WEBVTT

00:08.006 --> 00:10.442
DOUGLAS, WILL YOU
PLEASE PASS THE CATSUP?

00:10.543 --> 00:11.943
THE WHAT?

00:12.011 --> 00:13.979
THE CATSUP.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.784
YOU MEAN THE KETCHUP?

00:21.420 --> 00:25.623
EDUCATED PEOPLE
PRONOUNCE IT CATSUP.

00:25.691 --> 00:28.560
NOT IF THEY WANT ME
TO PASS IT TO THEM.

00:28.644 --> 00:30.495
FINE. IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU'RE GOING TO BE,

00:30.563 --> 00:31.963
THEN I'LL DO WITHOUT.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.266
NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
OLD MAN.

00:35.334 --> 00:36.500
MY BURGER'S
GETTING COLD.

00:36.568 --> 00:37.769
JUST GIVE ME
THE CATSUP!

00:37.837 --> 00:39.137
OK, IT'S CALLED KETCHUP.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.106
SAY IT RIGHT AND YOU CAN HAVE IT. NO.

00:41.173 --> 00:43.074
SAY IT. SAY IT. NO.

00:43.159 --> 00:44.108
I WILL
NEVER SAY IT.

00:44.176 --> 00:47.278
I'D RATHER DIE
THAN SAY IT.

00:47.330 --> 00:49.598
THEN SHE'S
STAYING OVER HERE.

00:49.665 --> 00:52.867
ME LLAMO KETCHUP.

00:52.868 --> 00:54.369
FINE.

00:54.436 --> 00:56.371
THEN JUST SAY
GOOD-BYE TO THESE.

00:56.438 --> 00:57.972
AHH!

00:58.091 --> 00:59.240
WHY YOU GOTTA DO THAT?

00:59.308 --> 01:00.976
YOU WANT THE CATSUP,
YOU CAN HAVE THE CATSUP.

01:01.043 --> 01:02.643
HERE. GOD.

01:05.047 --> 01:05.981
THANK YOU.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:06.048 --> 01:07.148
OK, GOOD.

01:07.216 --> 01:08.233
THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:08.301 --> 01:10.435
THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:10.503 --> 01:11.769
THAT'S ENOUGH!

01:11.837 --> 01:12.521
OH, IS THAT ENOUGH?

01:12.588 --> 01:13.904
YES, THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:13.972 --> 01:15.673
THAN SAY IT!
SAY-SAY IT!

01:15.741 --> 01:17.275
WHAT?

02:03.606 --> 02:05.239
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S NEXT?

02:05.324 --> 02:09.711
"PUT BRACKET C FACING
LEFT FRONT QUARTER.

02:09.779 --> 02:13.314
TURN TO ALIGN
WITH REAR BRACING LEG."

02:16.419 --> 02:18.152
WHAT?

02:18.254 --> 02:19.403
I THINK
IT MEANS THE SEAT

02:19.471 --> 02:22.023
IS SUPPOSED TO CONNECT
TO BRACKET C.

02:22.091 --> 02:23.842
THERE'S ALREADY
A WHEEL IN BRACKET C.

02:23.909 --> 02:25.142
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE THE SEAT.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.277
YEAH, WELL,
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

02:26.345 --> 02:28.880
COME ON, GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO PUT IN SLOT H.

02:28.948 --> 02:32.249
I- I'D PUT THE SEAT THERE.

02:33.669 --> 02:37.505
PUT THIS RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT LIKE THAT.

02:39.041 --> 02:43.010
YEAH, SEE? ALL DONE.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.129
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.314
ALL RIGHT, BY THE WAY,
MAJOR'S NOT GONNA BE GETTING

02:46.382 --> 02:47.982
THE GREATEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT
FROM US EITHER.

02:48.050 --> 02:50.552
WE'RE A LITTLE SHORT
ON THE DOUGH-RE-MI.

02:50.619 --> 02:51.469
OH, YEAH.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.854
HOW'S CARRIE'S
JOB HUNT GOING?

02:53.922 --> 02:54.989
SHE'S GETTING
A LITTLE DESPERATE.

02:55.056 --> 02:56.540
NEXT TIME YOU CALL
A PHONE SEX LINE,

02:56.608 --> 02:58.243
BE NICE JUST IN CASE.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.246

03:04.583 --> 03:05.650
HI, DAD.

03:05.718 --> 03:06.735
HEY, GUYS.
YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME?

03:06.802 --> 03:09.354
WE MADE
JESSE'S HAMSTER FLY.

03:09.422 --> 03:10.855
REALLY?
WELL, HE FLEW BRIEFLY.

03:10.923 --> 03:13.558
LET'S JUST SAY HE'LL BE
OFF THE WHEEL FOR A WHILE.

03:13.626 --> 03:16.010
YOU WANT TO SEE MY ROOM?

03:16.078 --> 03:18.930
HEY, SEAN. THIS IS MY
FRIEND DOUG HEFFERNAN.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.364
DOUG HEFFERNAN?

03:20.432 --> 03:21.866
DID YOU GO
TO SAINT GREGORY'S?

03:21.934 --> 03:23.051
YEAH.

03:23.118 --> 03:24.786
IT'S ME. SEAN McGEE.

03:24.854 --> 03:26.637
OH, HEY, MAN. HI!

03:26.705 --> 03:29.056
HI! HI!
HOW'S IT GOING?

03:29.125 --> 03:30.057
GOOD.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.628
AH, ALL WHITE GUYS
DO KNOW EACH OTHER.

03:33.695 --> 03:36.264
SMALL WORLD. WHAT
HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

03:36.332 --> 03:38.583
JUST WORKING WITH DEACON
DOWN AT I.P.S.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.635
THAT'S GREAT. I'M A D.A.
OVER IN QUEENS COUNTY.

03:40.703 --> 03:42.470
YOU KNOW, PUTTING AWAY
THE BAD GUYS.

03:42.538 --> 03:44.121
HEY, DEAD MAN WALKING,
RIGHT?

03:44.189 --> 03:45.823
HA HA HA!

03:45.891 --> 03:48.158
LISTEN, I GOTTA GO.
HEY, JESS!

03:48.226 --> 03:50.028
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.029
ARE YOU GONNA BE
AT MAJOR'S PARTY?

03:51.097 --> 03:52.263
YUP. I'LL SEE YOU OVER THERE.

03:52.331 --> 03:53.732
TAKE CARE, DEAC.
TAKE CARE, MAN.

03:53.799 --> 03:55.433
HEY, YOU TAKE CARE,
DOUG.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.335
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
BE GOOD.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.520
HA HA HA HA.

03:59.588 --> 04:02.674
I HATE
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

04:02.741 --> 04:04.342
WHAT?!

04:04.409 --> 04:06.043
IT WAS SEVENTH GRADE.

04:06.111 --> 04:07.361
I WAS IN THE CAFETERIA,
AND I ACCIDENTALLY THREW OUT

04:07.429 --> 04:09.430
<i>MY SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN
THERMOS TOP.</i>

04:09.498 --> 04:11.599
SO I'M GOING THROUGH
THE GARBAGE LOOKING FOR IT,

04:11.667 --> 04:14.251
AND SEAN McGEE
TOLD EVERYBODY THAT I...

04:14.319 --> 04:17.154
LICKED THE TRASH CAN.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.128
DID YOU LICK IT?

04:23.179 --> 04:25.362
NO! WHY WOULD I
LICK A TRASH CAN?

04:25.431 --> 04:26.113
I DON'T KNOW.
THE SAME REASON

04:26.265 --> 04:28.566
YOU LICK THE TOP
OF THE PIZZA BOX.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.900
THAT'S COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT, ALL RIGHT?

04:29.969 --> 04:31.369
THAT'S NOT TRASH YET.

04:31.470 --> 04:33.388
ANYWAY, HE SPREAD THIS
AROUND THE WHOLE SCHOOL,

04:33.455 --> 04:34.723
AND FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR,

04:34.840 --> 04:38.459
EVERYBODY CALLED ME
DOUG HEFFER-CAN.

04:38.477 --> 04:40.378
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M GONNA
SEE SEAN ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

04:40.445 --> 04:42.713
I'LL BE SURE TO STAY
AWAY FROM ANY TRASH CANS.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.382
WAIT A SECOND.

04:44.449 --> 04:45.984
I JUST TOLD YOU
THIS GUY IS MY ENEMY,

04:46.051 --> 04:48.019
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HANG OUT WITH HIM?

04:48.153 --> 04:49.103
I'M NOT IN LOVE
WITH THE GUY.

04:49.170 --> 04:50.204
WE'RE JUST PLAYING
RACQUETBALL.

04:50.272 --> 04:51.873
NOBODY ELSE PLAYS.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

04:51.907 --> 04:54.108
DON'T PLAY WITH SEAN McGEE.
PLAY WITH ME!

04:54.176 --> 04:55.326
YOU DON'T PLAY.

04:55.394 --> 04:58.947
DON'T PLAY?
WHAT, ARE YOU ON POT?

04:59.014 --> 05:01.015
I LOVE RACQUETBALL.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.900
YEAH? WHAT COLOR
ARE THE BALLS?

05:02.968 --> 05:04.385
THEY VARY.

05:06.237 --> 05:06.987
LOOK, GIVE ME
A CHANCE, ALL RIGHT?

05:07.139 --> 05:08.239
IF I DON'T GIVE YOU
A GOOD GAME,

05:08.306 --> 05:11.475
YOU CAN GO PLAY WITH
YOUR FRIEND SEAN McGAY.

05:12.894 --> 05:16.580
DAMN, I WISH I'D THOUGHT
OF THAT IN JUNIOR HIGH.

05:24.623 --> 05:27.291
YEAH.

05:27.359 --> 05:28.443
YEAH, I FEEL IT.

05:28.510 --> 05:30.144
OK, NEXT TIME YOU HAVE
TO STRETCH LIKE THAT,

05:30.212 --> 05:33.080
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO WEAR LONGER SHORTS.

05:33.148 --> 05:35.232
YEAH? AND I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO STAND BACK

05:35.300 --> 05:36.834
BECAUSE IT'S PUNISH TIME.

05:36.902 --> 05:37.935
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO BE ACQUAINTED

05:38.003 --> 05:42.389
WITH MY GOOD FRIENDS
HUGH AND MILLIE YAYSHIN.

05:45.276 --> 05:47.512
WASSUP?

05:51.366 --> 05:52.299
OHH!

06:04.379 --> 06:05.563

06:07.082 --> 06:08.166
UHH!

06:19.578 --> 06:20.712
ALL RIGHT,
I ADMIT IT, MAN.

06:20.779 --> 06:22.513
YOU GOT GAME.
REALLY?

06:22.581 --> 06:24.898
I THINK SOMEONE
OWES ME AN APOLOGY.

06:24.966 --> 06:27.351
OH, GOD.

06:27.419 --> 06:29.253
DAMN!

06:29.320 --> 06:31.372
ALL RIGHT, MY SERVE.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.541
I THINK
WE'RE DONE HERE.

06:33.608 --> 06:36.477
COME ON, THAT'S FINE.
THROW A LITTLE SAWDUST ON IT.

06:36.545 --> 06:37.745
WHERE YOU GOING?

06:37.847 --> 06:40.014
YOU'RE GONNA CALL YOUR
BOYFRIEND, AREN'T YOU?

06:40.081 --> 06:41.298
AT LEAST HE CAN PLAY 4
POINTS WITHOUT SHOWING ME

06:41.366 --> 06:42.900
WHAT HE HAD
AT THE SNACK BAR.

06:42.968 --> 06:44.852
FINE!
I DON'T NEED YOU!

06:44.920 --> 06:47.421
BUT KNOW THIS
- IF YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH MY ENEMY,

06:47.489 --> 06:49.957
THEN YOU'RE
MY ENEMY!

06:50.025 --> 06:52.660
OH, GOD.

06:55.697 --> 06:59.367
SO, UH, WITH DEACON GONE,
HOW'S THIS GONNA WORK?

06:59.434 --> 07:02.053
DOES EVERYBODY JUST MOVE
UP A SLOT, FRIEND-WISE?

07:03.521 --> 07:04.488
NO.

07:04.556 --> 07:07.125
WELL, I JUST MEAN,
YOU KNOW,

07:07.192 --> 07:08.592
THERE WAS STUFF
YOU USED TO DO WITH DEACON,

07:08.660 --> 07:11.028
SO I GUESS YOU'LL BE DOING IT
WITH ONE OF US NOW.

07:11.096 --> 07:13.748
NO.

07:13.816 --> 07:15.399
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S COOL.

07:15.467 --> 07:18.435
STATUS QUO.

07:18.503 --> 07:20.605
GOD, I REALLY MISS DEAC.

07:20.672 --> 07:22.807
I MEAN, THE WAY
HE GOT SUCH A KICK

07:22.874 --> 07:25.542
OUT OF THESE
BUD LIGHT COMMERCIALS.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.311
THERE'S A CERTAIN KIND
OF MAGIC

07:27.378 --> 07:30.881
WHEN A GENTLE GIANT LAUGHS.

07:37.472 --> 07:38.506
HEY.

07:38.574 --> 07:39.774
OH.

07:39.842 --> 07:41.008
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

07:41.076 --> 07:42.509
JUST CAME TO GET
MY CAMCORDER BACK.

07:42.577 --> 07:44.678
I NEED IT FOR
MY KID'S PARTY TOMORROW.

07:44.713 --> 07:46.614
HELP YOURSELF.
IT'S IN THE GARAGE.

07:46.665 --> 07:48.065
THE GARAGE? HUH.

07:48.133 --> 07:50.151
THANKS FOR TAKING
SUCH GOOD CARE OF IT.

07:51.837 --> 07:53.437
HEY, DEAC.

07:53.472 --> 07:55.606
WHAT'S UP?

07:55.724 --> 07:57.825
OK, PUT YOUR EYES
BACK IN YOUR HEAD.

07:59.278 --> 08:00.611
HELLO.

08:02.898 --> 08:04.565
GONNA NEED YOU

08:06.768 --> 08:08.002
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
COME IN FOR A SECOND?

08:08.070 --> 08:09.103
YOU KNOW,
I NEVER SIGN ANYTHING

08:09.170 --> 08:10.838
WITHOUT CHECKING OVER
THE FINE PRINT ANYWAY.

08:10.906 --> 08:12.941
'CAUSE THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
I'M SOMEBODY'S BUTLER FOR LIFE.

08:13.008 --> 08:14.642
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?

08:14.709 --> 08:16.193
NOT AT ALL, NO.

08:16.261 --> 08:17.729
IT'S JUST
A STANDARD LETTER.

08:17.796 --> 08:18.479
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
COME ON IN.

08:18.547 --> 08:20.481
COME ON,

08:20.548 --> 08:22.099
JUST TAKE A SEAT RIGHT

08:22.167 --> 08:24.402
OK, BUT I

08:24.469 --> 08:25.703
WELL, THAT'S OK.

08:25.770 --> 08:28.272
DOUG HEFFERNAN."

08:28.340 --> 08:30.208
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

08:30.342 --> 08:32.076

09:01.923 --> 09:03.524
THAT'S-THAT'S CLASSY.

09:03.591 --> 09:05.927
HEY, I DON'T CARE IF MY BEST
FRIEND'S BLACK, WHITE, OR PURPLE, OK?

09:05.995 --> 09:08.562
AS LONG AS HE'S GOT MY BACK.
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, MELVIN?

09:08.631 --> 09:09.831
ACTUALLY, I
GOTTA HIT THE ROAD.

09:09.898 --> 09:11.699
LISTEN, SIGN
THAT SLIP WHENEVER.

09:11.767 --> 09:12.800
I'LL PICK IT UP

09:12.868 --> 09:14.368
IT IS A DATE,
AMIGO.

09:14.436 --> 09:15.202
YEAH!

09:15.270 --> 09:16.553
HEY, KNICKS FAN.

09:16.621 --> 09:18.156
MARBURY'S DOING

09:18.223 --> 09:19.857
YEAH, I TELL YOU,

09:19.925 --> 09:21.125
I HEARD THAT.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.260
I'M ACTUALLY HEADING
OVER TO COOPER'S

09:22.327 --> 09:23.327
TO CATCH

09:23.395 --> 09:24.328
OH, YEAH?

09:24.396 --> 09:25.729
OH, MAYBE I'LL STOP BY

09:28.333 --> 09:29.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:29.534 --> 09:31.235
TRYING TO JAZZ UP
MY RESUME,

09:31.303 --> 09:33.070
SEE IF I CAN GET A
LAW FIRM TO NOTICE ME.

09:33.138 --> 09:34.405
HOW'S THIS SOUND?

09:34.473 --> 09:38.125
"CLEAVAGE AVAILABLE
UPON REQUEST."

09:39.544 --> 09:40.811
IT SOUNDS GOOD.
GIVE IT A TRY.

09:40.879 --> 09:42.246
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

09:42.313 --> 09:44.514
FRIGGIN' DEACON.

09:44.582 --> 09:45.833
HE'S HANGING OUT
WITH MY ARCH-ENEMY.

09:45.901 --> 09:47.402
THEIR KIDS GO
TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

09:47.469 --> 09:50.171
YOU HAVE AN ARCH-ENEMY?

09:50.239 --> 09:51.622
YEAH, SEAN McGEE.

09:51.690 --> 09:53.023
IN SEVENTH GRADE,
HE TOLD EVERYONE

09:53.092 --> 09:56.360
I LICKED A TRASH CAN.

09:56.428 --> 09:58.262
DID YOU?

09:58.330 --> 10:00.031
NO.

10:00.098 --> 10:01.698
WHY WOULD I LICK
A TRASH CAN?

10:01.766 --> 10:02.850
I DON'T KNOW.
DIDN'T YOU ONCE TELL ME

10:02.918 --> 10:06.053
YOU ATE THAT FEED
THEY HAVE AT PETTING ZOOS?

10:07.555 --> 10:10.024
MY SISTER TOLD ME IF I DID,
I COULD GROW A MUSTACHE.

10:15.897 --> 10:17.564
IT'S NOT THE POINT, OK?

10:17.632 --> 10:19.433
I DIDN'T LICK A TRASH CAN.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.718
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU BETTER GET OVER IT

10:20.786 --> 10:22.487
BEFORE MAJOR'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY TOMORROW

10:22.554 --> 10:24.722
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE ANY AWKWARD SCENES.

10:24.790 --> 10:25.589
THERE AIN'T GONNA BE
ANY AWKWARD SCENES

10:25.741 --> 10:26.874
'CAUSE I AIN'T
GOING TO ANY PARTY

10:26.942 --> 10:28.408
THAT SEAN McGEE'S
GONNA BE AT.

10:28.476 --> 10:29.577
DOUG, COME ON.

10:29.644 --> 10:32.747
THIS IS OVER
A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO!

10:32.814 --> 10:34.982
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
AM I HEARING THIS RIGHT?

10:35.049 --> 10:36.784
YOU'RE TELLING ME
I CAN'T HAVE ONE ENEMY?

10:36.852 --> 10:39.019
LET'S GO OVER
YOUR ENEMY LIST, HUH?

10:39.087 --> 10:40.637
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

10:40.705 --> 10:42.189
LORENZO'S PIZZERIA.
I CAN'T GO THERE ANYMORE

10:42.257 --> 10:43.357
BECAUSE YOU HAD
A FIGHT WITH THE GUY

10:43.425 --> 10:45.125
BECAUSE HE PUT TOO MUCH
CHEESE ON OUR PIZZA.

10:45.193 --> 10:46.460
TOO MUCH CHEESE.

10:46.528 --> 10:49.113
INSANITY!

10:50.949 --> 10:52.633
OR HOW ABOUT
SAN REMO DRY CLEANERS, HUH,

10:52.701 --> 10:55.536
WHERE THAT LITTLE
CHINESE GIRL SASSED YOU?

10:55.604 --> 10:57.155
YEAH, I MAY NOT
HAVE UNDERSTOOD HER,

10:57.222 --> 10:59.791
BUT SHE WAS ALL ATTITUDE.

10:59.858 --> 11:01.242
THE POINT IS,
I SUPPORT YOU

11:01.309 --> 11:02.777
IN EVERYTHING
YOU HATE.

11:02.845 --> 11:04.846
YOU KNOW, THE RESTAURANTS, THE STORES,

11:04.913 --> 11:06.848
MAGICIANS!

11:06.915 --> 11:08.382
IF YOU HATE IT,
I HATE IT.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.852
SO WHY CAN'T YOU BACK
ME UP ON THIS ONE THING?

11:11.920 --> 11:14.354
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW, YOU
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:14.389 --> 11:16.189
IF SEAN McGEE
IS YOUR ENEMY,

11:16.257 --> 11:18.526
THEN HE IS
MY ENEMY, TOO.

11:18.593 --> 11:19.226
THANK YOU.

11:19.294 --> 11:21.412
SO WE'RE NOT GOING
TO MAJOR'S PARTY?

11:21.479 --> 11:22.747
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO MAJOR'S PARTY.

11:22.814 --> 11:24.214
OK, I GUESS
I'LL GO OVER THERE

11:24.282 --> 11:26.533
AND DROP OFF
MAJOR'S GIFT TONIGHT.

11:26.601 --> 11:28.853
WAIT A SECOND. IS IT
SOMETHING I MIGHT WANT?

11:28.921 --> 11:31.539
DOUG, IT'S A PAIR
OF FEETY PAJAMAS.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.928
DOES IT
HAVE A BACK-FLAP?

11:42.234 --> 11:44.402
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANKS FOR
THE GAME. TAKE CARE, MAN.

11:44.469 --> 11:46.103
OH, SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

11:46.171 --> 11:47.638
I'M SORRY.
LET ME GET THAT.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.006
THANK YOU.

11:49.074 --> 11:50.341
"FROM DOUG AND CARRIE."

11:50.409 --> 11:52.577
ARE YOU MARRIED
TO DOUG HEFFERNAN?

11:52.628 --> 11:53.594
YEAH.

11:53.662 --> 11:54.545
I'M SEAN McGEE.

11:54.613 --> 11:55.780
I WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

11:55.831 --> 11:59.450
OH... YES.

12:00.669 --> 12:02.786
SEAN McGEE.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.

12:02.921 --> 12:03.570
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:03.722 --> 12:05.155
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.791
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, SEAN.

12:07.859 --> 12:09.760
YOU MESS WITH DOUG,
YOU MESS WITH ME.

12:09.828 --> 12:11.362
OK, YOU DON'T
WANT TO MESS WITH ME

12:11.430 --> 12:14.164
BECAUSE I WILL
TAKE YOU DOWN, OK?

12:14.183 --> 12:18.569
THIS IS ABOUT THE TRASH
CAN THING, ISN'T IT? YEAH.

12:18.636 --> 12:20.104
DEACON TOLD ME HE WAS
STILL UPSET ABOUT IT.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.838
I JUST FEEL TERRIBLE
ABOUT THAT.

12:21.907 --> 12:22.940
AS WELL YOU SHOULD.

12:23.025 --> 12:23.808
WHEN I SAW HIM
LICK THAT THING,

12:23.876 --> 12:26.177
I REALLY SHOULD HAVE
JUST KEPT IT TO MYSELF.

12:26.278 --> 12:29.997
WAIT A MINUTE.
SO HE REALLY DID LICK IT?

12:30.082 --> 12:32.666
OH, YEAH.
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.686
I SHOULD HAVE JUST KEPT
MY MOUTH SHUT, THOUGH.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.020
JUST TELL HIM
I'M SORRY, WOULD YOU?

12:37.089 --> 12:38.255
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

12:38.323 --> 12:40.374
I GOT 4 BIG CASES
I'M PROSECUTING,

12:40.441 --> 12:42.076
AND MY SECRETARY
JUST QUIT.

12:42.127 --> 12:43.977
OH, YOU'RE A LAWYER?
YEAH.

12:44.045 --> 12:45.429
AND YOUR SECRETARY
JUST QUIT?

12:45.497 --> 12:46.697
YEAH, A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

12:46.765 --> 12:47.798
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GONNA REPLACE HER.

12:47.866 --> 12:49.833
OH, 'CAUSE I USED
TO BE A LEGAL SECRETARY.

12:49.901 --> 12:54.255
YEAH, I WAS AT KAPLAN,
HORNSTEIN & STECKLER.

12:54.322 --> 12:56.157
OH, IT'S A GOOD FIRM.
I'VE HEARD OF THEM.

12:56.225 --> 12:57.458
WELL, I WOULD
ASK YOU TO COME IN

12:57.525 --> 12:58.826
AND, YOU KNOW,
DO AN INTERVIEW,

12:58.894 --> 13:00.694
BUT WE HAVE A POLICY
AGAINST HIRING PEOPLE

13:00.762 --> 13:02.663
WHO WANT TO
"TAKE ME DOWN."

13:02.731 --> 13:03.431
THAT'S FUNNY.

13:03.498 --> 13:04.915
HANG ON.

13:04.983 --> 13:06.651
SEAN, I'LL WALK
WITH YOU, BABE.

13:10.205 --> 13:11.138
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

13:11.206 --> 13:12.306
HE IS MY ENEMY.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.074
I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE CLEAR ABOUT THAT!

13:14.142 --> 13:15.792
YES, AND ISN'T THAT
WHAT THEY SAY?

13:15.860 --> 13:19.796
"KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE,
BUT YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER"?

13:19.864 --> 13:24.852
THIS WAY I CAN KEEP TABS
ON HIM 24/7.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.288
I CAN TAKE HIM DOWN
FROM THE INSIDE!

13:27.356 --> 13:28.956
YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS
IS NOT HAPPENING.

13:29.024 --> 13:30.324
THERE'S NO WAY.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.726
DOUG, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
NOT GONNA LET ME TAKE A JOB

13:32.794 --> 13:36.663
BECAUSE YOU LICKED A
TRASH CAN WHEN YOU WERE 12.

13:36.731 --> 13:39.166
WHOA.

13:39.234 --> 13:41.768
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU THINK
I LICKED THAT TRASH CAN?

13:41.836 --> 13:43.954
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS
SEAN IS PRETTY CONVINCED

13:44.022 --> 13:45.422
IN WHAT HE SAW.

13:45.490 --> 13:47.274
AND YOU BELIEVE HIM
OVER ME?

13:47.341 --> 13:48.075
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE THERE WAS

13:48.143 --> 13:49.560
SOMETHING GOOD
ON THE TRASH CAN!

13:49.628 --> 13:53.331
YOU KNOW, SOME LEFTOVER SLOPPY
JOE, SOME CHOCOLATE SAUCE.

13:53.398 --> 13:54.632
WHO CAN BLAME YA?

13:54.700 --> 13:57.584
I NEVER LICKED IT, OK?
FOR THE LAST TIME,

13:57.652 --> 13:59.887
MY HEAD WAS IN THAT TRASH
CAN BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING FOR

13:59.955 --> 14:02.456
<i>MY SIX MILLION DOLLAR
MAN THERMOS TOP!</i>

14:02.523 --> 14:04.641
LOOK, YOU LICKED IT,
YOU DIDN'T LICK IT,

14:04.709 --> 14:06.276
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

14:06.344 --> 14:07.345
THERE'S
A BIG DIFFERENCE!

14:07.495 --> 14:11.098
ONE WAY,
I LICKED A TRASH CAN!

14:11.166 --> 14:12.299
THE OTHER WAY, I DIDN'T!

14:12.366 --> 14:14.334
AND I DIDN'T.

14:14.402 --> 14:17.604
OK, AND SEAN FEELS
REALLY BAD ABOUT THIS.

14:17.672 --> 14:19.006
PLEASE, JUST COME
TO THE PARTY

14:19.074 --> 14:21.775
AND LET SEAN
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

14:21.843 --> 14:24.778
I WILL NOT STEP FOOT
AT ANY PARTY

14:24.846 --> 14:28.149
OR ANYWHERE ELSE
THAT MAN WILL BE.

14:28.216 --> 14:29.984
HE IS MY ENEMY,

14:30.052 --> 14:32.686
AND NOW
YOU ARE MY ENEMY.

14:34.156 --> 14:36.040
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU ARE BEING RIDICULOUS.

14:36.107 --> 14:38.676
I AM GONNA GO LIVE
IN A WORLD WITH ADULTS.

14:38.743 --> 14:40.343
YOU CAN STAY
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE

14:40.411 --> 14:42.279
AND LICK YOUR TRASH CANS
BY YOURSELF.

14:43.198 --> 14:44.147
TRAITOR!

14:44.215 --> 14:46.350
TRASH CAN LICKER!

14:48.620 --> 14:51.088
OK, I'M OFF
TO MAJOR'S PARTY.

14:51.155 --> 14:53.057
YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN STILL COME.

14:53.141 --> 14:55.009
HMM, THANKS.
NAH, I THINK I'LL STAY HOME

14:55.076 --> 14:58.578
AND ENJOY MY EXTRA CHEESY
LORENZO'S PIZZA.

15:00.148 --> 15:03.250
WHOOPS. I GOT A LITTLE
CHEESE ON MY SHIRT.

15:03.318 --> 15:04.518
THAT'S NO PROBLEM
BECAUSE I KNOW

15:04.585 --> 15:07.421
A LITTLE SASSY CHINESE GIRL
WHO'LL GET THAT RIGHT OUT.

15:14.896 --> 15:18.032
OOH, PIZZA PIE.
MAY I?

15:18.083 --> 15:19.266
YEAH, YOU CAN
HAVE THE REST, ACTUALLY.

15:19.334 --> 15:21.802
IT'S PRETTY BAD.

15:21.870 --> 15:24.271
WELL, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE EATING.

15:24.339 --> 15:28.041
MY QUESTION IS,
WHAT'S EATING YOU?

15:29.227 --> 15:32.162
JUST DEACON AND CARRIE.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.331
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

15:34.399 --> 15:36.333
IN SEVENTH GRADE,
I HAD THIS ENEMY,

15:36.401 --> 15:39.970
AND, WELL, CARRIE
AND DEACON ARE SIDING

15:40.038 --> 15:41.505
WITH HIM OVER ME.

15:41.572 --> 15:43.206
WHAT'S YOUR BEEF
WITH THIS FELLOW?

15:43.225 --> 15:47.694
HE TOLD EVERYONE
I LICKED A TRASH CAN.

15:47.762 --> 15:50.880
DID YOU?

15:50.948 --> 15:54.618
NO, BUT HE TOLD
EVERYONE I DID.

15:54.686 --> 15:57.554
DOUGLAS,
THERE'S NO SHAME

15:57.622 --> 15:59.923
IN BEING
A TRASH CAN LICKER.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.779
NEVER LICKED IT.

16:04.846 --> 16:07.247
WELL, I KNOW FROM
WHENCE YOU COME.

16:07.315 --> 16:09.917
I, TOO, HAD
A BOYHOOD ENEMY.

16:09.984 --> 16:11.385
HE GOT ME
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL

16:11.453 --> 16:16.657
WHEN HE CLAIMED I STOLE
HIS MOE BERG BASEBALL CARD.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.342
WHY DID HE SAY THAT?

16:18.409 --> 16:20.861
WELL, BECAUSE
I HAD STOLEN IT.

16:20.928 --> 16:24.097
I LOVED IT, AND I WANTED IT FOR MYSELF.

16:25.967 --> 16:27.985
ANYWAY, DO YOU KNOW
WHO THIS PALE KID

16:28.053 --> 16:31.605
WITH THE BIG MOUTH
TURNED OUT TO BE?

16:31.673 --> 16:35.375
TV JOURNALIST AND
CELEBRITY SUCKHOUND

16:35.443 --> 16:37.845
LARRY KING.

16:43.218 --> 16:44.934
OK, GREAT.
THANKS FOR THE TALK.

16:45.002 --> 16:47.103
MY POINT IS
WHEN HE BECAME A SUCCESS

16:47.172 --> 16:48.822
I WAS MAD
AT EVERYONE BUT HIM.

16:48.889 --> 16:51.308
CNN, HIS SPONSORS,

16:51.376 --> 16:54.861
THE SUSPENDER INDUSTRY.

16:54.929 --> 16:57.898
IF I HAD JUST FOCUSED
ON HATING HIM,

16:57.965 --> 17:02.002
I WOULD HAVE SAVED MYSELF
A LOT OF HEARTACHE.

17:02.069 --> 17:04.037
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:04.105 --> 17:06.272
SEAN McGEE'S
MY PROBLEM HERE.

17:06.340 --> 17:07.473
I'M GOING
TO MAJOR'S PARTY.

17:07.541 --> 17:08.608
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE
OF THIS RIGHT NOW.

17:08.675 --> 17:09.943
WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD THE PHONE.

17:10.011 --> 17:11.711
MAJOR'S
HAVING A PARTY?

17:11.779 --> 17:12.480
YEAH.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.531
AND I WASN'T INVITED?

17:14.598 --> 17:19.619
THAT FICKLE LITTLE BASTARD
JUST CROSSED THE WRONG GUY.

17:28.613 --> 17:29.813
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

17:29.881 --> 17:32.249
I CAME DOWN TO TAKE CARE
OF A LITTLE BUSINESS.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.450
UH-HUH.

17:33.518 --> 17:34.585
AM I GONNA HAVE
TO KICK YOUR ASS

17:34.652 --> 17:36.086
AT MY KID'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY?

17:36.138 --> 17:38.589
NO, NO, WE'RE COOL.

17:38.657 --> 17:41.208
I JUST NEED TO HAVE
A LITTLE CHAT WITH...

17:41.426 --> 17:43.644
SEAN McGEE.

17:44.779 --> 17:46.580
HEY, SEAN!

17:46.648 --> 17:47.814
WOULD YOU COME ON DOWN FOR A SECOND?

17:47.882 --> 17:48.982
I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

17:49.050 --> 17:49.850
COULD WE DO IT LATER?

17:49.917 --> 17:51.268
I'M TRYING TO PLAY
WITH MY KID HERE.

17:51.335 --> 17:52.402
NO, NOT LATER.

17:52.470 --> 17:53.604
NOW.

17:53.671 --> 17:55.505
JUST GIVE ME
5 MINUTES.

18:19.197 --> 18:20.964
HEY.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.301
HEY, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE WEARING SHOES UP HERE.

18:24.368 --> 18:26.503
WHATEVER.
LOOK, I KNOW

18:26.571 --> 18:28.439
CARRIE'S GONNA BE WORKING
FOR YOU, AND THAT'S GREAT.

18:28.506 --> 18:32.309
IT'S JUST I THINK WE NEED TO
CLEAR THE AIR BETWEEN US FIRST.

18:32.376 --> 18:34.728
DOUG, ABOUT ALL THAT,
I KNOW IT'S NO EXCUSE,

18:34.795 --> 18:36.563
BUT I WAS A STUPID KID,
ALL RIGHT?

18:36.630 --> 18:39.599
I'M SORRY I TOLD EVERYBODY
YOU LICKED A TRASH CAN.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.301
REALLY?

18:41.369 --> 18:42.419
YEAH, I FEEL TERRIBLE

18:42.486 --> 18:44.387
YOU'VE BEEN CARRYING THAT
AROUND ALL THESE YEARS.

18:44.455 --> 18:47.390
YOU KNOW, I JUST HOPE
YOU ACCEPT MY APOLOGY.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.310
WELL, YEAH, I DO.

18:50.378 --> 18:52.045
THANKS FOR
SAYING SOMETHING.

18:52.113 --> 18:53.313
NO PROBLEM.

18:53.381 --> 18:54.715
SEE YOU AROUND
THE PIÑATA.

18:54.783 --> 18:55.716
OK.

18:58.886 --> 19:00.287
WAIT.

19:02.039 --> 19:04.708
I JUST WANT TO CLEAR
SOMETHING UP HERE.

19:04.775 --> 19:05.959
WHAT, DOUG?

19:06.026 --> 19:07.561
YOU SAID YOU WERE SORRY
YOU TOLD EVERYONE

19:07.629 --> 19:10.364
THAT I LICKED
THE TRASH CAN.

19:10.431 --> 19:12.449
BUT YOU NEVER APOLOGIZED
FOR MAKING UP THE FACT

19:12.516 --> 19:13.650
THAT I LICKED IT.

19:13.718 --> 19:16.787
BUT YOU DID.
NO, I DIDN'T.

19:16.854 --> 19:19.122
DOUG, I SAW YOU
LICK THE TRASH CAN.

19:19.190 --> 19:21.257
OK, FOR THE LAST TIME,
I WAS LOOKING FOR

19:21.326 --> 19:23.627
<i>MY SIX MILLION DOLLAR
MAN THERMOS TOP.</i>

19:23.695 --> 19:26.629
CAN I JUST PLAY
WITH MY KID?

19:26.697 --> 19:27.630
EXCUSE ME.

19:27.698 --> 19:29.366
IT'S OK.
I WORK HERE.

19:30.634 --> 19:31.668
LOOK, YOU CAN PLAY
WITH YOUR KID

19:31.736 --> 19:32.586
AS SOON AS
YOU ADMIT TO ME

19:32.654 --> 19:34.071
THAT I DIDN'T
LICK IT.

19:34.138 --> 19:36.189
OK, YOU DIDN'T LICK
THE TRASH CAN.

19:36.257 --> 19:38.859
OK, I'M SORRY
I MADE THAT UP.

19:38.927 --> 19:42.646
OK, YOU JUST SAID "MADE IT
UP" AS IF IT WERE IN QUOTES.

19:42.714 --> 19:43.763
DOUG, THIS
IS RIDICULOUS, OK?

19:43.831 --> 19:45.199
CAN WE PLEASE FORGET IT?

19:45.266 --> 19:46.567
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

19:46.634 --> 19:47.701
BECAUSE I THINK
I SAW SOME PUDDING

19:47.768 --> 19:48.735
IN THE GARBAGE
OVER THERE

19:48.803 --> 19:50.204
AND IT HAD YOUR NAME
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT,

19:50.271 --> 19:51.938
HEFFER-CAN.

19:52.006 --> 19:54.408
AAH!

20:00.315 --> 20:03.901
AAH! UHH!

20:03.968 --> 20:05.802
ADMIT IT!

20:05.904 --> 20:07.604

LICK IT!

20:07.671 --> 20:08.671

20:28.359 --> 20:29.659
