WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:04.520
Is it a signal?
Signal. Good lad.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.800
And into our manoeuvre.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.720
Nice and slow.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.080
But not that slow.
Hurry up, will ya?

00:13.120 --> 00:15.040
Sorry, I'm a learner.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.760
Easing her round to the left.
Can we swop over?

00:17.800 --> 00:21.360
We'll have none of that. You must
learn the U-turn at some point.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.760
We're keeping calm,
feeling confident.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.200
Oi, drive, you dickhead!

00:26.240 --> 00:28.520
Ignoring that, if you can.
I'm not sure I can.

00:28.560 --> 00:32.119
Come on, kiddo.
I'm telling you you can do this.

00:32.159 --> 00:37.160
Which means one of two things,
either you can or I'm a liar.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.960
And am I a liar?
No.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.520
No, I'm not.
I'm the best in the bizzle.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.320
So, easing around.
OK, yeah. I'm doing it.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.600
I'm doing it.
Sort it out, you goon!

00:46.640 --> 00:50.560
No, I can't do it. I'm sorry.
Swapping over, then. Out you pop.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.640
Watching out for any pedestrians.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.400
Ow! Sorry! Sorry.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.960
Really sorry. I'm a learner.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.040
Albus reckons, at this rate, I can
be in the arena in three months.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.120
Are you that bad?
It's only across town.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.120
No, as a charioteer, obviously.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.640
Marcus, quick question.
What?

01:27.680 --> 01:29.880
Will you be my best man?

01:30.400 --> 01:33.160
Sorry?
Will you be my best man?

01:33.200 --> 01:35.360
Didn't know you were marrying.
I am.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.200
Didn't know you had a girlfriend.
I have. I am.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.240
Will you be my best man?

01:40.280 --> 01:42.640
Who is she?
Her name's Drusilla.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.920
And why is she marrying you?
Cos I'm amazing.

01:44.960 --> 01:48.280
Yeah, but seriously, why?
Cos I've known her for ages.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.320
Then why have we never met her?
She doesn't go out much.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.160
You keep her locked in a box?
No, because she has brittle bones.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.440
Brittle bones. Of course!
Did you go over your brittle boner?

01:58.480 --> 02:00.360
No.
So that's what you have in common?

02:00.400 --> 02:02.640
How brittle is your boner?
It's not.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.640
Did I snap it off?
Like a little icicle.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.039
My boner can break a man's arm.
Gosh.

02:08.080 --> 02:11.600
Only in self-defence, I hope.
Absolutely.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.840
He's getting married.
Oh, how charmingly naive.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.760
Thanks. Marcus will be my best man.
I haven't agreed to it yet.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.480
Oh, why not?
Yeah, why not?

02:23.240 --> 02:27.200
Um... Because -
You think he's an insufferable prick

02:27.240 --> 02:31.040
and you want nothing to do with it?
No, I don't think that.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.240
We're good mates, aren't we?
Big time.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.440
Please do it, mate.
You're my best man.

02:37.280 --> 02:41.400
Oh, look how desperate he is.
It's making me nauseous.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.280
Y-eee-s?
Yes!

02:45.320 --> 02:47.440
Yes! Get him there!

02:48.080 --> 02:50.280
Yes... Sorry. Yes.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.480
Salve, Grumio.
All right, landlord?

03:09.520 --> 03:13.160
Stroking the chickens again?
Yeah, it's making me well hungry.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.680
Understandably.
What were all that about?

03:15.720 --> 03:18.640
Oh, we're dealing in seeds.
Selling them.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.920
It's all perfectly legit.
Seeds? What for?

03:21.960 --> 03:23.760
Well, for food.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.200
It's no wonder
he's so bloody skinny.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.080
They're more of a delicacy
than a slap-up meal.

03:29.120 --> 03:32.880
Who'd want that?
Well, these... chefs.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.920
Oh, he's a chef, is he?
That he is.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.680
Davus, see to the chef, would you?
Oh, chefs. Yeah, right.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.920
Yeah, it's a real foodie favourite.
A bit gourmet.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.400
Dead tasty, then, is it?
Oh, it's very moreish.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.880
It's his third lot this week.
I'll give you a sample.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.920
First lot's for free,
then I'll rinse ya.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.080
Enjoy.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.640
Gourmet. Well, la-di-da.

04:00.920 --> 04:04.080
Got to plan the stag,
write a bloody speech.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.840
What can I say?
I've only ever seen him pour water.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.720
Maybe say how little he spills it.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.000
Is that Cynthia? Cynthia!

04:15.560 --> 04:18.120
Hey. Cynthia?

04:18.839 --> 04:20.839
Cynthia?

04:20.880 --> 04:24.200
Oh, hi. Didn't see you there.
OK. Think you did, but -

04:24.240 --> 04:28.360
What's with the cat suit?
Just promoting a piece of theatre

04:28.400 --> 04:31.720
where I play the part
of a talking cat who serves drinks.

04:32.520 --> 04:36.040
So you're a waitress?
Yep. It's a bit embarrassing.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.200
Ah, waitressing's all right.
In my heart, I'm still an actress.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.880
"Kitten Club Casino and Bar
Caturday Miaowdness."

04:43.920 --> 04:46.400
Saturday madness.
A bit ambitious.

04:46.760 --> 04:52.000
"Half-price drinks to get you
feline good." Hey, purrfect.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.960
No. No way. Bringing pissed-up
pricks to Cynthia's workplace

04:56.000 --> 04:59.520
will not reflect well on me.
She was looking for punters.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.240
Last time, Aurelius
stuck his tongue down her throat.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.800
We're not taking the stag do there.
No way.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.400
Mmm. This is... weird.

05:08.840 --> 05:12.640
It is, actually. Why is it weird?
As you always slag off me food,

05:12.680 --> 05:16.440
I've added gourmet seeds landlord's
been flogging to the chefs.

05:16.480 --> 05:20.800
Chefs? What chefs?
Them pale, skinny blokes outside.

05:21.320 --> 05:25.040
What, the drug addicts? Have you
spiked our dinner with drugs?

05:25.080 --> 05:28.360
Oh, he said they were chefs. Sorry.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.800
Don't be. It's awesome.
No, spit it out.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.160
But I want to eat the drugs.
On a Thursday? At home?

05:34.200 --> 05:37.640
You wanna take loads of drugs?
It'll screw up your driving.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.800
And shrivel your penis.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.400
Yeah, it was inevitable.

05:44.440 --> 05:48.360
After 15 years of marriage, she
now finds me physically repulsive.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.680
Just creeping out.
So, what about the kids?

05:50.720 --> 05:52.760
Oh, they're troopers,
they really are.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.040
Minding the kerb.
They're putting a brave face on it.

05:56.080 --> 06:00.760
Obviously, at some point they'll
crack. "Give us back our daddy!"

06:00.800 --> 06:03.520
They're not saying it yet, but...
Stuck in the gutter.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.960
Don't worry.
This is the biggest bitch of all.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.480
I'll take the reins.
Just easing around.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.720
Easing around there.
See? Easing around.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.040
Yeah!
On the plus side,

06:15.120 --> 06:18.560
I'm psyched about being single.
I'm like a kid in a sweet shop, me.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.720
You're single, right?
Always. Can I have the reins now?

06:21.760 --> 06:25.440
Me and you should hit the town.
If you reckon you can keep up.

06:25.480 --> 06:29.560
Oh, don't you worry about me, kiddo.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.280
You're looking at a man
who whilst on holiday in Crete

06:32.320 --> 06:35.200
had sex with identical triplets.
Minding your speed.

06:35.240 --> 06:39.400
It's hard. I kept forgetting
which one I was working on.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.960
Oh, watching out for the pedestrian.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.600
Nevertheless,
I brought all three to climax

06:44.640 --> 06:48.080
and then I made them a casserole.
So, ooh, hang on, yeah.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.600
Reckon I could keep up.
Now, on your trot.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.200
Staying in your lane. Yeah?

06:55.240 --> 06:58.400
I want cocktails, costumes, fun.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.800
I want the whole night
to just scream Aurelius.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.920
Yeah, I'm ready to do that now.
Want a club full of hotties.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.120
Yeah, you said that.
All dancing with me.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.200
Harder to arrange, but OK.
Marcus, mate,

07:08.240 --> 07:10.560
this has to be the night
to end all nights.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.880
So, my bitches,
how's the stag coming on?

07:12.920 --> 07:16.080
My best man's being a bit negative.
I'm just worried about cost,

07:16.120 --> 07:18.320
given the small guest list.
Who's coming?

07:18.360 --> 07:22.040
People have been tricky to pin down.
All his closest friends

07:22.080 --> 07:25.800
are serving overseas in the army.
That's true. They are. They are.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.200
It's basically us three,
paying for everything. Really?

07:29.240 --> 07:32.160
No, I'm not paying. I'm the stag.
The stag doesn't pay.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.760
Of course not.
Maybe ask the other guys from work.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.960
From the main office. They love me.
They'll be well up for it.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.160
And bring your slave, Goonio.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.720
I know him quite well.
Sort of. His name's Grumio.

07:43.760 --> 07:47.280
And he doesn't have any money. So...
He's good value, though.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.200
What are you doing?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.920
Is that a trick question?

07:58.920 --> 08:00.680
Hello there.
All right?

08:00.720 --> 08:02.880
Hang onto my seeds.
Are they drugs?

08:02.920 --> 08:05.680
They are, yes. Keep the safe, OK?
Where?

08:05.720 --> 08:08.000
Up the arsehole's quite good.
In me pocket.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.640
Pocket's good too.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.600
Follow me!

08:18.160 --> 08:20.360
Open the door, now.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.320
So, gentlemen. Entrez.

08:30.280 --> 08:33.559
OK, go ahead.
Male members of staff

08:33.600 --> 08:37.960
are invited to a stag do to
celebrate the marriage of Aurelius.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.039
Now, Aurelius...
Brackets, the one with the jug.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.360
And the weird beard.
Got him.

08:44.400 --> 08:49.840
Uh, bring lots of cash and get ready
for the night to end all nights.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.200
Ooh, gosh.
Hey, you should come.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.200
Well, I have my mother staying.
But I could leave her for an hour.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.240
What's planned?
Still locking that down.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.680
Because, recently,
for my maiden aunt's 65th birthday,

09:02.720 --> 09:06.960
the whole family did a ghost tour
around the historic parts of Rome.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.320
It was both terrifically
entertaining and informative.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.440
Ye-ah. This is more
of a megalash nightclub crawl.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.480
But thanks anyway.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.600
Yep, so she got the house,
the witch, but I got my freedom.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.640
Both hands on the reins.
And I'm loving it.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.960
I'm sleeping under the stars.
On the streets?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.040
No, in my chariot.
Which is on the street.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.520
But, no, it's great. When I was
married, I was never allowed out.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.880
Now...
You're out.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.000
Exactly. And you get used to
washing in the river.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.880
Checking your blind spot.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.720
And hanging out with young guys
like you is a real tonic.

09:45.760 --> 09:49.680
So, all in all,
I'm having a whale of a time.

09:52.440 --> 09:56.040
I'm going on a stag do tomorrow.
You can probably come.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.920
I love a stag.
I'll have to check.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.680
No, no. I'm very good on a stag.
You won't regret bringing me along.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.880
So you're up for it?
I'm up for everything.

10:03.920 --> 10:07.280
You name it, I'll down it, snort it,
fuck it. Staying in your lane.

10:07.320 --> 10:11.440
- It won't be anything too fancy.
- Hey, staggy, staggy.

10:11.480 --> 10:16.040
Yeah, sort of.
Come on. Staggy, staggy.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.800
- Minding the kerb.
- Staggy, staggy, staggy.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.800
Is this it, then?
No, the guys of work should come.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.000
Who's the middle-aged man
with the bag?

10:35.040 --> 10:38.920
Balbus, my driving instructor.
Driving instructor by day,

10:38.960 --> 10:42.800
lash instructor by night
and the best in the bizzle at both.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.040
Everyone put one of those on.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.320
What are they?
They're little dicks. Dicklets.

10:48.360 --> 10:51.040
Everyone tie one on.
Um... Why?

10:51.080 --> 10:53.720
Because we're the Dickhead Brigade.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.680
Which one's the groom?
I am.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.560
Stick it in your ear.
Dick in your ear, dick in your ear.

11:01.480 --> 11:05.040
This guy's great. Is this guy great?
I'm not sure.

11:05.080 --> 11:09.600
Your missus out on a hen, is she?
Got a face full of cock?

11:09.640 --> 11:12.360
She's with her nurse.
She's got brittle bones.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.320
Too much shagging?
No, it's a congenital condition.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.480
Can she even have sex?
Yeah, I mean... What?

11:19.520 --> 11:21.600
Probably, yeah.
You've not done it yet?

11:21.640 --> 11:24.960
She's always with the nurse.
Most marriages end up without sex.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.680
Yours will start that way too.

11:28.200 --> 11:32.600
Sorry I'm late. Good evening all.
Oh, lovely outfit.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.960
Are there no other office guys?
Sadly not.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.680
There were several redundancies
this week, so no-one's in the mood.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.640
Fucking geeks.
20 into the kitty.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.720
I'm very much ready to eat,
drink and be a bit ribald.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.480
Yeah.
Especially eat.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.320
Chuffing starving over 'ere.
No, we're not eating.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.120
Course not. Eating's cheating.
And expensive.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.400
If we're low on cash,
we can go to Cynthia's.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.920
Shut up. We're not going there.
We just need to be a bit frugal.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.960
Are we downing these, then?
Sipping's fine.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.320
Down in one. Hold onto your dicks.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.000
And we're here.
Here? What happens here?

12:26.040 --> 12:28.880
There's a stripper hiding somewhere,
I can smell it.

12:28.920 --> 12:32.880
Isn't this Servius Tullius?
That's right. Because...

12:32.920 --> 12:37.000
On this spot, King Servius
was murdered by Tarquin.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.320
And they say the wind
that whistles through the portico

12:40.360 --> 12:42.840
sounds like his dying screams.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.120
What's this you're doing?
It's a ghost tour.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.720
What?!
A ghost tour. Oh, great news.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.000
You see?
I don't want to do a ghost tour.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.400
We should be grinding with hotties.
And stuffing our faces.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.040
Just give it a chance.
Servius Tullius is most famous

12:57.080 --> 13:00.160
for his series of tax reforms.
I'll skip this bit.

13:00.560 --> 13:04.000
However, a full three years
after Caesar's murder -

13:04.040 --> 13:07.520
This is rubbish!
Stick with it. A local reported

13:07.560 --> 13:10.360
that, "I was walking past
the senate at the dead of night

13:10.400 --> 13:12.640
and saw a robed figure
covered in blood,

13:12.680 --> 13:17.360
wearing a crown of laurels."
# You don't know what you're doing #

13:17.400 --> 13:20.120
You might learn something.
A small suggestion.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.640
When we did this
for my maiden aunt's 65th,

13:22.680 --> 13:26.240
the guide did lots of voices.
Are we doing something aunts do?

13:26.280 --> 13:29.680
It's getting good. We're about to
look for blood stains.

13:29.720 --> 13:34.360
They'll have cleared them up.
Shh! Everyone look for blood stains.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.560
I'll just have the one.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.680
There aren't any blood stains.
OK, so, carrying on...

13:42.720 --> 13:46.520
Fuck this, I'm sobering up here.
Yes, agreed. Let's move on.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.680
It's just... money-wise...
We could go to the Kitten Club.

13:49.720 --> 13:53.240
Yes, what's that? Let's go there.
It's a bar

13:53.280 --> 13:55.680
where the waitresses dress as cats.
Yes!

13:55.720 --> 13:57.200
No.
Let's skin a cat.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.080
We're not going there.
I'm best man, this is my show,

14:00.120 --> 14:03.000
we are not going.
Then you're sacked. Be my best man?

14:03.040 --> 14:07.840
Sure thing. Let's go.
Yes! Kitty Club, Kitty Club!

14:09.040 --> 14:11.760
I put a lot of effort
into this stag, you know.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.040
I'll just have the two.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.160
Right, let's keep a low profile.
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

14:23.200 --> 14:24.440
OK. Perfect.

14:24.880 --> 14:28.600
Marcus, you came down.
Yeah. I wanted to support you.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.520
Pussy time! Pussy time!

14:30.560 --> 14:34.360
Can you stop chanting, please, mate?
It's a stag do. He's a bit... much.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.920
Oh, well, thanks for coming.
Maybe take the dildos off?

14:38.200 --> 14:40.520
Yeah.
Dildos off! Dildos off!

14:40.880 --> 14:43.160
We won't stay long.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.080
Is that your mate I met at New Year?
Um... No, I don't think so.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.280
Let's get some half-price drinks.
Half-price drinks!

15:33.480 --> 15:36.560
Whoa! The old witch
never used to let me gamble.

15:36.760 --> 15:41.480
Let's make up for lost time.
Too right, kiddo. Let's roll.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.440
It is her.
Think she's still up for it?

15:46.480 --> 15:49.640
What? You're getting married.
Yeah, I know.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.040
And I'll never have sex again.
Drusilla's got brittle bones.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.640
You'll make it work.
It'll be fine, won't it?

15:55.680 --> 15:59.320
Well, I'm no expert. Maybe you could
employ some sort of harness.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.760
See? A harness.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.120
My father should have warned me.
Why?

16:04.160 --> 16:07.520
It was his idea.
He does business with her dad.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.640
It's more tax-efficient
if the families are legally joined.

16:10.680 --> 16:14.120
Very shrewd.
And romantic, in a way.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.200
So, cheers to that.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.400
All of it. Evens.
Hey, whoa! Don't do that.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.960
Really?
Put it on odds.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.160
Odds is better odds, hence the name.
Good call. Everything on odds.

16:32.840 --> 16:36.640
If I win, pay off me debts,
sort me life out. If I lose...

16:36.680 --> 16:38.680
Can't lose.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.920
Come on, you odds.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.360
Oh! Yeah.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.520
No, wait. I need that.

16:48.840 --> 16:52.320
No, no. You can't do this.
My wife's left me, for Jove's sake!

16:52.360 --> 16:55.400
Steady on.
I didn't mean it.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.640
Just give it back!
Can you control him, please?

16:58.680 --> 17:01.040
Sorry.
Oh, you're back, are you?

17:01.080 --> 17:03.720
Couldn't keep away, is that it?
Excuse me?

17:03.760 --> 17:06.319
Aurelius, stop it.
She loves it, mate.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.800
Ah! What the hell are you doing?

17:08.839 --> 17:10.839
Miaow!

17:11.200 --> 17:13.800
Ah! Aaaah!

17:14.040 --> 17:15.480
Oh, my nose.
Sorry.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.160
You hit me.
I'm really sorry.

17:17.200 --> 17:21.000
I'm the stag.
You can't hit the stag!

17:21.040 --> 17:25.079
Cynth, I'm really sorry about that.
I've just been fired because of you.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.160
He was trying to grope you.
I loved that job.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.240
It was a stopgap.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.520
In your heart, you're an actress!
Fuck yourself, Fish Face.

17:33.280 --> 17:37.320
This is your fault.
It was to save us from your tour.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.640
Where is it?

17:46.400 --> 17:49.920
Well, that's what I call a shit stag.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.840
It ain't over yet, kiddo.
We're making a night of this.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.320
Yes. Lead us. I don't think
he's in the right frame of mind.

17:56.360 --> 18:00.560
And I'm sacking you, doing nothing
while the stag's getting decked.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.000
You.
Balbus.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.840
Will you be my best man?
Yes. Finally! Yes, I bloody will.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.120
Well, I'd best be off.
Thank you all for a lovely evening.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.960
You're staying.
I've got to tuck my mother in.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.280
And I'll tuck in your mother if you
leave now. You ain't going nowhere.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.320
Soft cock. You're staying! Oi!

18:20.800 --> 18:24.720
Right. Fix up and look sharp.
You're following me. Where to?

18:24.760 --> 18:27.920
To the wall of glory,
the best-kept secret in Rome.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.760
Up you get, Numb Nuts.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.440
Oi, oi.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.360
Yes! There are spaces.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.440
Pick your hole, then, gents.
Sorry, what is this place?

18:44.480 --> 18:47.240
This is the wall of glory.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.160
Just edge forward and park up.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.960
What? In the hole? Are you serious?
They're clean girls.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.480
I do it all the time.
They won't bite it off.

18:56.520 --> 18:59.000
I'm really not into this.
What? Come on!

18:59.040 --> 19:02.000
Nah. Nor me. I don't put my dick
in a wall as a rule.

19:02.280 --> 19:05.280
Staggy, then?
Oh, I'm not sure.

19:05.320 --> 19:08.640
Once you get hitched
this is all the action you'll get.

19:08.680 --> 19:12.520
Well, I am the stag.
That's it, kiddo.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.480
You're in for a treat. Coins.
Uh...

19:16.600 --> 19:17.720
Come here.
Yeah.

19:17.920 --> 19:22.640
You put your coin in one slot,
you put your boy in the other.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.560
And then you brace yourself.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.760
Ooh! Right. Yes. Mmm.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.560
No. Ah... No.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.200
Sorry, can I...? I don't like it.
I've changed my mind.

19:33.240 --> 19:38.000
No, you don't. We've paid now.
Be as quick as you can, please.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.440
Salve, Grumio.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.960
All right, landlord?
Yeah, I am, actually.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.480
Finally got rid of the rozzers.
Still got my package, I see.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.160
I'll have that back now.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.960
Been helping yourself, then?
You've got a beak.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.840
I'll take that as a yes.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.840
Centurion!
Oi!

20:01.280 --> 20:03.360
Shit sticks!

20:04.880 --> 20:07.280
Get that into your arsehole.
Pocket!

20:07.320 --> 20:09.320
Pocket.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.720
We should go.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.000
Oh, God.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.240
Wait. That can't be it.
Where are the girls?

20:24.600 --> 20:28.080
There are hot girls behind there.
Yeah. I don't think there are.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.920
Argh!

20:29.960 --> 20:32.760
Stop where you are!
Argh!

20:38.840 --> 20:41.480
Shoo! Argh!

20:51.360 --> 20:54.120
Oh. Oh. I feel sick.
Where's Balbus?

20:54.360 --> 20:56.520
I thought he was with us.
Balbus!

20:56.560 --> 20:59.800
I'm going to do it!
Oh! What are you doing now?

20:59.840 --> 21:02.240
I'm gonna bloody jump.
Whoa! Don't jump.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.800
I've got nothing left, kiddo.
The witch has taken everything,

21:05.840 --> 21:09.000
my money, my kids, my house.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.360
And it turns out I've spent
most Friday nights

21:11.400 --> 21:14.160
getting sucked off by old men!

21:14.200 --> 21:16.480
You can't pin that on her.
I'm gonna do it.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.040
Wait! You can't!
Give me one good reason not to.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.240
You haven't taught me
how to reverse yet.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.640
You don't need me. No-one does!
Hey! That's not true.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.120
You're the best in the bizzle.

21:28.280 --> 21:33.160
Learner drivers everywhere need you.
And you're great on a stag.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.840
Isn't he, Marcus?

21:34.880 --> 21:38.760
You? Yes. You're a bloody legend.

21:40.800 --> 21:45.400
I mean, that can't be
all there is, though.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.920
I need more than that.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.640
I'll give you a big bag of drugs.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.320
OK, I'm coming down.
Right.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.720
Good. Let's get him home
before the wedding.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.120
No, it's off.
I'm not getting married.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.880
What?
Not if that's the result.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.040
It doesn't always do this.
This is quite a special case.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.400
I'll tell Dad in the morning.
I don't love her.

22:06.440 --> 22:11.600
I don't want to have sex
in a harness. All this for nothing?

22:17.960 --> 22:21.720
Pretty good stag, all told.
The wedding's been cancelled

22:21.760 --> 22:26.120
and someone tried to kill himself.
I kept having fucked up visions

22:26.160 --> 22:30.960
of chickens everywhere and people
getting noshed off by old men.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.120
Unfortunately,
most of that happened.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.240
Shit. Dead end.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.960
So, do a U-ie.
I've never managed one before.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.640
All right. Let's do this. Tsk, tsk.
