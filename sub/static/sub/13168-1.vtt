WEBVTT

00:24.232 --> 00:27.234
settle down, everybody. Quiet, please.

00:28.319 --> 00:31.447
Mobile phones off, thank you very much.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.366
Okay.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.621
so what is it that makes us what we are?

00:41.416 --> 00:43.542
What is it that defines us?

00:45.670 --> 00:47.212
Is it where we live?

00:48.757 --> 00:50.340
Is it our schooling?

00:52.093 --> 00:53.635
Or is it our family?

00:55.930 --> 00:57.890
Alex Rider. Family?

01:00.769 --> 01:01.894
Alex?

01:04.647 --> 01:05.606
Yes, sir?

01:06.524 --> 01:08.067
Have you prepared something for us?

01:10.528 --> 01:11.236
Yes.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.072
Come on then.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.586
There's not much
I can say about my family.

01:28.671 --> 01:31.381
I didn't know my parents,
they died when I was small.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.259
I live with my uncle.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.640
He's never around so I can't tell you
much about him either.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.643
I have a housekeeper
because he's always away on business.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.145
she's an American and
her name is Jack.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.148
she's always there for me,
which is great because...

01:48.608 --> 01:49.775
he isn't.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.485
My uncle...

01:52.695 --> 01:55.864
he's never gonna set the world on fire
because he's got a real boring Job.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.497
Intruder alert!

02:05.667 --> 02:09.669
His work means a lot to him,
but, he never talks about it.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.847
so where's your uncle now?

02:20.056 --> 02:22.224
At a conference in Cornwall.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.433
"Life in the slow lane."

03:03.808 --> 03:07.519
Whoops-a-daisy! That's the way to do it.

03:08.646 --> 03:09.354
What a pity!

03:23.411 --> 03:27.122
I wish I knew more about my uncle,
but he's not an easy man to pin down.

03:27.957 --> 03:28.665
What the...?!

03:42.889 --> 03:43.889
And that's about it.

03:44.807 --> 03:45.682
The end.

03:46.935 --> 03:47.726
Thank you, Alex.

03:50.855 --> 03:53.565
- Okay, so, if you come round about...
- I really wanna come.

03:53.733 --> 03:54.566
Hey, Sabina.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.526
Alex!

03:56.819 --> 03:58.820
do you wanna do something
this weekend?

04:00.448 --> 04:04.576
I can't, I've riding lessons and
I'm going out with my parents.

04:04.994 --> 04:05.953
It doesn't matter.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.622
Maybe next weekend?

04:09.707 --> 04:10.582
Whatever.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.338
Hey, are you coming home?

04:16.714 --> 04:17.964
Yeah, I'm on my way now.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.091
How was the conference?

04:20.969 --> 04:21.969
It was fine.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.597
- You know how they are.
- No, I don't. You never tell me.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.058
There isn't much to tell. Wait a minute.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.604
Hello? Hello?

04:33.022 --> 04:33.981
Hello?

04:36.484 --> 04:37.776
- What was that?
- Nothing.

04:37.986 --> 04:43.156
I'm sorry I wasn't there last week,
but, this trip came out of nowhere.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.074
As always.

04:45.868 --> 04:50.330
I'll be back in time for dinner, and
then we've got the whole weekend.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.666
- Really?
- When did I ever let you down?

04:52.875 --> 04:54.126
Do you really want me to answer that?

04:55.920 --> 04:58.005
I know. Look, I'll see you soon, okay?

04:58.464 --> 04:59.381
I'm glad you called.

05:00.675 --> 05:01.508
Yeah, me too.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.011
I'll see you later,

05:04.387 --> 05:05.512
Bye.

05:09.017 --> 05:13.061
And then I see you again

05:13.688 --> 05:16.815
And that look is in your eyes

05:16.983 --> 05:21.403
You blew my mind but it wasn't real

05:48.556 --> 05:50.057
You and I

05:51.059 --> 05:56.021
We're floating in a kaleidoscope of lies

05:58.941 --> 06:01.568
Tell me why

06:02.820 --> 06:08.200
You dress the truth in a velvet disguise

06:10.078 --> 06:13.872
I wanna break free

06:15.291 --> 06:18.960
You can never shake what I believe

06:23.299 --> 06:28.220
And the sunrise paints
the skies red in shame

06:29.597 --> 06:36.395
And you wake up to find the whole
world's gone insane

06:36.562 --> 06:40.565
But if you hide yourself away Well I say

06:40.775 --> 06:45.904
Hey, you've only got yourself to blame

06:50.618 --> 06:52.285
Gotta decide

06:54.080 --> 06:59.418
Whether or not you believe all those lies.

07:01.462 --> 07:05.132
But take it from me

07:06.467 --> 07:11.304
They've got a strangle hold on
the air we breathe

07:14.892 --> 07:19.521
And the sunrise burns
the sky red in shame.

07:20.898 --> 07:27.237
And you wake up to find the whole
world's gone insane

07:27.530 --> 07:31.450
But if you hide yourself away
Well I say

07:34.245 --> 07:46.548
Jack?

07:50.511 --> 07:51.636
Jack, are you here?

08:04.775 --> 08:05.567
Oh, Jack.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.571
Good day at school?

08:10.281 --> 08:11.948
Why are we speaking Japanese?

08:12.241 --> 08:14.993
We're having a special dinner.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.411
sushi.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.376
Arigatou.

08:24.086 --> 08:24.961
Let's begin.

08:28.758 --> 08:33.135
I met the most amazing guy
at the fish market today.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.514
Do you know what the problem with
this country is?

08:35.806 --> 08:38.558
Every good-looking guy is either
gay or married.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.309
Except for you, but you're too young.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.814
Will you please eat something?

08:45.900 --> 08:48.318
He's coming. He's just stuck in traffic.

08:48.569 --> 08:49.694
He would have rung.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.739
He's probably gone to the office
and the next thing we know,

08:53.032 --> 08:54.407
he's going to Hong Kong.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.284
Let me down again.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.789
- You know his work means a lot to him.
- Yeah, it means a lot.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.833
All the more for us.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.546
What did I tell you? Who's a genius?

09:54.176 --> 09:54.968
Come on.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.607
We are gathered here today...

10:08.983 --> 10:12.611
to bid farewell to a man called

10:13.404 --> 10:16.281
A reminder that even in the midst of life...

10:16.741 --> 10:19.367
we are all of us walking together...

10:20.202 --> 10:21.911
in the shadow of death.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.664
Ian Rider was a good man.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.543
Everyone who worked with him will
remember him for his courage...

10:29.253 --> 10:30.503
and his loyalty.

10:31.380 --> 10:35.759
He was, above all, a true patriot.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.511
We have entrusted our brother
to God's mercy...

10:39.013 --> 10:41.806
and we now commit his body
to the ground.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.018
Earth to earth.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.145
Ashes to ashes.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.522
Dust to dust.

10:49.774 --> 10:53.234
Ian Rider, a true patriot.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.779
True patriot.

11:12.421 --> 11:15.340
To Him, be glory forever.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.008
Amen.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.067
I'm John Crawford from
the Royal and General Bank.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.569
I just want you to know,
you have our condolences.

11:37.446 --> 11:41.741
It's a tragedy. A car crash.
If only he had been wearing a seatbelt.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.368
Thank you.

11:43.577 --> 11:47.080
This is Alan Blunt.
He's the Chairman of the Bank.

11:47.498 --> 11:48.456
Alex.

11:48.874 --> 11:53.211
sorry about your uncle.
We're going to miss him.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.922
- He talked a lot about you.
- That's strange.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.174
Because he never mentioned you.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.931
his is my deputy, Mrs Jones.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.351
I'll be in contact very soon, Alex.

12:09.061 --> 12:09.894
Why?

12:10.354 --> 12:14.524
After what's happened, the question
of who's going to look after you.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.068
- I'll look after him.
- We're just trying to help.

12:20.489 --> 12:24.367
I'm sure we'll meet again,
Hopefully, somewhere a little less

12:25.327 --> 12:26.244
gloomy.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.373
My uncle always wore a seatbelt,
Mr Blunt.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.922
- He was a very careful man.
- Not careful enough.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.012
Did you mean what you said about
looking after me?

12:44.513 --> 12:46.264
Of course I did, idiot.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.975
You know I would never leave you.
Yeah.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.643
Besides, who else is there?

12:51.145 --> 12:54.689
I mean, will you be allowed to?
We are not even related.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.568
how much more related
do you wanna be?

12:59.028 --> 13:01.529
Is it just me,
or were those bankers weird?

13:06.368 --> 13:08.661
I've been doing this all day!

13:09.038 --> 13:10.288
What the heck are you doing?!

13:11.373 --> 13:12.415
Alex?

13:15.044 --> 13:17.879
Alex!

13:59.421 --> 14:00.380
Idiot!

14:05.344 --> 14:06.261
Get out of it!

14:19.775 --> 14:20.859
What are you playing at?!

14:39.962 --> 14:43.756
I predict a riot

14:54.393 --> 14:56.519
If you see that Nigel,
you tell him I want him, all right?

15:25.382 --> 15:27.800
What's going on?!

15:29.511 --> 15:33.222
The Rider car should have been done
two days ago! so do it now, all right?!

15:33.432 --> 15:35.975
- I didn't get the paperwork!
- Just do it, Harry!

15:37.227 --> 15:41.064
- I'm going to Liverpool street.
- Liverpool street? What, the station?

15:42.524 --> 15:46.027
Yes, you berk! Where else?
I'm gonna take them the stuff.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.614
Bryce? Bryce?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.171
Tyson, get down!

16:08.008 --> 16:08.758
What?

17:15.534 --> 17:16.159
Harry!

17:29.840 --> 17:30.840
Come here!

17:31.133 --> 17:31.966
There he goes!

18:31.026 --> 18:31.859
Close in.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.779
How did he get in?
Get out the way!

18:43.664 --> 18:46.666
sure they said they were coming here?
They could have gone have gone anywhere.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.128
They're not taking the train,
they're bringing stuff to the station.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.421
- Where? - I don't know.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.510
- Jack. - What?

18:58.387 --> 18:59.345
Over there.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.182
It's that guy from the funeral.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.310
What's his name?

19:07.396 --> 19:08.354
Alex?

19:20.450 --> 19:24.412
The stormbreaker. Coming soon from
Sayle Enterprises.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.080
- Look out. - sorry.

19:45.058 --> 19:48.936
The stormbreaker.
Coming soon from Sayle Enterprises.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.215
Welcome to Arrivals.

20:59.591 --> 21:03.511
Please remain seated and
await docking procedure.

21:12.980 --> 21:13.938
Good morning.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.863
Good morning,
Alex. shouldn't you be at school?

21:24.283 --> 21:26.158
I was at Liverpool street station.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.577
And now I'm here.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.246
That's right.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.002
Morning.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.465
so what is this place? Hogwarts?

21:42.175 --> 21:45.428
I think you've probably realised,
your uncle didn't work for a bank.

21:45.595 --> 21:48.514
The Royal and General doesn't exist.
He worked for us.

21:48.849 --> 21:49.807
Who are you?

21:50.434 --> 21:54.854
My name is Mrs Jones. I run the
special Operation Division of M16.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.106
Wait a minute,
are you saying he lied to me?

21:57.316 --> 22:00.359
He lied to everyone.
sorry. Part of his job.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.241
Ian Rider was one of our best agents.
Until you got him killed.

22:07.451 --> 22:11.620
He got himself killed.
It's an occupational hazard, I'm afraid.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.958
- Not if you're a banker.
- Mr Blunt wants to talk to you.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.878
We have a proposition
we'd like to make.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.557
We want you to work for us.

22:34.478 --> 22:38.064
- You're not being serious?
- It's not my habit to make jokes

22:38.565 --> 22:39.774
Well, you're making one now.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.195
I don't wanna be a spy. In case
you haven't noticed, I'm still at school.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.280
I'll take that as a 'no', then.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.741
What a great shame.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.578
Your uncle would be very disappointed.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.663
- What? - Letting him down like that.

22:54.915 --> 22:58.250
But then, I suppose, young people...

22:58.502 --> 22:59.919
How can you say that?

23:00.212 --> 23:04.048
He wouldn't want me here. He spent his
life making sure I didn't know about this.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.257
Really?

23:06.051 --> 23:08.677
Then how do you explain ...

23:10.764 --> 23:11.597
this?

23:16.103 --> 23:17.937
First-rate martial arts moves.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.564
Perfectly executed. Who trained you?

23:20.774 --> 23:24.443
- Nobody trained me.
- You're a black belt at karate.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.029
Who paid for the lessons?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.948
- It was my choice. - No!

23:31.118 --> 23:33.911
All your life, Ian Rider was preparing you.

23:34.121 --> 23:37.915
You speak French,
German and Japanese.

23:38.208 --> 23:42.503
He took me on holiday. You've been
scuba diving, mountain climbing ...

23:42.754 --> 23:45.881
abseiling, white water rafting
They were my hobbies.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.509
rifle shooting, martial arts.

23:51.179 --> 23:52.763
He was training you.

23:53.598 --> 23:57.059
That's not how it was.
You're trying to spoil everything.

23:58.645 --> 24:01.230
Please put me back in the photo booth
and show me the way out.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.151
I'm surprised, really.

24:05.485 --> 24:09.155
I thought you'd want to
get back at your uncle's killers.

24:11.408 --> 24:17.121
How's that housekeeper of yours?
What's her name? Jack Starbright.

24:17.330 --> 24:19.707
I suppose she'll have started
packing by now.

24:20.333 --> 24:23.043
- Why? What do you mean?
- Didn't she tell you?

24:23.253 --> 24:27.298
Her visa ran out seven years ago.
she'll be deported any day now.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.343
Actually, we might prosecute her first.

24:32.345 --> 24:33.512
Make an example.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.475
Working here illegally,
may mean a prison sentence.

24:38.685 --> 24:39.768
What are you?

24:41.188 --> 24:42.897
What kind of people are you?

24:43.899 --> 24:47.485
Ones that normally get their way.

24:47.861 --> 24:51.322
Liverpool street concourse now ready
for departure.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.132
stop flaking at the back.
Get a move on!

25:10.467 --> 25:11.634
Get up there!

25:11.927 --> 25:12.718
Get moving!

25:12.886 --> 25:15.513
Come on then, lad, look lively.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.559
On your feet.

25:21.561 --> 25:24.730
Gentlemen, this is our latest recruit.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.566
He's here for two weeks' training.

25:27.943 --> 25:31.111
Don't ask me about it,
because I don't know a thing.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.072
Ijust do as I'm told.

25:33.907 --> 25:37.743
We have no names here.
We have no ranks.

25:38.245 --> 25:44.208
This is 'K' Unit. Fox, Bear,
Eagle and Wolf.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.378
You'll be Cub. Get him a bed.

25:53.802 --> 25:57.346
- What the heck is this?
- It's a kid.

25:58.515 --> 26:02.017
Who the heck do you think you are?
A schoolboy?

26:02.561 --> 26:03.811
They've gotta be joking.

26:05.855 --> 26:06.897
what's your name?

26:07.732 --> 26:08.941
Who sent you here?!

26:09.568 --> 26:10.442
I can't tell you.

26:11.611 --> 26:12.611
He can't tell me.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.407
Course you can.
You must be with special Operations.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.784
They're the only ones stupid enough
to come up with something like this.

26:18.994 --> 26:19.660
I said...

26:24.833 --> 26:25.916
I can't tell you.

26:26.501 --> 26:29.420
That's very good. someone been
teaching you self-defense?

26:30.880 --> 26:32.298
Ain't gonna help you here.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.634
No pain, no gain. Move it!

26:35.844 --> 26:37.177
You ain't gonna last two days.

26:41.516 --> 26:42.891
Get a move on, schoolboy!

26:44.686 --> 26:46.270
Keep moving, Cub!

26:50.108 --> 26:53.652
DAY 4
Get up, you! stay with it.

26:59.492 --> 27:03.996
DAY 7 That's it, one in front
of the other. Hurry up.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.999
Come on, get up!

27:07.334 --> 27:10.836
Move it, Cub! Come on!

27:11.504 --> 27:13.130
DAY 9 Come on!

27:13.506 --> 27:15.883
Come on, go! Go on, go, go, go!

27:17.177 --> 27:18.469
That's it, Cub, go on.

27:20.013 --> 27:22.348
And all I wanna hear
is the message beep

27:24.768 --> 27:25.351
And stop.

27:27.687 --> 27:30.689
Look at him. Come on, Cub.

27:31.691 --> 27:34.818
You're not in the playground now,
Cub. Move it!

27:35.904 --> 27:37.279
Come on, hurry up.

27:39.699 --> 27:40.658
Idiot!

27:41.618 --> 27:44.453
Love forever, love is free

27:44.663 --> 27:48.040
Let's turn forever, you and me

27:48.208 --> 27:50.959
Windmill, windmill for the land

27:51.294 --> 27:56.173
Is everybody in?

28:11.189 --> 28:13.607
'K' Unit, stand fast.

28:13.983 --> 28:16.735
You have failed the exercise.

28:17.737 --> 28:18.153
What an idiot.

28:18.321 --> 28:21.240
Well, well, well. What have we got here?

28:22.117 --> 28:23.450
You idiot, Wolf.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.372
We're finished!

28:28.581 --> 28:31.083
We've blown the whole exercise.
We'll get kicked out!

28:32.252 --> 28:34.294
This is your fault. You had the map.

28:36.339 --> 28:38.257
Never listens. He's always gotta be right.

28:38.508 --> 28:41.885
Who puts a light on in the middle of
an exercise? Unbelievable.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.349
- There's a fireplace.
- How did you know?

28:47.684 --> 28:50.352
- I saw the chimney on the way in.
- The kid's right.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.104
It's clear.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.733
You think they would leave it open
if they thought we could all climb up?

28:55.942 --> 28:57.234
You can't, you're too big.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.570
But I can.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.906
Go on then, Cub, up you go.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.594
All right, mate? Cup of tea?

29:23.803 --> 29:25.179
Oh, yeah, thanks.

29:25.722 --> 29:29.141
- We should take that lot back to base.
- No, later'll be fine.

29:29.976 --> 29:30.726
see ya.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.520
Fancy a nice cup of tea, boys?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.606
shut up, sit down.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.012
What's that lot playing at,
having a kid with them?

30:07.305 --> 30:10.516
Dunno. He looks like a schoolboy.
He can only be about 14.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.601
That's a bit young for
special Forces, isn't it?

30:12.936 --> 30:15.145
We'd better get him back to his mummy.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.481
Yeah, he probably needs a nappy change.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.609
Must be his bedtime. Time for his hot milk.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.945
Boss? Are we moving?

30:23.613 --> 30:25.322
Hold on, lad!

30:25.532 --> 30:28.826
- Hold on, fellas! - Jump out!

30:41.881 --> 30:44.675
Cuts. Bruises. Fractured limbs.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.969
It's a miracle no-one was killed.

30:47.178 --> 30:51.473
I'm very sorry, Major.
We will be talking to our man -- Boy.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.976
He's no child, Mr Blunt.

30:55.478 --> 30:56.854
He's a lethal weapon.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.234
He's ready.

31:20.670 --> 31:21.962
Heard you were leaving.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.048
Yeah, that's right.

31:26.759 --> 31:28.051
What you did earlier...

31:29.596 --> 31:31.013
if it weren't for you...

31:35.977 --> 31:36.894
Here you are.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.124
And finally, an amazing gift made to
the British nation.

31:59.334 --> 32:04.421
The stormbreaker is the most
sophisticated PC of the 21st century...

32:04.631 --> 32:08.342
and one month ago, its multi-
billionaire inventor, Darrius sayle...

32:08.551 --> 32:10.594
made his astonishing announcement.

32:10.887 --> 32:14.598
I'm gonna give a stormbreaker to
every school in the country.

32:16.309 --> 32:19.978
And while I'm at it,
I wouldn't mind giving you one, too.

32:20.313 --> 32:21.647
Really, Mr Sayle!

32:23.483 --> 32:25.442
- We don't trust him.
- Why not?

32:25.818 --> 32:29.154
Well, we don't trust anyone.
It's sort of what we do.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.865
We always thought that
Sayle was too good to be true

32:32.075 --> 32:35.494
so, six months ago,
we sent an agent to watch him.

32:35.703 --> 32:37.329
- Are you talking about my uncle?
- Yes

32:37.622 --> 32:40.999
Sayle has a manufacturing plant in
Cornwall.

32:41.209 --> 32:44.294
It's built on top of what used to be
a tin mine.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.339
Ian Rider went there as a security guard.

32:47.799 --> 32:52.386
He sent us these images of the old mine
entrance just outside Sayle's complex.

32:52.804 --> 32:57.015
- His last message mentioned a virus.
- A computer virus?

32:57.225 --> 32:59.935
He was on his way to tell us,
but he never arrived.

33:00.186 --> 33:03.105
We need to get someone in there to
take a look...

33:03.523 --> 33:05.524
and this may be our last chance.

33:05.733 --> 33:06.483
Why me?

33:07.694 --> 33:08.652
I'll show you.

33:10.697 --> 33:13.115
This is Kevin Blake.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.492
He's a computer nerd.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.829
six weeks ago he won a competition
in a computer magazine.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.289
Disc Drive World'. Do you ever read it?

33:21.582 --> 33:22.332
No.

33:22.792 --> 33:26.670
The first prize was a visit to
Cornwall to try out the stormbreaker.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.715
- He's due to arrive tomorrow.
- It's a PR stunt.

33:29.882 --> 33:33.385
I imagine Mr Sayle is trying to show
the world that he's a nice man.

33:33.636 --> 33:39.266
Get a kiddy in to look at the works.
Now you will take his place.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.019
Yeah, but I look nothing like him.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.523
We've spoken to the editor.

33:48.901 --> 33:50.152
There's just one problem.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.740
I know nothing about computers,
and I'm not a computer nerd.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.658
But you soon will be.

33:58.286 --> 34:02.581
There's only two days left. There's a
launch at the science Museum on Friday.

34:02.790 --> 34:06.168
70, 000 stormbreaker computers
going live.

34:06.461 --> 34:10.172
Just take a look around.
But be careful of sayle.

34:10.630 --> 34:13.507
He may seem charming...
But he's about as charming...

34:15.261 --> 34:16.844
as a snake.

34:17.263 --> 34:19.973
Just keep your eyes open
and report back.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.766
How do I do that?

34:22.101 --> 34:25.437
We will give you
a telecommunications device.

34:25.772 --> 34:28.565
That, and other gadgets.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.025
I get gadgets?

34:44.081 --> 34:45.998
Come up and see the Robopets range.
Up on the third floor.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.627
- I want one!
- Yes, thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.420
- I want one! - Thank you.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.422
You're so mean. Not fair.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.509
And I suppose you want one as well,
do you?

34:55.717 --> 34:58.595
No, I'm looking for something to
take to Cornwall.

35:00.765 --> 35:01.932
To Cornwall?

35:04.185 --> 35:05.268
Follow me.

35:10.858 --> 35:12.818
Andrea Chicken to floor three, please.
Thank you.

35:13.152 --> 35:15.070
I keep my special toys down here...

35:15.279 --> 35:19.658
where children aren't allowed,
it rather pleases me to say.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.870
Right, we'll start with this.

35:25.206 --> 35:28.500
A yo-yo? Bit of a grandpa's toy,
don't you think?

35:28.709 --> 35:33.547
And your grandpa's yo-yo had a miniaturized
engine with traction of up to 90 pounds ...

35:33.798 --> 35:38.468
all in a magnetized housing with
a cord of super-nylon, did it?

35:38.719 --> 35:40.053
- No.
- Batteries included?

35:40.304 --> 35:42.180
- No.
- No, I think not.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.683
Now, here's something for you to
keep it in.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.977
- What about this? - Don't pull that!

35:47.270 --> 35:50.105
You'll deploy the parachute.
A parachute?

35:50.690 --> 35:53.525
This is rather appropriate for you,

35:55.444 --> 35:56.987
- Zit cream?
- Put some on your finger.

35:57.280 --> 36:02.242
Perfectly harmless,
pleasantly fragranced. But...

36:02.535 --> 36:05.370
apply it to anything metallic, and ...

36:10.376 --> 36:14.296
It'll work its way through up to
six inches of carbonized steel.

36:16.007 --> 36:21.136
This is called a fountain pen.
Not something you have much use for,

36:21.387 --> 36:24.181
the nib can be fired from
a range of up to eight meters.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.057
The ink is sodium pentathlon.

36:26.350 --> 36:30.729
Whomever you hit will do exactly what
you want for up to six hours.

36:30.938 --> 36:32.981
- six hours? - six hours.

36:33.649 --> 36:36.860
I've saved the best till last.
It's over here.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.865
- Don't do that.
- Why, is it dangerous?

36:42.074 --> 36:43.783
No, it's very annoying.

36:47.246 --> 36:51.166
A specially modified
Nintendo Ds games system.

36:51.375 --> 36:54.586
What it does depends on
the cartridges you insert.

36:54.754 --> 36:58.340
With this one,
it's a PDA, a scanner and transmitter.

36:58.633 --> 37:01.092
It's to contact us,
assuming you can be bothered.

37:01.427 --> 37:06.389
This one here turns it into
a bug-finder and sonic intensifier.

37:06.599 --> 37:10.227
You can hear conversations through
solid walls for up to 250 yards.

37:10.478 --> 37:14.773
This turns the device into a smoke
bomb. There's a five second delay.

37:14.982 --> 37:18.318
That's really cool. And what about
'Mariokart'?

37:19.278 --> 37:22.197
It's a game. We thought you might
like it for the flight.

37:28.079 --> 37:31.289
May we remind you to keep your
baggage with you at all times.

37:38.381 --> 37:41.800
Miss Vole? I'm the editor of 'Disc
Drive World'.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.177
- Then this must be Kevin.
- That's me.

37:44.387 --> 37:48.473
- You should say goodbye now.
- Well, goodbye, Kevin.

37:48.849 --> 37:51.768
I hope you find your
stay most informative.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.311
I'm sure it will be.

38:02.154 --> 38:07.033
I am Nadia Vole. I work for Mr Sayle.
Press and public relations.

38:07.326 --> 38:08.159
A PR?

38:10.037 --> 38:11.955
It is a very important job.

38:13.082 --> 38:16.918
This is Port Tallon. A fishing village.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.045
Not if you're a fish.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.192
Heard you were ill wish you better Sabina

39:51.097 --> 39:52.097
Hey.

39:52.973 --> 39:54.140
How are you?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.268
That's pretty cool, don't you think?

39:57.436 --> 39:59.104
I'm not sure I'd want one as a pet.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.731
Physalia Physalia.

40:02.149 --> 40:04.234
That's the Portuguese Man Of War.

40:05.194 --> 40:08.071
I got that beauty in the south China sea.

40:08.739 --> 40:13.451
I'm happy killing exotic animals,
but not this one. I had to keep it.

40:13.619 --> 40:18.581
she sort of reminds me of myself.
99 percent water, no brains and no anus.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.920
You know, I think I'm gonna get to
like you.

40:25.506 --> 40:28.466
You know why I love her?
I love her because...

40:29.468 --> 40:31.136
she's an outsider.

40:31.512 --> 40:35.515
she's silent and deadly.
And if you came into contact with that...

40:36.058 --> 40:38.726
you'd die a very memorable death.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.478
I'm too young to die.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.649
You're never too young to die.

40:48.279 --> 40:52.490
Excuse me. Mr sayle, you have the
American Ambassador on the line.

40:55.077 --> 40:57.871
Mr Ambassador. How are you doing?

40:58.622 --> 41:00.498
The answer is still no.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.794
I'll tell him myself and I'll do it right now.

41:05.337 --> 41:07.589
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be able to...

41:08.340 --> 41:12.177
join you for lunch, but I'm
looking forward to seeing you at dinner.

41:12.887 --> 41:16.347
It's been quite a while since I've been
face-to-face with a British schoolboy.

41:16.849 --> 41:20.101
I'm eager to hear what you think
about the stormbreaker.

41:20.102 --> 41:22.061
I'm looking forward to it,

41:24.190 --> 41:25.815
This is Mr Grin.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.234
seems he's cut himself shaving.

41:29.403 --> 41:32.572
Mr Grin used to be
a novelty act in a circus.

41:32.781 --> 41:35.158
He used to catch
a spinning knife in his teeth.

41:36.452 --> 41:37.035
And?

41:37.328 --> 41:40.830
He lost his concentration when
his mother waved to him in the audience.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.292
You take care of my boy.
I'll see you later.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.743
Are you settled in, Kevin?

42:19.578 --> 42:20.745
Yes, thank you.

42:21.580 --> 42:25.583
It is time for you to see the stormbreaker.

42:32.675 --> 42:36.094
You are the first child to experience
the power...

42:36.345 --> 42:38.763
the world domination of
the stormbreaker.

42:38.973 --> 42:44.686
This model is pre-loaded with highly
developed programs for the school curricula.

42:44.979 --> 42:45.937
Please.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.231
Does it have pinball?

42:48.899 --> 42:50.692
There is no pinballs!

42:51.485 --> 42:53.778
Please, be still while it scans you.

42:56.115 --> 42:57.740
scanning commencing.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.704
Please stand still.

43:02.955 --> 43:05.707
I see you're using a slice matrix
virtual reality software.

43:05.916 --> 43:09.877
Yes. Who taught you about computers,
- My uncle.

43:10.129 --> 43:14.090
- He is a computer whiz-king?
- No. He was a security guard.

43:15.092 --> 43:16.217
But he died.

43:16.969 --> 43:19.679
- And how did that happen?
- I'm not sure.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.723
But I'll find out.

43:23.601 --> 43:27.020
Maybe. But not today.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.898
scanning complete.

43:31.358 --> 43:36.237
Please put on the glasses. Choose
a subject and press 'enter' to begin.

43:36.488 --> 43:39.657
I will return later. Enjoy.

43:43.954 --> 43:46.831
Place your hands on the pads.

43:53.172 --> 43:57.383
Use your fingers to navigate.
select 'category'.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.053
You have selected 'space'.

44:01.055 --> 44:02.889
Press thumb key to begin.

44:12.316 --> 44:14.776
There is no gravity in outer space.

44:15.694 --> 44:19.072
The large magellanic cloud is an
irregular galaxy...

44:19.323 --> 44:21.658
measuring 30, 000 light years across.

44:22.618 --> 44:25.536
160, 000 light years away from Earth.

44:25.788 --> 44:26.746
Illegal interface.

44:33.671 --> 44:34.879
Where is he now?

44:35.130 --> 44:39.217
- Can't tell you. sorry.
- What are you sorry about, sweetie?

44:39.426 --> 44:44.097
Taking him out of school or trying to
turn him into some kind of spy?

44:44.306 --> 44:47.725
Alex isn't a spy.
He's a 14 year old kid, lady!

44:47.935 --> 44:50.019
Well, that's what makes him useful to us.

44:50.896 --> 44:52.730
And what happens if he gets hurt?

44:53.232 --> 44:56.859
What if he's killed?
Could you live with that, Mrs Jones?

44:57.945 --> 45:01.781
I worked for Ian Rider nine years.
I didn't know about any of this.

45:02.074 --> 45:04.534
- if anything happens to Alex ...
- It won't.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.412
We'll take care of him, I promise.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.580
By the way, he...

45:10.416 --> 45:14.794
wanted me to give you this.
It's your visa, it's permanent.

45:25.597 --> 45:29.434
Dinosaur.
The name means 'terrible lizard'

45:30.561 --> 45:35.648
160 million years ago these creatures
first roamed the Earth.

45:36.608 --> 45:40.027
The largest carnivorous dinosaur was
the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

45:40.946 --> 45:44.031
Each one of its teeth was 15
centimetres long.

46:14.271 --> 46:17.398
Good afternoon, Mr sayle, we've been
expecting you.

46:17.900 --> 46:21.235
We've prepared a demonstration for
your approval.

46:21.779 --> 46:25.740
- Is it ready for me?
- Yes, sir. This way, please.

46:38.670 --> 46:42.173
Kevin?

46:55.687 --> 46:59.148
Here it is, sir. I do hope this
satisfies your requirements.

47:02.820 --> 47:06.280
This is a scale model of the rooftop
at your London HQ.

47:15.707 --> 47:18.918
I've incorporated a powerful
nationwide transmitter...

47:19.169 --> 47:21.671
that will give you manual override.

47:21.880 --> 47:23.965
... a back-up system.

47:25.050 --> 47:29.512
This system will send out a signal
that will activate...

47:29.721 --> 47:31.639
all 70, 000 computers.

47:31.849 --> 47:35.351
Of course, it shouldn't be needed.
Is it all right, sir?

47:35.644 --> 47:36.561
excellent.

47:41.733 --> 47:42.817
It's very good.

48:19.730 --> 48:22.982
Warning. R-5 injection now in progress.

48:27.404 --> 48:29.196
What are you doing down here, Kevin?

48:29.907 --> 48:32.450
I was just wondering where this went,
Miss Vole.

48:33.952 --> 48:37.246
- What is that place?
- This area is restricted

48:37.456 --> 48:38.623
This way, please.

48:40.542 --> 48:41.292
Okay.

48:50.177 --> 48:52.136
You know, I was brought up on the...

48:53.472 --> 48:56.515
on the wrong side of the tracks
in a very dark

48:56.934 --> 49:00.811
It was terrible. It was very nasty.
I still have the nightmares.

49:01.647 --> 49:04.482
- What happened?
- I was lucky. I got out.

49:04.733 --> 49:07.526
My mother won a million dollars on
the state lottery.

49:07.736 --> 49:12.198
she had me educated in the best
schooling system in the world in your country.

49:13.617 --> 49:15.993
- You were at school with the Prime
- That's right.

49:16.286 --> 49:20.623
And he treated me with the same
kindness as all the others in my class.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.694
This is the number, Miss Vole.

49:49.903 --> 49:52.989
And this phone is registered to
an address in Chelsea.

49:58.537 --> 49:59.495
so, tell me...

50:00.038 --> 50:01.497
Do you like the stormbreaker?

50:02.290 --> 50:03.541
Yeah, it was cool.

50:04.418 --> 50:07.962
Cool? Come on, man, is that all you
can say?

50:10.048 --> 50:14.260
It strikes me that you don't talk very much.
You're the strong, silent type.

50:14.469 --> 50:16.971
You don't even seem like
a computer enthusiast.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.181
And you don't look like one either.

50:22.060 --> 50:23.519
That's funny, Mr sayle...

50:25.355 --> 50:27.231
because I think I'd say the same

50:28.984 --> 50:30.526
You got a point, son.

50:30.736 --> 50:33.571
Listen, I very much enjoyed meeting you.

50:34.031 --> 50:37.616
And I'm sure you'll have a lot to
talk about when you get back to school.

50:38.076 --> 50:40.536
And when we launch
the stormbreakers tomorrow...

50:41.747 --> 50:43.831
I'll be thinking particularly of you.

50:44.249 --> 50:46.751
Enjoy the grub.

50:56.094 --> 50:58.095
Do not let the spines puncture your skin.

50:58.388 --> 51:02.266
It can result in vomiting,
fever or even death.

51:02.768 --> 51:07.605
They're a great delicacy in Japanese restaurants.
The Fugu fish is one of the ...

51:10.275 --> 51:14.570
Excuse me,
I am looking for a person called Jack.

51:15.781 --> 51:19.241
- Is this about Alex?
- You are friend of Alex?

51:19.451 --> 51:23.079
- sort of. I look after him.
- This is Alex.

51:23.455 --> 51:25.623
- so?
- And this man with him?

51:25.874 --> 51:28.584
- His father?
- What is going on?

51:28.877 --> 51:31.796
Tell me, who is this boy?
What is he doing?

51:32.005 --> 51:34.340
- Who are you?
- Who is he working for?

51:34.508 --> 51:35.424
Wait!

51:52.818 --> 51:54.110
Now I feel like breaking laws

51:54.694 --> 51:57.196
Go on start a civil war

51:57.489 --> 52:00.116
Here's my fist, where's the fight?

52:00.367 --> 52:02.326
Your world's collapsing tonight

52:02.702 --> 52:04.453
I wanna make some noise

52:04.788 --> 52:05.663
I wanna drop some bombs

52:06.039 --> 52:08.833
I wanna make some noise

52:09.167 --> 52:16.006
You tell me what can go wrong

52:21.847 --> 52:24.306
Now I feel like dropping bombs

52:24.474 --> 52:26.809
Black out your house if you're at home

52:27.185 --> 52:29.854
Hurt but healed still coming on

52:30.147 --> 52:32.189
In the mess where I'm from

52:32.357 --> 52:35.317
I wanna make some noise

52:35.610 --> 52:38.028
I wanna drop some bombs

52:38.280 --> 52:41.323
I wanna make some noise

52:41.700 --> 52:47.496
You tell me what can go wrong

52:50.000 --> 52:50.791
Goodnight.

54:40.986 --> 54:43.988
Mr Gregorovich. I'm glad you can join us.

54:45.156 --> 54:49.118
I didn't know you were gonna
come in person. This is the last batch.

54:49.327 --> 54:53.706
My people wanted assurance that
the operation went according to plan.

54:55.083 --> 55:00.087
It's my plan, my operation. Why would
they think anything could go wrong?

55:02.674 --> 55:04.174
You stupid idiot!

55:10.015 --> 55:10.848
It's okay.

55:12.350 --> 55:14.476
The container is not compromised.

55:15.645 --> 55:16.645
sorry.

55:16.855 --> 55:17.980
I won't do that again.

55:19.441 --> 55:20.357
No.

55:20.984 --> 55:21.900
You won't.

55:27.073 --> 55:28.866
My people don't like mistakes.

55:29.534 --> 55:32.703
Well, I haven't got all night. Let's
go to work, boys.

55:33.079 --> 55:34.913
Back to work! All of you!

55:43.298 --> 55:44.715
This just came from Alex Rider.

55:44.883 --> 55:47.426
- Yassen Gregorovich.
- It has to be.

55:47.886 --> 55:49.720
I thought he was still in North Korea.

55:49.929 --> 55:53.015
Obviously not. This is the proof you need.

55:53.475 --> 55:56.393
The stormbreaker launch is in less than
24 hours. Cancel it.

55:56.561 --> 56:00.856
Yes, you're right. For once.
I'll put a call into Downing street.

56:01.358 --> 56:02.232
Get Alex out.

56:02.400 --> 56:04.735
There's no need.
He'll be on a plane tomorrow.

56:04.986 --> 56:07.613
You can meet him, if you like. Take
him for an ice-cream.

56:08.615 --> 56:11.992
Well, he's done very well.
He deserves a treat.

56:16.456 --> 56:17.748
Alex Rider.

56:18.208 --> 56:20.417
I suspected him from
the moment he arrived.

56:20.668 --> 56:24.880
And his uncle was Ian Rider,
the security guard that was actually a spy.

56:27.175 --> 56:29.134
I want you to go to his room...

56:29.636 --> 56:32.471
I want you to wake him up, gently ...

56:33.848 --> 56:35.265
then I want you to kill him.

58:03.021 --> 58:03.854
You've gotta be kidding me.

58:40.558 --> 59:29.523
Warning. R-5 injection now in progress.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.140
What are you doing here?

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:09.521
- Who are you?
- I'm Kevin Blake. I was invited here.

01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:13.108
It's a good act. You do it very well.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:17.487
- But you should not have come here.
- We can talk.

01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:19.906
I don't think so.

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.084
Yes, we can.

01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:34.504
Don't drop that.

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:40.135
R-5. What is it?

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:42.512
Put it back.

01:01:01.949 --> 01:01:03.033
The way out.

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:05.577
Now.

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:38.420
Going somewhere?

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:40.714
Kevin?

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:10.368
If this is how you treat the winner,
I'd hate to see what happened to the runner-up.

01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:13.497
You're not Kevin Blake.
You're Alex Rider.

01:03:13.664 --> 01:03:19.127
Your uncle pretended to be a security man.
Yassen Gregorovich dealt with him.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:23.882
That's right.
And MI6 sent you to take his place?

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:28.637
shame on those people, sending
a 14 year old boy to do their dirty work.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:32.349
Not very British, Not very cricket.

01:03:33.017 --> 01:03:36.228
What are you doing here? Why are you
putting a virus into the stormbreaker?

01:03:42.568 --> 01:03:44.569
it's not a computer virus.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.699
It's the real thing.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:54.454
It's called R-5.
It's been genetically modified.

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:58.500
Why are you doing this?
Do you know what it's like...

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:03.964
to be a foreigner in this country?
For me, that was slow death.

01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:08.760
It wasn't pretty.
I was derided from the day I arrived here.

01:04:09.136 --> 01:04:10.804
Especially at school.

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:13.849
The kids weren't very nice.
Kids can be cruel.

01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:16.977
They called me 'trailer boy'.

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:20.397
Do I look like a trailer boy to you?

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.151
Darrius smell. That's what they called me

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:27.070
- You know why?
- Because you didn't wash?

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.406
No, it's okay.

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:33.243
No, it's because they were snobs. And
I hated all of them.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:38.707
They made my life miserable.
And there was one kid in particular.

01:04:38.916 --> 01:04:40.959
And do you know who this kid
grew up to be?

01:04:41.419 --> 01:04:44.462
The Prime Minister. That's who.

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:50.427
I'm used to it.
My whole life I've been treated that way.

01:04:51.929 --> 01:04:53.889
so this is what it's all about?

01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:57.726
- Revenge?
- Revenge can be good.

01:04:57.977 --> 01:05:02.188
Because in a few hours
at the science Museum...

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:04.482
my old friend, the Prime Minister ...

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.402
he's gonna press a button,
and you know what's gonna happen?

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:14.242
That button's gonna connect all the
stormbreakers on my wireless network.

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:17.329
And at the same moment,
it's gonna release a virus...

01:05:17.538 --> 01:05:21.416
straight into the classes packed with
"British school children".

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.419
You're gonna kill thousands of
innocent people.

01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:28.423
No, of course not. I'm gonna kill millions.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.135
You're not being serious?

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:39.142
so you were bullied.
Lots of people are bullied.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:42.604
But it doesn't change them into
raging psychopaths.

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:46.566
You should be careful how you talk to me.

01:05:51.572 --> 01:05:54.908
That was a good shot.
Actually, it was a near miss.

01:05:55.826 --> 01:06:00.288
I'd love to hang out here and shoot
the breeze with you, but...

01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:02.999
I've got an important appointment
in London, so...

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:06.878
I'm gonna leave you to Nadia.
I'll see you guys when it's over.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.172
Cheerio, old boy.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:20.892
- They won't listen to us.
- What?

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:24.729
You know the Government view on intelligence.
They'd sooner trust an Ouija board.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:28.024
They're ignoring my advice and going
ahead with the ceremony.

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:32.320
- What about security? I'm throwing
a net around the science Museum.

01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:35.240
What about Alex?
He wasn't on the twelve o'clock plane.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.410
Well, let's hope he can look after
himself.

01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:55.010
Let me out!

01:06:56.053 --> 01:07:01.016
The jellyfish cannot attack you.
It has, no brains.

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:05.812
But you will tire soon.
And drift into its embrace, and then...

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:14.696
A souvenir for Mr Sayle.

01:07:28.502 --> 01:07:29.377
say "cheese".

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.409
What are you doing?

01:08:03.704 --> 01:08:05.246
You damn kid!

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:47.913
Intruder alert.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:51.459
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

01:10:20.507 --> 01:10:23.343
Mr Grin, you have received clearance
from French Air Control.

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:36.439
Sabina, remember to keep
your heels down.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.625
Mr Grin?

01:10:57.127 --> 01:11:01.256
I want you to fly me to London as
fast as you can.

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:10.390
It's red button day. In just a few
minutes, the Prime Minister...

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:15.228
will activate the stormbreaker
computers in schools nationwide.

01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:19.816
Darrius sayle has insisted that the Prime
Minister be the one to press the button.

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:25.280
He's made it button fingerprint
sensitive, so nobody can take his place.

01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:27.699
Let's cross live now
to the science Museum.

01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:35.248
Ladies and gentlemen, the stormbreaker
will be launched in five minutes.

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:42.630
- Where's Alex?
- We don't know.

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:46.342
- You promised me you'd look after him.
- We don't have time for this now.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:48.428
What do you mean? Where's Alex?

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.519
Ladies and gentlemen, Darrius Sayle.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.177
The message is clear.

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:33.681
Education, education and...

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.476
education.

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:41.064
Which is why I am delighted to accept
the most generous offer...

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:46.569
from one of our foremost entrepreneurs
and an old school colleague of mine ...

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.780
Darrius smell.

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:51.199
Sayle.

01:12:51.825 --> 01:12:53.409
Darrius Sayle.

01:13:09.426 --> 01:13:10.468
I'm just...

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.596
so glad to be here with my...

01:13:14.681 --> 01:13:16.933
my dear friend, the Prime Minister.

01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:21.020
And I'm gonna tell you,
the Prime Minister is the one

01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:25.566
who must take credit for what's
about to happen here.

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:33.783
My stormbreakers will transform the
lives of every child in this country.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.701
And let me tell you...

01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:38.246
this is a day that none of you...

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:40.248
will ever forget.

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:45.002
Now I'll ask my old friend to press
this button that'll send a signal...

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:48.631
that will activate the
stormbreakers across the nation.

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:51.926
Twenty seconds to stormbreaker
launch.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:54.345
stand by all schools.

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:55.471
Here we go.

01:13:58.308 --> 01:13:59.225
Ten...

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:01.769
nine...

01:14:02.312 --> 01:14:03.396
eight...

01:14:04.314 --> 01:14:05.481
seven...

01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:07.650
six...

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.485
five...

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:11.696
four...

01:14:12.739 --> 01:14:13.906
three...

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:16.242
two...

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:18.494
one.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.964
Give me that.
This is a Red Alert. secure the area.

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:32.967
Hold your fire, he's with us.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.023
Keep calm. He's unarmed.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.443
- Cub? - Wolf?

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:51.777
He's with us.

01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:53.279
Come on, press it.

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:55.031
- Give me the gun.
- Press the button.

01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:55.948
Now!

01:14:58.327 --> 01:14:59.660
Get down, now!

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.246
Don't panic. Everything's under control!

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:03.915
Hit the button!

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:13.257
- Darrius?
- You twerp!

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:18.179
- Get out of my way!
- stop Sayle!

01:15:28.398 --> 01:15:29.690
How could you let him slip away?

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.653
You realise you nearly shot the
Prime Minister?

01:15:33.904 --> 01:15:37.782
- Congratulations are in order.
- He's done very well. it's time to go.

01:15:37.991 --> 01:15:40.243
- What about Sayle?
- You can leave him to us.

01:15:47.584 --> 01:15:52.213
I can't believe I let you get mixed
up in all this. It's over. I'm taking you home.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:54.048
Where's he going?

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:58.261
To some remote land
where no-one will find him.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.888
Like Paraguay. Or Iowa.

01:16:01.765 --> 01:16:04.350
Don't suppose you've got the phone
number of that hunky soldier?

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.352
Do those people have phone numbers?

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.063
- What?
- That's it. That's Sayle Tower.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:12.275
I saw a model of the rooftop in Cornwall.
He was talking about a backup.

01:16:12.484 --> 01:16:15.736
something to do with a manual override.

01:16:16.363 --> 01:16:18.239
He's gonna set off the virus himself.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.537
Come on, come on.
The traffic in this city!

01:16:24.788 --> 01:16:25.871
Damn, we're not gonna make it!

01:16:26.206 --> 01:16:30.418
Come on.

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:33.754
Sabina?

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:40.761
Hi, can you put me through to Mrs Jones?

01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:45.641
I don't know her first name. I'm not sending
her a birthday card, it's an emergency!

01:16:49.813 --> 01:16:50.271
Hello?

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:58.029
Third company, left wheel!

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:01.824
Keep going.

01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:05.578
Ready, steady, go

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:08.289
Out of the way!

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:12.960
- Come back here!
- After them!

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.838
Come on!
shoulder to shoulder!

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.715
Charge!

01:17:18.675 --> 01:17:20.760
- Don't look back!
- Why not?

01:17:21.219 --> 01:17:22.136
Trust me.

01:17:35.275 --> 01:17:36.150
Ready, go

01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:39.862
Company halt!

01:17:57.714 --> 01:17:59.090
Yo, ready

Ready, steady, go

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:10.017
Come on.

01:18:19.152 --> 01:18:20.653
Ready, steady, go

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.281
strictly the mother...

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:29.120
If anyone comes in, kill them.

01:18:30.747 --> 01:18:31.789
strictly the mother...

01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:35.584
Ready, steady, go

01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:50.474
- Thanks, Sabina.
- Alex, wait!

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:07.616
schoolboy trick.

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:16.792
stop.

01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:18.544
sorry!

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.942
Two section, quickly! Down here!

01:19:42.235 --> 01:19:43.652
Move yourselves!
Over here!

01:19:43.987 --> 01:19:46.113
- They're in there.
- He's on the roof.

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:47.782
Don't you dare hurt them.

01:19:50.368 --> 01:19:51.619
Take up positions.

01:19:51.828 --> 01:19:52.912
Get up there!

01:19:59.669 --> 01:20:00.795
Loading complete.

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:14.850
Power failure.

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:19.522
satellite link interrupted.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:23.192
Put it down, boy!

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:28.155
I said, put it down.

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:48.843
stay away!

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:54.014
No!

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:55.766
Do you have eyeball?

01:20:58.603 --> 01:21:00.813
Target acquired.
We can take them. Now.

01:21:01.147 --> 01:21:03.399
Fire at my command.
you'll hurt Alex!

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.067
This isn't only about Alex.

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:09.530
- No, wait. I don't think
this is the time for an argument.

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:11.866
There is no argument.

01:21:14.661 --> 01:21:15.452
Very well.

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:18.289
stand down. stand down.

01:21:18.915 --> 01:21:19.915
Back off!

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:55.326
- Hang on. You know what got me?
What really got me.

01:21:56.244 --> 01:21:57.536
They send a boy.

01:21:57.787 --> 01:22:00.915
I don't wanna rock your boat,
but the party's over.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.334
- Adios.
- Prepare to fire.

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:52.925
Sabina, I'm gonna swing you on to
the balcony.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:56.762
- Alex, don't, the cable will break!
- I can do it!

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:16.365
No!

01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:29.670
Need a hand?

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:55.237
Why?

01:23:55.905 --> 01:23:59.408
Sayle became an embarrassment to
my employers.

01:23:59.659 --> 01:24:00.909
What about me?

01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:04.246
I had no instructions concerning you.

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:09.084
This doesn't change anything.

01:24:10.503 --> 01:24:12.588
You killed my uncle.
You're still my enemy.

01:24:13.339 --> 01:24:15.632
I have a lot of enemies.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:20.679
- This isn't over.
- Yes, Alex, it is.

01:24:25.935 --> 01:24:27.436
Go back to school.

01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:32.566
You don't belong to the same world as me.

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:35.527
You should forget about me.

01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:39.907
I'll never forget you.

01:24:43.828 --> 01:24:45.245
It's your choice.

01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:45.681
You know they made me sign the
Official secrets Act?

01:25:46.015 --> 01:25:49.268
- I'm not allowed to tell anyone what happened.
- Me, too.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.521
- Are you really a spy?
- No.

01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:56.900
That's not what they told me.
I'm not a spy. And it won't happen again.

01:25:57.193 --> 01:25:58.694
- No?
- No.

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:00.445
I'm just me.
