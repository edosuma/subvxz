00:27.892 --> 00:31.058
THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS.

01:33.392 --> 01:34.600
It’s good to be back.

01:42.017 --> 01:43.683
Come. Papa.

02:00.767 --> 02:02.350
It's good to be back.

02:04.475 --> 02:06.683
Our memory is fragile.

02:07.308 --> 02:09.892
A lifetime is very brief.

02:10.392 --> 02:14.100
Things happens so fast we do not
have time to understand...

02:14.267 --> 02:16.808
the relationship between events.

02:17.183 --> 02:19.683
This is what my mother
wrote in her diaries...

02:19.933 --> 02:22.850
in order to keep track of time.

02:27.392 --> 02:28.725
What's wrong?

02:33.475 --> 02:34.558
Do you want to lie down?

02:40.017 --> 02:41.850
I miss Clara.

02:49.683 --> 02:52.350
I think that Mama
is with us right now.

02:56.267 --> 02:57.767
Come and lie down.

03:02.392 --> 03:06.475
My mother always talked
about love as a miracle.

03:07.392 --> 03:12.142
Since she was a child she wrote
everything in her diaries...

03:12.225 --> 03:15.142
in order to see things in their
true dimension.

03:18.308 --> 03:21.142
It's was the first time
she saw my father.

03:21.850 --> 03:24.558
Even though my father
had come to propose...

03:24.725 --> 03:26.642
to my mother's old sister, Rosa,

03:27.767 --> 03:30.225
my mother knew she was
in love with him.

03:42.933 --> 03:46.683
Dear, we can't hear
what we're saying.

03:55.350 --> 03:58.267
So, Esteban as Rosa wants it too,

03:58.725 --> 04:00.392
what's important to us,

04:01.017 --> 04:02.975
is that Rosa should be happy.

04:03.642 --> 04:05.433
I've decided that...

04:05.892 --> 04:08.142
if I work hard every day.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.225
I'm convinced that,

04:12.058 --> 04:14.142
if I work hard every day,

04:14.975 --> 04:17.975
then one day
I will be rich enough to.

04:24.017 --> 04:24.850
Then one day,

04:25.892 --> 04:28.308
I will be rich enough
to lead Rosa to the altar.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.725
After 2 years, my father found
the gold to bring him back to Rosa.

05:10.808 --> 05:13.475
Love had driven him deep into
the mine, but hard work...

05:13.642 --> 05:16.975
and waiting only made
his longing greater.

05:18.267 --> 05:19.767
Finally he succeeded...

05:19.933 --> 05:22.683
and he would soon return
to lead Rosa to the altar.

05:28.350 --> 05:31.183
People had come to celebrate
my grandfather's nomination...

05:31.308 --> 05:33.517
as a candidate for the liberal party.

05:37.933 --> 05:39.892
Although my grandparents tried...

05:40.058 --> 05:42.558
to keep my mother's
supernatural power secret,

05:42.933 --> 05:44.642
everyone knew about them.

05:45.350 --> 05:48.350
People clandestinely came
to my mother for advice.

05:49.725 --> 05:53.100
I just wanted to know if
Clara could tell me.

05:53.308 --> 05:55.308
I've run up a great debt.

05:56.517 --> 05:58.725
Being a politician,
It's a scandal.

05:59.017 --> 06:00.767
I don't know what to do.

06:01.475 --> 06:02.767
My family...

06:02.850 --> 06:04.933
"Black Devil" will win on Sunday.

06:05.850 --> 06:06.683
What?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.475
In the third race.

06:09.475 --> 06:11.808
Well, I really must thank you.

06:13.725 --> 06:16.767
I promise never to ask
for your help again. Thank you.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.433
It's my fiancé and l.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.142
I'm so unhappy.

06:25.433 --> 06:27.975
So I thought maybe
Clara could help.

06:28.517 --> 06:31.767
Maybe give me a hint of how
to make him love me again.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.600
Your fiancé can't stand
the smell of lavender.

06:35.767 --> 06:39.142
So if you stop smearing
yourself with lavender oil,

06:40.558 --> 06:42.225
he might start
wanting you again.

06:46.517 --> 06:47.933
What is it?

06:56.725 --> 06:59.767
You should be ashamed of yourselves,
upsetting Clara like this.

07:10.683 --> 07:12.850
Rosa, what is she saying?

07:15.517 --> 07:18.350
She says there will soon
be a death in our family.

07:18.475 --> 07:20.433
But it will happen by accident.

07:24.517 --> 07:29.017
The Conservative Party has been
in power as long as I can remember.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.433
There are the party of greed,
corruption, intolerance and old ideas.

07:34.058 --> 07:37.517
We, the Liberal Party,
have to fight them.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.058
Thank you, dear friends,
for your support.

07:40.142 --> 07:41.183
Thank you.

08:02.975 --> 08:04.267
You drink the toast.

08:04.975 --> 08:07.558
The one who carves the pig.
That's tradition.

08:07.975 --> 08:09.017
Come on!

09:19.975 --> 09:22.767
There is enough poison in
that brandy to kill an ox.

09:23.183 --> 09:23.850
But,

09:25.017 --> 09:27.600
just to be certain that's
what killed Rosa,

09:28.058 --> 09:30.017
I'll have to do an autopsy.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.183
I'll have to examine her.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.142
Do you mean...

09:34.433 --> 09:35.642
you must cut her up?

09:39.475 --> 09:43.808
Clara, it's isn't your fault.

09:51.475 --> 09:53.267
You can't provoke events...

09:55.600 --> 09:56.475
darling.

09:58.433 --> 10:00.225
You must sense them a little...

10:00.892 --> 10:02.767
before they happen.

10:30.767 --> 10:34.017
And Rosa had to die instead of me.

10:35.933 --> 10:38.600
No, I don't need revenge.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.600
Revenge doesn't do
anybody any good.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.225
Revenge...

10:45.517 --> 10:47.433
won't bring Rosa back.

10:49.058 --> 10:53.058
Why did I get involved in politics
in this country?

10:53.308 --> 10:56.017
It's nothing but murderers and bandits.

11:27.725 --> 11:31.808
My mother was convinced that it
was her fault that Rosa has died.

11:32.892 --> 11:36.642
She believe if she ever spoke again,
it could cause new accidents.

11:40.225 --> 11:44.183
Tormented by grief and guilt,
she remained silent.

11:45.933 --> 11:49.600
She decided not to utter
a word to anyone anymore.

11:52.808 --> 11:54.225
Is it true, Clara?

12:14.933 --> 12:17.517
Couldn't you have
waited for me, Rosa?

12:19.183 --> 12:21.267
Why didn't you wait for me?

12:22.517 --> 12:24.892
If I'd known you had
such a short time left,

12:26.225 --> 12:29.183
I would have stolen the money
I needed to marry you.

12:31.183 --> 12:33.017
I would've made you happy.

12:47.808 --> 12:51.850
After my mother stopped speaking,
she lived in a world of her own,

12:52.267 --> 12:54.433
wrapped in her fantasies.

12:55.517 --> 12:58.850
A world where logic and physics
couldn't always...

12:59.058 --> 13:00.600
be applied.

13:01.767 --> 13:05.350
Surrounded by spirits of
the air and water and earth...

13:07.058 --> 13:11.767
making it unnecessary for her
to utter a word for many years.

13:19.433 --> 13:20.892
I'm not going back.

13:21.642 --> 13:23.725
You have to work at something.

13:24.475 --> 13:26.308
Her medicines are expensive.

13:26.475 --> 13:27.350
I'm finished.

13:32.933 --> 13:34.183
I'm finished.

13:59.017 --> 14:03.600
You realize how many years I've been
taking care of my mother?

14:05.100 --> 14:08.475
The path to Jesus is through
devotion and suffering.

14:08.683 --> 14:10.808
That's what you taught me.

14:13.975 --> 14:15.100
I'm leaving.

14:15.350 --> 14:16.892
I hate this city.

14:17.058 --> 14:19.225
Why don't you say
you hate this house?

14:19.850 --> 14:20.933
It's that too.

14:22.517 --> 14:24.850
I'd have liked to have been a man,

14:26.017 --> 14:27.433
so I could leave too.

14:27.725 --> 14:30.392
I'm glad I was never
born a woman.

14:31.975 --> 14:34.933
I've bought an old farm with
the money from the mine.

14:35.892 --> 14:36.767
We'll miss you.

14:42.892 --> 14:44.517
Write if mother gets worse.

15:32.850 --> 15:33.475
Hey there!

15:34.558 --> 15:36.392
Would you carry me to
Tres Marias?

16:20.433 --> 16:21.558
What's your name?

16:22.183 --> 16:23.017
Segundo.

16:23.683 --> 16:24.892
I'm the patron here now.

16:25.642 --> 16:28.017
Anyone who doesn't like it
can leave.

16:28.308 --> 16:29.475
Those who stay,

16:29.642 --> 16:32.058
won't lack food, but will
have to work good and hard.

16:32.850 --> 16:33.725
Understand?

16:34.683 --> 16:35.850
We understand, Patron.

16:36.683 --> 16:38.267
We have no place to go.

16:59.850 --> 17:00.850
Push, push.

17:01.683 --> 17:02.558
Push.

17:04.142 --> 17:05.892
Look out! You'll break the wheel.

17:06.058 --> 17:06.892
Come on. I'll count.

17:08.224 --> 17:10.308
One, two, three!

19:07.725 --> 19:11.350
Over the next 20 years,
my father built up Tres Marias

19:11.517 --> 19:15.100
to be one of the most productive
haciendas in the country.

19:17.142 --> 19:20.267
He worked hard from morning to night.

19:20.642 --> 19:24.267
And was constantly in conflict with
his discontented workers.

19:24.975 --> 19:27.975
They want me to pay them wages?
What is this?

19:28.392 --> 19:30.392
I'm severe, but always fair.

19:30.892 --> 19:34.850
In spite of the toil and conflict,
my father enjoyed the awareness that

19:35.183 --> 19:39.517
everything he owned was the fruit
of his own hard work.

19:46.808 --> 19:47.642
How much?

19:49.808 --> 19:52.058
If you'd lend me some money instead?

19:53.142 --> 19:54.558
You've got a nerve.

19:54.850 --> 19:56.350
50 pesos, Patron.

19:57.767 --> 20:00.975
You're the mightiest
and richest man in town.

20:01.933 --> 20:04.017
I wouldn't ask anybody else.

20:07.392 --> 20:08.392
Why so much?

20:09.142 --> 20:10.642
A train ticket to town,

20:11.642 --> 20:12.600
a red dress,

20:14.850 --> 20:18.558
a pair of high-heeled shoes,
a bottle of perfume,

20:18.683 --> 20:20.225
and a permanent.

20:20.350 --> 20:22.600
I want to be rich and famous.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.933
What if I never see you again?

20:27.058 --> 20:28.558
We'll see each other again.

20:31.058 --> 20:31.725
I know.

20:35.892 --> 20:36.933
Trust me.

20:37.933 --> 20:38.933
What's your name?

20:39.642 --> 20:40.600
Transito.

20:45.392 --> 20:46.475
You've got a deal!

20:47.267 --> 20:49.058
I like ambitious people.

20:55.767 --> 20:57.933
- Will that be all?
- That will do.

21:08.683 --> 21:10.100
Telegram for you, Patron.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.058
Remember when we were children?

21:53.975 --> 21:55.558
I used to cook for you,

21:57.308 --> 21:58.767
get you off to school.

22:01.142 --> 22:04.517
I could take care of you again.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.808
I'll do what Mother asked me to do.

22:25.767 --> 22:28.058
The could accept me
as a son-in-law once.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.892
They can do it again.

22:32.058 --> 22:33.308
She's not well.

22:34.308 --> 22:36.558
Her sister Rosa was special.

22:36.975 --> 22:38.975
At least she was healthy and normal.

22:39.517 --> 22:43.433
But Clara is strange.
You'll never be happy with her.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.642
You're jealous.

22:45.225 --> 22:46.642
You've never been in love.

22:47.642 --> 22:49.892
Nothing left for you but
a home for old spinsters.

22:49.975 --> 22:53.558
She'll never be able to love you
the way you should be.

22:54.683 --> 22:56.642
Clara is too strange.

22:57.017 --> 22:59.183
You need a woman to
take care of you.

22:59.725 --> 23:02.225
Somebody to worship and obey you.

23:02.558 --> 23:03.600
That's enough, Ferula!

23:08.808 --> 23:13.308
She spends her time in another world
since Rosa's death.

23:13.850 --> 23:14.517
I know.

23:14.683 --> 23:17.058
Not because she can't speak.

23:17.433 --> 23:19.058
She just never wanted to.

23:20.100 --> 23:20.850
I know.

23:21.642 --> 23:25.475
As long as she can bear
healthy children.

23:26.725 --> 23:28.892
Maybe we protected her too much.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.433
It's not possible to give someone
too much affection.

23:34.267 --> 23:35.933
Maybe I could meet her now?

23:40.017 --> 23:42.017
Don't make any hasty decisions.

23:43.183 --> 23:47.183
Meet her first. The we must also
consider Clara's wishes.

23:47.350 --> 23:48.475
Don't you think?

24:55.350 --> 24:57.600
You've come to ask me to marry you.

25:00.558 --> 25:02.475
Don't be impertinent!

25:02.642 --> 25:05.350
I want to know.
Let's not waste time!

25:05.517 --> 25:07.642
I also like things
to be direct.

25:07.808 --> 25:08.517
Yes.

25:08.850 --> 25:10.267
She said something!

25:10.433 --> 25:11.475
That's why I came.

25:11.558 --> 25:14.267
- She spoke!
- She said something!

25:16.475 --> 25:17.058
She said something

25:17.642 --> 25:18.600
You said something!

25:20.642 --> 25:22.100
She spoke!

25:23.642 --> 25:25.308
She speaks!

25:28.683 --> 25:31.517
Thank you, Clara.
You've made me very happy.

25:59.683 --> 26:00.933
Everything all right?

26:14.558 --> 26:16.183
Good afternoon, Ferula.

26:18.683 --> 26:20.017
Sorry I'm late.

26:20.642 --> 26:24.433
I suddenly couldn't remember
if it was today.

26:27.142 --> 26:28.725
I owe you an explanation for

26:30.267 --> 26:31.975
asking you to come here.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.392
I hope I haven't...

26:35.058 --> 26:36.808
kept you here sitting long.

26:37.308 --> 26:39.850
Not at all. I'm so glad
you could come.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.683
I don't often come
to places like this.

26:43.517 --> 26:45.433
In fact, I've never been here before.

26:48.433 --> 26:49.475
Good.

26:53.225 --> 26:55.475
I wanted to talk to you about...

27:02.058 --> 27:04.017
You don't have to worry.

27:04.558 --> 27:07.142
You're going to come and live
with me and Esteban.

27:07.642 --> 27:10.808
We'll be just like sisters.

27:14.225 --> 27:16.933
And our friendship will last

27:17.517 --> 27:19.475
for the rest of our lives.

27:25.308 --> 27:28.600
Don't worry about Esteban.
I'll talk to him.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.308
We won't even tell him we met.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.475
Will we?

27:39.225 --> 27:42.558
Forgive me. I'm sorry.
I don't usually cry.

27:43.017 --> 27:46.392
It's just, I'm not used to anyone
touching me. I'm sorry.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.058
I'm not used to anyone
being nice to me.

27:50.433 --> 27:53.350
No one has ever shown me
any tenderness.

27:54.392 --> 27:56.475
Forgive me. It's just...

27:58.017 --> 27:59.142
I'm so...

27:59.642 --> 28:00.767
confused and...

28:01.267 --> 28:02.475
relieved.

28:03.058 --> 28:04.058
Thank you,

28:04.350 --> 28:05.183
dear Clara.

28:07.850 --> 28:09.433
Dear sister Ferula.

28:14.225 --> 28:15.267
Sister.

28:16.933 --> 28:18.100
Wilt thou,

28:18.767 --> 28:20.433
Esteban Trueba,

28:21.267 --> 28:23.142
take Clara del Valle,

28:24.267 --> 28:26.225
to be your lawful wedded wife,

28:27.267 --> 28:29.183
to have and to hold,

28:29.850 --> 28:31.933
in sickness and in health,

28:33.058 --> 28:35.017
for richer or poorer,

28:35.850 --> 28:37.392
till death do you part?

28:38.392 --> 28:39.392
I will.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.475
And wilt thou, Clara del Valle,

28:50.767 --> 28:52.683
take Esteban Trueba,

28:53.308 --> 28:55.475
to be your lawful wedded husband,

28:56.558 --> 28:58.142
to have and to hold,

28:59.058 --> 29:01.183
in sickness and in health,

29:01.892 --> 29:03.850
for richer or poorer,

29:04.808 --> 29:06.808
till death do you part?

29:07.475 --> 29:08.308
I will.

29:13.475 --> 29:14.767
Yes, I will.

29:39.517 --> 29:41.183
It's so beautiful.

30:07.142 --> 30:08.642
Oh, it's beautiful!

30:09.225 --> 30:10.350
Welcome to Tres marias.

30:11.767 --> 30:13.517
Remember my sister Ferula?

30:18.600 --> 30:19.767
You must be tired.

30:20.267 --> 30:21.892
I'll make you hot chocolate.

30:22.267 --> 30:24.517
No, I'm not tired.

30:24.892 --> 30:26.392
Was it a good trip?

30:28.017 --> 30:30.475
She's not a child.
Don't treat her like one.

30:42.350 --> 30:43.892
My dear Esteban!

32:22.725 --> 32:26.433
Bless me, Father. I have sinned.
It's a week since my last confession.

32:27.100 --> 32:27.767
Father,

32:29.683 --> 32:31.808
I think I've committed
a terrible sin.

32:32.267 --> 32:33.100
Of the flesh?

32:33.642 --> 32:35.642
My flesh is withered,
but not my spirit.

32:36.975 --> 32:38.933
The devil is tormenting me.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.017
God's mercy is infinite.

32:41.267 --> 32:44.517
You don't know the thoughts that run
through the mind of a lonely women.

32:46.433 --> 32:49.683
A virgin who has never
been with a man.

32:52.017 --> 32:54.308
Not for lack of opportunity,
but because God

32:55.642 --> 32:59.225
sent my mother an illness and
I had to be her nurse.

32:59.392 --> 33:01.892
That sacrifice is recorded
in Heaven.

33:02.808 --> 33:05.017
Even if I've sinned in
my thoughts, Father?

33:06.767 --> 33:09.517
Well, it depends on your thoughts.

33:16.558 --> 33:17.683
Sometimes,

33:19.017 --> 33:20.308
at night,

33:21.517 --> 33:22.808
I can't sleep.

33:24.850 --> 33:26.767
I feel as if I'm choking.

33:28.683 --> 33:32.017
To calm down, I get up,
walk around the house.

33:33.600 --> 33:37.933
I go to my sister-in-law's room
and put my ear to her door.

33:39.475 --> 33:40.767
Sometimes,

33:41.308 --> 33:44.517
I tiptoe in and watch her
while she's sleeping.

33:46.433 --> 33:49.183
I used to think she was
stupid and incompetent.

33:50.850 --> 33:53.017
Now I know she's of another world.

33:54.725 --> 33:56.892
Maybe her time on Earth is...

33:57.725 --> 33:59.600
just a small part of her.

34:01.058 --> 34:02.350
She might be...

34:02.933 --> 34:05.600
closer to God than we are,
Father Antonio.

34:08.933 --> 34:11.141
She looks like the Angel of Light.

34:14.891 --> 34:17.058
I want to climb into her bed,

34:18.850 --> 34:20.308
and feel...

34:21.933 --> 34:24.225
the warmth of her skin,

34:24.850 --> 34:26.225
and her gentle breathing.

34:27.183 --> 34:28.183
Pray, my child.

34:29.350 --> 34:30.391
Prayers help.

34:31.391 --> 34:32.558
Wait, I'm not finished.

34:37.516 --> 34:39.850
When my brother sometimes
sleeps with her,

34:40.975 --> 34:42.308
it's even worse.

34:43.975 --> 34:47.725
My prayers are useless.

34:48.641 --> 34:49.975
I can't sleep.

34:51.141 --> 34:53.600
I sweat. My whole body shakes.

34:55.016 --> 34:58.767
Finally, I get up and walk
through the dark house.

35:00.725 --> 35:02.475
I glide down the corridor,

35:03.142 --> 35:05.683
very carefully, so the floor
won't squeak.

35:07.892 --> 35:09.308
I listen to them,

35:10.433 --> 35:12.433
through their bedroom door.

35:14.267 --> 35:16.058
And once I even saw them,

35:17.058 --> 35:19.225
because their door was ajar.

35:21.433 --> 35:22.558
What I saw,

35:24.058 --> 35:27.725
I can't tell you Father.
It's too big a sin.

35:30.933 --> 35:32.350
It's not Clara's fault.

35:33.183 --> 35:36.517
She's as innocent a child.
My brother lead her into it.

35:37.475 --> 35:40.100
He desires more than her body.

35:40.642 --> 35:43.850
He wants to own the most secret
thing she holds inside her.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.142
He's eternally damned.

35:46.767 --> 35:48.142
Only God can judge,

35:48.433 --> 35:50.225
and damn, my child.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.308
But,

35:53.558 --> 35:55.308
what were they doing?

35:57.267 --> 35:59.683
You used to be a gifted narrator.

36:02.475 --> 36:03.475
Well,

36:06.267 --> 36:08.517
I couldn't see very well.

36:10.142 --> 36:12.642
But what I sensed was incredible.

36:14.183 --> 36:17.933
The trembling movements,

36:19.475 --> 36:21.975
the abundance of juices,

36:23.642 --> 36:26.308
The words whispered in her ear.

36:28.767 --> 36:31.017
The strange secret smells.

36:33.850 --> 36:35.267
A veritable miracle.

36:44.183 --> 36:45.267
It's a little girl.

36:47.642 --> 36:49.642
And her name will be Blanca.

36:54.475 --> 36:56.017
Isn't she beautiful, Esteban?

36:59.100 --> 37:01.517
I wish Mother could've seen this.

37:01.850 --> 37:04.475
She would've been proud of you.
And to think...

37:05.517 --> 37:07.600
a little girl.

37:09.017 --> 37:11.142
I don't like the way
she walks around so much.

37:11.725 --> 37:14.267
The doctor told her
to rest a lot.

37:16.183 --> 37:18.850
He also said she shouldn't
sleep with you anymore.

37:19.017 --> 37:19.683
What?

37:20.225 --> 37:23.683
He said it wasn't good for Clara
if you slept together.

37:24.267 --> 37:25.433
He didn't say that to me.

37:26.142 --> 37:27.725
I'm just telling you
what he said.

37:29.267 --> 37:30.600
But I think he means...

37:31.308 --> 37:35.433
you're too heavy for the baby,
or Clara's frail body.

37:37.017 --> 37:39.808
I don't think it's good for Clara
with too much excitement.

37:41.600 --> 37:45.017
You're interfering in matters
that don't concern you.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.475
Good Morning.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.058
Is kissing really necessary?

37:50.350 --> 37:52.517
Oh, yes. It is.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.058
Feel her kicking.

38:00.392 --> 38:03.808
I think she wants to come out
and greet her grandparents.

38:04.892 --> 38:06.183
They're coming today.

38:06.975 --> 38:08.600
We must go for your bath.

38:09.142 --> 38:10.017
Oh, yes.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.350
That would feel good.

38:17.183 --> 38:19.808
The doctor gave me almond oil,
to rub on your stomach.

38:20.142 --> 38:22.808
To prevent the skin stretching.

39:35.225 --> 39:36.142
I'm terribly sorry.

39:36.975 --> 39:40.558
I told them to take the train,
but Papa insisted on driving in

39:41.017 --> 39:43.308
that old car.

39:44.267 --> 39:45.517
There's something else.

39:47.392 --> 39:49.017
- It's terrible.
- Tell me.

39:50.017 --> 39:53.225
Because of this violent
collision with the train,

39:54.475 --> 39:57.433
your parents were hurled
from the car.

39:59.808 --> 40:01.933
Your mother's head was
severed from her body.

40:03.017 --> 40:04.558
And the terrible thing is...

40:04.850 --> 40:06.808
But I know where it is!

40:07.892 --> 40:09.600
- Stop this...
- I tell you...

40:09.767 --> 40:10.808
I know where it is!

40:11.642 --> 40:13.433
The police have looked everywhere.

40:14.267 --> 40:18.017
I'm sorry, my wife's a little...
It's the pregnancy.

40:18.392 --> 40:20.225
Sister Ferula, will you help me?

40:26.725 --> 40:27.558
It's here.

40:28.392 --> 40:28.975
It's here.

40:30.017 --> 40:31.892
We're too far away from
the accident.

40:32.350 --> 40:34.600
It's here. I know.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.225
I tell you, it's here.

40:43.808 --> 40:45.433
Could you do me a favour,

40:45.975 --> 40:49.933
crawl in and hand me the head
you'll find in there?

40:50.308 --> 40:51.600
And hurry up.

40:52.142 --> 40:53.308
Hurry up, senor.

40:54.767 --> 40:56.433
I think my time has come.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.308
Hurry up, senor.

41:27.100 --> 41:30.225
That's right. Relax.

41:30.975 --> 41:31.725
Push.

41:33.308 --> 41:34.725
- It's all right.
- Push.

41:35.808 --> 41:36.433
Come on.

41:37.017 --> 41:37.933
It's coming.

41:52.433 --> 41:55.225
Welcome to the world,
little Blanca.

41:58.017 --> 41:59.017
Hold it flat.

41:59.683 --> 42:02.642
- Concentrate, Blanca.
- You're the champion.

42:03.350 --> 42:04.933
You hit it back to Aunt Ferula!

42:16.933 --> 42:18.558
Come on, Ferula, hit it harder.

42:20.058 --> 42:22.017
Do you have to play in a hat?

42:24.767 --> 42:25.725
We'll win this.

42:31.308 --> 42:32.808
If you keep it on the court...

42:34.058 --> 42:34.850
Keep it in here.

42:35.433 --> 42:36.767
Don't hit it so far out!

42:41.767 --> 42:42.558
Come on.

42:42.725 --> 42:44.017
Stop fooling around.

42:52.183 --> 42:52.975
Almost!

42:53.600 --> 42:56.475
You're supposed to teach
Clara the game.

43:01.308 --> 43:04.058
I think we won, little one.
Blanca's the champion!

43:09.933 --> 43:12.767
I wish Mother were alive,
so I could send you back to her.

43:20.183 --> 43:22.808
Let's have a cool drink,
just the two of us.

43:23.308 --> 43:25.142
Would you come play with me?

43:25.475 --> 43:27.058
Please, could you play?

43:32.642 --> 43:34.017
All right.

43:39.058 --> 43:40.975
Who is that?

43:44.600 --> 43:46.017
Get out of here.

43:47.100 --> 43:49.225
We need money for food.

43:49.683 --> 43:51.017
Then get out and earn some!

43:52.058 --> 43:52.683
Get out!

43:53.308 --> 43:55.475
Don't you remember me, Esteban?

43:55.975 --> 43:57.475
Down by the river?

43:57.892 --> 43:59.225
This is your son.

44:00.142 --> 44:00.808
Look at him.

44:01.933 --> 44:03.308
I named him after you.

44:06.517 --> 44:07.892
What're you talking about?

44:09.517 --> 44:11.433
Take this and get out!
Go on, take it!

44:14.308 --> 44:18.058
If I see you on my property again,
I'll set the dogs on you.

44:19.058 --> 44:21.225
You'll never get rid of us,
Esteban!

44:22.308 --> 44:24.642
You'll never get rid of your son!

44:25.850 --> 44:28.142
Have you stopped playing?
Were you beating her?

44:48.725 --> 44:49.600
Who are you?

44:52.100 --> 44:53.558
My parents aren't in.

44:54.725 --> 44:55.683
I know.

44:56.475 --> 44:57.975
What do you want?

44:59.267 --> 45:01.642
- To see your house.
- You're not allowed to be here.

45:02.475 --> 45:05.558
Strangers aren't allowed
to walk in just like that.

45:06.183 --> 45:07.183
I know.

45:09.808 --> 45:10.892
Then leave.

45:18.850 --> 45:20.100
I'll leave soon.

45:42.350 --> 45:43.392
Come here.

45:45.225 --> 45:46.350
- Come.
- Why?

45:48.267 --> 45:50.100
I want to smell you.

45:58.517 --> 45:59.517
You smell good.

45:59.975 --> 46:02.225
It's bay rum.
My mother bathes me every morning.

46:12.725 --> 46:14.433
What a nice dress you've got.

46:16.100 --> 46:18.350
Sit with me so I can feel it.

46:19.725 --> 46:21.642
My Aunt Ferula made it.

46:30.392 --> 46:32.725
Imagine.
We have the same blood.

46:38.808 --> 46:40.558
I don't understand you.

47:01.767 --> 47:03.600
Your chocolate is ready.

47:13.392 --> 47:16.225
I'd like to ask Pedro...

47:16.600 --> 47:18.225
to stand up and tell us...

47:18.308 --> 47:19.017
his story...

47:19.183 --> 47:21.475
about the hens and the fox.

47:22.808 --> 47:24.725
Once there was a henhouse,

47:24.850 --> 47:28.433
and every night a fox
forced its way into it,

47:29.058 --> 47:31.933
to steal eggs and
eat baby chickens.

47:32.558 --> 47:34.392
This made the hens very angry.

47:43.975 --> 47:46.308
People are glad for the way
you teach them.

48:29.892 --> 48:34.475
Why can't you use your telepathic
abilities and tell me where they are?

48:34.975 --> 48:37.850
I can't contact anyone who
doesn't want to be found.

48:38.142 --> 48:40.350
If you hadn't started this school,
this wouldn't have happened.

48:44.558 --> 48:45.600
He found them.

48:46.183 --> 48:47.808
Segundo found them by the river.

48:48.433 --> 48:49.433
Are they all right?

48:58.475 --> 48:59.558
This is your fault!

48:59.767 --> 49:03.642
I don't want to see your son
with Blanca again! Understood?

49:04.100 --> 49:04.975
Understood, Patron.

49:07.267 --> 49:10.350
I'll close the school and
send Blanca to boarding school!

49:10.558 --> 49:12.975
No, you can't do that!

49:13.225 --> 49:14.017
Yes, I can!

49:14.392 --> 49:16.517
I won't watch
my daughter turn native.

49:17.392 --> 49:18.475
It's my duty...

49:18.892 --> 49:22.017
to provide her with a life among
people of her own class.

49:22.850 --> 49:24.142
There's no need...

49:24.225 --> 49:24.808
Shut up!

49:26.058 --> 49:28.267
Don't interfere in
my family affairs.

49:44.308 --> 49:45.642
School was over.

49:47.433 --> 49:50.683
The only thing which made
boarding school bearable...

49:51.308 --> 49:55.600
were the wonderful
summer vacations ahead of me.

50:15.725 --> 50:17.558
- Congratulations on your exam.
- Such a long time.

50:18.142 --> 50:19.350
We're very proud of you.

50:20.892 --> 50:22.225
So, no more school.

50:22.725 --> 50:24.350
I'm so glad you're home.

50:24.933 --> 50:25.933
Your mother and I missed you.

50:34.850 --> 50:38.142
Every year, Pedro and l
met secretly by the river.

50:40.933 --> 50:44.308
Now that I'd graduated,
we could be together forever.

51:41.600 --> 51:42.892
I missed you.

51:43.058 --> 51:46.683
I thought I'd die at school.
I'm never going back.

51:47.433 --> 51:48.808
From now on,
it's just you and me.

51:55.433 --> 51:56.225
What is it?

51:56.725 --> 51:57.725
You know,

51:59.058 --> 52:00.392
it's not only you and me.

52:00.725 --> 52:01.892
Yes, it is.

52:03.308 --> 52:05.767
I don't care what
my family thinks.

52:06.267 --> 52:08.142
I love you and you love me.

52:08.517 --> 52:09.933
That's what's important.

52:11.933 --> 52:12.808
They say you've started making

52:13.642 --> 52:15.767
political speeches.

52:16.642 --> 52:19.100
The peasants here
are suppressed by your father.

52:21.142 --> 52:22.183
They're afraid of him.

52:23.100 --> 52:24.558
They all hate him.

52:28.517 --> 52:32.308
Promise me to be careful.
Nothing must ever happen to you.

52:36.350 --> 52:37.308
I love you.

52:38.058 --> 52:39.225
I love you.

52:39.975 --> 52:41.600
I love you too.

52:52.058 --> 52:53.433
Welcome, Mr. Trueba!

52:57.392 --> 53:00.350
The Conservatives want
to make you a proposition.

53:00.975 --> 53:03.183
- I'm not a politician.
- You're a powerful man.

53:04.267 --> 53:07.267
A man of honour.
Just the kind of senator we need.

53:08.017 --> 53:09.225
The country is changing.

53:09.642 --> 53:11.892
Things aren't the way they were,
unfortunately.

53:12.350 --> 53:15.892
People are getting crazy ideas.
Peasants from your district...

53:16.058 --> 53:19.683
and workers in the cities
talk about uniting.

53:20.100 --> 53:21.808
If we don't make a stand now...

53:23.850 --> 53:24.808
I'll think about it.

53:25.350 --> 53:29.142
Do. You're a family man and
a family is worth protecting.

53:29.267 --> 53:30.933
We must protect our values.

53:31.058 --> 53:32.100
Who's that?

53:32.600 --> 53:36.308
Count Jean de Satigny.
He hasn't been in this country long.

53:37.350 --> 53:39.767
I understand he's very rich
but still a bachelor.

53:40.767 --> 53:44.308
Maybe your daughter would enjoy
adding a coat of arms to her card.

53:44.683 --> 53:47.100
Let me know what you decide
about the party.

53:50.017 --> 53:50.850
Excuse me.

53:53.433 --> 53:54.392
May I join you?

53:56.308 --> 53:59.100
I've heard a great deal about you.

54:00.100 --> 54:04.225
People say your hacienda is the most
beautiful property for miles.

54:05.392 --> 54:07.183
And the most efficient, I've heard.

54:07.892 --> 54:13.017
I hope to see it someday, to study
your methods. I admire...

54:13.225 --> 54:15.058
You're welcome to...

54:20.892 --> 54:21.600
Let's get out!

54:23.642 --> 54:24.392
The earthquake!

54:45.600 --> 54:48.058
Did you feel it here?
Did anything happen?

54:48.600 --> 54:49.850
Everything's all right.

55:38.850 --> 55:42.017
Clara asked me to lie beside her
till she fell asleep.

55:42.767 --> 55:46.725
She was so terrified during
the earthquake. That's all it was.

56:03.433 --> 56:04.267
It's over.

56:06.642 --> 56:08.600
You've spoiled my
family life long enough.

56:10.975 --> 56:13.642
I want you to leave
this house at once.

56:15.433 --> 56:16.892
I never want to see you again,

56:18.808 --> 56:21.808
and I forbid you to
see my wife,

56:23.642 --> 56:24.683
For my daughter.

56:27.058 --> 56:30.058
I'll send you money each month
through Father Antonio.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.975
You'll have enough to live
decently while I live.

56:38.225 --> 56:41.100
But if I ever catch you
bothering my family again,

56:44.517 --> 56:45.683
I'll kill you.

56:46.642 --> 56:47.933
I swear,

56:48.767 --> 56:50.433
on the soul of our mother,

56:52.558 --> 56:53.850
I'll kill you.

56:58.058 --> 56:59.600
I curse you, Esteban.

57:02.017 --> 57:03.683
You'll always be alone.

57:05.350 --> 57:07.933
Your body and soul will shrink.

57:08.433 --> 57:10.308
And you'll die afraid,

57:11.892 --> 57:13.558
and with a guilty conscience.

57:13.767 --> 57:14.600
Get out.

57:16.392 --> 57:17.975
For Clara's sake,

57:19.142 --> 57:23.558
I want you to know it's never been
the way you imagined between us.

57:26.183 --> 57:26.975
Never!

58:40.933 --> 58:42.933
I'd like to talk to you.

58:51.642 --> 58:53.142
How could you do this?

58:55.350 --> 58:57.017
How could you send her away?

58:57.558 --> 58:59.725
No one is between us anymore.

58:59.892 --> 59:01.267
She was never between us.

59:01.600 --> 59:02.558
I love you.

59:04.850 --> 59:06.142
I want to make you happy!

59:09.683 --> 59:12.392
I want us to have a
happy family!

59:13.433 --> 59:16.308
She's part of our family too.
She's your sister.

59:16.475 --> 59:18.308
I don't care about Ferula.

59:18.558 --> 59:21.433
I care about you and l.
Our love.

59:23.558 --> 59:24.975
Show me you love me.

59:28.475 --> 59:30.267
Show me I'm your husband.

59:34.392 --> 59:35.100
Love me.

59:37.017 --> 59:37.975
Love me.

59:38.725 --> 59:40.600
Do you hear? Love me!

59:48.058 --> 59:49.058
Help me.

59:50.558 --> 59:52.058
Tell me what I must do...

59:52.975 --> 59:56.600
to let us have a happy life
as husband and wife.

01:00:02.183 --> 01:00:04.433
Just give me some time.

01:00:12.767 --> 01:00:14.600
Just give me some time.

01:00:22.558 --> 01:00:24.642
Just give me some time,
Transito.

01:00:26.475 --> 01:00:27.892
You look good.

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:30.350
How did you find me, Patron?

01:00:32.308 --> 01:00:34.267
I asked for the best place in town.

01:00:35.267 --> 01:00:37.558
Now I can pay you back
the 50 pesos...

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.183
with interest.

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:45.892
I'd rather you owe me the favour.

01:00:54.392 --> 01:00:56.017
Just wait a little.

01:01:03.808 --> 01:01:05.142
Just show me...

01:01:06.392 --> 01:01:08.642
a little tenderness.

01:01:13.058 --> 01:01:15.142
Pretend to care for me.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.642
That's all I need.

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:18.725
But I do care for you.

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:29.017
Very much.

01:01:33.017 --> 01:01:34.058
Come.

01:01:37.267 --> 01:01:38.892
Come here with me.

01:01:44.475 --> 01:01:47.017
I feel so good with you.

01:01:49.392 --> 01:01:51.475
It's like coming home.

01:01:56.475 --> 01:01:58.475
You're the best, Esteban.

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:03.225
You're a strong man.

01:02:05.808 --> 01:02:07.308
Very, very strong.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.767
A man of the soil.

01:02:56.308 --> 01:03:00.517
There's one thing I don't understand,
Monsieur Tassigny.

01:03:00.933 --> 01:03:02.058
Satigny.

01:03:02.892 --> 01:03:03.642
And that is...

01:03:05.808 --> 01:03:08.683
what are you doing in our
barbaric country?

01:03:08.975 --> 01:03:09.767
Well...

01:03:10.308 --> 01:03:14.558
I'm in the fortunate position that
I don't have to work for a living.

01:03:16.767 --> 01:03:20.767
Only pass the time.
But a wealthy life,

01:03:21.308 --> 01:03:22.225
is boring.

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:23.600
You get restless.

01:03:24.392 --> 01:03:27.725
My vineyards in Liechtenstein
and on the Riviera...

01:03:28.933 --> 01:03:29.767
But...

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.308
this country...

01:03:33.517 --> 01:03:34.975
challenges me.

01:03:35.142 --> 01:03:37.392
Yes, but "monsieur" Tassigny...

01:03:37.725 --> 01:03:38.767
Satigny.

01:03:38.975 --> 01:03:41.183
It's still very strange,

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:44.600
because I've done it again and
I can't find you in my cards.

01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:48.308
Neither your family, nor your age,

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:51.183
where you're from.

01:03:51.475 --> 01:03:52.808
Perhaps your cards...

01:03:53.225 --> 01:03:55.433
can't see across the Atlantic.

01:03:57.517 --> 01:03:58.600
For me?

01:03:59.767 --> 01:04:00.517
Thank you.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.642
It's beautiful.

01:04:05.225 --> 01:04:06.100
500 tons...

01:04:06.725 --> 01:04:08.892
a year in two croppings.

01:04:09.558 --> 01:04:11.600
With our advantage over those
north of the Equator,

01:04:12.142 --> 01:04:16.267
we can produce ripe fruit at
the time of year they cannot.

01:04:16.975 --> 01:04:20.808
The will of God say we all have
a right to fight for Justice.

01:04:21.517 --> 01:04:22.725
It isn't the will of God,

01:04:23.267 --> 01:04:26.017
we wait for a reward in Heaven.

01:04:27.517 --> 01:04:30.058
Jesus Christ was a revolutionary.

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:32.767
We have a right to demand wages.

01:04:33.725 --> 01:04:34.683
Revolutionary?

01:04:35.267 --> 01:04:36.517
Yes, of course!

01:04:37.183 --> 01:04:39.225
We have a right to rest on Sundays.

01:04:40.017 --> 01:04:41.350
We have a right to vote.

01:04:41.517 --> 01:04:42.725
To be free.

01:04:43.933 --> 01:04:44.725
That's enough!

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.392
Go back to work.

01:04:52.142 --> 01:04:53.767
I said, go back to work!

01:05:06.392 --> 01:05:08.017
T tell them to go back to work.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.642
Please,

01:05:09.767 --> 01:05:11.850
go back to work.

01:05:23.392 --> 01:05:24.142
Come here.

01:05:27.725 --> 01:05:31.350
You never teach your son not
to look his patron in the face?

01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:45.808
Take your shirt off.

01:06:31.517 --> 01:06:32.725
Isn't...

01:06:33.517 --> 01:06:36.433
Tassigny joining us for dinner?

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:37.850
Satigny.

01:06:38.642 --> 01:06:39.892
Count Satigny.

01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:42.392
He's out studying the corn crop.

01:06:42.517 --> 01:06:45.017
He has a great interest
in agriculture.

01:06:45.683 --> 01:06:47.767
And in knowing how much you own.

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:53.517
I had to get rid of
Pedro Segundo today.

01:06:57.017 --> 01:06:58.892
He's never to show his
face here again.

01:06:59.517 --> 01:07:04.142
He was trying to turn the farmers
against me. Preaching revolution!

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.850
If not for his father,
I'd have shot him.

01:07:07.017 --> 01:07:08.058
Good God!

01:07:09.475 --> 01:07:11.600
I've spent my life trying...

01:07:13.225 --> 01:07:16.100
to help these people.
I gave them everything.

01:07:16.725 --> 01:07:19.517
And now this bastard talks to them
about their rights.

01:07:20.308 --> 01:07:21.392
They need looking after.

01:07:21.892 --> 01:07:24.100
They need justice, Papa,
not charity.

01:07:24.642 --> 01:07:26.058
They're like children.

01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:27.850
They need a strong hand.

01:07:29.475 --> 01:07:31.600
You can't stop this world
from changing.

01:07:31.683 --> 01:07:33.100
I can try.

01:07:33.767 --> 01:07:38.058
I've decided to run as a
Conservative candidate for the Senate.

01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:39.975
What do you think?

01:07:40.267 --> 01:07:41.475
Politicians are just...

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.267
bandit and criminals.

01:08:11.017 --> 01:08:13.850
Can't we close one of
the windows?

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.308
Ferula is dead.

01:10:07.475 --> 01:10:08.933
But it's impossible!

01:10:09.475 --> 01:10:13.433
I saw her 2 days ago and
she was perfectly well.

01:10:13.933 --> 01:10:15.100
I know it's true.

01:10:31.808 --> 01:10:32.600
Please,

01:10:36.058 --> 01:10:38.183
Leave me alone with her.

01:10:56.142 --> 01:10:59.475
If you only knew
how much we miss you,

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.850
Blanca and l.

01:11:04.767 --> 01:11:07.308
We talk of you almost every day.

01:11:17.183 --> 01:11:19.100
You'd be so proud of Blanca.

01:11:21.975 --> 01:11:24.475
Esteban has sent her lover away,

01:11:25.517 --> 01:11:28.392
but they meet secretly
by the river.

01:11:32.808 --> 01:11:35.600
She is do brave,

01:11:36.683 --> 01:11:37.683
and strong,

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.600
and true to her feelings.

01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:48.975
I'll always remember you.

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.683
Till we meet again.

01:12:21.475 --> 01:12:22.767
All of you!

01:12:24.183 --> 01:12:26.308
You have a right to speak up
and make demands!

01:12:27.058 --> 01:12:29.933
To stand up against
your oppressors!

01:12:31.392 --> 01:12:35.642
The landowners depend you,
because you make the wheels spin.

01:12:36.267 --> 01:12:37.558
You do the work.

01:12:38.267 --> 01:12:40.308
You make it possible for them
to live in comfort!

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:44.517
You've a right to join unions!

01:12:46.683 --> 01:12:51.017
That's why you should make demands,
form unions and organize!

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:54.808
If you stop working,

01:12:55.767 --> 01:12:57.392
there will be no more patrons!

01:13:20.392 --> 01:13:24.808
If I set eyes on you again,
I'll blow your brains out?

01:13:24.975 --> 01:13:25.808
Do you hear?

01:14:40.725 --> 01:14:41.933
Excuse me for...

01:14:42.475 --> 01:14:43.725
I was...

01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:46.392
I was down by the river
and I couldn't sleep.

01:14:47.017 --> 01:14:48.475
I went for a walk by the river,

01:14:49.183 --> 01:14:50.892
and I saw them.

01:14:51.933 --> 01:14:55.850
I saw my future bride
lying naked.

01:14:56.475 --> 01:14:58.058
Naked in the arms of...

01:14:58.475 --> 01:15:00.558
Who? Tell me! Who was it?

01:15:01.808 --> 01:15:02.392
Tell me!

01:15:03.725 --> 01:15:04.767
That Indian.

01:15:05.475 --> 01:15:07.058
The revolutionary.

01:15:07.142 --> 01:15:07.933
I'll kill him!

01:15:08.808 --> 01:15:10.225
I'll kill that bastard!

01:15:24.475 --> 01:15:25.475
Where is he?

01:15:27.433 --> 01:15:28.308
Tell me!

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:32.017
Where is he? Tell me where he is!
I'll kill him.

01:15:32.267 --> 01:15:33.475
Where is he?

01:15:33.933 --> 01:15:35.392
I'll never tell you!

01:15:35.558 --> 01:15:36.392
Never!

01:15:36.475 --> 01:15:37.225
I'll kill him!

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:39.433
You tell me where he is!

01:15:55.767 --> 01:15:57.267
Open up these gates!

01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:12.808
This is your fault!!

01:16:13.017 --> 01:16:14.308
You brought her up without morals,

01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:19.475
without religion or principles.
She has no idea who she is!

01:16:19.683 --> 01:16:20.975
She's my daughter.

01:16:21.642 --> 01:16:25.100
If she did this with someone from
a decent family, I'd understand.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.350
But with that scumbag,
that sneaky...

01:16:28.808 --> 01:16:30.642
son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill him!

01:16:30.683 --> 01:16:33.308
I swear on my mother's soul
he'll wish he's never been...

01:16:33.933 --> 01:16:37.433
Pedro's done nothing
you haven't done.

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:41.392
You've also slept with women
not of your own class.

01:16:42.975 --> 01:16:46.142
But he did it for love,
and so did Blanca.

01:16:53.433 --> 01:16:54.517
My angel.

01:16:56.142 --> 01:16:56.767
Come on.

01:16:57.683 --> 01:16:58.558
Come.

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:06.975
Come on.

01:17:19.517 --> 01:17:21.475
I'll never speak to you again.

01:17:26.933 --> 01:17:27.975
Never!

01:17:40.683 --> 01:17:42.350
We move to...

01:17:42.683 --> 01:17:44.558
my parent's house in town.

01:17:48.558 --> 01:17:50.642
We'll all miss you.

01:18:00.267 --> 01:18:01.267
I shall miss you,

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.683
too.

01:18:33.142 --> 01:18:34.183
I'm leaving, Patron.

01:18:37.225 --> 01:18:37.933
Why?

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:44.058
I don't want to be here
when you catch up with my son.

01:19:04.267 --> 01:19:05.433
Have you found him?

01:19:05.975 --> 01:19:08.058
Not yet, but we're still looking.

01:19:08.642 --> 01:19:12.392
I want him myself. I'll offer a
reward, I don't care how much.

01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:14.683
Why do you take it so personally?

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:15.933
It is personal!

01:19:16.183 --> 01:19:16.892
I must warn you,

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.058
I know the laws of this country.

01:19:36.642 --> 01:19:38.725
What are you doing? I'm eating!

01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:41.892
I know where Pedro's hiding.

01:19:45.433 --> 01:19:46.267
How do you know?

01:19:47.475 --> 01:19:49.058
Will you give me the reward,

01:19:50.017 --> 01:19:51.267
Patron?

01:19:53.642 --> 01:19:54.808
How do you know?

01:19:58.642 --> 01:20:00.683
Everybody know where he's hiding,

01:20:02.142 --> 01:20:02.892
except you.

01:20:04.392 --> 01:20:07.017
Show me, so I know you're
not lying.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.017
You'll give me the reward, Patron?

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:30.975
Take care of the horses.

01:22:19.975 --> 01:22:21.808
Telegram for you, senor.

01:22:31.142 --> 01:22:32.642
The reward.

01:22:35.225 --> 01:22:36.683
Squealers don't get rewards.

01:23:20.267 --> 01:23:21.725
You're marrying my daughter.

01:23:22.392 --> 01:23:23.142
What?

01:23:23.683 --> 01:23:25.725
I mean what I say.

01:23:25.975 --> 01:23:26.725
Whisky.

01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:32.433
I had a telegram saying she was
pregnant, so you're marrying her.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.100
But it's not me, it's that Indian,

01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:36.642
that revolutionary.

01:23:36.725 --> 01:23:40.850
What are you talking about?
Must be something you dreamt.

01:23:41.308 --> 01:23:42.350
There's a misunderstanding.

01:23:42.683 --> 01:23:47.350
I know what kind of man you are.
I'm not a fool.

01:23:49.308 --> 01:23:51.683
So we're going to make a deal.

01:23:52.433 --> 01:23:56.142
I'm offering you what you've
always been after. My money.

01:23:57.017 --> 01:24:01.308
Just so my grandchild can bear
your idiotic name!

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.683
You understand?

01:24:13.433 --> 01:24:15.892
- Where's your mother?
- She doesn't want to see you.

01:24:17.267 --> 01:24:18.850
I found you a husband.

01:24:18.975 --> 01:24:21.850
- A father for your bastard.
- I'm not getting married.

01:24:22.475 --> 01:24:24.600
Yes, you are. You'll marry him.

01:24:25.183 --> 01:24:26.767
I'm going to be a senator.

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.642
I don't want a bastard
in the family.

01:24:30.725 --> 01:24:32.392
I thought we already had several.

01:24:33.767 --> 01:24:35.725
Besides,
I'm in love with someone else.

01:24:36.683 --> 01:24:39.517
You should know
Pedro Segundo is dead.

01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:42.933
I killed him.

01:24:43.433 --> 01:24:46.642
So it would be best if you forget
about him right away.

01:24:56.683 --> 01:24:59.392
Would you please ask
my husband and his friend...

01:24:59.475 --> 01:25:02.225
to leave my house immediately?

01:25:02.517 --> 01:25:05.642
Sir, I'm afraid I have
to ask you to leave the house.

01:25:27.058 --> 01:25:29.183
God, how I hate Papa.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.183
Don't cry my love.

01:25:38.267 --> 01:25:40.517
Too many tears will hurt the baby...

01:25:41.558 --> 01:25:43.058
and make her unhappy.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:46.267
I could kill him.

01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.392
You should never seek revenge,
it does no one any good.

01:25:52.517 --> 01:25:53.475
Besides...

01:25:54.392 --> 01:25:55.850
Pedro is still alive.

01:25:57.850 --> 01:25:59.058
How do you know?

01:26:01.058 --> 01:26:02.183
I dreamed it.

01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:08.558
You won't see him now
for a very long time...

01:26:09.683 --> 01:26:10.892
because he has to hide.

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:14.475
He can't come out until
the world has changed.

01:26:20.517 --> 01:26:21.558
I'm so...

01:26:22.267 --> 01:26:24.892
proud of you
for not getting married.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.392
Why did you marry Papa?

01:26:31.683 --> 01:26:33.225
Because I love him.

01:26:34.475 --> 01:26:36.183
Oh, I did.

01:26:36.767 --> 01:26:38.767
I was fascinated by him.

01:26:41.433 --> 01:26:42.558
He was strong...

01:26:43.475 --> 01:26:44.933
and courageous.

01:26:48.558 --> 01:26:51.808
He's just been fighting
all of his live.

01:26:53.725 --> 01:26:54.933
But you must know...

01:26:57.850 --> 01:27:01.767
nothing your Papa does
comes from malice.

01:27:03.308 --> 01:27:06.017
He just has too much energy.

01:27:11.433 --> 01:27:13.267
And still love him.

01:27:16.683 --> 01:27:18.017
I do.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.933
He is my life...

01:27:26.308 --> 01:27:27.767
just like you are.

01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:40.183
To uphold those values...

01:27:41.475 --> 01:27:44.225
that all right-thinking
people embrace...

01:28:19.433 --> 01:28:21.267
You don't want
to go to the hotel?

01:28:25.642 --> 01:28:27.600
Would you rather
go home to Tres Marias?

01:28:30.267 --> 01:28:33.975
No, just...
drive around for a while.

01:28:36.892 --> 01:28:38.725
I'll tell you.

01:30:02.642 --> 01:30:03.350
I'm sorry.

01:30:04.933 --> 01:30:06.308
The door was open. I...

01:30:08.975 --> 01:30:09.767
Forgive me.

01:30:17.142 --> 01:30:18.517
Forgive me for...

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.517
everything I've done to you.

01:30:25.392 --> 01:30:27.475
Forgive me for
what I've done to Blanca.

01:30:33.892 --> 01:30:35.017
Forgive me, Clara.

01:30:38.808 --> 01:30:41.767
I'd like to stay here
with you for a while...

01:30:42.475 --> 01:30:44.058
if you don't mind.

01:31:07.142 --> 01:31:10.017
I don't want to go back
to Tres Marias.

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:15.725
I miss you so.

01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:22.058
I miss our family.

01:31:28.475 --> 01:31:30.183
You don't have to talk.

01:31:32.433 --> 01:31:34.808
Just let me stay here with you.

01:31:40.642 --> 01:31:41.683
It occurred to me...

01:31:44.392 --> 01:31:45.975
I'm a grandfather..

01:31:50.933 --> 01:31:53.267
And I've never
seen my granddaughter.

01:32:25.392 --> 01:32:26.183
Come on.

01:32:26.642 --> 01:32:30.433
Blow them all out in one breath,
one big breath.

01:32:36.433 --> 01:32:38.808
One candle left, Alba.

01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:42.350
So you have a secret sweetheart.

01:32:42.725 --> 01:32:44.517
Are you going to tell us who it is?
Tell Mummy.

01:32:46.725 --> 01:32:47.975
It's, Grandpa!

01:32:48.017 --> 01:32:51.600
Let's not make Grandma jealous.
Sit down and we'll eat the cake.

01:32:51.683 --> 01:32:53.892
Have you heard the latest polls?

01:32:54.058 --> 01:32:56.017
I wouldn't worry about them.

01:32:57.017 --> 01:32:58.642
It's always like that.

01:32:59.475 --> 01:33:01.433
I think we'll have
the best results ever.

01:33:01.725 --> 01:33:03.058
Good for the Country.

01:33:03.225 --> 01:33:05.225
We mustn't underestimate
the opposition.

01:33:05.892 --> 01:33:09.142
I don't know how anyone can
take the opposition seriously.

01:33:10.308 --> 01:33:12.142
Dreamers, romantics.

01:33:12.267 --> 01:33:13.267
Eat up your cake, sweetheart.

01:33:14.267 --> 01:33:17.892
When did the Left ever win
a democratic election?

01:33:19.808 --> 01:33:20.808
Never!

01:33:21.017 --> 01:33:22.850
Even a child could see...

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:27.058
that the Left are
the enemies of democracy.

01:33:27.392 --> 01:33:28.558
Look at history.

01:33:28.725 --> 01:33:32.308
When were revolutionaries
ever freely elected to power?

01:33:32.475 --> 01:33:35.058
- It's so easy for you.
- I know what I'm saying.

01:33:35.517 --> 01:33:37.058
I know what this country needs.

01:33:37.142 --> 01:33:40.183
If it was up to you Papa,
nothing would ever change, nothing.

01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:45.392
You see things only in black or white,
survival of the fittest.

01:33:45.767 --> 01:33:47.975
- That's the law of nature.
- It's the law of the jungle.

01:33:48.517 --> 01:33:50.267
You are so primitive.

01:33:50.475 --> 01:33:53.767
Your world is so small,
so infinitely small.

01:33:54.892 --> 01:33:58.433
Blanca, my dear,
you're a true Utopian.

01:33:58.642 --> 01:33:59.850
That world doesn’t exist.

01:34:00.058 --> 01:34:02.642
Would you kindly ask my
husband to respect the fact...

01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:05.308
it's my granddaughter's birthday?

01:34:08.017 --> 01:34:08.683
I'm to ask you...

01:34:08.892 --> 01:34:09.558
I'm sorry, Clara.

01:34:10.142 --> 01:34:14.558
Would you ask my husband to make sure
our guests have something to drink?

01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:19.433
Would you like
a little cognac liquor?

01:34:21.225 --> 01:34:22.225
Blanca, liqueur?

01:34:22.808 --> 01:34:25.267
Cognac, please.
I'll see who it is.

01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:37.600
- Who are you?
- I want to see Senator Trueba.

01:34:38.558 --> 01:34:39.892
The Senator is busy.

01:34:44.183 --> 01:34:44.975
Are you Blanca?

01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:48.058
Yes, I am.

01:34:52.808 --> 01:34:54.725
Haven't I see somewhere before?

01:35:01.517 --> 01:35:02.642
Who are you?

01:35:03.475 --> 01:35:05.017
I'm a relative of the Senator.

01:35:08.808 --> 01:35:09.933
Wait here.

01:35:23.725 --> 01:35:24.683
Excuse me.

01:35:31.475 --> 01:35:33.850
What all this about you
being a relative of mine?

01:35:34.475 --> 01:35:36.142
Don't you remember me...

01:35:36.933 --> 01:35:37.642
Patron?

01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:42.392
What do you want?

01:35:43.933 --> 01:35:45.350
Hurry up, I have visitors.

01:35:45.767 --> 01:35:48.558
I want to join the army and
I need money for my education.

01:35:49.975 --> 01:35:51.308
You should've stayed in the country.

01:35:51.725 --> 01:35:52.642
Well...

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.017
You still owe me that reward.

01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:56.308
Yes, I know.

01:35:58.433 --> 01:36:01.392
I'll call the Military Academy
in the morning.

01:36:04.142 --> 01:36:05.767
I know the people there.

01:36:06.517 --> 01:36:07.558
They'll give you a scholarship.

01:36:13.683 --> 01:36:14.308
Get out.

01:36:16.933 --> 01:36:19.142
Don't bother me again.

01:36:23.392 --> 01:36:25.183
CONSERVATIVE PARTY

01:36:36.558 --> 01:36:40.267
It seems people voted
differently this time.

01:36:40.975 --> 01:36:43.100
Have the Conservatives lost?

01:36:43.433 --> 01:36:44.350
Not at all!

01:36:44.808 --> 01:36:46.517
We shall win.
The country shall win.

01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:49.225
I believe in people's common sense.

01:36:49.767 --> 01:36:51.642
The tide seems
to have turned against you.

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:54.350
We are the defenders
of your democracy.

01:36:55.183 --> 01:36:56.392
We'll win again.

01:36:56.933 --> 01:36:59.600
Papa, you stubborn old fool!

01:37:00.142 --> 01:37:01.808
Let's just wait for the results.
Then we can celebrate.

01:37:29.475 --> 01:37:30.558
I think...

01:37:31.517 --> 01:37:33.725
we now have the final results.

01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:39.058
While we are waiting
for the results...

01:37:40.267 --> 01:37:42.225
They are still counting...

01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:43.392
the last votes.

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:51.517
The opposition, the People's Front,
has won an overwhelming victory.

01:37:53.558 --> 01:37:54.933
We won! We won!

01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:57.100
Mama, we won!

01:38:04.142 --> 01:38:06.683
After being in power for generations,
the Conservatives have lost,

01:38:07.142 --> 01:38:10.433
rejected by voters.

01:38:11.225 --> 01:38:13.975
This is a sensational
for the People’s Front.

01:38:14.808 --> 01:38:19.433
People once called subversives,
revolutionaries, enemies of the state,

01:38:20.058 --> 01:38:21.767
are openly celebrating tonight.

01:38:36.725 --> 01:38:37.642
Just a moment.

01:38:39.767 --> 01:38:40.433
Telephone.

01:38:53.850 --> 01:38:54.558
Who is it?

01:39:14.892 --> 01:39:16.725
Where are you?

01:42:14.808 --> 01:42:17.600
Alba, this is a very good
friend of mine.

01:42:17.767 --> 01:42:19.475
Say hello nicely.

01:42:21.433 --> 01:42:22.142
Let's sit down.

01:42:50.892 --> 01:42:52.392
Want to come with me?

01:42:55.392 --> 01:42:56.142
All right.

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:28.975
These are my old angels wings,

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:30.933
my mother made for me.

01:43:34.558 --> 01:43:36.017
Take around here.

01:43:39.267 --> 01:43:41.850
There's no food, no clothes, shoes,

01:43:43.017 --> 01:43:45.392
no spare parts, nothing.

01:43:45.558 --> 01:43:48.850
You're a bad loser.
You know who's behind the strikes.

01:43:48.933 --> 01:43:51.308
Everybody knows. It's sabotage.

01:43:51.808 --> 01:43:53.142
They're taking Tres Marias.

01:43:54.058 --> 01:43:55.308
Everything I've worked for,

01:43:56.392 --> 01:43:57.558
they'll give it away...

01:43:58.100 --> 01:43:59.517
to the people.

01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:03.558
- My property!
- We'll be all right.

01:44:06.058 --> 01:44:07.142
Something must be done.

01:44:08.142 --> 01:44:08.933
Quickly.

01:44:09.475 --> 01:44:13.308
- Back to the solution to our problems.
- You don't understand.

01:44:13.433 --> 01:44:15.642
More police, more mad generals.

01:44:15.808 --> 01:44:17.892
Why do you say they're
mad generals?

01:44:18.517 --> 01:44:21.142
They just care about their country,
same as I do.

01:44:22.017 --> 01:44:24.017
They want to put order back.

01:44:38.183 --> 01:44:39.058
Grandma!

01:44:56.475 --> 01:44:58.975
I think I need to lie down
in my calm,

01:44:59.767 --> 01:45:02.350
blue sea of silk.

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.350
Are you very ill, Grandma?

01:45:06.392 --> 01:45:09.642
I think I'm beginning
to leave this world, my love.

01:45:14.267 --> 01:45:16.975
But you mustn't be afraid
of death, Alba.

01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:24.017
Dying is just a change,
like being born.

01:45:26.642 --> 01:45:31.267
You know I've always been in touch
with the spirits on the other side.

01:45:32.725 --> 01:45:34.017
And when I get there,

01:45:35.267 --> 01:45:37.100
I'll be in touch with you,

01:45:39.017 --> 01:45:40.725
and all the others.

01:45:43.433 --> 01:45:44.683
Dou you understand?

01:45:54.933 --> 01:45:57.017
Please, give these to your mother.

01:45:57.933 --> 01:45:59.225
They'll help her...

01:46:01.517 --> 01:46:03.350
reclaim the past.

01:46:04.808 --> 01:46:06.017
Maybe they'll...

01:46:07.058 --> 01:46:08.392
help her...

01:46:09.267 --> 01:46:10.267
to see...

01:46:11.850 --> 01:46:15.933
the relationship between
events more clearly.

01:46:19.517 --> 01:46:22.642
And some day she may need these...

01:46:25.475 --> 01:46:26.850
for something other...

01:46:28.308 --> 01:46:30.475
than adornment.

01:47:12.183 --> 01:47:13.433
Tell Grandpa...

01:47:17.558 --> 01:47:22.142
Tell Grandpa I promise I will...

01:47:24.892 --> 01:47:26.392
come back and fetch him.

01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:20.142
Darling!

01:48:22.433 --> 01:48:23.475
What's that?

01:48:24.017 --> 01:48:25.933
Grandmother's dead.

01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:36.517
What?

01:51:59.392 --> 01:52:01.517
It's hard to survey the situation.

01:52:01.975 --> 01:52:03.683
Events are developing rapidly.

01:52:03.933 --> 01:52:07.350
The new democratically-elected
government is under attack.

01:52:07.975 --> 01:52:12.475
Armed units are under the command
of officers sympathetic to the coup.

01:52:13.017 --> 01:52:16.725
Rumor says the Conservative Party
stands behind the coup.

01:52:17.267 --> 01:52:21.017
And will take control after
the military brings order.

01:52:22.017 --> 01:52:24.975
The country is now controlled
by the armed forces.

01:52:25.142 --> 01:52:26.350
To the country!

01:52:43.058 --> 01:52:43.642
Shit!

01:52:44.683 --> 01:52:45.558
Let's go!

01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:48.142
Let's go! Come on!

01:53:13.767 --> 01:53:15.975
You cover the back.
We'll stay here.

01:53:18.975 --> 01:53:19.725
Senator!

01:53:21.475 --> 01:53:22.558
What's going on?

01:53:23.267 --> 01:53:24.392
We'd like to see your daughter.

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:26.267
My daughter?

01:53:26.933 --> 01:53:30.267
She's suspected of subversive acts.
We have an arrest warrant.

01:53:31.642 --> 01:53:32.600
Are you mad?

01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:38.433
It's a mistake!
Let me see the warrant.

01:53:39.308 --> 01:53:41.683
Everything will be all right.
I'll be back soon.

01:53:46.183 --> 01:53:47.058
Come with me.

01:53:53.183 --> 01:53:54.433
This is a mistake.

01:53:56.142 --> 01:53:57.225
I'm Senator Trueba.

01:53:57.975 --> 01:53:59.142
Don't you recognize me?

01:54:02.142 --> 01:54:02.933
For God's sake!

01:54:03.017 --> 01:54:03.767
Shut up!

01:54:04.517 --> 01:54:05.892
In my own house!

01:54:06.642 --> 01:54:07.517
Just shut up!

01:54:09.517 --> 01:54:10.933
You old fool!

01:54:16.142 --> 01:54:19.183
Your daughter is going with
Pedro Segundo, a revolutionary!

01:54:21.725 --> 01:54:24.642
My father is a very old man.

01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:27.558
May I have a moment
alone with him,

01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:30.058
to say goodbye?

01:54:30.975 --> 01:54:32.308
Please?

01:54:45.308 --> 01:54:46.600
Papa, listen to me.

01:54:48.183 --> 01:54:49.100
Pedro's here.

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:51.808
He's in the cellar.

01:54:56.225 --> 01:54:59.683
If they find him, they'll kill him.
Do you understand?

01:54:59.850 --> 01:55:02.892
These men are dangerous.
They can kill me,

01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:05.850
the can kill you.
They can kill all of us.

01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:09.308
You know what love is like.

01:55:09.933 --> 01:55:13.017
I love Pedro the way
you loved Mama.

01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:16.558
He's my entire life.

01:55:17.808 --> 01:55:19.600
And he's Alba's father.

01:55:20.433 --> 01:55:23.683
You have influential friends.
Help him if you can.

01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:25.975
Help him get out of the country.

01:55:29.558 --> 01:55:32.642
Don't make your grandchild
fatherless.

01:55:33.975 --> 01:55:36.017
Do you hear me? I beg you...

01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:38.642
Let Alba keep her father.

01:55:40.058 --> 01:55:41.475
She needs him.

01:55:42.142 --> 01:55:43.392
She needs him.

01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:53.600
They won't touch you.

01:55:54.683 --> 01:55:55.933
Don't be afraid, my love.

01:55:56.017 --> 01:55:57.433
I'll see the Minister.

01:55:57.808 --> 01:55:58.850
Everything is a mistake.

01:56:00.142 --> 01:56:01.183
Don't be afraid!

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:07.225
Keep your hands still!

01:56:08.892 --> 01:56:09.475
Come on.

01:56:46.308 --> 01:56:47.600
You, hold up there!

01:56:51.808 --> 01:56:52.683
Where are you going?

01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:54.683
Where are you taking her?

01:58:02.517 --> 01:58:04.058
Good evening, Blanca.

01:58:13.017 --> 01:58:14.350
We'd like you to tell us...

01:58:14.517 --> 01:58:16.808
where your lover is.

01:58:23.642 --> 01:58:25.142
I want to go to the toilet.

01:58:33.683 --> 01:58:35.683
It'd be wise to cooperate.

01:58:37.975 --> 01:58:39.433
I want to go to the toilet.

01:59:07.767 --> 01:59:09.392
Stop there.

01:59:11.392 --> 01:59:13.392
- Show your papers.
- Trueba, for the Minister.

01:59:13.475 --> 01:59:15.100
Very well, carry on.

01:59:38.767 --> 01:59:39.475
You there!

01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:41.725
What? Leave me alone!

01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:58.350
Get out of the way!

01:59:59.183 --> 02:00:01.558
- Stand clear!
- I'm Senator Trueba!

02:00:02.142 --> 02:00:03.808
I demand to see the Minister.

02:00:04.017 --> 02:00:04.725
Sit down!

02:00:05.558 --> 02:00:07.892
Now! Sit down!

02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:25.808
You can go in.

02:00:49.183 --> 02:00:51.808
Why was my daughter
arrested last night?

02:00:54.850 --> 02:00:56.850
Answer me!
Where is my daughter?

02:00:59.308 --> 02:01:00.683
Let me have your car keys.

02:01:02.808 --> 02:01:06.600
Congress is shut down and your
congressional privileges impounded.

02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:16.642
You're all out of your minds.

02:01:19.850 --> 02:01:23.808
Who do you think established
contact with your generals,

02:01:24.683 --> 02:01:27.642
Who forged the link with
the Americans,

02:01:28.933 --> 02:01:30.308
whose money and reputation...

02:01:32.392 --> 02:01:34.225
guaranteed you weapons?

02:01:35.433 --> 02:01:37.142
Do you know who I am?

02:01:38.767 --> 02:01:40.225
And then you arrest my daughter...

02:01:41.142 --> 02:01:42.975
and want to confiscate my car.

02:01:43.767 --> 02:01:45.142
Let me see the Minister.

02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:47.392
Deal with me.

02:01:47.517 --> 02:01:48.433
I must see the Minister!

02:01:48.850 --> 02:01:50.183
There is no Minister!

02:01:54.225 --> 02:01:55.225
You deal with me now.

02:01:56.267 --> 02:01:57.308
Understand?

02:02:01.642 --> 02:02:03.267
You want to find your daughter?

02:02:03.767 --> 02:02:04.725
Fill in the forms.

02:02:09.392 --> 02:02:12.892
You and your friends still
have economic power.

02:02:13.517 --> 02:02:15.642
But we run the country.

02:02:16.767 --> 02:02:17.683
Now...

02:02:18.933 --> 02:02:20.850
give me the car keys.

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:18.558
Who are you?

02:03:23.892 --> 02:03:25.892
You'd better start talking to me.

02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:32.392
I know your voice.

02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:39.017
Who are you?

02:03:51.433 --> 02:03:52.600
I want to use the toilet.

02:04:00.892 --> 02:04:02.892
Start talking, you hear me?

02:04:02.975 --> 02:04:05.600
- I've nothing to tell you, bastard!
- Talk to me now.

02:04:05.683 --> 02:04:09.392
I've nothing to tell you, you bastard!

02:04:14.933 --> 02:04:16.517
Who are you?

02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:18.350
You want to know who I am?

02:04:19.933 --> 02:04:22.600
You want to know who I am?

02:04:33.017 --> 02:04:34.850
You smell good.

02:04:41.475 --> 02:04:42.600
Can you imagine?

02:04:43.267 --> 02:04:46.225
We have the same blood
in our veins.

02:05:02.808 --> 02:05:04.100
There's nobody.

02:05:06.308 --> 02:05:07.600
I can't find anybody who...

02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:09.475
can...

02:05:10.142 --> 02:05:11.017
or will...

02:05:11.267 --> 02:05:12.892
help me find my daughter.

02:05:15.017 --> 02:05:17.683
You're an important
person now, Transito.

02:05:19.017 --> 02:05:20.558
You know everybody.

02:05:20.683 --> 02:05:22.392
They all come here.

02:05:25.808 --> 02:05:27.433
For old time's sake,

02:05:31.392 --> 02:05:33.058
please,

02:05:34.017 --> 02:05:35.475
help me find my daughter.

02:05:35.933 --> 02:05:38.725
I still owe you a favour, Patron.

02:05:42.850 --> 02:05:47.058
This man cannot judge what is good
for himself or for others.

02:05:47.767 --> 02:05:49.558
You should eat something.

02:05:50.767 --> 02:05:53.642
This man will desecrate the past
of our beloved people.

02:05:54.142 --> 02:05:56.350
Erode our proud traditions.

02:06:00.267 --> 02:06:03.225
Like mites and parasites,
these evil forces...

02:06:05.058 --> 02:06:06.517
Will Mummy be back soon?

02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:17.350
How could I be so wrong?

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:23.808
How could I be so wrong?

02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:28.100
This is Esteban Trueba.
I'd like to speak to the Ambassador.

02:06:34.475 --> 02:06:35.100
John!

02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:39.892
No, not well, John.

02:06:41.058 --> 02:06:45.100
How can one feel well these days?
It's terrible what's happening.

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:46.392
I feel...

02:06:47.308 --> 02:06:50.017
personally ashamed.

02:06:50.642 --> 02:06:52.642
I feel everything is my fault.

02:06:53.767 --> 02:06:57.392
But I didn't call for sympathy.
I need your help.

02:06:57.892 --> 02:06:59.183
For old time's sake.

02:07:01.142 --> 02:07:03.350
I realize what I'm about
to ask is beyond...

02:07:04.308 --> 02:07:06.767
what diplomacy permits.

02:07:07.892 --> 02:07:08.850
And it's dangerous.

02:07:09.183 --> 02:07:10.142
Very dangerous.

02:07:10.267 --> 02:07:13.850
But there's someone
I need to help.

02:07:43.642 --> 02:07:45.267
I've come to take you out of here.

02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:50.225
Why?

02:07:53.642 --> 02:07:55.100
Because you're not safe here.

02:07:59.017 --> 02:08:00.017
Go to hell!

02:08:01.725 --> 02:08:03.683
Please, come with me.

02:08:08.683 --> 02:08:09.558
Please.

02:08:29.850 --> 02:08:31.475
CANADIAN EMBASSY

02:08:32.892 --> 02:08:35.767
Senator Trueba
to see the Ambassador.

02:08:38.225 --> 02:08:39.225
Your papers?

02:08:57.933 --> 02:08:59.017
Search the trunk!

02:09:06.767 --> 02:09:09.100
Please, step out of the car.

02:09:10.225 --> 02:09:11.392
We must search it.

02:09:14.225 --> 02:09:15.100
Get out of the car!

02:09:22.725 --> 02:09:24.058
Stay where you are,

02:09:25.225 --> 02:09:26.725
you old civilist fool.

02:09:34.058 --> 02:09:35.100
It's clean.

02:09:43.433 --> 02:09:45.308
You can open it. Open the gate!

02:11:12.975 --> 02:11:14.225
She doesn't respond anymore.

02:12:22.933 --> 02:12:24.767
You must not wish for death,

02:12:24.850 --> 02:12:25.975
my child.

02:12:29.683 --> 02:12:31.767
That's not what's important.

02:12:33.517 --> 02:12:36.308
Death will come no matter what.

02:12:38.808 --> 02:12:41.600
You must fight to live...

02:12:43.142 --> 02:12:45.308
for life is a miracle.

02:12:54.725 --> 02:12:56.975
And Alba needs you.

02:12:58.808 --> 02:13:00.642
She's waiting for you.

02:13:33.933 --> 02:13:34.933
Who's this?

02:13:39.808 --> 02:13:40.850
You did?

02:13:46.350 --> 02:13:47.850
Thank you, Transito.

02:14:03.558 --> 02:14:07.475
Remember the curfew.
Don't move till sunrise.

02:15:23.892 --> 02:15:26.558
What have they done to you, my child?

02:15:48.017 --> 02:15:50.267
I thought I'd never see you again.

02:15:58.308 --> 02:16:01.267
I thought I'd die
alone and miserable,

02:16:03.058 --> 02:16:04.058
Like Ferula said.

02:16:10.892 --> 02:16:12.517
Is Pedro...?

02:16:15.058 --> 02:16:16.308
Safe.

02:16:19.683 --> 02:16:20.642
Safe.

02:16:33.433 --> 02:16:35.308
He's waiting for you in Canada.

02:16:51.183 --> 02:16:53.433
Let's hope he's a better father
than I was.

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:59.058
You did your best.

02:17:01.558 --> 02:17:04.308
I was once very angry with you.

02:17:06.017 --> 02:17:07.308
I even hated you.

02:17:09.850 --> 02:17:11.267
You know about that.

02:17:14.058 --> 02:17:17.767
While I was in prison,
I thought only of revenge,

02:17:18.850 --> 02:17:19.892
not on you,

02:17:20.558 --> 02:17:24.017
but I was obsessed by
thoughts of revenge.

02:17:24.183 --> 02:17:27.267
I would avenge all those
who should be avenged.

02:17:30.683 --> 02:17:34.267
But now I'm not so sure
of my hatred.

02:17:37.558 --> 02:17:40.017
I've begun to realize
there must be...

02:17:41.017 --> 02:17:44.850
a relationship between events,
like Mama always said.

02:18:21.725 --> 02:18:22.475
It's good to be back.

02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:50.642
What is it?

02:18:51.308 --> 02:18:52.767
I miss Clara.

02:18:58.517 --> 02:19:00.142
Come on. Come and lie down.

02:19:05.142 --> 02:19:06.308
Thank you, Blanca dear.

02:19:11.017 --> 02:19:11.767
There.

02:19:13.892 --> 02:19:15.392
That's better now.

02:19:24.558 --> 02:19:26.100
Go now, Blanca.

02:19:32.433 --> 02:19:33.892
Go to Alba.

02:20:11.767 --> 02:20:12.975
Clara.

02:20:27.683 --> 02:20:29.183
My dearest.

02:20:35.517 --> 02:20:37.392
My angel.

02:21:10.517 --> 02:21:14.392
My mother wrote everything down
to keep track of time.

02:21:15.975 --> 02:21:20.642
What she wrote in her diaries
has helped me overcome my terrors.

02:21:24.433 --> 02:21:27.600
And today I ask myself
if I want to contribute...

02:21:28.308 --> 02:21:32.433
to the endless story of
hatred, blood and revenge.

02:21:35.975 --> 02:21:38.600
But I can 't find a reason
for that anymore.

02:21:41.225 --> 02:21:42.725
To me, life is...

02:21:43.933 --> 02:21:45.058
my daughter,

02:21:46.433 --> 02:21:47.433
Pedro,

02:21:48.850 --> 02:21:49.683
the light,

02:21:50.475 --> 02:21:51.475
the day,

02:21:52.475 --> 02:21:54.142
this very moment,

02:21:55.933 --> 02:21:57.142
the memories,

02:21:58.433 --> 02:21:59.517
the future.

02:22:01.267 --> 02:22:05.600
To me, life itself has become
the most important thing.
