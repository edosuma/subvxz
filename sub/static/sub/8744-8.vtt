in the Enochian Tablets.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.726
- Enochian?
- Mm-hm.

33:48.893 --> 33:53.888

34:04.142 --> 34:08.340
I checked with a Professor Falconer at NYU.
and he said that the Enochian lexicon...

...is the language of wizards,
of prophets, of, uh-- Of hierophants.

are part of the Vorschlag art collection.
