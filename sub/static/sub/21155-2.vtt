WEBVTT

00:00.918 --> 00:02.033
- Previously on "Killjoys"...

00:02.587 --> 00:05.078
Aneela, she's your daughter?
- Yes.

00:05.590 --> 00:07.376
- Why do I look like her?

00:07.383 --> 00:08.338
- I don't know.

00:09.677 --> 00:10.792
- Cloaked Hullen ships.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.339
Hiding here?

00:12.346 --> 00:14.428
- Not hiding, waiting.

00:14.432 --> 00:16.388
- That arm belongs to
a missing friend of mine.

00:16.392 --> 00:18.724
So either the arm comes with me
or you both do.

00:21.606 --> 00:24.313
So whatever Clara came for,
she didn't find it.

00:24.317 --> 00:25.773
- No Basics in, no Basics out.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.562
- Mod him.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.356
- I am the greatest man
who ever lived.

00:30.740 --> 00:34.073
He's not a no-face.
He's a two-face.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.782
Ollie?

00:41.751 --> 00:43.457
First you're gonna fix her.

00:43.461 --> 00:44.541
Then you're gonna tell me
why you set us up.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.331
And then I'm gonna kill you.

00:46.339 --> 00:47.875
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.706
Wait.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.458
All I ever did was
ask about her missing friend,

00:52.470 --> 00:53.630
like I promised.

00:53.638 --> 00:55.424
Everything you know about me,

00:55.431 --> 00:57.012
do you really think
I'd betray a hackmod?

01:00.394 --> 01:01.725
- No.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.311
- Go.
Help her.

01:09.487 --> 01:11.102
- Talk to me.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.650
If there's repo in town,
I have to warn people.

01:13.658 --> 01:14.613
- Yeah?

01:21.123 --> 01:24.411
- You warn them some weird
shit's going on in Rat City.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.632
- J‘ It's a feeling

01:37.640 --> 01:40.632
J“ lrrepressible

01:40.643 --> 01:42.804
J” It's a hunger

01:42.812 --> 01:45.349
J” Insatiable

01:46.857 --> 01:47.812
What's wrong?

01:48.859 --> 01:49.814
- Your face.

01:53.823 --> 01:55.859
- Don't look at me like that.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.072
I said don't look at me!

02:02.832 --> 02:05.619
- J‘ Ooh, ooh

02:05.626 --> 02:06.661
J“ Ooh, ooh

02:07.962 --> 02:11.546
J‘ Ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh J‘

02:11.549 --> 02:13.460
J“ Ooh, ooh

02:15.428 --> 02:18.420
- So how was your holocall
with Johnny last night?

02:18.431 --> 02:19.546
- Didn't happen.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.673
Sent a message instead.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.470
- There's no one here.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.762
Are we sure we have
the right coordinates?

02:24.770 --> 02:26.931
- Turin's intel said
a contact named Molly

02:26.939 --> 02:28.895
would be here waiting for us.

02:28.899 --> 02:31.436
We give her the code number,

02:31.444 --> 02:34.936
she gives us the locater data
about the Hullen hives.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.483
- Hey, Dutch.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.532
- Oh, come on.

02:40.536 --> 02:42.697
That's Molly?
- We need Johnny for this shit.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.453
- We can enter a code.

02:50.630 --> 02:51.710
- Maybe you gotta be faster.

02:55.635 --> 02:56.841
Shit tits.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.926
Maybe the zeroes are O's?

02:58.929 --> 03:01.966
- Error.
Repeated improper code entry.

03:03.434 --> 03:04.970
Lockout in ten,

03:04.977 --> 03:05.932
nine, eight, seven...

03:07.938 --> 03:10.020
- So you blew it up?

03:10.024 --> 03:11.514
- Little bit.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.935
If you want to get technical.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.650
- Plus side, no one else
is getting that data.

03:15.655 --> 03:17.896
- You need a new brain.

03:17.907 --> 03:19.488
- You need a new face.

03:19.492 --> 03:20.902
- Not what I meant.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.071
Look, if we can beat
the Hullen into submission,

03:23.079 --> 03:24.910
my money's on you two.

03:24.914 --> 03:26.996
But it's gonna take more than
soldiers to win this war.

03:26.999 --> 03:30.912
We need our own scientists,
code crackers, engineers.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.785
We need nerds.

03:33.923 --> 03:36.005
- Johnny's on an emo walkabout.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.873
Meanwhile,
we still don't know why

03:37.885 --> 03:39.876
the Hullen left
a secret squad of ships here,

03:39.887 --> 03:41.752
how to get inside them,

03:41.764 --> 03:43.800
or where to find Aneela.

03:43.808 --> 03:45.514
You two gonna solve all that

03:45.518 --> 03:46.928
with your shitty cologne
and sexual tension?

03:46.936 --> 03:48.472
- | smell great.

03:48.479 --> 03:49.935
- Make a Warrant.
Pick some nerds.

03:49.939 --> 03:52.021
Take 'em for a spin,
see if they're field ready.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.764
If you like 'em,

03:53.776 --> 03:56.813
we tell them what's really going
on in the RAC.

03:56.821 --> 03:59.608
- Come on, let's go
traumatize some lab rats.

04:00.908 --> 04:01.943
- Yeah, this time,

04:01.951 --> 04:03.532
try not to explode them.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.630
- She'll pull through.
- Yeah?

04:26.642 --> 04:28.303
Why isn't she waking up?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.141
- Fight probably
triggered sleep mode.

04:30.146 --> 04:32.603
- It's like a
hackmod kill switch.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.937
We all have one.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.016
— Why?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.858
- The whole point
of making hackmods

04:38.863 --> 04:41.696
is to sell forced labor
with superhuman skills, right?

04:41.699 --> 04:43.064
- So?

04:43.075 --> 04:44.861
- So, how marketable
do you think we'd be

04:44.869 --> 04:47.485
if we could use our tech
against our buyers?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.750
No wonder you hate us Basics.

04:51.751 --> 04:53.707
- Some of you are
worse than others.

04:53.711 --> 04:54.700
| get that.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.122
Didn't always.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.712
People in this bar,
we're all runaways.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.832
Most of us got taken by repo,

05:00.843 --> 05:02.629
had our tech stolen,

05:02.636 --> 05:04.092
and we're still the lucky ones.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.882
No one's here because
we think Rat City's

05:05.890 --> 05:08.051
some kind of utopia,
but it's ours.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.798
Which is why you and your girl

05:09.810 --> 05:12.017
need to leave,
soon as she's able.

05:12.021 --> 05:14.683
Don't track your dirt
in my door.

05:15.816 --> 05:16.896
- She's waking up.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.608
- Approaching Leith.

05:23.616 --> 05:26.824
- 36 hours ago, a secure
research facility went dark.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.863
Hopefully it's just
a downed commstack.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.077
We need you to fix it.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.160
- Piece of cake.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.577
Barely seems worth our time.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.915
Ow.

05:34.919 --> 05:36.910
- We'll be out of
comm range down there.

05:36.921 --> 05:39.162
These chips will be
your communicators

05:39.173 --> 05:41.380
and trackers once inside.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.795
Do not lose them.

05:43.803 --> 05:45.088
- What kind of guns do we get?

05:45.095 --> 05:46.084
- None.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.802
You get none guns.

05:47.807 --> 05:49.297
- We do the bang-bang;
You do the tech.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.137
Once you restore
external communications,

05:52.144 --> 05:53.759
we can all go home.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.679
- Oh, when do you decide

05:56.690 --> 05:58.817
which one of us
replaces Agent Jaqobis?

05:58.818 --> 06:00.934
- No one replaces John Jaqobis.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.810
- Thank you, Dutch.

06:02.822 --> 06:05.063
Arriving at research facility.

06:05.074 --> 06:07.156
- Look, do well down there,

06:07.159 --> 06:09.115
Turin will clear you
for special field work.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.656
Screw up?
Back to lab life.

06:11.664 --> 06:13.746
This is your shot
to get to the field

06:13.749 --> 06:15.740
like real Killjoys.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.742
Don't waste it.

06:17.753 --> 06:19.744
- Strap in for landing.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.956
- How do you feel?

06:23.968 --> 06:26.801
- Like I got mule-kicked
by a jumper.

06:26.804 --> 06:29.136
- Or whatever the hells
that guy was.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.925
- They're called Skinners.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.049
- Some new kind of
illegal skin morphing tech.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.800
Can make you look
like anyone you want,

06:34.812 --> 06:35.892
for a price.

06:35.896 --> 06:36.976
- Who's behind it?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.142
- Look,

06:40.150 --> 06:41.765
| get you're trying
to protect your people,

06:41.777 --> 06:43.108
but so am I.

06:46.866 --> 06:48.447
This green shit?

06:48.450 --> 06:49.951
It's all over the zone
where I come from.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.863
And if the people
who use it are here,

06:51.871 --> 06:54.829
they got worse plans for you
than any Basic ever could.

06:54.832 --> 06:56.197
- Havigan,

06:56.208 --> 06:57.994
please.

07:03.883 --> 07:08.172
- Ajumper l was repairing
did some courier work for them.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.840
Said if I wanted in,
that was the place.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.884
- "Livio Surgical Spa:

07:12.892 --> 07:16.259
Where reconstruction
meets rejuvenation."

07:16.270 --> 07:18.852
I guess "We make skin suits"
wasn't catchy enough.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.471
- Well, if they've got
black-market productions

07:20.482 --> 07:21.983
going on, they're not
just gonna let us

07:21.984 --> 07:23.690
waltz in there
to the good stuff.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.309
- Well, lucky for us,
I know how to dance.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.040
- Welcome to Livio.
How may we serve you?

07:40.044 --> 07:42.035
- Not sure yet.
Felling stale.

07:42.046 --> 07:46.085
Could use a little refresher,
a little... zoosh.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.002
- Well, it will be hard
to improve upon

07:48.010 --> 07:50.843
your current perfection,
but we do like a challenge.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.261
Hmm.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.183
I enjoy a firm grip.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.226
- Same.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.064
- Ugh, gross.

08:05.069 --> 08:07.811
Your scanner gloves
are pretty sweet, though.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.948
ID captured, and we're in.

08:09.949 --> 08:11.029
Buy me some time, pretty boy.

08:11.033 --> 08:11.988
- Will do.

08:16.872 --> 08:20.285
- RAC agents.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.203
Anybody home?

08:22.211 --> 08:23.917
- Thermal reads say
nothing bigger than a mouse

08:23.921 --> 08:24.956
on this floor.

08:24.964 --> 08:26.079
Think we should be okay.

08:26.090 --> 08:27.830
- Depends on the mouse.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.217
- There should be crew here.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.089
- Somebody fired the maid.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.553
- I thought you said
the last communication

08:34.556 --> 08:35.966
was only 36 hours ago?

08:35.975 --> 08:37.385
- I did.
- Why so dusty?

08:37.393 --> 08:39.054
- Focus, everyone.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.767
First objective:
Find us the power room,

08:40.771 --> 08:43.228
and reboot shit.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.984
- You had 48 hours
to complete this job.

08:48.988 --> 08:50.228
It's now been 56.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.906
- I had an issue, Niko.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.866
- | see that.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.862
An allergic reaction.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.000
Did anybody see you?

09:02.001 --> 09:04.913
- No.
- Hm.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.876
- Maybe.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.004
The doorman on my way out.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.425
Six years working for them,

09:17.433 --> 09:20.425
they never learned my name.

09:20.436 --> 09:22.973
| just...

09:22.980 --> 09:25.266
| just wanted to know
what it was like.

09:25.274 --> 09:28.232
To be her.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.896
To be wanted.

09:35.159 --> 09:38.151
- l have other people
to protect.

09:38.162 --> 09:40.027
You really should have
thought of that

09:40.039 --> 09:42.030
before taking a last joyride.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.119
You knew the rules.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.224
- Clean her up.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.309
My next client is waiting.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.201
- John.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.362
I'm in the research level,

10:19.369 --> 10:22.156
and shit is weird.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.656
Like, creepy uncle spaceman
weird.

10:33.425 --> 10:37.009
Oh.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.092
Oh, great.

10:38.097 --> 10:39.257
Slime shower.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.800
Ugh.

10:48.690 --> 10:49.679
Johnny?

10:49.691 --> 10:52.182
You copy?

10:56.240 --> 10:58.105
- I know what you're thinking.

10:58.117 --> 10:59.448
It's almost a crime
to take my money

10:59.451 --> 11:00.987
when I'm already
working with all of this.

11:00.994 --> 11:01.904
- Mm, definitely.

11:04.123 --> 11:05.329
- We could man-up that jawline.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.412
- Say again?

11:06.416 --> 11:08.281
- Smooth the asymmetry.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.249
Not much we can do
about the ear placement.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.245
- My ears are adorable

11:12.256 --> 11:14.042
and can hear you.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.297
I'm not gonna lie,

11:19.304 --> 11:21.636
I would make sweet,
sweet love to him

11:21.640 --> 11:23.050
and he would like it.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.095
I am a sexy wolfman.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.968
- We can start your treatment
in a week.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.971
- Mm-mm, no-no, l was
thinking something more radical.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.643
l was hoping that I could try
someone else's look on

11:31.650 --> 11:32.935
for a night or two,

11:32.943 --> 11:35.025
see how it fits.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.984
If you have any freaky
little science tricks

11:36.989 --> 11:38.399
that can make that happen,

11:38.407 --> 11:40.318
I'm into it.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.657
- We got a body.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.201
- What the hells happened here?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.994
- Why is there no dust in here?

11:50.002 --> 11:52.459
- That's your takeaway?
Really?

11:52.462 --> 11:55.329
Maybe focus on
Corpsey McGuts over here.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.205
- The blast radius would
fill the room with frag,

11:57.217 --> 12:00.004
but most of it's in him.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.173
He was right on top of this
when it blew.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.012
Either he was fixing it or...

12:04.016 --> 12:06.007
- Or he's the one
who blew it up.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.179
- Damn it.
Where the hells is Zeph?

12:08.187 --> 12:12.055
I'll find her.
Just get the power back.

12:15.027 --> 12:16.358
- Hey.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.022
- Hey, I have
a gross suggestion.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.315
We could...

12:19.323 --> 12:21.029
Fish parts out of
this guy's guts...

12:21.033 --> 12:22.489
- Don't do it, rookie.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.278
- Try to piece this system
back together again.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.780
- Just get the power back on.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.951
And a mop, maybe.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.118
- Yoki?

12:35.130 --> 12:37.212
- What is your stupid Basic
doing with Niko?

12:37.216 --> 12:39.127
- Uh, looking for Clara,
your missing friend,

12:39.134 --> 12:40.465
unlike you, you shitty bitch.

12:40.469 --> 12:41.800
- You're going to
ruin everything.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.179
I can't keep protecting you.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.511
- What?
Me?

12:44.514 --> 12:46.254
I never asked you to,
you psychobox.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.053
- Listen to me.
Niko scans and IDs every client.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.052
Once she figures out
who and what your boy is,

12:51.063 --> 12:54.305
he is toast, and
so am I if she links him to me.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.147
Please, forget him.
Just run.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.357
- No, I'm not leaving.

12:57.361 --> 12:58.726
You might be a worthless friend,

12:58.737 --> 13:00.238
but I'm not.

13:02.157 --> 13:04.022
- Red door, end of the hall,
is a shortcut.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.150
If you go straight there,
you can still make it out.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.406
- Routine system check.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.370
Pardon me a moment?
- Of course.

13:16.004 --> 13:16.993
Hey, is that you?

13:17.005 --> 13:18.381
- Get out now.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.417
- Shit.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.507
Contagion detected.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.510
Quarantine protocol
is now in effect.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.103
Power Room B contaminated.

13:35.107 --> 13:36.096
- Quick question.

13:36.108 --> 13:39.066
Are we in Power Room B?

13:39.069 --> 13:40.559
- Begin purging in Power Room B.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.356
- Door!
Move, now!

13:42.364 --> 13:43.820
Go!
- Five, four...

13:43.824 --> 13:44.813
- Move, move, move!

13:44.825 --> 13:47.282
- Three, two,

13:47.286 --> 13:48.241
one.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.285
- What did you do?
The exits are all sealed.

13:54.293 --> 13:56.124
- Guys!
I figured it out.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.538
It's not dust, it's ash,

13:57.546 --> 13:59.332
human ash...

14:01.133 --> 14:02.168
- Yeah.

14:04.261 --> 14:05.376
Got that.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.849
- Okay, that was gross.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.431
That was so gross.

14:11.435 --> 14:13.141
There were all of
these skinned bodies,

14:13.145 --> 14:14.601
just hanging there,

14:14.604 --> 14:16.435
like a big prosciutto party
without the melon.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.146
- Anything else?

14:18.150 --> 14:19.560
- They were spraying
the bodies with

14:19.568 --> 14:21.229
all of that green shit
that you're looking for.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.521
- Well, plasma,
it has healing properties.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.485
Maybe they're
keeping the bodies fresh?

14:24.489 --> 14:26.104
Or regrowing the skin?

14:26.116 --> 14:28.323
- No, no idea,
but I know who does.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.613
Clara's friend
works for the skinners.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.157
So I say we go punch her in
the face until answers come out.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.281
- Wait, Yoki was at the clinic?
- Yeah, she helped me escape.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.157
- Okay, we gotta
flip her somehow.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.158
We gotta figure out
what this has to do with Clara.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.250
- Oh.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.494
I almost forgot.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.370
I brought you
a parting gift for that.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.338
When I was trapped
in the beef locker,

14:44.343 --> 14:46.174
| just wanted out,

14:46.178 --> 14:48.009
so I sliced some evidence
and ran.

14:49.598 --> 14:52.305
- You brought me hands?

14:52.309 --> 14:54.140
You brought me hands.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.259
- Don't get too excited.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.476
Not a lot of skin left on some.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.595
But can they still be lD'd?

14:57.606 --> 14:58.937
- I'm already on it.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.191
You better get some sleep.

15:00.192 --> 15:01.227
This is gonna take a while.

15:02.486 --> 15:05.319
Let the dark science-ing
commence.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.529
- Nerd.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.272
- And what triggered
the quarantine?

15:09.284 --> 15:11.240
- Well, this is
a Comm-3 facility.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.450
Disease nerds.

15:12.454 --> 15:13.614
One of their designer pathogens

15:13.622 --> 15:15.453
must have got out of the lab,

15:15.457 --> 15:16.947
triggered the emergency
sterilization system.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.209
- So shut it down.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.575
- Don't have clearance.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.417
Can't request it
with the commstack offline.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.286
That's why the engineer
blew up the generator.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.504
Cutting off power
was the only way

15:24.508 --> 15:25.873
to stop the sterilization.

15:25.884 --> 15:26.919
- Okay, let me
get this straight.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.212
Power on, we could burn.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.632
Power off, we're all trapped.

15:30.639 --> 15:33.221
Well, both those options
can kiss my ass.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.181
- Obviously,
Turin knows we're here.

15:35.185 --> 15:38.268
I say we sit tight,
wait for an evac.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.262
- I can hear you
thinking that's stupid.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.558
- The pathogen must have
still been in the room

15:44.569 --> 15:46.355
when we first got in.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.228
We're already infected.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.229
All of us.

15:49.241 --> 15:50.572
- Infected with what?

15:50.575 --> 15:52.361
- I don't know yet.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.200
I mean, it shouldn't
even be possible this fast,

15:54.204 --> 15:56.240
but based on body temp
and white blood count,

15:56.248 --> 15:58.409
at current doubling rate,
we'll have around two hours

15:58.417 --> 16:00.533
before our own viral loads
are high enough

16:00.544 --> 16:03.206
for the system
to detect us as a threat.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.919
- And then the fire
can turn on us?

16:04.923 --> 16:06.333
- We'll be dead before Turin
even knows we're missing.

16:06.341 --> 16:07.672
- Yep.
- No.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.258
- No?
- I don't accept those terms.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.173
- Uh, science doesn't
really work like that.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.966
- Make it.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.680
Figure out an override
and get us home.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.424
- What about the mission?

16:17.436 --> 16:18.972
We were sent to
restart the commstack.

16:18.979 --> 16:22.187
- Missions adapt.
Here's a new one: Survive.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.646
- Okay.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.736
Input prints and genetic scan.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.572
Processed through
all available RAC databases.

16:32.576 --> 16:34.282
And...

16:34.286 --> 16:36.277
boomshakalaka.

16:36.288 --> 16:38.449
Let's see what these
poor bastards have in common.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.322
— All three
have criminal records

16:40.333 --> 16:42.619
for human trafficking,
hackmod trading...

16:42.627 --> 16:45.039
- Stop.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.037
Repeat the second one.
- Hackmod trading.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.710
Outstanding warrants for
John Moosh, Torink,

16:49.718 --> 16:52.380
and Abel Connaver,
leader of the Connaver gang.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.968
- Yeah.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.337
I know who she was.

16:59.728 --> 17:02.390
They're killing hackmod owners.

17:05.317 --> 17:07.308
- How do you know?

17:07.319 --> 17:10.436
- Because I recognize one,
Able Connaver.

17:10.447 --> 17:12.483
She owned you and Yoki
for six years.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.741
Are you high?

17:16.745 --> 17:18.360
Because I've never had an owner.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.498
lescaped
straight from The Factory.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.615
- What do you
remember about that?

17:26.046 --> 17:29.288
Waking up
with parts of me missing

17:29.299 --> 17:31.255
in a surgical room.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.465
And then I don't know.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.630
I blacked out, I guess.

17:36.515 --> 17:39.507
There were flashes
of a transport ship.

17:39.518 --> 17:43.010
Me waking up with Alice.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.512
And then finding you.

17:45.524 --> 17:47.640
- What year is it?

17:47.651 --> 17:49.767
- No.
Don't do that.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.394
- What year?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.361
- 10-5-6.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.532
- You're missing six years.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.288
- Look, whatever game it is
that you're playing,

18:07.295 --> 18:10.128
it... I really don't
appreciate this shit...

18:10.131 --> 18:12.838
- Clara had a mod on her chest
that can't be removed.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.707
- It was one of a kind,
built from parts of a ship

18:14.719 --> 18:16.835
that crashed on
a moon called Arkyn.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.552
- I've never even
heard of that moon.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.297
- Exactly, so
you definitely shouldn't

18:20.308 --> 18:23.721
have that mod
in your chest, right?

18:23.728 --> 18:25.264
Unless you're her.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.770
We can settle this right now.

18:44.666 --> 18:45.872
Clara, I'm so sorry...

18:45.875 --> 18:48.332
- Do not call me that.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.588
- You have her arm.
You have no memory.

18:50.589 --> 18:53.376
Her best friend
is protecting you.

18:55.135 --> 18:58.627
- They skinned me?

18:58.638 --> 19:00.424
Somebody skinned me?

19:00.432 --> 19:01.797
Whose face is this?
Get it off.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.719
- Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Hey, hey.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.844
Listen to me, listen, we don't
know if that will hurt you.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.561
- I don't care.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.896
- I do, okay?

19:09.899 --> 19:12.390
I promise that we will
find out who did this,

19:12.402 --> 19:14.438
and we will fix it.

19:14.446 --> 19:15.561
So just...

19:15.572 --> 19:17.437
Just stay with me, okay?

19:17.449 --> 19:19.735
Now, you programmed Alice
to bring us together

19:19.743 --> 19:22.029
because you trusted me
to figure this out.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.451
So trust me now.

19:30.879 --> 19:33.712
It's okay.
It's okay.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.597
- Why can't I remember you?

19:44.601 --> 19:47.217
- I don't know.

19:47.228 --> 19:50.186
But you said that Yoki
helped you escape the clinic.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.603
So she wants to help you.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.100
And now I'm gonna make her.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.864
- There's an exit door
in the shipping bay.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.028
We should be able
to hack the locks.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.526
- Good.
- And bad.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.038
The only way to get there
is through here,

20:06.039 --> 20:07.495
Service Corridor Seven.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.706
- Currently being doused
in corrosive decon mist.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.951
It targets anything organic.
You know, like, uh, people.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.169
- Yeah, thanks for
dumbing that down.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.835
What's this at the end?
- The control panel.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.707
- If one person could
make it to the panel,

20:19.719 --> 20:21.380
they could shut down the mist
in that section manually.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.174
Everyone else
could safely follow.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.887
- How's someone supposed to
get there without melting?

20:24.891 --> 20:25.880
-Yeah...

20:28.895 --> 20:30.351
- You trust us?

20:30.355 --> 20:33.347
- No, I don't.

20:35.193 --> 20:36.854
- D'av?

20:36.861 --> 20:39.773
If this fails
and I die horribly,

20:39.781 --> 20:40.941
promise you'll eat all of them?

20:40.949 --> 20:42.814
- Way ahead of you, Dutch.

20:42.826 --> 20:45.408
I figured I can survive
on nerd till... winter.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.124
- Entering now.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.750
You're sure this suit
will protect me, yes?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.133
- It's what the math says.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.874
The math also says you only have

21:00.885 --> 21:02.466
a few minutes until
the suit corrodes.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.176
- Just get to the panel
as fast as you can, Dutch.

21:11.855 --> 21:13.391
- Hm.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.906
- Whoa.
Pulse ox falling, 94.

21:28.913 --> 21:32.405
Yep, I think there's
a micro-tear in her suit.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.123
Oxygen's leaching.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.913
- You said there'd be
a blue wire.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.956
- Shit. Um...
_ "Um"?

21:37.964 --> 21:40.080
- Any lower than 80
and she'll start passing out.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.206
- If you can't do this,
tell me now

21:41.217 --> 21:42.468
and I will pull her out.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.504
We'll find another way.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.500
- There's no other way.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.592
- Guys?

21:45.597 --> 21:47.053
- No, no, we can do this.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.921
Okay, you need to
find the processor,

21:48.933 --> 21:50.434
remove it, and then
reverse-wire the flow

21:50.435 --> 21:51.971
to the ODBC source admin.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.093
- What?

21:53.104 --> 21:54.844
- In English, jackass.

21:54.856 --> 21:55.971
-And you can't
reroute it that way,

21:55.982 --> 21:57.438
it'll just loop the signal.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.023
- Well, if you have
a better methodology...

21:59.027 --> 22:00.608
- A chimp would have
a better methodology.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.567
- Talk her home.
Now.

22:04.574 --> 22:06.610
- Dutch, do you see a...

22:06.618 --> 22:08.154
A small chip in there somewhere?

22:08.161 --> 22:10.117
Look for
something shiny, square,

22:10.121 --> 22:11.986
the size of your thumbnail.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.113
- Yes.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.500
- Okay, pop it out.

22:14.501 --> 22:15.991
Now, your gloves aren't lined,

22:16.002 --> 22:16.991
so you're gonna feel
a bit of a shock.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.539
Do not let go, okay?

22:18.546 --> 22:19.956
I know you can do this.

22:21.174 --> 22:22.459
- We're gonna need a conductor.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.547
Dutch, do you have a hairpin?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.876
- Yes.
- What's it made of?

22:26.888 --> 22:27.968
- Gold.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.178
- Good.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.638
Okay, now, I need
you to trust us.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.507
When you're ready,

22:32.519 --> 22:33.599
take a big breath,

22:33.603 --> 22:35.139
and pull off your helmet.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.886
- What?
- Pull off your helmet.

22:36.898 --> 22:38.559
Grab the pin, and
stab it in the hole.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.272
It'll short the whole system.
Got that?

22:40.276 --> 22:42.016
Pull, grab, stab.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.110
- 79. She's nearly hypoxic.
We're gonna lose her.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.444
- You don't know her.
She'll do it.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.532
Pull, grab stab.

22:49.536 --> 22:50.901
Okay, okay.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.879
- Gas cleanse stopped.

23:07.887 --> 23:08.876
- Yes.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.298
- Yes.

23:10.306 --> 23:11.842
- Vacuum purge commencing.

23:16.521 --> 23:19.103
- Dutch, give us a sign.

23:22.944 --> 23:24.900
- You're not sweating.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.145
- Thanks.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.612
Dutch, we're coming at you.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.947
- You weren't
supposed to come back.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.199
- Sorry to screw up
your evil plan.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.586
I'm rude like that.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.953
Tell her.

23:44.173 --> 23:48.257
Tell her.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.092
- When you first came here,

23:50.096 --> 23:52.007
as Clara,

23:52.015 --> 23:54.722
I told you everything
and you freaked out.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.717
You started causing trouble.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.343
And so Niko told me
that I had to

23:58.354 --> 24:01.596
make you disappear.

24:01.608 --> 24:05.396
- So you did, just not
the way that she meant.

24:05.403 --> 24:07.143
- Why don't I remember?

24:07.155 --> 24:08.645
- Jammer.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.112
Blocking all your memories

24:10.116 --> 24:12.607
since the day we met
at The Factory.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.031
You know what life
is like for hackmods.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.575
We're either running
or we're owned,

24:17.582 --> 24:20.119
but we are never equal;
We are never them.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.627
- So, wha... what is this?

24:21.628 --> 24:23.584
Some sort of
poetic identity theft?

24:23.588 --> 24:25.704
You literally take the skin
off your owners' backs,

24:25.715 --> 24:27.580
you impersonate them,
and you steal their money?

24:27.592 --> 24:30.004
- This isn't about money.

24:30.011 --> 24:33.128
Hackmods are starting a colony
at the end of the J.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.970
This buys us cryotransit,

24:34.974 --> 24:37.010
and enough to start a good life.

24:37.018 --> 24:39.430
Niko takes the rest
to keep funding the fight.

24:39.437 --> 24:41.143
- Oh, I'm sure.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.262
- I don't care
what you think, Basic.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.730
I'm done.
I got my papers.

24:44.734 --> 24:46.144
I'm free.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.733
l was gonna send for you

24:47.737 --> 24:50.149
once I found a place for us,
but we can go now.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.772
- I'm not going
anywhere with you.

24:52.784 --> 24:57.118
Just take back
what you did to me.

24:57.121 --> 25:00.613
- I don't know how.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.241
- Oh, don't fake cry for me.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.038
- What's happening?

25:05.046 --> 25:06.707
- She's not crying.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.388
Clara?

25:17.392 --> 25:19.599
Clara?
Clara, wake up.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.400
Shit.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.687
- J‘ I'm the pro, so tight

25:28.695 --> 25:29.730
I I'm the pro, I'm the pro,
I'm the pro, I'm the pro J‘

25:29.737 --> 25:31.773
- Oops.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.191
Nice try.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.694
Bring the Killjoy.

25:39.706 --> 25:42.698
He needs a touch-up.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.825
- J‘ I'm the pro, so tight

25:44.836 --> 25:47.168
I I'm the pro, I'm the pro,
I'm the pro, I'm the pro J‘

25:47.171 --> 25:49.662
I I'm the pro, I'm the pro
so tight J‘

25:49.674 --> 25:52.416
I I'm the pro, I'm the pro,
I'm the pro, I'm the pro J‘

26:05.940 --> 26:07.146
What is that?
What are you doing?

26:07.150 --> 26:08.310
- Shh.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.308
You won't want me to slip.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.856
- Newsflash, lady:
I don't want any of this.

26:12.864 --> 26:14.274
I'm not a hackmod owner,

26:14.282 --> 26:15.362
and I'm broke as shit,

26:15.366 --> 26:17.857
so what do you want from me?

26:17.869 --> 26:20.781
- Simple.
We could use a Killjoy skin.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.403
- That is...

26:22.415 --> 26:25.873
so deeply gross
to hear in words.

26:25.877 --> 26:27.117
Look, I'm sorry

26:27.128 --> 26:28.834
that someone took your damn leg,

26:28.838 --> 26:30.829
but you don't get
to take a life in return.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.206
- Oh, I disagree.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.048
You think this little toy

26:35.053 --> 26:37.339
makes you understand us, Basic?

26:37.346 --> 26:39.837
My owner was
the founder of this place.

26:39.849 --> 26:41.214
I was a scientist.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.136
I ran into some
financial difficulties

26:43.144 --> 26:45.806
with the wrong people
back on my planet.

26:45.813 --> 26:48.270
Buying my debt meant buying me.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.185
- Why hack a scientist?

26:50.193 --> 26:53.185
- Control.

26:53.196 --> 26:55.278
He took my leg
so that I couldn't run

26:55.281 --> 26:57.897
and replaced my eye
with a camera.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.404
So he could record
all my research.

27:01.412 --> 27:04.028
Quite clever, actually.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.406
He was the first one I skinned.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.203
- I'm just gonna put the word

27:08.211 --> 27:09.917
"therapy" out there for you,

27:09.921 --> 27:11.081
just as a general tip.

27:12.423 --> 27:13.879
Looks like you've given yourself

27:13.883 --> 27:15.248
an upgrade on the leg.

27:15.259 --> 27:17.420
- Oh, I've earned it.

27:17.428 --> 27:19.214
Are you feeling comfy?

27:19.222 --> 27:20.382
- Not even a little bit.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.469
-Gmm.

27:21.474 --> 27:23.055
Then let's begin.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.970
This might pinch a bit.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.355
- Whoa, whoa.

27:38.366 --> 27:39.401
Take it easy.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.319
It's just rebooting.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.410
- Where's John?

27:45.414 --> 27:48.121
- I think she took him.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.287
I didn't know that
they were gonna follow me,

27:50.294 --> 27:52.410
I swear.

27:52.421 --> 27:55.037
- We need to
take that bitch down.

27:55.049 --> 27:58.257
You know what the skinning
is about, right?

27:58.261 --> 28:00.923
Or do you just not care?
- I care.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.886
But I'm not standing in the way
of hackmods getting free.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.175
She's not killing
innocent people.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.389
- What about my friend?

28:05.393 --> 28:07.099
- If you want someone to blame,

28:07.103 --> 28:08.138
blame The Factory
for starting all this.

28:08.146 --> 28:09.511
— Why?

28:09.522 --> 28:11.979
They made us mods, not monsters.

28:11.983 --> 28:13.939
That part's on you.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.315
- So you've never
had any diseases?

28:19.323 --> 28:21.279
- Nope.
- Hormonal deficiencies?

28:21.284 --> 28:22.399
- Still no.

28:22.410 --> 28:23.445
- Do you have any strange rashes

28:23.452 --> 28:25.158
in your moist area...

28:25.163 --> 28:27.119
- Whoa-kay.
Offside.

28:27.123 --> 28:30.240
Look, I'm not super clear
on geek mating rituals,

28:30.251 --> 28:32.116
but whatever this is,

28:32.128 --> 28:33.493
I'm not into it.

28:33.504 --> 28:35.290
Super not.

28:35.298 --> 28:38.005
"Moist areas."

28:38.009 --> 28:39.249
Hey.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.091
When we get back, we are calling

28:41.095 --> 28:43.962
my slack-ass brother
and ordering his ass home.

28:43.973 --> 28:45.304
- Look, have you
ever thought that

28:45.308 --> 28:47.264
maybe John just
doesn't want to come home?

28:47.268 --> 28:49.008
- Well, then we're screwed.

28:49.020 --> 28:51.136
Because if this shitshow
taught me anything,

28:51.147 --> 28:54.014
there's only one Johnny.

29:01.324 --> 29:05.363
- That was phase one.

29:05.369 --> 29:08.202
Loosens the skin up a bit.

29:08.206 --> 29:10.071
Are you ready for phase two?

29:10.082 --> 29:12.573
- What does any of this
have to do with the Hullen?

29:12.585 --> 29:14.541
- Who?

29:14.545 --> 29:17.378
— The bastards that need
the green shit to thrive.

29:17.381 --> 29:21.340
- Oh, you mean my secret
little ingredient?

29:21.344 --> 29:23.175
- They will do worse
than skin you if

29:23.179 --> 29:25.044
they find out you're jacking
around with their plasma.

29:25.056 --> 29:27.342
- Mm.
- How did you find it?

29:27.350 --> 29:29.341
- It was here
when they brought me.

29:29.352 --> 29:33.561
Their R&D was investigating
its healing properties.

29:33.564 --> 29:36.021
I was hoping I would
grow back my leg.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.482
But no luck.

29:38.486 --> 29:42.274
When I spray this
on freshly skinned dermis,

29:42.281 --> 29:47.366
it keeps it alive and supple
between the hosts.

29:47.370 --> 29:50.237
I really couldn't
do it without it.

29:50.248 --> 29:52.284
I've sent jumpers
all around the J

29:52.291 --> 29:53.406
looking for this stuff,

29:53.417 --> 29:55.078
smuggling it back home.

29:55.086 --> 29:56.576
And do you know
what I've noticed?

29:56.587 --> 29:58.999
- That you have a narcissistic
personality disorder?

29:59.006 --> 30:01.213
- That whenever
there's green juice,

30:01.217 --> 30:04.084
there's always
Killjoys guarding it.

30:04.095 --> 30:05.631
Why is that?

30:05.638 --> 30:08.254
- Sorry, these lips
are technically still mine.

30:08.266 --> 30:09.551
And I don't feel like using them

30:09.558 --> 30:11.640
to kiss your ass before dying.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.635
- Once we have your skin,

30:13.646 --> 30:16.308
and I have one of
my people wearing it,

30:16.315 --> 30:18.431
I'll get all the answers

30:18.442 --> 30:20.433
and all the green that I need.

30:22.113 --> 30:23.649
Go!

30:23.656 --> 30:26.147
Don't move.

30:28.244 --> 30:29.450
I'm kidding.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.364
I know you can't move.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.041
- Preparing paralytic agent.

30:46.137 --> 30:48.128
- Wait.
I'm lost.

30:48.139 --> 30:50.471
Okay?

30:50.474 --> 30:52.385
Or is this where
you get your asses kicked?

30:55.688 --> 30:57.644
Hmm, guess so.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.647
- Contamination detected
in dock area.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.485
- Eenie, meanie, miney, nerd.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.150
Where the hells is Zeph now?

31:07.158 --> 31:08.614
Damn it. On it.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.232
- Wait...
Once the doors open,

31:10.244 --> 31:11.575
the locks will reset.

31:11.579 --> 31:12.659
We can't keep them
open that long.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.574
- We do not leave crew behind.

31:14.582 --> 31:17.244
- If I'm not back in time,
you need to leave.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.707
- Contamination detected
in Communications Room.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.500
Countdown to quarantine purge.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.088
- Okay, fake fire doesn't burn.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.469
Zeph!
Stand down!

31:34.477 --> 31:36.342
What the hells are you doing?

31:36.354 --> 31:38.345
- I'm doing myjob
and completing the real mission

31:38.356 --> 31:40.312
by restarting
the commstack, sir!

31:42.693 --> 31:45.355
- You're talking crazy.
You're gonna get us both killed!

31:45.363 --> 31:47.149
- That's not
what the science says!

31:47.156 --> 31:49.488
- Science says we're all
infected with something!

31:49.492 --> 31:51.403
It's messing with your head!

31:51.410 --> 31:52.695
- Maybe.
- Decontamination in...

31:54.163 --> 31:55.494
- Five, four...

31:55.498 --> 31:57.363
- You're right,
you're right, okay.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.161
— Three...
- Zeph.

31:59.168 --> 32:00.578
- Two,

32:00.586 --> 32:01.666
one.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.206
- Commstack online.

32:12.306 --> 32:14.422
- Yes.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.890
- Wakey wakey.

32:16.894 --> 32:18.930
Well, that was a waste
of expensive tech.

32:20.898 --> 32:24.265
- It wasn't real?

32:24.276 --> 32:25.812
So all of that was just

32:25.820 --> 32:27.356
a VR training simulation?

32:27.363 --> 32:29.854
- That chip on you?
Wireless sim-jack.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.981
Linked us all into the gameplay.
- Nice tech.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.448
- We're a little low
on agents right now.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.238
We can't risk losing
newbies in the field

32:35.246 --> 32:36.326
before they're proven ready.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.992
- So I won, right?

32:38.999 --> 32:41.911
- We put you through
three tests.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.284
You failed.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.877
- Wait, what?
No, I didn't.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.337
- The first was spatial.

32:47.341 --> 32:48.922
Could you figure out how to

32:48.926 --> 32:50.211
rebuild the generator
under pressure?

32:50.219 --> 32:51.925
- Next came communication.

32:51.929 --> 32:53.465
Could you talk a layman like
Dutch through the corridor...

32:53.472 --> 32:55.337
- Yeah, and third
was staying on task

32:55.349 --> 32:57.260
and completing the mission,
which is what I did.

32:57.268 --> 32:59.224
- Third was getting
everyone out alive.

32:59.228 --> 33:00.889
- Your refusal to adapt and obey

33:00.896 --> 33:02.352
put your whole team at risk.

33:02.356 --> 33:03.562
Go back to the lab, agent.

33:03.566 --> 33:05.477
You're done here.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.476
- But...
This isn't fair.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.819
I knew they wouldn't die
because I knew it was a sim!

33:10.823 --> 33:12.359
- Shit ain't fair.

33:12.366 --> 33:14.527
Lesson number four.
That one's free.

33:22.626 --> 33:24.491
Now,

33:24.503 --> 33:25.618
you other two,

33:25.629 --> 33:28.245
welcome to the revolution.

33:38.058 --> 33:40.595
- Sorry I'm late.

33:40.603 --> 33:42.639
I believe we have
an appointment?

33:42.646 --> 33:46.355
- You must be Ollie.
Or is it Clara?

33:46.358 --> 33:48.064
- It's "Bitch, you have
got to be joking"

33:48.068 --> 33:49.569
"if you think that
you're gonna take me

33:49.570 --> 33:50.980
with that little shit-stick."

33:50.988 --> 33:53.479
- Hm.
Let's find out.

33:55.117 --> 33:57.028
- J‘ I'm the pro, I'm the pro

33:58.496 --> 34:00.282
J” I'm the pro, so tight

34:00.289 --> 34:02.371
- Calibrating
paralytic injection.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.036
Motion detected.
Please stop moving.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.000
- I don't want to!
- Please stop moving.

34:07.004 --> 34:08.369
Recalibrating.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.292
Recalibrating.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.086
— Think, you handsome genius.
Think!

34:13.093 --> 34:14.629
- Recalibrating.

34:14.637 --> 34:16.468
- My mod.

34:16.472 --> 34:18.008
My sweet, sweet courtesy mod.

34:18.015 --> 34:19.516
Okay,
pIease-pIease-please-please.

34:19.517 --> 34:21.132
- Recalibrating.
- Come on, work for Papa.

34:21.977 --> 34:23.057
- Recalibrating.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.302
-Ah.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.308
Yes.

34:27.316 --> 34:29.147
Joke's on you, Niko,

34:29.151 --> 34:30.391
'cause Johnny

34:30.402 --> 34:32.438
ain't no basic bitch.

34:36.367 --> 34:37.447
- Clara.

34:43.082 --> 34:44.572
Do it.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.417
Do you know why you can't?

34:48.420 --> 34:50.411
- I didn't say that I can't.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.413
- Because we both
want the same thing.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.585
- Skin suits?

34:54.593 --> 34:55.582
Sorry.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.095
Not into it.

34:57.096 --> 34:59.382
-At least I'm not
ashamed of what I am.

34:59.390 --> 35:01.506
- I am not ashamed of my mods.

35:01.517 --> 35:04.429
- Not your mods, being modded.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.142
Knowing that someone
did this to you

35:06.146 --> 35:07.181
and you couldn't stop them.

35:07.189 --> 35:10.101
- Shut up.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.725
- I love my body.

35:12.736 --> 35:16.524
I would never go back
to just flesh and bones.

35:16.532 --> 35:19.740
But that doesn't mean
we should forgive them.

35:21.453 --> 35:25.366
If you really
want to help our kind,

35:25.374 --> 35:27.456
prove it.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.075
Let me go.

35:30.087 --> 35:31.952
- Hey.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.124
You okay?

35:33.132 --> 35:34.497
- Basic, stay out of it.

35:34.508 --> 35:35.714
This is not your call.

35:35.718 --> 35:37.629
- Oh, I know.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.092
That's why I called them.

35:48.981 --> 35:50.596
- Repo's on its way, Niko.

35:50.608 --> 35:52.223
You better move.

35:52.234 --> 35:54.646
- We're family.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.189
We're supposed to
protect each other.

35:56.196 --> 35:57.151
- We are.

35:59.241 --> 36:02.074
From you.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.621
- J‘ I feel alone

36:08.626 --> 36:10.708
- Thanks for seeing me.

36:10.711 --> 36:13.669
- How did you know it was a sim?

36:13.672 --> 36:16.163
- Whoever designed it's
obviously a gadget-head.

36:16.175 --> 36:18.632
They were so busy whacking off
to the tech details,

36:18.636 --> 36:20.718
they overlooked the bio cues.

36:20.721 --> 36:23.679
- Such as?

36:23.682 --> 36:26.515
- Okay, fine.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.097
First,

36:30.105 --> 36:31.561
all five of us were infected

36:31.565 --> 36:34.147
with the same viral load
at the same time.

36:34.151 --> 36:35.687
That's not how
pathogens work, man.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.150
They infect
at differential rates,

36:37.154 --> 36:38.655
based on body mass,
health, hydration...

36:38.656 --> 36:40.442
- Okay, I get it.

36:40.449 --> 36:44.533
So he goofed on
factoring our sweater sizes.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.788
- Also,

36:46.789 --> 36:48.825
D'avin didn't sweat.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.163
- Pardon?

36:50.167 --> 36:52.658
- He's obviously into you.

36:52.670 --> 36:54.661
And you could have
died in that hall,

36:54.672 --> 36:56.162
but his heart rate never rose.

36:56.173 --> 36:58.539
Which, once I excluded
adrenal malfunction,

36:58.550 --> 37:00.757
meant only one thing.

37:00.761 --> 37:02.672
He knew you weren't
in actual danger.

37:02.680 --> 37:07.515
And the whole thing was a test.

37:07.518 --> 37:11.511
- That was a massively stupid
risk to take.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.767
- Yep, kind of.

37:14.775 --> 37:17.517
But I was right,

37:19.071 --> 37:20.732
- Look, right now,
Turin's back there,

37:20.739 --> 37:23.230
telling the boy-geeks
that there's a war coming.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.198
Bigger than anything
seen in the Quad.

37:25.202 --> 37:26.282
- Holy shit.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.537
Who's starting it?

37:27.538 --> 37:29.199
-lam.

37:29.206 --> 37:31.868
The thing we're fighting,
it's organic.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.581
And we're never gonna beat it

37:33.585 --> 37:35.746
until we understand
its biology, so.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.541
Turin may not
want you on his team,

37:38.549 --> 37:40.790
but I need you.

37:42.678 --> 37:44.214
- Think you could
follow real-life orders?

37:44.221 --> 37:45.882
- I think I'd
follow you anywhere.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.550
Sorry.

37:47.558 --> 37:50.766
Too honest.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.681
- Welcome to Team Awesome Force.

37:53.689 --> 37:57.056
Weirdo.

37:58.736 --> 38:00.727
- Yoki helped me find it.

38:00.738 --> 38:03.650
I think Niko'd appreciate
donating it to the cause.

38:03.657 --> 38:06.114
Ooh.

38:06.118 --> 38:07.858
- Did you really
call repo on her?

38:07.870 --> 38:10.327
- Do you really want to know?

38:10.330 --> 38:12.241
- I'll take care of that.

38:12.249 --> 38:14.205
Drinks are on Ollie.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.620
- You know, Niko
might have been nuts,

38:19.631 --> 38:20.882
but she was a hell of a tracker.

38:20.883 --> 38:22.373
Sent couriers all over the J,

38:22.384 --> 38:23.840
charting green plasma sources.

38:23.844 --> 38:25.880
Fills in the rest of
the spots of my map.

38:25.888 --> 38:27.594
- Well, at least something good

38:27.598 --> 38:30.260
came out of this detour.

38:30.267 --> 38:34.180
- You asked me why
I hadn't gone home yet.

38:34.188 --> 38:35.268
And I think I've been waiting

38:35.272 --> 38:36.603
for you to have what I have.

38:36.607 --> 38:38.268
- What do you have

38:38.275 --> 38:40.766
that I don't have, John Jaqobis?

38:40.778 --> 38:42.814
- A reason to stop running.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.613
- I mean, the Quad's
kind of shitty,

38:46.617 --> 38:47.777
and eventually
some green-snot aliens

38:47.785 --> 38:48.774
are probably gonna take it over,

38:48.786 --> 38:50.947
but it's home.

38:50.954 --> 38:53.661
It needs me.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.872
And I want that for you.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.662
- Yeah, the fact that
we're all hackmods here

38:57.669 --> 38:59.375
doesn't make it home.

38:59.379 --> 39:01.335
- No. No, but the fact that
they came to save your ass,

39:01.340 --> 39:03.251
it's a hell of a start.

39:12.309 --> 39:14.766
Just tell me
you don't want to stay.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.767
Good luck with your war.

39:25.989 --> 39:30.608
And if you need
some hackmod backup...

39:30.619 --> 39:32.450
- We will.

39:32.454 --> 39:34.365
- Then call me.

39:40.003 --> 39:43.666
Pinky swear?

39:55.894 --> 39:58.010
- Whoa!
Whoa.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.181
- Johnny.

39:59.189 --> 40:01.020
I nearly shot you.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.730
- It wouldn't be the first time.

40:04.111 --> 40:05.897
- Look, I know
I've got a lot of...

40:05.904 --> 40:07.565
- Shut up, I don't care.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.985
- I'm sorry.

40:15.873 --> 40:18.706
And what about you, Luce?
Do you miss me?

40:18.709 --> 40:20.916
- If ships could cry,
I would have rusted, John.

40:22.754 --> 40:23.834
Now, she cares.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.129
Well, we've been busy,
hunting Hullen,

40:27.134 --> 40:28.715
trying to figure out who

40:28.719 --> 40:30.710
abandoned these
Black Root ships.

40:30.721 --> 40:31.881
- Oh, yeah, and Banyon,

40:31.889 --> 40:33.800
new head bitch in charge.

40:33.807 --> 40:36.093
We're gonna have to
get you past her.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.968
- Well, I've been
a busy boy too.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.810
Brought the rest of
the plasma map.

40:50.699 --> 40:53.190
- Johnny, it's everywhere.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.943
How the hells are
we gonna fight them?

40:55.954 --> 40:58.115
- One step at a time.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.205
Like always.

41:03.086 --> 41:06.203
- To Aneela.

41:06.214 --> 41:08.045
May the bitch
never see us coming.

41:29.279 --> 41:33.818
- J‘ All of us come

41:33.825 --> 41:36.783
J” From somewhere else

41:38.038 --> 41:41.280
J“ Nobody knows

41:41.291 --> 41:43.998
J“ Ifthere's a hell

41:46.505 --> 41:49.042
J‘ Power still lies
in the mystery J‘

41:49.049 --> 41:52.257
J‘ Of things that
we cannot see J‘

41:55.013 --> 41:58.801
J‘ That sunset or
thumbprint or soul J‘

41:58.809 --> 42:02.927
J“ You can't duplicate

42:07.985 --> 42:10.192
- Oh, good.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.231
You're awake.

42:18.829 --> 42:20.865
Welcome to my ship.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.746
Now come,

42:26.753 --> 42:30.871
tell me everything.

42:30.882 --> 42:37.879
- J‘ We all bleed

42:37.889 --> 42:42.758
J“ The same color

42:45.981 --> 42:50.224
J‘ We all bleed
the same color J‘

42:50.235 --> 42:55.275
I We all bleed,
we all bleed J‘

42:55.282 --> 42:58.820
J“ The same color

42:58.827 --> 43:02.945
J” We all bleed
