There's injured people out there.
I have patients.

11:56.560 --> 11:59.211
I shouldn't be here.

None of you should.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.731
What about you?

What about me?

After the things you've done,

12:10.080 --> 12:12.321
you belong here?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.883
Yes.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.326
What do you think I've done?

12:20.480 --> 12:23.211
You've killed people.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.885
We freed them,

12:25.040 --> 12:28.886
and then we were just
going to use what was left.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.366
You came here without knowing
what this was, right?

12:35.560 --> 12:38.166
That Morgan had me here?

12:38.360 --> 12:39.486
He said he wouldn't let you go

until he was sure
you wouldn't kill again.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.409
( Sighs )
It's just an infection.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.764

12:55.960 --> 12:58.201

on a rusty bumper.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.489
Just like that.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.769
It's not unfair or just.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.162
Nothing's unfair anymore.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.889
It might not kill me,
but it might.

No offense to Michonne,

We have food
to last us a while.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.444
They're bound to cluster up by then,
move off to one area.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.564
When they do, I'll try
and get to the armory...

16:04.720 --> 16:06.245
...draw them away.

16:06.440 --> 16:10.365
- With guns?
- Flares.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.410
I'll open the gate,
fire them off...

16:13.560 --> 16:17.281
see if I can get them
somewhere...

what was that?

I'm lucky, Michonne.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.686
Working with my family
towards a better future is--

16:59.840 --> 17:03.049
it's all I ever wanted.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.561
That's what I got.

right up to the end.

Yes, but what does
that mean for you?

in my mom's room.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.884
We can brace the couch
with them. What?

20:47.040 --> 20:49.646
- It sounded like you were fighting.
- Yeah, but we were fighting them.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.965
Carl?
It's okay?

20:55.120 --> 20:56.724
It's okay.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.601
( Walkers snarling )

21:00.760 --> 21:04.162
( panting )

21:04.360 --> 21:07.569
- Listen, I, uh--
- Hand me the gun, grip first.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.848
- Carl, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I know.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.168
Now give me the gun.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.044
Look, man...

21:25.200 --> 21:27.202
I get it.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.771
My dad killed your dad,

21:28.920 --> 21:31.651
but you need
to know something.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.246
Your dad
was an asshole.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.127
(walkers growling )

21:42.920 --> 21:45.082
( objects breaking )

21:45.280 --> 21:46.691
They knocked
the sculpture over.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.047
All that noise,
it's drawing more.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.561
(Judith crying )

21:51.720 --> 21:53.165
I'll get her.

I'm so-- I'm sorry.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.130
- I'm sorry.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.921
L-- I wanted to see her
one last time.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.287
I thought
I could make it.

22:42.440 --> 22:45.410
My legs
had other plans.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.130
Come here.

They're yours now.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.363
From now on...

23:13.520 --> 23:15.363
someone needs
to be with you.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.761
Y-yeah.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.923
It can't be her.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.730
Yep.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.523
I'll find someplace else to put her.

23:29.680 --> 23:30.886
Rick.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.890
I, uh--

23:37.040 --> 23:40.044
I wrote something...

23:40.200 --> 23:42.851
for Spencer,
for Maggie.

23:45.640 --> 23:48.450
I'll make sure
they get them.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.928
Will you
look out for him?

23:54.440 --> 23:57.250
- I will.
- Will you look out for him

23:57.400 --> 24:00.722
like you look out
for your people?

24:04.120 --> 24:06.566
Guess what.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.929
They're all
your people, Rick.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.764
They are.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.208
We haven't had a chance
to make it that.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.089
But that's how it is.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.928
I didn't run over to help you
out there because I like you...

24:23.920 --> 24:28.960
or because I think you're a good man,
a good father...

24:29.120 --> 24:31.441
or that you can grow
one hell of a beard.

24:33.280 --> 24:37.649
I ran over to help
because you are one of us.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.764
That's the right answer.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.808

You think this is it?

25:18.320 --> 25:20.163
Tara: What?

25:20.320 --> 25:23.722
Do you think
this place is over?

25:23.880 --> 25:25.882
No.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.491
I think we gotta earn it,
all of us.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.845
Whether it's waiting,
knowing if everyone's safe,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.685
dealing with that,
or fighting them.

25:40.240 --> 25:44.529
A place like this
has gotta have a price, right?

25:44.680 --> 25:46.762
We haven't
paid it already?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.084
Apparently not.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.922
( Snarling )

26:03.120 --> 26:05.566
It feels like
Abraham's dead.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.724
That's what it feels like.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.651
He's not dead.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.001
How do you know?

26:14.160 --> 26:15.969
'Cause I didn't see it.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.043
Doesn't matter
what it feels like.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.521
He's not dead,
and this place isn't over.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.644
Hey, we're here.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.411
So, what are we
gonna do, gorgeous?

26:38.480 --> 26:41.882
Gonna get in there, see what's happening
on the other side.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.281
We can shoot out
this lock.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.129
We shouldn't
waste the bullet.

Eugene:
You won't need to.

The couch!

I got this one,
you get the one behind it.

at least two.

away from him.

- He's tied up, he's not--
- I said get away from him.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.246
This could've waited.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.164
It should have.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.089
Now it can't.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.447
( Walkers snarling )

You stay here.

squeezing through, you get me.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.645
We're gonna need bed sheets,
enough for everyone.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.245
Bed sheets for what?

29:57.440 --> 29:59.727
We all go to the armory.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.770
- How?
- We're gonna gut these things.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.604
Cover ourselves
with the insides.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.923
It'll mask our smell,
make them think we're like them.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.205
I've done it before.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.125
We stay calm,
we don't draw attention,

30:14.280 --> 30:15.805
we can move
right through them.

they're making noise.

than them.

38:39.200 --> 38:42.921
Back.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.881
Tara: You're not gonna
make it out there.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.008
We'll see.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.964
( Walkers snarling )

39:54.760 --> 39:57.127
(growling )

40:28.480 --> 40:31.450
( walkers snarling )

40:56.480 --> 40:58.926
( no audio )

41:50.960 --> 41:53.486
(walkers growling )

41:59.440 --> 42:01.329
( ech0il1g )
Mom?

42:04.320 --> 42:06.084
Mom?

42:06.240 --> 42:07.730
( Walkers growling louder)

42:07.920 --> 42:09.490
Mom!

42:09.640 --> 42:12.484
( Walkers snarling )

42:12.640 --> 42:15.883
( theme music playing )

42:48.960 --> 42:50.689
(engine running)

43:02.040 --> 43:04.441
- Sasha: Daryl.
- Daryl: Yeah, I see.

43:04.640 --> 43:08.531
What in the holy shit?

43:08.680 --> 43:11.047
( Brakes squeal )

43:11.200 --> 43:12.406
( hisses )

43:17.160 --> 43:21.563
Why don't you come on out,
join us on the road?

43:21.720 --> 43:24.166
You know, if you wanna resist,
try something.

43:24.320 --> 43:26.891
I mean, it's a choice, I guess.

43:27.080 --> 43:31.449
But we will end your asses,
split you right in two,

43:31.600 --> 43:34.410
straight through to the sinuses.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.244
So, come on.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.244
( Engine turns off)

43:55.240 --> 43:56.366
Yeah, that's great.

43:56.520 --> 43:59.922
It's going well
right out of the gate.

44:00.080 --> 44:02.765
Now, step two--
hand over your weapons.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.161
Why should we?

44:05.320 --> 44:06.731
Well, they're not yours.

44:06.880 --> 44:09.724
What?

44:09.880 --> 44:12.087
See...

44:12.240 --> 44:15.562
your weapons, your truck,
the fuel in your truck,

44:15.720 --> 44:18.121
if you got mints
in your glove compartment,

44:18.280 --> 44:20.965
if you got porn underneath the seats,
change in the seats,

44:21.120 --> 44:24.169
hell, the seats themselves,
the floor mats, your maps,

44:24.320 --> 44:29.281
the little stash of emergency napkins
you got there in the console,

44:29.440 --> 44:32.011
none of those things
are yours anymore.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.049
Whose are they?

44:34.200 --> 44:37.488
Your property...

44:37.640 --> 44:39.961
now belongs to Negan.
