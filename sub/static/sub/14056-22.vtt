00:00.048 --> 00:01.055
Previously on The O.C.:

00:01.056 --> 00:03.291
Just promise me that you're going to quit this thing.

00:03.292 --> 00:05.724
It's about more than just the hospital. I can't just quit.

00:05.725 --> 00:06.747
I'm an alcoholic.

00:06.748 --> 00:10.586
Soon Marissa's going to wake up and realize she is so much better than you and your life.

00:10.587 --> 00:12.410
And you think she's going to come running back to you?

00:12.411 --> 00:14.940
Our kids got into college, it's a big day.

00:14.941 --> 00:15.910
Oh, my God.

00:15.911 --> 00:18.215
Oh, God, how did I not get in?

00:18.216 --> 00:20.780
I'm not exactly sure that Brown is the right choice for me.

00:20.782 --> 00:23.152
We applied to Brown so that we could be together.

00:23.151 --> 00:25.556
I need to get Summer back and I have to get into Brown.

00:25.553 --> 00:26.399
We need a plan?

00:26.399 --> 00:28.306
It's gonna be a long night, Ryan.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:43.933 --> 00:47.831
You taking all that? You only own, like, a wife beater and two hoodies.

00:47.832 --> 00:51.242
I'm sorry, okay, I don't know what people wear to prospective students weekend,

00:51.243 --> 00:52.383
so I just brought everything.

00:52.384 --> 00:55.707
I'm packing light. Want to be free and easy for pre-frosh weekend.

00:55.708 --> 00:57.419
Even though you're not a pre-freshman?

00:57.420 --> 00:59.101
It's called "pre-frosh," Ryan,

00:59.102 --> 01:01.821
and if I'm going to go there, I need you to get the lingo.

01:03.304 --> 01:06.947
Don't give me that sideways look. You were way into this plan when we came up with it.

01:06.958 --> 01:09.194
That's 'cause we only had the beginning.

01:09.195 --> 01:12.204
So, um... you're going to fly to Brown...

01:12.205 --> 01:14.432
And then I will somehow get them to admit me.

01:14.433 --> 01:17.932
Yeah, I don't have the, uh, the details yet, but...

01:17.933 --> 01:20.419
Brown's a spiritual place. I'll go, I'll get a vibe.

01:20.420 --> 01:23.140
Maybe I'll bump into the ghost of old man Brown

01:23.141 --> 01:25.069
or whoever they named the school after.

01:25.070 --> 01:26.503
Seth, you know Summer's going to be there.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.034
I don't know that for sure.

01:28.035 --> 01:30.483
Every student at Harbor is going to their college this weekend.

01:30.484 --> 01:31.338
I'm sure she's going to be there.

01:31.339 --> 01:32.947
So, it's not like we'll run into each other.

01:32.948 --> 01:36.536
We're going to a land of pasty Jewish kids. For once, I'll blend right in.

01:36.537 --> 01:37.846
Yeah? And your flight?

01:37.847 --> 01:39.796
Booked a ticket connecting through Chattanooga.

01:39.797 --> 01:41.953
Totally inconvenient, no way she'll be on it.

01:41.954 --> 01:44.475
Look, I just don't want to see you get deeper into this mess, okay?

01:44.476 --> 01:46.664
Dude, you're going to Berkeley with your ex-girlfriend.

01:46.665 --> 01:48.471
You ready to go? College calls.

01:48.472 --> 01:50.016
Uh, yeah. Think we're all set.

01:50.017 --> 01:53.635
Just think... the next time we send you two off like this, it'll be for real.

01:53.636 --> 01:54.889
I'll only be a few hours away.

01:54.890 --> 01:57.443
What about you, going all the way to the East Coast?

01:57.444 --> 02:00.148
If I wasn't so proud of you, I'd be angry at you for...

02:00.149 --> 02:02.096
All right, all right, we got planes to catch.

02:02.097 --> 02:03.258
Okay, let's go.

02:03.259 --> 02:04.399
Where's Sandy?

02:04.655 --> 02:06.212
Uh, he had an early meeting.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.293
He said to say good-bye.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.965
That's weird, the man lives for the airport sendoff.

02:09.966 --> 02:12.103
Well, I guess it was an important meeting.

02:15.984 --> 02:17.902
All right, well, my gate's this way.

02:18.483 --> 02:20.168
Call when you get there.

02:21.178 --> 02:23.186
Yeah. All right, bring it in.

02:23.187 --> 02:24.772
- We can save the hug for later.
- Yeah, okay.

02:24.773 --> 02:26.292
- See you Sunday.
- Okay.

02:28.228 --> 02:30.045
And what about you? Are you okay?

02:30.046 --> 02:32.187
Uh, I'm a little nervous actually.

02:32.859 --> 02:34.920
Ryan, Berkeley's going to be a breeze.

02:34.921 --> 02:38.425
I mean, you conquered Newport, and this town isn't exactly known for its hospitality.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.462
Yeah, but I had you and I had Seth and Sandy.

02:40.463 --> 02:43.293
Hey, you did this. You earned your future.

02:43.294 --> 02:45.870
- Enjoy it.
- All right, thanks.

02:46.571 --> 02:49.788
Have a wonderful time and call when you get there.

02:49.789 --> 02:51.174
Okay, I will.

02:58.376 --> 02:59.567
Hey.

03:00.496 --> 03:02.007
Hey, Theresa.

03:02.705 --> 03:04.219
Here you go.

03:05.484 --> 03:06.922
I'll take that.

03:54.238 --> 03:55.737
Can I borrow that sparkly scarf?

03:55.738 --> 03:56.790
Sure.

04:00.209 --> 04:03.360
What am I thinking? Kids at Brown don't wear sparkly scarves.

04:03.361 --> 04:07.127
Maybe on my way to the airport, I'll stop and get some kind of angry-looking piercing.

04:07.128 --> 04:09.633
Sum, you should just dress like yourself.

04:10.944 --> 04:13.354
This is all wrong.

04:13.355 --> 04:14.745
What, the scarf?

04:14.746 --> 04:17.136
No, this, all of this.

04:17.137 --> 04:20.161
Me going to Brown without Cohen. You going to Berkeley without Ryan.

04:20.161 --> 04:24.019
I'm going to Berkeley with Ryan, I'm just not going with him.

04:24.020 --> 04:25.650
Yeah, which is even weirder.

04:25.651 --> 04:27.372
Well, maybe it's a blessing in disguise.

04:27.373 --> 04:29.750
You know, this way we're forced to focus on the future.

04:29.751 --> 04:32.036
And we can start doing that this weekend.

04:32.203 --> 04:36.889
Hmm, big talk coming from the girl who chucked her acceptance letter in the garbage.

04:36.890 --> 04:40.151
Yeah, well, I was going through something.

04:40.152 --> 04:43.413
Is  "something" code for having an affair with an almost homeless surfer dude?

04:43.414 --> 04:46.422
And does your past tense imply it's over?

04:46.423 --> 04:48.052
Look, whatever I was doing with Volchok...

04:48.053 --> 04:49.229
I don't need details.

04:49.230 --> 04:51.123
I'm not doing it anymore.

04:51.671 --> 04:54.581
In fact, after today, I probably won't ever see him again.

04:54.582 --> 04:55.946
What do you mean after today?

04:55.947 --> 04:58.171
Well, he texted me to say I left some stuff at his place,

04:58.172 --> 05:00.585
and I told him I would stop by and pick it up before I left.

05:00.586 --> 05:02.669
Hmm, no, you won't.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.302
Saying your last good-bye with his dirty mattress in plain sight?

05:05.303 --> 05:07.535
That is breakup sex waiting to happen.

05:07.536 --> 05:09.211
Have you no faith in me at all?

05:09.212 --> 05:12.619
48 hours ago, Coop, you were Newport's Courtney Love.

05:12.620 --> 05:14.019
Baby steps.

05:14.493 --> 05:15.842
Fine.

05:15.864 --> 05:18.082
I'll just tell him to meet me at the diner.

05:18.972 --> 05:21.743
You know what? You should take this with you to Brown.

05:21.885 --> 05:25.669
They're going to love you, just so long as you be yourself.

05:26.813 --> 05:29.264
Talk about clichéd advice.

05:29.623 --> 05:32.520
I can say things like that, now that I'm smart.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.536
Here you go, my love.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.403
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:44.404 --> 05:46.036
You sure you don't want a ride to the airport now?

05:46.037 --> 05:47.017
Oh, no, we got it.

05:47.018 --> 05:49.861
But we could use your muscle to help get our bags in the trunk.

05:49.862 --> 05:52.282
Muscle. Guess I still got it.

05:53.050 --> 05:56.188
Marissa, honey, you know, it's not too late for me to go with you.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.563
I promise, I wouldn't embarrass you.

05:57.574 --> 06:00.702
I could pretend to be part of your entourage, or your Scientology guide.

06:00.703 --> 06:02.339
Mom, you don't have to worry, okay?

06:02.340 --> 06:04.800
Kids go crazy at college. You've seen Girls Gone Wild.

06:04.801 --> 06:06.414
Yeah, I lived it.

06:06.415 --> 06:07.950
Not the topless part.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.874
But  don't worry, I've got all that partying out of my system.

06:12.988 --> 06:15.195
I really do want something different from this.

06:15.196 --> 06:17.594
Well, the Cooper women do have nine lives.

06:17.595 --> 06:19.623
I'm just glad you're on to your next one.

06:19.624 --> 06:20.837
Summer's waiting.

06:20.838 --> 06:21.839
Bye, Marissa.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.075
Bye. I'll see you guys in a few days.

06:24.291 --> 06:26.183
- Bye, Mom.
- Have fun.

06:29.505 --> 06:32.609
Okay, did a priest just break in here and perform an exorcism?

06:32.610 --> 06:35.591
I don't know, but she's definitely out of the woods.

06:36.535 --> 06:39.865
Well, it's just you and me this weekend. What should we do?

06:39.866 --> 06:41.391
I could call the Montage.

06:41.629 --> 06:44.005
I can't, darling. I've got that dinner tomorrow night.

06:44.006 --> 06:45.735
Retirement party for the head of surgery.

06:45.736 --> 06:48.971
Oh, right, well, then, thank God for Netflix.

06:48.972 --> 06:51.009
Julie, are you ever going to come to one of these with me?

06:51.010 --> 06:53.520
Why? So the women can gossip about me after I leave?

06:53.521 --> 06:56.119
Now why would anyone want to gossip about you?

06:56.120 --> 06:57.234
Honey, I don't get it.

06:57.235 --> 06:59.225
You throw all of these parties for the dating service.

06:59.226 --> 07:01.524
Well, I have Kirsten then. She's my wing woman.

07:01.525 --> 07:03.382
So, invite Kirsten and Sandy.

07:03.382 --> 07:07.462
He can network with the doctors, and she can... wing woman.

07:10.561 --> 07:12.166
It'd mean a lot to me.

07:13.873 --> 07:15.159
Then I'm there.

07:19.632 --> 07:21.511
- Ryan Atwood.
- Oh, hey.

07:21.512 --> 07:22.915
- Sorry I'm late, man.
- No, no worries.

07:22.916 --> 07:24.232
Wes Siefert, your freshman buddy.

07:24.233 --> 07:25.244
Yeah, nice to meet you.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.681
- You need a hand?
- No, no, I'm good.

07:26.682 --> 07:28.266
Trust me, we've seen better days.

07:28.267 --> 07:29.925
- Come on, I'll show you the dorm.
- Okay.

07:29.926 --> 07:31.713
Hope you don't mind an inflatable mattress.

07:31.714 --> 07:32.948
No, sounds good.

07:32.949 --> 07:35.093
I saw on your profile you're from Newport.

07:35.579 --> 07:38.063
- Did you go to Harbor.
- Uh, yeah, you know it?

07:38.064 --> 07:40.276
Yeah, a few guys in my poly-sci club went there.

07:40.562 --> 07:42.077
You play water polo?

07:42.328 --> 07:46.437
Uh, no, no. You know what? Actually, I'm not really from Newport.

07:46.438 --> 07:51.284
I mean, I am, but up until the last two years, I was, uh, I was living in Chino.

07:53.420 --> 07:57.063
Uh, I guess I figured I needed to get that out of the way.

07:57.064 --> 07:58.776
I think you'll be okay.

07:58.777 --> 07:59.991
What do you mean?

07:59.992 --> 08:01.983
I got one roommate from Bangladesh,

08:01.984 --> 08:06.101
the other one's from Partridge, Kansas, population 300.

08:06.102 --> 08:08.311
So, there's no mold here.

08:08.312 --> 08:10.076
It's pretty easy to fit in.

08:10.176 --> 08:12.748
Ah, I guess I'm not really used to that.

08:19.656 --> 08:20.851
Hey.

08:21.993 --> 08:24.525
Summer's waiting and I've got a plane to catch.

08:24.526 --> 08:26.189
So do you have my stuff?

08:27.556 --> 08:28.735
No.

08:28.736 --> 08:30.392
What? Why?

08:30.393 --> 08:33.008
Tell me why you all of a sudden up and bailed.

08:35.167 --> 08:37.947
I really never thought of you as the possessive type.

08:37.948 --> 08:39.941
I just want to know what happened.

08:40.986 --> 08:43.101
It's what you already know.

08:43.102 --> 08:45.435
You and me, we have nothing in common.

08:45.436 --> 08:46.981
Right.

08:46.982 --> 08:48.784
You got money and I don't.

08:48.785 --> 08:50.007
Same old story.

08:50.008 --> 08:51.817
No, it's not like that.

08:54.610 --> 08:56.345
You  really want to know?

08:59.173 --> 09:03.243
When I was little, my sister and I used to always watch The Sound of Music.

09:03.244 --> 09:05.334
Yeah, sorry, I must have missed that one.

09:07.030 --> 09:10.836
Okay, well, there's this girl in it, Liesl,

09:11.339 --> 09:15.050
and I always used to think I was going to grow up to be just like her.

09:15.051 --> 09:18.895
You know, I'd have the really cute boyfriend, that looked like her boyfriend.

09:19.906 --> 09:23.024
And our lives would be just like the scene where they're...

09:23.025 --> 09:26.312
they're standing in the gazebo and singing to each other.

09:30.826 --> 09:32.611
Then I grew up, and...

09:34.615 --> 09:37.256
and I found myself doing coke and sleeping with a guy

09:37.257 --> 09:40.650
who I'd never had one real conversation with.

09:48.025 --> 09:49.807
I know it sounds cheesy,

09:49.808 --> 09:52.965
but I'm just not ready to give up on the Sound of Music thing.

09:54.904 --> 09:56.351
Not yet.

09:57.546 --> 09:59.416
Well, good luck with that.

09:59.629 --> 10:02.130
I'll be sure to drop off your stuff.

10:06.901 --> 10:09.170
No, it's not going to be a problem, I promise you.

10:09.171 --> 10:12.299
Look... Hey, hey, hey. Let me get back to you, all right?

10:12.454 --> 10:14.337
I was just about to get some lunch. You want to go out?

10:14.338 --> 10:16.149
Uh, I only have a minute.

10:16.150 --> 10:18.432
I am so sorry about the other night. I tried to call you.

10:18.433 --> 10:19.948
I came about something else.

10:19.949 --> 10:23.678
When I was at the airport this morning, I saw Ryan's ex-girlfriend Theresa.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.812
How's she doing?

10:25.813 --> 10:29.389
She had a baby with her, a boy, looked about two.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.100
- You think it might be Ryan's?
- I think it's possible.

10:32.101 --> 10:33.386
- You spoke to her?
- No.

10:33.387 --> 10:35.815
Well, then for all you know, he could be her cousin or her nephew.

10:35.816 --> 10:39.499
I saw the way she was with him, the way she picked him up-- she's a mother.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.415
Yeah, well, she told Ryan that she lost their baby, so...

10:42.416 --> 10:44.001
what are you saying, she lied?

10:44.002 --> 10:46.391
I just think we should tell him what I saw.

10:46.392 --> 10:48.763
We've  always been honest with him, that's why he trusts us.

10:48.764 --> 10:51.103
Oh, honey, let's keep it to ourselves.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.986
At least until he gets back.

11:13.025 --> 11:14.296
Hey, Seth.

11:14.297 --> 11:16.673
Hey, man, how's Berkeley?

11:16.826 --> 11:20.147
It's cold and wet and pretty cool.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.687
I can't believe I'm actually on a college campus.

11:22.688 --> 11:25.725
Ryan, I am touching ivy right now.

11:25.726 --> 11:26.531
What?

11:26.532 --> 11:29.343
Real ivy. It grows on the buildings here.

11:29.344 --> 11:32.505
Those pictures in the brochure-- they are not Photoshopped.

11:32.506 --> 11:35.186
Ah! I take it you're in the middle of the quad right now?

11:35.187 --> 11:36.571
Yeah. Dead center.

11:36.572 --> 11:39.083
Pretty stuff. I can't imagine anyone actually seeing you there.

11:39.084 --> 11:43.410
I know, I know. It's a Summer haunt, but I had to come visit campus for a few minutes.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.979
And it's perfect?

11:44.980 --> 11:46.836
Man, it's better than perfect.

11:47.638 --> 11:49.735
Seth Cohen has come home to roost.

11:49.736 --> 11:50.907
Cohen?

11:50.908 --> 11:51.812
Who's that?

11:51.813 --> 11:52.979
I don't know.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.872
I'm too afraid to turn around.

12:04.437 --> 12:05.731
Anna?

12:07.196 --> 12:11.232
So... Newport v. Pittsburgh. Who would win in a Smackdown?

12:11.243 --> 12:12.863
For me, Pittsburgh.

12:13.037 --> 12:15.195
Come on. You miss Newport.

12:15.196 --> 12:18.400
The sun and the surf. The surgery.

12:18.401 --> 12:22.391
They have not perfected the chin implant in Pittsburgh, but I am optimistic.

12:22.392 --> 12:24.042
Mocking Newport with Anna Stern.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.763
That is one of my favorite pastimes.

12:25.764 --> 12:27.064
Mine, too.

12:27.065 --> 12:30.111
But I did get a small taste when Atomic County came out.

12:30.112 --> 12:31.550
Hey, you saw my comic?

12:31.551 --> 12:33.399
- I was so proud of you.
- Thanks.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.247
But I do have a few notes on my character Punky Spitfire.

12:36.248 --> 12:36.810
Okay.

12:36.811 --> 12:39.568
And that mobisode was hilarious.

12:39.784 --> 12:41.369
What the hell is a mobisode?

12:41.370 --> 12:43.718
You don't know? I thought it was your comic.

12:47.020 --> 12:52.450
Oh. Yeah, it was, but I traded it to a guy named Zach Stevens in exchange for Summer.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.315
How romantic.

12:54.316 --> 12:55.384
How are you guys?

12:55.385 --> 12:58.305
Great. Uh... yeah, great.

12:58.306 --> 13:00.451
- Great.
- Great.

13:00.452 --> 13:02.048
Tell her I say hi.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.290
I  will.

13:03.447 --> 13:07.897
I wouldn't want her to get the wrong idea about us bumping into each other out here.

13:07.898 --> 13:09.932
I know, it does kind of seem like fate.

13:09.933 --> 13:12.127
Yeah. Not exactly.

13:12.128 --> 13:14.274
- Oh, ouch.
- No.

13:14.275 --> 13:20.603
What I mean is-- and, um, the only other person who knows this is Ryan, so...

13:21.699 --> 13:23.660
I am not officially admitted here.

13:23.661 --> 13:26.273
- You didn't get in?!
- Shut up.

13:26.274 --> 13:29.594
No, I didn't. That's why I'm out here this weekend; I'm trying to get in.

13:29.595 --> 13:31.738
And how do you plan on doing that?

13:31.739 --> 13:36.288
I haven't quite nailed that down yet, but now that I've run into you,

13:36.289 --> 13:39.770
who, if I remember correctly, is not only sage but wise.

13:39.771 --> 13:42.041
And you want me to come up with some hair-brained scheme

13:42.042 --> 13:43.665
to, what, smuggle you into college?

13:43.666 --> 13:46.425
Yes, please. For me? Listen, it's fate.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.774
You said it yourself.

13:52.663 --> 13:53.916
All right.

13:54.079 --> 13:58.265
There's a Meet the Faculty reception here tonight. I assume Dr. Overbee will be there.

13:58.266 --> 13:59.406
That's the admissions dude.

13:59.407 --> 14:00.630
You can try talking to him.

14:00.631 --> 14:01.823
And I will say what?

14:01.824 --> 14:04.431
You're the one who flew all the way out here, because you want to go here so badly.

14:04.432 --> 14:07.716
Don't you think that you should come up with that speech yourself?

14:10.139 --> 14:11.924
What are you doing tomorrow night?

14:12.073 --> 14:14.904
No plans? Good. You're going to Neil's dinner with all the doctors.

14:14.905 --> 14:17.000
Sandy can do some recruiting for the new hospital.

14:17.001 --> 14:18.630
You and I can sit in the corner and gossip.

14:18.631 --> 14:20.082
A fun time will be had by all.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.630
Actually, I'm busy.

14:23.105 --> 14:24.337
Kiki...

14:25.681 --> 14:28.139
All you ever do is sit in this house and drink tea.

14:28.140 --> 14:30.469
I mean, what's the real reason?

14:30.521 --> 14:33.236
Sandy and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.

14:33.237 --> 14:35.803
Oh. What happened?

14:36.043 --> 14:37.725
It's complicated.

14:37.772 --> 14:41.632
Suffice it to say, I'm not a huge fan of this hospital project.

14:41.970 --> 14:45.417
Well, are you a huge fan of me?

14:45.857 --> 14:50.126
'Cause, you know, I'm just saying, if you need a reason to go, you're looking at one.

14:50.127 --> 14:51.797
You don't need me to do this.

14:51.798 --> 14:54.138
Yeah, Kirsten, I do.

14:54.917 --> 14:58.348
You know, ever since Caleb died, the only way I've been able to navigate

14:58.349 --> 15:01.452
through these Newpsie-infested waters is with you by my side.

15:01.453 --> 15:03.261
Please, Kirsten.

15:03.262 --> 15:06.222
I want Dr. Roberts' doctor friends to like me.

15:06.636 --> 15:09.077
Fine. But I'm only doing this for you.

15:09.078 --> 15:10.351
Thank you.

15:10.908 --> 15:12.277
I owe you one.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.023
Or, you know, maybe it's more than one.

15:15.024 --> 15:16.445
But who's counting?

15:16.619 --> 15:18.113
Okay, see you tomorrow.

15:19.951 --> 15:22.565
- So your dad's in jail?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:22.566 --> 15:25.645
I've got a dad, one brother and two uncles locked up.

15:25.646 --> 15:26.846
You win.

15:26.847 --> 15:29.288
Miguel's the first in his family to go to college, too.

15:29.289 --> 15:30.430
Really?

15:30.601 --> 15:32.572
Let me ask you, ever feel out of place here?

15:32.573 --> 15:35.136
Oh, all the time. But, look, as long as I keep my grades up,

15:35.137 --> 15:37.575
I figure, I belong here as much as anyone else.

15:37.576 --> 15:40.357
One day, Wes here is gonna get my brother out of jail.

15:40.358 --> 15:41.975
Yeah, Supreme Court Justice.

15:41.976 --> 15:44.827
That's just a pipe dream. I'll be happy if I pass the bar.

15:44.828 --> 15:46.124
No, that's amazing.

15:46.425 --> 15:48.710
Oh, speaking of amazing.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.470
And she's headed this way.

15:56.471 --> 15:57.978
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:58.998 --> 16:00.807
You two know each other?

16:00.808 --> 16:02.478
We were in the same class.

16:02.479 --> 16:05.378
Yeah, at Harbor. Uh, this is Miguel.

16:05.379 --> 16:06.248
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:06.249 --> 16:08.256
And Wes, my freshman buddy.

16:08.257 --> 16:10.365
Yeah, speaking of buddies, where's yours?

16:10.366 --> 16:13.301
Oh, mine is a vegan, and she's boycotting this,

16:13.302 --> 16:15.130
'cause of the turkey on your plate.

16:15.131 --> 16:16.578
What can you do, right?

16:16.579 --> 16:18.330
So you're all alone, huh?

16:18.331 --> 16:20.471
Yeah, but I'm fine, no worries.

16:20.472 --> 16:22.001
See you guys around.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.942
Okay, there's definitely a story there.

16:26.943 --> 16:27.639
Oh,  yeah.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.808
And it's not "We went to Harbor together."

16:29.809 --> 16:32.356
Yeah, yeah, we dated, on and off for two and a half years.

16:32.357 --> 16:33.776
- That'll do it.
- Yeah.

16:33.777 --> 16:35.218
She seems nice.

16:35.219 --> 16:36.945
And lonely.

16:40.851 --> 16:42.749
Well, listen, if you want to go talk to her...

16:42.750 --> 16:46.472
Hey, hey, she's your ex, I'm your buddy. Not a good mix.

16:46.473 --> 16:50.276
No, honestly. I'm gonna be in college with her, so I've got to get used to it.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.118
Really, go for it.

16:52.119 --> 16:54.103
- Sure you don't mind?
- No.

16:59.654 --> 17:03.042
So... let me tell you about Rush week.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.746
Okay, look, there he is--

17:10.941 --> 17:13.935
Dr. Overbee, Head of Admissions.

17:15.561 --> 17:16.792
What? What?

17:16.794 --> 17:18.106
Nothing, I'm just looking around.

17:18.107 --> 17:19.502
Why are you acting like a fugitive?

17:19.503 --> 17:21.990
Uh, no, no, I'm just trying to stay under the radar.

17:21.991 --> 17:23.602
You never know who's gonna be at these things.

17:23.603 --> 17:24.887
Well, focus.

17:24.887 --> 17:26.599
Have you thought about what you're gonna say to him?

17:26.601 --> 17:29.367
Uh, probably just gonna riff.

17:29.472 --> 17:31.355
You know? Uh, we're both dudes.

17:31.356 --> 17:34.318
I mean, even though he's got a bow tie and probably like nine Ph.D.s,

17:34.319 --> 17:37.931
underneath, I'm sure we're pretty much the same.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.586
Could you maybe think of some talking points?

17:42.094 --> 17:44.451
Okay, shh. He's by himself. This is my moment.

17:47.383 --> 17:49.313
- Dr. Overbee.
- Hi.

17:49.314 --> 17:53.462
The fact is, the U.S. has been performing its own jihads for decades.

17:53.463 --> 17:56.412
Just instead of Allah, the killing is done in the name of oil.

17:56.413 --> 17:57.862
Totally.

17:58.380 --> 18:00.306
You guys, what is a jihad?

18:04.230 --> 18:05.758
Exactly.

18:05.987 --> 18:08.331
Way to reframe the question, Summer.

18:12.803 --> 18:15.467
- What was your name again?
- Seth Cohen.

18:15.468 --> 18:18.644
You may remember me from my application essay on Superman.

18:18.873 --> 18:20.546
Lonely guy, Superman.

18:20.547 --> 18:25.017
I don't recall it at the moment, but if you're here today, I trust it was exceptional.

18:25.018 --> 18:26.773
Yeah, about that. Do you have a minute?

18:26.774 --> 18:29.306
You maybe want to take a walk, stretch your legs?

18:29.307 --> 18:32.444
I'm sorry, this is a faculty reception, I have to be here.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.174
I should make the rounds. It was nice to meet you.

18:34.175 --> 18:36.066
Dr. Overbee, please. I really need to talk to you.

18:36.067 --> 18:38.303
If you can't do it now, name the time and place.

18:38.304 --> 18:40.180
All I need is five minutes.

18:40.622 --> 18:43.759
I suppose I could see you here tomorrow around 5:00?

18:43.760 --> 18:46.420
Great, thank you so much. Thank you so much.

18:46.659 --> 18:47.833
Cohen?

18:50.835 --> 18:53.779
Oh, hey. What's going on?

18:53.780 --> 18:55.795
What the hell are you doing here?

18:55.796 --> 18:59.736
Ah... Providence in spring, can't beat it.

18:59.737 --> 19:04.324
So you are going to Brown. You just didn't want to come with me.

19:04.780 --> 19:06.193
How'd it go?

19:06.194 --> 19:07.490
Anna.

19:07.607 --> 19:09.072
Summer.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.298
You're probably really confused right about now.

19:12.299 --> 19:14.480
No, not at all.

19:14.481 --> 19:18.834
All of this, everything you've done up until now, finally makes sense.

19:29.541 --> 19:31.843
So you and Ryan dated for how long?

19:31.844 --> 19:33.213
Couple years.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.839
But we've both been with other people since then.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.028
It's not exactly normal yet, but we're working on it.

19:39.029 --> 19:40.849
So where is Ryan anyway?

19:40.850 --> 19:42.656
Tour of the architecture building.

19:42.657 --> 19:45.207
I never set foot in there, so I couldn't really show him around.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.469
Where do you hang out?

19:46.470 --> 19:48.173
Poly-sci building.

19:48.174 --> 19:50.490
Sexy, right? It's my major.

19:50.491 --> 19:52.337
I'm just hoping it gets me into law school.

19:52.338 --> 19:54.542
My dad was a poly-sci major.

19:55.517 --> 19:58.433
No, you kind of remind me of him a little bit.

19:58.642 --> 20:00.694
The good parts, at least.

20:00.695 --> 20:02.881
Well, if that's a compliment, I'll take it.

20:02.882 --> 20:04.272
It is.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.301
One second.

20:10.302 --> 20:11.522
Hey, Ryan.

20:11.523 --> 20:13.209
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:13.263 --> 20:15.035
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

20:15.036 --> 20:17.095
Yeah, I hope it's not weird that I am.

20:17.096 --> 20:19.401
I don't really know what the rules are between us.

20:19.402 --> 20:20.841
Oh, me either.

20:22.333 --> 20:26.693
So I know the whole friendship thing didn't really work out in Newport, but...

20:26.694 --> 20:30.356
That was Newport, you know? Everything feels different here. I'm willing to try.

20:30.357 --> 20:32.432
Hmm. Well, I don't know.

20:32.433 --> 20:34.192
You know, 'cause if I was in your circle of friends,

20:34.193 --> 20:36.951
I might accidentally let it slip that you used to do musicals.

20:36.952 --> 20:40.264
I have enough dirt on you to last the next four years, so bring it on.

20:40.665 --> 20:41.819
That might be true.

20:41.820 --> 20:43.678
Anyway, you want to come sit with me and Wes?

20:43.679 --> 20:45.481
I want to hear about your architecture tour.

20:45.482 --> 20:46.993
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:46.994 --> 20:48.089
Yeah?

20:53.650 --> 20:56.315
Seth, it's okay.

20:56.316 --> 20:58.980
I'm sorry, I should have told you I was on a Summer mission.

20:58.981 --> 21:00.914
Yeah, well, I should have known it.

21:01.245 --> 21:04.626
But I can't be mad at you when you're this pathetic.

21:04.627 --> 21:05.811
Thank you.

21:05.812 --> 21:09.519
Now stop wallowing, and let's figure out how we're gonna get you out of this.

21:10.549 --> 21:11.765
Why do you want to help me?

21:11.766 --> 21:14.757
It's the pathetic thing. It really works on me.

21:15.147 --> 21:18.605
Okay, look, here's a list of tomorrow's pre-frosh activities.

21:18.606 --> 21:21.011
Try and figure out which ones Summer might go to.

21:21.012 --> 21:23.230
I don't know. She's never been much of a joiner.

21:23.243 --> 21:25.295
Maybe the walking tour; she likes cardio.

21:25.296 --> 21:27.586
Oh, good, you can go to that, you can talk to her.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.689
But now we've got to figure out what you're gonna say to Dr. Overbee.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.381
I don't know. If he didn't like my Superman essay, I'm out.

21:33.382 --> 21:36.143
Seth, you flew all this way to win her back.

21:36.144 --> 21:39.518
Now have you five minutes with Dr. Overbee to make it happen.

21:39.561 --> 21:41.597
We're gonna write the speech.

21:43.565 --> 21:46.233
What have I done the last two years without you?

21:46.577 --> 21:48.335
Honestly...

21:49.415 --> 21:50.908
I don't know.

21:55.241 --> 21:58.442
Hey. I got your message about the hospital dinner.

21:58.443 --> 21:59.751
Tomorrow night. Can you make it?

21:59.752 --> 22:03.518
Absolutely. Maybe I can get some of these doctors excited about the new hospital.

22:04.244 --> 22:05.381
Hey!

22:05.791 --> 22:09.205
Ryan! How are my old stomping grounds?

22:10.356 --> 22:12.270
I'm happy to hear that.

22:12.642 --> 22:15.688
Hey, listen, you know what? I got a call that I got to take here.

22:15.689 --> 22:18.538
It's work. I'm going to hand you off to Kirsten, all right?

22:18.539 --> 22:19.865
Have fun.

22:20.182 --> 22:21.488
Hello.

22:24.003 --> 22:25.685
Hey, how's it going?

22:25.686 --> 22:29.378
Hey, Kirsten, it's, um, it's actually kind of amazing.

22:29.379 --> 22:31.814
- How are you?
- Fine. I'm good, fine.

22:31.815 --> 22:33.340
You don't sound fine.

22:33.341 --> 22:36.128
Don't be silly. Tell me more about college.

22:36.766 --> 22:38.641
Kirsten, what's going on?

22:39.481 --> 22:41.307
It can wait till you get home.

22:41.308 --> 22:43.089
Okay, so there is something.

22:43.124 --> 22:46.293
It's really... it-it's not... it's not important.

22:46.294 --> 22:48.714
Then you won't mind telling me what is it.

22:52.562 --> 22:56.674
I-I don't want you to overreact because that's probably what I am doing.

22:57.519 --> 22:59.769
I saw Theresa at the airport.

23:00.688 --> 23:02.459
She had a baby with her.

23:02.460 --> 23:04.226
It looked like her son.

23:06.629 --> 23:07.750
An-And you think?

23:07.751 --> 23:09.617
I don't know what I think.

23:28.071 --> 23:29.219
There she is.

23:29.220 --> 23:33.039
Now, remember, you're just gonna tell her the truth.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.731
- Right.
- Yes.

23:35.434 --> 23:37.233
Okay, all of it.

23:44.061 --> 23:45.838
Summer, can I talk to you?

23:45.839 --> 23:47.382
Just leave me alone, Cohen.

23:47.383 --> 23:50.653
Hey, everyone. Hello. My name is Jack.

23:50.654 --> 23:54.012
I'm a sophomore here at Brown, and I'll be leading this walking tour.

23:54.013 --> 23:57.567
So long as everyone's got their name tags, we can get started.

23:57.568 --> 23:59.718
Look, I want to explain to you about everything.

23:59.719 --> 24:04.309
Uh, you in the, uh, striped shirt-- do you have a name tag?

24:04.421 --> 24:07.260
Uh... yeah. Yeah, I do. I'm all set.

24:09.291 --> 24:12.392
Kumar? Your-Your name is Kumar?

24:12.639 --> 24:15.579
Yes. Kumar Zimmerman.

24:15.580 --> 24:19.670
I'm half Indian, I am half Jewish. I am a Hin-Jew.

24:19.670 --> 24:21.437
Well, good, good then.

24:22.279 --> 24:24.829
Um, well, come, everyone, right this way.

24:26.739 --> 24:31.099
Now to our left, we've got the main dining hall...

24:31.300 --> 24:35.490
Ever since we got our acceptance letters, I've been acting like a freak, I know that.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.481
Does this tour offer an audio option?

24:38.482 --> 24:40.843
You know, like when you get headsets at the museum?

24:41.500 --> 24:42.714
No.

24:45.190 --> 24:48.403
- To the right, we have...
- Summer, you can't just ignore me forever.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.542
Oh, yes, I can. Don't you remember middle school?

24:50.543 --> 24:53.147
I was really good at ignoring you. Now, I'm just getting back into shape.

24:53.148 --> 24:56.181
Look, I promise you, I did not know Anna was going to be here.

24:56.182 --> 24:59.199
Hey, Kumar. Kumar, do you want to keep it down?

24:59.423 --> 25:01.067
Yeah, sorry.

25:01.068 --> 25:03.003
You're probably wondering about the Kumar thing.

25:03.004 --> 25:07.816
Uh, again, if you let me explain, I promise you it will all make sense.

25:07.817 --> 25:11.268
Oh, no. It already makes sense, okay? I don't need any explanation.

25:11.565 --> 25:14.601
You broke up with me 'cause you wanted to be free to date smart women in college.

25:14.602 --> 25:15.872
You got quite the head start.

25:15.873 --> 25:18.149
Summer, that is so not it.

25:18.150 --> 25:22.056
Look, you already ruined senior year for me. There's nothing I can do about that now.

25:22.057 --> 25:24.233
I'm not going to let you ruin college, too.

25:24.234 --> 25:27.599
Now will you please just leave me alone? Please!

25:31.557 --> 25:32.642
- Hi.
- Ryan.

25:32.643 --> 25:33.911
I couldn't stay.

25:33.912 --> 25:35.708
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told you.

25:35.709 --> 25:37.641
No, no. I'm glad you did.

25:39.523 --> 25:42.092
It's funny. In a way, I was kind of expecting it.

25:42.437 --> 25:46.594
I mean, for once things were uncomplicated. How long could that last, right?

25:47.009 --> 25:48.258
Well, maybe it's not.

25:48.259 --> 25:49.946
Yeah, yeah, I know.

25:50.138 --> 25:53.490
Whatever is going on with Theresa, we'll get to the bottom of it.

25:54.473 --> 25:57.923
I did some research on the Internet, and I found her address.

25:57.924 --> 26:01.200
Oh, great, thanks. I'm going to put this in the pool house.

26:01.201 --> 26:05.522
Ryan, no matter what happens, we're behind you.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.224
Dr. Overbee, you made it.

26:13.225 --> 26:16.398
Yes. Well, as I said, I've only got five minutes.

26:16.399 --> 26:18.744
Sure, sure, okay. You're a busy guy,

26:18.745 --> 26:20.623
and I have a tendency to ramble,

26:20.624 --> 26:23.075
which is why I've prepared this statement.

26:24.050 --> 26:29.018
Dr. Overbee, the following is a list of reasons why I should have gotten into Brown.

26:29.019 --> 26:32.365
Wait a minute. You didn't get in?

26:32.627 --> 26:36.649
No, I didn't, but only because I'm sure there was some sort of clerical error,

26:36.650 --> 26:38.981
or maybe a human error. Maybe the computer froze.

26:38.982 --> 26:42.089
Mr. Cohen, I was under the impression you were an admitted student.

26:42.090 --> 26:43.246
That's why I came to meet you.

26:43.247 --> 26:45.056
I know. But will you please just listen to me,

26:45.057 --> 26:48.075
and if you still don't want to let me in, at least I'll know I tried?

26:48.587 --> 26:49.790
Okay.

26:50.357 --> 26:52.037
You have one minute.

26:52.038 --> 26:54.445
Then I'm going to have to sort of, uh, condense this,

26:54.446 --> 26:56.924
maybe make it more of a bullet point thing.

26:58.523 --> 27:00.795
Grades-- 3.8. Hmm?

27:00.796 --> 27:05.501
Uh, SATs-- 2250. That's not perfect, but I would say it's respectable.

27:05.502 --> 27:07.340
I was President of the Comic Book Club.

27:07.341 --> 27:10.573
I was also a member of the chess team, although I was extremely low-profile about it.

27:10.574 --> 27:11.914
- 30 seconds.
- Okay.

27:11.915 --> 27:16.088
Now, here's the part about how I belong on the East Coast, and...

27:16.462 --> 27:19.756
This is a little joke about the weather here, just to keep it light. It's pretty funny.

27:19.757 --> 27:21.416
And, uh...

27:23.221 --> 27:25.110
I guess that's about it.

27:26.010 --> 27:28.007
That was compelling.

27:28.407 --> 27:32.461
But you misled me, and you wasted my time.

27:32.462 --> 27:35.502
So now I trust you'll show yourself off campus.

27:37.403 --> 27:40.258
Dr. Overbee, I have to get in here.

27:40.259 --> 27:44.442
Okay? And it's not just because I love it, although I do, I truly... I do.

27:45.215 --> 27:48.898
It's because of a girl. Her name is Summer Roberts, and she's going here,

27:48.899 --> 27:53.519
and if I don't get in, I'm going to lose her, and the rest of my life is going to be ruined.

27:55.576 --> 27:58.161
- So this is about a girl?
- Yes.

27:58.162 --> 27:59.879
It's about the girl.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.768
- Do you get it?
- I do.

28:05.180 --> 28:08.245
But we make commitments when we send out those letters,

28:08.246 --> 28:11.485
and for better or for worse, we stick to them.

28:12.693 --> 28:13.450
Please?

28:13.451 --> 28:16.497
I wish I could help you, but you're going to have to do this yourself.

28:16.498 --> 28:17.742
Good luck.

28:23.293 --> 28:26.429
Ryan, I thought you weren't getting home until tomorrow.

28:26.430 --> 28:28.039
Uh, Kirsten didn't tell you?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.429
No, no, she didn't.

28:29.430 --> 28:31.770
Yeah, I kind of figured I needed to get home and deal with this.

28:31.771 --> 28:33.071
Right, right, of course.

28:33.072 --> 28:34.681
You know, in case it turns out to be...

28:34.682 --> 28:36.748
We'll cross that bridge if and when we come to it.

28:36.749 --> 28:38.972
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

28:38.973 --> 28:40.168
All right.

28:52.472 --> 28:53.527
You told him.

28:53.528 --> 28:55.021
I didn't think he'd come home.

28:55.022 --> 28:56.939
Well, you know Ryan better than that.

28:56.940 --> 29:00.709
It just happened, you weren't there, you had to take a business call.

29:00.710 --> 29:03.085
Oh, so you told Ryan about Theresa to punish me?

29:03.086 --> 29:05.527
I told him because he asked, because he has a right to know.

29:05.528 --> 29:08.291
Theresa hasn't demanded anything of him, why should we?

29:08.292 --> 29:11.920
Being a father is important. Being a family is important.

29:11.921 --> 29:14.411
There was a time when you'd be making this argument.

29:14.412 --> 29:15.760
What's that supposed to mean?

29:15.761 --> 29:17.276
You know what I'm talking about.

29:17.277 --> 29:20.440
I know that we have to talk about this some more, and I can't right now.

29:20.441 --> 29:22.496
I got to go back to the office before dinner.

29:22.497 --> 29:24.400
It'll have to wait, fine.

29:35.436 --> 29:36.718
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

29:36.719 --> 29:39.193
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

29:39.898 --> 29:41.509
Oh, thanks.

29:42.089 --> 29:44.499
- Staying dry?
- Yeah.

29:45.869 --> 29:47.673
- Here.
- Thanks.

29:47.674 --> 29:50.166
So, we are having some people back to our place later.

29:50.167 --> 29:51.593
You want to come by?

29:51.634 --> 29:54.549
Oh, well, I was supposed to go to a freshman barbecue,

29:54.550 --> 29:58.305
but considering the rain, I could be persuaded otherwise.

29:58.306 --> 30:00.467
Good. You'll come over then.

30:00.845 --> 30:03.504
- Hey, where's Ryan?
- Uh, left this morning.

30:04.439 --> 30:05.584
He went home?

30:05.585 --> 30:07.532
Yeah, some family emergency.

30:07.622 --> 30:11.100
Uh, it didn't seem like he wanted to talk about it, so, I didn't push it.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.668
Well, I should call him.

30:14.644 --> 30:16.406
Or shouldn't I?

30:16.710 --> 30:19.027
I don't know. Should I give him space?

30:19.028 --> 30:21.699
It's not easy being friends with your ex, is it?

30:22.681 --> 30:25.953
Look, you know Ryan better than I do, but...

30:25.954 --> 30:29.067
seems like whatever was happening, it was private.

30:29.266 --> 30:30.997
He'll tell you if he wants.

30:30.998 --> 30:32.643
I guess so.

30:33.305 --> 30:35.028
Well, this thing is getting heavy.

30:35.029 --> 30:36.245
Is that a hint?

30:36.646 --> 30:38.109
Yeah, thanks.

30:38.969 --> 30:40.348
Here, I'll switch.

30:40.599 --> 30:42.551
- Okay, here.
- There we go.

30:53.210 --> 30:55.429
Hi. I-I'm looking for Theresa. Is she home?

30:55.430 --> 30:57.556
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Diaz won't be home until later.

30:57.557 --> 30:58.394
Can I help you?

30:58.395 --> 31:01.345
I'm... Ryan Atwood. I'm an old friend.

31:03.749 --> 31:05.825
Say hi, Daniel.

31:05.826 --> 31:07.129
Hi, Daniel.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.919
This is Theresa's kid, huh?

31:08.920 --> 31:10.984
Yeah. She's a terrific mom.

31:10.985 --> 31:13.123
I'll be sure to tell her that you stopped by.

31:13.124 --> 31:13.977
Okay.

31:13.978 --> 31:15.572
Okay. Bye.

31:30.744 --> 31:32.260
Having a good time?

31:32.261 --> 31:34.426
Yeah. It seems like everyone is.

31:34.427 --> 31:35.912
Yeah, wait till tomorrow.

31:35.913 --> 31:40.803
Come Sunday, all these people will be fighting for study carrels in the library.

31:40.921 --> 31:42.515
That's got to be tough.

31:42.516 --> 31:44.209
Not everyone can handle it.

31:44.210 --> 31:45.892
I couldn't anyway.

31:45.893 --> 31:49.498
You? Please. You're like the model freshman.

31:51.598 --> 31:53.508
You should have seen me last year.

31:54.272 --> 31:57.631
The truth is, this is my second stab at freshman year.

31:57.632 --> 31:59.824
Last go around didn't go so well.

31:59.825 --> 32:01.556
Why, what happened?

32:01.696 --> 32:03.243
Uh, let's see.

32:03.276 --> 32:06.969
1.5 GPA, too much partying.

32:07.023 --> 32:09.148
Went home after a few months.

32:09.350 --> 32:12.521
Realized I had to figure out what I wanted from college.

32:13.228 --> 32:15.044
I never would have guessed.

32:15.045 --> 32:18.259
Well, not all pre-freshman are as gung ho as you.

32:18.946 --> 32:20.628
You bought that?

32:20.698 --> 32:23.329
What, that was an act?

32:23.728 --> 32:26.260
Well, it wouldn't have been two years ago.

32:27.117 --> 32:31.432
I was the girl on yearbook, charity league, social chair--

32:31.433 --> 32:33.346
whatever my mom told me to do.

32:33.347 --> 32:35.198
I got straight As...

32:35.392 --> 32:39.472
sometimes a "B" in math, but my dad was a whiz, so he'd help me.

32:39.612 --> 32:43.517
And then on the weekends, I rode my little sister's pony for fun.

32:44.008 --> 32:46.331
I even won some blue ribbons.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.561
And then... what happened?

32:50.537 --> 32:53.560
Well, my dad lost all his money...

32:54.052 --> 32:58.074
the pony lost all its hair, and my mom kind of lost her mind.

33:00.283 --> 33:05.601
Also, I got kicked out of school, and my friend died.

33:06.901 --> 33:09.069
I guess everything happened.

33:14.656 --> 33:21.322
And then at some point, I just... stopped being the girl who belonged at college...

33:22.779 --> 33:25.042
or anywhere, for that matter.

33:28.039 --> 33:30.230
Everyone belongs somewhere.

33:32.663 --> 33:34.412
Maybe not everyone.

33:36.709 --> 33:38.921
Maybe some people just get lost.

33:44.938 --> 33:48.457
I won't know anything till I talk to Theresa. I'm just... just going to have to wait.

33:48.458 --> 33:52.059
Yeah, well, not to worry. I'm on the next flight home. I'm just waiting on my cab.

33:52.060 --> 33:54.031
Seth, you don't have to come home early on my account.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.905
Oh, there are a lot of reasons, trust me.

33:56.906 --> 33:58.532
See you when I get home.

34:05.654 --> 34:06.747
Get in.

34:06.748 --> 34:08.495
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:10.434 --> 34:12.071
Are you giving me a ride to the airport?

34:12.072 --> 34:13.007
Eventually.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.799
My plane leaves in, like, an hour or so.

34:14.800 --> 34:18.009
Well, that is just enough time to make a quick stop at RISD.

34:18.010 --> 34:20.762
You mean the Rhode Island School of Design?

34:22.320 --> 34:25.788
You're going to apply, and this is your application.

34:26.011 --> 34:27.058
Where'd you get this?

34:27.059 --> 34:29.344
I, uh... I had my mom FedEx it.

34:29.346 --> 34:31.458
You know, just in case The Ironist failed

34:31.460 --> 34:36.966
and Dr. Overbee didn't go for the quick quips and pop-culture-laden bromides.

34:37.606 --> 34:40.290
No, I have an in there: my cousin.

34:40.291 --> 34:41.165
Anna...

34:41.166 --> 34:45.533
Hmm? If you get in, you'll be in the same state as Summer,

34:45.534 --> 34:47.958
and the good news is, it is a very small state.

34:47.958 --> 34:51.025
I know, I know, but that's, like, one of the best art schools in the country,

34:51.027 --> 34:54.367
and as much as I love the face-to-face college rejection,

34:54.368 --> 34:56.541
I think I should just cut my losses on this one.

34:56.542 --> 34:58.253
- Cohen.
- Yeah?

34:58.254 --> 35:00.865
Confidence, remember?

35:03.069 --> 35:04.653
- Right.
- Good.

35:04.654 --> 35:06.522
All right, we're going to RISD.

35:08.549 --> 35:09.962
Kiki, you made it.

35:09.963 --> 35:11.668
Hey, here's the man of the hour.

35:11.669 --> 35:13.277
- It's good to see you, Neil.
- Hi, Sandy.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.858
- Hey, Julie.
- Hey.

35:14.859 --> 35:16.680
- Kirsten, you look lovely.
- Thank you.

35:16.681 --> 35:19.237
Would you ladies excuse us? Some doctors want to meet this fella.

35:19.238 --> 35:21.005
That'd be great. Excuse me.

35:25.225 --> 35:27.176
Uh-oh, what's wrong?

35:27.242 --> 35:28.531
Long story.

35:31.544 --> 35:36.373
Oh... and now you have to watch him work the crowd all night, and it's because of me.

35:36.374 --> 35:38.510
No, Julie, it's okay. I wouldn't have bailed on you.

35:38.511 --> 35:40.469
Okay, well, then let me return the favor.

35:40.470 --> 35:42.687
Come on, let's go hide out by the crab dip.

35:42.688 --> 35:45.175
Maybe we could flirt with one of the bartenders.

35:49.013 --> 35:50.884
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:51.987 --> 35:54.440
I just wanted to see if you were okay.

35:55.898 --> 35:58.708
Yeah. You, uh... you bailed early, too, huh?

35:58.881 --> 36:00.117
Yeah.

36:01.741 --> 36:03.041
Come in.

36:05.064 --> 36:06.731
So Berkeley didn't live up to the hype?

36:06.732 --> 36:09.194
Yeah, well, it's not really Berkeley's fault.

36:09.195 --> 36:10.901
I was sort of asking a lot of it.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.411
To take you away from every problem you've ever had here?

36:13.635 --> 36:15.524
Something like that.

36:20.029 --> 36:22.136
So, you don't have to tell me, but...

36:22.137 --> 36:25.284
Oh, it's Theresa. She did have a baby.

36:25.527 --> 36:27.895
- Oh, my God.
- I haven't talked to her yet,

36:27.896 --> 36:31.668
so I'm not sure... if I'm the father or not.

36:31.669 --> 36:34.497
Well, what makes you think you're the father and not Eddie?

36:36.182 --> 36:39.120
Uh, because when I was at Berkeley, I...

36:39.244 --> 36:41.858
I just felt like I was living somebody else's life,

36:42.143 --> 36:45.368
and, um, then I heard the news, and...

36:46.706 --> 36:49.851
I don't know. It's like, boom, back to being me.

36:53.785 --> 36:57.460
But when you were at Berkeley, it felt right, didn't it?

36:57.872 --> 37:00.084
I could see it on your face.

37:00.369 --> 37:01.956
Yeah, yeah, it did.

37:05.237 --> 37:07.276
Well, then you'll get back there...

37:07.593 --> 37:10.009
no matter what happens with Theresa.

37:17.875 --> 37:19.423
Hello, everyone.

37:19.424 --> 37:23.974
As the new guy in these circles, I'd like to thank Neil and Julie for inviting us here tonight,

37:23.975 --> 37:28.356
and I'd like to welcome you all to lend your talent and expertise to the new hospital,

37:28.357 --> 37:31.901
because I am going to need all the help I can get.

37:31.902 --> 37:35.923
As you know, behind every successful man is a very surprised woman.

37:35.924 --> 37:38.522
I'd like you to meet the former head of the Newport Group

37:38.523 --> 37:40.526
and really the brains behind the organization,

37:40.527 --> 37:43.182
my lovely wife, Kirsten Cohen.

37:48.716 --> 37:52.413
Kirsten, how do you think your husband is doing running the Newport Group?

37:56.547 --> 37:58.700
I guess she's still surprised.

38:01.422 --> 38:03.450
I'd like to propose a toast.

38:07.764 --> 38:09.509
To Sandy Cohen...

38:09.729 --> 38:13.504
...who has told me countless times over the last year

38:13.505 --> 38:17.170
how important this hospital is to him.

38:18.858 --> 38:20.054
Ouch.

38:21.541 --> 38:24.783
You know, they say that when you grow up, you marry your father.

38:26.149 --> 38:28.448
I thought I'd escaped that.

39:14.163 --> 39:16.628
Seth is going to Brown, and he's dating Anna?

39:16.629 --> 39:18.854
I know! Is your brain exploding?

39:18.855 --> 39:20.297
A little.

39:20.665 --> 39:23.445
- How did he explain himself?
- He didn't.

39:23.912 --> 39:26.451
Okay, well, he tried to, but you know how I get, Coop.

39:26.452 --> 39:28.817
The rage makes it hard to talk, let alone listen.

39:28.818 --> 39:31.829
Well, I mean, don't assume anything until you hear what he has to say.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.899
You don't know for sure they're dating.

39:37.882 --> 39:40.526
So how was Berkeley? Was it amazing?

39:41.268 --> 39:43.521
Yeah. I mean, it could be...

39:43.957 --> 39:45.845
if I was ready for it.

39:45.854 --> 39:47.648
I just don't know that I am.

39:47.988 --> 39:49.912
Well, I believe in you, Coop.

39:50.102 --> 39:52.890
I'll see you in eight short hours, okay?

39:53.112 --> 39:54.737
Okay. Bye.

39:57.153 --> 39:59.574
I am beyond happy for you right now.

39:59.575 --> 40:03.613
I'm like, uh, Christmas-morning, won-the-lottery level happy for you.

40:03.614 --> 40:05.426
Well, the RISD guy only said he was impressed.

40:05.427 --> 40:10.767
Mm-mm, he said very impressed, and in scenarios like these, verys are important.

40:10.851 --> 40:13.326
Well, if I get in, it's all 'cause of you.

40:13.327 --> 40:15.685
No. It's your comic book.

40:15.686 --> 40:18.104
And your plane's about to leave.

40:18.105 --> 40:20.557
Well, thank you, really.

40:27.561 --> 40:29.437
- All right.
- Okay.

40:30.285 --> 40:32.128
See you soon. Call me.

40:32.129 --> 40:33.437
Will do.

41:47.411 --> 41:48.620
Ryan.

41:52.005 --> 41:52.991
Hi.

41:54.225 --> 41:55.888
I don't know how you found me.

41:56.063 --> 41:57.616
Uh, look, I just need to know.

41:57.617 --> 41:59.227
He's not yours, Ryan.

42:01.072 --> 42:02.627
Eddie's the father.

42:03.113 --> 42:05.439
We got a paternity test and everything.

42:11.873 --> 42:14.382
I'm sorry that I wasn't honest with you,

42:14.383 --> 42:18.302
but I saw how your life opened up when you met the Cohens, and I...

42:18.303 --> 42:19.689
Is Eddie helping you out?

42:19.690 --> 42:22.083
Are you kidding? That bum.

42:22.969 --> 42:25.366
I would've, you know, for what it's worth.

42:25.367 --> 42:26.253
I know that.

42:26.254 --> 42:29.083
- Even if it hadn't have been mine.
- I know, that's why I didn't tell you.

42:30.789 --> 42:33.187
But believe it or not, I'm doing okay on my own.

42:33.188 --> 42:34.506
- Yeah, seems like it.
- Yeah.

42:34.507 --> 42:36.026
I saw the apartment.

42:36.878 --> 42:40.442
Yeah, I got a job at this hotel, and then I got promoted,

42:40.443 --> 42:44.513
and I got promoted again and again, and suddenly, I have myself a career.

42:44.514 --> 42:46.509
And a kid: Daniel.

42:46.510 --> 42:47.293
Yeah.

42:47.294 --> 42:48.504
How is he?

42:48.505 --> 42:50.386
How much time do you have?

42:50.604 --> 42:51.702
I don't know.

42:51.703 --> 42:54.402
You want to go grab a bite and tell me about him?

42:55.018 --> 42:56.699
Yeah, I'd like that.

42:56.714 --> 42:58.522
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:59.937 --> 43:02.735
- It's good to see you again, Ryan.
- Yeah, it's good to see you.
