00:18.999 --> 00:21.999
Do you know Kylie's
having an eighteenth birthday

00:21.999 --> 00:23.999
party in two weeks with, like,
300 people or something?

00:23.999 --> 00:25.999
I haven't been
invited.

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
- Me, neither.
- What a little

00:27.999 --> 00:29.999
Kylie is.
I'm calling her now.

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
- Hello.
- Hey. So I just heard

00:31.999 --> 00:33.999
you're throwing a huge birthday
bash?

00:33.999 --> 00:35.999
- I am.
- And Kourtney and I

00:35.999 --> 00:37.999
have not been invited yet.
Is there a reason why?

00:37.999 --> 00:39.999
No. I haven't told
anybody.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.999
I'm not gonna tell anybody until
I for sure know where I want it

00:41.999 --> 00:43.999
- and everything.
- Well, don't you want

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
us to hold the date?
What if we're busy?

00:45.999 --> 00:50.999
You're never gonna be
busy on my birthday.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
Wait. August 10?
I'm already busy that day.

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
I have an event on
August 10.

00:54.999 --> 00:57.999
- Where?
- San Francisco.

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
Can you fly back from
San Francisco or something?

00:59.999 --> 01:01.999
If you beg me hard
enough.

01:01.999 --> 01:03.999
What do you want me to
do?

01:03.999 --> 01:04.999
Who would you want to
come the most out of all your

01:04.999 --> 01:06.999
- sisters?
- Probably Khloe.

01:06.999 --> 01:09.999
Yeah!
Okay, I'll cancel my San

01:09.999 --> 01:11.999
- Francisco appearance.
- Ah!

01:11.999 --> 01:12.999
Did you really have
one?

01:12.999 --> 01:15.999
Wait. Should I cancel my London,
um, my London appearance?

01:15.999 --> 01:18.999
You don't have a
London appearance.

01:32.999 --> 01:34.999
So this is it.

01:34.999 --> 01:36.999
Oh, they've really
demolished.

01:36.999 --> 01:38.999
- Holy.
- And then we built that

01:38.999 --> 01:40.999
- thing at the end to put art.
- Oh, I can't believe

01:40.999 --> 01:42.999
you guys moved fully in, and now
this is happening.

01:42.999 --> 01:44.999
- It's pretty crazy.
- When are you

01:44.999 --> 01:46.999
- supposed to move in?
- December.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.999
We're remodeling our house.
There's still so much that we'd

01:48.999 --> 01:51.999
want to do to it to make it
perfect.

01:51.999 --> 01:53.999
This is what the kitchen will
kind of look like.

01:53.999 --> 01:55.999
- This is sick.
- We're hoping that it

01:55.999 --> 01:58.999
would be ready before the baby's
born, so I hope that everything

01:58.999 --> 02:02.999
sticks according to plan.
I just cannot wait to get out of

02:02.999 --> 02:04.999
my mom's.
It's been great, but they are

02:04.999 --> 02:07.999
just so loud.
Like, they don't even...

02:07.999 --> 02:09.999
I know, but it's
their house. It's not...

02:09.999 --> 02:11.999
You can't control it when you're
used to being a certain level in

02:11.999 --> 02:14.999
- your house.
- I love my mom, and she's

02:14.999 --> 02:17.999
so gracious to let us live
there, but last time we

02:17.999 --> 02:19.999
remodeled our house, you know,
we definitely had our

02:19.999 --> 02:23.999
differences.
This one has a lock on it.

02:23.999 --> 02:26.999
First, let's start out
by saying this is my closet, and

02:26.999 --> 02:27.999
- my drawer.
- And then...

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
I think you really
think that... that this is your

02:29.999 --> 02:32.999
- house.
- I cannot stay there for

02:32.999 --> 02:35.999
a long period of time, so I just
hope that we can make it a

02:35.999 --> 02:38.999
really easy, pleasant
experience.

02:38.999 --> 02:40.999
It's just really
hard with, like, a baby, and,

02:40.999 --> 02:42.999
- like, they just don't...
- You know this

02:42.999 --> 02:44.999
- already.
- ...have any

02:44.999 --> 02:46.999
- consideration?
- You know this.

02:46.999 --> 02:48.999
You've put yourself back into
the oven.

02:48.999 --> 02:57.999
Like, it's crazy.
Crazy, crazy, crazy.

02:57.999 --> 03:01.999
I'm 25 pounds up on the
scale today.

03:01.999 --> 03:04.999
Aah! And I'm only halfway there.
Last time, I gained 50, but I

03:04.999 --> 03:07.999
delivered six weeks early, and
they say you gain the most at

03:07.999 --> 03:09.999
- the end.
- Yeah, you do.

03:09.999 --> 03:11.999
- If you were full term...
- I probably would have

03:11.999 --> 03:13.999
- gained 70.
- You have to remember

03:13.999 --> 03:16.999
that you're making another human
being, and that you... you-you

03:16.999 --> 03:18.999
were able to really get in the
best shape of your life after

03:18.999 --> 03:20.999
- your baby.
- Yeah. No, I know.

03:20.999 --> 03:22.999
- I'm not worried.
- And you'll do it again.

03:22.999 --> 03:23.999
I'm not worried about
after.

03:23.999 --> 03:25.999
I'm just thinking about number
three.

03:25.999 --> 03:27.999
- Like, if I have three...
- Number three?!

03:27.999 --> 03:29.999
...then that's where I
think your body really starts to

03:29.999 --> 03:31.999
- slip.
- Whoa. Can we just slow

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
- down and have number two?
- I know.

03:33.999 --> 03:36.999
I heard that, uh...
Caitlyn is very upset...

03:36.999 --> 03:38.999
- Why?
- ...that she wasn't

03:38.999 --> 03:43.999
invited to the graduation.
First of all, it was a surprise

03:43.999 --> 03:47.999
graduation for the girls, and,
yes, their dad probably should

03:47.999 --> 03:49.999
have been there, when I think
about it in hindsight, but it

03:49.999 --> 03:52.999
wasn't malicious, and I didn't
mean to hurt anybody's feelings.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.999
Also, you guys have
separate lives now, and that's

03:54.999 --> 03:56.999
- okay.
- Yeah.

03:56.999 --> 04:01.999
I feel really bad that Caitlyn
wasn't invited to the graduation

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
- party.
- Let's talk about the

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
graduation.
Are you inviting Caitlyn?

04:05.999 --> 04:06.999
I don't think I'm
ready.

04:06.999 --> 04:08.999
I haven't even met her yet.
To be honest, I'm scared to

04:08.999 --> 04:13.999
death.
I understand why she would be

04:13.999 --> 04:17.999
upset, but on the other hand,
it's such a sensitive subject,

04:17.999 --> 04:20.999
and it's something that really
needs to be done in private.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.999
I mean, I'm just, like, I
haven't even met her yet.

04:22.999 --> 04:25.999
I don't know if I could handle
it.

04:25.999 --> 04:29.999
- I need to do it on my own terms.
- We've felt like he's had

04:29.999 --> 04:33.999
such crazy feelings towards you
in the things that he's said.

04:33.999 --> 04:35.999
I know. I don't know
how he thinks that it's...

04:35.999 --> 04:37.999
So why would he want to
come?

04:37.999 --> 04:39.999
I kind of think
sometimes, she thinks that Bruce

04:39.999 --> 04:42.999
Jenner said those things, and
Vanity Fair

04:42.999 --> 04:46.999
article.
Well, now that he's Caitlyn, he

04:46.999 --> 04:49.999
still has to take responsibility
for what Bruce Jenner said, kind

04:49.999 --> 04:51.999
of.
You know, like... like, he

04:51.999 --> 04:56.999
really hurt my feelings.
Why am I supposed to be so

04:56.999 --> 04:58.999
forgiving when we haven't even
discussed it since?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.000
- Yeah.
- You know?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
You don't have to cry
now.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.999
- She's not even here.
- I know, and just

05:04.999 --> 05:06.999
thinking about it breaks my
heart.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
I know. It just scares me a
little.

05:08.999 --> 05:11.000
- I know, but it's time.
- Yes, but it does.

05:11.000 --> 05:24.999
It's like I just... I...
I don't know. It's hard.

05:24.999 --> 05:26.999
Did you see my
Guinness Book of World Records?

05:26.999 --> 05:29.999
Uh-uh.
- That's The Guinness

05:29.999 --> 05:31.999
Book of World Records
official...

05:31.999 --> 05:34.999
- Wow.
- ...officially sent

05:34.999 --> 05:38.999
me "The Fastest Ever" to a
million followers on Twitter.

05:38.999 --> 05:43.999
And I did beat out, in the Teen
Choice Awards, Miley Cyrus,

05:43.999 --> 05:46.999
Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and
everything, for Social Media

05:46.999 --> 05:49.999
Queen.
I need to be on my phone.

05:49.999 --> 05:52.999
Oh, my God, you're a
changed woman.

05:52.999 --> 05:55.999
That's true.

05:55.999 --> 05:58.999
But, for me, it's a great way to
communicate a lot of the things

05:58.999 --> 06:00.999
- I'm trying to do.
- Can I post this?

06:00.999 --> 06:02.999
Uh, sure.
Let's get to the important

06:02.999 --> 06:05.999
stuff.
What about your birthday?

06:05.999 --> 06:07.999
Want to have your friends over
here for a party?

06:07.999 --> 06:09.999
I mean, I can throw something
here.

06:09.999 --> 06:12.999
Come on, this is a great party
house.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.999
I've been thinking
about it.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.999
I was just going to do something
with my friends.

06:16.999 --> 06:19.999
I just really don't want to deal
with the drama.

06:19.999 --> 06:22.999
- Yeah, but it's 18.
- Yeah, but...

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
You got to do
something.

06:24.999 --> 06:27.999
- Between you and Mom...
- Me and Mom what?

06:27.999 --> 06:31.999
- We're fine.
- You guys haven't even

06:31.999 --> 06:35.999
met.
I want both my parents at my

06:35.999 --> 06:41.999
birthday party, but I know that
my mom and my dad are both

06:41.999 --> 06:44.999
struggling with their
relationship, so, I just don't

06:44.999 --> 06:46.999
really want to deal with the
Mom-Dad drama.

06:46.999 --> 06:48.999
You're 18.
You can make up your own

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
decision about what you want to
do.

06:50.999 --> 06:52.999
Don't have your mom talk you
into something. Okay?

06:52.999 --> 06:55.999
No. I'm not talking to
either of you guys.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.999
Uh, by the way, I
have you a prezy.

06:57.999 --> 07:01.999
I-I only have a couple of these,
and I'm gonna give one to you.

07:01.999 --> 07:03.999
- Are you ready?
Mm-hmm.

07:03.999 --> 07:05.999
- Can you handle this?
- Mm.

07:05.999 --> 07:07.999
- Stop.
- What do you think?

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
My picture's all over 'em, and,
of course, we do have the

07:09.999 --> 07:11.999
bottoms.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.999
This is way too
inappropriate for me to wear.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.000
- I totally agree.
- I have my dad on my

07:15.000 --> 07:16.999
- underwear?
- Okay, well, I can

07:16.999 --> 07:19.999
give 'em to somebody else.
Do you want 'em?

07:19.999 --> 07:20.999
- I want them!
- Oh, of course you

07:20.999 --> 07:30.999
want them.

07:30.999 --> 07:32.999
- Kris?
- Hey, Jonathan.

07:32.999 --> 07:33.999
What's up?

07:33.999 --> 07:35.999
Hey. Taking care of
the women, man and the kids.

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
- That's about it.
- You guys look cozy.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.999
Welcome to the
playhouse.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.000
- Chillin'. We just...
- I just got back

07:41.000 --> 07:42.999
from Italy, so I didn't get my
sneakers.

07:42.999 --> 07:44.999
They're at my house waiting for
me.

07:44.999 --> 07:46.999
- You missing out.
- Jeally? Look at!

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
A little bit, yeah.
I'll have them tomorrow night.

07:48.999 --> 07:49.999
We got our Yeezys.
We're excited.

07:49.999 --> 07:51.999
Ooh, those are
nice. Yo, what up?!

07:51.999 --> 07:53.999
How was the vacay,
man?

07:53.999 --> 07:54.999
- Oh, my God.
- This house is so

07:54.999 --> 07:56.999
much quieter without Kylie,
though. This is weird.

07:56.999 --> 07:58.999
You don't have, like, 37
random kids running around.

07:58.999 --> 07:59.999
No, I just have Kim,
Kanye, North, the nanny...

07:59.999 --> 08:01.999
Right, but you know
them all.

08:01.999 --> 08:03.999
...the housekeeper, the
chef, the trainer.

08:03.999 --> 08:04.999
And with Kylie, you
have 37 people you didn't know.

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
I feel like...
Dr. Zhivago?

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
No, not this again.
Dr. Zhivago?

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
- Wait.
- She tricked me and

08:10.999 --> 08:11.999
took me on this trip, and she
wanted to stay home and watch

08:11.999 --> 08:13.999
- Dr. Zhivago.
- What the?

08:13.999 --> 08:15.999
- That's crazy.
- You guys, stop.

08:15.999 --> 08:17.999
- Stop! What?
- Shh.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
Huh? I'm telling...
What?

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
Because North is taking
a nap.

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
This is nap time, prime time.
Seriously, it's so rude.

08:23.999 --> 08:24.999
You're not serious?
She can't hear us.

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
Yeah, I am.
She's taking a nap, and her room

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
- is right there. Yes, she can.
- Yeah, her room is...

08:28.999 --> 08:30.999
Oh, she wasn't
upstairs?

08:30.999 --> 08:32.999
- Yeah.
- Oh, you're not in

08:32.999 --> 08:33.999
- the little room anymore?
- No, they took over

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
three or four bedrooms this
time.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
Oh.
And you're complaining?

08:37.999 --> 08:38.999
And then she yells at
me in my own bathroom and tells

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
- me, like, what to do and...
- You knew this was

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
gonna happen, though.
You allowed this.

08:42.999 --> 08:43.999
No, but I said to
her... I said, "I just..."

08:43.999 --> 08:45.999
- She's the boss!
- Shh.

08:45.999 --> 08:47.999
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.
- I know. We can't even,

08:47.999 --> 08:48.999
- like...
- Stop. Have some respect.

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
I'll literally kick you out of
here.

08:50.999 --> 08:52.999
I love Jonathan.
I love that he's, like, hanging

08:52.999 --> 08:55.999
out with my mom, but I have a
baby in this house.

08:55.999 --> 08:59.999
I need no one to wake her, and
they have got to shut up.

08:59.999 --> 09:02.999
- Seriously, keep it down.
- What the  is

09:02.999 --> 09:05.999
- wrong with her?
- Bend your knees, sink

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
that seat down towards knee
level.

09:07.999 --> 09:09.999
- Hi, guys. Hi, Heather.
- Uh...

09:09.999 --> 09:11.999
Are you doing
pregnant ballet?

09:11.999 --> 09:12.999
- We're doing Pure Barre.
- Pure Barre?

09:12.999 --> 09:16.999
I think it's great that Kim's
working out, but I think it

09:16.999 --> 09:19.999
would be nice if she gave me a
little heads up.

09:19.999 --> 09:22.999
What are you gonna do on your
birthday?

09:22.999 --> 09:25.999
- Why are you so funky?
- Well, between you and

09:25.999 --> 09:34.999
Caitlyn, it's just, like, I'm
not gonna not invite my dad.

09:40.999 --> 09:43.999
Before we get
started, we're gonna just show

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
you, like, some of the basic
moves that you'll be doing

09:45.999 --> 09:48.999
throughout the whole class, so,
if you're at the bar, or if

09:48.999 --> 09:51.999
you're seated, something we talk
about a lot in Pure Barre is a

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
tuck.
It's basically tightening the

09:53.999 --> 09:56.999
base of your seat and your low
abs, but you never want to arch

09:56.999 --> 09:58.999
your back.
It's gonna be hard, but it's

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
take it at your own pace.
Bend you knees, sink that seat

10:00.999 --> 10:02.999
down towards knee level.
Keep that tailbone nice and

10:02.999 --> 10:04.999
- heavy.
- I need a glass of

10:04.999 --> 10:06.999
- wine.
- Hi, guys.

10:06.999 --> 10:10.999
- Hi, Heather.
- Are you doing

10:10.999 --> 10:13.000
- pregnant ballet?
- No, we're doing Pure

10:13.000 --> 10:16.999
- Barre, a good workout.
- Pure Barre?

10:16.999 --> 10:19.999
Do you think I want
anyone to see me going into,

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
like, classes looking like a
huge cow?

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
I want to see you
lift your leg.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.999
Um, okay, well, I'm
having some people over for

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
dinner in, like, an hour.
Are you gonna be wrapped up by

10:28.999 --> 10:32.999
- then, or...?
- If I can get through it

10:32.999 --> 10:35.999
- all.
- Okay.

10:35.999 --> 10:39.999
I think it's great that Kim's
working out and staying healthy,

10:39.999 --> 10:42.999
but I think it would be nice if
she gave me a little heads up,

10:42.999 --> 10:46.999
- considering it's my house.
- Oh, yummy.

10:46.999 --> 10:48.999
So, they all moved
back.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.999
- All of 'em.
- But why couldn't

10:50.999 --> 10:51.999
- they just go to another house?
- Why would you?

10:51.999 --> 10:53.999
- Look around.
- She has a house.

10:53.999 --> 10:56.999
She has her house in Bel Air.
And then she bought this house

10:56.999 --> 10:58.999
and redid it, and then, she
redid it again.

10:58.999 --> 11:00.999
- Mm.
- And so...

11:00.999 --> 11:02.999
And Kanye just,
like, loves being here?

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
Yes. They both do.
They're never gonna leave.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
I get yelled at in my own house.
"Mom, you're making too much

11:06.999 --> 11:08.999
noise."
"Mom, you're too busy."

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999
- Oh, wow.
- I like to do things my

11:10.999 --> 11:15.999
way, so I like to set my music
and have my candles and lay out

11:15.999 --> 11:18.999
my stuff and I don't want to
have ballet class in the middle

11:18.999 --> 11:22.999
of it.
I mean, is that wrong?

11:22.999 --> 11:26.999
I love my kids and I think it's
really nice that they still want

11:26.999 --> 11:31.999
to come and even live with me,
but sometimes Kim, I think, just

11:31.999 --> 11:34.999
takes it for granted.
She needs to remember that I

11:34.999 --> 11:37.999
live here, too.
Sooner or later we're gonna have

11:37.999 --> 11:41.999
- to establish some boundaries.
- Khloe just bought

11:41.999 --> 11:43.999
the house in Tarzana, and you
said...

11:43.999 --> 11:45.999
- Thank you.
- ..."I'm glad she

11:45.999 --> 11:47.999
bought the house in Tarzana, but
I think she's gonna regret not

11:47.999 --> 11:51.999
buying in Hidden Hills."
And Kim goes, "Oh, my God, Mom,

11:51.999 --> 11:54.999
enough with the Hidden Hills!
Not everybody on Earth wants to

11:54.999 --> 11:56.999
live in the Hidden Hills.
She doesn't want to live in

11:56.999 --> 11:58.999
Hidden Hills, that's why I lived
in Beverly Hills, 'cause I don't

11:58.999 --> 12:00.999
want to live in Hidden Hills."
And then she goes and buys a

12:00.999 --> 12:02.999
Hidden Hills house and then
moves in with you, to Hidden

12:02.999 --> 12:04.999
- Hills.
- Oh, she isn't going

12:04.999 --> 12:07.999
anywhere, honey.
She'll be building on that piece

12:07.999 --> 12:10.999
of property, but she'll go, "Oh,
I think I'll change the toilet

12:10.999 --> 12:12.999
"paper holder-- can I move back
in with you?"

12:12.999 --> 12:22.999
I mean, that's how I feel that's
going on over there.

12:22.999 --> 12:25.999
This is supposed to be a really
bad rainy season.

12:25.999 --> 12:27.999
- Like, crazy.
- I'm excited.

12:27.999 --> 12:29.999
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.999
For the winter, and
winter clothes?

12:31.999 --> 12:33.999
Yeah.
And fireplaces and hot

12:33.999 --> 12:35.999
chocolate.
What do you want to do for your

12:35.999 --> 12:38.999
birthday-- you want to celebrate
and do a party?

12:38.999 --> 12:42.999
It's a big birthday.
We could do a family dinner if

12:42.999 --> 12:44.999
you want.

12:47.999 --> 12:51.999
- Why are you so funky?
- Well, between you and

12:51.999 --> 12:56.999
Caitlyn it's just like, I don't
know, you guys are weird.

12:56.999 --> 13:01.999
And then I'm not gonna not
invite my dad and invite my mom.

13:01.999 --> 13:04.999
- Or vice versa.
- I don't think you have

13:04.999 --> 13:08.999
to worry about that.
I think you have to let adults

13:08.999 --> 13:15.999
go through their thing and we'll
figure it out.

13:15.999 --> 13:20.999
To hear that Kylie has anxiety
over her dad and I-- it breaks

13:20.999 --> 13:23.999
my heart.
Especially at her birthday.

13:23.999 --> 13:28.999
So I think I have to be strong
enough to create a great

13:28.999 --> 13:33.999
relationship with Caitlyn,
because my kids' feelings are

13:33.999 --> 13:35.999
more important than my own right
now.

13:35.999 --> 13:38.999
Nothing will take the shine away
from you at your birthday.

13:38.999 --> 13:43.999
- We're not that selfish.
- I still very much

13:43.999 --> 13:45.999
love Lamar, but I need to move
forward.

13:45.999 --> 13:48.999
I don't think you really ever
have peace from walking away

13:48.999 --> 13:52.999
from any situation that you
wish, you know, ended up

13:52.999 --> 13:54.999
- different.
- Bruce was always on

13:54.999 --> 13:57.999
- time.
- Who is an hour late?

13:57.999 --> 13:59.999
- Yeah, this is rude.
- I'm starting to get

13:59.999 --> 14:01.999
nervous if she'll even show up.

14:12.999 --> 14:14.999
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:14.999 --> 14:18.999
Well, I just realized I
still have your name as, um,

14:18.999 --> 14:22.999
"Bruce" in my phone.
It's Cait.

14:22.999 --> 14:24.999
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

14:24.999 --> 14:28.999
When are we gonna
get together?

14:28.999 --> 14:30.999
Well, you have to come
over for a glass of wine one

14:30.999 --> 14:32.999
- evening.
- I could come over

14:32.999 --> 14:35.999
there or you could come over
here, I've got your wine here.

14:35.999 --> 14:39.999
Now that I know how
Kylie really feels, I think the

14:39.999 --> 14:43.999
most important thing that we can
do right now is make sure that

14:43.999 --> 14:48.999
her dad and I get along so that
the kids-- especially Kylie--

14:48.999 --> 14:51.000
never has to worry about
something like this again.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.999
Do you-do you want to join us?
We're gonna have a little dinner

14:54.999 --> 14:59.999
at Nobu to kind of kick off
Kylie's birthday.

14:59.999 --> 15:03.999
She just wants to have a little
family dinner, just her siblings

15:03.999 --> 15:08.999
and me and then you and, um,
that's it.

15:08.999 --> 15:11.999
- Okay.
- This definitely makes

15:11.999 --> 15:15.999
me nervous, but sooner or later
I'm gonna have to meet Caitlyn

15:15.999 --> 15:20.999
and right now I think the time
needs to be sooner.

15:20.999 --> 15:26.999
I just think that we have to
find a way to just be together

15:26.999 --> 15:29.999
as a family when we have
special occasions, and I think

15:29.999 --> 15:33.999
that Kylie's birthday would be a
really good place to start.

15:33.999 --> 15:37.999
- Yeah, I agree.
- So, um...

15:37.999 --> 15:39.999
We agree on
something!

15:45.999 --> 15:48.999
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

15:48.999 --> 15:50.999
How long have you had
these allergies?

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
- This morning.
- I feel like you didn't

15:52.999 --> 15:55.999
have 'em, though, when we were
doing Glam.

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
- Yeah, I did.
- Oh, she can't take

15:57.999 --> 15:59.999
none of that stuff.
'Cause of the baby.

15:59.999 --> 16:02.999
I know, but it's so
annoying.

16:02.999 --> 16:06.999
Oh, so I forgot to tell
you, I'm having Faye's wedding

16:06.999 --> 16:09.999
at... in my back yard.

16:09.999 --> 16:11.999
I'm sorry.
You were the one who wanted to

16:11.999 --> 16:13.999
move in.
You can just go to Kourtney's

16:13.999 --> 16:14.999
- house...
- How torturous.

16:14.999 --> 16:16.999
With your driveway like that?
How can you...

16:16.999 --> 16:19.999
It'll be done.
So we have to live together for

16:19.999 --> 16:23.999
quite a few more months.
And we have to make it work

16:23.999 --> 16:25.999
cohesively, do you know what
that means?

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
- With happiness...
- I'm not an idiot,

16:27.999 --> 16:33.999
- Yeah, I do.
- We have to minimize the

16:33.999 --> 16:36.999
amount of human beings in my
bathroom every morning.

16:36.999 --> 16:41.999
I think it's time to just maybe
review some of the ground rules.

16:41.999 --> 16:46.999
Kim, but...
there are definitely some

16:46.999 --> 16:49.999
boundaries.
So what else do you think would

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
help?
I got to figure out where the

16:51.999 --> 16:54.999
nursery will be, 'cause I'll
definitely have the baby at your

16:54.999 --> 16:57.999
- house.
- What, you need another

16:57.999 --> 17:00.999
- room?
- What do you want me to

17:00.999 --> 17:02.999
- do?
- Can't the baby sleep in

17:02.999 --> 17:06.999
- your room?
- Well, I mean...

17:06.999 --> 17:09.999
- Are you asking me?
- The red room should be

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
- the nursery.
- Yeah.

17:11.999 --> 17:14.999
- Clean that closet out...
- How come everyone else

17:14.999 --> 17:16.999
dictates what I do with my
closets?

17:16.999 --> 17:18.999
Do you know I haven't had my
closets to myself in, like,

17:18.999 --> 17:21.999
three years?
You guys know that, right?

17:21.999 --> 17:23.999
Like, I don't even know where my
stuff is.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.999
If you gave me a million dollars
to find something, I probably

17:26.999 --> 17:28.999
- couldn't.
- I think you just got to

17:28.999 --> 17:30.999
- get rid of some.
- This lunch was supposed

17:30.999 --> 17:32.999
to be about establishing
boundaries, and every time I...

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
It's just a boundary.
I'll take the small room.

17:34.999 --> 17:36.999
Why do I have
boundaries?

17:36.999 --> 17:39.999
It's my house.
We have to work together.

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
- We are.
- Okay.

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
I'm not taking Kendall's
room, 'cause that's your closet

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
room.

17:53.999 --> 17:57.999
Kourtney, hey,
Kourtney, over here.

17:57.999 --> 18:03.999
Hey, Kim.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
You guys, they have
watermelon lemonade.

18:05.999 --> 18:08.999
- Oh, my God.
- The pasta mama is

18:08.999 --> 18:12.999
really good, but I don't want to
entice you to get a pasta.

18:12.999 --> 18:15.999
- That sounds amazing.
- It is so good.

18:15.999 --> 18:19.999
- So, um, how is everything?
- Like, with Lamar?

18:19.999 --> 18:22.999
Mm-hmm.
- Um, I still very much

18:22.999 --> 18:27.999
love Lamar, but I need to move
forward.

18:27.999 --> 18:30.999
- Yeah.
- I feel like that's a big

18:30.999 --> 18:34.999
- step, though.
Mm-hmm.

18:34.999 --> 18:36.999
I don't think you
really ever have peace from

18:36.999 --> 18:40.999
walking away from any situation
that you wish, you know, ended

18:40.999 --> 18:43.999
up differently.
Do I know for a fact that I've

18:43.999 --> 18:47.999
done every single thing that I
could to try to save that

18:47.999 --> 18:50.999
- marriage, 100%?
- You've told him, like,

18:50.999 --> 18:53.999
"Come fix this marriage."
But I don't think he

18:53.999 --> 18:55.999
understands, and that's what's
so hard.

18:55.999 --> 18:58.999
Then I wonder, like, so what
have I been fighting for?

18:58.999 --> 19:01.999
I think filing for the divorce
is the worst thing in the world.

19:01.999 --> 19:03.999
It's the worst feeling.
You feel like you're hurting

19:03.999 --> 19:06.999
everybody.
But I need to live my life the

19:06.999 --> 19:13.999
best that I know how and do what
I feel is best.

19:13.999 --> 19:16.999
Tyga and I are
together.

19:16.999 --> 19:18.999
I guess we'll just see where it
goes.

19:18.999 --> 19:22.000
Mom invited Caitlyn to the
dinner.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.999
I just hope that we can make it
through the night without any

19:24.999 --> 19:28.999
- family drama.
- Excited, nervous.

19:28.999 --> 19:30.999
A little bit nervous,
but I feel like at the end of it

19:30.999 --> 19:33.999
I'll be really glad that I
finally met Caitlyn.

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
Well, we are here.

19:46.999 --> 19:49.999
- Khloe?
Mm-hmm?

19:49.999 --> 19:51.999
How did you injure
yourself-- by working out?

19:51.999 --> 19:53.999
Yes, it's really hard
to get in shape.

19:53.999 --> 19:55.999
Oh.

19:55.999 --> 19:57.999
You're like...
I can hear your bones, like,

19:57.999 --> 19:59.999
- creaking.
- I know.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.999
- And popping.
- So I have to cancel my

20:01.999 --> 20:06.999
workouts all this week 'cause of
scheduling.

20:06.999 --> 20:10.999
- Khloe no likey that.
- What happened with

20:10.999 --> 20:15.999
- these divorce papers on Friday?
- It takes a long time

20:15.999 --> 20:17.999
for things to go through the
system and to get in the judge's

20:17.999 --> 20:20.999
hands.
I told Laura, "Let's, like, tell

20:20.999 --> 20:23.999
the judge we need to speed this
"along, I'm not gonna do this

20:23.999 --> 20:27.999
forever."
I think of all the

20:27.999 --> 20:31.999
relationships that I've had the
privilege of being around, the

20:31.999 --> 20:35.999
one that I thought would be
forever tried and true was Khloe

20:35.999 --> 20:38.999
and Lamar.
And it breaks my heart to see

20:38.999 --> 20:42.999
all of this go on.
Khloe, I love you.

20:42.999 --> 20:44.999
I just want you to be okay.

20:55.999 --> 20:58.999
How the hell do you
wear these?

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
- I don't know.
- So why would you buy

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
them?
This is so pointless if you

21:02.999 --> 21:04.999
don't know how you're gonna wear
it.

21:04.999 --> 21:10.999
I know.
So... Mom invited Caitlyn to the

21:10.999 --> 21:13.999
dinner.
They're both gonna be there and

21:13.999 --> 21:17.999
- I'm... interested.
- I've never seen them

21:17.999 --> 21:21.999
interact together.
It's gonna be weird.

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
I know.
I want both my parents at my

21:23.999 --> 21:28.999
birthday dinner, but I'm also a
little nervous because this is

21:28.999 --> 21:32.999
the first time I'm gonna see my
mom and my dad together.

21:32.999 --> 21:36.999
I just hope that we can make it
through the night without any

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
- family drama.
- I think it's our job

21:38.999 --> 21:42.999
- to not make it awkward.
- Well, duh.

21:42.999 --> 21:46.999
I need to find an outfit for
Bootsy Bellows and Nobu.

21:46.999 --> 21:49.999
Bootsy, I picked out
my outfit.

21:49.999 --> 21:52.999
I didn't tell Dad
about Bootsy Bellows, though.

21:52.999 --> 21:56.999
I don't think I'm gonna invite
Mom or Dad because, I don't

21:56.999 --> 21:58.999
know, it's just stressing me
out.

21:58.999 --> 22:01.999
You should.
It's just nice to know, like...

22:01.999 --> 22:05.000
I'd want that peace of mind,
like, "Oh, I was invited."

22:05.000 --> 22:08.999
I don't know, it's
just stressing me out.

22:08.999 --> 22:09.999
Do you have to take
a?

22:09.999 --> 22:11.999
You're making a face like you
have to take a.

22:11.999 --> 22:14.999
- No.
- Yeah.

22:14.999 --> 22:17.999
You're so mean.
Do you remember when we were

22:17.999 --> 22:19.999
younger, growing up, we both
knew when each other, like, had

22:19.999 --> 22:20.999
- to?
- That's why I know

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
you have to take a  right
now.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
I don't, I swear to
God.

22:24.999 --> 22:27.999
If I had to, I'm not... I'm not
five again-- like, I would

22:27.999 --> 22:30.999
handle my business.

22:40.999 --> 22:42.999
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

22:42.999 --> 22:45.999
Is it sunny in

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
- here?
- No, I'm just too...

22:47.999 --> 22:51.999
- lazy to take my sunglasses off.
- Would you like me to

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
- take them off for you?
- No.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.999
You didn't hear
back from Scott, right?

22:55.999 --> 22:57.999
- No.
- He said he was

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
gonna come over last night, but
then he didn't.

22:59.999 --> 23:03.999
Do you think you'll ever
get back with Scott?

23:03.999 --> 23:07.000
I don't know.
I don't think so.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.999
- Do you miss him?
- I mean, yeah, it's

23:09.999 --> 23:13.999
hard to, like, I don't know,
just... especially, I feel,

23:13.999 --> 23:16.999
like, on the weekend, just to,
like, do stuff as a family, but

23:16.999 --> 23:20.999
I think that his life, I just,
far that he

23:20.999 --> 23:23.999
would have to go and, like, so
much work to do and...

23:23.999 --> 23:25.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:25.999 --> 23:27.999
Can I tell you what happened to
me yesterday?

23:27.999 --> 23:29.999
- Hmm?
- I looked down at my

23:29.999 --> 23:33.999
phone and it was ringing and it
FaceTime Audio.

23:33.999 --> 23:37.999
It was Lamar, and he must have
butt-dialed me and it went on

23:37.999 --> 23:39.999
- FaceTime Audio.
- Oh, what was he

23:39.999 --> 23:41.999
- saying?
- He was just telling

23:41.999 --> 23:44.999
somebody what to pack or put in
his bag, and he was preparing a

23:44.999 --> 23:48.999
little mini wardrobe together.
He's texted me a few times

23:48.999 --> 23:51.999
- recently.
- What is he texting

23:51.999 --> 23:53.999
- you about?
- You know, he talks

23:53.999 --> 23:59.999
about realizing past mistakes
and wanting a fresh start.

23:59.999 --> 24:02.999
after
the fact that Khloe filed for

24:02.999 --> 24:05.999
the fact that
she's moved on?

24:05.999 --> 24:09.999
She's so focused on
moving forward and leaving the

24:09.999 --> 24:12.999
past behind, and then when I
tell her that he's trying to

24:12.999 --> 24:15.999
reach out-- she waited for two
years for him to reach out, and

24:15.999 --> 24:17.999
- he's reaching out?
- Isn't that always how

24:17.999 --> 24:20.999
- life happens?
- Yeah.

24:20.999 --> 24:23.000
It's so sad for me.
It's almost like it pains me to

24:23.000 --> 24:27.999
tell her that he texts me.
Because it breaks my heart.

24:27.999 --> 24:31.999
It's, like, she was in so much
pain for so long and would have

24:31.999 --> 24:38.999
- given anything for that.
- Yeah.

24:46.999 --> 24:48.999
You're wearing your
ring?

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
- So lame.
- It was my 20-year

24:50.999 --> 24:54.999
- anniversary present.
- Excited? Nervous?

24:54.999 --> 24:56.999
- What's your vibe?
- A little bit nervous,

24:56.999 --> 24:59.999
but I feel like at the end of it
I'll be really glad that I

24:59.999 --> 25:04.999
finally...
met Caitlyn.

25:09.999 --> 25:12.999
Now that Caitlyn is coming to
the birthday dinner, I really

25:12.999 --> 25:16.999
feel like I should go over and
meet her, privately, in person,

25:16.999 --> 25:19.999
before I have to do that in
front of the kids-- because that

25:19.999 --> 25:23.999
would be really awkward.
I'm really grateful for Kim

25:23.999 --> 25:28.999
being here, because it prevents
me from turning around... or not

25:28.999 --> 25:31.999
going up to the front door.
I just need some closure on a

25:31.999 --> 25:35.999
couple things, especially the
article.

25:35.999 --> 25:38.999
I want to get to a place where
it just doesn't bother me and

25:38.999 --> 25:42.999
there's not this tension and
it's, like, their side against

25:42.999 --> 25:45.999
us.
I want...

25:45.999 --> 25:50.999
her to know that...
she's...

25:50.999 --> 25:55.999
you know, been very hurtful.
In order for us to move on, if

25:55.999 --> 25:59.999
she wants to be invited to
stuff... just be a decent human

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
- being, you know? Just...
- Yeah.

26:01.999 --> 26:03.999
- ...be a nice person.
- This is closure for you.

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
I think it's, like, a lot of
things, what you need to do

26:05.999 --> 26:08.999
- today.
- But I can't lie-- I'm a

26:08.999 --> 26:13.999
little bit nervous.
Bruce was super stubborn.

26:13.999 --> 26:17.999
But who knows, maybe Caitlyn's
gonna be a little different.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.999
Well, we are here.

26:21.999 --> 26:25.999
It's the big night!

26:25.999 --> 26:28.999
- I love you, bitch!
- I'm 18.

26:28.999 --> 26:31.999
- I am so excited.
- And we gonna go check

26:31.999 --> 26:36.999
out some more birthday gifts for
King Kylie.

26:36.999 --> 26:47.999
Just that first look at
surreal.

26:57.999 --> 27:01.999
- Look who's here.
- Hello! Oh, my goodness.

27:01.999 --> 27:04.999
- Look at you! Nice shoes!
- Do you like those?

27:04.999 --> 27:07.000
Yeah.
How are you? Oh...

27:07.000 --> 27:09.999
Well, I'm fine.
How are you?

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
I'm good.
I brought you some cookies.

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
Thank you.

27:20.999 --> 27:22.000
Where do you want to
go?

27:22.000 --> 27:25.999
- Sit down here.
- Okay.

27:29.999 --> 27:36.999
Just that first...
surreal,

27:36.999 --> 27:42.999
and I feel like it'll take me a
second to get my bearings, but

27:42.999 --> 27:46.999
I've got to hand it to her-- she
looks great.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.999
So...
enough of the small talk.

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
- How are you doing?
- I'm good.

27:51.999 --> 27:54.999
I'm really good.
Just working.

27:54.999 --> 27:58.999
Well, I haven't
heard from you in forever.

27:58.999 --> 28:01.999
I just felt thrown
under the bridge.

28:01.999 --> 28:07.999
I felt like you were so excited
to be going through this

28:07.999 --> 28:11.999
exciting time in your life, but
I feel like... I didn't want to

28:11.999 --> 28:14.999
communicate with you and be
angry and be... and be...

28:14.999 --> 28:17.999
What would you be
angry for?

28:17.999 --> 28:21.999
Mm, it doesn't even
think.

28:21.999 --> 28:22.999
- Yes, it does.
- No.

28:22.999 --> 28:24.999
'Cause it affects
the kids.

28:24.999 --> 28:26.999
One of the reasons I
wanted to talk to you was

28:26.999 --> 28:29.999
because I don't want your
feelings to be hurt, like when I

28:29.999 --> 28:32.999
heard that you weren't happy
about not being included in

28:32.999 --> 28:35.999
Kylie's graduation.
making

28:35.999 --> 28:40.999
making
that decision.

28:40.999 --> 28:44.999
I was so disappointed in
everybody.

28:44.999 --> 28:47.999
For 15 years of my life I
carpooled kids every day.

28:47.999 --> 28:51.999
Some days I would spend three or
four hours a day in the car.

28:51.999 --> 28:55.999
A slap in the face...
when you don't even get invited

28:55.999 --> 28:57.999
- to their graduation.
- That's exactly how I

28:57.999 --> 29:01.000
Vanity Fair
article, 'cause I... spent 25

29:01.000 --> 29:04.999
years of my life and 18 hours a
day and blah, blah, blah.

29:04.999 --> 29:05.999
was
months ago.

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
We're talking about what
happened just a few days ago.

29:07.999 --> 29:11.000
Listen, usually people
that get a divorce don't do

29:11.000 --> 29:14.999
everything together.
It wasn't malicious.

29:14.999 --> 29:16.999
It didn't intend to hurt
anybody's feelings.

29:16.999 --> 29:21.999
feelings still weren't
healed, and I thought, wow, this

29:21.999 --> 29:27.999
- is the guy that...
- when I, you know...

29:27.999 --> 29:30.999
I-I-I told myself I don't even
want to cry.

29:30.999 --> 29:33.999
But it just hurt my feelings.
What did you say? I...

29:33.999 --> 29:37.999
I "mistreated" you.
It was, like, mistreated you?

29:37.999 --> 29:40.999
Yeah, we fought like cats and
dogs for the last couple of

29:40.999 --> 29:44.999
years-- but that's not what you
article.

29:44.999 --> 29:48.999
And it just killed me.
Because it wasn't true.

29:48.999 --> 29:50.999
And that-that's just... you
know, it was, like, what

29:50.999 --> 29:54.999
happened to... just the life we
had together?

29:54.999 --> 29:56.999
It's like you don't... you just
threw that away.

29:56.999 --> 29:59.999
I don't want anybody
to feel bad.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.999
I thought I was very kind and
nice to you.

30:01.999 --> 30:04.999
I didn't say anything that was
bad.

30:04.999 --> 30:06.999
- Yeah.
- Never texted me,

30:06.999 --> 30:08.999
never said anything, never
called.

30:08.999 --> 30:11.999
I almost did, and then
article, like,

30:11.999 --> 30:17.999
literally killed me.
You're sensitive and amazing to

30:17.999 --> 30:20.999
all these new people in your
life.

30:20.999 --> 30:25.999
You're just not so sensitive and
amazing to... this side of the

30:25.999 --> 30:28.999
- family that you left behind.
- Oh... A phone call

30:28.999 --> 30:32.999
- would have been great.
- I was hoping for the

30:32.999 --> 30:36.999
best, but nothing really has
changed.

30:36.999 --> 30:42.999
I don't think I've ever met
as stubborn as Bruce

30:42.999 --> 30:48.999
- Jenner... until I met Caitlyn.
- These are, like, the

30:48.999 --> 30:52.999
- last few things he sent.
- Ma, honestly, "This

30:52.999 --> 30:54.999
dude James, is that Khloe's
boyfriend?"

30:54.999 --> 30:56.999
Mom, that's  up of you.

31:00.999 --> 31:02.999
You're sensitive and
amazing to all these new people

31:02.999 --> 31:05.999
in your life.
You're just not so sensitive and

31:05.999 --> 31:10.999
amazing to... this side of the
family that you left behind.

31:10.999 --> 31:17.999
Oh... A phone call
would have been great.

31:17.999 --> 31:19.999
My feelings don't
matter anymore. It's not...

31:19.999 --> 31:21.000
Oh, don't play the
martyr.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
- I'm not. I just don't.
- Don't play the

31:23.000 --> 31:25.999
martyr-- you don't feel "oh,
poor Kris, my feelings don't

31:25.999 --> 31:27.000
matter anymore."
I'm not "oh, poor

31:27.000 --> 31:28.999
Kris."
That's BS.

31:28.999 --> 31:32.999
Like, I'm trying to be
understanding of the way that

31:32.999 --> 31:37.999
you feel and the way that you've
made this huge change in your

31:37.999 --> 31:42.999
life, and I try to understand
you and be accepting.

31:42.999 --> 31:48.999
But you just... are more
my

31:48.999 --> 31:52.999
point of view in that, you know,
why that was hurtful.

31:52.999 --> 31:54.999
I totally disagree
with that.

31:54.999 --> 31:57.999
Some days are just...
hard.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.999
And I know you say you haven't
gone anywhere and you're still

32:00.999 --> 32:05.999
the same person, but sometimes
they just miss having...

32:05.999 --> 32:09.999
Bruce around.
We all do.

32:09.999 --> 32:11.999
How do we move

32:11.999 --> 32:15.999
- forward from this point?
- You know, obviously,

32:15.999 --> 32:19.999
it's really important for the
kids to have you as a big part

32:19.999 --> 32:22.999
of their life.
We just have to get used to our

32:22.999 --> 32:25.999
new normal.
I just want to get to a place

32:25.999 --> 32:31.999
where it's comfortable for us
to-to share celebrations

32:31.999 --> 32:35.999
together.
I think that it might take some

32:35.999 --> 32:39.999
time for Caitlyn and I to see
eye to eye and understand each

32:39.999 --> 32:43.999
other's feelings, but I think
that this is a really good first

32:43.999 --> 32:46.999
step in the right direction just
to a better relationship for the

32:46.999 --> 32:49.999
sake of the kids.

32:49.999 --> 32:51.999
Oh, my God, you want to take a
selfie?

32:51.999 --> 32:54.999
Come on.
Where's the best light?

32:54.999 --> 32:56.999
Right here.
Hey, there we go.

32:56.999 --> 32:58.999
Now, what are you gonna do with
this selfie?

33:02.999 --> 33:04.999
- Okay.
- You got lipstick all

33:04.999 --> 33:06.999
- over your cheek.
- It's all right.

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
Hey, P!
No naps today, guys?

33:18.999 --> 33:22.999
No naps today?
I'm gonna go in the kitchen.

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
- Penelope.
- You want some granola?

33:24.999 --> 33:25.999
You want some
string cheese?

33:25.999 --> 33:27.999
- No.
- You want to go with P

33:27.999 --> 33:29.999
and get a snacky?
Okay.

33:29.999 --> 33:34.999
Um, you never told
me about mom meeting Caitlyn for

33:34.999 --> 33:37.999
- the first time.
- I had to leave before.

33:37.999 --> 33:39.999
- Oh, why?
- Just 'cause I had to

33:39.999 --> 33:41.999
work.
So I was like, "I'll drive you

33:41.999 --> 33:44.999
there."
She was so nervous.

33:44.999 --> 33:47.999
We should call her.
I'm really anxious to see how

33:47.999 --> 33:52.999
everything went and, you know,
how my mom felt about, you know,

33:52.999 --> 33:55.999
seeing Caitlyn face-to-face for
the first time.

33:55.999 --> 33:57.999
Hello?

33:57.999 --> 33:59.999
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:59.999 --> 34:02.999
What happened with, uh,
your talk with Caitlyn?

34:02.999 --> 34:06.999
- Like, how did it go?
- Oh.

34:06.999 --> 34:11.999
Well, she did not have one ounce
of empathy for my feelings.

34:11.999 --> 34:15.999
Listen, I know you're very
excited and happy about your

34:15.999 --> 34:20.999
transition, and we're happy for
you.

34:20.999 --> 34:23.999
But you just have to give it a
minute and not take it so

34:23.999 --> 34:26.999
- personally.
- From my mom's tone, it

34:26.999 --> 34:30.999
doesn't really sound like they
found the common ground that

34:30.999 --> 34:32.999
they were really looking for.
I mean, I just hope that with

34:32.999 --> 34:35.999
Kylie's birthday coming up that
they're gonna be cordial with

34:35.999 --> 34:39.999
each other, 'cause, you know,
it's about Kylie, not them, and

34:39.999 --> 34:42.000
I hope they can just put their
differences aside.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.999
Well, I'm trying to
move on.

34:46.999 --> 34:49.999
I want her to be happy.
And she seems really happy.

34:49.999 --> 34:53.999
Guess what.
It's not your problem anymore.

34:53.999 --> 34:58.999
I know, but when you
really spend that much time and

34:58.999 --> 35:01.999
energy on someone for your whole
life, you know...

35:01.999 --> 35:04.000
Well, now you can
get taken care of and you don't

35:04.000 --> 35:07.999
- have to deal.
- Yeah.

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
So anyway, now you're
downloaded.

35:10.999 --> 35:12.999
- That was riveting.
- All right, guys, I love

35:12.999 --> 35:14.999
- you.
- Okay, love you.

35:14.999 --> 35:18.999
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.999
Oh, if it isn't the
birthday girl!

35:28.999 --> 35:31.999
Happy birthday.
I love you.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.999
- You look beautiful.
- Why?

35:34.999 --> 35:36.999
I love it.
Like, it's so cute.

35:36.999 --> 35:38.999
Do you want... Where do
you want to put Kourtney and

35:38.999 --> 35:40.999
Khloe?
I'll sit over here.

35:40.999 --> 35:43.999
Should we have Caitlyn
and Kris next to each other?

35:43.999 --> 35:47.999
Let's see.
Kourtney.

35:47.999 --> 35:51.999
I'll sit here.
Yeah.

35:51.999 --> 35:55.999
Caitlyn should sit over there.
I'll sit here.

35:55.999 --> 35:58.999
- And then Kourtney and Khloe.
- Okay, hold on.

35:58.999 --> 36:02.999
Thank you.

36:02.999 --> 36:05.999
Happy almost birthday,

36:05.999 --> 36:07.999
- my little munchy mix.
- You guys, Bruce was

36:07.999 --> 36:10.999
always on time, and Caitlyn is
late.

36:10.999 --> 36:16.999
She's probably working
on her hair and her look.

36:16.999 --> 36:19.999
- Can I get one more of these?
- I cannot believe my

36:19.999 --> 36:23.999
mom is acting like this.
This is exactly what I wanted to

36:23.999 --> 36:27.999
avoid with inviting both of my
parents.

36:27.999 --> 36:29.999
What time is it?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.999
Bruce was always on
time, and Caitlyn is late.

36:38.999 --> 36:40.999
Can I ask you guys a
question?

36:40.999 --> 36:45.999
Who is an hour late?
Kim, this is not even

36:45.999 --> 36:49.999
- fashionably late anymore.
- She's arrived.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.999
- There you are!
- I'm back!

36:52.999 --> 36:54.999
Why were you so
late?

36:54.999 --> 36:56.999
- That is not like you.
- I know.

36:56.999 --> 36:58.999
- I am so sorry.
- Bruce was never late.

36:58.999 --> 37:01.999
- I know. Sorry.
- Is Caitlyn more late?

37:01.999 --> 37:03.999
Yes, exactly right.
That's it.

37:03.999 --> 37:05.999
- You look so nice.
- Well, thank you.

37:05.999 --> 37:07.999
You do look really,
really nice.

37:07.999 --> 37:10.999
Thank you.
Well, I got to look good for my

37:10.999 --> 37:15.999
- girl.
- I want a selfie with...

37:15.999 --> 37:17.999
- the both of you.
- Come on, yeah.

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
- Where's Kanye?
- He's at the studio right

37:19.999 --> 37:22.999
- now.
- Oh. Working away?

37:22.999 --> 37:25.999
- Yeah.
- Ooh, does that look

37:25.999 --> 37:28.999
good.
Where did you get those

37:28.999 --> 37:30.999
- earrings?
- Mine?

37:30.999 --> 37:32.999
- Yes.
- Kim got 'em for me when

37:32.999 --> 37:34.999
- she...
- That was a million

37:34.999 --> 37:37.999
years ago?
I didn't know if they were new

37:37.999 --> 37:40.999
or not.
They look great.

37:40.999 --> 37:42.999
- Kris, Chuck Burtzloff.
- Is he out there?

37:42.999 --> 37:44.999
- What'd he say?
- Obviously, he hasn't

37:44.999 --> 37:46.999
met Caitlyn.
He comes out of the bathroom,

37:46.999 --> 37:48.999
- and there I am standing there.
- What bathroom do you

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
- use?
- Yeah, what bathroom do

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999
- you use?
- Well, I ain't going

37:52.999 --> 37:54.999
- in the guys' room.
- What?

37:54.999 --> 37:55.999
I never thought
about that.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
So do you go in the
chicks' bathroom?

37:57.999 --> 38:00.999
Of course. He's...
She's wearing a Tom Ford dress.

38:00.999 --> 38:03.000
Do you want to open a
birthday present?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.999
- Okay.
- Okay, let's start.

38:05.999 --> 38:09.999
Ooh.

38:09.999 --> 38:12.999
- So cute.
- Don't copy every pose

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
I'm doing.
Stick with the one pose I gave

38:14.999 --> 38:16.999
- you.
- Ow!

38:16.999 --> 38:18.999
- Here, Mom, come here.
- Oh, my God, that's so

38:18.999 --> 38:20.999
- cute.
- Hold on. I want to get

38:20.999 --> 38:23.999
- Mom.
- That is so cute.

38:23.999 --> 38:27.999
It's so good.

38:27.999 --> 38:32.999
- One happy family!
- Yeah. Oh, hi.

38:32.999 --> 38:35.999
What should I say with
the two parents?

38:35.999 --> 38:37.999
"The parent trap"?

38:37.999 --> 38:40.999
- I like that. Yeah.
- Yeah, it's funny.

38:40.999 --> 38:44.999
- So cute.
- I would like to just

38:44.999 --> 38:46.999
have a toast to my little
daughter.

38:46.999 --> 38:49.999
You're number ten.
Kind of sad to see my last one

38:49.999 --> 38:53.999
become an adult, but I've been
very proud of you and I love you

38:53.999 --> 38:56.999
- and happy birthday.
- Thank you.

38:56.999 --> 38:58.999
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday,

38:58.999 --> 39:01.999
baby. Yay!

39:01.999 --> 39:04.999
Make your wish!
Yes, Kylie, yes.

39:04.999 --> 39:07.999
Slay, Mother, slay.

39:07.999 --> 39:10.999
It's
Kylie's birthday.

39:10.999 --> 39:15.999
Yay!

39:19.999 --> 39:22.999
- Good job, everybody.
- I love you guys.

39:22.999 --> 39:24.999
Wait, do you know
what you want your grandkids to

39:24.999 --> 39:28.000
- call you?
- I think the less

39:28.000 --> 39:30.999
- fuss you make of it...
- Yeah. Only person

39:30.999 --> 39:34.999
that's gonna know anything is
Mason, but I don't know if he's

39:34.999 --> 39:37.999
gonna go, "Wait, that's
Grandpa."

39:37.999 --> 39:40.999
I think you just
start off with Caitlyn, yeah.

39:40.999 --> 39:43.999
- It's Caitlyn.
- Yeah.

39:43.999 --> 39:45.999
I love the fact that
Caitlyn is here at Kylie's

39:45.999 --> 39:49.999
birthday.
Bruce has been in my life since

39:49.999 --> 39:53.999
I've been four, so I have a very
strong relationship with him.

39:53.999 --> 39:56.999
And Caitlyn is still our father
figure.

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
- How's Lamar doing?
- He sounds good

39:58.999 --> 40:00.999
sometimes.
I don't know.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.999
If he's not making any actual
progress, then I have to move

40:02.999 --> 40:05.999
- on.
- I totally agree.

40:05.999 --> 40:07.999
I mean, it took a lot
for me to, like, file for

40:07.999 --> 40:10.999
- divorce, but I had to.
- Sorry to hear it.

40:10.999 --> 40:13.999
- Yeah, but it's okay.
- These are, like, the

40:13.999 --> 40:17.999
- last few things Lamar sent.
- Mom, why are you

40:17.999 --> 40:21.999
- texting him?
- I'm just saying.

40:21.999 --> 40:23.999
"This dude James, is
that Khloe's boyfriend?"

40:23.999 --> 40:25.999
Then she said, "I don't think
so.

40:25.999 --> 40:27.999
Don't believe... I don't know
him, but don't believe all the

40:27.999 --> 40:30.000
you read."
Mom, that's  up of you.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Why would you say that about
James?

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
Are you okay? Seriously?
You're like a psychopath.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.999
Ooh...
Things haven't changed.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.999
Well, it's so good to see
everybody.

40:41.999 --> 40:43.999
Okay, so we need to
know...

40:43.999 --> 40:46.999
- Oh, no. Okay. What?
- Why were you late?

40:46.999 --> 40:48.999
- Why was I late?
- Yeah.

40:48.999 --> 40:51.999
- A really good excuse.
- Because it's a

40:51.999 --> 40:53.999
woman's prerogative to be a
little late.

40:53.999 --> 40:55.999
- How's that? Was that good?
- Khlo, do you want

40:55.999 --> 40:57.999
to go?
'Cause I have to go.

40:57.999 --> 40:59.999
Yeah, I have to go,
too.

40:59.999 --> 41:05.999
I'm gonna go to the
bathroom.

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
Well, it's down to
the two of us.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.999
How did we get to this
point?

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
Our last one is 18,
honey.

41:11.999 --> 41:14.999
- Yep.
- Thank God.

41:14.999 --> 41:18.999
Well...

41:18.999 --> 41:21.999
Come on, we can shake up the
paparazzis if we leave together.

41:21.999 --> 41:23.999
- Okay.
- Yeah.

41:23.999 --> 41:25.999
- Should we hold hands?
- Maybe.

41:25.999 --> 41:30.999
Uh, Jenner, hold on to me.

41:30.999 --> 41:32.999
- What's up?
- I can't walk.

41:32.999 --> 41:35.999
Everyone got along at
dinner.

41:35.999 --> 41:38.999
Give me a hug.
Love you.

41:38.999 --> 41:41.000
What better way to
ring in my birthday than with my

41:41.000 --> 41:44.999
- mom and my dad?
- See you guys later.

42:03.999 --> 42:05.999
King Kylie, happy
birthday.

I got a Ferrari?
This is so crazy.

43:00.999 --> 43:06.999
I literally had no idea.
Tyga is just the most selfless,
