00:34.910 --> 00:37.079
Michelle is 15 years old.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.664
Forgive me if this feels
a little irresponsible.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.583
It's irresponsible to let our son--

00:40.666 --> 00:41.959
- I can't--
- What?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.919
You can't keep
calling "her" a "him."

00:44.002 --> 00:46.338
- Really? This again?
- What else...

02:13.133 --> 02:16.344
Think of a line, a straight line
coming across your elbow, your wrist.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.556
Oh, way late, dude.
She doesn't have all night.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.975
Sorry. Did I miss anything?

02:22.059 --> 02:24.394
No. We waited for you. Come on.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.948
We couldn't have imagined
what interdimensional travel looked like

02:37.032 --> 02:38.366
any more than we could have imagined

02:38.450 --> 02:42.245
the blood on the floor
rolling back into Scott Brown's body.

02:43.872 --> 02:44.957
But we believed.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.170
<i>Two years passed in captivity.</i>

02:51.088 --> 02:53.631
<i>Scott had given us the third movement.</i>

02:53.716 --> 02:55.425
<i>Renata, the fourth.</i>

03:03.183 --> 03:04.184
You have it?

03:04.267 --> 03:06.061
Once more. Once more.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.860
<i>In Renata's NDE,</i>
<i>her guardian told her</i>

03:12.943 --> 03:16.321
<i>one of the side effects</i>
<i>of dimensional travel is amnesia.</i>

03:16.404 --> 03:19.199
<i>You could potentially forget</i>
<i>everything from before.</i>

03:23.328 --> 03:26.706
<i>So we invented symbols</i>
<i>to record the movements.</i>

03:27.332 --> 03:29.501
<i>Just like music is recorded in notes.</i>

03:37.425 --> 03:38.593
Do you want to take a break?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.055
No.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.099
Keep going.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.728
Once more.

04:01.491 --> 04:05.162
<i>Homer has the second</i>
<i>and fourth movement on his back.</i>

04:05.787 --> 04:09.040
<i>And I have the first and the third.</i>

04:10.876 --> 04:13.545
We figure the scars are a map
we can never lose.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.052
Can I touch it?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.972
Yeah. It doesn't hurt anymore.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.485
Why didn't you just let yourself die?

04:37.569 --> 04:40.072
- And stay in your NDE?
- It wouldn't have worked.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.034
The best way to think about it
is like this...

04:46.578 --> 04:50.290
There are all these dimensions,
worlds, alternate realities,

04:50.373 --> 04:52.334
and they're all
right on top of each other.

04:52.417 --> 04:57.923
Every time you make a choice, a decision,
it forks off into a new possibility.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.051
They're all right here, but inaccessible.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.677
The NDEs were like...

05:02.760 --> 05:05.472
a way to travel through them,
but temporarily.

05:06.849 --> 05:10.477
We wanted... choices, chances.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.064
The movements would allow us
to travel to a dimension permanently.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.315
Stay there.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.526
A new life... in a new world.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.030
To us, that was freedom.

05:23.031 --> 05:26.409
What will it look like when we open
the tunnel to the other dimension?

05:28.829 --> 05:31.164
I don't know. I've never done it.

05:32.040 --> 05:36.003
-What?
-All I know is that it would be invisible.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.922
The person leaving this dimension

05:39.006 --> 05:41.174
would experience
a great acceleration of events,

05:41.258 --> 05:43.426
but no break in time-space.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.054
It's like jumping
into an invisible current

05:46.138 --> 05:48.848
that just carries you away
to another realm, but...

05:48.932 --> 05:50.642
we had to have all five movements

05:50.725 --> 05:52.727
and we had to do them
with perfect feeling.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.438
But you never did it?

05:59.692 --> 06:01.653
Every movement we received...

06:02.820 --> 06:04.822
the Angel Hunter received as well.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.624
One, two.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.750
Face.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.127
Elbow.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.047
<i>We were locked</i>
<i>in a strange race with our captor.</i>

06:20.922 --> 06:24.509
<i>Right above us,</i>
<i>Hap was learning each movement on his own.</i>

06:25.760 --> 06:30.057
<i>The question became, what would happen</i>
<i>if we got the fifth movement?</i>

06:31.016 --> 06:34.186
<i>Could we keep it away from Hap</i>
<i>long enough to make our escape?</i>

06:43.946 --> 06:46.656
<i>It had been a year</i>
<i>since Renata had returned with the fourth.</i>

06:50.285 --> 06:52.704
<i>Rachel was never given a movement.</i>

06:54.414 --> 06:58.793
<i>We kept trying,</i>
<i>but secretly I started to wonder...</i>

07:00.003 --> 07:02.047
<i>would we ever get the fifth movement?</i>

07:03.840 --> 07:05.883
<i>At least we had each other.</i>

07:06.926 --> 07:10.013
<i>- Hap was all by himself.</i>

07:11.556 --> 07:14.684
<i>There was only one man</i>
<i>he could share his secret with.</i>

07:19.231 --> 07:21.066
<i>I've been having this dream, Leon.</i>

07:21.149 --> 07:23.777
It's dark. I'm low to the ground.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.362
Suddenly, there's this snap.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.198
And I look down... and my leg's in a trap.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.325
And I realize...

07:30.408 --> 07:31.576
I'm a rat.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.247
I'm a scientist
and I dream of being a rodent.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.332
Don't blame yourself
if it wears on you.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.834
We're not dealing with plants.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.462
I told you the same thing
when you were my trainee in residency

07:42.545 --> 07:43.964
and you lost your first patient.

07:44.047 --> 07:47.050
I remember.
This is different. This...

07:47.134 --> 07:50.512
I mean, quite apart from
the intellectual rigor, the...

07:50.595 --> 07:52.472
-the physical labor...
-Endless.

07:52.555 --> 07:56.726
...and the need to maintain the ecosystem
to support the...

07:56.810 --> 07:57.978
Test subjects?

07:58.061 --> 07:59.896
...there's the guilt, some days.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.439
Don't you find? Guilt?

08:01.523 --> 08:02.857
A given.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.322
Huh.
Looks exactly the same as the old one.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.409
I needed a bigger space
to fit the new capacity.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.244
I thought it would be difficult to find,

08:14.327 --> 08:17.622
but, really, this entire wing
of the hospital is dead.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.583
A janitor comes in on Thursdays,
and I simply lock the door.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.462
Where are the subjects?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.507
In the next room.

08:31.136 --> 08:36.391
So... the other day
I found myself feeling, uh... resentful.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.643
-That ever happen to you?
-Mmm.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.812
My subjects seem... so united.

08:40.895 --> 08:44.857
They... have this tribalism
that sustains them somehow.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.652
-Uh, is this clean?
-Yeah.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.947
Rituals. Mutilation.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.492
Attempts to explain existence,
to control pain.

08:54.576 --> 08:58.038
Yeah, I know all that, but I still...

08:59.039 --> 09:01.666
I couldn't help feeling
outside of it all, somehow.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.001
You are on the outside.
Stay there.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.630
Well, I mean, in some ways
we work together, no?

09:09.466 --> 09:12.969
Lab partners go home at night.
Subjects sleep in the experiment.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.475
How do you not get attached?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.645
I enforce turnover. You know this.

09:23.855 --> 09:26.524
Potassium chloride.
Then into the incinerator.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.026
Another perk
of having my lab in a hospital.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.195
Yeah, right.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.281
It changes everything. Trust me.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.579
I realize that our work is, uh...

09:39.662 --> 09:41.038
about a paradigm shift.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.208
Like Copernicus' revelations that...

09:43.291 --> 09:45.794
that Earth is not at the center
of the solar system.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.338
-Mmm.
-Life is not at the center of...

09:48.421 --> 09:50.465
-human existence.
-Mmm.

09:50.548 --> 09:54.427
But I can't help wondering if Copernicus,
the man, not the scientist...

09:55.470 --> 09:57.555
if he would have pursued that truth...

09:58.765 --> 10:02.935
if his work involved...
experimenting on human beings.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.688
It's a useless comparison.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.442
Here's the terrible, beautiful truth.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.779
No one cares.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.782
There is no line between good and evil.
There's only what a man can stand.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.701
RÃ¶ntgen killed his own wife
discovering the X-ray.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.038
My advice?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.792
Uncover what you can,
destroy the evidence...

10:26.959 --> 10:29.796
and turn a profit before you can
no longer forget how you've done it.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.966
You should know...

10:36.719 --> 10:37.845
I'm on the brink.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.267
-Really?
-Maybe a year, year-and-a-half,

10:42.350 --> 10:45.770
and I'll be able to offer
incontrovertible proof of an afterlife.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.068
What do you mean by that? "Afterlife"?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.820
Nothing spiritual. More like a...

10:54.779 --> 10:57.073
a greater reality, another dimension.

10:57.824 --> 11:02.412
Imagine the worldwide sigh of relief
when I reveal that the answer to death

11:02.495 --> 11:03.913
is more life?

11:04.789 --> 11:07.334
How many nightmares will end then,
my friend?

11:08.960 --> 11:12.755
I will reshape the world in a single click
the day I publish.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.637
Do you have an opposing theory?

11:21.348 --> 11:22.599
Come on, Hap.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.518
Friction improves the work.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.853
Share.

11:30.273 --> 11:36.946
I think what we're dealing with, maybe,
is not a single dimension.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.074
I think it's multiple.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.702
The Many-Worlds theory?

11:42.785 --> 11:44.161
Well, no, not exactly.

11:44.246 --> 11:49.125
More like, uh, reality forking off
into a different path.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.044
No, look...

11:52.295 --> 11:56.090
imagine a garden of forking paths.

11:56.174 --> 12:00.261
So, my subjects have
touched on them in their NDEs, but now...

12:00.345 --> 12:03.932
now, Leon, they are uncovering
a technology of movement

12:04.015 --> 12:06.726
that-that could allow them to travel
to different dimensions,

12:06.809 --> 12:07.935
maybe even stay there.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.439
And what's...

12:11.523 --> 12:14.526
What's really exciting is that
I think I know where they go.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.945
I think I know specifically
where my subjects go to.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.739
Maybe even what we're all a part of.

12:20.532 --> 12:21.741
Where do they go?

12:21.824 --> 12:24.076
What do you mean, "a part of"?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.703
Well, I don't wanna say yet.

12:25.787 --> 12:28.706
I mean, I don't know for sure.
I wanna... I wanna go there first.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.042
I could give a shit about profit,
with respect.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.543
I just, I want...

12:32.627 --> 12:35.672
God, I want to taste the truth.
I just wanna walk out of the dark.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.885
God, I'm sorry, I'm getting carried away.
It's probably all bullshit,

12:40.968 --> 12:43.846
and you're right and our work
will spur each other on.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.725
And then some young, smart,
better person than us will come along.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.268
And he, or she, probably, will...

12:49.352 --> 12:51.354
They'll be the one
to build on our back-breaking work,

12:51.438 --> 12:53.523
and switch the light on. Right?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.733
It's science. So it goes.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.236
Your confidence in your work
makes me proud.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.825
Since we're being open...

13:05.076 --> 13:07.662
can I share something unusual with you?

13:07.745 --> 13:09.706
-Please.
-Come.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.960
The cold chamber,
on the far wall. Open it.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.505
-Which one?
-In the center, number 20.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.243
What am I looking at?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.080
Leon?

13:53.541 --> 13:55.543
Where are your subjects traveling to?

13:57.629 --> 13:59.255
What have you uncovered, Hap?

14:00.172 --> 14:01.340
What are you doing, Leon?

14:04.594 --> 14:05.637
Tell me!

14:05.720 --> 14:07.054
I can't.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.309
Leon, put it down.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.853
You're not gonna--

14:16.355 --> 14:18.900
Tell me!

14:32.872 --> 14:35.708
All my fucking work.

14:35.792 --> 14:36.959
My life!

14:45.968 --> 14:47.178
Stop!

14:47.261 --> 14:48.596
Leon, just stop!

14:54.769 --> 14:55.770
Stop!

15:12.537 --> 15:13.663
Oh, fuck.

15:37.729 --> 15:38.771
Excuse me.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.982
Call the police.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.568
Give them that for access
to the abandoned morgue.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.611
There are people there that need help.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.279
Sir?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.617
Sir? What do you mean "people"?

16:47.423 --> 16:49.008
I hope you know
I've always thought of you,

16:49.091 --> 16:51.844
well, all of you as collaborators, but...

16:53.095 --> 16:56.307
you, most of all,
I like to think of as a partner.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.600
Don't.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.313
And I know we're both worried
about the same thing.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.570
Will we ever find the fifth movement?

17:09.486 --> 17:10.988
One of us will get it.

17:11.072 --> 17:12.990
And what then?
What will you do with it?

17:13.074 --> 17:16.911
You and Homer will live
fat, free and happy

17:16.994 --> 17:19.163
in some different version of this world?

17:20.832 --> 17:22.291
You don't want that.

17:23.793 --> 17:27.213
You'll always be the girl
willing to risk everything

17:27.296 --> 17:29.966
for the chance to achieve
something extraordinary.

17:31.759 --> 17:35.179
I know you, Prairie.
He'll never understand that about you.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.561
I have a proposal for you.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.856
We leave... tomorrow.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.483
We suspend the work,
we take the first two movements,

17:47.567 --> 17:49.193
which we know can heal.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.113
We set up a clinic somewhere remote,
an island maybe.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.656
And we cure the incurable.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.243
And the world's wealthiest,
we take their money, our technology,

17:57.326 --> 17:59.036
and we continue the work in secret.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.412
And the others?

18:02.623 --> 18:04.333
I'll take... That's a detail.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.710
I will take care of them.

18:06.628 --> 18:07.670
What happened?

18:08.462 --> 18:10.089
Who did that to your head?

18:12.008 --> 18:13.593
Something happened.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.514
I had to protect the work.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.975
I did what I had to do.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.772
Prairie...

18:27.564 --> 18:28.565
Please...

18:30.151 --> 18:32.153
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.826
I will not go with you.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.261
Khatun?

21:06.307 --> 21:07.850
Where are you?

21:15.399 --> 21:16.608
Khatun?

21:21.030 --> 21:22.865
We need the fifth movement.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.992
Khatun?

21:25.076 --> 21:26.743
Please help.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.214
Khatun!

21:50.559 --> 21:52.854
I can't get warm.

21:52.937 --> 21:57.024
Well, you will. Your body temperature
dropped to hypothermic levels.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.776
Now, there was a sound.

21:59.861 --> 22:03.072
There wasn't anything.
I didn't see anyone or hear any--

22:03.155 --> 22:07.118
I heard something very faint,
very low frequency,

22:07.201 --> 22:10.246
but I... I managed to track it,
isolate it.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.164
I need your help. What I need you to do--

22:12.248 --> 22:15.292
I can't. I don't want to.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.045
I am not your lab partner.
I am not your friend.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.881
I'm your slave.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.466
You want to know what happens
on the other side?

22:22.549 --> 22:24.844
Put yourself in that machine
and die for it.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.221
I know you're exhausted.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.556
So, I'll make it very easy for you.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.184
I'm just gonna play you some sounds
of where I think you may have been,

22:32.268 --> 22:33.810
and you tell me if you recognize them.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.521
All right? So, how about this?

22:37.523 --> 22:39.608
I told you I didn't go anywhere.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.152
This?

22:44.738 --> 22:46.991
Please just take me
back to my cell.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.120
Or this?

22:56.292 --> 22:59.045
I knew it.
You see? There was a sound.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.671
So what? You record our NDEs.

23:00.754 --> 23:03.132
No, no, no, that's...
That's not a recording of your NDE.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.217
That's a recording of, um...

23:05.301 --> 23:07.719
waves of electrons captured in plasma

23:07.803 --> 23:11.807
by a machine of great sensitivity that has
traveled way beyond the heliosphere.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.684
Decades. But...

23:13.767 --> 23:17.354
You know, it takes years
to reap the rewards, right?

23:22.944 --> 23:25.571
The rings of Saturn.

23:26.738 --> 23:27.949
They sing.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.576
That's where you were.

23:42.379 --> 23:45.382
I don't think Khatun's gonna give us
the fifth movement.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.636
I don't think she wants him to have it.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.388
We will get it.

23:55.726 --> 23:56.768
We will get it.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.356
When we were in the lab,
he confided in me.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.442
He was really scared.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.195
He talked about wanting to leave.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.948
I think he may have killed someone.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.325
He talked about
wanting to take me with him.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.623
I don't know,
maybe I should have said yes.

24:17.706 --> 24:20.167
In exchange for your freedom.
For everyone's freedom.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.835
Don't talk like that.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.009
I don't think there's another way
to talk, Homer.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.055
It's like we've reached
some sort of dead end and...

24:33.722 --> 24:36.767
determination just isn't enough, and...

24:38.644 --> 24:39.853
Fuck.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.357
What did we think
was gonna happen, anyway?

24:44.441 --> 24:45.442
We thought that...

24:47.278 --> 24:48.654
We don't know.

24:52.116 --> 24:55.911
Show up on some other
plane of reality and...

24:57.621 --> 24:59.415
...do what exactly?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.337
We're gonna have a garden.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.424
A what?

25:10.008 --> 25:11.009
Yeah.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.804
We're gonna plant vegetables.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.852
I don't want to plant vegetables.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.854
Fine. I'll plant 'em.

25:24.148 --> 25:27.025
Celery. Squash. Peas.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.862
Come on.
We don't know anything about vegetables.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.198
They'd all die.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.575
You're right.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.202
They die.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.873
There wasn't enough rain.
We, um...

25:43.625 --> 25:46.044
We planted them too close together.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.964
Not enough soil. Yeah, they die.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.051
So we try again.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.391
The second year, there's rain,

25:59.475 --> 26:02.394
and we get the spacing right...

26:02.478 --> 26:03.812
but these mites come.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.232
They eat 'em all up.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.365
Their leaves are like tissue paper.

26:14.448 --> 26:16.158
And they can't feel the sun.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.369
Yeah.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.622
But the third year?

26:23.874 --> 26:25.709
We grow this, um...

26:26.585 --> 26:28.920
like, uh, a special...

26:30.881 --> 26:34.885
A nettle plant...
in between the vegetables.

26:36.470 --> 26:39.348
The mites hate that shit,
so they stay away.

26:44.395 --> 26:45.396
And the rain comes.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.276
And the rain comes.

27:14.175 --> 27:16.593
Hap, your door's open.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.264
I'm just coming in, okay?

27:21.348 --> 27:22.349
Hap.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.435
Hap.

27:28.897 --> 27:29.940
What...?

27:42.328 --> 27:43.329
Hap.

27:44.246 --> 27:45.247
Hap.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.208
<i>Michelle?</i>

27:48.083 --> 27:49.376
Michelle?

27:51.378 --> 27:52.671
Michelle?

27:55.382 --> 27:56.633
Buck?
