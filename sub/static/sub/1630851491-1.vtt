WEBVTT

00:04.462 --> 00:05.296
(dice thudding)

00:05.296 --> 00:06.256
(electronic whirring)

00:06.256 --> 00:08.800
- (groans) Yeah.
- We play and call it work!

00:08.800 --> 00:10.969
(electronic whirring)
(groaning continues)

00:10.969 --> 00:13.888
(intense thudding)

00:16.265 --> 00:18.018
(leaves rustling)
- Ahoy!

00:18.018 --> 00:19.728
Looky what we got here.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.274
Headripper, cut his lights.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.861
(leaves crunching)
(Drustan exhales loudly)

00:27.861 --> 00:30.780
(leaves continue crunching)

00:30.780 --> 00:33.700
(dramatic instrumental music)

00:33.700 --> 00:34.951
Oi!

00:34.951 --> 00:37.370
Oh, I've seen this face before.

00:37.370 --> 00:41.082
What do you think he's
thinking in his little brain?

00:41.082 --> 00:43.251
- An orc with a brain bigger than a man's?

00:44.085 --> 00:45.170
Quite the conundrum.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.463
(Mograh yells)
(blow thudding)

00:46.463 --> 00:48.506
- If I wanted to hear your talk,

00:48.506 --> 00:50.300
I'd rip it out your face,

00:50.300 --> 00:51.676
and smack against me sword!

00:53.470 --> 00:54.888
Ain't that right, Headripper?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.973
(Headripper growls)

00:56.973 --> 00:59.142
Do you know why he's called Headripper?

00:59.142 --> 01:00.935
(Headripper growls)
You see,

01:00.935 --> 01:01.936
when people talk,

01:01.936 --> 01:04.397
and he don't understand them gits,

01:04.397 --> 01:06.191
he thinks rippin' their heads off

01:06.191 --> 01:09.360
makes 'em easier to understand.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.988
He ain't the sharpest tool.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.573
Ain't that right, Headripper?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.825
(Headripper growls)

01:15.825 --> 01:18.036
- You talk lot for an orc.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.371
(gasps) I suppose you have a brain?

01:20.371 --> 01:21.206
(Mograh groans)
Is that what I

01:21.206 --> 01:22.624
should call you then?

01:22.624 --> 01:24.209
Brain, does it work?

01:25.585 --> 01:27.253
(Drustan gasps)

01:27.253 --> 01:31.800
- Clearly one as civilized as yourself

01:31.800 --> 01:35.470
must have heard of Mograh the Merciless?

01:35.470 --> 01:36.429
- Him,
(Headripper growls)

01:36.429 --> 01:37.806
I've heard of.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.140
You, I'm afraid not.

01:40.140 --> 01:42.227
(Mograh yells)
(leaves rustling)

01:42.227 --> 01:44.771
- Oi, do you fight in a den?

01:44.771 --> 01:46.815
(armor clatters)
Stupid pea brain!

01:46.815 --> 01:48.608
Must I do everything me self then?

01:48.608 --> 01:49.567
(blow thuds)
(Headripper groans)

01:49.567 --> 01:51.945
(intense dramatic music)
Lazy moppet!

01:51.945 --> 01:55.073
You stay here and watch this dog.

01:55.073 --> 01:55.907
(leaves crunching)

01:55.907 --> 01:57.241
(blow thuds)
(Drustan groans painfully)

01:57.241 --> 01:58.283
(leaves continue crunching)

01:58.283 --> 01:59.702
(bag clatters)

01:59.702 --> 02:01.496
(leaves continue crunching)

02:01.496 --> 02:02.664
(blow thuds)
(Headripper growls)

02:02.664 --> 02:05.542
Yes, Master, find the Bloodstone I will.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.169
Search every village in
the Grimmock Mountain.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.588
Oi, I'm no moppet.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.632
(leaves crunching)

02:12.632 --> 02:14.342
(Headripper growls)
(blow thuds)

02:14.342 --> 02:16.094
(intense dramatic music)

02:16.094 --> 02:17.971
(stuffed animal rustles)

02:17.971 --> 02:19.556
(objects clattering)

02:19.556 --> 02:20.890
(book thuds)

02:20.890 --> 02:21.724
(pendant clanks)

02:21.724 --> 02:22.976
(bag rustles)

02:22.976 --> 02:26.396
(intense dramatic music)

02:28.022 --> 02:30.817
(Mograh sighs)

02:30.817 --> 02:31.901
(intense dramatic music continues)

02:31.901 --> 02:32.735
Ranger.

02:33.862 --> 02:34.779
(leaves rustling)

02:34.779 --> 02:36.698
- [Drustan] 'Twas in
this moment, I realized,

02:36.698 --> 02:39.951
the search for my daughter
may have come to an end.

02:39.951 --> 02:43.163
Was all my waiting and tracking in vain?

02:43.163 --> 02:46.082
I'd been bested by this vile creature.

02:47.041 --> 02:50.170
Mograh may have been an orc,

02:50.170 --> 02:53.798
but an exceptionally
clever orc he truly was.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.425
Perhaps, by design?

02:55.425 --> 02:58.970
A by-product of dark wizardry indeed.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.471
If 'twas my end,

03:00.471 --> 03:02.098
I knew in my heart,

03:02.098 --> 03:05.059
in the afterlife, I
could tell my sweet Reina

03:06.895 --> 03:08.521
I tried to avenge her.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.608
(dark ominous music)

03:13.026 --> 03:16.779
(suspenseful dramatic music)

03:34.756 --> 03:38.676
(whimsical instrumental music)

03:40.929 --> 03:42.138
(arrow shuffling)

03:42.138 --> 03:43.640
(bow creaks)

03:43.640 --> 03:48.394
(whimsical instrumental music continues)

03:58.696 --> 03:59.822
(bow creaks)

03:59.822 --> 04:01.241
(arrow whooshing)

04:01.241 --> 04:05.995
(whimsical instrumental music continues)

04:09.249 --> 04:11.918
(blade tapping)

04:15.755 --> 04:18.716
(intense whooshing)

04:18.716 --> 04:22.178
(blade continues tapping)

04:22.178 --> 04:26.266
(whimsical instrumental music continues)

04:26.266 --> 04:28.601
(blade continues tapping)

04:28.601 --> 04:31.479
(intense whooshing)

04:31.479 --> 04:36.234
(whimsical instrumental music continues)

05:03.261 --> 05:06.973
(blade continues tapping)

05:06.973 --> 05:10.393
(intense dramatic tones)

05:11.519 --> 05:14.063
- Daddy, don't leave!

05:14.063 --> 05:15.231
- Reina, love, you know daddy must do

05:15.231 --> 05:17.150
as the king orders, right?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.484
And besides, who else will be the eyes

05:18.484 --> 05:21.154
and ears of Lieutenant Brander Noke?

05:21.154 --> 05:21.988
- He's hairy, though.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.823
- Yes, indeed, he is.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.199
Quite a hairy man, isn't he?

05:26.409 --> 05:28.453
And you know who else will be there?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.079
Flynt Tanner.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.080
He'll have daddy's back.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.123
- Big man.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.709
- Indeed, he is.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.712
And let's not forget Corser, daddy's mate.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.630
I served with him since basic.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.549
- I'll miss you, Daddy.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.637
(dramatic instrumental music)
(whimsical tones)

05:46.637 --> 05:49.307
(blade tapping)

05:50.933 --> 05:52.310
(intense whooshing)

05:52.310 --> 05:54.562
(blade continues tapping)

05:54.562 --> 05:57.940
(intense dramatic music)

05:59.359 --> 06:01.861
(footsteps pattering)

06:01.861 --> 06:06.115
(intense dramatic music continues)

06:10.036 --> 06:13.373
(somber dramatic music)

06:59.710 --> 07:02.505
(leaves rustling)
- Oi, Headripper.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.049
Feelin' like your king of the castle then?

07:05.049 --> 07:07.427
Hackin' and sackin' defenseless pasties.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.387
Oi!
(armor thuds)

07:09.387 --> 07:10.221
(Headripper growls)

07:10.221 --> 07:11.973
(armor clangs)

07:11.973 --> 07:14.016
Feelin' sensitive, are we?
(Headripper growls)

07:14.016 --> 07:17.353
That sack of skulls ain't doin' it for ya?

07:17.353 --> 07:21.232
Oh, I ain't tryin' to steal your loot.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.192
Or maybe I is.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.028
(bag clatters)

07:26.028 --> 07:29.991
Who was it who found them
pasties in the village?

07:29.991 --> 07:30.867
Me!

07:30.867 --> 07:34.370
Who was it that got himself
ambushed by rangers?

07:35.538 --> 07:37.123
Oh, that's right!

07:37.123 --> 07:38.207
You!

07:38.207 --> 07:39.250
What's that, Master?

07:39.250 --> 07:42.128
I'm the smartest orc you've ever seen?

07:42.128 --> 07:44.714
Why, you're too kind, Master.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.382
What's that?

07:46.382 --> 07:49.010
You've got a message for Headripper?

07:49.010 --> 07:49.886
Pea brain!

07:49.886 --> 07:50.678
(Headripper growls)

07:50.678 --> 07:52.638
Forget you're worthless trophy skulls,

07:52.638 --> 07:54.557
and find the Bloodstone!

07:54.557 --> 07:58.227
Oh, and do whatever
Mograh the Merciless says,

07:58.227 --> 08:01.022
'cause he's smarter than you.

08:01.022 --> 08:06.027
(sighs loudly) Time to tell
the Master we've got no slaves,

08:06.903 --> 08:08.863
no trophies,
(skull thuds)

08:08.863 --> 08:10.281
and no Bloodstone.

08:11.115 --> 08:15.912
He will skewer us and feed
us to the fire breather.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.748
(Headripper growls loudly)

08:18.748 --> 08:19.790
(dramatic instrumental music)

08:19.790 --> 08:22.627
- [Drustan] Everything reminds me of her,

08:22.627 --> 08:24.587
the Jays singing,

08:24.587 --> 08:26.589
tree branches dancing in the wind.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.843
Orc raiding parties have
scoured my home village

08:30.843 --> 08:32.595
in the Grimmock Mountains.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.597
Alone on the outskirts of the Short Hills,

08:35.597 --> 08:37.433
I track the wretched green skins

08:37.433 --> 08:40.186
responsible for killing my family.

08:40.186 --> 08:44.232
My daughter's body never recovered.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.067
Only a tear from her dress.

08:47.109 --> 08:50.655
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

08:50.655 --> 08:51.906
(pencil scratching)
My brother rangers

08:51.906 --> 08:54.617
inform me these orcs are slavers.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.620
I suspect Reina to be with them.

08:58.579 --> 09:02.667
They had better pray not a
single scratch be on her!

09:02.667 --> 09:03.584
(scroll rustles)

09:03.584 --> 09:07.171
I hold a hawk-delivered-letter
from Lieutenant Wolf.

09:07.171 --> 09:11.092
I fear his orders will be to
abandon my daughter's search

09:11.092 --> 09:13.594
and fall back in the ranks.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.680
Time is my greatest enemy now.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.849
I hope orders align with my will.

09:21.102 --> 09:24.188
- [Lieutenant Noke] Drustan,
I hope this letter reaches you

09:24.188 --> 09:26.774
by the time you return to your village.

09:26.774 --> 09:30.027
Our brothers in the north have
trapped the orcs responsible

09:30.027 --> 09:32.530
for the destruction of your home.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.533
You'll find them in the Short Hills.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.244
Through their bravery and inquisition,

09:38.244 --> 09:41.872
they discovered the true
motive behind their pillaging.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.960
One, simply known as the Master,

09:45.960 --> 09:49.463
has ordered them to find the Bloodstone.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.300
At this point, little else is known.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.136
For the rest of our brothers,

09:55.136 --> 09:56.345
the time to seek out

09:56.345 --> 09:59.140
and extinguish the orcs
who raided your village

09:59.140 --> 10:01.100
has come to a halt.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.769
We've just received
orders from Count Thriese

10:03.769 --> 10:07.189
to eliminate trolls in
the The Bickerburg Hills

10:07.189 --> 10:09.900
I understand if choose to stay behind

10:09.900 --> 10:12.903
and pursue the orcs
who slewed your family.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.115
We can fend off the trolls without you.

10:17.325 --> 10:21.537
Revenge may seem a satisfying conquest.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.372
Just remember, killing the orcs

10:23.372 --> 10:28.377
won't replace the feelings
of loss that pain your soul,

10:28.586 --> 10:32.340
but will serve as a good
distraction in the interim.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.676
Be wary of the one they call Mograh.

10:35.676 --> 10:40.139
He and his companion take
orders directly from the Master,

10:40.139 --> 10:44.226
not infamous for enslaving
and toying with prisoners.

10:45.353 --> 10:49.065
May your loved ones reach
the heavens in peace.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.025
Lieutenant Brander Noke.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.445
(ominous dramatic music)

10:56.656 --> 10:57.865
(apple thuds)

10:57.865 --> 11:00.993
(leaves crunching)

11:00.993 --> 11:04.413
(intense dramatic music)

11:12.129 --> 11:13.381
(bear rustles)
(leaves crunching)

11:13.381 --> 11:14.548
(taps bag)

11:14.548 --> 11:16.092
(footsteps pattering)

11:16.092 --> 11:19.845
(suspenseful dramatic music)

11:30.731 --> 11:32.733
- [Drustan] A dispute amongst them.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.318
(armor clangs)

11:34.318 --> 11:35.945
(feet clomping)

11:35.945 --> 11:37.988
There's only two sets of tracks,

11:37.988 --> 11:38.906
not a third.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.784
Perhaps, the large one
decided to carry Reina.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.328
(leaves rustling)

11:44.328 --> 11:47.498
(eerie ominous music)

11:53.170 --> 11:54.004
No.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.844
(intense whooshing)

12:01.220 --> 12:02.471
(Drustan groans angrily)

12:02.471 --> 12:03.305
No!

12:06.225 --> 12:09.145
(footsteps pattering)

12:09.145 --> 12:12.565
(intense dramatic music)

12:13.649 --> 12:15.067
Die creature!

12:15.067 --> 12:16.026
(bow creaking)

12:16.026 --> 12:18.028
(Headripper groans)

12:18.028 --> 12:19.572
(blade clanks)

12:19.572 --> 12:21.323
Your soul is deep.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.283
(bow creaks)

12:22.283 --> 12:23.117
(arrow whooshing)

12:23.117 --> 12:24.201
By order of the King,

12:24.201 --> 12:25.786
(Mograh thuds)

12:25.786 --> 12:27.413
you will die for your sins!

12:28.414 --> 12:29.248
(arrow whooshing)

12:29.248 --> 12:31.625
(arrow clanks)

12:31.625 --> 12:33.002
(leaves rustling)

12:33.002 --> 12:37.256
(intense dramatic music continues)

12:42.887 --> 12:44.972
(Drustan screams)

12:44.972 --> 12:46.766
(armor clanks)

12:46.766 --> 12:48.142
- Oh, fresh meat.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.810
(Headripper growls)

12:49.810 --> 12:52.146
Oh, invitin' him for
afternoon tea sounds better?

12:52.146 --> 12:52.980
(Headripper growls)

12:52.980 --> 12:53.939
Of course, we kill him!

12:53.939 --> 12:55.149
You stupid git.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.901
(Headripper growls)

12:56.901 --> 12:59.445
But first, we slave him.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.238
(Headripper growls loudly)

13:01.238 --> 13:02.865
It's settled then.

13:02.865 --> 13:06.368
(Headripper growls)

13:06.368 --> 13:10.247
(ominous dramatic music)

13:10.247 --> 13:13.167
(leaves crunching)

13:14.794 --> 13:19.048
(ominous dramatic music continues)

13:35.606 --> 13:39.401
- [Drustan] Two arrows
'tis all it would take.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.114
(leaves crunching)

13:44.114 --> 13:48.035
(ominous dramatic music continues)

13:48.035 --> 13:49.161
- I think that pasties
is in the woods with us.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.748
You heard him squeal a klick back.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.876
- [Drustan] Those heinous
creatures deserve to die.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.629
(Headripper growls)

13:58.629 --> 14:01.841
- I say we find him, slave him,

14:01.841 --> 14:04.510
and bring him back to the boss man.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.346
(Headripper growls)

14:07.346 --> 14:09.265
- [Drustan] I could end it now.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.975
I could avenge Reina.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.561
- Bring him back to the boss' lair

14:13.561 --> 14:16.522
after we squeeze him for the Bloodstone.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.233
- [Drustan] But knowing
where the Master is

14:19.233 --> 14:20.568
could be paramount.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.902
(Headripper growls)

14:21.902 --> 14:23.779
- Oh, you've got a better plan, then?

14:23.779 --> 14:24.864
- Decide!
(arrow screeches)

14:24.864 --> 14:27.283
- I don't think he's got it, stupid!

14:27.283 --> 14:29.285
But he might know where it is!

14:29.285 --> 14:30.119
- [Drustan] Avenge your daughter,

14:30.119 --> 14:33.289
or possibly save many lives?

14:33.289 --> 14:34.832
(Headripper growls)

14:34.832 --> 14:35.790
- Oh, shut it, you!

14:37.918 --> 14:39.503
(exhales loudly)

14:39.503 --> 14:42.172
(pants heavily)

14:45.426 --> 14:46.635

(arrows clatter)

14:50.472 --> 14:52.349
(ominous dramatic music)

14:52.349 --> 14:53.225
- [Drustan] Please don't hurt me.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.184
- Ahoy!

14:54.184 --> 14:55.978
Looky what we got here.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.939
(bow clatters)

14:58.939 --> 15:01.442
Headripper, cut his lights.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.735
(leaves crunching)
(dark ominous music)

15:02.735 --> 15:05.279
(blow thuds)
(Drustan groans)

15:05.279 --> 15:07.865
Oi, I've seen this face before.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.285
(Mograh yells)
(Drustan thuds)

15:11.285 --> 15:12.244
All right,
(armor clatters)

15:12.244 --> 15:13.621
you find it then.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.455
(armor clatters)

15:14.455 --> 15:15.372
Stupid pea brain!

15:15.372 --> 15:17.416
Must I do everything me self then?

15:17.416 --> 15:19.376
(armor clatters)
(Headripper grunts)

15:19.376 --> 15:20.836
Lazy moppet.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.839
You stay here and watch this dog.

15:23.839 --> 15:24.673
(leaves crunching)

15:24.673 --> 15:25.507
(blow thuds)
(Drustan groans painfully)

15:25.507 --> 15:27.217

(leaves crunching)

15:30.471 --> 15:31.805
(blow thuds)
(Headripper growls)

15:31.805 --> 15:32.806
(intense dramatic music)

15:32.806 --> 15:34.892
(leaves crunching)

15:34.892 --> 15:37.102
(Headripper growls)
(blow thuds)

15:37.102 --> 15:39.772
- (groans loudly) I'd be angry as well

15:39.772 --> 15:41.607
if I were treated like you.

15:41.607 --> 15:42.441
But surely, you must realize

15:42.441 --> 15:45.694
you're more powerful than
Mograh the Messiness?

15:45.694 --> 15:46.570
(Headripper growls)
And I know

15:46.570 --> 15:47.738
you're smarter than he.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.700
Your reputation precedes your greatness.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.868
(bag clatters)

15:52.868 --> 15:53.702
(pendant clanks)

15:53.702 --> 15:55.204
(bag clatters)

15:55.204 --> 15:58.040
(leaves rustling)

15:58.958 --> 16:01.001
(Mograh sighs loudly)

16:01.001 --> 16:02.753
(leaves crunching)

16:02.753 --> 16:04.254
- Ranger.

16:04.254 --> 16:06.048
(leaves crunching)
No.

16:06.048 --> 16:10.552
- Mograh is only merciless
because of you, Headripper.

16:12.388 --> 16:16.266
- Oh, think you're pretty
clever then, Ranger?

16:16.266 --> 16:19.353
Headripper, this one's an orc hunter.

16:19.353 --> 16:23.190
Hold him still, so I cam pluck
him right between the eyes

16:23.190 --> 16:26.235
with his own arrow.
(arrow scratching)

16:26.235 --> 16:27.695
Well, what you waitin' for?

16:27.695 --> 16:28.529
Move!

16:28.529 --> 16:29.613
You lazy moppet!

16:29.613 --> 16:32.199
(Headripper growls loudly)

16:32.199 --> 16:33.325
(bow thuds)

16:33.325 --> 16:37.913
(gasping) Headripper, I'm sorry.

16:37.913 --> 16:38.789
Don't.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.165
(Mograh speaks indistinctly)
(leaves rustling)

16:41.165 --> 16:42.543
(arrow clatters)

16:42.543 --> 16:44.169

(arrow scratching)

16:45.879 --> 16:46.714
(Headripper grunts)

16:46.714 --> 16:47.715
Stop what?

16:47.715 --> 16:49.216
Calling you stupid?

16:49.216 --> 16:51.468
But you are stupid, you mindless bog!

16:51.468 --> 16:53.053
(Headripper growls)

16:53.053 --> 16:54.930
(arrow scratching)

16:54.930 --> 16:57.141
Oi, I'm not your enemy.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.851
(Headripper growls)

16:58.851 --> 17:00.227
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:00.227 --> 17:02.813
I know where we can
get more trophy skulls,

17:02.813 --> 17:04.356
more than you can count!

17:06.025 --> 17:08.569
Well, maybe more than that.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.529
(Headripper growls loudly)

17:10.529 --> 17:13.281
Lets keep this pasties
for ourselves, yeah?

17:13.281 --> 17:15.200
Forget about the Master.
(leaves rustling)

17:15.200 --> 17:16.492
Oh, come on, boy!

17:16.492 --> 17:19.246
Don't you remember all
the good kills we had?

17:19.246 --> 17:20.372
(bow creaking)

17:20.372 --> 17:22.040
Oi, the pasties free!

17:23.876 --> 17:24.792
- For my daughter!

17:25.669 --> 17:26.502

17:28.172 --> 17:29.006
(Drustan yells)

17:29.006 --> 17:29.965
(feet shuffling)
- Watch it.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.050
Watch it now.

17:31.050 --> 17:31.884
(Drustan grunts)
(armor clangs)

17:31.884 --> 17:32.843
(armor thuds)

17:32.843 --> 17:34.511
You're dead now pastie.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.345
(bow whooshing)

17:35.345 --> 17:36.180
(leaves crunching)
(feet shuffling)

17:36.180 --> 17:37.806

17:37.806 --> 17:40.768
Your lower than the dirt,
killing an innocent child!

17:40.768 --> 17:43.187
(leaves rustling)

17:43.187 --> 17:44.855
(Headripper grunts)

17:44.855 --> 17:45.981

17:47.608 --> 17:48.442
(armor thuds)

17:48.442 --> 17:50.861

(leaves rustling)

17:53.363 --> 17:54.406
(Drustan grunts)

17:54.406 --> 17:56.241

17:56.241 --> 17:57.826
(Drustan groans)
(armor thuds)

17:57.826 --> 17:59.620
they make a perfect supper

17:59.620 --> 18:00.579

(leaves rustling)

18:00.579 --> 18:01.622
(Drustan wincing painfully)

18:01.622 --> 18:03.499
right before a good killin'.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.583
(leaves rustling)

18:29.733 --> 18:30.567
(blade continues whooshing)
(feet shuffling)

18:30.567 --> 18:34.071
Surrender, and we'll
only chop you into bits.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.365
- You creatures will
have your just reward!

18:36.365 --> 18:37.282
- Enough!

18:37.282 --> 18:38.117
(Headripper growls)

18:53.215 --> 18:55.968

18:57.886 --> 18:59.138
Oi, Headripper,

19:00.013 --> 19:01.849
should be tell this git

19:01.849 --> 19:04.351
his little, pastie girl is still alive?

19:04.351 --> 19:05.394
(intense dramatic tones)
(breathes heavily)

19:05.394 --> 19:07.354
Oh, that's right,

19:07.354 --> 19:09.481
we didn't gut her like you think.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.942
We sold her to them Outlanders.

19:11.942 --> 19:15.737
(chuckles) Your vengeance is in vain.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.198

(blade clanks)

19:32.588 --> 19:33.714
(Mograh thuds)

19:33.714 --> 19:35.340
You will never find her.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.594
The Master will use her
for his dark purpose.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.806
She will be lost forever.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.391
You will-
(blade clangs)

19:50.230 --> 19:51.315

19:51.315 --> 19:54.401
- I will find her, creature.

19:54.401 --> 19:58.530
And when I do, she will be as pure

19:58.530 --> 20:01.950
and unscathed as the day she was born.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.121
Reina, wherever you are,

20:08.081 --> 20:09.541
daddy's coming for you.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.420
Don't lose hope, child.

(Traveler yells)

22:09.328 --> 22:11.038
You dare steal from a Ranger!

22:11.038 --> 22:12.581
- I wasn't stealing!

22:12.581 --> 22:14.249
- I'm a protector of the Borderlands.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.793
I save vagrants like you.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.295
- I just want food.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.422
- So you can live to steal another day?

22:20.422 --> 22:23.675
- No Ranger, I am hungry, nothing more.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.136
- You from these parts?

22:27.095 --> 22:27.929
- Mostly.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.932
- Then point me to the Outlanders.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.728
- Head west from here.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.646
The forest is crawling with them.

22:36.646 --> 22:37.564
- And their camp?

22:38.607 --> 22:40.192
- You'll never find them.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.027
No one has.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.072
- I'm not your average tracker, Vagrant.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.823
(leaves crunching)

22:46.823 --> 22:48.033
- I'm not a vagrant.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.911
(bag rustles)
More of a wandering traveler.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.746
(Traveler grunts)
(apple thuds)

22:52.746 --> 22:53.830
(arrows clatter)
(leaves crunching)

22:53.830 --> 22:55.290
Much gratitude, Ranger.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.251
What will you do when you find them?

22:58.251 --> 23:00.253
(coat thuds)
- Take it, it's yours.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.923
(cloak rustles)

23:04.049 --> 23:06.843
(leaves crunching)

23:06.843 --> 23:09.262
- This man has a death wish.
(eerie suspenseful tones)

23:09.262 --> 23:14.267
(dramatic instrumental music)
(water lapping)

23:17.896 --> 23:22.192
- My brother, why such a betrayal?

23:22.192 --> 23:24.111
You were unmatched as our leader.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.904
Could you not let the spoils of war

23:25.904 --> 23:28.365
satisfy your need for retribution?

23:28.365 --> 23:30.784
But instead, you became weak.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.871
You chose a natural born enemy
as your companion in life.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.124
Why, Brother?

23:38.417 --> 23:40.210
- You got greedy, Henrik.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.796
We are protectors of the realm,

23:42.796 --> 23:44.965
not thieves, nor bandits.

23:45.841 --> 23:49.761
You (spits) shame us.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.179
- [Henrik] And who shall provide for us,

23:51.179 --> 23:53.014
if not ourselves?

23:53.014 --> 23:56.560
The King's hand has never
cared for us, nor executed law.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.395
We are the law, Bjorn!

23:58.395 --> 24:00.063
We dictate how we survive!

24:00.063 --> 24:00.897
- And the orcs,

24:02.065 --> 24:03.692
trading with green skins?

24:04.651 --> 24:05.902
Tell me, Brother,

24:06.945 --> 24:11.741
how is it just to have
captives mend your clothes

24:11.741 --> 24:13.410
and cook your meat?

24:13.410 --> 24:14.870
(Henrik groans)
(blow thuds)

24:14.870 --> 24:17.038
- This could have been yours, Brother.

24:17.038 --> 24:17.873
We need you.

24:18.957 --> 24:22.127
Lead us to the spoils and
riches you once promised.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.296
(suspenseful dramatic music)

24:24.296 --> 24:26.214
- You're right, Henrik.

24:26.214 --> 24:27.466
I did promise you riches.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.385
(Bjorn pants heavily)

24:30.385 --> 24:31.970
But that was before

24:31.970 --> 24:34.723
you were tainted by
the forces of darkness!

24:34.723 --> 24:37.100
(headbutt thuds)
(Henrik groans painfully)

24:37.100 --> 24:38.143
(Bjorn grunts)
(blow thuds)

24:38.143 --> 24:40.729
(feet shuffling)

24:40.729 --> 24:42.022
(Outlander grunts)
(blow thuds)

24:42.022 --> 24:43.231
(hay rustles)

24:43.231 --> 24:47.819
(suspenseful dramatic music continues)

25:00.207 --> 25:05.003
(arrows rattling)
(footsteps pattering)

25:05.003 --> 25:09.591
(suspenseful dramatic music continues)

25:14.596 --> 25:19.601
(arrows rattling)
(footsteps pattering)

25:19.726 --> 25:20.977
(hands thud)
- What?

25:20.977 --> 25:22.771
(armor clanks)

25:22.771 --> 25:23.897
(muffled groaning)
(body thuds)

25:23.897 --> 25:25.440
(Drustan grunts)

25:25.440 --> 25:27.192
(bow thuds)
(Outlander groaning)

25:27.192 --> 25:28.860
(feet shuffling)

25:28.860 --> 25:31.947
(swords unsheathing)

25:35.325 --> 25:37.077
(sword whooshing)
(metal clangs)

25:37.077 --> 25:38.745
(suspenseful dramatic music)

25:38.745 --> 25:40.664
(leaves crunching)

25:40.664 --> 25:41.665
(pats armor)

25:41.665 --> 25:45.544
(suspenseful dramatic music continues)

25:45.544 --> 25:46.836
(sword clanks)

25:46.836 --> 25:48.421
(footsteps pattering)

25:48.421 --> 25:50.131
(Drustan groans)
(blow thuds)

25:50.131 --> 25:50.966
(Outlander yells out painfully)

25:50.966 --> 25:51.800
(leaves crunching)

25:51.800 --> 25:53.385
(stick thuds)
(Drustan groans)

25:53.385 --> 25:54.886
(Outlander grunts angrily)

25:54.886 --> 25:55.720
- Come on!
- No!

25:55.720 --> 25:56.555
(foot thuds)
(Outlander groans)

25:56.555 --> 25:57.639
(leaves rustling)

25:57.639 --> 25:59.307
(Outlander yells)
(chains rattling)

25:59.307 --> 26:02.686
(Outlander grunts)
(body thuds)

26:02.686 --> 26:03.520
(dagger unsheathing)

26:03.520 --> 26:06.022
(air whooshing)
(sword clanking)

26:06.022 --> 26:07.482
(body thuds)

26:07.482 --> 26:08.441
(leaves rustling)

26:08.441 --> 26:12.445
(triumphant instrumental music)

26:22.414 --> 26:24.291
- I swear to you,

26:24.291 --> 26:25.709
I will let you live,

26:26.585 --> 26:27.877
just tell me,

26:27.877 --> 26:30.171
(triumphant instrumental music continues)

26:30.171 --> 26:33.633
(leaves gently rustling)
where's my daughter?

26:33.633 --> 26:35.927
- [Outlander] I'll die before I tell you!

26:38.221 --> 26:39.347
(Drustan grunts)
(Outlander groans)

26:39.347 --> 26:41.391
(triumphant instrumental music continues)

26:41.391 --> 26:42.392
(sword clanks)

26:42.392 --> 26:47.230
(triumphant instrumental music continues)

26:51.943 --> 26:54.571
(whimsical tones)

26:54.571 --> 26:56.448
- [Drustan] The time is running out.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.907
I've been searching for Reina

26:57.907 --> 27:00.994
out here in the Borderlands far too long.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.038
I've lost track of the weeks.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.372
I feel I'm close,

27:04.372 --> 27:08.209
but all progress seems to
be halted by Outlanders,

27:08.209 --> 27:09.294
who would rather meet death

27:09.294 --> 27:12.922
than give up their base of operations.

27:12.922 --> 27:16.384
It's as if they're protected
by a dark shroud of evil.

27:16.384 --> 27:21.389
Mograh the Merciless, the
vial, wretched orc scum,

27:22.307 --> 27:26.895
sold her to the Outlanders
right before I killed him.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.938
She is but a child.

27:28.938 --> 27:31.066
A sweet innocent.

27:31.066 --> 27:34.694
A gift from the heavens
from a supreme creator.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.655
And I still have no more clues

27:36.655 --> 27:39.282
regarding this precious Bloodstone.

27:39.282 --> 27:42.369
I'd sacrifice my beating heart for it

27:42.369 --> 27:44.871
if it meant the life of my sweet Reina.

27:45.705 --> 27:50.043
I am a powerless nothing.
(pencil scratching)

27:50.043 --> 27:53.129
(dark ominous music)

27:59.344 --> 28:04.349
(Caraphinneth chants
in a mystical language)

28:05.517 --> 28:10.522
(grass rustling)
(eerie ominous tones)

28:11.940 --> 28:16.945
(Caraphinneth continues
chanting in a mystical language)

28:24.119 --> 28:27.789
(dark ominous music swells)

28:29.082 --> 28:32.752
(leaves crunching)

28:32.752 --> 28:35.797
(bones cracking)
(Mograh groans)

28:35.797 --> 28:39.092
- [Mograh] (sighs) Oh, I
see the leaves are back.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.635
(spits loudly)

28:40.635 --> 28:42.095
'Bout time you showed up.

28:42.095 --> 28:45.223
- Mograh, we have Bloodstone to find.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.934
- You mean to tell me,
after all this time,

28:47.934 --> 28:50.770
we still haven't found
this cursed Bloodstone?

28:50.770 --> 28:55.275
My ever reliable elven
necromancer, Caraphinneth,

28:55.275 --> 28:57.485
I though you were resourceful?

28:57.485 --> 28:59.863
- Nei, I do as the Master orders.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.448
- (sighs) He's a moppet.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.743
(whimsical tones)
(ominous dramatic music)

29:04.743 --> 29:07.912
(footsteps pattering)

29:15.503 --> 29:16.755
(bow creaking)

29:16.755 --> 29:17.881
- I hear you creature.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.508
Present yourself.

29:20.508 --> 29:22.469
Don't toy with me, creature.

29:22.469 --> 29:25.013
I can pick up your scent a mile away.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.765
State your purpose in following me,

29:26.765 --> 29:28.099
and mind your words,

29:28.099 --> 29:29.517
or they may just be your last.

29:29.517 --> 29:31.519
- I am Sharia Gethyra.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.897
I am not your enemy.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.315
I've been following your
death trail of Outlanders

29:35.315 --> 29:37.901
for the last 13-
- 13 1/2 miles.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.319
Yes, I know.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.195
Why?

29:40.195 --> 29:42.363
- I come to seek out the
Watcher of the Woods.

29:42.363 --> 29:43.907
- I'm afraid you have the wrong man.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.992
- There is about one
ranger in these parts,

29:45.992 --> 29:47.869
and that ranger is you.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.662
You can track these Outlanders,

29:49.662 --> 29:51.414
but you cannot defeat them alone.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.583
I know you're searching
for someone you've lost.

29:53.583 --> 29:54.959
You're a soldier,

29:54.959 --> 29:57.337
trained is his tactical advantage.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.880
I'm offering aid.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.840
Be wise and take it, human.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.217
- Outlanders taking captives

30:02.217 --> 30:04.260
is common knowledge in these parts.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.429
Clearly, I'm in search of someone.

30:06.429 --> 30:08.139
And Watcher of the Woods?

30:08.139 --> 30:10.350
One look at my crest
tells you I'm a ranger.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.519
Your description of me as a soldier

30:12.519 --> 30:16.147
is as generic as driftwood
floating down the Cassian River.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.399
- No, Ranger, I do know you.

30:18.399 --> 30:20.318
You're a protector of the realm.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.653
- As are all rangers.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.238
Now, be on your way, creature!

30:23.238 --> 30:24.614
Do not follow me!

30:24.614 --> 30:25.740
- Think this through.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.450
They have her.

30:27.450 --> 30:29.035
They have your daughter.

30:29.035 --> 30:32.956
(ominous dramatic music)

30:32.956 --> 30:34.707
- [Drustan] I beg your pardon?

30:34.707 --> 30:37.293
- You've been tracking these
Outlanders for weeks now.

30:37.293 --> 30:39.170
I know exactly where they are.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.631
Join me, and together we can defeat them.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.259
- How dare you use my daughter

30:44.259 --> 30:46.427
in attempts to sway my purpose!

30:46.427 --> 30:49.264
I don't know you from a stone in my shoe.

30:49.264 --> 30:53.518
I do not wish to sleep with
one eye and one ear open!

30:53.518 --> 30:55.728
Stop your pursuit!

30:55.728 --> 30:56.980
You'd only slow me down.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.190
I do not care for your aid!

30:59.190 --> 31:01.276
Do not follow me, creature!

31:01.276 --> 31:03.319
- Stop calling me creature!

31:03.319 --> 31:06.072
You will learn to appreciate
my generosity, human!

31:07.532 --> 31:10.535
(ominous dramatic music)
(grass rustling)

31:10.535 --> 31:11.828
(Sharia exhales loudly)
(rock rustles)

31:11.828 --> 31:13.454
- Have it your way, She-elf.

31:13.454 --> 31:16.958
(dramatic instrumental music)
(bow whooshing)

31:16.958 --> 31:19.752
(Sharia groans)
(blows thudding)

31:19.752 --> 31:21.838
(blows continue thudding)

31:21.838 --> 31:23.590
(Drustan grunting)

31:23.590 --> 31:26.092
(blows continue thudding)

31:26.092 --> 31:27.010
(Drustan groans)

31:27.010 --> 31:27.844
(blows thudding)
(Sharia grunts)

31:27.844 --> 31:29.804
(blows continue thudding)
(Drustan grunting)

31:29.804 --> 31:31.014
(Sharia yells)
(arrows clattering)

31:31.014 --> 31:32.390
(blows thudding)

31:32.390 --> 31:34.893
(Drustan grunts)
(air whooshing)

31:34.893 --> 31:37.520
(arrows clattering)
(blows thudding)

31:37.520 --> 31:39.397
(Drustan grunts)
(Sharia thuds)

31:39.397 --> 31:40.565
(sighs loudly)

31:40.565 --> 31:41.399
(air whooshing)
(arrows clattering)

31:41.399 --> 31:43.610
(Drustan grunts)
(blows thudding)

31:43.610 --> 31:47.447
(dramatic instrumental music)

31:48.698 --> 31:52.201
- Remove your head from the
sand, Ranger, and join me.

31:52.201 --> 31:54.162
- I've misjudged you, Elf.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.830
Your skills are, indeed, expert,

31:56.831 --> 32:00.585
but my resolve to find my
daughter alone is firm.

32:01.628 --> 32:05.715
Seek the Watcher of the Woods no longer.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.842
You will only find solitude in your quest.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.263
(cloak rustling)

32:12.263 --> 32:15.433
(footsteps pattering)

32:15.433 --> 32:16.476
(cloak rustles)

32:16.476 --> 32:19.145
(air whooshing)

32:20.146 --> 32:23.900
(pensive instrumental music)

32:43.002 --> 32:46.047
(water gently lapping)
(footsteps pattering)

32:46.047 --> 32:50.635
(pensive instrumental music continues)

32:55.139 --> 32:56.474
- [Crickitus] We've
got the child, She-elf.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.267
It's the Outlander way!

32:58.267 --> 33:00.520
(dramatic instrumental music)

33:00.520 --> 33:01.604
(Crickitus groans)

33:01.604 --> 33:03.231
(gear clattering)

33:03.231 --> 33:04.399
(footsteps pattering)
(Crickitus groans)

33:04.399 --> 33:05.233
(Sharia grunts)
(hand thuds)

33:05.233 --> 33:06.067
- Wait!

33:06.067 --> 33:06.901
He can tell us more!

33:06.901 --> 33:08.569
- Kindly remove your hand, Ranger!

33:08.569 --> 33:10.446
(Crickitus groans)
(leaves crunching)

33:10.446 --> 33:11.531
(Crickitus grunts)
(sword clangs)

33:11.531 --> 33:13.241
(sword unsheathing)
(Sharia yells)

33:13.241 --> 33:14.242
(Crickitus continues groaning)
(elbow thuds)

33:14.242 --> 33:15.076
(feet shuffling)
(Sharia grunts)

33:15.076 --> 33:16.077
(Drustan groans)
(sword clanks)

33:16.077 --> 33:16.953
(Crickitus yells)
(Drustan thuds)

33:16.953 --> 33:17.954
(footsteps pattering)
- Stop!

33:17.954 --> 33:18.788
(Sharia groans)

33:18.788 --> 33:19.622
(Crickitus yells)
(ax whooshing)

33:19.622 --> 33:20.873
(foot thuds)
Get him!

33:20.873 --> 33:22.458
(Sharia groans)

33:22.458 --> 33:23.292
No!
(blade clanking)

33:23.292 --> 33:27.547
(skin squelching)
(blade clanks)

33:27.547 --> 33:28.381
(Crickitus groans)

33:28.381 --> 33:30.425
Where is my daughter?

33:30.425 --> 33:32.427
May your final act be noble

33:32.427 --> 33:34.762
from one warrior to another.

33:34.762 --> 33:37.640
Please tell me where she is.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.934
- The She-elf already knows.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.813
(head thuds)

33:43.813 --> 33:48.818
(cloak rustles)
(Drustan sighs)

33:48.943 --> 33:51.446
(sword sheathes)

33:51.446 --> 33:54.115
(cloak rustles)

33:57.118 --> 34:00.246
- All right, Sharia Gethyra.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.791
Take me to her then.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.670
- [Sharia] Why the sudden
change of heart, Ranger?

34:08.713 --> 34:11.549
- This man's blood has
verified your words,

34:13.301 --> 34:15.386
and I always trust blood over woods.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.306
Lead the way.

34:21.350 --> 34:24.270
(leaves crunching)

34:24.270 --> 34:27.356
(dark ominous music)

34:38.159 --> 34:43.164
(Caraphinneth chants
in a mystical language)

34:44.998 --> 34:46.918
- Mograh, give your blade.

34:48.335 --> 34:49.545
(dagger unsheathes)

34:49.545 --> 34:50.838
- If I had a gold coin

34:50.838 --> 34:53.341
for every time you stopped
to chant your grog.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.092
- It is not grog, Mograh.

34:55.092 --> 34:58.679
I prepare hideous poison
that stay in body,

34:58.679 --> 34:59.972
even after death.

34:59.972 --> 35:02.642
- [Mograh] And all this
time I thought I was evil.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.894
- [Caraphinneth] Once
poison enters bloodstream,

35:04.894 --> 35:07.939
Vital organs begin to consume each other.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.524
Bones consume flesh,

35:09.524 --> 35:11.275
sinews consume bone,

35:11.275 --> 35:12.777
until there is nothing left

35:12.777 --> 35:15.071
but blackness underneath the skin.

35:15.071 --> 35:16.989
- Oi, give it here, Elf!

35:16.989 --> 35:18.491
Or I'll cut you like a porker!

35:18.491 --> 35:23.496
(Caraphinneth chants
in a mystical language)

35:23.579 --> 35:28.334
- This poison is made from
the blood of 13 black orcs.

35:28.334 --> 35:30.711
The essence of evil contained therein

35:30.711 --> 35:34.048
is more powerful than the
resurrected life force

35:34.048 --> 35:36.717
that flows through your veins.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.928
Don't toy with it, Mograh.

35:38.928 --> 35:41.389
I'm trying to protect you from awful fate.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.058
- Caraphinneth, I'm sorry.

35:44.058 --> 35:45.476
(Mograh gasping)

35:45.476 --> 35:48.062
(breathes heavily)

35:48.062 --> 35:49.939
You wicked witch!

35:49.939 --> 35:53.109
(dark ominous music swells)

35:53.109 --> 35:55.194
- [Drustan] Had I lost my way,

35:55.194 --> 35:59.740
never did I dream not considered
traveling with a She-elf.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.075
To associate with one

36:01.075 --> 36:04.203
is to bring unwelcome
judgment from the kingdom.

36:04.203 --> 36:05.997
Seemed we were desperate allies.

36:06.914 --> 36:10.168
At this point, I held on
to any glimmer of hope

36:10.168 --> 36:11.794
I would find Reina,

36:11.794 --> 36:13.254
even if it meant remaining

36:13.254 --> 36:15.798
in the company of this woodland creature.

36:15.798 --> 36:19.760
Her proud superiority
over humans was unnerving.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.430
As a child, I thought that
wood elves to be a theory,

36:22.430 --> 36:23.890
and without guile.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.725
Years of rangering in the Borderlands

36:25.725 --> 36:27.435
have taught me otherwise.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.520
They're hundreds of years old.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.772
Proud beings, they are,

36:31.772 --> 36:33.316
and rightfully so.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.152
I suppose, after centuries
of living and fighting,

36:36.152 --> 36:38.487
I'd be a proud creature as well.

36:38.487 --> 36:41.699
I would travel with the
She-elf as long as needed,

36:41.699 --> 36:44.619
then we would go our separate ways.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.537
(footsteps pattering)

36:46.537 --> 36:48.206
- Drop your gear, Ranger.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.208
We'll rest here and gather our strength.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.796
- Well, you certainly travel light.

36:55.796 --> 36:57.340
- [Sharia] Well, I don't
require as much as you do

36:57.340 --> 36:59.550
to sustain myself.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.052
(arrows clatter)

37:01.052 --> 37:03.638
- You wood elves have always
been peculiar creatures.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.973
- Well, you humans have always been quick

37:05.973 --> 37:08.768
to wage war on that which
you do not understand.

37:12.521 --> 37:13.814
Do you have a name, Ranger,

37:13.814 --> 37:17.151
or shall I just call you Ranger
for the rest of our journey?

37:19.528 --> 37:20.780
- Why is it of concern?

37:27.078 --> 37:30.414
If you must know, I am Drustan Lorne.

37:31.374 --> 37:33.709
- Quite the name for a
farmer turned ranger.

37:33.709 --> 37:35.253
- You have it wrong, She-elf.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.296
I was not a farmer,

37:39.507 --> 37:42.760
nor was I anything really.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.472
Just lost in the dark shroud

37:46.472 --> 37:48.474
that consumes most things in this world.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.729
- [Sharia] So where
does your journey begin?

37:53.729 --> 37:57.066
(mellow instrumental music)

37:57.066 --> 37:58.526
- [Drustan] Life wasn't always as dark

37:58.526 --> 38:00.152
and grim as I've come to know it.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.780
Before the orc raiding wars

38:03.656 --> 38:06.075
there was peace in the Grimmock Mountains.

38:06.993 --> 38:11.998
The King's vanguard, his
elite warriors, the rangers,

38:12.164 --> 38:15.084
stood immovable and
steadfast in their duty

38:15.084 --> 38:17.420
to protect the Borderlands.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.381
My Indian mother died

38:20.381 --> 38:23.092
by the hand festering
creatures of darkness.

38:23.968 --> 38:27.388
Hence my ever-growing hatred towards them.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.557
My father, the trapper,

38:29.557 --> 38:31.684
often spoke of his ancient ancestors

38:31.684 --> 38:33.769
who were protectors of the realm.

38:33.769 --> 38:37.023
They were legendary in
the art of the hunt.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.942
The old man would go on and on.

38:39.942 --> 38:41.652
Before one day,

38:41.652 --> 38:45.489
a thieving bandit stabbed
him for 13 pieces of silver.

38:46.699 --> 38:50.286
And so I became a child of the village.

38:50.286 --> 38:53.789
In this place was a certain
unspeakable serenity

38:53.789 --> 38:55.958
that permeated the very essence of life.

38:58.836 --> 38:59.920
I knew everyone,

39:01.255 --> 39:04.759
and in turn, everyone knew me.

39:05.968 --> 39:08.012
We all had a similar story to tell.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.432
I considered these fine people my family.

39:12.808 --> 39:14.101
I grew quite fond of them.

39:14.977 --> 39:16.687
We took care of one another.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.690
(indistinct chattering)
- Great times

39:19.690 --> 39:21.525
with a wonderful-
(child groans)

39:21.525 --> 39:23.652
(fruit thuds)
(villager groans)

39:23.652 --> 39:24.987
If that's not bad enough for you,

39:24.987 --> 39:26.530
I'm gonna get you!

39:26.530 --> 39:28.491
(child yells)

39:28.491 --> 39:29.408
(villager groans)

39:29.408 --> 39:31.243
- [Drustan] Deep down in my heart,

39:31.243 --> 39:34.205
I always knew one day

39:34.205 --> 39:38.209
the peaceful life I enjoyed
would be taken away.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.961
Call it a stirring in my dreams.

39:40.961 --> 39:43.672
The voice of destiny was calling to me,

39:43.672 --> 39:47.843
echoing through the
ages, transcending time,

39:47.843 --> 39:50.388
compelling me to heed her call.

39:51.806 --> 39:55.434
Alas, it was time to meet my future.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.937
A village steeped in tradition

39:57.937 --> 39:59.980
held true to a rite of passage,

40:00.815 --> 40:03.526
When one came to the age of independence,

40:03.526 --> 40:06.654
one would see the Lady of the Woods.

40:06.654 --> 40:10.658
And so I gathered every
needful thing for my journey.

40:10.658 --> 40:14.662
I knew not what it truly
meant to survive in the woods.

40:14.662 --> 40:15.663
I was a young man

40:16.539 --> 40:19.125
with a naive notion that
all was well in the world.

40:20.209 --> 40:23.129
Nevertheless, my eyes would soon be opened

40:23.129 --> 40:27.007
to the raw reality that plagued mankind.

40:27.007 --> 40:31.512
(mellow instrumental music continues)

40:33.305 --> 40:36.809
(gentle orchestral music)

40:49.196 --> 40:53.033
(dramatic instrumental music)

41:05.838 --> 41:08.924
(dark ominous music)

41:14.430 --> 41:17.266
(leaves rustling)

41:19.185 --> 41:23.105
(dark ominous music continues)

41:26.692 --> 41:27.526
- Give your hand.

41:29.195 --> 41:32.990
(dark ominous music continues)

41:32.990 --> 41:34.241
- [Drustan] What do you see?

41:34.241 --> 41:35.242
- No, no (shushing).

41:36.368 --> 41:37.661
You no talk.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.163
You listen now.

41:41.123 --> 41:44.376
I see two ways for you.

41:44.376 --> 41:48.047
The first path is quiet, peaceful.

41:49.298 --> 41:51.509
You live long time,

41:51.509 --> 41:54.178
and you alone on this path.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.847
(bowl clanking)

41:58.933 --> 42:02.603
(dark ominous music swells)

42:11.654 --> 42:13.155
(sighs loudly) The second path

42:19.119 --> 42:24.083
is filled with many great
and terrible things.

42:24.083 --> 42:27.336
Lots of death and darkness.

42:29.088 --> 42:33.008
But through that death, come life.

42:34.051 --> 42:38.806
You have much pain and sorrow.

42:38.806 --> 42:42.851
You lose your wife to the
creatures of darkness,

42:42.851 --> 42:47.856
but you love your daughter
more than the world itself.

42:48.399 --> 42:53.362
Soon, you seek out living ancestor

42:53.362 --> 42:55.447
west out here in the mountain.

42:55.447 --> 42:58.617
He is great warrior.

42:58.617 --> 43:00.578
He train you his ways.

43:02.162 --> 43:07.084
You become wise and strong!

43:07.084 --> 43:10.546
You can face anything because of him.

43:10.546 --> 43:12.464
(intense whooshing)

43:12.464 --> 43:16.468
(breathes shakily) I see.

43:17.344 --> 43:20.222
I am in the presence of greatness!

43:22.600 --> 43:23.601
You, Ranger!

43:28.397 --> 43:31.817
You do many great things for many people.

43:33.652 --> 43:36.739
So Drustan, creature of light,

43:39.783 --> 43:43.162
which path you choose?

43:44.371 --> 43:48.208
(dramatic instrumental music)

44:36.840 --> 44:38.592
(apple crunching)

44:38.592 --> 44:43.597
(ominous dramatic music)
(apple thuds)

44:44.765 --> 44:49.019
(ominous dramatic music continues)

44:59.905 --> 45:02.491
(blows loudly)

45:04.702 --> 45:07.538
(apple crunching)

45:08.997 --> 45:10.833
- You and your poison.

45:12.501 --> 45:13.502
Shh, listen.

45:14.461 --> 45:18.257
There's a scared little hare
over there in them bushes.

45:18.257 --> 45:19.425
Do us a favor,

45:19.425 --> 45:20.676
and fetch us some supper.

45:21.760 --> 45:25.180
(ominous dramatic music)

45:26.640 --> 45:28.976
(liquid gurgling)

45:28.976 --> 45:29.977
(sword clanks)

45:29.977 --> 45:33.981
(ominous dramatic music swells)

45:39.903 --> 45:41.488
You pathetic worm.

45:41.488 --> 45:43.741
If not for me, you'd die out here.

45:46.243 --> 45:48.287
(apple crunching)

45:48.287 --> 45:52.124
(dramatic instrumental music)

46:00.883 --> 46:04.386
(footsteps pattering)

46:04.386 --> 46:06.722
(bushes rustling)

46:06.722 --> 46:08.932
(footsteps continue pattering)

46:08.932 --> 46:10.601
- Pardon me, sir.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.228
Can you spare a coin for an old beggar?

46:14.271 --> 46:17.191
- Sorry, old man, I haven't any to spare.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.692
Be on your way now.

46:18.692 --> 46:21.862
- Please, young command,
I only need one coin.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.115
- I really do wish I could help,

46:25.115 --> 46:27.034
but how do I know you won't just drink it

46:27.034 --> 46:29.036
all away with grog?

46:29.036 --> 46:31.872
- Please, sir, I beg of you,

46:31.872 --> 46:34.208
won't you help an old man?

46:34.208 --> 46:36.084
- I'm starting to get frustrated, beggar.

46:36.084 --> 46:37.127
Be on your way now!

46:37.127 --> 46:38.629
I'm searching for my ancestor.

46:39.838 --> 46:42.758
- Oh, my dear boy,

46:42.758 --> 46:47.221
the only one who lives in
these woods is the Ancient One

46:47.221 --> 46:49.348
just over that hill.

46:49.348 --> 46:50.474
- Just over that hill?

46:50.474 --> 46:51.308
- Yes.

46:53.352 --> 46:54.228
- Thanks, old man.

46:55.145 --> 46:58.148
(footsteps departing)

46:58.148 --> 47:01.318
(footsteps pattering)

47:04.947 --> 47:08.367
(ominous dramatic music)

47:10.285 --> 47:13.205
(knocking at door)

47:14.289 --> 47:15.249
Hello, sir.

47:15.249 --> 47:16.667
I am Drustan Lorne.

47:18.210 --> 47:19.127
I'm your kin.

47:20.087 --> 47:22.798
I've come to seek wisdom and guidance.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.758
I've traveled long and far to meet you.

47:27.469 --> 47:28.762
Please come out.

47:28.762 --> 47:30.722
(knocking on door)

47:30.722 --> 47:31.974
Are you there, sir?

47:33.892 --> 47:37.896
(ominous dramatic music swells)

47:43.819 --> 47:45.404
What now, old man?

47:45.404 --> 47:48.574
I told you I didn't
have any coins for you.

47:48.574 --> 47:52.411
(dramatic instrumental music)

48:01.628 --> 48:04.715
(door clatters open)

48:06.466 --> 48:09.344
(door thuds shut)
I had no idea, sir.

48:09.344 --> 48:12.139
Please forgive my rudeness.

48:12.139 --> 48:13.015
I have coin!

48:13.015 --> 48:14.683
I can pay you whatever you want!

48:17.561 --> 48:20.647
I've come all this way, Ancient One.

48:20.647 --> 48:21.982
This is my chosen path.

48:21.982 --> 48:23.275
You must train me!

48:23.275 --> 48:25.527
For without your guidance,
I have no purpose!

48:28.071 --> 48:29.197
I beg of you.

48:29.197 --> 48:32.200
Please, sir, forgive
this misunderstanding.

48:32.200 --> 48:35.412
(door clatters open)

48:35.412 --> 48:37.164
- Apologies, young man,

48:38.040 --> 48:40.834
but I have no time to spare.

48:40.834 --> 48:43.045
I simply cannot train you.

48:44.379 --> 48:45.339
- But I'm your kin!

48:45.339 --> 48:46.715
You're my living ancestor.

48:48.508 --> 48:52.554
- But how do I know you
won't just waste my time

48:52.554 --> 48:54.222
and drink my grog?

48:55.807 --> 48:58.352
- I've come to work hard
and be trained by you.

48:58.352 --> 49:00.687
The Lady of the Woods
said it 'twas my destiny.

49:01.563 --> 49:03.774
- (groans) I'm starting to get

49:03.774 --> 49:05.943
frustrated with you, young command.

49:06.902 --> 49:08.153
Be on your way now.

49:09.488 --> 49:12.282
(door thuds shut)

49:12.282 --> 49:15.202
(insects chirping)

49:23.126 --> 49:24.586
You're still here?

49:28.507 --> 49:31.218
(water sloshing)

49:31.218 --> 49:32.761
- [Drustan] No, please!

49:32.761 --> 49:33.595
Sir!
(door thuds shut)

49:33.595 --> 49:35.430
Do you not care I will freeze out here?

49:38.350 --> 49:43.355
(fire crackling)
(Ancient One humming)

50:03.166 --> 50:07.170
(Drustan exhales loudly)

50:07.170 --> 50:08.755
(Ancient One moans)

50:08.755 --> 50:11.508
(fire crackling)

50:14.511 --> 50:16.972
(Ancient One moans)

50:16.972 --> 50:21.435
(Ancient One hums)
(Drustan sighs)

50:21.435 --> 50:24.021
(Ancient One continues humming)

50:24.021 --> 50:25.188
- I wouldn't.
(liquid sloshing)

50:25.188 --> 50:26.023
(spits loudly)

50:26.023 --> 50:27.482
(Drustan gags)

50:27.482 --> 50:28.942
(fire crackling)

50:28.942 --> 50:32.237
(insects chirping)

50:32.237 --> 50:35.907
(gentle instrumental music)

50:42.205 --> 50:43.749
(Drustan gasps)

50:43.749 --> 50:45.876
(groans loudly)

50:45.876 --> 50:49.713
(continues groaning)

50:49.713 --> 50:51.131
(exhales loudly)

50:51.131 --> 50:55.635
(gentle instrumental music continues)

51:02.059 --> 51:05.937
(animals howl in the distance)

51:08.565 --> 51:13.570
(mystical tones)
(dramatic instrumental music)

51:22.954 --> 51:27.626
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

51:28.794 --> 51:32.798
- So what do you think, grog or coin?

51:32.798 --> 51:35.425
- That's coin.
- Agreeing with.

51:35.425 --> 51:39.471
What do you wager, grog or coin?

51:39.471 --> 51:40.597
- Maybe grog.
- Hmm.

51:43.016 --> 51:44.851
And what do you think?

51:46.436 --> 51:47.979
Grog or coin?

51:50.315 --> 51:51.775
You think about it then.

51:53.985 --> 51:55.278
(blow thuds)
(outlander grunts)

51:55.278 --> 51:57.948
(outlander continues grunting)
(Drustan groans)

51:57.948 --> 51:58.865
(blade clanks)

51:58.865 --> 51:59.699
(blow thuds)

51:59.699 --> 52:00.534
(Drustan groans painfully)

52:00.534 --> 52:02.410
(Drustan coughs)
- Why not just knock him out,

52:02.410 --> 52:03.537
then take the loot?
(continues coughing)

52:03.537 --> 52:04.955
- Where's the fun in that?

52:04.955 --> 52:06.498
(blow thuds)
(Drustan groans)

52:06.498 --> 52:07.499
You'll get your turn.

52:07.499 --> 52:08.667
(blow thuds)
(Drustan groans)

52:08.667 --> 52:09.626
Get in there!

52:09.626 --> 52:11.253
(feet shuffling)
(blow thuds)

52:11.253 --> 52:13.547
(blows continue thudding)
(both groaning)

52:13.547 --> 52:14.381
(fist thuds)

52:14.381 --> 52:15.257
That's the spirit!

52:15.257 --> 52:16.341
(fist continues thudding)

52:16.341 --> 52:20.137
(Boss Bandit laughs)
- Get off.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.555
(Drustan grunts)
(blow thuds)

52:21.555 --> 52:23.807
(blows continue thudding)

52:23.807 --> 52:24.641
(spits loudly)

52:24.641 --> 52:26.143
(Drustan grunts)
(sword clanks)

52:26.143 --> 52:27.686
(blow thuds)

52:27.686 --> 52:28.520
(blows continue thudding)

52:28.520 --> 52:29.354
(door clatters open)

52:29.354 --> 52:31.273
(triumphant instrumental music)

52:31.273 --> 52:34.776
(blows thudding)

52:34.776 --> 52:36.528
(footsteps departing)

52:36.528 --> 52:41.491
(triumphant instrumental music continues)

52:42.159 --> 52:44.035
- I'll get you for this one, man.

52:44.035 --> 52:45.203
Mark my words!

52:49.624 --> 52:52.043
(head thuds)

52:53.545 --> 52:57.215
(gentle instrumental music)

53:03.930 --> 53:05.557
- [Ancient One] Easy.

53:05.557 --> 53:06.391
Relax.

53:09.269 --> 53:11.646
- Are they dead then?

53:11.646 --> 53:13.023
- No more than you.

53:14.941 --> 53:18.987
- How can such disregard
for human life exist?

53:18.987 --> 53:22.199
- Evil has its place in the world.

53:24.159 --> 53:28.997
Where there is light there
must also be darkness.

53:28.997 --> 53:32.959
One cannot exist without the other.

53:32.959 --> 53:34.628
- Are they born of darkness then?

53:36.338 --> 53:40.675
- I believe we are all born with a choice.

53:40.675 --> 53:42.594
We choose our path,

53:42.594 --> 53:47.599
and then fate decides if we
are to be a force for light

53:48.225 --> 53:50.477
or a force for darkness.

53:51.770 --> 53:53.647
- Does this mean you'll train me then?

53:53.647 --> 53:57.317
- What do you think I've
been doing this past week?

53:57.317 --> 53:58.652
- I don't understand.

53:58.652 --> 54:01.071
- When I refused your request to train,

54:02.697 --> 54:06.243
you relentlessly persisted.

54:07.118 --> 54:09.579
You passed the test.

54:09.579 --> 54:14.542
A warrior never gives
up, never surrenders,

54:14.626 --> 54:18.088
and never gives in to the forces

54:18.088 --> 54:20.715
he has the power to overcome.

54:21.591 --> 54:23.677
- That was a test?

54:23.677 --> 54:24.678
- [Ancient One] Aye.

54:26.179 --> 54:28.139
- I starved for a week,

54:28.139 --> 54:30.767
rest on disgusting water,

54:30.767 --> 54:32.018
froze in the night,

54:32.018 --> 54:33.895
was tormented by wolves,

54:33.895 --> 54:37.148
and nearly beaten to death
by a thieving bandit,

54:38.149 --> 54:40.610
and all that was a test?
- Aye.

54:40.610 --> 54:42.279
The first of many.

54:42.279 --> 54:43.446
- You're a sick old man!

54:43.446 --> 54:45.573
- [Ancient One] And what have you learned?

54:46.408 --> 54:48.034
- That I'm related to a sadist!

54:48.034 --> 54:49.244
- You'll thank me later.

54:51.371 --> 54:56.376
(birds chirping)
(arrow clattering)

55:01.381 --> 55:04.426
(bow whooshing)
(arrow thuds)

55:04.426 --> 55:05.468
- What next, old man?

55:07.429 --> 55:12.434
- Don't let a lucky shot
be mistaken for skill.

55:12.726 --> 55:14.519
- It 'twas not luck.

55:14.519 --> 55:16.187
That was my weapon.

55:16.187 --> 55:17.397
It speaks to me.

55:17.397 --> 55:22.402
- Maybe so, but skills
still needs to be acquired.

55:23.570 --> 55:27.574
Now, shoot it again.
(Drustan exhales loudly)

55:27.574 --> 55:30.327
(arrow clatters)

55:33.663 --> 55:34.831
(arrow whooshing)

55:34.831 --> 55:36.916
(Drustan groans loudly)

55:36.916 --> 55:41.671
One day, you shall call upon the elements

55:42.964 --> 55:46.926
to guide you in your quest,

55:46.926 --> 55:49.387
but until that day,

55:49.387 --> 55:51.473
you have much to learn.

55:55.727 --> 55:57.145
(slaps chest)
Again!

55:59.981 --> 56:02.734
(arrow clatters)

56:03.860 --> 56:07.697
(dramatic instrumental music)

56:10.450 --> 56:11.284
(bow whooshing)

56:11.284 --> 56:12.327
(arrow thuds)
(Drustan yells angrily)

56:12.327 --> 56:14.245
Anger.

56:14.245 --> 56:15.288
Yes!

56:16.122 --> 56:18.500
Channel that energy!

56:18.500 --> 56:20.919
Bend your will to it!

56:20.919 --> 56:21.836
Again!

56:23.046 --> 56:25.799
(arrow clatters)

56:27.175 --> 56:29.677
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

56:29.677 --> 56:32.055
(bow creaking)

56:32.055 --> 56:32.889
That's it.

56:33.890 --> 56:36.601
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

56:36.601 --> 56:38.103
Listen to the air.

56:39.020 --> 56:40.647
It's speaking to you.

56:41.981 --> 56:43.274
Do you hear it?

56:45.443 --> 56:46.736
What is it saying?

56:50.156 --> 56:51.032
Wait for it.

56:53.701 --> 56:54.702
Wait for it.

57:00.208 --> 57:01.042
(bow whooshing)

57:01.042 --> 57:03.628
(arrow thuds)

57:06.089 --> 57:07.090
Excellent.

57:08.925 --> 57:12.095
(Ancient One coughs)

57:18.935 --> 57:21.688
- [Drustan] As much as
I hated to admit it,

57:21.688 --> 57:24.065
the Ancient One cracked my hubris.

57:26.401 --> 57:27.735
I knew he was right.

57:29.612 --> 57:31.698
Deep down it was what I wanted,

57:33.491 --> 57:35.994
to be trained by the ancient warrior,

57:36.995 --> 57:39.706
to shake off the shackles of weakness.

57:39.706 --> 57:42.709
(pencil scratching)

57:43.835 --> 57:47.505
(mellow instrumental music)

57:52.010 --> 57:54.888
(leaves crunching)

57:59.934 --> 58:02.395
(bag rustling)

58:02.395 --> 58:04.355
(necklace shuffles)

58:04.355 --> 58:06.941
(bag clatters)

58:13.615 --> 58:16.826
- If you are to be a force for light,

58:18.077 --> 58:20.663
you must yield to it.

58:20.663 --> 58:23.208
(sticks clacking)

58:23.208 --> 58:25.043
Submit to it!

58:25.043 --> 58:28.004
(sticks clacking)

58:28.004 --> 58:28.838
(hand slaps)

58:28.838 --> 58:30.215
Respect it!

58:30.215 --> 58:32.550
(sticks clacking)

58:32.550 --> 58:33.384
(Drustan groans)

58:33.384 --> 58:35.094
Honor its might.

58:35.094 --> 58:38.223
(sticks clacking)

58:38.223 --> 58:41.434
Your determination will punish you.

58:42.727 --> 58:47.023
It will throw you in ways
you never thought possible.

58:50.151 --> 58:52.403
Listen to the air.

58:52.403 --> 58:54.614
The air speaks.

58:54.614 --> 58:58.034
You must train your ears to hear it.

58:59.536 --> 59:02.080
- And so I trained.

59:02.080 --> 59:04.415
Until I started to hear with my ears,

59:05.792 --> 59:08.336
I was convinced I had no problems hearing.

59:09.170 --> 59:11.756
It was not that kind of
hearing I was lacking.

59:13.132 --> 59:15.218
I was proud, and arrogant,

59:16.094 --> 59:18.346
and I let it rule my being.

59:19.389 --> 59:21.724
I would learn to be rid of such weakness

59:21.724 --> 59:24.519
and open my heart to true strength.

59:24.519 --> 59:26.563
It wasn't until much later I would learn

59:26.563 --> 59:28.731
I needed to listen to the earth.

59:29.857 --> 59:31.734
For years to come,

59:31.734 --> 59:33.486
the Ancient One would teach me,

59:33.486 --> 59:36.739
that if I listened to the earth,

59:36.739 --> 59:38.408
she would never betray me.

59:39.909 --> 59:43.037
Eventually, my body learned
to flow with the elements.

59:44.122 --> 59:45.748
I learned how to direct,

59:45.748 --> 59:48.501
then redirect, energy into my opponent.

59:49.711 --> 59:52.797
In time, after weapons were mastered

59:52.797 --> 59:55.174
and training was completed,

59:55.174 --> 59:59.012
one spoke to me as the
Ancient One had promised.

1:00:00.138 --> 1:00:03.766
This weapon would become
an extension of my essence.

1:00:05.226 --> 1:00:07.895
I came to truly rely on its being.

1:00:09.063 --> 1:00:09.939
We hunted.

1:00:11.065 --> 1:00:14.569
We tracked everything that moved.

1:00:14.569 --> 1:00:18.781
Soon, I came to know every
creature that walked this world.

1:00:19.824 --> 1:00:22.952
Everything leaves an imprint in its wake.

1:00:23.786 --> 1:00:25.663
I learned how to recognize it.

1:00:26.789 --> 1:00:30.251
I unlocked the power of my senses.

1:00:30.251 --> 1:00:33.379
They taught me where I needed to be.

1:00:33.379 --> 1:00:36.799
I was ready to become one with
the elements of the warrior.

1:00:37.759 --> 1:00:41.721
My years of hard work had paid off.

1:00:43.222 --> 1:00:44.682
But little did I know,

1:00:45.808 --> 1:00:48.645
my training was not yet over.

1:00:49.687 --> 1:00:50.813
Ancient Father,

1:00:51.856 --> 1:00:53.941
I am ready to be a protector of the realm.

1:00:55.652 --> 1:00:59.072
It's been 4,000 days since
I arrived at your doorstep.

1:01:00.490 --> 1:01:02.575
I've mastered everything you've taught me.

1:01:03.826 --> 1:01:06.954
Please release me into the world,

1:01:08.164 --> 1:01:09.916
and to give me your blessing

1:01:09.916 --> 1:01:12.585
to fight against the forces of darkness.

1:01:17.965 --> 1:01:19.592
- Very well, my son.

1:01:21.219 --> 1:01:24.639
You are ready for your final test.

1:01:24.639 --> 1:01:28.476
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:01:43.449 --> 1:01:45.201
(arrow clatters)

1:01:45.201 --> 1:01:48.371
(footsteps crunching)

1:01:50.498 --> 1:01:55.169
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:01:56.045 --> 1:02:01.050
Become a Watcher of the
Woods of the Ancient Order.

1:02:02.093 --> 1:02:06.013
One can have the power to overcome you

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:10.727
through sheer force of strength.

1:02:12.145 --> 1:02:16.441
You must learn to hear it coming.

1:02:19.068 --> 1:02:20.403
(bow creaks)

1:02:20.403 --> 1:02:25.032
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:02:29.412 --> 1:02:30.872
(arrow whooshing)

1:02:30.872 --> 1:02:35.543
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:02:38.546 --> 1:02:41.215
(pants heavily)

1:02:43.718 --> 1:02:45.678
You are now ready, my son.

1:02:48.806 --> 1:02:53.811
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:02:53.895 --> 1:02:56.981
(Ancient One coughs)

1:03:05.990 --> 1:03:08.659
(bucket clangs)

1:03:09.786 --> 1:03:12.205
(hand thuds)

1:03:13.414 --> 1:03:16.375
(bucket clattering)

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:21.214
(pensive instrumental music)

1:03:21.214 --> 1:03:25.009
(footsteps pattering)

1:03:25.009 --> 1:03:29.597
(pensive instrumental music continues)

1:03:31.432 --> 1:03:34.519
(Ancient One coughs)

1:03:36.145 --> 1:03:39.565
(intense dramatic music)

1:03:41.442 --> 1:03:43.820
- So Greenwood, what's your wager?

1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:45.279
Grog or coin?

1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:48.074
- Coin.

1:03:48.074 --> 1:03:48.991
- Kreiger would have bet grog.

1:03:48.991 --> 1:03:51.369
He's in the forest collectin' poison.

1:03:51.369 --> 1:03:52.328
Kind of a shame.

1:03:52.328 --> 1:03:54.121
He would have loved to see this.

1:03:54.121 --> 1:03:57.708
- You boys best be moving along now.

1:03:57.708 --> 1:03:59.126
- We've only come for
your possessions, old man.

1:03:59.126 --> 1:04:02.129
It's not like we're gonna toy with ya,

1:04:03.089 --> 1:04:05.800
and then cut your lights just for sport.

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:08.302
- I'm warning you thieves!

1:04:08.302 --> 1:04:10.179
- That's rather rude.

1:04:10.179 --> 1:04:11.305
Isn't it, boys?
(Ancient One sighs)

1:04:11.305 --> 1:04:14.267
- Boss, let's just take his loot and go.

1:04:15.142 --> 1:04:17.562
- Greenwood, have you not learned by now

1:04:17.562 --> 1:04:20.231
I have no interest in this man's loot?

1:04:20.231 --> 1:04:23.401
(footsteps pattering)

1:04:24.902 --> 1:04:29.907
I want you
(sword unsheathes)

1:04:30.074 --> 1:04:33.202
to kill the Ancient One.

1:04:33.202 --> 1:04:37.456
(intense dramatic music continues)

1:04:40.334 --> 1:04:42.295
- Boss, I ain't sure about this?

1:04:44.505 --> 1:04:46.299
- You ain't sure about this?

1:04:47.258 --> 1:04:51.512
(intense dramatic music continues)

1:04:52.972 --> 1:04:57.184
Why should we let some
wood rat scum like him

1:04:57.184 --> 1:04:58.519
live in our forest?

1:04:58.519 --> 1:05:00.396
Because he's a protector of the realm?

1:05:01.355 --> 1:05:04.775
(bucket clatters)
(footsteps pattering)

1:05:04.775 --> 1:05:06.569
Where was the Ancient One

1:05:06.569 --> 1:05:07.862
when my family needed him,

1:05:09.071 --> 1:05:12.408
when I needed him?

1:05:14.577 --> 1:05:16.203
Off fightin' in some war!

1:05:16.203 --> 1:05:18.539
And then the elves came and killed them

1:05:18.539 --> 1:05:21.876
all in the name of honor and light!

1:05:21.876 --> 1:05:24.754
(footsteps pattering)

1:05:24.754 --> 1:05:26.172
(blow thuds)
(Boss Bandit groans)

1:05:26.172 --> 1:05:27.423
Now, brother!

1:05:27.423 --> 1:05:28.633
Do it!

1:05:28.633 --> 1:05:30.301
(Ancient One coughs)
I'll just do it!

1:05:30.301 --> 1:05:31.135
(Boss Bandit groans)
(sword clanks)

1:05:31.135 --> 1:05:34.555
(Ancient One screams)

1:05:34.555 --> 1:05:36.140
(sword clanks)

1:05:36.140 --> 1:05:38.893
(grass rustling)

1:05:40.436 --> 1:05:41.938
Run.

1:05:41.938 --> 1:05:44.065
(footsteps pattering)

1:05:44.065 --> 1:05:45.816
(footsteps clomping)

1:05:45.816 --> 1:05:47.276
(Boss Bandit pants heavily)

1:05:47.276 --> 1:05:51.113
- No, no (wincing painfully).

1:05:51.113 --> 1:05:53.991
(footsteps pattering)

1:05:53.991 --> 1:05:56.702
(feet shuffling)
(Ancient One groans)

1:05:56.702 --> 1:05:57.870
- Sit down.

1:05:57.870 --> 1:05:59.246
Come on, come on.

1:05:59.246 --> 1:06:00.539
(Ancient One grunts)
Come on.

1:06:00.539 --> 1:06:02.333
(both thudding)

1:06:02.333 --> 1:06:06.170
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:06:06.170 --> 1:06:07.463
I'll track them.

1:06:09.006 --> 1:06:10.007
I shall return soon.

1:06:11.550 --> 1:06:15.096
- No, no, don't not pursue them.

1:06:17.264 --> 1:06:19.850
- [Drustan] They are nearly in my sight!

1:06:19.850 --> 1:06:21.560
Why not pursue them?

1:06:22.478 --> 1:06:26.899
- Swear an oath to me that
you will not pursue them.

1:06:29.902 --> 1:06:33.656
- [Drustan] Ancient Father,
you do not know what you ask.

1:06:36.742 --> 1:06:39.245
I feel rage and vengeance,

1:06:40.496 --> 1:06:42.123
an all consuming hate

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:47.086
that must be extinguished
with their blood.

1:06:48.295 --> 1:06:52.049
- It is that very thing
that will defeat you.

1:06:54.635 --> 1:06:56.095
(Ancient One breathes heavily)

1:06:56.095 --> 1:07:01.100
Hate and vengeance is never
extinguished with blood,

1:07:06.272 --> 1:07:11.277
but only grows more
powerful and destructive.

1:07:17.074 --> 1:07:22.079
Now, swear an oath on this
day (breathes shakily)

1:07:25.958 --> 1:07:30.046
on my life that you will
not pursue my attackers.

1:07:35.342 --> 1:07:39.722
(continues breathing shakily)

1:07:39.722 --> 1:07:40.723
- [Drustan] I swear.

1:07:42.808 --> 1:07:45.770
(exhales loudly)

1:07:45.770 --> 1:07:48.522
- You're a great warrior, my son.

1:07:49.857 --> 1:07:53.611
(pensive instrumental music)

1:08:44.245 --> 1:08:47.414
(footsteps pattering)

1:08:50.334 --> 1:08:52.210
(suspenseful dramatic music)

1:08:52.210 --> 1:08:55.380
(footsteps pattering)

1:09:05.307 --> 1:09:08.184
- I can smell your fear, human.

1:09:08.184 --> 1:09:10.312
Come out and play.

1:09:10.312 --> 1:09:11.897
There's no need to be shy.

1:09:13.107 --> 1:09:15.234
(fingers tapping)
(intense dramatic music)

1:09:15.234 --> 1:09:16.318
(dagger unsheathes)

1:09:16.318 --> 1:09:20.573
(intense dramatic music continues)

1:09:22.950 --> 1:09:24.535
- No, no, you stay.

1:09:25.995 --> 1:09:27.871
Mograh has game for you.

1:09:27.871 --> 1:09:29.331
(Mograh groans)

1:09:29.331 --> 1:09:33.460
- Well, well, if it
isn't a peasant survivor

1:09:33.460 --> 1:09:35.379
from a town I pillaged.

1:09:36.380 --> 1:09:37.715
Wait a minute!

1:09:37.715 --> 1:09:39.884
I recognize your face.

1:09:39.884 --> 1:09:42.136
You're the Map Maker.

1:09:42.136 --> 1:09:43.762
- What do you want?

1:09:43.762 --> 1:09:46.932
- (laughs) Caraphinneth,
"What do I want?",

1:09:46.932 --> 1:09:48.434
the Map Maker asks.

1:09:48.434 --> 1:09:50.144
- I'll give you whatever
you want, creature.

1:09:50.144 --> 1:09:52.188
Just let me go.

1:09:52.188 --> 1:09:55.398
- Oi, Caraphinneth, he called me creature,

1:09:55.398 --> 1:09:57.568
and I thought we were playin' nice.

1:09:57.568 --> 1:09:59.945
Tell me where I can find the Bloodstone,

1:09:59.945 --> 1:10:02.323
and Caraphinneth here won't cause you

1:10:02.323 --> 1:10:04.575
a tortured, agonizing death.

1:10:04.575 --> 1:10:06.994
- The only stone I've ever seen

1:10:06.994 --> 1:10:10.664
is hung around the neck
of the Lady of the Woods.

1:10:10.664 --> 1:10:12.082
- The Lady of the Woods you say?

1:10:12.082 --> 1:10:14.126
Why don't you paint me a map?

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:18.339
Do I have anything in my teeth?

1:10:18.339 --> 1:10:19.548
An orc's gotta look his best

1:10:19.548 --> 1:10:21.884
when he's meetin' the Lady of the Woods.

1:10:24.094 --> 1:10:24.929
- Here.

1:10:24.929 --> 1:10:26.472
This will lead you right to her.

1:10:27.431 --> 1:10:29.058
Am I free to go now?

1:10:29.058 --> 1:10:29.892
- Why not?

1:10:29.892 --> 1:10:31.227
I'm an Orc of me words,

1:10:31.227 --> 1:10:34.605
and I did say, "Caraphinneth
wouldn't cause you

1:10:34.605 --> 1:10:37.273
a tortured, agonizing death".

1:10:38.651 --> 1:10:40.986
It's a shame I didn't
include me self in there.

1:10:40.986 --> 1:10:42.446
I wasn't startin' to like ya.

1:10:42.446 --> 1:10:45.866
(ominous dramatic music)

1:10:46.951 --> 1:10:51.496
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:10:51.496 --> 1:10:54.166
(Reina coughs)

1:10:56.502 --> 1:10:58.462
- Come here, little one.

1:10:58.462 --> 1:11:03.133
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:11:28.867 --> 1:11:31.537
There, all better now.

1:11:31.537 --> 1:11:36.541
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:11:36.750 --> 1:11:40.337
(intense dramatic music)

1:11:40.337 --> 1:11:41.130
Shh.

1:11:42.589 --> 1:11:43.424
Hide.

1:11:46.050 --> 1:11:47.761
(clothing thuds)

1:11:47.761 --> 1:11:50.306
- [Henrik] The girl eats
when she finishes the job.

1:11:51.389 --> 1:11:54.184
You eat when she finishes the job.

1:11:54.184 --> 1:11:55.269
- You coward.

1:11:55.269 --> 1:11:57.730
(intense dramatic music continues)

1:11:57.730 --> 1:12:01.567
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:12:06.905 --> 1:12:08.157
- [Sharia] Hmm.

1:12:09.325 --> 1:12:12.119
Drustan, you've dropped this.

1:12:12.119 --> 1:12:15.831
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:12:15.831 --> 1:12:17.791
What memories invade your mind?

1:12:19.043 --> 1:12:20.335
- Yes, Master.

1:12:20.335 --> 1:12:22.004
Find the Bloodstone I will.

1:12:22.004 --> 1:12:24.630
Search every village in
the Grimmock Mountain.

1:12:24.630 --> 1:12:26.258
Oi, I'm no moppet.

1:12:27.468 --> 1:12:31.638
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:12:31.638 --> 1:12:32.889
(intense whooshing)

1:12:32.889 --> 1:12:36.101
- The Bloodstone, what is this artifact?

1:12:36.101 --> 1:12:38.978
- How do you know about this?

1:12:38.978 --> 1:12:39.938
(bow clangs)

1:12:39.938 --> 1:12:43.317
- The orcs who slew my family
and took my daughter captive

1:12:43.317 --> 1:12:44.401
were searching for it.

1:12:45.486 --> 1:12:46.779
They seem to think that I,

1:12:46.779 --> 1:12:49.281
or someone from my village,
was in possession of it.

1:12:49.281 --> 1:12:51.450
- Try to understand, Ranger.

1:12:51.450 --> 1:12:54.912
The Bloodstone is much older
and larger than any of us.

1:12:54.912 --> 1:12:57.581
Forged by the hand of
King De'grun himself.

1:12:57.581 --> 1:13:00.291
Imbued with power that can
rip the rights of creation

1:13:00.291 --> 1:13:02.044
from the gods.
- And what of it?

1:13:02.044 --> 1:13:03.754
- The stone is no longer whole.

1:13:03.754 --> 1:13:06.090
Only fragments exist now.

1:13:06.090 --> 1:13:09.050
Each one contains the
power of an ancient right

1:13:09.050 --> 1:13:11.261
designed to bring back the Shadow King.

1:13:11.261 --> 1:13:12.179
- King De'grun?

1:13:12.179 --> 1:13:13.847
- [Sharia] Precisely.

1:13:13.847 --> 1:13:17.267
- So who is this master
that wants the Bloodstone?

1:13:17.267 --> 1:13:20.853
- Hmm, the son of the king, Prince Korlan.

1:13:20.853 --> 1:13:22.147
(intense whooshing)
Long had the shards

1:13:22.147 --> 1:13:24.775
of the Bloodstone been hidden
in the land of Adrasil,

1:13:25.859 --> 1:13:27.443
long has the Shadow Prince sent out

1:13:27.443 --> 1:13:29.029
his couriers to seek them.

1:13:29.947 --> 1:13:34.451
On a dreadful day, not too
long ago, one was found,

1:13:34.451 --> 1:13:38.789
which led them to the location
of the Etcher of Souls,

1:13:38.789 --> 1:13:40.374
the blade of his father.

1:13:41.375 --> 1:13:42.459
Blood ruins on the blade

1:13:42.459 --> 1:13:44.920
contained King De'grun's soul print.

1:13:46.213 --> 1:13:48.841
It is believed that another
shard of the Bloodstone

1:13:48.841 --> 1:13:50.675
is in the Grimmock Mountains,

1:13:50.675 --> 1:13:52.261
which contains the chanting rights

1:13:52.261 --> 1:13:54.388
used to resurrect the Shadow King.

1:13:54.388 --> 1:13:58.225
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:14:01.895 --> 1:14:05.315
- Mograh, Lady of Woods
is powerful caster,

1:14:05.315 --> 1:14:07.025
much more than I.

1:14:07.025 --> 1:14:08.902
You must go alone.

1:14:08.902 --> 1:14:09.987
I wait here.

1:14:10.862 --> 1:14:12.698
- You mean to tell me,

1:14:12.698 --> 1:14:17.327
I gots to go get that cursed
Bloodstone all by me self?

1:14:17.327 --> 1:14:18.327
Lazy moppet!

1:14:19.371 --> 1:14:22.749
- I stay here and resurrect
you if she kill you.

1:14:22.749 --> 1:14:24.501
You understand.

1:14:24.501 --> 1:14:27.087
Go now, get Bloodstone,

1:14:27.087 --> 1:14:29.298
and bring it back to Master.

1:14:29.298 --> 1:14:31.341
He will give you war band.

1:14:31.341 --> 1:14:35.888
- Oh, you sure know how to
make an orc feel needed.

1:14:35.888 --> 1:14:39.725
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:14:40.809 --> 1:14:43.395
- [Lady Of The Woods] All these years,

1:14:43.395 --> 1:14:45.981
and the answer is finally here.

1:14:47.232 --> 1:14:50.360
- Well, looky what we got here.

1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:51.945
You must be the Lady of the Woods?

1:14:51.945 --> 1:14:53.780
I hear you can see the future.

1:14:53.780 --> 1:14:54.615
Wait a tick!

1:14:54.615 --> 1:14:56.032
Does that mean you knew I'd be here?

1:14:56.032 --> 1:14:58.368
- Yes, Mograh the Merciless,

1:14:59.495 --> 1:15:01.371
I know who you are.

1:15:01.371 --> 1:15:02.748
- So why am I so smart then?

1:15:02.748 --> 1:15:06.585
Every other orc I meet is always
missing part of his brain.

1:15:06.585 --> 1:15:07.585
Why is that?

1:15:07.585 --> 1:15:09.463
- You know the answer.

1:15:09.463 --> 1:15:11.465
- I have been brought back many times.

1:15:11.465 --> 1:15:14.593
And to think, I have all
me memories of lives past.

1:15:14.593 --> 1:15:16.261
That makes me a genius then?

1:15:16.261 --> 1:15:19.056
- I know you come for
the Bloodstone, Mograh.

1:15:19.056 --> 1:15:20.474
- Straight to the point then.

1:15:20.474 --> 1:15:21.391
Give it to me,

1:15:21.391 --> 1:15:24.394
or I'll burn this entire place down!

1:15:26.313 --> 1:15:27.940
- [Lady Of The Woods] There's no need

1:15:27.940 --> 1:15:29.691
to make threat, Mograh.

1:15:30.901 --> 1:15:31.860
I show where it is.

1:15:32.986 --> 1:15:34.737
But first, your fate.

1:15:37.616 --> 1:15:42.621
(dark ominous music)
- Well, ain't I special?

1:15:44.623 --> 1:15:47.416
(bowl clanking)

1:15:47.416 --> 1:15:51.338
(dark ominous music continues)

1:16:09.273 --> 1:16:10.857
- I see two paths for you.

1:16:10.857 --> 1:16:15.862
The first path is quiet, peaceful.

1:16:16.405 --> 1:16:18.824
You live long time,

1:16:18.824 --> 1:16:21.493
and you alone on this path,

1:16:21.493 --> 1:16:26.498
you will die a painless
way where nobody sees.

1:16:27.374 --> 1:16:31.003
Never to return to this world.

1:16:31.003 --> 1:16:35.507
One more life, then it is over.

1:16:36.550 --> 1:16:38.635
- What kinda caster are you?

1:16:38.635 --> 1:16:41.722
- The second path, Mograh,

1:16:41.722 --> 1:16:46.309
require you to take my life.

1:16:47.269 --> 1:16:49.313
And by so doing,

1:16:49.313 --> 1:16:54.192
the power to resurrect yourself
will be granted unto you.

1:16:54.192 --> 1:16:57.696
You will no longer need the necromancer

1:16:57.696 --> 1:17:00.115
to raise you from the dead.

1:17:00.115 --> 1:17:04.661
You will never taste of death.

1:17:04.661 --> 1:17:08.749
- Clever, it's like an upgrade.

1:17:08.749 --> 1:17:10.500
- Spill my blood,

1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:13.712
and this path will lead you to a ranger.

1:17:13.712 --> 1:17:16.298
He is searching for the Outlanders,

1:17:17.341 --> 1:17:18.634
because of you!

1:17:18.634 --> 1:17:20.927
You sold his daughter to them.

1:17:20.927 --> 1:17:21.762
- That's right.

1:17:21.762 --> 1:17:23.930
Say, green skins ain't so good

1:17:23.930 --> 1:17:26.183
at keeping little children alive.

1:17:26.183 --> 1:17:28.769
It's just to tempting to
eat them for breakfast.

1:17:28.769 --> 1:17:31.355
Good thing them Outlanders
is worthless bogs

1:17:31.355 --> 1:17:33.982
who'd rather get little
slaves to cook their supper

1:17:33.982 --> 1:17:35.567
than do it themselves.

1:17:35.567 --> 1:17:39.154
If only they knew the Master
will make them all his slaves

1:17:40.112 --> 1:17:41.782
when the time's right.

1:17:41.782 --> 1:17:44.868
- Go west of here, back
to the Short Hills,

1:17:44.868 --> 1:17:46.161
find the ranger,

1:17:47.537 --> 1:17:50.165
find the shard of the Bloodstone.

1:17:50.165 --> 1:17:54.127
But remember, since you will live forever,

1:17:54.127 --> 1:17:57.339
you shall be sentenced to exist

1:17:57.339 --> 1:18:01.885
in a never ending cycle of torture!

1:18:01.885 --> 1:18:03.887
- Never dying is torture then?

1:18:03.887 --> 1:18:05.722
Let me think!

1:18:05.722 --> 1:18:07.599
So it's either I live a peaceful life

1:18:07.599 --> 1:18:09.976
and die a painless death,

1:18:09.976 --> 1:18:14.981
or I kill you and live forever?

1:18:14.981 --> 1:18:17.109
- That is right.

1:18:17.109 --> 1:18:19.486
So Mograh the Merciless,

1:18:20.987 --> 1:18:22.781
creature of darkness,

1:18:23.657 --> 1:18:25.450
which path you choose?

1:18:26.952 --> 1:18:30.621
(dark ominous music swells)

1:18:38.922 --> 1:18:40.966
(insects chirping)
(air whooshing)

1:18:40.966 --> 1:18:44.094
- What's your name, young one?

1:18:44.094 --> 1:18:45.594
- [Reina] Reina.

1:18:45.594 --> 1:18:47.347
- Where are you from?

1:18:50.225 --> 1:18:53.186
Are you from the Grimmock Mountains?

1:18:54.603 --> 1:18:56.273
In the Borderlands?

1:18:56.273 --> 1:18:58.191
- By the Coldfell River

1:19:01.361 --> 1:19:03.321
(Reina wincing painfully)

1:19:03.321 --> 1:19:04.156
- May I?

1:19:06.907 --> 1:19:11.163
(thunder rumbling in the distance)

1:19:16.376 --> 1:19:18.879
Do you know who I am, Reina?

1:19:18.879 --> 1:19:20.005
- You're an Outlander.

1:19:22.883 --> 1:19:25.010
- How do you know about Outlanders?

1:19:25.010 --> 1:19:26.803
- Daddy told me.

1:19:26.803 --> 1:19:28.221
- Who's your daddy, Reina?

1:19:31.933 --> 1:19:33.434
Does he know where you are?

1:19:33.434 --> 1:19:35.645
- Daddy will find me,
he can find anything.

1:19:35.645 --> 1:19:37.105
He's a ranger.

1:19:37.105 --> 1:19:40.776
(gentle instrumental music)

1:19:49.117 --> 1:19:51.452
(hay rustles)

1:19:51.452 --> 1:19:55.957
(gentle instrumental music continues)

1:19:58.668 --> 1:19:59.710
- [Bjorn] You hungry?

1:19:59.710 --> 1:20:04.216
(gentle instrumental music continues)

1:20:10.263 --> 1:20:13.099
(apple crunching)

1:20:14.017 --> 1:20:15.434
Here, it's yours.

1:20:20.232 --> 1:20:24.693
(gentle instrumental music continues)

1:20:29.866 --> 1:20:32.369
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:20:32.369 --> 1:20:34.329
- [Sharia] Drustan, we're nearly there.

1:20:36.915 --> 1:20:39.835
- Why is it that I could
not find this place before?

1:20:39.835 --> 1:20:41.335
I took note of our travels.

1:20:41.335 --> 1:20:44.089
Your tracking was nothing
out of the ordinary.

1:20:44.089 --> 1:20:45.215
How do you explain this?

1:20:45.215 --> 1:20:48.260
- There's a dark shroud
cast around this forest.

1:20:48.260 --> 1:20:49.761
- [Drustan] I suspected as much.

1:20:49.761 --> 1:20:51.555
- The Master had his casters working hard

1:20:51.555 --> 1:20:53.181
to hide this place from the world.

1:20:53.181 --> 1:20:54.599
- You've been here before,

1:20:54.599 --> 1:20:56.309
but for what purpose, Sharia?

1:20:56.309 --> 1:20:58.436
- I told you, to fight the Outlanders.

1:20:58.436 --> 1:20:59.271
- Not good enough!

1:20:59.271 --> 1:21:00.105
I need more!

1:21:00.105 --> 1:21:02.273
How can you possibly know where this is?

1:21:02.273 --> 1:21:03.984
- Drustan, let it go!

1:21:03.984 --> 1:21:05.110
Let's move on.
- No!

1:21:05.110 --> 1:21:06.152
I've searched too long

1:21:06.152 --> 1:21:09.030
and hard to let any stone go unturned.

1:21:09.030 --> 1:21:11.324
Does it not stand to reason, Sharia,

1:21:11.324 --> 1:21:13.285
who are you really?

1:21:13.285 --> 1:21:14.286
Why did you bring me here?

1:21:14.286 --> 1:21:15.620
- I told you,

1:21:15.620 --> 1:21:17.330
to fight the Outlanders,

1:21:17.330 --> 1:21:19.082
and save your daughter.

1:21:19.082 --> 1:21:19.916
Nothing more.
- How did you know

1:21:19.916 --> 1:21:21.001
about the dark shroud?

1:21:21.001 --> 1:21:23.253
And more importantly, how did
you know how to get past it?

1:21:23.253 --> 1:21:25.922
- Drustan, you're looking into
something that isn't there!

1:21:25.922 --> 1:21:27.257
Let it go!

1:21:27.257 --> 1:21:28.341
Let's move on.

1:21:28.341 --> 1:21:30.385
- Your hiding something,

1:21:30.385 --> 1:21:32.304
and I want no part of your game.

1:21:33.263 --> 1:21:34.848
(bushes rustling)

1:21:34.848 --> 1:21:35.932
Someone's approaching.

1:21:35.932 --> 1:21:36.808
Hide.

1:21:36.808 --> 1:21:39.477
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:21:39.477 --> 1:21:42.647
(footsteps pattering)

1:21:46.151 --> 1:21:47.652
- [Caraphinneth] Wait, Mograh.

1:21:48.778 --> 1:21:50.071
I smell human.

1:21:51.114 --> 1:21:52.365
- That's funny, I smell elf.

1:21:54.492 --> 1:21:57.120
- I'm serious, watch yourself.

1:21:57.120 --> 1:21:58.788
- What are you so worried about?

1:21:58.788 --> 1:22:00.916
I can resurrect myself.

1:22:00.916 --> 1:22:02.459
I killed the Lady of the Woods.

1:22:02.459 --> 1:22:04.753
Where is this Outlander?

1:22:04.753 --> 1:22:07.255
- [Caraphinneth] Patience,
Mograh, he comes now.

1:22:12.427 --> 1:22:14.471
(leaves rustling)
(Mograh growls)

1:22:14.471 --> 1:22:16.889
- You don't scare me, green skin,

1:22:16.889 --> 1:22:19.100
or shall I say pale skin?

1:22:20.018 --> 1:22:24.189
You know, for an orc,
you're quite colorless.

1:22:24.189 --> 1:22:26.066
Has anyone ever told you that?

1:22:26.066 --> 1:22:27.359
- Where is the girl pastie?
- What girl?

1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:29.778
- [Mograh] The one I sold you

1:22:29.778 --> 1:22:32.112
right before I died.
- (scoffs) That's a good one,

1:22:32.112 --> 1:22:34.532
an orc who re-animates himself,

1:22:34.532 --> 1:22:37.285
and tries to claim what
is rightfully mine.

1:22:37.285 --> 1:22:40.038
I wish I had a necromancer by my side.

1:22:40.038 --> 1:22:41.665
Do you charge for this service?

1:22:41.665 --> 1:22:43.124
(dagger unsheathes)

1:22:43.124 --> 1:22:44.166
- Bring me to the girl!

1:22:44.166 --> 1:22:46.544
- [Henrik] Why is she so important to you?

1:22:46.544 --> 1:22:50.090
She's just a worthless peasant
who can't even sew trousers.

1:22:50.090 --> 1:22:52.842
- You stupid git, she's
the daughter of a ranger.

1:22:52.842 --> 1:22:55.804
- [Henrik] This ranger
could never find her.

1:22:55.804 --> 1:22:57.722
The dark shroud protects her.

1:22:57.722 --> 1:23:00.225
- [Caraphinneth] You
underestimate this ranger.

1:23:00.225 --> 1:23:02.227
He travels with She-elf.

1:23:02.227 --> 1:23:04.646
She leads him to your camp.

1:23:04.646 --> 1:23:05.480
- Sharia.

1:23:07.816 --> 1:23:09.234
How do you know?

1:23:09.234 --> 1:23:10.902
- [Caraphinneth] I smell them.

1:23:10.902 --> 1:23:12.195
They're close.

1:23:12.195 --> 1:23:13.822
We don't have much time.

1:23:15.073 --> 1:23:16.532
- I'll bring you to the girl,

1:23:17.450 --> 1:23:19.202
but you pay double your selling price!

1:23:19.202 --> 1:23:21.871
- Greedy, predictable, pastie Outlander,

1:23:21.871 --> 1:23:24.040
this is why we'll be friends forever.

1:23:26.543 --> 1:23:30.338
- [Caraphinneth] Now,
Henrik, bring us to her.

1:23:30.338 --> 1:23:35.343
Do this, and I resurrect
you next time you die.

1:23:38.888 --> 1:23:39.848
- Follow me.

1:23:44.144 --> 1:23:45.353
- Drustan, wait.

1:23:46.896 --> 1:23:49.816
- I have no need for your
assistance anymore, She-elf.

1:23:49.816 --> 1:23:52.068
They will leave me back to their camp.

1:23:52.068 --> 1:23:53.611
I appreciate you taking me this far,

1:23:53.611 --> 1:23:56.448
but this is where we go our separate ways.

1:23:56.448 --> 1:23:57.532
- Stupid human.

1:23:57.532 --> 1:24:00.702
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

1:24:00.702 --> 1:24:01.952
- Then tell me.

1:24:01.952 --> 1:24:03.496
Perhaps I shall sway my mind.

1:24:08.001 --> 1:24:09.544
So be it.

1:24:09.544 --> 1:24:11.546
(arrows clattering)

1:24:11.546 --> 1:24:13.214
(ominous dramatic music)

1:24:13.214 --> 1:24:16.384
(footsteps pattering)

1:24:24.142 --> 1:24:28.396
(ominous dramatic music continues)

1:24:31.066 --> 1:24:33.985
(footsteps clomping)

1:24:33.985 --> 1:24:34.818
(sword swooshing)

1:24:34.818 --> 1:24:36.654
(Outlander groans)
(blow thuds)

1:24:36.654 --> 1:24:37.572
(arrows clatter)

1:24:37.572 --> 1:24:38.698
(Outlander grunts)

1:24:38.698 --> 1:24:40.657
(arrow whooshing)

1:24:40.657 --> 1:24:41.493
(Outlander grunts)

1:24:41.493 --> 1:24:45.746
(ominous dramatic music continues)

1:24:47.540 --> 1:24:48.374
(arrows clatter)

1:24:48.374 --> 1:24:49.209
(bow creaks)

1:24:49.209 --> 1:24:51.878
(footsteps pattering)
(arrow whooshing)

1:24:51.878 --> 1:24:53.671
(sword clanks)
(Outlander groans)

1:24:53.671 --> 1:24:55.799
(arrows clatter)

1:24:55.799 --> 1:24:56.633
(bow clanks)

1:24:56.633 --> 1:24:58.550
(arrow whooshing)

1:24:58.550 --> 1:25:01.846
(arrow clatters)

1:25:01.846 --> 1:25:03.723
(Outlander grunts)

1:25:03.723 --> 1:25:04.641
(blades clanking)
(Outlander groans)

1:25:04.641 --> 1:25:07.519
(body thuds)

1:25:07.519 --> 1:25:10.522
(bow creaks)

1:25:10.522 --> 1:25:12.565
(arrow whooshing)

1:25:12.565 --> 1:25:16.486
(dark ominous music continues)

1:25:18.446 --> 1:25:20.448
(footsteps pattering)

1:25:20.448 --> 1:25:22.700
(door creaks open)

1:25:22.700 --> 1:25:26.538
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:25:29.499 --> 1:25:32.669
(footsteps pattering)

1:25:35.964 --> 1:25:37.799
(bow creaks)

1:25:37.799 --> 1:25:40.260
- You dare wage war on your kin, Sharia?

1:25:40.260 --> 1:25:42.512
- You are not my kin, Outlander.

1:25:42.512 --> 1:25:45.514
You betray all that you once were.

1:25:45.514 --> 1:25:50.186

1:27:17.815 --> 1:27:18.650
(sword unsheathes)

1:27:18.650 --> 1:27:20.485

1:27:56.020 --> 1:27:56.853
(Drustan continues groaning)

1:27:56.853 --> 1:27:58.564
- The mighty elven warrior.

1:27:59.648 --> 1:28:00.984
What's the matter, Sharia?

1:28:02.318 --> 1:28:04.612
You're nothing without your blades.

1:28:04.612 --> 1:28:06.114
Here.

1:28:06.114 --> 1:28:08.199
(dagger whooshing)

1:28:08.199 --> 1:28:09.784
Have this one.

(Sharia groans)
Are you mad, She-elf?

1:28:45.820 --> 1:28:46.946
- [Sharia] He's my husband!

1:28:46.946 --> 1:28:50.407
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:28:50.407 --> 1:28:51.242

(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:29:05.465 --> 1:29:06.841

1:29:06.841 --> 1:29:11.429
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:29:11.429 --> 1:29:12.347
I understand.

1:29:38.331 --> 1:29:41.501
(footsteps pattering)

1:29:49.050 --> 1:29:50.300
- Not so fast!

1:29:50.300 --> 1:29:52.678
I've waited a long time for this.

1:29:53.930 --> 1:29:57.517
Now, pastie ranger,
give me your Bloodstone,

1:29:57.517 --> 1:30:02.313
or witness me cut her
little pretty head off.

1:30:02.313 --> 1:30:05.858
- I don't have the Bloodstone.

1:30:05.858 --> 1:30:08.528
You and your kind have raided

1:30:08.528 --> 1:30:12.573
and killed all that were in
my village searching for it.

1:30:14.032 --> 1:30:15.993
No one has it, Mograh.

1:30:15.993 --> 1:30:19.121
- And I beg to differ, Ranger.

1:30:19.121 --> 1:30:20.581
The Lady of the Woods said

1:30:20.581 --> 1:30:24.502
right before I cut her
lights, you'd have it.

1:30:24.502 --> 1:30:27.130
And if I found you, I'd get it.

1:30:27.130 --> 1:30:28.840
I'd live forever.

1:30:28.840 --> 1:30:31.467
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:30:31.467 --> 1:30:33.010

(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:31:03.791 --> 1:31:04.834
(intense whooshing)
The thing about

1:31:04.834 --> 1:31:08.254
the Lady of the Woods is, she never lies.

1:31:09.297 --> 1:31:12.717
(intense dramatic music)

1:31:17.180 --> 1:31:19.223
(stuffed animal rustles)

1:31:48.669 --> 1:31:52.924
(intense dramatic music continues)

1:32:02.308 --> 1:32:04.727
Oi, Caraphinneth, finish him.

1:32:08.606 --> 1:32:09.440
(Caraphinneth grunts)

1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:11.776

(whimpers softly)

1:32:24.080 --> 1:32:27.416
(Mograh thuds)

1:32:27.416 --> 1:32:30.962
(skin squelching)

(Caraphinneth groans)

1:32:32.838 --> 1:32:34.048
(body thuds)

1:32:34.048 --> 1:32:36.717
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:32:36.717 --> 1:32:37.885
(sword clanks)

1:32:37.885 --> 1:32:38.886
(leaves rustling)

1:32:38.886 --> 1:32:42.139
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:32:42.139 --> 1:32:43.182
(Henrik pants heavily)

1:32:43.182 --> 1:32:44.225
(bow creaks)

1:32:44.225 --> 1:32:46.727
(arrow whooshing)
(Henrik groans)

1:32:46.727 --> 1:32:48.187
(arrow whooshing)

1:32:48.187 --> 1:32:51.857
(Henrik continues groaning)

1:32:53.859 --> 1:32:54.693
(bow creaks)

1:32:54.693 --> 1:32:56.654
(Henrik groans loudly)
- Wait!

1:32:56.654 --> 1:32:58.906
(continues groaning)

1:32:58.906 --> 1:33:00.532
He is my brother.

1:33:00.532 --> 1:33:02.243
(Henrik breathes heavily)

1:33:02.243 --> 1:33:07.248
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:33:07.623 --> 1:33:08.541

1:33:18.675 --> 1:33:19.885
(Mograh thuds)

1:33:19.885 --> 1:33:21.219
(whimsical tones)

1:33:21.219 --> 1:33:25.891
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:33:29.061 --> 1:33:31.063
- So you'll kill me then?

1:33:31.063 --> 1:33:33.107
Your own brother?

1:33:33.107 --> 1:33:34.817
You have no loyalty, Bjorn.

1:33:36.235 --> 1:33:37.695
You will die!

1:33:37.695 --> 1:33:39.155
She will betray you!

1:33:40.072 --> 1:33:42.907
You know not what you choose.

1:33:42.907 --> 1:33:44.493
- It didn't have to be this way.

1:33:45.745 --> 1:33:48.289
- Your stupid and weak!

1:33:48.289 --> 1:33:50.291
Curses be upon you, Bjorn!

1:33:51.416 --> 1:33:52.877
(Henrik groans)
(skin squelching)

1:33:52.877 --> 1:33:56.297

1:33:58.633 --> 1:34:03.304
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:34:09.226 --> 1:34:11.312
- Goodbye, brother.

1:34:11.312 --> 1:34:13.606
May you fair better in the afterlife

1:34:13.606 --> 1:34:15.650
than you did in this one.

1:34:15.650 --> 1:34:18.402
(ominous dramatic music)
(sword clanks)

1:34:18.402 --> 1:34:21.781
(ominous dramatic music continues)

1:34:21.781 --> 1:34:22.615
- [Reina] Daddy!

1:34:24.157 --> 1:34:27.202
(dark ominous music)

1:34:29.330 --> 1:34:33.166
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:34:44.594 --> 1:34:45.680
- Reina, my child.

1:34:49.892 --> 1:34:53.646
You are so strong and brave.

1:34:56.273 --> 1:34:58.025
You are my everything.

1:34:58.025 --> 1:35:02.697
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:35:06.617 --> 1:35:09.829
Never forget how special you are.

1:35:15.501 --> 1:35:18.796
(smooching softly)

1:35:18.796 --> 1:35:23.050
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:35:23.050 --> 1:35:23.884
(water rushing)

1:35:23.884 --> 1:35:28.556
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:35:50.244 --> 1:35:53.289
Reina, love, this is our new home now.

1:35:55.249 --> 1:35:57.710
This is where you stay
when I fight for the king.

1:36:01.380 --> 1:36:02.548
You're with family now.

1:36:03.924 --> 1:36:08.596
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:36:13.601 --> 1:36:14.559
- Hi, Reina.

1:36:14.559 --> 1:36:15.561
I'm Evaline.

1:36:15.561 --> 1:36:17.146
Would you like to come play?

1:36:17.146 --> 1:36:21.776
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1:36:30.701 --> 1:36:32.327
- Thank you.

1:36:32.327 --> 1:36:34.371
- We are not your enemy, Ranger.

1:36:35.331 --> 1:36:36.165
- It would seem,

1:36:36.165 --> 1:36:38.041
given the rare circumstances
of the situation,

1:36:38.041 --> 1:36:40.419
which was the only option that could work.

1:36:40.419 --> 1:36:42.129
I am the last surviving Outlander.

1:36:43.005 --> 1:36:44.380
- Only we know where the hidden camp is

1:36:44.380 --> 1:36:47.175
that the dark shroud protects.

1:36:47.175 --> 1:36:49.844
- [Drustan] I suppose it's the
safest possible place then.

1:36:49.844 --> 1:36:50.846
- For them both.

1:36:53.766 --> 1:36:54.975
- I couldn't agree more.

1:36:56.309 --> 1:36:59.730
(intense dramatic music)

1:37:33.472 --> 1:37:34.306
- Ranger!

1:37:36.934 --> 1:37:41.188
(intense dramatic music continues)

1:37:58.873 --> 1:38:00.249
- [Drustan] It's finally over.

1:38:00.249 --> 1:38:01.083
(bag rustles)

1:38:01.083 --> 1:38:02.835
The long awaited rest.

1:38:04.128 --> 1:38:08.549
I feel free to act, free to serve.

1:38:09.967 --> 1:38:14.471
My sweet Reina safe and
sound with newfound friends

1:38:14.471 --> 1:38:15.764
who have become family.

1:38:17.224 --> 1:38:20.269
Curious how the shedding
of blood does that.

1:38:20.269 --> 1:38:22.478
How it renders preconceived ideas

1:38:22.478 --> 1:38:27.151
of what we once thought were
just and true irrelevant.

1:38:28.277 --> 1:38:29.945
But how did I become this,

1:38:31.530 --> 1:38:32.656
a creature of light?

1:38:33.699 --> 1:38:37.244
Was I forged in the furnace
of war like so many of us?

1:38:38.829 --> 1:38:39.914
I think not.

1:38:40.831 --> 1:38:42.082
I was saved,

1:38:43.041 --> 1:38:45.960
saved by a guardian
who saw better than me.

1:38:47.630 --> 1:38:50.966
Wrapped by sorrow from the
death of the Ancient One,

1:38:50.966 --> 1:38:52.968
I grew powerless to resist the urge

1:38:52.968 --> 1:38:56.013
to track down the thieving
bandits who stole his life.

1:38:56.889 --> 1:38:59.141
A promise I had made knowing full well

1:38:59.141 --> 1:39:00.809
I hadn't the strength to fulfill.

1:39:02.019 --> 1:39:03.145
The flesh is weak,

1:39:03.145 --> 1:39:05.689
and I succumb to the poison of vengeance.

1:39:06.898 --> 1:39:09.276
After many days of tracking,

1:39:09.276 --> 1:39:11.403
I finally took hold of their scent.

1:39:12.737 --> 1:39:14.031
What would happen next

1:39:14.031 --> 1:39:17.117
could only be explained as fate incarnate.

1:39:17.117 --> 1:39:20.537
(ominous dramatic music)

1:39:24.375 --> 1:39:26.335
- For a thievin' bandit like yourself,

1:39:26.335 --> 1:39:28.587
I didn't think you had it in ya.

1:39:28.587 --> 1:39:30.047
- [Drustan] Only two bandits.

1:39:30.047 --> 1:39:31.799
Where's the third?

1:39:31.799 --> 1:39:35.803
No matter, I could just
end them with arrows,

1:39:35.803 --> 1:39:38.389
but they need to be punished.

1:39:38.389 --> 1:39:39.306
- [Boss Bandit] They were ugly,

1:39:39.306 --> 1:39:41.016
(laughs) maybe that was why?

1:39:42.017 --> 1:39:43.978
- [Drustan] They don't
deserve a quick end.

1:39:43.978 --> 1:39:44.853
(fruit thuds)

1:39:44.853 --> 1:39:46.522
(Drustan groans)
(blow thuds)

1:39:46.522 --> 1:39:47.356
(liquid sloshing)

1:39:47.356 --> 1:39:48.523
(blows continue thudding)

1:39:48.523 --> 1:39:49.566
(Boss Bandit groans)

1:39:49.566 --> 1:39:50.776
(blows continue thudding)

1:39:50.776 --> 1:39:52.945
- Oh, you're mad (laughs).

1:39:52.945 --> 1:39:54.196
(blow thuds)
(arrow clatters)

1:39:54.196 --> 1:39:55.072
(blows continue thudding)

1:39:55.072 --> 1:39:56.240
(sword clanks)

1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:58.659
(air whooshing)
(skin squelching)

1:39:58.659 --> 1:40:00.327
You and your poison.

1:40:01.996 --> 1:40:03.580
(Drustan groans painfully)

1:40:03.580 --> 1:40:05.708
(Boss Bandit laughs)

1:40:05.708 --> 1:40:09.460
(Drustan continues groaning)

1:40:16.260 --> 1:40:18.053
What you're experiencing right now

1:40:18.053 --> 1:40:21.139
are the effects of a
decade long obsession.

1:40:21.139 --> 1:40:22.975
Kreiger here loves his poison.

1:40:22.975 --> 1:40:25.144
Now, I know Kreiger would love to

1:40:25.144 --> 1:40:27.521
explain the details of his concoction,

1:40:27.521 --> 1:40:30.357
but, well, years of
dedication to his craft

1:40:30.357 --> 1:40:31.900
have shriveled his tongue.

1:40:31.900 --> 1:40:33.193
Oh, don't worry,
(Drustan groans painfully)

1:40:33.193 --> 1:40:35.237
his poison won't kill ya.

1:40:35.237 --> 1:40:36.864
It'll just
(Drustan groans)

1:40:36.864 --> 1:40:40.784
incapacitate ya long
enough for us to kill.

1:40:42.036 --> 1:40:44.079
(Drustan continues groaning)

1:40:44.079 --> 1:40:46.790
(ax unsheathing)

1:40:46.790 --> 1:40:51.170
(Drustan continues groaning)

1:40:51.170 --> 1:40:52.796
(footsteps pattering)

1:40:52.796 --> 1:40:53.922
(blow thuds)
(arrows clatter)

1:40:53.922 --> 1:40:56.675
(both grunting)

1:40:56.675 --> 1:40:57.550
(sword clanks)

1:40:57.550 --> 1:40:58.594
(male groans)
(metal clangs)

1:40:58.594 --> 1:41:01.180
(metal clanks)

1:41:06.059 --> 1:41:09.563
(Drustan grunts softly)

1:41:09.563 --> 1:41:12.398
(apple crunching)

1:41:14.443 --> 1:41:17.862
- (sighs) What happened?

1:41:19.531 --> 1:41:21.742
- You were caught in a moment of weakness.

1:41:22.659 --> 1:41:23.535
You were spared.

1:41:26.496 --> 1:41:27.331
- Thank you.

1:41:27.331 --> 1:41:29.666
- But how eager you were
to forsake your oath.

1:41:31.293 --> 1:41:32.127
- Who are you?

1:41:32.127 --> 1:41:33.879
How do you know of my oath?

1:41:33.879 --> 1:41:36.298
- I am the watcher of these woods,

1:41:36.298 --> 1:41:39.050
and I know that you swore an
oath to your ancient ancestor

1:41:39.050 --> 1:41:42.054
that you would not seek
vengeance upon his killers.

1:41:42.054 --> 1:41:45.307
As I said, you were weak,

1:41:45.307 --> 1:41:46.850
and now I have spared you.

1:41:50.353 --> 1:41:51.939
- [Drustan] Spared me from what?

1:41:53.315 --> 1:41:54.775
- An awful fate, my friend,

1:41:56.485 --> 1:41:59.071
one that would consume your every thought,

1:41:59.071 --> 1:42:01.740
one that would lead you straight
to the forces of darkness.

1:42:01.740 --> 1:42:03.242
- And how do you know of this?

1:42:04.326 --> 1:42:08.330
- I was where you were once
after the death, Kiera.

1:42:13.001 --> 1:42:14.210
I was a lost soul.

1:42:15.587 --> 1:42:16.672
The Ancient One helped me

1:42:16.672 --> 1:42:19.133
fight against the darkness that crept in.

1:42:20.425 --> 1:42:21.760
I became a force for light.

1:42:23.637 --> 1:42:26.348
After I pledged myself to
protect the Borderlands,

1:42:27.683 --> 1:42:30.269
I fought the forces of
darkness for quite some time.

1:42:31.895 --> 1:42:34.731
And I remembered the
Ancient One telling me

1:42:35.607 --> 1:42:37.860
of a lost love and family he once had.

1:42:39.903 --> 1:42:41.572
I returned to these part.

1:42:43.448 --> 1:42:45.617
I've watched you train
for quite some time.

1:42:47.119 --> 1:42:51.039
I saw your potential
in skill and the heart.

1:42:52.541 --> 1:42:53.375
(fire whooshing)

1:42:53.375 --> 1:42:55.335
I witnessed his passing,

1:42:57.171 --> 1:43:01.758
and I witnessed your
oath sealed by his blood.

1:43:04.011 --> 1:43:06.680
(intense whooshing)

1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:10.559
- It would seem I owe
you a life debt, Ranger.

1:43:10.559 --> 1:43:11.476
- On the contrary.

1:43:13.228 --> 1:43:15.689
It is he who owes you a life debt.

1:43:20.235 --> 1:43:22.779
This here is the last remaining bandit.

1:43:24.198 --> 1:43:26.532
He claims he was forced
to kill the Ancient One,

1:43:26.532 --> 1:43:28.368
that he had no choice in the matter.

1:43:29.912 --> 1:43:32.496
I leave judgment to you, Drustan.

1:43:34.208 --> 1:43:35.666
As rangers in the Borderlands,

1:43:35.666 --> 1:43:37.920
we are the blade of the king.

1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:41.005
We are judge, jury and executioner.

1:43:42.257 --> 1:43:44.343
So what will it be, brother?

1:43:46.511 --> 1:43:48.388
Will it be justice or mercy?

1:43:56.021 --> 1:43:58.773
(birds chirping)

1:44:00.108 --> 1:44:03.946
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:44:44.820 --> 1:44:47.614
(whimsical tones)

1:44:49.657 --> 1:44:52.744
(dark ominous music)

1:45:22.523 --> 1:45:24.609
(child chants indistinctly)

1:45:24.609 --> 1:45:28.572
(triumphant instrumental music)

1:46:01.897 --> 1:46:05.192
(gentle ethereal music)
