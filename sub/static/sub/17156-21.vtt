[clattering]

00:08.342 --> 00:10.776
Fuzzy Legs? Do you think you
could secure those windows?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.547
And you'll alert me
if anything scary

00:15.549 --> 00:17.383
comes close to
the cottage?

00:17.385 --> 00:19.251
Oh, who am I kidding?

00:19.253 --> 00:22.221
<u>When</u> something scary comes
close to the cottage.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.456
Please tell me my
hiding place is ready.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.290
[growl]

00:27.761 --> 00:30.596
Oh, look, you've filled
it with everything I need

00:30.598 --> 00:32.664
to survive this awful night.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.036
Thank you. Thank you all!

00:37.038 --> 00:38.804
Now I don't have to
step a hoof outside

00:38.806 --> 00:40.572
until this whole
thing is over.

00:45.311 --> 00:48.147
Oh, no! You don't
have any carrots?

00:48.149 --> 00:51.216
Do we have any other fresh
veggies you may enjoy?

00:51.218 --> 00:52.418
Or maybe some hay?

00:53.787 --> 00:56.555
But that means I'll
need to go out...

00:56.557 --> 00:58.524
...ON NIGHTMARE NIGHT?

What are you doing
out and about?

02:17.538 --> 02:19.805
It's Nightmare Night, remember?

02:19.807 --> 02:21.373
How could I forget?

02:22.675 --> 02:24.510
Oh, I don't suppose
I could borrow

02:24.512 --> 02:26.812
a few pieces of
hay from you.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.148
I forgot to stock
up on food for Angel

02:29.150 --> 02:31.450
and you do seem to
have quite a lot.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.486
We need it for the Apple
Family Haunted Maze.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.524
The scariest maze
that there ever was.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.893
Who knows what
lurks inside?

02:40.895 --> 02:43.896
Oh, I'm sure I don't.

02:43.898 --> 02:46.532
Is that a mummified pony
that just leaped out at you?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.901
I don't know, is it?

02:48.903 --> 02:52.371
And what's that crunching
sound beneath your hooves?

02:52.373 --> 02:56.508
Maybe it's the bones of ponies
that didn't make it out alive!

02:56.510 --> 02:58.410
B-b-b-bones?

02:58.412 --> 03:02.347
Are those peeled grapes or
a thousand slimy eyeballs

03:02.349 --> 03:04.550
starin' at you from
beyond the grave?

03:04.552 --> 03:07.219
Please tell me
they're grapes.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.621
Oh, I'll never
tell. [evil laugh]

03:09.623 --> 03:11.256
[thunderclap]

03:11.258 --> 03:13.859
[frightened sobs]

03:13.861 --> 03:15.594
I wonder what got
stuck in her craw?

03:17.197 --> 03:20.232
[rumbling thunder]

03:23.803 --> 03:24.903
Twilight?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.341
Hello?

<i>â™ª [scary theme] </i>

03:38.552 --> 03:40.652
[scream]

03:40.654 --> 03:42.854
You think it's scary now.
Just wait until it's done.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.593
That's OK. I'll take
your word for it.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.295
[grunts]

03:50.297 --> 03:53.699
Hey, wait a minute!
It's Nightmare Night

03:53.701 --> 03:56.368
and you're here and not
holed up in your cottage!

03:56.370 --> 03:58.237
Does this mean what
I think it means?

03:58.239 --> 04:00.505
That I foolishly forgot to
stock up on food for Angel

04:00.507 --> 04:02.541
and had to go out
to get him something

04:02.543 --> 04:04.543
but got spooked in
town so I came here

04:04.545 --> 04:06.645
hoping Twilight had some
lettuce I could give him?

04:06.647 --> 04:08.480
Oh. I thought
maybe you'd decided

04:08.482 --> 04:14.286
Goodness, no! I couldn't be
out tonight. I just couldn't.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.521
Technically speaking, you
already are out right now.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.626
Oh. I guess that is true.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.528
So what if you stayed out a
little longer with your friends?

04:23.530 --> 04:25.430
I know they'd be super excited.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.732
You think so?

04:26.734 --> 04:28.967
You would make them SO
happy if you joined in.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.636
They wouldn't
believe their eyes.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.405
Come on, Fluttershy,
what do you say?

04:33.407 --> 04:38.277
[distant laughter]

04:38.279 --> 04:42.281
Pinkie Pie: And then it
got very, very quiet

04:42.283 --> 04:43.982
and suddenly they
realized

04:43.984 --> 04:47.352
the BALLOONS HAD
NEVER BEEN INFLATED!

04:47.354 --> 04:52.624
[screams and then laughter]

04:52.626 --> 04:57.062
Did I ever tell you about the
night the mannequin came to life

04:57.064 --> 04:59.498
and haunted all the costumes?

04:59.500 --> 05:00.999
What happened?

05:01.001 --> 05:02.567
I just told you, darling.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.503
A mannequin came to life and
haunted all the costumes.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.537
[squeal]

05:05.539 --> 05:06.838
Hi, everypony.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.473
[squeal]

05:08.475 --> 05:11.410
Fluttershy? What are you
doing here? Is everything OK?

05:11.412 --> 05:15.380
Everything is fine. In
fact, it's more than fine.

05:15.382 --> 05:18.717
I've decided to join you in your
Nightmare Night festivities.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.555
Seriously? You?
Out? Tonight?

05:25.525 --> 05:27.726
Every Nightmare Night I
shut myself in my cottage

05:27.728 --> 05:29.494
and refuse to come
out until morning.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.563
But it's just like when
I was afraid to sing

05:31.565 --> 05:32.998
in front of anypony.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.800
If I hadn't given it a try,

05:34.802 --> 05:37.669
I never would've found
out how much I enjoy it.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.672
And we'd have missed out
on how great you sound.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.041
Fluttershy with us
on Nightmare Night?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.976
Why that's positively
the most wonderful news

05:44.978 --> 05:47.346
I've heard in ages!

05:47.348 --> 05:49.514
You can get dressed up
in a costume with us

05:49.516 --> 05:50.882
and play Nightmare
Night games with us

05:50.884 --> 05:52.517
and eat candy apples with us!

05:52.519 --> 05:54.586
Don't forget the best part.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.089
Goin' through my
family's corn maze.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.758
Oh, right. The maze.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.994
Only if you're up for it.

06:02.996 --> 06:06.698
I am! I am ready to
take on Nightmare Night!

06:06.700 --> 06:08.767
AAAHHH!

06:08.769 --> 06:14.439
[nervous laughter]
Just practicing.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.948
â™ª

06:22.950 --> 06:28.120
[laughter]

06:28.122 --> 06:34.159
Mummy? No. Headless Pony?
No. Vampire Fruit Bat.

06:34.161 --> 06:37.562
Ugh, definitely no.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.532
You see, Fluttershy, the
beauty of Nightmare Night

06:40.534 --> 06:43.001
is that you don't have to
dress up as something scary.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.739
Ooh. Yes.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.741
This one will look
gorgeous on you.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.943
Period costumes are
all the rage this year.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.113
What? No good?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.715
What if we encounter
something terrifying

06:56.717 --> 06:58.150
and need to get
away quickly?

06:58.152 --> 07:02.053
All those layers could slow me
down, or worse, make me trip!

07:02.055 --> 07:04.623
I never
considered that.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.658
Never Fear!

07:06.660 --> 07:12.764
Oooh, now this is a real
stunner! I call it "Masquerade!"

07:12.766 --> 07:14.833
Just a simple black
dress underneath

07:14.835 --> 07:17.669
but with this ornately
decorated mask!

07:17.671 --> 07:18.804
A mask?

07:19.972 --> 07:21.640
No?

07:21.642 --> 07:24.576
They can just be so
difficult to see out of.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.512
Yes, but this one has eyeholes.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.614
What about being able to
see what's to the left

07:29.616 --> 07:31.917
or right of me?

07:31.919 --> 07:35.086
I suppose your vision
would be somewhat obscured.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.855
It's your first Nightmare
Night out and about

07:36.857 --> 07:38.757
and we do want you
to be comfortable.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.859
What if I just
wear the dress?

07:40.861 --> 07:45.697
Oh. Sure, dear.
That's fine.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.165
It's so plain,
it's frightening.

07:49.569 --> 07:54.005
Oh, my, look at all of you!
My costumes fit you to a T!

07:54.007 --> 07:56.842
Hoo-ee we're gonna
have the best time!

07:56.844 --> 07:59.511
[swinging door opens]

07:59.513 --> 08:02.547
Hey, Fluttershy,
where's your costume?

08:02.549 --> 08:03.582
I'm wearing it.

08:06.118 --> 08:09.187
I get it! You're a robber
escaping into the night!

08:09.189 --> 08:11.923
You're a NINJA escaping
into the night!

08:11.925 --> 08:14.726
YOU'RE BLACK LICORICE
escaping into the night!

08:14.728 --> 08:18.663
Close. I'm going to a masquerade
ball. Without the mask.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.236
Oh, that's great!
Isn't it great?

08:24.238 --> 08:25.704
Oh, yeah.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.571
Great costume.

08:26.573 --> 08:27.606
Pinkie: So creative!

08:27.608 --> 08:34.012
â™ª

08:34.014 --> 08:36.648
I figured I'd save the really
scary games for next year

08:36.650 --> 08:38.216
when Fluttershy's
more used to it.

08:38.218 --> 08:41.520
â™ª

08:41.522 --> 08:45.690
Round and round and round you
go where you stop nopony knows!

08:45.692 --> 08:47.025
OK, GO!

08:52.064 --> 08:54.533
Good luck beating
THAT, Fluttershy!

08:56.135 --> 08:59.170
Well, um. It's just
that if I'm blindfolded

08:59.172 --> 09:01.540
and somepony were to
leap out in front of me,

09:01.542 --> 09:03.308
I'd never have the
chance to defend myself.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.212
That's fine, darling.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.948
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.683
We're just glad
you're here.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.218
We don't have to
finish that game;

09:13.220 --> 09:17.055
I have another one I KNOW you'll
love! Bobbing for apples!

09:17.057 --> 09:18.790
[splash]

09:18.792 --> 09:20.025
[gulp]

09:20.027 --> 09:21.927
Fluttershy, what's wrong?

09:21.929 --> 09:24.162
It's just that, um,
what happens if,

09:24.164 --> 09:26.197
when my head is deep
down in the water,

09:26.199 --> 09:28.099
some kind of scary
monster appears?

09:28.101 --> 09:30.302
How would I even hear to
know I was under attack?

09:33.039 --> 09:35.040
Time for candy!

09:35.042 --> 09:36.074
It is?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.342
I made candy bags!

09:37.344 --> 09:39.911
Each bag has been made
with each of YOU in mind,

09:39.913 --> 09:42.213
complete with each of
your favorite candies!

09:43.783 --> 09:44.849
Awesome!

09:47.153 --> 09:50.822
Here. Take it. Take it!
What are you waiting for?

09:50.824 --> 09:52.624
Well, it's just...

09:52.626 --> 09:55.026
what if when I'm eating one
of these chewy taffies,

09:55.028 --> 09:58.029
my mouth becomes glued shut and
I can't scream for help?

10:04.337 --> 10:07.706
Oh, goodness. We've only
just started to celebrate

10:07.708 --> 10:09.274
Nightmare Night together

10:09.276 --> 10:12.911
and I'm already taking all
the fun out of it, aren't I?

10:12.913 --> 10:15.614
You're not taking
out ALL the fun.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.915
Just like, 90 per--

10:16.917 --> 10:18.249
[clang]

10:18.251 --> 10:19.618
--some of it.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.686
I really want to do this.

10:21.688 --> 10:25.390
But there's just so many things
that terrify me about tonight,

10:25.392 --> 10:27.959
I couldn't possibly predict
what might upset me.

10:31.397 --> 10:35.233
Unless... YOU were the
one doing the scaring!

10:35.235 --> 10:42.173
HER scaring US?
[hooting laughter]

10:42.175 --> 10:44.743
Oh, you're being serious.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.811
The thing you hate
is being scared,

10:46.813 --> 10:51.983
but if YOU'RE the one
doing the scaring then...

10:51.985 --> 10:54.185
....then I can help
you all have fun,

10:54.187 --> 10:57.022
and I can still be a
part of Nightmare Night!

10:57.024 --> 10:59.024
So you like that idea?

10:59.026 --> 11:00.692
I think I do!

11:00.694 --> 11:02.761
And I don't want to
get ahead of myself,

11:02.763 --> 11:05.997
but I think I have the PERFECT
idea for how I'm going to do it!

11:05.999 --> 11:08.700
Really? This is so exciting!

11:08.702 --> 11:12.370
Meet me at my
cottage in an hour.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.807
I'm excited to see
everypony soon!

11:15.809 --> 11:22.213

[Fluttershy scary voice] Welcome
<i>to Fluttershy's tea party!</i>

11:32.192 --> 11:34.793
Did she just
say tea party?

11:34.795 --> 11:37.962
It sounds like it's
a scary tea party?

11:39.098 --> 11:40.432
[sigh]

11:40.434 --> 11:41.733
<i>Fluttershy: Have a seat.</i>

<i>Go on. Pass the sugar.</i>

11:54.047 --> 12:01.186
<i>Oh, no! There is none!</i>
<i>You're a terrible host!</i>

12:01.188 --> 12:04.189
<i>Rarity, put your coat on!</i>

12:04.191 --> 12:06.257
Why would I do that?

12:06.259 --> 12:12.797
You need to cover up because no
one has complimented your dress!

12:12.799 --> 12:16.735
<i>Pinkie Pie, look to your left</i>
<i>and ask your best friend</i>

12:16.737 --> 12:20.739
to pass the cucumber sandwiches!

12:20.741 --> 12:24.476
Huh? I can't!
There's nopony there!

12:24.478 --> 12:29.147
<i>That's right. Because she</i>
<i>didn't care to show up!</i>

12:29.149 --> 12:30.782
What?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.317
<i>A friend who didn't</i>
<i>come through!</i>

12:32.319 --> 12:35.420
That must scare you to the core!

12:35.422 --> 12:37.989
<i>Quick, everypony,</i>
<i>look behind you!</i>

12:37.991 --> 12:40.859
Uh, what are those?

12:40.861 --> 12:45.296
<i>They're unplanned guests!</i>
<i>Your worst nightmare!</i>

12:45.298 --> 12:47.265
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>enough food for them!</i>

12:49.068 --> 12:53.138
<i>Oh, no! There's a tiny</i>
<i>kitten that needs a home!</i>

12:53.140 --> 12:55.540
<i>But you are</i>
<i>over-scheduled right now.</i>

12:55.542 --> 12:58.810
<i>You don't have time to help!</i>

12:58.812 --> 13:02.280
<i>I said, you don't</i>
<i>have time to help!</i>

13:04.917 --> 13:07.418
This should appear to scare you!

13:11.190 --> 13:14.125
Why don't you look terrified?
You showed up to a party

13:14.127 --> 13:16.494
and everypony was extremely
disappointed in you.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.464
Can you imagine
anything more upsetting?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.833
Rarity: It was a really
good try, darling

13:21.835 --> 13:23.201
but the scares at
Nightmare Night

13:23.203 --> 13:25.503
are of an entirely
different nature.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.106
It was really
creative, though.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.309
I never would have
thought of... all this.

13:32.878 --> 13:37.916
Oh, I'm just not cut out for
this. Just go on without me.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.318
Oh, no, we
couldn't possibly.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.322
You have to. This is the night
you look forward to all year.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.358
We could...stay here?

13:47.360 --> 13:50.829
It's OK. I really want
you all to have fun.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.064
This is how I spend
every Nightmare Night!

13:53.066 --> 13:57.402
Please go, I'll be fine.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.571
It's funny; I actually
thought she had an idea

13:59.573 --> 14:02.240
for something really
scary for a second there!

14:02.242 --> 14:04.075
She definitely
tried her hardest!

14:06.512 --> 14:09.113
I did try my hardest.

14:09.115 --> 14:12.917
[banging]

14:12.919 --> 14:15.186
Or maybe not.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.556
I suppose I could have gone
with something a bit scarier.

14:18.558 --> 14:22.327
You're right. I've
been taking baby steps.

14:22.329 --> 14:26.064
I think it's time
for grown up ones.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.967
I don't suppose you have any
ideas how I could do that?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.102
[growl]

14:33.607 --> 14:37.909
Everypony's lining up for the
corn maze, y'all. Let's go!

14:39.378 --> 14:41.913
Oh, yeah! I can't believe
we're finally doing this!

It's a good thing
Fluttershy isn't here

be able to handle this!

didn't know about any of this.

But maybe they're just tryin' to
make it interestin' for me too!

I'm sure Granny Smith or
Big Mac is behind this.

whole time?

I can't believe it!

19:17.257 --> 19:19.157
That. Was.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.791
THE BEST THING EVER!

19:22.394 --> 19:24.695
It was way more terrifying
than the most terrifying thing

19:24.697 --> 19:26.764
I could have thought of!

19:26.766 --> 19:29.934
You out-nightmared the scariest
part of the corn maze!

19:29.936 --> 19:32.503
How did you do all this?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.805
After you left, I realized
that I wasn't ready

19:34.807 --> 19:36.707
to give up on Nightmare Night.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.477
So I asked Granny Smith if I
could try to make the maze

19:39.479 --> 19:41.612
even scarier for
my friends.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.881
You came up with
all of this?

19:43.883 --> 19:45.683
I had some help.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.622
Angel was the scary figure
that kept scurrying after you

19:51.624 --> 19:53.324
in the maze.

19:55.427 --> 19:56.928
Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall

19:56.930 --> 19:59.230
that made it difficult
for you to see and move.

20:01.633 --> 20:05.436
And of course Hairy was the
especially scary monster.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.708
Wow. That was inspired.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.944
You have to do
this EVERY YEAR!

20:12.946 --> 20:15.913

20:15.915 --> 20:20.551
We could celebrate Nightmare
Night together every year.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.288
But the truth is I
really don't want to.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.923
You DON'T?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.558
But you've done it.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.828
You've found a way we can all
have a fabulous time together.

20:30.830 --> 20:34.932
Yes, but I've also
realized something.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.301
You all may love
Nightmare Night

20:37.303 --> 20:40.571
and I may be good at being a
part of it, but it's no fun

20:40.573 --> 20:43.341
for me to see my friends
feel like they're in danger,

20:43.343 --> 20:45.476
even if I know they're not.

20:45.478 --> 20:49.280
I really don't like it. It's
just not my cup of tea.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.250
Spooky tea?

20:52.252 --> 20:55.553
No. Just regular tea.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.289
We do lots of fun
things together.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.259
But I'm afraid this just isn't
going to be one of them.

21:01.261 --> 21:05.630
Actually, I'm not afraid;
I'm perfectly fine with it.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.698
Then we are too.

perfect Nightmare Night.
