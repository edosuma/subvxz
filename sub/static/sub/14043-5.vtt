00:10.366 --> 00:13.166
A bit of fuss down
at the church the other day.

00:14.466 --> 00:16.333
Glen.
GLEN: Wayne.

00:16.366 --> 00:17.700
How are you now?
GLEN: Good, and you?

00:17.733 --> 00:19.233
Oh, not so bad.

00:19.266 --> 00:21.100
Ooh, look what
you brought with you.

00:21.133 --> 00:23.766
Hello, Daryl.
Oh, fuck.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.633
Fuck, you're naked
as a jay bird.

00:25.666 --> 00:28.433
Wayne, it's humid.
It's the humidity.

00:28.466 --> 00:29.700
Y'all might want to
think about doing
the same thing,

00:29.733 --> 00:31.366
just pop your
pants right off,

00:31.400 --> 00:33.233
that way no one
gets sticky.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.566
Nope.
It's not so bad.
What's the fuss?

00:35.600 --> 00:39.366
Ma O'Dell mentioned something
about you helping her get
a squirrel out of her attic.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.200
I'm faced with
a similar conundrum.

00:41.233 --> 00:42.333
Right over there.

00:42.366 --> 00:45.066
It seems some kinda
rodent's made his home
over there.

00:45.100 --> 00:47.766
I have not seen him,
but I sure can smell him.
(CHUCKLES)

00:52.800 --> 00:54.233
(ANIMAL CHATTERING)
Hum.

00:55.066 --> 00:55.666
(EXHALES)

00:56.766 --> 00:57.800
It's a possum.
GLEN: Hmm.

00:57.833 --> 00:59.066
DARYL: Possum.
WAYNE: That's right.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.433
Oh, pitter patter,
let's get at 'er.

01:00.466 --> 01:02.733
Do you wanna know what?
I'd reach into a
pirate hooker's chamber pot

01:02.766 --> 01:04.600
before I'd reach in there.
And I'm going to tell ya.

01:04.633 --> 01:06.766
Possums are immune
to snake venom.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.633
They could probably survive
a nuclear blast.

01:08.666 --> 01:10.266
I think it's pronounced
new‐cue‐lar.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.133
Mmm, but it isn't.

01:12.166 --> 01:14.133
They're mutants.
They have forked
fuckin' penises.

01:14.166 --> 01:15.400
(SCOFFS)

01:15.433 --> 01:16.533
We should all be so lucky.

01:16.566 --> 01:18.500
They do this thing called
'Playing Possum'

01:18.533 --> 01:21.166
where they appear dead and
emit a death stink from
their butt holes, fuck.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.500
(SIGHS)
I found one
playing possum one time,

01:22.533 --> 01:24.166
thought it was dead
and buried it.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.566
It dug itself out
a few hours later

01:25.600 --> 01:27.500
and fucked a hen
right in front of her chicks.

01:27.533 --> 01:29.233
Wayne, think about
the swear jar.

01:29.266 --> 01:30.800
You're putting
so much money in.

01:30.833 --> 01:33.300
All right, let me take
peek see?
Pitter‐patter.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.400
Always had a skilled hand
in wrangling vermin.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.633
Thank you, Daryl.
And that doesn't surprise me.

01:37.666 --> 01:40.233
No sweat.
(GLEN LAUGHS) No sweat?

01:40.266 --> 01:44.100
In this heat?
That is rich and it's funny.

01:44.133 --> 01:46.533
Honestly though,
just take off your jumper.

01:46.566 --> 01:49.333
I'll hold it for you.
You crawl up in there,
no one gets dirty.

01:49.366 --> 01:51.066
Glen? Glen?
Yes.

01:51.100 --> 01:53.366
Let's take about 20%
off 'er up there, all right?

02:03.833 --> 02:06.166
Now, you wanna have an eye
because he'll come out
meaner and spit

02:06.200 --> 02:07.200
and go like a hot damn.

02:07.233 --> 02:09.566
Is he likely to bite?
Is a duck's ass watertight?

02:09.600 --> 02:11.200
Get ready to give him the
size nine's if he jukes by me.

02:11.233 --> 02:13.400
How be I give him the size
twelve and a halfs instead?

02:14.333 --> 02:16.200
(CHATTERING)

02:16.233 --> 02:19.100
Oh, I see him.
That's some drunk evolution
right there, bud.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.633
You gotta wonder what
two Christ‐made miscreants
mated to make that.

02:21.666 --> 02:23.600
It's almost not worth
thinkin' about.

02:23.633 --> 02:26.066
Do I just reach for him?
That's a better idea
than going in head first.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.533
Put him where?
Under my boot.

02:27.566 --> 02:30.633
(GLEN SIGHS) Boys, just do
your best not to make too big
a mess, all right?

02:30.666 --> 02:33.566
And I'm sorry again
about all this heat.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.733
Whoo‐hoo!

02:34.766 --> 02:36.233
Oh, for fuck‐sakes.

02:36.266 --> 02:37.066
(CHATTERING)
(THUD)

02:37.833 --> 02:38.733
Ow.

02:38.766 --> 02:41.400
You wish there was a
Pied Piper for possums,

02:41.433 --> 02:44.666
but there isn't, so you're
gonna have to just keep
pickin' 'em off with the .22.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.400
Buckle up
'cause they're fuckin' ugly.

02:48.533 --> 02:51.200
Of course, that's not to say
I have it all my damn self.

02:51.233 --> 02:52.233
(MUSIC PLAYING)

03:05.733 --> 03:08.633
Is that a herpe
on your hand, Daryl?

03:08.666 --> 03:12.100
Did you pay a little extra
to go all the way with a
ripper in the back room again?

03:12.133 --> 03:14.233
WAYNE: No, I don't think
he'd make that mistake twice.

03:14.266 --> 03:15.700
Got a little
trouser trauma?

03:15.733 --> 03:17.533
Was she fun
or was she fungal?

03:17.566 --> 03:19.533
(LAUGHS)
Hey, guess what?

03:19.566 --> 03:21.800
A guy's girlfriend
is having a hard time
parking the car, right?

03:21.833 --> 03:23.333
He says,
"You should get tested."

03:23.366 --> 03:24.800
She says, "Well no,
I'm not so bad at driving."

03:24.833 --> 03:26.433
He says,
"No, I have chlamydia."

03:26.466 --> 03:28.033
Is that a bite?

03:28.066 --> 03:30.100
The guy takes
a hooker out for supper.

03:30.133 --> 03:32.433
He gave her his peas,
she gave him herpes.

03:32.466 --> 03:34.400
Daryl, what happened?

03:34.433 --> 03:36.133
Did something bite you?
WAYNE: A possum.

03:36.166 --> 03:37.733
A possum?
WAYNE: That's right.

03:37.766 --> 03:39.466
Well, he could have rabies.
Boo fuckin' hoo.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.266
No, rabies is serious.
It attacks the
central nervous system.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.766
(VOMITS)

03:45.200 --> 03:46.400
(KATY SIGHS)

03:46.433 --> 03:49.066
If he gets puke between
the floor boards
it ain't coming out.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.466
WAYNE: Well, I can't take him
to the clinic.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.700
I gotta do an ice run
for the jamboree this week.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.100
KATY: Oh, Christ.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.233
Well, Daryl, we're gonna
have to take your van.

03:56.266 --> 03:59.300
Oh, yeah?
Where's your nut sack
boyfriend's today, Katy?

03:59.333 --> 04:01.300
They're at an away game
against the Natives.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.733
Oh, I bet they're
looking forward to playing
those tough pricks.

04:04.266 --> 04:05.366
Christ.

04:07.133 --> 04:09.300
(SIGHS)

04:09.333 --> 04:11.033
You sure you're ready
to saddle up to the
jamboree again?

04:11.066 --> 04:12.466
It was kind of you
and Angie's thing.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.500
No sense sittin'
on my hands.

04:14.533 --> 04:15.766
Time to find
a new dance partner.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.366
All right, Daryl.
Pitter‐patter.

04:28.066 --> 04:30.366
Hey, why are crabs
always so tired?

04:31.633 --> 04:33.600
It's 'cause they only
sleep in snatches.

04:38.533 --> 04:40.100
JONESY: Hey, wait a minute.
We're...

04:40.800 --> 04:42.400
We're missing two schmelts.

04:42.433 --> 04:44.100
Where are Deetzy and Burnsy?

04:44.133 --> 04:46.700
Oh, looks like a bad case
of the Native flu, bro.

04:46.733 --> 04:48.500
What's the Native flu?
You're an idiot.

04:48.533 --> 04:50.200
The Natives are
tough as hell.

04:50.233 --> 04:52.733
So another way to say someone
is chicken‐shit to play them

04:52.766 --> 04:54.300
is to say they have
the Native flu.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.466
Mix in a fuckin' clue,
brotato chip.

04:57.666 --> 04:59.400
Keep those fucking bags up,
schmelt.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.266
Wayne.
Bonnie, how are you now?

05:10.300 --> 05:12.333
Good and you?
Not so bad.

05:12.366 --> 05:14.033
This isn't all for you,
is it?
It sure is.

05:14.066 --> 05:15.300
Is it for the jamboree?

05:15.333 --> 05:16.466
If we ever get it there.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.433
Save me a dance?
Yup, sure.

05:18.466 --> 05:21.466
Thank you. I've always wanted
to dance with you, Wayne.
Oh, yeah?

05:21.500 --> 05:24.133
We've all been watching
you and Angie dance
for so long thinking

05:24.166 --> 05:25.733
when's it gonna
be our turns?
Oh, yeah?

05:25.766 --> 05:27.533
But trust me,
watching was enough.

05:27.566 --> 05:29.633
You used to move
her body around like
it didn't weigh a feather.

05:29.666 --> 05:31.633
Well, you know,
I think I got about a dozen
baker's dozen here

05:31.666 --> 05:33.800
I guess we could just
scan them and then
I'll get out of your hair.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.333
Oh, yeah,
I'll scan them.
Okay.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.300
It's broken.

05:39.266 --> 05:40.233
It'll be our little secret.

05:42.666 --> 05:44.033
(KATY SIGHS)

05:48.133 --> 05:49.700
Okay, sit down.
(DARYL BREATHING HEAVILY)

05:52.233 --> 05:53.266
Oh.

05:56.566 --> 05:57.733
Stewart?

05:58.333 --> 05:59.366
Katy?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.033
You look grisly.

06:01.066 --> 06:01.766
You look beautiful.

06:03.466 --> 06:06.100
But I can't quite
see you right now.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.300
What's wrong with you?
Meth?

06:08.333 --> 06:11.400
(LAUGHS) I don't know what
you're talking about.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.600
(SCOFFS)

06:14.633 --> 06:16.666
You're not
a teenager anymore.
It's not charming.

06:18.233 --> 06:19.233
I use to charm you?

06:20.666 --> 06:21.500
Wrong takeaway.

06:23.266 --> 06:25.200
You know,
you're not a fuckin' idiot.

06:25.233 --> 06:27.766
You could turn it around
if you wanted to.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.633
You know, I remember
sneaking into your parties
when I was 15,

06:31.666 --> 06:32.766
stealing your mix‐tapes.

06:33.633 --> 06:34.566
All your own music.

06:36.066 --> 06:37.200
I was really impressed.

06:38.333 --> 06:40.066
Guess those days
are over, though.

06:47.366 --> 06:50.133
All right, Dairy, let's go.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.033
Dairy, come on.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.033
(STRUGGLING)

06:54.066 --> 06:55.266
And yeah.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.400
You did use to charm me.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.433
McMurray, how're ya now?
Not so bad, and you?

07:07.466 --> 07:10.233
Not so bad.
I see you back
to the jamboree, now.

07:10.266 --> 07:12.366
A few weeks off there.
Oh, you noticed.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.633
Well, it's hard not to notice
all that Scottish tartan plaid
you seem to enjoy so much.

07:15.666 --> 07:17.666
I wanted to talk about
something important.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.700
Okay.
My sister Bonnie
is back from college,

07:19.733 --> 07:22.600
and she's a damn fine woman.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.533
Oh, yeah.
I just seen her down
at the dollar store, there.

07:24.566 --> 07:26.600
You sure it was her?

07:26.633 --> 07:29.500
I mean, last time I seen her
last she was in a kind of
a DIY maxi dress,

07:29.533 --> 07:32.433
but she may have added
a crochet pattern sweater
on account of the breeze.

07:32.466 --> 07:35.466
Maybe autumn foliage
or an Algonquin green?

07:36.600 --> 07:37.600
Okay.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.266
I think she'd be a damn fine
match for you, Wayne.

07:40.133 --> 07:41.433
That's if you're ready.

07:41.466 --> 07:42.733
You know, 'cause of
Angie and all.

07:42.766 --> 07:43.633
She's a lovely girl.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.400
(INHALES)

07:46.766 --> 07:48.033
(GURGLES)

07:48.066 --> 07:50.200
(BOTH SPEAK)

07:50.233 --> 07:52.266
No, you go ahead.
That is if you...

07:52.300 --> 07:54.400
But you started,
you mind finishing?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.466
Oh, it's just, was gonna say
the space, looks,

07:56.500 --> 07:58.133
looks nice and clean
without the...

07:58.166 --> 07:59.400
Yup.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.800
Run pretty good.

08:01.833 --> 08:04.533
Well, all right. All right.
Yeah. Hey, uh,
I'll let you carry on.

08:04.566 --> 08:07.366
It's a good box of ice. Yeah.
Yeah, good to see you.
Have a good one.

08:08.466 --> 08:10.533
Hey, wait.

08:10.566 --> 08:12.266
You save her dance now,
eh, big boy?

08:13.133 --> 08:14.300
Good enough,
McMurray.

08:14.333 --> 08:15.533
Atta boy.

08:15.566 --> 08:16.633
(MUSIC PLAYING)

08:16.666 --> 08:18.100
Does that taste right?

08:18.133 --> 08:19.766
Ya, okay.

08:21.066 --> 08:22.066
Mmm.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.433
(SUCKING)

08:26.366 --> 08:28.366
I think so, I don't know,
I don't know.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.633
I've had an epiphany!

08:29.666 --> 08:33.233
Uh, can you taste this?
No.

08:33.266 --> 08:35.466
Never again.
Okay, okay, okay,
then, can you snort it?

08:35.500 --> 08:38.400
No. I've given up
on the meth business.

08:38.433 --> 08:40.200
I'm going back
to the turntables.

08:41.366 --> 08:44.066
Hmm?
Back to the ones and twos.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.533
DEVON: For what?

08:45.566 --> 08:49.466
To become a superstar DJ.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.133
DEVON:
Oh, okay, okay, uh...

08:52.166 --> 08:53.800
But first, can you...
Let's just try...

08:53.833 --> 08:55.133
No.

08:56.433 --> 08:58.766
I need you guys to tell
everyone you know

08:58.800 --> 09:00.533
that I am hosting
a rave in Letterkenny,

09:00.566 --> 09:02.666
and I will be spinning
under all of my aliases.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.100
How many aliases
have you had?

09:05.133 --> 09:07.400
DJ Pimpy Longstockings,
DJ Peter Blumpkin,

09:07.433 --> 09:10.566
DJ White Power Nap,
DJ White Power Bottom.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.533
They'll all be there!
DEVON: All of them.

09:12.566 --> 09:15.733
Mmm‐mmm, so you're quitting
the meth business?

09:15.766 --> 09:18.633
I've quit the meth business.

09:18.666 --> 09:24.400
But Menergy Spa is still like,
a thing though, right?

09:24.433 --> 09:26.466
Well, how are you going
to get people to come?

09:26.500 --> 09:29.000
I'll post it on my
fuckin' Facebook.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.566
And you guys will post it

09:32.600 --> 09:34.733
on your fuckin' Facebooks.

09:43.733 --> 09:45.300
KATY: Wayne.

09:45.333 --> 09:47.333
Christ, Katy,
put some fuckin'
clothes on.

09:47.366 --> 09:48.533
Not my forte.

09:48.566 --> 09:49.400
Unfortunate.

09:50.766 --> 09:52.266
What are you doing?

09:52.300 --> 09:54.166
Well, I think it's
pretty obvious

09:54.200 --> 09:57.133
that I'm moving hay bales
from here over to here.

09:57.166 --> 09:59.066
Although, that one's
a straw bale.

09:59.566 --> 10:00.400
Why?

10:01.666 --> 10:04.400
(PHONE RINGING)

10:04.433 --> 10:07.200
Well, pick up your
fuckin' phone. McMurray's been
trying to reach you all day.

10:08.600 --> 10:09.633
(SNIFFS)

10:09.666 --> 10:12.200
(CLEARS THROAT) McMurray.
At least I was yesterday!

10:12.233 --> 10:13.500
How're ya now?
Not so bad and you?

10:13.533 --> 10:14.566
Not so bad.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.400
Listen, Wayne.
I've gotta cancel
the Jamboree here.

10:16.433 --> 10:17.633
The Ag Hall's been
booked up.

10:17.666 --> 10:19.233
For the whole week?
Yes, sir.

10:19.266 --> 10:22.800
That's Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday and guess what else?

10:22.833 --> 10:24.433
Sunday.
What for?

10:24.466 --> 10:26.800
Uh, Stewart.
He's throwing a rave.

10:26.833 --> 10:29.100
I don't know, he says
he needs time to set up
or something like that.

10:29.133 --> 10:31.366
Said something about a
glow stick Segway saunter

10:31.400 --> 10:34.700
across the rainbow road level
of Mario Kart for Nintendo 64?
I don't know, what the fuck.

10:34.733 --> 10:37.233
And you green‐lit
that tom‐fuckery?

10:37.266 --> 10:40.066
Had to. Agricultural Hall
is low on funds.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.566
All‐day bookings
is a big boost for us.
So, I couldn't say no.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.566
Agricultural Halls are
for Agricultural music.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.233
Not for fuckin' raves.

10:49.433 --> 10:51.766
Well, that's no way to get
your communication badge,
boy scout.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.700
(PHONE RINGS)

10:53.733 --> 10:57.233
Dairy.
DARYL ON PHONE: Wayne. Clinic.
Pick up. Not feel good.

10:59.300 --> 11:01.366
Well, he's not gonna get
his communication badge,
either.

11:08.066 --> 11:09.066
(HONKING)

11:11.133 --> 11:12.800
Dairy.
What's the fuss?

11:12.833 --> 11:14.066
Good 'n you?

11:14.100 --> 11:15.800
Where you goin'?

11:15.833 --> 11:17.500
I don't know where I am.

11:17.533 --> 11:19.300
Don't look at your hand.
What's the fuss?

11:20.766 --> 11:22.166
Think I have rabies.

11:22.200 --> 11:25.333
Oh, boo fuckin' hoo,
big shootsy‐wootsy.

11:25.366 --> 11:27.466
But 'cept do you wanna
know what?
What's that?

11:27.500 --> 11:29.366
Nabbing that possum
was kind of a thrill.

11:30.466 --> 11:32.333
I think I could start
a pest removal business.

11:32.366 --> 11:34.460
Oh, Daryl,
that's just silly.

11:37.094 --> 11:39.294
But 'cept do you wanna know
what? I'm gonna help you..

11:39.327 --> 11:41.127
You know Stewart's having
a rave at the Ag Hall?

11:41.160 --> 11:42.827
Agricultural Halls are for
agricultural music.

11:42.860 --> 11:44.927
"Not for fuckin' raves."
That's what I said.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.927
So here's what we're gonna do
and I'm gonna tell ya.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.894
We're gonna wrangle as many
of those critters as possible,

11:48.927 --> 11:51.060
and let 'em loose
at Stewart's rave.

11:51.094 --> 11:52.494
How do we get the word out
about the business?

11:52.527 --> 11:54.427
Oh, you'd have to put it
on your fuckin' Facebook,
likely.

11:55.927 --> 11:57.094
Over and out.

11:57.960 --> 11:58.960
(THUD)

12:13.260 --> 12:15.827
TANIS: Look at this
bowl of fruit salad.
You want a taste, Tanis?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.994
Ooh, better watch
that bark there.
Boy might get bit.

12:18.027 --> 12:20.327
(BARKING)
(BARKING)

12:20.360 --> 12:22.327
What's going on here?
You're looking
a handful short.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.160
Caught a bad case
of the Native flu, or what?

12:24.194 --> 12:26.260
You're drunk.
Mix in a water.

12:26.294 --> 12:29.294
Well, it's either that or
you're all tweaking down
that meth town you come from.

12:29.327 --> 12:31.894
What did you say?
Everyone knows Letterkenny
has gone to meth.

12:31.927 --> 12:33.227
You guys a bunch of
fuckin' basics.

12:33.260 --> 12:35.494
At least we keep it clean.
We just sell cigarettes.

12:35.527 --> 12:38.794
Your town ain't nothing
but a bunch of jacked‐up
scab pickers.

12:38.827 --> 12:42.294
Yeah, we'll see what you're
calling us after I bury
a couple of bar down wristers.

12:42.327 --> 12:43.760
Half‐clapper,
top cheddar.

12:43.794 --> 12:45.427
Biscuits top titties,
bar downskies.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.994
Always bar downskie.

12:47.027 --> 12:49.194
Pull out the guns.
Safetys off.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.394
Fuckin' safety
off, boys.

12:50.427 --> 12:51.494
A little three‐on‐oneskie?

12:51.527 --> 12:52.494
A little three‐on‐twoskie?

12:52.527 --> 12:55.227
Hum a high hard one.
Hit the red light district.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.860
You won't make it that far,
slugger.

12:56.894 --> 12:58.027
You either, champ.
Buckets off.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.094
Center ice.
Puck drop.

12:59.127 --> 13:00.060
Shed 'em.
AXE: Go me.

13:00.094 --> 13:02.260
A little fuck me,
fuck you.
Free nose jobs.

13:02.294 --> 13:03.960
Let's dance.
Let's hit the d‐floor.

13:03.994 --> 13:05.894
My balls dangle
harder than you, boy.

13:05.927 --> 13:07.694
(VOMITS)
(TANIS LAUGHS)

13:10.294 --> 13:12.427
TANIS: Like I thought,
bad case of the Native flu.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.060
(MUSIC PLAYING)

13:18.294 --> 13:20.794
Devon, we're missing $2000.

13:20.827 --> 13:23.194
Really?
It's a devastating blow to
Menergy Spa, I know.

13:23.227 --> 13:26.127
Hey, I'll call Stewart.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.327
(MUMBLING)
He'll fix everything...

13:27.360 --> 13:28.794
(PHONE RINGING)

13:30.360 --> 13:32.027
Hello?
Stewart?

13:32.060 --> 13:33.127
Hey, Devon.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.294
Hey, we're missing 2k.
Yeah, I took it
for the rave.

13:37.994 --> 13:39.360
2k?

13:39.394 --> 13:41.794
(STAMMERS)
I don't think
you understand.

13:41.827 --> 13:45.327
It's going to be
a massive production.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.460
It's gonna be
like an...

13:47.494 --> 13:50.460
Aurora Borealis‐themed
Salvador Dali drug orgy

13:51.327 --> 13:52.460
with shamans.

13:54.027 --> 13:56.060
(STAMMERING) But that's a
lot of money.

13:56.094 --> 13:57.694
No time,
I gotta go.

14:04.294 --> 14:06.194
Wayne. Daryl.

14:06.227 --> 14:07.160
Gailor, how are ya now?

14:07.194 --> 14:08.427
I'm on a juice cleanse.

14:08.460 --> 14:10.427
Haven't had a drink
in three days.

14:10.460 --> 14:11.860
Had close to
30 shits, though.

14:11.894 --> 14:12.994
So what's the fuss?

14:13.027 --> 14:14.960
Well, timing's right
for your new business.

14:14.994 --> 14:16.960
Saw it up on your
fuckin' Facebook, there.

14:16.994 --> 14:18.760
Got a skunk sleeping
underneath us, right now.

14:18.794 --> 14:21.160
Did you not know skunks
are immune to bee stings?

14:21.194 --> 14:23.994
They even teach their babies
how to raid beehives.

14:24.027 --> 14:25.894
And?
Well, they burrow up
for the winter,

14:25.927 --> 14:27.794
and rip farts on each other
to keep warm.

14:27.827 --> 14:29.327
No way.
Oh, yeah.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.160
They go to mate as soon
as they leave their mom,

14:31.194 --> 14:34.727
so you know they're
probably thinking about her
during sex.

14:34.760 --> 14:37.394
That or their brothers
and sisters which is
even more inappropriate.

14:37.427 --> 14:39.127
(GAIL FARTING) Oh.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.860
There's one knocking.
Make way.

14:45.527 --> 14:47.360
Well, pitter‐patter.

14:49.227 --> 14:51.260
Can you take this one,
please?

14:51.294 --> 14:53.860
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Here's the deal.

14:53.894 --> 14:57.127
Stewart's rave is eating up
all our money,

14:57.160 --> 15:00.460
and the business is failing
without his expertise.

15:00.494 --> 15:03.360
We simply aren't making
enough coin selling
the Native's cigarettes.

15:04.260 --> 15:05.260
We need the meth.

15:05.294 --> 15:07.860
Menergy Spa is never
going to happen at this rate.

15:07.894 --> 15:10.760
I officially move to
boycott Stewart's rave,

15:10.794 --> 15:14.327
take it off our
fuckin' Facebooks
and sabotage it.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.994
All in favor say,
"Aye!"

15:17.027 --> 15:18.960
EVERYONE: Aye!

15:18.994 --> 15:20.460
It's unanimous.

15:21.460 --> 15:22.294
How are we
going to do this?

15:22.327 --> 15:23.860
We could put something
on our Facebooks.

15:25.394 --> 15:27.194
We could say the Ag Hall
has asbestos.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.927
Yes, asbestos.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.360
Everyone hates asbestos.
Asbestos is the answer.

15:31.994 --> 15:33.427
Okay.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.827
Let's do that.

15:35.860 --> 15:38.394
Maybe you don't say
asbestos anymore, though.

15:38.894 --> 15:39.894
Okay.

15:49.994 --> 15:53.760
Hey, Katy,
you look beautiful.

15:54.227 --> 15:56.727
You look better.

15:57.327 --> 15:58.827
Um.

15:58.860 --> 16:01.294
I've come to cordially
invite you to my rave tonight.

16:02.794 --> 16:03.794
(ANIMAL CHATTERING)

16:06.960 --> 16:08.194
Stewart.

16:08.227 --> 16:09.860
Fuck, greasiest skid I
ever seen.

16:09.894 --> 16:11.994
Criss Angel mind‐freak‐
looking‐motherfucker.

16:12.027 --> 16:13.960
What are you thinking
holding a rave at the Ag Hall?

16:13.994 --> 16:17.127
I'm thinking I'm doing
the Agricultural Society
a huge favor.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.727
You guys are going broke.
Tits up or not,
it's inappropriate.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.060
Why not the Legion?

16:21.094 --> 16:22.460
Or even upstairs
at the arena?

16:22.494 --> 16:24.127
Or the fuckin'
youth center.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.794
Because they're too small,
shirt‐tucker.

16:26.827 --> 16:30.060
Be prepared, because once
this blows up they'll probably
ask me to do it quarterly.

16:30.994 --> 16:32.094
Bi‐weekly!

16:32.127 --> 16:33.760
Mmm‐hmm.
Mmm‐hmm.

16:33.794 --> 16:35.727
We'll see if it
blows up then.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.494
It'll probably be pretty tough
to find me through the crowd.

16:39.527 --> 16:42.894
Stage security will be
pretty tight but your name's
on the guest list,

16:42.927 --> 16:46.060
and there's
a backstage pass
with your name on it.

16:46.094 --> 16:47.327
I'll do my best to
make it down, Stewart.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.427
My ass.

16:48.460 --> 16:51.160
And just as a heads up,
it is a rave,

16:51.194 --> 16:53.960
so there will probably be
people on drugs.

16:53.994 --> 16:55.794
You know, MDMA.

16:55.827 --> 16:58.094
What? There's gonna be
MDMA at the Ag Hall?

16:58.127 --> 17:00.394
Yes, there will be MDMA
at my rave at the Ag Hall.

17:00.427 --> 17:03.394
There will be MDMA,
DMT, PCP, LSD,

17:03.427 --> 17:05.727
LED and probably UFC.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.960
But I am clean
and sober.

17:12.994 --> 17:15.027
You are spare parts,
aren't you, bud?

17:15.060 --> 17:16.860
(CLEARS THROAT)

17:16.894 --> 17:20.860
I truly hope
to see you there.

17:23.194 --> 17:26.027
Watch your fuckin'
hands, skid.

17:26.060 --> 17:28.427
Three, two...

17:44.527 --> 17:47.094

turning Letterkenny
into a gong show, buddy.

17:47.127 --> 17:48.727
JONESY: Fucking gonger, buddy.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.760
I'm rattled about that
meth chirp, brotein.

17:51.994 --> 17:54.160
Fuckin' Stewart, bro.
Fuckin' Stewart, bro.

17:56.027 --> 17:58.260
There's fuckin' two
in that pud, hey, boys?

17:58.294 --> 17:59.994
Put 'em away like a
winter coat, boys.

18:03.994 --> 18:05.260
What the fuck
was that?

18:07.227 --> 18:08.194
That was garbage.

18:08.227 --> 18:10.427
That was fuckin' pedestrian.

18:10.460 --> 18:13.060
All this beaking
is kiddie pool shit.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.960
Is that what you want?
Riley, Jonesy?

18:16.994 --> 18:18.294
Huh?

18:18.327 --> 18:20.794
You want to get dropped off
at the splash pad
on the way home, eh?

18:20.827 --> 18:23.160
Get mom and dad
to pick you up after
you all swim?

18:23.194 --> 18:25.127
No running on the deck,
ya fuckin' pheasants.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.427
Fuck!

tug, you tit‐fucker!

18:50.394 --> 18:52.694
You never looked so good.

18:53.827 --> 18:56.694
You never felt so good.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.060
I'm so proud of you, man.

19:06.260 --> 19:07.727

20:19.360 --> 20:21.827
Where's Stewart, buddy?
Where is he, bro?

20:21.860 --> 20:23.260
Rave's canceled.
Go home.

20:23.294 --> 20:26.094
Bullshit, buddy.
That's not what the
poster says, buddy.

20:26.127 --> 20:27.760
I said,
it's fuckin' canceled.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.760
Now quit your hollering
before I get cross.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.827

20:32.860 --> 20:34.260
When he give a warning,
he don't repeat it.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.227
Yeah.

20:36.260 --> 20:37.994
Seven of us and two of you.

a donnybrook, boys.

What the fuck are you
pheasants doing out here?

20:43.494 --> 20:45.260
It's 10 minutes to curfew.

20:45.294 --> 20:47.727
You think you can dog fuck
all night and then dance?

20:48.927 --> 20:50.894
Dog fuckin'
means no dancin'.

20:50.927 --> 20:51.960
Get home!

20:52.860 --> 20:54.127
It's fuckin' embarrassing.

20:57.827 --> 21:00.360
Well, pitter‐patter.

21:00.394 --> 21:02.394

MCMURRAY (ON PHONE):
Wayne, I've been told
the rave was a bust.

21:20.394 --> 21:23.727
Something about an asbestos
scare or something.
No one showed up.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.860
Sister Bonnie, though,
she's still in there.

21:25.894 --> 21:27.060
About that dance
you were going to save her.

21:27.094 --> 21:30.860
<i>She'll be in a sort of golden</i>
<i>poppy progressive onesie.</i>

21:30.894 --> 21:33.160
Either way, you know,
get in there, pal.

21:33.194 --> 21:34.460
Give 'er the guts.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.460
Okay.
Bang the very guts
right out of her.

21:37.494 --> 21:40.327
Okay.
Just have at her, bud, like...

22:14.194 --> 22:16.827
This is a grotesquerie.

22:24.460 --> 22:27.394
It's off.

22:28.527 --> 22:30.827
We are going to make
Letterkenny

22:30.860 --> 22:33.960
