01:25.695 --> 01:29.069
Ohh--no...

01:29.071 --> 01:32.469
Shh.

02:02.820 --> 02:04.292
Edward Ray Stokes, FBI!

02:04.294 --> 02:05.726
Drop the gun!

02:05.728 --> 02:06.891
You first.

02:06.893 --> 02:09.229
We got your
letters, Edward.

02:09.231 --> 02:12.901
I read every single one
of them.

02:12.903 --> 02:14.069
Then you understand.

02:14.071 --> 02:17.438
Yeah, I understand
that you're angry...

02:17.440 --> 02:20.110
And you hurt inside.

02:21.978 --> 02:25.249
But that girl,
her name is Sheryl

02:25.251 --> 02:26.914
and she is not
your mother.

02:26.916 --> 02:30.621
She didn't hurt you
like your mother did.

02:30.623 --> 02:33.125
She needs to die.

02:33.127 --> 02:34.429
No. Not today.

02:34.431 --> 02:37.104
Put it down, Edward!

02:42.443 --> 02:44.176
Ah!

02:44.178 --> 02:46.440
Blake. Are you all right?

02:46.442 --> 02:47.778
Yeah.

02:47.780 --> 02:49.082
We need a medic!

02:49.084 --> 02:50.716
I'm all right.
I'm ok. I'm all right.

03:04.337 --> 03:07.778
Uh-huh. You got it, Hotch.
We'll meet you at the airport.

03:07.780 --> 03:08.843
Hey.

03:08.845 --> 03:10.243
You sure you're ok?

03:10.245 --> 03:11.885
Oh, yeah.
It's nothing.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.454
A couple inches to your right and
he could have hit your brachial artery.

03:14.456 --> 03:16.854
All things considered,
you were extraordinarily lucky.

03:16.856 --> 03:18.325
Yeah, luck had nothing
to do with it.

03:18.327 --> 03:19.420
I'm practically
bulletproof.

03:19.422 --> 03:20.660
Yeah, I heard that
about you.

03:22.094 --> 03:24.525
All right, let's finish
this up and go home.

03:25.462 --> 03:28.134
Hey, Dad.

03:28.136 --> 03:30.165
Yeah, I'm good.

03:30.167 --> 03:31.774
How are you doing?

03:31.776 --> 03:34.971
No, no, we're just
finishing up here.

03:34.973 --> 03:36.675
No, we're actually,

03:36.677 --> 03:38.308
uh, in sunny Los Angeles.

03:38.310 --> 03:41.381
Why? Everything ok?

03:42.316 --> 03:44.238
Help with what?

03:48.776 --> 03:49.942
Ok, sir, I'm ready.

03:49.944 --> 03:52.405
All right. Can I have
your attention, everyone.

03:52.407 --> 03:53.643
Go ahead, Garcia.

03:53.645 --> 03:55.179
Alrighty, then.
Last night in Kansas City--

03:55.181 --> 03:57.179
well, technically
super early this morning--

03:57.181 --> 03:58.130
50-year-old David Morrison

03:58.155 --> 04:00.148
was beaten to death
when he was out jogging.

04:00.149 --> 04:04.081
Information is on
your tablets right now.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.784
It looks brutal.

04:05.786 --> 04:09.383
Classic overkill.

04:09.385 --> 04:11.886
He was found stripped
and wearing women's underwear

04:11.888 --> 04:13.657
that I'm assuming
weren't his.

04:13.659 --> 04:16.562
Yeah. All of his clothes were
found nearby, his skivvies included.

04:16.564 --> 04:18.233
Any evidence
of sexual assault?

04:18.235 --> 04:19.926
We're still waiting
on the M.E. report.

04:19.928 --> 04:21.596
Any other victims, Garcia?

04:21.599 --> 04:22.933
That is a big maybe.

04:22.935 --> 04:25.029
Meet Tommy Barnes
and Melissa Hawthorne,

04:25.031 --> 04:26.501
also on your tablets.

04:26.503 --> 04:28.405
A year ago they disappeared
from a house party

04:28.407 --> 04:30.203
and were found beaten
in much the same fashion.

04:30.205 --> 04:32.403
There were two of them and
they're considerably younger

04:32.405 --> 04:33.741
than this most recent victim.

04:33.743 --> 04:35.576
Yeah, and what about
the women's underwear?

04:35.578 --> 04:37.584
And that's a pretty
specific ritual aspect.

04:37.586 --> 04:39.214
These two were found
fully clothed.

04:39.216 --> 04:41.746
Are we sure that
it's the same unsub?

04:41.748 --> 04:43.218
My dad thinks it is.

04:43.220 --> 04:45.785
Your dad's a captain on th
 Kansas City police force, right?

04:45.787 --> 04:46.784
Retired.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.152
But your brother's a cop, too.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.353
Scott. He's
a homicide detective,

04:49.355 --> 04:51.322
but my dad is the one
who made the call.

04:51.324 --> 04:54.427
If he's retired, it's not
exactly an official invitation.

04:54.429 --> 04:56.593
No, but he's got
lots of influence.

04:56.595 --> 04:58.697
Well, maybe we should
wait for the invite.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.034
We can't just force ourselves
on local jurisdiction.

05:01.036 --> 05:03.096
What if it's actually
serial?

05:03.098 --> 05:05.071
We'll go back
if they ask us to.

05:05.073 --> 05:07.607
Look, my dad's a great cop,
and he's almost never wrong.

05:07.609 --> 05:10.041
I mean, it drives me crazy,
but it's true.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.871
We don't know exactly
what we've got here,

05:11.873 --> 05:13.574
but I think it's worth
taking a look.

05:13.576 --> 05:16.277
Have the pilot reroute us
to Kansas City.

05:43.047 --> 05:45.612

05:45.614 --> 05:48.017

"Brothers and sisters

06:42.454 --> 06:44.885
Vietnamese proverb.

06:46.822 --> 06:48.890
David Morrison
was a novelist,

06:48.891 --> 06:50.424
Tommy Barnes and Melissa
Hawthorne high school students.

06:50.426 --> 06:52.358
No apparent connection
between the victims,

06:52.360 --> 06:53.725
no matching DNA samples.

06:53.727 --> 06:55.356
And an entire year
between kills.

06:55.358 --> 06:57.824
You know, the underwear ritual
may be about symbolic humiliation.

06:57.826 --> 07:00.160
Or a shock factor for
whoever found the bodies.

07:00.162 --> 07:02.205
Blake, did your dad say anything
else about why he thinks

07:02.230 --> 07:03.599
these cases are connected?

07:04.867 --> 07:07.468
Blake?
Yeah?

07:07.470 --> 07:09.539
Everything all right?

07:09.541 --> 07:10.539
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

07:10.541 --> 07:12.673
Just--I'm distracted.

07:12.675 --> 07:15.502
Perfectly understandable.
The familiar sounds, visual cues,

07:15.504 --> 07:17.840
even olfactory inputs,
can trigger memories and emotions

07:17.842 --> 07:19.255
we thought were long gone.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.375
Happens to me every time
I go home, too.

07:20.376 --> 07:21.908
When was the last time
you were back?

07:21.910 --> 07:23.245
It's been like 422 days.

07:23.247 --> 07:24.550
I was talking to Blake.

07:24.552 --> 07:26.952
Uh, it's been about 5 years.

07:26.954 --> 07:28.384
That's a long time.

07:28.386 --> 07:31.389
Yeah, once I got out
of Kansas City,

07:31.391 --> 07:34.528
I pretty much wanted
to stay out.

07:34.530 --> 07:36.929
Her oldest brother was
responding to an armed robbery.

07:36.931 --> 07:39.867
Apparently the bad guys
were on PCP.

07:39.869 --> 07:42.773
Both he and his partner
got shot and he got the worst of it.

07:42.775 --> 07:44.741
How come we don't know
any of this?

07:44.743 --> 07:46.508
What's she supposed to say?

07:46.510 --> 07:47.906
I don't know.

07:47.908 --> 07:49.073
Something.

07:49.075 --> 07:50.408
Well, Blake's
a private person.

07:50.410 --> 07:52.449
Maybe she doesn't want
to talk about her family.

07:52.451 --> 07:54.985
Plus it was over 25 years ago.
A lot of time has passed.

07:54.987 --> 07:56.353
I lost my father
the same way.

07:56.355 --> 07:57.649
It's not like
I can't relate.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.551
Yeah, but you rarely
talk about him.

08:00.553 --> 08:02.717
Everybody grieves
in their own way.

08:02.719 --> 08:05.019
You can't be mad at her
for going internal.

08:05.021 --> 08:07.288
Oh, I'm not mad at all.
I just...

08:07.290 --> 08:09.991
Thought she might say
something.

08:12.057 --> 08:13.592
There's nothing
for you to do here.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.728
When dad has a hunch,
you know how he gets.

08:15.730 --> 08:18.261
Yeah, he called
Captain Garrity directly.

08:18.263 --> 08:19.996
So, now what?

08:19.998 --> 08:22.597
Well, the captain wants me
to cooperate, that's what.

08:22.599 --> 08:24.167
But you're wasting your time.

08:24.169 --> 08:25.839
Dad doesn't
seem to think so.

08:25.841 --> 08:27.485
Look, those kids
had nothing to do with

08:27.510 --> 08:28.872
the Morrison murder, ok?

08:28.873 --> 08:30.375
They were killed
down on Prospect

08:30.377 --> 08:32.174
because they were out
trying to cop some weed.

08:32.177 --> 08:33.375
Prospect?

08:33.376 --> 08:36.150
Uh, Prospect Avenue.
It's a high crime area.

08:36.153 --> 08:37.119
It's the hood.

08:37.121 --> 08:38.381
Detective Miller,
I assure you

08:38.384 --> 08:39.885
we're not here
to intrude.

08:39.888 --> 08:41.486
And I feel certain
that in 24 hours

08:41.488 --> 08:43.919
we'll be able to discern
whether these cases are related.

08:43.921 --> 08:46.159
We're really good
at what we do, Scott.

08:46.161 --> 08:47.495
Of course you are.

08:47.497 --> 08:49.327
Alex?

08:49.329 --> 08:50.430
There.

08:50.432 --> 08:51.999
Dad.

08:52.001 --> 08:55.429
Oh...been so long.

08:55.431 --> 08:57.997
You look good.
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

08:57.999 --> 08:59.803
I was down in
Garrity's office.

08:59.805 --> 09:00.938
You must be Hotchner.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.203
Yes, sir.
Damon Miller.

09:02.205 --> 09:03.540
Very nice to meet you.

09:03.542 --> 09:04.677
Appreciate you coming,

09:04.679 --> 09:07.708
and thanks for taking
such good care of my girl.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.243
So what's the plan
of attack?

09:12.148 --> 09:14.019
This place
is pretty isolated.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.452
It helps to be
out in the sticks

09:16.454 --> 09:18.523
if you're going to
beat someone to death.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.419
You sound like you speak
from experience.

09:20.421 --> 09:21.387
Hmm.

09:21.389 --> 09:25.028
David Morrison
was a 50-year-old novelist

09:25.030 --> 09:28.564
and apparently
an accomplished triathlete.

09:28.566 --> 09:31.206
Good place for an ambush.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.376
But why pick
the in-shape guy?

09:33.378 --> 09:35.943
Morrison could have been
a target.

09:35.945 --> 09:38.208
Maybe he knew his killer.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.512
But they may have had
some kind of a beef.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.509
Beating someone to death
is personal.

09:42.511 --> 09:44.012
It takes a lot of anger.

09:44.014 --> 09:46.184
Well, the unsub's got to be
physically fit himself.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.258
Yeah, he would have to be
to maintain that level of violence.

09:49.260 --> 09:50.930
He could also be on drugs.

09:50.932 --> 09:52.698
That's a good bet.

09:52.700 --> 09:55.300
All right, so, it looks
like it's a blitz attack.

09:55.302 --> 09:57.731
How do you think
he did it?

09:57.733 --> 10:00.738
Well, the unsub
stalks Morrison

10:00.740 --> 10:03.242
and figures out
that this is

10:03.244 --> 10:05.611
where he takes
his morning run.

10:05.613 --> 10:08.315
Then he waits, hides,

10:08.317 --> 10:09.716
jumps him.

10:09.718 --> 10:11.823
Or he follows him
out here,

10:11.825 --> 10:14.919
runs him down, even though
Morrison is a triathlete.

10:14.921 --> 10:17.423
Well, I just hope this guy
doesn't have any more targets.

10:17.425 --> 10:19.063
If this is rage
and addiction...

10:19.065 --> 10:21.463
he's not done.

10:22.295 --> 10:23.397
I'm just saying,

10:23.399 --> 10:24.597
you could have
called me, Dad.

10:24.599 --> 10:25.965
Going straight to my boss?

10:25.967 --> 10:27.101
Oh, and her.

10:27.103 --> 10:28.365
I mean, how do you think
this makes me look?

10:28.367 --> 10:30.734
Because why?
Because you have a hunch?

10:30.736 --> 10:34.080
And what would you
have said if I'd called?

10:34.082 --> 10:35.080
I'd...

10:35.082 --> 10:36.776
Uh-huh.

10:36.778 --> 10:38.616
Exactly.

10:38.618 --> 10:41.211
And it's not like she would ever
reach out and offer.

10:41.213 --> 10:42.914
She hasn't been home
in 5 years.

10:42.916 --> 10:45.081
I had to fly out to
Washington just to see her.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.416
I'm right here, you know.

10:46.418 --> 10:48.049
Look,
all I'm saying, Dad,

10:48.051 --> 10:51.152
is the last thing this department needs
is some bad press that comes

10:51.154 --> 10:53.184
from an FBI serial killer hunt.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.152
No.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.763
The last thing
this department needs

10:55.765 --> 10:57.764
is a serial killer
on the loose.

10:58.798 --> 11:00.029
She's right.

11:00.031 --> 11:01.269
And you know it.

11:01.271 --> 11:02.605
You know what, Dad?

11:02.607 --> 11:04.006
What?

11:04.008 --> 11:05.501
What?! Come on,
come on, speak up.

11:05.503 --> 11:07.037
You're retired.
Hey.

11:07.039 --> 11:08.277
He's--he's retired.

11:08.279 --> 11:09.942
Ok? And why are you
sticking your nose

11:09.944 --> 11:11.213
where it doesn't belong?

11:11.215 --> 11:13.149
Because I am your father

11:13.151 --> 11:15.748
and I will stick my nose
wherever I damn well please

11:15.750 --> 11:18.454
until the day I die,
and given my age,

11:18.456 --> 11:19.821
that day ain't too far off.

11:19.823 --> 11:21.421
Dad...
What? I'm old.

11:21.623 --> 11:23.252
But I'll make you a deal.

11:23.254 --> 11:26.460
You two both start acting
like you're related

11:26.462 --> 11:29.325
and I'll butt out.

11:29.327 --> 11:31.198
The only way you're
gonna catch this guy

11:31.200 --> 11:33.227
is if you do it together.

11:39.036 --> 11:40.475
No, just a little caffeine.

11:40.477 --> 11:42.770
Other than that,
his tox screen was negative.

11:42.772 --> 11:44.137
That pretty heavy
bruising around his neck.

11:44.139 --> 11:46.178
Yeah. Cause of death
was asphyxiation.

11:46.180 --> 11:49.043
And you see this odd
little cervical fracture right here?

11:49.045 --> 11:51.217
It looks like he got put
in some kind of choke hold.

11:51.219 --> 11:52.512
Choking someone out
is hard enough,

11:52.514 --> 11:53.849
but to break their
neck while you do it?

11:53.851 --> 11:56.451
Yeah, well, he was a strong
son of a bitch.

11:56.453 --> 11:59.658
4 ribs were broken,
radius in his left arm was shattered,

11:59.660 --> 12:02.061
linear fracture
in his skull, broken jaw,

12:02.063 --> 12:03.766
and a ruptured spleen.

12:03.768 --> 12:05.502
Can you tell
if he used a weapon?

12:05.504 --> 12:07.334
I don't think he did.
See this bruising right here?

12:07.336 --> 12:09.472
It looks like he used
his bare hands,

12:09.474 --> 12:10.775
maybe his boots.

12:10.777 --> 12:12.742
But he was suffocated
fairly quickly.

12:12.744 --> 12:14.111
Most of this
is postmortem.

12:14.113 --> 12:15.648
This guy had to be
on something.

12:15.650 --> 12:17.145
Why do you say that?

12:17.147 --> 12:18.449
Because he went berserk.

12:18.451 --> 12:19.952
This is more
than just rage.

12:19.954 --> 12:21.582
Was there any evidence
of sexual assault?

12:21.584 --> 12:22.749
None.

12:24.623 --> 12:27.289
It wasn't like this with Tommy Barnes
or Melissa Hawthorne.

12:27.291 --> 12:29.665
Those two high school kids
who were killed.

12:29.667 --> 12:33.297
The report says that they didn't have
any postmortem wounds.

12:33.299 --> 12:35.233
God, you think
it's the same guy?

12:38.606 --> 12:40.479
Do we have to go through
this again?

12:40.481 --> 12:41.983
Isn't it all
in your report?

12:41.985 --> 12:43.448
I apologize, Mr. Barnes.

12:43.450 --> 12:45.121
I know this is hard.

12:45.123 --> 12:46.490
We're just trying
to be thorough

12:46.492 --> 12:49.091
so we can catch whoever
did this to your son.

12:49.093 --> 12:50.923
All my answers are the same
they were a year ago.

12:50.925 --> 12:54.134
But since you were the one
that actually found Tommy and Melissa,

12:54.136 --> 12:55.766
it's especially important

12:55.768 --> 12:58.804
that we go through
it all again.

12:58.806 --> 13:00.805
Ok?

13:02.375 --> 13:04.077
You were telling me
about that night.

13:04.079 --> 13:07.478
It was late and you
were getting worried.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.615
And then I remembered
that Tommy

13:09.617 --> 13:13.485
put that "find your friends"
app on my phone.

13:13.487 --> 13:16.220
So...

13:19.158 --> 13:20.789
And a couple hours later

13:20.791 --> 13:24.165
I found him and Melissa
in the alley.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.299
Did Tommy have
any enemies,

13:30.301 --> 13:32.834
someone that might
want to hurt him?

13:32.836 --> 13:35.109
No, he was a good kid.
I said that already.

13:35.111 --> 13:37.573
All right, listen. We want to thank you
for coming in, Mr. Barnes.

13:37.574 --> 13:39.561
We appreciate it. If we
have any other questions,

13:39.586 --> 13:40.710
we'll give you a call.

13:40.711 --> 13:43.521
Actually...will you
give us a second?

13:43.523 --> 13:45.826
I just have a few more questions.
Won't take long.

13:45.828 --> 13:47.490
Scott.

13:47.492 --> 13:49.721
Excuse us.

13:54.896 --> 13:57.169
He's holding something back.

13:57.171 --> 13:58.537
He's grieving
the loss of his son.

13:58.539 --> 14:01.204
Exactly. And he's been
trying to get out of here

14:01.206 --> 14:02.541
ever since he sat down.

14:02.543 --> 14:04.510
Can you blame him?

14:04.512 --> 14:06.015
If I had a kid
who was killed

14:06.017 --> 14:08.781
and the FBI wanted
to help find the guy who did it,

14:08.783 --> 14:11.685
I would do whatever
they asked me to.

14:11.687 --> 14:13.484
Look at his posture.

14:14.485 --> 14:16.891
He's too agitated.

14:16.893 --> 14:20.998
There is something odd
about his syntax I can't...

14:21.000 --> 14:22.598
that I can't explain.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.816
And why is that?

14:23.841 --> 14:25.684
Because that profile's
too complicated for me?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.166
Really?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.541
Really?

14:30.543 --> 14:32.068
Right now?

14:33.509 --> 14:35.676
Please, Scott,

14:35.678 --> 14:36.844
for once,

14:36.846 --> 14:38.910
just go with me here.

14:47.794 --> 14:52.196
Mr. Barnes, I am so sorry
to have to ask you this,

14:52.198 --> 14:54.400
but I don't want
to waste your time.

14:54.402 --> 14:56.369
All I want to do
is catch the killer,

14:56.371 --> 14:58.371
but I can't do that
unless you're straight with me.

14:58.372 --> 14:59.706
Alex.

14:59.708 --> 15:01.043
When you found Tommy
and Melissa,

15:01.045 --> 15:03.107
were they clothed?

15:03.109 --> 15:04.642
I don't know
what you mean.

15:04.644 --> 15:08.284
I mean, was Tommy
in girls underwear?

15:09.453 --> 15:12.787
If you want to honor
your son's memory,

15:12.789 --> 15:18.193
maybe bring some peace
to the relatives of the other victims...

15:18.195 --> 15:19.922
Then, please,

15:19.924 --> 15:22.829
just tell me the truth.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.970
I couldn't--I couldn't...

15:32.278 --> 15:36.378
No, it's all right.
We only want to help.

15:45.221 --> 15:47.386
When I found them...

15:50.628 --> 15:53.492
She was naked, and Tom...

15:53.494 --> 15:57.903
Tommy, he was in girls
panties,

15:57.905 --> 16:02.143
and I just...

16:02.145 --> 16:05.251
couldn't let them
see him like that, so...

16:08.348 --> 16:11.818
I took them off and...

16:11.820 --> 16:14.553
I put them on Melissa
and I...

16:14.555 --> 16:17.193
I put all their clothes
back on. I'm so sorry.

16:17.195 --> 16:18.657
No, it's all right.

16:54.559 --> 16:56.193
We ready?

16:56.195 --> 16:58.463
Just waiting on you, Hon.

17:01.797 --> 17:02.964
What was that?

17:02.966 --> 17:04.766
Did you let Rufus out?

17:04.768 --> 17:05.902
I thought you did.

17:05.904 --> 17:07.902
Tsk. Oh...

17:13.383 --> 17:15.047
Rufus?

17:19.457 --> 17:21.089
Oh, Rufus.

17:23.762 --> 17:25.332
Everything ok?

17:25.334 --> 17:27.964
Yeah. This dumb cat.

17:31.239 --> 17:32.837
Hey!

17:52.069 --> 17:54.510
Gil and Renee Patterson
were good, hard-working people.

17:54.512 --> 17:56.448
He was a bank manager,
she was a nurse.

17:56.450 --> 17:59.710
If all these victims were targets,
then what's the connection?

17:59.712 --> 18:02.684
Maybe they're not targets.
Maybe they're surrogates.

18:02.686 --> 18:04.550
For who?

18:04.552 --> 18:07.019
So, um, apparently,
a neighbor found the bodies

18:07.021 --> 18:09.186
when she came by and saw
the door was ajar.

18:09.188 --> 18:10.855
Do the Pattersons have
any next of kin?

18:10.857 --> 18:12.254
We're gonna need
to talk to them.

18:12.256 --> 18:14.318
Yeah, they do. They have a daughter
named Laurie.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.955
She's a senior at
the University of Missouri.

18:21.689 --> 18:24.125
M.O.'s the exact same.

18:24.127 --> 18:26.523
Women's underwear,
violent manual overkill.

18:26.525 --> 18:28.023
It's definitely our guy.

18:28.025 --> 18:29.517
And now he's accelerating.

18:29.519 --> 18:30.756
And he's getting bolder.

18:30.758 --> 18:31.884
He's never broken
into a home before.

18:36.860 --> 18:39.121
Hey, what you got, mama?

18:39.123 --> 18:42.694
So it turns out our dead
jogger David Morrison

18:42.696 --> 18:45.525
bounced around as
a substitute English teacher

18:45.527 --> 18:47.094
before he published
his first book.

18:47.096 --> 18:50.367
4 years ago, he worked
for a week at Jefferson High School,

18:50.369 --> 18:51.966
and that is the same school

18:51.968 --> 18:54.534
that Tommy Barnes
and Melissa Hawthorne went to.

18:54.536 --> 18:56.973
The Pattersons have a daughter.
Laurie.

18:56.975 --> 18:58.909
Garcia, where did Laurie
Patterson go to high school?

18:58.911 --> 19:01.013
That would be...Jefferson.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.214
And when did she graduate?

19:02.216 --> 19:04.879
Um...

19:04.881 --> 19:07.286
4 years ago.

19:07.288 --> 19:09.718
So she was there
at the same time Morrison was.

19:09.720 --> 19:13.557
All right, I'll call Hotch.
We need to give the profile.

19:13.559 --> 19:15.636
Based on his victims and
on local demographics,

19:15.637 --> 19:17.373
we believe we're looking
for a Caucasian male

19:17.375 --> 19:19.206
in his late teens
to early 20s.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.298
He's a sadist
with rage issues,

19:21.299 --> 19:23.021
which accounts for
the high level of violence

19:23.022 --> 19:24.306
in each of his kills.

19:24.307 --> 19:27.409
All 5 of his victims are in some way
connected to Jefferson high school.

19:27.411 --> 19:28.750
Which leads us to believe

19:28.775 --> 19:30.949
he's either a former
student or employee.

19:31.076 --> 19:32.516
Why former?

19:32.518 --> 19:34.487
Because we also
think he has a drug problem.

19:34.489 --> 19:36.152
The addiction
plus his anger issues

19:36.154 --> 19:37.856
means that he probably
lacks the social skills

19:37.858 --> 19:40.222
required to stay in school
or hold down a steady job.

19:40.224 --> 19:41.622
Because brute force
and humiliation

19:41.624 --> 19:43.126
are the hallmarks
of his M.O.,

19:43.128 --> 19:45.430
we believe his kills are
somehow rooted in revenge.

19:45.432 --> 19:47.828
We think he may have
been traumatically humiliated

19:47.830 --> 19:50.435
in some way
in the recent past.

19:50.437 --> 19:51.636
Probably
as an adolescent,

19:51.638 --> 19:52.973
which makes this
very personal to him.

19:52.975 --> 19:54.902
Now he's
looking for payback.

19:54.904 --> 19:57.109
So why did this guy wait a
whole year after his first murders?

19:57.111 --> 19:59.277
We think he may have
been incarcerated.

19:59.279 --> 20:01.447
So you should be looking
at violent offenders

20:01.449 --> 20:04.151
or any younger ex-cons
you may be familiar with.

20:04.153 --> 20:06.753
We think his first kills
were experiments of sorts.

20:06.755 --> 20:08.322
He was just getting
a taste for it.

20:08.324 --> 20:10.163
Tommy Barnes
and Melissa Hawthorne

20:10.165 --> 20:12.658
had more defensive wounds
than any of his other victims.

20:12.660 --> 20:14.360
And they apparently
put up quite a fight.

20:14.362 --> 20:16.894
It's not easy to blitz attack
two people at once.

20:16.896 --> 20:18.691
So whether he was
locked up or not, he probably took

20:18.693 --> 20:20.628
a year off to perfect
his craft to make sure

20:20.653 --> 20:22.164
that never happened again.

20:22.165 --> 20:24.529
He's physically fit
and probably works out a lot,

20:24.531 --> 20:28.435
so he may frequent
inexpensive gyms or heath clubs.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.477
And don't forget,
this guy used his bare hands

20:30.479 --> 20:31.943
to kill his victims.

20:31.945 --> 20:33.413
He will not be easily
deterred.

20:33.415 --> 20:34.772
So proceed with caution.

20:35.184 --> 20:37.171
As his grip on reality
continues to fade,

20:37.201 --> 20:38.967
he'll become more dangerous.

20:43.907 --> 20:46.113
Hey, wrap it up, kid.
We're closing.

20:46.115 --> 20:47.843
Few more minutes.
Two more rounds.

20:47.845 --> 20:49.714
Hey, get the hell out.
I gotta get going.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.083
Ah!

20:51.085 --> 20:53.355
I just need
a few more minutes!

20:53.357 --> 20:54.819
Ok?

20:54.821 --> 20:55.923
All right by you?

20:55.925 --> 20:57.627
It's all good, man.
No problem.

20:57.629 --> 20:59.395
I don't want any trouble.

21:01.931 --> 21:04.362
We should cross-check our list
of recently released ex-cons again.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.594
Garcia and I have
been over it twice.

21:05.596 --> 21:07.897
Nobody matches the profile.

21:08.899 --> 21:11.033
Hey, baby girl, you got
the whole crew. Go ahead.

21:11.035 --> 21:12.671
Ok, here's the skinny
on Jefferson High.

21:12.673 --> 21:14.733
Really great football team,
state champ two years in a row,

21:14.735 --> 21:16.132
go, Bulldogs.

21:16.134 --> 21:18.969
The only notable thing that
has happened at that high school

21:18.971 --> 21:20.503
in the last 10 years
besides the murder

21:20.505 --> 21:22.334
of Tommy Barnes
and Melissa Hawthorne

21:22.336 --> 21:24.669
is the death
of another student,

21:24.671 --> 21:26.342
Riley Wilson, 4 years ago.

21:26.344 --> 21:27.911
Sending.

21:27.913 --> 21:30.941
Information streaming
to your tablets now.

21:31.908 --> 21:35.042
He wrapped his car
around a telephone pole.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.378
Yeah. There was a lot
of speculation it was a suicide.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.187
Tox report was clean.

21:39.189 --> 21:40.555
He was totally sober.

21:40.557 --> 21:42.390
He was a senior
and got straight As.

21:42.392 --> 21:44.620
Nothing in his
disciplinary file.

21:44.622 --> 21:47.522
He was at Jefferson the same time
as David Morrison and Laurie Patterson.

21:47.524 --> 21:49.256
Garcia, we need a list
of every student and employee

21:49.258 --> 21:51.393
at Jefferson while Riley
Wilson was a student.

21:51.395 --> 21:53.292
Parents and family members,
too, Garcia.

21:53.294 --> 21:55.091
Compiling that list now.

21:55.093 --> 21:58.058
It is a lot of names.
I will hit you back ASAP.

21:59.859 --> 22:02.266
Here's a partial list
of former students

22:02.268 --> 22:04.567
who still live
in the city.

22:06.031 --> 22:07.599
Why partial?

22:07.601 --> 22:10.366
We've narrowed it down
so we can split the work.

22:10.368 --> 22:12.437
We'll cover the rest.

22:13.572 --> 22:15.941
Ok. We'll get on it.

22:17.311 --> 22:19.509
And, uh, one of those people
may be the unsub,

22:19.511 --> 22:21.878
so, make sure
your guys know.

22:22.879 --> 22:24.948
You got it.

22:27.382 --> 22:30.355
Ok.

22:32.587 --> 22:34.899
Uh, you know...

22:36.827 --> 22:38.362
I never would have
shown up like I did

22:38.364 --> 22:39.859
if dad
hadn't asked me to.

22:39.861 --> 22:42.026
I mean, I get it.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.632
You have every right
to be upset.

22:44.634 --> 22:47.368
It's all good, Alex. Ok?

22:47.370 --> 22:49.000
Come on. I haven't
seen you in years

22:49.002 --> 22:52.336
and now we get this great chance
to work together.

22:53.976 --> 22:56.806
I better get started.

23:50.404 --> 23:51.738
Charles Gates?

23:51.740 --> 23:52.737
Yeah.

23:52.739 --> 23:54.065
Detective Miller.

23:54.067 --> 23:55.537
Kansas City police department.

23:55.539 --> 23:57.410
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions.

23:57.412 --> 23:59.877
Um...sure.

23:59.879 --> 24:01.550
May I come in?

24:02.583 --> 24:03.813
Yeah, of course.

24:03.815 --> 24:07.019
Um, sorry about the mess.
No problem.

24:09.155 --> 24:12.754
Laurie, we're so very
sorry about your parents.

24:12.756 --> 24:14.993
Thank you
for coming in.

24:14.995 --> 24:18.191
We know this--
this is a lot.

24:18.193 --> 24:19.494
It's ok, I, uh,

24:19.496 --> 24:22.291
don't really want
to go home yet.

24:22.293 --> 24:25.994
Is there anything
we can get you?

24:27.162 --> 24:30.599
Is it ok if we ask
you a few questions?

24:34.972 --> 24:35.997
Is there anyone you know

24:36.022 --> 24:38.049
who may have wanted
to hurt your parents?

24:40.937 --> 24:42.832
No.

24:42.834 --> 24:46.366
Is there anyone who may
have wanted to hurt you?

24:46.368 --> 24:48.343
No, I--

24:48.345 --> 24:50.440
oh, my God.

24:50.442 --> 24:52.945
I'm--I'm so sorry.

24:55.019 --> 24:56.250
It's ok.

24:56.252 --> 24:57.954
We're gonna give you
a minute. Ok?

24:57.956 --> 24:59.554
Thank you.

25:04.528 --> 25:07.167
I couldn't believe it
when I heard he was dead.

25:07.169 --> 25:08.934
I mean, Riley
didn't even drink.

25:08.936 --> 25:10.406
And I'd just seen him
at school.

25:10.408 --> 25:12.375
So you two
were pretty close.

25:12.377 --> 25:13.440
Yeah.

25:13.442 --> 25:15.943
I mean, he wasn't
all that social.

25:15.945 --> 25:17.775
He kept
to himself a lot.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.846
So he was
kind of a loner.

25:19.848 --> 25:21.015
Yeah.

25:21.017 --> 25:23.919
But we hung out.
We had a few classes together.

25:23.921 --> 25:25.151
Liar!

25:50.014 --> 25:51.782
Dad!

25:51.784 --> 25:53.086
Is he ok? What happened?

25:53.088 --> 25:55.360
He got beat up pretty bad.
Took a blow to the head.

25:55.362 --> 25:57.457
Did he have backup?
Where's his partner?

25:57.459 --> 25:58.529
He came alone.

25:58.554 --> 26:00.647
They split up the list
to cover more ground.

26:00.763 --> 26:01.928
Let's get him
to the hospital.

26:01.930 --> 26:03.199
All right,
I'm coming with you.

26:03.201 --> 26:05.101
No, you stay here.
You'll do more good.

26:05.103 --> 26:07.467
Don't worry. I'll--
I'll take care of him.

26:27.770 --> 26:31.102
The unsub was probably already here
when your brother arrived.

26:31.104 --> 26:32.134
But he didn't kill him.

26:32.136 --> 26:33.797
Because Charles
was the target.

26:33.799 --> 26:35.404
So this guy's
mission oriented.

26:35.406 --> 26:37.702
I believe the unsub
may have stolen Scott's firearm.

26:37.704 --> 26:39.671
Doesn't match his M.O.,

26:39.696 --> 26:41.713
but that won't stop him
from using it.

26:41.849 --> 26:44.383
There's something in here.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.519
He wrote, "Charles
and Riley good friends,"

26:46.521 --> 26:50.287
but he underlined the words
"good" and "friends."

26:50.289 --> 26:51.623
That mean something
to you?

26:51.625 --> 26:53.318
Yeah. He used to do that
when we were kids.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.324
Usually when something
really irritated him.

26:56.326 --> 26:59.397
He underlined words
when he was irritated?

26:59.399 --> 27:02.533
Yeah. Our mother used to
make us write letters

27:02.535 --> 27:04.798
to each other to help us
resolve our conflicts.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.238
She thought it was
a good way to learn

27:06.240 --> 27:07.606
how to express
our feelings.

27:07.608 --> 27:09.034
Smart lady.

27:09.036 --> 27:13.241
What was it about the words
"good friends" that got to him?

27:17.612 --> 27:20.009
Hey, Dad, how's he doing?

27:21.747 --> 27:23.082
Hi, Laurie.

27:23.084 --> 27:25.914
How are you doing?

27:25.916 --> 27:28.616
I'm afraid I have
some more bad news.

27:28.618 --> 27:30.385
The killer struck again.

27:30.387 --> 27:33.889
This time it was
a former classmate of yours--

27:33.891 --> 27:34.960
Charles Gates.

27:36.098 --> 27:38.393
I understand this is
incredibly overwhelming,

27:38.395 --> 27:40.669
but we really need your help.

27:40.671 --> 27:43.574
Ok? I want to ask you
about Charles

27:43.576 --> 27:46.807
and another former
classmate of yours, Riley Wilson.

27:46.809 --> 27:48.912
What about them?

27:48.914 --> 27:51.782
Were they good friends?

27:54.015 --> 27:56.992
Charles and Riley? No.

27:56.994 --> 27:59.423
Riley didn't really
have any friends.

27:59.425 --> 28:01.425
Why not?

28:01.427 --> 28:04.268
He was a gigantic nerd

28:04.270 --> 28:06.604
and a total victim.

28:06.606 --> 28:08.606
What do you mean?

28:10.441 --> 28:12.048
They used to bully him,

28:12.050 --> 28:13.784
like all the time.

28:13.786 --> 28:16.282
What would they do to him?

28:16.284 --> 28:18.892
Tease him. Beat him up.

28:19.893 --> 28:21.037
And then--

28:21.062 --> 28:23.078
and then there was
the underwear thing.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.702
What underwear thing?

28:27.903 --> 28:29.905
Some guys thought
it'd be funny

28:29.907 --> 28:33.776
if they stole all Riley's clothes
in gym class.

28:35.377 --> 28:37.578
Hey, here he is.

28:44.462 --> 28:46.691
They made him wear
a pair of panties.

28:46.693 --> 28:49.693
And then they sent out
a mass text

28:49.695 --> 28:53.839
to everyone in school
telling them to line the hallways.

28:53.841 --> 28:55.903
Basically the whole school
showed up.

28:55.905 --> 28:59.913
Whose idea was it
to pull the prank?

29:01.452 --> 29:05.114
My ex-boyfriend,
Lance Tate.

29:06.452 --> 29:08.322
He was a jerk.

29:10.987 --> 29:12.427
Where were the teachers?

29:14.735 --> 29:18.840
Mr. Ramsey and some substitute
broke it up.

29:20.505 --> 29:22.378
Go back to class.

29:22.380 --> 29:23.982
Everybody back to class!

29:25.152 --> 29:27.322
Show's over.

29:29.491 --> 29:30.924
Did anything happen to him?

29:30.926 --> 29:33.163
Did Lance get in trouble?

29:33.165 --> 29:34.667
No.

29:34.669 --> 29:35.401
Were there any other kids

29:35.426 --> 29:37.232
that were bullied
or was Riley the only one?

29:38.301 --> 29:40.300
Yeah, there were others.

29:40.302 --> 29:41.939
Do you remember
their names?

29:41.941 --> 29:46.044
Wait. Is that--
is that what this is about?

29:46.046 --> 29:49.379
Is that why
my parents were killed?

29:49.381 --> 29:51.612
Oh, my God.

29:51.614 --> 29:53.485
Laurie Patterson
was away at school,

29:53.487 --> 29:55.817
so he couldn't
go after her.

29:55.819 --> 29:57.249
So he goes after
her parents instead.

29:57.251 --> 29:59.488
That was his way
of maximizing her suffering.

29:59.490 --> 30:01.488
Laurie's ex,
Sergeant Lance Tate,

30:01.490 --> 30:02.919
is doing his third tour
in Afghanistan.

30:02.921 --> 30:05.054
His parents moved to Arizona.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.294
Hey. You're on speaker,
Garcia.

30:08.296 --> 30:11.492
Hot off my keyboard,
I took the names Laurie gave us

30:11.494 --> 30:14.668
and I cross-checked them
with Riley Wilson's texts,

30:14.670 --> 30:18.329
emails, and social media.
I got two hits.

30:18.331 --> 30:21.264
One's a Kevin Russ.
That was his chemistry lab partner.

30:21.266 --> 30:23.167
And the second
and the way more interesting

30:23.169 --> 30:25.932
is a kid named
Ronald Underwood.

30:25.934 --> 30:27.836
What's so interesting
about him?

30:27.838 --> 30:30.310
It looks like they were
actually pretty good friends.

30:30.312 --> 30:33.578
Ronald dropped of school
right after Riley died.

30:33.580 --> 30:34.914
What else do we know
about Underwood?

30:34.916 --> 30:37.384
Uh, dad is out of the picture.
He lives with his mom,

30:37.386 --> 30:40.688
who has 4, 4 DUIs.

30:40.690 --> 30:43.685
He spends a cra-cra-crazy
amount of time on the Internet,

30:43.687 --> 30:46.651
mostly looking at porn
and MMA sites and--

30:46.653 --> 30:49.658
Oh. The Internet is also where
he buys his anabolic steroids.

30:49.660 --> 30:52.962
If this is all about bullying, the unsub
may have been a victim himself.

30:52.964 --> 30:54.963
He may also feel responsible for
what happened to Riley.

30:54.965 --> 30:57.865
And he's targeting the bullies and
the adults who did nothing to stop it.

30:57.867 --> 31:00.167
Laurie said a substitute
teacher and a Mr. Ramsey

31:00.169 --> 31:02.168
were there the day
of the practical joke.

31:02.170 --> 31:03.567
David Morrison
had to be the sub.

31:03.569 --> 31:05.397
Garcia,
where's Mr. Ramsey now?

31:05.399 --> 31:07.534
Harold Ramsey, history teacher.

31:07.536 --> 31:08.870
He still works
at Jefferson high.

31:08.872 --> 31:10.637
All right, send contact
numbers and addresses

31:10.639 --> 31:12.939
for both Harold Ramsey
and Ronald Underwood.

31:12.941 --> 31:14.411
Sent and sent.

31:14.413 --> 31:16.042
Thanks.

31:36.365 --> 31:37.531
Hello?

31:37.533 --> 31:40.232
Yes, is this Harold Ramsey?

31:40.234 --> 31:42.096
Yes, speaking.

31:42.098 --> 31:45.070
Hello, Mr. Ramsey.
This is SSA Alex Blake.

31:45.072 --> 31:46.405
I'm with the FBI.

31:46.407 --> 31:47.405
FBI?

31:50.274 --> 31:51.883
Mr. Ramsey?

31:51.885 --> 31:53.146
Aah!

31:53.148 --> 31:55.313
Mr. Ramsey.

32:04.692 --> 32:06.361
Stop.
Uhh!

32:11.232 --> 32:14.200
How does it feel?

32:14.202 --> 32:15.704
Why are you doing this?

32:15.706 --> 32:18.010
I just wish they were
all here to see it.

32:18.012 --> 32:19.212
Please--

32:19.214 --> 32:21.547
Maybe we should shake hands
and forget about it.

32:21.549 --> 32:23.410
That's what you'd say,
right?

32:24.582 --> 32:26.481
What are you talking about?

32:26.483 --> 32:27.513
Riley!

32:43.643 --> 32:45.578
You, too!
Get to class.

32:45.580 --> 32:47.874
Everybody back to class.

32:47.876 --> 32:49.881
Show's over!

32:53.785 --> 32:55.319
Aah!

32:55.321 --> 32:57.920
You knew what
they did to us.

33:04.731 --> 33:06.992
And you did nothing.

33:06.994 --> 33:09.802
And you wanted me
to shake their hands?

33:12.541 --> 33:14.341
Shake their hands?!

33:14.343 --> 33:17.246
Did you actually think
that would solve anything?

33:17.248 --> 33:18.878
We believe Underwood
is in possession

33:18.880 --> 33:21.047
of a stolen police issue
Glock 19.

33:21.049 --> 33:22.689
We'll split up
into 3 groups,

33:22.691 --> 33:25.058
we'll go room to room, and we'll
all meet back in the main hallway.

33:25.060 --> 33:26.890
Because we're back where
it all started with Underwood,

33:26.892 --> 33:28.727
this is likely his endgame.

33:28.729 --> 33:30.222
Which means there's
no telling how far

33:30.224 --> 33:32.094
he'll go to play this
thing out, so be safe.

33:39.442 --> 33:40.610
Uhh!

33:40.612 --> 33:42.941
Go.

33:42.943 --> 33:44.612
I said go!

33:44.614 --> 33:46.083
Ronald, please.

33:46.085 --> 33:48.114
I'm surprised
you remember my name.

33:48.116 --> 33:50.515
Just stop this.

33:50.517 --> 33:52.315
Oh!

33:52.317 --> 33:54.552
Get up.

33:55.456 --> 33:56.623
Get up!

34:14.339 --> 34:16.409
Go.

34:16.411 --> 34:17.746
Move!

34:19.748 --> 34:22.315
Ronald Underwood, FBI.
Drop the weapon.

34:22.317 --> 34:23.955
Let him go, Ronald.

34:23.956 --> 34:25.788
He has to know
how it felt.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.420
I think he does.

34:27.422 --> 34:29.830
Look at him.

34:29.831 --> 34:31.663
Let him go.

34:31.665 --> 34:33.297
He should have stopped it.

34:33.299 --> 34:35.770
I know why you're
doing this, Ronald.

34:35.772 --> 34:39.375
What happened to Riley
wasn't your fault.

34:41.648 --> 34:44.117
Nobody stopped it.

34:44.119 --> 34:46.855
Nobody did anything.

34:46.857 --> 34:47.889
You did.

34:47.891 --> 34:49.152
You're damn right.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.760
And they got
what they deserved.

34:50.762 --> 34:53.791
But nobody else
needs to die.

34:53.793 --> 34:56.862
You've got to leave
the past in the past.

34:59.096 --> 35:02.104
He was the only friend
I ever had.

35:02.106 --> 35:04.211
I know he was.

35:04.213 --> 35:06.910
But it's all over now,
Ronald.

35:19.864 --> 35:21.997
Hey, man, it's ok,
you don't have to cuff me.

35:21.999 --> 35:23.630
I said you
don't have to cuff me!

35:23.632 --> 35:24.766
Get off of me!

35:24.768 --> 35:26.306
I said get off!

35:26.308 --> 35:28.339
They're too tight!
Get off of me!

35:28.341 --> 35:29.474
I said get off!

35:29.476 --> 35:31.412
I said get off!

35:31.414 --> 35:33.076
Stop! Get off of me!

35:33.078 --> 35:35.949
Come on. Get off of me!

35:43.823 --> 35:45.861
How's the wing?

35:45.863 --> 35:47.967
Throbbing.

35:50.139 --> 35:51.833
You all good?

35:53.769 --> 35:57.748
Jefferson
was my rival high school.

35:57.750 --> 36:01.319
Got dragged to a few
football games here back in the day.

36:01.321 --> 36:03.918
It must bring back
some memories.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.022
Oh, yeah.

36:05.024 --> 36:07.560
Bad ones.

36:07.562 --> 36:09.498
How's your brother doing?

36:09.500 --> 36:11.837
Concussion.

36:11.839 --> 36:14.772
But he's awake and...

36:14.774 --> 36:16.637
He's gonna do fine.

36:16.639 --> 36:18.246
Thank God.

36:18.248 --> 36:20.215
Good.

36:20.217 --> 36:23.420
Do you want a ride
over there?

36:25.622 --> 36:28.764
Nah. It's the hospital
where my mom died

36:28.766 --> 36:30.730
and my big brother Danny, too.

36:30.732 --> 36:32.655
So...

36:33.592 --> 36:37.033
not exactly raring
to get back there.

36:53.656 --> 36:54.726
How's the headache?

36:56.732 --> 36:59.830
Well, the medicine’s helping.

36:59.832 --> 37:02.198
You got lucky.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.568
You shouldn't have
gone in without backup.

37:04.570 --> 37:07.734
Ironic that your hard head
is what saved you.

37:07.736 --> 37:11.237
You really scared me,
you know.

37:14.408 --> 37:17.615
I guess congratulations
is in order.

37:17.617 --> 37:18.783
Mm-hmm. For all of us.

37:18.785 --> 37:20.583
We did it together.

37:23.585 --> 37:25.593
So dad was right, then.

37:25.595 --> 37:28.731
I hate that.

37:28.733 --> 37:30.630
Yeah, me, too.

37:35.471 --> 37:38.479
Listen, um...

37:38.481 --> 37:40.543
Listen, I'm really sorry, ok?

37:40.545 --> 37:44.153
I'm sorry for being an ass.
You didn't deserve that.

37:44.155 --> 37:46.726
No, I didn't.

37:46.728 --> 37:48.990
And I don't know why
you made me so mad.

37:48.992 --> 37:51.093
Because I'm your sister.

37:51.095 --> 37:55.105
It's--it's normal for siblings
to resent each other.

37:55.107 --> 37:57.402
Ok, what is that?

37:57.404 --> 37:59.137
What, is that
your profile of me?

37:59.139 --> 38:00.641
Resent?

38:00.643 --> 38:03.439
Look, I don't resent you,
Alex.

38:03.441 --> 38:05.311
I miss you.

38:07.313 --> 38:11.553
You sure have a funny way
of showing it.

38:12.754 --> 38:16.055
You know, after Danny died,
you just left.

38:16.057 --> 38:17.680
And then with mom,
it's like you just stopped

38:17.705 --> 38:19.166
coming around altogether.

38:19.995 --> 38:23.064
It's like here you are,
my big sister, and you just bailed.

38:23.066 --> 38:25.097
I couldn't stay here, Scott.

38:25.099 --> 38:27.771
I know. You know what?
Trust me, I get it, I figured it out.

38:27.773 --> 38:28.938
But the funny thing is,

38:28.940 --> 38:32.339
here you are
this hot-shot linguist...

38:32.341 --> 38:34.809
And you can never
say anything.

38:34.811 --> 38:37.175
You never call,
you never write,

38:37.177 --> 38:39.681
nothing.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.788
What's wrong?
You all right?

38:43.790 --> 38:46.725
Oh, yeah. It's just
my arm. I got shot.

38:46.727 --> 38:48.295
Ok, what?
See, right there.

38:48.297 --> 38:50.065
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

38:50.067 --> 38:51.801
It's nothing.

38:51.803 --> 38:53.232
I'm fine.

38:53.234 --> 38:55.676
Oh, really? Does dad know?

38:55.678 --> 38:57.014
No.

38:57.016 --> 38:59.508
Of course not. Why would he?

39:04.282 --> 39:05.615
But you're right.

39:05.617 --> 39:07.784
I'm sorry.

39:09.249 --> 39:11.887
I'm bad
about being in touch.

39:11.889 --> 39:14.054
And coming home,

39:14.056 --> 39:16.393
it's really hard for me.

39:16.395 --> 39:18.131
I see you
and I think of Danny.

39:18.133 --> 39:20.166
I see dad and...

39:20.168 --> 39:22.470
I think of mom.

39:24.541 --> 39:28.771
But I'll work on it.

39:28.773 --> 39:32.042
I promise.

39:34.885 --> 39:37.319
And I miss you, too.

39:53.734 --> 39:54.733
Hello?

39:54.734 --> 39:55.733
Oh...

39:55.735 --> 39:57.773
You're late.

39:57.775 --> 39:59.539
Like...

39:59.541 --> 40:01.242
What--
5 minutes.

40:01.244 --> 40:03.179
You're still late.

40:03.181 --> 40:05.309
Hey, pop.
How's the melon?

40:05.311 --> 40:07.884
It's, uh, it's
all right. It's fine.

40:08.717 --> 40:11.588
Ahh, you two made up,
didn't you?

40:11.590 --> 40:12.669
Yeah, I figured--

40:12.694 --> 40:14.694
heh heh--been doing that
since you were kids.

40:15.390 --> 40:18.789
Fight like cats and dogs,
then forget about it 10 minutes later.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.493
Used to drive
your mother crazy.

40:20.495 --> 40:22.594
Then she'd drive me crazy.

40:22.596 --> 40:23.963
Hey, pop, you know
she got shot?

40:23.965 --> 40:25.668
Oh, that's great.

40:25.670 --> 40:26.868
Well...

40:26.870 --> 40:28.931
Yeah, I heard.

40:28.933 --> 40:29.939
You heard?

40:29.941 --> 40:32.005
Mr. Miller?

40:32.007 --> 40:33.308
We need more ice.

40:33.310 --> 40:35.475
Hey, what's up?
Help yourself.

40:36.646 --> 40:38.679
You must be Scott.
I'm Penelope.

40:38.681 --> 40:40.519
Hi.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.056
What are you doing here?

40:42.058 --> 40:43.552
I invited them.

40:43.554 --> 40:44.590
Yeah.

40:44.592 --> 40:46.317
It's only a 2 1/2 hour
flight.

40:46.319 --> 40:47.990
When I hear Kansas City barbecue
I come a-runnin',

40:47.992 --> 40:52.496
for the sides and the fixin's.
I'm a vegetarian.

40:55.032 --> 40:57.471
What do you mean,
them?

40:58.568 --> 41:03.745
Oh, you're all here.

41:03.747 --> 41:06.210
My worlds are colliding.

41:06.212 --> 41:08.948
And your dad
promised ribs.

41:08.950 --> 41:10.851
And your pops
is no joke on this grill.

41:10.853 --> 41:13.016
Can't celebrate unless
the whole family's here.

41:13.018 --> 41:15.922
I can't argue
with that.

41:15.924 --> 41:17.693
And who needs a cold one?

41:17.695 --> 41:18.998
Don't mind if I do.
Cheers.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.295
To Blake.
To Blake.

41:20.297 --> 41:23.499
"Alone
we can do so little.

41:23.501 --> 41:25.530
Together we can do so much."
