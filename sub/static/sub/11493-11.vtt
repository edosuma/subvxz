Two and a Half Men...

00:02.111 --> 00:03.878
Excuse me, do you know
the difference

00:03.903 --> 00:06.353
between "organic beef"
and "grass-fed beef"?

00:07.040 --> 00:08.239
She was totally hitting on you.

00:08.325 --> 00:09.909
You should ask her out.

00:10.058 --> 00:12.809
Hey, Zoey, you want
to on a date with me?!

00:12.811 --> 00:14.261
Sure!

00:14.263 --> 00:16.880
When I was in high school,
I met this girl named Bridget.

00:16.882 --> 00:18.915
You're still in love
with her, aren't you?

00:18.917 --> 00:20.383
See, look. No wedding ring.

00:20.385 --> 00:22.586
Hmm, I noticed
the bright white tan line.

00:22.588 --> 00:24.387
No worries. I gave it to Alan.

00:24.389 --> 00:27.224
Oh... very valuable.

00:27.226 --> 00:28.842
(chuckles)

00:28.844 --> 00:30.677
You seem like
a really sweet guy,

00:30.679 --> 00:34.514
but I think you're still kind
of married to your Bridget.

00:34.516 --> 00:37.651
Face it, you're not ready
to be dating yet.

00:38.769 --> 00:40.970
You want your ring back?

00:40.972 --> 00:42.072
Yeah.

00:42.074 --> 00:43.640
I don't need this anymore.

00:43.642 --> 00:44.908
You sure?

00:44.910 --> 00:47.244
I'm positive.

00:48.312 --> 00:50.614
My precious! My precious!

00:53.501 --> 00:56.152
My precious! My precious!

00:58.289 --> 01:00.624
My precious!

01:05.212 --> 01:07.180
Mind if I take this?

01:07.182 --> 01:09.132
Oh, uh, no--
somebody's sitting there.

01:09.134 --> 01:11.334
Well, where are they?

01:11.336 --> 01:12.636
They're not here yet.

01:12.638 --> 01:14.938
Well, I'm here
and I need a chair.

01:14.940 --> 01:16.640
No, uh...

01:16.642 --> 01:18.775
honestly, I have a girl coming.

01:18.777 --> 01:21.444
Well, when she gets here,
I'll give it back to her.

01:21.446 --> 01:24.698
See, I don't believe that.

01:27.017 --> 01:29.202
You calling me a liar?

01:29.204 --> 01:33.490
No, but I've been burnt before.

01:33.492 --> 01:36.025
I'm taking this chair.

01:36.027 --> 01:37.544
No, you're not.

01:37.546 --> 01:39.913
Yes, I am. Let go!

01:39.915 --> 01:41.247
You let go
of the chair.

01:41.249 --> 01:42.966
I had the chair before
you even came into the place.

01:42.968 --> 01:44.551
- It's mine now!
- It's my chair now!

01:44.553 --> 01:46.469
Walden, is everything all right?

01:46.471 --> 01:48.488
Ha! She's here.
Now back off!

01:50.257 --> 01:51.558
What was that all about?

01:51.560 --> 01:53.560
It was an attempt
at a chairjacking.

01:53.562 --> 01:56.146
Here, I get you a tea.

01:56.148 --> 01:58.431
Thank you.
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:58.433 --> 02:00.734
I'm trying to get my daughter
into Bellwood Academy.

02:00.736 --> 02:02.485
It's a nightmare.

02:02.487 --> 02:05.188
She tests well, but she did
not give a good interview.

02:05.190 --> 02:06.389
How old is
your daughter again?

02:06.391 --> 02:08.024
Five.

02:08.026 --> 02:11.194
And Bellwood Academy is a...?
Kindergarten.

02:11.196 --> 02:14.414
Wow, when I was five,
I got kicked out of preschool

02:14.416 --> 02:15.532
for biting my teacher.

02:15.534 --> 02:16.866
Why did you bite her?

02:16.868 --> 02:18.752
She tried to steal my chair.

02:20.404 --> 02:22.071
Yeah, you heard me! I bit her!

02:23.507 --> 02:24.907
She had to get a shot!

02:27.011 --> 02:28.678
Take it easy, okay?

02:29.930 --> 02:31.381
So I was rather surprised

02:31.383 --> 02:32.882
to hear from you.
What's up?

02:32.884 --> 02:35.969
I was thinking a lot about what
you said about not wanting

02:35.971 --> 02:39.422
to date me while I was
still, you know,

02:39.424 --> 02:41.090
emotionally attached
to my ex-wife.

02:41.092 --> 02:44.027
I said you were still
hopelessly in love with her.

02:44.029 --> 02:46.730
Potato, Po-tah-to.

02:46.732 --> 02:48.264
The point is you were right.

02:48.266 --> 02:50.483
I wasn't ready to start
dating, but I am now.

02:50.485 --> 02:53.236
A whole week later.

02:53.238 --> 02:55.038
I understand your skepticism.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.907
Which is why I want you to
witness what I'm about to do.

02:57.909 --> 02:59.876
These...

02:59.878 --> 03:02.295
are my final divorce papers.

03:03.414 --> 03:07.384
And once I sign them, my
marriage will be over forever.

03:08.586 --> 03:11.638
I was hoping that you
and I could start fresh.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.674
Nothing like starting off
a new relationship

03:14.676 --> 03:16.459
on the ashes of the old one.

03:16.461 --> 03:18.961
That's what I was thinking.

03:21.799 --> 03:23.316
Oh, uh, you got a pen?

03:23.318 --> 03:25.735
Uh, I don't think I do.

03:25.737 --> 03:26.803
Okay.

03:26.805 --> 03:29.138
Uh, does anybody got a pen
I can borrow?

03:30.157 --> 03:32.141
Anyone? Nobody?

03:32.143 --> 03:33.142
Excuse me.

03:33.144 --> 03:34.077
Do you got a pen?

03:34.079 --> 03:35.144
Sorry.

03:35.146 --> 03:38.114
It's unbelievable.

03:38.116 --> 03:39.783
(clears throat)

03:41.001 --> 03:43.986
Oh, man.

03:43.988 --> 03:46.089
Can I please borrow your pen?

03:46.091 --> 03:49.676
I'm sorry, someone's using it.

03:49.678 --> 03:50.960
Who?

03:50.962 --> 03:53.480
They're not here yet.

03:54.782 --> 03:57.667
I will give you a hundred
dollars to borrow that pen.

04:32.534 --> 04:36.337
(British accent):
Jolly good sunset, eh, what?

04:36.339 --> 04:38.372
Excuse me?

04:38.374 --> 04:39.873
(accent continues):
I like the way you talk,

04:39.875 --> 04:42.709
so I thought
I'd give it a go.

04:42.711 --> 04:45.429
Well, no one says "jolly good"
unless they're appearing in

04:45.431 --> 04:47.214
a revival of <i>Oliver.</i>

04:47.216 --> 04:50.734
Right, right, right, right,
right, right.

04:50.736 --> 04:52.820
Please, sir,
may I have a kiss?

04:52.822 --> 04:54.822
(chuckles)
Stop it!

04:54.824 --> 04:57.057
(normal voice):
No, seriously, I want a kiss.

04:58.410 --> 04:59.660
All right.

05:01.913 --> 05:05.332
- Mm. So...
- Hmm?

05:05.334 --> 05:07.084
would you like to stay
for dinner tonight?

05:07.086 --> 05:09.670
Oh, I'd love to, but I have
to pick up my daughter.

05:09.672 --> 05:10.737
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

05:10.739 --> 05:13.174
- How about dinner this weekend?
- Sure.

05:13.176 --> 05:15.709
Great.
You like Mexican food?

05:15.711 --> 05:17.077
I do.

05:17.079 --> 05:18.512
Ooh, terrific.

05:18.514 --> 05:20.097
So we'll go to Guadalajara.

05:20.099 --> 05:21.966
Oh, that a new
restaurant?

05:21.968 --> 05:24.268
No, it's an old city in Mexico.

05:24.270 --> 05:26.971
You want to go to
Mexico for dinner?

05:26.973 --> 05:29.473
Yep. We'll take my plane.

05:29.475 --> 05:30.808
I'll have you back
by midnight.

05:30.810 --> 05:33.060
So, hang on--
you-you don't own a pen,

05:33.062 --> 05:34.728
but you own a plane?

05:34.730 --> 05:36.263
Yeah, you can
always borrow a pen.

05:36.265 --> 05:37.598
Try to borrow a plane.

05:38.950 --> 05:40.150
- So...
- Mm?

05:40.152 --> 05:41.485
what do you say?

05:41.487 --> 05:45.456
Hmm... Let me see if
I can get a sitter.

05:45.458 --> 05:46.907
Oh!

05:46.909 --> 05:47.992
Yay!

05:47.994 --> 05:49.793
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, I think we should

05:49.795 --> 05:51.945
start making plans
for Christmas.

05:51.947 --> 05:56.050
We can go surfing in Fiji,
skiing in the Alps,

05:56.052 --> 05:57.067
making out in Malibu.

05:57.069 --> 05:59.837
Yes, now, Walden,
let's be very clear:

05:59.839 --> 06:02.306
You are a sweet and
wonderful guy,

06:02.308 --> 06:03.591
but you've just come out

06:03.593 --> 06:05.792
of a very long-term relationship,
- Sweet and wonderful.

06:05.794 --> 06:07.628
so you're clearly on
the rebound.

06:07.630 --> 06:09.179
Uh-huh. So?

06:09.181 --> 06:10.347
Yes. So I don't know

06:10.349 --> 06:12.933
if we should be making
Christmas plans just yet.

06:12.935 --> 06:14.318
- Okay.
- Hmm?

06:14.320 --> 06:17.905
Fine.
We'll slow things down.

06:17.907 --> 06:18.989
Good.

06:18.991 --> 06:20.157
Forget Christmas.

06:20.159 --> 06:21.825
Thank you.

06:21.827 --> 06:23.360
You'll be my Valentine,
though, right?

06:23.362 --> 06:24.411
Oh, my God.

06:24.413 --> 06:27.031
You're like no man
I've ever met.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.666
Mmm! A bit of an
odd bloke, eh, what?

06:28.668 --> 06:29.833
Oh, God, stop it.

06:29.835 --> 06:31.785
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink,
say no more.

06:35.257 --> 06:38.058
This is nice.
Like old times.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.043
How so?

06:39.045 --> 06:41.362
You and me, sitting
here, watching TV

06:41.364 --> 06:43.163
while the good-looking
owner of the house is

06:43.165 --> 06:45.966
out on the deck swapping
spit with a hot chick.

06:45.968 --> 06:49.603
Yeah, there is
a bit of deja vu.

06:49.605 --> 06:50.638
Not only that.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.007
It feels like it's
happened before.

06:56.061 --> 06:57.978
Yes, it does.

06:59.698 --> 07:02.483
Man, I've seen so much
crazy stuff in this house,

07:02.485 --> 07:03.701
I could write a book.

07:03.703 --> 07:05.753
That's a good idea.
Got a title?

07:05.755 --> 07:07.404
Hmm...

07:07.406 --> 07:08.872
Maybe I can't
write a book.

07:08.874 --> 07:11.442
WALDEN:
All right then, cheerio!

07:11.444 --> 07:12.493
(door closes)

07:12.495 --> 07:13.711
Cheerio?

07:13.713 --> 07:15.329
Means "good-bye"
in England.

07:15.331 --> 07:16.463
Oh.

07:16.465 --> 07:17.998
What do they have for
breakfast over there,

07:18.000 --> 07:19.833
a bowl of good-byes?

07:21.152 --> 07:22.836
- 'Ello, lads.
- Well, hey.

07:22.838 --> 07:25.339
So, Zoey seems very nice.

07:25.341 --> 07:28.709
Yeah, the bird really tickles
my fancy.

07:28.711 --> 07:30.010
Help me out here.

07:30.012 --> 07:32.546
Is "fancy" the English
word for "nutsack"?

07:35.850 --> 07:38.018
No, it means that I like her.

07:38.020 --> 07:39.770
I think this could get serious.

07:39.772 --> 07:41.822
Wow, you're moving pretty quick,
aren't you?

07:41.824 --> 07:43.657
That's what she said.

07:43.659 --> 07:44.825
(chuckles)

07:44.827 --> 07:46.493
What are you laughing at?

07:46.495 --> 07:48.562
He did a "That's what
she said" joke.

07:48.564 --> 07:49.747
Because that's what she said.

07:49.749 --> 07:54.034
Oh. That's not funny.

07:54.036 --> 07:56.370
She thinks I'm on the rebound.

07:56.372 --> 07:57.738
Well, aren't you?

07:57.740 --> 07:59.456
You were with Bridget
for 15 years.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.875
That's over.
I signed the divorce papers.

08:01.877 --> 08:04.845
(sighs)
I'm ready to fall in love again.

08:04.847 --> 08:07.848
Please tell me you didn't
actually say that to her.

08:07.850 --> 08:08.932
Why?

08:08.934 --> 08:12.219
Dude, even I know that's wrong.

08:14.272 --> 08:16.557
Walden, you're young,
you're rich, you're handsome.

08:16.559 --> 08:18.359
If I was even one
of those things

08:18.361 --> 08:21.028
I would have screwed myself
to death years ago.

08:21.030 --> 08:23.096
Well, I want to be in
a relationship...

08:23.098 --> 08:27.034
with romance and intimacy
and commitment.

08:27.036 --> 08:29.603
Oh, I get it. You're a chick.

08:31.740 --> 08:34.107
Jake, we're living in
his house.

08:34.109 --> 08:37.126
A very nice chick.

08:44.969 --> 08:48.338
This is absolutely
ridiculous.

08:48.340 --> 08:50.674
You don't have to wear the hat
if you don't want to.

08:50.676 --> 08:53.977
It's not the hat.
Well, it's not totally the hat.

08:53.979 --> 08:57.765
It's the incredible
extravagance.

08:57.767 --> 09:00.734
You do realize I'm still not
ready to sleep with you, yes?

09:00.736 --> 09:02.302
Oh, I'm not trying
to have sex with you.

09:02.304 --> 09:04.571
Why not?
What's wrong with me?

09:04.573 --> 09:07.274
Nothing. Why? Do you want
to have sex with me?

09:07.276 --> 09:10.661
Yeah! No! No, it's too soon.
It's too soon.

09:10.663 --> 09:13.781
Well, is it too soon...

09:13.783 --> 09:15.532
for this?

09:15.534 --> 09:18.619
Oh, God, Walden,
what have you done?

09:21.756 --> 09:23.323
(gasps)

09:24.676 --> 09:25.793
What do you think?

09:25.795 --> 09:28.345
I think you're out
of your bloody mind.

09:28.347 --> 09:29.680
I can't accept this.

09:29.682 --> 09:30.664
Why not?

09:30.666 --> 09:32.850
Because it's too much.

09:32.852 --> 09:34.518
It's crazy!

09:34.520 --> 09:36.770
What about getting a diamond
necklace for a girl

09:39.358 --> 09:41.275
on your private jet is crazy?

09:42.310 --> 09:44.061
Okay, when I say it out loud

09:44.063 --> 09:45.479
it does sound a little crazy.

09:45.481 --> 09:48.031
Good thing I didn't get you
the matching tiara.

09:49.183 --> 09:51.985
Okay, uh, there might be
one other thing.

09:51.987 --> 09:54.455
Oh, God, you didn't buy me
a pony, did you?

09:54.457 --> 09:55.856
No. Why, do you want one?

09:55.858 --> 09:56.857
No, I don't.

09:56.859 --> 09:59.693
The thing is, I know some people

09:59.695 --> 10:01.462

of the private school

10:01.464 --> 10:03.664
you're trying to get
your daughter in,

10:03.666 --> 10:05.332
so I pulled some strings
and got her enrolled.

10:05.334 --> 10:09.002
Wait-- you got Ava
into Bellwood?

10:09.004 --> 10:12.005
But don't worry, one phone call
and she's out on her ass.

10:12.007 --> 10:13.874
No, don't do that!

10:13.876 --> 10:15.208
Walden, this is wonderful!

10:15.210 --> 10:17.210
You're not upset?

10:17.212 --> 10:19.847
No! No, no, no.

10:19.849 --> 10:21.849
What you did is brilliant.

10:21.851 --> 10:24.351
Mm!
Utterly brilliant.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.548
Yeah, but rebounds
work out sometimes.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.749

13:21.275 --> 13:23.392
Okay.

13:23.394 --> 13:25.627
- Hello.
- Hey.

13:25.629 --> 13:27.896
Hi.

13:27.898 --> 13:31.600
It's very weird that you
live with these people.

13:33.353 --> 13:35.904
So what's he gonna
do about Zoey?

13:35.906 --> 13:38.690
Well, unless I miss my guess,

13:38.692 --> 13:42.327
he's gonna lie to both of them
until it blows up in his face,

13:42.329 --> 13:44.363
and everyone gets
their feelings hurt,

13:44.365 --> 13:46.331
and he's left alone
and miserable.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.250
Wow. That sucks.
Isn't there a better way to

13:48.252 --> 13:51.086
date two women
at the same time?

13:51.088 --> 13:53.038
Aw, Jake...

13:53.040 --> 13:55.990
No.

13:55.992 --> 13:59.344
I want you so badly.

13:59.346 --> 14:01.713
Yeah, yep, I, uh...

14:01.715 --> 14:04.466
...want you too.
I was such a fool.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.501
I can't believe I let someone
as great as you get away.

14:06.503 --> 14:08.303
Wait, you said I was immature.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.839
You are, but that's
part of your charm.

14:10.841 --> 14:12.941
I love you, Walden.

14:12.943 --> 14:17.195
I love you, I love you,
I love you.

14:17.197 --> 14:19.197
That is awesome.

14:19.199 --> 14:20.148
Uh...

14:20.150 --> 14:23.151
Just... okay,
okay, well...

14:23.153 --> 14:25.454
Can we just hold on
for one second?

14:25.456 --> 14:28.206
- Where are you going?
- Uh, the bathroom.

14:28.208 --> 14:29.858
Why don't you just use that one?

14:29.860 --> 14:32.026
I'm a little pee shy.

14:32.028 --> 14:33.695
I don't want you to hear me.

14:33.697 --> 14:34.963
Since when?

14:34.965 --> 14:36.381
It's a new thing.

14:36.383 --> 14:37.883
People change, Bridget,
people grow.

14:39.201 --> 14:43.038
Do you think you and Mom
would ever get back together?

14:43.040 --> 14:46.207
Well, you know I will always
care for your mother.

14:46.209 --> 14:49.394
She's a terrific lady,
and a great mom,

14:49.396 --> 14:52.714
and no one can predict
the future...

14:52.716 --> 14:54.733
but no freakin' way.

14:54.735 --> 14:56.885
She said the same thing.

14:56.887 --> 15:00.388
But used a different word
than "freakin'."

15:00.390 --> 15:01.406
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:01.408 --> 15:03.191
Hey.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.526
Everything all right?

15:04.528 --> 15:06.361
Uh, no. As Zoey would say,

15:06.363 --> 15:08.413
I'm in a bit of a sticky wicket.

15:08.415 --> 15:10.398
You mean you were
in a sticky wicket,

15:10.400 --> 15:12.901
then you finished up and
came down here for a snack.

15:12.903 --> 15:17.272
No, no, I-I have a conundrum.

15:17.274 --> 15:18.590
Then you should've worn it.

15:18.592 --> 15:21.927
Might've avoided the stickiness,
you know, wicket-wise.

15:23.429 --> 15:25.225
Okay, I'm just going
to talk to you.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.349
Please.

15:26.350 --> 15:28.517
I've been dreaming about getting
back together with Bridget

15:28.519 --> 15:32.921
for months now, but since
I met Zoey, I'm not so sure.

15:32.923 --> 15:34.739
- It is a pickle.
- What's a pickle?

15:34.741 --> 15:37.192
Shh.

15:37.194 --> 15:38.593
What does your heart tell you?

15:38.595 --> 15:41.480
My heart tells me that

15:41.482 --> 15:44.115
Bridget is the past,
and Zoey is the future.

15:44.117 --> 15:46.034
Oh, I get it.
You're trying to figure out

15:46.036 --> 15:47.285
which one gets your pickle.

15:48.404 --> 15:49.955
Essentially, yes.

15:49.957 --> 15:53.041
Well, then, I say
follow your heart.

15:53.043 --> 15:54.376
I say follow your pickle.

15:56.212 --> 15:57.879
Try to ignore him.

15:57.881 --> 16:00.715
I've been with Bridget
for 15 years.

16:00.717 --> 16:02.133
That's tough to
just walk away from.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.952
But as you said yourself,
Bridget's the past.

16:03.954 --> 16:05.804
Yeah, but if I get
back together with her,

16:05.806 --> 16:07.506
I don't have to
give up $600 million

16:07.508 --> 16:08.590
in a divorce settlement.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.425
The future's overrated.
Go with Bridget.

16:10.427 --> 16:12.677
I mean, it does make sense,
right? All I'd have to do

16:12.679 --> 16:14.229
is sell this place
and move back in with her.

16:14.231 --> 16:15.847
You can't live your
life in the past.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.816
- Go with Zoey.
- You think?

16:17.818 --> 16:19.818
I do. And I don't have
a horse in this race.

16:19.820 --> 16:21.469
No, you're right.

16:21.471 --> 16:22.821
Zoey it is.

16:22.823 --> 16:24.305
Thank you, Alan.

16:24.307 --> 16:25.657
Cheerios!

16:28.244 --> 16:30.779

16:30.781 --> 16:32.364
Shame, no.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.499

16:37.987 --> 16:40.705

16:40.707 --> 16:43.291
Oh, boy.

16:45.428 --> 16:47.328
Bridget, I can't remember--

16:47.330 --> 16:50.131
do you like your Band-Aids
taken off quick or slow?

16:50.133 --> 16:51.766
I don't understand.

16:51.768 --> 16:54.135
Let's just go with quick.

16:54.137 --> 16:56.671
I don't think it's a good
idea to sleep with you,

16:56.673 --> 16:57.889
since I started
seeing someone new

16:57.891 --> 16:59.808
and I think she might
be the real deal.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.310
Not that you weren't
the real deal,

17:02.312 --> 17:03.678
you're just the ex-real deal,

17:03.680 --> 17:06.347
and she's the next real deal.

17:07.567 --> 17:10.117
Anyway, I'd like for you you to
sign the divorce papers,

17:10.119 --> 17:12.704
so we can both go meet
people we like better.

17:13.990 --> 17:16.540
- What?
- Friends?

17:17.710 --> 17:19.994
- I am so humiliated!
- I'm sorry!

17:19.997 --> 17:22.580
I can't believe you waited till
I was half naked in your bed

17:22.583 --> 17:24.132
to tell me you were
seeing someone else!

17:24.134 --> 17:27.135
Kind of hard to bring up while
you're taking off my pants.

17:28.471 --> 17:29.888
And by the way,
you look sensational.

17:29.890 --> 17:31.372
The Pilates is
really paying off.

17:31.374 --> 17:33.892
Go to hell,
you son of a bitch!

17:33.894 --> 17:35.393
How about an "attaboy" for not

17:35.395 --> 17:37.596
having sex with you out of
respect for the other woman

17:37.598 --> 17:38.680
I'm falling in love with?

17:38.682 --> 17:39.898
BRIDGET:
Drop dead!

17:45.271 --> 17:47.188
How many times have
we seen this movie?

17:47.190 --> 17:48.556
Too many to count.

17:48.558 --> 17:50.775
Maybe it's the house.

17:50.777 --> 17:52.661
- What do you mean?
- I think it's haunted.

17:52.663 --> 17:56.281
Like, built on an angry
woman burial ground.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.733
Certainly can't be the fault
of the men who live in it.

17:58.735 --> 18:00.502
Sometimes at night,
if I'm really quiet,

18:00.504 --> 18:02.771
I think I can hear
them bitching.

18:07.793 --> 18:10.095
That didn't go as well
as I'd hoped.

18:10.097 --> 18:11.429
I wouldn't worry about it.

18:11.431 --> 18:13.515
She doesn't look like
the type to carry a grudge.

18:13.517 --> 18:14.683

18:22.725 --> 18:25.927
