[clears throat]

00:13.888 --> 00:16.433
Let me be the first to tell you:
I'm bad news.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.601
You're actually not the first
to tell me that.

00:18.685 --> 00:22.397
I can't offer you parental guidance
or advice or love or support

00:22.480 --> 00:24.774
or prolonged conversation
or interest in you,

00:24.858 --> 00:27.068
-or remembering your name.
-It's Hollyhock.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.738
-And I'm not looking for another dad.
-Great.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.198
But I've always wanted to know
who my mother is.

00:32.282 --> 00:35.076
Your mother? What do I look like,
Josh Radnor?

00:35.160 --> 00:38.663
Nothing? Nothing for Josh Radnor.
How quickly we forget.

00:38.747 --> 00:43.877
Just tell me the name of the woman
you had sex with in December 1999.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.004
That's all the relationship
we need to have.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.673
That was quite a time
for our nation, sex-wise...

00:48.757 --> 00:52.260
<i>♪ Oh, 1999 ♪</i>

00:52.343 --> 00:55.597
Actually, I don't need a whole long story.
Just get to the point.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.974
The point is I banged a lot of women.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.269
One-night stands, two-night stands,
nooners, spooners, hot-air ballooners.

01:01.352 --> 01:05.440
So, out of all of these women
it sounds like you really respected,

01:05.523 --> 01:07.901
is there any chance
one of them got pregnant

01:07.984 --> 01:09.944
and then put the baby up for adoption?

01:10.028 --> 01:13.490
I guess Marcy was kind of
a poking holes in the condom type.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.116
Real nutter. Good lay, though.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.661
Glad to hear my mother
was a "nutter" and "a good lay."

01:18.745 --> 01:20.371
Can I meet her? Where is she?

01:20.455 --> 01:23.583
I bet she's still in that same apartment
in the Valley. What a dump!

01:23.666 --> 01:24.709
Can you take me there?

01:24.793 --> 01:27.504
Help me find my mom
and I'll leave you alone forever.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.339
Deal. But can we go in the morning?

01:29.422 --> 01:31.800
[yawning] It's getting pretty late,
I become a real asshole

01:31.883 --> 01:34.344
if I don't get a solid seven hours
of bed drinking a night.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.262
I should get going.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.933
My hostel's all the way downtown
in a pretty bad area.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.976
Wait.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.479
-Take this.
-Okay.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.941
Here I go, hope there are
no murderers out.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.984
Yes, everyone hopes that all the time.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.695
-Okay, just do me a favor.
-Ugh! What now?

01:52.779 --> 01:55.490
If I do get murdered,
will you call my eight dads

01:55.573 --> 01:56.991
and tell them I love them?

01:57.075 --> 01:59.953
I gotta call all eight? They can't
work out a phone tree? [groans]

02:00.036 --> 02:02.080
If you're gonna be a baby,
stay here for the night.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.207
-All right!
-Take the couch and be quiet.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.335
Don't get on your phone and text
all your friends how sweet my house is.

02:07.418 --> 02:11.131
Turn off all the lights when you're
going to sleep, all of the lights.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.719
[click]

02:16.803 --> 02:18.930
-Thank you, BoJack.

-Oh, you're-- you're in my--

03:18.406 --> 03:20.408
-Wait, I'm not really--
-What if we try...

03:20.491 --> 03:22.368
Wait, I'm almost... Oh, no.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.287
I don't think it's going to happen.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.456
[sighs] I'm sorry,
it's just difficult with all the--

03:26.539 --> 03:27.373
[air horn blares]

03:27.457 --> 03:29.375
-[Katrina] Who gave Todd the air horn?
-Right.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.002
-The campaign.
-Exactly.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.879
But it's just another two months, right?

03:32.962 --> 03:35.215
After the election
everything goes back to normal.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.467
-Well, unless I win.
-Right.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.594
I gotta tell you, I'm having a blast.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.930
I always knew I was probably
good at something,

03:42.013 --> 03:43.681
but I never knew what it was.

03:43.765 --> 03:47.393
Thanks to Katrina, I've finally realized
I'm good at people liking me.

03:47.477 --> 03:51.231
That's great, and you know
I'm so happy for you,

03:51.314 --> 03:55.276
but do you have to be
the pro-fracking candidate?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.695
-[shudders]
-Diane, this is the campaign.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.240
Nothing anyone says
during a campaign matters.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.076
It's just promising a bunch of stuff
to get people to vote for you.

04:03.159 --> 04:06.371
Then when you get an office,
you can do whatever you want.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.706
-Democracy in action.
-Mark my words--

04:08.790 --> 04:11.292
the only fracking
that's going to be happening

04:11.376 --> 04:14.003
-is in this bedroom.
-All right, guy.

04:14.087 --> 04:18.091
I'm gonna drill you deep,
and fill you with a mysterious substance

04:18.174 --> 04:21.886
that scientists still don't quite
understand the ramifications of.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.265
-This isn't sexy for me-- aaah!
-Did someone say "busy day"?

04:25.348 --> 04:29.143
No one said "busy day," Katrina.
What <i>did </i>we say about knocking?

04:29.227 --> 04:31.145
It wastes vital seconds
we'll never get back?

04:31.229 --> 04:34.107
Anyway, everyone who isn't me
needs to shut up right now.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.026
-No one else was talking.
-I actually have good news for once.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.821
CNN released a poll today,
and for the first time ever,

04:39.904 --> 04:42.198
-Mr. Peanutbutter is up.
-Damn!

04:42.282 --> 04:44.784
Wow! Am I John Davidson,
Cathy Lee Crosby

04:44.867 --> 04:47.078
and Fran Tarkenton right now,
because that's--

04:47.161 --> 04:49.330
We don't have time for the reference
you're setting up.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.916
We're doing a presser in 30.
Go downstairs, get some breakfast.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.209
Yeah! Breakfast!

04:53.293 --> 04:56.754
Am I Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald,
Judd Nelson, the principal...

04:56.838 --> 04:58.131
-Just get breakfast!
-All right!

-Don't you forget about me.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.927
-Diane, you look sad.
-We were kind of in the middle of--

05:03.011 --> 05:05.305
No, I'm saying you <i>look </i>sad.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.558
Maybe you need to put on foundation,
blush around the cheeks or something.

-Aaah! Aaah!

05:19.277 --> 05:20.278
What's going on down here?

05:20.361 --> 05:23.656
I was trying to make you breakfast
to thank you for letting me stay here!

05:23.740 --> 05:25.992
I put a Pop-Tart in the microwave!

05:26.075 --> 05:29.620
-Did you take the foil off?
-No! I was doing it popcorn style!

05:29.704 --> 05:32.290
It's all right, it's not your fault.
Making food is impossible.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.542
Let's get out of here
and take you to your mom's house.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.210
Should we do something about the fire?

05:36.294 --> 05:39.172
Just leave it.
It'll tire itself out eventually.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.631
[munching]

05:40.715 --> 05:41.966
So, who is this lady?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.927
It's actually a cute story.
She was the president of my fan club.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.805
You had sex with the president
of your fan club?

05:47.889 --> 05:49.599
Yeah. "Oh, my God, what a monster!"

05:49.682 --> 05:52.018
I slept with someone who loved me
more than anybody else

05:52.101 --> 05:55.438
and dedicated her life to knowing things
about me and caring about me.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.023
How could I be so shallow?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.901
You're right, I'm sorry.
Finish your cute story.

05:59.984 --> 06:01.235
That was the whole story.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.738
She was the president of my fan club,
I had sex with her.

06:03.821 --> 06:07.033
Then I didn't think about her
for 18 years, and here we are.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.456
[sighs]

06:15.041 --> 06:17.585

-Good news, the results are in!

06:17.668 --> 06:19.712

-Bad news, the results are bad.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.548
Like an omelet bar
at a mongoose convention,

06:22.632 --> 06:25.093
you are running dangerously low on eggs.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.469
How many do I have left?

06:26.552 --> 06:29.222
Well, let's just say
it's more than Harry Potter movies,

06:29.305 --> 06:31.182
but fewer than James Bond movies.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.142
-Doctor, no!
-What do you recommend?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.978
Hmm. Have you considered
impregnating a younger woman?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.147
No, I want to do it with this woman.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.149
You could try throwing money
at the problem.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.027
You're gonna want pre-natal vitamins,
cervical mucus boosters,

06:43.111 --> 06:45.655
a "You Can Do It!" poster,
and an iOvulate.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.782
- "iOvulate"?
- Let's hope so!

06:47.865 --> 06:49.742
This state-of-the-art bracelet
tracks your cycle

06:49.826 --> 06:52.745
and also gives you up-to-date info
on your ovulation.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.956
-Plus, it's voiced by Harvey Fierstein.
-[chiming]

06:55.039 --> 06:59.168
<i>Hello, I'm Harvey Fierstein.</i>
<i>Let's put a baby in you.</i>

06:59.252 --> 07:00.962
[both] Ooh!

07:03.422 --> 07:04.799
[exhales]

07:04.882 --> 07:05.716
BoJack?

07:05.800 --> 07:08.052
Marcy, hey.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.638
-I knew it. I knew you'd come back.
-Right. Um...

07:10.721 --> 07:13.307
here's a very specific question:
after we had sex,

07:13.391 --> 07:15.977
did you by any chance get pregnant
and put a baby up for adoption?

07:16.060 --> 07:17.103
-Yes.
-Wait, really?

07:17.186 --> 07:20.773
Oh, my God, you're my mother.
Can I hug you?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.733
-I'm hugging my mother.
-Wow.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.319
BoJack, I'm sorry,
I really wanted to tell you.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.864
But when I called the number
that you gave me,

07:27.947 --> 07:30.408
it was for a sandwich shop in Temecula.

07:30.491 --> 07:33.578
Wha...? That's so weird.
You must have dialed it wrong.

07:33.661 --> 07:37.874
And then I thought, well, you know,
sooner or later you'd call me.

07:37.957 --> 07:41.878
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna,
but then, you know, 9/11 happened...

07:41.961 --> 07:44.589
-Can you ever forgive me?
-I think so.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.842
Oh! I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?
Please come in.

07:47.925 --> 07:51.721
And that was just such
a tough time for our country...

07:53.890 --> 07:58.144
So, once we introduced vicious knife-play
into our routine,

07:58.227 --> 08:01.105
it really gave our sex life the edge.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.231
Love it, crooshed it.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.443
So the article is just about
a happy marriage with a healthy sex life?

08:05.526 --> 08:08.654
We already have Raquel's piece
about 69 days of sixty-nining.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.739
-Uh-huh!
-So croosh.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.825
What about our readers
who <i>aren't</i> having sex with their husbands?

08:12.909 --> 08:14.660
Isn't this just gonna make them feel bad?

08:14.744 --> 08:18.080
Not everyone gets to have
great sex all the time, right?

08:18.706 --> 08:19.790
Ladies?

08:20.583 --> 08:23.336
Diane? Can I talk to you
in your office for a minute?

08:23.419 --> 08:24.504
I don't have an office.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.131
You said offices have corners
and corners are the patriarchy.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.927
Fine. Can I talk to you in the hot-take,
cool-down yoga area?

08:31.761 --> 08:34.764
[deep breathing]

08:34.847 --> 08:35.848
You seem tense.

08:35.932 --> 08:39.018
Have you been eating gluten
and also not having sex with your husband?

08:39.101 --> 08:40.394
Whoa, Stefani, that's not--

08:40.478 --> 08:45.942
Diane, relax! This is not a conversation
between an employee and her superior.

08:46.025 --> 08:50.279
This is a conversation
between a friend and her superior.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.324
The campaign
has been testing our marriage.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.993
Obviously, it's great to see
Mr. Peanutbutter so excited,

08:56.077 --> 08:57.745
and I am supporting that.

08:57.828 --> 08:58.913
But if I'm being honest,

08:58.996 --> 09:01.791
I can't wait for it to be over
so things can go back to normal.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.877
-Hmm. And what happens if he wins?
-He's not going to win.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.338
Did you see the new CNN poll this morning?

09:07.421 --> 09:10.091
He could win. People do love fracking.

09:10.174 --> 09:14.095
It's fun to say! "Frack! Frack!
Fricky-fricky-frack" [laughs]

09:14.178 --> 09:17.598
People wouldn't love saying it
if they understood what it actually was.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.101
-So tell them.
-I can't go against my husband.

09:20.184 --> 09:23.104
What the frack? Why not?
You gotta do you, girl.

09:23.187 --> 09:25.773
I always say, you gotta do you.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.943
And if he's doing him,
then who's doing you?

09:29.026 --> 09:32.280
Because right now,
it seems like no one's doing you.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.531
[groans]

09:35.741 --> 09:37.118
...and then when I was eight,

09:37.201 --> 09:40.371
Lizzie Dunbar's mom rented us all
<i>Freaky Friday</i> for a sleepover,

09:40.454 --> 09:44.750
and I got really sad because I realized
I didn't have a mom to switch bodies with.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.919
Am I talking a lot?
I feel I'm talking a lot.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.005
-Yes.
-Oh! I need to show you something.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.465
Okay, so this may seem cuckoo,

09:51.549 --> 09:54.260
but I was so head over heels
in love with your father

09:54.343 --> 09:57.555
that after we made sweet love,
and he didn't call me again,

09:57.638 --> 10:01.350
I just got so jealous, so I made a list
of every girl he was with...

10:01.434 --> 10:03.394
and I found their home addresses...

10:03.477 --> 10:05.688
-Oh.
-...and drew Xs over their eyes.

10:05.771 --> 10:09.984
I'm loving this conversation
but I have to go the bathroom now,

10:10.067 --> 10:14.905
for non-me being weirded out
by this conversation-related reasons.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.908
I just keep thinking about
how different things would have been

10:17.992 --> 10:19.285
if you'd have just called me.

10:19.368 --> 10:23.247
We could have had a family together
for 18 loving years.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.957
-That might have--
-[Hollyhock] BoJack!

10:25.041 --> 10:26.500
[groans] Kids. What?

10:26.584 --> 10:28.586
Can you join me
in the bathroom for a minute?

10:28.669 --> 10:29.670
What?! No!

10:29.754 --> 10:33.466
-Do you want me, sweetheart?
-No, it's a dad bathroom thing.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.719
Uh... Hollyhock?

10:36.802 --> 10:39.764
That woman is not my mother.
She's lying to us!

10:39.847 --> 10:40.973
Marcy? No way!

10:41.057 --> 10:43.768
Look. This is from the premiere
of <i>Autumn in New York.</i>

10:43.851 --> 10:47.897
That movie came out in August of 2000.
I was born in September.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.232
Does this woman look
eight months pregnant to you?

10:50.316 --> 10:53.778
Why would they release a romantic drama
called <i>Autumn in New York</i>

10:53.861 --> 10:54.945
in the middle of summer?

10:55.029 --> 10:57.073
Richard Gere
had just done <i>Runaway Bride,</i>

10:57.156 --> 10:59.367
Winona Ryder was hot off
<i>Girl, Interrupted</i>

10:59.450 --> 11:01.827
-so the studio got cocky.
-How do you know all this?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.497
I looked it up on the Internet
because I saw this picture

11:04.580 --> 11:07.416
and got confused why Marcy
would wear a summer dress

11:07.500 --> 11:09.543
to a movie called
<i>Autumn in New York.</i>

11:09.627 --> 11:12.171
This is a summer dress?
I guess I don't know dresses.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.757
BoJack, focus! That's not my mom!

11:14.840 --> 11:17.676
So the lesson here is
I was right to never call her.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.637
-Wait, so who--
-[Marcy] Are you okay in there?

11:19.720 --> 11:21.847
-Don't come in!
-Yes! Father-daughter bathroom time!

11:21.931 --> 11:25.476
The scrapbook! She has that list
of all the other women you slept with.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.853
If we get the book, we can find my mom.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.399
Give me a few minutes. I'll distract her,
then you sneak in and grab the book.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.444
[BoJack] Okay.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.531
And what was the first appearance
of the Horse's identical cousin?

11:38.614 --> 11:40.866
[Marcy] Season eight, episode four.

11:40.950 --> 11:45.121
[BoJack] Yeah, yeah. That's right.
What was the horse's boss's name?

11:45.204 --> 11:47.248
-What are you doing?
-Oh, my God!

11:47.331 --> 11:49.125
You're not supposed to see this.
Look away!

11:49.208 --> 11:51.877
It's okay, Hollyhock.
This is what Mommy and Daddy do.

11:51.961 --> 11:55.506
-Ugh! You said give you a few minutes!
-I didn't think it would take this long.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.757
I usually finish faster.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.844
-You're disgusting!
-[moans] That's what I needed.

12:04.014 --> 12:07.768
-Can I please have a grasshopper?
-[seductively] Yes?

12:07.852 --> 12:10.604
So the studio finished<i> Mars Attacks!</i>
without him.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.606
And since no one ever found a body,

12:12.690 --> 12:15.109
my client Tony Tromboni
has been making movies

12:15.192 --> 12:17.987
-under the name Tim Burton ever since.
-Oh!

12:18.070 --> 12:19.613
-[chiming]
-<i>I'm Harvey Fierstein.</i>

12:19.697 --> 12:24.076
<i>Your ovulation window is closing soon.</i>
<i>Please commence copulation.</i>

12:24.160 --> 12:25.578
Oh, fish! We gotta go.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.663
-Can't we finish lunch?
-You heard the bracelet.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.206
Okay, well, uh, let me get the check.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.001
-There's no time for that! Ralph!
-We gotta pay for our--

12:32.084 --> 12:35.129
I have an egg inside me
that is ripe to be fertilized.

12:35.212 --> 12:36.922
His name is Philbert.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.425
-Princess Carolyn--
-Uh-uh! Philbert Stilton,

12:39.508 --> 12:43.721
and he's going to be sweet and smart
and a phenom on the clarinet,

12:43.804 --> 12:46.891
and one day you'll be driving him home
from band practice

12:46.974 --> 12:50.853
and he's going to all of a sudden
say something so insightful and true

12:50.936 --> 12:55.649
that you'll be positively floored
it came out of the mouth of your son.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.694
But if you don't take me home right now
and impregnate me,

12:58.777 --> 13:01.113
-then Philbert will never exist.
-[plates clatter]

13:01.197 --> 13:02.948
Okay, let's go.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.287
-You told me to distract her.
-We don't need to talk about it.

13:08.370 --> 13:11.290
So now that we got the list,
we gotta go see all these other women?

13:11.373 --> 13:13.792
Not all of them,
just the ones you didn't see

13:13.876 --> 13:16.420
in the nine months
after you had sex with them.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.506
-That's gonna be most of them.
-Yeah, figures.

13:18.589 --> 13:19.715
Ooh!

13:19.798 --> 13:24.762
Tilda Madison? You dated the Timedium,
Tuesdays at 9:00 on CBS?

13:24.845 --> 13:27.139
I never understood that show.
What's a Timedium?

13:27.223 --> 13:28.265
She's a medium,

13:28.349 --> 13:30.935
but she can also travel through time
and she solves crimes.

13:31.018 --> 13:34.188
That's so stupid.
She time-travels and she's a medium?

13:34.271 --> 13:37.608
But the one crime she can't solve
is her husband's murder.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.068
[groans]

13:39.151 --> 13:40.945
[sitar playing]

13:41.028 --> 13:45.533
So my name is Hollyhock and I love apples
but hate applesauce, too slimy.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.451
I was the captain of the JV soccer team--

13:47.535 --> 13:51.664
BoJack, why did you bring this child
into my sanctum?

13:51.747 --> 13:52.873
I can make this real quick.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.000
Did you give up my secret baby
in the year 2000?

13:55.084 --> 13:57.962
Oh, BoJack, do you recall
the impetus for our uncoupling?

13:58.045 --> 14:00.089
Is every one of these
gonna be a whole thing?

14:00.172 --> 14:02.007
You were a cad and a boor.

14:02.091 --> 14:08.681
But your fits of sardonic japery amused,
to a point, until you impregnated me.

14:08.764 --> 14:12.059
Suddenly, I was awash in dreams
of idealized domesticity.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.770
But when I told you I was with child,

14:14.853 --> 14:17.940
I received a check in the mail
for $200 with the memo line,

14:18.023 --> 14:20.359
"BoJack's half of the abortion."

14:20.442 --> 14:21.902
So you put me up for adoption?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.863
Child, no. I had the abortion.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.615
Nice. You don't want
any little BoJacks floating around.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.701
Last thing this world needs
is more of this garbage.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.996
-Uh, excuse me?
-No, you're great, you seem cool,

14:32.079 --> 14:34.582
but if we could go back in time
and prevent it...

14:34.665 --> 14:35.666
-Right?
-[groans]

14:35.749 --> 14:37.042
Hollyhock, I didn't mean...

14:39.461 --> 14:42.798
By the way, your show sucks.
Should be called <i>Tedium.</i>

14:42.882 --> 14:44.216
-[tires screeching]
-[horn honks]

14:44.300 --> 14:45.342
[chiming]

14:45.426 --> 14:49.805
<i>Your uterus contains the secrets of life,</i>
<i>the ability to create.</i>

14:49.889 --> 14:51.765
-Go, go! Oh, God!
-I'm going!

14:51.849 --> 14:55.519
<i>At this point, your ovum has burst out</i>
<i>of the swollen follicle,</i>

14:55.603 --> 14:58.731
<i>traveled down the long gentle river</i>
<i>of the fallopian tube,</i>

14:58.814 --> 15:03.152
<i>and been welcomed by the warm embrace</i>
<i>of the silk-lined uterus.</i>

15:03.235 --> 15:04.236
No, no, no.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.866
<i>You must fertilize that precious ovum now</i>
<i>or it will disintegrate into nothingness.</i>

15:08.949 --> 15:11.243
Hit the gas! Do it for Philbert!

15:12.995 --> 15:14.288
[siren blaring]

15:14.371 --> 15:17.207
-Pull over your vehicle, now!
-[groans]

15:17.291 --> 15:19.001
Oh, fish!

15:19.585 --> 15:23.631
So in conclusion, I don't think California
is the greatest state in the country.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.008
But it can be.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.261
Beautifully put.
I'd like to drill down, as it were,

15:29.345 --> 15:31.889
-on the subject of fracking.
-Drill away.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.808
Now, mere hours ago
your wife, Diane Nguyen,

15:34.892 --> 15:36.644
seen here eating a messy sandwich,

15:36.727 --> 15:40.272
published an essay online
titled "The Case Against Fracking"

15:40.356 --> 15:41.941
in which she posits, quote...

15:42.024 --> 15:45.861
"If these frack-happy politicians
even knew how dangerous it was,

15:45.945 --> 15:47.821
they wouldn't allow it
in their own backyards."

15:47.905 --> 15:49.698
-Diane wrote that?
-Damn.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.701
Mr. Peanutbutter,
your wife has issued a challenge.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.913
Would you allow fracking
in your own backyard?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.498
I would.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.459
Joining us now via Periscope
is Frankie Flackery,

16:00.542 --> 16:03.754
foreman and spokesyak
for Flackery Will Get You Everywhere

16:03.837 --> 16:05.381
industrial drilling company.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.717
-How are ya?
-Flackery Flack, let's talk frack.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.346
Mr. Peanutbutter has invited you
to drill on his property.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.682
-Uh--
-Will you take him up on this invitation?

16:14.765 --> 16:17.726
-I could have a team there this afternoon.
-Oh...

16:17.810 --> 16:19.687
Ready when you are, boys!

16:20.604 --> 16:23.565
Sir, I apologize.
We are very eager to get home.

16:23.649 --> 16:27.277
You were going 36 miles per hour.
The speed limit here...

16:27.361 --> 16:28.779
is 35.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.948
-Yes.
-Now, I'm no mathematician.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.617
-I'm just a humble officer of the law.
-Okay.

16:33.701 --> 16:38.539
So you tell me, is 36 below 35
or is it above 35?

16:38.622 --> 16:40.457
Just write us a ticket and let us go.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.502
Now, now, talking back
to Officer Meow Meow is a major no-no.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.963
-[chiming]
<i>-Hello! Harvey Fierstein here.</i>

16:46.046 --> 16:49.258
Oh! Who said that?
Is there another man in your vehicle?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.843
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Show yourself, fiend!

16:50.926 --> 16:52.720
We don't have time for this! I'm in heat!

16:52.803 --> 16:54.388
Ma'am, you need to calm down!

16:54.471 --> 16:57.057
Don't tell me to calm down
or call me ma'am!

16:57.141 --> 17:00.477
Just write us a goddamn ticket
so I can go home and mount my boyfriend!

17:00.561 --> 17:03.522
That's enough!
Out of the car, all three of you!

17:06.316 --> 17:08.444
Obviously, I didn't mean you.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.195
You're giving me the silent treatment?

17:10.279 --> 17:11.905
I guess I have thin skin.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.450
Must be the half of me
that's made of garbage.

17:14.533 --> 17:17.036
[sighs] Well, who else is on this list?

17:17.119 --> 17:21.081
Stacy, Fabiana... Tonya Harding?
She is not gonna be happy to see me.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.417
She said sleeping with me
is the worst thing she ever did.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.128
I'm sorry it's so unpleasant for you

17:26.211 --> 17:28.881
to have to interact
with women you were shitty to.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.758
I don't understand
why we're even doing this.

17:30.841 --> 17:33.302
You're never gonna switch bodies
with your mom.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.512
That ship has sailed
and is also impossible.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.139
-Pull over the car.
-No.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.224
-Pull over now!
-Jesus. Fine.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.271
-I'm gonna do the rest of this on my own.
-No. Hollyhock.

17:44.354 --> 17:48.442
I got the list. I don't need you anymore.
Have a bad life.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.611
Joke's on you, I already have one!

17:54.656 --> 17:56.492
Oh no. No. No, no.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.827
Where's Mr. Peanutbutter?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.705
He's giving a stump speech
on the subject of stumps.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.666
-Turns out he's pro. Great for sitting.
-[groans]

18:04.750 --> 18:07.252
I'd be careful with that faucet,
the water comes out very hot

18:07.336 --> 18:08.337
because of the fracking.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.256
Aaah! How could you let him do this?

18:11.340 --> 18:13.550
You're the one who called his bluff.
Don't do that.

18:13.634 --> 18:17.221
-This just makes my job harder.
-I didn't "call his bluff." I just--

18:17.304 --> 18:21.350
Woman, you have one job:
be his wife, be supportive.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.768
I <i>am </i>being supportive.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.395
Was that you being supportive today
with that piece you wrote

18:25.479 --> 18:28.690
-for your stupid girl website?
-It's called Girl Croosh.

18:28.774 --> 18:32.277
"Stoopid Gurl" is just a subsection
of the main site.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.280
And my piece wasn't about
Mr. Peanutbutter, specifically.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.325
I'm gonna cut this conversation short,
my time is more important than yours.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.369
This goes one of two ways.

18:40.452 --> 18:43.455
Either you shut up and be pretty,
or your approximation of that,

18:43.539 --> 18:46.708
or don't support him, he resents you,
your marriage implodes.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.335
-Pick your poison.
-Damn!

18:48.418 --> 18:51.380
Not that I get to vote, but from
one Mrs. Peanutbutter to another,

18:51.463 --> 18:55.425
it's been really fun for me
to watch this new marriage fall apart.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.761
-We're not.
-So thank you, Diane,

18:57.845 --> 19:01.557
for that tiny sliver of mint
in the smoothie of dogshit

19:01.640 --> 19:04.601
that is trying to get
that popular idiot elected.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.686
Good night.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.689
Damn!

19:09.148 --> 19:10.482
[blaring]

19:15.654 --> 19:17.156
-[chiming]
<i>-I'm Harvey Fierstein,</i>

19:17.239 --> 19:19.199
<i>and I hope</i>
<i>you're almost done having sex</i>

19:19.283 --> 19:21.994
<i>because your ovulation cycle</i>
<i>will soon be ending.</i>

19:22.077 --> 19:23.162
Huh.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.706
I'm sorry we couldn't get home in time.

19:25.789 --> 19:29.042
-Your lawyer, he's good?
-The best.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.211
Then you know what we have to do?

19:31.295 --> 19:32.337
Oh!

19:32.421 --> 19:34.840
-For Philbert?
-For Philbert.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.550

19:36.633 --> 19:38.927
-What are you doing back there? Hey!
-[moaning]

19:39.011 --> 19:42.264
-Sorry you have to be here for this.
-Keep your eyes on the road.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.807
Hey! You two cut that out!

19:43.891 --> 19:48.896
I'll write you up for lewd conduct.
Lewd, crude and partially nude!

19:48.979 --> 19:52.691
Not to mention the rude 'tude
of you two dudes, while this prude...

19:52.774 --> 19:53.817
-Hey, listen to me!
-Whoa!

19:53.901 --> 19:57.070
[voice of Fierstein] <i>And so the dance</i>

20:17.216 --> 20:19.384
[groans] Fine, fine, fine.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.638
Hi, Fabiana. Before you slam the door--

20:22.721 --> 20:25.974
Did a young horse girl come by here,
about yay high?

20:26.058 --> 20:30.145
You're still mad about your dad's funeral?
That was 18 years ago!

20:30.229 --> 20:32.231
Thank you, Tonya.
I know we've had our differences,

20:32.314 --> 20:34.650
but seeing you always leaves me
weak in the knees.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.235
[groans]

20:41.240 --> 20:42.991
-[grunts]
-Hollyhock.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.119
-Was that her?
-Ugh! No.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.622
[groans]

20:48.705 --> 20:52.834
I talked to 23 women today
and none of them were my mother.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.587
-How did you find me?
-I went to everyone on that list.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.131
You talked to all those women?
Some of them--

20:58.215 --> 21:01.802
-Really haven't aged well, I know.
-I was gonna say, really hate you.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.304
Oh, yeah, that too.
But I needed to find you.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.139
To tell you I'm sorry,

21:06.223 --> 21:08.809
for being such an asshole
then and also now.

21:08.892 --> 21:12.229
This whole thing was stupid.
I never should have come out here.

21:12.312 --> 21:14.982
And I don't even care
about having a mom, really.

21:15.065 --> 21:18.277
Because I did fine
for 17 years without one.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.153
I don't need a mom.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.697
Hollyhock, it's okay to want a mom.

21:21.780 --> 21:27.119
No, it's not! Because that means my dads
weren't enough for me, and they are!

21:27.202 --> 21:28.537
[sighs]

21:28.620 --> 21:30.956
I know I just met you,
but if you do have

21:31.039 --> 21:34.334
any of the old Horseman gunk
bouncing around in that brain of yours,

21:34.418 --> 21:38.088
I gotta tell you right now
you should give up on looking for "enough"

21:38.171 --> 21:40.549
because it will never be enough.

21:40.632 --> 21:41.925
[whimpering]

21:42.009 --> 21:43.760
-[sobbing]
-Eww!

21:43.844 --> 21:46.722
-Stop that.
-I know, it's stupid.

21:48.098 --> 21:52.144
-There, there.
-You are so bad at this.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.104
What do your dads say when you cry?

21:54.187 --> 21:56.523
They say it's okay to cry,

21:56.606 --> 22:00.277
and that I shouldn't feel bad
about feeling bad.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.446
Well, that-- that's good advice, right?

22:02.529 --> 22:05.991
They're really good dads.
I should probably get back to them.

22:06.074 --> 22:08.118
Oh. You don't have to leave right away.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.162
Why don't you just
stay with me a bit longer?

22:10.245 --> 22:11.621
At least until we find your mom.

22:11.705 --> 22:15.625
How are we supposed to do that?
Every name on that list was a dead end.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.461
Oh...

22:17.544 --> 22:22.841
Yeah. But what if I told you
there's a name that isn't on that list?

22:22.924 --> 22:24.468
Someone Marcy never knew about.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.303
What? Where is she now?

22:26.386 --> 22:29.431
I don't know. But you can stay with me
while we try to find her?

22:29.514 --> 22:31.725
Okay. Yeah. What's her name?

22:31.808 --> 22:35.562
Her name was Brown Car... la.

22:35.645 --> 22:38.023
Carla Mercedes Benz... Brown.

22:38.106 --> 22:42.152
"Carla Mercedes Benzbrown"?
Weird name.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.780
-You've got a weird name.
-I guess you're right.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.324
Maybe that's the first thing
we'll talk about when I meet her.

22:47.407 --> 22:48.950
Mm-hmm?

22:50.744 --> 22:53.246
[keyboard clicking]

22:53.330 --> 22:57.334
Diane, I know. I'm sorry about the trucks,
but you didn't give me much choice.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.587
I know these last few days
have been crazy.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.381
-But this is the hard part.
-I need you to drop out of the race.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.383
-What?
-Please, Mr. Peanutbutter.

23:05.467 --> 23:06.468
This isn't worth it.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.261
I hear what you're saying

23:08.345 --> 23:11.890
and I will try to be more conscientious
of your needs.

23:11.973 --> 23:14.184
-Drop out of the race.
-Because your needs are important.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.269
I've written another piece
for Girl Croosh.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.730
It's called
"The Case Against Mr. Peanutbutter."

23:18.814 --> 23:20.816
When I hit this button,
the post goes live.

23:20.899 --> 23:21.983
Diane, don't.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.612
I don't want to.
And I won't, if you drop out of the race.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.864
Jesus, Diane. You can't do that.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.742
Because you're the only one allowed
to make decisions for this family?

23:30.826 --> 23:33.495
No. Because it's gonna come off
as a weird lovers' spat

23:33.578 --> 23:35.497
and it's just going to embarrass everyone.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.959
-Well, I'm sorry if I embarrass you.
-Oh, come on.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.294
You told me you weren't going to frack,
and now I can't

23:41.378 --> 23:45.090
turn on a faucet in my own home
without getting third-degree burns.

23:45.173 --> 23:48.552
Oh, I get it. So like always,
you're mad at someone,

23:48.635 --> 23:52.848
so your solution is to air
your dirty laundry for everyone to see.

23:52.931 --> 23:57.477
No. This is not about <i>us.</i>
I don't want <i>you </i>to be governor

23:57.561 --> 24:01.815
because you would be bad at it,
because you don't stand for anything.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.359
-[chiming]
-No! [grunts]

24:04.442 --> 24:06.903
[groans and grunts]

24:06.987 --> 24:08.446
Hey!

24:08.530 --> 24:11.575
Don't you dare.
Robert Blake gave me that mug.

24:11.658 --> 24:12.659
[grunts]

24:12.742 --> 24:14.786
No! Oh, you...

24:15.871 --> 24:17.789
[panting]

24:17.873 --> 24:18.832
[grunts]

24:23.420 --> 24:25.463
-I don't...
-Shut up. Take off your shirt.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.883
[panting and moaning]

24:30.343 --> 24:32.179

Frack me!
