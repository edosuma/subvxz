WEBVTT

00:16.766 --> 00:17.767
Hey, Kinsey.

00:20.478 --> 00:21.438
Gabe.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.231
What are you doing here?

00:23.314 --> 00:27.527
Um, you know, I just left my bike here,
and so I thought I would just check in.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.446
How's Duncan? Does he remember?

00:30.321 --> 00:31.156
No.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.533
We tried the key, but it didn't work.

00:35.744 --> 00:36.619
What happened?

00:37.662 --> 00:38.663
Is he okay?

00:39.205 --> 00:42.500
Uh, no, not at all. He's resting.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.419
I'm… I'm so sorry. That…

00:45.503 --> 00:47.338
That must be really disappointing.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.425
Is there anything I can do?
I can stay awhile.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.343
Hey, man. This isn't a good time.

00:54.137 --> 00:57.015
Yeah, I know. I was just saying
I'm really sorry about Duncan.

00:57.098 --> 01:00.435
-If there's anything I can do to help--
-Yeah, appreciate that. We're good.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.103
This is really a family thing.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.650
Kinsey?

01:09.986 --> 01:11.196
Yeah, you should go.

01:13.531 --> 01:14.908
Thanks for checking in.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.578
Yeah, no problem.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.416
Um, I'll… I'll see you guys tomorrow
at Winter Fest, right?

01:23.500 --> 01:24.501
Mmm.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.338
-Of course.
-Text me if you need anything.

01:48.691 --> 01:52.278
He's… He's been in our house constantly.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.031
He's been with you
for God knows how many hours.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.908
What the hell could he be trying to do?

01:56.991 --> 01:59.536
Could you just stop?
I'm really freaking out right now.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.540
Guys, guys, I have major news!

02:03.623 --> 02:06.084
There were two Dodges
the night of the Shadow attack.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.920
-What?
-Where'd you just come from?

02:09.003 --> 02:12.257
Nebraska. It took Rufus a while
to remember what happened,

02:12.340 --> 02:15.593
but he swears he saw
two Dodges at his house

02:15.677 --> 02:17.345
right before he passed out.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.974
Dodge had the Identity Key.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.353
-The only other person there was…
-Ellie.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.980
Exactly.

02:27.063 --> 02:28.898
What if Dodge tricked us?

02:28.982 --> 02:33.361
What if that wasn't Dodge
who you pushed into the Black Door?

02:36.114 --> 02:37.323
Oh my God.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.077
We killed Ellie.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.333
There's no way you could have known that.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.753
-We still did it!
-No, you didn't. Dodge did!

02:52.255 --> 02:54.883
She lies. She manipulates.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.180
I can't even process this right now.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.280
I feel sick.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.073
-Me too.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.534
-Hey.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.536
Mind if I join you?

03:25.955 --> 03:26.789
Erin's right.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.251
This is on Dodge.
You guys cannot blame yourselves.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.213
I think I can blame myself for being in a…

03:34.881 --> 03:37.759
what I thought
was a relationship with him for months.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.594
What kind of idiot am I?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.138
She played all of us.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.349
Believe me.

03:45.183 --> 03:48.102
But for what? What was the point?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.731
Did he ever ask about the keys?

03:53.691 --> 03:55.068
Well, yeah, but

03:56.236 --> 03:57.403
everybody does.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.448
I can't think of anything he asked
that was more than just…

04:06.621 --> 04:07.580
Wait.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.124
He asked me once

04:10.917 --> 04:12.877
about how the keys were made.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.965
He wanted to know
if Dad ever taught us how to make them.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.092
So maybe he wants to try and make a key.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.426
A key that does what?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.224
Oh shit.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.226
He knows that you made a key.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.980
That's why he cares so much
about fixing you.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.357
So why is he not
making a grab for me right now?

04:34.440 --> 04:35.566
Because I lied to him.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.320
He doesn't know
that you've had your memory restored.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.782
And we have to keep it that way

04:43.408 --> 04:45.118
until we can come up with a plan.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.370
Right.

04:47.996 --> 04:48.997
A plan.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.611
-Morning.
-Morning.

05:25.241 --> 05:27.744
You seem awfully chipper
for someone who was out so late.

05:27.827 --> 05:32.623
Ah, let's just say it was one of the most
exciting nights I've had in a while.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.168
-Awesome.
-Yeah, it was pretty awesome.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.837
God, I feel like I'm 16.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.422
Good morning, Mom.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.549
Oh. Morning, sweetheart.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.594
Listen, I've got a few things
to take care of at the theater

05:44.677 --> 05:45.803
before Winter Fest starts,

05:45.887 --> 05:48.514
so is it okay if you ride to the festival
with Tyler and Kinsey?

05:48.598 --> 05:49.682
Yeah, sure.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.642
Okay.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.771
Ooh, it's gonna be
such a fun day.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.814
-All right. I'll see you guys later.
-Bye.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.157
-How'd you sleep last night?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.036
Me too.

06:11.913 --> 06:15.041
Are you sorry
that you got your memories back?

06:15.124 --> 06:18.211
Just because everything's gotten so weird.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.465
If Dodge has her sights set on me,

06:24.342 --> 06:26.219
I'd rather know than have no idea.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.054
True.

06:28.137 --> 06:31.724
Plus, I finally feel
like I understand this place.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.024
What the…

06:41.025 --> 06:42.193
Can you hear that?

06:45.863 --> 06:46.989
Whispering?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.452
Oh yeah.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.080
Me too. Let's go!

07:04.674 --> 07:07.927
I think it's coming from down here,
in the basement.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.137
Come on. Let's go!

07:13.015 --> 07:14.892
God, I actually missed this part.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.114
No one's ever explained these
to me before.

07:36.789 --> 07:37.874
What are they?

07:39.125 --> 07:40.126
Seriously?

07:40.960 --> 07:43.671
These are how cavemen like me and your dad
listened to music.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.590
Oh! Um…

07:46.340 --> 07:49.469
Are they…
What do you call those things? Um…

07:49.552 --> 07:50.553
iPods!

07:52.096 --> 07:54.265
Sure. Something like that, yeah.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.518
Now, these were
your dad's prized possessions.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.604
He wouldn't let me near them,
which was fine.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.772
We had vastly different tastes.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.649
I was more of a, well,

08:04.484 --> 08:06.235
Hall & Oates kind of guy, you know?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.114
I think this is the one.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.502
Looks like a chain.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.505
Alice in Chains.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.798
I get it.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.384
But what does it do?

08:31.093 --> 08:33.429
I have no idea.
I've never seen this one before.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.690
Ugh! I'm so hungover.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.946
The Memory Key should've worked on Duncan.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.743
Guess someone's not too concerned
with maintaining her summer bod.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.870
-Clearly.

09:00.122 --> 09:04.252
Maybe it just takes time for things
to click back in place.

09:04.335 --> 09:07.463
I don't get why we just don't take
your little girlfriend

09:07.547 --> 09:09.340
and force her to make the key.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.467
That was your original plan, wasn't it?

09:13.511 --> 09:15.888
Not all Lockes can make keys.

09:15.972 --> 09:16.847
Oh.

09:17.515 --> 09:21.310
Great that you spent the entire summer
getting close to her, then.

09:23.312 --> 09:26.065
-Smaller bites, Eden!

09:27.108 --> 09:28.985
Smaller bites. Chew your food.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.779
I'm not gonna waste
our last piece of Whispering Iron

09:31.862 --> 09:34.156
when we know
that Duncan can make the keys.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.449
He's the sure thing.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.451
Hey, guys?

09:37.535 --> 09:40.496
A small artifact
was taken from my apartment.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.541
-It was in my desk.
-You mean that small musket ball thingy?

09:44.375 --> 09:47.086
You three were there that night.
Did you see anyone take it?

09:47.169 --> 09:50.590
Did you, uh… Did you see anyone
rummaging around my office?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.800
-Um, nah, man.
-No, sorry, Mr. Bennett.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.385
Ask around.

09:54.468 --> 09:59.265
I'm gonna give whoever played this prank
the opportunity to un-play it,

09:59.849 --> 10:01.392
no questions asked.

10:02.226 --> 10:06.439
The artifact has personal significance
to me, and I'd like it back immediately.

10:10.985 --> 10:14.155
-Think he knows it's Whispering Iron?
-I don't see how he could.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.324
Why would he make a big deal out of it?

10:16.407 --> 10:17.241
Eden!

10:18.117 --> 10:19.368
Shit.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.331
-Do you know-- Who is that?
-Mom!

10:23.414 --> 10:27.877
Still unwilling to meet me halfway
in any regard, I see.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.254
You are here. Why are you here?

10:30.796 --> 10:33.883
I'm heading to Nantucket for the weekend,

10:33.966 --> 10:37.219
and I thought I'd swing by
for Winter Fest.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.932
-Hello, I'm Carol.
-Hi. Gabe. Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.100
Where's Dad?

10:43.184 --> 10:44.685
He couldn't make it.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.146
He's at a golf tournament in Florida.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.566
I'm excited
to take a stroll around my old campus.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.110
But first,
we're gonna get you freshened up.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.154
Maybe locate a hairbrush?

10:55.237 --> 10:56.947
Actually, Gabe and I have a--

10:57.031 --> 10:58.824
No! Don't worry about it. Have fun.

10:59.825 --> 11:00.701
Come on.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.373
You sure you're up for this?

11:07.291 --> 11:08.417
I have to be.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.587
Gabe would definitely be suspicious
if we didn't show.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.091
We just have to try and act
like nothing's changed.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.095
I can tell Jamie, right?

11:20.554 --> 11:22.890
About Gabe and Eden, and--

11:22.973 --> 11:24.517
It's… It's not a good idea.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.894
But she's my friend. I trust her.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.688
If we start telling all our friends,

11:28.771 --> 11:31.524
it'll make Gabe more likely to figure out
that we're onto him.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.360
The fewer people that know,
the safer it is for all of us.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.738
And keep your phone on you, okay?
So we can stay in touch.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.950
You remember the tracking app
that I installed on our phones?

11:41.617 --> 11:44.120
If you can't find somebody, check it.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.665
Got it, bud.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.420
Okay, here we go.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.185
-Ooh, I'm gonna go stick with Mom!

12:14.275 --> 12:15.276
Good luck.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.111
You too.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.003
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.838
Wasn't sure if you'd turn up.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.757
We need to act like everything's normal.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.134
-Right.
-I just don't know if I can do it.

12:40.217 --> 12:43.137
Different than screaming your head off
in a horror film, huh?

12:44.722 --> 12:46.474
I wish I could scream my head off.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.229
Listen, I didn't really have
the chance last night,

12:52.730 --> 12:55.024
but… I just wanted to say thank you.

12:57.693 --> 13:01.155
Look, you would've climbed down
to a giant cosmetic case after me too.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.074
I've no doubt.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.289
-I should probably get to my booth.
-Yeah.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.793
Well, I'm… I'm here.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.587
You know, if… if you need me.

13:21.008 --> 13:24.637
In 1775, British soldiers
were given secret orders

13:24.720 --> 13:28.224
to find and seize Colonial rebel supplies

13:28.307 --> 13:31.101
that were housed throughout Massachusetts.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.103
Uh, but these orders…

13:33.187 --> 13:36.565
these orders did not stay secret
for very long.

13:36.649 --> 13:40.152
I felt like he was a lot better
during practice. How was your weekend?

13:40.903 --> 13:43.155
Oh, uh… fine.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.533
-Kinda boring. How was yours?
-So fun.

13:45.616 --> 13:50.704
My grandma always has ice cream cones
and Magic Shell, like, at her house.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.541
-Hmm, that's cool.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.878
Something wrong?

13:59.255 --> 14:01.048
Oh, nothing.

14:14.770 --> 14:19.024
Ah! Look, Poppy, so pretty!

14:19.108 --> 14:20.109
What do you say?

14:20.192 --> 14:21.110
Thank you.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.237
Of course. Thank you.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.041
-Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.
-It's okay, I got it.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.419
-You got it?
-Yeah.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.629
I guess I'm still a little off.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.884
So, um, is Duncan doing any better?
You never texted me.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.385
There's nothing new to report.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.638
I only saw him for a second
before I left this morning,

14:49.722 --> 14:52.099
but… he didn't seem to be in great shape.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.186
-Maybe it's just gonna take some time.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.730
So what are you doing today?

14:57.813 --> 14:59.523
Did you volunteer to work a booth?

14:59.607 --> 15:02.443
No, I actually thought
I would just come and keep you company.

15:02.526 --> 15:06.238
You know, maybe get my face painted
if there's not an age limit.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.074
I don't know about these butterflies.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.160
I want something
that will make me look hard.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.953
Maybe like a neck tat or something?

15:14.955 --> 15:16.373
I think I can make that happen.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.586
How about this little lobster claw,
in honor of my boy, Nephropida?

15:39.980 --> 15:41.565
This will only hurt a little.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.950
-You wanna grab a snow cone?

15:51.450 --> 15:54.078
Actually, can we go talk for a minute?

15:54.620 --> 15:55.663
Sure.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.167
I've never seen it before.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.128
Maybe Rendell never knew about it either.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.465
It was hidden in one of his tapes.
Alice in Chains.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.177
Hmm, that's very Rendell.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.553
-Mm-hmm.

16:12.346 --> 16:15.808
Well, but if he used it,
he must have kept it to himself.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.061
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

16:19.144 --> 16:23.440
It's weird. I think I always thought
that the keys whispered for a reason,

16:23.524 --> 16:27.027
like, "Hey, you might need me."

16:29.530 --> 16:32.700
But maybe it is just random.

16:37.705 --> 16:38.872
You're heading out?

16:38.956 --> 16:41.875
Yeah. Bank called yesterday.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.920
My trust fund came through.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.755
So where you goin'?

16:47.756 --> 16:51.468
Oh, I was thinking about looking
for a place somewhere up in the mountains.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.971
I always loved going
to the mountains as a kid.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.058
But after last night,
I can't just leave.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.438
You've been trapped
in your head for 20 years, Erin.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.524
You can't stay trapped in Matheson now.

17:05.607 --> 17:09.028
Yeah, but Dodge is out there somewhere,
Duncan, and she's coming after you.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.279
I'll be fine.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.074
I've got my full memory back,
thanks to you.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.827
You deserve to find happiness now.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.288
I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to do that.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.707
This is not your fight, Erin.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.920
Just go someplace beautiful,

17:28.589 --> 17:31.216
and I will come visit you
when this is all over, huh?

17:36.263 --> 17:38.015
Okay. Go.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.673
So how's it look?

18:11.757 --> 18:14.384
-Some of my best work yet.
-Yeah?

18:16.804 --> 18:18.847
So I was just wondering. Um…

18:20.015 --> 18:23.393
You know, is there a chance
that maybe you guys used it wrong?

18:23.477 --> 18:24.311
What?

18:24.812 --> 18:25.729
Memory Key.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.774
I mean, it's just weird
that it worked on your dad

18:28.857 --> 18:31.401
and Erin and Ellie,

18:31.485 --> 18:33.445
but not on Duncan?

18:38.075 --> 18:39.535
I guess it's possible.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.704
We're not exactly experts with it.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.295
So what are you gonna do
if he doesn't get better?

18:50.838 --> 18:53.465
-Is there something else you guys can try?
-I don't know!

18:53.549 --> 18:55.801
Can we just talk about something else?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.348
Look, Kinsey, I know
that this is difficult.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.892
Okay, I know it's a family thing.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.938
But I'm always gonna be here for you.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.941
I just hope that you know that.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.444
Thanks.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.324
Oh, look, guys. Face painting.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.034
-Yeah!
-I gotta get to work.

19:21.618 --> 19:25.247
-See you later?
-Why don't I stick around? Help you out.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.221
So you remember the day we went to Bath?

19:42.514 --> 19:43.557
Yeah.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.519
I mean, pieces of it.

19:47.603 --> 19:52.399
What if I told you that you could get
every single minute of that day back?

19:54.067 --> 19:56.236
Okay, sure.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.655
That'd be nice.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.759
How… How are they doing that?

20:28.352 --> 20:31.313
In a few seconds,
you're gonna forget you even saw this.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.606
Why would I forget?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.609
Because it's magic.

20:36.193 --> 20:41.490
Because you're too old now to remember it.
But I have a way to change that.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.118
This key, this…

20:46.828 --> 20:48.914
this key can make it so you never forget.

20:51.750 --> 20:52.668
What?

20:53.210 --> 20:54.836
We could experience it together.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.923
You just have to give me the okay
to use it.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.346
Is all magic this beautiful?

21:07.349 --> 21:08.517
It can be.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.104
You need to know it, um…

21:14.356 --> 21:16.400
can also be used to do terrible things.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.986
So if I choose to do this…

21:21.321 --> 21:23.323
I would never be able to unsee it?

21:26.410 --> 21:28.996
The beautiful and the terrible things?

21:38.505 --> 21:39.756
Then I don't want it.

21:42.592 --> 21:43.593
Jackie…

21:46.847 --> 21:50.434
There's… There's so much
that's… that's out of our control.

21:50.517 --> 21:54.896
There's so much that's changing,
but this can make it so we don't have to.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.316
Okay, but people
are supposed to change, Tyler.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.069
And this doesn't feel right, it--

22:01.153 --> 22:03.155
-Okay, please, just trust me.
-No!

22:12.372 --> 22:13.415
What are

22:14.958 --> 22:16.418
those little fires?

22:21.882 --> 22:25.344
Were those a part
of Winter Fest?

22:27.346 --> 22:28.180
Yeah.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.266
Yeah, they must have been.

22:33.310 --> 22:39.107
Well, this is our last one,
so we should make the most of it.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.228
Hey, step right up!

23:58.311 --> 24:01.189
My mom always used to say
that carnival games were rigged,

24:01.273 --> 24:04.943
which means my performance
must have been especially impressive.

24:05.026 --> 24:06.528
Uh, you did great.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.155
You wanna do the Snow Maze?

24:09.322 --> 24:12.409
Oh, you go on ahead.
I'll… I'll stay out here.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.829
Okay, what is going on?

24:16.538 --> 24:17.372
What?

24:17.456 --> 24:21.376
You've been acting totally weird all day.
So what is it?

24:22.711 --> 24:24.796
Bode, come on. You know you can trust me.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.964
I know.

24:26.047 --> 24:29.926
I just get claustrophobic
when I go into mazes.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.804
-That's all.
-Uh-huh.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.892
Hey!

24:36.975 --> 24:39.686
You can either tell me what's going on
or do the maze with me.

24:39.769 --> 24:43.565
-So what's it gonna be?
-Jamie, come on. My phone is in there.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.483
Hey!

24:44.983 --> 24:46.693
Hey, Jamie!

24:48.820 --> 24:51.406
-Whoa, hey! Four tickets, please.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.117
What? Just-- Come on.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.245
Okay. Uh, I only have two tickets.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.123
I'm sorry, little Locke,
but I literally only have one job,

25:00.207 --> 25:03.877
and that's to stop skippers
and freeloaders like you from getting in!

25:03.960 --> 25:05.629
Move along, now. Go on.

25:07.631 --> 25:08.632
Uh, Mom!

25:08.715 --> 25:11.051
Quick, can you give me two tickets
to go in the maze?

25:11.134 --> 25:13.303
Okay. Oh, slow down.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.430
I'm sure I've got a couple.

25:16.097 --> 25:17.933
-Ooh. Thank you!

25:18.850 --> 25:21.770
Oh, having fun is such serious business.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.313
-Yes.

25:23.855 --> 25:27.859
So I'm guessing
that this… this isn't a deal-breaker,

25:27.943 --> 25:30.529
or else you would have
said something by now, right?

25:30.612 --> 25:33.615
Is it, uh… Is it weird
that I'm kind of into it?

25:34.324 --> 25:35.492
-No!

25:35.575 --> 25:37.994
-No, not weird at all. It's, um…

25:38.537 --> 25:40.247
Good.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.215
Everything okay?

25:52.425 --> 25:53.301
Uh, yeah.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.262
Yeah, everything's good.

25:55.804 --> 26:00.141
So, you know, I'm sure my… my kids
could keep an eye on Bode and Jamie

26:00.225 --> 26:03.103
if maybe you wanna go grab some dinner?

26:03.812 --> 26:08.233
I would love to,
but I have dorm duty tonight.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.653
-So…
-Oh. I could bring over some takeout.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.738
I also have a stack

26:13.822 --> 26:16.491
of papers as high as my ceiling

26:16.575 --> 26:19.244
that I have to grade,
but I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

26:19.828 --> 26:20.954
Sure!

26:21.788 --> 26:23.999
I guess-- See you tomorrow!

26:43.143 --> 26:45.478
Dear Duncan,
I'm sorry I lied to you

26:45.562 --> 26:48.064
about the Chain Key, but I needed it.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.359
I'm the last remaining Keeper of the Keys.

26:51.443 --> 26:55.280
We're the ones who started all this,
so I'm the one who needs to end it.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.867
I'm gonna get rid of Dodge, for good.

27:10.795 --> 27:11.755
Eden!

27:15.050 --> 27:16.551
I've been looking for you.

27:17.427 --> 27:18.428
At the gin booth?

27:18.511 --> 27:21.431
Oh, if you had an ID, you'd be there too.

27:21.514 --> 27:22.599
That's probably true.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.062
So, Eden,

27:28.188 --> 27:32.192
are there any teachers you want me
to meet or need me to speak to?

27:32.776 --> 27:33.818
I'm good.

27:34.319 --> 27:38.573
I've actually got some stuff to do,
people to see, so…

27:39.199 --> 27:42.285
You're ready to be rid of me.
I understand.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.747
But before I go, there's, um…

27:47.999 --> 27:50.502
there's just something I wanted
to talk to you about.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.005
Your father isn't at a golf tournament.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.131
The truth is…

27:57.133 --> 27:58.760
he's been having an affair.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.306
I found out a couple months ago.
I… I just…

28:05.225 --> 28:06.810
didn't have the heart to tell you.

28:06.893 --> 28:07.811
You should kill him.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.357
-Eden.
-No, I'm serious.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.651
You've been working on your forehand
for decades.

28:14.734 --> 28:17.737
Time to put it to good use.
Invite him over for coffee,

28:17.821 --> 28:20.031
then pound the shit out of him
with your racket

28:20.115 --> 28:22.158
until he's a bloody heap on the ground.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.202
It'll feel so good.

28:24.744 --> 28:25.870
I promise.

28:27.747 --> 28:28.998
Thank you, Eden.

28:30.291 --> 28:31.668
For being there for me.

28:50.770 --> 28:54.315
Hey, do you wanna hang out?
You know, when this is all done?

28:54.399 --> 28:56.151
Uh, let me check in at home.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.445
Um, do you think you could do this ombré?

29:05.160 --> 29:06.077
Uh…

29:07.412 --> 29:08.663
Yeah, sure. Totally!

29:09.456 --> 29:11.750
Let me just mix up a few shades of blue.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.426
You're being very quiet.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.261
You good?

29:24.888 --> 29:25.930
Yeah. I'm great.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.101
Hey, can we talk?

29:31.478 --> 29:32.353
Uh…

29:33.188 --> 29:34.147
Yeah.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.778
Gabe took off.

29:40.361 --> 29:43.406
I turned my back for a second,
and when I looked again, he was gone.

29:43.490 --> 29:44.866
Maybe he just went for a walk.

29:44.949 --> 29:48.244
He hasn't left my side all day
and suddenly leaves without saying a word?

29:51.206 --> 29:53.208
Maybe I said something I shouldn't have.

29:54.417 --> 29:55.710
Can't think of anything.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.713
Hey, it's Bode! Leave a message.

30:00.006 --> 30:01.341
Bode's not picking up.

30:02.425 --> 30:03.593
I don't see him.

30:05.428 --> 30:08.890
It says he's on the south side of campus
near the baseball diamond.

30:09.557 --> 30:11.017
That's where the maze is.

30:14.729 --> 30:17.440
Jack, we're gonna go look for Bode
in the maze.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.566
Okay. Sure.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.490
Bode!

30:27.450 --> 30:28.660
Bode!

30:30.703 --> 30:31.788
Bode!

30:33.289 --> 30:35.542
Jackie? Hey, have you seen Erin?

30:36.125 --> 30:37.168
Um, no, I haven't.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.461
Maybe I beat her here.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.256
Um, what about the kids?
Are they around here?

30:41.339 --> 30:43.883
Tyler and Kinsey went into the maze
to look for Bode.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.009
Maze. Got it.

30:48.930 --> 30:51.099
Can I get a cup of chowder?

30:51.182 --> 30:53.810
And the larger one. The bowl of chowder…

30:55.770 --> 30:56.646
Told ya.

30:56.729 --> 30:58.231
-No problem.
-Great.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.608
-You need anything else?
-No…

31:05.947 --> 31:08.366
Yes, guys, it says four.
It says four right there.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.869
-What is the matter with you?
-Hey! Dude!

31:11.494 --> 31:12.412
Doug!

31:13.246 --> 31:15.248
-All right, but just you.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.878
I'm sorry. Four tickets, please.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.298
-Are you serious?
-Very.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.092
Oh!

31:27.969 --> 31:29.554
Oh my God!

31:30.638 --> 31:31.973
That's not right.

31:42.942 --> 31:45.069
Duncan couldn't have gotten that far.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.659
We should split up. Cover more ground.

31:52.452 --> 31:53.286
Okay.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.546
Bode!

32:07.008 --> 32:08.384
Bode, where are you?

32:09.761 --> 32:10.970
Jamie!

32:12.180 --> 32:13.264
Jamie!

32:32.825 --> 32:34.118
Bode, where are you?

32:34.911 --> 32:36.245
-Bode!
-Bode!

33:04.649 --> 33:05.566
Jamie!

33:06.192 --> 33:07.527
Jamie!

33:11.030 --> 33:14.701
I told you we shouldn't
be in here, and now we're lost!

33:14.784 --> 33:16.452
Thanks a lot, Jamie.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.375
You are so dead! What…?

33:23.084 --> 33:25.336
We've been calling you.
Why haven't you picked up?

33:25.420 --> 33:27.380
I'm sorry. I… I didn't hear it.

33:27.463 --> 33:28.756
What's going on?

33:28.840 --> 33:31.551
-We need to get the hell out of here. Now.
-Come on.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.437
Gabe!

33:43.855 --> 33:45.732
Oh! Hi, Erin.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.735
Kinsey didn't tell me
you were coming to Winter Fest.

33:55.742 --> 33:58.119
-You may have everyone else fooled…

33:58.202 --> 33:59.954
…but I see you.

34:04.625 --> 34:06.127
It's time for you to go.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.673
Back to the well house!

34:12.050 --> 34:13.843
-Back where you came from!

34:23.811 --> 34:24.896
You're welcome.

34:31.903 --> 34:35.031
-Oh, Jesus. Thank God, are you guys okay?
-What are you doing here?

34:35.114 --> 34:37.200
Yeah, it's not safe here.
Gabe might see you.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.242
Erin snuck out.

34:38.326 --> 34:41.204
She's going after Dodge by herself.
We need to find her, now.

34:41.287 --> 34:42.914
This way, come on.

34:50.755 --> 34:51.839
Oh, Vossie.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.637
Lucas, I know you're in there.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.639
I liked you better
when you couldn't speak.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.350
I know you can hear me

35:03.476 --> 35:05.812
and that you remember who you were.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.233
Lucas.

35:15.071 --> 35:16.030
Erin!

35:18.324 --> 35:19.325
Erin?

35:46.644 --> 35:47.812
Goodbye, Erin.

35:50.815 --> 35:51.732
Let's go. Come on.

36:49.415 --> 36:51.751
She waited so long to be free.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.714
I told her that it wasn't her fight.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.675
Then why'd she do it?

37:02.261 --> 37:03.971
She was the only Keeper left.

37:08.434 --> 37:09.769
It's up to us now.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.564
This has to end.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.984
Isn't it obvious to you?

37:17.068 --> 37:19.612
If Erin knew, then they know too.

37:19.695 --> 37:21.906
You really think if Kinsey knew,

37:21.989 --> 37:24.617
she'd be able to sit across from me,
painting butterflies all day?

37:24.700 --> 37:27.203
Well, then explain Duncan.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.956
I saw Duncan use the Anywhere Key.

37:30.039 --> 37:31.499
He remembers magic.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.294
Just face it. You got played.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.299
You wanna repeat that?

37:41.801 --> 37:42.760
No.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.555
I just think
you gotta stop fooling yourself.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.058
Kinsey wouldn't lie to me.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.068
Hey, Kinsey, what's up?

37:59.151 --> 38:01.988
Hey! Sorry,
we lost each other at Winter Fest.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.156
Yeah, me too.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.574
I had to get home because…

38:06.617 --> 38:08.327
Gabe, I have the best news.

38:08.911 --> 38:09.829
What is it?

38:10.329 --> 38:14.000
We don't know how,
but the Memory Key finally worked.

38:16.168 --> 38:17.545
Duncan's fixed.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.966
Wow, so everything just suddenly clicked?

38:22.717 --> 38:24.969
Well,
it came back to him in waves.

38:25.052 --> 38:27.722
But yeah. He remembers everything now.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.182
Kinsey, that's incredible.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.686
I'd love to see it for myself.

38:42.361 --> 38:43.487
Come over tomorrow.
