08:26.047 --> 08:29.134
on a boat. Yeah.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.260
Uh, we're having

08:29.176 --> 08:30.260
a big party.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.594
<i>Neptune's Bride.</i>

08:31.636 --> 08:34.264
Yeah. Champagne,

08:31.636 --> 08:34.264
caviar, what-have-you.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.059
Alright. Good. I'll call you

08:35.765 --> 08:38.059
in the morning. Bye.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.855
Thanks, Jesse. You're not

08:39.936 --> 08:41.855
gonna regret this.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.649
Oh, why would I want to hang out

08:41.896 --> 08:44.649
with a big, beautiful rock star

08:44.691 --> 08:47.319
when I can spend the evening

08:44.691 --> 08:47.319
with Thurston Howell, the third

08:49.070 --> 08:52.157
and Mr. Paul,

08:49.070 --> 08:52.157
the human fish stick?

08:55.660 --> 08:58.913
Ahoy, mateys. There she be.

08:58.955 --> 09:03.918
Neptune's Bride, the finest lady

08:58.955 --> 09:03.918
to sail the seven seas.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.921
Argh. I say

09:03.960 --> 09:06.921
we mount her.

09:08.006 --> 09:11.051
That's board her,

09:08.006 --> 09:11.051
squid head.

09:11.092 --> 09:15.680
Isn't this great? A night

09:11.092 --> 09:15.680
of men doing manly things.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.932
You know, there isn't

09:15.722 --> 09:17.932
a manlier man among men

09:17.974 --> 09:21.019
than the old salty dog

09:17.974 --> 09:21.019
who pilots this vessel.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.688
Old Captain Jack,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.688
where you be?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.982
He be retired. I'm his

09:23.730 --> 09:25.982
granddaughter Caroline.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.527
I'll be your captain

09:26.024 --> 09:28.527
this evening.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.489
Oh, yeah. Men don't

09:29.944 --> 09:32.489
come any manlier.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.617
Okay, so except

09:33.656 --> 09:36.617
for old Captain Caroline

09:36.659 --> 09:38.578
it's boys' night out..

09:38.619 --> 09:40.788
...manly men doing

09:38.619 --> 09:40.788
masculine things.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.168
Jesse.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.421
Roxanna, have mercy.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.089
Come here.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.215
What are you

09:49.130 --> 09:50.215
doing here?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.841
I tracked you down.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.594
I'm going on tour tomorrow,

09:51.883 --> 09:54.594
and I just had to see you.

09:54.635 --> 09:55.887
These are

09:54.635 --> 09:55.887
my backup singers.

09:55.929 --> 09:56.930
I'm Yvonne.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.014
I'm Vega.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.558
I'm happy.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.854
Jesse, this

10:01.809 --> 10:04.854
isn't a yacht.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.565
Oh, yeah,

10:04.896 --> 10:06.565
you're telling me.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.192
Last time I ever rent a yacht

10:06.606 --> 10:09.192
from a guy named Ice Pick.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.070
So what,

10:10.527 --> 10:12.070
there's not a party?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.781
We're here to fish.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.781
There's no party.

10:15.823 --> 10:16.950
There is now.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.452
Yeah, whoo-hoo!

10:19.619 --> 10:21.788
Alright, that's Joey.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.788
This is Danny.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.998
Which one's Yvonne?

10:21.829 --> 10:23.998
Which one's Vega?

10:27.752 --> 10:29.254
[engine revving]

10:29.296 --> 10:31.131
Ah ha ha ha!

10:33.258 --> 10:35.051
Thanks for helping me

10:33.258 --> 10:35.051
with the anchor, Danny.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.345
Oh, Caroline,

10:35.093 --> 10:37.345
I live for this stuff.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.014
Well, take a look at me.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.014
Did I forget anything?

10:40.056 --> 10:43.226
You could be the centerfold

10:40.056 --> 10:43.226
for "Field And Stream".

10:45.604 --> 10:46.563
Excuse me, girls.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.566
Boys, it's time

10:46.605 --> 10:49.566
for fishing.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.277
Oh, boy.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.277
Am I a happy camper.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.738
Okay, Jesse,

10:54.404 --> 10:55.738
what do you want?

10:55.780 --> 10:57.198
I don't care.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.409
You want the Daiwa

10:57.240 --> 10:59.409
lightweight graphite super flex

10:59.451 --> 11:01.578
or the Shimano

10:59.451 --> 11:01.578
triton speed master?

11:01.620 --> 11:03.163
I really don't care.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.831
How could you not care?

11:04.872 --> 11:06.749
The Daiwa

11:04.872 --> 11:06.749
has a 40-pound test

11:06.791 --> 11:08.460
and the Shimano has 50.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.711
I don't care. Give me...

11:08.502 --> 11:10.711
give me the Daiwa.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.756
Ooh, the Daiwa?

11:14.966 --> 11:17.427
In these waters?

11:14.966 --> 11:17.427
Bad choice.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.138
I don't care, give me a worm

11:17.469 --> 11:20.138
and some dental floss.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.641
I'll take

11:21.640 --> 11:22.641
the Shimano.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.434
The hell you will.

11:24.476 --> 11:27.437
No way I'm getting stuck

11:24.476 --> 11:27.437
in these waters with a Daiwa.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.359
Look at this.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.359
I got the Shimano.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.654
The Shimano?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.654
In waters like this?

11:40.450 --> 11:42.076
Look at that.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.912
Full moon.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.833
There was a full moon

11:44.954 --> 11:48.833
the last night we were together.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.460
You remember BSurig sur?

11:50.502 --> 11:52.253
I remember we rented that cabin

11:52.295 --> 11:54.005
and went crazy

11:52.295 --> 11:54.005
in every little room.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.676
Yeah, then we went down to the

11:54.047 --> 11:57.676
beach and we got even crazier.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.718
The seals were

11:57.716 --> 11:59.718
clapping for us.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.561
That's ancient history,

12:04.807 --> 12:07.561
right?

12:07.602 --> 12:09.728
Yeah, it's all

12:07.602 --> 12:09.728
in the past.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.816
Just...a shooting star

12:09.770 --> 12:13.816
that burned itself out.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.528
Nothing but memories.

Well, ladies, how about

12:48.935 --> 12:52.230
a menage-a-fish?

12:53.314 --> 12:56.610
We'd need

12:53.314 --> 12:56.610
a lot more champagne.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.946
Well, you got to admit,

12:56.651 --> 12:59.946
it is kinda sexy out here.

a great spot here.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.091
Oh, yeah.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.091
I'm psyched.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.969
I got my lucky pole,

13:20.133 --> 13:22.969
my lucky hat

13:23.010 --> 13:25.472
my lucky underwear with

13:23.010 --> 13:25.472
little sharks on it.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.308
But I digress.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.184
You're kind of funny.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.437
- Nah.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.437
- Yeah.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.230
- Nah.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.230
- Yeah.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.691
Okay, yeah.

13:36.733 --> 13:40.612
Alright, Joey, it's time for a

13:36.733 --> 13:40.612
fishing lesson from the master.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.821
Alright, Danny,

13:40.654 --> 13:42.821
show me how it's done.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.365
The art of casting

13:44.407 --> 13:46.200
clip back your winder,

13:44.407 --> 13:46.200
keep your thumb on the line

13:46.242 --> 13:48.119
cast forward with a firm,

13:46.242 --> 13:48.119
flowing motion

13:48.161 --> 13:49.996
release your thumb,

13:48.161 --> 13:49.996
and let her go.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.830
Got it.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.832
Clip back your winder,

13:51.872 --> 13:53.832
keep your thumb on the line

13:53.874 --> 13:55.752
cast forward with a firm,

13:53.874 --> 13:55.752
flowing motion

13:55.794 --> 13:57.878
release your thumb,

13:55.794 --> 13:57.878
and let her go.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.020
Oop. Got

14:12.560 --> 14:14.020
another one.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.689
He got, ha ha!

14:15.730 --> 14:17.691
That makes four.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.694
I can't believe

14:17.732 --> 14:20.694
I haven't caught a thing.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.195
This makes

14:20.735 --> 14:22.195
five for us.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.447
Alright.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.447
It's a beauty.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.782
How can this be?

14:25.824 --> 14:28.284
Look what

14:25.824 --> 14:28.284
they're wearing.

14:29.661 --> 14:33.331
Oh, great.

14:29.661 --> 14:33.331
My bait is yawning.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.375
Wake up.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.375
Would you wake up?

14:35.416 --> 14:37.377
Danny,

14:35.416 --> 14:37.377
is something wrong?

14:39.629 --> 14:40.921
Where's the scuba gear?

14:40.963 --> 14:43.717
There's something sinister

14:40.963 --> 14:43.717
going on down there.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.176
You think the fish

14:43.758 --> 14:45.176
have gotten together

14:45.218 --> 14:47.470
and made a group decision

14:45.218 --> 14:47.470
to avoid your hook?

14:48.638 --> 14:50.890
It's the only logical

14:48.638 --> 14:50.890
explanation.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.604
This is so boring, reeling

14:52.600 --> 14:56.604
in fish after fish after fish.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.982
Will you shut up?

15:00.024 --> 15:03.444
You know, I wish we could see

15:00.024 --> 15:03.444
each other more often.

15:03.486 --> 15:06.072
I know. The only time

15:03.486 --> 15:06.072
I see you now is on MTV.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.616
I owe a lot

15:06.113 --> 15:08.616
of my success to you.

15:08.658 --> 15:13.329
Ah. Roxanna, you made it

15:08.658 --> 15:13.329
because you're good.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.040

15:13.371 --> 15:16.040

Yeah. How can

16:10.637 --> 16:14.265
almost fun.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.558
Ahh.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.810
Whoa. Whoa!

16:17.477 --> 16:18.812
Whoa!

16:22.607 --> 16:24.275
I'm coming,

16:22.607 --> 16:24.275
Beanie Boy!

16:31.031 --> 16:32.325
Hold on.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.127
Anybody else want some

16:40.750 --> 16:43.127
more of my halibut

16:43.169 --> 16:46.297
my albacore,

16:43.169 --> 16:46.297
my swordfish?

16:46.339 --> 16:47.590
Shut up.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.260
You're just cranky 'cause you

16:49.091 --> 16:51.260
got pulled overboard

16:51.302 --> 16:53.095
by a Michelin radial.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.976
Hey, that tire had

16:54.555 --> 16:57.976
an incredible will to live.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.603
Hey, Roxanna, we'll meet

16:58.017 --> 17:00.603
you back at the hotel, okay?

17:00.645 --> 17:02.856
Yeah, thanks

17:00.645 --> 17:02.856
for breakfast, guys.

17:05.900 --> 17:09.028
Oh, and thanks for

17:05.900 --> 17:09.028
the Pepto-Bismol.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.071
I know my antacids.

17:11.113 --> 17:14.826
You know, Joey, being with you

17:11.113 --> 17:14.826
actually bordered on fun.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.285
Yeah. I hear that a lot.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.998
You know, Joey,

17:17.745 --> 17:19.998
we've met a lot of men

17:20.039 --> 17:22.959
and, well,

17:20.039 --> 17:22.959
now we've met you.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.714
- Bye-bye.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.714
- Bye.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.550
Seems like we're always

17:27.755 --> 17:30.550
saying goodbye, huh?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.844
I hate it.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.015
Jesse, come on

17:35.179 --> 17:37.015
the road with me.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.642
Join your band?

17:39.684 --> 17:41.060
Well, no.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.603
We're an all-girl group

17:42.645 --> 17:45.732
and you're definitely

17:42.645 --> 17:45.732
not a girl.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.944
Then why would I go

17:47.025 --> 17:49.944
on the road with you?

17:49.986 --> 17:52.112
Just to be with me?

17:53.239 --> 17:56.743
Do what? Carry your

17:53.239 --> 17:56.743
bags for you?

17:56.784 --> 17:58.536
Tune your guitar?

17:56.784 --> 17:58.536
Is that what you want?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.287
I've got nothing better

17:58.578 --> 18:00.287
to do than follow you around

18:00.329 --> 18:02.122
like a little

18:00.329 --> 18:02.122
puppy dog or something?

18:02.164 --> 18:04.000
You know, I really had

18:02.164 --> 18:04.000
a great time.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.167
So did I.

18:06.252 --> 18:10.089
Uh, how about

18:06.252 --> 18:10.089
if I make you dinner?

18:10.130 --> 18:12.299
Uh, dinner?

18:12.341 --> 18:14.343
You know, food you eat

18:12.341 --> 18:14.343
when it gets dark?

18:15.970 --> 18:17.597
No dinner.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.265
How about lunch?

18:19.306 --> 18:22.018
No, no lunch,

18:19.306 --> 18:22.018
no food.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.353
Liquid protein?

18:24.395 --> 18:28.983
Uh, look, Caroline, uh,

18:24.395 --> 18:28.983
I'm real sorry, but..

18:29.025 --> 18:31.986
...I think this whole thing

18:29.025 --> 18:31.986
was just kind of a big mistake.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.615
You-you really shouldn't

18:33.237 --> 18:35.615
be here right now

18:35.656 --> 18:38.534
because, uh, you really

18:35.656 --> 18:38.534
should be somewhere else.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.121
Let me walk you

18:39.869 --> 18:42.121
to the door, okay?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.290
Jesse, you're

18:43.122 --> 18:44.290
overreacting.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.666
No, I'm not.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.666
I'm not overreacting.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.044
Come on, let's go.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.044
This is not gonna work out.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.337
Go be a big star,

18:48.086 --> 18:50.337
get in your limousine.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.381
Alright,

18:50.379 --> 18:52.381
everybody freeze.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.175
I need to see Jesse and Danny

18:52.423 --> 18:55.175
in the kitchen right now.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.761
Joey, I'm in the middle

18:55.217 --> 18:56.761
of something.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.429
Humor me.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.390
Girls, look,

19:00.014 --> 19:01.390
please don't leave.

19:01.432 --> 19:05.227
Caroline, you like fish.

19:01.432 --> 19:05.227
Roxanna, you like music.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.980
Talk about Muddy Waters.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.776
Joey, what is

19:09.523 --> 19:11.776
your problem?

19:14.528 --> 19:16.572
You guys are crazy.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.198
You had a nice time

19:16.614 --> 19:18.198
with Caroline

19:18.240 --> 19:19.742
you had a nice time

19:18.240 --> 19:19.742
with Roxanna.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.786
What's the story here?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.454
Caroline and I are

19:21.828 --> 19:23.454
none of your business.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.665
Right. Neither are Roxanna

19:23.496 --> 19:25.665
and I . Thanks, Joey.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.416
Jesse?

19:27.458 --> 19:28.918
Your attitude wouldn't

19:27.458 --> 19:28.918
have anything to do

19:28.960 --> 19:30.086
with her

19:28.960 --> 19:30.086
success, would it?

19:30.128 --> 19:31.295
No.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.008
I don't know.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.385
Alright,

19:36.801 --> 19:38.385
I do know.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.014
I mean..

19:41.055 --> 19:42.389
...I put her band

19:41.055 --> 19:42.389
together, me.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.142
I put the band together,

19:42.431 --> 19:44.142
she's a big star.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.644
I put my band together,

19:44.183 --> 19:46.644
we're playing dives.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.855
I promised myself,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.855
by the time I was 24

19:48.896 --> 19:50.606
I'm gonna have

19:48.896 --> 19:50.606
a record deal.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.900
I'm 24 1/2.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.568
When's it gonna be my turn?

19:55.778 --> 19:58.364
Hey, I know

19:55.778 --> 19:58.364
how that feels.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.575
It's like when I

19:58.405 --> 20:01.575
see Alf, I go nuts.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.587
I'm doing my standup

20:11.251 --> 20:13.587
in little nightclubs

20:13.629 --> 20:16.757
and a carpet sample

20:13.629 --> 20:16.757
as a series.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.805
But, you know,

20:20.469 --> 20:22.805
if we hang in there

20:22.847 --> 20:24.015
we're going to make it.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.354
Danny, why are you

20:27.727 --> 20:30.354
so upset with Caroline?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.818
'Cause she wanted

20:33.440 --> 20:35.818
to make me dinner.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.945
The real problem

20:35.860 --> 20:37.945
is you like her.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.407
Okay, I do like her.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.410
And it scares me.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.454
Ever since Pam..

20:49.373 --> 20:51.291
...everything

20:49.373 --> 20:51.291
is just so hard

20:51.333 --> 20:52.877
so confusing.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.463
I know how tough

20:54.170 --> 20:56.463
this has been on you.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.551
That's how life is.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.551
It's a struggle.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.138
What helps you get through

21:02.428 --> 21:04.138
the tough times

21:04.180 --> 21:06.015
are the people

21:04.180 --> 21:06.015
by your side.

21:08.059 --> 21:12.855
So when people like Roxanna

21:08.059 --> 21:12.855
and Caroline come along

21:12.897 --> 21:14.398
why push them away

21:14.440 --> 21:17.317
because you're frustrated

21:14.440 --> 21:17.317
with your career and..

21:17.359 --> 21:19.486
...because you're

21:17.359 --> 21:19.486
not ready to date yet?

21:21.697 --> 21:25.451
You're throwing away

21:21.697 --> 21:25.451
what could be great friendships.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.203
Is this the same guy

21:25.492 --> 21:27.203
who spends hours

21:27.245 --> 21:28.913
perfecting underarm noises?

21:34.919 --> 21:36.837
Where is this

21:34.919 --> 21:36.837
coming from?

21:39.673 --> 21:41.508
From my heart.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.181
I did have some help

21:44.470 --> 21:47.181
with the words.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.600
It's what Scooby-Doo told

21:47.223 --> 21:49.600
Scrappy-Doo

21:49.642 --> 21:51.518
last Saturday morning.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.110
Thanks, Joey.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.489
Oh..

22:07.201 --> 22:09.328
Come here,

22:07.201 --> 22:09.328
you big goof.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.542
Alright.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.753
We got in some

22:15.584 --> 22:17.753
male bonding after all.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.591
Will you guys excuse me

22:20.047 --> 22:22.591
for a moment?

22:26.929 --> 22:29.473
Caroline, could I

22:26.929 --> 22:29.473
talk to you, please?

22:34.854 --> 22:37.564
- Hi.

22:38.691 --> 22:42.820
Look, uh, I'm real sorry

22:38.691 --> 22:42.820
I flipped out.

22:42.862 --> 22:46.115
It's just that, uh..

22:46.157 --> 22:47.449
...well, you know

22:46.157 --> 22:47.449
about my wife.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.996
And, uh, I'm just not

22:48.742 --> 22:51.996
ready for this yet.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.498
I really do like you.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.169
Do you think maybe..

22:58.211 --> 23:01.881
...you and I could,

22:58.211 --> 23:01.881
like, just be friends?

23:01.922 --> 23:04.091
I think that

23:01.922 --> 23:04.091
would be great.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.555
Oh.

23:09.596 --> 23:12.808
Roxanna, I guess what

23:09.596 --> 23:12.808
I'm trying to say is..

23:12.850 --> 23:16.436
...maybe I was acting

23:12.850 --> 23:16.436
a little bit..

23:16.478 --> 23:17.813
...what's the word

23:16.478 --> 23:17.813
I'm looking for?

23:17.855 --> 23:19.273
Insanely jealous.

23:20.566 --> 23:23.652
Jesse, your time's

23:20.566 --> 23:23.652
gonna to come.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.988
You're too good.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.116
You know I can't

23:27.198 --> 23:29.116
go with you.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.118
I know.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.913
I just want us

23:32.245 --> 23:33.913
to be together.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.916
Well, maybe someday

23:33.954 --> 23:36.916
we will be

23:36.957 --> 23:42.504
but in the meantime, you got

23:36.957 --> 23:42.504
to realize a guy like me..

23:42.546 --> 23:44.798
...I got to be

23:42.546 --> 23:44.798
free-wheeling.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.467
I got to be

23:44.840 --> 23:47.467
riding on the wind.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.970
I got to be

23:47.509 --> 23:49.970
living on the edge.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.515
Hi, Uncle Jesse.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.601
Will you help me off

23:53.557 --> 23:55.601
with my stinger?

23:55.642 --> 23:57.395
Sure, kid.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.733
Well, I'm living

23:59.939 --> 24:02.733
on the edge of cuteness.
