WEBVTT

00:00.368 --> 00:02.000
(Birds chirp)

00:10.710 --> 00:12.943
- No, no, no! No, no, no!

00:12.945 --> 00:15.378
- No! Noooo!
- What?

00:15.380 --> 00:17.747
- My bag! It's gone!
- What bag?

00:17.749 --> 00:20.349
- My brown bag!
- What brown bag?

00:20.351 --> 00:21.717
You had a room full
of brown bags back home,

00:21.719 --> 00:23.385
which brown bag?!

00:23.387 --> 00:26.121
- My crocodile bag,
the one my mother gave me!

00:26.123 --> 00:28.756
- Oh, it's in the closet,
next to my briefcase.

00:28.758 --> 00:31.692
- That's an ostrich bag.

00:31.694 --> 00:34.995
(Hyperventilating,
then agonized shriek)

00:34.997 --> 00:36.096
- Okay, just calm down,
breathe, breathe.

00:36.098 --> 00:38.331
Breathe... breathe!

00:38.333 --> 00:40.900
- Okay... David!

00:40.902 --> 00:44.637
David must've taken it, along
with my last molecule of hope!

00:44.639 --> 00:47.506
(Knock on door)
- Oh Moira, David only took his own bags.

00:47.508 --> 00:49.140
- Are you kidding?!
I bet he's pawned it by now,

00:49.142 --> 00:51.108
to pay for manicures.

00:51.110 --> 00:52.509
- What possible sense would
it make for David

00:52.511 --> 00:53.843
to take one of your bags?

00:53.845 --> 00:56.345
It doesn't-- Oh towels, great.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.613
- Mrs. Rose, you got out
of bed.

00:58.615 --> 01:01.282
- Humph!

01:01.284 --> 01:03.183
- Sorry, am I interrupting
something?

01:03.185 --> 01:04.884
- No, no, we're just,
we're looking for

01:04.886 --> 01:06.619
something valuable, and um...

01:06.621 --> 01:08.454
- Your son?
- Well, no,

01:08.456 --> 01:09.822
a brown bag,
as a matter of fact.

01:09.824 --> 01:13.058
Well... our son, yes.

01:13.060 --> 01:15.393
- Has anyone heard from David?

01:15.395 --> 01:17.061
- Oh, to be so naive!

01:17.063 --> 01:18.595
He's long gone, darling,

01:18.597 --> 01:20.964
escaped, and left us all behind.

01:20.966 --> 01:22.865
- Okay, well uh...

01:22.867 --> 01:24.833
I've put in some calls
to some people,

01:24.835 --> 01:27.268
just to get the word out.

01:27.270 --> 01:29.370
- Well, that's very nice.

01:29.372 --> 01:31.238
That's very nice, Stevie,
thank you very much.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.640
That's very considerate,

01:33.642 --> 01:36.809
because I know you
and David had a...

01:36.811 --> 01:38.777
intimate uh, relationship.

01:38.779 --> 01:40.745
Okay, I just came
to drop off the towels,

01:40.747 --> 01:42.213
and check in, so.

01:42.215 --> 01:44.481
ALEXIS: Is that Stevie?

01:44.483 --> 01:47.484
Can you ask her if she has any
extra bedspreads?

01:47.486 --> 01:50.053
- I'm still here!

01:50.055 --> 01:53.322
ALEXIS: Oh! Okay, then come
here then, please, for a sec?

01:53.324 --> 01:54.789
- Yeah, um, come in.

01:57.560 --> 01:58.659
(Door thuds shut)

02:00.596 --> 02:01.227
(Bed rattles)

02:05.299 --> 02:08.667
- Hey, does this place have
any king sized sheets?

02:08.669 --> 02:11.236
- Alexis, what the hell
are you doing?!

02:11.238 --> 02:13.671
- Just giving myself
some more space.

02:13.673 --> 02:16.640
There's a lot going on
in my life right now.

02:16.642 --> 02:18.875
Like, Ted keeps harassing me
for an answer

02:18.877 --> 02:21.911
to the whole, am I
gonna marry him thing,

02:21.913 --> 02:23.746
and then there's the whole
Mutt issue,

02:23.748 --> 02:26.215
which is very complicated,
and sexy,

02:26.217 --> 02:28.150
so I'm just, I don't know
what to do.

02:28.152 --> 02:30.152
- I take it you haven't
heard from David.

02:30.154 --> 02:32.187
- Okay, yeah, fine.

02:32.189 --> 02:34.322
And David's missing. So...

02:35.658 --> 02:39.859
♪♪

02:41.529 --> 02:45.130
- Yeah, well, he's missing.

02:45.132 --> 02:49.634
Well, I can't find him,
so what would you say he is?

02:49.636 --> 02:51.168
Okay, you know what?
You know what?!

02:51.170 --> 02:52.502
I don't think your mother
would appreciate you

02:52.504 --> 02:54.570
speaking to me in that way!

02:57.508 --> 03:01.609
Well, I'm-I'm sorry
for your loss.

03:01.611 --> 03:04.178
MOIRA: Oh! What'd they say!

03:04.180 --> 03:06.146
JOHNNY: Nothing, and I'm getting
nervous, Moira.

03:06.148 --> 03:08.581
- Don't worry, he's fine.

03:08.583 --> 03:10.082
It's not the first time
David's run away,

03:10.084 --> 03:11.950
Remember all those troubled
years in high school,

03:11.952 --> 03:14.385
when he'd charter the jet
without permission?

03:14.387 --> 03:16.186
- Yes, but he has no money.

03:16.188 --> 03:17.820
- Oh, he does now.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.254
If there's one thing David
knows,

03:19.256 --> 03:22.190
it's the street value
of a woman's bag.

03:22.192 --> 03:23.925
- Okay, you know what, can we
stop talking about that bag

03:23.927 --> 03:26.961
for five minutes, the bag,
the bag, and the bag!

03:26.963 --> 03:29.129
- John, it's an heirloom,
my great grandmother took it

03:29.131 --> 03:31.231
from her husband when she left
him,

03:31.233 --> 03:33.132
and it has been passed down
through all the women

03:33.134 --> 03:36.301
in my family, as emergency
currency,

03:36.303 --> 03:37.435
in case we need to leave
our husbands

03:37.437 --> 03:38.502
in the middle of the night.

03:38.504 --> 03:41.137
- Oh, well, that's reassuring.

03:41.139 --> 03:41.871
- You don't have to worry
darling,

03:41.873 --> 03:43.472
I'll never need it.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.173
But you know Alexis will!

03:45.175 --> 03:47.008
Yeah, more than once,
probably.

03:47.010 --> 03:49.810
- I love that bag.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.778
And I've kept it safe
all these years.

03:51.780 --> 03:54.080
And now John, it's out there,

03:54.082 --> 03:56.015
- Frightened, and alone--
- Okay, okay.

03:56.017 --> 03:58.717
- We'll find it,
we'll find your bag.

03:58.719 --> 04:00.952
- We'll find your bag, Moira.
- Oh, we better, please!

04:00.954 --> 04:01.819
- Yes, we will.
- Please!

04:09.561 --> 04:10.560
(Saw rasps)

04:17.634 --> 04:20.267
- Hey, uh, I really shouldn't
come in.

04:20.269 --> 04:21.534
- Actually, you're standing
in my living room,

04:21.536 --> 04:23.969
- you let yourself in.
- Yeah, no, I know.

04:23.971 --> 04:26.371
Um, so, about the other
night...

04:26.373 --> 04:28.873
- Uh huh.
- Oh! Mm!

04:28.875 --> 04:32.109
That night. Um...
That was super fun.

04:32.111 --> 04:33.143
- I'd say it was the most
fun I had all year.

04:33.145 --> 04:35.578
- Yeah, it was super fun.

04:35.580 --> 04:36.579
- Actually, I wouldn't mind
having a little more fun,

04:36.581 --> 04:38.981
- right now.
- Okay...

04:38.983 --> 04:41.583
- And I love hearing
you say that.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.785
It's just that,
when we got together,

04:43.787 --> 04:46.254
um, I thought my family
was leaving.

04:46.256 --> 04:50.390
- Uh huh.
- And now we're not. So...

04:50.392 --> 04:51.591
- I would love to feel
worse about your parents

04:51.593 --> 04:53.559
not selling the town, but...

04:53.561 --> 04:55.527
- Hmm, it's just, it's so
tragic,

04:55.529 --> 04:58.162
'cause my mom is in this
like, waking coma,

04:58.164 --> 04:59.963
and my dad has developed
more of a stutter,

04:59.965 --> 05:01.864
and uh, because we're
not leaving,

05:04.301 --> 05:07.001
things are a little bit
complicated with Ted.

05:10.272 --> 05:12.071
- I thought things were done
with Ted.

05:12.073 --> 05:14.373
- Me too.

05:14.375 --> 05:17.075
But apparently, he was
misinformed.

05:17.077 --> 05:18.976
- By who?
- By me.

05:21.246 --> 05:23.212
- Okay.

05:23.214 --> 05:25.714
- Until that whole thing
kinda works itself out,

05:25.716 --> 05:28.383
I have a moral obligation
to Ted.

05:28.385 --> 05:31.486
You hands are so...

05:31.488 --> 05:33.988
soft for someone who does
nothing but manual labour.

05:33.990 --> 05:35.422
- Thanks, I make sure
to moisturize.

05:35.424 --> 05:37.390
- Mm, that's so important.
So important.

05:42.063 --> 05:43.762
- Listen... I can wait.

05:46.066 --> 05:48.099
Thank you.

05:48.101 --> 05:49.133
- Uh huh.
- So um...

05:51.604 --> 05:53.437
So, you look really good today.

06:00.378 --> 06:01.677
(Knocking)

06:05.181 --> 06:08.282
- Oh, hello, Roses.

06:08.284 --> 06:09.549
What, are you here to tell me
Alexis has skipped town

06:09.551 --> 06:11.684
with my lawn mower?!

06:11.686 --> 06:13.952
- Roland, these people have
literally hit rock bottom,

06:13.954 --> 06:15.520
they're not in the mood
for your jokes right now.

06:15.522 --> 06:18.189
- She is.

06:18.191 --> 06:19.657
- Look, I've been on the phone
all morning

06:19.659 --> 06:21.225
with missing persons,
and just wondering

06:21.227 --> 06:22.793
if you've heard anything?

06:22.795 --> 06:24.661
- No. Come in, come on in.

06:27.866 --> 06:31.167
I can't imagine the stress
of losing a child.

06:31.169 --> 06:34.003
- Oh, I haven't lost him,
I know exactly where he is.

06:34.005 --> 06:36.071
He's enjoying happy hour
at the Viceroy without me.

06:36.073 --> 06:39.074
- It's been three days
without any contact.

06:39.076 --> 06:40.742
- Johnny, you wouldn't
know this,

06:40.744 --> 06:44.045
but statistics tell us
you have a 48 hour window

06:44.047 --> 06:46.914
before you can assume
somebody is dead.

06:46.916 --> 06:51.084
- Yeah, I just said
it's been three days.

06:51.086 --> 06:53.119
- Then do we call off
the search?

06:53.121 --> 06:54.520
- Oh my God!

06:54.522 --> 06:56.120
(Phone rings)
- I'll get it.

06:58.624 --> 07:01.458
Roland Schitt.

07:01.460 --> 07:03.593
Yes.

07:03.595 --> 07:05.494
Yes!

07:05.496 --> 07:06.561
Yes!

07:08.064 --> 07:09.863
Oh-oh. Okay.

07:09.865 --> 07:13.333
Uh-huh, yeah.

07:13.335 --> 07:15.501
I'm good, how about you?

07:15.503 --> 07:16.934
Terrific. Great, where?

07:19.104 --> 07:21.871
Uh-huh.
Uhhhh-huh!

07:21.873 --> 07:23.739
I got it, great, we'll see you
there this afternoon.

07:23.741 --> 07:27.008
Bye. Well, good news, folks!

07:27.010 --> 07:28.175
They found the truck.

07:28.177 --> 07:29.776
- And David.

07:32.647 --> 07:35.681
- Well, that didn't come up.
- Well, didn't you ask?

07:35.683 --> 07:36.782
- Johnny, they were all
excited about telling me

07:36.784 --> 07:38.750
they found the truck, so...

07:38.752 --> 07:39.650
- Call him back!
- Call him back. Now!

07:39.652 --> 07:41.818
- Call him back!

07:41.820 --> 07:43.953
- Well, I- I don't have the
number, I've got the address.

07:43.955 --> 07:47.957
- I'm sure David is with
the truck, right, Roland?

07:47.959 --> 07:48.824
- Well, I think they would've
told me if there's a dead body

07:48.826 --> 07:50.692
with the truck, honey.

07:50.694 --> 07:54.661
- Oh!
- Just give us the address!

07:54.663 --> 07:56.129
Give me the address!

07:58.399 --> 08:00.499
- Did they mention bags?
- Well, no talk of bags.

08:00.501 --> 08:01.666
- Were there bags in the truck?

08:05.104 --> 08:06.103
- My best friend
in kindergarten ran away,

08:06.105 --> 08:08.572
and her parents didn't notice,

08:08.574 --> 08:09.673
and she ended up getting
adopted by this really rich

08:09.675 --> 08:11.207
Asian family in Vancouver,

08:11.209 --> 08:12.775
but then they had their own kid,

08:12.777 --> 08:14.343
so she kind of got neglected
a bit,

08:14.345 --> 08:15.444
and I can't remember
whether she's back

08:15.446 --> 08:16.812
on the streets now, or...

08:16.814 --> 08:18.413
- You know, and he took
his hair straightener,

08:18.415 --> 08:20.982
which he knows that I use
more than he does.

08:20.984 --> 08:23.117
This whole thing is just
very selfish.

08:23.119 --> 08:25.152
- Alexis!

08:25.154 --> 08:26.953
Ted! Oh my god, hi.

08:28.923 --> 08:31.823
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:31.825 --> 08:35.993
- Um... I've been calling.

08:35.995 --> 08:37.594
- I know, I know. But
everything's just been so hectic,

08:37.596 --> 08:39.796
what with David missing,

08:39.798 --> 08:41.297
and like, I haven't been
sleeping,

08:41.299 --> 08:42.331
And I haven't been
eating, and--

08:42.333 --> 08:44.599
- You just ordered the parfait.

08:44.601 --> 08:47.401
- And I just keep picturing
him at the bottom of a lake.

08:47.403 --> 08:49.736
- Oh, no, that guy was like,
a known alcoholic,

08:49.738 --> 08:52.572
and they pulled him out
a week ago.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.540
- Thank God you're here!

08:54.542 --> 08:56.975
- Of course, I've been trying
to be here more for you,

08:56.977 --> 08:59.610
but I guess my texts haven't
been getting through,

08:59.612 --> 09:01.445
or maybe I'm sending them wrong?

09:03.015 --> 09:06.182
- That's so sweet.

09:06.184 --> 09:08.651
- Uh, here.

09:08.653 --> 09:10.019
Listen.

09:13.624 --> 09:15.857
I don't want to apply any
pressure

09:15.859 --> 09:17.825
to the whole marriage
thing, but--

09:17.827 --> 09:19.426
- Thank you, Ted,
'cause it's so hard to focus

09:19.428 --> 09:21.528
on something like that
right now.

09:21.530 --> 09:23.563
- And I totally understand that.

09:23.565 --> 09:26.299
It's just... you had said that
you wanted

09:26.301 --> 09:29.168
to get married if you
weren't leaving town,

09:29.170 --> 09:31.603
and you didn't leave town, so...

09:31.605 --> 09:33.137
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

09:33.139 --> 09:36.607
And I totally get that.

09:36.609 --> 09:40.010
Technically though,
someone did leave,

09:40.012 --> 09:41.344
And so the dust just
hasn't really settled

09:41.346 --> 09:43.746
on the whole...
us leaving thing.

09:43.748 --> 09:46.949
- Yet.
- Right.

09:46.951 --> 09:50.818
- But obviously I want
to be with you!

09:50.820 --> 09:52.953
I'm just so scared.

09:57.091 --> 09:57.789
- What, about David,
or about being with--

09:57.791 --> 09:59.357
- Yeah, that.

10:02.395 --> 10:06.563
- All we know is the truck ran
out of gas on an Amish farm.

10:06.565 --> 10:09.332
- So David has been living on
an Amish farm for three days?

10:09.334 --> 10:12.301
- We think so.

10:12.303 --> 10:13.468
- I really hope you're right.

10:13.470 --> 10:15.636
- Stevie dear,

10:15.638 --> 10:16.937
Now don't take this
the wrong way,

10:16.939 --> 10:19.172
but, is this car your home?

10:19.174 --> 10:22.408
- Excuse me?

10:22.410 --> 10:25.244
I take it you're finished
with this sandwich.

10:25.246 --> 10:27.813
- Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

10:27.815 --> 10:30.382
Oh yeah! Um, but there's donuts
under the seat,

10:30.384 --> 10:33.051
those are still good.

10:33.053 --> 10:34.852
- Oh.

10:34.854 --> 10:36.987
- Okay. (Horn honks)

10:39.925 --> 10:41.658
- Alexis, we think we found
your brother!

10:41.660 --> 10:43.126
Come on!

10:45.363 --> 10:48.030
- I'm just super tired
from walking, though.

10:53.036 --> 10:55.369
- Babe, you're tired because
you were stressed about David,

10:55.371 --> 10:57.404
but they found him,
you should go.

10:57.406 --> 11:00.206
JOHNNY: Alexis!
(Honks horn)

11:00.208 --> 11:02.341
- I know!

11:10.083 --> 11:12.883
(Car rumbles)

11:12.885 --> 11:14.951
MOIRA: This is exactly what
David wants.

11:14.953 --> 11:16.485
All of us worried,
and driving around

11:16.487 --> 11:17.986
in some tin can looking
for him.

11:17.988 --> 11:20.488
It's a tactic. It's subterfuge.

11:20.490 --> 11:22.857
- Oh, you could be jumping
to conclusions, Moira.

11:22.859 --> 11:24.859
- I taught him everything
he knows.

11:24.861 --> 11:25.726
He shouldn't have left me
behind,

11:25.728 --> 11:27.494
that was never part of the plan.

11:27.496 --> 11:29.395
- Oh my God,
ever since David left,

11:29.397 --> 11:31.897
you two have been so dramatic.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.531
Do I have to remind you
of the time

11:33.533 --> 11:35.666
that I was taken hostage
on David Geffen's yacht

11:35.668 --> 11:37.668
by Somali pirates for a week,

11:37.670 --> 11:40.203
and nobody answered my texts?!

11:40.205 --> 11:41.737
- I had just had my eyelashes
dyed,

11:41.739 --> 11:43.672
everything was cloudy!

11:43.674 --> 11:46.908
- Okay, can we all focus here?
For a moment?!

11:46.910 --> 11:50.611
David has spent the last
three days on a farm.

11:50.613 --> 11:52.446
With the Amish!

11:55.684 --> 11:56.516
(Sighs)

11:58.586 --> 12:00.686
(Car rumbles,
tires crunch on grovel)

12:06.527 --> 12:07.792
(Doors open and shut)

12:12.798 --> 12:14.063
ALEXIS: Ugh!

12:17.401 --> 12:18.733
(Footsteps crunch)

12:23.139 --> 12:24.238
- Oh!

12:26.342 --> 12:28.308
Thank God.

12:28.310 --> 12:30.009
- David!

12:30.011 --> 12:32.644
JOHNNY: David!

12:32.646 --> 12:34.379
- David, I'm here!

12:34.381 --> 12:35.613
- David, it's us!

12:37.316 --> 12:39.182
- I know!

12:39.184 --> 12:41.484
- David, come here, please!

12:41.486 --> 12:44.153
- Stop yelling, "David!"
You come here!

12:44.155 --> 12:46.088
- We've come to take you home!

12:46.090 --> 12:47.722
Three days later!

12:47.724 --> 12:49.523
- Nobody knew where you were!

12:49.525 --> 12:51.424
And your phone was off!

12:51.426 --> 12:53.091
- I texted Alexis!

12:55.929 --> 12:57.662
- Wha-I'm sorry for not
responding to like,

12:57.664 --> 13:01.098
one text, David!

13:01.100 --> 13:05.868
- I was worried sick, dear!
"Where's David, or his bags?"

13:05.870 --> 13:07.936
- David?
- What?!

13:07.938 --> 13:10.939
- Okay, you remember Mutt?
- Yeah!

13:10.941 --> 13:13.041
- Okay, it's gotten more
complicated!

13:13.043 --> 13:15.209
- What happened?

13:15.211 --> 13:18.278
- We slept together!
- Ooh...

13:18.280 --> 13:22.281
- Okay Alexis, we can talk
about this on the ride home.

13:22.283 --> 13:25.250
David, let us help you
with your bags!

13:25.252 --> 13:28.319
- What if I'm not ready
to come home?!

13:28.321 --> 13:30.521
- There's a bug on your dress.
- Ew! (Bleep)

13:30.523 --> 13:31.722
Ugh! Oh!

13:37.563 --> 13:40.931
(Footsteps thud)

13:40.933 --> 13:44.100
DAVID: Miriam makes the most
delicious butter.

13:44.102 --> 13:46.769
Yeah, I mean, she starts
pounding that cream

13:46.771 --> 13:48.804
about a half hour too early
in the morning,

13:48.806 --> 13:50.872
but it tastes exactly like
the butter we had

13:50.874 --> 13:52.473
at the Ritz in Paris,
you know, that sort of...

13:52.475 --> 13:55.108
salt-less butter.

13:55.110 --> 13:57.977
- Well, once again, thank you
for nurturing our David

13:57.979 --> 14:00.846
during such a difficult time.

14:00.848 --> 14:04.149
- Well, we should be
thanking you for coming.

14:04.151 --> 14:05.717
We've spent two sleepless
nights,

14:05.719 --> 14:07.285
wondering what would happen
if nobody came.

14:07.287 --> 14:10.521
Would we be stuck with him?!

14:10.523 --> 14:13.991
- Oh, my baby!
Thank you, thank you!

14:13.993 --> 14:15.959
I would give you a gratuity,
but...

14:15.961 --> 14:18.461
I'm short about a million
this week.

14:18.463 --> 14:21.764
- David's stay here has taught
us some valuable lessons

14:21.766 --> 14:26.301
in patience, forgiveness--
- Restraint.

14:26.303 --> 14:28.636
(Moira clears her throat)

14:28.638 --> 14:32.339
- Well it seems you've taken very
good care of our possessions,

14:32.341 --> 14:35.508
I hope it wasn't too much
of an imposition.

14:35.510 --> 14:38.577
- You know, I'm not sure I'm
even ready to come home yet.

14:38.579 --> 14:41.046
- And yet your time with us
has come to an end.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.114
- Okay.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.748
- These three days you spent
with us David,

14:44.750 --> 14:46.850
will remain in our memories
for many days,

14:46.852 --> 14:49.419
and many, many, many nights.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.821
- Thank you for your kindness,

14:51.823 --> 14:55.024
when no one else showed me
kindness.

14:55.026 --> 14:57.259
And compassion,
when no one else showed--

14:57.261 --> 14:59.361
JOHNNY: Excuse me son, uh...

14:59.363 --> 15:02.731
I imagine it's customary
for strangers to partake

15:02.733 --> 15:05.133
in a good, old fashioned
Amish lunch?

15:05.135 --> 15:07.135
- Not always.

15:07.137 --> 15:09.170
Have a safe trip.

15:09.172 --> 15:11.572
- Oh! Okay.

15:11.574 --> 15:15.475
Thank you. Thanks.

15:15.477 --> 15:17.610
JOHNNY: Yeah, thank-thank you.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.645
- Where are we?

15:19.647 --> 15:21.813
(Truck rumbles)

15:25.585 --> 15:28.619
- Do you know how many times
I've had to apologize to Roland?

15:28.621 --> 15:30.887
You can't just leave with
other people's trucks, David!

15:30.889 --> 15:33.389
What were you thinking?

15:33.391 --> 15:38.193
- What you did was impulsive,
Capricious and melodramatic.

15:38.195 --> 15:40.028
But it was also wrong.

15:40.030 --> 15:42.597
- Okay, nobody freaked out
when Alexis went missing!

15:42.599 --> 15:44.632
- I didn't go missing, David.

15:44.634 --> 15:46.967
The FBI knew where I was
the entire time.

15:46.969 --> 15:48.301
- All right listen, the
important thing is,

15:48.303 --> 15:50.236
we have David back,

15:50.238 --> 15:53.805
we have your bag back,
and here we are, all together.

15:53.807 --> 15:56.040
- What bag?

15:56.042 --> 15:58.242
- You stole my bag, David.

15:58.244 --> 16:00.544
- That bag?

16:00.546 --> 16:02.045
That bag looks like it hasn't
been used in a hundred years,

16:02.047 --> 16:04.447
so I put my toiletries in it.

16:04.449 --> 16:06.549
Why would you think that
I would steal that bag?

16:06.551 --> 16:09.051
- I don't know David, why did
you steal my eyeliner?

16:09.053 --> 16:11.887
- That was a phase in high
school!

16:11.889 --> 16:16.757
Now, did you come for me,
or did you come for that bag?

16:16.759 --> 16:18.125
- This was my grandmother's bag!
- We came for you!

16:18.127 --> 16:21.128
- I hitchhiked, in the middle
of the night,

16:21.130 --> 16:23.463
wearing all black!

16:23.465 --> 16:25.364
I was basically asking
to get hit by a car!

16:25.366 --> 16:27.366
- Why?

16:27.368 --> 16:29.601
- You told me that Diane Sawyer
gave you that bag,

16:29.603 --> 16:30.935
and that it was fake.

16:30.937 --> 16:32.970
- I didn't want you taking it.

16:32.972 --> 16:34.805
- Okay, because I have told
a lot of people

16:34.807 --> 16:37.607
that Diane Sawyer sells
fake bags on the down-low.

16:37.609 --> 16:42.511
- I slept in the cab of a truck!
Overnight!

16:42.513 --> 16:46.581
- Oh my God, who hasn't, David!

16:46.583 --> 16:47.748
(Sighs)

16:50.486 --> 16:51.785
(Car rumbles)

17:03.965 --> 17:05.631
(Luggage clatters)

17:11.638 --> 17:12.970
- Hmm.

17:17.176 --> 17:19.075
- Hi.
- What can I--

17:19.077 --> 17:20.342
- How are- yeah.
- What?

17:20.344 --> 17:24.311
- Um... I come bearing gifts.

17:24.313 --> 17:26.012
- Oh, how generous of you.

17:28.483 --> 17:30.883
- I think your car might need
a bit of a clean.

17:30.885 --> 17:33.184
- Is that a dead squirrel
on your hood?

17:35.688 --> 17:38.055
- They said that you have
been calling around,

17:38.057 --> 17:40.857
asking for me, which I thought
was very nice of you.

17:40.859 --> 17:43.559
- Oh, well, I didn't.

17:43.561 --> 17:45.761
- Hmm, well, they said
that you were.

17:45.763 --> 17:47.496
- Well, they were mistaken.

17:47.498 --> 17:49.297
- Oh, okay.

17:49.299 --> 17:52.900
- In fact, I was hoping
you wouldn't come back.

17:52.902 --> 17:55.802
- Wow, believe it or not,
that is one of the warmest

17:55.804 --> 17:58.604
welcomes I have received so far!

17:58.606 --> 17:59.871
- Usually when you tell someone

17:59.873 --> 18:02.273
that you have feelings for them,

18:02.275 --> 18:03.907
and the next thing they do
is drive out of town

18:03.909 --> 18:05.541
with no plan to return,

18:05.543 --> 18:08.076
you hope you never have
to see them again.

18:10.547 --> 18:13.648
- Well, in my defense, um...

18:13.650 --> 18:16.450
I was intending on staying
away for much longer,

18:16.452 --> 18:19.386
but I ran out of money,
and forgot my phone charger.

18:19.388 --> 18:24.157
- Oh, well, at least you were
well intentioned.

18:24.159 --> 18:26.692
- It's not like I didn't
think about what you said.

18:26.694 --> 18:28.860
Um, after we spoke,

18:28.862 --> 18:32.630
I thought, well,
there goes my one friend.

18:32.632 --> 18:35.332
Try saying that one out loud,
it is very dark.

18:40.805 --> 18:44.206
- Well...

18:44.208 --> 18:47.108
we will just have to work
through this, won't we?

18:47.110 --> 18:49.577
- Uh-huh. Yes.

18:49.579 --> 18:51.612
Yeah, um, if that's what you-

18:51.614 --> 18:53.180
if that's what you want,
then yes,

18:53.182 --> 18:54.781
I would like that very much.

18:54.783 --> 18:56.916
So um, I guess just tell me

18:56.918 --> 18:59.051
what you would like me to do,

18:59.053 --> 19:02.020
and I will do it.

19:02.022 --> 19:03.821
- Okay, well, let's start
by you leaving my office,

19:03.823 --> 19:07.224
and we'll see where
that takes us.

19:07.226 --> 19:08.892
- Mm-hmm. Well, I'll just--

19:08.894 --> 19:10.960
I'm gonna leave your office.

19:10.962 --> 19:12.661
I'm gonna leave your-
I'm gonna leave your office.

19:12.663 --> 19:13.995
So um...

19:16.833 --> 19:18.465
Best wishes to you.

19:18.467 --> 19:20.467
- Warmest regards.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.038
(Door slams)

19:31.078 --> 19:31.943
(Dog barks)

19:34.714 --> 19:36.213
DAVID: Okay, you're saying this
was circulated around town?

19:36.215 --> 19:37.614
This was before my nose job,

19:37.616 --> 19:39.616
how was anyone supposed
to recognize me?

19:39.618 --> 19:42.352
- Oh David, it's a rare gift
to strip vanity of its charm,

19:42.354 --> 19:43.686
yet here you are.
ROLAND: Yeah!

19:43.688 --> 19:45.354
- Oh, fuhhh...

19:45.356 --> 19:47.889
- Hello, Roses!

19:47.891 --> 19:50.324
- Oh, can this not wait 'til
after breakfast, please?

19:50.326 --> 19:52.059
- Well, this will only
take a second.

19:52.061 --> 19:54.528
- David!

19:54.530 --> 19:57.297
I'm so glad to see you back
home, all safe and sound.

19:57.299 --> 19:58.965
- Thanks.

19:58.967 --> 20:00.132
- Hmm. And I don't want
you to worry,

20:00.134 --> 20:04.402
I'm not gonna press charges,
okay?

20:04.404 --> 20:05.603
Next time, someone will think
twice

20:05.605 --> 20:07.538
before they steal my truck, yes?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.873
- Ooh, burn, David!

20:09.875 --> 20:11.407
- Shhh!

20:11.409 --> 20:13.308
- David, don't you um,

20:13.310 --> 20:15.143
have anything you wanna say
to Roland?

20:15.145 --> 20:19.213
- Uh...!

20:19.215 --> 20:22.583
Uh, I'm sorry for taking your
truck without permission.

20:27.789 --> 20:29.421
(Forks clink)

20:36.630 --> 20:38.730
Um...

20:38.732 --> 20:41.833
It was a bad mistake,

20:41.835 --> 20:43.700
and it won't happen again.

20:46.604 --> 20:48.003
(Forks clink)

20:52.142 --> 20:55.042
Oh my God, um...

20:55.044 --> 20:56.743
and I feel really bad about it.

20:56.745 --> 20:59.378
- But do you, David?

20:59.380 --> 21:00.112
- All right, all right,
all right,

21:00.114 --> 21:02.814
I accept your apology.

21:02.816 --> 21:05.016
- Thank you.

21:05.018 --> 21:06.951
- Yeah!
- Okay, now let's talk about gas.

21:06.953 --> 21:08.585
I'm thinking thirty cents
on the mile.

21:08.587 --> 21:10.753
- I think we're done here,
