JOE: In 1917, I signed up
to fight the Huns in France.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.994
Good men died all around me.

01:05.319 --> 01:07.789
And I saw no reason for it.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.430
The rules we lived by were lies.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.673
And they didn't apply
to those who made them.

01:20.280 --> 01:24.069
I swore if I made it home,
I would never follow orders again.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.313
I left a soldier.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.797
I came home an outlaw.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.710
I lived one robbery to the next.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.030
A good day was filled by sleep,

01:49.200 --> 01:52.591
and a good night spent
running too hard to look back.

01:56.200 --> 02:01.070
I lived that life for 10 years
until it caught up to me.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.073
It all started with an inside man.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.872
The Albert White crew
was playing a high stakes poker game,

02:22.040 --> 02:25.397
and our inside man
left the back door open for us.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.400
Three, two, one.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.994
Give us the fucking money.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.516
- Do you know whose fucking place this is?
- Give it!

02:37.680 --> 02:40.354
I asked, "Do you know whose fucking card
game this is", you fucking dunce?

02:40.520 --> 02:43.240
- You heard of Albert White?
- (GUN COCKS) Keep talking, bimbo.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.994
- (GRUNTS)
- Miss, come here. Come here!

02:46.520 --> 02:48.193
Do you want a drink
to go with your robbery?

02:48.360 --> 02:50.829
No. Just the money. Put it in the bag.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.834
Let's go. In the bag. Right here.
Nice and easy.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.760
What's your name?

02:57.920 --> 03:00.992
Emma Gould. What's yours?

03:01.280 --> 03:03.192
- You're gonna put a sock in my mouth?
- That's right.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.750
A sock? In my mouth?

03:05.960 --> 03:08.680
Never been used before,
and I wouldn't lie to you.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.274
That's what all the liars say.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.954
Quick, open up.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.631
Just do a quick...

03:18.120 --> 03:19.395
Here we go.

on the table.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.716
Great.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.355
All right, boys. Let's go.

Relax.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.796
We made out pretty good.
It was a nice hit.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.519
Yeah, it's all mine.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.909
JOE: Yeah. It's a living.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.357
- Yeah, you fucking Mick.
- Get the fuck out of here. Drive the car.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.437
ALBERT: Good afternoon. I'm Albert White.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.433
You must be Joe.

04:03.000 --> 04:03.990
Coughlin.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.470
Good to put a face to the name.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.752
This is Brennan Loomis, friend of mine.

04:08.920 --> 04:09.956
How are you?

04:12.800 --> 04:16.476
You're too smart
for the stuff you've been pulling.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.599
Nickel and diming with two dumb Guineas.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.231
They're your friends,
but they're stupid and they're wops.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.198
And they won't live to see 40.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.870
Take your time.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.510
But you can't work on your own.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.870
Not in this town.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.192
JOE: Albert was rounding up the troops.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.758
There was a war going on over rum.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.513
Dermot, go and have a word.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.473
JOE: Albert White ran the Irish mob...

04:48.680 --> 04:51.752
Brennan, keep an eye on him.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.830
Uh-huh.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.073
...and Maso Pescatore ran the Italians.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.798
It was tit for tat.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.592
White's gang set fire to rum trucks.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.513
Then a guy on Maso's payroll

05:20.680 --> 05:23.434
went home with a girl
no one had seen before.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.080

05:37.760 --> 05:41.436

with Albert White and his war.

But I didn't have a choice.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.799
His girlfriend was my inside man.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.551

06:11.400 --> 06:13.039
He'd kill her if she tried to leave him,

06:13.200 --> 06:17.513
and he'd kill us both 10 times over
if he found out we were together.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.912
But we were in love and we were stupid.

06:24.080 --> 06:27.391
And every time he was out of town,
we were together.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.390
No.

Emma, this is my father, Tom Coughlin.

Where are you from, Miss Gould?

07:23.400 --> 07:24.834
Dorchester.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.196
TOM: No, I meant before.
You're clearly Irish.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.874
All my mother's people are from Cork.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.032
Really? What's her maiden name?

- I don't know.
- You don't know?

07:34.840 --> 07:37.036
She died. She's dead, my mum, so...

07:41.680 --> 07:43.478
So, what is it you do?

07:45.800 --> 07:47.871
It's a real swank place, this, isn't it?

07:49.080 --> 07:51.720
I'm aware of how my son earns a living.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.315
I can only assume that
if you've come into contact with him,

07:54.480 --> 07:56.358
it was either during a crime,

07:56.520 --> 07:59.035
or in an establishment
populated by rough characters.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.510
(MOCK LAUGHS)

08:01.680 --> 08:03.831
Are my questions
making you feel uncomfortable?

08:05.040 --> 08:07.111
I don't know what you're on about.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.556
And to be honest, I don't really care.

08:09.720 --> 08:13.111
I'm on about you being the type of
lassie who consorts with criminals.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.234
The fact that the criminal is my son
isn't the issue.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.790
It is that my son is still my son.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.917
And I have feelings that cause me

08:22.080 --> 08:24.436
to question the wisdom
of consorting with the type of woman

08:24.600 --> 08:27.069
who knowingly consorts with criminals.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.552
- Did you follow all that?
- Enough, Dad. Enough. Okay?

08:30.720 --> 08:34.679
My uncle mentioned a copper
on his payroll, name of Coughlin.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.076
Is that you?

08:38.960 --> 08:41.794
This uncle would be your Uncle Robert?

08:42.200 --> 08:44.192
Who everyone knows as "Bobo"?

08:45.120 --> 08:49.273
No, the police officer you refer to
is Elmore Conklin.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.432
He's stationed in Savin Hill.

08:51.960 --> 08:55.351
He collects shakedowns from
illegal establishments such as Bobo's.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.717
I rarely get over to Dorchester.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.155
Still, as deputy superintendent,

08:59.320 --> 09:02.757
I'd be happy to take
a greater interest in Bobo.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.960
I need to powder.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.154
Was that necessary?

09:17.320 --> 09:19.198
I didn't start the fight, Joseph.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.477
So, don't criticize me
for how I finished it.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.716
I've been a police officer for 37 years.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.634
If I've learned one thing above all,
do you know what it is?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.757
This gonna be another yarn
from the old country?

09:30.960 --> 09:32.030
No.

09:32.200 --> 09:36.194
What you put out in the world
will always come back to you.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.511
But never how you predict.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.600
I'm sure it doesn't.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.914
Unearned confidence
of that about which one is ignorant,

09:44.080 --> 09:45.639
always has the brightest glow.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.832
I think I've earned enough.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.119
She's quite easy on the eyes.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.350
(SCOFFS)

09:53.600 --> 09:54.920
Yeah, she is.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.070
Apart from that,
I fail to grasp what you see in her.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.760
Because she's from Dorchester?

10:00.920 --> 10:04.197
That doesn't help. Her father's a pimp.
Her uncle killed two men.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.234
But I could overlook all that,
Joseph, if she wasn't...

10:07.400 --> 10:09.710
She just doesn't pretend
to be something she's not.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.150
Maybe she's just asleep.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.798
Thanks for stopping by.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.193
EMMA: Maybe you should
climb under his covers tonight.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.350
JOE: What?

10:19.520 --> 10:22.035
He looks at me like I'm trash.

10:22.320 --> 10:26.109
We're not people.
We're just the Goulds from Dorchester.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.511
We tat the lace for your fucking curtains.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.400
- Jesus! You know what...
- Don't fucking touch me.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.156
My whole life,
I got the high hat and the icy mitt

10:34.360 --> 10:35.555
from people like your father.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.271
We're not less than you.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.794
I never said you were.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.280
Well, he did.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.831
Fuck him, okay? I love you.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.957
You think love's so easy.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.514
It can be.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.596
(CRYING) Oh, God.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.079
- Come here.
- I don't want to.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.230
(MUFFLED) Leave me alone!

11:02.400 --> 11:05.871
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.999
- I want to go.
- Okay.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.510
Okay.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.759
Can you spare two bits?

11:20.400 --> 11:21.754
Thanks a lot.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.919
Joe Coughlin. I got an invitation.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.397
Put your arms up there. I gotta check you.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.190
Go ahead.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.480
Joseph?

11:44.680 --> 11:46.990
Joe Coughlin. Yeah.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.555
Pleasure.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.469
Do you know who I am?

11:52.680 --> 11:55.639
I know enough to show up here
when I'm asked.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.556
My name is Maso Pescatore.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.838
I run the North End

12:05.720 --> 12:08.235
and liquor coming up from Florida.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.634
I'm a man, uh,

12:11.800 --> 12:15.555
with the power
of other men's lives in my hands.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.359
But the truth is, uh,

12:18.880 --> 12:21.440
I'm just a simple wop
from the old country.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.789
Today, my only true rival is Albert White.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.639
When that is no longer the case,

12:30.800 --> 12:35.158
we can see an end to the fighting
that has plagued this town.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.518
Well, I got no beef with you.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.672
But I don't truck with gangsters.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.634
Not even a Sheik like you.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.231
You do soup jobs and stickups,

12:50.400 --> 12:52.357
but you're not a gangster.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.318
- What does that make you?
- I don't know.

12:54.480 --> 12:58.269
An outlaw, I guess.
I just don't want any part of that life.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.840
How many things, good or bad,

13:00.200 --> 13:04.160
come to us
whether we ask for them, or not?

13:04.400 --> 13:08.599
For example, one of my men
saw you with a young lady.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.753
Well, not so much a lady,
but a puttana moll

13:11.920 --> 13:13.718
whose daddy's Albert White.

13:18.200 --> 13:22.513
So, it no longer matters
so much what you want.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.958
You're in this life,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.276
and it can only end two ways.

13:29.440 --> 13:33.036
One, you get to Albert
and put an end to him.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.350
Two,

13:34.520 --> 13:37.399
I tell Albert about the girl.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.075
And he gets to you first.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.395
Like I said, I ain't a gangster.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.120
And I done enough killing in this life.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.355
You wanna tell your enemy
some rumor you heard? Go ahead.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.754
If I kill Albert White,

13:56.920 --> 13:59.958
somebody's just gonna jump up
and take his place.

14:00.120 --> 14:04.114
And I'd be married to the
Pescatore mob for the rest of my life.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.799
I stopped kissing rings a long time ago.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.593
Good afternoon.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.030
(DOOR CLOSES)

14:20.280 --> 14:22.033
EMMA: Do you think he told Albert?

14:22.240 --> 14:24.596
Nah. I'd be dead already.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.029
Christ.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.033
Hi! Hi!

34:02.800 --> 34:04.951
Joseph! Ah!

34:08.000 --> 34:09.036
How you doing?

34:09.199 --> 34:10.679
- Look at you.
- Look at you!

34:10.840 --> 34:12.797
Hey, sorry about your father.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.313
Yeah, sorry about your brother.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.277
Thank you. Hey, thank you.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.909
Listen, when Lefty Downer
found me in Montreal

34:19.080 --> 34:21.914
and told me the Pescatores
wanted me to come work for them,

34:22.120 --> 34:24.190
- I thought it was a straight bamboozle.
- (CHUCKLES)

34:24.360 --> 34:25.589
Then I thought,

34:25.760 --> 34:28.559
if anyone could charm the devil,
it's my old partner.

34:28.719 --> 34:30.598
- Look at this.
- Holy shit!

34:30.760 --> 34:32.513
Would you look at this?

34:32.679 --> 34:34.000
Here. After you.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.355
Get the fuck out of here.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.558
I work for you now. Boss Joe Coughlin.

34:38.760 --> 34:42.150
Reach under the seat,
and you'll find a friend.

34:48.120 --> 34:51.158
DION: Welcome to Ybor,
the Harlem of Tampa.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.197
Cigars built this place.

34:53.400 --> 34:57.917
What you're smelling now
is probably bolos or empanadas.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.594
The rest of Tampa leaves Ybor alone.

35:00.200 --> 35:03.113
As far as they're concerned,
we're a bunch of dirty spics and wops

35:03.280 --> 35:06.035
and we can fuck off and do what we need
to do as long as we leave them alone.

35:06.200 --> 35:10.399
You'd think we all get along,
but it don't work out that way.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.119
The Italians and the Cubans
keep to themselves.

35:14.360 --> 35:16.477
But the Cubans, they hate the Spaniards,

35:16.640 --> 35:19.109
and the Spaniards look at all Cubans
like they're uppity coons

35:19.280 --> 35:21.476
who forgot their place
since America freed them in '98.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.792
The Cubans and the Spanish,
they look down on the Puerto Ricans

35:25.960 --> 35:28.714
and everyone, I mean, everyone,
shits on the Dominicans.

35:28.880 --> 35:31.190
The Italians only respect you
if you came off the boat.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.396
How you doing, ladies?

35:32.560 --> 35:35.029
And the white people think
anyone gives a shit what they think.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.471
- You're a fucking piece of work.

JT: Who is it?

36:04.240 --> 36:05.594
Fireplace.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.640
Thanks, JT. Good work.

36:18.360 --> 36:22.877
There's a whole network
of tunnels like this under the city.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.355
- Who owns this warehouse?
- Frank Ormino did.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.113
What do you mean Ormino "did"?

36:28.280 --> 36:30.840
Ormino sprung a few leaks the other day.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.271
(GUNSHOTS)

36:33.680 --> 36:34.716
JOE: That was quick.

36:34.920 --> 36:38.072
Look at this over here.
Best money can buy!

36:38.240 --> 36:41.597
You gotta keep it at 186 Fahrenheit.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.554
Yeah, these babies never lie.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.878
Like to keep people from dying
when they drink your hooch.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.679
We made a lot of toilet booze in prison.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.957
Looks to me like
you're missing two key ingredients.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.430
- Which are?
- People and molasses.

36:54.600 --> 36:55.829
Yeah, we got a problem.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.753
- What?
- Our distributor.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.593
He's been coming up empty.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.036
- What is it?
- Boats have been sinking.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.436
- What's his name?
- Gary L. Smith.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.273
- Gary Ellsmith.
- No.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.638
Gary L. Smith. It's a middle initial.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.110
I don't know. He wants people to use it.
It's a Southern thing.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.839
Not just an asshole thing?

37:15.320 --> 37:16.436
- Both.
- (CHUCKLES)

37:19.480 --> 37:20.994
Thank you, Miss Roe.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.197
You must be Maso's new find.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.317
I guess something like that.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.833
- How you doing?
- All right.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.115
So, what brings you by?

37:31.320 --> 37:34.154
I've been asked to take over
Frank Ormino's affairs.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.312
I hope that's not permanent. (LAUGHS)

37:36.520 --> 37:39.160
- No offense.
- None taken. Why is that?

37:39.680 --> 37:43.799
Folks like dealing with who they know.
And nobody knows you.

37:43.960 --> 37:46.873
I see. Well, who would you suggest?

37:47.040 --> 37:49.509
I have no ambitions for it,

37:49.680 --> 37:53.356
but to keep continuity,
I might consider doing it for a term.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.240
We're mostly concerned with why
the last three supply runs were hit.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.629
That's the Cubans.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.200
Why don't you just go to a new supplier?

37:59.360 --> 38:01.158
- Not that simple.
- Why not?

38:03.640 --> 38:06.758
Because they're all
paying tribute to the Suarez family.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.877
That's the Cubans
who own that club down on 7th, right?

38:09.040 --> 38:10.474
We're gonna need to talk to them, too.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.637
(CHUCKLES) Uh...

38:14.200 --> 38:17.432
I'm afraid you don't understand
how things are done here.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.710
I deal with Mr. Suarez and his sister.

38:26.680 --> 38:30.037
Okay, I'm sure we can arrange a table
for tomorrow night about 9:00.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.230
JOE: Great.

38:31.400 --> 38:34.677
Now, Gary L., tell me this.
Do you work directly for Albert White?

38:34.840 --> 38:37.719
Or is there some intermediary
I should know about, as well?

38:37.880 --> 38:39.951
- What?
- We marked your bottles.

38:40.120 --> 38:43.079
- You what?
- If you distilled it, we marked it.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.039
And all these runs
that were supposedly lost at sea

38:46.200 --> 38:49.352
somehow made their way
into Albert White's speakeasies.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.920
Can you explain that?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.712
No. I don't understand.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.872
Dion drove me by your house
on the way over here.

38:56.040 --> 38:57.679
You got a lovely place.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.958
You're gonna have to pack up all that shit
and send it wherever it is you're going.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.914
(SCOFFS) Where am I going?

39:03.080 --> 39:04.480
Are you fucking her?

39:04.640 --> 39:06.074
What? Who?

39:06.280 --> 39:07.999
- Miss Roe.
- What?

39:08.160 --> 39:09.719
- He's fucking her.
- Without question.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.599
- Definitely fucking her.
- Oh, come on.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.797

Whatever. I don't care who you fuck.
Here's some tickets.

39:19.560 --> 39:21.916
This is the 11:00 Seaboard tonight.

39:22.080 --> 39:25.915
I don't care who you take with you,
but you gotta be on that train.

39:26.960 --> 39:27.996
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

39:28.200 --> 39:29.759
Wait a minute, gentlemen.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.872
- Come on a second here...
- We could go through the whole thing.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.316
I can bounce your head off the floor
like a fucking bowling ball.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.119
But let's just make it easy.

39:36.280 --> 39:38.511
Put yourself on that train, Gary L.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.152
Or we're gonna have to put you under it.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.754

39:43.320 --> 39:45.630
Now, come on, fellas. Gentlemen, can we...

40:01.600 --> 40:03.796
When did you mark the bottles?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.480
Fuck you talking about?

40:05.640 --> 40:07.552
You've been with me every second
since I've been here.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.154
See me mark any bottles?

40:09.320 --> 40:12.199
No! That's how come
I knew it was bullshit.

- Pleasure.

(SPEAKS SPANISH)

41:08.880 --> 41:10.553
Have a drink.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.078
Thank you very much.

41:13.280 --> 41:17.354
I never agreed with the Spanish
that the lighter rums were superior.

41:17.520 --> 41:18.795
Of course, we Cubans went along

41:18.960 --> 41:21.395
because of our obsession
that lighter is greater in all things.

- We've met.

41:27.520 --> 41:29.318
My mistake. Of course, we have met.

41:29.480 --> 41:30.800
Yes, we have.

41:30.960 --> 41:31.950
How you doing?

Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.472
God, this rum is incredible.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.751
Be nice if we could sell it up north.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.798

41:41.960 --> 41:44.555
No hurry. We'd be out of a job.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.553
Esteban took those.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.595
- The working people of Miami.
- Very good.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.796
It is a hobby.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.077
Perhaps I photograph you
someday, Mr. Coughlin.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.715
I don't know about that. Fewer pictures
out there of me, the better.

I'm here in Ybor
to distill and distribute the demon rum.

the tides have been calm all summer.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.757
so we worry
you may overtake our supply routes.

42:43.360 --> 42:44.476
No.

I use Señor Famosa's name to reassure you

42:47.480 --> 42:49.756
that from now on,
you can work directly with me

42:50.080 --> 42:51.912
and that you can charge me a higher price.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.675
- What do we get in return?
- You get access

42:54.880 --> 42:57.759
to Ormino's cops and judges,
which we now control.

42:57.920 --> 43:00.799
And most of whom wouldn't do business
with you otherwise because you're Cuban.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.277

to our molasses?

Nope. You just can't sell
to the White operation.

It is possible this will bring bloodshed.

by asking the nature of your business,

44:27.760 --> 44:31.071

never make the mistake of thinking
that I am corruptible.

Thought you were alone.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.870
That's all right, Loretta.
These gentlemen were just leaving.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.159
Honey, your manners.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.720
Yes, Father.

45:58.840 --> 46:00.832
Miss Loretta Figgis.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.992
Pleased to meet you, miss.
I'm Joe Coughlin.

46:03.160 --> 46:04.355
Dion Bartolo.

46:04.520 --> 46:07.991
Loretta is taking the train
on a long journey today.

46:08.640 --> 46:10.359
It's going around.

46:10.520 --> 46:12.512
- California.
- Is that right?

46:12.680 --> 46:15.070
She's gonna be a star in Hollywood.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.675
- It's only a screen test, Daddy.
- No.

46:18.160 --> 46:22.120
A screen agent came here
and picked out a few girls.

46:23.000 --> 46:23.990
My brother's out there.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.038
Your brother's in Hollywood?

46:26.200 --> 46:27.873
JOE: He's a stuntman, I'm told.

46:28.040 --> 46:29.759
Falling off horses.

46:30.280 --> 46:31.600
Pleased to meet you, miss.

46:32.480 --> 46:33.630
JOE: Chief.

46:34.320 --> 46:35.549
Gentlemen.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.271
- You're sure you don't want a banana?
- No, that's all right.

46:39.480 --> 46:43.190
- You can't get fruit like this in Boston.
- No, I know. It looks good.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.677
- Uh-oh. Here she is.
- What?

46:45.840 --> 46:48.275
- All right. Just watch this.
- Oh, yeah?

46:51.040 --> 46:53.600
Hello. Good afternoon.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.672
- How are you?
- I'm well. How are you?

46:55.840 --> 46:57.559
Excellent.

46:57.880 --> 47:01.715
You, uh... Have you and your brother
come to any decision on our...

47:03.240 --> 47:05.550
Not yet.
We're still considering, Mr. Coughlin.

47:05.760 --> 47:06.750
Okay.

47:06.920 --> 47:09.719
Yes. It would be quite an upheaval for us.

47:09.880 --> 47:11.394
I understand. Of course.

47:11.560 --> 47:14.029
We don't make changes easily.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.590
Oh. There's all kind of change, you know.

47:16.760 --> 47:20.674
Where I was recently staying,
we used to play chess a lot,

47:20.840 --> 47:23.594
and this is the kind of change
where you get your pawn

47:23.760 --> 47:26.559
to the end of the board
and it changes into a queen.

47:26.720 --> 47:28.598
There's not a lot to think about here.

47:28.760 --> 47:31.480
- Yes. I do play chess.
- You do?

47:31.640 --> 47:33.916
Yes. My father taught me.

47:34.120 --> 47:36.794
And what you might do well to remember
is that the pawn and the king

47:36.960 --> 47:38.997
end up in the same box
at the end of the game.

47:40.280 --> 47:43.637
The end? It's not about the end.

47:43.800 --> 47:46.156
It's about when you're playing the game.

47:46.320 --> 47:49.119
You could hang me upside down
and light me on fire at the end.

47:49.280 --> 47:51.272
I wanna win while I'm playing.

47:51.520 --> 47:53.079
(CHUCKLES)

47:55.320 --> 47:57.277
I have a feeling
you win most of the games you play.

47:58.600 --> 48:00.956
Not yet. But I plan on it.

48:02.280 --> 48:04.158
Why don't you join me?

48:42.840 --> 48:45.309
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

49:11.880 --> 49:15.476
You know, some people say
liquor is only your side business.

49:15.680 --> 49:16.875
Is that so?

49:17.720 --> 49:21.600
In fact, I heard rumors
you give most of your money away.

49:21.760 --> 49:23.240
A lot of it in Cuba.

49:24.560 --> 49:26.392
And you think that's foolish?

49:26.560 --> 49:30.315
Not foolish.
It's just not my cause, that's all.

49:30.560 --> 49:32.358
What is your cause?

49:32.520 --> 49:34.751
The distribution of demon rum.

49:36.040 --> 49:39.477
And that no man should rule
another man's life.

49:41.200 --> 49:44.113
If you corner the rum market,
you will be a king.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.432
I'll still have to deal with Albert White.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.557
But how will you hold the power
once you have it?

49:50.200 --> 49:52.590
Why? You don't think I'm strong enough?

49:53.080 --> 49:55.549
I don't know if you're cruel enough.

49:57.080 --> 49:58.958
And if you are,

50:00.040 --> 50:01.440
I will be very sad.

50:01.640 --> 50:04.030
Powerful men don't have to be cruel.

50:04.760 --> 50:06.194
But they usually are.

50:08.040 --> 50:11.317
Tell me something. Do you think
there is such a thing as a noble man?

50:11.480 --> 50:13.551
I got nothing against noble men.

50:13.720 --> 50:15.632
They just rarely live past 40.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.792
My father died for Cuba.

50:20.600 --> 50:22.796
My mother died of a broken heart.

50:24.280 --> 50:27.557
He would often tell Esteban and I,
"You cannot truly live

50:27.720 --> 50:31.270
"unless there is something
for which you would die."

50:31.960 --> 50:34.759
He sounds like a good man.

50:35.320 --> 50:36.640
He was.

50:38.440 --> 50:41.080
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

51:32.680 --> 51:33.716
We will never be lovers.

51:34.400 --> 51:35.390
No?

51:38.360 --> 51:39.953
Why is that?

51:42.680 --> 51:44.353
We will not be lovers.

(INAUDIBLE)

52:50.160 --> 52:52.914
JOE: We cornered the rum market
and lived like kings.

52:55.920 --> 52:57.240
You know what? Fine. Come on, hurry up.

53:00.280 --> 53:03.034
Banks collapsed. Jobs dried up.

53:03.240 --> 53:05.436
But vice, it seemed,

53:06.440 --> 53:08.272
was Depression-proof.

53:09.120 --> 53:10.270
Okay, let's go.

53:14.920 --> 53:18.152
JOE: The Suarez-Coughlin
partnership created a rare stability.

53:19.200 --> 53:21.396
(ALL CHEERING)

53:37.480 --> 53:39.756
We paid off Albert's guys
in Central Florida

53:39.920 --> 53:41.798
to put down their guns.

53:43.080 --> 53:47.040
So, when Albert wanted to hit us,
he had to use his Miami crews.

53:51.960 --> 53:54.156
And when they showed up,
we bushwhacked them.

53:56.240 --> 53:57.469

54:13.520 --> 54:16.035
Albert was living on the run in Miami,

54:16.200 --> 54:20.558
and there wasn't a speak in Central
or North Florida we didn't sell to.

54:53.880 --> 54:55.837
Get something from in there
and put this shit out.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.070
All right.

- Get down, now!
- (PEOPLE SCREAM)

55:02.520 --> 55:04.989
Get on the floor. Get down!

55:05.160 --> 55:07.231
Get down! Get down!

55:10.400 --> 55:11.880
This is what happens

55:12.040 --> 55:14.509
when Catholics
try to sell liquor down here.

55:14.680 --> 55:17.036
The guy's name is RD Pruitt.

55:17.200 --> 55:19.590
Well, we'd better go find him.

55:19.760 --> 55:20.910
He's in the Klan.

55:21.080 --> 55:23.390
So, what? So are five million
other guys in this country.

55:23.560 --> 55:25.233
The Klan has a lot of fucking juice.

55:25.400 --> 55:27.471
They're inbreds
with fourth grade educations.

55:27.640 --> 55:29.074
Oh, they're gonna love you.

with coloreds and lives with a Cuban.

I haven't been to church in half my life?

56:08.280 --> 56:10.192
All right, now.

56:10.360 --> 56:11.589
RD,

56:12.440 --> 56:15.274
word is you're causing trouble
down in Ybor.

56:16.640 --> 56:17.960
How's that?

56:19.600 --> 56:22.479
Well, we hear you're sticking up places.

56:23.960 --> 56:26.350
I don't know a damn thing about that.

RD,

56:37.480 --> 56:40.712
this is a businessman
who's come here to do business.

56:40.880 --> 56:43.918
And I suggest that you do it with him.

56:44.320 --> 56:49.315
This man is a bootlegger
and a fornicator with niggers.

56:51.640 --> 56:55.953
He needs to be tarred and feathered,
not done business with.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.673
(CHUCKLES)

57:12.160 --> 57:14.516
So, you like the Parisian, right?

57:14.680 --> 57:15.830
And if I did?

57:16.000 --> 57:18.993
I might be able to cut you in
on 10% of the house take.

57:19.200 --> 57:21.192
- You'd do that?
- I would.

57:21.440 --> 57:22.556
Well,

57:24.040 --> 57:26.032
I ought to be worth more than 10%.

57:26.200 --> 57:27.475
What were you thinking?

57:27.640 --> 57:29.120
I was thinking 60.

57:29.280 --> 57:30.634
JOE: 60%?

57:30.840 --> 57:32.274
The biggest club in town?

57:32.840 --> 57:33.830
That's right.

For what, exactly?

57:36.360 --> 57:38.716
My friends might look on you more kindly.

- What friends?
- 60%.

Save your father some embarrassment.

57:49.200 --> 57:51.157
- What's that?
- 15%.

57:52.680 --> 57:54.239
I will beat you to death.

57:54.400 --> 57:55.390
Excuse me?

57:56.960 --> 57:58.280
You know,

58:00.080 --> 58:03.357
that does sound like a fair arrangement.
You go to 20?

58:03.520 --> 58:07.673
I think 15's pretty good for a job
you don't have to show up to work for.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.198
Well, it's a fair deal

58:13.360 --> 58:15.556

I don't like getting some kid
sent down here like we need supervision.

58:53.720 --> 58:55.439
No! We don't need supervision.

Digger wants to look at the casino option,
check progress, that's all.

58:58.800 --> 58:59.995
He's gonna report back to the old man.

It's a joke. Don't make a big thing of it.

59:02.640 --> 59:05.712
Maso's still gonna listen to what his son
tells him about starting a new casino.

59:05.880 --> 59:06.916
DION: Don't worry about it.

59:07.080 --> 59:08.309
How did he get the name "Digger"?

59:08.520 --> 59:09.636
Because he's a fucking dummy.

59:09.800 --> 59:12.998
All they let him do is dig ditches
for the bodies they bump off.

59:13.160 --> 59:14.560
- No shit?
- Yeah.

59:14.720 --> 59:15.710
(BOTH LAUGH)

59:17.760 --> 59:19.080
JOE: That's great.

59:19.280 --> 59:22.114
JOE: I'd come up with a plan
to invest in a casino

59:22.280 --> 59:26.240
with stakeholders in Sarasota
at the new Ritz development site.

59:27.160 --> 59:28.640
Ritz Hotel and Casino.

59:28.800 --> 59:30.280
Top shelf. A-one.

59:30.440 --> 59:31.590
...right to the casino.

59:31.760 --> 59:33.274
Absolute top-level resort.

59:33.440 --> 59:36.478
Extraordinary resort experience
whether you gamble, or not.

59:41.680 --> 59:43.239
JOE: For such a violent business,

59:43.400 --> 59:45.631
it was populated with
a surprising number of guys

59:45.800 --> 59:48.156
who were just putting food on the table.

59:48.320 --> 59:50.755
Digger wasn't one of those guys.

59:53.680 --> 59:55.000
So, this is it.

Volstead Act won't last forever, right?

59:57.480 --> 59:59.949

when Prohibition ends?

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.110
Gambling.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.596
We use the connections
we put together to get it legalized.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.672
And we're the only ones in place
to run it.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.160
And this is it?

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.039
JOE: It will be. Ritz Longboat Key.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.157
I sat down with the owners
in Sarasota last week.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.640
Why did they let us in?

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.031
Because they can't get gambling legal,
and they can't run a casino.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.796
They own the property, we run the casino.
We chop the profits 50-50.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.519
Wait a minute.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.474
Do we have a magic stick
for changing laws?

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.955
I heard you got bingo legal.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.636
(LAUGHS)

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.718
It's a step. It's that prerequisite.
You gotta do one thing,

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.712
- and then you get...
- Yeah, I know. It was a prerequisite.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.678
Your grandmother can come down.
She'll play in the church.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.995
Bingo!

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.793
Look, I got bagmen buying inspectors
in Tallahassee and Sarasota.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.032
I got guys going after senators
and IRS agents who gamble.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.154
We get gambling legal, we are rich. Legit.

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.154
We'll run Florida, we'll take over Cuba.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.829
But my take's gotta stay
somewhere near where it is.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.357
And there's no power in being crew boss
and shaking down longshoremen.

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:49.479
You ever think maybe
that's the point, smart guy?

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:51.871
You need me. I built this.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.355
MASO: We could use you.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.557
But I'm sensing a lack of gratitude.

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.710

or the niggers you hang out with.

If I tell you to clean the shit
out of my toilet, guess what you do?

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.552
I can kill your cunt girlfriend

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:15.872
and burn your house to embers
if I feel like it.

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:21.395
So, do you want to be crew boss,

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.191
or clean the shit out of my toilet?

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:27.034
I'm accepting applications for both.

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.556
I guess it's crew boss.

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:38.669
That's my boy.

We have a few nice spots set aside.

what I like about Albert White?

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.354
What?

01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:54.399
It's that he knows Tampa, too.

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:57.480
Which means nobody needs you, dumb fuck.

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:25.631

he looked to me to help his son.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.834

you'd regret your whole life.

02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:37.796
My son loved the show.

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:42.952
It was about an honest sheriff
in a dirty town.

02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:53.916
All he could talk about
was getting his own badge when he grew up.

02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:02.800
That's my brother.

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:04.189
(LAUGHS)

02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:09.037
That was my brother's name.
That's your uncle.

02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:16.710
In the afternoons,
we fished for red fin and snook.

02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:27.874
One day, my son asked me,
"Where's heaven in the sky?"

02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:33.193
And I told him what Loretta told me.

02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:40.633
"This is heaven. Right here.

02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:45.079
"We're in it now."

02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.640
(MUSIC PLAYING)

02:02:01.305 --> 02:02:07.285
