     my first rock concert.

    the band back together,

     habanero, grapefruit.

      Now I'm really sad.

  I actually need some advice.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.798
     - Is this where I say,
           "from me?"

02:46.800 --> 02:48.500
          And you say,
       "no, from marcus"?

        - No, I'm--I'm--

02:50.838 --> 02:53.605
   I'm as shocked as you are.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.507
         The thing is,

     with her to new york,

02:58.312 --> 03:00.345

      - Well, nothing yet.
I mean, I don't know what to do.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.591
- I mean, part of me just wants
   to drop everything and go.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.226
      I mean, new york is
   an incredible city, right?

03:14.228 --> 03:15.427
    - It's a wonderful city.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.930
        - It's romantic,
   and, like, I'd be in love

03:26.273 --> 03:28.207
     It seems like she is,

03:28.209 --> 03:30.909
And I definitely have never felt
     this way about anyone.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.414

          of course--

I mean, I feel like we just met.

03:41.255 --> 03:45.324
       But I guess, like,
 the only way to know for sure

03:45.326 --> 03:46.825
  Is just to go for it, right?

   is a slight overstatement,

         - That's real.

        about it, uh...

08:16.763 --> 08:17.829
            - What?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.699
  - You just broke into song.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.601
        - No, I didn't.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.970
        - What are you--
      are you feeling hot?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.938
  Are you feeling lightheaded?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.874

08:30.544 --> 08:31.676
             - No.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.879
              No.
       No, I'm not upset.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.813
           I'm just--

08:35.816 --> 08:37.749
That would be really irrational,
          wouldn't it?

08:37.751 --> 08:40.952
  I mean, you're our neighbor.
     You are our neighbor.

08:44.657 --> 08:47.692
  Neighbors move, don't they?

08:47.694 --> 08:50.195
       Yeah, that's just
     how life works, will.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.866
        - I'm so sorry.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.203
  - You got to live your life,
           don't you?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.171
I've got to tell marcus, though.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.675
    - No, no, I'll tell him.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.043
     I'm gonna do it today.

09:09.015 --> 09:09.247
               .

09:09.249 --> 09:14.553
I want to--I got some big stuff
  I need to talk to you about.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.221
 - Oh, I've got some big stuff

09:16.223 --> 09:18.957
     I need to talk to you
        about too, will.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.692
          Electricity.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.594
    What do you say we trick
       the tree house out

09:22.596 --> 09:24.162
      With some lighting?
             - Oh.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.330
      - You know what else
         would be cool?

09:25.332 --> 09:26.798
         A mini fridge.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.567
         We could keep
       our sodas up here.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.336
 And we're gonna be eating ribs
         up here a lot,

09:31.338 --> 09:34.005
 So we're gonna need some sort
      of rib escape hatch,

09:34.007 --> 09:35.040
 Just in case my mom shows up.

09:39.111 --> 09:41.212
           - I, uh...

09:45.585 --> 09:48.053
            I, um...

09:48.055 --> 09:52.023
      I think--I feel like
  electricity in a tree house

09:52.025 --> 09:56.895
   So what do you say we just
  finish up the final touches,

09:56.897 --> 09:59.064
    And we'll call it a day,
           all right?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.766
      - Okay, but consider
     the rib escape hatch,

10:01.768 --> 10:03.068
    'cause we're gonna need
          that thing.

10:09.642 --> 10:10.809
 - This doesn't make any sense.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.310
        It doesn't make
       any sense at all.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.012
     - You should be proud
          of me, man.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.115
    I'm choosing commitment
 for the first time in my life.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.684
  - What about your commitment
             to me?

10:19.686 --> 10:22.721
    - Dude, we're gonna see
    each other all the time.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.323
   That's why I'm buying you
     a cool winter outfit,

10:25.325 --> 10:27.859
       'cause you just do
   a little hop on the plane.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.828
  - People say crap like that
  to each other all the time,

10:29.830 --> 10:32.030
      And then they never
     see each other again.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.265
         - Whoa! Whoa!
           Whoa! Ah!

10:34.267 --> 10:37.736
  - This is what it's gonna be
     like in new york, huh?

10:37.738 --> 10:40.305
   It's a big city, but it's
   a big city of tiny rooms.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.640
     And you're a big guy.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.041
  You're gonna hate it there.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.209
     And when winter hits,

10:44.211 --> 10:46.277
       This coat of yours
    isn't gonna do anything.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.712

10:47.714 --> 10:50.048
A guys eyeballs froze one time!

10:50.050 --> 10:51.216
    - You just shut up, man!

10:51.218 --> 10:53.118
 Do you think I want to leave?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.353
     You are my best friend
      in the world, dude.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.256
       Okay, do you think
    I want to leave marcus?

10:58.258 --> 11:01.092
  This is the hardest decision
     I've ever had to make,

11:01.094 --> 11:04.295
  But my whole life, any time
  things have gotten remotely,

11:04.297 --> 11:06.398
       You know, serious
   with a girl, I've walked.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.066
         I'm 34, dude.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.067

11:09.069 --> 11:10.068
        You got laurie.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.236
 You got three wonderful kids.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.271
         I got to make
      my own path, right?

11:13.273 --> 11:16.274
        I just need you
      to be a true friend,

11:16.276 --> 11:18.043
    And I need you to just--

11:18.045 --> 11:19.110
        Just support me.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.346
       I know it's hard.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.282
            - Okay.
             Okay.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.717
   - So I have your blessing?

11:25.719 --> 11:28.853
 - You don't need my blessing.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.789
         But you got me
        no matter what.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.457
       - Thank you, man.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.759
        It really means
       everything to me.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.102
    You never seen two guys
         hug each other

11:44.104 --> 11:46.137
   In a dressing room before?

11:46.139 --> 11:47.272
      What's your problem?

11:51.310 --> 11:52.711
          - Uh, hello?

           - Oh, hi.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.147
   Do you know when the owner
         will be back?

11:56.149 --> 11:58.183
   I'm here about the sublet.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.451
         - I don't know
   what you're talking about.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.352
  - This place is up for rent.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.321
         I got the sign
     from the bagel store.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.889

            - What?

12:17.304 --> 12:19.370
       - Get out of here!
       He isn't leaving!

       - What's going on?

12:23.110 --> 12:24.275

        Is will leaving?

  he was supposed to tell you.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.423
 Yeah, he's moving to new york.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.825
         He's gonna go
        and be with sam.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.227
         Marcus, wait!

12:42.229 --> 12:44.462
             Stop.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.833
   - I don't want it anymore.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.336
     I don't want to see it
          ever again!

13:02.182 --> 13:04.349
       - You're leaving?
    You're leaving me, will?

13:04.351 --> 13:07.218
    - I don't--I don't want
to leave, marcus, but I have to.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.787
         Marcus, stop!

13:13.325 --> 13:15.426
         Marcus, wait.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.028
      Listen to me, okay?

13:17.030 --> 13:20.031
        It is killing me
       to leave you, man.

13:20.033 --> 13:23.334
     But I love sam, okay?

13:23.336 --> 13:25.270
And so I got to go be with her.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.372
   And I'm so sorry for that.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.942
  I need you to understand me,
           all right?

13:30.944 --> 13:33.511
        - I understand.

13:33.513 --> 13:38.349
       You're leaving me
     just like my dad did.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.252
I'm getting really used to this.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.024

        I am...So sorry.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.162
         - Why are you
       apologizing to me?

13:51.164 --> 13:54.199
   I'm not the one you hurt.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.267
 I'm gonna go check on my son.

   You think there's any way

14:26.166 --> 14:27.999
           He'll come
    to the concert tonight?

14:28.001 --> 14:30.201
   - I don't think so, will.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.204
          Now, listen,
       I know you see me

          - I do not.

14:39.479 --> 14:43.047
 - But when it comes to marcus,
       I am a mama bear,

14:43.049 --> 14:45.316
        And I will kill
        to protect him.

 I wasn't completely honest...

       don't worry, mom.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.742
       The people deserve
       to hear you sing.

16:50.744 --> 16:54.712
            - ¶ oh ¶

16:54.714 --> 16:57.248

   Thank you very, very much.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.566
  Uh, we're gonna slow it down
         a little now.

17:15.568 --> 17:19.203
          This song is
     for a special friend.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.138
 Uh, we sang it once together.

17:21.141 --> 17:24.041
         He's not here,
       but I wish he was.

17:34.687 --> 17:38.189
    ¶ when you walk through
           the door ¶

17:44.164 --> 17:48.566
        ¶ being the way
    that you are is enough ¶

17:48.568 --> 17:52.370
      ¶ and everyone else
         in the room ¶

 ¶ baby, you light up my world
       like nobody else ¶

18:03.550 --> 18:06.451
       ¶ the way that you
        flip your hair ¶

18:06.453 --> 18:09.320
    ¶ gets me overwhelmed ¶

18:09.322 --> 18:10.822
           - Marcus?
      [door opens, closes]

18:10.824 --> 18:13.591

     ¶ to prove I'm right ¶

18:56.402 --> 18:59.837
     ¶ I put it in a song ¶

18:59.839 --> 19:02.807
      ¶ I don't know why ¶

            - Wait.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.481
       That's great, man,

20:17.483 --> 20:18.950
          But, katie--
    which one is she again?

20:18.952 --> 20:21.252
    - She was my first kiss.
      - Mm, that's right.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.920
   - The whole romance thing
          is over now,

20:22.922 --> 20:26.390
       But she's actually
my first bona fide friend, will.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.526
 - Your first bona fide friend.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.328
 That is cause for celebration.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.368
          - Darling...

20:37.370 --> 20:40.905
   I made you a lovely sprout
  and cashew cheese sandwich,

20:40.907 --> 20:45.543
 All sorts of fermented yummies
      inside if you want.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.546
            Marcus?

20:48.548 --> 20:51.882

    Go and take that picture
         off the wall.

21:00.859 --> 21:02.793
            - What?
         - Just do it.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.697
  - Do you want me to come up?

21:06.699 --> 21:08.266
            Marcus?
         - A rib chute.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.401
       Oh, my gosh, will,
        you're a genius.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.936
          I got to go.
      Same time next week?

21:11.938 --> 21:14.605
       - Without a doubt.
            Go! Go!
