Good bye, friend.

00:06.208 --> 00:08.491
If you do not help with this marriage,

It's a part of my character...It's a...

00:12.260 --> 00:14.063
Sounding the boring alarm!

00:15.542 --> 00:18.210
I can't buy luxuries and expensive
fur coats...

00:18.330 --> 00:19.411
What do you want?

00:19.625 --> 00:21.229
I'm done!

Don't hog the sneeze, bro.

01:51.189 --> 01:55.418

- Get in there, motherfucker. Come on.

01:55.451 --> 01:57.261
Oh...

01:57.294 --> 01:59.561
Ugh. Disgusting, dude.
You got your chin in it.

01:59.602 --> 02:01.203
- What? Ah, I'm sorry, man.
- Gross.

02:01.236 --> 02:02.738
I'm still trying to
figure out these dimensions.

02:02.803 --> 02:04.537
That is a pretty bold chin.

02:04.570 --> 02:07.567
Better be bold. Cost me 50
g's for this motherfucker.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.238
Speaking of g's,
I was wondering,

02:10.270 --> 02:11.310
is there gonna be
a Christmas bonus this year?

02:11.343 --> 02:13.809
- Christmas bonus?
- Yeah. I'm just saying,

02:13.850 --> 02:15.419
between this chin
and Maria's titties,

02:15.452 --> 02:18.820
I can't afford Christmas gifts
for my kids, unfortunately.

02:18.853 --> 02:21.123
- You don't have any money to buy
your kids gifts? - Yeah, I miscalculated.

02:21.156 --> 02:23.355
Man, you better chill with
that Bob Cratchit bullshit.

02:23.387 --> 02:25.228
Don't be acting like you don't
get paid handsomely, all right?

02:25.261 --> 02:26.525
That shit's gonna piss me off.

02:26.598 --> 02:29.064
Don't trip.
I'm just asking. Geez.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.004
Do I got any coke boogers
up my nose?

02:31.045 --> 02:32.612
No. Do I got
any coke on my chin?

02:32.677 --> 02:34.379
Yeah, dude. Your goddamn
whole thing's covered in it.

02:34.412 --> 02:36.411
Looks like the fucking tip
of Mount Everest.

02:36.444 --> 02:39.653
May I have everyone's attention please?
Gather 'round.

02:39.686 --> 02:42.290
Get your dicks outta your hands.
Come on. Gather 'round.

02:42.323 --> 02:45.029
Your new leader
has an announcement.

02:45.062 --> 02:50.605
Da-da-da!
Make a path. Make a path.

02:50.670 --> 02:56.311
Make a path.

Good day, everyone.

02:59.512 --> 03:03.751
We all knew that Guy Young's racist
diatribe was gonna hurt us all.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.455
But as your new leader,
I promise you

03:06.488 --> 03:09.392
that I will turn this
fucking sinking ship around

03:09.426 --> 03:12.159
with the help
of the <i>Sesh Christmas Special.</i>

03:12.192 --> 03:15.599

you guys to cut together

I need it to be hilarious, OK?

03:17.738 --> 03:20.400

to find me an array

03:20.433 --> 03:22.039
of young beautiful
women to be my reindeer.

03:22.104 --> 03:24.842
Wardrobes, I'd like you
to create some reindeer suits

03:24.875 --> 03:27.813
- with the titties cut out.
- Hold on. What's all this shit?

03:27.846 --> 03:29.783
Why we fucking with the formula?
Guy Young did it right.

03:29.856 --> 03:33.254
He had us doing a silly little version
of "Twelve Days of Christmas".

03:33.287 --> 03:35.653
- And that shit was dope.
- It was dope? Really? Guy Young?

03:35.726 --> 03:37.421
He's a racist, Jimmy.

03:37.462 --> 03:40.000
Being racist,
it's far from dope, dudes.

03:40.033 --> 03:44.938
I defeated Guy Young.
So that makes me the H-N-I-C.

03:44.971 --> 03:47.305
If anybody has
any problems with that,

03:47.338 --> 03:51.306
well, you can direct your
inquiries to Billy and/or Trent.

03:51.347 --> 03:55.415
Y'all wanna fuck with two dudes wearing
Wilsons Leather black fucking coats?

03:55.456 --> 03:58.854
None of you wanna fuck
with this Wilsons Leather shit.

03:58.887 --> 04:01.223
Great. Beautiful.

04:01.256 --> 04:03.330
I can't wait to see
what we do together, all right?

04:03.363 --> 04:06.867
This Christmas show's
gonna be spectacular.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.771
Thank you for your time.
Get back to work, please.

04:08.836 --> 04:10.372
Everyone, back to work!
Back to work!

04:10.405 --> 04:12.205
There's nothing more
to see here!

04:12.278 --> 04:17.616
You're on the clock.

04:17.649 --> 04:33.040
[door opens]

04:37.544 --> 04:40.547
Let's make this quick.
My client's a busy man.

04:40.588 --> 04:43.288
OK. On behalf of Mrs. Powers,

04:43.329 --> 04:45.561
I have outlined
a temporary arrangement

04:45.626 --> 04:50.466
which gives April Powers access to half
of the assets of the family accounts.

04:50.499 --> 04:53.968
- [giggles] - On behalf of Mr. Powers,
we decline the arrangement.

04:54.001 --> 04:55.168
Excuse me?

04:55.201 --> 04:58.642
Jared, break 'em off something.
Tell 'em what's good.

04:58.675 --> 05:03.148
Mrs. Powers is denied access to all
assets till a settlement has been reached

05:03.181 --> 05:05.114
or the filing
has been withdrawn.

05:05.147 --> 05:08.620
- Kenny, you took all the money
out of the joint account? - Nah, April.

05:08.653 --> 05:10.726
Jared did.
Motherfucker's cray.

05:10.759 --> 05:14.294
- [April] Can he do that?
- Mr. Powers is also sole title holder

05:14.327 --> 05:16.364
- on the family vehicles.
- [Kenny] Nice work, Benjamin.

05:16.397 --> 05:19.101
You better get used to walking,
<i>muchacha.</i>

05:19.134 --> 05:25.072
Kenny, can I talk
to you outside?

05:25.105 --> 05:29.006
Very well.

05:29.047 --> 05:30.677
[exhales]
What's wrong, April?

05:30.710 --> 05:32.446
Your little storybook divorce
getting all fucked up?

05:32.479 --> 05:35.152
- This isn't fair, Kenny.
- Hmph. Oh, I know it's not fair.

05:35.185 --> 05:37.953
My legal dream team is
long-dicking you up the butt.

05:37.986 --> 05:40.022
I'll spend every penny I have
to win this divorce.

05:40.055 --> 05:42.389
- Do you hear me?
- Can't we just be adults about this?

05:42.422 --> 05:44.788
- Think about the kids, Kenny.
- Oh, I'm thinking about the kids.

05:44.821 --> 05:46.556
I'm thinking about how I'm
gonna turn 'em against you.

05:46.589 --> 05:49.967
Wait till Christmas. Then we'll see
who gets them the better presents.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.504
I wanted to talk to you
about that.

05:51.537 --> 05:54.839
I was thinking that you could
celebrate with them on the 23rd.

05:54.873 --> 05:56.869
- The fucking 23rd?
- [April] Yeah.

05:56.902 --> 05:58.636
You selfish little trollop.

05:58.669 --> 06:01.403
How dare you keep those children
from me on Christmas morn.

06:01.436 --> 06:03.475
Those children
are gonna be devastated.

06:03.540 --> 06:06.014
They are so upset
about so many things, Kenny.

06:06.047 --> 06:08.520
They're upset about Dakota.
They keep talking about him.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.489
I don't understand how he got
outta the garage, by the way.

06:10.522 --> 06:11.919
Well, don't you be looking
at me all accusatory.

06:11.952 --> 06:14.357
All right? I don't know how the fuck
he got outta the garage either.

06:14.390 --> 06:16.051
- [sighs] - Maybe he fucking used
an ancient Navajo

06:16.092 --> 06:17.957
- fucking wolf warp.
- Kenny, please.

06:17.990 --> 06:21.863
This is a nightmare right now.
There has to be a more simple way.

06:21.896 --> 06:23.767
- There has to be.
- Well, I know a simple way.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.365
- OK, what?
- Call it off, April.

06:26.398 --> 06:29.372
Fucking let me come back to the
house and all this will go away.

06:29.406 --> 06:30.973
You and I can just
call this shit a draw.

06:31.006 --> 06:33.677
I can't.

06:33.710 --> 06:36.677
I want out.

06:36.710 --> 06:37.877
Very well then.

06:37.910 --> 06:41.780
I want you to remember
that this is what you wanted.

06:41.812 --> 06:46.546
Remember it...
[whispers] when I beat you.

06:46.619 --> 06:49.123
Merry Chri-ma.

06:49.156 --> 06:51.723
[holiday music]

06:51.756 --> 06:53.492
Going through a divorce
is the shit, dude.

06:53.525 --> 06:55.199
- Hey.
- Aw, yeah.

06:55.232 --> 06:56.231
Hey, lady.

06:56.264 --> 06:58.135
[Kenny] I'm seeing
a lot of looks out here.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.471
- [Stevie] Ooh, look at her.
- [Kenny] Kristi Yamaguchi?

07:00.504 --> 07:02.703
Nah.
Kristi Yama-gonna-fuck-you.

07:02.736 --> 07:04.407
- Ooh, yeah.
- [laughing]

07:04.440 --> 07:07.341
I gotta tell you, man, if I can win
Christmas, April's gonna be fucked.

07:07.374 --> 07:10.174
- So what's the move, dog?
- Oh, I'll tell you the move.

07:10.215 --> 07:12.648
I found out all the presents April's
getting the kids for Christmas,

07:12.682 --> 07:15.722
- I'm gonna get the same exact
ones. Fuck her shit all up. - [laughing]

07:15.755 --> 07:19.122
Hope you saved them receipts, April. 'Cause
you taking that shit back to the store.

07:19.155 --> 07:22.093
[laughs] That bitch is gonna
feel dumb as hell, dog.

07:22.133 --> 07:24.026
Goddamn, dude. Stop calling her a bitch, all right?
Technically we're still married.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.992
I mean, I don't call
your wife a bitch.

07:26.033 --> 07:28.166
OK. I have called her
a bitch before, but...

07:28.199 --> 07:30.028
Yeah, April's different.
She's a white person.

07:30.061 --> 07:32.899
- [chuckles]
- Must be nice, you know,

07:32.932 --> 07:35.404
being able to buy your kids
everything they want for Christmas.

07:35.437 --> 07:39.972
Or... or just
anything at all, really.

07:40.005 --> 07:42.741
- It is.
- You know, I was thinking,

07:42.774 --> 07:45.279
since we won't be opening
gifts Christmas morning,

07:45.312 --> 07:48.984
I'll have some extra time and maybe you
could let me read your screenplay.

07:49.017 --> 07:52.223
Look, Stevie, I appreciate the fact that
you are interested in my life's story,

07:52.256 --> 07:53.453
but you're not reading it,
all right?

07:53.486 --> 07:55.282
You think Tom Cruise or
Vin Diesel goes around

07:55.323 --> 07:58.257
letting just any Tom, Dick or Jay Leno
read their fucking screenplays? No.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.793
They don't.
Chin up, Stevie.

08:00.825 --> 08:02.392
I'm sure you'll
figure out something.

08:02.425 --> 08:04.224
[laughs]
Get it? Chin up.

08:04.257 --> 08:07.592
'Cause you got a new chin.
[laughs]

08:07.633 --> 08:11.933
[doorman] Good morning, sir.

08:11.966 --> 08:13.596
[whispers, indistinct]

08:13.629 --> 08:16.204
What the hell are you two doing
loitering in this fancy hotel?

08:16.238 --> 08:20.037
Uh, well, actually we came because
we're really worried about you, Kenny.

08:20.070 --> 08:22.572
We know that you're going
through a rough patch

08:22.605 --> 08:25.243
and just don't want
you to harm yourself.

08:25.276 --> 08:26.538
What the hell do you
think I'm gonna do?

08:26.579 --> 08:28.545
Put a gun in my mouth?
Give me a fucking break.

08:28.578 --> 08:30.516
I ain't going through
a rough patch, Cassie.

08:30.549 --> 08:32.119
What we got going on here?

08:32.152 --> 08:35.759
One, two, three, four, five,
six, infinity and beyond.

08:35.792 --> 08:38.092
That's right.
Still fucking rich as hell.

08:38.125 --> 08:39.458
Still on TV.

08:39.491 --> 08:41.227
Still living in the fucking
presidential suite

08:41.260 --> 08:42.523
in the middle
of downtown Charlotte.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.860
I'd say shit's
going pretty good.

08:43.893 --> 08:46.231
[clears throat]
I meant with your marriage.

08:46.264 --> 08:50.269
I would really like it if you would
come spend Christmas with us, Kenny.

08:50.302 --> 08:54.343
Um, I thought it might be fun to
go caroling together as a family.

08:54.376 --> 08:57.613
You can fucking catch me dead before
I goddamn go caroling, all right?

08:57.646 --> 08:59.443
That shit's for Christians
and retards.

08:59.476 --> 09:02.149
You've got lonely eyes, Kenny.
I can see it.

09:02.182 --> 09:04.916
[scoffs] Not lonely. Just went on
a fucking coke binge last night.

09:04.949 --> 09:06.051
- I'm tired.
- OK.

09:06.084 --> 09:07.546
While little Jack Horner
over there's

09:07.587 --> 09:08.816
sitting in the corner
being a bitch.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.783
You're not making
much of an effort, Dustin.

09:10.814 --> 09:13.182
- I'm here, ain't I?
- [scoffs] Isn't it funny?

09:13.215 --> 09:15.286
This played out exactly
how I said it would.

09:15.319 --> 09:17.455
You're gonna change your heart.
You're gonna wanna come back to me

09:17.488 --> 09:20.558
and by that time I'm gonna be rich and
famous, you little Christmas star fucker.

09:20.591 --> 09:23.355
See? What'd I tell you.
Rich or poor, Kenny,

09:23.396 --> 09:27.331
you're still an asshole.

09:27.364 --> 09:28.532
Whatevs.

09:28.565 --> 09:29.932
Merry fucking Christmas,
Cassie.

09:29.997 --> 09:32.300
Merry fucking Christmas.

09:32.333 --> 09:35.799
OK, everybody. We're going
to do a half speed rehearsal

09:35.832 --> 09:39.906
with the necessary adjustments.
You've been fucking up all day.

09:39.939 --> 09:43.245
And you're not that pretty.
You are not that pretty.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.413
- So you need to dance harder.
- [Jimmy] Hey yo.

09:45.454 --> 09:48.945
- Why we gotta sit way the fuck back here?
- And cue the music.

09:48.986 --> 09:51.418
- [holiday music plays]
- [announcer] Aw, yeah. Y'all know what it is.

09:51.483 --> 09:53.820
It's time for another
<i>Sports Sesh.</i>

09:53.861 --> 09:57.263
And now, your host,
Kenny Powers.

09:57.296 --> 09:58.899
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

09:58.971 --> 10:05.207
[music continues]

10:05.240 --> 10:06.702
- OK, that's not obviously far enough.
- [music stops]

10:06.743 --> 10:09.575
The fucking X
marks the spot, people.

10:09.608 --> 10:12.315
What the fuck? Can't I get anybody
who can do simple fucking wire work?

10:12.348 --> 10:13.451
Jesus Christ!

10:13.484 --> 10:15.954
Stage craft, people.
Come on.

10:15.987 --> 10:17.217
Back to one.
We're doing it again.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.752
- Back to one, people. Back to one.
- Jesus.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.754
Hey, Kenny, Kenny. Let me
holla at you for a minute.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.462
Jimmy, what the fuck do you want? Don't
you see I'm up here floating like a god?

10:23.495 --> 10:25.533
Come on. Shit ain't
gotta be that complicated.

10:25.566 --> 10:27.668
Yo, why can't we just have our
families on like we normally do?

10:27.701 --> 10:29.331
Because, Jimmy.
It's the 21st century.

10:29.364 --> 10:30.837
Everyone doesn't have
fucking families, OK?

10:30.870 --> 10:32.238
No more suggestions from you.

10:32.271 --> 10:33.838
- [clapping] Come on, let's do this.
- Yo, fuck you, man.

10:33.871 --> 10:36.341
Don't do that. Don't
talk down to me like that.

10:36.374 --> 10:39.212
Are you challenging me? Are you
motherfucking challenging me?

10:39.245 --> 10:40.709
I'm trying to talk to you
like a man, fool.

10:40.750 --> 10:43.247
Who the fuck you calling
a fool, huh? Me?

10:43.288 --> 10:45.918
You know what?
Fuck this shit. I'm out, man.

10:45.951 --> 10:47.854
I quit this motherfucker.
Fuck you.

10:47.887 --> 10:49.254
- Give me your parking pass.
- Man, fuck you.

10:49.287 --> 10:51.021
Give me your parking pass right
now, it's for employees only.

10:51.054 --> 10:52.556
- [Kenny] Goddamn it!
- [Jimmy] Fuck you.

10:52.589 --> 10:53.826
- [Stevie] I need your parking pass...
- I have never worked

10:53.859 --> 10:56.325
with a group of people
so unprofessional before.

10:56.366 --> 10:59.464
- In all my years of stage work...
- Kenny, man.

10:59.505 --> 11:01.439
You know, maybe you should
take some time off, man.

11:01.472 --> 11:02.712
Work on your marriage
and stuff.

11:02.736 --> 11:04.841
No. Hey, don't fucking
get involved

11:04.874 --> 11:06.979
in my personal business, all right?
Get back in line!

11:07.012 --> 11:08.917
Know your place, Rodney.
You little bitch.

11:08.950 --> 11:11.578
You know what?
Fuck you, man.

11:11.619 --> 11:13.385
- I quit.
- Rodney, you can't quit. Come on, man!

11:13.418 --> 11:15.387
This is the Christmas show,
man. What the fuck?

11:15.452 --> 11:16.820
You can't quit
on the Christmas show.

11:16.854 --> 11:18.827
- You give me your parking pass.
- Rodney, get back here!

11:18.860 --> 11:27.336
I need your parking pass.
Employees only.

11:27.369 --> 11:31.474
[upbeat music]

11:31.507 --> 11:34.947
[Kenny] Aw yeah. You guys are kicking
ass opening up these presents.

11:35.012 --> 11:37.885
Must be because you're so loose and
limber from that massage, huh?

11:37.918 --> 11:40.921
Little helper, why don't you bring
your little ass on over here

11:40.954 --> 11:41.952
and bring Shayna
another gift, please?

11:41.985 --> 11:45.352
Thank you very much.
All right, Shayna.

11:45.425 --> 11:48.687
I guarantee you Mom will not get you
anything as fancy as this shit.

11:48.728 --> 11:53.529
Woo. Look at that, huh?
That's from Tiffany's.

11:53.562 --> 11:56.202
That's the fucking jazz age
glamour collection.

11:56.235 --> 11:58.106
Look into little helper's
video camera

11:58.139 --> 12:00.442
and say, "I love Daddy
more than Mommy."

12:00.481 --> 12:02.808
- I love you more than Mom.
- Yeah, that felt real.

12:02.841 --> 12:05.674
Fucking, stop trying to François
Truffaut this bullshit, motherfucker.

12:05.714 --> 12:08.148
You ain't in the DGA. Just
zoom in and shut the fuck up.

12:08.181 --> 12:10.151
Toby, what's up with you?
Toby-Tobs.

12:10.184 --> 12:12.626
- You digging that Rolex, huh?
- Yeah.

12:12.659 --> 12:14.761
You don't seem too impressed.

12:14.794 --> 12:16.695
That shit was $6,000, son.

12:16.728 --> 12:18.792
That's rose gold.

12:18.833 --> 12:21.934
- I was hoping you would find Dakota.
- Dakota?

12:21.967 --> 12:25.736
You said we would have anything
we wanted and that's Dakota.

12:25.769 --> 12:27.504
Y'all are gonna sit here
and cry about a wolf?

12:27.537 --> 12:29.472
When I got Nobu
catering this shit?

12:29.505 --> 12:31.606
Seared ahi tuna,
wagyu beef tacos.

12:31.639 --> 12:33.036
I hired a goddamn dwarf.

12:33.076 --> 12:34.876
But why did he leave?

12:34.909 --> 12:38.477
Well... I don't know. I don't
understand the ways of the wolf.

12:38.510 --> 12:41.146
I just... Maybe he had
other cool stuff he had to do.

12:41.179 --> 12:42.713
You know?
He could be tied down.

12:42.746 --> 12:45.448
Maybe he's got big dreams.
Maybe he's meant to be a star.

12:45.481 --> 12:48.492
Did he leave
'cause he hated us?

12:48.525 --> 12:50.587
Nah, Toby. No.
He doesn't hate you.

12:50.620 --> 12:53.762
He loves you guys.

12:53.795 --> 12:55.492
Little helper, you're fucking
freaking my kids out.

12:55.533 --> 12:57.062
Get the fuck out of here.
Come on. Go.

12:57.103 --> 12:58.335
Go.
Get the fuck out of here.

12:58.368 --> 13:00.272
- [under his breath] Merry fucking Christmas.
- Hey!

13:00.305 --> 13:02.945
You want me to crack you
in your face?

13:03.010 --> 13:05.713
I'll smash your fucking teeth in.
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

13:05.746 --> 13:11.016
[holiday music]

13:11.050 --> 13:13.152
Children. This way.

13:13.185 --> 13:16.722
Quickly, quickly.
Come on. This way.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.523
Hey, Kenny.
What are you doing here?

13:18.556 --> 13:19.967
Hey, mind your own business,
all right?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.864
Don't start any trouble, Kenny.
Come on.

13:21.905 --> 13:24.335
Hey! Don't get live with me,
Gene. I know kenpo.

13:24.368 --> 13:27.173
- Back in your house.
- What is going on out here?

13:27.206 --> 13:29.270
Kenny! Why are the kids
wearing veils?

13:29.304 --> 13:33.281
Because, April, I'm a celebrity. I'm trying
to protect their identity from the paparazzi.

13:33.314 --> 13:35.418
- Did you guys have fun?
- [both] Yeah!

13:35.451 --> 13:36.985
Yeah, you bet your ass
they had fun.

13:37.018 --> 13:38.680
I got 'em every single thing
on their Christmas list,

13:38.721 --> 13:40.519
so good luck finding 'em
something they're gonna like.

13:40.552 --> 13:42.750
- That's so great.
- Yeah. I know it's great.

13:42.783 --> 13:45.223
Toby, would you please
take your sister inside.

13:45.256 --> 13:47.626
I wanna talk
to Daddy alone. Thank you.

13:47.659 --> 13:53.601
- Love you guys.
- [both] Love you.

13:53.635 --> 13:56.538
Here. It's something
I found at Marshalls.

13:56.571 --> 13:58.871
It reminded me of, um, you.

13:58.904 --> 14:02.009
Hmm.
I didn't get you anything.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.284
I mean, I just figured that the whole
tradition of buying each other presents

14:05.317 --> 14:07.453
was flushed down the toilet
like our marriage vows.

14:07.486 --> 14:09.882
You know I hate fighting
with you.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.755
Oh, I can imagine. I wouldn't
wanna fight with me either.

14:12.788 --> 14:14.460
I mean, let's see.
I whooped your ass at Christmas,

14:14.493 --> 14:16.230
and I'm whooping your ass
in this divorce.

14:16.295 --> 14:18.496
Just admit I beat you
and then I'll come right back.

14:18.528 --> 14:20.829
Why do you wanna come back?

14:20.861 --> 14:25.503
You were miserable.

14:25.536 --> 14:27.344
Maybe this is for the best.

14:27.377 --> 14:30.111
To be... just not...

14:30.144 --> 14:31.384
I mean,
just not being together?

14:31.407 --> 14:32.478
Yeah, well, I mean,

14:32.543 --> 14:34.345
you're pretty much driving
this train so...

14:34.386 --> 14:37.052
If you're happy in which the
direction the train is traveling.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.523
'Cause I already have said...
said things about me being happy

14:39.556 --> 14:42.121
so kinda seems like you're
the one who's, you know...

14:42.154 --> 14:46.995
Whatever. I'm not gonna argue over this shit now.
It's Christmas time.

14:47.028 --> 14:48.499
<i>Feliz Navidad,</i> April.

14:48.532 --> 14:55.371
- Merry Christmas.
- [door opens]

14:55.404 --> 14:56.538
[door shuts]

14:56.571 --> 15:03.612
- [keys clacking on register]
- [Kenny] Fuck.

15:03.645 --> 15:05.249
Goddamn it.

15:05.282 --> 15:07.048
This place is hemorrhaging cash,
Stevie.

15:07.081 --> 15:08.384
I'm going through
a divorce right now, man.

15:08.417 --> 15:10.818
I can't afford to be
wasting money on this shit.

15:10.852 --> 15:14.289
Just be patient, OK? Give Maria's
tits some time to work their magic.

15:14.322 --> 15:17.056
Only magic trick they're doing is
making my goddamn money disappear.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.425
It's time to cut our losses.

15:19.458 --> 15:21.392
- Girls, ladies, attentions.
- Wha...?

15:21.425 --> 15:24.831
Tits ladies. I am officially
closing Taters 'N' Tits.

15:24.864 --> 15:27.463
Please return your uniforms
to the appropriate offices.

15:27.504 --> 15:29.398
And you won't be getting paid
for today, I'm sorry.

15:29.431 --> 15:32.069
- You didn't finish your complete workload.
- Kenny, I need this.

15:32.102 --> 15:34.141
I am flat broke right now.

15:34.174 --> 15:37.278
This is the only chance I have to
give my family a good Christmas.

15:37.311 --> 15:40.145
The only one so please
keep it open. Please!

15:40.178 --> 15:42.585
Man, shut up about this money shit.
Don't blame me 'cause you went

15:42.618 --> 15:45.722
and Frankensteined your whole
face and blew your fucking money

15:45.755 --> 15:48.489
- on Maria's titties.
- I have done everything for you.

15:48.522 --> 15:50.320
I'm broke as shit
and you don't even care.

15:50.361 --> 15:51.560
You couldn't care less
about me.

15:51.593 --> 15:53.360
You didn't even let me
read your screenplay

15:53.393 --> 15:54.897
and I thought I was
your best friend.

15:54.930 --> 15:56.697
Oh, don't get your fucking
panties in a bunch, Stevie.

15:56.730 --> 15:59.034
I got lots of friends.
So get in line.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.371
You said that this
would make us rich.

16:00.404 --> 16:02.339
You said that this would change
our lives for the better

16:02.372 --> 16:04.274
and we just ended up
making our lives worse.

16:04.339 --> 16:07.107
Speak for yourself. I'm completely
happy with how my life is...

16:07.140 --> 16:10.042
You lost your fucking family!
What are you, a fucking retard?

16:10.083 --> 16:12.410
Are you a fucking
clueless idiot?

16:12.451 --> 16:14.386
I should've never
listened to you, man.

16:14.419 --> 16:17.452
I used to think you were cool. I
used to think you were a rock star.

16:17.485 --> 16:19.293
- Now look at you.
- Oh, look at me?

16:19.326 --> 16:21.030
Look at you, you look like
a fucking monster!

16:21.063 --> 16:23.324
Well, at least I'm not
the fucking Grinch!

16:23.365 --> 16:25.899
I am at the darkest point
in my life

16:25.932 --> 16:28.226
and it's all your fault.
And you know what?

16:28.267 --> 16:30.601
I quit. Fuck you!

16:30.634 --> 16:33.769
- [grunts]
- You clean those fixins up right now!

16:33.802 --> 16:38.244
You're a big boy. From now on, you
gotta clean up your own fixins.

16:38.277 --> 16:40.111
Let's get outta here.

16:40.144 --> 16:42.118
If you leave right now,
Stevie, I swear to God,

16:42.151 --> 16:43.486
this is it between me and you.

16:43.551 --> 16:45.781
Well, suck my dick!

16:45.814 --> 16:57.321
What the fuck
are you looking at?!

16:57.362 --> 17:00.223
[exhales deeply]

17:00.256 --> 17:01.592
[grunts]

17:01.625 --> 17:05.267
[hip hop holiday music]

17:05.300 --> 17:20.681
[crowd cheering]

17:24.954 --> 17:28.119
[announcer] Aw, yeah.
Y'all know what it is.

17:28.154 --> 17:30.288
It's a <i>Sports Sesh</i> Christmas

17:30.321 --> 17:32.362
- with Kenny Powers!
- [cheering]

17:32.395 --> 17:35.165
Woo-hoo-hoo!
Ho-ho-ho!

17:35.198 --> 17:37.964
Oh yeah!
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

17:38.005 --> 17:40.035
Hooo!

17:40.068 --> 17:42.707
Give it up!
Wonderful job, ladies.

17:42.740 --> 17:46.076
Wonderful! Lot of hot-ass
elves in the house tonight, huh?

17:46.109 --> 17:49.643
Woo-hoo! Go tuck yourselves in
underneath that Christmas tree, girls.

17:49.677 --> 17:53.282
Guess what, kids? I came all the way
from the South-motherfucking-Pole

17:53.316 --> 17:55.650
to teach you all about the
spirit of Christmas, huh.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.190
Hot damn.

17:58.223 --> 17:59.896
- Goddamn it. Fucking A, effects.
- [laughter]

17:59.928 --> 18:03.124
Goddamn. Feel like I'm in a damn
head and shoulders commercial, man.

18:03.157 --> 18:04.459
Kill the fucking snow.

18:04.492 --> 18:07.762
Come on! Cut it off!
Shit.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.669
Cheap-ass production design.

18:10.702 --> 18:13.175
Crock of shit.
But then again,

18:13.208 --> 18:15.541
Christmas is pretty much
a crock of shit, is it not?

18:15.574 --> 18:18.341
- [scattered laughs]
- Buying expensive ass presents,

18:18.374 --> 18:19.813
trying to outdo each other.

18:19.846 --> 18:23.382
You can buy fucking millions of
expensive presents for your kids,

18:23.415 --> 18:25.285
and what will they do?
They'll focus on

18:25.318 --> 18:26.980
the one goddamn thing
you didn't get them.

18:27.021 --> 18:30.558
- [laughter]
- You could be a perfect husband for years, years.

18:30.591 --> 18:34.156
Doing every fucking thing they ask you to
do and then all of the sudden one day,

18:34.189 --> 18:35.692
your wife wakes up and decides,

18:35.757 --> 18:37.457
"Hey, I don't wanna be
married to this dude anymore

18:37.522 --> 18:38.625
so I'm gonna divorce him."

18:38.658 --> 18:40.562
And now suddenly
you're the bad guy.

18:40.595 --> 18:42.866
That's how it goes.
Woo-hoo!

18:42.900 --> 18:45.529
Thank you, Santa Claus.
You fucking dick licker.

18:45.570 --> 18:48.365
- [chatter]
- Oh, you don't want me to badmouth Christmas?

18:48.398 --> 18:50.637
Well, how about this?
Christmas can suck this dick!

18:50.670 --> 18:52.301
- [boos]
- Fuck Christmas!

18:52.334 --> 18:54.069
No, don't boo me.

18:54.102 --> 18:57.437
Oh, you guys like Christmas?
