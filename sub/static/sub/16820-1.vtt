They're waiting for you
in the drawing room, sir.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.287
Thank you, Barnsby.

02:02.998 --> 02:05.877
Oh, Barnsby?

02:06.001 --> 02:10.131
I'd rather like you to join us,
if you don't mind.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.007
<i>[thunder]</i>

02:14.760 --> 02:17.434
Have you found Lady Ridgeley's jewels?

02:17.554 --> 02:20.774
Yes, Inspector,
have you found my cabochon ruby?

02:20.891 --> 02:26.193
No, Your Ladyship,
but I have found something else.

02:26.313 --> 02:30.284
The identity of Lord Fenley's murderer.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.083
Inspector, you're not trying to imply

02:38.200 --> 02:42.797
that one of us could have actually
performed such a loathsome deed?

02:42.913 --> 02:46.543
It's quite ridiculous.
I simply don't believe it.

02:46.667 --> 02:52.640
Not only do I believe it, Mr Montrose,
but I have the evidence to prove it.

02:53.715 --> 02:57.185
All of you had sufficient motive.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.272
It could have been... any one of you.

03:02.557 --> 03:07.438
You, Sir Derek, have been falsifying
the accounts of Finwick Industries

03:07.562 --> 03:11.362
with the help of
your son-in-law Mr Foxwell.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.905
And you were also aware

03:13.026 --> 03:16.906
that Lady Ridgeley
was having an affair with Lord Fenley

03:17.030 --> 03:22.878
which ended abruptly
when he resumed his dalliance

03:22.994 --> 03:25.838
with Lady Foxcroft.

03:27.833 --> 03:33.465
You see, she had stumbled upon
the knowledge that Barnsby was in truth

03:33.588 --> 03:35.431
Lord Fenley's half brother

03:35.549 --> 03:40.931
and the illegitimate father
of Mr Peter Montrose,

03:41.054 --> 03:44.775
who was planning to gain control
of Fenley Industries

03:44.891 --> 03:47.986
with the help of Mr Da Silva,

03:48.103 --> 03:51.983
who risked bankruptcy
if the plot failed.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.996
Yes, you all had motives.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.536
Any one of you could have done it.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.415
But only one of you did.

04:04.536 --> 04:09.133
A person sitting in this room?
At this very moment?

04:09.249 --> 04:14.801
Yes, Miss Kate, in this very room.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.886
This ridiculous cat-and-mouse game
has gone on long enough!

04:22.429 --> 04:24.272
Very well, then.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.942
Lord Fenley's murderer...

04:31.730 --> 04:34.449
<i>[audience groans]</i>

04:34.566 --> 04:35.863
[man] Oh dear, oh dear.

04:37.277 --> 04:41.032
Lights, Mr Paycock, please.

04:44.701 --> 04:48.626
I'll have it fixed in no time,
no time at all.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.966
I'd say that's highly unlikely.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.712
Oh, dear.
Now we'll never know who did it.

04:54.836 --> 04:58.636
[woman] It does seem rather obvious
who the murderer was.

04:58.757 --> 05:03.183
Who, Miss Marple?
Do tell us. Was it Sir Derek?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.725
I hardly think so, Miss Giles.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.895
It's unlikely he would have
murdered his business partner,

05:08.016 --> 05:10.269
not while he only had
49% of the business,

05:10.393 --> 05:11.815
and the controlling interest

05:11.937 --> 05:15.658
would have reverted to Lord Fenley's
sister, a bitter enemy of Sir Derek's.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.072
I'll bet it was
that young blaggard Lord Peter.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.161
Impossible, Major.
Excuse me, dear.

05:20.278 --> 05:24.374
The only tracks leading to Lord Fenley's
estate that evening were bicycle tracks.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.913
But he hated Lord Fenley.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.661
Yes, but you forget,

05:27.786 --> 05:32.257
young Peter had a birth defect which
caused a malfunction to the inner ear.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.844
This loss of equilibrium in his
system would have made it impossible

05:35.961 --> 05:38.589
for him to maintain his balance
on a bicycle.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.262
[Marple] Good night, Major.

05:41.383 --> 05:45.308
Excuse me, Mrs Morley-Smith.
Good night, Dolly.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.520
Good night, Jane.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.936
I still say it was that awful butler.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.731
It was Barnsby,
don't you think, Miss Marple?

05:51.852 --> 05:55.026
- I most certainly do not.
- But the revolver in his drawer?

05:55.146 --> 05:57.820
Barnsby had never been
to Lord Fenley's estate'

05:57.941 --> 05:59.943
The footprints
on the night of the murder

06:00.068 --> 06:02.662
led directly to the smaller bedroom
off the left wing

06:02.779 --> 06:05.157
where Lord Fenley
frequently sought privacy.

06:05.282 --> 06:09.082
Whoever killed him knew
how to go directly to that room.

06:09.202 --> 06:13.753
Well, then who did do it, Miss Marple?
Who murdered Lord Fenley?

06:14.958 --> 06:17.837
Why, young Miss Kate, of course.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.056
Why do you say Miss Kate?

06:21.172 --> 06:24.392
Because when the body
of Lord Fenley was discovered,

06:24.509 --> 06:27.888
the knife was firmly implanted
in the chest to the left.

06:28.013 --> 06:31.062
A right-handed person
would have clearly been unable

06:31.182 --> 06:33.810
to strike such a thrust
in that direction.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.654
If you'd looked closely,
you would have noticed

06:36.771 --> 06:41.823
Miss Kate was twirling her pearls
in her left hand.

06:41.943 --> 06:46.540
Good night, Vicar. I'm sure you'll have
this contraption running in no time'

06:46.656 --> 06:47.908
Good night, all.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.751
<i>[chatter]</i>

06:50.744 --> 06:53.247
She could be wrong, you know.

06:53.371 --> 06:56.420
She's not. I've seen the picture.

08:47.944 --> 08:53.201
I never would have guessed that ending.
That girl, she looked so nice.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.917
Human nature, Cherry dear

08:55.035 --> 08:58.915
The world of the cinema, the village,
it's all quite the same, really.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.301
[man] Listen to me, Marty.

09:03.418 --> 09:08.265
I don't care what those tea-guzzling
limey sons of bitches are demanding,

09:08.381 --> 09:12.352
those tea-guzzling limey sons of bitches
are gonna make this picture a hit.

09:12.469 --> 09:15.518
So stop playing around
and give them what they want!

09:15.638 --> 09:19.359
Look, I don't want to argue with you.
I'm the director

09:19.476 --> 09:22.980
and if I want three dozen
poker-playing kangaroos with PhDs,

09:23.104 --> 09:25.653
then you'd better damn well
go out and find them.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.653
- Do I make myself clear?
- [Marty] Absolutely.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.906
<i>- How's Marina?
- Marina? [chuckles]</i>

09:32.030 --> 09:33.452
She's just fine, Marty.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.668
- Thank you, Bates.
- Thank you, Bates.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.749
Mrs Bantry, I really must apologise.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.797
Marina's had to go for
a costume fitting up to town.

09:44.918 --> 09:49.173
Miss Gregg was particularly anxious
that I should tell you how sorry she is

09:49.297 --> 09:50.549
to have missed you today.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.096
Of course, I quite understand.

09:53.218 --> 09:56.267
By the way, what picture
are you over here to make?

09:56.387 --> 10:01.735
- It's called Mary Queen of Scots.
- Really? How very interesting.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.526
Marina was especially keen for me
to double-check with you personally

10:05.647 --> 10:08.241
all the arrangements
for the village fete.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.952
- She's terrified no one's gonna come.
- [chuckles]

10:11.069 --> 10:12.537
We are rather intruders here.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.531
My dear Miss Zielinsky,

10:14.656 --> 10:18.456
Miss Gregg's arrival has caused
considerable excitement.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.375
It's not every day
we have a real-life film star

10:21.496 --> 10:25.251
and her director husband living here
at St Mary Mead.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.128
Oh, Jason, we were just
talking about you.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.472
- Mr Rudd, Mrs Bantry.
- Mrs Bantry.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.635
How do you do?

10:31.756 --> 10:34.851
I cannot tell you how happy my wife
and I are to be in your house.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.723
Mr Rudd, you must get it out of
your head that this is my house.

10:38.847 --> 10:43.193
After the Colonel, my husband, died,
it was much too big for me.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.313
And I'm much more comfortable
down at the lodge'

10:46.437 --> 10:48.656
Well, I really must be on my way.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.572
- Would you like some more tea?
- No more tea, thank you.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.537
- Very nice to have met you, Mr Rudd.
- Very nice to meet you.

10:54.654 --> 11:00.332
No, no, no, please, please.
I think I can find my own way out.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.500
Please give my regards to your wife.
Goodbye, Miss Zielinsky.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.214
Mrs Bantry.

11:07.876 --> 11:11.926
- Where's Marina?
- Upstairs, out like a light.

11:13.089 --> 11:17.139
- Is she taking those damn pills again?
- Well, you shake her, she rattles.

11:19.053 --> 11:22.978
I want her to be happy.
God knows, she's been through enough.

11:23.099 --> 11:26.478
She'll be happy. Till she gets bored
playing the lady of the manor'

11:26.603 --> 11:27.650
Ella!

11:29.772 --> 11:31.069
Sorry.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.445
Don't spoil it.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.868

Miss Giles.

12:56.192 --> 13:00.038
- Afternoon, Major, Jane.
- Darling, Miss Giles.

- Who?

13:04.534 --> 13:08.755
Marina Gregg, the film star!
Really, Miss Marple.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.796
Well, I don't know anything
about film stars, Miss Giles,

13:12.917 --> 13:16.967
but if this gathering is
any indication of her local interest,

13:17.088 --> 13:20.308
I'm sure that Miss Gregg
won't disappoint her fans.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.517
I do hope not.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.228
I'm sure Mr Foxley, our dear postman,

13:24.345 --> 13:28.100

18:16.178 --> 18:20.024
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Do excuse me.
- Yes.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.518
Excuse me.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.361
Is this your first visit to
the United Kingdom, Mr Rudd?

18:24.478 --> 18:25.946
Why, no, I've been...

18:29.025 --> 18:32.120
[gasps] Oh, what a divine necklace!

18:37.742 --> 18:41.337
Well done, Mr Rudd.
First-rate show.

18:41.454 --> 18:46.506
Ah, Mrs Babcock.
Mrs Babcock is our untiring secretary.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.379
The Women's Institute
would be quite lost without her.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.471
I'm sure she's been wonderful.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.432
Now, Miss Giles. How about your cat?

18:53.549 --> 18:56.302
- I keep forgetting its name.
- Matthew.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.476
- [Vicar] That's right!
- [Miss <i>Giles]</i> Your dear wife had a cat.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.146
[Vicar] Yes, but it always
suffered from eczema.

19:02.266 --> 19:06.237
[Miss Giles] Carrots. Mashed carrots
and a little warm milk works wonders.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.951
Marina? Mrs Babcock, Miss Gregg.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.285
Miss Gregg, Mrs Babcock.

19:13.402 --> 19:17.282
- Mrs Babcock, lovely to see you.
- Oh, Miss Gregg.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.710
I know this is very silly,
and I'm sure you don't remember,

19:28.834 --> 19:31.087
not with all the millions of people
you meet...

19:31.212 --> 19:35.137
No, no, no, of course not,
How could you? It was ages ago.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.010
It was during the war.
I was in Plymouth in the Wrens

19:38.135 --> 19:41.639
and you came over to entertain
all those marvellous Gls.

19:41.764 --> 19:45.234
Oh, I remember it so well,
just like it was yesterday.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.525
[woman] I told you I lost my borage,
last year in the frost?

19:48.646 --> 19:51.445
[man] I'm sorry about that.
You know what to do, don't you?

19:51.565 --> 19:54.489
Cut it right down to the ground
in the...

19:54.610 --> 19:57.830
Oh, Mr Rudd, I understand
that you are a film producer.

19:57.947 --> 20:02.453
- No, sir. A director.
- ls there any difference?

20:05.705 --> 20:11.428
Yes, sir. The producer supplies
all the money, the director spends it.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.889
Then the producer yells at the director
for spending too much money,

20:15.005 --> 20:17.804
the director doesn't pay attention
and goes on spending.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.724
The director gets the credit,
the producer gets an ulcer.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.518
It's all very simple. Excuse me.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.642
<i>[brass band plays]</i>

20:37.403 --> 20:39.872
<i>[excited chatter]</i>

20:39.989 --> 20:42.617
<i>- [man] It's Lola Brewster!
- [woman] It is?</i>

20:42.742 --> 20:44.961
<i>[mar?] Yes!</i>

20:48.664 --> 20:50.462
<i>[woman] It is!</i>

20:52.001 --> 20:53.878
[man] Miss Brewster!

20:59.091 --> 21:04.222
Uh-oh. Mary Queen of Sluts
and Baby Bernhardt under the same roof.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.644
That's all we need.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.643
[woman] Miss Brewster,
look this way.

21:11.479 --> 21:14.733
Oh, I was so thrilled.
Absolutely thrilled.

21:14.857 --> 21:17.656
You were wearing that wonderful
blue sparkling dress.

21:17.777 --> 21:21.657
Do you remember what you sang?
I'll Be Seeing <i>You.</i>

21:21.781 --> 21:24.000
Oh, I was a mad fan of yours.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.461
How sweet.
How absolutely, perfectly sweet.

21:27.578 --> 21:30.832
Oh, but then
the most awful thing happened.

21:30.956 --> 21:34.335
Or I thought it was awful.
I was terribly upset.

21:34.460 --> 21:38.431
[Miss Giles] Do you mean to say
you actually met Clark Gable?

21:38.547 --> 21:42.723
Is he married at the moment or is it
just a rumour that he's a lonely person?

21:42.843 --> 21:45.096
- Jason.
- Is that the fellow with the big ears?

21:45.221 --> 21:46.393
- Excuse me.
- Oh, Major.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.982
- Lola's here.
- What?

21:48.098 --> 21:51.728
- Marty brought her.
- Why in the hell did he bring her here?

21:51.852 --> 21:54.480
I wasn't ill, just poorly.
You know what I mean?

21:54.605 --> 21:56.778
Then I had this idea.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.197
You see,
I didn't have a ticket or anything“.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.616
Save it for the Oscars.

22:01.737 --> 22:05.742
But this is the most extraordinary part.
You'll never guess who my uncle was.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.585
He was the stage door keeper.
Now isn't...

22:11.372 --> 22:13.795
Jason, darling!

22:13.916 --> 22:17.386
- My Svengali.
- Glad you could make it.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.881
Where is sweet Marina?

22:24.343 --> 22:27.062
Jason, baby. Nice spread you got here.

22:27.179 --> 22:30.103
I ought to spread you across this room
for bringing her here.

22:30.224 --> 22:35.196
Publicity, bubbie. That's what keeps
Martin N Fenn Productions in business.

22:35.312 --> 22:38.111
[Mrs Babcock] I was in the theatre,
standing in the wings.

22:38.232 --> 22:41.281
It was my first time there.
It was so exciting.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.450
Oh, you were wonderful!

22:43.571 --> 22:47.166
And when the curtain came down,
you gave me your autograph

22:47.283 --> 22:50.457
and you let me kiss you.
Oh, yes, you did!

22:50.578 --> 22:54.879
Oh, it was worth it a hundred times.
I've never forgotten it...

22:54.999 --> 22:57.343
<i>[sound fades]</i>

23:08.262 --> 23:12.312
I do believe it was the most
exciting day of my life'

23:23.444 --> 23:26.493
What a nice little story, dear.
Now what will you have to drink?

23:26.614 --> 23:29.709
Jason makes a wonderful daiquiri,
you'll adore it.

23:29.825 --> 23:30.872
Thank you.

23:33.287 --> 23:34.379
Honey.

23:34.496 --> 23:38.091
Oh, Jason, darling.
We'd like two of your special daiquiris.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.586
Sure. Are you alright?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.923
- I'm fine, Jinks.
- Are you sure?

23:44.048 --> 23:46.642
Yes.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.433
[photographer] That's great.
Thanks, Miss Brewster.

23:49.553 --> 23:52.022
Marina, darling! I didn't see you.

23:52.139 --> 23:56.315
Why, Lola. What a delightful surprise.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.359
You're looking as lovely as always.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.359
Of course,
there are fewer lights on than usual.

24:02.483 --> 24:05.202
In fact, any fewer
and I'd need a seeing-eye dog.

24:05.319 --> 24:09.620
Oh, I shouldn't bother to buy one, dear.
In that wig you could play Lassie.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.493
Same adorable sense of humour.

24:12.618 --> 24:16.293
And I'm so glad to see you not
only kept your gorgeous figure,

24:16.413 --> 24:18.461
but you've added so much to it.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.676
What are you doing here so early, dear?

24:20.793 --> 24:24.093
I thought the plastic surgery seminar
was in Switzerland.

24:24.213 --> 24:27.638
Actually, darling, I couldn't wait
to begin our little movie.

24:27.758 --> 24:28.850
You know the saying,

24:28.968 --> 24:31.517
"Once an actress,
always an actress."

24:31.637 --> 24:35.983
Oh, I do know the saying.
But what does it have to do with you?

24:36.100 --> 24:38.478
Cute angel.

24:38.602 --> 24:43.950
So do tell, how does it feel
to be back after being away so long?

24:46.944 --> 24:48.992
[Marina] Love your outfit, darling.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.865
Drink, Mrs Babcock?

24:50.990 --> 24:53.334
Mr Rudd is getting me one himself,
thank you.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.124
[Marina] What are you supposed to be,
a birthday cake?

24:56.245 --> 24:58.668
Too bad everybody's had a piece.

24:58.789 --> 25:04.011
- Can we have a big smile, ladies?
- Chin up, darling. Both of them.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.130
A little bit closer, please, ladies.

25:08.716 --> 25:13.187
Lola, dear, you know there really are
only two things I dislike about you.

25:13.303 --> 25:15.647
Really? What are they?

25:15.764 --> 25:18.984
- Your face.
- Thank you.

25:19.101 --> 25:22.731
- One daiquiri special.
- Oh, thank you very much.

25:22.855 --> 25:26.200
- I've never really tried one before.
- Enjoy it.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.829
- Here you are, my dear.
- Oh, thank you, darling.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.290
How are my two favourite <i>stars</i>
getting along?

25:33.407 --> 25:36.411
What are you trying to do,
give Marina another breakdown?

25:36.535 --> 25:39.004
Why would I want to do
a thing like that, pumpkin?

25:39.121 --> 25:42.500
Come on. Remember they used to grind
glass in each other's cold cream.

25:42.624 --> 25:45.423
One would only kiss the other
if she had viral pneumonia.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.297
They're professionals.
They take their job seriously.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.766
- So did Attila the Hun.
- Marina, baby!

25:50.883 --> 25:52.806
Oh, Marty, darling.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.726
How thoughtful of you
to bring Lola to my party.

25:56.847 --> 26:04.231
You know, I've always thought of Lola
<i>as</i> one of my oldest, oldest friends.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.355
<i>[chuckles]</i>

26:05.481 --> 26:09.987
Jason, darling, I'm certainly looking
forward to working under you again.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.531
Watch it, Lola.

26:13.655 --> 26:16.033
Jason, how about a drink
with an old pal'?

26:16.158 --> 26:19.207
- I only drink with friends.
- What am I, chopped chicken liver?

26:19.328 --> 26:21.956
Bad enough forcing me
to use your wife in this picture,

26:22.081 --> 26:25.005
but bringing her here with Marina
in the condition she's in.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.672
- Think of the picture!
- I am!

26:26.794 --> 26:29.638
- And the sanity of my leading lady!
- Bubbie, listen to me.

26:29.755 --> 26:33.100
She's gonna be fine.
I'm looking out for our best interests.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.140
[laughs] Our best interests?

26:35.260 --> 26:38.104
Hey, De Mille,
why don't you face reality?

26:38.222 --> 26:40.270
When was the last time
Marina made a movie?

26:40.390 --> 26:41.937
- The advent of sound?
- [scoffs]

26:42.059 --> 26:44.232
When did you direct a movie
that was any good?

26:44.353 --> 26:45.525
- Well...
- Listen to me.

26:45.646 --> 26:49.241
If Martin N Fenn wants to get
publicity for his two leading ladies,

26:49.358 --> 26:52.282
he's gonna get it,
without any dissent.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.656
Because the esteemed director
and his wife are only here

26:55.781 --> 26:57.124
because of his good wishes.

26:57.241 --> 27:01.337
And if he wishes, he can pull the plug
any time he wants, you got it?

27:01.453 --> 27:02.705
- Whoopee.
- Good.

27:02.830 --> 27:05.208
- So go and enjoy the party.
- You know what?

27:05.332 --> 27:07.005
- What?
- You're a bastard.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.675
Of course I'm a bastard.
I'm the producer.

27:09.795 --> 27:13.140
Oh, Mr Rudd. I believe I've reached
some understanding

27:13.257 --> 27:16.636
about the difference between
a producer and a director.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.559
But who chooses the leading lady?

27:19.680 --> 27:22.308
Whoever's sleeping with her.

27:22.432 --> 27:27.814
Er, Vicar, may I introduce
our noted producer Mr Martin N Penn'?

27:27.938 --> 27:31.067
I'm sure he'll tell you
everything you want to know.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.330
What would you like to know,
Vicar, baby?

27:36.446 --> 27:39.666
I'm sorry about your ulcers, Mr Fenn.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.036
What?

27:45.831 --> 27:48.960
Jason, we've got a problem upstairs.
That woman.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.131
Marina.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.242
[Cherry] Then the police came.

28:21.366 --> 28:25.041
They took everybody's name.
They kept us there for hours, they did.

28:25.162 --> 28:28.883
I just couldn't believe it.
I mean, she seemed as right as rain.

28:28.999 --> 28:34.347
She was only five years older than me.
There was an awful flap.

28:34.463 --> 28:37.262
Poor Mrs Babcock.

28:37.382 --> 28:41.103
I mean, she just had one drink
and about five minutes later,

28:41.220 --> 28:45.396
she sits down, sort of gasps...

28:45.515 --> 28:48.359
...and then she's dead, poor thing.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.195
What do you think of that?

28:50.312 --> 28:53.236
Don't forget under
the curtains, Cherry dear.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.993
- Miss Marple, I hope you don't mind.
- Mind?

29:05.035 --> 29:07.914
Well, me doing Saturdays
up at the hall,

29:08.038 --> 29:11.258
I did so want to see
all those film stars.

29:11.375 --> 29:15.346
- It's not going to upset you?
- No, Cherry dear. It won't upset me.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.511
In fact, it might even prove useful.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.009
Really?

29:20.133 --> 29:24.058
Put that duster away and sit down
and tell me everything that happened.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.682
- Well...
- Exactly as it happened.

29:26.807 --> 29:29.481
Well, I was moving about...

29:29.601 --> 29:31.945
Yes, of course,
but what precisely did you see?

29:34.856 --> 29:36.073
Well...

29:36.191 --> 29:38.694
<i>[Cherry] The whole village was there,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

29:38.819 --> 29:41.242
<i>And there was a girl taking pictures.</i>

29:41.363 --> 29:45.413
<i>Just about everybody. There was</i>
<i>Marine Gregg and her husband</i>

29:45.534 --> 29:48.413
<i>Oh, I liked him.
I think he's smashing.</i>

29:48.537 --> 29:51.086
<i>- [Miss Marple] Cherry, dear.
- [Cherry] Oh, sorry.</i>

29:51.206 --> 29:54.801
<i>Then the secretery girl came up</i>
<i>with Heather Babcock</i>

29:54.918 --> 29:56.920
<i>and Heather shook hands
with Miss Gregg</i>

29:57.045 --> 30:01.095
<i>and then she went into a boring old</i>
<i>story about how they'd met years ago.</i>

30:01.216 --> 30:05.847
<i>On and on she went. I thought</i>
<i>Miss Gregg was gonna fall asleep-</i>

30:05.971 --> 30:08.975
Honestly, she did go on, so.

30:09.099 --> 30:12.273
Then a few minutes later,
you served Heather a drink

30:12.394 --> 30:14.237
and not long afterwards, she dies.

30:14.354 --> 30:17.574
Oh, no. No, I didn't serve her.

30:17.691 --> 30:18.692
<i>It was Mr Rudd.</i>

30:18.817 --> 30:21.491
- One daiquiri special.
- Oh, thank you.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.158
Enjoy it.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.585
<i>[Cherry]
I don't think she really liked it.</i>

30:36.126 --> 30:39.130
Thank you, Cherry dear,
you've been very helpful.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.427
- [Cherry] Have I?
- Extremely.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.767
<i>- Oh, good.
- [knocking at door]</i>

30:43.884 --> 30:45.227
Oh, I'll get it.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.447
- [man] Morning, Cherry.
- Morning, Doctor.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.361
Morning, Miss Marple. How's the leg?

31:02.486 --> 31:06.207
Good morning, Dr Haydock.
You know, I think it's very much better.

31:08.033 --> 31:11.162
Shall I do upstairs now,
or finish here in the lounge?

31:11.286 --> 31:15.883
- This is the drawing room, Cherry dear.
- Sorry, drawing room.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.923
- Upstairs, I think.
- Right.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.797
Oh, later on, I'll bring you in
a nice cup of tea.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.896
Poor Heather Babcock.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.066
Mmm.

31:39.523 --> 31:42.367
She was a patient of yours, wasn't she?

31:43.610 --> 31:45.078
She was on my list.

31:47.739 --> 31:52.290
- Heart trouble?
- Nothing wrong with her heart.

31:52.411 --> 31:55.039
- Which does rather...
- Stick out your tongue.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.006
- Say "aah".
- Aah.

31:57.124 --> 32:00.048
- Put it back.
- Which does rather suggest poison.

32:02.963 --> 32:06.012
I think we should leave that
to the coroner, don't you?

32:08.427 --> 32:10.225
Glad to see you started my treatment.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.847
Treatment?

32:11.972 --> 32:14.395
Unravelling, aren't I right?

32:14.516 --> 32:16.985
You will have your little joke,
Dr Haydock.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.854
<i>[both chuckle]</i>

32:18.979 --> 32:21.823
You can't pull the wool
over my eyes, dear lady.

32:21.940 --> 32:25.615
Look at you. Your cheeks are pink,
your eyes bright.

32:25.735 --> 32:28.113
You're enjoying yourself.
Isn't that so?

32:28.238 --> 32:31.993
Dr Haydock, I would be very distressed

32:32.117 --> 32:35.496
if I thought you believed
that the only excitement in my life

32:35.620 --> 32:38.840
was predicated on the unfortunate fate
of helpless victims

32:38.957 --> 32:42.427
who somehow seem to fall into my path.

32:42.544 --> 32:46.299
Upon examination,
the deceased's body was found to contain

32:46.423 --> 32:48.425
massive traces of a barbiturate.

32:48.550 --> 32:52.851
Phenobarbital.
Unquestionably the cause of death.

32:52.971 --> 32:56.646
Had she a medical history for which
such a drug could have been prescribed?

32:56.766 --> 32:58.143
Virtually none, sir.

32:58.268 --> 33:01.989
Apart from chickenpox as a child
and German measles during the war.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.779
According to her doctor,
she was in excellent health.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.159
Thank you.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.085
Bearing in mind the evidence
we have heard,

33:15.202 --> 33:19.799
I have no choice but to record
a verdict of murder by poison

33:19.915 --> 33:23.510
at the hand of person
or persons unknown.

34:12.384 --> 34:15.103
- Dermot!
- Hello, Aunt Jane.

34:17.179 --> 34:20.353
My favourite nephew.
What a pleasant surprise.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.726
What are you doing here?

34:21.851 --> 34:25.481
- Why, I've come to see you.
- Or to enquire about Heather Babcock.

34:25.605 --> 34:29.280
What would a chief inspector from
Scotland Yard be doing in St Mary Mead

34:29.400 --> 34:31.779
if poor Heather
had died of natural causes?

34:31.902 --> 34:33.655
Well, he might have been passing by

34:33.780 --> 34:36.909
and suddenly had a craving
for some of your special peach jam.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.503
Now, Dermot, you know very well
I haven't made peach jam

34:40.620 --> 34:43.793
since Taphrina <i>deformans</i>
attacked my Russell reds.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.965
Now come and sit down
and let's have a little chat, shall we?

34:50.255 --> 34:51.882
<i>It was poison, wasn't it?</i>

34:52.007 --> 34:55.261
Aunt Jane, you wouldn't mind very much
I suppose if I anyway began

34:55.385 --> 34:58.685
- by asking the question, would you?
- [laughs]

34:58.805 --> 35:02.150
The poison was apparently
an American barbiturate,

35:02.267 --> 35:04.770
marketed under the name of Calmadon.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.647
It appears the principal ingredient
of it is...

35:07.772 --> 35:09.274
Phenylethylmalonylurea.

35:09.399 --> 35:12.369
I know it from my days
at Bridge Hampton Hospital in the war.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.238
Mixed with alcohol,
it causes respiratory depression.

35:15.363 --> 35:19.368
A drop in blood pressure.
Feeble heartbeat. Quite deadly, in fact.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.088
And you naturally knew the victim,
Babcock?

35:23.204 --> 35:27.129
Ooh, yes. Of course.
She was a simple soul. Friendly enough.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.299
A bit of a bore,
but you don't kill someone for that.

35:30.420 --> 35:33.014
If you did,
there'd be no one left in the village.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.350
<i>[laughs]</i>

35:35.467 --> 35:39.438
Well! So you're not being
much help, Aunt Jane.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.101
No, I realise that.

36:20.553 --> 36:23.477
So Mrs Babcock refused
your offer of a drink?

36:23.598 --> 36:27.228
Yes, she said Mr Rudd
was getting her one. I told you that.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.946
- And Miss Gregg?
- It's funny you should say that.

36:30.063 --> 36:32.236
- Funny?
- Well, not funny.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.530
Kind of strange, really.

36:34.651 --> 36:38.451
Go on, Cherry. Slowly.
Try to remember everything.

36:38.571 --> 36:43.748
Well, it... it was a sort of look
on Marina Gregg's face.

36:43.868 --> 36:50.046
What kind of a look?
Sad? Angry? Surprised? Frightened?

36:50.166 --> 36:51.509
I don't know.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.550
Cherry, dear, take your time.
Think back.

36:54.671 --> 36:57.550
Try to remember the precise look.

36:57.674 --> 37:03.147
Well, it was sort of... frozen.

37:03.263 --> 37:06.358
<i>[Cherry] She was staring over
Heather Babcockfis shoulder</i>

37:06.474 --> 37:08.852
<i>like she wasn't listening
to what she was saying.</i>

37:08.977 --> 37:10.024
<i>[Marple] Go on.</i>

37:10.145 --> 37:14.150
<i>[Cherry] She was looking towards the
stairs. There's a religious picture.</i>

37:14.274 --> 37:17.824
<i>Then Lola Brewster arrived with
her husband, the producer. Funny man.</i>

37:17.944 --> 37:19.992
<i>Wouldn 't be surprised
if he dyes his hair.</i>

37:20.113 --> 37:22.582
<i>The girl took a photo.</i>

37:22.699 --> 37:24.451
<i>Heather Babcock was rattling on</i>

37:24.576 --> 37:29.047
<i>and Miss Gregg had
this sort of strange frozen look.</i>

37:29.164 --> 37:32.418
What specifically was she looking at'?

37:32.542 --> 37:35.386
The people? The picture?

37:35.503 --> 37:38.677
- Obviously one of the people.
- Oh, why do you say that?

37:38.798 --> 37:42.302
Really, Dermot,
she sees the picture every day.

37:42.427 --> 37:45.772
Absolutely. I'm so sorry, Aunt.

37:45.889 --> 37:50.895
Er, now, how long did Miss Gregg
remain looking at that picture?

37:51.019 --> 37:53.113
<i>The Lady of Shalott.</i>

37:53.229 --> 37:54.321
Aunt Jane?

37:54.439 --> 37:58.990
"Out ﬂew the web and ﬂoated wide -
The mirror crack'd from side to side;

37:59.110 --> 38:02.785
'The curse has come upon me,' cried
The Lady of Shalott."

38:04.491 --> 38:08.041
Tennyson, of course.
I do have a weakness for Tennyson.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.835
And it does seem a rather
suitable description.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.378
Go on, Cherry dear.
Continue with your story.

38:15.210 --> 38:19.886
Nothing much more to tell, really.
Lola Brewster came up to Miss Gregg.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.680
I don't think they like each other much,
if you ask me.

38:22.801 --> 38:26.977
They had some pictures taken
and then Mr Rudd came up.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.348
He's so handsome.

38:28.473 --> 38:32.273
Cherry, we want to hear about
Miss Babcock and Miss Gregg.

38:32.393 --> 38:33.895
Did anything else happen?

38:34.020 --> 38:36.739
No, I don't think
I've left anything out.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.484
Heather spilled her drink
and Miss Gregg walked away.

38:39.609 --> 38:43.864
Spilled?
You say Heather spilled her drink?

38:43.988 --> 38:48.368
Oh, yeah. Oh, didn't I say that?
Oh, I must have forgot.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.211
<i>[Cherry]</i> I <i>am silly, aren't I?</i>

38:50.328 --> 38:54.003
- Oh, Miss Gregg! I'm so terribly sorry.
- It's perfectly alright.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.467
- Oh, will it stain?
- I'm sure not, I'm sure not.

38:56.584 --> 38:59.838
Here, you take mine,
I haven't touched it.

38:59.963 --> 39:00.964
Oh, no. I couldn't.

39:01.089 --> 39:04.514
Please, it's no problem.
I'll get another.

39:22.443 --> 39:23.490
So...

39:25.029 --> 39:29.079
...Heather Babcock drank
from Marina Gregg's glass.

39:32.328 --> 39:36.003
Fate was rather unkind
to poor Heather Babcock.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.798
Seems we've been dealing
with the wrong murder.

39:38.918 --> 39:43.264
I suggest you proceed to Gossington Hall
first thing in the morning.

39:43.381 --> 39:47.852
To put to use all those cunning skills
I've inherited from a certain relative?

39:48.928 --> 39:53.434
You know, Dermot,
you really are my favourite nephew.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.781
I'll let Mr Rudd know you are here, sir.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.666
- Inspector Craddock?
- Yes.

40:20.001 --> 40:22.174
Mr Rudd will be with you
<i>as</i> soon as he can,

40:22.295 --> 40:24.389
but I must warn you,
he's awfully tied up.

40:24.505 --> 40:25.506
Tied up?

40:25.632 --> 40:30.103
Inspector, have you any idea
what making a movie entails?

40:30.219 --> 40:33.063
We have wardrobe tests,
we have make-up tests,

40:33.181 --> 40:34.353
we have lighting tests.

40:34.474 --> 40:37.774
<i>- Rainbows End.
- I beg your pardon?</i>

40:37.894 --> 40:42.821
Yes, it was Marina Gregg's
first Academy Award, wasn't it?

40:42.941 --> 40:46.195
- Yes.
- I'll never forget that last scene.

40:46.319 --> 40:48.492
So vivid, real.

40:48.613 --> 40:52.493
Vulnerability, Miss Zielinsky.
Her <i>modus</i> operandi

40:52.617 --> 40:57.874
<i>Journey Home, Paradise Road.
Absolute conviction.</i>

40:57.997 --> 41:01.467
This indestructible ability
to make us care.

41:02.418 --> 41:06.924
- Now, they were facing this way.
- Inspector?

41:07.048 --> 41:10.177
[Craddock] I'm sorry.
The guests when they were introduced.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.348
Yes, that's right.

41:14.305 --> 41:19.106
Those eyes.
Violent. Mesmerising.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.774
It's a copy, of course.

41:20.895 --> 41:24.445
No, no.
I was referring to Miss Gregg's eyes.

41:24.565 --> 41:28.536
Yes, my earliest memory of those eyes
was in Tomorrowfis <i>Dawn.</i>

41:28.653 --> 41:32.078
She played a young socialite
heiress who came from...

41:32.198 --> 41:35.202
Now, where was it she came from?

41:35.326 --> 41:36.999
- Boston.
- Boston, that's right!

41:37.120 --> 41:39.999
She came from Boston
and inherited land in California.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.170
<i>Do you mind...?</i>

41:41.290 --> 41:45.090
Do you remember that scene where
they threatened to dig up her land?

41:45.211 --> 41:47.634
The way she stood up to
those gold-miners,

41:47.755 --> 41:51.885
that sweet, helpless young butterfly.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.855
Tell me, might I speak to her, please?

41:55.972 --> 41:59.351
- I'm sorry, she's resting.
- Oh.

41:59.475 --> 42:03.480
- Well, perhaps later?
- Perhaps.

42:03.604 --> 42:07.029
But sweet, helpless young butterflies
do need their rest.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.655
That snake-eyed son of a bitch,
Marty Fenn!

42:11.779 --> 42:14.282
He always did have the class of a toad!

42:14.407 --> 42:17.627
And he's putting up the money
for your comeback, so calm down.

42:17.744 --> 42:21.920
And putting that peroxide ﬂoozy
into my film!

42:22.040 --> 42:24.293
And <i>as</i> the virgin queen!

42:24.417 --> 42:27.967
She's in two lousy scenes,
neither of them with you'

42:28.087 --> 42:31.136
Lola Brewster, actress.

42:31.257 --> 42:34.887
If she's read the script,
I'd see a blister on her finger.

42:35.011 --> 42:38.732
It's your picture all the way. Nobody
will remember anyone else in it.

42:41.350 --> 42:43.569
Oh, Jinksy.

42:43.686 --> 42:47.316
- Do you really mean that?
- I'll make sure of it.

42:47.440 --> 42:50.660
Oh, God. God, it has been so long.

42:50.777 --> 42:55.499
You don't think there's
any chance I have lost it, do you?

42:55.615 --> 42:59.119
Oh, you'll be better than ever.
I promise.

43:01.079 --> 43:05.585
My love. You're so good for me.

43:06.667 --> 43:08.635
You always have been.

43:10.254 --> 43:14.760
Oh, damn her! That bitch!
If you look at her carefully,

43:14.884 --> 43:19.390
there's so many lines on her face,
you could drive a train on it!

43:19.514 --> 43:21.482
Maybe I won't shoot her
through a filter.

43:21.599 --> 43:26.070
- Filter? Try using an Indian blanket.
- [chuckles]

43:26.187 --> 43:28.155
You're gonna have to
dub her voice in too.

43:28.272 --> 43:34.029
Or write a line in the script that
Elizabeth is from Hoboken, New Jersey.

43:34.153 --> 43:36.201
<i>[sighs]</i>

43:39.158 --> 43:42.378
Bags, bags, go away-

43:42.495 --> 43:45.089
Come right back on Doris Day.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.544
<i>[phone rings]</i>

43:51.045 --> 43:53.719
<i>- Hello?
- [Marty] Jason, where the hell are you?</i>

43:53.840 --> 43:57.185
Lola's been sitting here for 20 minutes
waiting for you.

43:57.301 --> 44:00.271
She likes the feathers so much,
she wants them in the costume.

44:00.388 --> 44:03.517
I told her, a queen only wears feathers
if he lives in Hollywood,

44:03.641 --> 44:05.234
but she won't believe me.

44:05.351 --> 44:08.571
<i>Jason, you get your ass over here!</i>

44:08.688 --> 44:11.862
- I've been thinking, poopsie.
- Oh, that's a new experience!

44:11.983 --> 44:15.032
Maybe we should bring in Alexander
for my hair.

44:15.153 --> 44:18.999
Lamb chop, if I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times:

44:19.115 --> 44:21.459
Queen Elizabeth was bald.

44:21.576 --> 44:23.920
- Not in this movie, she ain't.
- It's history.

44:24.036 --> 44:28.792
So is Lola Brewster.
I'll be majestic.

44:28.916 --> 44:33.092
Awesome. Inspiring.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.509
<i>[chuckles]</i>

44:34.630 --> 44:38.760
I'm going to wipe that cow
right off the screen'

44:38.885 --> 44:42.480
Let's see, we're gonna need
some scenes with the two of us together,

44:42.597 --> 44:47.319
so the world can see
how much younger and thinner I am.

44:47.435 --> 44:50.735
Lola, baby.
Elizabeth and Mary never met.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.903
Oh, maybe they meet at the market.

44:53.024 --> 44:56.073
[chuckles] No, of course not,
she'd never do her own shopping.

44:56.194 --> 44:59.664
The beauty parlour?
No, they'd come to her.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.830
Wait a minute.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.329
I've got it.

45:06.454 --> 45:09.833
I come to see her
at the Tower of London.

45:09.957 --> 45:16.590
It's right before the beheading
and the rats are crawling all over her.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.809
She's in rags, looking like shit.

45:19.926 --> 45:23.806
And in walks... me.

45:33.314 --> 45:37.285
- Inspector, I do have things to do.
- Yes, of course.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.904
Miss Gregg and Miss Brewster,
are they very close?

45:40.029 --> 45:41.030
Close?

45:41.155 --> 45:44.250
If you put the two of them together
in a tank with a shark,

45:44.367 --> 45:46.711
the shark would have an identity crisis.

45:46.827 --> 45:50.172
Tell me, I'm curious, who's younger?
Marina Gregg or Lola Brewster?

45:50.289 --> 45:52.087
- Neither one. [sneezes]
- Bless you.

45:52.208 --> 45:53.755
<i>Oh. [sniffles]</i>

45:53.876 --> 45:55.002
<i>[sneezes]</i>

45:55.127 --> 45:57.095
- You alright?
- Hay fever.

45:57.213 --> 46:01.343
Those are maddening things, allergies.
I'm allergic to wool.

46:01.467 --> 46:05.222
I find a tranquiliser helps me.
I use a drug called Calmadon.

46:05.346 --> 46:07.599
- Do you know of it?
- We ship it in by the barrel.

46:07.723 --> 46:10.317
Oh. Does Miss Gregg take it?

46:11.602 --> 46:14.526
By the time this movie's over,
there may be a world shortage.

46:14.647 --> 46:17.275
- Do you take it?
- Do I have a choice?

46:19.777 --> 46:23.577
Ah, I think it must be very exciting
working for someone like Marina Gregg.

46:23.698 --> 46:25.871
I'm sure she's a grand person.

46:25.992 --> 46:30.418
Inspector, Marina Gregg can make
Medusa look like St Bernadette.

46:30.538 --> 46:34.918
- Why don't you change your job?
- What, and quit show business?

46:35.042 --> 46:37.465
I used to work for Jason
before they were married.

46:37.586 --> 46:40.465
I've learned to live with her tantrums
and her breakdowns.

46:40.589 --> 46:45.095
Breakdowns? But the image she projects
on the screen is so rational.

46:45.219 --> 46:46.892
Tell me about them.

46:47.013 --> 46:49.562
- It's all rather turgid.
- Really, I'm fascinated.

46:49.682 --> 46:53.357
Well, you can't mention illness
or insanity

46:53.477 --> 46:55.730
or anything to do with children.

46:55.855 --> 46:59.530
That's most interesting. Why not'?

46:59.650 --> 47:02.073
Inspector, I really can't go into it.

47:06.615 --> 47:10.165
I'm sure that Mr Rudd
is a tower of strength to her.

47:10.286 --> 47:14.883
- Devoted beyond the call of duty.
- And Mr Penn?

47:14.999 --> 47:17.843
Marty Fenn is a producer.
He only lies when he speaks.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.462
<i>[chuckles]</i>

47:19.587 --> 47:22.591
I should think they've been
pretty unsettled by the murder?

47:22.715 --> 47:26.436
Murder?
Inspector, we have a picture to make.

47:26.552 --> 47:29.271
We can't be bothered
by little local difficulties.

47:29.388 --> 47:31.436
<i>[door opens]</i>

47:31.557 --> 47:34.231
Ah, Mr Rudd.
Could I ask you a few questions?

47:34.352 --> 47:37.526
I'm in a rush. Talk to my secretary,
she'll arrange an interview.

47:37.646 --> 47:39.694
[Craddack] But I'm not a reporter.

47:39.815 --> 47:42.443
- <i>[phone rings]</i>
- Mr Rudd.

47:44.528 --> 47:49.250
Yes? Tell him I'm on my way, damn it.
Ten minutes!

47:49.367 --> 47:50.914
- Mr Rudd.
- I told you, not now.

47:51.035 --> 47:53.754
I'm Inspector Craddock,
Scotland Yard.

47:56.290 --> 47:58.543
Everything we're doing
is according to form.

47:58.667 --> 48:01.716
British crew, extras.
I've waivers on my two leading ladies.

48:01.837 --> 48:04.716
- We're in total compliance.
- If I might interrupt you.

48:04.840 --> 48:07.184
I'm sure you're going to make
a very fine picture

48:07.301 --> 48:08.928
without the aid of Scotland Yard.

48:09.053 --> 48:12.603
I happen to be here
on a minor matter of murder.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.476
<i>[Rudd] Oh, yes. Er, Miss...</i>

48:15.601 --> 48:17.228
Babcock, Heather Babcock.

48:20.022 --> 48:23.617
- I'm truly sorry.
- If I might talk to your wife?

48:23.734 --> 48:27.409
I'm sorry, no one may see her.
She's resting' Doctor's orders.

48:27.530 --> 48:28.747
If you'll excuse me.

48:28.864 --> 48:32.414
Mr Rudd, it's very important
that I talk to her.

48:32.535 --> 48:37.336
Inspector, my wife is about to start
the most important role of her career.

48:37.456 --> 48:40.756
Every ounce of energy is being
devoted toward preparing this role.

48:40.876 --> 48:43.095
She is going to win
her third Academy Award

48:43.212 --> 48:45.431
and I will not distract her with...

48:45.548 --> 48:48.142
Mundane matters like murder.

48:48.259 --> 48:51.559
- Whatever you say, Inspector.
- Jinks.

48:51.679 --> 48:53.773
[Craddock]
That's all very well and good.

48:53.889 --> 48:57.189
I firmly believe your wife
deserves a third Oscar.

48:57.309 --> 49:00.153
I think she should have got it
for Summer Rain, actually'

49:00.271 --> 49:02.990
But has it occurred to you
the death of Heather Babcock

49:03.107 --> 49:04.984
wasn't entirely accidental'?

49:05.109 --> 49:07.908
That the intended victim
was, in fact, your wife?

49:12.825 --> 49:14.873
Now may I see her, please?

49:14.994 --> 49:17.747
No, you may not.

49:17.872 --> 49:22.628
My wife has been through a lot and I'm
not only talking about last Saturday.

49:22.751 --> 49:26.301
I'm sorry, but you're not going
to give her a nervous breakdown.

49:26.422 --> 49:29.471
Now, if you will excuse me.

49:29.592 --> 49:32.391
[Craddock] I believe
she's had several all ready.

49:32.511 --> 49:35.435
- [Rudd] Several what?
- Breakdowns.

49:35.556 --> 49:38.435
- [Rudd] Who told you?
- I thought it was common knowledge.

49:40.144 --> 49:42.112
Ah, it's nice of you
to let them play here.

49:42.229 --> 49:45.073
What? Oh, the gardener's kids.

49:45.191 --> 49:48.411
I thought they might
have upset Miss Gregg.

49:48.527 --> 49:51.781
Alright, Inspector,
let's stop playing games.

49:53.157 --> 49:57.708
There was a time years ago
when Marina wanted children, badly.

49:57.828 --> 50:00.206
The doctors told her
she could never have any,

50:00.331 --> 50:02.800
so she adopted two.

50:02.917 --> 50:06.888
Then a few years later... She was
still married to her first husband.

50:07.004 --> 50:11.635
She found out she was actually
going to have one of her own.

50:11.759 --> 50:17.061
Unfortunately, the child
was born mentally retarded. An imbecile.

50:17.181 --> 50:20.902
Marina had a complete breakdown.
She hasn't worked since.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.270
I see.

50:23.395 --> 50:26.615
Now maybe you can understand
what this film means to her.

50:26.732 --> 50:30.282
That she actually has the guts to
appear in front of a camera again.

50:30.402 --> 50:32.325
Yes, indeed.

50:32.446 --> 50:35.495
This film's gonna turn
everything around for her.

50:36.951 --> 50:40.125
That's why if she ever found out,
even suspected,

50:40.246 --> 50:41.748
she was the intended victim...

50:41.872 --> 50:44.466
You don't believe the thought
has entered her mind?

50:46.293 --> 50:47.590
Not for a minute.

50:48.754 --> 50:53.225
The idea of someone wanting to murder
your wife doesn't bother you?

50:53.342 --> 50:56.846
You've been seeing too many
Charlie Chan movies, Inspector.

50:56.971 --> 51:00.851
Look, I'll be here the whole time.

51:00.975 --> 51:03.774
When I'm not, my secretary
won't let her out of her sight.

51:03.894 --> 51:06.363
- You trust Miss Zielinsky?
- Of course I trust her.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.824
She was there.
She had the opportunity.

51:08.941 --> 51:12.616
- Ella is devoted to my wife.
- And to you too?

51:12.736 --> 51:15.330
Jason, Marty phoned again!

51:15.447 --> 51:19.543
He said if you're not there in
ten minutes, he's getting John Houston!

51:25.791 --> 51:28.965
Will there be anything else, Inspector?

51:29.086 --> 51:32.306
<i>Is that the Martin N Fenn
who produced the Terror in Trinidad?</i>

51:32.423 --> 51:34.221
The one and only.

51:34.341 --> 51:37.390
I've always wondered
what the N stood for.

51:37.511 --> 51:39.138
No idea.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.142
How about "knockwurst"?

51:43.267 --> 51:47.898
- [chuckles] Oh, Mr Rudd.
- What?

51:48.022 --> 51:51.026
<i>I was really most impressed
with The Last Brigade.</i>

51:51.150 --> 51:52.993
Particularly, if I may say so,

51:53.110 --> 51:56.410
with your very subtle use
of low-key lighting.

51:56.530 --> 51:59.875
Why, thank you.

52:20.596 --> 52:23.190
Shouldn't you be resting that foot,
Aunt Jane?

52:23.307 --> 52:25.275
Old Edward's got his rheumatism again.

52:25.392 --> 52:28.896
I really can't let the garden
become like a jungle

52:29.021 --> 52:31.240
Do you think Mr Rudd
is fond of his wife?

52:31.357 --> 52:35.157
- I'd say he adores her.
- What about Miss Zielinsky?

52:35.277 --> 52:38.747
Business-like. Efficient.
Seemingly loyal.

52:38.864 --> 52:40.537
Suffers from hay fever.

52:40.658 --> 52:43.912
- Attractive?
- Yes, in a uncalculated sort of way.

52:44.036 --> 52:48.291
- That's a very austere assessment.
- Maybe, but what are you implying?

52:48.415 --> 52:50.088
I'm implying absolutely nothing.

52:50.209 --> 52:53.679
I just find your lack of emotion,
shall we say, a bit studied.

52:53.796 --> 52:56.800
Oh, alright.
If you prefer I were more direct,

52:56.924 --> 53:00.019
then I'd say that given the right time,
the right place,

53:00.135 --> 53:04.265
that Miss Zielinsky is probably...
hotter than a pistol.

53:04.390 --> 53:07.519
Hmm, perhaps
we should return to austerity.

53:07.643 --> 53:10.271
- Well, you brought it up.
- [laughs]

53:10.396 --> 53:13.741
Seriously, do you believe
she was telling the truth?

53:13.857 --> 53:17.907
Well, let's say, I think she allowed her
loyalties to become quite transparent'

53:18.028 --> 53:20.577
- Her feelings for Mr Rudd.
- Exactly.

53:20.698 --> 53:25.545
- A prime suspect, I'd say.
- Oh, would you, now? Well, well.

53:25.661 --> 53:26.833
Where are you off to?

53:26.954 --> 53:30.174
I'm off to the glamorous world
of movie making.

53:30.290 --> 53:34.921
I see this is not a particularly
taxing case for you, Dermot.

53:35.045 --> 53:37.343
<i>Show business is just
a business, Aunt Jane.</i>

53:37.464 --> 53:41.514
What we need is a little more business
and a little <i>less</i> show.

53:41.635 --> 53:45.435
In fact, there's a wonderful saying
I read not too long ago about Hollywood.

53:45.556 --> 53:49.606
"Underneath all that phoney tinsel
lies the real tinsel."

53:49.727 --> 53:54.153
- That's very profound, Aunt Jane.
- Better be careful, Dermot.

53:54.273 --> 53:58.244
They're liable to mistake you for Leslie
Howard and put you in the picture.

53:58.360 --> 54:01.705
Well, I do have a certain charm,
or so I've been told.

54:01.822 --> 54:03.870
Perhaps it's time
it was discovered.

54:03.991 --> 54:08.417
Dermot! First discover
Heather Babcock's murderer.

54:08.537 --> 54:12.383
Well, I'd better work fast
before someone else does it for me.

54:18.255 --> 54:21.099
<i>[man]</i> Shooting next time!
Let's have a shooting bell.

54:21.216 --> 54:23.560
- <i>[bell</i> rings]
- Very quiet, everybody!

54:23.677 --> 54:24.974
[Jason] Roll the camera!

54:25.095 --> 54:27.689
- [Jason] Speed. Mark it.
- [man] Forget the board.

54:27.806 --> 54:31.811
Lola Brewster, make-up test.
Take one. Board on end.

54:34.938 --> 54:36.531
Alright, Lola honey, turn left.

54:39.026 --> 54:40.653
Slowly.

54:40.778 --> 54:44.954
Lovely. Now hold it there a moment.

54:47.910 --> 54:49.662
Down with the chin a little.

54:49.787 --> 54:57.922
Up with the eyes. Good.
Now, keep the chin down. Lovely.

54:58.045 --> 55:00.389
Excuse me, gov. Could you check this?

55:00.506 --> 55:01.507
Yeah.

55:01.632 --> 55:07.639
[man] Dimmer on the key light.
Down a bit. Whoa.

55:07.763 --> 55:10.312
It's not dark enough.
Don't you have Italian blood?

55:10.432 --> 55:14.278
It's the stuff we always use.
Kensington Gore.

55:14.394 --> 55:15.737
It looks like water.

55:15.854 --> 55:18.528
Don't you people know
that blood is thicker than water?

55:18.649 --> 55:20.868
I want it thick like tomato juice.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.955
Excuse me, sir, could you have
a look at the guards, please?

55:32.538 --> 55:35.838
They're supposed to be the queen's
soldiers, not her ballerinas.

55:35.958 --> 55:37.960
Yes, sir. Leave it to me, sir.

55:44.007 --> 55:45.429
Now turn your head right.

55:46.635 --> 55:51.015
No, dear. Not your shoulders,
just your head.

55:51.139 --> 55:54.268
Right. No, dear. Your right.

55:55.394 --> 55:58.273
- Jason!
- Cut.

55:58.397 --> 56:00.445
<i>[man]</i> Save the red.

56:00.566 --> 56:02.785
<i>- Yes, my dear.
- [bell rings]</i>

56:02.901 --> 56:05.745
Lest we forget, you do have
an actress in this movie,

56:05.863 --> 56:08.412
one who also happens
to be married to the producer.

56:08.532 --> 56:10.330
No, I haven't forgotten.

56:10.450 --> 56:14.205
I think it's important we discuss the
queen's relationship with her father.

56:14.329 --> 56:17.378
When the picture begins,
the father's been dead over 30 years.

56:17.499 --> 56:22.005
Why don't you go to your dressing room
and put on a nice new costume, OK?

56:22.129 --> 56:24.632
I told Marty we should
have got George Cukor.

56:24.756 --> 56:27.179
Swords and blood,
that's all he thinks about.

56:27.301 --> 56:29.804
That and that over-stuffed psycho
of a wife.

56:29.928 --> 56:34.274
Will you get your paws out of my hair?
Where did you get this wig, Woolworths?

56:34.391 --> 56:38.612
Calls himself a director.
Did you see his last picture?

56:38.729 --> 56:43.826
I could eat a can of Kodak
and puke a better movie.

56:45.485 --> 56:48.864
Oh, why, you must be Inspector Craddock.

56:48.989 --> 56:51.959
They told me you'd be here.
How sweet of you to come.

56:52.075 --> 56:54.248
Miss Brewster,
I'm a great fan of yours.

56:54.369 --> 56:55.916
Isn't that nice?

56:56.038 --> 56:58.712
And I now you'll excuse me
while I change.

56:58.832 --> 57:03.258
Yes. Yes, of course.
Please, you carry on.

57:05.881 --> 57:09.761
Now, tell me, Inspector dear,
what's on your mind?

57:11.595 --> 57:15.816
I have a few questions regarding
the murder of Heather Babcock.

57:15.933 --> 57:19.187
- Who?
- The woman up at Gossington Hall.

57:19.311 --> 57:21.564
Oh, yes. Who was she, an extra?

57:21.688 --> 57:24.612
Ow! The zipper, you moron.
It's caught in my rump!

57:24.733 --> 57:25.985
I'm sorry, Miss Brewster.

57:26.109 --> 57:30.114
If I might digress for a moment.
I'd <i>like...</i> Oh, so sorry.

57:30.238 --> 57:34.038
...to erm, ask about your relationship
with Marina Gregg.

57:34.159 --> 57:37.663
Gregg? Gregg, that name rings a bell.

57:37.788 --> 57:41.133
- Come now, Miss Brewster.
- I'm just teasing you, Sherlock.

57:41.249 --> 57:43.126
Of course I know Marina Gregg.

57:43.251 --> 57:46.255
Isn't she that aging,
broken-down ex-star

57:46.380 --> 57:48.633
trying so desperately for a comeback?

57:48.757 --> 57:52.261
Here, try combing this out;
they may find Amelia Earhart.

57:52.386 --> 57:54.855
Now, tell me, Inspector dear,

57:54.972 --> 57:58.693
why don't you ask me
some more of those searching questions?

57:58.809 --> 58:04.191
I just love being examined,
especially by someone as cute <i>as</i> you.

58:05.774 --> 58:07.276
Erm, what I'm particularly...

58:07.401 --> 58:11.451
Are you really from Scotland Yard?
A real-life Inspector?

58:11.571 --> 58:13.198
I can just hardly believe it.

58:13.323 --> 58:15.997
A real-life Inspector
in my dressing room.

58:16.118 --> 58:21.090
Oh, just think of me as a...
what you call a cop.

58:21.206 --> 58:24.301
Only if you brought
your nightstick, honey.

58:25.836 --> 58:27.838
<i>[chuckles nervously]</i>

58:27.963 --> 58:31.684
- Miss Brewster.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I've upset you.

58:31.800 --> 58:35.850
Forgive me,
I promise I'll be a good girl.

58:35.971 --> 58:38.440
Now, about Marina.

58:38.557 --> 58:43.859
Well, what can I say?
She was a great star. Was.

58:43.979 --> 58:46.573
I mean, when I was just
a teensy-weensy little girl,

58:46.690 --> 58:50.445
my grandmother used to take me
to see all of her movies.

58:50.569 --> 58:54.790
And then about ten years ago,
around my 16th birthday,

58:54.906 --> 58:57.250
she had this awful collapse, poor thing.

58:57.367 --> 59:00.792
Drugs, alcohol, insanity.

59:00.912 --> 59:03.461
It's not easy
when you've hit rock bottom.

59:03.582 --> 59:07.758
Marty and I felt the least we could do
was to give her a part in my picture.

59:07.878 --> 59:13.430
- Yes, that's very charitable.
- Ow, not so tight.

59:13.550 --> 59:17.930
- Erm, Miss Brewster?
- Inspector?

59:18.055 --> 59:21.025
Wasn't there some kind of trouble
between you and Miss Gregg

59:21.141 --> 59:25.066
- a few years ago?
- Trouble? [laughs] Why...

59:25.187 --> 59:27.030
Whatever do you mean?

59:27.147 --> 59:30.447
When Miss Gregg began seeing Mr Rudd,
weren't you and Mr Rudd...

59:30.567 --> 59:33.912
Now, Inspector.
That's ancient history.

59:34.905 --> 59:37.579
Besides, Jason and I
were ending it anyway.

59:37.699 --> 59:43.047
I was only too happy to see
Marina find a little companionship,

59:43.163 --> 59:46.042
lonely and pathetic creature
that she was.

59:46.166 --> 59:52.094
Is that why you aimed and fired
a short-barrel 9mm Luger at her skull

59:52.214 --> 59:53.887
missing it by two and a half inches?

59:54.007 --> 59:56.760
- Did the bitch tell you that?
- No, Miss Brewster.

59:56.885 --> 59:59.513
The Beverly Hills Police Department.

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:04.939
Alright, so I got a little miffed.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.564
I may be a great star,
but I'm still human.

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:13.114
Human enough to try it again?
Only this time with poison?

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:18.491
- Are you insinuating?
- [knocking at <i>door]</i>

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.492
Merely exploring the possibility.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.585
Er, ready, Miss Brewster.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.711
Well, it seems
that I must take my leave.

01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:30.086
Thank you for our little... chat,
Miss Brewster.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.633
And jolly good luck with your picture.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:39.095
Miss Brewster, we're waiting.

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:42.644

I was just taking a walk
down to the village.

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:03.460
It's that way, ma'am.

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:08.419

What is that girl up to?

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.738
I saw you.

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:25.701
I saw you put the poison
in Marina's glass.

<i>[Miss Zielinsky] I saw you.</i>

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:35.795
Look, that part's been cast.
Why didn't you call last week?

You know about actors, don't you?
They all live up there somewhere.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:53.813
I knew a broad once.
I was making a Civil War epic.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:56.531
We were supposed to shoot
a big scene that day.

01:02:56.648 --> 01:03:01.870
She comes to me and tells me
she can't work that week. Know why?

01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:08.541
Because her astrologist...
tells her it's not in the stars.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:13.882
So, I, er,
pay this little creep a visit.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:16.923
I give him a grand, right?

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:20.843
[laughs] He tells her the stars
have made a sudden shift

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:24.343
and if she doesn't report to work
every morning on time,

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.640
she's gonna lose her sex drive.

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:29.230
The next morning
she was there before the janitor.

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:31.065
Won't you sit down?

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:34.903
- Yes, <i>fields of Glory,</i> wasn't it?
- Yeah, did you see that?

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:38.320
Yes, I found it a bit melodramatic.
It's not a very positive...

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.410
The only thing positive thing 
about it was the negative.

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:47.120
Inspector, what's on your mind?

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.743
Erm, how long have you known
Miss Gregg?

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:52.166
Marina? We've been friends
a long time.

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:55.666
Have the two of you been, 
er, intimate?

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.341
Intimate?

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:02.885
Yeah, we've been intimate.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:06.260
Everybody in Hollywood is intimate.

Erm, now then, about Miss Gregg.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:50.304
Let me tell you something about Marina.
Secure, she ain't.

Under all that jewellery
is a sad, insecure lady'

who might want to harm Miss Gregg?

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:00.363
Yeah, Hedda Hopper.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.327
No, I mean anyone involved
in the picture. You, for instance.

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:08.492
Me? I'm the producer.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:11.492
I'm coming up with $3.5 million
to make this movie.

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:14.039
You think I'm going to bump off
my leading lady

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.538
two days before I start
shooting the picture?

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:19.792
I've got contracts at Radio City
Music Hall for Christmas!

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:22.214
Unless, of course,
someone else bumps her off.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:25.930
If someone else bumps her off,
I'll prop her up and dub her

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:29.142
to get her at the Radio City Music Hall
at Christmas.

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:34.056
Harry, I want those pictures
up here right now.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:37.104

with Mickey Mouse,

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:39.444

the pictures up here now!

Excuse me.
Anything else I can help you with?

- Errn, yes. Oh, just one thing, Mr Penn.
- Sure.

01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:53.705
- I've always been curious about...
- What?

What does the N stand for?

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.754
You want to know what it stands for?

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:01.625
I'll tell you what it stands for.
Nothing.

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:04.719
But it sure looks great on
that big silver screen, doesn't it?

<i>- [laughs]

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:07.930

- Miss Gregg.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.728
I understand you were here earlier.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.227
I'm sorry for having
to make you come back.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:05.276
Please, please don't apologise.
I quite understand.

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:10.903
I hope you realise
the, er, chaos of film making.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.906
It really is rather
a wretched business, you know.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.078
I don't get to the cinema very often.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:20.082
Ah, of course.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:24.796
- Tea?
- Yes, please.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.510
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:31.806
- Milk'?
- No milk, no sugar.

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:35.894
You know, it's funny.
I never drank tea in America.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.058
Now I'm slowly becoming an addict.

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:43.109
Well, there's a little shop
in the village, Hedgeworth,

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:47.151
offers an extraordinary selection.
The most exotic brews.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.115
[Marina] Oh, I'll have to check it out.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:52.953
[chuckles] "Check it out."

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:57.370
You're probably thinking
how hopelessly American she sounds.

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:04.169
You're here about that poor woman,
aren't you?

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:08.214
Who would want to kill her'?
Do you have a clue?

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.678
Can you tell me about her'?

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.889
Me?

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:15.933
How would I know anything about her?

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.770
People said that the two of you
spent some time talking together.

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:25.484
Ah, well, she spent time talking,
I spent time listening.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:28.354
Can you be more specific, Miss Gregg?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:35.287
Do you know what fans are like,
Inspector? I mean, real fans.

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:39.158
No. Why don't you tell me'?

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:44.830
Well, it seems...

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.752
Let me think,
I want to get this straight.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:53.471
It seems we had met once,
years ago during the war.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.761
She remembered every detail of it,

01:08:55.881 --> 01:09:00.183
even down to the song I was singing,
the dress I was wearing.

01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:05.892
Funny thing is, I remember it too.

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:10.113
Anyway, I was entertaining the troops
and she was sick or something,

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:12.778
but she was determined to see me.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:17.904
And she got out of bed, got dressed,
got into the stage door.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:21.158
Her uncle or someone
was the door keeper.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:25.252
And she waited in the wings
until after my curtain call,

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:30.001
and I signed her autograph or something.

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:35.846
She said it was
the most exciting night of her life.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:41.602
And you know, it probably was.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.560
I'm so sorry. Erm, yes.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:55.113
I understand there was a moment when
you seemed startled about something

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:57.952
or maybe even frightened.

01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:00.029
Frightened?

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:03.624
It was about the time when
Mr Fenn and his wife appeared.

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:05.664
You looked at a picture on the landing.

01:10:08.996 --> 01:10:10.873
Oh, that.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:15.094
Yes, of course.
There... There was a moment.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.714
I was talking to that woman,
that fan,

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:20.888
and she was going on and on,
gushing.

01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:23.136
I was feeling run out of thank yous

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:30.145
and I just didn't know how to get
out of it and <i>I...</i> just went blank.

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:32.817
Miss Gregg,
I hope you won't find this upsetting

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:37.909
but can you think of anyone
who might want to kill you?

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:45.242
- Why do you ask that?
- I must explore every possibility.

01:10:47.827 --> 01:10:49.921
How do you get along
with Miss Zielinsky?

01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:52.836
Why are you asking these questions?

01:10:54.250 --> 01:11:00.007
A local woman was murdered.
What does it have to do with me?

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:02.975
I came here to make a movie.

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:07.268
I came here with friends.
I came here with people that love me.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:11.234
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:14.820
I'm trying to pull my life together.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:19.317
They're behind me. My husband, Ella.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:24.118
They won't let it happen.
They'll stand up for me'

01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:26.832
Why are you doing this? Why?

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.084
Oh, God!

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:37.636
It was me, wasn't it?

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:41.928
It was me they were trying to poison,
wasn't it'?

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:47.762
Who am I kidding?

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:53.397
Somebody is trying to kill me,
aren't they?

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:58.106
Somebody is trying to... poison me,
aren't they?

01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:00.905
Somebody is trying to kill me,
aren't they?

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:03.278
Aren't they? I know it! I can...

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:07.123
"I can feel it.
I can almost hear them coming."

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.558
I bet you've seen
every one of my movies.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:32.683
- Oh, at least twice.
- [chuckles]

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.150
That one was a real dog.

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:37.362
But you were most compelling
in that scene, though

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:39.901
The critics didn't seem to think so.

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:41.399
If they'd been here today,

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:44.277
I'm absolutely certain
they would have succumbed.

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:48.155
You didn't.

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:51.750
Well, I'm a detective, Miss Gregg.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:55.589
It's my job to analyse behaviour
off screen.

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:59.425
Well, I'm an actress. I act.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:04.764
Yes, I think the performance
was a little overdone, if I may say.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.304
I would have settled
for simple sincerity.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.182
I didn't think you'd believe me.

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.944
I still don't think you believe me.

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.668
"You won't escape next time."

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:43.965
"Prepare to die."

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:47.056
One came here,
the other was sent to the studio.

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:49.767
- When?
- This morning.

01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:51.852
- Who delivered them?
- We don't know.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:55.439
- We?
- My husband and I.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:58.560
At first I thought it was a joke.

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:01.778
Some kind of joke, huh?

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:13.833
I don't think I've been so scared
since I was a kid in Oklahoma City.

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:21.670
Shirley Bookbinder.
Prettiest little girl in town.

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:25.887
I really thought I was something.

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:33.641
Till one day I found...
I think I was around ten.

01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:38.483
I found in my desk a note saying...

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:44.321
"Nobody likes you, Shirley."

01:14:47.274 --> 01:14:49.493
I cried for three days.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:55.791
I never did find out who wrote it.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:05.551
See, the tough thing about having it,

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:09.423
there's always somebody
who wants to take it away.

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:16.896
And you know, they usually do.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:25.237
Help me, Inspector, please.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:32.078
- And I'm sure you will, Dermot.
- Well, I'll certainly try.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:35.824
I suspect you're rather smitten
with Miss Bookbinder.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.871
Nonsense, Aunt Jane.

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:40.498
Trouble is, of course,

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:44.374
I now have enough suspects
with enough motives

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.967
to fill every shop in this high street.

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:51.305
Please make sure that you
and little Jeremy John

01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:54.016
and the godparents are on time,

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:58.559
because at 3:30 I have Mrs Cracknell
and her little Jeremy John.

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:03.355
No, no, that's wrong. Mrs Cracknell's
little Michael Jeremy John.

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:05.979
No, that's wrong too.
Mrs Michael's John.

01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:08.526
No, that's not right either.

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:13.278
So confusing.
But I must get it right, mustn't I?

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:16.702
Well, see you Saturday, 3:30.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:21.794
Ah, Miss Marple! Great news!

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:27.338
Mr Edwards down at the garage
has been able to diagnose the problem.

01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:31.179
We shall, therefore, hopefully no longer
have to call upon you

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:35.801
to resolve next Friday night's
little extravaganza, Two <i>Girls</i> from...

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:39.270
I've forgotten where.
But I do hope to see you anyway.

01:16:39.386 --> 01:16:41.138
Somewhere in America I'm sure.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:44.688
Idaho. You can safely
give that one a miss, Aunt Jane.

01:16:44.809 --> 01:16:46.777
[Miss Marple] If you say so, Dermot.

01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:52.070
Jamie.

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:54.740
Oh, Jamie.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:58.952
How I've longed for you.

01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:04.955
To take you in my arms
and to clasp you to my bosom.

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:10.509
Jason, will you get that creep
out of my eye line?

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.254
- Cut.
- Who? Who, me?

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:15.347
Was I in your eye line?

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:19.264
Oh, but I just wanted Jason
to see my costume.

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:23.686
Dear, will you put the virgin queen
back into her cage?

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:27.936
Lola, why don't you go study your lines?

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.939
Anything you say.

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:33.942
Anybody got a script breakdown?

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:37.320
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:39.993
I shouldn't have used that word.

01:17:48.038 --> 01:17:50.006
<i>- Tee's up!
- [bell rings]</i>

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:51.967
Don't all rush. Plenty to go round.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:55.964
Don't walk in front of the camera,
for goodness' sake! Load of animals.

01:17:57.631 --> 01:17:59.053
Are you OK?

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.266
Hmm?

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.774
I'm fine, Jinks.

01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:10.773
That's my girl.

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:13.114
Excuse me.

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:17.785
- Coffee, Marina.
- Oh, thank you.

01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:19.324
Jason, shall I get you a cup?

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:23.200
Could you come and look at this?
See if you can strike it? Thanks'

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.162
Thank you.

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:35.928
Jason, when do I get to play
my scene with Sir Walter Raleigh?

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:38.844
- What?
- Jason! Jason!

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.428
- What is it?
- The...

01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:46.601
The coffee.

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:54.443
There's nothing wrong with it,
it's just a little strong.

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.110
- You're lying.
- Honey, come on.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:59.031
You're lying! It's poisoned!

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:19.089
[Cherry] I'll see you in the morning,
Miss Marple. I've laid everything out.

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:21.887
And don't forget,
I left your dinner in the oven.

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.884
[Miss Marple] Thank you, Cherry dear.

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:54.048
<i>[rings]</i>

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:55.837
<i>[inserts coin]</i>

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.510
Remember me?

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:02.427
I saw you, murderer.

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:18.022
Good evening, miss.
Mr Rudd has been asking for you.

01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:21.988
<i>[sneezes]</i>

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.670

<i>- [Jason] Where have you been?

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.553
I've been out for a walk.

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:53.557
What's the matter with you?
You look terrible.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:21:01.654
The coffee Marina
almost drank on the set.

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:03.026
I had it analysed.

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:07.450
- Arsenic.
- Arsenic?

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:11.909
- How?
- I'm asking you.

01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:14.913
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You made it, you poured it.

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:18.883
- You gave it to her.
- Do you think I tried to poison her?

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:21.127
Yes!

01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:23.345
No. I don't know.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:26.591
I don't know what to think.

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:36.267
You really do love her,
don't you, Jason?

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:44.241
Don't worry, I'm sure they'll find him.

01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:49.580
- Him?
- Whoever did it.

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:52.908
<i>[sneezes]</i>

01:21:53.033 --> 01:21:56.128
Oh, for God's sake,
do something about that cold.

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:13.975
<i>[sniffs]</i>

01:22:55.762 --> 01:22:57.981
- [Craddock] ls the doctor here?
- Yes, sir.

01:22:58.098 --> 01:23:01.443
Mr Rudd called the station at 8:55, sir.

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:16.075
You'll have my report in the morning.

01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:21.042
Alright, girls, you can go now.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:25.134
Bates, if you'll stay, Constable Arnold
will take your statement now.

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:36.763
Inspector, who would want to kill her?

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.645
The same person
that tried to poison your wife.

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:47.069
Did you know that Miss Zielinsky
was making a series of phone calls

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:49.283
from the box in the village?

01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:55.202
She was apparently playing detectives.
Phoning every suspect.

01:23:55.322 --> 01:23:58.292
Telling them that she'd seen them
poison Miss Gregg.

01:23:58.408 --> 01:24:00.502
Waiting for a reaction.

01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:05.967
If whoever she was talking to had
took the bait, she'd find the murderer.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:09.174
She obviously did.

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:18.812
You've seen the coffee analysis?

01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:24.732
Yes. Mr Rudd, why didn't you
tell me about these notes?

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:34.111
I obviously forgot about them.

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:39.450
Somebody threatened to kill your wife
and you forgot?

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:46.083
- I thought I could handle it.
- Not very effectively, it seems.

01:24:58.218 --> 01:25:00.346
What are you doing?

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:03.314
- I'm getting out of here.
- Marina.

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:06.561
I'm sorry, Jason,
but I'm not staying here another night.

01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:09.438
- What about the picture?
- To hell with the picture!

01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:11.861
Somebody out there
is trying to kill me.

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:15.737
- Think I'm gonna sit and wait for them?
- No one is going to hurt you.

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:23.248
- Oh, Jinks. I'm so scared!
- I know, I know.

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:26.872
But I'm here with you.
The police are on guard.

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:30.547
Why? Why would somebody
want to hurt me?

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:32.761
Shh.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.633
Why didn't you tell me
about those notes?

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:44.477
What's the point?
Scare the hell out of you too?

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:46.271
Please, let's get out of here.

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:53.115
OK, we'll check into a hotel
in the morning.

01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:57.111
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:59.283
And we'll be together always.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:02.078
Till death do us part.

01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:04.076
Why'd you say that?

01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:10.625
Seems we can eliminate
Miss Zielinsky as a suspect.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:13.127
Murder is a very dangerous business.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:18.052
If one gets mixed up in it, one must
be prepared for the consequences.

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:20.267
She wasn't a pretty sight.

01:26:20.384 --> 01:26:23.809
Prussic acid
is a most unpleasant death.

01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:28.145
So, where do we go from here, Aunt Jane?

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:31.236
Our most likely suspecfs
become our latest victim.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:34.106
Do you realise there were
at least 40 people at that party

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:36.905
and no one saw the poison
being put into the glass?

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:40.746
Come now, Dermot. At least three people
could have quite easily.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:44.207
One, the unobservant soul
preoccupied with other thoughts,

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:47.043
- completely unaware of what he saw.
- Hmm, second?

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.834
The person who may have seen it
and thought nothing of it

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:51.582
because it seemed quite natural.

01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:53.801
In my day,
it was considered bad manners,

01:26:53.917 --> 01:26:56.841
but people today are always
putting things in their drinks.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:27:00.808
- Pills, medicine. All sorts of things.
- I suppose. And third?

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:03.473
We have the person
who actually did it.

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:05.812
The same person
who murdered Ella Zielinsky.

01:27:05.929 --> 01:27:11.106
Exactly. You know, Dermot, I always
think that murder is like a jigsaw.

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:15.823
Until you've fitted in the final piece,
you can't see the whole picture.

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:19.364
Obviously,
we still have a piece missing.

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:31.540
Now, what was that awful women's name?
Brown boots, sort of Cheltenham type.

01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:34.291
- Colethorpe.
- Cynthia Colethorpe, right.

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:37.636
And I distinctly remember it
wasn't till halfway through the case

01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:40.597
when you reminded me about
her smelly little Pekingese.

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:43.843
What was its name?
It smelt revoltingly.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.145
Aunt Jane?

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:56.943
Frozen. That frozen look.

01:27:58.398 --> 01:28:01.368
What was it that Heather Babcock
said to Marina Gregg

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:04.705
just before she gave the frozen look?

01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:08.792
You mean all that interminable nonsense
about how she was ill?

01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:10.877
Marina gave her an autograph

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:13.543
and it was
the most exciting moment of her life.

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:16.212
Yes, it was before
she spilled the drink.

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:19.052
- Here it is.
- It's not good enough.

01:28:19.169 --> 01:28:21.672
We've got to know Heather's exact words.

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:24.641
I'm not sure that I follow you.

01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:28.937
- Alice Wetherby's cousin.
- Alice Wetherby's cousin?

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:32.684
She went into a back room one day
and found her husband had hung himself

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.527
from a hook at the top of the ceiling
eight feet high'

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:39.114
There was absolutely nothing else in
the room except the hook, the body

01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:41.529
and a small puddle of water
beneath his feet.

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:45.371
Nobody could understand how he'd
manoeuvred himself to perform the deed,

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:48.741
until it was discovered
he had purchased a two-foot block of ice

01:28:48.865 --> 01:28:52.335
from the local fishmonger, 
Mr Croswell.

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:55.251
To this day,
Alice Wetherby's cousin shudders

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:58.091
at the mere suggestion
of an ice cube in her gin.

01:29:02.045 --> 01:29:03.342
Yes, Aunt Jane.

01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:04.806
Don't you see, Dermot?

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:08.518
Something as trivial as
the suggestion of an ice cube

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:11.354
when it becomes associated
with another experience,

01:29:11.471 --> 01:29:13.394
something that caused great grief,

01:29:13.515 --> 01:29:16.064
it fixes in the mind,
stays with you forever.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.740
Yes, but I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:24.861
If only we knew what
Heather actually said.

01:29:32.993 --> 01:29:34.711
Cherry!

01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:39.083
Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible.
At least for now. I've sent her away.

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:40.584
Whatever for?

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:44.464
Dear boy,
I don't want her to be murdered too.

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:20.674
Marina, honey.
I brought you something warm to drink.

01:30:25.795 --> 01:30:28.389
Hot chocolate.

01:30:28.506 --> 01:30:34.684
Do you remember when we used to drink it
on those cold nights in Sun Valley?

01:30:34.804 --> 01:30:36.727
When there was nothing else to do.

01:30:38.141 --> 01:30:39.859
I mean, afterwards.

01:30:54.074 --> 01:30:55.496
Sleep tight.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:03.132
I'll take these.

01:31:04.376 --> 01:31:06.674
You won't be needing them any more.

01:31:11.675 --> 01:31:13.894
Jason?

01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:15.887
Hmm?

01:31:18.556 --> 01:31:22.481
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:05.737
<i>[church bells toll]</i>

01:32:12.652 --> 01:32:14.780
<i>[cat meows]</i>

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:49.440
<i>[Miss Marple breathes heavily]</i>

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:19.679
Of course, the vicar!

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:05.940
Thank you, Inch.
If you'll wait, please.

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:24.167
I'm sorry, Miss Marple,
Miss Gregg is not available.

01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:27.037
But it is imperative
that I see her at once.

01:34:27.162 --> 01:34:30.006
My apologies, madam. I have my orders.

01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:37.927
Then I shall wait.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:47.141
- There is a lady here, sir.
- What kind of a lady?

01:34:47.265 --> 01:34:49.063
A somewhat elderly lady, sir.

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:52.734
A Miss Marple.
She refuses to leave. Shall I...'?

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:55.573
No. I'll get rid of her.

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:08.036
Mr Rudd. Good morning, Mr Rudd.

01:35:08.161 --> 01:35:11.415
Look, Miss, er, Marble,
or whatever your name is,

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:14.509
I don't know what you're doing here,
but you cannot stay.

01:35:14.626 --> 01:35:17.926
It's Marple, and I won't keep you long.
I'm correct, am I not,

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:20.720
that that is where your wife stood
the day of the murder?

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:25.311
She looked in that direction
and then her face froze.

01:35:25.428 --> 01:35:27.430
I think you'd better leave.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:31.059
<i>Bellini's Mother and Child.
A very fine painting.</i>

01:35:31.184 --> 01:35:34.814
A present of the Brera Institute
in Milano, I believe.

01:35:34.938 --> 01:35:39.819
The whole thing
is really quite simple, isn't it?

01:35:39.943 --> 01:35:41.911
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:35:42.028 --> 01:35:44.030
I think you do.

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:47.580
- [Miss Marple] Ah, Dermot.
- Good Lord, Aunt Jane.

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.577
I might have guessed you'd be here.

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:53.211
This is the spot where it happened,

01:35:53.331 --> 01:35:58.007
which makes it
so much easier to understand.

01:35:58.127 --> 01:36:03.509
It's very simple, if only
one looks at it the proper way.

01:36:03.633 --> 01:36:07.683
It all began, you see, with the kind
of person that Heather Babcock was.

01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:10.227
Damn it, that's enough!

01:36:10.348 --> 01:36:14.478
The two of you come busting
into my house. I want you out. Now!

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:17.230
Perhaps you should call the police,
Mr Rudd.

01:36:17.355 --> 01:36:18.982
Let us go back, shall we,

01:36:19.107 --> 01:36:21.906
<i>to the moment when</i>
<i>Heather greets Miss Gregg</i>

01:36:22.026 --> 01:36:24.620
<i>and launches into
her efiusive little tale?</i>

01:36:24.737 --> 01:36:28.037
<i>Poor Miss Gregg listened patiently
as Heather rattled on,</i>

01:36:28.157 --> 01:36:29.704
<i>or at least she appeared to.</i>

01:36:29.826 --> 01:36:35.674
<i>And then suddenly
Marina turned her head away.</i>

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:40.136
<i>A strange look came over her face.
A look of doom.</i>

01:36:40.253 --> 01:36:43.598
It had nothing to do
with Lola Brewster's arrival.

01:36:43.715 --> 01:36:47.219
Marina wasn't even looking at her
or poor Heather.

01:36:47.343 --> 01:36:50.187
She was looking at the Madonna.

01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:56.778
A picture of a serene mother
holding a beautiful happy baby.

01:36:58.438 --> 01:37:00.315
I still don't see the connection.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.865
Of course not, you don't know
what Heather actually said.

01:37:03.985 --> 01:37:07.205
Yes, but haven't we
been through all that last night?

01:37:07.322 --> 01:37:09.290
<i>She got out of bed, powdered her nose,</i>

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:13.207
<i>slipped out of the barracks
determined to see her idol</i>

01:37:13.328 --> 01:37:16.628
<i>then proceeded to the theatre
where some relative let her in</i>

01:37:16.748 --> 01:37:18.921
<i>and allowed her to watch
from the wings.</i>

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:24.969
<i>[cheering]</i>

01:38:06.756 --> 01:38:09.009
I still don't see where that gets us.

01:38:09.133 --> 01:38:11.932
Neither did I.
And then I thought of the vicar.

01:38:13.262 --> 01:38:17.438
I telephoned him in the middle
of the night. I wasn't at all popular.

01:38:17.558 --> 01:38:21.153
He remembered Heather's convalescence.

01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:24.900
She had been ill and spent her sick
leave in the village with her mother.

01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:26.241
You see,

01:38:26.359 --> 01:38:29.488
<i>when Heather Babcock
went to the theatre that evening,</i>

01:38:29.612 --> 01:38:31.580
<i>she was infectious.</i>

01:38:31.697 --> 01:38:35.247
<i>She was suffering from rubella.</i>

01:38:35.368 --> 01:38:38.793
<i>More commonly known
as German measles.</i>

01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:55.100
Your wife had a child
that was born mentally retarded.

01:38:55.221 --> 01:38:57.349
She never recovered from the shock.

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:05.445
Marina... contracted German measles
during the pregnancy.

01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:08.527
And she never knew how.

01:39:08.651 --> 01:39:13.248
And then one afternoon, a perfect
stranger tells her with pleasure,

01:39:13.364 --> 01:39:16.709
with pride even, what she has done.

01:39:16.826 --> 01:39:21.377
And you let me kiss you.
Oh, yes, you did!

01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:25.923
What a nice little story, dear.

01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:31.466
- Now, can I get you a drink?
- Oh, thank you, yes.

01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:33.468
<i>[Marple] A rather perfect murder.</i>

01:39:33.593 --> 01:39:38.190
Not exactly as Cherry described it.
I was wrong about one thing.

01:39:38.306 --> 01:39:40.775
I deduced that one of the guests
at the party

01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:43.486
took the risk of putting
the poison in the glass.

01:39:43.603 --> 01:39:45.981
But it was unnecessary.
No one would have noticed

01:39:46.105 --> 01:39:50.201
<i>the hostess taking a momentary leave
of absence to visit her bathroom</i>

01:39:50.318 --> 01:39:51.695
<i>to prepare the fetal potion.</i>

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:53.913
<i>As an actress used to handling props,</i>

01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:57.034
<i>she would have had no trouble
jogging Heather's elbow,</i>

01:39:57.158 --> 01:40:01.379
<i>accidentally spilling her drink
and offering her her own.</i>

01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:05.171
<i>Marina had to insist that
she was the intended victim,</i>

01:40:05.291 --> 01:40:09.091
<i>that the murder was aimed at her
to support her plot.</i>

01:40:09.212 --> 01:40:11.510
<i>She wrote the notes herself</i>

01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:17.434
Even doctored her coffee at the studio.
It deceived nearly everybody. Nearly.

01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:19.726
But one person saw through it.

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:23.560
You knew, didn't you, Mr Rudd?

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:26.563
It was the notes
that made you finally realise.

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:30.191
The notes your wife forgot
to tell you about.

01:40:30.316 --> 01:40:34.071
If they had been real,
she would have informed you at once.

01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:35.822
So you decided to protect her.

01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:42.208
[Craddock] Mr Rudd,
I'd like to speak to your wife.

01:40:42.328 --> 01:40:45.582
[Miss Marple] Would you mind
if I saw her first?

01:40:45.706 --> 01:40:47.800
Thank you, dear. Mr Rudd.

01:41:09.564 --> 01:41:12.738
- Miss Marple.
- Yes, Mr Rudd?

01:41:14.694 --> 01:41:16.662
She's dead.

01:41:16.779 --> 01:41:21.125
I rather suspected as much.
Couldn't you?

01:41:21.242 --> 01:41:22.869
I killed her.

01:41:24.954 --> 01:41:28.504
I put poison in
her hot chocolate last night.

01:41:34.005 --> 01:41:36.679
It was inevitable
she would have been discovered.

01:41:39.093 --> 01:41:41.846
I couldn't let her face the humiliation.

01:41:44.557 --> 01:41:46.935
She's suffered enough.

01:41:47.977 --> 01:41:50.730
You must have loved her very much.

01:42:06.704 --> 01:42:10.834
Mr Rudd,
I think you better come in here.

01:42:28.768 --> 01:42:30.236
Marina?

01:42:35.775 --> 01:42:39.075
<i>[Marple]</i> Mr Rudd.

01:43:09.892 --> 01:43:12.771
She's given
the performance of her life.
