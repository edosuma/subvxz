00:34.744 --> 00:36.044
Gator.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.535
Any sign of the sub?

00:37.560 --> 00:39.461
The sonobuoys we placed
in the canal indicate

00:39.486 --> 00:41.274
they're patrolling in a
standard search pattern

00:41.299 --> 00:43.458
here to here.

00:43.483 --> 00:45.989
And with <i>Nathan James</i>
hiding out here in the pass?

00:46.481 --> 00:48.985
They're closing in on us,
sir... Little by little.

00:49.010 --> 00:50.608
How long before they pinpoint our location?

00:50.633 --> 00:53.740
It's hard to say, sir, but
it could be a matter of hours.

00:53.765 --> 00:56.070
Once we enter their kill
box, it's a shooting gallery.

00:56.095 --> 00:57.361
If we go deeper into the pass,

00:57.386 --> 00:58.719
it might buy us a little more time.

00:58.744 --> 01:00.210
No.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.094
We're not hiding any longer,

01:03.119 --> 01:05.681
and we're not waiting for
Ramsey to make the first move.

01:05.706 --> 01:08.243
If that sub's waiting for
us at the mouth of the river,

01:08.535 --> 01:11.603
we go around... Take her on from the flank.

01:11.628 --> 01:13.317
This ends today.

01:13.342 --> 01:15.017
Aye, sir.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.640

02:00.943 --> 02:03.545
So, this is where it all happens, huh?

02:05.525 --> 02:07.118
Always with the secrecy.

02:07.143 --> 02:09.180
You wonder why people don't trust you.

02:09.286 --> 02:12.954
I know why people don't trust us... You.

02:12.979 --> 02:15.780
And because of that, four
of my friends are dead.

02:15.805 --> 02:17.105
Well, Sean lied to me, too.

02:17.130 --> 02:19.110
Right. So, which is it?

02:19.135 --> 02:21.636
Are you with us or are you
gonna keep taking shots?

02:21.661 --> 02:23.694
Because we've got work to do.

02:23.719 --> 02:26.119
Can you reconnect to the
Valkyrie Network or not?

02:26.312 --> 02:28.512
You have an antenna lead?

02:39.292 --> 02:41.159
Then let's find out.

02:44.287 --> 02:48.131
So, this woman, Val, is trying
to link back into her network?

02:48.156 --> 02:49.355
As we speak.

02:49.380 --> 02:51.380
And you feel we can trust her?

02:51.405 --> 02:53.872
I think she's been won over.

02:53.897 --> 02:56.231
But we'll be observing everything she does.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.587
And we still have no sonar?

02:58.721 --> 02:59.938
No, sir.

02:59.963 --> 03:02.697
Our engineering team is trying
to rig up a depth finder,

03:02.722 --> 03:04.643
but once we go hot with
it, we'll be putting

03:04.668 --> 03:07.435
10 times more current through
it than it was designed for.

03:07.460 --> 03:08.982
So it may burn out?

03:09.443 --> 03:11.410
Could last an hour.

03:11.435 --> 03:13.181
More likely, minutes.

03:13.206 --> 03:14.906
And without it?

03:15.715 --> 03:19.617
No sonar, no way to see that sub.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.868
So you'll just have one shot at them?

03:23.400 --> 03:26.501
That's assuming it works at all.

03:27.253 --> 03:28.520
Well...

03:28.545 --> 03:30.412
Should be interesting.

03:34.307 --> 03:37.174
I can't have you here
when it all goes down...

03:37.199 --> 03:39.347
Not you, not Dr. Scott and her team,

03:39.372 --> 03:41.506
not ray and the kids, not the cure.

03:41.548 --> 03:43.214
Especially not the cure.

03:43.239 --> 03:45.806
You can't tell me it's
safer on land than here...

03:45.902 --> 03:47.769
Not with roving immune armies

03:47.794 --> 03:49.605
and non-immunes conned by Ramsey.

03:49.630 --> 03:53.904
Mr. President, as of today,
this ship has gone from being

03:53.929 --> 03:55.535
one of the safest places on earth

03:55.560 --> 03:57.460
to one of the most dangerous.

03:57.485 --> 03:58.692
You'll disembark with a team

03:58.717 --> 04:01.940
of our most experienced
operators, led by the X.O.,

04:01.965 --> 04:04.161
along with the other assets
we can't afford to lose.

04:04.186 --> 04:05.652
I understand about the cure,

04:05.677 --> 04:07.746
about Dr. Scott, and about the children,

04:07.881 --> 04:09.280
but I'm the commander in chief...

04:09.305 --> 04:13.308
Which is why you need to
be protected at all costs.

04:13.310 --> 04:14.675
You saw what happened

04:14.700 --> 04:16.711
the last time we faced these guys.

04:16.736 --> 04:18.903
There's no real choice here, sir.

04:25.816 --> 04:27.016
Hey!

04:27.041 --> 04:28.984
Hey, you see anything over there?

04:29.008 --> 04:30.320
No. You?

04:30.345 --> 04:31.902
Just a matter of time.

04:31.927 --> 04:32.992
Head east.

04:33.017 --> 04:35.517
Navy ship can't hide long in these waters.

04:39.953 --> 04:41.820
We've picked up radio chatter

04:41.822 --> 04:43.889
from over a dozen boats in the area.

04:43.891 --> 04:46.091
American civilians are closing in

04:46.116 --> 04:49.538
at the mouths of all the canals
between us and the open sea...

04:49.763 --> 04:52.264
Here, here, here, and here.

04:52.266 --> 04:53.398
We're completely surrounded.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.900
They're forming a blockade...

04:54.925 --> 04:56.958
Trying to force us toward the sub.

04:58.504 --> 04:59.838
How do you know where they are?

04:59.840 --> 05:01.640
I accessed the Deadman Network

05:01.642 --> 05:03.909
and plotted the position of all the phones.

05:03.911 --> 05:06.028
I thought only the immunes
had the deadman game.

05:06.053 --> 05:07.052
They do.

05:07.077 --> 05:08.265
Sir, it looks like

05:08.290 --> 05:10.616
the immunes and the civilians
are working side by side.

05:10.747 --> 05:13.080
Sean Ramsey ordered the blockade directly.

05:13.153 --> 05:14.395
Can't you shut down the network,

05:14.420 --> 05:15.887
keep them from communicating altogether?

05:15.990 --> 05:18.247
I built the network so it
can't be killed that way.

05:18.272 --> 05:21.606
You'd have to physically
disable each relay station.

05:21.631 --> 05:22.631
Clever.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.900
I thought so.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.391
At the time.

05:26.416 --> 05:29.484
Well, we can't just sit
here trapped on the canal.

05:29.509 --> 05:32.548
Give me three operators,
a couple RPGs, and a RHIB.

05:32.573 --> 05:33.942
We'll take out the blockade ourselves.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.700
We're not firing on American civilians...

05:35.725 --> 05:37.625
Under any circumstances.

05:37.875 --> 05:41.790
With all due respect, sir,
those civilians fired on us...

05:41.815 --> 05:42.760
Drew first blood.

05:42.789 --> 05:44.989
Lieutenant, the president's right.

05:44.991 --> 05:47.368
Even if we use our non-lethals,

05:47.393 --> 05:49.513
the instant those civilian boats see us,

05:49.538 --> 05:51.671
they'll give our position to the sub.

05:54.332 --> 05:55.851
Then we head right into the ambush...

05:55.876 --> 05:57.851
Take our chances in a dogfight.

05:57.884 --> 05:58.789
No.

05:58.814 --> 06:00.015
There's another way.

06:00.339 --> 06:02.273
I can't kill my network,

06:02.275 --> 06:04.975
but I can flood it with disinformation.

06:05.911 --> 06:09.046
Spoof messages saying
we're somewhere else...

06:09.048 --> 06:11.248
Send the civilians on a wild goose chase.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.516
And away from us.

06:12.518 --> 06:14.510
Till someone shows up on a jet ski,

06:14.535 --> 06:16.774
sees there's only open ocean
where we're supposed to be.

06:16.799 --> 06:17.955
Oh, I can take care of that...

06:17.957 --> 06:19.991
Bounce messages off multiple repeaters

06:19.993 --> 06:22.693
so the boats think you're on the move.

06:22.695 --> 06:26.731
Then everywhere they show up,
it'll look like you just left.

06:26.756 --> 06:29.056
And if the sub bought it...

06:29.502 --> 06:31.135
They'd head North, too.

06:31.137 --> 06:34.739
We could send Ramsey racing
to a location of our choosing

06:34.764 --> 06:36.463
and cut him off.

06:36.488 --> 06:38.555
That would be your one shot.

06:47.285 --> 06:50.515
Whew. I can almost smell the jambalaya.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.740
You know, I grew up just
20 miles North of here.

06:52.765 --> 06:54.231
I remember.

06:54.256 --> 06:56.362
What? You figure you're
getting a homecoming dinner?

06:56.387 --> 06:58.062
What do you mean?

06:58.064 --> 06:59.395
You got eyes, don't you?

06:59.420 --> 07:01.643
Even if we beat that sub,

07:01.668 --> 07:04.935
I don't recognize this country anymore.

07:05.673 --> 07:07.741
Well, I guess we'll just
have to work a little harder

07:07.766 --> 07:09.132
to get it back.

07:09.157 --> 07:10.924
Know what I'm saying?

07:23.609 --> 07:25.453
You all right, Radish?

07:25.478 --> 07:27.635
Just lost a bunch of my friends.

07:27.660 --> 07:29.938
Maybe gonna lose the rest of them now.

07:30.185 --> 07:32.919
Ravit was the closest
thing I had left to family.

07:32.944 --> 07:34.344
But we march on, mate.

07:34.369 --> 07:36.335
It's all we can do.

07:37.703 --> 07:39.054
Do you need help with this, sir?

07:39.079 --> 07:40.111
Thank you.

07:40.136 --> 07:41.436
What's your name, son?

07:41.461 --> 07:42.360
Ray Diaz.

07:42.385 --> 07:44.052
Future secret service man.

07:45.755 --> 07:47.207
Hey, Doc.

07:49.249 --> 07:51.016
Just in case.

07:53.922 --> 07:56.890
Clips to your belt. Wraps
around your upper thigh.

07:57.493 --> 07:59.327
I'll let you put it on.

08:13.972 --> 08:15.473
Lieutenant.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.220
Lieutenant.

08:19.245 --> 08:21.045
You doing okay?

08:21.047 --> 08:23.948
Good as I can be.

08:27.786 --> 08:30.343
Stay safe out there, okay?

08:30.368 --> 08:32.443
You too.

08:37.321 --> 08:38.721
Kara.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.582
This sub...

08:44.607 --> 08:47.174
You've beaten them before.

08:47.340 --> 08:49.740
You'll sink it this time.

08:56.693 --> 09:00.930
Don't you dare make me
raise this child by myself.

09:00.955 --> 09:03.097
That will not happen.

09:03.122 --> 09:05.222
Okay?

09:20.482 --> 09:23.076
I'll see you soon.

09:23.773 --> 09:25.407
Okay.

09:35.497 --> 09:37.532
Figures the one time you
don't go with the land team,

09:37.557 --> 09:39.523
all the action's gonna be on the ship.

09:39.525 --> 09:41.158
The cure's the thing.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.247
Whatever happens,

09:42.272 --> 09:44.373
I know you'll get it where it needs to go.

09:44.509 --> 09:46.275
It's coming right back here.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.133
I'm glad you're so confident.

09:48.167 --> 09:49.567
Well, it sucks, though.

09:49.569 --> 09:51.335
I really wanted to be there

09:51.337 --> 09:53.637
when you sank that son of a bitch.

10:00.145 --> 10:02.732
For my family.

10:05.340 --> 10:06.986
Understood.

10:10.119 --> 10:11.920
Commander.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.444
Commander.

10:14.921 --> 10:16.989
Land teams, let's load up the RHIBs.

10:17.014 --> 10:19.147
Move out!

10:59.066 --> 11:01.401
Burk, Miller, you're on POTUS.

11:01.403 --> 11:03.750
Walkies are off. All
comms are face-to-face.

11:03.775 --> 11:05.882
We do not, under any circumstances,

11:05.907 --> 11:07.316
make contact with the ship.

11:07.535 --> 11:09.168
We are officially dark

11:09.193 --> 11:13.016
till we hear from them that
they've killed that sub.

11:21.021 --> 11:24.691
We'll be putting juice
down all 50 leads now.

11:24.693 --> 11:26.815
It's gonna light up like a flashbulb.

11:29.069 --> 11:30.430
How's it coming?

11:30.432 --> 11:31.964
About halfway through, ma'am.

11:31.966 --> 11:33.700
Thanks for your help, Master Chief.

11:33.702 --> 11:35.968
Kind of shorthanded down here.

11:35.970 --> 11:37.336
Brilliant idea, ma'am...

11:37.338 --> 11:40.039
Turning the depth finder
into a sub-hunting sonar.

11:40.064 --> 11:42.825
Yeah, well, it's only
brilliant if it works.

11:43.511 --> 11:45.578
We're betting that the sub is roughly here.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.903
We're gonna spoof that we're
at the mouth of Quarantine Bay.

11:47.928 --> 11:50.351
That should draw the civilians
out of the waterways north.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.977
If the sub takes the bait,
they'll head along this route.

11:53.002 --> 11:54.601
That's where they'll get the most depth.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.719
- And stealth.
- Yes, sir.

11:56.744 --> 11:59.511
Assuming the civilians clear
the blockade and head upriver,

11:59.536 --> 12:01.438
we'll make the turn out of pass a loutre

12:01.463 --> 12:03.396
and head northeast up
through the Main Pass.

12:03.398 --> 12:06.143
And if all goes as planned,
we'll make contact right here.

12:06.168 --> 12:08.802
Hit them while they're
looking the other way.

12:08.827 --> 12:10.613
We'll need to be completely silent

12:10.638 --> 12:13.072
when we reach the opening, or
the sub will hear us coming.

12:13.074 --> 12:14.474
So we build up a good head of steam,

12:14.476 --> 12:16.242
kill the engines, and
coast into open water,

12:16.244 --> 12:18.544
light up that sonar, and
fire at whatever's there.

12:18.546 --> 12:20.546
Once sonar's up, we can fix target and fire

12:20.548 --> 12:21.714
in less than 10 seconds, sir.

12:21.716 --> 12:22.949
Very well.

12:23.753 --> 12:25.154
Sir, we have a remote connect with CESS

12:25.179 --> 12:26.678
so Val can work from here.

12:26.721 --> 12:27.892
This goes wrong, a lot of people

12:27.917 --> 12:29.717
are gonna get caught in the crossfire.

12:29.742 --> 12:30.974
It'll work.

12:33.227 --> 12:34.994
Time to flood the network, then.

12:34.996 --> 12:36.496
Let Ramsey's armada know

12:36.498 --> 12:39.699
<i>Nathan James</i> has
been spotted and on the move.

12:39.724 --> 12:41.724
Start now.

12:54.016 --> 12:55.483
Relax.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.308
I'm not a double agent.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.638
I'm on the ship, too.

12:58.663 --> 13:00.763
I'm not worried.

13:00.788 --> 13:03.388
First sign you're not on our side,

13:03.413 --> 13:04.749
I'll kill you myself.

13:18.937 --> 13:22.858
Sir, incoming messages indicate
civilians are responding.

13:22.883 --> 13:25.584
They're on the move. Looks
like they're buying it.

13:25.609 --> 13:27.376
On the move and headed North.

13:27.401 --> 13:29.934
Just make sure you don't
put us too far east.

13:29.959 --> 13:32.817
We need that sub to cross the
mouth of the northern pass.

13:32.842 --> 13:35.676
O.O.D., get the ship under way.

13:36.195 --> 13:37.828
Let's move.

13:37.853 --> 13:39.794
Aye, sir.

13:45.188 --> 13:47.413
Hell of a day to sink a ship, is it not?

13:47.439 --> 13:49.306
Right. Yeah!

13:49.331 --> 13:50.597
Any news?

13:50.622 --> 13:51.921
Not yet.

13:52.073 --> 13:53.506
The plan's closing in on him, though.

13:53.508 --> 13:56.623
Civilians got all the
escape routes blockaded now.

13:56.648 --> 13:58.711
They'll flush them right out
to us, and then it's over.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.780
Multiple sightings of the destroyer, sir.

14:00.782 --> 14:02.347
Speak of the devil. Where?

14:02.372 --> 14:05.518
Says here Quarantine Bay.

14:11.098 --> 14:13.799
You slippery bastard.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.741
Must have flown the Coop
before the blockade formed.

14:18.766 --> 14:20.676
Well, so much for your American armada.

14:20.701 --> 14:23.168
They let a 500-foot
ship get right past them.

14:23.170 --> 14:24.317
Fret not, Bruv.

14:24.342 --> 14:26.590
I've got a contingency on
land for this very reason.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.449
Have Ian ready the rocket battery.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.012
We're gonna give him something to shoot at.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.569
Right, Guv.

14:31.811 --> 14:33.244
We got them.

14:34.813 --> 14:37.648
Don't lose faith in me now.

14:41.327 --> 14:45.429
Set a new course - come 295,
Quarantine Bay.

14:45.454 --> 14:46.906
All ahead full.

14:46.931 --> 14:50.299
Aye, sir. Setting new course, 295.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.234
Around the next bend is where we estimated

15:04.259 --> 15:06.525
the American blockade to be, sir.

15:06.652 --> 15:08.786
You sure they're all gone.

15:08.811 --> 15:10.393
Should be.

15:10.418 --> 15:13.352
Everyone with a phone, at least.

15:22.141 --> 15:23.575
C.I.C., bridge.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.722
Bring all non-lethal
countermeasures online.

15:25.747 --> 15:28.014
If there are American
boats around this bend,

15:28.039 --> 15:29.439
we do not shoot to kill.

15:29.464 --> 15:30.263
T.A.O., aye.

15:30.288 --> 15:32.421
Combat, ready LAWS and LRAD.

15:35.884 --> 15:37.685
Here we go, sir.

16:06.512 --> 16:08.180
First time in my life,

16:08.205 --> 16:11.250
I'm hoping not to see any Americans.

16:33.954 --> 16:36.454
It worked.

16:36.479 --> 16:38.112
Good job.

16:38.718 --> 16:40.119
Now keep it going.

16:58.449 --> 16:59.982
This is it.

17:00.007 --> 17:02.836
Taylor, Miller, Cruz, set security.

17:07.703 --> 17:10.104
Ray, I think it's time
you got your people fed.

17:10.128 --> 17:12.626
Remember, rations might
have to last us the week.

17:12.651 --> 17:14.117
All right, guys, chow time.

17:14.142 --> 17:16.152
Two granola bars each
and half a liter of water.

17:16.176 --> 17:19.145
Next meal's at 1900.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.887
Next mark... Southeast corner of Black Bay.

17:24.998 --> 17:26.196
Got it.

17:27.704 --> 17:30.372
We're keeping the American
armada on the move, sir.

17:30.397 --> 17:33.198
If the sub has joined the
hunt, I estimate they're here,

17:33.223 --> 17:34.756
heading right for our ambush.

17:34.781 --> 17:36.369
How long till we're out of the canal?

17:36.394 --> 17:37.447
10 minutes, sir.

17:37.472 --> 17:38.866
Perfect.

17:42.213 --> 17:43.580
CCS, bridge.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.371
Stand by to go hot with the sonar.

17:45.396 --> 17:46.499
I want to test her out.

17:46.524 --> 17:47.818
Copy that, sir.

17:51.615 --> 17:53.193
Go ahead, Eng.

17:53.789 --> 17:56.811
Sending juice to the sonar head.

18:06.746 --> 18:09.356
Ma'am, you can cook a steak on this thing.

18:09.659 --> 18:11.890
It's gonna get even
hotter once we go active.

18:11.915 --> 18:13.384
Ma'am, can you call the Galley

18:13.409 --> 18:15.302
and have them start sending buckets of ice?

18:15.327 --> 18:18.602
I'll organize a team.

18:19.353 --> 18:20.887
Whew.

18:40.621 --> 18:43.630
Hardest thing about goodbye is...

18:44.481 --> 18:47.829
All the things you didn't say.

18:48.527 --> 18:52.963
All the... Unresolved stuff...

18:53.434 --> 18:57.103
Your feelings, whatnot.

18:59.188 --> 19:01.523
You and the captain...

19:03.352 --> 19:06.454
You'll get a chance to
say what you need to.

19:10.509 --> 19:12.343
The hell is that?

19:20.509 --> 19:22.541
That child is sick.

19:22.566 --> 19:24.111
Shh. Stay put.

19:24.136 --> 19:25.127
You want me to stay put

19:25.152 --> 19:26.830
when you know very well
that I can heal her?

19:26.856 --> 19:29.260
Until this battle is over,
we don't exist out here.

19:29.285 --> 19:31.151
Once the captain gives the all-clear,

19:31.176 --> 19:32.583
we can go after them if you want.

19:32.608 --> 19:35.114
By which stage, she'll be dead.

19:37.495 --> 19:38.596
Excuse me.

19:38.621 --> 19:40.076
- Damn it!
- Wait! Dr. Scott!

19:43.143 --> 19:45.743
E-excuse me. The girl is sick.

19:46.706 --> 19:47.705
Hold it!

19:47.730 --> 19:49.500
Whoa! Whoa!

19:50.674 --> 19:51.608
Listen to me.

19:51.633 --> 19:53.332
Not another step, or I'll shoot!

19:53.357 --> 19:55.291
The girl is sick.

19:55.316 --> 19:56.699
You all are.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.479
- We have the cure.
- Got him.

19:58.495 --> 19:59.627
Hold your fire, Burk.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.067
I can help you.

20:02.092 --> 20:03.657
Don't lie to me! I know what you are!

20:03.682 --> 20:05.055
I'm not lying to you.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.068
- I got the shot. I can take him.
- Hold your fire.

20:07.070 --> 20:09.771
Y'all stay back! We don't want no trouble!

20:11.141 --> 20:13.678
Easy, cowboy.

20:14.352 --> 20:16.920
I'm gonna treat the child.

20:19.081 --> 20:21.349
If you want to stop me,

20:21.561 --> 20:24.462
you're gonna have to shoot me.

20:25.411 --> 20:27.065
All right?

20:27.090 --> 20:29.123
Stay back.

20:30.974 --> 20:32.442
Mase.

20:32.467 --> 20:35.000
Stay back!

20:38.051 --> 20:40.018
Lower it, Mase!

20:40.738 --> 20:42.906
It's all right.

20:55.146 --> 20:57.248
It's all right.

21:18.246 --> 21:20.326
Give me your hands.

21:49.505 --> 21:52.406
You said you could cure my daughter.

21:57.943 --> 22:00.812
I already have.

22:08.289 --> 22:11.325
I already have.

22:16.775 --> 22:20.319
Sorry we came at you like that.
We thought you was immunes.

22:20.344 --> 22:22.110
We was sure of it, the way you came at us.

22:22.112 --> 22:23.779
No one was wearing any masks.

22:23.781 --> 22:26.048
They was the ones gave us the sickness...

22:26.050 --> 22:27.516
At one of they camps.

22:27.518 --> 22:31.253
Wrapped my daughter up in
one of they infected blankets.

22:31.255 --> 22:32.955
Couple days later...

22:32.957 --> 22:35.691
First sign of the fever,
they kicked us out.

22:35.693 --> 22:36.905
We found a car,

22:36.930 --> 22:39.365
but it died on the road
a few miles North of here.

22:39.539 --> 22:40.907
Where were you headed?

22:41.065 --> 22:42.482
Back home.

22:42.507 --> 22:44.641
To do what?

22:47.326 --> 22:49.260
To be together.

22:53.009 --> 22:55.244
You're not gonna die.

22:56.512 --> 22:59.646
The cure is contagious as the common cold.

23:02.235 --> 23:04.036
You sure you don't want
to give them the shot?

23:04.061 --> 23:05.954
You never tried this on a human before.

23:05.956 --> 23:08.180
It's gonna work, Tex.

23:08.669 --> 23:10.102
All right.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.627
Lieutenant Green,

23:11.629 --> 23:13.762
bring these people some
M.R.E.S and water, please.

23:13.764 --> 23:15.230
Yes, sir.

23:16.574 --> 23:18.166
Y'all with the Navy, then.

23:18.168 --> 23:20.202
Yes, ma'am.

23:21.011 --> 23:22.676
We should tell them.

23:23.273 --> 23:24.573
Tell us what?

23:24.575 --> 23:26.985
When we were there at the immune camp,

23:27.010 --> 23:29.044
yesterday morning, right before we left,

23:29.046 --> 23:30.879
we heard some people talking.

23:30.881 --> 23:33.481
They said some English ones from the sub

23:33.483 --> 23:35.816
was bringing something to Lomas Point...

23:35.953 --> 23:37.619
Something to sink your ship.

23:37.621 --> 23:39.321
What do you mean, "something"?

23:39.323 --> 23:42.695
I got the idea it was
some kind of gun or tank...

23:42.720 --> 23:43.752
Serious artillery.

23:44.049 --> 23:45.682
They just said it was something big

23:45.707 --> 23:47.507
and it could take you out.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.134
If it's a threat, we better warn them.

23:53.136 --> 23:55.303
Yeah, if we warn them, it could
give up both our positions.

23:55.305 --> 23:57.138
Well, then, we got to
go after them ourselves.

23:57.140 --> 23:59.541
Lomas Point's just a
few miles north of here.

23:59.543 --> 24:00.861
Mr. president?

24:00.886 --> 24:02.686
Do what you got to do.

24:03.646 --> 24:05.780
We'll be fine here.

24:06.664 --> 24:08.031
Tex, Green, gear up.

24:08.056 --> 24:10.304
We take one RHIB. Everyone else stays put.

24:14.795 --> 24:17.530
Burk, it's on you now here.

24:17.817 --> 24:21.291
Don't worry, X.O. I got it.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.705
Lots of sightings, sir.

24:41.855 --> 24:44.813
Ship's on the move again...
Heading north-northwest.

24:44.838 --> 24:46.571
It's all the way up to Black Bay.

24:46.596 --> 24:48.863
He's moving fast.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.789
Too fast for someone trying
to tiptoe around a sub.

24:55.314 --> 24:57.182
Bloody hell.

24:57.207 --> 24:58.840
Val.

25:02.039 --> 25:04.807
Stand by to go hot with the sonar.

25:10.421 --> 25:13.825
All engines stop. E-stop all main engines.

25:13.850 --> 25:15.950
CCS, bridge, e-stop all main engines.

25:15.952 --> 25:17.986
- All stop, aye.
- Feather props.

25:17.988 --> 25:19.721
We're drifting into the fight zone.

25:19.723 --> 25:21.489
Keep an eye on our speed as we decelerate.

25:21.491 --> 25:23.341
If we start to lose
steerage, I want to know.

25:23.366 --> 25:24.899
Aye, sir.

25:36.317 --> 25:37.551
CCS, captain.

25:37.576 --> 25:39.146
On my call, fire it up.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.470
Aye, sir.

25:42.552 --> 25:46.254
C.I.C., prepare to calculate
a fire-control solution.

25:46.451 --> 25:48.631
T.A.O., aye.

25:53.095 --> 25:54.095
Now.

26:03.152 --> 26:04.319
Where are they?

26:06.102 --> 26:07.688
Shut it down.

26:13.108 --> 26:14.108
What the hell?

26:14.133 --> 26:15.365
What?

26:15.390 --> 26:17.057
I could swear I just heard something.

26:17.082 --> 26:18.256
We got pinged?

26:18.281 --> 26:20.815
No, it was an echo off the sea bottom.

26:21.195 --> 26:23.163
But it's gone now.

26:23.188 --> 26:25.030
Go active sonar?

26:25.055 --> 26:26.688
No. Not yet.

26:39.995 --> 26:41.662
How much speed left?

26:41.687 --> 26:42.881
6 knots, sir.

26:42.906 --> 26:44.505
We lose steering at 3 1/2,

26:44.507 --> 26:46.588
approximately 90 seconds from now.

26:46.962 --> 26:49.396
I can't spoof you any deeper into the bay.

26:49.421 --> 26:52.221
It'll look like you're on land.

26:56.652 --> 26:57.985
T.A.O.

26:57.987 --> 27:00.437
Roll F.I.S. Green. Ready torpedoes.

27:00.462 --> 27:01.462
T.A.O., aye.

27:02.510 --> 27:03.568
F.I.S. is green.

27:03.593 --> 27:04.828
On my mark.

27:04.853 --> 27:05.727
Target, sir?

27:05.729 --> 27:07.228
I'm working on it.

27:16.688 --> 27:18.255
Speed?

27:18.280 --> 27:20.080
4 1/2.

27:29.270 --> 27:31.574
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

27:31.772 --> 27:34.006
He's close.

27:40.545 --> 27:43.080
Helmsman...

27:43.105 --> 27:45.205
Come right.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.635
Steer course 0-9-5.

27:47.910 --> 27:49.476
Aye, sir.

28:07.915 --> 28:09.316
Sonar.

28:09.341 --> 28:10.658
You got one more in you?

28:10.683 --> 28:12.683
Ready as we'll ever be, sir.

28:12.708 --> 28:14.842
Fire it up on my call.

28:20.769 --> 28:23.070
Spin the prop a moment.

28:23.095 --> 28:26.630
Full slow, rudder a touch to port.

28:26.655 --> 28:28.321
Aye, sir.

28:31.702 --> 28:33.269
Light it up.

28:36.343 --> 28:38.109
Keep 'em coming!

28:43.892 --> 28:46.061
Contact! They're here!

28:48.392 --> 28:49.858
Son of a...

28:49.883 --> 28:51.816
Where?

28:58.168 --> 29:01.214
He's right below us.

29:09.628 --> 29:12.172
We can't fire with them right below us.

29:12.197 --> 29:14.464
Come to full power! All
engines ahead, flank three!

29:14.466 --> 29:16.440
All engines ahead, flank three, aye!

29:20.362 --> 29:21.762
We need room.

29:21.787 --> 29:23.749
Engines, all ahead full.

29:23.774 --> 29:25.006
Aye, sir!

29:26.053 --> 29:27.379
They're accelerating.

29:27.404 --> 29:28.478
Right 20-degree rudder.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.846
Stay on him!

29:29.848 --> 29:32.820
C.I.C., prepare to fire. Yes, sir.

29:34.018 --> 29:35.195
Is he turning?

29:35.220 --> 29:36.386
Stay under him.

29:36.388 --> 29:39.103
As soon as the bottom drops off,
we dive and fire on my order.

29:39.128 --> 29:40.127
Aye!

29:40.152 --> 29:41.390
Stay on them!

29:41.392 --> 29:42.433
How fast are they moving?

29:42.458 --> 29:43.937
Approaching 30 knots, sir.

29:43.962 --> 29:45.795
He's going too fast.

29:45.953 --> 29:49.222
CCS, disengage rev limiters.
Override engine safeties.

29:49.389 --> 29:51.255
Come on. Kick it into overdrive.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.947
I got a surprise for you.

29:54.119 --> 29:56.520
Come on! We need more ice!

29:57.600 --> 29:59.776
Come on, baby! Stay with me!

29:59.801 --> 30:01.134
Fire torpedoes, sir?

30:01.159 --> 30:03.690
Too close. They're almost right above us.

30:03.715 --> 30:05.066
I'm ready to fire right now, sir.

30:05.091 --> 30:06.759
We'll blow ourselves bloody up!

30:06.784 --> 30:08.973
We can stay under him
until we reach deep water.

30:08.998 --> 30:11.317
We're coming up on deep
water! He's gonna dive!

30:11.342 --> 30:12.775
How long before we can dive?

30:12.800 --> 30:14.400
Two klicks to the trench, sir.

30:14.425 --> 30:16.125
They have to know we're
running for the deep.

30:16.127 --> 30:17.842
They're gonna make a move any second.

30:19.563 --> 30:22.726
On my mark, all back full!

30:22.751 --> 30:23.905
Arm torpedoes.

30:23.930 --> 30:24.958
Aye, sir!

30:24.959 --> 30:26.836
Call it out when we can dive. Yes, sir!

30:26.861 --> 30:27.960
Engage emergency power.

30:28.063 --> 30:29.529
Engaging!

30:34.101 --> 30:35.634
500 meters from the shelf!

30:35.636 --> 30:36.969
- Prepare to fire.
- Aye, sir.

30:36.971 --> 30:39.071
Fire while diving. Release at 100 meters.

30:39.073 --> 30:40.706
Prepare to dive!

30:40.708 --> 30:41.743
Come on! More ice!

30:43.259 --> 30:45.219
This thing's going!

30:47.106 --> 30:48.540
No sonar!

30:48.565 --> 30:51.132
Dive now! Dive! Dive! Dive!

30:53.955 --> 30:55.001
We're at the drop-off, sir!

30:55.026 --> 30:57.221
All engines back full!

30:58.871 --> 31:00.638
Unh!

31:03.642 --> 31:05.243
Fire torpedoes!

31:05.268 --> 31:08.138
Four downrange now!

31:15.950 --> 31:17.686
Man your station.

31:20.398 --> 31:22.600
85 meters!

31:22.625 --> 31:24.234
90! 95!

31:24.259 --> 31:25.458
Call it!

31:25.483 --> 31:27.437
Fire torpedoes!

31:30.570 --> 31:32.871
Hydrophone effects! We've got incoming!

31:32.896 --> 31:34.329
I count three!

31:34.354 --> 31:35.420
Now four!

31:35.445 --> 31:36.377
Emergency dive!

31:36.397 --> 31:38.998
Full ahead! Point her down!

31:42.301 --> 31:45.069
T.A.O., what's the status of our torpedoes?

31:45.094 --> 31:47.127
Captain, we're blind here. Sonar's out.

31:47.152 --> 31:48.819
He's probably launched on us.

31:48.844 --> 31:50.322
Hard right rudder!

31:53.938 --> 31:56.239
Activate prairie/masker air.

31:56.264 --> 31:58.238
Launch acoustic decoys.

32:02.975 --> 32:05.592
Shit!

32:12.993 --> 32:16.329
I need eyes out there.
Did we hit them or not?

32:17.580 --> 32:20.305
Torpedo trails, portside, 0-1-0!

32:20.330 --> 32:21.486
All hands, brace for shock!

32:21.511 --> 32:22.877
Holy shit!

32:24.464 --> 32:25.965
We're hit!

32:25.990 --> 32:29.258
D.C. central, dispatch
teams to portside midships.

32:29.283 --> 32:32.263
Fire on deck 4, portside amidships!

32:32.288 --> 32:35.022
Fire in the magazine! Fire in the magazine!

32:35.047 --> 32:36.599
Captain, fire in the weapons room!

32:36.624 --> 32:38.868
Flood it! Flood projectiles magazine!

32:38.893 --> 32:41.331
Port shaft is down! No
turns on portside shaft!

32:41.356 --> 32:44.357
Enable shaft seal. Head 2-9-0.
Maintain evasive action.

32:44.382 --> 32:45.331
Seal compartments,

32:45.356 --> 32:47.910
frames 7-2 through 1-2-4,
decks 4, 5, and 6.

32:47.935 --> 32:49.105
Set primary boundaries...

32:49.130 --> 32:51.499
Frames 7-2 through 1-2-4,
decks 4, 5, and 6.

33:02.362 --> 33:05.394
Commander! O'Connor!

33:05.419 --> 33:06.425
Come on!

33:06.450 --> 33:08.684
Ship's flooding! They're
gonna seal us in here!

33:08.709 --> 33:10.466
Ma'am, come on!

33:12.794 --> 33:15.693
Come on. This way.

33:23.143 --> 33:24.658
T.A.O. Status.

33:24.683 --> 33:26.305
Did we hit that sub or not?

33:26.307 --> 33:27.873
We cannot confirm, sir.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.341
Magazine's flooded, sir.

33:29.343 --> 33:31.277
We're out of weapons.

33:40.540 --> 33:43.196
Yeah. She's getting better.

33:45.679 --> 33:47.747
What are you doing, Doc?

33:47.748 --> 33:50.934
Documenting history.

33:51.253 --> 33:53.653
A contagious cure.

34:06.509 --> 34:08.688
Any word?

34:08.713 --> 34:10.213
Nothing.

34:11.447 --> 34:13.447
T.A.O., what's left in the holster?

34:13.473 --> 34:14.917
Just the rounds in the 5-inch, sir.

34:14.942 --> 34:16.175
How many?

34:17.500 --> 34:19.429
Four.

34:22.614 --> 34:25.216
If all we got are surface weapons,

34:25.217 --> 34:28.052
we'll make this a surface fight.

34:28.054 --> 34:30.487
Head 2-9-5. Go for shallow water.

34:30.489 --> 34:33.529
We'll make that sub show its ugly face.

34:37.864 --> 34:40.297
Switching to emergency generators!

34:40.300 --> 34:42.900
Pressure hull's buckled,
sir! We got to surface!

34:42.902 --> 34:44.335
Shut your mouth!

34:44.338 --> 34:45.971
Turn for target!

34:45.973 --> 34:48.940
Back at them?! Are you completely mad?!

34:48.942 --> 34:51.409
He said, "turn to target," mate! Do it!

34:51.411 --> 34:53.779
Drive them to the rocket battery!

34:53.781 --> 34:56.313
Get us to periscope depth!

35:03.856 --> 35:06.425
Guys, have a look.

35:08.094 --> 35:10.328
That's a truck hauling something heavy.

35:10.330 --> 35:12.330
Yeah.

35:12.417 --> 35:14.198
On me.

35:25.800 --> 35:29.158
Ooh. That is some piece of hardware.

35:29.183 --> 35:31.229
That's a ship killer, all right.

35:31.254 --> 35:34.086
One of those warheads hits
the <i>James,</i> she's sunk.

35:34.088 --> 35:36.688
Looks like the same guys
we fought on <i>Solace.</i>

35:36.690 --> 35:38.156
I count seven.

35:38.181 --> 35:40.890
Well, let's see if we
can take that bad boy out.

35:41.283 --> 35:42.900
X.O.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.802
Oh, Tommy. What'd you go and do?

35:51.827 --> 35:54.481
Sir, approaching shoal water fast.

35:54.506 --> 35:55.440
How deep?

35:55.442 --> 35:58.582
35 feet below the keel.
Seabed's rock here, sir.

35:58.607 --> 36:00.512
If we touch at this speed, we're
gonna take the bottom out of the ship.

36:00.514 --> 36:02.620
Not much longer.

36:02.645 --> 36:05.746
It's too late to warn the ship.
They're already in firing range.

36:06.185 --> 36:08.854
Okay. Here's the plan, boys.

36:08.856 --> 36:10.522
Win.

36:10.524 --> 36:11.790
Good plan.

36:18.064 --> 36:22.067
Not long, guys. This is
what we've been waiting for.

36:22.069 --> 36:24.149
I'll draw their fire.

37:06.412 --> 37:08.346
Cover me!

37:32.878 --> 37:35.316
Dead to rights at 2-9-0!

37:35.341 --> 37:36.507
All full ahead.

37:36.509 --> 37:37.508
Aye, sir.

37:37.510 --> 37:39.037
- Arm torpedoes.
- Aye, sir.

37:39.062 --> 37:42.757
Submarine on our 6:00,
200 meters, bearing 2-9-5.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.248
They're accelerating!

37:51.446 --> 37:54.181
400 meters, sir! Locked on target!

37:54.206 --> 37:56.214
Prepare to fire!

37:56.576 --> 37:59.278
Submarine 300 meters,
coming straight at us, sir!

37:59.303 --> 38:02.214
Buttonhook starboard!

38:05.748 --> 38:08.750
Aren't you a little old for this? Eh?

38:08.775 --> 38:09.844
Aaaah!

38:09.869 --> 38:12.650
Come on!

38:19.707 --> 38:21.271
Aaaaah!

38:21.296 --> 38:23.945
Unggggggh!

38:29.546 --> 38:33.148
T.A.O., fire control will
fire as 5-inch bears on target

38:33.173 --> 38:34.458
- on your call.
- Aye, sir.

38:34.483 --> 38:37.229
Once that sub clears our
superstructure, we fire.

38:38.754 --> 38:42.016
Solved! On your order, sir!

38:42.041 --> 38:44.242
Sub's locked on us! They're going to fire!

38:44.244 --> 38:45.884
Sir, we still don't have a shot.

38:45.909 --> 38:48.396
Maintain heading!

38:48.421 --> 38:49.896
And...

38:59.424 --> 39:01.459
Cheers, asshole.

39:01.484 --> 39:03.537
T.A.O., let's finish the job.

39:03.562 --> 39:04.961
Fire four at will.

39:04.986 --> 39:06.486
Abandon ship!

39:06.511 --> 39:08.944
Get back! Get back to your posts!

39:09.068 --> 39:12.303
Get back to your posts! That's an order!

39:12.305 --> 39:13.879
We're chosen!

39:45.546 --> 39:47.714
We did it, sir.

39:47.739 --> 39:50.325
We did it.

40:06.556 --> 40:09.577
That is a damn fine sight.

40:09.753 --> 40:12.320
Amen.

40:12.799 --> 40:14.765
Vulture Team...

40:14.767 --> 40:16.667
The sub is sinking.

40:16.669 --> 40:17.735
Saddle up.

40:17.737 --> 40:19.537
We're headed home.

40:20.539 --> 40:21.873
It's over.

40:23.113 --> 40:24.914
It's over.

40:24.939 --> 40:26.639
Come here.

40:31.548 --> 40:33.616
Thank you.

40:36.444 --> 40:38.479
It worked.

40:38.629 --> 40:42.431
Your cure... It's a miracle.
