- Girl, you must be crazy.
- Steve, listen to your mom.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.967
- Bad news, Roger. The beach is closed.
- What?

11:17.076 --> 11:20.068
Yeah. Apparently, it's mating season
for the- the diarrhea seals.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.010
It's- It's- It's a mess.

11:22.114 --> 11:25.140
So let's just stay in the room
and enjoy our lunch.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.947
Ugh! This is awful.

11:28.054 --> 11:30.386
Whoever made this chicken
should have his hands cut off...

11:30.489 --> 11:32.514
then his feet cut off,
then shot and killed.

11:39.498 --> 11:41.659
maybe you should ease up
on the staff a little.

11:41.767 --> 11:45.066
No. No. You're paying good money
for us to stay here. It should be perfect.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.900
I mean, look at these dirty floors.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.871
Whoever mops them
should be beaten with a hose...

11:48.974 --> 11:51.534
then tied up with said hose
and thrown off the roof.

Here it comes.

12:11.059 --> 12:12.822
Wait for it.

12:14.962 --> 12:16.429
Hey!

12:17.065 --> 12:18.464
Hello, Schmuely.

12:18.566 --> 12:21.364
The fuck did you just call me?

12:21.469 --> 12:23.596
- You heard me.
- Look, Steve.

12:23.704 --> 12:26.502
Getting accidental mom boob
is one thing...

12:26.607 --> 12:30.771
but getting accidental mom forehead
brushed on your hangsters is going too far.

12:30.878 --> 12:32.402
I won't stand for it!

12:32.513 --> 12:34.105
Your mom stood for it.

12:34.215 --> 12:36.376
Steve, I now have no choice...

12:36.484 --> 12:40.443
but to get your mom
to accidentally handle my nardle-dangers.

12:41.355 --> 12:42.947
Get ready, pal.

12:43.057 --> 12:45.025
Your mom's gonna touch more sack...

12:45.126 --> 12:48.254

on inventory day.

- Calm down, Stan.

12:57.004 --> 12:58.631
I'm still talking to my new friends...

12:58.739 --> 13:01.139

and his wife, Queen Sonja.

13:01.242 --> 13:03.369
Now, the freeways in Dallas are horrible.

13:03.478 --> 13:06.072
Just take a taxi from the airport.
Take taxis everywhere.

13:06.180 --> 13:08.512
And head straight for Bud's Tex-Mex.

13:08.616 --> 13:11.881
Don't bring your wife.
The bathroom scene there is amazing. Huh?

13:11.986 --> 13:13.977
Now you tell me something good.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.082
Oh, yum! Dessert.

13:22.062 --> 13:24.860
This... is...

13:24.965 --> 13:26.432

13:33.974 --> 13:35.703
Okay, dinner's over.
Roger, here's the bill.

13:35.809 --> 13:37.333
Just sign it to the room.

13:40.747 --> 13:42.214
Eh, I just want to make sure...

13:42.315 --> 13:43.942
- I didn't accidentally leave a tip.
- No!

13:44.951 --> 13:46.782
What is this, Stan?

13:48.021 --> 13:50.922
You used me, just like you always do.

13:51.024 --> 13:53.322
Look, we can talk about it
on the plane ride home.

13:54.461 --> 13:55.985
Right now we gotta
fake your assassination...

13:56.096 --> 13:58.121
and drop the general's body in your place.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.893
Here, put on these squibs.

14:01.001 --> 14:05.165
I truly thought you wanted
to go on a friends vacation with me.

14:05.272 --> 14:07.638
Actually, what I really wanted was this.

14:07.741 --> 14:10.767
- An aerial screw?
- Yup. Now, be a trouper.

14:10.877 --> 14:14.142
Go out on that balcony
and get shot 15 times in the chest.

Huh?

14:34.601 --> 14:36.228

I'm staying here and running this dump,
that's what.

14:38.939 --> 14:40.907
Guards!

14:41.007 --> 14:43.976
See that Senor Smith
leaves my country immediately.

14:44.077 --> 14:45.704
I hope your helicopter was worth it...

14:45.812 --> 14:47.507
because it cost us our friendship.

14:49.883 --> 14:52.044
People of Isla, first order of business...

14:52.152 --> 14:54.017
is changing the name of this country.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.612
It's now called Bananarama,
and the national anthem is "Venus."

14:57.724 --> 14:59.157

I will never hurt you.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.829
Stan, what are you doing?

15:41.935 --> 15:43.334
Just hugging my chopper, babe.

15:43.436 --> 15:46.530
Breakfast was quiet
without Roger this morning.

15:46.639 --> 15:48.869
Why don't you call him and apologize?

15:48.975 --> 15:50.704
Apologize? For what?

15:50.810 --> 15:54.268
For giving him power over an island
full of half-naked Hispanic men?

15:54.381 --> 15:55.848
That's his dream...

15:55.949 --> 15:58.213
and the premise of three
of his screenplays.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.117
Too bad Stan isn't here.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.087
He's the one to talk to about pants.

16:04.190 --> 16:07.751
If I'm gonna order a suit online,
I've gotta have all my measurements.

Indeed it will, Steve.

You won't know when it's coming,
but it's coming.

16:34.387 --> 16:36.014
Why aren't you getting up?

16:36.122 --> 16:38.352
I'm waiting for my wrestling
boner to go down.

16:38.458 --> 16:39.925
It's perfectly natural.

We've just received
some intel on Isla Island.

gone a bit off his nut.

would cheer me up, but it didn't.</i>

17:05.652 --> 17:07.950

<i>I thought gay people had good taste.</i>

<i>I am not gay, senor.</i>

<i>You just make me do gay things.</i>

17:14.027 --> 17:16.257
<i>Fair enough. Repaint it turquoise.</i>

17:17.396 --> 17:18.921
There's a revolution brewing...

17:19.031 --> 17:22.092
and General PequeÃ±o will be dead
by this time tomorrow.

17:22.202 --> 17:24.727
Dead? Sir, we can't let them kill him.

17:24.838 --> 17:27.932
Why? We've mined
all of Isla's natural resources.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.941
Who cares what happens to them now?

17:30.043 --> 17:31.704
But that country is our friend.

17:31.811 --> 17:34.974
Maybe we use our friends,
but we don't just abandon them.

17:35.081 --> 17:37.982
Grow up, Smith.
This is how you get the things you want.

17:38.084 --> 17:41.986
You're such a Pollyanna.
I bet you kiss prostitutes.

17:42.088 --> 17:44.352

17:51.131 --> 17:53.224
I'll help you with the groceries
in a minute, Mom.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.530
- Wait. Where are you going?
- Just stay in the car, and keep the doors locked.

17:56.636 --> 18:00.037
And don't touch anything
that looks like a mushy, hairy peach.

18:18.924 --> 18:20.482
Steve.

18:20.592 --> 18:23.584
I thought your mother
would be opening the door.

18:23.695 --> 18:25.322
Well, she didn't.

18:26.698 --> 18:28.393
So, uh...

18:28.500 --> 18:30.491
this has gone too far, hasn't it?

18:30.602 --> 18:34.663
I would say so. I would, uh, say so.

And even if you don't ski, you can gamble.
There's great shopping.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.377
You can rent a snowmobile
for, like, 200 bucks a day.

Oh, hello.

- That's not a friend.
- I know.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.897

and no more lies.

19:36.601 --> 19:38.228
Come on. Let's get you out of here...

19:38.336 --> 19:40.896
and leave General PequeÃ±o's body
for the rebels to find.
