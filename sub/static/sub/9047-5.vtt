Condom wrappers.

I put her on the pill.

00:14.948 --> 00:17.282
- Can I crash here
for the night?

00:18.618 --> 00:20.819

on my living room couch

00:20.821 --> 00:22.087
With full parental consent.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.589

Matty is in mine.

Into his timetable for

03:38.919 --> 03:39.818

her bathroom, deodorant.

for espn.

03:49.163 --> 03:50.495

the real housewives?

03:50.497 --> 03:53.031
- It's as if they were
never real at all.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.433
- Are you getting any action?

03:54.435 --> 03:55.434
- Nightly.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.435
- Every...Night.

- I don't.

at your house for over a week.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.507
- I know.
- Jenna, a backup like that

04:02.509 --> 04:05.277
Could easily become a blowup.
He has to move out.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.079
- You can never leave.

04:07.081 --> 04:07.813
- Oh, hey.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.549
- Hey.

- Oh. Um...

04:14.021 --> 04:15.287
I should get to class.

- Don't forget
to take your pill.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.026
Your mom told me
to remind you.

to make sure

04:24.898 --> 04:25.831
You're bringing alcohol
tonight.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.866

for a booze schmooze.

What are we doing?

04:28.502 --> 04:30.535

Didn't you get the email?

04:31.972 --> 04:32.537
- No.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.072
- Maybe it went to spam.
- Maybe.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.774
Did you get the one
about pom-pom hygiene?

04:35.776 --> 04:36.508
- Purelled and polished.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.976

- High cut.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.679

what kind of...

I'll be right back.

Actually, there's not gonna be
a sleepover this year.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.896
I got confused.
It happens.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.698
Bye!

04:59.700 --> 05:00.532

05:00.534 --> 05:02.100
- Why would you want to spend
a night at sadie's anyway?

05:02.102 --> 05:05.570
- Because she is still treating
me like I'm the cheer alternate

05:05.572 --> 05:07.172
When I am the cheer ultimate.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.573
I'm going to that party.
- Are you sure?

05:08.575 --> 05:10.742
- Yes! Sleepovers
are game changers.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.611
And I give
professional sleepover.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.847
The key is not to sleep
until it's over.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.283

of the canyon

05:18.285 --> 05:20.852

05:25.025 --> 05:29.161
My life made sense.

I couldn't tell.

That wasn't an attempt
to seem cool.

06:12.572 --> 06:13.538
Humility, mr. Jennings.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.341

07:00.387 --> 07:02.387
I just wanted to thank you.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.156
- For what?
- Your candor in class.

07:04.158 --> 07:06.057
- Listen, I am tired
and out of it.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.193
I don't have patience
for your sarcasm.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.661
- I wasn't being sarcastic.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.863
It was sincere.
You were right.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.733
My story was pretentious,
and I'm okay with that.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.934
But...Obvious?

07:15.936 --> 07:19.905
That's the last thing
I want to be.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.006
So thanks for being honest.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.175
It's a...
Hard thing to do.

07:23.177 --> 07:24.376
- Collin was the last guy

07:24.378 --> 07:25.544
I thought could
handle the truth.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.646
But if he could,
maybe matty could too.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.449
- And since I'm all about
quid pro quo,

07:30.451 --> 07:33.251
You might want
to check out a mirror.

07:33.253 --> 07:36.421
You've got a bit
of a 'stache.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.027
- Little experiment
gone awry, huh?

07:42.029 --> 07:44.863
Bet you wish you would have
drawn it on your finger instead.

07:44.865 --> 07:45.997
Less of a commitment.

07:45.999 --> 07:46.765
- I didn't do it.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.201
It's was mr. Hart's
idea of a joke.

07:49.203 --> 07:49.935
Fell asleep in class.

07:49.937 --> 07:53.305
- Ah, result of some
late-night sex play

07:53.307 --> 07:54.673
With the live-in?

07:54.675 --> 07:56.007
Mm, mm, mm?

07:56.009 --> 07:56.842
How's it going?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.343
- To be honest,
it's changed things.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.812
I mean...
I want to be there

08:00.814 --> 08:02.113
For matty
during this hard time.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.715
I just don't want him
to be there with me.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.785
- You need the lovin', but you
want to bring back the mystery.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.119
I feel ya.
- How do I do that

08:08.121 --> 08:10.489
Without hurting
matty's feelings?

08:10.491 --> 08:12.491
J, you came
to the right place.

08:12.493 --> 08:15.560
I am an expert at getting men
to leave my pad,

08:17.664 --> 08:18.630
While I'm sleeping.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.867
Okay, just

08:27.374 --> 08:28.874
- Right.
Better make it two.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.976
While some men can handle
the warm purr

08:30.978 --> 08:34.446
Of a single kitty,
they can't handle a cat's cat.

08:34.448 --> 08:37.414
Oh, and look for one
with anal gland issues.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.784
Unwanted cat splat
will send him a-packin'.

08:39.785 --> 08:41.419
- Val, I'm not getting
any pets.

08:41.421 --> 08:42.988
- Tried sharing
his neti pot?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.556
- I don't even know
what that is.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.124
- Baby talk during sex!

08:46.126 --> 08:48.059
Oh. Ahem.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.661
[baby voice]
ohh...

08:49.663 --> 08:53.431
Matty watty,
your little peeny weenie

08:53.433 --> 08:55.100
Is sho shnuggly wuggly.

08:55.102 --> 08:58.036
- I want him to move out,
not move on.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.404
- Well, that's all I got.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.805
Ugh, look at the time.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.340
If you have
any follow-up questions,

09:02.342 --> 09:04.276
You can call,
text, or tweet.

09:04.278 --> 09:08.547
Bowling lesson.
I gots to go.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.748
[stomach rumbling]

09:09.750 --> 09:12.584
Suddenly, so did I.

09:13.152 --> 09:14.019
The coast was clear.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.854
I finally had the house
to myself.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.823
My guilty pleasures had been
piling up all week,

09:18.825 --> 09:20.892
But with no throne
to perch on,

09:20.894 --> 09:22.360
I couldn't truly enjoy them.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.630
It was time
to take care of business.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.532
Uh, what are you
doing here?

09:27.534 --> 09:29.067
- Practice was canceled.
- Ohh. Oh.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.069
Bet you my mom
made you a snack.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.270
You wanna meet me
in the kitchen?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.872
- I'm not really hungry.
- Can you try to be?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.607
'cause I really,
really need to catch up

09:35.609 --> 09:37.042
On these important
cultural critiques.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.310
- Important.
- Yes, and I need to do it

09:38.312 --> 09:41.346
In there, alone, with scented
candles and dim lighting,

09:41.348 --> 09:42.981
And you are
driving me crazy!

09:42.983 --> 09:46.084
I love you,
but I love myself too,

09:46.086 --> 09:46.851
And I need space.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.386
And my bathroom
and my hair products.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.288
And I need privacy, matty!
- Okay, slow down.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.456
- I can't, I've kept it
all bottled up,

09:51.458 --> 09:55.760
And I just need to let it--
[passes gas loudly]

10:01.467 --> 10:02.667
- Your parents
called to remind you

10:02.669 --> 10:04.769
That they're going
to the hollywood bowl tonight.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.071
Won't be home till late.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.205
- Good to know.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.342
- And your mom left money
for pizza.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.879
Or we could just head over
to the chili cook-off.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.648
[both snicker]

10:16.650 --> 10:17.315
- [laughing]

10:17.317 --> 10:19.050
- Matty, I am so sorry.
- Oh, don't apologize.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.053
Every once in a while, we all
have to let out a little steam.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.021
- Oh, shut up.

10:23.023 --> 10:23.688
- No, hey, hey, hey.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.358
You were right to explode.
- Don't--

10:26.360 --> 10:28.693
[snickering]

10:28.695 --> 10:29.628
I am a dude.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.796
We can be a little oblivious.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.099
I didn't mean to put
so much pressure on you.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.101
[chuckles]
I have a solution.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.169
I will call jake, and I can
head over there tonight.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.605
- Somehow, matty had
made it comfortable

10:40.607 --> 10:42.207
To be uncomfortable.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.341
Don't.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.743
If you're comfortable here,

10:44.745 --> 10:47.012
You should stay
as long as you like.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.146
- Really?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.180
- No.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.081
But stay the night.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.216
We had turned off
the pressure,

10:51.218 --> 10:54.285
Which meant it was time
to turn on the fun

10:54.287 --> 10:55.353
And shift matty's gears

10:55.355 --> 10:56.988
From brother to lover.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.423
- What do you want to do?

10:58.425 --> 11:00.992
- Something we've never
done before.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.161
- You don't have to do this.
- But I do.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.229
If those girls
smell fear in me,

11:04.231 --> 11:07.632
I'll never be accepted.
- Tamara, they're evil.

11:07.634 --> 11:08.900
Do you remember
lee anne hodges?

11:08.902 --> 11:09.734
- The girl who transferred

11:09.736 --> 11:11.002
To the school
for the performing arts?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.170
- She's not
performing anything

11:12.172 --> 11:14.205
Except <i>one flew</i>
<i>over the cuckoo's nest,</i>

11:14.207 --> 11:14.806
24 hours a day.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.042
She's at a psychiatric
facility...

11:17.044 --> 11:17.442
In utah.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.377
She checked in after those girls
made her check out.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.280
- I call shenanigans.
They're just cheerleaders.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.114
- Who are out for blood.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.417
Just promise me that if
anything goes wrong in there,

11:25.419 --> 11:27.719
You'll say the word?
- What word? Our safe word?

11:27.721 --> 11:28.787
- We don't have a safe word.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.523
- Then we need one.
What is it?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.458
- Stop.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.160
- You know, I'm gonna be fine.

11:35.162 --> 11:38.897
As they say, there is
always safety in numbers.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.969
- You can't handle this.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.005
It might be painful.

11:47.007 --> 11:47.572
And dirty.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.240
- Oh, the dirtier
the better.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.843
- You sure?
- I'm ready.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.146
Pick your porn.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.816
- How 'bout that one?

11:57.818 --> 12:01.419
- <i>Asian persuasion 9?</i>

12:01.421 --> 12:03.288
You think ming is hot?

12:03.290 --> 12:05.090
- No.
- So she's not?

12:05.092 --> 12:08.660
- Eh, she's not <i>not...</i>

12:08.662 --> 12:09.294
Hot.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.061
This is a trick question.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.297
- I'm kidding.
Grow a funny bone.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.865
- I'm trying to.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.934
- Oh, <i>harry potter</i>
<i>and the half-blood whore.</i>

12:15.936 --> 12:19.070
- Call me dumbledore,
and I will show you my staff.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.305
- [laughs]

12:20.307 --> 12:21.172
I can't watch wizard porn.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.507
- But it's the only one
with a story.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.175
- Why do you need a story
beyond "this goes into that,

12:24.177 --> 12:26.344
Repeat until everyone
makes a weird face."

12:26.346 --> 12:27.178
- Because that sounds gross.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.146
- Why are we
doing this again?

12:28.148 --> 12:29.647
- 'cause...
We've gotten

12:29.649 --> 12:31.149
Way too comfortable
with each other,

12:31.151 --> 12:33.251
And we need
to shake things up.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.252
- We need to shake things up.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.353
When are the other girls
gonna get here?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.822
- Never. No one wants
to deal with sadie

12:37.824 --> 12:39.090
Now that she's broke.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.658
She can't soothe
her sadism

12:40.660 --> 12:41.793
With spa treatments
anymore.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.262
- So it's just
the three of us?

12:44.264 --> 12:47.132
- Yeah.
- I gotta make a call.

12:47.134 --> 12:47.799
- [sighs]

12:47.801 --> 12:50.068
- Jake, you need to stop
doing whatever you're doing

12:50.070 --> 12:52.337
And stop me from staying
the night--hurry!

12:52.339 --> 12:54.939
- Consuela's gonna give us
mani-pedis,

12:54.941 --> 12:56.374
But she only has energy
for two,

12:56.376 --> 13:00.645
So, tamara, feel free
to wait outside...

13:00.647 --> 13:01.980
With my dog.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.381
- Thanks for your lack
of hospitality,

13:03.383 --> 13:04.749
But I think
I'm gonna head out.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.252
- Good! Now I won't feel bad
talking [bleep] about you

13:07.254 --> 13:08.920
To your face.
- Oh, please.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.688
Don't hold back.
- Really?

13:10.690 --> 13:13.324
Because I do have
a question for you.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.325
- Bring it.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.493
- When you kiss jake,

13:15.495 --> 13:16.928
Does it taste like jenna?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.663
- I don't know--
when you kissed ricky,

13:18.665 --> 13:19.864
Did it taste like me?

13:19.866 --> 13:20.832
- Skitch.
- Whore.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.300
- Guys, let's not
get wound up.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.670
- Consuela,
get my spirit board.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.877
- Unlocking the afterlife
can be really dangerous.

13:32.879 --> 13:33.645
We should keep it locked.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.680
How about we play
"light as a feather" instead?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.248
- Ricky, if you can hear me,

13:37.250 --> 13:38.716
Set the record straight.

13:38.718 --> 13:42.921
Did you love me
more than this [bleep].

13:47.860 --> 13:51.696
- Ricky, were you attracted
to sadie's mannish appearance

13:51.698 --> 13:54.833
Because you were gay?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.305
- Guys, I--
I brought <i>tangled.</i>

14:00.307 --> 14:05.410
- Did the thought of tamara's
face put you in the grave?

14:06.745 --> 14:10.281
- Or did sadie shove you
in there herself?

14:14.453 --> 14:17.121
- Was your death an accident?

14:19.692 --> 14:21.226
- [gasps]

14:21.228 --> 14:23.828
- Did someone kill you?

14:23.830 --> 14:25.263
Both: Who killed you?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.931
- This is not okay!

14:26.933 --> 14:30.101
Let the spirits rest!

14:32.571 --> 14:34.038
- I need a ride home.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.974
- Okay.
Just waiting on tamara.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.175
- She's not coming.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.543
[phone bloops]

14:38.545 --> 14:39.277
She's not coming.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.912
- Do you believe
in the afterlife?

14:40.914 --> 14:41.479
- In what way?

14:41.481 --> 14:43.848
- In the way that your sins
come back to haunt you.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.183
- You mean like karma?

14:45.185 --> 14:46.184
- Yeah.

14:46.186 --> 14:46.985
- Sure.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.420
- I think god's punishing me.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.521
- ♪ oh oh oh ♪

14:50.523 --> 14:53.157
- I lost my virginity
this summer.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.827
- [british accent] I'm not ready
to lose my virginity.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.896
- Is that supposed to
be hermione?

14:57.898 --> 15:00.431
- Less watching,
more kissing.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.834
Mmm.
- [on tv] oh, yeah!

15:02.836 --> 15:03.902
Ohh!

15:03.904 --> 15:05.069
- Why would someone do this?

15:05.071 --> 15:07.472
- Oh, I don't know.
Costume fetish?

15:07.474 --> 15:10.341
[both giggle]

15:10.343 --> 15:11.876
- Oh. I'm sorry.

15:11.878 --> 15:12.911
But look at that girl.

15:12.913 --> 15:13.745
She's actually pretty.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.546
She could have been
a real actress.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.015
- Yeah, if she could act.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.316
- She's probably a runaway.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.818
- So?
- So it's disturbing.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.487
It's not like there are
little girls who run around

15:22.489 --> 15:24.255
Saying, "when I grow up,
I want to have sex

15:24.257 --> 15:25.323
With strange men
on camera."

15:25.325 --> 15:27.892
It's sad.
- What's sad is how much

15:27.894 --> 15:29.494
You're killing the moment.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.161
- Way to be insensitive.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.597
It's not like those girls
have their boyfriends' homes

15:32.599 --> 15:36.935
To run off to
when things get tough.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.670
- You know, I'm--
I'm tired.

15:38.672 --> 15:39.304
I'm gonna crash.

15:39.306 --> 15:42.440
I'll be out of here
in the morning.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.812
- That's it.
Let it happen.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.348
Off to dreamland.
- No.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.250
No, I won't go there.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.685
Unless you want
to call a truce?

15:53.687 --> 15:55.887
If you let me sleep,
I will let you sleep

15:55.889 --> 15:57.288
And I'll leave
first thing in the morning.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.890
You don't even
have to feed me.

15:58.892 --> 15:59.991
- Oh, I won't.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.392
Good.
- Great.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.961
Both: Truce.

16:09.768 --> 16:11.436
- Your bed is the floor.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.204
Or you can sleep
in my dog's bed,

16:13.206 --> 16:14.172
Since he's with consuela.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.307
- But there's plenty of room
for both of us in yours.

16:16.309 --> 16:20.712
- It's non-negotiable.
I don't co-sleep.

16:29.321 --> 16:34.392
- [whimpering and crying]

16:34.394 --> 16:36.194
- What is wrong with you?

16:36.196 --> 16:38.062
- I have a bad back.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.832
- And I don't care.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.634
- [whimpering like a dog]

16:43.636 --> 16:45.136
- Are you gonna
do that all night

16:45.138 --> 16:46.804
Unless I let you up here?

16:46.806 --> 16:48.006
- Yes.
- Fine!

16:48.008 --> 16:50.308
But don't touch me.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.979
- [sighs]

17:05.790 --> 17:07.892
Matty, we need to talk.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.328
- Uh, not now.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.096
- I'm sorry.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.133
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.667
Please don't make me
do this through the door.

17:17.670 --> 17:18.869
- I'll just be a minute.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.003
- That's when
I realized matty

17:20.006 --> 17:22.339
Might have been working out
another problem.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.343
- Oh, my god,
are you shaking the...

17:33.519 --> 17:37.288
- So our comfort zone had
finally gotten uncomfortable.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.122
For both of us.

17:38.124 --> 17:41.726
I finally realized
matty didn't need a lover.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.728
He needed a mother.

17:43.730 --> 17:47.899
Maybe it's time
you talked to your parents.

17:47.901 --> 17:48.866
- Why?

17:48.868 --> 17:52.737
They haven't called
since I left.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.105
- That's pride.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.306
I didn't talk to jennifer

17:55.308 --> 17:56.941
Days after she found out
I wrote the letter,

17:56.943 --> 18:00.845
And I'm the one
who made that mess.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.447
- And what'd she do?

18:02.449 --> 18:03.681
- She let me process...

18:03.683 --> 18:05.983
How to talk to her
and then,

18:05.985 --> 18:07.552
When I didn't,

18:07.554 --> 18:09.587
She found the strength
to talk to me.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.657
There's no instruction manual
on how to parent.

18:12.659 --> 18:17.495
Sometimes, our kids have
to teach us what they need.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.698
Jenna did that for me.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.468

for your mom too?
