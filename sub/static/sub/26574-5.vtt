about us?

00:07.216 --> 00:08.592
There is no "us."

00:08.592 --> 00:10.928
Trey told me what happened
in that car.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.722
It was exactly the way Violet
predicted it would go down.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.600
‐But that was‐‐
‐Exactly the way
she predicted it.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.810
‐I'm gonna go to her house.
‐What? Why?

00:18.810 --> 00:21.021
Because I'm not gonna wait
until you drown

00:21.021 --> 00:22.814
or Alex chokes out
to do something about it.

What time is it?

00:56.807 --> 00:58.016
7:15.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.935
I thought I'd let you sleep in

00:59.935 --> 01:04.314
since you were
tossing and turning last night.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.441
Oh, was I?

01:06.441 --> 01:08.402
I'm sorry.
I hope I didn't wake you.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.653
No.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.617
Only when you were
having that nightmare.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.455
Nightmare?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.751
Right.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.921
Sorry.
That's... embarrassing.

Do you remember
what it was about?

01:33.719 --> 01:34.970
No.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.180
It was probably
just me being unprepared

01:37.180 --> 01:38.473
for an exam or something.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.058
I have those a lot.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.227
[Violet] Right.

Well, I'm gonna finish
getting ready,

Allie, honey, we know you've
been through a lot recently.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.645
But this has to stop.

you're not telling us?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.318
No.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.404
No, I just messed up.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.662
[Mr. Portnoy]
I talked Principal Morris

want to come over later

Uh, maybe. Just text me.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.828
[Candace] So you survived
the night with the psycho?

Seriously, if you didn't
show this morning,

04:06.037 --> 04:06.955
I was gonna call the cops.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.503
Hey. Are you okay?

04:13.503 --> 04:15.172
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

I mean, this is serious.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.346
You know what that shit
can do.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.806
You're right.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.058
I'm sorry,

04:27.058 --> 04:29.394
especially after everything
we went‐‐

04:29.394 --> 04:32.189
‐Wait. Did you buy
from Trey?
‐God, no.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.065
We need to talk
about Marc Regan.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.692
Wait, sorry.
What's happening?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.819
Marc Regan. It's this guy
that Violet dated.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.405
She has this bizarre shrine
of him in her room.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.698
[Candace] Wait, what?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.158
Marc Regan.
Why do I know that name?

04:43.158 --> 04:45.076
Maybe Olivia mentioned him?

04:45.076 --> 04:47.037
Marc and Henry used to compete
against each other in tennis.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.830
Huge rivalry.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.791
The messed up thing is,

04:50.791 --> 04:52.584
Marc had everything
going for him.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.127
Then one day,
out of the blue,

04:54.127 --> 04:55.587
he just jumps off a bridge.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.880
‐I think I heard about that.
‐Oh, my God.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.215
[McKenna]
Why would he do that?

04:58.215 --> 05:02.093
I have no idea,
but I'm gonna find out.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.638
[Candace] Since when are you
hanging out with Trey?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.765
Yeah, do we have
to start smoking
behind the auto shop now?

05:06.765 --> 05:08.517
Look, he's just as much
in this as we are.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.435
And what about Henry?

05:10.435 --> 05:13.605
No, let's just
not get him involved, okay?

05:13.605 --> 05:16.608
So Violet has a shrine
to this Marc guy,

05:16.608 --> 05:17.818
and he killed himself.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.528
That's freakin' weird.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.159
Do you think she killed him?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.286
I don't know.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.789
But from now on,
we need to watch our backs.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.644
The first thing I noticed
when I got to Willow Falls High

05:52.644 --> 05:54.896
‐was how nice everybody was.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.739
I'm gonna go grab
a battery pack out of my locker.

06:04.739 --> 06:05.615
Candace, you're up first.

the most awesome senior year

you're talking to a friend.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.139
What?

06:29.139 --> 06:32.517
The camera.
Pretend it's your best friend.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.977
You know,
like if Olivia was here,

06:33.977 --> 06:35.270
what would you want to say?

06:35.270 --> 06:36.313
Can you please
just stop talking?

06:37.689 --> 06:38.773
Okay, sorry.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.025
I'm just trying to be nice.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.192
Look, I'm on to you.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.153
Okay?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.613
What do you mean?

06:44.613 --> 06:46.364
You killed my best friend.

06:46.364 --> 06:50.535
Wow. I mean, Isaac said
that you had issues, but I‐‐

06:50.535 --> 06:53.246
Isaac was talking
to you about me?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.665
He only said a few things.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.043
We've been getting close lately.

06:58.043 --> 07:01.171
You're lying.
He would never do that.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.257
Candace, you'd be surprised
what guilt does to people.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.178
Especially after someone dies.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.723

07:21.566 --> 07:23.610

07:23.610 --> 07:27.072
You and Isaac were hooking up
behind Olivia's back.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.407
You're her best friend.

The whole school's watching.

You bitch!

07:58.937 --> 08:00.522
You set me up!

08:00.522 --> 08:03.108
No! Stanley must have
left it on by accident.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.025

08:24.963 --> 08:26.715
Oh, my God,
she ruined my life.

No, she didn't. Just breathe.

No! How long
was it going on?!

That's...
It's none of your business.

Well, it was definitely
Olivia's business.

Hi.
Um, my name's Trey Emory,

09:13.178 --> 09:17.640

a question about your son, Marc.

going to pep rallies?

Yeah, it's
not really my thing,

the class president results,

probably be there for Candace.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.756
You didn't,
and it's gonna be fine.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.758
Okay? It's fine.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.058
[Henry] McKenna?

13:30.268 --> 13:32.603
[cheering in auditorium]

13:32.603 --> 13:33.896
Why are you here?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.734
Morris asked me to come
and say something at the rally.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.444
[Trey] Go team.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.322
Call me later, okay?

13:46.117 --> 13:47.285
What was that about?

13:48.786 --> 13:51.247
You know
who that guy is, right?

13:51.247 --> 13:53.833
Yeah. I've known him
since I was six.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.794
Yeah, and he was also driving
the car that killed my‐‐

14:01.549 --> 14:03.885
Just‐‐

14:03.885 --> 14:06.888
Just promise me
you'll be careful.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.306
Okay.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.393
[Mr. Morris, on P. A.]
Henry Richmond!

14:12.393 --> 14:15.146
[cheering and applause]

14:32.622 --> 14:34.957
Last time
I was up on this stage,

14:36.167 --> 14:37.752
a lot was different.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.796
[Henry continues indistinctly
in background]

14:41.964 --> 14:43.633
Hey.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.802
Didn't think
you were gonna show.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.137
On your big election
results night?

14:48.137 --> 14:49.263
Think I'd miss that?

14:49.263 --> 14:50.807
Guess not.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.268
Have they announced
anything yet?

14:54.268 --> 14:55.770
No, but come on.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.688
I already know Violet's
gonna destroy me.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.315
I had to come, though.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.817
Didn't want to give her
the satisfaction.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.029
I'm not gonna
pretend to understand

15:05.029 --> 15:06.572
what happened
between you and Isaac,

15:06.572 --> 15:09.033
but I'm always here for you.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.576
No matter what.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.496
[Henry] So, I hope
I can speak for my sister

15:13.496 --> 15:15.998
when I say, "Go, Wolves!"

15:15.998 --> 15:17.542
And let's go out there
this season

15:17.542 --> 15:19.293
in each and every game,

15:19.293 --> 15:20.336
let's kick some ass!

15:20.336 --> 15:22.046
[cheering and applause]

15:22.046 --> 15:23.214
Thank you.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.764
How's that for school spirit?

15:31.764 --> 15:34.267
Okay, now, can I have
your attention, please?

15:34.267 --> 15:37.270
I have a brief,
but very exciting announcement.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.481
I have the results of today's
class president elections.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.693
So without further ado,
I'm pleased to announce

15:43.693 --> 15:46.654
that your new
Senior Class President is...

15:53.077 --> 15:55.454
Violet Simmons.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.248
Congratulations, Violet.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.458
You want to
come up and say a few words?

16:11.012 --> 16:12.930
I know you sabotaged me.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.683
And I'm gonna prove
that you killed Olivia.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.059
[Violet] Better hurry.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.477
You might be next.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.563
What did you just say to me?!

16:20.563 --> 16:23.232
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.358
[Mr. Morris]
Ladies, what's going on here?

16:24.358 --> 16:26.194
She just threatened me!

16:26.194 --> 16:28.696
But first she killed Olivia!

16:28.696 --> 16:31.657
I don't know how she did it,
but it was her!

16:31.657 --> 16:34.160
And she said I'm next. Don't you
ever threaten me like that.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.328
[Violet] I didn't say
anything to you!

16:35.328 --> 16:37.246
Just stay away!
You're insane!

16:37.246 --> 16:39.415
No, you're a psycho!
You're a bitch!

16:39.415 --> 16:41.042
[McKenna]
Candace, stop! Stop!

16:41.042 --> 16:42.418
[Mr. Morris]
Miss Preston, that is enough!

16:42.418 --> 16:44.754
No, she's crazy,
and she killed Olivia!

16:44.754 --> 16:46.714
Let me go!
McKenna, tell them!

16:46.714 --> 16:48.216
It was her!

16:48.216 --> 16:49.467
‐It was her!
‐Get her out! Get her out!

16:50.968 --> 16:53.137
McKenna, please take your seat.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.347
Please.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.743
You okay?

17:15.743 --> 17:18.871
Candace freaked out
again in the parking lot.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.040
I don't know why she hates me.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.709
I mean, they all do.
I try so hard to be nice.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.002
I know.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.840
These girls have been tight
for the longest time,

17:29.840 --> 17:32.677
and when Olivia died,
it messed them up.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.804
It messed all of us up.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.098
I understand.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.269
I'm still a little bit
shaken up, though.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.853
Do you mind
giving me a ride home?

17:46.816 --> 17:48.734
Sure, yeah.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.952
Thank you for the ride.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.161
Anytime.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.125
Is everything okay?

18:04.125 --> 18:08.296
Um... yeah, yeah.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.508
Um, Alex talked
to Candace's mom,

18:12.508 --> 18:14.468
and she's home, so...

18:15.845 --> 18:18.055
Well, that's good.

18:18.055 --> 18:18.931
Yeah.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.812
Look, I'm sorry about earlier.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.397
I know you and Trey
have history.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.566
It's just seeing
that guy's face, I...

18:28.566 --> 18:29.692
No, I get it.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.363
Things are really messed up
right now.

18:34.363 --> 18:38.492
I just wish we could have
one normal night

18:38.492 --> 18:40.870
without something crazy
happening.

18:43.456 --> 18:47.293
Well, night's not over yet.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.254
Yeah.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.259
My mom
does have a night shift.

Yeah, I do.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.910
I should probably go.

Thank you again
for the ride home, Isaac.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.289
You're such a great guy.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.083
Yeah, no problem.

Hey, do you want to hang out
for a little bit?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.921
Um, okay.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.063
Don't go anywhere.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.231
