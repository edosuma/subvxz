Tehran, Iran

02:17.940 --> 02:19.339
Bobby, where have you been?

02:19.508 --> 02:21.135
Whiskey, whiskey.

02:22.478 --> 02:24.503
- You want some whiskey?
- No, champagne.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.944
- Champagne? Yeah.
- Bob.

02:27.116 --> 02:28.777
My brother wants to know...

02:28.984 --> 02:32.317
have you ever tried liquid MDMA?

02:32.488 --> 02:34.922
Liquid MDMA? No.

02:37.626 --> 02:40.356
Tehran is the world capital.

02:40.529 --> 02:41.757
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

02:41.931 --> 02:44.263
You've got a... friend there.

02:52.942 --> 02:54.239
How's the kid?

02:55.711 --> 02:57.406
He's fine.

02:58.147 --> 02:59.512
He's....

02:59.682 --> 03:01.274
He's fine.

03:06.589 --> 03:08.716
Arash, when you wanna do this?

03:09.825 --> 03:12.055
After prayer.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.855
Okay.

04:37.046 --> 04:40.675
- You said they were both for you.
- What do you care?

05:09.778 --> 05:11.245
Not a move!

05:11.413 --> 05:13.108
Okay. Okay.

05:13.282 --> 05:14.806
I was looking for the bathroom.

05:14.984 --> 05:17.509
Not a word. Shut up!

05:17.753 --> 05:19.516
Okay.

05:26.362 --> 05:29.092
You don't speak Farsi, do you,
you son of a goat?

06:00.696 --> 06:04.223
Georgetown Washington, DC

06:14.043 --> 06:16.944
Mr. Whiting, I'm Bennett Holiday.

06:18.581 --> 06:21.948
A very big company, Connex, our client...

06:23.786 --> 06:29.019
Ioses a huge natural-gas contract
in the Persian Gulf...

06:29.191 --> 06:31.659
to the Chinese. At the same time...

06:31.827 --> 06:36.594
a smaller company, Killen,
somehow gets the rights to Kazakhstan...

06:36.765 --> 06:39.859
one of the largest
untapped oil fields in the world.

06:40.035 --> 06:43.334
The big company, our client,
merges with Killen...

06:43.505 --> 06:46.599
Justice wants to know
how Killen got those rights.

06:47.309 --> 06:50.403
You've been scrutinizing
exactly these types of deals...

06:50.579 --> 06:52.672
so if there's something to find...

06:52.848 --> 06:55.578
I expect you to get it before they do.

06:55.751 --> 06:57.878
And come straight to me.

07:02.891 --> 07:04.381
Bennett.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.050
Sir?

07:07.896 --> 07:11.764
At my firm, I have a flock of sheep...

07:11.934 --> 07:14.562
who think they're lions.

07:16.705 --> 07:20.038
Maybe you're a lion
everyone thinks is a sheep.

07:24.046 --> 07:27.038
No, I wanna talk about the Gulf,
and how a goddamn emir...

07:27.216 --> 07:28.513
Connex Oil Houston, Texas

07:28.684 --> 07:31.517
- What is an emir anyway?
- King, it's a king.

07:31.687 --> 07:36.488
A king. Well, how some Podunk king
tossed you out on your ass.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.958
Every company in the world
wanted into Kazakhstan...

07:42.131 --> 07:45.225
into the Tengiz, but Killen got it.

07:46.568 --> 07:49.867
And then Connex wanted Killen,
and here we are.

07:53.609 --> 07:55.577
I made investments.

07:56.078 --> 07:59.707
Investments that'll bear fruit
for this company.

08:01.250 --> 08:04.617
Hell, Tommy, we've all got
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act...

08:04.787 --> 08:07.017
committed to memory.

08:07.189 --> 08:11.250
I got a little copy of it taped
to the wall of my head. Right here.

08:11.527 --> 08:14.087
Thanks, Jimmy.
We appreciate hearing your point of view.

08:15.464 --> 08:17.591
However, a U.S. Attorney...

08:17.766 --> 08:20.701
is looking into your relationships
in Kazakhstan...

08:20.869 --> 08:24.236
and the U.S. government is holding off
on approval of our merger.

08:24.406 --> 08:26.067
So Mr. Janus and I have brought...

08:26.241 --> 08:28.402
Connex's Washington counsel,
Sydney Hewitt...

08:28.577 --> 08:31.910
down here to talk about
our strategy for the next 30 days.

08:32.081 --> 08:33.809
Sydney?

08:41.123 --> 08:43.591
In a way, I feel like Switzerland.

08:45.494 --> 08:49.590
I'd like to remind everybody in this room
they've signed confidentiality agreements.

08:52.301 --> 08:55.668
Allow me to introduce my associate,
Bennett Holiday...

08:55.838 --> 08:58.398
who will be... How shall I put it?

08:58.574 --> 09:01.771
Building consensus day-to-day.

09:01.944 --> 09:03.206
Good morning.

09:19.862 --> 09:21.762
You've just visited what
someday soon...

09:21.930 --> 09:24.455
could be the most profitable
corporation in America.

09:24.633 --> 09:26.396
Provided the government
approves the merger.

09:26.568 --> 09:29.093
Provided we don't start
running automobiles on water.

09:29.271 --> 09:32.138
And provided there's still chaos
in the Middle East.

09:32.307 --> 09:35.708
Now the job is, find the problem,
fix the problem.

09:35.878 --> 09:39.507
And if you do not find a problem,
then there is no problem.

09:39.681 --> 09:42.411
And when the government
approves this merger...

09:42.584 --> 09:44.950
it's gonna buy a lot of houses
in the Vineyard.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.883
Maybe even yours.

09:48.123 --> 09:51.388
Geneva, Switzerland

10:03.672 --> 10:05.003
Cheerios again?

10:07.709 --> 10:09.301
- Max!
- Max!

10:14.516 --> 10:17.246
- Hey, man.
- Let's not read at the table, okay?

10:17.419 --> 10:19.649
- Put this hand here. Block me.
- Sweetie, sweetie.

10:19.822 --> 10:22.052
- Mommy? I want bacon.
- Yeah?

10:22.591 --> 10:25.025
- You have bacon.
- I want real bacon.

10:25.194 --> 10:28.823
You have real bacon,
only it's made from soy beans.

10:31.033 --> 10:32.466
I want pig bacon.

10:32.634 --> 10:35.501
I want pig bacon too.

10:37.606 --> 10:39.597
- Don't say it.
- I'll try it if you try it.

10:39.775 --> 10:41.936
- I don't know if I can bite this.
- It's crunchy.

10:45.447 --> 10:48.416
- How'd you do that?
- It's kind of hard to cut.

10:48.584 --> 10:50.677
- It's pretty bad.
- You be quiet.

10:51.687 --> 10:56.181
<i>A merger between two U.S. oil companies
is taking place in Houston.</i>

10:56.358 --> 10:59.191
<i>The new company,
Connex-Killen Corporation...</i>

10:59.361 --> 11:03.024
<i>will become the fifth largest
oil and gas company in the world.</i>

11:03.198 --> 11:07.897
<i>The move affects 37,000 workers
in 160 countries...</i>

11:08.070 --> 11:12.530
<i>and, with revenues larger than the gross
domestic product of Pakistan or Denmark...</i>

11:12.708 --> 11:16.439
<i>will create the world's
23rd largest economy.</i>

11:17.779 --> 11:20.680
<i>Mr. Leland Janus, chairman of Connex,
spoke today of synergy...</i>

11:20.849 --> 11:23.943
<i>and a desire to pass on savings
to the consumer.</i>

11:24.119 --> 11:26.747
The merged operations
will create economies of scale...

11:26.922 --> 11:30.551
to deliver the best products to
the consumer at the lowest possible prices.

11:30.726 --> 11:32.216
LELAND JANUS
CEO, CONNEX OIL

11:33.061 --> 11:35.325
<i>It's a merger of necessity
for Connex, Rebecca...</i>

11:35.497 --> 11:39.729
<i>who wants Killen's fields in Kazakhstan,
after gas blocks they pursued in the Gulf...</i>

11:39.902 --> 11:41.961
<i>were awarded
to a Chinese consortium.</i>

11:42.137 --> 11:45.334
<i>Producer nations continue to look
toward developing markets in Asia...</i>

11:45.507 --> 11:47.907
<i>which is having a powerful effect
on crude prices.</i>

11:49.544 --> 11:52.138
<i>There's at least 10 to 12 dollars
of instability premium.</i>

11:52.314 --> 11:55.511
You have protests in Iran,
the threat of more strikes in Venezuela...

11:55.684 --> 12:00.087
and the Turks still making noise about
Russian crude through the Bosphorus.

12:00.255 --> 12:02.985
All right, thanks for having me, Rebecca.

12:05.794 --> 12:08.854
<i>I'm playing. That's my job, playing.</i>

12:09.031 --> 12:12.933
Yeah, well, that's a very,
very good job for you to have.

12:13.101 --> 12:16.161
<i>- Tell Daddy you love him.
- I love you, Daddy.</i>

12:17.105 --> 12:18.629
Hey.

12:20.943 --> 12:23.878
The emir's summer party,
Marbella, this weekend.

12:24.413 --> 12:25.675
Any interest?

12:25.847 --> 12:27.838
Well, I can't. I got, you know....

12:28.016 --> 12:30.382
Guy could be huge
for the company, Bryan.

12:30.552 --> 12:33.783
It's Maxie's birthday this weekend, so...
So we have Saturday...

12:33.956 --> 12:38.052
Hey, Bryan, I just need your help on
this... The emir's party. I'll take that.

12:38.226 --> 12:40.717
Through finagling,
we have an audience with the emir.

12:40.896 --> 12:43.729
He wrote the strategy, and he's not slick.

12:43.999 --> 12:45.398
I'll bet you a thousand he can't sell it.

12:45.567 --> 12:46.727
I didn't say I could go.

12:46.902 --> 12:48.130
Dollars or Swiss francs?

12:48.303 --> 12:49.702
- Dollars.
- Fine.

12:49.972 --> 12:54.534
Come on. Take the children with you. The
beach, summer, Marbella. Max'll love it.

12:54.710 --> 12:57.008
- Can I do that?
- Sure you can.

12:57.179 --> 12:59.238
Besides, they love children.

12:59.915 --> 13:03.578
John D. Rockefeller.
Founded the University of Chicago.

13:03.752 --> 13:04.980
Come on.

13:24.139 --> 13:27.199
<i>That's fine. You're a good song leader,
Mr. Rockefeller.</i>

13:29.945 --> 13:33.779
The Persian Gulf

14:08.216 --> 14:11.982
The Connex/ Al-Salwa facility
is under new ownership...

14:12.154 --> 14:15.851
and your services are no longer needed.

14:21.063 --> 14:23.793
What did he say? I can't hear.

14:23.965 --> 14:25.364
He's telling us to scram.

14:25.534 --> 14:26.728
"Scram"?

14:27.569 --> 14:30.299
What do you mean, "scram"?

14:30.572 --> 14:36.272
Your immigration permit through
this company is no longer valid.

14:36.445 --> 14:42.179
You must report to the Department
of Immigration within two weeks...

14:42.350 --> 14:46.309
or you may be deported.

14:48.757 --> 14:52.523
The Chinese are smart people,
but such bad drivers.

14:52.694 --> 14:55.993
They should not be allowed
even to wash cars.

14:58.867 --> 15:03.497
When I was your age, in Pakistan,
there was always in the distance....

15:04.072 --> 15:07.405
Snow-covered mountains.
Yes, I know, Papa.

15:07.576 --> 15:08.975
That's right.

15:09.611 --> 15:13.604
Three hours away, but right there...

15:14.449 --> 15:16.713
across the entire sky...

15:16.985 --> 15:20.421
like you could reach out
and touch them.

15:21.089 --> 15:23.956
Snow-covered mountains.

15:28.063 --> 15:29.997
As soon as we can...

15:30.165 --> 15:33.726
we'll get a house and bring
your mother here.

15:34.603 --> 15:36.366
I promise.

16:01.229 --> 16:03.220
<i>Bob's freaking out
about this other missile.</i>

16:03.632 --> 16:06.032
"Where's the missile? Who has it?"
He wrote a memo.

16:06.201 --> 16:08.226
Central Intelligence Agency
Langley, Virginia

16:08.403 --> 16:10.837
I just finished convincing
Brit and French intel...

16:11.006 --> 16:13.406
we had nothing to do
with the Amiri job.

16:13.575 --> 16:16.601
What do we say to them now?
"Well, something's missing."

16:16.778 --> 16:20.236
<i>He's gotta stop this.
He's gotta stop with the memos.</i>

16:25.187 --> 16:28.714
<i>Okay. Here's something.
You put him up for promotion.</i>

16:29.124 --> 16:32.093
He's due. He's a good man.
He saved our ass in Beirut in '85.

16:32.260 --> 16:35.286
That's great. Terry likes him.
We'll get him an audition downtown.

16:35.463 --> 16:37.829
<i>You get him an audition downtown.</i>

16:37.999 --> 16:40.559
<i>They're going crazy about Iran now.
Bob's an expert.</i>

16:40.735 --> 16:42.202
<i>Speaks Farsi, for chrissake.</i>

16:43.104 --> 16:45.072
<i>Bob has never had a desk job.</i>

16:45.240 --> 16:47.606
<i>He's never done 9 to 5,
never been on committee.</i>

16:48.043 --> 16:51.410
He's gotta show up to work every day.
He's gotta stay on message.

16:53.582 --> 16:55.243
Absolutely.

16:56.451 --> 16:58.043
<i>I'll prep him.</i>

16:58.653 --> 17:01.679
In fact, we just pulled
one of our officers out.

17:01.856 --> 17:04.381
I took the initiative to ask him
to come down here.

17:05.126 --> 17:10.063
He infiltrated Hezbollah in Beirut
in the '80s, won himself some nice medals.

17:10.365 --> 17:12.265
We're thinking about
giving him a station.

17:12.434 --> 17:15.869
Beirut in the '80s,
is that a résumé-builder?

17:17.405 --> 17:20.271
Don't chomp down on any bait.

17:20.442 --> 17:21.704
We're fine.

17:21.876 --> 17:23.741
Iran is fine.

17:23.979 --> 17:25.469
Fine.

17:27.115 --> 17:31.313
And our analysis seems to be on the mark.
We're getting good satellite coverage.

17:31.486 --> 17:33.420
We're reprogramming resources
into Iran...

17:33.588 --> 17:36.580
Thank you for coming.
Welcome back and forgive me if I wade in...

17:36.758 --> 17:39.727
but forgetting for a second
your bureaucratic checklist...

17:39.894 --> 17:43.295
I'm trying to get
undigested information.

17:44.933 --> 17:48.699
- Well, to the best of our ability...
- India is now our ally. Russia is our ally.

17:48.870 --> 17:50.394
Even China will be an ally.

17:50.572 --> 17:53.871
Everybody between Morocco
and Pakistan is the problem.

17:54.042 --> 17:59.537
Failed states and failed economies, but
Iran is a natural cultural ally of the U.S.

17:59.714 --> 18:02.740
Persians do not want to roll back
the clock to the eighth century.

18:02.917 --> 18:06.580
I see students marching in the streets.
I hear Khatami making the right sounds.

18:06.755 --> 18:10.691
And what I'd like to know is,
if we keep embargoing them on energy...

18:10.859 --> 18:13.692
then someday soon,
are we gonna have a nice, secular...

18:13.862 --> 18:16.888
pro-Western, pro-business government?

18:22.003 --> 18:23.664
It's possible. It's complicated.

18:23.838 --> 18:25.806
Of course it is. Thank you for your time.

18:34.449 --> 18:38.249
They let young people march in the street.
Next day, they shut down 50 newspapers.

18:39.054 --> 18:42.581
<i>Put a few satellite dishes up on the roofs,
let them have My Two Dads.</i>

18:42.757 --> 18:44.349
That doesn't mean the ayatollahs...

18:44.526 --> 18:47.962
are surrendering one iota of control
over that nation.

18:48.129 --> 18:50.154
Mr. Barnes,
the reform movement in Iran...

18:50.332 --> 18:53.358
is one of the president's
great hopes for the region...

18:53.535 --> 18:57.130
and crucial to the petroleum security
of the United States.

18:58.106 --> 19:00.540
These gentlemen are with the CLI.

19:03.812 --> 19:08.044
The Committee for the Liberation of Iran,
Mr. Barnes.

19:11.519 --> 19:14.181
Princeton, New Jersey

19:18.193 --> 19:21.321
Maybe you'll get made ambassador
to somewhere cool.

19:21.496 --> 19:25.262
Like France or Italy or Ghana.

19:25.567 --> 19:29.663
It's not beyond the realm
of possibility, is it?

19:32.507 --> 19:34.338
How's your mom?

19:35.076 --> 19:37.476
Great. She's great.

19:38.980 --> 19:41.346
So I know it's still a year away...

19:41.516 --> 19:43.848
but I'll have to have a car,
a decent car.

19:44.018 --> 19:49.479
Nothing too fancy, but it has to run
so that I can get into Boston and New York.

19:49.758 --> 19:52.625
They have a great crew.
That's what they told me.

19:52.794 --> 19:55.285
I said, "Crew of what?"
And they said, "Rowing."

19:55.463 --> 19:57.931
- So if I wanna row, it'd be kind of fun.
- Thank you.

19:58.099 --> 19:59.896
Robby, listen.

20:00.969 --> 20:02.800
I live in Maryland...

20:03.438 --> 20:08.273
which means that you have
residency in Maryland.

20:08.443 --> 20:10.673
For the University of Maryland.

20:15.717 --> 20:18.686
I'm sorry, can I steal this from you?
Thank you so much.

20:22.424 --> 20:24.858
I just want a normal senior year, Dad.

20:25.226 --> 20:27.387
I want a normal house.

20:27.562 --> 20:30.463
I want Cinemax and prom.

20:30.698 --> 20:33.633
You know what prom is like in Pakistan?
Prom sucks in Pakistan.

20:33.802 --> 20:36.236
It's complicated, you know.

20:36.404 --> 20:38.838
I may have really screwed up at work.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.404
How?

20:40.575 --> 20:43.043
I was supposed to keep
my mouth shut and I didn't.

20:48.049 --> 20:52.486
What does Mom do, again,
that we have to live in Islamabad?

21:01.996 --> 21:04.692
- She's a secretary.
- Secretary.

21:10.405 --> 21:11.895
Robby.

21:12.073 --> 21:14.200
Both of my parents are professional liars.

21:14.375 --> 21:15.842
Hey.

21:23.585 --> 21:25.746
Did you guys just get a party?

21:25.920 --> 21:27.581
I do too.

21:28.823 --> 21:31.656
This is a party not for you.

21:32.827 --> 21:36.354
Marbella, Spain

21:37.966 --> 21:41.902
<i>It is my pleasure to personally welcome
each of you...</i>

21:42.070 --> 21:43.196
All right, guys.

21:43.371 --> 21:44.998
<i>To the Casa de las Palmas...</i>

21:45.306 --> 21:47.501
<i>our oasis of palms
in the south of Spain.</i>

21:47.675 --> 21:50.041
- Does somebody live here?
- Yeah, in the summertime.

21:50.211 --> 21:55.843
<i>I hope everyone is having
a wonderful day...</i>

21:56.518 --> 22:02.218
<i>and taking time from your hectic lives
to relax with friends and family...</i>

22:02.524 --> 22:07.018
<i>whether it is enjoying the
flowers in our bountiful gardens...</i>

22:07.295 --> 22:12.028
<i>or sampling the myriad delicacies...</i>

22:12.233 --> 22:16.294
<i>prepared by chefs from
our prosperous home.</i>

22:17.338 --> 22:20.637
Please eat and socialize...

22:21.209 --> 22:25.839
and enjoy your time with us.

22:30.552 --> 22:34.215
I am happy to welcome the Chinese
to my country.

22:35.256 --> 22:38.783
My father welcomes the Chinese
to our country.

22:40.028 --> 22:41.757
Of course.

22:44.132 --> 22:45.724
Please.

22:46.534 --> 22:48.126
Right there.

22:51.472 --> 22:53.099
Thank you.

22:56.477 --> 23:00.072
Arabs are very family-oriented,
as a people.

23:01.215 --> 23:03.149
Is that racist?

23:03.318 --> 23:04.876
Sure.

23:05.053 --> 23:07.521
- It is?
- A little.

23:07.822 --> 23:11.019
Well, no. I mean, I guess
if what you're saying is positive.

23:14.996 --> 23:17.055
You have to go in.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.324
Don't.

23:21.803 --> 23:25.466
Let him work it out on his own.
It's important for his autonomy.

23:32.313 --> 23:34.577
All right!

23:50.131 --> 23:51.428
An announcement.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.098
If man is made in God's image...

23:55.269 --> 23:59.137
then God is deeply messed up.

24:07.949 --> 24:09.314
You afraid?

24:09.550 --> 24:10.550
Afraid of the buzz?

24:10.718 --> 24:12.185
I'm afraid of your breath.

24:12.353 --> 24:15.322
Hakim hasn't had any.
And he wears jewelry.

24:15.490 --> 24:20.450
He thinks that little bracelet's gonna
get him girls.

24:20.862 --> 24:22.090
Hakim!

24:22.263 --> 24:24.823
<i>Hakim! Hakim! Hakim!</i>

24:28.202 --> 24:30.534
I want to talk to your uncle about work.

24:30.705 --> 24:32.764
There isn't any work.

24:33.074 --> 24:34.132
Farooq!

24:34.308 --> 24:35.434
You said you'd introduce me.

24:35.710 --> 24:36.938
Don't be such a pest.

24:37.245 --> 24:39.440
Hakim! Hakim!

24:39.614 --> 24:41.878
Are you here to see the emir?

24:42.050 --> 24:43.574
Yeah.

24:44.452 --> 24:46.079
Me too.

24:48.790 --> 24:50.382
What do you do?

24:51.592 --> 24:56.359
I'm a partner in
a derivatives-trading company in Geneva.

24:56.964 --> 24:58.989
- Energy?
- Yeah.

24:59.167 --> 25:00.566
Right.

25:00.735 --> 25:02.168
- Bryan Woodman?
- Yes.

25:02.336 --> 25:03.735
- Good evening.
- Hi.

25:04.172 --> 25:05.969
Hi, Bryan Woodman.

25:06.140 --> 25:09.041
We regret that His Highness
will be unable to see you.

25:09.210 --> 25:13.078
However, we are authorized
to hear your proposition on his behalf.

25:13.448 --> 25:15.313
Oh, okay.

25:17.885 --> 25:20.513
What, here? Now?

25:24.158 --> 25:26.752
Okay. Well....

25:28.062 --> 25:31.896
Okay. Our position is that
the real worry for you guys...

25:32.066 --> 25:34.534
is another year of record pricing.

25:34.702 --> 25:39.139
There are no more elephant fields,
not even in natural gas...

25:39.307 --> 25:42.208
and as structural alternatives
become more fully realized...

25:42.376 --> 25:46.813
you'll need new strategies to maximize
every penny of your existing resources...

25:46.981 --> 25:49.973
particularly in a climate
of falling prices.

25:50.151 --> 25:54.850
And that's what, you know, our firm is
prepared to help problem-solve with you...

25:55.022 --> 25:57.820
the, you know, foreseeable...

25:57.992 --> 26:01.928
and unforeseeable problems
you encounter.

26:05.566 --> 26:07.659
This house is a Genius-Home.

26:07.902 --> 26:10.598
One of my sons had it wired by experts
from the United States.

26:10.872 --> 26:11.872
Watch.

26:20.248 --> 26:23.012
Your Highness, that is incredible.

26:24.085 --> 26:27.919
Prince Nasir, isn't that amazing?

26:29.423 --> 26:30.617
Fascinating.

26:31.759 --> 26:34.387
The Chinese take the trouble
to learn Arabic.

26:34.662 --> 26:36.289
Look, it's getting dark.

26:36.497 --> 26:38.692
Better turn on the pool lights.

26:47.408 --> 26:50.241
Send a fool on a fool's errand.

26:50.645 --> 26:54.274
Moussa, come fix this remote control!

27:17.471 --> 27:19.632
Are you not talking?

27:21.475 --> 27:24.035
Come on, sweetheart.
Just a little bit, okay?

27:24.212 --> 27:27.443
You're the shark, and you try
to tag us as we swim across.

27:27.615 --> 27:29.879
All right? You jump in,
count "one, two, three"...

27:30.051 --> 27:31.916
then we try to get to the other side.

27:32.086 --> 27:34.577
- All right? Okay.
- Okay. Come on.

27:34.789 --> 27:36.723
Come on, go. Go.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.427
Yeah. Okay.

27:44.498 --> 27:46.159
- Come on, jump in.
- Come on.

27:46.334 --> 27:48.734
- Come on. Jump in!
- Sissy!

27:49.270 --> 27:51.397
Just jump, come on!

28:02.316 --> 28:03.840
Max?

28:04.018 --> 28:05.849
- Max!
- Oh, my God!

28:08.256 --> 28:10.224
Cut the power! Cut the power!

28:11.025 --> 28:12.788
Max! Max!

28:12.960 --> 28:14.894
- Let go!
- Somebody cut the power!

28:19.400 --> 28:22.062
- Max!
- Come on. Come on.

28:22.236 --> 28:24.329
- That's my son!
- Oh, my God.

28:24.505 --> 28:25.870
- Get out of my way!
- Okay.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.371
- Oh, my God!
- Take him!

28:27.541 --> 28:31.443
Take him! Take him out.
Take him this way. Take him out.

28:31.913 --> 28:33.574
Put him down. Down, down.

28:34.348 --> 28:36.908
- Sweetie?
- Someone get a doctor, doctor, doctor!

28:37.084 --> 28:38.949
He's not breathing. He's not breathing.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.179
- Get a doctor!
- Is anybody a doctor?

28:41.622 --> 28:44.056
Do something! Help us!

28:50.164 --> 28:54.362
<i>I hear phrases thrown around like
"the corrupting influence of money"...</i>

28:54.535 --> 28:55.763
Washington, DC

28:55.937 --> 28:59.338
<i>or "the evil influence
of dollars in politics "...</i>

28:59.507 --> 29:02.340
<i>when more money was spent
on the syndication rights...</i>

<i>Last election cycle,
I spent $300,000.</i>

29:12.820 --> 29:16.278
<i>I have pictures of myself with the
president that I use all over the world.</i>

29:16.457 --> 29:18.049
I didn't make this coffee for you.

29:18.225 --> 29:22.093
<i>People don't know Danny Dalton, but they
know the president of the United States...</i>

29:22.263 --> 29:25.630
<i>and they see that I know
the president of the United States.</i>

29:25.800 --> 29:27.597
<i>- In a free society...
- Making it for me.</i>

29:27.768 --> 29:29.429
<i>The one written into law...</i>

29:29.603 --> 29:31.230
You...

29:31.405 --> 29:34.203

- I'm making oatmeal.</i>

29:34.375 --> 29:36.809
<i>- And organized into committees...
- Then you sleep.</i>

29:36.978 --> 29:39.378
<i>Not the U.S. government,
who decide the issues....</i>

29:39.547 --> 29:40.912
You look like shit.

29:41.082 --> 29:43.175
<i>Of a political campaign.</i>

29:43.351 --> 29:45.683
<i>In our country, we don't...</i>

29:46.187 --> 29:49.156
<i>stuff dollars into ballot boxes.</i>

29:49.323 --> 29:50.585
<i>- What we do...
- You working?</i>

29:50.758 --> 29:53.318
<i>- Is turn money into votes.

29:53.494 --> 29:54.927
<i>The ability of a candidate....</i>

29:55.096 --> 29:57.724
There's beer in my fridge,
so you don't die of the DTs.

29:57.898 --> 29:59.331
Please don't smoke in my house.

29:59.500 --> 30:05.632
<i>- -meaning, not so loosely translated,

30:06.173 --> 30:12.544
<i>And, last time I heard, speech in

30:13.214 --> 30:17.480
<i>You can't limit my advocacy

30:19.086 --> 30:25.150
<i>I have a sovereign, inalienable right

30:25.760 --> 30:29.127
<i>And why is it some dirty little secret...</i>

30:29.296 --> 30:35.098
that it's in America's interest
to do business overseas?

31:01.495 --> 31:04.987
Two of my wife's kids were deported
from this country.

31:05.166 --> 31:07.225
You know why?
Because they didn't have work.

31:07.401 --> 31:08.868
You don't have to pay me.

31:09.036 --> 31:12.005
Give me something to do.

31:12.673 --> 31:14.300
Then decide.

31:15.776 --> 31:20.679
I'm sorry. I already have a
long list for that job too.

31:20.848 --> 31:24.079
And if you want to work in this country...

31:24.251 --> 31:25.616
learn the language.

31:25.786 --> 31:28.050
Learn Arabic!

31:32.760 --> 31:36.526
Foreign workers' compound
The Persian Gulf

31:43.938 --> 31:45.530
Why are they running?

31:46.740 --> 31:48.731
Maybe the small one...

31:49.577 --> 31:52.910
committed a crime or something.

31:57.251 --> 32:00.516
They gave us french fries
at the Islamic school.

32:05.259 --> 32:07.523
Close the door, Papa.

32:08.762 --> 32:11.356
His sister has a thing for you.

32:11.732 --> 32:14.166
His sister has a big ass.

32:14.401 --> 32:17.564
Of course, at the Islamic school you
don't have to worry about that.

32:17.738 --> 32:20.707
And lamb. We got skewers of lamb.

32:21.342 --> 32:23.139
I like lamb.

32:29.984 --> 32:34.444
<i>Have your identification card ready.
No talking in line.</i>

32:36.590 --> 32:41.892
<i>Have your identification card ready.
No talking in line.</i>

32:44.298 --> 32:46.630
I can't remember it this hot.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.360
Old man, you don't want to talk here.

32:49.537 --> 32:50.537
Stop talking.

32:53.474 --> 32:55.442
Tough guy.
What's your name?

32:55.943 --> 32:56.943
What's your name?!

32:57.111 --> 32:58.510
Johnny.

34:17.591 --> 34:19.581
Mommy!

34:25.331 --> 34:27.266
Mommy!

34:29.270 --> 34:31.329
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Mommy.

34:32.106 --> 34:34.438
Come here, bear. Come here.

34:34.608 --> 34:35.905
You okay?

34:36.076 --> 34:38.567
I wanna look out the window.

34:38.746 --> 34:42.112
You wanna look out the window?
Come on.

34:47.221 --> 34:49.451
I spy a bird.

35:00.267 --> 35:04.363
<i>Well, if on Monday,
Iran refuses the IAEA inspectors...</i>

35:04.538 --> 35:06.972
<i>you can look to crude prices
to spike yet again.</i>

35:11.245 --> 35:15.944
Right. Well, it's not exactly a secret
that Iran will refuse snap inspections.

35:18.018 --> 35:20.384
Okay, Rebecca. Thank you.

35:23.490 --> 35:25.082
Go home.

35:26.627 --> 35:29.323
It was a stupid fucking question, Henry.

35:31.432 --> 35:33.593
The prince's man called again.

35:35.235 --> 35:36.998
I'm just telling him.

35:46.146 --> 35:49.013
U.S. Department of Justice
Washington, DC

35:50.584 --> 35:52.552
Hey, how bad is it?

35:54.221 --> 35:56.280
When a Volvo dealer says that....

35:56.457 --> 35:59.392
Okay. You're honorable, decent guys.

35:59.560 --> 36:00.925
Right.

36:01.495 --> 36:04.089
My wife and our narrow driveway....

36:04.264 --> 36:06.892
- How the hell are you?
- Well, you know, can't complain.

36:07.067 --> 36:10.298
That's not good, kiddo.
That's suffering quietly.

36:10.471 --> 36:12.496
Married? Kids?

36:14.942 --> 36:17.376
There is no way a company like Killen...

36:17.544 --> 36:20.274
pulled off a deal like this
without paying somebody off.

36:20.681 --> 36:23.241
Why don't you tell me what you have
so I can respond.

36:24.518 --> 36:27.078
I used to think there was
something wrong here.

36:27.254 --> 36:29.654
Now I know there's
something wrong here.

36:33.761 --> 36:37.026
Either you don't find anything,
because you don't know how to look...

36:37.197 --> 36:41.930
or you do and they carve you out
and light you on fire.

36:42.369 --> 36:44.997
That's gotta be the play here, right?

36:46.840 --> 36:48.967
Bennett Holiday.

36:50.277 --> 36:51.744
Sydney Hewitt's new boy.

36:52.146 --> 36:54.046
How many of those have I seen?

36:54.214 --> 36:56.580
Six? Seven?

36:57.584 --> 36:59.245
They're all gone.

36:59.420 --> 37:01.980
He's still Sydney-fucking-Hewitt.

37:04.324 --> 37:05.848
Fourteen-11.

37:06.026 --> 37:07.584
Match point.

37:08.228 --> 37:10.753
I think they've got someone
inside the deal.

37:10.931 --> 37:12.193
Someone they can squeeze.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.898
You mean like an informant?

37:16.069 --> 37:20.096
Yes, sir, like an informant. Just my
opinion, based on their overconfidence.

37:20.274 --> 37:22.105
Match point.

37:31.018 --> 37:32.485
Thank you.

37:35.022 --> 37:38.150
You know, if people in oil deals...

37:38.325 --> 37:41.886
talked to U.S. Attorneys,
there'd be no oil business. Dean.

37:42.062 --> 37:45.998
Bennett Holiday, you know Dean Whiting,
founding partner of our firm.

37:46.166 --> 37:48.191
- Good to see you, sir.
- How are you?

37:48.368 --> 37:50.962
We've been discussing
the Connex-Killen merger situation.

37:51.138 --> 37:54.266
Will they get approval?
Hell of a large company if they do.

37:54.441 --> 37:55.965
I mean, client.

37:56.410 --> 37:59.072
Well, the Tengiz field,
Killen's largest asset...

37:59.246 --> 38:03.012
is being looked into pretty heavily
by the U.S. Attorney's office.

38:03.183 --> 38:05.174
Well, Bennett, as they say in the Bible:

38:05.352 --> 38:08.685
"There are many, many ways
to light Europe."

38:25.038 --> 38:30.203
<i>Yeah, well, there's an arrow on the ceiling
pointing towards Mecca.</i>

38:31.245 --> 38:33.645
The Binladin Group
air-conditioned Mecca.

38:33.814 --> 38:37.341
It was a huge project.
They made billions and billions.

38:40.187 --> 38:43.918
<i>All the women are dressed in black
from head to toe...</i>

38:44.091 --> 38:46.525
<i>walking 5 feet behind the men.</i>

38:48.962 --> 38:52.125
<i>It's 125.</i>

38:52.299 --> 38:55.097
<i>Literally, 125 and humid.</i>

38:55.269 --> 38:59.262
<i>When I walked out of the airport,
it was like a wall fell on me.</i>

39:00.874 --> 39:03.308
<i>The men are all wearing white sheets.</i>

39:03.477 --> 39:07.846
<i>And they're spotless white sheets.
I don't really understand that.</i>

39:08.448 --> 39:09.938
<i>They kind of say:</i>

39:10.617 --> 39:13.347
<i>"It's hot and I don't have to work. "</i>

39:13.520 --> 39:15.920
<i>I don't understand how
you could do anything in that.</i>

39:16.089 --> 39:18.455
<i>I'd like to see these guys play baseball.</i>

39:23.230 --> 39:25.130
Are you okay?

39:26.366 --> 39:28.163
<i>You sound strange.</i>

39:28.335 --> 39:30.200
No, I'm fine.

39:53.093 --> 39:55.323
They will try to disguise the difference...

39:55.562 --> 39:58.929
to make Muslims who speak
about religion...

39:59.199 --> 40:02.191
appear to be fanatics
or backward people.

40:02.369 --> 40:06.635
They will tell us the dispute is over
economic resources...

40:07.107 --> 40:08.768
or military domination.

40:09.042 --> 40:12.739
If we believe that,
we play right into their hands...

40:13.413 --> 40:17.281
with only ourselves to blame.

40:17.784 --> 40:19.251
It is not possible...

40:19.453 --> 40:22.251
to bridge the divide
between human nature...

40:22.656 --> 40:25.420
and modern life through free trade.

40:25.592 --> 40:26.684
Impossible.

40:27.127 --> 40:31.689
The divine and the worldly
are but a single concept.

40:32.432 --> 40:33.922
The Koran.

40:34.468 --> 40:39.030
No separation of religion and state.

40:40.273 --> 40:41.570
The Koran.

40:42.576 --> 40:45.739
Instead of kings legislating
and slaves obeying...

40:46.613 --> 40:48.240
the Koran.

40:49.082 --> 40:52.051
The pain of modern life
cannot be cured by...

40:52.252 --> 40:53.981
deregulation...

40:54.154 --> 40:55.485
privatization...

40:55.822 --> 40:56.880
economic reform...

40:57.324 --> 40:58.757
or lower taxes.

40:59.860 --> 41:03.387
The pain of living in the modern world...

41:03.630 --> 41:06.064
will never be solved
by a liberal society.

41:09.269 --> 41:11.863
Liberal societies have failed.

41:12.305 --> 41:14.466
Christian theology has failed.

41:14.975 --> 41:16.840
The West has failed.

41:20.247 --> 41:23.182
This was a birthday and graduation present
a couple years ago.

41:23.350 --> 41:24.578
Cap d'Antibes, France

41:24.751 --> 41:27.515
What happened was,
I was about to graduate from Oxford...

41:27.688 --> 41:32.057
and my mother had a horse
in the Royal Ascot race, right?

41:32.225 --> 41:34.420
The horse won...

41:34.594 --> 41:38.052
that same day that I was graduating.
And my trust fund matured.

41:38.565 --> 41:42.558
So that tops any birthday present that
any of you have bought for me tonight.

41:46.306 --> 41:50.208
Capitalism cannot exist without waste.

41:50.377 --> 41:53.904
We should write thank-you notes
to Mr. Whiting and the U.S.A...

41:54.081 --> 41:56.743
for producing one-quarter
of the world's garbage...

41:56.917 --> 41:59.112
and one-quarter of the demand.

41:59.486 --> 42:01.317
You're certainly welcome.

42:01.488 --> 42:03.217
Our pleasure, really.

42:06.626 --> 42:08.355
Prince...

42:09.463 --> 42:13.160
is there anything
that we can do for you?

42:13.934 --> 42:18.064
Americans are always happy to drill holes
in other people's countries.

42:18.238 --> 42:23.437
I've heard of you, Mr. Whiting.
The cat's-paw of the Saudi princes.

42:26.513 --> 42:30.313
I know your brother, the foreign minister.
He's very bright.

42:30.484 --> 42:31.746
I know your father too.

42:32.319 --> 42:35.914
He threw the second creepiest party
I've ever been to in Washington.

42:36.590 --> 42:38.558
And as far as I can see...

42:39.192 --> 42:43.253
you could probably use
a bit of the cat's-paw yourself.

42:43.697 --> 42:47.599
Second-born son,
so beaten down by his family...

42:47.768 --> 42:51.568
he can't even tell me what he wants
when he's asked straight-out.

42:51.738 --> 42:55.902
A grown-up baby
who's afraid of his brother...

42:57.344 --> 43:00.313
and maybe wants to be king?

43:00.981 --> 43:02.676
Maybe?

43:03.917 --> 43:06.283
Well, prince...

43:07.087 --> 43:09.282
are you a king?

43:09.856 --> 43:12.552
Can you tell me what you want?

43:18.064 --> 43:19.497
<i>All right, what's next?</i>

43:19.666 --> 43:21.861
<i>The lethal finding on Nasir came through.</i>

43:22.035 --> 43:24.503
<i>That was quick. You have a timetable?</i>

43:24.671 --> 43:27.504
<i>He'll be in Beirut next week.
We could do it there.</i>

43:27.674 --> 43:30.006
<i>That's good. Anybody around?</i>

43:30.177 --> 43:32.873
<i>Actually, yes.
I made contact with Mussawi.</i>

43:33.046 --> 43:35.310
<i>He'd be happy to work
with whoever we send.</i>

43:36.817 --> 43:39.411
I was thinking it would be good for Bob.

43:43.223 --> 43:45.851
I'll let you have him
without going through Terry...

43:46.026 --> 43:49.052
but everything better go exactly right.

43:49.229 --> 43:51.823
And tell him, "Easy on the memos."

43:51.998 --> 43:56.094
This is the prototype
of an oil-rich Arab monarchy.

43:56.269 --> 44:00.706
Since prevailing in the tribal conflicts
of the 1920s...

44:00.874 --> 44:04.640
the Al-Subaai family have ruled
their kingdom effectively...

44:04.811 --> 44:07.371
and, by most accounts, benignly.

44:07.547 --> 44:11.745
However, they face enormous challenges
in the future.

44:11.918 --> 44:14.978
The fact of the matter is that
at current levels of production....

44:15.155 --> 44:17.123
- Welcome, Bob.
- Hi.

44:17.290 --> 44:20.919
Good news. I think we've got something
for you, something you'll like...

44:21.094 --> 44:25.394
that utilizes your specific skill set.

44:26.266 --> 44:28.200
You know this guy?

44:29.402 --> 44:32.838
- Prince Nasir Al-Subaai.
- His money's in a lot of dark corners...

44:33.006 --> 44:36.407
paying for weapons
that could be used against the U.S.A.

44:38.879 --> 44:40.938
Paperwork on polygraphs.

44:41.114 --> 44:42.843
Wire transfers to Qaeda fronts.

44:43.016 --> 44:46.975
Letters instructing his water ministry
to employ Mohammed Sheik Agiza...

44:47.153 --> 44:48.882
the guy who has your missile.

44:49.055 --> 44:51.649
He's traveling to Beirut.
You have experience in Beirut.

44:51.825 --> 44:53.588
It's a great city.

44:54.394 --> 44:56.225
This is a bad guy.

44:56.596 --> 44:59.895
And, who knows, maybe you'll find
your blue-eyed Egyptian.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.667
- I sent you a report on...
- Sorry, I gotta get going.

45:03.837 --> 45:05.964
My daughter's got a soccer game.

45:06.139 --> 45:07.697
Big one.

45:08.575 --> 45:11.772
Did you see my missile report?
I reset the guidance to blow 10 feet...

45:11.945 --> 45:13.173
Bob, you just don't get it.

45:13.914 --> 45:17.782
Nobody wants to hear about
a missing missile, not right now.

45:17.951 --> 45:20.613
This is top of the director's list.

45:20.887 --> 45:23.151
Hit a walk-off home run...

45:23.690 --> 45:25.180
you get any desk you want.

45:25.358 --> 45:30.318
Sheik Hamad has not yet made
a decision about who will succeed him.

45:30.497 --> 45:33.864
In our view, Prince Nasir...

45:34.034 --> 45:37.765
is likely the more ambitious
of the two brothers.

45:37.938 --> 45:39.667
This, however, does not mean...

45:39.839 --> 45:44.367
that he will prevail
in any succession struggle.

46:07.434 --> 46:11.871
Your generosity is bigger than a mountain
that shades us from the burning sun.

46:12.405 --> 46:15.238
My house has grown too small
for my family.

46:15.408 --> 46:19.242
If we had more land...

46:19.412 --> 46:22.040
then my son could build his own house.

46:47.040 --> 46:50.498
My father has ordered
the Marbella estate to be razed.

46:53.947 --> 46:56.006
There'll be a park.

46:57.884 --> 47:00.512
We're so sorry for your loss.

47:14.701 --> 47:17.192
Six more North Field blocks
are being developed.

47:17.771 --> 47:20.569
We'd like to offer your firm the rights.

47:22.308 --> 47:24.071
Six blocks?

47:24.244 --> 47:27.008
- Which phase?
- Third phase.

47:28.648 --> 47:31.515
Okay, so we'd be
in the stream for...

47:31.684 --> 47:34.152
10 one-hundredths of a cent.

47:35.388 --> 47:37.618
So $ 75 million.

47:37.791 --> 47:39.554
Seventy... Great. That's great.

47:39.726 --> 47:41.751
How much for my other kid?

47:48.735 --> 47:51.795
You know, if I were your economic adviser,
I'd tell you that...

47:51.971 --> 47:54.804
that's not the stupidest thing,
financially, you've done...

47:54.974 --> 47:58.740
but probably just the dumbest thing
you'll do today. Probably.

47:58.912 --> 48:00.880
But why would you need
an economic adviser?

48:01.047 --> 48:03.208
Years ago, you had
the highest GNP in the world.

48:03.383 --> 48:06.318
Today, you're tied with Albania.
So good work.

48:06.486 --> 48:09.080
Your second biggest export
is secondhand goods...

48:09.255 --> 48:12.622
followed closely by dates,
for which you lose 5 cents a pound.

48:12.792 --> 48:14.919
You know what the business world
thinks of you?

48:15.095 --> 48:18.963
We think 100 years ago, you were living in
tents, chopping each other's heads off...

48:19.132 --> 48:21.532
and that's exactly where you'll be
in another 100.

48:21.701 --> 48:24.636
So, yes, on behalf of my firm,
I accept your money. Thank you.

48:24.804 --> 48:27.796
Fine. I'll have the funds
transferred to your firm immediately.

48:27.974 --> 48:29.305
Great.

48:29.476 --> 48:31.774
And I'll give you 100 million
for the other kid.

48:35.648 --> 48:38.082
So now you're my economic adviser...

48:38.251 --> 48:41.709
why don't you tell me something
I don't already know.

48:46.359 --> 48:48.554
All right. You want an idea?
Here's an idea.

48:50.430 --> 48:52.489
There's the Eurasian triangle.

48:52.665 --> 48:56.226
Your kingdom is here. Iran is there.
You've been selling your oil...

48:56.402 --> 49:02.204
sticking it on ships and watching
as it sails away around Africa to there.

49:02.375 --> 49:05.674
Pretend for a second that
this is excess Iranian pipeline capacity.

49:05.845 --> 49:08.973
That's your route. Right there.
Overland, through Iran.

49:09.149 --> 49:11.674
Hook up with these pipes.
Commoditize it, control it...

49:11.851 --> 49:14.251
take it to the doorstep
of every home in Europe.

49:14.420 --> 49:18.220
I just doubled your profit.
I think that's a pretty good idea.

49:20.927 --> 49:24.761
777 Ranch Hondo, Texas

49:35.108 --> 49:38.441
My granddaddy was a wildcatter.
Same with my daddy.

49:38.611 --> 49:41.011
That's how I got my start.

49:41.514 --> 49:43.539
Luck and hard work.

49:43.716 --> 49:45.616
Nobody handed me shit.

49:46.119 --> 49:47.746
Now I got...

49:47.921 --> 49:51.516
libraries and parks named after me.

49:51.958 --> 49:56.190
And I'll probably ruin my grandkids.

49:59.999 --> 50:01.762
You wearing a wire, Bennett?

50:02.902 --> 50:04.392
No.

50:16.015 --> 50:17.949
Mr. Janus...

50:18.384 --> 50:20.511
chairman of Connex...

50:21.454 --> 50:24.480
and Dean Whiting,
founding partner of your firm...

50:24.958 --> 50:28.689
are proud members of
the Committee to Liberate Iran.

50:28.861 --> 50:31.421
Danny D. here is too.

50:31.598 --> 50:33.759
D is for "Dalton."

50:33.933 --> 50:37.699
- I was on the other side of the Tengiz deal.
- "The other side"?

50:37.870 --> 50:41.601
<i>El Presidente Nazarbayev's best pal
in the whole world.</i>

50:41.774 --> 50:44.334
She's a beautiful field, the Tengiz.

50:45.011 --> 50:48.811
Goddamn, is she a beautiful field.

50:54.020 --> 50:55.248
What is it? "Irish...."

50:55.421 --> 50:56.649
Rockville, Maryland

50:56.823 --> 51:00.054
"The Irish pray on their knees,
the Scots prey on their neighbors."

51:02.695 --> 51:04.663
How's Margaret?

51:04.831 --> 51:06.856
You guys divorced yet?

51:07.033 --> 51:10.161
- We're not getting divorced.
- I don't think, in our line of work...

51:10.336 --> 51:14.898
there's two people with your security
clearances who have made a marriage work.

51:15.074 --> 51:16.974
I'm telling you, Bobby, my boy...

51:17.143 --> 51:19.407
number three. That's the charm.

51:19.579 --> 51:21.877
- That's the number, huh?
- Yeah.

51:23.516 --> 51:25.541
I like consulting.

51:25.718 --> 51:27.709
No, I love it.

51:28.021 --> 51:30.148
Love it. And I'll say this for it:

51:30.323 --> 51:33.315
Private business is efficient.

51:33.726 --> 51:35.489
There, I've said it. Fucking cliché.

51:35.662 --> 51:39.428
And the CIA is, like, what,
a 30-billion-a-year business...

51:39.599 --> 51:42.591
so anybody who wants to sell anything,
a pencil, a computer...

51:42.769 --> 51:46.830
they gotta interface through
a security clearance. Don't give me shit.

51:47.006 --> 51:51.102
I got two kids in college,
and we're doing our kitchen.

51:52.679 --> 51:55.011
Stan, I got a chance to go back to Beirut.

51:55.381 --> 51:57.212
I wanna go back.

51:57.750 --> 51:59.513
Is it safe for me?

52:02.822 --> 52:05.655
Are we talking about with your wife
or with the wackos?

52:13.533 --> 52:15.626
Clear it with Hezbollah.

52:25.878 --> 52:30.178
Hezbollah-controlled suburb
Beirut, Lebanon

53:09.789 --> 53:11.654
Said Hashimi. Said Hashimi.

53:11.824 --> 53:13.416
Said Hashimi.

53:13.593 --> 53:16.221
I'm Canadian. It's okay. Canadian.

53:16.562 --> 53:17.790
Said Hashimi.

53:17.964 --> 53:21.923
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

53:22.769 --> 53:23.997
It's okay.

54:22.261 --> 54:26.129
I have a good feeling
about American people, Bob.

54:26.566 --> 54:28.227
A good people.

54:28.601 --> 54:32.503
There are 10 million Muslims
in the U.S.

54:35.641 --> 54:37.700
Thank you for this audience.

54:37.910 --> 54:41.471
I have a business proposal for Mussawi,
one that benefits everyone.

54:42.014 --> 54:44.778
Mussawi is an energetic young man.

54:45.184 --> 54:47.982
Your Arabic is very good.

54:49.422 --> 54:53.756
I thought it would be prudent to say that
I have no interest in Hezbollah.

54:53.993 --> 54:56.587
This is business
and it doesn't concern Hezbollah.

55:05.438 --> 55:08.168
If what you say is true...

55:08.941 --> 55:11.535
consider yourself welcome in Lebanon.

55:11.878 --> 55:16.281
They can lift 10 times their weight,
and jump 20 times their height.

55:16.449 --> 55:18.280
But I still don't understand....

55:18.551 --> 55:21.748
The spider is a symbol
of the sin of man.

55:22.154 --> 55:24.952
He bites the finger of Peter Parker...

55:25.124 --> 55:27.820
who is now half dark and half light.

55:29.028 --> 55:34.398
A real spider captures, stings
and immobilizes...

55:35.034 --> 55:39.767
then watches
as the prey takes days to die.

55:41.507 --> 55:43.998
They'd never show that.

55:51.484 --> 55:52.484
Are we in trouble?

55:52.652 --> 55:53.949
Peace be upon you, boys.

55:54.854 --> 55:56.116
No, it's not a problem.

55:58.090 --> 55:59.090
Look around you...

55:59.759 --> 56:05.595
at your brothers united by faith in God
and submission to his law.

56:12.405 --> 56:14.930
We're all brothers.

56:15.107 --> 56:16.734
We're one family.

56:18.010 --> 56:19.204
Wasim is still a virgin.

56:20.746 --> 56:21.770
That is good.

56:22.582 --> 56:24.447
Fornication is a serious crime.

56:27.620 --> 56:28.644
I'm a virgin too.

56:29.255 --> 56:30.586
That is good as well.

56:31.557 --> 56:33.184
"Abstain from sex out of wedlock.

56:33.426 --> 56:35.087
It is an attack on honor...

56:35.261 --> 56:36.728
and shows contempt for sanctity."

56:36.896 --> 56:38.523
God has spoken the truth.

56:40.933 --> 56:43.595
Let us pray together.

57:13.383 --> 57:16.477
Rumors of Bob, but never Bob.

57:17.553 --> 57:19.714
It is "Bob," right?

57:21.824 --> 57:24.122
What is it you tell people
you do these days, Bob?

57:24.293 --> 57:27.319
Between State Department and Defense.

57:32.735 --> 57:34.862
It's just me, buddy.

57:35.038 --> 57:37.097
As requested.

57:39.208 --> 57:42.006
I'm gonna get
some information out, Jimmy.

57:43.880 --> 57:47.008
- My name is Mussawi.
- Okay, Jimmy.

57:55.158 --> 57:57.388
He's traveling in Beirut.

57:57.894 --> 58:00.590
It's dangerous to travel. He'll disappear.

58:05.768 --> 58:09.101
Take him from his hotel, drug him,
put him in the front of a car...

58:09.272 --> 58:12.332
and run a truck into him
at 50 miles an hour.

58:17.747 --> 58:20.875
It's good to have you back in town, Bob.

58:45.708 --> 58:48.939
<i>We begin the process of empowering
a new generation of Arabs....</i>

58:49.612 --> 58:51.546
Beirut.

58:51.714 --> 58:55.081
No, no. He invited me
to come with him.

58:55.651 --> 58:58.518
I think he thinks he's some kind
of reformer or something.

58:59.489 --> 59:01.980
Anyway, he's got a nice private plane.

59:04.160 --> 59:06.185
Hold on, Vincent.

59:10.533 --> 59:12.296
Hey.

59:12.702 --> 59:15.603
Beirut? It's great. It's like the....

59:15.772 --> 59:18.935
It's like the Paris of the Middle East.

59:19.108 --> 59:21.406
Yeah, it's like... It's
like winning the NIT.

59:21.577 --> 59:25.206
<i>- -however, unlike Washington's
Greater Middle East Initiative...</i>

59:25.381 --> 59:27.372
It's a bad... Just never mind, never mind.

59:27.750 --> 59:31.709
<i>We respect each country's right
to move at its own pace.</i>

01:00:12.228 --> 01:00:13.752
Make room.

01:00:19.969 --> 01:00:21.869
American?

01:00:22.705 --> 01:00:24.434
Canadian.

01:00:24.607 --> 01:00:27.201
Don't see many Occidentals these days.

01:00:39.355 --> 01:00:41.289
It's too bad.

01:02:55.266 --> 01:02:56.893
Go, go, go.

01:03:40.745 --> 01:03:43.771
- This is November, '94.
- Yeah. Excellent, excellent.

01:03:43.948 --> 01:03:46.746
- Did you find the others?
- I couldn't. Joe's looking for it.

01:03:46.918 --> 01:03:49.478
- He'll bring it out when he does.
- Where is he?

01:03:49.654 --> 01:03:51.849
He's back there looking.
He'll bring them out.

01:03:52.023 --> 01:03:53.820
Okay. Thank you, Susan.

01:04:02.767 --> 01:04:04.234
Hello?

01:04:04.402 --> 01:04:06.131
Yeah.

01:04:06.304 --> 01:04:07.931
Who's this?

01:04:12.844 --> 01:04:15.369
Yeah. Okay.

01:04:20.752 --> 01:04:22.447
How you doing, sir?

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.747
Somebody called me.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.520
If you find me, call my son
Bennett junior at this number.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.820
Bob.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.620
What do you know about
torture methods...

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.420
used by the Chinese
on the Falun Gong?

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.720
Method number one.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.220
What's your guess?

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.920
Water dungeon.

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:09.420
Did you guess water dungeon?

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.620
Number two method?

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.020
Number two, twisting arm
and putting face in feces.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.220
Not interested in two.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.320
Number three.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.220
Number three is called...

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.820
"pulling nails from fingers."

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.520
What do you think, Bob?

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.520
Number three sound good to you?

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:48.220
The purpose is to get the monks
or whatever...

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.020
to recant their beliefs.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.120
What if I had to get you to recant?

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.320
That'd be pretty difficult, right?

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.420
Because...

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:06.720
if you have no beliefs
to recant, then what?

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:13.620
Well, then, you're fucked is what.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.420
Bob.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.220
You're gonna give me the names...

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.720
of every person
that's taken money from you.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.420
Oh, that is disgusting.

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.720
Come on, Jimmy,
you're not a Koran-thumper.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.420
My name is Mussawi.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.620
You fucking fuck, fucking fuck,
stupid fuck!

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.420
What the fuck? This is a war.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.220
Fuck! You're a PO-fucking-W!
Give me the fucking names!

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:13.420
Fuck it.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:17.120
I'm cutting his fucking head off.

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.320
I'm gonna cut your head off, Bob.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.120
Said Hashimi is very angry with you,
Mussawi.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.420
Said Hashimi keeps his word.

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.420
You're a guest of Hezbollah too, Mussawi.

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:15.820
I'm going to show you
something really cool.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.120
American-made. Good quality...

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.220
but nearly impossible to hit anything.

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.319
By shaping the charge...

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.620
this will send a blast
of molten copper...

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.220
through 30 inches of steel.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.420
Careful!

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.520
It's very dangerous.

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.420
Jane.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.120
We've just received a dispatch
from Damascus, eight minutes old.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.820
Mussawi's shopping a story
that we sent Bob to Beirut...

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.220
to assassinate Prince Nasir.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.120
We better go talk to Terry.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.320
Can we get this guy?
I mean now, real-time now.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.220
- Mussawi?
- I'll call you back.

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.720
The practical answer is no.
Not before he goes into another mosque...

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.520
or a newspaper
and the story gains traction. No.

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.020
- He have Bob's name?
- Not his real name.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.920
Mussawi's shopping photos
of them doing the deal, long lens.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.620
Photos of Bob being held.
We're lucky this guy is alive.

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:43.220
The whole contact was a setup.
Mussawi now apparently works with Iran.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.820
First he tortures our guy,
then he peddles the CIA connection.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.420
Put some space between us and Bob.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.620
Bob has a long history
of entrepreneurial operations.

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.020
We haven't really had a handle
on Bob for years.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.020
After 9/11, some people got leeway,
let their emotions get the best of them.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.620
These are complex times.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:08.320
There's already an active investigation into
Bob's activities in... Help me out here.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.420
Tehran, the Amiri brothers job.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:14.320
We're finding out who hired Bob
for the Amiri brothers job.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.820
Could the same people
be behind the Nasir job?

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:19.820
A lot of people probably want
this Nasir dead...

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:22.520
and Bob knows lots of people.
Fill in the rest.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.120
Send me everything.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.220
Walter Reed Hospital
Washington, DC

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:43.720
<i>You first established contact
with the Amiri brothers in 1998?</i>

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.120
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.620
<i>- You met them at a party in France?
- Yes.</i>

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.720
<i>A party given by Reza Reyhani?</i>

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.520
<i>Reza, yes.</i>

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.920
<i>Were you aware they were
in illegal arms trade?</i>

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:56.020
<i>Of course I was aware.
That's why I went.</i>

01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:00.320
<i>Were you aware these two men
were Iranian intelligence officers?</i>

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:04.720
- What do you think?
- This is a diplomatic incident.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.420
Two men have been murdered.

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.920
We've been tasked
with the damage assessment.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.920
We'll need you to turn
your passport over to us.

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.220
Passports.

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.520
Hey.

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:27.020
Hey, I found this.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.620
Wire transfer.

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.520
In Russian. I don't speak Russian.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.020
Get it translated.

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.620
Do you speak Russian?

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.320
- These are dead.
- Oh, thanks.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.820
What are these?

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.320
Orphans. You know,
things that don't make any sense.

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.120
That one's pretty interesting.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.220
The Lily School.
It's a boarding school in Switzerland.

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.120
Paid for by wire transfer.

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:11.020
The meeting's already started.
You're not on the list.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.420
This is not an open function.
You're not wearing a badge.

01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.620
You don't have a wristband.

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.320
This is a private gathering.

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:27.820
Take this to Sydney Hewitt.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.320
<i>They are pushing
for the segregation of universities.</i>

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.820
Please.

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.320
<i>And the banning of the wearing
of colorful clothing.</i>

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:42.020
<i>But two-thirds of Iran's population
is under 30.</i>

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.420
How you doing?

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.120
<i>More than 60 percent
of university students are women.</i>

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.120
<i>And those restrictions
are like a small pebble...</i>

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.520
<i>in front of a massive tidal wave
of reform.</i>

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.320
<i>Iranian resources are abundant...</i>

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.620
<i>and given the chance,
there is no limit...</i>

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.420
<i>to what the Iranian people can achieve.</i>

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:05.320
<i>Their hopes are the same
as all people in every land...</i>

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.220
<i>to live lives of dignity
in a nation at peace.</i>

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.920
<i>And America will help them.</i>

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.520
Killen Oil, through Daniel Dalton
and Petroika Energy Consultants...

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.520
created assetless shell companies...

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.020
owned by the heirs
of Nurzan Detayev...

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.920
Republic of Kazakhstan's
minister of Domestic Resources.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.520
This was discussed
at the Upstream Division meeting...

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.620
in January, 2003 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:31.420
I was at the meeting,
but I don't focus on those details.

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.720
Wherein it was described
that Killen bore all financial risk...

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:40.220
but Minister Detayev's children, while
attending The Lily School in Switzerland...

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.420
were entitled to all of the profits.
Seventy million dollars.

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:47.120
I attended the meeting, but as I said,
I don't focus on those kind of details.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.520
Further, Daniel Dalton Jr.
And Petroika Energy Consultants colluded...

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.620
A firm retained by Killen
prior to Connex's involvement.

01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:57.020
Oh, for chrissake, Tommy.
We both got letters from the grand jury.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.920
- It's not your own private pity party.
- A good faith purchaser is in good faith...

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.420
only if they didn't know of the problems
at the time of the purchase.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.220
This is the oil business
we're talking about?

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:11.320
Lowliest little shareholder knows we deal
with the most stank places on earth.

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.420
And it is illegal to offer gifts, money...

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:17.320
the promise of money or anything
of value to influence foreign officials.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.720
Is it?

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:22.020
I have personally seen a bill
from your law firm...

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:25.920
to the government of Saudi Arabia
for $36 million.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:29.420
A one-line bill for "services rendered."

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:33.620
The business of Whiting Sloan
is not under discussion at this time.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.520
Well, it ought to be.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.520
Danny's a good man.

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.520
And he's a friend of mine.

01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.320
A Mareva injunction?

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.620
Some people, cousins of mine, actually,
sued my father in the Commonwealth...

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.020
Geneva, Switzerland

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.420
alleging he broke an agreement
to repay funds from the state.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.720
It calls them "aggrieved royals."
Aggrieved about what?

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:05.920
That he tried to cut their allowances
from 100,000 a month to 80?

01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:09.620
I want to see my father.

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:11.520
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:14.420
Your father is not feeling well.

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:33.820
My cousins aren't bright enough
to be anything but finger puppets...

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:40.820
and my brother has faith
only in his own cunning.

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:49.820
What do you suppose they're up to,
my brother and these American lawyers?

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:52.720
Tell me...

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:55.520
what are they thinking?

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.120
What are they thinking?

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.520
What are they thinking?

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.520
They're thinking that it's running out.

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.620
It's running out.

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:11.620
And 90 percent of what's left
is in the Middle East.

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:14.020
Look at the progression.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:20.520
Versailles, Suez, 1973,
Gulf War One, Gulf War Two.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.720
This is a fight to the death.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.820
So, what are they thinking? "Great."

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.920
They're thinking, "Keep playing,
keep buying yourself new toys.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.220
Keep spending $50,000 a night
on your hotel room.

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.420
But don't invest in your infrastructure.

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:36.020
Don't build a real economy."

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:40.720
So that when you finally wake up,
they will have sucked you dry...

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:44.620
and you will have squandered
the greatest natural resource in history.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:51.120
Come with me, please.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:59.020
I studied at Oxford.
I have a Ph.D. from Georgetown.

01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:00.720
I want to create a parliament.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.720
I want to give women the right to vote.

01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.820
I want an independent judiciary.

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:07.720
I want to start a petroleum exchange
in the Middle East...

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.220
cut the speculators
out of the business.

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:14.320
Why are the major oil exchanges
in London and New York anyway?

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:17.220
I'll put all of our energy
up for competitive bidding.

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:20.120
I'll run pipe through Iran to Europe,
like you proposed.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.020
I'll ship to China.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:25.120
Anything that achieves efficiency
and maximizes profit.

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:28.620
Profit which I will then use
to rebuild my country.

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:31.620
- Great, that's exactly what you should do.
- Exactly.

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:36.220
Except your president
rings my father and says:

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:42.720
"I've got unemployment in Texas,
Kansas, Washington state."

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:45.820
A phone call later, we're stealing
out of our social programs...

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.720
in order to buy overpriced airplanes.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.820
We owed the Americans,
but we've repaid that debt.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.820
I accepted a Chinese bid,
the highest bid...

01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:01.220
and suddenly I'm a terrorist.
I'm a godless communist.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.320
Dean Whiting...

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.120
who represents not only these
aggrieved royals and my brother...

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.820
but also Connex Oil...

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:19.220
they've been pressuring my father
to invalidate the Chinese contract.

01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:21.320
But they underestimate him.

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:24.920
This is about his legacy to his people.

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:27.820
I know it seems like
people sitting in hotel rooms.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.720
That's how they do business.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.020
But we're...
We're talking world historical stage here.

01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:36.720
I mean, with the... With the delivery deals
we could make in Europe...

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.220
transport through Iran.

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:42.320
This guy might be able to revolutionize
not just his country, but the whole region.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:47.320
As soon as his father keels over,
this guy could be like Mossadegh in '52...

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.620
in Iran. The real democracy
rising up organically.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.220
If we can be a part of
any of these countries...

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.720
getting a parliament,
helping them find efficiency, showing...

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.120
- You know, showing them how...
- Stop it. Stop it.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.820
Julie, the little company
that I started working for...

01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:08.520
is now chief economic adviser
to Prince Nasir.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.320
Do you understand what that means?

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.920
It's like...

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:15.320
somebody put a giant ATM
on our front lawn.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.920
Here's a question:

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.820
How do you think it looks to profit
off the death of your 6-year-old?

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.120
Fuck you.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.320
Fuck you.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.520
I changed the diapers.
I put cream on rashes.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.820
I took him to his checkups.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.820
I cared about every fucking percentile.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.520
I did everything right.
I did everything right.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.520
We're going back to the States.

01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:55.420
Good.

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.120
Riley?

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.620
Sweetie, sweetie, be careful.

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:20.820
We're gonna go now, okay?

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.420
You wanna say goodbye to your dad?

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.320
You can see him later, okay?

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.920
<i>When I die I want the people who inherit
my possessions to do the following.</i>

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.220
<i>One...</i>

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:46.420
<i>the people who prepare my body
should be good Muslims...</i>

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:51.420
<i>so this will remind me of God
and his forgiveness.</i>

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.620
<i>Two...</i>

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.920
<i>I don't want anyone to rip their clothes
or slap their faces...</i>

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.040
<i>because this is an ignorant thing to do.</i>

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.520
<i>Three...</i>

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:04.920
<i>I don't want a pregnant woman to come
and say goodbye to me...</i>

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.920
<i>because I don't approve it.</i>

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.020
<i>Four....</i>

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.420
<i>Some trust-fund prosecutor
got off message at Yale...</i>

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.720
<i>thinks he's gonna run this
up the flagpole?</i>

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.220
<i>Make a name for himself?</i>

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:22.320
<i>Maybe get elected some two-bit
congressman from nowhere...</i>

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.520
<i>with the result that China or Russia...</i>

01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.820
<i>can suddenly start having,
at our expense...</i>

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.720
<i>all the advantages we enjoy here?</i>

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.320
No, I tell you. No, sir.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:34.720
Corruption charges. Corruption?

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:37.120
Corruption is government intrusion...

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.020
into market efficiencies
in the form of regulation.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.920
That's Milton Friedman.
He got a goddamn Nobel Prize.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:47.420
We have laws against it precisely
so we can get away with it.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.320
Corruption is our protection.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.820
Corruption keeps us safe and warm!

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.820
Corruption is why you and I are
prancing around in here...

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:57.920
instead of fighting over scraps of meat
out in the street.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.320
Corruption is why we win.

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:05.620
<i>How'd it go?</i>

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:07.920
Well, he's got kids, a wife.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.520
He broke the law.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.120
Mr. Janus himself wanted me
to extend you an invitation...

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.320
to Oilman of the Year.

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.520
He's being honored...

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.020
so it should be a nice weekend.

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:26.220
Relax. Catch yourself a massage.

01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:28.520
Congratulations.

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.920
- Is Jane in?
- She's in a meeting.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.320
How about Fred?

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.320
He's in a meeting.

01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:39.620
Bennett, hey.

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:42.620
Come on, take a ride with me.

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.420
Do I have a choice, Don?

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.920
Of course you do.
This is just a courtesy call.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:54.620
I know you know about the crime-fraud
exception to attorney-client privilege.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.220
I do, Don. Very well.

01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:59.920
Then you also know your client
is into some shady stuff...

01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.720
and it's starting to look like
you could be involved...

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.120
in hiding the true nature
of the transactions.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.820
That's quite a statement, Don.

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:18.920
Dalton.

01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:22.720
Danny Dalton?

01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:26.220
Defrauded the government of Kazakhstan
of funds to which it was entitled.

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.820
Defrauded the people of Kazakhstan
of the right to the honest services...

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.120
of their elected and
appointed officials.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.820
Seven years. Does three,
maybe two and a half...

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.420
- on your recommendation.
- Now, let me guess.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.720
This was a solo act, without
the knowledge of Connex or Killen Oil...

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.520
and Mr. Lee Janus or Jimmy Pope.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.420
Dalton's a bit of a rogue, it's true.

01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:49.320
And he'll have a nice little trust fund
when he gets out.

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.720
Not so little, I imagine.

01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:57.120
Look, Don, we can spend
the next five years in court...

01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:00.620
to get back to the very place
that we're at right now.

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.920
And they will fight tough.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.520
They'll fight dirty.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.020
They'll pressure your boss...

01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:09.120
the people who appointed your boss...

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.620
the wives of the people
who appointed your boss.

01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:15.420
And you will never hit them any harder
than this, and you know it.

01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:21.020
I'm sorry, Bennett.

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.920
I don't think Dalton's enough.

01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:44.720
What are you looking at, man?

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.920
- I didn't say anything.
- That's because you have nothing to say.

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.520
You fucking asshole.

01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:31.320
There we go.

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.020
Okay, pal.

01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:37.320
Come on. Yeah, I know.
I know, I know, I know.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.320
- Hey, Fred!
- You've been such a good boy.

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.720
Fred.

01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:43.020
Hey, Bob.

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:46.720
There you go, pal.
I tell you what, Katie, take that in.

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.720
Hey, Jack. Your sister.

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.720
You first.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:58.020
Take the kids inside.
I'll be right in, okay?

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:01.620
What's going on, Fred?

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:04.920
It's okay. Be in in a sec.

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.720
FBI's got it, Bob. That's pretty clear.

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:13.820
Nothing I can do, you know it.
It's a criminal investigation.

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.520
- Two men were killed.
- I was almost killed.

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:21.220
Now they're asking me questions
about the Amiri brothers, about Tehran.

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:25.620
Understand, this wrecks careers.
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.520
I punched in "Prince Nasir Al-Subaai,"
and my computer gets seized.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.520
Where'd that job come from?
Where did the Nasir job come from?

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.720
I'm advising you to drop it.

01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:36.520
Why am I being investigated?

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.120
Why am I being investigated, Fred?

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:44.920
Goodbye, Bob.

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:51.320
It's okay. Hey, hey.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.420
What's up?

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:43.720
If I truly lack faith...

01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:47.920
then I am not the right person.

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:52.220
The questioning means
that you have faith...

01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:54.320
and makes it stronger.

01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:57.320
That's a lot of shit, I think.

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:03.520
We'll be able to intervene in the
affairs of family members.

01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:07.620
We'll be able to help them with
whatever they need.

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.720
You'll be able to get your mother here.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.520
Please.

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.320
I am tired.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:49.920
Father...

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:53.620
who will be emir?

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.620
Your brother.

01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.220
Praise be to God.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:05.820
I would ask you to remain
as foreign minister.

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:08.320
You cannot do this.

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:13.920
He is barely qualified to run a brothel,
much less a country.

01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:19.320
I like Europe.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.220
I will be happy to stay here.

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.820
My decision is final...

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:31.620
and I ask you to support your brother.

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:35.420
I cannot do that.

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:53.820
For centuries Arabs have been ruled by
people with no respect for law...

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.820
monopolies handed out for the
things that people want...

01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:02.420
commerce stifled, young people
unable to find jobs.

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:07.220
Anyone who criticizes is thrown in jail...

01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:10.220
or put to death.

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.620
And women...

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:16.720
are treated as second-class citizens.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:21.420
The coronation is tomorrow, and your
brother has the support of the Americans.

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:25.820
And 10,000 of their troops
are stationed in our country.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.120
True.

01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:35.120
My father is ill and weak, and unwilling
to oppose the Americans.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:39.720
But others are willing.

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.720
When a country has 5 percent
of the world's population...

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:48.720
but does 50 percent
of its military spending...

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:56.020
then the persuasive powers of that
country are on the decline.

01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.620
<i>They're worried.</i>

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.920
<i>About fallout. They're worried...</i>

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.020
you might wanna talk about it.

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.920
But if you're already
under investigation....

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.220
What about Mussawi?

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.820
He's a soldier.

01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:31.420
He's just like you.

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:41.120
Why are they doing a damage assessment
on the Amiris and on me for doing my job?

01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:46.320
This is about our interests in the region.

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:53.920
So if Prince Nasir won't allow
our military bases in his country...

01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:56.820
and his little brother will...

01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.620
well, we'll probably have to
do something about that.

01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:06.320
Who's worried about the Nasir job?

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:11.020
Who's worried about me talking?

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:15.720
Stan.

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.420
Who's worried?

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:36.920
Hello?

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.220
<i>Hello, is this Mr. Whitting?</i>

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.120
<i>This is Homeseal Security.</i>

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.320
Yes, this is Mr. Whiting.

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:50.020
<i>Hi, we're showing a motion-sensor failure
in your downstairs study.</i>

01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:51.420
Yes?

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:54.120
<i>Like I said, we're getting
a failure message.</i>

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.320
<i>Want me to stay on the phone
while you walk around, or send a car?</i>

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.920
I'll walk around.

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.720
Everything seems fine.

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.820
<i>How are we doing, Mr. Whiting?</i>

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:43.920
Everything's fine.

01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:00.720
<i>- The door's unlocked.
- Did you leave it unlocked?</i>

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:03.820
Send a car, you imbecile.

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.720
You were in Beirut in '84.

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.720
I lost friends there...

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.520
as I'm sure you did.

01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:54.920
I got a peek at your file.
You're a good man.

01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:59.820
One whose experience
is narrow and deep.

01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:02.120
Your entire career...

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.120
you've been used.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.820
And probably never even known
what for.

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:11.820
I didn't use to need to know.

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:16.620
In this town, you're innocent
until you're investigated.

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:23.020
Innocent until investigated? That's nice.
It's got a nice ring to it.

01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:28.020
I bet you've worn some miles
on little sayings like that.

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.820
Thank you.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.920
- Thank you.
- No.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.620
Gives the listener the sense of the law
being written as it's spoken.

01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:45.220
If anything happens to me or my family...

01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:48.520
an accident, an accusation, anything...

01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:52.120
then, first, your son will disappear.

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.320
His body will never be found.
Then your wife.

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:59.720
Her body will never be found either.
Now, this is guaranteed.

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.920
Then whatever is the most dangerous
thing that you do...

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:05.220
it might be flying in a small plane...

01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.820
might be walking to the bank...

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.820
you'll be killed.

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:14.020
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:18.020
I want you to acknowledge
that you do understand...

01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:21.720
so that we're clear
and there won't be any mistakes.

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:26.820
Beirut rules, Mr. Barnes?

01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:34.720
I want my passports back.

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:12.520
We are a small group...

01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:17.120
the ones who carry convictions
and ambitions.

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.420
And within this group...

01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:23.220
there is another, smaller group...

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:26.420
who flee from the worldly life...

01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:29.920
in order to spread the true faith.

01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:33.920
You're ready.

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:47.020
<i>Connex-Killen Oil announces the gift
of a new children's hospital...</i>

01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:49.720
<i>to be built in honor of the new emir.</i>

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:52.820
I wanted to be on a bobsled
in the Olympics.

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.220
What's a bobsled?

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.820
Wasim knows what a bobsled is.

01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:02.220
Papa, I need to ask you....

01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:04.420
Tell him about the bobsled!

01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:09.520
Tell him what a bobsled is.

01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:12.220
It's a little car.

01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:14.820
A little car that goes down a track
of ice and snow.

01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:17.520
Papa, may I borrow some money
for the bus?

01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:22.420
Oh, how the snow sparkles,
the crunch of it under your feet....

01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:53.220
Dalton's not enough.

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:56.520
I would be real careful.

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:01.020
You dig a 6-foot hole,
you'll find three bodies.

01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:03.820
But you dig 12, and maybe you'll find 40.

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.320
China's economy ain't growing
as fast as it could...

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:11.720
because they can't get
all the oil they need.

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:14.320
Now, I'm damn proud of that fact.

01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:18.520
We need another body, Mr. Pope.

01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:25.820
What if...?

01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:29.520
What if it involved somebody
at your firm?

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:33.020
Someone way the hell above you.

01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:40.020
We'd have to have an understanding.

01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:49.020
Well...

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.620
if....

01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:55.820
If he's as big as you say...

01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:00.020
then when he goes down,
the merger will be approved.

01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:03.120
Just like that?

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:10.220
We're looking for the illusion
of due diligence, Mr. Pope.

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.620
Two criminal acts
successfully prosecuted...

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:15.920
it gives us that illusion.

01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.220
Call me Jimmy.

01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:21.920
He's a visionary. He's like Faisal or
Atatürk. The people love him. And he's...

01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:24.120
The country's gonna be his by Monday.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.220
It's not like you guys have backed
the wrong horse here.

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:44.320
No, no. No, look,
he's got nine of 11 generals.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.420
We're on our way to the palace right now.
This is really happening.

01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.320
Silver Range Rover.

01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:56.920
<i>With a sunroof.</i>

01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:00.420
Silver Range Rover, sunroof,
fourth from lead.

01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:04.120
- Guys, help me out here.
- It's coming now.

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.820
His wife will be there. Pat.

01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:37.520
This is good.

01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:40.420
You done good.

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.020
Lee, you have guests.

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.620
- Syd.
- Leland.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.920
- Bennett Holiday.
- How are you, sir?

01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.320
- Lee Janus. How are we doing?
- Well.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:03.620
Those number crunchers can get
a little overzealous, can't they?

01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:11.320
Christ, when we write the GAAP rules
like some sort of abstract painting...

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:14.720
you stare at that liability
hard enough...

01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:17.820
and before long, it'll
turn into an asset.

01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:19.520
No, thank you.

01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:25.020
- You don't drink?
- No.

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:34.420
It is really beautiful out here.

01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:47.520
- What is that?
- What?

01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:49.320
In front of them.

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:23.720
The Bedouin always have right of way.

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.640
Lawyers say, "If you can't trust
a Big Five accounting firm...."

01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.720
The accountants say,
"We're not lawyers."

01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:32.620
Legal didn't understand.
Accounting didn't understand.

01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:36.220
Nobody understood anything.
Regulatory bodies scratched their heads...

01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:38.620
that nobody at Connex or Killen
was at fault.

01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:42.020
But this merger is so balance-positive
for American consumers...

01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:44.020
that, ultimately, Justice wants it.

01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:47.620
Federal courts want it.
Everybody wants it.

01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:51.820
Our real client, after all,
is us, the American people.

01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:56.620
And we are increasing American access
to oil in Kazakhstan.

01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:00.320
So all they ask is that we give them
a little something meaningful...

01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.020
which we did.

01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:04.420
And they got out of our way.

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.920
Something besides Dalton?

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:10.220
Unfortunately, yes.

01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:13.320
And the best option seemed to be...

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.220
a secret deal for excess
Iranian pipeline capacity...

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.820
that I uncovered during the diligence.

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:22.220
A little side deal benefiting
the lead lawyer...

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:25.020
involved in the Connex-Killen
merger approval process.

01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:26.620
What...

01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:28.320
do you think you're doing?

01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:31.220
It's illegal for an American
to control these rights.

01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:33.320
Stop right now.

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.920
Is there...

01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:42.120
something that
you wanna tell me, Syd?

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:56.920

I wanna thank our host
for a wonderful spread.

01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:10.820
The strawberry juice is delicious.

01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:16.920
Let me just say,
on behalf of Connex-Killen...

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:20.320
how pleased we are
to be back in the Gulf.

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:43.220
Your Highness?
Why don't you ride together.

01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:46.720
Oh, thank you, Bryan.

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:12.020

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.520
Who the hell is that?

01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:23.820
Excuse me. Hey, are you seeing that?

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:28.520
Hey!

01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:30.620
Hey!

01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:40.620
Could you tell who that is?

01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:48.220
Hey! Hey!

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:50.420
No, no, no! No!

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:38.320
- Take the target out.
- Roger.

01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:45.620
Four miles.

01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:57.820
Two miles.

01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.620
You're the Canadian.

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:24.320
Target destroyed.

01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:28.120
23:44 EDT.

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:46.220
I'd like to accept this award...

01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:51.920
on behalf of the employees
of Connex-Killen.

01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:56.820
Our people, the finest in the world.

01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:01.320
Guys, could I get you to stand up
for a moment? Please stand up.

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.220
Connex-Killen.

01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:46.020
And I'd also like to thank...

01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:49.720
our strategic friends from
around the globe who are here tonight.

01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:52.020
Most especially...

01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:55.320
Emir Meshal Al-Subaai.

01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.420
Emir. Thank you so much.

01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:47.420
<i>During the funeral...</i>

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:50.220
<i>I want everyone to be quiet...</i>

01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:53.620
<i>and I should be lying on my right side.</i>

01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:58.820
<i>You should throw dust on my body
three times while saying:</i>

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:01.920
<i>"From the dust we are created...</i>

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:04.920
<i>and to dust we return.</i>

01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:08.520
<i>From the dust a new person
will be created. "</i>

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:04.820
<i>Everyone should mention that
I died pure of heart...</i>

02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:08.220
<i>and that the next
world is the true life.</i>

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:18.120
<i>The next world is the true life.</i>

02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:31.020
Come on, man.

02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:35.220
Leave the beer.
