00:00.400 --> 00:02.603
‐Previously on
Y: The Last Man...
‐(ticking)

00:02.603 --> 00:07.241
‐Run!
‐(dings) I'm the president.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.743
‐Enough bullshit!
‐Jennifer's son is alive.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.412
She killed two soldiers
to keep it quiet.

00:12.412 --> 00:13.714
(screams)

00:13.714 --> 00:15.349
AGENT 525:
When'd she recruit you?

00:15.349 --> 00:16.350
She doesn't want to be found.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.684
‐(beeps)
‐Even by us.

00:17.684 --> 00:22.756
‐SONIA: What's this?
‐AGENT 355: Vibrator?

00:22.756 --> 00:25.659
Half the world died.
That was pretty weird.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.427
(chuckles)

00:27.427 --> 00:31.498
Hero?
She's a pistol.

00:31.498 --> 00:34.368
World ended, and she's
still stubborn as hell.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.336
‐SAM: What did she say?
‐That I'm selfish

00:36.336 --> 00:41.341
and self‐destructive
and, uh, cruel.

00:41.341 --> 00:42.476
Men ruined my life.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.645
Every last one of them
deserves to die.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.246
That's a waste of time.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.248
We need a place to live.
Supplies.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.817
I saw a man in a market
near Boston. He's nearby.

00:50.817 --> 00:55.489
A town with electricity.
Electricity? You're right.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.790
We should do it.
This one first.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.592
‐ROXANNE: Why him?
‐NORA: He's nearby.

00:58.592 --> 01:01.662
Town with food, electricity.
Everything we need.

01:01.662 --> 01:09.503
He can't hide. Not from us.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.538
‐(soft jazz music playing)
‐(indistinct chatter)

01:20.514 --> 01:22.649
‐WAITER: Any for you, ma'am?
‐WOMAN: No, thank you.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.618
(Yorick speaking indistinctly)

01:24.618 --> 01:27.387
I sit on the edge of it so
I'm eye level with the audience.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.423
I kind of meet them there.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.558
‐Did you know
Elvis had a twin brother?
‐DEAN: I did

01:31.558 --> 01:32.726
‐know that. I think I told you.
‐YORICK: I know.

01:32.726 --> 01:33.727
It's not
a question and answer thing.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.595
I thought you quit.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.597
‐What gave you that impression?
‐So,

01:36.597 --> 01:38.198
‐his name was Jesse...
‐Garon Presley.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.533
‐Really?
‐Let him finish.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.568
‐Sorry. I just can't believe
I remembered that.
‐YORICK: Okay.

01:41.568 --> 01:43.470
So, his name
was Jesse Garon Presley,

01:43.470 --> 01:44.571
and he was stillborn

01:44.571 --> 01:48.342
mere minutes before Gladys
gave birth to the King.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.677
They buried him in a shoebox.
And that's when I...

01:50.677 --> 01:52.312
‐That's when
I take out the shoebox.
‐DEAN: Do you think

01:52.312 --> 01:53.280
people at a magic show
want to be thinking

01:53.280 --> 01:54.615
‐about stillborn babies?
‐YORICK: No. No, no.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.383
The... The...
It's‐it's a question

01:56.383 --> 01:57.751
that I'm asking the audience.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.487
Right? Why does fate
choose one man over another?

02:00.487 --> 02:03.524
What if Jesse had lived
and Elvis had died?

02:03.524 --> 02:05.159
‐What if‐what if
they had both lived?
‐JENNIFER: What if Jesse

02:05.159 --> 02:07.394
‐was even better than Elvis? Mm.
‐YORICK: Exactly.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.329
‐So, this is performance art?
‐BETH: No,
it's still an escape...

02:09.363 --> 02:11.298
YORICK:
It's... I'm telling you
about it. So, in the box,

02:11.298 --> 02:12.666
there are chains, a rope,

02:12.666 --> 02:14.735
‐a pair of handcuffs.
‐Oh, thank God.
I was getting worried.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.436
‐(chuckles)
‐YORICK: I take them out
one at a time.

02:16.436 --> 02:20.240
Uh, the first one represents,
"my mother is a congresswoman,

02:20.240 --> 02:21.375
chair
of the House Intel Committee..."

02:21.375 --> 02:22.476
How did I get dragged into this?

02:22.476 --> 02:23.644
It's not‐it's not
a bad thing, okay?

02:23.644 --> 02:24.811
Then my dad,
this one represents,

02:24.811 --> 02:27.481
"my dad is a professor.
Tenured..."

02:27.481 --> 02:29.349
Not chair of the
Intel Committee, but still...

02:29.349 --> 02:31.618
Well, you did win a raffle
one time, honey.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.620
A DVD player
at a Boy Scout raffle.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.189
‐You should
totally mention that.
‐(laughs)

02:35.189 --> 02:36.456
YORICK:
I will mention that. So,

02:36.456 --> 02:38.458
I take them out one at a time.
It goes on like that, right?

02:38.458 --> 02:39.459
My parents' marriage,

02:39.459 --> 02:42.596
‐my girlfriend's PhD, my...
‐What about me?

02:42.596 --> 02:46.400
Yeah, you, too. You, too.
No, my sister is a paramedic.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.735
You know, blue ribbons
in horseback riding.

02:48.735 --> 02:51.205
I'm kidding.
I don't want to be a chain

02:51.205 --> 02:53.607
‐keeping you down.
‐It's not a chain
keeping me down.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.610
It's a poorly constructed
metaphor? No, I get it.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.811
‐Mm, well...
‐It's a work in progress.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.347
What do... What do you mean?
Do you think it needs something?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.316
‐I just mean
that you're still working on it.
‐No, I shouldn't...

03:02.349 --> 03:04.218
‐I shouldn't have mentioned
anything. It's, like, too early.
‐No.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.253
‐Oh.
‐I think it's very interesting.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.621
I do.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.789
Why don't you try
eating something.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.390
DEAN:
Is the idea
that you're weighed down

03:10.390 --> 03:12.593
by familial expectations?
No. No, no, no, no.

03:12.593 --> 03:17.231
No, it's the burden
of the straight cis white guy

03:17.231 --> 03:19.466
whose mom's in fucking Congress.

03:19.466 --> 03:24.338
DEAN:
Come on.

03:24.338 --> 03:27.474
‐Come on.
‐JENNIFER: Hero. It's a joke.

03:27.474 --> 03:35.415
What?

03:35.415 --> 03:37.417
♪

04:04.511 --> 04:06.747
♪

04:35.609 --> 04:37.411
♪

04:44.751 --> 04:46.753

05:08.475 --> 05:14.481
Get up. You okay?

05:14.481 --> 05:21.788
Yeah.

05:21.788 --> 05:29.129
Thanks. Thanks.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.506
ROXANNE:
Think this guy's for real?

05:39.506 --> 05:40.774
A survivor in Ohio?

05:40.774 --> 05:43.210
Doesn't matter.
Look how fast we got here.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.378
The girls are all fired up.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.480
Yeah, what happens if they
find out it's all bullshit?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.248
Well, we'll have a place
with resources,

05:48.248 --> 05:51.618
and they won't care.
You're all business, Nora.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.654
You ever had any fun?

05:53.654 --> 05:56.290
It's got to be
at least kind of interesting

05:56.290 --> 05:58.358
‐being a mother right now.
‐"Interesting."

05:58.358 --> 06:00.194
The world's gonna end.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.329
You don't have to raise your kid
to be somebody's wife

06:02.329 --> 06:03.463
or somebody's mother.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.199
She'll never have
to punch a clock.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.601
Have a boss.
There's some freedom in that

06:07.601 --> 06:09.169
if you get the stick
out of your ass.

06:15.609 --> 06:19.346
What's this?

06:19.346 --> 06:21.281
(both click tongues)

06:28.355 --> 06:30.491
This is what I'm gonna do
with you.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.525
(Ampersand chitters)

06:31.525 --> 06:35.596
Hey!

06:35.596 --> 06:37.331
Hey.
You seen Yorick?

06:37.331 --> 06:38.732
Inside.
Eating breakfast.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.469
Do you think he knows
about the Sunda rat? Who?

06:42.469 --> 06:44.505
Muller's giant Sunda rat.
Extinct now.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.807
It's only got
a six‐month life span.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.742
We still have a little more time
to save whales,

06:48.742 --> 06:51.745
but we're gonna lose mice soon.
And bunnies.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.480
You think he knows
how fucked we are?

06:53.480 --> 06:56.617
Oh, he only knows about crackers
and flinging his own shit.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.819
‐Sh‐Should we get him?
‐He'll stay close.

06:58.819 --> 07:06.193
He likes me more than Yorick. Oh.

07:06.193 --> 07:09.396
It happened again?

07:09.396 --> 07:13.467
Is there something
I could do to help?

07:13.467 --> 07:16.637
I could tie you to the bed.
Oh, that sounded...

07:16.637 --> 07:20.474
‐I just meant that...
‐Yeah, I've tried that.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.644
Turns out I can
escape restraints in my sleep.

07:23.644 --> 07:28.482
Has anything helped? A sandbag.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.417
I tied a ten‐pound sandbag
to my arm once.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.518
Slept like a baby.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.220
Hmm.
(chuckles softly)

07:33.220 --> 07:38.592
Not very practical for travel.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.461
Anyway, uh, Janis says
we can have a couple ATVs,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.263
so, we should be able
to get pretty far.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.199
We were getting somewhere
just now.

07:45.199 --> 07:46.466
We were talking like people.

07:46.466 --> 07:50.604
Look, the longer we stay here,
the more danger he's in. I...

07:50.604 --> 07:54.675
I'm feeling better, okay?
It's time. He'll be disappointed.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.244
He likes it here.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.547
(scoffs softly)
Well, he'll live.

08:00.547 --> 08:05.419
They got a greenhouse.

08:05.419 --> 08:08.422
NICOLE:
Greenhouse?
They got fucking lights.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.692
SONIA:
So, what's the idea?
You become Johnny Appledick,

08:11.692 --> 08:14.528
‐the Universal Donor?
‐(chokes, clears throat)

08:14.528 --> 08:16.497
You ever try knocking someone up
the old‐fashioned way?

08:16.497 --> 08:20.467
Uh, no. No,
Beth was pretty adamant

08:20.467 --> 08:23.203
that there wouldn't be kids
until she was on tenure track,

08:23.203 --> 08:24.638
‐so...
‐But you wanted kids.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.406
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐Always?

08:26.406 --> 08:32.479
‐No reservations?
‐Yeah. Hmm.

08:32.479 --> 08:35.749
Have you slept with anyone
since...

08:35.749 --> 08:38.719
(gasps softly)
Wait.

08:38.719 --> 08:42.523
Are you one of those guys
that thinks sex is a big deal?

08:42.523 --> 08:43.624
What is happening right now?

08:43.624 --> 08:44.658
How many women
have you slept with?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.293
(chuckles)

08:46.293 --> 08:50.731
Huh. Well, I've...
never really counted before,

08:50.731 --> 08:56.336
but, um... one.
You're fucking with me.

08:56.336 --> 09:02.342
No. Beth and I got together
when we were, uh, young. So...

09:02.342 --> 09:04.611
Morning.
Uh, you want some coffee?

09:04.611 --> 09:08.348
We leave tomorrow.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.350
NORA:
Main Street. The river.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.219
Community center.
Library. Greenhouse.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.554
It's a goddamn paradise.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.523
‐It's ours for the taking.
‐How many people
on the east side?

09:16.523 --> 09:18.458
‐Seven.
‐And 13 on the main drag.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.694
JODI:
Another ten in some
of the houses. Maybe a few more.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.263
That's what we could see.
We didn't want to get too close.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.631
NICOLE:
Town's pretty empty.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.200
Doesn't mean
they won't defend themselves.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.502
We can take
a handful of soccer moms.

09:28.502 --> 09:30.470
They've got electricity,
clean water, food.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.206
They're smart enough
to figure that out.

09:32.206 --> 09:33.740
I wasn't talking about you,
Nora.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.210
‐Hey, Mackenzie.
‐MACK: What? You play soccer?

09:36.210 --> 09:37.344
(chuckles)

09:37.344 --> 09:39.746
We'll split up
into three groups.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.482
Take the horses, we can
get out quick if we need to.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.351
Hit them fast,
drive them onto the street,

09:44.351 --> 09:45.452
where we can
keep them surrounded.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.354
Make them think there's
more of us than there are.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.823
How 'bout this?
We start shooting.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.358
Scare the fuck out of them.
They run off

09:51.358 --> 09:53.327
‐into the sunset.
‐RUTH: Hey!

09:53.327 --> 09:56.230
‐Get out of the fucking pool!
‐We found this place! It's ours!

09:56.230 --> 10:01.201
RUTH:
We were gone barely an hour.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.605
HERO:
Why don't you put the gun down.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.607
What are your names?

10:06.607 --> 10:08.475
‐What?
‐HERO: Your names.

10:08.475 --> 10:12.779
‐DIANA: Diana.
‐RUTH: Ruth. Well, Diana, Ruth,

10:12.779 --> 10:16.483
we like it here.
We're having fun.

10:16.483 --> 10:19.620
Maybe you should go
to one of the survivor's camps.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.654
Let the government
take care of you.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.755
There is no government.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.357
Camps?
Camps are disbanding.

10:23.357 --> 10:24.491
That's where we came from.

10:24.491 --> 10:30.330
Rioters stormed the Pentagon,
killed the president. Bullshit.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.199
Shot her in the head.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.468
People are building bonfires
on the roof.

10:34.468 --> 10:39.673
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.476
Go on, get.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.231
BETH:
But... Okay, so,
we've generally accepted

11:04.231 --> 11:06.333
the notion that democracy
is the only, um,

11:06.333 --> 11:10.337
civilized governing model.
Personal freedoms, capitalism,

11:10.337 --> 11:12.172
‐self‐determination.
‐DEAN: Uh‐oh,
she's coming for you, Jen.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.740
‐Oh, no, that's not what I...
‐JENNIFER: You won't catch me

11:13.740 --> 11:16.476
banging the drum for capitalism.
But don't quote her on that.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.412
All right, ignore him.
Keep going.

11:18.412 --> 11:21.548
Okay, well, this community
is matrilineal, collectivist.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.617
It's based on the idea
that your actions

11:23.617 --> 11:25.252
actually affect other people
and...

11:25.252 --> 11:29.223
What's happening on your phone?
Sorry, work thing.

11:29.223 --> 11:31.425
‐When does the, uh,
fellowship start?
‐BETH: Oh, I'm not sure

11:31.425 --> 11:33.393
I'm gonna take it yet be...
I just found out.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.496
Oh, my God, you're taking it.
She's taking it.

11:35.496 --> 11:37.731
‐Thousands of people applied.
‐BETH: Hundreds, not thousands.

11:37.731 --> 11:40.300
‐DEAN: Your mom
must be thrilled.
‐BETH: Uh,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.336

hit her that I might be leaving,

11:42.336 --> 11:43.604

‐YORICK: Oh, come on,
she's so excited.

11:43.604 --> 11:46.406
She's been talking
about Christmas in Sydney.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.741

11:47.741 --> 11:51.211

before we start making

11:51.211 --> 11:52.746

Couldn't find any hair dye.

12:18.272 --> 12:20.207
We should cut it off.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.744
Or shave it, maybe. Um,
do you have a razor around here?

12:23.744 --> 12:27.447

You think I'm gonna...

12:27.447 --> 12:29.650
I'm not shaving my head.

12:29.650 --> 12:35.355
You can't walk around
out there like that.

12:35.355 --> 12:40.327
What happened to you?
Those women in the Pentagon

12:40.327 --> 12:42.529
were working their ass off
24 hours a day

12:42.529 --> 12:44.731
to fix problems
you don't even know exist!

12:44.731 --> 12:50.270
Yeah, can't be fixed.
System's broken.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.473
So, that was your plan?

12:53.473 --> 12:56.376

Anarchy is the big idea?

Well, how do we find him?

13:04.751 --> 13:08.322
‐You don't.
‐You won't survive out there
without me.

13:08.322 --> 13:10.757
Lot's been going on
since you locked yourself up

13:10.757 --> 13:16.196
in your little fucking fortress,
okay? The world has changed.

13:16.196 --> 13:19.466
You stay here,
they will find you.

13:19.466 --> 13:26.473
And they will probably kill you.
Pack what you can carry.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.955

13:35.374 --> 13:37.109

13:37.109 --> 13:39.544

she's a stone‐cold badass.

13:39.544 --> 13:41.513
You know, defender of democracy.

13:41.513 --> 13:47.085
But in reality,
she's, uh, she's kind of...

13:47.085 --> 13:49.254
‐Kind of what?
‐Well, I was gonna say lonely,

13:49.254 --> 13:51.356

you're, uh...

13:51.356 --> 13:54.960

13:54.960 --> 13:56.061
No, I'm not.

13:56.061 --> 13:58.230
‐No, it's a compliment.
‐No, I am not your mother.

13:58.230 --> 14:00.365

‐And I'm not lonely.

Uh, you're not?
How is that possible?

14:03.001 --> 14:09.207

as much attention as you do?

14:09.207 --> 14:12.477
So, what about your spy friends?
The, uh, the Culper Ring.

14:12.477 --> 14:16.481

My handler was a man.

14:16.481 --> 14:19.484
So, what, you're the only woman
in the whole organization?

14:19.484 --> 14:23.355
Uh, no, they keep us separate.

14:23.355 --> 14:29.094

14:29.094 --> 14:31.129
Well...

We're safe here. I mean,

14:33.966 --> 14:38.270
Maybe, uh... maybe we stay?
At least‐at least until we can

14:38.270 --> 14:40.105
make contact with my mom?

14:40.105 --> 14:42.407
We can't stay 'cause
there's a pretty girl in town.

No, the lab's in San Francisco.

to kill anyone, so... Heads up.

44:03.335 --> 44:06.972
making assholes seem reasonable.
Go fuck yourself.

44:06.972 --> 44:08.941
You've got them all
living in fear.

44:08.941 --> 44:10.108
You girls are afraid of me?

44:10.108 --> 44:12.010
NORA:
Shame and humiliation

44:12.010 --> 44:13.879
and then compliments.
Yeah, I remember that.

44:13.879 --> 44:15.881
Every man I ever worked for.

44:15.881 --> 44:17.282
I am fucking done
with your shit, Nora.

44:17.282 --> 44:19.251
That's not my name.
No vision, right?

44:19.251 --> 44:20.852
‐Yeah.
‐NORA: I'm scared?

44:20.852 --> 44:24.089
I already tried your bullshit
20 fucking years ago.

44:24.089 --> 44:26.124
My mom named me Victoria.

44:26.124 --> 44:28.193
I hated it.
I hated her.

44:28.193 --> 44:31.029
I changed my name.
Got married. Had kids.

44:31.029 --> 44:32.397
I worked
for the fucking president.

44:32.397 --> 44:39.871
It doesn't work.
The real you is a shadow,

44:39.871 --> 44:47.179
and it is always there.
Athena, Hero, please escort

44:47.179 --> 44:49.014
this bitch out of my face.

44:49.014 --> 44:50.482
NORA:
She wants to change you.

44:50.482 --> 44:54.386
She wants to brand you. Chip away

44:54.386 --> 44:59.458
until you're exactly
what she wants you to be.

44:59.458 --> 45:01.994

♪

45:51.043 --> 45:54.313
We don't have
to reinvent ourselves.

45:54.313 --> 46:01.019
We don't serve Roxanne.
We don't belong to anyone.

46:01.019 --> 46:03.989
This world will learn to fear us

46:03.989 --> 46:08.260
because we'll show them
exactly who we are.

46:31.249 --> 46:38.190
Hey. Ah! Oh. Oh.

‐Wait, wait, wait. What?

46:54.039 --> 47:00.045
She told you? I'm sorry.

47:00.045 --> 47:06.285
My sister's brainwashed.

47:06.285 --> 47:12.124
And my mother's dead.

47:23.335 --> 47:28.907
Everywhere I go.
Everything I touch. Sonia.

47:28.907 --> 47:35.847
I should have died.
None of this would've happened.

47:43.255 --> 47:44.990
(Yorick sniffles)

47:44.990 --> 47:48.994
You want to know something
about me?

47:48.994 --> 47:56.368
When I was growing up,
my grandmother lived with us.

47:56.368 --> 48:01.406
She was a musician. A singer.

48:01.406 --> 48:08.880
One night, when I was 12,
she took me to a club.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.349
So, my parents come home,
we aren't there.

48:10.349 --> 48:14.052
When they finally find us,
my dad's...

48:14.052 --> 48:17.956
screaming at her, you know?
"What's wrong with you?

48:17.956 --> 48:21.226
What were you thinking?"

48:21.226 --> 48:25.063
So, we pile into the minivan,
and everybody's angry.

48:25.063 --> 48:28.133
Especially me, because that was
the best night of my life.

48:28.133 --> 48:30.035
And then,

48:30.035 --> 48:32.371
when we're a half mile
from home,

48:32.371 --> 48:34.473
a drunk driver jumps the lane,

48:34.473 --> 48:41.480
my dad swerves and hits a tree
going 60 miles an hour.

48:41.480 --> 48:47.452
Suddenly, I'm alone.
It's like, everybody's angry,

48:47.452 --> 48:50.822
and then they were gone.

48:57.896 --> 49:05.037
I should've died, but I didn't.
I survived.

49:05.037 --> 49:11.443
You will, too.

49:11.443 --> 49:17.149
I'm sorry about your mother.

49:17.149 --> 49:22.220
You're free to go if you want.
What?

49:22.220 --> 49:23.956
I take my orders
from the president.

49:23.956 --> 49:27.392
If she's dead...
You can give this up.

49:27.392 --> 49:32.798
Go live your life.
Find Beth. Wait. He...

49:40.005 --> 49:47.012
I don't want to be
a liability anymore. Or a pawn.

49:47.012 --> 49:50.382
Or a Y chromosome with legs.

49:57.289 --> 50:01.994
If we do this,
I can't be helpless.

50:01.994 --> 50:03.195
Okay? You have to teach me.

50:03.195 --> 50:05.030
Now,
I'm‐I'm‐I'm a quick learner,

50:05.030 --> 50:10.869
‐and I think I...
‐Okay. Okay? Prove it.

50:32.324 --> 50:38.063
Did you see anything?
How long were we moving?

50:38.063 --> 50:41.066
Only a couple hours.

You want me to go in there?

50:58.250 --> 50:59.985
‐Talk to them?
‐Not yet.

50:59.985 --> 51:01.987
Come get me
when she's on the move.

How'd they find us?

51:29.114 --> 51:30.248

It's a full tank of gas.
