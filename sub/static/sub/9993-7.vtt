WEBVTT

00:00.998 --> 00:02.025
Thank you.

00:03.827 --> 00:04.669
Good afternoon.

00:04.935 --> 00:06.951
You know, I've got some important news for you.

00:07.054 --> 00:08.926
No one is born rich.

00:08.977 --> 00:09.625
No one.

00:10.302 --> 00:12.668
Everyone is born naked and penniless.

00:12.719 --> 00:13.778
So how do you get rich?

00:13.829 --> 00:14.916
How do you stay rich?

00:15.116 --> 00:16.449
How do you get even richer?

00:17.488 --> 00:18.379
That's why we're here.

00:19.272 --> 00:20.241
That's what we want to know, right?

00:20.290 --> 00:21.524
Me? My theory?

00:21.573 --> 00:23.919
It all boils down to six words:

00:24.433 --> 00:26.504
What are you willing to do?

00:29.130 --> 00:30.060
Can you stand up for me, please?

00:31.372 --> 00:33.022
How much do you make a year, ma'am?

00:34.188 --> 00:35.719
I'd rather not say.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.455
I'll give you $100 to say.

00:38.597 --> 00:39.277
Two hundred.

00:41.560 --> 00:45.273
Uh, I make about $37,500 a year.

00:45.324 --> 00:47.027
$37,700 now.

00:48.210 --> 00:49.410
Liking this, right?

00:49.461 --> 00:50.508
Money's good.

00:50.588 --> 00:51.911
Money is good.

00:53.114 --> 00:54.880
Are you wearing clean underwear?

00:56.584 --> 00:57.705
Pardon me?

00:57.756 --> 00:58.715
Are you wearing clean underwear?

00:59.347 --> 01:00.127
It's just a question.

01:00.178 --> 01:02.039
And I will give you $100 to tell me.

01:03.235 --> 01:04.171
Sure.

01:04.509 --> 01:06.321
I'm wearing clean underwear.

01:07.690 --> 01:08.802
Take off all of your clothes,

01:08.853 --> 01:09.974
right here, right now,

01:10.025 --> 01:10.625
in front of everybody,

01:10.676 --> 01:12.824
and I will double your annual income.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.602
Bring you up to a cool $75,000.

01:14.653 --> 01:15.436
What do you say?

01:16.124 --> 01:17.187
No, no,

01:17.238 --> 01:18.626
I can't do that.

01:18.699 --> 01:19.639
No, no, no, no.

01:19.690 --> 01:20.502
Is that your husband?

01:21.000 --> 01:21.680
Yes.

01:21.788 --> 01:22.835
Couldn't he use the money, too?

01:23.829 --> 01:25.045
It doesn't matter, I...

01:26.117 --> 01:27.672
I'm not gonna do it.

01:28.411 --> 01:31.364
Besides, he doesn't want me to do it, either.

01:31.415 --> 01:32.015
Me! I'll do it!

01:31.822 --> 01:32.422
Pick me!

01:32.177 --> 01:33.253
I didn't ask you!

01:33.934 --> 01:35.066
It's easy for you.

01:35.325 --> 01:36.548
I'm asking her.

01:37.935 --> 01:39.659
You know, it's 3:15 in the afternoon.

01:39.746 --> 01:42.577
By 3:16, you could have doubled your annual income.

01:42.628 --> 01:44.671
You could have twice as much money as you have right now.

01:44.722 --> 01:45.937
You could pay off your bills.

01:46.563 --> 01:47.700
You could buy yourself something nice.

01:47.763 --> 01:48.916
All you have to do is...

01:50.270 --> 01:51.816
But I can't. Um...

01:52.545 --> 01:54.099
Thank you, anyway.

01:55.076 --> 01:57.614
Okay, I will triple your annual salary.

01:57.665 --> 02:00.640
Bring you up to $112,500.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.836
That's six figures.

02:01.887 --> 02:03.036
That's really nice.

02:03.700 --> 02:04.700
Just take off your clothes.

02:05.507 --> 02:06.363
But I can't.

02:07.870 --> 02:09.454
Why don't you ask one of them?

02:09.524 --> 02:10.395
'Cause I'm asking you.

02:11.909 --> 02:14.193
Okay, I'll triple your annual salary,

02:14.244 --> 02:14.986
not just this year,

02:15.037 --> 02:16.291
but for the rest of your life.

02:17.909 --> 02:19.795
Let's say you live over 30 years.

02:20.529 --> 02:21.890
That's over two million dollars.

02:21.941 --> 02:22.541
You'd be rich.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.594
You'd be a millionaire.

02:24.429 --> 02:25.078
What do you say?

02:26.621 --> 02:27.235
I can't.

02:28.001 --> 02:28.880
You can't or you won't?

02:29.839 --> 02:31.367
I won't do it.

02:32.599 --> 02:33.593
Is that your final answer?

02:35.135 --> 02:36.669
Yes, yes,

02:36.720 --> 02:38.238
that's my final answer.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.971
Remember these six words, folks:

02:41.022 --> 02:42.872
What are you willing to do?

02:44.971 --> 02:45.799
What about you, sir?

02:47.467 --> 02:48.205
Excuse me?

02:50.206 --> 02:52.455
Well, sure, I'd take off my clothes for a couple million.

02:52.546 --> 02:53.429
No, the question is:

02:53.480 --> 02:54.997
Will you take hers off?

02:56.735 --> 02:58.130
If  she lives 30 years,

02:58.303 --> 03:00.430
that's over $2,250,000.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.210
You'd be a millionaire.

03:01.261 --> 03:02.133
You'd be rich.

03:03.527 --> 03:04.730
What are you willing to do?

03:05.502 --> 03:06.312
What are you willing to do?

03:08.834 --> 03:09.574
I want to go.

03:10.009 --> 03:11.000
I want to leave!

03:11.201 --> 03:11.801
Shut up!

03:11.667 --> 03:12.997
What are you willing to do?

03:15.636 --> 03:16.931
Get off of me!

03:17.467 --> 03:19.194
A hundred dollars for anybody to help me!

03:19.671 --> 03:20.685
Get off of me!

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074

03:34.368 --> 03:35.246
What do you think about this?

03:37.792 --> 03:38.646
Nice.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.470
I don't want nice.

03:39.531 --> 03:40.432
It's jury duty.

03:40.670 --> 03:42.479
I want something that says "You can't trust this man."

03:43.374 --> 03:44.300
What do you think?

03:45.027 --> 03:46.225
Bowling or pineapples?

03:46.872 --> 03:48.171
I have no idea.

03:48.222 --> 03:48.822
Come on!

03:48.753 --> 03:49.375
This is your area.

03:49.426 --> 03:50.026
Help me out here,

03:50.026 --> 03:51.417
give me a little guidance-- pick one.

03:51.842 --> 03:52.732
I'll give you a hundred bucks.

03:53.573 --> 03:54.357
Go naked.

04:42.865 --> 04:43.534
The kids are up.

04:43.585 --> 04:44.613
I heard noises.

04:44.816 --> 04:47.577
Decided to go with clothes after all, huh?

04:48.347 --> 04:49.633
Don't say I didn't warn you.

04:49.965 --> 04:51.323
Help me!

04:51.814 --> 04:53.030
What  is going on?

04:53.540 --> 04:55.766
She's gonna murder me!

04:56.085 --> 04:57.156
There you are!

04:57.386 --> 04:59.097
No screaming.

04:59.148 --> 05:00.357
It's 6:30 in the morning.

05:00.408 --> 05:01.382
You're gonna wake the baby.

05:01.433 --> 05:02.360
That's my shirt,

05:02.411 --> 05:03.278
that's my sweater,

05:03.329 --> 05:04.256
that's my hair band.

05:04.373 --> 05:07.687
I put them out last night and she woke up first and she took them.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.501
Tell her she has to take them off!

05:10.552 --> 05:11.394
Bridgette...

05:12.919 --> 05:16.237
Take... them... off!

05:16.288 --> 05:18.949
But she took out 15 different things!

05:19.270 --> 05:20.989
Three. I was choosing.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.358
And I choose that!

05:22.441 --> 05:23.319
Okay, no snatching.

05:23.370 --> 05:24.800
Hey, hey, hey.

05:24.934 --> 05:26.047
Hold on a second.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.655
Everybody back up.

05:29.159 --> 05:31.035
Bridgette, you're wearing your sister's clothes.

05:31.086 --> 05:32.633
Did you ask before you put them on?

05:33.179 --> 05:33.779
Huh?

05:33.482 --> 05:34.851
No, she didn't.

05:35.240 --> 05:35.984
Why are you smiling?

05:36.033 --> 05:36.679
Did you ask?

05:37.608 --> 05:39.894
Okay, Ariel-- do you think,

05:39.945 --> 05:40.937
if she asks nicely,

05:41.196 --> 05:43.136
could you possibly wear one of the other two outfits

05:43.219 --> 05:44.308
that were contenders for today?

05:44.576 --> 05:45.237
I don't know.

05:46.193 --> 05:47.124
Why should I?

05:48.376 --> 05:49.133
Please?

05:50.178 --> 05:50.778
I guess.

05:50.922 --> 05:51.522
Okay.

05:51.410 --> 05:52.126
Thank you, Ariel.

05:52.748 --> 05:53.362
Whatever.

05:53.483 --> 05:54.745
It doesn't look good on you, anyway.

05:55.286 --> 05:55.886
See?

05:56.180 --> 05:58.394
Another crisis averted.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.279
Joe Dubois--

06:00.512 --> 06:03.305
our juries need citizens like you.

06:03.382 --> 06:04.631
Don't even say that.

06:04.682 --> 06:05.773
Someone might hear.

06:05.824 --> 06:06.424
Take that back.

06:06.404 --> 06:07.270
I will not.

06:07.607 --> 06:09.325
I am proud that you're summoned for jury duty.

06:10.141 --> 06:11.082
What's jury duty?

06:11.353 --> 06:14.653
It's a gigantic waste of Daddy's time, that's what it is.

06:15.116 --> 06:17.451
It's one of the things that makes our justice system great.

06:17.846 --> 06:18.875
When people get in trouble,

06:19.096 --> 06:21.040
they get to be judged by people just like them.

06:21.217 --> 06:22.212
It's called a jury.

06:23.081 --> 06:25.711
And it's every citizen's obligation to be on one.

06:25.762 --> 06:27.332
And it's an honor to be asked.

06:27.813 --> 06:28.479
Mommy's right.

06:28.530 --> 06:29.161
It is an honor.

06:29.212 --> 06:32.675
It's just a really inconvenient honor because Daddy has, like,

06:32.726 --> 06:35.800
three million things that he has to do at work,

06:36.078 --> 06:39.003
and I really can't afford the day.

06:39.965 --> 06:41.199
You'll be lucky if it's a day.

06:41.488 --> 06:42.146
It'll be a lot longer,

06:42.197 --> 06:43.268
if you get picked.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.871
Don't worry, I'm not going to get picked.

06:45.975 --> 06:47.713
You got a lot of faith in that shirt.

06:48.087 --> 06:50.889
It's not the shirt I'm counting on, darling; it's you.

06:51.305 --> 06:52.461
Me? What about me?

06:53.306 --> 06:56.248
You. You work for the DA.

06:57.051 --> 06:57.860
Think about it.

06:58.906 --> 07:02.414
What defense attorney is going to want the spouse of somebody who works for

07:02.465 --> 07:05.516
the DA sitting up there judging his or her client?

07:06.594 --> 07:07.254
You, darling,

07:07.895 --> 07:09.464
are my "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

07:12.338 --> 07:13.555
Mr. District Attorney...

07:15.126 --> 07:16.057
do you have a moment?

07:16.189 --> 07:17.173
Take  your time,
counselor.

07:17.224 --> 07:18.387
We're both going to the same place.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.462
They can't start without us.

07:19.766 --> 07:21.056
Well, how about we don't start at all.

07:21.545 --> 07:23.206
I've made six plea offers.

07:23.257 --> 07:24.561
You haven't even responded.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.722
Make me a serious proposal,
I'll be happy to respond.

07:27.161 --> 07:30.652
Okay. Class-B Criminal Negligence with a fine and community service.

07:32.340 --> 07:33.557
A  fine and community service?

07:33.670 --> 07:34.963
Your client killed his wife.

07:35.014 --> 07:36.255
No, he did not.

07:36.618 --> 07:38.354
Come on, the facts are not in dispute here.

07:38.405 --> 07:40.161
They were on the boat,
they were both drinking,

07:40.212 --> 07:42.896
he went to sleep and she fell overboard in the middle of the night.

07:42.947 --> 07:43.572
It's a horrible,

07:43.623 --> 07:45.956
terrible accident but it is not a violation of the law.

07:46.007 --> 07:46.940
Well actually, counselor,

07:46.991 --> 07:48.257
the facts are in dispute here.

07:48.308 --> 07:49.833
I'm not sure I believe your client's story.

07:50.084 --> 07:50.684
Excuse me?!

07:50.614 --> 07:52.096
But let's put that aside for the time being.

07:52.147 --> 07:53.922
Let's say we accept his version of things.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.447
He still committed a crime.

07:55.770 --> 07:57.407
It's called criminally negligent homicide.

07:57.458 --> 08:01.152
He left his severely intoxicated wife on the deck of a boat at sea.

08:01.418 --> 08:03.557
There was substantial and reasonable risk she would die.

08:03.669 --> 08:04.921
Yeah, I know the statute.

08:04.972 --> 08:05.948
Oh, I'm sure you do.

08:05.999 --> 08:09.517
And I know that you know that any kind of homicide requires proof that the

08:09.568 --> 08:10.981
victim be actually dead.

08:11.098 --> 08:12.053
Like a body.

08:12.104 --> 08:13.276
Which you do not have.

08:13.432 --> 08:15.749
You've had divers at the bottom of that lake for nine weeks.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.133
You have come up with nothing.

08:17.648 --> 08:19.073
So let's talk plea.

08:20.050 --> 08:20.981
Let's not.

08:22.196 --> 08:23.843
Moving along to number 19,

08:23.894 --> 08:25.429
Mr. Joseph Dubois.

08:27.972 --> 08:29.309
Joseph Dubois?

08:30.046 --> 08:31.585
Yes... Sorry.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.466
Yes. Present.

08:32.647 --> 08:33.971
Now, before the attorneys begin,

08:34.022 --> 08:36.006
I'd like to ask you about one thing.

08:36.371 --> 08:37.948
I noticed on your jury questionnaire,

08:38.010 --> 08:40.770
you noted that your wife works for the district attorney.

08:41.114 --> 08:41.775
Is that correct?

08:42.186 --> 08:44.147
Yes, that is correct.

08:44.429 --> 08:45.645
Mr. Dubois, as a juror,

08:45.696 --> 08:49.074
you have an obligation not to discuss this case or your opinions with anyone,

08:49.429 --> 08:50.399
including your wife.

08:51.007 --> 08:51.749
Will that be a problem?

08:52.387 --> 08:53.293
I don't think so, no.

08:53.802 --> 08:54.402
All right.

08:54.756 --> 08:55.646
Mr. Devalos?

08:56.382 --> 08:59.874
Has Mrs. Dubois done any work on this case at all?

09:00.227 --> 09:03.611
Has she met with Stephen Garner or any of the other witnesses?

09:04.310 --> 09:05.465
No, Your Honor, she has not.

09:06.009 --> 09:06.609
All right.

09:07.124 --> 09:07.815
Mr. Devalos,

09:08.121 --> 09:08.847
you may begin.

09:09.756 --> 09:12.179
We have no questions for Mr. Dubois.

09:12.230 --> 09:12.842
Thank you.

09:13.502 --> 09:14.153
Ms. Romney,

09:14.919 --> 09:17.285
I'm certain you do have some questions for Mr. Dubois.

09:17.705 --> 09:18.676
Thank you, Your Honor.

09:19.262 --> 09:20.019
Just  a few.

09:21.903 --> 09:23.132
Mr. Dubois...

09:24.348 --> 09:28.262
you say in your questionnaire that you work in the aerospace industry.

09:28.313 --> 09:29.478
What do you do exactly?

09:30.144 --> 09:32.023
I'm a systems design mathematician.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.129
And do you make a good living doing that?

09:34.834 --> 09:35.674
I do all right.

09:36.115 --> 09:38.804
Do you work with people who do much better than you do?

09:39.330 --> 09:40.055
Sure.

09:40.265 --> 09:42.546
A lot of our suppliers are start-ups, so...

09:43.508 --> 09:45.167
if you patent the right concept,

09:45.218 --> 09:47.050
you can start your own company.

09:47.425 --> 09:48.781
There's a lot of money in aerospace.

09:49.013 --> 09:49.758
Interesting.

09:49.813 --> 09:51.239
And how do you feel about those people,

09:51.290 --> 09:54.195
the ones who managed to strike it rich in your field?

09:55.865 --> 09:57.755
I guess I hope to be one... someday.

09:58.497 --> 09:59.363
Here's hoping.

10:01.306 --> 10:02.937
Do you drink, Mr. Dubois?

10:03.284 --> 10:04.234
Mm, sometimes.

10:04.285 --> 10:05.261
In moderation.

10:06.967 --> 10:08.398
Did you ever drink a little too much?

10:09.014 --> 10:10.539
Sure...
well, not for awhile.

10:10.590 --> 10:12.084
When I was younger.
In college.

10:12.406 --> 10:14.268
And, during one of those times,

10:14.319 --> 10:15.928
when you were under the influence of alcohol,

10:16.013 --> 10:19.194
did you ever make a decision you regretted?

10:19.653 --> 10:21.700
Or do something or say something that was...

10:23.256 --> 10:24.686
I don't know... ill-advised?

10:24.946 --> 10:26.039
Sure. Absolutely.

10:26.137 --> 10:27.391
I mean,
isn't that what college is for?

10:28.713 --> 10:29.830
Thank you, Mr. Dubois.

10:30.026 --> 10:31.480
- Okay. You're welcome.
- No more questions.

10:31.695 --> 10:32.912
All right, approach.

10:36.459 --> 10:39.090
Mr. Dubois is certainly an acceptable juror to the prosecution.

10:39.341 --> 10:40.668
What a surprise.

10:40.901 --> 10:41.649
Ms. Romney?

10:41.749 --> 10:44.119
Mr. Dubois is equally acceptable to the defense.

10:45.086 --> 10:45.843
Terrific.

10:46.305 --> 10:47.048
Your Honor,

10:47.177 --> 10:50.825
I'm concerned that either defense is setting up grounds for an appeal based

10:50.876 --> 10:53.578
on incompetent counsel or she needs another cup of espresso.

10:53.759 --> 10:54.642
No, Your Honor.

10:54.693 --> 10:57.673
Actually, Mr. Dubois is just what I'm looking for.

10:58.019 --> 11:00.387
He seems like an intelligent man, a logical man,

11:00.488 --> 11:04.218
with no apparent prejudices or predispositions against people who have more

11:04.269 --> 11:05.069
money than he does.

11:05.120 --> 11:08.304
He claims to have and understanding of how alcohol can impair your judgment,

11:08.536 --> 11:09.537
and, most of all,

11:09.588 --> 11:10.825
he seems like a fair man.

11:11.062 --> 11:11.935
And at the end of the day,

11:11.986 --> 11:13.358
what more can I ask for?

11:14.155 --> 11:14.784
Thank you.

11:15.410 --> 11:16.072
Mr. Dubois...

11:17.118 --> 11:17.718
Yes.

11:18.195 --> 11:18.813
Uh, sorry, your Honor,

11:18.864 --> 11:20.071
I was just hoping that I could get my, um,

11:20.588 --> 11:22.016
my slip from the clerk.

11:22.540 --> 11:23.480
Well, no, Mr. Dubois,

11:23.531 --> 11:24.380
you're not dismissed.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.019
You're serving on this jury.

11:26.396 --> 11:27.278
Congratulations.

11:32.652 --> 11:33.729
They finally asleep?

11:33.997 --> 11:34.644
That took awhile.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.875
I'm going to do lunches in the morning.

11:37.964 --> 11:38.762
I'm too tired.

11:39.055 --> 11:39.660
Okay.

11:40.557 --> 11:41.528
You almost ready for bed?

11:41.816 --> 11:42.416
Yeah.

11:43.029 --> 11:43.992
I just got to finish this.

11:45.620 --> 11:46.413
Until this trial's over,

11:46.464 --> 11:47.617
it's like I got two jobs.

11:48.338 --> 11:49.117
Hey, who's that?

11:50.667 --> 11:52.694
...in the death of his wife,
Jessica Garner.

11:52.777 --> 11:54.639
Hey, that's the guy who was in my dream last night.

11:54.690 --> 11:58.230
...of criminally negligenthomicide in a trial that begins today...

11:59.465 --> 12:01.147
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

12:01.672 --> 12:02.580
Where are you going?

12:02.814 --> 12:04.228
I  can't watch that news report.

12:04.566 --> 12:05.899
That's my case.
I can't watch that.

12:05.950 --> 12:07.596
That's the case I was picked to be a juror on.

12:09.594 --> 12:10.350
Turning to weather....

12:10.622 --> 12:12.606
The forecast,
mostly sunny skies today,

12:12.657 --> 12:13.723
with brisky, chilly winds...

12:13.774 --> 12:14.642
Is it over?

12:15.423 --> 12:17.136
The scary part's over.

12:19.517 --> 12:20.701
So that's your case, huh?

12:21.842 --> 12:23.329
I don't even think I'm allowed to answer that.

12:23.748 --> 12:26.160
Oh, come on. I don't know anything about it, honest.

12:26.691 --> 12:28.487
Ally, you just told me you had a dream about the guy.

12:28.780 --> 12:30.046
Yeah, it wasn't that kind of dream.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.755
It was a crazy dream.
A nonsense dream.

12:32.806 --> 12:34.223
Al, I don't want to talk about it, okay?

12:34.731 --> 12:36.512
Wow. Look who got religion.

12:36.938 --> 12:39.916
This morning you would have done anything to get out of jury duty.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.117
Now suddenly, you're the jury duty poster boy.

12:42.344 --> 12:42.944
Cute.

12:43.705 --> 12:45.083
You're not too bad yourself.

13:45.390 --> 13:46.346
Okay, guys,

13:46.397 --> 13:47.727
jackets and backpacks.

13:47.940 --> 13:48.829
Have a great day, guys.

13:49.162 --> 13:49.762
Bye, Mom.

13:49.748 --> 13:50.348
Bye, Dad.

13:50.921 --> 13:51.521
Bye, baby.

13:52.930 --> 13:54.990
Can we drive all together everyday?

13:55.184 --> 13:57.659
If gas doesn't get any cheaper, we might have to.

13:58.099 --> 13:59.929
It's kind of special today,
sweetie.

13:59.980 --> 14:01.963
Mommy and Daddy are working at the same place.

14:02.504 --> 14:03.584
Bridgette, come on.

14:04.322 --> 14:05.190
Bye, pumpkin.

14:05.364 --> 14:05.985
Bye, darlin'.

14:06.203 --> 14:06.803
Bye.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.127
I'm coming.

14:18.575 --> 14:19.386
Allison...

14:20.265 --> 14:21.056
What are you doing?

14:21.349 --> 14:23.641
Oh, just catching up on the Stephen Garner case.

14:24.261 --> 14:27.911
Okay... I just need you to stop reading what you're reading,

14:28.061 --> 14:29.533
get up and walk out of this room.

14:30.697 --> 14:31.481
Excuse me?

14:31.833 --> 14:33.464
Your husband is on the jury,
Allison.

14:33.620 --> 14:36.585
No, I know, I wasn't going to discuss any of this.

14:37.538 --> 14:38.198
It's just...

14:39.742 --> 14:41.294
I've been having dreams.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.031
You've had dreams about this case?

14:46.681 --> 14:48.831
Anything definite?
Anything that we should be investigating?

14:48.882 --> 14:50.051
Well, maybe.
I don't...

14:50.404 --> 14:52.478
I don't know how the pieces fit together.

14:52.529 --> 14:53.623
Okay, forget it.

14:54.087 --> 14:58.610
Allison, I just need you to please get up and walk out of this room.

14:58.751 --> 14:59.643
But why?

14:59.985 --> 15:00.585
Why?

15:01.112 --> 15:04.629
Because if a judge finds out that you are working on this case in any capacity--

15:04.680 --> 15:06.696
if he walked in right now and saw you with these files,

15:06.961 --> 15:08.327
we'd be looking at a mistrial.

15:08.649 --> 15:10.508
And Stephen Garner would walk.

15:11.062 --> 15:13.661
He would have murdered his wife and walked away.

15:14.327 --> 15:16.244
I don't understand.
He's not on trial for murder.

15:16.295 --> 15:19.136
It was an accident,
it was negligence, wasn't it?

15:19.651 --> 15:20.251
You know,

15:20.257 --> 15:23.773
it's funny, most of the time I'm staring at a crime and I'm looking for motive,

15:23.824 --> 15:25.405
means and opportunity.

15:25.573 --> 15:29.305
Here, I've got all three and yet I'm forced to behave as if there's no crime.

15:30.729 --> 15:31.893
I'm sorry,
I'm not following you.

15:32.398 --> 15:33.422
In my opinion,

15:33.937 --> 15:37.713
Stephen Garner took his rich wife out on that boat and killed her.

15:38.367 --> 15:39.890
Maybe he got her drunk and pushed her.

15:39.941 --> 15:42.738
Maybe he just smashed in her skull and threw her overboard.

15:42.789 --> 15:44.732
I don't have a body so I don't know.

15:45.153 --> 15:49.953
But whatever happened, the final result is she's dead and he did it on purpose.

15:50.364 --> 15:51.752
- But why?
- Money.

15:52.018 --> 15:52.618
Hers...

15:53.196 --> 15:54.879
a $40 million trust fund.

15:55.653 --> 15:57.314
But I can't prove that.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.914
So I'm hoping to get a conviction on criminally negligent homicide,

16:01.319 --> 16:03.773
and then, maybe, I can put him away for four years.

16:04.123 --> 16:06.297
Four years on a garbage charge.

16:06.824 --> 16:09.352
And that's all the justice I can offer this poor woman.

16:10.696 --> 16:13.369
So, please, don't make an impossible task harder.

16:13.479 --> 16:19.005
Just get up, walk out, and I'll give the files back to Sondra.

16:23.814 --> 16:25.589
We didn't even get on the water till after 10:00.

16:26.518 --> 16:27.905
Dropped anchor in Jefferson Cove.

16:28.532 --> 16:31.050
I started to cook dinner while she got out the wine.

16:32.610 --> 16:34.248
How much wine did your wife drink?

16:35.382 --> 16:36.380
I'm not sure.

16:37.004 --> 16:38.916
We finished, maybe,
three bottles.

16:39.245 --> 16:40.851
Three bottles of wine for two people.

16:42.850 --> 16:43.967
Would you say she was intoxicated?

16:44.428 --> 16:46.130
Yes. Uh, we both were.

16:47.165 --> 16:47.972
But, uh...

16:48.112 --> 16:49.564
it's not like we had to drive anywhere.

16:49.615 --> 16:52.916
I mean, we were in the middle of a lake on a boat.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.489
I really didn't think anything could happen.

16:54.700 --> 16:55.300
Mr. Garner,

16:55.228 --> 16:59.406
you testified that at midnight you went below and left your wife alone on deck.

16:59.823 --> 17:01.678
Yes, sir, that's correct.

17:02.860 --> 17:03.807
That... I was tired.

17:03.858 --> 17:04.571
Tired...

17:04.836 --> 17:06.973
from all the alcohol you consumed?

17:07.301 --> 17:08.607
Well, certainly that was part of it.

17:11.528 --> 17:12.558
And what was the rest of it?

17:21.345 --> 17:22.933
I'm sorry, you said that was part of it.

17:26.147 --> 17:28.079
We had an argument.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.352
I'm sorry, could you speak a little louder?

17:29.594 --> 17:30.194
Did you say,

17:30.490 --> 17:31.842
you and your wife had a fight?

17:32.062 --> 17:34.324
No. It was an argument.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.932
It was like a disagreement.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.065
An argument.

17:38.629 --> 17:40.631
You never mentioned an argument in your pre-trial deposition.

17:40.794 --> 17:44.192
Your Honor, I need a moment to confer with my client.

17:44.929 --> 17:47.575
Well, your client chose to testify in his own defense, Miss Romney.

17:47.917 --> 17:49.352
He can confer after court.

17:49.487 --> 17:50.351
So, you had an argument.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.272
Was it heated?

17:52.323 --> 17:52.999
Was it violent?

17:53.168 --> 17:54.016
No, of course not.

17:54.187 --> 17:56.166
It was just... it was an argument.

17:57.199 --> 17:59.993
Jess was very insecure about the way she looked.

18:00.328 --> 18:04.032
And sometimes when she drank she'd accuse me of marrying her for her money.

18:05.566 --> 18:06.190
Really?

18:08.271 --> 18:09.405
Any truth to that, Mr. Garner?

18:09.530 --> 18:10.496
Did you marry her for money?

18:10.547 --> 18:11.231
Objection. Irrelevant.

18:11.282 --> 18:14.141
I married her because I had no choice.

18:16.111 --> 18:19.566
I married her because the moment I met her I could think of nothing else.

18:20.916 --> 18:25.355
I married her because the thought of spending a single day without her by my side...

18:30.511 --> 18:31.817
And I'll bet the money didn't hurt.

18:31.968 --> 18:32.996
Objection, Your Honor.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.484
Sustained.

18:36.797 --> 18:40.733
Yeah, "but I bet the money didn't hurt." I don't like that guy.

18:41.452 --> 18:42.317
Who, the D.A.?

18:42.660 --> 18:44.899
- Yeah.
- Well, he's got to try and make a case.

18:45.097 --> 18:46.609
What are you talking about?
There is no case.

18:46.943 --> 18:49.471
A guy goes to sleep, wakes up and his wife's gone.

18:49.859 --> 18:51.814
That's a crime?
Hell, half the world is guilty,

18:51.961 --> 18:52.872
then, including my ex.

18:53.516 --> 18:54.683
This is a tragedy,

18:55.014 --> 18:56.840
maybe a mystery,
but it isn't any crime.

18:57.854 --> 18:58.729
Daddy!

18:59.469 --> 19:00.498
Hi.

19:00.903 --> 19:02.936
Hi. Whoa.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.123
Daddy!

19:04.671 --> 19:05.599
I'll see you tomorrow, Joe.

19:05.650 --> 19:06.580
I got to go buy a seat cushion.

19:06.947 --> 19:07.547
Okay.

19:07.588 --> 19:09.050
Mommy said that if we all came,

19:09.101 --> 19:10.958
then we could all go out to dinner and I could choose where.

19:11.137 --> 19:13.675
Yeah? Well, if that's what Mommy said, that's what Mommy said.

19:13.805 --> 19:14.581
Really?

19:14.770 --> 19:16.091
Oh, God I love this.

19:16.498 --> 19:20.172
We drive in together,
I'm done by 5:00, we eat together.

19:20.358 --> 19:21.484
Forget everything I said this morning.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.272
I may apply to become a career juror.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.654
Well, don't fill out that application just yet.

19:26.868 --> 19:28.249
You might want to give it a week or two.

19:28.892 --> 19:31.079
I don't know.
If today's any indication,

19:31.161 --> 19:32.911
I don't know if this thing's going to go a week or two.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.534
Frankly, I don't think your boss has very much to work with.

19:36.084 --> 19:37.693
Okay, what's it going to be,
sweetie?

19:38.008 --> 19:39.137
I want chicken fingers.

19:39.188 --> 19:40.168
Pick a chicken place!

19:54.447 --> 19:56.540
My turn to choose and I choose Italian.

19:56.759 --> 19:58.100
Italian? Okay. Where's Mom?

19:59.756 --> 20:00.513
Where's Mommy going?

20:04.547 --> 20:05.147
Hi.

20:40.674 --> 20:41.583
They hate your boss.

20:43.043 --> 20:43.946
They think he has no case.

20:44.616 --> 20:45.707
Who, the jury?

20:45.966 --> 20:47.385
I thought we weren't supposed to discuss...

20:47.474 --> 20:49.278
No, I'm not talking about the facts of the case.

20:49.329 --> 20:50.601
I'm just talking about your boss.

20:51.118 --> 20:52.027
Tell him to lighten up.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.007
Or don't. I...

20:56.333 --> 20:58.489
It's just so weird not being able to talk to you about something that

20:58.540 --> 21:00.152
consumes so much of my day.

21:00.709 --> 21:01.919
Well, yeah, likewise.

21:05.378 --> 21:06.205
Remember, if we see her,

21:06.256 --> 21:07.992
you're on your own--
I can't be a part of this.

21:08.415 --> 21:09.135
Understood.

21:12.807 --> 21:14.030
Tell me again,
what'd you see exactly?

21:14.420 --> 21:15.571
They were in bed,
they were making love.

21:15.622 --> 21:16.862
What do you want, details?

21:17.016 --> 21:17.853
Sure, if you're offering.

21:21.938 --> 21:22.840
His wife's been gone seven months.

21:22.891 --> 21:24.635
I wouldn't be crazy to think he's got a girlfriend.

21:25.247 --> 21:25.866
Well,
that's true,

21:25.917 --> 21:28.844
but yesterday they went out of their way to act like they didn't know each other.

21:35.820 --> 21:38.019
I'll meet you here ten minutes before the, uh, lunch recess.

21:40.056 --> 21:40.656
Thank you.

21:40.673 --> 21:41.315
Sure.

21:42.775 --> 21:44.789
Mr. Hammond, when...

21:45.047 --> 21:46.377
your daughter Jessica was born,

21:46.440 --> 21:49.456
you arranged for a trust fund to protect her inheritance.

21:50.596 --> 21:52.825
Can you tell me how much that fund is worth today?

21:54.147 --> 21:56.759
I would say approximately $42 million.

21:56.837 --> 21:57.706
$42 million.

21:59.074 --> 22:00.324
And upon her death,

22:00.765 --> 22:02.010
who would inherit that money?

22:02.907 --> 22:03.653
Her husband.

22:04.146 --> 22:06.214
With all due respect,
Mr. Hammond, doesn't that...

22:06.584 --> 22:07.277
give you pause?

22:07.423 --> 22:08.189
Objection, Your Honor.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.420
The district attorney is asking for an opinion

22:10.471 --> 22:12.904
that has no relevance to the case before this court.

22:13.072 --> 22:13.672
Overruled.

22:14.166 --> 22:14.872
I'll allow it.

22:15.590 --> 22:17.294
H-Have you ever met my son-in-law, sir?

22:19.406 --> 22:21.135
He came into my office 12 years ago.

22:21.991 --> 22:24.334
He had on a sport coat that looked like it probably cost.

22:24.838 --> 22:27.680
.. $60 and a tie that cost about ten,

22:28.410 --> 22:31.070
and he said, "I'd like to work for you, sir.

22:31.301 --> 22:32.512
"I'd like to learn from you, sir,

22:32.563 --> 22:35.950
I'd like to learn how to make money." And, uh,

22:36.716 --> 22:39.335
I asked him the question I ask everyone who says they want to work for me.

22:39.386 --> 22:40.205
I asked,

22:41.403 --> 22:42.352
"What are you willing to do?

22:43.256 --> 22:47.872
" And he said, "I'm willing to do anything, sir." And he was telling the truth.

22:48.536 --> 22:49.574
For the next year and a half,

22:49.764 --> 22:50.919
he unstopped toilets,

22:51.410 --> 22:52.195
he delivered mail,

22:52.831 --> 22:53.991
he ran errands,

22:54.378 --> 22:55.629
he brought everyone lunch.

22:55.910 --> 22:59.074
He was the first one there in the morning and the last one to leave at night.

23:00.321 --> 23:01.668
He knew nothing about finance.

23:02.094 --> 23:03.105
But after 18 months,

23:03.164 --> 23:04.654
he was teaching me things.

23:07.444 --> 23:08.659
That's who my son-in-law is.

23:09.202 --> 23:09.802
And...

23:10.274 --> 23:12.209
how did he come to meet your daughter?

23:13.538 --> 23:14.804
Well, I introduced them.

23:15.310 --> 23:15.910
Uh...

23:17.510 --> 23:18.869
put them together anyway.

23:19.429 --> 23:20.662
And how did that come about?

23:21.639 --> 23:22.919
From time to time in my business,

23:22.970 --> 23:25.436
there are work-related functions.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.286
Uh, charity events,

23:26.593 --> 23:27.348
award dinners.

23:28.511 --> 23:30.745
I was always encouraging Stephen to go,

23:31.215 --> 23:32.450
but he would always decline.

23:33.046 --> 23:36.268
Finally, he confessed to me that he was intimidated,

23:37.218 --> 23:38.552
afraid of making a fool of himself.

23:40.036 --> 23:41.306
Picking up the wrong fork,

23:41.811 --> 23:43.298
drinking from the wrong glass,

23:43.349 --> 23:44.213
that sort of thing.

23:45.372 --> 23:49.875
While a man who looks like him certainly had no shortage of women in his life,

23:51.277 --> 23:53.818
he did let me know that none of them

23:53.869 --> 23:58.084
were of a caliber he felt comfortable
bringing to a work-related function.

23:58.735 --> 24:04.489
So I suggested that perhaps he should ask Jessica to accompany him.

24:04.813 --> 24:05.413
And...

24:05.546 --> 24:07.272
obviously, that worked out.

24:10.405 --> 24:11.251
My Jessica...

24:15.256 --> 24:17.816
...was asleep for the first 24 years of her life,

24:20.430 --> 24:22.548
and then she met... this man,

24:22.845 --> 24:24.307
and... and she...

24:31.501 --> 24:32.369
I was...

24:32.485 --> 24:34.082
I was hoping that she would...

24:36.505 --> 24:37.418
have children.

24:40.694 --> 24:41.596
I know they both want...

24:42.800 --> 24:44.225
desperately wanted children.

24:50.168 --> 24:51.194
I'm sorry.

24:53.889 --> 24:55.520
I've completely forgotten the question.

24:56.322 --> 24:57.403
The $42 million.

24:59.500 --> 25:00.654
Doesn't it make you wonder?

25:02.760 --> 25:03.449
About what?

25:18.955 --> 25:19.555
That's her.

25:20.810 --> 25:21.485
You better go now.

25:27.208 --> 25:28.506
I knew him in college;

25:28.557 --> 25:29.628
I haven't talked to him since then.

25:31.041 --> 25:31.929
You went to school with him?

25:33.276 --> 25:35.047
No. He lived in town.

25:36.298 --> 25:37.701
He worked at his stepfather's bar.

25:38.763 --> 25:42.278
Anyway, he was great looking back then, too,

25:42.524 --> 25:44.293
and I knew my parents wouldn't approve, so...

25:45.562 --> 25:46.455
I had to have him.

25:47.338 --> 25:48.016
You dated him?

25:49.200 --> 25:50.217
You could call it dating.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.081
It was more like sex and fighting.

25:52.716 --> 25:53.902
So wait, I'm confused.

25:54.455 --> 25:55.502
If you haven't talked to him in years,

25:55.553 --> 25:56.798
why are you coming to court every day?

25:57.574 --> 25:58.305
Saw it in the papers.

25:59.474 --> 26:00.350
See something like that,

26:01.139 --> 26:02.250
and you know the people it happened to,

26:03.711 --> 26:04.571
it freaks you out a little.

26:05.589 --> 26:06.499
And I guess I felt...

26:07.546 --> 26:08.325
a little responsible.

26:08.885 --> 26:09.691
What do you mean?

26:11.306 --> 26:12.270
I sort of introduced them.

26:12.953 --> 26:14.311
Wait a second, I thought I read in the paper,

26:15.690 --> 26:17.331
uh, that the dad introduced them,

26:17.382 --> 26:18.566
that they met through work or something.

26:19.114 --> 26:19.825
I read that, too.

26:20.923 --> 26:21.748
The truth is,

26:22.250 --> 26:24.412
we were all at the country club one night, and...

26:25.132 --> 26:26.521
This was, like, 13 years ago,

26:26.572 --> 26:28.659
way before he ever started working for her father.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.553
Oh, God, Jess didn't even notice Stephen.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.546
I mean, why would she?
He was the bartender.

26:34.948 --> 26:36.822
But she definitely made an impression on him.

26:37.502 --> 26:38.177
What do you mean?

26:38.830 --> 26:40.282
Well, he heard she had serious money.

26:40.989 --> 26:43.120
So after the party, he wanted to know everything about her.

26:43.432 --> 26:45.197
What did she like to do,
what kind of guys did she like.

26:45.248 --> 26:47.845
I mean, he wanted to know everything there was to know about Jessie Hammond.

26:48.391 --> 26:49.457
And this was 13 years ago.

26:50.113 --> 26:52.407
Mm-hmm. I told him he didn't have a chance  with her--

26:52.646 --> 26:54.142
she was a real daddy's girl.

26:54.916 --> 26:55.992
You know, only child,

26:56.332 --> 26:57.567
no mom, shy.

26:59.769 --> 27:01.301
I guess he figured the key to Jess was her dad,

27:01.352 --> 27:02.475
'cause the next thing I knew...

27:03.343 --> 27:04.209
he was working for him.

27:04.802 --> 27:06.535
Well, I still don't get it-- you knew the guy,

27:06.631 --> 27:07.750
you had a thing with the guy,

27:08.231 --> 27:09.496
but that was some time ago,

27:09.604 --> 27:11.487
and yet here you are coming to court every day.

27:16.166 --> 27:17.656
I told you, I guess I feel a little responsible.

27:19.597 --> 27:20.274
Why?

27:22.461 --> 27:23.543
I don't know, um,

27:24.154 --> 27:25.566
Stephen was asking me about Jessica for,

27:25.617 --> 27:26.571
like, the hundredth time.

27:26.710 --> 27:28.879
You know, like, did I think she really had that much money,

27:28.930 --> 27:29.600
that sort of thing,

27:29.651 --> 27:30.531
like he's on a mission.

27:31.444 --> 27:33.019
And I told him to forget about it,

27:33.070 --> 27:34.226
that it was never gonna happen--

27:34.590 --> 27:35.190
I mean...

27:37.071 --> 27:38.299
that boy likes the bedroom.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.286
I knew he was nailing me and, like, six other girls.

27:43.978 --> 27:45.524
The thought of him getting married,

27:45.718 --> 27:46.977
the thought of him being exclusive,

27:47.187 --> 27:50.231
I just... I didn't think he had it in him.

27:50.282 --> 27:51.437
And I told him so.

27:53.107 --> 27:55.445
And I told him that if he married Jess...

27:56.461 --> 27:57.250
she'd care.

27:57.999 --> 27:59.674
And her dad would care more.

28:01.661 --> 28:04.202
Anyway, I remember Stephen looked at me,

28:04.253 --> 28:04.986
and he said...

28:06.330 --> 28:07.820
hey, a person would just have to marry her,

28:07.871 --> 28:09.759
he wouldn't necessarily have to stay married to her.

28:17.334 --> 28:18.479
Ask me what I know.

28:20.428 --> 28:21.165
Doesn't matter.

28:21.455 --> 28:22.534
You're right,
it was a plan.

28:22.585 --> 28:24.184
He's been working it since the early '90s.

28:24.241 --> 28:25.791
The guy is a classic sociopath.

28:26.270 --> 28:27.793
Allison, it doesn't matter.

28:28.139 --> 28:30.071
Court the father, then court her.

28:30.195 --> 28:32.369
Marry her,
then kill her and take her money.

28:33.338 --> 28:34.293
A girl he once knew,

28:34.344 --> 28:35.289
an old lover,

28:35.800 --> 28:37.076
she saw the whole thing happen.

28:37.473 --> 28:38.829
I believe you, Allison, but,

28:38.880 --> 28:41.229
honestly, it does not matter.

28:41.280 --> 28:41.895
It does!

28:41.946 --> 28:42.835
The jury is with him.

28:42.886 --> 28:43.754
They're not with you.

28:43.940 --> 28:45.297
This is what he's great at--

28:45.348 --> 28:46.312
winning people over.

28:46.781 --> 28:48.622
You have to give them some evidence.

28:49.232 --> 28:50.589
This woman, I know,

28:50.723 --> 28:53.651
Scanlon seems to think most of what she has to offer is hearsay,

28:53.896 --> 28:57.905
but I think you take it to the judge, you tell him what this woman...

28:57.956 --> 28:58.729
Allison.

29:00.426 --> 29:02.826
We finished our closing arguments over an hour ago.

29:02.948 --> 29:04.641
The case is with the jury; it's over.

29:07.917 --> 29:08.912
Go home.

29:09.641 --> 29:11.050
And let's both try to get a good night's sleep.

29:17.671 --> 29:20.518
Absolutely, there's not a doubt in my mind.

29:22.990 --> 29:24.440
Even if I'm off by an hour,

29:24.551 --> 29:27.238
I will definitely be in the office by 3:00.

29:29.090 --> 29:30.782
No, tomorrow, I'll be done.

29:32.806 --> 29:34.003
Okay, tomorrow.

29:36.334 --> 29:37.775
They can't exist without me for three days.

29:38.858 --> 29:39.950
I guess that's the good news.

29:40.718 --> 29:43.162
How can you be so sure he'll be back at the office by 3:00?

29:43.494 --> 29:45.987
Aren't deliberations starting tomorrow?

29:46.439 --> 29:48.056
Darling, there's nothing to deliberate.

29:48.529 --> 29:51.163
The only suspense is how long it's gonna take to count the hands.

29:52.088 --> 29:53.989
Is that what you've been upset about since you got home?

29:55.959 --> 29:57.227
Al, talk to me.

30:08.218 --> 30:09.030
I can't.

30:12.142 --> 30:14.626
No! Please, God!

30:14.896 --> 30:17.154
No! I love you!

30:17.822 --> 30:19.436
No! Please, don't!

30:20.014 --> 30:21.560
Please! Oh, my God!

30:22.236 --> 30:23.966
I love you! Please!

30:41.491 --> 30:44.109
Hey... you okay?

30:44.514 --> 30:45.280
Yeah.

30:46.197 --> 30:47.596
Oh, yeah, I'm okay,

30:47.657 --> 30:51.488
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

30:53.130 --> 30:54.239
Oh, I don't know,

30:54.401 --> 30:55.443
I don't know.

30:56.198 --> 30:56.852
Don't ask me;

30:57.138 --> 30:57.950
I can't tell you.

30:58.094 --> 30:59.072
I can't talk about it.

30:59.525 --> 31:00.348
What do you mean?

31:00.486 --> 31:01.416
What is there not to talk about?

31:07.309 --> 31:08.010
Oh.

31:16.725 --> 31:17.366
It's okay.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.004
Really, I'm okay.

31:21.259 --> 31:22.492
Just go back to sleep.

31:30.441 --> 31:31.678
Hey, whatcha doing?

31:33.151 --> 31:34.058
Waiting for you to wake up.

31:35.868 --> 31:37.506
Come on, go back to sleep.

31:37.739 --> 31:38.675
I need you to tell me.

31:40.334 --> 31:41.409
Tell you what?

31:43.695 --> 31:44.728
You're dreaming.

31:45.902 --> 31:46.888
Every night.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.607
If this case were as simple as the one that's being presented in that courtroom,

31:53.658 --> 31:55.148
there'd be nothing for you to dream about.

32:00.091 --> 32:00.999
So?

32:01.585 --> 32:02.820
So I want to know what you're seeing.

32:04.580 --> 32:05.450
I want to know what you know.

32:07.324 --> 32:09.149
I can't tell you what I know.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.425
I wish I could.

32:12.387 --> 32:14.757
I wish it would make a difference, but...

32:17.221 --> 32:18.381
it just doesn't.

32:20.016 --> 32:21.843
I know you all have lives and other things to do,

32:21.894 --> 32:23.919
so as your newly elected foreman,

32:23.970 --> 32:25.457
I'd like to get the ball rolling.

32:25.669 --> 32:26.778
I'd also like to, uh,

32:26.829 --> 32:29.376
take a test vote just to see where we stand.

32:30.017 --> 32:32.720
Remember, there's only one charge here:

32:33.175 --> 32:37.493
guilty or not guilty due to criminally negligent homicide.

32:39.768 --> 32:40.614
So can I see some hands?

32:41.460 --> 32:42.184
Not guilty.

32:48.121 --> 32:49.400
Uh, Mr. Dubois,

32:50.028 --> 32:50.968
I said "not guilty."

32:52.100 --> 32:52.994
That means, you know,

32:53.045 --> 32:53.831
he didn't do it.

32:54.003 --> 32:55.420
Yes, I understood the question.

32:57.410 --> 32:58.567
Easy, everyone.

32:58.704 --> 33:00.413
The man is entitled to his opinion.

33:00.478 --> 33:03.473
Yeah, well, I think the man wasn't in the same courtroom as everyone else.

33:04.126 --> 33:07.183
Are you telling me that you really think that this guy did something wrong?

33:07.861 --> 33:08.883
No, I just... I...

33:09.512 --> 33:10.422
I think we have a job to do,

33:10.473 --> 33:12.207
and we have to do it carefully,

33:12.265 --> 33:12.865
that's all.

33:13.049 --> 33:14.646
Then I'd like to see your hand.

33:15.078 --> 33:15.850
We're here to vote.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.288
That is your job.

33:17.932 --> 33:19.155
No, it isn't, Mack.

33:19.495 --> 33:20.797
I'm here to examine the evidence,

33:21.000 --> 33:22.413
deliberate, make a decision.

33:23.074 --> 33:24.413
My job's to do all those things.

33:24.936 --> 33:25.658
Examine the evidence?

33:26.018 --> 33:26.814
What evidence?

33:27.375 --> 33:31.167
Can you show me a scrap of evidence that tells me that this guy did anything--

33:31.562 --> 33:32.162
anything--

33:32.636 --> 33:33.323
to hurt his wife?

33:33.746 --> 33:35.190
No, I can't. Not now.

33:35.241 --> 33:35.996
Maybe never.

33:36.196 --> 33:39.349
But his wife is dead, and he is staring at a potful of money.

33:39.749 --> 33:42.847
And I just know that I'd feel a lot more comfortable telling this guy he's

33:42.898 --> 33:47.433
free to walk if I knew that I'd spent a little bit of time just going over

33:47.484 --> 33:51.216
everything that I'd heard just in case there's something,

33:51.267 --> 33:53.355
something that we might've missed.

33:54.764 --> 33:58.214
You know, I wouldn't mind a quick review of everything just to be sure.

33:58.752 --> 34:00.321
A quick review of everything, huh?

34:01.242 --> 34:06.258
Okay, so, Stephen Garner said that he and his wife Jessica left their home...

34:06.949 --> 34:10.083
9:00 p.m. to drive up to Lake Prescott.

34:36.513 --> 34:37.215
No word yet.

34:38.129 --> 34:38.899
Excuse me?

34:39.775 --> 34:41.547
The jury-- they're still deliberating.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.137
Who knows?
Maybe we do have a chance.

34:46.650 --> 34:47.679
I'm sorry.
Was there something else?

34:48.103 --> 34:48.842
This box.

34:49.585 --> 34:50.355
Yeah, it's the case file:

34:50.639 --> 34:52.067
Phoenix, Arizona vs. Stephen Garner.

34:53.264 --> 34:54.842
Care to take a look?
Can't do any harm now.

34:56.079 --> 34:57.658
Yeah, I-I wouldn't mind.

34:58.502 --> 34:59.183
Go ahead.

34:59.485 --> 35:00.316
Have a party.

36:02.273 --> 36:03.197
I need to speak with you.

36:03.476 --> 36:04.076
Speak.

36:04.317 --> 36:06.122
I think I know where she is--
her body, I mean.

36:06.358 --> 36:08.612
He killed her in the woods--
a place called the Mazatzal Mountains.

36:09.484 --> 36:12.131
The reason you couldn't find her in the lake is she never got on that boat.

36:13.812 --> 36:14.595
Say something.

36:15.220 --> 36:16.063
The jury's back.

36:22.326 --> 36:23.417
In the matter of the State vs.

36:23.468 --> 36:27.249
Stephen Garneron the charge of criminally negligent homicide, how do you find?

36:31.038 --> 36:32.061
We find the defendant...

36:33.122 --> 36:33.963
not guilty.

36:38.408 --> 36:39.653
So say you all, Mr. Foreman?

36:40.336 --> 36:41.394
So say we all.

36:56.569 --> 36:58.670
And if you do this a hundred times every night,

36:59.007 --> 37:01.902
your hair will never tangle and it will always shine.

37:02.797 --> 37:03.962
A whole hundred?

37:04.555 --> 37:05.926
A whole hundred.

37:06.614 --> 37:07.863
Will it shine like yours?

37:08.260 --> 37:08.951
Uh-huh.

37:09.462 --> 37:10.245
Cool...

37:15.687 --> 37:16.658
Come on, girls.

37:17.180 --> 37:19.287
It's already ten minutes past your bedtime.

37:22.693 --> 37:23.410
Hello?

37:23.709 --> 37:24.770
Want to hear something funny?

37:25.386 --> 37:26.525
I've been doing some checking.

37:26.675 --> 37:28.870
The Hammond family has a hunting lodge in the mountains.

37:28.921 --> 37:30.470
It's been in the family for 50 years.

37:31.044 --> 37:32.087
Guess what town it's in?

37:32.702 --> 37:33.529
Mazatzal.

37:34.033 --> 37:35.451
I'm going to take a drive out there tomorrow,

37:35.502 --> 37:36.342
take a look around.

37:36.625 --> 37:38.112
Don't know what I'll do if I find anything.

37:38.172 --> 37:41.990
It's never easy to charge a man a second time around for something he's

37:42.044 --> 37:43.286
already been acquitted of,

37:43.393 --> 37:45.929
but I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it...

37:46.262 --> 37:47.706
if I come to it.

37:52.018 --> 37:53.481
What do you think he's thinking right now?

37:55.766 --> 37:56.677
He's gloating.

37:58.412 --> 37:59.686
He's thinking about everything he did,

38:00.053 --> 38:01.525
everything he was willing to do.

38:02.347 --> 38:03.017
He's thinking about...

38:04.271 --> 38:05.256
how smart he is...

38:06.559 --> 38:07.529
how dumb we are.

38:09.899 --> 38:11.764
And he's hoping with all his might...

38:13.219 --> 38:16.584
that there really is no hell.

38:23.756 --> 38:25.306
No! No! God, no!

38:25.822 --> 38:28.124
Please, don't! No!

38:29.352 --> 38:30.870
God, please, no!

38:31.270 --> 38:33.257
No! Don't!

38:33.803 --> 38:34.702
No!

38:55.775 --> 38:56.662
Did you get your warrant?

38:57.539 --> 38:58.815
It's all public conservation land.

38:58.924 --> 38:59.998
The Hammonds donated it.

39:00.985 --> 39:01.585
What's that?

39:02.542 --> 39:03.574
Deer carcasses.

39:03.707 --> 39:05.106
They're buried all up and down these woods.

39:05.608 --> 39:06.534
Makes it hard going.

39:06.683 --> 39:07.834
The dogs are getting confused.

39:09.117 --> 39:10.222
You think he wants his land back?

39:10.401 --> 39:11.797
What in the hell is going on here?

39:11.848 --> 39:12.469
Mr. Hammond...

39:12.520 --> 39:13.295
What are you doing?

39:13.346 --> 39:15.046
My son-in-law was acquitted yesterday.

39:15.097 --> 39:17.370
Sir, we're only attempting to follow up on every lead...

39:17.421 --> 39:19.569
Why do you feel the need to continue this obsession,

39:19.620 --> 39:20.324
this harassment?

39:20.375 --> 39:22.398
My daughter fell out of a boat, not...

39:22.449 --> 39:24.024
- Please, Mr. Hammond...
- Detective!

39:27.528 --> 39:28.313
Excuse me.

39:34.527 --> 39:35.144
We got something.

39:39.224 --> 39:39.830
What is it?

39:46.486 --> 39:47.664
Oh, crap.

39:59.323 --> 40:00.450
That's Jessie's ring.

40:01.918 --> 40:04.694
Mr. Hammond, we should go inside and let the officers work...

40:05.991 --> 40:07.325
Oh, this bag's full of body parts.

40:09.146 --> 40:09.868
Mr. Hammond...

40:13.630 --> 40:15.061
One, two, three, four,

40:15.163 --> 40:16.894
I declare a thumb war.

40:17.851 --> 40:20.060
I win! I'm the champion of the world!

40:20.161 --> 40:21.404
Ha, ha, you lose.

40:21.455 --> 40:22.857
I'm the co-champion of the world!

40:25.509 --> 40:26.938
All right,
world champions!

40:27.781 --> 40:31.058
Daddy, are we all driving all together tomorrow?

40:31.557 --> 40:33.741
No, not tomorrow, sweetie.
Jury duty's over.

40:37.640 --> 40:40.038
So did you send somebody to jail,

40:40.379 --> 40:41.894
or did they not do it?

40:43.861 --> 40:44.741
I'll get that.

40:46.675 --> 40:48.157
Uh, well, he did do it...

40:48.921 --> 40:50.957
but no, he's not going to jail.
Not yet.

40:51.333 --> 40:52.574
But that doesn't make sense.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.245
It's complicated, sweetie.

40:54.641 --> 40:56.320
It's too complicated for 9:00.

40:57.802 --> 40:58.740
Now, everybody sleep.

40:59.687 --> 41:00.287
Night, Daddy.

41:00.857 --> 41:01.543
Night, Daddy.

41:09.206 --> 41:10.049
What? What's going on?

41:16.477 --> 41:17.632
I guess a couple hours ago,

41:18.082 --> 41:19.301
the father, Mr. Hammond,

41:19.630 --> 41:24.468
went into Devalos' office and... turned himself in.

41:25.450 --> 41:27.060
What? What are you talking about?
Turned himself in for what?

41:31.303 --> 41:34.934
Apparently, he drove his son-in-law Stephen up to the woods.

41:37.522 --> 41:39.089
He gave him a three-minute head start,

41:39.195 --> 41:40.480
then hunted him down...

41:41.648 --> 41:42.394
and shot him.

41:45.090 --> 41:46.534
He shot him 23 times.

41:59.891 --> 42:00.561
But I'm the champion!

42:00.656 --> 42:01.535
I beat Daddy!

42:02.010 --> 42:03.589
We're co-champions,
stupid.

42:03.812 --> 42:04.909
That means we're both champions.

42:05.255 --> 42:05.934
I'll get it.

42:06.096 --> 42:06.696
No, no...

42:06.728 --> 42:07.734
Nuh-uh.

42:09.111 --> 42:09.936
Nuh-uh.

42:09.997 --> 42:11.583
Hey, girls!
Come on, it's time for bed.

42:11.877 --> 42:12.890
I beat Daddy...

42:13.013 --> 42:14.423
