WEBVTT

00:56.473 --> 00:59.559
How could a soldier steal royal treasures

00:59.642 --> 01:02.062
just because the country is ruined?

01:02.145 --> 01:03.605
Goryeo will not fall.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.775
If you are truly a loyal man,

01:07.358 --> 01:09.194
do not stand in my way.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.153
General.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.663
IN 1388, YI SEONG-GYE
TURNED HIS ARMY AROUND IN WIHWADO

01:20.747 --> 01:23.833
GENERAL CHOE YEONG SENT
HIS MEN BUT WERE DEFEATED

01:23.917 --> 01:26.419
THUS THE LAST PILLAR OF GORYEO FELL

01:26.503 --> 01:30.548
GORYEO GENERALS WHO FELT THE THREAT
STOLE THE KINGDOM TREASURES

01:30.632 --> 01:33.218
AND FLED FAR OUT TO SEA

02:03.414 --> 02:04.666
I mean,

02:05.291 --> 02:07.418
I know that we're thieves…

02:07.502 --> 02:09.921
…but why are we being pursued as traitors?

02:10.004 --> 02:11.172
Well…

02:11.256 --> 02:12.841
…we did commit treason.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.553
What are you talking about?

02:17.053 --> 02:20.181
We'll be in the afterlife soon,
so I'll be truthful.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.227
Do you remember

02:25.145 --> 02:26.396
the Samcheok tree?

02:26.479 --> 02:29.107
Of course. I made this spoon out of it.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.651
-This one?
-I've never seen a tree like that.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.821
That was for the pillars
of the new palace.

02:36.656 --> 02:37.574
The pillars?

02:37.657 --> 02:40.285
The new palace in Gyeongbokgung.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.663
The one Yi Seong-gye's building
in Hanyang to make it to the capital?

02:44.247 --> 02:46.249
Yi Seong-gye searched all over the country

02:46.332 --> 02:49.210
to find wood for the pillars
to support Gyeongbokgung

02:49.294 --> 02:51.421
and found that tree
at the top of Taebaeksan.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.715
The one we stole in Gwangnaru?

02:53.798 --> 02:54.924
How'd it taste?

02:55.842 --> 02:57.927
Eating with the pillars of Gyeongbokgung?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.470
Good?

02:59.554 --> 03:01.848
The reason they stopped
building Gyeongbokgung…

03:01.931 --> 03:03.349
It's all…

03:05.518 --> 03:08.188
because of this spoon.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.105
Why?

03:10.148 --> 03:11.232
Why did you do it?

03:12.317 --> 03:13.943
Probably not just to eat with it?

03:14.027 --> 03:18.656
Are the pillars of a thousand-year dynasty
supposed to be a tree or the people?

03:20.033 --> 03:23.328
His vision never included
what was right in front of his eyes.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.871
Really got on my nerves.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.373
So because it got on your nerves--

03:27.457 --> 03:30.126
You made thousands of soldiers
chase after us.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.837
They're probably still after us.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.255
You're laughing?

03:34.339 --> 03:35.715
Dammit! Let me go!

03:35.798 --> 03:37.926
If I die, will my thirst die as well?

03:38.843 --> 03:41.346
I'll go a day early
to save you all seats when I get there.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.389
I'll cut off your head!

03:44.474 --> 03:46.017
-Oh get off!
-Let me go.

03:47.810 --> 03:48.770
Let me go!

03:49.354 --> 03:50.772
Let me go!

03:55.985 --> 03:58.196
So they've come, at last.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.782
They've come to take me.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.787
Are you a woman
who lives in the land of the gods?

04:08.039 --> 04:10.625
How can someone be so beautiful?

04:13.002 --> 04:15.964
That I should have to die
to meet my destiny.

04:18.007 --> 04:18.925
Here.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.177
Take me with you.

04:34.691 --> 04:35.566
Get up.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.571
Leave me alone.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.907
You're not getting up?

04:42.991 --> 04:44.742
THREE MONTHS AFTER THE RESCUE

04:44.826 --> 04:45.660
One.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.871
Two.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.543
Let me put on some clothes first.

04:54.168 --> 04:57.964
Captain, how long are we keeping
these bandits on our ship?

04:58.047 --> 04:59.215
They're extremely lazy.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.926
They poop anywhere they like,
the disgusting, dirty bastards.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.262
I have no idea what kind of ship this is.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.597
Is it a pirate ship?

05:07.557 --> 05:08.850
Are you pirates or fishermen?

05:08.933 --> 05:12.145
And if they're pirates,
why only attack Japanese pirates?

05:12.228 --> 05:14.897
You must attack merchant ships
for the money to feast on meat.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.275
We're like the Joseon navy,
only attacking the Japanese.

05:17.358 --> 05:18.192
-Exactly!
-Ugh.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.071
Getting sick just from looking at seafood.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.198
Ugh. Filthy.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.366
Who did that?

05:26.576 --> 05:29.370
Who threw precious food on the deck?

05:29.454 --> 05:31.164
She asked
who threw food on the deck.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.415
Who? It was you.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.960
I've had it
with these ungrateful bastards!

05:36.044 --> 05:38.004
-Get over here, you thieving scums!
-Go on!

05:38.087 --> 05:39.589
-Thieving scum.
-You did it. It was you.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.506
Go on. Hurry up.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.675
Come here. Now!

05:44.802 --> 05:46.179
Uh, I'm a pirate.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.222
-Never see you before.
-This is my fifth day.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.766
-Dismissed!
-Yes, sir.

05:52.852 --> 05:53.853
Something funny?

05:56.105 --> 05:58.358
Bandits, come here.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.070
Come here!

06:04.697 --> 06:07.033
-Come here!
-Yeah. I didn't think so.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.618
Come here!

06:09.452 --> 06:10.411
Come here!

06:11.079 --> 06:11.954
Come here!

06:12.038 --> 06:13.373
-Come here!
-Come here!

06:13.456 --> 06:15.708
Japanese pirates!
Japanese pirates on the horizon!

06:15.792 --> 06:17.668
Japanese pirates on the horizon!

06:18.252 --> 06:20.588
Japanese pirate ship?

06:21.714 --> 06:24.050
Woohoo! Yeah!

06:24.133 --> 06:27.303
Hey! They look pretty rich
for a Japanese pirate ship!

06:27.387 --> 06:30.098
Huh? We'll be eating meat soon enough.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.142
Captain, I'll cook you
the world's most delicious steak.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.019
Let's slowly grill the beef over the fire.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.729
And we'll feast on boiled pork!

06:42.026 --> 06:44.404
Black clouds. Strong winds.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.407
It's perfect weather for sword-fighting.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.033
Black clouds and strong winds?

06:49.617 --> 06:52.453
Hey. Do you even know how
to use a sword? Huh?

06:52.537 --> 06:54.372
Ah, you've heard of me.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.874
Up until now,
I've only dried squid, but trust me,

06:56.958 --> 07:00.670
on the mainland, they call me
Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman!

07:04.298 --> 07:06.050
I guess we'll see about that.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.554
Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman?

07:11.013 --> 07:11.973
Out of my way!

07:13.349 --> 07:15.852
All right! The time has finally come!

07:15.935 --> 07:20.440
Today, we bandits
will stand on the frontline!

07:21.524 --> 07:24.485
You pirates stay here
and prepare to feast on the meat!

07:29.949 --> 07:31.117
Mu-chi!

07:31.826 --> 07:33.411
Stop all your bragging and come down!

07:33.494 --> 07:34.996
Don't worry about me.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.873
And build the fire, my lady.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.249
I mean, Captain.

07:40.668 --> 07:41.544
Come on!

07:41.627 --> 07:43.296
Let's go!

07:44.172 --> 07:46.757
Full speed ahead!

07:46.841 --> 07:48.843
Come on! Come on!

07:58.603 --> 08:00.646
Perhaps it isn't a fishing boat?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.608
I'm sure it is a fishing boat.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.028
The best swordsman in Goryeo is coming!

08:09.655 --> 08:10.865
Hey, you bastards!

08:11.365 --> 08:13.326
And I suppose these are fishing rods?

08:14.118 --> 08:15.495
Pull!

08:16.329 --> 08:18.080
More! A bit more!

08:18.164 --> 08:19.540
Yes! Follow my lead!

08:20.583 --> 08:21.584
Go!

08:28.174 --> 08:29.175
Idiot.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.470
-Let's go!
-Hold on!

08:33.054 --> 08:34.388
We don't need help from pirates!

08:34.472 --> 08:36.140
We do need help, Captain!

08:36.682 --> 08:38.184
Please, help us!

08:49.487 --> 08:51.322
-Lend me your sword.
-Damn it.

08:51.405 --> 08:52.823
Help!

08:55.493 --> 08:56.619
Whoo.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.539
I'll have an easier time fighting
without those guys getting in the way.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.165
Kill him!

09:17.932 --> 09:19.058
Amazing.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.029
Mu-chi!

09:37.285 --> 09:39.453
Let's see what you can do, Mu-chi.

09:41.163 --> 09:41.998
You're laughing?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.625
I'm holding a sword.

09:46.502 --> 09:47.461
Oh.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.870
Goryeo's Greatest Swordman.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.915
Amazing!

10:24.999 --> 10:26.917
Amazing! Truly amazing!

10:27.001 --> 10:27.960
Shut up!

10:30.755 --> 10:32.465
These waters belong to Joseon.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.468
Because you have plundered in our waters,

10:35.551 --> 10:37.553
I will be taking that plunder back.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.265
This is ours…

10:41.349 --> 10:44.477
Yours… Ours…

10:45.728 --> 10:49.523
We are sea-faring folk
who follow the current.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.485
We make no distinction
between our waters and your waters.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.363
Done?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.993
They say these are their waters too.

11:01.077 --> 11:01.994
What?

11:02.078 --> 11:03.412
That's a bit short.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.664
That's all, Captain.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.916
I lived on a Japanese pirate ship
until I was ten.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.213
These

11:12.963 --> 11:14.382
are all your waters?

11:14.465 --> 11:16.967
All yours?

11:17.051 --> 11:19.345
You idiot.
That's not what I said--

11:19.428 --> 11:20.388
Shut up!

11:23.432 --> 11:26.560
He's saying the entire sea is theirs!

11:27.812 --> 11:28.813
Captain.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.942
I looked everywhere,
but there isn't any meat.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.945
There isn't even anything like chicken?

11:36.028 --> 11:37.905
Hey. I have no idea.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.241
All this crew eats is pickled fish.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.665
Please spare us!

11:49.792 --> 11:51.335
We're just…

11:51.419 --> 11:52.628
Shut up!

11:53.295 --> 11:56.632
We just came here in search of treasure.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.719
A huge stash of gold and silver…

11:59.802 --> 12:00.886
I'll kill you!

12:05.224 --> 12:06.392
What did he say?

12:06.934 --> 12:07.768
Oh.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.271
He… he says they're on a search for

12:10.771 --> 12:12.273
an enormous stash of treasure.

12:13.858 --> 12:14.734
Treasure?

12:17.236 --> 12:19.905
Boy, tell me. Where's this treasure?

12:20.823 --> 12:22.867
Where's the treasure?

12:30.958 --> 12:31.792
Me?

12:38.257 --> 12:41.177
This looks like the maps they use
in Goryeo military camps.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.304
Yeah. It is.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.722
I used ones just like this.

12:44.805 --> 12:45.848
"Joo Bang."

12:46.557 --> 12:47.850
General Joo Bang,

12:47.933 --> 12:50.060
who led the Goryeo Imperial Guard?

12:50.144 --> 12:50.978
That Joo Bang?

12:51.061 --> 12:54.815
The one who swept up the treasure
of the imperial family and disappeared?

12:56.358 --> 12:59.028
You mean
this is General Joo Bang's treasure map?

12:59.111 --> 13:00.905
They said it's Joo Bang's treasure.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.448
We could eat meat!

13:04.200 --> 13:05.576
Quiet! Quiet.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.245
Why you little…
How dare you tell us to be quiet!

13:11.624 --> 13:13.292
Captain, let's do it.

13:13.375 --> 13:17.004
If we get this treasure, we'll never have
to look at another damn squid ever again.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.259
Oh, please, please.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.261
Huh?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.724
It's treasure. Treasure!

13:30.768 --> 13:32.269
-Please?
-Huh?

13:35.189 --> 13:36.232
Okay!

13:38.692 --> 13:39.944
Let's raise our sails.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.250
Let's go!

14:16.188 --> 14:18.315
So I see
the dragon's daughter is at a loss

14:18.399 --> 14:19.984
when it comes to being on land.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.778
Oh, here. Look, it's right here.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.114
Don't tell me you can't see it.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.740
Seriously…

14:26.824 --> 14:27.908
Come on!

14:29.994 --> 14:32.830
The dragon is master of the sea,
but the tiger wins on land.

14:32.913 --> 14:33.747
Uh…

14:38.711 --> 14:39.545
Right!

14:40.170 --> 14:42.256
You'll follow me from now on!

14:42.339 --> 14:43.632
Let's go!

14:44.717 --> 14:46.135
Greet your guests!

14:46.218 --> 14:49.555
Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman,
Wu Mu-chi, and his men have arrived!

14:50.890 --> 14:52.516
What was that?

14:53.475 --> 14:54.351
What was that?

14:55.102 --> 14:55.936
What?

15:00.024 --> 15:01.400
What the hell did he yell at?

15:01.483 --> 15:03.110
Over there! Over there!

15:05.154 --> 15:06.196
You saw it!

15:06.280 --> 15:07.489
A cow!

15:07.573 --> 15:08.490
Do you see it?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.491
A cow!

15:09.575 --> 15:12.995
Looks like the meat
is coming to greet us first!

15:15.122 --> 15:18.167
Before finding the treasure,
let's fill our bellies!

15:18.876 --> 15:20.961
Stop! Do not act out of line.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.297
Head to the tunnel!

15:24.882 --> 15:26.216
Come on!

15:30.804 --> 15:32.765
Cows! Cows! Cows!

15:35.768 --> 15:38.020
-No! Come back!
-Turn around!

15:38.103 --> 15:39.021
No! Come back!

15:40.564 --> 15:41.398
Why?

15:46.654 --> 15:48.030
Get out of the way!

15:52.826 --> 15:53.702
Turn around!

16:01.710 --> 16:02.962
What's happening?

16:32.574 --> 16:34.743
Boss!

16:39.832 --> 16:40.749
Why?

16:41.750 --> 16:44.128
He was too full of himself…

16:47.047 --> 16:50.718
He died such a sudden death
after living such a lowly life.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.845
Leaving behind only his spoon.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.472
Captain.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.474
We should go.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.626
Captain, look!
Look! Look over there!

17:24.710 --> 17:25.836
How did he survive?

17:30.299 --> 17:32.885
Look who's back, huh?

17:34.678 --> 17:37.097
Here. Your hand.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.560
Kang-seop.

17:41.643 --> 17:42.478
Kang-seop.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.232
Now I understand
why there's a tusk drawn on the map.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.609
This is the real treasure map.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.195
Let us return to the ship and feast.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.863
Yes, Captain.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.406
A treasure map. A treasure map.

17:59.286 --> 18:02.539
Why would you enter the cave
when there's a herd of cows coming?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.293
I'm injured too.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.878
Honestly, unbelievable.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.505
I had a bad feeling about that cave.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.256
Who's making
that damn whiny noise?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.384
You thieves, listen here!

18:16.178 --> 18:18.013
I said we're honest bandits.

18:20.682 --> 18:23.352
I took you in because I pitied
how you all fled to sea

18:23.435 --> 18:25.729
after being branded as traitors to Goryeo.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.982
But I didn't think
you'd stick around with us.

18:29.483 --> 18:33.320
Seeing how fat you've grown since then,

18:33.403 --> 18:35.614
I think the time has come to tell you.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.199
Are you telling us to leave?

18:38.617 --> 18:39.451
Listen!

18:41.036 --> 18:43.497
From this moment on, on my ship,

18:44.540 --> 18:46.041
only pirates can sail with us.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.751
Pirate!

18:49.545 --> 18:51.213
And if a bandit becomes a pirate?

18:51.296 --> 18:52.422
Then I'll accept him.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.884
Kang-seop, as you're second-in-command,
I'll name you as first mate with A-gwi.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.010
Captain!

19:00.222 --> 19:01.974
Are we pirates now too?

19:02.474 --> 19:03.517
This will be good.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.398
Hey!

19:10.232 --> 19:13.819
Hey. Who said you could name him
as your first mate, huh?

19:13.902 --> 19:15.821
Wu Mu-chi, I will…

19:17.239 --> 19:18.699
make you my quartermaster.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.705
You'll make me your underling?

19:25.414 --> 19:28.250
Wu Mu-chi, Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman?

19:28.333 --> 19:30.460
Just as the sea has only one Dragon King,

19:30.544 --> 19:32.546
a pirate crew can have only one captain.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.381
You're not just trying to play queen bee?

19:34.965 --> 19:36.884
Watch what you say, Quartermaster.

19:36.967 --> 19:37.801
Be careful.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.178
Don't call me quartermaster!

19:39.261 --> 19:41.471
Take a second
to look at your bandits, Mu-chi!

19:41.972 --> 19:45.559
Every day is like a war, balanced
on the line between life and death.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.479
You cannot lead a group if you
confuse them with two different orders.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.481
You telling me to go?

19:52.399 --> 19:53.692
If that's what you want.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.491
Listen to me!

20:03.744 --> 20:06.038
I'm abandoning the ship and staying here.

20:07.039 --> 20:07.915
Look there!

20:08.749 --> 20:10.459
The path by sea is unclear.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.175
Who will walk the righteous path with me?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.930
It's fine. Stay seated.
You're staying here with me anyway.

20:23.013 --> 20:23.889
Don't get sick.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.977
-I'm coming too.
-Beats being a bandit.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.439
Let's go!

20:33.065 --> 20:36.860
Those who follow me are known
as pirates from here on out.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.362
Take care.

20:38.987 --> 20:41.281
Is there really no one who will follow me?

20:42.407 --> 20:44.243
One, two. One, two.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.247
Those…

20:49.539 --> 20:51.333
Look at those disloyal morons, huh?

20:51.917 --> 20:55.379
Kang-seop, you stand
for what a bandit should stand for.

20:55.462 --> 20:58.674
-For what is a bandit? Those united by--
-Thank you for everything, boss.

20:58.757 --> 21:02.052
Take care of yourself
and watch out for soldiers.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.679
You'd… Hang on, Kang-seop!

21:06.932 --> 21:08.976
-Come on, man.
-Hurry up!

21:09.059 --> 21:10.602
-Wait for me!
-Come on. It's you and me!

21:10.686 --> 21:12.437
Now, Wu Mu-chi--

21:12.521 --> 21:14.273
I said wait for me!

21:14.356 --> 21:15.190
Kang-seop.

21:15.983 --> 21:16.942
Stay here!

21:17.025 --> 21:18.235
Come back here!

21:19.111 --> 21:21.029
-Come back here!
-Wait!

21:21.113 --> 21:22.614
One, two!

21:23.198 --> 21:24.783
Go on, then! Go!

21:25.701 --> 21:27.244
Good riddance!

21:27.953 --> 21:29.997
Good riddance!

21:55.897 --> 21:58.317
I'd heard that you killed
the leader of Jurchen in Kuju.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.526
YI BANG-WON

21:59.609 --> 22:01.611
It appears that was true.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.032
The throne, you say?

22:05.741 --> 22:09.870
So you think I took command of a few
hundred soldiers just to take the throne?

22:10.370 --> 22:12.164
You don't have enough men for that

22:12.789 --> 22:14.624
and, also, they seem unprepared.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.254
You are the real traitor.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.049
I appreciate it, you remembering that.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.468
Just come out with it.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.555
Prosperity.

22:28.638 --> 22:32.184
One does not claim the throne
through rank but rather with power.

22:32.267 --> 22:36.646
You can have an army with wealth,
and with an army comes power.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.191
I don't have wealth, I must admit.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.485
If I told you there was a hidden treasure,

22:42.944 --> 22:44.112
will you take it?

22:49.326 --> 22:51.370
Now this is a pirate ale!

22:54.998 --> 22:55.999
Hey. Give it here.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.419
The treasure
is now within our hands!

23:00.796 --> 23:02.756
Well, I wonder if he ate anything.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.967
Shall I go
and quietly bring him back here?

23:07.469 --> 23:10.347
If he wanted to come,
he would have swum here already.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.108
I'm so full.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.116
Man…

23:29.199 --> 23:30.242
Captain!

23:31.493 --> 23:33.495
The elephant tusk is gone!

23:33.578 --> 23:35.205
What? What is gone?

23:35.288 --> 23:37.749
-The elephant tusk is gone!
-Who did this?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.543
Who do you think did it?

23:40.502 --> 23:43.004
Ugh. That dirty, thieving bastard!

23:43.588 --> 23:45.799
I can't believe I ever called him boss.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.259
Dammit!

23:48.385 --> 23:50.303
Wu Mu-chi!

23:55.308 --> 23:58.311
Wu Mu-chi,
I'm going to kill you if I ever catch you!

23:59.020 --> 24:01.440
Why do you think
he left us his location?

24:01.523 --> 24:02.482
That idiot.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.693
Hold on. Is this a trap?

24:05.235 --> 24:06.278
A trap?

24:07.487 --> 24:09.614
I've known him a long time.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.324
He's not that cunning. Trust me.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.537
What is this growling?

24:16.496 --> 24:18.206
What else
will growl like that?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.791
It has to be a tiger.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.418
A tiger?

24:26.673 --> 24:29.050
Run away!

24:38.268 --> 24:39.102
Rang?

24:41.271 --> 24:44.983
-Is this real, or a dream?
-I'm going to kill you, you damn thief!

24:45.066 --> 24:48.778
-It would be nice if it weren't a dream.
-I'm going to kill you!

24:50.906 --> 24:52.073
That hurt!

24:52.157 --> 24:53.617
Ow!

24:53.700 --> 24:55.285
-Get up!
-Wait! Wait a moment!

24:59.623 --> 25:00.749
Why did you return?

25:01.666 --> 25:03.043
Did you miss me already?

25:06.338 --> 25:09.424
Are you proud of your thievery
because you're originally a thief?

25:10.634 --> 25:13.345
Hey, Hae-rang. I told you I'm honest.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.056
All right, wait. Just wait.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.350
Listen to me.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.852
Who discovered the tusk?

25:20.936 --> 25:22.270
I discovered it, but you--

25:23.939 --> 25:25.482
You call it thievery.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.193
Yeah. I only have
a couple things to say to you.

25:28.276 --> 25:29.110
Hmm.

25:29.194 --> 25:32.739
One, you should die for the crime
of stealing from your brothers.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.241
I'm the one that found it.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.285
Two, simply return the tusk to me
and I won't kill you.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.705
What an impressive threat.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.707
Did you forget? Greatest swordsman.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.126
-Even a crying tiger--
-Please stop!

25:47.629 --> 25:50.423
Never say the "ger" in tiger
in front of me again.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.982
Hey! Hey! Wait!

26:07.607 --> 26:08.900
Stop!

26:16.408 --> 26:18.702
You're really trying to kill me! Dammit!

26:36.052 --> 26:37.554
Give me the tusk.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.349
-I don't have it.
-Really?

26:50.191 --> 26:51.943
Answer honestly and I'll tell you.

26:54.821 --> 26:57.949
Did you find me because of the tusk,

26:58.700 --> 26:59.993
or because you missed me?

27:03.997 --> 27:06.333
Mak-yi took it.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.545
Boss.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.757
The tusk?

27:14.299 --> 27:15.216
Thief!

27:19.095 --> 27:22.015
What, were you planning to find
the treasure and keep it all to yourself?

27:23.183 --> 27:25.185
-Do I look that dishonorable?
-Then what?

27:27.854 --> 27:30.106
Soon she'll come to find me
and beg me on her knees.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.317
Who? Captain Hae-rang?

27:34.819 --> 27:37.656
So your plan
is to use the tusk as leverage

27:37.739 --> 27:39.449
to get your position back as boss?

27:39.532 --> 27:40.950
Tell me,

27:41.534 --> 27:44.371
why bring a blanket
if you're planning on going back anyway?

27:44.454 --> 27:45.830
I wasn't thinking straight.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.584
Now that we've sailed here together,

27:49.668 --> 27:51.586
our fates are linked, huh?

27:53.880 --> 27:55.757
There are soldiers
in every direction here.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.758
-Soldiers?
-Yeah.

27:56.841 --> 27:59.219
Since you know the mountains now,
you climb to the peak first.

27:59.302 --> 28:00.136
To the peak?

28:00.220 --> 28:02.722
And if the coast is clear,
strike your flint.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.557
Clack, clack twice.

28:05.308 --> 28:07.435
-Twice.
-And I'll follow with the baggage.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.062
Mm-hmm.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.063
Right.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.231
-Right.
-Right.

28:11.314 --> 28:12.399
-You're right.
-Okay.

28:13.900 --> 28:14.776
Uh-uh.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.488
Leave this to your subordinate.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.534
Boss, you need to focus
on the bigger stuff, not chores.

28:23.910 --> 28:24.786
You…

28:25.954 --> 28:27.539
Mak-yi, a subordinate?

28:29.165 --> 28:30.208
Upon my return,

28:31.084 --> 28:32.377
you're my quartermaster.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.629
-Yes, boss.
-Yeah.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.843
How many strikes?

28:41.761 --> 28:42.762
-Twice.
-Twice.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.097
Right. Go on, quickly.

28:44.889 --> 28:47.058
You got this.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.268
Go on, quickly!

28:51.438 --> 28:53.440
-Go. Go on.
-Right.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.235
To the left.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.032
Chump.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.118
So naïve.

29:07.620 --> 29:08.747
That night,

29:09.289 --> 29:11.499
I kept striking the flint all night long.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.418
Idiot.

29:14.627 --> 29:17.881
Starting to feel
like all you pirates are like that.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.382
No more self-pity.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.179
The rumor is spreading
that Wu Mu-chi is selling the tusk.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.015
It has already spread even across the sea.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.017
Mak-yi, son of a--

29:29.100 --> 29:30.268
BYEOKRANDO

29:30.351 --> 29:32.479
-You can't go in there!
-Out of my way!

29:32.562 --> 29:34.522
I'm so sorry, sir.
He just burst his way in.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.483
I've come because I have a rare item.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.652
I am Wu Mu-chi,
Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.322
The one with Hae-rang? That Wu Mu-chi?

29:44.532 --> 29:46.493
I'm embarrassed
that you know my humble history.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.369
After conquering the vast ocean,

29:48.953 --> 29:51.664
I cared for Hae-rang
just like a sworn sister.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.043
Let me introduce.

29:57.378 --> 29:58.254
Who?

30:00.256 --> 30:01.424
Hae-rang.

30:02.550 --> 30:03.635
Who is?

30:05.178 --> 30:06.012
I am?

30:09.682 --> 30:11.851
Only 10,000 nyang.

30:13.311 --> 30:16.272
Only 10,000 nyang for an elephant tooth?

30:18.566 --> 30:20.360
It's what that legend is about.

30:20.443 --> 30:21.569
What legend?

30:24.781 --> 30:27.450
It was a day when lightning
struck the Kingdom of Goryeo.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.786
Yi Seong-gye
turned back his army from Wihwado.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.038
General Choe was defeated.
There was no other choice.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.414
However,

30:33.498 --> 30:35.208
they say, even as the country was in ruin,

30:35.291 --> 30:37.544
there was a great general
who made plans for the future.

30:37.627 --> 30:40.880
He took the gold from the Royal Treasury
and Office of Internal Affairs.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.091
He wouldn't cede the kingdom
to Yi Seong-gye.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.635
And using the treasure
his military would rebuild Goryeo.

30:48.972 --> 30:49.806
W-what?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.267
I'm hearing this for the first time.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.560
Of course, you are.

30:55.270 --> 30:57.564
Everybody who knows the secret has died.

30:58.565 --> 31:02.610
You have before you the treasure map
that leads to that royal treasure.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.113
The one that disappeared.

31:06.781 --> 31:09.117
Now you must show us

31:09.617 --> 31:12.120
your boldness
that makes a mockery of 10,000 nyang.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.293
10,000 nyang
for an elephant tooth.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.712
You should take it.
You will not regret it.

31:20.795 --> 31:21.796
Out of the way!

31:25.216 --> 31:26.467
You son of a--

31:29.387 --> 31:30.889
Kang-seop, damn you!

31:31.472 --> 31:32.473
What are you doing?

31:33.057 --> 31:33.892
What's going on?

31:33.975 --> 31:35.894
Oh, Captain. Damn it. What do I do?

31:35.977 --> 31:37.228
This bastard.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.772
How… How did you…

31:40.273 --> 31:41.649
You look so extravagant.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.777
Yes, yes. I was just about
to take that… Yes?

31:45.778 --> 31:47.155
So this is, uh…

31:47.238 --> 31:51.034
Wait. So this must be the girl
you said was your sworn sister.

31:52.118 --> 31:55.538
You said you couldn't stand her because
she was too stubborn and hot-tempered.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.042
Captain, please…

31:59.500 --> 32:01.711
Please just kill me!

32:01.794 --> 32:03.171
That I will.

32:04.797 --> 32:05.757
And you are?

32:07.008 --> 32:09.677
Well, I'm the last princess
of the Kingdom of Goryeo--

32:09.761 --> 32:11.262
Tie them up together!

32:12.180 --> 32:13.806
A princess? How dare you!

32:14.849 --> 32:17.477
Hey! Okay. You saw that? Untie me!

32:17.560 --> 32:19.896
-You're tying me up too? How dare you!
-Wait.

32:19.979 --> 32:22.106
-Aren't you gonna untie me?
-Pipe down!

32:22.607 --> 32:26.277
Everything we have,
we earned with the blood of our brothers.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.446
But Wu Mu-chi broke
and discarded that loyalty,

32:28.529 --> 32:30.740
and colluded with Mak-yi,
who recently joined us.

32:30.823 --> 32:33.159
It wasn't c-collusion, I was kidnapped!

32:33.242 --> 32:35.787
Don't interrupt the captain
while she's delivering her judgment!

32:35.870 --> 32:36.871
Say your last words!

32:38.331 --> 32:41.960
-My lady, as the last princess of Goryeo--
-I'll judge you separately.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.629
-Such impudence.
-Who is she anyway?

32:44.712 --> 32:45.880
Gom-chi.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.173
Gom-chi!

32:47.256 --> 32:49.676
Captain, don't! Please!

32:50.301 --> 32:53.763
Not only have I not married yet,
I haven't even held a woman's hand!

32:56.015 --> 32:58.351
So--

33:02.855 --> 33:05.441
Gom-chi, Gom-chi, Gom-chi!

33:05.525 --> 33:07.860
I… I was born on a Japanese pirate ship

33:07.944 --> 33:10.863
and was abused for ten years
just because I wasfrom Joseon.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.365
My mother and I fled together.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.076
Too bad you were captured
by a slave-trader ship.

33:16.244 --> 33:19.038
I spent another ten years
being abused there!

33:20.039 --> 33:22.458
And even lost my mother.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.043
Gom-chi…

33:25.962 --> 33:27.213
I'll go first!

33:28.006 --> 33:30.675
A true boss
does not let the subordinate go first.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.677
Ooh.

33:33.594 --> 33:36.222
That's the first time
you've said anything like a boss!

33:37.223 --> 33:38.891
I'll send you first.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.039
Come on!

34:06.002 --> 34:07.920
Whoo!

34:18.723 --> 34:20.349
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:21.309 --> 34:22.268
Come on.

34:26.439 --> 34:27.690
Everyone, stop!

34:28.357 --> 34:30.109
Especially you! Archer, don't you move!

34:31.069 --> 34:33.321
Lower your bow!
I said lower your bow, dammit!

34:35.615 --> 34:37.200
Your captain promised me!

34:37.283 --> 34:40.119
She said she would spare me
if I gave her the tusk!

34:40.870 --> 34:41.704
Didn't you?

34:41.788 --> 34:44.082
I did, but that tusk
already belongs to us.

34:44.665 --> 34:45.500
Oh yeah?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.211
You sure? It's in my hands now.

34:48.294 --> 34:51.130
On the other hand,
you want it in the Dragon King's hands.

34:51.798 --> 34:53.382
No!

34:58.012 --> 34:58.846
Stop!

34:59.514 --> 35:00.598
I'll let it go!

35:01.182 --> 35:02.558
I'll really drop it!

35:06.979 --> 35:07.939
Hmm.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.444
Give it.

35:13.528 --> 35:14.362
Hae-rang,

35:15.488 --> 35:16.697
Were you really gonna kill me?

35:16.781 --> 35:17.990
Hmm.

35:20.701 --> 35:23.871
Well, I knew you weren't going to die
because you were hiding a knife.

35:29.418 --> 35:30.253
You saw that?

35:36.134 --> 35:38.136
I see a man who cries then laughs.

35:42.056 --> 35:45.184
Just as I thought,
you're prettiest when you're being mean.

35:53.234 --> 35:54.318
Save me!

35:55.236 --> 35:56.821
Save me!

36:01.200 --> 36:04.537
Let's run away, boss.
I can't live as a slave any longer.

36:05.913 --> 36:09.250
You'd be a quartermaster now
if you hadn't betrayed me.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.421
-You should've struck the flint properly.
-You!

36:15.631 --> 36:18.217
I struck the flint
until I got blisters on my hands.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.805
You should've struck it
until until the blisters burst!

36:22.889 --> 36:24.432
You… you shut your mouth!

36:24.515 --> 36:27.268
-Mister, they're messing around.
-Get off me!

36:35.651 --> 36:40.031
Quartermaster, how do you know the
Goryeo military way of cracking the code?

36:41.032 --> 36:43.826
I told you. I was the last warrior
of the Kindgom of Goryeo.

36:43.910 --> 36:47.288
Dogs and cows claim
to be the last warrior as well.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.917
If you gather all of them,
you'd have a million soldiers.

36:51.000 --> 36:51.959
Dogs and cows?

36:54.045 --> 36:54.879
Get on with it!

36:55.755 --> 36:56.714
That's it.

36:58.507 --> 36:59.842
Let me see what's written.

37:02.678 --> 37:03.554
Dammit.

37:04.305 --> 37:05.431
It's a code.

37:06.766 --> 37:09.810
It's an old military cipher
only used by Goryeo officers.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.313
Were you a private?

37:13.356 --> 37:14.899
Private Last Warrior?

37:17.693 --> 37:19.528
Private The Very Bottom.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.739
What have you found out?

37:21.822 --> 37:23.366
I searched for General Joo Bang,

37:23.449 --> 37:24.951
starting with those who died in battle

37:25.534 --> 37:27.161
from the Office of Internal Affairs.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.830
Three things disappeared that day.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.458
First was General Joo Bang.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.544
Second was the treasure
of the imperial family of Goryeo

37:36.504 --> 37:38.214
And the last…

37:38.297 --> 37:39.924
… was Joo Bang's wife.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.511
Of course, Joo Bang
must have had someone backing him.

37:43.594 --> 37:44.720
Did you find his wife?

37:45.304 --> 37:46.472
She shaved her head…

37:46.555 --> 37:48.766
…and became a Buddhist nun.

37:48.849 --> 37:52.228
Goodness. You must have searched
every temple and hermitage in the country.

37:52.812 --> 37:53.729
What happened?

37:54.522 --> 37:56.649
Did she tell you where the treasure is?

38:00.403 --> 38:01.821
So, where…

38:03.489 --> 38:04.407
is it?

38:07.159 --> 38:08.160
"Haegildo"?

38:09.161 --> 38:12.832
"A sea cave beneath a rock
with no shadow."

38:12.915 --> 38:13.749
"Haegildo"?

38:14.333 --> 38:15.960
Isn't that the p-perilous sea route?

38:16.043 --> 38:18.337
The sea is the sea,
however perilous it is.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.506
-You don't know anything about it.
-There's treasure?

38:20.589 --> 38:21.424
The… the water goes--

38:21.507 --> 38:25.094
Hey! Since you've lived trapped on that
cramped land, you don't know anything.

38:25.177 --> 38:28.848
The whirlpools there,
they keep swirling, and…

38:30.016 --> 38:32.435
A river flows under the ocean!

38:34.312 --> 38:36.355
Poop is poop and farts are farts.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.482
How can a river flow under the sea?

38:38.566 --> 38:39.817
I'm telling you it flows!

38:40.401 --> 38:41.277
Why you little--

38:41.360 --> 38:42.611
It flows!

38:44.989 --> 38:46.991
-It flows, it flows.
-Forgive me.

38:47.491 --> 38:48.951
There's diarrhea too.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.329
The problem is that we don't know
how long the river is.

38:51.412 --> 38:53.956
In other words, no one's gone under
and come out the other end.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.667
Well, then I'm not going.
I give up. I give up.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.086
Captain, let's not go.

39:00.963 --> 39:02.757
-First mate!
-Yes?

39:03.674 --> 39:05.634
Bring the boat to shore
and catch ten pigs.

39:06.218 --> 39:07.595
Yes.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.639
Raise the sails!

39:23.152 --> 39:24.987
If what you're saying is true,

39:25.071 --> 39:27.615
it surely is
an amazing amount of treasure.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.034
What do you want in return?

39:31.327 --> 39:33.204
Become the king of Joseon.

39:40.044 --> 39:40.920
Yah!

39:41.796 --> 39:42.797
And you?

39:45.257 --> 39:47.176
I want to be the king of Tamna.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.071
Enjoy your trip, Boss!

40:07.154 --> 40:09.073
Bye!

40:11.200 --> 40:13.786
Oh no. What is that whirpool, huh?

40:14.870 --> 40:15.746
Whoa!

40:17.331 --> 40:20.167
There's no way of knowing
where the river under the sea ends.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.877
Do not let go of your pouch.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.006
Yah! Yah!

40:34.640 --> 40:36.725
You said we might die. Are you afraid?

40:37.643 --> 40:40.062
Someone so afraid shouldn't be a leader.

40:40.146 --> 40:41.147
Uh…

40:41.772 --> 40:45.276
A leader who's afraid can find a way
for us all to survive together.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.947
We're risking our lives
to survive together.

40:50.656 --> 40:52.116
Yeah. Sure.

40:56.996 --> 41:00.583
Captain, our boat will be swept away
if we go any closer to it.

41:00.666 --> 41:02.293
We'll ride the current from here!

41:02.376 --> 41:05.087
-Let's go!
-Yes, Captain!

41:07.548 --> 41:09.425
-Ugh. What's this smell?
-Go on!

41:11.385 --> 41:14.054
They're the pigs bladders
that you washed so earnestly.

41:14.638 --> 41:15.848
They're filled with air.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.978
-I thought it smelled like piss.
-I didn't wash mine thoroughly.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.522
I'm so scared, mister.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.735
No, don't!

41:30.571 --> 41:32.156
You go first.

41:32.239 --> 41:34.241
I can't make it.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.118
Hurry up and go, you bastard!

41:37.119 --> 41:40.080
Don't worry! I'll take care of the boat!

41:40.748 --> 41:42.333
Have a safe trip!

43:49.335 --> 43:50.210
Get up.

43:57.092 --> 43:58.302
Clench your teeth.

44:13.108 --> 44:13.942
Mak-yi?

44:21.700 --> 44:23.118
That stinks!

44:24.411 --> 44:26.789
Captain, it's not here either.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.918
Really?
Just where is the treasure.

44:31.001 --> 44:32.336
I mean, really.

44:32.419 --> 44:33.671
Captain!

44:33.754 --> 44:36.465
There isn't another path!
It's completely blocked off!

44:36.548 --> 44:37.633
Look harder!

44:37.716 --> 44:39.635
Captain, what's next?

44:39.718 --> 44:43.138
This is why I wanted to sell the map,
in case this happened.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.226
I thought Hae-rang would be different,

44:47.309 --> 44:50.229
but she's just the same as those fools
getting tricked by a fake map.

44:52.314 --> 44:54.733
-It's not here either?
-Ugh. I'm hungry!

44:54.817 --> 44:56.527
Hey. It's not there either?

44:57.027 --> 44:58.112
Hey. Gather around.

44:59.446 --> 45:01.990
Get over here, quickly!
He said gather around.

45:02.074 --> 45:05.577
I'm saying it because it came up.
If we had sold the map, where would we be?

45:05.661 --> 45:07.538
-Shut up!
-I'm not wrong.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.665
What should we do?
Should we check again?

45:09.748 --> 45:11.875
Okay, okay, okay.
What are you gonna do?

45:13.335 --> 45:15.379
They're all waiting for your next order.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.720
You risked our lives
bringing us here, hmm?

45:23.220 --> 45:26.557
Whether you give them despair or hope,

45:27.975 --> 45:30.018
the leader needs to take responsibility.

45:32.771 --> 45:35.607
Hey, Hae-rang. A leader must…

45:37.192 --> 45:38.610
must use their brain. Yeah?

45:38.694 --> 45:40.362
Huh? Did he…?

45:42.072 --> 45:44.408
How dare you touch the captain's head!

45:45.701 --> 45:47.995
-Watch closely.
-You bastard!

45:51.373 --> 45:52.583
What?

45:52.666 --> 45:53.876
What the hell is that?

45:53.959 --> 45:55.794
How will he kill him?

45:55.878 --> 45:57.755
Now you're a goner.

45:58.922 --> 46:00.466
You still think you're the boss.

46:02.009 --> 46:03.969
Too bad you don't have your sword.

46:04.052 --> 46:07.055
Never in my life have I lost a fistfight.

46:07.139 --> 46:08.223
Neither have I.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.935
Gom-chi!

46:16.356 --> 46:18.567
Such imeciles.

46:25.741 --> 46:28.827
I discovered this path
that was blocked by a stalactite.

46:29.661 --> 46:30.788
Captain,

46:32.206 --> 46:33.457
please go ahead.

46:44.176 --> 46:45.969
Hey. You upset?

46:46.553 --> 46:47.679
You all right?

46:51.475 --> 46:52.309
Whoo!

46:52.893 --> 46:53.727
Captain.

46:54.269 --> 46:55.103
What?

47:05.948 --> 47:08.450
You could by 100 rolls of silk
with just one of these.

47:08.534 --> 47:11.328
-It's enough to build ten palaces!
-I know!

47:14.164 --> 47:14.998
Move.

47:15.499 --> 47:16.917
-Hmm?
-Out of the way.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.502
He's acting all haughty again.

47:18.585 --> 47:20.504
I'm a bit disappointed.

47:20.587 --> 47:22.798
Why? I'm happy with it.

47:22.881 --> 47:24.591
Why are there only silver bottles?

47:25.384 --> 47:27.719
The royal treasure
should have gold pieces.

47:27.803 --> 47:28.720
Gold pieces?

47:28.804 --> 47:33.475
A box of these silver bottles
would be worth…

47:34.226 --> 47:35.352
one piece of gold.

47:36.478 --> 47:38.772
How many gold pieces should there be?

47:39.523 --> 47:42.109
About this big and this much.

47:42.693 --> 47:44.111
This much.

47:44.194 --> 47:45.195
This…

47:46.280 --> 47:49.575
It's said that it filled up the entire
Royal Treasury of Goryeo's palace.

47:49.658 --> 47:51.577
We must find the gold!

47:52.870 --> 47:54.329
Find the gold pieces!

47:55.455 --> 47:57.332
-Hurry!
-Over there!

47:58.750 --> 47:59.751
You aren't lying, are you?

48:00.335 --> 48:02.379
I'm honorable. I'm Wu Mu-chi.

48:05.549 --> 48:08.010
What is this?

48:08.594 --> 48:10.804
This isn't a flag they use
in military camps.

48:17.519 --> 48:20.105
At first glance,
it looks like the face of a goblin,

48:20.188 --> 48:21.690
but when you look at it up close…

48:21.773 --> 48:23.066
When you look at it up close?

48:25.235 --> 48:26.820
I have no idea.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.363
Get out of the way.

48:39.207 --> 48:40.334
It's an earthquake!

48:40.417 --> 48:42.252
Captain, it's an earthquake!

48:42.336 --> 48:45.088
A-gwi, Gom-chi, go back to the boat
and bring more rope.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.382
Yes, captain. Gom-chi, hurry! Follow me!

48:56.683 --> 48:58.185
Everyone, get back!

49:16.995 --> 49:18.163
Someone's here.

49:23.669 --> 49:24.920
Halt.

49:29.049 --> 49:30.008
Yes, sir.

49:41.311 --> 49:42.980
-Huh?
-Help move these.

49:44.439 --> 49:46.608
Wait. Isn't this a… a sea chart?

49:47.317 --> 49:49.236
What? A map?

49:49.319 --> 49:51.363
Joseon, Japan.

49:53.699 --> 49:54.992
And h-here is

49:55.492 --> 49:56.994
Inazuma Island.

49:57.077 --> 49:58.704
Inazu… w-what… zuma?

50:03.125 --> 50:04.209
Run back to the pond!

50:05.877 --> 50:07.295
Hurry up! Come on, quickly!

50:50.505 --> 50:52.549
-What about the captain?
-Still in the cave.

50:57.929 --> 50:58.764
What the…

51:16.073 --> 51:18.033
-You okay?
-Ah, it hurts, dammit!

51:30.879 --> 51:32.464
Captain! Captain!

51:37.511 --> 51:39.346
Get the captain out of here!

51:41.890 --> 51:42.933
Get them!

52:06.331 --> 52:07.666
Wu Mu-chi.

52:08.625 --> 52:10.418
You bandit scum!

52:25.100 --> 52:27.060
Officer Bu Heung-su of Tamna.

52:28.103 --> 52:31.022
Reporting the successful decapitation
of the enemy general.

52:48.582 --> 52:50.417
Prepare for battle!
We attack them at nightfall.

52:50.500 --> 52:51.501
Reporting!

52:53.587 --> 52:56.590
I have a direct order!
Evacuate the wounded and make camp.

52:56.673 --> 52:58.967
The enemy line is closeby.
We ambush them tonight and--

52:59.050 --> 53:00.135
It's an order!

53:00.218 --> 53:02.846
Evacuate the wounded first
and make camp--

53:05.807 --> 53:08.393
Deliver the message
that we have no wounded.

53:09.394 --> 53:12.439
There are only two kinds
of men in my unit.

53:12.522 --> 53:13.565
Fighting or dead.

53:14.149 --> 53:16.151
You marched on after killing the wounded?

53:17.694 --> 53:19.529
Isn't that how war is?

53:19.613 --> 53:22.073
You killed your own men
with your own hands?

53:23.491 --> 53:25.285
In exchange, I offer the general's head.

53:25.368 --> 53:27.579
His Majesty promised
to make you king of Tamna

53:27.662 --> 53:29.581
if you brought him
the enemy's head, correct?

53:29.664 --> 53:30.874
What of it?

53:30.957 --> 53:32.751
I won't allow a man like you
to become king.

53:32.834 --> 53:34.544
You'll be punished
according to military law.

53:34.628 --> 53:35.962
Arrest and bind him, now!

53:36.046 --> 53:37.214
Yes, sir!

53:37.297 --> 53:38.840
You dirty thief.

53:39.341 --> 53:41.509
You'll kill me
and take credit for my success?

53:42.093 --> 53:44.471
-Lower your sword.
-I don't intend to hand the credit to you!

54:00.987 --> 54:03.156
Again a mistake.

54:05.825 --> 54:07.369
So you need treasure, do you?

54:11.039 --> 54:12.332
Watch out!

54:15.293 --> 54:17.462
Another one goes in
for each step you take.

54:20.131 --> 54:22.801
Will you steal
what is mine, you aging thief?

54:23.718 --> 54:26.179
If you still covet
what is out of your reach.

54:28.723 --> 54:30.141
If not for you and your men,

54:30.725 --> 54:32.686
I would've already been a king.

54:34.479 --> 54:35.438
A king?

54:37.607 --> 54:40.360
How can someone
who's lower than a beast be a king?

54:40.443 --> 54:42.028
You can go to hell!

54:43.738 --> 54:44.906
Whoa, whoa!

54:44.990 --> 54:46.074
The treasure!

54:48.827 --> 54:50.078
Whoa!

54:51.454 --> 54:52.664
Captain!

55:37.542 --> 55:38.418
Sorry.

55:51.723 --> 55:53.350
Why aren't they coming up?

55:53.850 --> 55:55.810
Do you think something happened
to the captain?

55:55.894 --> 55:57.062
I better go down there.

55:57.145 --> 55:58.563
The rope!

56:00.190 --> 56:01.649
-Come on!
-Get them up!

56:02.150 --> 56:03.109
Pull!

57:47.547 --> 57:48.590
Captain!

57:51.009 --> 57:52.427
Boss!

58:02.353 --> 58:03.938
Thank you, Captain.

58:04.481 --> 58:05.899
Farewell, Boss.

58:06.399 --> 58:08.234
She's gone to a better place.

58:09.986 --> 58:11.696
Where did the sea chart go?

58:20.580 --> 58:21.789
Where's the captain?

58:23.458 --> 58:25.126
Where's the captain?

58:25.210 --> 58:26.753
Huh?

58:27.795 --> 58:28.630
Whoa!

58:36.971 --> 58:38.556
Not that way! This way, this way!

58:44.062 --> 58:45.855
Wait, wait! What about the silver?

58:45.939 --> 58:48.900
-The whale! The whale!
-Whale?

59:00.745 --> 59:02.705
No! Not this!

59:03.373 --> 59:05.500
Give us the treasure!

59:24.310 --> 59:25.562
What's that, Captain?

59:55.383 --> 59:56.759
It was a sea chart.

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:04.767
I thought I should sort
some of your things.

1:00:05.977 --> 1:00:08.021
Seems like you're stealing as well.

1:00:08.771 --> 1:00:11.566
I'm not stealing them,
I was just sorting them out.

1:00:11.649 --> 1:00:14.694
These just got all tangled together.

1:00:16.362 --> 1:00:17.530
How are you feeling, Captain?

1:00:17.614 --> 1:00:19.157
Thanks to you my head hurts now.

1:00:20.283 --> 1:00:23.536
These clothes
are really quite pretty, but strange.

1:00:24.245 --> 1:00:27.206
There are a lot of unusual things
in western seas.

1:00:27.290 --> 1:00:28.791
I'm the only woman on board,

1:00:28.875 --> 1:00:31.628
so everything I've gathered
is piled up in the storage.

1:00:32.295 --> 1:00:33.880
You can wear whatever you want.

1:00:37.425 --> 1:00:39.844
Then please get some rest.

1:00:41.554 --> 1:00:43.389
The things hanging from my belt,

1:00:44.432 --> 1:00:47.101
they were inherited
from brothers who've already died.

1:00:47.935 --> 1:00:49.520
They are my prized possessions.

1:00:52.315 --> 1:00:53.566
Oh dear.

1:00:54.317 --> 1:00:55.151
Oh crap.

1:01:01.908 --> 1:01:02.742
They're yours.

1:01:07.413 --> 1:01:08.748
I pledge my loyalty--

1:01:08.831 --> 1:01:10.083
What loyalty?

1:01:10.833 --> 1:01:12.919
We find ourselves in the same situation.

1:01:13.002 --> 1:01:14.796
That's why we should be honest
with each other.

1:01:15.380 --> 1:01:18.675
I hope you realize
that you can depend on us.

1:01:19.592 --> 1:01:20.677
Don't struggle on your own.

1:01:26.432 --> 1:01:29.519
What does it matter
between two thieving women?

1:01:32.021 --> 1:01:33.815
These just keep falling
out of nowhere.

1:01:35.358 --> 1:01:37.610
What are you doing? The sun's up.

1:01:38.528 --> 1:01:40.822
Do-mi, you better stop drinking so much.

1:01:55.503 --> 1:01:56.421
You okay?

1:02:00.591 --> 1:02:01.426
What?

1:02:03.094 --> 1:02:05.763
Do you love treasure that much?
You could've died out there.

1:02:07.181 --> 1:02:08.891
We all wanted it, Mu-chi.

1:02:10.143 --> 1:02:12.437
It's worth it,
even if getting it means risking my life.

1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:14.731
What will you do with it once you have it?

1:02:14.814 --> 1:02:15.732
Stop it!

1:02:16.524 --> 1:02:17.900
You wouldn't understand.

1:02:22.739 --> 1:02:24.407
What would I not understand?

1:02:25.658 --> 1:02:28.327
We're a big family out here on the ocean.

1:02:28.911 --> 1:02:31.205
But the ship
isn't the only place where family is.

1:02:31.706 --> 1:02:33.166
We have family elsewhere.

1:02:33.958 --> 1:02:36.711
The family of those who've died before us,

1:02:36.794 --> 1:02:38.755
and more family to come in the future.

1:02:39.964 --> 1:02:40.882
Right now…

1:02:42.675 --> 1:02:44.802
there's nothing I can do for those people.

1:02:48.806 --> 1:02:50.808
Is that your responsibility as captain?

1:02:52.143 --> 1:02:53.144
That's some…

1:02:54.937 --> 1:02:55.813
pain in the neck.

1:02:57.064 --> 1:02:58.274
I want to know!

1:02:59.942 --> 1:03:02.612
Why did you think
the treasure would be gold pieces?

1:03:03.362 --> 1:03:06.157
If the tusk is right and it's supposed
to be enough to rebuild Goryeo,

1:03:06.657 --> 1:03:08.701
it would be all the gold pieces
in the Royal Treasury.

1:03:08.785 --> 1:03:12.330
-Gold pieces?
-And what about that goblin flag?

1:03:15.082 --> 1:03:16.250
It's back in the cave.

1:03:17.001 --> 1:03:19.962
Turn around. We're going back
to the cave to get the flag.

1:03:20.046 --> 1:03:21.547
-What?
-Huh?

1:03:21.631 --> 1:03:23.424
That flag is an inverted sea chart.

1:03:23.508 --> 1:03:24.717
A sea chart?

1:03:24.801 --> 1:03:26.552
It might be a map to the treasure,

1:03:27.053 --> 1:03:28.679
to the Royal Treasury's gold.

1:03:30.932 --> 1:03:33.518
Turn the ship around!
Turn the ship around!

1:03:34.644 --> 1:03:35.603
No. No!

1:03:35.686 --> 1:03:37.897
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:39.482
-No?
-No?

1:03:39.565 --> 1:03:40.608
There's no need to go back.

1:03:40.691 --> 1:03:43.110
-What are you doing?
-Just hand it over.

1:03:43.778 --> 1:03:46.030
-Hand what over?
-You have it, the goblin flag.

1:03:46.113 --> 1:03:47.031
What was that?

1:03:48.741 --> 1:03:50.243
I don't.

1:03:50.326 --> 1:03:52.119
-What? Hey!
-You…

1:03:52.203 --> 1:03:53.996
Where did you hide it?

1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:56.624
-Wait a minute!
-Where did you hide it?

1:03:57.416 --> 1:03:59.752
Fine! The treasure…

1:03:59.836 --> 1:04:00.837
Search him!

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:03.548
Come here, you!

1:04:03.631 --> 1:04:06.008
-Strip off all his clothes.
-I lost it!

1:04:07.426 --> 1:04:09.512
Just kill me instead!

1:04:09.595 --> 1:04:11.597
You must be having a rough time, huh?

1:04:12.390 --> 1:04:14.517
Captain, please.

1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:17.603
-You poor thing.
-It's been so hard.

1:04:17.687 --> 1:04:19.313
Blow.

1:04:19.897 --> 1:04:22.191
Have some heart.
How could you be so cruel to Mak-yi?

1:04:22.275 --> 1:04:24.735
Make it stop. End this cruelty.

1:04:25.361 --> 1:04:27.488
So cruel.

1:04:33.786 --> 1:04:36.247
The goblin map. You saw it, right?

1:04:36.956 --> 1:04:39.667
Did you happen to see any of the markings?

1:04:40.293 --> 1:04:41.127
Yes.

1:04:41.836 --> 1:04:43.004
The location?

1:04:43.963 --> 1:04:45.298
The island of Inazuma.

1:04:47.174 --> 1:04:48.009
What "ma"?

1:04:50.094 --> 1:04:52.805
In our language, it's, um, "Beongaesum."

1:04:52.889 --> 1:04:54.807
-Beongaesum?
-Beongaes--.

1:04:54.891 --> 1:04:56.434
Hey.

1:04:56.517 --> 1:04:58.102
Wait. The Beongaesum from the stories?

1:04:59.186 --> 1:05:00.062
Are you joking?

1:05:00.146 --> 1:05:03.024
Storm clouds rain down lightning
there 1,000 times a day.

1:05:03.107 --> 1:05:06.193
Every time it comes down, it's ten years'
worth of lightning in one go,

1:05:06.277 --> 1:05:07.320
like pop, pop, pop!

1:05:07.403 --> 1:05:09.488
Ten years worth? Bullshit!

1:05:09.572 --> 1:05:10.823
Hey. It's true, okay?

1:05:10.907 --> 1:05:11.741
Where is it, then?

1:05:13.409 --> 1:05:15.119
I've only heard of it.
I've never been there.

1:05:15.202 --> 1:05:16.704
Never been there?

1:05:16.787 --> 1:05:18.080
-You little--
-He's not lying.

1:05:19.123 --> 1:05:20.833
Oh. So you've been there, Captain?

1:05:20.917 --> 1:05:25.171
Sometimes, the whole sky fills up
with lightning as far as the eye can see.

1:05:25.922 --> 1:05:27.506
It sounds like quite the spectacle.

1:05:27.590 --> 1:05:29.425
I've never actually seen it either.

1:05:32.678 --> 1:05:34.722
It had to be Beongaesum.

1:05:37.433 --> 1:05:38.851
Swirling winds rip the sails,

1:05:39.435 --> 1:05:41.228
the lightning snaps the mast.

1:05:43.272 --> 1:05:44.857
It's a living hell among hells.

1:05:52.949 --> 1:05:54.116
And who told you that?

1:05:54.200 --> 1:05:56.869
Despite how I look,
I'm a man of the oceans.

1:05:56.953 --> 1:06:00.581
I was born on a pirate ship, traveling the
oceans since suckling my mother's breast.

1:06:00.665 --> 1:06:01.832
Hang on.

1:06:02.458 --> 1:06:04.043
That means you know the way?

1:06:09.298 --> 1:06:10.925
Jeez…

1:06:12.134 --> 1:06:13.552
This is ridiculous.

1:06:20.142 --> 1:06:21.227
Woohoo!

1:06:21.811 --> 1:06:23.354
What is that big, bad boy?

1:06:23.437 --> 1:06:24.563
That's the Fire Dragon Cannon

1:06:24.647 --> 1:06:26.691
that the Emperor Hongwu
bestowed upon King Gongmin

1:06:26.774 --> 1:06:28.234
to suppress the Japanese pirates.

1:06:28.317 --> 1:06:29.568
Weren't we after treasure?

1:06:30.069 --> 1:06:31.821
There's more than just Japanese pirates.

1:06:31.904 --> 1:06:34.490
Yeah. Those other pirate bastards.

1:06:34.573 --> 1:06:36.492
Captain, if I may,

1:06:36.575 --> 1:06:38.244
I'm gonna give this bad boy a try.

1:06:38.327 --> 1:06:39.704
Me too!

1:06:40.538 --> 1:06:42.206
Do you like killing that much?

1:06:42.289 --> 1:06:44.375
Isn't that the joy of life?

1:06:46.669 --> 1:06:48.838
Out of the way. Out of the way!

1:06:48.921 --> 1:06:49.797
Get out!

1:06:55.636 --> 1:06:59.015
With a blanket of dark clouds,
the entire sky is filled with lightning,

1:06:59.098 --> 1:07:01.517
like zap, zap, zap, zap, zap.

1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:03.227
So where is this exactly, huh?

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:07.815
Will you quit interrupting?
We'll be up all night at this rate.

1:07:07.898 --> 1:07:09.442
-This bastard!
-Whoa! Captain!

1:07:09.525 --> 1:07:10.776
Stop cutting him off!

1:07:13.988 --> 1:07:14.822
Okay.

1:07:18.242 --> 1:07:19.326
Where was I?

1:07:20.745 --> 1:07:23.539
Anyway, we can't go there.
We'll definitely die if we do.

1:07:23.622 --> 1:07:27.585
Okay, I understand. So why don't you
just tell us just the location. All right?

1:07:27.668 --> 1:07:29.211
-Hmm?
-I told you we'll all die.

1:07:29.295 --> 1:07:31.255
You're a good boy. Right, Mak-yi?

1:07:31.338 --> 1:07:33.883
We won't go. So tell me, where is it?

1:07:33.966 --> 1:07:36.052
If you're not going,
why do you need the location?

1:07:36.135 --> 1:07:38.054
This bastard!

1:07:38.888 --> 1:07:41.599
-Give me a sword. I'll just kill him now.
-Here, Captain.

1:07:45.019 --> 1:07:46.270
Let's not go there, Captain.

1:07:46.353 --> 1:07:48.731
Those waters sound too dangerous
to cross with mere courage.

1:07:48.814 --> 1:07:50.191
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

1:07:50.274 --> 1:07:54.153
To be afraid of the sea, of all places,
you can't call yourself a pirate. Can you?

1:07:54.236 --> 1:07:55.237
He's a fisherman.

1:07:55.321 --> 1:07:58.157
We are pirates,
and the open sea is our domain!

1:07:58.240 --> 1:07:59.867
The gold is waiting for us!

1:07:59.950 --> 1:08:01.869
No one can stop us,
not even ourselves!

1:08:01.952 --> 1:08:04.080
To find the treasure!

1:08:04.163 --> 1:08:05.164
Let's go!

1:08:05.748 --> 1:08:07.708
If you guide us to Bongaesum,

1:08:07.792 --> 1:08:10.044
you can keep a tenth
of the treasure there.

1:08:11.378 --> 1:08:13.130
Why would we give it to him?

1:08:14.298 --> 1:08:16.425
Give it to me now, while I'm still alive.

1:08:17.343 --> 1:08:19.595
If I'm dead, what good is gold?

1:08:19.678 --> 1:08:22.056
Is there something else?

1:08:23.891 --> 1:08:26.519
There's nothing here
worth exchanging your life for?

1:08:27.186 --> 1:08:29.688
Well, it's not
that there isn't anything I want.

1:08:29.772 --> 1:08:31.816
It's not like you're going
to give it to me, so…

1:08:31.899 --> 1:08:33.150
What is it, then?

1:08:35.778 --> 1:08:36.695
It's…

1:08:38.239 --> 1:08:40.157
I can't bring myself to say it.

1:08:40.241 --> 1:08:41.700
What is it? Say it!

1:08:42.284 --> 1:08:44.870
-Only I know how to get there.
-Yes, indeed.

1:08:44.954 --> 1:08:47.289
-Only I have been there.
-We know, we know.

1:08:47.373 --> 1:08:49.708
With that in mind… See…

1:08:49.792 --> 1:08:51.794
I got it!

1:08:54.046 --> 1:08:56.006
You want to become the captain.

1:08:56.090 --> 1:08:57.466
What?

1:09:03.430 --> 1:09:05.933
It's unfair for me to die
after being treated like this.

1:09:06.016 --> 1:09:09.145
So just at least
until we find the treasure,

1:09:09.979 --> 1:09:10.896
Pirate King.

1:09:11.814 --> 1:09:13.691
Are you mad? Do you want a swift death?

1:09:16.152 --> 1:09:17.194
Put it down.

1:09:18.445 --> 1:09:19.488
Shouldn't

1:09:20.948 --> 1:09:21.907
the captain decide?

1:09:23.742 --> 1:09:24.577
Well?

1:09:25.244 --> 1:09:26.203
Ah.

1:09:26.704 --> 1:09:30.958
As a captain you can risk your life,
but you can't give up your authority, huh?

1:09:37.464 --> 1:09:38.757
I'll ask everyone!

1:09:40.176 --> 1:09:42.011
You can choose one or the other.

1:09:43.304 --> 1:09:46.557
Shall we go find the treasure
after fulfilling Mak-yi's request?

1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:49.852
Or shall we kill him right now
to maintain order?

1:09:51.854 --> 1:09:53.564
Those of you who want the treasure

1:09:54.607 --> 1:09:55.441
raise your hand.

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:01.280
Come on, Captain.

1:10:03.574 --> 1:10:05.075
You need to close your eyes.

1:10:12.041 --> 1:10:13.292
Mother,

1:10:14.293 --> 1:10:16.253
I am the Pirate King.

1:10:23.719 --> 1:10:25.804
Let me greet the Dragon King!

1:10:26.972 --> 1:10:27.973
I am the new…

1:10:28.474 --> 1:10:33.270
Pirate King, Mak-yi!

1:10:36.232 --> 1:10:37.066
Captain,

1:10:37.566 --> 1:10:40.402
uh, leave this kind of chore
to your subordinates. All right?

1:10:40.486 --> 1:10:42.821
Think of it as a vacation
for a few days, and take a break.

1:10:43.572 --> 1:10:44.406
Dammit!

1:10:44.490 --> 1:10:47.284
The captain is the one
manning the helm, of course.

1:10:48.077 --> 1:10:52.081
So just call me Rang, the quartermaster.

1:10:52.164 --> 1:10:53.707
Come on, Captain!

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:56.001
It's almost dinnertime.

1:10:56.919 --> 1:10:58.003
Off you go!

1:10:59.630 --> 1:11:01.423
I mean, how could we possibly do anything

1:11:01.507 --> 1:11:03.008
when you're down here working, Captain?

1:11:03.092 --> 1:11:03.926
Get out, dammit!

1:11:08.180 --> 1:11:09.056
Please.

1:11:09.139 --> 1:11:10.349
Okay, okay, Rang.

1:11:10.432 --> 1:11:13.227
-Rang? Did you say Rang?
-Come on. She seems upset.

1:11:13.727 --> 1:11:14.561
Big time.

1:11:14.645 --> 1:11:16.480
She's sensitive
about the situation

1:11:16.563 --> 1:11:18.357
even though it's only for a few days.

1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:21.151
Even if it's only for a few days,
they're all blinded by the gold.

1:11:21.235 --> 1:11:23.362
Dammit! I'll kill the ones
who raised their hands!

1:11:23.445 --> 1:11:27.032
-Why are you hitting me?
-You kept your eyes open.

1:11:27.116 --> 1:11:28.033
Chin up, yeah?

1:11:29.118 --> 1:11:30.119
Rang.

1:11:30.953 --> 1:11:33.372
As far as I'm concerned,
I really felt relieved.

1:11:34.206 --> 1:11:35.249
How about you?

1:11:38.252 --> 1:11:40.671
Hey. Money is the real boss
these days, you know?

1:11:40.754 --> 1:11:43.590
You just lost against gold.
How do you win against gold, hmm?

1:11:43.674 --> 1:11:45.801
Don't mind it too much.

1:11:48.095 --> 1:11:49.596
Tread carefully.

1:11:50.973 --> 1:11:52.766
It's not about the position.

1:11:53.517 --> 1:11:55.894
I was willing to give it up
if there was anyone worthy.

1:11:56.645 --> 1:11:58.022
Worthy how?

1:11:58.689 --> 1:12:00.524
Captain Mak-yi, time to eat!

1:12:06.989 --> 1:12:08.824
-Who am I?
-The new captain.

1:12:11.452 --> 1:12:12.828
New captain, sir.

1:12:13.537 --> 1:12:15.456
From now on, no fishy food on my plate.

1:12:15.539 --> 1:12:17.833
Bring me a cooked chicken and rice wine.

1:12:17.916 --> 1:12:19.001
Hey, captain?

1:12:19.501 --> 1:12:21.295
Halfmoon Island is on the right.

1:12:21.378 --> 1:12:22.755
Didn't you say to make a left here?

1:12:22.838 --> 1:12:24.548
You're a moron.

1:12:24.631 --> 1:12:26.258
Why didn't you tell me when you saw it?

1:12:26.342 --> 1:12:27.509
But I just got up here.

1:12:27.593 --> 1:12:29.136
Why couldn't you get up there sooner?

1:12:29.219 --> 1:12:31.638
Because someone
was standing up here until now,

1:12:31.722 --> 1:12:33.640
acting all cool and showing off.

1:12:33.724 --> 1:12:34.850
Don't give him any food.

1:12:34.933 --> 1:12:36.852
Even old squid is wasted on that fool.

1:12:36.935 --> 1:12:38.395
No food for you. Eat that!

1:12:40.230 --> 1:12:41.648
-Jerk.
-Hey. Wipe here.

1:12:42.441 --> 1:12:43.692
That's enough. Get lost.

1:12:45.652 --> 1:12:47.237
-Hey, Witless.
-Yeah?

1:12:47.321 --> 1:12:48.197
Go up there too.

1:12:48.280 --> 1:12:49.990
Isn't one person enough?

1:12:50.074 --> 1:12:51.950
You can't really see
once the sun sets anyway.

1:12:52.034 --> 1:12:54.036
-We need to have dinner, Captain.
-I'm hungry.

1:12:54.119 --> 1:12:56.872
You'll eat your dinner up there
with that other moron!

1:12:58.332 --> 1:13:00.459
How could he change that much?
It's pissing me off.

1:13:00.542 --> 1:13:02.961
-What are you muttering about?
-I didn't say anything.

1:13:10.135 --> 1:13:11.512
Yeah!

1:13:12.304 --> 1:13:14.014
You are incredible!

1:13:14.515 --> 1:13:17.768
Hey. How did you…
did you make sardines taste like this?

1:13:18.352 --> 1:13:19.895
Not all sardines are the same.

1:13:20.396 --> 1:13:24.024
Ocean flavors, if you know them,
you can draw the real flavor like this.

1:13:24.608 --> 1:13:25.776
Wow!

1:13:25.859 --> 1:13:28.153
I knew you had good cooking skills.

1:13:28.821 --> 1:13:31.323
But I never expected it
to be this good. Seriously!

1:13:32.616 --> 1:13:33.700
Mmm!

1:13:35.744 --> 1:13:37.287
Hey. The Captain should not be cooking!

1:13:38.497 --> 1:13:39.998
She's better as a captain than a chef!

1:13:49.216 --> 1:13:51.009
I finished it! All of it!

1:13:53.804 --> 1:13:57.099
Take your time eating.
I'll make it often from now on.

1:13:57.724 --> 1:13:59.059
Huh?

1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:00.436
Mmm!

1:14:05.983 --> 1:14:08.527
I'm telling you it's very serious

1:14:08.610 --> 1:14:09.695
I can't sleep.

1:14:12.614 --> 1:14:13.574
Come over here.

1:14:14.616 --> 1:14:15.492
Take a look at this.

1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:18.704
The legs of the bed are all bro… ken.

1:14:20.247 --> 1:14:21.832
All fixed now.

1:14:21.915 --> 1:14:23.417
Good. Excuse me.

1:14:27.212 --> 1:14:29.339
-Why would you fix the bed, Rang?
-Why not me?

1:14:30.716 --> 1:14:33.886
Do you have any idea
how hard it was to break all of those?

1:14:33.969 --> 1:14:34.803
Huh?

1:14:35.471 --> 1:14:38.849
Seriously…
I mean, why did you…

1:14:39.475 --> 1:14:40.309
I'm sorry.

1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:42.394
It's okay.

1:14:42.895 --> 1:14:45.606
Could you help me out
and let me borrow that red stuff?

1:14:46.398 --> 1:14:48.150
The thing you put on your lips.

1:14:52.196 --> 1:14:53.906
I have no such thing.

1:14:53.989 --> 1:14:54.907
You know. Come on.

1:14:55.407 --> 1:14:58.076
When you're around Mu-chi
in the kitchen, and you put it on to--

1:15:02.414 --> 1:15:04.625
Rang, are you there?

1:15:11.715 --> 1:15:13.425
Did you ask me here to see this?

1:15:13.509 --> 1:15:14.343
You like it?

1:15:18.096 --> 1:15:19.056
I forgot

1:15:20.474 --> 1:15:22.267
the night sky was always so beautiful.

1:15:39.826 --> 1:15:41.036
What did you put in your hair?

1:15:41.828 --> 1:15:42.704
My hair?

1:15:43.247 --> 1:15:45.541
Uh, it's oily from not washing it.

1:15:46.083 --> 1:15:47.793
Who the hell was it?

1:15:47.876 --> 1:15:49.920
Who touched my sesame oil?

1:15:52.256 --> 1:15:53.465
They're looking for you.

1:15:56.760 --> 1:15:57.594
Rang,

1:15:58.762 --> 1:16:00.097
what do you know of love?

1:16:00.597 --> 1:16:01.890
That's personal.

1:16:01.974 --> 1:16:03.475
Huh?

1:16:03.559 --> 1:16:05.435
What are you talking about, personal?

1:16:07.271 --> 1:16:09.648
Love means something different
for everyone.

1:16:10.649 --> 1:16:12.025
Just like waves of different sizes.

1:16:13.735 --> 1:16:16.863
Then is love you give to courtesans
a big wave or a small wave?

1:16:19.533 --> 1:16:21.535
-I only drank there.
-Yeah. Sure.

1:16:22.619 --> 1:16:24.788
I only drank. I swear.

1:16:25.581 --> 1:16:27.124
Your quartermaster, Kang-seop…

1:16:27.207 --> 1:16:29.293
I don't recall asking about that.

1:16:31.044 --> 1:16:32.504
Really, I only drank.

1:16:32.588 --> 1:16:34.131
-Kang-seop--
-I'm going back down.

1:16:34.214 --> 1:16:35.048
Rang.

1:16:36.049 --> 1:16:37.676
Rang, wait. Take a look at this.

1:16:38.385 --> 1:16:39.219
Rang.

1:16:39.845 --> 1:16:44.016
"Meaning is as deep as the sea,
but courage is hidden in the dark.

1:16:44.099 --> 1:16:47.936
Pass by the flash of light
and find the light of the truth."

1:16:49.813 --> 1:16:51.273
What does it mean, captain?

1:16:51.857 --> 1:16:55.777
We have to solve this riddle
in order to find the treasure.

1:16:56.361 --> 1:17:00.073
Impaling the head on a spike is a
punishment usually reserved for traitors.

1:17:00.157 --> 1:17:01.950
Do you know who these 12 men are, captain?

1:17:10.834 --> 1:17:12.461
The sea is boiling!

1:17:12.544 --> 1:17:14.379
What? The sea is boiling?

1:17:17.466 --> 1:17:18.425
What's that?

1:17:18.508 --> 1:17:20.010
Dark clouds will roll in soon.

1:17:20.552 --> 1:17:21.928
We must fold the sails, now.

1:17:22.012 --> 1:17:24.806
Fold the sails! Fold the sails!

1:17:24.890 --> 1:17:26.099
Not yet!

1:17:26.183 --> 1:17:29.019
-Don't do it yet.
-Not until I say so.

1:17:29.102 --> 1:17:31.855
If we mistime it,
we'll be swept into the Sea of Fire!

1:17:33.815 --> 1:17:35.942
Trust me, Captain.

1:17:36.026 --> 1:17:37.069
Do tell.

1:17:38.445 --> 1:17:40.530
How does the former captain
not know Bongaesum,

1:17:40.614 --> 1:17:42.115
but knows the Sea of Fire?

1:17:42.199 --> 1:17:44.785
I was swept into it
by a rainstorm when I was young.

1:17:45.535 --> 1:17:49.164
And this rising haze
looks just like it did then.

1:17:51.249 --> 1:17:53.919
The Sea of Fire appears
after passing Bongaesum.

1:17:54.419 --> 1:17:56.004
Even a ghost would die there,

1:17:57.422 --> 1:17:58.340
but you survived?

1:17:58.423 --> 1:18:00.425
I wouldn't be standing here if I hadn't.

1:18:00.509 --> 1:18:04.262
I've heard that hundreds of thousands
of dragons live in the Sea of Fire, so…

1:18:05.722 --> 1:18:06.640
You've seen a dragon?

1:18:06.723 --> 1:18:07.974
When you see it for real,

1:18:08.058 --> 1:18:10.435
it's not dragons,
but huge pillars of fire.

1:18:10.936 --> 1:18:14.564
Hundreds and thousands
of pillars of fire piercing the sea

1:18:14.648 --> 1:18:16.400
and surging into the sky!

1:18:16.483 --> 1:18:18.527
The black clouds are rolling in!

1:18:26.993 --> 1:18:29.246
We must hurry and fold the sails.

1:18:29.329 --> 1:18:30.997
If we lose the sails, we lose everything!

1:18:31.081 --> 1:18:32.749
I just said not yet!

1:18:34.584 --> 1:18:35.919
I know the way.

1:18:36.503 --> 1:18:37.754
Huh?

1:18:38.296 --> 1:18:39.589
Everyone out of the way!

1:18:41.258 --> 1:18:42.551
Lightning!

1:18:49.099 --> 1:18:51.977
Quickly fold the sails
and batten down the hatches!

1:18:53.019 --> 1:18:53.895
Fold the sails!

1:19:01.695 --> 1:19:03.739
Get out!

1:19:07.492 --> 1:19:10.912
Keep your heads down! We're all gonna die!

1:19:13.373 --> 1:19:14.374
Captain!

1:19:19.254 --> 1:19:21.965
Captain Mak-yi, take the wheel!
You know the way!

1:19:22.048 --> 1:19:25.844
Captain Mak-yi!
The wheel is spinning by itself!

1:19:34.770 --> 1:19:36.563
Captain Mak-yi, go quickly!

1:19:51.495 --> 1:19:52.788
We'll all die up here!

1:19:53.371 --> 1:19:54.331
Get below deck!

1:19:54.915 --> 1:19:56.416
Go down! Go down!

1:19:56.500 --> 1:19:58.543
If the boat fills
with water, you'll all die!

1:19:58.627 --> 1:19:59.669
Don't go below deck!

1:20:00.337 --> 1:20:02.756
Get back up! Get back up!

1:20:04.925 --> 1:20:06.676
Tie yourself with rope.

1:20:06.760 --> 1:20:08.762
Captain Mak-yi, give the order!

1:20:09.596 --> 1:20:10.931
Do that! Do that!

1:20:11.014 --> 1:20:13.266
If the ship wrecks,
you won't be able to escape!

1:20:13.350 --> 1:20:15.435
Don't tie yourself! Just hold on!

1:20:15.519 --> 1:20:16.520
Hold on!

1:20:16.603 --> 1:20:18.855
Everyone, follow Rang's orders!

1:20:18.939 --> 1:20:23.485
If you just keep your mouth shut
it'd be fine Wu Mu-chi!

1:20:30.325 --> 1:20:32.035
That's what they're for, captain?

1:20:33.078 --> 1:20:35.455
As expected of our captain!

1:21:01.231 --> 1:21:02.357
Hold on tight!

1:21:08.154 --> 1:21:10.073
Help me!

1:21:14.828 --> 1:21:17.330
Quickly fold the sails
and batten down the hatches!

1:21:19.291 --> 1:21:20.542
Quickly! Go!

1:21:25.171 --> 1:21:28.300
This isn't ten years' worth of lightning!
It's like 10,000 years'!

1:21:53.450 --> 1:21:55.994
Pull yourself together! Grab my neck.

1:21:58.955 --> 1:22:00.165
Not like that.

1:22:05.921 --> 1:22:07.964
-Help!
-Save us!

1:22:08.048 --> 1:22:09.215
Ah, shit!

1:22:41.748 --> 1:22:42.874
What?

1:22:42.958 --> 1:22:45.710
This is it! We're finally here!

1:22:47.128 --> 1:22:49.798
Save us! We're over here!

1:22:49.881 --> 1:22:51.091
Save us!

1:22:51.174 --> 1:22:54.177
After the first lightning strike,
you get out of the way?

1:22:54.260 --> 1:22:55.470
Your first storm, huh?

1:22:55.553 --> 1:22:57.472
He was the first to run away, dammit!

1:22:57.555 --> 1:22:59.391
-Get off!
-You're all idiots!

1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:13.196
Captain Mak-yi,
where's the treasure?

1:23:13.279 --> 1:23:15.323
We have to find it. We don't have the map.

1:23:15.407 --> 1:23:16.616
What?

1:23:17.117 --> 1:23:20.078
It's a small island.
If we dig around, we'll stumble across it.

1:23:20.662 --> 1:23:22.455
Small? You call this small?

1:23:25.333 --> 1:23:27.085
I ought to kill this fool.

1:23:28.003 --> 1:23:30.338
What? Why are you all staring at me, huh?

1:23:30.422 --> 1:23:31.840
You're the leader.

1:23:32.882 --> 1:23:34.592
When did you treat me like one?

1:23:35.176 --> 1:23:37.512
Not one of you
ever followed my orders, dammit!

1:23:37.595 --> 1:23:39.222
You all talk behind my back,

1:23:39.305 --> 1:23:41.433
then put me on the spot
when things got dangerous?

1:23:41.516 --> 1:23:42.684
It's like being a damn slave!

1:23:42.767 --> 1:23:45.311
That's what being a leader is.
You didn't know?

1:23:45.395 --> 1:23:46.688
He's right.

1:23:46.771 --> 1:23:47.605
That's insane.

1:23:48.189 --> 1:23:50.358
Right. Just a moment.

1:24:02.454 --> 1:24:04.581
-He remembers.
-What is it?

1:24:04.664 --> 1:24:06.374
I quit being the leader.

1:24:06.458 --> 1:24:08.835
I'll crush his head! I'm serious!

1:24:11.504 --> 1:24:13.923
Bongaesum ahoy!

1:24:14.007 --> 1:24:14.924
Where?

1:24:22.182 --> 1:24:24.517
Let go of me!
Let go! I'm walking!

1:24:26.061 --> 1:24:28.772
Boss, this is the land, not the ocean.

1:24:29.647 --> 1:24:32.776
The dragon is master at sea,
but the tiger is on land.

1:24:34.402 --> 1:24:36.529
So, now I, Mak-yi, the Pirate King…

1:24:40.575 --> 1:24:41.951
…will follow your orders.

1:24:45.163 --> 1:24:48.124
I've been away at sea too long, Captain.

1:24:48.833 --> 1:24:51.127
Quartermaster, you dare to lead the way

1:24:51.211 --> 1:24:53.254
when Captain Mak-yi,
who knows the way, is behind you?

1:24:53.338 --> 1:24:56.424
Come here,
Captain Mak-yi, in three, two…

1:24:59.260 --> 1:25:00.095
It's over there.

1:25:07.727 --> 1:25:08.895
Looking for something?

1:25:09.729 --> 1:25:11.022
A stream of water.

1:25:13.233 --> 1:25:15.110
You sure are a natural leader.

1:25:16.569 --> 1:25:18.321
Joo Bang would have done the same.

1:25:21.825 --> 1:25:22.659
Hurry!

1:25:26.121 --> 1:25:27.956
These folks
sure rest peacefully here.

1:25:29.207 --> 1:25:32.168
This is why no one's seen Joo Bang
since he disappeared.

1:25:37.382 --> 1:25:39.884
By the way,
did you solve the riddle, Captain?

1:25:41.177 --> 1:25:45.265
"Meaning is as deep as the sea,
courage is hidden in the dark.

1:25:45.348 --> 1:25:50.353
Pass by the flash of light
and find the light of the truth."

1:25:54.899 --> 1:25:56.317
There's nothing here.

1:25:56.401 --> 1:25:58.570
If you're not gonna trust me,
stop digging!

1:25:58.653 --> 1:26:01.156
The lightning is striking the same place.

1:26:01.656 --> 1:26:02.657
Now!

1:26:03.158 --> 1:26:04.325
-Hmm.
-See?

1:26:04.409 --> 1:26:06.661
It strikes the same place over and over.

1:26:06.744 --> 1:26:09.247
Just when you think it's done, it--

1:26:09.330 --> 1:26:10.331
There! Right now.

1:26:10.874 --> 1:26:12.083
Whoa.

1:26:12.917 --> 1:26:14.210
Is there something there?

1:26:14.836 --> 1:26:17.130
-It seems like it.
-But what?

1:26:17.839 --> 1:26:19.674
-Shall we see?
-Shall we?

1:26:19.757 --> 1:26:22.218
Don't dig there. Dig right here.

1:26:22.302 --> 1:26:23.553
Should we dig more?

1:26:25.013 --> 1:26:26.389
-Dig more.
-More?

1:26:27.056 --> 1:26:28.057
Just a little bit more.

1:26:28.641 --> 1:26:29.934
Ugh. Dammit.

1:26:30.018 --> 1:26:32.187
Wow. Look at all you've dug!

1:26:32.270 --> 1:26:34.522
These morons just keep digging
because I told them to?

1:26:38.359 --> 1:26:39.485
Something's here!

1:26:39.569 --> 1:26:41.988
He found something.

1:26:42.071 --> 1:26:43.948
Let's bury him here when he comes over.

1:26:44.741 --> 1:26:45.992
-Alive?
-Hey.

1:26:46.951 --> 1:26:48.661
You… you've found something?

1:26:48.745 --> 1:26:50.788
-Treasure.
-Get that son of a bitch!

1:26:51.998 --> 1:26:54.125
Get that bastard, dammit!

1:26:56.336 --> 1:26:57.712
I'll go on my own.

1:26:58.213 --> 1:27:00.131
Gold is truly amazing.

1:27:01.132 --> 1:27:01.966
Hmm?

1:27:02.884 --> 1:27:06.262
I've never seen you doing something
without someone ordering you to.

1:27:09.057 --> 1:27:10.308
It's because you want it.

1:27:10.391 --> 1:27:13.019
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here.

1:27:13.519 --> 1:27:15.438
Or stayed on that damned sea at all.

1:27:22.987 --> 1:27:24.239
The first time I saw you,

1:27:24.781 --> 1:27:27.116
I thought you were the angel of death
coming for my soul.

1:27:32.205 --> 1:27:33.373
My heart fluttered

1:27:35.625 --> 1:27:37.085
thinking of a death with you.

1:27:42.423 --> 1:27:43.841
I was happy to be dying.

1:28:00.608 --> 1:28:01.943
Eat this if you're hungry.

1:28:09.701 --> 1:28:11.703
Wow! This, uh…

1:28:12.704 --> 1:28:13.663
Delicious.

1:28:13.746 --> 1:28:14.664
Hmm.

1:28:14.747 --> 1:28:15.915
Mmm.

1:28:18.334 --> 1:28:19.168
Thanks so much.

1:28:20.086 --> 1:28:20.920
Don't mention it.

1:29:30.281 --> 1:29:31.449
"Traitors."

1:29:48.174 --> 1:29:49.884
We've come to the right place.

1:29:54.180 --> 1:29:55.598
Yi Seong-gye.

1:29:56.224 --> 1:29:57.266
Jeong Do-jeon.

1:29:57.350 --> 1:30:00.478
And that's Left State Counselor
Cho Min-su.

1:30:00.561 --> 1:30:04.440
All the founders of Joseon
are all gathered here.

1:30:04.524 --> 1:30:07.026
Those were the twelve traitors of Goryeo.

1:30:07.944 --> 1:30:11.948
Pull out the spear of the one that served
his majesty and dig underneath it.

1:30:12.615 --> 1:30:13.741
Go pull out the spear!

1:30:13.825 --> 1:30:16.202
Now! Move faster!

1:30:16.828 --> 1:30:17.954
I said move it!

1:30:19.414 --> 1:30:22.250
Go! Pull the spear out, now!

1:30:27.171 --> 1:30:29.173
Pull out the spear, now!

1:30:30.258 --> 1:30:33.970
There will be a greater reward
for those who show courage!

1:30:34.053 --> 1:30:35.847
You heard him! Pull out the spear!

1:30:35.930 --> 1:30:37.265
Get a move on!

1:30:37.932 --> 1:30:38.766
Hurry!

1:30:38.850 --> 1:30:40.476
If you run, you're dead!

1:30:45.731 --> 1:30:48.401
-A trap?
-It's a trap! Get back!

1:31:00.371 --> 1:31:01.789
Choe Yeong.

1:31:03.708 --> 1:31:04.625
YEONG

1:31:04.709 --> 1:31:08.045
The last general of Goryeo
who fought against Yi Seong-ye.

1:31:08.546 --> 1:31:10.089
That's General Choe Yeong's flag.

1:31:11.716 --> 1:31:12.675
Choe Yeong.

1:31:14.510 --> 1:31:19.474
Goryeo's last general
surrounded by the founders of Joseon.

1:31:20.308 --> 1:31:21.350
That's the one.

1:31:25.062 --> 1:31:27.106
Captain, the apparatus!
The apparatus!

1:31:38.534 --> 1:31:39.368
It worked!

1:31:39.452 --> 1:31:40.745
Of course, that's the one.

1:31:57.220 --> 1:31:58.054
What are you?

1:31:59.805 --> 1:32:01.057
A bird or a fish?

1:32:03.017 --> 1:32:04.018
What?

1:32:04.977 --> 1:32:07.104
Gold! Unbelievable!

1:32:09.315 --> 1:32:11.901
There really is gold here.

1:32:11.984 --> 1:32:14.195
Mak-yi, you ass! I can't believe you.

1:32:14.278 --> 1:32:16.447
If I find you, I'll tear off your head!

1:32:16.531 --> 1:32:17.532
I found it!

1:32:18.658 --> 1:32:20.826
I found the gold!

1:32:20.910 --> 1:32:22.078
He found it? Where?

1:32:22.161 --> 1:32:23.704
Over here, you jerks!

1:32:23.788 --> 1:32:26.040
-I found it!
-Where's the gold, Captain Mak-yi?

1:32:26.666 --> 1:32:27.875
-There.
-Where is it?

1:32:27.959 --> 1:32:29.085
You found it?

1:32:30.795 --> 1:32:32.129
Where is it?

1:32:34.423 --> 1:32:35.258
That little…

1:32:36.926 --> 1:32:39.136
You better get back here!

1:32:39.220 --> 1:32:41.180
Enough. Who are you talking to?

1:32:41.264 --> 1:32:42.765
First mate…

1:32:43.724 --> 1:32:44.642
…it was like

1:32:45.184 --> 1:32:47.770
a bird that looks like a man.

1:32:47.853 --> 1:32:49.981
Or a man
that looks like a bird-fish thing.

1:32:50.064 --> 1:32:52.817
This creature
had a huge piece of gold in it's mouth.

1:32:53.693 --> 1:32:56.028
He was right here, like this.

1:32:58.281 --> 1:32:59.657
I call bullshit!

1:33:00.700 --> 1:33:01.826
The last straw.

1:33:02.326 --> 1:33:04.036
-Kill him!
-I'm tired of this!

1:33:07.039 --> 1:33:08.457
That lying mouth!

1:33:12.336 --> 1:33:14.005
-What is that?
-What is that?

1:33:17.883 --> 1:33:19.343
Gold.

1:33:20.428 --> 1:33:21.512
Did you see?

1:33:23.389 --> 1:33:24.557
Did you see?

1:33:25.433 --> 1:33:26.851
Do you believe me?

1:33:27.893 --> 1:33:30.146
Do you believe me?

1:33:34.442 --> 1:33:35.776
Then hurry up and find it.

1:33:35.860 --> 1:33:37.570
The gold is waiting here for us!

1:33:38.487 --> 1:33:42.867
If you can't take it from here,
you're not worthy to be a pirate!

1:33:42.950 --> 1:33:45.578
Let alone a jellyfish!

1:33:45.661 --> 1:33:47.663
Yeah!

1:33:48.247 --> 1:33:51.042
-Find it!
-Find it!

1:34:00.176 --> 1:34:01.886
Where did you get it?

1:34:03.012 --> 1:34:04.347
Say something already!

1:34:04.847 --> 1:34:06.432
Are you asking the bird?

1:34:06.515 --> 1:34:07.516
Bird?

1:34:08.559 --> 1:34:10.269
You still don't get it?

1:34:10.353 --> 1:34:12.563
Here. Give me that. Watch this.

1:34:17.693 --> 1:34:19.403
You saw that, right?
You saw that?

1:34:19.487 --> 1:34:21.489
When have we ever seen
an animal that wants gold?

1:34:21.572 --> 1:34:23.366
Have you? Have you?

1:34:23.449 --> 1:34:25.117
-No.
-I haven't neither.

1:34:25.201 --> 1:34:26.535
You might fool the others,

1:34:26.619 --> 1:34:28.996
but you can't fool a former merchant.

1:34:29.538 --> 1:34:33.209
Are you saying that is actually a person?

1:34:33.834 --> 1:34:36.087
Ugh. This is so damn frustrating!

1:34:36.587 --> 1:34:39.256
Come on. Say something
while we're still being nice.

1:34:39.340 --> 1:34:41.092
Where did you get that gold, huh?

1:34:41.676 --> 1:34:42.927
I'm being nice.

1:34:44.595 --> 1:34:46.806
Do you have to bleed
to start flapping that beak?

1:34:48.474 --> 1:34:50.685
I've never seen someone
as stupid as you are.

1:34:55.272 --> 1:34:56.565
Forgive him, birdie.

1:34:57.066 --> 1:34:58.526
I, Captain Mak-yi,

1:34:58.609 --> 1:35:01.237
apologize for this
rotten bastard crewmember.

1:35:02.905 --> 1:35:05.032
Could you tell us where your leader is?

1:35:08.619 --> 1:35:10.454
What is that?

1:35:13.999 --> 1:35:14.959
It's a cannon.

1:35:17.294 --> 1:35:19.255
Captain, the government ship.

1:35:19.338 --> 1:35:20.381
The ship's here.

1:35:20.464 --> 1:35:21.799
Fire!

1:35:28.347 --> 1:35:29.265
Huh?

1:35:29.348 --> 1:35:31.767
We found it! We found it!

1:35:31.851 --> 1:35:34.645
Pull it up. Hurry!

1:35:35.229 --> 1:35:36.564
It actually exists.

1:35:36.647 --> 1:35:38.399
Pull it up! Yeah!

1:35:46.282 --> 1:35:47.533
The little rat.

1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:01.839
Wu Mu-chi.

1:36:11.807 --> 1:36:15.227
You've done a good job finding a treasure
that belongs to someone else.

1:36:15.311 --> 1:36:16.145
And who is that?

1:36:17.062 --> 1:36:17.897
Me.

1:36:23.736 --> 1:36:26.655
Leave it to us to cut off
that crazy bastard's head!

1:36:32.912 --> 1:36:35.247
Don't stop now! Fire!

1:36:44.799 --> 1:36:46.133
What do we do?

1:36:47.009 --> 1:36:47.968
Captain?

1:37:01.190 --> 1:37:02.483
Listen up.

1:37:04.026 --> 1:37:05.778
Whether you die fighting with me today,

1:37:05.861 --> 1:37:08.781
or turn your back
and live in regret for abandoning us,

1:37:08.864 --> 1:37:11.200
the choice of where you die
is yours to make.

1:37:11.784 --> 1:37:13.536
But I promise you as a captain,

1:37:13.619 --> 1:37:16.372
I have no intention
of dying on this island.

1:37:16.455 --> 1:37:18.332
And I won't let any of you die

1:37:20.084 --> 1:37:22.545
on this god-forsaken island either.

1:37:23.170 --> 1:37:24.964
Captain, I will stay with you!

1:37:25.047 --> 1:37:26.507
Me too! Me too!

1:37:26.590 --> 1:37:29.552
Captain, we must stay together
from now on.

1:37:29.635 --> 1:37:31.470
You live life only once.

1:37:32.054 --> 1:37:35.057
Let's have our way with gold
and welcome our fate!

1:37:35.140 --> 1:37:36.433
Yeah!

1:37:36.517 --> 1:37:38.269
Let's take down the government ship!

1:37:38.352 --> 1:37:39.895
And find the treasure too!

1:37:43.858 --> 1:37:46.819
Okay! Let's take the government ship now!

1:37:48.112 --> 1:37:50.072
Quartermaster, go rescue your boss.

1:37:50.155 --> 1:37:52.074
Draw the enemy's attention
until we take the ship.

1:37:53.492 --> 1:37:55.870
As former bandits, we're good on land.

1:37:56.871 --> 1:38:00.666
Let's climb that mountain, find our boss,
and have a long overdue reunion!

1:38:00.749 --> 1:38:02.793
-Let's go have some fun!
-Let's go!

1:38:02.877 --> 1:38:04.920
Let's go! Let's go!

1:38:05.713 --> 1:38:09.216
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1:38:09.300 --> 1:38:11.218
Out of the way, man. You're blocking us.

1:38:11.302 --> 1:38:12.469
Let's go!

1:38:13.053 --> 1:38:14.263
Forward!

1:38:16.849 --> 1:38:18.183
I thought I was captain.

1:38:19.810 --> 1:38:20.728
Let's go too.

1:38:23.147 --> 1:38:24.565
To find the damn gold!

1:38:41.707 --> 1:38:42.541
Hae-geum!

1:39:08.901 --> 1:39:11.904
-Where's the treasure?
-All that's here are rocks!

1:39:11.987 --> 1:39:13.447
-Find it!
-Captain!

1:39:18.327 --> 1:39:19.244
Catch him!

1:39:24.500 --> 1:39:25.751
Get him!

1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:30.464
"Entrance"? There's another entrance?

1:39:32.174 --> 1:39:33.717
Where are you going?

1:39:33.801 --> 1:39:34.635
Huh?

1:39:35.636 --> 1:39:37.888
What are you doing? Let's get going!

1:39:37.972 --> 1:39:39.223
Just come here!

1:39:40.599 --> 1:39:41.934
Let's go!

1:39:45.729 --> 1:39:48.107
Our teamwork is terrible, seriously!

1:39:53.862 --> 1:39:57.282
Bu Heung-su!

1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:07.668
Do you need this goblin mask?

1:40:08.752 --> 1:40:11.588
Seems like it's the final key
to find the treasure.

1:40:14.049 --> 1:40:16.760
If you hand it over now,
I'll spare your life.

1:40:17.469 --> 1:40:20.055
You probably don't even have a ship
to carry the treasure, anyway.

1:40:21.598 --> 1:40:22.516
Ship?

1:40:23.267 --> 1:40:24.810
But I only need one ship.

1:40:24.893 --> 1:40:26.520
If you're not a coward,

1:40:27.271 --> 1:40:28.397
me against you.

1:40:29.857 --> 1:40:31.025
Let's duel for the treasure.

1:40:31.108 --> 1:40:32.818
Just don't run away.

1:40:45.205 --> 1:40:46.123
-Huh?
-Oh.

1:41:06.685 --> 1:41:08.896
Stop! This is a leader's duel.

1:41:13.192 --> 1:41:15.235
Can we go
a little faster, please?

1:41:21.450 --> 1:41:22.284
Dragons.

1:41:22.951 --> 1:41:24.286
The dragons are awakening!

1:41:29.500 --> 1:41:32.044
You've been tricking me all along!

1:41:32.127 --> 1:41:33.170
You bastard!

1:41:34.213 --> 1:41:35.589
You'd better run, you turd!

1:41:35.672 --> 1:41:37.466
I'll rip your legs off if I catch you!

1:41:45.682 --> 1:41:46.850
Got you!

1:42:13.544 --> 1:42:14.545
Get him!

1:42:14.628 --> 1:42:18.173
Why have you been trying to pick that up?
Just focus on fighting!

1:42:30.477 --> 1:42:31.520
What?

1:42:37.067 --> 1:42:38.026
What's this?

1:42:48.036 --> 1:42:49.580
Huh? It's the same.

1:42:57.880 --> 1:42:59.548
I have no excuses, Captain.

1:43:00.048 --> 1:43:01.717
We're alive? We're alive?

1:43:03.719 --> 1:43:04.803
And Hae-geum?

1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:29.494
There's pirates!

1:43:51.391 --> 1:43:53.769
-Prepare to die!
-You're all dead, dammit!

1:43:54.269 --> 1:43:56.021
Lose some weight.

1:44:42.150 --> 1:44:44.569
I found the treasure!

1:44:44.653 --> 1:44:45.696
Whoo!

1:44:45.779 --> 1:44:47.406
I found the treasure!

1:44:47.489 --> 1:44:48.323
I found the…

1:44:54.621 --> 1:44:55.539
Wait. So…

1:44:56.248 --> 1:44:57.207
Ah, shit.

1:44:58.292 --> 1:44:59.918
Birdies,

1:45:01.169 --> 1:45:02.129
just listen to me.

1:45:02.212 --> 1:45:04.589
I'm not saying I'm going to keep
this all for myself.

1:45:04.673 --> 1:45:07.175
I'm saying,
first, let's get off this island, huh?

1:45:07.259 --> 1:45:08.510
Then we divide it evenly.

1:45:09.970 --> 1:45:13.140
You should know I have
an enormous number of subordinates, okay?

1:45:17.394 --> 1:45:20.981
If I get caught here dillydallying…
It's… it's a waste of my-- Ow!

1:45:22.149 --> 1:45:23.233
How dare you!

1:45:29.156 --> 1:45:30.324
You're pushing your luck!

1:45:30.824 --> 1:45:32.034
I'm the Pirate King--

1:45:32.117 --> 1:45:33.035
Huh?

1:46:23.877 --> 1:46:27.005
Captain, the ship,
it's in terrible condition!

1:46:27.089 --> 1:46:29.174
We have to stop fighting
and repair it immediately!

1:46:47.776 --> 1:46:49.152
We must repair the ship.

1:46:49.236 --> 1:46:51.113
If this ship sinks, we'll all die!

1:46:51.196 --> 1:46:54.116
You're about to die, anyway.
So why do you care?

1:47:58.930 --> 1:48:00.056
I've returned.

1:48:01.183 --> 1:48:03.226
I'm here to save you all!

1:48:03.935 --> 1:48:06.480
It is I, Mak-yi, the Pirate King!

1:48:22.704 --> 1:48:23.914
Throw away your sword!

1:48:36.635 --> 1:48:38.553
Hold on tight.

1:48:39.137 --> 1:48:41.181
-Hold on tight.
-What's happening?

1:48:41.264 --> 1:48:43.683
Is a phoenix taking off
this time or something?

1:48:43.767 --> 1:48:45.101
Get down quickly!

1:48:50.857 --> 1:48:52.442
Hey. You okay?

1:49:00.617 --> 1:49:02.369
Why do I see two ships?

1:49:03.036 --> 1:49:03.912
You too?

1:49:04.412 --> 1:49:07.374
Yeah, but what's that sparkly thing?

1:49:07.457 --> 1:49:09.167
Did Joo Bang's ship survive?

1:49:10.335 --> 1:49:12.379
Is that all gold in that ship?

1:49:14.631 --> 1:49:15.840
Well, look at that.

1:49:16.675 --> 1:49:19.052
That's enough to build a new kingdom.

1:49:27.394 --> 1:49:28.436
Gold!

1:49:31.189 --> 1:49:32.732
Kill them all.

1:49:32.816 --> 1:49:33.650
Kill them all!

1:49:33.733 --> 1:49:35.944
Everybody, cross over!

1:49:41.741 --> 1:49:42.576
Captain!

1:49:43.118 --> 1:49:45.036
-Shoot at them!
-Hurry, Captain!

1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:46.371
Fire!

1:49:49.249 --> 1:49:50.584
Captain! Let's go!

1:49:50.667 --> 1:49:51.876
-Captain!
-No!

1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:53.253
Captain!

1:50:04.639 --> 1:50:05.765
I got you!

1:50:10.145 --> 1:50:11.146
Captain!

1:50:11.730 --> 1:50:12.606
Captain!

1:50:12.689 --> 1:50:15.400
Hey, hey. Don't touch there.
It hurts!

1:50:15.483 --> 1:50:17.777
God. I almost died.

1:50:18.862 --> 1:50:20.363
The captain's okay!

1:50:20.447 --> 1:50:21.364
Yeah!

1:50:24.576 --> 1:50:25.952
I'm still the captain!

1:50:28.079 --> 1:50:29.247
It's starting again.

1:50:29.331 --> 1:50:31.916
After a battle
against countless dragons in a sea cave,

1:50:33.710 --> 1:50:35.754
I brought these treasures.

1:50:38.048 --> 1:50:39.591
How many dragons were there?

1:50:39.674 --> 1:50:41.551
3,873.

1:50:42.135 --> 1:50:43.762
Now that we have the treasure,

1:50:43.845 --> 1:50:45.305
it's time to go home!

1:50:45.388 --> 1:50:48.266
Let's go home!

1:50:53.688 --> 1:50:54.773
What's that sound?

1:50:56.316 --> 1:50:57.192
What was that?

1:51:09.245 --> 1:51:11.039
A horde of dragons has awakened.

1:51:36.481 --> 1:51:38.108
Raise the sails!

1:53:22.170 --> 1:53:23.505
Captain!

1:53:24.339 --> 1:53:27.467
When I give the signal,
be sure to secure the sails!

1:53:28.051 --> 1:53:29.385
Yes, Captain!

1:53:30.595 --> 1:53:31.805
Everyone, get ready!

1:53:33.807 --> 1:53:35.683
Pull yourself together, men!

1:53:53.201 --> 1:53:54.160
Now pull!

1:53:55.870 --> 1:53:57.080
Pull!

1:54:14.389 --> 1:54:16.099
Someone help me!

1:55:06.649 --> 1:55:07.775
Are we alive?

1:55:08.276 --> 1:55:10.028
This must be the afterlife.

1:55:16.409 --> 1:55:18.620
We're alive! We're alive!

1:55:19.162 --> 1:55:21.789
We're alive!

1:55:22.582 --> 1:55:25.126
We're alive!

1:55:36.846 --> 1:55:39.349
So you made it, Captain!

1:55:39.849 --> 1:55:41.517
'Cause it's my turn now!

1:55:44.103 --> 1:55:45.188
Don't die on me,

1:55:46.272 --> 1:55:47.190
Wu Mu-chi.

1:55:54.489 --> 1:55:55.907
If I die on this mountain,

1:55:56.449 --> 1:55:57.659
will Rang remember me?

1:55:58.409 --> 1:55:59.369
I wonder.

1:56:17.720 --> 1:56:20.014
In the end, the strongest always wins.

1:56:24.268 --> 1:56:26.270
Wu Mu-chi!

1:57:11.816 --> 1:57:13.651
-Boss!
-Kang-seop!

1:57:16.154 --> 1:57:17.780
Wu Mu-chi succeeded as well.

1:57:20.616 --> 1:57:21.701
Look at this!

1:57:22.368 --> 1:57:23.953
I found the treasure!

1:57:28.750 --> 1:57:29.876
Huh?

1:57:36.215 --> 1:57:37.050
Hae-geum.

1:57:43.806 --> 1:57:44.724
Is she alive?

1:57:49.729 --> 1:57:51.272
Hey. Did you eat yet?

1:58:03.409 --> 1:58:05.161
I wonder what happened to Joo Bang.

1:58:05.870 --> 1:58:08.706
He wouldn't have been able
to leave the island without a boat.

1:58:09.791 --> 1:58:12.001
He's probably asleep
on the island somewhere,

1:58:12.085 --> 1:58:14.045
full of sorrow for his ruined country.

1:58:16.089 --> 1:58:17.090
What ruined country?

1:58:17.673 --> 1:58:18.925
Goryeo's been rebuilt.

1:58:19.592 --> 1:58:20.802
Joseon's it's name, now.

1:58:21.427 --> 1:58:23.429
A country is its people,

1:58:23.513 --> 1:58:25.389
the pillars of a thousand-year dynasty.

1:58:28.893 --> 1:58:31.896
So now that we found
the treasure, um…

1:58:32.438 --> 1:58:33.689
…what's Boss going to do?

1:58:33.773 --> 1:58:34.774
Boss?

1:58:35.691 --> 1:58:37.860
Well, if you insist
on staying on the ship,

1:58:37.944 --> 1:58:40.029
I'll have to rethink the leadership then.

1:58:46.119 --> 1:58:48.830
-What do you say?
-I need to think it over.

1:58:53.376 --> 1:58:55.253
How long are you going to think about it?

1:58:59.006 --> 1:59:00.716
Your vacation is over…

1:59:02.176 --> 1:59:03.136
Captain.

1:59:13.896 --> 1:59:14.856
Attention!

1:59:15.690 --> 1:59:17.024
Are you really leaving us?

1:59:18.401 --> 1:59:20.194
Do I have any other choice?

1:59:20.278 --> 1:59:22.572
You cannot have two dragons on one ship.

1:59:23.072 --> 1:59:25.658
If it is our fate,
I suppose we will meet again.

1:59:27.577 --> 1:59:29.537
As long as you're still
on the sea, Captain.

1:59:31.080 --> 1:59:33.666
But I'm confused. Where's the island here?

1:59:33.749 --> 1:59:35.626
I asked to be taken to a safe island.

1:59:36.961 --> 1:59:38.254
The island is over there.

1:59:38.963 --> 1:59:39.964
Where?

1:59:40.548 --> 1:59:41.716
That island.

1:59:41.799 --> 1:59:43.551
That's not an island, it's a rock.

1:59:46.304 --> 1:59:49.223
We paid particular attention
to the safety you mentioned.

1:59:49.307 --> 1:59:51.142
There are no mountain beasts
or wild animals.

1:59:51.225 --> 1:59:52.852
What's more, no soldiers either.

1:59:52.935 --> 1:59:53.853
Exactly!

1:59:55.062 --> 1:59:57.106
I assure you there's no safer place.

1:59:57.190 --> 1:59:58.274
He's right!

1:59:58.357 --> 2:00:00.985
When there's no fresh water,
or room to stretch your legs!

2:00:01.569 --> 2:00:04.071
There is no place
in this world that is perfect.

2:00:04.155 --> 2:00:05.072
Exactly!

2:00:07.909 --> 2:00:10.620
Joo Bang, rest in peace.

2:00:14.707 --> 2:00:18.502
'Cause we are honest bandits.
we'll use it well to help the common folk.

2:00:20.129 --> 2:00:22.673
So you didn't answer my question.

2:00:22.757 --> 2:00:23.883
Hmm?

2:00:23.966 --> 2:00:26.719
Ah.

2:00:32.642 --> 2:00:33.851
Oh, Hae-rang.

2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:36.687
-Hmm?
-Hey. Just stay still, will you?

2:00:37.688 --> 2:00:38.773
What?

2:00:41.484 --> 2:00:42.401
My answer.

2:00:43.319 --> 2:00:44.737
Are you saying you'll stay?

2:00:44.820 --> 2:00:46.364
The former Greatest Swordsman

2:00:47.031 --> 2:00:48.532
chooses to walk alongside you.

2:00:49.784 --> 2:00:50.826
Idiot.

2:00:52.870 --> 2:00:54.413
For me to know, you have to do this.

2:00:58.167 --> 2:00:59.293
Captain?

2:01:02.588 --> 2:01:03.756
Huh? What?

2:01:04.382 --> 2:01:05.591
Since when were those two…

2:01:05.675 --> 2:01:08.052
You didn't know?
While they were cutting fish heads.

2:01:09.887 --> 2:01:11.180
What's going on?

2:01:12.723 --> 2:01:13.849
Them too?

2:01:13.933 --> 2:01:16.102
What's the use of treasure, dammit?

2:01:16.185 --> 2:01:17.979
Ugh. I don't need any of this.

2:01:22.692 --> 2:01:24.819
Please, stop already! Stop!

2:01:24.902 --> 2:01:25.736
Come on!
