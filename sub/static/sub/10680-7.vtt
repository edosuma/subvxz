00:11.440 --> 00:13.360
[Dale]<i> Previously on</i> Cuckoo...

00:13.400 --> 00:17.000
So I was thinking

00:13.400 --> 00:17.000
this time around you might

00:13.400 --> 00:17.000
handle the baby duties.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.240
I don't think so.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.280
I'll do it. I'll take the

00:19.280 --> 00:22.280
paternity leave,

00:19.280 --> 00:22.280
stuff work.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.840
Mr. Xi is my new mentor.

00:23.880 --> 00:26.160
Dale, when you were

00:23.880 --> 00:26.160
a businessman...

00:26.600 --> 00:27.960
[groaning]

00:28.000 --> 00:30.640
...what area were you

00:28.000 --> 00:30.640
in exactly?

00:30.680 --> 00:35.040
Client facing, results oriented.

00:30.680 --> 00:35.040
Turns out you were right

00:30.680 --> 00:35.040
about that Triads thing.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.920
I was fairly sure.

00:36.960 --> 00:40.120
Could you tell me why

00:36.960 --> 00:40.120
my father's 1976 Triumph Stag

00:36.960 --> 00:40.120
is on the drive way?

00:40.160 --> 00:42.040
[Lorna] I sent an invite

00:40.160 --> 00:42.040
to your mom.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.080
Cooey!

00:43.120 --> 00:46.480
I've fallen

00:43.120 --> 00:46.480
for a truly special girl.

00:46.520 --> 00:49.440
-What's her name?

00:46.520 --> 00:49.440
-Ling. She's Mr. Xi's

00:46.520 --> 00:49.440
daughter, actually.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.760
He's obviously

00:49.480 --> 00:51.760
got feelings

00:49.480 --> 00:51.760
for you deep down.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.320
Annoyingly deep down.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.160
[groans]

00:55.080 --> 00:56.760
Dale!

00:56.800 --> 01:00.000
-You were jealous of me and him.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.000
-I love Ling.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.000
See previous conversation.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.760
-There's something

01:00.040 --> 01:02.760
I need to tell Kenneth.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.760
-Oh?

01:02.800 --> 01:06.280
Not one phone call, no letter,

01:02.800 --> 01:06.280
not one single email

01:02.800 --> 01:06.280
since I left China.

01:06.960 --> 01:08.080
Nothing.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.720
Come on, Belinda.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.480
-Alan was not

01:09.760 --> 01:12.480
your real father.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.480
-What?

01:19.600 --> 01:22.280
Aw, Sid.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.280
I miss that

01:19.600 --> 01:22.280
little guy.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.640
I don't.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.640
Not yet I don't.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.640
I hope your mom's

01:24.680 --> 01:26.640
all right with him.

01:28.360 --> 01:31.480
North? Why are we

01:28.360 --> 01:31.480
driving north?

01:28.360 --> 01:31.480
Where are we flying from?

01:31.520 --> 01:33.280
We're not flying

01:31.520 --> 01:33.280
anywhere, Dylly.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.240
We're going to Cumbria instead.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.240
They decided two weeks ago.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.560
That was serious?

01:36.280 --> 01:39.560
I thought that was

01:36.280 --> 01:39.560
one of Dad's shit jokes.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.000
Why the fuck

01:39.600 --> 01:42.000
would we go on holiday

01:39.600 --> 01:42.000
to Cumbria?

01:42.040 --> 01:43.120
Well...

01:43.160 --> 01:45.400
Why would anyone

01:43.160 --> 01:45.400
even pass through there?

01:45.440 --> 01:48.920
It's like... Well, I know

01:45.440 --> 01:48.920
nothing about it,

01:45.440 --> 01:48.920
that's how shit it is.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.480
You're going to spend

01:48.960 --> 01:52.480
a week with your family.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.480
Isn't that what matters?

01:52.520 --> 01:54.600
Well, I'm packed

01:52.520 --> 01:54.600
for Barbados,

01:52.520 --> 01:54.600
all right?

01:54.640 --> 01:56.840
So unless I'm going

01:54.640 --> 01:56.840
horse riding

01:54.640 --> 01:56.840
in Speedos,

01:56.880 --> 01:59.640
you can count me out

01:56.880 --> 01:59.640
of outdoor activities.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.640
Got my X-box.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.640
Bunch of twats.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.120
-Bagsie the master bedroom.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.120
-Absolutely not.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.480
Going against a bagsie?

02:09.160 --> 02:12.480
Bad karma, that's your holiday

02:09.160 --> 02:12.480
fucked, Dad.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.480
[groans]

02:13.520 --> 02:15.400
Insubordination.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.440
Right, this is gonna be

02:15.440 --> 02:18.440
a nice family holiday,

02:15.440 --> 02:18.440
isn't it?

02:18.480 --> 02:21.960
I suggest we all dump our bags,

02:18.480 --> 02:21.960
then we go for a lovely

02:18.480 --> 02:21.960
short walk...

02:22.000 --> 02:23.560
-Oh really?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.560
-No thanks

02:23.600 --> 02:25.280
Down the road

02:23.600 --> 02:25.280
to the local pub.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.600
[all] Ah!

02:26.640 --> 02:29.000
Not such a boring,

02:26.640 --> 02:29.000
Dad, now is he?

02:29.040 --> 02:32.360
-Oh, Dylan, you're not using

02:29.040 --> 02:32.360
our bathroom either.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.360
-Said Hitler.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.720
This is nice, isn't it?

02:34.840 --> 02:37.720
All the family together.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.960
Okay, so two groups.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.960
Group One: Mom and Dad,

02:40.840 --> 02:43.960
I do not know you.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.560
-Thanks, Dylan.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.560
-Charming.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.200
Group two. You guys.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.200
Dale you're my wingman,

02:45.600 --> 02:48.200
stay with me.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.040
You're the female friend

02:48.240 --> 02:51.040
that shows I've

02:48.240 --> 02:51.040
a sensitive side

02:51.080 --> 02:53.560
because I hang with you

02:51.080 --> 02:53.560
even though

02:51.080 --> 02:53.560
you're lame.

02:53.600 --> 02:57.320
-Yeah. Turning down that offer.

02:53.600 --> 02:57.320
-You could've been part of

02:53.600 --> 02:57.320
something great.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.720
Come on,

02:57.360 --> 02:58.720
you weirdo.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.080
I'm going

02:59.640 --> 03:01.080
to the loo.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.240
So, what do you

03:03.240 --> 03:07.240
think he's like?

03:03.240 --> 03:07.240
Your biological father.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.200
I don't know.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.200
From what Mom said,

03:07.280 --> 03:10.200
not too promising.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.760
Some Northern Casanova

03:10.240 --> 03:13.760
who latched on to her

03:10.240 --> 03:13.760
in a bar.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.280
Anyway, this is

03:13.800 --> 03:15.280
the place.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.040
I don't see

03:15.320 --> 03:18.040
why you have to be

03:15.320 --> 03:18.040
so underhand about it.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.400
Pretending to the kids

03:18.080 --> 03:20.400
we're on holiday.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.280
Don't you think

03:20.440 --> 03:23.280
you should've called

03:20.440 --> 03:23.280
your father first?

03:23.320 --> 03:25.840
-Let him know we were coming.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.840
-I've explained this.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.720
He must not know

03:25.880 --> 03:27.720
I'm his son.

03:27.760 --> 03:31.480
We meet him anonymously,

03:27.760 --> 03:31.480
then if we don't like him

03:27.760 --> 03:31.480
we can just walk away. Plan?

03:31.520 --> 03:32.520
-Plan.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.720
So what next?

03:35.760 --> 03:39.840
Well I guess we just

03:35.760 --> 03:39.840
wait for a tall,

03:35.760 --> 03:39.840
handsome older man

03:39.880 --> 03:45.600
with a keen intelligence shining

03:39.880 --> 03:45.600
through blue eyes. In the

03:39.880 --> 03:45.600
meantime, we get rat-arsed.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.560
-My kind of holiday.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.560
-Right.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.440
[whistling]

04:01.640 --> 04:02.560
Hello?

04:06.040 --> 04:07.480
[grunting]

04:08.960 --> 04:12.760
-Steve! What are you

04:08.960 --> 04:12.760
doing here?

04:08.960 --> 04:12.760
-Neighborhood watch.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.360
-What are you doing here?

04:12.800 --> 04:16.360
-Ken asked me

04:12.800 --> 04:16.360
to water the plants.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.160
-Neighborhood watch?

04:16.400 --> 04:19.160
-Holidays are folly.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.680
Thieves target homes

04:19.200 --> 04:21.680
when their owners are away.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.880
But if they try this one,

04:21.720 --> 04:24.880
they've me to contend with.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.600
-Get off!

04:24.920 --> 04:27.600
-Come on, big boy,

04:24.920 --> 04:27.600
take a shot at me.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.440
Come on, come on.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.160
Wait. Are those

04:29.480 --> 04:32.160
Ken's pajamas?

04:32.200 --> 04:35.800
Yeah. Of course.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.800
I don't own a pair.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.800
I sleep nude.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.640
Right, I think

04:35.840 --> 04:38.640
I'm gonna have

04:35.840 --> 04:38.640
to call Ken

04:38.680 --> 04:40.800
and tell him

04:38.680 --> 04:40.800
you've broken

04:38.680 --> 04:40.800
into his house.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.120
[shushing]

04:42.160 --> 04:46.960
Or you could

04:42.160 --> 04:46.960
jump into a spare

04:42.160 --> 04:46.960
pair of jim-jams

04:47.000 --> 04:49.760
and watch Ken and Lorna's

04:47.000 --> 04:49.760
wedding video with me.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.160
Trust me,

04:49.800 --> 04:52.160
it is a cracker.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.880
Fuck it.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.880
It's Saturday.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.640
So yeah I'm from

04:57.760 --> 05:00.640
the mean streets

04:57.760 --> 05:00.640
of Lichfield.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.680
It's like Compton, LA,

05:00.680 --> 05:03.680
but it's got this

05:00.680 --> 05:03.680
banging cathedral.

05:03.720 --> 05:10.120
So yeah, uni was just like...

05:03.720 --> 05:10.120
Nah! Bigger things, you know,

05:03.720 --> 05:10.120
bigger dreams, ghetto dreams...

05:11.480 --> 05:13.200
So what do you do?

05:13.240 --> 05:16.480
Oh, I used to be a

05:13.240 --> 05:16.480
businessperson.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.480
Now I'm a nanny.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.360
Wow! So you have

05:16.520 --> 05:19.360
a sensitive side.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.840
-Hey, who wants

05:20.760 --> 05:23.840
another drink?

05:20.760 --> 05:23.840
-Dale, come with me.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.400
You need to scram.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.400
You're killing

05:23.880 --> 05:26.400
my vibes, bitch.

05:26.440 --> 05:31.040
But Dylan, the thing is like,

05:26.440 --> 05:31.040
if Ling's forgotten about me,

05:31.080 --> 05:33.680
I kinda got to start

05:31.080 --> 05:33.680
putting myself out there.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.720
Here's an idea.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.720
Why don't you go

05:33.720 --> 05:36.720
and get off with Rachel?

05:36.760 --> 05:38.360
[laughs]

05:38.400 --> 05:40.800
Have you been

05:38.400 --> 05:40.800
smoking too much

05:38.400 --> 05:40.800
of your pot-weeds?

05:40.840 --> 05:43.560
Do you not remember?

05:40.840 --> 05:43.560
Rachel said no to me

05:40.840 --> 05:43.560
at Christmas.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.600
Maybe she

05:43.600 --> 05:45.600
changed her mind.

05:45.640 --> 05:50.080
-What?

05:45.640 --> 05:50.080
-Oh come on. Have you

05:45.640 --> 05:50.080
seriously not seen it?

05:52.200 --> 05:53.680
Why has no one

05:52.200 --> 05:53.680
told me this?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.080
Oh, my goodness.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.440
I may need to

05:57.960 --> 06:01.440
run back to the house

05:57.960 --> 06:01.440
and clear my head.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.800
Yeah, yeah,

06:01.480 --> 06:02.800
great idea.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.760
Okay.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.840
-Dale!

06:05.320 --> 06:06.840
-Yeah?

06:06.880 --> 06:08.160
[muttering]

06:08.200 --> 06:11.880
-All right?

06:08.200 --> 06:11.880
-I'll see you

06:08.200 --> 06:11.880
back at the ranch.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.560
Does Dale know

06:11.920 --> 06:13.560
his way back home?

06:13.600 --> 06:15.320
He'll run around

06:13.600 --> 06:15.320
till he finds it.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.520
Shout me a drink, would you?

06:15.360 --> 06:18.520
For I am a-hunting

06:15.360 --> 06:18.520
the northern fox.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.520
Lorna looks

06:23.880 --> 06:25.520
so beautiful.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.440
I'm misty eyed, Steve.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.120
You know, I once thought

06:28.480 --> 06:31.120
that me and Rachel...

06:31.160 --> 06:36.040
[burping]

06:31.160 --> 06:36.040
You still hung up

06:31.160 --> 06:36.040
about that?

06:36.080 --> 06:38.160
They're off

06:36.080 --> 06:38.160
in Cumbria together.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.560
Moonlit walks.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.560
Romantic pies.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.160
Rachel's lost

06:41.600 --> 06:45.160
in this dramatic

06:41.600 --> 06:45.160
fantasy of her and Dale.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.600
What she doesn't realize is

06:45.200 --> 06:49.600
that real romance

06:45.200 --> 06:49.600
requires a cool head.

06:49.640 --> 06:53.920
Weighing up the pros

06:49.640 --> 06:53.920
and cons. There is

06:49.640 --> 06:53.920
a place for spreadsheets.

06:53.960 --> 06:58.400
I fell for Connie

06:53.960 --> 06:58.400
the moment I saw her.

06:53.960 --> 06:58.400
First three months, idyllic.

06:58.440 --> 07:02.320
And I woke up one morning

06:58.440 --> 07:02.320
and saw her face

06:58.440 --> 07:02.320
sleeping on the pillow.

07:02.360 --> 07:06.040
And I realized

07:02.360 --> 07:06.040
I hated her.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.480
I walked out.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.480
Then I realized

07:06.080 --> 07:09.480
I loved her again,

07:09.520 --> 07:12.600
I got some crumpets,

07:09.520 --> 07:12.600
came back before

07:09.520 --> 07:12.600
she woke up.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.000
We had a

07:12.640 --> 07:14.000
pleasant breakfast.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.640
The point is,

07:15.640 --> 07:19.640
that's the cycle

07:15.640 --> 07:19.640
of life, Ben.

07:19.680 --> 07:24.120
True love passes

07:19.680 --> 07:24.120
through your passage

07:19.680 --> 07:24.120
like a thunderbolt.

07:25.560 --> 07:28.120
Love's just

07:25.560 --> 07:28.120
compatibility, Steve.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.080
I don't believe

07:28.160 --> 07:30.080
in thunderbolts.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.040
[doorbell ringing]

07:38.440 --> 07:41.000
Uh, hi.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.800
[speaking Cantonese]

07:42.840 --> 07:46.880
My father wishes to speak

07:42.840 --> 07:46.880
to Dale. Does he live here?

07:42.840 --> 07:46.880
It's urgent.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.960
Am I right in thinking

07:50.800 --> 07:54.960
that Jack Spreckley

07:50.800 --> 07:54.960
drinks in here?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.040
Apparently, he won

07:55.000 --> 07:58.040
your pool competition

07:55.000 --> 07:58.040
about four years ago.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.560
We looked

07:58.080 --> 07:59.560
him up on Google.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.520
Big Jack! Why do you

07:59.600 --> 08:02.520
want to see Big Jack?

08:02.560 --> 08:04.920
-Ken's Big Jack's son.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.920
-Lorna!

08:04.960 --> 08:09.760
-His son. Well, sorry mate,

08:04.960 --> 08:09.760
you'll not see Big Jack tonight.

08:04.960 --> 08:09.760
-Oh, why's that?

08:09.800 --> 08:14.400
He died. Potted the black

08:09.800 --> 08:14.400
and keeled over

08:09.800 --> 08:14.400
at the same moment, last year.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.800
Ken, is it? I tell you what,

08:14.440 --> 08:18.800
pop in tomorrow early doors.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.960
I'd be happy to chat

08:18.840 --> 08:20.960
about the old bastard.

08:26.120 --> 08:32.520
Well, there we are, Lorna.

08:26.120 --> 08:32.520
Dead. That's that.

08:26.120 --> 08:32.520
Honestly, my bloody mother.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.800
Do you want to

08:32.560 --> 08:33.800
go back?

08:34.960 --> 08:37.520
No, let's get pissed.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.200
So you're a Triad?

08:54.680 --> 08:56.280
[speaking Cantonese]

08:56.320 --> 08:59.880
My darling daughter

08:56.320 --> 08:59.880
who is my moon and joy,

08:56.320 --> 08:59.880
has persuaded me

08:59.920 --> 09:04.320
her love for Dale

08:59.920 --> 09:04.320
has not changed and I must

08:59.920 --> 09:04.320
allow their marriage.

09:04.360 --> 09:09.320
Really? So you're going

09:04.360 --> 09:09.320
to get Dale, marry him,

09:09.360 --> 09:13.880
and then take him

09:09.360 --> 09:13.880
back to China?

09:09.360 --> 09:13.880
Fantastic news.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.320
-[speaking Cantonese]

09:13.920 --> 09:16.320
-[Ling translating] So,

09:16.360 --> 09:18.320
where is Dale?

09:18.360 --> 09:21.920
Unfortunately,

09:18.360 --> 09:21.920
he's not here

09:18.360 --> 09:21.920
right now.

09:21.960 --> 09:26.240
They've gone on holiday.

09:21.960 --> 09:26.240
To Cumbria.

09:21.960 --> 09:26.240
He'll be back in five days.

09:27.560 --> 09:31.240
Five days?

09:27.560 --> 09:31.240
Five days!

09:31.280 --> 09:32.800
[speaking Cantonese]

09:35.200 --> 09:37.720
Economy arse ache!

09:37.760 --> 09:39.360
[Ling speaking Cantonese]

09:39.400 --> 09:41.080
Who feed the cat?

09:41.120 --> 09:45.200
If you need to get

09:41.120 --> 09:45.200
to Cumbria, it's not far.

09:41.120 --> 09:45.200
You can drive there.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.440
You!

09:48.840 --> 09:49.640
You drive!

09:50.360 --> 09:51.160
Me?

09:57.280 --> 09:58.680
It would be

09:57.280 --> 09:58.680
an honor, sir.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.280
Have you...

10:03.680 --> 10:04.680
Killed anybody?

10:07.840 --> 10:11.560
What's

10:07.840 --> 10:11.560
the ideal number

10:07.840 --> 10:11.560
of henchmen?'

10:13.040 --> 10:17.200
Do you possess

10:13.040 --> 10:17.200
a secret bunker,

10:13.040 --> 10:17.200
and if so where?

10:18.520 --> 10:19.840
[speaking Cantonese]

10:21.920 --> 10:26.200
My father says, this

10:21.920 --> 10:26.200
is his holiday. He does not

10:21.920 --> 10:26.200
wish to talk about business.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.960
Penultimate question.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.960
Do you like

10:29.280 --> 10:32.960
martial arts movies?

10:35.240 --> 10:37.920
<i>Master of</i>

10:35.240 --> 10:37.920
<i>the Flying Guillotine.</i>

10:39.720 --> 10:41.520
Now, you're talking

10:39.720 --> 10:41.520
to me, baby.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.920
Now. You're.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.920
Talking. To. Me.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.920
Baby.

10:43.960 --> 10:44.920
Boom!

10:48.000 --> 10:52.040
We're almost there,

10:48.000 --> 10:52.040
we made good time.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.040
Ladies and gentlemen.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.720
-Brampton, Norfolk.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.720
-Brampton, Cumbria, Steve.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.400
Oh, for fuck's sake.

11:01.440 --> 11:06.480
-Don't you want me baby!

11:01.440 --> 11:06.480
-Sing the chorus, sing the...

11:07.480 --> 11:08.840
You're supposed

11:07.480 --> 11:08.840
to love me.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.240
I'll prove

11:09.800 --> 11:11.240
that you love me.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.600
-Good night.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.360
[muffled chattering]

11:14.400 --> 11:17.000
Dylan's still trying

11:14.400 --> 11:17.000
to turn it round

11:14.400 --> 11:17.000
with that girl.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.240
Gotta give him credit.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.240
Hey, what's wrong

11:17.040 --> 11:20.240
with you?

11:20.280 --> 11:23.120
You're usually

11:20.280 --> 11:23.120
chatty with a pint

11:20.280 --> 11:23.120
inside you.

11:23.160 --> 11:28.720
Oh, um, okay. Rachel.

11:23.160 --> 11:28.720
Would you want to go

11:23.160 --> 11:28.720
on a walk with me

11:28.760 --> 11:31.280
to Hadrian's Wall?

11:28.760 --> 11:31.280
It's a very famous wall.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.640
It's a nice wall,

11:31.320 --> 11:33.640
nice wall.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.640
Yeah, that'd be cool.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.640
That'd be right up

11:33.680 --> 11:37.640
Dad's street too.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.360
Probably give us

11:37.680 --> 11:39.360
a lift.

11:39.400 --> 11:43.360
Oh maybe just the two of us.

11:39.400 --> 11:43.360
Just go on a walk,

11:39.400 --> 11:43.360
just the two of us.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.520
Yeah.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.160
-Tomorrow

11:44.560 --> 11:46.160
-Okay. Sure.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.000
Copy.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.600
[Ben] So, Ling,

11:53.120 --> 11:56.600
what brings you

11:53.120 --> 11:56.600
to England?

11:56.640 --> 12:01.720
Well, when my dad found out

11:56.640 --> 12:01.720
about Dale, he sent me

11:56.640 --> 12:01.720
to the countryside.

12:01.760 --> 12:06.200
There was no Internet.

12:01.760 --> 12:06.200
No way of talking to Dale.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.720
I have a dream that Dale

12:06.240 --> 12:09.720
and I could move back

12:06.240 --> 12:09.720
to England together.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.600
I could get a steady job

12:09.760 --> 12:12.600
in a mid-level law firm.

12:12.640 --> 12:16.920
-But, that's what I do.

12:12.640 --> 12:16.920
-Really? You are so lucky.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.680
Yes. I really am.

12:18.720 --> 12:24.480
I dream of a quiet

12:18.720 --> 12:24.480
English life, drinking

12:18.720 --> 12:24.480
lager in your English pubs.

12:24.520 --> 12:29.080
Maybe the occasional trip

12:24.520 --> 12:29.080
to London to see the latest

12:24.520 --> 12:29.080
Ed Sheeran's concert.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.560
Ed Sheeran.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.560
Shamefully

12:29.120 --> 12:31.560
under-rated.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.320
We'd have a little house

12:31.600 --> 12:35.320
in the provinces.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.320
Purpose-built.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.120
Period's prettier, but...

12:37.160 --> 12:39.320
[both] Pretty doesn't

12:37.160 --> 12:39.320
pay the heating bills.

12:44.640 --> 12:50.560
Ben, has anyone ever told you?

12:44.640 --> 12:50.560
You look like David Beckham.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.640
No. No one

12:50.600 --> 12:53.640
has ever said

12:50.600 --> 12:53.640
that to me.

12:55.720 --> 12:59.360
Awesome!

12:55.720 --> 12:59.360
I'll put a bit

12:55.720 --> 12:59.360
of radio.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.560
["Thinking Out Loud" playing]

13:11.040 --> 13:12.760
I actually feel

13:11.040 --> 13:12.760
kind of relieved.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.200
Hmm?

13:14.240 --> 13:17.360
That Ling never

13:14.240 --> 13:17.360
replied to any

13:14.240 --> 13:17.360
of my emails.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.760
Dale, there's something

13:17.400 --> 13:20.760
I should probably tell you.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.840
No. There's actually something

13:20.800 --> 13:23.840
I want to tell you too.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.040
-Yeah, okay.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.040
-Okay.

13:27.160 --> 13:31.360
Look, I pride myself

13:27.160 --> 13:31.360
on my perceptiveness

13:33.040 --> 13:37.400
but all these months,

13:33.040 --> 13:37.400
it seems I haven't

13:33.040 --> 13:37.400
been able to see

13:37.440 --> 13:39.200
what's staring me

13:37.440 --> 13:39.200
right in the face.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.120
Right.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.240
It's you.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.440

it was weird

-Nothing.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.000

14:19.040 --> 14:20.360
He loves those plants.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.440
That's incredible,

14:25.680 --> 14:27.440
isn't it?

14:27.480 --> 14:30.480
-Look at that!

14:27.480 --> 14:30.480
-Big Jack's son, eh?

-I do see

-They're dead ringers.

-Well, well...

14:33.360 --> 14:38.040
There you go.

14:33.360 --> 14:38.040
-Thanks very much.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.600
No problem.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.600
You're still paying

14:38.080 --> 14:40.600
for that by the way.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.240
Oh, yeah.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.360
And Jack owed me

14:42.280 --> 14:45.360
forty quid when

14:42.280 --> 14:45.360
he died, so...

14:45.400 --> 14:47.640
-Oh I don't think I've...

14:45.400 --> 14:47.640
-Joking you there...

14:49.280 --> 14:51.440
So what is it

14:49.280 --> 14:51.440
you want to know?

14:51.480 --> 14:54.560
Well, I mean, everything.

14:51.480 --> 14:54.560
What he did for a living?

14:54.600 --> 14:59.760
Well, in his youth,

14:54.600 --> 14:59.760
he raced cars

14:54.600 --> 14:59.760
for a living.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.640
And he was

14:59.800 --> 15:03.640
a drinker, a brilliant

14:59.800 --> 15:03.640
but tortured man.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.600
The lover of many

15:03.680 --> 15:05.600
beautiful women.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.360
Okay.

15:08.400 --> 15:13.280
Then, when he stopped racing,

15:08.400 --> 15:13.280
I don't know, it was like he'd

15:08.400 --> 15:13.280
lost all direction in his life.

15:13.320 --> 15:14.400
[both] Ah.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.440
So he traveled

15:14.440 --> 15:16.440
the world.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.440
Every adventure

15:16.480 --> 15:18.440
you can imagine.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.280
Eventually he came back

15:18.480 --> 15:21.280
and settled

15:18.480 --> 15:21.280
in his old home town

15:21.320 --> 15:23.680
drinking out his days

15:21.320 --> 15:23.680
with his old school pals,

15:23.720 --> 15:25.480
banging out tunes

15:23.720 --> 15:25.480
on the old Joanna.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.560
I bet you do

15:27.360 --> 15:30.560
something exciting

15:27.360 --> 15:30.560
in your life, don't you, eh?

15:31.280 --> 15:33.680
It's in the genes, eh?

15:37.400 --> 15:41.760
-I'm a solicitor

15:37.400 --> 15:41.760
on the High Street.

15:37.400 --> 15:41.760
-On paternity leave.

15:41.800 --> 15:48.000
Right. Still I'm sure you've got

15:41.800 --> 15:48.000
some good stories to say about

15:41.800 --> 15:48.000
your life, eh?

15:48.040 --> 15:51.880
Big Jack used to keep

15:48.040 --> 15:51.880
this pub entertained

15:48.040 --> 15:51.880
for hours.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.520
Tell him

15:51.920 --> 15:54.520
some exciting stories

15:51.920 --> 15:54.520
from your life.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.360
Do it. Do it.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.400
Well, I...

16:05.240 --> 16:06.040
Um...

16:10.280 --> 16:14.840
-That was another level,

16:10.280 --> 16:14.840
-Top lovemaking

16:10.280 --> 16:14.840
from you there, Rachel.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.200
Thank you.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.240
[cell phone pinging]

16:20.280 --> 16:22.280
-Your phone!

16:20.280 --> 16:22.280
-Oh, no, Dale...

16:22.320 --> 16:24.800
Oh it's just Ben.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.800
He says Ling is coming.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.960
Ling is coming.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.960
What is this?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.320
Ling is almost here?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.320
What is this?

16:29.360 --> 16:35.040
Oh! Yeah, Ben called

16:29.360 --> 16:35.040
but I must've forgotten

16:29.360 --> 16:35.040
in the heat of passion.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.320
What? How could you

16:35.080 --> 16:38.320
forget about that?

16:38.360 --> 16:41.320
Oh, no, no, no,

16:38.360 --> 16:41.320
I have cheated on

16:38.360 --> 16:41.320
somebody who loves me.

16:41.360 --> 16:44.120
This is not good.

16:41.360 --> 16:44.120
This is not good, Dale!

16:44.160 --> 16:46.560
Dale, you haven't

16:44.160 --> 16:46.560
done anything wrong.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.960
Why would she not send word

16:46.600 --> 16:48.960
that she's coming?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.800
How could she just

16:49.000 --> 16:50.800
turn up like this?

16:51.760 --> 16:53.600
[sighs]

16:53.640 --> 16:59.480
Yeah, Dale, a couple of

16:53.640 --> 16:59.480
weeks back, there was

16:53.640 --> 16:59.480
a letter from China.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.720
-What?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.720
A letter for me?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.720
-Mm-Hmm

17:01.760 --> 17:04.280
Have you been

17:01.760 --> 17:04.280
hiding this from me

17:01.760 --> 17:04.280
the whole time?

17:04.320 --> 17:05.920
I wanted you

17:04.320 --> 17:05.920
to forget about her.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.520
I love you, Dale.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.040
You've done bad, Rachel.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.560
I don't know

17:27.520 --> 17:29.560
why you have to

17:27.520 --> 17:29.560
hit me, Lorn.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.720
Well I can't sleep,

17:29.600 --> 17:31.720
you sound like a hippo.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.040
[sobbing]

17:35.640 --> 17:37.480
Dale's going away, mom!

17:38.680 --> 17:41.240
He's going back

17:38.680 --> 17:41.240
to China with Ling.

17:41.880 --> 17:42.680
[Rachel sobbing]

17:43.800 --> 17:45.080
Oh Rach.

17:48.680 --> 17:49.840
[car honking]

18:20.200 --> 18:21.680
So this is nice.

18:24.240 --> 18:27.200
Sorry, when I feel awkward

18:24.240 --> 18:27.200
I just keep

18:24.240 --> 18:27.200
chatting my head off.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.360
And this is awkward.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.360
What about some cake?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.280
Would some tasty cake

18:29.400 --> 18:32.280
stop anybody

18:29.400 --> 18:32.280
feeling weird?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.680
Mr. Zii,

18:32.320 --> 18:33.680
can I offer you...

18:33.720 --> 18:37.160
Zee. It's Mr. Xi

18:33.720 --> 18:37.160
as in zee.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.480
Sorry Mr. Xi,

18:37.200 --> 18:40.480
would you like

18:37.200 --> 18:40.480
some sticky bun?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.160
[speaking Cantonese]

18:42.200 --> 18:44.680
My father is

18:42.200 --> 18:44.680
not hungry

18:42.200 --> 18:44.680
or thirsty.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.840
-Well, fair enough.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.840
-I'll take one.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.200
Where is Dale?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.120
[speaking Cantonese]

19:04.160 --> 19:07.720
My father wants

19:04.160 --> 19:07.720
Dale to know he has

19:04.160 --> 19:07.720
decided to be merciful

19:07.760 --> 19:12.320
and let him marry me.

19:07.760 --> 19:12.320
Dale will fly to Shanghai,

19:07.760 --> 19:12.320
and he will join the family.

19:16.560 --> 19:21.560
Mr. Xi, I truly

19:16.560 --> 19:21.560
am honored.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.200
But I have to be honest,

19:27.880 --> 19:32.640
I'm in love with Rachel.

19:27.880 --> 19:32.640
I think I always was.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.080
Hi.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.080
Oh it's lovely

19:38.320 --> 19:40.080
to meet you.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.200
Yeah.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.520
[speaking in Cantonese]

19:42.640 --> 19:46.520
No! Come with me

19:42.640 --> 19:46.520
as Ling's suitor.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.000
You will rise through the ranks,

19:48.040 --> 19:49.880
you will have a good job,

19:48.040 --> 19:49.880
and make a good living.

19:50.640 --> 19:51.440
Thank you.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.880
But I actually like

19:52.760 --> 19:54.880
being a nanny better.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.280
This is where

19:56.960 --> 19:58.280
I belong.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.640
It's okay.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.800
It is?

20:02.840 --> 20:05.840
If you love Rachel,

20:02.840 --> 20:05.840
it is right

20:02.840 --> 20:05.840
we are not together.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.960
Well, great.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.960
That's fantastic.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.680
Maybe we can all

20:14.000 --> 20:15.680
go down the pub?

20:15.720 --> 20:18.000
-No! No!

20:15.720 --> 20:18.000
-[Ling screaming]

20:18.040 --> 20:19.920
[speaking Cantonese]

20:19.960 --> 20:22.200
My daughter

20:19.960 --> 20:22.200
not good enough

20:19.960 --> 20:22.200
for you?

20:22.240 --> 20:24.840
We're here to

20:22.240 --> 20:24.840
find husband.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.840
She have husband!

20:24.880 --> 20:26.880
[speaking Cantonese]

20:26.920 --> 20:31.560
Erm... My father says you should

20:26.920 --> 20:31.560
reconsider and do not embarrass

20:26.920 --> 20:31.560
him a second time, Dale.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.800
Because if so...

20:32.840 --> 20:34.560
[speaking Cantonese]

20:34.600 --> 20:37.040
He must kill

20:34.600 --> 20:37.040
all new family members.

20:37.080 --> 20:39.280
[speaking Cantonese]

20:40.280 --> 20:43.640
Apart from Steve Chance

20:40.280 --> 20:43.640
who's ace.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.560
Thank you.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.560
Uh, sorry.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.200
Gotta go.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.560
You know what?

20:48.240 --> 20:50.560
On second thought,

20:48.240 --> 20:50.560
I think

20:50.600 --> 20:53.240
I should probably

20:50.600 --> 20:53.240
go back to China

20:50.600 --> 20:53.240
and marry Ling.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.960
[all agreeing simultaneously]

20:56.000 --> 20:59.840
Good idea, Dale.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.840
Brilliant idea. Thank you.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.840
You should definitely get...

21:00.800 --> 21:02.960
We take your car,

21:00.800 --> 21:02.960
Steve Chance.

21:05.720 --> 21:06.520
Wait.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.080
Wait.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.080
Take me with you.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.080
Train me.

21:12.120 --> 21:15.960
As a Triad. I want to help you

21:12.120 --> 21:15.960
extend your business

21:12.120 --> 21:15.960
beyond the Yangtze.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.280
Up into the frozen north.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.880
Or failing that,

21:20.920 --> 21:24.840
Lichfield is currently

21:20.920 --> 21:24.840
without Triad representation.

21:20.920 --> 21:24.840
That would suit equally. Please.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.120
[speaking Cantonese]

21:26.160 --> 21:28.280
My father says

21:26.160 --> 21:28.280
you are a merry

21:26.160 --> 21:28.280
little fellow.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.480
-Thank you.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.480
-But weak.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.720
Oh.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.840
[speaking Cantonese]

21:33.880 --> 21:36.640
Take his gun. Take it

21:33.880 --> 21:36.640
in memory of friendship.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.360
We shall always

21:38.560 --> 21:41.360
have Cumbria.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.360
And Norfolk.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.160
-Who goes there?

21:53.480 --> 21:56.160
-Woah!

21:56.200 --> 21:57.880
What is going on?

21:57.920 --> 22:00.720
Ling's dad has arrived

21:57.920 --> 22:00.720
and he's insisting

21:57.920 --> 22:00.720
that Dale--

22:00.760 --> 22:04.000
No, what are you doing here?

22:00.760 --> 22:04.000
I need the house. I sent a text.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.440
Oh, for fuck's sake.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.160
Chief Ken.

22:19.720 --> 22:20.520
Lorna.

22:26.920 --> 22:27.720
[sighs]

22:32.160 --> 22:33.960
Dylan. I'm gonna

22:32.160 --> 22:33.960
miss you.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.280
-Ha, ha! Got you back,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.280
you twat!

22:34.000 --> 22:36.280
-Dylan.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.960
What? It's our thing.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.920
I can't believe

22:43.280 --> 22:44.920
this is goodbye.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.280
I hope one day

22:46.880 --> 22:49.280
we'll meet again

22:46.880 --> 22:49.280
in another life.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.640
Yeah.

22:51.480 --> 22:52.880
Maybe as eagles.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.360
Rach. I'm so sorry.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.520
-Come on.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.520
-Yeah.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.160
-Fancy coming to my room.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.160
-Okay.

23:35.920 --> 23:40.240
You'd best come inside.

23:35.920 --> 23:40.240
You okay, love?

23:40.280 --> 23:45.320
Just a bit short of breath.

23:40.280 --> 23:45.320
I left my Ventolin at home,

23:40.280 --> 23:45.320
so it's probably...

23:45.360 --> 23:47.680
All right, well,

23:45.360 --> 23:47.680
come on then.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.560
No, Lorna, do you believe

23:47.720 --> 23:50.560
in love at first sight?

23:50.600 --> 23:53.120
-Yes! Obvs!

23:50.600 --> 23:53.120
-I mean like

23:50.600 --> 23:53.120
a thunderbolt?

23:53.160 --> 23:56.240
-Completely irrational?

23:53.160 --> 23:56.240
-You okay?

23:53.160 --> 23:56.240
Your face has gone weird.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.360
Lorna, I'm not

23:56.280 --> 23:59.360
Rachel's bestie.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.360
I'm not anyone's bestie.

24:01.960 --> 24:05.680
Because I love Ling.

24:05.720 --> 24:11.160
