01:30.891 --> 01:32.159
We can get an apartment!

01:32.159 --> 01:33.861
- Oh, terrific!
- Okay, where would it be?

01:33.861 --> 01:35.294
The Three Musketeers ride again.

01:35.295 --> 01:36.530
Heck yeah!

01:36.530 --> 01:38.521
The Three Musketeers!

01:40.801 --> 01:42.836
- Cute, Al. Cute.
- G reat.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.338
- Let's find an apartment.
- Right.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.173
Well, getting
your own apartment, huh?

01:46.173 --> 01:47.341
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.643
I can still remember
my first place.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.379
Big bed, mirrors on the ceiling.

01:52.379 --> 01:55.582
Mirrors? It must have been
pretty wild.

01:55.582 --> 01:57.050
No, I hardly got any rest.

01:57.051 --> 01:59.385
All night long,
I kept peeking up in the mirror

01:59.386 --> 02:01.377
to see if I was asleep.

02:02.322 --> 02:03.924
Neato story, Al.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.187
Let's find an apartment.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.217
Here's a couple of places.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.340
Somebody named Crash
been looking for me?

02:20.340 --> 02:23.276
Crash? You're meeting somebody
by the name of Crash

02:23.277 --> 02:25.546
here in my unbroken-up
restaurant?

02:25.546 --> 02:27.715
Just relax now, Al.

02:27.715 --> 02:31.652
When Crash gets in here, just
say I'll be right over there.

02:37.458 --> 02:41.417
Nice. Very, very nice,
but you're Thursday.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.599
- Oh, hey, Fonz.
- Fonz!

02:45.599 --> 02:47.201
- Hey.
- Fonz, guess what?

02:47.201 --> 02:50.037
- We're gonna be getting
an apartment of our own. -Yeah.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.305
Yeah, Fonz, you know, a place

02:51.305 --> 02:53.207
where we can operate
with a lot of belle femmes.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.408
- Yeah.
-(chuckles)

02:54.408 --> 02:55.709
Oh, that's terrific, Malphie.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.144
I hope they have
some special closets

02:57.144 --> 02:58.873
for your rubber noses.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.682
Fonz, we're really desperate.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.850
Couldn't you help us
find a place?

03:02.850 --> 03:05.986
Hey, the Fonz does not dabble
in real estate.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.454
Cars and chicks, you understand?

03:07.454 --> 03:09.523
Cars and chicks.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.925
Now, you get in touch
with my cousin Chachi,

03:11.925 --> 03:15.054
'cause he's got info
on everything.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.967
Hi, Fonz.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.958
FONZIE:
Hey, Crash.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.676
Crash, you kill me.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.611
I wouldn't mind crashing
into her sometime.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.602
(Potsie laughs)

03:33.647 --> 03:36.116
I love her bumpers.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.423
Hey, Al, have you seen Chachi?

03:43.423 --> 03:45.292
Yeah, Fonzie's letting him
use his office.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.161
- I'll go get him for you.
- POTSIE: Great.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.196
Hey, Chachi?

03:49.196 --> 03:51.358
Front and center.
The guys want you.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.305
CHACHI:
Hey. guys.

03:58.305 --> 03:59.940
Have I got a deal for you.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.408
Chachi's sweater bonanza.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.011
Cashmere sweaters
made of genuine Orlon.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.479
No, no. No sweaters.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.014
We're looking for an apartment.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.483
- For $60 a month or less.
- Right.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.984
For less, you can live
in this bag.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.787
Well, $60, that's it.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.322
- I got just the apartment.
- Yeah, right.

04:15.322 --> 04:17.825
Oh, sure, except we don't
want one made out of Orlon.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.192
We don't want just anything.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.060
- Yeah, we're looking
for someplace special. -Mm.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.462
Does it have its own bathroom?

04:22.462 --> 04:24.898
Are you kidding?
Sure, it's got a bathroom.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.889
- That's the one.
- Let's go. Let's go.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.204
CHACHI: Wait till you see it.
You won't believe it.

04:31.205 --> 04:34.004
It's got everything
you ever wanted.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.379
- Reversible doorknob.
- Ah.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.747
This is all right!

04:40.747 --> 04:42.482
It's big, Pots.
Just what we wanted!

04:42.482 --> 04:43.917
- All right, guys?
- Great. Yeah.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.886
Modern kitchen,
walk-in closets,

04:45.886 --> 04:47.187
Southern exposure.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.588
You'll wish you grew up here.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.891
- It's great. -It's better
than my room at home.

04:50.891 --> 04:54.061
Yeah, it's nice, Chachi.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.429
Were there any survivors?

04:55.429 --> 04:57.231
Hey, watch what you say
about this place.

04:57.231 --> 04:58.999
- My mother's the landlady,
you know. -All right.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.834
All right.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.869
A pay telephone
in the living room?

05:02.870 --> 05:05.498
Look at the bright side, Pots.
No phone bills.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.075
Oh, boy.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.744
There's a bathroom
that should be outside.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.779
Hey, will you tell me one thing?

05:12.779 --> 05:14.748
Why did they paint
the kitchen orange?

05:14.748 --> 05:16.950
Well, it matches the radiator.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.386
Right, Rich.
It's orange. Color-coordinated.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.021
Matches our hair, too.
It's us.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.724
Come over here.
Look in there.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.715
Oh.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.063
Good size closet.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.465
Uh, that's the bedroom, Ace.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.533
Water heater in the bedroom?

05:34.534 --> 05:36.302
Don't knock it.
It keeps it warm.

05:36.303 --> 05:37.504
- Good point.
- Keeps warm.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.073
- Oh. -And if you want it cool,
follow me.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.075
There's the air conditioner.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.543
On, off.

05:43.543 --> 05:44.644
It didn't move.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.580
It moves when you pay the rent.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.814
Well, at least we got a window.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.450
Oh, yeah. Rich,
it's got everything.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.952
- Fresh air.
- Look, a view.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.220
(cat mewing)

05:53.220 --> 05:56.622
There's nothing in these.
I already checked.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.826
The view talks.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.695
What is this,
another modern convenience?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.730
Hey. hey. guys.
we got a garbage disposal.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.832
All you got to do is
shove the stuff

06:05.832 --> 06:07.067
out the living room window.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.769
L-I just don't know
about this place.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.038
Ah, Rich, I really love it.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.240
It's got that...
that lived-in feeling.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.942
(piano playing upbeat music,
tap dancing)

06:14.942 --> 06:16.310
What's that?

06:16.310 --> 06:18.045
That's the dancing
Drinkwater twins--

06:18.045 --> 06:19.813
Maisy and Daisy.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.281
Fun girls.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.816
(piano playing, tap dancing)

06:22.816 --> 06:24.284
Hear that, Rich?

06:24.284 --> 06:27.454
Maisy and Daisy, right upstairs.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.923
Fun girls.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.558
Any more girls?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.126
Oh, it's all chicks.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.694
Couple of stewardesses
in the back,

06:34.695 --> 06:36.595
three co-eds down the hall.

06:36.596 --> 06:39.132
And in 4H,
there's this cheerleader.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.367
Wah, wah, wah!

06:40.367 --> 06:42.002
We'll take it!

06:42.002 --> 06:43.170
Hey, Potsie, wait.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.371
Got to look around
a little bit.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.604
Ah, come on, Rich!

06:45.605 --> 06:48.341
Oh, look, he said
we had a modern kitchen.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.509
Well, look. You got the sink
over there.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.612
Way over here
on the other side of the room,

06:52.612 --> 06:53.780
we got a refrigerator.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.715
The whole apartmenfs...

06:55.716 --> 06:59.518
And, uh...
opens from both sides.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.921
Look, you guys discuss this
among yourselves.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.155
I'm not pushy.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.419
You got five minutes.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.694
- POTSIE: I love it!
You guys decide. -RICHIE: Guys,

07:08.695 --> 07:11.698
it-it's... it's not that it's,
uh, it's not a nice apartment,

07:11.698 --> 07:15.368
but, you know, somehow,
I just visualize something else.

07:15.369 --> 07:17.571
L-I just pictured
a place that...

07:17.571 --> 07:19.573
that had furniture.

07:19.573 --> 07:23.143
You want furniture?
Go back home.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.778
Hey, the kid's right.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.980
I got a TV there, a couch, sofa.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.181
I got my own bed.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.716
Home? Are you kidding, Rich?

07:29.716 --> 07:31.551
Do you want to hide
your Esquire under your bed

07:31.551 --> 07:33.219
the rest of your life?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.720
No. You're 18.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.157
It's time to cut the cord.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.593
Think of your freedom, Rich.
Independence.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.395
The Drinkwater Twins.

07:41.395 --> 07:42.796
Our own stewardi.

07:42.796 --> 07:47.067
Well, you're right,
but this place is such a...

07:47.067 --> 07:48.969
Why, I mean, you just look
at this place, and it's so...

07:48.969 --> 07:50.936
Okay, Rich, so it's not perfect.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.306
But it'll be ours.
We'll fix it up.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.574
Yeah, we'll fix it.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.643
Rich, I'm having a vision.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.378
I can see it now.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.080
Picture this, Rich.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.815
The place is all cleaned up.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.351
There's pictures, pennants,
new furniture.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.286
Look, Rich,
Pots and I here--

08:06.286 --> 08:08.288
we'll make this a place
Errol Flynn would envy.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.956
Right.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.591
Well, you know,
the price is right.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.759
- Can't be beat.
- It's terrific.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.061
Cheap, cheap.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.730
Okay, I-l think
we can fix it up.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.165
- All right!
- All right, buddy, okay!

08:18.165 --> 08:19.498
We should meet
a stewardess in 4H.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.935
- Oh, great!
- Hey, keep it down.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.704
The cheerleader will be
down here with her pom-poms.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.406
- POTSIE (laughing): Yeah.
- Wah, wah, wah.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.607
Yeah.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.008
Okay, we're gonna
take this place.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.377
Oh, great.
I'll tell my mom.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.912
- Yeah.
- Oh, and one more thing.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.413
I need two months rent,
plus a cleaning deposit.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.283
Comes to 180 bucks.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.918
We only got $60.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.181
You got it.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.590
Well, guys, this is it.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.581
Wah, wah, wah.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.235
Ugh. Well, this is
the last suitcase.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.037
Joanie, did you pack my records?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.305
Yeah, they're in the car.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.606
Even the Elvis?

08:59.606 --> 09:01.141
I'll go get them.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.809
(chuckles)

09:02.809 --> 09:04.811
Got to watch her like a hawk.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.414
Well, I'm gonna take this
out to the car now.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.014
Oh.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.050
- Dad?
- HOWARD: Marion!

09:11.051 --> 09:12.519
Oh, yeah, well...

09:12.519 --> 09:14.510
Thanks.

09:16.756 --> 09:19.525
Well, just seems like yesterday

09:19.526 --> 09:21.517
that we were potty-training him.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.298
Oh, Howard, talk to him.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.268
He's just too young to be
moving away from home.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.103
Well, if you wanted him
to stay home,

09:30.103 --> 09:33.139
you should have never
potty-trained him.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.942
Well, Howard, had I known
at the time, I would...

09:36.943 --> 09:38.611
Oh, good, you're back.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.514
Yeah.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.249
- Well, guess that's it.
- Oh.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.582
I'll be leaving

09:43.583 --> 09:47.387
as soon as Joanie gets down here
with the records.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.222
Now, what are you gonna do
about meals?

09:49.222 --> 09:50.790
And who's gonna do your laundry?

09:50.790 --> 09:51.991
Oh, that's no problem.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.293
Ralph's gonna do the cooking,

09:53.293 --> 09:55.662
and, uh, Potsie's gonna
take care of the laundry.

09:55.662 --> 09:59.065
I'm being replaced
by Ralph and Potsie.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.401
Well, you can still cook
for me, Marion.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.969
Oh, Howard, you'll eat anything.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.700
Thank you, sweetheart.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.775
Well, here are all your records.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.977
Oh. Thanks.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.245
Bye, Rich.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.680
Oh. Bye, Joanie.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.349
Oh, look at your poor sister.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.908
She's gonna miss you.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.587
Are you kidding?

10:20.587 --> 10:22.189
She already moved into my room.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.890
Yeah. The escape tree's
right out the window.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.794
Well, that's coming down
first thing in the morning.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.029
(Richie chuckles)

10:29.029 --> 10:31.231
Well, Richard,
you're a young college man now,

10:31.231 --> 10:32.799
and you've got your own place,

10:32.799 --> 10:34.801
so you're gonna learn
how to behave

10:34.801 --> 10:36.303
like a responsible adult.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.971
It'll be a good experience
for you.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.974
Boy, I hope he has
a better speech when I move out.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.576
Oh.

10:42.576 --> 10:44.743
I'll have it written for you
first thing in the morning.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.512
Come on, Rich.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.981
I'll walk you to the car.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.417
- You lucky dog!
-(Richie chuckles)

10:50.417 --> 10:53.220
Oh, Mom, got to go.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.588
-(Richie laughs)
- Okay.

10:54.588 --> 10:56.188
See you, son.
Enjoy your place.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.691
- Oh, thanks, Dad.
-(car horn toots)

10:57.691 --> 11:01.293
Well, the Two Musketeers
are waiting for me.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.062
I'll see you real soon.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.764
- When?!
- Marion!

11:05.765 --> 11:08.101
Oh, you-you be sure
to write to us!

11:08.101 --> 11:10.203
-(engine revving)
- He's just moving across town.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.194
(car drives off)

11:13.206 --> 11:16.943
Well... it will be
an adjustment,

11:16.943 --> 11:20.947
but it's something that
all parents just have to face.

11:20.947 --> 11:23.716
Yeah. I'm gonna miss him.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.885
We're buddies, you know,
like you and Joanie.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.621
We always talk things over.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.857
We did things together,
went places together.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.259
Oh, Howard.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.029
Who am I gonna
watch TV with, Marion?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.597
It's not gonna be any fun

11:37.597 --> 11:40.600
watching the Green Bay Packers
play all by myself.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.235
Well, I'll watch.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.067
I love basketball.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.314
POtsie?!

11:55.315 --> 11:57.083
(muffled):
I'm brushing my teeth!

11:57.083 --> 11:58.051
What?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.452
I'm brushing my teeth!

11:59.452 --> 12:00.820
I said, I'm brushing my teeth.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.088
RALPH:
Again?

12:02.088 --> 12:03.389
I need help in here.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.693
(whistling)

12:06.693 --> 12:08.889
I'm working over a hot stove,
and he's whistling.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.166
Well, Malph,
how do they look tonight?

12:13.166 --> 12:14.334
(sighs)

12:14.334 --> 12:16.069
Great, Pots, great.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.270
Like a string of pearls

12:17.270 --> 12:18.938
glistening on a sea
of coated tongue.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.406
Thanks.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.708
- You like brushing?
- Yeah.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.710
Brush some pots and pans,
will you?

12:23.710 --> 12:25.478
Again? I just did them
this afternoon.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.347
Well, you're gonna have
to do them over.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.515
I made mashed potatoes.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.684
(Potsie sighs)

12:30.684 --> 12:33.353
Who uses ten pots
to make mashed potatoes anyway?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.688
Why don't you just make instant?

12:34.688 --> 12:36.922
Hmm, good idea. Maybe next time.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.721
Oh, later. I'll just put these
in the oven.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.997
I mashed a lot of potatoes.

12:43.997 --> 12:47.534
Well, at least we won't be
having TV dinners again tonight.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.370
Not this time, Pots.
I'm going all out.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.206
Pot roast, mashies, a vegetable.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.109
And what's wrong
with my TV dinner?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.445
It's frozen on one side
and burnt on the other.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.547
It's like eating
a charcoal Popsicle.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.282
Well, how am I supposed to know
you don't cook them

13:02.282 --> 13:04.284
on top of the stove?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.353
Read the directions.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.946
The directions burned up
in the fire!

13:09.723 --> 13:11.458
That's what you get
for using lighter fluid

13:11.458 --> 13:13.792
on the cherries jubilee.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.796
- Okay. Okay, Warren...
- Yes?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.865
- I'm gonna be honest with you.
- Okay.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.934
I'm sick and tired
of you making fun of my cooking.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.402
You're not perfect, you know.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.903
I saw the laundry.

13:24.904 --> 13:26.672
What's wrong with the laundry?

13:26.673 --> 13:29.342
What-What's wrong
with the laundry?!

13:29.342 --> 13:31.333
What's wrong with the laundry?

13:33.346 --> 13:35.181
Notice anything different?

13:35.181 --> 13:37.216
I knew you'd say something.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.886
Say something?!
How can I not say something?

13:39.886 --> 13:42.446
You gave me a wardrobe
like Peter Pan!

13:48.161 --> 13:50.163
Boy. Boy, are you picky.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.632
Everything we own is green!

13:52.632 --> 13:55.235
Don't you know not to wash
dark clothes with whites?

13:55.235 --> 13:57.437
It'll be easier now.
We don't have any more white.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.772
(shrieks)

13:58.772 --> 14:00.774
Put this stuff away, will you?

14:00.774 --> 14:03.041
Better yet, pile them up
in the corner.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.033
We can tell people it's a bush!

14:06.079 --> 14:08.348
Look, don't tell me what to do.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.016
You dumped them,
you put them back.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.417
- Fine, fine,
- Good.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.630
Was that my shirt?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.299
Well, it wasn't mine
or Richie's.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.168
- Oh.
- Hmm.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.159
(whistling)

14:35.074 --> 14:36.609
How do you like that?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.277
- I loved it.
- Good.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.804
It was your shirt.
(laughing)

14:43.883 --> 14:46.285
Okay. That's it.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.153
I've had it. Put 'em up!

14:50.990 --> 14:53.125
Okay, Pots,
I've been waiting for this

14:53.126 --> 14:54.626
ever since we moved in here.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.762
Now, t-tonight you're gonna be
brushing your gums!

14:56.763 --> 14:58.431
Oh. yeah?

14:58.431 --> 15:00.099
Hey, hey! You guys at it again?

15:00.099 --> 15:02.101
- Now, break it up! -Come on,
Rich. Let me... let me at him!

15:02.101 --> 15:04.036
I want to rip every freckle
out of his face! Come on, Rich!

15:04.037 --> 15:05.972
- Knock it off!
- Let him go! Let him go!

15:05.972 --> 15:07.273
Hey, will you cool it?

15:07.273 --> 15:09.776
Man.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.245
We went through a lot
to get this place.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.914
We had to argue with our parents
to get their permission.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.313
I didn't.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.186
Yeah, but... but, look,
we all wanted

15:20.186 --> 15:21.954
to move in here together, right?

15:21.955 --> 15:24.224
N-Now, we all got
our little personality quirks

15:24.224 --> 15:25.724
that are gonna bug us.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.595
So we're gonna have to just try
and live with those things.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.532
We got a problem, we got
to just talk it out, okay?

15:32.532 --> 15:34.801
(chuckles)
Oh, come on.

15:34.801 --> 15:38.471
We're best friends.
Ralph, Potsie and Richie.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.874
The Three Musketeers.
Peas in a pod!

15:41.875 --> 15:45.607
We're more like peas than you
know; get a load of the laundry.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.316
Green?

15:51.317 --> 15:53.119
Green laundry?

15:53.119 --> 15:55.788
Potsie!

15:55.788 --> 15:57.356
Green is nice.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.691
- I like it.
- What do you mean you like it?

15:59.692 --> 16:02.628
No, no. Now, look,
I-l realize that, uh,

16:02.629 --> 16:06.231
all of our-our laundry
is green--

16:06.232 --> 16:08.901
<i>I</i> never wear green--

16:08.902 --> 16:10.769
but-but that's all right.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.272
That's all right.

16:12.272 --> 16:15.375
We've got to just...
talk it out.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.777
All right. All right.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.579
We'll talk.

16:19.579 --> 16:23.850
Potsie, now, you know we've been
friends for a long time,

16:23.850 --> 16:27.921
so I know you won't take this...
criticism as anything personal.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.056
Well, not when
you approach criticism

16:30.056 --> 16:31.558
on an adult level like that.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.026
What is it?

16:33.026 --> 16:36.361
You brushing your teeth all
the time, Pots, I can't take it!

16:36.362 --> 16:38.531
Day and night! Up and down!

16:38.531 --> 16:40.266
It's like living
with the tooth fairy!

16:40.266 --> 16:43.603
You just wish you had checkups
like mine!

16:43.603 --> 16:45.405
Oh, yeah?
Your teeth are crooked!

16:45.405 --> 16:46.539
Bite your tongue!

16:46.539 --> 16:49.406
Hey, hey! Peas! Peas in a pod!

16:56.449 --> 16:59.043
So, what's for dinner tonight?

17:04.022 --> 17:07.026
Guys, do I set a table?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.895
Okay, boys, dig in.

17:08.895 --> 17:12.497
(piano playing upbeat music,
tap dancing)

17:12.498 --> 17:15.534
Hey, this is great.
We even get a floor show.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.204
Green sauerkraut?

17:18.204 --> 17:20.740
What happened? Did it get
mixed up with the laundry?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.075
Funny, Rich.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.210
No, the cookbook said to serve
a cheery-looking meal.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.479
Sauerkraut is dull.
I added vegetable dye.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.914
Will it stain my teeth?

17:27.914 --> 17:30.083
- I don't care about your teeth!
- Hey, hey, hey, Ralph.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.385
Ralph, take it easy, okay?

17:32.385 --> 17:33.620
Just take it easy.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.922
I'm... I'm gonna
slice the meat now.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.191
That's-that's not the meat.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.387
That's the gravy.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.430
You got to slice the gravy?

17:45.431 --> 17:47.767
Petrified gravy.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.703
Ralph, get a grip. Get a grip.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.371
Now-now, can we eat?

17:52.372 --> 17:54.040
All right.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.776
L-I think I'm gonna pass
on the, uh...

17:56.776 --> 17:58.111
the sliced gravy.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.779
AW, Why?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.714
Because we hate your cooking,
Malph.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.783
You even make gravy
that stands up.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.418
That did it, Pots.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.320
You want to cook?
Here, you cook!

18:07.320 --> 18:08.920
- Anything's better than you,
Malph! -Yeah, right...

18:08.921 --> 18:10.489
Anything in the world
is better than you, Malph!

18:10.490 --> 18:12.481
- Let me tell you.
- Will you guys knock it off?!

18:17.697 --> 18:19.766
Oh, hi, Fonz, Al.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.633
You seen Potsie around anywhere?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.706
I know. I know, I know.
Don't say it.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.642
I heard all the green jokes
on the way over here.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.634
Did anybody say,
"Hey, a redheaded frog"?

18:34.947 --> 18:39.009
How about, "Does your outfit
change color when you get ripe?"

18:40.053 --> 18:41.888
- Uh, no.
- You see that?

18:41.888 --> 18:45.158
You haven't heard them all.
Don't get cocky with us.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.794
All right, now,
what are you so frazzled about?

18:47.794 --> 18:49.796
- Oh, it... it's nothing.
- Here, here. Come on. Sit down.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.596
Here. Let me take this back.

18:51.597 --> 18:55.090
Maybe the meat fell out
in the kitchen.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.705
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.177
Cunningham, that was not
one of your more positive

19:04.177 --> 19:06.244
"ha, ha, ha, ha"s.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.414
It's the pad.

19:08.414 --> 19:11.083
It's-it's just not working out.

19:11.084 --> 19:13.151
Look at me.
I'm not getting any sleep.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.154
Like, last night,
the Drinkwater twins,

19:15.154 --> 19:16.589
they kept me awake
half the night.

19:16.589 --> 19:20.389
The Drinkwater twins.
lam proud of you, Red!

19:21.427 --> 19:22.695
Oh...

19:22.695 --> 19:24.030
Now-now, wait a minute.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.432
I mean, now I understand
why you look so terrible,

19:26.432 --> 19:29.502
but what a way to go!

19:29.502 --> 19:33.234
No, Fonz, see, uh,
they were dancing over my head.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.678
You're getting
very strange, Rich.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.314
No, it's-it's not the twins.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.516
It's... it's Ralph and Potsie.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.218
-(chuckles)
- They're driving me crazy.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.953
They're like
The Katzenjammer <i>Kids.</i>

19:46.953 --> 19:49.088
Arguing, they are
always arguing.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.190
And Ralph-- he cooks, right?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.659
I got to use his gravy
as a paperweight.

19:53.659 --> 19:56.662
And Potsie-- he's the worst.
He sings himself to sleep.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.397
Do you know
how many stanzas there are

19:58.397 --> 19:59.932
to "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"?

19:59.932 --> 20:01.867
And he sings both parts!

20:01.868 --> 20:04.604
Now, the mornings,
the mornings are incredible.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.405
Ralph cooks the corn flakes.

20:07.406 --> 20:10.109
Potsie-- he spends an hour
in the bathroom.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.612
What's he do in there,
brush his teeth one at a time?

20:12.612 --> 20:13.613
(chuckles)

20:13.613 --> 20:15.782
Yes, one at a time!

20:15.782 --> 20:17.115
Front and back.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.185
I... l-l don't know, Fonz.

20:19.185 --> 20:23.456
I just... thought it was
gonna be different somehow.

20:23.456 --> 20:24.757
(sighs)

20:24.757 --> 20:26.492
It-It's probably me.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.160
Hey. Get over here.

20:28.161 --> 20:30.028
Don't you dare blame yourself.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.497
People are different.

20:31.497 --> 20:34.033
You could be best of friends
and you can't live together.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.268
Hey, you really think so?

20:35.268 --> 20:36.469
I know so.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.138
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna have to move.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.540
How do you think
I ought to tell them?

20:41.541 --> 20:42.874
You know,
they're my best friends,

20:42.875 --> 20:45.077
and-and I don't want
to hurt their feelings.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.812
Well, Rich, you're not
a bunch of kids anymore.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.014
You're adults, right?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.482
There's no need to make up
little stories,

20:49.482 --> 20:51.818
no need to
just beat around the bush.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.920
You got to tell them
straight out, dig it?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.755
Straight out.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.524
Yeah. I suppose I could.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.659
Yeah. Listen, I'm gonna go
and pick up my truck,

21:00.660 --> 21:03.596
-bring it around, help you move,
all right? -Oh, thanks, Fonz.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.932
You know, you're right
about that.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.924
I can just tell them
straight out. I-I'm an adult.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.872
An adult dressed
like a bell pepper.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.407
Now, you see that?

21:14.407 --> 21:17.543
Now, there's one I bet nobody
ever heard of, bell pepper.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.409
Get out of here.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.116
RALPH: Wh-Why should your name
be the first one on the mailbox?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.185
POTSIE: 'Cause I wanted
the apartment first.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.553
No, I should go first.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.088
Alphabetically,
"Malph" comes before "Weber."

21:29.088 --> 21:31.691
Yeah, but "Potsie"
comes before "Ralph."

21:31.691 --> 21:33.226
Will you guys can it?

21:33.226 --> 21:35.126
You should see
where we put your name.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.563
I don't care. I-l got something
important to tell you.

21:37.563 --> 21:38.631
Shoot, Rich.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.834
Well, I'm, uh...

21:41.834 --> 21:44.470
gonna be moving out today.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.472
- Is it Ralph?
- Me?!

21:46.472 --> 21:48.841
It's probably you with your
teeth-brushing, right, Rich?

21:48.841 --> 21:50.376
No, no, it wasn't Potsie.

21:50.376 --> 21:52.111
And it wasn't you, Ralph.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.480
It was the two of you together.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.550
I mean, the way you argue.
It's just...

21:57.550 --> 22:00.286
Well, it reminds me of the way
Joanie and I

22:00.286 --> 22:01.879
used to go at each other...

22:03.823 --> 22:05.156
Well, it...

22:05.157 --> 22:08.627
And it-it made me, uh...
homesick.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.595
That's it.
I'm just... I'm homesick.

22:10.596 --> 22:11.931
No kidding?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.566
Gosh, we're gonna miss you.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.534
Yeah, I'm gonna miss
you guys, too.

22:16.535 --> 22:18.537
Well, maybe in a year or so,

22:18.537 --> 22:20.506
-you'll be adult enough
to come back. -Yeah.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.975
- Adult enough?
- RALPH: Yeah.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.611
Hopefully.

22:25.611 --> 22:28.013
Uh, I-l just hope
I'm not leaving you in a bind.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.081
- Oh. No, that's all right, Rich.
- Good.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.685
- Hey, Pots, we're gonna have
to pay more rent now. -Hmm?

22:32.685 --> 22:34.353
Aw, that's okay.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.623
My dad will pay anything
to keep me out of the house.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.792
How 'bout that, Pots?

22:39.792 --> 22:41.594
Just the two of us now.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.530
Yeah. Two Musketeers.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.132
Ralph and Potsie.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.667
Right. pal!

22:47.667 --> 22:49.669
Come on, buddy. Let's go up
and see the Drinkwater twins.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.804
Okay. I love that Maisy.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.739
No. N-No, Maisy's mine.
You got Daisy.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.741
Wait a minute,
Maisy's better looking.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.876
What do you mean?
They're identical twins.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.477
She's got better teeth.

22:59.478 --> 23:00.707
Better teeth.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.122
I was gonna knock, but I didn't
think the door could handle it.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.223
Hi, Fonz.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.459
So, did you tell them?

23:13.459 --> 23:14.827
Oh, Y-Yeah, yeah.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.829
Well, sure.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.265
Kind of hard growing up,
ain't it?

23:19.265 --> 23:22.835
Well, yeah.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.503
I lied.

23:24.503 --> 23:27.306
I didn't want to hurt
their feelings, so I, uh...

23:27.306 --> 23:28.908
told them I was homesick.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.775
Now, wait a minute, Red.
That ain't lying.

23:30.776 --> 23:32.311
You didn't lie.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.713
Seems to me what you were being
there was, uh,

23:34.714 --> 23:37.717
very, uh, United Nations,
you know?

23:37.717 --> 23:39.118
Very diplomatic.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.420
You wanted to save
your friends' feelings, man.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.088
That's cool. That ain't lying.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.657
Yeah, now let's get out of here.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.257
We could grab your bags.
Where's your furniture?

23:46.258 --> 23:49.250
Oh, well, this is all I got
right here.

23:52.765 --> 23:56.168
This is very cute, Rich,
very cute.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.304
But little red elephants
do not ride in the Fonz's truck.

23:59.305 --> 24:00.638
Oh.

24:00.639 --> 24:03.709
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll just,
uh, leave this here.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.945
- Ralph likes it anyway.
- Yeah.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.812
All right, give me this.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.804
Oh. Thanks.

24:11.417 --> 24:12.785
I'll tell you something.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.421
I'm... I'm gonna miss
this place.

24:15.421 --> 24:17.556
Had a lot of good times here.

24:17.556 --> 24:20.893
Name one.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.462
Hey, you're right.
Let's beat it.
