Got to read,
got to read, got to read,

00:20.236 --> 00:21.570
got to read, got to read,
got to read,

00:21.571 --> 00:22.871
got to read, got to read.

00:22.872 --> 00:24.807
Wow, I feel
the exact opposite way.

00:24.808 --> 00:26.007
Why are you saying that?

00:26.042 --> 00:27.810
Book report.
I wrote the due date

00:27.811 --> 00:29.678
on my arm so I would remember,
then every day since then,

00:29.679 --> 00:30.845
I've taken a shower
like an idiot.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.113
When's it due?
Tomorrow.

00:32.148 --> 00:33.514
Ah!
What page are you on?

00:33.550 --> 00:34.949
The cover.
(screaming)

00:34.984 --> 00:36.852
<i>Call of the Wild?</i>

00:36.853 --> 00:38.721
Is it about
an insane telemarketer?

00:38.722 --> 00:40.722
Or Gene in the bathroom?
I don't know yet.

00:40.757 --> 00:42.157
Hey, kids.

00:42.158 --> 00:43.826
Oh, Bob, this package
came for you earlier

00:43.827 --> 00:45.059
when you were putting
out that grease fire.

00:45.095 --> 00:46.729
See, that's why I hate school.

00:46.730 --> 00:48.296
We miss all the grease fires.

00:48.331 --> 00:49.765
Huh, I wasn't
expecting anything.

00:49.766 --> 00:51.200
Oh. Oh, yeah.

00:51.201 --> 00:53.167
(chuckles)
I-I remember ordering this.

00:53.203 --> 00:54.703
What the hell is that?

00:54.704 --> 00:56.271
I bought a remote
control version

00:56.272 --> 00:58.506
of the helicopter from
the movie <i> True Lies,</i>

00:58.541 --> 01:00.342
complete with a
clutching Arnold Schwarzenegger

01:00.343 --> 01:02.677
and dangling Jamie Lee Curtis.

01:02.712 --> 01:03.912
Hmm. Oh. Hmm.

01:03.913 --> 01:05.046
Huh.
What a beaut.

01:05.081 --> 01:06.882
Were you drunk shopping?
No.

01:06.883 --> 01:08.717
I call it "nighttime shopping,

01:08.718 --> 01:10.119
with wine."

01:10.120 --> 01:12.653
I bid on an auction
and, uh, yeah, helicopter.

01:12.689 --> 01:14.256
Mm-hmm.

01:14.257 --> 01:16.691
Fly, you bastard, fly!

01:16.726 --> 01:18.226
Hold on, Jamie Lee, I gotcha.

01:18.261 --> 01:20.596
I'll save you from Tia Carrera,
I think.

01:20.597 --> 01:21.864
I forget the scene.

01:21.865 --> 01:23.265
Hey, when does Mama get a turn?

01:23.266 --> 01:24.366
I want to save Jamie Lee.

01:24.367 --> 01:25.701
Lin, I just started.

01:25.702 --> 01:27.069
And I think
I'm really good at this.

01:27.070 --> 01:28.771
This could be,
like, my new thing.

01:28.772 --> 01:30.938
Dad, you don't want to be,
like, too cool.

01:32.308 --> 01:33.442
Hello, boots.

01:33.443 --> 01:34.876
Hanging like you do every day.

01:34.911 --> 01:36.311
Give it.
Geez, Lin.

01:36.312 --> 01:37.912
All right, let me just
bring it in for a landing.

01:39.883 --> 01:41.917
You can't pull off
that look, buddy.

01:41.918 --> 01:43.051
It's not you.

01:43.052 --> 01:45.386
Gentle, gentle, and...

01:45.422 --> 01:47.756
kiss the ground.

01:47.757 --> 01:49.091
(all groan) What the hell?

01:49.092 --> 01:51.058
How did that happen?
I landed it perfectly.

01:51.094 --> 01:53.161
(squeaking)

01:54.097 --> 01:55.963
(humming)

01:55.999 --> 01:58.099
T-T-Ti...

01:58.134 --> 01:59.902
Well, it had a good run. Of one.

01:59.903 --> 02:02.537
That thing is a piece of crap.
I'm getting my money back.

02:02.572 --> 02:04.071
T-Ti-Tina...

02:04.107 --> 02:05.174
Well, maybe it's okay. See?

02:05.175 --> 02:06.607
Oh, no, it's dead.

02:06.643 --> 02:09.043
Squi-Squi-Squirrel.
♪ I'm reading ♪

02:09.078 --> 02:11.513
♪ I'm reading ♪
BOB: Oh, Tina. Tina! Tina!

02:11.514 --> 02:13.015
(grunts) Ah. Thanks, Dad.

02:13.016 --> 02:15.017
I hate getting hit
on the head by boots.

02:15.018 --> 02:17.453
Uh, you're welcome, Tina.
Should we throw them back up?

02:17.454 --> 02:18.653
I kind of feel bad.

02:18.688 --> 02:20.221
They've been there for so long.

02:20.256 --> 02:22.690
(grunts) Look out, Tina!

02:24.494 --> 02:26.161
I just... froze.

02:26.162 --> 02:28.129
"And following
a skillful landing,

02:28.164 --> 02:29.998
"it broke into a million pieces.

02:29.999 --> 02:34.269
Please issue me a full refund
of $45 plus shipping."

02:34.270 --> 02:37.005
And send.
That thing was 45 bucks?

02:37.006 --> 02:38.373
Plus shipping.
Which was...

02:38.374 --> 02:40.174
also 45 bucks.
The hell?

02:40.210 --> 02:41.643
Ugh! What's wrong with me?

02:41.644 --> 02:43.312
I just watched everything
happen!

02:43.313 --> 02:46.147
The squirrel, the boots!
And I did nothing!

02:46.182 --> 02:48.116
(altering voice): Hey,
let's all be quiet so Tina can read.

02:48.117 --> 02:49.885
(normally): Who said that?
Face it.

02:49.886 --> 02:52.387
I'm not heroic like Arnold
Schwarzenegger in <i> True Lies!</i>

02:52.388 --> 02:54.723
I'm not even Tom
Arnold in <i> True Lies!</i>

02:54.724 --> 02:56.457
Or even in <i> Roseanne!</i>

02:56.493 --> 02:57.793
Come on, Gene.
Don't worry about it.

02:57.794 --> 02:59.361
That was just part
of being a dad.

02:59.362 --> 03:01.029
You'll have those
instincts someday.

03:01.030 --> 03:02.965
But what if I never
get those instincts?

03:02.966 --> 03:06.267
Maybe I'll just grow up to
be a very handsome coward!

03:06.302 --> 03:08.036
Dad, you saved Tina!

03:08.037 --> 03:10.806
You're a heroic man of action.
I can learn from you.

03:10.807 --> 03:13.141
Gene, I-I think you're blowing
this out of proportion.

03:13.142 --> 03:16.143
Though I did react with
a certain amount of grace

03:16.179 --> 03:18.013
under pressure.
What the hell?! (computer chimes)

03:18.014 --> 03:20.082
"Sorry, I don't give refunds
for crash landings"?!

03:20.083 --> 03:22.518
"Heliflopter"?!
All right, new plan.

03:22.519 --> 03:25.319
His number's on the Web site.
I'm calling this guy.

03:25.355 --> 03:27.356
He's doing it!
He's man-of-actioning.

03:27.357 --> 03:29.624
Which I call "mactioning."

03:29.659 --> 03:31.727
Hello? Is this Sheldon Felds?
This is Bob.

03:31.728 --> 03:33.562
GENE: That's it, Dad.
Give it to him.

03:33.563 --> 03:36.832
No, not Bob the crash-lander.
It kissed the ground, Sheldon.

03:36.833 --> 03:38.834
Kissed it. Maybe I should've
just bought it

03:38.835 --> 03:41.036
from The Hobby Hole.
A <i> real</i> store.

03:41.037 --> 03:42.403
Hobby Hole!

03:42.438 --> 03:43.772
Well, how about I just
come on down

03:43.773 --> 03:45.673
and demand my money back? Yeah,

03:45.708 --> 03:47.209
your address is
right on the package.

03:47.210 --> 03:48.710
So see you soon, Sheldon!

03:48.711 --> 03:51.547
Oh, and, also,
your handwriting is...

03:51.548 --> 03:54.215
not very good!
Nice one, Dad.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.618
Bob, don't you think maybe
you should just let this go?

03:56.619 --> 03:58.754
You know how you get.
You start saying

03:58.755 --> 04:00.389
"It's the principle" over and over.
It's the principle of it, Lin,

04:00.390 --> 04:01.890
the principle.
Yep, there it is.

04:01.891 --> 04:03.358
Wait, how did you know
I was gonna say that?

04:03.359 --> 04:05.561
I've never said that.
Right. Yeah. Right.

04:05.562 --> 04:07.662
It's the principle
of the thing, sir.

04:07.697 --> 04:08.663
It's the principle!

04:08.698 --> 04:10.031
Prin... ci... ple!

04:10.066 --> 04:11.733
Oh, well, it <i> is</i> the principle.

04:11.734 --> 04:13.901
And someone's got to stand
up for what's right!

04:13.937 --> 04:15.704
Things are pretty loud,
so I'm just gonna put

04:15.705 --> 04:17.906
my fingers in my ears.
Whoa, that's waxy!

04:17.906 --> 04:19.141
Am I shouting?!

04:19.142 --> 04:20.541
I'm going over there.
(sighs)

04:20.543 --> 04:22.077
I'm going, too!
No, you're not, Gene.

04:22.077 --> 04:23.078
It's a school night.

04:23.079 --> 04:24.913
This is my school now, Mom,

04:24.914 --> 04:26.582
the School of Hard Dads!

04:26.583 --> 04:28.817
So just call me Li'l Hard Dad!
Yeah!

04:28.818 --> 04:31.320
But, no, not that.
But, yes, he should come!

04:31.321 --> 04:33.322
If Gene wants to learn
to be a man of action,

04:33.323 --> 04:34.789
this is taking action!

04:34.824 --> 04:36.290
Okay.
Bye.

04:36.326 --> 04:38.160
Come on, Gene.
Let's go get our refund!

04:38.161 --> 04:39.661
Refund road trip!

04:39.662 --> 04:41.563
I forgot my keys!

04:41.564 --> 04:43.565
Yeah, he did!
Deal with it!

04:43.566 --> 04:45.900
Deal with it!
Yeah!

04:47.832 --> 04:51.635
Look at us, just a boy and his
dad, driving to get a refund.

04:51.636 --> 04:54.038
Ooh, I got chills just saying it.
Well, Gene, it's...

04:54.039 --> 04:55.806
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Don't talk yet.

04:55.807 --> 04:58.542
I want to sample what you say
and play it over and over

04:58.543 --> 05:00.311
until I've got heroic instincts

05:00.312 --> 05:02.546
coming out of every orifice
of my body.

05:02.547 --> 05:05.382
Okay. Uh, it's not about being
a hero, Gene.

05:05.383 --> 05:07.150
It's about doing what's right.

05:07.185 --> 05:08.418
Papa, do preach!

05:08.453 --> 05:09.687
And it is our duty,

05:09.688 --> 05:11.121
to mankind, really,

05:11.122 --> 05:12.723
to fight for justice.

05:12.724 --> 05:14.892
Some people say you have
to learn to let things go.

05:14.893 --> 05:16.994
Well, you know what happens
when you let things go?

05:16.995 --> 05:18.662
What?! What happens?!

05:18.663 --> 05:20.497
You drop the thing
you're holding, Gene.

05:20.498 --> 05:22.499
And the thing I'm holding
in this situation

05:22.500 --> 05:25.169
is this bag of crap.
Nice! Listen to this.

05:25.170 --> 05:26.737
It's about doing what's right.

05:26.738 --> 05:29.006
(fart sound effect)
Wow, I sound important.

05:29.007 --> 05:31.441
Powerful.
Maybe take out the fart noise?

05:31.476 --> 05:33.510
No. It kind of makes you go,
like, "Huh, good point"

05:33.511 --> 05:35.411
<i>and also, "Good fart."</i>

05:36.848 --> 05:38.682
Mom, Mom, look what I drew.

05:38.683 --> 05:40.084
It's me when I'm grown up,

05:40.085 --> 05:41.752
eating tacos
with my monkey Sheila.

05:41.753 --> 05:43.254
Great, honey.
Yeah.

05:43.255 --> 05:45.189
How's the reading coming, Tina?
Oh, good.

05:45.190 --> 05:47.123
Really, really,
really good. Good.

05:47.158 --> 05:49.159
Okay, fine! It's going terrible!
I'm a slow reader!

05:49.160 --> 05:50.828
And then I get to a comma
and I'm like, "Oh, I guess

05:50.829 --> 05:52.696
"they want me to pause,
but for how long? How do I know

05:52.697 --> 05:54.831
when to stop pausing?!" I'm
never gonna finish this book!

05:54.866 --> 05:57.034
Ah! And I'm gonna have to stand
up there with the whole class

05:57.035 --> 05:59.002
staring at me and my armpits are gonna
sweat and my boobs are gonna sweat

05:59.037 --> 06:00.738
and all the sweat's gonna meet
in the middle

06:00.739 --> 06:02.239
and everyone's gonna know
I didn't read the book!

06:02.240 --> 06:04.508
(grunts) Thank you.
Tina, Tina, honey, listen.

06:04.509 --> 06:07.177
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, mm-kay?

06:07.178 --> 06:10.247
I didn't read any of the books
I did reports on in school. What?

06:10.248 --> 06:11.915
Oh, yeah,
I've never read the book.

06:11.916 --> 06:13.550
Louise! What?
You never read the book.

06:13.551 --> 06:15.452
Well, I mean, you should
read the book.

06:15.453 --> 06:18.321
It's-it's better to read the
book. We never read the book.

06:18.356 --> 06:20.423
How can you do a book report
if you haven't read the book?

06:20.458 --> 06:22.459
You just got to give 'em
a little show. Pizzazz 'em

06:22.460 --> 06:24.595
so they don't even notice
that you didn't you-know-what.

06:24.596 --> 06:26.262
Pizzazz, that's up my alley.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.465
I once did a presentation
on <i> Catcher in the Rye</i>

06:28.466 --> 06:30.801
with only a catcher's mask
and a loaf of rye bread.

06:30.802 --> 06:32.935
Now, that one I failed, 'cause
I didn't back-cover it.

06:32.971 --> 06:35.406
Back-cover it? Oh, my God,
Mom, Let me slap her again.

06:35.407 --> 06:37.574
No, it's okay.
Don't slap her again.

06:37.575 --> 06:40.577
Tina's learning. See, Tina, you
can't judge a book by its cover,

06:40.578 --> 06:43.747
but you <i> can</i> judge it by
its back cover. Mm-hmm.

06:43.748 --> 06:45.515
Uh-huh... Wait, I don't get it.

06:45.550 --> 06:46.884
All right, let me see.
Let me see here.

06:46.885 --> 06:49.018
Dog named Buck, stolen
from his home,

06:49.054 --> 06:50.454
forced to live as a sled dog

06:50.455 --> 06:52.289
in the cold,
unforgiving Klondike region.

06:52.290 --> 06:54.124
Oh, my gosh, I'm getting
so many ideas already!

06:54.125 --> 06:56.560
Musical numbers, choreography...
Musical numbers?

06:56.561 --> 06:58.462
Louise, you're on props
and costumes!

06:58.463 --> 07:00.064
I'm on lyrics and dance steps!

07:00.065 --> 07:01.998
Tina, go wash your face!
We got a show to do!

07:03.401 --> 07:05.469
S. Felds. This is it.

07:05.470 --> 07:07.471
Let's give him hell!
(over intercom): Hello?

07:07.472 --> 07:09.306
Sheldon? It's Bob.
Go away.

07:09.307 --> 07:10.941
Okay, bye.
No, Gene, come back.

07:10.942 --> 07:12.742
Right, right.
Li'l Hard Dad.

07:12.777 --> 07:15.279
We're not leaving, Sheldon.
Not until we get our money back

07:15.280 --> 07:17.114
for this defective helicopter!

07:17.115 --> 07:19.482
So do the right thing
and give us a refund.

07:19.517 --> 07:22.186
Well put. Yep.
You don't get it, do you, Bob?

07:22.187 --> 07:24.788
Sheldon Felds doesn't give
refunds to heliflopters

07:24.789 --> 07:26.923
who crash on their first flight.

07:26.958 --> 07:28.792
Stop calling me a heliflopter!

07:28.793 --> 07:30.960
We don't care how
fun it is to say!

07:30.995 --> 07:33.997
You see, I only sell those
novelty toys to make ends meet.

07:33.998 --> 07:37.967
My real passion is customizing
serious RC choppers.

07:38.002 --> 07:38.969
Well, what is that?

07:38.970 --> 07:40.104
This is my quad.

07:40.105 --> 07:41.338
I've made a few modifications

07:41.339 --> 07:43.607
for... poking purposes.

07:43.608 --> 07:45.309
(scoffs) That's dumb. Poke!

07:45.310 --> 07:46.776
Hey! Ah! Tickle, tickle.

07:46.811 --> 07:49.612
Tap, tap.
Missed me! Stop-stop that. Ah! Ah!

07:49.647 --> 07:51.382
Hey, there's something
on your shirt. What?

07:51.383 --> 07:53.149
Oop, got your nose! Quit it! Ah!

07:53.184 --> 07:55.786
So, shall I continue
to masterfully poke you,

07:55.787 --> 07:57.520
or do you want
to run along home?

07:57.555 --> 07:59.323
The latter!
Good day, sir!

07:59.324 --> 08:02.024
No, we're not going anywhere.
Okay then!

08:02.060 --> 08:03.326
Suit yourself, Bob!

08:03.361 --> 08:04.628
Wet Willy!
Ah!

08:04.629 --> 08:05.862
How is that wet?!

08:05.897 --> 08:07.463
LINDA: <i>Oh, she looks great.</i>

08:07.499 --> 08:09.632
You look great, hon.
Maybe the best she's ever looked.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.068
Give us a twirl.
See that tail?

08:11.069 --> 08:12.535
Real construction paper.

08:12.570 --> 08:13.670
Stunning.
Thank you.

08:13.671 --> 08:14.972
Wag it a little honey, will you?

08:14.973 --> 08:15.973
(grunting) Wag it, wag it.

08:15.974 --> 08:17.174
Shake it, shake it.

08:17.175 --> 08:18.841
That a girl.
All right,

08:18.877 --> 08:21.879
so let the <i> Call of the Wild</i>
book report rehearsal begin!

08:21.880 --> 08:23.547
Tina, here's the lyrics
for the opening number.

08:23.548 --> 08:25.214
Go ahead and sing it!
Go on, girl.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.084
Okay. Ring, ring.

08:27.085 --> 08:29.086
(weakly):
♪ Who's this calling on the phone? ♪

08:29.087 --> 08:31.721
♪ It's the Wild,
is anybody home? ♪

08:31.756 --> 08:34.424
Great lyrics, Mom. I know.
But you got to belt it, honey.

08:34.426 --> 08:37.027
Let your voice do the reading
that your eyes didn't do.

08:37.028 --> 08:40.230
That makes total sense. Uh-huh.
So can you do it with vibrato?

08:40.231 --> 08:43.100
Like this?
♪ Wild, wild! ♪

08:43.101 --> 08:45.535
(flat): ♪ Wild... ♪

08:45.570 --> 08:47.237
No, that's n... Okay.
You know what, try grabbing

08:47.238 --> 08:48.872
the skin on your throat
and moving it around

08:48.873 --> 08:50.541
while you sing like this.
♪ Na... ♪

08:50.542 --> 08:52.509
Like this? ♪ Uh... ♪ No.

08:52.510 --> 08:54.211
Let me try, let me try.
(vibrating sounds) (coughing)

08:54.212 --> 08:58.247
Gentle! Gentle!
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

08:58.283 --> 09:00.516
(groans) Maybe I should just
transfer to St. Mathews.

09:00.552 --> 09:02.953
What? You think those nuns
won't make you do book reports?

09:02.954 --> 09:05.122
People never stop making
you read books, Tina.

09:05.123 --> 09:08.725
It's a sick world! You got to learn
how to faux-dazzle it. Trust me.

09:08.726 --> 09:12.328
After tonight, you won't ever have to
read a book again. I love you, Mom.

09:12.363 --> 09:14.765
BOB: So, Gene,
I know it seems like we're hiding

09:14.766 --> 09:17.067
from Sheldon's helicopter
in a Dumpster...

09:17.068 --> 09:19.100
GENE: Very much so.
...but we're actually

09:19.103 --> 09:23.439
just r-regrouping. And now I
will calmly check outside...

09:24.476 --> 09:26.043
Oh, thank God. It's gone.

09:26.044 --> 09:28.045
I mean, regroup over.
Uh, we can get out now.

09:28.046 --> 09:30.547
We don't have to get out on
my account. I'm in my element.

09:30.548 --> 09:33.349
No, we are going to show
Sheldon that we're still here

09:33.384 --> 09:36.086
and we'll never give up!
Whoa. Whoa. What's that?

09:36.087 --> 09:38.688
Fish in the sky!
This was in Revelations!

09:38.723 --> 09:40.089
Kirk Cameron was right!

09:40.124 --> 09:42.358
You done hiding, Bob?!

09:42.393 --> 09:45.229
We're not hiding, Sheldon!
We were regrouping!

09:45.230 --> 09:46.863
And we still want our refund!

09:46.898 --> 09:49.098
Uh-huh. Swim, my pets. Swim!

09:49.133 --> 09:52.134
(chuckles) Your gently floating
fish don't scare me, Sheldon!

09:52.170 --> 09:55.005
They're actually kind of pretty!
It's a lot like snorkeling,

09:55.006 --> 09:58.108
which I've never done,
but I imagine I would love it!

09:58.109 --> 09:59.375
Ow. Ow.

09:59.410 --> 10:00.543
Dad!

10:00.578 --> 10:01.845
You're shooting BBs at me!

10:01.846 --> 10:03.514
Ow! That one hit me
in the nipple!

10:03.515 --> 10:06.716
That's his good nipple!
My good nipple is bleeding!

10:06.751 --> 10:10.119
Are we done here, Bob?!
You lose, I win! Also,

10:10.154 --> 10:12.155
I have a couple frozen
pizzas in the oven,

10:12.156 --> 10:13.623
so I'm ready to wrap this up.

10:13.658 --> 10:15.659
No! We're not done!
We're not?

10:15.660 --> 10:17.761
No! Two can play the game

10:17.762 --> 10:19.997
of having a helicopter
that shoots stuff, Gene!

10:19.998 --> 10:22.499
Two can play!
Wow, you sound really tough,

10:22.500 --> 10:23.934
even though you're holding
your nipples.

10:23.935 --> 10:26.036
This is war, Sheldon!

10:26.037 --> 10:27.904
MAN: <i>Welcome to The Hobby Hole.</i>

10:27.939 --> 10:29.505
I'm Terry, how can I help you?

10:29.541 --> 10:30.974
Hi, uh, weird question.

10:30.975 --> 10:33.176
Do you by any chance
have any RC helicopters

10:33.177 --> 10:34.977
capable of actual warfare?

10:35.013 --> 10:37.447
Uh, we don't have
anything like that, sir.

10:37.448 --> 10:39.149
(whispering): Follow me.

10:39.150 --> 10:42.952
Welcome to the world
of RC helicopter warfare.

10:42.987 --> 10:45.937
BOTH: Whoa.
I was hoping that would get a "whoa."

10:47.006 --> 10:50.008
We have to be pretty discreet
about our warfare showroom,

10:50.009 --> 10:51.843
as you can imagine,
but neat-o, huh?

10:51.844 --> 10:53.044
"Sky-sassin"?

10:53.045 --> 10:54.245
That sounds brutal.

10:54.246 --> 10:55.980
War is brutal.

10:55.981 --> 10:57.415
Of course,
we advise you absolutely...

10:57.416 --> 10:58.883
do not aim these at people.

10:58.884 --> 11:00.818
Unless you hate them.
Oh.

11:00.819 --> 11:03.854
Now, I need to know what kind of
element we're dealing with here.

11:03.889 --> 11:05.890
Well, it's this guy who sold
me a helicopter online,

11:05.891 --> 11:07.057
Sheldon Felds...

11:07.092 --> 11:08.358
Oh.
What?

11:08.394 --> 11:09.893
Oh, man.
What is it, Terry?

11:09.928 --> 11:11.362
Just stay away
from Sheldon Felds.

11:11.363 --> 11:12.397
Wait, you know him?

11:12.398 --> 11:13.531
He used to work here.

11:13.532 --> 11:14.898
He was fired.
Why?

11:14.933 --> 11:16.934
Let's just say Sheldon ate
a lot of food

11:16.935 --> 11:19.771
out of the fridge in the break
room that didn't belong to him

11:19.772 --> 11:21.406
and was clearly labeled.

11:21.407 --> 11:23.841
And when me and the rest
of the Hobby Hole guys decided

11:23.842 --> 11:26.643
to gently approach him about it,
he attacked us with helicopters.

11:26.678 --> 11:27.711
Hmm.
You see this?

11:27.746 --> 11:29.731
One of Sheldon's BBs
got lodged in there.

11:29.748 --> 11:31.815
And now I no longer feel
comfortable wearing shorts.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.217
No!
Trust me.

11:33.218 --> 11:34.851
You don't want to go
up against Sheldon.

11:34.887 --> 11:36.720
Well, I am going up
against Sheldon.

11:36.755 --> 11:38.222
He's on a whole other level.

11:38.223 --> 11:40.391
But I've got
rightness on my side.

11:40.392 --> 11:42.193
Oh, you've got rightness
on your side.

11:42.194 --> 11:44.261
Okay, then you're good.
Really? You think so?

11:44.296 --> 11:46.064
No, but I just realized...
why am I trying to stop you?

11:46.065 --> 11:47.131
I make commission on these.

11:47.132 --> 11:48.432
So let's get you all set up.

11:48.467 --> 11:50.435
Behold the Vanquisher.

11:50.436 --> 11:51.436
Whoa.

11:51.437 --> 11:52.870
Yeah, she's expensive.

11:52.871 --> 11:54.705
How expensive?
$300.

11:54.706 --> 11:55.873
That's not much.

11:55.874 --> 11:57.075
But with that missile range,

11:57.076 --> 11:58.241
(chuckles) she's worth it.

11:58.277 --> 11:59.477
$300?!

11:59.478 --> 12:00.711
Of money?

12:00.712 --> 12:01.913
It's not about the money, Gene,

12:01.914 --> 12:03.080
it's about the principle.

12:03.115 --> 12:04.315
Yeah, it's about the principle.

12:04.316 --> 12:05.348
Terry, please.

12:05.384 --> 12:06.750
Teach me how to fly it.

12:11.557 --> 12:13.958
Huh, it's actually pretty,
uh, intuitive.

12:13.959 --> 12:16.594
Yep, I probably don't need
to be holding you like this.

12:16.595 --> 12:17.795
No, it helped.

12:17.796 --> 12:19.430
You know, before I let you go...

12:19.431 --> 12:20.797
good luck out there, buddy.
Thanks.

12:20.833 --> 12:23.401
Okay, well, thanks
for coming in.

12:23.402 --> 12:24.619
LINDA: <i>There you go.</i>

12:24.636 --> 12:26.637
Mama's old tap shoes.
How do they feel?

12:26.638 --> 12:29.073
A little loose, but, um,
why am I wearing these?

12:29.074 --> 12:31.476
Because nothing's more
distracting than tap dancing.

12:31.477 --> 12:32.910
When your toes are tapping,

12:32.911 --> 12:34.312
they think the reading
must have happened.

12:34.313 --> 12:35.746
Now, follow me!

12:35.747 --> 12:37.248
And... a tap and a tap
and a tap-tap-tap.

12:37.249 --> 12:38.649
And a tap and a tap and a...

12:38.650 --> 12:40.084
And we're tapping
and we're spinning

12:40.085 --> 12:41.819
and we're spinning
and we're tapping.

12:41.820 --> 12:43.621
Hold on. So when...
 And a shimmy tap, a shimmy tap.

12:43.622 --> 12:45.022
Wait, hold on. We're
still spinning...

12:45.023 --> 12:46.791
A scooby tap, a scooby tap.
Scoo-Scooby tap.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.558
A wiggle tap, a jiggle tap.
Wait. What?

12:48.594 --> 12:50.461
And a shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba.
(panting)

12:50.462 --> 12:52.763
Scooba-dooba-doo, and no one's
even looking at you,

12:52.764 --> 12:55.366
what you didn't do,
and a-scabba-dooba-scabba-dooba,

12:55.367 --> 12:57.168
scabba-dooba-day.
Huh?

12:57.169 --> 12:59.971
And the book report's over,
and you got yourself an "A"!

12:59.972 --> 13:02.974
Ah, maybe B-minus, probably,
in my experience, you know.

13:02.975 --> 13:04.609
Hey. How's the tappin'?

13:04.610 --> 13:06.277
Great! She's like
a jazzy jackhammer!

13:06.278 --> 13:08.012
Watch out, floor!
Oh, yeah.

13:08.013 --> 13:09.814
So, I borrowed Teddy's
wheelbarrow,

13:09.815 --> 13:12.116
and I made it look like a
dogsled, and the only thing is,

13:12.117 --> 13:13.985
he said he wants
to be in your book report,

13:13.986 --> 13:16.187
so I told him I'd pull some
strings, get him a small part,

13:16.188 --> 13:17.855
and anyway, he's gonna meet you
at school tomorrow,

13:17.856 --> 13:19.290
you can work it out then, okay?

13:19.291 --> 13:21.325
Cool? Is that cool?
Very cool!

13:21.326 --> 13:23.794
You could tap with a wheelbarrow
tied around you, right, hon?

13:23.795 --> 13:25.362
Uh...

13:26.565 --> 13:27.999
Got to get up higher somehow,

13:28.000 --> 13:29.901
so I can see onto
his stupid balcony.

13:29.902 --> 13:31.335
Oh!

13:31.336 --> 13:33.237
I'll just climb up
on that roof! (laughs)

13:33.238 --> 13:35.039
Uh... sure, that seems
like a good idea...

13:35.040 --> 13:36.606
of something dangerous to do.

13:36.642 --> 13:38.675
Gene, you stay down there.
Yup, no problem.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.511
Ugh! You're back.

13:40.512 --> 13:42.513
Yeah, I'm back, and I'm armed

13:42.514 --> 13:44.948
with righteousness and this!

13:44.983 --> 13:46.517
The Vanquisher. I see.

13:46.518 --> 13:48.118
Yeah, go inside, Sheldon...

13:48.153 --> 13:49.386
to get your checkbook!

13:49.421 --> 13:50.821
Like her?

13:50.822 --> 13:52.423
I call her the Vanquisherer.

13:52.424 --> 13:54.025
I got it from The Hobby Hole.

13:54.026 --> 13:55.593
And then I added the extra "er"

13:55.594 --> 13:57.460
when I customized
the crap out of it.

13:57.496 --> 13:59.796
Vanquisherer?
That's hard to say.

13:59.831 --> 14:02.132
No, it's not. You just slow down
on the second "er."

14:02.167 --> 14:04.000
Vanquisher-rer?

14:04.036 --> 14:06.236
Look, the point is,
it vanquishes Vanquishers!

14:06.271 --> 14:08.172
Well, not if I vanquish it
first!

14:08.173 --> 14:09.906
Are you suggesting
an air battle?

14:09.942 --> 14:11.609
Perfect! Air battle!

14:11.610 --> 14:13.544
I'm gonna make
your precious helicopter look

14:13.545 --> 14:16.214
like the piece of crap
<i>True Lies</i> one you sold me!

14:16.215 --> 14:19.116
But first, can I shoot you
with a missile in your nipple?

14:19.117 --> 14:20.551
I was really excited about it.

14:20.552 --> 14:22.553
Let me think. No.
Air battle.

14:22.554 --> 14:24.754
All right, fine!
On three. One...

14:24.790 --> 14:27.692
Not to interrupt, but is this
the best way to solve this?

14:27.693 --> 14:29.092
Just asking. Yes! Yes.

14:29.127 --> 14:31.696
Two.
(whirring)

14:31.697 --> 14:33.798
Aah, aah, aah.
Three!

14:33.799 --> 14:35.365
I'm taking you down, Sheldon!
You're gonna regret

14:35.400 --> 14:38.435
the day you... Oh, my God,
you just hit me. That was quick.

14:38.470 --> 14:40.070
Time for the death blow!

14:40.105 --> 14:41.471
Not the death blow!

14:42.774 --> 14:44.407
Huh?
What? Terry?!

14:44.443 --> 14:45.810
Me and the Hobby Hole boys
thought

14:45.811 --> 14:47.411
you could use a little help.

14:47.412 --> 14:49.045
We did inventory
and then we came right over!

14:49.081 --> 14:50.547
Join the battle, brothers!

14:50.582 --> 14:52.550
My favorite things
were eating lunch

14:52.551 --> 14:54.118
and wearing shorts, Sheldon,

14:54.119 --> 14:55.586
and you took it all away!

14:55.587 --> 14:57.421
Now it's time to pay the price!

14:57.422 --> 14:58.789
I didn't eat your delicious

14:58.790 --> 15:00.591
roast beef
and cheddar sandwich, Terry!

15:00.592 --> 15:03.327
But your chopper's
gonna eat this!

15:03.328 --> 15:04.996
("Ride of the Valkyries" plays)

15:04.997 --> 15:07.330
Aah.

15:10.068 --> 15:11.268
Aah!

15:11.937 --> 15:13.937
Aah!

15:13.972 --> 15:16.140
RC net attack!

15:16.141 --> 15:18.508
Aah!
This one's for Jamie Lee!

15:22.981 --> 15:25.349
(yelling) (laughs, whoops)

15:25.350 --> 15:26.883
Whoa!<i> Whoa!</i>

15:26.918 --> 15:27.884
Oh! Oh, my.
Whoa!

15:27.919 --> 15:30.288
No!

15:30.289 --> 15:31.789
Dad, you're on a ledge!

15:31.790 --> 15:33.624
Yeah, but we won the air battle!

15:33.625 --> 15:36.293
Yeah! How's Sheldon's expression,
Gene? Is he sad?

15:36.328 --> 15:38.828
Is he crying?
No, he's eating something,

15:38.864 --> 15:41.499
and he's got a new helicopter,
and it's pointing at you.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.648
Ow! And there's
a dart in your butt.

15:44.649 --> 15:45.863
Father!

15:45.864 --> 15:48.229
Everything's fine, Gene.
I've got everything

15:48.230 --> 15:49.964
under control. Ow!
Gotcha!

15:49.965 --> 15:51.365
Are you sure?!
Yup.

15:51.366 --> 15:53.334
Ow! My butt!
Hoo!

15:53.335 --> 15:55.936
Uh, Bob, should we get you
a ladder or something?

15:55.971 --> 15:58.139
No, Terry!
Take down Sheldon!

15:58.140 --> 15:59.841
Hobby Hole Boys,
give him everything you got!

15:59.842 --> 16:01.274
(war cry)

16:01.310 --> 16:04.846
What? Wait, Dad!
What about the ladder?!

16:04.847 --> 16:06.814
That seems
like a pretty good idea.

16:06.815 --> 16:09.549
I mean, you're on a ledge, and
you've got a butt full of darts!

16:09.585 --> 16:13.588
Yes, but I also have a butt full of...
principles! Oh!

16:13.589 --> 16:15.323
So, yeah,
you guys defeat Sheldon,

16:15.324 --> 16:17.325
and I'll just work
on my upper-body strength,

16:17.326 --> 16:20.094
do some pull-ups, and I'll be
out of here in no time.

16:20.095 --> 16:22.896
I can't... do even one!

16:22.931 --> 16:24.765
You're incredible, Bob.

16:24.766 --> 16:27.200
Time for the... Sky-sassin.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.036
Luckily, I have
my Sky-sassin-assin!

16:29.037 --> 16:30.403
I'll go get it.

16:30.439 --> 16:31.939
Well, I'll wait for you.

16:31.940 --> 16:34.407
What is wrong
with you hobbyists?!

16:34.443 --> 16:38.179
♪ Up here in the Klondike,
it can get pretty cold ♪

16:38.180 --> 16:39.847
♪ The other dogs

16:39.848 --> 16:41.782

(whoops) Yes!

16:52.227 --> 16:53.628
(whoops) That moved me.

16:53.629 --> 16:55.096
So, yeah, you just do that.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.898
And no one will even know
you didn't read it.

16:56.899 --> 16:58.466
Or I could just do it.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.368
Yeah, no, no, you should do it.
You should do it.

17:00.369 --> 17:01.868
It's your thing. You do it.
Right, right, right.

17:01.904 --> 17:05.573
Uh... Aah, aah! I can't!
I can't do it!

17:05.574 --> 17:07.040
Aah! Aah! Aah!
No, no, no, you'll be fine.

17:07.041 --> 17:08.442
Oh, yeah.
You just remember all the steps.

17:08.443 --> 17:09.877
You got those.
Memorize all the lyrics.

17:09.877 --> 17:11.244
Done. And don't mess it up.

17:11.246 --> 17:12.579
Boom.
Uh! Okay!

17:12.580 --> 17:13.881
I'm-I'm gonna go to bed.

17:13.882 --> 17:15.750
Uh. Everything's gonna be fine.

17:15.751 --> 17:17.251
Okay.
Uh. Good night!

17:17.252 --> 17:18.920
Yeah, get your beauty sleep.

17:18.921 --> 17:20.788
Oh, your wheelbarrow, hon.
You might want to... Aah!

17:20.789 --> 17:22.256
Ah, she's fine.
She's got this.

17:22.257 --> 17:23.758
We did good today,
Mom. We did good.

17:23.759 --> 17:25.126
We did.
Yeah.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.594
Hey, you want me to teach you

17:26.595 --> 17:28.596
how to get out of
a speeding ticket? Yes!

17:28.597 --> 17:30.130
Sky-sassin!

17:30.165 --> 17:31.899
Destroy him, Terry,
and I didn't catch

17:31.900 --> 17:34.301
all of your names,
but you guys destroy him, too!

17:34.336 --> 17:36.771
Oh, that's Vance, and that's Will.
Hi. Hey.

17:36.772 --> 17:39.073
Hey, Dad, remember this?

17:39.074 --> 17:41.909
BOB: Some people say you have
to learn to let things go.

17:41.910 --> 17:44.612
I know you don't agree with
them, but I'm starting to think

17:44.613 --> 17:46.614
maybe some people are right.

17:46.615 --> 17:48.783
Listen, here it is high-pitched
like a little girl.

17:48.784 --> 17:51.318
(in high-pitched voice): Some people
say you have to learn to let things go.

17:51.353 --> 17:53.486
Here it is super, super deep,
like a monster.

17:53.522 --> 17:55.322
(in deep, distorted voice):
You have to learn to let things go.

17:55.357 --> 17:56.791
Here it is with a beat under it.
(upbeat tune plays)

17:56.792 --> 17:59.159
You have to learn
to let things go.

17:59.194 --> 18:01.862
No matter how I play it back,
Keyboard Dad sounds

18:01.863 --> 18:04.497
a lot smarter than
Hanging from the Building Dad!

18:04.533 --> 18:05.832
I like the one with the beat.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.702
I came here today
'cause I thought

18:07.703 --> 18:10.972
I needed to learn
to be a heroic man of action.

18:10.973 --> 18:13.307
But look at you.
You're all nuts!

18:13.308 --> 18:15.643
Is anything worth all of this?
I mean, Terry,

18:15.644 --> 18:17.612
I'm sorry you can't wear shorts.

18:17.613 --> 18:20.514
I would be devastated myself,
but still!

18:20.515 --> 18:22.483
Also, just go to a doctor!

18:22.484 --> 18:24.685
Maybe sometimes
the more heroic thing is

18:24.686 --> 18:27.521
to just let it the freak go!

18:27.522 --> 18:31.058
Now, who's gonna be the bigger
man here, and just let it go?!

18:31.059 --> 18:34.694
I-I don't need a refund.
I'll give you your refund.

18:34.730 --> 18:36.530
No, I said it first.
I said it first!

18:36.531 --> 18:37.964
I'm the bigger man.
No, I am!

18:38.000 --> 18:40.200
Sheldon, I'm sorry we ganged up
on you about the food thing!

18:40.235 --> 18:42.003
I'm sorry I ganged up
on all your food!

18:42.004 --> 18:44.472
Well, I forgive you! Thank you.
Can I have my job back?

18:44.473 --> 18:45.873
No, you can't.
It's not up to me.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.308
Remember Roger? He's
in charge of it now.

18:47.309 --> 18:48.709
Can you believe it?

18:48.710 --> 18:50.911
Can someone just get
a ladder already?!

18:50.912 --> 18:54.882
BOB: You know, Gene,
in your own way, you kind of ended up

18:54.883 --> 18:56.984
saving the day today.
Oh, thank God you finally said it.

18:56.985 --> 18:59.153
The whole car ride,
I was, like, "Do I say it?

18:59.154 --> 19:01.522
No, he should be the one to
say it. I'm not gonna say it."

19:01.523 --> 19:03.858
Well, I'm saying it, so, thanks.

19:03.859 --> 19:06.093
Huh. Today started with me
wanting to learn from you,

19:06.094 --> 19:07.928
but then you learned from me.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.997
Does that make me
your dad now? No.

19:09.998 --> 19:12.198
Do you want to switch for
a while? I could take Mondays.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.901
Let's keep it like this for now.

19:13.902 --> 19:17.003
Well, you're still my hero, Dad.
You're mine, too, Gene.

19:17.039 --> 19:19.740
Now how about we go
inside and ice my butt?

19:19.741 --> 19:21.709
I wonder how many other dads
are saying that

19:21.710 --> 19:23.744
to their sons right now.
I bet a lot.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.513
JOCELYN: <i>And that's why</i>

19:25.514 --> 19:28.081
it truly was like
a tale of two cities.

19:28.116 --> 19:29.583
But I feel like maybe next time,

19:29.584 --> 19:31.252
focus on the tale
of just one city.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.854
And maybe that city is
like a yogurt shop

19:33.855 --> 19:35.423
where cool teens work.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.691
I want to work there.
Thank you.

19:36.692 --> 19:40.061
Okay, Jocelyn.
Tina, you're up.

19:40.062 --> 19:42.362
Hi. Hi. Hi, everyone. Uh.

19:42.397 --> 19:44.865
Good job, Jocelyn.
Thank you.

19:44.866 --> 19:48.035
(clears her throat)

19:48.036 --> 19:49.370
(sighs)

19:49.371 --> 19:50.771
(weakly): Ring, ring, ring.

19:50.772 --> 19:54.107
What did she just say?

19:54.142 --> 19:57.078
It's the...
call of the... wild?

19:57.079 --> 19:59.246
Aah! I can't take it!
I can't take it!

19:59.247 --> 20:01.081
(yelling)

20:01.116 --> 20:03.918
(kids gasp,
Tina continues yelling)

20:03.919 --> 20:05.952
(grunting)

20:07.489 --> 20:08.788
Wow. Tina.

20:08.824 --> 20:11.458
That was, uh...
Did you all see that?

20:11.493 --> 20:13.294
That was... Um, I...
I'm-I'm sorry.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.595
...amazing.
Oh.

20:14.596 --> 20:17.098
You just embodied
all the themes of the book.

20:17.099 --> 20:18.666
Huh.
The primitivism,

20:18.667 --> 20:20.300
Buck's return to his
savage nature. Yeah.

20:20.335 --> 20:22.068
The sweating. Great job.

20:22.104 --> 20:24.071
She was really good.
That was really good.

20:24.072 --> 20:26.272
Well, I definitely read the book,
so, thank you. LINDA: Huh.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.943
She changed some things,
but, uh, she still nailed it.

20:28.944 --> 20:31.779
She totally nailed it.
So... say it, Bob.

20:31.780 --> 20:33.347
No.
Say it.

20:33.348 --> 20:35.249
(sighs) You win best
parent of the week.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.650
Yes! Yes! Me!

20:36.651 --> 20:38.252
I thought I won best
parent of the week!

20:38.253 --> 20:39.854
Wait. How did you kids
get out of class?

20:39.855 --> 20:41.255
Hey, don't worry about it.

20:41.256 --> 20:42.656
(panting): Did I miss it?

20:42.657 --> 20:44.792
Tina! Did I miss it?

20:44.793 --> 20:47.528
LINDA:
<i>And a shimmy tap, a shimmy tap.</i>

20:47.529 --> 20:49.764
<i>A scooby tap, a scooby tap.</i>

20:49.765 --> 20:52.800
<i>A shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba,
scooba-dooba-do,</i>

20:52.801 --> 20:55.136
<i>and no one's even looking
at you, what you didn't do.</i>

20:55.137 --> 20:57.972
<i>And a-scabba-dooba-scabba-doo.</i>

20:57.973 --> 21:00.641
<i>Wiggle tap and jiggle tap.</i>

21:00.642 --> 21:03.344
<i>A shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba,
scooba-dooba-do,</i>

21:03.345 --> 21:05.846
<i>and no one's even looking
at you, what you didn't do.</i>

21:05.847 --> 21:08.449
<i>And a-scabba-dooba,
scabba-dooba, scabba-dooba-day.</i>

21:08.450 --> 21:11.284
<i>The book report's over,
and you got yourself an "A"!</i>

21:11.285 --> 21:14.069
<i>Ah, maybe B-minus, probably,
in my experience.</i>

21:14.070 --> 21:17.816
<i>Shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba,
shibba-dabba, shibba-dabba...</i>
