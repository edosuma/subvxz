00:00.671 --> 00:02.249
Previously on...

00:02.273 --> 00:03.680
Your spleen has wandered
close to your heart.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.182
We gotta take it out.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.684
Get your insurance
figured out by then, hmm?

00:07.708 --> 00:09.086
There was the bad news...
There's a cop I want you to talk to.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.119
His name is Sullivan. The
file on Noah's daughter.

00:12.143 --> 00:14.191
The discomforting news...

00:14.215 --> 00:16.323
Thanks.

00:16.347 --> 00:18.325
Are you hiding someone
in your house?

00:18.349 --> 00:20.627
Tell me your secrets.
I'll understand. Okay.

00:20.651 --> 00:22.629
And the news
no one should know...

00:22.653 --> 00:24.663
But you tell me yours first.

00:27.558 --> 00:29.036
Once a month,

00:29.060 --> 00:31.038
the crème de la crème
of Fairview society

00:31.062 --> 00:32.779
would attend
a semiformal luncheon

00:32.803 --> 00:36.213
at the home of Maxine Bennett.

00:36.237 --> 00:39.446
Everyone loved
these elegant get-togethers...

00:39.470 --> 00:41.148
Everyone, that is,

00:41.172 --> 00:43.120
but a certain
redheaded housewife

00:43.144 --> 00:46.723
who was convinced
Maxine was a liar.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.725
You see, Maxine liked to brag

00:48.749 --> 00:51.228
that she did
all her own cooking.

00:51.252 --> 00:55.632
And because each course
was served promptly...

00:55.656 --> 00:58.105
Presented with flair...

00:58.129 --> 01:00.067
It's delicious.

01:00.091 --> 01:03.210
And was
positively mouthwatering,

01:03.234 --> 01:06.143
Bree knew Maxine had
had some help.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.145
Thank you so much.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.117
And sadly for Maxine,

01:10.141 --> 01:13.320
Bree intended to prove it.

01:13.344 --> 01:15.687
Maxine, once again,
this entire lunch

01:15.711 --> 01:18.054
was just out of this
world.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.087
I just have to get
the number of your caterer.

01:20.111 --> 01:21.588
What a nice compliment.

01:21.612 --> 01:24.091
No, I'm afraid
this is all my doing.

01:24.115 --> 01:26.193
It was a triumph,
an absolute triumph.

01:26.217 --> 01:29.196
Oh, come on. Do you honestly
expect us to believe

01:29.220 --> 01:32.139
that you had the time to prepare
a 6-course meal for 10 women?

01:32.163 --> 01:33.440
Even I couldn't make this

01:33.464 --> 01:35.681
andhave time
to get ready for a party.

01:35.705 --> 01:39.606
Well, perhaps you're just not
as organized as I am.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.771
If you'll excuse me.

01:44.275 --> 01:46.353
Bree! What's gotten into you?

01:46.377 --> 01:49.156
I have the same recipe
for English plum pudding.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.358
It takes six hours to prepare.

01:51.382 --> 01:53.360
How would she have time
to make all of this

01:53.384 --> 01:55.201
and everything else
that we ate today?

01:55.225 --> 01:58.165
This is not the pudding
of an honest woman.

01:58.189 --> 02:00.197
FBI! Open up!

02:00.221 --> 02:02.399
What on earth?

02:09.699 --> 02:11.678
We're looking
for a Maxine Bennett.

02:11.702 --> 02:14.586
I'm Maxine. We have a warrant
to search the premises, ma'am.

02:14.610 --> 02:17.284
A warrant?
I'm in the middle of a luncheon.

02:17.308 --> 02:18.508
Over here.

02:21.272 --> 02:22.789
Found her.

02:22.813 --> 02:25.121
What?!

02:25.145 --> 02:27.294
Maxine Bennett,
you're under arrest

02:27.318 --> 02:29.896
for involuntary servitude.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.898
Is this the woman
who locked you up?

02:43.163 --> 02:46.513
Bree, what's going on?

02:46.537 --> 02:50.146
Well, I'm not sure,
but I think Maxine had a slave.

02:50.170 --> 02:54.821
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

02:54.845 --> 02:56.483
But Bree could.

02:56.507 --> 02:59.526
You see, for her,

02:59.550 --> 03:07.550
the proof was in the pudding.

03:09.620 --> 03:13.240
The world is filled
with unlikely friendships,

03:13.264 --> 03:17.173
odd pairings,
that to the casual observer,

03:17.197 --> 03:21.208
make absolutely no sense at all.

03:21.232 --> 03:23.710
But if we look closer,

03:23.734 --> 03:27.514
we can see why
these alliances form.

03:27.538 --> 03:29.516
After all, a shared purpose

03:29.540 --> 03:34.391
can give even mortal enemies
common ground.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.393
Bree?
We have a question for you.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.894
Oh! What is it?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.896
Well, we were just wondering...

03:39.920 --> 03:42.198
Actually, we were curious
about, um...

03:42.222 --> 03:45.939
What the hell's going on with you
and Betty applewhite? Yeah, that.

03:45.963 --> 03:47.274
Excuse me?

03:47.298 --> 03:49.276
Well, from the day
that dead body showed up,

03:49.300 --> 03:51.608
nobody was yelling, "oh,
the applewhites are involved!"

03:51.632 --> 03:53.310
Louder than you.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.917
And the next thing we know,

03:54.941 --> 03:56.913
you're having Betty over
for poker. What gives?

03:56.937 --> 04:00.617
She makes it sound like we're angry,
and we're not angry. I'm a little angry.

04:00.641 --> 04:03.490
Can we talk about this later?
I-I have ice cream in here.

04:03.514 --> 04:05.961
Bree, could this flip-flop have
something to do with the fact

04:05.985 --> 04:08.325
that Danielle is dating Matthew?

04:08.349 --> 04:10.257
I knew that would get her.

04:10.281 --> 04:12.329
Who told you that?

04:12.353 --> 04:15.507
Mrs. Mcclusky. She saw them
making out in the park. Edie!

04:15.531 --> 04:17.764
What? Can't you
sugarcoat it a little?

04:17.788 --> 04:18.935
I did.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.007
He had his hand
down her shirt.

04:22.031 --> 04:24.376
Bree, we know
that you have a good reason

04:24.400 --> 04:26.373
for wanting Betty
to hang out with us.

04:26.397 --> 04:29.476
We just... wondered if you
could clue us in a little.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.478
When it comes
to Betty applewhite,

04:31.502 --> 04:32.979
I know what I'm doing,

04:33.003 --> 04:36.523
and you two are just
gonna have to trust me.

04:36.547 --> 04:38.024
And if you can't do that,

04:38.048 --> 04:40.387
then perhaps I've overestimated
the depth of our friendship.

04:40.411 --> 04:41.888
Now, if you'll excuse me...

04:41.912 --> 04:43.860
What a bitch.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.992
Edie, can you...

04:46.016 --> 04:47.686
Iwassugarcoating it.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.504
Hey.

04:57.528 --> 04:58.575
Oh! Hi.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.277
Hey, none of that in here.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.580
Come on. Maybe if we remind ed
that I'm shacking up

05:03.604 --> 05:06.461
with the senior v.P., he'll stop
killing all my pitches.

05:06.485 --> 05:08.485
You've only been here a week.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.488
Why don't you give yourself a break? Honey,
you know the ad game.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.060
I've only got a certain amount
of time to make my Mark

05:14.084 --> 05:16.067
before he kicks me to the curb.

05:16.091 --> 05:18.495
Look, I'm just asking you...
Jump in every once in a while,

05:18.519 --> 05:21.498
throw me some rope, you know, when
Ed's on the warpath. I can't protect you.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.336
You're gonna have to find a way
to click with ed yourself.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.374
And then the pig... he rubs his
stomach and he goes...

05:27.398 --> 05:29.376
"Farm fresh bacon

05:29.400 --> 05:31.738
will make a piggy out of you,
too."

05:37.007 --> 05:38.745
So...

05:38.769 --> 05:41.588
The pig actually eats the bacon?

05:41.612 --> 05:44.529
Uh-huh, yeah. I don't see
the client doing a happy dance

05:44.553 --> 05:47.075
over the whole
cannibalism theme.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.528
Well, Tom, why don't
you pitch him the other idea

05:51.552 --> 05:55.036
you came up with last night?
You know, the one where

05:55.060 --> 05:57.764
people love bacon so much
they wanna keep it a secret?

05:57.788 --> 05:59.706
What, like a secret underground
society of bacon eaters?

05:59.730 --> 06:01.768
More like my college fraternity,
where, you know,

06:01.792 --> 06:05.079
everybody wanted in, but we only
took the coolest guys.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.514
Wait, you were Greek?

06:07.538 --> 06:09.716
Yeah, Alpha tau omega.

06:09.740 --> 06:11.448
I was phi kapp. You?

06:11.472 --> 06:14.350
And I don't remember you having
to be that cool to pledge a.T.O.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.584
Look, if I had a nickel
for every phi kapp

06:17.608 --> 06:20.427
that I tied naked
to a freeway sign...

06:20.451 --> 06:23.059
Scavo, if you were my pledge, I'd have
made you my bitch. Oh, you think so?

06:23.083 --> 06:26.663
You know what? I'm liking
this whole fraternity angle.

06:28.419 --> 06:31.398
Yeah. You know what?
Let's talk about it over lunch.

06:31.422 --> 06:33.822
You're buying.

06:34.965 --> 06:37.125
Go.

06:40.571 --> 06:41.848
Thanks for your help.

06:48.779 --> 06:50.817
Hello. What's going on?

06:50.841 --> 06:53.520
Gabrielle,
I want you to meet someone.

06:53.544 --> 06:55.462
This is xiao-Mei.

06:55.486 --> 06:57.464
She's the young lady
who was forced to work

06:57.488 --> 06:59.796
for Maxine Bennett.
Oh, the slave.

06:59.820 --> 07:03.399
Wow. Looks well-fed.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.440
The church
is making arrangements

07:05.464 --> 07:07.434
for her to return to China.

07:07.458 --> 07:08.575
But until then,
she needs a place to stay.

07:08.599 --> 07:11.037
So I offered up our guest room.

07:11.061 --> 07:13.580
Really?

07:13.604 --> 07:16.621
Baby, can I talk
to you for a second?

07:16.645 --> 07:19.015
Ahem.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.517
Are you nuts?!

07:20.541 --> 07:22.919
It's only for a couple of days. Oh,
thistime.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.420
You are quickly becoming

07:24.444 --> 07:26.528
father crowley's go-to guy
for charity cases.

07:26.552 --> 07:28.755
And that's a bad thing?
When he turns our house

07:28.779 --> 07:31.027
into a catholic
underground railroad, yes!

07:31.051 --> 07:34.030
You know who you are, Gaby?
You're the kind of person

07:34.054 --> 07:37.041
who would've turned away
Mary and Joseph from the inn.

07:37.065 --> 07:39.606
Well, they should've
called ahead.

07:47.498 --> 07:49.776
Don't brush your hair
at the table.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.918
Oh, you're talking to me?

07:51.942 --> 07:53.920
Does this mean
you've finally forgiven me?

07:53.944 --> 07:55.552
Why should I?

07:55.576 --> 07:57.554
You betrayed this family,
and you're not even sorry.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.486
Don't be such a drama queen.

07:59.510 --> 08:01.187
If the applewhites
go to the police

08:01.211 --> 08:04.861
and tell them that your brother
ran over Mrs. Solis,

08:04.885 --> 08:07.093
he could go to prison.

08:07.117 --> 08:09.095
How can you not understand that?

08:09.119 --> 08:10.597
They won't talk about Andrew

08:10.621 --> 08:13.199
as long as you don't go
to the police about Caleb.

08:13.223 --> 08:15.206
What did this Caleb do, exactly?

08:15.230 --> 08:17.544
And why on earth
are they hiding him?

08:17.568 --> 08:19.546
Why don't you go
to Mrs. Applewhite

08:19.570 --> 08:22.649
and tell her you really need
to know what's going on?

08:22.673 --> 08:25.216
I bet if you were really nice,
she'd tell you the truth.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.714
Is that what
you really think, Danielle?

08:27.738 --> 08:30.517
I should go
to Mrs. Applewhite, be nice,

08:30.541 --> 08:33.860
and then she'll hand over
all her secrets?

08:33.884 --> 08:35.692
Yeah.

08:35.716 --> 08:40.667
When I was young, my stepmother
told me that I was very lucky.

08:40.691 --> 08:45.872
I possessed beauty,
wit, cunning and insight.

08:45.896 --> 08:50.677
These were weapons all women
needed to survive in the world.

08:50.701 --> 08:52.609
So?

08:52.633 --> 08:55.286
So take good care
of your looks, Danielle.

08:55.310 --> 08:57.805
You don't have any other weapons
at your disposal.

09:05.175 --> 09:07.994
Hi. I need an operation
on my spleen,

09:08.018 --> 09:10.697
and I just found out
I don't have medical insurance.

09:10.721 --> 09:13.159
Is there anyone I can sue?

09:13.183 --> 09:16.207
After the embezzlement,
lonny let the policy lapse.

09:16.231 --> 09:18.765
And now he's in jail,
and I'm gonna die.

09:18.789 --> 09:20.266
Susie, you're not gonna die.

09:20.290 --> 09:23.169
I'll get into it
with the insurance company.

09:23.193 --> 09:25.677
No, there isn't time for you
to deal with the red tape.

09:25.701 --> 09:28.244
My spleen is going careening
into my heart.

09:28.268 --> 09:31.978
I need that operation now. Yeah,
I'd loan you the money myself,

09:32.002 --> 09:34.080
but Edie and I just
plopped down our savings

09:34.104 --> 09:35.582
in a ski condo and...

09:35.606 --> 09:39.125
I don't need a loan.
I need coverage.

09:39.149 --> 09:41.728
I mean, what if there
are complications?

09:41.752 --> 09:43.730
I don't have a safety net.

09:43.754 --> 09:46.032
Oh, my god, please!

09:46.056 --> 09:48.665
What in the hell are you doing?

09:48.689 --> 09:50.266
I'm saying a little prayer.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.838
Oh, for puke's sake...

09:51.862 --> 09:54.809
Well, what? I'm desperate here.
Do you have any other ideas?

09:54.833 --> 09:57.203
As a matter of fact, I do.

09:57.227 --> 09:59.205
What you need is a husband.

09:59.229 --> 10:00.777
What?

10:00.801 --> 10:03.109
The only way
to get a good health plan

10:03.133 --> 10:04.811
is to marry into one.

10:04.835 --> 10:06.983
Edie, come on.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.985
No, no, I think
she's onto something.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.058
Yeah. If we find a guy
with the right plan,

10:12.082 --> 10:14.766
you could have a sham wedding
on a Monday night

10:14.790 --> 10:16.793
and be fully covered
Tuesday morning.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.696
I can't believe you're
actually considering this.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.998
The surgeon is slicing me open
a week from tomorrow.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.600
What other choice do I have?

10:24.624 --> 10:27.964
All we have to do is find a guy
who's willing to marry you.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.710
You know, come to think of it,

10:33.734 --> 10:36.844
a little prayer might not be
such a bad idea after all.

10:47.377 --> 10:48.855
Pat, we're all here,

10:48.879 --> 10:52.349
so send the call in
as soon as you get it.

10:54.855 --> 10:58.835
200 bucks says you can't do that
3 times in a row.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.937
Huh?

11:00.961 --> 11:03.269
You catch three of those...

11:03.293 --> 11:04.671
200 bucks.

11:04.695 --> 11:06.743
What do you say there, Scavo?

11:06.767 --> 11:09.816
You're on.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.678
Here we go. Ah-ah-ah-ah!

11:11.702 --> 11:13.419
Thrown byme.

11:13.443 --> 11:15.430
I'm sorry,
I thought we were here

11:15.454 --> 11:18.184
to talk about
the farm fresh rollout?

11:18.208 --> 11:21.788
They gotta be catchable, big guy.
You just let me worry about the shooting.

11:21.812 --> 11:22.812
Come on.

11:25.716 --> 11:27.363
That's one.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.387
Guys...

11:29.820 --> 11:31.798
Oh!

11:31.822 --> 11:32.999
Nice moves.

11:33.023 --> 11:35.050
One more, big guy.
Guys, please...

11:35.074 --> 11:36.695
That's... all right.

11:38.729 --> 11:39.776
Ow!

11:39.800 --> 11:42.278
Oh!

11:42.302 --> 11:43.679
Ow.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.387
That wasn't even catchable!
Yeah, well, maybe not.

11:46.411 --> 11:49.115
But it's totally worth
the 200 bucks. Ahh!

11:49.139 --> 11:50.116
Whoo!

11:50.140 --> 11:52.118
Well, you got me.

11:52.142 --> 11:54.120
You're a regular
little monkey man!

11:54.144 --> 11:56.154
Oh, I love this guy.

12:03.053 --> 12:05.233
Oh. Hi.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.806
Do you have to sit around
all day?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.808
I mean, shouldn't you be out

12:11.832 --> 12:13.109
experiencing
western civilization

12:13.133 --> 12:15.842
while you have the chance?

12:15.866 --> 12:18.314
What are you doing?

12:18.338 --> 12:19.445
I fix.

12:19.469 --> 12:21.117
No, this is couture!

12:21.141 --> 12:23.920
This rip has to be fixed
by an experienced tailor.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.421
You can't just...

12:25.445 --> 12:27.824
Holy crap!
This stitching is perfect!

12:27.848 --> 12:29.848
Hungry?

12:35.255 --> 12:37.425
Did you make all of this?

12:39.790 --> 12:41.137
Oh!

12:41.161 --> 12:44.461
For me? Okay.

12:48.839 --> 12:50.116
Oh, my god!

12:50.140 --> 12:51.878
You like?

12:51.902 --> 12:53.542
I like a lot.

13:07.517 --> 13:09.495
You like that?

13:09.519 --> 13:11.838
Yeah, that's nice.

13:11.862 --> 13:14.140
Do you know what they do
to people in China

13:14.164 --> 13:16.147
who speak out against
the government? Hmm?

13:16.171 --> 13:18.144
They put them
in forced labor camps.

13:18.168 --> 13:19.775
Isn't that awful?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.107
Mm-hmm.

13:21.131 --> 13:24.510
You know what I mean?
It's such a repressive regime.

13:24.534 --> 13:26.521
We forget how good we have it.

13:26.545 --> 13:29.055
Yes, we do.

13:29.079 --> 13:30.917
Don't you think xiao-Mei

13:30.941 --> 13:33.389
would like it better here
in america?

13:33.413 --> 13:35.391
I mean, where she could learn

13:35.415 --> 13:38.825
about freedom and democracy
and stuff?

13:38.849 --> 13:40.827
Does this have anything to do

13:40.851 --> 13:42.969
with you making xiao-Mei
do housework?

13:42.993 --> 13:45.410
What? I came downstairs this
morning and found her waxing the floor.

13:45.434 --> 13:48.274
She told me you asked her
to put on two coats.

13:48.298 --> 13:51.107
Well, first of all,
that was her idea.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.109
Second of all,
I can't have this conversation

13:53.133 --> 13:56.013
until you've tasted
her crab puffs. Oh...

13:58.168 --> 14:00.216
Hmm. Mmm.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.818
She just got done being a slave.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.992
I mean, she wants
to go back to China...

14:06.016 --> 14:07.994
And we can't force her
to stay here and be our maid.

14:08.018 --> 14:09.495
Well, who's forcing her?

14:09.519 --> 14:11.497
We'll pay her
whatever she wants.

14:11.521 --> 14:14.130
And the best part is,
with her résumé,

14:14.154 --> 14:16.132
anywage will look good.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.856
No way, baby. Mnh-mnh.

14:19.129 --> 14:20.106
Hmm.

14:20.130 --> 14:21.437
What?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.910
What?

14:23.934 --> 14:26.221
What, so you don't get
what you want,

14:26.245 --> 14:28.214
you just walk off and pout?

14:28.238 --> 14:31.317
Oh, this isn't about me.
This is about our great nation.

14:31.341 --> 14:33.880
And I have no intention
of sexually satisfying a man

14:33.904 --> 14:35.887
who isn't willing
to stand up for

14:35.911 --> 14:37.884
and help spread
the ideals and values

14:37.908 --> 14:40.008
of the United States of america.

14:43.553 --> 14:45.536
And sometimes sheis
a little hard to stomach,

14:45.560 --> 14:47.533
but she means well.
Well, that's...

14:47.557 --> 14:49.535
Hi! Oh, here she is.

14:49.559 --> 14:52.068
I came as soon as I got
your message. Is this...

14:52.092 --> 14:53.900
This is Gary grantham,
your future ex-husband.

14:53.924 --> 14:56.342
Wow, nice to meet you. Hi.

14:56.366 --> 14:58.344
Okay, listen, um,
I've got to meet a client.

14:58.368 --> 15:00.406
I've got to go,
so just talk amongst yourselves,

15:00.430 --> 15:03.409
and you two make
a very handsome couple.

15:03.433 --> 15:04.450
Oh.

15:04.474 --> 15:07.453
Yeah.

15:07.477 --> 15:10.156
Uh, hi. Hi.

15:10.180 --> 15:12.158
So do you wanna
get married on Wednesday?

15:12.182 --> 15:14.660
'Cause Thursday and Friday
I'm out of town.

15:14.684 --> 15:16.671
Oh! Oh, yeah. Sure, that's...
Wednesday's great.

15:16.695 --> 15:19.025
I'm... I'm just curious...

15:19.049 --> 15:21.527
How did Edie convince you
to do this so quickly?

15:21.551 --> 15:23.429
Well, she explained
your situation to me.

15:23.453 --> 15:26.340
I'm sort of in need
of a fake bride myself,

15:26.364 --> 15:28.334
so I figured, what the heck?

15:28.358 --> 15:30.206
Why would you need a fake bride?

15:30.230 --> 15:33.309
Uh, I'm gay, and I've never
come out to my mother.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.580
Really?

15:34.604 --> 15:36.988
Yeah. At first, I just
didn't want to upset her.

15:37.012 --> 15:39.485
Then she got older, she got
emphysema and diverticulitis,

15:39.509 --> 15:42.088
and I started thinking,
if I just kept my mouth shut,

15:42.112 --> 15:44.090
then one day nature
would take its course

15:44.114 --> 15:47.994
and we could avoid what is sure
to be a very ugly scene.

15:48.018 --> 15:49.355
So what changed?

15:49.379 --> 15:52.358
She told me at her
81st birthday party last month,

15:52.382 --> 15:56.039
the only reason she's hanging on
is to see me get married.

15:56.063 --> 15:59.105
Oh. Oh, so by marrying me...

15:59.129 --> 16:02.038
Yeah, I'd get my inheritance
that much sooner.

16:02.062 --> 16:05.411
No, but mostly,
I wanna make sure she's happy.

16:05.435 --> 16:06.942
Mm-hmm.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.946
Well, you seem very nice, Susan.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.419
Uh, it will be a pleasure
being married to you.

16:13.443 --> 16:15.581
Uh, likewise.

16:15.605 --> 16:18.105
Here, you can finish
the rest of the fries.

16:25.515 --> 16:28.064
Here's your mail and your pills.

16:28.088 --> 16:32.018
Ugh. More pills?

16:40.130 --> 16:41.107
Miss tillman?

16:41.131 --> 16:42.178
Hmm?

16:42.202 --> 16:44.980
Where did this come from?

16:45.004 --> 16:48.144
I don't know.
It was in with your other mail.

16:52.142 --> 16:54.142
Get me the phone.

17:03.553 --> 17:05.031
Sullivan, it's me.

17:05.055 --> 17:08.034
I just got some news,
and I need to get you involved.

17:08.058 --> 17:12.728
Looks like Delfino's
been holding out on me.

17:22.412 --> 17:25.256
The next morning,
Bree came up with a plan

17:25.280 --> 17:28.022
to get to the truth
she so desperately needed.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.026
As she watched the applewhites
leave their house,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.299
she thought of how much

17:33.323 --> 17:36.031
she had trusted
the previous owners

17:36.055 --> 17:37.763
and how much they...

17:37.787 --> 17:40.566
Had trusted her.

18:01.311 --> 18:03.681
Caleb? Is that you?

18:08.118 --> 18:10.796
Hi.

18:10.820 --> 18:14.540
I'm Bree.
I live down the street.

18:14.564 --> 18:16.842
I'm a friend of your mother's.

18:16.866 --> 18:18.804
She's not home.

18:18.828 --> 18:21.407
I know. Um...

18:21.431 --> 18:23.379
I came to see you.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.381
Me?

18:25.405 --> 18:28.384
Yes. Your mother told me
all about you and I thought it...

18:28.408 --> 18:33.189
It might be nice if, um,
we had a little visit.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.523
I brought you
some homemade cobbler.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.130
♪ oh, la, la, la, la, la ♪

18:44.154 --> 18:46.837
Right here.
Follow the doughnut, people.

18:46.861 --> 18:49.435
Here we go. We got some people.
Come on, come on.

18:49.459 --> 18:51.137
Hey, hey... huh?

18:51.161 --> 18:52.438
What's going on?

18:52.462 --> 18:54.780
Well, um, ed bet Tom that
he wouldn't eat a doughnut

18:54.804 --> 18:56.782
out of the toilet.

18:56.806 --> 19:00.146
Isn't it disgusting?

19:00.170 --> 19:01.247
Unh-unh!

19:01.271 --> 19:02.248
Huh?

19:02.272 --> 19:03.749
It's gotta be fully dunked.

19:03.773 --> 19:06.227
Now, I don't want the glaze
to repel the water.

19:06.251 --> 19:08.794
Whoa, slight delay, people.
I'm requesting a scrub down.

19:08.818 --> 19:12.258
Does anybody know where
they keep the toilet brush?

19:12.282 --> 19:15.266
Just for one second, okay?
Just for one second.

19:15.290 --> 19:17.763
Hey, I never thought
I'd have to ask you this,

19:17.787 --> 19:20.766
but are you about to eat a
doughnut out of the toilet? Yeah!

19:20.790 --> 19:22.268
For the galveston jewelers
account.

19:22.292 --> 19:25.316
I don't care! You're not
gonna do this! Look, Lynette,

19:25.340 --> 19:28.314
you're the one who told me
to find a way to click with ed.

19:28.338 --> 19:30.546
Well, now we've got our thing,
andit's paying off for me!

19:30.570 --> 19:32.678
That's because ed gets off
on humiliating you.

19:32.702 --> 19:35.251
Please, don't do this!

19:35.275 --> 19:37.575
We're waiting, Scavo!

19:38.878 --> 19:40.356
Tom, Tom, Tom!

19:40.380 --> 19:41.827
Okay, okay, what now?

19:41.851 --> 19:43.511
This is my moment.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.797
So, Caleb,
besides your mother and brother,

19:51.821 --> 19:55.271
does anybody else
know that you're here?

19:55.295 --> 19:57.195
No.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.676
You're pretty.

20:02.372 --> 20:04.310
Thank you. That's very sweet.

20:04.334 --> 20:07.891
So where have you been living
this whole time? Upstairs?

20:07.915 --> 20:10.816
No.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.718
I just moved upstairs.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.220
My room's downstairs.

20:14.244 --> 20:15.591
Downstairs?

20:15.615 --> 20:18.864
In the basement.

20:18.888 --> 20:20.948
You wanna see it?

20:46.276 --> 20:49.255
Caleb, have you been down here
all these months?

20:49.279 --> 20:51.327
Yeah.

20:51.351 --> 20:54.800
Did your mother
make you wear those?

20:54.824 --> 20:57.303
Most of the time.

20:57.327 --> 21:01.407
Oh, my god!

21:01.431 --> 21:04.340
Sweetheart, I don't understand.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.374
Why in the world would
your mother treat you that way?

21:09.439 --> 21:11.717
I hurt a girl.

21:11.741 --> 21:13.571
A girl?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.345
Yeah.

21:20.410 --> 21:23.359
And then she died.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.423
Oh.

21:26.856 --> 21:29.756
Her name was Melanie.

21:32.021 --> 21:34.861
She was pretty.

21:37.427 --> 21:39.967
Just like you.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.310
Hi.

21:56.416 --> 22:00.295
I thought you should know,
I'm getting married.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.967
To the doctor?

22:01.991 --> 22:04.330
No! No. Ha!

22:04.354 --> 22:07.503
No, to... to a gay guy.

22:07.527 --> 22:10.005
How did you know
about the doctor?

22:10.029 --> 22:13.479
People talk. So you...
You're marrying a gay guy?

22:13.503 --> 22:14.780
I need health insurance,

22:14.804 --> 22:16.847
um, 'cause I've got
this wandering spleen and...

22:16.871 --> 22:18.484
That sounds funny,

22:18.508 --> 22:20.346
"spleen wandering," but...

22:20.370 --> 22:23.349
Actually, it's not funny 'cause
it can bang into things...

22:23.373 --> 22:26.527
So I need health insurance,
so I'm getting married tomorrow.

22:26.551 --> 22:28.524
And you probably think
I'm crazy, right?

22:28.548 --> 22:31.497
Well... can it wait?

22:31.521 --> 22:33.699
Um, the surgery?

22:33.723 --> 22:36.462
No. It can't wait.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.665
I guess it's really
not that crazy.

22:42.031 --> 22:43.609
How you doin', ma'am?

22:43.633 --> 22:46.116
Susan, can you just
give me a minute?

22:46.140 --> 22:47.373
Oh, yeah. No, I'm sorry.

22:47.397 --> 22:49.597
I... that was really... it.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.649
What do you want?

22:53.673 --> 22:55.350
It's not whatiwant, Delfino.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.523
It's what Noah Taylor wants.

22:57.547 --> 23:00.125
Where's his grandkid?

23:00.149 --> 23:02.127
You know, let's skip the part

23:02.151 --> 23:04.129
where you don't know
anything about anything.

23:04.153 --> 23:05.891
Mr. Taylor wants to chat.

23:05.915 --> 23:08.464
What if I say no?

23:08.488 --> 23:10.466
Then I've gotta
find the kid myself,

23:10.490 --> 23:15.441
and my guess is, he or she is
somewhere around here close.

23:15.465 --> 23:18.003
Your old girlfriend...

23:18.027 --> 23:19.975
She's got a daughter, right?

23:19.999 --> 23:23.709
Maybe I should start
by payinghera visit...

23:23.733 --> 23:26.452
Her daughter's not the one.

23:26.476 --> 23:28.454
Yeah, well,
given your track record,

23:28.478 --> 23:31.417
I might wanna check that out
for myself.

23:31.441 --> 23:33.941
Tell him I'll be there
in the morning.

23:40.850 --> 23:43.899
Oh!

23:43.923 --> 23:45.571
So pretty.

23:45.595 --> 23:48.434
You like nice things?

23:50.630 --> 23:52.608
That's why
I think you're stupid,

23:52.632 --> 23:54.680
for not wanting to stay here.

23:54.704 --> 23:57.621
You could be around
mynice things all the time,

23:57.645 --> 23:59.815
taking care of them...

23:59.839 --> 24:02.448
How fun would that be?

24:02.472 --> 24:05.951
Well, I'm sure it's a lot
more fun than you'd have

24:05.975 --> 24:08.815
in that tiny,
godforsaken village of yours.

24:13.182 --> 24:15.160
You know,
we're probably more alike

24:15.184 --> 24:17.503
than people would guess.

24:17.527 --> 24:20.435
I'm from a small town, too.
My folks had nothing.

24:20.459 --> 24:24.989
That's why I love america.
Anything is possible.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.878
Oh...

24:32.902 --> 24:34.672
Hmm, you like that?

24:35.975 --> 24:37.222
No.

24:37.246 --> 24:40.185
An old, fat stockbroker
gave this to me.

24:40.209 --> 24:43.589
It's not worth anything.
You can have it.

24:43.613 --> 24:45.483
Oh...

24:47.757 --> 24:48.934
Oh!

24:51.691 --> 24:53.138
Oh!

24:53.162 --> 24:56.272
It's okay. Glad you like it.

24:58.267 --> 25:00.506
You can brush my hair.

25:00.530 --> 25:02.170
Oh!

25:12.812 --> 25:14.990
- I loved it!
- It was nice.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.121
Hi.

25:16.145 --> 25:18.624
Hi. Hi.

25:18.648 --> 25:21.697
Uh, this is the best
I could do on such short notice.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.570
Okay.

25:24.594 --> 25:25.671
Okay.

25:31.561 --> 25:34.580
Oh, uh, Susan, this is, uh,
my best man, Steven.

25:34.604 --> 25:35.691
He's also my life partner.

25:35.715 --> 25:38.565
Oh, hi. It's nice to meet you.

25:39.909 --> 25:42.639
Baby, be... be nice. Come on.

25:43.843 --> 25:46.191
I'm sorry you have cancer.

25:46.215 --> 25:47.893
Cancer?

25:47.917 --> 25:51.757
Isn't that the point
of this wholecharade?

25:51.781 --> 25:53.829
Gary said you needed insurance.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.710
Oh, yes. No, no,
I do need insurance.

25:55.734 --> 26:00.055
I just don't have cancer.
I have a... wandering spleen.

26:02.291 --> 26:04.740
I said it waslikecancer.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.772
Is there a problem?

26:06.796 --> 26:08.644
No. No, everything's fine.

26:08.668 --> 26:11.298
Uh, let's just go to the chapel.
Shall we?

26:13.643 --> 26:16.922
I made a wedding cake.
I hope you enjoy it.

26:16.946 --> 26:18.876
Oh! Uh...

26:23.683 --> 26:26.066
So... are we ready
to get started?

26:26.090 --> 26:28.634
Oh, do you have
a thing to play music?

26:28.658 --> 26:30.636
I had Steven burn a little
wedding mix for us,

26:30.660 --> 26:31.637
for ambience.

26:31.661 --> 26:35.140
Sure, just, um, give me a sec.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.046
Do you have a problem?

26:41.070 --> 26:42.948
You said she was sick.

26:42.972 --> 26:46.051
Sheis.
She has a wandering spleen.

26:46.075 --> 26:49.214
It sounds nothing like cancer.
It doesn't even sound real.

26:49.238 --> 26:52.157
Well, it is. I-I could die.
You look fine to me, honey.

26:52.181 --> 26:53.859
Don'tdo this.

26:53.883 --> 26:55.861
I have asked you six times

26:55.885 --> 26:57.993
to fly with me to Holland
to get married,

26:58.017 --> 26:59.765
and you always have
some lame excuse.

26:59.789 --> 27:03.168
But the second some chick with
a silly disease comes along,

27:03.192 --> 27:06.076
well, you drop everything
and head for a chapel.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.733
Oh, no, it's a serious illness.

27:07.757 --> 27:11.737
See, it just sounds silly
'cause of the word "spleen."

27:11.761 --> 27:14.039
What do you want from me? I
want you to worry about my feelings

27:14.063 --> 27:16.320
half as much as you worry
about your mother's!

27:16.344 --> 27:19.114
What is it gonna take
to make you happy?

27:19.138 --> 27:21.987
Not go through with the wedding?
Is that what you're asking?

27:22.011 --> 27:23.989
Oh, oh! No, no,
stop right there.

27:24.013 --> 27:26.927
Okay, I would love to see
you two crazy kids get hitched

27:26.951 --> 27:29.695
in Holland more than anyone,
with the tulips and the clogs,

27:29.719 --> 27:32.698
in front of a windmill,
the whole shebang.

27:32.722 --> 27:35.706
But unless I get this surgery,
my spleen is going to slam

27:35.730 --> 27:37.663
straight into my heart
and explode.

27:37.687 --> 27:39.665
So, you know, seeing
as I am just a nice person

27:39.689 --> 27:42.668
and I always support gay rights,
let's just do this.

27:42.692 --> 27:45.671
And then I'll have
a husband and insurance.

27:45.695 --> 27:47.735
Nobody gets hurt.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.650
Steven, why... Steven!

27:55.674 --> 27:56.961
It's just...

27:56.985 --> 27:58.806
Yeah.

28:00.409 --> 28:03.328
I'm so sorry. My hands are tied.

28:03.352 --> 28:05.682
I'm really sorry.

28:08.718 --> 28:10.365
Steven, wait. Steven...

28:10.389 --> 28:12.367
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

28:12.391 --> 28:14.669
♪ oh, oh, oh ♪

28:14.693 --> 28:17.773
♪ What's love got to do,
got to do with it? ♪

28:17.797 --> 28:20.275
Ah, finally got
the sound system working.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.207
♪ What's love
but a secondhand emotion? ♪

28:22.231 --> 28:24.209
Where's the groom?

28:24.233 --> 28:27.383
♪ What's love got to do,
got to do with it? ♪

28:41.220 --> 28:44.399
Hey, susie q.

28:44.423 --> 28:45.901
What's wrong?

28:45.925 --> 28:48.904
For a newlywed, you don't have
much spring in your step.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.206
I didn't get married.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.808
Really?

28:52.832 --> 28:54.109
We got to the altar,

28:54.133 --> 28:58.243
but the whole fake wedding thing
sort of imploded.

28:58.267 --> 29:02.818
Wow. I'm sorry.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.350
I still don't have insurance.

29:05.374 --> 29:07.352
I need to get that operation.

29:07.376 --> 29:08.746
I'm...

29:10.980 --> 29:12.820
I'm really screwed.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.834
Well...

29:20.860 --> 29:23.208
Why don't I just marry you?

29:23.232 --> 29:25.470
What? I've got a
fantastic health plan.

29:25.494 --> 29:27.151
You'd be covered instantly.

29:27.175 --> 29:31.476
But... we were actually married.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.349
Look, susie,
I've always felt awful

29:34.373 --> 29:36.760
about walking out on you
the way I did.

29:36.784 --> 29:38.753
And I figure, if we do this,

29:38.777 --> 29:41.977
I'd basically
be saving your life.

29:44.353 --> 29:46.363
I figure I owe you one.

29:48.487 --> 29:49.887
Karl...

29:52.421 --> 29:54.069
So what do you say?

29:54.093 --> 29:57.372
Will you marry me,
Susan Mayer?

29:57.396 --> 29:59.066
Again?

30:01.831 --> 30:03.909
What the hell?

30:03.933 --> 30:04.980
Cool!

30:13.012 --> 30:14.990
What are we gonna do about Edie?

30:15.014 --> 30:17.993
We can't tell her.
She'd kill us both.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.017
Yeah, it'll be
our little secret.

30:21.350 --> 30:23.328
We've really enjoyed
having you as a guest.

30:23.352 --> 30:24.329
Right, Gaby?

30:24.353 --> 30:26.231
Absolutely.

30:26.255 --> 30:29.074
Xiao-Mei,
you are a very special girl,

30:29.098 --> 30:32.228
so... So you take care, okay?

30:34.103 --> 30:35.103
Oh!

30:40.009 --> 30:42.117
Thanks for
all your help, Carlos.

30:42.141 --> 30:44.041
My pleasure, father.

30:47.977 --> 30:51.957
Bye-bye. Ladies?

30:51.981 --> 30:53.959
Please don't
tell me you're crying

30:53.983 --> 30:56.336
just because you can't
have the maid you want.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.833
Carlos, she wouldn't
have been just a maid.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.166
She would have been
the best damn maid ever.

31:01.190 --> 31:03.508
God, you're pathetic.

31:03.532 --> 31:04.870
Shut up.

31:07.271 --> 31:08.874
Hey, something's going on.

31:12.902 --> 31:15.881
Father crowley...

31:15.905 --> 31:18.353
Xiao-Mei, xiao-Mei...

31:18.377 --> 31:19.854
Is there a problem?

31:19.878 --> 31:22.587
Well, xiao-Mei doesn't want
to go back to China.

31:22.611 --> 31:24.890
She wants to stay here
and work for you.

31:24.914 --> 31:26.531
What? Why?

31:33.422 --> 31:36.509
She says Mrs. Solis
treated her with more kindness

31:36.533 --> 31:38.343
than she's ever known.

31:38.367 --> 31:41.106
She now thinks of you two
as family.

31:41.130 --> 31:43.578
Oh, really?

31:43.602 --> 31:46.582
Oh, of course you can stay!

31:48.577 --> 31:51.016
Oh!

31:51.040 --> 31:52.087
Gaby...

31:52.111 --> 31:56.021
Carlos,
she thinks of us as family.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.628
I'm ready to hear
those farm fresh concepts.

32:03.652 --> 32:05.000
Conference room in five...

32:05.024 --> 32:07.304
Toilet boy!

32:09.959 --> 32:12.637
You are so not allowed
to complain to me.

32:12.661 --> 32:15.010
I know. You were right, okay?
So now I'm known throughout

32:15.034 --> 32:17.017
the advertising world
as "toilet boy."

32:17.041 --> 32:19.384
Tell him you're done
with the games.

32:19.408 --> 32:21.386
You don't wanna play anymore.

32:21.410 --> 32:24.089
No, no, no, I can't.
I can't. If I back down now,

32:24.113 --> 32:25.996
he'll see it
as a sign of weakness.

32:26.020 --> 32:28.293
Look, this is the way that
guys do business. But...

32:28.317 --> 32:31.547
So you called it. He made me
his bitch. Come on.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.033
Here you go. Oh.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.035
You know, ed,
I've been thinking.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.537
We've had a lot of fun and games
around here lately,

32:42.561 --> 32:44.039
but maybe it's time

32:44.063 --> 32:46.680
to set a slightly more
professional tone in the office.

32:46.704 --> 32:48.173
Oh, I get it.

32:48.197 --> 32:50.215
Somebody went running
to mommy, didn't he? Huh?

32:50.239 --> 32:52.377
What? Tom loses a few bets,

32:52.401 --> 32:55.380
so he tries to get his wife
to make me back off?

32:55.404 --> 32:57.482
Oh, this issoalpha tau.

32:57.506 --> 33:00.055
I am gonna make him pay.

33:00.079 --> 33:03.989
No. No, you're not
gonna make him pay.

33:04.013 --> 33:05.730
You are gonna stop thisnow.

33:05.754 --> 33:07.392
This is my company.

33:07.416 --> 33:10.756
If people wanna work here,
they play by my rules.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.765
Ed! What?

33:19.628 --> 33:20.645
I'm calling you out.

33:20.669 --> 33:22.447
Huh? Yes, you're right.

33:22.471 --> 33:24.749
This is your company,
so I'll play by your rules.

33:24.773 --> 33:28.457
What do I have to do to get you
to stop this frat boy crap?

33:28.481 --> 33:30.415
Shave my eyebrows?
Come to work naked?

33:30.439 --> 33:32.117
Name your stakes.

33:32.141 --> 33:35.620
I don't have time for this. Aw,
what's wrong, ed?

33:35.644 --> 33:39.294
You afraid a phi kapp's
gonna get beaten by a girl?

33:39.318 --> 33:41.096
Come on, big man...

33:41.120 --> 33:43.120
It's just a little bet.

33:47.796 --> 33:51.236
As you know, I think
that making the workplace fun

33:51.260 --> 33:52.737
is good for morale.

33:52.761 --> 33:56.141
But Lynette here thinks
that our shenanigans

33:56.165 --> 33:57.382
have gotten
a little out of hand.

33:57.406 --> 34:00.085
Oh, hold on.

34:00.109 --> 34:02.587
Hold on. I respect
Lynette's work ethic.

34:02.611 --> 34:05.019
So we've decided
to settle the matter

34:05.043 --> 34:09.724
with a little test
of intestinal fortitude.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.058
If she can eat 1 pound

34:13.081 --> 34:18.063
of our client's fine,
farm-fresh pork product, raw...

34:20.389 --> 34:23.538
There'll be a moratorium
on wagering in the office.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.469
Oh, oh!

34:25.494 --> 34:27.281
I know
you are doing this for me.

34:27.304 --> 34:29.614
You don't need to do this.

34:29.638 --> 34:32.177
I don't need you fighting my
fights. I am not fighting your fights.

34:32.201 --> 34:34.179
This is my fight.

34:34.203 --> 34:36.186
This is how guys
do business, right?

34:36.210 --> 34:37.745
I gotta see this.

34:44.652 --> 34:46.731
This is so disgusting.

34:46.755 --> 34:48.554
We're counting on you.

34:51.159 --> 34:53.460
While we're young.

35:04.433 --> 35:07.282
No shame in defeat, Lynette.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.176
No shame at all.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.851
Oh, she's gonna do it.

35:29.298 --> 35:31.198
Ohh!

35:33.262 --> 35:35.262
Oh, yes!

35:38.367 --> 35:40.207
Oh!

35:50.449 --> 35:53.219
Oh, this is too much.

35:56.725 --> 35:58.463
Oh!

35:59.588 --> 36:04.439
What? She took the bet.

36:04.463 --> 36:07.643
What? This isfun, people.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.145
She's got one more.

36:31.490 --> 36:37.372
So... can this be a place
of business again, ed?

36:37.396 --> 36:39.244
No more games?

36:39.268 --> 36:40.268
Sure.

36:41.370 --> 36:43.870
You sucked all the fun
out of it anyway.

36:46.375 --> 36:48.383
Lynette...

36:48.407 --> 36:50.537
I gotta go back to work.

36:53.442 --> 36:57.492
Thatwas really something.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.894
Thanks.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.748
Could you scrounge me up
a bucket?

37:15.804 --> 37:17.791
Caleb said
a nice, red-haired lady

37:17.815 --> 37:19.284
came to visit him.

37:19.308 --> 37:20.968
Come on in, Betty.

37:25.514 --> 37:27.522
Get you a drink?

37:27.546 --> 37:29.524
This is not a social call, Bree!

37:29.548 --> 37:32.457
Did you or did you not break
into my home and talk to my son?

37:32.481 --> 37:35.960
Caleb and I had, uh,
a very lovely chat. Yes.

37:35.984 --> 37:38.241
If you ever
come near him again,

37:38.265 --> 37:40.305
there will be hell to pay.

37:40.329 --> 37:41.829
Do you understand?

37:43.892 --> 37:46.279
Aren't you gonna ask me
what we talked about?

37:46.303 --> 37:48.773
The name, um...

37:48.797 --> 37:51.397
Melanie foster came up.

37:54.343 --> 37:56.656
I'm gonna pour you
a drink now, Betty,

37:56.680 --> 37:59.724
because we're about to have
a very honest discussion,

37:59.748 --> 38:02.457
and I think you're gonna
need a little help

38:02.481 --> 38:04.351
getting through it.

38:07.456 --> 38:10.895
His name's Zach young.
He lives with his father.

38:10.919 --> 38:13.368
Mother committed suicide
about a year ago.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.440
How did he end up
with these people?

38:15.464 --> 38:16.941
How do you think?

38:16.965 --> 38:19.944
Dierdre was strung out, Noah.
She gave him up.

38:19.968 --> 38:22.447
I wanna see this boy.

38:22.471 --> 38:24.449
Well, he's got a new family now.

38:24.473 --> 38:26.456
I can't just snap my fingers
and get him in here.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.453
Maybe not,
but I can snap my fingers,

38:28.477 --> 38:31.316
and detective Sullivan can make
it happen. You don't wanna do that.

38:31.340 --> 38:34.319
No? Is that really the
way you wanna meet him...

38:34.343 --> 38:37.427
Have that thug drag him in here
so grandpa can give him a hug?

38:37.451 --> 38:40.325
Fine. You bring him.
I'll give you two days.

38:40.349 --> 38:43.349
As you know, I'm on a bit
of a clock here.

38:50.359 --> 38:51.936
When Caleb was born,

38:51.960 --> 38:56.080
and the doctors discovered
that he was different,

38:56.104 --> 38:57.774
I didn't even cry.

39:00.809 --> 39:05.920
It wasthemost painful moment
of my life.

39:05.944 --> 39:08.322
I didn't shed a single tear.

39:08.346 --> 39:12.026
I just thought to myself,
what's the point?

39:12.050 --> 39:18.963
He is my son, and I have
to raise him as best I can.

39:18.987 --> 39:21.127
Now that's my job.

39:22.591 --> 39:25.540
In a lot of ways,
I feel so blessed.

39:25.564 --> 39:31.015
Calebischallenged,
but he has such a sweet nature.

39:31.039 --> 39:34.379
I'm sure you noticed that
when you came to visit.

39:34.403 --> 39:36.043
Yes, I did.

39:37.746 --> 39:41.446
I also noticed that you had him
chained in the basement.

39:44.613 --> 39:46.993
That's because
of Melanie foster.

39:49.387 --> 39:54.469
Melanie was a girl
that Matthew dated.

39:54.493 --> 39:57.472
She was a debutante.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.644
And like typical teenagers,

39:59.668 --> 40:02.607
their relationship
was full of drama.

40:02.631 --> 40:05.410
They were always breaking up
and getting back together

40:05.434 --> 40:06.711
and breaking up.

40:06.735 --> 40:10.384
One night, after one
of their big blow-ups,

40:10.408 --> 40:12.487
Caleb somehow convinced Melanie

40:12.511 --> 40:15.460
to meet him down
at our local lumberyard.

40:15.484 --> 40:18.571
I can only imagine that
she thought he was bringing

40:18.595 --> 40:23.528
some kind of apology
from Matthew, but he wasn't.

40:23.552 --> 40:27.772
Caleb told Melanie
he was in love with her,

40:27.796 --> 40:30.905
and that
if he was her boyfriend,

40:30.929 --> 40:34.839
he would never
break up with her...

40:34.863 --> 40:37.542
And she laughed in his face.

40:37.566 --> 40:43.017
He tried to show her
he was serious by kissing her...

40:43.041 --> 40:46.441
And she hit him.

40:49.047 --> 40:52.026
He doesn't remember a lot
of what happened after that,

40:52.050 --> 40:56.731
but he... he does know that
he got very, very angry, and...

40:56.755 --> 41:00.125
And that there was an ax
lying on the ground nearby him.

41:04.593 --> 41:09.674
Yes, my Caleb killed Melanie,

41:09.698 --> 41:13.548
but I couldn't
let him go to jail...

41:13.572 --> 41:17.552
Or worse, be put down,

41:17.576 --> 41:20.685
for what was really my crime.

41:20.709 --> 41:22.579
Your crime?

41:25.584 --> 41:28.893
It was my responsibility.

41:28.917 --> 41:31.736
I was supposed
to protect him from himself.

41:31.760 --> 41:34.739
I am his mother.

41:34.763 --> 41:37.003
That was my job.

41:49.137 --> 41:55.019
The world is filled
with unlikely friendships.

41:55.043 --> 41:57.522
How do they begin?

41:57.546 --> 42:00.525
With one person
desperately in need,

42:00.549 --> 42:05.600
and another willing to lend
a helping hand.

42:05.624 --> 42:08.037
When such kindness is
offered... Whoo!

42:08.061 --> 42:10.174
We're finally able
to see the worth

42:10.198 --> 42:15.610
of those
we had previously written off.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.912
And before we know it...

42:17.936 --> 42:20.685
A bond has formed,

42:20.709 --> 42:25.890
regardless of whether others
can understand it.

42:25.914 --> 42:30.625
Yes, unlikely friendships
start up every day.

42:30.649 --> 42:33.057
No one understands this

42:33.081 --> 42:36.121
more than the lonely.

42:37.656 --> 42:39.533
In fact,

42:39.557 --> 42:41.557
it's what they count on.
