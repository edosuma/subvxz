take a look at this.

Professor, take a look.

42:32.634 --> 42:33.842
Hmm.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.929
This is obviously
alien writing.

42:39.140 --> 42:43.101
It says,
"Surrender or die,"

42:43.645 --> 42:47.439
and this is a list
of surrender terms.

Well, sort of.

It's the girl of my dreams,

Whoa! Hate's
a strong word.

43:15.009 --> 43:17.261
Maybe she just
dislikes you.

Plus, there's
another guy, Glar.

43:21.057 --> 43:22.849
Okay. You know
your problem?

43:22.934 --> 43:26.603
It's not Glar or Neera.
It's Lem.

You're so left-brain.

I have a technical question.

Are you considered
very ugly on this planet?

43:56.801 --> 43:58.593
What?
Because I can't tell.

43:58.678 --> 43:59.720
No.

Yes, and yes.

You're the one
with the right stuff.

56:32.389 --> 56:34.057
Get out of here.

56:37.102 --> 56:39.145
Finally! We've been
looking for you!

56:39.563 --> 56:40.772
Guys!

56:41.607 --> 56:44.400
Great hiding spot.
I call the closet.

56:44.485 --> 56:47.403
No way! Let's go
fight the army.

56:47.488 --> 56:48.988
How's your species
at hiding?

56:49.073 --> 56:51.032
Can you change your
skin to this color?

56:51.116 --> 56:55.161
Your call, Captain Baker.
What's it going to be,
fight or hide?

56:56.038 --> 56:57.330
Neither.

56:57.748 --> 56:59.665
I think Lem's saying
he wants the closet.

57:00.042 --> 57:01.709
I'll tell you what
it's going to be.

57:01.794 --> 57:04.337
We're gonna go get
Chuck back to his ship.

57:04.421 --> 57:06.422
Skiff, you were right
about Base 9.

57:06.507 --> 57:07.799
That's where
they have his ship.

57:07.883 --> 57:10.051
But we don't
know where it is.

57:10.135 --> 57:11.385
Yes, we do.

57:11.470 --> 57:15.723
Rover found me.
He's also programmed
to find my ship.

57:16.600 --> 57:17.725
Wait,
where is Rover?

57:18.352 --> 57:20.061
(SOBBING)

57:20.145 --> 57:22.355
It's too painful
to talk about.

57:23.190 --> 57:24.190
It's okay.

57:24.691 --> 57:26.442
They've got him at
the comic book shop.

57:27.027 --> 57:28.319
Well, then,
we've got to go
get him.

57:29.696 --> 57:32.490
Hold on.
The whole army's
looking for you two.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.450
You can't just
stroll through town.

57:36.703 --> 57:39.997
Wait, wait, that new movie,
doesn't that open tonight?
