WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:04.796
Previously on SEAL Team...

00:04.830 --> 00:06.388
JASON: It doesn't matter
what Nate wanted.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.362
I made the call.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.163
RAY:
Where's that blood coming from?
JULIE: The fact that you refuse

00:10.210 --> 00:12.576
to talk about Nate's death
is telling me

00:12.610 --> 00:14.771
that's exactly what we should be
talking about.

00:14.810 --> 00:17.074
Nate's death
isn't on you.
JULIE: I understand

00:17.110 --> 00:19.476
that since the operation
in December last year,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.215
you and your wife
have separated.

00:21.250 --> 00:22.615
RAY: You know he's sleeping
on our fold-out?

00:22.650 --> 00:24.789
ALANA: I miss seeing you guys.
It sucks that's

00:24.820 --> 00:27.482
the way it works.
And if any of us thought
there was even a chance

00:27.520 --> 00:28.680
you two weren't
gonna get past this,

00:28.720 --> 00:29.789
we'd all be taking it
pretty hard.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.252
Hey, Daddy.
Hi.

00:31.290 --> 00:32.257
ALANA:
It'd be great if you could

00:32.300 --> 00:33.392
come by one evening.

00:33.430 --> 00:34.522
Well, I don't live there
anymore,

00:34.560 --> 00:35.458
so it really doesn't matter,
right?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.058
I'm Clay.
Stella.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.294
When can I see you again?

00:38.330 --> 00:39.331
If you are what I think you are,

00:39.370 --> 00:40.564
you shouldn't have
too much trouble finding me.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.067
Until you graduate
Green Team,

00:42.110 --> 00:43.304
you're a member
of Chalk 2,

00:43.340 --> 00:44.762
Alpha Platoon,
SEAL Team 3.

00:44.810 --> 00:46.209
I'm telling you,
he's not ready.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.275
ADAM:
List in order the top five

00:47.310 --> 00:49.744
candidates of _this Selection
and Training class.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.600
On the other side,
list the bottom five.

00:51.650 --> 00:53.743
We'll post the bottom five
on the wall in the team room.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.715
Bottom man in the bottom five
will be immediately dropped

00:56.750 --> 00:59.082
from this Selection
and Training class.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.314
Is that clear, Mr. Spenser?

01:05.430 --> 01:08.490
* We come on the sloop John B *

01:08.530 --> 01:11.795
* My grandfather and me

01:11.830 --> 01:15.266
* Around Nassau town

01:15.300 --> 01:19.134
* We did roam

01:19.180 --> 01:22.149
* Drinking all night
(radio beeps)

01:22.180 --> 01:24.148
MAN (over radio):
Uh, Dr. Clark?

01:24.180 --> 01:26.341
* A fight

01:26.380 --> 01:28.575
I told you
never to call me here.

01:28.620 --> 01:30.349
And I told you
never to push your depth.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.846
You were close
to 40 meters.

01:31.890 --> 01:34.256
Which, if you remember,
is where we predicted

01:34.290 --> 01:36.383
we'd find the highest rate
of algae depletion.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.887
Next time just use the drone.

01:38.930 --> 01:42.127
I will, if I want
contaminated samples.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.489
You get the bends one time,
believe me,

01:43.530 --> 01:44.690
you won't want a second.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.231
You better stop right now,
Vince,

01:46.270 --> 01:48.363
or I'm gonna start to think
that you care about me.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.209
Believe me, it's not about you.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.128
It's the band deposit
I'm worried about.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.136
That and the cake.
You know, this feels
like a good moment

01:54.180 --> 01:56.444
to mention I never liked you.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.777
And yet you're marrying me.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.643
Speaking of which,
did you ask my...

02:00.680 --> 02:02.511
(automatic gunfire)
VINCE: Julia!

02:02.550 --> 02:03.585
(gunfire in distance)

02:04.690 --> 02:06.555
Vince.
(shouting in distance)

02:08.520 --> 02:10.750
(gunfire continues)
(men shouting
in foreign language)

02:38.650 --> 02:40.652
(radio drones indistinctly)

02:50.870 --> 02:53.395
(whistles softly)

02:59.940 --> 03:01.407
(chuckles)
Okay.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.203
Maybe we have
a different understanding

03:03.250 --> 03:05.548
of the word "ready" here.
(chuckles)
I'm basically ready.

03:05.580 --> 03:06.979
"Basically." No, you're not
basically ready.

03:07.020 --> 03:07.918
Let's go.
Chop, chop. All right?

03:07.950 --> 03:09.508
All right? And they say
that your generation

03:09.550 --> 03:12.314
has a different type
of work ethic?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.783
It's no_t_our_fault-- it's
the partICIpatlon trophies.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.788
Okay, seriously, Emma,
isn't "late for school,"

03:16.830 --> 03:17.979
like, a thing anymore?

03:18.030 --> 03:20.396
My homeroom teacher loves me.

03:20.430 --> 03:21.658
I'll be two seconds.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.521
I'm sure she'll love you even
more if you're on time, right?

03:24.570 --> 03:26.629
Come on.
Let's go, go, go.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.860
Hey.
I told you
you don't have to drive her.

03:31.910 --> 03:33.935
Come on. I'm
her dad, right?

03:33.980 --> 03:35.333
I like driving.

03:35.380 --> 03:38.008
Didn't hear the
doorbell just now.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.938
Used my keys.

03:39.980 --> 03:42.619
That's it. I'm
changing the locks.
Come on, really?

03:42.650 --> 03:44.743
It's not like I don't
breach doors for a living.

03:44.790 --> 03:45.984
I can get in.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.588
(hair dryer whining nearby)

03:49.630 --> 03:52.349
What's with
the toolbox there?

03:53.360 --> 03:54.554
Did you know?

03:54.600 --> 03:55.999
(chuckles)
Did I know what?

03:56.030 --> 03:57.361
I'm sorry, you have
to catch me up here.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.469
All right,
I started cleaning out

03:58.500 --> 03:59.467
Nate and Molly's garage
yesterday...

03:59.500 --> 04:01.468
I told you I was gonna
clean out the garage.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.367
Nate was hiding a burner phone.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.901
Uh, I think he was keeping it
in his toolbox.

04:06.940 --> 04:10.376
Nate was hiding a burner
phone from his wife.

04:10.410 --> 04:12.617
(chuckles)
Just to be clear here,

04:12.650 --> 04:15.448
you think because Nate had
a phone, he was cheating

04:15.480 --> 04:17.448
on Molly?
(Sighs)

04:17.490 --> 04:19.481
All I'm saying is
there's a lot of reasons

04:19.520 --> 04:21.283
why people use a phone.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.584
Not necessarily wh-what
you're saying.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.484
All right, so was he?

04:25.530 --> 04:27.953
I don't know.
Was he what, having an affair?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.888
Well, what do
you think?

04:29.930 --> 04:32.535
You were
his friend.
(sighs)

04:36.540 --> 04:39.509
Oh, right. I'm sorry, you can't.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.838
'Cause-â€˜cause
I'm just Wives' Club, right?

04:41.880 --> 04:43.905
It's you and the boys.
You wouldn't tell me

04:43.950 --> 04:45.838
even if you knew.
I'm not doing this right now.

04:45.880 --> 04:49.270
Emma, come on!
There was a time you would
have told me, you know?

04:52.090 --> 04:53.512
I looked at
the history.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.585
All the calls are to
and from one number.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.528
Did you call it?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.755
Disconnected.
Okay, look,
I'll take care of this.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.665
Easy. I'll take care of this,
all right?

05:03.700 --> 05:04.689
Just don't say anything,
'cause I don't want anything

05:04.730 --> 05:06.698
getting back to Molly,
all right?
Trust me,

05:06.740 --> 05:09.334
I'm not looking to talk about
this, especially with Molly.

05:09.370 --> 05:11.406
EMMA: Not looking
to talk about what?

05:11.440 --> 05:12.577
Grown-up stuff?

05:12.610 --> 05:14.532
Grown-up stuff.
Exactly, huh?

05:14.580 --> 05:16.400
Talking about grown-up stuff.
Come on, let's go.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.543
We'll talk about it in the car,
'cause you are late.

05:18.580 --> 05:20.639
I got to get you going.
A lot of grown-up stuff.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.740
Too much grown-up stuff.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.579
Step out, I got it.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.052
I got this, Clay.
No, I'm good.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.692
Swap with Jonesy, he needs
a break, let's go. Come on!

05:34.730 --> 05:36.027
JASON: Swap with Jonesy
because he needs a break.

05:36.060 --> 05:37.561
You got to be
kidding me, right?

05:37.600 --> 05:38.862
Hey, look, man, you can't
deny the kid's talent.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.390
Or his ego.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.408
His ego 'cause he's
refusing to check out.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.465
Yeah, to prevent his
teammates from puking.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.738
No, I think he's
overcompensating

05:45.770 --> 05:46.429
because he's hit
the bottom five.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.731
That's why.
You know what?

05:47.780 --> 05:48.838
He keeps pressing
the red like that,

05:48.880 --> 05:50.108
you know what
he's gonna do?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.105
He's gonna hit a wall,
he's gonna slow

05:51.150 --> 05:52.105
his whole team down.

05:52.150 --> 05:53.640
You sure you're not
threatened

05:53.680 --> 05:54.612
'cause he's faster than you?
Threatened? (scoffs)

05:54.650 --> 05:56.584
You gotta be kidding me.
Triple my rucksack,

05:56.620 --> 05:59.453
and I'll still beat his ass
up that hill, Ray.

05:59.490 --> 06:00.752
What was that you were
just saying about ego?

06:00.790 --> 06:02.155
Nothing.
Jason Hayes,

06:02.190 --> 06:04.158
you said something
about ego a second ago.

06:04.190 --> 06:05.384
JASON:
Come on, Ray-dawg.

06:12.970 --> 06:16.428
Come on, let's go.
No slack, boys, let's go!

06:21.580 --> 06:23.502
You missed your
exfil window

06:23.550 --> 06:25.108
_ and are now
In enemy hands.

06:25.150 --> 06:26.674
Congratulations,

06:26.720 --> 06:29.143
you've won the chance
to run it again.

06:31.690 --> 06:34.158
You know, Mr. Spenser,
there's such a thing

06:34.190 --> 06:35.680
as being too unselfish.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.156
Team's only as fast
as its slowest guy.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.435
(jets flying over)

06:50.770 --> 06:53.705
The Centaurus, a U.S.-f|agged
research vessel

06:53.740 --> 06:56.447
doing oxygen-level surveys
in the South China Sea.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.072
We think it was
hijacked this morning.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.816
Wait a second, you think?

06:59.850 --> 07:01.545
What do you mean,
you don't know?
Well, whoever took it

07:01.580 --> 07:02.808
hasn't made contact yet.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.818
How do we know
anyone took It?

07:08.860 --> 07:09.724
(on speaker):
This is Dr. Vincent Barbour,

07:09.760 --> 07:12.081
aboard the research vessel
Centaurus.

07:12.130 --> 07:13.757
We're approximately 100 miles
off the coast of Iloilo.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.552
We're being overtaken by what
appears to be a gang of...

07:15.600 --> 07:17.795
Oh, God! No, no, no, no!
(automatic gunfire)

07:17.830 --> 07:19.639
No, please, no!
(cries out)

07:19.670 --> 07:22.639
What do you want?
(indistinct shouting)

07:22.670 --> 07:25.833
BARBOUR:
What do you want? Who are you?

07:25.870 --> 07:28.009
(static)

07:28.040 --> 07:29.803
(gunfire, screaming)

07:37.090 --> 07:38.182
Dr. Vincent Barbour, professor
of Ocean and Climate Science

07:38.220 --> 07:41.087
at Stanford.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.054
We believe it's his voice
on the sat recording.

07:43.090 --> 07:45.786
Dr. Julia Clark,
also from Stanford.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.718
These two are due
to get married next month.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.625
DAVIS: There's more
photos on your laptops,

07:49.670 --> 07:51.797
plus full bios
for the scientists.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.092
They don't ask crew
members to post bios

07:53.140 --> 07:55.267
on the faculty Web site.
You know that's right.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.700
DAVIS:
Mm-hmm.
You two best watch

07:57.740 --> 07:59.264
the "exploitation
of the working man" talk.

07:59.310 --> 08:01.107
People might get the idea
you've gone commie.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.973
DAVIS: Oh, please.
What_the hell'd
you just say?

08:04.010 --> 08:07.013
So that's the hostages,
and now we come

08:07.050 --> 08:08.244
to the hostage-takers,
and for that,

08:08.280 --> 08:09.986
this is my colleague,
Sam Roberts.

08:10.020 --> 08:13.615
Sam's the Agency's top analyst
on Southeast Asian piracy.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.059
Wow, you got more
than one expert

08:15.090 --> 08:16.887
on Southeast Asia piracy.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.797
Okay.
No offense, bud.
None taken.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.991
SAM:
Uh, actually, although

08:22.030 --> 08:24.260
_ the Horn of Africa _
still gets the most attention,

08:24.300 --> 08:25.961
the waters of Southeast Asia
have become

08:26.000 --> 08:27.069
the most dangerous
in the world.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.897
Now, the good news
for us is that,

08:28.940 --> 08:32.137
unlike the Horn, the region
surrounding this area

08:32.170 --> 08:33.808
is relatively stable.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.205
There's just not a lot
of harbors for pirates

08:35.240 --> 08:37.572
to hole up in
and negotiate ransom.

08:37.610 --> 08:39.976
Most of the local pros
use the Anambas Islands.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.682
Centaurus's GPS shows her
400 miles east

08:42.720 --> 08:44.938
of Vietnam, headed
south-southwest.

08:44.990 --> 08:46.548
Puts her in the Anambas
day after tomorrow.

08:46.590 --> 08:47.989
Okay, that's great.
How long till we're greenlit?

08:48.020 --> 08:49.829
Working on it now.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.555
Apparently, they're having
one of those office

08:51.590 --> 08:54.127
politics situations
up at CentCom.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.867
A couple "two stars" trying
to show who's got more juice.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.299
You're kidding me, right?
I wish.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.592
War on terror.
War on terror, yeah.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.062
We should be airborne
right now.

09:06.210 --> 09:08.201
(pop music playing
in background)

09:10.250 --> 09:14.846
* Snatch me up to your side...

09:14.880 --> 09:17.019
Ah... all right.

09:17.050 --> 09:19.041
Mm...

09:22.320 --> 09:24.151
You know what they call
a guy who graduates last

09:24.190 --> 09:26.021
in his med school class?

09:26.060 --> 09:28.096
Why's it got to be a guy?

09:28.130 --> 09:30.166
Is that how you chatted up
Miss Gender Studies?

09:30.200 --> 09:31.224
You "white knight" it?

09:33.200 --> 09:34.792
She's studying literature.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.193
She's here, you know.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.060
(clears throat)
Yep.

09:40.310 --> 09:42.039
They call him "Doctor."

09:42.080 --> 09:44.901
Him or her.
Hmm.

09:44.950 --> 09:47.043
Thank you.
Mm.

09:49.050 --> 09:50.881
Come on, man, you got
to shake this off.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.785
You got to shake it off.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.219
You're still here,
all right?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.284
Make it through Selection,

09:55.320 --> 09:56.981
get drafted to
a Tier One squadron.

09:57.030 --> 09:57.985
It doesn't matter
how many times

09:58.030 --> 09:59.054
you got bottom-fived.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.325
(clears throat)
Look, most of the guys

10:03.370 --> 10:05.895
in_our Selection class
just put my name

10:05.930 --> 10:07.898
on a list of guys that they
think don't belong here.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.032
I'm supposed to
just get past that

10:09.070 --> 10:10.162
and just go back
to operating next to them?

10:10.210 --> 10:12.929
Means I know you want to blame
that vote on jealousy.

10:12.980 --> 10:13.901
Guys putting you
in the bottom five

10:13.940 --> 10:14.702
because your daddy
wrote a book, or 'cause

10:14.740 --> 10:16.071
you're faster
than a damn rabbit

10:16.110 --> 10:17.042
through the shoot house.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.298
Yeah, damn right I am.
Yeah, you are, man.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.875
But maybe you might want
to consider the possibility

10:21.920 --> 10:23.410
that nobody is trying
to punish you.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.111
That guys only listed you
'cause of the way

10:25.150 --> 10:27.050
you've been acting since
the second we got here.

10:27.090 --> 10:28.853
How have I been acting?

10:29.990 --> 10:33.027
You know, all the years that
we were together at Team 3,

10:33.060 --> 10:36.154
you are the only guy
that I was 100% certain

10:36.200 --> 10:38.896
was gonna be a Tier 1
operator one day.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.158
The only guy.

10:43.110 --> 10:46.261
Not a SEAL alive wouldn't want
to operate next to that guy.

10:46.310 --> 10:48.631
I'd be interested to know
what happened to him.

10:58.350 --> 10:59.317
STELLA:
Hello, sailor.

10:59.350 --> 11:01.159
Sailor, huh?

11:01.190 --> 11:03.886
That's funny.
Thank you.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.251
Thought of it
all by myself.

11:06.290 --> 11:09.896
Got tired of waiting for
you to come over there.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.023
Got tired of waiting
for you to call, too.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.368
I guess you really are not
Dog the Bounty Hunter.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.163
No. No, I tried to tell you.

11:16.200 --> 11:20.000
But you are a SEAL,
though, right?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.871
Or is that something
you're not allowed to admit?

11:21.910 --> 11:23.070
No, it's allowed.

11:23.110 --> 11:26.307
Groow.

11:28.950 --> 11:32.249
So, are you a-a...
a color or a number?

11:32.290 --> 11:34.918
I'm sorry?

11:34.960 --> 11:37.451
Just something that I
heard some frog hogs say.

11:37.490 --> 11:39.424
You're familiar
with frog hogs?

11:39.460 --> 11:41.758
You're familiar with frog hogs?

11:41.800 --> 11:44.360
Uh, yeah, around here,
you can't avoid them.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.095
So why come here then?

11:46.130 --> 11:49.133
(laughing):
What do you mean?

11:49.170 --> 11:51.365
Uh, I mean, you're from...
you're from Hudson State.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.935
That's up north, right,
near-near Williamsburg?

11:53.980 --> 11:55.038
So?

11:55.080 --> 11:57.799
Well, so, I mean, there must be
bars in Williamsburg.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.216
There's one a few blocks
from my apartment.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.889
Hmm. Never occurred to you

12:02.920 --> 12:04.785
to maybe just
do your drinking there?

12:04.820 --> 12:07.516
I mean, you wouldn't
even need a designated driver.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.984
(laughs)

12:11.030 --> 12:13.328
You know, a suspicious
mind might think

12:13.360 --> 12:15.294
that you're implying
that I'm a frog hog.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.469
No, I know what you are.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.163
An intelligent and
charming individual

12:21.200 --> 12:24.237
who transcends any attempt
at lazy generalization?

12:24.270 --> 12:26.238
No, you're a tourist.

12:26.270 --> 12:29.205
No, you're just looking
for a little adventure

12:29.240 --> 12:31.970
before you settle down
in your ivory-tower life.

12:32.010 --> 12:35.116
You know, some stories to tell
the kids from your seminar.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.516
Let 'em know
you were the cool professor.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.354
Wow. Okay, that's, um...

12:42.390 --> 12:45.484
that's a really terrible thing
to say.

12:45.530 --> 12:48.499
And to think I came over here
hoping to have some fun.

12:48.530 --> 12:50.395
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint.

12:50.430 --> 12:53.035
Oh, no, no, no, you did
not disappoint me, Clay.

12:53.070 --> 12:55.231
You just stopped
surprising me.

12:58.270 --> 13:00.079
BRIAN: Oh, I guess
we decided

13:00.110 --> 13:01.930
to go the other way
on the whole white-knight thing.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.217
Warships, I can see, but yachts?

13:07.250 --> 13:09.946
Yeah, who wants to build
a model of a research vessel?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.309
Bunch of nerds.
Not me.

13:11.350 --> 13:13.113
Good news is, you can buy 'em
already assembled

13:13.160 --> 13:14.809
if you want
to pay a little extra.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.157
Isn't it your
patriotic duty

13:16.190 --> 13:17.327
to build it there, Davis,
you know,

13:17.360 --> 13:19.180
save Uncle
Sam some cash?

13:19.230 --> 13:20.959
Sonny, you do realize
it's my job

13:21.000 --> 13:22.228
to pack your parachutes,
right?
Ooh!

13:22.260 --> 13:24.820
Is she allowed
to joke about that?

13:24.870 --> 13:27.191
Probably not.
Well, you gonna write her up?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.935
Well, no. She packs
my chutes, too.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.131
Come on, you got
to give her props, man.

13:31.170 --> 13:32.979
At least she's got the manners
not to bring up your dive gear.

13:33.010 --> 13:34.170
I'm not evil.

13:34.210 --> 13:35.871
RAY:
You ever think of
how dumb it is

13:35.910 --> 13:37.468
to join the Naw
when you're afraid of the water?

13:37.510 --> 13:39.307
Pretty interesting. I think
someone's afraid to swim.

13:39.350 --> 13:41.409
I'm not afraid to swim, okay?

13:41.450 --> 13:44.214
It's just not
my first choice.
Okay.

13:44.250 --> 13:47.413
Now, if I was a
dirt bag, I'd hide

13:47.460 --> 13:50.020
the passengers
right in here.

13:50.060 --> 13:53.951
Why?
No windows, good egress point
to move the hostages quickly.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.297
And defendable,
in case they get boarded.

13:55.330 --> 13:56.866
Yeah, but where
are the bathrooms?

13:56.900 --> 13:58.197
Mm-hmm.
The worst thing
about being

13:58.230 --> 13:59.424
a hostage-taker's got
to be the hostages.

13:59.470 --> 14:01.267
I mean, they need food, water,
bathroom breaks.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.109
JASON:
She got a good point.
I mean, you keep 'em there,

14:03.140 --> 14:04.334
you're gonna be
spending all your time

14:04.370 --> 14:05.928
taking them to and
back from the head.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.130
So how do you want
to board this?

14:07.180 --> 14:10.240
Wait till the boat
makes harbor, dive in.
Combat swim op.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.508
Old school
frogman style.
There you go.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.040
I don't suppose I could interest

14:13.080 --> 14:15.241
any of you
in an under-way boarding?

14:15.280 --> 14:16.884
I mean, we got
the helo pad right here.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.241
We chopper in, surprise
'em while they're sleeping.

14:19.290 --> 14:21.451
That'd be great if we knew
the location of the hostages.
I know that.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.583
It's just...
Come on, get
excited, brother.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.619
Going swimming in it.
Get excited.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.252
It's happening.
We're doing it.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.291
Fine. We'll swim in.

14:27.330 --> 14:29.218
All right,
guys, look,

14:29.260 --> 14:31.069
assuming the boat's
docked bow-in,

14:31.100 --> 14:32.362
our hook-point
should be at the stern.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.436
It'll be less likely
to have hostiles back there.

14:34.470 --> 14:36.631
Plus, it's got
nice shielding from the shore.

14:36.670 --> 14:38.262
This helo pad's
gonna provide

14:38.310 --> 14:39.902
great concealment
from the bridge.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.237
Keep in mind this
thing's been at sea
for a few weeks,

14:41.280 --> 14:42.907
so the deck's gonna be
a slip-and-slide.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.349
Gonna have _
to watch your footing.

14:44.380 --> 14:45.608
Slow is smooth
and smooth is fast.

14:45.650 --> 14:47.311
Yeah, it is.

14:47.350 --> 14:49.011
We figure two assault teams
with sniper overwatch?

14:49.050 --> 14:51.314
Alpha Team gets set
to hit the bridge while we

14:51.350 --> 14:53.113
find out where the
hostages are being held.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.650
Then we coordinate over comms,
simultaneous assault.

14:54.690 --> 14:55.918
Take out the bad guys
on the bridge

14:55.960 --> 14:57.120
before they can
call the cavalry.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.628
Take out the guards before
they start smoking the hostages.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.220
Bam.
Gonna need...
Draegers, nav boards,

15:02.260 --> 15:03.397
painters' poles, hooks.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.660
She's on it.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.331
Doesn't bother you
that the only reason why

15:09.370 --> 15:11.235
we're sitting here
on our asses,

15:11.270 --> 15:13.374
instead of in a C-17 on our
way to the... "La Bambas"

15:13.410 --> 15:16.004
to start setting up our welcome
for Captain Jack Sparrow

15:16.040 --> 15:18.372
and his merry men is because
of a pair of two-star generals

15:18.410 --> 15:20.344
who are having some type of
bureaucratic power struggle?

15:20.380 --> 15:22.018
Pretty sure
one of them was an admiral.

15:22.050 --> 15:25.087
Okay, of course,
it bothers me, Ray.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.179
You did that whole, uh, new

15:27.220 --> 15:29.381
NSA surveillance thing
last year in D.C., right?

15:29.420 --> 15:31.081
Ugh. Yeah. Those
guys are terrifying.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.654
Made me scared to walk past
my computer.
Right.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.658
They teach you how to track
phones and stuff like that?

15:34.700 --> 15:37.498
(laughing):
Look, man, I know things are
weird between you guys

15:37.530 --> 15:40.431
right now, but stalking your
wife's a rabbit hole, trust me.

15:40.470 --> 15:43.064
(laughing):
No. It's Nate.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.237
Well, Nate-- him, you
definitely don't need to track.

15:45.270 --> 15:47.374
From my understanding,
he's gonna stay put a while,

15:47.410 --> 15:48.729
like End of Times.

15:48.780 --> 15:51.408
Oh, Nate was hiding a burner
phone in his toolbox, okay?

15:51.450 --> 15:53.748
Alana found it when she was
cleaning out their garage.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.441
Oh, she thinks
it's a ho phone.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.617
What else is it gonna be?

15:56.650 --> 15:58.242
Maybe he was talking
to a reporter,

15:58.290 --> 16:00.053
like, Deep-Throat style?

16:00.090 --> 16:01.614
Partying with
Lee Harvey Oswald

16:01.660 --> 16:05.448
and the breakdancing kid
from that Pepsi ad, right?

16:05.490 --> 16:09.358
What do you care if Nate
was stepping out anyway?

16:09.400 --> 16:11.288
It's Alana, okay?

16:11.330 --> 16:13.332
You think that if it
turns out they were a lie,

16:13.370 --> 16:16.134
she's that much less likely
to give you two another shot?

16:18.270 --> 16:19.601
Look, man, nobody wants

16:19.640 --> 16:21.608
to see you back with
Alana more than I do,

16:21.640 --> 16:23.471
get your ass back home

16:23.510 --> 16:26.479
instead of lounging around
my living room all day,

16:26.510 --> 16:29.445
but Nate's phone's not
gonna get you there.

16:29.480 --> 16:34.315
Besides, NSA wants to track you,
they go straight to your nav.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.056
The nav in Nate's car?

16:37.090 --> 16:38.728
Yeah, it's like riding
around in a digital snitch.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.252
What you're saying is
that the nav in Nate's car

16:42.300 --> 16:45.019
has got a record
of everywhere he's been?

16:45.070 --> 16:46.662
No.
That's not what
you're saying?

16:46.700 --> 16:49.430
No, no, I'm saying it's
the Lord's car now, man.
I...

16:49.470 --> 16:52.030
Molly donated it
to their church.
I know. I'm driving. Come on.

16:52.070 --> 16:53.378
Jason.
Let's go. Come on.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.071
WOMAN:
Let's make sure

16:55.110 --> 16:56.577
I have this right.
Something of yours was left

16:59.580 --> 17:03.448
and I can't call the donor
to have her vouch for you?

17:03.490 --> 17:06.118
And I can't go looking
for the item myself

17:06.150 --> 17:09.153
'cause you can't tell me
what it is?

17:09.190 --> 17:10.418
Yes, ma'am, exactly.
See, it's a personal...

17:10.460 --> 17:13.395
"Of a personal
nature." I heard you.

17:13.430 --> 17:15.648
Son, is there pornography
in that car?

17:15.700 --> 17:18.419
No, ma'am, there's no
pornography in the car.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.791
You know what they say
about a man that lets his tongue

17:20.840 --> 17:23.308
drip falsehoods
in the house of the Lord?

17:23.340 --> 17:27.538
"He that worketh deceit
shall not dwell in my house,

17:27.580 --> 17:29.138
nor tarry in my sight."

17:29.180 --> 17:30.841
You know your Psalms.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.847
Yes, ma'am, I do.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.438
You do.
I do, yeah.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.368
Listen, Nancy,
we give you our word,

17:35.420 --> 17:37.149
there's no pornography
in the car.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.488
There's no
pornography.
No.

17:44.590 --> 17:46.455
Thanks, Nancy.

17:46.490 --> 17:48.856
Don't make me come
looking for you.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.528
Not in this heat.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.297
Thank you, Miss Nancy.

17:56.340 --> 17:58.661
Mm-hmm.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.702
Find a date
with multiple calls.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.345
May 1-- five calls.

18:08.550 --> 18:10.541
(beeping)

18:13.820 --> 18:16.254
What's in Norfolk?

18:16.290 --> 18:17.518
Not much, if memory serves.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.529
Pick another date
with multiple calls.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.448
April 24--
four calls.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.421
It's Norfolk again.

18:25.470 --> 18:27.438
It's the same address.

18:27.470 --> 18:29.290
That's it.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.433
What do you mean
it disappeared?

18:35.480 --> 18:37.402
I mean, one second,
I'm looking right at it.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.769
The next, it's just...
What disappeared?

18:38.810 --> 18:41.813
The Centauru We were tracking
it to the Anambas Islands.

18:41.850 --> 18:43.488
Its GPS just turned off.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.511
Oh, my God.

18:53.660 --> 18:56.788
(beeping)

19:08.540 --> 19:10.440
Looks like the pirates
have finally figured out

19:10.480 --> 19:12.869
how to disable
the Centaurus's GPS.

19:12.910 --> 19:14.741
Last known position was here.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.715
By now, they could be
anywhere within this circle.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.355
And by the time
we get you over there...

19:20.390 --> 19:21.652
JASON:
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.578
How big is that area?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.552
About the size of
the continental United States,

19:25.590 --> 19:27.251
give or take Ohio.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.207
MANDY:
We need to figure out
where they're going.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.605
If they were headed
to the Anambas,

19:39.640 --> 19:40.732
why weren't they bearing west

19:40.780 --> 19:42.475
before the GPS
went offline?

19:42.510 --> 19:44.649
Trying to throw us off
maybe?

19:44.680 --> 19:47.376
Typhoon season intensifies
the currents, yeah?

19:47.420 --> 19:49.217
Considerably.
All right.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.787
Well, wouldn't you expect
any halfway competent captain

19:51.820 --> 19:53.708
to avoid heading directly into

19:53.760 --> 19:55.557
a strong current?

19:55.590 --> 19:58.753
Lieutenant Commander Blackburn,
as a Navy man?

19:58.790 --> 20:00.394
If he's trying to
save fuel, sure.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.694
SAM: Well, pirate captain may
not be interested in that.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.869
Plus, most of them
aren't too competent.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.698
Well, this one was competent
enough to switch off his GPS.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.230
These guys likely
know the waters.

20:09.270 --> 20:11.363
They're in a hurry
to find some shade.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.729
Can we plot what their
trajectory would look like

20:12.770 --> 20:15.603
if they were maximizing
their use of currents?

20:19.950 --> 20:21.872
Philippines.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.444
What I'm thinking.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.918
(speaks Filipino)

20:44.970 --> 20:46.631
Ready, ready.

20:46.670 --> 20:47.773
Burning.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.626
(grunts)

21:09.060 --> 21:10.368
Grenade!

21:12.070 --> 21:14.038
ADAM:
Hold there.

21:14.070 --> 21:16.698
Role-players, out.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.378
Come on, let's go.

21:20.410 --> 21:22.731
Some real Chuck Norris action,
Spensen

21:22.780 --> 21:24.907
Dive on the grenade.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.906
Make a great chapter
in your book.

21:26.950 --> 21:29.475
Problem is,
unlike your daddy,

21:29.520 --> 21:32.944
you're too dead
to write one.

21:32.990 --> 21:34.582
Want to tell us what
the hell you're thinking?

21:36.820 --> 21:39.527
I was thinking I need to save
a hostage and my teammate.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.927
Spenser, this isn't Guadalcanal.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.393
Your mission, for which
the American taxpayer

21:46.430 --> 21:47.829
is sending you
across the world,

21:47.870 --> 21:50.031
is to get the hostage
to safety,

21:50.070 --> 21:52.402
not go medal jumping.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.579
Grenade goes live,
you get low,

21:54.610 --> 21:55.907
out of the blast range,

21:55.940 --> 21:57.840
hope your armor catches
most of the flak.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.541
At least that way you're
giving yourself a chance

21:59.580 --> 22:01.639
instead of dry humping
that explosive

22:01.680 --> 22:02.977
all the way to the afterlife.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.781
Are we clear?

22:07.820 --> 22:09.788
Are we clear?!

22:09.820 --> 22:10.957
Clear.
Clear.

22:10.990 --> 22:12.526
Good.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.391
Run it again.

22:14.430 --> 22:17.092
(jet engine roaring)

22:17.130 --> 22:18.927
According to my source
in Mindanao,

22:18.970 --> 22:21.495
the Centaur is headed for the
Philippines. Iligan City.

22:21.540 --> 22:22.962
Don't you mean
"Iligan's Island"?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.968
Iligan City has been
the flash point

22:25.010 --> 22:27.478
for a long-running
terror campaign.

22:27.510 --> 22:28.977
My source hears
that they're headed there

22:29.010 --> 22:30.602
to meet a buyer
for the hostages.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.538
Your source know
who the buyer is?

22:32.580 --> 22:34.673
Yeah. Thurston Howell III.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.948
Eduardo Mercado.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.086
We believe his organization
is responsible

22:39.120 --> 22:41.088
for the ferry bombing last month
killed 70 people.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.849
Mercado's been looking for
a way to announce himself

22:42.890 --> 22:44.619
as a player on
the world stage.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.389
Figures he'll buy some
American hostages,

22:46.430 --> 22:48.398
cut their heads off
on the Internet.

22:48.430 --> 22:50.091
Cheap way to get publicity, huh?

22:50.130 --> 22:51.859
All right, brother Ray.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.663
You want to tell
everybody again

22:53.700 --> 22:55.395
how we're gonna get
these people home safe?

22:55.440 --> 22:56.964
We hit the boat
as soon as it docks.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.104
Once we secure the hostages,
we call for the fast boats,

22:59.140 --> 23:01.870
exfil before anybody in port
knows we were there.
Petty Officer Davis,

23:01.910 --> 23:03.798
you do realize that
we will be swimming

23:03.850 --> 23:05.477
in some of the
migratory routes

23:05.510 --> 23:07.410
of some of the world's
deadliest sharks.

23:07.450 --> 23:10.112
Yes, indeed. Yes. These
are the very same waters

23:10.150 --> 23:12.880
where the USS Indianapolis
sank in 1945.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.582
Hundreds of American _
crewmen survwed the Sinking

23:15.620 --> 23:18.623
only to end up, sadly,
eaten by sharks.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.821
RAY: Well, you have to assume
that those sharks passed down

23:20.860 --> 23:23.192
their love of sailor flesh to
their shark grandbabies, yeah?

23:23.230 --> 23:24.595
Gotta assume.
RAY: Gotta assume.

23:24.630 --> 23:26.598
I've been punched,
shot and stabbed.

23:26.630 --> 23:29.133
Got frag in my shoulder twice,
an RPG almost geld me.

23:29.170 --> 23:31.968
You think I'm afraid
of some stupid-ass fish?

23:32.010 --> 23:33.477
DAVIS: Uh, yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

23:33.510 --> 23:34.829
Absolutely.
Uh-huh.
We all do.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.677
Unbelievable.

23:36.710 --> 23:38.701
(imitates chomping)

23:43.180 --> 23:45.011
(clears throat)

23:45.050 --> 23:46.642
Did you pack it?

23:51.890 --> 23:54.051
Is this the "it"
that you're referring to?

23:54.100 --> 23:55.590
Oh, yes.

23:55.630 --> 23:57.461
So these teeny, tiny magnets

23:57.500 --> 23:59.821
are supposed to protect you
from a 2,000 pound shark?
Mm-hmm.

23:59.870 --> 24:01.531
The ad says it's a
proven deterrent.

24:01.570 --> 24:03.128
Okay.

24:03.170 --> 24:05.229
SONNY:
Officer's Training School?

24:05.270 --> 24:07.579
What the hell's
this about?
Oh, nothing.

24:07.610 --> 24:09.874
My friend, Gina, from Admin
was asking, so I thought

24:09.910 --> 24:12.003
I'd do a little
investigation for her.

24:12.050 --> 24:13.074
Oh, you ain't a
good friend if you're

24:13.110 --> 24:14.668
helping her become
a cake-eater.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.518
Officers are a bunch of
do-nothing politicians

24:17.550 --> 24:20.519
whose only purpose is dreaming
up new ways to get us killed.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.710
And that is precisely
what I told her.

24:22.760 --> 24:23.749
Good. And by the way,

24:23.790 --> 24:25.553
this bracelet is not bogus.

24:25.590 --> 24:28.127
Aquaman's trident has nothing
on this thing.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.463
(grunts, laughs)

24:34.070 --> 24:35.162
I got to say
something, brother.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.168
What's that?

24:37.200 --> 24:39.532
It doesn't seem right poking
around Nate's life like this.

24:39.570 --> 24:41.572
Man's got a right to be buried
with his secrets.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.032
All right? Just forget
we ever found

24:43.080 --> 24:44.547
that address
inside the truck.

24:44.580 --> 24:46.775
Tell Alana that
the phone was a dead-end.

24:46.810 --> 24:48.243
You can see it as lying,

24:48.280 --> 24:50.942
or you can see it as...

24:50.990 --> 24:52.912
easing her burden.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.085
What good's telling her
gonna do?

25:05.070 --> 25:06.697
_I count four
pirates on deck.

25:06.730 --> 25:09.198
Any sign of the buyers?
Nothing.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.538
Any luck, we'll get on
board before they arrive.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.834
How long till we're there?

25:13.880 --> 25:15.029
Based on the current,
we calculated

25:15.080 --> 25:17.036
a 45 to 50 minute swim
from the launch point

25:17.080 --> 25:20.106
to the Centaurus and they've
been under 40 minutes almost.

25:20.150 --> 25:21.879
All right.
I'm gonna update command.

25:23.890 --> 25:27.678
Hey, um, I just want
to tell you that was smart.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.756
You know, figuring out
an alternate destination

25:29.790 --> 25:31.655
for the boat, contacting
your people on the ground,

25:31.690 --> 25:33.282
that was resourceful.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.150
All this time around you
must be rubbing off on me.

25:38.270 --> 25:41.296
I see three vehicles
pulling up.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.591
Got to be our buyer.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.200
Eyes on four men,
all armed.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.777
Well, four on deck, that
makes eight hostiles.

25:47.810 --> 25:50.278
MANDY:
No, no, no. Oh, my God.

25:50.310 --> 25:51.846
Who the hell are those guys?

25:51.880 --> 25:54.041
Brave 1, this is TOC.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.116
Abort infil.
Repeat, abort infil.
They're under.

25:56.150 --> 25:57.788
Their comms aren't gonna work
until they resurface.

26:03.260 --> 26:05.581
At which time they'll
be facing an army.

26:20.140 --> 26:22.131
*

26:42.030 --> 26:44.021

26:47.430 --> 26:49.637
(muffled talking)

27:08.320 --> 27:10.311
*

27:38.190 --> 27:39.282
All right, looks
like the party

27:39.320 --> 27:40.241
got a lot bigger
than expected, huh?

27:40.290 --> 27:42.315
That's what happens
when people don't RSVP.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.453
How long until
we reestablish comms?

27:44.490 --> 27:45.787
At least a few minutes.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.183
Our situation has changed.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.458
Can't get
to the hostages unseen.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.421
Gonna have to do this
quick and dirty.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.963
My two favorite words:
"quick" and "dirty."

28:02.480 --> 28:04.448
On you, Ray.

28:20.130 --> 28:22.951
*

28:28.400 --> 28:30.391
(indistinct talking nearby)

28:35.980 --> 28:38.346
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is TOC.

28:38.380 --> 28:41.076
Be advised, multiple hostiles
have boarded the Centaurus.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.212
Yeah, we got that.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.241
Moved infil to starboard side.

28:44.290 --> 28:47.248
Bravo 1, we got 12 hostiles
on deck.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.814
Any visual on the hostages?

28:48.860 --> 28:49.679
None topside,

28:49.720 --> 28:51.756
but four hostiles
just went in5ide.

28:51.790 --> 28:53.223
They're rounding them
up for transport.

28:53.260 --> 28:55.023
TEAM LEADER:
Bravo Team, this is Alpha.

28:55.060 --> 28:56.357
We're in position on the stern.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.822
Alpha, hold.

28:57.870 --> 29:00.964
SONNY: None of these mopes
have suppressers.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.969
It's gonna get real loud
if they start firing.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.035
TOC, this is Bravo 1.
You better get our exfil up

29:06.070 --> 29:08.470
and going 'cause this
whole island is about
to know we're here.

29:08.510 --> 29:10.432
Copy that.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.948
Alpha, want you to
beeline for the bridge.

29:12.980 --> 29:14.971
We're going below
decks. Stand by.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.942

Roger that.

29:16.980 --> 29:18.311
Move.

31:43.730 --> 31:46.198
US. military. Stay calm
and get prepared to move.

31:46.230 --> 31:48.198
(woman screams)

31:48.240 --> 31:51.061
TOC, this is Bravo 4.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.202
11 hostages secured.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.333
Bravo 1 and 2 pursuing the last.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.506
ERIC:
Roger, Bravo 4.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.428
Your boats are one mike out.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.402
We'll get him back.
Don't worry.

31:59.450 --> 32:01.179
VINCE:
Help! Help me!

32:01.220 --> 32:04.144
(Mercado shouts in Tagalog)

32:04.190 --> 32:05.646
VINCE:
Help! Help! Help!

32:05.690 --> 32:07.248
(grunting)

32:07.290 --> 32:09.110
(Mercado shouts in Tagalog)

32:12.190 --> 32:14.226
(indistinct shouting)

32:14.260 --> 32:15.591
RAY: We breach,
the hostage dies.

32:15.630 --> 32:16.949
Can't leave him here.
Maybe we can talk him out.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.160
MANDY:
TOC to Bravo 1.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.225
I have multiple hostiles
inbound.

32:20.270 --> 32:21.191
Two minutes from the port.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.128
You need to exfil those hostages
immediately.

32:23.170 --> 32:25.309
So much for talking him out.

32:25.340 --> 32:27.262
Sniper overwatch,
anyone got a shot?

32:27.310 --> 32:30.131
OVERWATCH: Negative. Bravo has
the only breach point.

32:30.180 --> 32:31.647
(Vince shouting)

32:31.680 --> 32:34.148
Oh, no. It's that look again.

32:34.180 --> 32:35.408
It's not the only way in.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.323
(Mercado shouting in Tagalog)

32:47.430 --> 32:49.318
Well, that's a pretty
tight shot, brother.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.260
Well, you know what...

32:51.300 --> 32:52.369
I've made tighter.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.662
Sure you have, Romeo.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.236
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is TOC.

32:55.270 --> 32:56.760
You've got trucks rolling up
at your dock.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.303
They are not friendly.
I repeat: they are not friendly.

32:59.340 --> 33:00.329
Buy us some time, Ray.

33:00.370 --> 33:01.576
Copy that.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.311
*

33:15.260 --> 33:17.319
(engine rewing nearby,
men shouting)

33:17.360 --> 33:19.385
(automatic gunfire)

33:27.100 --> 33:28.135
(man screams)

33:32.140 --> 33:34.131
(automatic gunfire continues)

33:36.610 --> 33:38.601
Bravo 2 to Bravo 1.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.447
Not gonna be able
to hold them all off.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.744
Boss, you need
to take that shot.

33:42.780 --> 33:44.782
(automatic gunfire continues)

33:47.190 --> 33:49.249
(Mercado shouting in Tagalog)

33:59.600 --> 34:01.329
(continues shouting)

34:06.470 --> 34:07.698
(silenced shot, men grunting)

34:07.740 --> 34:09.708
Let's go.
Get him out of there. Now.

34:20.790 --> 34:21.757
(bullets striking)

34:21.790 --> 34:23.257
Time to go!

34:24.890 --> 34:26.255
We'll cover your exfil.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.594
With me, with me!

34:33.630 --> 34:34.562
Cover the rear!

34:44.780 --> 34:46.202
Go, go, go, go, go!

34:46.250 --> 34:47.649
Move, move, move!

34:47.680 --> 34:49.318
Move! Let's go!

34:50.850 --> 34:51.839
Move!

34:51.890 --> 34:53.187
Come on. Let's move!

34:53.220 --> 34:54.380
Go, go, go!

34:54.420 --> 34:55.648
Go!

34:59.290 --> 35:01.292
(automatic gunfire continues)

35:04.730 --> 35:06.095
Let's go.

35:10.340 --> 35:11.637
Alpha boat, coming in hot.

35:27.950 --> 35:29.918
*

35:29.960 --> 35:32.679
It's okay.

35:35.330 --> 35:37.457
Everybody okay?

35:37.500 --> 35:38.194
Thank you.

35:38.230 --> 35:39.788
Couple of hostages
are dinged up,

35:39.830 --> 35:42.890
but overall, we're good.

35:42.940 --> 35:46.262
RAY:
Just like we drew it up, huh?

35:47.970 --> 35:50.575
*

36:06.860 --> 36:08.521
Man, you were just
trying to help

36:08.560 --> 36:10.448
and I was kind of being a click
the other night, I'm sorry.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.526
"Kind of"?

36:15.740 --> 36:19.403
I'm sorry, too.
I was being real preachy.

36:19.440 --> 36:22.534
Well, I, um... I
should've listened.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.400
You know, I just, uh...

36:24.450 --> 36:26.475
man, I kept digging myself
in deeper and deeper

36:26.510 --> 36:27.807
these last few days.

36:27.850 --> 36:29.818
You know, there's just...

36:29.850 --> 36:31.681
I don't know. There's something
about the Selection process

36:31.720 --> 36:33.210
that just makes me...

36:33.250 --> 36:35.753
Need to prove that you're better
than the rest of us?

36:35.790 --> 36:36.916
(laughs softly)
No.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.485
No, it's not that, it's...

36:39.530 --> 36:42.920
It's just-it's just
making DEVGRU is the only thing

36:42.960 --> 36:44.825
I've ever dreamed of doing
my entire life,

36:44.870 --> 36:46.826
and now, suddenly, I'm wondering
what my life might look like

36:46.870 --> 36:48.394
if I don't make it.

36:49.570 --> 36:52.539
That's an awful lot of weight
to put on your back

36:52.570 --> 36:55.232
every time you got to go out
and run the 0 course.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.236
Yeah, you're right.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.771
(sniffles)

36:59.810 --> 37:01.619
I just need to worry
about the mission,

37:01.650 --> 37:02.969
guys to my left,
guys to my right.

37:03.020 --> 37:04.510
Yeah, man.

37:04.550 --> 37:05.744
Do that,

37:05.790 --> 37:08.486
there's not a SEAL alive who
wouldn't want to roll with you.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.754
While we're on the subject
of apologies,

37:17.800 --> 37:19.768
probably owe Stella one.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.290
(laughs)

37:21.340 --> 37:23.331
(chuckles)

37:23.370 --> 37:24.564
Yeah, that was some,

37:24.610 --> 37:27.966
some serious only-child sulking
the other night, wasn't it?

37:28.010 --> 37:29.739
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, man.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.475
(clears throat)

37:31.510 --> 37:32.602
She'd be good for you, though.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.538
Good for all of us,
really.

37:34.580 --> 37:35.376
How's that?

37:35.420 --> 37:36.842
She might be the only person
on Earth

37:36.880 --> 37:38.984
that can keep your ego in check.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.840
(laughs)

37:40.890 --> 37:42.653
Get out of here, man.

37:42.690 --> 37:44.829
Night, brother.
All right.

37:53.570 --> 37:54.798
(indistinct chatter)

37:54.840 --> 37:56.899
(exhales)

37:59.970 --> 38:01.631
Hey.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.342
You know, I'm gonna grab a drink
with Sonny a little bit later,

38:04.380 --> 38:05.642
if you want to join.

38:05.680 --> 38:06.840
Oh, thanks. I-I, uh,

38:06.880 --> 38:08.040
think I'm gonna head home.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.718
Okay, cool.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.638
I don't know if I'd want
to hang out with Sonny myself,

38:11.690 --> 38:12.918
ifI didn't know him.
(chuckles)

38:12.950 --> 38:16.408
It's not because I don't want to
hang out With you. Believe me.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.485
My role here makes
it complicated.

38:18.530 --> 38:19.451
Yeah, I get it.

38:19.490 --> 38:21.629
You know, it's better
to stay on the outside.

38:21.660 --> 38:23.992
It used to drive me crazy.

38:24.030 --> 38:26.419
Do all the work getting
a bead on a target,

38:26.470 --> 38:27.789
just to have
to hand off to the boys

38:27.830 --> 38:29.695
once it was time
to actually take it down.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.662
My control issues?

38:33.440 --> 38:38.776
I located the hostages,
and it was nearly a disaster.

38:38.810 --> 38:40.607
They could've all been killed.

38:40.650 --> 38:42.572
Yeah, well, they weren't.
They could've.

38:42.620 --> 38:43.871
And some have been.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.478
I mean, it's a lot to bear.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.659
I keep my distance
because I need to.

38:48.690 --> 38:49.679
Not because I want to.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.654
Well, you never send me
into the line of fire,

38:51.690 --> 38:53.851
so... offer stands.

38:53.890 --> 38:54.993
(laughs)

38:55.030 --> 38:57.089
Next time.
Okay.

39:02.170 --> 39:03.637
CLAY: I was projecting
my fear of failure at work

39:03.670 --> 39:05.365
onto a fear of failure with you.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.469
STELLA (laughs): You're really
gonna feed me psychobabble?

39:07.510 --> 39:09.478
Really?

39:09.510 --> 39:11.842
It depends. Is it working?

39:11.880 --> 39:14.417
(sighs)
I don't know.

39:16.450 --> 39:20.716
All right. Well,
you said that you're sorry.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.752
Now what?

39:26.730 --> 39:28.789
What's this?

39:28.830 --> 39:30.991
Villette by Charlotte Bronte.

39:34.570 --> 39:35.992
Nice. Actually wrote my...

39:36.040 --> 39:38.429
Your thesis on it.

39:38.470 --> 39:39.607
You're a hell of a writer.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.671
Is this a first edition?

39:46.710 --> 39:47.779
No.

39:47.810 --> 39:49.516
No.

39:49.550 --> 39:51.484
You know, now-now's actually,
probably a good time for me

39:51.520 --> 39:52.680
to tell you how little I make.

39:55.590 --> 39:58.582
Well, as far as apologies go,
this is, um,

39:58.630 --> 39:59.756
this is pretty good.

39:59.790 --> 40:01.121
Probably a B-plus.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.798
B-plus?

40:03.730 --> 40:05.618
Tough grader.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.092
How can I possibly
give you an "A"

40:07.130 --> 40:09.098
w_hen flowers _
are the universal way of saying

40:09.140 --> 40:11.563
"Sorry for being
such a jackass"?

40:11.610 --> 40:13.532
I'd have given you flowers, but
then, you would've accused me

40:13.570 --> 40:16.004
of equating my apology
to your reproductive organs.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.474
Or violating
your safe space.

40:18.510 --> 40:20.774
Would you please leave my
reproductive organs out of this?

40:26.750 --> 40:29.787
I, uh... I should hit the road.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.458
No, no. I mean...

40:31.490 --> 40:32.650
(laughs)

40:32.690 --> 40:33.987
I mean, you just drove
all the way here.

40:34.030 --> 40:37.454
You might as well just come in
for, like, a minute.

40:40.770 --> 40:42.761
(Stella clears throat)

40:49.540 --> 40:51.906
(laughs)

40:51.950 --> 40:53.906
(clears throat)

40:53.950 --> 40:56.874
You know, SEALs prepare
for all scenarios.

40:56.920 --> 40:58.911
Mm-hmm.

41:00.950 --> 41:02.781
Shames me to admit this,
but, um,

41:04.560 --> 41:07.085
used your ninja skills
to break in here.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.758
Would it ruin the moment
if I told you

41:09.800 --> 41:11.256
that I left the flowers
with your roommate?

41:11.300 --> 41:13.894
Definitely.

41:13.930 --> 41:17.536
*

41:17.570 --> 41:22.837
* Oh, how I want you

41:22.880 --> 41:28.000
* So curious now

41:28.050 --> 41:30.678
* You give power to me

41:30.720 --> 41:32.813
(laughs)

41:32.850 --> 41:35.717
* And your voice

41:35.760 --> 41:38.684
* Sings through me

41:38.730 --> 41:42.928
* Oh, how I want you.

41:52.070 --> 41:54.061
(train whistle blows
in distance)

42:00.780 --> 42:02.771
(dog barking in distance)

42:19.830 --> 42:21.969
(camera shutter
clicking steadily)
