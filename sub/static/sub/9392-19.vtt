Come on, Stewie. Hurry up.
I want to get good seats.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.340
Ugh, I hate going to hear
authors read from their work.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.542
That Dr. Seuss reading
was dreadful.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.844
And when the drugs
stopped numbing the pain,

00:45.846 --> 00:47.880
the sex became
even more violent.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.048
It doesn't rhyme.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.116
The new stuff
doesn't rhyme!

00:52.085 --> 00:53.685
Hey, there.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.854
You a big fan
of Jonathan Franzen?

00:55.856 --> 00:57.923
Oh, my God,
I worship him.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.691
Yeah, yeah, of all
my writing students,

00:59.693 --> 01:01.193
he's probably
done the best.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.694
I'm sorry,
everybody.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.330
Mr. Franzen has informed us
he's not coming.

01:05.332 --> 01:08.867
Like most real authors, he's
too good for this dumb town.

01:08.869 --> 01:09.935
(all groaning)

01:09.937 --> 01:11.503
MAN:
I hate it here.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.372
Well, this crowd
was promised an author.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.307
No!

01:15.309 --> 01:17.643
Oh, well, you know, I guess
I should be getting back

01:17.645 --> 01:18.811
to my dorm anyway.

01:18.813 --> 01:19.878
I've got a short story due

01:19.880 --> 01:21.346
for my creative writing
class tomorrow.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.015
Oh, creative
writing, huh?

01:23.017 --> 01:25.150
Well, if you'd like me to look
it over before you turn it in,

01:25.152 --> 01:26.919
I'd be happy to.
Really?

01:26.921 --> 01:28.153
(giggles)
That'd be great.

01:28.155 --> 01:29.955
Cool, cool,
I'll follow you in my car.

01:29.957 --> 01:30.989
(whispering):
Come on. We're going.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.324
All right,
hold on.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.793
Is this what your parents are
paying all that tuition for--

01:34.795 --> 01:36.929
so you can
(bleep) dogs?

01:43.937 --> 01:46.772
I'll print up for you
what I have so far.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.040
Okay, I'm gonna go
in there with her.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.608
You just sit out here
and be quiet.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.677
Here, watch one of her
movies or something.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.347
Ugh, <i>Charlie St. Cloud?</i>

01:55.349 --> 01:57.116
A-And why are there
so many fingerprints on this?

01:57.118 --> 02:01.820
Who's handling their <i>Charlie</i>
<i>St. Cloud</i> DVD all the time?

02:10.096 --> 02:14.266
Lois, can I have
a Pop-Tart in bed, please?

02:14.268 --> 02:15.934
Lois?

02:15.936 --> 02:16.935
Hey, Chris?

02:16.937 --> 02:18.437
CHRIS:
Yeah?

02:18.439 --> 02:21.306
Do you think Lois would be okay
if I ate a Pop-Tart in bed?

02:21.308 --> 02:22.307
Probably.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.509
Probably, right?

02:23.511 --> 02:25.711
Lois, you in the bathroom?

02:25.713 --> 02:28.113
(gasping)

02:32.118 --> 02:34.319
Well, Mrs. Griffin,
you have three crushed ribs,

02:34.321 --> 02:36.121
but I was able to stop
the internal bleeding.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.924
Doctor, this has happened
seven times in the last month.

02:38.926 --> 02:42.027
Peter rolls over in his sleep
and almost kills me.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.095
I see.

02:43.097 --> 02:44.096
Well, that sucks.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.631
Look, I don't do it
on purpose.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.599
Well, it looks like you got
a handle on it then.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.767
No, we don't.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.669
He practically
smothers me every night.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.970
Well, are you hogging
the blankets?

02:51.972 --> 02:53.172
No.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.007
"Probably hogging
blankets."

02:55.009 --> 02:57.376
And if he's not smothering me,
he's keeping me up all night

02:57.378 --> 03:00.012
writing with that
giant plume of his.

03:00.014 --> 03:03.949
"Dearest Augustine,
I do hope this latest damp

03:03.951 --> 03:05.484
has not aggravated
your gray lung."

03:05.486 --> 03:06.919
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

03:06.921 --> 03:09.321
"Matters stateside
have taken a tragic turn

03:09.323 --> 03:11.423
"as this year's gourd crop
has fallen prey

03:11.425 --> 03:13.425
"to a rather
unexpected infestation

03:13.427 --> 03:14.826
of saltmarsh cutworms."

03:14.828 --> 03:15.994
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.596
Peter, it's 4:00
in the morning.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.131
Come to bed!

03:19.133 --> 03:22.100
"Marital concerns continue
to bedevil me."

03:24.771 --> 03:26.772
Look, I'm sorry.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.274
I wasn't planning on
spending all night there.

03:29.276 --> 03:32.010
Look, how about if I take
you to the park, huh?

03:32.012 --> 03:34.813
Come on. You like
the park, right?

03:34.815 --> 03:37.015
We're about to
pass the turnoff.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.918
Here it comes.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.154
You may take me
to the park.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.094
Um, excuse me. I didn't
bring any of my toys.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.662
Can I play with
some of yours?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.731
No! Mine!

03:54.133 --> 03:56.468
Are you all right?

03:56.470 --> 03:57.769
I'm fine.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.105
I-I didn't push him back
because he has leukemia.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.206
My name's Penelope.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.207
What's yours?

04:02.209 --> 04:03.308
Stewie.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.943
I've never seen you
around here before.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.446
I'm new to town and I
don't have many friends.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.914
(chuckling):
All right.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.416
A lot of pressure on me
instantly, but okay.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.819
Would you like to play with
some of my toys, Stewie?

04:13.821 --> 04:14.920
Well, what have you got?

04:14.922 --> 04:16.655
I have a set of jacks,
a paddleball,

04:16.657 --> 04:18.523
and this taffy
with superglue.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.792
Isn't that the little
boy who pushed you?

04:20.794 --> 04:22.027
Hmm, yes.

04:22.029 --> 04:26.031
You there, would you like
a piece of candy?

04:29.636 --> 04:31.703
(choking)

04:37.143 --> 04:39.211
Don't push.

04:43.483 --> 04:46.251
Uh, Lois, why do we have
Lucy and Ricky beds?

04:46.253 --> 04:49.021
Because I'm sick of you crushing
me in the middle of the night.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.922
Dr. Hartman called
about my X rays.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.191
He said my spine
is now disfigured.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.694
Lois, if God wanted me
to not sleep with my wife,

04:55.696 --> 04:57.129
he would have made me
John Travolta.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.764
Peter, I'm really
tired, okay?

04:58.766 --> 05:00.832
Just give the bed a try.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.205
There you go.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.974
Good night, Peter.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.143
I can't sleep like this, Lois.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.644
I need someone to cuddle with.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.513
Believe it or not,
men like to cuddle,

05:14.515 --> 05:17.482
even cold, unfeeling men
like Charles Bronson.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.985
Hey, Charles Bronson's wife.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.988
Scooch over.
I want to cuddle.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.090
Mmm, that's nice.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.430
I don't know
what the big deal is.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.932
I stopped for one drink
after work.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.767
Yes, but it's
every night.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.970
There, now you can be
upset about that.

05:38.972 --> 05:39.971
This is fun.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.440
I like playing
with you, Penelope.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.774
What shall
we play next?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.276
Well, let's see
what you have.

05:44.278 --> 05:47.346
You have a pop-up version
of the <i>Unabomber's Manifesto?</i>

05:47.348 --> 05:51.016
Yes, at the end the brother
pops up and turns you in.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.922
What's this
on your Etch A Sketch?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.824
Oh, those are some advanced
mathematical formulas

05:58.826 --> 06:00.492
I've just been
tinkering with.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.094
You're kidding?
I do that, too.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.196
But what are
these formulas for?

06:04.198 --> 06:06.498
For these.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.307
(gasps)
Oh, my God,

06:15.309 --> 06:16.608
you've got a weapons room, too?

06:16.610 --> 06:17.809
And look at the size of it.

06:17.811 --> 06:18.944
It's amazing.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.213
Yes, although sometimes
I think it's too big.

06:21.215 --> 06:24.116
It takes the cleaning woman
forever to clean it.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.055
Was already broken.

06:37.096 --> 06:38.430
My word, Penelope,

06:38.432 --> 06:40.699
you and I seem to have
quite a lot in common.

06:40.701 --> 06:41.967
Do you actually
use these?

06:41.969 --> 06:44.669
Only when fear, spite, jealousy,
and revenge demand.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.005
I bought that to kill the women
from <i>Sex and the City,</i>

06:47.007 --> 06:49.674
but time seems
to be doing it for me.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.476
(gasps)
You're wicked.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.044
Do your parents
have any idea?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.212
My mother's
not a concern.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.480
I don't really have
to worry

06:55.482 --> 06:56.815
about her anymore.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.751
Oh, do you have one of those
white wine zombie moms?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.019
No, she died.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.087
She was taking a tub

07:02.089 --> 07:04.689
and somebody came in
and cut her head off.

07:04.691 --> 07:05.991
Wait a moment.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.960
Did... did you kill her?

07:08.962 --> 07:12.931
Well, I held the knife...
and her hair.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.168
Oh, my God, I've been dreaming
about doing that for years,

07:16.170 --> 07:18.303
and you've actually gone ahead
and done it.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.038
Penelope...

07:20.040 --> 07:21.807
I've never said this
to anyone before,

07:21.809 --> 07:25.310
but I feel like I may have
finally found, in you,

07:25.312 --> 07:27.646
my one true soul mate.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.114
Do you feel this way, too?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.482
I do, Stewart.

07:30.484 --> 07:33.018
It's as if our meeting were
more than a mere coincidence.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.487
It's as if we were
meant to be together.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.655
Indeed.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.324
This must be how Maverick felt
when he met Goose.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.926
I feel the need.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.928
The need for speed.
The need for speed.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.030
And Scientology.
No, just speed.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.602
So, listen, Quagmire,
there's something

07:50.604 --> 07:52.437
I kind of wanted
to talk to you about.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.607
E-Ever since Lois got us
twin beds, I can't fall asleep.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.375
I'm used to having
another person there.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.711
I know. I always sleep better
when I'm next to someone.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.712
Yeah, it's only
natural, right?

08:00.714 --> 08:01.980
I'm glad to hear
you say that

08:01.982 --> 08:04.816
'cause, you know, I guess
what I'm trying to say is,

08:04.818 --> 08:07.786
I... want to propose
an arrangement

08:07.788 --> 08:09.921
that could benefit
the both of us.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.122
Okay.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.325
Men need someone to spoon with
and snuggle with

08:13.327 --> 08:17.929
just the same as women, and when
you don't have that, it-it's...

08:17.931 --> 08:20.198
I... well,
what I'm getting at is...

08:21.300 --> 08:25.337
I would like for you
to sleep with me in my bed,

08:25.339 --> 08:27.772
and this, this is not about sex;
it's about sleep.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.140
No, no, I totally
get it, Peter.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.375
Snuggling is a
basic human need.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.711
Right, I mean, who says
that the body next to you

08:32.713 --> 08:34.312
has to be male or female
or... whatever?

08:34.314 --> 08:35.313
Or alive.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.315
Yeah... well, no,
but, yeah.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.084
Look, I, I think
it's a great idea

08:39.086 --> 08:40.118
and I, I'm completely with you.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.486
I'm in. Let's try it.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.089
Yay, that is
such good news.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.924
And I'm so happy
they gave us a booth.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.125
I know, 'cause they're
supposed to be reserved

08:47.127 --> 08:48.326
for parties of
three or more.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.728
I know!

08:52.598 --> 08:55.300
Oh, Stewie, it's so nice
to finally have someone

08:55.302 --> 08:56.968
to do naughty
things with.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.003
Definitely.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.304
All right, I made
a wallet bomb

08:59.306 --> 09:00.805
and I planted it
on Mort.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.408
As soon
as he opens it-- boom.

09:05.645 --> 09:09.080
(both giggling)

09:13.019 --> 09:14.352
Oh, bloody hell.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.922
How do you go two weeks
without opening your wallet?

09:16.924 --> 09:18.924
Yeah, he's been out
to dinner, like, four times.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.259
We're clearly not going
to get him this way.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.929
I know, which is why
I just planted another bomb

09:23.931 --> 09:26.998
that's set to go off every time
he burps into his hand.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.401
(stifled burp)

09:32.004 --> 09:36.074
Ohh, I'd better make sure
my wallet's okay.

09:40.947 --> 09:43.114
I say, we're
on quite a run.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.583
We blew up the
Great Wall of China,

09:44.585 --> 09:46.918
bombed the Eiffel Tower, and
look at this note I sent off.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.187
"Dear Pakistan,
Up yours.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.655
Love, India."

09:50.657 --> 09:52.223
Let's see
what happens.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.331
They did not need much.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.800
All right,
Stewie, your turn.

10:01.802 --> 10:05.003
Okay, I have to destroy
Copenhagen with a...

10:05.005 --> 10:07.672
tidal wave,
and the theme is...

10:07.674 --> 10:09.007
the Roaring Twenties.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.043
Tha-That's, that's,
that's a challenge.

10:15.982 --> 10:19.651
("Charleston" playing)

10:19.653 --> 10:22.854
Roarin' twenten tidal waven!

10:30.997 --> 10:32.364
Peter, what's
going on?

10:32.366 --> 10:34.199
Quagmire's having
a sleepover with me.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.767
You can't
be serious.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.335
Look, Lois, I told you
that I need

10:37.337 --> 10:39.437
to have somebody
sleeping next to me.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.106
All right, now if that's
not going to be you...

10:41.108 --> 10:42.374
Fine. Do what you want.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.643
I don't care,
but I think it's very strange.

10:44.645 --> 10:45.944
Okay, that's the
one thing it's not.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.178
Yeah, it's not strange.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.248
I already told you:
I don't care.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.616
It's not strange.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.817
I know.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.985
All right,
let's see here.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.621
Now just, uh, wrap
yourself around me.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.756
Is that okay?

10:57.758 --> 10:59.658
Yeah, actually, you can
hold me even tighter.

10:59.660 --> 11:03.128
Okay, I just need to put
this arm right around here.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.763
Yeah, there we go.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.066
Good, now let's just
fall asleep like this.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.935
Your boxers are
a little starchy.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.704
Can I take 'em off
with my foot?

11:12.706 --> 11:14.773
Sure.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.946
Come on, you.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.654
Good evening.
I'm Tom Tucker.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.690
Our top story:
Authorities are still searching

11:31.692 --> 11:34.659
for the culprits in a series
of horrific acts of destruction

11:34.661 --> 11:36.928
all across-- scroll down, guys--

11:36.930 --> 11:38.263
the globe.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.464
That could've fit on there.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.332
There was a long space
at the end of that line.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.501
My God, it's you,
isn't it?

11:43.503 --> 11:44.769
It's you and Penelope

11:44.771 --> 11:46.304
who've been doing
all of these horrible things.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.872
So? I've always been
about world domination.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.208
What the hell did you think
I was talking about when I said,

11:50.210 --> 11:51.710
"Victory shall be mine"?

11:51.712 --> 11:53.778
You have not said that
in a very long time.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.013
Well, I'm back on it.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.649
Stewie, Penelope is taking you
down a dark path.

11:57.651 --> 11:59.517
Look, in the past
you've done terrible things,

11:59.519 --> 12:01.119
but it's always been
about the pursuit

12:01.121 --> 12:02.921
of your greater goal
of world domination.

12:02.923 --> 12:06.758
But this girl-- she just creates
chaos for the sake of chaos.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.759
So, what are you saying?

12:07.761 --> 12:09.427
I'm saying she's
a bad influence on you,

12:09.429 --> 12:10.995
and you should stop spending
time with her.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.330
I shall do no such thing.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.932
Penelope is wonderful.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.567
We're going to be
together forever.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.637
Well, Rupert,
this is a big mess.

12:19.639 --> 12:22.006
What the hell were you
doing talking to him?

12:27.313 --> 12:29.347
You know who I think
is an ugly slut?

12:29.349 --> 12:30.448
Miss Sharon.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.117
Miss Sharon
from your day care?

12:32.119 --> 12:32.984
Yes.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.786
This is a map of her house.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.121
I thought we could
burn her in her bed

12:36.123 --> 12:37.322
while her children watch.

12:37.324 --> 12:38.790
You know, Penelope,

12:38.792 --> 12:41.626
maybe we don't have
to kill someone every day.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.828
There are other things to do.

12:43.830 --> 12:44.763
Like what?

12:44.765 --> 12:45.930
I-I don't know.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.365
You know what? Forget it.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.001
I-I think Brian just got
in my head a bit. That's all.

12:50.003 --> 12:50.969
Brian?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.971
Why? What did Brian say?

12:52.973 --> 12:56.341
He just thinks that you're
a bad influence on me.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.476
(chuckles)
T-Thinks I should stop
seeing you.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.811
He does?

12:59.813 --> 13:01.813
How dare he!

13:01.815 --> 13:03.014
Babe? Babe?

13:03.016 --> 13:04.149
Don't worry about it,
all right?

13:04.151 --> 13:06.651
Stewart, do you love me?

13:06.653 --> 13:07.952
More than anything.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.488
Then swear on that love
that you'll do what I ask.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.689
Just name it.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.291
Kill him.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.959
Kill Brian for me.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.028
(soap opera-like musical sting)

13:17.030 --> 13:20.665
SOAP OPERA ANNOUNCER:
Family Guy <i>is brought to you</i>
<i>by AXE Body Spray.</i>

13:20.667 --> 13:23.168
<i>AXE Body Spray:</i>
<i>Spray it on after gym class</i>

13:23.170 --> 13:25.303
<i>instead of getting beat up</i>
<i>in the shower.</i>

13:25.305 --> 13:27.839
<i>Kind of weird those guys</i>
<i>want to fight you naked, huh?</i>

13:27.841 --> 13:29.040
<i>AXE Body Spray.</i>

13:36.982 --> 13:39.250
Oh, God, I can't kill Brian.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.752
Even for Penelope.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.854
He's my dog, my friend.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.189
Well, I wonder what words

13:44.191 --> 13:46.491
are gonna come
out of this pen today.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.992
All right, I can do this.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.074
(grunts)

14:07.813 --> 14:09.614
Oh, who am I kidding?

14:09.616 --> 14:11.149
I can't do this.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.051
(sneezes)

14:21.760 --> 14:25.496

15:15.014 --> 15:17.749
I don't care how many children

15:17.751 --> 15:18.950
You're fired.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.852
(Cockney accent):
But I was only
having a child

15:20.854 --> 15:22.186
because you
and the mister...

15:22.188 --> 15:26.324
You don't get to speak
of me and the mister!

15:26.326 --> 15:28.626
Ah, Stewie.
So did you do it?

15:28.628 --> 15:31.462
Have you removed that wretched
cur from our existence?

15:31.464 --> 15:34.032
I just couldn't bring myself
to kill him, Penelope.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.434
Brian is my best friend.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.002
Perhaps you're right.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.138
Perhaps it was wrong of me
to ask you to do such a thing.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.806
Oh, thank you.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.975
I'm so glad you're being
so understanding about this.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.678
I was actually dreading
having to tell you about this.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.112
Bleah.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.748
It appears I'll have
to kill him myself.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.952
I knew you were too weak
to do this.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.253
You're nothing but a coward.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.088
No, Penelope, wait!

15:57.090 --> 15:59.624
(groans)
Strong women always turn out
to be nightmares.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.192
Like Joan of Arc.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.995
Hey, guys,
I'm not like other girls.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.464
I kill people and burp
and watch so much porn.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.299
Isn't that cool?
No.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.034
I like a lot
of goofball comedies

16:10.036 --> 16:11.803
that other chicks don't like.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.272
My favorite thing to play
is   <i>Call of Duty.</i>

16:14.274 --> 16:17.508
Look me up.
I'm GuitarGurrrl76.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.010
Let's burn this chick
at the stake.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.311
I love steak!

16:20.313 --> 16:21.579
Other girls don't.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.014
I'm actually more like a dude.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.849
Hey, guys,
don't come in my room.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.352
I might be rubbin' one in.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.590
Peter, this is ridiculous.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.325
It's time for you
to come home.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.927
I live here now, Lois.

16:35.929 --> 16:38.363
Look, I'm sorry
that I ever got us separate...

16:38.365 --> 16:39.964
Is that a bracelet
you're wearing?

16:39.966 --> 16:41.299
It's a giggity band, Lois.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.767
You wouldn't understand.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.369
Look, Peter,
if you come home now,

16:44.371 --> 16:45.870
we can get our old bed back,

16:45.872 --> 16:47.972
and you can snuggle with me
as much as you want.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.273
Well...

16:49.275 --> 16:51.009
You promise?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.477
I promise.

16:52.479 --> 16:56.014
'Cause, you know,
I missed cuddling with you, too.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.015
You did?

16:57.017 --> 16:58.916
I sure did.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.085
Well, then, hey...

17:01.087 --> 17:03.588
what do you say we go home, huh?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.823
Sounds good to me.

17:05.825 --> 17:09.861
(gasping)

17:13.198 --> 17:15.299
Oh, Brian, there you are!

17:15.301 --> 17:16.701
Thank God.
Oh, hey, Stewie.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.036
Did you make that coffee?

17:18.038 --> 17:19.604
Um, no, it was here
when I came in.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.706
I assume Lois made it.
Don't drink that!

17:21.708 --> 17:24.142
Hey, that mug was my crew
gift from "Class Holes."

17:24.144 --> 17:25.676
Did you take a bite
out of this donut?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.278
Yeah, it was from a
box on the counter.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.679
So what?
How long ago?

17:28.681 --> 17:29.847
I don't know. Five minutes?

17:29.849 --> 17:31.182
There's still time.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.086
(gagging)

17:35.088 --> 17:38.122
(coughing)
God, Stewie, are you
out of your mind?

17:38.124 --> 17:39.991
Trust me, I'm only doing
what's best for you.

17:39.993 --> 17:42.794
Well, I do feel pretty
thin and wonderful.

17:42.796 --> 17:44.328
And I still got
to eat the donut.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.830
Why isn't everybody
doing this?

17:45.832 --> 17:47.732
(doorbell rings)
They are.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.536
I've got a package here
for Brian Griffin.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.637
Oh, that's me.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.205
Brian, no!

17:57.009 --> 17:59.110
Stewie, what the hell
is going on?

17:59.112 --> 18:00.678
I'm so sorry, Brian.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.680
Penelope told me
I had to kill you

18:02.682 --> 18:04.015
because you said
we should break up,

18:04.017 --> 18:05.817
but I couldn't bring myself
to do it.

18:05.819 --> 18:08.152
So then she said
she was gonna kill you and...

18:08.154 --> 18:10.988
This-this is not for you.

18:12.024 --> 18:12.990
That was weird.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.125
W-What was he doing?

18:14.127 --> 18:16.094
Anyway, Penelope's
trying to kill you!

18:16.096 --> 18:17.695
I told you she was bad news.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.530
Look, let's just get you
someplace safe.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.066
Dude, get out of here.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.638
Stewie, step aside.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.507
Penelope,
I can't let you do this.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.975
Stewie, she's
one year old.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.376
I think I can
handle this myself.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.249
All right, Stewie, tag in.

18:45.257 --> 18:49.827
Slo-o-w mo-o-o-tion
di-i-ving at yo-o-u!

19:07.813 --> 19:09.147
(yells)

19:09.149 --> 19:10.414
Anti-gravity gun!

19:10.416 --> 19:12.116
This is beyond my technology.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.152
Perhaps if I detonate
an electromagnetic pulse,

19:14.154 --> 19:15.419
it will disable it.

19:21.593 --> 19:24.195
(grunting, groaning)

19:40.679 --> 19:42.013
(yells)

19:55.794 --> 19:57.028
(yells)

20:09.041 --> 20:11.108
Stay away from my dog.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.977
Very well, Stewie. I shall.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.779
But just one thing.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.913
What?

20:24.790 --> 20:26.357
(gasps)

20:30.696 --> 20:32.763
(horn honks)

20:37.636 --> 20:39.003
That was...

20:39.005 --> 20:40.805
beautiful.
