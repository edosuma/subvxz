NARRATOR:
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.208 --> 00:05.458
Your plan is reaching
fruition, my lord.

00:05.458 --> 00:09.958
Soon the Savage Land
will be cleansed of
all disbelievers,

00:09.958 --> 00:13.500
and the Age of Garokk
will begin anew.

00:13.500 --> 00:17.166
I know you must absorb
mutant life-energy

00:17.166 --> 00:19.875
to retain your
powers as Sauron.

00:20.583 --> 00:22.875
GAROKK: The time has come.

00:23.708 --> 00:24.875
(YELLS)

00:26.416 --> 00:29.583
It's mutant energy. No!

00:33.833 --> 00:35.333
(YELLS)

00:35.833 --> 00:37.500
Free again!

00:38.833 --> 00:42.000
Look into my eyes,
wind rider.

00:44.458 --> 00:48.875
Deep within
this weather witch
lies untold power.

00:50.166 --> 00:52.958
GAROKK: Release
the weather witch.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.000
(SCREAMING)

00:57.833 --> 01:00.875
Garokk's will be done!

01:02.125 --> 01:03.750
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:04.708 --> 02:06.333
(STORM LAUGHS MADLY)

02:06.333 --> 02:10.958
STORM: Rage, winds,
your mistress craves more!

02:12.416 --> 02:14.458
Storm's out of her mind!

02:14.458 --> 02:16.458
It's Sauron's doing.

02:16.458 --> 02:19.958
His hypnotic powers have
taken away her self-control.

02:21.708 --> 02:27.625
Rain, lightning, thunder,
your power is mine!

02:28.375 --> 02:30.875
Come to me.

02:30.875 --> 02:32.458
How do we stop her?

02:32.458 --> 02:34.958
If Jubilee of the jungle
can take down Sauron,

02:34.958 --> 02:37.083
then Storm
should be a snap.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Jubilee, stop!
Where do you think
you're going?

02:45.208 --> 02:48.750
Let the primal forces
of nature

02:48.750 --> 02:51.458
continue to be unleashed!

02:54.000 --> 02:55.458
(SCREECHING)

03:00.291 --> 03:03.000
Foolish child. Be gone!

03:03.708 --> 03:05.833
Hey! Help!

03:06.500 --> 03:09.000
Jubilee of the jungle.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
By your command,
I have released
the weather witch.

03:13.875 --> 03:17.458
GAROKK: I feel myself
growing stronger.

03:17.458 --> 03:21.166
It is what I have
awaited for centuries.

03:21.583 --> 03:27.083
Her elemental power surges
throughout the Savage Land,

03:27.083 --> 03:29.000
feeding me.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.208
No! No!

03:38.000 --> 03:39.458
Yes.

03:40.375 --> 03:43.000
It has begun.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.708
(THUNDER CRACKLING)

04:01.208 --> 04:05.208
All right, Lykos.
What did you do to make
Storm wig out like this?

04:05.208 --> 04:07.083
I did nothing.

04:07.083 --> 04:09.458
Sauron took away
her control.

04:09.458 --> 04:14.500
His powers of suggestion
are far beyond those
of normal hypnosis.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.333
ROGUE: I can
vouch for that.

04:18.750 --> 04:22.583
BEAST: Has Storm added
earthquakes to her
meteorological repertoire?

04:22.583 --> 04:25.083
This ain't
no earthquake.

04:28.208 --> 04:29.833
Stampede!

04:29.833 --> 04:31.208
This way!

04:33.375 --> 04:35.500
(SCREECHING)

04:40.208 --> 04:43.500
WOLVERINE: Boy, that
rush hour traffic's
murder, isn't it?

04:44.333 --> 04:48.500
If your friend continues,
I fear for my people's lives
and ours as well.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.083
We must discover
a way to calm her,

04:51.083 --> 04:54.583
so we might have time
to undo Sauron's
ruinous influence.

04:54.583 --> 04:56.958
You wanna ask her
to roll up her sleeve?

04:56.958 --> 04:59.708
Y'all keep her distracted
while I absorb her powers.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.750
That'll slow her
down long enough.

05:01.750 --> 05:04.500
And have you messing up
the weather from here
to Barbados?

05:04.500 --> 05:06.458
I don't think so.

05:06.458 --> 05:09.583
It appears
we are caught between
Scylla and Charybdis,

05:09.583 --> 05:12.583
the proverbial rock
and a hard place.

05:12.583 --> 05:15.750
I can do it.
Fly me close enough

05:15.750 --> 05:18.166
and I can
absorb her energy.

05:18.166 --> 05:21.583
And become Sauron again?
No way!

05:21.583 --> 05:23.750
Do you think
I want to?

05:23.750 --> 05:27.458
He's a monster.
I hate all that he is.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.000
I believe him.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Had he wished to regain
Sauron's form,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.708
he could have used
any one of us.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.500
Please, I beg you.

05:35.500 --> 05:39.625
Allow me to set right
the evil Sauron has started.

05:39.625 --> 05:42.833
Our fighting Sauron
is preferable to this.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.625
I fear we have
no other choice.

05:44.625 --> 05:48.458
Hail! Ice! Rage on!

05:50.583 --> 05:53.708
Careful!
We just wanna
get her attention.

05:53.708 --> 05:56.708
With this wind,
it's a wonder we can
get them airborne.

05:56.708 --> 06:00.291
Winds, do not
let them stop me!

06:03.166 --> 06:06.583
Come on. Keep her busy
just a little longer.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.583
No!

06:09.583 --> 06:10.708
(SCREAMING)

06:13.458 --> 06:15.125
They did it!

06:15.125 --> 06:19.375
Lykos, release her before
you transform completely!

06:19.375 --> 06:23.625
LYKOS: Never!
Must have more.

06:25.625 --> 06:27.333
ROGUE: Got you.

06:27.333 --> 06:31.208
Sauron lives once more!

06:34.166 --> 06:36.458
Okay, bubba.

06:36.458 --> 06:40.333
Are you gonna help us
fix up Storm or am I gonna
have to take you out?

06:40.333 --> 06:41.375
(SCREAMING)

06:41.375 --> 06:42.708
Uh-uh.

06:42.708 --> 06:45.708
I wouldn't touch me
if I were you.

06:45.708 --> 06:48.625
(SCREAMING)

06:55.625 --> 06:59.458
This is not over,
outlander.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.375
JUBILEE:
What happened up there?

07:03.375 --> 07:05.083
It was real weird.

07:05.083 --> 07:08.375
I think our absorbing powers
canceled each other out.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.250
KAZAR: Let us bring them
back to the village.

07:36.833 --> 07:38.208
(DRUM BEATS)

07:42.458 --> 07:43.875
How's she doing?

07:43.875 --> 07:46.083
I've given her
a mild sedative.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.583
It should prevent her
from regaining
full consciousness

07:48.583 --> 07:51.833
and creating another
maelstrom, for a time.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.833
The Professor told me
how hard Storm works

07:53.833 --> 07:56.458
to keep her powers
under control.

07:56.458 --> 07:59.083
And I thought
my powers were a pain.

07:59.083 --> 08:04.000
When you and Sauron
connected, were you able
to read his thoughts?

08:04.000 --> 08:09.083
One word kept popping
in and out of my head,
"Zaladane."

08:09.083 --> 08:13.250
She has proclaimed herself
the High Priestess of Garokk.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.458
I wonder...

(DRUM BEATING)

08:18.333 --> 08:19.416
(MOANING)

08:24.166 --> 08:27.875
Don't worry, Storm,
we'll take care
of Sauron for you.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.458
Not Sauron.
Something else.

08:31.458 --> 08:34.458
Something very wrong.

08:34.458 --> 08:37.583
I sense nature
out of balance.

08:37.583 --> 08:41.375
An evil within the land
must be purged.

08:41.375 --> 08:45.208
This evil
must be destroyed!

08:53.958 --> 08:55.333
Stay back!

08:57.000 --> 09:00.083
Come on, sugar.
Let's get you
back to bed.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.458
I said stay back!

09:04.375 --> 09:07.583
JUBILEE: Storm,
what are you doing?
Hold on.

09:07.583 --> 09:10.125
Let me go!

09:10.125 --> 09:11.458
Quit struggling.

09:11.458 --> 09:14.083
Quickly. Constrain her.

09:18.708 --> 09:19.750
(GROANING)

09:25.708 --> 09:27.458
Crisis contained.

09:30.458 --> 09:33.583
Zaladane, rally my troops.

09:33.583 --> 09:37.458
The invaders must pay
for their insolence.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.458
Are you deaf, woman?
I order you.

09:40.458 --> 09:41.458
No.

09:41.458 --> 09:44.583
You refuse me?

09:44.583 --> 09:50.333
Lord Garokk has decreed
you have outlived
your usefulness.

09:50.333 --> 09:55.291
Lord Garokk is nothing
but a lifeless stone.

09:55.291 --> 09:59.125
Perhaps you need
some persuasion.

10:02.458 --> 10:03.500
(GASPS)

10:03.500 --> 10:05.875
What sorcery is this?

10:05.875 --> 10:11.500
GAROKK: This stone
is not as lifeless
as it appears, Sauron.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.958
You do not exist.

10:13.958 --> 10:18.500
GAROKK: Ah, but as you
can see, I do.

10:25.625 --> 10:31.166
In a bygone era,
I alone ruled this land

10:31.166 --> 10:35.083
until a powerful enemy
defeated me,

10:35.083 --> 10:39.291
calming the raging elements
of the Savage Land,

10:39.291 --> 10:45.083
leaving me powerless,
banished to this
rocky prison.

10:45.583 --> 10:49.958
I lay dormant for
thousands of years,

10:49.958 --> 10:55.125
remembered, worshiped,
yearned for.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.875
Until one day...

10:58.583 --> 11:03.708
MR. SINISTER: All I need
now is for you to contact
your students, Professor.

11:03.708 --> 11:05.333
Obey!

11:06.083 --> 11:09.166
XAVIER: Won't listen.
Can't listen.

11:09.583 --> 11:13.458
Can't allow you
to control my mind.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.583
Won't allow you to...

11:16.875 --> 11:18.375
(SCREAMS)

11:19.583 --> 11:22.500
If somebody
is holding Xavier,

11:22.500 --> 11:25.583
I'm gonna enjoy
making them let go.

11:33.583 --> 11:36.250
GAROKK: When a mutant
came to our valley

11:36.250 --> 11:39.958
and released
her elemental energy,

11:39.958 --> 11:45.583
I awoke,
weakened but alive.

11:47.291 --> 11:51.750
But to fully imbue
my life force into the land,

11:51.750 --> 11:57.708
I required Storm's power
at its total savage fury.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.208
My priestess sent you,
Karl Lykos,

12:05.208 --> 12:08.000
known as Sauron to her.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.833
It was no accident that
you were drawn to her.

12:13.833 --> 12:18.375
I gave you that yearning.

12:18.375 --> 12:23.583
Beneath the range
of volcanoes that
ring our hidden valley

12:23.583 --> 12:26.958
lies a source
of planetary power,

12:26.958 --> 12:30.166
the surging force
of molten magma

12:30.166 --> 12:34.500
that maintains
the Savage Land's
tropical climate.

12:34.500 --> 12:38.875
I intend to fuse
with that energy.

12:38.875 --> 12:42.583
Once I do,
no force on Earth

12:42.583 --> 12:46.458
will be able to
imprison me again.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.875
STORM: Restrain me,
I beg you!

12:49.875 --> 12:53.000
Do not let me
recover my strength.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.458
And I told you
to let loose
every now and again.

12:56.458 --> 12:57.875
Shows what I know.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.125
ROGUE: Now what?

13:05.125 --> 13:07.000
KAZAR: The land changes.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.458
GAROKK: Behold Garokk!

13:22.458 --> 13:25.750
Behold Garokk!

13:25.750 --> 13:29.583
Gaze upon my works
and tremble.

13:33.875 --> 13:38.416
Let the Age of Garokk
begin anew.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.416
If anyone's got a daring
last-minute rescue in mind,

13:48.416 --> 13:50.708
now would be the time.

13:50.708 --> 13:54.458
To put it in the vernacular,
alley-oop!

13:54.458 --> 13:56.458
What's with
the gray dirt?

13:57.583 --> 13:58.708
No!

13:58.708 --> 14:00.375
All right, stone-face,

14:00.375 --> 14:03.208
let's see how you stack up
to adamantium.

14:04.583 --> 14:07.875
Wow! You got some
rough shrubbery
around here, pal.

14:11.458 --> 14:13.458
Wolverine! Behind you!

14:16.000 --> 14:18.750
He's free,
corrupting the land.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.416
No! Get back!

14:24.625 --> 14:27.583
Let me breathe!

14:28.291 --> 14:30.125
No!

14:36.875 --> 14:39.708
Evil must be stopped!

14:49.750 --> 14:52.750
Not a real good idea
to make her mad.

14:52.750 --> 14:57.291
I summon the bitter
winter frost!

14:57.291 --> 15:01.708
You dare challenge
the will of Garokk?

15:10.958 --> 15:13.000
Curious.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.333
Garokk seems to be
directing himself toward
that mountain range.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.250
KAZAR: Those are
the volcanoes that
heat the Savage Land.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.375
-Oh, my!
-What is wrong?

15:21.375 --> 15:24.125
This is just
a hypothesis,
mind you,

15:24.125 --> 15:26.416
but based on what
I've observed,

15:26.416 --> 15:30.000
if Garokk absorbs
the energy of those
geothermal pits,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.708
he could become
supremely powerful.

15:32.708 --> 15:36.291
And this entire land
would be frozen solid.

15:36.291 --> 15:39.708
What are you talking about?
I'm sweating like a pig here.

15:39.708 --> 15:42.208
I believe Storm
is responsible.

15:42.208 --> 15:45.708
If cold will not
slow you, Garokk,

15:45.708 --> 15:48.708
then perhaps
heat will.

15:48.708 --> 15:53.708
Is this the limit
of your power,
weather witch?

15:53.708 --> 15:56.166
Foolish creature!

15:56.166 --> 16:00.750
Your pitiful efforts
merely empower me.

16:01.500 --> 16:05.708
I summon the full force
of the elements!

16:07.958 --> 16:10.708
BEAST: I believe
Storm's attacks
of meteorologic energy

16:10.708 --> 16:12.708
are actually
strengthening Garokk.

16:12.708 --> 16:15.000
We gotta stop her
helping him.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.750
Storm, this is Beast.
Cease and desist,
I implore you.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.583
Your efforts only
exacerbate the situation.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.000
Leave me alone!

16:28.458 --> 16:29.583
(GRUNTING)

16:29.583 --> 16:33.625

(GRUNTS)

17:11.000 --> 17:13.250
I awaken.

17:13.708 --> 17:19.500
Soon, the entire
Savage Land will know
the will of Garokk.

17:19.500 --> 17:24.958
The power of the Earth
shall be mine!

17:26.375 --> 17:31.333
Silence! Sauron,
and Sauron alone,

17:31.333 --> 17:34.708
will rule the Savage Land.

17:34.708 --> 17:39.875
I will absorb every ounce
of energy you possess.

17:39.875 --> 17:45.583
I can feel it, building,
flowing through me.

17:46.583 --> 17:49.875
No! It is too much!

17:51.958 --> 17:55.750
What is happening to me?

17:57.958 --> 18:00.000
No!

18:01.833 --> 18:05.625
No one challenges
Sauron and lives!

18:19.833 --> 18:23.750
This evil must
be destroyed!

18:24.750 --> 18:27.208
Storm! Get away
from there!

18:28.875 --> 18:29.875
(STORM GROANING)

18:47.416 --> 18:49.208
(SCREECHING)

18:57.333 --> 18:59.583
BEAST: Storm! Rogue!

18:59.583 --> 19:00.583
JUBILEE: Where are you?

19:02.250 --> 19:03.875
Storm!

19:04.583 --> 19:06.583
JUBILEE: Somebody
say something!

19:06.583 --> 19:08.000
BEAST: Rogue!

19:15.458 --> 19:17.458
Rogue! Storm!

19:17.458 --> 19:20.458
I'm afraid we may be
too late, my friend.

19:21.583 --> 19:24.500
Over here, boys.
Help me with Storm.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.416
She is unconscious,
but alive.

19:29.416 --> 19:32.250
We must get her to
the medical facilities
on the Blackbird.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.750
GAROKK: I was so close.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.625
You are safe now,
Karl Lykos.

19:57.625 --> 20:01.625
The nightmare is over.
And with no mutant energy
to tempt you,

20:01.625 --> 20:04.708
the presence of Sauron
will haunt you no more.

20:04.708 --> 20:06.583
Thank you, my friend.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.708
About my behavior
back there,

20:12.708 --> 20:14.958
how can I ask you
to forgive me?

20:14.958 --> 20:17.750
Hush, now.
You need to rest.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.458
I am frightened, Rogue.

20:19.458 --> 20:22.583
Listen, sugar,
that wasn't you out there.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.000
Don't forget,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.125
Sauron messed
with my head, too.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.250
Thank you for
your understanding.

20:28.708 --> 20:31.875
All these years of
caution and denial,

20:31.875 --> 20:35.750
to finally unleash
my true feelings.

20:35.750 --> 20:38.125
I liked letting go.

20:38.125 --> 20:43.083
Never before
have I felt so free.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.500
