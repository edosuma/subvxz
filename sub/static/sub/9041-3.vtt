00:32.667 --> 00:34.700
MAYBE SOMETIME WE PLAY BOCCE,

00:34.700 --> 00:36.600
- YEAH, GREAT.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.333
SO HOW DO YOU LIKE
LIVIN' IN AMERICA?

00:38.333 --> 00:40.300
HOW'S THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS?

00:40.300 --> 00:41.767
- AH, IT'S NOT LIKE HOME.

00:41.767 --> 00:45.467
EVERYBODY, THEY STEAL HERE.
ALL THE TIME.

00:45.467 --> 00:47.433
- THEY DON'T STEAL IN ITALY?

00:47.433 --> 00:51.967
- IN ITALY,
THEY STEAL ONLY ONCE.

00:51.967 --> 00:53.733
- YOU WANT A BEER?

00:53.733 --> 00:55.200
- IS YOUR WIFE HERE?

00:55.200 --> 00:57.833
- YEAH, BUT SHE
WON'T BOTHER US.

00:57.833 --> 00:59.267
SIT DOWN.
OPEN YOUR PANTS.

01:01.167 --> 01:03.433

01:03.433 --> 01:06.767
HELLO, MARCO.
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.000
- BUON GIORNO.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.467
- YEAH, BUON GIORNO.

01:09.467 --> 01:11.867
THAT'S ITALIAN
FOR "BEER, MARIE!"

01:11.867 --> 01:14.567
- RIGHT AWAY, FRANK.

01:14.567 --> 01:16.533
WOULD YOU LIKE IT
IN A BOTTLE OVER YOUR HEAD

01:16.533 --> 01:19.067
OR IN A CAN SOMEWHERE ELSE?

01:19.067 --> 01:22.733
- SCUSA, MARIE,
BUT I COME TO SEE YOU.

01:22.733 --> 01:23.833
- REALLY?

01:23.833 --> 01:25.133
- MY DAUGHTER STEFANIA SAYS

01:25.133 --> 01:26.767
YOU'RE A GREAT TEACHER
OF PIANO.

01:26.767 --> 01:30.633
WITH RESPECT,
I ASK YOU FOR FAVOR.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.733
COULD YOU TEACH ME?

01:32.733 --> 01:34.100
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

01:34.100 --> 01:37.433
- MY MOTHER, ALL HER LIFE,
SHE LOVES MUSIC.

01:37.433 --> 01:39.500
SHE ALWAYS WANTS ME
TO PLAY.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.700
BUT THEN WHEN SHE GETS SICK,
I PROMISE HER TO LEARN...

01:42.700 --> 01:44.700
THEN SHE DIE.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.100
- OH...

01:46.100 --> 01:48.400
- SO YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.

01:50.467 --> 01:52.067
- FRANK!

01:52.067 --> 01:55.500
THAT IS THE SWEETEST THING
I HAVE EVER HEARD, MARCO.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.400
- BUT IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.167
I'M AFRAID NOW,
MAYBE I'M TOO OLD.

01:59.167 --> 02:02.767
- OH, NO, YOU'RE NEVER TOO OLD
TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOUR MOTHER.

02:02.767 --> 02:04.867
COME ON,
I'LL TEACH YOU RIGHT NOW.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.100
- NOW?

02:06.100 --> 02:09.867
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A BEER HERE!

02:09.867 --> 02:11.433
- BEER?

02:11.433 --> 02:16.767
HERE IS A MAN WHO THIRSTS
FOR SOMETHING MORE THAN ALCOHOL.

02:16.767 --> 02:20.533
HERE'S A MAN WHO WANTS
MUSIC IN HIS LIFE.

02:23.567 --> 02:26.333
- I COULD USE A LITTLE MUSIC
IN MY LIFE.

02:26.333 --> 02:28.600
THE SWEET SOUND
OF THE WHITE COATS

02:28.600 --> 02:31.400
COMING TO TAKE YOU OFF
TO THE NUT FARM.

02:33.367 --> 02:37.333
- ANOTHER SEASON
OF "EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND."

02:38.633 --> 02:41.067
- [growling]

02:51.067 --> 02:52.300
- HA, HA, HA.

03:06.267 --> 03:07.767
- CAN'T KICK IT 55 YARDS.

03:07.767 --> 03:08.933
JUST GO FOR IT.

03:08.933 --> 03:10.000
- OH, NO, HE CAN MAKE THIS.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.533
- IT'S GOOD.

03:11.533 --> 03:12.733
- HE GOT IT. I CAN'T--

03:12.733 --> 03:13.733
- YOU GOTTA BELIEVE!

03:13.733 --> 03:15.067
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

03:15.067 --> 03:16.367
- HEY, YOU'RE GONNA
WAKE THE KIDS.

03:16.367 --> 03:18.000
BE QUIET.
KEEP IT DOWN.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.500
- YOU GOTTA BELIEVE.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.067
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE JETS ARE GOING TO WIN.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.933
- HEY, DAD,
THE JETS JUST TIED IT!

03:26.933 --> 03:28.100
- GIVE IT UP, PAPA!

03:28.100 --> 03:30.067
- GET AWAY FROM ME,
YA MORON.

03:32.133 --> 03:33.333
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

03:33.333 --> 03:34.833
- THE JETS, MAN.
THEY TIED THE GAME.

03:34.833 --> 03:36.167
- WOULD YOU CAN IT?

03:36.167 --> 03:38.100
I'M TRYING TO WATCH
THE GAME HERE.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.300
CHIPS, DEBRA!

03:40.300 --> 03:42.600
- HEY, DAD,
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE LIKE THAT,

03:42.600 --> 03:45.167
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO WATCH
THE GAME AT YOUR OWN HOUSE?

03:45.167 --> 03:46.767
- I CAN'T.

03:46.767 --> 03:50.100
YOUR MOTHER'S GIVING MARCO
ANOTHER PIANO LESSON.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.267
- DIDN'T HE HAVE ONE
YESTERDAY?

03:52.267 --> 03:54.000
- EVERY DAY...

03:54.000 --> 03:56.833
FOR TWO WEEKS NOW.

03:56.833 --> 03:58.233
- MARCO?

03:58.233 --> 04:00.100
THE ONLY THING I SEE
THAT GUY PLAYING

04:00.100 --> 04:02.100
IS THE ORGAN
IN A HAUNTED HOUSE.

04:02.100 --> 04:05.233
- [chuckles]

04:05.233 --> 04:06.500
- THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.400
- IT'S NOT JUST
THE LESSONS ANYMORE.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.000
THEY'RE HANGING OUT NOW.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
THEY'RE FRIENDS.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.833
- [sarcastically]
CHIPS, FRANK.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.433
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, FRIENDS?

04:18.433 --> 04:20.633
- THEY'RE TOGETHER
ALL THE TIME PLAYING PIANO,

04:20.633 --> 04:21.833
SWAPPIN' RECIPES.

04:21.833 --> 04:24.667
SOMETIMES THEY SIT
AND LISTEN TO OPERA...

04:24.667 --> 04:27.500
AND CRY!

04:27.500 --> 04:30.267
- SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS BOTHERING
YOU A LITTLE BIT, FRANK.

04:30.267 --> 04:32.900
- OPERA, JUST WHAT
THE WORLD NEEDS...

04:32.900 --> 04:35.367
MORE FAT WOMEN SCREAMING.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.433
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

04:43.433 --> 04:47.033
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE
A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS, FRANK.

04:47.033 --> 04:48.067
- SHUT UP.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.500
- [laughing]

04:49.500 --> 04:51.133
[baby talk] ARE YOU
A LITTLE JEALOUS, FRANKIE?

04:51.133 --> 04:52.433
ARE YOU JUST
A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS?

04:52.433 --> 04:54.033
- NO, DON'T DO THAT, HONEY.

04:54.033 --> 04:55.633
- YEAH, CAREFUL.
WATCH YOUR FINGER.

04:55.633 --> 04:58.333
- ALL RIGHT!

04:58.333 --> 05:00.333
SO I'M A LITTLE JEALOUS!

05:00.333 --> 05:02.633
HE SHOULDN'T BE WITH HER!

05:02.633 --> 05:04.700
HE SHOULD BE WITH ME!

05:09.233 --> 05:10.900
- WHAT?
- HUH?

05:10.900 --> 05:12.500
- HE WAS MY FRIEND FIRST!

05:12.500 --> 05:15.100
WE PLAYED BOCCE IN ITALY.

05:15.100 --> 05:19.933
NOW HE COMES IN THE DOOR--
IT'S LIKE I DON'T EXIST.

05:19.933 --> 05:21.567
- OH, CHEER UP, DAD.

05:21.567 --> 05:26.100
I'M SURE THERE'S A GUY
OUT THERE FOR YOU SOMEWHERE.

05:26.100 --> 05:30.333
- YEAH, MAYBE MARCO
HAS A BROTHER...

05:30.333 --> 05:32.800
IN THE BELL TOWER.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.967
- I WANT HIM OUT OF MY HOUSE.

05:37.967 --> 05:39.467
- SO THROW HIM OUT.

05:39.467 --> 05:42.000
- RAY, LET YOUR PARENTS
WORK THIS OUT FOR THEMSELVES.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.367
- I'M JUST SAYING, YOU WANT
SOMEONE OUT OF YOUR HOUSE,

05:44.367 --> 05:45.500
YOU THROW 'EM OUT.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.767
- YEAH, YOU'RE THE EXPERT.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.200
- YOU, OUT!

05:51.200 --> 05:53.367
I'M KIDDING.
YOU STAY.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.633
- HEY, HE CAN'T JUST
THROW HIM OUT.

05:56.633 --> 05:58.700
I MEAN, MARCO'S NOT
THE KIND OF GUY YOU MESS WITH.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.200
- MARCO?

06:00.200 --> 06:02.667
THAT GUY'S NO BIGGER
THAN A BAG OF LAUNDRY.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.500
- REMEMBER WHEN HE TOOK OVER
NEMO'S PIZZA?

06:04.500 --> 06:06.333
AND I SAID,
"WHAT HAPPENED TO NEMO?"

06:06.333 --> 06:08.900
AND HE LOOKED AT ME
WITH THAT FACE AND SAID,

06:08.900 --> 06:11.500
"HE GO AWAY."

06:13.500 --> 06:15.167
HAS ANYBODY SEEN
NEMO SINCE?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.233
HUH?
POSTCARD?

06:16.233 --> 06:17.400
ANYTHING?
NO.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.067
MARCO KNOWS HOW
TO MAKE PEOPLE GO AWAY,

06:19.067 --> 06:22.433
AND THAT'S ALL
I'M SAYING.

06:22.433 --> 06:24.867
- HE DON'T SCARE ME,
AND I'M THROWING HIM OUT!

06:24.867 --> 06:26.200
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE, FRANK.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.933
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL MARCO HOW YOU FEEL?

06:27.933 --> 06:30.067
THAT YOU WANT TO BE
HIS FRIEND TOO.

06:30.067 --> 06:33.233
- WHAT AM I, WEARING A SKIRT
AND MARY JANES?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.967
I'M THROWIN' HIM OUT!

06:37.967 --> 06:40.667
- SAY HI TO NEMO FOR US.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.333
- AND STAY OUT!

06:51.167 --> 06:53.600
[piano notes plinking]

07:00.133 --> 07:03.200

07:03.200 --> 07:05.933

DON'T SMASH YOUR FINGERS.

07:05.933 --> 07:07.833
YOUR FINGERS ARE YOUR TOOLS.

07:07.833 --> 07:10.000
- I AM [speaking Italian ].

07:10.000 --> 07:13.500
I'M A STINKY CODFISH.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.300
- YOU'RE NOT
A STINKY CODFISH.

07:16.300 --> 07:19.400
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY
WHO LOVES HIS MOTHER.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.200
BUT COME ON,
YOU ONLY HAVE A WEEK

07:21.200 --> 07:23.567
TO LEARN THIS
BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY PARTY.

07:23.567 --> 07:26.733
- YOU SHOULD HAVE GREAT
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY, NOT ME.

07:26.733 --> 07:29.300
- NONSENSE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE WONDERFUL.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.733
BUT KEEP PRACTICING,

07:30.733 --> 07:32.300
AND THEN LATER,
WE'LL MAKE BISCOTTI.

07:32.300 --> 07:35.000
- I LIKE YOUR BISCOTTI.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.200
- I'LL GO MAKE US
SOME TEA.

07:39.933 --> 07:42.833

SIT!

08:01.400 --> 08:02.667
I CANNOT HELP

EVERY TIME I HAVE A LESSON,

08:05.100 --> 08:06.333
IT'S RUDE.

08:06.333 --> 08:08.667
- I'M SORRY.

08:11.733 --> 08:14.600
- NO, IT IS RUDE OF ME
TO INVADE YOUR HOUSE

08:14.600 --> 08:18.167
AND TAKE YOU AWAY
FROM YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE.

08:18.167 --> 08:20.267
- MY WHAT?

08:24.967 --> 08:26.500
- FORGIVE ME.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.900
YOU OPEN YOUR HOUSE TO ME,

08:28.900 --> 08:32.233
AND I STINK IT UP.

08:32.233 --> 08:35.767
- OH, HEY, HEY,
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL.

08:35.767 --> 08:38.100
- YOU ARE TOO KIND.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.767
NOW, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO SAY TO ME?

08:39.767 --> 08:42.700
- UH...

08:42.700 --> 08:45.133
YOU PLAY POKER?

08:45.133 --> 08:48.000
- I'M GOOD AT POKER.

08:49.233 --> 08:51.633

AT MY LODGE TONIGHT.

08:51.633 --> 08:52.700

09:03.467 --> 09:05.600

HIS LESSON YET.

09:05.600 --> 09:09.200
- MARIE, I'M DONE
WITH PIANO.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.633
I TRIED,

09:13.833 --> 09:17.367
YOU CAN'T QUIT.
YOU PROMISED YOUR MOTHER.

I KNOW, BUT...

09:20.767 --> 09:22.600
SHE'S DEAD.

THE LODGE, MARCO.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.533
THEY GOT CARDS, CHECKERS,

09:45.533 --> 09:48.167
IT'S GREAT.
EVERYBODY SWIMS NAKED.

DON'T.

10:45.367 --> 10:47.600
- MARCO IS MY FRIEND.
NOW I NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.300
HE'S ALWAYS WITH YOUR FATHER.

10:49.300 --> 10:53.533
THEY'RE WATCHING SPORTS
OR SWIMMING NUDE AT THE LODGE.

10:53.533 --> 10:57.133
- THERE ISN'T ENOUGH
CHLORINE IN THE WORLD.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.000
- I MEAN, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I HAD A REAL COMPANION,

11:04.000 --> 11:05.167
SOMEONE I COULD TALK TO.

11:05.167 --> 11:06.800
DO SOMETHING, RAYMOND.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.900
- ME?
WHAT?

11:07.900 --> 11:09.333
- TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

11:09.333 --> 11:13.133
- NO, NO, STICK TO THE PLAN
WHERE YOU KILL HIM.

11:13.133 --> 11:15.333
- TELL HIM TO LEAVE
MARCO ALONE.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.467
- MA, I DON'T WANT TO GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

11:17.467 --> 11:19.000
- I DON'T WANT YOU
IN THE MIDDLE.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.733
I WANT YOU ON MY SIDE.

11:20.733 --> 11:22.400
- NO, LOOK, MOM,
I THINK YOU AND DAD

11:22.400 --> 11:24.467
CAN WORK THIS OUT YOURSELVES,
RIGHT, DEB?

11:24.467 --> 11:25.700
- NO, RAY.

11:25.700 --> 11:28.233
TELL YOUR FATHER TO
GIVE HER BACK HER FRIEND.

11:28.233 --> 11:31.033
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO "STAY OUT OF IT"?

11:31.033 --> 11:32.967
- I FEEL FOR YOUR MOTHER.

11:32.967 --> 11:35.367
- YOU DO?
- YES.

11:35.367 --> 11:36.600
- DO YOU THINK IT'S EASY

11:36.600 --> 11:38.333
FOR MARIE TO MEET PEOPLE
AND MAKE FRIENDS

11:38.333 --> 11:39.600
WHEN SHE SPENT
HER WHOLE LIFE

11:39.600 --> 11:41.433
STUCK IN A HOUSE
WITH A LUMP OF A HUSBAND

11:41.433 --> 11:43.100
WHO, INSTEAD OF PUTTIN'
HIS OWN KIDS TO BED,

11:43.100 --> 11:47.200
IS ON THE PHONE WITH HIS PALS
MAKIN' A GOLF DATE?

11:49.533 --> 11:53.467
- WHY CAN'T YOU JUST HATE
ONE MAN A TIME?

11:55.367 --> 11:56.433
- HEY, MARIE,
TICK-TOCK.

11:56.433 --> 11:59.033
WHERE'S MY DINNER?

12:00.733 --> 12:03.567
- RAYMOND HAS SOMETHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

12:03.567 --> 12:04.800
- WHAT?

12:04.800 --> 12:06.333
- [mumbling]
WHAT...

12:06.333 --> 12:08.600
- STAY AWAY FROM MARCO.
- YEAH.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.467
- SINCE WHEN DO YOU
TELL ME WHAT TO DO?

12:18.467 --> 12:20.933
- I'M NOT--I'M NOT TALKING.
THEY ARE.

12:20.933 --> 12:23.067
- MARCO WAS MY FRIEND.

12:23.067 --> 12:25.333
- OH, YEAH?
HE TRADED UP.

12:28.667 --> 12:30.267
- THAT'S IT, FRANK.
THAT'S IT.

12:30.267 --> 12:32.567
YOU ARE NOT INVITED
TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY.

12:32.567 --> 12:35.567
- WHO NEEDS AN INVITATION?
IT'S AT MY HOUSE!

12:35.567 --> 12:36.967
- NOT ANYMORE!

12:36.967 --> 12:39.033
I'M GONNA HAVE IT RIGHT HERE
AT RAYMOND'S HOUSE.

12:39.033 --> 12:41.200
- THANKS A LOT!
- WHAT DID I DO?

12:41.200 --> 12:42.600
- FORGET IT!

12:42.600 --> 12:44.467
I'LL JUST GO TO THE LODGE
WITH MARCO.

12:44.467 --> 12:46.833
- YOU CAN'T; I'VE ALREADY
INVITED HIM TO THE PARTY,

12:46.833 --> 12:49.767
AND HE'S GONNA PLAY "HAPPY
BIRTHDAY" TO ME ON THE PIANO.

12:49.767 --> 12:53.933
- WHERE'S MY DINNER?

12:53.933 --> 12:55.700
- AT THE LODGE.

13:01.300 --> 13:04.133
- NEXT TIME,
YOU MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!

13:06.767 --> 13:08.400
[door slams]

13:11.467 --> 13:12.667
- WHAT?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.433
- YOU'RE REALLY WITH
MY MOTHER ON THIS, HUH?

13:14.433 --> 13:17.333
THAT'S THE HORSE
YOU'RE BACKIN'?

13:17.333 --> 13:20.633
- BETTER MY HORSE
THAN YOUR JACKASS.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.233
- HEY, MY JACKASS
HAPPENS TO HAVE A POINT, OKAY?

13:23.233 --> 13:24.700
HE'S RIGHT.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.167
IF MARCO'S
GONNA BE WITH ANYBODY,

13:26.167 --> 13:27.833
IT SHOULD BE HIM, NOT HER.

13:27.833 --> 13:30.000
- WHAT, YOUR MOTHER'S
NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A FRIEND?

13:30.000 --> 13:33.467
- NOT A MALE FRIEND, NO.
SHE'S MY MOTHER.

13:33.467 --> 13:34.400
- SO?

13:34.400 --> 13:36.133
- SO SHE'S A MARRIED WOMAN.

13:36.133 --> 13:37.833
IT'S CREEPY.

13:37.833 --> 13:41.867
- SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT
I CAN'T HAVE ANY MALE FRIENDS?

13:41.867 --> 13:44.200
- YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY
MALE FRIENDS AS YOU WANT,

13:44.200 --> 13:47.367
AS LONG AS THEY'RE ALL GAY.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.700
- YOU KNOW, RAY, I MAY HAVE
SOME PROBLEMS WITH YOUR MOTHER,

13:53.700 --> 13:55.567
BUT SHE CAN BE FRIENDS
WITH WHOEVER SHE WANTS,

13:55.567 --> 13:58.067
AND I'M GONNA DO
WHATEVER I CAN TO ENCOURAGE HER.

13:58.067 --> 13:59.433
- ALL RIGHT, FINE!

13:59.433 --> 14:03.600
BUT FROM NOW ON IN MY HEAD,
MARCO'S GAY.

14:09.467 --> 14:11.033
[doorbell rings]

14:11.033 --> 14:12.367
- OH.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.833
MARCO.

14:16.833 --> 14:19.167
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MARIE.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.400
- THIS IS MY COUSIN GINA

14:22.400 --> 14:24.500
AND MY NEPHEW GERARD.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.967
AND THIS MY DEAR FRIEND
MARCO FOGANOLO.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.100
I FOUND HIM IN ITALY.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.467
- HOW DO YOU DO?

14:33.467 --> 14:36.267
- ISN'T HE DELIGHTFUL?

14:36.267 --> 14:39.133
- HE LOOKS SO AUTHENTIC.

14:39.133 --> 14:42.967
- I NEVER MET AN ITALIAN
FROM ITALY BEFORE.

14:42.967 --> 14:46.600
[slowly]
HELLO...

14:52.733 --> 14:54.233
- WHERE'S FRANK?

14:54.233 --> 14:55.767
- OH, FRANK'S NOT COMING.

14:55.767 --> 14:56.867
- WHY NOT?

14:56.867 --> 15:00.467
- HE'S SICK--
SWINE FLU.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.967
- COME ON, RAY, ARE YOU GONNA
SIT THERE ALL DAY?

15:02.967 --> 15:04.167
JUST JOIN THE PARTY.

15:04.167 --> 15:06.367
- NO, NO.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

15:06.367 --> 15:10.067
MY MOM AND HER...
BOYFRIEND.

15:10.067 --> 15:11.633
- I THOUGHT YOU MADE HIM GAY.

15:11.633 --> 15:15.800
- YEAH, WELL, I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS THAT.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.567
NO, I MEAN, COME ON,
MY DAD SHOULD BE HERE.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.767
- HMM, WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU MISS THE MOST--

15:20.767 --> 15:23.333
THE BURPING,
THE FINGER IN THE FROSTING,

15:23.333 --> 15:26.067
HIS WIPING HIS MOUTH
ON THE CURTAINS?

15:26.067 --> 15:30.633
- IF YOU MUST KNOW, I MISS
THE SHIRTTAIL OUT THE FLY.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.633
- AAAARH! COME ON!

15:36.633 --> 15:38.700
[groaning]

15:42.367 --> 15:45.267
- BE CAREFUL, ROBERT,
YOU'LL SCRATCH THE FINISH.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.500
- MA.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.467
MA, WHY IS YOUR PIANO
COMIN' INTO MY HOUSE?

15:50.467 --> 15:51.833
- OH, IT'S FOR THE PARTY.

15:51.833 --> 15:53.667
MARCO'S GONNA PLAY ME
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY."

15:53.667 --> 15:56.000
- UHHH!

15:57.333 --> 15:59.500
THANKS, EVERYBODY.
I GOT IT.

16:01.933 --> 16:05.100
YEOW!
OOH! GAW!

16:06.067 --> 16:10.367
OOOOH!

16:10.367 --> 16:12.333
OH!

16:12.333 --> 16:15.467
- IS IT YOUR BACK?

16:18.833 --> 16:24.000
- NO.
I'M FROM JAPAN.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.767
I BRING GREETINGS
FROM THE EMPEROR.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.300
- RAY, GET HIM SOME ICE.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.000
- FABULOUS PARTY.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.133
- AAH!

16:43.133 --> 16:45.000
WHAT ARE YOU--

16:45.000 --> 16:46.267
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?

16:46.267 --> 16:47.600
- THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.733
- HOW LONG YOU BEEN
HIDING IN THERE?

16:49.733 --> 16:54.433
- LONG ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
COULD USE SOME NEW UNDERWEAR.

16:54.433 --> 16:59.700
- YEAH, WELL,
I COULD USE SOME NOW.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.533
- GET MARCO IN HERE.
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.867
- RAY,
WHERE'S THE--

17:04.867 --> 17:06.433
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:06.433 --> 17:08.433
- BURPING.

17:08.433 --> 17:12.733
NOW MAYBE I'LL WIPE MY MOUTH
ON THE CURTAIN.

17:12.733 --> 17:16.667
- UHH, UHH,
UHH, UHH, UHH, UHH...

17:16.667 --> 17:17.833
- AW, COME ON.

17:17.833 --> 17:22.800
IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S A GRAND PIANO.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.567
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:24.567 --> 17:27.000
- I'M JUST STOPPING BY
TO SEE IF MY FRIEND MARCO

17:27.000 --> 17:28.667
WANTS TO PLAY SOME BOCCE.

17:28.667 --> 17:31.367
- WELL, HE DOESN'T,
BECAUSE HE'S HERE FOR ME.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.200
- WELL, HE'D RATHER BE WITH ME.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.533
HE LIKES ME BETTER.

17:34.533 --> 17:37.300
- HA!
NOBODY LIKES YOU BETTER.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.400
- OH, YEAH?
LET'S ASK HIM.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.100
- OH, YOU CAN'T
DO THAT, FRANK.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.600
- WELL, WHY NOT?
BRING HIM IN HERE.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.233
- HEY, MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
- YOU SCARED?

17:45.233 --> 17:47.533
- FRANK, YOU ARE RUINING
MY BIRTHDAY PARTY!

17:47.533 --> 17:49.367
- YOU'VE RUINED
EVERYTHING ELSE!

17:49.367 --> 17:50.500
MARCO!

17:50.500 --> 17:52.867
- EXCUSE ME,
HOW'S THAT ICE COMING?

17:52.867 --> 17:56.800
- ALL RIGHT, ROBERT.
JEEZ.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.600
- HEY, MARCO.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.667
WHOSE FRIEND
DO YOU WANT TO BE?

18:00.667 --> 18:03.400
- FRANK, I THOUGHT
YOU HAD THE SWINE FLU.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.900
- SHE TOLD YOU THAT?

18:04.900 --> 18:07.533
YOU WILL STOP AT NOTHING.

18:07.533 --> 18:09.133
WHO DO YOU WANT
TO STICK WITH,

18:09.133 --> 18:10.667
ME OR THE LIAR?

18:12.200 --> 18:14.867
- YOU WANT ME
TO CHOOSE?

18:14.867 --> 18:16.200
- THAT'S RIGHT.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.500
SHE THINKS
YOU LIKE HER BETTER

18:17.500 --> 18:19.100
AND WANT TO BE HER FRIEND.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.633
- WHY SHOULDN'T HE
BE HER FRIEND?

18:20.633 --> 18:21.867
THEY ENJOY EACH OTHER.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.600
- SURE, NOW,

18:23.600 --> 18:25.667
BUT HE'S GONNA FIND
IT'S A QUICK TRIP TO NAGVILLE.

18:28.167 --> 18:29.600
AM I WRONG?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.600
IT'S ALREADY STARTED
WITH THE PIANO LESSONS.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.800
YOU SAID YOURSELF

18:32.800 --> 18:34.400
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO PLAY PIANO ANYMORE.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.633
- SOMEBODY COULD HAVE TOLD ME.

18:41.967 --> 18:44.100
- WHY CAN'T I BE
BOTH YOUR FRIENDS?

18:44.100 --> 18:45.233
- WELL, FOR ONE THING,

18:45.233 --> 18:46.467
I FIND THAT PEOPLE
WHO LIKE ME

18:46.467 --> 18:49.933
GENERALLY CAN'T STAND HIM.

18:49.933 --> 18:51.133
- MA, I DON'T GET THIS,

18:51.133 --> 18:52.400
THERE'S GOT TO BE
PLENTY OF LADIES

18:52.400 --> 18:53.900
YOU CAN BE FRIENDS
WITH OUT THERE.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.800
HIT THE BINGO CIRCUIT.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.633
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

18:58.633 --> 19:02.767
THERE'S ENOUGH NAKED, WRINKLY
OLD MEN AT THE LODGE FOR HIM.

19:02.767 --> 19:07.033
- PLEASE, I'M ALREADY
IN THE VOMITING POSITION.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.733
- SO PICK ALREADY.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.567
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

19:12.567 --> 19:13.933
THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

19:13.933 --> 19:16.433
THIS IS NOT
A HUSBAND AND WIFE.

19:16.433 --> 19:20.767
BEFORE MY WIFE DIED,
WE WERE FRIENDS.

19:25.933 --> 19:28.400
- ARE YOU GONNA PICK OR NOT?

19:33.767 --> 19:35.333
- THIS IS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT?

19:37.133 --> 19:40.533
I CHOOSE FRANK.

19:40.533 --> 19:42.233
- YES.

19:47.767 --> 19:48.933
- I'M SORRY.

19:48.933 --> 19:50.867
- NO, LISTEN,
I UNDERSTAND.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.433
- I DID NOT WANT TO CHOOSE.

19:52.433 --> 19:54.267
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN, MARCO.

19:54.267 --> 19:56.567
WHY DON'T WE ALL
HAVE SOME CAKE?

20:01.433 --> 20:03.300
- HEY, MARIE,
WAIT A SECOND.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.167
YOU TAKE HIM.

20:11.167 --> 20:12.900
- NO, THAT'S OKAY, FRANK.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.667
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
YOU KEEP HIM.

20:18.867 --> 20:21.800
- NO, I DON'T WANT HIM ANYMORE.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.200
- I WANT YOU TWO GUYS
TO GO AND HAVE FUN.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.600
GO TO THE LODGE.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.333
- NAH, I GOT PLENTY OF FRIENDS
AT THE LODGE,

20:28.333 --> 20:32.133
SO, UH...YOU TAKE HIM.

20:32.133 --> 20:34.400
- FRANK, I DON'T WANT HIM
ALL THE TIME.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.400
CAN'T YOU TAKE HIM
SOME OF THE TIME?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.800
- SO NOW YOU'RE
STICKING ME WITH HIM?

20:39.800 --> 20:43.033
- THIS IS SO TYPICAL OF YOU.

20:44.633 --> 20:46.633
- HEY.
CAKE!

20:48.800 --> 20:52.067
- ALL RIGHT, SO YOU SHOULD PLAY
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY" ON THE PIANO.

20:52.067 --> 20:56.000
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA PLAY
A DIRTY VERSION, THOUGH.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.533
[singing] TINY BUTT DAY TO YOU

21:00.400 --> 21:02.233
- REJECTED BY BOTH OF THEM.

21:02.233 --> 21:05.400
BOY, I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.933
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MARCO.
LET IT OUT.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.467
LET IT ALL OUT.

21:14.567 --> 21:16.067
THAT'S IT.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.100
- SO THAT WAS A GOOD PARTY.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.467
- WHAT? HOW WAS THAT GOOD
FOR YOUR MOTHER?

21:25.467 --> 21:27.100
YOU GUYS MADE HER
LOSE A FRIEND.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.767
- AW, COME ON.
DON'T START.

21:28.767 --> 21:31.267
- LISTEN, RAY,
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

21:31.267 --> 21:33.000
IF I MEET SOMEBODY
AND I WANT TO BE THEIR FRIEND,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.700
I'M NOT GONNA TOLERATE
ANY OF YOUR CAVEMAN CRAP.

21:35.700 --> 21:38.333
I DON'T CARE WHAT SEX THEY ARE;
A FRIEND IS A FRIEND,

21:38.333 --> 21:40.800
AND I CAN BE FRIENDS
WITH WHOEVER I WANT.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.600
[doorbell rings]

21:44.700 --> 21:47.233
- HELLO. I AM LOOKING
FOR MY FATHER.

21:47.233 --> 21:48.667
HE IS HERE?
