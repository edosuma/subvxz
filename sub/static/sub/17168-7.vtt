00:00.767 --> 00:02.668
(opening theme playing)

00:21.254 --> 00:22.354
Beast boy: <i> Summertime...</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.389
(inhales) <i> ah...</i>

00:24.391 --> 00:26.124
<i>It comes and goes.</i>

00:26.126 --> 00:27.259
<i>But last summer was...</i>

00:27.261 --> 00:30.429
(reading)

00:30.431 --> 00:33.065
<i>And that magical time</i>
<i>at the lake,</i>

00:33.067 --> 00:36.034
<i>We thought summer</i>
<i>would last forever.</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:38.670
<i>And in some ways, it has.</i>

00:50.416 --> 00:51.783
<i>But when robin died,</i>

00:51.785 --> 00:54.353
<i>We realized that time</i>
<i>doesn't stop...</i>

00:54.355 --> 00:55.954
<i>Not even for love.</i>

00:55.956 --> 00:57.289
Hey, I'm not dead.

00:57.291 --> 01:00.125
Shh, I'm giving our summer
some emotional depth, yo.

01:00.127 --> 01:02.094
(clears throat)

01:02.096 --> 01:04.696
Beast boy: <i> At the funeral,</i>
<i>we learned that summer</i>
<i>was temporary.</i>

01:04.698 --> 01:07.132
<i>But those moments</i>
<i>we shared were eternal.</i>

01:08.568 --> 01:11.002
Enough! I am not dead!

01:11.004 --> 01:12.471
And summer is over.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.306
And you know what that means.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.708
Oh yeah! Labor day, baby!

01:16.710 --> 01:18.443
-Yeah!
-Oh, yeah!

01:18.445 --> 01:19.544
-Woo-hoo!
-Everybody...

01:19.546 --> 01:21.913
No, it's time to go...

01:21.915 --> 01:23.849
(reading)

01:25.017 --> 01:26.084
Excuse me?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.954
You heard me. Back to school!

01:28.956 --> 01:30.555
That's where you
adopt the identity

01:30.557 --> 01:32.624
That will define you for
the rest of your life.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.727
And crane kick your karate
rival from the evil dojo,

01:35.729 --> 01:37.729
While falling in love
with elisabeth shue.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.298
Dude, we're awesome
teenagers with no parents.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.401
We can do whatever
we want anytime.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.602
Why would we give that up?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.737
Because our
unique personalities

01:45.739 --> 01:47.406
That have never been
previously depicted

01:47.408 --> 01:51.576
In film or media, are perfect
for a school environment.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.746
Star, with your good looks
and friendly attitude,

01:54.748 --> 01:57.082
You're clearly
the homecoming queen.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.550
Cyborg...

01:58.552 --> 02:01.286
With your massive shoulders
and bulging muscles,

02:01.288 --> 02:03.255
You're obviously a jock.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.757
Raven, with your refusal
to play along

02:05.759 --> 02:07.426
And deep seated anger,

02:07.428 --> 02:09.928
You're clearly a basket case.

02:09.930 --> 02:10.962
What about me?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.264
You, you're a nerd.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.632
Huh, really?

02:13.634 --> 02:16.334
I always felt more like
a bohemian.

02:16.336 --> 02:17.769
Shut it, nerd.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.738
School isn't about
what you feel on the inside.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.406
It's about dressing up
the outside,

02:21.408 --> 02:24.309
So everyone knows
who you are
by looks alone.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.911
So, who are you?

02:25.913 --> 02:29.881
Well, obviously, I am the
all-american boy next door.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.117
<i>I am the guy who</i>
<i>stands up to bullies.</i>

02:32.119 --> 02:34.853
<i>The guy who is elected</i>
<i>student body president.</i>

02:34.855 --> 02:37.255
<i>The guy who</i>
<i>becomes valedictorian.</i>

02:37.257 --> 02:38.824
Who's with me?

02:38.826 --> 02:41.193
If going to school means
being assigned
an arbitrary label,

02:41.195 --> 02:42.394
We're not interested.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.528
I'll buy you all new clothes.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.664
All: We're going
back to school!

02:45.666 --> 02:46.932
(school bell rings)

02:55.408 --> 02:57.542
Friends, I feel this
is the beginning

02:57.544 --> 02:59.644
Of a meaningful
life experience.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.480
There is so much hope here.

03:01.482 --> 03:05.217
It's strange, it makes me
want to learn and
grow as a person.

03:05.219 --> 03:08.720
Too optimistic, basket case.
Stick to your label.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.022
We need to be on the
lookout for a bully,

03:11.024 --> 03:14.826
So this all-american boy
can take him down.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.262
Actually, I gotta get to
english class, robin.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.297
Me, too. I'll come with, brah.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.666
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

03:21.668 --> 03:23.068
You two cannot hang out.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.704
But why not?
They are the best of friends.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.405
What about their labels?

03:27.407 --> 03:29.107
Look at this massive jock.

03:29.109 --> 03:33.845
He's gorgeous with his
big muscles and handsome face.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.981
There's no way
he'd be friends with a nerd.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.216
Just look at him.
He's so small and awkward,

03:38.218 --> 03:42.187
Always studying,
talking about wizards
and dragons all the time.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.722
Wizards?

03:43.724 --> 03:45.390
You think you can break down
social boundaries, nerd?

03:45.392 --> 03:46.591
Not on my watch.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.026
(exclaiming)

03:48.028 --> 03:49.995
Crane kick, crane kick,
crane kick!

03:49.997 --> 03:51.763
(fighting)

03:51.765 --> 03:53.832
-(exclaiming)
-(groaning)

04:03.442 --> 04:04.943
Man, we've been here
five minutes

04:04.945 --> 04:06.311
And you already
got us in detention?

04:06.313 --> 04:09.414
Well, when I see a bully,
I take him down.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.615
Whoo!

04:10.617 --> 04:12.350
(laughing)

04:12.352 --> 04:16.154
No regrets.
That's just the way of
the all-american boy.

04:16.156 --> 04:19.691
All-american boy?
More like crazy
crane kicking guy.

04:19.693 --> 04:23.962
I am still unsure who
exactly was the bully
in that situation.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.131
What, you didn't see this
nerd trying to bully his way

04:26.133 --> 04:27.933
Into hanging out with
this cool jock?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.068
Why do you care about
labels so much?

04:30.070 --> 04:33.838
Maybe, there's more to us than
what's on the surface, bro.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.808
(scoffs and mocks)
that's ridiculous.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.510
We all have our parts to play

04:38.512 --> 04:40.145
And now that
I trashed a bully,

04:40.147 --> 04:43.181
My next part is to become
student body president.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.184
(school bell ringing)

04:50.122 --> 04:50.989
(panting)

04:50.991 --> 04:54.392
Dude, I made it!
I made the team!

04:54.394 --> 04:56.194
That's what's up.

04:56.196 --> 04:59.264
I never thought I'd
be competing in
an academical decathlon.

04:59.266 --> 05:02.367
Friends, raven has
the most wonderful news.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.669
It's just an article in
the school paper, star.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.571
Turns out I love writing.

05:06.573 --> 05:09.074
It's a great way to share
all the feelings that
I keep bottled up.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.776
We're learning so much
about ourselves, yo.

05:11.778 --> 05:14.646
School is the place to be!

05:14.648 --> 05:15.714
(fanfare playing)

05:15.716 --> 05:17.983
(chattering)

05:17.985 --> 05:20.018
Vote robin for
student body president.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.920
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

05:22.722 --> 05:24.956
Ah! What is he doing?

05:24.958 --> 05:26.992
Oh, no, he must think
he is having

05:26.994 --> 05:31.329
One of the "naked
in school" dreams.

05:31.331 --> 05:35.166
Wait, aren't people usually
terrified when they
have that dream?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.735
(exclaiming) vote robin!

05:36.737 --> 05:38.970
Whoo! Vote robin! Whoo!

05:38.972 --> 05:40.839
Vote robin! Break it down now.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.340
He's really owning it.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.377
He probably just thinks
he'll wake up any second.

05:46.178 --> 05:48.246
(laughs) yeah, boy!

05:48.248 --> 05:50.649
Now, that's how
you run for office.

05:51.951 --> 05:55.020
Dude, you are naked in school!

05:55.022 --> 05:56.921
I know.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.923
And this is not a dream.

05:59.925 --> 06:01.493
I know.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.062
The student body will have
no choice but
to vote for the...

06:04.064 --> 06:05.730
(reading)

06:07.066 --> 06:08.867
(laughing)

06:09.869 --> 06:11.836
Oh, you think
that's funny, nerd?

06:11.838 --> 06:13.338
Try laughing at this.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.639
(exclaiming)

06:14.641 --> 06:16.941
-Crane kick, crane kick!
-(groaning)

06:25.017 --> 06:28.219
I cannot believe we have
been detained once again.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.587
I know.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.756
Now, I'm gonna
miss the academical
regional championships.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.324
Who cares about your
nerd olympics?

06:33.326 --> 06:36.027
I was disqualified from
being class president.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.862
You're missing the point
of school, robin.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.231
It's not about labels.
It's about learning who
you are

06:40.233 --> 06:42.167
And finding your place
in the world.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.402
Save it, basket case.

06:44.404 --> 06:48.440
I have one chance left at
being the all-american boy.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.375
I have to become
valedictorian,

06:50.377 --> 06:51.810
No matter what it takes.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.311
(school bell rings)

07:12.098 --> 07:14.365
Phew, I really studied hard.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.802
No games, no scams,
just honest effort.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.538
I think...
No, I know it paid off.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.607
I am the proud of you, robin.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.708
We all are.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.276
(chattering)

07:25.278 --> 07:28.880
Yo, guys, the valet-dictorian
announcement is posted!

07:30.783 --> 07:33.585
(gasps) robin,
you made the list.

07:33.587 --> 07:36.087
(gasping) I'm valedictorian!

07:36.089 --> 07:38.289
No, dude, you're salutatorian.

07:39.492 --> 07:40.759
(crying) what?

07:40.761 --> 07:43.328
Salutatorian, you ranked
second in the class.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.529
Second?

07:44.531 --> 07:46.197
Yeah, it's really good.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.967
And beast boy is
the valedictorian.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.704
Turns out learning ain't hard,
if you just put all
your brains on it.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.839
You're the valedicto-narian,
baby!

07:54.841 --> 07:56.808
(cheering)

07:59.712 --> 08:02.180
No! I was supposed
to be number one!

08:02.182 --> 08:04.449
I'm the all-american
boy next door!

08:04.451 --> 08:07.051
(grunting and exclaiming)

08:07.053 --> 08:08.720
-Crane kick! Crane kick!
-(groaning)

08:08.722 --> 08:10.722
-Crane kick! Crane kick!
-(groaning)

08:10.724 --> 08:12.490
-Crane kick! Crane kick!
-(groaning)

08:12.492 --> 08:13.625
-Wax on!
-(groans)

08:13.627 --> 08:14.893
Paint the fence!

08:14.895 --> 08:15.994
Sweep the leg!

08:15.996 --> 08:17.762
Johnny, you're a cream puff!

08:17.764 --> 08:19.397
I hate this stupid bike!

08:19.399 --> 08:22.834
I'm from reseda!

08:30.309 --> 08:32.644
Thanks for getting us
expelled, dude.

08:32.646 --> 08:35.947
We shall never learn
of our true potential now.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.115
You guys were right.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.317
I was wrong to assign us
those labels.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.452
I am glad you have come
to the understanding

08:41.454 --> 08:44.155
That it is impossible to
describe the complexity

08:44.157 --> 08:46.124
Of a person with
a simple label.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.092
What? No. I just had
the labels wrong.

08:48.094 --> 08:52.263
I am actually the bad boy
with a troubled past and
an uncertain future.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.499
My heart is my compass.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.268
And these fists are
my only companions.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.436
(kissing)

08:59.872 --> 09:01.706
Now, read this.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.608
(whispering)
"dear principal, we accept
the fact that we're..."

09:03.610 --> 09:04.676
Ow!

09:04.678 --> 09:06.911
Out loud, nerd.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.280
"dear principal,
we accept the fact that..."

09:09.282 --> 09:11.316
(reading)

09:15.154 --> 09:17.322
When did the principal
ask us to write a letter?

09:17.324 --> 09:19.557
Keep reading or you're
totaled, man.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.459
-Totally?
-Totally.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.495
"each of us can be described
with the simplest label.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.665
"a green guy
who can turn into animals."

09:27.667 --> 09:28.900
Cyborg: <i> "a cyborg."</i>

09:28.902 --> 09:30.702
Starfire: <i> "a space princess."</i>

09:30.704 --> 09:32.103
Raven: <i> "a half demon."</i>

09:32.105 --> 09:33.938
Robin: <i> "and</i>
<i>a super cool bad boy."</i>
