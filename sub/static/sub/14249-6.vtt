00:25.025 --> 00:26.515
Hello?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.021
Anybody here?

00:34.801 --> 00:36.268
Neelix?

00:38.138 --> 00:41.369
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

00:41.441 --> 00:42.874
Happy birthday, my sweet.

00:42.942 --> 00:45.934
Happy birthday, Kes.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.138
lmagine.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.646
Two years old today.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.980
lf you ask me,
you don't look a day over one.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.485
Why was everyone hiding?

00:53.553 --> 00:57.045
Oh, it's an old earth custom
called a surprise party.

00:57.157 --> 00:58.590
Sorry if we startled you.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.353
No, l liked it.

01:00.427 --> 01:01.792
lt was very exhilarating.

01:01.861 --> 01:06.889
Now, how about a glass
of my special birthday punch?

01:06.966 --> 01:08.433
Garçon?

01:08.501 --> 01:11.026
On the rocks or straight up?

01:11.104 --> 01:14.198
Doctor, l'm so glad you're here.

01:14.274 --> 01:15.605
My new bartender.

01:15.675 --> 01:16.835
Handsome, isn't he?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.606
l'm here in an official
capacity, of course--

01:19.679 --> 01:22.147
in case of a medical emergency.

01:22.215 --> 01:23.307
Emergency?

01:23.383 --> 01:24.577
Surprises have been known

01:24.651 --> 01:28.849
to cause acute hyperventilation,
esophageal spasms

01:28.922 --> 01:31.914
and in extreme cases,
even coronary arrest.

01:31.991 --> 01:33.720
One can never be too careful.

01:33.793 --> 01:34.725
No.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.595
l've completed the sensor
diagnostic, Lieutenant.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.160
All systems are
fully operational.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.536
Very good, Ensign.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.303
And l've recalibrated
the accelerometer relays.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.367
Acknowledged.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.710
ls there anything else
l can do for you, sir?

01:57.083 --> 01:58.914
l presume
this notable impatience

01:58.985 --> 02:01.579
is due to your desire
to attend the festivities

02:01.654 --> 02:02.916
in Holodeck 2.

02:02.989 --> 02:04.149
Yes, sir.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.124
May l remind you
that your duty shift

02:06.192 --> 02:09.025
does not officially terminate
for another 34 minutes.

02:11.464 --> 02:15.423
However, l believe
the holodeck power conduits

02:15.502 --> 02:17.493
would benefit
from a routine inspection.

02:17.570 --> 02:21.097
Yes, sir, l'll get right on it.

02:21.174 --> 02:22.436
All stop.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.443
Mr. Kim.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.276
What is that?

02:28.348 --> 02:30.145
Magnify.

02:33.853 --> 02:36.321
l'm afraid
that holodeck inspection

02:36.389 --> 02:38.755
will have to wait, Ensign.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.317
Wait till you taste this cake.

02:42.395 --> 02:44.795
Seven layers of Jimbalian fudge,

02:44.864 --> 02:48.527
and the icing is made
from pureed l'maki nuts--

02:48.601 --> 02:49.829
Kes' favorite.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.235
Now make a wish
and blow out the candles.

02:52.305 --> 02:53.397
Well, what do l wish for?

02:53.473 --> 02:57.307
Anything your petite coeur
desires, ma chérie,

02:57.377 --> 03:00.642
and with a figure like hers,
she'll probably get it, too.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.677
Okay, l wish for...

03:03.750 --> 03:05.411
Don't tell us.

03:05.485 --> 03:08.045
The wish has to be a secret
if it's going to come true.

03:11.558 --> 03:12.889
Yay!

03:16.162 --> 03:18.756
l hate to interrupt this
tender little moment, Tommy boy,

03:18.831 --> 03:21.925
but don't you think
it's about time we shot a rack?

03:22.001 --> 03:24.265
ln a minute.

03:24.337 --> 03:27.932
Birthday gifts are also
an Earth tradition.

03:28.007 --> 03:29.804
Oh, thank you, Tom.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.138
You didn't have to.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.009
Hey, who am l
to fly in the face of tradition?

03:43.523 --> 03:46.151
Tom, it's beautiful.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.354
lt must have cost you a week's
worth of replicator rations.

03:49.429 --> 03:51.989
Two weeks, actually,
but who's counting?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.226
l'm just glad you like it.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.292
May l?

03:57.370 --> 04:00.168
Oh. lt's lovely.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.707
You see, it's a locket.

04:01.774 --> 04:03.332
You put little photographs
in here.

04:03.409 --> 04:07.539
lt keeps the people you love
close to your heart.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.411
Thank you.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.746
Did you see that?

04:11.818 --> 04:12.910
See what?

04:12.986 --> 04:14.248
He...

04:14.320 --> 04:16.914
he...

04:16.990 --> 04:19.685
he did a lovely wrapping job,
don't you think?

04:19.759 --> 04:20.817
Bridge to Janeway.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.588
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

04:22.662 --> 04:25.563
Captain, we've encountered
an unusual phenomenon...

04:25.632 --> 04:27.930
phenomenon... phenomenon...

04:28.067 --> 04:30.729
phenomenon...
phenomenon...

04:30.803 --> 04:33.738
phenomenon...

04:33.806 --> 04:39.108
phenomenon...
phenomenon... phenomenon...

06:25.451 --> 06:28.079
Phenomenon... phenomenon...

06:28.154 --> 06:30.088
What is going on, Lieutenant?

06:30.156 --> 06:32.386
lt might simply be
a localized malfunction,

06:32.458 --> 06:34.426
but l've never heard
anything like it.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.426
My guess is...

06:36.629 --> 06:38.256
lt's a problem
with the com system itself.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.094
Janeway to Bridge.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.100
Get down to Engineering
and run a diagnostic.

06:42.168 --> 06:44.636
l'm afraid we're going to have
to cut your party short, Kes.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.638
Stations, everyone.
Let's move.

06:46.706 --> 06:47.764
But-but...

06:47.840 --> 06:49.808
what about
the Jimbalian fudge cake?

06:49.876 --> 06:52.777
Save me a slice, won't you?

06:56.649 --> 06:58.810
These readings indicate
the space ahead of us

06:58.885 --> 07:00.045
is literally changing shape.

07:00.119 --> 07:04.055
A best guess is it's some type
of spatial distortion wave.

07:04.123 --> 07:06.353
ls the anomaly responsible
for the com system malfunction?

07:06.426 --> 07:07.552
l think so.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.720
lt's generating intense pulses
of EM radiation,

07:09.796 --> 07:11.354
and if we don't

07:11.431 --> 07:13.831
it's going to intercept us
in less than ten minutes.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.698
Acknowledged.
Full reverse, Ensign.

07:16.769 --> 07:17.793
Aye, sir.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.861
We can't go backwards, either,
Mr. Tuvok.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.998
The distortion has completely
surrounded us, like a ring.

07:24.610 --> 07:25.907
lf we cannot go around it,

07:25.978 --> 07:27.707
then we will have
to go through it.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.771
There's no telling
what that would do to the ship.

07:29.849 --> 07:31.510
From what you have told me,
Ensign,

07:31.584 --> 07:34.451
the distortion ring will make
contact with us momentarily

07:34.520 --> 07:36.715
whether we attempt
to pass through it or not.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.758
l prefer to minimize the amount
of time that contact lasts.

07:39.826 --> 07:41.418
Shields at maximum.

07:41.494 --> 07:44.622
Warp 3. Engage.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.435
The distortion ring
has collapsed the warp field.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.198
Engines are off-line.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.804
Find the Captain
and inform her of our status.

07:56.876 --> 07:57.865
Yes, sir.

08:11.591 --> 08:14.754
Ensign Kim, l've been trying
to report a problem in the gym,

08:14.827 --> 08:16.692
but the com system
seems to be down.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.389
We've encountered
a spatial distortion.

08:18.464 --> 08:19.863
lt's knocked out
several systems.

08:19.932 --> 08:22.298
Maybe that explains
why the gym got so cold.

08:22.368 --> 08:23.733
Cold?

08:23.803 --> 08:24.997
Well, l didn't
notice it at first,

08:25.071 --> 08:26.060
l was working out so hard.

08:26.138 --> 08:27.867
Then l realized it was
under 10 degrees C.

08:27.974 --> 08:30.306
The environmental controls
didn't respond to my commands

08:30.376 --> 08:32.309
and neither did the com system.

08:32.378 --> 08:34.039
Engines are off-line, too.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.909
l'm looking for the Captain
to let her know what's going on.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.607
Should l report
to my duty station?

08:37.683 --> 08:38.910
Might not be a bad idea.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.009
Until we find out
exactly what's going on,

08:41.087 --> 08:42.577
everybody should be on standby.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.283
l'll round up
my security team.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.456
The first thing l want to do
when we get to the Bridge

08:52.532 --> 08:54.329
is establish a remote com link
to Engineering.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.924
l want to know exactly
what's going on.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.436
Aye, Captain.

08:58.504 --> 08:59.528
Where are we?

08:59.605 --> 09:01.573
Deck 4.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.039
lf the com system's
malfunctioning,

09:03.075 --> 09:05.509
the computer could be misreading
our voice commands.

09:05.578 --> 09:08.012
That might explain why it took
us here instead of the Bridge.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.674
We'd better try setting
the controls manually.

09:14.453 --> 09:17.183
Did you enjoy your first
surprise party, sweeting?

09:17.256 --> 09:18.848
lt was wonderful.
Thank you.

09:18.925 --> 09:23.021
l thought you'd like it--
the cake, the presents.

09:23.095 --> 09:25.427
What was your favorite part?

09:25.498 --> 09:26.863
l suppose what l liked best

09:26.933 --> 09:28.833
was that all my friends
were there.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.528
Ah, that was nice, wasn't it?

09:30.603 --> 09:32.867
And don't forget
that beautiful necklace

09:32.939 --> 09:35.407
Tom Paris gave you.

09:35.474 --> 09:36.907
Do you really like it?

09:36.976 --> 09:38.409
Oh, why wouldn't l like it?

09:38.477 --> 09:40.342
Paris obviously has
excellent taste.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.576
l was afraid you might be
a little jealous.

09:43.649 --> 09:44.843
Who, me?

09:44.917 --> 09:47.477
Oh, don't be silly.

09:47.553 --> 09:48.747
Are you sure?

09:48.821 --> 09:51.051
You, my dearest,
have seen the last

09:51.123 --> 09:53.921
of that green-eyed pus hog
called jealousy.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.858
l'm glad.

09:55.928 --> 09:59.921
Of course, Paris did
replicate that locket,

09:59.999 --> 10:04.265
whereas l baked the Jimbalian
fudge cake from scratch.

10:05.504 --> 10:07.768
These aren't my quarters.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.933
Did we take a wrong turn
somewhere?

10:10.009 --> 10:12.477
l was just following you.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.251
ls everything all right,
Lieutenant?

10:26.325 --> 10:28.088
This isn't Engineering.

10:35.501 --> 10:36.468
And have someone take a look

10:36.535 --> 10:38.503
at the turbolift voice
receptors, Commander.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.539
Aye, Captain.

10:40.606 --> 10:41.538
This is Engineering.

10:41.607 --> 10:42.665
What's going on here?

10:42.742 --> 10:43.766
Looks like we're dealing

10:43.843 --> 10:45.834
with more than just
a com system malfunction.

10:45.911 --> 10:48.072
Computer, Bridge.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.405
Baxter, what are you doing here?

11:20.479 --> 11:21.707
l wish l knew.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.646
l'm trying to get
to the cargo bay.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.843
And l'm trying to get
to Engineering.

11:25.918 --> 11:27.977
l can't find the cargo bay,

11:28.054 --> 11:29.487
and l can't find
my security team.

11:29.555 --> 11:32.388
l've been wandering around
for about ten minutes.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.483
Well, at least
l know l'm not crazy...

11:34.560 --> 11:35.993
unless we both are.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.859
No. Something very strange
is going on.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.864
Ensign Kim said we had
encountered a spatial

11:39.932 --> 11:40.864
distortion.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.491
Did he say what kind?

11:42.568 --> 11:44.160
No, and he went to find
the Captain.

11:44.236 --> 11:46.704
The Captain is on her way
to the Bridge,

11:46.772 --> 11:48.330
but if she's having the
same trouble we are,

11:48.407 --> 11:50.705
-who knows if she can get there.
-Yeah.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.778
l'm going to keep trying
to get to Engineering.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.007
Good luck.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.095
The holodeck again.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.098
Aha!

12:15.167 --> 12:16.099
This is infuriating.

12:16.168 --> 12:19.262
Ah, stop playing games,
mon chéri.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.203
l know why you keep
coming back to work

12:21.273 --> 12:23.264
even though your
bartending shift is over.

12:24.343 --> 12:25.708
lt's to see me, of course.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.473
How many times
do l have to tell you, madam?

12:27.546 --> 12:28.808
-Oh!
-l am a doctor, not a bartender.

12:28.881 --> 12:31.179
Of course, you are.

12:36.655 --> 12:37.815
Doc?

12:38.858 --> 12:39.984
Ensign Kim.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.321
l was just, uh...

12:41.393 --> 12:43.156
Playing doctor.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.054
Hi.

12:47.066 --> 12:48.192
Hi.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.462
The Captain and the others
went to investigate

12:50.536 --> 12:53.232
the phenomenon
Mr. Tuvok reported.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.830
So all of you heard his report
before the com system failed?

12:55.908 --> 12:57.205
Only a fraction of it.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.302
Well, l'm sure Tuvok's filled
them in with the rest by now.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.210
What are you still doing
on the holodeck, besides

13:02.281 --> 13:04.146
playing doctor, that is?

13:04.216 --> 13:06.582
For your information,
l have been attempting

13:06.652 --> 13:08.586
to transfer myself
back to Sick Bay,

13:08.654 --> 13:11.521
but each time l try,
l reappear here.

13:11.590 --> 13:12.818
That's strange.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.450
Not to mention
extremely irritating.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.052
l can't seem to shut down
Mr. Paris'

13:17.129 --> 13:18.357
holo-program either.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.591
Computer, end holodeck
program Paris 3.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.601
Computer, arch.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.134
Either the holo-emitters
are malfunctioning,

13:27.206 --> 13:29.766
or the computer's not accepting
voice commands.

13:29.842 --> 13:30.934
l'm sorry, Doctor,

13:31.010 --> 13:32.307
l don't have time
to help you right now.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.811
-Wait just a minute.
-Hmm?

13:33.879 --> 13:35.244
Where do you think
you're going?

13:35.314 --> 13:36.338
l've got to get back
to the Bridge.

13:36.415 --> 13:37.541
We're in the middle of a crisis.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.709
All the more reason
l should be back in Sick Bay.

13:39.785 --> 13:41.343
l'm sure that the Captain
and the others

13:41.420 --> 13:43.581
will be able to do without you
for a few more minutes.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.783
l guess you're right.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.622
l'll have a look
at the holo-controls.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.367
Kyoto's quarters.

14:02.441 --> 14:03.874
Nicoletti.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.705
Hargrove.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.776
Ayala.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.545
None of those are
anywhere near my quarters.

14:12.618 --> 14:13.482
This is Deck 8.

14:13.552 --> 14:14.678
That's where your quarters are.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.584
But Hargrove and Ayala
are on Deck 7.

14:17.656 --> 14:18.918
Nicoletti is on 4,

14:18.991 --> 14:21.084
and l think Kyoto is on 6.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.357
How do you know
where everyone's quarters are?

14:24.430 --> 14:26.364
l just remember.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.764
Remember from what?

14:28.834 --> 14:31.325
Have you been
in all their quarters?

14:31.403 --> 14:32.665
Of course not.

14:32.738 --> 14:35.206
The point is, those quarters
can't all be on the same deck.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.435
Well, see for yourself.

14:37.509 --> 14:40.444
This can't be.

14:40.512 --> 14:44.505
Perhaps, sweeting, your memory
isn't as reliable as you think.

14:44.583 --> 14:45.641
This is impossible.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.345
l know Hargrove is on 7.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.321
Why Hargrove?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.583
What?

14:51.657 --> 14:54.524
Why are you so sure
about Hargrove's quarters?

14:54.593 --> 14:57.289
What makes him... so special?

14:57.363 --> 14:58.728
He's not special.

14:58.797 --> 15:01.493
l just remember
where his quarters are.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.864
This way.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.096
lt has to be this way.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.840
Harry.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.042
B'Elanna, shouldn't you
be in Engineering?

15:18.117 --> 15:19.243
What are you doing here?

15:19.318 --> 15:21.411
Just answer one question,
Starfleet.

15:21.487 --> 15:22.579
Where is here?

15:22.655 --> 15:23.587
What?!

15:23.656 --> 15:24.918
Where am l?

15:24.990 --> 15:26.582
Outside Holodeck 2.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.422
Are you feeling okay?

15:28.494 --> 15:31.054
l have been walking in circles
for the past 20 minutes

15:31.130 --> 15:32.927
trying to get to Engineering.

15:32.998 --> 15:36.661
Kes, my sweet, you have many
wonderful attributes.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.727
Your sense of direction
is not one of them. l...

15:39.805 --> 15:42.774
Oh, uh, Harry, B'Elanna,
maybe you can help us.

15:42.841 --> 15:44.638
l know you'll find
this hard to believe,

15:44.710 --> 15:47.406
but we can't seem to find
Kes' quarters.

15:52.818 --> 15:53.910
l don't suppose

15:53.986 --> 15:56.352
anyone here knows
the way to the Bridge?

16:04.063 --> 16:05.360
Let me get this straight--

16:05.431 --> 16:08.525
this distortion ring
has completely immobilized us.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.295
We have
no means of communication

16:10.369 --> 16:12.428
with the Bridge
or any other part of the ship,

16:12.504 --> 16:15.029
and no matter where any of us
have tried to go--

16:15.107 --> 16:17.507
the Bridge, Engineering,
Kes' quarters--

16:17.576 --> 16:20.044
we've all eventually
ended up here.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.672
Right back at Deck 6.

16:22.748 --> 16:26.081
The Bridge is on Deck 1.
Engineering is on Deck 1 1.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.676
Deck 6 is halfway
in between, right?

16:28.754 --> 16:29.846
So?

16:29.922 --> 16:32.516
So, if we're being surrounded
by this ring,

16:32.591 --> 16:34.559
maybe it's pushing us all
to the center of the ship.

16:34.626 --> 16:37.026
But it's not just that
we're being led back here.

16:37.096 --> 16:38.927
l mean, rooms are
in the wrong place.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.432
ls it possible
that this distortion ring

16:41.500 --> 16:45.266
is somehow changing
the layout of the ship?

16:45.337 --> 16:47.305
There is another possibility.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.307
Exposure to some types
of EM radiation

16:49.375 --> 16:52.139
has been known to cause
hallucinations.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.702
Perhaps it's not the ship
that's undergone changes

16:54.780 --> 16:56.975
but rather
your perception of it.

16:57.049 --> 16:58.983
Unfortunately,
without my medical equipment

16:59.084 --> 17:01.552
to analyze your optic nerves,
there's no way to tell.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.416
We'll never figure it out
sitting here.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.685
We need more information
about this phenomenon--

17:05.758 --> 17:07.851
sensor readings,
computer analyses.

17:07.925 --> 17:10.952
We have to find a way
back to the Bridge.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.191
lf we can't get back on foot
or on the turbolift,

17:13.265 --> 17:15.130
maybe we can rig
a site-to-site transport--

17:15.200 --> 17:17.566
beam ourselves to the Bridge.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.762
We'd have to get
to a transporter room first.

17:19.838 --> 17:21.099
Or to Engineering.

17:21.173 --> 17:23.436
Wherever that is.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.739
When we tried to go
to the Bridge,

17:25.810 --> 17:28.746
one of the places the turbolift
took us was Engineering.

17:28.814 --> 17:31.374
Maybe if we repeat our steps,
it'll take us back there.

17:31.450 --> 17:32.382
lt's worth a shot.

17:32.451 --> 17:36.410
Lieutenant Paris,
you're with Torres.

17:37.656 --> 17:40.147
Maybe we can get to the Bridge
through a Jefferies tube.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.817
lf l remember my ship specs
correctly,

17:41.894 --> 17:43.794
there should be
an emergency access conduit

17:43.862 --> 17:45.386
which leads directly
from this deck

17:45.464 --> 17:47.659
to Deck 1,
right behind the Bridge.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.928
l'd like to keep trying
to get to the Bridge on foot.

17:50.002 --> 17:52.869
lf the ship has been
reconfigured somehow, l can get

17:52.938 --> 17:55.372
a deck-by-deck picture
of what it looks like as l go.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.033
What's going to keep you
from getting lost?

17:57.109 --> 17:59.270
l'll get a tricorder
from the storage locker,

17:59.344 --> 18:00.675
rig it to emit
a photoplasmic trail.

18:00.779 --> 18:01.711
Right.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.305
We should all get tricorders.

18:03.382 --> 18:04.508
Set them on active scan,

18:04.583 --> 18:05.982
gather as much information
as we can

18:06.051 --> 18:07.450
about what's happening
to the ship.

18:07.519 --> 18:08.486
May l request that Kes

18:08.554 --> 18:10.215
be allowed to stay
here with me?

18:10.289 --> 18:12.280
Besides helping stave off

18:12.357 --> 18:15.793
the predatory advances
of that... woman,

18:15.861 --> 18:17.829
she may be able
to help me find a way

18:17.896 --> 18:19.864
to transfer myself
back to Sick Bay.

18:19.932 --> 18:24.528
And, uh, l'll assist
Commander Chakotay, Captain.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.865
As you may have heard,

18:25.938 --> 18:29.567
my tracking skills are legendary
throughout the quadrant.

18:29.641 --> 18:31.666
That all right with you,
Commander?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.876
Mr. Kim, l'm with you.

18:35.948 --> 18:36.880
Let's do it.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.085
Be careful.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.749
Are you sure this is
how you got there before?

18:44.823 --> 18:46.916
Relax, will you?

18:46.992 --> 18:49.756
So far, we're right on schedule.

18:49.828 --> 18:51.318
The next stop should be...

18:53.465 --> 18:55.126
...Voila. Engineering.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.100
Finally.
Let's get to work.

18:57.169 --> 18:59.364
We've got an emergency situation
on board ship.

18:59.438 --> 19:01.099
l don't have time
to go into details,

19:01.206 --> 19:03.037
but you're all to remain
at your posts

19:03.075 --> 19:04.133
until otherwise notified,

19:04.209 --> 19:06.177
whether or not
your duty shifts are over.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.679
Ensign, prepare to configure
transporter systems

19:08.747 --> 19:10.009
for a site-to-site transport.

19:10.082 --> 19:12.016
l've got to reset
the pattern buffer controls.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.016
ln the meantime,

19:13.085 --> 19:15.315
why don't you check
the targeting scanners?

19:19.258 --> 19:21.283
Crewman...

19:21.360 --> 19:24.523
there's a-an emergency situation
aboard ship.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.996
Just...
stay right where you are.

19:27.065 --> 19:28.828
That's an order.

19:35.941 --> 19:40.401
l think you handled that
very well, Lieutenant.

19:51.123 --> 19:54.752
Commander, l would imagine

19:54.826 --> 19:57.761
you've had
some experience with women.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.261
Some.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.425
Oh, come now! Ha!

20:02.501 --> 20:06.597
A... a... a
handsome man like you.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.264
l bet women find
you irresistible.

20:10.342 --> 20:13.743
Neelix, what's this about?

20:13.812 --> 20:14.904
Uh...

20:14.980 --> 20:17.505
um... uh...

20:17.583 --> 20:20.313
have you... uh...

20:20.385 --> 20:23.877
have you... ever been jealous?

20:25.857 --> 20:27.347
Of course.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.984
You have?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.996
l imagine most people
who have been in love

20:32.064 --> 20:33.531
have been jealous
at one time or another.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.829
l see!

20:35.901 --> 20:38.995
l-lt's a perfectly
normal response.

20:39.071 --> 20:43.030
Then why...
why is it so unpleasant?

20:45.244 --> 20:48.509
Jealousy's about the fear
of losing someone we love.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.344
There's no pain
greater than that.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.548
Neelix...

20:57.623 --> 21:00.649
are you afraid you're going
to lose Kes to someone?

21:00.726 --> 21:02.091
No.

21:02.160 --> 21:05.095
l mean, l-l-l don't think so.

21:05.163 --> 21:08.098
At least, l certainly hope not.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.259
l-l... l just
can't seem to stop

21:10.335 --> 21:12.599
these awful feelings.

21:12.671 --> 21:16.937
Nothing makes us more vulnerable
than when we love someone.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.603
We can be hurt very easily.

21:19.678 --> 21:21.305
But l've always believed

21:21.380 --> 21:23.314
that what you get
when you love someone

21:23.382 --> 21:25.282
is greater than what you risk.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.318
Commander,
am l ever glad to see you.

21:27.386 --> 21:28.648
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

21:28.720 --> 21:29.880
Not exactly.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.786
Well, l feel like l've been
wandering around for hours.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.154
l can't find the cargo bay.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.284
Have you seen anyone else?
Any more of the crew?

21:35.360 --> 21:37.828
Some people roaming around
like me.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.591
A couple of times
l wound up in the Mess Hall.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.098
There were quite
a few people there.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.463
l suggest
you make your way back.

21:42.534 --> 21:44.297
Tell everyone you run into
to come with you,

21:44.369 --> 21:45.996
and all of you stay put
in the Mess Hall.

21:46.104 --> 21:47.002
When we figure out

21:47.105 --> 21:49.266
what's going on,
we'll let you know.

21:49.341 --> 21:50.672
Aye, Commander.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.744
Gentlemen.

22:01.119 --> 22:02.416
Tuvok,
what are you doing here?

22:02.487 --> 22:04.114
That is an interesting
question, Commander.

22:04.189 --> 22:06.919
l am not certain
how l arrived at this location.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.254
You're lost, too.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.589
lndeed.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.595
When l received no word
from you or the Captain,

22:11.663 --> 22:13.654
l left Lieutenant Ayala
in command

22:13.732 --> 22:15.666
and came to look for you myself.

22:15.734 --> 22:17.133
Can you lead us back
to the Bridge?

22:17.202 --> 22:19.261
l do not believe so.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.306
When l first realized
l was lost,

22:21.373 --> 22:23.307
l attempted to retrace my steps,

22:23.375 --> 22:24.808
only to find myself here.

22:24.876 --> 22:27.242
None of us has been able
to reach the Bridge.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.644
ln fact, Neelix and l
can't seem to get off Deck 6.

22:29.715 --> 22:33.151
Strange.
l thought we were on Deck 3.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.489
What was our status
when you left the Bridge?

22:38.557 --> 22:39.990
The ring has penetrated
our shields

22:40.058 --> 22:42.822
and is now in direct contact
with the hull.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.759
Then maybe it is possible
the distortions

22:44.830 --> 22:46.457
are somehow
reconfiguring the ship.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.089
As improbable as it sounds,

22:48.166 --> 22:50.100
that would appear
to be the case.

22:50.268 --> 22:52.065
Neelix, let's go.

22:55.073 --> 22:56.700
Neelix.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.914
l don't understand it.

23:12.991 --> 23:16.119
We should have found the hatch
to the Bridge ten minutes ago.

23:16.194 --> 23:17.752
l feel like
we're crawling in circles.

23:17.829 --> 23:18.761
But we haven't--

23:18.830 --> 23:20.422
at least not according
to this tricorder.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.567
Odd!

23:22.634 --> 23:23.794
What is it?

23:23.869 --> 23:26.030
A very faint
electromagnetic reading.

23:26.104 --> 23:29.267
Now it's gone.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.309
There it is
from another direction.

23:31.376 --> 23:32.434
Yeah, l'm getting it, too.

23:32.511 --> 23:33.603
lt comes and goes.

23:33.678 --> 23:35.839
Jumps from place to place.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.178
Could it be evidence
of the ship's reconfiguration?

23:38.250 --> 23:39.444
Possibly.

23:39.518 --> 23:43.818
We'll have to compare this data
with readings the others get.

23:43.889 --> 23:45.151
Harry?

23:45.223 --> 23:46.986
Yes, ma'am?

23:47.058 --> 23:49.151
l just want you to know...

23:49.227 --> 23:51.161
you've been one
of the bright spots

23:51.229 --> 23:52.253
of this whole mission.

23:52.330 --> 23:55.094
You've exceeded any expectations
l might have had of you.

23:55.167 --> 23:58.000
Thank you, Captain.

23:58.069 --> 24:01.368
l... l appreciate that.

24:04.843 --> 24:05.969
Wait a minute.

24:07.145 --> 24:08.407
Down there.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.505
l think that's the conduit
leading to the Bridge.

24:10.582 --> 24:11.742
Good work.

24:11.817 --> 24:15.309
Maybe now we'll get
some answers.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.479
That's the hatch, Captain.

24:16.555 --> 24:18.250
This should let us out
in the cargo hold

24:18.323 --> 24:21.087
directly behind the Bridge.

24:21.159 --> 24:22.922
lt's not working.

24:22.994 --> 24:25.053
We'd better try it manually.

24:33.004 --> 24:35.336
lt's stuck.

24:35.407 --> 24:36.533
Oh!

24:37.776 --> 24:38.743
Oh...

24:38.810 --> 24:39.868
Captain!

24:50.088 --> 24:52.522
l... c-can't...

24:52.591 --> 24:55.924
get my arm out.

24:55.994 --> 24:59.430
Oh! Oh...

25:01.900 --> 25:03.868
Oh...

25:10.342 --> 25:12.902
l think l'm okay.

25:15.947 --> 25:18.074
l'm reading an intense
electromagnetic charge

25:18.149 --> 25:19.411
on the other side of that hatch.

25:19.484 --> 25:21.281
That must have been
what was pulling you in.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.753
lt's as if everything
on the other side

25:23.822 --> 25:26.450
is in a state
of structural flux--

25:26.525 --> 25:28.254
the walls, the atmosphere...

25:28.326 --> 25:30.590
And the sequence
of those fluctuations

25:30.662 --> 25:32.653
matches the readings
from the distortion ring.

25:32.731 --> 25:35.131
This phenomenon isn't just
occurring in space.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.361
lt's definitely inside the ship
as well.

25:37.435 --> 25:38.868
We're going to have to regroup

25:38.937 --> 25:41.269
and come up with a plan
for combating this thing.

25:43.241 --> 25:44.708
Captain, what's wrong?

25:44.776 --> 25:46.937
l don't know.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.639
Oh...

25:48.713 --> 25:50.578
Oh, my eyes...

25:50.649 --> 25:51.707
Captain?

25:51.783 --> 25:53.045
Captain!

25:54.819 --> 25:58.152
Come on, pal, one lousy game.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.815
l'll spot you six balls.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.688
l'm not programmed
to play games.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.385
lf he won't play pool with you,

26:03.428 --> 26:04.520
and he won't make love to me,

26:04.596 --> 26:08.191
then as far as l'm concerned,
he can mop the floor.

26:08.266 --> 26:09.699
You see these hands?

26:09.768 --> 26:11.030
These are surgeon's hands,

26:11.102 --> 26:12.194
created
by the most sophisticated

26:12.270 --> 26:14.238
computer imaging technology
available.

26:14.306 --> 26:17.707
They do not play games,
and they do not mop floors!

26:17.776 --> 26:19.243
Then you are fired.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.369
l will find a new bartender.

26:20.445 --> 26:23.539
l really wish you would.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.105
Doctor...

26:25.183 --> 26:26.741
Please tell me
you've had some success

26:26.818 --> 26:28.183
in reinitializing
the holo-emitters.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.413
l did exactly what you told me,

26:29.487 --> 26:30.419
but it didn't work.

26:30.488 --> 26:31.750
Of course not.

26:31.823 --> 26:33.256
l'm starting to get worried
about Neelix.

26:33.325 --> 26:34.257
What's taking them so long?

26:34.326 --> 26:35.418
Ah, trust me, chérie.

26:35.493 --> 26:36.585
You are better off without him.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.595
All men are alike.

26:38.663 --> 26:41.598
ln the end,
they always break your heart.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.930
Can l get some help here?

26:44.002 --> 26:45.196
What happened to her?

26:45.270 --> 26:47.101
She came into contact
with the spatial distortions

26:47.172 --> 26:48.264
in the Jefferies tube.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.671
She seemed fine
for a couple minutes,

26:49.741 --> 26:51.902
but then she started to fade
in and out of consciousness.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.848
l believe we should
go this way, Commander.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.546
Wh-What makes you say that?

27:04.589 --> 27:07.183
lf we are indeed trapped
in some sort of labyrinth,

27:07.258 --> 27:09.590
then the logical course is
to systematically eliminate

27:09.661 --> 27:12.255
all routes which do not lead us
to our desired destination.

27:12.330 --> 27:16.096
The route that remains
will be the correct one.

27:16.167 --> 27:17.862
Since we have been making
a series of right turns,

27:17.936 --> 27:20.769
we should continue to do so
until we are certain

27:20.839 --> 27:22.739
this path is not the proper one.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.604
There's a flaw in your logic.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.803
How so, Commander?

27:26.878 --> 27:28.368
You're assuming
there's a logical pattern

27:28.446 --> 27:29.504
to this maze we're caught in,

27:29.581 --> 27:31.378
but so far l haven't seen
any evidence of that.

27:31.449 --> 27:34.179
Even within chaotic systems,

27:34.252 --> 27:36.379
there is a pattern
of limited predictability.

27:36.454 --> 27:38.012
By the time we figure
that pattern out,

27:38.089 --> 27:40.421
these distortions may have
completely overrun the ship.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.926
That is a possibility.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.621
The important thing is
for at least one of us

27:44.696 --> 27:45.822
to make it back to the Bridge.

27:45.897 --> 27:47.626
So why don't you go your way,
and l'll go mine.

27:47.699 --> 27:49.599
That way, we'll increase
the chances that one of us

27:49.668 --> 27:51.260
will be successful.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.031
As you wish, Commander.

28:07.552 --> 28:09.179
Tell me something, Tuvok.

28:09.254 --> 28:11.848
What does your logic tell you
about navigating a maze

28:11.923 --> 28:13.618
that's constantly
changing shape?

28:17.696 --> 28:18.788
Scanners check out.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.524
Then we're ready
to give it a try.

28:20.598 --> 28:22.429
Activate the auxiliary
pattern buffers.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.694
Pattern buffers activated.

28:23.768 --> 28:26.032
Targeting the Bridge
coordinates.

28:26.104 --> 28:28.402
Scanners locked.

28:31.576 --> 28:33.544
Energize.

28:47.492 --> 28:50.461
Would you mind moving
your foot, Tommy boy?

28:50.528 --> 28:52.587
lt's blocking my shot.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.026
Tell me you already
made it to the Bridge,

28:58.103 --> 29:00.037
and you've come back here
to give us a status report.

29:00.105 --> 29:01.470
We locked on
to the Bridge coordinates,

29:01.539 --> 29:04.007
but this is where we ended up.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.235
None of you had any luck either?

29:05.310 --> 29:07.301
Not only has no one been able
to reach the Bridge,

29:07.378 --> 29:09.346
but the Captain
came into contact

29:09.414 --> 29:11.814
with the spatial distortion
and is now unconscious.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.111
That's not all.

29:13.184 --> 29:14.173
We lost Neelix, too.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.844
Lost him?

29:15.920 --> 29:18.684
He turned a corner,
and he was just gone.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.692
We think the spatial distortions
are continuously changing

29:21.760 --> 29:23.421
the configuration
of the corridors.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.019
Kes must be worried sick.

29:25.096 --> 29:28.361
And it isn't just Neelix
who's missing.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.695
Where's the rest of the crew?

29:29.768 --> 29:31.030
lt is likely that they, too,

29:31.102 --> 29:32.865
are trapped
in other parts of the ship,

29:32.937 --> 29:35.963
cut off from communication and
unable to find their way out.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.200
So, what do we do now?

29:37.275 --> 29:39.675
This wave is obviously causing

29:39.744 --> 29:41.871
some kind of radical
reconfiguration of the ship.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.311
We've got to try to reverse it.

29:43.381 --> 29:46.077
lf not, we may never be
able to get to the Bridge.

29:46.151 --> 29:49.587
How are we supposed to reverse
something we don't understand?

29:49.654 --> 29:51.485
No matter where we go,
we end up here.

29:51.556 --> 29:54.923
Corridors are realigning,
rooms are in the wrong place...

29:55.026 --> 29:55.924
What's the pattern?

29:56.027 --> 29:58.257
We would certainly
benefit from having

29:58.329 --> 30:00.593
an accurate picture of what
the ship currently looks like.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.155
That way we would have
a better chance

30:02.233 --> 30:04.098
of getting where we want to go.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.103
Maybe we could make a map.

30:06.171 --> 30:07.103
Ensign?

30:07.172 --> 30:08.639
One good thing

30:08.706 --> 30:10.105
about all the wandering
we've been doing

30:10.175 --> 30:12.075
is that we've been collecting
a lot of tricorder data

30:12.143 --> 30:14.111
about the structural changes
that have been taking place.

30:14.179 --> 30:15.806
And if we fed
all that information

30:15.880 --> 30:18.440
into the central database,
the computer might be able

30:18.516 --> 30:21.542
to extrapolate a schematic of
the ship as it's configured now.

30:21.619 --> 30:23.587
What are we waiting for?

30:29.027 --> 30:31.996
The computer has analyzed
all our tricorder data,

30:32.063 --> 30:34.725
so this ought to be pretty close
to what it looks like now.

30:36.534 --> 30:39.731
lt's as if the entire ship
is being compressed

30:39.804 --> 30:40.964
and twisted.

30:41.039 --> 30:44.475
My guess is, it's more
than just a distortion ring.

30:44.542 --> 30:47.477
lt looks like some sort
of spatial implosion

30:47.545 --> 30:49.410
that's slowly crushing us.

30:51.749 --> 30:55.048
Look-- this part of the ship
seems unaffected.

30:55.119 --> 30:56.518
That's Deck 6, where we are.

30:56.588 --> 30:57.555
Correct, Ensign.

30:57.622 --> 30:59.419
However, the area
we are occupying

30:59.490 --> 31:01.583
will not remain
unaffected indefinitely.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.661
How long?

31:03.695 --> 31:06.255
Based on the rate
of implosion thus far,

31:06.331 --> 31:08.060
l estimate the ring
will crush Deck 6

31:08.132 --> 31:10.965
in approximately 68 minutes.

31:23.181 --> 31:25.979
ls this implosion ring
some kind of weapon?

31:26.050 --> 31:27.483
Are we under attack?

31:27.552 --> 31:29.144
Who'd want to attack us and why?

31:29.220 --> 31:30.687
There is no clear evidence

31:30.755 --> 31:32.985
of an intelligence
behind the phenomenon.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.149
lt is still possible

31:34.225 --> 31:36.455
we are dealing with
a naturally occurring anomaly

31:36.527 --> 31:38.961
which does not conform
to the known laws of physics.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.362
Don't you think it's a little
late to be speculating on who

31:41.432 --> 31:42.956
or what this thing is?

31:43.034 --> 31:44.934
The important thing now
is that we find out some way

31:45.003 --> 31:45.935
of stopping it.

31:46.004 --> 31:46.868
B'Elanna's right.

31:46.938 --> 31:49.338
lt seems to me
we've got two options:

31:49.407 --> 31:50.999
one, we find a way
to get ourselves out

31:51.075 --> 31:52.372
of this implosion ring,
or two,

31:52.443 --> 31:54.604
we find some way
of reversing it.

31:54.679 --> 31:55.646
lnvert the effect.

31:55.713 --> 31:57.146
Turn the implosion
into an explosion.

31:57.215 --> 31:58.307
Exactly.

31:58.383 --> 31:59.543
lf l can get back
to Engineering,

31:59.617 --> 32:00.481
l may be able to generate

32:00.585 --> 32:02.143
a shock pulse strong enough
to do just that.

32:02.186 --> 32:03.619
Of course l'd have
to raise the pressure

32:03.688 --> 32:04.916
in the warp core
to near-critical.

32:04.989 --> 32:07.184
A shock pulse of that magnitude
would create

32:07.258 --> 32:09.590
a subatomic particle shower
all over the ship.

32:09.661 --> 32:10.923
Which could set off

32:10.995 --> 32:12.292
a chain reaction
that would cause

32:12.363 --> 32:13.762
not only the ring
to explode outward

32:13.831 --> 32:15.298
but Voyager along with it.

32:15.366 --> 32:18.096
Not if l can precisely tune
the shock pulse

32:18.169 --> 32:20.160
to the distortion frequency
of the ring.

32:20.238 --> 32:22.103
That will be
exceptionally difficult.

32:22.173 --> 32:23.401
lf we don't give this a try,

32:23.474 --> 32:24.941
we're going
to get crushed anyway.

32:25.009 --> 32:28.308
Personally, l'd rather
go down fighting.

32:28.379 --> 32:30.347
l must remind you
that with the com system down,

32:30.415 --> 32:33.145
we will have no effective means
of alerting the rest of the crew

32:33.217 --> 32:34.878
to a potentially lethal
particle shower.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.251
Do you have another suggestion,
Mr. Tuvok?

32:37.322 --> 32:38.914
l believe it would be safer

32:38.990 --> 32:41.515
to attempt to access
the navigational array

32:41.592 --> 32:45.084
and from there engage thrusters
to steer us out of the ring.

32:45.163 --> 32:47.290
Can't we try both?

32:47.365 --> 32:49.424
lt's much too dangerous
to have someone working

32:49.500 --> 32:51.365
at the navigational array
during a shock pulse.

32:51.436 --> 32:53.233
Besides,
this ship is so contorted,

32:53.304 --> 32:56.671
there's no reason to expect we'd
have any navigational control.

32:56.741 --> 32:59.335
All right, B'Elanna, let's give
your plan a shot. You...

32:59.410 --> 33:00.434
Commander Chakotay.

33:00.545 --> 33:01.671
Yes, Lieutenant?

33:01.713 --> 33:02.873
l feel compelled to point out

33:02.981 --> 33:04.414
that in my many years
of experience

33:04.482 --> 33:06.109
as Captain Janeway's
technical officer,

33:06.184 --> 33:09.244
she often demonstrated
a tendency to follow...

33:09.320 --> 33:10.412
ln case you hadn't noticed,

33:10.488 --> 33:11.682
Captain Janeway's
not in any condition

33:11.756 --> 33:13.018
to make decisions.

33:13.091 --> 33:14.217
l'm in command.

33:14.292 --> 33:15.554
ls that understood?

33:15.626 --> 33:17.389
Yes, sir.

33:17.462 --> 33:18.724
Good.

33:18.796 --> 33:21.264
B'Elanna, you and Harry
get down to Engineering.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.924
Evacuate whoever's on duty.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.696
Then initiate the warp pulse.

33:24.769 --> 33:26.964
Move it.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.143
Dilithium matrix stable.

33:35.213 --> 33:37.977
Matter/antimatter reactor
is at 80 percent of critical.

33:38.049 --> 33:39.175
Let's keep it that way!

33:39.250 --> 33:41.343
Warp core pressure is at
36 megapascals and rising.

33:41.419 --> 33:44.115
When it reaches 53,
it'll trigger the shock pulse.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.850
We should get out of here
by the time it hits 50!

33:46.924 --> 33:47.982
Acknowledged.

33:48.059 --> 33:49.617
Pressure at 41 megapascals
and rising.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.889
l'm reading a micro-fracture
in the dilithium matrix.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.760
Attempting to compensate.

33:53.831 --> 33:55.423
Fracture sealed.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.865
44 megapascals!

34:00.138 --> 34:01.400
They're heating up
the warp core.

34:01.472 --> 34:03.406
They must be close
to initiating the shock burst.

34:03.474 --> 34:04.839
Everybody, take cover.

34:07.111 --> 34:10.137
47, 48, 49!

34:10.214 --> 34:11.681
Let's move!

34:24.629 --> 34:28.121
Well, in spite
of Tuvok's dire predictions,

34:28.199 --> 34:30.257
we haven't blown the ship
to pieces, have we?

34:30.333 --> 34:32.529
No, and radiation levels are
within acceptable tolerance.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.594
Good. Let's get in there
and see if we had any luck

34:34.672 --> 34:36.764
dispersing
this implosion ring.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.434
-Hold it.
-What?

34:39.510 --> 34:41.478
l'm reading a massive distortion
behind the door.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.449
l don't think
it's just behind the door.

34:45.516 --> 34:48.143
The ring's completely
engulfed Engineering.

34:54.692 --> 34:55.989
Can l talk to her?

34:56.060 --> 34:58.255
l can't guarantee
she'll hear you

34:58.329 --> 35:00.194
or be able to understand you
if she does.

35:03.034 --> 35:04.160
Captain.

35:07.405 --> 35:13.037
Talk... can't.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.442
What's wrong with her?

35:14.512 --> 35:16.412
lt's possible
the spatial distortions

35:16.481 --> 35:18.108
have damaged her speech center.

35:18.182 --> 35:22.243
But without my equipment,
l can't analyze...

35:22.320 --> 35:24.788
...her neural pathways.

35:24.856 --> 35:27.586
Chakotay, it didn't work.

35:27.658 --> 35:29.455
lnstead of forcing
the implosion outward,

35:29.527 --> 35:32.223
the pulse is drawing it in
at a faster rate.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.593
You're saying
it made things worse?

35:33.664 --> 35:35.427
l don't think we have
more than a few minutes.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.695
Paris, we have to get
to the navigational array

35:37.768 --> 35:39.099
and give Tuvok's plan a try.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.604
l'm afraid there's
no longer time for that.

35:41.672 --> 35:43.230
Why not?

35:49.147 --> 35:52.048
We're not going anywhere.

36:10.535 --> 36:12.628
Do you really think
it's possible to project

36:12.703 --> 36:14.295
a stable holographic
force field?

36:14.372 --> 36:16.033
We've tried everything else.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.165
Ready?

36:17.241 --> 36:20.108
Here we go.

36:27.451 --> 36:30.420
The distortion is unaffected
by the force field.

36:30.488 --> 36:33.150
We've got to figure out a way
to generate a stable field.

36:33.224 --> 36:34.316
B'Elanna,

36:34.392 --> 36:35.381
this ring has passed
through the shields,

36:35.459 --> 36:37.222
crushed the hull,
twisted the ship.

36:37.295 --> 36:38.762
We'll never get enough power

36:38.829 --> 36:40.592
from the holo-emitters
to stop it.

36:40.665 --> 36:43.065
What are you saying,
we're out of options?

36:43.134 --> 36:44.294
Perhaps not.

36:44.368 --> 36:47.166
So far we have been unsuccessful
in all our attempts

36:47.238 --> 36:49.604
to either explain or combat
this phenomenon,

36:49.674 --> 36:51.437
and according
to my calculations,

36:51.509 --> 36:53.101
the space
we are currently occupying

36:53.177 --> 36:56.442
will implode in approximately
three minutes, 17 seconds.

36:56.514 --> 36:58.209
You said there was
another option.

36:58.282 --> 37:00.273
We do nothing.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.375
Excuse me?

37:02.420 --> 37:04.615
Are you suggesting
we just let it crush us?

37:04.689 --> 37:06.054
Precisely.

37:07.091 --> 37:08.683
l can't believe
l'm hearing this from you.

37:08.759 --> 37:10.750
l agree-- it sounds
completely illogical.

37:10.828 --> 37:12.022
On the contrary.

37:12.096 --> 37:14.792
When every logical
course of action is exhausted,

37:14.865 --> 37:16.856
the option that remains
is inaction.

37:16.934 --> 37:18.162
So we're just supposed
to sit here

37:18.236 --> 37:19.168
and let this thing kill us?!

37:19.237 --> 37:20.499
l must point out

37:20.571 --> 37:23.472
that at least one attempt
we made to reverse the effect--

37:23.541 --> 37:25.839
the shock pulse--
only made our predicament worse.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.344
lf we continue desperately
improvising solutions,

37:28.412 --> 37:30.778
our own efforts
may ultimately kill us.

37:30.848 --> 37:33.316
On the other hand,
there is no definitive evidence

37:33.384 --> 37:35.909
to suggest that doing nothing
will result in death.

37:36.020 --> 37:39.251
lt's... talking... to... me!

37:39.323 --> 37:41.257
Do nothing.

37:41.325 --> 37:43.418
Captain, please lie down.

37:43.494 --> 37:45.462
What about the Captain?

37:45.529 --> 37:46.723
She's dying.

37:46.797 --> 37:48.355
We do not know that.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.332
At the moment,
she is merely delirious.

37:50.401 --> 37:53.268
Chakotay, you're in charge here.

37:53.337 --> 37:55.703
Don't you agree
we've got to keep trying?

37:55.773 --> 37:58.503
Whatever this thing is,
B'Elanna, it's bigger

37:58.576 --> 38:00.407
and more powerful than we are.

38:00.511 --> 38:02.672
Maybe...

38:02.713 --> 38:05.181
maybe this is one bear
we can't wrestle to the ground.

38:05.249 --> 38:07.717
Maybe like Tuvok says,
there's nothing we can do

38:07.785 --> 38:09.878
but let it happen
and hope for the best.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.391
Fine.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.865
Fine, Chakotay.

38:23.934 --> 38:26.232
Have it your way.

38:34.779 --> 38:37.077
Commander Chakotay.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.581
Yes, Mr. Tuvok?

38:38.649 --> 38:41.812
l want to thank you
for endorsing my recommendation.

38:41.886 --> 38:45.913
You know, Tuvok, l may not get
another chance to say this.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.118
Sometimes l find you
arrogant and irritating,

38:49.193 --> 38:51.491
but you're a hell of an officer.

38:51.562 --> 38:55.430
Thank you, sir, and since
we are speaking candidly,

38:55.499 --> 38:57.558
may l say, sir,
that l have not always been

38:57.635 --> 38:59.762
particularly partial
to your methods either.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.805
l suppose it must
have been tough for you

39:01.906 --> 39:04.636
to accept my being elevated
to First Officer over you.

39:04.675 --> 39:07.644
l have always respected
Captain Janeway's decisions.

39:07.712 --> 39:10.545
However, l suppose
that particular decision

39:10.614 --> 39:13.674
did put me in a position
l am unaccustomed to.

39:13.751 --> 39:16.686
lf that ever caused me to make
things more difficult for you,

39:16.754 --> 39:18.551
l must apologize.

39:33.904 --> 39:36.065
Can l ask you a question?

39:36.140 --> 39:38.700
Fire away, Harry.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.744
Are you afraid?

39:42.613 --> 39:45.241
l chose this life,

39:45.316 --> 39:49.582
and l guess l always knew
it could come to this...

39:49.653 --> 39:53.453
but, yeah, l'm afraid.

39:56.627 --> 39:58.254
Me, too.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.762
l'm so worried about Neelix.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.264
l should be with him.

40:02.333 --> 40:07.100
As much as he may...
annoy me at times,

40:07.171 --> 40:10.106
Mr. Neelix is one
of the most resourceful

40:10.174 --> 40:13.610
and resilient individuals
l know.

40:13.677 --> 40:18.637
lf anyone can survive
this calamity, he can.

40:42.373 --> 40:44.034
Hi.

40:45.743 --> 40:47.005
Hi.

40:47.144 --> 40:49.339
What are you doing?

40:51.081 --> 40:53.413
l'm trying to contact
my spirit guide.

40:53.484 --> 40:55.543
Why?

40:55.619 --> 40:59.248
Who knows what's going to happen
when that ring hits us?

40:59.323 --> 41:01.257
We might be in
for another long journey.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.720
l guess l could use

41:05.796 --> 41:09.129
a little spiritual guidance
myself right now.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.031
You mind if l join you?

41:11.101 --> 41:14.264
l thought you'd never ask.

42:46.196 --> 42:47.527
Captain?

42:52.036 --> 42:53.333
l'm all right.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.498
You were delirious.

42:56.574 --> 42:59.168
lt was...

42:59.243 --> 43:00.835
some sort of message.

43:00.945 --> 43:03.004
What was?

43:03.047 --> 43:06.073
The spatial distortion.

43:07.952 --> 43:09.920
lt was...

43:09.987 --> 43:12.820
trying to communicate with us.

43:16.794 --> 43:19.661
l want a full systems report,

43:19.730 --> 43:22.790
and Mr. Kim, Mr. Tuvok,
l want every iota of information

43:22.866 --> 43:25.266
that was recorded
regarding that phenomenon.

43:25.336 --> 43:27.600
The distortion ring
is directly ahead, Captain.

43:27.671 --> 43:30.071
lt's moving away from us
at 2,000 kph.

43:30.140 --> 43:32.631
We've got a full crew
complement, Captain.

43:32.710 --> 43:33.768
No injuries reported.

43:33.844 --> 43:35.937
No damage to the hull
or ship's systems.

43:36.013 --> 43:38.106
lncredible.

43:38.182 --> 43:40.150
You're not going
to believe this, Captain,

43:40.217 --> 43:42.811
but 20 million gigaquads
of new information

43:42.886 --> 43:44.979
have been input
into the ship's computer.

43:45.055 --> 43:46.989
Where did it come from?

43:47.057 --> 43:50.493
My guess is, it came
from the distortion ring.

43:50.561 --> 43:52.995
Somebody's definitely trying
to tell us something.

43:53.063 --> 43:54.655
That's not all, Captain.

43:54.732 --> 43:57.326
Our entire database has been
copied and downloaded

43:57.401 --> 43:59.335
into somebody else's system.

43:59.403 --> 44:00.893
l guess whoever they were,

44:01.005 --> 44:03.405
they want to know everything
they can about us, too.

44:03.440 --> 44:09.401
Maybe it was their only way
of communicating with us.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.914
Maybe...

44:11.982 --> 44:15.543
they were just trying
to say ''hello.''

44:15.619 --> 44:16.711
Cake anyone?

44:16.787 --> 44:18.778
Neelix, what happened to you?

44:18.856 --> 44:20.756
Oh, it's a long story.

44:20.824 --> 44:23.588
l'll tell you
all about it later.

44:23.661 --> 44:26.425
Right now, it's time
to finish your party.

44:26.497 --> 44:29.261
Neelix, l need
a photograph of you.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.561
What for, sweetie?

44:30.634 --> 44:32.932
From now on,
even when we're separated,

44:33.003 --> 44:35.699
l want to have you where
l can keep an eye on you.

44:37.241 --> 44:39.072
Happy birthday, Kes.
