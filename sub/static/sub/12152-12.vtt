<i>Previously on</i> Angel:

00:02.653 --> 00:05.213
LORNE: <i>Evil's coming.</i>
<i>And it's planning on staying.</i>

00:07.133 --> 00:08.122
Find that Beast.

00:10.573 --> 00:13.041
WESLEY:
<i>It won 't quit till everyone's dead.</i>

00:16.813 --> 00:18.212
Go underground,
change your name.

00:18.373 --> 00:21.683
<i>The Beast is planning to</i>
<i>block out the sun. Permanently.</i>

00:21.893 --> 00:24.088
Join with me, Angelus.

00:24.293 --> 00:27.091
- I'm telling you, I don't know this Beast.
- We need Angelus.

00:29.013 --> 00:30.924
WO-PANG: It is done.
CORDELIA: Angelus.

00:31.133 --> 00:33.647
GUNN: We're taking out Angel's soul,
putting it in a jar?

00:33.853 --> 00:34.968
Hope we know what we're doing.

00:35.173 --> 00:39.007
You wanna impress the girl. After a few
days of chocolate-covered cherries...

00:39.173 --> 00:41.971
...you'll bend her over
the kitchen counter...

00:43.573 --> 00:45.086
Tell me what
I just walked in on.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.164
Face it, you can't
give her what she needs.

00:47.973 --> 00:49.292
Charles! Stop it.

00:51.133 --> 00:52.168
Fred.

00:52.373 --> 00:55.365
You're still the same loser
no one would sit with at lunch.

00:55.573 --> 00:58.645
Yet you're locked in that cage
and I'm out here.

00:58.853 --> 00:59.922
Won't be here forever.

01:00.133 --> 01:01.964
He's told us everything he's going to.

01:02.173 --> 01:04.562
- We're putting your soul back.
- We'll see.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.923
FRED:
Angel's soul. It's gone.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.852
WO-PANG:
Must acquire better guards.

01:38.093 --> 01:40.607
Angel's soul has been stolen.

01:41.573 --> 01:43.882
I have no need for the vampire's soul.

01:44.373 --> 01:45.692
Then where is it?

01:51.413 --> 01:56.362
That I cannot discern.
But it is still viable within the Muo-ping.

01:56.573 --> 01:59.167
- "Muo" what?
- It's still safe in the container.

01:59.453 --> 02:03.890
Angel's soul has been misplaced. I bet
this sort of thing happens all the time.

02:04.053 --> 02:06.965
What do you have as
a backup plan to re-ensoul somebody?

02:07.133 --> 02:09.931
WO-PANG:
There is no other way known to me.

02:10.173 --> 02:13.768
Without the Muo-ping,
you're screwed.

02:14.733 --> 02:19.568
And what happens if the Muo...
Container thing breaks or gets opened?

02:20.293 --> 02:24.332
Then, like all things, the soul
can be returned or destroyed.

02:26.733 --> 02:28.610
ANGELUS:
<i>Awfully quiet up there.</i>

02:30.213 --> 02:35.845
<i>I've had time to think, and I've</i>
<i>realized something important:</i>

02:36.613 --> 02:39.411
Being evil is wrong.

02:39.573 --> 02:42.565
I wanna be good.
I wanna be Angel again.

02:42.773 --> 02:45.162
<i>You hear me? I'm ready.</i>

02:45.373 --> 02:46.647
I'm ready too, fang boy.

02:51.133 --> 02:54.091
He knows, doesn't he,
that his soul's missing?

02:54.293 --> 02:55.851
Probably knew before we did.

02:56.013 --> 02:59.323
- Hope that shaman can help us.
- He should've never been brought here.

02:59.493 --> 03:01.882
Now instead of just worrying about
the rock-eater...

03:02.053 --> 03:03.884
...we got Darth Vampire
in the basement.

03:04.053 --> 03:08.604
- Bringing Angelus was our best chance.
- That you talking or Wes?

03:08.773 --> 03:11.810
- You were pushing for it too.
- Then maybe I did the wrong thing.

03:11.973 --> 03:17.366
<i>Like smacking your girl around?</i>
<i>I bet you Wes would never hit her.</i>

03:17.533 --> 03:19.888
<i>He's all proper and English.</i>

03:20.653 --> 03:23.850
And that accent.
Chicks just love a good accent.

03:24.013 --> 03:26.732
Makes them all buttery
in their nether regions.

03:26.933 --> 03:28.412
<i>Isn 't that right, Fred?</i>

03:29.693 --> 03:32.924
<i>You know, I had a bit of an</i>
<i>Irish brogue back in the day.</i>

03:33.093 --> 03:37.291
<i>If you like, I can use it on you</i>
<i>when I rape you to death.</i>

03:38.613 --> 03:39.887
<i>Or...</i>

03:40.093 --> 03:42.527
Son of a bitch.

03:42.693 --> 03:44.923
He's just...

03:45.173 --> 03:46.526
It's just words.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.372
Yeah.

03:49.013 --> 03:54.371
And that's the only way he can hurt us.
He knows he's never getting out.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.612
Cavalry

05:03.053 --> 05:05.408
- The great Angelus.
- Oh, come on.

05:05.733 --> 05:09.931
You can do better than that. Try playing
up the awe and the reverence a bit.

05:10.093 --> 05:12.288
"The great Angelus."

05:12.773 --> 05:15.571
Great? Being locked in a cage?

05:15.773 --> 05:19.652
Yet managing to display better
grooming habits than you.

05:23.173 --> 05:25.812
Look at yourself, Lilah.

05:25.973 --> 05:28.282
All these years, wanting to meet me...

05:29.613 --> 05:33.572
Couldn't run a comb through your hair,
maybe slap on a little lipstick?

05:33.733 --> 05:36.805
Evil doesn't have to mean sloppy.

05:37.053 --> 05:40.284
- Stop it.
- Feeling touchy, are we?

05:40.453 --> 05:44.571
The Beast. I want you to stop it.

05:46.253 --> 05:47.447
Oh.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.490
Not sure I really want to.

05:49.653 --> 05:53.009
Don't get me wrong.
Not a big fan of the horn-job.

05:53.453 --> 05:56.650
But he did bring on permanent midnight.
Gotta give him props for that.

05:56.813 --> 05:58.371
Can you do it or not?

06:00.133 --> 06:04.570
Why is your thong in such a bunch,
counselor? You're a professional.

06:05.533 --> 06:10.243
Working the sewers.
Beast took everything. Killed them all.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.808
Saw the damage.
Does have a flair for it.

06:13.013 --> 06:15.083
Not just at the office. Everybody.

06:15.253 --> 06:18.802
Field ops, liaisons,
people out sick that day.

06:18.973 --> 06:22.045
But not me. Not yet.

06:22.253 --> 06:24.892
Why is he picking on us?
We're the bad guys.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.970
Apparently not bad enough.

06:27.173 --> 06:31.644
But there is a bright side. You have a
devoted boyfriend who loves and cares...

06:31.813 --> 06:33.929
Oh, wait.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.970
You don't.

06:36.173 --> 06:38.129
Your life really is crap.

06:38.413 --> 06:44.409
And yet I'm not the monkey in the box.
I want that thing destroyed.

06:46.133 --> 06:48.203
You're the only one who can do it.

06:48.933 --> 06:52.642
Maybe we can work something out.

06:54.973 --> 06:59.842
What Angelus said about me...
I didn't mean to hurt you.

07:00.013 --> 07:02.447
I would never do that.

07:02.613 --> 07:04.763
I know.

07:05.853 --> 07:08.321
I just can't help but
think if you didn't attack...

07:08.493 --> 07:11.803
Attack?
That's how you see it, I attacked him?

07:11.973 --> 07:14.362
What do you call what he was doing
before I came in?

07:14.533 --> 07:16.364
- I don't know why...
- He was kissing you.

07:17.813 --> 07:20.532
Don't lie to me.
It's the one thing you're not good at.

07:21.973 --> 07:25.170
- It just happened.
- Because you let it.

07:28.173 --> 07:30.129
I've never felt so much for anyone.

07:31.093 --> 07:33.687
I would do anything for you,
but it's not enough, is it?

07:34.613 --> 07:37.252
- Charles, l...
- We can't do this anymore, Fred.

07:39.173 --> 07:42.210
I'm tired of you looking
everywhere but at me.

07:46.573 --> 07:48.643
Like that.

07:53.093 --> 07:54.890
What is it?

07:55.813 --> 08:00.045
Just can't make heads or
tails out of this banishing text.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.444
- You guys have any luck?
- Yeah, but it was all bad.

08:03.653 --> 08:07.771
Shaman didn't have the soul, doesn't
know who took it, or how to find it.

08:07.973 --> 08:10.806
Other than that, everything's peachy.
Any word from Lorne?

08:10.973 --> 08:12.372
Damn it!

08:29.893 --> 08:32.726
Lilah. Ran off into the sewers.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.804
Connor, wait.

08:36.013 --> 08:40.131
You should stay here, make sure it isn't
a setup. There might be others.

08:59.173 --> 09:01.562
Check the locks.

09:05.013 --> 09:07.925
What kind of brain fart made that
witch try and let Angelus out?

09:08.093 --> 09:10.004
I wanna know how she
knew he was here.

09:10.173 --> 09:11.447
Maybe she took Angel's soul.

09:11.613 --> 09:14.252
She's a mucky-muck at
Wolfram and Hart. It's her job to know.

09:14.413 --> 09:16.973
I thought the Beast killed
everyone at Wolfram and Hart.

09:17.133 --> 09:19.806
Maybe she cut some kind of deal with it.

09:19.973 --> 09:23.488
You really think she has
a connection to the Beast?

09:31.253 --> 09:34.802
You're a son of a bitch,
you know that?

09:39.213 --> 09:41.727
When I said go underground,
I didn't think you'd...

09:43.613 --> 09:46.650
- Is that where the Beast...?
- Can't make it stop.

09:47.093 --> 09:50.210
- I can take a look at it.
- I'm fine.

09:54.693 --> 09:56.684
How did you know we had Angelus?

09:56.893 --> 10:01.205
Big magic, taking a champion's soul.
Makes ripples.

10:01.373 --> 10:03.728
I still know some people that like ripples.

10:04.373 --> 10:08.332
It was your idea, wasn't it?
To bring him?

10:09.253 --> 10:12.882
- Great minds...
- Aren't foolish enough to release him.

10:13.093 --> 10:15.561
- I wasn't.
- So the crowbar...?

10:15.733 --> 10:18.122
I had to make him believe
I was desperate.

10:18.333 --> 10:21.325
Not much of a stretch, really, is it?

10:22.573 --> 10:25.167
And you always wanted Angelus?

10:25.533 --> 10:28.730
No. Wolfram and Hart did,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

10:28.933 --> 10:30.286
I just...

10:31.733 --> 10:35.408
I just want my life back.
All my pretty things.

10:35.813 --> 10:38.168
I'm selfish that way.

10:38.333 --> 10:41.405
That's why we wouldn't have
worked out.

10:41.733 --> 10:44.964
There are many reasons we
wouldn't have worked out, Lilah.

10:59.813 --> 11:01.166
<i>Rheinhardt's Compendium</i> ?

11:01.333 --> 11:04.211
I need to find a way to make it pay.

11:04.933 --> 11:06.366
I've already checked.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.763
There's nothing in here
that even remotely...

11:08.933 --> 11:10.252
...describes...

11:11.493 --> 11:13.484
...him.

11:20.293 --> 11:23.524
It's identical to my copy,
except for this passage.

11:23.693 --> 11:25.092
How's that possible?

11:26.133 --> 11:27.486
It's not a local copy.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.970
Pulled some favors, got it on
the pan-dimensional black market.

11:32.173 --> 11:36.451
Still, it should be the exact same text.

11:37.933 --> 11:39.252
Unless...

11:39.893 --> 11:42.123
- Unless what?
- We'd have to check more books...

11:42.293 --> 11:45.968
...from other dimensions, but what if
there were references to the Beast...

11:46.133 --> 11:49.728
...at one time that
had somehow been removed?

11:52.013 --> 11:55.005
But what would something
that powerful need to hide?

11:56.413 --> 11:58.973
Lilah or not, something is
doing the Beast's dirty work.

11:59.133 --> 12:03.331
It would explain how Giant Lava Boy
could tiptoe past us to take out many.

12:03.493 --> 12:06.371
And butcher that family.
Those priestesses.

12:06.533 --> 12:10.162
Even though Lilah's evil, I don't
see her hacking up all those people.

12:10.333 --> 12:13.245
Okay, maybe it's not just her.
Maybe the big bad Beast...

12:13.413 --> 12:15.131
...has minions doing his dirty work.

12:15.293 --> 12:16.772
ANGELUS:
Morons.

12:16.973 --> 12:22.001
That big rock doesn't have minions.
It is the minion.

12:22.773 --> 12:25.287
No, it's not. We've seen what it can do.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.648
ANGELUS:
You've just seen the warm-up act.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.771
- What are you saying?
ANGELUS: There's something bigger.

12:31.773 --> 12:35.288
Something worse. The Beast...

12:35.453 --> 12:37.921
...has a boss.

12:42.853 --> 12:45.162
- Worse than the Beast?
- That's...

12:45.333 --> 12:46.812
That's not possible.

12:47.013 --> 12:50.085
How did you survive this long
being so retarded?

12:50.293 --> 12:52.488
Cut the Fu Manchu.
What do you know?

12:52.693 --> 12:55.765
Quite a bit, bright boy.

12:56.213 --> 12:58.727
Maybe I'll fill in the blanks sometime.

12:59.733 --> 13:01.530
How do you know there's
something worse?

13:01.693 --> 13:04.161
Because I have a brain, son.

13:04.613 --> 13:07.889
The Beast I knew was big
into smash and slaughter.

13:08.053 --> 13:11.489
Had the brawn to be really good
at it too. But the big picture?

13:11.933 --> 13:15.164
Not his strong point.
But flash forward.

13:15.373 --> 13:20.003
Now he's all rain of fire, destroying
the Ra-Tet, blotting out the sun.

13:20.213 --> 13:22.647
Big moves for a guy whose
head's made out of rock.

13:22.853 --> 13:24.366
Maybe he got smarter.

13:24.573 --> 13:27.770
And maybe I'll sprout some
wings and flutter away.

13:28.893 --> 13:32.852
There's something else out there.
More powerful, more vicious...

13:33.053 --> 13:34.406
...pulling all the strings.

13:35.013 --> 13:40.292
Ooh. I don't know about you,
but I'm just dying to find out what it is.

13:45.093 --> 13:46.970
What, no cake?

13:47.413 --> 13:49.005
- Where is it?
- Where is what?

13:49.213 --> 13:51.408
- Angel's soul.
- Oh, that what.

13:51.573 --> 13:53.484
- She didn't take it.
- How do you know?

13:53.693 --> 13:57.242
- Because she told me.
- You believe her? Lying's her job.

13:57.453 --> 13:59.762
He's got a point.

14:00.093 --> 14:03.051
- You wanna search me?
- What happened?

14:03.253 --> 14:05.403
She was hurt in the attack
on Wolfram and Hart.

14:05.613 --> 14:08.047
GUNN: Place was a slaughterhouse.
How'd she make it out?

14:08.213 --> 14:09.805
Got lucky.

14:10.693 --> 14:12.331
Maybe it was more than that.

14:13.613 --> 14:15.808
What were you doing downstairs
with Angelus?

14:16.013 --> 14:19.085
WESLEY: She was gathering intel.
GUNN: With a crowbar?

14:19.253 --> 14:21.209
She's the only one
to make it out alive...

14:21.373 --> 14:23.933
...then she shows up after
Angel's soul goes missing.

14:24.093 --> 14:25.924
I said she had nothing
to do with that.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.931
- Maybe she knows who did.
- Or who's controlling the Beast.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.886
- Controlling?
- Angelus thinks he's just the muscle.

14:32.173 --> 14:34.084
Not that I trust him any more than you.

14:34.253 --> 14:36.403
Everything that's happened
is part of a plan...

14:36.573 --> 14:39.485
...with something worse than
the Beast sketching the blueprints.

14:39.733 --> 14:42.247
That's what he's been trying to hide.

14:42.413 --> 14:44.608
- There might be something in the text...
- Text?

14:45.973 --> 14:48.487
Lilah found a passage
in <i>Rheinhardt's Compendium</i>.

14:48.653 --> 14:51.611
But we searched that already.
There's nothing in there.

14:51.813 --> 14:55.123
All references to the Beast
have been erased in this dimension.

14:55.933 --> 14:58.891
I got my copy of <i>Rheinhardt's</i>
way out of town.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.085
I'm surprised
you didn't think of that.

15:02.813 --> 15:04.690
That's why Angel
can't remember the Beast.

15:04.853 --> 15:07.208
His memory's been wiped clean
just like the books.

15:07.413 --> 15:08.812
Why does Angelus remember?

15:09.013 --> 15:12.369
Because his mind wasn't here when
the spell or whatever was cast, right?

15:12.573 --> 15:15.007
We should compare this passage
with the information...

15:15.173 --> 15:17.641
...Wolfram and Hart extracted
from Lorne. There might...

15:17.853 --> 15:20.048
Yeah, have fun with that.

15:20.293 --> 15:23.330
- Charles...
- Somebody needs to be downstairs.

15:23.493 --> 15:25.927
Make sure nobody else
tries to intel our boy.

15:29.413 --> 15:31.131
CORDELIA:
Let him go.

15:31.293 --> 15:34.205
I know this is hard.
I know we're all tired and hurting.

15:34.413 --> 15:35.846
But we have to stay focused.

15:37.333 --> 15:41.008
We need to figure out what's coming
and how to get Angel back before then.

15:41.173 --> 15:45.212
Because if this is as bad as I think it is,
we'll need him more than ever.

15:46.853 --> 15:50.641
You know what I like about you?
You play to your strengths.

15:50.813 --> 15:53.373
You know what they are
and you stick to them.

15:53.533 --> 15:56.001
You don't find that much these days.

15:56.173 --> 16:01.008
Everybody always trying to expand
their horizons, actuate their potential...

16:01.173 --> 16:06.566
...and all that other touchy-feely crap.
But not you. You don't try to change.

16:08.373 --> 16:10.409
Because you know your place.

16:12.453 --> 16:15.092
That'll go a long way towards
keeping you alive.

16:15.293 --> 16:17.284
Well, a lot longer than the others.

16:18.733 --> 16:21.566
Man, you guys really are on a streak.

16:22.333 --> 16:28.124
You let L.A. Nearly burn to the ground,
lost the sun, let the creepie-crawlies...

16:28.293 --> 16:30.648
...practically take over the city.

16:30.813 --> 16:32.405
But, you know, that's okay.

16:32.573 --> 16:36.327
At least you got the love
of a good woman.

16:36.533 --> 16:39.047
Till she dumps you for a guy with
a bigger horizon.

16:39.773 --> 16:42.048
- It's her life.
- Oh, wait.

16:42.933 --> 16:47.723
Did I miss it?
Did she already let you down easy?

16:47.893 --> 16:51.124
Cheer up, buddy.
Not like we didn't see it coming.

16:53.293 --> 16:55.853
Especially after what happened
to her old professor.

16:57.013 --> 17:00.688
Come on. Even Angel's not that stupid.

17:00.893 --> 17:03.532
The way things changed
between you two.

17:04.093 --> 17:07.368
The furtive looks. All that guilt.

17:07.653 --> 17:11.692
Mm. There's nothing like
your first murder.

17:12.292 --> 17:15.490
Don't worry. I won't tell
what our little girl did.

17:16.012 --> 17:19.528
- She didn't...
- Yeah! It was you.

17:19.693 --> 17:23.083
- Stepping up and being the man!
- I did what I had to do.

17:23.292 --> 17:27.047
I guess Fred didn't quite
see it that way. Wow.

17:27.252 --> 17:32.885
You do a chick a favor,
you'd think she'd be grateful. But no.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.328
She still goes for the broody smart guy...

17:35.493 --> 17:39.327
...all mysterious and tortured.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.808
I guess when you think about it,
for the first time in your life...

17:45.253 --> 17:47.164
...you just weren't dark enough.

17:54.213 --> 17:56.807
Maybe there's hope for you
after all, Chuck.

17:59.213 --> 18:00.726
FRED:
This is hopeless.

18:00.893 --> 18:04.602
The Orb of Thessulas is the only way
I can find to restore Angel's soul.

18:04.773 --> 18:07.845
But that only works if it's moved
on to an afterlife or something...

18:08.013 --> 18:10.049
...not floating in a jar somewhere.

18:13.653 --> 18:16.565
- We'll find a way to bring Angel back.
- How?

18:16.733 --> 18:21.204
The way we always do:
Skill, perseverance...

18:21.373 --> 18:22.886
Luck.

18:25.213 --> 18:28.091
Not a lot of that going around.

18:28.853 --> 18:32.289
- We'll be all right.
- As long as we stick together.

18:36.413 --> 18:38.210
Fred...

18:38.373 --> 18:40.170
What happened between
me and Gunn...

18:42.693 --> 18:44.285
I didn't mean...

18:45.653 --> 18:48.406
That's not what I wanted.

18:48.733 --> 18:50.052
Could you tell him that?

18:51.653 --> 18:53.609
I don't think he'll listen.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.369
We're not...

18:59.773 --> 19:02.287
We're not together anymore.

19:07.253 --> 19:08.572
Oh.

19:11.173 --> 19:12.731
Not because of what I did?

19:13.733 --> 19:16.770
Things just haven't been right.

19:17.453 --> 19:19.284
Not for a while.

19:25.253 --> 19:29.212
I think this is the part where
I'm supposed to say I'm sorry...

19:29.413 --> 19:32.883
...and I'm really trying to be, but...
LILAH: Any progress?

19:35.213 --> 19:37.568
- Not really.
- Pity.

19:38.253 --> 19:40.050
I made some headway
cross-referencing...

19:40.213 --> 19:43.091
...but no telling how long it'll take
to get anything definitive.

19:43.493 --> 19:45.131
But you've made some progress?

19:45.333 --> 19:47.767
Sure looks like he's trying.

19:50.373 --> 19:52.250
I'll relieve Gunn.

19:52.413 --> 19:54.847
See if I can get anything else
out of Angelus.

19:56.693 --> 19:59.161
So, what now? Ouija board?

20:00.453 --> 20:03.763
Lorne. Did you find out anything?

20:03.973 --> 20:07.648
Zip. Zilch. And what in the
hell is Succubitch doing here?

20:07.853 --> 20:11.448
Still trying to figure that out.
So nothing?

20:11.613 --> 20:14.730
Talked to every contact that
hasn't beat it for higher ground.

20:14.893 --> 20:16.849
Nobody's heard Bo Peep
about Angel's soul.

20:17.013 --> 20:18.605
Forget about the goody-goody.

20:18.773 --> 20:21.924
You wanna kill the Beast and
give his boss a run for his evil?

20:22.133 --> 20:25.125
The answer is downstairs in a cage.
Sic Angelus on him.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.563
You know what Angelus
would do if we let him out?

20:28.173 --> 20:32.485
Kill you all in a bloody shower of
violence, but hey. Greater good.

20:32.693 --> 20:35.526
We'll find another way.
I'm sure if we just all...

20:35.693 --> 20:38.161
What? Hold hands and sing a hymn?

20:38.373 --> 20:41.126
Might be hard when
the Beast is ripping your guts out.

20:43.733 --> 20:46.805
Lilah, I know things look grim right now.

20:47.013 --> 20:50.642
Don't go Watchtower on me, Saint
Cordelia. I don't think I could stomach it.

20:51.173 --> 20:54.609
Man, I'd love to punch your face in.

20:56.293 --> 20:58.523
Are you trying to turn me on?

20:59.173 --> 21:03.644
What's sad about people like you, Lilah,
it all comes down to fear.

21:04.053 --> 21:06.931
Fascinating.
Now that we've got that settled.

21:07.093 --> 21:10.881
You're too scared to believe in anything
because you're too scared to hope.

21:11.053 --> 21:13.328
You won't even open your
eyes to the possibility.

21:14.853 --> 21:18.050
You don't get it, do you, Twinkie?
I'm what I believe in.

21:18.533 --> 21:21.206
You think I got this far
by sticking my head in the sand?

21:21.533 --> 21:24.127
The Beast that eviscerated me
has a boss.

21:24.293 --> 21:28.047
That boss is gonna end life as we know
it, and nobody is coming to save us.

21:28.213 --> 21:31.967
Not Angel, not the Powers That Be
and not the 40-damn-2nd Cavalry.

21:32.133 --> 21:35.284
So if anybody has scales
on their eyes...

21:38.333 --> 21:39.607
...it's you.

21:39.893 --> 21:43.932
I can bring him back.
I know how to re-ensoul Angel.

21:57.693 --> 22:00.890
Hey, we were just talking about you.
At least I was, anyway.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.851
- What is it?
- Cordelia had a vision.

22:04.013 --> 22:06.402
She knows how to put his soul back.

22:07.933 --> 22:10.572
I guess the Powers saw how bad
you guys suck.

22:11.013 --> 22:13.481
- Doing better than you.
- Fred...

22:13.653 --> 22:16.725
She really has put on the spunk,
hasn't she, Wes?

22:16.933 --> 22:20.209
Not the same shy bitch-cow
we pulled out of Pylea.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.762
There's only one bitch here
and I'm looking at him.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.806
Oh. Come on, we all know
it's for the best.

22:25.973 --> 22:27.645
Now you can go for the real prize.

22:29.173 --> 22:32.210
Yeah, I'm telling you.
Man, if I swung that way...

22:32.413 --> 22:37.043
Look at him.
All rugged and handsome.

22:37.253 --> 22:40.404
And brains.
Man, he's damn near perfect.

22:40.573 --> 22:42.723
Thank you.

22:43.533 --> 22:47.048
Except the part about banging Lilah
for the past six months.

22:47.813 --> 22:49.405
That kind of takes the shine off.

22:54.133 --> 22:55.646

22:58.053 --> 22:59.964
No.

23:00.133 --> 23:02.488

You sure this is the right spot?

23:15.333 --> 23:18.405
GUNN: Well, the landmarks look like
what Cordy described in her vision.

23:18.613 --> 23:20.251
Never fought a soul eater before.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.091
And I'm not planning to.

23:22.253 --> 23:25.370
Cordy said it was buried by the
Chumash a couple hundred years ago.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.085
Don't expect too much of a fight.

23:29.733 --> 23:34.682
- So, what if we can't find it?
- Then we're screwed.

23:35.213 --> 23:38.410
The skull of the soul eater is the
main piece of the scalp Cordy saw.

23:38.573 --> 23:40.803
Without that...

23:41.813 --> 23:43.087
Clear it off.

You okay?

24:05.253 --> 24:09.007
I so don't need that kind of crap.
Let's just chop his head off and...

24:09.773 --> 24:12.128
Okay, this thing is really
starting to piss me off.

Nice.

Yeah, sometimes you just
gotta keep whacking.

- You think it'll work?
- It better.

25:12.133 --> 25:14.124
If there's something
worse than the Beast...

25:14.333 --> 25:16.608
...we gotta get Angel back
before it shows up.

25:19.293 --> 25:22.046

wings? Not in the job description.

for three sacred talons.

Never do I have the
happy, frolicking puppy visions.

Always bones and death and...

26:03.893 --> 26:05.929
We got the skull of the soul eater.

26:07.133 --> 26:10.205
- I'm just saying.
- It looks rather fresh.

26:10.413 --> 26:13.530
- Yeah, we moved up its expiration date.
LORNE: Cordy?

26:21.493 --> 26:24.132
I just see the skull.

26:24.293 --> 26:26.329
It doesn't have any...

26:26.613 --> 26:29.252
You know, parts.

26:29.893 --> 26:33.283
Right. Take it to the kitchen,
remove the flesh and the soft tissue.

except "Suits by Liberace."

Wesley, would you please warn
this walking infection...

26:43.973 --> 26:47.283
...that I haven't forgotten how she
poked my head open like a Capri Sun.

26:47.453 --> 26:50.729
And while my love for humanity allows
me to tolerate her presence...

26:50.893 --> 26:55.205
...if need be, I will smack her down.
Be a doll. Thanks.

26:59.773 --> 27:02.492
All the excitement, I thought
you would've escaped by now.

27:02.973 --> 27:07.251
Well, I would've,
but it's Thursday, which means...

27:07.413 --> 27:11.452
...everyone who should be in
the weekly briefing is dead.

27:12.253 --> 27:14.642

Powers That Be are all hat and no cattle.

And if they do pull it through, well,
then braid my hair and call me Pollyanna.

Have you all lost your mind?

You're gonna use black magic
to restore my soul.

People, this never goes well.
Am I the only one paying attention?

27:59.733 --> 28:03.123
Ten-to-one the entire hotel gets
sucked into a hell dimension.

- Talk about 11 th-hour desperation.

Face it, you're grasping.
No jar, no soul.

28:11.573 --> 28:14.565
- Sound pretty desperate yourself.
- Do you have the vial?

Even if your precious champion...

28:17.973 --> 28:21.170
...makes another guest appearance,
you can't stop the Apocalypse.

you never stood a chance.

let me out? Because he finally gave up.

He knew you were all too weak
and selfish to stop what's coming.

because he gave up on you.

30:13.413 --> 30:16.883
You came down the stairs.
You had blood and I grabbed...

30:17.733 --> 30:19.371
I'm fine.

30:22.293 --> 30:25.444
- The spell, it worked. I feel it.
- We have to be sure.

30:25.973 --> 30:27.691
Get Lorne to read him.

30:28.973 --> 30:31.851
Angel, are you aware of
what's happened?

30:32.773 --> 30:34.968
I'm back.

30:35.853 --> 30:39.289
There's something else.

30:39.453 --> 30:41.887
- Something worse, worse than the...
- The Beast. Yes.

30:42.093 --> 30:45.449
And we need your help to fight it.
But first you have to sing for Lorne.

30:48.053 --> 30:49.532
I...

30:49.733 --> 30:51.405
To prove it's really you.

30:53.693 --> 30:55.012
Oh.

30:55.453 --> 30:56.727
Right.

[SINGING "RAINDROPS KEEP
FALLING ON MY HEAD"]

31:09.733 --> 31:14.170
Yes! Yes! Sweet fancy
B.J. Thomas, it's him! It's Angel!

31:14.333 --> 31:16.847
- You sure?
- Yes, yes. The aura's totally changed.

31:17.013 --> 31:19.527
And the vibes scream soul!

31:20.853 --> 31:24.846
Oh, bless you and your beautiful
LAN line to the P.T.B., honey.

31:25.533 --> 31:27.444
He's back.

31:28.173 --> 31:31.085
- Then we can let him out.
- No.

31:31.253 --> 31:33.403
I'm staying.
Doing what's best for the group.

31:33.613 --> 31:36.252
Since when is locking up the
leader best for the group?

31:36.453 --> 31:39.411
Since when does your vision
come with a guarantee?

31:40.133 --> 31:44.570
For all we know, this spell...

31:44.733 --> 31:46.212
...is only temporary.

31:47.093 --> 31:49.766
And God forbid...

31:51.213 --> 31:53.932
I can give orders from down in here.

31:54.093 --> 31:57.802
The new ones are: No more backbiting,
fistfighting, fraternizing or vengeance.

31:57.973 --> 32:01.932
From now on you focus on one thing:
Making it out alive.

32:02.093 --> 32:07.247
Because I'm only gonna say this once:
What Angelus told you was a lie.

32:07.413 --> 32:10.610
I haven't and will never
give up on you.

32:11.533 --> 32:14.570
We'll get through this thing. Together.

32:15.973 --> 32:18.362
Can't believe we didn't
crush you people years ago.

32:18.533 --> 32:22.890
Wes and Fred, get back to Lilah's books.
We need information on this new player.

32:23.053 --> 32:26.284
Lilah, make some coffee.
Earn your keep around here. Lorne...

32:26.653 --> 32:30.566
...I want you out working real estate.
If this thing is bigger than the Beast...

32:30.733 --> 32:33.201
...it'll lay down roots
and it'll need square footage.

32:33.373 --> 32:34.806
Good to have you back, boss.

32:34.973 --> 32:38.727
In the meantime,
Connor, Gunn, work damage control.

32:38.933 --> 32:42.972
Sweep the surrounding blocks
for civilians, save who you can.

32:44.413 --> 32:45.732
Connor, it's me.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.166
I know.

32:50.293 --> 32:51.487
Cordy?

32:52.933 --> 32:55.128
- No.
- I didn't say anything.

32:55.493 --> 32:59.008
True. But I thought I should tell
you up front that I don't take orders...

32:59.173 --> 33:02.051
...from guys too scared
to step out of their cages.

33:07.253 --> 33:10.484
I made the right call.
This way everybody stays safe.

33:10.693 --> 33:14.527
And you don't have to look
anyone in the eyes. Bonus.

33:18.493 --> 33:20.563
I hate that you saw me like that.

33:23.733 --> 33:26.452
Guess it's only fair.

33:26.613 --> 33:31.209
Angelus said you saw me at one of
my not-most-shining moments.

33:33.973 --> 33:36.168
Besides...

33:36.373 --> 33:38.568
...you're not him.

33:39.013 --> 33:41.083
You think we don't get that, but we do.

33:45.533 --> 33:47.285
What if...?

33:47.453 --> 33:50.013
What if the spell doesn't last?

33:50.213 --> 33:52.852
The Powers need a champion, Angel.

33:53.013 --> 33:56.642
And obviously they need one pretty bad,
the way things are going.

33:57.373 --> 34:01.764
Who knows? You might even be
their only hope, Obi-Wan.

34:06.813 --> 34:08.371
So how do I go up there?

34:10.172 --> 34:12.322
Easy.

34:18.172 --> 34:24.009
Leave him and what you did
inside the cage.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.085
You're not Angelus.

34:48.493 --> 34:49.766
Guess again.

Stay down!

Sorry if I scared you.

35:23.813 --> 35:25.644
Angel. I thought...

35:25.973 --> 35:27.452
Cordy let me out.

35:28.093 --> 35:34.123
Actually, I asked her to be let out.
You know what? Never mind.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.052
No, wait.

35:37.213 --> 35:39.681
I'm the one who's sorry.

35:39.853 --> 35:43.129
After everything you've
been through, I...

35:46.253 --> 35:48.369
It has been a little rough.

35:48.773 --> 35:52.402
- On all of us. The stress is...
- I know I could use a drink.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.565
Now, you see?
That's what I was afraid of.

35:59.293 --> 36:03.206
For the rest of your life
you'll only see this evil thing.

36:06.013 --> 36:10.564
You're my friend, Angel.
Past is past and done is done.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.732
Thanks, Fred.

36:15.653 --> 36:17.006
Can I get a hug?

It's my inner megalomaniac.
I rebel at serving coffee.

36:29.453 --> 36:32.490
- Angel, I thought you were confined to...
- Change in plans.

36:32.693 --> 36:36.049
Cordy talked me out of staying down
there. Now I've got my own mission.

36:36.253 --> 36:37.811
- Which is?
- Too dangerous, son.

36:37.973 --> 36:39.691
I'm afraid you can't go with me.

36:44.053 --> 36:46.613
I have to go save the world.

36:50.693 --> 36:55.130
So has anyone seen Cordy?

36:58.253 --> 37:00.244
Connor's on point.
Three-party follow-up.

37:00.413 --> 37:02.244
Me, Wes and Fred in the truck.
Cordy?

37:02.453 --> 37:04.489
I don't understand how
the spell didn't work.

37:04.653 --> 37:07.884
- Dud <i>ex machina</i>. There's a surprise.
- Cordy.

37:09.613 --> 37:11.683
We'll be fine. Go.

37:12.533 --> 37:14.728
He'll want to feed. A lot.

37:14.893 --> 37:17.726
Our only advantage is,
he might think we want to capture him.

37:17.933 --> 37:19.685
We're all agreed
that's not an option.

37:19.853 --> 37:22.321
Angelus is loose because
we brought him in this world.

37:22.773 --> 37:24.445
It's our job to take him out of it.

37:25.973 --> 37:29.090
Take the shot. Any shot you can get.

37:29.373 --> 37:30.806
Now you're playing my song.

37:31.813 --> 37:33.326
- I don't know if l...
- You will.

37:33.493 --> 37:36.565
Let's go, while his trail's still hot.

37:47.453 --> 37:50.445
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
Where's the fun in that?

38:01.173 --> 38:03.892
What happened to pedestrians?
Human pedestrians?

38:04.093 --> 38:06.971
Is there no fast food
left in Los Angeles?

38:08.693 --> 38:12.368
And he let me think
I was talking him into it.

38:12.533 --> 38:16.412
Those evil geniuses. Get you every time.

38:16.933 --> 38:20.972
The Beast and then Angelus
and now there's something worse.

38:22.573 --> 38:25.326
- I thought the spell was...
- Divine intervention?

38:27.093 --> 38:32.008
Trust me, you have more chances of
winning the lottery six times in a row.

38:32.173 --> 38:33.526
I had the numbers done.

38:35.733 --> 38:39.248
- It just makes me question...
ANGELUS: What's it all for?

38:39.413 --> 38:41.768
I would too, if I were about to die.

39:38.853 --> 39:40.206

39:40.853 --> 39:42.923
- What doesn't?
- Angelus would want to feed.

39:43.093 --> 39:47.325
But his scent ends here
and it's not a highly populated area.

39:47.493 --> 39:50.291
It ends here? Somebody pick him up?

39:50.453 --> 39:52.523
He'd go where he could
wreak the most damage.

39:52.853 --> 39:56.243
Which doesn't necessarily
mean highly populated.
