00:09.334 --> 00:12.834
* you won't admit
you love me *

00:12.901 --> 00:14.501
* and so *

00:14.567 --> 00:17.133
* how am i ever *

00:17.200 --> 00:18.934
* to know? *

00:19.000 --> 00:21.734
* you always tell me *

00:21.801 --> 00:24.868
* perhaps, perhaps, perhaps *

00:26.200 --> 00:27.334
* perhaps *

00:28.400 --> 00:29.567
* perhaps *

00:30.734 --> 00:32.334
* perhaps *

00:35.968 --> 00:39.067
are you two absolutely certain
you're not pregnant?

00:40.567 --> 00:43.968
you know, we've got to
develop a new form of greeting.

00:48.734 --> 00:50.834
you're not.
are you sure?

00:50.901 --> 00:52.400
sally, deep breath.

00:52.467 --> 00:54.267
if you stare long enough
at that window,

00:54.334 --> 00:55.634
you can make
a blue line appear.

00:55.701 --> 00:58.701
yeah. i think that's
how i prefer to do it.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.968
test-wise, jane,
you'd be skipping
a vital step.

01:02.033 --> 01:04.534
well, aren't you
mrs. knowledgeable
all of a sudden.

01:05.567 --> 01:07.434
are you and steve
trying for a baby?

01:07.501 --> 01:10.367
i just know
you're supposed to
pee on the end.

01:10.434 --> 01:12.801
what--for luck?

01:12.868 --> 01:15.133
i'm talking about
the <i>test,</i> jane.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.067
okay.

01:17.133 --> 01:19.667
you know what happens now?
you do another test?

01:19.734 --> 01:22.234
could have been faulty.
it can happen.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.400
and i do think there's
a hint of a line there.

01:26.133 --> 01:27.667
go for it.

01:27.734 --> 01:29.334
this time i need your help.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.534
the mind reels in a number
of unpleasant directions.

01:32.601 --> 01:34.467
if you two are sure
you're not pregnant,

01:34.534 --> 01:37.000
you can be my control tests.

01:37.067 --> 01:39.634
is this really necessary?

01:39.701 --> 01:41.267
come on, please.
it could be fun.

01:41.334 --> 01:43.501
on the other hand,
it could be peeing
on a stick.

01:43.567 --> 01:45.667
frankly, there's
a built-in fun limit.

01:45.734 --> 01:46.934
exactly.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.767
there isn't even room
to write your name.

01:53.767 --> 01:55.501
sally:
are you guys done yet?

01:58.033 --> 02:00.267
there you go.
thank you, susan.

02:02.567 --> 02:03.801
jane?

02:03.868 --> 02:06.300
there isn't even room
to write your initials.

02:06.367 --> 02:08.199
jane, please.

02:08.267 --> 02:11.701
it just feels
so impersonal.

02:11.767 --> 02:13.167
how long does it take?

02:13.234 --> 02:15.100
generally under a minute.

02:15.167 --> 02:18.100
you just know
so much about this.

02:18.167 --> 02:20.100
it's like you're
suddenly earth mother,

02:20.167 --> 02:21.667
without the breasts.

02:21.734 --> 02:25.067
i'm glad you're the one
with the breasts, jane.

02:25.133 --> 02:27.868
i'd hate anyone
to get us mixed up.

02:27.934 --> 02:30.300
do people really call me
"the one with breasts"?

02:30.367 --> 02:31.767
absolutely.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.567
what do they call you?

02:33.634 --> 02:35.634
susan.

02:35.701 --> 02:38.267
( sally shrieks )
sally, what's happened?

02:38.334 --> 02:39.601
sally: blue line!

02:39.667 --> 02:41.734
absolutely,
definitely blue line!

02:41.801 --> 02:43.501
blue line baby alert!
oh, my god!

02:43.567 --> 02:45.601
oh, my god!
oh, my god!

02:45.667 --> 02:47.601
oh, my god!
oh, my god!

02:47.667 --> 02:50.100
is it a boy
or a girl?

02:50.167 --> 02:52.234
kind of early days, jane.

02:52.300 --> 02:55.100
it's so blue
and liney!

02:55.167 --> 02:56.834
it's really liney!

02:56.901 --> 02:59.968
it's like a whole blue line
of blue lineyness!

03:00.033 --> 03:02.300
let me look at it.
i'm sure it's not--

03:02.367 --> 03:05.434
oh, my god!
oh, my god!
oh, my god!

03:05.501 --> 03:07.067
oh, my god!
oh, my god!

03:07.133 --> 03:08.534
which one's mine?
can i see mine?

03:08.601 --> 03:10.400
one of those two.
which one?

03:10.467 --> 03:11.968
i don't know.

03:12.033 --> 03:13.334
my god, susan.
oh, my god.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.601
you don't know?

03:14.667 --> 03:16.734
does it matter?
i'm the one who's pregnant.

03:16.801 --> 03:18.400
susan, what am i
going to do?

03:18.467 --> 03:20.300
i'm sorry--
you don't know?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.267
will you two shut up
about your tests?

03:22.334 --> 03:23.801
i'm going to have a baby!

03:23.868 --> 03:24.934
sally--

03:25.000 --> 03:27.300
a bald, noisy thing with eyes

03:27.367 --> 03:29.601
is going to climb
out of my genitals

03:29.667 --> 03:30.968
and destroy my life!

03:31.033 --> 03:33.167
and my mother
is going to side with it!

03:33.234 --> 03:35.534
sally, just as
a matter of interest,

03:35.601 --> 03:37.334
you are certain
this is your test?

03:37.400 --> 03:38.567
of course i'm certain.

03:38.634 --> 03:39.701
good.
right.

03:39.767 --> 03:43.400
look--it's got
a blue line on it.

03:43.467 --> 03:46.167
how do you know the one with
the blue line on it is yours?

03:46.234 --> 03:48.968
because i'm pregnant,
you fool!

03:49.033 --> 03:51.434
and just supposing
you <i>weren't</i> the one
who was pregnant?

03:51.501 --> 03:54.434
then this wouldn't
be my test, would it?

03:56.367 --> 03:57.667
right.

03:57.734 --> 03:59.234
yes.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.567
funny thing, actually.
in fact--

04:03.000 --> 04:06.434
you see, i had
all three tests

04:06.501 --> 04:07.901
in my hand,

04:07.968 --> 04:10.868
and i was really keen
to find out the terrible truth,

04:10.934 --> 04:14.767
and i was surrounded
by the whole mad cubicle--

04:14.834 --> 04:16.267
sally.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.666
anyone ready
to go again yet?

04:23.000 --> 04:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:32.934 --> 04:35.734
i suppose we need to find
an all-night chemist.

04:35.801 --> 04:37.033
yeah, i suppose.

04:37.100 --> 04:40.133
and potentially
some kind of...

04:40.200 --> 04:41.300
father?

04:41.367 --> 04:42.868
yeah.

04:42.934 --> 04:43.901
shit.

04:43.968 --> 04:45.000
what?

04:46.167 --> 04:48.601
susan?

04:48.667 --> 04:51.868
only fair to tell you--
one of you guys is pregnant.

04:51.934 --> 04:54.334
it's not me.
you don't know that.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.200
yeah, 'cause even if
you've had your period--

04:56.267 --> 04:58.734
you don't understand.
it can't be me.

04:58.801 --> 05:00.200
what do you mean,
"can't"?

05:00.267 --> 05:02.234
i mean, steve and i can't.

05:02.300 --> 05:06.033
so...something's...wrong?

05:06.100 --> 05:08.000
clearly.

05:08.067 --> 05:10.367
you have been trying, then?

05:10.434 --> 05:13.501
we never really got round
to organizing a wedding.

05:13.567 --> 05:16.534
thought maybe a whole
human being would be easier.

05:16.601 --> 05:18.367
so we had the conversation.

05:18.434 --> 05:19.667
the conversation?

05:19.734 --> 05:21.801
you know,
the baby conversation.

05:24.901 --> 05:27.133
susan, do we do anything
about birth control?

05:27.200 --> 05:29.200
don't worry about it.

05:29.267 --> 05:31.067
okay.

05:32.300 --> 05:35.267
a few months later,
we went to see someone.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.133
just to get ourselves
checked out.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.267
if you're gonna
marry someone,

05:39.334 --> 05:41.334
you want to make sure
everything's in...

05:41.400 --> 05:43.000
working order.

05:43.067 --> 05:45.901
man: so, how long
have you been trying?

05:45.968 --> 05:48.534
we haven't, really.
six months.

05:51.133 --> 05:54.067
so we got ourselves
checked out properly.

05:54.133 --> 05:56.701
you mean you went
to one of those places

05:56.767 --> 05:58.367
where men go into--

05:58.434 --> 06:00.400
into a cup, yeah.

06:00.467 --> 06:03.100
i had a dream about
one of those places.

06:03.167 --> 06:04.634
oh, i'm sure you did.

06:04.701 --> 06:07.033
all the storage vats exploded,

06:07.100 --> 06:09.634
and it was up to me
to save the town.

06:12.801 --> 06:15.367
anyway...

06:15.434 --> 06:18.300
oh, i'm sorry.
i'm looking for
steve taylor.

06:20.534 --> 06:22.234
ha ha ha ha!

06:22.300 --> 06:24.968
steve taylor.
is he here?

06:25.033 --> 06:29.200
um, cubicle eight.
ha ha ha ha ha!

06:30.567 --> 06:32.167
is there a problem?

06:32.234 --> 06:35.434
no! no! ha ha ha!

06:41.868 --> 06:43.634
steve.

06:44.934 --> 06:46.968
hello, darling.

06:47.033 --> 06:48.067
hello.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.467
something wrong?

06:49.534 --> 06:52.667
you've been in there
for an hour and a half!

06:52.734 --> 06:55.300
about that, yeah.

06:55.367 --> 06:57.300
about that.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.467
how did you know that?

06:59.534 --> 07:02.033
steve, they <i>phoned</i> me.

07:03.534 --> 07:05.133
oh.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.501
so...

07:08.567 --> 07:10.167
how's it going?

07:10.234 --> 07:13.601
well, you know--
early days.

07:16.167 --> 07:17.601
early days.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.634
how quickly do you
think i can do this?

07:19.701 --> 07:22.667
no offense, darling,
but really quite quickly.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.667
well, i've gotta...
get in the mood.

07:25.734 --> 07:28.000
what, there's
a particular mood
for this?

07:28.067 --> 07:30.501
of course
there's a mood!

07:30.567 --> 07:33.334
okay, well,
maybe i can help.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.100
um...

07:35.167 --> 07:38.334
darling, i'm just stepping out
to the shops for an hour.

07:40.267 --> 07:43.367
and i don't like the porn.
you what?!

07:43.434 --> 07:45.801
they've got porn here.
i don't like it.

07:45.868 --> 07:47.334
it's got blokes in it.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.400
i'm against blokes in porn,
there should be only women.

07:50.467 --> 07:52.200
possibly with
some women friends, or--

07:52.267 --> 07:54.501
oh, god, not
the lesbian thing again!

07:54.567 --> 07:55.501
once and for all,

07:55.567 --> 07:57.567
what is so special
about lesbians?

07:57.634 --> 08:01.267
lesbians are
porn efficient.

08:03.968 --> 08:06.200
it's sex with a greater
density of women.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.067
porn-wise,

08:08.133 --> 08:10.868
lesbians are like a jam sandwich
without the sandwich

08:10.934 --> 08:12.501
and just the jam.

08:12.567 --> 08:16.067
in fact, lesbians are just
a big blob of jam.

08:17.167 --> 08:18.701
well, not actually.

08:18.767 --> 08:23.434
unless they've exploded
in all the lesbonic excitement.

08:24.567 --> 08:25.734
Jeff--

08:25.801 --> 08:28.267
also, in bloke-driven porn,
you run the risk

08:28.334 --> 08:31.400
of potentially dangerous
eye slippage.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.701
eye slippage?

08:33.767 --> 08:36.667
if, in the climactic seconds,

08:36.734 --> 08:38.767
your eye slips from
the girl to the bloke,

08:38.833 --> 08:42.100
the sudden shock
can cause a whiplash event.

08:42.167 --> 08:43.601
and trust me,

08:43.667 --> 08:47.267
lower whiplash is not an injury
you want to have to explain

08:47.334 --> 08:49.234
while you're being
stretchered out

08:49.300 --> 08:52.367
through your mother's
coffee morning.

08:52.434 --> 08:55.167
obviously Jeff's
more than averagely acquainted

08:55.234 --> 08:56.801
with some of these issues.

08:56.868 --> 08:59.601
steve, Jeff is more
than averagely <i>here.</i>

08:59.667 --> 09:03.934
i had to send out
for more suitable...
material.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.434
you sent out?

09:06.501 --> 09:09.534
well, they don't have
any kind of porn menu here.

09:09.601 --> 09:12.100
i don't even think
they knew what i meant.

09:16.634 --> 09:18.934
that's your pillow.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.434
yes.

09:24.901 --> 09:27.767
no, i mean <i>your</i> pillow.
from your bed at home.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.300
yeah, i got Jeff
to get that, too.

09:30.367 --> 09:33.834
it's my favorite pillow.
i always use this pillow.

09:38.367 --> 09:40.067
what do you
do with it?

09:40.133 --> 09:42.033
nothing, it's just
for my head.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.634
his <i>main</i> head.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.701
thank you for
the clarification,
Jeff.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.067
oh, steve!

09:50.133 --> 09:51.734
is something wrong, dear?

09:51.801 --> 09:53.267
is something wrong?

09:53.334 --> 09:55.400
you've asked trained
medical professionals

09:55.467 --> 09:56.701
for a porn menu!

09:56.767 --> 10:00.234
you've sent out for lesbians!
and a comfort pillow!

10:00.300 --> 10:03.267
and if that wasn't strange
and alarming enough, Jeff!

10:05.100 --> 10:07.701
why didn't you just
ask patrick along
while you're at it?

10:21.734 --> 10:25.868
hello, susan!
what are you doing here?

10:25.934 --> 10:27.400
patrick gave me a lift.

10:27.467 --> 10:31.400
i was maybe a little vague
about what exactly went on here,

10:31.467 --> 10:33.334
and he got
a bit excited.

10:33.400 --> 10:37.367
don't think i've ever seen a man
look so disappointed by a cup.

10:37.434 --> 10:39.634
you didn't really think
you got to have sex

10:39.701 --> 10:41.200
with one of the nurses,
did you?

10:41.267 --> 10:43.501
i did.

10:43.567 --> 10:46.701
patrick, you are
a sad and twisted man.

10:46.767 --> 10:48.300
no, susan--

10:48.367 --> 10:50.534
he...did.

10:54.701 --> 10:56.334
no, no, no, no.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.133
i just got her phone number,
that's all.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.033
you should have seen
the look she gave him,
though!

11:01.100 --> 11:03.133
the full-on patrick effect!

11:03.200 --> 11:05.334
when patrick
walks these corridors,

11:05.400 --> 11:07.767
every sperm in the building
pricks up its ears--

11:07.834 --> 11:09.601
"the mothership!

11:09.667 --> 11:13.000
i hear the call
of the mothership!"

11:13.067 --> 11:15.667
that doesn't actually happen.

11:15.734 --> 11:18.534
a week after sally
tells you she loves you,

11:18.601 --> 11:20.133
and you're getting
some girl's phone number!

11:20.200 --> 11:23.534
we were talking,
she's a nurse.
it was automatic.

11:23.601 --> 11:26.534
have you phoned sally yet?
no.

11:26.601 --> 11:28.133
well, phone her soon,
patrick.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.367
or, no offense,
i'll rip your throat out.

11:31.434 --> 11:33.801
why is everything
always so difficult
with you?

11:33.868 --> 11:35.133
other people just do things.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.200
with you, everything
is a major problem.

11:38.267 --> 11:39.834
it's not my fault.

11:39.901 --> 11:41.834
it's <i>never</i> your fault.

11:41.901 --> 11:44.167
it's this place.

11:44.234 --> 11:46.267
it's too wholesome.

11:46.334 --> 11:48.501
look, it's wrong
for masturbation.

11:48.567 --> 11:52.267
masturbation is supposed
to be a bad thing, it--

11:52.334 --> 11:54.067
it's a stealth activity.

11:54.133 --> 11:56.033
you do it on your own,
in secret,

11:56.100 --> 11:57.834
and you lie about it
afterwards.

11:57.901 --> 12:00.067
you feel guilt!

12:00.133 --> 12:02.534
it's one of the last forms
of entirely safe guilt

12:02.601 --> 12:04.534
left available to a man!

12:04.601 --> 12:06.133
i mean, look at this place!

12:06.200 --> 12:07.801
look what the mad fools
have done!

12:07.868 --> 12:10.567
it's an office suite
for masturbation!

12:10.634 --> 12:12.501
there's a <i>receptionist.</i>

12:12.567 --> 12:15.634
there are no receptionists
in masturbation.

12:15.701 --> 12:18.834
do you realize
what i'm expected
to do here?

12:18.901 --> 12:22.267
do you understand
the insanity of it?

12:22.334 --> 12:24.734
i am being asked
to masturbate

12:24.801 --> 12:27.634
in a good cause.

12:27.701 --> 12:28.901
no.

12:28.968 --> 12:31.467
susan, i implore you--

12:31.534 --> 12:34.567
i implore all women everywhere
on behalf of all men--

12:34.634 --> 12:38.200
do not take the wrongness
of masturbation from us.

12:38.267 --> 12:40.367
hear, hear.
hear, hear.

12:42.334 --> 12:43.501
okay.

12:43.567 --> 12:46.434
it'll make very little
difference anyway.

12:46.501 --> 12:49.501
you're not the one
with the problem--i am.

12:51.734 --> 12:53.400
what do you mean?

12:53.467 --> 12:54.667
what's happened?

12:54.734 --> 12:56.634
i had a chat
with dr. graham.

12:56.701 --> 12:58.267
what did he say?

12:58.334 --> 13:01.067
that we'd need a miracle.

13:01.133 --> 13:04.968
and you can't even
manage a cup, apparently.

13:06.167 --> 13:08.000
susan!

13:21.601 --> 13:23.167
then there were two.

13:23.234 --> 13:25.267
you ready to go again yet?

13:29.667 --> 13:31.167
so, did patrick
ever phone?

13:31.234 --> 13:33.868
susan, patrick and i
had our first kiss

13:33.934 --> 13:36.067
to the <i>spiderman</i> theme song.

13:36.133 --> 13:38.334
some things are not
meant to be.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.000
he will phone, you know.
of course he will.

13:41.067 --> 13:43.634
and i'll get the speech
about how wonderful i am.

13:43.701 --> 13:45.400
basic rule, isn't it--

13:45.467 --> 13:47.334
the more wonderful you are
at the start of the speech,

13:47.400 --> 13:48.834
the more dumped
you are at the end.

13:48.901 --> 13:51.734
patrick's not the only man
in the world, you know.

13:51.801 --> 13:53.634
my mistake.

13:53.701 --> 13:56.334
so, could it be you, jane?

13:56.400 --> 14:00.367
well, thinking about it,
actually...

14:00.434 --> 14:02.033
it really could be.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.567
really. who?

14:03.634 --> 14:05.501
i'm guessing
it's not james.

14:05.567 --> 14:09.067
well, james is celibate
and in germany,

14:09.133 --> 14:11.534
so i've ruled him out.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.167
then who?

14:15.234 --> 14:17.767
a couple of weeks ago
i went a bit mad.

14:17.834 --> 14:21.901
well, sort of...
desperate, really.

14:21.968 --> 14:23.801
how desperate?

14:27.834 --> 14:30.000
( doorbell )

14:35.033 --> 14:35.968
Jeff?!

14:36.033 --> 14:38.234
i've always felt
that Jeff and i

14:38.300 --> 14:40.767
have a deep spiritual
connection

14:40.834 --> 14:42.901
that binds us together

14:42.968 --> 14:45.834
in strange
and unknowable ways.

14:45.901 --> 14:48.534
i'd like to speak
to Jeff, please.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.868
i <i>am</i> Jeff.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.567
okay.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.601
( doorbell rings )

15:02.667 --> 15:04.434
oh!

15:06.100 --> 15:08.000
that's handy.

15:14.734 --> 15:17.934
it's good that you and i are
finally having a little chat.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.767
yes, great.

15:22.667 --> 15:25.334
i'm sure we've got
a lot in common.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.434
me, too.

15:27.501 --> 15:29.734
 <i>attack of the 50-foot woman.</i>

15:29.801 --> 15:31.300
yeah.

15:31.367 --> 15:34.167
i also enjoy
feminist cinema.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.133
oh.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.868
good.

15:41.434 --> 15:44.300
can i get you anything?
i'm fine, actually.

15:44.367 --> 15:46.000
anything at all.
what have you got?

15:48.100 --> 15:50.133
four biscuits
and an apple.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.834
oh.

15:51.901 --> 15:53.334
i've owned the apple
for a while.

15:53.400 --> 15:57.234
i think it's probably
still broadly feasible.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.300
but i wouldn't
want to talk it up.

15:59.367 --> 16:00.901
i'm fine, really.

16:00.968 --> 16:03.100
it's very easy
to miss the apple window,
isn't it?

16:03.167 --> 16:05.501
i get very tense
around apples.

16:05.567 --> 16:07.234
you do?

16:07.300 --> 16:10.501
well, i get very tense
generally.

16:10.567 --> 16:12.300
i think i've fallen
into the trap

16:12.367 --> 16:14.100
of blaming fruit.

16:17.934 --> 16:20.634
i think you've got
a very beautiful soul.

16:21.801 --> 16:23.067
yeah?

16:23.133 --> 16:26.167
i'm very aware
of people's inner beauty.

16:26.234 --> 16:29.734
it's one of the most
fascinating things about me.

16:31.701 --> 16:33.133
inner beauty.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.000
inner beauty's
very important, Jeffrey.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.033
so sometimes, ugly people

16:37.100 --> 16:39.100
could be really beautiful
on the inside?

16:39.167 --> 16:41.501
no, that never happens.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.601
you could have
a look at the apple.

16:45.667 --> 16:47.701
i've ordered pizza.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.300
pizza?

16:49.367 --> 16:50.734
before i came.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.467
i thought it'd be nice
to come here and have lunch.

16:52.534 --> 16:55.434
"lunch with Jeffrey,"
i thought. so i ordered pizza.

16:55.501 --> 16:56.834
brilliant!
you don't mind?

16:56.901 --> 16:58.501
no, of course not!

16:58.567 --> 17:00.167
people hardly ever
come here for lunch.

17:00.234 --> 17:02.734
well, i have!
excellent! i'm really pleased!

17:02.801 --> 17:04.367
i'm pleased you're pleased!
i love pizza!

17:04.434 --> 17:07.166
oh--would you
have liked one, too?

17:12.634 --> 17:13.601
no.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.400
no, not at all.

17:15.467 --> 17:19.634
i'll probably go
and check out that apple,
actually.

17:19.701 --> 17:21.434
see if it's peaked.

17:21.501 --> 17:23.099
i love ordering pizza.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.634
because you get to meet someone
and have a meal,

17:25.701 --> 17:27.834
so it's a bit like a date.

17:27.901 --> 17:31.367
except you have to pay for it
and eat it on your own.

17:32.968 --> 17:36.634
i think ordering pizza's
really good for lonely people...

17:36.701 --> 17:38.100
who can't cook.

17:38.167 --> 17:40.367
well, i can't cook.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.868
i can't cook, either.

17:46.801 --> 17:48.200
so how's julia?

17:48.267 --> 17:49.834
julia.

17:49.901 --> 17:52.200
i was really surprised
when you got it together
with julia.

17:52.267 --> 17:54.701
i'd always pegged you for--
well, you know.

17:54.767 --> 17:56.567
gay?

17:56.634 --> 17:58.667
dying alone.

18:04.634 --> 18:08.567
uh, julia's gone off
for a bit, actually.
where?

18:08.634 --> 18:12.400
well, this guy
turned up--joe--
sort of an ex.

18:12.467 --> 18:15.767
so she wanted to go
and explore her feelings
about him--

18:15.834 --> 18:17.000
in bolton.

18:17.067 --> 18:19.534
it's been a while now,

18:19.601 --> 18:22.467
i think she's got
quite a few feelings
to work through.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.267
probably about twenty.

18:24.334 --> 18:29.300
well, my james is exploring
his feelings, too. in germany.

18:29.367 --> 18:32.834
i has this really weird dream
about julia just last night.

18:32.901 --> 18:35.067
dreams are very important,
Jeffrey.

18:35.133 --> 18:39.300
we were roaming
the african plains
together,

18:39.367 --> 18:41.033
wild and free...

18:41.100 --> 18:42.400
she was a lioness,

18:42.467 --> 18:45.934
leaping from tree to tree
and biting gazelles.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.767
and joe was a lion
from a rival pride,

18:48.834 --> 18:50.901
and he was trying
to steal her away from me.

18:50.968 --> 18:53.634
and i was an otter.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.300
which made things
quite difficult

18:58.367 --> 19:00.334
in the combat zone.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.234
anyway, joe and julia
ran off together,

19:03.300 --> 19:04.734
and i tried
to chase after them,

19:04.801 --> 19:06.133
but it was really hard

19:06.200 --> 19:08.033
'cause there were no rivers
running that way.

19:08.100 --> 19:11.901
the african plains
are really under-rivered,
pursuit-wise.

19:11.968 --> 19:14.334
and then, just as i was
about to catch up with them

19:14.400 --> 19:16.267
by this unexpected marina,

19:16.334 --> 19:18.868
there was this terrible roar!

19:18.934 --> 19:20.734
my mother sprang
from the undergrowth,

19:20.801 --> 19:22.234
scooped me up in her jaws,

19:22.300 --> 19:23.834
and carried me
back to the pride.

19:23.901 --> 19:26.367
so your mother
was a lion, too?
no.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.567
well, never mind
being an otter--

19:29.634 --> 19:31.801
you try being
in love with a man

19:31.868 --> 19:33.901
who won't have sex with you
because of <i>god.</i>

19:33.968 --> 19:36.701
it's not easy loving a man
who's in love with god.

19:36.767 --> 19:41.067
it's not acceptable to dress up
in a long beard and robe

19:41.133 --> 19:45.400
and shout,
"i am the lord your god,
take me now!"

19:45.467 --> 19:48.033
i've never seen him
look so cross.

19:50.267 --> 19:53.334
which was odd,
because...

19:53.400 --> 19:55.868
it really worked for <i>me.</i>

19:57.367 --> 20:00.701
i think i'll go and look
for that apple.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.667
i'll help.
i'm good at apples.

20:06.701 --> 20:09.667
it's all rubbish,
isn't it?
rubbish?

20:09.734 --> 20:12.667
they're not exploring their
feelings, they're leaving.

20:12.734 --> 20:14.567
yeah.

20:14.634 --> 20:16.267
yeah, i know.

20:16.334 --> 20:20.400
we don't deserve this.

20:20.467 --> 20:23.901
we really, really
don't deserve this, Jeffrey.

20:23.968 --> 20:26.567
( cell phone rings )

20:26.634 --> 20:29.434
that's my mobile.

20:29.501 --> 20:31.567
hang on.

20:39.467 --> 20:41.601
i am the lord your god.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.400
( hisses )
meow!

20:43.467 --> 20:46.701
sorry, jane,
i've got to go.
where?!

20:46.767 --> 20:48.067
that was steve.

20:48.133 --> 20:49.334
he wants me to
go straight to his house,

20:49.400 --> 20:50.901
collect all his pornography,

20:50.968 --> 20:52.834
his favorite pillow,
and some snacks,

20:52.901 --> 20:54.567
and meet him
at this location.

20:54.634 --> 20:56.734
why?

20:56.801 --> 20:59.067
i didn't think to ask.

21:00.601 --> 21:02.501
i'll see you later.

21:06.033 --> 21:07.701
ohh!

21:09.434 --> 21:11.667
( doorbell )

21:17.734 --> 21:20.067
pizza. for one.

21:23.067 --> 21:25.100
let there be light.

21:28.634 --> 21:30.334
the pizza man?

21:30.400 --> 21:32.300
on Jeff's floor?

21:32.367 --> 21:34.267
i <i>know.</i>

21:34.334 --> 21:37.133
but i've always believed
you can't get pregnant

21:37.200 --> 21:39.634
if you don't really
know the person.

21:39.701 --> 21:41.734
that's complete crap,
isn't it?

21:41.801 --> 21:45.267
yeah, it's pretty much crap,
actually, jane.

21:45.334 --> 21:47.067
ohh, it can't be me!

21:47.133 --> 21:50.100
i haven't done anything
to offend god recently.

21:50.167 --> 21:53.501
what about you?
who's your guy?

21:53.567 --> 21:55.234
peter.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.601
remember the one
i was with

21:56.667 --> 21:58.934
when patrick came to save me
from the spider attack?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.934
oh, no. really?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.968
a complete and total wanker.

22:04.033 --> 22:06.367
trust me to get
his one night off.

22:06.434 --> 22:08.334
oh, sally.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.968
please don't let it be me.
patrick would hate me.

22:12.033 --> 22:14.234
he probably hates me already,
but he'd hate me double.

22:14.300 --> 22:18.267
so, have we got a fix on
the nearest open chemist?

22:18.334 --> 22:19.868
two streets away.

22:19.934 --> 22:21.601
( beeping )
maybe we should--

22:21.667 --> 22:23.167
text message?

22:23.234 --> 22:25.634
yeah.
who from?

22:25.701 --> 22:28.400
who do you think?

22:48.667 --> 22:49.968
sally.

22:50.033 --> 22:51.701
patrick.

22:57.067 --> 22:58.501
private function?

22:58.567 --> 23:00.367
yeah, there's
something later.

23:00.434 --> 23:02.534
oh. so it's not us, then?

23:02.601 --> 23:05.367
no, no.
definitely not us.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.968
sally...

23:10.033 --> 23:14.734
you are the most wonderful woman

23:14.801 --> 23:18.534
in the history of
the entire universe.

23:18.601 --> 23:20.300
you're incredible.

23:20.367 --> 23:23.100
you've got the looks
of a miss world

23:23.167 --> 23:25.534
with the brains to match.

23:27.367 --> 23:30.767
you're more than a woman,
you're like...a man.

23:30.834 --> 23:31.934
seriously,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.334
you could be a bloke
anytime you wanted.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.367
obviously a bloke with
some pretty serious defects,

23:36.434 --> 23:37.834
but who cares about that,

23:37.901 --> 23:40.601
i've seen you down drinks
with the best of 'em.

23:40.667 --> 23:43.868
i wish i'd had
a mother like you.

23:43.934 --> 23:45.801
or a grandmother

23:45.868 --> 23:48.501
or any kind of...
ancestor.

23:48.567 --> 23:50.400
and since you said
what you said,

23:50.467 --> 23:52.234
i've had a lot of time
to think,

23:52.300 --> 23:55.601
but obviously that
isn't always possible.

23:55.667 --> 24:00.234
nonetheless, i have
been able to consider your...

24:00.300 --> 24:03.868
application.

24:03.934 --> 24:06.834
and, and this is the point,
this is the important point--

24:06.901 --> 24:09.934
sally, you need someone
good enough for you.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.434
you don't want some
mutton-headed city boy

24:13.501 --> 24:15.167
who spends all his time
thinking about his cars

24:15.234 --> 24:16.567
and his golf clubs.

24:16.634 --> 24:18.601
you want someone
who can love you

24:18.667 --> 24:20.701
the way you deserve
to be loved,

24:20.767 --> 24:22.400
the way <i>i</i> want you
to be loved.

24:22.467 --> 24:28.467
sally, you need someone
who will love you forever--

24:28.534 --> 24:30.334
properly.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.434
you're my friend, sally,

24:32.501 --> 24:35.501
and i want to see you
with the best.

24:35.567 --> 24:38.501
you need mr. amazing,

24:38.567 --> 24:42.234
mr. incredibly, superbly...

24:42.300 --> 24:44.968
fantastickness.

24:46.968 --> 24:49.000
and in your heart,

24:49.067 --> 24:51.634
i'm sure you know i'm right.

24:55.167 --> 24:59.133
i don't want mr. superbly,
incredibly fantastickness,

24:59.200 --> 25:02.067
you stupid, stupid ass.

25:03.534 --> 25:05.601
i want you.

25:05.667 --> 25:08.067
oh, for god's sake,
sally.

25:09.267 --> 25:11.367
what?

25:11.434 --> 25:12.667
what?!

25:12.734 --> 25:16.667
i was <i>talking</i> about me!

25:21.834 --> 25:23.067
so--

25:23.133 --> 25:26.334
 <i>you're</i> mr. superbly,
incredibly whatever?!

25:26.400 --> 25:28.801
well, yes!

25:32.067 --> 25:33.801
you...

25:33.868 --> 25:35.501
love me?

25:38.100 --> 25:40.167
remember this?

25:40.234 --> 25:42.167
( sound system plays )

25:42.234 --> 25:44.267
* spiderman, spiderman *

25:44.334 --> 25:46.467
* does wherever a spider can *

25:46.534 --> 25:48.801
* spins a web, any size *

25:48.868 --> 25:51.133
* catches thieves
just like flies *

25:51.200 --> 25:53.934
* look out,
here comes spiderman *

25:55.667 --> 25:57.968
oh, my god!

25:58.033 --> 26:00.334
i thought it might
help set the mood.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.534
you said the private function
wasn't us!

26:03.601 --> 26:05.667
a clever lie.

26:08.133 --> 26:09.868
i'd just like it
to be recorded

26:09.934 --> 26:11.868
i was against the costume part.

26:11.934 --> 26:13.434
i wasn't!

26:14.767 --> 26:16.734
i'm also against
the dancing.

26:16.801 --> 26:18.501
i invented this dance!

26:20.067 --> 26:22.234
he wrote it down.
i did!

26:22.300 --> 26:24.701
he's planning to present you
with the early sketches.

26:26.701 --> 26:28.968
come on, steve,
you know you want to!

26:29.033 --> 26:31.334
this is a romantic moment,
Jeff,

26:31.400 --> 26:33.767
your sudden death
might kill the mood.

26:33.834 --> 26:36.968
nothing in the world
could kill the mood.

26:38.801 --> 26:40.567
i'm not pregnant!

26:42.033 --> 26:43.467
look! look at this!

26:43.534 --> 26:46.033
i'm absolutely
100% not pregnant!

26:46.100 --> 26:49.467
i have shagged and shagged
and shagged,

26:49.534 --> 26:51.801
and all the little
bastards missed!

26:51.868 --> 26:54.868
it's a miracle!

26:54.934 --> 26:57.033
i'm not pregnant!

26:58.767 --> 27:00.267
hi, jane.

27:00.334 --> 27:01.834
james.

27:01.901 --> 27:04.400
you're back from germany.

27:05.801 --> 27:08.167
and i'm not pregnant.

27:08.234 --> 27:10.934
that's what i call chemistry.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.934
well, you've clearly
been...busy.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.801
oh, my god.

27:17.868 --> 27:19.300
listen, jane--
shh!

27:21.267 --> 27:22.901
sally--

27:24.033 --> 27:26.434
sally, what's wrong?

27:26.501 --> 27:28.567
sally, no--don't.

27:29.601 --> 27:31.634
i'm pregnant.

27:31.701 --> 27:33.901
( chuckling )
no, you're not.

27:33.968 --> 27:36.067
yes, i am.

27:36.133 --> 27:38.734
no, you're not. 

27:41.634 --> 27:43.701
i am sally harper.

27:43.767 --> 27:45.534
there is nothing in this world

27:45.601 --> 27:48.434
so good that
i can't screw it up.

27:48.501 --> 27:51.100
so let me assure you, patrick...

27:51.167 --> 27:53.267
darling...

27:53.334 --> 27:55.267
yes, i am.

27:58.467 --> 28:00.767
susan: no, you're not.

28:02.801 --> 28:05.133
it's me.

28:09.501 --> 28:10.834
wha--

28:12.300 --> 28:14.367
h-h-how?

28:14.434 --> 28:16.033
w-who?

28:16.100 --> 28:18.734
wh-what?

28:20.200 --> 28:21.968
hippo!

28:26.033 --> 28:27.934
time's up, steve.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.300
i think it's
someone else's turn
to be a child.

28:39.534 --> 28:42.534
* if you can't
make your mind up *

28:42.601 --> 28:44.834
* we'll never *

28:44.901 --> 28:47.067
* get started *

28:48.634 --> 28:51.467
* and i don't
want to wind up *

28:51.534 --> 28:53.734
* being parted *

28:53.801 --> 28:56.200
* brokenhearted *

28:57.501 --> 29:00.701
* so if you really love me *

29:00.767 --> 29:02.501
* say yes *

29:02.567 --> 29:05.300
* and please don't tell me *

29:05.367 --> 29:08.133
* perhaps, perhaps, perhaps *
