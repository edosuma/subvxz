Police station four.

00:47.216 --> 00:51.936
I'm sorry, madam, you will have to
slow down, I can't understand you.

00:51.936 --> 00:54.136
Am I hearing you correctly? A what?

00:54.736 --> 00:56.196
Detective?

00:59.136 --> 01:00.756
Detective, you've got to...

01:00.756 --> 01:01.836
PHONE RINGS

01:01.836 --> 01:05.716
Police station four... Yes, madam,
we are aware of the situation.

01:05.716 --> 01:07.736
What situation?

01:07.736 --> 01:10.116
..George, Henry,
what on earth has happened?

01:10.116 --> 01:13.056
We were walking down
Sumat Street when we heard screams.

01:13.056 --> 01:15.256
Coming from the direction of
the circus.

01:15.256 --> 01:19.276
People were running, screaming...
A tiger got out of its cage, sir.

01:19.276 --> 01:21.656
A huge Bengal brute.
Higgins tackled it.

01:21.656 --> 01:23.436
It was going after an old man.

01:23.436 --> 01:25.836
I hit it with my truncheon,
it barely noticed.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.616
That's when a circus hand shot it.
My goodness!

01:28.616 --> 01:31.276
Was anyone seriously hurt?
The tiger's tamer, sir.

01:31.276 --> 01:33.156
A Miss Kitty Walker. She was killed.

01:33.156 --> 01:37.316
I ordered her remains to the morgue,
and the tiger. Good thinking.

01:37.316 --> 01:38.796
Come with me.

01:38.796 --> 01:41.076
Let's pay a visit to this circus.

01:42.196 --> 01:44.036
I don't understand.

01:45.636 --> 01:48.816
Where are they? 
It was right here.

01:48.816 --> 01:50.176
Tents and all.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.016
They've obviously packed up
and left in a hurry.

01:54.016 --> 01:57.656
But if it was just a terrible
accident, why flee the scene?

01:57.656 --> 02:01.776
Why, indeed?
Find them, George, and arrest them.

02:01.776 --> 02:03.236
All of them.

02:17.556 --> 02:19.056
Any messages?

02:38.216 --> 02:39.436
Murdoch!

02:40.496 --> 02:46.016
I had no choice, sir. None of them
have fixed addresses and they've
all demonstrated a tendency to flee.

02:46.016 --> 02:49.636
So you've arrested them all
because a lion tamer got careless?

02:49.636 --> 02:51.316
I haven't charged anyone yet.

02:51.316 --> 02:54.716
But we need them in custody,
so I can determine what happened.

02:54.716 --> 02:58.536
Can't they be kept in the cells?
It hardly seems fair
to incarcerate them.

02:58.536 --> 03:01.176
Most of them are upstairs
in the lunch room.

03:01.176 --> 03:04.256
Just keep them away
from me, Murdoch.

03:04.256 --> 03:06.576
Who's in charge of this rabble
anyway?

03:06.576 --> 03:09.816
It was horrible.
I went backstage to fetch Kitty,

03:09.816 --> 03:11.596
her act was up next,

03:11.596 --> 03:14.116
and that's how I found her.

03:14.116 --> 03:16.296
Half eaten.

03:17.836 --> 03:21.836
What was she doing
inside the tiger's cage?

03:21.836 --> 03:24.376
She used to sit with
Saber before each show.

03:24.376 --> 03:26.356
It was a ritual the two of them had.

03:26.356 --> 03:28.436
She said it calmed him.

03:28.436 --> 03:31.096
But this time,
the animal attacked her.

03:31.096 --> 03:32.836
I did what I could.

03:32.836 --> 03:36.116
I opened the cage door and tried
to force Saber back with a broom.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.736
That's when the tiger escaped?

03:38.736 --> 03:40.516
You know the rest.

03:41.656 --> 03:46.956
What I know is that
you tried to flee town while
one of your performers lay dead.

03:46.956 --> 03:49.216
And I feel awful about that.

03:49.216 --> 03:53.676
But I've learned that locals
can react rather unfairly
when things go amiss.

03:53.676 --> 03:59.596
This type of occurrence happens often
in Barnett's Royal Travelling Circus?

03:59.596 --> 04:01.696
Not at all!

04:01.696 --> 04:05.796
There was an unfortunate incident
with a dancing bear, and we had

04:05.796 --> 04:10.256
some bad luck with a fire breather,
but everyone got out in time.

04:10.256 --> 04:16.336
It's not as though these
things are the end of the world.
No. But it was for Miss Walker.

04:22.164 --> 04:25.384
It had begun to devour parts of
her neck and abdomen as well.

04:25.384 --> 04:27.444
Perhaps she had mistreated it?

04:27.444 --> 04:32.284
Someone did. I checked the tiger's
digestive tract and except
for the stomach, which was...

04:32.284 --> 04:35.164
rather full of course,
it was entirely empty.

04:35.164 --> 04:38.784
The tiger had been starved?
For several days at least.

04:38.784 --> 04:42.104
Which makes me wonder whether
this was a random animal attack.

04:42.104 --> 04:43.944
Or if it was engineered?

04:50.012 --> 04:52.812
George?

04:52.812 --> 04:54.952
Where is the tiger's cage?

04:54.952 --> 04:57.332
We brought it in to
the police stables.

04:57.332 --> 05:02.072
Good thinking.
Find out who was responsible for
feeding the tiger and meet me there.

05:02.072 --> 05:03.892
Yes, sir.

05:03.892 --> 05:07.212
Who fed the tiger?

05:08.772 --> 05:10.412
Saber ate three times a day.

05:10.412 --> 05:11.992
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

05:11.992 --> 05:13.732
And you kept to this schedule?

05:13.732 --> 05:16.072
Of course. It's my job. Why?

05:16.072 --> 05:19.572
Mr Selby,
the tiger had been starved.

05:19.572 --> 05:21.812
For several days or more.

05:21.812 --> 05:24.692
That's impossible.
He ate everything I gave him.

05:26.252 --> 05:28.612
Can you show me
how the tiger was fed?

05:28.612 --> 05:31.152
I open this door at the bottom...

05:33.332 --> 05:36.152
..and slide in a plate of meat -

05:36.152 --> 05:38.452
usually chicken, beef, bones -

05:38.452 --> 05:40.012
like so.

05:40.012 --> 05:42.132
Did you watch the tiger eat his food?

05:42.132 --> 05:46.432
Well, no, I had other animals
to feed. But the plate was always
empty when I came back.

05:46.432 --> 05:51.212
So someone could have taken the food
away? I don't see how, Detective.

05:51.212 --> 05:57.092
If a hand came between Saber and his
food, guaranteed that hand would
be a goner. How remarkable, sir.

05:57.092 --> 06:00.712
A cat so large it needs
a heavy-link chain as a leash.

06:00.712 --> 06:04.152
You don't want the tiger off
its leash when you open that door.

06:04.152 --> 06:06.272
And yet Saber ran off.

06:06.272 --> 06:07.492
Sir, look.

06:08.512 --> 06:11.092
If the chain was
cinched with this shackle...

06:14.252 --> 06:18.432
..there'd be no way...
For the tiger to reach its food.
You're right, George.

06:18.432 --> 06:21.812
That choker's supposed to reach
all the way to the end.

06:21.812 --> 06:26.532
So someone could have pulled the
chain through the bars, like so,

06:26.532 --> 06:29.712
and installed this shackle
every day before feeding time,

06:29.712 --> 06:34.792
then returned to remove the shackle
before Miss Walker came to collect
Saber for the performances.

06:34.792 --> 06:38.252
Even so, sir, how would the
tiger have got free of the choker?

06:38.252 --> 06:40.492
Miss Walker must have done that.

06:40.492 --> 06:43.992
She would have been just as surprised
to find it shortened as we are.

06:43.992 --> 06:45.612
Who had access to this cage?

06:45.612 --> 06:48.652
Anyone who wanted it, I suppose.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.452
Gentlemen, down the hatch.

06:54.452 --> 06:56.332
He's not going to swallow that!

06:58.392 --> 07:00.132
Starved!

07:00.132 --> 07:03.672
Yes, the cinching of the chain made
it impossible for the animal to eat.

07:03.672 --> 07:08.052
So maybe someone didn't like
the tiger, it's not necessarily
a deliberate act of murder.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.652
But we can't ignore that possibility.

07:09.652 --> 07:12.692
Bloody hell, Murdoch. Here it comes!

07:12.692 --> 07:14.372
Excuse me.

07:16.392 --> 07:19.992
Enough! This is a police
station, not a bloody circus.

07:19.992 --> 07:26.392
Mitchell, who's minding the desk
while you're stood there catching
flies? Back to work, the lot of you!

07:26.392 --> 07:29.772
You've got 24 hours.
That may not be enough.

07:29.772 --> 07:34.912
Habeas Corpus. I don't want
these people around longer than
what's permitted by law. Yes, sir.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.532
George...

07:37.812 --> 07:42.232
..I'd like you and Higgins
to interview... Someone get this
bloody monkey out of my office!

07:42.232 --> 07:47.052
Interview all of these circus folk.
See if you can get a sense of who
may have had issues with Miss Walker.

07:51.212 --> 07:54.552
What do you mean...
Kitty may have been murdered?

07:54.552 --> 07:56.432
Let's not play games, Mr Barnett.

07:56.432 --> 08:00.672
There was a reason you packed up
the circus and left town.
But I already told you...

08:00.672 --> 08:02.692
How was your relationship
with Miss Walker?

08:02.692 --> 08:06.232
Very friendly. She was
a lovely girl. Always smiling.

08:06.232 --> 08:08.792
Yet you left her body behind.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.832
I had no choice.

08:12.012 --> 08:14.112
Didn't you think
to make arrangements?

08:14.112 --> 08:16.472
Contact her family?

08:16.472 --> 08:18.692
It takes a very cold man to do that.

08:18.692 --> 08:21.752
So cold, it makes me suspect you had
something to do with her death.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.712
Now, wait just a minute here!

08:23.712 --> 08:26.432
If you think I'd harm her,
you've got this all wrong.

08:26.432 --> 08:29.992
For a normal,
Kitty was a star attraction.

08:29.992 --> 08:31.672
For a normal?

08:31.672 --> 08:34.732
Like you and me.
As opposed to a freak.

08:34.732 --> 08:37.892
Freaks bring in more money, usually.

08:38.932 --> 08:40.852
Who, then, may have wanted her dead?

08:42.751 --> 08:48.172
Mr Barnett, none of you are leaving
here until I get some answers.

08:49.872 --> 08:54.252
Ask Ivy. She was Kitty's
best friend. If anyone knows
anything, it would be her.

08:59.065 --> 09:01.745
You are staring, Detective.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.745
Miss... Ivy.

09:07.745 --> 09:09.825
Just Ivy.

09:09.825 --> 09:12.545
Very well, Miss Ivy...

09:12.545 --> 09:14.225
You can stare, if you want.

09:14.225 --> 09:17.325
I don't mind.
It's how I make my living.

09:17.325 --> 09:21.405
It grows all over my body.
Had it since I was born.

09:21.405 --> 09:24.045
Payment for my mama's sins.

09:24.045 --> 09:30.885
How do you mean? Let's just
say she ate supper before
she said grace.

09:30.885 --> 09:33.785
You were conceived out of wedlock?

09:33.785 --> 09:36.785
In a patch of poison ivy
in Ivy Point, Georgia.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.705
Mama says the poison must have
seeped into her womb.

09:39.705 --> 09:45.625
I see, Miss Ivy. I'm less interested
in your skin condition

09:45.625 --> 09:47.885
than I am with your friendship
with Miss Walker.

09:47.885 --> 09:50.185
I'm told the two of you
were close friends.

09:50.185 --> 09:52.525
It's a circus, Detective Murdoch.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.885
The friendships are
fleeting and eternal.

09:54.885 --> 09:58.085
But yes, I was closest with Kitty.

09:58.085 --> 10:02.445
Perhaps you can tell me why
someone would want to kill her.
Kill her?

10:02.445 --> 10:05.785
Nobody wanted to kill Kitty.
Saber just went wild.

10:05.785 --> 10:08.125
We have reason to believe otherwise.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.545
Miss Ivy?

10:14.545 --> 10:19.265
I'm not saying he did it, but she
had frequent words with her fiance.

10:19.265 --> 10:21.025
I was concerned for her.

10:21.025 --> 10:25.505
And his name? Count Leoline.

10:25.505 --> 10:27.225
Of course we fought.

10:27.225 --> 10:29.625
We fought like we loved, Detective.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.985
With passion. With intensity.

10:31.985 --> 10:33.025
With ardour.

10:33.025 --> 10:35.985
Your ardour is your business.

10:35.985 --> 10:38.445
What concerns me,
Mr Leoline, is your anger.

10:38.445 --> 10:41.665
Please address me by my title.

10:41.665 --> 10:44.545
I am a Count. Oh.

10:44.545 --> 10:46.925
Well, Count,

10:46.925 --> 10:52.005
your tempestuous
relationship leads me to suspect
you plotted to kill your fiance.

10:52.005 --> 10:53.845
On my word, sir,

10:53.845 --> 10:58.125
I may look like a beast,
but I am a gentleman.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.805
I've lost my love
to a terrible tragedy.

11:00.805 --> 11:02.785
Can you not see that I am grieving?

11:02.785 --> 11:07.685
That doesn't change the fact
that someone starved that tiger with
the intention of killing Miss Walker.

11:07.685 --> 11:10.205
I don't believe it.
Everyone loved Kitty.

11:10.205 --> 11:12.845
My God,

11:12.845 --> 11:15.985
if she was murdered,
it was an attack on me.

11:17.045 --> 11:23.205
You? People are jealous of me. Of
my noble birth. My superior bearing.

11:23.205 --> 11:26.685
Especially Jake the Magician.

11:28.385 --> 11:31.825
Why is that? Before I won her heart,

11:31.825 --> 11:34.165
Jake and Kitty were lovers.

11:34.165 --> 11:36.565
We fought over her
affections, literally.

11:38.145 --> 11:40.225
I defeated him easily, of course.

11:40.225 --> 11:42.605
He always hated me for that.

11:46.385 --> 11:51.405
Higgins and I once competed
in a three-legged race,
so I think we have a good idea ...

11:51.405 --> 11:53.985
Sir, we've almost
finished our interviews.

11:53.985 --> 11:55.665
Yes, I can see that.

11:58.325 --> 12:01.285
Any hint of a motive
for killing Miss Walker?

12:01.285 --> 12:03.085
No, sir. Not really.

12:03.085 --> 12:07.085
Any luck with you? Each seems to
be pointing the finger at the other.

12:07.085 --> 12:10.265
Speaking of which, I'll need to
talk to Jake the Magician.

12:10.265 --> 12:12.965
He's in the booking
area with Sergeant Burke.

12:14.585 --> 12:17.045
Smile upon these... Seems to be
quite the life, doesn't it, sir?

12:17.045 --> 12:21.105
Behold your card! Did you ever dream
about joining the circus as a boy?

12:21.105 --> 12:23.325
No, I didn't, George. I did.

12:23.325 --> 12:27.245
It's because
I'm an adventure-seeker, which is
why I became a cop, apparently.

12:27.245 --> 12:31.705
At least, that's what
Lady Minerva said. Lady Minerva?

12:31.705 --> 12:33.425
She's the Gypsy fortune-teller.

12:33.425 --> 12:37.185
I highly doubt she's
a true fortune-teller, George.

12:37.185 --> 12:40.565
She knew I was a foundling.
She wasn't guessing.
It was on the cards.

12:40.565 --> 12:44.025
Did she have anything
relevant to say about the case?

12:44.025 --> 12:46.405
She believes the tiger was innocent.

12:48.005 --> 12:50.625
All animals are innocent, George.

12:50.625 --> 12:52.225
Humans excepted...

12:52.225 --> 12:54.685
PHONE RINGS

12:54.685 --> 12:57.305
Hello?

12:57.305 --> 12:59.465
It was the last thing I expected.
But as I was examining

12:59.465 --> 13:03.725
the bite wound on Miss Walker's
neck, I found remnants of
an incision.

13:03.725 --> 13:07.485
An incision? On a very shallow
angle right through to the spine.

13:07.485 --> 13:08.945
Have a look.

13:10.965 --> 13:15.405
A small section of the fourth
vertebra has been chipped off.

13:15.405 --> 13:19.065
Perhaps by the tiger's claws,
or teeth?

13:19.065 --> 13:22.305
No. The cut was linear and thin.
I'm certain it was made by a knife.

13:22.305 --> 13:24.505
You were right, William.

13:24.505 --> 13:26.285
Kitty Walker was murdered.

13:26.285 --> 13:31.665
And by someone who was well aware
that in the moments following,
Miss Walker would be...devoured.

13:35.545 --> 13:37.805
She was stabbed? In the throat?
Yes, sir.

13:37.805 --> 13:42.205
The tiger's bites on Kitty Walker's
neck would have erased any
sign of the original wound.

13:42.205 --> 13:43.845
That's why the tiger attacked.

13:43.845 --> 13:48.445
Miss Walker was dead and bleeding
and the tiger was starving.
Yes, sir. In you get, George.

13:48.445 --> 13:52.825
It's a clever way to kill someone.
To have the knife wound
obscured by the tiger bite.

13:52.825 --> 13:57.165
Yes, and if not for
Dr Ogden's persistence,
it would have been the perfect crime.

13:57.165 --> 14:01.525
Miss Walker would have
likely been sitting down
here with the tiger, George.

14:03.645 --> 14:08.445
Given the location of the wound,
the killer struck from behind.
Like this.

14:08.445 --> 14:10.305
This changes everything, Murdoch.

14:10.305 --> 14:12.205
You have a place and a time now.

14:12.205 --> 14:17.745
Yes, which means the killer must
have been backstage shortly before
Mr Barnett happened upon the scene.

14:17.745 --> 14:20.845
I want to know where they all
were when she was killed. Yes, sir.

14:20.845 --> 14:23.805
George, please get started on that.
Yes, sir. And you, Murdoch?

14:23.805 --> 14:29.005
I'm going to find out how a Gypsy
fortune-teller came to know the
tiger didn't kill Miss Walker.

14:31.485 --> 14:33.465
I only know what the cards tell me.

14:34.485 --> 14:37.045
Begging your pardon,
but cards don't speak.

14:37.045 --> 14:39.105
They're made in a printing shop.

14:39.105 --> 14:41.525
Do you believe in God, Detective?

14:41.525 --> 14:45.405
Of course. God spoke to Moses
through a burning bush, did he not?

14:45.405 --> 14:46.925
What of it?

14:46.925 --> 14:52.945
If God spoke to Moses through a
burning bush, why shouldn't
He speak through cards?

14:52.945 --> 14:56.485
Are you so arrogant as to
assume you know the ways of God?

14:56.485 --> 15:00.685
No. I just don't think
God speaks through you.

15:00.685 --> 15:03.605
But I believe that you know
something about what happened.

15:06.925 --> 15:08.545
You have a great deal of knowledge.

15:08.545 --> 15:11.345
This is a source of pride to you.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.885
You take comfort in logic...

15:17.585 --> 15:20.025
..except when it conflicts with
your religious beliefs.

15:20.025 --> 15:22.045
I'm familiar with this parlour game.

15:22.045 --> 15:25.785
Speak in flattering
generalities, avoid specifics.

15:25.785 --> 15:28.025
You love a woman.

15:28.025 --> 15:31.485
She's your match in every way.

15:33.245 --> 15:34.885
And...oh, dear...

15:34.885 --> 15:37.165
she doesn't appear
to be in your future.

15:37.165 --> 15:41.145
I'm not here to have my
fortune told, Lady Minerva.

15:41.145 --> 15:43.325
I want to know what happened today.

15:43.325 --> 15:45.845
I only know what the cards tells me.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.505
Then perhaps the cards
can answer a question?

15:48.505 --> 15:50.285
Of course.

15:50.285 --> 15:53.045
Who was responsible for
Kitty Walker's death?

15:58.685 --> 16:00.325
Turn it over.

16:08.185 --> 16:10.045
Kitty Walker was murdered.

16:10.045 --> 16:11.705
So I hear.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.065
Doesn't that bother you, Jake?

16:15.065 --> 16:17.285
Weren't you and Kitty lovers?

16:17.285 --> 16:19.265
Used to be. What of it?

16:19.265 --> 16:20.945
You were jilted.

16:20.945 --> 16:24.145
Defeated in a physical contest
for her affections, were you not?

16:24.145 --> 16:26.105
Did Leo tell you that?

16:26.105 --> 16:31.205
I was drunk, and it wasn't
a contest over her affections.

16:31.205 --> 16:33.645
I told him he treated Kitty badly.

16:33.645 --> 16:37.505
So you weren't the least bit
angry that she chose
Count Leoline over you?

16:37.505 --> 16:39.705
I was wounded, I don't deny it.

16:39.705 --> 16:41.985
Discarded in favour of that
freak of nature.

16:44.005 --> 16:46.105
But that was six months ago.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.005
I learned to accept it.

16:48.005 --> 16:50.245
Where were you when Kitty was killed?

16:50.245 --> 16:52.605
I was with Ivy. What were you doing?

16:53.665 --> 16:56.825
Let's just say we were intertwined.

16:58.565 --> 17:04.045
Gentlemen. Sir, Mr Barnett was
explaining the layout of the circus.

17:04.045 --> 17:07.204
We have a central ring here
in the big tent.

17:07.204 --> 17:11.964
All acts in waiting must be in
the backstage tent a quarter hour
before their performance.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.204
Who was backstage with Miss Walker?

17:14.204 --> 17:18.744
No-one. She was the final
performer of the night. Who was
the last person to see her alive?

17:18.744 --> 17:21.605
We believe that was
Bob Selby, the animal feeder.

17:21.605 --> 17:25.625
I heard Leo arguing with Kitty
and I had Selby poke his head in
to see if she was all right.

17:25.625 --> 17:26.845
But Leo had already left.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.785
And she was still alive?

17:28.785 --> 17:31.185
She was just climbing
into Saber's cage.

17:31.185 --> 17:34.785
How long after that
did you discover her dead?

17:34.785 --> 17:37.585
Maybe five minutes.

17:37.585 --> 17:39.705
Where were you during this period?

17:39.705 --> 17:42.525
I've told your constables twice,
I was sidestage the whole time.

17:42.525 --> 17:44.565
Very well.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.385
Thank you. That will be all,
Mr Barnett.

17:49.025 --> 17:53.085
George, were you able to
determine everyone's
whereabouts during this time?

17:53.085 --> 17:55.965
Not quite, sir.

17:55.965 --> 17:58.765
Oh. What of Count Leoline?
Interesting you should ask, sir.

17:58.765 --> 18:03.165
He claims that he was with
Miss Ivy, but she confirms she
was with Jake the Magician.

18:03.165 --> 18:08.965
George, I'd like you and
Higgins to dig up everything
you can on this alleged Count. Sir.

18:10.605 --> 18:14.205
I never said I was with her,
I said she was my alibi.

18:14.205 --> 18:16.785
And the distinction would be?

18:19.825 --> 18:23.365
Kitty and I had just had a terrible
fight. I'd gone for a walk.

18:23.365 --> 18:29.465
As I passed by Ivy's caravan,
she was standing on the steps
smoking a cigarette.

18:29.465 --> 18:31.245
We shared a look.

18:31.245 --> 18:33.825
She watched me as I went
down the path to the river.

18:33.825 --> 18:36.765
How do you know Ivy watched you?

18:36.765 --> 18:40.405
I could feel her eyes on me.

18:40.405 --> 18:44.825
It's true, I do enjoy an occasional
cigarette, but everyone knows that.

18:44.825 --> 18:48.205
Leo, however, did not pass by,
as he claims.

18:48.205 --> 18:52.465
You're certain? I could hear them
arguing. It was hard to ignore.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.445
By the time they stopped,
I'd gone back inside.

18:55.445 --> 18:58.205
For a romantic interlude with
Jake the Magician?

18:58.205 --> 19:00.645
Did Jake tell you that?

19:03.165 --> 19:05.245
The man has no discretion.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.345
Yes, I was with Jake.

19:09.165 --> 19:12.345
You were Miss Walker's friend.
Was there something in particular

19:12.345 --> 19:14.685
that she and Count Leoline
were fighting about?

19:14.685 --> 19:16.865
Lately? It was her money.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.565
Her money?

19:18.565 --> 19:21.725
Her wealthy uncle
died a few months back.

19:21.725 --> 19:26.465
There was a sizable inheritance
coming to Kitty as soon as the
lawyers finalised the papers.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.485
Leo had grand plans for it.

19:28.485 --> 19:30.045
I see.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.805
Leo never came by that day.

19:31.805 --> 19:33.345
He's lyin'.

19:33.345 --> 19:36.485
She's lying! Why would she lie?
I don't know.

19:36.485 --> 19:38.245
Perhaps she's jealous.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.405
Is everyone jealous of you?

19:40.405 --> 19:43.545
She once tried to seduce me.
Really? When was that?

19:43.545 --> 19:45.445
Six months ago.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.905
I made it clear I wasn't interested.

19:47.905 --> 19:49.945
Maybe SHE killed Kitty.

19:49.945 --> 19:53.905
You're saying that Ivy was so wounded
by your rejection

19:53.905 --> 19:57.805
that she befriended your fiancee
for the next six months,

19:57.805 --> 20:01.645
all in an attempt to kill her
and frame you for the murder?

20:01.645 --> 20:04.005
You may find this hard
to believe, Detective,

20:04.005 --> 20:05.985
but women find me irresistible.

20:05.985 --> 20:09.505
My savage exterior, I suppose.

20:09.505 --> 20:14.245
At my last circus,
a woman even tried to kill herself
because I refused her.

20:17.025 --> 20:18.325
See? She just waved at you.

20:18.325 --> 20:21.305
Higgins,
they're conjoined twins, man.

20:21.305 --> 20:23.705
So? I think Daisy's sweet on me.

20:23.705 --> 20:26.205
And I'm left-handed.

20:26.205 --> 20:29.345
I don't see a future in it,
Higgins. ..Sir!

20:29.345 --> 20:31.625
What have you learned, George?

20:31.625 --> 20:37.785
Sir, Count Leoline is indeed a
Count, but these days, that doesn't
count for much, it would seem.

20:37.785 --> 20:40.765
His family lost their holdings
in the Franco-Prussian war.

20:40.765 --> 20:44.485
As a result, they're left with
title, but no wealth
worth speaking of.

20:44.485 --> 20:49.445
Mr Barnett tells me Leo's mother
placed him in the circus
to make ends meet.

20:51.493 --> 20:52.753
I hope you hang!

20:52.753 --> 20:54.393
You are a shameful man!

20:54.393 --> 20:56.773
How dare you touch me, woman!

20:56.773 --> 21:01.373
So if he had no money and
Miss Kitty had the money, then why
kill her before they're married?

21:01.373 --> 21:05.913
He didn't. Count Leoline and
Kitty Walker were married
two weeks ago in Niagara Falls.

21:05.913 --> 21:07.453
I found that in his caravan.

21:11.073 --> 21:12.993
Yes, we were married.

21:12.993 --> 21:16.553
What of it? Why keep it a secret?

21:16.553 --> 21:19.313
It was what Kitty wanted.

21:19.313 --> 21:25.073
She had told her family about me,
but they didn't know who,
or...what I was.

21:25.073 --> 21:28.113
So the fact that Kitty
was set to inherit... The money?

21:28.113 --> 21:32.753
You think I killed her
for the money?
I'd accept any alternate reason.

21:32.753 --> 21:35.993
That money was for us. We were going
to start our own circus.

21:35.993 --> 21:37.733
Take the best of Barnett's with us.

21:37.733 --> 21:39.633
Normals and freaks alike.

21:39.633 --> 21:42.333
Did she share your vision?

21:42.333 --> 21:45.073
Or is that why you fought?

21:45.073 --> 21:47.513
Is that why you plotted to kill her?

21:47.513 --> 21:51.473
I've endured enough from you!
To stand accused like this
is simply unbearable.

21:51.473 --> 21:54.133
I would have given my life for hers!

21:56.613 --> 21:59.513
Well, Count, you may yet
get that chance.

22:00.493 --> 22:01.553
KNOCK ON DOOR

22:13.413 --> 22:18.413
Sir, I hate to bother you,
but Lady Minerva is making
some startling predictions.

22:18.413 --> 22:22.853
I'm not interested
in the prognostications
of some Gypsy fortune-teller.

22:22.853 --> 22:25.973
Sir, I think you'll want to
hear these prognostications.

22:27.793 --> 22:29.533
I've never seen anything like it.

22:29.533 --> 22:31.933
Such ominous cards.

22:31.933 --> 22:34.013
Yes, I'm sure they're
extremely ominous.

22:34.013 --> 22:36.673
The Devil Card...destroyer of peace.

22:36.673 --> 22:40.913
The Judgement Card...disappointment,
fear, failure.

22:40.913 --> 22:45.873
The Death Card...unexpected
destruction and change.

22:45.873 --> 22:48.533
Is there something
specific you want to tell me?

22:48.533 --> 22:50.453
Someone is going to die tonight.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.613
Someone at this station.

22:58.655 --> 23:03.975
You don't believe her, do you?
I don't believe in tarot cards, but I
do think this woman knows something.

23:03.975 --> 23:07.895
In this instance, she may be aware
of a plot, but doesn't want
to be implicated.

23:07.895 --> 23:09.515
And this is her way of warning us?

23:11.895 --> 23:15.415
Right. Crabtree. Sir. I want all
these people checked for weapons.

23:15.415 --> 23:17.255
Keep them in the cells overnight.

23:17.255 --> 23:19.915
Keep them under surveillance
until we figure this out.

23:19.915 --> 23:23.275
Oh, George,
sequester Leoline in his own cell.

23:23.275 --> 23:26.515
Sir. So, Count Hairy Gob's
your suspect, then?

23:26.515 --> 23:32.195
He had motive and gave a false alibi.
Good. I'll be glad to see the
back of this lot. "Royal" circus.

23:33.315 --> 23:35.615
Sir...

23:35.615 --> 23:37.895
you have a monkey on your desk.

23:37.895 --> 23:39.215
She's called Athena.

23:39.215 --> 23:42.815
She's a cheeky monkey, but she seems
to have taken a shine to me.

23:42.815 --> 23:47.635
Huh. Athena!

24:27.795 --> 24:31.035
Leoline!
LADIES GASP

24:31.035 --> 24:35.215
Sir, we've left the scene
exactly as we found it.

24:38.855 --> 24:41.195
It appears he was stabbed, William.

24:41.195 --> 24:45.775
But he was isolated in a locked
cell all night. It's impossible.

24:47.355 --> 24:51.075
Nevertheless, approximately two
hours ago, the impossible happened.

24:55.915 --> 24:58.175
The guard didn't fall asleep?
Not even once?

24:58.175 --> 25:03.935
He swears on his job he didn't. Even
if he took a privy break, I don't
understand it. The cell was locked.

25:03.935 --> 25:08.535
How could this happen? I don't know,
sir. I'll have the results of
Dr Ogden's post-mortem soon,

25:08.535 --> 25:11.095
but I'm fairly certain
he died of the knife wound.

25:11.095 --> 25:14.955
Where did the killer get the knife?
Where is it now?

25:14.955 --> 25:19.295
We're searching the cells
and all the circus members.
I've relocated them to the stables.

25:19.295 --> 25:24.715
Under guard, of course. I want
the search done properly. Bring
a matron in for the women. Right.

25:24.715 --> 25:28.695
Nobody commits in murder in my
jail cells and gets away with it.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.335
Understand?

25:30.335 --> 25:33.175
Count Leoline was definitely
stabbed with a knife.

25:33.175 --> 25:35.595
Once. Through the
larynx and carotid artery.

25:35.595 --> 25:38.095
Death was instant?
Within seconds, I should think.

25:38.095 --> 25:41.655
With the larynx pierced, he wouldn't
have been able to cry out.

25:41.655 --> 25:45.115
That explains why the constable
on duty never heard a thing.

25:45.115 --> 25:50.455
A fascinating condition, isn't it?
Hypertrichosis, I believe.

25:50.455 --> 25:52.655
Yes, that's right. Imagine

25:52.655 --> 25:56.255
having your life defined by
a random genetic mutation.

25:56.255 --> 26:01.215
It certainly didn't impede his
ability to attract a beautiful
woman like Kitty Walker.

26:01.215 --> 26:03.215
Oh, I can understand that.

26:03.215 --> 26:07.595
He's very handsome. In spite of, or
perhaps because of his condition.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.355
Yes, well... Is there
anything else you can tell me?

26:12.355 --> 26:13.995
Just one more thing.

26:13.995 --> 26:15.955
The knife went in
at an unusual angle.

26:15.955 --> 26:18.515
Very shallow, almost
parallel to the ground.

26:22.115 --> 26:25.095
Sir, we've checked every mattress.

26:25.095 --> 26:27.215
Every nook and cranny. The drains?

26:27.215 --> 26:30.935
Checked with a mirror.
There's no knife to be found.

26:30.935 --> 26:34.575
Then it must be hidden on one of the
prisoners. How did it happen, George?

26:34.575 --> 26:38.255
How did a man locked alone in
a cell get stabbed to death?

26:40.435 --> 26:43.475
Suppose the killer was in
one of the adjoining cells.

26:47.575 --> 26:49.675
It's much too far to reach.

26:49.675 --> 26:54.575
I suppose if Count Leoline was
unsuspecting of his attacker, he
could have been lured to the bars.

26:54.575 --> 26:58.895
In that scenario, the knife
angle could have been correct.

26:58.895 --> 27:01.395
So, that's it then.
I don't think so, George.

27:01.395 --> 27:04.175
You've just been stabbed
in the carotid artery.

27:04.175 --> 27:05.815
You have seconds to live.
What do you do?

27:07.375 --> 27:09.695
Bleed. Panic.

27:09.695 --> 27:13.095
Flail around a bit, I suppose
There's no blood
on the bars, George.

27:13.095 --> 27:16.995
And are you going to take the
time to return to your bunk
and tuck yourself in?

27:16.995 --> 27:18.895
No, I suppose not.

27:18.895 --> 27:22.355
No. He was definitely lying here
when he was killed.

27:22.355 --> 27:25.575
So, someone must have broken in.
How?

27:25.575 --> 27:29.815
It would have taken
far too long. And the constable
on duty never left his post.

27:37.975 --> 27:40.275
What are you thinking, sir?

27:40.275 --> 27:43.595
George, I'm going to need
a length of string.

27:45.295 --> 27:47.655
You're sure somebody threw the
knife? That's right, George.

27:47.655 --> 27:48.995
Lower the string a bit.

27:50.255 --> 27:53.855
But, sir, that means he would
have had to aim the knife
through all these cell bars.

27:53.855 --> 27:55.875
Yes, even lower still.

27:55.875 --> 28:00.035
Sir, the accuracy required to make
that throw is... That's perfect.
Hold the string there.

28:00.035 --> 28:05.975
So, someone could have thrown the
knife from within that cell,
or perhaps the one where you are.

28:05.975 --> 28:08.135
It would explain the angle of entry.
Yes.

28:08.135 --> 28:12.595
But it would be a one-chance throw.
And who among our guests has
the skill to pull that off?

28:12.595 --> 28:14.115
And how would they
retrieve the knife?

28:18.175 --> 28:23.435
Sir, in the first cell, we had Jake
the Magician, Bob Selby, the Giant,
the Juggler and a contortionist.

28:23.435 --> 28:26.755
In the second cell,
Count Leoline, sequestered.

28:26.755 --> 28:31.995
In the third cell, the clown,
the cowboy, Pierre Barnett
and another circus hand.

28:31.995 --> 28:34.515
In the corner cell, we had
Miss Ivy, Lady Minerva, the twins,

28:34.515 --> 28:38.135
the Romanovs,
the midget and the Indian girl.

28:38.135 --> 28:39.915
KNOCK ON DOOR

28:39.915 --> 28:42.295
We've searched every prisoner.

28:42.295 --> 28:44.575
No knife. Right.

28:46.615 --> 28:50.275
Gentlemen, find out if anyone
had a grudge against Count Leoline.

28:50.275 --> 28:53.135
Yes, sir. Sir.

28:53.135 --> 28:55.075
You are aware that
no knife was found?

28:55.075 --> 28:56.835
And yet a knife was used.

28:56.835 --> 28:59.915
Then where is it? And how,
if a person threw the knife,

28:59.915 --> 29:01.615
could they retrieve it
from a locked cell?

29:01.615 --> 29:04.375
I believe a string was tied to
the knife. Bloody hell! String.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.215
Did we even find any string?

29:06.215 --> 29:07.975
No.

29:07.975 --> 29:09.835
So what's next?

29:09.835 --> 29:13.815
Well, in the absence of
a murder weapon, we'll have to rely
strongly on motive.

29:13.815 --> 29:17.875
So the person who killed Kitty
could also have murdered Count Leo?

29:17.875 --> 29:21.715
Possibly. But if Count Leoline was
the chief suspect in Kitty's murder,

29:21.715 --> 29:25.575
perhaps his murder was the result of
revenge on Miss Walker's behalf.

29:25.575 --> 29:27.215
Who wanted revenge?

29:27.215 --> 29:30.495
I have a theory on that.
I was hoping you would.

29:32.895 --> 29:36.375
How are you at throwing knives,
Miss Ivy?

29:36.375 --> 29:39.555
Me? Oh, Detective. Really?

29:39.555 --> 29:42.015
Kitty Walker was your closest friend.

29:42.015 --> 29:44.335
Count Leoline was the chief suspect.

29:44.335 --> 29:48.135
And if he'd done it, he would have
hung for it. Not necessarily.

29:48.135 --> 29:50.315
The evidence was circumstantial.

29:50.315 --> 29:53.095
I saw you strike
Count Leoline yesterday.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.015
I thought he'd killed my friend.

29:55.015 --> 29:59.575
You're telling me you had
no desire to seek revenge for
your best friend's murder?

29:59.575 --> 30:02.455
No. That would be a lie.

30:02.455 --> 30:05.995
But the truth is, I've never thrown
a knife in my whole life.

30:14.915 --> 30:16.455
You believe her?

30:16.455 --> 30:22.035
For now. But I can't think of
anyone else who would have wanted
revenge for Kitty Walker's murder.

30:22.035 --> 30:25.015
Then perhaps this has nothing
to do with Kitty's revenge.

30:25.015 --> 30:27.495
Which puts us back to one killer.

30:27.495 --> 30:29.135
Who would want them both dead?

30:31.695 --> 30:36.175
You think I killed them?
Sit down, Mr Barnett.

30:38.195 --> 30:41.295
Did you know that Leoline
and Miss Walker were planning

30:41.295 --> 30:45.315
to leave your circus and take
the best performers with them?

30:45.315 --> 30:47.895
Yes. I heard the rumours.

30:47.895 --> 30:49.895
They were deluding themselves.

30:49.895 --> 30:51.735
Oh? How so?

30:51.735 --> 30:55.175
There are a half-dozen travelling
circuses on the Great Lakes circuit.

30:55.175 --> 30:57.575
This is a very tough business.

30:57.575 --> 30:59.295
They wouldn't have stood a chance.

30:59.295 --> 31:01.815
They could have tried. They did try.

31:01.815 --> 31:04.055
Nobody would go with them.

31:04.055 --> 31:06.795
They didn't mind Kitty, but Leo...

31:06.795 --> 31:10.375
The freaks resented his
pretensions, and the normals...

31:10.375 --> 31:14.855
Let's just say the normals wouldn't
like working for any freak,
let alone Leo.

31:14.855 --> 31:16.975
Why is that? They resent them.

31:16.975 --> 31:20.115
The freaks make more money
and they have no talent.

31:20.115 --> 31:26.315
Normals feel superior to the freaks
and Leo felt superior to everybody.

31:26.315 --> 31:33.195
They had to fire him from his
last circus because their best
performers would not work with him.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.875
Imagine how they'd feel
about working FOR him.

31:37.955 --> 31:40.435
What have you, George?

31:40.435 --> 31:45.555
We interviewed the prisoners again,
and while everybody seemed
to dislike Count Leoline,

31:45.555 --> 31:48.035
nobody confessed a grudge
strong enough to kill him.

31:48.035 --> 31:49.775
Most just found him annoying.

31:49.775 --> 31:52.855
Did anyone have any
insight into his murder?

31:52.855 --> 31:56.215
Lady Minerva seemed to think it
had something to do with love.

31:56.215 --> 31:59.175
Did she now? It wasn't love.

31:59.175 --> 32:01.295
The Lovers card was reversed.

32:01.295 --> 32:04.035
What happened here
grew from the dark side of love.

32:05.835 --> 32:08.455
What else do the cards tell you,
Lady Minerva?

32:19.815 --> 32:21.875
How strange.

32:21.875 --> 32:24.835
These are the same
cards I drew last night.

32:24.835 --> 32:26.995
It's happening again.

32:30.135 --> 32:32.195
Is that the best you can do? Agh!

32:35.175 --> 32:37.995
That's enough! Come on!

32:37.995 --> 32:41.495
What's going on? He made a joke about
Kitty! Not yet in her grave!

32:41.495 --> 32:43.075
Sir!

32:43.075 --> 32:44.935
BRACKENREID: What's going on?

32:50.515 --> 32:52.095
He's dead, sir.
GASPING

32:52.095 --> 32:55.115
It was just a gut punch. I swear.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.800
Jake The Magician
was stabbed to death.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.620
I beg your pardon?
There wasn't a scratch on him.

33:11.620 --> 33:14.500
That's because he was
stabbed from the inside.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.260
I found this
switchblade in his stomach.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.520
The punch must have
triggered the spring.

33:22.620 --> 33:26.840
Jake had it in his stomach
the whole time? I believe Jake
regurgitated the knife,

33:26.840 --> 33:29.780
it was used to kill Leoline
and then he swallowed it again.

33:29.780 --> 33:31.340
So, that's the killer then?

33:31.340 --> 33:33.420
I don't think so. How's that?

33:33.420 --> 33:36.040
Jake was in the cell
to the left of Count Leoline.

33:36.040 --> 33:39.140
He couldn't have thrown the knife. I
believe a second party was involved.

33:39.140 --> 33:43.520
The knife thrower. And you're hoping
to find that person's fingermarks?

33:43.520 --> 33:46.120
Hoping. If the stomach acids
didn't degrade them completely.

33:49.300 --> 33:50.760
Have a look, sir.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.000
It's a fingermark.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.980
On the part of the blade
that folds into the casing.

33:58.980 --> 34:01.300
The stomach acids must
not have reached it.

34:01.300 --> 34:04.160
It's a very small fingermark. Yes.

34:04.160 --> 34:07.000
Bloody hell,
don't tell me the midget did it!

34:11.320 --> 34:14.239
Sir, I don't think this
fingermark is human.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.280
Oh, no!

34:27.860 --> 34:29.400
Well?

34:32.300 --> 34:34.020
It's a match, sir.

34:34.020 --> 34:36.120
Of course it's a match.
Who else could it belong to?

34:37.280 --> 34:40.960
Did the monkey do it then?
I don't believe so.

34:40.960 --> 34:44.780
The thumb print is on
the hilt of the blade,
as if the monkey was pulling it out.

34:44.780 --> 34:47.260
Yes. That makes sense.

34:47.260 --> 34:54.679
I believe Jake regurgitated
the knife, handed it to Athena,
who then brought it to someone else.

34:54.679 --> 34:58.900
And that person threw it, killing
Count Leo. Athena then
retrieved the knife,

34:58.900 --> 35:03.200
brought it back to Jake,
who folded it and swallowed it anew.
Bloody genius!

35:03.200 --> 35:07.360
Were it not for an unfortunate punch,
we may have never learned the truth.
We still don't have the whole story.

35:07.360 --> 35:10.400
Who actually threw the knife?
KNOCK ON DOOR

35:10.400 --> 35:12.520
Ah, Doctor. What have you?

35:12.520 --> 35:15.040
I've compared Miss Walker's
wound with Count Leoline's.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.180
I'm certain the same knife
was used in both crimes.

35:17.180 --> 35:18.840
I expected as much.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.340
So, Jake killed Kitty? Possibly.

35:21.340 --> 35:23.360
Although he did have an alibi.

35:23.360 --> 35:26.020
Miss Ivy claims he was
with her at the time.

35:26.020 --> 35:29.580
No, I said he was with me
when Saber escaped.

35:29.580 --> 35:34.140
So you think Jake had time to
kill Miss Walker? Indeed, I do.

35:34.140 --> 35:36.920
Why not simply tell me this before?

35:36.920 --> 35:41.600
I suppose I was resistant
to the notion that my lover
could be a murderer.

35:41.600 --> 35:46.900
Well, you'll be relieved to
know that there is no way Jake
could have killed Count Leoline.

35:46.900 --> 35:49.320
But I thought...

35:49.320 --> 35:52.700
You said Jake was carrying
a knife in his gullet.

35:52.700 --> 35:58.260
Yes, but the knife was thrown
from one of the cells the
other side of Count Leoline.

35:58.260 --> 36:01.480
Perhaps the cell you were in.

36:01.480 --> 36:04.780
So now you think I killed my
best friend and her fiance?

36:04.780 --> 36:08.800
Count Leoline told me he had rejected
you in favour of Miss Walker.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.940
My God, that man thought
highly of himself!

36:12.940 --> 36:16.920
I attempted once to seduce him.
I'd just arrived in the circus.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.380
I didn't even know he was engaged.

36:19.420 --> 36:21.060
At my last circus,

36:21.060 --> 36:24.520
a woman even tried to kill herself
because I refused her.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.860
Where did you get these scars?
None of your business.

36:29.860 --> 36:33.060
Miss Ivy, what circus
were you at prior to this one?

36:36.140 --> 36:38.840
I believe I am done talking, sir.

36:43.020 --> 36:45.220
I'm afraid I can't tell you
very much about Ivy.

36:45.220 --> 36:47.140
She just showed up one day,

36:47.140 --> 36:50.880
told me the story of her momma
and the poison ivy.

36:50.880 --> 36:54.360
She's a beguiling one.
I hired her on the spot.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.900
How did she get those scars?

36:57.900 --> 37:01.320
I would guess she had someone
do them for her.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.240
It would have been painful.

37:03.240 --> 37:06.840
Every vein of every leaf would
have to be cut in with a razor.

37:07.860 --> 37:10.380
What about the scars on her wrists?

37:10.380 --> 37:13.280
I don't know how she got those.
She never told me.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.140
I don't believe she
ever told anyone.

37:17.200 --> 37:21.460
You mentioned before that
Count Leoline was fired
from his last circus.

37:21.460 --> 37:26.420
Do you recall which one that was?
The Ringling Brothers, I believe.
Why?

37:26.420 --> 37:31.640
Sir... The Ringling Brothers
have never had any performer
by Ivy's name or description.

37:31.640 --> 37:34.660
What about Count Leoline? Yes.
He worked with them until last year.

37:34.660 --> 37:37.280
He was fired for being difficult,
apparently. No surprise there.

37:37.280 --> 37:41.100
The Ringling Brothers circus
came through town a couple of
years ago, did it not?

37:41.100 --> 37:43.360
Yes, sir. I took my aunt.
It was a splendid show.

37:43.360 --> 37:47.860
Although the elephant did choose
a rather unfortunate time to...
Thank you, George.

37:47.860 --> 37:53.100
Contact the Toronto Telegraph
and see if they have any Ringling
Brothers photographs on file.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.580
Yes, sir...

37:55.580 --> 37:58.520
Have you saved
the best for last again?

37:58.520 --> 38:02.900
They also had in their employ
a Gypsy fortune-teller
by the name of Lady Minerva.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.020
Very good, George.

38:07.020 --> 38:10.600
Forget the cards, Lady Minerva.
I'm not interested in my future.

38:10.600 --> 38:12.600
What I want to know about
is your past.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.940
I'm afraid
my memory isn't very good.

38:15.940 --> 38:19.820
Does it extend as far back as the
Ringling Brothers circus, by chance?

38:20.820 --> 38:23.080
I have some hazy recollections.

38:23.080 --> 38:26.100
Was Count Leoline there?
Why ask what you already know?

38:26.100 --> 38:28.380
Was Ivy there?

38:28.380 --> 38:32.900
Ivy wasn't. Who was there then?

38:39.640 --> 38:42.060
Pick one.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.820
Queen of Swords.

38:49.820 --> 38:52.140
What does this mean? Nothing.

38:52.140 --> 38:56.300
Unless you look past
what your eyes can see.

38:58.340 --> 39:01.380
KNOCK ON DOOR
Sir, a package from the Telegraph.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.560
Archived photographs of
the Ringling Brothers.

39:03.560 --> 39:06.280
Thank you, George. Sir, I've
spoke with a tarot card reader.

39:06.280 --> 39:11.340
Apparently, the Queen of Swords is
from the Minor Arcana and represents

39:11.340 --> 39:14.880
the masculine and the feminine
at conflict.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.980
Or some such thing,
I didn't entirely understand.

39:20.620 --> 39:24.540
I don't think Lady Minerva meant for
us to understand the card, George.

39:24.540 --> 39:26.180
How's that, sir?

39:26.180 --> 39:29.560
She meant for us
to take it literally.

39:32.540 --> 39:34.700
Where did you get this?

39:36.300 --> 39:40.320
It was taken the last time
the Ringling Brothers
circus came through town.

39:41.340 --> 39:43.480
I remember.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.000
I'd just met Leo.

39:47.040 --> 39:52.660
I look happy, don't I?
I was a pretty girl.

39:52.660 --> 39:55.480
Just Liz, from Calgary, back then.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.340
You were in love with him,
weren't you?

40:01.340 --> 40:06.180
He was magnificent. Such...

40:06.180 --> 40:09.620
confidence and power.

40:09.620 --> 40:11.800
I melted in his arms.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.260
Melted away.

40:15.420 --> 40:17.920
I would have given my life to him...

40:19.500 --> 40:21.120
..but he wouldn't have me.

40:22.380 --> 40:24.120
He said...

40:24.120 --> 40:27.240
he was a freak and I was a normal.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.280
I felt like I...

40:31.860 --> 40:34.260
..died right then.

40:35.980 --> 40:39.640
I couldn't throw anymore.
My hands shook.

40:41.260 --> 40:43.620
Is that when you decided
to take your own life?

40:46.120 --> 40:50.100
When my wrists healed,
they left scars.

40:50.100 --> 40:52.540
That gave me my idea.

40:52.540 --> 40:54.980
To scar yourself as Ivy?

40:54.980 --> 40:59.240
If I made myself into a freak,
then we could be together.

41:00.820 --> 41:02.980
So I cut my beauty away.

41:06.080 --> 41:10.000
And you joined Barnett's Circus,
so you could be with Leoline?

41:11.580 --> 41:14.120
I tried to seduce him.

41:14.120 --> 41:16.780
Do you know,
he didn't even recognise me?

41:16.780 --> 41:20.260
And when I found out
he was engaged to a normal...

41:21.920 --> 41:24.860
That's when you decided
to kill them both?

41:24.860 --> 41:27.320
That's when I decided to kill HER.

41:28.860 --> 41:30.440
Then what was Jake's part?

41:30.440 --> 41:35.540
He swallowed the knife,
gave me an alibi.

41:35.540 --> 41:38.460
He loved me.

41:38.460 --> 41:40.100
But you wanted Leoline.

41:43.400 --> 41:47.500
I offered myself
to him again yesterday.

41:47.500 --> 41:54.080
I told him I'd tell the truth,
that I saw him pass by my caravan,
if he would have me.

41:56.060 --> 41:58.260
He said he'd rather hang.

41:59.960 --> 42:03.940
That's when I decided to kill him.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.340
Was it worth it,

42:09.340 --> 42:13.500
to give up everything for this man?

42:13.500 --> 42:15.860
Your beauty. Your identity.

42:15.860 --> 42:17.600
Your life.

42:19.180 --> 42:20.660
I had to try.

42:22.700 --> 42:27.260
Wouldn't you give up everything for
the love of your life, Detective?

42:44.780 --> 42:47.800
Cheer up, Murdoch.
You've solved your murder.

42:47.800 --> 42:51.340
The rules of Habeas Corpus remain
unbreached and we finally get to
kick this lot out

42:51.340 --> 42:52.820
before we have to feed them supper.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.860
I understand, sir.

42:54.860 --> 42:58.380
But two people are dead and one
will likely hang because of...love.

42:58.380 --> 43:00.860
It's not all sunshine
and roses, is it?

43:00.860 --> 43:02.880
Inspector...

43:02.880 --> 43:06.180
I'm sorry to tell you that
Athena will be coming with us.

43:06.180 --> 43:08.020
You finally get to flee,
do you, Barnett?

43:08.020 --> 43:09.920
They say the show must go on,

43:09.920 --> 43:12.380
but after what's happened,
I don't know how it can.

43:12.380 --> 43:14.340
I'm sure you'll find a way.

43:16.160 --> 43:20.760
And you, Athena, be a good girl
and none of this abetting
in a murder business.

43:23.640 --> 43:26.620
What will happen to her?
What if the circus shuts?
Do you want me to send you

43:26.620 --> 43:28.440
a telegram when we know either way?

43:28.440 --> 43:30.460
Don't be silly.

43:30.460 --> 43:32.040
Perhaps a postcard.

43:38.460 --> 43:39.940
Au revoir.

43:51.580 --> 43:53.860
What are you smiling at, George?

43:53.860 --> 43:58.000
Just something Lady Minerva told me
about my future.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.780
Oh? Do tell. I couldn't possibly,
sir.

44:00.780 --> 44:05.880
If I told you, I would curse it,
and if I did that... Detective,
would you like another reading?

44:06.860 --> 44:08.940
Oh, I don't think so, Lady Minerva.

44:08.940 --> 44:11.980
Your last one predicted
a lovelorn future.

44:11.980 --> 44:13.500
The future is never fixed.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.360
Come, have a seat.

44:18.940 --> 44:21.460
So, what would you like to know?

44:23.040 --> 44:28.060
Well, I suppose if the woman
I love will be in my future.

44:29.620 --> 44:31.320
Yes.

44:31.320 --> 44:34.040
The woman you love
will be in your future.

44:34.040 --> 44:37.440
But you will have to make
a very great sacrifice.

44:37.440 --> 44:41.300
What kind of sacrifice?
I don't know,

44:41.300 --> 44:43.420
but you will...

44:45.080 --> 44:46.660
..when the time comes.

44:47.305 --> 44:53.359
