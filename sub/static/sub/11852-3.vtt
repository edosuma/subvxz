13:57.470 --> 13:59.062
Hey, Frosty.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.570
Helena, why such a stranger?

14:01.741 --> 14:04.141
Oh, you know. All work, no play.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.504
The usual lor me, Frosty.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.374
And il memory serves,
vodka rocks lor the lady.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.606
Coming up.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.841
So the mysterious
and provocative Huntress...

14:12.018 --> 14:15.476
...has chosen once again to grace me
with her presence. It‘s been too long.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.714
Funny. To me,
it never quite seems long enough.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.688

seven minutes and three seconds.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.555
-Stop it.
-Can‘t.

taste, touch or smell.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.196
That‘s my gilt and my curse.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.494
I thought your curse
was to be the metahuman...

14:29.669 --> 14:31.637
...with the world‘s most annoying power.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.462

14:34.540 --> 14:36.235

14:36.409 --> 14:38.502
It looks like by someone
with the same powers.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.475
Have you heard anything?

14:41.013 --> 14:42.105
GIBSON:
Nothing.

14:42.281 --> 14:45.478
In lact, I‘ve never heard ol two metas
with exact power overlap.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.312
Do you think that‘s even possible?

14:47.754 --> 14:51.281
I don‘t know what I think.
Something strange is going on, though.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.586
Thank you lor the drink.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.325
Yeah, no problem.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.260
I‘ll, uh, put it on your tab.
Oh, that‘s right, you don‘t have one.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.526
Because that would require more
than a semi-annual visit.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.727
Tell me something,
is it the cocktail peanuts...

15:04.904 --> 15:07.737
...or the meta-only policy
that makes you so uncomlortable?

15:07.907 --> 15:11.001

-They always are.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.241

15:16.549 --> 15:20.417

another round with us poor lost souls?

in my mind again?

in the Yellow Pages.

dillerent here, you know?

17:13.833 --> 17:16.028

and they won‘t talk to me.

to institutionalized torture.

because every new kid‘s a lreak.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.546
I just don‘t see the point
ol going to high school.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.685

A superhero.

-I don‘t want a normal Iile.

to be a regular meta.

It‘s not all that it‘s cracked up to be.

18:09.188 --> 18:11.053

They call themselves metahumans...

18:11.524 --> 18:15.654

is dangerous.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.227
Let me get this straight.

18:17.396 --> 18:20.263
Every metahuman has a dillerent ability.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.401
But you can‘t tell by looking
what they can do.

18:22.568 --> 18:25.366
-That‘s right.
-And they look just like regular people.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.200
-They‘re everywhere.
-Ha. Okay, so, what you‘re telling me...

18:28.374 --> 18:31.036
...is there‘s this secret subculture
right underneath our noses.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.438

18:32.612 --> 18:34.637

18:37.783 --> 18:40.343
A generation ago, there was a man...

18:40.519 --> 18:43.044
...a vigilante
who prowled New Gotham‘s nights...

18:43.222 --> 18:45.190

18:57.003 --> 18:59.403
...and he does it dressed
as a giant llying rodent?

18:59.572 --> 19:01.870
I think it‘s sale to assume
he had some issues.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.531
He called himsell the Batman.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.574
Oh, okay, that‘s creative.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.508
Oh, I didn‘t make it up.

19:07.680 --> 19:12.583
The point is, he attracted criminals.
It was a prestige thing to light him.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.118
You know, make your mark
in the underworld.

19:16.188 --> 19:19.521
That only explains why there are
so many criminals here in New Gotham.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.024
-A|| metahumans can‘t be criminals.
-Why not?

19:22.194 --> 19:25.595
Their kind is drawn to crime,
they think they‘re above the law.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.690
What about this llying bat guy?

19:27.867 --> 19:30.802
-He lought crime. He was a metahuman.
-No, no, no.

19:30.970 --> 19:35.134
He was human all the way, he just,
you know, had a scary dress sense.

19:35.307 --> 19:38.799

years ago, but the metahumans stayed...
