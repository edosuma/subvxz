03:16.405 --> 03:18.032
<i>Seattle Today!</i>

03:26.290 --> 03:29.043
<i>I am the captain
of the Pinafore!</i>

03:29.126 --> 03:31.253
<i>And a right good captain too!</i>

03:31.337 --> 03:32.963
<i>You're very, very good but...</i>

03:34.924 --> 03:36.133
It's almost ready, you guys.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.929
We'll be right down.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.226
<i>...occasionally say...</i>

03:45.309 --> 03:47.102
<i>I'm never, never sick at sea.</i>

03:47.144 --> 03:48.646
<i>- What never?
- No, never.</i>

03:48.729 --> 03:52.483
<i>- What, never?
- Well, hardly ever!</i>

04:13.045 --> 04:14.880
Michael!

04:14.964 --> 04:16.507
Emma, stay right there.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.970
What's the matter?

04:23.055 --> 04:24.848
Claire, stay here.

04:26.642 --> 04:27.643
Mommy?

04:39.363 --> 04:40.364
Hey!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.701
- Sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.286
What are you doing here?

04:45.369 --> 04:47.871
- Mommy?
- It's okay, sweetheart.

04:59.925 --> 05:03.137
This gentleman says
the Better Way Society sent him.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.763
Better Day.

05:04.847 --> 05:07.182
- Sorry. Better Day Society.
- Yeah.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.102
Yeah. The Better Day Society
helps place

05:10.185 --> 05:12.896
the mentally disabled with employment.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.028
I live there.

05:19.528 --> 05:22.781
Of course!
You're here to build the fence.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.450
Yeah.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.368
I tried knocking.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.370
Solomon, right?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.081
Rene Peterson told us
about the work you did.

05:31.206 --> 05:35.085
I'm Claire
and this is my husband, Michael.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.631
- Yeah, we met outside.
- And this is Emma.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.633
Hello.

05:42.343 --> 05:45.304
It's nice to make your acquaintance,
Emma.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.974
I'm gonna throw some shoes on,
show Solomon around outside.

05:49.058 --> 05:52.353
See if our guest would like
anything to drink. Okay?

05:52.436 --> 05:55.189
My mom says to ask
if you want anything.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.609
I'd like a brand-new bicycle

05:58.650 --> 06:03.572
with a big basket on the handlebars
and some gears.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.866
That sounds neat.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.706
Okay, okay. I see.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.337
You wanted to take away this?

06:19.671 --> 06:20.714
Yeah.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.383
Yeah.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.386
The new fence should contain
the whole area here,

06:24.468 --> 06:27.054
and the gate should be right there.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.061
Do you want the fence

06:34.144 --> 06:35.354
to keep people in,

06:38.315 --> 06:39.566
or keep people out?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.404
Well, both.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.657
But mostly, it should keep people out.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.743
Okay.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.453
Okay.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.415
One,

06:54.498 --> 06:56.333
two,

06:56.417 --> 06:58.627
three,

06:58.669 --> 06:59.670
five,

07:00.546 --> 07:01.547
nine.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.969
Just kidding.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.893
I got a tape measure. See?

07:15.394 --> 07:19.022
All right. Is everything
all right out here?

07:22.192 --> 07:24.528
Right as rain.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.034
- Mrs. Bartel?
- That's me.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.828
The doctor will see you now.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.039
This is your first exam with Dr. Mott?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.791
Yes, it is.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.043
The doctor who delivered
my little girl retired.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.172
Dr. Mott was kind enough
to take me on midterm.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.550
He's one of the best.
Expecting his own, you know?

07:46.633 --> 07:47.885
Really?

07:47.926 --> 07:50.804
Take everything off,
put the gown on, open at the front.

07:50.888 --> 07:51.889
Okay.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.560
Doctor.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.021
Mrs. Bartel!

07:59.062 --> 08:01.064
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Dr. Mott.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.734
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

08:03.775 --> 08:07.321
So, how are we today?

08:07.404 --> 08:09.406
Just great.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.576
The baby's kicking up a storm all day.

08:12.659 --> 08:16.413
This is your second child.
You're a pro at this, aren't you?

08:17.664 --> 08:20.459
I see you have a history of asthma.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.294
- Any problems?
- No, none at all.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.421
Why don't we take a look? Feet up.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.881
Okay.

08:25.923 --> 08:29.510
I didn't think it was usual to give
pelvic exams after the third month.

08:29.593 --> 08:33.138
We won't again until the 36th week.

08:33.222 --> 08:36.265
But I want to make sure my new patients

08:36.350 --> 08:39.144
have a full exam on their first visit.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.941
It's Mrs. Miller.
She's calling again for the test results.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.278
Go ahead and give them to her.
She's all clear.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.156
If she has any questions,
I'll call her back.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.408
Would you hold, please?

08:53.784 --> 08:56.620
Maria, when you're in the lab,

08:56.662 --> 08:59.164
call in the results
of yesterday's ViraPaps.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.083
Yes, Doctor.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.088
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.840
Why don't we start
with the breast exam?

09:15.347 --> 09:17.307
Weather's been beautiful these days,
hasn't it?

09:18.809 --> 09:20.477
It has. Yeah.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.398
I love taking walks after the rainstorm.

09:46.753 --> 09:50.674
It's very important to be able
to give yourself your own breast exams.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.055
Relax.

10:24.541 --> 10:28.045
Mrs. Bartel, we need to schedule
your next appointment.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.020
- Claire?
- Michael!

11:27.104 --> 11:29.564
- Honey, what's the matter?
- Michael.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.111
Honey, what's wrong? Claire?

11:36.655 --> 11:39.116
It was the way he was touching me.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.619
He wasn't examining me. It was like...

11:46.331 --> 11:47.457
He was getting off on it.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.460
I mean...

11:51.628 --> 11:54.172
What if I accused him and I was wrong?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.299
Do you think you're wrong now?

11:58.009 --> 11:59.344
No.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.097
Then we have to file a complaint.

12:02.305 --> 12:06.309
- Michael, I don't think I can do that.
- Claire, listen to me.

12:07.686 --> 12:10.313
If we don't report this,

12:10.355 --> 12:13.358
he's gonna do the same thing
to somebody else.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.237
You have to trust yourself.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.991
I don't think I can, Michael.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.909
I think you can.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.458
We'll go through it together.

12:30.876 --> 12:34.212
<i>Even with food
and supplies flown into the area daily,</i>

12:34.296 --> 12:37.632
<i>the aid is not reaching
many of the refugees.</i>

12:38.300 --> 12:41.803
<i>Dr. Victor Mott, Seattle gynecologist
and obstetrician,</i>

12:41.845 --> 12:45.682
<i>was brought up today on charges
by the District Attorney's office.</i>

12:45.724 --> 12:49.519
<i>The scandal began last week
when one of Mott's pregnant patients</i>

12:49.561 --> 12:51.104
<i>went to the state medical board,</i>

12:51.188 --> 12:56.067
<i>claiming she was sexually molested
by the doctor during an examination.</i>

12:56.151 --> 13:00.530
<i>Since the patient's initial accusation,
four more women have come forward</i>

13:00.572 --> 13:05.285
<i>alleging that they, too,
had been sexually molested.</i>

13:05.368 --> 13:09.039
<i>Citing the possibility of criminal
misdeeds, the state medical board</i>

13:09.206 --> 13:11.366
<i>turned the case over to the
District Attorney's office.</i>

13:12.375 --> 13:14.920
<i>Dr. Mott was unavailable for comment.</i>

13:35.941 --> 13:37.651
<i>The suicide provision is quite clear.</i>

13:37.943 --> 13:39.983
However, we may be able to get
the insurance company

13:40.028 --> 13:42.197
to return a small settlement.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.408
Mrs. Mott, although your husband
had sizeable assets,

13:45.575 --> 13:48.203
they've been frozen by the state.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.746
Frozen.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.957
This is normal procedure
when the estate

13:52.082 --> 13:56.086
is probably going to be sued
by a number of sources.

13:56.127 --> 13:59.631
You are free to stay in the house
until you have your baby,

13:59.714 --> 14:02.425
but you should begin
to make alternative plans.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.971
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Mott.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.269
Can I help?

14:32.163 --> 14:33.483
Get an ambulance here right away!

14:33.790 --> 14:35.375
My baby-

14:42.340 --> 14:44.175
We'll need blood.

14:45.427 --> 14:47.804
Four units cross-matched now!

14:47.929 --> 14:50.473
- I want vital signs!
- Pediatrics is standing by.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.684
- My baby.
- Now lift.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.771
She's hemorrhaging.
Get this baby out or we'll lose them both.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.108
- I feel it kicking.
- You can?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.237
Keep her still.

15:04.321 --> 15:08.158
Can't stop this blood. Call Anesthesia.
I'm gonna operate.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.243
Chest compressions are reducing.

15:11.286 --> 15:12.495
We're losing him!

15:12.871 --> 15:15.832
No!

15:22.005 --> 15:23.506
Hold her down.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.009
- He's gone.
- No.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.386
Anesthesiologist is on the way.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.682
Increase the drip to 90.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.726
Her pressure is 80 over 40.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.272
- She didn't touch it.
- Emergency hysterectomy.

15:39.356 --> 15:42.817
She's been so depressed,
she won't talk. Let me try.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.071
<i>...against the late
Victor Mott's estate.</i>

15:46.154 --> 15:49.783
<i>The suits were filed by four women
who claim they had been molested.</i>

15:49.866 --> 15:51.368
You have got to eat.

15:51.451 --> 15:55.455
<i>The investigation was dropped
when Dr. Mott was found dead</i>

15:55.538 --> 15:58.375
<i>from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</i>

15:58.458 --> 16:00.627
<i>Claire Bartel has not filed a suit,</i>

16:00.710 --> 16:02.379
<i>although she was the first
to accuse Mott</i>

16:02.420 --> 16:04.422
<i>of molesting her during an exam.</i>

16:05.632 --> 16:07.300
I'll leave your food.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.220
<i>Her accusation prompted
the other women to come forward</i>

16:29.239 --> 16:31.408
I'm coming up to the back door.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.077
I'm getting close to the back door.

16:34.494 --> 16:38.248
I am now entering the back door.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.166
Good morning, Solomon.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.584
Good morning.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.671
Thank you.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.550
Hi, little baby.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.677
Get back here. I got you!

16:53.930 --> 16:55.015
Sorry, Mom.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.601
Don't cry, baby.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.979
Yes, that's a big boy.

17:01.062 --> 17:05.108
Thank you, Solomon.
Don't cry, sweetheart.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.694
Remember the rule
at the Better Day Society?

17:07.777 --> 17:09.779
They said it's best
if you didn't handle the baby.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.449
I'm sorry. I forgot.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.911
- I only wanted to help.
- I know you did. Thanks.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.795
They're replacing the greenhouses
at the botanical gardens.

17:25.878 --> 17:29.299
- I might get one of the frames.
- Let me guess.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.718
You want to build your own greenhouse.

17:33.136 --> 17:36.222
Yeah!
The frame's there, the hardware's there.

17:36.306 --> 17:40.060
All I'd have to do is erect it
and replace the glass.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.482
Honey, don't you think
you're taking on too much?

17:46.232 --> 17:48.193
Have you given any more thought
to hiring a nanny?

17:48.443 --> 17:52.155
I'm not comfortable
having any of the girls I interviewed

17:52.238 --> 17:53.239
take care of Joey.

17:53.490 --> 17:57.077
Claire, it's not like when we had Emma.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.496
You don't need to do
everything yourself.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.791
What about Solomon?
He could be our nanny.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.462
Honey, I don't think Solomon
would make a very good nanny.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.172
Why not?

18:09.255 --> 18:10.507
Remember we had the talk

18:10.548 --> 18:12.509
about what a special person
Solomon is?

18:12.801 --> 18:13.843
Yeah.

18:13.968 --> 18:17.597
Well, there are some things
that he can't do.

18:18.598 --> 18:23.311
What's gonna happen to Solomon
when he finishes painting the trim?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.021
Well,

18:25.772 --> 18:27.273
when he finishes painting the trim,

18:27.357 --> 18:30.527
I guess we'll have to find
something else for him to do.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.612
Okay?

18:32.695 --> 18:34.072
Okay.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.407
Hurry up, sweetheart.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.369
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.417
Mrs. Thompson?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.044
Mrs. Thompson!

19:01.057 --> 19:02.517
Thanks.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.603
- Thanks for stopping.
- No problem.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.023
- Here you go, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.986
Thanks. I think it's gonna rain later.
That was nice of you.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.239
- You're welcome.
- Well, thanks. Thank you.

19:16.281 --> 19:19.450
Excuse me, do you know
where the Bartels live?

19:19.534 --> 19:21.244
Well, I'm Claire Bartel.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.873
- Hi. I'm Peyton Flanders.
- Hi.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.000
I was coming about the nanny position.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.086
All right.
You wanna come up to the house?

19:30.170 --> 19:31.504
Yeah.

19:32.213 --> 19:35.758
I can't believe I forgot
I had an appointment.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.303
I'm usually so good about these things.

19:38.386 --> 19:41.014
Actually, I didn't have an appointment.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.142
Did the agency just tell you to stop by?

19:44.225 --> 19:46.853
Well, no. I'm not with an agency.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.647
The truth is,
I've only worked with one family.

19:49.731 --> 19:53.818
They're moving and I didn't know
what I was gonna do next.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.448
I was with their little girl in the park.

19:58.489 --> 20:01.576
Nannies talk and I heard
that your family needed someone.

20:05.038 --> 20:08.124
I shouldn't have showed up.
I've made you uncomfortable.

20:08.166 --> 20:11.711
No, it's fine. You're here, so come on in.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.214
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.229
Usually I have a set of questions
I ask, like,

20:29.312 --> 20:32.857
- "Are you old enough to drive?"
- Thank you.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.992
Here. Don't lose this.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.162
My husband's been after me
to fix this thing.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.873
Well...

20:49.874 --> 20:52.001
How did you come to be a nanny?

20:52.710 --> 20:54.462
Well...

20:55.964 --> 20:57.465
A few years ago, I was pregnant.

20:57.507 --> 21:01.427
I lost the baby and my husband
within days of each other.

21:01.511 --> 21:05.306
The miscarriage prevented me
from having more children.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.599
It was a very difficult time.

21:06.683 --> 21:10.728
A mutual friend set me up with a family
looking for a nanny.

21:10.812 --> 21:15.775
It turned out to be a wonderful
experience for both of us.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.568
I adore children.

21:18.069 --> 21:21.364
I love being with them,
taking care of them.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.116
For me,

21:23.992 --> 21:28.204
it's the next best thing
to actually being a mother.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.999
Well, I'm building my own greenhouse.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.630
And although
I'll just be right in the backyard,

21:34.669 --> 21:37.213
I'm anticipating being very busy.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.387
That's Joe.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.972
I'd love to meet him.

21:47.390 --> 21:50.435
The nursery is across
from the master bedroom.

21:51.561 --> 21:54.355
Claire? I need to ask you something.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.525
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

22:31.934 --> 22:35.104
<i>Comon upstairs and go ahead and try
to open the window from the inside.</i>

22:35.396 --> 22:37.982
If you can't,
just wait till Michael comes home.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.693
Solomon, this is Peyton.
Peyton, Solomon.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.446
- Nice to meet you, Solomon.
- Hello.

22:46.199 --> 22:49.118
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.541
I'm sorry.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.086
That's all right. It was an accident.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.296
Anyone can have an accident.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.135
Okay.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.155
He's beautiful.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.324
He's very hungry-

23:30.701 --> 23:32.495
I've taken up half your morning.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.497
No problem, I really enjoyed it.

23:34.747 --> 23:38.084
I should be going.
I'm gonna leave a letter of reference.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.503
I can show myself out.
You don't have to get up.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.381
Peyton,

23:44.674 --> 23:45.967
would you like
to have dinner with us tonight?

23:46.008 --> 23:47.635
I'd love you to meet the family.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.387
I'd love to.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.681
Good. Say around 6:30?

23:52.098 --> 23:53.182
I'll be here.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.107
I'm in charge of the salad dressing.

24:01.566 --> 24:04.110
And now you're in charge
of setting the table.

24:05.069 --> 24:07.321
Daddy's gonna be home any minute.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.907
What does your husband do?

24:10.199 --> 24:12.076
Michael's a genetic engineer.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.871
He works for a research outfit
called Biotechnics.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.747
Daddy is a mad scientist.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.752
It's Daddy!

24:26.048 --> 24:28.676
- Here, let me help with that.
- Thanks.

24:28.718 --> 24:31.304
Give me a kiss. Thank you very much.

24:31.387 --> 24:35.266
Thank you very much.
You helping Mom out?

24:35.349 --> 24:37.435
What are you shushing me for?

24:37.518 --> 24:39.604
Joey's asleep.
Thank you.

24:44.942 --> 24:47.111
- Hi, beautiful.
- How are you?

24:52.992 --> 24:54.911
Peyton, this is my husband, Michael.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.078
Hi.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.795
I gotta tell you guys, that was
one of the all-time great meals.

25:04.879 --> 25:06.214
It was delicious.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.925
I was in charge of the salad dressing.

25:09.133 --> 25:13.054
That's right. She did.
She made it all by herself.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.645
When Mom finishes the greenhouse,

25:20.728 --> 25:23.439
- I'm in charge of the strawberries.
- Really?

25:23.731 --> 25:26.943
- That sounds like a very important job.
- It is.

25:33.783 --> 25:36.285
She seems terrific. What's the catch?

25:37.453 --> 25:39.580
There is no catch. I think she's great.

25:39.789 --> 25:42.875
I think we can get her
to commit for a year.

25:43.125 --> 25:45.795
- Let's grab her.
- Yeah? Okay.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.008
Oh, my God!

25:52.635 --> 25:55.346
- What happened?
- He had this in his mouth.

25:55.429 --> 25:59.016
- Mommy's earring.
- It must have fallen out.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.476
He's okay.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.645
I'm sorry I frightened everybody.

26:02.687 --> 26:06.607
- I'm glad you caught it.
- I'm glad you got there in time.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.672
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:29.714 --> 26:31.215
This is for you.

26:31.299 --> 26:34.135
Thank you. You didn't have to do that.

26:37.888 --> 26:39.432
That's very pretty.

26:39.515 --> 26:42.518
They say a wind chime
helps a baby sleep.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.104
Why don't we
get you settled downstairs,

26:45.187 --> 26:47.440
then we'll hang it up
outside the nursery.

27:00.453 --> 27:04.040
This is a little bit dark,
but your room gets more light.

27:05.416 --> 27:08.586
This is the laundry room.

27:14.175 --> 27:16.218
And this is your room.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.598
It's perfect.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.058
Like it?

29:33.814 --> 29:35.316
There we go.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.783
Yes.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.515
Mom, look! We did it.

30:08.224 --> 30:11.393
Boy! Let's see.

30:14.271 --> 30:17.608
- Emma, you can certainly shovel!
- Thank you.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.360
How pretty!

30:22.196 --> 30:24.240
It looks just like your house.

30:24.323 --> 30:29.078
I know. We put it out every year
when the martins come back.

30:32.248 --> 30:33.541
Who are the Martins?

30:34.917 --> 30:36.418
They're large swallows.

30:36.460 --> 30:39.171
The same family comes back
every year to visit us.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.298
Yeah.

30:42.967 --> 30:44.426
I would come back, too.

30:51.267 --> 30:53.769
That is a beautiful bracelet, Claire.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.730
I got that at an antique show.

30:57.273 --> 31:00.234
- You can borrow it anytime.
- Well, thank you.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.781
This must be a special occasion.

31:06.282 --> 31:09.785
I always feel sexy and glamorous
when I wear this dress.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.121
It's a present from Michael.

31:13.789 --> 31:17.126
Okay, which shoes should I wear,
red or black?

31:17.918 --> 31:21.630
- Are you wearing a jacket?
- Yeah. Well,

31:21.964 --> 31:23.465
no. Maybe not.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.594
- Then I'd go with the black.
- You think so?

31:29.722 --> 31:30.848
Yeah, I guess you're right.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.314
That's them. Now I'm really late.

31:38.939 --> 31:41.692
- Where are you guys?
- Oh, we're running late.

31:41.775 --> 31:44.945
- Does Marlene want to come in?
- Nah, she's on the phone.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.450
Damn.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.995
- What is it?
- It's a stain.

31:54.997 --> 31:58.500
It's perfume oil.
I must have perfume oil on my hands.

31:58.709 --> 32:01.462
- I'll go get some club soda.
- Thanks.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.932
Marty, this is Peyton.

32:14.725 --> 32:16.810
- Hello, Peyton.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

32:17.019 --> 32:19.480
- I need to get something for Claire.
- Okay.

32:22.483 --> 32:25.110
Maybe we should go ahead
and have kids.

32:30.199 --> 32:33.619
I want to inform you
this place will not hold our table.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.579
- Hello, Marlene.
- Hello.

32:37.373 --> 32:39.208
What's with you?

32:39.291 --> 32:41.877
What do you mean? Nothing's with me.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.217
Nothing my ass.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.553
Hi, I don't believe we've met.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.932
I'm Marlene Craven.
You must be Peyton.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.642
Nice to meet you.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.394
- Poison.
- Excuse me?

32:58.477 --> 33:01.397
The perfume.
You're wearing Claire's perfume.

33:02.398 --> 33:04.733
Well, Claire needs me upstairs.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.242
You look great.

33:20.624 --> 33:23.085
- You don't think that's funny?
- No.

33:28.382 --> 33:30.050
There she is.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.845
- Hi.
- Sorry.

33:33.429 --> 33:35.347
Hi. You look great!

33:36.181 --> 33:38.851
I thought you were going to wear
that dress I got you.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.729
Is there something wrong
with what I'm wearing?

33:41.770 --> 33:45.524
That's not what I meant.
Boy, you look good!

33:45.774 --> 33:48.694
- You look beautiful.
- Let's go. I'm starving.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.054
You have the number where we'll be.

33:52.156 --> 33:54.074
I do. Have fun.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.285
Bye.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.463
<i>Zombies.
The living dead.</i>

34:07.504 --> 34:11.467
This is great!
Mom never lets me watch these movies.

34:12.051 --> 34:14.762
That's why we have to keep it a secret.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.639
Do you know what a secret is, Emma?

34:17.681 --> 34:21.143
Yeah, something you can't tell anybody.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.896
- No matter what.
- That's right.

34:23.978 --> 34:27.524
Now we have our own little secret club.
That's our sign.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.447
It was fun meeting
your Aunt Marlene and Uncle Marty.

34:34.947 --> 34:37.159
They've known your mom and dad
a long time?

34:37.242 --> 34:38.994
Aunt Marlene grew up with Daddy.

34:39.578 --> 34:43.956
They were boyfriend and girlfriend
when they were little.

34:43.998 --> 34:47.835
Is that right?
Do you have any boyfriends?

34:49.463 --> 34:52.341
- No, I hate boys.
- You do?

34:53.675 --> 34:57.554
If I tell you something,
you promise not to tell anybody?

34:57.638 --> 35:00.265
I promise. Secret club.

35:01.433 --> 35:05.687
Well, this mean kid at school,
his name is Roth,

35:05.771 --> 35:08.023
he's been really mean to me.

35:08.065 --> 35:10.818
But he said if I told, I'd be dead meat.

35:11.527 --> 35:13.237
He said that to you?

35:13.946 --> 35:15.906
Did your mother do anything about it?

35:15.989 --> 35:19.076
She tried, but she couldn't help.

35:27.209 --> 35:31.088
You never, ever let an attractive woman
take a power position in your home.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.340
- It's bad business.
- A power position.

35:33.382 --> 35:38.887
You heard what I said.
What's that saying?

35:38.971 --> 35:42.099
- "The hand with the baby" that...
- Hey, Marl?

35:42.182 --> 35:44.810
How much did you get
for the Fletcher house?

35:44.893 --> 35:46.937
Three and change.

35:48.564 --> 35:50.566
All I'm saying is watch your back.

35:52.109 --> 35:54.903
I'm serious! There's too much pressure.

35:55.112 --> 35:58.615
A woman can feel like a failure
if she doesn't bring in 50 grand a year

35:58.699 --> 36:01.535
and still make time for blowjobs
and homemade lasagna.

36:03.996 --> 36:06.248
Marlene's not much of a cook.

36:09.543 --> 36:11.378
I think I'm gonna bum one of these.

36:13.463 --> 36:17.426
You're such a bad influence.
He only smokes around you now.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.221
- One isn't gonna kill me.
- Oh, I got it.

36:22.181 --> 36:26.226
"The hand that rocks the cradle
is the hand that rules the world."

36:44.536 --> 36:48.207
You want to look at the baby? Look.

36:49.458 --> 36:50.626
Hi.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.631
Look, honey. A boy or a girl?

36:55.714 --> 36:58.884
A boy. His name's Joe.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.802
How old?

37:00.886 --> 37:02.971
Three months.

37:03.055 --> 37:06.642
- He is beautiful.
- Thank you.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.352
He has your eyes, you know.

37:12.689 --> 37:13.815
Do you really think so?

37:14.524 --> 37:15.901
Absolutely.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.155
Do you have any other children?

37:20.906 --> 37:23.951
Yes. He has a sister. Her name's Emma.

37:24.701 --> 37:27.120
She looks more like her father though.

37:28.622 --> 37:31.583
We have one more, too,
don't we, sweetheart?

37:39.633 --> 37:42.928
- Peyton.
- Hi, Emma.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.347
Tell me, which one is he? Where?

37:48.642 --> 37:51.436
The one with the blue and gray shirt?

37:53.772 --> 37:55.190
Okay.

38:10.122 --> 38:12.374
- Watch it, trippy!
- Sorry, Roth.

38:12.416 --> 38:14.543
My arm! My arm!

38:16.044 --> 38:20.382
I got a message for you, Roth.
Leave Emma alone. Look at me.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.676
If you don't, I'm gonna rip your head off!

38:25.178 --> 38:28.890
- I get it, ma'am. Let me go!
- Don't forget it.

38:29.558 --> 38:30.892
Awesome!

38:31.518 --> 38:33.395
Wow, that was cool.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.237
Secret club.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.332
Good morning.

38:59.296 --> 39:03.425
What's the matter?
You're not hungry, sweetheart?

39:08.138 --> 39:11.475
Claire, I thought
you could use a cup of coffee.

39:11.558 --> 39:12.726
Thanks.

39:14.061 --> 39:15.771
- Peyton?
- Yeah?

39:15.854 --> 39:18.607
Have you noticed
anything different about Joe?

39:18.648 --> 39:21.526
No, I haven't.
Why, is something wrong?

39:23.653 --> 39:26.823
No. I was just wondering. I'm real tired.

39:26.907 --> 39:31.286
Michael was up all night finishing
his proposal. I got up at 4:30 to type it.

39:31.370 --> 39:34.414
- I hope it works out.
- Good morning.

39:34.456 --> 39:37.292
- See you tonight.
- You're not gonna have pancakes?

39:37.376 --> 39:39.628
No, I've got to go to Federal Express.

39:40.128 --> 39:43.048
Let me. That's the last thing
you need to worry about.

39:43.256 --> 39:46.009
You have the time?
My proposal has to go out today.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.887
Okay. Thanks. I love you.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.972
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Michael.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.654
How long
have you been volunteering here?

40:05.695 --> 40:07.656
Gee, about seven years.

40:08.323 --> 40:11.743
These days, I just take care
of the morning maintenance.

40:14.663 --> 40:16.581
- Hi, Claire.
- Hi, Stan.

40:17.791 --> 40:20.836
Like a big botanist family down here.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.170
Yup.

40:22.879 --> 40:26.049
We sit around talking about root rot

40:26.133 --> 40:31.513
and drainage properties of shredded
bark and other fascinating topics.

40:35.434 --> 40:38.687
Is your greenhouse
going to be something like this one?

40:38.770 --> 40:42.858
Well, hopefully.
On a much smaller scale though.

40:43.817 --> 40:45.902
I've always loved growing anything.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.988
When I was little,
my parents thought I was crazy.

40:48.989 --> 40:51.950
They thought I should've been born
on a farm.

40:57.664 --> 40:58.707
Hey!

41:02.210 --> 41:03.378
Hello.

41:04.212 --> 41:05.505
Hello!

41:10.260 --> 41:12.053
Do you have relatives in Seattle?

41:12.095 --> 41:13.805
Oh, no, I don't.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.184
My husband was my only family.

41:18.059 --> 41:21.730
He's the only one
who ever really understood me.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.566
He took care of me.

41:28.778 --> 41:30.405
He was murdered.

41:32.491 --> 41:33.867
Murdered?

41:36.328 --> 41:38.580
They never caught who did it.

41:41.416 --> 41:45.462
But I firmly believe
what goes around, comes around.

41:48.882 --> 41:51.760
Is there a bathroom here?

41:51.801 --> 41:54.971
Yeah, down through there
on the right side.

41:55.055 --> 41:56.848
I'll be right back.

43:37.365 --> 43:38.742
Come here, little one.

43:38.867 --> 43:41.286
Do you need to be changed?

44:07.604 --> 44:09.105
Come here.

44:10.732 --> 44:12.609
Michael's proposal.

44:13.193 --> 44:14.402
I can't find it.

44:15.153 --> 44:17.280
It was in your purse.
I saw you put it in there!

44:18.990 --> 44:20.283
Claire, are you all right?

44:21.284 --> 44:24.996
Asthma. I'll be okay.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.464
Asthma.

44:44.933 --> 44:46.935
Michael, it's just disappeared.

44:47.018 --> 44:51.314
I've retraced my steps.
I spoke to the manager in the restaurant.

44:51.398 --> 44:54.317
He said he'd call in the morning.

44:54.401 --> 44:56.820
What did they say
when you called again?

44:56.903 --> 44:59.239
They said they'd consider it
next quarter.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.575
- But they said they'd consider it?
- Claire, come on.

45:02.617 --> 45:04.452
We've been over this.

45:05.286 --> 45:08.164
Look, everything is gonna be okay.

45:09.457 --> 45:12.460
- Michael, I'm so sorry.
- I know you are, honey.

45:12.544 --> 45:14.337
I know you are.

45:15.797 --> 45:20.218
- Maybe I left it at the botanicals...
- I'm going to get back to work.

45:21.636 --> 45:23.012
I'm sorry.

45:45.618 --> 45:47.454
Michael, I'm worried about Joe.

45:47.495 --> 45:49.164
Why? What's wrong?

45:51.166 --> 45:52.959
It's his eating habits.

45:53.209 --> 45:55.628
He's stopped nursing
the way he used to.

45:56.212 --> 45:58.214
How long has this been going on?

45:58.757 --> 46:01.259
It's not all the time. A couple of weeks.

46:01.342 --> 46:03.011
- Did you call the doctor?
- Yeah.

46:03.094 --> 46:04.679
What did she say?

46:04.763 --> 46:07.849
She said it's fine as long
as he keeps gaining weight.

46:08.516 --> 46:11.644
Well, I'm sure he's fine, honey.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.192
Someone named Peyton
is here to see you.

46:17.233 --> 46:19.903
- Peyton's here?
- She's in your office.

46:23.490 --> 46:26.367
She's our nanny, Gilbert.

46:26.409 --> 46:29.662
Okay.
Let me in on where you do your hiring.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.498
Hi.

46:33.208 --> 46:34.876
He's out cold.

46:36.586 --> 46:41.966
Sorry to bother you at the office,
but I wanted to talk to you in private.

46:42.050 --> 46:44.219
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yeah.

46:44.260 --> 46:48.097
I just had an idea.
It's Claire's birthday coming up.

46:48.181 --> 46:52.101
I thought it would be nice
to throw her a surprise party.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.354
She's been feeling low lately.

46:54.604 --> 46:56.731
Especially with this thing
with your proposal.

46:57.732 --> 46:59.359
That's a good idea.

46:59.400 --> 47:00.652
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

47:03.404 --> 47:05.824
Do you think Marlene
would want to help out?

47:06.449 --> 47:10.161
Help out? You kidding me?
She'll take over.

47:12.580 --> 47:15.250
Maybe it's best not to tell her
it was my idea.

47:16.084 --> 47:17.085
Why not?

47:17.418 --> 47:20.046
I wouldn't want her to think
I was competitive.

47:21.089 --> 47:22.799
About Claire's friendship.

47:23.466 --> 47:26.135
You understand Marlene
pretty well already.

47:35.270 --> 47:38.022
Good. So I'll be going.

47:38.106 --> 47:41.276
Okay, good. I'm real glad you came by.

47:46.155 --> 47:47.782
- Bye.
- Bye.

48:46.841 --> 48:48.259
Solomon!

48:51.387 --> 48:53.765
I want to show you my sculpture.

48:59.270 --> 49:00.355
Okay.

49:02.023 --> 49:05.818
Is that the head? Or is that the foot?

49:05.860 --> 49:08.029
No, that's part of the fur.

49:11.908 --> 49:14.160
Okay, I see.

49:14.869 --> 49:17.205
That's a piece of art.

49:17.246 --> 49:19.332
- I knew you'd see it.
- Yeah.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.043
Yeah.

49:23.628 --> 49:26.047
- Hi, Emma.
- Hi, Peyton.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.548
Hi, Solomon.

49:27.632 --> 49:30.551
Emma, go inside.
I've got to talk to Solomon.

49:30.635 --> 49:32.178
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.729
Are you a retard?

49:41.771 --> 49:43.189
No.

49:48.444 --> 49:50.571
Did you like looking at me?

49:56.244 --> 49:58.913
Did you like looking at me?

50:05.586 --> 50:08.256
Don't fuck with me, retard.

50:12.593 --> 50:17.765
My version of the story
will be better than yours.

50:25.565 --> 50:28.067
I won't let you hurt them.

50:28.109 --> 50:30.069
They're my friends.

50:34.282 --> 50:36.409
I won't let you hurt them!

50:41.164 --> 50:42.331
Boy.

50:56.971 --> 50:57.972
Solomon!

51:01.059 --> 51:02.459
Would you step inside for a minute?

51:08.232 --> 51:09.233
Okay.

51:22.497 --> 51:23.956
Surprise!

51:26.501 --> 51:27.835
It's for you, big guy

51:32.048 --> 51:34.425
I was in charge of picking it out.

51:38.554 --> 51:40.223
You're my friends.

51:41.057 --> 51:42.475
Oh, my.

51:46.896 --> 51:49.649
You should've seen his face
when we gave him the bicycle.

51:49.690 --> 51:51.192
Emma adores him.

51:54.529 --> 51:57.490
Claire, there's something
that's been bothering me.

51:57.990 --> 52:00.701
I feel a little awkward bringing it up.

52:02.537 --> 52:07.375
I've been noticing some behavior
that I feel might be inappropriate.

52:08.376 --> 52:10.419
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, "inappropriate"?

52:13.881 --> 52:16.384
Something about the way
he touches her.

52:19.053 --> 52:21.180
I'm sure you must've misunderstood.

52:22.974 --> 52:26.978
You're right. Solomon would
never do anything like that.

52:27.520 --> 52:30.398
It would be obvious
if Emma were keeping a secret.

52:33.484 --> 52:36.654
- I'm sorry.
- No, please. It's okay.

52:42.910 --> 52:44.245
<i>She's coming around.</i>

52:50.042 --> 52:51.919
I love you very much, sweetheart.

52:53.337 --> 52:55.923
You know that if anything happened,

52:56.591 --> 52:58.718
good or bad,

52:58.759 --> 53:01.095
you can tell me
and I would love you just as much.

53:01.846 --> 53:04.265
- Do you know that?
- Yes.

53:06.267 --> 53:08.311
We shouldn't have any secrets.

53:09.770 --> 53:13.274
Secrets between people
who love each other aren't good.

53:15.735 --> 53:17.111
What's the matter, baby?

53:17.904 --> 53:19.238
Nothing.

53:24.452 --> 53:26.370
You don't have to say.

53:41.594 --> 53:44.722
Why can't I see through this glass?

53:44.805 --> 53:47.308
It's fiberglass, a different kind of glass.

53:47.850 --> 53:51.687
We put real glass in the ceiling
to let the sunlight through.

53:55.650 --> 53:59.445
And this lets the air in so it doesn't
get too hot in the greenhouse.

54:02.490 --> 54:04.450
Joe's intercom conked out,

54:04.492 --> 54:06.911
and I couldn't find any batteries
in the kitchen.

54:06.994 --> 54:09.121
Think Solomon's got some in his cart?

54:09.163 --> 54:10.998
Well...

54:11.624 --> 54:14.919
He's got everything else there.
Let me take a look.

56:02.068 --> 56:03.110
Sweetheart?

56:04.111 --> 56:06.572
<i>Come away from the window, honey.</i>

56:10.076 --> 56:11.369
<i>Emma?</i>

56:14.330 --> 56:15.706
Come sit down.

56:27.885 --> 56:29.220
Peyton.

56:40.815 --> 56:42.691
But I don't understand.

56:42.775 --> 56:45.486
Why did they take Solomon away?

56:45.528 --> 56:48.406
I guess your mommy
didn't like Solomon very much.

56:48.739 --> 56:49.990
I wanted to help Solomon,

56:50.074 --> 56:53.119
but I was afraid
she'd send me away, too.

56:54.120 --> 56:55.538
I hate her.

56:56.831 --> 56:59.834
I bet your mommy
wasn't mean like mine.

57:01.168 --> 57:03.087
I didn't have a mommy.

57:05.005 --> 57:07.133
She died when I was very little.

57:07.842 --> 57:09.510
Your mommy died?

57:11.011 --> 57:12.847
Then who took care of you?

57:15.850 --> 57:18.018
I had to take care of myself.

57:19.353 --> 57:23.649
Peyton, if something happens
to my mommy,

57:23.691 --> 57:25.568
would you take care of me?

57:26.444 --> 57:28.821
Of course I would.

57:28.863 --> 57:31.031
And your daddy, too.

57:31.073 --> 57:33.367
I'd take care of all of you.

57:52.052 --> 57:53.804
Last of the boxes.

58:04.064 --> 58:06.567
Emma's going to be okay, Claire.

58:15.409 --> 58:17.953
She's so different around me lately.

58:20.039 --> 58:23.667
She's not my little girl. She's so angry.

58:25.252 --> 58:26.879
And guarded.

58:28.047 --> 58:29.256
I think

58:31.342 --> 58:34.553
maybe she blames me
because I didn't protect her.

58:36.305 --> 58:38.307
I don't think so, Claire.

58:54.114 --> 58:57.743
Marlene wants to get together tonight
to make out a guest list.

58:57.785 --> 59:00.788
I'm not sure this party's
a good idea now.

59:00.871 --> 59:05.084
We should go ahead with it.
Everyone could use some cheering up.

59:05.125 --> 59:09.296
Especially Claire. You know
how she's been blaming herself.

59:09.380 --> 59:12.299
Yeah, I think you're right.

59:13.467 --> 59:15.427
Guess I just needed to hear it.

59:20.683 --> 59:24.520
Thanks for lunch. I liked the part
where we picked up the fertilizer.

59:24.603 --> 59:26.313
- Oh, you liked that?
- Oh, yeah.

59:26.814 --> 59:28.899
Hi, you two.

59:28.983 --> 59:31.235
- Can I take him?
- Oh, sure.

59:31.318 --> 59:34.572
Hi, sweetheart. Hello.

59:35.990 --> 59:38.492
- Let me help.
- He's getting so big.

59:39.159 --> 59:41.203
He's a different kid every time I see him.

59:42.997 --> 59:46.041
He's got a great set of lungs,
doesn't he?

59:46.125 --> 59:49.503
- Oh, what's the matter?
- You want mommy?

59:49.545 --> 59:52.131
- You want to go?
- What happened?

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:03.434
I don't know what got into him today.
Want me to try?

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:06.854
- Wanna go to Peyton?
- It's okay.

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:08.105
Yeah.

01:00:09.315 --> 01:00:11.984
Yeah, it's okay, little one.

01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:20.993
What is that annoying noise?

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:27.041
Wind chimes. A gift from Peyton.

01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:30.836
Charming.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:34.882
Well, I gotta go.

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:38.594
- Bye-bye. Thanks for lunch.
- Okay.

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:47.853
Marlene,

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.230
Peyton's making
one of her famous souffles.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.107
Why don't you and Marty
stop by for dessert?

01:00:53.067 --> 01:00:55.569
I'm showing the Fletcher house tonight.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.636
Didn't you sell the Fletcher house?

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:01.825
Actually I did,
but the financing fell through.

01:01:01.909 --> 01:01:04.662
I have to start all over.
Bye. I'll call you.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:06.121
Okay.

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:15.547
That smells great.

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:19.593
You know what they say.
Chocolate's a substitute for sex.

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:22.763
Chocolate's great,
but I don't know about that.

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:28.894
Guess you and Michael keep
those fires burning all the time, huh?

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:33.357
Well, we certainly
have enjoyed each other.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:37.403
When we first moved into this house,

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:39.780
we christened every room.

01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:41.532
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:49.832
Well, you know.

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:57.005
When you have a baby, you start to feel
tired and unattractive and fat.

01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:02.803
I'm sure Michael is as attracted to you
now as he ever was.

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:05.597
A man never loses it for his first love.

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.143
But I wasn't Michael's first love.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.436
No?

01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:12.938
You'll never guess who was.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:16.608
Marlene?

01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:19.194
Am I right?

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.989
Yeah, how'd you know that?

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.159
Wild guess.

01:02:26.285 --> 01:02:29.663
You know, it's a shame
Michael's not here. He's gonna miss it.

01:02:30.122 --> 01:02:32.750
What's he doing so late
at the lab anyway?

01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:36.837
That's a good question.
I'm gonna give him a call.

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:45.262
- Randy and Cecie.
- Dave and Loreeta.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:48.766
- And Mitch.
- Mitch and the Harrisons.

01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:51.518
- Oh, come on.
- They always invite us.

01:02:56.315 --> 01:02:57.399
You got a light?

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:04.198
Can't find my lighter.
Marty's gonna throw a fit.

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:16.543
You know, I'm still not sold
on this whole surprise party thing.

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:20.339
- Because of Emma?
- And Claire.

01:03:21.799 --> 01:03:23.717
She just hasn't been herself lately.

01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:27.387
How's Peyton doing?

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:30.808
Boy, Peyton's been great.

01:03:31.642 --> 01:03:32.893
Has she?

01:03:32.935 --> 01:03:35.187
I don't know what we would have done
without her.

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:46.949
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:52.746
- How was your night?
- Fine.

01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:57.125
Yeah?

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:03.215
Michael, I called the lab.
There was no answer.

01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:05.342
I was in a room without a phone.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.014
Honey, come on.

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:14.309
I didn't mean to frighten you.

01:04:14.393 --> 01:04:18.230
- You been smoking?
- No, I haven't been smoking.

01:04:18.272 --> 01:04:19.982
One of the techs was.
Must be in my hair.

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:22.776
Michael, you never let
anybody smoke at the lab.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.695
What is this, an interrogation?

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:27.197
- Well?
- Well, what?

01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:31.159
It's been a long day.
I just wanna go to bed.

01:05:17.623 --> 01:05:19.124
I heard something.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.793
I dropped something.

01:05:26.757 --> 01:05:28.634
Well, good night.

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:32.346
Can I fix you something?

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:37.476
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:42.105
I'm sure.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.151
Good night.

01:06:03.794 --> 01:06:05.879
Your mom and I want to talk to you.

01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:09.424
The Better Way Society
is putting Solomon back to work.

01:06:09.508 --> 01:06:13.720
- Better Day!
- Better Day, sorry.

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:18.225
Your mom and I want you to let us know
if you see him

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.769
around school or at the house.

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:23.855
You don't have to be afraid.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:26.316
I'm not afraid of Solomon.

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:31.530
Peyton! Wait for me!

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.073
Peyton!

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.804
- Mrs. Bartel.
- Hi, Joe.

01:06:57.139 --> 01:06:58.932
Let's see. Three pants,

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:01.476
a dress, one shirt. Like starch?

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:04.688
Yeah, and this jacket here
kind of smells of cigarette.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:07.249
I didn't know
your husband was a smoker.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:08.942
He's not.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:11.445
What's this?

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:16.158
Mrs. Bartel, your husband's
got a habit he's keeping from you.

01:07:45.854 --> 01:07:47.439
Mommy, what's wrong?

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:13.131
Mom, let's go inside.

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:16.926
Go upstairs to your room and play.

01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:18.470
But, Mom...

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.973
Emma, please! Go upstairs.

01:08:41.827 --> 01:08:43.328
Claire?

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:46.288
Honey, what's the matter?

01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:48.457
Michael.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.545
How could you do this?

01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:55.381
- What are you talking about?
- You've been lying to me.

01:08:57.384 --> 01:08:59.594
- Honey, calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down,

01:08:59.678 --> 01:09:01.429
you son of a bitch.

01:09:04.933 --> 01:09:06.309
You don't understand.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.812
I understand
you've been fucking Marlene.

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.729
All right, Claire, that's enough!

01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:14.067
There are people in there.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.283
What are you talking about?

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:24.743
- Talking about a surprise party.
- Oh, my God.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.747
Everybody's in there.

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:57.235
Surprise.

01:09:57.277 --> 01:09:58.278
Surprise.

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:38.568
Did you speak to Marlene yet?

01:10:38.652 --> 01:10:39.861
No.

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:43.949
I can't seem to face her.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:50.413
Michael, I can't go on like this anymore.

01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:54.542
I can't say I'm sorry
any more than I already have.

01:11:03.343 --> 01:11:06.096
I can't go on like this anymore either.

01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:10.684
<i>I was thinking,</i>

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:13.853
<i>maybe we could go away
for a few days.</i>

01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:18.483
<i>You mean,
Peyton and the kids, or just us?</i>

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:23.697
<i>No, I was thinking
just the family without Peyton.</i>

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.740
<i>You like having Peyton around.</i>

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:29.744
<i>I do, and then sometimes I don't.</i>

01:11:29.828 --> 01:11:31.371
<i>You sound like you're turning on her.</i>

01:11:33.081 --> 01:11:34.666
It's just... You know.

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:38.753
So many things have gone wrong
since she's been here.

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.298
You saying those things
are Peyton's fault?

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:42.674
No.

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:45.176
I don't know.

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:47.262
I just don't feel like myself.

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:50.724
<i>Claire, honey, come on.</i>

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:53.268
<i>Peyton's come through
in some very tough times.</i>

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:57.063
<i>I know.
We'll talk about it when we go</i> away.

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:59.733
<i>We'll go away, just the family.</i>

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:54.305
If there are any further services
that I might provide,

01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:57.851
do not hesitate to call, blah, blah, blah.

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:01.521
These are all in the Magnolia District
in that price range.

01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:05.442
Eastwind, Hobart. These are old.

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:08.862
They still haven't unloaded
the good doctor's house.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:11.573
Waiting for a tip?

01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:30.925
- Cancel my morning.
- What should I tell Lambert?

01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:33.553
Make something up.
You've got a Harvard education.

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:46.107
Hi, sweetheart. I'll be back in a while.

01:14:46.566 --> 01:14:48.401
You're not working here?

01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:52.197
No, I have to go to the botanicals
to pick up seedlings. I won't be long.

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:29.067
Fucking A.

01:15:40.787 --> 01:15:41.788
Hello?

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:43.498
Let me speak to Claire.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.124
May I ask who's calling?

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.502
Marlene Craven. Want me to spell it?

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:51.172
Claire's not here.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:53.383
<i>- I'll tell her you called.</i>
- Sure you will.

01:15:58.221 --> 01:16:00.598
What is this, a parade? Let's go!

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:20.451
Claire, I didn't know you were here.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:23.204
Marlene called, said it's important.

01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:24.998
Oh, okay, thanks.

01:16:54.402 --> 01:16:55.945
Hello, Marlene.

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:01.993
Claire! It's Marlene! Claire!

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:05.455
- Marlene, is everything all right?
- No.

01:17:06.039 --> 01:17:09.417
I need a doctor. Know of any, Mrs. Mott?

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:13.296
Where's Claire?

01:17:18.176 --> 01:17:21.095
Marlene, please?

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:22.555
Where is she?

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:26.392
She's in the greenhouse.

01:17:27.935 --> 01:17:31.064
But, please, Marlene,
please don't go out there.

01:17:32.774 --> 01:17:36.277
Claire! This is important!

01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:38.613
It has nothing to do with the party!

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:40.239
Claire!

01:17:41.616 --> 01:17:42.909
Claire!

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:58.461
This little piggy stayed home.

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:00.838
This little piggy had roast beef.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.882
This little piggy had none.

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:54.934
<i>911 emergency.</i>

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:02.395
Here's the O2.

01:23:04.105 --> 01:23:06.148
This isn't going to work.

01:23:06.232 --> 01:23:09.276
Get me my laryngoscope
and a number five line right away.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:13.406
- What happened?
- Paramedics are with her now.

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:15.199
What happened?

01:23:15.241 --> 01:23:20.079
Everything's gonna be fine.
She's a friend? It's gonna be okay.

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:23.749
She has trouble breathing.
She has asthma.

01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:27.003
The paramedics
have everything under control.

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:30.631
Hey, Al.

01:23:31.757 --> 01:23:33.592
Take a look over here.

01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:54.613
It's okay, Joe. It's okay.

01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:05.166
Claire, honey? Can you hear me?

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.628
You're safe now. You're in a hospital.

01:24:12.298 --> 01:24:14.258
Just try and rest, okay?

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.438
Michael.

01:25:12.024 --> 01:25:14.193
I keep seeing Marlene's face.

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:18.197
I can't believe she's gone.

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:24.787
Come inside.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.043
That's better.

01:25:33.212 --> 01:25:34.713
You're soaked.

01:25:35.881 --> 01:25:37.049
Soaked through.

01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:50.938
Peyton.

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.487
There's only one woman for me.

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:05.870
That's all you need.

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:23.345
Thanks.

01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:27.641
Thank you very much.

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:36.775
- You okay?
- Fine.

01:26:37.443 --> 01:26:38.569
Emma?

01:26:40.112 --> 01:26:42.615
Fasten your seat belt, sweetheart.

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:05.387
I got it.

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:14.521
- Hi, Peyton.
- Hi, Emma.

01:27:17.358 --> 01:27:20.569
Hello, Claire,
it's good to have you home.

01:27:20.653 --> 01:27:22.363
It's good to be home.

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:25.115
Michael, the school secretary called.

01:27:25.366 --> 01:27:28.118
The meeting is Thursday.
I wrote it in your book.

01:27:28.327 --> 01:27:32.206
Okay, great, thanks. It's a fund-raiser.

01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:34.465
Peyton heard about it
when she picked up Emma.

01:27:38.504 --> 01:27:40.589
You said I could borrow it.
Is it all right?

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.510
Yeah.

01:27:45.803 --> 01:27:48.681
I'll be right back.
I don't want to burn dinner.

01:27:49.682 --> 01:27:51.850
It's great to have you back.

01:28:02.695 --> 01:28:05.030
You like it? Peyton did it.

01:28:07.116 --> 01:28:09.159
Someone could have asked me first.

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:11.203
We thought it would be a surprise.

01:28:11.287 --> 01:28:12.871
We thought you might like it.

01:28:14.581 --> 01:28:16.221
If you don't, I'll have her take it down.

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:18.460
It's okay.

01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:22.006
All right, well, I'll put your things away.

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:39.773
All right, do you have any sevens?

01:28:39.857 --> 01:28:40.858
Go fish.

01:28:42.776 --> 01:28:44.987
Look what I took, huh?

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.157
Do you have a ten?

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.992
Go fish!

01:28:54.538 --> 01:28:57.249
Keep your cards up here
so Peyton can't see them.

01:28:57.291 --> 01:28:59.209
So you can't see them.

01:29:21.482 --> 01:29:24.276
Yeah, that's it.

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.653
There we go.

01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:34.244
Did she tell you
where she was going in such a hurry?

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:37.790
No, she just took off.
Told me to cancel her morning.

01:29:48.634 --> 01:29:51.095
What was she doing before she left?

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:54.598
I had just given her these listings
she had asked for.

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.519
She looked at them.
A minute later, she hurried out of here.

01:29:58.602 --> 01:30:01.939
- Listings? These?
- Those are the ones.

01:30:51.447 --> 01:30:52.865
Mrs. Harris?

01:30:55.242 --> 01:30:56.285
I'm glad you made it.

01:30:57.119 --> 01:30:59.746
Bruce Silverman, Windemere Realty.

01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:04.251
- Would you care to take a look inside?
- Yeah.

01:31:10.299 --> 01:31:12.885
I'm glad you made it.
I was just on my way out.

01:31:23.395 --> 01:31:26.231
The house was custom-built
three years ago.

01:31:27.316 --> 01:31:29.902
It's listed well below market value.

01:31:31.695 --> 01:31:33.614
They're very motivated.

01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:39.578
- May I?
- Of course.

01:31:42.498 --> 01:31:45.834
The original owners
lived here a very short time.

01:31:45.918 --> 01:31:47.794
New carpet throughout.

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:51.089
There is a nursery?

01:31:53.467 --> 01:31:55.385
Perfect room for kids.

01:32:05.103 --> 01:32:08.106
That's a strange-looking toy. What is it?

01:32:10.817 --> 01:32:13.111
It's a breast pump.

01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:14.655
Breast pump?

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:19.785
She used it to keep her milk up.

01:32:36.927 --> 01:32:38.679
I don't understand where she could be.

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:39.930
I don't either.

01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:47.437
Here she is.

01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:55.320
- Where have you been?
- Michael, I've got...

01:33:01.952 --> 01:33:03.662
Claire, we were worried about you.

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.758
- Claire, my God!
- She's Dr. Mott's widow, Michael.

01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:19.011
She's what?

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:22.139
Get out of our house.

01:33:23.181 --> 01:33:25.892
She's turning on me,
just like you said she would.

01:33:25.976 --> 01:33:29.605
She doesn't realize
how I've come through for this family.

01:33:31.356 --> 01:33:33.859
You have to tell her, tell her about us.

01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:36.570
There's nothing to tell.

01:33:37.237 --> 01:33:38.405
You should leave.

01:33:39.573 --> 01:33:41.700
Michael, what are you saying?

01:33:42.326 --> 01:33:44.953
You told me
there was only one woman for you.

01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:48.624
I meant Claire, my wife.

01:33:53.003 --> 01:33:55.047
Okay, fine.

01:33:57.841 --> 01:34:00.093
I'll just get my baby
and we'll be on our way.

01:34:04.723 --> 01:34:07.726
I meant, I'll just go get my things.

01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:10.395
Michael.

01:34:12.105 --> 01:34:14.232
You don't understand.

01:34:14.316 --> 01:34:15.442
I mean, leave now.

01:34:16.026 --> 01:34:18.070
We'll send your things.

01:34:18.111 --> 01:34:20.530
You're right, Michael. That's best.

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:34.002
The keys.

01:34:36.922 --> 01:34:37.923
Of course.

01:34:41.093 --> 01:34:43.929
I'm sorry. You've been so kind.

01:34:44.971 --> 01:34:47.391
- Mommy, Daddy, what's happening?
- Emma, stay there!

01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:49.893
It's okay, Emma.

01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:52.771
Mommy and Daddy want me to leave.

01:34:53.188 --> 01:34:54.856
Goodbye, Peyton.

01:34:57.734 --> 01:34:59.027
Peyton!

01:35:09.413 --> 01:35:11.957
- Call the police!
- Claire, calm down.

01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:14.668
You don't know what she's capable of!

01:35:15.085 --> 01:35:16.169
We have her keys!

01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:19.256
I think she rigged the greenhouse
for me!

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:22.968
Get the kids' things.

01:35:23.135 --> 01:35:24.302
We'll go to a hotel.

01:35:24.344 --> 01:35:26.304
Go upstairs, sweetheart.

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:30.892
Can you get someone
over here right away?

01:35:30.976 --> 01:35:33.812
<i>It's not an emergency situation.</i>

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:35.355
Well, no.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.692
<i>I'll have a car there as soon as I can.</i>

01:35:38.817 --> 01:35:40.777
All right, we live at 808 Yakima.

01:35:41.695 --> 01:35:45.407
Emma, sweetheart, we're gonna go
away for a few days, okay?

01:35:46.658 --> 01:35:47.826
Bring dolly with you.

01:36:26.156 --> 01:36:27.365
Peyton?

01:36:35.999 --> 01:36:37.292
Peyton?

01:37:26.508 --> 01:37:27.926
Michael?

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.095
Daddy?

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:46.194
Emma, I want you to lock
this door behind me.

01:37:46.444 --> 01:37:49.114
- Don't open it until I come back.
- Yeah.

01:37:50.574 --> 01:37:51.992
Stay here.

01:38:07.465 --> 01:38:08.675
Michael?

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.801
Claire.

01:38:56.222 --> 01:38:58.558
- Michael.
- I'm okay.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.352
She's in the house.

01:39:06.441 --> 01:39:09.527
I can't move. My legs are broken.

01:39:10.195 --> 01:39:12.906
- I'll get the kids.
- Call the police.

01:39:32.133 --> 01:39:33.510
Mommy?

01:39:50.276 --> 01:39:51.903
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

01:39:51.987 --> 01:39:53.905
Hello, yeah.

01:39:54.364 --> 01:39:56.992
We need help at 808 North Yakima.

01:39:57.742 --> 01:39:58.910
Mommy!

01:40:08.128 --> 01:40:09.337
My family!

01:40:16.428 --> 01:40:18.179
It's my family.

01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:33.445
It's okay, Emma.

01:40:34.112 --> 01:40:35.655
Mommy's here.

01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:42.287
I'm gonna take you and Joe.
We're gonna have a real family.

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:44.205
You never have to see
those people again.

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:49.169
So tell your mommy, where's Joe?

01:40:51.963 --> 01:40:52.964
Where is he?

01:40:55.175 --> 01:40:56.342
He's in there.

01:41:06.311 --> 01:41:07.979
You're not my mommy!

01:41:14.152 --> 01:41:15.153
Emma!

01:41:45.767 --> 01:41:46.851
Quiet.

01:41:57.529 --> 01:41:58.696
<i>Emma!</i>

01:41:59.781 --> 01:42:01.157
Emma!

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.375
Emma.

01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:13.419
You're being very bad, Emma.

01:43:04.095 --> 01:43:05.388
You.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.520
- You give him over.
- No!

01:43:12.604 --> 01:43:14.397
- No?
- No!

01:43:14.647 --> 01:43:17.317
You give me my baby
or I'll bash your skull in!

01:43:17.442 --> 01:43:18.526
Peyton!

01:43:23.781 --> 01:43:25.617
It's my family, Peyton.

01:43:38.338 --> 01:43:40.298
Don't hurt my mommy!

01:43:56.314 --> 01:43:57.649
Something the matter, Claire?

01:44:04.656 --> 01:44:08.743
When your husband makes love to you,
it's my face he sees.

01:44:11.329 --> 01:44:15.291
When your baby's hungry,
it's my breast that feeds him.

01:44:16.834 --> 01:44:18.211
Look at you.

01:44:18.836 --> 01:44:20.838
When push comes to shove,

01:44:23.299 --> 01:44:25.218
you can't even breathe.

01:44:36.604 --> 01:44:38.398
- Now, give him to me.
- No!

01:44:58.876 --> 01:44:59.877
No!

01:45:04.424 --> 01:45:05.466
No!

01:45:35.872 --> 01:45:37.248
Solomon.

01:45:38.124 --> 01:45:41.836
He's okay. I didn't hurt him.

01:45:42.086 --> 01:45:43.963
- I know, I know.
- Okay?

01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:50.136
Emma! Emma, it's okay.

01:45:50.595 --> 01:45:53.431
Come on, come on, up we go.

01:45:55.266 --> 01:45:56.601
Mommy!

01:46:04.317 --> 01:46:06.569
Let's go down to Daddy, okay?

01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:12.784
Solomon, I need you
to do something for me.

01:46:12.867 --> 01:46:14.786
I need you to take Joey downstairs.

01:46:16.454 --> 01:46:20.249
No, I'm not supposed
to handle the baby.

01:46:22.293 --> 01:46:23.544
That's okay.

01:46:24.295 --> 01:46:26.130
I trust you, Solomon.

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:33.805
It's okay?

01:46:35.348 --> 01:46:37.892
Okay? Yeah.

01:46:39.644 --> 01:46:42.647
Boy. There you are.

01:46:44.273 --> 01:46:45.274
Come on, sweetheart.

01:46:45.983 --> 01:46:49.695
- Let's go and get Daddy.
- Oh, my, little baby.

01:46:51.697 --> 01:46:52.698
Solomon?

01:46:54.367 --> 01:46:55.743
Come on.
