00:28.467 --> 00:31.136
Hey. Excuse me. I'm Paul Capra.
I'm here to see Christina.

00:31.137 --> 00:34.098
Oh, right this way, Mr.
Capra. She's expecting you.

00:40.771 --> 00:42.523
- Paul.
- Hey, Christina.

00:42.524 --> 00:45.443
Hi. It's good to see you.

00:45.444 --> 00:47.069
- Yeah, you too.
- Can I get you anything?

00:47.070 --> 00:48.737
Nah. I grabbed some
breakfast on the way down.

00:48.738 --> 00:50.989
- Okay. Have a seat.
- All right. Thank you.

00:56.285 --> 01:00.247
I asked you down here because
I spoke to D-Trip and the D.N.C.

01:00.248 --> 01:02.249
We'd like you to run for Peter's seat.

01:02.250 --> 01:03.876
As you probably know,

01:03.877 --> 01:06.920
the election's been set for
the first week of February.

01:06.921 --> 01:08.589
You want me to run?

01:08.590 --> 01:10.090
With your stature in the community,

01:10.091 --> 01:11.842
your grass roots organizing experience...

01:11.843 --> 01:13.302
Christina, hold on.

01:13.303 --> 01:14.761
I know it's a lot to consider.

01:14.762 --> 01:16.096
It's only been a month.

01:16.097 --> 01:18.265
Well, we still have to govern, Paul.

01:18.266 --> 01:19.684
I thought you asked me down here

01:19.685 --> 01:22.061
because you wanted to talk or something.

01:22.062 --> 01:24.021
I do. About the election.

01:24.022 --> 01:27.400
I mean about Peter.

01:27.401 --> 01:31.237
How come you didn't go to the funeral?

01:31.238 --> 01:33.989
I couldn't.

01:33.990 --> 01:35.908
How you been holding up?

01:35.909 --> 01:39.203
I'm all right. It's been hard
keeping the office on track.

01:39.204 --> 01:41.205
Jesus. Screw the office.

01:41.206 --> 01:42.665
What about you?

01:42.666 --> 01:45.543
You're allowed to grieve, Christina.

01:45.544 --> 01:47.587
Paul...

01:47.588 --> 01:50.548
there are 600,000 people counting on us.

01:50.549 --> 01:54.051
I can't let my feelings
get in the way of that.

01:54.052 --> 01:56.970
Will you hear me out about
running for Peter's seat?

03:59.558 --> 04:03.229
Well, you've passed the vetting
process with flying colors.

04:03.230 --> 04:05.772
- Is there anything we might have missed?
- No, sir.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.318
Tell me about your experience

04:09.319 --> 04:11.904
as the chair of the
oversight reform committee.

04:11.905 --> 04:16.116
It's been very rewarding.

04:19.036 --> 04:21.829
What are the biggest
challenges you've had to face?

04:21.831 --> 04:24.166
Partisanship.

04:31.882 --> 04:34.968
Well, I suppose a room
filled with 435 big egos

04:34.969 --> 04:38.055
isn't the most hospitable
place for oversight.

04:46.772 --> 04:49.400
Do you want to be Vice President, Tabitha?

04:49.401 --> 04:52.528
It would be a great honor, sir.

04:59.618 --> 05:01.661
We'll be in touch.

05:01.662 --> 05:03.956
- That's all?
- Mm-hmm.

05:03.957 --> 05:06.792
- For the time being.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

05:10.171 --> 05:12.381
We have to cross her off.

05:12.382 --> 05:14.425
I agree. She could put
a crack addict to sleep.

05:14.426 --> 05:16.676
Then what is she doing on the goddamn list?

05:16.677 --> 05:18.596
Tabitha's a very gifted legislator.

05:18.597 --> 05:20.639
I don't want people
who make sense on paper.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.601
I need at least one viable option.

05:23.602 --> 05:27.313
The two of you created this list and have
proceeded to cross off every name you've put on it.

05:27.314 --> 05:29.856
It's just a first pass, sir.
We need time to fully vet all...

05:29.857 --> 05:31.942
Jim is gonna win this thing in
Pennsylvania, and we're no closer

05:31.943 --> 05:34.236
to naming his replacement
than we were a month ago.

05:34.237 --> 05:37.781
Let us take another crack at it and
give you a few more names to consider.

05:37.782 --> 05:41.160
- I just want one name.
- We'll have something for you by tomorrow morning.

05:41.161 --> 05:43.287
Thank you, Mr. President.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.876
He's ready to say yes to anything.

05:49.877 --> 05:52.546
Yeah, for this to work, I don't think you
can be there. Not when I first mention it.

05:52.547 --> 05:53.964
I agree. You bring it
up in your morning brief,

05:53.965 --> 05:55.715
and when I show up, I'll act surprised.

05:55.716 --> 05:57.468
Assuming he's open to the idea.

05:57.469 --> 05:59.386
Look, all we have to do tomorrow
is plant the notion in his head.

05:59.387 --> 06:01.972
I'm sure you'll be persuasive.

06:01.973 --> 06:03.974
Hello?

06:03.975 --> 06:06.268
- Mr. Capra?
- Yeah. Who's this?

06:06.269 --> 06:08.312
Janine Skorsky from Slugline.

06:08.313 --> 06:09.605
We spoke when I wrote the piece

06:09.606 --> 06:11.315
about Congressman Russo's passing.

06:11.316 --> 06:13.900
I'm done giving interviews
about Peter, okay?

06:13.901 --> 06:16.736
He was a troubled guy. End of story.

06:16.737 --> 06:18.489
This is not about his death.

06:18.490 --> 06:22.535
I'm calling you because my
sources at the D Triple C

06:22.536 --> 06:25.329
are telling me that you
might be running for his seat.

06:25.330 --> 06:26.788
I'm not talking about that.

06:26.789 --> 06:28.415
But you did have a meeting this morning

06:28.416 --> 06:30.459
with Christina Gallagher, correct?

06:30.460 --> 06:32.794
I'm driving right now. I really
shouldn't be on the phone.

06:32.795 --> 06:36.507
If you do run, I would like
to know about your involvement

06:36.508 --> 06:39.468
in the closing of the
Philadelphia shipyard.

06:39.469 --> 06:42.137
That decision was made in Washington.

06:42.138 --> 06:45.015
The association wasn't consulted.

06:45.016 --> 06:47.809
Forgive me. I find that hard to believe.

06:47.810 --> 06:51.397
I read all of the transcripts
from the brac commission.

06:51.398 --> 06:53.899
Congressman Russo didn't
give any testimony.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.985
So are you saying that he didn't
consult with you once before you...

06:56.986 --> 06:59.613
somebody was strong-arming
him, okay? It was politics.

06:59.614 --> 07:01.907
Do you know who would've pressured him?

07:01.908 --> 07:04.243
Look, I don't know. He just
said people up the food chain.

07:04.244 --> 07:06.453
Did he say anything more specific about...

07:06.454 --> 07:08.706
you know what? There's traffic. I gotta go.

07:08.707 --> 07:12.084
Mr. Capra, I would... 

07:22.344 --> 07:24.346
Should I be prepared to do press?

07:24.347 --> 07:27.349
If he's amenable.

07:27.350 --> 07:29.851
What do you think our chances are?

07:31.144 --> 07:35.023
Better than 50-50, if I had to say.

07:35.024 --> 07:38.360
We won't announce until
after Matthews wins, though.

07:39.612 --> 07:41.739
I hate to admit it, but I'm nervous.

07:41.740 --> 07:43.282
So am I.

07:43.283 --> 07:45.409
It's just the last time,
we found ourselves...

07:45.410 --> 07:47.953
that's my fear too.

07:47.954 --> 07:50.872
All right. You call me, either way.

07:54.628 --> 07:57.254
In no more than nine hours.

08:10.058 --> 08:12.185
Linda's been in there far too long.

08:12.186 --> 08:15.188
If the President takes this much
convincing, it doesn't bode well.

08:15.189 --> 08:19.151
I can feel it... his hesitation
on the other side of that door.

08:19.152 --> 08:22.446
I know it's pointless to worry
until I know what cards I'm holding.

08:22.447 --> 08:25.365
Perhaps he just got interrupted by some...

08:25.366 --> 08:28.285
He wants to tap Raymond Tusk.

08:29.495 --> 08:31.913
- What?
- He thinks it's a bold idea.

08:31.914 --> 08:34.582
It's an idiotic idea. The
man's never held public office.

08:34.583 --> 08:37.251
That's one of the things the
President said he likes about him.

08:37.253 --> 08:41.173
The President wants to nominate a
multibillionaire in a struggling economy?

08:41.174 --> 08:43.717
- He'll alienate half the country.
- Which is exactly what I said,

08:43.717 --> 08:47.220
but he made it very clear he does
not want me to fight him on this.

08:47.221 --> 08:49.431
- So you didn't mention me at all?
- I never had the chance.

08:49.432 --> 08:51.809
His mind was made up
before I could say a word.

08:51.810 --> 08:53.268
Well, we have to unmake it.

08:53.269 --> 08:55.354
Well, you can try, but if you do,

08:55.355 --> 08:58.190
my guess is he's gonna cut you
out of the process altogether.

08:58.191 --> 09:00.025
He seemed adamant.

09:00.026 --> 09:02.110
We should go in there.

09:08.826 --> 09:11.537
- Mr. President.
- Morning, Frank.

09:11.538 --> 09:14.039
Will you give us a few minutes, Linda?

09:14.040 --> 09:16.124
Of course.

09:19.838 --> 09:22.130
Linda fill you in?

09:25.634 --> 09:29.555
I think Raymond Tusk

09:29.556 --> 09:34.017
is an exciting, bold idea.

09:34.018 --> 09:37.187
Well, I'm glad you agree.
Linda didn't think so.

09:37.188 --> 09:39.815
He's a proven businessman.
Brilliant, but down-to-earth.

09:39.816 --> 09:41.149
Do you know him personally?

09:41.150 --> 09:43.485
I met him briefly once at a fund-raiser.

09:43.486 --> 09:46.071
Last night when I called him was the first
time we had a meaningful conversation.

09:46.072 --> 09:48.281
Did he seem open to the idea?

09:48.282 --> 09:49.783
I sensed a good deal of reluctance.

09:49.784 --> 09:51.451
He wanted a few days to consider.

09:51.452 --> 09:53.746
Well, good. That gives us
time to start vetting him.

09:53.747 --> 09:55.873
He's clean. I had him vetted last year

09:55.874 --> 09:59.084
when I was considering him
for secretary of the treasury.

09:59.085 --> 10:01.086
And did he say why he's reluctant?

10:01.087 --> 10:04.130
No. Didn't give a reason.
Just wanted to mull it over.

10:06.049 --> 10:10.220
I want to send someone to St.
Louis to speak to him in person,

10:10.221 --> 10:12.472
convince him to accept the nomination.

10:12.473 --> 10:14.307
And who are you thinking about?

10:14.308 --> 10:17.018
I'd send Linda, but there's so
much work for her to do here,

10:17.019 --> 10:19.855
and, well, she can be abrasive at times.

10:19.856 --> 10:22.399
Yeah, she can be a bit tough.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.985
I want someone with gravitas.

10:25.986 --> 10:29.615
Birch is a possibility, but he's
not always been our strongest ally.

10:29.616 --> 10:33.702
I'm not sure I would trust
Bob with something like this.

10:33.703 --> 10:36.329
I would be happy to go myself, sir.

10:38.331 --> 10:41.877
I can use a light touch and
give him the respect he deserves.

10:41.878 --> 10:45.422
Good. I'll let his
people know you're coming.

10:45.423 --> 10:47.800
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Frank.

10:51.930 --> 10:53.513
Tell me, Francis.

10:53.514 --> 10:55.808
It's good we were prepared for anything.

10:55.809 --> 10:58.351
I have to fly to St. Louis tonight.

10:58.352 --> 11:00.395
"Somebody was strong-arming him,"

11:00.396 --> 11:02.314
and when I asked him who, he said, quote,

11:02.315 --> 11:04.566
- "people up the food chain."
- It's Washington.

11:04.567 --> 11:07.152
Congressmen get strong-armed all the time.

11:07.153 --> 11:09.863
My gut says it was Frank Underwood.

11:09.864 --> 11:12.365
He had nothing to do with Russo
before the shipyard closing,

11:12.366 --> 11:14.075
and then suddenly he's propping him up?

11:14.076 --> 11:15.577
That doesn't mean he was...

11:15.578 --> 11:17.871
Let's cut the bullshit
once and for all, Zoe.

11:17.872 --> 11:19.997
I know he's been feeding you your stories.

11:19.998 --> 11:23.627
I don't want to screw you over, but
I'm not gonna stop digging on this.

11:23.628 --> 11:25.504
I won't say he was a source.

11:25.505 --> 11:27.255
But you do know each other.

11:28.590 --> 11:32.177
Show me your notes, and I'll talk to him.

11:32.178 --> 11:35.138
These are the notes from the Capra call.

11:35.139 --> 11:37.474
And these are the transcripts
from the brac hearing.

11:37.475 --> 11:41.561
When they got to the Philadelphia
shipyard, Russo doesn't say anything.

11:43.647 --> 11:45.273
That's fine.

11:45.274 --> 11:48.610
Yeah, I would just put
both of them in that file.

11:48.611 --> 11:51.488
Claire, I just got a call
from the P.R. office at Sancorp

11:51.489 --> 11:53.699
saying they wanted to send
a film crew to take footage

11:53.700 --> 11:55.492
of our filtration project in Botswana.

11:55.493 --> 11:59.621
Right. They're just using
that for promotional material.

12:00.873 --> 12:03.000
Sancorp fought us on the watershed bill.

12:03.001 --> 12:05.794
They helped us get the
filters out of South Sudan.

12:05.795 --> 12:07.420
I thought that was the state department.

12:07.421 --> 12:10.047
No. You remember Remy Danton?

12:10.048 --> 12:11.424
You met him in your office

12:11.425 --> 12:13.552
right after you started working here.

12:13.553 --> 12:15.888
- The lobbyist.
- I asked him for his help.

12:15.889 --> 12:19.016
We're just returning the favor, that's all.

12:21.184 --> 12:25.355
Claire, they're against
everything we stand for.

12:25.356 --> 12:27.774
It's harmless. They'll send the video

12:27.775 --> 12:30.443
to a few of their investors
and make some commercials.

12:30.444 --> 12:32.487
This makes me very
uncomfortable... the idea...

12:32.488 --> 12:34.781
they are sending the film crew, Gillian,

12:34.782 --> 12:37.367
so please work with them on that.

12:47.711 --> 12:50.797
One of my colleagues is
looking into Peter Russo.

12:50.798 --> 12:55.052
The assumption is you strong-armed
him into closing the shipyard.

12:55.053 --> 12:57.554
Where does your colleague
get their information?

12:57.555 --> 12:59.389
I don't know.

12:59.390 --> 13:02.809
Allocating the D.O.D. budget
is always a free-for-all.

13:02.810 --> 13:04.394
Did you pressure him?

13:04.395 --> 13:06.021
There were certain people
that were gonna benefit

13:06.022 --> 13:07.689
from the base closing
sooner rather than later.

13:07.690 --> 13:09.399
I didn't strong-arm Peter.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.694
I advised him to trade in a
losing hand for a winning one.

13:12.695 --> 13:14.320
How did he stand to win?

13:14.321 --> 13:16.573
He made allies out of enemies.

13:16.574 --> 13:18.408
That's a very valuable thing in Congress.

13:18.409 --> 13:20.159
I wish I could give you something juicier,

13:20.160 --> 13:23.371
but the shipyard closing
was just politics as usual.

13:23.372 --> 13:27.084
I assume your colleague is Ms. Skorsky.

13:28.334 --> 13:30.378
Does she know we're talking?

13:30.379 --> 13:32.965
No. Of course not.

13:32.966 --> 13:35.050
Be in touch.

13:38.177 --> 13:41.556
More than you ever wanted to
know about Raymond Alan Tusk...

13:41.557 --> 13:45.102
the companies he controls,
political contributions.

13:45.103 --> 13:47.687
A GQ article entitled
"Backwoods billionaire"

13:47.688 --> 13:49.689
is about his humble midwestern lifestyle.

13:49.690 --> 13:51.817
- Jesus.
- There's also a copy

13:51.818 --> 13:54.903
of the financial disclosure requirements
and details of the blind trust.

13:54.904 --> 13:57.990
I think the trust is
where you want to focus.

13:57.991 --> 13:59.950
Could Linda be behind all this?

13:59.951 --> 14:01.493
To what end?

14:01.494 --> 14:03.495
To get you out of town for a few days

14:03.496 --> 14:05.664
while they continue the search
without your interference.

14:05.665 --> 14:08.041
The President has no reason to mistrust me.

14:08.042 --> 14:10.502
Unless Linda told him you
want the vice presidency.

14:10.503 --> 14:12.879
No. She's in way too deep.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.298
We misjudged her on the
secretary of state nomination.

14:15.299 --> 14:17.300
That was different. She blindsided me.

14:17.301 --> 14:19.427
Now she knows my eyes are wide open.

14:19.428 --> 14:21.429
Do you want the gaffney
bag or regular business?

14:21.430 --> 14:24.057
Regular business. Tusk can
dress down if he wants to,

14:24.058 --> 14:25.517
but I'm representing the White House.

14:25.518 --> 14:27.602
Oh, and get Walter Doyle onto Tusk.

14:27.603 --> 14:29.855
- Let's see if we can dig up anything.
- I'll call him right now.

14:29.856 --> 14:32.190
And keep your eye on Janine
Skorsky while I'm away.

14:32.191 --> 14:34.151
She's been prying into Russo.

14:34.152 --> 14:36.528
- What does she know?
- She knows the right questions to ask.

14:36.529 --> 14:38.822
I want to make sure she
doesn't get the right answers.

14:38.823 --> 14:39.948
I'm on it.

14:41.158 --> 14:42.909
McCuddin.

14:45.620 --> 14:47.497
McCuddin.

14:47.498 --> 14:49.248
What was that?

14:49.249 --> 14:51.584
Mccuddin Air Force Base.

14:51.585 --> 14:53.419
Brac hearing.

14:53.420 --> 14:55.630
Was there on April 12th.

14:55.631 --> 14:59.217
David Rasmussen stepped
down less than a week later.

14:59.218 --> 15:00.802
Womack takes his place. So maybe...

15:00.803 --> 15:03.221
Wait. Slow down.

15:03.222 --> 15:05.223
McCuddin is in his district.

15:05.224 --> 15:07.184
Is that the shipyard thing?

15:09.395 --> 15:11.146
Janine, call me back.

15:11.147 --> 15:13.481
I think it was Womack who pressured Russo.

15:13.482 --> 15:18.195
Russo was probably just earning
a favor he could cash in later.

15:18.196 --> 15:19.821
I'm around.

15:21.908 --> 15:24.201
Did you ever have to
fight her to kill a story?

15:24.202 --> 15:26.203
- Janine?
- Yeah. When she worked for you.

15:26.204 --> 15:28.580
Only when I knew she was wrong.

15:28.581 --> 15:31.708
She's trying to draw up
this whole conspiracy thing

15:31.709 --> 15:35.336
with Russo and Frank Underwood
and the whole shipyard closing.

15:35.337 --> 15:36.880
But I'm pretty sure she's wrong.

15:36.881 --> 15:38.882
Pretty sure isn't the same as certain.

15:38.883 --> 15:40.800
- No. I am certain.
- How do you know?

15:40.801 --> 15:42.928
- I have sources.
- Underwood?

15:42.929 --> 15:45.304
No.

15:45.305 --> 15:48.516
No. Never mind. I'll figure it out.

16:36.231 --> 16:39.025
- Mrs. Tusk?
- Jean, please.

16:39.026 --> 16:41.027
You must be Frank. Come in.

16:41.028 --> 16:43.071
So nice to meet you.

16:43.072 --> 16:45.657
The guest room is this way.

16:45.658 --> 16:48.701
It is very kind of you to
have invited me to stay here.

16:48.702 --> 16:52.080
Why waste the taxpayers' money on a hotel

16:52.081 --> 16:54.124
when we have a perfectly good bed?

16:54.125 --> 16:56.709
Well, both they and I are very grateful.

16:56.710 --> 16:59.587
I'm sorry Raymond isn't awake to greet you.

16:59.588 --> 17:02.381
- He goes to bed at...
- I know he's an early riser.

17:02.382 --> 17:04.634
I understand.

17:04.635 --> 17:07.137
Would you like a wake-up knock?

17:07.137 --> 17:09.681
No. I have an alarm on my phone.

17:09.682 --> 17:11.308
Sleep tight.

17:11.309 --> 17:13.392
Thank you so much.

17:54.726 --> 17:58.355
I would say good morning, but
it's the middle of the night.

18:02.275 --> 18:05.028
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- And you too.

18:06.363 --> 18:08.740
Was I making too much noise?

18:08.741 --> 18:11.201
No. I smelled bacon.

18:14.079 --> 18:15.496
Here.

18:17.999 --> 18:19.584
Coffee? Booze?

18:19.585 --> 18:21.669
At 2:00 A.M., you can go either way.

18:21.670 --> 18:23.755
Just water for now.

18:36.893 --> 18:40.397
It's filtered. Your wife would approve.

18:40.398 --> 18:43.441
You ever been to St. Louis before?

18:43.442 --> 18:45.777
Just the airport.

18:45.778 --> 18:47.153
What do you think so far?

18:47.154 --> 18:49.197
Well, I've only seen your neighborhood

18:49.198 --> 18:51.283
and whatever I could see out
the window on the interstate.

18:51.284 --> 18:53.451
Good enough. It's all pretty much the same.

18:53.452 --> 18:55.203
Excuse me.

19:07.924 --> 19:10.343
Listen, um, I still haven't showered.

19:10.344 --> 19:12.845
My mind is on China here.

19:12.846 --> 19:16.141
Uh, what do you say you get a few more zs

19:16.142 --> 19:19.602
and we try this again in a
few hours with our clothes on?

19:19.603 --> 19:21.187
Sounds like a plan.

19:21.188 --> 19:22.939
Meet me at my office at 9:30.

19:22.940 --> 19:26.067
I'll have a driver pick you up.

19:26.068 --> 19:28.778
Can I ask why you do that?

19:28.779 --> 19:31.197
- Do what?
- Tap your ring like that.

19:31.198 --> 19:33.491
I've seen you do it on
TV. Two taps every time

19:33.492 --> 19:36.161
you get up from a table or leave a lectern.

19:36.162 --> 19:38.079
Something my father taught me.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.747
It's meant to harden your knuckles

19:39.748 --> 19:41.958
so you don't break them
if you get into a fight.

19:41.959 --> 19:44.377
It also has the added
benefit of knocking on wood.

19:44.378 --> 19:47.046
My father believed that success

19:47.047 --> 19:50.049
is a mixture of preparation and luck.

19:50.050 --> 19:53.052
Tapping the table kills
both birds with one stone.

19:53.053 --> 19:56.473
Your father was a peach farmer?

19:57.974 --> 20:01.519
Yes, he was. Not a very successful one.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.981
- Lack of preparation or lack of luck?
- Lack of both.

20:04.982 --> 20:07.775
He was better at giving
advice than following it.

20:07.776 --> 20:09.277
Hmm.

20:36.327 --> 20:40.080
Miss? Miss, your card.

20:40.081 --> 20:41.748
Thank you.

20:55.054 --> 20:59.058
Ms. Gallagher, my name's Janine
Skorsky. I'm a reporter at Slugline.

20:59.059 --> 21:01.935
- I wrote the profile on Congressman...
- I remember.

21:01.936 --> 21:04.855
- Do you have a minute?
- If this is about Peter, I...

21:04.856 --> 21:07.524
No. It's about Paul Capra.

21:07.525 --> 21:11.111
We know that he might be running
for Congressman Russo's old seat.

21:11.112 --> 21:12.821
I can't comment on that.

21:12.822 --> 21:14.573
We're just trying to do some background

21:14.574 --> 21:16.158
on the shipyard closing last April.

21:16.159 --> 21:18.327
Listen, I just want to eat my breakfast.

21:18.328 --> 21:22.206
We have sources that are
saying that the Congressman

21:22.207 --> 21:26.835
was being pressured by someone
to not fight the closure.

21:26.836 --> 21:29.671
- Who?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

21:29.672 --> 21:33.800
This is completely off
the record, I promise you.

21:33.801 --> 21:36.720
- Hi, Christina.
- Doug, hi.

21:36.721 --> 21:38.764
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.307
I'm... I'm good.

21:40.308 --> 21:42.726
I saw you sitting over
here. You mind if I...

21:42.727 --> 21:43.977
No. Please.

21:43.978 --> 21:45.979
Ms. Skorsky, right?

21:45.980 --> 21:48.941
I believe we spoke a few times
when you used to work at the herald.

21:48.942 --> 21:50.109
Whenever I could get past

21:50.110 --> 21:51.651
the press office gauntlet to you.

21:51.652 --> 21:54.196
- We do like to run a tight ship.
- Mm.

21:54.197 --> 21:56.156
So what brings you to the capitol?

21:56.157 --> 21:58.409
I was just asking Ms.
Gallagher who's running

21:58.410 --> 22:00.535
to fill the vacant seat
in Pennsylvania's 1st.

22:00.536 --> 22:03.747
Well, the honest answer is we don't know.

22:09.211 --> 22:11.797
Thank you for your time, Ms. Gallagher.

22:21.101 --> 22:22.477
Anyone starts harassing you

22:22.478 --> 22:24.104
with questions you don't want to answer,

22:24.105 --> 22:25.438
you let me know.

22:25.439 --> 22:27.316
I'll handle them.

22:27.317 --> 22:30.110
You got enough on your plate right now.

22:30.111 --> 22:33.655
Thanks, Doug. I appreciate that.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.741
Hang in there, okay?

22:58.264 --> 22:59.556
Yes.

23:02.101 --> 23:04.435
Ah.

23:04.436 --> 23:07.314
Uganda, Peru,

23:07.315 --> 23:11.318
Nepal, Indonesia...

23:11.319 --> 23:12.861
Nicaragua.

23:12.862 --> 23:16.156
Well, you are quite the well traveled man.

23:16.157 --> 23:18.575
No. I'm the man who stays at home.

23:18.576 --> 23:20.702
Jean brought those back for me.

23:20.703 --> 23:22.955
- Mr. Tusk, I am...
- First names.

23:22.956 --> 23:25.624
After all, we have broken bacon together.

23:25.625 --> 23:28.252
We can safely assume that we're familiar.

23:28.253 --> 23:31.004
Raymond, I realize that
you are a very busy man,

23:31.005 --> 23:33.924
so I'm gonna cut right to the chase.

23:33.925 --> 23:36.260
The President sincerely would like you

23:36.261 --> 23:38.304
to become the next Vice President.

23:38.305 --> 23:39.805
That part I already knew.

23:39.806 --> 23:42.433
And I'm here to convince you to say yes.

23:42.434 --> 23:44.517
Another thing I already knew.

23:44.518 --> 23:47.354
Well, I don't know that I can tell
you anything you don't already know.

23:47.355 --> 23:51.482
But perhaps you can tell
me what your hesitation is.

23:54.987 --> 23:56.529
Speak.

24:00.826 --> 24:03.162
Yes.

24:03.163 --> 24:05.705
Now, I understand you
might have some concerns

24:05.706 --> 24:08.106
about the financial disclosures leading...

24:11.462 --> 24:12.754
Speak.

24:16.549 --> 24:18.344
No.

24:19.470 --> 24:23.474
I have eight people representing me

24:23.475 --> 24:26.018
at eight simultaneous meetings

24:26.019 --> 24:27.936
in six time zones right now.

24:27.937 --> 24:30.439
I sit here and answer their questions,

24:30.440 --> 24:32.358
provided they come in the form

24:32.359 --> 24:35.652
of a single yes or no proposition.

24:35.653 --> 24:39.031
Well, then, let me give that a try.

24:39.032 --> 24:42.826
Would you like to be the Vice President?

24:42.827 --> 24:44.328
Yes or no?

24:48.375 --> 24:50.917
Hold on a minute.

24:50.918 --> 24:52.752
I am very sorry.

24:52.753 --> 24:56.382
Let me have 20 minutes
to wrap up these meetings.

24:56.383 --> 24:59.218
And then what do you say
we get out of the office

24:59.219 --> 25:01.387
and away from this damn phone?

25:01.388 --> 25:02.721
Meet me at my car.

25:02.722 --> 25:05.682
Betty can tell you where it's parked.

25:05.683 --> 25:07.267
Go ahead.

25:08.185 --> 25:09.686
He's deflecting.

25:09.687 --> 25:11.688
What I can't tell is whether it's because

25:11.689 --> 25:14.983
he's inclined to say no or
wants to be wooed to say yes.

25:14.984 --> 25:17.819
Either way, I'll have to ease
him into the conversation,

25:17.820 --> 25:19.696
not be so blunt.

25:19.697 --> 25:22.699
This trip may take longer than I thought.

25:22.700 --> 25:26.328
We've looked through all the file cabinets.

25:26.329 --> 25:28.288
They're not on his computer?

25:28.289 --> 25:31.582
Not with the Congressman's
handwritten notes.

25:31.583 --> 25:34.794
All right. I'll check his office.

27:04.635 --> 27:06.637
Ah.

27:08.514 --> 27:11.891
There is a comfort to these woods.

27:15.979 --> 27:18.482
Like they're my backyard.

27:21.286 --> 27:24.622
Well, they are my backyard,
in a way. I own them.

27:24.623 --> 27:26.373
How much land?

27:26.374 --> 27:28.668
Six thousand acres.

27:28.669 --> 27:32.755
You think I could get a tour of
your fulton plant while I'm in town?

27:34.214 --> 27:36.091
If you'd like.

27:36.092 --> 27:38.302
But I don't know why you'd want to be there

27:38.303 --> 27:39.929
when you could be out here.

27:39.930 --> 27:42.181
I've never seen a nuclear plant.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.141
Not much to see.

27:44.142 --> 27:47.561
Steel, concrete, a lot of steam.

27:48.729 --> 27:50.564
The President hasn't exactly been

27:50.565 --> 27:52.566
a big supporter of nuclear power.

27:52.567 --> 27:55.402
Is that, uh, part of your hesitation...

27:55.403 --> 27:57.571
that fear that the administration...

27:57.572 --> 28:00.366
He's just being savvy.

28:00.367 --> 28:04.453
Nuclear energy is a tough sell after Japan.

28:04.454 --> 28:06.998
But it's the only option we have right now

28:06.999 --> 28:10.459
that doesn't completely trash the planet.

28:10.460 --> 28:15.130
The argument against nuclear
power is an emotional one.

28:16.123 --> 28:19.126
And you don't make
decisions based on emotion.

28:20.835 --> 28:25.423
Decisions based on emotion
aren't decisions at all.

28:25.424 --> 28:28.802
They're instincts,

28:28.803 --> 28:31.304
which can be of value.

28:31.305 --> 28:34.682
The rational and the irrational
complement each other.

28:34.683 --> 28:38.937
Individually, they're far less powerful.

28:38.938 --> 28:40.855
And which category do your thoughts

28:40.856 --> 28:44.192
on the vice presidency fall into?

28:47.029 --> 28:49.363
Do you hear that song?

28:50.531 --> 28:52.242
It's a hermit thrush.

28:53.911 --> 28:55.954
Can't see him.

28:57.038 --> 28:59.124
"Solitary, the thrush..."

29:03.503 --> 29:08.382
"The hermit, withdrawn to himself,

29:08.383 --> 29:11.385
avoiding the settlements,

29:11.386 --> 29:14.681
sings by himself a song."

29:17.558 --> 29:20.145
- Do you know the poem?
- No, I don't.

29:20.146 --> 29:21.688
It's Walt Whitman.

29:21.689 --> 29:23.815
It's about the death of Abraham Lincoln.

29:23.816 --> 29:26.193
He's over there somewhere.

29:27.319 --> 29:28.778
Yes, I know the damn poem.

29:28.779 --> 29:30.780
We studied it at the Sentinel.

29:30.781 --> 29:32.949
I said to my Professor,
"why mourn the death

29:32.950 --> 29:34.868
of Presidents, or anyone for that matter?

29:34.869 --> 29:36.286
The dead can't hear us."

29:36.287 --> 29:38.330
And he asked me if I believed in heaven.

29:38.331 --> 29:39.706
I said no.

29:39.627 --> 29:42.003
And then he asked if I had no faith in God.

29:42.004 --> 29:43.838
I said, "you have it wrong.

29:43.839 --> 29:46.591
It's God who has no faith in us."

29:47.508 --> 29:49.970
Deeper into the woods.

29:49.971 --> 29:51.930
I think you're being paranoid.

29:51.931 --> 29:55.016
He came up right after I
sat down. It was creepy.

29:55.017 --> 29:57.894
- I'm telling you, it was womack.
- Is that what Underwood said?

29:57.895 --> 30:00.354
He didn't name names. But who else?

30:00.355 --> 30:03.357
What's the big deal?
Congressmen trade favors.

30:03.358 --> 30:05.693
One of these congressmen committed suicide.

30:05.694 --> 30:08.155
I think you're stretching here,
Janine. To try and connect...

30:08.156 --> 30:09.948
I have gone after big fish before.

30:09.949 --> 30:11.950
I know what it feels like to be watched.

30:17.873 --> 30:20.083
Underwood's education
bill went to the floor

30:20.084 --> 30:22.669
just three days after womack
became majority leader.

30:22.670 --> 30:25.880
You leaked the education bill. And
then there was the Kern article.

30:25.881 --> 30:28.549
- Those were two completely different stories.
- Wait. What was the guy?

30:28.550 --> 30:31.594
Uh, what was his name?
He's the one who told

30:31.595 --> 30:33.638
that Kern wrote the article
for the school paper.

30:33.639 --> 30:35.849
- Roy Kapeniak.
- You should go talk to him.

30:35.850 --> 30:38.893
- There's no link.
- Except you.

30:41.604 --> 30:43.564
Underwood's been using you, Zoe.

30:43.565 --> 30:45.692
Don't you want to know why?

30:48.111 --> 30:50.280
Hi.

30:50.281 --> 30:52.073
Remy Danton's on line two.

30:52.074 --> 30:54.450
He says it's important.

30:55.703 --> 30:57.620
- Hello, Remy.
- Hey, Claire.

30:57.621 --> 30:59.998
I got a call from the P.R. team at Sancorp.

30:59.999 --> 31:02.500
They said Gillian Cole
isn't being cooperative.

31:02.501 --> 31:05.837
Hasn't gotten back to them, you mean?

31:05.838 --> 31:09.216
No. Told them point-blank she
doesn't want the film crew there.

31:09.217 --> 31:11.592
I'm looking at an e-mail.
She wrote that they would be

31:11.593 --> 31:13.678
disruptive to the project
and local community.

31:13.679 --> 31:15.722
Is that her, or is that coming from you?

31:15.723 --> 31:18.850
No. I made it very clear that
I wanted her to work with them.

31:18.851 --> 31:22.645
Well, it seems like
she's doing the opposite.

31:22.646 --> 31:24.647
I will speak to her,

31:24.648 --> 31:27.317
and then I'll sort things out
with the P.R. team personally.

31:27.318 --> 31:29.944
- Thank you, Claire.
- You bet.

31:42.540 --> 31:44.542
Is Gillian at lunch?

31:44.543 --> 31:47.587
She didn't come in yet
today. She's not feeling well.

31:47.588 --> 31:49.089
Let me know when she gets here.

31:49.090 --> 31:51.091
- What time is your flight?
- 6:40.

31:51.092 --> 31:53.260
We should get going.
There's gonna be traffic.

31:53.261 --> 31:54.969
Almost ready.

31:58.723 --> 32:00.392
I've been thinking.

32:00.393 --> 32:03.477
The, uh, older man you were with.

32:03.478 --> 32:05.939
Was it Underwood?

32:12.486 --> 32:16.283
So, what this is really about
is covering your own ass.

32:16.284 --> 32:19.535
- That is not true.
- You don't want anybody to know you were sleeping with him.

32:19.536 --> 32:21.579
Not exactly objective reporting, is it?

32:21.580 --> 32:23.998
Don't fucking lecture me
on journalistic ethics.

32:23.999 --> 32:26.293
How many of the stories you brought me
at the herald were because you were...

32:26.294 --> 32:27.961
I'm not gonna have this conversation.

32:27.962 --> 32:29.963
Fine. Maybe you should
take a cab to the airport.

32:29.964 --> 32:31.589
Don't punish me for being honest.

32:31.590 --> 32:33.549
You haven't been honest. I had to ask.

32:33.550 --> 32:36.803
- And you still haven't given me a straight answer.
- Yes.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.889
It was him.

32:41.099 --> 32:43.435
I... I don't know if I can do this, Zoe.

32:43.436 --> 32:46.062
- Do what?
- You fucked a Congressman to get ahead.

32:46.063 --> 32:48.731
I'm not the first person to ever
do something like that, Lucas.

32:48.732 --> 32:50.317
But I'm not sleeping with
those other people, am I?

32:50.318 --> 32:51.692
What, so you just hate me now?

32:51.693 --> 32:52.860
No. I probably love you.

32:52.861 --> 32:55.905
That's the fucking problem.

33:01.161 --> 33:04.247
Let's go. I'm parked illegally.

33:05.873 --> 33:09.585
So I hear you went stomping
through the woods today.

33:09.586 --> 33:11.545
We did, and then Raymond was kind enough

33:11.546 --> 33:14.090
to arrange a tour of the fulton plant.

33:14.091 --> 33:15.925
And I'm sure you were wondering,

33:15.926 --> 33:19.179
"when is this old fool gonna
get around to brass tacks?"

33:19.180 --> 33:21.473
I'm here to simply answer questions.

33:21.474 --> 33:24.309
I figured that you would make
up your mind when you're ready.

33:25.852 --> 33:28.771
There are two minds here.

33:28.772 --> 33:31.565
We know all about the blind trust.

33:32.984 --> 33:34.652
Does it concern either of you?

33:34.653 --> 33:37.197
The words "blind" and "trust"

33:37.198 --> 33:39.699
are not among my favorites
in the English language.

33:39.700 --> 33:43.619
But I have no problem with it in theory.

33:43.620 --> 33:46.289
Not managing our assets for a few years

33:46.290 --> 33:49.042
could unburden us from
a great deal of stress.

33:49.043 --> 33:51.378
Well, then, what does
your reluctance stem from?

33:51.379 --> 33:53.213
Why do you think the President wants me?

33:53.214 --> 33:55.923
Well, I can't speak on his
behalf, but if I were to...

33:55.924 --> 33:59.511
Aren't you here to do just
that... speak on his behalf?

34:01.388 --> 34:04.224
If I were to speculate, I think
the President would prob...

34:04.225 --> 34:06.642
Speculation is a poor form of investment

34:06.643 --> 34:08.978
and an equally poor form of politics.

34:08.978 --> 34:11.272
Tell me what you know.

34:11.273 --> 34:14.650
I don't know what you mean.

34:14.650 --> 34:17.695
Well, what do you think I should do?

34:17.696 --> 34:19.655
You, personally, Frank Underwood?

34:19.656 --> 34:21.449
My opinion isn't what matters here.

34:21.449 --> 34:24.784
It does to me. Should I do it? Yes or no?

34:27.121 --> 34:29.290
Well, there's a great number
of things to consider...

34:29.291 --> 34:32.252
And I'm sure you've considered them all.

34:32.253 --> 34:34.170
Yes or no, Frank?

34:36.880 --> 34:40.134
No, I will not answer that question.

34:40.135 --> 34:43.012
- Because you think I shouldn't.
- Because it's not relevant.

34:43.013 --> 34:47.100
All right, then. Let
me ask you another way.

34:47.101 --> 34:50.228
- Would you take the job?
- It hasn't been offered to me.

34:50.228 --> 34:52.480
What if it were?

34:52.481 --> 34:55.315
I have a distaste for hypotheticals

34:55.317 --> 34:57.693
just the same as you have
a distaste for speculation.

34:59.321 --> 35:01.906
All right, all right.

35:01.907 --> 35:05.076
That's enough business for now.
We can discuss it more tomorrow.

36:01.799 --> 36:02.925
Oh!

36:02.926 --> 36:05.595
Get in. Get in there, Bruce.

36:05.596 --> 36:07.639
Sorry. Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.765
Um, I'm looking for Roy Kapeniak.

36:09.766 --> 36:12.352
I thought his trailer was over
here. Am I in the right place?

36:12.353 --> 36:14.728
You're in the right place a month ago.

36:14.729 --> 36:16.272
He got evicted.

36:16.273 --> 36:18.566
He was shootin' off his
gun too much in the yard.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.652
- Do you know where I can find him?
- Why?

36:20.653 --> 36:23.863
I'm a relative. His... his niece.

36:23.864 --> 36:25.281
Skipped town is what I heard.

36:25.282 --> 36:28.701
Had a girl livin' with
him. Maybe she knows.

36:28.702 --> 36:30.328
- Name was Echo.
- Echo?

36:30.329 --> 36:33.206
That's what she went by, at least.

36:33.207 --> 36:35.583
Works at the titty bar over on 40.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.751
- Highway 40?
- Mm.

36:37.752 --> 36:39.337
Across from the Burger King.

36:39.338 --> 36:40.630
Okay. Thank you.

36:53.518 --> 36:55.019
- Girls get in free.
- Oh.

36:55.020 --> 36:56.812
- I'm looking for Echo.
- Who?

36:56.813 --> 36:58.105
Echo.

37:16.583 --> 37:18.292
Roy was a fucking wacko.

37:18.293 --> 37:20.420
I was stupid to live
with him as long as I did.

37:20.421 --> 37:22.755
- Do you know where he is now?
- I don't know, and I don't care.

37:22.756 --> 37:25.007
He ever talk about the article I wrote?

37:25.008 --> 37:27.510
All the time. He had it framed.

37:27.511 --> 37:30.763
Bet it's still in the trailer if
it's not in a junkyard right now.

37:30.764 --> 37:32.724
Did he say why he called me?

37:32.725 --> 37:35.435
- Did he ever tell you?
- I was there.

37:35.436 --> 37:37.978
- Where?
- When the guy showed up.

37:37.979 --> 37:39.980
Who?

37:42.442 --> 37:45.612
I won't name names.

37:45.613 --> 37:47.614
Fuck Roy Kapeniak.

37:47.615 --> 37:49.699
You don't owe him shit.

37:52.118 --> 37:54.287
Some guy who said he was a Congressman.

37:59.250 --> 38:02.086
Was it...

38:02.087 --> 38:03.713
Him?

38:03.714 --> 38:05.465
No.

38:05.466 --> 38:07.508
He was younger, tall,

38:07.509 --> 38:10.136
not much hair, pretty good-looking.

38:14.682 --> 38:17.477
- Yeah, that was him.
- You're absolutely sure?

38:17.478 --> 38:19.895
He brought bourbon, blow,
stayed the whole night.

38:19.896 --> 38:21.481
The whole thing was his idea.

38:21.482 --> 38:24.150
What, to say that Kern wrote the editorial?

38:24.151 --> 38:26.819
That guy didn't write
anything. It was all Roy.

38:26.820 --> 38:29.155
Okay, look, I know I said
that I wouldn't name names,

38:29.156 --> 38:31.031
and I won't if that's what you want.

38:31.032 --> 38:33.117
But you could be famous overnight.

38:33.118 --> 38:35.495
- Talk shows, TV, the whole country...
- No way.

38:35.496 --> 38:38.414
You wouldn't have to dance anymore.
You could do whatever you want.

38:38.415 --> 38:42.502
Don't use my fucking name, okay? I
already said more than I should have.

38:59.751 --> 39:02.128
- Stamper, it's midnight.
- Two things, boss.

39:02.129 --> 39:05.423
First, Janine Skorsky ambushed
Christina this morning.

39:05.424 --> 39:08.217
I intercepted her before
she could ask too much.

39:08.218 --> 39:11.011
- Should we be worried?
- I can keep this contained, sir.

39:11.012 --> 39:13.681
- I just wanted you to know.
- All right. What's the other thing?

39:13.682 --> 39:15.808
Doyle came back with his research.

39:15.809 --> 39:17.851
I just e-mailed it to you.

39:17.852 --> 39:20.354
The President told you he and
Tusk didn't know each other, right?

39:20.355 --> 39:24.233
Yeah. He said they met once,
I think, at a fund-raiser.

39:24.234 --> 39:25.943
That would appear to be a lie.

39:25.944 --> 39:27.612
All right. I have it in front of me now.

39:27.613 --> 39:29.863
Doyle catalogued all the
instances he could find

39:29.864 --> 39:32.116
in which the two of them were in
the same city at the same time.

39:32.117 --> 39:34.827
Items in red are events
that they both attended.

39:34.828 --> 39:36.454
And he found something else.

39:36.455 --> 39:38.790
Back in Walker's private sector days,

39:38.791 --> 39:41.083
he was the C.E.O. of Pioneer Airlines.

39:41.084 --> 39:45.171
Guess who owned a third of the
stock when it was sold to united?

39:45.172 --> 39:46.922
Raymond Tusk.

39:46.923 --> 39:49.925
My guess is that he and Walker
know each other quite well.

39:51.761 --> 39:54.221
All right. Let me look this
over. I'll call you back.

40:03.105 --> 40:05.441
I'm being played.

40:07.443 --> 40:09.487
But why?

40:17.787 --> 40:19.913
- Did I wake you again?
- No.

40:19.914 --> 40:21.541
I'd like to talk.

40:21.542 --> 40:23.751
Give me a moment.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.602
Carolina Parakeet.

40:54.603 --> 40:56.937
You're wrong, but you're close.

40:57.980 --> 41:00.107
This is the Sun Conure.

41:00.108 --> 41:01.984
They look very similar,

41:01.985 --> 41:05.029
but the Carolina Parakeet is extinct.

41:04.680 --> 41:07.640
Was killed off because
it was considered a pest.

41:07.641 --> 41:10.643
Interesting species, though.

41:10.644 --> 41:11.670
Voracious appetite.

41:11.771 --> 41:14.561
And he was poison. Cats who ate him died.

41:16.151 --> 41:19.029
This bird is not the only
thing you've misidentified

41:19.030 --> 41:20.864
since you've been in St. Louis.

41:20.865 --> 41:23.658
You and Walker are old friends.

41:23.659 --> 41:25.994
I wasn't sent here to vet you.

41:25.995 --> 41:28.080
Very good.

41:28.081 --> 41:30.249
Tell me why I am here, then.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.125
So I can vet you.

41:32.126 --> 41:34.878
For the vice presidency?

41:34.879 --> 41:39.549
The President values my advice,
and he tends to follow it.

41:39.550 --> 41:43.095
Like when I advised him not
to make you Secretary of State.

41:47.183 --> 41:49.184
That was very bad advice.

41:49.185 --> 41:51.103
Yes, it was.

41:51.104 --> 41:53.188
One of the larger mistakes I've made,

41:53.189 --> 41:56.858
and I very rarely make
mistakes of any size.

41:56.859 --> 42:01.821
You've proven yourself
to be quite difficult.

42:03.156 --> 42:06.785
Kern, the teachers' strike, now Matthews.

42:06.786 --> 42:08.828
You attribute all that to me?

42:08.829 --> 42:10.872
If I had to guess.

42:10.873 --> 42:15.127
A smart man once said to me that
speculation is a poor form of politics.

42:15.128 --> 42:17.212
Why don't you stick to
what you know, Raymond?

42:19.423 --> 42:23.468
What I know is you are extremely effective

42:23.469 --> 42:25.637
at what you set your mind to.

42:25.638 --> 42:27.555
That is valuable to me,

42:27.556 --> 42:31.351
and I've already told Garrett
that it could be valuable to him...

42:31.352 --> 42:36.022
somebody at his side with one
foot in the executive branch

42:36.023 --> 42:37.649
and one in the legislative.

42:37.650 --> 42:40.402
He is very open to the idea.

42:42.779 --> 42:45.782
My turn to speculate.

42:45.783 --> 42:48.827
Your recommendation...

42:48.828 --> 42:50.912
comes at a price.

42:56.251 --> 42:58.211
Fact.

42:58.212 --> 43:01.173
I have something that you want.

43:01.174 --> 43:04.259
You have something that I want.

43:04.260 --> 43:06.761
Have I said something amusing?

43:06.762 --> 43:10.432
Oh, I've just sat too many
times on your side of the table

43:10.433 --> 43:13.559
not to enjoy the irony of
finding myself on this side of it.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.812
Would you like to hear what I want?

43:15.813 --> 43:18.398
I don't shackle myself
to people I don't know.

43:18.399 --> 43:21.818
What I want is one favor.

43:21.819 --> 43:25.405
One and only one.

43:25.406 --> 43:26.739
Which is?

43:26.740 --> 43:28.741
I need to be certain you'll grant it

43:28.742 --> 43:31.411
before I'll take the risk
of being more specific.

43:31.412 --> 43:32.996
A blank check.

43:32.997 --> 43:34.789
Of sorts.

43:34.790 --> 43:37.876
You would never grant anyone a blank check.

43:37.877 --> 43:41.171
No. But I'm not sitting
on that side of the table.

43:43.298 --> 43:46.301
We still believe in
handshakes where I come from.

43:46.302 --> 43:48.345
Do they still mean anything in Washington?

43:48.346 --> 43:51.848
- Who are you calling?
- Car service to get me to the airport.

43:51.849 --> 43:54.434
Frank,

43:54.435 --> 43:58.355
I will tell the President
that I want until Friday

43:58.356 --> 44:01.024
to think things over before
I make my recommendation.

44:01.025 --> 44:02.650
Let me know if you change your mind.

44:02.651 --> 44:04.319
And let me arrange the car for you.

44:04.320 --> 44:06.654
Hi. I'd like to arrange a car, please.

44:12.618 --> 44:15.038
- How are you feeling?
- Better than yesterday.

44:15.039 --> 44:18.291
But I might take off early
if, uh, the nausea comes back.

44:18.292 --> 44:22.962
I find it interesting that you stay home the
day after you blow off the sancorp people.

44:22.963 --> 44:26.258
You weren't feeling sick, Gillian.

44:26.259 --> 44:31.137
I find it extremely offensive that you'd
accuse me of hiding behind my pregnancy.

44:31.138 --> 44:33.515
You knew what I wanted.

44:33.516 --> 44:35.016
The Botswana project is mine.

44:35.017 --> 44:37.936
Under my umbrella, using money I raised.

44:37.937 --> 44:40.439
You promised me autonomy.

44:41.565 --> 44:44.650
Um, excuse us for a moment, please.

44:48.988 --> 44:51.866
I promised to empower you.
That's not the same thing

44:51.867 --> 44:54.660
as you doing as you choose
without consulting me.

44:54.661 --> 44:57.705
I'm not gonna allow a project I've put
almost three years of my life into...

44:57.706 --> 45:01.000
your project wouldn't be happening
if it weren't for sancorp.

45:01.001 --> 45:02.668
I didn't ask for their help.

45:02.669 --> 45:05.547
How about consulting me
before you struck a deal?

45:05.548 --> 45:07.549
Let's get something very clear.

45:07.550 --> 45:11.303
I run the organization. You work for it.

45:11.304 --> 45:14.055
Our agreement is an affiliation, Claire.

45:14.056 --> 45:17.559
- Worldwell isn't your vassal.
- Yes, it is, entirely,

45:17.560 --> 45:19.227
if we're going to be blunt about it.

45:19.228 --> 45:21.438
That's not what you
proposed six months ago.

45:21.439 --> 45:23.523
It's what you signed up for
when you signed the contract.

45:23.524 --> 45:25.733
There was a good faith
understanding that...

45:25.734 --> 45:27.944
And you dissolved that
good faith by disobeying me.

45:29.321 --> 45:32.240
- Disobeying you?
- Yes.

45:35.076 --> 45:37.370
I threaten you, don't I?

45:37.371 --> 45:40.039
Nothing about you threatens me.

45:40.040 --> 45:42.834
But maybe you should
take a leave of absence.

45:42.835 --> 45:45.003
Are you firing me?

45:45.004 --> 45:47.547
That's up to you, but
right now you should leave.

45:52.803 --> 45:54.513
Did you get her on record?

45:54.514 --> 45:56.473
No. She wouldn't talk to me otherwise.

45:56.474 --> 45:59.267
We need hard proof that
Underwood was behind it.

45:59.268 --> 46:01.811
This whole thing is
making me really nervous.

46:01.812 --> 46:03.938
That you'll be exposed?

46:03.939 --> 46:06.441
Not that.

46:07.317 --> 46:09.444
It's Francis.

46:09.445 --> 46:12.322
If this really goes as deep as we
think, and he's already watching you...

46:12.323 --> 46:15.033
- You think he's dangerous?
- I know he is.

46:15.034 --> 46:18.911
Then that's why we have to keep going.

46:18.912 --> 46:21.080
He crushes people...

46:26.211 --> 46:28.796
- Hey, Callum.
- Hey.

46:34.135 --> 46:37.681
Look, if you weren't afraid,
you wouldn't be doing your job.

46:37.682 --> 46:40.058
The only articles that I have ever written

46:40.059 --> 46:42.394
that truly mattered
scared the shit out of me.

46:42.395 --> 46:46.064
We need to know about anything
that might've happened with Russo.

46:46.065 --> 46:49.401
Something Underwood
could have held over him.

46:49.402 --> 46:51.444
We have to go back to Christina Gallagher,

46:51.445 --> 46:53.154
see if she'll give us something.

46:53.155 --> 46:55.574
It can't be me. If I go
back for a second time...

46:55.575 --> 46:57.492
I'll do it.

46:57.153 --> 47:00.780
You honestly had no idea that
the President and Tusk were close?

47:00.781 --> 47:03.200
He never showed up once on any call sheet,

47:03.201 --> 47:06.578
phone log or schedule during the
campaign or since we've been in office.

47:06.579 --> 47:09.373
I'd love to believe you, Linda,
but I'm finding it very difficult.

47:09.374 --> 47:11.291
What would I gain by
keeping you in the dark?

47:11.292 --> 47:12.751
I am as shocked as you are, Frank.

47:12.752 --> 47:14.544
Well, don't let on that you know.

47:14.545 --> 47:16.838
- Of course not.
- What's the President saying?

47:16.839 --> 47:19.465
He wants to meet with you Tuesday
to get your report on Tusk.

47:19.466 --> 47:22.886
- That's a farce.
- Should I come up with a reason to delay the meeting?

47:22.887 --> 47:25.597
- No. Maybe we'll learn something. What time?
- 2:00 P.M.

47:25.598 --> 47:28.600
All right. I'll be there. Thank you, Linda.

47:28.601 --> 47:31.853
- We have one week.
- To accomplish what exactly?

47:31.854 --> 47:35.399
To force Tusk's hand. He
wants me beholden to him? No.

47:35.400 --> 47:38.318
We have to make him come crawling to me.

47:38.319 --> 47:41.405
What's his weakness?

47:41.406 --> 47:42.864
His fortune.

47:42.865 --> 47:44.950
Wouldn't you say that's his strength?

47:44.951 --> 47:47.160
Not if it's slipping away.

47:47.161 --> 47:49.537
- How do you make 40 billion disappear overnight?
- We can't.

47:49.538 --> 47:51.915
But maybe we can create the
illusion that it's in danger.

47:51.916 --> 47:54.000
The brief you gave me on his assets.

47:54.001 --> 47:59.214
How much of his total net
worth is... in nuclear power?

47:59.215 --> 48:02.634
About a third. Sixteen reactors
here in the states, 37 worldwide.

48:02.635 --> 48:04.677
Well, that's what we hit him with.

48:04.678 --> 48:06.305
We go after his nuclear interests.

48:06.306 --> 48:09.099
Even so, he's got 25
billion in other investments.

48:09.100 --> 48:11.351
Doug, this is a man who built
his fortune from nothing.

48:11.352 --> 48:13.270
The money doesn't mean anything to him.

48:13.271 --> 48:15.147
It's what it represents.

48:15.148 --> 48:17.190
- Which is what?
- His life's work.

48:17.191 --> 48:19.734
Get Remy Danton on the phone. Set
up a meeting as quickly as you can.

48:19.735 --> 48:22.528
You got it.

48:22.529 --> 48:26.116
Tusk understands the difference
between power and money.

48:26.117 --> 48:28.201
That's precisely what makes him dangerous.

48:28.202 --> 48:32.164
He doesn't measure his wealth in
private jets but purchased souls.

48:32.165 --> 48:35.959
I've worked too hard to get
within arm's reach of the prize

48:35.960 --> 48:40.046
only to have my hand cut
off just before I seize it.

48:40.047 --> 48:43.467
Zoe Barnes, here to
see Christina Gallagher.

48:45.177 --> 48:46.970
I'm sorry. I don't see an appointment.

48:46.971 --> 48:48.972
Oh, there must be a
mistake. I have an 11:30.

48:48.973 --> 48:50.514
One second.

48:52.017 --> 48:54.186
My name is Zoe Barnes.

48:54.187 --> 48:57.397
I work at Slugline. You spoke
to my colleague Janine Skorsky.

48:57.398 --> 49:00.692
- Miss...
- Oh, we're fine, thanks.

49:00.693 --> 49:02.444
You can't just come in here...

49:02.445 --> 49:04.612
there are things you
don't know about Peter.

49:04.613 --> 49:08.532
- I wrote the article about Roy Kapeniak.
- Please leave. Right now.

49:08.533 --> 49:10.994
It was Peter who convinced
him to talk to me.

49:10.995 --> 49:14.414
What? I don't... I don't understand.

49:14.415 --> 49:16.708
- Why would he...
- Somebody pressured him to do it.

49:16.709 --> 49:21.171
The night of January 24th. That's
when he went to speak to Kapeniak.

49:21.172 --> 49:24.966
Do you remember anything strange
around the time of the inauguration?

49:24.967 --> 49:27.427
- Anything that could have been held over him?
- No, I don't.

49:27.428 --> 49:32.057
If he was mixed up in things that in
any way contributed to his suicide,

49:32.058 --> 49:34.184
wouldn't you want to know?

49:34.185 --> 49:36.602
I'm not trying to cause you any more pain.

49:36.603 --> 49:38.771
I just want the truth.

49:38.772 --> 49:40.940
And you deserve that more than anyone.

49:43.402 --> 49:45.695
- What was the date?
- The 24th of January.
