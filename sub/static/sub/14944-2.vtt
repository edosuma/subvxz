00:45.296 --> 00:47.958

to get us home

Stop talking shit, Kellogg.
Let the man speak.

05:48.224 --> 05:50.556
I've run the calculations
a dozen times,

05:50.643 --> 05:54.807

to bring about fusion and
power the device, but really?

what if this is where
we're supposed to be?

You scared of
another trip down
the rabbit hole?

06:05.241 --> 06:07.106
No, but I see
a reason to stay.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.824
Look around.
What do you see?

06:10.621 --> 06:14.739

the rich getting richer.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.329
But freedoms still exist.

06:21.507 --> 06:25.295
We're free to tell people
what's being done
to them, and by who,

06:25.636 --> 06:28.469
and there's no one to
arrest or execute us.

and the rich to suck eggs.

really trying to say?
