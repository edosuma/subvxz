00:01.268 --> 00:02.803
- Why do you have a picture of
the bus driver on your phone?

00:02.903 --> 00:04.905
Oh! You like him!

00:05.005 --> 00:07.441
- Give me my phone! [grunts]
- Dang, girl!

00:07.541 --> 00:09.676
- I'm going to the mall.
- You don't even know him.

00:09.776 --> 00:13.113
- I will be back in one hour.
- Fine! I'm coming too!

00:13.213 --> 00:17.217
- Cora and I have decided
that we would like 98%!

00:17.317 --> 00:19.186
- He's trying to
take advantage of us.

00:19.286 --> 00:22.055
- What about a 50/50 split?
- Sound like a good deal to me.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.657
- You and Mr. Brown shake on it.

00:26.059 --> 00:27.060
- CORA AND LEAH:
[screaming]

00:27.160 --> 00:28.529

- No, no, I mean,
like, this is amazing.

00:39.214 --> 00:40.482

00:40.583 --> 00:43.052
"Baby, this is amazing!
Baby, this is amaz--"

00:43.152 --> 00:45.454
You've been
saying that for hours.

00:45.554 --> 00:46.989
- Mr. Brown, you
don't understand, man.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.091
We really been
hoping for a miracle,

00:49.191 --> 00:50.626
and you just came
through and saved us.

00:50.726 --> 00:52.561
Like, we really appreciate you.

00:52.661 --> 00:55.331
- Well, you know, I have
been known to be miracle-ish.

00:55.431 --> 00:57.866
- [laughter]

00:57.967 --> 00:58.934
- Well, thank you.

00:59.034 --> 01:00.936
- Yeah, you're
welcome, my child.

01:01.036 --> 01:03.939
That's the way you do it and
say it when you're miracle-ish.

01:04.039 --> 01:05.307
- Well, our lawyer
looked over the contract.

01:05.407 --> 01:08.077
Everything is good.
So, Mr. Brown, go ahead.

01:08.177 --> 01:09.545
You sign it.
- Okay.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.183
Leroy M. Brown.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.619
The M is for Making Money, now.

01:16.719 --> 01:17.953
- All right.
- [laughs]

01:18.053 --> 01:19.288
- What's taking you
so long, then?

01:19.388 --> 01:21.223
- I got to make it
look good 'cause Cora,

01:21.323 --> 01:23.259
you know people be
forgery-ing my name.

01:24.393 --> 01:26.528
I got to make it official.

01:26.629 --> 01:28.964
And then I'ma come back
this way and go back over.

01:29.064 --> 01:30.666
That way, nobody can copy it.

01:30.766 --> 01:33.369
And then you gotta make it
look official like this.

01:33.469 --> 01:35.404
- Oh, okay, two--
- Hold on.

01:35.504 --> 01:36.505
- [two taps]

01:38.007 --> 01:40.376
- Copy that.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.945
- And Grandpa.

01:43.045 --> 01:45.180
- CORA: Mr. Vinny.

01:45.281 --> 01:48.050
- I ain't signing that.
- Man, we not doing this again.

01:48.150 --> 01:51.053
Sign the paper.
- But why I got to sign?

01:51.153 --> 01:53.989
- Because you need running
water and I need a bath.

01:54.156 --> 01:57.026
- And if that ain't enough to
make you sign it, nothing is.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.361
- I have a cramp in my hand.

01:59.461 --> 02:01.664
- I bet you do from holding
that hook for all these years.

02:01.764 --> 02:03.065
- [laughs]

02:04.333 --> 02:07.503
- Okay, then. Fine.

02:07.603 --> 02:08.537
- Thank you.

02:16.946 --> 02:18.280
- Man, that's a X!

02:19.181 --> 02:20.549
- Man, that's my name.

02:20.649 --> 02:22.017
- You gonna sign
this paper right now.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.186
I mean it.
- Or what?

02:24.286 --> 02:26.755
- Or I'm gonna go
lay in your bed.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.391
And then after that, I'm calling
the Social Security office

02:29.491 --> 02:31.293
and I'm telling them you've been
walking around here faking like

02:31.393 --> 02:32.995
you got one hand
all these years.

02:33.128 --> 02:34.396
- Mm!

02:34.496 --> 02:36.498
- Look at here, son.
- JEREMY: I'll do it.

02:36.599 --> 02:40.736
- Do not play with a man's
disability or his weed, okay?

02:44.807 --> 02:46.141
All right, fine.

02:50.913 --> 02:52.448
- So here we are.
We have a deal.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.050
- This is so exciting!
[laughs]

02:55.150 --> 02:56.986
- We got it here!
- You did it, Mr. Brown.

02:57.152 --> 03:01.957
I can't believe we in business
again in such a nice place.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.159
- Nice place?
- Mm-hmm.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.362
- Cora, you looked at this
trash?

03:06.462 --> 03:08.330
- You gotta have 20/20
vision, Mr. Brown.

03:08.430 --> 03:10.065
- Yes, you gotta have faith.

03:10.165 --> 03:11.333
Boy, this place
is gonna be so nice.

03:11.433 --> 03:12.868
We're gonna make so much money.

03:12.968 --> 03:17.773
- I hope so, 'cause we got
$40,000--$40,000 in this--

03:17.873 --> 03:19.708
- We are, we are, Mr. Brown.
You got to have faith.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.844
I done prayed about it.
It's gonna happen.

03:21.944 --> 03:23.679
- While you're praying--
- Mm-hmm?

03:23.779 --> 03:25.547
- --why don't you pray
for this demon right here?

03:27.750 --> 03:30.386
You know that's the devil
walking around here.

03:30.486 --> 03:32.288
If he ain't the devil,
who else would walk around,

03:32.388 --> 03:35.124
saying they got a hook
for all these years

03:35.157 --> 03:37.559
and turns out
he got a real hand?

03:37.660 --> 03:39.495
- You know, it's freeing
not having that hook.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.031
Now I can give you the finger.

03:42.131 --> 03:43.465
- Mr. Vinny!

03:45.267 --> 03:46.769
What is wrong with you?

03:46.869 --> 03:47.836
- Pew!

03:49.838 --> 03:52.575
- Before it's over, I'ma
pray all of this out of you.

03:52.675 --> 03:55.144
- You know what, Cora?
- CORA: Hmm?

03:55.177 --> 03:56.412
- I like you.

03:56.512 --> 03:58.747
- Oh, that's nice, Mr. Vinny.

03:58.847 --> 04:02.284
- I'm not gonna cuss around you.
- Thank you.

04:02.384 --> 04:03.953
- But that polka-dot
bastard right there?

04:06.155 --> 04:07.656
- Mr. Vinny!

04:07.756 --> 04:10.192
- I'm gonna say every
cuss word I can.

04:12.528 --> 04:14.797
- Starting with this--
- Don't you say it!

04:15.622 --> 04:17.090

You talking about this
contract here, right?

04:38.020 --> 04:40.689
Well, it says right here--
look at that, look at that.

04:40.789 --> 04:45.027
Says right here that
"Money upon signing."

04:45.127 --> 04:46.128
Booyah.

around here using
my sexiness as a lure.

05:05.781 --> 05:07.049
See, I was gonna be
the entertainment.

05:07.149 --> 05:09.184
Watch that.
Watch it like that.

05:09.284 --> 05:12.087
They'd give a good offer
for something like this, Cora.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.389
- Come on, now,
give 'em the check.

05:14.489 --> 05:16.391
- I ain't going over there.
He stinks.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.429
He smell like sanitation.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.731
- Well, look, as soon as
you give him the money,

05:22.831 --> 05:27.202
then we can get the water turned
on and I can get cleaned up.

05:27.302 --> 05:28.770
- Sounds good.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.606
- You give it to him 'cause
I'm not going near him.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.875
He probably got--you probably
got stink residue on you.

05:36.945 --> 05:39.214
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:39.281 --> 05:42.584

This is amazing!

05:42.684 --> 05:43.752
Here.

05:45.354 --> 05:46.989
- Wait a minute. Hold up.

05:47.089 --> 05:50.659
Just hold up one minute.
- What?

05:50.759 --> 05:53.095
- How the hell we know
this check is good?

05:53.228 --> 05:54.930
- The check is good.

05:55.030 --> 05:59.234
- I don't trust a man with that
much damn polka dot on him.

05:59.267 --> 06:02.471
- And I don't trust a man
that wear solid colors.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.374
- Then we even
- All them colors the same.

06:05.474 --> 06:07.109
Who would do such a thing?

06:07.242 --> 06:09.745
Wear clothes with two colors.

06:09.845 --> 06:11.613
- Well, who would wear clothes
that look like cat vomit?

06:11.713 --> 06:14.149
- Oh! Hold on, wait.
Grandpa--Grandpa Vinny.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.617
- Nah, I don't--I
don't like this.

06:15.717 --> 06:18.253
I don't like this at all.
- Will you stop it, Grandpa?

06:18.286 --> 06:20.355
- No, this--this
don't even feel right.

06:20.455 --> 06:23.091
- You still gotta
take a Dana test.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.526
- I'm not taking no test.

06:24.626 --> 06:26.528
- Me and Cora stood at that
bank for three hours for them

06:26.628 --> 06:30.866
to count that $40,000 worth of
change and you gonna take it.

06:30.966 --> 06:32.567
- That's right.
- Okay.

06:32.668 --> 06:35.537
Can--can we all
just shake hands and--

06:35.637 --> 06:37.372
- I'ma just wait for
the water to get turned on

06:37.472 --> 06:39.508
before I shake his hand.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.510
- Well, I can go and call
the plumber right now.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.079
- Sounds like a good idea.
And then we can get this place

06:44.212 --> 06:46.214
all cleaned up and
painted and decorated.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.383
- LEAH: Ooh, yes!

06:48.483 --> 06:50.419

06:50.519 --> 06:53.588
Move, baby.
- Ooh! You rough!

06:53.689 --> 06:56.391
- Just give me a hug, man.
- No, don't.

06:56.491 --> 06:57.926
You stink. I don't want you
to--don't put--

06:58.026 --> 07:00.095
don't come over here touching
me. That's nasty.

07:00.228 --> 07:01.296
You still stink.

07:01.396 --> 07:02.764
- Would you stop that?

07:02.864 --> 07:05.233
- Look, guys, this
is gonna be great.

07:05.334 --> 07:06.368
I'm gonna call the plumber,

07:06.468 --> 07:08.236
see if he can start
working right now.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.538
- Yeah, you just do that.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.406
Uh, which one of these
gonna be my room?

07:11.506 --> 07:14.409
- Say what?
- What?

07:14.509 --> 07:18.246

- What?

07:18.313 --> 07:20.482
- You livin' here?
- Yeah, I got money.

07:20.582 --> 07:23.051
I gotta watch my investment.
I don't know you like that.

07:24.786 --> 07:28.290
- Oh, damn.
- What is it, Grandpa Vinny?

07:28.390 --> 07:30.392
- Y'all gonna let this
bastard live here?

07:30.492 --> 07:32.527
- CORA: Mr. Vinny--
- I know my daddy.

07:33.962 --> 07:35.364
- You see--you see what
he doing right there?

07:35.464 --> 07:36.865
And you want that in the house?

07:38.333 --> 07:40.802
I'ma tell you right now...

07:40.902 --> 07:43.205
he gonna have me in jail.

07:43.271 --> 07:44.606

07:44.706 --> 07:46.041

07:46.208 --> 07:51.313
If you feel like you want this
smoke, come on with it, then.

07:51.413 --> 07:54.583
- Okay, well, I will
come on with it.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.952
- You ain't harder than me.
- Yeah, I'm harder!

07:57.052 --> 07:59.287
- If you feel like you
want some of this smoke--

07:59.388 --> 08:00.956
- Yeah, I feel like
I want some of this.

08:01.056 --> 08:02.324
I'm feeling myself.

08:02.424 --> 08:04.693
- You can't feel yourself
more than I can feel--

08:04.793 --> 08:06.662
- Yeah, that's what I want.
I want it all.

08:06.762 --> 08:10.565
- You feel it--
- Enough! Enough!

08:10.666 --> 08:13.535
- No, no, him in here
ain't part of the deal.

08:13.635 --> 08:17.072
- My money, and my money, and
my $40,000 is part of the deal.

08:17.239 --> 08:18.907
Now jump.

08:19.007 --> 08:21.710
- No jumping, Grandpa.
You know your knees.

08:21.810 --> 08:23.945
- It's my foot gonna be
in his ass, not my knee.

08:25.681 --> 08:28.383
- Okay, y'all.
Mr. Brown, I got you.

08:28.483 --> 08:30.218
Look, we got plenty of rooms.
We gonna find you one.

08:30.319 --> 08:32.788
- You get him, 'cause I'll take
his teeth out and bite him.

08:35.524 --> 08:37.426
I just want a beautiful room.

08:37.526 --> 08:40.195
I need a nice view.
- Mm-hmm.

08:40.262 --> 08:42.197
- 'Cause I'm a "colostrophobic."

08:42.297 --> 08:43.865
- I--I--I got the
perfect room for you.

08:43.965 --> 08:47.269
- Oh, yeah.
I get clos--I just go crazy.

08:47.369 --> 08:48.337
- We don't want that.

08:48.437 --> 08:49.805
- You ever been
"colostrophobic"?

08:51.640 --> 08:54.576
I was in the elevator one time.
And I went crazy.

08:54.676 --> 08:57.479
Like, I just-- [grunts]

08:57.579 --> 08:59.047
Somebody get me!

snot out of myself.

09:05.420 --> 09:09.224
I got it on his hat.
I got it off.

09:09.324 --> 09:12.227
- I know damn well you ain't
got an old booger on my hat.

09:14.863 --> 09:16.698
- Come on, show me the room.
- Okay, yup.

09:16.798 --> 09:19.034
Baby can you, uh, call the kids

09:19.134 --> 09:21.103
and tell them to come
downstairs for dinner?

09:21.236 --> 09:22.237
- All right.

09:22.304 --> 09:24.539
- Well, -- they're not here.

09:24.639 --> 09:26.541
- Where are they?

09:26.641 --> 09:31.179
- Well, when y'alls was outside,
scrubbing down Stank Man...

09:31.279 --> 09:32.814

09:32.914 --> 09:34.483
- Grandpa Vinny,

09:34.583 --> 09:36.251
- The hell if I know.

09:36.351 --> 09:38.320
- You know what?
I'm--I'ma call her, baby.

09:38.420 --> 09:41.323
- Uh, question.

09:41.423 --> 09:44.192
While y'all dealing
with all the drama...

09:44.226 --> 09:46.495
who gonna show me to my room?

09:46.595 --> 09:48.697
- Mr. Brown, they

09:48.797 --> 09:52.934
- Cora, I don't care.
I don't know them kids.

09:53.035 --> 09:55.303
- Well, I'll help you
find a room. Come on.

09:55.404 --> 09:57.372
- How you gonna tell me what
room? You been here before?

09:57.472 --> 09:58.607
- Well, we looked around.

09:58.707 --> 10:00.042
- Cora, don't tell me
you've been creeping.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.444
- CORA: Well, maybe.

10:02.544 --> 10:05.314
- Sandra, baby,
this is your mom.

10:05.414 --> 10:07.049
Where are you?
Call me back, okay?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.954
- Let me tell you
about your kids.

10:13.055 --> 10:14.389
- Grandpa Vinny.

10:14.489 --> 10:18.260
- They don't listen
to no damn body.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.596
- They listen to us.
- No, they don't.

10:21.697 --> 10:23.999
That's why I tell you
you got to beat that ass.

10:26.768 --> 10:29.004
Beat it in the morning.

10:29.104 --> 10:31.773
Beat it in the afternoon.

10:31.873 --> 10:33.175
Beat it in the
middle of the night.

10:34.976 --> 10:38.413
Speaking of that,
I need to go to my room.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.615
If you need me,
I'll be beatin' it!

10:43.018 --> 10:45.754
- Disgusting!

10:45.854 --> 10:47.756
- Baby, where could
these kids have gone?

10:48.824 --> 10:50.192
- I don't know,
but we'll find them.

10:54.971 --> 10:56.172
- ♪

10:57.774 --> 11:00.176
- Cora, we oughta jump him.
- Mr. Brown, don't do that.

11:03.312 --> 11:05.581
- Don't worry about them doors!
They don't work anyway!

11:09.519 --> 11:12.555
- Any luck?
- No. I looked everywhere.

11:12.655 --> 11:15.224
- Did you clean up anything
while you was looking?

11:15.324 --> 11:18.161
This place is filthy.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.562
- Mr. Brown!

11:19.662 --> 11:20.663
- Where did they go?

11:20.763 --> 11:22.899
- They're headed
toward the mall.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.067
- Oh, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

11:25.168 --> 11:27.236
Wait a minute.
Why didn't you tell us that?

11:27.336 --> 11:28.805
- Because nobody asked me.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.041
- Yes, we did.

11:32.141 --> 11:33.876
- Well, you did, actually,
but I don't give a damn.

11:35.611 --> 11:39.315
- You know what?
- Them ain't my kids.

11:39.415 --> 11:42.085
I spent my whole
life avoiding kids.

11:42.185 --> 11:44.120
- Yeah, we know.

11:44.220 --> 11:46.856
- I got a pocket
full of condoms.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.792
- Look, y'all are
nuts, this is crazy.

11:49.892 --> 11:51.894
The kids, they're
grounded immediately.

11:51.994 --> 11:53.162
- Well, look, this
is the country.

11:53.262 --> 11:54.797
They can't get into no trouble.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.999
- Ah, I don't know about that.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.167
- What?

11:58.267 --> 12:02.004
- I remember when I
was about 13 years old.

12:02.105 --> 12:03.072
And then I--I--

12:03.172 --> 12:05.508
- Was grabbed, tagged,
and put in a zoo.

12:07.343 --> 12:08.678
- That--that's--you so ignorant.

12:08.778 --> 12:11.380
That ain't--this
a serious story.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.849
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.986
- Like I was saying,
I was 12 years old.

12:17.086 --> 12:20.289
- No, you weren't.
You said you was 13.

12:20.389 --> 12:23.292
- Okay, okay.
Is this your story?

12:23.392 --> 12:27.296
- No, I'm sorry.
- I was there.

12:27.396 --> 12:28.397
Hey, Cora?
- CORA: Huh?

12:28.498 --> 12:29.632
- I ain't never tell you this,

12:29.732 --> 12:31.601
but I was walking
through the jungle,

12:31.701 --> 12:33.836
and I was going
downstairs in the jungle.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.738
- Going downstairs
in the jungle?

12:35.838 --> 12:38.775
- Come on, just picture me.
Stay with me and my story.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.743
And then I went back over.
- Okay.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.012
- I went back over, and
there were some leaves.

12:43.112 --> 12:45.314
And all of a sudden, pew!

12:45.415 --> 12:48.151
- What?
- I fell!

12:48.251 --> 12:49.318
- What happened?

12:49.419 --> 12:54.023
- I fell 1,000 inches.

12:54.123 --> 12:56.959
It was a well, Cora.
- CORA: What?

12:57.026 --> 12:59.862
- I would've died if it had
not been for this old dog.

12:59.962 --> 13:02.799
- What--what dog?
- Lassie, Cora.

13:05.735 --> 13:08.271
- That's not helping this
situation, Mr. Brown.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.039
- I was so cold.

13:10.139 --> 13:12.108
All I had was a
rock and some water.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.746
And I put that rock in there.

13:16.846 --> 13:19.015
And I made rock soup.

13:19.115 --> 13:20.483
- That's it.
I'm calling the police.

13:20.583 --> 13:21.651
- No need.
I already called.

13:21.751 --> 13:24.454
- No, no, no.
Y'all--y'all need to relax.

13:24.554 --> 13:29.325
It's just them damn kids.
Who the hell cares?

13:29.425 --> 13:30.793
And it's the country.
I mean,

13:30.893 --> 13:32.195
they can't get
in no trouble here.

13:32.295 --> 13:33.863
- Ah!
- Mr. Vinny!

13:33.996 --> 13:36.132
- That's what my daddy thought.

13:36.232 --> 13:39.836
And then, when I fell in that
well, I didn't tell y'all...

13:40.002 --> 13:41.270
people were dead in there.

13:43.005 --> 13:45.541
People have woke up dead!
- Would you stop it?

13:45.641 --> 13:48.878
- But I--I'm alive.
You see I'm alive.

13:49.011 --> 13:51.380
I could've been dead.
- Mr. Brown, would you stop?

13:51.481 --> 13:54.350
- Cora, I could've been
dead, sleeping in my grave.

13:54.450 --> 13:55.518
But the Lord saw fit--

13:55.618 --> 13:57.820
- [front door opens]
- [doorbell rings]

13:57.954 --> 14:00.123
- What's going on?
And where's his hook?

14:02.225 --> 14:03.226
- Don't worry about that.

14:03.326 --> 14:04.460
We were looking for
you and your sister.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.828
- I was at the mall.

14:05.962 --> 14:07.764
- Did you ask somebody if
you could go somewhere, boy!?

14:07.864 --> 14:10.566
- Look, look, I was
just following Sandra!

14:10.666 --> 14:12.468
- Well, where is she?
- I don't know.

14:12.568 --> 14:14.036
I thought she'd be here.

14:14.137 --> 14:16.105
- What do you mean?
You said you were following her.

14:16.205 --> 14:18.241
- She got in a car
with the bus driver.

14:18.341 --> 14:19.809
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

14:19.976 --> 14:21.244
- Wait a minute, son.

14:21.344 --> 14:23.246
Now, you said she got
in the car with who?

14:23.346 --> 14:25.114
- Uh, our bus driver.

14:25.214 --> 14:26.716
- And who is he?

14:26.816 --> 14:28.451
- I don't know.
We just met him this morning.

14:28.551 --> 14:29.619
- Oh, Lord.

14:29.719 --> 14:31.053
- Okay, wait, I'm
calling the police again.

14:31.154 --> 14:33.022
- No, no, no, no, no, hold up.
Don't do that.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.090
- Why?

14:34.190 --> 14:36.526
- The bus driver is
the sheriff's son.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.261
- Okay, and how old is he?

14:38.361 --> 14:39.829
- Eighteen.

14:39.996 --> 14:41.397
- All right, well,
my daughter is 17

14:41.497 --> 14:43.065
and she's not
supposed to be out.

14:43.166 --> 14:45.635
- Well, then, just let me
call the sheriff, okay?

14:47.336 --> 14:49.138
- That's why she's so happy.
She running around here happy

14:49.238 --> 14:51.274
'cause she running around
with some boy, huh?

14:53.409 --> 14:55.945
- Well...
- Well what?

14:56.012 --> 14:57.814
- You kind of were doing
the same thing--ooh!

14:57.947 --> 14:59.382
- Now is not the time!

14:59.482 --> 15:01.651
- It was never
the time for that.

15:01.751 --> 15:04.387
- You just don't know
when to be quiet, do you?

15:04.487 --> 15:05.822
- I'm just saying.

15:05.955 --> 15:07.323
- Hey, Sheriff, how
you doing, baby?

15:08.724 --> 15:10.059
You all right?

15:10.159 --> 15:11.961
What you wearing?

15:12.028 --> 15:13.963
- Grandpa Vinny, I thought
you were calling a sheriff.

15:15.531 --> 15:18.267
- Oh-ho, I thought
you said Cheryl.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.802
- Oh, my god.

15:19.969 --> 15:21.838
- Girl, I'll call you back.
Stay naked.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.541
- That's it.
I'm calling the police.

15:25.641 --> 15:28.177

15:32.648 --> 15:33.750
- Shh!

15:33.850 --> 15:36.152
- Shush is for the ears,
not the eyes, Cora.

15:36.252 --> 15:37.520
- What?

15:37.620 --> 15:39.489

- MR. BROWN: What?

15:43.993 --> 15:47.563
- I bought in 50%,
so it is my business.

15:47.663 --> 15:50.700
- Well, can you give
me 100% of shut up?

15:50.800 --> 15:51.868
- [doorbell rings]
- Oh, here she comes.

15:52.001 --> 15:54.237
Cora, here she comes.

15:54.337 --> 15:57.940
Ooh, this 'bout to be good.
Don't you love

- Will you stop that?

16:01.477 --> 16:02.845
- She don't even know it.

16:02.945 --> 16:05.481
She don't know she
gonna get a whoop--

16:05.581 --> 16:06.983
- We can hear you.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.085
- Oh, I'm not whispering?

16:09.185 --> 16:10.219
- No.

16:10.319 --> 16:11.788
- [whispers]
She gonna get a whooping.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.157
- Hi.

16:14.257 --> 16:15.458
- Baby!

16:15.558 --> 16:16.959
Ooh!

16:18.628 --> 16:20.229
Sandra?

16:20.329 --> 16:22.231
- Yes?

16:22.331 --> 16:24.467
- Where have you been?

16:24.567 --> 16:29.105
- Well, I was doing my homework,
and then I went to the mall.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.973
- Uh, who says you
can go to the mall?

16:31.074 --> 16:34.844
- Mm.
- Well, I never asked back home.

16:34.977 --> 16:37.380
- Yeah, that's when we
were three blocks away.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.681
We're not home.

16:38.781 --> 16:39.982
- Well, I didn't think
it would mean anything--

16:40.049 --> 16:42.652
- Were you with a boy!?

16:42.752 --> 16:44.987
- Yeah.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.056
I got to go change my underwear.

16:50.493 --> 16:51.861
- Streaked them up.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.265
- Are you gonna lie to me?
Were you with a boy?

16:56.365 --> 16:58.734
- Now--now technically,
it was man.

16:58.835 --> 17:00.570
- Mr. Brown...

17:00.670 --> 17:03.372
- Cora, you hurt my nipple.

17:03.473 --> 17:05.341
You got the Holy Ghost?

17:05.441 --> 17:08.277
- Are you about to lie to me?
- I wasn't.

17:08.377 --> 17:09.712
- Sandra?

17:09.812 --> 17:11.414
- Is that what he said?

17:11.514 --> 17:14.684
- I'm--I'm just standing here.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.719
Look, I just told
them what I saw.

17:16.819 --> 17:19.956
- Look, we need to
talk to you, okay?

17:20.056 --> 17:22.992
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm. Come on.

17:23.092 --> 17:24.994
- Ooh.
- She about to get a whooping.

17:26.729 --> 17:28.331
- Now.

17:28.431 --> 17:30.166
- Hey, look, girl.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.334
- What?

17:31.434 --> 17:33.136
- I wouldn't go over
there if I was you.

17:33.236 --> 17:34.704
- Mr. Brown!
- What, Cora?

17:34.804 --> 17:36.339
They about to tear her tail up.

17:36.439 --> 17:37.807
- Go and talk to your
parents, sweetheart.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.609
- Don't go and talk to
your parents, sweetheart.

17:39.709 --> 17:41.344
- What are you doing?

17:41.444 --> 17:42.812
Go on and talk to
your parents, baby.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.881
- Don't do it.
- Don't confuse her.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.417
Go talk to them.
- Don't talk to them.

17:47.517 --> 17:48.518
- CORA: Go on, girl.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.288
- Cora!
- What?

17:52.388 --> 17:53.756
- Wait, I thought
you was a Christian.

17:53.923 --> 17:55.158
- I am a Christian.

17:55.258 --> 17:57.593
- Well, why are you sending
a lamb off to the slaughter?

17:57.693 --> 17:59.395
- She shouldn't have lied.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.497
- Now you in they business.

18:01.597 --> 18:03.833
- Well, suffer the little
children to come unto me.

18:03.933 --> 18:05.735
And she needs some
suffering today.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.037
'Cause I would
tear that tail up.

18:08.137 --> 18:09.605
- Cora, you don't
know how to whoop.

18:09.705 --> 18:11.240
- Yes, I do.
- Show me how you whoop.

18:12.308 --> 18:13.776
Cora, you can't--
you about to have--

18:13.943 --> 18:15.445
- Madea used to kick me.

18:15.545 --> 18:16.946
She used to do everything.

18:16.979 --> 18:18.414
- That's child abuse.

18:20.450 --> 18:23.553
- Don't talk when
grown people talking.

18:23.653 --> 18:25.288
Or you gonna be abused.
- Right.

18:25.388 --> 18:28.558
- And it didn't become
child abuse until 1984.

18:29.959 --> 18:32.261
Before that, it was
whooping the tail.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.363
