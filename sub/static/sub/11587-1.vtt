WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:03.137
- PREVIOUSLY ON LAW AND ORDER:
SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT...

00:03.171 --> 00:04.405
- BACHELOR PARTY GONE WRONG.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.674
VICTIM'S
AN UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.243
- DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS 16?

00:09.277 --> 00:10.811
- MAY I ASK WHAT YOU
WERE DOING THERE

00:10.844 --> 00:12.313
WHEN YOU DISCOVERED THE BODY?

00:12.346 --> 00:14.615
- I'M AN ESCORT.
I GET PAID TO GO TO PARTIES.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.417
- WHO IS SHE WORKING FOR?

00:16.450 --> 00:17.785
- SHE'S ONE OF DELIA WILSON'S
TOP GIRLS.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.453
TILL GANZEL TOOK HER AWAY.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.289
- DELIA WILSON
IS NEW YORK CITY'S

00:21.322 --> 00:23.157
MOST NOTORIOUS MADAM.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.059
- CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT YOUR ESCORT AGENCY?

00:25.093 --> 00:26.494
- IT'S A MATCHMAKING SERVICE.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.796
- YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TEMPTED?

00:28.829 --> 00:31.465
- NO.
- AH.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.301
- SO WHY IS DELIA GOING
AFTER GANZEL?

00:33.334 --> 00:34.802
- HE'S GOT THE HOTTEST GIRLS.

00:34.835 --> 00:37.138
SHE'S GOT THE MOST HIGH-POWERED
CLIENT LIST.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.472
- THOSE GIRLS HAVE
OTHER CLIENTS.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.342
POLITICIANS, D.A.s, BRASS.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.812
- DELIA STARTED A WAR.
HE'S STRIKING BACK.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.181
- A FORMER GOVERNOR
WAS MURDERED.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.516
- I'M NOT TAKING THE FALL
FOR THIS.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.151
- YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.153
NOBODY KNOWS HOW DEEP
HER HOOKS GO.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.188
- THIS WAS SLID
UNDER MY APARTMENT DOOR.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.823
- WHEN YOU WERE UNDERCOVER.
THIS IS COMPLETELY LEGIT.

00:55.856 --> 00:59.160
- YOU KNOW
WHERE THIS GOES, LIV.

01:08.136 --> 01:11.205
- IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM, SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES

01:11.239 --> 01:13.541
ARE CONSIDERED
ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.809
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

01:15.843 --> 01:17.845
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

01:17.878 --> 01:19.247
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

01:19.280 --> 01:21.349
KNOWN AS THE SPECIAL
VICTIMS UNIT.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.318
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.354
[cell phone vibrating]

01:34.428 --> 01:36.897
- BENSON.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.234
CAPTAIN.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.642
- SO YOU PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET
THE BIG PICTURE, DO YOU?

01:48.676 --> 01:50.344
- WHICH IS WHAT?

01:50.378 --> 01:52.513
- DELIA WILSON HAS THE GOODS
ON EVERYONE YOU WORK FOR.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.549
EVERYONE YOU WILL EVER CONSIDER
WORKING FOR.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.818
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW DEEP THIS GOES.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.820
- WE'LL DO OUR JOB.
YOU DO YOURS.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.256
- RIGHT, YOU AND YOUR
D.A. FRIEND, HADEN?

02:02.290 --> 02:04.725
YOU'RE IN THIS WAY
OVER YOUR HEAD, SWEETHEART.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.927
WALK AWAY, LITTLE PEOPLE.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.596
- NOW WATCH YOURSELF, COUNSELOR.

02:08.629 --> 02:09.930
- YEAH. AND YOU...

02:09.963 --> 02:13.201
YOU THINK YOUR MARRIAGE
IS ROCKY NOW, KIDDO?

02:13.234 --> 02:14.602
JUST WAIT TILL YOUR WIFE
FINDS OUT

02:14.635 --> 02:17.171
ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR STAR WITNESS.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.175
- YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER ASKED YOU
WHAT YOU AND CARISSA

02:21.209 --> 02:23.911
TALKED ABOUT THAT NIGHT
IN THE STRIP CLUB.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.280
- YOU CHECKING MY WORK?

02:26.314 --> 02:28.949
EXLEY'S HAD SVU IN HIS SIGHTS
SINCE THE DISTASIO CASE.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.319
AND IF HE DID HEAR ANYTHING
ABOUT ME AND CARISSA,

02:31.352 --> 02:32.653
IT CAME FROM YOUR BUDDY.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.255
- CASSIDY WOULDN'T DO THAT.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.890
- RIGHT. I NEVER ASKED YOU
ABOUT DAVID HADEN.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.228
AND I KNEW FROM THE GET.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.831
- NICK--
- YOU PUT IT OUT THERE, NOT ME.

02:43.864 --> 02:48.202
I NEED SOME AIR.
I'M GONNA WALK.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.503
- I TRIED TO WARN YOU.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.673
I TOLD YOU,
EVERYBODY'S GOT A SKELETON.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.276
IN THIS INVESTIGATION,
THEY GOT TAPS ON COPS.

02:55.309 --> 02:59.280
THE D.A.'S OFFICE--I MEAN,
ALL THE WAY UP TO HADEN,

02:59.313 --> 03:02.550
THAT SELF-RIGHTEOUS ASS-HAT.

03:02.583 --> 03:06.220
- WHO ELSE?

03:06.254 --> 03:10.891
IS THERE ANYTHING
I SHOULD KNOW?

03:10.924 --> 03:12.793
IS IT CRAGEN?

03:12.826 --> 03:13.961
- THE CAPTAIN.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.497
- NO GAMES.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.966
IS HE INVOLVED IN THIS?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.534
- HIS NAME HAS COME UP
ON SOME LISTS.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.537
YOU KNOW...
MAYBE HE'S INVOLVED.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.005
MAYBE HE'S BEING SET UP.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.807
I REALLY DON'T KNOW, LIV.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.811
I DON'T.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.646
- IF I TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S DEATH,

03:32.680 --> 03:34.482
CAN YOU PROTECT ME?

03:34.515 --> 03:36.550
- WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME?

03:36.584 --> 03:40.988
WERE YOU THERE?

03:41.021 --> 03:42.523
- YOU ALREADY KNOW
THERE'S A WAR GOING ON

03:42.556 --> 03:44.592
BETWEEN GANZEL AND DELIA.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.361
MAGGIE GOT CAUGHT,
THE GOVERNOR.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.596
I THINK I'M NEXT.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.731
- LOOK, WE CAN PROTECT YOU.

03:50.764 --> 03:51.999
COME INSIDE WITH ME
RIGHT NOW.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.501
I'LL TAKE YOUR STATEMENT--

03:53.534 --> 03:55.969
- UH...

03:56.003 --> 03:58.639
I THINK I SHOULD GO.
UM, THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.809
- HEY, CARISSA.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.613
JUST TAKE MY CARD, AT LEAST.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.923
JUST CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.157
ANYTIME.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.630
- IT'S LATE.

04:22.663 --> 04:23.997
LONG SHIFT?

04:24.031 --> 04:25.866
[cell phone buzzing]

04:25.899 --> 04:28.936
- THIS IS WHY I HAVEN'T
BEEN COMING HOME.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.639
- YOU SAID WE COULD
TALK TONIGHT.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.408
- AMARO.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.043
UH, CARISSA--

04:36.076 --> 04:38.479
WAIT, SLOW DOWN.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.947
WELL, THEN, DON'T STAY.
GET OUT OF THERE.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.450
- WHO'S CARISSA?
- SHE'S A WITNESS.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.886
- YOU CAN TALK TO HER,
BUT YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.922
- LOOK, I HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.028
[sighs]

04:55.062 --> 04:57.665
WHAT?

04:57.698 --> 05:00.901
- JUST MAKE YOUR PHONE CALL.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.871
- THANK YOU FOR MEETING ME.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.907
- YOU LEFT FOUR MESSAGES
AT THE PRECINCT.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.109
I FIGURED IT WAS IMPORTANT.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.913
- I FEEL LIKE
I CAN TRUST YOU.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.982
I WENT TO DETECTIVE
AMARO EARLIER,

05:15.015 --> 05:16.617
OUTSIDE THE POLICE STATION.

05:16.650 --> 05:21.522
I TOLD HIM
THAT I WAS AFRAID.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.956
HE SAID THAT
HE COULD PROTECT ME

05:22.990 --> 05:27.861
IF I WENT TO A HOTEL
WITH HIM.

05:27.895 --> 05:31.699
[cell phone ringing]

05:31.732 --> 05:33.734
- TOP POCKET.

05:33.767 --> 05:37.505
- [sighs] LEAVE THE ROOM.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.039
- LET'S GO, COME ON.
CHOP-CHOP.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.007
- SWEETHEART?

05:45.946 --> 05:48.949
- CAPTAIN?

05:48.982 --> 05:51.985
YOU FORGOT YOUR KEYS.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.992
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.895
OKAY.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.067
IT'S OKAY.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.441
- I CALLED 911.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

06:13.474 --> 06:18.045
I DIDN'T TOUCH A THING.

06:18.078 --> 06:21.081
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

06:24.585 --> 06:27.588
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.046
- IT'S CARISSA.

07:26.079 --> 07:29.216
- I WOKE UP.
SHE WAS DEAD.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.184
BLOOD EVERYWHERE.

07:31.218 --> 07:35.088
LIV, I DON'T REMEMBER
HOW SHE GOT HERE.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.156
[knock at door]
- POLICE.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.825
- IN THE BEDROOM.

07:37.858 --> 07:41.795
DON'T SAY ANYTHING UNTIL
YOUR LAWYER GETS HERE.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.631
DETECTIVE BENSON,
SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.965
- IT'S NOT YOUR CASE,
DETECTIVE.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.600
I NEED YOU TO WAIT OUTSIDE.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.743
- CAPTAIN CRAGEN,

07:55.776 --> 07:58.912
DID YOU KNOW THE VICTIM?

07:58.946 --> 08:00.714
- YES.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.516
CARISSA GIBSON.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.185
SHE WAS A WITNESS IN AN SVU
MURDER INVESTIGATION.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.522
- I GOTTA GO.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.258
CAPTAIN, ARE YOU OKAY?

08:11.291 --> 08:12.860
- YEAH, JUST A LITTLE TENSE.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.728
THEY HAVE TO GET ME
TO THE HOSPITAL.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.296
- HE NEEDS TO SEE A DOCTOR.
I'M GOING TO RIDE WITH HIM.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.733
- I THINK YOU KNOW BETTER
THAN THAT, DETECTIVE BENSON.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.569
- EXCUSE ME.
YOU ARE...

08:21.602 --> 08:23.704
- PAULA FOSTER, D.A.'S
PUBLIC INTEGRITY UNIT.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.173
AND THIS IS MY INVESTIGATION,
NOT SVU'S.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.543
- FOUND THIS, COUNSELOR,
IN THE BATHROOM SINK.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.044
- I WAS TOLD THAT YOU WERE
ALREADY ON THE CRIME SCENE

08:31.078 --> 08:32.580
WHEN OFFICERS ARRIVED.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.047
DID YOU SEE THAT KNIFE?
TOUCH ANYTHING?

08:34.081 --> 08:35.315
- I KNOW BETTER THAN THAT.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.150
- THEN YOU KNOW BETTER
THAN TO INTERFERE--

08:37.184 --> 08:39.019
- HE'S BEEN MY CAPTAIN
FOR 14 YEARS.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.689
- I DON'T CARE.
WHATEVER YOU TWO TALKED ABOUT,

08:41.722 --> 08:43.691
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TESTIFY TO
AT HIS GRAND JURY.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.325
HE CAN TAKE FIVE,
YOU CAN'T.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.127
- I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.296
- SO, ANYTHING YOU WANNA
TELL ME?

08:49.329 --> 08:50.631
- YES.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.199
HE DIDN'T DO THIS.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.768
[siren wailing]

08:57.237 --> 08:58.739
- SO HE DOESN'T REMEMBER

08:58.772 --> 09:00.774
ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT?

09:00.808 --> 09:03.276
- BARELY REMEMBERS
THE LAST FEW DAYS.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.912
- HE MUST'VE BEEN DRUGGED.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.214
I MEAN, THINGS COULD COME BACK
TO HIM IN PIECES.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.249
- NO, I MEAN,
I CALLED CAPTAIN'S ENDOWMENT.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.918
THEY'RE SENDING OVER
COUNSEL AT LEAST.

09:10.951 --> 09:15.055
CSU SAID THERE'S NO SIGN
OF FORCED ENTRY.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.924
MAYBE CARISSA
TALKED HER WAY IN.

09:16.957 --> 09:17.991
SLIPPED HIM A ROOFIE.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.093
- SLIT HER OWN THROAT.

09:21.795 --> 09:26.199
LOOK, SHE...CALLED ME
A FEW TIMES LAST NIGHT.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.269
SHE WAS ANXIOUS. SHE THOUGHT
SHE WAS IN SOMEONE'S CROSSHAIRS.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.238
- WHOSE?

09:31.271 --> 09:33.040
- SHE DIDN'T SAY.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.909
BUT IT TURNS OUT SHE HAD
A RIGHT TO BE SCARED.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.878
- OF OUR CAPTAIN?
SERIOUSLY?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.947
- I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.715
- HE WAS DRUGGED.
WE WEREN'T THERE.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.216
NONE OF US KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.818
- NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED, BUT I--

09:44.852 --> 09:47.655
- DETECTIVES AND OFFICERS,
YOUR ATTENTION.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.089
STEVEN HARRIS--
I'VE BEEN ASSIGNED

09:49.122 --> 09:50.758
TEMPORARY CAPTAIN
OF SPECIAL VICTIMS.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.259
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.828
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL CONCERNED
ABOUT CAPTAIN CRAGEN.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.931
HERE'S THE REALITY:
SVU CAN'T TOUCH THIS.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.734
WHAT WE CAN DO IS ACCEPT
WHAT WE CAN'T CHANGE

10:00.768 --> 10:02.803
AND GO ABOUT
OUR REGULAR BUSINESS.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.005
FAIR OR NOT, EYES ARE GOING
TO BE ON US.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.374
SO I'M GONNA NEED TO SEE
YOUR MEMO BOOKS,

10:07.407 --> 10:09.242
LOGS OF EVERY MILE
YOU DRIVE--

10:09.276 --> 10:11.812
- CAPTAIN,
NO DISRESPECT, BUT...

10:11.845 --> 10:13.881
HERE IN SVU, WE'RE--

10:13.914 --> 10:15.248
WE'RE USED TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF AUTONOMY.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.250
- I UNDERSTAND.
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.886
WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE
TO ADJUST.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.287
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN--

10:20.320 --> 10:21.989
- PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.224
- BUT THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT
KIND OF SQUAD.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.392
- I CONSIDER THIS TO BE ONE

10:25.425 --> 10:27.828
OF THE DEPARTMENT'S
ELITE SQUADS.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.196
I DON'T WANNA
SEE IT BROKEN UP.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.398
- OKAY. WE GOT YOU, CAPTAIN.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.966
- GOOD.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.267
WHILE WE'RE AT IT,
LAST I CHECKED

10:34.301 --> 10:36.269
NYPD DRESS CODE
IS BUSINESS ATTIRE.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.339
- I THINK THIS UNIT'S GOT BIGGER
ISSUES THAN THAT.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.742
- DETECTIVES,
THIS IS PAULA FOSTER,

10:41.775 --> 10:44.277
HEAD OF THE D.A.'S PUBLIC
INTEGRITY UNIT.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.946
- THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.716
AS YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD,
I WILL BE TAKING OVER

10:48.749 --> 10:50.951
THE CARISSA GIBSON MURDER
INVESTIGATION.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.220
I AM HERE TO REMIND YOU
THAT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

10:53.253 --> 10:55.856
AND TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE
ARE CRIMES.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.326
AS YOU ARE POTENTIAL WITNESSES,
IT'S IN YOUR BEST INTEREST

10:59.359 --> 11:01.228
NOT TO DISCUSS THIS CASE
WITH EACH OTHER,

11:01.261 --> 11:02.429
OR WITH ANYONE ELSE.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.997
- NOT EVEN THE PRESS?

11:04.031 --> 11:07.000
- YOU WILL BE ASKED
IN THE GRAND JURY

11:07.034 --> 11:08.201
WHO YOU SPOKE WITH,
AND WHEN,

11:08.235 --> 11:10.370
AND I WILL BE QUESTIONING
ALL OF YOU

11:10.403 --> 11:13.240
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE SUSPECT.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.378
AND THE VICTIM.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.848
I WILL EXPECT
YOUR FULL COOPERATION.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.083
- COUNSELOR.
A WORD?

11:24.084 --> 11:25.085
- WALK ME OUT.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.353
- WE GOT A CALL.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.355
FROM SECURITY AT THE PARK
MILANO HOTEL.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.258
IN-HOUSE MASSEUR CLAIMS
A CELEBRITY GUEST

11:31.291 --> 11:32.960
GRABBED THE MASSEUR'S GENITALS

11:32.993 --> 11:35.495
WHILE REQUESTING
A "REVERSE MASSAGE."

11:35.528 --> 11:37.998
WHO'S GOT THIS?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.132
DETECTIVES FINN AND MUNCH.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.168
- SERGEANT MUNCH.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.237
- THANK YOU FOR VOLUNTEERING,
SERGEANT.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.306
- SVU HAS BEEN
INVESTIGATING A WAR

11:46.339 --> 11:48.308
BETWEEN DELIA WILSON
AND BART GANZEL.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.143
- I'M MORE THAN UP TO SPEED
ON THAT.

11:50.177 --> 11:54.414
- AND OUR TAKE IS THAT CRAGEN
IS THE LATEST CASUALTY.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.983
HE'S BEEN SET UP.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.786
- MAYBE. BUT MY CONCERN
IS THE OPTICS.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.253
I HAVE TO REASSURE THE CITY
AND THE MAJOR

12:00.287 --> 12:03.056
THAT NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW,
NOT EVEN YOUR CAPTAIN.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.224
- HE DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.226
- IF THAT'S TRUE,
WE'LL FIND OUT.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.261
BUT HE'S GOT BLOOD
ON HIS HANDS.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.130
AND EVERYONE ELSE IS GOING
TO BE FIGURING OUT

12:10.163 --> 12:12.499
HOW TO SCORE POINTS
OR COVER THEIR ASS.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.401
- INCLUDING YOU?

12:14.434 --> 12:17.070
- I'VE BEEN RUNNING PUBLIC
INTEGRITY FOR SEVEN YEARS,

12:17.104 --> 12:18.939
AND YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF ME.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.207
I DON'T LIKE PUBLICITY.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.508
I LIKE MY JOB.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.911
I'M NOT GUNNING FOR ANYTHING.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.278
- FAIR ENOUGH.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.381
- AND I KNOW, NO MATTER
WHAT CAPTAIN HARRIS SAYS,

12:28.415 --> 12:31.118
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO STAY AWAY
FROM THIS.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.220
- LISTEN, I'M NOT GONNA
INTERFERE WITH YOUR--

12:33.253 --> 12:34.354
- DON'T EVEN TRY.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.289
ALL I ASK:

12:36.323 --> 12:40.160
WHATEVER YOU FIND, TELL ME.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.461
YOU KNOW PEOPLE
IN THE D.A.'S OFFICE.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.430
VET ME ALL YOU WANT.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.833
I'M NO ONE'S FRIEND,

12:45.866 --> 12:47.500
BUT I HAVE
EVERYONE'S RESPECT.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.873
- I WILL.

12:52.906 --> 12:57.110
AND I'M ASKING YOU,
BEFORE YOU RUSH TO JUDGMENT,

12:57.144 --> 12:59.446
TO VET MY CAPTAIN.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.148
- I'M GOING TO MEET HIM
RIGHT NOW.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.017
[elevator dings]

13:07.520 --> 13:10.023
I'LL NEED PHOTOS
OF THESE SCRATCHES.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.430
- YOU CAN TURN AROUND NOW,
CAPTAIN.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.369
AND REMOVE YOUR GOWN.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.210
AND I'LL NEED YOU
TO DROP YOUR SHORTS.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.222
- YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE?
SOME FOOD?

13:42.255 --> 13:45.358
- I'D LIKE MY OWN CLOTHES.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.094
- I'LL PICK YOU UP
SOME MORE THINGS.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.362
YOU KNOW, YOUR APARTMENT'S
A CRIME SCENE.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.398
- COUNSELOR, I'VE BEEN A COP
SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN.

13:51.431 --> 13:54.902
I KNOW THE DAMN RULES.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.104
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING, I...

13:57.137 --> 13:59.239
HAD A PERSONAL EMERGENCY.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.340
MY DAUGHTER.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.341
NOT A PROBLEM.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.210
- OKAY.

14:03.243 --> 14:06.880
THEN LET'S BEGIN.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.582
CAN YOU I.D. YOURSELF FOR ME,
PLEASE?

14:09.616 --> 14:12.119
- CAPTAIN DONALD CRAGEN,
COMMANDING OFFICER

14:12.152 --> 14:14.387
OF MANHATTAN'S SPECIAL
VICTIMS UNIT.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.656
- AND LET'S START
WITH MONDAY NIGHT.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.091
ACCORDING TO YOUR PHONE RECORDS,

14:18.125 --> 14:21.394
YOU CALLED CARISSA GIBSON
AT 9:50.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.064
- YES, SHE HAD LEFT
SOME MESSAGES FOR ME

14:24.097 --> 14:25.365
AT THE SQUAD ROOM.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.633
- AND THE NATURE
OF YOUR CONVERSATION?

14:26.666 --> 14:28.635
- SHE SAID SHE HAD
SOME INFORMATION

14:28.668 --> 14:30.370
ABOUT GOVERNOR FLETCHER'S
MURDER.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.406
ASKED IF SHE COULD MEET ME
AT A DINER IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.643
- DO YOU OFTEN MEET FEMALE
WITNESSES IN RESTAURANTS

14:36.676 --> 14:37.644
LATE AT NIGHT?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.379
- NO.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.113
- DID IT OCCUR TO YOU TO ASK

14:40.147 --> 14:42.082
A FEMALE OFFICER
TO GO WITH YOU?

14:42.115 --> 14:45.485
- SHE SAID IT HAD TO BE
JUST ME, ALONE.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.288
- I SEE.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.290
HAD YOU EVER TALKED
TO HER BEFORE?

14:50.323 --> 14:51.391
- NOT PERSONALLY, NO.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.160
MY DETECTIVES DID.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.195
- WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE CALLED YOU?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.931
- WELL, GEE, IN HINDSIGHT,
I'M GONNA SAY,

14:57.965 --> 15:00.467
I THINK SHE WAS SETTING ME UP.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.569
- CAPTAIN CRAGEN MEANT
NO OFFENSE.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.304
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
HE'S UNDER STRESS.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.474
- WHEN YOU MET CARISSA,
WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU

15:07.507 --> 15:10.277
ABOUT THE FORMER
GOVERNOR'S MURDER?

15:10.310 --> 15:12.345
- NOTHING I REMEMBER.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.414
- AND YOU HAD DRINKS, SO WE'LL
BE INTERVIEWING THE BARTENDER.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.283
- HE WAS A WAITER.
I HAD A TEA.

15:16.316 --> 15:20.220
- SO YOU DO REMEMBER SOMETHING.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.488
ONCE MORE.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.324
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT?

15:24.357 --> 15:26.493
- SHE CLAIMED
ONE OF MY DETECTIVES

15:26.526 --> 15:29.296
HAD BEEN
INAPPROPRIATE WITH HER.

15:29.329 --> 15:33.733
- AND WHO WAS THAT?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.069
I'LL NEED HIS NAME,
CAPTAIN.

15:43.210 --> 15:47.247
- NICK AMARO. BUT I DIDN'T
BELIEVE A WORD SHE SAID.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.317
- CRAGEN'S BEEN SET UP,

15:50.350 --> 15:54.321
AND WE'RE CHASING CELEBRITY
CROTCH GRABBERS.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.556
- HEY, WERE YOU HERE WHEN
CASSIDY WAS AROUND?

15:56.589 --> 15:58.658
- ME? I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE
THE DAWN OF TIME.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.994
HE WAS MY PARTNER.
YOU CAN TRUST HIM.

16:01.028 --> 16:06.699
- RIGHT. BUT THE REASON I ASK
IS, I WAS INVITED

16:06.733 --> 16:08.335
TO PUBLIC INTEGRITY
FOR QUESTIONING

16:08.368 --> 16:10.003
ABOUT CARISSA'S MURDER,
AND I'M WONDERING

16:10.037 --> 16:11.738
WHO PUT ME
ON THAT SHORT LIST?

16:11.771 --> 16:13.573
- YOU SPOKE TO HER THAT NIGHT.
THEY'RE GONNA BE ALL OVER YOU.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.242
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

16:15.275 --> 16:16.343
- NOTHING, MAN. TAKE IT EASY,
WILL YOU, NICK?

16:16.376 --> 16:18.078
- LOOK, MUNCH...

16:18.111 --> 16:19.712
THERE MAY BE MORE BETWEEN
CASSIDY AND CARISSA

16:19.746 --> 16:21.281
THAN HE LETS ON.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.382
- HEY. I'LL SEE WHAT
I CAN FIND OUT.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.251
ALL RIGHT, KID?

16:28.188 --> 16:29.489
[slams door]

16:29.522 --> 16:34.394
- CASSIDY. CASSIDY,
YOU LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.396
- NO, I DON'T.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.098
YOU LOOK GOOD, JOHNNY.
- NO, I DON'T.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.100
- HEY, LIV.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.234
SO HOW'S THE CAPTAIN?

16:41.268 --> 16:43.136
- KEEPING IT TOGETHER.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.273
- WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY CARISSA WENT TO SEE HIM.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.308
DO YOU THINK SHE KNOWS SOMETHING
ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S MURDER?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.577
- MY WORKING THEORY?
SHE DID IT.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.279
- FOR GANZEL?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.381
- I DON'T HAVE PROOF,
BUT THAT NIGHT

16:54.414 --> 16:57.084
SHE WASN'T AT THE LOFT,
AND GANZEL,

16:57.117 --> 16:59.186
HE WAS ACTING REAL SQUIRRELY,
EVEN FOR HIM.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.255
- ANY WAY HE CLEANED HOUSE?
TOOK CARISSA OUT?

17:02.289 --> 17:05.225
- NAH-AH, NO WAY.
NOT A CHANCE. ZERO.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.127
I MEAN, HE WAS GENUINELY
IN LOVE WITH HER.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.329
HE'S A WRECK.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.064
- OKAY. WHO DID IT?

17:11.098 --> 17:13.300
- MY MONEY'S ON DELIA.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.768
LOOK. SHE FRAMES CRAGEN,
HURTS GANZEL...

17:15.802 --> 17:17.370
IT'S A TWOFER.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.072
- THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID
THAT CRAGEN'S NAME

17:19.106 --> 17:22.142
CAME UP ON THE WIRETAP.

17:22.175 --> 17:25.645
IS HE ONE OF THE TARGETS
ON YOUR UNDERCOVER OP?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.547
- NO.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.650
AND DON'T ASK ME WHO IS.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.420
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T DISCUSS
CRAGEN'S CASE WITH YOU.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.622
- DON'T WALK AWAY
AND MAKE ME READ THIS.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.258
- OFF THE RECORD.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.361
HIS TOX SCREEN SHOWED A HIGH
CONCENTRATION OF ALCOHOL.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.463
- CAPTAIN HASN'T HAD A DRINK
IN 20 YEARS.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.497
THEY HAD TO DOPE HIM.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.665
YOU CHECKED FOR SCOPOLAMINE?

17:45.698 --> 17:47.600
- AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.370
- WHAT ABOUT GEORGIA HOMEBOY?
G.H.B. WOULD'VE KNOCKED HIM OUT.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.373
- AND 10 HOURS LATER,
WOULDN'T LEAVE A TRACE.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.309
ALL I CAN CONFIRM
IS WHAT DID LEAVE A TRACE.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.711
CRAGEN'S D.N.A. UNDER
THE VICTIM'S FINGERNAILS,

17:58.745 --> 18:02.782
HIS PRINTS ON THE KNIFE,
AND HER SALIVA ON HIS PENIS.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.517
- ALL THAT PROVES
IS WHOEVER SET HIM UP

18:04.551 --> 18:07.254
KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

18:07.287 --> 18:11.458
- HEY, HOW ABOUT IF I'M
THE DRAGON THIS TIME, HUH?

18:11.491 --> 18:13.360
- NO, DADDY,
YOU'RE THE PRINCE.

18:13.393 --> 18:18.665
[doorbell buzzing]

18:18.698 --> 18:20.400
- I DON'T HAVE BLUE EYES.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.334
- YOU HAVE A VISITOR.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.804
- YOU MUST BE ZARA.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.174
- ALL RIGHT, HONEY, COME ON.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.508
HERE YOU GO.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.610
YEAH, IT'S TIME
TO PUT ON YOUR JAMMIES, HUH?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.312
- GOOD NIGHT, DADDY.
- YOUR DAUGHTER'S LOVELY.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.147
- YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT
MY DAUGHTER.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.182
- I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.
- YOU DON'T LOOK AT HER--

18:35.215 --> 18:36.683
- YOU'RE A STRAIGHT-UP GUY.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.685
IF YOU WERE A COP WHO CROSSES
THE LINE, I'D KNOW.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.420
- I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU KNOW.
YOU DON'T COME TO MY HOUSE.

18:40.453 --> 18:44.757
- YOU ARE BEING PLAYED
BY GANZEL AND CASSIDY.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.795
NOT THE FIRST EX-COP TO WORK
BOTH SIDES AGAINST THE MIDDLE.

18:48.828 --> 18:52.532
YOUR CAPTAIN?
THEY HAVE HIM IN A VISE.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.334
HE'LL THROW YOU OVER
IF HE HAS TO.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.405
- NOW YOU CAN GO.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.807
NOW.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.509
GO.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.384
- OFFICIALLY, SVU IS NOT ALLOWED
TO INVESTIGATE THIS.

19:11.418 --> 19:14.554
UNOFFICIALLY,
WE ARE ON THIS 24/7.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.590
- THEY GOT ME.
THEY WENT AFTER AMARO.

19:17.624 --> 19:18.858
I'D BACK AWAY.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.360
- NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.795
WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO SET YOU UP.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.298
- IT'S MY FAULT.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.399
I LET MY GUARD DOWN.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.868
THEY WERE LOOKING
FOR A WEAK LINK.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.803
- DO I HAVE TO GIVE YOU
THE "YOU ARE A VICTIM,

19:30.837 --> 19:31.804
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF"
SPEECH?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.406
BECAUSE I WILL.

19:33.440 --> 19:38.411
[cell phone rings]

19:38.445 --> 19:40.280
- WHAT?

19:40.313 --> 19:41.648
YEAH?

19:41.681 --> 19:42.649
YEAH.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.462
POLICE COMMISSIONER ANDREW BRADY
HAS JUST STEPPED DOWN.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.397
THE MAYOR ACCEPTED
THE COMMISSIONER'S RESIGNATION,

STATING THAT RECENT EVENTS HAD
CAST A PALL OVER THE DEPARTMENT.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.970

REALLY NECESSARY?

- WE DO. WE'LL GO AROUND
THE BACK.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.842
- I'LL CALL YOUR LAWYER
AND HAVE HIM MEET YOU THERE.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.984
[overlapping questions]

21:00.827 --> 21:01.828
[gavel banging]

21:01.861 --> 21:03.630
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

21:03.663 --> 21:06.666
DONALD CRAGEN, ON THE CHARGE
OF MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE,

21:06.699 --> 21:07.700
HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

21:07.734 --> 21:08.735
- NOT GUILTY.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.703
- PEOPLE ON BAIL?

21:10.737 --> 21:12.672
- WE REQUEST REMAND.
HE HAS MOTIVE TO FLEE.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.507
- YOUR HONOR,
CAPTAIN CRAGEN

21:14.541 --> 21:16.643
IS A DECORATED
30-YEAR VETERAN OF THE NYPD

21:16.676 --> 21:18.478
WITH AN IMPECCABLE REPUTATION.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.313
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
GIVEN CAPTAIN CRAGEN'S

21:20.347 --> 21:22.815
EXTENSIVE TIES TO OVERSEAS
LAW ENFORCEMENT,

21:22.849 --> 21:24.584
WE BELIEVE
HE'S A FLIGHT RISK.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.353
- THIS IS POLITICAL
GRANDSTANDING, YOUR HONOR.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.488
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING
YOUR CLIENT, YOUNG MAN.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.857
THE DEFENDANT IS REMANDED
TO SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

21:30.890 --> 21:31.858
AT RIKERS.

21:31.891 --> 21:35.695
[gavel bangs]

21:38.531 --> 21:40.733
- THEY WON'T LET HIM OUT
ON BAIL?

21:40.767 --> 21:42.001
THE MAYOR'S PLAYING HARDBALL.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.504
- YEAH. WELL, WE SHOULD TOO.
HE WAS SET UP.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.072
WE JUST GOT TO PUSH UNTIL
SOMEBODY TALKS.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.607
- CASSIDY THINKS
THAT DELIA'S BEHIND IT.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.041
- THAT'S POSSIBLE,
OR IT'S POSSIBLE

21:49.075 --> 21:53.045
CASSIDY'S PROTECTING GANZEL.

21:55.748 --> 21:56.883
- BART GANZEL?

21:58.851 --> 22:00.687
- YOU BARGE IN HERE WHILE
MY CLIENT IS SITTING SHIVA?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.522
HAVE YOU NO SHAME?

22:02.555 --> 22:04.891
- I'M SURE HE WANTS TO FIGURE
OUT WHO MURDERED CARISSA

22:04.924 --> 22:06.559
JUST AS MUCH AS WE DO.

22:06.593 --> 22:07.960
- SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.829
- WE ALREADY TOLD
THE D.A.'S INVESTIGATORS

22:09.862 --> 22:11.731
EVERYTHING WE KNOW.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.733
- AND THEN THEY ARRESTED
YOUR CAPTAIN.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.034
- GANZEL, YOU'RE A SMART MAN,

22:15.067 --> 22:17.704
YOU KNOW WE HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.005
- WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE FOUND?

22:19.038 --> 22:21.974
YOU THINK YOU KNOW PEOPLE
UNTIL YOU DON'T.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.511
- YEAH? WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW CARISSA?

22:24.544 --> 22:26.846
- WE MADE LOVE THAT AFTERNOON.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.015
SHE WAS SO WARM.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.717
ALIVE.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.485
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S NOT GONNA WALK

22:32.519 --> 22:33.820
THROUGH THAT DOOR ANY MINUTE.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.955
- DID SHE SEEM UPSET
ABOUT ANYTHING?

22:35.988 --> 22:38.891
- NO. SHE WAS GOOD
AT MASKING PAIN.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.893
SHE KNEW I LOVED
TO SEE HER SMILE.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.061
- 'CAUSE THE NIGHT
CARISSA DIED,

22:42.094 --> 22:43.896
SHE CONTACTED
AN SVU DETECTIVE

22:43.930 --> 22:45.898
AND SHE CALLED OUR CAPTAIN.

22:45.932 --> 22:46.933
YOU KNOW WHY
SHE WOULD DO THAT?

22:46.966 --> 22:48.601
WHAT SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT?

22:48.635 --> 22:49.936
- IN HINDSIGHT,
SHE MAY HAVE REALIZED

22:49.969 --> 22:51.738
DELIA WAS COMING AFTER HER.

22:51.771 --> 22:54.507
- WHY WOULD
DELIA GO AFTER HER?

22:54.541 --> 22:58.611
- 'CAUSE CARISSA WAS THE MOST
PRECIOUS THING IN MY LIFE.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.780
I WAS A THREAT
TO DELIA'S EMPIRE.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.649
THE COMMISSIONER'S SON'S
BACHELOR PARTY,

23:02.682 --> 23:05.652
DELIA SLIPPED THAT UNDERAGE GIRL
IN WITH MY ESCORTS,

23:05.685 --> 23:07.954
THEN KILLED HER--
SET ME UP.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.089
- AND YOU GOT BACK AT DELIA
BY KILLING THE FORMER GOVERNOR,

23:10.122 --> 23:12.659
RIGHT--
HER FOUR-STAR CLIENT?

23:12.692 --> 23:13.926
- DELIA PROBABLY
KILLED HIM HERSELF.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.528
MADE IT LOOK LIKE
MY CLIENT'S REVENGE.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.464
I WOULDN'T
UNDERESTIMATE HER.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.498
- YOU GOT PROOF?

23:18.531 --> 23:19.866
- COMMON SENSE.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.569
SHE'S FACING
CRIMINAL CHARGES.

23:22.602 --> 23:23.936
AND THERE'S NOTHING
MORE DANGEROUS

23:23.970 --> 23:25.572
THAN A TRAPPED WHOREMONGER.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.707
SHE GETS BACK AT ME.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.576
KILLS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.143
FRAMES YOUR CAPTAIN.

23:31.177 --> 23:34.681
DELIA WILSON DIDN'T GET
WHERE SHE IS BY PLAYING NICE.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.649
- MS. FOSTER,
HOW'S YOUR DAUGHTER?

23:36.683 --> 23:37.684
IS SHE DOING ANY BETTER?

23:37.717 --> 23:40.487
- SHE'S FINE.
THANK YOU.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.854
- MM-HMM.

23:41.888 --> 23:42.989
- YOU SAID YOUR CLIENT'S
READY TO MAKE A DEAL.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.491
LET'S HEAR IT.
- YEAH.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.225
DOES DETECTIVE BENSON
NEED TO BE HERE?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.660
- I INVITED HER.

23:47.694 --> 23:49.496
- WELL, THE REASON I ASK
IS BECAUSE

23:49.529 --> 23:51.197
WE'RE COMING FORWARD TODAY
WITH SOME SENSITIVE INFORMATION

23:51.230 --> 23:52.799
ABOUT HER CAPTAIN.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.734
- YOU HAVEN'T
SET HIM UP ENOUGH?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.903
- PROOF THAT CARISSA GIBSON
WASN'T THE FIRST ESCORT

23:56.936 --> 23:58.104
THAT CRAGEN HAS BEEN WITH.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.152
- HE DIDN'T TELL YOU,
DID HE?

24:13.185 --> 24:14.654
- THOSE AREN'T PROBATIVE
OF MISCONDUCT,

24:14.687 --> 24:16.188
AND THEY COULD'VE BEEN
PHOTOSHOPPED.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.524
- PLEASE, FEEL FREE
TO AUTHENTICATE.

24:17.557 --> 24:18.658
THEY'RE YOURS TO KEEP.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.992
- YOU HAVE ANY
CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS?

24:20.026 --> 24:21.694
ANY PHONE RECORDS?
E-MAILS?

24:21.728 --> 24:23.796
- HE USED PAY PHONES
AND PAID WITH CASH.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.798
- AND WE CAN PROVIDE
SWORN AFFIDAVITS

24:25.832 --> 24:28.535
DETAILING CRAGEN'S DEVIANT
SEXUAL PROCLIVITIES,

24:28.568 --> 24:32.071
SUCH AS CHOKING, RESTRAINTS,
KNIFE PLAYING.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.573
- I'M NOT LISTENING TO THIS.

24:33.606 --> 24:36.909
- WAIT, JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.711
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

24:38.745 --> 24:40.747
- I JUST WANT THIS NIGHTMARE
TO END.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.882
- YOU HAVE ONE CHARGE
OF THIRD-DEGREE PROSTITUTION

24:42.915 --> 24:44.717
AGAINST MY CLIENT.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.553
DROP IT IN EXCHANGE
FOR HER TESTIMONY

24:46.586 --> 24:49.689
AGAINST AN SVU CAPTAIN
WHO ABUSED ESCORTS

24:49.722 --> 24:51.190
AND ENDED UP MURDERING ONE.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.025
- AND MAGGIE MURPHY?
THE FIRST VICTIM?

24:53.059 --> 24:54.627
THAT CASE JUST GOES AWAY?

24:54.661 --> 24:57.697
- AH, YES, THE BACHELOR PARTY.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.666
SORRY TO SEE
THE COMMISSIONER RESIGN.

24:59.699 --> 25:03.570
WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE EVIDENCE
IMPLICATING ANYA SOLAR.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.938
GOOD LUCK GETTING THE
ENLIGHTENED NATION OF COLOMBIA

25:05.972 --> 25:07.740
TO EXTRADITE HER.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.141
- ANYA TRUSTS ME.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.110
I CAN GET HER HERE.

25:11.143 --> 25:14.781
- IN EXCHANGE FOR MS. WILSON'S
IMMUNITY ON THE MURDER CHARGE.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.750
- GET MS. SOLAR ON U.S. SOIL,
THEN WE'LL TALK.

25:17.784 --> 25:20.252
- MS. FOSTER,
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHIPS.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.754
WE DO.

25:21.788 --> 25:24.023
CALL ME
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BID.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.203
- YOU WOULDN'T REALLY PLAY BALL
WITH THEM, WOULD YOU?

25:37.236 --> 25:39.706
- THAT SON OF A BITCH, EXLEY,
PRETENDING TO CARE

25:39.739 --> 25:41.741
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER?

25:41.774 --> 25:45.678
SARAH'S NINE. SHE WAS BORN
WITH LOBSTEIN SYNDROME,

25:45.712 --> 25:46.979
HER BONES ARE LIKE GLASS.

25:47.013 --> 25:50.116
SHE'S FRAGILE, BUT BRAVE.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.685
- I'M SORRY.
THAT MUST BE REALLY HARD.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.354
- I KNOW WHAT DELIA WILSON IS.

25:55.387 --> 26:00.192
BUT SEX TRAFFICKING, EXTORTION,
THREE MURDERS?

26:00.226 --> 26:03.029
WE MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE
A DEVIL'S DEAL ON THIS.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.998
AND, CONE OF SILENCE,
I HAVE CONFIRMATION ON SOME

26:06.032 --> 26:07.800
OF HER ALLEGATIONS
AGAINST YOUR CAPTAIN.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.670
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I COULD USE A DRINK.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.839
- I'M FINE.
CONFIRMATION ON WHAT?

26:12.872 --> 26:14.674
- WIRETAPS.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.709
WE'VE HAD GANZEL UNDER
SURVEILLANCE FOR THREE YEARS.

26:16.743 --> 26:19.178
BRIAN CASSIDY IS MY U.C.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.180
I KNOW YOU GUYS GO BACK.
I FIGURED YOU'D FIND OUT.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.382
- CASSIDY NEVER SAID A WORD.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.951
- THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE

26:24.984 --> 26:26.719
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.688
DAVID HADEN.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.189
HE CAME UP ON THE WIRETAPS.

26:30.222 --> 26:33.793
WE LEARNED YOU TWO
WERE INVOLVED.

26:35.828 --> 26:38.965
- [sighs]

26:38.998 --> 26:41.067
OKAY.

26:44.704 --> 26:45.872
SO NOW WHAT?

26:45.905 --> 26:47.740
- WELL, IT LEAVES YOU BOTH
VULNERABLE.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.075
- YES.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.744
- TECHNICALLY, I SHOULD
REPORT IT, BUT...

26:51.778 --> 26:53.780
I DON'T KNOW THAT
THAT NEEDS TO COME OUT.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.216
ANOTHER NAME KEEPS POPPING UP.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.284
AMARO.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.686
WHAT'S YOUR GUT ON HIM?

26:59.719 --> 27:02.722
- AMARO IS GOOD POLICE.

27:02.755 --> 27:03.956
- THE NIGHT CARISSA GIBSON
WAS KILLED,

27:03.990 --> 27:06.793
SHE TOLD YOUR CAPTAIN AMARO
CAME ON TO HER.

27:06.826 --> 27:07.426
- NOT A CHANCE.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.261
- HE'S BEEN UNDER STRESS.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.963
YOU WERE THERE--HE AND HIS WIFE
HAD A PUBLIC FIGHT

27:10.997 --> 27:12.098
IN THE SQUAD ROOM.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.399
- HE WOULDN'T HIT ON CARISSA,

27:13.432 --> 27:15.735
AND HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T
KILL HER.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.103
- I KNOW YOU'RE LOYAL
TO YOUR PARTNER.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.905
YOU'RE LOYAL TO YOUR CAPTAIN.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.439
BUT, OBJECTIVELY,

27:20.472 --> 27:23.943
ANY OTHER GUY FOUND IN BED
WITH A DEAD HOOKER,

27:23.976 --> 27:26.913
HIS PRINTS ON THE KNIFE,
HER SALIVA ON HIS GENITALS--

27:26.946 --> 27:28.280
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I GET IT.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.281
THE OPTICS.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.817
- WE'RE PAST THAT.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.786
HE'S THE PRIME SUSPECT.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.689
YOU THINK YOU KNOW HIM.

27:36.723 --> 27:39.291
BUT PEOPLE
LEAD DOUBLE LIVES.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.427
EVERYBODY HAS SECRETS.
I DO.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.428
YOU DO.

27:42.461 --> 27:46.265
NOW WE KNOW
YOUR CAPTAIN DOES.

27:46.298 --> 27:50.269
- AND THERE'S
NO WAY THAT HE DID THIS.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.872
- THEN IT'S ONE HELL
OF A SETUP.

27:52.905 --> 27:55.107
IF HE DIDN'T INVITE HER IN,
SOMEONE SENT HER THERE.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.143
- SOMEONE?
YOU MEAN DELIA?

27:57.176 --> 27:58.978
- CARISSA'S ENGAGED TO GANZEL.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.312
HOW WOULD DELIA GET TO HER?

28:03.515 --> 28:06.786
- GANZEL POACHED DELIA'S
OTHER ESCORTS.

28:06.819 --> 28:09.055
MAYBE HE POACHED CARISSA TOO.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.460
DELIA'S BOOKER, IRIS...

28:14.493 --> 28:17.997
SHE MIGHT KNOW IF CARISSA WORKED
FOR DELIA BEFORE.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.733
- IS SHE THE ONE WHO'S
TESTIFYING AGAINST DELIA

28:20.767 --> 28:21.834
ON THE PROSTITUTION CHARGE?

28:23.836 --> 28:25.738
TAKE A RUN AT HER.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.842
- HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

28:29.876 --> 28:31.510
- I MISS MY DAUGHTERS.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.480
- WELL, IT'S BEST
THAT THEY STAY OUT OF TOWN.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.949
YOU CAN JOIN THEM,
AFTER THE GRAND JURY.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.384
IT'S ONLY ONE MORE DAY.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.887
- AND THEN DELIA
MAGICALLY FORGIVES ME?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.421
I SAW WHAT SHE DID
TO YOUR CAPTAIN.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.791
- YOU THINK DELIA HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS?

28:44.824 --> 28:46.192
- I'M NOT TESTIFYING
ABOUT THAT.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.860
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TESTIFY.

28:47.894 --> 28:51.497
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,
THOUGH, IS, UM...

28:51.530 --> 28:54.033
HOW CARISSA IS INVOLVED
IN ALL OF THIS.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.803
SHE EVER WORKED FOR DELIA?

28:56.836 --> 29:00.406
- WHEN CARISSA FIRST GOT
TO TOWN, SHE WAS DELIA'S GIRL.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.875
AND THE GOVERNOR'S,
EVERY TUESDAY NIGHT.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.410
- SO, YOU'RE SAYING
IF CARISSA SHOWED UP

29:04.443 --> 29:06.145
AT HIS TOWNHOUSE,
HE WOULD'VE LET HER IN?

29:07.579 --> 29:10.549
- SO CARISSA KILLS
THE FORMER GOVERNOR.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.885
DELIA KILLS CARISSA
FOR PAYBACK.

29:12.919 --> 29:16.022
- LIKE I SAID, I AM NOT
TESTIFYING ABOUT THAT.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.390
AND AFTER THE GRAND JURY,
I WANT WITNESS PROTECTION

29:18.424 --> 29:20.292
FOR ME AND MY DAUGHTERS.

29:20.326 --> 29:23.529
- WE'LL TALK TO THE D.A.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.397
GET SOME REST, OKAY?

29:25.431 --> 29:28.134
WE'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.869
[door lock buzzes]

29:34.440 --> 29:36.142
- HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

29:37.877 --> 29:41.347
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.249
- EVERYBODY'S SURVIVING
WITHOUT ME.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.483
- BARELY.

29:44.516 --> 29:48.554
- I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT.

29:48.587 --> 29:52.925
- CAPTAIN, YOU WERE A MARK
FROM THE BEGINNING.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.426
THEY'RE PUTTING IT OUT THERE
THAT YOU'RE ONE

29:54.460 --> 29:56.829
OF DELIA'S CLIENTS--
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.400
- [sighs]

30:01.433 --> 30:03.936
I HAVE EXPOSURE HERE.

30:06.939 --> 30:10.943
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

30:10.977 --> 30:14.613
- AFTER I WENT UNDERCOVER
AS A JOHN WITH LENA,

30:14.646 --> 30:18.250
I REALIZED HOW LONELY I WAS.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.551
HOW HAPPY IT MADE ME JUST
TO HAVE SOMEBODY NICE

30:19.585 --> 30:21.087
TO TALK TO.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.621
- SO YOU USED
A MATCHMAKING SERVICE

30:22.654 --> 30:23.622
OR A DATING SITE.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.092
- PLEASE.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.526
IT JUST SEEMED SIMPLER.

30:27.559 --> 30:31.463
YOU PAY. YOU HAVE SOMEBODY
TO TALK TO.

30:31.497 --> 30:35.501
THERE'S NO STRINGS,
NO PRESSURE.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.137
COMPANIONSHIP, LIV.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.472
I SWEAR, THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.210
A FEW DATES.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.578
I SLIPPED.

30:46.612 --> 30:50.349
AND THEN I CAME TO MY SENSES.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.188
- YOU GOT TO GET IN FRONT
OF THIS.

31:01.227 --> 31:02.861
TELL YOUR LAWYER.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.301
- WHY?

31:10.536 --> 31:13.605
- I FINALLY GOT ZARA TO SLEEP.

31:13.639 --> 31:16.208
EXPECTING ANY VISITORS
TONIGHT?

31:16.242 --> 31:19.278
- [sighs]
I TOLD YOU.

31:19.311 --> 31:23.115
THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

31:23.149 --> 31:28.387
LOOK, THEY'RE BRINGING ME IN
TO, UH, TESTIFY

31:28.420 --> 31:30.556
IN THAT ESCORT'S MURDER,
CARISSA.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.058
SHE'S THE ONE WHO CALLED ME
MONDAY NIGHT.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.293
- NICK--
- NOW LOOK, I WANT YOU TO KNOW--

31:34.326 --> 31:35.694
- NICK, PLEASE STOP.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.931
- I WANNA TALK
ABOUT THINGS.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.599
I'M SORRY.

31:45.537 --> 31:46.672
WHAT?

31:50.242 --> 31:51.577
- I'M MOVING.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.116
TO D.C.

31:59.385 --> 32:00.719
- YOU'RE WHAT?

32:00.752 --> 32:02.721
- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU

32:02.754 --> 32:04.590
AND WHATEVER HAPPENED
WITH THAT WOMAN--

32:04.623 --> 32:06.192
- NOTHING HAPPENED.

32:06.225 --> 32:07.726
- IT DOESN'T MATTER, NICK.
DOESN'T MATTER.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.096
OKAY, I'M--I'M TIRED
OF WAITING AROUND

32:10.129 --> 32:12.631
FOR YOU TO MAKE TIME FOR US.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.500
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST--

32:14.533 --> 32:16.602
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK?

32:16.635 --> 32:17.603
- YEAH, WHO'S IN D.C.?

32:17.636 --> 32:19.205
- NO ONE, OKAY?
- YEAH.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.206
- I JUST--I TOOK
A COMMUNICATIONS POST

32:20.239 --> 32:22.608
WITH THE PENTAGON.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.543
ZARA AND I ARE GOING TO STAY
WITH MY FOLKS.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.078
- ZARA.
- MM-HMM.

32:26.112 --> 32:28.114
- NO, SHE'S OUR DAUGHTER.
MY DAUGHTER.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.482
- I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM HER
FOR TOO LONG. I'M SORRY.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.337
- SHE KNEW WE WERE COMING
AT 10:00.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.339
- DID YOU SEE IRIS TODAY?

32:53.372 --> 32:54.373
- I GOT HERE AT 8:00.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.275
NO ONE IN OR OUT SINCE THEN.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.210
MAYBE SHE'S IN THE CAN.

32:58.244 --> 32:59.578
- AND THE HOUSE WAS WATCHED
ALL NIGHT?

32:59.611 --> 33:02.114
- NO, SHE WASN'T UNDER 24/7.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.482
IF THERE WAS A SECTOR CAR
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

33:03.515 --> 33:05.617
THEY DID A DRIVE-BY.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.606
- IRIS?

33:32.578 --> 33:35.247
IRIS?

33:35.281 --> 33:36.815
YOU IN THERE?

33:36.848 --> 33:38.617
IRIS?

33:40.786 --> 33:42.754
[gasps]

33:42.788 --> 33:44.523
OH, DEAR LORD.

33:44.556 --> 33:47.426
- IT'S TOO LATE.

33:47.459 --> 33:50.596
SHE'S GONE.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.267
- NOT A CHANCE.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.336
IRIS WAS A LITTLE DEPRESSED,
SHE WAS ANXIOUS, BUT...

33:57.369 --> 33:58.804
SHE WAS NOT SUICIDAL.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.572
ALL SHE WANTED WAS TO BE
WITH HER DAUGHTERS.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.774
- IF FORCE WAS USED,
THE BRUISING WOULD'VE SHOWN

34:02.808 --> 34:04.276
POST-MORTEM.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.577
- TOX SCREEN CLEAN?

34:05.611 --> 34:06.745
- ALCOHOL AND XANAX
IN HER SYSTEM,

34:06.778 --> 34:08.480
WHICH SHE COULD'VE
TAKEN HERSELF.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.282
- OR SOMEBODY COULD'VE
SLIPPED IT TO HER.

34:10.316 --> 34:12.851
WAITED FOR HER TO PASS OUT
AND, YOU KNOW--

34:12.884 --> 34:14.520
SLIT HER WRISTS.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.788
THERE'D BE NO SIGNS OF FORCE.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.625
- IF YOU HAVE REASON
TO BE PARANOID,

34:19.658 --> 34:21.427
THAT COULD BE
A POSSIBLE SCENARIO.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.829
- YES. WE HAVE REASON.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.864
- OKAY, SO JUST DON'T
RULE IT AS SUICIDE YET,

34:25.897 --> 34:30.136
KEEP IT OPEN,
PENDING INVESTIGATION, PLEASE.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.172
- YOU'RE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT
TO COUNSEL?

34:33.205 --> 34:35.307
- I DON'T NEED A LAWYER.

34:35.341 --> 34:37.243
- OKAY, THEN, DETECTIVE.

34:37.276 --> 34:39.778
ACCORDING TO CELL RECORDS,
THERE WERE THREE CALLS MADE

34:39.811 --> 34:42.181
BETWEEN YOU AND CARISSA GIBSON
ON THE NIGHT SHE WAS MURDERED.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.415
WHAT WERE THOSE ABOUT?

34:45.151 --> 34:46.118
- [sighs]

34:46.152 --> 34:47.886
WELL, SHE...

34:47.919 --> 34:49.821
WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
SHE...

34:49.855 --> 34:51.390
- ACTUALLY, SO ARE YOU.

34:51.423 --> 34:52.691
I'M GOING TO NEED YOU
TO SIT DOWN.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.526
FOR THE CAMERA.

35:01.200 --> 35:06.572
THE FIRST CALL
LASTED SEVEN MINUTES.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.774
- YEAH, SHE, UH...

35:08.807 --> 35:11.777
SHE SAID SHE FELT TRAPPED,
AND SHE WANTED OUT AND...

35:11.810 --> 35:13.512
SHE WASN'T MAKING SENSE.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.181
- AND SHE CALLED YOU BACK
A FEW MINUTES LATER

35:15.214 --> 35:16.815
FOR ONLY 20 SECONDS.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.817
- YEAH, I HAD TO GET OFF
THE CALL.

35:18.850 --> 35:22.654
- AND WHY IS THAT?

35:22.688 --> 35:24.790
- IT'S A PERSONAL MATTER.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.792
- ONE MINUTE LATER,
YOU CALLED HER BACK.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.827
- YES.
BUT SHE DIDN'T PICK UP.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.429
- DETECTIVE AMARO,

35:30.462 --> 35:31.763
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

35:31.797 --> 35:33.932
WITH CARISSA GIBSON?

35:33.965 --> 35:36.802
- SHE'S A WITNESS
IN THE MURDER INVESTIGATION

35:36.835 --> 35:38.404
OF MAGGIE MURPHY.

35:38.437 --> 35:43.909
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

35:43.942 --> 35:46.245
- EARLIER THAT NIGHT.

35:46.278 --> 35:49.315
AND SHE SAID
SHE HAD INFORMATION.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.317
I SAID I COULDN'T HELP HER
UNLESS SHE CAME IN

35:51.350 --> 35:52.818
AND MADE A STATEMENT.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.586
- WERE THERE ANY WITNESSES
TO THIS ENCOUNTER?

35:54.620 --> 35:57.489
- WELL, SHE APPROACHED ME
IN THE PRECINCT PARKING LOT.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.392
SO THERE WERE
OTHER OFFICERS AROUND.

36:00.426 --> 36:03.262
- BUT NOBODY HEARD YOU TWO.

36:03.295 --> 36:04.596
- PROBABLY NOT, NO.

36:04.630 --> 36:05.931
- DID YOU DISCUSS
PERSONAL MATTERS?

36:05.964 --> 36:07.333
- NO.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.900
- DID YOU TOUCH HER PHYSICALLY?

36:08.934 --> 36:10.236
- WAIT, WHAT?

36:10.269 --> 36:12.671
NO, NO--
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

36:12.704 --> 36:14.906
- DID YOU SUGGEST THAT
THE TWO OF YOU GO TO A HOTEL?

36:14.940 --> 36:16.908
- WAIT, WHO--
WHO ARE YOU GETTING THIS FROM?

36:16.942 --> 36:18.677
CASSIDY?

36:18.710 --> 36:20.946
- SO YOU MAINTAIN
THAT YOUR BEHAVIOR WITH HER

36:20.979 --> 36:22.214
NEVER CROSSED A LINE?

36:22.248 --> 36:24.483
- TELL ME WHO SAID THAT!

36:24.516 --> 36:25.951
I'M A MARRIED MAN.
I'VE NEVER EVEN LOOKED

36:25.984 --> 36:27.886
AT ANOTHER WOMAN.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

36:27.919 --> 36:30.522
- I DO, DETECTIVE.
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.891
- ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

36:32.924 --> 36:35.861
GOT WHAT YOU WANTED
OUT OF ME, COUNSELOR?

36:38.564 --> 36:40.399
- SO IRIS IS FOUND DEAD AN HOUR
BEFORE SHE'S GONNA TESTIFY

36:40.432 --> 36:41.867
AGAINST DELIA WILSON?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.935
AND WARNER DOES NOT
RULE IT MURDER?

36:43.969 --> 36:45.871
- DELIA ONLY HIRES THE BEST.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.539
NO FORCED ENTRY,
NO BRUISING--

36:47.573 --> 36:49.308
- NO WITNESS,
NO PROSTITUTION CASE.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.709
I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY BRAZEN.

36:50.742 --> 36:53.379
- MAGGIE MURPHY, THEN CARISSA.
NOW IRIS.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.514
WE BETTER WATCH OUR BACKS.
- HEY.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.883
THOUGHT WE WERE MEETING
AT NOON.

36:57.916 --> 37:01.820
- UM, WE FEEL THAT YOU SHOULD
SIT THIS ONE OUT.

37:01.853 --> 37:04.890
- WHAT IS THIS? HUH?

37:04.923 --> 37:05.991
YOU DON'T TRUST ME?

37:06.024 --> 37:07.993
- NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

37:08.026 --> 37:09.695
YOU MADE CONTACT WITH CARISSA
THAT NIGHT.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.029
YOU'RE A WITNESS.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.698
- SO THAT'S A YES?
- NO ONE'S SAYING THAT.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.300
- YOU REALLY THINK I HIT ON HER?
- NO.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.368
- SO WHAT NEXT?
I TRACKED HER AND THE CAPTAIN

37:16.402 --> 37:18.337
AND SLIT HER THROAT--
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING?

37:18.370 --> 37:20.739
- TAKE IT EASY, ALL RIGHT?

37:20.772 --> 37:22.441
- THIS IS ALL COMING
FROM CASSIDY, ISN'T IT?

37:22.474 --> 37:23.809
- YOU GOT HIM ALL WRONG.
- OH, YEAH. DO I?

37:23.842 --> 37:25.043
- YEAH.
- I DID SOME DIGGING.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.379
HE'S NOT ASSIGNED TO VICE.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.648
AND I.A.B. DOESN'T WORK U.C.s
THREE YEARS.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.750
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THE HELL
THIS GUY'S WORKING FOR!

37:31.783 --> 37:32.884
- CASSIDY IS GOOD POLICE.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.454
- ALL OF YOU
HAVE BLINDERS ON!

37:35.487 --> 37:37.789
THIS ISN'T THE SAME KID
YOU WORKED WITH 13 YEARS AGO.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.759
LOOK, I'VE BEEN THERE.
I'VE WORKED U.C.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.428
THIS GUY'S BEEN IN TOO LONG.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.862
HE'S INFATUATED WITH GANZEL.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.797
HE'S IN THAT WORLD,
WITH THAT MUCH TEMPTATION.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.799
I'M TELLING YOU,
HE'S CROSSED OVER!

37:49.100 --> 37:50.869
- NICK. NICK!

37:53.004 --> 37:54.440
WE'RE DOING THIS
FOR THE CAPTAIN

37:54.473 --> 37:55.941
AND YOU.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.909
NOW GO HOME TO BE
WITH YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

37:57.943 --> 37:58.910
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.
ALL RIGHT?

37:58.944 --> 37:59.911
- YEAH.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.080
[cell phone ringing]

38:02.113 --> 38:04.049
YEAH, I'LL DO THAT.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.784
- BENSON.

38:05.817 --> 38:09.721
WHAT?

38:09.755 --> 38:11.022
I--I'M ON MY WAY.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.792
- WHAT NOW?
- THAT WAS FOSTER.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.927
ANYA SOLAR,
THE LAST POSSIBLE WITNESS

38:15.961 --> 38:18.930
AGAINST DELIA WILSON,
WAS KILLED LAST NIGHT

38:18.964 --> 38:21.367
IN A CAR ACCIDENT
OUTSIDE CARTAGENA.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.708
- OKAY, I'M GONNA BE
RIGHT BACK, GUYS.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.846
- SHE HAS PHYSICAL THERAPY
EVERY DAY.

38:34.880 --> 38:35.981
I TRY TO BE WITH HER
WHENEVER I CAN.

38:36.014 --> 38:36.982
THANKS FOR MEETING ME HERE.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.818
- OH, OF COURSE.

38:39.851 --> 38:43.455
SO WE LOSE ANYA AND IRIS
IN ONE DAY.

38:43.489 --> 38:46.024
- THE EMBASSY BELIEVES ANYA'S
CAR WAS RUN OFF A CLIFF

38:46.057 --> 38:47.659
BY A CEMENT MIXER.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.027
LOCAL POLICE INSIST
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.629
I CAN'T GET THE REPORT.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.731
- DELIA'S MUSCLE REALLY
GOES THAT FAR?

38:52.764 --> 38:55.467
- IN CARTAGENA,
THAT'S A SMALL FAVOR.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.937
FAKE ACCIDENT.
FAKE SUICIDE.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.839
SHE'S CLEANING HOUSE.

39:00.872 --> 39:03.909
- NOT TO MENTION FRAMING
MY CAPTAIN FOR CARISSA'S MURDER.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.411
- THAT ONE I'M STILL
A LITTLE MURKY ON.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.012
LET'S TAKE IT BACK A STEP.

39:07.045 --> 39:11.383
YOU TOLD ME THAT CARISSA
USED TO BE

39:11.417 --> 39:12.751
THE GOVERNOR'S FAVORITE.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.486
- YEAH, BACK WHEN SHE WORKED
FOR DELIA.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.054
- AND GANZEL KNEW THIS.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.823
SO HE SENT CARISSA TO KILL
THE GOVERNOR

39:17.856 --> 39:19.825
AND OUT DELIA AS A MADAM.

39:19.858 --> 39:24.129
- LOOK, DELIA MUST HAVE FIGURED
OUT THAT CARISSA DID THE HIT.

39:24.162 --> 39:27.699
MAYBE SHE BLACKMAILS HER
TO DRUG CRAGEN.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.568
AND THEN DOUBLE-CROSSES HER?

39:29.601 --> 39:31.803
THERE'S MOTIVE THERE
ON ALL THREE.

39:31.837 --> 39:34.806
DID IRIS HAVE ANY IDEA WHO DELIA
USES TO DO HER WET WORK?

39:34.840 --> 39:38.176
- IF SHE DID,
SHE TOOK IT WITH HER.

39:38.209 --> 39:41.413
BUT CASSIDY TOLD ME THAT DELIA
SENT GOONS IN

39:41.447 --> 39:42.814
TO THREATEN GANZEL.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.684
- GANZEL? GOOD LUCK GETTING HIM
TO I.D. THEM FOR US.

39:45.717 --> 39:46.818
- YEAH, BUT WE HAVE TO TRY.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.954
MY CAPTAIN IS SITTING IN JAIL.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.860
GANZEL TRUSTS CASSIDY.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.895
MAYBE HE AND I CAN WORK HIM.

39:56.928 --> 39:59.698
- THIS IS A THREE-YEAR
OPERATION.

39:59.731 --> 40:00.932
CASSIDY'S EXTREMELY VULNERABLE.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.468
I DON'T WANT TO PUT HIM
IN JEOPARDY.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.103
- NEITHER DO I.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.105
- YEAH, THERE WAS
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

40:07.138 --> 40:08.106
THAT COULD I.D.
THESE GOONS.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.541
- CAN YOU GET IT?

40:09.575 --> 40:11.142
- NOT WITHOUT GANZEL
FINDING OUT.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.745
LOOK, I'M ON THIN ICE AS IT IS,
ALL RIGHT?

40:13.779 --> 40:15.213
HOW MANY TIMES
CAN I TELL THIS GUY

40:15.246 --> 40:16.948
HE NEEDS TO COOPERATE
WITH MY FORMER EMPLOYERS, HUH?

40:16.982 --> 40:21.219
- CRAGEN IS IN RIKERS,
AND DELIA PUT HIM THERE.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.455
- I KNOW I LOOK LIKE A DUMB COP,
ALL RIGHT?

40:23.489 --> 40:24.890
I GET IT, TRUST ME.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.992
BUT WHAT I DON'T GET
IS EVEN IF GANZEL

40:27.025 --> 40:30.462
I.D.s DELIA'S BAD BOYS,
WHY WOULD THEY FLIP, HMM?

40:30.496 --> 40:33.198
- ONE STEP AT THE TIME.

40:33.231 --> 40:36.034
- TELL GANZEL
IT'S TOO HOT FOR HIM

40:36.067 --> 40:39.905
TO GO AFTER DELIA HIMSELF.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.840
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO,
ALL RIGHT?

40:41.873 --> 40:44.610
BUT, LIV, YOU GOT TO KEEP
YOUR PARTNER OUT OF THIS ONE.

40:44.643 --> 40:46.177
THOSE TIGHT-WOUND COPS,

40:46.211 --> 40:49.648
THEY'RE THE ONES YOU GOT
TO LOOK OUT FOR.

40:49.681 --> 40:52.518
I GOTTA BOUNCE.
HOT DATE.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.932
- WHERE'S BENSON BEEN ALL DAY?

41:06.965 --> 41:09.635
- SHE AND MUNCH HAD
A COURT APPEARANCE.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.970
- UH-HUH.
OUR FRIENDS AT ONE P.P.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.839
ARE UNDER THE MISAPPREHENSION
THAT SOME OF YOU

41:13.872 --> 41:15.941
HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING
IRIS PETERSON'S DEATH.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.510
- SHE'S THE MAIN WITNESS AGAINST
DELIA WILSON.

41:18.544 --> 41:21.647
HOW IS THAT NOT
SPECIAL VICTIMS?

41:21.680 --> 41:23.048
- I ADMIRE YOUR INITIATIVE
AND YOUR LOYALTY.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.115
I DON'T SEE A LOT OF EITHER.

41:24.149 --> 41:26.251
- WELCOME TO S.V.U.

41:26.284 --> 41:28.253
- BUT WE HAVE TO STICK
TO OUR ASSIGNED CASES.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.856
AS OF THIS MORNING,
THREE MORE MASSAGE THERAPISTS

41:30.889 --> 41:32.290
HAVE COME FORWARD,
CLAIMING OUR CELEBRITY,

41:32.323 --> 41:34.292
MISTER "X,"
MADE UNWANTED GRABS.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.694
THERE'S A WITNESS ON HIS WAY UP.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.128
YOU TWO TAKE HIS STATEMENT.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.897
I TRUST YOU'LL TREAT HIM
WITH RESPECT.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.033
AND WHERE THE HELL IS AMARO?

41:44.035 --> 41:46.672
- COME ON, MOM, EAT.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.674
IT'S SWEET AND SOUR.
IT'S YOUR FAVORITE.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.108
- I'LL SWELL UP
LIKE A BALLOON.

41:50.141 --> 41:52.911
- WOULD YOU STOP IT, PLEASE?
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

41:52.944 --> 41:54.145
- HEY.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.147
WE NEED TO TALK.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.216
- CAN IT WAIT UNTIL I FINISH
EATING DINNER WITH MY MOM?

41:58.249 --> 42:02.320
- I APOLOGIZE,
MRS. CASSIDY, BUT, UH,

42:02.353 --> 42:05.857
I NEED TO BORROW YOUR SON
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.292
- YOU BOYS DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.031
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.335
- WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU
GET OFF, PAL, HUH?

42:17.368 --> 42:19.004
- WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU WORKING FOR?

42:19.037 --> 42:20.706
- WHAT? WHOA, WHOA--
- YOU'RE NOT NYPD.

42:20.739 --> 42:23.108
YOU ON GANZEL'S PAYROLL
OR WORKING BACKDOOR FOR DELIA?

42:23.141 --> 42:24.943
- HEY, BACK IT UP,
RICKY RICARDO.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.978
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

42:27.012 --> 42:28.079
- TELL ME WHO YOU'RE WORKING
FOR, OR I'LL SHOOT YOU!

42:28.113 --> 42:30.649
I'LL KILL YOU RIGHT NOW.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.923
- HEY, PUT THAT THING DOWN,
ALL RIGHT?

42:37.956 --> 42:39.057
YOU DON'T WANNA DO THIS.
- OH, YEAH. ACTUALLY, I DO.

42:39.090 --> 42:40.191
- THE WHOLE RESTAURANT
JUST SAW YOU.

42:40.225 --> 42:41.860
- WHO ARE YOU WORKING FOR?

42:41.893 --> 42:44.262
- LOOK...AMARO...

42:44.295 --> 42:45.897
I THINK WE GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT HERE.

42:45.931 --> 42:47.365
- MAN, SHUT UP!

42:47.398 --> 42:48.900
I DON'T LIKE YOU,
I DON'T TRUST YOU.

42:48.934 --> 42:49.801
JUST TELL ME WHO
YOU'RE WORKING FOR.

42:49.835 --> 42:51.903
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT!

42:51.937 --> 42:53.171
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHO I REPORT TO.

42:53.204 --> 42:55.306
ALL RIGHT?
YOU KNOW THAT!

42:55.340 --> 42:58.343
I'M U.C.
I'M INVESTIGATING GANZEL

42:58.376 --> 43:00.846
AND ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT HE HAS ON THE TAKE:

43:00.879 --> 43:04.315
VICE, D.A.s,
NYPD WHITE SHIRTS.

43:04.349 --> 43:06.017
- THAT'S GOOD, SWEETHEART.

43:06.051 --> 43:07.953
- IT'S STUCK ON SOMETHING.

43:07.986 --> 43:09.888
- GET DOWN.
YOU'LL HURT YOURSELF.

43:12.357 --> 43:14.259
- I LOVED CARISSA TOO.

43:14.292 --> 43:18.096
BUT PERHAPS WORK WOULD TAKE
YOUR MIND OFF OF YOUR GRIEF.

43:18.129 --> 43:20.398
- SHIVA, BARRY,
MEANS SEVEN DAYS.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.333
I'VE BEEN AT IT FOR FOUR.

43:22.367 --> 43:23.835
I GOT IT.

43:26.905 --> 43:30.208
SON OF A BITCH.

43:30.241 --> 43:34.412
[cell phone ringing]
- LET THAT GO TO VOICEMAIL.

43:34.445 --> 43:35.747
CARISSA.

43:35.781 --> 43:38.950
- RIGHT. CARISSA.

43:38.984 --> 43:41.987
LOOK, SHE CALLS ME THAT NIGHT.

43:42.020 --> 43:43.789
OKAY? SHE'S HYSTERICAL.

43:43.822 --> 43:46.057
SHE SAYS THAT YOU WERE
INAPPROPRIATE WITH HER.

43:46.091 --> 43:50.061
FRANKLY, RIGHT NOW, I KIND OF
SEE HOW SHE GOT THAT IMPRESSION.

43:50.095 --> 43:53.298
- SHE LIED.
I NEVER TOUCHED HER.

43:53.331 --> 43:55.133
- WELL, THEN, YOU MISSED OUT,
M'IJO.

43:55.166 --> 43:57.135
SHE HAD A REAL THING FOR COPS.

43:57.168 --> 43:58.870
- DID YOU TELL GANZEL
WHAT SHE SAID?

43:58.904 --> 44:00.138
- IT NEVER CAME UP.

44:00.171 --> 44:02.073
BUT AFTER, CARISSA--

44:02.107 --> 44:04.442
SHE CALLS GANZEL
ON HIS PRIVATE CELL, RIGHT?

44:04.475 --> 44:06.878
I DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT NUMBER.

44:06.912 --> 44:09.948
AND AFTER THAT, GANZEL TELLS ME
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT HER.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.850
SAYS THAT SHE SOUNDED
A LITTLE JINKY.

44:11.883 --> 44:13.952
- IS THAT WHEN GANZEL TOLD YOU
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER?

44:13.985 --> 44:15.821
FOLLOW HER?
- WHAT?

44:15.854 --> 44:17.322
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WHAT--

44:17.355 --> 44:19.357
WHAT, YOU THINK I KILLED HER?
- IT WASN'T CRAGEN.

44:19.390 --> 44:21.927
- 'COURSE IT WASN'T CRAGEN.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.461
CRAGEN GOT SET UP REAL GOOD.

44:23.494 --> 44:24.963
AND SO DID SHE.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.065
- RIGHT, AND YOUR BOSS
SENT HER TO CRAGEN.

44:27.098 --> 44:28.767
- LOOK, MY MONEY--

44:28.800 --> 44:29.968
MY MONEY'S ON DELIA.

44:30.001 --> 44:31.770
- CARISSA
WAS GANZEL'S GIRL.

44:31.803 --> 44:34.706
- CARISSA WAS EVERYBODY'S GIRL!

44:34.740 --> 44:35.774
ALL RIGHT?

44:35.807 --> 44:37.843
GROW UP!

44:37.876 --> 44:43.048
- SO DELIA BLACKMAILS HER
INTO SETTING UP CRAGEN AND ME.

44:43.081 --> 44:46.017
- YOU WERE JUST A COVER STORY,
MAN...ALL RIGHT?

44:46.051 --> 44:48.987
YOU WERE AN EXCUSE FOR HER
TO WORK CRAGEN.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.722
- THEN DELIA DOUBLE-CROSSES HER.

44:50.756 --> 44:54.760
- DELIA DOUBLE-CROSSES
EVERYBODY.

44:54.793 --> 44:56.762
- CASSIDY'S WORKING ON GANZEL
TO COOPERATE.

44:56.795 --> 44:57.763
IF HE I.D.s DELIA'S THUGS,
THEN--

44:57.796 --> 44:59.197
- HE WON'T!

44:59.230 --> 45:01.867
AND DELIA IS TOO SMART
TO HIRE GUYS WHO WILL ROLL OVER.

45:01.900 --> 45:04.202
- MAYBE NOT. I MEAN,
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY

45:04.235 --> 45:05.837
WE'VE GOT LEVERAGE ON.

45:05.871 --> 45:08.373
- THERE WAS: IRIS.
DELIA TOOK CARE OF HER.

45:08.406 --> 45:09.908
- DON'T FORGET ANYA SOLAR.

45:09.941 --> 45:12.210
- MUNCH, NOT HELPING.
- YEAH, BUT HE'S RIGHT.

45:12.243 --> 45:15.847
FIVE MURDERS, AND THE ONLY
PERSON BEING CHARGED IS ME.

45:15.881 --> 45:16.982
SHE'S GOOD.

45:17.015 --> 45:18.817
- WE'RE NOT GIVING UP, CAPTAIN.

45:18.850 --> 45:19.951
TRY AND STAY POSITIVE.

45:19.985 --> 45:23.989
- I DON'T NEED SLOGANS, ROLLINS.

45:24.022 --> 45:26.491
JUST GET ME OUT OF HERE.

45:28.994 --> 45:30.796
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO CASSIDY?

45:30.829 --> 45:33.999
- YESTERDAY. WE WANTED HIM
TO GET GANZEL TO COOPERATE--WHY?

45:34.032 --> 45:36.134
- ONE OF THE BUGS IN GANZEL'S
LOFT WENT DEAD LAST NIGHT.

45:36.167 --> 45:39.838
I LEFT A SIGNAL FOR CASSIDY,
AND HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM.

45:39.871 --> 45:43.208
CAN YOU TRY AND FIND HIM?

45:43.241 --> 45:44.943
- I WILL, YEAH.

45:48.146 --> 45:49.514
[knock at door]

45:49.547 --> 45:50.782
- COMING.

45:58.323 --> 46:01.126
OLIVIA. WHAT'S UP?

46:01.159 --> 46:02.427
- WHAT'S UP?

46:02.460 --> 46:03.829
- MM.

46:03.862 --> 46:05.430
- YOU TELL ME.

46:05.463 --> 46:09.534
- WHAT, YOU WANT TO SEE
MY MEMO BOOK?

46:09.567 --> 46:11.937
- WE'VE LOST CONTACT
WITH CASSIDY.

46:11.970 --> 46:13.238
I TALKED TO HIS MOTHER,
SHE SAID THAT YOU WERE

46:13.271 --> 46:16.875
THE LAST PERSON
THAT HE WAS SEEN WITH.

46:16.908 --> 46:19.177
- I NEEDED SOME ANSWERS.
- YEAH?

46:19.210 --> 46:21.246
IS THAT WHY YOU LOCKED HIM
IN THE MEN'S ROOM?

46:21.279 --> 46:25.917
- IT TURNS OUT HE WAS
HOLDING BACK ABOUT CARISSA.

46:25.951 --> 46:28.253
HE TOLD ME SHE AND GANZEL
HAD A PRIVATE CELL.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.956
GANZEL WAS THE LAST PERSON
SHE SPOKE TO THAT NIGHT.

46:30.989 --> 46:32.123
- AND HE JUST VOLUNTEERED THIS?

46:32.157 --> 46:34.225
- YEAH.

46:34.259 --> 46:36.194
ONCE I PUT A GUN TO HIS HEAD.
- WHAT?

46:36.227 --> 46:38.196
YOU KIDDING ME?

46:38.229 --> 46:39.898
I'M SORRY. NICK,
LET'S TAKE IT OUTSIDE.

46:39.931 --> 46:41.266
I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP
YOUR FAMILY.

46:41.299 --> 46:42.968
- NO, THEY'RE--
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

46:46.271 --> 46:51.209
MARIA, SHE ACCEPTED
A JOB IN D.C.

46:51.242 --> 46:53.311
TOOK ZARA WITH HER.

46:57.448 --> 46:58.616
BUT IT'S--IT'S TEMPORARY.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.085
- NICK, I'M SO SORRY.

47:00.118 --> 47:03.454
- IT'S LATE, AND...

47:03.488 --> 47:05.190
I NEED TO TRY TO SLEEP.

47:11.997 --> 47:14.032
- AND SHOW UP TOMORROW.

47:29.214 --> 47:32.984
- FREEZE!
- WHOA, WHOA!

47:33.018 --> 47:34.652
WHOA, HEY, HEY!
BOSS, IT'S ME.

47:34.685 --> 47:37.222
WHAT THE HELL?
- GET DOWN. HANDS UP.

47:37.255 --> 47:40.491
- REALLY? HOW ABOUT ONE
OR THE OTHER, BOSS, HUH?

47:40.525 --> 47:42.994
- CASSIDY, YOU SCARED THE PISS
OUT OF ME.

47:43.028 --> 47:44.095
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

47:44.129 --> 47:45.330
YOU CALLED ME.

47:45.363 --> 47:47.198
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

47:47.232 --> 47:49.200
- TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS.
I BROUGHT YOU CHINESE FOOD.

47:49.234 --> 47:52.237
GIVE ME THAT.

47:55.373 --> 47:58.209
WHAT DO YOU NEED, HMM?

47:58.243 --> 48:00.211
- THE WAY DELIA GOT TO IRIS
AND CARISSA,

48:00.245 --> 48:02.547
SHE'S ALWAYS ONE STEP AHEAD,
SHE'S GOT SPIES.

48:02.580 --> 48:03.982
- HEY, BOSS, YOU GOT
TO CALM DOWN HERE.

48:04.015 --> 48:05.550
- BUGS. BUGS.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.953
THE LOFT! YOU GOTTA CHECK IT.

48:07.986 --> 48:10.655
A BUG SWEEP. EVERY INCH,
CHOP-CHOP.

48:12.490 --> 48:15.060
- THEY SPENT THE WHOLE DAY,
BOSS, AND THEY CAN'T TELL

48:15.093 --> 48:17.295
JUST FROM THESE LITTLE THINGS
WHERE THEY'RE TRANSMITTING TO.

48:17.328 --> 48:18.529
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD'VE
LEFT THEM ON.

48:18.563 --> 48:19.965
WHOEVER PLANTED THESE THINGS
IS GOING TO KNOW

48:19.998 --> 48:21.199
THAT WE'RE ON TO THEM.

48:21.232 --> 48:23.268
- NO, I NEED PRIVACY
IN MY OWN HOME.

48:23.301 --> 48:24.936
AND WHO THE HELL
DID PLANT THEM?

48:24.970 --> 48:26.571
I HIRED YOU
TO PROVIDE SECURITY.

48:26.604 --> 48:28.073
- I GET THAT YOU'RE UPSET,
BOSS, OKAY?

48:28.106 --> 48:29.274
I GET THAT.

48:29.307 --> 48:30.708
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE COME
THROUGH THIS LOFT.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.243
IT COULD'VE BEEN ANYBODY,
ALL RIGHT?

48:32.277 --> 48:33.411
ONE OF DELIA'S GIRLS.

48:33.444 --> 48:34.679
- HOW LONG WHERE THEY
IN OPERATION?

48:34.712 --> 48:36.247
- I DON'T KNOW.

48:36.281 --> 48:38.216
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHO,
HOW OR WHEN.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.118
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

48:40.151 --> 48:43.721
- WHOA. YOU EITHER TRUST ME
OR YOU DON'T, HUH?

48:43.754 --> 48:46.257
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M JUST--

48:46.291 --> 48:48.226
CARISSA WAS MY ROCK.

48:48.259 --> 48:50.261
- HEY, LOOK.

48:50.295 --> 48:52.697
THERE'S NO TIME TO WALLOW HERE,
OKAY?

48:52.730 --> 48:56.267
IF NYPD PLANTED THOSE BUGS, THEN
WE NEED TO GET IN FRONT OF IT.

48:56.301 --> 48:58.236
I'M OUT ON THE SAME LIMB
YOU ARE, RIGHT?

48:58.269 --> 49:00.305
I'LL CALL THEM.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.509
- WHERE'S YOUR COUNSEL,
MS. WILSON?

49:04.542 --> 49:06.577
- I HAD TO LET MR. EXLEY GO,
YOUR HONOR.

49:06.611 --> 49:10.048
AFTER HE POSTED BOND,
HE SEEMED TO MISUNDERSTAND

49:10.081 --> 49:12.117
THE NATURE
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.

49:12.150 --> 49:15.286
AS I HAVE NO FINANCIAL RESOURCES
TO HIRE ANOTHER ATTORNEY,

49:15.320 --> 49:16.721
I'LL BE REPRESENTING MYSELF.

49:16.754 --> 49:18.723
- IF THIS IS ANOTHER
DELAYING TACTIC--

49:18.756 --> 49:20.291
- NOT AT ALL.

49:20.325 --> 49:23.294
IN LIGHT OF THE TRAGIC SUICIDE
OF IRIS PETERSON,

49:23.328 --> 49:25.396
I'D LIKE TO FILE A MOTION
TO DISMISS.

49:25.430 --> 49:28.099
THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE
A SHRED OF EVIDENCE

49:28.133 --> 49:30.301
TO SUPPORT THE CHARGES
AGAINST ME.

49:30.335 --> 49:32.103
- DOES THE D.A.'S OFFICE STILL
HAVE A CASE, MS. FOSTER?

49:32.137 --> 49:34.272
- YES, YOUR HONOR. WE'RE HOLDING
A MATERIAL WITNESS

49:34.305 --> 49:38.176
TO SEVERAL VIOLENT CRIMES
ORCHESTRATED BY DELIA WILSON,

49:38.209 --> 49:39.744
INCLUDING
WHAT WE INTEND TO PROVE

49:39.777 --> 49:41.479
WAS THE MURDER
OF IRIS PETERSON.

49:41.512 --> 49:43.581
- I RUN A MATCHMAKING BUSINESS.

49:43.614 --> 49:46.117
THESE STRONG-ARM TACTICS
ARE THE D.A.'S ATTEMPT

49:46.151 --> 49:49.254
TO BLACKMAIL ME INTO REVEALING
THE NAMES OF MY CLIENTS.

49:49.287 --> 49:52.357
- WE'RE PURSUING
A CHARGE OF HOMICIDE.

49:52.390 --> 49:55.460
THE M.E.s REPORT RULING
THE CIRCUMSTANCES

49:55.493 --> 49:58.263
OF IRIS PETERSON'S DEATH
UNDETERMINED,

49:58.296 --> 50:00.231
PENDING INVESTIGATION.

50:00.265 --> 50:02.467
- WHICH I'LL BE RETAINING
MY OWN EXPERTS TO REFUTE.

50:02.500 --> 50:06.137
THE M.E., MELINDA WARNER,
HAS A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP

50:06.171 --> 50:09.140
WITH ACCUSED MURDERER
CAPTAIN DONALD CRAGEN,

50:09.174 --> 50:10.708
WHICH HAS BIASED HER FINDINGS.

50:10.741 --> 50:12.710
- RETAIN AWAY, MS. WILSON.
THAT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE.

50:12.743 --> 50:15.246
BUT I'M NOT DISMISSING
THESE CHARGES.

50:19.684 --> 50:21.486
- I'VE ASSURED MY BOSS
THAT SVU PLAYS CLEAN.

50:21.519 --> 50:24.155
- IF MY MAN CASSIDY TELLS ME
TO HAVE FAITH IN YOU DETECTIVES,

50:24.189 --> 50:25.823
I HAVE FAITH.

50:25.856 --> 50:27.258
- OUR ONLY AGENDA
IS TO PROVE

50:27.292 --> 50:29.460
THAT DELIA KILLED
IRIS PETERSON.

50:29.494 --> 50:31.262
- NO OFFENSE, SWEETHEART,
BUT IF YOU COULD NAIL ME TOO,

50:31.296 --> 50:33.198
YOU WOULD.
- WATCH YOURSELF.

50:33.231 --> 50:36.167
- HE MEANT THAT AS
A COMPLIMENT, DETECTIVE.

50:36.201 --> 50:39.170
NOW, IF WE COULD,
LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE.

50:39.204 --> 50:42.173
- WELL, WE UNDERSTAND DELIA SENT
SOME THUGS AROUND

50:42.207 --> 50:43.774
TO THREATEN YOU.

50:43.808 --> 50:44.842
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

50:44.875 --> 50:46.477
- IT WAS A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

50:46.511 --> 50:49.147
THREE GOONS, THICK NECKS,
BIG GUNS.

50:49.180 --> 50:52.150
THEY TOOK BASEBALL BATS
TO MY TVs, MY ARTWORK.

50:52.183 --> 50:54.085
CALLED THEM "P.B.S. STICKS."

50:54.119 --> 50:58.156
- "PIMP, BE SMART."
IT'S A CATCHY ACRONYM.

50:58.189 --> 51:01.292
- THE GENIUSES
FORGOT ONE BAT.

51:01.326 --> 51:03.594
I GOT HERE AFTER THEY LEFT.

51:03.628 --> 51:05.796
I BAGGED ANYTHING
THEY MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED.

51:05.830 --> 51:07.698
YOU'LL PROBABLY
FIND A PRINT.

51:07.732 --> 51:10.235
- HELLO? THIS IS WHY I KEEP
EX-NYPD ON MY PAYROLL.

51:10.268 --> 51:11.769
NEW YORK'S FINEST.

51:11.802 --> 51:13.204
- WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL
THE POLICE?

51:13.238 --> 51:14.705
- WE DIDN'T WANT
TO BOTHER NYPD

51:14.739 --> 51:16.307
WITH SUCH A TRIVIAL MATTER.

51:16.341 --> 51:18.776
- BUT NOW WE'RE TALKING MURDER.

51:18.809 --> 51:21.779
I READ IRIS HAD TWO DAUGHTERS.
HEARTBREAKING.

51:21.812 --> 51:23.281
- WELL, WE'LL NEED THE BAT,
AND WE'LL ALSO NEED YOU

51:23.314 --> 51:24.882
TO TESTIFY AT THE GRAND JURY.

51:24.915 --> 51:26.717
- TESTIFYING AGAINST
DELIA WILSON

51:26.751 --> 51:29.320
WILL PUT MY CLIENT
AT CONSIDERABLE RISK.

51:29.354 --> 51:33.558
THE BIGGER THE RISK,
THE BIGGER THE REWARD.

51:33.591 --> 51:36.261
- BART GANZEL THINKS
HE'S GONNA GET FULL IMMUNITY?

51:36.294 --> 51:38.696
HE WANTS US TO THROW OUT
THREE YEARS OF WIRETAPS?

51:38.729 --> 51:40.398
SCREW HIM.
- HOLD ON.

51:40.431 --> 51:44.235
HE NEEDS SOMETHING TO RESTORE
HIS FAITH IN CASSIDY.

51:44.269 --> 51:45.536
- COUNSELOR.

51:45.570 --> 51:49.607
- [sighs]
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST, DETECTIVES?

51:49.640 --> 51:52.277
- OKAY, SO THE FIRST MURDER,
RIGHT?

51:52.310 --> 51:54.579
MAGGIE MURPHY
AT THE BACHELOR PARTY.

51:54.612 --> 51:58.783
NOW, WE KNOW THAT WAS DELIA
AND ANYA SETTING GANZEL UP.

51:58.816 --> 52:02.353
- SO GIVE HIM A PASS ON THAT,
BEFORE DELIA CATCHES WIND

52:02.387 --> 52:04.289
THAT GANZEL'S COOPERATING.

52:04.322 --> 52:07.225
- OKAY, I GET IT, DETECTIVES.

52:07.258 --> 52:12.297
LET'S JUST HOPE GANZEL
HAS SOMETHING REAL.

52:12.330 --> 52:13.198
- WE MATCHED THREE SETS
OF PRINTS.

52:13.231 --> 52:14.865
TWO OF DELIA'S THUGS SKIPPED

52:14.899 --> 52:17.302
AN HOUR BEFORE THE D.A.'S
INVESTIGATORS GOT THERE.

52:17.335 --> 52:19.437
- BUT THE THIRD ONE
HAD PACKED HIS BAGS,

52:19.470 --> 52:21.172
TOLD HIS WIFE HE WAS FLYING
DOWN TO MEXICO CITY,

52:21.206 --> 52:23.541
BUT INSTEAD SPENT THE NIGHT
WITH HIS LITTLE SIDE PIECE

52:23.574 --> 52:24.942
AT SOME
HOT-SHEET AIRPORT MOTEL,

52:24.975 --> 52:27.545
WHERE HE WAS ARRESTED
THIS MORNING.

52:27.578 --> 52:29.714
- SANS CULOTTES?
BEAUTIFUL.

52:29.747 --> 52:33.751
- AND HIS LOVER'S TALKING?
- NOT YET.

52:33.784 --> 52:36.354
- WELL, THERE'S ONE WAY
TO UP THE PRESSURE.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.626
GANZEL'S GOOD
I.D.ing THIS GUY?

52:41.659 --> 52:43.494
- YEAH. THE EMPEROR
JUST NEEDS A MINUTE.

52:43.528 --> 52:45.596
HE'S BEEN
A LITTLE ITCHY LATELY.

52:45.630 --> 52:48.366
- HE FOUND BUGS, CASSIDY.

52:48.399 --> 52:49.834
YOU NEED TO END THIS.

52:49.867 --> 52:52.537
- LIV, I PUT IN THREE YEARS.

52:52.570 --> 52:54.205
I'M NOT PULLING OUT NOW.

52:54.239 --> 52:55.640
YOU WANT TO HELP ME?

52:55.673 --> 52:57.442
YOU TELL YOUR IDIOT PARTNER
TO KEEP IT IN HIS PANTS.

52:57.475 --> 52:59.544
- I ALREADY DID. LOOK,
HE'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.

52:59.577 --> 53:01.346
- AND I'M NOT?
COME ON, LIV.

53:01.379 --> 53:03.248
GANZEL GOES
ON A PARANOID COKE BINGE,

53:03.281 --> 53:05.250
AND BUTCH BOY PULLS A GUN ON ME
WITH MY MOM--

53:05.283 --> 53:07.452
- IT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

53:07.485 --> 53:09.287
- SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU TWO, LIV?

53:09.320 --> 53:10.955
- DON'T BE AN ASS.
- DO YOU TWO NEED A ROOM?

53:10.988 --> 53:14.525
- NO, WE'RE ALL GOOD.
LET'S ROLL, BOSS.

53:14.559 --> 53:16.294
- CASSIDY, YOU DRIVE
WITH GANZEL.

53:16.327 --> 53:18.329
I'LL FOLLOW.
- YOU DON'T TRUST ME TO SHOW UP?

53:18.363 --> 53:20.365
- NYPD, THEY GET A LITTLE
ANXIOUS.

53:20.398 --> 53:23.301
HEY. HEY, MORON.
GET AWAY FROM THE CAR.

53:23.334 --> 53:24.835
- POLICE! STOP! POLICE!

53:24.869 --> 53:27.305
- HEY DO YOU HEAR ME?
I SAID BACK UP.

53:27.338 --> 53:28.506
- OR WHAT?
- STOP! NYPD!

53:28.539 --> 53:30.007
- YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT, PAL.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.676
- YOU BACK OFF,
OR I'LL SHOOT HIM.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.644
- NOT--NOT NECESSARY.
- STOP!

53:36.046 --> 53:37.982
- DROP THE GUN!
[siren wailing]

53:38.015 --> 53:39.517
- YOU DROP YOUR GUN!

53:39.550 --> 53:41.386
- GET BACK AGAINST THE POLE.

53:41.419 --> 53:43.454
- PUT THE GUN DOWN.
- YOU PUT YOURS DOWN.

53:43.488 --> 53:45.256
- POLICE! DON'T MOVE!

53:45.290 --> 53:46.391
- POLICE! DON'T SHOOT!
I'M ON THE JOB!

53:46.424 --> 53:47.925
- I'M ON THE JOB!

53:47.958 --> 53:49.427
- DON'T MOVE!
BOTH OF YOU, DROP IT!

53:49.460 --> 53:51.429
- NO, I'M ON THE JOB!
- I SAID FREEZE!

53:51.462 --> 53:53.564
- I'M A COP. I'M ON THE JOB.
- POLICE! POLICE! ON THE JOB.

53:53.598 --> 53:55.032
DON'T SHOOT. DON'T SHOOT.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.868
- LIV, GET B--
LIV, GET BACK!

53:57.902 --> 54:00.571
- NO! NO!

54:00.605 --> 54:03.341
CASSIDY, CASSIDY.

54:03.374 --> 54:06.277
10-13, 10-13, OFFICER DOWN,
OFFICER DOWN.

54:06.311 --> 54:07.778
VANDAM AND VARICK.

54:07.812 --> 54:09.914
A P.O. WAS SHOT.

54:09.947 --> 54:12.016
CASSIDY.
OH, MY GOD.

54:12.049 --> 54:13.684
CALL A BUS!

54:20.057 --> 54:22.660
[sirens wailing]

54:22.693 --> 54:24.995
- STAY WITH ME,
CASSIDY, OKAY?

54:25.029 --> 54:27.365
YOU HANG IN THERE.
[monitor beeping]

54:27.398 --> 54:28.966
WE'RE GONNA BE THERE SOON,
OKAY?

54:28.999 --> 54:30.735
[monitor flatlines]

54:30.768 --> 54:33.738
DO SOMETHING.
- WE LOST HIM.

54:33.771 --> 54:34.805
CLEAR.

54:34.839 --> 54:36.507
[defibrillator thumps]

54:37.875 --> 54:39.944
- LIV, YOU OKAY?
- CASSIDY GOT HIT, TWICE.

54:39.977 --> 54:40.778
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

54:40.811 --> 54:43.381
- HE GOT SHOT BY A UNI,
SOME ROOKIE.

54:43.414 --> 54:44.882
- DID CASSIDY I.D. HIMSELF?

54:44.915 --> 54:47.352
- YES, BUT THE UNI
MUST'VE PANICKED OR--

54:47.385 --> 54:49.620
- OR WHAT? WHAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

54:49.654 --> 54:51.956
- I.A.B. WANTS YOUR STATEMENT.

54:51.989 --> 54:53.758
- THEY SHOULD QUESTION
THE SHOOTER FIRST.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.393
- THEY NEED TO TALK
TO YOU TOO.

54:55.426 --> 54:57.495
- AFTER I SEE HOW HE'S DOING.

54:59.564 --> 55:02.933
WHEN CASSIDY AND I WORKED
TOGETHER, WE HAD THIS, UH...

55:02.967 --> 55:04.435
MOMENT.

55:04.469 --> 55:05.703
I DIDN'T HANDLE IT WELL.

55:05.736 --> 55:07.037
- THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

55:07.071 --> 55:09.607
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T HOLD THAT
AGAINST YOU.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.776
- NO, HE PROBABLY DOES.

55:11.809 --> 55:13.911
- BULLET MISSED THE ARTERY,
BUT IT GOT THE SPLEEN.

55:13.944 --> 55:15.646
HE'S STILL IN SURGERY.
[cell phone ringing]

55:15.680 --> 55:16.914
- BUT HE'S GONNA PULL THROUGH.

55:16.947 --> 55:18.015
- DOCTORS ARE LIKE COPS.

55:18.048 --> 55:20.518
THEY DON'T LIKE
TO MAKE PROMISES.

55:20.551 --> 55:23.754
- HARRIS.
- I WANT TO SEE MY MAN.

55:23.788 --> 55:25.423
DETECTIVE BENSON,
HOW'S HE DOING? GONNA BE OKAY?

55:25.456 --> 55:27.057
- THEY'RE DOING
THE BEST THEY CAN.

55:27.091 --> 55:28.526
- I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS.

55:28.559 --> 55:29.927
I KNOW PEOPLE, CARDIOLOGISTS.

55:29.960 --> 55:31.462
GET A SECOND OPINION,
WHATEVER HE NEEDS.

55:31.496 --> 55:32.730
PRIVATE ROOM, THE BEST.

55:32.763 --> 55:34.031
I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

55:34.064 --> 55:35.366
- THAT'S VERY GENEROUS
OF YOU.

55:35.400 --> 55:36.901
- I'M OUT OF MY MIND HERE.
THOSE--

55:36.934 --> 55:38.803
THOSE PUNKS.

55:38.836 --> 55:40.605
CASSIDY TOOK A BULLET
FOR ME.

55:40.638 --> 55:42.873
THE GUY'S EX-NYPD,
GETS SHOT BY HIS OWN TEAM.

55:42.907 --> 55:44.041
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

55:44.074 --> 55:45.776
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU

55:45.810 --> 55:47.578
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.
- THAT'S GOOD.

55:47.612 --> 55:49.046
HE'S GOT ALL OF YOU
ON HIS SIDE STILL.

55:49.079 --> 55:50.381
THAT'S LOYALTY.

55:50.415 --> 55:51.682
- BENSON.

55:54.184 --> 55:55.686
I.A.B. WANTS
TO SEE YOU NOW.

55:55.720 --> 55:56.987
THEY SAID IT'S GOOD
IF I COME ALONG.

55:57.021 --> 55:59.490
- LOOK, I, UH,
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY

55:59.524 --> 56:01.426
TO HOLD MY HAND, SO...

56:01.459 --> 56:04.462
- NOT YOUR CALL.

56:07.698 --> 56:08.966
- THAT'S THE SHOOTER.
WHO IS SHE?

56:08.999 --> 56:11.068
- ALANA GONZALEZ.
TWO YEARS WITH THE 11TH.

56:11.101 --> 56:12.937
CLEAN SHEET.
FIRST TIME FIRING HER WEAPON.

56:12.970 --> 56:14.872
- YEAH, AND HER LAST.
IT WAS A BAD SHOOTING.

56:14.905 --> 56:16.941
- MY JOB, NOT YOURS.

56:16.974 --> 56:20.645
- TELL HIM WHAT YOU SAW.

56:20.678 --> 56:24.782
- TWO MALE BLACKS,
ONE YOUNGER, ONE OLDER, BALD.

56:24.815 --> 56:27.485
THE YOUNG ONE BOLTS.
I GIVE CHASE.

56:27.518 --> 56:29.053
THE OLDER ONE PULLS HIS WEAPON
ON GANZEL.

56:29.086 --> 56:30.955
CASSIDY DRAWS HIS GUN.

56:30.988 --> 56:32.490
- DID YOU SEE
THE OFFICERS ARRIVE?

56:32.523 --> 56:34.158
- I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE.

56:34.191 --> 56:37.628
AND THE RADIO CAR, I MUST SAY,
ARRIVED EXCEPTIONALLY FAST.

56:37.662 --> 56:39.163
- SO CASSIDY'S GUN
WAS DRAWN.

56:39.196 --> 56:41.131
DID THEY TELL HIM TO FREEZE?

56:41.165 --> 56:44.001
- HE SHOUTED,
"I'M ON THE JOB."

56:44.034 --> 56:46.771
I CAME RUNNING BACK,
ARMS UP, SCREAMING,

56:46.804 --> 56:48.673
"DON'T SHOOT.
DON'T SHOOT."

56:48.706 --> 56:53.210
AND GONZALEZ SHOT CASSIDY TWICE
AT POINT-BLANK RANGE.

56:53.243 --> 56:56.681
- DID YOU SEE HIM FREEZE?

56:56.714 --> 56:58.015
- I CAN'T SWEAR TO THAT,
BUT I KNOW THAT--

56:58.048 --> 56:59.049
- GONZALEZ AND HER PARTNER
BOTH CLAIM

56:59.083 --> 57:01.552
THEY WERE IN IMMINENT DANGER.

57:01.586 --> 57:03.020
- WELL, THEY'RE LYING.

57:03.053 --> 57:04.589
I MEAN,
THOSE GUYS JUST HAPPENED

57:04.622 --> 57:07.057
TO BE BREAKING
INTO GANZEL'S CAR

57:07.091 --> 57:09.059
RIGHT WHEN WE COME DOWN?

57:09.093 --> 57:10.961
THE COPS ARRIVE THAT FAST.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

57:10.995 --> 57:13.564
- BENSON, JUST LET I.A.B.
DO THEIR INVESTIGATION.

57:13.598 --> 57:15.566
- DID YOU INTERVIEW
THE CAR THIEVES?

57:15.600 --> 57:17.034
- NO, THE KID YOU CAUGHT
LAWYERED UP.

57:17.067 --> 57:19.069
- OH, WELL,
I WONDER WHO'S PAYING.

57:19.103 --> 57:21.205
DID YOU CHECK
THE OFFICERS' FINANCIALS?

57:21.238 --> 57:24.742
HUH?

57:24.775 --> 57:25.943
- CAN WE HAVE THE ROOM?

57:38.255 --> 57:40.057
- YOU'RE GONNA LET
I.A.B. HANDLE THIS?

57:40.090 --> 57:41.792
- THAT'S THE PROTOCOL.
THEY'LL PIECE IT TOGETHER.

57:41.826 --> 57:42.893
IF THIS WAS A SETUP--

57:42.927 --> 57:44.962
- IF?

57:44.995 --> 57:48.032
BOTH OFFICERS USED THE PHRASE
"IMMINENT DANGER."

57:48.065 --> 57:50.535
THEY'RE BEING COACHED.

57:50.568 --> 57:53.871
- OKAY. SO YOU SAY
THAT THESE ROOKIE COPS

57:53.904 --> 57:55.773
WERE PAID TO KILL
ONE OF OUR OWN.

57:55.806 --> 57:59.610
- I'M SAYING THAT GANZEL
MADE CASSIDY.

57:59.644 --> 58:02.947
HE SET HIM UP.

58:02.980 --> 58:06.016
- TIMELINE MAKES SENSE.

58:06.050 --> 58:08.052
THAT KID YOU CAUGHT, YOUNG?

58:08.085 --> 58:12.590
- BARELY SHAVING.

58:12.623 --> 58:15.626
- MAYBE I.A.B. ISN'T
THE WAY TO GO.

58:21.098 --> 58:23.100
[door lock buzzes]

58:30.641 --> 58:33.010
- THEY SAID I HAD A VISITOR.

58:33.043 --> 58:34.845
I KNOW YOU?

58:34.879 --> 58:38.849
- THAT GUY THAT GOT SHOT,
HE'S A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.

58:42.152 --> 58:44.622
- YO, I AIN'T HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

58:44.655 --> 58:45.923
- I KNOW,
YOU WERE JUST TRYING

58:45.956 --> 58:47.958
TO STEAL SOME WHEELS,
HASDRUBAL.

58:47.992 --> 58:50.861
BUT YOU KNOW HOW
NYPD AND D.O.C. GET

58:50.895 --> 58:52.897
WHEN ONE OF OUR OWN
GETS SHOT.

58:52.930 --> 58:58.135
- YEAH, I'M STARTING
TO FIND THAT OUT.

58:58.168 --> 59:00.237
YO, I SWEAR, I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS A COP.

59:00.270 --> 59:02.306
- JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR.

59:02.339 --> 59:05.242
TELL ME WHAT YOU DID KNOW.

59:05.275 --> 59:07.778
THAT PUNK HASDRUBAL TOLD ME
HE JUST STARTED WORKING

59:07.812 --> 59:09.614
FOR THAT CAR THEFT RING.

59:09.647 --> 59:12.617
THAT MORNING, HE GOT A TIP
TO STAND BY FOR A ROLLS.

59:12.650 --> 59:15.319
- HEY.

59:18.656 --> 59:20.891
LOOK, YOU EITHER TRUST ME,
OR YOU DON'T.

59:20.925 --> 59:21.959
- SIT DOWN, NICK.
COME ON.

59:21.992 --> 59:23.728
- YEAH.

59:23.761 --> 59:25.863
- [sighs]

59:25.896 --> 59:26.997
HOW'S CASSIDY?

59:27.031 --> 59:28.332
- HE'S SEDATED,

59:28.365 --> 59:30.067
BUT HE'S
OUT OF CRITICAL CONDITION.

59:30.100 --> 59:33.671
- THAT COULD'VE BEEN YOU
THAT GOT SHOT.

59:33.704 --> 59:38.242
I MEAN, WE ALL GOT TO WATCH
EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

59:38.275 --> 59:41.278
- SO THIS SHOOTING,
IT WAS A SETUP?

59:41.311 --> 59:42.847
- HASDRUBAL GOT A "GO" CALL

59:42.880 --> 59:44.782
TWO MINUTES BEFORE CASSIDY
STEPPED OUTSIDE

59:44.815 --> 59:47.284
FROM THIS NUMBER,
A NO-NAME CELL.

59:47.317 --> 59:48.953
- AND I'M BETTING
THAT OFFICER GONZALEZ

59:48.986 --> 59:51.922
GOT THE SAME "GO" CALL
RIGHT AFTER THAT ONE.

59:51.956 --> 59:53.390
- SO THE NIGHT CARISSA
WAS KILLED,

59:53.423 --> 59:55.693
SHE CALLED NICK,
SHE CALLED THE SQUAD ROOM,

59:55.726 --> 59:57.695
AND SHE CALLED CASSIDY ONCE.

59:57.728 --> 1:00:01.732
BUT THERE WAS A NUMBER
THAT WE COULDN'T TRACE.

1:00:01.766 --> 1:00:04.735
BINGO.
NUMBER MATCHES THE "GO" CALL.

1:00:04.769 --> 1:00:06.971
- WELL, CASSIDY TOLD ME
CARISSA CALLED GANZEL THAT NIGHT

1:00:07.004 --> 1:00:08.038
ON HIS PRIVATE CELL.

1:00:08.072 --> 1:00:09.339
YOU WANT TO BET THAT'S IT?

1:00:09.373 --> 1:00:10.975
- GANZEL SET UP
HIS OWN CARJACKING.

1:00:11.008 --> 1:00:12.677
HE MADE BOTH OF THOSE CALLS

1:00:12.710 --> 1:00:14.078
WHEN CASSIDY AND I
WERE WAITING FOR HIM.

1:00:14.111 --> 1:00:16.714
- SO THESE ROOKIES,
THEY GIVE ANYTHING TO I.A.B.?

1:00:16.747 --> 1:00:17.915
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1:00:17.948 --> 1:00:19.917
- FRIENDLY FIRE,
THAT'S BAD ENOUGH.

1:00:19.950 --> 1:00:22.152
BUT A PREARRANGED HIT
ON A U.C.?

1:00:22.186 --> 1:00:24.221
WE'RE ON OUR OWN.

1:00:28.025 --> 1:00:29.960
- THAT'S GOTTA BE HER.

1:00:29.994 --> 1:00:31.862
- OFFICER GONZALEZ?

1:00:31.896 --> 1:00:35.099
CAN WE TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

1:00:35.132 --> 1:00:37.201
- I'M WITH MY SISTER.

1:00:37.234 --> 1:00:39.236
- WELL, WE CAN DO THIS HERE,

1:00:39.269 --> 1:00:42.272
OR WE CAN TAKE A WALK.

1:00:50.047 --> 1:00:51.281
- ARE YOU WITH I.A.B.?
I ALREADY SPOKE--

1:00:51.315 --> 1:00:54.051
- NO, WE'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

1:00:54.084 --> 1:00:57.087
THE COP YOU SHOT, HE DIED.

1:01:00.858 --> 1:01:02.860
- I TOLD I.A.B.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS A COP.

1:01:02.893 --> 1:01:04.762
- THEN YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO DIDN'T.

1:01:04.795 --> 1:01:06.063
THIS WAS A HIT.

1:01:06.096 --> 1:01:07.765
ONE OF THE CAR THIEVES
TOLD US EVERYTHING.

1:01:07.798 --> 1:01:09.099
- THOSE TWO PIECES OF CRAP.

1:01:09.133 --> 1:01:11.101
OF COURSE THEY'RE GONNA SAY
COPS DID IT.

1:01:11.135 --> 1:01:14.004
- YOU'RE FACING A MURDER CHARGE
ON A FELLOW OFFICER.

1:01:14.038 --> 1:01:15.305
- I SHOULD CALL MY P.B.A.
DELEGATE.

1:01:15.339 --> 1:01:18.475
- YEAH, DO THAT.
THEY REALLY LIKE COP KILLERS.

1:01:18.508 --> 1:01:20.978
BECAUSE YOU CROSSED
A LINE HERE, OFFICER.

1:01:21.011 --> 1:01:22.112
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU UNDERSTAND

1:01:22.146 --> 1:01:23.948
EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE
RIGHT NOW.

1:01:23.981 --> 1:01:26.450
YOU PULLED THE TRIGGER.

1:01:26.483 --> 1:01:31.021
- LOOK, ALANA, WE KNOW
THIS WASN'T YOUR IDEA.

1:01:31.055 --> 1:01:34.925
YOU REALLY WANNA
TAKE ALL THE WEIGHT?

1:01:34.959 --> 1:01:36.827
CUANTOS ANOS TU TIENES?

1:01:36.861 --> 1:01:39.997
VEINTICUATRO?

1:01:40.030 --> 1:01:43.333
YOUR LIFE WOULD BE OVER.

1:01:47.171 --> 1:01:51.308
BUENA SUERTE.

1:01:51.341 --> 1:01:54.411
- WAIT!

1:01:57.081 --> 1:01:59.049
- SO AFTER ROLL CALL,

1:01:59.083 --> 1:02:01.418
GONZALEZ'S SERGEANT,
TED KOUNDAK, PULLS HER ASIDE.

1:02:01.451 --> 1:02:05.089
HE SAYS, "WE HAVE A TIP
ON A CAR RING."

1:02:05.122 --> 1:02:07.057
HE SHOWS HER CASSIDY'S PHOTO,

1:02:07.091 --> 1:02:10.027
HE SAYS THAT HE'S ARMED
AND DANGEROUS,

1:02:10.060 --> 1:02:13.363
AND THAT IF SHE TAKES HIM OUT,
SHE'LL GET HER SHIELD.

1:02:13.397 --> 1:02:15.199
- AND GONZALEZ BELIEVED HIM?

1:02:15.232 --> 1:02:17.234
- WELL, WE LEFT OUT
TWO THINGS.

1:02:17.267 --> 1:02:21.872
KOUNDAK IS HER RABBI,
AND SHE'S SLEEPING WITH HIM.

1:02:21.906 --> 1:02:24.041
- THAT I BELIEVE.

1:02:24.074 --> 1:02:27.044
- SO THIS SERGEANT KOUNDAK,

1:02:27.077 --> 1:02:29.013
HIS NAME EVER COME UP
ON THE WIRETAPS?

1:02:29.046 --> 1:02:30.147
[cell phone beeps]
- I'D HAVE TO CHECK.

1:02:30.180 --> 1:02:32.049
IT WAS THREE YEARS.

1:02:32.082 --> 1:02:36.520
CASSIDY'S OUT OF THE WOODS.
GO SEE IF HE CAN MAKE HIM.

1:02:36.553 --> 1:02:39.223
- TED KOUNDAK, THAT SCHMUCK.

1:02:39.256 --> 1:02:40.858
HE USED TO HANG AROUND
A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW.

1:02:40.891 --> 1:02:43.427
HE HAD A THING
FOR SPANISH GIRLS.

1:02:43.460 --> 1:02:45.029
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME
THAT HE PAID THAT CHICK

1:02:45.062 --> 1:02:47.064
TO PUT TWO BULLETS IN ME?

1:02:47.097 --> 1:02:49.934
- GANZEL CALLED IN A FAVOR.

1:02:49.967 --> 1:02:52.402
- GANZEL?
- YEAH.

1:02:52.436 --> 1:02:53.938
- BUT GANZEL PAID
FOR THESE FLOWERS.

1:02:53.971 --> 1:02:54.972
HE PAID FOR THIS ROOM.

1:02:55.005 --> 1:02:56.974
- CASSIDY...

1:02:57.007 --> 1:02:59.043
- OW. OW.
- GANZEL MADE YOU.

1:02:59.076 --> 1:03:00.477
YOU OKAY?

1:03:00.510 --> 1:03:02.112
- YEAH, BUT I MEAN,
CAN YOU BLAME THE GUY?

1:03:02.146 --> 1:03:04.148
I MEAN, REALLY.
THOSE BUGS.

1:03:04.181 --> 1:03:07.417
STUPID BUGS.

1:03:07.451 --> 1:03:11.088
- YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD FOSTER.

1:03:11.121 --> 1:03:12.923
- NO WAY.

1:03:12.957 --> 1:03:14.992
SHE WOULD'VE JUST PULLED ME IN.
AND THEN WHAT?

1:03:15.025 --> 1:03:18.996
I GO BACK TO INVESTIGATING
DRY CLEANER BREAK-INS?

1:03:19.029 --> 1:03:21.465
I'M LIKE YOU, LIV.

1:03:21.498 --> 1:03:23.000
[groans]

1:03:23.033 --> 1:03:26.036
THIS JOB IS
THE ONLY THING I GOT.

1:03:30.374 --> 1:03:34.611
- I'M NOT WHO I USED TO BE.

1:03:34.644 --> 1:03:38.048
- SURE YOU ARE.

1:03:38.082 --> 1:03:40.084
- NO.

1:03:40.117 --> 1:03:41.818
I'M NOT.

1:03:52.096 --> 1:03:54.098
- THAT WAS NICE.

1:03:54.131 --> 1:03:56.566
[chuckles]

1:03:56.600 --> 1:04:00.204
- SOMETHING ABOUT A MAN
IN A HOSPITAL BED.

1:04:00.237 --> 1:04:03.240
- OKAY, FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.

1:04:09.346 --> 1:04:11.548
- YOU THINK CASSIDY'S
UNDERCOVER, YOU FIRE HIM.

1:04:11.581 --> 1:04:13.050
YOU DON'T SHOOT HIM.

1:04:13.083 --> 1:04:14.518
WHAT, YOU THOUGHT KOUNDAK
WOULD STAY LOYAL?

1:04:14.551 --> 1:04:15.953
- YEAH, FRIGGIN' ARMENIAN.

1:04:15.986 --> 1:04:17.087
GIVE ME A HAND WITH THIS.

1:04:17.121 --> 1:04:19.056
- [scoffs]
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1:04:19.089 --> 1:04:20.524
- ISRAEL, MY HOMELAND.

1:04:20.557 --> 1:04:23.961
- MAZEL TOV.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

1:04:23.994 --> 1:04:27.331
- GET ME ON A PRIVATE JET, BOAT,
FRIGGIN' BICYCLE.

1:04:27.364 --> 1:04:28.899
- CALM DOWN.

1:04:28.933 --> 1:04:32.036
MY ADVICE,
TURN YOURSELF IN QUIETLY.

1:04:32.069 --> 1:04:34.304
- YOU KNOW WHAT, BARRY?
THAT ADVICE SUCKS.

1:04:34.338 --> 1:04:37.141
SOMETHING ELSE--I GO DOWN,
YOU GO DOWN WITH ME.

1:04:37.174 --> 1:04:38.642
- BART.
- WHAT?

1:04:38.675 --> 1:04:41.345
- POLICE.

1:04:41.378 --> 1:04:43.480
- JOY, YOU LET THEM IN?

1:04:43.513 --> 1:04:45.983
- BART GANZEL,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

1:04:46.016 --> 1:04:48.652
PROMOTING PROSTITUTION,
BRIBERY--

1:04:48.685 --> 1:04:51.388
- LOOK, WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

1:04:51.421 --> 1:04:56.093
- YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

1:04:56.126 --> 1:04:59.129
- HEY, THAT'S MY PARTNER!

1:05:01.131 --> 1:05:03.533
NOW, BART,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

1:05:03.567 --> 1:05:05.102
- [chuckles]

1:05:10.340 --> 1:05:11.341
- TODAY MARKS
THE CULMINATION

1:05:11.375 --> 1:05:13.077
OF A THREE-YEAR INVESTIGATION

1:05:13.110 --> 1:05:15.145
INTO BART GANZEL'S
ILLEGAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISES.

1:05:15.179 --> 1:05:17.014
WE INTEND TO BRING
MULTIPLE CHARGES,

1:05:17.047 --> 1:05:19.116
INCLUDING THE ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER.

1:05:19.149 --> 1:05:21.085
- WHICH MY CLIENT WILL BE
PLEADING NOT GUILTY TO

1:05:21.118 --> 1:05:22.686
ON ALL COUNTS, YOUR HONOR.

1:05:22.719 --> 1:05:25.155
- I WOULDN'T EXPECT
ANYTHING LESS, MR. QUERNS.

1:05:25.189 --> 1:05:27.191
- THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

1:05:27.224 --> 1:05:29.026
- PEOPLE ON BAIL.
- WE REQUEST REMAND.

1:05:29.059 --> 1:05:31.495
MR. GANZEL WAS APPREHENDED
WHILE ATTEMPTING TO FLEE.

1:05:31.528 --> 1:05:33.630
- HE WAS ARRESTED
WHEN IN RESIDENCE.

1:05:33.663 --> 1:05:36.333
HE IS PERFECTLY WILLING
TO SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT.

1:05:36.366 --> 1:05:38.468
- WE ALSO HAVE EVIDENCE
THAT MR. QUERNS

1:05:38.502 --> 1:05:40.137
IS PART OF THE CONSPIRACY.

1:05:40.170 --> 1:05:42.372
WE WILL BE MOVING TO HAVE HIM
REMOVED AS COUNSEL.

1:05:42.406 --> 1:05:44.108
- ONE STEP AT A TIME.

1:05:44.141 --> 1:05:47.111
PENDING MR. GANZEL AGREEING
TO HOUSE ARREST

1:05:47.144 --> 1:05:48.545
AND ELECTRONIC MONITORING--

1:05:48.578 --> 1:05:50.747
- YOUR HONOR, HIS HOUSE
IS A HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION.

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:53.050
- BAIL IS SET AT 200,000.

1:05:53.083 --> 1:05:56.086
[bangs gavel]

1:05:56.120 --> 1:05:58.022
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.
I MADE BAIL.

1:05:58.055 --> 1:05:59.356
- THEY HAVE TO PROCESS YOU,
BART.

1:05:59.389 --> 1:06:01.091
IT'S ALL ROUTINE.

1:06:01.125 --> 1:06:02.392
- EASY, EASY.

1:06:02.426 --> 1:06:04.194
I HAVE BURSITIS
IN THIS SHOULDER.

1:06:06.196 --> 1:06:08.032
- YOUR CLIENT'S
A PIECE OF WORK.

1:06:08.065 --> 1:06:10.534
- IF THAT THREAT TO HAVE ME
REMOVED AS MR. GANZEL'S COUNSEL

1:06:10.567 --> 1:06:12.169
WAS AN OPENING SALVO,

1:06:12.202 --> 1:06:15.439
I'LL BURY PUBLIC INTEGRITY
IN SO MANY MOTIONS,

1:06:15.472 --> 1:06:19.776
IT'LL MAKE VESUVIUS LOOK LIKE
AN EARLY AUTUMN FLURRY.

1:06:19.809 --> 1:06:23.013
- WELCOME TO POMPEII.

1:06:25.082 --> 1:06:27.384
- AN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
FOR MAGGIE MURPHY?

1:06:27.417 --> 1:06:30.054
I NEVER HIRED THAT POOR GIRL.
I NEVER EVEN MET HER.

1:06:30.087 --> 1:06:32.189
- YEAH, BUT YOU DID
EXECUTE CONTRACTS

1:06:32.222 --> 1:06:35.125
FOR ALL THE OTHER GIRLS GANZEL
SUPPLIED TO THE, UH, BACCHANAL.

1:06:35.159 --> 1:06:38.328
- ENTERTAINERS.
ALL LEGAL, NO ONE UNDERAGE.

1:06:38.362 --> 1:06:40.364
- D.A.'S HAVING TROUBLE TAKING
YOUR WORD FOR IT.

1:06:40.397 --> 1:06:42.066
- THIS IS JUST A PRETEXT

1:06:42.099 --> 1:06:44.434
TO SEARCH MY RECORDS, MY FILES,
MY CLIENTS' FILES.

1:06:44.468 --> 1:06:46.036
- WE'RE LOOKING
FOR ONE DOCUMENT.

1:06:46.070 --> 1:06:47.304
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.

1:06:47.337 --> 1:06:48.772
EMAIL, HARD DRIVE.

1:06:48.805 --> 1:06:50.307
SHE WANTS TO GO
THROUGH IT ALL.

1:06:50.340 --> 1:06:51.641
- YOU MEAN SHE WANTS TO PUT ME
OUT OF WORK

1:06:51.675 --> 1:06:53.443
UNTIL I COOPERATE.

1:06:53.477 --> 1:06:56.613
STOP THIS INQUISITION.

1:06:56.646 --> 1:06:59.683
I'LL SPEAK WITH YOUR D.A.

1:06:59.716 --> 1:07:03.353
- MR. QUERNS, WE HAVE THREE
YEARS OF YOU ON WIRETAPS,

1:07:03.387 --> 1:07:06.590
HELPING MR. GANZEL RUN
HIS BUSINESS, HIDE HIS CASH,

1:07:06.623 --> 1:07:08.592
EDIT HIS ADS TO MAINTAIN
THE ILLUSION

1:07:08.625 --> 1:07:10.160
HE RAN AN ESCORT SERVICE.

1:07:10.194 --> 1:07:11.661
LET ME BE CLEAR.

1:07:11.695 --> 1:07:14.431
YOU ARE A TARGET
OF THIS INVESTIGATION AS WELL.

1:07:14.464 --> 1:07:16.433
AND YOU CAN SEE
WHERE THIS GOES.

1:07:16.466 --> 1:07:17.667
- YET HERE I AM.

1:07:17.701 --> 1:07:20.404
THREE YEARS' WORTH OF TAPES.

1:07:20.437 --> 1:07:23.107
WHAT MORE COULD YOU
POSSIBLY WANT?

1:07:23.140 --> 1:07:25.675
- WE HAVE YOU AND GANZEL
ON RACKETEERING.

1:07:25.709 --> 1:07:28.078
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
ON THE FORMER GOVERNOR'S MURDER.

1:07:28.112 --> 1:07:29.513
- I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT.

1:07:29.546 --> 1:07:33.850
- YEAH, BUT GANZEL DOES.
AND HE TRUSTS YOU.

1:07:33.883 --> 1:07:36.620
- I'M SURE YOU'RE NOT
TELLING ME

1:07:36.653 --> 1:07:38.655
TO BETRAY
A CLIENT'S TRUST.

1:07:38.688 --> 1:07:40.857
- OF COURSE NOT.

1:07:40.890 --> 1:07:43.093
- BUT HE IS A LIABILITY.

1:07:43.127 --> 1:07:45.195
YOU WON'T JUST LOSE
YOUR LICENSE.

1:07:45.229 --> 1:07:46.330
YOU'LL GO TO PRISON.

1:07:46.363 --> 1:07:48.265
- I BELIEVE IN LOYALTY.

1:07:48.298 --> 1:07:51.201
- YEAH, WELL, YOUR CLIENT,
NOT SO MUCH.

1:07:51.235 --> 1:07:54.671
YOU KNOW, THIS RESPECT THAT
YOU'RE PAYING HIM--

1:07:54.704 --> 1:07:56.506
YOU SHOULD HEAR THE THINGS
THAT HE SAYS

1:07:56.540 --> 1:07:58.575
WHEN YOUR BACK IS TURNED.

1:07:58.608 --> 1:08:01.611
- THIS IS A COURTESY,
AND IT'S OFF THE RECORD.

1:08:03.747 --> 1:08:05.515
- WHERE'S BARRY?

1:08:05.549 --> 1:08:07.884
GET THAT SCHWARTZE DOWN HERE
TO MOP UP THIS MESS.

1:08:07.917 --> 1:08:09.653
BARRY'S WITH ME TEN YEARS.

1:08:09.686 --> 1:08:11.355
THAT BUFTE'S NEVER TOUCHED
A GIRL.

1:08:11.388 --> 1:08:13.390
TALK ABOUT AN AFRICAN QUEEN.

1:08:13.423 --> 1:08:14.691
HERE'S THE BEAUTY PART.

1:08:14.724 --> 1:08:16.860
MY SIGNATURE'S
NOT ON ANYTHING.

1:08:16.893 --> 1:08:17.894
IT'S ALL BARRY.

1:08:17.927 --> 1:08:20.197
I HAD ANOTHER LAWYER
SET IT UP.

1:08:20.230 --> 1:08:23.267
LET BARRY THINK
HE'S THE H.N.I.C.

1:08:27.404 --> 1:08:31.841
- AH, THE CASUAL RACISM
OF THE SWEATY UNDERCLASS.

1:08:31.875 --> 1:08:34.411
- THERE'S HOURS OF THIS.

1:08:34.444 --> 1:08:36.746
- I GET THE GIST, DETECTIVE.

1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:38.848
- DO YOU?

1:08:38.882 --> 1:08:41.851
WE BOTH KNOW AS LONG AS YOU
STILL REPRESENT GANZEL,

1:08:41.885 --> 1:08:44.888
WE CAN'T HELP EACH OTHER.

1:08:49.859 --> 1:08:52.862
- NO OFFENSE.
- NONE TAKEN.

1:08:55.232 --> 1:08:57.234
- GO. SCRAM.
MAKE YOURSELF SCARCE.

1:08:57.267 --> 1:08:59.936
GET OUT OF HERE.
CHOP-CHOP!

1:08:59.969 --> 1:09:02.872
I'LL NEVER FIND ANYBODY
AS GOOD AS CASSIDY.

1:09:02.906 --> 1:09:05.609
THIS FRIGGIN' THING.

1:09:05.642 --> 1:09:08.578
- BART.
- WHAT?

1:09:08.612 --> 1:09:11.215
- I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
I CAN NO LONGER REPRESENT YOU.

1:09:11.248 --> 1:09:14.284
- [chuckles]
WHAT?

1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:19.223
YOU'RE SERIOUS?
YOU'RE NOT MY LAWYER.

1:09:19.256 --> 1:09:21.658
- THAT'S CORRECT.
- THAT'S JUST GREAT.

1:09:21.691 --> 1:09:24.228
NOW THAT THEY'RE COMING
AFTER ME--SINKING SHIP, BARRY.

1:09:24.261 --> 1:09:25.362
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

1:09:25.395 --> 1:09:26.596
- YOU HIRE ANOTHER ATTORNEY.

1:09:26.630 --> 1:09:28.398
- YEAH, I'LL GET
RIGHT ON THAT.

1:09:28.432 --> 1:09:30.200
IN THE MEANTIME,
I JUST NEED YOU TO TELL ME

1:09:30.234 --> 1:09:31.235
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

1:09:31.268 --> 1:09:32.836
- I'M NOT--

1:09:32.869 --> 1:09:34.938
- WHAT, YOU BITCHING
ABOUT GIVING ME A FREEBIE?

1:09:44.481 --> 1:09:45.915
I GOT A PROBLEM HERE.

1:09:45.949 --> 1:09:50.287
- I'D ADVISE:
RETAIN ANOTHER ATTORNEY.

1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:52.522
THEY HAVE A CASE
FOR PROMOTING PROSTITUTION,

1:09:52.556 --> 1:09:54.991
FOR ARRANGING A HIT
OF A POLICE OFFICER--

1:09:55.024 --> 1:09:56.326
- CASSIDY DIDN'T DIE.

1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:57.827
- LUCKY FOR YOU,

1:09:57.861 --> 1:09:59.329
OR YOU'D BE LOOKING
AT A MURDER CHARGE.

1:09:59.363 --> 1:10:03.333
- I STILL AM.

1:10:03.367 --> 1:10:06.336
LET ME ASK YOU...

1:10:06.370 --> 1:10:08.272
UM...

1:10:08.305 --> 1:10:12.276
IS PILLOW TALK ADMISSIBLE
OR HEARSAY?

1:10:12.309 --> 1:10:13.977
I HAVE TO SPELL THIS OUT
FOR YOU?

1:10:14.010 --> 1:10:17.013
CARISSA, SHE AND CASSIDY
WERE SLEEPING TOGETHER.

1:10:17.046 --> 1:10:18.348
SHE MUST'VE TOLD HIM
EVERYTHING.

1:10:18.382 --> 1:10:19.883
I GOT TO FINISH THE JOB
ON HIM.

1:10:19.916 --> 1:10:23.353
- HOLD UP.
BY EVERYTHING, YOU MEAN--

1:10:23.387 --> 1:10:26.523
- I SENT HER TO CRAGEN.
SIMPLE FRAME JOB.

1:10:26.556 --> 1:10:28.425
SHE'D DRUG HIM,
GET HIM IN BED.

1:10:28.458 --> 1:10:30.460
I'D COME IN,
SNAP SOME PHOTOS.

1:10:30.494 --> 1:10:33.930
- BART, WHAT DID YOU DO?

1:10:33.963 --> 1:10:36.032
- I KILLED HER.

1:10:36.065 --> 1:10:37.467
- WHAT?

1:10:37.501 --> 1:10:39.403
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

1:10:39.436 --> 1:10:41.971
IT WAS GOING GREAT.
SHE WAS A CHAMP.

1:10:42.005 --> 1:10:43.407
SHE GOT NAKED,
SCRATCHED HIS BACK,

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:44.474
POSED FOR THE PHOTOS.

1:10:44.508 --> 1:10:46.710
THEN SHE STARTS CRYING,

1:10:46.743 --> 1:10:48.945
SAYING HOW CASSIDY TOLD HER
IF I LOVED HER,

1:10:48.978 --> 1:10:50.880
I'D TREAT HER WITH RESPECT.

1:10:50.914 --> 1:10:51.948
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

1:10:51.981 --> 1:10:53.650
THE GUY'S ON MY PAYROLL.

1:10:53.683 --> 1:10:54.884
TURNS HE'S U.C.,

1:10:54.918 --> 1:10:57.020
AND HE'S SCREWING
MY FIANCEE.

1:10:57.053 --> 1:10:58.522
- BART, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

1:10:58.555 --> 1:11:00.657
- OH, YEAH, I DO.

1:11:00.690 --> 1:11:03.327
'CAUSE THEN SHE TELLS ME
SHE'S IN LOVE WITH CASSIDY,

1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:05.962
AND SHE'S GONNA LEAVE ME
FOR HIM.

1:11:05.995 --> 1:11:08.565
I GO CRAZY.

1:11:08.598 --> 1:11:12.569
I GO INTO THE KITCHEN,
GRAB A KNIFE.

1:11:12.602 --> 1:11:14.904
I KIND OF HAD A--

1:11:14.938 --> 1:11:16.373
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

1:11:16.406 --> 1:11:20.009
AN O.J. MOMENT?

1:11:20.043 --> 1:11:22.312
- SO THAT'S WHY
YOU SHOT CASSIDY.

1:11:22.346 --> 1:11:24.047
SO HE WOULDN'T TESTIFY.

1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:26.883
- YEAH, THAT.
HE PISSED ME OFF.

1:11:26.916 --> 1:11:29.319
- QUERNS TAPED THE WHOLE THING
ON HIS CELL PHONE.

1:11:29.353 --> 1:11:30.654
DID CASSIDY CONFIRM IT?

1:11:30.687 --> 1:11:32.489
- AND ADMITTED
THAT HE AND CARISSA

1:11:32.522 --> 1:11:35.058
HAVE BEEN HAVING AN AFFAIR
SINCE CHRISTMAS EVE.

1:11:35.091 --> 1:11:36.960
SWEARS SHE NEVER MENTIONED
ANYTHING

1:11:36.993 --> 1:11:38.995
ABOUT KILLING THE GOVERNOR
OR SETTING UP CRAGEN.

1:11:39.028 --> 1:11:41.064
- AND HE DIDN'T TELL ME
ABOUT THE AFFAIR.

1:11:41.097 --> 1:11:44.734
THAT SON OF A BITCH JEOPARDIZED
A THREE-YEAR INVESTIGATION.

1:11:44.768 --> 1:11:47.771
- WELL, LIKE YOU SAID,
EVERYONE HAS SECRETS.

1:11:51.975 --> 1:11:54.778
SO...

1:11:54.811 --> 1:11:56.012
WHEN DO I GET
TO TELL MY CAPTAIN

1:11:56.045 --> 1:11:58.948
HE'S OFF THE HOOK?

1:11:58.982 --> 1:12:00.950
- ABOUT THAT.

1:12:00.984 --> 1:12:04.020
UM...

1:12:04.053 --> 1:12:08.091
IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE
AS YOU'D THINK.

1:12:08.124 --> 1:12:11.060
[door lock buzzes]

1:12:11.094 --> 1:12:12.796
- THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, LIV.

1:12:12.829 --> 1:12:15.999
- OF COURSE.

1:12:16.032 --> 1:12:18.067
- WHAT IS IT?

1:12:18.101 --> 1:12:20.804
- DELIA WILSON CUT A DEAL
WITH THE D.A.

1:12:20.837 --> 1:12:23.473
SHE WALKS IN EXCHANGE
FOR HER COOPERATION.

1:12:23.507 --> 1:12:27.076
- AGAINST GANZEL?

1:12:27.110 --> 1:12:29.979
- AGAINST YOU.

1:12:30.013 --> 1:12:33.483
DELIA HAD THREE OF HER GIRLS
TESTIFY AT A GRAND JURY.

1:12:33.517 --> 1:12:36.453
FOSTER'S CHARGING YOU
WITH SOLICITATION,

1:12:36.486 --> 1:12:39.656
ASSAULT, FORCED SODOMY,

1:12:39.689 --> 1:12:42.726
AND USE OF A DEADLY WEAPON.

1:12:51.034 --> 1:12:52.636
- AFTER YESTERDAY'S ARREST

1:12:52.669 --> 1:12:54.404
OF SELF-PROCLAIMED "EMPEROR
OF PLEASURE" BART GANZEL

1:12:54.438 --> 1:12:55.972
FOR THE MURDER
OF ESCORT CARISSA GIBSON,

1:12:56.005 --> 1:12:59.008
THE NYPD REMAINS MIRED
IN THIS CORRUPTION SCANDAL,

1:12:59.042 --> 1:13:00.710
WITH NEW CHARGES BEING LEVELED

1:13:00.744 --> 1:13:03.513
AT BELEAGUERED SVU CAPTAIN
DONALD CRAGEN,

1:13:03.547 --> 1:13:06.716
INCLUDING SOLICITATION
AND SIX COUNTS OF FORCED SODOMY,

1:13:06.750 --> 1:13:08.418
USE OF A DEADLY WEAPON--

1:13:08.452 --> 1:13:10.554
- YOU WONDER WHY I BELIEVE
IN CONSPIRACIES?

1:13:10.587 --> 1:13:12.956
WELL, WE'RE LIVING IN ONE.

1:13:12.989 --> 1:13:14.591
- HOW'S CRAGEN?

1:13:14.624 --> 1:13:15.892
- HIS LAWYER WANTS HIM
TO PLEAD NO CONTEST

1:13:15.925 --> 1:13:17.193
TO THE SOLICITATION.

1:13:17.226 --> 1:13:18.662
THEY'LL LET HIM RESIGN.

1:13:18.695 --> 1:13:19.796
THEY'LL GIVE HIM HIS PENSION.

1:13:19.829 --> 1:13:21.698
- HE'S NOT TAKING THE DEAL.

1:13:21.731 --> 1:13:23.032
- HE'S THINKING ABOUT IT.

1:13:23.066 --> 1:13:24.768
- WELL, WE CAN'T LET THAT
HAPPEN.

1:13:24.801 --> 1:13:26.970
LOOK, DELIA'S JAMMING HIM UP.
WE GO AFTER DELIA.

1:13:27.003 --> 1:13:29.673
- WELL, GOOD LUCK. SHE'S TEFLON.
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

1:13:29.706 --> 1:13:31.975
TURNS OUT THERE'S BEEN THREE
UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATIONS

1:13:32.008 --> 1:13:34.043
INTO DELIA.

1:13:34.077 --> 1:13:36.480
- THE FIRST ONE, TWO MONTHS IN,
THE U.C. RESIGNS,

1:13:36.513 --> 1:13:38.482
MOVES DOWN TO ANGUILLA.

1:13:38.515 --> 1:13:40.183
- THE SECOND ONE,
THE UNDERCOVER GOT CAUGHT

1:13:40.216 --> 1:13:41.618
SLEEPING WITH THREE
OF HER ESCORTS.

1:13:41.651 --> 1:13:43.019
- THE LAST ONE,
FIVE YEARS AGO,

1:13:43.052 --> 1:13:45.021
WE TALKED TO THAT U.C.

1:13:45.054 --> 1:13:46.756
18 MONTHS OF WIRETAPS,

1:13:46.790 --> 1:13:48.458
AND THE A.G.
CRAP-CANNED THE CASE.

1:13:48.492 --> 1:13:51.127
SAID THE EVIDENCE
WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO WIN.

1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:52.228
- THREE UPS, YOU'RE OUT.

1:13:52.261 --> 1:13:56.966
- WAIT, HOLD UP--AND NO ONE'S
TOUCHED DELIA SINCE?

1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.537
- [scoffs]

1:14:02.806 --> 1:14:04.474
- YEAH, I KNOW ALL THREE
OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS.

1:14:04.508 --> 1:14:06.175
DELIA GOT
TO THE FIRST TWO U.C.s,

1:14:06.209 --> 1:14:07.677
TURNED THEM.

1:14:07.711 --> 1:14:09.846
- YEAH, AND THE THIRD,
18 MONTHS OF WIRETAPS,

1:14:09.879 --> 1:14:11.848
A SQUEAKY-CLEAN U.C.,

1:14:11.881 --> 1:14:14.618
AND THE A.G. DECLINES
TO PROSECUTE?

1:14:14.651 --> 1:14:16.953
- THE A.G. DIDN'T HAVE
THE APPETITE

1:14:16.986 --> 1:14:18.622
FOR A FIGHT
HE COULDN'T WIN.

1:14:18.655 --> 1:14:20.957
- DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON
TO BELIEVE

1:14:20.990 --> 1:14:23.059
THAT DELIA GOT
TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL?

1:14:23.092 --> 1:14:24.761
- NO, I DON'T.

1:14:24.794 --> 1:14:26.796
- WELL, WE KNOW
THAT SHE OWNS SOMEONE.

1:14:26.830 --> 1:14:28.732
LET'S AT LEAST LOOK INTO IT.

1:14:28.765 --> 1:14:30.600
- [sighs]

1:14:30.634 --> 1:14:33.069
LOOK INTO WHAT?

1:14:33.102 --> 1:14:35.639
OLIVIA...

1:14:35.672 --> 1:14:37.741
YOU CAN'T WIN THEM ALL.

1:14:37.774 --> 1:14:40.777
WE TOOK DOWN A MAJOR PLAYER
IN SEX TRAFFICKING.

1:14:40.810 --> 1:14:42.879
AND I MADE SURE
THAT YOUR CAPTAIN CAN RETIRE

1:14:42.912 --> 1:14:44.147
WITH FULL BENEFITS.

1:14:44.180 --> 1:14:46.516
- AND A DESTROYED REPUTATION.

1:14:46.550 --> 1:14:48.518
- HE DID HIRE THOSE WOMEN.

1:14:48.552 --> 1:14:50.286
- HE DIDN'T HAVE SEX
WITH THEM.

1:14:50.319 --> 1:14:51.921
YOU'RE TAKING THE WORD
OF PROSTITUTES

1:14:51.955 --> 1:14:54.591
OVER A 30-YEAR,
RESPECTED COP.

1:14:54.624 --> 1:14:56.960
- WITH HIS SHARE OF DEMONS.

1:14:56.993 --> 1:15:01.097
I CAN'T HAVE AN SVU CAPTAIN
PAYING FOR ESCORTS.

1:15:01.130 --> 1:15:02.766
- SO DELIA GETS AWAY
WITH MURDER?

1:15:02.799 --> 1:15:06.670
MAGGIE MURPHY? ANYA SOLAR?
IRIS PETERSON?

1:15:06.703 --> 1:15:08.672
- WE DON'T HAVE A SHRED
OF EVIDENCE

1:15:08.705 --> 1:15:10.306
THAT TIES DELIA
TO THOSE CRIMES.

1:15:10.339 --> 1:15:12.842
WE CAN'T EVEN PROVE
THEY WERE CRIMES.

1:15:12.876 --> 1:15:14.744
MAGGIE COULD HAVE BEEN
AN OVERDOSE.

1:15:14.778 --> 1:15:17.180
IRIS, A SUICIDE.
ANYA, A CAR ACCIDENT.

1:15:17.213 --> 1:15:19.583
- SO GO AFTER THEM
FOR PROSTITUTION.

1:15:19.616 --> 1:15:21.317
GO AFTER HER
LIKE YOU DID GANZEL.

1:15:21.350 --> 1:15:23.152
- THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

1:15:23.186 --> 1:15:24.854
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1:15:24.888 --> 1:15:28.191
- [sighs]

1:15:28.224 --> 1:15:30.860
I DROPPED THOSE CHARGES.

1:15:30.894 --> 1:15:35.231
I GRANTED HER IMMUNITY
ON THEM.

1:15:35.264 --> 1:15:39.068
CONFIDENTIALLY, DELIA IS GOING
TO BE COOPERATING

1:15:39.102 --> 1:15:42.105
WITH OUR OFFICE
ON FUTURE CASES.

1:15:44.774 --> 1:15:48.177
- SHE'S TURNING OVER
HER CLIENT LIST?

1:15:48.211 --> 1:15:51.214
- WE'RE TALKING TO HER.

1:15:55.384 --> 1:15:58.588
- OKAY, THEN.

1:16:00.790 --> 1:16:03.727
- I KNOW I'VE DISAPPOINTED YOU.

1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:08.231
AND I DO FEEL SORRY
FOR YOUR CAPTAIN.

1:16:08.264 --> 1:16:11.835
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, OLIVIA,
I TRIED.

1:16:13.637 --> 1:16:15.705
[knock at door]

1:16:15.739 --> 1:16:16.840
I SAID NO INTERRUPTIONS.

1:16:16.873 --> 1:16:19.308
- IT'S YOUR DAUGHTER.
SHE FELL.

1:16:42.699 --> 1:16:44.000
- COVERTLY INVESTIGATING

1:16:44.033 --> 1:16:46.369
THE HEAD OF THE PUBLIC INTEGRITY
UNIT'S FINANCES.

1:16:46.402 --> 1:16:48.104
THERE'S SOME IRONY THERE.

1:16:48.137 --> 1:16:49.939
- I'M HALF HOPING I'M WRONG.

1:16:49.973 --> 1:16:51.775
- SORRY, LIV.
- OKAY, FOSTER'S SALARY,

1:16:51.808 --> 1:16:53.777
AND THEN THERE'S THE COST
OF HER DAUGHTER'S TREATMENT.

1:16:53.810 --> 1:16:54.811
I MEAN, ASIDE
FROM THE HOME CARE,

1:16:54.844 --> 1:16:56.680
SHE GETS PHYSICAL THERAPY,

1:16:56.713 --> 1:16:58.748
EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS,
AND EVEN AFTER THE INSURANCE,

1:16:58.782 --> 1:17:00.750
I FOUND A $200,000-A-YEAR GAP.

1:17:00.784 --> 1:17:03.920
- OKAY, SO HOW DOES FOSTER MAKE
HER PAYMENTS?

1:17:03.953 --> 1:17:05.722
- NOT BY CHECK OR CREDIT CARD.

1:17:05.755 --> 1:17:07.957
I CHECKED THE FINANCIALS
OF THE THERAPIST,

1:17:07.991 --> 1:17:09.192
THE IN-HOME NURSE.

1:17:09.225 --> 1:17:11.728
EACH MAKES
MONTHLY CASH DEPOSITS

1:17:11.761 --> 1:17:13.663
BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN GRAND.

1:17:13.697 --> 1:17:16.432
- OKAY, DOES FOSTER HAVE
FAMILY MONEY? LOANS?

1:17:16.465 --> 1:17:18.334
DOES HER DAUGHTER'S FATHER
KICK IN?

1:17:18.367 --> 1:17:20.937
- FATHER LEFT
WHEN SARAH WAS DIAGNOSED.

1:17:20.970 --> 1:17:23.172
- ONE MORE THING, LIV.

1:17:23.206 --> 1:17:25.308
FOSTER HAS A TRUST SET UP
FOR HER DAUGHTER.

1:17:25.341 --> 1:17:26.810
FIVE YEARS AGO,
SHE TRANSFERRED IT

1:17:26.843 --> 1:17:28.444
TO AN OFFSHORE ACCOUNT...

1:17:28.477 --> 1:17:30.747
IN ANGUILLA.

1:17:34.217 --> 1:17:37.854
- [sighs]

1:17:37.887 --> 1:17:39.689
- OLIVIA.

1:17:39.723 --> 1:17:40.724
- SARAH'S OKAY.

1:17:40.757 --> 1:17:43.192
- YEAH, WE GOT LUCKY.

1:17:43.226 --> 1:17:44.427
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1:17:44.460 --> 1:17:46.763
- I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU...

1:17:46.796 --> 1:17:47.897
ABOUT DELIA.

1:17:47.931 --> 1:17:50.734
- [groans]
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

1:17:50.767 --> 1:17:52.401
IT'S DONE. LET IT GO.

1:17:52.435 --> 1:17:55.438
- YEAH, BUT THE THING IS,
I...CAN'T.

1:18:01.277 --> 1:18:05.214
THE CARE FOR SARAH, THAT, UH--
THAT CAN'T BE CHEAP.

1:18:05.248 --> 1:18:06.783
- INSURANCE COVERS MOST OF IT.

1:18:06.816 --> 1:18:08.718
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

1:18:08.752 --> 1:18:12.421
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

1:18:12.455 --> 1:18:13.957
- HOW IS THAT YOUR BUSINESS?

1:18:13.990 --> 1:18:17.794
- THE THREE-YEAR INVESTIGATION
INTO GANZEL,

1:18:17.827 --> 1:18:21.397
FRAMING MY CAPTAIN...

1:18:21.430 --> 1:18:24.768
IT'S ALL ABOUT
PROTECTING DELIA.

1:18:24.801 --> 1:18:26.269
- WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

1:18:26.302 --> 1:18:29.739
- ANGUILLA. WHERE EXLEY HID
THE TRUST FUND

1:18:29.773 --> 1:18:32.341
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

1:18:32.375 --> 1:18:36.112
THE CASH PAYMENTS
FOR HER PHYSICAL THERAPY.

1:18:36.145 --> 1:18:39.148
- YOU LOOKED INTO MY FINANCES.
- WE SURE DID.

1:18:48.825 --> 1:18:51.828
HERE WE ARE, PAULA.

1:18:53.863 --> 1:18:57.100
YOU'RE FINISHED.

1:18:57.133 --> 1:18:59.102
HOW LONG?

1:18:59.135 --> 1:19:02.371
- EIGHT YEARS.

1:19:02.405 --> 1:19:04.173
SARAH WAS ONE.

1:19:04.207 --> 1:19:08.945
SHE NEEDED SURGERY.
MY HUSBAND WAS GONE.

1:19:08.978 --> 1:19:11.347
EXLEY APPROACHED ME,
AND HE OFFERED TO HELP.

1:19:11.380 --> 1:19:12.916
HE WAS ON THE BOARD
OF A CHARITY.

1:19:12.949 --> 1:19:15.218
HE GAVE ME A CHECK.

1:19:15.251 --> 1:19:16.820
AND THEN HE GAVE ME
ANOTHER ONE.

1:19:16.853 --> 1:19:18.554
HE DIDN'T TELL ME
UNTIL LATER

1:19:18.587 --> 1:19:21.224
THAT THEY COULD BE TRACED
TO DELIA.

1:19:21.257 --> 1:19:24.293
AND IN THE BEGINNING,
HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK ANY FAVORS.

1:19:24.327 --> 1:19:26.295
I WAS BEING PAID
TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY

1:19:26.329 --> 1:19:28.431
ON THINGS
I WASN'T LOOKING AT ANYWAY.

1:19:28.464 --> 1:19:29.933
- AND THEN IT CHANGED.

1:19:29.966 --> 1:19:31.935
- SLOWLY.

1:19:31.968 --> 1:19:35.504
"WILL YOU RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK
OR D.M.V. INFORMATION?"

1:19:35.538 --> 1:19:36.873
"PUT IN A GOOD WORD

1:19:36.906 --> 1:19:39.442
ON A WORKING GIRL'S
PLEA BARGAIN."

1:19:39.475 --> 1:19:40.910
AND THEN, ONCE THEY KNEW
THEY HAD ME,

1:19:40.944 --> 1:19:42.979
THE ASKS GOT BIGGER.

1:19:43.012 --> 1:19:45.014
DELIA SAW GANZEL
AS A THREAT,

1:19:45.048 --> 1:19:48.151
ASKED ME TO KEEP TABS.

1:19:48.184 --> 1:19:49.819
AND EVEN THEN,
I JUST THOUGHT

1:19:49.853 --> 1:19:53.022
SHE WAS A BUSINESSWOMAN
PROTECTING HER TURF.

1:19:53.056 --> 1:19:55.091
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT A MONSTER SHE WAS.

1:19:55.124 --> 1:20:00.463
- UNTIL MAGGIE,
UNTIL ANYA AND IRIS.

1:20:00.496 --> 1:20:03.967
YOU PROTECTED A MURDERER.
YOU LET HER WALK.

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:05.501
YOU FRAMED MY CAPTAIN.

1:20:05.534 --> 1:20:07.503
- OKAY, BY THEN,
SHE OWNED ME.

1:20:07.536 --> 1:20:09.605
- SHE PAID FOR YOU.
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

1:20:09.638 --> 1:20:11.841
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1:20:11.875 --> 1:20:13.109
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT'S LIKE

1:20:13.142 --> 1:20:16.145
TO HAVE A CHILD
COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON YOU.

1:20:16.179 --> 1:20:18.481
AGONIZING ABOUT HER
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

1:20:18.514 --> 1:20:20.416
TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO HER

1:20:20.449 --> 1:20:22.986
WHEN YOU'RE GONE.

1:20:23.019 --> 1:20:25.955
YOU CAN'T EVER
UNDERSTAND THAT.

1:20:25.989 --> 1:20:28.992
YOU'RE NOT A MOTHER.

1:20:36.299 --> 1:20:37.566
- I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:39.502
- ARE YOU?

1:20:39.535 --> 1:20:44.273
BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE ME DOWN,
SARAH'S GOT NO ONE.

1:20:44.307 --> 1:20:47.543
DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

1:20:47.576 --> 1:20:50.113
LOOK AT HER.

1:20:50.146 --> 1:20:53.649
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GONNA HAPPEN TO HER?

1:20:53.682 --> 1:20:56.452
- COME ON, PAULA.
WE'RE GONNA GO ON A WALK.

1:20:56.485 --> 1:20:58.621
- WHY?

1:20:58.654 --> 1:21:01.390
- BECAUSE I HAVE TO ARREST YOU.

1:21:01.424 --> 1:21:04.427
AND I DON'T WANT YOUR DAUGHTER
TO SEE THAT.

1:21:25.681 --> 1:21:27.583
- AFTER THE ARREST OF UPPER
EAST SIDE MADAM DELIA WILSON

1:21:27.616 --> 1:21:29.518
ON RACKETEERING
AND MURDER CHARGES,

1:21:29.552 --> 1:21:31.921
THE CITY WAS STUNNED TODAY
BY THE ARREST

1:21:31.955 --> 1:21:34.924
OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

1:21:34.958 --> 1:21:37.493
CHARGES INCLUDED PROMOTING
PROSTITUTION, SOLICITATION,

1:21:37.526 --> 1:21:39.328
AND ACCEPTING BRIBES.

1:21:39.362 --> 1:21:42.498
ARRESTED WITH HIM WAS
A WHO'S WHO OF CITY POLITICS:

1:21:42.531 --> 1:21:44.267
THREE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS,

1:21:44.300 --> 1:21:46.335
THE HEAD OF THE D.A.'S
PUBLIC INTEGRITY UNIT,

1:21:46.369 --> 1:21:49.172
SEVEN MEMBERS
OF NYPD'S VICE SQUAD,

1:21:49.205 --> 1:21:53.442
TWO STATE SENATORS,
AND TWO DEPUTY MAYORS.

1:21:53.476 --> 1:21:55.544
- DELIA'S GIRLS ALL MADE
A FULL CONFESSION,

1:21:55.578 --> 1:21:57.613
RECANTED THEIR ACCUSATIONS.

1:21:57.646 --> 1:22:00.183
I GOT A HANDSHAKE
FROM THIS WEEK'S D.A.

1:22:00.216 --> 1:22:01.617
- TOLD YOU TO STAY POSITIVE,
HUH?

1:22:01.650 --> 1:22:03.619
WHEN WILL YOU BE
BACK AT WORK?

1:22:03.652 --> 1:22:05.254
- WELL, A LOT OF HOOPS.
NOT RIGHT AWAY.

1:22:05.288 --> 1:22:08.257
AND THEN WHEN I DO--
I BEAT THE CHARGES,

1:22:08.291 --> 1:22:11.260
BUT THE WHISPERS WON'T STOP.

1:22:11.294 --> 1:22:12.495
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT
THROUGH IT.

1:22:12.528 --> 1:22:14.430
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

1:22:14.463 --> 1:22:16.632
- YEAH...ONE DAY AT A TIME.

1:22:16.665 --> 1:22:18.001
- WELL, JUST HURRY BACK,
CAPTAIN.

1:22:18.034 --> 1:22:19.302
HARRIS WON'T STOP
BUSTING MY CHOPS

1:22:19.335 --> 1:22:20.669
ABOUT HOW I DRESS.

1:22:20.703 --> 1:22:23.706
- HE'S RIGHT.

1:22:31.047 --> 1:22:34.050
- I HEARD DAVID HADEN TURNED IN
HIS RESIGNATION.

1:22:37.220 --> 1:22:39.522
- HE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH ALL OF THIS.

1:22:39.555 --> 1:22:42.258
- WELL, EVEN SO,
FOSTER REPORTED TO HIM.

1:22:42.291 --> 1:22:43.626
HE SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

1:22:43.659 --> 1:22:47.430
- [sighs]

1:22:47.463 --> 1:22:49.498
- I'M SORRY.

1:22:49.532 --> 1:22:54.570
- NICK, I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE STILL ANGRY.

1:22:54.603 --> 1:22:57.606
WE SHOULD TALK.

1:23:01.744 --> 1:23:05.448
- OKAY. WE'LL DO THAT.

1:23:08.517 --> 1:23:10.319
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

1:23:10.353 --> 1:23:13.356
- YEAH.

1:23:15.558 --> 1:23:19.195
- YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT FOSTER'S DAUGHTER.

1:23:19.228 --> 1:23:23.399
YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

1:23:23.432 --> 1:23:24.800
- I KNOW.

1:23:24.833 --> 1:23:27.603
- GO HOME, DETECTIVE.

1:23:27.636 --> 1:23:29.538
- I WILL.
