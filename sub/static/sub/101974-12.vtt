<i> MARTIN (echoes):</i>
<i> This is about family.</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:17.558
Martin? He was never with us.

<i> It's all for you.</i>

<i> For us.</i>

00:41.542 --> 00:43.459
(breathing heavily)

00:47.289 --> 00:48.672
Bright?

00:55.038 --> 00:57.014
I heard what happened
at the farm.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.059
The Surgeon's gone.

01:01.711 --> 01:04.546
(sighs) So all eyes are on
his head case son, right?

01:05.457 --> 01:09.293
The criminal profiler who
couldn't find his own father.

01:09.311 --> 01:11.236
No one cares about that.

01:11.463 --> 01:12.279
I care.

01:14.149 --> 01:17.034
I can't live like this.

01:18.895 --> 01:21.121
Knowing he's out there
somewhere.

01:22.975 --> 01:25.417
He could come
for me at any time.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.130
That's not what scares you.

01:33.168 --> 01:34.909
What scares you

01:34.929 --> 01:37.429
is living the rest of your life
without your father in it.

01:37.581 --> 01:40.766
No, my mistake was
underestimating him.

01:40.917 --> 01:42.159
It was brilliant, really,

01:42.252 --> 01:44.661
using the other inmates
as a diversion.

01:44.680 --> 01:48.440
-Bright.
-But to craft
an alternate escape plan?

01:48.592 --> 01:52.853
Martin must have had
another ally.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.522
-Someone I missed.
-Give it a rest.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.190
For once in your life,
slow down and acknowledge

01:57.343 --> 01:59.076
what this is doing to you.

02:17.787 --> 02:19.596
Where's Vivian Capshaw?

02:22.201 --> 02:24.226
-(engine starts)
-(siren wailing)

02:29.224 --> 02:32.359
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:46.816 --> 02:48.333
License and registration,
please.

02:48.485 --> 02:50.169
Sure. Um...

02:50.396 --> 02:53.755
Sorry, did I do something wrong?

02:57.494 --> 02:59.011
All right.

02:59.162 --> 03:02.181
Ms. Capshaw.

03:02.332 --> 03:03.765
Vivian.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.672
Can I get a peek in your trunk?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.357
Huh?

03:14.361 --> 03:15.936
(laughs):
No, I'm messing with you.

03:16.088 --> 03:17.921
-Oh.
-Your left taillight's out.

03:17.940 --> 03:19.847
I'd be happy to take
a look back there,

03:19.942 --> 03:21.775
tell you if it's the bulb
or the fuse.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.035
That's a kind offer.

03:23.262 --> 03:25.262
Oh, it's just a little common
courtesy

03:25.355 --> 03:30.292
for a, uh, a nice lady
driving alone at night.

03:32.788 --> 03:34.271
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

03:34.289 --> 03:36.715
Ooh, I've heard that one before.

03:36.866 --> 03:39.793
You know, in my defense,

03:39.945 --> 03:41.553
they don't make 'em
prettier than you.

03:41.705 --> 03:43.705
Wow.

03:43.799 --> 03:46.058
Pretty and nice?

03:47.636 --> 03:53.548
We're so lucky to have
a strong, confident man like you

03:53.642 --> 03:55.308
protecting us from...

03:55.402 --> 03:59.696
the unsavory elements
of society.

04:02.801 --> 04:03.967
Can I go now?

04:04.060 --> 04:05.986
You headed for the beach?

04:06.138 --> 04:07.746
A little sun and fun?

04:07.897 --> 04:09.748
That's the plan.

04:10.809 --> 04:11.975
Yeah. You can go.

04:11.994 --> 04:13.660
(clears throat)

04:13.812 --> 04:15.254
Drive safe now.

04:26.158 --> 04:27.266

04:29.161 --> 04:30.686
(car door closes)

04:31.680 --> 04:33.689
♪ ♪

04:36.685 --> 04:37.609
They were having sex.

04:37.836 --> 04:39.169
My father
and-and Vivian Capshaw.

04:39.262 --> 04:40.670
The woman made a mistake.

04:40.689 --> 04:43.840
Doesn't mean she was boffing
a convicted serial killer.

04:43.859 --> 04:46.809
During my last visit,
my father was preoccupied

04:46.811 --> 04:48.178
with some sort
of erotic fantasy.

04:48.196 --> 04:49.513
Uh, that's TMI, bro.

04:49.531 --> 04:53.107
But what if it wasn't
just a fantasy?

04:53.201 --> 04:55.610
There were candy wrappers.
Butterscotch.

04:55.704 --> 04:57.187
Martin had them tucked away,

04:57.205 --> 05:00.632
like little mementos, indicating
some sort of significance.

05:00.859 --> 05:03.242
If I'm right, at the very least,

05:03.395 --> 05:05.211
Vivian is lying
about the severity

05:05.364 --> 05:06.621
of her lapse in judgment.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.623
At worst,

05:08.717 --> 05:11.051
she's the one who broke
my father out of Claremont.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.311
(scoffs)
Okay.

05:12.538 --> 05:14.888
Call me if you turn up
with an actual lead.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.631
And as for you,

05:16.650 --> 05:17.390
you're off my case.

05:17.543 --> 05:18.875
You said yourself

05:18.968 --> 05:22.062
I'm in a unique position
to help you find Martin Whitly.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.155
That was before
I spent yesterday

05:23.306 --> 05:25.282
barking up the wrong tree.

05:29.571 --> 05:32.164
This doesn't mean we can't run
a parallel investigation.

05:32.315 --> 05:33.907
-(table thuds)
-That's exactly what it means.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.409
Gil, please.
You know how much I need this.

05:36.562 --> 05:37.502
DANI:
Stop.

05:37.654 --> 05:39.245
I am scared.

05:39.398 --> 05:41.231
You barely made it through
the last manhunt.

05:41.249 --> 05:42.749
You are not gonna
survive another one.

05:42.901 --> 05:43.917
Go home, Malcolm.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.919
I'm not ordering you this time,

05:46.071 --> 05:48.180
I'm begging you.

05:56.172 --> 05:58.264
<i> AINSLEY: The Surgeon has been</i>
<i> missing for days,</i>

05:58.417 --> 06:00.934
and Gil wants to take you
off the case?

06:01.028 --> 06:02.268
He thinks I'm a liability.

06:02.421 --> 06:05.271
Don't they even want
to bring Dad in?

06:05.424 --> 06:08.441
Dead or alive.
Case closes either way.

06:08.594 --> 06:09.593
Good.

06:09.686 --> 06:11.036
AINSLEY:
Maybe keep a lid

06:11.263 --> 06:13.205
on the death wish just
for the sake of your children?

06:13.356 --> 06:15.098
I support Gil's decision.

06:15.117 --> 06:17.617
That does not mean
I want your father dead.

06:18.695 --> 06:22.714
(sighs) You have become
consumed by this, Malcolm.

06:22.866 --> 06:24.716
You cannot keep tormenting
yourself

06:24.868 --> 06:28.595
in some desperate attempt
to understand his twisted mind.

06:33.042 --> 06:34.893
I love you.

06:35.044 --> 06:37.879
Both of you.

06:37.973 --> 06:39.731
More than I hate him.

06:39.883 --> 06:41.566
Now, it is time

06:41.718 --> 06:43.977
that we pour ourselves a drink,
hunker down,

06:44.129 --> 06:46.363
and let the police
do their work.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.816
What are your theories, exactly?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.118
(groans)

06:51.912 --> 06:53.078
Vivian Capshaw.

06:53.229 --> 06:55.972
She didn't just
unshackle Martin.

06:55.991 --> 06:57.082
She helped him escape.

06:57.233 --> 06:59.476
Well, if he's gotten
into her mind,

06:59.494 --> 07:02.403
then she's a victim,
no matter how complicit.

07:02.423 --> 07:03.813
They have to understand that.

07:03.832 --> 07:04.906
She's also missing.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.758
So Dad and this woman are just

07:06.910 --> 07:08.668
out there somewhere, together?

07:08.820 --> 07:10.987
That's the theory.
But they don't believe it.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.322
So no one's looking for her.

07:12.340 --> 07:15.416
Look, I know you don't care
about Martin.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.843
But what about
a brainwashed woman

07:16.995 --> 07:18.311
trapped in the clutches

07:18.421 --> 07:19.846
of an unleashed serial killer?

07:19.998 --> 07:24.184
Vivian Capshaw
isn't just a victim.

07:24.336 --> 07:26.361
She could be victim number 24.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.739
Well, then, we have to find her.

07:38.900 --> 07:40.942
("Adagio" from Rachmaninoff's
<i> Symphony No. 2</i> playing)

07:41.036 --> 07:43.253
(humming)

07:59.554 --> 08:03.982
I hoped that we'd have
all this someday, didn't you?

08:06.211 --> 08:08.236
Rachmaninoff.

08:10.065 --> 08:11.898
Hmm. Cold drink.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.825
The water view.

08:13.977 --> 08:16.369
Because of you...

08:18.165 --> 08:23.168
...wow, today is someday.

08:23.319 --> 08:26.654
No, no, no, darling,
don't try and get up.

08:26.748 --> 08:29.341
We wouldn't want you
to hurt yourself, would we?

08:29.492 --> 08:31.843
I can't...

08:31.995 --> 08:33.345
I can't feel my legs.

08:33.496 --> 08:35.347
I know you can't.

08:35.498 --> 08:37.832
You were trapped in the trunk
of my car for hours.

08:37.926 --> 08:42.412
Oh, and when we finally
arrived here,

08:42.430 --> 08:44.264
I took the liberty
of administering

08:44.416 --> 08:46.674
a lidocaine spinal block
as well.

08:46.768 --> 08:48.601
Wha... What did you...?

08:48.754 --> 08:52.272
CAPSHAW:
It was for your own good,
sweetheart.

08:52.424 --> 08:53.940
I was worried-- very worried--

08:54.034 --> 08:56.034
that the abrupt change
of scenery

08:56.185 --> 08:57.427
could be jarring.

08:57.445 --> 08:59.329
So...

09:00.265 --> 09:02.374
...what do you remember?

09:02.525 --> 09:03.583
<i> (alarm sounding)</i>

09:05.879 --> 09:09.714

09:09.866 --> 09:12.942
<i> You probably didn't even feel</i>

09:13.003 --> 09:15.036

-Ah...

09:15.055 --> 09:16.555

-(thuds)
<i> -CAPSHAW: It was</i>

09:23.455 --> 09:26.314
Finally, we can be together.

09:30.796 --> 09:32.737
(music distorting)

09:34.800 --> 09:36.658
Welcome home.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.570
-(jazz playing faintly)
-(indistinct chatter)

09:49.590 --> 09:50.446
Ah.

09:51.483 --> 09:53.425
(whispering):
Is that Jessica Whitly?

09:53.576 --> 09:56.077
(gasps)
Raymond.

09:56.171 --> 09:57.987
Uh, may we join you?

09:58.006 --> 09:59.339
-(laughs)
-J-Jessica.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.582
I'm not sure that's appropriate.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.602
Aw, do they still have that--
thank you so much--

10:03.829 --> 10:07.439
chopped Thai ginger salad? Mmm.

10:07.590 --> 10:09.499
It's been 20 years.

10:09.517 --> 10:10.683
Oh, still,
there's nothing like the kick

10:10.777 --> 10:12.335
of a little spicy
peanut dressing

10:12.354 --> 10:14.696
to get you through
that post-lunch myectomy.

10:15.523 --> 10:16.281
(laughs)

10:16.432 --> 10:19.342
Dr. Stengel. It's me, Malcolm.

10:19.361 --> 10:21.620
Malcolm Whitly? You're-you're...

10:21.771 --> 10:23.196
All grown up, yes.

10:23.348 --> 10:25.106
You might have
recognized me better

10:25.125 --> 10:27.200
if you hadn't shunned us
after my father's arrest.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.443
JESSICA:
Oh, there, there, darling.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.871
Raymond was only sacrificing
his personal integrity

10:32.023 --> 10:34.023
in order to appease
the hospital donors.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.785
What are you doing here?
Have the police found Martin?

10:37.879 --> 10:39.863
(laughs):
No. No.

10:39.956 --> 10:41.714
And they won't.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.216
Not without your help.

10:43.368 --> 10:44.643
BRIGHT:
I have reason
to believe my father

10:44.794 --> 10:47.145
has taken a hostage, a
correctional medicine physician

10:47.296 --> 10:48.538
at Claremont Psychiatric.

10:48.556 --> 10:50.965
Look, I don't see
what that has to do with me.

10:51.059 --> 10:53.835
Learning about her is
how I catch him.

10:53.895 --> 10:56.880
Victimology is an important
subset of forensic psychology.

10:56.898 --> 10:59.491
-What is it you do for a living?
-It's an emerging profile.

10:59.642 --> 11:03.811
But to truly understand
Dr. Vivian Capshaw,

11:03.905 --> 11:04.904
I need more.

11:05.056 --> 11:06.831
And that's where you come in.

11:06.983 --> 11:10.243
Look, I don't have access
to those kinds of records.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.170
Oh, you have a crony
on the board

11:12.397 --> 11:14.063
of every hospital in this city.

11:14.082 --> 11:17.491
Now, we need to know
every secret there is to know

11:17.511 --> 11:20.261
about Vivian Capshaw.

11:23.499 --> 11:25.909
Did your father and I
ever tell you the story?

11:25.927 --> 11:27.185
How we met?

11:30.173 --> 11:33.692
Oh. It was a hospital benefit.

11:33.843 --> 11:35.919
Black tie.

11:35.937 --> 11:37.937
Of course,
the best Martin could muster was

11:38.031 --> 11:39.698
a navy suit and brown shoes.

11:39.849 --> 11:43.443
But somehow I managed
to see past the shoes

11:43.595 --> 11:45.778
when Raymond introduced us.

11:47.023 --> 11:50.542
I never properly thanked you
for that introduction, Raymond.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.269
(sighs)

11:53.362 --> 11:55.121
I will find out what I can.

11:55.273 --> 11:57.549
I need Capshaw's file.

11:57.700 --> 12:00.051
A list of all her patients,
their cases...

12:00.278 --> 12:03.346
Fine, I'll get it, all of it.
Just please leave.

12:05.116 --> 12:08.042
(car horns honking)

12:08.061 --> 12:09.543
According to Capshaw's file,

12:09.637 --> 12:12.731
Logan Zeiger was one of her last
patients at St. Sebastian's.

12:12.882 --> 12:14.548
So this guy's
the reason she resigned?

12:14.568 --> 12:18.144
We know Vivian likes to blur
the lines of authority.

12:18.296 --> 12:20.905
Maybe Martin wasn't
her first office romance.

12:21.057 --> 12:22.657
Gross.

12:24.652 --> 12:25.910
(buzzes)

12:26.062 --> 12:28.562
Mr. Zeiger is in meetings
all day.

12:28.656 --> 12:30.306
What's in that room?

12:30.399 --> 12:31.750
Who are you?

12:31.977 --> 12:34.335
-My assistant.
-Long-suffering.

12:35.830 --> 12:38.164
ASSISTANT:
I'm sorry,
I have to ask you to leave.

12:38.316 --> 12:41.408
Ms. Whitly would really like
to include Mr. Zeiger's comments

12:41.428 --> 12:44.745
on Dr. Vivian Capshaw
for her segment.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.015

12:54.182 --> 12:55.440

12:55.667 --> 12:57.016
-(groaning)
-ASSISTANT: He's paralyzed.

12:57.168 --> 12:59.694
A high-level cervical
spinal cord injury.

13:00.930 --> 13:02.197
Can he talk?

13:05.176 --> 13:08.011
(raspy voice):
Hell yes, I can talk.

13:08.029 --> 13:12.106
But the Dow doesn't look kindly
on invalids.

13:12.200 --> 13:16.869
The hospital considered
my condition inoperable.

13:17.022 --> 13:20.948
Must have seen 50 doctors
until Vivian...

13:20.967 --> 13:23.968
Vivian's surgery paralyzed you,
didn't it?

13:24.120 --> 13:26.212
Do you hold her responsible?

13:26.364 --> 13:30.124
Vivian helped me
when no one else would.

13:30.218 --> 13:31.476
-(monitor beeping rapidly)

13:31.703 --> 13:32.977

13:33.129 --> 13:35.647
No. Tell me, please, Logan.

13:35.798 --> 13:37.482
Tell me how she helped you.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.208

of my surgery.

13:48.144 --> 13:50.662
The day...

13:50.889 --> 13:53.498
I became a survivor.

Now...

13:56.895 --> 13:59.562

the escape of Martin Whitly

14:03.492 --> 14:05.234
from Claremont Psychiatric
Hospital.

14:05.328 --> 14:06.511
We have reason to believe

14:06.662 --> 14:09.739
that Dr. Capshaw acted
as his accomplice.

14:09.757 --> 14:13.409
Vivian is not some criminal.

14:13.428 --> 14:15.578
She's a hero.

14:36.117 --> 14:37.825
What are you thinking?

14:38.937 --> 14:41.787
I don't think Vivian is
the victim here.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.882
I think our father is.

some getting used to.

15:10.969 --> 15:12.652
But no one's looking for me.

15:12.804 --> 15:16.247
All police see when they
look at me is a victim.

forces her to resign,

the same respect?

25:37.203 --> 25:39.928
Dani, I respect you.

25:39.947 --> 25:41.705
Come over here.

25:41.857 --> 25:44.357
Fentanyl, other opiates.

25:44.377 --> 25:48.120
Paralytics, beta blockers,
sedatives.

25:48.272 --> 25:51.031
She's a doctor. It's not enough.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.199
When will it be enough?

25:53.219 --> 25:56.445
I need you. I'm not a cop.

25:56.463 --> 25:58.947
But I have been right before,
when everyone else is wrong,

25:58.966 --> 26:02.393
and I am telling you,
I am right on this.

26:03.804 --> 26:06.355
We are running
out of time to save him.

26:08.216 --> 26:09.549
You don't care.

26:09.569 --> 26:13.979
None of you care
if my father lives or dies.

26:14.131 --> 26:16.740
And what if he did?

26:16.967 --> 26:20.661
I'll tell you what,
you would be free.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.006
What if I need...?

26:32.833 --> 26:33.816
What if...

26:33.909 --> 26:37.336
What if he makes me who I am?

26:37.488 --> 26:42.007
Martin Whitly is
a cruel and violent man.

26:42.101 --> 26:46.294
You, you are none
of those things.

26:46.296 --> 26:50.015
Let him go, Malcolm.

26:50.167 --> 26:52.851
I'm begging you.

26:53.003 --> 26:55.070
You could have a life.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.084
(phone vibrating)

27:09.945 --> 27:11.854
Bright...

27:11.947 --> 27:13.538
Um...

27:13.633 --> 27:15.691
It's Gil. I...

27:15.784 --> 27:18.618
I'll be right back
and we can talk, okay?

27:18.638 --> 27:20.429
Hey, boss.

27:26.036 --> 27:27.311
(click)

27:46.648 --> 27:47.647

Who's there?

27:47.700 --> 27:48.707
Hey!

28:08.354 --> 28:10.521
(panting)

28:13.767 --> 28:16.527
(phone vibrating)

28:16.754 --> 28:18.086
Ainsley.

28:18.105 --> 28:19.363
Did you find anything?

28:21.200 --> 28:24.284
Malcolm? Malcolm, are you there?

28:31.026 --> 28:33.043
Hello, Malcolm.

28:34.880 --> 28:39.091
Just dropped by
to pick up a few things.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.594
I know you took my father.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.723
I know what you're doing to him.

28:46.951 --> 28:48.726
I'm not sure that's possible.

28:48.877 --> 28:50.602
Tell me where he is!

28:51.638 --> 28:53.472
You could arrest me.

28:53.566 --> 28:56.024
But then you wouldn't
find where he is.

29:03.058 --> 29:04.658
Take me to Martin Whitly.

29:05.727 --> 29:07.035
No.

29:14.569 --> 29:19.631
I'll surrender,
put my life in your hands...

29:21.243 --> 29:25.679
...if you bring me to my father.

29:28.416 --> 29:30.225
And then what?

29:31.771 --> 29:34.646
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

29:36.667 --> 29:39.443
Or maybe I'll call my friends
at Major Crimes.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.085
What is it?

29:58.464 --> 30:02.049
All you need to know is
that two would do the trick.

30:05.954 --> 30:07.262
(crunches)

30:14.313 --> 30:16.146
Gil wants us to head home.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.073
Bright?

30:29.553 --> 30:31.662
Lieutenant, why are you
at the Whitly home?

30:31.889 --> 30:33.980

30:34.074 --> 30:35.749
<i> MARTIN:</i>

30:37.319 --> 30:39.077
GIL:
The security is so tight
out there,

30:39.229 --> 30:41.463
-they almost didn't let me in.
-What are you doing here?

30:42.900 --> 30:45.342
I didn't know I needed an excuse
to check up on you.

30:45.493 --> 30:48.846
(exhales)
I'm so sorry.

30:49.073 --> 30:51.831
The, the press, the police,

30:51.925 --> 30:53.925
it just brings it all back,
doesn't it?

30:54.019 --> 30:57.596
Here I am,
trapped again in this house

30:57.748 --> 30:58.930
with all these ghosts,

30:59.024 --> 31:00.932
and it's all because of him.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.435
But how's the search going?

31:03.587 --> 31:07.322
Have the Marshals
found anything? Any leads?

31:08.759 --> 31:10.492
I know why you're anxious, Jess.

31:11.853 --> 31:14.538
-You do?
-Sure.

31:16.266 --> 31:19.376
Malcolm and I had
a disagreement.

31:20.938 --> 31:23.213
He's become convinced
that his father

31:23.365 --> 31:25.624
is a victim in all of this.

31:25.776 --> 31:27.426
Damn it, Martin.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.763
There's no good outcome here,
Jess.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.467
If they find him,
bring him back alive,

31:35.619 --> 31:37.543
he's back in your lives.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.062
If they take him out...

31:40.232 --> 31:42.316
My children lose their father.

31:43.385 --> 31:45.027
It's okay to hope
for that, you know?

31:46.647 --> 31:48.739
Martin put you through hell.

31:50.600 --> 31:54.411
That ghost?
It's not a friendly one.

31:59.401 --> 32:04.496
And in my weaker moments,
I want him dead, too.

32:04.648 --> 32:07.424
For you.

32:07.575 --> 32:09.259
Maybe it would, uh...

32:12.673 --> 32:14.139
Maybe things could be different.

32:16.343 --> 32:19.019
I don't want to keep secrets
from you anymore.

32:20.497 --> 32:22.088
-Hey.
-(sighs)

32:22.182 --> 32:24.066
They're just thoughts.

32:25.127 --> 32:27.361
They don't make you
a bad person.

32:29.782 --> 32:31.990
It's the actions that matter.

32:38.532 --> 32:39.998
You're right.

32:40.867 --> 32:42.334
(Jessica sighs)

32:43.128 --> 32:45.379
Of course you're right.

32:47.782 --> 32:49.132
Oh.

32:51.786 --> 32:54.262
This will all be over soon.

32:55.975 --> 32:58.392
My brother's in trouble.

32:59.961 --> 33:01.144
Again.

33:02.039 --> 33:03.480
That's it?

33:03.707 --> 33:05.148
Malcolm disappears,

33:05.300 --> 33:06.708
and you're not even worried?

33:06.727 --> 33:07.876
I'm always worried.

33:07.894 --> 33:09.394
But I'm also pissed.

33:09.546 --> 33:11.880
We were together,
working the search for Martin,

33:11.898 --> 33:13.215
until we had an argument.

33:13.233 --> 33:14.716
And then he went rogue.

33:14.718 --> 33:15.808
Not this time.

33:15.828 --> 33:16.976
At least...

33:17.070 --> 33:19.246

33:27.731 --> 33:28.839
Capshaw.

33:28.990 --> 33:31.916
I tried calling him back,
but his phone's dead.

33:32.069 --> 33:34.011
Or... worse.

33:35.072 --> 33:39.257
But... if he means
anything to you,

33:39.351 --> 33:40.592
help me.

33:40.744 --> 33:42.077
Please.

33:42.095 --> 33:44.396
Tell me what you know.

33:58.929 --> 34:00.520

34:00.539 --> 34:01.946
(footsteps approaching)

34:02.949 --> 34:05.709
Don't worry.
I've no plans to hurt you.

34:05.860 --> 34:08.712
Although I'm not sure...

34:08.863 --> 34:11.339
there's room for three.

34:12.367 --> 34:13.775
Your father

34:13.794 --> 34:16.702
is so close
to finally committing

34:16.797 --> 34:18.889
to our life together.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.392
Well, you know
I can't do that, Vivian.

34:22.619 --> 34:25.044
Not until you agree
to let go of my son.

34:25.064 --> 34:27.564
Oh, Malcolm came with me
willingly.

34:27.715 --> 34:29.215
Why did you do that?

34:29.234 --> 34:32.903
Don't you share the popular
opinion about Martin Whitly?

34:33.054 --> 34:35.146
Of course I do.

34:35.299 --> 34:36.907
He's a psychopath.

34:37.058 --> 34:39.968
An unrepentant murderer.

34:39.986 --> 34:41.995
Then why are you here?

34:45.584 --> 34:48.627
Because he also happens
to be my father.

34:56.002 --> 34:58.077
Tell me what you want from me.

34:58.097 --> 34:59.763
I want that.

35:00.841 --> 35:03.058
I want what he has.

35:05.162 --> 35:07.104
I want all of you.

35:24.123 --> 35:26.331
(breath trembles)

35:27.200 --> 35:29.534
Is this Logan Zeiger's place?

35:30.520 --> 35:33.705
He got a bit defensive
when we came calling.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.465
Because he understands me.

35:35.617 --> 35:38.042
I understand you, Vivian.

35:38.137 --> 35:39.970
This is what I do.

35:40.864 --> 35:43.548
You saw something in my father.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.992
You had a connection.

35:45.994 --> 35:48.311
But that doesn't mean
you're the same.

35:48.463 --> 35:49.871
He sees me.

35:49.931 --> 35:51.982
He's the only one.

35:52.133 --> 35:54.300
Martin Whitly is
a serial killer.

35:54.319 --> 35:57.637
Not to mention
a malignant narcissist.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.398
You want him to love you.

36:00.492 --> 36:01.992
But he can't.

36:09.743 --> 36:13.461
When was the last time
you mitigated an embolism?

36:16.082 --> 36:18.416
You're-you're not equipped
for that procedure here.

36:18.552 --> 36:21.845
Which is why,
when I complete it,

36:21.996 --> 36:24.514
you'll understand my greatness

36:24.741 --> 36:27.559
is aligned with your own.

36:31.431 --> 36:33.673
No, no, no, Vivian,
