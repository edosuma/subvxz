WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.469
And, Happy Quinn,
do you take this man

00:03.471 --> 00:06.305
to have and to hold,
for better or worse,

00:06.307 --> 00:08.140
richer or poorer,

00:08.142 --> 00:11.510
in sickness and health, for as
long as you both shall live?

00:11.512 --> 00:14.313
Sure.
By the power vested in me,

00:14.315 --> 00:16.315
I pronounce you husband
and wife.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.483
Okay, then.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.485
(Clears throat)

00:21.655 --> 00:23.322
You may kiss the bride.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.057
Oh, right.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.325
Yes.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.397
So you did kiss her!

00:31.399 --> 00:33.399
It's not like we enjoyed it.
Exactly.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.401
It was gross.
Come on.
I don't want to hear any more.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.102
I just want to focus
on convincing the ins

00:37.104 --> 00:38.337
that your marriage
is not a fraud.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.139
'Cause the sooner you get
your citizenship,

00:40.141 --> 00:42.474
sooner you get divorced,
sooner we can tie the knot,

00:42.476 --> 00:44.610
and give a legit home to the
genius bun in Happy's baby oven.

00:44.612 --> 00:48.113
It's going to be okay.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.186
Huh? Huh?
Our honeymoon album.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.456
It's... Tahiti!

00:57.458 --> 00:59.124
Walter:
We used Photoshop.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.427
Ins couldn't tell six years ago
when we were first vetted,

01:01.429 --> 01:03.462
so we'll be able
to dupe them again.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.530
There's no joy.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.231
There's no emotion.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.267
Who was your ins case worker,
Mr. Magoo?

01:08.269 --> 01:10.536
Mr. haverbrook.
He was 82.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.271
We were one of his last
cases before he retired.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.956
He had cataracts.

01:13.957 --> 01:15.640
Cabe: Talk to my insurance
carrier; It's all covered.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.444
Well, you found the mess,
now you clean it up.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.146
Proctologist?

01:21.148 --> 01:22.281
Cabe: 24-hour plumber.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.349
Pipe in my kitchen burst
water everywhere

01:24.351 --> 01:26.452
and now they found a rupture in
the main line going to my house.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.287
Is that why you're
here on a Friday night?

01:28.289 --> 01:31.523
Nope! Sly mentioned that you
picked up a private job

01:31.525 --> 01:34.159
at the Los Angeles
museum of science and history.

01:34.161 --> 01:36.695
There's a couple of traveling
exhibits I want to see:

01:36.697 --> 01:39.364
Birds of prey
and weaponry pavilion.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.266
How'd you pull off getting
to do it at night

01:41.268 --> 01:42.601
away from the crowds
and tourists?

01:42.603 --> 01:45.437
The imaging equipment that
we're using requires us

01:45.439 --> 01:47.840
to turn off the security
sensors in the facility,

01:47.842 --> 01:50.709
or it will interfere
with our readings.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.211
If we did it in the day and

01:52.212 --> 01:53.712
someone knew that the security
was off, then--

01:53.714 --> 01:56.748
someone could walk off with
a priceless artifact. Copy.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.584
(Swallows)

01:58.586 --> 02:00.986
Too much pizza?

02:00.987 --> 02:03.387
No, Happy's had morning sickness
and I'm feeling sympathy pains.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.308
Seriously?

02:06.309 --> 02:09.227
You want your stomach to hurt?
I can make it hurt for real.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.897
Hey. Why the hostility?

02:11.899 --> 02:14.500
I'm sympathizing
with your pain,

02:14.502 --> 02:16.368
which could be ameliorated
if you'd just

02:16.370 --> 02:17.736
eat more foods high
in iron and protein.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.238
You're micro-managing.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.639
'Cause I'm macro-worried!

02:20.641 --> 02:23.142
You are carrying the
product of our love!

02:23.144 --> 02:26.178
Not to mention some vigorous
whoopee-making, huh?

02:26.180 --> 02:27.579
He tried to get me to eat
steak and eggs

02:27.581 --> 02:28.914
from kevelsky's this morning.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.283
I can't eat steak in the A.M.

02:31.284 --> 02:33.651
It's fuel for the growing seed i
planted in your fertile pasture.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.787
I'm done here.
Follow me, and I'll kick you

02:35.789 --> 02:38.590
in the place that will end
your seed-planting days forever.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.895
You see how ornery she is?

02:42.897 --> 02:46.431
She doesn't merely prefer to be
married before the baby comes,

02:46.433 --> 02:49.501
she has a very real
psychological need

02:49.503 --> 02:51.503
to be married before
that baby comes.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.838
I know what she wants.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.607
Not what she wants.
What she needs.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.777
She grew up in a dozen
orphanages and foster homes.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.613
Our child being born into
a complete fully functioning

03:01.615 --> 03:05.651
legally-bound family
represents security.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.653
The thought of that not
happening causes her

03:07.655 --> 03:10.189
intense stress, and intense
stress hurts the baby.

03:10.191 --> 03:13.592
So you need to get
your citizenship asap

03:13.594 --> 03:15.594
and divorce the mother
of my child,

03:15.596 --> 03:17.930
so that I can marry her before
the infant becomes an outfant.

03:17.932 --> 03:20.632
Maybe I could expedite matters.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.702
Expedite what? How?

03:23.703 --> 03:26.771
I ask the ins to expedite
Walt's citizenship application.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.941
I can't pull any strings
per se,

03:28.943 --> 03:30.776
'cause his marriage is a sham.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.712
If I get caught asking for
a favor, my career is cooked.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.948
But?
But if I explain that Walt

03:35.950 --> 03:38.550
is a government contractor
working on high-clearance

03:38.552 --> 03:41.453
international cases,
i could argue that

03:41.455 --> 03:43.622
he could get in and out
of the country faster

03:43.624 --> 03:45.924
if he was a citizen carrying
a U.S. passport.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.227
They could move his paperwork
to the front of the line.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.329
Why am I just hearing
about this now?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.498
It's risky.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.733
Expedited review

03:54.735 --> 03:57.002
means extra scrutiny.

03:57.004 --> 04:00.239
Extra scrutiny could uncover
our marriage as bogus

04:00.241 --> 04:03.542
and get me deported, so the best
move is to just wait it out,

04:03.544 --> 04:06.712
so I get my citizenship
through the normal channels.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.880
So speeding things up was
an option, but you didn't

04:08.882 --> 04:10.616
consider it 'cause it could
affect you negatively.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.950
How about me?

04:11.952 --> 04:14.686
Or Happy? Or Tobias
merriweather Curtis Jr.?

04:14.688 --> 04:17.289
Merriweather?
It's a family name.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.458
Once again, you've
mastered the art of

04:19.460 --> 04:20.892
thinking only of yourself.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.930
He's just upset.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.938
(Sighs)

04:37.011 --> 04:39.011
Call ins.
Try to speed things up.

04:39.013 --> 04:42.648
Okay.
If you say so.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.583
Paige called.
Ralph's at the sitter,

04:44.585 --> 04:45.984
she and sly are headed
to the museum.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.669
Let's hit it.

04:47.670 --> 04:49.353
Maybe a case where no one's
shootin' at us

04:49.356 --> 04:52.057
will take everybody's
mind off of things.

04:52.059 --> 04:55.427
What exactly are you doing
at the museum, anyway?

04:55.429 --> 04:56.895
Woman:
As you can see,

04:56.897 --> 04:58.630
the decay on the pillar
expanded rapidly

04:58.632 --> 05:00.799
over the past several weeks.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.735
Growth rate is 538%,
but that's just an estimate

05:03.737 --> 05:06.438
because visitors in security
film are blocking my view.

05:06.440 --> 05:10.575
Wish someone would block my
view of you, crocodile dundee.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.160
It's ornithology wear.

05:12.161 --> 05:13.744
The birds of prey exhibit has
a world-class

05:13.747 --> 05:15.380
trained falcon named Reginald.

05:15.382 --> 05:17.032
Toby: Trained birds
are an abomination.

05:17.033 --> 05:18.683
You really think that majestic
creature wants to dance

05:18.686 --> 05:20.686
for the man every time the
pied Piper blows his flute?

05:20.688 --> 05:22.037
Pied Piper controlled rats.

05:22.038 --> 05:23.387
Whatever. You look like the
man from<i> curious George.</i>

05:23.390 --> 05:24.873
Paige:
Guys,

05:24.874 --> 05:26.357
maybe we can save
this riveting conversation

05:26.360 --> 05:27.926
for after the job is done?
Can we do that?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.763
Yes.
I'm-I'm not sure.
His outfit's really awful.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.666
You were saying, Ms. Stafford?

05:34.668 --> 05:37.803
Well, um, we've had
four archaeologists

05:37.805 --> 05:39.938
give cursory visual exams
to the piece.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.641
But none are certain
what's caused the decay,

05:42.643 --> 05:44.343
nor are they willing
to take samples

05:44.345 --> 05:47.446
or work on the pillar,
because it's so fragile.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.548
Worried about lawsuits
if they make it worse.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.516
Damn lawyers.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.052
Exactly.
Scorpion's the only group

05:54.054 --> 05:56.355
that'll work without
insurance coverage.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.590
I've been trying to get them
to let me buy insurance

05:58.592 --> 05:59.691
for two years.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.460
Humans need insurance coverage.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.428
We're scorpion.
We don't make mistakes.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.664
(Softly):
I can't find my binoculars.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.732
Ah.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.569
Ms. Stafford, we can help
solve your problem.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.572
Digital tomography of the pillar
will show exactly where

06:13.574 --> 06:14.840
interior instability lies.

06:14.842 --> 06:18.143
I'll calculate its
load-bearing capacity.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.045
And a software we designed
will let me engineer a rebuild.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.048
And I'll use six specialized
biochemicals I mixed myself

06:23.050 --> 06:24.683
to pinpoint what
molds, bacteria,

06:24.685 --> 06:26.551
or polysaccharides are
causing the problem.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.737
Thousands of years ago,

06:28.738 --> 06:30.922
fungi was used to adhere
concrete, and those spores

06:30.924 --> 06:33.058
could've been reactivated
from L.A. pollution,

06:33.060 --> 06:34.760
pacific salt air,
or something else.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.829
We'll identify the issue and
stop it from happening again.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.865
Yes, we're anxious
for you to begin.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.166
Well, let's get
crack-a-lackin'.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.801
My Happy needs her sleep.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.803
Before you do,
a few things:

06:44.805 --> 06:46.071
As you know,
the alarm system's off

06:46.073 --> 06:47.739
so you can use your machinery.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.741
You'll be locked inside
till morning.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.844
Interior security gates
are engaged at every exit.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.413
But in case of emergency,

06:54.415 --> 06:56.548
the two guards have keys
to let you out.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.116
Finally,

06:58.118 --> 07:02.521
this museum is full
of irreplaceable pieces.

07:02.523 --> 07:06.024
Like hebe,
daughter of hera and Zeus.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.194
It alone is worth
over $10 million.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.729
Please be careful.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.197
Everything will go smoothly.

07:12.199 --> 07:15.767
Wonderful.
Lockdown's in 15 minutes.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.637
So if there's more equipment
in your cars, get it now.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.872
Otherwise, see you in 12 hours.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.073
Good luck...

07:22.075 --> 07:23.975
And thank you.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.579
See you later, suckers.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.214
I'm gonna go check out
some weapons.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.532
Toby: Damn it!

07:30.533 --> 07:31.849
I only got five
of the six chemicals.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.084
I forgot to mix the last one.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.753
What do you mean, you forgot?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.822
I packed a bottle of
this indigestion medicine

07:36.824 --> 07:38.757
'cause I was gonna use
its bismuth subsalicylate

07:38.759 --> 07:40.792
for a little kick to my potion.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.828
I saw I had six bottles in
the bag, my mind registered

07:42.830 --> 07:44.629
I had what I needed
when I really didn't.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.098
I've been a little
distracted lately. My bad.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.700
Paige:
I'll drive you back
to the garage

07:48.702 --> 07:50.502
so you can whip up
what you need.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.003
Thanks.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.142
In case you get cold later...

07:57.144 --> 07:58.844
Studies show that warm incuba...

07:58.846 --> 08:01.012
Toby, she's fine. Come on,
you're holding everybody up.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.482
Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.184
Is something that I'm doing
interfering with your life?

08:06.186 --> 08:07.519
Gee, I wonder how that feels.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.020
That's okay.
Okay? Go.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.589
I love you.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.794
Go.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.728
Well, since we can't do
anything till Toby gets back

08:17.731 --> 08:19.130
and you guys are setting
up the dt scan, I was...

08:19.132 --> 08:20.999
You can go see the falcon.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.734
Excelsior.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.103
Lead aprons are heavy.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.005
Oh, yeah, speaking of which,

08:27.006 --> 08:28.906
I will handle the scanner,
and you wait in the hall.

08:28.909 --> 08:29.841
Excuse me?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.209
Radiation and pregnancy...

08:31.210 --> 08:32.576
Aren't an issue for
a low-level dt scan,

08:32.579 --> 08:34.329
when I take precautions.

08:34.330 --> 08:36.080
I've already got one man in
my life telling me what to do.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.215
I don't need another.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.917
Understood.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.127
Who's a handsome boy?

08:49.129 --> 08:50.695
Reginald is!

08:50.697 --> 08:52.163
Oh!

08:55.802 --> 08:57.702
<i> Falco tinnunculus.</i>

08:57.704 --> 09:01.306
Chestnut plumage, dark Iris,
yellow talons:

09:01.308 --> 09:05.577
Just waiting to snatch up
a little field mouse.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.579
But you can't snatch me
up, no, 'cause...

09:07.581 --> 09:08.947
You're in your little pokey.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.982
(Squawking)
(Gasps)

09:10.984 --> 09:14.319
I was just kidding... Reggie.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.620
(Squawking)

09:15.622 --> 09:16.922
Something wrong, buddy?

09:16.924 --> 09:18.623
That was
a distress cry.

09:18.625 --> 09:19.658
You hear something?

09:19.660 --> 09:21.826
(Squawking)

09:21.828 --> 09:23.962
Don't worry, fella,
just sit tight,

09:23.964 --> 09:27.232
and I'm gonna get you some help.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.054
(Whispering):
Sweet.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.928
Pardon me, sirs. Reginald
is acting incredibly agitated.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.898
I was just wondering if
there's perhaps an overnight

09:59.900 --> 10:01.766
veterinary service...

10:04.271 --> 10:06.738
Injection marks?

10:06.740 --> 10:09.774
Cabe, do you copy?
Cabe, do you hear me?

10:09.776 --> 10:11.276
Cabe?

10:13.046 --> 10:16.114
Security footage.
Phones?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.315
(Busy signal)

10:17.317 --> 10:19.634
(Sighs)

10:19.635 --> 10:21.952
Someone must be using jammers
to block our communication.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.823
We gotta get out of here.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.258
Okay, uh...

10:27.260 --> 10:30.195
Pardon me, fellas.
Just looking for keys.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.130
Just looking for keys.
Okay...

10:34.234 --> 10:37.802
Oh...
Okay, no keys.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.270
This is bad.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.776
(Metallic scrape)

10:45.779 --> 10:47.112
Sly?

10:48.315 --> 10:51.049
(Grunting)

10:59.259 --> 11:02.060
Cabe?
(Panting)

11:02.062 --> 11:04.029
Cabe, we have a problem.

11:04.031 --> 11:07.132
Yeah, I kind of
figured that out.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.467
What the heck
is happening?

11:08.468 --> 11:09.801
The guards were
drugged unconscious,

11:09.803 --> 11:11.069
and now you're
stockading people?

11:11.071 --> 11:13.772
Oh, no, this guy
didn't have a gun.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.974
You don't break in to a place
like this unarmed and alone.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.677
Which means he's got friends
in here that are strapped.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.312
We gotta tell Walter and Happy
that we're in trouble.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.858
I think they already know
we're in trouble.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.108
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
take it easy.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.500
They tied us well. Don't bother.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.435
I'm not trying to untie.
Those guys had some

12:17.437 --> 12:20.138
dirt on their clothes and it's
itching the hell out of me.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.107
Yeah, well, we got bigger
problems than scratchy skin.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.642
They lured us here.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.176
What do you mean? They
don't even know who we are.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.278
No, but they knew
someone like us would come.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.447
It can't just be a coincidence
that those criminals

12:29.449 --> 12:32.083
chose to infiltrate the museum
the same night

12:32.085 --> 12:34.085
that we have to shut off
the security system.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.221
They compromised the pillar.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.389
Probably with
some corrosive.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.958
Remember sly said
the tourists

12:39.960 --> 12:41.226
were blocking his view
of the pillar.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.061
I bet you those
were the bad guys.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.430
With their backs turned to the
cameras they quickly sprayed

12:45.432 --> 12:47.799
some astringent on the pillar
over a course of weeks...

12:47.801 --> 12:50.201
Knowing experts would be
called in with imaging equipment

12:50.203 --> 12:51.503
to examine the damage.

12:51.505 --> 12:54.172
And the security systems
would have to be shut off.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.074
This whole thing
was a setup.

12:56.076 --> 12:59.144
We just happen to be the
patsies who took the job.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.812
What do you think
they were stealing?

13:00.814 --> 13:02.147
No idea.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.883
All I know
is that those two thugs

13:04.885 --> 13:06.317
think that we're
the only people in here,

13:06.319 --> 13:08.987
so hopefully sly and cabe
know what's going on

13:08.989 --> 13:11.156
and are trying to figure out
how to get us free.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.391
I-i thought you never
left anyone behind.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.527
If we try to untie them,
we could get caught

13:15.529 --> 13:17.228
and I don't
have a gun.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.863
We need to get
reinforcements.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.232
(Clattering)

13:23.136 --> 13:25.236
Now we know what
they're up to.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.805
They're stealing gems.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.341
We need to get to
the authorities.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.046
That is a formidable gate.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.281
Oh, are you kidding?

13:36.283 --> 13:38.349
You can't lift that.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.919
There's no way we can
call anybody for help.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.520
Calm down.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.289
Those guys are focused
on what they're stealing.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.891
They think they've caught
the only two people in here.

13:46.893 --> 13:48.459
So we've got
the tactical advantage.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.295
What about the guy
from the stockade?

13:50.297 --> 13:52.263
They don't hear from him
for long enough,

13:52.265 --> 13:54.566
they go looking for him,
and then he tells them about us.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.835
And that's why we got to
figure out how to get word

13:56.837 --> 13:58.903
to Toby and Paige
as fast as we can.

13:58.905 --> 14:01.206
You're the genius.
Come up with something.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.844
There is a way.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.179
But it's unconventional.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.184
You're sending a bird?

14:13.186 --> 14:14.886
Not a bird.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.921
A falcon.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.557
Just got to mix
these biological agents.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.626
Shouldn't take long.
Okay, but you
better hustle.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.229
You know how Walt gets when
efficiency is compromised.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.630
You don't
have to tell me.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.366
Hey, speaking of ol' Wally-boy,
it's kind of crazy

14:28.368 --> 14:30.301
he's been married
this whole time,

14:30.303 --> 14:32.871
don't you think?
I don't know. It's not like
it's a real marriage.

14:32.873 --> 14:36.241
Real enough to screw up my life.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.909
You're not mad? I mean,

14:37.911 --> 14:40.011
he was smoochin' you while
he was hitched to my girl.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.579
That's kind of messed up.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.449
No, 'cause any smooching we did
was a mistake

14:44.451 --> 14:46.317
to begin with.
Besides, I'm...

14:46.319 --> 14:49.420
With Tim now, so it's all moot.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.990
Man. Ow.
What-- are you okay?

14:51.992 --> 14:53.424
Yeah, it's just,
my nipples are sore.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.493
I'm experiencing
commiseration lactation.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.929
Don't even want to know.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.397
It's when the male partner
of a pregnant woman

14:59.399 --> 15:01.900
or woman who recently
gave birth also lactates.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.902
That's insane. You're insane.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.137
A 38-year-old Sri lankan man
nursed his daughters

15:06.139 --> 15:07.672
when his wife died
during childbirth.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.108
Also, male Indonesian
fruit bats.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.509
And in the 1896 compendium

15:11.511 --> 15:13.278
<i> anomalies and</i>
<i> curiosities of med...</i>

15:13.280 --> 15:14.679
Toby, look at me.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.981
You're a man of medicine,
and in medicine

15:16.983 --> 15:18.349
rare things happen
rarely, right?

15:18.351 --> 15:20.218
So...

15:20.220 --> 15:22.287
Do you really think
you're lactating

15:22.289 --> 15:24.522
and-and getting
morning sickness?

15:24.524 --> 15:27.025
No.
So why are you having symptoms?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.027
Because I'm scared to death.
Not for me to be a father,

15:29.029 --> 15:30.495
but for Happy to be a mother.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.963
Nurturing, kind and patient

15:31.965 --> 15:34.032
are not the hallmarks
of Ms. Happy Quinn.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.967
I might have
to mama bear this cub.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.969
It's not like<i> I</i> know what to do.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.271
Maybe I should wax my chest
in case the milk comes.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.107
Take a deep breath, listen.

15:43.109 --> 15:47.045
I am raising Ralph alone
and there are two of you,

15:47.047 --> 15:50.348
so that makes it
easier right there.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.618
Happy has her quirks,
so do you-- so what?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.186
Parents don't have
to be perfect,

15:55.188 --> 15:57.388
they just have to be there,
and loving.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.191
So, you both
gonna love that baby?

16:00.193 --> 16:02.160
With all our hearts.
I already do.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.962
So you'll be golden.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.597
Okay, buddy?

16:05.598 --> 16:07.231
Okay, I'm gonna
call Tim in Denver

16:07.233 --> 16:09.233
and see how the homeland
conference is going.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.270
Hey.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.405
If we're half the parents
you are, our kid'll be lucky.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.642
Thank you for the pep talk.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.462
No problem.

16:20.463 --> 16:22.213
Now shake a leg
and finish up those chemicals.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.515
We need to get back.
Oh, if there were any issues,

16:24.517 --> 16:26.050
we'd have heard from 'em.

16:26.052 --> 16:29.053
Thieves. Guns.
I'm sure they'll get the gist.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.588
How are they gonna
get the message?

16:30.590 --> 16:33.358
Well, you're going to
put this on Reginald's anklet

16:33.360 --> 16:35.760
and then he is going
to fly it to our friends.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.662
How come
i got to deal with

16:37.664 --> 16:39.197
the sharp-taloned beast?
Because,

16:39.199 --> 16:41.699
while I love birds,
i am wholly terrified of them.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.469
How's he gonna know
where he's going?

16:44.471 --> 16:47.171
Reginald was trained to fly
on this pulse anklet.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.473
He'll only fly
when it pulses,

16:48.475 --> 16:50.241
so I'll program
the approximate amount of time

16:50.243 --> 16:53.111
to get him to the garage.
But we got to do this fast,

16:53.113 --> 16:55.246
because they might not be
at the garage for much longer.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.582
He's just gonna land outside
and wait for the doc?

16:57.584 --> 16:59.751
Well, as long as
he picks up on Toby's musk.

16:59.753 --> 17:02.787
Recent research indicates
the migration patterns of birds

17:02.789 --> 17:05.223
are heavily decided by scent.

17:05.225 --> 17:08.393
So now we just need something
with Toby's stink on it.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.461
(Grunting softly)

17:11.765 --> 17:13.164
That's a dumb idea.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.732
Yeah, well, if I can
get to the chromic acid

17:14.734 --> 17:17.068
that Toby was gonna
use to clean the pillar, then

17:17.070 --> 17:18.436
it might be able
eat through the rope.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.138
How exactly do you
plan on pouring

17:20.140 --> 17:21.406
caustic chemicals
with your feet?

17:21.408 --> 17:23.674
One problem at a time.

17:23.676 --> 17:27.078
(Grunting):
You know what?

17:29.749 --> 17:31.149
It's not happening.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.250
We need a real plan.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.318
Well, I invite you
to offer one up.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.461
I say we climb up the banner.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.834
We got to be quiet. They're in
the gem room down the hall.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.411
Put this on before you climb up.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.146
Are you gonna mother me, too?

18:02.148 --> 18:04.382
We need this to get out of here.
Now trust me.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.852
All right. All right.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.821
You go first. Hurry.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.323
That's it, that's it.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.530
(Grunting softly)

18:24.304 --> 18:26.604
(Grunting softly)

18:27.807 --> 18:29.574
Come on, come on, come on.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.142
(Grunts)
Shh, shh, shh.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.343
Okay.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.746
No, no, no, no, no....

18:42.155 --> 18:43.754
That was
a $10 million statue.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.256
Not anymore.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.158
You guys really need
to get insurance.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.559
Now go.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.920
So, I had another worry.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.722
What if our kid's stupid?

19:17.724 --> 19:20.158
That's a terrible thing to say.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.727
I don't mean stupid.
I mean like you.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.896
That isn't any better.

19:24.898 --> 19:26.664
I mean not a genius.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.933
Genius is hereditary,
it's not guaranteed.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.568
We could have a normal.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.236
I do not relate well to normals.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.771
Happy neither.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.940
Well, if I can raise a genius
child, you can raise a normal.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.209
Trust me, raising a genius child
isn't easy.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.410
I have five of them.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.345
What?

19:41.347 --> 19:43.281
Oh.
(Chuckles)

19:43.283 --> 19:45.650
I see what you did there.
That's very funny.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.618
Oh! Kovelsky's up ahead.
Pull over.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.953
No, we got to get back.
No, pull over. I'm hungry.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.388
I want to get
some steak and eggs.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.856
Bull.
You want it for Happy.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.424
Don't you remember our
conversation in the garage?

19:53.426 --> 19:55.726
It was great.
It's still sinking in.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.512
Come on.

19:57.513 --> 19:59.297
I'm obsessing over my kid.
You should understand that.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.598
Fine.
Sly's gonna be annoyed.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.899
He didn't want
to stay up all night.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.935
Oh, please.
He's enjoying quality time

20:03.937 --> 20:06.370
with his feathered friend.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.209
Reginald.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.243
What's taking them

20:12.245 --> 20:13.978
so long?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.746
(Soft footsteps tapping)

20:15.748 --> 20:17.281
(Panting)

20:17.283 --> 20:18.749
Sorry we're late.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.218
To the point that we missed

20:20.220 --> 20:21.619
our window for Reggie
to catch Toby and Paige

20:21.621 --> 20:23.955
back at the garage.
By my calculations,

20:23.957 --> 20:24.989
they're now at
Fairfax and third.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.490
And there's no way for a falcon

20:26.492 --> 20:28.526
to pick up a scent
inside of a moving car.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.294
(Whispering):
What if they're not in a car?

20:30.296 --> 20:31.879
(Whispering):
They're not gonna
walk back here.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.463
Fairfax and third
is near kovelsky's.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.632
If I know Toby,
he'll stop

20:34.634 --> 20:36.334
to get me those damn
steak and eggs.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.868
He'll be out of the
car, on the street.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.737
I can work with that.

20:39.739 --> 20:40.771
I'm connected wirelessly

20:40.773 --> 20:42.006
to the anklet that cabe

20:42.008 --> 20:43.941
put on our flying
vertebrate earlier.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.743
I just need to readjust

20:45.745 --> 20:49.447
pulse duration for
the new location and, blammo,

20:49.449 --> 20:52.416
he's headed for kovelsky's.
We just got to prep the bird.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.418
Give me your
sweatshirt.
Shh.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.387
Shh.

20:57.323 --> 21:00.391
(Squawks softly)

21:04.664 --> 21:06.364
Okay, okay...

21:06.366 --> 21:09.300
Get a beakful of this, Reggie.

21:09.302 --> 21:12.370
This is the man
you're looking for.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.272
That should be enough
for him to get a scent.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.273
Time to let him out.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.674
Soon as I do this,

21:16.676 --> 21:18.476
it's gonna draw attention to us.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.278
So be ready to run.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.613
Setting the pulse now.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.948
(Beeping)

21:23.950 --> 21:25.383
(Grunts)

21:28.321 --> 21:30.021
(Screeching)
Fly, Reggie, fly!

21:32.492 --> 21:34.458
(Gunshots)

21:34.460 --> 21:35.426
Run!

21:37.797 --> 21:39.864
(Panting)

21:49.609 --> 21:51.609
Come on!

21:51.611 --> 21:53.611
I'm not fast!

21:53.613 --> 21:56.414
(Rats squeaking)

21:57.950 --> 21:59.450
Pied Piper controlled rats.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.551
Why the hell are you stopping?

22:00.553 --> 22:01.852
Keep going.
I've got an idea.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.788
(Grunts)

22:03.790 --> 22:05.856
(Rats squeaking)

22:10.897 --> 22:13.431
(Shouting)

22:16.102 --> 22:19.470
High iron, high protein.
Steak and eggs does a baby good.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.739
I ate French fries and
ice cream, and Ralph's fine.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.007
It's the exception,
it's not the rule.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.876
Okay, here's a rule:
Dumb it down.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.813
Okay, when I was pregnant,
Ralph's dad drew was fantastic.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.815
You know why?
He wasn't smart.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.950
He didn't try to tell me
what I needed; He just asked.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.453
So when I craved salty-sweet,
he gave it to me.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.922
You are a genius, so you
like to solve problems.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.658
But pregnant women
do not want solutions.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.394
Happy wants an errand boy
who's a good listener.

22:43.396 --> 22:47.398
So for once in your life,
Toby, don't be so smart.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.434
(Reginald screeching)

22:51.704 --> 22:53.838
(Screams)

22:55.708 --> 22:56.974
What the hell, man?!
What?

22:56.976 --> 22:58.909
Wait, is that the
falcon from the museum?

22:58.911 --> 23:01.045
Can't tell. My vision's a little
blurry from the heart attack.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.614
Paige:
There's a note.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.485
You owe me $13.50 plus tip.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.421
(Toby groans softly)

23:10.423 --> 23:12.089
Oh, god.

23:12.091 --> 23:15.025
"Thieves in museum-- guns--
we're trapped-- no comms"?

23:15.027 --> 23:17.495
"Guards drugged-- gate
still locked-- bring help."

23:17.497 --> 23:19.797
Oh, my god. We got
to call homeland.

23:24.670 --> 23:27.104
Cabe's prisoner
is gone.

23:27.106 --> 23:30.040
There's no way he busted out
of those stocks.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.575
His people freed him.

23:31.577 --> 23:32.710
Well, they're
at full strength now.

23:32.712 --> 23:33.778
We're even at four to four.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.179
But we're outgunned.
Many to zero.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.781
Are we even safe in here?

23:36.783 --> 23:38.383
We're not safe anywhere.

23:38.384 --> 23:39.984
They're focused on the robbery,
but I'm pretty sure

23:39.986 --> 23:41.719
they've got one or two guys
searching for us.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.120
Guys we know nothing about.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.022
They're aldorrian,
for whatever that's worth.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.557
I could tell from their
dialect of Spanish.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.092
Aldorrian?

23:48.094 --> 23:51.462
They've been involved in
a vicious border war for years.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.531
They've been getting shellacked
recently.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.867
Okay, so long-term conflict with
a much more powerful neighbor.

23:56.869 --> 24:00.471
They rob a gem exhibit to fund
an outmatched military.

24:00.473 --> 24:01.839
Why so far from home?

24:01.841 --> 24:03.774
There's plenty
to steal in south America.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.110
Yeah, and why would they
steal a few million in gems

24:06.112 --> 24:07.178
when this place
has a lot more

24:07.180 --> 24:08.446
valuable stuff?

24:10.049 --> 24:13.050
Because it's not about money--

24:13.052 --> 24:15.186
it's about a bomb.

24:15.188 --> 24:18.055
There's an asteroid
in this exhibit.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.658
<i> Its core contains</i>
<i> an extremely rare substance</i>

24:20.660 --> 24:23.861
<i> called tantalum-181.</i>
<i>That's what they came here for.</i>

24:23.863 --> 24:25.863
Man:
Peralta.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.256
Cabe:
<i> How do asteroid guts</i>
<i> make a bomb?</i>

24:52.258 --> 24:53.657
They don't.
They make it worse.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.892
Does aldorria have
nuclear weapons?

24:54.894 --> 24:57.161
Intelligence reports
they have one,

24:57.163 --> 24:58.128
a black-market

24:58.130 --> 24:59.497
Soviet relic.

24:59.499 --> 25:00.965
They're gonna
salt it.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.967
Come again?
Salting is a process

25:02.969 --> 25:05.503
that ups the radioactivity
of a nuke's fallout

25:05.505 --> 25:09.073
by encasing the weapon in
a jacket of tantalum-181,

25:09.075 --> 25:13.077
which is transmuted upon
detonation into tantalum-182.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.979
And let me guess,
two's worse.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.114
Much. That weapon's gonna hurt
a lot more people

25:17.116 --> 25:18.516
for a lot longer time.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.784
And we can't let that happen.
Okay,

25:20.786 --> 25:22.786
so maybe we just
find someplace to hide

25:22.788 --> 25:26.123
and let Toby and Paige
bring the cops and such.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.492
'Cause I don't want
to get shot at again.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.860
That's not an option.
One, we don't know
if the falcon got to them.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.063
Two, those thieves clearly found
a way to sneak

25:33.065 --> 25:34.532
into the building,
so when they get what they need,

25:34.534 --> 25:35.933
they'll be able
to sneak back out again.

25:35.935 --> 25:39.003
Three, I was expecting
a quiet night at the museum,

25:39.005 --> 25:43.707
not tangling with
aldorrian asteroid pilferers.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.175
The only way to stop those guys
from stealing something

25:45.177 --> 25:48.212
with lethal potential
is if we steal it first.

25:48.214 --> 25:51.282
To get the goods, we're gonna
have to lure them out of here.

25:51.284 --> 25:54.251
So we're gonna go
medieval on their ass.
Oh, that sounds violent.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.786
Cabe:
There's no violence.
It's a con

25:55.788 --> 25:57.288
right out of the
hundred years' war.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.290
The English army
was low on supplies,

25:59.292 --> 26:01.625
so they lured the French
away from their camp

26:01.627 --> 26:03.127
so the brits
could rob it.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.194
How'd they pull it off?

26:04.196 --> 26:05.696
By making the French believe

26:05.697 --> 26:07.197
that a massive army
was assembling nearby.

26:07.199 --> 26:10.267
So first up,
we assemble an army...

26:10.269 --> 26:13.037
<i> We do that by taking</i>
<i> a video display</i>

26:13.039 --> 26:14.071
<i> from the great wars exhibit.</i>

26:14.073 --> 26:15.339
<i> We use one of fdr's speeches.</i>

26:15.341 --> 26:17.241
<i> He had an authoritarian voice.</i>

26:17.243 --> 26:18.776
Sylvester:
<i> We'll make it sound like a cop</i>
<i> with a bullhorn</i>

26:18.778 --> 26:21.879
<i> by refracting the sound waves</i>

26:21.881 --> 26:25.349
<i> over the varied textures and</i>
<i> curvatures of early pottery.</i>

26:25.351 --> 26:26.650
(Grunts)

26:26.652 --> 26:29.019
That was expensive.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.288
No matter how long

26:31.290 --> 26:33.057
it may take us...

26:33.059 --> 26:34.925
King Franklin
should get their attention.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.994
(Whirring)
(Fdr speaking indistinctly)

26:49.208 --> 26:50.908
And when they clear
out, we go in.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.676
Happy:
<i> They were drilling blindly,</i>

26:52.678 --> 26:53.811
but with our dt scanner,
we can find

26:53.813 --> 26:55.679
<i> the most direct path</i>
<i> to the core.</i>

26:55.681 --> 26:58.115
(Scanner clicking)

27:01.354 --> 27:03.988
Got the fastest route
to the tantalum.

27:03.990 --> 27:04.922
And finally,

27:04.924 --> 27:05.889
here,

27:05.891 --> 27:07.992
Sylvester and I make
enough noise

27:07.994 --> 27:08.993
so they don't

27:08.995 --> 27:10.361
hear you
drilling into

27:10.363 --> 27:11.395
the space rock.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.632
Freeze!

27:16.168 --> 27:17.901
Go, go.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.873
I hit the core.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.708
I just have to slowly back
the bit out.

27:24.710 --> 27:25.909
<i> Alto!</i>

27:41.193 --> 27:43.394
Oh, no.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.195
What?

27:45.197 --> 27:47.097
(Groans)
The bit's stuck.
I can't get it out.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.365
You have to.
We have to get the tantalum.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.700
Those guys
are gonna be back soon.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.435
This ain't
<i> the sword in the stone,</i>

27:51.436 --> 27:53.169
and I am not king Arthur.
(Sighs)

27:53.172 --> 27:55.189
Did cabe happen
to mention

27:55.190 --> 27:57.207
if the English hundred years'
war strategy had a backup plan?

28:03.349 --> 28:05.416
Those guys are gonna be
back any second. We have
to get the tantalum out.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.752
Back up.

28:08.754 --> 28:10.187
(Grunts)

28:15.695 --> 28:17.761
Effective.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.341
Come on!

28:35.214 --> 28:37.281
(Sirens wailing)

28:40.319 --> 28:41.952
Paige:
<i> We can't talk to the others</i>

28:41.954 --> 28:43.787
if the jammer's still killing
the signal at the museum.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.122
Well,
that's why I'm building this.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.924
Comm jammers
they're using sucks up

28:46.926 --> 28:48.892
signals from cell phones,
radios, everything.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.061
This baby I'm wiring
will sniff it out.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.796
We find it, we disable it.

28:52.798 --> 28:53.764
Hold on.

28:53.766 --> 28:56.767
(Engine revving)

28:57.737 --> 28:59.436
(Pants)
What are you doing?

28:59.438 --> 29:02.740
Switching from defense
to offense.

29:02.742 --> 29:05.743
Cabe, that is a 3,000-year-old
phoenician whaling harpoon.

29:05.745 --> 29:08.746
Damn right.
And I'm going fishing.

29:09.482 --> 29:11.782
(Groans)

29:18.924 --> 29:19.490
(Grunts)

29:20.893 --> 29:22.426
(Grunting)

29:27.299 --> 29:28.432
Come on, let's hustle.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.468
Toby:
Getting warmer,

29:31.470 --> 29:33.303
(beeping)
Warmer,

29:33.305 --> 29:35.305
hotter!

29:35.307 --> 29:37.941
There! Jammer's
in that grating.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.511
Me. Your shoulders. Now.

29:46.485 --> 29:47.551
(Grunting)

29:48.387 --> 29:52.256
Uh... big breakfast this
morning?

29:52.258 --> 29:54.491
Man up!

30:03.969 --> 30:06.170
Happy (Quietly):
How long are we staying here?

30:06.172 --> 30:08.438
Until we and this tantalum
can get out of here safely.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.174
But since they have
guns and we don't,

30:10.176 --> 30:13.377
I'm not sure
when that will be.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.217
Hey.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.420
Toby and Paige
will come through.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.290
Your baby's
gonna be fine.

30:26.292 --> 30:30.294
I know Toby believes that
i only think about myself,

30:30.296 --> 30:34.131
but I will do what is necessary
to protect your family.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.466
Even if that means that I have
to go back home to Ireland.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.402
You are home.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.070
We're not losing you,
and we're not

30:40.072 --> 30:41.238
breaking up scorpion.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.606
We'll do whatever it takes.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.211
You talk nonsense
like that again,

30:47.213 --> 30:49.279
I'll punch you in the neck.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.520
Toby's a fortunate guy.

30:56.522 --> 30:59.122
You know, I know ours
isn't a real marriage,

30:59.124 --> 31:02.459
but since the day I met you,
you've been a faithful friend,

31:02.461 --> 31:05.128
you've come through for me when
i needed it, you've helped me

31:05.130 --> 31:07.264
build scorpion
from nothing.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.132
That's loyalty,
selflessness,

31:09.134 --> 31:12.069
collaboration. If those are
the traits that one looks for

31:12.071 --> 31:14.371
in a spouse, then
you've been a...

31:17.209 --> 31:19.276
You've been
a great wife.

31:20.946 --> 31:22.446
Thank you.

31:22.448 --> 31:25.382
You're welcome.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.621
Wait. Wait. More to the left!
I can't reach it.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.490
(Toby groans)

31:33.492 --> 31:35.425
Trained at Harvard,
not cirque du soleil.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.627
(Groans softly)

31:36.629 --> 31:38.195
I got it!

31:38.197 --> 31:41.198
Okay. Now I just got
to deprogram it.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.333
(Both grunt)

31:43.335 --> 31:45.102
(Sighs)

31:45.104 --> 31:46.470
Hey. Guess it's
deprogrammed.

31:46.472 --> 31:49.273
Guys? It's us.
Do you copy?!

31:49.275 --> 31:51.541
Loud and clear.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.644
We're here, guys.
Where are you?

31:53.646 --> 31:55.545
We're at the main
doors with homeland!

31:55.547 --> 31:58.015
Interior gates are still down.
Fire department's

31:58.017 --> 32:00.250
coming with equipment to cut
through, but it'll take time.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.451
Are you guys safe?

32:01.453 --> 32:02.552
Yeah, we're hiding.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.588
Those thieves didn't
come for the gems.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.490
They came to steal
tantalum-181.

32:06.492 --> 32:07.958
That sounds bad.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.927
Yeah, later
I'll explain how bad.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.194
Well, we stole it first.

32:11.196 --> 32:12.796
They're still here,

32:12.797 --> 32:14.397
but I am gonna get the tantalum
to you through the gate.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.565
Cabe:
Walter,

32:15.567 --> 32:17.167
just stay
in position.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.269
Men are actively
hunting for us.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.038
Then I got to get the
tantalum out of here.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.306
Well, I have a gun.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.941
I can come and
provide cover for you.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.643
All right, we're at the
new americas exhibit.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.612
We're not far from
the main entrance.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.614
We're all the way
in the east wing.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.983
You're gonna have
to give me a minute.

32:32.985 --> 32:35.285
The longer I wait, the greater
the chance that they find me.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.420
Walter.

32:36.422 --> 32:39.056
Hey, you said it.

32:39.058 --> 32:42.459
This could hurt a lot of
people for a long time,

32:42.461 --> 32:45.095
so you stay here
and you stay hidden.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.681
(Grunting)
Paige:
Walter!

33:04.683 --> 33:06.049
Oh, my god,
do something!

33:06.051 --> 33:07.551
I don't have a clean shot!

33:07.553 --> 33:08.585
(Panting)

33:09.655 --> 33:11.355
(Grunting)

33:11.357 --> 33:13.557
(Glass clinking)

33:13.559 --> 33:14.591
(Gasps)

33:16.095 --> 33:18.261
(Gunshots)

33:18.263 --> 33:19.329
Walter?

33:19.331 --> 33:20.630
Are you all right?!

33:20.632 --> 33:22.332
No! He got the tantalum.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.601
Post at every exit!
They got a master key.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.570
Wait. On your face--
is that red dirt?

33:26.572 --> 33:28.572
It's from the guy
who tackled me.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.340
Happy got some on her earlier.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.075
Happy:
Walter, that's it-- the dirt.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.443
That's how
the thieves got in here.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.611
Same way
that they're getting out.

33:34.613 --> 33:35.579
We got to go to Mars.

33:35.581 --> 33:38.382
Great.
A scary tunnel.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.217
During those weeks they put
corrosive on that pillar.

33:40.219 --> 33:42.152
Some of that time was busy
digging this tunnel.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.520
Those dusty bastards
got a good head start.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.188
Tunnel has to be
several blocks long

33:45.190 --> 33:46.456
'cause they couldn't
have just dug it out

33:46.458 --> 33:48.091
in the middle of the city.
They needed privacy.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.794
The only shot we have is
to have the agents fan out

33:50.796 --> 33:52.362
and catch 'em
when they climb out.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.231
Covering every
possibility? Impossible.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.400
There's no way to tell
where this tunnel leads.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.667
Walter:
But there could be.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.403
First, I'll need Toby's bottle
of antacid

33:59.405 --> 34:01.104
for its ingredients.
Happy:
Bismuth

34:01.106 --> 34:03.106
subsalicylate burns bright.

34:03.107 --> 34:05.107
Exactly, so we need
to make a flare. Now, Paige,

34:05.110 --> 34:06.343
get to the roof next door now.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.811
And, Toby, make sure

34:07.812 --> 34:09.278
that the homeland agents
are ready to move.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.148
Guys...

34:11.150 --> 34:12.482
Now we go shopping.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.252
<i> First, some sugar</i>

34:15.254 --> 34:18.055
<i> and ammonium nitrate</i>
<i> from a cold pack.</i>

34:18.057 --> 34:19.423
<i> And then a length of hemp.</i>

34:19.425 --> 34:21.191
Sorry.

34:21.193 --> 34:24.061
(Hissing)

34:29.134 --> 34:31.635
All right. It's not pretty,
but it should work.

34:31.637 --> 34:34.438
(Sighs)

34:34.439 --> 34:37.240
Paige, look for the light
at the end of the tunnel.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.543
Doesn't even know
he made a joke.

34:40.345 --> 34:43.246
(Panting)

34:56.328 --> 34:58.395
Okay, Walter, I'm on the roof!

34:58.397 --> 35:00.330
Walter:
The tunnel could
let them out anywhere,

35:00.332 --> 35:01.665
so keep your eyes open.

35:03.635 --> 35:04.868
Fire in the hole!

35:10.375 --> 35:11.775
Walter,

35:11.777 --> 35:12.742
where the hell are you?!

35:12.744 --> 35:14.144
Walter:
Little help here!

35:14.146 --> 35:15.846
(Walter groaning)

35:15.848 --> 35:18.448
Okay, close it.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.450
It should blow

35:20.452 --> 35:21.384
any second.

35:21.386 --> 35:24.821
(Deep rumbling)

35:24.823 --> 35:26.490
Paige:
I see it!

35:26.492 --> 35:28.258
The tunnel opens at the corner
of sixth and grand!

35:33.832 --> 35:35.398
Agent:
Homeland.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.700
Hands in the air.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.768
Toby:
Feel free to wave them like

35:38.770 --> 35:40.303
you just don't care.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.538
(Siren blaring)

35:41.540 --> 35:42.839
I'd care if I were you,

35:42.841 --> 35:44.908
'cause you're going to prison.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.612
Hey, I heard
from St. Joe's.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.514
Museum guards are awake
and doing fine.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.382
Can't say the
same for Reginald.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.484
He looks depressed.
Think he misses me.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.685
Why do you look down?

35:55.687 --> 35:57.587
I got a call from the plumber.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.456
They found mold.

35:59.458 --> 36:02.392
I'm never stepping foot
in your house again.

36:02.394 --> 36:05.395
I got to get a full abatement,
clear out for two weeks.

36:05.397 --> 36:07.864
This sucks.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.566
Good news
for you guys, though.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.501
Considering the people
you helped catch today,

36:11.503 --> 36:14.638
the federal government's gonna
cover all damage to the museum.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.572
Sweet.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.707
Provided you get insurance.

36:17.709 --> 36:20.210
Ain't my money.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.514
Hey.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.483
Just want to thank you
for the advice earlier.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.451
I will do my best
to follow it.

36:28.453 --> 36:29.619
It's just I've, um...

36:29.621 --> 36:32.289
I've never been a dad before.

36:32.291 --> 36:35.325
You know?
(Laughs)
Me, neither. But, um,
I've been a parent

36:35.327 --> 36:36.960
for a while, so if
you ever need anything,

36:36.962 --> 36:39.663
my desk is the one right
in front of yours.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.698
Thanks.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.933
You know, holding my hand

36:42.935 --> 36:44.568
doesn't fall
within your job description.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.770
No, but it falls
within my "friend" description,

36:46.772 --> 36:48.672
so, that desk right there.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.640
Don't be a stranger.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.718
Solar panels
coming along?

37:01.720 --> 37:04.754
I'm gonna have this garage
green in no time.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.423
What you got there?

37:06.425 --> 37:08.758
It's a divorce gift
for your baby.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.560
It's hideous

37:10.562 --> 37:12.629
and heavy.
It's protective.

37:14.299 --> 37:16.433
Did you know that
on aircraft,

37:16.434 --> 37:18.568
you're exposed to as much
radiation as a chest X-ray?

37:18.570 --> 37:20.537
I'm a genius.
I know most things.
Well,

37:20.539 --> 37:22.839
what if you're on a plane with
Tobias merriweather Curtis Jr.?

37:22.841 --> 37:25.942
Merriweather?
Yeah, I need to tell you
something about my middle name.

37:27.246 --> 37:28.511
It's merriweather.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.013
You said it was Marcus.

37:30.015 --> 37:32.916
Anyway, this beanie
reduces radiation exposure

37:32.918 --> 37:35.518
to a brain that does not yet
have a fully-formed skull.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.287
I call it, "the lead head."

37:37.289 --> 37:38.956
I cannot believe it.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.624
You actually invented something
worse than the u-dog.

37:40.626 --> 37:43.693
Mine fits fine.
I feel dizzy.
Nope.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.697
It's just a prototype.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.401
But I want... I want you to know

37:51.403 --> 37:54.504
that I care about
your family, Toby.

37:54.506 --> 37:57.374
And I'm sorry that I held back

37:57.376 --> 37:59.876
on getting my citizenship papers
expedited.

37:59.878 --> 38:03.513
It's okay.
That's a sticky situation.

38:10.422 --> 38:13.690
Zero out of ten doctors
think that is a good idea.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.592
You know what
is a good idea?

38:15.594 --> 38:18.662
Me stopping being such a
pip about your pregnancy.

38:18.664 --> 38:21.531
It's a you-terus,
not a me-terus.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.533
Don't say "me-terus" again.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.302
Done. See?

38:25.304 --> 38:27.404
I'm here to give you
what you want

38:27.406 --> 38:28.505
during your pregnancy.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.073
So, my fruit-bearing beauty,

38:30.075 --> 38:31.608
my expecting engineer,

38:31.610 --> 38:34.010
my romantic mainstay
who's in the family way,

38:34.012 --> 38:37.547
I have just one more
question for you.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.716
What do you need?

38:39.718 --> 38:41.818
Remember that
strawberry-rhubarb pie

38:41.820 --> 38:43.887
I had at that roadside stand
last month?

38:43.889 --> 38:46.022
A craving, just like
Paige's salty-sweet thing.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.692
This I can do for you.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.928
That stand's, like,
43 miles away.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.997
Roger that. One pie coming up.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.902
You don't really
want that pie, do you?

38:58.904 --> 39:02.372
No. I want two hours of quiet.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.075
Help you?

39:05.077 --> 39:06.743
I am looking
for Walter o'brien.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.945
Who's asking?
Mr. o'brien?

39:09.815 --> 39:11.014
Mrs. Quinn.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.983
Joyce linehan. I'm with U.S.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.653
Citizenship and immigration,
and I am going to be handling

39:16.655 --> 39:18.121
your case.
Walter:
Nice to meet you.

39:18.123 --> 39:21.124
The wife and I appreciate
such a quick turnaround

39:21.126 --> 39:22.659
on our expedited request.

39:22.661 --> 39:24.661
Don't we... honey?
We sure do... babe.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.696
Just didn't think it
would be this fast.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.766
You can thank your role with
homeland for the green light.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.134
But you know
what's funny.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.002
I looked into your history,

39:33.004 --> 39:34.771
and I found some things
that are curious.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.506
Well, you know, when
you're dealing with geniuses,

39:36.508 --> 39:37.674
things get curious.
We're curious by nature.

39:37.676 --> 39:38.942
I'm not talking to you.

39:38.944 --> 39:39.943
Got it.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.711
Let me be blunt.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.747
You've had six years

39:43.749 --> 39:44.948
of different addresses,

39:44.950 --> 39:47.150
and normally, married people
live together,

39:47.152 --> 39:49.619
even in Los Angeles.

39:49.621 --> 39:52.989
So... I'm curious.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.858
Well, well,
I'm an engineer,

39:54.860 --> 39:57.427
uh, so I use
an apartment to store

39:57.429 --> 39:59.462
tools, spare parts,
that kind of stuff.

39:59.464 --> 40:01.831
Instead of a storage unit?

40:01.833 --> 40:04.000
I'm idiosyncratic.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.002
Guess so.
How about
some coffee?

40:06.004 --> 40:07.971
No, thank you.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.739
I just thought
I'd stop by and say hello

40:09.741 --> 40:11.841
since I'm gonna be in your life
for some time now.

40:11.843 --> 40:14.511
And we'll talk in
detail when I get back.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.146
Any idea when that will be?

40:16.148 --> 40:17.781
Yes.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.619
Cabe:
That's 138

40:22.621 --> 40:24.921
pounds of trouble in
a polyester pantsuit.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.689
Are you kidding me?!

40:26.691 --> 40:28.625
"The wife and i"? "Babe"?!

40:28.627 --> 40:29.759
You guys
suck at this!

40:29.761 --> 40:30.760
Yeah, that
was painful.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.996
You two need
to step it up!

40:32.998 --> 40:34.464
All of our
futures rest

40:34.466 --> 40:36.166
in that devil-woman's
bureaucratic mitts.

40:36.168 --> 40:38.768
If she detects your marriage
is a sham, game over.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.703
Walter's leaving on a jet plane,

40:40.705 --> 40:42.839
and Tobias merriweather Curtis's
mother is a felon.

40:42.841 --> 40:45.708
Guys, relationships are living,
breathing things.

40:45.710 --> 40:46.810
No, they're not.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.712
I mean,
you got to know all the details,

40:48.713 --> 40:50.613
all the things couples know
from spending years together.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.081
Intimacies, quirks, habits.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.650
Toby:
She's right.

40:53.652 --> 40:54.951
Who snores? Who
hogs the covers?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.986
Who rolls up the bottom
of the toothpaste tube?

40:56.988 --> 40:58.154
This isn't stuff
you memorize.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.556
This is learned
behavior.

40:59.558 --> 41:02.158
You can only learn it
if you've lived it!

41:02.160 --> 41:04.928
Well, you're the behaviorist,
so what do we do?

41:07.966 --> 41:10.033
Oh. Cabe, uh,

41:10.035 --> 41:12.869
you need a place to crash
for a couple weeks, right?

41:14.573 --> 41:17.140
As of now,
Happy's apartment has a vacancy.

41:19.811 --> 41:23.546
We said we'd do
what it takes?

41:23.548 --> 41:26.115
Right. Whatever it takes.

41:26.117 --> 41:28.585
Toby:
Yup.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.653
Whatever it takes.
