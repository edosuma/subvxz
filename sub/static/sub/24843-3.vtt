00:11.833 --> 00:13.433
[theme music playing]

00:31.433 --> 00:33.067
[breathing heavily]

00:51.100 --> 00:54.800
-Ah, God. I can't.
-Come on, old man.

00:54.833 --> 00:59.567
Mate...
I'm out of condition.

00:59.600 --> 01:04.067
I'm saying nothing.
Just the last time we did this,

01:04.100 --> 01:06.233
I was actually sick
trying to keep up with you.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.400
Nape's Needle,
we never climbed that, did we?

01:11.433 --> 01:13.467
Still got all the gear
in the shed.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.500
Alright, when we get back,

01:15.533 --> 01:18.100
I'm gonna put a date
in the diary.

01:18.133 --> 01:19.500
Oh?

01:19.533 --> 01:21.367
-Deal?
-Deal.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.467
-Good. Last one to the top
buys the beers.
-No!

01:24.500 --> 01:25.633
Come on!

01:29.367 --> 01:30.700
[Phil grunts]

01:30.733 --> 01:32.333
Where are you?

01:57.567 --> 01:59.400
[birds chirping]

02:01.767 --> 02:03.233
[indistinct chattering]

02:03.267 --> 02:04.500
[women laughing]

02:04.533 --> 02:05.733
[Phil] Cheers.

02:08.700 --> 02:10.733
[indistinct chattering
continues]

02:10.767 --> 02:11.767
Here.

02:14.400 --> 02:19.167
Thanks. I wouldn't normally
take it, but, um...

02:19.200 --> 02:22.033
What?

02:22.067 --> 02:24.667
-No, it's fine.
-What?

02:24.700 --> 02:28.033
I got laid off yesterday.

02:28.067 --> 02:30.233
-You're joking.
-[sighs]

02:30.267 --> 02:32.767
-Why?
-I don't know, really.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.300
Orders are right down,
they're cutting back, and...

02:35.333 --> 02:37.667
last in, first out, I guess.

02:37.700 --> 02:38.800
[David sighs]

02:41.767 --> 02:44.133
I'm sure it's got
nothing to do with you.

02:44.167 --> 02:47.667
Right. Okay.
My solicitor rang yesterday.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.833
Apparently, one of the tabloids
is still sniffing around.

02:50.867 --> 02:55.600
-Dave, I really don't--
-I need the money, Phil.

02:55.633 --> 02:59.700
I need the money
to fight the case.

02:59.733 --> 03:02.600
To buy the kids the basics,
to live.

03:02.633 --> 03:07.100
The chances of me
getting a job round here, zero.

03:07.133 --> 03:08.767
And you've worked yourself
to the bone, for me.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.600
-Oh, no, no--
-I'm gonna make good.

03:17.233 --> 03:18.800
I'm gonna meet the guy.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.467
[clanking]

03:23.500 --> 03:26.033
-The truth is, David's right.
-No.

03:26.067 --> 03:30.200
Yeah. We can't stop Jack
going there. He's a teenage boy.

03:30.233 --> 03:33.300
The more we try,
the more he'll resist us.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.733
I also think we've got
more important things
to worry about.

03:35.767 --> 03:39.767
What, more important than
keeping our family together?

03:39.800 --> 03:43.033
I think we need
to get you a lawyer.

03:43.067 --> 03:46.100
What, so you think
I need help, do you?
To cover my tracks?

03:46.133 --> 03:48.800
No, I don't need a lawyer, Rob,
because I have done
nothing wrong.

03:48.833 --> 03:51.100
So I'm gonna do the interview,
I'm gonna tell the truth,

03:51.133 --> 03:53.200
and then I'm gonna get on
with being a parent.

04:22.567 --> 04:25.600
Hi, guys. You seen D.I. Hudson
around anywhere?

04:25.633 --> 04:28.767
-[Mari Luz] I think
she's in with Hillman.
-Thanks.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.633
[phone ringing]

04:45.767 --> 04:48.167
[car horn honking]

04:48.200 --> 04:49.767
[Tom exhales]

05:07.367 --> 05:10.567
[indistinct chattering]

05:10.600 --> 05:14.667
[Alice] So Jack's 16
in a few weeks, Ro.

05:14.700 --> 05:18.633
He's almost taller than Rob.
He can look after himself,
can't he?

05:18.667 --> 05:21.667
But you can't, Ro,

05:21.700 --> 05:25.467
so I really need you
to listen to me here, please.

05:28.500 --> 05:34.067
Three juries have failed
to find your father not guilty.

05:34.100 --> 05:38.100
Thirty-six men and women
have listened to the evidence,

05:38.133 --> 05:41.333
in three trials
over seven years,

05:41.367 --> 05:44.067
and not one of them, darling,

05:44.100 --> 05:45.633
not one of them,

05:45.667 --> 05:49.333
have been able to say
the words "not guilty".

05:52.367 --> 05:56.200
And as much
as I really understand
your confusion right now,

05:56.233 --> 05:59.600
I really do, that scares me.

05:59.633 --> 06:02.833
It really does.

06:02.867 --> 06:06.133
And I think it should
scare you, too, sweetheart.

06:11.333 --> 06:14.833
If it were one or two
genuine mistakes, perhaps
we could find a way round it.

06:14.867 --> 06:17.600
-[Will] Sir--
-But this is way more than that.

06:17.633 --> 06:19.833
In fact, the evidence brought
to me by D.I. Hudson

06:19.867 --> 06:23.200
strongly suggests
your initial investigation
wasn't just flawed,

06:23.233 --> 06:25.067
but also perhaps
criminally negligent.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.367
-With respect, sir--
-You will have the opportunity

06:27.400 --> 06:30.433
to answer the allegations
made against you in due course,
D.C.I. Beech,

06:30.467 --> 06:33.733
but right now,
I'm informing you that I'm
suspending you from duties,

06:33.767 --> 06:37.633
and I've forwarded the details
regarding this allegation
to Professional Standards.

06:37.667 --> 06:41.167
The evidence against Collins
remains, and I have no doubt,
in time--

06:41.200 --> 06:43.200
I expect them to serve you
with a Reg-15 notice.

06:43.233 --> 06:45.067
You will then have ten days
to respond in writing

06:45.100 --> 06:47.333
to the allegations
made against you.

06:47.367 --> 06:50.333
The right to consult
a federation representative...
[fading]

06:55.200 --> 06:57.433
[David] It's to go nowhere
near my kids. Okay?

06:57.467 --> 07:01.633
Which we wouldn't anyway.
We know what
they've been through.

07:01.667 --> 07:04.333
And actually, what some readers
are mainly interested in
is your story.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.667
What you've been through,
how you're moving forward.

07:08.467 --> 07:10.600
And how long would this
go on for?

07:10.633 --> 07:12.567
We think three Saturdays.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.233
We always do a weekend
person interest story,

07:14.267 --> 07:16.633
and we're thinking
[inhales] prison years,

07:16.667 --> 07:19.300
the retrial and release,
and then the future.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.233
These true-life crime stories
play very well now

07:21.267 --> 07:22.733
with all the stuff on telly
coming over from America.

07:22.767 --> 07:26.400
For all of this,
how much would you pay me?

07:26.433 --> 07:29.667
I've been authorised
to offer you
10,000 pounds, David.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.833
-I was hoping
for more than that.
-Hmm.

07:36.867 --> 07:40.100
I need more than that.

07:40.133 --> 07:42.300
Maybe if we'd done it
immediately after
the trial collapsed,

07:42.333 --> 07:45.767
-but that's the best I can do,
I'm afraid.
-Would you go to 15?

07:45.800 --> 07:47.167
I'm really sorry.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.567
Thirteen, then?

07:54.567 --> 07:55.700
Please.

07:57.633 --> 07:59.533
I've got lawyer's fees,
I owe my brother money

07:59.567 --> 08:02.400
and I need to buy
the kids stuff.

08:02.433 --> 08:04.700
Please.

08:04.733 --> 08:09.467
I can go to 12,
if we start right now, here.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.733
See if we can get it in
for this weekend.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.633
For 12?

08:16.667 --> 08:18.100
Okay.

08:19.667 --> 08:24.067
I'm gonna need
a couple of signatures...

08:28.867 --> 08:31.667
[Rosie] She's still scared
of him, you know.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.333
Mum.

08:33.367 --> 08:34.700
Alice.

08:37.633 --> 08:41.200
I heard her and Rob rowing
the other night.

08:41.233 --> 08:42.800
The police were asking questions
about where she was

08:42.833 --> 08:45.800
-the night Mum died.
-No.

08:45.833 --> 08:48.600
They've spoken to her once
already, and now she has
to go back in again.

08:48.633 --> 08:52.467
-What do they think?
-I don't know.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.133
But Rob
is really freaked out by it.

08:55.167 --> 08:57.800
-They don't think she--
-I don't know,

08:57.833 --> 09:00.767
and, Ro, I wasn't gonna
say anything. It's just--

09:00.800 --> 09:03.133
If she's telling you shit
like she's scared of our dad

09:03.167 --> 09:05.367
and trying to come
between you and me...

09:07.367 --> 09:12.000
Right now, I trust him
a lot more than I trust her.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.633
[waves crashing]

09:44.733 --> 09:47.267
-[door buzzes]
-Thanks for this, mate.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.733
I shouldn't be more
than ten minutes, okay?

10:05.400 --> 10:06.800
[Alice]
Did you say anything?

10:06.833 --> 10:08.600
[Rob] What could I say?

10:11.067 --> 10:12.367
[Rob grunts]

10:18.267 --> 10:19.300
Do you trust me?

10:22.733 --> 10:24.133
Of course.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.300
I need to ask a possibly
a difficult question
for you to answer.

10:36.333 --> 10:39.800
But I wanna qualify it
by saying that any investigation

10:39.833 --> 10:41.700
is as much
about eliminating possibilities

10:41.733 --> 10:43.667
-as it is about finding them,
okay?
-Right.

10:45.600 --> 10:50.600
Did your wife ever express
any concerns about her sister?

10:50.633 --> 10:53.533
What sort of concerns?

10:53.567 --> 10:57.533
Did she ever say
anything to suggest
that she was scared of her?

10:57.567 --> 11:00.233
Physically scared of her?

11:00.267 --> 11:02.733
-Are you being serious?
-Did she?

11:07.600 --> 11:12.300
[sighs] As much
as I would love to say yes...

11:12.333 --> 11:14.267
no.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.833
They had a fiery relationship,
but they were sisters.

11:16.867 --> 11:18.667
But I never got any sense

11:18.700 --> 11:21.600
that she thought that Alice
would actually hurt her.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.300
Okay.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.700
Why? Why do you ask?
What have you found out?

11:24.733 --> 11:26.533
I can't disclose
any more information

11:26.567 --> 11:28.200
-at this time.
-Hey, no, no, no.

11:28.233 --> 11:29.600
She has my children.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.433
Yeah, I know,
I understand that,

11:31.467 --> 11:34.467
but I've told you
everything I can at this stage.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.600
-Thank you very much.
-Do you have any kids, Cathy?

11:38.633 --> 11:41.733
[sighs]

11:41.767 --> 11:44.600
-One.
-Boy or a girl?

11:44.633 --> 11:46.200
-A boy.
-Right.
And if you ever found out

11:46.233 --> 11:49.033
that he was in
any kind of danger,

11:49.067 --> 11:51.167
then you would have to know,
wouldn't you?

11:51.200 --> 11:53.167
Wouldn't you?
You'd have to know. So...

11:56.400 --> 12:01.167
I think Alice has
brought them up very well
for seven years,

12:01.200 --> 12:03.767
and I am sure
that they're completely safe.

12:09.767 --> 12:11.233
I'll be in touch.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.200
[Cathy] I've asked Alice Moffatt
for a minute-by-minute timeline
of where she was

12:22.233 --> 12:26.167
from leaving Tara at 9:55,
to approximately 8:00
the next morning.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.033
And, Graham, can you do
a full sweep on her?

12:28.067 --> 12:30.533
See if she had
any previous history,

12:30.567 --> 12:34.167
-cautions, bind overs, parking
tickets, anything at all.
-Yup.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.233
Are we seriously now suggesting
she's a possible suspect?

12:37.267 --> 12:40.633
She was jealous
of what her sister had,
the career, the kids.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.733
And she owed her
nearly 20,000 pounds,
which she couldn't pay back.

12:43.767 --> 12:48.400
Yes, she's a suspect.
As indeed is Tom Wilson.

12:48.433 --> 12:51.567
He's now confessed to being
in a troubled relationship
with Tara,

12:51.600 --> 12:54.100
and we know that on more
than one occasion, they fought.

12:54.133 --> 12:58.367
The question is,
did it ever spill over
into anything more?

12:58.400 --> 13:00.167
Steve, let's go back over
his movements that night,

13:00.200 --> 13:02.367
look through
the original CCTV footage,

13:02.400 --> 13:05.600
-and all the original
witness statements, please?
-[Beckton] Guv.

13:05.633 --> 13:08.500
And then lastly,
David Collins.

13:08.533 --> 13:10.300
The most damning evidence
against him

13:10.333 --> 13:13.667
has always been
his wife's blood on his coat.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.667
His defence
convinced the jury
that cross-contamination

13:15.700 --> 13:17.333
was a possible reason.

13:17.367 --> 13:20.033
Was it a likely one?

13:20.067 --> 13:22.667
[sighs] Mari Luz,
you speak to the lab again.

13:22.700 --> 13:27.500
-Okay, that's it. Thanks, guys.
-What happened
with D.C.I. Beech, Guv?

13:27.533 --> 13:31.067
We heard he got served
with a Reg-15 yesterday.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.067
Um, Reg-15s are signed off
by the head of PSU.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.733
I don't know anything
about that,

13:35.767 --> 13:39.700
but I was asked to give
an update on the investigation,

13:39.733 --> 13:41.300
how it's moved on.

13:41.333 --> 13:42.633
Which I did.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.567
The idiot actually
got nailed for destroying
government property,

13:53.600 --> 13:56.667
because he shredded everything
when he knew SMU were onto him.

13:56.700 --> 13:59.200
And how compromised
were his methods?

13:59.233 --> 14:01.433
How about
very fucking compromised?

14:01.467 --> 14:03.533
So, what was he actually doing?
Or not doing?

14:03.567 --> 14:05.600
[sighs] Everything.

14:05.633 --> 14:07.433
Buying cheap materials,

14:07.467 --> 14:08.800
invoicing
for government standard

14:08.833 --> 14:10.600
and pocketing the difference,

14:10.633 --> 14:13.100
re-using
disposable Petri dishes.

14:13.133 --> 14:15.800
His cleaning and log protocols
were totally chaotic.

14:15.833 --> 14:17.800
And he really did
shred everything?

14:17.833 --> 14:20.333
We have no records
I can look at, at all?

14:20.367 --> 14:23.433
-Why else do you think
Collins got off?
-Okay.

14:23.467 --> 14:26.433
So, his coat,
run it through testing again.

14:26.467 --> 14:29.567
Have you got any idea
how many times
that coat's been looked at?

14:29.600 --> 14:31.433
I want it done again.

14:31.467 --> 14:33.500
The blood was clearly
in a spatter pattern.

14:33.533 --> 14:35.200
That was never
cross-contamination.

14:35.233 --> 14:38.067
ASAP.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.667
-Please.
-So, what else am I looking for?

14:40.700 --> 14:44.367
Everything. Hair, sweat, skin,
fibres, foreign debris.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.100
Anything. Everything.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.700
[machine beeping]

14:49.733 --> 14:53.533
I told the original officer
all that. Nothing's changed.

14:53.567 --> 14:56.333
So, you got home
at about 10:15,

14:56.367 --> 14:59.100
you had a cup of tea,
and went to bed at about 11,

14:59.133 --> 15:03.700
and then you woke at about 9,
just before getting the bus
to work,

15:03.733 --> 15:06.067
arriving slightly late
at just after 10.

15:06.100 --> 15:10.367
-Yes.
-And we have a record of one
last call to Tara's mobile,

15:10.400 --> 15:14.833
-this one at 10:27
from your landline.
-Yes.

15:14.867 --> 15:17.167
-Which she didn't answer.
-No.

15:17.200 --> 15:21.500
-And you didn't leave a message?
-I went through all this
seven years ago.

15:21.533 --> 15:23.400
This call suggests
you couldn't have been anywhere

15:23.433 --> 15:26.800
-near Halesham at that time.
-No.

15:26.833 --> 15:29.500
-Rob was at home
when you got back?
-Yes.

15:29.533 --> 15:33.267
-And he'll corroborate
these timings?
-Yes.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.433
Can you tell me, then,
why your car was clocked
by a speed camera

15:36.467 --> 15:39.700
doing 57 miles an hour
in a 30-mile an hour zone,

15:39.733 --> 15:42.833
halfway between your house
and Tara's, at 10:26 that night?

15:42.867 --> 15:46.333
-What?
-We've just learned
that your car was photographed

15:46.367 --> 15:50.600
speeding at 10:26
on the B3307.

15:50.633 --> 15:54.367
Well, I don't know.
I don't-- I don't know.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.233
Could it have been you driving?

15:56.267 --> 15:58.433
No, I'd been drinking,
I don't-- No, it wasn't me.

15:58.467 --> 16:00.767
Did anyone,
apart from your husband,
have access to your car?

16:00.800 --> 16:02.667
No.

16:02.700 --> 16:06.300
-Did you report it stolen?
-No.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.067
So, it must have been Rob?

16:11.733 --> 16:14.133
Well, I don't know.

16:14.167 --> 16:16.700
Except you said
in your original statement,

16:16.733 --> 16:19.600
and just now to us,
that he was with you all night.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.367
Could he have taken the car
without you realising?

16:30.467 --> 16:34.267
I suppose it's possible.

16:34.300 --> 16:37.833
And can I ask, then, if
when you came in, you told him
about the row you'd had?

16:37.867 --> 16:41.100
I don't remember specifically.
It was seven years ago.

16:44.433 --> 16:45.567
But I...

16:48.067 --> 16:50.800
I imagine
I would have done, yes.

16:50.833 --> 16:53.767
And, obviously,
he knew about the money
you'd borrowed from her

16:53.800 --> 16:55.833
-and not yet paid back.
-Yes.

16:55.867 --> 17:00.267
-What time did you say
you woke again, sorry?
-About 9.

17:00.300 --> 17:03.033
-And was he in the house then?
-Yes. Definitely.

17:06.133 --> 17:08.433
Are you sure, Alice?

17:08.467 --> 17:10.367
You've already given us
several very different accounts

17:10.400 --> 17:12.167
of your movements that night.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.600
Yeah, he was there.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.733
He was there, I promise.

17:22.433 --> 17:24.500
[birds chirping]

17:34.733 --> 17:36.500
[waves crashing]

17:41.700 --> 17:44.167
It... It's all here.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.167
It's all in good nick as well.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.600
Oh, Dave, no, no.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.400
That's a fraction
of what I owe you.

17:51.433 --> 17:54.067
So, please, come on,
it makes me feel better.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.367
Alright? For me.

17:56.400 --> 18:00.567
-Didn't take long, did it?
-What didn't?

18:00.600 --> 18:03.733
Me, taking handouts from you.

18:03.767 --> 18:07.233
-[sighs]
-Normal service, eh?

18:07.267 --> 18:09.333
Where you off to?

18:09.367 --> 18:12.100
To give my lawyer money,
and then to tell him that Alice

18:12.133 --> 18:14.800
is now a suspect.

18:14.833 --> 18:17.467
Yeah. Should make things
interesting, eh?

18:19.333 --> 18:22.733
[Tom] And no one wants
to charge me of anything,

18:22.767 --> 18:28.133
no one's accusing me
of anything,
I'm not being re-interviewed.

18:28.167 --> 18:31.067
I made a terrible mistake
having an affair with Tara.

18:31.100 --> 18:36.700
And I'll never stop
feeling shitty about what
my selfishness cost my kids.

18:36.733 --> 18:40.200
But that was
eight years ago, Mel.

18:40.233 --> 18:43.533
And that's not who I am now.

18:43.567 --> 18:48.367
So, please, come back home
and let me prove I can be
a better father to our child.

18:50.067 --> 18:51.333
Please.

18:54.167 --> 18:57.133
[Beckton] Well, according
to my notes, you were flagged
from a door-to-door,

18:57.167 --> 19:00.100
as having possible information,
but it was never followed up?

19:00.133 --> 19:02.533
[man] Not me,
it was my wife they spoke to.

19:02.567 --> 19:05.533
Right, um...

19:05.567 --> 19:09.467
Well, it looks like we've got
Mr. Adebayo here, sorry. Um...

19:09.500 --> 19:13.133
-Remember what information
it was she had?
-She saw someone that night,

19:13.167 --> 19:15.833
walking away from the direction
of Collins' house.

19:15.867 --> 19:18.633
We only live a hundred yards
or so from them.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.600
Right.
Uh, is your wife around?

19:22.633 --> 19:25.600
She's at work, but I can
get her to call you later.

19:25.633 --> 19:29.100
Yeah, that would be great.
Let me give you my direct line.

19:34.267 --> 19:37.233
-[cell phone ringing]
-It's all there.

19:37.267 --> 19:41.400
So, which do you want me
to concentrate on?
The house or the kids?

19:41.433 --> 19:45.800
The kids, obviously,
because I'd defy any court
in the world

19:45.833 --> 19:48.100
to think they're safer
with them now than with me.

19:48.133 --> 19:51.367
-Okay.
-Right.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.133
And then when we do get
the kids, which we will,

19:53.167 --> 19:55.367
I want you to go
after their house.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.533
I'm practically homeless.
Let's see how
they fucking like it.

20:11.133 --> 20:13.600
[Phil] No worries.
Yeah, see you then.

20:15.700 --> 20:18.800
He's really sorry, mate,
but he's not gonna be back
for a while.

20:18.833 --> 20:22.267
-He's had to go into town
short notice.
-Why?

20:22.300 --> 20:27.233
Uh, following up on some
work possibilities, I think.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.033
-Right.
-I mean, you're very welcome
to wait.

20:30.067 --> 20:33.033
It's fine.
I'll come back tomorrow.

20:39.767 --> 20:42.300
-I used to see you, you know.
-Oh.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.267
When you used to watch us
in the park.

20:44.300 --> 20:48.433
And there was me thinking
I had a future in special ops.

20:48.467 --> 20:52.533
I always wanted to come visit
after you moved down.

20:52.567 --> 20:55.767
It felt unfair that you got
caught up in everything.

20:55.800 --> 21:01.600
But Mum, Alice, thought that
it would be confusing for us.

21:01.633 --> 21:06.633
I'm sure she didn't make
the decision lightly.

21:06.667 --> 21:09.133
Look. [sighs]

21:09.167 --> 21:15.033
I know things got really messy
after your mum died,

21:15.067 --> 21:18.033
but I think Alice
is basically a good person.

21:19.467 --> 21:21.667
Don't you?

21:21.700 --> 21:24.367
-Whatever happened
to Auntie Gemma?
-[chuckles]

21:24.400 --> 21:26.733
When you guys
were down from Bolton,
you used to babysit us.

21:26.767 --> 21:28.600
Bring us donuts.

21:28.633 --> 21:31.567
-We liked Auntie Gem.
-[chuckles]

21:31.600 --> 21:35.133
Yeah, she went back to live
with her folks in Burnley.

21:35.167 --> 21:36.833
Why?

21:36.867 --> 21:40.433
Oh, you know, it was--
it was hard after the trial.

21:43.833 --> 21:45.333
It was hard for everyone.

22:00.633 --> 22:05.233
-How could you have done that?
-Jesus, Will.

22:05.267 --> 22:07.567
How could you actually
have gone to Hillman?

22:07.600 --> 22:10.400
-You shouldn't be here.
-How could you do that to me?

22:10.433 --> 22:14.667
I didn't do anything to you,
you did it to yourself.

22:14.700 --> 22:19.400
You ignored evidence, you failed
to make a full disclosure
and you lied, Will.

22:19.433 --> 22:20.800
I loved you so much.

22:20.833 --> 22:23.300
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you loved me so much

22:23.333 --> 22:24.700
that you did everything
you could

22:24.733 --> 22:27.100
to manipulate me
into protecting you.

22:29.133 --> 22:31.600
And I loved you.
And Jacob loved you.

22:31.633 --> 22:33.667
And you betrayed us both.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.400
-So that's what this is?
Revenge?
-No, it isn't,

22:36.433 --> 22:38.667
because unlike you,
I don't let my personal life
interfere with my work.

22:38.700 --> 22:42.700
-Oh, yeah? Listen.
-Fuck, Will.

22:42.733 --> 22:44.633
You're drunk. Go home
and don't come here again.

22:44.667 --> 22:47.333
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22:47.367 --> 22:51.367
I just-- I just want
to show you this.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.800
I'm guessing
you've not found it yet.

22:52.833 --> 22:55.300
It was only introduced
pre-sentencing.

22:56.733 --> 22:59.433
The truth, Cath.

23:01.633 --> 23:04.233
My methods may leave
a little bit to be desired,
but the truth,

23:04.267 --> 23:08.467
I've always had a nose
for the truth,
and I think you know that.

23:08.500 --> 23:12.467
And deep down, I think
you still know it was Collins.

23:18.167 --> 23:19.533
[sighs]

24:06.767 --> 24:09.100
[Cathy]
David Collins' girlfriend
never pressed charges,

24:09.133 --> 24:10.500
and the caution's
long since spent.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.033
How long were they together?

24:12.067 --> 24:14.600
Two years.
Proper relationship.

24:14.633 --> 24:16.767
-Jesus.
-Yeah.

24:16.800 --> 24:21.267
So, I want us to try
and track her down,
get her side of things.

24:21.300 --> 24:25.167
'Cause, uh,
if Collins did do that,

24:25.200 --> 24:27.100
that's a history
of domestic violence.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.367
And that is not good.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.100
[Rob] Hang on a minute.
Am I under arrest?

24:36.133 --> 24:38.767
[Cathy] No, not at the moment.
This would be
a voluntary interview

24:38.800 --> 24:41.767
relating to questions we have
following our interview
with your wife.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.233
-But I am gonna caution you.
-What have you said, luv?

24:44.267 --> 24:46.500
-I haven't said anything,
sweetheart, I swear.
-[Cathy] And tell you

24:46.533 --> 24:48.100
that you don't have
to say anything, but it may
harm your defence

24:48.133 --> 24:49.733
if you do not mention
my questions

24:49.767 --> 24:51.733
as something which you later
rely on in court.

24:51.767 --> 24:54.767
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence. Okay?

24:58.833 --> 25:01.533
I don't want to do this here.
Can we do it at the station,
please?

25:01.567 --> 25:04.333
Of course. After you.

25:08.567 --> 25:11.667
Rosie. Rosie.

25:15.233 --> 25:17.733
-Rosie.
-What's happening?

25:17.767 --> 25:19.533
Nothing, darling,
everything's fine.

25:19.567 --> 25:21.367
Did Dad--

25:21.400 --> 25:24.467
-Did Rob do something wrong?
-Dad did nothing wrong.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.333
-Why are they taking him, then?
-They just want to ask him
a few questions, darling.

25:27.367 --> 25:29.533
-It's really fine.
-Some questions like what?

25:29.567 --> 25:33.500
Please, Rosie, I'm really tired
and stressed. Can you just...?

25:33.533 --> 25:36.167
-Did you?
-Did I what?

25:36.200 --> 25:40.700
-Did you do something bad?
-Something bad like what?

25:40.733 --> 25:44.433
-Did you hurt my mother?
-No, I did not hurt
your sainted mother!

25:44.467 --> 25:48.833
But, my God, she hurt me
every day of her life!
Rosie, Rosie, please!

25:48.867 --> 25:53.267
-No! No!
-Rosie, please!
Sorry, sorry, Rosie, please!

25:53.300 --> 25:55.267
-Leave me alone!
-[screams]

26:00.433 --> 26:02.333
-[sobs]
-[door closing]

26:17.233 --> 26:19.567
Yes, it was me
driving the car.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.800
Okay, where were you heading?

26:21.833 --> 26:24.500
Uh, I was looking
for a late night chemist.

26:24.533 --> 26:26.467
There's one in Exminster.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.333
Okay. For what?

26:29.367 --> 26:32.733
Alice had been on, uh,
anti-depressants for some time,

26:32.767 --> 26:35.167
since the IVF problems
we'd had.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.267
And, um, she'd run out
a few days before.

26:38.300 --> 26:40.433
She had a new prescription
but she hadn't picked it up.

26:42.333 --> 26:46.333
And then when she got back
that night, she was crying,

26:46.367 --> 26:51.267
uh, upset, she was very low,
and I decided to see if I could
pick up her medication.

26:51.300 --> 26:54.333
-At 10:30 at night?
-Yes.

26:54.367 --> 26:56.700
So, what difference
would it have made
going in the morning?

26:56.733 --> 26:59.600
Anti-depressants can take weeks
to get into your system.

26:59.633 --> 27:04.067
Yeah, I know.
But I wanted to get out as well.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.333
We'd, uh...

27:06.367 --> 27:09.667
We'd rowed,
and I wanted some time to think.

27:09.700 --> 27:13.267
Rowed about what?

27:13.300 --> 27:15.567
Tara.

27:15.600 --> 27:19.067
How to deal
with her behaviour.

27:19.100 --> 27:24.300
I wanted to cut her off
for good, but Alice would
never contemplate that.

27:26.233 --> 27:29.733
Would it be fair to say
that you didn't like Tara?

27:29.767 --> 27:34.600
No, it wouldn't be fair
to say that at all.

27:34.633 --> 27:41.233
It would be fair to say
that I hated her, for the pain
she caused my wife.

27:41.267 --> 27:44.200
-Did you get the prescription?
-No.

27:44.233 --> 27:47.233
No, the chemist closed at 11.
I got there about 5 past.

27:47.267 --> 27:50.600
-That would have been
why I was speeding.
-Right.

27:50.633 --> 27:53.733
I don't have a map
in front of me, obviously,
but am I right in thinking

27:53.767 --> 27:56.433
that to get from where you were
then living, to Exminster,

27:56.467 --> 27:58.500
you would have had to pass
through Halesham?

27:58.533 --> 28:02.200
-Yes.
-And the camera
snapped you in Slinfield.

28:02.233 --> 28:04.833
How many miles is that
before Halesham, would you say?

28:04.867 --> 28:07.433
-About two or three?
-Yeah, about that.

28:07.467 --> 28:11.400
So, Tara's train gets in
at 10:35.

28:11.433 --> 28:16.633
A few minutes to get off
the platform, down onto
the road, let's say 10:40.

28:16.667 --> 28:19.033
Would you say that was
about the time you were
passing through?

28:19.067 --> 28:20.533
Yes.

28:20.567 --> 28:23.300
Did you see her?

28:23.333 --> 28:27.500
Sadly not. Otherwise,
she might still be alive.

28:27.533 --> 28:29.433
You're absolutely certain?

28:29.467 --> 28:32.633
Absolutely.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.633
-You work at a boatyard,
don't you?
-Yes.

28:34.667 --> 28:36.533
What do you do there,
specifically?

28:36.567 --> 28:38.600
Uh, anything and everything.

28:38.633 --> 28:42.133
-You work with ropes?
-Yeah, sometimes.

28:42.167 --> 28:47.433
-Do you know
what a butterfly knot is?
-Yeah, of course.

28:47.467 --> 28:50.467
Okay. Thank you so much
for your time.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.767
[cell phone rings]

29:01.167 --> 29:03.033
Andy, how's tricks?

29:03.067 --> 29:05.267
-[Andy] Yeah, all good, you?
-Yeah, I can't complain.

29:05.300 --> 29:08.533
Listen, mate. I'm gonna cut
straight to the chase.

29:08.567 --> 29:10.700
You know I'm doing
a couple of days a week
at the Farmbrook Clinic.

29:10.733 --> 29:15.333
-Yeah, yeah.
-So, you never heard this
from me, but...

29:15.367 --> 29:19.100
I've just seen Melissa
in reception.

29:19.133 --> 29:20.833
Stop her, Andy.

29:20.867 --> 29:22.800
I'm on my way.
Just-- Just stop her.

29:29.433 --> 29:34.033
Guv? I've just spoken
to an old witness
that was never followed up.

29:34.067 --> 29:37.367
-Yeah?
-She lives on the same road
as the Collins,

29:37.400 --> 29:39.667
and on the night of the murder,
as she was arriving home,

29:39.700 --> 29:42.633
she saw Tom Wilson walking away
from the Collins' house.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.800
Right, yeah, we know this.

29:44.833 --> 29:47.767
No, no, it's not that.
It's the timing.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.033
She says it was definitely
around 11:30.

29:50.067 --> 29:52.100
-What makes her so sure?
-She was working at Anderson's,

29:52.133 --> 29:54.300
the meat packing place,
doing shift work.

29:54.333 --> 29:57.300
The late shift finishes at 11.
It took her ten minutes
to get out.

29:57.333 --> 29:59.767
-It's a 20-minute walk home.
-And she's absolutely certain
it was him?

29:59.800 --> 30:02.767
He was her obstetrician
for both her kids.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.667
-Pull Wilson in again, yeah?
-Yeah.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.367
I have told you
several times now, sir.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.300
I just want to speak to her.

30:10.333 --> 30:12.800
It's my child as well.

30:12.833 --> 30:14.533
She's my wife.

30:14.567 --> 30:16.533
I have a right to speak
to my own wife, don't I?

30:16.567 --> 30:19.100
Not if she doesn't wanna
speak to you, no.

30:19.133 --> 30:21.233
Now, please,
do yourself a favour

30:21.267 --> 30:24.367
and walk away,
or I will call the police.

30:24.400 --> 30:27.567
[laughs] F--

30:27.600 --> 30:29.733
Fine, fine, I'm going, fine.

30:31.567 --> 30:33.300
[grunts]

30:33.333 --> 30:35.267
-You twat.
-Ow!

31:00.567 --> 31:03.033
-[Jack] Hey.
-Hi.

31:03.067 --> 31:05.133
-What happened?
-Um...

31:05.167 --> 31:08.667
The police, they came
and took Dad away, and--

31:08.700 --> 31:13.700
And Mum started shouting at me,
and I-- I just had
to get out of there.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.800
Yeah. So, do you want
to go say hello?

31:21.733 --> 31:25.133
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

31:28.100 --> 31:30.767
Rosie, this is... Dad.

31:34.167 --> 31:35.533
Hello, Rosie.

31:37.700 --> 31:39.067
It's lovely to see you.

31:42.333 --> 31:46.133
You must be nervous.
I know I am.

31:46.167 --> 31:50.633
-I'm gonna get some drinks.
-Yeah, yeah,
that's a good idea. Um...

31:50.667 --> 31:52.333
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

31:54.767 --> 31:56.367
Shall we sit down?

32:00.867 --> 32:02.267
[David sniffles]

32:04.600 --> 32:05.667
Uh...

32:10.433 --> 32:12.567
[chuckles]

32:12.600 --> 32:16.100
I'm gonna say
a couple of things, Rosie,
and then...

32:18.467 --> 32:20.667
an then I'll shut up.
[chuckles]

32:23.767 --> 32:26.500
Okay. Firstly...

32:30.533 --> 32:33.567
I loved your mum so much.

32:33.600 --> 32:37.567
I would never have hurt
a hair on her head.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.567
[stutters]

32:39.600 --> 32:41.733
And, uh...

32:41.767 --> 32:44.067
I was just as devastated
as you were when she died.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.833
And secondly, I just--

32:52.867 --> 32:55.533
I just wanted to tell you,
in case you didn't know, that...

32:57.500 --> 33:00.733
[sniffles]
that not a single hour went by

33:00.767 --> 33:04.600
when I didn't think
about you and Jack.

33:08.133 --> 33:10.233
I missed you both so much.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.000
And I love you both
from the bottom of my heart.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.700
[sniffles]

33:19.733 --> 33:23.700
And whatever happens...
between us,

33:26.433 --> 33:30.200
I will always, always, love you.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.667
[sighs] I--

33:41.700 --> 33:45.567
I didn't think I'd remember
anything about you.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.200
But I do.

33:47.233 --> 33:50.233
What do you remember?

33:50.267 --> 33:52.533
Your smell.

33:52.567 --> 33:54.200
Soap and jumpers.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.733
[chuckles]

33:59.633 --> 34:02.167
Here we go.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.400
This is for you.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.800
-This is for you.
-[chuckles]

34:06.833 --> 34:09.667
Thank you.

34:09.700 --> 34:11.267
[indistinct chattering]

34:13.100 --> 34:15.733
Okay. Thanks so much
for your help.

34:18.133 --> 34:20.633
All right,
that was Collins' girlfriend.

34:20.667 --> 34:24.533
When they were students,
they were in a boozer,
both very drunk,

34:24.567 --> 34:28.467
and she swears blind
it was actually her
hitting Collins.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.733
-So, why did he get the caution?
-The arresting officer
didn't believe her,

34:31.767 --> 34:33.833
-thought she was scared of him.
-Right.

34:33.867 --> 34:35.733
And the officer told Collins

34:35.767 --> 34:39.100
that if didn't accept
the caution, he'd charge him.

34:39.133 --> 34:41.300
Okay. Good work.

34:43.367 --> 34:44.800
[sighs]

35:19.600 --> 35:22.400
Baz, have a look at this,
will you?

35:27.733 --> 35:33.300
[Tom] She told me the day before
that she was gonna
tell David about us...

35:34.867 --> 35:37.000
and then she was gonna
tell my wife.

35:40.433 --> 35:43.700
And that night, he invited me
around to play poker,

35:46.133 --> 35:48.167
and he was really weird
with me.

35:50.367 --> 35:51.800
Really odd.

35:54.533 --> 35:55.767
And I just...

35:57.467 --> 36:01.100
I thought that he must know,

36:03.400 --> 36:05.667
and that he was sort of
testing me.

36:09.367 --> 36:11.367
And then later that night...

36:16.067 --> 36:17.600
she was murdered.

36:20.433 --> 36:23.033
And, obviously,
he was a suspect.

36:28.267 --> 36:29.800
Except then, um...

36:31.333 --> 36:34.800
someone in town said
that they...

36:34.833 --> 36:37.800
that the milkman had, um...

36:37.833 --> 36:40.667
had seen him at 5:30.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.133
And I realised
he couldn't have done it.

36:46.167 --> 36:48.600
He couldn't have got her body
all the way out to Dedham

36:48.633 --> 36:52.667
and then got back again
by 5:30

36:52.700 --> 36:56.167
if I had been with him...

36:56.200 --> 36:58.100
until 11:30.

37:01.167 --> 37:03.200
So?

37:03.233 --> 37:04.267
[Tom] So...

37:06.133 --> 37:10.167
I changed my timing slightly,

37:10.200 --> 37:13.567
to keep him in custody.
[sobs]

37:13.600 --> 37:18.033
So that he wouldn't say anything
to my wife about me and Tara.

37:22.067 --> 37:25.367
[sniffles] Oh.

37:25.400 --> 37:28.167
I never thought
it would be that important.

37:28.200 --> 37:32.800
I never thought
that he could be convicted.

37:32.833 --> 37:35.767
I mean, I was just trying
to buy a little time.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.833
[sobs]

37:38.867 --> 37:40.833
And then... [sighs]

37:40.867 --> 37:45.200
And then the evidence came out
about the blood.

37:45.233 --> 37:47.700
And I thought,
"Okay, maybe he did do it".

37:47.733 --> 37:51.133
I mean, maybe he didn't go
all the way out to Dedham
that night,

37:51.167 --> 37:53.433
maybe he didn't put her there
until a few days later, but--

37:53.467 --> 37:57.833
He was being watched 24 hours
a day. You're a smart man.

37:57.867 --> 38:00.433
You'd have known that.

38:00.467 --> 38:01.500
I just...

38:06.233 --> 38:09.400
The longer it went on,

38:09.433 --> 38:11.567
the more scared I became.

38:18.667 --> 38:21.367
I couldn't find a way out.

38:23.400 --> 38:27.467
I'm sorry, I am truly.
I'm truly sorry.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.367
[sniffles]

38:29.400 --> 38:31.533
At that time,

38:31.567 --> 38:34.167
your house was on the other side
of the station, wasn't it?

38:37.867 --> 38:40.400
She got off the train
at 10:35.

38:40.433 --> 38:44.133
-I didn't go past the station
for at least an hour.
-Well, she was drunk.

38:44.167 --> 38:46.600
She might have
passed out somewhere.
She might have been sick.

38:46.633 --> 38:48.200
She might have met someone.
We don't know
what happened to her.

38:48.233 --> 38:50.067
I swear, I did not kill her.

38:50.100 --> 38:51.733
But we do know that she wasn't
at her house, don't we?

38:51.767 --> 38:53.567
Yeah, she wasn't at her house.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.700
And we do know you would clearly
have stopped at nothing

38:55.733 --> 38:57.800
to conceal your affair.

38:57.833 --> 38:59.633
I didn't kill her.

39:02.467 --> 39:05.233
Look, did you actually say
you thought it was me
who killed her?

39:05.267 --> 39:07.300
No, of course I didn't.

39:07.333 --> 39:09.400
They just asked me
who was driving the car,

39:09.433 --> 39:11.667
and I was shocked
because I didn't even know
you'd gone out.

39:11.700 --> 39:14.200
Because you were passed out.
A fairly regular occurrence

39:14.233 --> 39:16.633
-at that time.
-Why didn't you tell me
in the morning?

39:16.667 --> 39:18.800
-I don't know, I forgot.
-I didn't even need my pills
that night.

39:18.833 --> 39:21.433
-I thought you did, sorry.
-What else did you think
I needed, Rob?

39:21.467 --> 39:24.033
-What else did you think
you should do for me?
-What's that mean?

39:24.067 --> 39:26.033
-You tell me.
-I'm not the one
who attacked her.

39:26.067 --> 39:27.733
-I did not attack her!
-Listen, they told me

39:27.767 --> 39:29.733
some of the things you said
in your texts.

39:29.767 --> 39:32.833
-I was angry and drunk.
-Yeah?

39:32.867 --> 39:34.800
Well, they scared me,
and you know what?

39:34.833 --> 39:37.033
I don't blame the kids for
wanting to go back to their dad.

39:37.067 --> 39:39.200
He's a safer bet
than living here!

39:39.233 --> 39:42.467
You've just, more or less,
accused me of killing
your sister!

39:45.233 --> 39:48.700
[Mari Luz]
Okay, so sorry. Say again
what the flakes contained?

39:48.733 --> 39:54.400
Uh, dibutyl phthalate,
camphor and ferric ferrocyanide.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.500
How was this
not found before?

39:56.533 --> 40:00.067
Just more sophisticated tests
available now.

40:00.100 --> 40:03.133
And so, ferrocyanide.
I mean, what is that?

40:03.167 --> 40:05.267
-Sounds like some sort
of poison to me.
-No.

40:05.300 --> 40:08.333
No, not a poison.
None of them are poisons.

40:08.367 --> 40:11.567
They're just some
of the ingredients
of a very everyday compound.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.733
What we found
in both pockets of the coat

40:13.767 --> 40:17.600
are trace elements
of a woman's nail varnish.

40:19.733 --> 40:21.133
One second.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.567
-[Cathy] D.I. Hudson.
-Guv, it's me.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.100
Say all that again
to my guvnor.

40:36.167 --> 40:39.067
-[door opens]
-The time you and Tara fought,

40:39.100 --> 40:41.500
you said it was in an alley,
by the hospital?

40:41.533 --> 40:43.533
Well... [exhales]
Eh, yeah.

40:43.567 --> 40:45.033
Was this at night?

40:45.067 --> 40:47.033
-[sighs] Yeah.
-Late?

40:47.067 --> 40:49.767
-Um, after a shift, about 10?
-And this was February 12th?

40:49.800 --> 40:51.600
-If you say so.
-So it was cold?

40:51.633 --> 40:53.700
-I guess.
-Was it dry, raining, snowing?

40:53.733 --> 40:56.167
I don't know. It was seven
and a half years ago.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.667
What was she wearing?

40:59.367 --> 41:01.300
[exhales] It was, um...

41:03.133 --> 41:05.133
One of those, uh...

41:05.167 --> 41:08.100
A kind of parka [stammers]
with a fur-lined hood.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.700
She was kind of swamped
in it, like a...

41:16.400 --> 41:18.467
[Mari Luz] Great. Thanks.

41:20.500 --> 41:25.500
It was minus three
on February the 12th, 2009.

41:25.533 --> 41:27.500
So it's freezing cold,

41:27.533 --> 41:30.033
Tara can't find her coat,
or hers isn't warm enough,

41:30.067 --> 41:32.567
so she grabs her husband's
on the way out.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.433
I do it all the time.

41:34.467 --> 41:36.267
And that's why
her blood was on it.

41:36.300 --> 41:39.300
Not from her murder,
but from when Tom Wilson hit her

41:39.333 --> 41:41.667
three months before.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.800
She was wearing
David's coat.

42:02.867 --> 42:04.733
[knocking on door]

42:11.433 --> 42:14.133
-Hi.
-Hi. So sorry
to disturb you so late.

42:14.167 --> 42:16.667
-No, it's fine.
-I've got some news.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.500
-Sh--
-Yeah, shall we go out?
Yeah, that's fine.

42:23.833 --> 42:26.067
-What news?
-We believe we've found evidence

42:26.100 --> 42:29.333
which conclusively
exonerates you.

42:29.367 --> 42:31.100
If you'd like to come down
to the station tomorrow

42:31.133 --> 42:32.533
-I can go through it all
with you...
-Right.

42:32.567 --> 42:35.333
...in detail,
but we now believe

42:35.367 --> 42:39.833
that your wife
borrowed your coat
several months before she died,

42:39.867 --> 42:42.500
and the blood on it
was from then.

42:42.533 --> 42:45.433
From an encounter
with Tom Wilson.

42:45.467 --> 42:49.100
We also now know that he was
at your house until 11:30,

42:49.133 --> 42:54.300
which obviously supports
your original alibi.

42:54.333 --> 42:59.633
