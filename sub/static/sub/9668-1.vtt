02:26.900 --> 02:29.820
Aspen prison shuttle docked.

02:29.820 --> 02:33.020
Parolees prepare
to disembark.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.220
Ferguson, Herman.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.300
Six months sentence, Aspen Prison
served. Welcome back, citizen.

02:50.300 --> 02:54.500
Your living assignment is...
"Y" block, Heavenly Haven.

02:54.620 --> 02:57.620
Red quad. Move on.
Come on.

03:23.860 --> 03:25.860
Welcome home.

04:30.580 --> 04:33.500
That's it!
I think that's Heavenly Haven.

04:33.580 --> 04:37.700
- In your dreams, buddy.
- Yeah, Heavenly...

04:37.780 --> 04:40.980
Starting descent to Sector 12,
Yellow District.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.900
900 feet.

04:42.980 --> 04:44.580
700 feet.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.180
400 feet.

04:47.380 --> 04:50.700
Take caution in this sector.
There is a citizen riot in progress.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.700
Have a nice day.

05:23.780 --> 05:25.180
It's better than prison.

05:26.180 --> 05:27.980
Jesus Christ!

05:28.100 --> 05:32.380
Eat recycled food
for a happier, healthier life.

05:32.380 --> 05:35.180
Be kind and peaceful to each other.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.500
Eat recycled food.

05:37.580 --> 05:42.180
Recycled food. It's good for
the environment and okay for you.

05:47.740 --> 05:50.220
Hey...
Iook what I got!

05:51.540 --> 05:53.940
Little cupcake.

05:54.020 --> 05:58.220
What have we got here?
Are you a Judge spy, little man?

05:58.340 --> 06:02.140
Me... a spy?
This guy is funny.

06:02.220 --> 06:04.420
No, no, no.
I, I live here.

06:04.540 --> 06:09.020
I mean, I'm gonna live here, if I live.
Maybe I should go to a hotel?

06:09.020 --> 06:11.940
No way, man!
Don't you hear 'em out there?

06:11.940 --> 06:14.020
It's block war, man!

06:18.540 --> 06:20.620
- Block war.
- Yeah.

06:46.020 --> 06:48.820
Just like an Academy simulation
right down to the cross fire.

06:48.820 --> 06:51.620
- I'll lead off. You follow.
- This is no sim, rookie!

06:51.740 --> 06:54.020
We'll stand down
and wait for backup.

06:55.220 --> 06:58.420
Hershey and Brisco in position
outside Heavenly Haven!

06:58.540 --> 07:01.420
We're under fire
from the upper floors. Request backup.

07:01.540 --> 07:04.020
Cell "B" in Heavenly Haven,
on the corner of Abbott and Costello.

07:04.180 --> 07:07.060
Request backup.

07:42.580 --> 07:45.580
Holy crud!
He's a sitting duck out there.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.180
He knows what he's doing.

07:51.260 --> 07:53.660
I am... the Law!

07:55.980 --> 07:59.860
Drop... your weapons!

07:59.980 --> 08:04.260
These blocks...
are under... arrest!

08:06.860 --> 08:09.580
This is
your final warning!

08:09.660 --> 08:11.860
That's Judge Dredd, man!

08:11.980 --> 08:15.660
Hey! You wanna be afraid of somebody?
Be afraid of me!

08:15.780 --> 08:19.260
I got it! Why don't I
run down there and surrender?

08:19.380 --> 08:23.300
Sort of throw 'em off guard!
Bad idea.

08:23.380 --> 08:26.500
Hey, Dredd!
Come and get us!

08:31.220 --> 08:34.419
- I knew they'd do that.
- Judge Dredd, take cover!

08:34.500 --> 08:39.700
They're firing.20 millimeter
caseless flechette rounds at 300 meters.

08:39.700 --> 08:43.299
The effective lethal range
is 200 meters.

08:43.299 --> 08:47.700
You're safe. What are you doing
down there, Judge Hershey?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.620
Waiting for backup.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.100
It's here.

08:55.220 --> 08:58.220
Let's move it out.
Keep it simple. Single file.

08:58.300 --> 09:02.020
Standard relay.
I'm point. You're last.

09:04.620 --> 09:07.820
- Grenade.
- Grenade.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.100
- Nice shot, sir!
- You two meet me on the 40th.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.300
Hey, you need to get
some more ammo!

09:15.300 --> 09:19.900
Be kind and peaceful to each other.
Eat recycled food.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.300
Hey, you guys with us?

09:22.420 --> 09:26.300
Yeah! All right!
Let's rock 'n' roll!

09:36.020 --> 09:38.300
Dredd!

09:41.940 --> 09:44.460
This room
has been pacified.

09:44.540 --> 09:48.140
- Next one's mine!
- No! Rookie, hold on!

09:48.140 --> 09:50.260
This room
is under arrest!

09:51.340 --> 09:52.460
No!

09:52.540 --> 09:54.460
Die, Judges! Die!

09:57.140 --> 10:01.660
You're under arrest. Throw down
your weapons, and prepare to be judged!

10:01.740 --> 10:04.060
Judge this,
Lawgiver man!

10:04.140 --> 10:07.340
- No, don't! They're booby-trapped.
- Intruder.

10:07.460 --> 10:10.940
- Holy drok!

10:11.060 --> 10:13.940
Full auto.
Rapid-fire.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.860
Rapid-fire.

10:21.860 --> 10:24.540
- Armor piercing.
- Armor piercing.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.660
Drop dead, Dredd!

10:29.340 --> 10:32.860
- Double whammy.
- Double whammy.

10:38.540 --> 10:41.260
Mega City municipal code 213:

10:41.340 --> 10:44.260
Willful destruction of property.
That's two years.

10:44.340 --> 10:47.340
Code 310: Illegal possession
of assault weapons, five years.

10:47.540 --> 10:51.340
Code 457: Resisting arrest,
20 years!

10:53.340 --> 10:55.340
Thank you, Hershey.

10:56.860 --> 10:59.380
And code 3613:

10:59.460 --> 11:03.580
The first degree murder
of a Street Judge.

11:03.660 --> 11:06.260
Let me guess. Life.

11:09.660 --> 11:12.180
Death.

11:14.980 --> 11:16.780
Court's adjourned.

11:16.860 --> 11:20.380
Violence struck again in
Mega City tonight, taking a deadly toll.

11:20.460 --> 11:24.380
Fifty-three hospitalized,
five of them children. Nineteen dead.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.660
You got him?

11:26.780 --> 11:29.660
Bring him up. Okay. Now, just turn...
The other way. You got him?

11:29.660 --> 11:32.980
Damn it!

11:33.060 --> 11:34.860
I was supposed to be
watching out for him.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.980
Don't blame yourself, Hershey.
He made the mistake, not you.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.900
Wouldn't it feel good to have
an emotion once in a while, huh?

11:43.020 --> 11:47.100
Emotions. There oughta be
a law against them.

11:47.220 --> 11:50.700
- Eat recycled food.
- Halt!

11:50.700 --> 11:53.700
It's good for the environment,
and okay for you.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.900
Please make your selection.
Insert your credit in the slot.

11:57.020 --> 12:00.420
- You have five seconds to surrender!
- Dredd, it's just a servo-droid.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.420
- The servo-droid is your friend.
Please let your friend go by.
- Five. Four.

12:03.500 --> 12:07.020
- Three. Two.
- You are in the way of the servo-droid.

12:07.100 --> 12:11.620
- One!
- Boy, am I glad to see you!

12:11.700 --> 12:13.620
Mega City code 7592:

12:13.700 --> 12:16.220
Willful sabotage of a public droid.
That's six months, citizen.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.700
Let's see your Unicard.

12:18.820 --> 12:22.420
Come on, give me a break,
Judge... Dredd. Dredd?

12:22.500 --> 12:25.900
- God!
- Ferguson, Herman. Hacker.

12:25.900 --> 12:29.300
Illegal tampering with city droids,
computers, cash machines, taxi robots...

12:29.300 --> 12:32.020
And you haven't even been out of jail
for 24 hours. He's habitual, Hershey.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.500
Automatic five-year sentence.
How do you plead?

12:34.500 --> 12:38.020
- Not guilty?
- I knew you'd say that.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.820
Five years? No! No!
I... I had no choice.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.300
- They were killing each other.
- You could've gone out the window.

12:44.420 --> 12:49.300
- 40 floors? It would've been suicide.
- Maybe... but it's legal.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.020
- Judges?
- Yes, sir?
- What?

12:51.100 --> 12:53.900
Five years. Aspen Penitentiary.
Case closed. Take him away.

12:53.900 --> 12:57.700
Don't close the case.
You're misjudging me! Open the case!

12:57.820 --> 13:00.740
You're not going to be able
to sleep tonight.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.740
He might've been telling
the truth, you know.

13:02.860 --> 13:05.060
Haven't you ever heard of
extenuating circumstances?

13:05.140 --> 13:07.740
I've heard it all, Hershey.

13:09.460 --> 13:11.060
I knew you'd say that.

13:15.340 --> 13:16.660
My fellow Judges, have we forgotten
the lessons of history?

13:16.660 --> 13:20.140
My fellow Judges, have we forgotten
the lessons of history?

13:20.340 --> 13:23.340
However quickly these
block wars can be contained,

13:23.460 --> 13:26.340
it's clear that
they're becoming an epidemic;

13:26.340 --> 13:30.340
an epidemic that should
be dealt with... immediately.

13:30.460 --> 13:33.860
The only solution
is a tougher criminal code.

13:33.940 --> 13:36.660
Our situation gets worse
every day.

13:36.740 --> 13:40.860
73 citizen riots in 16 different
sectors in the last two months alone.

13:40.940 --> 13:44.740
Violent crime is rising
at 15Â°/o every quarter.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.940
If we don't increase
our resources,

13:47.060 --> 13:49.660
they will be inadequate
in less than three years.

13:49.740 --> 13:52.140
Three years?
Our resources are inadequate now!

13:52.260 --> 13:54.140
My fellow Council members,

13:54.260 --> 13:57.460
as a city
we continue to grow,

13:57.540 --> 13:59.660
and growth is painful.

13:59.740 --> 14:05.340
Sixty-five million people living in
an area designed for no more than 20!

14:05.460 --> 14:07.340
It's not enough
that they rely on us...

14:07.340 --> 14:10.060
for food, clothes, water,
clean air...

14:10.140 --> 14:13.460
Chief Justice,
the city is in chaos!

14:13.540 --> 14:16.540
For social order,
we need tighter reins.

14:16.660 --> 14:18.900
Incarceration hasn't worked
as a deterrent.

14:18.980 --> 14:22.980
I say we expand execution
to include lesser crimes!

14:24.900 --> 14:26.700
My fellow Judges,

14:26.780 --> 14:30.900
I was barely in my teens
when I put on this badge.

14:30.980 --> 14:33.300
When the time comes for me
to take it off,

14:33.380 --> 14:38.100
please let me do so knowing that
it still stands for freedom...

14:38.180 --> 14:41.580
and not for repression.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.300
- 53 hospitalized.

14:44.380 --> 14:47.780
Nineteen dead, four of them
killed by a gang of squatters...

14:47.900 --> 14:51.100
who were themselves killed
in summary executions by Judge Dredd.

14:51.180 --> 14:54.780
As my special undercover
report continues,

14:54.780 --> 14:57.780
I will take you behind the
scenes at the Halls of Justice...

14:57.900 --> 15:02.300
for a disturbing probe into
these recent riots and block wars.

15:02.380 --> 15:05.300
Coincidence...
or deliberate?

15:05.380 --> 15:05.980
Dredd!

15:05.980 --> 15:07.500
Dredd!

15:07.580 --> 15:11.900
Some people think working these mean
streets has a dehumanizing effect on...

15:20.780 --> 15:23.580
- Joseph.
- Chief Justice Fargo.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.780
You may stand at ease,
Joseph.

15:35.380 --> 15:40.820
So, tell me. Seven summary executions.
Were they necessary?

15:40.820 --> 15:42.740
Unavoidable, sir.

15:42.820 --> 15:44.620
Unavoidable.

15:44.740 --> 15:47.220
Life doesn't mean much
to some people anymore.

15:47.340 --> 15:52.020
- You'd see that if you weren't always...
- If I weren't what?

15:52.020 --> 15:53.620
Always at the Academy,
sir.

15:53.620 --> 16:00.220
Oh! Don't you mean,
at the Academy wiping cadets' asses?

16:00.340 --> 16:02.620
That's what they say
in the squad room, isn't it?

16:02.740 --> 16:05.540
It's irrelevant.
You set the standard, sir.

16:05.620 --> 16:09.420
Now you do...
at least to many young cadets.

16:09.540 --> 16:11.540
You're a legend.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.620
Sir.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.340
You remember your days
as a cadet, Joseph?

16:16.420 --> 16:18.340
I remember what
you taught me, sir.

16:18.420 --> 16:22.020
You were my finest student.

16:22.140 --> 16:25.140
So, I've drawn
a new assignment for you.

16:25.220 --> 16:29.420
Starting tomorrow, you're going to
spend two days a week at the Academy.

16:29.540 --> 16:32.020
I'd be honored, sir.
Narmed combat or marksmanship?

16:32.220 --> 16:34.020
Ethics.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.260
Wait here.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.460
Remain still. Identify yourself.

17:12.579 --> 17:14.780
Miller. Warden.

17:14.859 --> 17:18.180
Voice sample recognized.
Thank you, Warden. System disarmed.

17:18.260 --> 17:23.260
Why are you here?
Did you come for another chat?

17:23.380 --> 17:26.460
Just a short one, I'm afraid.
Duty calls.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.460
Ah, duty!

17:28.460 --> 17:33.660
Feeding these parasites here
at the public's expense?

17:33.660 --> 17:37.660
Yeah.
You especially!

17:37.780 --> 17:41.460
I don't cost anything.

17:41.580 --> 17:43.460
I'm a ghost.

17:43.460 --> 17:46.980
And we're both
prisoners here.

17:47.060 --> 17:51.180
You're behind your desk...
and I'm behind this.

17:52.580 --> 17:56.460
What a clever reward
from Fargo, huh?

17:56.460 --> 17:58.180
I mean,
considering the services.

17:58.260 --> 18:02.780
When you started killing
innocent people, Rico,

18:02.860 --> 18:05.060
you went beyond service.

18:05.180 --> 18:09.060
The innocent exist only until they
inevitably become perpetrators...

18:09.260 --> 18:11.180
like you.

18:12.580 --> 18:15.860
Guilt and innocence...

18:16.020 --> 18:17.900
is a matter of timing.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.620
Your...

18:20.700 --> 18:24.100
Our mysterious benefactor...

18:24.220 --> 18:26.700
has sent you a package.

18:30.020 --> 18:33.700
Deactivate shield.
Autoguns only.

18:33.820 --> 18:37.100
Autoguns reactivated, Warden Miller.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.820
Hmm.

18:43.900 --> 18:48.300
- What is that?
- It's an ancient puzzle...

18:48.420 --> 18:51.620
that contains
the meaning of life.

18:56.020 --> 18:58.900
So, tell me, Rico,

18:59.020 --> 19:01.700
what is the meaning of life?

19:04.620 --> 19:07.020
It ends.

19:09.300 --> 19:12.020
Stop! Computer!

19:12.100 --> 19:16.220
Activate alarm!

19:16.300 --> 19:19.820
Voice not recognized.
Guns are training.

19:19.820 --> 19:22.500
Remain still.

19:26.220 --> 19:29.700
Security, override and unlock!
Come on!

19:49.060 --> 19:53.060
Kevlar 9 helmet and body armor.
Yours... when you graduate.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.460
Lawgiver Two.

19:57.540 --> 20:02.060
25-round side arm with mission-variable
voice-programmed ammunition.

20:02.140 --> 20:04.660
- Signal flare.
- Flare.

20:06.940 --> 20:10.460
Yours...
if you graduate.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.460
Mark 4 Lawmaster,
improved model,

20:13.540 --> 20:15.340
with dual on-board laser cannons,

20:15.460 --> 20:17.540
vertical take-off
and landing flight capability.

20:17.660 --> 20:20.540
Range: 500 kilometers.

20:20.540 --> 20:24.060
- Men.
- Yes, sir.

20:24.140 --> 20:27.540
Active. Malfunction. Malfunction.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.740
Malfunction.

20:29.860 --> 20:32.660
Hmm?

20:35.340 --> 20:37.460
Yours if you can
ever get it to work.

20:39.940 --> 20:43.740
All of these things
you see here are toys.

20:43.740 --> 20:47.660
At the end of the day
when you're all alone in the dark,

20:47.740 --> 20:53.140
the only thing that counts...
is this: The Law.

20:54.700 --> 20:59.100
And you will be alone
when you swear to uphold these ideals.

21:00.380 --> 21:03.500
For most of us,
there's only death in the streets.

21:03.580 --> 21:05.980
For the few of us
that survive to old age,

21:06.100 --> 21:10.100
the proud loneliness
of the Long Walk.

21:10.180 --> 21:12.980
A walk that every Judge
must take...

21:13.100 --> 21:15.500
outside these city walls...

21:15.580 --> 21:17.980
into the unknown
of the Cursed Earth.

21:18.100 --> 21:21.700
And there spend
your last remaining days...

21:21.780 --> 21:25.900
taking law to the lawless.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.980
This is what it means
to be a Judge.

21:30.100 --> 21:35.100
This is the commitment
I expect.

21:35.180 --> 21:38.900
Class dismissed.

21:38.980 --> 21:40.980
Attention all personnel.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.500
Due to the recent disturbance
in Heavenly Haven,

21:43.580 --> 21:47.380
there will be increased patrols
in Sector 4.

21:47.500 --> 21:50.780
Please check with your commanders
to see if you are affected...

21:50.900 --> 21:52.900
by these scheduled changes.

21:54.300 --> 21:57.380
I can hear you thinking.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.300
I caught your lecture today.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.780
Is that really what you
think the cadets need to hear?

22:01.900 --> 22:05.580
- What I told them is the truth.
- Your truth maybe.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.980
You made it sound like our lives
are practically over.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.780
Don't you think...
parts are, Hershey?

22:10.900 --> 22:13.380
I have a personal life.
I have friends.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.300
You're one of the smartest
of the new breed,

22:15.380 --> 22:17.220
but you've only been
on the street a year.

22:17.340 --> 22:21.220
You haven't gotten used to
the isolation yet.

22:22.820 --> 22:26.020
No. No,
I don't think that's right.

22:26.020 --> 22:28.820
No one is supposed
to be alone all the time.

22:28.820 --> 22:33.020
I mean, is that really what
it's been like for you?

22:33.140 --> 22:36.820
Don't you ever...
haven't you ever had a friend?

22:38.420 --> 22:40.820
Yes. Once.

22:41.020 --> 22:42.740
What happened?

22:46.140 --> 22:48.820
Dredd, wait.

22:48.940 --> 22:50.820
I want to know.
What happened?

22:52.620 --> 22:54.540
I judged him.

23:03.020 --> 23:06.220
Aspen shuttle has completed off-loading.

23:06.420 --> 23:11.420
- Cargo and morgue shipments from Aspen.
- Okay.

23:11.420 --> 23:14.620
Let's get outta here.

23:44.780 --> 23:48.380
Get your nose filters!
Get your nose filters!

23:50.260 --> 23:53.580
Please select your fantasy now
and enjoy.

23:53.660 --> 23:56.180
...who were themselves killed...

23:56.260 --> 23:59.260
in summary executions
by Judge Dredd.

23:59.260 --> 24:01.260
As my special
undercover report continues,

24:01.460 --> 24:04.780
I will take you behind the scenes
at the Halls of Justice.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.780
We're closed for the night.

24:26.060 --> 24:28.860
You're holding a package for me.
The code name is Lazarus.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.460
I'll just be a second.

24:36.060 --> 24:38.460
You got a nice place.

24:38.580 --> 24:42.460
Yeah.
A lot of this is antiques.

24:42.580 --> 24:47.060
I thought they destroyed all these
A.B.C. Warriors during the last war.

24:47.180 --> 24:49.060
Well, you can
still collect 'em...

24:49.180 --> 24:52.100
as long as they're nonfunctioning...
like my wife.

24:52.180 --> 24:55.900
- These must be 50 or 60 years old now.

24:56.020 --> 24:57.620
Anyway...

24:58.900 --> 25:01.220
there you go.

25:09.020 --> 25:12.300
- Hey, wait a second! Don't touch it.
- Why is that?

25:12.420 --> 25:17.020
It's a Lawgiver. That's programmed
to only recognize a Judge's hand.

25:17.100 --> 25:20.220
You touch that,
it'll take your arm off.

25:21.500 --> 25:26.100
Gee... how do you like that?
I must be a Judge.

25:56.820 --> 26:00.500
Happy birthday.

26:11.540 --> 26:14.260
Status?

26:18.340 --> 26:20.740
Bodyguard.

26:20.860 --> 26:24.260
- Commander?
- Rico.

26:24.340 --> 26:29.140
- Mission?
- Mission? We're going to war.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.340
War.

26:36.940 --> 26:40.540
I followed up some grumblings
confirming a suspicion of mine.

26:40.660 --> 26:44.140
The cancer of oppression
goes far deeper than the Street Judges.

26:44.140 --> 26:46.540
- You're going to say that over the air?
- It's the truth!

26:46.660 --> 26:49.860
- Oh, Vardas, you're insane.
- I'm a reporter.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.260
They're never going to let
this get onto the air.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.940
Something like this could
bring down the Council.

26:54.940 --> 26:59.740
Maybe it should. The whole system
is the problem, not just judge...

27:00.340 --> 27:02.860
Dredd. No!

27:15.540 --> 27:17.860
Judge Hershey, corner of
burns and allen. Level "d."

27:17.940 --> 27:21.060
Possible D... l.
May need assistance.

27:22.460 --> 27:26.540
Here we go!

27:26.660 --> 27:29.940
- Step out of the car, please.
- What the hell's the problem now?

27:29.940 --> 27:33.380
Get out of the car!
Nicard, please.

27:35.980 --> 27:37.780
Did you hear me?
Nicard!

27:40.500 --> 27:44.980
Mr. Souza. You have
a suspended license.

27:44.980 --> 27:47.900
- You've got three counts of
driving under the influence.
- Hey, you better listen.

27:47.980 --> 27:51.180
I suggest you walk away
and bother somebody else.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.980
When I said I have powerful friends,
I mean powerful!

27:53.980 --> 27:57.980
- Are we having a problem, Hershey?
- Not at all. Nothing I can't handle.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.100
Suspended license.
Three D... l.'s.

28:00.100 --> 28:04.300
This is getting boring.
Okay, so what's the tab? C'mon.

28:04.380 --> 28:07.100
How much is this going to cost me?
You name your price.

28:07.180 --> 28:09.980
Hershey, call Control
for an H-wagon.

28:09.980 --> 28:13.180
What? I don't believe it.
You're going to tow me?

28:13.180 --> 28:16.300
Towing is for a first offense. This
is your fourth violation, bar breath.

28:16.300 --> 28:18.900
- You're a menace. How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

28:18.980 --> 28:21.580
I knew you'd say that.

28:21.580 --> 28:23.700
- Wait a second. What are you doing?
- Grenade.

28:23.780 --> 28:25.780
- Grenade.
- No!

28:30.700 --> 28:32.980
Happy motoring.

28:36.380 --> 28:37.780
- Subtle.
- Mm-hmm.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.500
Judge Joseph Dredd.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.500
Dredd,
you're under arrest.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.580
What's the charge?

28:47.580 --> 28:49.300
Murder.

28:54.340 --> 28:59.220
Attention. Chief Justice Fargo
now entering maximum security area.

29:08.020 --> 29:09.820
- Joseph.
- Sir.

29:12.940 --> 29:16.140
- Is it true?
- I'm innocent.

29:17.140 --> 29:19.420
The Council is said
to have irrefutable proof.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.620
Do you believe that?

29:21.620 --> 29:24.340
There is to be
a full tribunal.

29:24.340 --> 29:27.820
- A conviction means death.
- Do you believe that, sir?

29:34.340 --> 29:37.820
I just needed to look
into your eyes for myself.

29:37.940 --> 29:41.020
I'm sorry I asked.

29:41.020 --> 29:44.820
I would never do anything to
disgrace you with the Council, sir.

29:44.820 --> 29:49.620
I'll use every resource
to find out, Joseph.

29:49.740 --> 29:52.620
Have you selected
someone to defend you?

29:52.620 --> 29:56.220
- Judge Hershey.
- Hershey? Why a Street Judge?

29:56.220 --> 30:00.340
At the Academy, she was at the top
of her class in interpretational law.

30:00.420 --> 30:03.220
And I trust her.

30:03.340 --> 30:05.340
The facts will come out
at the tribunal.

30:05.420 --> 30:08.220
I'll personally
make sure of that.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.780
Sir?

30:11.860 --> 30:15.660
I'm sorry about this.

30:20.460 --> 30:24.180
- Dredd! No!

30:24.260 --> 30:27.060
Play back.

30:27.180 --> 30:29.660
- Dredd! No!

30:29.780 --> 30:34.780
- Dredd! No!

30:36.260 --> 30:39.060
Play back.

30:39.060 --> 30:42.780
Stop video. The video
you have just seen...

30:42.860 --> 30:47.180
is prima facie evidence that
the defendant is guilty as charged.

30:47.260 --> 30:49.460
Mark it
people's exhibit "a."

30:49.460 --> 30:51.380
Objection, Your Honor.

30:51.380 --> 30:54.380
This video is inadmissible
as evidence.

30:54.460 --> 30:57.980
- If I may be given a moment to explain?
- Please do.

30:58.060 --> 31:03.260
I have an affidavit from Nathan Olmeyer,
currently a junior at the Academy.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.660
Cadet Olmeyer has
been acknowledged...

31:05.660 --> 31:09.460
by every one of his instructors to be
an expert in digital and video graphics.

31:10.460 --> 31:15.780
His affidavit states this surveillance
video is of such low definition,

31:15.860 --> 31:19.260
no positive identification
can be made of the killer.

31:19.260 --> 31:20.860
Your Honors,

31:20.980 --> 31:23.420
we know that the uniform of a Judge
can be counterfeit...

31:23.380 --> 31:25.180
and that the badge
can be duplicated,

31:25.300 --> 31:28.180
and since neither the video
nor the audio in this presentation...

31:28.180 --> 31:31.100
can identify the accused
in any way,

31:31.180 --> 31:34.980
I repeat my objection to this video
being allowed as evidence in this case,

31:35.100 --> 31:37.180
and I ask for a ruling.

31:46.980 --> 31:49.900
Objection sustained.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.700
The video is inadmissible.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.300
Yes!

31:54.300 --> 31:56.980
Shh.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.780
Admit it, Dredd.

31:58.780 --> 32:02.100
- What?
- You're impressed.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.980
- Very.
- You owe me.

32:04.100 --> 32:06.180
- Hmm.
- Very well.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.100
I'm therefore forced to move...

32:08.180 --> 32:10.540
to technical information
of a critical nature.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.020
I will need
the court's permission...

32:13.140 --> 32:16.940
to access top-secret
documentation...

32:16.940 --> 32:18.940
with the help of
Central Computer Bank.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.540
You may proceed.

32:20.620 --> 32:22.820
Central,
are you on-line?

32:22.820 --> 32:24.820
On-line, Judge McGruder.

32:24.820 --> 32:27.620
I wish you to access
weapons schematic.

32:27.620 --> 32:31.820
Describe the working of the standard
Judge's side arm, the Lawgiver Two.

32:31.820 --> 32:35.140
Model Two is
coded to the personal D.N. A...

32:35.220 --> 32:36.940
of the Judge using the weapon...

32:36.900 --> 32:40.020
via the skin's contact with the grip,
a fail-safe security...

32:40.100 --> 32:42.300
- Did you know about this?
- No!

32:42.420 --> 32:44.820
The D.N.A. Is obtained
from my medical files,

32:44.820 --> 32:48.740
and upgraded automatically
every time the weapon is reloaded.

32:48.820 --> 32:51.140
Each time a round
is chambered and fired...

32:51.260 --> 32:54.340
the projectile is tagged
with the relevant D.N.A.

32:54.460 --> 32:57.860
Chief Justice, the defense was not
made aware of any of this information.

32:57.940 --> 33:01.940
Judge Hershey, the prosecution
must be given time to finish.

33:04.140 --> 33:10.860
Central, were the bullets recovered from
the bodies of Vardas and Lily Hammond...

33:10.860 --> 33:12.940
so D.N.A. Coded?

33:13.060 --> 33:17.340
Yes, Judge McGruder.
It could not be otherwise.

33:17.460 --> 33:21.140
And what was
the result of the computer check...

33:21.140 --> 33:23.860
of the D.N.A. Coding
on those bullets?

33:23.940 --> 33:27.260
The D.N.A. Is
a perfect match for Judge Joseph Dredd.

33:27.340 --> 33:30.460
It's a lie!
The evidence has been falsified.

33:30.540 --> 33:34.940
It's impossible!
I never broke the Law! I am the Law!

33:34.940 --> 33:38.460
- We have no case.
- You gotta believe me!

33:38.540 --> 33:41.340
You have to believe me.
Say it.

33:41.460 --> 33:45.740
Your Honor...
the prosecution rests.

33:51.340 --> 33:54.460
The Tribunal needs to confer!

34:00.340 --> 34:04.540
What have I done?
How could I have been so wrong?

34:04.540 --> 34:09.179
Dredd!
Both of them homicidal.

34:09.300 --> 34:12.380
Only this time it will be
impossible to cover up.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.980
Chief Justice,

34:15.100 --> 34:18.980
we carefully buried the Janus project
nine years ago...

34:18.980 --> 34:22.380
along with Rico
and all his victims.

34:22.380 --> 34:25.100
No one will ever learn
of your involvement.

34:25.179 --> 34:27.699
The media knows
how close I am to Dredd.

34:27.699 --> 34:31.179
They'll dig until
the whole truth comes out.

34:31.300 --> 34:34.699
It's the perfect excuse to ruin
what government we have left.

34:34.780 --> 34:36.780
Your motives were pure.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.980
You thought Dredd was different.
That's why you spared him.

34:38.980 --> 34:41.780
A mistake which may bring
down the judicial system.

34:49.780 --> 34:52.300
There is a way out,
Chief Justice.

34:52.380 --> 34:55.980
If you will forgive me.
The Long Walk.

35:00.100 --> 35:03.980
That's a death sentence,
Judge Griffin. Mine.

35:04.100 --> 35:08.100
Your retirement grants you
the power to save Dredd's life!

35:09.980 --> 35:13.380
This gesture...

35:13.500 --> 35:16.980
may also allow Janus
to remain a secret.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.820
In the charge
of premeditated murder,

35:26.900 --> 35:31.620
this tribunal finds
Joseph Dredd...

35:31.740 --> 35:34.020
guilty as charged.

35:36.420 --> 35:38.020
Joseph Dredd,

35:38.020 --> 35:43.020
you're aware the law allows
only one punishment for your crime.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.220
Death.

35:45.220 --> 35:48.940
However, it has long been
our custom...

35:49.020 --> 35:54.420
to carry out the last order
of a retiring Senior Judge.

35:55.940 --> 35:57.820
And so...

36:02.820 --> 36:04.540
I step down.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.420
No!

36:10.020 --> 36:11.540
As I leave...

36:11.620 --> 36:14.820
to take my Long Walk
into the Cursed Earth,

36:14.940 --> 36:19.740
I ask that this court
honor my last order.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.620
Be lenient
with Judge Dredd...

36:23.620 --> 36:26.140
in gratitude
for his years of service.

36:26.220 --> 36:29.940
We will so honor this one,
Judge Fargo.

36:34.420 --> 36:37.220
Dredd, step forward.

36:40.540 --> 36:43.340
The sentence shall be
life imprisonment...

36:43.420 --> 36:46.780
at Aspen Penal Colony,
to be carried out immediately...

36:46.860 --> 36:48.860
as it is written!

36:48.980 --> 36:52.860
Justice Griffin, this trial has been
a farce! I demand an appeal!

36:52.980 --> 36:56.980
You will accept the court's decision,
Judge Hershey!

37:09.580 --> 37:11.860
Dredd, I'm so sorry.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.060
I let you down.

37:15.980 --> 37:19.060
You did your best, Hershey.
Thank you.

37:20.260 --> 37:22.580
Let the betrayer of the Law...

37:22.660 --> 37:25.780
be taken from our courts.

37:25.860 --> 37:28.460
Let his armor
be taken from him,

37:28.580 --> 37:31.580
and all his garb of justice.

37:31.660 --> 37:37.260
Let him be stricken from our hearts
and our memory... forever.

37:45.860 --> 37:50.260
Let his name be recorded
in every place of honor.

37:53.380 --> 37:56.580
Let him take the Law
he served so well...

37:56.660 --> 37:59.460
to those who have it not.

38:02.460 --> 38:05.260
Let him be written...

38:05.380 --> 38:10.620
in our hearts and
our memories... forever.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.620
Attention all judges.
You are reminded...

38:59.700 --> 39:02.500
Judge Hershey.

39:16.700 --> 39:18.900
It's gotta be here some...

39:25.740 --> 39:27.740
What's this?

39:30.340 --> 39:32.660
Baby Dredd?

39:32.740 --> 39:35.060
I can't believe
you were ever a baby.

39:38.340 --> 39:40.940
Who's this?

39:58.060 --> 40:00.940
Chief Justice Griffin.

40:05.540 --> 40:07.860
It's got a nice ring
to it.

40:07.940 --> 40:10.940
We were supposed
to meet someplace safe!

40:18.740 --> 40:23.740
What's not safe?
Your reporter's dead, right?

40:23.740 --> 40:25.740
Fargo's on his Walk.

40:25.860 --> 40:28.340
Dredd's in Aspen.

40:28.340 --> 40:31.060
So, what's not safe?

40:31.140 --> 40:34.460
It's unfortunate.

40:34.540 --> 40:38.860
Hammond had to be silenced.
He found out about Janus.

40:38.940 --> 40:42.580
- But I could've used Dredd.
- Forget Dredd!

40:42.580 --> 40:44.780
There is no Dredd!

40:44.900 --> 40:47.700
Let me tell you
what Dredd worships.

40:47.780 --> 40:49.700
He worships the Law!

40:49.780 --> 40:53.700
He'd have blown you away the minute he
found out how much you're pissin' on it.

40:55.980 --> 41:00.780
Yeah. Let him see what it's like
to freeze his ass off in Aspen.

41:00.780 --> 41:02.900
Let him see what it's like
to be me!

41:04.980 --> 41:07.100
There's a lot of work
to be done.

41:07.180 --> 41:11.100
Janus.
Well, where is it?

41:11.180 --> 41:13.100
- You'll see it!
- When?

41:13.180 --> 41:16.100
Soon enough!

41:22.300 --> 41:26.180
In the meantime,
I want chaos, Rico.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.580
That block war
was just the beginning.

41:28.580 --> 41:32.700
Now I want fear
racing through every street!

41:32.780 --> 41:36.100
And the Council
will have to turn to me.

41:36.100 --> 41:38.580
And to Janus!

41:38.700 --> 41:42.580
You want fear?
I'm fear.

41:42.700 --> 41:45.780
You want chaos?
I'm the chaos.

41:45.900 --> 41:49.580
You want a new beginning? Here!
I am the new beginning!

41:58.580 --> 42:00.780
This is Aspen Shuttle CF-188.

42:00.900 --> 42:05.220
Due to storm cloud activity over the
desert, we will be flying at 60 feet.

42:05.340 --> 42:08.620
Flight time approximately
four hours.

42:25.940 --> 42:29.420
Dredd? Don't hit me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Don't hurt me.

42:29.540 --> 42:32.340
What are you doing here?

42:32.420 --> 42:36.820
I was convicted of a crime.
Wrongly convicted.

42:39.740 --> 42:42.540
Really?
That's kinda weird.

42:42.540 --> 42:44.420
What are the odds?

42:44.540 --> 42:48.420
Two wrongly-convicted guys
sittin' right next to each other.

42:48.540 --> 42:50.940
You received the sentence
the Law required.

42:51.020 --> 42:55.940
Five years...
just for saving my own ass?

42:56.020 --> 42:57.940
That was a mistake!

42:58.020 --> 43:01.220
The Law doesn't make mistakes.

43:01.340 --> 43:05.220
Really? Then how do you explain
what happened to you?

43:08.620 --> 43:11.940
You can't... can you?

43:13.020 --> 43:16.420
Great!
Mr. "I am the law" can't.

43:16.540 --> 43:20.220
So, maybe,
this is some kind of typo.

43:20.420 --> 43:22.220
Maybe it's a glitch.

43:22.380 --> 43:25.580
Or maybe
it's poetic justice!

43:34.460 --> 43:36.780
Shuttle comin'! Shuttle!
Shuttle!

43:36.780 --> 43:40.180
Shuttle comin', Pa!
Look!

43:42.660 --> 43:47.380
Praise the Lord for bringing us
this generous bounty.

43:47.460 --> 43:52.580
My sons...
gather the harvest.

43:55.380 --> 43:59.060
So maybe you're here
as some sort of field trip.

43:59.060 --> 44:01.380
Yeah!

44:01.460 --> 44:05.060
Maybe this is some
sort of... surprise party.

44:05.060 --> 44:08.260
Whoo! Gonna catch me
some city boy!

44:12.860 --> 44:15.980
It's payback time, Dredd!

44:34.180 --> 44:36.980
Dredd, what's happening?

44:40.820 --> 44:44.500
By a blast of God
they perish.

44:44.620 --> 44:47.500
And by a breath of His nostrils
are they consumed.

44:49.300 --> 44:51.300
Hallelujah!

44:59.420 --> 45:02.700
Central, I need you
to access graphics data base.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.100
I want you to run
an I.D. On this man.

45:05.220 --> 45:07.700
Scanning for identity. Nknown male,

45:07.700 --> 45:11.900
approximately 200 centimeters tall,
skin tone three.

45:12.020 --> 45:13.900
Ten, nine, eight...

45:16.020 --> 45:18.300
Central? Hello?

45:18.420 --> 45:22.220
This terminal has been
terminated from the main system.

45:22.300 --> 45:25.900
Your authority has been removed,
Judge Hershey.

45:32.420 --> 45:36.100
This is Group Leader.
We've located the shuttle.

45:44.300 --> 45:47.100
This is Capture Team.
There's no sign of Dredd.

45:47.220 --> 45:49.620
He appears to have survived the crash.

45:49.700 --> 45:53.020
You are in error, Capture
Team. No one survived the shuttle wreck.

45:53.100 --> 45:55.220
Understand?
Just find Dredd!

45:55.220 --> 45:57.500
The pilot, sir.
He's alive.

45:57.500 --> 46:00.740
No one survived the shuttle wreck!
Do I make myself clear?

46:00.820 --> 46:02.340
Yes, sir.

46:18.140 --> 46:19.460
Am I dead?

46:19.540 --> 46:22.740
Am I dead?
I'm dead!

46:28.460 --> 46:30.740
- Awake!

46:30.860 --> 46:32.340
Good!

46:32.460 --> 46:36.940
We're running out
of sinners.

46:37.060 --> 46:38.540
Oh, my God!

46:45.140 --> 46:48.540
- Dredd, do something!
- Dredd?

46:48.660 --> 46:51.460
You talk too much.

46:51.540 --> 46:52.940
Can it be?

47:06.540 --> 47:10.540
The great man
of the Law himself.

47:15.140 --> 47:19.460
O Lord, you have
blessed us indeed!

47:19.540 --> 47:24.100
Judge "rat" Dredd.

47:24.180 --> 47:25.900
You creeps
are under arrest.

47:25.980 --> 47:28.100
Is that so?

47:28.180 --> 47:30.180
Let me crush him, Pa.

47:30.300 --> 47:33.900
- Excuse me. We're not together.

47:33.980 --> 47:37.380
Allow me to introduce you
to my family.

47:37.500 --> 47:40.300
- There's Link, my oldest.
- Bite me!

47:40.380 --> 47:41.500
Hi!

47:41.580 --> 47:43.700
My youngest, Junior.

47:43.780 --> 47:45.780
- Howdy.
- Hi!

47:47.500 --> 47:49.900
And this here is Mean.

47:49.980 --> 47:53.980
We had to make some alterations
when he was a child.

47:54.100 --> 47:57.100
The Cursed Earth's
a tough place on young folks.

47:57.180 --> 48:01.780
I now have him set on one.
I don't suggest you make him angry.

48:03.380 --> 48:05.580
The legendary Angel family.

48:06.980 --> 48:08.980
Cursed Earth pirates,

48:09.100 --> 48:12.300
murderers, scavengers.

48:12.380 --> 48:17.580
- And, of course, scumbags.
- Oh, that'll win 'em over!

48:17.580 --> 48:20.580
Did I leave something out,
Pa?

48:20.700 --> 48:22.780
- Let me kill 'im, Pa. I want his ears.
- I want his teeth.

48:29.300 --> 48:33.180
Does that come with a fork,
handsome?

48:41.220 --> 48:43.340
Hallelujah, brother!

48:43.420 --> 48:45.740
Wait a minute.
Can it be?

48:45.820 --> 48:48.620
Can it be that from
the city of the fallen...

48:48.620 --> 48:51.420
- we have one of the faithful?
- Amen, brother!

48:52.540 --> 48:56.220
- Praise the Lord! I'm a believer!
- Fergie, don't do it.

48:56.340 --> 48:58.740
It sounds like we have
a believer in the gallery.

48:58.740 --> 49:00.420
- Yes!
- Cut him down!

49:00.540 --> 49:02.620
- Go tell it on the mountain!
- Fergie.

49:07.140 --> 49:09.140
You're making
a big mistake.

49:09.220 --> 49:12.220
Well, Dredd, maybe the Law
doesn't make mistakes,

49:12.340 --> 49:15.420
but I'm free
and you're toast.

49:15.540 --> 49:18.340
Actually, you're toast.

49:18.420 --> 49:22.540
I forgot to mention it.
Your new friends,

49:22.620 --> 49:24.420
they're cannibals.

49:26.740 --> 49:30.820
- Fresh meat.
- Prepare the supplicant for sacrifice.

49:30.940 --> 49:33.020
No, wait.
You can't eat me!

49:33.140 --> 49:36.620
I've got eczema. I've got warts.
I've had gonorrhea.

49:36.740 --> 49:39.540
Eat Dredd.
He works out.

49:39.540 --> 49:44.540
Yum, yum.
It's been fun, Lawman.

49:47.540 --> 49:49.820
Finish Dredd.

49:49.820 --> 49:52.420
My pleasure, Pa.

49:52.540 --> 49:54.420
Come on.

49:58.660 --> 50:00.780
Come on!

50:01.780 --> 50:03.380
Come on, Junior!

50:04.580 --> 50:05.380
- Guilty!

50:09.860 --> 50:12.140
- Shut up!

50:17.940 --> 50:20.540
- Dredd, look out!

50:26.220 --> 50:28.340
There's Dredd!

50:40.780 --> 50:44.180
- Go!

51:12.180 --> 51:14.980
Well, we did it.
We got 'em all.

51:15.060 --> 51:17.260
- Hmm.
- Pussies! Is that all you got?

51:17.380 --> 51:19.460
They are dead, right?

51:20.580 --> 51:22.460
Have you been crying?

51:22.660 --> 51:25.060
I'm not crying.
I got something in my eye.

51:25.180 --> 51:27.460
You ever have allergies?
Dredd, look out!

51:37.860 --> 51:42.980
- Chief Justice!
- Joseph, together again.

51:43.060 --> 51:45.060
Together again, sir.

51:47.060 --> 51:50.380
- No!

51:56.860 --> 51:59.620
- God, not again!

52:03.500 --> 52:06.500
You got three strikes,
Lawman!

52:06.620 --> 52:09.700
Strike one.

52:09.820 --> 52:12.420
Strike two!

52:14.700 --> 52:17.500
Strike three.

52:17.620 --> 52:20.020
You're out, Lawman!

52:20.100 --> 52:23.220
You killed Link!
You killed Junior!

52:23.300 --> 52:25.500
You killed my brothers!

52:25.500 --> 52:27.900
You even killed my pa.

52:31.300 --> 52:34.100
Mega City municipal code 4722:

52:34.100 --> 52:37.300
Illegal use
of city electricity.

52:37.420 --> 52:39.700
- How do you plead?

52:39.820 --> 52:43.020
I knew you'd say that!

52:46.900 --> 52:50.220
Graphics analysis now.

52:50.300 --> 52:53.900
Olmeyer, you stupid futz!
I can't...

52:54.100 --> 52:57.220
You analyzed the wrong viewie,
all right. The wrong one. This one!

52:57.300 --> 53:01.220
I don't believe it.
You just wasted three hours.

53:01.300 --> 53:04.900
If this is
the wrong picture,

53:04.900 --> 53:07.620
Why is it fake?

53:07.700 --> 53:09.500
What?

53:09.620 --> 53:13.820
Look. It's full of anomalies.
Really clever ones too.

53:13.820 --> 53:18.260
Somebody must've used a C.G.I. Terminal
and a scan quad to make this.

53:18.260 --> 53:21.940
This is state-of-the-art...
twenty years ago.

53:22.060 --> 53:24.340
Are you saying
this isn't real?

53:24.460 --> 53:27.540
Yeah. Look, I'll drop out
all the artificial pixels.

53:27.660 --> 53:31.740
Dad. Mom.

53:31.860 --> 53:33.340
Foreground.

53:33.540 --> 53:36.540
Background.
All fake.

53:37.740 --> 53:40.740
The only thing that's real
is the baby.

53:51.540 --> 53:53.940
Oh. The blind lady.

53:56.340 --> 53:57.940
Who is she?

53:57.940 --> 54:01.460
Justice...
before your time.

54:01.460 --> 54:05.140
We should never have taken
justice out of her hands.

54:05.260 --> 54:09.140
- You brought order to chaos, sir.
- That we did.

54:09.260 --> 54:12.940
Solved many problems,
and created many more!

54:13.060 --> 54:17.540
- Being a Judge, Joseph,

54:17.660 --> 54:21.940
perhaps too much power
in one person's hands.

54:22.060 --> 54:26.740
We once tried to compensate:
Create the perfect Judge.

54:26.940 --> 54:28.740
We called it Janus.

54:28.940 --> 54:31.740
Four decades ago,

54:31.860 --> 54:36.260
D.N.A. Samples were taken
from the original Council.

54:36.340 --> 54:38.780
One was chosen.
Mine.

54:38.900 --> 54:42.380
We altered it to enhance
the best qualities...

54:42.580 --> 54:44.980
and screen out the worst:

54:44.980 --> 54:47.580
Weaknesses, frailties.

54:49.780 --> 54:51.380
We created you.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.980
You didn't create me,
sir.

54:55.980 --> 54:58.980
- I have a family.
- No.

54:59.100 --> 55:02.580
At the Academy, you told me they
were killed when I was very young.

55:02.700 --> 55:04.580
A lie.

55:05.580 --> 55:07.580
I have a picture of them.

55:07.700 --> 55:10.980
A fake.
We lied... to both of you.

55:10.980 --> 55:13.500
Both?

55:13.580 --> 55:17.180
There was another infant
created in that experiment,

55:17.180 --> 55:20.180
but something went wrong.

55:20.300 --> 55:23.380
Genetically mutated
to the perfect criminal.

55:23.500 --> 55:26.300
I have a brother?

55:26.380 --> 55:29.980
You were best friends at the Academy.
Star pupils.

55:29.980 --> 55:34.100
And then he turned.
And for his crimes, you judged him.

55:36.380 --> 55:38.580
Rico?

55:40.100 --> 55:41.780
Rico.

55:43.180 --> 55:47.700
You let me judge my own brother?
You never told me, sir.

55:47.780 --> 55:50.580
I couldn't!

55:53.980 --> 55:56.180
You were like a son to me!

55:56.340 --> 55:59.540
A son.

55:59.620 --> 56:03.420
My whole life is a lie.

56:03.540 --> 56:08.140
Rico had to be executed to protect you,
to protect the city.

56:08.220 --> 56:10.620
Rico.

56:11.940 --> 56:15.740
Rico. He's alive!

56:15.820 --> 56:20.220
No.
I signed the order myself.

56:20.220 --> 56:23.140
- I saw the report.
- I didn't kill Hammond.

56:23.140 --> 56:27.820
It was him. It was his D.N.A.
That convicted me.

56:27.940 --> 56:30.420
Griffin. Hmph.
It was Griffin.

56:30.420 --> 56:32.220
Griffin, yes.

56:32.340 --> 56:35.940
We've both been deceived, Joseph.
I'm so sorry.

56:36.020 --> 56:39.620
Rico's killed me
and destroyed you!

56:39.740 --> 56:43.020
Fi... find him,
joseph.

56:43.020 --> 56:46.220
Don't die.

57:29.380 --> 57:31.460
What do we do?

57:33.780 --> 57:36.180
What do we do?

57:36.260 --> 57:37.860
Find Rico.

57:44.260 --> 57:45.660
Welcome to Janus.

57:48.380 --> 57:51.180
Rico, I think you know
Dr. Hayden.

57:51.260 --> 57:55.860
I remember you. Testified before
the Council that I was insane, right?

57:55.980 --> 57:59.660
- And therefore innocent.
- I was trying to save your life.

57:59.660 --> 58:03.060
What you did was insult me,
'cause I knew exactly what I was doing.

58:03.060 --> 58:05.460
Then and now.

58:18.260 --> 58:21.780
Miss Hayden has been a loyal supporter
of this project for a long time.

58:21.860 --> 58:26.380
She's kept it alive for me. I'm sure
you'll find her expertise invaluable.

58:26.460 --> 58:31.060
Excuse me! All this is useless if you
can't get into Central's Janus files,

58:31.260 --> 58:33.260
'cause the Council
has 'em locked.

58:33.260 --> 58:37.900
Leave that to me. Meanwhile you
have work to do... on the streets.

58:38.020 --> 58:40.900
- Ilsa will help you.
- I don't need no help! Thanks.

58:42.620 --> 58:47.300
I thought you said he was created here
by the finest scientists of Mega City.

58:47.300 --> 58:49.620
A bold experiment.

58:51.700 --> 58:53.500
He's a petulant child.

58:53.620 --> 58:57.500
Let's not bicker.
We're here to achieve the same thing.

58:58.900 --> 59:00.500
An ordered society.

59:03.420 --> 59:06.220
You'll have
your New Order.

59:07.700 --> 59:11.500
Attention, all Judges.
Reporting unrest, code D-924.

59:11.500 --> 59:14.500
Downtown, Sector 12.
Backup requested.

59:29.700 --> 59:32.900
Nineteen different
explosions in 11 different sectors.

59:32.900 --> 59:37.100
Extra caution to be taken
on approach to 914...

59:41.100 --> 59:43.700
Search all areas
bordering the Elite Building.

59:43.820 --> 59:48.100
The anonymous caller did not
specify capacity. Proceed with caution.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:10.060
My boy!

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.740
Dredd, there's no way in!

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:22.340
Hello?
Are you even listening to me?

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:26.340
We can't just knock on the wall
and say, "hello, cursed earth pizza."

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.540
There is a way in.

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:31.340
Six years ago,
two refugees figured it out.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:35.260
It's a vent to the city's incinerator.
There's a burst twice a minute.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.140
That means somebody
could run through that tube...

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.740
and have 30 seconds
before it flames again.

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:44.860
And these, these refugees,
they made it through, right?

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.540
Actually,
they were roasted.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:50.540
But the theory's sound.
Shall we?

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.940
Maybe we should
consider other theories. Dredd!

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.540
Dispatch, I'm in Green Quad 411.
Need a pickup.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:03.740
Copy, Hershey.
I have Central on-line for you.

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.140
Patch it to my Lawmaster.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.300
Warning.
Alien device on board.

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.700
Oh, my God!

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.500
Latest casualty report:
96 Judges have been assassinated!

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.100
Whoever's doing this seems
to know all our procedures,

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.380
our security measures,
even our scrambled frequencies.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.580
With no Judges on the street, riots
are breaking out all over Mega City.

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.780
We can't replace those Judges.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:38.180
Even if we put the cadets on the street,
we won't be at full strength for years!

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.300
There is a solution.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.180
Project Janus.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.780
This Council tried to play God
once before.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.380
If this wholesale slaughter of Judges
continues, there won't be a Council.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.500
- Janus could...
- Janus could what?

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.380
A new batch of test-tube babies
won't solve this crisis.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.780
We don't need reliable Judges
20 years from now, we need them today!

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.980
Accelerated growth incubators
are more developed now.

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:10.300
We could create adult subjects.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.180
All I'm asking is that
we unlock the Janus files.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.900
That way we at least
have an option!

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.980
If the Council decides
not to go forward,

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:25.580
I'll accept that decision...
and resign.

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.020
- All right, you ready, kid?
- No!

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.820
- Now what's wrong?
- What's wrong? Are you kidding?

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.820
Did wearing that helmet all those years
compress your brain?

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.220
- You're gonna get me killed.
- There's a maniac loose in this city!

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.420
What a coincidence!

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.340
- There's one out here too!
- Oh.

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.820
Great time I'm having. The shuttle
crash, the Cursed Earth, cannibals.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.140
And now a fireball up my ass!

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.020
- This is all your fault!
- My fault?

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.140
- Yes!
- You care to explain that, citizen?

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:03.420
If you hadn't arrested me,
I wouldn't be here in the first place.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.940
Hey, Dredd, what if
you just kill me now?

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.540
That's it!
I'm through schlepping.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:15.220
I'm gonna stay here until
I'm caught or 'til you apologize!

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:19.220
- The Law can't apologize!
- You're not the Law anymore.

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.220
Now apologize.
I think I deserve that.

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.420
I've never apologized.

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:32.420
Now run!

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:35.140
Thirty, twenty-nine,
twenty-eight,

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.540
- twenty-seven, twenty-six,
- Run!

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:41.340
Twenty-five, twenty-four,
twenty-three, twenty-two,

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.620
twenty-one, nineteen...

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.820
Dredd? Dredd!

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:51.540
Dredd!
I don't wanna die!

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.260
Jump!

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.660
I'm alive!

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:18.380
I'm alive!

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:21.380
Oh... so are you.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.380
Esposito, Carlos.
Council Judge.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.980
Authorize access to file,
code name Janus.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.460
Acknowledged.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.460
McGruder, Evelyn. Authorize
access to file, code name Janus.

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.580
Acknowledged.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.460
Silver, Gerald.

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.260
Authorize access to file,
code name Janus.

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.460
Removing security blocks now.

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:52.860
Awaiting password command
from presiding Chief Justice.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.180
Password, origin.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.780
Janus file opened.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.260
Attention.
Ntil emergency repairs are completed,

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:07.380
ward "c" locker room
is off limits.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.980
Psst.

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.300
I'm lost.
Is this the bathroom?

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:14.500
Hey!

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.420
Now you have to admit,
I helped out on that one.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.220
I mean,
that was all me, baby!

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.100
Hey, hey, wh...
why are you taking off his clothes?

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.620
We don't have time
for this.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:33.900
Central,
using current technology,

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:38.220
how long would it take for Janus to
produce a fully-grown adult subject?

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.020
Given the current state
of genetic engineering,

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.500
an adult subject could be incubated
in approximately eight hours.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.900
- We could replace our losses in a day.
- This is madness.

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.700
Ah, Dredd?

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.620
- Silence.
- Dredd!

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.220
Shh. I'm busy.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.700
Dredd?

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.900
It's inhuman.
It's not for this Council to play God!

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:06.100
No, Griffin.
Please restore the security blocks.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:11.500
It seems none of you have the force
of will that these times require.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.700
Central,
leave Janus unlocked.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.420
Griffin, this is treason.
You have just sealed your fate.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.220
No!

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:23.820
You have just sealed yours!
Rico!

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.460
Now who says
politics is boring?

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:42.140
- Hey, Dredd! I thought it was you.

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.340
That's right!
Cover your ears!

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:51.660
- Rico.
- Joseph.

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.940
Get out of here... now!

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.340
No!

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.940
- You're under arrest, Griffin.
- Really?

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:19.260
Stop him! He just killed
the entire Council!

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:22.540
- Move it out!
- Dredd, tell them I'm innocent.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:39.740
Come on, Fergie!
Run!

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:42.660
You're a lot of fun to be with, Dredd.
You know that?

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:52.380
- What are you gonna do?
- Hope it works.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.580
What is wrong
with this piece of shit?

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:08.580
That's a solid brick wall!
You're going to kill us!

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:19.300
Dredd!
You gotta make it work!

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.979
Make it work!

01:08:20.979 --> 01:08:23.899
Malfunction.
Malfunction. On-line.

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:33.300
Dredd, you may want to wash this seat
after we get off the bike.

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:35.899
- Hmm.
- Sorry.

01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:41.899
Dredd, move it!

01:08:56.779 --> 01:08:59.380
- Fergie, cover the rear.
- I've never fired a gun in my life!

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.779
- What kind of a criminal are you?
- A nice criminal.

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:09.220
- Nothing's happening!
- You gotta cock it first, moron.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.220
You didn't say anything
about cocking.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.620
Nice!

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:28.140
Stop! Please, God!

01:09:42.939 --> 01:09:45.620
You can drop me off here.

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.819
- Dredd, that's a dead end.
- I know.

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.420
Oh, God!

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.940
Fergie, take over!

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.140
Where are you going?
Dredd!

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.060
- This is where you get off, creep!

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.380
- Need a lift, kid?

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.980
I'm never riding
with you again, Dredd!

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:00.180
She's definitely not gonna get her
cleaning deposit back, that's for sure.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:06.780
It doesn't pay to be
one of your friends, Dredd. Sorry!

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.980
Hands against the wall.
You know the drill.

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.380
- Who are you?
- Dredd said that...

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.380
Shut up!

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.860
- What happened?
- Why don't you tell me, Dredd, huh?

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:34.260
We're dyin' out there!
108 Judges in 48 hours!

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:37.460
What the hell is going on?

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.060
You think I'm part of this?

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:42.260
I don't know
who or what you are anymore.

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:52.300
I would never do anything
to hurt you, Hersh.

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:55.220
You know that.

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.700
All right.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.420
You tell me about him,
huh?

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.020
You make me believe in you
like I did when I defended you.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.220
His name is Rico...

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.500
and he's my brother.

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:17.700
The D.N.A. Sample
has been taken out of frozen stasis.

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:22.900
- Ready for cloning process.
- We got a slight change of plans here.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:26.300
I want to take the existing
D.N.A. Sample right now and trash it.

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:30.300
Activate this
D.N.A. Sampling console.

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:32.820
What are you doing?

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:37.620
Central, take...
this D.N.A. Sample now.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.700
This wasn't part
of our plan!

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:42.100
Judge Griffin would never
have authorized this!

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.500
Processing.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:47.300
You know, Griffin got to be my keeper
by puttin' me behind bars.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.300
What's your excuse?

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:58.700
You said I had no feelings
and no emotions.

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.700
Now you know why.

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:04.220
Dredd... look at me.

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:10.940
The Janus project didn't do that to you.
You did that to yourself.

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.540
Sorry, guys, I'm getting
nowhere with your terminal.

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:17.940
But I fixed the microwave.
You want some popcorn?

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.340
Is this a bad time?

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:25.140
Look, I tried dialing everything I
could think of to find this Janus thing.

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:28.660
It just isn't in the program.
Nowhere. Nothing.

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:31.460
They'd never take a chance and
put it on the computer network...

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.860
but they need power and they're
gonna steal it from somewhere.

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:36.860
Check every sector for recent blackouts
and sudden power surges.

01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:38.860
- Great. Let's stay here longer!
- Wait a second.

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.540
Just before they blew up
my Lawmaster in Sector Four,

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:46.140
there was a power surge,
a really big one, three blocks wide.

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.940
The last time I felt
something like that,

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.460
they shut down the whole power grid
in that area, remember?

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.740
When they moved the Statue of Liberty,
they put it right down on top of it.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.940
- Right.
- Could we go now?

01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:59.060
Dredd...
that's twice you owe me.

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:07.140
Rico! Dredd got away
from the hunters.

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:10.060
Well, he's about to be
seriously outnumbered.

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.940
- Right, Central?
- Affirmative, Judge Rico.

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.260
The new D.N.A. Sample
has been multiplexed,

01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.340
and the gametes
are already dividing.

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.060
New sample?

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.340
You left that D.N.A.
In there for over 30 years!

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.660
Sooner or later, somebody's
gonna clean out the fridge.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:28.180
That sample was created from the finest
specimens on the Council of Judges!

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.700
What did you
replace it with?

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.380
No. My God.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:37.700
You should congratulate me right now,
'cause I'm about to be a daddy.

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.900
You're being
very, very rude.

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.780
You don't know
what you're doing!

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:45.700
The next batch of Janus Judges are not
going to be the puppets that you want!

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:48.980
They're gonna be my brothers
and sisters! And mine to control!

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:52.580
I can't let you do this.
You're both insane! I have to stop...

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:02.100
Central... help me!

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:04.500
I'm sorry, Chief Justice,
the A.B.C. Robot...

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.900
is not tied
into my main processor.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:10.380
That's right, Griff. You gotta
get with this high-tech stuff.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.900
- Robot, rip his arms and legs off.
- No!

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:16.900
And you save his head for last.
I don't want him to miss anything!

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.900
- Anything!
- No!

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.380
- Fergie, you stay here.
- By myself?

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.500
You'll need me to shut down
the Janus system. We're a team.

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:31.180
Granted, you do most of the work,
but we're still a team.

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.580
- I'll handle it, kid.
- I bring you luck.

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:37.100
- Luck?
- You are still alive, Dredd.

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.900
Hmm.

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:56.740
- I'm getting a signal.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.220
It's close.
It's moving closer!

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:04.820
Jesus Christ!

01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:07.140
Get back!

01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.620
No!

01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:16.020
Dredd!

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:24.420
Drop the gun.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:29.220
Robot, on the count of three,
break her neck.

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.740
One, two...

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.020
No!

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:41.620
- Hershey?
- I'm still here.

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:46.220
- How romantic. Step inside.

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:56.740
He looks a lot like you.

01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.340
He looks a lot like you.

01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.220
He is a lot like me.

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.980
I am nothing like you.

01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.820
The only difference
between us, Joseph,

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.260
is you destroyed your life...
to embrace the Law.

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.980
And I destroyed the Law...
to embrace life.

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:18.780
And speaking of life,
send in the clones.

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.260
Behold!

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:43.380
This is where you were born.

01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.260
Feel that magic?

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:49.860
But you must've known
all along...

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.780
you were different.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:59.460
Fergie...
are you still alive?

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:02.980
Technically... yes.

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:10.580
Your brothers
and your sisters.

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.580
Be born in two hours.

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:16.860
One big, endless supply
of perfection.

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:21.060
You know, we have a choice.
We can stand here right now...

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:25.220
and create a whole race of brainwashed
morons, and call them Judges.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.700
Or we can create
some freethinking people.

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.620
We'll call them human.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:35.020
Human.

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:40.220
You could never
control yourself.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.700
What makes you think you
can control... these things?

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:47.020
'Cause you're in control.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.420
You be head
of the Council.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:53.620
You choose,
and you choose quickly too.

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:58.220
I should've put you down myself...
personally!

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.020
You know,
I never understood that.

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:05.020
Why did you judge me?
Why did you judge me?

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.020
- You killed innocent people.
- The means to an end.

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.020
- You started a massacre.
- I caused a revolution.

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:12.020
- You betrayed the Law!
- Law!

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:14.820
I betrayed this!

01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:19.700
Your Council's experiment,
which failed in you!

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:22.220
I was your brother,
your blood, your friend.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.700
Who betrayed who?

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:28.900
When are you gonna stop
being a goddamn slave and grow up?

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.820
That's your birthright,
that's your family.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:34.220
I'm your family.
I'm the only family you ever had!

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.500
Now choose!

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:44.540
The best thing you can do
is kill me.

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:46.460
Why?

01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:51.660
Because it's
your only chance... brother.

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.540
Fido!

01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.660
Rip this bitch's arms
and legs off.

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:02.140
- Save her pretty head for my brother.
- Don't do it!

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:04.060
Halt!

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:08.540
Rip his head off instead.
Give it to her.

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.540
What's the matter with you?

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.540
Rico!

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:22.060
- Boy, is he pissed!
- Fergie!

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:27.940
Dredd!

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.740
- Get him, Dredd!
- Hang on, Fergie.

01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:37.060
Hack you, asshole.

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.340
Rico!

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.540
Central, hatch that
first set of clones.

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.540
The cloning process
is not finished, Judge Rico.

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.940
The clones will be
only 60Â°/o complete.

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:52.740
I need reinforcements.
Hatch the goddamn clones now!

01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:06.780
Don't fight much,
do you?

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:45.580
Bitch!

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.580
It's Judge Bitch!

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:36.540
I'm the only one
who never lied to you.

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:39.540
I'll be the judge of that.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:07.540
Now, Joseph Dredd,
I hereby judge you.

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:14.060
To the charge of betraying
your flesh... guilty.

01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:19.860
To the charge of being human, when
we could have been Gods... guilty.

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:22.660
The sentence is death.

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.260
Don't miss.

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.820
Lethal round is exhausted.

01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:33.260
Signal flare!

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.660
Court is adjourned.

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:52.260
Dredd.

01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:09.700
Give me your hand.

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:12.900
That's three times now, Dredd.

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:26.500
Stay in back, Hershey.

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:33.700
- Am I under arrest?
- That won't be necessary.

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:36.900
Central broadcast the Janus plan
after Griffin's death.

01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:39.100
They all know the truth.

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:42.500
Judge Dredd, we have
to reconstitute the Council.

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:47.580
We'd like you to consider
the first position of Chief Justice.

01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:49.900
I'm a Street Judge.

01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:53.100
And I'm very late for work.
Thank you, Olmeyer.

01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:57.700
I am dying.
I'm too young... excuse me.

01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:00.340
Oh, that's great!
He gets all the credit.

01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:02.140
Dredd?

01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:04.140
I taught him everything he knows.

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:07.540
Dredd, that's it?

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:10.340
No good-bye?

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:12.540
Good-bye, Hershey.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:23.100
To tell you the truth,
I'm probably a much better kisser.

01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:26.740
Ow! Okay, come on, let's go, will ya?
Can we swing by a cash machine?

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:38.540
Feels good to be human,
don't you think?

01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:42.940
I knew you'd say that.
