WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:03.035
ADULT ADAM: <i> The '80s gave us</i>
<i> the multiplex...</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:05.404
<i> 10 glorious movies</i>
<i> under one roof,</i>

00:05.406 --> 00:07.039
<i> a heaven where you could</i>
<i> literally spend</i>

00:07.041 --> 00:10.642
<i> a whole day inside,</i>
<i> delighting in mystery, action,</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:11.710
<i> and some of the greatest films</i>
<i> ever made.</i>

00:11.712 --> 00:14.480
One for <i> ET.</i>
One for <i> Indiana Jones,</i>
please.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.547
One ticket for <i> Mannequin.</i>

00:15.549 --> 00:16.915
One for <i> The Lost Boys,</i>
please.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.384
One for <i> Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

00:18.386 --> 00:22.054
They put sunglasses
on a corpse. (CHUCKLES)

00:22.223 --> 00:24.790
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And then a movie came along</i>
<i> that changed everything</i>

00:24.792 --> 00:28.127
<i> for countless young men</i>
<i> on the verge of adulthood.</i>

00:28.129 --> 00:30.763
<i> Porky's!</i> Oh, yes!

00:31.065 --> 00:31.663
Hell, no!

00:31.665 --> 00:35.034
Do you realize that movie is
packed with potty language,

00:35.036 --> 00:38.370
adult situations,
and Florida attitude?

00:38.372 --> 00:39.671
Yeah. That's why
I want to see it.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.974
Not with those beautiful
and innocent eyes.

00:41.976 --> 00:44.610
One's kind of wonky.
The other one's all right.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.378
Point is, no <i> Porky's.</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:48.647
It's rated R,
and you need my permission,

00:48.649 --> 00:49.915
which I will never,
ever, ever give.

00:49.917 --> 00:53.385
Well, in a few years,
I won't even need
your permission.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.153
I'll just rent it on Beta.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.588
Well, not if I contact
every video store
in the state.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.756
Well, I'll legally
change my name.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.224
Well, then I'll do
a mass mailing
for your photo.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.294
Well, then I'll have
extensive plastic surgery
and change my face.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.229
Well, then I'll hire
the A-Team

01:04.231 --> 01:05.330
to capture you
and bring you home.

01:05.332 --> 01:06.465
Well, then
I'll hire Delta Force

01:06.467 --> 01:08.534
to combat
your precious A-Team.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.202
What's going on
with you two?

01:10.204 --> 01:12.638
What's going on is,
you're a good boy.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.909
And if I say that movie
isn't appropriate,
then you'll listen.

01:17.011 --> 01:20.145
(GASPS)
What about <i> Annie,</i> huh?

01:20.147 --> 01:21.947
I hear you singing
it's a hard-knock life.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.683
Every morning when you make
your poopalas.

01:24.685 --> 01:25.918
ADULT ADAM:
<i> But my mom was</i>
<i> on to something.</i>

01:25.920 --> 01:28.821
<i> That little redhead</i>
<i> would be our perfect cover.</i>

01:28.823 --> 01:30.589
Okay. Just got our
<i> Annie</i> tickets.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.691
Now all we got to do
is sneak into <i> Porky's.</i>

01:32.693 --> 01:35.828
This is it. The last time
we'll see each other as boys.

01:35.830 --> 01:39.131
Bear witness to the end
of my innocence, bro.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.468
Okay, no one panic,
but I'm like 99.9% sure

01:42.470 --> 01:44.736
that ticket guy
is on to us!

01:45.873 --> 01:47.172
You're freaking out.

01:47.174 --> 01:47.806
I am not!

01:47.808 --> 01:49.374
Then why is your voice
all high and squeaky?

01:49.376 --> 01:50.776
That's just
how I sound now.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.744
Stop yapping
and come on already.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.146
Wait!
We missed the first minute!

01:54.148 --> 01:56.381
All the naughty stuff
will be way less enjoyable

01:56.383 --> 01:59.485
if we don't understand
how it fits into the story!

02:00.454 --> 02:02.054
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was one of those moments</i>

02:02.056 --> 02:03.922
<i> that show you</i>
<i> what you're made of.</i>

02:03.924 --> 02:06.792
<i> Was I gonna stay</i>
<i> a scared little boy,</i>

02:06.794 --> 02:09.394
<i> or would I become a man?</i>

02:10.431 --> 02:13.499
No, Annie!
There's no way to go but up.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.100
How is this not rated R?

02:15.102 --> 02:17.035
This wasn't
in the stage production.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.838
I was not prepared for this.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.508
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:22.510 --> 02:27.880
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:28.582 --> 02:29.581
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:29.583 --> 02:33.519
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:33.521 --> 02:36.054
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was February 10,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:36.056 --> 02:38.557
<i> and Valentine's Day</i>
<i> was right around the corner.</i>

02:38.559 --> 02:41.260
Barry, you know I love you,
but please don't be an idiot

02:41.262 --> 02:42.528
and go crazy
on Valentine's Day.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.395
I mean it.
What?

02:43.397 --> 02:45.898
All I asked was if there
was anywhere to park

02:45.900 --> 02:47.733
a hot-air balloon
on your property.

02:47.735 --> 02:48.400
I'm serious.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.068
I'm not one of those girls
who likes

02:50.070 --> 02:52.137
big public displays
of affection.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.438
Just keep it small, okay?

02:53.440 --> 02:55.507
ADULT ADAM: <i> Back then,</i>
<i> keeping it small meant</i>

02:55.509 --> 02:58.343
<i> my brother's only option</i>
<i> was the Love-A-Gram.</i>

02:58.345 --> 02:59.678
<i> It made the cool kids</i>
<i> feel cooler</i>

02:59.680 --> 03:01.013
<i> and the lonely goobers</i>
<i> feel even lonelier.</i>

03:01.015 --> 03:06.285
Hey, uh, I'd like
to send a flower to
chemistry class for,

03:06.287 --> 03:07.619
um (CHUCKLES)

03:07.621 --> 03:08.554
Yourself?

03:08.556 --> 03:12.090
It's okay, Naked Rob.
You'll find love one day.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.358
Hey, man.
How you doing?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.793
Uh, I'm fine.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.129
Gah! You're always,
like, right there.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.131
Enough already. Okay?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.801
Look, just do what
every high-school boy
on the planet does.

03:22.803 --> 03:23.769
Get her flowers.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.404
You want me to get
Lainey flowers?

03:25.406 --> 03:28.240
They're nature's trash!
They don't even do anything.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.376
Trust me.
Every girl loves roses.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.445
(SINGSONG VOICE)
Erica Goldberg!

03:33.447 --> 03:35.581
I got roses for you!

03:35.583 --> 03:36.615
Crap. Why?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.550
Don't you just love
V-Day?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.051
Ooh! Here.

03:39.053 --> 03:42.087
I got 100 roses
from your secret admirer.

03:42.089 --> 03:45.190
100? Come on, man!

03:45.326 --> 03:47.526
How mysterious
and sexy.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.794
Not to mention
bulky and unwieldy.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.964
Who knows? Maybe today,
your secret admirer will
reveal himself

03:51.966 --> 03:54.766
and you'll realize that
love was under your nose
the whole time.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.102
Or I tell him that I have
no feelings for him at all

03:57.104 --> 03:59.004
and we shake hands
and go our separate ways.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.673
Or you kiss him 'cause
you realize you're soul mates.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.108
Or I knee him
in the coin purse

04:03.110 --> 04:06.011
because now
he's getting creepy.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.413
(SIGHS) I was so close.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.148
Were you, though?

04:10.417 --> 04:12.150
ADULT ADAM: <i> While Erica</i>
<i> was breaking hearts,</i>

04:12.152 --> 04:14.786
<i> my friends were bragging about</i>
<i> breaking in to</i> Porky's.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.956
I feel like <i> Porky's</i> graphic
adult content wasn't blatant.

04:17.958 --> 04:18.824
It was earned, you know?

04:18.826 --> 04:21.727
I feel like, at its core,
it was a story of friendship.

04:21.729 --> 04:22.561
Mmm.
And boobs.

04:22.563 --> 04:26.531
(CHUCKLES) Not to be this guy,
but Kim Cattrall is so hot.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.734
Psst!
Know who's even hotter?

04:28.736 --> 04:29.835
Miss Hannigan from <i> Annie.</i>

04:29.837 --> 04:31.770
I mean,
not in a conventional way,

04:31.772 --> 04:33.739
but there's
something there.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.274
This is just sad, pal.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.074
MURRAY: I can't believe it.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.911
The boy saw <i> Annie</i>
Instead of <i> Porky's.</i>

04:39.913 --> 04:42.147
My lord,
you raised a wuss.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.715
Me? He's your son!

04:43.717 --> 04:47.019
I take a casual, non-committal
approach to parenting.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.587
You're the one
in the trenches.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.723
He's not a wuss.
He's a good boy.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.557
Too good!

04:52.559 --> 04:54.326
Now's the time
for taking chances

04:54.328 --> 04:56.228
and spreading
his wings a bit.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.363
Would you rather
take over?

04:58.365 --> 04:59.431
Let's not get crazy.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.933
How about that scene in gym
class with Ms. Balbricker?

05:01.935 --> 05:03.669
That was crazy!
(LAUGHS) Yes!

05:03.671 --> 05:07.105
You want to talk crazy,
Carol Burnett.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.874
She acts, sings,
and dances.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.742
She's a Swiss army knife
of entertainment.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.512
Okay, yeah. That was
full wuss right there.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.746
ADULT ADAM:
<i> So, I wasn't a bad boy.</i>

05:14.748 --> 05:18.483
<i> But at least my girlfriend</i>
<i> always appreciated</i>
<i> my sensitive side.</i>

05:18.485 --> 05:21.019
Geez, I wish I was gonna
see you on Valentine's Day.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.889
You know what's just as good
as me going to Seattle?

05:23.891 --> 05:25.824
A 10-minute phone date
where we eat the same pasta

05:25.826 --> 05:27.125
and watch the same episode
of <i> Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

05:27.127 --> 05:31.396
It's really not.
(AS ARNOLD JACKSON)
Whatchu talkin' 'bout, Dana?

05:32.032 --> 05:32.864
(TIMER DINGS)

05:32.866 --> 05:34.299
(NORMAL VOICE)
Dang it. That's time.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.634
Aw.
Just a few more minutes?

05:35.636 --> 05:38.070
I can't.
You know how crazy
my parents get

05:38.072 --> 05:40.305
about the
long-distance bills.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.973
It's, like, a huge rule.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.543
Some rules
are made to be broken.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.379
What the hell
was that about?

05:47.381 --> 05:50.382
I think he's saying
you can break the rule
and we can keep talking.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.117
No way.
He's bluffing.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.985
Not bluffing.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.555
What kind of crazy
mind game is this?

05:56.557 --> 05:57.789
Maybe it's not a game.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.024
Oh, it's a game.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.025
Not a game.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.193
He said it's not a game.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.594
It's worse!
It's a trap!

06:02.596 --> 06:03.495
It's not a damn trap!

06:03.497 --> 06:06.098
It's a trap,
and I'm gonna hang up
and win!

06:06.100 --> 06:08.066
But he said...
(DIAL TONE)

06:09.136 --> 06:10.402
My God.
What are you doing?

06:10.404 --> 06:12.437
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

06:12.439 --> 06:13.605
Get out of my head, man!

06:13.607 --> 06:15.474
Adam, you're a good kid.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.441
But sometimes,
you got to take a risk,

06:16.443 --> 06:20.345
like breaking the phone rule
or going to see <i> Porky's.</i>

06:20.347 --> 06:20.679
Shh!

06:20.681 --> 06:22.848
Don't say the "P" word
when the "M" word is around.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.250
My point is
seeing an R-rated movie,

06:25.252 --> 06:27.486
that might be a rule
that's okay to break.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.687
Hey, I break
plenty of rules,

06:28.689 --> 06:29.955
jaywalking,
I once ran with scissors.

06:29.957 --> 06:33.592
They were safety scissors,
and I lied about
the jaywalking.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.361
So lying!
Lying is on the list now.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.095
Okay. That's it.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.431
Tomorrow, I'm taking you
to see <i> Porky's.</i>

06:39.433 --> 06:40.532
What about mom?

06:40.534 --> 06:41.299
She'll never find out.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.235
What's going on in here?
<i> Porky's!</i>

06:43.237 --> 06:44.169
What?
<i> Porky's!</i>

06:44.171 --> 06:47.839
Pork and beans.
The boy wants pork
and beans for dinner.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.642
It's tuna taco Tuesday.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.944
But, I can
move some things around.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.181
Good suggestion,
my little angel.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.750
Boy, you're really
not good at this.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.820
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While I was being forced</i>
<i> to break the rules...</i>

07:01.822 --> 07:03.155
Psst! Hey, dummy!

07:03.157 --> 07:06.091
(LAUGHS) You looked!
Means you're a dummy.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.860
But seriously,
I need your help
and advice. Come on.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.829
ADULT ADAM: <i> Erica was about</i>
<i> to discover</i>

07:10.831 --> 07:13.165
<i> that Barry broke into</i>
<i> the AV. Club room.</i>

07:13.167 --> 07:15.400
Okay, I know you told me
to buy Lainey flowers,

07:15.402 --> 07:18.103
but that's just
too small a gift
for the love of my life.

07:18.105 --> 07:22.274
Luckily, I figured out
the perfect Valentine's gift
to get her.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.375
A new boyfriend?
Burn!

07:23.377 --> 07:26.311
I don't agree
with your insult,
but I respect it.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.280
Anyway,
I was watching MTV,

07:28.282 --> 07:30.649
and this crazy genius video
popped up.

07:30.651 --> 07:34.719
And there it was,
the answer I was looking for.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.156
<i> ¶ Hello</i>

07:38.158 --> 07:39.658
Hello?
How is this the answer?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.293
<i> ¶ Is It Me You're</i>
<i> Looking For? ¶</i>
Lainey loves Lionel.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.629
And this video right here
is the most romantic story
ever told.

07:44.631 --> 07:48.600
Granted, Lionel is cool
and can pull off
a striped sweater,

07:48.602 --> 07:50.068
but this whole video is,
like, super weird.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.839
ADULT ADAM:
<i> 33 years before Adele,</i>
<i> this was the</i> "Hello",

07:53.841 --> 07:58.143
<i> that took the world by storm</i>
<i> thanks to Lionel Richie.</i>

07:58.512 --> 07:59.344
He's in love
with a blind girl.

07:59.346 --> 08:02.614
He follows her
through the halls,
and she has no idea.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.949
It's so romantic.
Is it?

08:03.951 --> 08:06.251
Yes!
And she loves him, too!

08:06.253 --> 08:08.920
Just look at the sculpture
she made of his face.

08:08.922 --> 08:09.821
It's scary but sincere.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.958
What does this have to do with
Valentine's Day or anything?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.160
Duh! I'm gonna be
just like the video

08:15.162 --> 08:17.128
and make Lainey
a clay bust.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.832

08:20.834 --> 08:22.300

<i> This is how I see you.</i>

08:22.302 --> 08:24.202
The point is,
stop while you're ahead.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.938
Trust me.
Girls don't like it
when a guy tries too hard.

08:26.940 --> 08:31.142
What up, what up?
Guess who's all about
VD today.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.244
Wait.
That sounded really bad.

08:32.246 --> 08:33.612
I've got math class, Geoff.
What do you need?

08:33.614 --> 08:37.048
Me? Nothing.
Just thought you'd need
something from your locker.

08:37.050 --> 08:37.482
Nope.

08:37.484 --> 08:40.151
Well, maybe just check
to see that everything's okay.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.553
Why wouldn't it be okay?

08:41.555 --> 08:43.054
Just open it!

Someone must like you.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.864
Dear Lord! They pooped
all over my stuff!

08:52.866 --> 08:56.935
It's like a bottle of
Elmer's glue exploded
in there.

08:56.937 --> 08:57.903
Geoff, this has to stop.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.038
Don't worry.
I'll go get some
paper towels.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.440
Geoff to the rescue.
I'm such a good guy.

ADULT ADAM: <i> While Erica</i>

All right, son.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.284
Now's your chance
to go see your jiggle movie.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.686
What?
Aren't you coming with me?

09:14.688 --> 09:16.321
Who's gonna buy me
a ticket?

09:16.323 --> 09:18.256
That would defeat
the whole purpose!

09:18.258 --> 09:19.357
You got to do this
on your own.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.959
You buy a ticket
for <i> Annie,</i>

09:20.961 --> 09:23.194
and then you sneak
into <i> Porky's.</i>

09:23.196 --> 09:24.095
Easy-peasy.

09:24.097 --> 09:24.763
But I just saw <i> Annie.</i>

09:24.765 --> 09:29.134
You think they'll believe
I'd see that garbage
twice in a week?

(DOOR SQUEAKING)

09:33.006 --> 09:34.673
Even better.
Now it's free.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.909
Now you're telling me
to cheat the theater
out of the price of a ticket?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.578
All right. That's it.
I've had enough.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.680
You go see that movie now
or you're punished.

09:41.682 --> 09:45.483
What? You can't punish me
for not breaking the rules!

09:45.485 --> 09:46.017
Move it now!

09:46.019 --> 09:49.120
Fine!
But I'll never forgive you
for helping me get into

09:49.122 --> 09:51.690
the movie
I've been dying to see.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.737
Excuse me.
Pardon me, everyone.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.339
I hate to interrupt your smut,

10:07.341 --> 10:09.741
but my innocent little boy

10:09.743 --> 10:10.609

10:10.611 --> 10:12.510
I know you're in here,

A mother always knows.
Surrender!

10:15.849 --> 10:16.414
Oh, balls.

10:16.416 --> 10:20.185
I don't mean
to judge any of you,
but you're all terrible.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.220
Best of luck.

That was terror.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.173

Damn it! Okay.
I know what I got to do.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.194
See, the girl
in the video was blind.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.529
I've been looking at Lainey
with my eyes

11:04.531 --> 11:07.332
when I should really be
looking at her with my hands.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.501

Can we talk about us?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.541
There isn't an us.

And you're, like,

Cool. Cool.
So, I've come to a major
life decision. We're done.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.248
Sweet.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.083
You do realize
what that means.

Now you have
to just sit back

Well, live and learn.

Hey, hallways,
am I right?

11:40.300 --> 11:43.234
You broke my rules,
you broke my trust,

11:43.236 --> 11:44.669
and you broke my heart.

You can't do that.

11:55.382 --> 11:55.947

I'm not gonna
deny myself snuggies

11:57.684 --> 11:59.451

you love perverted cinema.

11:59.453 --> 12:03.154
We can snug,
but still, no Nintendo
and no telephone.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.522
But Sunday's
Valentine's Day.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.724
I have a whole phone date
planned with Dana.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.393

I'm angry,

15:50.450 --> 15:52.650
I mean, you could have gotten
a head cold and died!

15:52.652 --> 15:54.986
Dad said to break the rules,
so that's just what I did.

15:54.988 --> 15:59.257
I meant leave the seat up!
Eat a grape at the
supermarket!

15:59.259 --> 16:01.793
Not fly across
the damn country!

16:01.795 --> 16:02.927
But, deep down,
you're proud of me.

16:02.929 --> 16:05.063
No, I'm the opposite
of that.

16:05.065 --> 16:05.897
Gotcha. Mom's here,

16:05.899 --> 16:07.532
so you can't give me
the respect that I deserve.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.934
No respect!
You're a moron!

16:09.936 --> 16:12.203
Yep. I really am.

16:12.539 --> 16:13.504
You really are.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.940
Let's just all agree,
in the future,

16:15.942 --> 16:19.143
we leave the parenting
to me and Bev.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.511
Yes. For sure.

16:20.513 --> 16:20.979
Absolutely.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.247
Guys, guys,
I think the headline here

16:23.249 --> 16:24.716
is that I did the right thing
in the end.

16:24.718 --> 16:27.585
True.
I cried until they turned
that plane around.

16:27.587 --> 16:31.789
That was not easy
and cost me every bit
of my dignity.

16:31.791 --> 16:32.790
He did do that.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.558
And I did not try smoking,

16:33.560 --> 16:36.694
even though
the other passengers said
it would calm my nerves.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.730
You should
head upstairs now.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.732
Same goes for
the tiny vodka bottles.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.533
Head upstairs now.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.369
Everybody go!

16:44.771 --> 16:46.971
Well, I hope you're happy.
You've ruined our son.

16:46.973 --> 16:50.541
Adam used to be a good boy,
and now he's a real (BLEEP)

16:50.543 --> 16:51.809
I'm not gonna apologize
for that.

16:51.811 --> 16:55.279
Bevy, do you really
want to have the only kid
in the world

16:55.281 --> 16:58.216
who's afraid
to see an R-rated movie?

16:58.218 --> 16:59.150
Yes!

16:59.152 --> 17:00.385
That's the dream.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.185
Well, it's not mine.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.489
Look, I know I'm not
down in the trenches
like the two of you,

17:04.491 --> 17:06.724
but we need
to raise a man,

17:06.726 --> 17:09.560
one who's not afraid
to go out and take a risk,

17:09.562 --> 17:12.597
even if it means
disappointing us.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.606
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Valentine's Day had arrived,</i>

17:21.608 --> 17:24.776
<i> and Barry was finally ready</i>
<i> to unveil his masterpiece.</i>

17:24.778 --> 17:28.413
Dude, are you still in here
making Lainey heads?

17:28.415 --> 17:30.381
I'm so close, Erica!

17:30.383 --> 17:33.251
Come.
Prepare yourself for beauty.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.952
<i> ¶ Hello ¶</i>

17:34.954 --> 17:35.653
Oh, no!

17:35.655 --> 17:37.021
(MUSIC STOPS)
Okay. That's a no.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.856
Don't worry.
Got many more.

17:38.858 --> 17:39.991
Behold.

17:39.993 --> 17:40.725
<i> ¶ Hello ¶</i>

17:40.727 --> 17:42.160
(MUSIC STOPS)
Ew!

17:42.162 --> 17:44.195
Okay. Good note.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.430
Feast your eyes on this.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.899
<i> ¶ 'Cause You Know</i>
<i> Just what to say</i>

17:47.901 --> 17:49.667
I got one
you're gonna love.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.869
<i> ¶ And You Know Just What To Do</i>

17:51.871 --> 17:53.805
That's supposed to be
your girlfriend?

17:53.807 --> 17:58.109
<i> ¶ And I Want To Tell You</i>
<i> So much</i>

17:58.645 --> 17:59.710
<i> ¶ I Love You ¶</i>
No. Stop.

17:59.712 --> 18:03.614
(MUSIC STOPS)
You can't show Lainey any
of these clay monstrosities.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.950
She'll think
you're a serial killer.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.286
I know.
I blew it.

18:08.288 --> 18:12.790
I ruined the first Valentine's
with the girl of my dreams.

18:12.792 --> 18:13.491
Barry?

18:13.493 --> 18:15.293
Lainey! Lainey,
don't look at me, please,

18:15.295 --> 18:17.495
or anything else
in this room.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.730
Also,
happy Valentine's Day.

18:19.732 --> 18:20.231
What the...

18:20.233 --> 18:22.633
You made all this for me?
(CHUCKLES)

18:25.672 --> 18:26.370
So, you like them?

18:26.372 --> 18:28.739
Don't take this the wrong way,
but they're nightmares.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.575
This was supposed to be
your Valentine's gift.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.411
I just wanted to show
how I see you, but...

18:33.413 --> 18:36.981
It's just impossible to make
something as beautiful as you.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.684
Barry, I told you
not to go all crazy.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.319
I know, but the fact
that you love me

18:41.321 --> 18:45.089
more than any man in this
world is everything to me.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.925
It's everything.

18:47.927 --> 18:52.630
The fact that you'd sit
here for days and try
over and over...

18:53.433 --> 18:57.401
That's exactly
why I love you,
you big idiot.

18:57.403 --> 19:03.975
<i> ¶ I've Been Alone</i>
<i> With you inside my mind</i>

19:04.344 --> 19:11.582
<i> ¶ And In My Dreams,</i>
<i> I've Kissed Your lips</i>
<i> a thousand times</i>

19:11.584 --> 19:12.049
I saw that.

19:12.051 --> 19:19.223
<i> ¶ I Sometimes See You</i>
<i> Pass outside my door</i>
What? Ew. You saw nothing.

19:19.225 --> 19:19.891
Lights out.

19:19.893 --> 19:22.426
<i> ¶ Hello</i>
And mom says
no sneaking TV.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.327
Still punished. Got it.

19:23.329 --> 19:27.031
<i> ¶ Is It Me You're Looking For?</i>
I've got to say,
flying to Seattle?

19:27.033 --> 19:27.832
You really took
a big swing.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.969
<i> ¶ I Can See It In Your Eyes</i>
Don't worry.
I'll get the hang of it.

19:31.971 --> 19:35.406
<i> ¶ I Can See It In Your Smile</i>

19:35.408 --> 19:36.741
<i> ¶ You're All I've</i>
<i> Ever Wanted ¶</i>

19:36.743 --> 19:40.611
ADULT ADAM:
<i> That night, I decided to</i>
<i> start breaking the rules,</i>

19:40.613 --> 19:42.847
<i> but it wasn't because my dad</i>
<i> said to</i>

19:42.849 --> 19:45.683
<i> or because I thought</i>
<i> I would prove I was a man.</i>

19:45.685 --> 19:46.584
<i> I did it simply because</i>

19:46.586 --> 19:49.687
<i> I was a boy</i>
<i> in love with a girl.</i>

19:49.689 --> 19:51.923
<i> And after being in</i>
<i> such a hurry to grow up,</i>

19:51.925 --> 19:55.593
<i> in that moment,</i>
<i> I just wanted time to stop.</i>

19:55.595 --> 19:59.197
<i> And I was willing</i>
<i> to risk everything.</i>

20:02.602 --> 20:05.102
He snuck out to call Dana.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.306
Well, what do you know?

20:08.308 --> 20:09.874
You gonna bust him?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.108
Oh, for sure.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.710
But he's a good boy.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.613
I'll give him
a couple of minutes.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.553
<i> That's the thing about love.</i>

20:22.555 --> 20:26.524
<i> It makes you</i>
<i> want to take risks</i>
<i> and go out on a limb,</i>

20:26.526 --> 20:27.992
<i> no matter the consequence.</i>

20:27.994 --> 20:33.364
<i> But for the right person,</i>
<i> it's totally worth it.</i>

20:33.366 --> 20:36.067
<i> ¶ I Love You ¶</i>

20:38.471 --> 20:40.404
Ugh. Why is that
Lainey head here?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.907
They made me remove them all
from the school premises

20:42.909 --> 20:44.075
'cause they were scaring
the first graders.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.010
Me and the JTP
are gonna blow this one up
with some fireworks.

20:46.012 --> 20:50.715
Do it now.
I am not gonna sleep
with that thing in the house.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.350
Oh, my...

20:52.352 --> 20:54.685
I get it.
I suck at sculptering.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.386
No.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.888
Baby, you're a genius.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.424
And I am so honored
that this is how you see me.

21:00.426 --> 21:06.163
I mean, what a beautiful
tribute to the love
of your life...

21:07.900 --> 21:09.200
Me.

21:09.202 --> 21:09.600
Oh, no.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.270
Mom, just so you know,
this is actually a sculpture
of Lainey's head.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.071
Toss it in the trash.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.174
ADAM: <i> That's my stupid</i>
<i> brother right there.</i>

21:17.176 --> 21:19.710
<i> He's talking</i>
<i> with his girlfriend.</i>

21:21.247 --> 21:23.281
<i> What was that?</i>
