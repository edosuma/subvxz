00:03.319 --> 00:05.378
For over a century,
I have lived in secret.

00:05.555 --> 00:08.251
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.586
- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.923
- He told me about your ex, Katherine.
- You must be Elena.

00:14.097 --> 00:17.396
- How do we look exactly alike?
- I don't want you seeing Elena.

00:17.567 --> 00:21.230
If you don't remove her from your life,
I will kill everyone that she loves.

00:21.404 --> 00:23.235
The Lockwoods are werewolves.

00:23.406 --> 00:26.773
You have to trigger the curse.
Somebody has to die at your hands.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.969
- Tried to kill a werewolf. Failed.
- Now you made an enemy.

00:32.015 --> 00:33.607
Thank you, Mason. Let's do this.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.774
Each with a stake in the heart,
then burn them both.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.854
- Hi, Mom.
- Keep Caroline away from me, please.

00:40.023 --> 00:41.684
- She's your daughter.
- Not anymore.

00:41.858 --> 00:45.157
I'm just looking for this old piece
of my mom's. It's a moonstone.

00:45.328 --> 00:46.852
- Thank you.
- You got it.

00:47.030 --> 00:48.827
I got it.

01:00.110 --> 01:02.305
You're staring.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.503
I'm gazing.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.046
- It's creepy.
- It's romantic.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.179
- Hey.
- Mm.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.855
- Ahh, this is bad of us.
- Mm, yes, it is.

01:22.031 --> 01:25.831
- Lf Katherine finds out...
- Katherine who?

01:26.002 --> 01:27.264
- Ha, ha.
- Mm.

01:32.876 --> 01:34.605
Shh, shh, shh.

01:34.778 --> 01:37.838
Miss Flowers will think I'm a floozy
if I have a man in here.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.345
Why are you staying here?

01:39.516 --> 01:41.848
Because I like this bed and breakfast.
Don't you?

01:42.018 --> 01:43.508
- I love it.
- Mm.

01:48.091 --> 01:51.492
Mm. Okay, I, um...
I need to be in the shower.

01:51.661 --> 01:54.824
- Love it. Let's go.
- Ha, ha. No, just me.

01:54.998 --> 01:58.229
I'm late. I'm decorating
at the Lockwood charity thing.

01:58.401 --> 02:01.063
Well, what do you know? So am I.

02:01.237 --> 02:04.502
Do you think that's really a good idea
to be at their house today?

02:04.674 --> 02:06.608
Mason Lockwood tried to kill you.

02:14.017 --> 02:17.043
- Where's the moonstone?
- Somewhere safe.

02:17.887 --> 02:21.880
- Don't you trust me?
- I don't trust anyone.

02:22.058 --> 02:25.391
I don't trust Mason. I wanna be there
today to keep an eye on him.

02:25.962 --> 02:27.623
Okay.

02:28.398 --> 02:32.129
But then we can't touch or talk.
And no lingering stares.

02:32.335 --> 02:33.427
No, none of that.

02:36.706 --> 02:38.230
What do you think will happen...

02:38.408 --> 02:41.070
...if Katherine finds out
that we were fake fighting?

02:41.244 --> 02:43.007
<i>You scared I'm gonna kill you?</i>

02:43.179 --> 02:46.239
- No. You won't.
- Mm.

02:48.084 --> 02:52.214
- Ow. Kath. Easy.
- Did I hurt you? Sorry.

02:53.623 --> 02:54.647
Ow.

02:54.824 --> 02:58.157
- Did it hurt?
- It's okay.

02:58.361 --> 03:01.421
A little bit every day
to make you stronger, right?

03:12.408 --> 03:13.807
Mm.

03:13.977 --> 03:15.945
What happens once
I give you the moonstone?

03:16.379 --> 03:19.871
We'll live happily ever after.
I promise.

03:20.516 --> 03:22.347
I'll bring it tonight, I promise.

03:22.518 --> 03:26.113
I promise you,
we're gonna get through this.

03:28.324 --> 03:30.121
I love you, Stefan.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.284
You know I love you.

03:33.496 --> 03:34.520
I love you too.

03:54.517 --> 03:57.384
- I need to talk to you.
- And when I need to talk to you...

03:57.553 --> 04:01.512
Tyler has to kill someone to activate
his curse. He's not a werewolf yet.

04:01.691 --> 04:03.989
Wow, fascinating. Not enough.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.027
But Mason Lockwood is,
and he's looking for a moonstone...

04:07.196 --> 04:10.688
...a special rock connected to the
werewolf legend. That's why he's here.

04:10.867 --> 04:12.129
A moonstone?

04:12.302 --> 04:15.169
- And I know where it is.
- And you're bringing me this, why?

04:15.338 --> 04:17.805
Do I need a reason?
Look, I just wanna help, okay?

04:17.974 --> 04:21.137
What'd your sister say
about this little discovery?

04:21.844 --> 04:25.644
- Oh, you haven't told her, have you?
- Elena doesn't want me getting involved.

04:25.815 --> 04:28.340
And you're a Gilbert.
You just can't help yourself.

04:30.219 --> 04:31.345
Wow.

04:31.521 --> 04:35.321
Your search for life's purpose
is as obvious as it is tragic.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.549
Are you gonna let me in or not?

04:46.202 --> 04:48.670
Jenna, thanks for helping
wrangle the volunteers.

04:48.838 --> 04:50.738
Of course. It's for a good cause.

04:50.907 --> 04:54.035
Plus, I have always been a sucker
for the masquerade ball.

04:54.978 --> 04:58.209
So was Richard. This was always
his favorite party of the year.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.009
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Boys, be careful with that.

05:01.184 --> 05:03.618
It's from the 1800s. Excuse me.

05:03.786 --> 05:05.845
- Tyler.
- Mom, we got it.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.255
- Stefan. Hey.
- Hey.

05:09.425 --> 05:12.019
I'm cooking dinner tonight.
Ric will be there.

05:12.195 --> 05:15.221
- You should come.
- Oh, um...

05:15.398 --> 05:18.856
You know, Elena and I,
we're kind of taking a...

05:19.802 --> 05:21.394
- A pause.
- Really?

05:23.039 --> 05:25.633
Because that's not what it sounded like
this morning.

05:27.543 --> 05:29.204
Light sleeper.

05:32.749 --> 05:36.310
You know what? I heard nothing.

05:47.897 --> 05:51.128
- You're here.
- I'm here.

05:53.903 --> 05:58.067
- Caroline's not coming. I told you.
- Just making sure.

05:58.841 --> 06:01.071
Eventually, you're gonna have
to talk to her.

06:01.244 --> 06:03.678
Could you make it less obvious
you're on her side?

06:03.846 --> 06:06.474
- There are no sides, Bonnie.
- Come on.

06:06.649 --> 06:09.584
Since Caroline became a vampire,
we barely see each other.

06:09.752 --> 06:13.654
Losing Caroline was bad enough.
I didn't think I'd lose you too.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.789
Come with me.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.194
Where?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.861
Not here. Someplace quiet.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.101
We have to talk.

06:51.194 --> 06:52.388
You didn't eat much.

06:55.731 --> 06:57.494
Good news.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.830
Dr. Damon said the vervain's almost
out of your system.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.733
So with any luck,
you'll be freshly compelled...

07:03.906 --> 07:05.737
...and back in your own bed
by tonight.

07:09.979 --> 07:13.745
Are you really just gonna pretend
like I don't exist?

07:14.817 --> 07:17.479
Yes. So please go.

07:20.556 --> 07:23.753
As usual, you don't care. Got it.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.222
Just like before I was a vampire.

07:27.897 --> 07:30.365
It's not like I died or anything.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.360
Are you...?

07:34.637 --> 07:36.229
Are you really dead?

07:39.442 --> 07:41.342
Yes and no.

07:42.245 --> 07:44.236
How is it possible?

07:53.956 --> 07:55.048
Ric.

08:00.363 --> 08:01.523
What are you doing here?

08:01.697 --> 08:04.689
Helping Damon. I'm the one
who found out about the moonstone.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.029
Does Elena know you're here?

08:08.204 --> 08:10.365
- Not exactly.
- What do you got?

08:10.540 --> 08:13.737
This is Isobel's research from Duke.
Her assistant sent it to me.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.606
- Mm. Vanessa, the hottie.
- Yeah. Vanessa. Yes.

08:16.779 --> 08:19.145
Do you remember the Aztec curse
she told us about?

08:19.315 --> 08:21.943
- Sun and the moon, blah, blah, blah?
- The Aztec curse. Cool.

08:22.118 --> 08:24.586
Vampires and werewolves
used to roam freely...

08:24.754 --> 08:27.587
...until a shaman put a curse on them
to limit their power.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.317
Since then, uh, werewolves can only turn
on a full moon...

08:30.493 --> 08:33.758
...and vampires are weakened
by the sun.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.130
- Most of them, anyway.
- According to the legend...

08:37.299 --> 08:41.760
...the werewolf part of the curse,
it's sealed with the moonstone.

08:42.238 --> 08:44.502
- What do you mean, sealed?
- It's a witch thing.

08:44.707 --> 08:47.835
Whatever seals the curse
is the key to unsealing the curse.

08:48.010 --> 08:51.138
Maybe Mason believes he can
use the moonstone to break the curse.

08:51.314 --> 08:54.306
If we start believing in
some supernatural witchy-woo legend...

08:54.483 --> 08:56.644
...from a picture book, we're idiots.

08:56.819 --> 08:58.684
- Who has the stone now?
- Tyler.

08:58.854 --> 09:00.913
- Can you get it?
- Yeah.

09:01.090 --> 09:04.025
- See? Now your life has purpose.
- So you do believe it?

09:04.227 --> 09:07.162
It's the same book that says
a werewolf bite kills a vampire.

09:07.330 --> 09:11.994
Ignoring it would make me
an even bigger idiot. Let's go.

09:12.501 --> 09:13.593
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

09:14.503 --> 09:17.165
It's a lot. I know.

09:17.340 --> 09:21.800
Katherine's been doing everything that
she can to drive me and Stefan apart...

09:21.978 --> 09:24.640
...and Caroline just got trapped
in the middle.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.181
It's not that you and Stefan
are pretending to fight.

09:28.351 --> 09:31.787
It's that I didn't even know
you guys were fighting at all.

09:33.356 --> 09:35.847
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna keep things from you.

09:36.025 --> 09:38.892
You've made it clear where you stand
with the vampire thing.

09:39.061 --> 09:42.758
- So that makes me the odd man out?
- No. No, Bonnie, of course not.

09:43.799 --> 09:48.964
I know where I stand, Elena,
and I know where you stand.

09:50.072 --> 09:51.835
But where do we stand?

09:53.542 --> 09:55.669
You're my best friend, Bonnie.

09:55.845 --> 10:01.579
I didn't mean to let this craziness
with Caroline get in the way of that.

10:02.051 --> 10:04.315
But she needs you too.

10:04.487 --> 10:08.924
Not yet. I just...
She's a vampire. I can't.

10:12.595 --> 10:14.790
I think we should get back.

10:25.941 --> 10:29.900
- Hey, Stefan.
- Hey, Mason.

10:30.079 --> 10:32.547
Wasn't expecting you here.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.946
- Or anywhere.
- Yeah, I had this little accident.

10:36.352 --> 10:38.377
But, uh, I'm fine now.

10:41.357 --> 10:43.882
- What did you do to Sheriff Forbes?
- Oh, she's fine too.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.052
But from now on,
you'll have to do your own dirty work.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.460
Not a problem.

10:54.270 --> 10:55.294
Oh.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.463
Excuse me.

11:05.548 --> 11:09.348
- What's the matter? You okay?
- When I touched him, I saw something.

11:09.785 --> 11:11.377
What do you mean, like a vision?

11:12.088 --> 11:15.649
- I saw Elena.
- You saw Elena?

11:15.858 --> 11:17.758
He was kissing her.

11:18.394 --> 11:21.727
No, Bonnie, Elena wouldn't kiss...

11:26.869 --> 11:31.897
You didn't see Elena.
You saw Katherine.

11:45.654 --> 11:48.919
- Damon, what are you doing here?
- Looking for my baby bro.

11:49.091 --> 11:52.959
Speaking of, could you tell yours
to stop following me around?

11:53.129 --> 11:56.223
- What's going on?
- Ask eager beaver.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.666
- What is he making you do?
- He's not making me do anything.

12:00.836 --> 12:03.066
- Damon and l...
- Uh, no. No way. No, no, no.

12:03.239 --> 12:04.763
There is no "Damon and you."

12:04.940 --> 12:07.101
There's Damon
and whoever Damon's using...

12:07.276 --> 12:09.904
...and those people end up dead.
Whatever's going on...

12:10.079 --> 12:13.071
...I want you to stay out of it.
- I don't care what you want.

12:13.249 --> 12:15.740
It's because of you
that I'm in this mess.

12:15.918 --> 12:19.513
So, I'm sorry, you don't really get
to tell me what I'm gonna do.

12:22.091 --> 12:23.752
Katherine's with Mason Lockwood?

12:23.926 --> 12:26.827
He got into town right after she did.
It makes perfect sense.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.930
I know, but Mason Lockwood?

12:29.098 --> 12:31.259
Werewolf thing aside,
the guy's a surfer.

12:31.434 --> 12:34.426
- She's gotta be using him. She has to be.
- Using him for what?

12:34.603 --> 12:36.264
Mason's looking for a moonstone...

12:36.439 --> 12:39.203
...that allegedly can break
the full-moon werewolf curse.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.707
- Maybe Katherine wants it as well.
- Why?

12:41.877 --> 12:45.870
Well... No idea.
That's the beauty of Katherine.

12:46.048 --> 12:48.516
She's always up to something.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.447
How are we gonna find
this moonstone?

12:50.619 --> 12:55.022
- Jeremy's getting it from Tyler.
- Why would you involve Jeremy?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.990
He's playing Indiana Jones.
He involved himself.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.694
She's this amazing girl one minute...

13:02.865 --> 13:05.129
...and then this raging jealous freak
the next.

13:05.301 --> 13:07.235
You know what I think
of Caroline Forbes.

13:07.403 --> 13:10.031
She's an insecure, neurotic,
bitchy little twit.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.175
- Hey.
- But the girl's got heart. She means well.

13:13.342 --> 13:15.640
Just gotta take the good
with the bad sometimes.

13:15.811 --> 13:17.506
Yeah.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.976
I'm gonna go get an extension cord.
I'll be right back.

13:25.087 --> 13:27.920
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

13:28.090 --> 13:31.184
Hey, so I, uh... I did a little research
on that stone you showed me.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.988
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

13:34.163 --> 13:36.996
- Curiosity. Uh, boredom.
- What'd it say?

13:37.166 --> 13:40.897
It's part of this Aztec legend. I wanna
make sure it's the same kind of stone.

13:41.070 --> 13:45.006
- You think I could, uh, check it out again?
- Nope. Gave it to my uncle.

13:45.508 --> 13:47.237
Why'd you do that?

13:47.409 --> 13:49.707
Because I'm done with legends
and curses.

13:49.879 --> 13:52.575
I don't want anything
to do with it, okay?

13:52.748 --> 13:57.913
Yeah. Uh, yeah, sure. It's probably
just stupid folklore anyways. Forget it.

14:19.575 --> 14:22.544
- Okay. Okay. This is as far as I go.
- Okay.

14:22.711 --> 14:24.542
- What do you want?
- A favor.

14:24.713 --> 14:26.874
- Like that's gonna happen.
- So predictable.

14:27.049 --> 14:28.277
That's why I brought him.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.883
I know how you feel
about helping us out.

14:37.059 --> 14:39.721
Since you're the one
that linked Mason with Katherine...

14:39.895 --> 14:43.797
...we have an opportunity to get an
upper hand on them. So just hear us out.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.990
Pretty please.

14:56.679 --> 14:57.703
I'm listening.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.246
I have to fill Elena in
on what's going on.

15:00.416 --> 15:04.785
- Can you play nice, please?
- Yes.

15:04.954 --> 15:08.253
- Hey. You shouldn't be calling me.
- I have no idea what's happening.

15:08.424 --> 15:11.416
Damon's got Jeremy into something.
You've got Bonnie with you.

15:11.594 --> 15:14.188
I'm sorting stupid masquerade masks
for Mrs. Lockwood.

15:14.396 --> 15:16.193
All right. It's okay. Hold on.

15:16.398 --> 15:19.424
Touch Mason again,
see if he gave Katherine the moonstone.

15:19.602 --> 15:21.126
My visions don't work like that.

15:21.303 --> 15:24.830
- I don't get to ask questions.
- How inconvenient.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.204
Although, let's talk about
that witchy juju thing you do with me...

15:28.410 --> 15:30.935
...the fun one
where my brain bursts into flames.

15:31.113 --> 15:34.105
- What is that?
- That's me giving you an aneurism.

15:34.283 --> 15:37.150
Your blood vessels go pop,
but you heal quickly...

15:37.319 --> 15:39.947
...so I do it over and over again.

15:40.456 --> 15:42.788
- Is it vampire-specific?
- It'd work on anyone...

15:42.958 --> 15:46.121
...with a supernatural healing ability.
- Good. Good, good.

15:46.295 --> 15:48.195
Damon, I'm not gonna
help you hurt him.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.697
Mason Lockwood's a werewolf.
Katherine's evil. They're the bad guys.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.734
Really? You're gonna play
morality police with me right now?

15:54.937 --> 15:57.804
They're a threat to Elena.

15:57.973 --> 16:01.409
So you, witch,
are gonna get over yourself and help us.

16:01.577 --> 16:04.842
Yeah, he meant that as a question
with a "please" on the end.

16:05.014 --> 16:06.572
Absolutely.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.377
Hey, can you move your van?
Blocked in.

16:15.457 --> 16:17.721
Hey, how'd you get stuck
doing that by yourself?

16:17.893 --> 16:21.522
All the guys bailed. Something about
draft picks? I don't know.

16:21.697 --> 16:24.461
- I don't speak that language.
- Let me give you a hand.

16:34.877 --> 16:36.742
Sorry.

16:59.334 --> 17:01.302
So I mainly drink from blood bags.

17:01.470 --> 17:03.870
It's not as good as the fresh stuff...

17:04.039 --> 17:07.805
...but it beats the animal blood that
Stefan's been trying to get me to drink.

17:07.976 --> 17:11.069
- You steal the blood from the hospital?
- Damon does.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.578
I've been pilfering his supply, so...

17:13.781 --> 17:16.979
As long as you have blood,
you don't need to kill?

17:19.354 --> 17:24.189
I want to. It's my basic nature now.

17:24.358 --> 17:29.888
But on a healthy diet, I can control it.
I'm getting better at it.

17:30.866 --> 17:35.496
I'm better than Stefan.
He's a bit of a problem drinker.

17:35.671 --> 17:37.730
A bloodoholic. Ha, ha.

17:38.874 --> 17:40.535
I don't want this for you.

17:41.944 --> 17:43.707
I know.

17:45.114 --> 17:47.844
But when life gives you lemons...

17:51.587 --> 17:52.713
Damon's home.

17:58.861 --> 18:00.954
Here's his bag.

18:01.764 --> 18:03.425
As requested.

18:04.032 --> 18:06.193
Here. Grab that corner.

18:06.368 --> 18:09.098
- Why are we doing this?
- I don't wanna stain the carpet.

18:09.271 --> 18:10.829
I knew you were gonna say that.

18:12.241 --> 18:14.266
You're judging again.

18:16.578 --> 18:18.546
He's not gonna be out much longer.

18:18.714 --> 18:20.773
Whoa.

18:20.949 --> 18:23.782
Looks like this guy's used
to being tied up. Heh.

18:27.055 --> 18:28.079
What are you doing?

18:28.257 --> 18:31.317
You're looking for a moonstone.
I am trying to help you find it.

18:31.493 --> 18:36.123
Good. Yeah. Find out if he gave it
to Katherine. Find out where she is.

18:36.298 --> 18:39.665
And find out what they're gonna do
with it once they get it.

18:40.803 --> 18:44.739
It's somewhere small. Dark.

18:45.407 --> 18:47.967
- There's water.
- Like a sewer?

18:48.143 --> 18:51.408
No. Like a well?

18:51.580 --> 18:54.981
That can't be right. Yeah.

18:55.784 --> 18:58.685
- It's a well.
- Why would it be in a well?

19:00.022 --> 19:01.785
I told you, I only get what I get.

19:03.725 --> 19:07.422
- No.
- That's it. That's all I got.

19:08.030 --> 19:09.998
Hey, Judgey.

19:10.766 --> 19:12.131
Thank you.

19:16.305 --> 19:18.899
Come on. Wake up, wolf boy.

19:23.846 --> 19:25.541
Hey.

19:26.615 --> 19:28.310
Hi.

19:30.219 --> 19:33.450
How's your mom?
Elena filled me in on everything.

19:33.622 --> 19:37.183
Um, I'm gonna take her home tonight.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.155
Caroline, uh...

19:42.631 --> 19:43.859
Never mind. I gotta go.

19:44.032 --> 19:49.368
- Did you, uh, find the moonstone thing?
- Not yet.

19:51.673 --> 19:55.006
Do you remember that old well where
we used to play when we were kids?

19:55.177 --> 19:56.201
Yeah.

19:56.378 --> 19:58.369
It's in the woods.
Do you remember where?

19:58.547 --> 20:02.483
On the edge of
the old Lockwood property. Why?

20:03.151 --> 20:05.711
Think that's where Mason
is keeping the moonstone.

20:07.322 --> 20:09.847
- I gotta go.
- Well, I can come with you.

20:10.025 --> 20:12.084
No. It's okay.

20:16.331 --> 20:17.855
Sure.

20:19.034 --> 20:20.058
Okay.

20:24.072 --> 20:25.096
<i>So where's Caroline?</i>

20:25.274 --> 20:28.004
This is, like, her thing.
I can't believe she's not here.

20:28.176 --> 20:29.666
She has something else to do.

20:31.914 --> 20:33.006
Is she seeing someone?

20:34.249 --> 20:36.342
Matt, come on.

20:36.518 --> 20:37.985
No, she's not.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.425
Anyone seen Mason?

20:44.593 --> 20:47.528
He, uh... He took off.
Said he wasn't sure when he'd be back.

20:48.063 --> 20:49.394
So weird.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.107
I'm not even gonna ask.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.820
I'll be right back.

21:20.662 --> 21:22.061
Ooh.

21:24.566 --> 21:25.624
Someone's feisty.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.101
What?

21:47.456 --> 21:50.425
You can hurt. Good to know.

21:50.592 --> 21:54.756
I was afraid you were gonna be some
Beastmaster with no affinity for pain.

21:56.631 --> 22:00.567
Oh, but you heal quickly. Not good.

22:01.370 --> 22:04.168
Guess I'll just have
to keep applying pain.

22:11.947 --> 22:15.007
So Katherine.

22:16.184 --> 22:19.017
How do you know her?
What's she up to?

22:24.326 --> 22:26.590
I have all day.

22:59.061 --> 23:01.222
- What's going on?
- You shouldn't be here.

23:01.396 --> 23:04.888
I know, but I am. What's going on?

23:05.067 --> 23:07.934
Bonnie thinks the moonstone
is down here.

23:26.755 --> 23:29.383
Hey, be careful.

23:29.791 --> 23:31.486
Only be down there for a minute.

23:47.609 --> 23:49.133
- Elena!
- Stefan?

23:49.311 --> 23:51.302
Elena!

23:51.813 --> 23:53.212
Stefan, what's happening?

23:56.051 --> 23:59.714
- What's going on in there?
- Vervain.

24:05.894 --> 24:07.225
Stefan!

24:14.069 --> 24:15.559
- Stefan!
- Elena.

24:15.737 --> 24:18.570
Caroline, Stefan's down there.
And the chain is rusted. L...

24:18.740 --> 24:21.538
No, no, no. You can't.
It's filled with vervain.

24:23.778 --> 24:25.871
- Caroline, we've gotta get him out.
- Well...

24:26.047 --> 24:27.708
Now!

24:31.887 --> 24:34.219
When did you two meet?

24:34.389 --> 24:37.552
She seduce you and tell you
she loved you? You're supernatural...

24:37.726 --> 24:41.355
...so she can't compel you.
I'm sure she used her other charms.

24:41.997 --> 24:43.294
Katherine's good that way.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.258
Thought I told you to leave.

24:47.435 --> 24:49.562
I found something
in, uh, Ric's box of stuff.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.762
Ooh.

24:52.941 --> 24:53.965
What is it?

24:54.142 --> 24:59.045
Um, I did a search on my phone.
It's a plant. <i>Aconitum vulparia.</i>

24:59.214 --> 25:01.978
Grows in the, uh, mountainous areas
of the northern hemisphere.

25:02.150 --> 25:05.984
Commonly known as aconite,
blue rocket, and wolfsbane.

25:06.154 --> 25:07.280
What else did you read?

25:07.455 --> 25:09.446
Every source
says something different.

25:09.624 --> 25:12.491
One myth says it causes lycanthropy,
which sounds bogus.

25:12.661 --> 25:16.757
Another one says that it protects people.
And another one says, well, it's toxic.

25:19.768 --> 25:20.962
I'm guessing toxic.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.803
What's Katherine doing
in Mystic Falls?

25:42.457 --> 25:45.290
- Why is she here?
- She's here with me.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.758
Why do you ask? You jealous?

25:48.129 --> 25:49.187
How rude of me.

25:49.364 --> 25:53.630
You know, heh, heh, I just realized
I didn't offer you anything to eat.

25:55.237 --> 25:56.898
Yummy.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.283
I got you. Okay?

26:13.321 --> 26:15.846
- Okay.
- What's going on? You took off in a blur.

26:16.024 --> 26:18.993
I heard Elena screaming.
Help her. Now.

26:21.396 --> 26:22.693
- You ready?
- Yeah.

26:36.344 --> 26:39.142
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Keep going.

26:39.314 --> 26:41.339
Come on.

26:49.991 --> 26:51.015
Hey.

26:52.661 --> 26:53.855
Oh, my God.

26:58.400 --> 27:01.494
- Elena, what's going on down there?
- Pull him up!

27:25.593 --> 27:29.962
- Elena? I'm ready for you.
- Hold on.

27:30.165 --> 27:31.530
I need to find the stone.

27:39.541 --> 27:40.565
Hurry.

27:46.614 --> 27:49.583
Hold on. I think I found it.

28:04.566 --> 28:06.193
Elena, what's going on?

28:09.104 --> 28:12.767
I got it. Come on. Bring me up.

28:23.985 --> 28:25.714
Oh, God.

28:29.524 --> 28:31.958
- Stefan.
- Stefan.

28:38.833 --> 28:41.165
I got the stone, Stefan.

28:41.770 --> 28:45.137
Stefan, it's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

28:45.740 --> 28:47.708
- What do you want with the moonstone?
- Screw you.

28:49.077 --> 28:50.101
Wrong answer.

28:50.278 --> 28:52.303
If he was gonna say anything,
he would've already.

28:52.480 --> 28:56.280
- Taking your eyes now.
- The well.

28:56.451 --> 28:58.510
- You can find it there.
- I know where it is.

28:58.686 --> 29:00.847
I wanna know what it does
and why you want it.

29:01.022 --> 29:02.990
- I'm getting it for Katherine.
- Why?

29:03.158 --> 29:06.753
- She's gonna use it to lift the curse.
- Of the moon?

29:07.495 --> 29:09.986
Why would a vampire help a werewolf
break a curse...

29:10.165 --> 29:12.395
...that keeps them from turning
when they want?

29:12.567 --> 29:14.660
- So I wouldn't have to turn anymore.
- Why?

29:14.836 --> 29:16.565
Because she loves me.

29:23.278 --> 29:26.839
No. Now I get it. You're just stupid.

29:28.383 --> 29:31.079
Katherine doesn't love you.
She's using you, you moron.

29:31.586 --> 29:32.883
I'm done talking.

29:34.088 --> 29:35.988
Yes, you are.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.218
Time to take a walk, Jeremy.

29:40.895 --> 29:43.864
- I'm staying.
- No. You should go.

29:44.032 --> 29:47.832
- I'm staying, Damon. He's had enough.
- Just help Tyler.

29:48.002 --> 29:51.062
- Don't let this happen to him.
- Damon...

29:52.907 --> 29:55.899
You wanted to be a part of this?
- Kill or be killed.

29:56.077 --> 29:59.342
The guy's a werewolf.
He'd kill me the first chance he got.

29:59.514 --> 30:02.745
So you suck it up or leave.

30:06.821 --> 30:09.381
He wants me to kill him, anyway.

30:11.092 --> 30:12.616
Don't you, Mason?

30:14.596 --> 30:16.257
It really is a curse, isn't it?

30:21.736 --> 30:24.432
You know, I look at you,
and I see myself.

30:24.606 --> 30:27.404
A less dashing,
less intelligent version.

30:28.643 --> 30:31.476
- I love her.
- Oh, I know.

30:31.646 --> 30:33.876
I've been where you are.

30:35.350 --> 30:37.750
But Katherine will only
rip your heart out.

30:40.288 --> 30:42.415
Let me do it for her.

30:58.273 --> 31:02.004
- You're pretty handy with that thing.
- Yeah, well, it's a skill. Ha, ha.

31:02.176 --> 31:03.473
Here.

31:08.416 --> 31:12.011
Mm. Where's the, um... The sea salt?

31:13.087 --> 31:14.577
Table.

31:25.633 --> 31:26.998
<i>Are you okay?</i>

31:33.341 --> 31:35.400
So I pulled Stefan out of this well...

31:35.610 --> 31:39.239
...and he's all vervained
and just rotted...

31:39.414 --> 31:42.872
...but Bonnie wasn't mean to me once,
and I just...

31:43.051 --> 31:47.715
I really think it's progress, you know?
I just... What?

31:49.324 --> 31:50.723
I'm freaking you out?

31:50.892 --> 31:53.383
It's just that you've become
this person...

31:53.561 --> 31:56.155
Don't. L... Don't. L...

31:56.331 --> 31:59.027
We were just starting to get along.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.636
This strong, this confident person.

32:02.804 --> 32:03.828
Oh.

32:07.742 --> 32:09.539
Thank you.

32:11.913 --> 32:14.381
You don't have to take
my memories away.

32:15.717 --> 32:17.241
I'll keep your secret.

32:17.418 --> 32:21.650
Look, if you're worried about them,
just say you compelled me.

32:23.091 --> 32:24.251
I won't tell.

32:26.694 --> 32:29.356
I'll never do anything to hurt you.

32:31.532 --> 32:34.092
You know, we never talk like this.

32:34.569 --> 32:36.366
Ever.

32:37.438 --> 32:41.169
- And today meant so much to me.
- Me too.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.536
I know...

32:46.714 --> 32:48.238
I know I can trust you.

32:51.586 --> 32:54.054
But you're never going to trust them.

32:58.259 --> 33:00.420
I'm going to take you home.

33:01.562 --> 33:04.725
You're going to forget
that I'm a vampire.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.299
I'm gonna forget
that you're a vampire.

33:08.469 --> 33:11.438
You'll remember you got sick
with the flu.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.174
You had a fever. It...

33:14.342 --> 33:17.436
Chills and ickiness.

33:18.212 --> 33:20.578
And I made you soup...

33:21.282 --> 33:23.807
...and it was really salty.

33:24.952 --> 33:28.718
We bickered. You got better.

33:30.224 --> 33:33.284
And then your selfish little daughter...

33:33.961 --> 33:37.988
...who loves you, no matter what...

33:40.735 --> 33:43.465
...went right back to ignoring you.

33:46.674 --> 33:49.302
And all is right in the world.

33:55.683 --> 33:58.049
- All this for that?
- Yup.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.187
I see you've exercised
your usual restraint.

34:02.356 --> 34:03.482
Had to be done.

34:07.562 --> 34:14.024
"Carol. Big opportunity in Florida.
Gonna be gone. For a long time.

34:15.469 --> 34:18.371
Will send for my things
once I get settled.

34:18.539 --> 34:21.132
Much love, Mason."

34:21.309 --> 34:22.867
Let's get rid of the body.

34:23.043 --> 34:26.036
Ooh. Last number dialed.

34:26.214 --> 34:29.775
- I wonder who that could possibly be.
- No, no, no. Don't provoke her.

34:34.822 --> 34:37.416
Mason, you should've been here
an hour ago.

34:37.592 --> 34:38.820
Wrong boy toy.

34:41.596 --> 34:43.324
Damon.

34:43.498 --> 34:46.763
For once, you've surprised me.
I assume Mason's with you?

34:46.934 --> 34:50.426
He's right beside me.
Although his heart's across the room.

34:53.808 --> 34:55.672
You shouldn't have.

34:56.210 --> 34:58.678
I've had a very busy day today.

34:58.846 --> 35:00.677
Killed a werewolf.
Found the moonstone.

35:00.848 --> 35:04.841
Did you know that he hid the moonstone
in a bottom of a well full of vervain?

35:05.019 --> 35:06.919
<i>Guess he didn't trust you very much.</i>

35:07.088 --> 35:10.285
<i>Although he did love you. Poor guy.</i>

35:10.458 --> 35:14.588
Hey, where are you? Because I can bring
him over. Last goodbyes and all that.

35:14.762 --> 35:17.253
You have no idea
what you've just done.

35:17.431 --> 35:19.899
Did I put a kink in your master plan?
I'm so sorry.

35:20.067 --> 35:22.763
Do you honestly believe
that I don't have a Plan B?

35:22.937 --> 35:25.872
And if that fails,
a Plan C, then a Plan D, and...

35:26.040 --> 35:28.235
<i>You know how</i>
<i>the alphabet works, don't you?</i>

35:29.343 --> 35:31.641
Send my love to Stefan.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.282
Where's Jeremy?

35:44.458 --> 35:46.892
He went up to his room.
He said he wasn't hungry.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.928
- Who is she talking to?
- I don't know.

35:50.097 --> 35:54.056
- Everything go okay today?
- There were a few hiccups, but yeah.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.169
Of course. I understand.

35:56.370 --> 35:59.362
- Elena, it's for you.
- Who is it?

36:00.875 --> 36:03.969
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Elena.</i>

36:09.483 --> 36:11.974
- Katherine.
- Did you enjoy your little rendezvous...

36:12.153 --> 36:16.180
...with Stefan this morning?
I will always know, Elena.

36:16.390 --> 36:20.121
I will always be one step ahead of you.
When are you gonna figure that out?

36:21.429 --> 36:24.455
<i>Do you know how easy</i>
<i>it was to get inside of your house?</i>

36:24.632 --> 36:27.328
To replace Aunt Jenna's
vervain perfume?

36:27.501 --> 36:30.470
<i>To convince her</i>
<i>to stop drinking her special tea?</i>

36:33.040 --> 36:36.441
- No.
- Jenna's been my spy for days now.

36:36.611 --> 36:40.775
But unlike you,
Jenna actually listens to me.

36:40.948 --> 36:44.975
<i>So when I suggest the world would be</i>
<i>a much better place if she were to just...</i>

36:45.152 --> 36:46.176
Jenna, no!

36:48.155 --> 36:49.952
Jenna! Oh.

36:50.124 --> 36:55.027
- Jenna.
- Well, you get the idea.

37:03.838 --> 37:07.831
<i>Trauma team to the ER.</i>
<i>Trauma team to the ER.</i>

37:08.476 --> 37:09.500
Is she okay?

37:09.677 --> 37:13.169
The doctors told Alaric
that she got lucky.

37:13.347 --> 37:16.009
She's gonna make it.
She's gonna be okay.

37:16.183 --> 37:18.777
- Does she remember what happened?
- No. Nothing.

37:18.986 --> 37:21.216
It's all part of Katherine's
mind compulsion.

37:21.389 --> 37:23.357
Now, why would Katherine
hurt Jenna?

37:23.524 --> 37:26.288
Because she's trying
to send a message.

37:26.494 --> 37:30.521
- That she could get to anybody.
- Hey. Hey. Hey. Come here.

37:30.698 --> 37:34.293
- Look, it's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not.

37:35.903 --> 37:38.098
She's gonna pay, Elena.

37:38.272 --> 37:41.036
I don't know how,
but she's gonna pay.

37:57.224 --> 37:59.089
- Looks good.
- Thanks.

37:59.260 --> 38:02.821
It was nice to see Matt today.
He hasn't been around for a while.

38:03.030 --> 38:05.328
We've both been busy, I guess.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.593
Have you seen Mason?
The guy's been AWOL all day.

38:11.105 --> 38:13.300
Actually, Tyler...

38:14.241 --> 38:16.402
...Mason headed back to Florida.

38:17.345 --> 38:19.404
- What?
- I'm sorry, honey.

38:19.580 --> 38:22.014
I know how much you two hit it off.

38:22.183 --> 38:24.583
- So he just left?
- I was hoping he'd stick around.

38:24.752 --> 38:27.949
I thought that,
with your dad gone, that...

38:29.256 --> 38:31.315
Anyway, he's gone.

38:31.993 --> 38:36.555
So I guess it's just you and me now.

38:58.719 --> 39:00.152
I'm so sorry.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.216
We were stupid.

39:03.391 --> 39:06.224
Sneaking around, thinking
that we weren't gonna get caught.

39:08.396 --> 39:10.887
- I know.
- We did this.

39:11.098 --> 39:15.694
Stefan, Jenna's in the hospital,
and Jeremy could be next.

39:15.870 --> 39:19.567
All because we didn't listen to her.
Because...

39:19.740 --> 39:21.139
Because we're together.

39:27.014 --> 39:29.676
- Stefan...
- I know what you're gonna say to me.

39:29.850 --> 39:31.112
Then let me say it.

39:34.021 --> 39:37.718
I've been so selfish
because I love you so much...

39:37.892 --> 39:40.725
...and I know how much you love me.

39:43.998 --> 39:45.329
But it's over.

39:46.367 --> 39:48.426
- Stefan, it has to be.
- Elena, I don't...

39:48.636 --> 39:50.433
No, Stefan.

39:56.243 --> 39:57.904
It has to be.

40:31.779 --> 40:33.178
Elena.

40:39.820 --> 40:42.380
I riled Katherine up. L...

40:43.090 --> 40:47.390
- I wasn't thinking. I didn't think.
- It doesn't matter, Damon.

40:48.629 --> 40:49.687
She won.

40:52.333 --> 40:53.800
Katherine won.

41:06.847 --> 41:09.748
I apologize if I seem rattled.

41:09.917 --> 41:13.978
Circumstances have changed suddenly,
and I had to adjust.

41:14.155 --> 41:16.817
Mind control is a necessary evil.

41:16.991 --> 41:21.860
You see, I need a werewolf,
and I've lost the one that I had.

41:22.029 --> 41:25.021
Now tell me what you're going to do
to help me get a new one.

41:25.933 --> 41:28.094
I'm going to go after Tyler Lockwood.

41:29.803 --> 41:32.636
And you're not going to stop.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.803
And I'm not going to stop.

41:35.609 --> 41:37.008
Until?

41:37.745 --> 41:39.770
Until he kills me.
