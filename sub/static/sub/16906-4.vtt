08:54.439 --> 08:56.273
Because that's our capital.

08:56.308 --> 08:59.026
But I'm judging Spike TV's
<i>Miss Nude divorcee</i>

08:59.060 --> 09:00.644
in Tampa on Christmas Eve.

09:00.695 --> 09:01.729
Oh.

09:01.763 --> 09:03.263
And I was gonna visit MGM studios.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.782
The rides there capture

09:04.816 --> 09:06.817
the thrills and chills of the movies.

09:06.868 --> 09:07.868
And it doesn't end there,

09:07.869 --> 09:09.189
because my people are everywhere.

09:09.190 --> 09:10.790
If you ever want to pick your ball color

09:10.822 --> 09:11.989
at a putt-putt course,

09:12.040 --> 09:14.825
or have your alligator
euthanized humanely,

09:14.876 --> 09:16.610
or fly on delta,

09:16.628 --> 09:17.828
you will back off,

09:17.879 --> 09:21.415
or the crabcatchers will come for you.

09:21.449 --> 09:24.451
Just as soon as it's cool
for them to drive.

09:27.539 --> 09:28.639
It's a gray hoodie.

09:28.673 --> 09:30.113
It say's "who farted?"
On the back.

09:30.114 --> 09:32.459
It's got a bunch of tampons in the pocket.

09:32.493 --> 09:33.893
I don't know what else to tell you.

09:33.894 --> 09:34.795
Lemon, there you are.

09:34.829 --> 09:36.109
Did your girlfriend even cancel?

09:36.110 --> 09:38.165
Or was this more Karl Rove trickery?

09:38.183 --> 09:40.167
Sorry, but I needed you to come, Lemon.

09:40.185 --> 09:41.345
This luncheon is a fundraiser

09:41.346 --> 09:42.519
for my personal super pac

09:42.554 --> 09:44.504
"Americans
for an American America."

09:44.522 --> 09:47.191
I needed to unite the room
around a common enemy.

09:47.225 --> 09:48.665
And Ed Begley Jr.
wasn't available,

09:48.666 --> 09:50.394
because the sail on his car broke.

09:50.445 --> 09:53.447
See, this is why 50.1%
of Americans hate Republicans.

09:53.481 --> 09:55.649
Because you're sneaky and cynical.

09:55.683 --> 09:57.723
Cynical? I think I'm
the very opposite of cynical.

09:57.724 --> 09:59.404
I'm doing everything I can for my beliefs.

09:59.405 --> 10:01.052
And I truly believe that one rich person

10:01.053 --> 10:02.573
can make a difference in this country,

10:02.624 --> 10:06.076
and a roomful of rich people
can... change the world.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.527
Well, I also believe that one
person can make a difference.

10:08.528 --> 10:09.363
With ideas.

10:09.381 --> 10:11.131
[Guffaws] That really is wonderful.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.326
Harold, you have to hear this.
Lemon, say that again.

10:13.327 --> 10:15.336
Ideas are more powerful than money.

10:15.370 --> 10:15.924
[Laughter]

10:15.925 --> 10:18.005
So what are you gonna do
with all this money, Jack?

10:18.039 --> 10:19.506
Buy ad time?

10:19.540 --> 10:21.308
'Cause I'm already on TV every night,

10:21.343 --> 10:23.394
with a little something called <i>TGS.</i>

10:23.428 --> 10:26.430
And we just got nominated for
a stage managers' guild award.

10:26.481 --> 10:29.266
So you may have millions of dollars, sir,

10:29.317 --> 10:31.518
but America <i>will</i> hear my two cents.

10:31.552 --> 10:32.719
[Check rips from booklet]

10:32.737 --> 10:34.388
That's not what people want, Lemon.

10:34.406 --> 10:35.886
Least of all, from their televisions.

10:35.887 --> 10:37.087
They want their honeys boo boo

10:37.088 --> 10:39.080
and their Sunday night feetball,

10:39.081 --> 10:40.361
which is the plural of football.

10:40.395 --> 10:41.595
Americans don't want to think.

10:41.596 --> 10:43.163
That's why they need men like me

10:43.198 --> 10:45.165
to pick their presidents for them.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.417
Wow. Okay.

10:46.451 --> 10:49.370
So, I guess, it's my words
versus your money.

10:49.404 --> 10:51.284
And we'll see who can really
make a difference

10:51.285 --> 10:51.965
in this election.

10:51.966 --> 10:53.507
It's on, Donaghy.

10:53.541 --> 10:56.927
May the best
gender non-specific person win.

10:56.961 --> 11:00.414
Just leave the amount blank, Harold.

11:00.432 --> 11:01.748
[Clattering]

11:01.766 --> 11:02.916
Those are tampons.

11:02.934 --> 11:04.518
Deal with it.

11:04.552 --> 11:08.472
[Crowd singing]

11:08.523 --> 11:11.825
For God's sake, some of us have jobs!

11:11.860 --> 11:14.394
I've got a pile
of 1020-Gs up he

11:14.412 --> 11:16.396
with no travel times on them,

11:16.414 --> 11:18.866
and if I don't...
[Screams]

11:18.900 --> 11:21.285
Listen up, nerds!

11:21.336 --> 11:23.787
Tonight, <i>TGS</i> is about to get real.

11:23.838 --> 11:25.238
We've got 38 minutes of air time...

11:25.239 --> 11:27.424
An hour, if the bowling
tournament ends early...

11:27.459 --> 11:29.877
And we are gonna use it
to get the message out there.

11:29.911 --> 11:31.211
I don't know.

11:31.245 --> 11:33.125
I think we've been
hitting Romney pretty hard.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.049
I guess that's why they call me Mitt.

11:35.083 --> 11:38.435
"Baseball Mitt Romney"
and "Barack a llama"

11:38.470 --> 11:39.636
aren't saying anything.

11:39.687 --> 11:41.105
I want to make a difference.

11:41.139 --> 11:43.379
We got to do something big,
something that'll go viral.

11:43.391 --> 11:47.294
Like that otter
that looked just like Tracy.

11:47.328 --> 11:49.368
Look, we've got the greatest
resource in the world

11:49.369 --> 11:51.933
at our fingertips:
American celebrity.

11:51.934 --> 11:53.134
We get some hot young actor...

11:53.168 --> 11:54.408
Oh, my grandnephew Kellan lutz,

11:54.409 --> 11:55.609
from <i>Twilight,</i> is visiting me.

11:55.610 --> 11:58.572
He's in my office.

11:58.606 --> 12:00.206
I have tolerated your pathological lying

12:00.207 --> 12:01.125
for six years.

12:01.159 --> 12:05.779
If you speak again, I will kill you.

12:05.797 --> 12:06.964
Great-uncle?

12:06.998 --> 12:10.134
Momma's baby is
out of "marsh-mal-lows."

12:10.168 --> 12:11.833
Sweet grandnephew,

12:11.834 --> 12:13.754
I've been warming
more "marsh-mal-lows" for you

12:13.788 --> 12:15.589
in the pocket of my dungarees.

12:15.623 --> 12:17.591
[Whimsical music]

12:17.625 --> 12:19.259
[Laughs]

12:19.293 --> 12:20.344
[Chomps]

12:20.395 --> 12:24.431
Okay, good job, lutz.

12:24.465 --> 12:27.768
Gentlemen, token silent lady,

12:27.802 --> 12:30.854
we have to spend
all of our wonderful money,

12:30.905 --> 12:33.440
and help my hair-mentor,
Mitt Romney,

12:33.474 --> 12:36.743
become the 11th legitimate
President of the United States.

12:36.778 --> 12:39.163
Garrett, what does the campaign need?

12:39.197 --> 12:40.497
Well, as you know,

12:40.532 --> 12:42.249
with pacs like this, we're not allowed

12:42.283 --> 12:45.335
to have direct contact with candidates.

12:45.370 --> 12:47.004
[Guffaws] I'm kidding.

12:47.038 --> 12:48.839
I'm Garrett Romney, Mitt's my dad.

12:48.873 --> 12:50.824
But here's the thing, Jack.

12:50.842 --> 12:53.343
My brother-dad,
which is mormon for "dad,"

12:53.378 --> 12:55.345
has more money
than he knows what to do with.

12:55.380 --> 12:56.997
With all due respect, Garrett,

12:57.015 --> 12:58.348
I don't think that's a thing.

12:58.383 --> 13:00.384
Well, it's just,
at this point in the campaign,

13:00.435 --> 13:03.670
for us, it's more about ideas than cash.

13:03.688 --> 13:04.688
Garrett, I would slap you

13:04.689 --> 13:06.889
if I didn't know you were going
to get your own planet

13:06.890 --> 13:08.025
when you die.

13:08.059 --> 13:11.002
And until your father has
100% of the vote,

13:11.003 --> 13:12.563
I think we can still make a difference.

13:12.614 --> 13:15.303
I mean, look how poorly we're
polling with African-Americans.

13:15.304 --> 13:17.184
Jack, there's no amount
of money that could...

13:17.202 --> 13:19.162
How dare you talk that way
in front of the pile.

13:19.196 --> 13:20.436
[Goofy voice] Aw, thanks, Jack.

13:20.437 --> 13:21.738
There is no problem in the world

13:21.789 --> 13:23.740
that can't be solved
by throwing money at it.

13:23.791 --> 13:27.711
Now, let's change some black minds.

13:27.745 --> 13:30.714
[Crowd singing]

13:30.748 --> 13:32.716
Look what Jenna's goons have done.

13:32.750 --> 13:33.884

13:33.918 --> 13:35.368
The pranksmen are neutered.

13:35.386 --> 13:37.337
We can't let her get away with this.

13:37.371 --> 13:38.672
Well, what can we do?

13:38.706 --> 13:40.090
We're just three nerdy white guys,

13:40.141 --> 13:42.375
and she's got a whole army.

13:42.393 --> 13:45.679
But what if she didn't?

13:45.713 --> 13:47.380
I know what we should do.

13:47.398 --> 13:49.399
Pumpkin patch?

13:51.385 --> 13:53.804
Hi, I'm Hollywood liberal Don Cheadle,

13:53.838 --> 13:57.574
and I supp...

13:57.609 --> 13:59.392
I support Mitt Romney.

13:59.410 --> 14:00.744
Good, continue.

14:00.778 --> 14:02.529
Barack Obama would have you believe

14:02.564 --> 14:05.249
that African-Americans are
better off under his leadership.

14:05.283 --> 14:07.234
But I just got $10 million

14:07.252 --> 14:08.869
for appearing in an ad for Mitt Romney.

14:08.903 --> 14:10.570
So ask yourselves, brothers and sisters,

14:10.588 --> 14:12.372
who's really got your back?

14:12.407 --> 14:13.707
'Cause from where I'm standing,

14:13.741 --> 14:15.209
Mitt Romney is a...

14:15.243 --> 14:17.761
Oh, my dear...

14:17.795 --> 14:20.047
Mitt Romney is a layup.

14:20.081 --> 14:21.765
But don't just take it from me.

14:21.799 --> 14:25.102
Take it from my good friend
the black transformer, jazz.

with the rom-nizzle.

talk like that in the movie?

That is garbage.

That was don cheadle and jazz,
your heroes.

14:41.486 --> 14:44.738
Do you know how expensive that was?

14:44.772 --> 14:47.291
Okay, I get it.

Let me do some, uh, community organizing.

she <i>will</i> be hearing about this,

Listen to the words!

that ignores the constitution.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.316
In the past 24 hours,

15:50.333 --> 15:52.334
I've spent millions of dollars.

15:52.369 --> 15:55.004
I got B.E.T.
to let Mike Huckabee present

"Best Club Banger"
at the <i>Hip-Hop Awards.</i>

15:57.424 --> 16:00.626
And yet we're still polling
at 0% among African-Americans.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.178
If my money can't make a difference,

16:02.212 --> 16:03.345
I'm moving to Monaco.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.514
- Jack, don't say that.
- I'm serious.

16:05.549 --> 16:07.709
Over there, they solve
all their problems with money.

16:12.689 --> 16:14.523
Why should I even bother to vote?

16:14.558 --> 16:17.676
New York will go for Obama
even if I voted a hundred times.

16:17.694 --> 16:18.811
Instead of my usual five.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.085
Maybe you can make a difference

16:20.086 --> 16:21.197
in a battleground state.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.071
Oh, what's the point, Garrett?
You know what?

election is going to play out.

to see how my friend's doing,

but obviously he went back into
his mouse hole, so, uh...

How are you?

That is not the Lisa Loeb I know.

16:46.890 --> 16:48.373
Why do I even vote?

16:48.391 --> 16:49.871
New York's gonna go for Obama anyway.

16:49.872 --> 16:52.011
Maybe if I lived in Ohio,
I could make a difference.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.095
Actually, no.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.847
Ohio's definitely going for Romney.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.982
Yeah, you don't know
which way Ohio's going.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.017
But I do.

I can tell you exactly how
this election is gonna play out.

17:09.412 --> 17:11.446
Everyone knows Romney has

17:11.498 --> 17:13.582
a vacation home in New Hampshire.

17:13.617 --> 17:14.867
What they don't know

17:14.901 --> 17:17.419
is that he hunts humans on that property.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.255
New Hampshire goes to Obama.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.574
Now, North Carolina goes to Romney.

17:22.592 --> 17:23.901
I worked there this summer,

17:23.902 --> 17:26.262
and they are not on board with
a black man lecturing them.

17:26.296 --> 17:29.265
I don't care if it's Obama
talking about health care

17:29.299 --> 17:31.267
or me talking about white butts.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.919
They are different than black butts.

17:33.937 --> 17:36.639
Pennsylvania is Obama's.

17:36.690 --> 17:39.325
The voting machines there
have become sentient.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.609
And, for some reason,

17:40.644 --> 17:43.095
they are strongly in favor
of gay marriage.

17:43.113 --> 17:44.897
But we're not gonna win Wisconsin.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.482
I don't know why.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.301
Ever since Tracy set fire
to Lambeau Field,

17:49.336 --> 17:52.270
Wisconsinites are coming around
on the death penalty.

17:52.289 --> 17:55.291
Wisconsin goes for Romney.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.126
That just leaves...

17:57.160 --> 18:00.579
Florida, the penis of America!

18:00.613 --> 18:02.081
Florida...

18:02.115 --> 18:05.067
The penis of America.

18:05.101 --> 18:06.618
Pete!

18:06.636 --> 18:08.337
We have a scheme to destroy Jenna

18:08.388 --> 18:09.805
and her army of cretins.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.190
For the past seven years,

18:11.224 --> 18:12.725
I've been compiling a supercut

18:12.759 --> 18:14.910
of all of Jenna Maroney's worst moments.

18:14.944 --> 18:18.147
Security footage,
cell phone videos, rehearsals...

18:18.181 --> 18:21.633
All her biggest diva freak-outs
are on this DVD.

18:21.651 --> 18:23.485
When we put this online,

18:23.520 --> 18:27.656
the crabcatchers will see
what a fraud Jenna is.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.325
[Grunting]

18:29.359 --> 18:31.660
Someone get a P.A.
to feed me baby food.

18:31.695 --> 18:35.331
Or I will drop a "D" in the greenroom.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.315
No, Pete! Why?

18:37.334 --> 18:39.484
Last night, after the show...

18:39.502 --> 18:42.454
[Cheering, rhythm instruments jingling]

18:42.488 --> 18:45.824
I went to give them a piece of my mind.

18:45.842 --> 18:47.325
Enjoy, bro.

18:47.344 --> 18:48.594

18:54.017 --> 18:57.553
♪ go down to the water

18:57.604 --> 19:00.522
there were no 1020-Gs
down there.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.107
No neck pain.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.859
No fear.

19:03.893 --> 19:07.512
Just easy livin'.

19:07.530 --> 19:09.531
Something you mainlanders
wouldn't understand.

19:09.566 --> 19:12.350
Pete, come on.

19:12.369 --> 19:14.352
Pete's dead.

19:14.371 --> 19:17.489
I'm Panama, now.

19:19.376 --> 19:20.859
Now, like any penis,

19:20.877 --> 19:23.245
Florida is very complicated.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.530
The Cubans in the South...
Very conservative.

19:25.548 --> 19:27.916
I had a lot of expensive cigars
put out on me

19:27.967 --> 19:29.668
in Miami comedy clubs.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.504
But central Florida is dominated

19:32.538 --> 19:34.556
by Jewish retirees, serial killers,

19:34.591 --> 19:37.375
and secretly gay Disney princes,

19:37.394 --> 19:39.377
all of whom love Obama.

19:39.396 --> 19:41.379
Meanwhile...

19:41.398 --> 19:44.400
In Northern Florida...

19:44.434 --> 19:45.567
Huh.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.386
The only crowds I could never figure out

19:48.405 --> 19:50.555
were in Northern Florida.

19:50.573 --> 19:51.853
One week they're laughing at me,

19:51.854 --> 19:53.725
the next week, they're laughing at me.

19:53.743 --> 19:55.560
According to this, the electorate there

19:55.578 --> 19:57.413
is impossible to predict.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.998
It's a combination
of elderly shut-ins,

20:00.033 --> 20:01.200
beach bums...

20:01.234 --> 20:03.285
Both: Bus passengers
who ran out of money...

20:03.336 --> 20:06.171
Swamp people and pirates.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.924
These people don't like
to be told what to do.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.409
They just want
to sit on the beach and drink.

20:11.428 --> 20:14.379
There motto is "unwindulax."

20:14.413 --> 20:17.549
Unwindulax.
