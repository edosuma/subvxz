(Episode 8)

00:19.799 --> 00:20.899
Are you okay?

00:21.559 --> 00:23.030
Yes, I'm fine.

00:26.639 --> 00:27.900
That was nothing.

00:39.980 --> 00:41.780
It's rather spooky.

00:46.520 --> 00:49.319
I heard earthquakes\Nrecently hit this area.

00:49.590 --> 00:50.660
It's okay.

00:50.789 --> 00:51.859
I'm here with you.

00:52.259 --> 00:53.329
A real man.

00:57.069 --> 00:58.069
Wait for me.

00:59.329 --> 01:01.200
I'll make sure\NI pass this time.

01:01.639 --> 01:02.639
Yes.

01:04.170 --> 01:06.679
Goodness, you brought\Nso much stuff.

01:06.679 --> 01:08.480
Look at\Nall these cosmetics.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.250
Do you think\Nthis is a summer camp?

01:10.250 --> 01:11.580
Goodness, alcohol?

01:12.380 --> 01:14.979
My goodness.\NCome on, take them out.

01:16.020 --> 01:18.789
Come on. Give them to me.

01:20.089 --> 01:21.089
Let's see.

01:21.390 --> 01:23.130
- It depends...\N- This is...

01:23.130 --> 01:24.559
One second.

01:24.860 --> 01:25.860
Wait.

01:29.800 --> 01:30.899
- That's...\N- What is this?

01:30.899 --> 01:32.399
That's my medicine.

01:32.399 --> 01:33.470
Exactly.

01:33.470 --> 01:35.740
You need to quit this\Nto pass the exam.

01:35.740 --> 01:37.240
Look at the way\Nyour hands are shaking.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.470
You're pretty old too.

01:38.470 --> 01:40.009
Go see a doctor, okay?

01:40.210 --> 01:41.279
All right, attention.

01:41.479 --> 01:42.640
In Cheongryul Institution,

01:42.640 --> 01:45.050
if you're caught drinking,\Nusing the internet, phone,

01:45.050 --> 01:46.479
or dating,\Nyou will be dismissed.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.850
And you will not get\Nany refunds.

01:49.589 --> 01:50.589
All right.

01:52.119 --> 01:54.059
Leave everything\Nyou don't need here...

01:54.059 --> 01:56.119
other than your\Ndetermination...

01:56.119 --> 01:58.729
to pass the exam.\NDo you understand?

02:01.199 --> 02:03.229
Come on,\Ntake out your phones.

02:03.899 --> 02:06.069
Are all boarding\Ninstitutions like this?

02:06.069 --> 02:07.240
If you get caught,\Nyou'll get kicked out.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.500
This place\Nis really weird.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.710
You want to\Ngo home, right?

02:10.369 --> 02:12.839
- Yes.\N- That's normal.

02:12.839 --> 02:15.140
He's good at\Nrunning this place.

02:15.679 --> 02:18.309
You want pass to\Ngo home quickly, right?

02:18.309 --> 02:20.149
Yes, already.

02:20.820 --> 02:23.050
That's why you sign up\Nfor these places.

02:23.349 --> 02:24.450
To get out quickly.

02:32.790 --> 02:36.529
(Queen of Mystery 2)

02:37.070 --> 02:38.099
Noo Ri.

02:39.129 --> 02:40.469
Noo Ri, where are you?

02:40.969 --> 02:42.070
It's your mommy.

02:43.409 --> 02:45.070
Where are you, Noo Ri?

02:45.640 --> 02:46.710
Noo Ri.

02:47.179 --> 02:48.710
Let's eat.

02:49.580 --> 02:50.649
Noo Ri.

02:52.050 --> 02:53.450
Noo Ri, where are you?

02:54.580 --> 02:55.580
Noo Ri.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.050
Noo Ri.

03:03.589 --> 03:06.929
Noo Ri, are you playing\Na prank on me?

03:24.379 --> 03:25.379
Noo Ri.

03:32.649 --> 03:34.020
What was that?

03:37.990 --> 03:39.629
Didn't you hear something?

03:39.629 --> 03:40.760
I'm not sure.

03:41.499 --> 03:43.129
I heard something.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.469
Did you hear something?

03:49.099 --> 03:50.869
All right, then.

03:51.339 --> 03:53.010
What do you call\Na prank...

03:53.010 --> 03:54.409
that Anne Frank pulls?

03:54.809 --> 03:56.379
It's Anne Prank.

04:10.429 --> 04:13.059
There were customers\Nwho cleaned out samples...

04:13.059 --> 04:16.099
and drunks who threw a fit\Nsaying they need food.

04:16.269 --> 04:18.999
It's me, Kim Kyung Mi,\Nwho has been nice...

04:18.999 --> 04:20.200
to those\Nobnoxious customers.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.570
I don't care\Nhow awful your jokes are.

04:21.570 --> 04:22.839
I can take them all.

04:23.940 --> 04:26.039
Okay. Since you all\Nseem to love that,

04:26.039 --> 04:27.580
I'll tell you one more.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.349
Since cars only have\Nfour doors,

04:30.950 --> 04:33.049
you can't open just\Nthree "for" someone.

04:44.789 --> 04:46.299
Gosh, my chin hurts.

04:48.229 --> 04:49.229
Kyung Mi?

04:51.700 --> 04:52.700
Kyung Mi?

04:54.539 --> 04:55.739
Kyung Mi.

04:56.940 --> 04:58.339
Kyung Mi!

05:01.479 --> 05:02.479
Yes.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.919
Do you want to\Ncome by my office?

05:08.680 --> 05:09.690
Your office here?

05:09.690 --> 05:11.950
The forensic office at\NJoongjin Police Station.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.789
Oh, really?

05:14.289 --> 05:15.690
I've always wanted\Nto go there.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.229
That's why I'm offering.

05:17.229 --> 05:18.260
When should I go?

05:18.260 --> 05:19.430
The faster, the better.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.560
Okay.

05:22.099 --> 05:23.370
Thank you, sir.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.099
I hope you can\Nkeep this as a secret...

05:29.099 --> 05:30.339
from other students.

05:31.909 --> 05:32.909
Pardon?

05:33.310 --> 05:34.310
Why?

05:35.810 --> 05:37.950
It's a dream for\Nevery student...

05:37.950 --> 05:40.320
to get to visit\Nmy work office.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.320
Pardon?

05:42.279 --> 05:44.489
Yes, of course.

05:44.489 --> 05:46.859
They will be\Ndisappointed...

05:46.859 --> 05:48.659
when they find out that\NI only invited you.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.700
You must always be\Ncautious of jealousy.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.729
Especially for\Na bright student like you.

05:56.029 --> 05:57.070
Understood?

05:57.570 --> 05:59.500
Yes, of course.

06:00.669 --> 06:01.700
Then may I have...

06:03.739 --> 06:05.239
your phone number?

06:11.950 --> 06:13.779
I do not think\Nthat's very wise.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.520
Pardon?

06:17.049 --> 06:19.349
I understand how you feel,

06:21.320 --> 06:22.589
but this is useless.

06:24.130 --> 06:26.330
Oh, I wanted to call you\Nwhen I got to...

06:26.330 --> 06:27.830
Joongjin Police Station.

06:32.529 --> 06:33.539
I do not...

06:34.839 --> 06:36.669
wish to hurt you.

06:38.469 --> 06:39.779
You can reach me...

06:40.080 --> 06:41.479
through my landline.

07:17.279 --> 07:19.250
I'm sorry. Sorry.

07:40.870 --> 07:43.310
The employee just stole\Na student's cigarette.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.580
My gosh.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.219
- Bye.\N- Okay.

07:59.690 --> 08:02.460
Darn it. It's gone again.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.330
Who did this?

08:10.969 --> 08:13.870
I should make a movie\Nabout a cigarette thief.

08:17.969 --> 08:19.010
Hey, Mi Joo.

08:19.310 --> 08:20.310
- Hey.\N- Hey.

08:22.510 --> 08:23.810
You guys came too.

08:23.810 --> 08:25.210
You are here too?

08:26.649 --> 08:27.680
Did you also get...

08:28.279 --> 08:30.520
a 50 percent discount?

08:31.489 --> 08:33.859
I got 60 percent off.

08:33.859 --> 08:35.489
What?

08:36.489 --> 08:39.389
- What about you?\N- I didn't come to study.

08:40.359 --> 08:42.400
I'm going to work\Npart-time around here.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.800
Gi Beom said I'm getting\Na 50 percent discount...

08:44.969 --> 08:47.499
because he put in a word\Nfor me with his uncle.

08:47.499 --> 08:49.710
If you're interested,\NI'll talk to my uncle.

08:49.710 --> 08:51.869
You can probably get...

08:52.109 --> 08:54.139
a 50 percent discount.

08:54.810 --> 08:57.450
He told me that\Nit was his aunt.

08:57.450 --> 08:58.450
What?

08:59.410 --> 09:00.580
That kid.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.320
What is this?

09:02.580 --> 09:04.150
Is this a fraud?

09:08.660 --> 09:10.560
It's my habit.

09:11.430 --> 09:14.400
What was your\Ndiscount rate?

09:14.700 --> 09:15.900
Was there a discount?

09:16.530 --> 09:18.099
I heard there are many\Non the waiting list,

09:18.099 --> 09:19.530
so I paid\Nextra 10 percent.

09:19.530 --> 09:20.639
You did?

09:23.310 --> 09:25.570
It's such a relief.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.239
You guys are here too.

09:30.150 --> 09:33.379
You're famous as a suspect\Nfor that murder case.

09:33.379 --> 09:35.219
Get rid of your hand.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.489
Are you her boyfriend?

09:38.519 --> 09:40.920
What? Are you serious?

09:41.359 --> 09:42.489
You guys are dating?

09:45.629 --> 09:47.499
Si Hwan, hang in there\Na little longer.

09:47.499 --> 09:50.670
Sure. You know\NI'm a good leader.

09:51.099 --> 09:53.339
I used to be a teaching\Nassistant in big schools.

09:53.339 --> 09:54.999
This is nothing.

09:54.999 --> 09:56.369
I'm sorry, but...

09:56.369 --> 09:58.440
do you realize that you\Nget kicked out for dating?

09:58.440 --> 10:01.210
Should I go tell\Nthe superintendent?

10:01.739 --> 10:02.879
Alcohol is not allowed.

10:02.879 --> 10:04.050
The Internet\Nis not allowed.

10:04.050 --> 10:06.479
Cellphone is not allowed.\NDating is not allowed.

10:07.080 --> 10:10.050
But it seems like\Nflirting is allowed.

10:10.050 --> 10:11.190
She's right.

10:11.589 --> 10:13.119
You guys look great.

10:13.790 --> 10:16.359
You looked tired\Nback in Noryang-dong.

10:16.989 --> 10:18.859
You must be happy that\Nyour faces look great.

10:18.859 --> 10:22.099
I told you to take off\Nthose glasses first.

10:22.999 --> 10:25.969
I can't even bring\Ncameras in here.

10:27.139 --> 10:28.739
Excuse me, sir.

10:31.570 --> 10:34.139
He has a hidden camera.

10:34.339 --> 10:35.440
A hidden camera?

10:37.080 --> 10:38.749
What do you think is this?

10:39.879 --> 10:42.150
- What is he saying?\N- Go back to your room.

10:42.150 --> 10:43.489
Don't hang out in groups.

10:43.489 --> 10:45.219
He'll be here again\Nfor sure.

10:45.219 --> 10:47.119
- Go Si Hwan.\N- Yes?

10:47.519 --> 10:48.960
You're not here\Nas a student, right?

10:49.560 --> 10:51.489
You're here as staff.\NGet back to work.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.999
- See you later.\N- I'll get going.

10:57.769 --> 10:58.830
Let's go.

11:00.969 --> 11:02.239
Have you seen Han Gi Yong?

11:02.469 --> 11:03.469
Han Gi Yong?

11:03.469 --> 11:05.139
I asked if you have seen\NHan Gi Yong!

11:05.639 --> 11:06.710
I haven't seen him.

11:06.710 --> 11:08.109
Where did he go?

11:08.109 --> 11:09.139
There's a special class...

11:09.139 --> 11:10.249
given by\Nthe Police University.

11:10.249 --> 11:11.410
He must be there.

11:12.109 --> 11:13.619
He wasn't there!\NI already checked.

11:21.560 --> 11:23.030
What's his intention?

11:23.460 --> 11:25.359
It's not like\Nhe's watching me.

11:25.359 --> 11:27.430
Lieutenant Ha,\Nyou're not my type...

11:27.430 --> 11:29.300
regardless of my\Nsexual preference.

11:30.530 --> 11:31.599
Pardon?

11:32.900 --> 11:35.369
You've been\Nglaring at me...

11:35.369 --> 11:37.339
for 75 minutes.

11:37.339 --> 11:39.780
I hope you can\Nget back to work.

11:40.810 --> 11:42.180
I wasn't looking at you.

11:42.180 --> 11:43.810
I was working on my\Ninvestigation plans.

11:45.410 --> 11:47.619
Is there a new case?

11:47.619 --> 11:49.550
There is one woman\Nwho's gone missing.

11:49.550 --> 11:51.489
She said she'll be in\Na boarding institution.

11:51.749 --> 11:53.089
But I can't reach her.

11:55.060 --> 11:58.129
Did Ms. Yoo go to\Na boarding institution?

12:01.629 --> 12:03.969
You're good.\NHow did you know?

12:04.700 --> 12:07.200
You are an easy man,\NLieutenant Ha.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.570
I can read your mind.

12:09.469 --> 12:11.540
Is he in contact with her?

12:12.009 --> 12:13.210
Something's suspicious.

12:13.479 --> 12:15.940
Why Joongjin Police\NStation? Why Unit Two...

12:15.940 --> 12:17.050
of all places?

12:19.080 --> 12:21.920
Start investigating only\Nif there's a report.

12:21.920 --> 12:25.320
Maybe she disappeared\Nto avoid your calls.

12:26.589 --> 12:28.920
It's her who started\Nbothering me first.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.389
Why would she\Navoid my calls?

12:30.389 --> 12:32.060
I'm the one\Nwho should disappear.

12:32.690 --> 12:35.629
Then there's no point\Nfor you to find her.

12:35.759 --> 12:38.200
I wasn't looking for her.\NMy gosh.

12:41.839 --> 12:43.670
Are you on your way\Nto look for Ms. Yoo?

12:44.109 --> 12:45.239
I'm going home.

12:48.910 --> 12:51.550
Did I do something wrong\Nto Seol Ok?

12:59.719 --> 13:02.359
Hey, Detective Ha.\NI was looking for you.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.989
Get the finger print\Nresults from Mr. Hwang.

13:05.889 --> 13:07.359
You are out of your mind.

13:07.359 --> 13:08.560
I'm not in Unit One\Nanymore.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.300
Ask Constable Shin\Nto do it for you.

13:10.300 --> 13:13.440
What? Mr. Hwang?

13:14.400 --> 13:16.869
Everyone was wondering\Nhow you passed the test.

13:16.869 --> 13:18.910
It's good you're lucky\Nwhen you're not smart.

13:18.910 --> 13:21.139
Be a good daughter\Nto your father.

13:22.479 --> 13:25.580
Okay, maybe not.\NYou're still in shock.

13:26.249 --> 13:28.180
Then get the result\Nby yourself.

13:28.249 --> 13:29.790
By the way, they don't\Nserve tea for you there.

13:29.790 --> 13:31.749
You should drink it\Nbefore you go.

13:31.849 --> 13:33.119
Okay.

13:33.519 --> 13:34.989
I'd want to hear\Nabout the result too.

13:34.989 --> 13:36.960
Send it to my email,\Nwill you?

13:41.200 --> 13:44.099
That scumbag is still\Nordering me what to do.

13:49.769 --> 13:51.839
Did you have lunch?

13:52.810 --> 13:54.910
You're not in place\Nto worry about me.

13:55.639 --> 13:58.310
I have nothing else\Nto talk about here.

13:59.349 --> 14:00.820
You look fine, though.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.790
It's not so bad here.

14:05.019 --> 14:07.660
I get to talk to you\None-on-one too.

14:07.660 --> 14:10.129
You're being cheesy.

14:10.129 --> 14:12.589
Hey, to me,

14:12.589 --> 14:15.030
you're still a little boy.

14:15.099 --> 14:17.369
Like a five-year-old boy\Nwho asked me...

14:17.369 --> 14:18.629
to not go to school\Nand play with you.

14:18.629 --> 14:19.670
Ji Seung.

14:19.769 --> 14:21.999
I was independent\Nsince I was three.

14:21.999 --> 14:23.670
Oh, were you?

14:23.670 --> 14:26.540
My baby Wan Seung was\Nindependent since three.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.339
I didn't know.

14:29.650 --> 14:33.249
Do you happen to know\NSecretary Kim?

14:33.879 --> 14:35.150
Secretary Kim?

14:37.389 --> 14:40.089
Who sent this?

14:40.160 --> 14:41.889
(Secretary Kim)

14:41.889 --> 14:43.089
Secretary Kim?

14:44.330 --> 14:46.359
That person will be\Nthe first to attack us...

14:46.359 --> 14:49.769
when we get weak.

14:51.869 --> 14:53.839
No, I don't know Secretary\NKim.

14:53.839 --> 14:55.139
I've never heard the name.

14:55.639 --> 14:56.769
Who is Secretary Kim?

14:56.940 --> 14:59.369
Is that person\Nrelated to this?

15:00.339 --> 15:01.879
Never mind\Nif you don't know.

15:04.379 --> 15:06.450
How's Dad?

15:06.450 --> 15:09.320
You know well that\Nhe's a strong man.

15:09.379 --> 15:12.420
I know Dad was wrong,\Nbut you were too.

15:12.420 --> 15:14.190
Come back\Nas a family member.

15:14.290 --> 15:17.389
Blood is thicker\Nthan anything.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.330
You sound just like Dad.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.700
Hey, it's natural sons\Ntake after their fathers.

15:26.499 --> 15:28.700
Anyway, what happened\Nto you?

15:28.700 --> 15:30.639
You're the president of\NHa and Jung Law Firm.

15:30.810 --> 15:33.040
I'll be out tomorrow.\NDon't worry.

15:33.109 --> 15:34.280
It's actually good.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.950
I got to learn about\Nhow victims feel.

15:37.609 --> 15:41.580
It's a good chance for me\Nto be a better lawyer.

15:43.089 --> 15:44.550
Even so,\Ndon't come here too often.

15:44.550 --> 15:47.560
My baby is worried\Nabout his brother.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.460
Can I come here\Nfrom time to time?

15:49.460 --> 15:52.129
Don't treat me like a boy.\NMy goodness.

15:52.460 --> 15:53.999
You must be busy.\NYou should go.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.229
- Bye.\N- Bye.

16:18.950 --> 16:20.359
What? Hey.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.030
Did I see it wrong?

16:34.099 --> 16:36.609
The brothers are closer\Nthan I thought.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.839
(Lecture Room 2)

17:10.839 --> 17:11.969
Are you looking\Nfor someone?

17:11.969 --> 17:13.180
Hey, you're here.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.410
A student is missing.

17:15.479 --> 17:16.680
Who?

17:19.509 --> 17:21.380
You wouldn't know\Neven if I told you.

17:23.489 --> 17:24.920
Han Gi Yong?

17:25.219 --> 17:26.319
How did you know?

17:26.319 --> 17:27.759
Someone was looking\Nfor him earlier too.

17:27.759 --> 17:29.120
Have you seen Han Gi Yong?

17:29.559 --> 17:30.690
Han Gi Yong?

17:30.690 --> 17:32.390
I asked if you have seen\NHan Gi Yong!

17:33.029 --> 17:35.999
Isn't that man who said\Nsomeone's stalking him?

17:35.999 --> 17:37.630
Yes, he's the one.

17:38.499 --> 17:39.799
Have you heard this?

17:40.100 --> 17:42.969
Today marks one week.

17:43.239 --> 17:44.610
One week?

17:44.840 --> 17:45.910
What week?

17:45.910 --> 17:48.140
Everyone here\Nwas talking about it.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.549
- Have you heard about it?\N- What?

17:51.549 --> 17:53.479
- Han Gi Yong.\N- What about him?

17:53.479 --> 17:55.479
Today marks the\Nseventh day.

17:55.479 --> 17:57.789
- Today's the day.\N- My gosh.

17:57.789 --> 17:58.950
- It's scary.\N- Gosh.

17:59.519 --> 18:01.620
- He can't be...\N- I can't believe it.

18:04.729 --> 18:07.100
Han Gi Yong and\NKang Joo Yeon were dating.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.400
Then he ditched her.

18:09.460 --> 18:10.799
Did he cheat on her?

18:10.799 --> 18:13.269
- They really dated?\N- Yes, they did.

18:13.269 --> 18:15.840
There was a stalker\Nwho followed him.

18:15.999 --> 18:17.170
A stalker?

18:17.170 --> 18:21.210
Yes. The stalker's name\Nis Kang Joo Yeon, right?

18:21.340 --> 18:23.110
Yes, that's right.

18:24.850 --> 18:26.680
Let's have a word.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.079
She even followed him\Nto the class...

18:28.079 --> 18:29.420
because he wouldn't\Nsee her at all.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.719
Who are you to intrude us?

18:31.819 --> 18:34.819
I like you too.\NWhy can't I date you?

18:35.059 --> 18:37.630
There are people who\Nwitnessed the fight.

18:37.630 --> 18:39.729
What are you doing there?

18:40.029 --> 18:42.329
Hey, stop!

18:42.360 --> 18:44.170
I'll kill you!

18:47.840 --> 18:48.900
Hey!

18:50.069 --> 18:52.410
The stalker\Ngot kicked out.

18:52.710 --> 18:54.440
It was a hectic day.

19:11.329 --> 19:12.529
Hey, you.

19:12.729 --> 19:13.729
You.

19:14.430 --> 19:16.160
Let go. Let me go!

19:17.029 --> 19:18.029
Just wait here.

19:18.029 --> 19:19.870
I'll come and kill you\Nafter a week.

19:19.870 --> 19:22.499
I'll become a ghost\Nand kill you for certain!

19:22.700 --> 19:23.809
I'll kill you too!

19:43.190 --> 19:45.329
Is something wrong,\NJoo Yeon?

19:46.360 --> 19:47.630
I have an upset stomach.

19:47.630 --> 19:49.029
Let me get off the car\Nfor a minute.

19:49.299 --> 19:50.299
Okay.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.170
Are you feeling\Nany better now?

19:58.039 --> 19:59.069
I'm all right.

19:59.880 --> 20:00.880
What should we do?

20:03.009 --> 20:04.009
Hold on a second.

20:09.079 --> 20:10.090
Hello?

20:10.620 --> 20:12.319
I'm not at the office now.

20:14.019 --> 20:15.789
Joo Yeon.

20:16.329 --> 20:17.960
Joo Yeon!

20:24.930 --> 20:26.100
That day,

20:27.900 --> 20:29.640
the stalker\Nkilled herself.

20:30.610 --> 20:32.469
The police and the\Nresidents of this town...

20:32.469 --> 20:34.340
searched everywhere\Nnear the site,

20:34.610 --> 20:35.710
but they couldn't\Nfind the bodies.

20:35.710 --> 20:37.579
Stop it. It's scaring me.

20:37.579 --> 20:38.680
Stop talking.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.450
I'm hungry.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.549
You're not scared?

20:44.489 --> 20:46.319
There's nothing to be\Nscared about ghosts.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.360
Things like serial killers\Nare scary.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.559
So when is our meal time?

20:51.559 --> 20:53.360
It's past the meal time.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.130
I have to sleep\Nwithout eating anything?

20:55.660 --> 20:56.670
It's scary.

20:57.370 --> 20:59.100
This is the real fear.

20:59.999 --> 21:01.170
- Hey.\N- Goodness.

21:01.170 --> 21:02.539
We should've eaten\Nsomething on our way.

21:02.539 --> 21:05.610
How could you think about\Neating at this timing?

21:05.969 --> 21:07.239
I'm scared to death.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.110
I'm scared to death too.

21:18.819 --> 21:19.860
Gosh.

21:21.090 --> 21:22.420
Did he go somewhere?

21:23.930 --> 21:25.029
Mr. Hwang?

21:26.130 --> 21:27.200
What is it?

21:27.600 --> 21:28.600
You startled me.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.269
Is the final fingerprint\Nidentification result...

21:34.269 --> 21:36.100
of the Noryang-dong case\Nout?

21:36.569 --> 21:37.569
Mr. Gye.

21:38.039 --> 21:39.579
Where are you standing\Nright now?

21:39.940 --> 21:40.940
Pardon?

21:41.840 --> 21:44.610
The office of Scientific\NInvestigation Unit?

21:44.850 --> 21:45.910
Stop!

21:46.779 --> 21:49.620
Don't move a step\Nfrom there.

21:50.590 --> 21:51.719
I swept and mopped\Nthe office after a while.

21:51.719 --> 21:54.489
I even sanitized it with\Na natural high-gloss wax.

21:54.860 --> 21:57.160
And you stepped on it\Nwith your dirty shoes.

21:59.559 --> 22:00.999
They're new,\Nso they're clean.

22:00.999 --> 22:01.999
Wait.

22:02.660 --> 22:04.069
Where did you get\Nthose shoes?

22:05.630 --> 22:06.870
They're directly\Nimported goods.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.279
Mr. Gye, do you want\Nsome tea?

22:19.880 --> 22:21.049
No, thank you.

22:21.350 --> 22:22.680
You must be bored.

22:28.019 --> 22:29.789
What was that for?

22:32.259 --> 22:33.729
I don't want to get\Ninterrupted by anyone...

22:34.460 --> 22:36.829
at least in this moment.

22:38.100 --> 22:41.370
Why are you doing\Nthis to me?

22:42.100 --> 22:45.769
"Recruiting members of\NViolent Crimes Unit Two."

22:45.969 --> 22:48.910
"Mr. Woo Sung Ha of\NViolent Crimes Unit Two"?

22:50.380 --> 22:52.749
Mr. Woo is recruiting\Nhis team members?

22:53.749 --> 22:55.120
I should apply for it.

22:55.380 --> 22:58.590
Yes! I'll be\Nin the same unit with him.

23:07.160 --> 23:08.799
You're making\Na great contribution...

23:08.799 --> 23:10.930
to the national scientific\Ninvestigation field.

23:11.130 --> 23:12.870
I'm nearly\Nat the last stage of...

23:12.870 --> 23:14.269
the additional database\Nsecuring process.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.410
I see.

23:19.539 --> 23:20.710
Okay.

23:21.579 --> 23:22.640
It's done.

23:22.779 --> 23:24.110
How should I repay this?

23:24.110 --> 23:25.249
It's my pleasure.

23:25.249 --> 23:26.779
Shall I give you\Na piece of advice?

23:27.279 --> 23:29.380
If you want to\Ncommit a crime,

23:29.380 --> 23:31.120
make sure that you wear\Nanother pair.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.259
You'll get caught right\Naway if you wear these.

23:38.890 --> 23:40.130
These are expensive.

23:40.660 --> 23:43.630
How could you treat\Nmy babies this way?

23:53.640 --> 23:55.880
Don't others say\Nthat you're slow-witted?

23:56.079 --> 23:58.650
- What?\N- I'm very busy now.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.079
Do you really have to\Ndo that in my office?

24:04.420 --> 24:06.519
The fingerprint\Nidentification result...

24:07.620 --> 24:09.289
This is a limited edition.

24:24.509 --> 24:26.039
Let's buy some bread.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.150
Only male students\Ncan use the cafeteria now.

24:30.150 --> 24:31.450
(Cafeteria Regulations)

24:31.450 --> 24:33.680
Men and women have to buy\Nbread at different times?

24:35.519 --> 24:37.620
They use separate floors,

24:37.620 --> 24:39.350
restrooms,\Nand shower rooms too.

24:39.350 --> 24:41.289
They can never run\Ninto each other in here.

24:41.289 --> 24:42.690
- I see.\N- Gosh.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.090
This must be a fire pit.

24:44.090 --> 24:45.829
It's a fire pit indeed.

24:45.890 --> 24:47.499
They barely see each\Nother during meal times.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.969
Oh, there's the gym.

24:50.969 --> 24:53.940
What? You'll work out?\NAt what time?

24:53.940 --> 24:56.670
Is the gym for\Nboth men and women?

24:56.910 --> 24:58.370
Yes, it's the only place\Nin here.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.410
I guess I should\Nwork out hard.

25:01.410 --> 25:03.749
I need physical strength\Nto study.

25:03.749 --> 25:04.749
Right?

25:05.850 --> 25:07.079
Where is it?

25:07.279 --> 25:08.279
Over there.

25:15.690 --> 25:17.360
I wonder\Nif she might be upset...

25:18.259 --> 25:20.029
that I came in her room\Nwithout permission.

25:22.829 --> 25:24.700
She must've left\Nsome traces.

25:30.569 --> 25:32.370
She likes this kind\Nof stuff?

25:37.180 --> 25:38.180
(Taxi)

25:40.049 --> 25:41.319
Your parents\Nare related...

25:41.979 --> 25:43.850
to the Sillim-dong case,\Naren't they?

25:45.019 --> 25:46.489
The taxi driver and his\Nwife killed themselves.

25:49.489 --> 25:50.630
I know they're\Nyour parents.

25:52.900 --> 25:54.200
They didn't\Nkill themselves.

25:56.029 --> 25:57.700
They were murdered\Nfor certain.

25:58.430 --> 25:59.969
I'll reveal it for you.

25:59.969 --> 26:01.340
I'll do it myself.

26:11.910 --> 26:12.920
What?

26:14.350 --> 26:16.019
"Chunhong-gun, Wonju,\NGangwon Province"?

26:16.019 --> 26:18.249
Don't look for me\Nunless it's urgent.

26:18.650 --> 26:19.789
This is why\NI couldn't find her...

26:19.789 --> 26:20.890
anywhere in Noryang-dong.

26:20.989 --> 26:22.390
What kind\Nof institution...

26:22.390 --> 26:23.789
is in the mountains\Nof Gangwon Province?

26:24.759 --> 26:27.259
Did she get fooled by\Nsomeone by any chance?

26:28.799 --> 26:30.799
She's too naive that\Nshe gets fooled easily.

26:42.509 --> 26:43.579
Han Gi Yong...

26:44.979 --> 26:47.819
Han Gi Yong.\NHan Gi Yong is dead.

27:13.680 --> 27:14.840
What should I do?

27:15.279 --> 27:16.350
What do I do?

27:17.210 --> 27:18.410
A ghost has shown up.

27:18.410 --> 27:20.850
A ghost has showed up\Nand killed...

27:21.620 --> 27:24.090
both Noo Ri\Nand Han Gi Yong.

27:24.090 --> 27:25.319
Wait.\NI'll come and kill you...

27:25.319 --> 27:26.789
- after a week.\N- Shut it.

27:26.789 --> 27:29.059
I'll become a ghost\Nand kill you for certain.

27:29.059 --> 27:30.160
Stop.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.059
A week will pass quickly.

27:32.059 --> 27:34.700
And I'll kill you\Nall then.

27:34.900 --> 27:35.999
Die!

27:48.279 --> 27:50.309
- Noo Ri.\N- In Ae.

27:50.450 --> 27:51.979
- Noo Ri.\N- You can't go.

27:51.979 --> 27:54.450
- Calm down.\N- Let me go.

27:54.450 --> 27:57.650
- No. What should I do?\N- Calm down and listen.

27:57.650 --> 27:59.120
It's too dangerous.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.420
- It's dangerous.\N- Stop doing this to me!

28:01.890 --> 28:04.989
Calm down\Nand listen to me, In Ae.

28:05.090 --> 28:07.660
In Ae! In Ae!

28:17.769 --> 28:19.710
Why on earth\Nis the institution...

28:20.309 --> 28:22.140
in such a deep mountain?

28:22.739 --> 28:24.049
Did she get enslaved...

28:24.410 --> 28:26.549
in the mountain like\Nthe slaves on salt farms?

28:27.479 --> 28:28.650
Goodness.

28:39.729 --> 28:41.430
The news said that this\Narea had an earthquake...

28:41.430 --> 28:43.829
and the road was blocked.\NI guess it's true.

28:44.229 --> 28:45.900
How should\NI go through this?

28:46.269 --> 28:47.769
There's no way.

28:49.239 --> 28:50.239
I can't.

28:57.350 --> 28:58.350
Still,

28:59.210 --> 29:00.719
I should help her\Nget a job.

29:03.850 --> 29:05.150
Let's see.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.360
Do I owe something for her\Nfrom my past life?

29:12.829 --> 29:15.259
This is more dangerous\Nthan catching criminals.

29:20.370 --> 29:22.069
I'm too old for this.

29:25.710 --> 29:28.309
Wasn't it enough\Nthat I saved her life?

29:28.380 --> 29:30.180
Do I have to\Nfind her a job too?

29:30.549 --> 29:33.319
Why am I going through\Nthis much trouble? Darn.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.529
Kang Joo Yeon is back.\NThat crazy woman...

29:47.960 --> 29:49.600
is back here to kill me.

29:53.039 --> 29:54.100
Hey.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.100
Excuse me!

29:57.509 --> 30:00.210
The road is closed.\NHey, the road is blocked!

30:05.279 --> 30:06.549
By any chance,

30:07.079 --> 30:09.549
is the institution down\Nthat road? Could you...

30:09.549 --> 30:11.019
Excuse me...

30:13.319 --> 30:16.160
That was cheap. Why\Ncan't they give me a lift?

30:19.430 --> 30:20.960
It's not that hard\Nto give me a ride.

30:22.930 --> 30:24.670
- Look over there.\N- Oh, my gosh.

30:25.769 --> 30:27.870
- What happened?\N- Quiet down.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.539
Excuse me.

30:40.350 --> 30:41.380
He's really dead.

30:41.380 --> 30:43.390
- Where?\N- What's going on?

30:43.390 --> 30:44.789
No one touch him...

30:45.920 --> 30:47.690
until the police get here.

30:47.989 --> 30:50.930
Cars can't come in\Nbecause of the rockslide.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.529
The police can't come\Nwithin the night.

30:53.529 --> 30:55.130
If you damage the scene,

30:55.130 --> 30:57.069
the initial investigation\Nwill be tougher.

30:57.069 --> 30:58.900
Shouldn't we put up\Nthe police line?

30:59.600 --> 31:01.569
There's something\Nwe can use. I'll do it.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.850
If we turn the camera,\Nwe can keep an eye on him.

31:10.850 --> 31:12.279
I'll get that.

31:23.329 --> 31:24.559
I'll go to\Nthe security office...

31:24.559 --> 31:26.529
to see if the video\Nis coming in clear.

31:26.529 --> 31:27.630
Be careful.

31:27.960 --> 31:30.430
There are security cameras\Neverywhere in here.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.430
He doesn't need\Nto be careful.

31:32.729 --> 31:34.170
But someone has died...

31:34.799 --> 31:37.110
even though there are\Ncameras everywhere.

31:37.910 --> 31:39.239
Is this murder?

31:39.940 --> 31:41.539
Maybe he fell,\Nhit something, and died.

31:41.739 --> 31:43.979
He might have slipped\Nand hit his head.

31:44.710 --> 31:46.110
Do you really think so?

31:53.920 --> 31:56.059
He barely started to run.

32:05.430 --> 32:07.170
How did she\Ncome here by herself?

32:07.900 --> 32:09.640
She's really something.

32:16.210 --> 32:17.610
I don't see any lights.

32:21.180 --> 32:22.989
Why is an institution\Non top of a mountain?

32:24.549 --> 32:26.150
Just wait\Nuntil I catch her.

32:26.660 --> 32:28.090
I'm taking her with me\Nright away.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.460
Well, I guess it's here.

32:34.460 --> 32:35.660
My gosh.

32:51.350 --> 32:52.410
Excuse me.

32:53.049 --> 32:54.249
Is anybody here?

33:00.019 --> 33:01.160
Excuse me!

33:05.390 --> 33:08.600
Why did they put cameras\Nup after every two steps?

33:08.960 --> 33:10.569
No one can\Nget out of this place.

33:11.469 --> 33:12.769
Is this really\Nan institution?

33:13.940 --> 33:16.469
Man, what a tough day.\NJust you wait, lady.

33:16.940 --> 33:18.069
Hey, lady!

33:24.309 --> 33:25.809
(Lecture Room 2)

33:34.219 --> 33:35.690
Where is everyone?

33:41.660 --> 33:43.229
My gosh, I'm so tired.

33:44.829 --> 33:46.130
Be quiet!

33:52.309 --> 33:53.880
Be quiet, everyone.

34:00.079 --> 34:01.249
Excuse me.

34:03.090 --> 34:04.249
Lady.

34:07.059 --> 34:08.190
Detective Ha?

34:09.690 --> 34:11.460
What brings you here?

34:11.460 --> 34:13.929
I want to ask you.\NWhat are you doing here?

34:14.300 --> 34:15.630
What is this?

34:15.800 --> 34:17.800
I was so worried because\NI couldn't reach you.

34:23.869 --> 34:25.070
Is he dead?

34:26.610 --> 34:28.210
Why is there\Na dead body here?

34:28.440 --> 34:31.010
You always get involved\Nin these cases.

34:31.010 --> 34:32.920
I'm with the police.\NPlease move.

34:33.179 --> 34:35.619
I came all the way here\Nto find another dead body.

34:36.150 --> 34:38.050
I must be destined\Nto become a detective.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.960
You don't get\Nany signals here.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.530
Why is he dead?

34:44.860 --> 34:47.998
We have to find out why,\Nstarting now.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.400
I can tell by the way\Nyour eyes are widened...

34:51.400 --> 34:52.940
that you won't pass\Nthe test this time either.

34:59.940 --> 35:01.880
There are\N230 security cameras here.

35:02.340 --> 35:04.579
It'll take at least\Na month to analyze these.

35:04.949 --> 35:06.579
This is like a prison.

35:06.579 --> 35:08.320
There are no blind spots.

35:08.579 --> 35:11.949
There aren't any cameras\Nin the employees' office.

35:12.490 --> 35:15.659
Yes, the cameras are there\Nto watch over students.

35:16.119 --> 35:18.329
The employees' privacy\Nmust be protected.

35:18.530 --> 35:21.329
But we still sleep\Nin the same dorm rooms...

35:21.329 --> 35:22.900
as the students\Nfor their convenience.

35:23.130 --> 35:25.369
A place that only keeps\Nthe employees' privacy.

35:25.929 --> 35:27.599
It's like a prison.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.809
An expensive one.\N1,700 dollars a month.

35:31.639 --> 35:34.210
What? You're paying them\N1,700 dollars a month?

35:34.809 --> 35:36.010
Give me half of that.

35:36.010 --> 35:37.479
I'll keep my eyes on you\N24 hours a day.

35:37.479 --> 35:40.679
It's all because of you\Nthat I failed the test.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.019
Then give me 500 dollars.\NI'll tutor you too.

35:44.019 --> 35:46.050
I mean, I cook too.

35:46.050 --> 35:47.820
What's the difference?

35:49.159 --> 35:50.260
How's 400 dollars?

35:51.460 --> 35:52.590
Then 300 dollars?

35:54.229 --> 35:56.769
What was Han Gi Yong like?

35:58.269 --> 35:59.769
Han Gi Yong?

36:06.409 --> 36:09.809
Two students recently got\Ninto a dating incident.

36:12.010 --> 36:13.749
Dating isn't an incident.

36:14.079 --> 36:16.519
You get kicked out\Nif you start dating.

36:17.420 --> 36:20.559
I'll let you date too.\NHow's 300 dollars?

36:20.760 --> 36:21.820
200 dollars?

36:23.789 --> 36:25.630
Are you referring to...

36:25.960 --> 36:28.530
the incident with\NKang Joo Yeon?

36:28.900 --> 36:29.999
Have you heard?

36:29.999 --> 36:33.099
I heard she killed herself\Na week ago.

36:34.139 --> 36:35.570
That's a rumor.

36:37.269 --> 36:38.639
She did get kicked out.

36:39.409 --> 36:42.179
I'll become a ghost\Nand kill you for certain.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.380
I'll kill you too!

36:43.849 --> 36:46.179
Let go of me. Let go.

36:48.220 --> 36:49.320
Let go!

36:58.530 --> 37:00.530
I calmed her down\Nand sent her home.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.510
Joo Yeon.

37:11.309 --> 37:12.470
You're pretty.

37:13.639 --> 37:15.309
Find a guy who'll\Nfind you worthy.

37:19.010 --> 37:20.150
Thanks.

37:21.650 --> 37:23.150
That was the last time\NI saw her.

37:24.150 --> 37:25.590
That's weird.

37:25.849 --> 37:28.059
Why was there a rumor\Nabout her killing herself?

37:28.519 --> 37:30.929
The students were probably\Nbored stuck in here,

37:30.929 --> 37:32.829
so they probably\Nmade that up.

37:33.329 --> 37:36.099
It's spooky at nights with\Nanimal cries and stuff.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.630
It's the perfect place to\Nmake up ghost stories.

37:38.630 --> 37:40.170
Then is this\Nonly a coincidence?

37:40.999 --> 37:44.440
What about Mr. Han dying\Nright after a week?

37:45.670 --> 37:47.880
He probably died of\Na heart attack.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.309
There's no ghost.

37:49.309 --> 37:51.749
Ghost, my foot.

37:52.679 --> 37:55.349
Anyway, may I see\Nthe security footage?

37:55.880 --> 37:56.990
Sure.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.090
There was no make-up class\Nfor criminal law.

38:35.090 --> 38:37.729
Han Gi Yong was the only\None who used this place.

38:38.530 --> 38:40.260
The key suspect must be...

38:40.260 --> 38:42.130
someone\Nwho found him first.

39:02.119 --> 39:05.289
But they only stayed here\Nfor one minute.

39:05.820 --> 39:08.289
Han Gi Yong. He's dead.

39:13.130 --> 39:14.699
Can a person\Nkill another person...

39:14.900 --> 39:16.499
in just a minute\Nand a half?

39:21.869 --> 39:23.869
It took only\N20 seconds for her...

39:24.110 --> 39:25.309
to stand in front of\Nthe dead body.

39:34.749 --> 39:37.220
She was shocked as\Nif she's seen a ghost.

39:37.220 --> 39:39.190
If she killed him\Naccidentally,

39:39.190 --> 39:40.490
she could have been\Nshocked...

39:40.490 --> 39:41.789
by what she's done.

39:42.420 --> 39:44.229
Han Gi Yong was already\Ncollapsed on the floor.

39:48.900 --> 39:50.699
If it were Park In Ae\Nwho killed him,

39:50.699 --> 39:53.070
it would have taken her\Nonly 20 seconds.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.440
If she used either\Na shot or poison,

39:55.639 --> 39:57.570
it sounds possible.

39:58.539 --> 40:00.710
The surveillance camera\Nalone isn't enough.

40:03.710 --> 40:04.749
Then...

40:05.849 --> 40:08.050
Let's go look for\NPark In Ae.

40:08.050 --> 40:10.420
- It's her, right?\N- Yes.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.590
The number you have dialed\Nisn't available.

40:17.590 --> 40:20.599
My gosh, why isn't he\Npicking up my call?

40:20.900 --> 40:22.630
He should be here.

40:24.829 --> 40:26.130
- Hello.\N- Welcome.

40:26.130 --> 40:27.369
Hello.

40:28.070 --> 40:29.909
- Hello.\N- Hi.

Gosh, hello!

41:58.860 --> 42:00.360
Excuse me.

42:01.760 --> 42:04.300
May I ask you a favor?

42:04.300 --> 42:05.900
Sure, what can I\Ndo for you?

42:06.570 --> 42:09.909
I'd like to take part\Nin the parking service.

42:10.039 --> 42:13.510
May I do the service\Nfor just today?

42:13.780 --> 42:15.380
Oh, I see.

42:16.579 --> 42:18.309
It's a pity, but...

42:18.309 --> 42:20.679
I can't dominate a\Nservice to myself.

- My goodness. Thank you.\N- No problem.

Have we?\NI can't recall it.

42:31.690 --> 42:32.729
Right.

42:33.729 --> 42:35.599
Are you from...

42:36.030 --> 42:37.729
- Intelligence Agency?\N- Yes.

Oh, I know.

Are you... Kang...

42:46.780 --> 42:48.979
- Hello.\N- What a coincidence.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.050
You were in Intelligence\NAgency, right?

- Yes, I was.\N- I see.

- My goodness.\N- It's good to see you.

43:38.130 --> 43:39.929

43:45.800 --> 43:46.869
Landslides have cut off\Nthe telephone lines...

43:46.869 --> 43:50.010
in the nearby villages and\Nboarding institutions.

43:50.010 --> 43:51.869
The communication is also\Nreported to be cut off.

43:52.170 --> 43:53.179
A boarding institution?

43:53.179 --> 43:54.510
Disaster and Safety\NManagement Department...

43:54.510 --> 43:56.650
will check\Non upcoming aftershocks.

43:56.909 --> 44:00.150
Inspector Woo, may I ask\Nfor your autograph?

44:00.349 --> 44:01.979
What autograph?\NI'm a policeman too.

44:03.119 --> 44:04.349
He's so cynical.

44:04.990 --> 44:05.990
You're new here.

44:05.990 --> 44:07.860
Do you want me to show you\Naround the company?

44:09.019 --> 44:10.030
"Company"?

44:10.460 --> 44:12.559
We're just salarymen.

44:12.559 --> 44:13.659
It's a company then.

44:17.769 --> 44:19.170
Listen, Constable Shin.

44:19.499 --> 44:21.539
A civil servant without\Nsense of duty...

44:21.699 --> 44:22.869
is a salaryman.

44:23.440 --> 44:24.740
But every policeman...

44:25.210 --> 44:26.740
has an honorable duty.

44:32.650 --> 44:35.119
He's so cool.

44:35.679 --> 44:37.050
Gosh, be careful.

44:37.820 --> 44:39.619
He's getting ready\Nfor the literary award...

44:39.619 --> 44:41.059
from Kyungan Daily.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.460
Constable Shin should\Nnote this and run away.

44:44.530 --> 44:46.300
He has a good command\Nof information.

44:51.229 --> 44:52.900
Ms. Park In Ae.\NThis is the police.

44:53.369 --> 44:56.039
You were the first one to\Nfind Han Gi Yong's body.

44:56.940 --> 44:57.940
Are you there?

44:59.979 --> 45:01.010
Ms. Park In Ae.

45:04.050 --> 45:05.449
Are you sure she's here?

45:07.050 --> 45:08.249
We checked\Nthe surveillance camera.

45:08.579 --> 45:09.789
There's a footage of her\Ngoing in, but nothing...

45:09.789 --> 45:10.820
of her coming out.

45:10.820 --> 45:11.849
That means she's inside.

45:14.789 --> 45:17.260
Can we unlock the door?

45:17.960 --> 45:19.490
We can't unlock\Na lady's room.

45:19.960 --> 45:21.329
It could be an emergency.

45:23.030 --> 45:24.070
Gosh.

45:25.269 --> 45:27.869
Only the superintendent\Nhas the key.

45:30.369 --> 45:32.309
Are you the only one\Nwho manages the keys?

45:33.010 --> 45:34.010
Yes.

45:34.479 --> 45:36.349
We manage them strictly...

45:36.349 --> 45:38.050
because there could be\Naccidents among students.

45:38.050 --> 45:39.780
That's why we're strict\Nwith them.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.320
Have you seen Han Gi Yong?

45:41.320 --> 45:42.349
Han Gi Yong?

45:42.349 --> 45:44.090
I asked if you have seen\NHan Gi Yong!

45:44.389 --> 45:45.389
I haven't seen him.

45:45.389 --> 45:47.159
My gosh, where did he go?

45:48.289 --> 45:51.929
By the way, do you\Nmemorize everyone's name?

45:52.360 --> 45:54.260
- What?\N- It seems like...

45:54.260 --> 45:56.059
you know Han Gi Yong well.

45:56.599 --> 45:59.229
He was in trouble before.\NThat's why I remember.

45:59.229 --> 46:00.470
Usually,

46:00.599 --> 46:02.539
people ask "why" first.

46:03.139 --> 46:04.440
It seemed like you knew\Nshe was going to...

46:04.440 --> 46:05.470
look for him.

46:05.710 --> 46:07.110
Goodness, it's because...

46:08.479 --> 46:10.880
You know how those two\Nare related, right?

46:10.880 --> 46:12.749
She's staff,\Nand he's a student.

46:12.749 --> 46:14.220
That's all there is.

46:14.220 --> 46:15.820
You know something,\Ndon't you?

46:15.820 --> 46:16.820
What?

46:16.820 --> 46:18.849
There's a reason\Nwhy she looked for...

46:18.949 --> 46:20.119
Han Gi Yong, right?

46:20.260 --> 46:22.619
It's because of the rumor.

46:22.619 --> 46:23.760
That stalker rumor.

46:23.760 --> 46:25.659
The one about how she'll\Nkill him in a week?

46:25.789 --> 46:28.199
That marked\Nthe seventh day.

46:28.630 --> 46:30.369
The cat that In Ae was\Nraising like a child...

46:30.369 --> 46:31.670
died that day too.

46:31.999 --> 46:34.840
That's why I thought\Nshe was anxious.

46:35.099 --> 46:36.170
A cat?

46:46.320 --> 46:47.949
Park In Ae\Nlooked after the cat...

46:47.949 --> 46:49.519
as though he's her child.

46:56.889 --> 46:58.559
Do you want to drink\Nsome tea with mommy?

46:59.760 --> 47:02.130
She fed him her food.

47:02.900 --> 47:04.130
She let him sleep\Non her bed.

47:04.929 --> 47:06.639
How did you know she\Nlet him sleep on her bed?

47:07.970 --> 47:09.269
Did you peek into\Nher room?

47:09.499 --> 47:12.470
She said it herself.

47:12.470 --> 47:14.240
You heard a lot...

47:14.639 --> 47:15.979
about Park In Ae.

47:15.979 --> 47:17.309
Park In Ae and\NHan Gi Yong.

47:17.309 --> 47:18.510
What was\Ntheir relationship?

47:19.179 --> 47:21.820
Why was Park In Ae\Nlooking for Han Gi Yong?

47:22.019 --> 47:25.550
I knew that\Nthey were going out.

47:35.999 --> 47:37.999
- Have you seen Gi Yong?\N- No, I haven't.

47:41.199 --> 47:42.440
Have you seen Gi Yong?

47:43.369 --> 47:44.369
What?

47:45.840 --> 47:46.880
Well...

47:50.010 --> 47:51.179
Hey, you.

47:56.179 --> 47:58.420
Are you crazy?\NWho are you to hit her?

47:58.420 --> 47:59.920
She flirted with you.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.490
You didn't pick up\Nmy call because of her?

48:01.490 --> 48:02.519
Come with me.

48:02.590 --> 48:03.690
- Stop it.\N- Hey!

48:03.690 --> 48:05.229
Why didn't you stop them?

48:05.429 --> 48:07.499
Dating is not\Nallowed here.

48:08.059 --> 48:10.929
Because my staff member\Nwas involved with this.

48:11.470 --> 48:13.840
I thought it would be bad\Nif people find out.

48:13.840 --> 48:15.800
So you just kicked out\NJoo Yeon who's a student.

48:15.800 --> 48:19.110
Yes. I also didn't know...

48:19.110 --> 48:20.479
she would commit suicide.

48:20.809 --> 48:24.249
It's natural\NPark In Ae was shocked.

48:29.420 --> 48:31.590
They say it's a rumor that\Nshe committed suicide.

48:32.220 --> 48:33.220
What?

48:34.019 --> 48:35.460
I heard that she...

48:35.460 --> 48:36.829
jumped off a cliff.

48:36.829 --> 48:38.130
They couldn't even\Nretrieve her body.

48:38.130 --> 48:40.329
That doesn't mean\Nshe is dead.

48:40.760 --> 48:43.699
By the way, why did you\Nthink that it was a ghost?

48:43.769 --> 48:44.769
That...

48:44.900 --> 48:47.869
is because somebody\Nsaw Joo Yeon.

48:48.099 --> 48:49.340
Who saw her?

48:50.340 --> 48:52.210
I don't know.

48:52.470 --> 48:54.579
Park In Ae believed it\Nthat way.

48:55.110 --> 48:57.179
She believed that somebody\Nsaw Kang Joo Yeon.

48:58.510 --> 48:59.880
Someone saw Kang Joo Yeon.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.619
What are you\Ntalking about?

49:03.249 --> 49:04.389
She committed suicide,\Ndidn't she?

49:08.119 --> 49:09.889
It's okay.

49:09.889 --> 49:12.360
Let's give it some thought\Nfor a minute.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.570
I don't think\Nthey told you directly.

49:19.030 --> 49:22.570
I heard them talk to\Neach other by chance.

49:23.809 --> 49:25.170
Are you a stalker?

49:25.610 --> 49:29.309
Eavesdropping\Nisn't a crime, is it?

49:29.309 --> 49:33.380
So did Kang Joo Yeon\Nshow up for real?

49:34.150 --> 49:36.019
She must've been captured\Non the CCTV footage then.

49:36.050 --> 49:38.119
I searched through\Nevery CCTV footage...

49:38.119 --> 49:40.119
to see if she really\Ncame back.

49:40.320 --> 49:42.460
I couldn't find any trace.

49:42.460 --> 49:43.929
And this isn't a place...

49:43.929 --> 49:45.630
where people can\Neasily come and go.

49:46.300 --> 49:48.559
That's why there was\Na rumor about the ghost.

49:50.269 --> 49:53.499
I guess you use\Nthat key often.

49:54.970 --> 49:56.670
You found that key\Nright away...

49:57.170 --> 49:58.840
among all those keys.

49:58.840 --> 50:01.039
It's a crime to unlock\Nother people's rooms.

50:01.039 --> 50:02.409
It's housebreaking.

50:03.880 --> 50:05.210
There's\Na room number on it.

50:05.449 --> 50:07.479
Stop being\Nso suspicious of me.

50:13.090 --> 50:15.519
- What?\N- Ms. Park In Ae?

50:15.519 --> 50:17.429
- Ms. Park In Ae?\N- Why won't this open?

50:17.590 --> 50:19.530
- Ms. Park In Ae?\N- Use your strength.

50:25.199 --> 50:26.240
She's dead.

50:27.039 --> 50:28.139
What?

50:37.280 --> 50:39.749
It's not me.

50:39.949 --> 50:41.650
I didn't do it.

50:41.650 --> 50:42.920
What didn't you do?

50:43.389 --> 50:46.019
I told you I didn't do it.

50:47.059 --> 50:49.260
It's not me.

51:06.440 --> 51:08.139
It's not me.

51:11.909 --> 51:14.679
I have a feeling that\Nthere's something.

51:15.679 --> 51:16.949
What kind of feeling...

51:17.889 --> 51:19.190
is that?

51:20.460 --> 51:22.159
Don't rely too much\Non my feeling.

51:23.059 --> 51:24.690
It's time you\Ngo independent.

51:25.289 --> 51:26.499
It's making me\Nuncomfortable.

51:26.999 --> 51:29.499
And why did you come all\Nthe way here to see me?

51:31.530 --> 51:33.199
Let's start with\Nthe CCTV footages...

51:33.199 --> 51:34.769
of the day\Nwhen Han Gi Yong died.

51:35.240 --> 51:36.840
Are the police\Non their way?

51:37.210 --> 51:38.510
We couldn't get\Nin touch with the police,

51:38.510 --> 51:39.840
so our employee\Nwent to report himself.

51:40.510 --> 51:42.610
Even cars can't come\Nin here, so how can they?

51:42.880 --> 51:44.650
Will they come by foot?

51:44.650 --> 51:46.920
Yes, due to the rockslide,

51:46.920 --> 51:48.119
the telephone poles\Nfell down,

51:48.119 --> 51:49.280
and we can't\Nuse our phones.

51:50.190 --> 51:51.220
No.

51:52.749 --> 51:53.760
Where are you going?

51:53.760 --> 51:55.590
We need more people to\Ncheck all these footages.

51:56.260 --> 51:57.530
I'll come with you.

52:15.510 --> 52:17.880
I need to study\Nthe criminal law now.

52:20.220 --> 52:21.619
You should go study.

52:21.619 --> 52:23.119
I'll work twice more.

52:23.820 --> 52:24.889
But...

52:25.490 --> 52:26.519
I'm scared.

52:26.519 --> 52:29.960
Then just sit down quietly\Nand look at your monitors.

52:30.389 --> 52:32.329
You went to jail once,\Nso don't act weak.

52:32.329 --> 52:33.900
What? Jail?

52:33.960 --> 52:36.229
Can't you differentiate\Njail from a holding cell?

52:36.670 --> 52:39.030
Why would you bring up\Na bad memory?

52:39.030 --> 52:40.800
She went there because\Nshe was falsely charged.

52:40.800 --> 52:43.070
I know you and your friend\Ntake upskirt pictures.

52:43.070 --> 52:46.010
That's not true. We're\Nfilming a documentary.

52:46.010 --> 52:48.179
Taking pictures of women's\Nlegs isn't a documentary.

52:48.179 --> 52:49.240
Shut it!

52:49.909 --> 52:51.710
All of you are\Non the list of suspects.

52:51.710 --> 52:52.849
- Me?\N- Again?

52:52.849 --> 52:54.920
I'm on the list too.

52:55.050 --> 52:58.190
So let's catch\Nthe culprit quickly.

52:59.920 --> 53:02.690
Keep the order\Nand come in.

53:02.690 --> 53:03.729
Come in.

53:04.559 --> 53:06.229
- Hurry.\N- Come in.

53:06.229 --> 53:07.559
Hurry up and come in.

53:09.460 --> 53:10.999
They're all our students.

53:10.999 --> 53:13.269
We're done counting\Nall our students.

53:13.470 --> 53:15.900
To prevent from\Nhaving another victim,

53:16.199 --> 53:18.240
I asked them to gather\Nyou all in here.

53:18.240 --> 53:21.510
For the sake of your\Nsafety, you'll move...

53:21.710 --> 53:24.449
in groups of five under\Nthe staff's instruction.

53:25.050 --> 53:27.220
Please cooperate\Nuntil the police arrive,

53:27.220 --> 53:28.220
okay?

53:28.220 --> 53:29.550
- Okay.\N- Okay.

53:30.889 --> 53:33.059
About the CCTVs...

53:33.059 --> 53:35.389
Sit down and stay quiet.

53:35.920 --> 53:39.059
That man\Nis so charismatic.

53:39.630 --> 53:40.699
Really?

53:41.260 --> 53:43.499
His nickname is Sniffer.

53:44.769 --> 53:46.199
He appeared\Nin a commercial...

53:46.199 --> 53:47.570
as a handsome\Ndetective too.

53:48.039 --> 53:50.110
I see. No wonder.

53:50.940 --> 53:52.139
Is he that cool?

53:52.139 --> 53:53.840
He's still an old man.

53:53.840 --> 53:54.880
Hey.

53:55.479 --> 53:57.579
Detectives can't be\Nmore handsome than him.

53:57.809 --> 53:59.309
Detective Ha...

53:59.309 --> 54:00.949
is as handsome\Nas celebrities.

54:00.949 --> 54:03.449
His sharp nose and stuff.\NAm I right?

54:04.320 --> 54:06.260
- Hey.\N- Don't ask me to answer.

54:06.820 --> 54:08.659
We can't catch the culprit\Nif you act like that.

54:08.860 --> 54:10.690
Check the CCTV footages.

54:21.199 --> 54:22.570
This is strange.

54:22.570 --> 54:23.639
What is?

54:27.210 --> 54:28.510
It's about\Nthe superintendent.

54:29.479 --> 54:32.210
He seems to pass by here\Nwithout any reason.

54:32.409 --> 54:33.479
The superintendent?

54:36.420 --> 54:37.490
Oh, the cigarette.

54:38.449 --> 54:39.860
Do you know something?

54:40.159 --> 54:42.260
I was filming a while ago.

54:43.289 --> 54:45.460
Were you filming with\Nthat hidden camera again?

54:46.729 --> 54:48.499
I saw the scene myself.

54:49.400 --> 54:50.599
So did this.

54:54.769 --> 54:56.369
Will we have a day when we\Ncan catch the culprit...

54:56.369 --> 54:57.639
with the hidden camera?

54:57.639 --> 54:58.710
Let's check it out.

55:12.220 --> 55:15.019
Only Han Gi Yong smokes\NPeace cigarettes.

55:19.329 --> 55:20.360
Where are you going?

55:31.970 --> 55:33.880
If the culprit\Nwasn't hiding...

55:33.909 --> 55:35.909
There's no place\Nto hide in this tiny room.

55:36.849 --> 55:39.949
Illegal immigrants\Nhide on top of a car...

55:39.949 --> 55:42.550
or a remodeled fuel tank\Nfor days.

55:43.320 --> 55:45.820
2 people to 4 people...

55:46.659 --> 55:47.659
can hide there.

55:47.659 --> 55:50.360
There's no trace of anyone\Ngoing out of this room.

55:50.360 --> 55:51.789
That's why we searched\Nthrough everything.

55:51.860 --> 55:53.159
Still, we found nothing.

55:53.860 --> 55:55.429
Then it means...

55:56.369 --> 55:57.369
Are you getting a feeling?

55:58.530 --> 55:59.999
It's a locked-room\Nmurder case.

56:00.869 --> 56:02.699
You're talking about\Nsomething obvious again.

56:05.470 --> 56:06.679
What can be\Nthe cause of her death?

56:06.679 --> 56:08.909
There's no trace of\Nthrottling her with wire.

56:08.909 --> 56:11.010
Did the culprit block her\Nairway by any chance?

56:11.010 --> 56:12.280
She could've\Ndied of shock...

56:12.280 --> 56:13.579
from acute\Nallergic reaction.

56:13.579 --> 56:16.179
Or the culprit might've\Ninjected something,

56:16.179 --> 56:18.019
using a needle.

56:18.590 --> 56:19.619
Injection?

56:25.289 --> 56:26.960
There's no trace\Nof injection.

56:38.340 --> 56:40.340
Why don't we go out\Nand take some fresh air?

56:41.179 --> 56:42.179
Sure.

56:42.240 --> 56:43.849
Let's do that.

56:44.380 --> 56:46.420
I watched the footages\Nof the same door all day.

56:46.420 --> 56:48.920
I'm confused if I'm the\Ndoor or the door is me.

56:51.190 --> 56:52.420
Why are you coming along?

56:53.690 --> 56:55.360
We have to move\Nin groups of five.

56:56.119 --> 56:58.059
You'll go out too, right?

56:58.329 --> 57:00.429
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

57:00.499 --> 57:01.829
There are five of us.

57:09.240 --> 57:10.670
We'll step outside\Nfor a minute.

57:12.840 --> 57:14.740
We made a group of five.

57:15.780 --> 57:16.979
Goodness.

57:18.650 --> 57:19.679
Excuse me.

57:21.420 --> 57:23.420
Sir, we're going to...

57:41.039 --> 57:42.269
It's the student hall.

57:48.380 --> 57:49.909
What's going on?

58:00.289 --> 58:01.389
He's dead.

58:19.470 --> 58:20.740
It's a serial murder.

58:21.440 --> 58:23.280
How did the culprit\Nmanage to kill him...

58:23.579 --> 58:24.809
when there were\Nso many people?

58:28.079 --> 58:29.820
There's no such thing\Nas locked-room murders.

58:31.119 --> 58:32.990
- What?\N- They're only tricks.

58:33.960 --> 58:36.119
The room would be sealed\Neither after the murder...

58:36.260 --> 58:37.889
or after the set-up...

58:38.789 --> 58:40.329
for the murder.

58:44.300 --> 58:46.130
So how did the culprit\Nkill the victims?

58:47.999 --> 58:49.139
The culprit is...

58:59.210 --> 59:01.979
(1. Kang Joo Yeon, student\Nof Cheongryul Institution)

59:11.429 --> 59:14.960
(Suspect 1. Kang Joo Yeon,\N2. Kim Yeong Seon)

59:14.960 --> 59:18.400
(3. Park In Ae,\N4. Oh Seong Tae)
