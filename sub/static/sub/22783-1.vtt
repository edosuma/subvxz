00:01.902 --> 00:05.137
LEMONIS: Tonight, on a special
episode of "The Profit"...

00:05.139 --> 00:06.305
Who's fired up?

00:06.307 --> 00:09.375
After 70 episodes of
investing my own money

00:09.377 --> 00:10.776
in small businesses,

00:10.778 --> 00:12.811
I'm opening my books...

00:12.813 --> 00:14.813
I've never seen a check
that big before.

00:14.815 --> 00:15.981
LEMONIS:
...revealing what happened

00:15.983 --> 00:17.916
after the cameras
stopped rolling.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.485
I asked for one thing!

00:19.487 --> 00:21.620
Which deals paid off big time...

00:21.622 --> 00:23.455
I'm blown away.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.657
...and which cost me millions?

00:25.659 --> 00:26.992
I would run.

00:26.994 --> 00:29.895
From the phonies and the frauds
I never saw coming...

00:29.897 --> 00:31.663
You know, I don't want
to be sitting here just...

00:31.665 --> 00:32.931
Working?

00:32.933 --> 00:35.134
...to the incredible success
stories that changed

00:35.136 --> 00:37.603
my life and business forever.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.238
Thank you so much.
Yeah.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.206
This is "The Profit,"

00:41.208 --> 00:42.541
my biggest wins

00:42.543 --> 00:45.310
and most heartbreaking losses.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.146
My name is Marcus Lemonis,

00:47.148 --> 00:50.983
and I risk my own money
to save struggling businesses.

00:50.985 --> 00:52.451
We're not going to wake up
every morning

00:52.453 --> 00:53.819
wondering if we have a job.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.320
We're going to wake up
every morning

00:55.322 --> 00:57.189
wondering how many jobs
we have to do.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.024
It's not always pretty.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.859
Everything's going to change.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.194
Everything.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.531
But I do it to save jobs,
and I do it to make money.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.032
This...
Let go to work.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.367
...is "The Profit."

01:08.369 --> 01:14.573
♪♪

01:14.575 --> 01:16.475
It's hard to believe
that I've been doing

01:16.477 --> 01:17.976
"The Profit"
for several years now.

01:17.978 --> 01:21.547
And I've done a lot of deals
with a ton of businesses.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.948
We have a deal?
We got a deal.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.149
Partner?

01:24.151 --> 01:25.651
I think most people are
under the impression

01:25.653 --> 01:27.553
that if the deal ends well,

01:27.555 --> 01:29.621
then it's, like,
"Millions for everybody!

01:29.623 --> 01:30.756
And it's going to be great."

01:30.758 --> 01:32.091
Wow.
Congratulations, guys.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.692
Thanks again.
Get your ass to work.

01:33.694 --> 01:34.960
It just wasn't true.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.862
I'm not sure
who to be pissed at...

01:36.864 --> 01:39.298
myself for doing the deal,

01:39.300 --> 01:41.934
or you guys for letting
this stuff just sit here.

01:41.936 --> 01:44.603
In order to understand
how I look at wins and losses,

01:44.605 --> 01:48.240
I have to probably define
for you how I look at them.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.775
A "win" isn't always
about money.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.610
It can be somebody's
personal development,

01:51.612 --> 01:53.112
it can be fulfillment.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.681
But it's mostly about
the money.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.951
In the case of the "losses,"
it's about losing money, right?

01:58.953 --> 02:02.187
But, it's also about things that
sometimes just piss me off.

02:02.189 --> 02:05.524
So, in the case of
Patrick DiLascia, I lost money

02:05.526 --> 02:07.159
<i>and</i> he pissed me off.

02:07.161 --> 02:11.730
Which is why DiLascia definitely
falls in the "loss" category.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.732
DiLascia made graphic tees.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.001
LEMONIS:
I've seen it at Barney's.
I've seen it at Nordstrom.

02:16.003 --> 02:18.570
It's everywhere.
This is kind of what made
our brand super-famous.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.373
I literally drew it on, like,
a piece of paper.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.841
And, like, we have to make
the plane look backwards

02:22.843 --> 02:24.743
and do everything in reverse.
That is very cool.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.578
Patrick DiLascia
owned the business,

02:26.580 --> 02:29.681
with the help of his two
siblings, Kelly and Dan.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.750
Though they had
some minor success

02:31.752 --> 02:33.352
with really big retailers,

02:33.354 --> 02:35.420
they really had no process
or strategy

02:35.422 --> 02:37.589
and were struggling
to stay afloat.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.958
He's the little brother.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.827
We're always trying
to take care of him.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.130
Why do you help so much?

02:45.132 --> 02:50.068
I don't know.
Just something I've always done.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.904
Why?

02:51.906 --> 02:55.007
'Cause my mom would have
taken care of him.

02:55.009 --> 02:58.410
She's not here.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.945
Patrick,
you're a lucky guy.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.880
I know I'm lucky.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.415
But I would do anything
for them, too.

03:03.417 --> 03:08.954
My initial deal was to infuse
$200,000 into the business

03:08.956 --> 03:10.522
to clear some
of the payables

03:10.524 --> 03:14.059
and to reinvest that money
into a broader inventory.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.328
I like this as
a lightweight hoodie.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.197
So it's like a T-shirt.
Yeah.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.432
LEMONIS: But, throughout
the episode,

03:20.434 --> 03:22.668
I'm really struggling
with Patrick's willingness

03:22.670 --> 03:24.369
to change...
willingness to listen.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.470
How much would
this retail for?

03:25.472 --> 03:26.939
What would
you pay for it?

03:26.941 --> 03:28.207
$75?

03:28.209 --> 03:30.876
I can't believe
you said $75 for that!

03:30.878 --> 03:32.578
We're not at Forever 21
anymore.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.047
And there's one
particular moment

03:35.049 --> 03:36.381
that I never revealed.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.284
I have an artist friend
named Rolland Berry.

03:39.286 --> 03:42.354
And one day Rolland called me,
and Rolland said,

03:42.356 --> 03:45.190
"There's a history
between Patrick and I.

03:45.192 --> 03:49.428
I actually am the one
who started the business.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.129
I'm telling you
this as your friend.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.164
Walk away now."

03:52.166 --> 03:53.632
I was shocked to hear this.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.834
So I brought Patrick
to Rolland's warehouse.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.503
Through my experience
with him,

03:58.505 --> 04:02.407
I've felt like I didn't
always get the whole story.

04:02.409 --> 04:06.044
And then, also, I wasn't
comfortable with the flow in,

04:06.046 --> 04:08.313
flow out of money
and how that worked.

04:08.315 --> 04:10.115
I personally wouldn't do
business with him again...

04:10.117 --> 04:11.617
personally, I wouldn't.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.719
I think what pissed me off
most about it is,

04:13.721 --> 04:16.454
I understand that people have
business dealings in the past

04:16.457 --> 04:17.889
that don't work out.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.958
But, why wouldn't you tell me
about those things?

04:19.959 --> 04:23.095
The fact that Rolland
was never mentioned, ever,

04:23.097 --> 04:26.398
seems like a really calculated
omission from Patrick.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.302
You never thought to say
anything about other people,

04:30.304 --> 04:32.337
other businesses,
not even for a second?

04:32.339 --> 04:33.338
No, honestly,
not really.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.606
Okay.
I mean...

04:34.608 --> 04:36.775
Then that lets me know
what your logic is like.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.143
Right, I mean...
And so I'm telling you,

04:38.145 --> 04:40.379
that logic
doesn't work for me.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.181
So, that was one bad thing...
one red flag.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.484
But then I found out
Patrick wasn't honest

04:45.486 --> 04:47.386
and he wasn't transparent
about things,

04:47.388 --> 04:49.721
especially when
it came to money.

04:49.723 --> 04:54.126
I ended up being personally sued
by one of his vendors

04:54.128 --> 04:56.962
that he did not
tell me about.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.531
I had to write
a $36,000 check.

04:59.533 --> 05:03.268
So now I have
$236,000 invested.

05:03.270 --> 05:07.172
In the end, I said I just can't
get taken advantage of anymore.

05:07.174 --> 05:10.676
So Patrick is no longer
associated with DiLascia.

05:10.678 --> 05:13.745
The money that I've invested,
I had to take it as a write-off,

05:13.747 --> 05:16.581
and...

05:16.583 --> 05:17.649
it's gone.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.985
It was a really terrible
experience for me,

05:19.987 --> 05:23.188
one of the worst that I've had
in the history of this show.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.524
And he didn't even have
the courtesy to apologize.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.758
Oh, my God, you guys!

05:26.760 --> 05:28.794
Unfortunately,
that's not the only time

05:28.796 --> 05:31.263
that I made a mistake
and misjudged somebody.

05:31.265 --> 05:34.533
Another disaster for me...
Blues Jean Bar.

05:34.535 --> 05:38.036
The Blues Jean Bar was
a retail chain of fashion stores

05:38.038 --> 05:40.539
that predominantly sold denim,

05:40.541 --> 05:42.407
and it was owned
by Lady Fuller.

05:42.409 --> 05:43.508
I'm Lady.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.743
I'm Marcus, how are you?
Nice to meet you.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.311
Lady had started
the business with her

05:46.313 --> 05:48.380
deceased mother's inheritance.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.583
And she was determined to create
a cool shopping atmosphere

05:51.585 --> 05:52.918
to honor her memory.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.655
You know, my mother passed away
when I was nine,

05:56.657 --> 05:58.990
and she took her own life.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.992
She left me money

06:00.994 --> 06:02.761
and I wanted to do something
with her money

06:02.763 --> 06:04.896
that paid homage to her.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.998
And I think on some much
deeper level,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.768
prove to myself that my life

06:09.770 --> 06:11.436
was going to be different
than hers.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.705
While her original intentions
were right,

06:13.707 --> 06:16.041
she definitely got lost
along the way.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.242
At its height,

06:17.244 --> 06:20.245
the Blues Jean Bar
had 13 locations.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.481
When I walked in,
it had three.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.183
I walked into a
very pleasant staff,

06:25.185 --> 06:27.052
but a very confusing
business model.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.654
All right, the basic premise
of the store is that you can't,

06:29.656 --> 06:31.556
you know, touch the jeans
without us.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.191
Do they actually say
to people,

06:33.193 --> 06:35.293
"You can't touch the jeans
without us"?

06:35.295 --> 06:36.461
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.764
They can't walk
behind the bar.
Okay.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.432
The deal that
I made with Lady was

06:40.434 --> 06:43.268
that I would put $900,000
in the business

06:43.270 --> 06:44.803
for 50% of the business.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.305
...to you, the both of us!
And don't forget,
I'm 100% in charge.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.573
I know you are.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.509
And I wanted to really
renovate the concept

06:50.511 --> 06:52.043
and start over.

06:52.045 --> 06:55.247
What I'm looking to do
is change the entire store.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.415
LADY: Can we step back
for a second?

06:56.417 --> 06:59.084
And can I ask you,
if we take the bar out,

06:59.086 --> 07:02.387
then we're just Gap
on steroids?

07:02.389 --> 07:03.789
We're just a white box.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.191
And I feel like the reason
why this store is so cool

07:06.193 --> 07:07.559
is because we have the bar.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.628
But it didn't work
for this business.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.964
You opened up 13 of them,
and they didn't work.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.367
Through the process,
I had to really work through

07:15.369 --> 07:17.402
poor inventory choices.

07:17.404 --> 07:19.805
This is basically a room
full of mistakes

07:19.807 --> 07:21.873
and desperate buying
without a plan.

07:21.875 --> 07:25.811
And more importantly,
an owner who was really

07:25.813 --> 07:27.446
never visiting the stores.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.581
I haven't seen Lady
in six years.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.916
I've never met Lady.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.452
In the end, I ended up
changing the entire concept...

07:33.454 --> 07:35.887
the shopping experience,
the look, the feel,

07:35.889 --> 07:38.957
and I even changed the name
to Denim & Soul.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.759
Well, you didn't take the soul
out of the business.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.295
We unveil it, Lady's happy,
everybody's hugging,

07:43.297 --> 07:44.963
it's super-emotional.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.165
Oh, my God!

07:47.167 --> 07:48.366
Oh, my God!

07:48.368 --> 07:51.069
It doesn't even look
like the same store.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.405
Everybody's excited
about the relationship.

07:53.407 --> 07:57.809
If you haven't met Marcus,
which many of you have,

07:57.811 --> 08:02.113
major thank you to him
because without him, you know,

08:02.115 --> 08:05.517
a lot of people's dreams,
not just mine,

08:05.519 --> 08:07.018
wouldn't come true.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.053
And, so thank you.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.555
And, so this is really
where things

08:10.557 --> 08:11.857
started to get weird.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.459
Little by little, we started
to uncover these things.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.428
What I ended up finding out

08:16.430 --> 08:19.364
is that a number of the vendors
she had on her books,

08:19.366 --> 08:20.532
she never paid them.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.567
None of that was disclosed.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.102
And what happened
was I went back

08:24.104 --> 08:25.737
to a number of these vendors

08:25.739 --> 08:27.772
and said, "Hey, I'd like to grow
my business with you."

08:27.774 --> 08:29.274
And their comment
back to me was

08:29.276 --> 08:31.643
"Yeah, we'd like to grow
our business with you, too,

08:31.645 --> 08:34.578
but we're not crazy about
Lady Fuller being involved

08:34.581 --> 08:37.381
because her business
still owes us money."

08:37.384 --> 08:41.219
For a brief minute, I had
other vendors questioning me

08:41.221 --> 08:43.455
and my integrity was at risk.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.524
And I had to work hard
to clean that up.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.260
So, after the issues
with the vendors,

08:48.262 --> 08:51.229
I decided that it was best
for Lady and I to part ways.

08:51.231 --> 08:54.533
I ended up signing a note
with Lady Fuller

08:54.535 --> 08:58.270
to buy her interests
for $500,000.

08:58.272 --> 09:04.776
So I invested about $900,000
to acquire three denim stores,

09:04.778 --> 09:09.381
then I invested another $500,000
to buy Lady Fuller out.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.117
And throughout the process,

09:12.119 --> 09:15.820
I had to eat different bills
that uncovered themselves.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.990
So I have probably
almost $2 million invested

09:18.992 --> 09:20.659
in what I bought from Lady,

09:20.661 --> 09:22.127
which was three stores.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.530
The reason that's a big deal for
me is that Denim & Soul today

09:25.532 --> 09:30.268
is one of my most successful
retail businesses that I have.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.504
It does unbelievably well.

09:32.506 --> 09:33.772
It's awesome!

09:33.774 --> 09:36.007
I think one of the reasons
that I categorize this

09:36.009 --> 09:39.511
as one of my biggest losses is,
in the end, I realized

09:39.513 --> 09:43.014
that I didn't even need to do
business with Lady Fuller

09:43.016 --> 09:44.816
to open these stores

09:44.818 --> 09:46.818
and then feel
taken advantage of.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.453

09:50.991 --> 09:52.958
But I don't want anybody
to feel bad for me

09:52.960 --> 09:55.460
because my entrance
into the fashion business

09:55.462 --> 09:58.330
has turned out to be
wildly successful.

09:58.332 --> 10:00.732
And that brings me
to one of my biggest wins

10:00.734 --> 10:02.167
in "Profit" history...

10:02.169 --> 10:04.536
COURAGE b.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.404
It was a chain of retail stores

10:06.406 --> 10:08.873
that predominantly dealt
with women's fashion.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.942
Look, all the detail inside!

10:10.944 --> 10:12.911
LEMONIS:
Noemi was the chief designer

10:12.913 --> 10:15.547
and her kids, Stephanie and
Nicolas, ran the business.

10:15.549 --> 10:17.115
Did you make the labels
for these yet?

10:17.117 --> 10:20.018
They did about $5 million
or $6 million in sales,

10:20.020 --> 10:21.519
but they still
were losing money.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.356
Who designed, like,
these two things right here?

10:24.358 --> 10:25.757
STEPHANIE: Noemi did.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.093
Well, we probably could pick
a hundred things like that.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.294
And then produce...
Liquidate that.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.528
It doesn't matter
if it liquidate...

10:30.530 --> 10:32.464
don't try and justify it.
It wasn't correct.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.266
Nicolas was a hothead.

10:35.268 --> 10:39.170
You want all of the accolade
without doing any of the work.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.406
And Stephanie...
it was interesting...

10:41.408 --> 10:43.708
maybe the smartest one
of the three of them,

10:43.710 --> 10:45.176
but she always took
a back seat.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.778
You're not liable.

10:46.780 --> 10:47.912
So there's absolutely...
STEPHANIE: Stop.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.114
LEMONIS: There were
a lot of issues

10:49.116 --> 10:50.315
and a lot of personalities

10:50.317 --> 10:52.217
and a lot of things to fix.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.219
But there was way more to like.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.821
My initial investment
was $800,000

10:56.823 --> 10:58.957
for 30% of the business.

10:58.959 --> 11:02.460
In the first year, it was really
about changing the product,

11:02.462 --> 11:04.729
renovating the stores,

11:04.731 --> 11:07.432
and understanding how
the family dynamics would work.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.501
You guys are a dangerous trio.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.469
I'm just trying to keep up
with you guys.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.505
And right out of the gates,
it was going pretty well.

11:13.507 --> 11:17.442
I think you've grown amazingly
in the last eight months.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.077
And I have to give you
a lot of credit.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.945
But, as I dug
into the business,

11:20.947 --> 11:24.182
I essentially realized that the
real asset in that deal

11:24.184 --> 11:25.517
was the people.

11:25.519 --> 11:28.453
Nicolas ended up really
becoming a trusted partner,

11:28.455 --> 11:30.755
and he's grown a lot
as an individual.

11:32.926 --> 11:37.162
And Stephanie... she's blossomed
like no other person I've seen.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.497
There you go,
enjoy everything.
Thank you.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.100

have transformed.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.869
COURAGE b doesn't exist
anymore in name.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.839
I converted all five stores
into other brands.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.508
What does exist is a fashion
holding company

11:50.510 --> 11:52.210
called ML Fashion,

11:52.212 --> 11:55.580
which consists of all the other
fashion brands I've invested in

11:55.582 --> 11:57.015
throughout "The Profit,"

11:57.017 --> 12:01.286
like Susana Monaco, Siloett,
Flex watches, Inkkas.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.756
We have seven brands
and 29 stores.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.191
Most have done pretty well.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.993

12:08.995 --> 12:11.796
But overall, business
is doing fantastic.

12:11.798 --> 12:14.365
And you know who runs it?
Stephanie.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.234
I'm proud of you.
Thank you.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.904
And Nicolas is actually now
helping run Gander Outdoors,

12:19.906 --> 12:21.940
which is a business
I acquired out of bankruptcy.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.109
And he still has equity
in ML Fashion.

12:24.111 --> 12:27.212
What's ironic about all of this
is that what started out

12:27.214 --> 12:29.581
as an $800,000 investment

12:29.583 --> 12:32.617
in five women's fashion stores,

12:32.619 --> 12:35.687
has turned into
an $18 million venture

12:35.689 --> 12:37.522
into the fashion business.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.390
And I'm not going to stop
anytime soon.

12:41.228 --> 12:44.395
...the true definition
of a raw deal.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.799
Perfect flavor.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.502
One of my most
promising investments ends

12:50.504 --> 12:54.239
with a major beef
nobody saw coming.

my biggest win of all.

the original episodes...

13:08.155 --> 13:09.754
I mean I hate to admit it,

13:09.756 --> 13:11.790
but in every case
where a deal went bad,

13:11.792 --> 13:14.592
I ultimately have to
look back at myself.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.561
Did I pick the wrong partners?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.530
Did I enable them too much?

13:18.532 --> 13:23.268
Did I make a business
calculation that was just wrong?

13:23.270 --> 13:25.937
I mean, I really feel like
I have to own all of them.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.439
Are there people that took
advantage of me and screwed me?

13:28.441 --> 13:29.908
You bet.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.876
But did I let them?

13:31.878 --> 13:33.211
Yeah, I did.

examples of that...

in the "loss" category.

I would have started

13:44.324 --> 13:47.325
my infomercial
for Brooklyn Burger.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.626
I would have started
by telling you

13:48.628 --> 13:50.094
about the weight of the burgers

13:50.096 --> 13:53.398
and the quality of the beef,
this beautiful Brooklyn Bridge.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.167
Problem is,
this isn't my business.

13:56.169 --> 14:01.172

but it's not.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.475

to this "business" in Brooklyn

14:04.477 --> 14:05.743
called Stein Meats.

14:05.745 --> 14:06.845
Wow.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.314
A legendary meat house
in New York,

14:09.316 --> 14:14.085
they would supply people like
Peter Lugers and Wolfgang's...

14:14.087 --> 14:16.421
some of the best steakhouses
in America.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.957
Walk me through the process
of how it works.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.091
HOWARD: This is
the receiving area.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.459
We get all out fresh meat
through here.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.761
Owners Alan Buxbaum
and Howard Mora

14:23.763 --> 14:25.396
had taken over "A. Stein"

14:25.398 --> 14:27.765
from their fathers
who founded the company.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.934
And their hamburger,
the Brooklyn Burger,

14:29.936 --> 14:33.605
was the staple at New York's
three biggest sporting venues.

14:33.607 --> 14:34.739
Good burger.
It's the best.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.141
It was a $50 million business,

14:37.143 --> 14:39.210
but something
didn't smell right.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.145
So the money that
the customers owe us...

14:41.147 --> 14:42.814
those are the receivables.
Correct.

14:42.816 --> 14:45.950
How much is our total
receivables right now?

14:45.952 --> 14:48.186
Couple hundred thousand?

14:48.188 --> 14:49.921
Almost $4 million
on the street.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.289
Are you kidding me?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.791
So, based on that information,
the offer I made

14:53.793 --> 14:57.462
was to put $1 million in
and own 50% of the business.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.297
And the way I arrived
at the $1 million offer

14:59.299 --> 15:02.433
was the receivables
and liabilities...

15:02.435 --> 15:06.104
the assets and the liabilities
were off by about $1 million.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.072
And that my million dollars
would essentially

15:08.074 --> 15:09.507
fill that hole,

15:09.509 --> 15:12.911
I would tighten the expenses,
keep the revenue going,

15:12.913 --> 15:15.213
and over time
for a million bucks,

15:15.215 --> 15:17.315
I would own
a $50 million business.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.183
Seemed like a good idea, right?

15:19.185 --> 15:21.386
About 3/4 of the way
through the episode,

15:21.388 --> 15:25.757
I brought in an accountant
to really dig into the numbers.

15:25.759 --> 15:29.160

you're paying in payroll?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.228
No.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.497
Does it interface
into your system?

15:32.499 --> 15:33.598
No.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.633
Do you have an aging
of your payrolls?

15:35.635 --> 15:36.668
No.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.102
And in the end, what I learned

15:38.104 --> 15:41.906
is that it was a much worse
picture than they had painted.

15:41.908 --> 15:46.945

$3.8 million.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.869
I'm starting to make plans
for Brooklyn Burger.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.939
They said to me, "We've decided
we're not going to transfer you

17:54.941 --> 17:56.240
the intellectual property.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.943
We've thought about it after,
and we feel like

17:58.945 --> 18:00.445
we were under pressure.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.813
We're not giving it to you."

18:01.815 --> 18:03.915
I said, "Okay, well, then,
you at least need to give me

18:03.917 --> 18:05.883
my $200,000 back,

18:05.885 --> 18:07.618
and the interest
associated with it."

18:07.620 --> 18:09.987
"We don't have the money."
I was, like,

18:09.989 --> 18:13.825
"Okay... you don't
have the money

18:13.827 --> 18:16.094
and you don't want to
give me the brand.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.196
No problem.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.730
I'm going to sue you."

18:19.732 --> 18:23.334
And so I filed suit,
and the judge said,

18:23.336 --> 18:27.371
"Sorry, do you have
any paperwork to prove it?"

18:27.373 --> 18:29.740
I said, "Well, I have
the footage from the show."

18:29.742 --> 18:32.810
His comment was, "It's on
a reality television show.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.813
I don't know what's real
and what's not."

18:35.815 --> 18:39.951
So, today,
I now sit here $200,000

18:39.953 --> 18:41.919
plus $150,000 in legal fees...

18:41.921 --> 18:43.955
$350,000 out.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.257
And the Brooklyn Burger
happens to be sold

18:46.259 --> 18:48.159
in grocery stores
around the country.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.828
That's a problem, right?

18:50.830 --> 18:53.798
The reason that I put this
in one of my biggest losses

18:53.800 --> 18:55.600
isn't because
of the dollar amount,

18:55.602 --> 18:57.468
it's the lost opportunity.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.005
If Brooklyn Burger is sold in
Wal-Mart, Publix, Kroger,

19:01.007 --> 19:06.310
Target, I mean, could it be
a $20 million business?

19:06.312 --> 19:07.345
Yeah.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.013
And that's what
I was banking on.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.782
That's why I put it in
as one of my biggest losses.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.621
Perfect flavor.

19:16.623 --> 19:19.724
Another business where people
really disappointed me

19:19.726 --> 19:22.193
was Coopersburg Sports.

19:22.195 --> 19:26.731
Coopersburg was a home-grown,
Pennsylvania small company

19:26.733 --> 19:29.500
that really focused
on the licensing

19:29.502 --> 19:31.569
of major-league baseball marks

19:31.571 --> 19:35.039
onto products that would be sold
through sporting-goods stores

19:35.041 --> 19:36.440
and the stadiums themselves.

19:36.442 --> 19:39.177
This is a 18-inch miniature bat
with a full-color,

19:39.179 --> 19:41.245
heat-transfer logo
going to the Mariners.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.648
And what I liked about it

19:43.650 --> 19:45.550
was that it was truly
a family business.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.051
This is my daughter,
Jackie.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.586
I'll call you back. Hi!
That's my wife, Wendy.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.854
That's Benjamin
back there.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.656
How you doing?
I'm Marcus.
Nice to meet you.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.959
I think the challenge
that existed at Coopersburg

19:54.961 --> 19:56.060
was over time,

19:56.062 --> 19:58.996
larger competitors
had come into the space.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.232
And, obviously, what that meant
was their revenue

20:01.234 --> 20:02.433
started to dwindle

20:02.435 --> 20:03.734
and so did their morale.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.369
I never wanted to quit
or give up anything,

20:05.371 --> 20:08.406
and I really feel like this
is one of the toughest things

20:08.408 --> 20:10.374
I've ever gone
through in my life.

20:10.376 --> 20:14.545
Scott appeared to be someone
who was very earnest.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.546
Lot of stress.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.449
I'm tired of it.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.052
A good family man,
great salesman,

20:21.054 --> 20:23.154
great pitchman...

20:23.156 --> 20:24.855
at least I thought he was.

20:24.857 --> 20:29.327
So I agreed to put in $630,000
for 30% of the business.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.295
Started paying off
some of the debt.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.497
Started building new inventory.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.700
Went out and rented
a new warehouse.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.402
It's amazing, isn't it?

20:38.404 --> 20:40.104
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna turn out nice.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.305
Unfortunately, what happened

20:41.307 --> 20:43.407
after the cameras
stopped rolling

20:43.409 --> 20:46.444
is that Scott just continually
called me for more money.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.912
"We need more inventory."

20:47.914 --> 20:48.980
Sent him money.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.082
"We want to try these
new products."

20:51.084 --> 20:52.650
More inventory.

20:52.652 --> 20:56.587
It was almost like the rope
that pulled me in.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.723
And then nothing would develop.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.359
Every time that phone call
comes, right, it's,

21:01.361 --> 21:02.994
"We got to get an order out.

21:02.996 --> 21:05.363
This is burning down.
That's burning down."

21:05.365 --> 21:09.433
But I'm not sure where
the end of the hole is.

21:09.435 --> 21:13.137
So, a year into it,
I have $1.4 million invested.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.572
The calculator told me

21:14.574 --> 21:15.973
that I couldn't
just keep spending money.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.608
I needed to take my losses
and cut them,

21:17.610 --> 21:20.177
and I had a couple choices
to make...

21:20.179 --> 21:23.848
sell my interest
or foreclose as the lender.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.416
This is a big dilemma for me.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.318
And Scott knew that,

21:27.320 --> 21:30.921
and he used it against me
'cause he would say to me,

21:30.923 --> 21:34.025
"People won't like the fact
that you foreclosed on us."

21:34.027 --> 21:35.726
It's almost like
emotional blackmail.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.595
Like, if you don't do this,

21:37.597 --> 21:39.497
the world's going to know
this deal went bad.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.999
It's, like,
"Okay, the deal went bad.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.869
I have no problem admitting
when I screw up... none.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.570
And I won't get embarrassed."

21:46.572 --> 21:48.572
I know you about want
to shoot me right now.

21:48.574 --> 21:50.775
I do kind of want
to shoot you.

21:50.777 --> 21:54.612
I do, because I feel like
it just never ends.

21:54.614 --> 21:58.516
But in the end, was I really
willing to foreclose?

21:58.518 --> 21:59.817
I wasn't.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.754
And I ended up probably being
softer in that situation

22:03.756 --> 22:07.992
because I didn't like
what it was bringing out in me.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.760
Holy [BLEEP], Scott.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.262
I feel like
you're hustling me.

22:11.264 --> 22:15.499
And so I sold all of
my shares back to them

22:15.501 --> 22:17.768
for $80,000 in product.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.770
They're still open today.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.405
I'm happy they're still open.

22:21.407 --> 22:24.075
I'm happy their family's
all working together.

22:24.077 --> 22:28.346
I'm not happy about the fact
that I lost $1.4 million,

22:28.348 --> 22:31.882
and I have $80,000 worth of crap
sitting in a warehouse.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.017
But here's the thing.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.419
They think some people
would have changed

22:35.421 --> 22:36.954
their business practice

22:36.956 --> 22:39.690
or stopped doing
deals on handshakes

22:39.692 --> 22:41.492
or stop trusting people.

22:41.494 --> 22:44.228
But that's part of
my secret sauce.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.831
Yeah, I know that people
take advantage of me.

22:46.833 --> 22:50.101
But my single biggest lesson is
I'm not going to change who I am

22:50.103 --> 22:54.638
or the way I do it because in
the overall picture, it works.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.840
It really has for me.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.129
Over the years,

23:18.131 --> 23:20.297
nearly $60 million

23:20.299 --> 23:22.199
in all kinds of businesses.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.602
I think the biggest
misconception

23:24.604 --> 23:26.570
that some of these
business owners have

23:26.572 --> 23:28.773
that continues to frustrate me

23:28.775 --> 23:32.309
is that people expect me
to do the work.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.611
You don't look like you
want to get in there.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.879

WOMAN: Okay.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.649
You got to get down...

23:38.651 --> 23:40.985
I think in some of the ones
that have really worked,

23:40.987 --> 23:42.386
they take the bull by the horns,

23:42.388 --> 23:45.556
and they clear their own path,
and they move forward.

23:45.558 --> 23:48.626
A great example of that
is Precise Graphix...

23:48.628 --> 23:51.128
definitely one of
my greatest wins.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.131
Precise Graphix is
in Emmaus, Pennsylvania,

23:54.133 --> 23:55.833
and what they specialized in

23:55.835 --> 23:58.936
is making displays
for grocery stores.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.806
This is typically what I'd see,
a wall graphic.
DEAN: Correct.

This is something

Yes.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.110
The concept.
Yes.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.379
Brothers Keith and Dean
ran the place

24:08.381 --> 24:10.080
and their employees loved them,

24:10.082 --> 24:11.615
but were rightfully concerned

24:11.617 --> 24:13.751
because the business
was on shaky ground.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.286
I don't want
to go look for a job.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.354
I love my job.

24:17.356 --> 24:18.923
But I want to feel like
I'm gonna have a job

24:18.925 --> 24:20.624
for a long time.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.594
The opportunity for me
was that Precise

24:23.596 --> 24:26.630
can make designs and signs
for all of my businesses,

24:26.632 --> 24:28.966
so it's a win-win...
they make money

24:28.968 --> 24:30.868
and the businesses
get the benefit.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.870
We have a deal?
We have a deal.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.239
My original investment
in Precise

24:35.241 --> 24:40.144
was to invest $270,000
for 33% of the business.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.912
And as we went
through the episode,

24:41.914 --> 24:43.447
I gave them a couple of jobs.

24:43.449 --> 24:46.217
I gave them Camping World
to renovate a store.

24:46.219 --> 24:49.286
♪♪

24:49.288 --> 24:52.456
I gave them Auto Match,
which was Athens Motors.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.092
As soon as you walk in,
you're pretty much grabbed

24:55.094 --> 24:56.861
with a collage of color.

24:56.863 --> 25:00.064
And, for the most part,
the episode ended with

25:00.066 --> 25:01.999
them executing
on a couple of jobs

25:02.001 --> 25:03.334
and them coming up
with creative things.

25:03.336 --> 25:05.302
I would say
it was a decent win.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.204
All right.
[ LAUGHS ]

25:07.206 --> 25:09.640
What happened
in the months following

25:09.642 --> 25:11.542
was that after
the episode aired

25:11.544 --> 25:14.111
it was like a telethon
on their phone.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.880
Every business
that I could think of

25:15.882 --> 25:17.348
wanted to do
business with them.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.382
The phone's ringing
a lot more.

25:18.384 --> 25:19.550
I'll say that much right now.

25:19.552 --> 25:21.118
More business.
Oh, absolutely.

25:21.120 --> 25:27.391
My investment there today
is still only $270,000.

25:27.393 --> 25:31.362
And today what we have
is a $15 million business

25:31.364 --> 25:35.232
that lays across probably 13
or 14 different industries.

25:35.234 --> 25:38.068
They went from being
mildly profitable

25:38.070 --> 25:40.538
to wildly profitable
really quickly.

25:40.540 --> 25:44.708
Now, it is true that part
of their success

25:44.710 --> 25:47.278
was because they were able
to secure business

25:47.280 --> 25:49.213
with some of the businesses
that I owned.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.648
But I want to be clear...

25:50.650 --> 25:53.284
they still had to pitch it,
they still had to execute it,

25:53.286 --> 25:55.052
they still had to install it,

25:55.054 --> 25:56.687
and they still had
to run their business.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.589
Success story?
Yeah.

ALL: Team, family, pride!

26:01.694 --> 26:03.594
And so when I looked
at other businesses

26:03.596 --> 26:04.862
or other industries

26:04.864 --> 26:07.431
that would benefit from
my existing businesses,

26:07.433 --> 26:09.433
I thought lighting
would be a perfect one.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.535
So, Vision Quest
is a lighting company

26:11.537 --> 26:13.103
in Long Island that applied.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.005
And I thought to myself, "Okay.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.907
I own hundreds and
hundreds of businesses

26:16.909 --> 26:18.809
with tons of locations.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.144
They all need lights.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.745
This seems like
a pretty good idea.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.180
How bad could this be?"

26:23.182 --> 26:25.015
Now that I look back on it...

26:25.017 --> 26:27.318
bad... very bad.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.720
Vision Quest was owned
by a guy named Larry...

26:29.722 --> 26:32.356
as I called him
Larry the Lighting Guy.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.124
Oh, my God!
How you doing?

26:34.126 --> 26:35.426

26:35.428 --> 26:36.927
Oh, my God!
You're here!

26:36.929 --> 26:39.597
And it started out like a lot
of the companies I go to...

26:39.599 --> 26:42.299
the place was a mess,
there was no process,

26:42.301 --> 26:45.235
and there wasn't machinery
that actually worked.

26:45.237 --> 26:47.905
But the one thing
that was good is that

26:47.907 --> 26:51.175
Larry really understood
the intricacies of lighting.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.710
I was a theatrical-
lighting guy.

So, any place you go in,

27:02.922 --> 27:05.322
My original deal
was to invest...

27:05.324 --> 27:08.692
I think it was $375,000
for 50% of the business.

27:08.694 --> 27:11.095
I ended up spending close to
another half a million dollars

27:11.097 --> 27:12.463
on equipment

27:12.465 --> 27:15.866
and another 150 grand after

to tell me about.

But still, I assumed
that I could do what I did

and we're putting everything
we have into building this.

was to invest $750,000

"Do you ever go to
the store late at night?"

35:59.625 --> 36:01.358
So, in nearly 70 episodes,

36:01.360 --> 36:02.792
it's been interesting
for me to watch

36:02.794 --> 36:05.862
how people handle opportunity
and how they handle trust

36:05.864 --> 36:09.099
and how to bring back the good,
old-fashioned handshake.

36:09.101 --> 36:15.338

that really sticks for me

36:15.340 --> 36:16.773

all looked different,

a chance on them.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.999

propelled me through it.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.381
So they got a little
extra nugget for that.

37:31.383 --> 37:34.451
And they were in an industry
that everybody loves... pets.

37:34.453 --> 37:37.554

is that I would invest $400,000
