WEBVTT

02:24.896 --> 02:27.440
His wounds will heal.

02:36.074 --> 02:38.493
You saved my life.

02:38.576 --> 02:40.328
Thank you.

02:42.247 --> 02:45.625
But if I had not
spared your life,
you would now be in heaven.

02:46.501 --> 02:49.128
I believe you are
a Christian priest.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.047
Isn't that where you
would prefer to be?

02:51.506 --> 02:52.882
I am a priest.

02:53.925 --> 02:55.176
But I am also a man.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.513
I love God.

03:00.056 --> 03:01.307
I also love life.

03:01.391 --> 03:06.062
And what is it about life
that you love so much?

03:08.106 --> 03:09.274
Its joy.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.110
Its pain.

03:17.907 --> 03:20.243
And do you love human beings?

03:21.452 --> 03:23.496
Our Lord loved
all human beings.

03:23.705 --> 03:25.331
His love was...

03:26.124 --> 03:28.585
Agape, not Eros.

03:29.961 --> 03:32.088
A great, embracing love.

03:33.965 --> 03:36.926
And do you have that same
embracing love, priest?

03:37.802 --> 03:41.598
Do you love men and women
just the same?

03:45.226 --> 03:46.811
I am not our Lord.

03:47.979 --> 03:51.274
Agape is too hard for me.

03:51.566 --> 03:53.484
I love women...

03:55.153 --> 03:56.529
Not just spiritually.

03:58.948 --> 04:01.868
We have no problems
loving the spirit

04:02.035 --> 04:04.454
and the flesh.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.123
Our gods encourage it.

04:07.957 --> 04:09.417
Then you have no guilt?

04:09.792 --> 04:11.669
No remorse?

04:14.005 --> 04:15.006
No.

04:15.465 --> 04:16.758
I envy you.

04:20.553 --> 04:25.433
I have spent many years
of my life living sinfully,

04:27.935 --> 04:29.270
even in my thoughts.

04:32.023 --> 04:33.274
You're funny.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.569
Your thoughts
are your thoughts.

04:37.904 --> 04:40.281
But if you do terrible things,

04:41.908 --> 04:43.284
that is different.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.085
Why didn't you kill me?

04:56.839 --> 04:57.965
I don't know.

05:00.218 --> 05:02.553
Perhaps, we'll find out.

05:08.601 --> 05:11.521
You were too clever
for your own good, Ivar.

05:13.064 --> 05:16.526
We had the advantage,
and we lost.

05:19.028 --> 05:23.783
As I remember,
you approved the plan.

05:23.866 --> 05:29.789
Up until that moment,
you proved yourself
a good tactician.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.207
I believed in you.

05:32.625 --> 05:36.504
I might not be so quick
to endorse your plans
next time.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.884
You do as you see fit,
King Harald.

05:42.885 --> 05:45.263
Ivar, Uncle Rollo once told me

05:46.639 --> 05:49.308
on his ship on our way back
from the Mediterranean...

05:50.601 --> 05:54.480
He said that if I ever
needed his support,
all I had to do,

05:56.524 --> 05:58.776
was ask.

06:01.112 --> 06:02.405
What do you think?

06:05.658 --> 06:09.745
Come on. What do you think?

06:10.997 --> 06:12.623
Do you want the Franks
to help us?

06:15.668 --> 06:18.880
I think you ought to leave
at first light tomorrow.

06:31.684 --> 06:32.894
Yes, come on!

06:35.938 --> 06:37.356
- Steady!
- Here, I have it!

06:40.818 --> 06:41.861
You have to
let me through!

06:48.201 --> 06:50.036
I have been
thinking about Eyvind.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.415
- About his behavior.
- What about it?

06:55.374 --> 06:58.586
You told him that if he
did not like it here,

06:58.753 --> 07:00.796
he could always go back home.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.757
And he said
that we had burned
all our bridges,

07:02.840 --> 07:04.842
and can never
return home again.

07:04.926 --> 07:08.179
But that's not true.
He could always sail home.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.722
What really is to stop him?

07:10.765 --> 07:12.183
Nothing.
No.

07:13.226 --> 07:15.186
No, he has a reason to stay.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.104
Far from wanting
to leave this island,

07:17.188 --> 07:19.482
he wants to stay
because he wants
to be king of it.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.194
He could never be king
in Kattegat.

07:23.277 --> 07:27.532
But here, an uninhabited land,
a new world,

07:27.615 --> 07:29.575
harsh or not,
he could be king of it all.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.538
But first,
he has to undermine
your authority.

07:33.829 --> 07:36.332
He has to turn people
against you.

07:36.415 --> 07:41.087
That's what
he's been trying to do.
Can you not see?

07:41.837 --> 07:46.133
I have watched Eyvind
from the start,
and the truth is,

07:46.634 --> 07:48.844
he is trying
to provoke a reaction.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.515
He wants us all to fall
into violence and chaos,

07:52.598 --> 07:54.725
from which
he can rise to power.

07:54.809 --> 07:56.852
But we mustn't give him
that satisfaction.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.231
We must remain calm.

08:04.986 --> 08:05.987
Mother.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.369
Aud, what do you want?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.913
Just to talk.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.124
The men can't help
making mistakes.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.918
It's in their nature.

08:21.043 --> 08:25.590
They are all fire or all ice.
I know you understand that.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.259
Perhaps.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.137
But which men
are you talking about?

08:34.473 --> 08:39.061
Ketill and Eyvind.
Both great men.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.314
Both from prominent families,

08:42.148 --> 08:45.318
with nothing to prove
in terms of courage
or responsibility.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.321
If only we could
persuade them,

08:48.446 --> 08:50.323
forget their differences,

08:50.406 --> 08:52.742
to find accord
to live in peace.

08:54.118 --> 08:56.412
As women, surely,

08:57.872 --> 08:59.540
we can agree on that?

09:01.709 --> 09:03.628
I would agree with you.

09:05.254 --> 09:08.466
Except for one thing.
Mother.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.595
Ketill's father

09:14.305 --> 09:16.349
killed my brother.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.352
They argued about some land.

09:20.853 --> 09:25.316
Ketill's father shattered
his skull with an ax.

09:35.910 --> 09:37.286
What are you thinking?

09:43.501 --> 09:45.836
Are you thinking
about our child?

09:45.920 --> 09:47.463
Of course, I am.

09:50.049 --> 09:51.717
Then I'm glad.

09:56.222 --> 09:59.600
If we go to war again,

09:59.684 --> 10:01.102
don't tell me I cannot fight.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.146
Don't tell me to go away.

10:05.398 --> 10:08.984
Let me do what I have to do,
what I want to do.

10:13.698 --> 10:16.575
I want our child
to hear the cries of battle.

10:20.371 --> 10:21.831
I want him to be a warrior.

10:23.582 --> 10:26.460
You should
be so happy,

10:26.544 --> 10:28.003
but you're not.
You're not happy.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.506
We just lost a battle.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.552
So many died.

10:37.430 --> 10:39.181
Do you really think
I should be happy?

10:40.599 --> 10:41.726
Pull!

10:44.019 --> 10:45.020
Good.

10:45.396 --> 10:46.397
Pull!

10:49.275 --> 10:50.568
Hold there!

10:54.405 --> 10:55.656
Hey, Bul!

10:55.948 --> 10:58.159
Come and help us!
Thor is heavy!

10:59.744 --> 11:02.455
We don't want anything to do
with your temple, Thorgrim.

11:03.456 --> 11:05.124
It's your business.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.960
And we won't be paying
any taxes for it, either.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.378
The way you talk,

11:10.296 --> 11:11.756
you don't sound like a bull.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.008
You sound like a dog.

11:14.550 --> 11:15.968
So, that's what
I'm going to call you,

11:16.510 --> 11:17.803
"Bul, the dog."

11:24.935 --> 11:26.520
Say that again!

11:28.814 --> 11:31.650
Do yourself a favor, Bul.
Step back.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.449
Say it again.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.832
Bul, the dog!

11:51.337 --> 11:52.505
Bul, stop! No, brother!

11:53.380 --> 11:54.840
Stop him! Get him off!

11:54.924 --> 11:56.175
- No!
- Stop it!

11:56.258 --> 11:57.843
Get him off!

11:57.927 --> 12:00.012
Ketill, let him go.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.848
Father! Father, stop!

12:03.516 --> 12:04.892
Stop it!

12:06.101 --> 12:07.436
Put your weapons down.

12:16.862 --> 12:17.947
Come away, Bul.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.617
The boy
has learned his lesson.

12:25.663 --> 12:27.498
Come away, Bul!

12:49.061 --> 12:51.230
You are sure
they were Frankish soldiers?

12:51.313 --> 12:52.773
Yes. I'm sure.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.109
<i>And there are lots of them.</i>

12:56.443 --> 12:59.738
<i>I saw many, many ships.</i>

12:59.863 --> 13:01.031
<i>Too many to count.</i>

13:07.871 --> 13:10.666
Why would Rollo
send soldiers to fight
for Hvitserk and Ivar?

13:11.208 --> 13:12.376
I don't know.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.837
Maybe he is there.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.464
Maybe I could go talk to him.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.342
I'll go with you.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.761
No. Ivar would kill you.

13:24.346 --> 13:25.347
<i>I'll go alone.</i>

13:26.640 --> 13:30.436
<i>Maybe we can negotiate
some sort of agreement.</i>

13:30.853 --> 13:33.689
Perhaps King Harald
and Rollo will see sense.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.441
I wouldn't count on it.

13:40.112 --> 13:43.157
<i>They are
in a position of strength now.</i>

13:50.748 --> 13:51.999
<i>Where is Rollo?</i>

13:53.834 --> 13:55.377
Rollo couldn't come.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.088
He had
too many responsibilities.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.214
Mmm-hmm.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.467
But he also told me that

14:01.550 --> 14:04.595
he would come back
and celebrate
with us afterwards.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.763
Mmm-hmm.

14:11.477 --> 14:12.853
He only asked for one thing.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.231
And what was that?

14:19.777 --> 14:21.612
That we spare Bjorn's life.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.247
Mmm-hmm.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.672
Perhaps, we will.

14:46.470 --> 14:50.641
This temple
is dedicated to old man Thor.

14:50.724 --> 14:54.603
Thor, the Hurler.
Thor, the wide wanderer.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.730
Odin's son.

14:56.814 --> 14:59.441
- Odin's son.
- God of farmers.

14:59.525 --> 15:02.945
The god who fished out and
fought the world's serpent.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.595
The god who fought a giant,

15:28.679 --> 15:32.891
and who was left
with a piece of stone
forever lodged in his head.

15:33.267 --> 15:37.312
God of the thunder,
god of ordinary folk,

15:37.896 --> 15:39.523
hear our prayer!

15:39.732 --> 15:41.608
Hear our prayer.

15:41.692 --> 15:46.029
And bless our temple
and receive our sacrifice
in your name.

16:36.205 --> 16:37.664
Return the bowl.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.959
This is sacred.
Thor is here.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.379
Give me the bowl.
Give me the blood.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.385
All right. Have it!

16:55.265 --> 16:56.517
Floki!

16:56.809 --> 16:58.018
Floki, no!

17:37.224 --> 17:38.851
I want to dance
with the Christian!

17:48.402 --> 17:50.779
Down in the mud,
Christian!

17:58.328 --> 18:00.038
Get up, Christian!

18:08.338 --> 18:10.048
What are you doing?

18:10.841 --> 18:12.301
I wanted to talk to you.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.807
What did you want
to talk to me about?

18:19.349 --> 18:20.601
Everything.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.478
The gods. Life and death.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.857
My soul. The hanged man.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.151
Despair.

18:29.693 --> 18:30.736
Hope.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.530
Eternal life.

18:36.325 --> 18:38.118
Why with me?

18:38.201 --> 18:39.703
I think you may know
some of the answers.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.373
What gave you that idea?

18:45.667 --> 18:47.169
Do you believe in fate?

18:51.423 --> 18:52.591
Of course.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.928
Then fate
has brought us together.

18:56.762 --> 18:58.096
Don't flatter yourself.

19:01.516 --> 19:02.517
No.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.270
I think we are equals.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.649
I think you know that, too.

19:09.858 --> 19:13.028
I'm interested in you.
Fascinated.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.783
I want to know more.

19:18.408 --> 19:22.245
I think
we have more in common
than you know.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.834
And there is some urgency
to this conversation.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.171
What is so urgent, priest?

19:32.422 --> 19:35.175
I know we're going
to fight again, and soon.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.470
You don't have
to fight for us.

19:38.595 --> 19:42.349
Of course, I do.
That's why you saved my life.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.062
You hoped that I would
take up my sword,

19:47.854 --> 19:50.941
and fight for you,
against Ivar.

19:53.402 --> 19:54.945
Will you?

19:59.491 --> 20:02.494
I will fight
for you, Lagertha.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.748
I will die for you.

20:17.342 --> 20:20.971
Even though
you don't know me.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.305
Oh, I know you.

20:24.808 --> 20:27.602
I've known you my whole life.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.653
You really want to sin again?

20:47.789 --> 20:51.126
I shouldn't have married her.
I was too young.

20:53.253 --> 20:57.549
She is not
what I thought she was.
She has such ambitions.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.596
Unfortunately, I have left
my young children
in Margrethe's care.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.514
She will not hurt them.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.938
It seems
we'll do battle again soon.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.942
Either of us could die.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.445
It is almost certain
that one of us will.

21:21.198 --> 21:24.451
I don't want to die
without saying I wish it was
you who carried my child.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.283
I want Mommy.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.080
Margrethe.

22:10.205 --> 22:12.791
Margrethe, what is wrong?
We were calling you.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.174
Mommy.

22:24.845 --> 22:26.429
How stupid you are.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.350
What do you think
your mother is doing now?

22:31.393 --> 22:33.395
Perhaps, she is
getting ready to fight.

22:33.687 --> 22:38.024
Or maybe she's dead.
Maybe she has already died
in battle?

22:38.149 --> 22:39.734
She's not dead!

22:40.527 --> 22:44.406
My advice to you is to forget
about your mother.

22:44.489 --> 22:46.533
Don't think of her.

22:46.616 --> 22:49.244
Don't imagine
she's ever coming back!

22:51.705 --> 22:53.248
Except as a ghost.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.171
But where is Rollo?

23:01.298 --> 23:03.174
Where is my uncle?

23:03.258 --> 23:04.885
I went to meet him.

23:05.343 --> 23:08.096
He sends his love to you,
Bjorn Ironside,

23:08.179 --> 23:11.308
and hopes you're not
willing to fight
against his forces.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.810
Then why would he
commit his forces to you?

23:13.894 --> 23:16.313
He didn't tell.
That's the truth.

23:16.396 --> 23:19.107
Only that he was
prepared to do so.

23:19.524 --> 23:20.692
I can tell you.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.487
Rollo sees justice
in our cause.

23:25.530 --> 23:27.324
Lagertha murdered our mother

23:27.824 --> 23:29.451
and usurped her kingdom.

23:32.454 --> 23:35.332
All that is in
the past now, Ivar.

23:35.790 --> 23:38.835
I must avenge
my mother's murder,

23:40.378 --> 23:44.090
and I think you would do
the same if it was you.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.848
For the sake of our father,

23:54.684 --> 23:58.188
for the sake
of our father's legacy
and everything he believed in,

23:58.521 --> 24:00.231
I am asking you, Ivar,

24:01.733 --> 24:04.444
do not put
our people's lives at risk.

24:09.199 --> 24:11.368
The only reason
why you are saying this

24:11.451 --> 24:16.039
is because you see
all the might
gathering against you.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.585
If you still thought
you could win, you would not
be here, Bjorn.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.881
The fact is, you are afraid.

24:24.965 --> 24:26.424
I'm not afraid.

24:30.095 --> 24:32.055
This changes nothing.

24:33.723 --> 24:34.724
Well.

24:37.268 --> 24:38.979
What is this?

24:41.982 --> 24:47.570
You know as well as I do
that this is not our way.

24:47.654 --> 24:48.947
It's not our way!

24:58.873 --> 25:00.250
It was worth a try.

25:09.342 --> 25:13.013
I am sorry Rollo
had to involve himself
in our quarrel.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.980
Doesn't he have worlds
enough to conquer?

25:28.987 --> 25:29.988
Your Highness.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.246
My lords.

25:38.496 --> 25:42.083
I have summoned this witan
because it is now imperative

25:42.208 --> 25:46.171
that all of us recognize
the new and urgent dangers
we face.

25:46.337 --> 25:51.384
After the depredations
brought to this island
by the Great Heathen Army,

25:51.468 --> 25:54.721
we might well have thought
that the storm had passed.

25:54.888 --> 25:59.184
That Great Heathen Army
has proved to be just
the precursor of more attacks.

25:59.267 --> 26:03.229
Now their raiding parties,
their fleets, their armies,
come from everywhere.

26:03.521 --> 26:07.442
They attack Scotland
and Ireland with impunity,
and they attack us,

26:08.318 --> 26:12.113
like so many mad wolves,
like stinging hornets,

26:12.197 --> 26:14.908
swarming from north to south,
east to west!

26:18.620 --> 26:22.082
They are now a threat
to every English kingdom.

26:23.500 --> 26:28.379
Once, they would sting us
and quickly leave again.
But now, they stay!

26:28.463 --> 26:30.256
They winter on this island!

26:30.340 --> 26:33.426
They refuse to leave,
unless they are paid to do so.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.428
York has a Viking stronghold.

26:35.512 --> 26:40.600
How much longer before
more towns and kingdoms
have fallen before them?

26:42.102 --> 26:46.022
Our land and our faith
are together
in the greatest peril.

26:47.690 --> 26:50.110
That is why
I have summoned you.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.696
Tomorrow,

26:54.155 --> 26:57.951
we will discuss the best ways
of dealing with this threat.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.577
We must make plans.

26:59.953 --> 27:02.622
We must be strong
and resolute.

27:02.872 --> 27:03.998
And in that undertaking,

27:04.082 --> 27:08.336
I know that our Lord
and Savior, Jesus Christ,
will be with us.

27:08.419 --> 27:12.423
And if He is with us,
then we shall not fail.

28:39.093 --> 28:40.887
I've brought
you Alfred.

28:47.143 --> 28:51.648
All our sins are washed away
in the blood of Christ.

28:53.650 --> 28:56.527
Love one another.

28:56.611 --> 28:59.113
Do what is best for Wessex,

28:59.906 --> 29:01.199
and nothing more.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.036
My son.

29:30.019 --> 29:31.896
My son.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.399
Father.

29:39.696 --> 29:42.073
Come here. Come here.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.493
I never knew my own mother.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.997
She died when I was born.

29:50.415 --> 29:55.003
But you boys, you have
a care for your mother.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.797
Listen to her.

29:58.840 --> 29:59.841
Yeah?

30:00.883 --> 30:02.468
She is wiser than both of you.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.272
Oh, sweet Judith.

30:17.608 --> 30:19.193
Don't weep for me.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.698
The angels are already here.

30:25.366 --> 30:26.784
Can't you see them?

30:29.704 --> 30:31.122
Can't you see them?

31:19.962 --> 31:22.340
They won't make a deal.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.301
We have to fight.

31:26.302 --> 31:27.637
We have to fight.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.766
In the end,
we are all fighting
for my father's legacy.

31:32.892 --> 31:34.143
We've all believed in it.

31:35.520 --> 31:39.398
And we've all come
to understand how
a young farmer from Norway

31:39.774 --> 31:42.527
risked his life
to explore the world,

31:43.069 --> 31:44.695
so that our people could farm.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.490
That was his life's purpose.

31:48.533 --> 31:50.076
That was his life's ambition.

31:52.370 --> 31:54.247
I want us to achieve that.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.628
If Ivar wins,

32:04.173 --> 32:05.800
Ragnar's dreams are lost.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.930
Let us prepare.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.560
There is something to be said
for simple choices, no?

32:17.145 --> 32:19.981
We cannot leave Kattegat
totally exposed.

32:21.315 --> 32:23.109
We don't know Ivar's plans.

32:24.152 --> 32:27.071
I think we should send
a significant number
of warriors

32:27.155 --> 32:29.157
back to defend the town.

32:29.240 --> 32:32.869
No, you don't know what I saw.
The number of Franks.

32:32.952 --> 32:33.953
The gods

32:35.037 --> 32:37.498
have already decided
the outcome of this battle.

32:46.007 --> 32:47.842
The witan
will reconvene tomorrow.

32:56.517 --> 32:59.187
They must select a new king.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.276
They will offer you
the throne.

33:07.111 --> 33:09.030
Are you sure?

33:12.450 --> 33:13.701
Yes.

33:13.784 --> 33:16.829
Not only are you
Aethelwulf's eldest son,

33:18.039 --> 33:21.751
but they know how he has been
training you for kingship.

33:25.213 --> 33:30.343
Moreover, there are none
among them,
not even Cuthred,

33:30.426 --> 33:33.346
who has the power to claim it.

33:34.597 --> 33:37.808
Then in all humility,
I will accept.

33:40.102 --> 33:41.103
No.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.274
You will refuse the crown.

33:47.902 --> 33:49.445
But why on earth should I?

33:50.029 --> 33:51.989
You said yourself
that my father
had prepared me.

33:52.073 --> 33:54.867
Yes, yes, Aethelred.

33:55.034 --> 33:58.454
He has prepared you
to be a king in his own image.

33:59.664 --> 34:01.123
A warrior king.

34:02.458 --> 34:05.461
But these times demand
a different kind of ruler.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.546
Your grandfather
made that very plain.

34:07.630 --> 34:10.132
What could Ecbert know
of these times?

34:10.216 --> 34:11.509
Everything.
No.

34:12.051 --> 34:15.012
You only invoke his name
because you were his mistress!

34:15.429 --> 34:17.765
Which goes against
all Christian conscience!

34:17.848 --> 34:19.892
Brother.
Don't you speak!

34:19.976 --> 34:22.311
On the contrary,
he must speak!

34:22.520 --> 34:25.064
Whatever the circumstances
of his birth,

34:25.147 --> 34:26.565
Ecbert saw in Alfred

34:26.649 --> 34:29.151
the future ruler
of the country
he was creating!

34:29.235 --> 34:30.778
Yes!

34:30.861 --> 34:34.699
That is why
he sent Alfred to Rome.
Not you, Aethelred.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.535
He sent Alfred.

34:38.452 --> 34:41.289
The Pope blessed him

34:41.372 --> 34:44.959
and crowned him
because he knew.

34:45.209 --> 34:48.087
No! He didn't know.

34:48.170 --> 34:49.714
It could just as well
have been me!

34:53.968 --> 34:55.594
But it wasn't you.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.436
Ecbert saw in Alfred

35:04.020 --> 35:07.440
gifts you didn't have.

35:09.150 --> 35:13.237
Abilities you didn't have.

35:14.113 --> 35:17.199
He educated him
in ways of statecraft.

35:18.034 --> 35:20.286
He equipped him to be

35:21.329 --> 35:22.955
the future king.

35:40.389 --> 35:41.891
But they will still
ask me to be king.

35:42.224 --> 35:43.225
Yes.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.644
I am certain they will.

35:46.854 --> 35:48.272
Well, then.

35:57.073 --> 36:01.410
So, tomorrow, the witan
will decide upon our new king.

36:05.081 --> 36:07.917
It must decide
for Prince Alfred.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.962
My Lady, this is not...
It must,

36:12.129 --> 36:15.299
and it will decide for Alfred.

36:15.383 --> 36:16.926
And you, Lord Cuthred,

36:17.009 --> 36:20.137
you will be the first
among its supporters.

36:20.721 --> 36:24.016
No. I cannot,
in all conscience, agree.

36:24.100 --> 36:27.353
But let us say
you were able to.

36:28.604 --> 36:32.900
Would your conscience
allow you, as a reward,

36:33.067 --> 36:36.028
to accept the vacant bishopric
at Sherborne?

36:38.197 --> 36:40.032
As you know,

36:40.116 --> 36:44.537
such a high role confers
much more power and prestige

36:44.620 --> 36:47.748
than anything enjoyed
by the temporal lords.

36:48.958 --> 36:51.335
<i>And surely, My Lord,</i>

36:51.419 --> 36:55.840
<i>you have long aspired
to be Prince</i>

36:56.757 --> 36:58.759
<i>of our Holy Church?</i>

37:17.153 --> 37:19.071
As we know,

37:20.823 --> 37:22.116
King Aethelwulf,

37:23.534 --> 37:26.912
King of Wessex and Mercia,
Bretwalda,

37:26.996 --> 37:28.497
and my beloved father,

37:30.583 --> 37:34.044
is dead, and is now at peace
with his maker.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.427
We still don't know
the cause of his death.

37:41.510 --> 37:44.096
It was so sudden.
So calamitous.

37:44.430 --> 37:47.141
How such a mighty warrior
could be taken away from us,

37:47.224 --> 37:50.561
at such an hour of need,
is beyond understanding.

37:51.687 --> 37:53.856
Our Lord surely works
in mysterious ways.

37:54.773 --> 37:58.194
But now, we must choose
a new king.

37:59.445 --> 38:02.031
For that is our solemn
and sacred duty.

38:03.908 --> 38:08.662
And I have no hesitation
in nominating the King's
eldest son,

38:09.663 --> 38:11.749
Prince Aethelred!

38:13.334 --> 38:16.754
May he be anointed
as our new ruler!

38:17.171 --> 38:20.132
Fit to face
the terrible challenges
ahead of us!

38:20.966 --> 38:25.804
I say, let us elect Aethelred
as our king!

38:37.191 --> 38:40.945
Thank you, my Lord Cuthred,
for my nomination.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.949
To be your king
would be the greatest honor
of my life.

38:46.951 --> 38:49.245
Even in these times
of great danger.

38:57.711 --> 38:58.963
Unfortunately,

39:01.006 --> 39:02.508
I must decline the honor.

39:04.176 --> 39:06.095
I am not fit to be your king.

39:08.472 --> 39:09.807
You must choose someone else.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.311
My lords, be quiet!

39:15.104 --> 39:17.773
Silence, my lords, please!

39:17.898 --> 39:21.026
We have a great decision
to make. Please!

39:22.236 --> 39:23.904
In view to the fact that

39:23.988 --> 39:27.491
King Aethelwulf's eldest son
has refused the crown,

39:29.076 --> 39:34.582
then I think we must offer it
to his younger son,

39:35.082 --> 39:36.208
Prince Alfred.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.544
All those in favor?

39:40.504 --> 39:42.214
He's no warrior!

39:42.298 --> 39:45.092
He's too sickly.
He's not fit
to be king!

39:49.513 --> 39:51.932
My lords! My lords!

39:52.016 --> 39:54.893
Silence, my lords, please.
Silence.

39:56.437 --> 39:58.188
For the sake
of Wessex and England,

40:00.024 --> 40:02.359
in the name of my father,
King Aethelwulf,

40:03.235 --> 40:05.112
and my grandfather,
King Ecbert,

40:09.617 --> 40:15.205
I do nominate
my brother, Alfred,
to be king.

40:15.664 --> 40:18.167
All those
who agree say, "Aye."

40:18.542 --> 40:19.543
Aye.

40:20.419 --> 40:22.254
- Aye.
- Aye.

40:22.338 --> 40:24.131
- Aye.
- Aye.

40:24.214 --> 40:25.424
Aye.

40:27.134 --> 40:28.177
Aye.

41:01.794 --> 41:04.338
There's a fire! A fire!
Come quickly!

41:04.463 --> 41:06.298
A fire at the temple!
All of you, quickly!

41:08.258 --> 41:11.136
The temple is on fire!
Thor is burning!

43:04.666 --> 43:08.462
I've come to offer you
my fealty, Queen Lagertha.

43:08.712 --> 43:11.423
My sword is at your service,

43:11.507 --> 43:14.176
now and forever.

43:33.195 --> 43:34.822
Hey, Bul!

43:35.113 --> 43:37.115
Bul, the dog, you did this!

43:41.453 --> 43:43.872
Long live the King!

43:43.997 --> 43:45.624
Long live the King!

43:46.208 --> 43:48.126
<i>Long live the King!</i>

43:48.460 --> 43:50.629
<i>Long live the King!</i>

43:50.963 --> 43:55.467
Long live the King!
Long live the King!

43:55.592 --> 43:57.594
Long live the King!

44:11.817 --> 44:12.985
Burning the gods?

44:13.193 --> 44:14.862
You've gone too far, Bul.

44:15.571 --> 44:17.823
I don't think so.
Bul! No!

44:18.198 --> 44:19.366
Thorgrim, watch out!

44:20.075 --> 44:21.076
