00:57.360 --> 00:58.746
So,

01:01.320 --> 01:03.548
what are you gonna do for me?

01:05.160 --> 01:08.264
We're going to be straight
that I've had it.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.071
What do you say to the fact that...

01:14.800 --> 01:16.584
I'm gonna die?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.068
I'm going to miss you.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.270
Fuck that.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.622
I won't know about that.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.101
I need to know

01:32.360 --> 01:36.624
what you're worth
when I leave you nothing.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.791
Who wants the world at their feet?

01:45.200 --> 01:47.302
It's confusing, isn't it?

01:49.080 --> 01:51.990
I'll do the best I can.
You can go knowing that, okay?

01:55.080 --> 01:56.989
You're me now...

02:00.000 --> 02:01.784
If you'll have it.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.944
$10,000?

06:08.720 --> 06:10.151
Player wins.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.985
$20,000?

06:31.160 --> 06:32.671
Player wins.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.545
$40, 000?

07:00.080 --> 07:01.625
Player wins.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.941
Again.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.181
Again!

07:36.440 --> 07:38.941
Double it. Make it $80,000.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.260
Come on. Mister Lee can cover
a lot more than that, buddy.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.985
You must be new. Double it!

07:56.840 --> 07:58.590
$80,000.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.660
I hope you paid your rent, homes.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.791
I don't pay rent, homes.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.861
What's up, man? You got a problem?

08:45.520 --> 08:46.780
Issue of some kind?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.709
Yeah, I don't like your fucking hat.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.500
You know, I think you kinda
wanted me to have an issue,

08:52.600 --> 08:54.145
so I thought of that one.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.420
I'll see you outside, my friend.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.660
Oh, we all got to go
outside sometime, brother.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.670
This place is just a dream.
You a gambler?

09:03.880 --> 09:05.470
Not like you.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.706
You want to fuck around or you want
to cut cards for my last $500?

09:21.240 --> 09:23.342
I'll put 10 grand against your $500.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.982
I haven't got 10 grand.
That's an unequal bet.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.269
It's a unequal general situation.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.180
Well, fuck it. Get a deck.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.306
That's funny, no?

10:01.280 --> 10:03.781
I thought you wanted my business card.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.630
Congratulations.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.380
I know you.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.951
I think you're the kind of guy
that likes to lose.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.430
Life's a losing proposition, right?
You might as well get it over with.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.826
- Need a stake?
- You like staking losers?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.984
I know how you guys stake people.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.822
Then you know everything.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.660
Your luck is no good tonight.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.225
Oh, that depends,

11:25.840 --> 11:28.147
if you give me another $10,000 credit.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.987
You came in with $10,000 in cash.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.820
You didn't give it to me.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.990
Well, I mean, this is
a gambling establishment.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.222
Have I ever not paid you?

11:49.640 --> 11:52.027
Eventually a debt gets too big to pay.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.151
You owe me $240,000

11:59.320 --> 12:01.661
and I want it in seven days.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.061
He took it, man.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.389
Stake me 50 grand.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.944
At 20 points.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.024
Give him 50 grand.

12:33.280 --> 12:37.351
You make sure my man
over here has your digits and so forth.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.351
I feel better about your hat.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.305
This motherfucker.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.427
There's 40. I'm going to
keep back 10, okay?

12:57.720 --> 12:59.260
You know, you can take the whole 50
against my vig,

12:59.360 --> 13:01.986
but this is a gambling establishment.
I came to play.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.423
Just one blue $10,000 marker, please.

13:31.240 --> 13:32.500
No, no.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.180
Don't look at anyone.
You look at me. Just do it.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.385
21.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.263
Another satisfied customer.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.070
Let's play the two.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.264
$20,000?

14:18.560 --> 14:20.260
He doesn't want you to look at him.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.428
Just keep dealing the cards.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.544
$40,000.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.267
I'm good.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.427
Take it.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.271
Player wins.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.344
Don't look at him. There's no limit.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.420
He wants to fuck or fight,
and I'm not interested in either.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.460
So, please, just deal the cards.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.867
- It's for your protection.
- For my protection?

15:01.560 --> 15:04.540
Fuck my protection. You don't come here
for fucking protection from yourself.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.900
You come for the fucking opposite.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.180
And here I am.
So, please, deal the cards.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.506
Thank you.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.184
$80,000.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.861
Player wins.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.781
No more bets.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.300
You got me feeling lucky.
I'm putting everything on black.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.820
Red's been coming up all night.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.020
You want me to pay you now?
Is that what you want me to do?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.380
- No.
- Why not?

15:55.480 --> 15:57.787
Maybe I enjoy watching the show.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.460
What about ripping me off outside
if I win?

15:59.560 --> 16:01.583
Not in that business, brother.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.071
Everything on black.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.346
No more bets.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.825
Nineteen, red.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.864
Float me some spending money.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.429
That's at 20 points, too.

18:03.120 --> 18:06.064
First public notice that was
ever made of Shakespeare

18:06.240 --> 18:08.660
was from a Grub Street writer,
Robert Greene,

18:08.760 --> 18:12.660
who called him an "upstart crow
beautified with our feathers,"

18:12.760 --> 18:14.749
in the book...

18:16.080 --> 18:19.104
In the book,
under that title on the board.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.900
Is the beautified feathers thing because

18:21.000 --> 18:23.785
Greene knew that Shakespeare
was the Earl of Oxford?

18:24.280 --> 18:25.711
Absolutely...

18:26.440 --> 18:27.701
Not.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.829
Not even close!

18:30.520 --> 18:31.746
I...

18:32.040 --> 18:34.180
The Earl of Oxford
published poetry, okay?

18:34.280 --> 18:35.340
And it wasn't any good.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.860
I mean, had Oxford been able to get a play
put on, he'd have broken a leg to do it.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.860
I mean, can you think of any human being
that would, for any reason,

18:42.960 --> 18:45.062
not put his name on Hamlet?

18:46.280 --> 18:49.224
The Oxfordian thing.
The anti-Stratfordian thing.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.700
What pisses people off
about Shakespeare...

18:52.800 --> 18:57.069
What lies behind every controversy
about Shakespeare

18:57.320 --> 18:58.910
is rage.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.104
Rage over the nature

19:01.360 --> 19:04.623
and unequal distribution of talent.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.220
The rage that genius appears

19:07.320 --> 19:10.264
where it appears
for no material reason at all.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.184
Desiring a thing

19:13.720 --> 19:15.663
cannot make you have it.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.420
Now, the trouble with writing,

19:18.520 --> 19:20.987
if I may bring it up here
in the English Department...

19:22.120 --> 19:25.740
is we all do a little of it
from time to time, writing.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.910
And some of us start to think,
delusionally,

19:29.200 --> 19:30.620
maybe with a little time,

19:30.720 --> 19:33.740
a little peace, a little money in the bank,
and you get that room of your own,

19:33.840 --> 19:37.270
you think, "Well, shit,
I might be a writer, too."

19:37.720 --> 19:41.900
I mean, we accept genius in sports
as something we cannot do.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.020
But it's no more likely that
you could be a writer that

19:44.120 --> 19:46.700
you could be what?
An Olympic pole-vaulter?

19:46.960 --> 19:48.620
Because what you have to be

19:48.720 --> 19:50.982
before you try to be a pole-vaulter...

19:51.120 --> 19:53.063
Hello! Is a pole-vaulter, no?

19:54.080 --> 19:55.750
- Yeah!
- You are one.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.700
- A pole-vaulter?
- A novelist.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.660
No, I am not. For me to be a novelist,

19:59.760 --> 20:01.140
I would have to make a deal with myself,

20:01.240 --> 20:03.260
that it was okay being
a mediocrity in a profession

20:03.360 --> 20:05.340
that died commercially
in the last century.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.540
All right, people do that.
I am not one of them.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.820
If you take away nothing else
from my class,

20:09.920 --> 20:11.943
from this experience, let it be this...

20:12.360 --> 20:15.980
If you're not a genius,
don't bother, all right?

20:16.080 --> 20:19.220
The world needs plenty of electricians,
and a lot of them are happy.

20:19.320 --> 20:22.380
I'll be fucked if I'll be a mid-list
novelist getting good reviews

20:22.480 --> 20:24.582
from the people I give good reviews to.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.346
Let's have a look at Dexter. Dexter!

20:33.040 --> 20:35.461
An ordinary-looking young man
with a what?

20:35.640 --> 20:38.311
Size 40 jacket, regular features,

20:38.840 --> 20:40.140
and decent dentition,

20:40.240 --> 20:42.540
is the second-ranked
collegiate tennis player

20:42.640 --> 20:44.629
in the United States of America.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.460
How did that come about, Dexter?

20:46.560 --> 20:48.549
You come from a tennis family?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.420
Well, I mean,

20:51.520 --> 20:53.940
I started playing
five years ago in high school

20:54.040 --> 20:56.302
'cause the tennis guys
have the best weed.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.780
After you started tennis, how long was it
before you were better than everybody?

21:01.880 --> 21:03.420
Before I was better than everybody,

21:03.520 --> 21:04.667
or before I knew it?

21:04.960 --> 21:08.661
What happened when you noticed you
were naturally better than everybody?

21:09.560 --> 21:10.780
I...

21:10.880 --> 21:12.744
I got interested in the game.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.029
That is an IQ break point,
brother. Right there!

21:16.280 --> 21:17.300
Do you remember Machiavelli?

21:17.400 --> 21:19.070
That would have been in September.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.740
Man.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.590
I can remember September.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.340
All right.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.623
Is it the game, brother, or the money?

21:31.160 --> 21:34.460
Virtu or fama? Fame or virtue?
What are you after?

21:34.560 --> 21:37.982
Don't go modest on me. What do you want?

21:38.920 --> 21:40.146
Both.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.110
You got ambitious, yeah?

21:43.320 --> 21:45.980
I realised, as I learned about the game,

21:46.080 --> 21:47.500
that I was in reach of...

21:47.600 --> 21:49.225
In reach of...

21:50.440 --> 21:52.224
In reach of...

21:53.800 --> 21:55.231
Highest level?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.664
Highest level, yeah.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.224
Highest level.

22:01.440 --> 22:02.780
But it's still a gamble, isn't it?

22:03.600 --> 22:05.180
Look, I'm a literature teacher.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.460
I can't write well enough to bother,
or I just don't bother, whichever.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.860
Whichever it is, there'll be
no apotheosis around here.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.540
There'll be no "Vae, puto, deus fio!"

22:12.640 --> 22:13.700
around here.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.580
That's what Emperor Vespasian
said on his deathbed,

22:15.680 --> 22:18.147
"Dear me, I think I'm becoming a god."

22:18.800 --> 22:20.584
But do you know who does write
at the highest level?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.869
When most of us and even I...

22:23.040 --> 22:25.666
Even I write barely adequately?

22:26.320 --> 22:27.831
Do you know who it is?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.467
In this room. Who is it?

22:35.400 --> 22:37.980
Don't give me that look.
No, no, no, no, no.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.949
It isn't the one who talks the most.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.460
You're an NPR host, tops.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.707
Okay?

22:43.080 --> 22:45.262
The literary person in here

22:48.360 --> 22:50.144
is Miss Phillips.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.307
She's the least obstreperous
in this room,

22:54.680 --> 22:56.100
the quietest,

22:56.200 --> 22:57.825
and the only one

22:58.520 --> 23:01.100
who can have a real career at letters.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.946
Some of you can have one perceptually.

23:04.960 --> 23:08.462
Only she can have one in reality.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.950
She is better at writing

23:11.320 --> 23:13.100
than our U.S. presently
amateur number two

23:13.200 --> 23:14.426
is at tennis.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.420
Yet she chooses to hide,

23:16.520 --> 23:18.782
or just blend in with the rest of you.

23:19.680 --> 23:20.906
Why?

23:25.480 --> 23:27.309
Why is that, Miss Phillips?

23:30.560 --> 23:31.786
I...

23:33.720 --> 23:35.982
Being in the middle
is the safest place to be.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.665
Where do you come from?

23:41.560 --> 23:43.100
- Ohio.
- Ohio.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.740
Parents are geniuses, by any chance?

23:44.840 --> 23:46.066
Filthy rich?

23:46.880 --> 23:48.060
No.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.980
Well, your dad wasn't
the Earl of Oxford, was he?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.306
No.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.821
No?

23:53.560 --> 23:55.344
How old were you when you read?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.271
I was two.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.781
Two? Well, that's early.
That's prodigious.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.344
Any advantages? Literary home life?

24:05.920 --> 24:07.510
Who's your father?

24:09.280 --> 24:10.300
Well...

24:10.400 --> 24:11.660
He worked in a factory.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.146
Well, your mother?

24:17.840 --> 24:19.021
I don't...

24:19.760 --> 24:22.181
- What was...
- She was an alcoholic.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.351
She was insane.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.100
Wait, wasn't your dad...

24:26.200 --> 24:27.790
I don't see how this is pertinent.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.546
No money,

24:29.960 --> 24:32.381
no advantages, no peer of the realm.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.028
You're not the Earl of Oxford, are you?

24:35.760 --> 24:36.986
No?

24:38.120 --> 24:40.666
Then why are you better
than the rest of us?

24:43.960 --> 24:45.550
No, you look at me.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.300
You are better than the rest of us.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.260
If no one's told you yet
you're a genius and an artist,

24:51.360 --> 24:52.460
let me be the first.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.140
Okay. I don't know if you can say that.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.944
'Cause I think it's subjective, man.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.382
I mean, we all have something to offer.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.231
Bullshit.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.020
Genius is magical, not material.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.540
If you don't have the magic,

25:04.640 --> 25:06.420
no amount of wishing will make it so.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.540
Miss Phillips,

25:07.640 --> 25:09.629
if you plan to continue
to come to my class,

25:09.960 --> 25:12.546
you sit in the front where you belong
or don't bother showing up.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.305
Have a nice day.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.911
So, I mean, if you
can step in in some way, I...

25:27.200 --> 25:28.300
Dean Fuller?

25:28.400 --> 25:29.581
May I have a word?

25:30.160 --> 25:31.500
More words?

25:31.640 --> 25:33.300
The athletic department has asked

25:33.400 --> 25:34.940
how a certain person is doing.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.825
You mean the certain person
who cannot stay off his phone?

25:38.160 --> 25:40.260
I mean, you do realise
that this certain person

25:40.360 --> 25:43.060
cannot write at a high school level,
never mind a collegiate one.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.900
That doesn't matter though,
right? I mean, come on.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.260
Half the fucking
tenured faculty would be

25:46.360 --> 25:48.020
flogged to death for idiocy
at ordinary grammar school,

25:48.120 --> 25:49.460
in any previous century, so...

25:49.560 --> 25:51.150
Why would it matter?

25:51.440 --> 25:52.540
Why do you care about that

25:52.640 --> 25:54.708
if you don't care about anything?

25:54.880 --> 25:56.345
You're probably right.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.306
Motherfucker!

27:20.680 --> 27:22.703
I'll never beat you, Mr Dexter.

27:24.280 --> 27:26.901
But if you ever give me
a point again, I'll fire you.

27:35.680 --> 27:36.980
Good luck in the finals.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.341
Thank you, ma'am.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.461
Why do you need the money?

27:45.640 --> 27:48.180
If you were escaping for a purpose,
maybe I'd buy it.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.420
Well, going on as I am
is the only thing I've got.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.110
That's sophistical.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.061
It's beneath you.

27:54.760 --> 27:58.706
I think you would agree
that modification is possible.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.066
Do you?

28:03.480 --> 28:05.344
I know you're in real trouble.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.185
I know this is all connected
to your grandfather's death.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.942
But you're not narcissistic enough to

28:12.120 --> 28:14.143
put on a show,
nor are you an adolescent.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.940
And I think it goes without saying

28:16.040 --> 28:18.020
that you're far from stupid.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.506
You're my son.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.704
But you have to understand...

28:23.080 --> 28:25.460
I've said good-bye before
to people I love.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.230
Yeah, whatever did happen to Dad?

28:32.280 --> 28:34.109
I have done it many, many times.

28:35.160 --> 28:37.540
I don't want to know
the nature of your problem.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.947
I just want you not to have it any more.

28:44.440 --> 28:46.542
I'm not giving you any more.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.301
Hey.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.980
You Jim Bennett?

29:43.080 --> 29:44.909
- Yeah.
- Get in.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.705
Big Ernie.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.870
You're not that big.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.621
I'm not talking
about my jacket, brother.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.220
You know, with all due respect,
I'm not interested in your johnson, so...

30:13.320 --> 30:14.831
Sure you are.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.902
It has been so since the Greeks.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.710
I can't argue with that, I guess.

30:26.880 --> 30:30.223
A friend of mine says
that you're a teacher.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.550
I'm associate professor.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.860
The amount of cash you want is more than

30:37.960 --> 30:40.500
I am ordinarily disposed
to loan out, unless, say,

30:40.600 --> 30:42.620
you're a medium-sized
country with the ability

30:42.720 --> 30:45.426
to raise taxes under
the threat of military force.

30:45.560 --> 30:46.700
Or...

30:46.800 --> 30:47.900
a Eurotrash cokehead

30:48.000 --> 30:49.780
who has a father that can be squeezed

30:49.880 --> 30:52.580
after the little prick's
micro-budget sci-fi film

30:52.680 --> 30:54.220
doesn't get picked up at Sundance.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.751
Are you following me?

30:57.200 --> 30:59.220
You have family that can be squeezed?

30:59.320 --> 31:00.500
I'm saying that rhetorically.

31:00.600 --> 31:03.100
Let's just deal with this as gentlemen,
who understand each other, please.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.426
No.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.580
I need for us to treat each other
like we're not gentlemen

31:07.680 --> 31:09.703
and that we're very, very stupid.

31:10.200 --> 31:14.340
Okay. There's no family.
There's never any family.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.620
What do you make?
$100,000, $150,000 a year?

31:16.720 --> 31:18.231
$200,000 before taxes?

31:19.880 --> 31:22.460
What's wrong with you?
You got brain damage?

31:22.560 --> 31:26.100
Some fundamental disability?
$200,000 is a monk!

31:26.200 --> 31:27.700
And you, a monk,

31:27.800 --> 31:29.060
owe that Korean son of a bitch,

31:29.160 --> 31:30.540
that prince of fucking darkness,

31:30.640 --> 31:31.821
that much already.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.060
And then another $50,000,

31:34.160 --> 31:35.980
excluding the vig, to Neville Baraka,

31:36.080 --> 31:38.540
who will kill you,
because when you cut cards

31:38.640 --> 31:40.981
he got the king of spades
and you laughed at him.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.700
You're pretty well informed.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.220
You borrowed 50K
from a very dangerous man

31:45.320 --> 31:46.900
after he was already going to kill you.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.511
Yes, I did.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.660
Birth, education, intelligence, talent,

31:51.760 --> 31:53.060
looks, family money,

31:53.160 --> 31:55.140
has all this been
some real comprehensive

31:55.240 --> 31:57.183
fucking burden for you?

31:58.920 --> 32:00.900
I see two problems.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.944
One, the world at his feet,
in this town,

32:04.080 --> 32:05.300
and he's a fucking monk

32:05.400 --> 32:07.460
because, apparently, "Fuck it."

32:07.560 --> 32:10.260
Two, he wants to dance with the devil

32:10.360 --> 32:11.740
for some unspecified reason,

32:11.840 --> 32:13.940
and therefore owes money
to Korean murderers,

32:14.040 --> 32:16.820
and talks about a schvartze's hat
in a place where you can get killed,

32:16.920 --> 32:19.140
and they merely drop your body up
the Angeles Crest.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.300
Three, he wants to borrow

32:20.400 --> 32:22.420
a quarter of a million dollars
to pay off debts,

32:22.520 --> 32:24.620
which he will, in fact,
not pay off because,

32:24.720 --> 32:27.664
to go back to point two, he's suicidal.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.907
Just let me know
what you can do for me, all right?

32:32.720 --> 32:35.780
If I help you consolidate these debts,
even at a lesser load,

32:35.880 --> 32:39.024
do you think that I will be anyone
you want to fuck up the ass?

32:39.560 --> 32:41.940
Am I likelier to be fucked up the ass?

32:42.040 --> 32:43.710
Less likely, I imagine.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.822
Listen to me. Listen to me.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.705
I'm not your doctor.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.940
I'm not your cognitive therapist.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.551
But let me be your uncle.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.028
You have to pay 10% a week.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.380
I know what I have to do.

32:57.480 --> 32:58.660
Where you going to get my money?

32:58.760 --> 32:59.907
I'll get the money.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.670
How much you want?

33:01.880 --> 33:04.340
I am $260,000 all in.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.665
When's the last time you had money
in your hand to pay a debt and paid it?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.590
Don't fuck with me.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.267
This will be the first time
when you pay, am I right?

33:13.840 --> 33:15.101
That's right.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.705
We're not done.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.749
I need something from you.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.380
What, collateral?

33:30.480 --> 33:31.866
No.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.224
I need you to tell me,

33:35.080 --> 33:38.548
"I need this money because
I am a scumbag gambler.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.500
"I am a scumbag gambler

33:40.600 --> 33:42.380
"who is drowning in his own shit.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.380
"That's the kind of man I am, Frank.

33:44.480 --> 33:49.180
"And I want you to loan me,
a dying, suicidal asshole,

33:49.280 --> 33:50.711
"a lot of money."

33:51.040 --> 33:53.302
That's too much to remember. Repeat it.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.420
Well, I'll make it simpler for you.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.020
You want this money, you tell me,

33:57.120 --> 33:58.460
"I am not a man."

34:00.160 --> 34:01.421
Say it.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.382
Say, "I am not a man."

34:31.480 --> 34:32.741
Yes?

34:36.159 --> 34:38.262
Did you mean what you said?

34:38.679 --> 34:40.429
About me having talent?

34:43.000 --> 34:46.782
Is there something you don't get
about "A++, see me"?

34:49.000 --> 34:50.943
Then you never see me.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.782
Yeah, well, I don't want to see you.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.780
Because I've seen you
in your other life?

35:04.680 --> 35:05.941
No.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.950
No, it isn't that.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.983
Do you know why I'm in trouble here?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.820
Because I tell the truth.
That's what I do.

35:23.920 --> 35:24.940
Do you want me to split the atom,

35:25.040 --> 35:27.666
succumb to velocity,
and tell you the truth?

35:28.040 --> 35:30.461
Physiology doesn't lie.
Everything else does.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.140
Everybody else does.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.990
Physiology doesn't.

35:35.920 --> 35:37.988
It's post-intellectual.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.342
What are you trying to say to me?

35:40.560 --> 35:41.780
I'm not in any position to say anything.

35:41.880 --> 35:42.940
Try.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.540
Why should I try?

35:44.640 --> 35:46.185
Because what you said before.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.751
I need you to leave.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.460
Right now. All right,
this is not happening.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.741
I'm serious. Go. You have to go.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.580
I want you to sign this.

36:09.680 --> 36:10.740
Absolutely fucking not.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.980
I want you to fucking sign it.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.140
Look, I am not being dramatic, okay?

36:14.240 --> 36:15.340
But that was somebody else.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.820
You are being dramatic.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.660
Which is fine, because
the novel's basically okay,

36:18.760 --> 36:20.589
but that's what you are, a dramatist.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.100
Did you write this
because you believed in it,

36:23.200 --> 36:25.382
or because you thought
this is what people wanted?

36:33.960 --> 36:36.540
Well, what do you propose we move on to?

36:38.880 --> 36:40.500
When was the last time

36:40.600 --> 36:42.987
that somebody told you
that you're a genius?

36:43.440 --> 36:45.020
We're not having this conversation.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.904
I want to go to a restaurant.

36:48.280 --> 36:51.907
There's a whole bunch of things
I don't do any more, and that's...

36:52.280 --> 36:53.905
kind of up there.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.984
Guy with no money speaking.
How may I direct your call?

38:26.560 --> 38:28.344
I'm reading your book.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.220
Not bad.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.460
If you want to get into producing,

38:33.560 --> 38:35.660
there's only about a hundred grand
against it at Warner Brothers.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.191
Good script. I know the guy who did it.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.300
It's an indie at best.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.661
Yeah.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.431
Yeah. That's what they thought.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.980
I hear you went to Little Frankie
for some money.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.261
He wouldn't loan it to you.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.865
Well, you heard wrong, because he did
try to loan it to me and I didn't take it.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.944
You didn't like the terms?

38:53.920 --> 38:56.182
No, the terms weren't acceptable.

38:56.440 --> 38:58.030
But you're in to me.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.021
And I ain't Fannie Mae.
Ain't no bailouts.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.342
Oh, yeah, then why'd you
loan me the money?

39:03.920 --> 39:06.068
A gamble between two players
who like to play.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.706
Me and you.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.465
Double header.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.900
Let me give you a bit of advice here.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.100
What's that?

39:13.200 --> 39:16.031
You owe somebody money,
you don't fuck around.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.860
I want the money by Monday.

39:18.960 --> 39:22.382
I'll take that car of yours.
Consider it collateral.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.789
In The Stranger...

39:30.120 --> 39:33.303
Camus's protagonist fires five shots.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.060
The sixth shot of the revolver

39:35.160 --> 39:38.264
he is reserving,
symbolically, for himself.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.904
Noticing that, originally,

39:42.120 --> 39:43.904
is why I'm here now.

39:47.800 --> 39:48.901
Lamar.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.821
Lamar.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.982
You're taking notes or you're texting?

39:54.320 --> 39:56.422
You have anything you want to add?

39:57.560 --> 39:58.991
What do you think?

40:02.640 --> 40:04.380
Maybe the dude had a hammer

40:04.480 --> 40:06.540
on an empty chamber or something,

40:06.640 --> 40:09.141
or a weird French piece
that only took five.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.591
No, my idea works better
if he has a full six.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.785
I don't understand suicide.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.580
Well, that's because you're happy.

40:26.680 --> 40:30.102
You got a BMW M1. How you unhappy?

40:30.480 --> 40:31.911
Do I look happy?

40:33.520 --> 40:34.906
I'm not happy.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.591
You know why?

40:39.520 --> 40:41.941
Because I'm teaching the Modern Novel

40:43.400 --> 40:45.780
to a classroom full of students

40:45.880 --> 40:46.981
who don't give a fuck.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.540
You know,

40:51.640 --> 40:53.981
you really should have gone
for American Realism.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.142
I mean, let's have more fucking realism.

40:58.040 --> 41:00.268
I mean, shouldn't I be
teaching you things?

41:00.720 --> 41:02.780
Nah, I should.
I know all you're here for

41:02.880 --> 41:04.660
is a sufficiency of English credits,

41:04.760 --> 41:06.300
but, Jesus, if I'm here,

41:06.400 --> 41:08.309
I ought to be doing better. Right?

41:16.240 --> 41:19.662
I could stand here stark naked...

41:20.080 --> 41:22.300
and I could yell as loud as I want,

41:22.400 --> 41:24.389
and nobody cares.

41:25.080 --> 41:27.660
When you leave here today,
call your parents,

41:28.360 --> 41:30.620
and tell them you apologise
for wasting their time,

41:30.720 --> 41:32.260
and more importantly,
wasting their money,

41:32.360 --> 41:35.304
sitting in this classroom,
learning absolutely nothing.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.140
Let's start fresh.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.980
Let's clean the slate right now.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.023
Let me introduce myself.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.825
My name is James Bennett.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.990
I'm here pretending to teach.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.543
And you've been here
pretending to learn.

41:51.560 --> 41:54.345
This is what I want you to do.
Write down

41:54.920 --> 41:57.705
that he saves the sixth shot
symbolically for himself.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.180
You're not going to find
a reference anywhere, okay?

42:00.280 --> 42:02.380
Because I am the only one
who thought of it, all right?

42:02.480 --> 42:05.180
It's in a monograph somewhere
that got me into this situation...

42:05.280 --> 42:08.380
Where I can't, so I pretend to teach!

42:08.480 --> 42:09.741
And you pretend to learn.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.671
Lamar! The fucking phone!

42:17.120 --> 42:20.269
You stay after. Everybody else, just go.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.061
Go.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.546
Go!

42:25.160 --> 42:26.750
I guess, we should go.

42:27.640 --> 42:28.946
Coming?

42:34.960 --> 42:36.585
What do I have to do?

42:37.320 --> 42:38.860
What do I do? Get ten guys,

42:38.960 --> 42:40.380
some weapons, take out
a life insurance policy,

42:40.480 --> 42:41.660
and try to put that phone up your ass?

42:41.760 --> 42:42.740
Because I will.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.544
I need you to pay attention!

42:45.200 --> 42:47.462
Is that too much to ask for?

42:47.640 --> 42:48.700
You come into this class

42:48.800 --> 42:50.743
and you pay attention
for a fucking hour?

42:51.320 --> 42:54.105
You know, they expect me
to pass you, regardless.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.900
Regardless! They want me
to give you a passing grade,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.740
so you can keep going out there
and bouncing that basketball around.

42:59.840 --> 43:02.180
I need you to put the phone down
for a second.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.064
You're not the only one losing his shit!

43:06.160 --> 43:08.262
I was going to talk to you anyway.

43:08.560 --> 43:10.822
Because I can't talk
to anybody over there.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.860
'Cause all they going to say
is what keeps me in line

43:12.960 --> 43:14.107
for what they want me to be.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.580
Which is "Lamar,"
but I don't want to be "Lamar."

43:16.680 --> 43:17.941
I done all that.

43:18.120 --> 43:20.951
I just want to be another
fucking dude in the universe,

43:21.360 --> 43:22.791
or do more than just being "Lamar."

43:23.840 --> 43:25.300
Yeah, I know all about it.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.184
But the fucking coach
don't know about it.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.144
There's more than being "Lamar."

43:29.840 --> 43:32.750
I stick with this shit, man,
I'll go out of my mind!

43:32.880 --> 43:33.900
Probably be one of those brothers

43:34.000 --> 43:36.100
that talks to himself in,
like, third person and shit.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.270
Talk about how, "Lamar is
at ease with his celebrity."

43:39.480 --> 43:41.787
They got me in a box where they want me.

43:42.360 --> 43:44.269
Trapped by talent, imagine that.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.185
You know, man, in here it's all

43:46.360 --> 43:48.260
existential situations and shit.

43:48.360 --> 43:50.460
No matter what you start talking about,

43:50.560 --> 43:52.780
you come around
to be free or not to be free.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.100
How to be yourself or nothing at all.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.460
Is that what I talk about?
All or nothing?

43:56.560 --> 43:59.666
I've never heard you talk about
anything else but to be or not to be.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.823
And I've had four classes with you.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.345
Maybe you got me.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.665
I need to go pro.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.980
I don't think you're going to
have any trouble, Lamar.

44:19.080 --> 44:22.024
I don't mean later.
I mean now. I need to go pro.

44:24.920 --> 44:26.510
I already got a knee.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.820
Nobody knows about it,
'cause I don't say anything.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.146
But I already got a knee.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.660
See, I'm not going to
sit here and tell you

44:33.760 --> 44:35.340
that my mom needs an operation,

44:35.440 --> 44:37.349
or my little sister has spina bifida.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.980
But I am going to tell you
that I got a knee.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.660
I got a knee. I'm a junior.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.820
And whenever I tell somebody
I don't wanna play college ball

44:44.920 --> 44:47.830
in my senior year, nobody listens to me.

44:48.120 --> 44:51.030
It's like I'm talking Chinese
on another fucking planet!

44:52.080 --> 44:54.500
And then the coach tells me I don't have
the market value I would have

44:54.600 --> 44:56.270
if I don't play out my senior year.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.381
But what he doesn't know
is I got a fucking knee.

44:59.800 --> 45:02.062
You have it looked at
away from the department?

45:02.920 --> 45:04.101
Yeah.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.909
Yeah, that's right. All right, here's Allen
bringing it up the court on a fast break.

45:17.080 --> 45:19.023
Moves to the top of the key.

45:20.080 --> 45:21.420
Lamar drives.

45:21.600 --> 45:24.590
Throws it down, and he's fouled! Yes!

45:25.800 --> 45:28.426
Allen at the line
to complete the three-point play.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.700
After what's happened in
the last two and a half minutes,

45:32.800 --> 45:35.949
there is no way Lamar
is missing this free throw.

45:36.280 --> 45:38.500
And swish. His eyes on the prize.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.340
Oh, here's Fisher inbounding the ball.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.180
Wildcats bringing
the full court pressure.

45:42.280 --> 45:44.700
Martin bringing it up the court.
Three seconds on the clock.

45:44.800 --> 45:45.860
Passes cross court.

45:45.960 --> 45:48.220
Allen, from out of nowhere, tips it!

45:48.320 --> 45:50.860
This one is over! Wildcats have done it!

45:50.960 --> 45:53.108
Oh, my, oh, my!

45:53.440 --> 45:57.860
Lamar Allen, one of the best
basketball players in the game.

45:57.960 --> 46:00.791
All season long, he produced
at a high calibre of play...

46:12.360 --> 46:13.950
Did you have money on the game?

46:14.520 --> 46:16.420
Why would I have money on the game?

46:16.520 --> 46:18.940
He's a student of mine.
That's unethical, all right?

46:19.040 --> 46:20.620
I would not bet on a student of mine.

46:20.720 --> 46:22.260
You think I would do
something like that?

46:22.360 --> 46:24.781
I would never
do anything like that, okay?

46:25.200 --> 46:27.587
What kind of a person do you think I am?

46:27.840 --> 46:29.465
Do I have money on the game!

46:36.320 --> 46:37.945
Is he good at English?

46:39.200 --> 46:40.665
No, he's not!

46:42.720 --> 46:44.620
Fucking doing in my fucking house.

46:44.720 --> 46:45.940
Fuck!

46:46.040 --> 46:48.142
How bad is this trouble you're in?

46:48.920 --> 46:49.980
I'm always in trouble.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.306
No, I mean,

46:52.000 --> 46:53.660
do you still need money?

46:53.760 --> 46:55.703
- No.
- Truthfully?

46:55.920 --> 46:57.181
Truthfully.

46:58.200 --> 47:00.621
I never know
when to believe you any more.

47:01.520 --> 47:03.300
Perhaps I should believe the gangster

47:03.400 --> 47:05.343
who phoned my home.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.031
What's that?

47:20.920 --> 47:22.181
What I owe.

47:26.040 --> 47:28.620
Jesus. How is this possible?

47:28.720 --> 47:30.260
Same as your marriage. I lost.

47:30.360 --> 47:31.340
No.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.224
Marriage is in the real world.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.300
It's not a game of chance.

47:36.400 --> 47:37.990
Now you're talking crazy.

47:38.280 --> 47:40.382
What'll they do to you if you don't pay?

47:40.600 --> 47:42.660
Break every bone in my body.

47:42.760 --> 47:44.066
Go after the family.

47:48.920 --> 47:50.670
I can't help doing this.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.222
I don't believe this is a disease.

47:53.440 --> 47:55.860
Well, I just had a considerable
conversation about character.

47:55.960 --> 47:58.180
And there's going to be a moment
when I want something again,

47:58.280 --> 48:00.700
when I won't allow myself
to be seen in this condition.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.820
But it's not now, and it's not up to you

48:02.920 --> 48:05.591
or anything you or anybody
else fucking says, okay?

48:16.320 --> 48:19.902
Are you degraded enough
to come with your mother to the bank?

48:34.280 --> 48:35.900
In cases like this I have to ask,

48:36.000 --> 48:37.431
is everything okay?

48:37.760 --> 48:39.510
Nothing's okay,

48:39.840 --> 48:42.420
when someone needs
that amount of money in cash.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.220
But it's my money,

48:45.320 --> 48:46.945
and it's none of your goddamn business.

48:49.320 --> 48:50.581
Are you a relation?

48:51.160 --> 48:52.750
This is my son.

48:53.080 --> 48:55.100
Either you can't see
the uncanny resemblance,

48:55.200 --> 48:56.950
or you're implying
she's under duress or something.

48:57.160 --> 48:58.260
Should I be?

48:58.360 --> 48:59.541
Look, dear,

49:00.680 --> 49:03.386
it's my money and there's plenty of it.

49:05.040 --> 49:06.580
And don't even start to tell me

49:06.680 --> 49:08.860
that all of this bullshit
is for my protection,

49:08.960 --> 49:10.425
because that is understood.

49:10.680 --> 49:12.987
Now, you have the withdrawal slip.

49:14.040 --> 49:16.791
Here is my I. D.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.940
There are sufficient funds.

49:20.040 --> 49:22.260
My family has been with this bank

49:22.360 --> 49:24.827
since my father-in-law started it.

49:25.520 --> 49:26.780
Now, what I want

49:26.880 --> 49:29.301
is $260,000...

49:30.400 --> 49:31.661
in cash.

49:32.400 --> 49:33.990
Are you sure you want that in cash?

49:36.720 --> 49:39.664
Cash. Okay? Cash.

49:40.080 --> 49:41.220
I'm sorry, I'm going to ask for...

49:41.320 --> 49:42.300
What?

49:42.400 --> 49:44.502
For a second piece of identification.

49:45.480 --> 49:47.344
It's for your own protection.

49:53.640 --> 49:55.265
This is the last of it.

49:55.520 --> 49:58.140
If I ever have to hear
about your problems again,

49:58.240 --> 50:00.866
I will never see you again.
Do you understand that?

50:04.600 --> 50:07.180
I need you to fucking understand that!

50:10.080 --> 50:11.625
Am I embarrassing you?

50:11.760 --> 50:13.703
Do you want to just take the money?

50:13.920 --> 50:16.307
You want to just take the money and go?

50:17.400 --> 50:19.300
Even if I say goodbye

50:19.400 --> 50:22.344
and consider it cheap to be rid of you?

50:23.440 --> 50:26.191
Yeah, I want to take the money and go.

52:07.200 --> 52:08.426
Hey.

52:11.840 --> 52:12.987
Hey.

52:14.720 --> 52:18.300
If I have to pull you into an inappropriate
relationship to get you out of your job,

52:18.400 --> 52:19.990
I'm ready to go.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.500
So am I.

52:54.040 --> 52:56.268
What if I told you
that I'm not a gambler?

52:59.080 --> 53:00.820
What if you saw me
with a needle in my arm

53:00.920 --> 53:03.022
and I told you that I'm not a junkie?

53:03.760 --> 53:04.980
I saw you be a professor

53:05.080 --> 53:06.670
and I know you're not one of those.

53:09.760 --> 53:11.225
Yeah.

53:11.440 --> 53:14.225
It's good to come out here. It's good.

53:17.960 --> 53:19.980
I come out here because
it makes me feel alive.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.100
No.

53:21.200 --> 53:23.460
No. No. Not good enough.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.340
There's something else,
I don't quite know what it is.

53:25.440 --> 53:28.384
I know a lot,
but I don't fucking know that.

53:30.920 --> 53:32.820
"And I always sat on a blanket
in the middle of nowhere

53:32.920 --> 53:35.100
"with nothing around me
but infinite possibilities,"

53:35.200 --> 53:37.746
and it's bullshit. I'm sick of it. So...

53:39.800 --> 53:41.300
You are the perfect example

53:41.400 --> 53:44.743
of how a person can start off
with no problems whatsoever,

53:44.920 --> 53:46.060
and then go out of their way

53:46.160 --> 53:47.830
to make sure that they have all of them.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.540
There's no relative degree of suffering.

53:52.640 --> 53:54.424
What, you want me to
talk about my problems?

53:54.560 --> 53:58.107
Well, I don't like people with problems
or the fucking vanity to bring them up.

53:58.240 --> 54:00.024
That's where I'm from.

54:03.920 --> 54:05.749
I'm like my mother.

54:06.240 --> 54:08.220
You know, whether I'm like my father
or not I couldn't tell you,

54:08.320 --> 54:10.104
because she got rid of him
when I was little.

54:10.320 --> 54:13.344
And you don't think that
you need to talk to anybody?

54:13.960 --> 54:15.107
No.

54:15.320 --> 54:17.104
I need a lot of things.

54:18.240 --> 54:19.910
I need to wipe myself out first.

54:20.520 --> 54:23.942
I need to have no past. If I can get to
nothing, then I can start over.

54:31.280 --> 54:32.740
Hello!

54:32.840 --> 54:34.146
Echo!

54:35.360 --> 54:37.064
Do you want to help me start over?

55:12.160 --> 55:14.300
There is something wrong
with everybody here.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.780
They should be in the hospital.
Yeah, that's right, but they're not.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.380
All right, the Man wants you
to be in the hospital.

55:18.480 --> 55:19.980
These people are fucking Americans

55:20.080 --> 55:21.620
taking a major stand for freedom.

55:21.720 --> 55:23.580
Well, assisted autonomy.

55:23.680 --> 55:25.300
This is the inside of my soul, kid.

55:25.400 --> 55:26.740
This is what I got.

55:26.840 --> 55:28.021
Wow.

55:29.240 --> 55:31.502
Well, at least
I'm going to get rid of my mother.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.787
This table right here. Come on.

55:40.760 --> 55:42.430
Buy-in at $10,000.

55:43.160 --> 55:44.546
How far you going, man?

55:44.760 --> 55:46.464
As far as it goes, buddy.

55:46.680 --> 55:48.862
I go as far as that seat
on the other side of you, man.

55:50.600 --> 55:52.543
Save it for the old lady, cowboy.

55:58.600 --> 55:59.620
That's $500, sir.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.551
Yes, it is. Are you a dealer
or an investment counsellor?

56:07.600 --> 56:08.906
Double.

56:12.040 --> 56:13.340
We gambling or what?

56:13.440 --> 56:14.620
Let's go. Give me the three.

56:14.720 --> 56:15.981
Is he kidding?

56:18.880 --> 56:20.061
Whoa.

56:20.560 --> 56:21.900
What are you, Houdini?

56:22.120 --> 56:23.984
Pulled that one out of your ass.

56:26.760 --> 56:27.820
Wow.

56:27.920 --> 56:29.067
Unbelievable.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.662
Pulls a three on an eight.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.910
Unbelievable.

56:36.640 --> 56:37.821
I'm sorry.

57:07.840 --> 57:09.624
I'll play another $10,000.

57:13.120 --> 57:14.585
Buy-in at $10,000!

57:29.880 --> 57:31.630
Give me the bag.

57:46.560 --> 57:47.780
That's $500, sir.

57:47.880 --> 57:49.266
It's not $500.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.311
$1,000.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.825
Another $500.

57:54.400 --> 57:55.620
It's $2,000.

57:55.720 --> 57:56.780
Deal the cards, please.

57:56.880 --> 57:58.345
$2,000 plays.

58:09.480 --> 58:10.991
Buy-in at $10,000!

58:22.880 --> 58:25.028
Buy-in at $10, 000!

58:38.280 --> 58:40.030
Buy-in at $10, 000!

59:23.720 --> 59:24.901
Everything?

59:46.160 --> 59:48.422
You want to hear something
really fucking crazy?

59:50.520 --> 59:53.420
There was a student, just the other day,

59:53.520 --> 59:54.700
who said that my problem,

59:54.800 --> 59:56.180
if one's nature is a problem

59:56.280 --> 59:58.860
rather than just
fucking problematic, right,

59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.900
is that I see things
in terms of victory or death,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.421
and not just victory but total victory.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.305
It's true.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.660
I always have.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.783
Well, it's either victory
or don't bother.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.740
The only thing worth doing
is the impossible, right?

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.740
Everything else is fucking grey.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.580
You're born as a man
with the nerves of a soldier,

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.740
the apprehension
of an angel, to lift a phrase,

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.100
but there's no fucking use for it.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.462
Here? Where's the use for it?

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.780
What, you're set to be a philosopher
or a king or fucking Shakespeare,

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.860
and this is all they give you? This?

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.460
What? 20-odd years of school, which is
all instruction in how to be ordinary.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.900
They'll fucking kill you,
and they fucking will!

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.260
You know, and then it's a career, right?

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.145
Which is just not the same thing
as existence, so...

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.420
I want unlimited things.
I want everything.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.740
I want a real fucking love,
a real fucking house,

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.780
a real fucking thing to do every day,

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.266
and, I just...

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.467
I'd just rather die if I don't get it.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.264
Did I just say that out loud?

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.940
Hey, Jim!

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.461
You stopped answering your phone.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.820
I told you the time frame.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.864
What the fuck do I care
about your time frame?

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.860
So you don't die.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.550
Everybody dies.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.700
Aren't you afraid of dying from
something other than natural causes?

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.300
I got to take whatever's coming,
because I don't have the money.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.540
Your grandfather pops,
and you don't have any money?

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.540
Well, my grandfather thought
it was a character builder. So...

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.071
Not even, "I'll have it"?

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.264
You just say no.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.544
You give the Korean any of his?

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.341
No.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.431
You know Lamar Allen?

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.661
No.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.908
Don't fuck with me!

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.431
He's a student of mine.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.420
And what's this got to do with anything?

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.941
You know what this got
to do with everything!

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.625
How much you know Lamar?

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.983
Hey, Jim, pick up.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.061
Jim!

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.100
I called that number for Lamar
and it wasn't the number.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.268
Now, Jim, I need Lamar.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.903
And I know where you live.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.141
Tick-tock, motherfucker.

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.230
Human weakness is not
something I discourage.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.191
How could I?

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.301
I run gambling establishments.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.225
I loan money.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.346
I've not been in debt
for many years, but,

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.225
I still remember the feeling.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.180
What's that?

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.348
To be obligated.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.222
Unbalanced in one's thoughts.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.742
Insecure, unclean.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.142
I think you want to hurt yourself,

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.263
but make others do it for you.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.820
I'm not going to tell you
I'll get the money, all right?

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.671
Because I don't know if I can,
and I wouldn't insult you.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.220
It doesn't make any difference.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.582
I mean, I have no position, right?

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.947
You expected your money
and I don't have it.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.382
Here we are.
What the fuck do you want to do?

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.270
How am I to collect?

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.785
Loan me another $100,000.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.942
It's how I got in.
It's the only way I'll get out.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.468
One Mississippi,

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.310
two Mississippi,

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.984
three Mississippi,

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.264
four Mississippi,

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.550
five Mississippi...

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.671
Fuck!

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.670
It's not so bad.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.785
Not so bad.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.303
Perfectly good watch.
Why do you want to sell it?

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.300
Well, either I don't need
to know what time it is

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.820
or I need money. What do you care?

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.100
Well, I need to know if it is...

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.587
No, what you need to do
is just come up with an offer or not.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.300
We have so many of these here.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.900
Look, it's an Omega.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.620
It's worth more than $6,000 brand new,

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.780
and when you have it

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.500
no one'll know that it isn't brand new.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.780
You are insulting me. Why?

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.740
- I'm insulting you?
- Why are you insulting me?

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.500
- We're not gonna fuck around.
- We're doing business.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.180
No, no. Don't even talk to me any more.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.660
I want you to understand
when I say what I want for it,

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.340
I am giving you the figure
that I will take for it.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.460
Do you understand me?

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.580
No, no, no. Look at me!

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.860
I will say the price now
and you will either say yes or no.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.221
Do you understand?

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.340
It is impossible.
Impossible to say yes or...

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.460
All right.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.310
Wait. Wait, wait.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.780
It is a good watch.
I am good man, you are good man.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.700
No. I told you, not to say
anything but yes or no.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.860
You're wasting my time!

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.745
I am willing to
listening to your price. Okay?

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.180
You can't counter it.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.260
When I say my figure, that's the figure,

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.588
and you either say yes or no.
You got it?

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.222
How can I say yes or no
if I am not hearing the price?

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.020
You're not getting it.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.380
- I am getting it.
- You're not getting it.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.540
- I am getting it.
- No, no, no.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.060
- You're not getting it.
- I am getting it!

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.860
You need to understand fully
that what I say

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.060
is not an opening figure.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.500
You can say yes or no.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.820
You cannot say a lower figure, and expect
to meet me at some point in the middle.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.620
Do you under-fucking-stand?

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.900
Please. Please.
We are amour, yes? Amour.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.751
Okay? Calm. Calm. Yes?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.023
I understand. What is your price?

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.582
$3,500.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.740
$1,000.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.900
- $1,200.
- Go fuck yourself.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.060
I don't give a shit!

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.900
No need for this!
What? Where are you going?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.387
What are you doing? Wait one second!

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.260
Please, please, I can't help myself.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.109
Yes, you can. Try.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.231
$2,000?

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.340
What? It is good price!

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:25.225
And I'll give you cheque! Is no problem!

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.585
- Get in.
- All right.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:08.468
Jim!

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.823
Man, you gave me
the wrong number on Lamar.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.785
You know what else I know?

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:15.580
What's that?

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:18.140
You think all Koreans
are Korean and shit.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:21.184
And they don't communicate
with the American negro!

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.740
I heard you asked Mister Lee to
stake you out of your situation.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.500
And to give you enough
to have a shot at the title

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.180
of being the world's stupidest asshole!

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.140
Give me Mister Lee's money.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.620
- He didn't front me any.
- Yeah, fuck you.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.580
Well, your information is wrong.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.819
How am I gonna get my money, Jim?

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.386
What if I told you I quit my job
and I'm gonna write a novel?

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.026
Really?

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:46.779
What did the first one make?

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.029
With the advance and royalties,
$17,000 all in.

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:54.260
Fuck me. For one of the better
reviewed first novels of 2007?

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.860
I think I'll make other arrangements.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.820
I mean, the culture apparently did.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.460
So let's talk cash first,
other business later.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.900
What about your family?

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.460
I got all I could get.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.500
Can I get the money from them
if I send you to Mexico?

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.980
You know, "Oh, my God,

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.340
"I don't know what happened to him!"

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.542
Get my friend Valerio
to mail them your dick.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.381
My family didn't make their money
because they pay up easily.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.185
Apparently that's genetic.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.820
I'll tell you, boy, genetics,

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.909
cruel motherfucking mistress.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.060
What if I lit a cigar and
put it out in your eyeball?

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.300
Would you give me the money then?

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.070
Do I look like a magician?

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.540
You must've thought
you was magic occasionally,

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.105
or else you wouldn't be in the African
Membership Club owing me 60 grand.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.062
I'm gonna need the equity
on your house, Jim.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.060
We'll paper it right as a sale.

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.060
But then I got to take over
the goddamn mortgage,

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.980
find some fucking vice president
of animation to rent it to...

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.501
And I don't fucking wanna do that shit!

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.785
But you got to make the turnip bleed
from whatever hole it's got, right?

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.580
Now, your grandfather, I respect him,

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.191
he's a businessman.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.340
But Lamar, who you gave me
the wrong number for...

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.500
Lamar's a good kid, all right.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.031
He doesn't need any of this shit.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.109
You gonna tell me you made
a mistake with the number?

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.380
Why would I tell you I made a mistake?

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.309
I gave you a fake one. I made it up.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.700
Okay.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.145
Well, see, my man Mr Jones here
is going to give you the real one.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.623
That is the last time
that you lie to me, my friend.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.900
Lamar don't need your help.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.060
Every man's got to go it alone, Jim.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.900
And Lamar's got to make his own choices.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.943
So let him make it.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.623
Now, I'm not gonna call him.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.987
That would merely confuse the issue.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.144
But you're gonna get me Lamar.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.981
And it will be more
than an introduction.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.302
In fact, I don't even want
an introduction.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.980
Lamar's going to do exactly
what I want him to do

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.300
without ever seeing my face.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.185
I need him before the game
tomorrow at home.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.460
Now, they're running
eight points on Michigan.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.300
You tell Lamar he can win if he wants,

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.140
but no more than seven.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.503
But you get him for tomorrow.
Because if not,

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.711
I'm going to kill that
pretty little blonde girl,

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.101
show you the pictures,
and then kill you next.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.820
Hey, what's happening, man?

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.340
Man, making it do what it do.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.340
Yes, sir!

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.030
No doubt.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.064
What happened to your face?

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.026
Whatever happened, it already happened
and won't happen again.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.540
So you're starting to make promises now?

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.549
No, that's not happening.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.591
You don't get it.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.900
What's going on?

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.460
I'm getting out of here as fast as I can

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.740
as everybody and their fucking aunt
is eyeballing me right now.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.340
It might be better if you weren't
chasing along as if you're my wife!

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.580
Jesus Christ.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.740
I tell the truth, all right.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.066
- That's all I got.
- No.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.546
No!

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.140
You can't talk to people like that.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.785
Really? Who says?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.943
Who says?

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.071
I do.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.820
I want you to stop
looking concerned, okay?

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.660
And I want you to shake my hand.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.540
And you know the kind
of fucking man I am.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.105
Don't lie to yourself. I don't.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.100
What happened?

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.540
Nothing happened.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.627
You're not getting it, okay? Just...

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:05.940
If I come to your door,
then I'll have made it,

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.180
and everything will start
to be all right.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.740
If I don't,
then I didn't fucking make it!

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.591
And what you do with the dead
is bury them, that's it!

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.381
You really hate yourself that much?

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.622
Hold out your hand and say goodbye.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.426
Please.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.667
Please?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.910
It's really fucking easy
to be passionate about

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.631
Robert fucking Greene!

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.708
One, two, three, four.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.664
What happened to your face, man?

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.860
A little while ago
you came to me for advice

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.780
about turning pro.
I know it's about your knee.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.620
I know you have a feeling
you have to put money in the bank.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.901
So...

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.226
I was wondering if you'd like
to make $150,000 in two hours.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.862
Depends on what you have in mind.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.745
Throwing a game.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.665
You can't win tomorrow
by more than seven points.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.266
That's not throwing a game.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.220
That's winning by less than eight.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.910
Who wants me to do it?

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.911
What they got on you?

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.671
Doesn't matter.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.263
Man, they fucked you up.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.580
But they ain't need to fuck you up.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.420
No, I needed it.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.900
And they'll fuck you up
if you need it, too.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.545
You gotta deliver.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.500
I'm asking because I know you need it.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.940
It's up to you. It's your call.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.380
I do this, I get you out of trouble?

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.706
No.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.467
Hey.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.981
Where did a teacher like you
get that kind of money?

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.220
He's not there yet,

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.460
Percussion's in front,

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.940
but Kaleidoscopio continues to gain.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.300
Percussion... Here comes Kaleidoscopio!

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.260
And he did it! No one can believe it!

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.780
Well, they fucking weren't
supposed to, were they?

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.630
That was the point.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.146
Sit down.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.620
You drink?
I don't remember if you drink.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.140
Of course, there's drink, and drink.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.900
I drink. But I haven't been drunk

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.980
since Reagan was president.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.660
I got a DUI, and in jail

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.181
I actually fell down
and pissed my pants.

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.220
You don't need to do that twice.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.991
I tell you this so you'll know
everybody's been there.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.220
Everybody's been there.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.420
Once.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.740
If you're there twice,

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.181
having been there once,
I can't help you.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:57.941
You know,

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.460
I listen to the drunks

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.620
and it's like
you're listening to a fairy story

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.460
about a fight with a fucking monster

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.180
when the actual title of the story is

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.500
"I Can't Handle My Liquor"
by Mr Crybaby.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.620
- Amen.
- I don't know,

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.660
maybe they got a problem,
but fuck 'em if they do, 'cause I don't.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.180
Which leads me to ask,

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.384
are you pulling this shit
just now, or forever?

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.180
I mean, do you have a problem,

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.340
"Waah-waah-waah,"
like some little fucking girl, or

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.180
some Somali who can't process that

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.223
there's no food where they live?

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.300
Or are you just fucked up temporarily

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.662
'cause you're temporarily
fucking stupid?

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.940
Are you long business or short business?

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.460
What's the difference?

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.860
I need to know if you got the fucking
brains to walk when it's time to walk.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.540
People don't, you know.

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.700
Ballplayers who can't play any more.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.180
Assholes trying to maintain

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.540
a standard of living
not possible any more...

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.424
A lot of those around.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.746
I've seen you be
half a million dollars up.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.742
I've been up
two and a half million dollars.

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.266
What do you got on you?

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.106
Nothing.

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.460
What did you put away?

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.821
Nothing.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.900
You get up
two and a half million dollars,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.220
any asshole in the world
knows what to do.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.460
You get a house with a 25-year roof,

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.980
an indestructible Jap economy shitbox,

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.580
you put the rest into the system

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.220
at 3%-to-5% to pay your taxes,

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.740
and that's your base, get me?

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.060
That's your
Fortress of Fucking Solitude.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.900
That puts you for the rest of your life

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.340
at a level of "fuck you."

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.900
Somebody wants you to
do something? "Fuck you."

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.260
Boss pisses you off? "Fuck you!"

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.420
Own your house,
have a couple bucks in the bank,

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.580
don't drink.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.740
That's all I have to say to
anybody at any social level.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.704
Did your grandfather take risks?

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.260
Yes.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.145
I guarantee he did it
from a position of fuck you.

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:47.060
A wise man's life
is based around fuck you.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.100
The United States of America
is based on fuck you.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.780
You're a king? You have an army?

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.540
Greatest navy in the history
of the world?

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.904
"Fuck you, blow me!
We'll fuck it up ourselves."

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.780
Which we have done.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.020
Beautiful "fuck you"
position lost forever.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:07.144
King George III looks like
a fucking birthday present.

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:12.147
This is the grandson of
the 17th richest man in California.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.380
Does he drink?

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.100
What he wants is money.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.140
Because he doesn't know
when to say, "That's it,

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.260
"I'm two million ahead.
Fuck it. Fuck you.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.700
"I have a car and a house and a family,

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.300
"and it's all paid for, fuck you."

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.309
I mean, even I did that.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.540
Of course, it's out by Pearblossom.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.060
I'll have a beer, just like
anybody else, thank you.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.980
- What kind?
- Any kind.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.581
We got 37 beers.
Don't fucking put it on me.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:38.625
But he did put it on you, miss!

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:44.709
You still owe large
two places you shouldn't.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.463
Why do you want door number three?

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:48.900
How else do I get out?

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.500
Time payments. Sell your sperm.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.021
Sell your ass.
How the fuck should I know?

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.820
I am of the universe,
and you know what it's worth.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.545
It's worth plenty.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:04.061
If I give you this money

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.667
and you don't pay me back,
there are no rules.

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.183
You never get to say
fuck you to anybody ever.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.504
You will get me not just what
you owe me from your family,

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:17.860
you will get me their accounts

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.020
so I can have them vacuumed from Russia.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.180
You jump off a bridge,
you can do it knowing

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.747
I will kill your entire bloodline.

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.300
Do you understand
the gravity of your situation?

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.910
I understand.

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.988
You get up, you get out.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.267
$260,000 as requested.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.541
What's this?

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.862
This much money, what's a car?

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.742
What do you want to
be able to say to me?

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.025
Fuck you.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.504
You have my money?

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.743
I don't have any money.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.503
I want you to stake me.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.302
Stake me, and I'll get your money.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.866
Why did you see Frank?

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.426
I didn't.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.431
Now fucking stake me.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.940
Please, tell me you hit your wife

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.108
harder than that, you fucking pussy.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.551
You got to give me
$150-fucking-thousand.

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.510
What can I do with you?

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.905
Stake me.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.230
Fucking stake me!

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.140
Hey, Lamar, let's go, come on!

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.580
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:59.387
welcome to tonight's
semi-final conference game!

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.785
Put your hands together for your

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.262
Wildcats!

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.020
The Wildcats come into tonight's game
favourites against the Bulldogs,

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:16.791
of course, led by
All-American Lamar Allen.

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.985
Let's go, Wildcats, let's go!

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.860
And as we know, as goes
the play of Lamar Allen

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.220
goes the play of the Wildcats.

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.180
You're talking first team All-American.

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.620
That's the kind of season
Lamar Allen has had.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.302
I expect big things
from this young man tonight.

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:35.107
Let's jump on 'em hard
in the first five minutes!

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.460
Defence, let's smother 'em.
No second chances, okay?

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.100
Let's go, "Wildcats" on three.
One, two, three.

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.460
Wildcats!

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.700
Revenge on the minds and

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.740
tonight the Wildcats looking to show

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.460
the dominance they've had
all season long

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.900
led by that man right there.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.300
That's my boy. Yeah, Lamar!

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.140
- That's your boy?
- That's money, baby!

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.300
- That's the kid?
- That's the kid

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.620
I'm talking about right there.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.460
He knows what he got to do.
The kid is nice!

01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:00.186
The kid is nice! The kid is nice!

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.149
All right. All right now. All right.

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.340
Lamar Allen with a left-handed slam!

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.740
Gets to the basket, throws it down.

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.500
Cats looking
to make something out of this.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.980
He's got Lamar Allen. Turnaround jumper.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.260
Yes, he's got it!

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.580
Lamar Allen throwing down the nasty jam!

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:43.860
Here comes Allen taking it

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.020
up the court on his own.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.222
Throwing it down with
a left-handed slam!

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.340
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
This shit ain't right.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.340
Does well in terms of
looking for his shot.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.384
Lamar Allen throwing down a dunk!

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.260
What is he doing?

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.064
Right now the Wildcats
are in control of this game.

01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.700
There's Allen driving down
the left-hand side,

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.860
and he's got it.

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.700
A little kiss off the glass...

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.980
Man, he better start performing
and less scoring.

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.180
I don't get it. Ain't that your man?

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.906
Yeah, if he don't handle his business,
I'm a handle him.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.540
Here's the Wildcats from the other end,

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.186
Lamar Allen from about 16 feet!
That's not gonna go.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:25.584
Yeah, that's better. That's better.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.060
Come on! Move your ass! Come on!

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.183
Lamar usually makes that shot
in his sleep.

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.220
The Wildcats up by 14

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.700
with a little bit left
to play in this half.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.060
Bulldogs back on of fence,
trying to cut into that Wildcat lead.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.060
Here comes Brodey, right around Allen
for the double-handed slam!

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.900
That's a hell of a crossover by Brodey.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.309
That's more like it.
That's what I'm talking about.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.820
Wildcats up by 12
with nine minutes to go.

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:51.900
That's no effort, Lamar!

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.580
Fast-break situation. Two on one.

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.260
Allen lob to Aldinger!

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.791
What was that?

01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.951
Did you see that?

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.060
Coach also not pleased with what he saw.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.260
Chester Moore checking in
for Lamar Allen.

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.020
Coach not happy,
pulling him out of the game.

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.780
Ironically, not to catch his breath

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.940
but to really, I think,
figure out what is happening.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.100
That's all right. That's all right.
Yeah, Lamar!

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.540
He's blown possession the last four

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.180
times he's touched the ball.
Not what we're used to

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.825
seeing from this kid.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.426
You're going to watch the game
with me. Take a seat.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.420
The bench is the great persuader,

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:25.740
the great teacher.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:29.420
And this is what Coach is doing,
giving Lamar Allen a chance to refocus,

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.740
get his head together.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.900
Started off the game
with spectacular play,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.300
but over these past few minutes,

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:37.420
has not been the Lamar Allen
that we're used to seeing.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.304
Stay on that bench, Lamar.

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.460
What the hell's wrong with you, Lamar?

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.300
Here comes the Dogs back on of fence.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.820
He's got Cunningham.

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.624
Cunningham finds Wilhelm in the paint!

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:56.940
And a foul!

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.824
Take it to the house, motherfucker.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.302
Yeah, okay, we good, we good.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.027
There you go.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.780
Look at his face.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.028
This is humiliating for Lamar Allen...

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.820
in the conference semi-finals

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:13.545
against their rivals.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:23.382
Bulldogs now have
the lead for the first time!

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.628
And here comes Lamar Allen.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.460
Stay on the bench, Lamar. Stay
on that fucking bench, Lamar!

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.071
Stay on the fucking bench!

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.070
Lamar!

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.140
Bulldogs score again!

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.229
They now have a three-point lead.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.500
The fans purring Allen's name,

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.589
looking for him to do something.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.820
Here comes Allen
on the left-handed drive!

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.340
He's got it.

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.746
Come on!

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.070
What this motherfucker just do?

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.427
Under two minutes to go in the game.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:02.060
Here's Lamar Allen looking to
make some magic. Goes around.

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:05.582
Splits the defence! Throws it
down with a left-handed jam!

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:10.540
Wildcats have the lead now, 64-63,

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.460
and Allen with another turnaround.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:15.060
It is in! Lamar Allen singlehandedly

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.342
going on a 6-0 run!

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.980
Under a minute to go.
Allen throws it down again!

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:25.140
Wildcats up by 5. This has
been the Lamar Allen show

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.024
in these final minutes.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.420
Bulldogs miss the lay-up.
Allen's got the rebound.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.580
Oh, come on!

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.060
He's on fire!

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.260
He's fucking up like that.

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.700
He knows what he supposed to be doing.

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.540
You say that's your man. He's scoring.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.100
Yeah, too damn much!

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.860
But that's not what Lamar Allen does.

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.303
Takes it around and to the hole!
Cats up by seven.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.380
Come on, man. This some bullshit!

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.105
I told him less than 8.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.540
Right now, Lamar Allen

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.060
is playing the game of basketball

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.991
at the highest level one can play it.

01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:59.786
Ten...

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:01.900
Nine, eight,

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.387
seven, six, five,

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:08.142
four, three, two, one.

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.504
Yes, sir!

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.106
Yes, sir!

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:57.030
Our boy delivered.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.950
You delivered.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:02.145
You know how rare that is?
A man delivers?

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.100
So we square?

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.507
You going to stop threatening the girl?

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:08.300
How about I tell you, you get to keep

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:11.026
your job at the university? Forever.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.780
Just so long as you keep
teaching English 101

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.789
to a whole lot of tall brothers.

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.388
Oh, I'd tell you to kill me.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.550
Have a drink.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.191
Don't want one.

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.460
Thanks, sweetheart.

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.820
I see the Koreans fucked your face up.

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.306
Yes, they did.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:37.180
And you just move on
to the next phase of bullshit.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:40.620
You know,

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:42.868
the only trouble is with the game today?

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.540
What's that?

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.460
Someone also bet
an eight-point spread in Vegas

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:50.061
for a whole lot of fucking money.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.022
You wouldn't happen to know
who did that, would ya?

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.585
No idea.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.583
You ain't tipped nobody?

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.546
No.

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.588
What's your life's plan, Jim?

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:17.341
Make part of it never seeing me again.

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.900
I don't need you no more, brother.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.500
I know that.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.862
Think I want you out there knowing that?

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:25.545
Knowing this?

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.100
I'm going to tell you that
I'm not going to do you

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:31.224
the discourtesy of assuming
what you're thinking,

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.942
but I know you'll do the right thing.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.905
Why is that?

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.268
That's the whole amount.

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:45.630
And points.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.505
Where'd you get that?

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.580
I borrowed it from Frank.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.111
The fuck you did.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.900
- Ask him.
- I will.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.148
Then you will find out that I did.

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:20.505
You know, Jim,
everybody's ready to be bent.

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.869
Some are ready to be straight.

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:28.026
Personally, I'm ready to be straight.

01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:36.151
I'm going to get myself an avocado farm.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.985
Or a winery.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.023
Do what I got to do, you know?

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.621
Not a huge fan of low company.

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.301
A man can transform his shit, Jim.

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.700
You know, I've never done
anything like this before.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.706
I mean, I didn't think I was going
to make it out of there alive, you know.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.261
Open it.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.222
Take out 50 grand, that's yours.

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.500
Man, I'm going to have
my fucking picture

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.782
on a Wheaties box within months, dude.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.425
Suit yourself.

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.427
What was the point of me going to Vegas?

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:13.427
Obviously it wasn't to earn 50 grand.

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:16.704
Time to get away from me, Dexter.
Far away.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.900
I got your money.
But I'm not coming there.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.100
You got to meet me.

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.900
Koreatown. You know the place, right?

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.380
Everybody knows the place.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:36.220
Whether or not
I want you around that place

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:39.060
with my money in your hand
is another fucking story.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.945
Well, that's the only place
I'll meet you.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.141
You have all my money, plus everything?

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.260
Yeah, I have all your money,

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.111
but I don't have everything.
You got to meet me there.

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.900
What do you do when you're
in the "fuck you" position?

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.220
Oh, we've had that discussion,
and I understand your point,

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.467
but you got to meet me there.

01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:59.300
If there's a list of places
where nobody gets ripped off,

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.662
I believe that's at the top.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:13.546
- You have my money?
- Yes.

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.345
Then you must come outside.

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.341
No.

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.464
I owe him, too.

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.420
You gonna play?

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.980
It's the only way I could pay you both.

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.500
You can't take the money off me
in here and neither can he.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.340
Red or black, all or nothing,
all the money down.

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.701
That's all I'll do.

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:35.061
Move.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.180
Take a very sizable bet?

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.223
That is what this room is for.

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.500
- What the fuck are you doing?
- No!

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:52.747
Fuck are you doing?

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.430
All on black.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:40.620
I was playing for Mister Lee
and for that gentleman over there.

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:46.788
I'm not actually a gambler.

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.660
Keys are in the car.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.305
You don't need a ride?

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:20.224
No, I'll walk. I feel like walking.

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.865
What do you got on you?

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:23.580
Not a fucking cent.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:25.544
That's not a "fuck you" position.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.100
Oh, yes, it is.

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.500
Here's your $100,000.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.020
Turns out there was
a little extra cream on top.

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.540
On me.

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:34.026
Fuck you.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.580
Good boy.
