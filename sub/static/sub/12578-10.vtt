when this is the only gift on the block
that'll work.

13:42.509 --> 13:46.138
And when that grid goes down,
you know what's gonna happen?

13:46.247 --> 13:50.149
-l don't know what a grid is.
-Exactly. Nobody does.

13:50.251 --> 13:52.481
And they certainly won't know
what time it is.

13:52.586 --> 13:56.488
And that's when they'll be knocking
on our door, asking to use our clock.
