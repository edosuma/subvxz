<b>6x06 - "The Rise of Clovis"</b>

00:22.558 --> 00:24.768
<i> War profiteers!</i>

00:24.810 --> 00:28.939
<i>In time of war, credits are the fuel
that fund all operations.</i>

00:28.981 --> 00:31.984
<i>Senator Amidala is sent to Scipio</i>

00:32.026 --> 00:33.903
<i>to resolve matters between the Republic</i>

00:33.944 --> 00:35.946
<i>and the InterGalactic Banking Clan.</i>

00:35.988 --> 00:38.115
<i>Here she is reunited with Rush Clovis,</i>

00:38.157 --> 00:39.658
<i>a once-close friend,</i>

00:39.700 --> 00:41.827
<i>but now a known traitor
to the Republic.</i>

00:41.869 --> 00:45.288
<i>When Clovis reveals corruption
at the core of the Banking Clan,</i>

00:45.330 --> 00:48.375
<i>Senator Amidala
helps him steal vital files</i>

00:48.417 --> 00:51.212
<i>that may uncover
the full extent of the plot.</i>

00:51.252 --> 00:53.923
<i>Anakin Skywalker is sent
to rescue the Senator</i>

00:53.964 --> 00:56.550
<i>and escort the information
back to Coruscant,</i>

00:56.592 --> 00:59.845
<i>leaving the Banking Clan in chaos.</i>

01:05.601 --> 01:08.520
The Jedi Anakin Skywalker
should never have been allowed

01:08.562 --> 01:11.565
to leave with the Senator in tow.

01:11.607 --> 01:13.150
Any future disruptions

01:13.192 --> 01:16.946
will be placed upon
your shoulders, Nix Card.

01:16.987 --> 01:19.073
As you wish.

01:19.115 --> 01:21.658
Sir, we have confirmed
that Rush Clovis

01:21.700 --> 01:23.284
was on the Jedi ship.

01:23.326 --> 01:25.996
Then there's nothing we can do.

01:26.038 --> 01:27.998
But they have the files.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.209
Unfortunate, yes,

01:30.251 --> 01:33.212
but they need more than just files
to incriminate us.

01:33.254 --> 01:36.339
That will only take them time.

01:36.381 --> 01:38.050
We will all be destroyed.

01:38.092 --> 01:40.970
We must remain calm.

01:41.011 --> 01:43.388
The only way they could find
our secret accounts

01:43.430 --> 01:45.599
is if one of us told them.

01:45.641 --> 01:48.102
I want it noted
that you and you alone

01:48.144 --> 01:49.561
allowed this to happen,

01:49.603 --> 01:53.398
and that it has put us all at risk.

02:13.418 --> 02:14.377
You're late.

02:14.419 --> 02:16.046
What news?

02:16.088 --> 02:19.633
Clovis, the Senator,
and the Jedi are on their way.

02:19.675 --> 02:21.677
With the information?

02:21.718 --> 02:22.886
Enough.

02:22.928 --> 02:24.387
Good.

02:24.429 --> 02:26.723
Then we can continue to the next stage

02:26.765 --> 02:28.934
of the proceedings.

02:28.976 --> 02:30.894
And what about me?

02:30.936 --> 02:35.607
You will be protected, I can assure you.

03:15.522 --> 03:17.274
Master Yoda.

03:17.316 --> 03:19.860
We weren't expecting
such a formal welcome, Master.

03:19.902 --> 03:22.279
A personal request
of the Chancellor's,

03:22.321 --> 03:23.906
my escorting you was, Senator.

03:23.947 --> 03:27.117
Adventures, have you had,
on Scipio, hmm?

03:27.159 --> 03:29.370
Have you met Rush Clovis?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.580
Met, we have, yes.

03:31.621 --> 03:34.583
Intrigued, we are,
by your return to Coruscant.

03:34.624 --> 03:37.460
Much distrust
is focused upon you.

03:37.502 --> 03:39.088
I understand,

03:39.129 --> 03:42.132
but I hope to right the wrongs
that I have done.

03:42.174 --> 03:45.344
Delay, we must not.

03:50.015 --> 03:53.435
Excuse me if I find it hard
to trust you, Clovis.

03:53.476 --> 03:54.978
You used to sit
on this very Senate

03:55.020 --> 03:56.272
even as you funneled credits

03:56.313 --> 03:58.732
into the droid foundries
of Count Dooku.

03:58.774 --> 04:01.110
I understand
all of your trepidation,

04:01.151 --> 04:03.153
but there is corruption
in the banks.

04:03.195 --> 04:05.697
And once we find
this corruption?

04:05.739 --> 04:08.575
I believe the ones responsible
should be ousted from control

04:08.617 --> 04:11.287
before the entire banking
infrastructure collapses.

04:11.328 --> 04:13.538
Oh, and I suppose
you're the man to do it.

04:13.580 --> 04:17.084
I only want the Banking Clan
to be what it once was:

04:17.125 --> 04:19.753
a fair system
of trade and commerce.

04:19.795 --> 04:21.964
I came here
to root out the criminals

04:22.005 --> 04:23.966
and reveal the truth
behind what is happening.

04:24.007 --> 04:25.301
Now, now.

04:25.342 --> 04:29.346
We are grateful for you bringing us
this information,

04:29.388 --> 04:32.099
but what exactly can you prove?

04:32.141 --> 04:36.040
These files show that huge
funds have been diverted out

04:36.041 --> 04:39.940
of the banks and into what I
believe are private accounts.

04:39.982 --> 04:42.484
And the veracity of this information?

04:42.525 --> 04:44.486
I was the one
who downloaded the files

04:44.527 --> 04:47.281
from the Muun's secure mainframe.

04:47.323 --> 04:49.825
I believe that what Clovis
is saying is correct.

04:49.866 --> 04:52.244
Then, Senator Amidala,

04:52.286 --> 04:55.705
I would like you
to spearhead this investigation.

04:55.747 --> 04:57.791
Work closely with Rush Clovis,

04:57.833 --> 05:01.253
and find and expose
these secret accounts.

05:01.295 --> 05:05.132
Once we know exactly
what we are dealing with,

05:05.174 --> 05:09.345
then we can decide
how best to handle this...

05:09.386 --> 05:11.596
situation.

05:22.316 --> 05:23.817
Why didn't you just say no?

05:23.859 --> 05:25.986
Say no?
Why?

05:26.028 --> 05:28.989
I don't want you working with Clovis.

05:29.031 --> 05:31.408
You don't want me working with him?

05:31.450 --> 05:33.785
A serpent can shed its skin,

05:33.827 --> 05:35.536
but it is still a serpent.

05:35.578 --> 05:37.206
Well, you're just
going to have to trust

05:37.247 --> 05:38.748
my judgment here.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.209
Like the last time, hmm?

05:40.250 --> 05:41.960
When you almost ended up dead?

05:42.002 --> 05:43.544
Or how about
you just getting arrested,

05:43.586 --> 05:45.088
and it was me
who had to bail you out?

05:45.130 --> 05:48.342
The Chancellor has asked me
to do this, Anakin.

05:48.384 --> 05:51.887
But I'm asking you
to say no.

05:51.928 --> 05:54.097
As your husband, I demand

05:54.139 --> 05:56.599
that you tell the Chancellor
you are stepping down.

05:56.641 --> 05:58.143
Demand?

05:58.185 --> 05:59.686
We've been over this before.

05:59.728 --> 06:01.604
I'm not foolish enough to allow myself

06:01.646 --> 06:03.940
to be deceived twice, Anakin.

06:03.982 --> 06:07.652
My sole intentions
are to defend the Republic.

06:07.694 --> 06:09.071
If you can't trust me...

06:09.112 --> 06:11.740
Uh, excuse the interruption.

06:11.781 --> 06:13.700
PadmÃ©, shall we begin?

06:13.742 --> 06:16.537
Yes, of course.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.663
General Skywalker.

06:37.182 --> 06:41.478
Darth Tyranus,
it is time for you once again

06:41.520 --> 06:44.856
to recruit our friend Clovis.

06:44.898 --> 06:48.818
He appears to have lost his way.

06:48.860 --> 06:51.154
And how would you like me
to do that?

06:51.196 --> 06:55.158
We're going to help him
take over the Banking Clan.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.827
But first, you must entrap him

06:57.869 --> 07:02.749
so he has no one else
to turn to.

07:02.791 --> 07:04.709
Of course, my lord.

07:04.751 --> 07:05.919
As you wish.

07:14.761 --> 07:16.763
I have been looking for you.

07:16.805 --> 07:18.056
Something wrong?

07:18.098 --> 07:20.392
You tell me.

07:20.434 --> 07:21.893
Not that I'm aware.

07:21.935 --> 07:24.396
Master Yoda feels that your judgments

07:24.438 --> 07:27.190
concerning Rush Clovis are clouded.

07:29.151 --> 07:31.528
Mm, I believe he can't be trusted.

07:31.570 --> 07:33.947
Yes, but there is more, isn't there?

07:33.989 --> 07:37.659
I sense a deep anger in you
by my simply saying his name.

07:37.700 --> 07:40.078
He almost got Senator Amidala killed,

07:40.120 --> 07:42.038
and I would have been responsible.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.791
The Senator has risked
her life many times.

07:44.833 --> 07:47.252
She's quite capable
of taking care of herself.

07:47.294 --> 07:48.962
They had a relationship...

07:49.004 --> 07:50.380
once.

07:50.422 --> 07:54.050
I simply feel she is vulnerable
to her emotions.

07:54.092 --> 07:55.844
She is...

07:55.885 --> 07:56.886
or you?

07:56.928 --> 07:59.097
What are you implying?

07:59.139 --> 08:03.602
Anakin, I understand to a degree
what is going on.

08:03.644 --> 08:04.978
You've met Satine.

08:05.020 --> 08:07.772
You know I once
harbored feelings for her.

08:07.814 --> 08:09.691
It's not that we're not allowed
to have these feelings.

08:09.732 --> 08:11.151
It's natural.

08:11.193 --> 08:14.904
Senator Amidala and I
are simply friends.

08:14.946 --> 08:16.990
And friends you must remain.

08:17.032 --> 08:18.492
As a Jedi, it is essential

08:18.534 --> 08:20.494
you make the right choice, Anakin,

08:20.536 --> 08:22.663
for the Order.

08:22.704 --> 08:26.458
I understand my responsibilities.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.793
Responsibilities
that must be observed

08:28.835 --> 08:30.587
whatever relationship develops

08:30.629 --> 08:32.589
between Clovis
and Senator Amidala.

08:32.631 --> 08:35.258
They have no relationship.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.678
It is simply business
between them.

08:37.719 --> 08:40.389
Then we should have
no problems,

08:40.429 --> 08:41.515
should we?

09:02.661 --> 09:04.454
The opera was wonderful,

09:04.496 --> 09:08.208
but I'm glad we can
we can get down to business.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.792
If you look here,

09:09.834 --> 09:11.169
the Separatists haven't been

09:11.211 --> 09:12.504
repaying any interest
on their loans.

09:12.546 --> 09:14.130
But still, the Banking Clan
is promising

09:14.172 --> 09:16.132
to lend credits
to the Republic,

09:16.174 --> 09:17.967
credits they simply don't have.

09:18.009 --> 09:20.095
But where have all
the savings gone?

09:20.136 --> 09:21.763
Each of the files
that you downloaded

09:21.804 --> 09:24.307
shows hundreds and hundreds
of small withdrawals,

09:24.349 --> 09:27.185
small enough to remain
undetected individually,

09:27.227 --> 09:30.772
but as a sum total,

09:30.813 --> 09:33.275
a devastating theft.

09:33.316 --> 09:34.901
Whoever is behind this
is no fool.

09:34.943 --> 09:36.986
We need to find out
who's benefiting.

09:37.028 --> 09:40.323
We're still lacking
a critical piece of information.

09:42.909 --> 09:46.788
Whatever we find must remain
between only you and I.

09:46.829 --> 09:48.624
This would be
highly dangerous information

09:48.665 --> 09:50.459
should it get
into the wrong hands.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.210
Of course.

09:53.253 --> 09:54.546
This reminds me,

09:54.588 --> 09:56.172
when we had three nights
to prepare

09:56.214 --> 09:57.549
for the Senate hearing
to rescue

09:57.591 --> 09:59.801
Bromlarch's planetary
aqueduct system.

10:01.637 --> 10:04.806
And together, we saved a people
from total drought and famine.

10:04.847 --> 10:08.184
I don't think either of us
got any sleep that whole week,

10:08.226 --> 10:09.686
let alone ate anything.

10:11.187 --> 10:13.856
We're not as young as we used to be.

10:13.898 --> 10:16.693
Well, we're not that old either.

10:16.735 --> 10:18.612
You might be right.

10:18.654 --> 10:22.991
Perhaps we should eat something.

10:23.032 --> 10:27.912
So, Clovis, why have you gotten
so involved with the Muuns?

10:27.954 --> 10:29.539
I believe in the banks.

10:29.581 --> 10:30.666
The system works.

10:30.707 --> 10:32.501
The Muuns aren't bad people.

10:32.542 --> 10:34.586
It's just a dishonest few
who are destroying everything

10:34.628 --> 10:36.379
for their own gain.

10:36.421 --> 10:38.799
You know, you've never told me
how you rose to such heights

10:38.840 --> 10:40.509
within the Banking Clan.

10:40.550 --> 10:42.803
It's not a happy story.

10:42.844 --> 10:45.514
My father was a personal attachÃ©
to the household

10:45.555 --> 10:47.307
of one of the head
Muun families.

10:47.349 --> 10:49.434
We were basically servants.

10:49.476 --> 10:51.728
I had no idea.

10:51.770 --> 10:53.980
As I grew up,
the head of the family

10:54.022 --> 10:56.899
took a personal interest
in my education.

10:56.941 --> 10:58.527
I was the same age as his children,

10:58.568 --> 11:01.196
and so we all studied together.

11:01.237 --> 11:03.573
When my parents
and his wife were killed

11:03.615 --> 11:05.200
in a shuttle accident,

11:05.241 --> 11:06.576
he adopted me.

11:06.618 --> 11:07.786
How old were you?

11:09.371 --> 11:11.665
That must have been very hard.

11:11.707 --> 11:15.084
I was accepted as their child
everywhere we went.

11:15.126 --> 11:17.170
I almost forgot
where I was from,

11:17.212 --> 11:18.714
until I looked in the mirror.

11:18.755 --> 11:20.799
They sound like good people.

11:20.841 --> 11:22.592
They are.

11:22.634 --> 11:23.926
Most Muuns are.

11:23.968 --> 11:26.012
And they want
this corruption ended

11:26.054 --> 11:27.305
more than I do.

11:27.347 --> 11:28.849
You should know my contacts

11:28.889 --> 11:30.684
within the Muun government
run deep.

11:30.726 --> 11:33.729
I have many allies,
should I need to call on them.

11:33.770 --> 11:37.232
I didn't appreciate
how personal this was for you.

11:37.273 --> 11:38.692
Now maybe you will trust me.

11:39.942 --> 11:41.528
I'm here, aren't I?

11:41.570 --> 11:42.903
I want to thank you

11:42.945 --> 11:44.865
for everything
you've done for me.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.158
I don't think I would have had
the strength alone.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.369
Clovis, don't.

11:49.411 --> 11:51.329
It's that Jedi, isn't it?

11:51.371 --> 11:53.206
General Skywalker?

11:53.248 --> 11:55.291
We're friends, nothing more.

11:55.333 --> 11:59.128
Friends don't argue
the way I saw you arguing today.

11:59.170 --> 12:01.047
You're confused.

12:01.089 --> 12:03.592
Isn't it forbidden for a Jedi
to have romantic ties?

12:03.633 --> 12:06.135
He would be banished
from the Order, would he not?

12:06.177 --> 12:08.971
There is nothing romantic
between he and I.

12:09.013 --> 12:11.767
Then there is absolutely nothing
to stop us from doing this.

12:11.808 --> 12:12.768
Clovis!

12:12.809 --> 12:15.562
Clovis, no.

12:15.604 --> 12:18.690
Get away from her!

12:22.943 --> 12:25.697
Anakin, no!

12:27.198 --> 12:30.159
Why don't you try fighting like
a man without your Jedi tricks?

12:30.201 --> 12:33.872
Oh, it would be my pleasure.

12:37.542 --> 12:38.710
Both of you stop this!

12:38.752 --> 12:41.671
You don't have a say in this!

12:43.339 --> 12:45.383
I thought you said
he didn't have feelings for you.

12:49.345 --> 12:52.641
I see you for what you truly are!

12:58.271 --> 13:00.816
Anakin: You're a serpent, a traitor!

13:03.944 --> 13:05.194
Please, stop this!

13:05.236 --> 13:06.195
No!

13:07.697 --> 13:10.241
Is that all you got?

13:10.283 --> 13:12.243
You should accept
that the Senator

13:12.285 --> 13:13.912
has other interests than you.

13:23.296 --> 13:25.173
Ah, Skywalker, you fool.

13:26.382 --> 13:28.134
Stop it.
Anakin, stop!

13:28.176 --> 13:30.386
What are you doing?

13:33.849 --> 13:35.266
I'm sorry.

13:35.308 --> 13:37.519
<i>Senator Amidala,
is everything okay in there?</i>

13:37.560 --> 13:40.605
No.
Come in immediately.

13:40.647 --> 13:42.190
What has happened here?

13:43.942 --> 13:45.694
There was an attack.

13:45.735 --> 13:48.905
It was my good fortune
to have General Skywalker here.

13:48.947 --> 13:50.907
They escaped in a speeder
over the balcony.

13:50.949 --> 13:53.910
Is that what happened, sir?

13:53.952 --> 13:58.038
If that's what the man says.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.500
A medic droid is on its way.

14:00.542 --> 14:03.211
Please, help Clovis
into the bedroom.

14:08.257 --> 14:12.012
- PadmÃ©, I'm...
- Stay away from me.

14:30.655 --> 14:32.574
How is he?

14:32.615 --> 14:34.576
Nothing that won't heal.

14:34.617 --> 14:35.660
I'm so sorry, PadmÃ©.

14:35.702 --> 14:39.080
I don't know what came over me.

14:39.121 --> 14:42.333
What's done is done.

14:42.375 --> 14:45.211
It's just, when I saw you
about to kiss him...

14:45.253 --> 14:46.254
And I regret that,

14:46.295 --> 14:48.172
but it was not what you thought.

14:48.214 --> 14:51.760
And you must know,
I don't care for Clovis.

14:51.801 --> 14:53.177
Don't you?

14:53.219 --> 14:55.388
I've told you
why I'm doing this,

14:55.430 --> 14:58.391
but still,
you refuse to accept it.

14:58.433 --> 15:00.810
You could have
killed him, Anakin.

15:00.852 --> 15:02.186
I know.

15:02.228 --> 15:05.065
This marriage
is not a marriage, Anakin,

15:05.106 --> 15:07.316
if there isn't any trust.

15:07.358 --> 15:08.985
We said at the beginning

15:09.027 --> 15:10.987
that this could be
a terrible mistake.

15:11.029 --> 15:13.197
What exactly
are you saying?

15:13.239 --> 15:15.199
That other people
who are married

15:15.241 --> 15:16.910
have everything that we don't,

15:16.952 --> 15:18.870
everything that we won't.

15:18.912 --> 15:20.663
We live in secret, Anakin.

15:20.705 --> 15:22.331
Like it or not,

15:22.373 --> 15:25.501
our relationship is built
on lies and deception.

15:25.543 --> 15:27.670
No relationship
can survive that.

15:27.712 --> 15:29.089
I know I went too far.

15:29.130 --> 15:30.673
It's just...

15:30.715 --> 15:33.093
It's just something
inside me snapped.

15:33.134 --> 15:35.887
I don't know
who's in there sometimes.

15:35.929 --> 15:38.347
I just know
that I'm not happy anymore.

15:38.389 --> 15:39.975
I don't feel safe.

15:40.016 --> 15:42.060
But, PadmÃ©...

15:42.102 --> 15:45.438
I think it's best if we don't
see each other anymore,

15:45.480 --> 15:47.273
at least not for a while.

15:47.315 --> 15:49.525
I'm sorry, Anakin.

15:49.567 --> 15:51.111
I'm...

15:51.152 --> 15:52.487
I'm sorry too.

15:55.197 --> 15:58.534
Everything all right, Senator?

15:58.576 --> 16:00.787
No.

16:21.099 --> 16:23.476
Nothing appears to be broken,

16:23.518 --> 16:26.729
but more importantly,
someone wants to speak with you.

16:26.771 --> 16:28.731
What are you talking about?

16:28.773 --> 16:31.484
I am a servant
of Count Dooku.

16:35.947 --> 16:37.991
Hello, Clovis.

16:38.033 --> 16:39.450
What do you want, Dooku?

16:39.492 --> 16:41.285
It appears
we have a mutual problem

16:41.327 --> 16:43.872
that I would like to fix.

16:43.913 --> 16:45.456
I know the Separatists

16:45.498 --> 16:47.792
have not been repaying
their loans to the banks.

16:47.834 --> 16:51.046
Now, why would we
support corruption?

16:51.087 --> 16:52.588
You expect me to believe
that Lesser and his associates

16:52.630 --> 16:54.256
have no ties with you?

16:54.298 --> 16:56.676
They've allowed you
to borrow credits

16:56.718 --> 16:58.386
and not pay any interest.

16:58.427 --> 17:00.096
What you say is correct,

17:00.138 --> 17:02.724
but that information,
if made public,

17:02.765 --> 17:04.474
will only bring war to Scipio,

17:04.517 --> 17:06.060
and the banks will fall.

17:06.102 --> 17:07.770
Nobody wants that.

17:07.811 --> 17:10.314
So in the interests of all,

17:10.356 --> 17:13.442
I suggest we come
to some arrangement.

17:13.483 --> 17:14.861
What are you saying?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.905
That the banks
need new management,

17:16.945 --> 17:20.782
and that it could be you.

17:20.825 --> 17:23.368
That I would like help...

17:23.411 --> 17:26.122
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were afraid.

17:26.164 --> 17:29.000
I prefer the term "careful."

17:29.042 --> 17:32.336
These are delicate matters.

17:32.378 --> 17:35.048
We need funds,
just as the Republic does

17:35.090 --> 17:36.841
to pay for this war.

17:36.883 --> 17:39.427
<i>I can give you the location
of the secret accounts</i>

17:39.468 --> 17:40.803
you are searching for

17:40.845 --> 17:42.722
so you can plead your case
to the Senate.

17:42.764 --> 17:44.599
And you won't stand
in my way?

17:44.640 --> 17:48.061
We'll even start paying
the interest on our loans

17:48.103 --> 17:51.397
to show the Republic
our full endorsement.

17:51.439 --> 17:53.691
What do you get out of this?

17:53.733 --> 17:57.319
Stability in unstable times.

17:57.361 --> 18:00.615
The location of the accounts
are on this disc.

18:05.578 --> 18:08.998
Now, where were we?

18:13.920 --> 18:16.338
The Muun government
has seized the accounts

18:16.380 --> 18:18.925
and arrested the heads
of the Banking Clan.

18:18.967 --> 18:23.387
We are indebted to Rush Clovis
for his service to our people.

18:23.429 --> 18:26.432
Well, I have done only
what I thought was right.

18:26.474 --> 18:27.850
Considering the information,

18:27.892 --> 18:29.978
it appears
that the Separatist government

18:30.019 --> 18:31.271
has agreed to allow you

18:31.312 --> 18:33.689
to be the new head
of the banks.

18:33.731 --> 18:35.316
And the Republic?

18:35.357 --> 18:38.694
I can only give you
my endorsement.

18:38.736 --> 18:41.990
Now all that stands
in your way is the Senate.

18:47.162 --> 18:48.246
Order.

18:48.288 --> 18:50.456
Order!

18:52.834 --> 18:53.918
Good luck.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.377
Thank you.

18:55.419 --> 18:58.089
Rush Clovis
will now address the Senate.

18:59.132 --> 19:01.759
Traitor!

19:01.801 --> 19:04.637
<i>Clovis?</i>

19:04.679 --> 19:08.183
I come to you today
with irrefutable evidence

19:08.224 --> 19:10.310
that the heads
of the Banking Clan

19:10.351 --> 19:11.727
have been stealing funds,

19:11.769 --> 19:14.772
and have virtually
bankrupted the system.

19:17.525 --> 19:20.820
I know the Muuns
to be a good and honest people,

19:20.862 --> 19:24.448
and that it is the actions
of only these unscrupulous few

19:24.490 --> 19:25.950
who are responsible.

19:25.992 --> 19:28.286
I humbly ask you
for your nomination

19:28.328 --> 19:29.662
in taking over the banks.

19:29.704 --> 19:31.080
<i>What can you do?</i>

19:31.122 --> 19:33.624
I will restore order
and return the banks

19:33.666 --> 19:37.795
back to secure and mutual
negotiations and transactions.

19:37.837 --> 19:38.921
How can we trust you?

19:38.963 --> 19:40.965
I vow to be impartial

19:41.007 --> 19:44.093
and show no favor
to either side in this war.

19:44.135 --> 19:47.388
But you have colluded
with the Separatists.

19:47.429 --> 19:49.431
It is the Separatist ties
to Rush Clovis

19:49.473 --> 19:52.434
that has allowed them
to accept this nomination.

19:52.476 --> 19:56.731
He also has the full support
of the Muun people.

19:56.772 --> 19:59.317
And what of the Chancellor?

19:59.359 --> 20:03.196
I believe that in
these dangerous times,

20:03.238 --> 20:06.448
the bank must be protected
at all costs

20:06.490 --> 20:09.911
and that a man who has
no allegiance to either side,

20:09.952 --> 20:12.621
and the support
of the Muun people,

20:12.663 --> 20:14.374
is our best hope.

20:14.415 --> 20:18.002
Then we shall put it
to a vote.

20:28.346 --> 20:32.600
A resounding majority
in support of the nomination.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.414
My boy, I can tell
this has been a difficult time.

20:54.455 --> 20:55.790
I've known you too long

20:55.831 --> 20:57.750
not to see something
is troubling you.

20:58.834 --> 21:00.586
Your Excellency, forgive me,

21:00.628 --> 21:04.132
but you have made a mistake
by trusting Clovis.

21:04.173 --> 21:05.591
Have I?

21:05.633 --> 21:08.970
Rest assured,
my public endorsement of Clovis

21:09.011 --> 21:13.057
is not the same
as my private confidence in him.

21:13.099 --> 21:15.268
Then what exactly
is going on here?

21:15.310 --> 21:17.812
We will watch him closely.

21:17.853 --> 21:20.481
I don't dispute
your distrust of him.

21:20.522 --> 21:23.776
I think there is something
we haven't unearthed yet,

21:23.818 --> 21:27.155
and I would very much like
for it to surface.

21:27.196 --> 21:28.864
But people have been hurt...

21:28.906 --> 21:31.533
could be hurt
in the process.

21:31.575 --> 21:34.620
Let us make sure
that doesn't happen.

21:34.662 --> 21:36.956
Shall we?
