WEBVTT

00:00.484 --> 00:02.918
Of Oak Island...

00:03.020 --> 00:05.654
We found the location
of the 90-foot stone.

00:05.790 --> 00:07.356
The stone that was brought up

00:07.458 --> 00:09.218
from the Money Pit with
an inscription on it.

00:09.293 --> 00:11.060
This is it,
right straight ahead.

00:11.128 --> 00:13.368
- It's like a maze down here.
- Jeez, look at this place.

00:13.464 --> 00:14.663
Come take a look at this!

00:14.765 --> 00:16.076
- What you got here?
- It's a big stone.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.266
Well, look at that!

00:17.334 --> 00:18.133
Here they come.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.702
Today is when it begins.

00:19.804 --> 00:21.303
We're gonna dig a big hole

00:21.405 --> 00:22.516
in the Money Pit and find out
what's there.

00:22.540 --> 00:23.972
Right, brother?

00:24.075 --> 00:25.974
- Absolutely.
- It's go time.

00:26.077 --> 00:27.443
Here we go. Make hole.

00:31.115 --> 00:35.250
<i>There is an island in
the North Atlantic where people</i>

00:35.352 --> 00:37.653
<i>have been looking for
an incredible treasure</i>

00:37.755 --> 00:40.989
<i>for more than 200 years.</i>

00:41.092 --> 00:44.660
<i>So far they have found bits
of gold chain,</i>

00:44.729 --> 00:48.731
<i>a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it,</i>

00:48.833 --> 00:52.601
<i>even a 17th Century
Spanish coin.</i>

00:52.703 --> 00:56.605
<i>To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.</i>

00:57.808 --> 01:00.042
<i>And, according to legend</i>

01:00.144 --> 01:03.011
<i>one more will have to die,</i>

01:03.114 --> 01:06.048
<i>before the treasure
can be found.</i>

01:17.528 --> 01:19.661
Here they come!

01:19.764 --> 01:22.231
- Big truck.
- Big truck!

01:22.333 --> 01:24.600
Once they pass that gate,

01:24.702 --> 01:26.268
it's begun.

01:26.370 --> 01:28.036
It's an historic day.

01:28.139 --> 01:30.205
Time to dig in the Money Pit.

01:31.609 --> 01:34.143
<i>For brothers, Rick
and Marty Lagina,</i>

01:34.245 --> 01:37.212
<i>today marks the beginning
of a culmination</i>

01:37.314 --> 01:40.215
<i>of more than a decade
of research,</i>

01:40.317 --> 01:43.719
<i>data collection,
and painstaking hard work.</i>

01:43.821 --> 01:45.554
- Andrew!
- Good morning, Marty.

01:45.656 --> 01:47.489
- How are you?
- Welcome back to Oak Island.

01:47.591 --> 01:48.602
- How do you do, sir?
- This is Mike Turnbull.

01:48.626 --> 01:49.746
This is our general manager.

01:49.794 --> 01:51.193
Mike, nice
to meet you. I'm Marty.

01:51.295 --> 01:52.539
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

01:52.563 --> 01:54.396
Got us some bits
and pieces here?

01:54.498 --> 01:56.665
- Yes.
- How many loads we got total?

01:56.767 --> 01:58.734
Today, probably in
and around fifteen.

01:58.836 --> 02:01.069
- Then how many more loads?
- Twenty-five.

02:01.172 --> 02:02.571
Yeah.

02:02.673 --> 02:04.406
So the site back there
looks big now

02:04.508 --> 02:05.974
but it's gonna get small
real quick.

02:06.076 --> 02:07.409
We're gonna dig a big hole

02:07.511 --> 02:09.277
in the Money Pit and find out
what's there.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.380
That's what we're gonna do.
Right, Brother?

02:11.482 --> 02:12.482
Absolutely.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.685
Today, is when it begins.

02:16.787 --> 02:18.587
This huge gear is coming in,

02:18.689 --> 02:23.125
on multiple low float rigs
to get this process started.

02:23.194 --> 02:27.396
And it's very sobering because
it's a commitment of our time,

02:27.498 --> 02:29.631
our money and our energy.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.935
We're focused on
the Money Pit dig.

02:33.037 --> 02:36.572
We are bringing high tech gear
for the sole purpose

02:36.674 --> 02:40.976
of trying to figure out
the mystery of Oak Island.

02:41.078 --> 02:45.047
If there ever
was the right spot to dig,

02:45.149 --> 02:47.983
I think we're digging it,
in the Money Pit.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.352
So, you know, I mean,
I-I can't wait.

02:50.454 --> 02:52.721
I can't wait for that big ol'
pipe to get down there.

02:52.823 --> 02:54.523
There's no question about that.

02:56.727 --> 02:59.962
<i>Now that the area leading
to and around the original.</i>

03:00.064 --> 03:03.098
<i>Oak Island Money Pit is cleared
and leveled,</i>

03:03.200 --> 03:05.167
<i>it is time for the massive
drilling</i>

03:05.269 --> 03:08.003
<i>and digging equipment
to be brought in.</i>

03:08.105 --> 03:10.539
We're gonna actually
dig in the Money Pit.

03:10.641 --> 03:13.909
We're throwing everything
we got at this thing this year.

03:14.011 --> 03:16.645
We're gonna know in terms of
days, not years.

03:16.747 --> 03:19.314
<i>Working from archival maps</i>

03:19.416 --> 03:22.050
<i>and carefully calculated
measurements,</i>

03:22.152 --> 03:24.953
<i>Rick, Marty and their partners
have identified</i>

03:25.055 --> 03:29.491
<i>two target sites,
places which they hope will</i>

03:29.627 --> 03:32.227
<i>lead them to the ultimate
discovery.</i>

03:32.329 --> 03:34.930
<i>The first, known as Valley 3...</i>

03:35.032 --> 03:36.465
Definitely got wood.

03:36.567 --> 03:38.567
<i>Is the site of
a possible treasure vault,</i>

03:38.669 --> 03:42.237
<i>which Rick Lagina and Oak
Island partner Craig Tester,</i>

03:42.339 --> 03:44.039
<i>believe they located while</i>

03:44.141 --> 03:46.375
<i>looking for the Money
Pit site two years ago...</i>

03:46.477 --> 03:48.443
You think you're on the fault?

03:48.512 --> 03:51.647
<i>The second target site,
named C1...</i>

03:51.749 --> 03:53.215
Here we go.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.017
<i>Is the place where last summer.</i>

03:55.119 --> 03:58.020
<i>Rick and Oak Island historian
Charles Barkhouse</i>

03:58.122 --> 04:01.924
<i>discovered what appeared
to be a shiny, golden object</i>

04:02.026 --> 04:07.195
<i>located in a large void
some 170 deep underground.</i>

04:09.166 --> 04:11.099
Daniel!

04:11.201 --> 04:12.668
What do you think, Dan?

04:12.770 --> 04:16.971
You prepared
a hell of a big area here.

04:19.243 --> 04:22.110
<i>At the age of 93,</i>

04:22.212 --> 04:25.414
<i>Dan Blankenship has invested
more than five decades</i>

04:25.516 --> 04:28.684
<i>of his life to solving the
Oak Island mystery,</i>

04:28.752 --> 04:31.086
<i>and is still going strong.</i>

04:31.188 --> 04:32.621
So in all your years here,

04:32.723 --> 04:35.157
I mean, did you ever see it
coming to this?

04:35.259 --> 04:37.559
No.

04:37.661 --> 04:40.262
- Good.
- The old saying, Rick, is

04:40.364 --> 04:42.164
nothing ventured, nothing
gained.

04:42.266 --> 04:43.966
Exactly.

04:44.068 --> 04:48.503
This is the culmination for
you and your brother of your

04:48.605 --> 04:50.339
belief in Oak Island.

04:50.441 --> 04:52.374
Always have.

04:52.476 --> 04:54.609
A tremendous amount
of work went into this.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.445
There's no question about it.

04:56.547 --> 05:01.216
Not gonna leave, leave a stone
unturned or get half an answer,

05:01.318 --> 05:03.218
that's ridiculous.

05:03.320 --> 05:07.456
Well, after over fifty years
I'd like to have some positive

05:07.558 --> 05:09.491
answers one way or the other.

05:09.593 --> 05:11.259
We hope for this year.

05:11.362 --> 05:13.895
I hope so, too.

05:13.998 --> 05:18.333
It's about time!
Yeah, it's about time.

05:18.435 --> 05:20.502
Look, nobody wants this
to happen any more than

05:20.604 --> 05:22.437
Dan Blankenship does.

05:22.539 --> 05:25.040
He's committed his whole
adult life to this.

05:25.109 --> 05:28.944
And now, maybe, we're within
reach of getting him

05:29.046 --> 05:31.146
the answers that I think
he deserves.

05:32.683 --> 05:35.150
<i>For the Laginas
and their partners,</i>

05:35.252 --> 05:38.253
<i>the anticipation is intense,</i>

05:38.355 --> 05:41.356
<i>as the promise of
discovery becomes imminent.</i>

05:41.458 --> 05:45.193
<i>The most ambitious and
expensive attempt to solve</i>

05:45.295 --> 05:48.630
<i>the Oak Island mystery is
just days away.</i>

05:48.732 --> 05:50.499
The essence of Oak
Island is the Money Pit.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.367
I mean, that's what
captivated me,

05:52.469 --> 05:55.370
us, as little boys,
The Money Pit.

05:55.472 --> 05:57.439
Is there something in
the Money Pit?

05:57.541 --> 05:59.574
I absolutely believe there is.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.582
Welcome to what we

06:07.684 --> 06:09.051
affectionately call
our war room.

06:09.153 --> 06:10.419
- Thank you.
- Appreciate that.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.256
<i>While waiting for the
final pieces of digging</i>

06:14.358 --> 06:16.124
<i>equipment to arrive,</i>

06:16.226 --> 06:18.960
<i>Rick Lagina has invited
Oak Island researchers,</i>

06:19.063 --> 06:22.497
<i>Doug Crowell and
Kel Hancock to report on</i>

06:22.599 --> 06:25.634
<i>their ongoing investigation
into the fate of one of.</i>

06:25.736 --> 06:28.670
<i>Oak Island's biggest mysteries:</i>

06:28.772 --> 06:31.039
<i>The 90-foot stone,</i>

06:31.141 --> 06:33.308
<i>which was first discovered in
The Money Pit</i>

06:33.410 --> 06:37.245
<i>and has been missing for
nearly 100 years.</i>

06:37.347 --> 06:39.014
So what have you got for us?

06:39.116 --> 06:40.916
Well, in 1864,

06:41.018 --> 06:44.252
a three-part account was
published in a local Nova Scotia

06:44.354 --> 06:47.656
paper about the hunt to date.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.193
The stone disappeared.

06:51.295 --> 06:52.472
That immediately caught
the interest of the.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.296
Halifax Historical Society.

06:54.398 --> 06:57.265
They wrote a letter and said,
"where is the stone now?

06:57.367 --> 06:58.600
Who can we talk to to see it?"

06:58.702 --> 07:01.636
We wanted to try to
find that historical

07:01.738 --> 07:05.140
society's accounts of the stone.

07:05.242 --> 07:07.676
The thing with historical
societies is that they

07:07.744 --> 07:09.144
publish proceedings,

07:09.246 --> 07:12.214
and we're trying to find
those proceedings.

07:12.316 --> 07:14.756
There's a lot of unknowns in the
stories of the 90-foot stone.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.653
<i>When the Money Pit was
first excavated by</i>

07:18.755 --> 07:21.556
<i>the Onslow Company in 1804,</i>

07:21.658 --> 07:25.494
<i>a large, olive-colored stone
was reported to have had</i>

07:25.596 --> 07:28.163
<i>a number of strange symbols
carved into it,</i>

07:28.265 --> 07:30.332
<i>which when translated, read:</i>

07:30.434 --> 07:34.769
<i>"Forty feet below
two million pounds are buried."</i>

07:37.007 --> 07:41.009
<i>In 1865, it was removed from
Oak Island</i>

07:41.111 --> 07:43.245
<i>and taken to Halifax,</i>

07:43.347 --> 07:46.548
<i>where it was reported to have
been displayed in the window</i>

07:46.650 --> 07:49.017
<i>of the Creighton and Marshall's
Book Store</i>

07:49.119 --> 07:53.288
<i>in order to help raise money to
find the Oak Island treasure.</i>

07:53.390 --> 07:57.459
<i>But when the book store
closed in 1919</i>

07:57.561 --> 08:02.063
<i>the stone disappeared, and has
never been seen since.</i>

08:03.634 --> 08:07.002
We decided to look at the
accounts of it being in Halifax.

08:07.104 --> 08:11.506
So, Doug has our information
here and we'll share with you

08:11.608 --> 08:13.375
what our investigation
turned up.

08:13.477 --> 08:14.543
- Great.
- It would be

08:14.645 --> 08:16.878
highly meaningful to me,

08:16.980 --> 08:18.513
if that stone actually
showed up.

08:18.615 --> 08:21.316
The real stone, and it could
be verified as the real stone.

08:21.418 --> 08:25.520
Doug and Kel bring a serious
interest in Oak Island and also

08:25.622 --> 08:29.291
they have a-a background,
if you will, in proper research.

08:29.359 --> 08:33.562
And the Oak Island story is
all about looking backwards.

08:33.630 --> 08:39.100
Researching things that are oral
tradition and-and pursuing that.

08:39.203 --> 08:42.971
Okay, so where then
does this lead us?

08:43.073 --> 08:47.175
Well gentlemen, we found
the location of the stone.

08:50.414 --> 08:52.581
The last known location
of the stone.

08:55.052 --> 08:56.172
At the Halifax Seed Company?

08:56.253 --> 08:58.019
At the Halifax Seed Company.

08:58.121 --> 09:01.556
It certainly looks as if this
was the building that was the

09:01.692 --> 09:04.960
bookbindery from the stories
of the 90-foot stone.

09:05.062 --> 09:07.929
Creighton and
Marshall book store.

09:08.031 --> 09:09.351
And it exists;
It's not torn down?

09:09.399 --> 09:10.999
It's there? It's in Halifax?

09:11.101 --> 09:13.335
- It's standing today.
- It's standing today.

09:13.437 --> 09:15.303
Now in the stories,

09:15.405 --> 09:19.441
Creighton and Marshall closed
down in 1919.

09:19.543 --> 09:23.111
But the last time
a searcher saw that stone,

09:23.213 --> 09:24.079
wasn't it Bowdoin?

09:24.181 --> 09:25.480
- 1909.
- Yeah.

09:25.582 --> 09:27.582
Correct.

09:27.684 --> 09:32.153
<i>In 1909, treasure hunter
Captain Henry L. Bowdoin,</i>

09:32.256 --> 09:34.289
<i>along with future U.S. President.</i>

09:34.391 --> 09:36.091
<i>Franklin D. Roosevelt</i>

09:36.193 --> 09:40.295
<i>lead an attempt to solve the
Oak Island mystery.</i>

09:40.397 --> 09:44.432
<i>Bowdoin traveled to Halifax
to see the 90-foot stone</i>

09:44.534 --> 09:48.336
<i>at the book store, but became
horrified when he found out</i>

09:48.438 --> 09:50.605
<i>the stone was being
used as a cutting board</i>

09:50.707 --> 09:53.208
<i>for leather book jackets.</i>

09:53.310 --> 09:55.243
<i>Convinced the symbols
on the stone</i>

09:55.345 --> 09:57.412
<i>had been completely worn away,</i>

09:57.514 --> 10:00.649
<i>Bowdoin left Halifax
disappointed,</i>

10:00.751 --> 10:04.686
<i>and, after it was last
seen in 1919,</i>

10:04.788 --> 10:09.224
<i>the whereabouts of the stone
have remained unknown.</i>

10:09.326 --> 10:10.925
I can't believe that somebody

10:11.028 --> 10:12.494
hasn't taken a picture
of this thing,

10:12.596 --> 10:15.530
or even a rubbing of it...

10:15.666 --> 10:18.333
I refuse to believe
that there is not something

10:18.435 --> 10:20.602
that exists somewhere
in a Bible, in an attic.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.170
Somewhere.

10:22.272 --> 10:23.716
Maybe the bloody
thing's in the basement!

10:23.740 --> 10:26.341
- You never know.
- Yeah.

10:26.443 --> 10:28.176
So, what's the next step?

10:28.278 --> 10:30.078
The next step is to visit
the location.

10:30.180 --> 10:31.513
Perfect.

10:31.615 --> 10:32.514
We'll have a look
and see if there's anything

10:32.616 --> 10:34.115
in the basement.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.318
Okay, I say we appoint
an ad-hoc committee.

10:36.420 --> 10:39.020
And I know who I'd like
to appoint, him for sure.

10:39.122 --> 10:40.655
- And Alex.
- Yeah, I'll go with you.

10:40.757 --> 10:42.290
- Solid.
- Thank you very much

10:42.392 --> 10:43.958
for coming and sharing all
this with us.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.960
- It's always interesting.
- Right, all right.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.595
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:47.698 --> 10:48.763
Go get the stone!

10:50.634 --> 10:51.634
<i>Coming up...</i>

10:53.012 --> 10:56.880
<i>It is the start
of a new day on Oak Island.</i>

10:56.982 --> 10:59.917
<i>One that sees the assembly
of massive</i>

11:00.019 --> 11:04.054
<i>100 and 300 ton cranes
at the Money Pit site.</i>

11:10.529 --> 11:13.097
So guys, right here ahead
you see, over to the right?

11:13.199 --> 11:14.798
That's our target.

11:14.900 --> 11:15.999
- That's it.
- Okay.

11:16.102 --> 11:17.534
Cool.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.804
<i>This is also the day
that Marty Lagina's son.</i>

11:20.906 --> 11:24.374
<i>Alex and Oak Island historian
Charles Barkhouse,</i>

11:24.477 --> 11:27.478
<i>along with Doug Crowell
and Kel Hancock,</i>

11:27.580 --> 11:30.514
<i>have traveled some 60
miles north to the city</i>

11:30.616 --> 11:34.852
<i>of Halifax in search of Oak
Island's most mysterious</i>

11:34.954 --> 11:37.054
<i>and important artifact:</i>

11:37.156 --> 11:39.556
<i>The so-called 90-foot Stone.</i>

11:39.658 --> 11:42.159
Yeah, so this is it.
Right straight ahead.

11:42.261 --> 11:44.228
With the purple awning
and everything?

11:44.330 --> 11:45.829
Yep. With the purple awning.

11:45.931 --> 11:48.298
So Doug has a picture.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.869
And if you look at this picture,
you can see that the row

11:51.971 --> 11:55.773
of windows on the second
floor is identical.

11:55.875 --> 11:59.343
And if you look just above
the purple facade over there,

11:59.445 --> 12:01.779
you'll see where this window,
this window,

12:01.881 --> 12:05.382
and that vent hole had been
bricked in or patched over,

12:05.484 --> 12:07.050
and it matches identically.

12:07.153 --> 12:08.953
Yeah, I mean, you can
superimpose it perfectly

12:08.988 --> 12:10.521
it looks almost the same.

12:10.623 --> 12:12.334
This photo is the last known
location of the 90-foot stone.

12:12.358 --> 12:13.824
This is it.

12:13.926 --> 12:15.504
And we're looking at it,
I can tell right now.

12:15.528 --> 12:17.294
Right there.

12:17.396 --> 12:19.797
I've been looking for
the 90-foot stone for years now,

12:19.899 --> 12:21.098
and we are gonna be able

12:21.200 --> 12:22.800
to generate some other leads,
I think.

12:22.902 --> 12:25.202
So this is most
likely the window

12:25.304 --> 12:28.205
that the 90-foot stone would
have been placed on display.

12:28.307 --> 12:29.439
That's pretty cool to think

12:29.542 --> 12:30.908
that it could've been
right there.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.420
- Yeah.
- And we're standing here now.

12:32.444 --> 12:36.346
- We're standing right here.
- That's very cool.

12:36.448 --> 12:38.059
Well guys, Dr. Marble
and Joe Landry are waiting

12:38.083 --> 12:39.461
for us inside, so let's go in
and see them.

12:39.485 --> 12:41.318
Great. After you.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.086
Thanks, Doug.

12:44.590 --> 12:47.024
<i>Having identified
the exact location</i>

12:47.126 --> 12:51.228
<i>of where the 90-foot
stone was last seen in 1919...</i>

12:51.330 --> 12:52.863
Hello there, how are you?

12:52.965 --> 12:55.098
<i>Doug and Kel have arranged
to meet with.</i>

12:55.201 --> 12:56.834
<i>Dr. Allan Marble,</i>

12:56.936 --> 12:59.369
<i>the former president
of the Royal Nova Scotia.</i>

12:59.471 --> 13:02.840
<i>Historical Society, along
with building representative.</i>

13:02.942 --> 13:04.808
<i>Joe Landry.</i>

13:04.910 --> 13:06.454
This is the area we're
interested in, right?

13:06.478 --> 13:09.546
Yeah, this-this would be...
Now, of course, gentlemen,

13:09.648 --> 13:12.115
you know we're interested
in the story

13:12.218 --> 13:13.917
of the 90-foot stone,

13:14.019 --> 13:16.486
and the fact that it was brought
to a bookbindery in Halifax

13:16.589 --> 13:19.323
- to be put on public display.
- Yeah.

13:19.425 --> 13:21.792
We're pretty certain this is
the location.

13:21.894 --> 13:24.795
Well, I've done a lot
of reading on it over the years

13:24.897 --> 13:26.897
and I knew the stone of course,

13:26.999 --> 13:31.034
when it was found and where it
was in different eras.

13:31.136 --> 13:34.471
And I knew that it
had been here.

13:34.573 --> 13:36.484
The first thing I noticed when
I walked inside was how

13:36.508 --> 13:39.009
modern the inside of the
building was.

13:39.111 --> 13:42.079
It had clearly been renovated
and it was not anything

13:42.181 --> 13:44.815
like what I imagined
a book bindery to be.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.483
Are there any areas
of the building

13:46.585 --> 13:47.885
that have not been renovated

13:47.987 --> 13:50.520
or maybe fewer times
than this area?

13:50.623 --> 13:55.392
It's to a large extent
pretty much like it was.

13:55.494 --> 13:58.896
I mean, we've changed,
we put linoleum on the floors

13:58.998 --> 14:01.331
and tiles on the ceiling,
but apart from that,

14:01.433 --> 14:03.200
very little has changed.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.369
Is there a basement
to this unit here?

14:05.471 --> 14:07.204
Yes.
The basement runs the whole,

14:07.306 --> 14:09.940
the whole length of the block.

14:10.042 --> 14:11.775
Perhaps we should
take a look at that.

14:11.877 --> 14:14.912
Okay. Yes. We can head to the
back of the building here.

14:15.014 --> 14:16.613
- Excellent.
- We'll follow you.

14:21.053 --> 14:24.788
<i>Is it possible that clues
regarding the current location</i>

14:24.890 --> 14:27.090
<i>of the 90-foot stone might still</i>

14:27.192 --> 14:29.359
<i>be found at the old book bindery</i>

14:29.461 --> 14:33.797
<i>nearly 100 years after it
was last reported to be here?</i>

14:33.899 --> 14:35.065
Mind your heads.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.478
Careful of the debris
on the floor.

14:36.502 --> 14:38.135
Yeah. Geez, look at this place.

14:38.237 --> 14:40.971
We got a stone wall
in here, guys.

14:41.073 --> 14:42.572
All right.

14:42.675 --> 14:45.943
Yeah, this was a little bit more
like we were picturing, I think.

14:46.045 --> 14:51.148
Yeah, yeah, this is the old
stone foundations.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.083
- Here's some granite.
- Yeah.

14:53.185 --> 14:55.452
These look like they were put
in to repair the wall.

14:55.554 --> 14:57.254
Get a photo of this.

15:02.127 --> 15:05.329
- This is interesting.
- Yeah.

15:07.599 --> 15:09.366
Look at this, Charles.

15:09.468 --> 15:11.068
- An archway.
- Yeah.

15:11.170 --> 15:13.136
- Hey guys!
- What do we got?

15:13.238 --> 15:15.072
You might want
to come look at this.

15:15.174 --> 15:17.140
A boarded in archway.

15:17.242 --> 15:18.909
Just wondering
what this might have been.

15:19.011 --> 15:22.813
Well, Halifax is riddled
with tunnels and the origin

15:22.915 --> 15:24.595
of them and the reason why
there is so many

15:24.650 --> 15:26.783
is for military security,

15:26.885 --> 15:30.187
- military transportation.
- Right.

15:30.289 --> 15:33.223
<i>Underground military tunnels?</i>

15:33.325 --> 15:35.959
<i>Could this strange,
boarded-up archway</i>

15:36.061 --> 15:39.930
<i>really provide a clue as
to how the 90-foot stone seemed</i>

15:40.032 --> 15:42.366
<i>to vanish without a trace?</i>

15:42.468 --> 15:44.067
Why don't we head back upstairs

15:44.169 --> 15:46.003
and we can figure out
our next move.

15:46.105 --> 15:47.838
- Agreed.
- Sounds good to me.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.906
- Yeah.
- After you, Kel.

15:50.009 --> 15:52.009
I knew it was kind of
a long shot that maybe

15:52.111 --> 15:54.578
we'd find something down there,
but it was worth a look.

15:55.948 --> 15:58.348
- Different exit, hey Joe?
- Indeed.

15:58.450 --> 16:00.751
- This building's like a maze.
- It is.

16:00.853 --> 16:02.252
Well guys,

16:02.354 --> 16:03.999
I think we're leaving here with
some good information.

16:04.023 --> 16:06.156
We can look into a little more

16:06.258 --> 16:09.059
of the owners of this building
throughout history.

16:09.161 --> 16:11.828
We can look for anybody
that may have taken a photo

16:11.930 --> 16:13.997
of the storefront when the stone
was on display.

16:14.099 --> 16:18.769
But the other possibility,
it may be closer than that;

16:18.871 --> 16:22.773
I've been told that there was
a member of the Halifax Club.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.875
Which is just down here
a short distance.

16:24.977 --> 16:28.245
He was a member
at least until 1982

16:28.347 --> 16:31.248
and he told his son
that in fact there was a stone

16:31.350 --> 16:33.550
in the floor of
the Halifax club,

16:33.652 --> 16:37.988
which he thought was
the 90-foot stone.

16:38.090 --> 16:40.157
I don't know, but that's
what he told his son.

16:40.259 --> 16:42.092
Is the Halifax Club
still in operation?

16:42.194 --> 16:45.195
It is. It's just three
blocks up Hollis Street

16:45.297 --> 16:47.409
and I can take you up there
if you'd like to take a look.

16:47.433 --> 16:48.832
Another lead, yeah.

16:48.934 --> 16:51.068
You never know,
the-the Marshalls

16:51.170 --> 16:53.381
and the Creightons may have
been members of the Halifax Club

16:53.405 --> 16:55.272
which you could
possibly determine.

16:55.374 --> 16:59.376
In 1919, when they realized they
were closing up the shop

16:59.478 --> 17:03.080
they may have decided to
donate it to the Halifax Club.

17:03.182 --> 17:04.414
It's a possibility.

17:04.516 --> 17:06.516
Seems pretty plausible to me,
honestly.

17:06.617 --> 17:08.050
It's worth tracking down anyway.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.453
- Let's go look.
- Yeah.

17:09.555 --> 17:11.988
- Joe, thank you for joining us.
- You're welcome.

17:12.090 --> 17:15.392
<i>Could Alex and the team
actually be within reach</i>

17:15.493 --> 17:17.961
<i>of locating one of the key clues</i>

17:18.063 --> 17:20.230
<i>in solving in the
Oak Island mystery?</i>

17:20.332 --> 17:22.132
All right guys,
let's go for a walk.

17:22.233 --> 17:23.633
Yeah.

17:29.190 --> 17:32.858
<i>While Alex Lagina
and Charles Barkhouse continue</i>

17:32.960 --> 17:36.796
<i>their search for the 90-foot
stone in nearby Halifax,</i>

17:36.898 --> 17:39.632
<i>back on Oak Island, Craig Tester</i>

17:39.734 --> 17:41.667
<i>and his stepson, Jack Begley,</i>

17:41.769 --> 17:45.504
<i>begin a strategic investigation
at Smith's Cove.</i>

17:45.606 --> 17:48.707
Probably over
by this pine tree right here,

17:48.810 --> 17:50.576
try to start it right in there.
Okay.

17:50.678 --> 17:53.712
<i>Working with ground
penetrating radar experts,</i>

17:53.815 --> 17:56.148
<i>Matt Savelle and Luke Melanson</i>

17:56.250 --> 17:58.150
<i>from Canadian Seabed
Research Limited...</i>

17:58.252 --> 17:59.885
Right here's good.

17:59.987 --> 18:03.088
<i>Craig and Jack are hoping
to locate evidence</i>

18:03.191 --> 18:05.958
<i>of possible underground
flood tunnels,</i>

18:06.060 --> 18:09.562
<i>the same flood tunnels that
reportedly feed ocean water</i>

18:09.664 --> 18:12.031
<i>into the Money Pit
and as a result,</i>

18:12.133 --> 18:14.600
<i>have thwarted
treasure-hunting efforts</i>

18:14.702 --> 18:17.503
<i>for more than two hundred years.</i>

18:17.605 --> 18:19.972
Traditionally,
there was a flood tunnel

18:20.074 --> 18:21.941
that went from Smith's
Cove here,

18:22.043 --> 18:23.509
up to the Money Pit.

18:23.611 --> 18:25.911
So it cut right through here
somewhere.

18:26.013 --> 18:30.115
<i>In 1850, searchers
from the Truro Company,</i>

18:30.218 --> 18:33.185
<i>working at Smith's
Cove, unearthed evidence</i>

18:33.287 --> 18:36.155
<i>of five intricate box drains.</i>

18:36.257 --> 18:39.091
<i>They were constructed
of flat paving stones</i>

18:39.193 --> 18:43.562
<i>and covered by layers
of coconut fiber and eel grass,</i>

18:43.664 --> 18:47.132
<i>which were intended to filter
out sand and debris.</i>

18:47.235 --> 18:50.002
<i>Unfortunately, generations</i>

18:50.104 --> 18:55.007
<i>of repeated excavations have
destroyed important evidence.</i>

18:55.109 --> 18:57.042
<i>But if the Oak Island team</i>

18:57.144 --> 18:59.945
<i>can locate even one
of the box drains</i>

19:00.047 --> 19:02.748
<i>and trace it back
to the Money Pit,</i>

19:02.850 --> 19:04.483
<i>they may be able to shut off</i>

19:04.585 --> 19:06.785
<i>the booby-trapped
flooding system.</i>

19:06.888 --> 19:10.055
<i>They also may be able
to determine just</i>

19:10.157 --> 19:14.627
<i>who constructed the box drains
in the first place.</i>

19:14.729 --> 19:17.730
I think the Smith's Cove
work is gonna be instrumental

19:17.832 --> 19:20.833
in understanding what possibly
happened on Oak Island.

19:20.935 --> 19:22.201
You find the box drains...

19:22.303 --> 19:24.503
Box drains lead
to a flood tunnel.

19:24.605 --> 19:26.538
The flood tunnel leads to the
Money Pit.

19:26.641 --> 19:28.507
It all begins at Smith's Cove.

19:28.609 --> 19:32.578
When the finger drains came
together, they formed a "V",

19:32.680 --> 19:35.114
and that "V" would
be facing this way

19:35.216 --> 19:36.949
and came toward shore.

19:37.051 --> 19:40.152
So if we could find out where
the "V" is cut in through here,

19:40.254 --> 19:42.187
- that'd be significant.
- Okay.

19:42.290 --> 19:43.822
- You ready?
- Okay.

19:45.293 --> 19:47.927
This is quite the mystery.

19:48.029 --> 19:51.764
We want to see for ourselves
that this flood system is here

19:51.866 --> 19:54.700
and how much of it is real,
how much of it is just story

19:54.802 --> 19:57.636
that was expanded
over the years.

19:57.738 --> 20:01.840
<i>As the Ground Penetrating
Radar System is pulled back</i>

20:01.943 --> 20:04.743
<i>and forth in straight,
parallel lines,</i>

20:04.845 --> 20:08.847
<i>electromagnetic pulses are
sent through the earth.</i>

20:08.950 --> 20:12.685
<i>If successful, Craig
and the team might be able</i>

20:12.787 --> 20:15.721
<i>to detect underground
structures or tunnels</i>

20:15.823 --> 20:18.590
<i>that lie below the surface.</i>

20:21.295 --> 20:23.963
- That's good.
- Yeah.

20:24.065 --> 20:25.798
- Any penetration?
- Nothing, well, yeah,

20:25.900 --> 20:28.834
but there's nothing striking.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.102
Okay.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.808
You don't get an exact image
of what's down there,

20:35.910 --> 20:38.911
but you'll get what they
call a parabola.

20:39.013 --> 20:41.914
We're getting preliminary
results.

20:42.016 --> 20:44.750
Maybe it could be
wave action from

20:44.852 --> 20:47.119
200 years ago that
cut into there.

20:47.221 --> 20:50.289
But it's definitely something
we need to pursue.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.226
That was an interesting one.

20:54.328 --> 20:57.062
It's got a very distinct "U",
and you can see

20:57.164 --> 21:00.532
the little... little V's
along the bottom of it.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.202
<i>Is it possible that Craig,</i>

21:03.304 --> 21:06.572
<i>Jack and the team have just
discovered evidence</i>

21:06.674 --> 21:09.975
<i>of manmade construction
at Smith's Cove?</i>

21:10.077 --> 21:11.977
We started getting good hits

21:12.079 --> 21:13.912
and it really looked like we
were seeing

21:14.015 --> 21:17.983
these spikey responses from
the ground penetrating radar.

21:18.085 --> 21:19.685
I felt it was very good
reflections.

21:19.787 --> 21:21.286
It was definitely seeing
some sort

21:21.389 --> 21:23.322
of gouge being cut in there.

21:23.424 --> 21:25.724
Just based on this, you know,

21:25.826 --> 21:28.794
I think I have an idea
where I would like us

21:28.896 --> 21:30.129
- to do an excavation.
- Yeah.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.566
<i>While Craig Tester
and Jack Begley</i>

21:34.668 --> 21:38.737
<i>wrap up their team's operations
at Smith's Cove,</i>

21:38.839 --> 21:44.209
<i>Alex Lagina and his team arrive
at the Halifax Club</i>

21:44.311 --> 21:48.113
<i>where the mysterious 90-foot
stone slab from the Money Pit</i>

21:48.215 --> 21:53.285
<i>was reportedly
seen back in 1982.</i>

21:53.387 --> 21:55.988
Now, this is a very
classic building.

21:56.090 --> 21:57.556
A beautiful building.

21:57.658 --> 22:01.293
Yeah.
Here it is right here. 1862.

22:01.395 --> 22:04.029
<i>Built in 1862</i>

22:04.131 --> 22:07.266
<i>by Scottish-born stonemason,
George Lang,</i>

22:07.368 --> 22:11.804
<i>The Halifax Club was an
exclusive male-only fraternity</i>

22:11.906 --> 22:14.306
<i>whose members included
the most prominent</i>

22:14.408 --> 22:17.042
<i>and distinguished men
of the city.</i>

22:17.144 --> 22:20.813
<i>Its headquarters was also
a meeting place where business</i>

22:20.915 --> 22:23.615
<i>could be conducted in private.</i>

22:23.717 --> 22:27.052
<i>Could the 90-foot stone
really have ended up here,</i>

22:27.154 --> 22:29.688
<i>embedded in the floor?</i>

22:29.790 --> 22:33.792
<i>And if so,
who brought it here, and why?</i>

22:41.302 --> 22:43.769
Wow, it looks like they're
doing some renovation.

22:43.871 --> 22:45.537
They sure are. Yes.

22:45.639 --> 22:49.174
So the story you heard is
that the stone was in the floor?

22:49.276 --> 22:51.677
Yes. They said it was supposed
to be seen in the floor.

22:51.779 --> 22:53.879
But of course we don't
know which floor,

22:53.981 --> 22:55.614
whether it was here or in here

22:55.716 --> 22:58.784
or up in the dining room
or where it was.

22:58.886 --> 23:00.953
No information was given.

23:01.055 --> 23:02.654
I was picturing we'd be walking

23:02.756 --> 23:04.289
into this intact building

23:04.391 --> 23:07.192
and just be able to go right
to the stone and look at it.

23:07.294 --> 23:08.994
No. This is a wood floor.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.096
But of course it didn't
work out that way.

23:11.198 --> 23:14.166
- Hey guys, what's up?
- Hey!

23:14.268 --> 23:16.034
Alex. Nice to meet you.

23:16.137 --> 23:18.103
<i>Shortly after their arrival,</i>

23:18.205 --> 23:20.772
<i>Alex and the team are
met by Ryan Burke</i>

23:20.875 --> 23:22.641
<i>and Zach Woodworth,</i>

23:22.743 --> 23:26.078
<i>who are members of the Halifax
Club's construction crew.</i>

23:26.180 --> 23:27.691
You could probably
look in the basement.

23:27.715 --> 23:28.955
- Basement.
- Over a stone wall,

23:29.016 --> 23:29.715
or something like that.

23:29.817 --> 23:31.049
Right. Okay.

23:31.152 --> 23:32.596
Well let's-let's just start
in the basement.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.930
I mean, it seems like
the best bet.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.621
- We can cross that one off.
- Absolutely.

23:35.723 --> 23:38.056
A large stone,
the size of the one

23:38.159 --> 23:40.092
that we're looking for
is very heavy.

23:40.194 --> 23:41.894
So the logic is,

23:41.996 --> 23:43.573
if you're looking for somewhere
that's gonna support the stone,

23:43.597 --> 23:44.863
you put it in the basement.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.965
From this point
on would be the old building,

23:47.067 --> 23:48.700
before it was renovated.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.003
Up that way is post renovation.

23:51.105 --> 23:52.504
So that's all newer down there?

23:52.606 --> 23:53.886
- Yes.
- Yeah, we'd definitely be

23:53.974 --> 23:55.252
interested in this side then.
All right.

23:55.276 --> 23:57.976
Okay. Let's have a look
this way.

23:58.078 --> 23:59.778
All right.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.080
Yeah, the floor's all gutted out
and everything.

24:02.183 --> 24:05.117
- This is all pretty torn up.
- Yeah.

24:05.219 --> 24:07.653
- Same here.
- Yeah.

24:07.755 --> 24:09.221
In here it was just wood floor

24:09.323 --> 24:11.101
and we haven't actually touched
any of the dirt below it.

24:11.125 --> 24:12.524
We just tore up all the
old wood.

24:12.626 --> 24:13.904
So there was just dirt
underneath wood?

24:13.928 --> 24:15.394
Yeah.

24:18.365 --> 24:20.632
There was
some stone walls, though,

24:20.734 --> 24:22.568
and little foundation pieces.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.036
I didn't see anything special.

24:24.138 --> 24:25.138
Okay.

24:28.275 --> 24:30.509
- There's a sub-basement.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:30.611 --> 24:31.944
Any idea how to get down there?

24:32.046 --> 24:34.012
- Absolutely.
- That's the next stop.

24:34.114 --> 24:35.214
Alex!

24:35.316 --> 24:37.182
- Yeah?
- Come take a look at this.

24:37.284 --> 24:38.984
All right. Where are you at?

24:39.086 --> 24:40.686
- Over this way.
- Over this way?

24:40.788 --> 24:44.256
Yeah. Watch your step there.

24:44.358 --> 24:47.025
- It's through here.
- In there.

24:47.127 --> 24:48.760
All right, what you got here?

24:48.862 --> 24:51.797
- It's a big stone.
- Well, look at that.

24:56.820 --> 25:00.122
- It's a big stone.
- Well, look at that!

25:00.224 --> 25:03.759
<i>Approximately 60 miles
from Oak Island,</i>

25:03.861 --> 25:05.761
<i>Alex Lagina and members</i>

25:05.863 --> 25:09.498
<i>of the Oak Island team are
investigating a location</i>

25:09.600 --> 25:11.600
<i>where the 90-foot stone slab</i>

25:11.702 --> 25:17.172
<i>from the Money Pit was
reportedly seen back in 1982.</i>

25:17.274 --> 25:19.541
- Is it slate?
- I think it's limestone.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.288
It's also bigger than what
we're looking for,

25:21.312 --> 25:23.812
in terms of the dimensions.

25:23.914 --> 25:25.614
I think it's a bust.

25:25.716 --> 25:27.861
We learned a lot today even
though we didn't find anything.

25:27.885 --> 25:29.084
I think the first order

25:29.186 --> 25:31.186
of business is to get
the real story

25:31.288 --> 25:34.590
about why the stone was
supposedly in the Halifax Club.

25:34.692 --> 25:36.692
If we can get that story
from the person

25:36.794 --> 25:38.474
who saw it or from their
direct descendant,

25:38.562 --> 25:40.662
we may have a better shot
at finding it.

25:40.764 --> 25:44.166
One thing I would
suggest you do is talk

25:44.268 --> 25:46.635
to the historian
of this building.

25:46.737 --> 25:48.837
There should be a collection
of photographs,

25:48.939 --> 25:53.475
and if there was something as
unique as a stone in a floor

25:53.577 --> 25:56.578
that had any symbolic
representation on it,

25:56.680 --> 25:57.924
someone would have
photographed it.

25:57.948 --> 25:59.481
- Yeah.
- But for now,

25:59.583 --> 26:00.827
we didn't find what we were
looking for,

26:00.851 --> 26:02.162
but I think we made
some progress.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.219
We've got some good leads
to chase down.

26:04.321 --> 26:06.655
- Let's call it a day.
- Yeah.

26:06.757 --> 26:09.625
<i>While Alex Lagina</i>

26:09.727 --> 26:14.496
<i>and Charles Barkhouse make
their way back to Oak Island...</i>

26:14.598 --> 26:16.732
You need me to pull it?

26:16.834 --> 26:18.800
We'll pull it up to here
and lock it all together.

26:18.902 --> 26:22.437
<i>Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with Craig Tester,</i>

26:22.539 --> 26:25.741
<i>are removing a number of
logs from the Money Pit area...</i>

26:25.843 --> 26:27.709
Okay!

26:27.811 --> 26:31.880
<i>In order to make room for
their large-scale excavation.</i>

26:31.982 --> 26:33.548
Okay. Heads up.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.323
We got company.

26:45.329 --> 26:47.729
We've got company!

26:47.831 --> 26:50.232
- Shut it down for a minute.
- Right.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.136
Rick, come here.

26:57.274 --> 26:59.875
Hi, Rick.

26:59.977 --> 27:02.511
Welcome back. Welcome back.

27:02.613 --> 27:06.882
<i>Of all of the lives that have
been touched by the 221-year</i>

27:06.984 --> 27:08.950
<i>search for treasure
on Oak Island,</i>

27:09.053 --> 27:13.822
<i>perhaps none has been affected
as personally or tragically as</i>

27:13.924 --> 27:15.090
<i>that of Lee Lamb.</i>

27:15.192 --> 27:16.692
I'm not sure if
you met my brother.

27:16.794 --> 27:19.428
- This is Marty.
- No, I've never met Marty.

27:19.530 --> 27:21.207
- I've heard all about you.
- We're Italian.

27:21.231 --> 27:23.131
You're not going to
get away with that.

27:23.233 --> 27:24.966
<i>She has returned to Oak Island</i>

27:25.069 --> 27:27.703
<i>after an absence of three years.</i>

27:27.805 --> 27:30.105
<i>And with her are her
two children,</i>

27:30.207 --> 27:32.774
<i>Claire Bradfield
and Brook Helland.</i>

27:32.876 --> 27:34.943
Looks a little different.
Doesn't it, Lee?

27:35.045 --> 27:38.080
Where am I?

27:38.182 --> 27:39.225
- You're at the Money Pit.
- You're at the Monty Pit.

27:39.249 --> 27:40.816
For goodness sake.

27:43.053 --> 27:46.121
This is a fairly large
scale project this year.

27:46.223 --> 27:49.858
It's amazing. I mean, fantastic.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.160
What's gonna happen here, Lee,

27:51.195 --> 27:52.828
is right near the Money Pit,

27:52.930 --> 27:55.697
right where we think the
old vault from years ago...

27:55.799 --> 27:57.232
- Okay.
- We're gonna dig

27:57.334 --> 28:00.569
a 40 inch hole big enough
for a person to get down.

28:00.671 --> 28:01.903
Really.

28:02.005 --> 28:04.639
All the way down to
as deep as 200 feet.

28:04.742 --> 28:06.241
Wow.

28:06.343 --> 28:08.543
You know, I can't help but
wonder what your father could

28:08.579 --> 28:09.978
have done if he'd had that.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.847
Yes!

28:16.687 --> 28:22.090
<i>In 1959, Lee's parents,
Robert and Mildred Restall,</i>

28:22.192 --> 28:26.128
along with her two brothers
Bobby Jr. and Rickie

28:26.230 --> 28:30.465
<i>moved to Oak Island in an
effort to solve the mystery.</i>

28:30.567 --> 28:34.102
<i>For six years they braved the
harsh weather of the north.</i>

28:34.204 --> 28:38.173
<i>Atlantic while doing
extensive work in the swamp,</i>

28:38.275 --> 28:41.810
<i>at Smith's Cove and
at the Money Pit.</i>

28:41.912 --> 28:46.214
I feel that the treasure is
here and that we can get it,

28:46.316 --> 28:50.185
and we're going to stay here
until we do.

28:50.287 --> 28:55.991
<i>But on August 17, 1965,
while investigating</i>

28:56.093 --> 29:00.162
<i>a flooded 27-foot deep shaft
at Smith's Cove,</i>

29:00.264 --> 29:05.033
<i>Robert was overcome
by deadly H2S gas</i>

29:05.135 --> 29:07.903
<i>and fell into the water below.</i>

29:10.808 --> 29:13.708
<i>Although Bobby Jr.
And four other men</i>

29:13.811 --> 29:17.179
<i>jumped in to help him,
they too were</i>

29:17.281 --> 29:21.550
<i>quickly incapacitated by the
deadly gas.</i>

29:21.652 --> 29:24.753
<i>Despite a frantic rescue effort,</i>

29:24.855 --> 29:30.258
<i>both Robert and Bobby Restall
perished along with two others.</i>

29:30.360 --> 29:32.928
<i>Soon afterwards,
Lee Lamb's mother</i>

29:33.030 --> 29:36.832
<i>and brother left the island
and never returned.</i>

29:39.369 --> 29:41.570
So Lee, what brings you here?

29:41.672 --> 29:44.940
Well, I brought something
to show you that may please you.

29:45.042 --> 29:47.108
I'd love to see it. Absolutely.

29:47.211 --> 29:49.711
Okay, Brook, maybe you
could take it out.

29:49.813 --> 29:51.713
You know, when Lee Lamb
comes to the island,

29:51.815 --> 29:55.517
it's always a reminder embodied
within a living person

29:55.619 --> 29:56.885
of the Restall years.

29:56.987 --> 29:58.598
Why don't we just bring that
over on the tail

29:58.622 --> 30:00.288
of the Yukon so we can
have a look at it.

30:00.390 --> 30:01.790
That would be great.

30:01.892 --> 30:03.658
I don't think Oak Island
would mean as much

30:03.760 --> 30:06.061
without the sacrifices
that family made.

30:06.163 --> 30:10.632
I mean, the price that family
paid is incredible.

30:10.734 --> 30:12.200
- Shall I show you?
- Yeah, please.

30:19.776 --> 30:22.244
So this was found on the beach.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.950
It's the 1704 stone.

30:30.854 --> 30:33.021
- That's almost mythic.
- Yeah.

30:33.123 --> 30:37.759
<i>In 1960, the so-called
1704 stone</i>

30:37.861 --> 30:40.262
<i>was discovered by Lee's
mother Mildred,</i>

30:40.364 --> 30:44.032
<i>while Robert and Bobby Restall
were looking for evidence</i>

30:44.134 --> 30:47.836
<i>of box drains and flood tunnels
at Smith's Cove.</i>

30:47.938 --> 30:50.205
<i>Although it has never
been determined just</i>

30:50.307 --> 30:53.742
<i>when the stone was carved
or who carved it,</i>

30:53.844 --> 30:56.645
<i>it has always been considered
an intriguing piece</i>

30:56.747 --> 30:59.080
<i>of the Oak Island puzzle.</i>

30:59.182 --> 31:01.283
- You really should feel it.
- I'd love...

31:01.385 --> 31:03.251
Like, feel the depth
of the carving.

31:03.353 --> 31:04.853
Feel the stone.

31:06.623 --> 31:10.158
Somebody worked on that. 1704.

31:10.260 --> 31:11.693
And of course, we don't know

31:11.795 --> 31:14.629
if it's a year
or if it's a distance.

31:14.731 --> 31:19.034
Looking at the 1704 stone,
I think about the sacrifices

31:19.136 --> 31:21.102
that others have made
on this island

31:21.204 --> 31:25.473
and it makes us realize
how serious a quest

31:25.575 --> 31:29.210
this has been and-and will be.

31:29.313 --> 31:34.616
It's an intense moment
because within that stone,

31:34.718 --> 31:37.819
that hardened surface is raw
emotion.

31:37.921 --> 31:42.023
Here in your hand you hold
a family's legacy.

31:42.125 --> 31:46.594
Painted in that stone are
the pictures of her mom,

31:46.697 --> 31:51.066
her father, her brother.

31:51.168 --> 31:53.234
So for Lee Lamb,

31:53.337 --> 31:56.571
that stone is the Restall
treasure.

31:56.673 --> 31:59.507
I mean, Dad wrote
in his letters,

31:59.609 --> 32:01.743
it came from three feet
or deeper.

32:01.845 --> 32:03.578
- Wow.
- That is was down among

32:03.680 --> 32:07.215
the beach work that
the pirates did, I mean...

32:07.317 --> 32:10.085
I'm thinking we can actually
go down to Smith's Cove.

32:10.187 --> 32:12.721
'Cause we'd like to show you
what we intend to do.

32:12.823 --> 32:16.807
- Great. Wonderful.
- Yeah.

32:26.937 --> 32:28.336
- Brook?
- Yeah?

32:28.438 --> 32:32.607
This is the monument... that
that's what Dan put up.

32:32.709 --> 32:35.243
- Really?
- It's really lovely.

32:35.345 --> 32:40.682
<i>When Lee Lamb visited Oak
Island three years ago...</i>

32:40.784 --> 32:42.817
These are Bobby's journals.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.686
<i>She brought with her a series</i>

32:44.788 --> 32:46.955
<i>of journals written
by her brother Bobby,</i>

32:47.057 --> 32:49.324
<i>shortly before his death.</i>

32:49.426 --> 32:51.593
<i>In them were contained maps</i>

32:51.695 --> 32:54.195
<i>and other important information.</i>

32:54.297 --> 32:58.133
<i>The journals also suggested
the Restalls were just days</i>

32:58.235 --> 33:00.935
<i>away from making
a major discovery,</i>

33:01.038 --> 33:04.739
<i>before Lee's brother Bobby and
their father, Robert Restall,</i>

33:04.841 --> 33:06.608
<i>along with two others,</i>

33:06.710 --> 33:09.177
<i>Cyril Hiltz and Karl Grasser,</i>

33:09.279 --> 33:14.115
<i>died tragically at the bottom
of a treasure shaft.</i>

33:14.217 --> 33:16.017
We'd like to show you this area

33:16.119 --> 33:17.552
and then we can point out
where we,

33:17.654 --> 33:19.120
where we're going to do
the work,

33:19.222 --> 33:21.856
but then you might reference
where the stone was found.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.958
Show me the cofferdam.

33:24.061 --> 33:25.794
The one that you
may be referring to

33:25.896 --> 33:29.564
is what the searchers put out
there in like 1850, 1960...

33:29.666 --> 33:32.067
Yes I am, but that's the only
one there was then.

33:32.169 --> 33:34.035
That would be, you can
see the big boulder.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.348
- Yeah.
- Then you come this way.

33:35.372 --> 33:36.738
And then there's a line of rocks

33:36.840 --> 33:38.184
sticking out of the water
right now.

33:38.208 --> 33:39.252
- Yeah.
- That would have been the edge

33:39.276 --> 33:41.576
of that cofferdam.

33:41.678 --> 33:44.279
The reason I was asking
about the cofferdam is,

33:44.381 --> 33:46.881
that the filter system was
situated

33:46.983 --> 33:48.983
- precisely in the middle of it.
- Sure.

33:49.086 --> 33:50.430
So you know, so you could, if
you could see it,

33:50.454 --> 33:52.153
then you know where the filter
system was.

33:52.255 --> 33:53.788
- Right.
- And that's where that

33:53.890 --> 33:56.357
- 1704 stone was found.
- Okay.

33:56.460 --> 33:59.094
I think that
everything Lee Lamb said down

33:59.196 --> 34:00.762
at Smith's Cove makes sense

34:00.864 --> 34:02.964
with our understanding of
what happened down there,

34:03.066 --> 34:05.600
and where her father was digging

34:05.702 --> 34:08.235
and where her father found
the box drains.

34:08.338 --> 34:09.838
I think everything she
said verifies

34:09.940 --> 34:12.206
that it's worth our while to
have a look

34:12.309 --> 34:15.243
ourselves to try and
unearth one of those things.

34:15.344 --> 34:21.181
This end of the cofferdam
was the little bedroom shack

34:21.284 --> 34:23.784
that Ricky and Bobby used
was right there.

34:23.887 --> 34:26.654
And right besides that and back

34:26.755 --> 34:30.190
about three feet was the
vertical shaft that Dad found.

34:30.293 --> 34:34.129
- Okay.
- So that part got very dug up.

34:34.231 --> 34:35.929
So you have a better chance

34:36.032 --> 34:38.933
of finding something pristine
at that end.

34:39.034 --> 34:40.980
That's fantastic, 'cause
that's what we want to look for.

34:41.004 --> 34:42.804
But he found a shaft over here?
Your dad did?

34:42.906 --> 34:44.139
I guess I didn't know that.

34:44.241 --> 34:45.952
- A vertical shaft, yeah.
- A vertical shaft.

34:45.976 --> 34:47.786
Do you know where that is?
It's on the maps right?

34:47.811 --> 34:50.089
This shaft? How come we never
went to have a look at that?

34:50.112 --> 34:52.045
Well, I'd be surprised if you
can see anything

34:52.149 --> 34:56.951
because when Robert Dunfield
left the island...

34:57.053 --> 34:58.831
Right, but if it's on the map,
we could find it.

34:58.855 --> 34:59.988
Good luck with that.

35:01.758 --> 35:04.526
<i>Within days of the tragedy
that claimed the lives</i>

35:04.628 --> 35:06.895
<i>of Lee Lamb's father and
brother,</i>

35:06.997 --> 35:09.731
<i>Robert Restall's business
partner and fellow</i>

35:09.833 --> 35:11.900
<i>treasure hunter,
Robert Dunfield,</i>

35:12.002 --> 35:15.637
<i>took over operations on
Oak Island and launched</i>

35:15.739 --> 35:18.806
<i>what many believe was an
all-out assault on</i>

35:18.909 --> 35:21.042
<i>the Eastern end of the island.</i>

35:21.144 --> 35:23.978
<i>In an effort to stop the
booby-trapped flood tunnels</i>

35:24.080 --> 35:26.714
<i>believed to exist
at Smith's Cove,</i>

35:26.816 --> 35:31.853
<i>he bulldozed tons of earth
over the entire area.</i>

35:31.955 --> 35:34.656
<i>Even more invasive
was Dunfield's</i>

35:34.758 --> 35:36.758
<i>excavation of the Money Pit</i>

35:36.860 --> 35:40.895
<i>which involved the digging
of a massive 100-foot wide,</i>

35:40.997 --> 35:43.831
<i>140-foot deep hole.</i>

35:43.934 --> 35:47.001
<i>When it collapsed due to
heavy rain and flooding,</i>

35:47.103 --> 35:51.873
<i>the hole was hastily filled in
and several valuable clues that</i>

35:51.975 --> 35:55.910
<i>had been carefully documented
during the previous 150 years</i>

35:56.012 --> 35:59.847
<i>of treasure hunting were
potentially lost forever.</i>

36:01.685 --> 36:03.629
Bring that frontend loader
down here, and I can clear it.

36:03.653 --> 36:05.298
- Yeah, I know, David.
- No, no, no, David.

36:05.322 --> 36:07.021
Not quite like that, no.

36:07.123 --> 36:10.024
Now we'll have to go back
and revisit the maps,

36:10.126 --> 36:13.695
her father's maps,
and Bobby Jr.'s maps to see if

36:13.797 --> 36:16.531
it is that easily locatable.

36:16.633 --> 36:18.666
Look, I don't even
want to say goodbye,

36:18.768 --> 36:20.034
because as you well know,

36:20.136 --> 36:21.869
you're always welcome here,
but we thank you

36:21.972 --> 36:24.005
graciously for coming,

36:24.107 --> 36:26.741
and every time you come we
learn something.

36:26.843 --> 36:28.576
Well thanks, Rick.

36:28.678 --> 36:32.814
I'm, you know, I'm just amazed
at how welcoming you have been,

36:32.916 --> 36:34.582
- all of you.
- All I can say

36:34.684 --> 36:37.285
- is drop in more often.
- Okay.

36:37.387 --> 36:40.555
Okay, well, let's get going.

36:40.657 --> 36:44.025
<i>Lee Lamb's surprise visit to
Oak Island has brought</i>

36:44.127 --> 36:46.261
<i>even more hope of new
discoveries</i>

36:46.363 --> 36:49.597
<i>to Rick, Marty, and their
partners.</i>

36:49.699 --> 36:52.934
<i>And all though much on the
island has changed over</i>

36:53.036 --> 36:55.003
<i>the last 50 years,</i>

36:55.105 --> 36:59.907
<i>the island's ability to stir
the imagination and fuel</i>

37:00.010 --> 37:02.844
<i>obsession remains undiminished.</i>

37:15.567 --> 37:18.735
<i>After more than a
decade of exploration,</i>

37:18.837 --> 37:23.439
<i>research, and persistence
and after an investment of</i>

37:23.541 --> 37:26.009
<i>millions of dollars...</i>

37:26.111 --> 37:28.745
- Now, there it is.
- There it is right there.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.646
- Here it comes.
- Big gray truck!

37:30.749 --> 37:32.882
The oscillator.

37:32.984 --> 37:36.786
<i>Brothers Rick and Marty
Lagina are about to witness</i>

37:36.888 --> 37:40.289
<i>the beginning of a
life-long dream.</i>

37:40.392 --> 37:42.558
<i>They are ready to begin the
first excavation of</i>

37:42.660 --> 37:46.062
<i>the Money Pit in more than
half a century.</i>

37:46.164 --> 37:48.798
It's really exciting
because we have the equipment

37:48.900 --> 37:51.734
and we can find the old
vault if it's there.

37:51.836 --> 37:55.805
So, high hopes that we're right
on and we're gonna bring up

37:55.907 --> 37:58.574
something very significant.
We have the material,

37:58.676 --> 38:01.844
the equipment and the manpower
to do it.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.479
It's the Money Pit,
for gosh sakes.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.549
And, you know, we hope we're 140
feet away from getting,

38:06.651 --> 38:10.386
finally, real answers
from Oak Island.

38:10.488 --> 38:12.288
- You guys about ready?
- Yeah!

38:12.390 --> 38:13.923
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.070
All right. So, we got the crane
rigged up, it's going to take

38:16.094 --> 38:18.561
that first piece of can and
place it inside the oscillator.

38:18.663 --> 38:20.730
At that point,
we're going to need

38:20.832 --> 38:22.298
someone to turn this thing
on and...

38:22.400 --> 38:23.833
We want Dan to do it.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.613
It'd be great if Dan,
his dad, could be part of it.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.847
- Would be great.
- That'd be wonderful.

38:26.871 --> 38:29.705
- Let's do it.
- Here we are right here.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.941
All ready to go.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.609
He's all geared up.

38:36.681 --> 38:38.881
<i>Now that the final
piece of equipment,</i>

38:38.983 --> 38:41.684
<i>known as the oscillator,
has arrived,</i>

38:41.786 --> 38:44.954
<i>it will be used to slowly
grind a number of massive,</i>

38:45.056 --> 38:48.357
<i>60 foot-long steel caissons
into the ground</i>

38:48.460 --> 38:51.294
<i>above the team's first target:</i>

38:51.396 --> 38:56.766
<i>A possible wooden box known as
the Chapel Vault.</i>

38:56.868 --> 39:01.370
<i>Once located, some 140 feet
deep underground,</i>

39:01.473 --> 39:04.974
<i>and eight ton excavating tool
called a Hammer Grab,</i>

39:05.043 --> 39:08.411
<i>will then remove the earth, and
hopefully treasure,</i>

39:08.480 --> 39:11.581
<i>from inside the 40-inch
wide hole.</i>

39:13.718 --> 39:15.062
So right now they
have the starter can

39:15.086 --> 39:16.086
suspended in the air.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.721
That can's about 30,000 pounds.

39:18.823 --> 39:21.557
That's the oscillating portion
of it?

39:21.659 --> 39:23.359
Yes, so there's the teeth
on the bottom,

39:23.461 --> 39:25.895
that's going to go down and
start cutting the earth.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.598
So you'll see the guys
right now, they have the leads

39:28.700 --> 39:30.340
and they're just guiding the can
right in.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.651
Looks like we're ready to go,
you guys ready?

39:54.692 --> 39:56.792
- We're ready.
- We were born ready.

39:56.895 --> 39:57.895
Let's do it.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.562
Time to let the big dog eat.

39:59.664 --> 40:02.431
Come on, Dan. Show us your
stuff!

40:02.534 --> 40:06.469
Daniel, this is Kent.
He's a big fan of yours.

40:06.571 --> 40:07.837
Mr. Blankenship.

40:07.939 --> 40:09.739
What a, what a pleasure.
What a pleasure, sir.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.986
What I do with a big iron like
this and see a man do it bare

40:12.010 --> 40:14.610
handed and with just as hard,
it's pretty neat, brother.

40:14.712 --> 40:15.845
We didn't do it bare handed,

40:15.947 --> 40:17.313
we had a pick and a shovel.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.716
All right, if you're ready.

40:20.818 --> 40:22.596
Dan, if you can go ahead and
turn that on for us,

40:22.620 --> 40:24.687
please, sir?

40:24.789 --> 40:25.988
- Beautiful.
- All right.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.723
We've got the stage set,

40:27.825 --> 40:30.459
the gear is set,
the players are set.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.328
- It's go time.
- All at the same time.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.896
- All at the same time.
- Here we go!

40:33.998 --> 40:36.599
One... two... three...

40:36.701 --> 40:38.901
Make hole!

40:39.003 --> 40:40.536
Here we go.

40:40.638 --> 40:45.474
- Heading down, Dan.
- Digging, digging.

40:45.577 --> 40:48.344
- That's it!
- Yes sir, yes sir.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.946
Good day!

40:50.048 --> 40:52.982
<i>For Rick, Marty, and the team,</i>

40:53.084 --> 40:56.686
<i>the hope of a great discovery
and possible answers</i>

40:56.754 --> 40:59.555
<i>to the Oak Island mystery has
never been higher.</i>

40:59.657 --> 41:01.724
All right, slamming can.

41:01.826 --> 41:05.294
<i>But once they reach
their targets deep underground,</i>

41:05.396 --> 41:06.963
<i>what will they find?</i>

41:07.065 --> 41:10.032
<i>A chest full of untold
riches in treasure?</i>

41:10.134 --> 41:14.470
<i>A vault filled with priceless
religious objects?</i>

41:14.572 --> 41:18.007
<i>Or will it be something
even more incredible</i>

41:18.109 --> 41:20.776
<i>and mysterious
than anything they,</i>

41:20.878 --> 41:25.114
<i>or anyone living, could ever
have imagined?</i>

41:28.953 --> 41:31.687
<i>Next time...
on The Curse of Oak Island...</i>

41:31.789 --> 41:33.689
Here we are, digging
in the Money Pit.

41:33.791 --> 41:36.058
Nothing like this has been done
since 1801.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.628
- Wait 'til we hit something.
- You better believe it.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.930
The treasure of Tumbes
is the biggest

41:41.032 --> 41:42.598
missing treasure of gold.

41:42.700 --> 41:43.799
I think it's on Oak Island.

41:43.901 --> 41:45.635
This could be the year, Dan.

41:45.737 --> 41:48.004
We're poised on the vault.
How prophetic is that?

41:48.106 --> 41:49.839
We're feet away from what

41:49.941 --> 41:51.907
we've labored for,
for eight years.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.843
- Come on, baby.
- Wood!

41:53.945 --> 41:55.511
- Ho!
- Wood!

41:55.613 --> 41:57.046
Well, I'll be damned.
