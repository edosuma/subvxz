13:54.792 --> 13:56.794
[grunts] That was awesome!

13:56.877 --> 13:58.045
Sorry, little guy.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.799
Wow! I'm glad DJ Drone
wasn't here to see that.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.594
Two minutes until Skeleton Key
is ready to launch worldwide.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.270
How much longer, Frostee?

14:15.604 --> 14:16.605
I'm ready to go.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.858
But Shashi is on top of a building,
and you'll only have ten seconds

14:19.942 --> 14:22.361
to get to him and take down Skeleton Key!

14:22.528 --> 14:24.905
So... how are you gonna do that?

14:25.155 --> 14:26.782
[Tony] I think I just found a ramp.

14:29.785 --> 14:30.786
Whoa!

14:35.583 --> 14:37.793
Guys, I got a little missile problem here.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.424
[yelling]

14:45.384 --> 14:46.552
I can't shake it!

14:46.635 --> 14:48.762
[Layla] Wahoo-hoo!

14:49.972 --> 14:51.849
-Layla!
-[Layla] I got the missile.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.225
Now, finish this!

15:01.734 --> 15:05.112
Layla! Are you all right?
Does anyone have eyes on Layla?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.365
Skeleton Key is linked
into the West Coast grid.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.284
We're ready to launch worldwide, Shashi.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.913
I could do this all day, but sadly,
I have other business to handle.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.040
Goodbye, Cleve.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.000
Fire up the transmitter.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.045
[whirring]

15:21.128 --> 15:23.130
[electrical crackling]

15:25.257 --> 15:26.884
You got ten seconds, T!

15:27.134 --> 15:28.761
Good thing I have a ten-second car.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.890
What's happening?

15:33.891 --> 15:35.184
Jun, I've lost power.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.311
Someone is transmitting a virus!

15:37.645 --> 15:39.396
I'll have it handled in just a second.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.522
[cackling]

15:41.106 --> 15:42.358
Nice one, Frostee.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.446
Really wish I hadn't yanked out
that electric rocket ignition.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.882
No way.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.425
[gasps]

16:13.013 --> 16:14.264
Wahoo-hoo!

16:14.348 --> 16:16.225
Yeah! Did you see that?

16:16.308 --> 16:17.393
[panting]

16:19.687 --> 16:22.439
-[beep]
-Got it! Shashi, you're back online.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.525
[Shashi and Tony grunting]

16:27.486 --> 16:28.779
[screams]

16:28.862 --> 16:29.905
No, no, no, no, no!

16:30.406 --> 16:31.657
[yells]

16:35.995 --> 16:36.829
[chuckles]

16:40.082 --> 16:41.166
[yells]

16:43.460 --> 16:45.004
Let's see what this thing can do.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.849
[Shashi gasps]

16:57.975 --> 16:58.976
[gasps]

16:59.059 --> 17:00.477
[panting]

17:01.979 --> 17:02.980
[grunts]

17:04.773 --> 17:06.191
Nowhere to hide, Shashi.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.743
[whimpering]

17:20.748 --> 17:22.249
This is how you took out Layla.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.335
Hiding behind a mask,
letting machines do your dirty work.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.214
Get up. Let's finish this, Toretto-style.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.428
[both yelling]

17:34.511 --> 17:36.597
Shashi! Shashi, come in!

17:39.808 --> 17:40.809
[grunts]

17:40.893 --> 17:42.895
-[knuckles crack]
-Hack that.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.607
Come on! What's the hold up here?
Let's blow this old gal!

17:48.150 --> 17:50.069
See you later, Shashi.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.445
[cackles]

17:51.779 --> 17:53.072
[grunting continues]

18:05.209 --> 18:07.878
-That was a heck of a punch! [gasps]
-[rumbling]

18:10.631 --> 18:11.882
[gasps]

18:11.965 --> 18:15.177
[Frostee on radio]  Tony!
The building you're in is exploding!

18:15.844 --> 18:16.929
I noticed!

18:17.012 --> 18:18.555
[panting]

18:19.723 --> 18:23.018
If we make it out of here alive,
I'm gonna knock you out all over again.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.606
-[Frostee]  Get out of there, T!
-How?

18:33.070 --> 18:35.823
Hey, if Dom can do it, so can I.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.324
[engine revving]

18:39.493 --> 18:40.828
[tires squeal]

18:40.911 --> 18:42.412
[revving hard]

18:46.834 --> 18:48.377
[screaming continues]

18:51.672 --> 18:53.257
He's not gonna make it!

18:56.510 --> 18:58.637
No, no, no, no, no! [whimpers]

18:59.179 --> 19:01.348
[whimpers]

19:01.431 --> 19:03.142
[panting]

19:04.518 --> 19:06.937
Are you seeing this?
Is anyone seeing this?

19:07.312 --> 19:09.398
I can't believe I'm seeing this.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.741
[sighs]

19:20.325 --> 19:22.703
-Look who dropped in.
-Dom?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.998
Didn't anyone ever tell you
cars don't fly?

19:27.833 --> 19:30.127
Dom, what are you doing here?

19:30.460 --> 19:32.462
You know I'm always there for family.

19:33.088 --> 19:33.922
Thanks.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.883
I always wanted to be just like you.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.594
I guess I didn't realize
what that really meant.

19:38.927 --> 19:41.680
But you stepped up and finished the job.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.348
And I'm proud of you.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.982
-[tires squeal]
-[gasps] Layla! You're alive!

19:53.192 --> 19:54.985
[grunts] Of course I am.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.780
You're the one who needed saving... again.

19:59.781 --> 20:03.160
-You really tore things up here.
-Yeah, this was pretty fun.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.370
I've never been to Vegas before.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.373
After this, you might not be invited back.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.043
So, Shashi's gonna be
locked up for a while.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.922
What are you gonna do now? I could talk
to Ms. Nowhere about the prison thing.

20:15.005 --> 20:18.008
What, are-are you recruiting me
to join your little spy squad?

20:18.217 --> 20:21.386
Yeah, why not? You get to travel around,
play with cool spy stuff.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.597
What did I tell you, Toretto?

20:23.680 --> 20:24.973
I'm a lone wolf.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.976
I better get out of here
before someone remembers to arrest me.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.646
See you around, Toretto.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.610
Later, Gray.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.696
Looks like Cleve managed to get away
in all the chaos.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.657
But don't worry, we'll find him.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.451
Any chance
we'll find Skeleton Key in there?

20:44.534 --> 20:47.120
[Tony] Doubt it.
I think only Shashi and I survived.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.664
[Nowhere] Probably for the best.

20:48.747 --> 20:49.957
It was too powerful.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.833
That thing in the wrong hands...

20:53.210 --> 20:55.379
Yeah. Imagine.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.136
Gary, where did you park our plane?

21:04.137 --> 21:05.222
It was right here.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.182
Uh... Look.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.480
Toretto! Don't you do it!

21:14.314 --> 21:15.565
[Tony] Sorry!

21:26.702 --> 21:27.536
[slurping]

21:27.619 --> 21:29.288
[Echo] Wahoo! That's right!

21:29.621 --> 21:31.707
-Whoo!
-[Tony] Yeah!

21:33.542 --> 21:36.795
[chuckles] Ms. Nowhere is probably
calling in a missile strike on us,

21:36.878 --> 21:38.130
like, right now.

21:38.213 --> 21:39.339
She'll be fine.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.009
-We deserve a little vacation.
-Yeah.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.469
We'll give Skeleton Key
and the plane back next week.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.179
But first, I was thinking,

21:46.263 --> 21:49.516
maybe we could hop over to Japan
and visit the Yoka factory?

21:49.975 --> 21:52.185
I hear they have
all kinds of crazy flavors,

21:52.269 --> 21:55.522
like lychee and seaweed
and platinum tiger.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.108
A lap around the islands
before we hit the road?

21:58.400 --> 21:59.401
