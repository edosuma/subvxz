WEBVTT

00:04.967 --> 00:06.367
- [sighs]

00:06.367 --> 00:07.900
COME ON!

00:07.900 --> 00:09.233
- YEAH, YEAH.

00:09.233 --> 00:10.833
LISTEN, YOU BEAT ME
BY A FEW STROKES, OKAY?

00:10.833 --> 00:12.433
THAT'S ONLY 'CAUSE
MY BACK WAS ACTIN' UP.

00:12.433 --> 00:14.167
- YOUR BACK.
YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS?

00:14.167 --> 00:16.100
'CAUSE YOUR NOSE
THROWS YOU OFF BALANCE.

00:19.333 --> 00:20.967
- RAY, LOOK AT THIS.

00:20.967 --> 00:23.733
WHY DO YOU TELL YOUR FATHER
WHEN THINGS ARE BROKEN?

00:23.733 --> 00:25.067
ALL HE DOES IS COME OVER,

00:25.067 --> 00:29.133
BANG ON THE THING,
AND THEN CURSE.

00:29.133 --> 00:31.400
- THAT'S--THAT'S
OLD-MAN AEROBICS.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.567
- YOU KNOW, HE SAID HE'D
FIX THIS STUPID THING,

00:34.567 --> 00:35.967
AND NOW I CAN'T EVEN
GET IT TO LIGHT.

00:35.967 --> 00:37.667
AND IT'S LEAKING GAS.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.167
- YOU WANTME
TO CHECK IT OUT, DEB?

00:39.167 --> 00:40.600
- WHAT--NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'LL LOOK AT IT.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.400
- OR YOU COULD LET
A PROFESSIONAL CONTRACTOR

00:42.400 --> 00:44.333
WHO'S NOT A MORON
LOOK AT IT.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.100
- I-I DON'T WANNA
PUT YOU TO WORK, GIANNI.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.600
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.800
MAN, THIS THING IS OLD!

00:50.800 --> 00:53.467
- HEY, EASY.
SHE'S STANDIN' RIGHT THERE.

00:53.467 --> 00:54.833
HA HA HA!

00:54.833 --> 00:56.300
YEAH.

00:58.700 --> 01:00.000
YOU SEE WHAT I DID?
I TOOK WHAT HE SAID--

01:00.000 --> 01:02.133
- WE NEED A NEW STOVE, RAY.

01:02.133 --> 01:04.633
- NO. NO, LOOK,
IF MY FATHER SAID HE FIXED IT,

01:04.633 --> 01:05.933
HE FIXED IT, RIGHT?

01:05.933 --> 01:07.667
COME ON.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.633
[grunts]

01:14.433 --> 01:18.800
OKAY, SEE, THIS IS GOOD,
'CAUSE YOU CAN MAKE SOUP

01:18.800 --> 01:23.500
OR GO HOT AIR BALLOONING.

01:24.667 --> 01:29.233
ALL RIGHT.
[grunts]

01:29.233 --> 01:32.400
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
CAN YOU GET US A REPLACEMENT?

01:32.400 --> 01:35.233
- FOR THIS?
YEAH, JUMP IN A TIME MACHINE

01:35.233 --> 01:38.600
AND BUY ONE
OFF A PILGRIM.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.300
- YOU KNOW, GIANNI,
WHILE WE'RE AT IT,

01:40.300 --> 01:41.533
I WAS THINKING...

01:41.533 --> 01:43.200
I WANTED TO PUT A MICROWAVE
UP HERE.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.400
- W-WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WEGOT A MICROWAVE.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.367
- NO, THAT MAKES SENSE, DEB.
YOU GET SOME COUNTER SPACE--

01:47.367 --> 01:49.333
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING.
- YEAH.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.200
IT'LL BE
A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE--

01:51.200 --> 01:54.033
- HEY! SHUT UP.

01:54.033 --> 01:55.700
- RAY, DON'T WORRY.
WHATEVER YOU DO,

01:55.700 --> 01:57.533
I'LL GET YOU THE EQUIPMENT
AT COST.

01:57.533 --> 01:59.067
IF YOU WANT,
I'LL DO THE JOB MYSELF.

01:59.067 --> 02:00.167
- OH, LET'S DO IT!

02:00.167 --> 02:01.600
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.833
MY FATHER--HE'S GONNA
GO NUTS HERE, OKAY?

02:02.833 --> 02:04.100
HE LIKES TO FIX THINGS.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.600
I MEAN...
WHAT AM I GONNA TELL HIM?

02:05.600 --> 02:07.333
- GIANNI, WHILE YOU'RE OUT
GETTING A STOVE,

02:07.333 --> 02:12.133
COULD YOU PICK UP
A SPINE FOR MY HUSBAND?

02:12.133 --> 02:13.600
- WHY DON'T I JUST
GET YOU A NEW HUSBAND?

02:13.600 --> 02:15.667
'CAUSE I KNOW
THISONE'S LEAKING GAS.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.000
- HI, DEARS.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.700
- HI.
- OH, HEY.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.567
- HI, MRS. B, MR. B.

02:35.567 --> 02:37.800
- OH, HI.
- HI THERE, GIANNI.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.233
WHATCHA DOIN'?

02:41.133 --> 02:42.933
- I'M JUST...

02:42.933 --> 02:44.667
RAY,
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM?

02:45.800 --> 02:47.533
- TELL ME WHAT?

02:47.533 --> 02:49.367
WHAT'S GIANNI DOIN'
WITH THE STOVE?

02:52.067 --> 02:55.133
- JUST TELL HIM, RAY.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.300
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.733
WH-WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:03.733 --> 03:05.167
- IT IS WEIRD.

03:05.167 --> 03:06.600
WHAT ARE YOU MOVING THE STOVE
AROUND FOR?

03:09.967 --> 03:11.500
- YOU WANT ME TO GO?

03:11.500 --> 03:14.567
- NO, NO. LOOK...
IT'S NO BIGGIE.

03:14.567 --> 03:16.100
I MEAN,
WE'RE GETTING A NEW STOVE,

03:16.100 --> 03:18.367
AND GIANNI'S HELPING US
PUT IT IN.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.133
- WHAT?

03:20.133 --> 03:24.700
- IT'S...IT'S NO BIGGIE.

03:27.533 --> 03:28.467
IT'S--YOU KNOW,

03:28.467 --> 03:30.233
IT'S--THE STOVE IS...

03:30.233 --> 03:32.033
LATELY,
THIS ONE HAS BEEN...

03:32.033 --> 03:34.633
TRYIN' TO KILL US.

03:34.633 --> 03:37.600
- I TOLD YOU
I STILL HAD TO TWEAK IT!

03:37.600 --> 03:39.567
- I-I KNOW, BUT IT HAS
A LOT OF PROBLEMS, FRANK.

03:39.567 --> 03:42.767
I MEAN, MOST OF THE TIME,
I CAN BARELY USE IT.

03:42.767 --> 03:47.500
- OH, DEAR.
CAN WE REALLY BLAME THE STOVE?

03:51.867 --> 03:53.167
- WHOA, WHOA.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.300
THIS BILL'S
GONNA COST 2 GRAND?

03:55.300 --> 03:58.800
WHAT KIND OF SCREW JOB
IS THIS?

03:58.800 --> 03:59.933
- OH, FRANK...

03:59.933 --> 04:01.633
GIANNI'S A GOOD BOY.

04:01.633 --> 04:05.867
HE WOULDN'T GIVE US
A SCREW JOB.

04:05.867 --> 04:07.600
- THANKS, MRS. B.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.967
AND IT'S GONNA BE
CLOSER TO 1,500.

04:09.967 --> 04:11.467
- NUTS!

04:11.467 --> 04:12.900
I CAN GET THIS THING
BACK IN SHAPE

04:12.900 --> 04:14.267
IN FIVE MINUTES,

04:14.267 --> 04:15.800
AND ALL IT'LL COST YOU
IS LUNCH.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.600
CHICKEN CROQUETTES I LIKE.

04:23.533 --> 04:25.300
- FRANK,
IF YOU WANNA FIX SOMETHING,

04:25.300 --> 04:26.867
WHY DON'T YOU
GO FIX OUR GARAGE DOOR

04:26.867 --> 04:29.533
THAT I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT
FOR SIX YEARS?

04:29.533 --> 04:31.200
- I WILL NOT DO THAT
ON PRINCIPLE.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.467
IT WOULD ONLY PROVE
NAGGING WORKS.

04:35.767 --> 04:38.100
- FINE.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.700
GIANNI,
WHEN YOU FINISH HERE,

04:39.700 --> 04:41.967
CAN YOU COME LOOK
AT OUR GARAGE DOOR?

04:41.967 --> 04:44.333
- YOU STAY AWAY FROM THAT.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.667
I PUT TEN YEARS OF SWEAT
INTO THIS HOUSE,

04:46.667 --> 04:48.500
AND THIS IS MY THANKS?

04:48.500 --> 04:51.633
YOU HIRE SOME OUTSIDE YAHOO
WHEN I'M NOT LOOKIN'?

04:51.633 --> 04:53.900
- DAD, COME ON.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.300
- EXCUSE ME.
I MAY BE A YAHOO,

04:56.300 --> 04:58.467
BUT I'M A LICENSED
AND BONDED YAHOO.

04:58.467 --> 05:00.267
AND I'M NOT SOME
HARDWARE STORE GROUPIE

05:00.267 --> 05:02.533
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE.

05:05.367 --> 05:09.200
- ARE YOU CALLING ME
"A LOT OF PEOPLE"?

05:09.200 --> 05:13.133
- DAD, DAD. CALM IT--
CALM IT DOWN, DAD.

05:13.133 --> 05:14.833
- WHAT, YOU LET HIM
TALK TO ME LIKE THAT?

05:14.833 --> 05:18.167
I'M THE GRANDPA
OF YOUR FREAKIN' CHILDREN!

05:18.167 --> 05:20.867
- WE KNOW, WE KNOW!

05:33.600 --> 05:34.800

05:34.800 --> 05:36.100

05:36.100 --> 05:38.633
GIANNI'S YOUR FIX-IT GUY NOW.

05:38.633 --> 05:41.133
CALL HIM "DAD."

05:44.367 --> 05:47.300
- THAT'S NOT
SUCH A TERRIBLE OFFER.

05:53.433 --> 05:58.533
- HEY.

05:58.533 --> 05:59.933
WHAT'S UP?
MY FATHER COME BY AT ALL?

05:59.933 --> 06:01.500
- NOT YET.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.700
- FOUR WHOLE DAYS,
AND HE'S STILL MAD AT US?

06:02.700 --> 06:03.833
- YUP.

06:03.833 --> 06:06.367
- CAN'T BE DOIN'
MY MOTHER ANY GOOD.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.267
OH, BY THE WAY,
YOU KNOW HOW YOU TOLD ME

06:08.267 --> 06:10.500
THAT AMY ALSO WANTS
SOME KITCHEN RENOVATION CRAP?

06:10.500 --> 06:12.100
- YEAH.
- SO I RECOMMENDED GIANNI

06:12.100 --> 06:14.600
TO HER.
- BUT--

06:14.600 --> 06:15.667
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.300
ROBERT'S GONNA GET
ALL WEIRDED OUT

06:17.300 --> 06:18.567
BECAUSE AMY AND GIANNI
DATED ONCE OR TWICE,

06:18.567 --> 06:20.400
BUT...
HE'S GOTTA GET OVER IT.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.567
HE'S SUCH A DOPE.

06:23.567 --> 06:26.133
- YOU KNOW...

06:26.133 --> 06:27.833
I'M NOT SURE THAT...

06:27.833 --> 06:32.133
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY...

06:32.133 --> 06:35.333
RECOMMEND GIANNI.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.567
- WHAT?
- WELL...

06:37.567 --> 06:38.867
[sighs]

06:38.867 --> 06:42.733
THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS
THAT GIANNI KIND OF...

06:42.733 --> 06:45.933
I HATE HIM.

06:45.933 --> 06:49.300
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

06:49.300 --> 06:51.400
- N-NOT AS A PERSON,
BUT...

06:51.400 --> 06:54.633
AS A PERSON
IN MY HOUSE.

06:54.633 --> 06:55.933
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYIN'?

06:55.933 --> 06:57.267
HE'S NOT DOING A GOOD JOB?

06:57.267 --> 06:59.700
- I'M SAYIN' HE STINKS.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.100
- LIKE HE SMELLS?

07:02.100 --> 07:04.000
- NO, HE STINKS AT HIS JOB.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.733
AND, BY THE WAY,
HE DOES SMELL A LITTLE.

07:06.733 --> 07:09.267
- WELL, THAT'S A--
A MANLY SMELL

07:09.267 --> 07:10.667
YOU GET FROM WORKING
WITH YOUR BODY.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.333
OKAY? UH...
WHAT DO YOU WANT,

07:12.333 --> 07:14.500
A CONTRACTOR THAT SMELLS
LIKE A CINNAMON BUN?

07:16.467 --> 07:18.800
- YOU KNOW, GIANNI
SHOULD BE DONE BY NOW,

07:18.800 --> 07:20.700
AND HE'S NOT
BECAUSE HE'S LAZY.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.600
I MEAN, HALF THE TIME,
HE'S ON HIS PHONE,

07:22.600 --> 07:24.167
AND HE BRINGS
HIS OWN LITTLE TV,

07:24.167 --> 07:25.767
AND IT PLAYS ALL DAY.

07:25.767 --> 07:27.033
LOOK AT--

07:27.033 --> 07:28.333
YOU SEE THAT SCUFF MARK
ON THE FLOOR?

07:28.333 --> 07:29.767
HE DRAGGED THE STOVE OUT

07:29.767 --> 07:31.733
WHILE HE WAS WATCHING
"THE PRICE IS RIGHT."

07:31.733 --> 07:34.233
- ALL RIGHT. SO, I'M SURE
IF YOU TOLD HIM THAT--

07:34.233 --> 07:36.267
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE
THAT GAME SHOW--

07:36.267 --> 07:38.767
- IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE SHOW, RAY!

07:40.200 --> 07:41.633
YOU KNOW,
IT'S BEEN FOUR DAYS,

07:41.633 --> 07:44.033
AND HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE IT
DONE IN TWO, TOPS.

07:44.033 --> 07:46.767
- OKAY, SO?
SO IT'S TWO EXTRA DAYS.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.300
- YEAH, SO I CAN'T
USE MY KITCHEN

07:48.300 --> 07:50.267
BECAUSE I HAVE NO STOVE!

07:50.267 --> 07:51.767
- WELL, OKAY, BUT...

07:51.767 --> 07:55.333
IT'S NOT LIKE
VAN GOGH LOST HIS PAINTBRUSH.

07:59.833 --> 08:01.767
I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT!

08:01.767 --> 08:03.333
I JUST...HEY.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.233
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO PICKED GIANNI.

08:05.233 --> 08:07.667
- YES, I PICKED HIM,
AND I MADE A MISTAKE.

08:07.667 --> 08:11.433
IT WON'T BE THE FIRST TIME
I PICK THE WRONG GUY.

08:11.433 --> 08:12.667
- COME ON!

08:12.667 --> 08:14.667
HE'S DOING THIS
AS A FAVOR, AND--

08:14.667 --> 08:17.567
- RAY, IT'S NOT A FAVOR
IF YOU'RE PAYIN' THE PERSON.

08:17.567 --> 08:19.867
LOOK, IF HE'S NOT DONE
BY TOMORROW,

08:19.867 --> 08:21.600
I'M UN-PICKING HIM.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.200
- WH-WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:23.200 --> 08:24.400
WE CAN'T FIRE HIM.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.100
- NO, YOU'REFIRING HIM.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.733
- WHAT?
- YEAH, 'CAUSE HE'S YOUR FRIEND.

08:28.733 --> 08:31.533
- THAT'S RIGHT!
SO WE CAN'T FIRE HIM.

08:31.533 --> 08:32.700
- WE HAVE TO.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.267
WE HAVE TO LET HIM GO.

08:34.267 --> 08:36.100
- OKAY, SO IF IT'S "WE,"

08:36.100 --> 08:38.133
THEN YOU NEED
MY SAY-SO, OKAY?

08:38.133 --> 08:40.733
YOU NEED MY SAY-SO
IF IT'S "WE."

08:40.733 --> 08:43.500
MY SAY-SO!

08:43.500 --> 08:47.300
- I DON'T NEED YOUR SAY-SO.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.300
- YES, YOU DO SO!

08:49.300 --> 08:52.900
YOU DO SO NEED MY SAY-SO!

08:52.900 --> 08:54.400
LET HIM GO.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.433
MAYBE I'LL
LET SOMEBODY ELSE GO.

08:57.433 --> 08:58.233
- WHAT?

09:08.400 --> 09:11.133
- HEY, DEB.
- HEY, GIANNI.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.133
- HEY, HEY!

09:13.133 --> 09:15.800
HEY, HEY, HEY!

09:15.800 --> 09:18.533
HEY, MAN. WHAT'S UP?

09:18.533 --> 09:21.133
YEAH. HOW'S IT GOIN'?

09:21.133 --> 09:22.433
- I'M GOOD.

09:22.433 --> 09:23.800
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

09:23.800 --> 09:25.333
- NO PROBLEM, NO.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.900
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.
JUST PSYCHED, MAN.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.367
GET TO HANG OUT,
YOU KNOW,

09:28.367 --> 09:30.333
WHILE YOU WORK
AND DEBRA STAYS IN THERE.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.800
- OKAY.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.133
LISTEN, GOOD NEWS.

09:33.133 --> 09:34.533
- WHAT?
- IT'S HERE.

09:34.533 --> 09:38.833
- OH. OH!
WOW, LOOK AT THIS!

09:38.833 --> 09:39.833
- THERE YOU GO!

09:39.833 --> 09:41.600
- YEAH, THAT IS A BEAUTY!

09:41.600 --> 09:43.600
I LOVE THAT.
- IT'S HERE.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.000
I ENDED UP ORDERING
THROUGH A DIFFERENT GUY,

09:45.000 --> 09:46.233
SO IT TOOK A LITTLE LONGER.

09:46.233 --> 09:47.900
BUT YOU SAVED SOME GREEN.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.700
- OH. TOOK A LITTLE LONGER...

09:49.700 --> 09:51.767
BUT SAVED SOME GREEN.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.600
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, DEBRA?
YOU LIKE IT?

09:54.600 --> 09:55.833
- OH, IT'S GREAT, GIANNI.
THANKS.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.300
I CAN'T BELIEVE

09:57.300 --> 09:59.600
TODAY'S THE DAY I ACTUALLY
GET TO USE IT.

10:01.933 --> 10:03.533
- YEAH.
THIS IS GREAT, MAN.

10:03.533 --> 10:06.200
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
LET'S HOOK THIS BAD BOY UP.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.133
- YEAH. HEY, YOU HUNGRY?

10:09.133 --> 10:11.100
'CAUSE I CAN GO

10:13.633 --> 10:16.767
["The Price is Right"
theme song playing]

10:19.633 --> 10:21.667
- YEAH. ME TOO, ME TOO.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.533
YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE
A BETTER IDEA?

10:23.533 --> 10:25.233
MAYBE TO PUT
THE STOVE IN FIRST.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.400
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I'M JUST

10:27.400 --> 10:30.067
SO DAMN EXCITED
TO GET THIS BAD BOY HOOKED UP.

10:30.067 --> 10:31.400
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST
PUT THIS IN,

10:31.400 --> 10:32.733
AND THEN I'LL MAKE YOU
A STEAK?

10:32.733 --> 10:36.700
A NICE, HOT STOVE STEAK.
- STOVE STEAK?

10:36.700 --> 10:38.533
- YEAH. WHY--WHAT,
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

10:38.533 --> 10:41.067
YOU PUT THE STOVE IN,
AND I'LL SHOW YA.

10:45.033 --> 10:47.733
PUT THE STOVE IN.

10:49.867 --> 10:51.467
- ALL RIGHT!

10:51.467 --> 10:52.367
SIT DOWN.

10:52.367 --> 10:54.200
ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO.

11:38.600 --> 11:42.700
OKAY.
- WHAT?

11:42.700 --> 11:45.967
- YOU GOT A LITTLE
SPACE PROBLEM.

11:45.967 --> 11:47.733
- WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:47.733 --> 11:49.100
YOU MEASURED IT, RIGHT?

11:49.100 --> 11:51.267
- YEAH. IT'S JUST
A LITTLE TOO TIGHT.

11:51.267 --> 11:53.333
I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ORDER NEW CABINETS.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.900
I COULD PROBABLY
GET 'EM HERE SOMETIME NEXT WEEK.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.467
- NEXT WEEK?

11:56.467 --> 11:58.300
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
I'M SURE IT'LL FIT.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.033
MAYBE WE JUST GOTTA--
WE GOTTA WIGGLE IT A LITTLE.

12:00.033 --> 12:01.333
GRAB THAT SIDE,
WE'LL WIGGLE IT.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.133
- RAY, YOU CAN'T WIGGLE--

12:03.133 --> 12:04.900
- LET'S JUST TRY!
TRY--GRAB THAT SIDE.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.400
- LOOK, I SAID I'LL
TAKE CARE OF IT NEXT WEEK.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.633
- ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE--

12:08.633 --> 12:10.200
- NO, NO, NO.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.267
THIS IS GONNA FIT IN.

12:11.267 --> 12:12.367
YOU JUST GOTTA...

12:12.367 --> 12:14.433

YOU HURT YOUR BACK!

12:26.233 --> 12:28.933
LET ME SEE.
- OW, OW, OW, OW!

12:28.933 --> 12:30.467
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

12:30.467 --> 12:33.600
- DOCTOR SAID I GOTTA JUST STAY
IN BED A COUPLE DAYS.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.667
- GOOD. WE'RE REALLY GONNA
CLEAN UP ON THIS LAWSUIT.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.267
- DAD, I TOLD YOU.

12:38.267 --> 12:39.667
IT'S NOT GIANNI'S FAULT.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.600
- HEY, WE'RE GONNA
WIN THIS CASE.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.667
I WANT A CAMARO.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.500
- HUSH UP.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.833
SWEETIE...

12:47.833 --> 12:49.167
YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW

12:49.167 --> 12:51.500
YOU'RE NOT A MAN
WHO CAN LIFT THINGS.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.767
- HI!

12:55.767 --> 12:58.067
- HI.
- HI, RAY.

12:58.067 --> 13:00.367
WE JUST WANTED
TO STOP BY AND SAY HI.

13:00.367 --> 13:01.567
- AND SOME OTHER THINGS.

13:01.567 --> 13:03.067
- ROBERT...

13:03.067 --> 13:04.267
- LISTEN, MAN,
WHAT WERE YOU THINKIN'

13:04.267 --> 13:05.833
WHEN YOU RECOMMENDED GIANNI?

13:05.833 --> 13:07.367
YOU KNOW HE RIPPED OUT OUR SINK
AND HASN'T COME BACK?

13:07.367 --> 13:10.867
I'M WASHING PLATES
IN THE BATHTUB.

13:10.867 --> 13:13.800
- GOOD, 'CAUSE NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT A BATHTUB LOOKS LIKE.

13:13.800 --> 13:14.967
- [laughs]

13:14.967 --> 13:18.833
- HA HA--OW, OW, OW!

13:18.833 --> 13:20.767
OW...IT HURTS WHEN I LAUGH.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.100
- OH, REALLY?

13:24.067 --> 13:27.700
HURTS WHEN YOU LAUGH,
HUH?

13:29.333 --> 13:31.533
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

13:33.733 --> 13:35.333
SERIOUSLY, MAN.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.933
STOP IT.

13:36.933 --> 13:38.400
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.167
- WHO'S--WHO'S MAKING
ANYBODY LAUGH?

13:41.167 --> 13:42.267
- I MEAN IT.

13:42.267 --> 13:43.733
JUST STOP IT!

13:43.733 --> 13:45.400
STOP IT!

13:45.400 --> 13:48.033
OW!

13:48.033 --> 13:49.967
- I'M NOT DOIN' ANYTHING.

13:49.967 --> 13:51.300
- OW!

13:51.300 --> 13:53.433
- ROBERT, GET YOUR FACE
AWAY FROM YOUR BROTHER!

13:53.433 --> 13:55.333
- OW!

13:55.333 --> 13:57.133
- THAT'S FOR RECOMMENDING
GIANNI!

13:57.133 --> 13:58.567
- HEY, LUNKHEAD,

13:58.567 --> 13:59.833
IT'S YOUR FAULT
FOR HIRING THAT CLOWN

13:59.833 --> 14:01.000
WHEN YOU ALREADY GOT ME!

14:01.000 --> 14:02.733
- I THOUGHT HE WAS
A PROFESSIONAL.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.000
- HE STINKS!

14:04.000 --> 14:05.767
LOOK AT MY LITTLE
CRIPPLED BOY!

14:08.733 --> 14:09.967
- DAD.

14:09.967 --> 14:11.833
- HE'S PATHETIC.
LOOK AT HIM.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.933
THAT GIANNI'S A BUTCHER.

14:13.933 --> 14:16.400
I'M GETTING ME A CAMARO.

14:18.033 --> 14:20.000
- WHAT'S WORSE,
RAY KNEW GIANNI STINKS,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.433
BUT HE CHOSE TO KEEP IT A
SECRET, BECAUSE THEY'RE FRIENDS.

14:22.433 --> 14:24.100
- GIANNI DOESN'T STINK.

14:24.100 --> 14:25.400
- NO?
HMM.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.967
THAT'S INTERESTING,
BECAUSE I THINK

14:26.967 --> 14:28.400
THE VERY DEFINITION
OF A PERSON

14:28.400 --> 14:30.800
WHO STARTS A JOB
AND DOESN'T FINISH IT

14:30.800 --> 14:33.867
IS STINK...Y.

14:33.867 --> 14:38.200
STINKY.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.133
- ROBERT, I KNOW YOU'RE
UPSET WITH GIANNI, BUT--

14:40.133 --> 14:41.533
- DO YOU STILL
HAVE A THING FOR HIM?

14:41.533 --> 14:43.367
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
YOU GOT A THING?

14:44.500 --> 14:45.600
- NO!

14:45.600 --> 14:48.133
ROBERT, WE ONLY WENT OUT
FOR TWO WEEKS!

14:48.133 --> 14:50.433
- OH, SO NOW IT'S
TWO WEEKS?

14:50.433 --> 14:54.133
- HEY. HOW'S THE WORLD'S
STRONGEST MORON?

14:56.400 --> 14:59.467
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HAVING A VIEWING.

15:08.067 --> 15:12.233
- HELLO, GIANNI.

15:12.233 --> 15:14.267
- HI, GIANNI.

15:14.267 --> 15:16.167
WE WERE JUST GOING.

15:16.167 --> 15:18.267
HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER,
RAY.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.300
- OH. HEY, ROBERT,
GOOD NEWS.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.733
I SPOKE TO THE SINK PEOPLE.

15:23.733 --> 15:25.233
THEY SAID EVEN THOUGH
IT'S ON BACK ORDER,

15:25.233 --> 15:26.600
YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
BY THE END OF THE MONTH.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.400
- END OF THE MONTH?
- COME ON, ROBERT.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.433
- I JUST WANNA TALK TO HIM.
- NO, ROBERT. NO!

15:30.433 --> 15:33.633
- BECAUSE
HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND!

15:33.633 --> 15:35.800
- COME ON, FRANK.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.333
RAYMOND NEEDS TO REST.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.100
AND, GIANNI,
DON'T STAY TOO LONG.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.267
- YOU GOT IT, MRS. B.

15:40.267 --> 15:41.333
- HEY, MR. B.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.167
- SEE YOU IN COURT.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.667
- IS HE STILL MAD
ABOUT ME DOING THE KITCHEN?

15:47.667 --> 15:51.300
- OH...HE'S STILL MAD
SOCIETY MAKES HIM WEAR PANTS.

15:52.933 --> 15:55.167
- ANYWAY, I JUST CAME UP
TO TELL YOU I'M ALL DONE.

15:55.167 --> 15:56.567
I FIXED UP THE OLD STOVE

15:56.567 --> 15:58.233
AND PUT IT BACK IN
LIKE DEBRA ASKED.

15:58.233 --> 15:59.633
- OH, THANKS.

15:59.633 --> 16:01.667
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
UH, I'M GONNA GO.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.500
HERE'S THIS.
I'LL LET YOU REST.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.167
GET TO IT
WHENEVER YOU CAN.

16:05.167 --> 16:07.600
- $2,000?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.433
- YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE
MORE THAN I SAID

16:09.433 --> 16:11.267
JUST 'CAUSE OF ALL
THE EXTRA WORK.

16:11.267 --> 16:13.400
- EXTRA WORK?

16:13.400 --> 16:15.033
- YEAH, YOU KNOW.
TAKING THE NEW STOVE BACK,

16:15.033 --> 16:16.333
PUTTING THE OLD ONE IN

16:16.333 --> 16:17.667
'CAUSE YOUR WIFE
CHANGED HER MIND.

16:17.667 --> 16:22.133
BY THE WAY, I SEE
WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT HER.

16:22.133 --> 16:24.267
- WHAT?
- IT'S JUST LIKE YOU SAY--

16:24.267 --> 16:26.600
[quacks]
I'M TRYING TO WORK,

16:26.600 --> 16:28.233
SHE INTERRUPTS
EVERY FIVE MINUTES

16:28.233 --> 16:30.700
TO TELL ME
TO TURN DOWN MY TV.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.200
- LISTEN...

16:34.067 --> 16:38.000
[groans]

16:38.000 --> 16:39.700
UHH. UHH!

16:39.700 --> 16:40.933
UH...[clears throat]

16:40.933 --> 16:43.700
ORIGINALLY,
WASN'T THIS GONNA BE $1,500,

16:43.700 --> 16:47.867
AND...AND THAT
INCLUDED A NEW STOVE?

16:47.867 --> 16:49.333
- WELL, YEAH.

16:49.333 --> 16:52.067
BUT, LIKE I SAID,
YOUR WIFE CHANGED HER MIND.

16:52.067 --> 16:54.600
- I KNOW.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.767
BUT THAT'S 'CAUSE
THE STOVE DIDN'T FIT.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.267
- I KNOW.

17:03.267 --> 17:06.100
BUT I WAS GONNA
TAKE CARE OF IT.

17:07.667 --> 17:11.433
- I KNOW.

17:11.433 --> 17:13.467
BUT YOU SAID
YOU COULDN'T GET TO IT

17:13.467 --> 17:16.267
TILL NEXT WEEK.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.733
- I KNOW, BUT...

17:19.733 --> 17:22.900
SO WHAT?

17:22.900 --> 17:26.733
- SO...WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING

17:26.733 --> 17:28.600
THAT--THAT WOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED

17:28.600 --> 17:32.100
IF YOU HAD MEASURED THE CABINETS
RIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE

17:32.100 --> 17:33.333
INSTEAD OF--
- WAIT A MINUTE.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.800
YOU THINK THIS IS MY FAULT?

17:34.800 --> 17:36.233
- IT IS YOUR FAULT,

17:36.233 --> 17:38.233
AND--AND I'M NOT
PAYING FOR THIS BILL.

17:38.233 --> 17:40.300
- UH, YEAH, YOU ARE.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.800
- YOU'RE CHARGING ME
2,000 BUCKS,

17:41.800 --> 17:44.433
AND I GOT THE SAME EXACT KITCHEN
THAT I HAD BEFORE!

17:44.433 --> 17:46.100
- THIS BILL IS FOR MY TIME.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.700
I WAS HERE SIX DAYS.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.100
- SIX DAYS WATCHING
"COME ON DOW--!"

17:49.100 --> 17:52.600
OW!

17:52.600 --> 17:55.500
- SIX DAYS HAVING TO DEAL
WITH YOUR WHOLE FAMILY.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.900
- HEY, DON'T YOU SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT MY FAMILY.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.367
MY FAMILY IS TOTALLY GREAT!

18:01.867 --> 18:03.167
- YOU WOULDN'T PULL THIS

18:03.167 --> 18:04.467
WITH SOMEONE
WHO WASN'T YOUR FRIEND.

18:04.467 --> 18:05.733
- THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.567
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO SCREW ME--OW!

18:07.567 --> 18:08.800
- SCREW YOU?

18:08.800 --> 18:10.667
YOU'RE LUCKY YOUR ASS
IS IN A SLING, OR ELSE--

18:10.667 --> 18:12.733
- OR WHAT? WHAT?
YOU'D START A FIGHT WITH ME

18:12.733 --> 18:15.300
AND THEN NOT FINISH THE JOB?

18:17.100 --> 18:18.333
- YOU KNOW
WHAT'S INCREDIBLE?

18:18.333 --> 18:19.633
I GAVE YOU A BREAK.

18:19.633 --> 18:22.433
'CAUSE THAT BILL
SHOULD BE 3,000!

18:22.433 --> 18:25.300
- YEAH? WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH IT IS NOW?

18:25.300 --> 18:26.533
- THAT'S IT.

18:26.533 --> 18:27.967
DON'T EVER CALL ME
TO DO ANYTHING.

18:27.967 --> 18:29.867
WORK, GOLF, NOTHIN'!

18:29.867 --> 18:34.800
- GOOD, FINE! FINE.
DEBRA'S RIGHT, YOU DO SMELL!

18:34.800 --> 18:38.300
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
I SMELL?

18:38.300 --> 18:42.900
- YOU DO NOTHING, AND YET
SOMEHOW YOU WORK UP A SMELL.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.600
- WHAT?

18:44.600 --> 18:47.200
- HI, GIANNI.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.533
- DON'T WORRY.

18:48.533 --> 18:52.533
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SMELL ME ANYMORE.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.267
- WE STILL SMELL YA.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.967
WE STILL SMELL YA.
WE CAN STILL SMELL YOU.

18:58.967 --> 19:01.533
I STILL SMELL YOU.

19:03.067 --> 19:05.767
- WHY DID YOU TELL HIM
I SAID THAT?

19:05.767 --> 19:08.133
- BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

19:08.133 --> 19:11.767
LOOK AT THAT BILL.

19:11.767 --> 19:13.333
- WHAT?

19:13.333 --> 19:14.733
- THAT'S RIGHT, "WHAT?"

19:14.733 --> 19:16.033
- I KNEW IT.

19:16.033 --> 19:17.533
WHEN HE PULLED OUT
THAT LITTLE TV

19:17.533 --> 19:19.200
AND I STARTED HEARING
"THE PRICE IS RIGHT" SONG

19:19.200 --> 19:23.667
AND HIM GUESSIN' PRICES,
AND ALWAYS OVER...

19:25.800 --> 19:27.433
THIS JUST SHOWS US,

19:27.433 --> 19:30.000
YOU SHOULD NEVER
HIRE A FRIEND.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.733
- YEAH, WELL.

19:31.733 --> 19:36.367
DON'T WORRY.
HE'S NOT MY FRIEND ANYMORE.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.633
- OH...

19:39.633 --> 19:40.900
- EASY, EASY.
