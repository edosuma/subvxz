Hey, here's-here's Rich.

01:30.691 --> 01:31.886
Watch me give him the big sell.

01:32.025 --> 01:32.890
- Right.
- Come on, come on.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.323
Big sell.
Hey, Rich, Rich!

01:34.461 --> 01:35.622
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Rich.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.287
How about buying
a chinchilla coat?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.421
Nah.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.291
You sure you didn't
pressure him too much?

01:43.737 --> 01:45.671
All right, now tell me.
What are you guys up to?

01:45.806 --> 01:48.332
Uh, Ralphie and I here
are, uh, chinchilla moguls.

01:48.475 --> 01:49.567
We have a ranch.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.508
Yeah. In the bathtub.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.135
Two chinchillas.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.374
Yeah.
I named them Herman and Harry.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.609
RALPH:
Herman and Harry?

01:57.751 --> 01:58.775
Yeah.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.478
Potsie, you bought two males?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.146
Yeah, they were cheaper.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.848
Besides,
boys are easier to raise.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.356
Oh.

02:06.393 --> 02:09.226
Explain it to him, Ralph.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.627
It'll be easier
to go out and buy a female.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.771
- Atenci6n.
- Hold that snap, Fonz!

02:19.906 --> 02:24.002
All right, Fonz, you want
to know a good way to get girls?

02:26.113 --> 02:29.743
Oh, golly gee, Ralphie.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.908
Girls?

02:32.052 --> 02:33.747
Do you think I could?

02:33.887 --> 02:36.618
- Well, let me put it
another way, Fonz. -Okay.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.158
How about a nice chinchilla seat
for your motorcycle?

02:39.292 --> 02:42.091
Just think, you'd be like
the Liberace of motorcycles.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.788
Hey, how would you like
a candelabra

02:43.930 --> 02:44.988
coming out of your ear?

02:45.132 --> 02:46.657
I don't think
I'd like that, Fonz.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.667
That's right.
Excuse me. Whoa.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.435
All right, girls,
off to the drive-in, huh?

02:53.573 --> 02:55.701
Now, remember, keep your hands
on the handlebars

02:55.842 --> 02:57.037
when I jump the fence.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.238
Now... you hold the popcorn,
you hold the speaker,

03:00.380 --> 03:01.541
the rest of you hold me.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.616
Whoa! Let's go...

03:06.386 --> 03:08.753
Okay, Rich, okay,
you say you don't want a coat.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.687
- How about a vest for $2,000?
- Huh?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.053
All right, all right, earmuffs.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.956
$500 an ear.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.324
Better make that $600.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.164
You'll love being a Magnet.

03:20.300 --> 03:23.201
You've already done your pledge
time, so next is the carnival.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.532
- That's raise-the-money time.
- Uh-huh.

03:25.672 --> 03:28.107
- And then is the weekend social.
- Uh-huh.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.709
You know what time that is.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.312
- Yeah. Hunk time.
- Hey, uh,

03:32.446 --> 03:33.709
someone give me a light, huh?

03:37.851 --> 03:39.717
Here, Joanie, have another.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.288
Oh, no.
I just ditched one.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.083
I'm trying to cut down.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.124
Well, uh, we're all having 'em.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.728
What, are you afraid
somebody might see you?

03:48.862 --> 03:50.330
No.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.364
Uh... okay.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.729
Take one of mine.
You're a Magnet now.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.933
(coughs)
Mmm. Smooth.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.176
Hey, Rich, that's Joanie!

04:03.310 --> 04:05.176
Joanie's in the Magnets.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.609
Oh, yeah.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.148
Good social club, you know,
nice bunch of girls.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.182
Ah, she's really growing up.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.685
Yeah, I'll say.
She's smoking and everything.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.289
What?! No, she's not smo...

04:16.423 --> 04:18.414
oh. yeah?

04:19.692 --> 04:21.684
(Richie clears his throat)

04:23.663 --> 04:27.099
Joanie, could I speak to you
for a moment over here, please?

04:27.234 --> 04:29.225
Excuse me.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.839
'Are YOu s . - N<'>1:1°k'ng?!

04:35.976 --> 04:37.637
(coughing)

04:37.778 --> 04:39.872
Funny! Very funny!

04:40.013 --> 04:41.412
All right,
when did you start to...?

04:41.548 --> 04:43.346
So I smoke.
But you listen, Richie.

04:43.483 --> 04:46.009
- You better not embarrass me in
front of the Magnets. -Well, no.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.552
Of course I'm not going to...

04:47.687 --> 04:49.052
Wait a minute.
I'm the older brother here.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.315
I'm the one giving the lecture.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.686
Well, it was worth a try.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.224
All right,
I'm gonna ask some questions,

04:53.360 --> 04:54.452
and I want some answers.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.323
Now, exactly when
did you start smoking?

04:56.463 --> 04:59.489
Recently.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.294
Good. It'll be easier
for you to quit.

05:01.434 --> 05:03.869
Aw, come on. Everybody does it.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.598
(mocking):
Everybody does it.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.607
I suppose you think it makes
you look real important, huh?

05:09.743 --> 05:10.938
It doesn't. It doesn't.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.171
It makes you look like
a stupid little kid, a child.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.542
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.173
Well, you don't see many
children with a shape like mine.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.684
Ah. So you're a shapely kid.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.810
You're still a kid.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.446
And puff, puff, puff.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.615
I mean, you look
like a little baby.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.057
An immature little baby,
a tiny, tiny baby.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.526
That's end of argument.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.629
Hey, Joanie,
I hardly recognized you.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.202
You look so much, uh, older.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.031
I think it's the cigarette.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.606
-(Joanie chuckles)
-(crowd chatter)

05:40.740 --> 05:43.402
Now... end of argument.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.109
I say
when it's end of arguments!

05:54.788 --> 05:56.654
Now...

05:56.790 --> 05:58.781
end of argument.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.502
(knocking)

06:13.640 --> 06:16.837
Uh... uh, uh, just a minute.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.071
Oh. Ooh. Okay, okay, okay.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.613
-(knocking)
- Wait. Hold it. Hold it.

06:22.682 --> 06:23.877
(muttering)

06:24.017 --> 06:26.349
(knocking)

06:26.486 --> 06:27.681
Come in.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.585
Oh, Richie, it's only you.

06:29.723 --> 06:33.182
Well, it's always nice
to see you, too.

06:33.326 --> 06:36.261
Now, look, I'm-I'm sorry
that I... blew up at Arnold's,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.660
and, uh, can we talk now?

06:38.798 --> 06:40.288
Oh, why not?

06:40.433 --> 06:43.198
- We're both adults.
- Adult?! Y-You see that?

06:43.336 --> 06:44.531
Now, I wasn't even treated

06:44.671 --> 06:46.264
like an adult
until last year, and...

06:46.406 --> 06:47.669
Richie, you're blowing up again.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.866
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
It's just that...

06:50.010 --> 06:51.842
Oh, man, when I saw you
smoking there,

06:51.978 --> 06:53.070
Joanie, it-it really upset me.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.443
- Oh, Ri-Richie, um...
- Oh!

06:55.582 --> 06:58.483
Oh! Oh!

06:58.618 --> 07:00.347
Are there ashes on my tongue?

07:00.487 --> 07:02.615
- No!
- Well, you're lucky!

07:02.756 --> 07:03.882
- Oh.
- Oh, Joanie.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.719
Smoking at home--
that's terrible.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.827
You-You're going
to become a chain smoker. You...

07:07.961 --> 07:09.827
- I will not.
- Oh, will you look at that?

07:09.963 --> 07:12.898
Yup, this is it.
You're hooked.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.660
Well, it may be
nothing now, but...

07:14.801 --> 07:15.996
but wait till it starts
getting really bad,

07:16.136 --> 07:17.297
and you're groping
around in the gutter

07:17.437 --> 07:19.462
just hoping to find a butt.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.371
Gutter?! Ha!

07:22.509 --> 07:25.479
Listen, you mind
your own business, bucko.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.410
Bucko, bucko, bucko!

07:27.547 --> 07:28.673
That's it.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.044
You give me that back!

07:30.183 --> 07:31.446
Oh, not until
you promise to quit.

07:31.584 --> 07:32.949
Come on, Rich, you have
no right. Give it back!

07:33.086 --> 07:34.611
I am not gonna give you this
back, Joanie.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.017
- It's mine. You don't smoke...
- It is mine now. I've got...

07:36.156 --> 07:37.248
- No, Joanie.
- JOANIE: It is not yours.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.585
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, that's enough, you two.

07:38.725 --> 07:39.749
MARION:
You're brother and sister.

07:39.893 --> 07:40.951
I don't see why
you can't get along.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.085
(gasping):
Richard!

07:45.999 --> 07:47.398
Oh, Howard, Richard is smoking.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.024
I see, Marion.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.864
Richard, what is the meaning
of this?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.302
Have you been smoking
behind our backs?

07:53.440 --> 07:54.669
No!

07:54.808 --> 07:56.401
And in front
of your little sister.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.444
Now don't tell me

08:01.581 --> 08:04.380
you just now decided
to try it for the first time.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.246
- No, no, but I...
- Oh, Richard, and after...

08:06.386 --> 08:08.320
- After your father had
that long talk with you. -Oh.

08:08.455 --> 08:10.947
You did have that long talk
with him, didn't you, Howard?

08:11.091 --> 08:13.583
Marion, I've had enough talks
with him

08:13.727 --> 08:15.855
to take him to his old age!

08:15.996 --> 08:17.691
Richard, this is very serious.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.163
You're going to have
to be punished for this.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.166
We're going to have
to ground him.

08:22.302 --> 08:25.101
Dad, I'm in college now.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.002
I'm a sophomore.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.701
They don't do that
to sophomores.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.643
Oh. Well, how about if
we take your car away from you?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.339
They do that to sophomores.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.144
Uh, Dad, I-l don't think

08:38.284 --> 08:40.013
you're gonna have
to punish Richie.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.450
Oh, Joanie,
that's very commendable,

08:41.587 --> 08:42.919
sticking up for your brother.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.150
It certainly is, sweetheart.
There, you see?

08:45.291 --> 08:47.521
Now why can't you be
like your sister?

08:47.660 --> 08:48.718
JOANIE:
Uh,

08:48.862 --> 08:51.194
M-Mom, Dad,
Richie wasn't smoking.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.663
I was.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.235
Oh, Joanie, that's not
commendable at all.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.304
You get downstairs, young lady.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.135
We're gonna have a little talk.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.369
Come on, Marion.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.036
Oh.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.806
We're sorry, Richard.

09:07.947 --> 09:10.416
But you did have
a cigarette in your hand.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.520
Oh, this is
a mother's nightmare!

09:16.256 --> 09:18.247
Thanks for taking the heat,
Rich.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.291
Ah, that's okay.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.486
It's gonna get a lot hotter.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.961
A lot hotter.

09:35.475 --> 09:38.274
Joanie, I just don't
understand it.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.402
Your mother doesn't smoke,
and I don't smoke.

09:40.547 --> 09:43.778
- I don't smoke.
- Nobody in this family smokes!

09:43.917 --> 09:45.783
Well, that's not quite true,
Howard.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.945
My mother started when she was
a girl, and she never stopped.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.889
We're not talking
about cigars, Marion!

09:55.228 --> 09:58.528
Now, look, Joanie,
just tell me why.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.635
Does it make you feel important,
or-or glamorous?

10:01.768 --> 10:04.738
You think it's glamorous to go
around with yellow fingers?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.837
Incidentally, you can take
the yellow outwith lemon juice.

10:08.975 --> 10:10.739
Do you mind?

10:10.877 --> 10:12.174
I'll handle this.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.178
Now, both of you
just sit down, huh?

10:14.314 --> 10:16.078
Oh, I'm sorry, Howard.
I won't say anything.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.342
- It's all right.
- Me, neither.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.542
Now, Joanie...

10:18.685 --> 10:20.915
I won't say that smoking
leads to heart attacks.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.853
Yeah, and lung disease.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.357
- Joanie... -I won't say anything
about some people thinking

10:29.496 --> 10:31.157
that smoking might lead
to cancer.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.891
Yeah, and all that tar and
garbage gets into your system,

10:34.033 --> 10:35.194
turns your lungs black.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.530
Will you two stop it?!

10:36.669 --> 10:37.693
Oh, I'm sorry. So, I'm sorry.

10:37.837 --> 10:38.895
Talk to Joanie.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.528
Just tell her that...

10:42.442 --> 10:44.501
You tell her that kissing
someone who smokes

10:44.644 --> 10:46.009
-is like kissing an ashtray.
- Yeah.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.945
Oh, Marion, please,
let me fin...

10:49.082 --> 10:51.244
Well, now,
how would anybody know anything

10:51.384 --> 10:53.148
about kissing an ashtray?

10:53.286 --> 10:55.152
Don't look at me.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.154
I'm a lamp man, myself.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.488
Uh, if you're through with me,
can I go upstairs?

11:02.629 --> 11:03.755
No, you can't.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.456
Now you listen to me,
young lady.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.623
I forbid you to smoke anymore.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.496
And if you continue
with this nonsense,

11:09.636 --> 11:11.900
you're going to be
grounded for so long

11:12.038 --> 11:13.506
that you're gonna grow roots.

11:13.640 --> 11:17.440
Why don't you let me
live my own life?

11:17.577 --> 11:19.170
I'm older now.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.247
Why can't you let me
make my own decisions?

11:23.716 --> 11:25.514
She's a young adult.

11:25.652 --> 11:28.349
More young than adult.

11:28.488 --> 11:32.083
All right. You want to make
your own decisions?

11:32.225 --> 11:33.420
You can try it.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.427
You go ahead
and make your own decisions.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.657
We'd like you to stop smoking.

11:40.934 --> 11:44.199
Well... I'll think about it.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.271
Think about it?!
Go to your room!

11:46.406 --> 11:47.805
- Howard...
- All right, all right.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.239
You can think about it,
that'll be fine.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.208
Dad... I don't want to say

11:56.349 --> 11:58.249
you play favorites
or anything, but, uh...

11:58.384 --> 11:59.510
(door closes)

11:59.652 --> 12:01.518
How come you just gave her
my 18-year-old speech,

12:01.654 --> 12:03.748
and she's only 16?

12:03.890 --> 12:07.554
Because girls mature faster.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.523
Ah.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.678
(match striking)

13:03.283 --> 13:05.615
Hi, fellas.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.277
- Hey, Mr. C.
- Hi, Dad.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.287
Hiya, Howie.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.449
- Want to buy a nice
chinchilla coat? -Yeah.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.618
No, thanks, Ralphie.
I like cashmere.

13:15.762 --> 13:18.697
Hey, Malph, maybe
we should raise cashmeres.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.926
Boys, do you mind?
I would like to talk to my son.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.036
- Oh. Yeah. -Sure. Move over,
Rich. Make room for Daddy.

13:24.170 --> 13:27.333
Alone.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.804
- We can take a hint.
- All right.

13:28.941 --> 13:30.033
- So long. Come on.
- See ya.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.473
- See ya.
- Have a nice talk.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.806
Yeah.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.276
Hey, Malph, Malph,

13:34.414 --> 13:36.508
Mr. C came a long way
just to see Rich.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.048
Must be something big.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.551
Yeah. I bet a girl got him
in trouble.

13:40.687 --> 13:44.646
Mr. C? Nah.

13:44.791 --> 13:48.819
Not Mr. C. Oh, Potsie.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.328
Dad, I'm fine, school's fine.

13:51.464 --> 13:54.058
Now, what are you doing here?
ls there something wrong?

13:54.200 --> 13:55.668
Well, yes, Richard.

13:55.802 --> 13:56.997
- AL: Ah.
- It's Joanie.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.002
- Hi, Howard.
- Hello, Al.

13:59.138 --> 14:00.503
(chuckles)
Why the long face?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.335
You don't eat here.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.910
Oh.

14:05.044 --> 14:08.207
It's Joanie, Al.
She started to smoke.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.713
Yeah, I know. I saw her.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.908
And I told her.

14:12.051 --> 14:12.984
Well, Richard, what do you think
we ought to...?

14:13.119 --> 14:13.984
AL:
You know,

14:14.120 --> 14:16.088
I once dated a girl who smoked.

14:16.222 --> 14:20.591
And I told her, "When you stop
smoking, give me a call."

14:20.727 --> 14:23.458
That was 1934.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.927
Or was it '35?

14:25.064 --> 14:26.862
- It was '35, Al.
-'35.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.990
Yeah, yup, WP-

14:32.171 --> 14:34.037
I just don't know, Richard.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.198
- Kids.
- Yeah, kids.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.969
Try to save them a little hurt,

14:38.111 --> 14:39.943
you give them the benefit
of your experience.

14:40.079 --> 14:41.376
Well, they won't listen.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.484
No, they got to go out and
find things out for themselves.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.413
Never changes.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.076
Children just do not listen

14:47.220 --> 14:48.688
to their parents today.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.119
I remember the first time
I didn't listen to you.

14:51.257 --> 14:53.282
Mm. Oh, wasn't that the time

14:53.426 --> 14:56.396
with the girl with the big,
uh... uh, angora sweater?

14:56.529 --> 14:59.021
You better believe it.

14:59.165 --> 15:02.692
Yeah. I didn't think
you'd listen to me on that one.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.471
Yeah.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.439
Listen, Richard, maybe

15:09.575 --> 15:11.304
if-if you had a talk
with Joanie, huh?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.913
Dad, they won't listen
to older brothers, either.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.639
Hey.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.452

Fonzie?

17:02.622 --> 17:04.521
What's shaking, shortcake?

17:04.656 --> 17:07.490
Well, this is the first time
you've seen my room. How come?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.253
Oh, I-l figure
I'd be a neighbor,

17:09.395 --> 17:10.624
you know, real friendly like.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.321
I was just passing
down the corridor.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.025
I thought I'd stop in,
say hello, you know.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.295
- Hey, that's great Elvis, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.301
Number two Elvis, hey?
That's even better, huh?

17:22.742 --> 17:24.267

17:24.410 --> 17:28.074
All right, Fonzie, I'm through
with all the lectures.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.148
Hey, I don't lecture.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.081
I'm just gonna ask you
one simple question,

17:32.218 --> 17:33.743
and then listen.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.480
You really like to smoke?

17:36.622 --> 17:39.421
Yeah. There's nothing
like a good ciggy.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.118
You know, light up
with friends,

17:41.260 --> 17:44.195
relax, a few laughs. (laughs)

17:44.330 --> 17:48.426
A couple more of those and, uh,
your nose is gonna grow.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.195
All right, it's the Magnets.

17:50.336 --> 17:53.271
They're the most popular club
at Jefferson.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.841
Who do you think
made them so popular?

17:57.476 --> 18:00.537
Well... I'm in with the Magnets,

18:00.680 --> 18:02.273
and-and most of 'em smoke,
and...

18:02.415 --> 18:04.042
And you're afraid
that if you don't,

18:04.183 --> 18:06.277
they're going to dump you
and call you chicken.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.148
That's not it, Fonzie.

18:08.287 --> 18:09.755
I'm a high school junior.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.050
(gasps)

18:11.190 --> 18:13.386
I beg your pardon.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.460
Sit down for a minute.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.563
Let me tell you something.

18:17.697 --> 18:21.463
The hardest thing to do is
to do what you want to do.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.627
You know what a breeze it is
to join the crowd,

18:24.770 --> 18:27.000
be led around by your nose?

18:27.139 --> 18:30.973
You ain't nobody till you do
what you want to do.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.078
But I want to be in this club.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.839
Well, let me put it another way.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.312
Smoking ain't cool.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.781
The Magnets are cool.

18:40.152 --> 18:42.314
My humility usually
don't permit me

18:42.455 --> 18:44.617
to ask this particular question.

18:44.757 --> 18:48.694
Who is the coolest of cool?

18:48.828 --> 18:49.886
Well, you are.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.020
Yeah, that's true. (laughs)

18:54.033 --> 18:56.798
Now, if the Fonz don't smoke,

18:56.936 --> 18:59.200
what does that tell you
about smoking?

18:59.338 --> 19:00.863
That the Fonz doesn't smoke.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.873
But some of the cool kids do.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.808
You gonna give up
smoking or not?

19:05.945 --> 19:07.811
Well, I don't know, Fonzie.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.075
All right, end of convo.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.116
- JOANIE: Fonz?
- Yeah, what?

19:12.251 --> 19:16.085
If I don't smoke,
the Magnets will dump me.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.624
Let me plant two things
in your brain.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.892
You're my favorite shortcake.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.627
And number two--
if you don't stop smoking,

19:29.769 --> 19:31.828
your body is gonna dump you.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.872
And I'm crazy about you.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.998
Whoa.

19:49.388 --> 19:52.050
Well, guys,
how's the chinchilla business?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.784
They gave it up
when they found out

19:53.926 --> 19:56.361
you have to kill 'em
to get the skins.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.190
They thought
they would just shed.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.991
(Potsie chuckles)

20:00.132 --> 20:02.191
I was gonna shave 'em.
(chuckles)

20:02.334 --> 20:05.065
But it's tough to make
a chinchilla go like this.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.865
(laughter)

20:07.006 --> 20:09.498
I still got it,
even in big business.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.839
So, anyway, they're, uh...
they're into greeting cards now.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.946
That's right, Al.
We got 'em for all occasions.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.207
How many do you want?

20:16.348 --> 20:19.113
Well, I'll take one
for Lincoln's birthday.

20:19.251 --> 20:20.741
Lincoln's dead.

20:20.886 --> 20:24.550
Sam Lincoln is dead?

20:24.690 --> 20:26.886
I just saw him this morning.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.495
Well, you never know.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.897
So, Joanie, you're in charge
of decorations for this weekend.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.902
Right. I've got a great idea.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.699
Salute to the varsity.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.808
We get the whole team
and a huge cake

20:42.942 --> 20:44.239
and have 'em pop out of it.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.743
Great idea. Hey, wait.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.644
That means there will be
two guys for each girl.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.807
Uh-huh, I know. (laughs)

20:52.852 --> 20:54.479
Guys.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.849
- Hey, Fonz.
- Hi, Fonz.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.080
No date tonight?

20:57.223 --> 20:58.816
Wash your mouth out.

20:59.892 --> 21:00.882
RALPH:
Hey, Fonz,

21:01.026 --> 21:02.323
we're in the greeting card
business now.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.429
- Want to buy some?
- Yeah.

21:04.563 --> 21:06.122
Oh, now, that's different, yeah.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.359
All right, I'll take
about a thousand of this one

21:08.501 --> 21:11.334
that says "I love you,
you are the only one."

21:11.470 --> 21:14.132
A thousand
"You're the only one"?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.934
That's right. I have this urge

21:16.075 --> 21:19.238
to spread hope
all over the world.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.813
Yeah. It's Joanie.
She's gonna...

21:21.947 --> 21:23.415
Kiss?

21:23.549 --> 21:24.812
<i>No, no, Joanna's gonna smoke.</i>

21:24.950 --> 21:26.213
Oh, smoke.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.751
All right,
I'll take care of this.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.116
No, Fonz, wait.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.223
You got
to let her handle this herself.

21:31.357 --> 21:33.485
I'll give her five seconds
to change her mind.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.617
All right, thanks.

21:37.163 --> 21:38.255
Here, Joanie, light up.

21:38.397 --> 21:40.593
I'll teach you how
to do the French inhale.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.724
Oh.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.966
Uh... no.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.100
I don't smoke.

21:54.947 --> 21:58.042
Why not? You chicken?

21:58.184 --> 21:59.913
No, I'm not chicken.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.520
I just don't want it.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.454
Well, come on, Joanie.
I mean, it's not too cool.

22:05.591 --> 22:08.185
Oh, well,
I've been thinking about cool,

22:08.327 --> 22:10.091
and I decided
everyone should decide

22:10.229 --> 22:11.993
what's best for themselves.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.293
And I don't think
smoking is cool.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.364
So, what do you say, Angela?

22:18.504 --> 22:21.633
Who do you want in the Magnets?
Me or my lungs?

22:21.774 --> 22:24.004
Take it easy, Joanie.
We-we want you.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.475
(Richie laughs quietly)

22:26.612 --> 22:29.047
Okay. No cigarettes.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.809
Boy, you got guts.
Wish I had.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.943
Maybe then I wouldn't be up
to two packs a day.

22:35.087 --> 22:38.352
I did save enough coupons to get
my dad a new bowling ball.

22:40.626 --> 22:44.256
Well, I proved one thing
to myself.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.561
Now I have to prove another.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.867
Uh... hi, Jim.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.336
Hi, Joanie.

22:54.473 --> 22:57.704
Uh, remember you told me
I was grown up because I smoked?

22:57.843 --> 22:59.140
Yeah?

22:59.278 --> 23:01.940
Uh, well, I don't smoke anymore.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.573
What do you say now?

23:04.717 --> 23:06.242
I was wrong.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.150
I... I guess...
it wasn't the cigarettes.

23:09.288 --> 23:10.517
- Uh.
- Want to dance?

23:10.656 --> 23:12.522
You bet.

23:12.658 --> 23:14.649
(slow instrumental music plays)

23:33.012 --> 23:35.003
(crickets chirping)

23:37.416 --> 23:39.282
Now I've made
my own decision now,

23:39.418 --> 23:41.648
and I've given up
smoking for good.

23:41.787 --> 23:44.882
Well, Joanie,
lam so proud of you.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.219
(Joanie chuckles softly)

23:46.358 --> 23:47.587
(phone ringing)

23:47.726 --> 23:50.058
You're gonna be a lot happier,
too, when you get older.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.720
- Oh.
- Hello?

23:51.864 --> 23:53.457
Oh, Ann, uh, just a minute.

23:53.599 --> 23:54.930
It's Ann Hanson.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.330
She wants to know
if we're going

23:56.468 --> 23:59.438
to that silly Leopard Lodge
party at the Pfister Hotel.

23:59.571 --> 24:02.734
Oh, gosh,
how I hate those parties.

24:02.875 --> 24:07.176
Everybody throwing water bags
out the hotel windows.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.213
Tell her "yes."

24:11.050 --> 24:13.417
oh. yes?
Why are you going, Dado

24:13.552 --> 24:14.781
Well, it's the Leopard Lodge.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.115
<i>Everybody“ be there.</i>

24:16.255 --> 24:17.552
It just wouldn't be right.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.715
You know, you're doing just
what I did with smoking.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.520
Doing it because
everyone else does it.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.823
You know something?
You're right.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.762
Tell her we're not going.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.300
Ann, I'm-I'm so sorry.

24:29.435 --> 24:30.664
- Good, Dad. -We're not going
to be able to make it.

24:30.803 --> 24:31.929
- I'm proud of you.
- MARION: Maybe next time.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.505
-(Howard makes kissing sound)
- Okay. Bye-bye.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.835
We'll go to a movie instead.

24:35.975 --> 24:39.104
Uh, dear,
I thought we were going,

24:39.244 --> 24:41.975
and I just spent $37
on a new dress.

24:42.114 --> 24:45.140
$37?!

24:45.284 --> 24:48.117
Marion, go to your room!

24:48.253 --> 24:50.278
What?!

24:50.422 --> 24:52.891
I'll be up there
in a few minutes.
