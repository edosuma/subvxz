WEBVTT

00:01.238 --> 00:02.396
Thank you.

00:02.515 --> 00:04.882
And keep the change.

00:04.884 --> 00:06.950
- Dr. Harris.
- Hey!

00:06.952 --> 00:08.718
Summer, thanks for bringing him in.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.609
- Oh, hey, buddy!
- Whoop.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.991
Okay, now. Here's the diapers and bunky.

00:15.091 --> 00:16.091
Thank you.

00:16.093 --> 00:17.894
Now, you're sure Dr. Reid's
okay with this.

00:17.896 --> 00:19.116
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I wouldn't worry about that.

00:19.116 --> 00:20.007
'Cause, you know, after I got

00:20.007 --> 00:20.965
a little carried away at the party,

00:20.965 --> 00:21.827
she's only given me a second chance

00:21.827 --> 00:23.691
because Luke cries
nonstop with anyone else.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.767
Well, why don't you, um, take
the rest of the day off?

00:28.304 --> 00:30.471
Don't screw me on this, Dr. Harris.

00:30.473 --> 00:32.841
Now, don't forget, Luke gets
his morning snack...

00:32.843 --> 00:34.142
You got it, you got it. Okay.

00:34.144 --> 00:35.610
Yep, bye!

00:35.612 --> 00:37.679
Ring, ring!
What?!

00:37.681 --> 00:40.849
Who's... who's on the phone?
Hello?

00:40.851 --> 00:42.083
I'm sorry, I-I can't hear you.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.984
I got a banana in my ear.

00:43.986 --> 00:46.820
- I can't stop scratching.
- Okay, you know what?

00:46.822 --> 00:49.489
I'll get you an ointment to take
away the scabby feeling, okay?

00:52.695 --> 00:54.127
I'll be back in a sec, okay?

00:54.129 --> 00:56.396
Try not to scratch.

00:56.398 --> 00:59.366
Okay.

00:59.368 --> 01:04.203
Mrs. Kilbride, your son is in
what we call chronic rejection.

01:04.205 --> 01:07.040
He'll need a new liver
as soon as possible.

01:07.042 --> 01:09.809
He was so much better
after his transplant.

01:09.811 --> 01:12.311
- What's happened?
- His liver's lost function.

01:12.313 --> 01:15.014
We're unable to suppress
the antibodies he's producing.

01:15.016 --> 01:17.482
Which is why we're working
so hard to find him a new one.

01:17.484 --> 01:19.417
And given Colin's weakened
immune system,

01:19.419 --> 01:22.120
the best match would be part of
a liver from a living donor.

01:22.122 --> 01:25.724
But you tested us all...
me, his aunts, his uncles.

01:25.726 --> 01:26.892
No one's a match.

01:26.894 --> 01:28.393
What about his father?

01:28.395 --> 01:31.362
I reached out to him. No luck.

01:31.364 --> 01:33.631
So he doesn't know that
his son's seriously ill?

01:33.633 --> 01:36.133
Um, well, I can't talk to him.

01:36.135 --> 01:37.334
Not directly.

01:37.336 --> 01:38.569
Why not?

01:39.768 --> 01:41.438
He has a police handler.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.173
[sighs]

01:43.175 --> 01:45.009
Danny...

01:45.011 --> 01:46.711
was a biker.

01:46.713 --> 01:48.713
An enforcer with the J.M.C.

01:48.715 --> 01:50.547
And he cut a deal with the police,

01:50.549 --> 01:51.748
turned in his brothers,

01:51.750 --> 01:54.117
and he's been in witness
protection ever since.

01:54.119 --> 01:55.518
How long?

01:55.520 --> 01:58.054
Coming up... six years.

01:58.056 --> 02:00.389
Okay, then we go back to searching

02:00.391 --> 02:01.925
for an unrelated donor.

02:01.927 --> 02:03.627
Someone who is an exact blood type

02:03.629 --> 02:06.062
and whose liver function
assessment works for Colin.

02:08.065 --> 02:10.765
Those are terrible odds, aren't they?

02:10.768 --> 02:12.501
It's what we've got right now.

02:12.503 --> 02:15.270
So we'll keep his fluid
and electrolyte balance stable

02:15.272 --> 02:16.471
and cross our fingers.

02:16.473 --> 02:18.907
Okay.

02:22.747 --> 02:25.896
Stat geek, hatchet man.

02:25.998 --> 02:27.716
Hooved spawn of Satan.

02:27.827 --> 02:29.320
He's just trying to live up
to his billing.

02:29.485 --> 02:33.087
Yeah, by slashing my ER budget
and turning ambulances away.

02:33.089 --> 02:35.123
He was named one of
the most influential

02:35.125 --> 02:37.125
business minds under 35.

02:37.127 --> 02:38.359
Doesn't hurt that his uncle

02:38.361 --> 02:40.061
is head of the Hospital Association.

02:40.063 --> 02:43.295
Influential and connected. Great.

02:44.043 --> 02:45.132
Do me a favor and promise me

02:45.134 --> 02:46.867
you'll wipe the floor with this guy.

02:50.405 --> 02:52.839
Dr. Bell, you know how many hospitals

02:52.841 --> 02:54.307
there are in this city?

02:54.309 --> 02:56.276
- 24.
- 23, actually.

02:56.278 --> 02:59.045
St. Nathaniel is merging
with Scarborough Regional

02:59.047 --> 03:01.213
at the end of the month. Have a seat.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.481
I hadn't heard.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.884
Of those 23, we're one of four
major trauma centers

03:04.886 --> 03:06.552
and one of five transplant hubs.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.821
Transplant and Trauma
put Hope Zion on the map.

03:08.823 --> 03:10.355
Yeah.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.292
You've heard of Easter Island, Dr. Bell?

03:13.294 --> 03:14.393
Of course.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.161
It used to be on the map, too.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.997
Now, the theory goes it was
a thriving civilization...

03:18.999 --> 03:20.665
quite advanced for its time.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.501
But their way of life wasn't sustainable.

03:23.503 --> 03:27.972
They used up their resources and... poof.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.775
All that's left now are some...

03:30.777 --> 03:32.910
you know, the big heads.

03:36.082 --> 03:39.482
So I'm one of the big heads
in this scenario, is that it?

03:39.484 --> 03:41.618
You've done some great work here, Dawn.

03:41.620 --> 03:42.986
No one questions that.

03:42.988 --> 03:45.255
But the medical landscape has changed.

03:45.257 --> 03:47.657
- So, efficiencies?
- Rebranding.

03:48.010 --> 03:50.426
And you will be personally affected.

03:50.428 --> 03:52.762
Cardiac transplants have to go first,

03:52.764 --> 03:54.663
Trauma will be next in line.

03:54.665 --> 03:56.799
Thomas, there has to be another way.

03:56.801 --> 03:59.802
I've looked at other scenarios...
this is the best one.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.070
I'll need you to transfer

04:01.072 --> 04:03.139
your pre-op patients
to other hospitals.

04:03.141 --> 04:06.275
We'll make sure they're placed
in the best possible care.

04:09.412 --> 04:10.746
Whoa, whoa... hey!

04:10.748 --> 04:12.494
What do you think you're doing
with the good gloves?

04:12.748 --> 04:14.865
My patient has scabies.
I'm using the good ones.

04:14.916 --> 04:15.937
No.

04:16.035 --> 04:17.584
Okay, you can use <i> one</i> of those gloves.

04:17.587 --> 04:19.654
Because you want me to get scabies?

04:21.925 --> 04:23.491
Okay, everyone, gather around!

04:23.493 --> 04:26.894
Huddle up, come here. Quickly, let's go.

04:26.896 --> 04:30.231
[sighs]
Now, listen, this is for your ears only.

04:30.233 --> 04:32.266
Okay, I have it on very good authority...

04:32.268 --> 04:34.434
He means his girlfriend.

04:35.463 --> 04:38.538
That the new baby-faced assassin
is planning on more cuts,

04:38.540 --> 04:40.840
and he's going to be in our ER
today assessing us.

04:40.842 --> 04:43.042
But we already took a major haircut.

04:43.044 --> 04:44.710
Why are you looking at me like that?

04:44.712 --> 04:47.075
I-I'm not. [clears throat] Super Cuts.

04:47.110 --> 04:48.081
Man, don't talk to me about cuts.

04:48.083 --> 04:49.715
I've been in these scrubs for three days.

04:49.717 --> 04:51.117
Yeah, cuts don't affect the laundry.

04:51.119 --> 04:52.819
Look, we need a good day.

04:52.821 --> 04:55.221
Okay, guys, we need a perfect day.

04:55.223 --> 04:57.657
We just need to prove
to this pencil-pushing

04:57.659 --> 05:00.058
C-3PO-looking man-boy that
we're the best damn ER

05:00.060 --> 05:01.026
in the country, got it?

05:01.028 --> 05:03.495
[As C-3PO] Great idea, Master Luke.

05:07.289 --> 05:08.400
Back when I was in the seminary,

05:08.402 --> 05:11.069
I, uh, used to get really tired
of that question,

05:11.071 --> 05:12.404
"Why would God do this?"

05:12.406 --> 05:14.006
- Makes you wonder.
- Yeah.

05:15.408 --> 05:16.507
So you think we're really gonna

05:16.509 --> 05:17.675
find a match for this little guy?

05:17.677 --> 05:19.043
I don't know.

05:19.045 --> 05:22.213
But it doesn't help anyone to give up.

05:22.215 --> 05:24.615
Excuse me, are you
Colin Kilbride's doctor?

05:24.617 --> 05:25.817
I am, yes.

05:25.819 --> 05:26.951
Oh!

05:26.953 --> 05:29.386
[grunting]

05:29.388 --> 05:33.056
- Don't scream, okay?
- Okay.

05:33.058 --> 05:35.225
I don't want to hurt you.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.313 --> 05:46.847
My name is Danny Kilbride.

05:46.849 --> 05:49.016
I'm here to help my son.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.927
How is Colin?

05:59.929 --> 06:01.728
I-I can take you to him.

06:01.730 --> 06:04.030
No.

06:04.032 --> 06:05.432
I want to help him.

06:05.434 --> 06:08.935
But this has to stay
off the record, okay?

06:08.937 --> 06:12.072
I might be
compromised already.

06:12.074 --> 06:13.440
What do you mean?

06:13.442 --> 06:16.109
Joanie contacted my handler,
uh, a few weeks ago.

06:16.111 --> 06:18.311
And that might be enough
for them to trace her number.

06:18.313 --> 06:19.611
Okay, so you're saying...

06:19.613 --> 06:21.947
So what I'm saying is that 
it is very likely

06:21.949 --> 06:23.682
that somebody is following her,

06:23.684 --> 06:26.585
somebody that wants to kill me.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.220
Okay.

06:30.091 --> 06:32.924
But you do understand that
once we start in on this,

06:32.926 --> 06:34.993
there's... there's no turning back.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.661
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

06:37.663 --> 06:40.331
Do you know your blood type?

06:40.333 --> 06:42.666
No, ma'am.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.235
Well, let's start there.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.037
And if you're a match...

06:47.039 --> 06:49.574
we will figure out the rest somehow.

06:51.043 --> 06:53.276
Now, I need to get a blood draw kit.

06:53.278 --> 06:54.911
- All right?
- Yeah.

06:54.913 --> 06:57.180
Okay. Just wait here.

07:03.822 --> 07:06.590
Okay, you may want to look away
for this part.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.391
Oh, no, I'm good.

07:08.393 --> 07:12.194
So we're gonna do a CBC
and check your electrolytes,

07:12.196 --> 07:14.163
make sure your body
is healthy enough.

07:14.165 --> 07:15.864
To go ahead and poison it.

07:15.866 --> 07:18.334
I know. Crazy, right?

07:18.336 --> 07:19.901
- Mm-hmm.
- Take a deep breath.

07:19.903 --> 07:22.238
Oh, I'm not gonna pass out on you.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.473
You know how I made money as a teenager?

07:24.475 --> 07:26.342
Mopping up after cattle births.

07:26.344 --> 07:29.076
Oh, my God, that's... you're joking.

07:29.078 --> 07:32.079
Come on, Dr. Lin, I'm not that hardcore.

07:32.081 --> 07:33.814
I actually worked at Zehrs.

07:33.816 --> 07:36.884
Oh. Okay.

07:36.886 --> 07:38.386
That's it.

07:41.791 --> 07:42.957
You okay?

07:42.959 --> 07:44.158
Mm-hmm.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.893
Want me to get someone
to walk you to Chemo?

07:46.895 --> 07:49.006
[sighs] I should be good.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.565
Although after my last chemo treatment,

07:51.567 --> 07:53.167
I threw up all over my Uber.

07:53.169 --> 07:55.469
Is Violet coming to get you?

07:55.471 --> 07:58.071
Nope.

07:58.073 --> 07:59.706
She left.

07:59.708 --> 08:01.774
Actually, I kicked her out.

08:01.776 --> 08:04.877
So I guess she left. It was pretty messy.

08:04.879 --> 08:06.279
I'm sorry.

08:06.281 --> 08:09.182
She was halfway out the door, anyways.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.217
Her loss, right?

08:11.219 --> 08:14.119
That's the spirit.

08:14.121 --> 08:17.156
Maybe there's a little
country optimism in you yet.

08:17.158 --> 08:18.256
[chuckles]

08:18.258 --> 08:19.424
I'll see you up there.

08:19.426 --> 08:20.858
See you up there.

08:23.163 --> 08:25.763
I look forward to seeing
your team rise to the challenge

08:25.765 --> 08:27.865
of a more fiscally responsible discipline.

08:27.867 --> 08:30.134
Yes. I look forward as well, Thomas.

08:30.136 --> 08:32.970
I wish Dr. Bell shared
your enthusiasm, Zachary.

08:32.972 --> 08:34.871
Oh, she's just saving her pep for the OR.

08:34.874 --> 08:37.341
- Incoming!
- Joe Falstaff, 29 years old.

08:37.342 --> 08:39.775
He fell four stories installing
windows at a downtown condo.

08:39.778 --> 08:41.977
Okay, let's stop here.
Hi, Joe, my name is Dr. Miller.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.147
Can you hear me? Can you open your eyes?

08:44.149 --> 08:45.349
What do we got?

08:45.351 --> 08:47.117
Construction worker
fell four stories. Billy?

08:47.119 --> 08:49.152
Looks like massive internal hemorrhaging.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.387
It's not just blood.

08:50.389 --> 08:52.422
There's cranial content here...
skull is mush.

08:52.424 --> 08:53.389
Okay.

08:53.391 --> 08:55.625
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

08:55.627 --> 08:56.426
Jackson?

08:56.428 --> 08:57.560
Nothing.

08:58.995 --> 09:00.337
Okay, there's no brain function.

09:00.337 --> 09:02.020
Let's call in Neuro just to confirm.

09:02.391 --> 09:03.733
Chart says he's a donor.

09:03.735 --> 09:05.935
Okay, let's get him on a vent.

09:05.937 --> 09:07.604
Thanks, guys.

09:17.914 --> 09:20.382
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hmm.

09:20.384 --> 09:22.718
Mmm, yeah, hi. Wow, that was quick.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.287
I'm joking. I've been waiting for hours.

09:25.289 --> 09:26.920
Okay, well, someone will be
with you shortly,

09:26.922 --> 09:28.723
but in the meantime,
you can't smoke that in here.

09:28.725 --> 09:31.425
Mmm. It's okay because it's a vape, so...

09:31.427 --> 09:33.060
I don't care if it's holy water.

09:33.062 --> 09:35.630
You can't smoke that mouth
fedora in my ER, you got it?

09:35.632 --> 09:38.366
If you take another drag off
that, I'm gonna call security.

09:40.970 --> 09:43.170
Very mature.

09:43.172 --> 09:45.272
- Hey, doc.
- Yep.

09:45.274 --> 09:46.806
Where are the elevators at?

09:46.808 --> 09:48.675
It's down the hall there.

09:48.677 --> 09:49.842
[glass shatters, woman screams]

09:49.844 --> 09:51.043
[screams]

09:51.045 --> 09:53.313
- My mouth! My mouth!
- Don't touch your face!

09:53.315 --> 09:54.547
Okay, oh, no, no, don't touch
it, don't touch.

09:54.549 --> 09:56.949
Nurse, uh, can I get a nurse?
We need a nurse!

09:56.951 --> 09:58.718
Uh...

09:58.720 --> 10:00.286
You'll be just fine.

10:01.922 --> 10:03.656
[moans]

10:04.825 --> 10:06.925
Sekara, you're with me today.

10:06.927 --> 10:09.561
Uh, I was actually just about
to report to the ER.

10:09.563 --> 10:10.929
Change of plans.

10:10.931 --> 10:13.031
Three of these are in
end-stage heart failure.

10:13.033 --> 10:15.033
Most of them are on a bridge
to transplant.

10:15.035 --> 10:16.868
Well, I'm honored you asked me to help.

10:16.870 --> 10:18.202
Oh, we're not helping.

10:18.204 --> 10:21.105
We're starting the process of
transferring them out of here.

10:21.107 --> 10:23.341
[P.A. beeps, indistinct announcement]

10:23.343 --> 10:26.678
Dr. Bell, is it Wednesday already?

10:26.680 --> 10:27.912
What happens Wednesday?

10:27.914 --> 10:29.980
Sally is the leader of our book club.

10:29.982 --> 10:31.516
Well, three is hardly a club.

10:31.518 --> 10:33.117
Dr. Bell blackmailed her boyfriend

10:33.119 --> 10:34.685
into hearing me go on about books.

10:34.687 --> 10:38.054
- You're welcome to join us, Doctor...
- Sekara.

10:38.056 --> 10:39.155
What are you reading?

10:39.157 --> 10:40.824
"War and Peace."

10:40.826 --> 10:42.926
Still. [Chuckles]
[Monitor beeps]

10:42.928 --> 10:45.562
"We can only know that we know nothing,"

10:45.564 --> 10:47.864
"and that's the highest degree
of human wisdom."

10:47.866 --> 10:49.899
Very good.

10:49.901 --> 10:52.134
I like a well-read man.

10:52.136 --> 10:53.769
So, Sally, I need to assess

10:53.771 --> 10:56.004
that you are well enough to travel.

10:56.006 --> 10:57.673
Travel where?

10:57.675 --> 11:00.175
We're gonna be transferring you
to Mississauga Memorial.

11:00.177 --> 11:02.044
They have a wonderful
transplant program there.

11:02.046 --> 11:04.380
Dr. Bradley is a masterful surgeon.

11:04.382 --> 11:05.948
But I want to stay here.

11:05.950 --> 11:08.150
We understand that, but the...

11:08.152 --> 11:10.051
No, I just got settled.

11:10.053 --> 11:12.754
M-My books are here, <i>you're</i> here.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.956
You've been my surgeon for six years.

11:14.958 --> 11:17.225
I understand that this
must come as a shock.

11:17.227 --> 11:21.095
You told me after that first surgery

11:21.097 --> 11:23.865
that we would see this through together.

11:28.537 --> 11:30.437
My hands are tied, Sally.

11:31.741 --> 11:33.540
I am so sorry.

11:41.216 --> 11:43.949
Something on your mind, Dr. Reid?

11:43.951 --> 11:46.318
Oh, just one of those days.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.787
Well, do you feel like sharing?

11:47.789 --> 11:50.089
I would, but then I'd have to kill you.

11:50.091 --> 11:52.291
So...

11:52.293 --> 11:54.326
- I'm only half joking.
- Right.

11:54.328 --> 11:56.496
Well, whatever it is, I'd like to help.

11:56.498 --> 12:00.832
Okay. Um...

12:00.834 --> 12:04.836
Meet me in the storage closet
by the lab in 10 minutes?

12:04.838 --> 12:07.706
- Storage closet?
- Yeah, just trust me, okay?

12:07.708 --> 12:09.608
- Okay.
- Sorry to interrupt.

12:09.610 --> 12:10.909
You're not interrupting.

12:10.911 --> 12:12.711
- 10 minutes.
- Yeah.

12:15.015 --> 12:17.882
- What do you need?
- Uh, your signature, actually.

12:17.884 --> 12:18.916
What am I signing?

12:18.918 --> 12:20.250
It's a test run for Luke.

12:20.252 --> 12:22.119
I thought we talked about daycare

12:22.121 --> 12:24.789
and decided a stay-at-home nanny
was best for Luke.

12:24.791 --> 12:27.591
Yeah, we did, but, uh, I don't
get to see him anymore, Alex.

12:27.593 --> 12:29.259
Okay. Uh, our hours are insane.

12:29.261 --> 12:31.328
How are we gonna make
daycare hours work?

12:31.330 --> 12:32.461
We'll make it work.

12:32.461 --> 12:33.609
Shahir and Jonathan already agreed

12:33.618 --> 12:35.317
to help with off-hour transitions.

12:35.514 --> 12:37.867
So you told them about this
before talking to me?

12:37.869 --> 12:40.069
[cellphone buzzes]

12:40.071 --> 12:41.604
[sighs]

12:42.108 --> 12:43.873
It's the daycare.

12:43.875 --> 12:45.475
They say that Luke won't stop crying.

12:45.477 --> 12:47.009
They're supposed to call me.

12:47.011 --> 12:48.845
So you already put him in daycare.

12:48.847 --> 12:51.346
[sighs] It's a one-day trial, Alex.

12:51.348 --> 12:54.182
Look... he's my son, okay.

12:54.184 --> 12:55.884
I should be able to see him
whenever I want,

12:55.886 --> 12:57.519
but I can't do that
when he's at the condo

12:57.521 --> 12:58.954
because I don't live
there anymore.

12:59.190 --> 13:00.989
Well, I'm gonna call Summer
and get her to come back here.

13:00.991 --> 13:03.158
- Whatever.
- You went behind my back.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.060
Maybe it's 'cause I don't want
to talk to you these days, Alex.

13:05.062 --> 13:06.662
Oh, so what, you're just
gonna lie to me?

13:06.664 --> 13:08.162
- I didn't lie to you.
- Yeah, you did.

13:15.805 --> 13:17.438
It's me.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.106
I hate surprises.

13:24.947 --> 13:27.113
- Wait, wait, wait!
- I told you no one else can know.

13:27.115 --> 13:29.015
Okay, okay, listen,
he's a vascular surgeon.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.584
He is your son's vascular surgeon.

13:30.586 --> 13:32.853
Please just, he... he needs
to be here, too.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.722
Let him go. Let him go. Please?

13:41.429 --> 13:42.928
We cool?

13:42.930 --> 13:46.164
That depends, brother.
That all depends on you.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.166
All right.

13:48.168 --> 13:50.870
We have good news.

13:50.872 --> 13:53.372
You and your son are a match.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.241
Blood type and HLA, too.

13:56.243 --> 13:59.511
That means that part of your
liver is gonna save his life.

14:05.519 --> 14:06.951
My conditions, though.

14:06.953 --> 14:09.253
Yeah? This stays completely anonymous.

14:09.255 --> 14:12.390
There's a lot of people
that want to see me dead.

14:12.392 --> 14:14.125
You serious?

14:14.127 --> 14:18.629
I'm not gonna put my family
at risk again.

14:18.631 --> 14:21.364
We'll label you a John Doe
and book an OR.

14:21.366 --> 14:22.933
No. No, no.

14:22.935 --> 14:25.402
OR... that's with all those
windows. That's a lot of people.

14:25.404 --> 14:26.503
That's not gonna work.

14:26.505 --> 14:28.104
It's not gonna work.

14:28.106 --> 14:29.472
Okay, wait.
Okay, wait, wait!

14:29.474 --> 14:31.107
There has to be an alternative.

14:31.109 --> 14:32.708
To operating in an operating room?

14:32.710 --> 14:33.843
Yeah.

14:33.845 --> 14:35.711
What... what about the skills lab?

14:35.713 --> 14:37.112
What about it?

14:37.114 --> 14:39.415
Well, it... it could double as an OR

14:39.417 --> 14:41.050
in an emergency situation.

14:41.052 --> 14:42.585
This is not an emergency, Doc.

14:42.587 --> 14:44.119
It could become one real quick.

14:44.121 --> 14:45.788
You mentioned that, yeah.

14:45.790 --> 14:48.223
We'll put John Doe on the chart,
limit the staff,

14:48.225 --> 14:51.492
get Dawn to sign off on it,
and prep the skills lab.

14:51.494 --> 14:55.163
What do you say, Dr. Palmer,
want to save a life together?

15:03.127 --> 15:05.260
[Monitor beeping rhythmically]

15:05.262 --> 15:07.162
It's okay, baby.

15:11.601 --> 15:13.500
He's getting worse by the hour.

15:13.502 --> 15:15.202
Please tell me you have good news.

15:15.204 --> 15:18.405
We do. We got lucky, Joan.
A donor just came in.

15:18.407 --> 15:20.141
Took us a while to run the tests,

15:20.143 --> 15:21.942
but he's a perfect match for Colin.

15:21.944 --> 15:24.278
Really?

15:24.280 --> 15:25.746
Really.

15:25.748 --> 15:29.015
Um...

15:29.017 --> 15:30.817
Who's the donor?

15:30.819 --> 15:33.286
I want to thank them.
I-I need to thank them.

15:33.288 --> 15:34.854
Well, all donors are anonymous.

15:34.856 --> 15:36.656
I'll ask him if he wants to see you,

15:36.658 --> 15:37.957
but there are no guarantees.

15:37.959 --> 15:40.260
Him?

15:40.262 --> 15:42.762
- Mrs. Kilbride...
- Wait.

15:42.764 --> 15:44.697
So you're telling me that...

15:44.699 --> 15:47.032
in the last hour, you've managed
to find someone

15:47.034 --> 15:49.601
who's a perfect match for Colin?

15:51.172 --> 15:53.138
[clears throat]

15:55.342 --> 15:57.209
[voice breaking] It's him, isn't it?

15:57.211 --> 16:00.145
It's Danny.

16:00.147 --> 16:04.215
He came back.

16:07.187 --> 16:09.553
[sniffles] He came back for us.

16:09.555 --> 16:12.857
You obviously still care about him.

16:12.859 --> 16:14.992
Of course I do.

16:14.994 --> 16:16.727
Why else would I hate him
so much for leaving?

16:19.299 --> 16:22.132
The thing is we gotta keep
this under wraps, okay?

16:22.134 --> 16:23.834
Danny is nervous enough as it is.

16:23.836 --> 16:26.303
If he finds out that anyone else
knows he's here...

16:26.305 --> 16:28.205
he could take off.

16:28.207 --> 16:30.807
And it would be a serious
setback for Colin.

16:30.809 --> 16:33.109
Whatever you have to do.

16:33.111 --> 16:35.178
All right.

16:35.180 --> 16:37.913
But all he's talked about for years...

16:37.915 --> 16:40.449
is seeing his dad again.

16:40.451 --> 16:42.784
So you tell Danny that
he'll talk to his son,

16:42.786 --> 16:45.187
or so help me, God, I'll kill him myself.

16:57.968 --> 17:01.169
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:01.171 --> 17:03.037
I heard about your transplant patients.

17:03.039 --> 17:04.605
I'm so sorry.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.440
You had a brain-dead potential donor

17:06.442 --> 17:08.142
- come in this morning, right?
- Yep.

17:08.144 --> 17:10.310
- Type AB-positive?
- Yep.

17:10.313 --> 17:12.545
On a vent, waiting for a bus
to go to General.

17:12.547 --> 17:15.515
I think he could be waiting a while.

17:17.618 --> 17:20.319
I canceled it.

17:20.321 --> 17:24.790
But our new CEO clearly expressed...

17:24.792 --> 17:26.826
You're gonna do the transplant anyway?

17:26.828 --> 17:29.328
You should have seen Sally's face, Zach.

17:29.330 --> 17:30.763
I just...

17:30.765 --> 17:32.064
I couldn't do it.

17:32.066 --> 17:35.234
We do need to finish "War and Peace."

17:35.236 --> 17:36.802
Damn right.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.440
Do you think you could have
a few of your residents

17:41.442 --> 17:43.342
bring him up to the OR?

17:43.344 --> 17:45.277
Damn right.

17:51.551 --> 17:56.121
"Art is to console those
who are broken by life."

17:56.123 --> 17:59.657
- Kanye West?
- Van Gogh, actually.

17:59.659 --> 18:01.692
Which one of them do you
think was crazier?

18:01.694 --> 18:03.427
That is a toss-up.

18:03.429 --> 18:06.997
I'm gonna get you some water
for those anti-nauseants.

18:06.999 --> 18:08.399
Oh, no, that's okay.

18:08.401 --> 18:12.236
[Coughing]

18:12.238 --> 18:15.272
I saw that on a movie once,
and I really wanted to try it.

18:15.274 --> 18:17.374
It's a little harder than it looks.

18:17.376 --> 18:19.175
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

18:19.177 --> 18:21.610
I tried to get you a room on the ward,

18:21.612 --> 18:24.680
but day patients are pretty low
on the totem pole.

18:24.682 --> 18:27.917
Well, who knows, maybe this time,

18:27.919 --> 18:30.119
the pills will work and I won't spew

18:30.121 --> 18:33.389
all over some stranger's sedan.

18:34.559 --> 18:37.692
It's okay to be scared, Bree.

18:37.694 --> 18:40.963
I thought being alone would be better

18:40.965 --> 18:44.899
than Violet staying out of pity.

18:44.901 --> 18:47.135
But...

18:47.137 --> 18:51.739
well, it turns out I was wrong.

18:51.741 --> 18:53.607
You're not alone.

18:57.981 --> 19:00.147
How's it going? You guys almost ready?

19:00.149 --> 19:01.682
Getting there.

19:01.684 --> 19:03.784
It would be a lot faster
if we had an actual OR.

19:03.786 --> 19:05.586
She's not wrong.

19:05.588 --> 19:07.088
Why are we prepping in here
when OR 5 is free?

19:07.090 --> 19:09.723
Well, the new CEO wants to test it out.

19:09.725 --> 19:11.992
Might be another revenue stream.

19:11.994 --> 19:15.095
Maybe <i> he</i> should be the one
sterilizing everything by hand.

19:15.097 --> 19:19.065
Yeah. I'll let him know you said that.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.467
Wayne, come on, man.

19:20.469 --> 19:22.535
Let's prove to everyone
that anesthesiologists

19:22.537 --> 19:24.170
aren't as lame as everyone thinks.

19:24.172 --> 19:26.206
Spread your wings, brother.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.607
I'll get O'Toole to cover
your next two shifts.

19:28.609 --> 19:31.676
Flap. Flap.

19:31.678 --> 19:33.479
My man.

19:35.149 --> 19:37.182
You don't have to be scared.

19:37.184 --> 19:39.218
I'm gonna be sitting right outside.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.553
They're gonna take such good care of you.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.088
Okay, baby?

19:47.193 --> 19:49.627
Hi.

19:52.798 --> 19:54.232
[sighs]

19:54.234 --> 19:55.599
Hi.

20:07.212 --> 20:10.113
Say hello to your boy, Danny.

20:24.362 --> 20:26.462
Hello, little man.

20:26.464 --> 20:28.730
Do you remember me?

20:32.503 --> 20:34.537
Are you feeling okay?

20:36.573 --> 20:39.407
You look like crap, so... [chuckles]

20:39.409 --> 20:43.244
The doctor is gonna fix you up, though.

20:43.246 --> 20:46.681
With some help from daddy's liver.

20:48.418 --> 20:50.051
Yeah.

20:50.053 --> 20:53.687
Whatever's mine is yours.

20:56.024 --> 20:57.757
Just make sure he gets the part

20:57.759 --> 20:59.893
that didn't absorb all the tequila shots.

20:59.895 --> 21:02.362
I'll see what I can do.

21:04.366 --> 21:06.866
Same old Joanie.

21:06.868 --> 21:09.569
You haven't changed much yourself.

21:11.606 --> 21:14.173
We should get you both prepped and ready.

21:19.214 --> 21:20.246
Boom.

21:21.649 --> 21:22.915
Take care, son.

21:22.917 --> 21:24.783
You too.

21:24.785 --> 21:26.251
[Chuckles]

21:26.253 --> 21:28.052
Dad?

21:28.054 --> 21:29.921
Yeah?

21:29.923 --> 21:32.424
Will you be here when I wake up?

21:36.396 --> 21:37.929
Yep.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.366
Yes, I will.

21:50.276 --> 21:53.344
So we'll prep Colin while we
harvest the other liver,

21:53.346 --> 21:56.280
and when it's ready,
Colin's procedure will start.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.582
You really think this will work?

21:58.584 --> 22:00.050
I do.

22:13.298 --> 22:15.765
Dr. Bell, what do you think you're doing?

22:15.767 --> 22:17.699
Putting the patient's scans up

22:17.701 --> 22:19.834
in preparation for her transplant.

22:19.836 --> 22:22.371
After I ordered her transferred
to another hospital?

22:22.373 --> 22:24.439
Mrs. Ambrose's health is failing.

22:24.441 --> 22:26.275
It's my call for my patient.

22:26.277 --> 22:28.076
Her transfer has already been signed.

22:28.078 --> 22:30.779
If we operate on her, do you
have any idea of the liability?

22:30.781 --> 22:32.214
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

22:32.216 --> 22:34.348
Look, I'm sure she's a pet patient,

22:34.350 --> 22:35.683
but she is <i> one</i> patient.

22:35.685 --> 22:36.884
You're trying to save her,

22:36.886 --> 22:38.519
I'm trying to save this hospital.

22:38.521 --> 22:39.820
You need to call this off

22:39.822 --> 22:41.789
and get an ambulance here right now.

22:41.791 --> 22:43.658
You know, I'll, uh, make it easy
and do it for you.

22:43.660 --> 22:45.025
Stop.

22:45.027 --> 22:48.429
My patient is getting a new
heart... today, right here.

22:48.431 --> 22:50.298
I am seeing this through.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.566
Then I expect your resignation

22:52.568 --> 22:54.267
as Chief of Surgery by tomorrow morning.

23:05.318 --> 23:07.686
Woman: Clear for takeoff, Dr. Bell.

23:12.292 --> 23:13.457
You okay?

23:15.110 --> 23:16.794
Yeah, I just need a moment.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.130
[breathes deeply]

23:20.132 --> 23:22.633
[knock on door]

23:24.336 --> 23:25.936
Dr. Bell?

23:25.938 --> 23:28.105
We were wondering if we could assist.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.306
Do you both understand the risks
that you're taking?

23:30.308 --> 23:32.842
Yes, we do.

23:32.844 --> 23:35.211
Scrub up.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.327
Alex: Almost through
the left lateral segment.

23:52.329 --> 23:54.262
What do you think about the vasculature?

23:54.264 --> 23:56.965
These two hepatic arteries
are giving me some doubts.

23:56.967 --> 23:58.700
Nothing we can't handle, right?

23:58.702 --> 24:00.135
It's mostly the adult artery

24:00.137 --> 24:02.304
matching up with Colin
that I'm concerned with.

24:02.306 --> 24:05.039
Well, if it's too big,
you just punch a hole in it.

24:05.041 --> 24:06.607
You a... you calling me skinny?

24:06.609 --> 24:09.376
No. And I thought Danny here
was paranoid.

24:09.378 --> 24:12.046
Okay, we will do a modified
donor graft...

24:12.048 --> 24:14.348
unless you think I can't handle it.

24:14.350 --> 24:15.850
No.

24:18.855 --> 24:19.887
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:19.889 --> 24:21.555
I am so sorry about the wait time.

24:21.557 --> 24:22.856
We're doing the best we can.

24:22.858 --> 24:24.357
We'll be with you shortly.

24:24.359 --> 24:25.892
We're out of Albuterol, Naloxone,

24:25.894 --> 24:26.960
and tongue depressors.

24:26.962 --> 24:28.628
So call Don Valley, see if we can mooch,

24:28.630 --> 24:30.096
and tell him we're good for it.

24:30.098 --> 24:31.531
Yeah, we're not good for it.

24:31.533 --> 24:34.468
Jackson, I'm having a day that
rivals the Egyptian plagues.

24:34.470 --> 24:36.803
Just do me a favor, call, and lie, okay?

24:36.805 --> 24:40.739
[dogs barking]

24:40.741 --> 24:43.241
Oh, no. Sorry, ma'am.
No... no dogs allowed in here.

24:43.243 --> 24:45.644
No flea bags! Out! Go, bad dog!

24:45.646 --> 24:48.313
I'm sorry, but it's just my head.

24:48.315 --> 24:50.683
I really don't feel so good.

24:50.685 --> 24:52.818
Oh. No, no, wait!

24:52.820 --> 24:54.019
[barking intensifies]

24:54.021 --> 24:56.220
Oh!

24:58.992 --> 25:01.926
Pestilence!

25:01.928 --> 25:04.095
See, this is Mrs. Gleiberman's wrist.

25:04.097 --> 25:06.430
She broke that while, um, roller-blading.

25:06.432 --> 25:08.700
I didn't even know people still did that.

25:08.702 --> 25:11.102
And that is Mr. Barnham's elbow.

25:11.104 --> 25:14.237
He shattered that stage-diving
at the Mod Club,

25:14.239 --> 25:16.540
I think, when nobody caught him.

25:16.542 --> 25:18.274
Hmm.

25:23.382 --> 25:24.948
You can see me?

25:24.950 --> 25:27.450
Mm-hmm.

25:27.452 --> 25:29.585
Can he?

25:29.587 --> 25:32.021
I sincerely hope not.

25:32.023 --> 25:34.790
Summer! Thank you for coming back.

25:34.792 --> 25:35.791
Uh-huh.

25:35.793 --> 25:37.092
You said you wouldn't screw me,

25:37.094 --> 25:38.728
but your wife just almost fired me again.

25:38.730 --> 25:40.295
Well, she's not my wife.

25:40.297 --> 25:41.664
- What's up?
- That's a nice hat.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.399
I know, right?

25:43.401 --> 25:45.634
Okay, Lukey, time to go.
Bye-bye.

25:45.636 --> 25:46.768
Bye, buddy.

25:49.873 --> 25:53.808
Don't let him out of your life.

25:53.810 --> 25:55.243
It's true what they say.

25:55.245 --> 25:58.046
You don't know what you've got
until it's gone.

25:58.048 --> 25:59.881
You're still here?

26:10.225 --> 26:12.059
Who's that?

26:12.061 --> 26:14.962
I recognize him from somewhere.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.496
Follow him, go.

26:16.498 --> 26:17.531
What?

26:17.533 --> 26:19.766
Please, just do it.

26:32.013 --> 26:33.680
Uh...

26:33.682 --> 26:34.981
Eight, please.

26:37.150 --> 26:38.984
Ask him what he's doing here.

26:38.986 --> 26:41.620
So, you visiting someone or...

26:41.622 --> 26:44.489
Yeah.

26:44.491 --> 26:46.024
Ask who.

26:46.026 --> 26:51.597
Well, whoever it is,
I hope they're doing okay.

26:51.599 --> 26:55.066
My mom, yeah. She's... she's all right.

26:56.135 --> 26:59.269
[scoffs] Ask the time.

27:02.709 --> 27:04.575
Oh, damn it.

27:04.577 --> 27:06.777
You, uh... you got the proper time?

27:10.882 --> 27:12.582
Almost 2:00.

27:16.989 --> 27:19.055
[elevator dings]

27:19.057 --> 27:20.490
Thanks.

27:23.394 --> 27:26.362
So, what the hell
was that all about?

27:26.364 --> 27:28.196
Did you see that tattoo?

27:28.198 --> 27:29.464
Yeah.

27:29.466 --> 27:31.466
But having a lousy tattoo isn't a crime.

27:31.468 --> 27:34.903
He's here to kill me, man.

27:34.905 --> 27:36.605
You've gotta protect me.

27:36.607 --> 27:39.274
I can't do anything. I'm in surgery.

27:41.478 --> 27:42.845
Who's your doctor?

27:42.847 --> 27:45.113
Reid... Alex Reid.

27:58.003 --> 28:00.303
Alex, can I talk to you for a second?

28:00.305 --> 28:02.872
Kind of in the middle
of a transplant here.

28:02.874 --> 28:04.240
Listen, your patient's in danger.

28:04.242 --> 28:06.308
Someone's trying to kill him.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.277
We got it covered.

28:08.279 --> 28:10.279
No, you don't, actually.

28:10.281 --> 28:11.748
The minute you're done,

28:11.750 --> 28:14.316
you need to move the patient
and hide him somewhere safe.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.551
Put him Gerontology.

28:15.553 --> 28:16.986
They have vents and the staff
to monitor him.

28:16.988 --> 28:18.119
I'll have them clear a room.

28:21.958 --> 28:24.626
I'm sorry, but what the hell was that?

28:24.628 --> 28:26.027
Welcome to my world.

28:26.029 --> 28:28.263
Ice.

28:28.265 --> 28:32.066
Call OR 5, tell them to prep
Colin, we're on our way.

28:32.068 --> 28:34.968
So, Dr. Bell, just out
of curiosity's sake,

28:34.970 --> 28:37.438
how are you planning on
explaining this to the board?

28:37.440 --> 28:40.508
I'm not. Figured I'd let Sally
do that for me.

28:41.611 --> 28:44.177
Three, two...

28:44.179 --> 28:45.646
one.

28:46.816 --> 28:48.716
"Nothing is so necessary
for a young man"

28:48.718 --> 28:51.484
"as the company of intelligent women."

28:51.486 --> 28:53.753
"War and Peace." It's a gold mine.

28:53.755 --> 28:55.354
Amen to that one.

28:55.356 --> 28:57.256
Tolstoy must have had a good mother.

28:57.258 --> 28:58.291
[chuckles]

28:58.293 --> 29:00.092
[alarms ringing]

29:00.094 --> 29:01.661
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

29:01.663 --> 29:03.496
Pressure's in free-fall
and she's bucking the vent.

29:03.498 --> 29:07.033
Hypertension and pulmonary
vasoconstriction.

29:07.035 --> 29:08.600
- Hyper-rejection.
- It can't be.

29:08.602 --> 29:09.735
Her antibody screen was clean.

29:09.737 --> 29:11.437
Okay, we need to heparinize her again

29:11.439 --> 29:14.005
and get her back on pump or she
has no chance at transplant.

29:14.007 --> 29:15.373
Get those lines ready.

29:15.375 --> 29:16.842
[rapid beeping]

29:18.813 --> 29:22.113
Nobody but hospital staff with
badges comes into the room,

29:22.115 --> 29:23.749
and no visitors of any kind.

29:23.751 --> 29:25.383
- Got it.
- All right.

29:25.385 --> 29:29.286
- You sure this threat's legit?
- Well... [sighs]

29:29.288 --> 29:30.721
Better safe than sorry.

29:30.723 --> 29:32.256
How do you know all this?

29:32.258 --> 29:34.291
Just page me if anything changes.

29:37.396 --> 29:40.465
Bree. How are you feeling?

29:40.467 --> 29:43.399
Oh, I'll let you know when
the room stops spinning.

29:43.401 --> 29:45.936
I'll see you tomorrow, Dr. Lin.

29:45.938 --> 29:50.406
Uh, actually, Bree, I found you
a room for tonight.

29:50.408 --> 29:51.808
Oh, seriously?

29:51.810 --> 29:52.909
It's really close by,

29:52.911 --> 29:54.845
you can stay there for
as long as you need to

29:54.847 --> 29:56.312
until you feel better.

29:56.314 --> 29:58.615
Why are you doing all this for me?

29:58.617 --> 30:00.983
Because I'm your doctor?

30:00.985 --> 30:02.918
Let me take care of you.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.787
Okay.

30:04.789 --> 30:07.389
Uber drivers everywhere rejoice.

30:07.391 --> 30:09.959
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

30:09.961 --> 30:11.660
Come with me.

30:15.700 --> 30:18.633
How you feeling, Danny?

30:18.635 --> 30:21.703
Like I'm just coming off a bender.

30:21.705 --> 30:25.707
[chuckles] The anesthetic
packs quite the punch, huh?

30:25.709 --> 30:27.675
[chuckles]

30:27.677 --> 30:31.613
Well, your vitals all look good.

30:31.615 --> 30:34.080
How's the little man?

30:34.082 --> 30:35.649
How's Col?

30:35.651 --> 30:37.818
Good. Real good.

30:37.820 --> 30:39.953
Yeah, Dr. Reid's operating right now,

30:39.955 --> 30:42.890
transplanting a quarter of your liver.

30:42.892 --> 30:46.393
[chuckles] You're saving our son.

30:51.833 --> 30:52.965
I don't know.

30:52.967 --> 30:56.402
Maybe this is the drugs talking but...

30:56.404 --> 30:58.905
I want to try this again...

30:58.907 --> 31:00.673
us.

31:00.675 --> 31:02.675
Yeah.

31:02.677 --> 31:05.310
We can be like a little family again.

31:08.849 --> 31:10.314
Hey.

31:12.318 --> 31:15.654
And you can look after our little boy.

31:15.656 --> 31:18.523
Okay.

31:31.671 --> 31:33.604
All right, Danny.

31:33.606 --> 31:36.440
Best thing you could do
is sleep, my friend.

31:36.442 --> 31:38.308
I'm afraid to.

31:41.047 --> 31:43.980
I just got this bad feeling
something's gonna happen.

31:43.982 --> 31:46.348
Hey, hey...

31:46.350 --> 31:49.318
don't worry about a thing.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.888
We're gonna take care of Colin,
all right?

31:56.861 --> 31:59.194
[monitor flatlining]
[panting]

31:59.196 --> 32:01.463
You've been at that a while, Dr. Bell.

32:01.465 --> 32:03.565
- Do you want me to take over?
- Yeah.

32:03.567 --> 32:06.468
What is going on?
Give me an amp of epi.

32:13.376 --> 32:15.643
Okay, give it a second.

32:17.213 --> 32:18.445
[device beeping] Okay, it's fibrillating.

32:18.447 --> 32:20.481
Paddles.

32:20.483 --> 32:22.249
Charge to 10.

32:23.953 --> 32:25.352
[whirring]

32:27.590 --> 32:29.790
- Still V-fib.
- Okay, just needs some love.

32:29.792 --> 32:31.092
Charge to 20.

32:31.094 --> 32:32.759
[thump]

32:32.761 --> 32:34.728
[beeping continues]

32:34.730 --> 32:37.063
Third time's the charm.

32:37.065 --> 32:40.066
[whirring, thump]

32:40.068 --> 32:42.135
Come on, Sally.

32:42.137 --> 32:43.269
Come on.

32:47.776 --> 32:48.908
[beeping]

32:48.910 --> 32:52.077
[laughter]

32:52.079 --> 32:53.679
[sighs]

32:53.681 --> 32:56.248
Mr. Leffering can't fire you
after seeing this.

32:56.250 --> 32:59.652
