We're almost there.

00:31.039 --> 00:33.310
Come on, Reva,
hasn't a week of hiking

00:33.378 --> 00:34.981
been at all fun for you?

00:35.049 --> 00:36.752
I am in tech ops.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.988
I enjoy HDTV cameras
the size of dimes

00:39.055 --> 00:42.859
and playing with lasers.

00:42.926 --> 00:45.061
See, this is the greatest
part about our job.

00:45.129 --> 00:47.296
We fly halfway
around the world

00:47.364 --> 00:51.266
and spend a week
in an amazing place.

00:51.334 --> 00:53.302
Seeing things like this.

00:53.370 --> 00:55.738
It's very pretty.

00:55.806 --> 00:59.774
I'm sure it's also pretty when
you look at it on Google Earth.

00:59.842 --> 01:02.010
From...Yeah.

01:02.077 --> 01:03.544
If you don't like
being in the field,

01:03.612 --> 01:05.180
why'd you take
this assignment?

01:05.248 --> 01:07.385
Because it's
a great opportunity

01:07.453 --> 01:09.755
to shepherd a new piece
of technology.

01:09.822 --> 01:11.123
I mean,
you know what it means

01:11.191 --> 01:12.828
to build your bones
at the agency.

01:12.895 --> 01:15.397
You press for key missions,
succeed,

01:15.464 --> 01:16.633
and then ride that success

01:16.701 --> 01:18.001
all the way
to your own department

01:18.069 --> 01:19.770
where you no longer have
to go into the field.

01:21.139 --> 01:23.576
I think this is
as close as we can get

01:23.643 --> 01:25.077
to the Belarusian border
without crossing it.

01:25.145 --> 01:26.545
Excellent.

01:26.613 --> 01:28.147
You know
how many nights I spent

01:28.215 --> 01:31.751
at the lab triple-checking
every circuit

01:31.818 --> 01:34.321
and trying to impress
my supervisors

01:34.389 --> 01:36.456
by refining the filters?

01:36.524 --> 01:38.025
And now,
I don't know,

01:38.092 --> 01:40.126
it's just really, really cool

01:40.194 --> 01:44.264
to finally see
these things in action.

01:44.331 --> 01:46.666
Okay.

01:48.436 --> 01:50.472
Great, everything looks
good on my end.

01:50.539 --> 01:54.043
All right,
I'll call it in.

01:57.015 --> 01:59.016
Border photography
and logistics.

01:59.084 --> 02:00.450
This is your
Captain speaking.

02:00.518 --> 02:01.585
Hey, Aug.

02:01.653 --> 02:03.822
Last one fired
and ready to go.

02:03.889 --> 02:05.190
All right, hold on.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.059
You have it?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.461
Annie,
the signal's bouncing

02:08.529 --> 02:09.795
off of four different
satellites.

02:09.864 --> 02:11.197
You're gonna have
to give it a minute.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.399
Sorry.

02:12.467 --> 02:13.768
I'm a little excited
to get going.

02:13.836 --> 02:15.670
Finally get a chance
to hike the Orla Perc Trail

02:15.738 --> 02:17.272
on your way home,
huh, Walker?

02:17.340 --> 02:19.041
How did you know
I was gonna do that?

02:19.109 --> 02:21.143
When are you gonna realize
I know everything?

02:21.211 --> 02:22.512
I don't know
whether to be scared

02:22.580 --> 02:24.280
or oddly comforted
by that.

02:24.348 --> 02:26.683
Oh, comforted for sure,

02:26.751 --> 02:29.720
especially because I reworked
your travel back to Warsaw.

02:29.788 --> 02:31.288
The Polish government
is so grateful

02:31.356 --> 02:32.689
that we're sharing
these photos with them

02:32.757 --> 02:34.425
that they've offered you
a ride to the airport.

02:34.492 --> 02:37.094
Ah...Reva
will love you forever.

02:37.161 --> 02:39.163
Why is that?

02:39.230 --> 02:41.298
- Taxi to the airport.
- Hmm, I don't love Auggie,

02:41.365 --> 02:44.067
but I'm appreciative
of the ride.

02:44.135 --> 02:45.402
She's thinking about it.

02:45.470 --> 02:47.004
She's obsessed with me.

02:47.072 --> 02:48.272
All right,
we've got a feed.

02:48.340 --> 02:50.407
- Okay, are we good to go?
- Indeed.

02:50.475 --> 02:52.043
Enjoy the ride.
Get home safe.

02:52.110 --> 02:55.714
Will do.

02:55.782 --> 02:58.216
Mmm.

02:58.284 --> 03:00.018
All right,
let's get outta here.

03:00.086 --> 03:02.387
Hot shower, here I come.

03:06.827 --> 03:08.962
Wait, there's something
on the Belarusian side

03:09.030 --> 03:10.163
that's not on the map.

03:15.169 --> 03:18.171
Looks like a town, but there
aren't any people in it.

03:18.239 --> 03:21.608
That's weird.

03:26.180 --> 03:28.950
Reva.

03:29.017 --> 03:30.852
Reva.

03:35.524 --> 03:38.394

Damn it,
there's no internal latch.

04:52.389 --> 04:53.823
The best time for escape
is en route.

04:53.891 --> 04:55.259
I know.

04:55.326 --> 04:56.927
Otherwise our chances
of survival diminish greatly.

04:56.995 --> 04:58.395
I mean,
statistically speaking.

04:58.463 --> 05:00.164
Let's think.

05:00.232 --> 05:02.466
The rock camera was on.

05:02.534 --> 05:04.402
It would have caught
the license plate of the truck.

05:04.469 --> 05:05.670
Langley will see that

05:05.737 --> 05:07.204
and contact the Polish
embassy right away.

05:07.272 --> 05:10.141
Yes, except this truck
didn't have a license plate.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.077
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

05:12.144 --> 05:14.813
And no one's contacting
any embassy either.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.980
What--what do you mean?

05:16.048 --> 05:18.082
Those men weren't Polish.

05:18.150 --> 05:21.118
Their accents and uniforms
were straight out of Minsk.

05:21.186 --> 05:24.821
They're taking us
to Belarus.

05:24.888 --> 05:26.522
Those guys
were secret police?

05:26.590 --> 05:29.024
The last proud branch
of the Soviet militia.

05:31.828 --> 05:35.630
Okay, um,
we maintain our covers.

05:35.698 --> 05:37.199
That's protocol.

05:37.267 --> 05:39.735
We deny any knowledge of the
CIA's cooperation with Poland.

05:39.803 --> 05:42.104
We know nothing about
anyone smuggling weapons

05:42.172 --> 05:43.606
over any borders.

05:43.674 --> 05:46.476
Okay, we are just hikers.
That's all.

05:46.544 --> 05:48.545
It's gonna be okay.

05:48.613 --> 05:50.414
We were trained for this.

05:50.482 --> 05:52.317
Both of us.

05:52.384 --> 05:54.152
Remember the exercises
at the farm?

05:54.220 --> 05:56.321
Oh.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.356
I liked the ones where
you practice code breaking.

05:58.424 --> 06:01.861
I wasn't exactly good
at the field work.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.196
You know, the--

06:03.263 --> 06:05.064
You can do this.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.699
We can do this.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.769
Not because we calculate
the right statistics,

06:08.836 --> 06:11.672
but because
we work together.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.607
Yeah.

06:16.912 --> 06:19.013
What do you think
they want with us?

06:19.081 --> 06:20.581
I dunno.

06:20.649 --> 06:23.284
We're not the first hikers
taken by a foreign government.

06:23.351 --> 06:25.719
We make pretty good
bargaining chips.

06:29.424 --> 06:31.692
Tell me what you see.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.229
Annie and Reva
carefully obeyed the border,

06:35.297 --> 06:37.131
but the Belarusians
made an incursion into Poland

06:37.199 --> 06:38.433
to capture them.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.134
Have they made
any demands yet?

06:40.202 --> 06:42.203
No, but we expect
them soon.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.772
I wish we had people
in country.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.007
Do you want
to pull some operatives

06:45.075 --> 06:48.878
from St. Petersburg?

06:48.945 --> 06:50.946
I have a better idea.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.887
Your references
and experience

06:57.955 --> 07:00.022
are very impressive,
Mr. Wilcox.

07:00.090 --> 07:01.858
It seems like you will be
a great fit

07:01.926 --> 07:03.559
for our risk management
division.

07:03.627 --> 07:06.062
Thank you.
It would be a privilege.

07:06.129 --> 07:09.165
Well, I feel I have a good
sense of your strengths.

07:09.233 --> 07:10.967
So let's move on
to your weaknesses.

07:11.035 --> 07:14.270
Tell me about some mistakes
you've made in your career

07:14.338 --> 07:17.741
and how you'd strive
to avoid making them again.

07:17.808 --> 07:19.976
I don't know if this
qualifies as a mistake,

07:20.044 --> 07:23.813
but perhaps I've been
too much of a diplomat

07:23.881 --> 07:25.148
in the past.

07:27.952 --> 07:29.252
So sorry,
please ignore that.

07:35.059 --> 07:38.328
Please, excuse me.
I'll just be a moment.

07:43.367 --> 07:44.600
Hi, Joan.

07:44.668 --> 07:46.201
Just finishing a meeting
at London station.

07:46.269 --> 07:48.403
I know you had a job
interview in Berlin,

07:48.471 --> 07:50.305
but we can talk
about that later.

07:50.373 --> 07:51.507
Really, Joan, do we--

07:51.574 --> 07:52.808
Annie and Reva
have been captured.

07:52.876 --> 07:54.209
An incursion by
the Belarusians.

07:54.277 --> 07:56.111
I need you
to go to Poland.

07:56.178 --> 07:57.646
Of course.
What are the details?

07:57.713 --> 07:59.248
Auggie will send you
all the intel we have

07:59.316 --> 08:01.250
to your encrypted cell.

08:26.544 --> 08:28.879
Hello, young ladies.

08:28.947 --> 08:30.948
I'm Max Kupala.

08:31.016 --> 08:33.217
Welcome to Belarus.

08:33.284 --> 08:36.453
You are under arrest
for espionage.

08:36.522 --> 08:39.658
Sir, there has been
a terrible mistake.

08:39.726 --> 08:40.993
We are just hikers

08:41.061 --> 08:43.029
enjoying the beautiful
primeval forest

08:43.096 --> 08:44.397
you share with Poland.

08:44.465 --> 08:46.432
We never crossed the border
into your country.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.668
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.204
I'm sure you heard
of those Americans

08:50.271 --> 08:53.407
on the border of Iran,
Syria, and North Korea?

08:53.474 --> 08:56.877
They too said
they were just hikers.

08:56.944 --> 08:59.046
- I wouldn't know--
- Former U.S. Presidents

08:59.113 --> 09:01.615
flew halfway over the world
just to rescue them.

09:01.683 --> 09:05.619
They must be
very important hikers.

09:05.686 --> 09:07.754
Nice bag.
You bought this?

09:07.822 --> 09:10.089
Yeah, in--in a camping shop
in Toronto.

09:10.157 --> 09:12.858
Let's see what else
you bought here.

09:12.926 --> 09:15.561
Ah, Gayle Beacham.

09:15.629 --> 09:18.131
Hello.

09:18.198 --> 09:20.266
Look here.

09:22.336 --> 09:25.973
These readings
are sensitive

09:26.041 --> 09:28.376
within inches.

09:28.443 --> 09:32.714
So it must be pulling
from multiple satellites.

09:32.782 --> 09:34.749
Military satellites.

09:34.817 --> 09:38.219
You did not buy this
in a shop.

09:40.989 --> 09:42.389
Souvenir.

09:50.731 --> 09:52.998
We'll use only civilian-made
rides and weapons.

09:53.066 --> 09:55.100
This is off book.

09:55.168 --> 09:57.402
There are no post-mission
reports on this one.

09:57.470 --> 09:59.805
No paperwork of any kind.

09:59.872 --> 10:01.139
And if we crash
or are captured,

10:01.207 --> 10:03.041
there are no extraction
contingencies for us.

10:03.109 --> 10:05.911
Let's go.

10:23.897 --> 10:26.398
All right, we're honing in
on their GPS signal.

10:26.466 --> 10:28.334
Stay frosty.

10:28.401 --> 10:30.102
Gentlemen, scopes out
and scanning.

10:50.822 --> 10:52.155
There!

10:52.223 --> 10:53.423
Go, go, go, go, go.

10:53.490 --> 10:55.091
Do not lose that truck.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.075
Check those guys out.

12:00.155 --> 12:02.056
Where are the two women
you were carrying?

12:02.124 --> 12:03.891
Ned, translate for me.

12:03.959 --> 12:05.592
Tell him to get out
of the truck.

12:05.660 --> 12:06.794
His friend too!

12:09.797 --> 12:11.097
Where are the two women
you were carrying?

12:14.968 --> 12:16.502
He says he doesn't know
about any women.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.673
The secret police
paid him to drive this truck

12:21.741 --> 12:23.008
from Hrodna to Pinsk.

12:28.448 --> 12:32.117
Joan, I found Annie's GPS,
but no Annie.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.189
Where are we?

13:13.901 --> 13:15.202
This is a terrible mistake.

13:15.269 --> 13:16.970
We're just hikers.
I promise.

13:17.038 --> 13:18.338
I've never met a spy,

13:18.405 --> 13:21.007
but I imagine they look
nothing like us.

13:22.409 --> 13:23.509
Sit.

13:27.580 --> 13:30.582
If I could just call
the Canadian embassy,

13:30.650 --> 13:33.118
I'm sure we could
sort this out.

13:33.185 --> 13:35.453
There will probably be
a reward for our safe return

13:35.521 --> 13:39.257
and your hospitality,
of course.

13:39.325 --> 13:43.995
There are many problems
with everything you say.

13:44.063 --> 13:47.598
But let us start with
the problem of the phone.

13:47.666 --> 13:50.100
There is no phone.

13:50.168 --> 13:54.305
If there was,
I would not let you use it.

13:54.372 --> 13:57.608
If there was a phone
and I did let you use it,

13:57.676 --> 13:59.511
it would be tapped.

13:59.579 --> 14:02.047
So whatever you have to say
to the Canadian embassy,

14:02.114 --> 14:05.317
you can say to me.

14:13.094 --> 14:15.662
Nothing to say?

14:15.730 --> 14:20.500
You see, the lack of a phone
is not your problem.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.535
Please, you don't have
to do this.

14:25.672 --> 14:28.506
First we eat.

14:40.453 --> 14:43.055
Thank you.
<i>Spasibo.</i>

14:59.474 --> 15:01.876
Stop.
That could be poisoned.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.378
They have had
multiple opportunities

15:03.446 --> 15:04.879
to kill us already.

15:04.947 --> 15:08.383
They're feeding us
'cause they need us alive.

15:08.451 --> 15:11.486
Besides, it's rude to not eat
what you're served.

15:11.554 --> 15:14.589
Well, I wouldn't want
to be rude to our kidnappers.

15:14.657 --> 15:16.692
Eat.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.527
I promise you,
it's not poisoned.

15:34.246 --> 15:35.947
How much are they asking?

15:36.015 --> 15:38.116
The Belarusian's cable
demands $60 million

15:38.184 --> 15:39.751
for Annie and Reva's
safe return.

15:39.819 --> 15:41.386
It's couched
as urgent economic aid,

15:41.454 --> 15:42.921
but we all know
what that means.

15:42.988 --> 15:44.956
It'll go straight into the
pockets of the secret police.

15:45.024 --> 15:47.258
Nevertheless, how quickly
can we send the money?

15:47.326 --> 15:49.361
We can set up an untraceable
offshore account and wire--

15:49.429 --> 15:50.796
Before we get to that,

15:50.864 --> 15:53.698
Joan, what were your people
even doing there?

15:53.766 --> 15:57.736
We were putting eyes
on an extremely porous border.

15:57.804 --> 15:59.537
We suspect large caches
of weapons

15:59.605 --> 16:00.939
have been traveling over it

16:01.006 --> 16:02.240
from Central Asia
into Europe.

16:02.308 --> 16:03.774
I just wish you'd given us
a heads-up.

16:03.842 --> 16:06.444
The state department could
have worked with you on this.

16:06.511 --> 16:08.612
So is that why
you're dragging your heels,

16:08.680 --> 16:10.614
because we didn't
read you in?

16:10.682 --> 16:12.316
No, it's just that
we would strongly prefer

16:12.384 --> 16:14.485
to wire the funds
as a last resort.

16:14.552 --> 16:15.819
My operatives
have been captured.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.755
In your view, what does
a last resort look like?

16:17.823 --> 16:19.257
It's what happens
after diplomacy fails,

16:19.324 --> 16:20.691
but we haven't tried yet.

16:20.759 --> 16:22.527
One of my undersecretaries
can go to Minsk.

16:22.594 --> 16:25.297
We don't have time
for diplomacy.

16:25.365 --> 16:28.601
Pay the money.

16:28.669 --> 16:29.936
If you're not comfortable
with that,

16:30.004 --> 16:31.271
I can send
an extraction team.

16:31.339 --> 16:33.240
A military presence would be
even more problematic.

16:33.307 --> 16:34.808
So you're telling me

16:34.875 --> 16:36.543
that the state department
is not permitting me

16:36.611 --> 16:39.847
to pursue either option
to bring my people home?

16:39.914 --> 16:41.448
Give me two days.

16:41.516 --> 16:42.716
If our negotiations aren't
fruitful by then,

16:42.784 --> 16:43.984
we'll send the money.

16:44.052 --> 16:45.219
And you can guarantee
my officers' safety

16:45.287 --> 16:46.587
until that time?

16:46.654 --> 16:48.522
Joan, I have all my available
resources on this.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.524
We take this situation
very seriously, I assure you.

16:50.592 --> 16:53.861
I don't want assurances.
I want my people safe.

17:00.535 --> 17:02.069
Joan.

17:02.137 --> 17:04.171
State department
wants me to pull you back.

17:04.239 --> 17:06.207
You want me
to pull back now?

17:06.275 --> 17:08.041
I said that's what
they wanted.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.910
I want you to remain
in country.

17:09.978 --> 17:12.012
Just find them, quick.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.181
Check over there.

17:37.839 --> 17:40.073
Thank you.

17:40.141 --> 17:44.612
So what's it like
to work for the CIA?

17:44.680 --> 17:46.881
I wouldn't know.

17:46.949 --> 17:49.585
I work in a travel bookshop
in Toronto.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.654
But for being
an American hiker,

17:52.722 --> 17:55.557
you know a lot
about this country.

17:55.625 --> 17:56.892
Huh?

17:56.960 --> 17:58.159
I'm not American.

17:58.227 --> 18:00.795
I'm sorry.
Canadian.

18:00.863 --> 18:03.898
I wanted to visit your country
for a long time.

18:03.966 --> 18:08.402
I admire the Belarusian
people very much.

18:08.470 --> 18:10.070
Yeah, we're organized,
hard-working.

18:10.138 --> 18:12.406
Very kind to foreigners.

18:12.473 --> 18:17.043
Your country has been sold,
stolen, borrowed,

18:17.111 --> 18:19.213
occupied, and destroyed

18:19.281 --> 18:21.582
by everyone from
the Vikings to Stalin.

18:21.650 --> 18:24.653
Even now you only exist
because Russia allows you to.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.023
Eh, you learned all that
in a travel book store?

18:28.091 --> 18:30.693
I like to read about
the places I'm gonna visit.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.796
Is that also where
you learned to speak Russian

18:33.864 --> 18:36.565
like a school girl
from Minsk?

18:36.633 --> 18:38.033
I like research.

18:38.101 --> 18:39.702
Research?

18:39.770 --> 18:43.072
This is not research.

18:43.140 --> 18:47.743
You didn't read a guidebook
about my home country.

18:47.811 --> 18:52.515
You read the CIA files.

18:52.583 --> 18:55.484
And they are pretty good
in analyzing

18:55.552 --> 18:59.021
the vulnerabilities
of a people, right, huh?

19:01.156 --> 19:03.624
I just wish
you could appreciate us

19:03.692 --> 19:08.161
for more than just
our resilience.

19:08.229 --> 19:11.631
We make a world-class
motorcycle.

19:11.699 --> 19:14.333
After being held
against my will,

19:14.401 --> 19:16.169
I think I'll buy
a Harley.

19:16.236 --> 19:19.338
You better watch
your pretty mouth.

19:19.406 --> 19:21.974
I work for my government

19:22.042 --> 19:24.444
just like you
work for yours.

19:24.512 --> 19:26.379
We both have a job to do.

19:26.447 --> 19:27.681
Right?

19:27.748 --> 19:30.217
Yours is to
come here uninvited,

19:30.284 --> 19:32.085
and mine is to use
your presence

19:32.153 --> 19:33.687
to help my country.

19:33.754 --> 19:35.122
You're not gonna
help your country.

19:35.189 --> 19:36.489
The money you get from this

19:36.557 --> 19:38.258
will go directly
to the secret police.

19:38.325 --> 19:43.163
And you'll get, what, 15%?

19:43.230 --> 19:45.197
Ten.

19:45.265 --> 19:47.966
In both of our agencies,

19:48.034 --> 19:51.169
we have to work very hard
to prove our worth,

19:51.237 --> 19:54.172
to separate ourselves
from our colleagues, right?

19:54.239 --> 19:56.941
I like working
with my colleagues.

19:57.009 --> 19:58.877
I have a family.

19:58.944 --> 20:00.612
And to support them,

20:00.680 --> 20:03.415
I have to prove myself
all the time.

20:03.483 --> 20:05.884
I hope your agency understands

20:05.952 --> 20:09.222
the simplicity of that.

20:12.260 --> 20:14.594
Like I said,

20:14.662 --> 20:16.563
I don't have an agency.

20:21.268 --> 20:24.403
Then you will not stay here
for much longer

20:24.470 --> 20:28.439
in this cozy little house.

20:28.507 --> 20:30.575
You have a good night.

20:34.579 --> 20:35.378
<i>Spasiba.</i>

20:44.622 --> 20:46.089
I know auntie Annie

20:46.157 --> 20:48.625
has some stickers
in here somewhere.

20:48.692 --> 20:50.727
I want the elephant ones.

20:50.795 --> 20:53.796
I know you do, sweetie.
We'll find them.

20:53.864 --> 20:57.166
All right, now if I was
an elephant sticker,

20:57.234 --> 20:59.902
I would be there.

21:07.710 --> 21:09.177
Mommy, did you find it?

21:09.245 --> 21:10.612
No, I didn't, sweetie.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.047
Why don't you guys run along
and get a snack?

21:12.114 --> 21:14.216
And I will be right there.

21:20.957 --> 21:23.993
You've reached Annie Walker
at the Smithsonian Institution.

21:24.061 --> 21:25.561
If I am out of the office,

21:25.629 --> 21:27.263
these messages will forward
to my cell.

21:27.331 --> 21:28.898
Thank you.

21:28.966 --> 21:31.735
Yeah, hi, Annie,
it's your sister.

21:31.803 --> 21:33.036
Little oops.

21:33.104 --> 21:34.705
You left your passport here.

21:34.773 --> 21:36.173
I know you've been
in New York all week,

21:36.241 --> 21:38.042
so you probably didn't
realize it's gone.

21:38.109 --> 21:39.710
But if you're planning
on traveling to Edinburgh

21:39.778 --> 21:41.246
for work tomorrow,
you're gonna need it.

21:41.313 --> 21:42.480
Call me right away
so I can figure out

21:42.548 --> 21:43.848
how I can get it to you.

21:43.916 --> 21:46.151
Okay?
Bye.

21:59.965 --> 22:02.066
Follow my lead.

23:27.955 --> 23:33.058
♪ <i>Kupalinka, kupalinka ♪</i>

23:36.195 --> 23:41.968
♪ ♪

24:21.395 --> 24:22.595
You okay?

24:22.663 --> 24:25.331
My stride
is roughly 3 feet,

24:25.399 --> 24:29.636
times an average of
1,700 steps per hour.

24:29.703 --> 24:31.204
Plus breaks.

24:31.272 --> 24:33.540
Based on the general
topography,

24:33.608 --> 24:37.677
I'd say we've gone
about nine miles so far.

24:37.745 --> 24:39.279
That actually helps me.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.781
Helps you do what?

24:40.848 --> 24:42.115
Plan our route.

24:42.183 --> 24:44.184
We've been heading southwest
all morning.

24:44.252 --> 24:46.754
Now we can either go west
towards Brest

24:46.822 --> 24:48.656
and cross the border
before we hit the city

24:48.724 --> 24:50.658
or we can go south
towards Ukraine.

24:50.726 --> 24:52.293
Poland's closer.

24:52.361 --> 24:53.895
There's a U.S. military base

24:53.963 --> 24:55.931
and an embassy
with a record of our visas

24:55.998 --> 24:57.065
and a direct flight home.

24:57.133 --> 24:58.533
So it's expected,

24:58.601 --> 25:00.302
and the secret police
will be looking for us there.

25:00.369 --> 25:01.870
It's also where
the CIA will find us.

25:01.938 --> 25:03.905
Langley doesn't know this
country like the secret police.

25:03.973 --> 25:05.407
In a crisis,
we should stick to protocol.

25:05.475 --> 25:07.008
We have a greater chance
of being rescued.

25:07.076 --> 25:10.512
Reva, we can't count
on being rescued.

25:10.580 --> 25:12.747
We can't assume
that the secret police

25:12.815 --> 25:15.582
won't cross other borders
to come after us.

25:15.650 --> 25:18.753
Doing the unexpected thing
is the safer choice.

25:18.821 --> 25:20.488
If we get caught again,
they will not take us

25:20.556 --> 25:22.624
to some country house
in the forest.

25:22.691 --> 25:24.592
They'll take us to prison.

25:28.097 --> 25:30.265
Uh-huh.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.767
Okay, fine.

25:32.835 --> 25:35.304
But I'm gonna keep
counting our steps.

25:35.372 --> 25:38.274
I expected nothing less.

25:38.341 --> 25:40.209
Auggie, just got
your message.

25:40.276 --> 25:41.777
Branch, thanks
for coming down.

25:41.845 --> 25:43.079
I need a favor.

25:43.146 --> 25:44.213
A sister of one of my ops

25:44.281 --> 25:45.481
found her old passport.

25:45.548 --> 25:46.716
A NOC passport?

25:46.783 --> 25:48.117
Nope, civilian.

25:48.185 --> 25:50.186
But my operative's cover
is that she's overseas,

25:50.253 --> 25:51.754
and I don't want
her sister to keep digging.

25:51.822 --> 25:53.155
What do you need?

25:53.223 --> 25:54.490
Who do you know at
the Scottish affairs office?

25:54.558 --> 25:55.724
I know everyone.

25:55.792 --> 25:57.526
Then I came
to the right man.

25:59.997 --> 26:01.864
Hi, Joan.

26:01.932 --> 26:04.299
We hit a small snag.

26:04.367 --> 26:05.401
- Bad weather?
- No.

26:05.469 --> 26:07.403
But the old saying's true:

26:07.470 --> 26:11.941
What goes up must come down.

26:12.009 --> 26:14.844
We are going to have
to re-rig the fuel control.

26:14.912 --> 26:16.546
How long will that take?

26:16.614 --> 26:17.914
Ned, how long
is this gonna take?

26:17.982 --> 26:19.382
All day.

26:19.450 --> 26:21.751
Not long.
It's not a problem.

26:21.819 --> 26:24.154
Okay, because I'm not only
lying to the state department

26:24.221 --> 26:25.855
but to several
members of Congress

26:25.923 --> 26:27.858
about your very existence
in Belarus.

26:27.926 --> 26:30.261
I need you to work quickly
and very quietly.

26:30.328 --> 26:31.629
If the secret police
find out you're there,

26:31.697 --> 26:34.199
it could jeopardize
Annie and Reva's safety.

26:34.266 --> 26:36.267
Understood.

26:46.512 --> 26:48.412
I don't think
you understand.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.815
This is a very serious
situation.

26:50.883 --> 26:52.517
My sister works
for the Smithsonian,

26:52.584 --> 26:53.985
and she was supposed
to travel yesterday

26:54.053 --> 26:55.286
to Edinburgh on business,

26:55.354 --> 26:56.421
but she's forgotten
her passport.

26:56.488 --> 26:57.555
See, here it is.

26:57.623 --> 26:58.589
She's not answering her phone,

26:58.657 --> 26:59.991
and I can only assume

27:00.058 --> 27:01.993
that she's in some sort
of airport security jail.

27:02.060 --> 27:03.995
Is your sister a criminal?

27:04.062 --> 27:06.497
She's traveling
without a passport.

27:06.565 --> 27:07.766
What else
would they do with her?

27:07.833 --> 27:08.767
Look, she's been
all over the world,

27:08.835 --> 27:10.168
but she has no survival skills

27:10.236 --> 27:11.770
to handle a crisis
like this.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.138
As I've explained already,

27:13.206 --> 27:14.373
it's not possible
to enter Scotland

27:14.440 --> 27:15.707
without a valid passport.

27:15.775 --> 27:17.175
If your sister
doesn't have it with her,

27:17.243 --> 27:18.510
then she's not in Scotland.

27:18.578 --> 27:19.945
Well, then where is she?

27:20.012 --> 27:21.647
You know what, it's all right.
I got this.

27:21.714 --> 27:23.516
Oh, my apologies.

27:23.583 --> 27:25.350
My name is Andrew,

27:25.418 --> 27:27.286
and I work directly
with the ambassador.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.488
How may I help you?

27:28.555 --> 27:29.989
My sister, Annie Walker,

27:30.057 --> 27:31.858
is supposed to be traveling
to Scotland on business.

27:31.926 --> 27:33.994
She's forgotten her passport.

27:34.061 --> 27:35.329
So it's very important
that I get it to her.

27:35.396 --> 27:39.267
Oh, of course.
Oh, let's see.

27:39.334 --> 27:40.768
She's booked on
a British Airways flight

27:40.836 --> 27:42.403
connecting through London.

27:42.471 --> 27:44.005
Huh.

27:44.073 --> 27:46.741
I see here that the U.S.
consulate in Edinburgh

27:46.809 --> 27:49.377
issued her temporary paperwork
to allow her to enter.

27:49.444 --> 27:50.745
Oh!

27:50.813 --> 27:52.480
Thank goodness.

27:52.548 --> 27:55.182
I'd be happy to Fedex this
to her via the consulate.

27:55.250 --> 27:57.285
They will contact her
tomorrow about picking it up.

27:57.352 --> 27:59.354
Don't worry.

27:59.422 --> 28:00.922
Well, thank you.

28:00.990 --> 28:02.791
I can't tell you
what a relief this is.

28:02.858 --> 28:04.994
My pleasure.

28:12.601 --> 28:14.903
Auggie, it's Andrew.

28:14.970 --> 28:20.241
You owe me a very nice bottle
of single malt, my friend.

28:26.749 --> 28:27.916
What are you doing?

28:27.984 --> 28:29.717
Do you hear
someone coming?

28:29.785 --> 28:32.286
No, I'm just checking
to see if the water's safe.

28:32.354 --> 28:35.089
We're upstream,
and it's constantly moving.

28:35.157 --> 28:37.457
No industry in the area.

28:43.297 --> 28:44.998
Yeah, that's what
water should taste like.

28:45.065 --> 28:46.632
Go ahead.

28:51.571 --> 28:53.772
Mmm.

28:53.840 --> 28:56.208
I always used to make fun
of my crunchy granola friends

28:56.276 --> 28:58.111
for taking bottles down
to the stream to collect water,

28:58.178 --> 29:00.747
but now I get it.

29:00.814 --> 29:03.984
Still don't get
tempeh though.

29:07.690 --> 29:11.059
Uh, dark berries
growing in the forest.

29:11.127 --> 29:14.029
There's a 79% chance
those will kill you.

29:14.097 --> 29:16.598
They're black elderberries.

29:16.666 --> 29:18.166
They're delicious.
They're not poisonous.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.335
Also good
for fighting the flu.

29:20.403 --> 29:23.171
That information
wasn't available at the farm

29:23.238 --> 29:25.206
or in the CIA file.

29:25.274 --> 29:28.242
My dad was in the military,
so we moved around a lot.

29:28.310 --> 29:30.044
When I was little,
he was stationed in Sweden,

29:30.112 --> 29:32.514
and there were a bunch
of fruit trees on the base.

29:32.581 --> 29:36.051
My sister taught me
which ones were safe to eat.

29:36.118 --> 29:38.486
In the summer,
we'd stuff ourselves.

29:38.554 --> 29:41.923
My mom loved to bake
berry pie.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.258
We usually ate them all
before she could.

29:48.631 --> 29:52.201
Reva, look.
Potato farm.

29:52.269 --> 29:53.802
I bet we'd get
some real food

29:53.870 --> 29:55.271
and a warm place
to sleep.

29:55.338 --> 29:56.972
We're losing the light.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.607
Are you kidding?

29:58.674 --> 30:00.375
Why would I be?

30:00.443 --> 30:01.843
We're fugitives,

30:01.911 --> 30:03.345
political prisoners
on the run

30:03.412 --> 30:05.980
from the secret police who have
charged us with espionage.

30:06.048 --> 30:07.648
Look, we're not going up
to some strangers

30:07.716 --> 30:10.050
in the middle of nowhere
to ask for potatoes.

30:10.118 --> 30:11.484
These are Roma people.

30:11.552 --> 30:12.752
They've been oppressed
by the government for centuries.

30:12.820 --> 30:13.853
They're not gonna report us.

30:13.921 --> 30:16.322
How do you know that?

30:16.390 --> 30:18.291
- 'Cause I know.
- So what's your plan?

30:18.359 --> 30:20.226
You're just gonna walk up
and introduce yourself,

30:20.294 --> 30:22.662
explain to them
that we just so happen

30:22.729 --> 30:24.764
to have lost all of our
hiking gear, money,

30:24.832 --> 30:26.665
and identification?

30:26.733 --> 30:28.434
Yeah.

30:28.501 --> 30:30.269
Good luck.

30:30.336 --> 30:31.870
Where are you going?

30:31.938 --> 30:34.139
Back to Poland.
That's what procedure dictates.

30:34.206 --> 30:35.573
And that's what we
shoulda done before.

30:35.641 --> 30:37.174
Don't you understand?

30:37.242 --> 30:39.777
That's where the secret police
will be looking for us.

30:39.844 --> 30:41.311
Great.
Let them find me.

30:41.379 --> 30:43.480
Because then they'll make an
official demand for my release,

30:43.547 --> 30:44.714
and the CIA
will pay for it.

30:44.782 --> 30:46.015
Better that
than wandering around

30:46.083 --> 30:47.650
in the wilderness
eating berries.

30:47.718 --> 30:49.385
Reva, come on.
We talked about this.

30:49.453 --> 30:51.087
We can't let fear
lead to bad decisions

30:51.155 --> 30:53.022
or to not trusting
each other.

30:53.090 --> 30:54.557
Please, be careful.

30:54.625 --> 30:55.692
Don't follow me.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.627
I'm not gonna
leave you here.

30:57.695 --> 30:59.362
Neither of us
should be alone!

30:59.430 --> 31:00.363
Reva!

31:02.967 --> 31:04.100
Annie.

31:04.168 --> 31:07.737
I'm here.

31:07.804 --> 31:11.474
Okay, I need you to answer
a few basic questions.

31:11.542 --> 31:13.242
What's your name?

31:13.310 --> 31:14.978
Reva Kline.

31:15.045 --> 31:17.313
Where are you?

31:17.380 --> 31:21.116
Unfortunately
still in Belarus.

31:21.184 --> 31:23.285
Let me help you up.

31:32.994 --> 31:35.061
Okay.

31:38.466 --> 31:41.368
Ugh, damn it.

31:41.436 --> 31:45.406
Okay, all we have to do
is make it across that field.

31:45.474 --> 31:46.707
I know that you think

31:46.775 --> 31:48.342
that going to the farm
is a bad idea,

31:48.410 --> 31:52.214
but you're hurt
and we need help.

31:52.282 --> 31:54.383
I'm right
about these people.

31:54.451 --> 31:55.984
I'd bet my life on it.

31:56.052 --> 31:59.354
Introducing ourselves
to strangers out here

31:59.422 --> 32:02.757
means betting
both of our lives.

32:02.825 --> 32:05.259
I understand.

32:05.326 --> 32:07.394
Come on.

32:34.791 --> 32:36.725
Zira.

32:36.735 --> 32:38.636
Zira.

33:45.073 --> 33:46.506
Reva.
What?

33:46.574 --> 33:47.841
Wake up.
They're coming for us.

33:47.909 --> 33:51.011
We gotta get out of here.
What?

33:51.079 --> 33:53.213
I'll help you.

34:13.264 --> 34:15.099
No.

34:51.670 --> 34:54.407
- Auggie.
- Any news?

34:54.475 --> 34:56.342
The Belarusians
sent a new cable

34:56.409 --> 34:57.777
changing their demands.

34:57.844 --> 34:59.812
Instead of $60 million,
they now want 80 million.

34:59.879 --> 35:02.248
And they changed the timeline
we have to deliver.

35:02.316 --> 35:04.517
They want the money
in 24 hours

35:04.585 --> 35:06.886
or Annie and Reva will be
sent to a government prison.

35:06.954 --> 35:08.121
That's strange.

35:08.188 --> 35:10.123
Prison is a standard
leverage play.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.458
No, I mean, why are
they changing the terms

35:11.525 --> 35:12.926
so late in the game?

35:12.993 --> 35:14.861
They have no reason to think
we won't send the money.

35:14.928 --> 35:16.361
Unless...
What?

35:16.429 --> 35:20.732
Unless they've escaped.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.700
Demanding more money
in less time

35:22.768 --> 35:24.369
is supposed
to make us panic.

35:24.436 --> 35:25.737
That way
we'll send the funds

35:25.804 --> 35:27.238
before our operatives
find a way to report in.

35:27.306 --> 35:30.775
It'd be brilliant
if it wasn't so desperate.

35:30.842 --> 35:32.444
I can't act on that.
It's just conjecture.

35:34.246 --> 35:36.080
- Jai.
- Auggie, is Joan there?

35:36.148 --> 35:37.416
Right here.

35:37.483 --> 35:38.717
There are rumors
throughout the countryside

35:38.785 --> 35:40.586
of two foreign women
traveling alone.

35:40.654 --> 35:42.521
Their descriptions
match Annie and Reva's.

35:42.589 --> 35:44.023
Wherever they were
being held,

35:44.091 --> 35:45.692
they've escaped.
I just said that!

35:45.760 --> 35:47.961
Nothing?
Nobody?

35:48.029 --> 35:49.029
Okay.

35:49.096 --> 35:50.464
Joke all you want,

35:50.531 --> 35:52.098
but our situation
on the ground

35:52.166 --> 35:53.733
requires that we
be very creative.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.902
What do you mean
"on the ground"?

35:56.970 --> 35:59.104
Just a figure of speech.

35:59.172 --> 36:00.805
Hey, if you need it,

36:00.873 --> 36:03.708
I've got some ideas
about where they're headed.

36:08.546 --> 36:10.213
I don't think
I can go any further.

36:10.281 --> 36:12.115
Yes, you can.
I know you can.

36:12.183 --> 36:14.484
All right.

36:21.292 --> 36:24.528
Come on, come on.
Come on.

36:24.596 --> 36:25.964
Here, I got you.
Come on.

36:29.702 --> 36:31.904
Come on.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.072
Whoa, whoa.

36:35.208 --> 36:37.643
Look, we have to get
across that river.

36:37.710 --> 36:40.012
We can walk back downstream
and cross at a lower point,

36:40.079 --> 36:42.614
but with them after us,
we don't have time.

36:42.681 --> 36:43.648
Okay.

36:43.716 --> 36:45.049
We have to jump.

36:45.117 --> 36:46.751
I know it's scary.

36:46.818 --> 36:48.585
But on the other side
of that river is the Ukraine.

36:48.653 --> 36:50.087
We can contact
the CIA station

36:50.155 --> 36:52.122
and get a flight home.

36:52.190 --> 36:53.657
I know you can do it.

36:53.724 --> 36:56.226
Yeah.
Yeah, I can.

36:56.294 --> 36:58.729
Fear only prevents us
from making clear decisions

36:58.796 --> 37:00.664
in the moment, right?
Right.

37:07.371 --> 37:11.374
Besides,
I swam varsity at USC.

37:11.442 --> 37:12.275
Come on.

37:27.143 --> 37:30.079
You okay?

37:45.802 --> 37:47.336
Come on,
we're almost there.

37:47.404 --> 37:49.906
No, my leg.
I think it's broken.

37:49.973 --> 37:51.641
Put your arm over--

37:51.709 --> 37:52.976
That's Max.

37:53.043 --> 37:54.743
Annie, they're here, okay?

37:54.811 --> 37:57.445
They found a way
across the river.

37:59.782 --> 38:01.817
It's Jai.

38:01.884 --> 38:03.284
Come on, come on.

38:14.027 --> 38:15.227
Hey.

38:32.379 --> 38:34.046
It seems Belarus
is using this fake village

38:34.114 --> 38:35.714
as a holding station

38:35.782 --> 38:37.083
for weapons and vehicles

38:37.150 --> 38:39.252
destined for hostile nations.

38:39.319 --> 38:42.021
The CIA and Warsaw have been
informed of this development.

38:42.089 --> 38:43.590
They will be sending
operatives to the area

38:43.657 --> 38:45.091
for further investigation.

38:45.159 --> 38:47.927
Our case officers
should be very proud

38:47.995 --> 38:49.295
of their good work.

38:54.001 --> 38:54.934
Phew.

38:55.002 --> 38:57.303
Hey, congratulations

38:57.371 --> 39:00.040
on your promotion to
the advanced technology desk.

39:00.107 --> 39:01.541
They're lucky to have you.

39:01.609 --> 39:02.876
Thanks.

39:02.944 --> 39:04.511
Maybe we can
work together again.

39:04.579 --> 39:06.313
Although I'd prefer for you
to be the one in the field.

39:07.091 --> 39:10.613
I mean-- Clearly you don't need
anyone to count your steps for you.

39:12.955 --> 39:15.122
I'll see you.

39:18.793 --> 39:20.160
Auggie.

39:20.228 --> 39:21.695
Hey there.

39:21.763 --> 39:23.564
- Walk with me.
- All right.

39:23.631 --> 39:25.332
I heard about Danielle.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.667
I'm so sorry for all
the trouble I caused you.

39:27.735 --> 39:29.902
Well Branch did
most of the legwork.

39:29.970 --> 39:31.537
Well, I'll apologize
to him then.

39:31.605 --> 39:33.272
Uh-huh, hey,
don't you ever apologize

39:33.340 --> 39:34.706
for any of it.

39:34.774 --> 39:37.076
You have someone in your life
who cares about you,

39:37.143 --> 39:38.744
who would take
an entire day

39:38.812 --> 39:40.613
to go down
to a foreign embassy

39:40.681 --> 39:42.048
just to help you out.

39:42.116 --> 39:43.851
It's an amazing thing.

39:43.918 --> 39:45.552
Speaking of which,
here's your passport.

39:45.620 --> 39:48.890
And I texted your sister
on your cell phone number

39:48.957 --> 39:50.992
so she wouldn't be worried.

39:51.060 --> 39:52.660
Thanks.

39:52.728 --> 39:54.429
No problem.

39:54.496 --> 39:58.132
Glad you're back.

39:58.199 --> 40:00.434
You weren't worried
about me, were you, Auggie?

40:00.502 --> 40:03.337
Not for a second.

40:05.874 --> 40:08.075
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:08.143 --> 40:10.210
Jai said you basically
gave him directions

40:10.278 --> 40:11.711
where to find me.

40:11.779 --> 40:13.080
How did you know
I'd go to the Ukraine

40:13.147 --> 40:14.748
instead of back to Poland?

40:14.816 --> 40:18.285
Because it's unexpected.

40:18.353 --> 40:21.288
You always do
the unexpected thing.
