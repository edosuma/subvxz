WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:03.421
ELIZABETH: We were at
Minister Javani's house

00:03.422 --> 00:04.356
when it happened.

00:04.357 --> 00:07.519
Several members of my
security detail were wounded

00:07.520 --> 00:08.553
or killed.

00:08.554 --> 00:11.056
Minister Javani's son

00:11.057 --> 00:12.457
witnessed his father's death.

00:12.458 --> 00:14.693
As a mother, I would've given anything

00:14.693 --> 00:19.231
to protect that child, which is
why I am determined as ever

00:19.232 --> 00:21.333
to see through the nuclear agreement

00:21.334 --> 00:23.301
that his father gave his life for,

00:23.302 --> 00:25.871
because I think that's
our greatest responsibility

00:25.872 --> 00:28.974
in this life, to leave a safer
and more peaceful world...

00:28.975 --> 00:30.609
How was your night?

00:30.610 --> 00:32.644
Pillow between the knees

00:32.645 --> 00:35.047
is officially not working anymore.

00:35.048 --> 00:36.415
Really cramming to the last minute

00:36.416 --> 00:37.783
on this one.

00:37.784 --> 00:41.186
Yeah, I thought I had
my plan of attack.

00:41.187 --> 00:43.689
Then Mark starts giving me
these guidelines last night.

00:43.690 --> 00:46.058
Don't ask too much

00:46.059 --> 00:48.026
about that illegal arms
dealer she worked with.

00:48.027 --> 00:49.728
Don't go too hard on the Taliban deal.

00:49.729 --> 00:55.067
So? They can't dictate what
you're allowed to ask.

00:55.068 --> 00:57.602
No, but the secretary
can refuse to answer,

00:57.603 --> 01:00.772
which means my whole
warts-and-all inside look

01:00.773 --> 01:03.508
at the State Department is now
an airbrushed campaign poster

01:03.509 --> 01:06.110
for a White House run.

01:07.846 --> 01:10.414
Is this about your book deal?

01:13.418 --> 01:16.688
Can't sell a book proposal,

01:16.689 --> 01:20.025
giving up on war coverage...

01:20.026 --> 01:22.427
you know, maybe that's
why they put me on this.

01:22.428 --> 01:23.729
Figure I'll play ball.

01:23.730 --> 01:28.766
Then that just means they
won't see you coming.

01:34.706 --> 01:38.442
Once more unto the breach.

01:40.779 --> 01:43.914
Give 'em hell.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.391 --> 01:56.427
Hey. Uh, Neal Shin.

01:59.397 --> 02:01.833
I'm sorry. I don't have
you in the system.

02:01.834 --> 02:03.502
Uh, it's Neal with an "A."

02:03.503 --> 02:05.704
I was told there'd be a press pass.

02:05.705 --> 02:07.305
Who's your contact?

02:07.306 --> 02:09.207
Uh...

02:09.208 --> 02:11.243
Hey, you know what,
she can vouch for me.

02:11.244 --> 02:14.079
- Jessie. Neal.
- MAN: Yeah, we'll talk later, okay?

02:14.080 --> 02:15.514
- Oh, okay.
- Jessie.

02:15.515 --> 02:18.048
- Uh, another thing...
- Hey, guys.

02:19.751 --> 02:21.419
DAISY: Neal Shin?

02:21.420 --> 02:22.587
Daisy Grant.

02:22.588 --> 02:23.955
Oh, hey. Uh, they don't have my pass.

02:23.956 --> 02:27.192
He's with us today.

02:27.193 --> 02:29.026
Thank you.

02:31.096 --> 02:32.631
Glad you showed up.

02:32.632 --> 02:34.566
I was about to ask her to Google me.

02:34.567 --> 02:36.368
DAISY: <i>You know why those
other reporters let you hang?</i>

02:36.369 --> 02:38.336
Because they've been
following Secretary McCord

02:38.337 --> 02:39.538
for almost four years,

02:39.539 --> 02:41.940
sleeping on embassy floors in Togo,

02:41.941 --> 02:43.508
sweating in the back
of a stuffy plane,

02:43.509 --> 02:44.509
waiting for three words

02:44.510 --> 02:46.044
from one of the world's busiest women

02:46.045 --> 02:48.914
and you come waltzing in with
your 48 hours of nonstop access

02:48.915 --> 02:50.081
you didn't even ask for.

02:50.082 --> 02:51.416
My editor assigned me.

02:51.417 --> 02:52.951
Why, I can't imagine.

02:52.952 --> 02:54.853
- You definitely weren't my pick.
- Really?

02:54.854 --> 02:57.689
I wanted the guy who does the
Kennedy pieces in <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

02:57.690 --> 02:59.090
Elegant. Literary.

02:59.091 --> 03:02.260
Look, I'm not coming in with
any kind of agenda, okay?

03:02.261 --> 03:03.395
I just report what I see.

03:03.396 --> 03:05.530
All SCIFs and SVTC rooms
are completely off-limits.

03:05.531 --> 03:06.965
Neal.

03:06.966 --> 03:08.600
Welcome to the State Department.

03:08.601 --> 03:10.068
- Secretary McCord.
- I see you've met Daisy.

03:10.069 --> 03:11.870
Just giving him the rundown, ma'am.

03:11.871 --> 03:13.638
All right, well, we're glad
to have you here and...

03:13.639 --> 03:14.639
I need your phone.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.940
Oh.

03:18.643 --> 03:20.444
She's just doing her job.

03:21.446 --> 03:23.281
You can ask me anything
and if the answer

03:23.282 --> 03:25.450
is classified, Daisy will tackle you.

03:25.451 --> 03:28.320
I'm kidding. She just had a baby.

03:28.321 --> 03:30.188
Hey, I'm, uh, about to be
a father myself... twins.

03:30.189 --> 03:31.957
- Oh.
- I'll get your press pass.

03:31.958 --> 03:34.459
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.261
- Thank you.
- Uh, well, let's get in there.

03:36.262 --> 03:39.898
Guess I did a cannonball
in her press pool.

03:39.899 --> 03:42.300
Well, the press part...

03:42.301 --> 03:43.902
Oh, sorry. This way.

03:43.903 --> 03:45.770
Press pool are great reporters,

03:45.771 --> 03:48.039
but they want to keep their jobs.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.709
I'm glad that we went
with someone independent.

03:50.710 --> 03:52.577
It's good to pull back the curtain

03:52.578 --> 03:54.579
on what we do around here.

03:54.580 --> 03:57.816
And I really liked your
work in Afghanistan.

03:57.817 --> 03:59.618
- A lot.
- Thanks.

03:59.619 --> 04:00.819
Good morning, ma'am.

04:00.820 --> 04:03.054
Your remarks for the, uh,
Worldwide Partnership

04:03.055 --> 04:04.990
for Girls' and Women's
Education Conference.

04:04.991 --> 04:06.992
But the student essay
contest winners, that's...

04:06.993 --> 04:08.560
- tomorrow, you're gonna be...
- "What America Means to Me"

04:08.561 --> 04:09.728
I'm working on it. Oh.

04:09.729 --> 04:10.762
Hey. Matt Mahoney.

04:10.763 --> 04:12.864
I'm sorry. Matt Mahoney. Neal Shin.

04:12.865 --> 04:14.699
Head speech writer. Nice to
meet you. You do good work.

04:14.700 --> 04:15.934
Oh, thank you.

04:15.935 --> 04:17.435
I liked your book on Syria.

04:17.435 --> 04:20.238
Though "like" is probably
not the correct word.

04:20.238 --> 04:21.839
Well, we try to be more optimistic

04:21.841 --> 04:24.342
about the outcomes around here.

04:24.343 --> 04:26.912
So, you don't find your faith
in humanity sometimes shaken

04:26.913 --> 04:28.947
by the work you do here?

04:28.948 --> 04:30.849
You like to come out
swinging, don't you, Neal?

04:30.850 --> 04:33.818
- Come on in.
- MATT: I mean, it's not even noon yet.

04:33.819 --> 04:36.755
Everyone, please introduce
yourself to Neal Shin

04:36.756 --> 04:39.324
from <i>The Washington Chronicle.</i>
Can take a seat right here.

04:39.325 --> 04:40.469
He's gonna be shadowing us

04:40.470 --> 04:41.738
- the next couple of days.
- Kat Sandoval, policy advisor.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.005
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

04:43.006 --> 04:44.173
Hey, Neal. Jay Whitman.

04:44.174 --> 04:46.008
I liked your coverage on Afghanistan.

04:46.009 --> 04:48.044
Thanks. Uh, I saw you
did some time there.

04:48.045 --> 04:50.046
Yeah. Looks like we both made it out.

04:50.047 --> 04:51.714
- (CHUCKLES)
- Welcome.

04:51.715 --> 04:54.621
As mentioned in the memo,
Mr. Shin has full access

04:54.622 --> 04:56.356
for a cover profile on the secretary,

04:56.357 --> 04:58.358
but please be mindful of
classified information

04:58.359 --> 04:59.459
and activities.

04:59.460 --> 05:00.526
DAISY: If you aren't
sure about anything,

05:00.527 --> 05:02.762
check with me, please.

05:02.763 --> 05:04.264
NEAL: Thanks, everyone.
Just, you know,

05:04.265 --> 05:06.099
- pretend like I'm not here.
- KAT: Yeah, right.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.301
I'm Blake Moran,
assistant to the secretary

05:08.302 --> 05:10.403
and the best snacks
are one flight down.

05:10.404 --> 05:11.571
I hope that's not classified.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.973
JAY: Here we go.
The Worldwide Partnership

05:13.974 --> 05:15.708
for Girls' and Women's
Education Conference

05:15.709 --> 05:17.143
begins at 11:00 a.m. today

05:17.144 --> 05:19.345
with the secretary's remarks
scheduled for 11:30.

05:19.346 --> 05:21.247
I'm told that the food will
be excellent this year,

05:21.248 --> 05:23.383
so you will want to arrive
early for the passed apps.

05:23.384 --> 05:25.518
I've arranged for a platter
for you in the green room.

05:25.519 --> 05:26.953
I'm sure that's not necessary. Yeah.

05:26.954 --> 05:28.554
- You have all the appetizers you want.
- Don't need a platter.

05:28.555 --> 05:30.724
On a more urgent note,
there's a developing situation

05:30.725 --> 05:32.693
on the U.S.-Mexico border

05:32.694 --> 05:34.868
just south of Laredo, Texas.

05:34.869 --> 05:36.670
A recent flood of
refugees from Honduras

05:36.671 --> 05:39.273
has overwhelmed Mexican
detention facilities

05:39.274 --> 05:40.607
and there's a disturbing number

05:40.608 --> 05:43.544
of unaccompanied minors
showing up, some kids

05:43.545 --> 05:44.678
as young as ten.

05:44.679 --> 05:46.747
We're barely three weeks
into Fonseca's first term

05:46.748 --> 05:48.882
and already Honduras is in shambles.

05:48.883 --> 05:50.951
ELIZABETH: Well, after campaigning

05:50.952 --> 05:54.355
on law and order,
FT-88 is pretty much running

05:54.356 --> 05:55.389
the National Police.

05:55.390 --> 05:57.391
So now desperate families, of course,

05:57.392 --> 05:59.393
are sending their kids up north alone

05:59.394 --> 06:00.694
to keep them from being recruited.

06:00.695 --> 06:02.229
JAY: President Zaragoza of Mexico

06:02.230 --> 06:05.833
is requesting an increase in aid
to help with the added burden

06:05.834 --> 06:07.034
on their detention facilities.

06:07.035 --> 06:08.469
KAT: Ooh. I've read reports

06:08.470 --> 06:10.404
on those facilities.
They're horrendous

06:10.405 --> 06:11.805
when they're not overcrowded.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.807
JAY: He's also requesting U.S.
asylum for the Honduran minors.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.943
Why?

06:15.944 --> 06:18.812
Those aren't the terms of
our deal and he knows it.

06:18.813 --> 06:21.015
- Somebody's putting pressure on him.
- Honduras maybe?

06:21.016 --> 06:22.716
I think the pressure's
coming from the kids.

06:22.717 --> 06:24.651
This was posted yesterday
from the detention center

06:24.652 --> 06:25.686
in Nuevo Laredo.

06:25.687 --> 06:27.787
(CHILDREN SINGING IN SPANISH)

06:31.992 --> 06:34.561
They're saying they're staging
their funerals to the world

06:34.562 --> 06:37.697
before Mexico sends them
back to be killed by FT-88.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.739
(QUIETLY): God.

06:45.740 --> 06:47.608
Brilliant use of social media.

06:47.609 --> 06:48.809
It's gotten over a million hits.

06:48.810 --> 06:52.413
Let's call President Zaragoza.

06:52.414 --> 06:53.814
Neal, you care to join?

06:53.815 --> 06:55.448
Off the record.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.620
FT-88 has complete
control of Honduras.

06:59.621 --> 07:01.255
The country's falling apart.

07:01.256 --> 07:04.024
And that is a crisis we will address.

07:04.025 --> 07:07.394
Yes, with conferences and sanctions

07:07.395 --> 07:10.731
and what is your word, inducements.

07:10.732 --> 07:13.300
But until the country stabilizes,

07:13.301 --> 07:15.903
you must find a place for these kids.

07:15.904 --> 07:17.371
We can't take them all.

07:17.372 --> 07:19.139
You know the terms of
our agreement, Mario.

07:19.140 --> 07:22.776
We can't change our
immigration policy.

07:22.777 --> 07:24.478
ZARAGOZA: Things have changed

07:24.479 --> 07:25.779
since we set those terms.

07:25.780 --> 07:29.049
Elizabeth, this is a crisis.

07:29.050 --> 07:31.051
I am begging you.

07:31.052 --> 07:36.223
According to the agreement,
you have 72 hours

07:36.224 --> 07:38.725
before the migrants have to
be returned to Honduras.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.494
Now, I am not making any promises,

07:40.495 --> 07:43.630
but I'll talk to our embassy in Mexico

07:43.631 --> 07:47.401
about getting them humanitarian
parole through USCIS.

07:47.402 --> 07:50.104
I thank you, Madam Secretary.

07:50.105 --> 07:51.805
Ma'am, I am sorry,

07:51.806 --> 07:53.173
but Congress is on the floor right now

07:53.174 --> 07:55.075
debating Dalton's Comprehensive
Immigration Reform bill.

07:55.076 --> 07:56.743
Is this the time to try to bring in

07:56.744 --> 07:58.846
a group of kids fleeing gang
violence in Central America?

07:58.847 --> 08:00.080
I think I made it clear

08:00.081 --> 08:01.582
that it was a long shot.

08:01.583 --> 08:03.317
No, I'm not just concerned
about the kids.

08:03.318 --> 08:04.618
If Congressional hardliners get wind

08:04.619 --> 08:06.520
of this humanitarian parole,
it'll be just the excuse

08:06.521 --> 08:07.955
they've been looking
for to pull the plug.

08:07.956 --> 08:09.723
All it takes is one bad press story.

08:09.724 --> 08:11.225
I am really starting to
wonder about you being here.

08:11.226 --> 08:12.826
No, we said that it was off the record.

08:12.827 --> 08:13.855
- Well, he's taking notes.
- I'm sorry.

08:13.856 --> 08:15.162
It's time for the Education Conference.

08:15.163 --> 08:17.865
It's just notes for myself.

08:17.866 --> 08:21.702
Look, the Senate is voting
on the CIR in two days.

08:21.703 --> 08:24.071
Just have to keep it quiet until then.

08:24.072 --> 08:25.506
Sure, we just need to

08:25.507 --> 08:27.274
transport the kids to a
resettlement support center,

08:27.275 --> 08:29.176
process them through USCIS

08:29.177 --> 08:31.845
and grant them at least
temporary asylum

08:31.846 --> 08:33.447
without anyone noticing.
What could go wrong?

08:33.448 --> 08:35.313
(SIGHS)

08:41.922 --> 08:43.256
MATT: <i>Hey, I wanted to run</i>

08:43.258 --> 08:45.559
a book idea by you. <i>Backseat Driver.</i>

08:45.560 --> 08:48.295
A, uh, behind-the-scenes
look at how speech writers

08:48.296 --> 08:51.098
have helped drive policy
through U.S. history.

08:51.099 --> 08:52.866
You know your boss is
sitting right there?

08:52.867 --> 08:54.801
Well, of course I'd honor
your contribution, ma'am.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.003
Aw, that's sweet.

08:56.004 --> 08:57.171
So, what do you think?

08:57.172 --> 08:58.872
- Yeah, you could probably sell that.
- Nice.

08:58.873 --> 09:01.341
I mean, as long as a
publisher thinks it'll knock

09:01.342 --> 09:03.544
some pregnant celebrity off
the top ten trending topics

09:03.545 --> 09:04.511
on social media.

09:04.512 --> 09:07.347
'Cause 280 characters seems to be

09:07.348 --> 09:09.283

But at least you'll be
making your contribution

09:10.952 --> 09:13.320
to the future museum of
American journalism,

09:13.321 --> 09:15.656
right up there with the spinning
jenny and the phonograph.

He might be more bitter than you are.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.426
ELIZABETH: Hey, what happened
to the lines we had in here

09:19.427 --> 09:23.597
about the Gulf states holding
half their population

09:23.598 --> 09:25.432
- in a cultural prison?
- White House killed that, ma'am.

09:25.433 --> 09:27.134
Why?

09:27.135 --> 09:29.703
Something about not alienating
key allies in the Middle East,

09:29.704 --> 09:31.772
- I'm guessing.
- Well, put it back in there.

09:31.773 --> 09:33.373
I'll take the heat
from Russell Jackson.

09:33.374 --> 09:36.076
- Yes, ma'am.
- (SIGHS)

09:36.077 --> 09:37.511
There are women at this conference

09:37.512 --> 09:41.348
who have risked their lives
fighting for gender equality.

09:41.349 --> 09:42.916
I noticed Amina Salah.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.651
Did you know Amina

09:44.652 --> 09:46.720
when she was education
minister in Afghanistan?

09:46.721 --> 09:49.189
No, but I was aware of her work.

09:49.190 --> 09:50.991
That was a real loss when
she had to step down.

09:50.992 --> 09:51.992
Yes, it was.

09:51.993 --> 09:53.093
Couldn't be helped, unfortunately.

09:53.094 --> 09:54.161
JAY: And that deal with the Taliban

09:54.162 --> 09:56.563
might've actually
stabilized Afghanistan

09:56.564 --> 09:58.665
for the first time in decades.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.033
Well, she could regain her position

10:00.034 --> 10:02.135
once the dust settles.

10:02.136 --> 10:04.838
They're trying to tell you that
I have no reason to feel guilty

10:04.839 --> 10:06.707
about making a deal that took women

10:06.708 --> 10:09.409
out of government positions.

10:09.410 --> 10:13.547
But I do have reason and I am guilty.

10:13.548 --> 10:15.549
Maybe it's the Taliban who
should feel guilty, ma'am.

10:15.550 --> 10:17.751
(CHUCKLES) Good luck with that.

10:17.752 --> 10:19.819
So what else do you feel guilty about?

10:21.555 --> 10:26.493
Anything I could've done better
if I'd thought about it longer.

10:26.494 --> 10:30.364
So the deal with the Taliban.

10:30.365 --> 10:32.165
Should you have thought
about it longer?

10:32.166 --> 10:33.500
We got Intel that the Taliban's

10:33.501 --> 10:38.205
positions have evolved since
you and I covered Afghanistan.

10:38.206 --> 10:39.773
You believe that?

10:39.774 --> 10:43.610
The story's not written
on that decision yet.

10:43.611 --> 10:48.382
I may live to regret it.

10:48.383 --> 10:52.085
A lot of this work is
making impossible choices.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.186
Yes, but...

10:53.187 --> 10:55.389
Gosh, look, we're already here.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

How are you?

11:08.970 --> 11:10.470

to hear your speech.

11:10.471 --> 11:15.275
Yes, another speaking engagement.

11:15.276 --> 11:17.344
If only I felt it would
change anything,

11:17.345 --> 11:19.546
but then I guess we have
to congratulate ourselves

11:19.547 --> 11:21.548
when we can. Excuse me.

I'm Neal Shin. I
reported in Afghanistan

11:29.557 --> 11:32.259
during your tenure as
education minister.

11:32.260 --> 11:33.427
Yes, yes, I remember.

11:33.428 --> 11:35.227
I'm sorry you had to step down.

11:37.731 --> 11:38.865
I'd like to talk to you about

11:38.866 --> 11:40.367
some of the changes in your country.

11:40.368 --> 11:42.569
Maybe we could sit down together?

11:42.570 --> 11:44.004
Yes. After I speak?

11:44.005 --> 11:48.407
Uh... Maybe we could
meet somewhere later?

11:53.947 --> 11:55.349
ELIZABETH: <i>We left off</i>

11:55.350 --> 11:59.186

11:59.187 --> 12:01.421
what are yours?

12:01.422 --> 12:04.624
Uh... you mean in my work?

12:04.625 --> 12:07.427
No, who you didn't take to the prom.

12:07.428 --> 12:08.928
Yeah, in your work.

12:11.598 --> 12:14.835
I was in Greece when the
migrants started pouring in.

12:14.836 --> 12:16.870
I gave up trying to report

12:16.871 --> 12:19.406
and just started
grabbing kids off boats.

12:19.407 --> 12:21.541
A lot of them died before
we could get help.

12:21.542 --> 12:22.776
That's one of many.

12:22.777 --> 12:24.644
(SIGHS): Well,

12:24.645 --> 12:28.515
it's not easy confronting
human misery.

12:28.516 --> 12:30.851
You try to help, but a lot of times,

12:30.852 --> 12:34.454
it feels like you're just...

12:34.455 --> 12:37.224
grabbing babies off of sinking boats.

12:37.225 --> 12:40.494
But I have to believe that I'm

12:40.495 --> 12:43.363
preventing worse,

12:43.364 --> 12:47.167
just like you have to know you
did what you could that day,

12:47.168 --> 12:50.069
even though it wasn't nearly enough.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.673
Sorry to interrupt.

12:53.674 --> 12:55.008
We just got word that Senator Morejon

12:55.009 --> 12:57.611
is withdrawing his support
from the immigration bill.

12:57.612 --> 13:00.046
Damn it. What happened?

13:00.047 --> 13:01.615
Someone tipped him to the
humanitarian parole request

13:01.616 --> 13:03.717
and now he is accusing Dalton
of negotiating in bad faith.

13:03.718 --> 13:07.354
By bringing in Honduran
kids fleeing violence?

13:07.355 --> 13:11.258
He's saying we're trying to
slip it in under the radar.

13:11.259 --> 13:12.959
Well, that's exactly
what we were doing.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.095
He's just looking for
an excuse to pull out.

13:15.096 --> 13:16.630
And take his whole caucus with him.

13:16.631 --> 13:18.432
You called it.

find out what he wants.

14:02.671 --> 14:04.873
I had a really crazy day at work,

14:04.874 --> 14:07.041
and I just totally spaced.

14:07.042 --> 14:09.043
Neal, can I offer you a glass of wine?

14:09.044 --> 14:10.912
Are you allowed to
when you're on duty?

14:10.913 --> 14:12.947
- No, thanks, I'm good.
- I'll have some.

14:12.948 --> 14:16.551
So, uh... what's
happening with Morejon?

14:16.552 --> 14:19.721
Or, unless... we can
talk about this later.

14:19.722 --> 14:20.889
Oh.

14:20.890 --> 14:22.724
It's fine, we're off
the record on Morejon.

14:22.725 --> 14:26.995
Oh. So that works?

14:26.996 --> 14:28.396
You just say "off the record,"

14:28.397 --> 14:30.531
and you don't publish
anything that we say?

14:30.532 --> 14:32.967
No, not if I want anybody to trust me.

14:32.968 --> 14:35.036
It's one of the last
great oral contracts.

14:35.037 --> 14:37.105
So let's hear it.

14:37.106 --> 14:38.940
Was Russell screaming about it?

14:38.941 --> 14:40.141
What do you think?

14:40.142 --> 14:43.912
(SIGHS) I think...

14:43.913 --> 14:46.981
I want to try and not
think about it right now.

14:46.982 --> 14:48.216
That sounds really nice.

14:48.217 --> 14:50.919
You guys have a nice chat.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.654
So you're working in the White House.

14:52.655 --> 14:53.821
How's that?

14:53.822 --> 14:57.692
Ah, yes, it's, uh, it's
not really a <i>job</i> job,

14:57.693 --> 14:59.460
um, it's just an internship

14:59.461 --> 15:00.862
until I start law school.

15:00.863 --> 15:03.331
Oh, cool. You know what kind
of law you want to go into?

15:03.332 --> 15:06.401
Not yet, um...

15:06.402 --> 15:08.219

I'm still going. (CHUCKLES)

- We're still off the record, right?
- Don't worry.

15:12.074 --> 15:15.310
Yeah, it's never a straight line.

15:15.311 --> 15:17.111
I started out working on
my dad's fishing boat.

15:17.112 --> 15:19.614
Wow, so how did you
get into reporting?

15:19.615 --> 15:20.682
Uh, the usual.

15:20.683 --> 15:22.417
Wanted a girl to think I was cool.

15:22.418 --> 15:24.585
(LAUGHS) Did it work?

15:24.586 --> 15:25.954
No. (LAUGHS)

15:25.955 --> 15:27.622
But I married someone cooler.

15:27.623 --> 15:29.257
Mm.

15:29.258 --> 15:30.792
You dropped out of undergrad
for a time, right?

15:30.793 --> 15:33.361
Yeah, um, right in the beginning

15:33.362 --> 15:35.763
when my mom first became secretary.

15:35.764 --> 15:38.499
It was kind of difficult, like...

15:38.500 --> 15:41.302
being in the public eye and...

15:41.303 --> 15:43.271
But it's had its advantages, too?

15:43.272 --> 15:44.939
Now you work in the White House.

15:44.940 --> 15:49.609
Oh, yeah, I didn't get this
job because of my mom.

15:51.679 --> 15:53.948
Um, yeah, I was, I was actually

15:53.949 --> 15:56.985
asking Russell for a-a
recommendation for law school.

15:56.986 --> 15:59.253
Well, he-he offered me
the job... internship.

15:59.254 --> 16:01.656
Hey, you must be Neal. Henry McCord.

16:01.657 --> 16:03.925
- Please call me Henry.
- It's nice to meet you, Henry.

16:03.926 --> 16:06.894
Neal was just asking
me about nepotism.

16:06.895 --> 16:08.129
Oh.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.698
I was just interested in the
ways your mom's position

16:10.699 --> 16:11.966
has affected your life.

16:11.967 --> 16:14.002
Yeah, it's just, it's just
an internship, you know.

16:14.003 --> 16:15.937
And, um...

16:15.938 --> 16:18.873
I'm sure that a lot of
people did apply for them,

16:18.874 --> 16:21.709
but I happened to be
the one who was there

16:21.710 --> 16:24.045
and called for help when Russell
was having a heart attack.

16:24.046 --> 16:27.682
And now I have the job, and I'm
actually more of a liability

16:27.683 --> 16:31.485
than an asset because of
my mom's position, so...

16:35.156 --> 16:40.327
I'm gonna finish setting the... table.

17:13.595 --> 17:15.930
Do you ever think that sometimes

17:15.931 --> 17:19.099
you find dishonesty and hypocrisy

17:19.101 --> 17:21.234
because you've already
decided it's there?

17:21.236 --> 17:22.703
Well, I prefer to think of my work

17:22.704 --> 17:24.739

17:24.740 --> 17:27.208
Well, then, as a Catholic,

17:27.209 --> 17:29.710
I would have to say we're
both searching for something

18:33.609 --> 18:35.109
after everything you'd been through,

18:35.110 --> 18:36.876
how'd you feel?

18:37.645 --> 18:39.480
I would say I was struck

18:39.481 --> 18:42.183
by the great irony of life.

18:42.184 --> 18:44.985
Not betrayed? Not enraged?

18:46.721 --> 18:49.590
To be betrayed,
one has to believe in loyalty.

18:49.591 --> 18:53.059
That's a luxury I don't
allow myself anymore.

18:54.695 --> 18:56.697
Not giving you the quote
you're looking for, am I?

18:56.698 --> 19:00.635
I'm just trying to get a
multitude of perspectives

19:00.636 --> 19:03.204
on the secretary's policies.
I don't have an agenda.

19:03.205 --> 19:05.540
(CHUCKLES)

19:05.541 --> 19:08.008
Everyone has an agenda.

19:11.746 --> 19:14.482
Here's what I would never say to her

19:14.483 --> 19:16.150
or to anyone in my country,

19:16.151 --> 19:18.418
so don't quote me.

19:21.789 --> 19:25.493
Maybe it was for the best.

19:25.494 --> 19:28.529
Afghanistan has been exhausted
to the brink of ruin

19:28.530 --> 19:30.364
by decades of war.

19:30.365 --> 19:32.166
I don't have to tell you that.

19:32.167 --> 19:34.702
The first step to changing anything

19:34.703 --> 19:36.470
is to end the conflict.

19:36.471 --> 19:39.006
If giving the Taliban
a seat at the table

19:39.007 --> 19:40.741
and trusting that they
can be more moderate

19:40.742 --> 19:42.677
is the first step to
ending the occupation

19:42.678 --> 19:45.913
of the United States and
rebuilding our country...

19:45.914 --> 19:48.583
I hesitate to say it,

19:48.584 --> 19:50.850
but maybe it was worth it.

19:55.990 --> 19:58.059
It can't be that bad,

19:58.060 --> 20:00.527
writing a positive profile?

20:03.231 --> 20:06.267
You can't make a drawing
without shadows.

20:06.268 --> 20:08.368
Not a good one.

20:11.472 --> 20:12.939

20:22.416 --> 20:25.086
Excuse me, Mr. Shin?

20:25.087 --> 20:27.989

20:27.990 --> 20:29.857
Do you have a moment?

20:29.858 --> 20:32.026
- What's this about?
- I don't know if you're familiar

20:32.027 --> 20:33.194
with our work.

20:33.195 --> 20:34.996
We're a subsidiary of Trenton Press.

20:34.997 --> 20:36.397
I'm familiar.

20:36.398 --> 20:38.231
I'd like to discuss an opportunity.

20:38.966 --> 20:41.302
Why don't you call my agent.

20:41.303 --> 20:43.504
Well, I'll leave this with you, then.

20:43.505 --> 20:45.773
We are fans of your work.

20:45.774 --> 20:47.174
Well, it's not exactly the
feverish conspiracy crap

20:47.175 --> 20:48.242
you guys like to dish out.

20:48.243 --> 20:51.112
Well, we're not afraid
of straight talk

20:51.113 --> 20:52.680

20:52.681 --> 20:56.017
We are looking to expand
across the political spectrum.

20:56.018 --> 20:57.852
You'd be an important part of that.

20:57.853 --> 21:00.621
I loved your book proposal,
by the way.

21:00.622 --> 21:02.857
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Well, that makes two of us.

21:02.858 --> 21:06.627
This is an offer to expand your
article on Secretary McCord

21:06.628 --> 21:08.629
into a book.

21:08.630 --> 21:10.598
It'd be on the fast track
for fall publication

21:10.599 --> 21:13.901
with full marketing and promotion.

21:13.902 --> 21:16.871
The advance is $200,000.

21:16.872 --> 21:19.340
I don't jump on command. Sorry.

21:19.341 --> 21:21.442
We'd have no editorial requirements.

21:21.443 --> 21:23.611
That's all in the contract,

21:23.612 --> 21:25.513
along with some additional information

21:25.514 --> 21:27.682
we've gathered on the secretary.

21:27.683 --> 21:29.917
Purely for your consideration.

21:29.918 --> 21:32.051
Not interested.

21:32.953 --> 21:35.289
Don't you think the
American public deserves

21:35.290 --> 21:36.657
to know the truth?

(SCOFFS)

21:38.160 --> 21:40.061

21:40.062 --> 21:42.061
it might help you with your article.

21:50.471 --> 21:52.739
I'll talk to you soon.

22:06.028 --> 22:08.283
There's no editorial mandate.

22:08.284 --> 22:09.651
It's a straightforward deal.

22:09.652 --> 22:11.553
Doesn't mean they won't edit
me into some crazy hit job.

22:11.554 --> 22:15.056
Yeah, especially at a
place like Hidebound.

22:15.057 --> 22:16.291
Why you, though?

22:16.292 --> 22:18.277
I mean, it's not like
they need your article

22:18.278 --> 22:19.411
to build their book on.

22:19.412 --> 22:22.581
Some BS about expanding their brand.

22:22.582 --> 22:25.084
It looks more legit when
their conspiracy nonsense

22:25.085 --> 22:27.185
comes from a reporter with cred.

22:29.421 --> 22:30.389
You think they have

22:30.390 --> 22:32.458
anything real?

22:32.459 --> 22:35.461
I'm sure she's crossed some
lines, they always do.

22:35.462 --> 22:37.893
Plus, she was CIA.

I don't know.

22:50.477 --> 22:53.212
Oh. The fridge crapped out again.

22:53.213 --> 22:55.951
I didn't want the ice to melt
on the floor like last time.

22:55.952 --> 22:59.351
I thought the guy put the thing in.

22:59.352 --> 23:01.754
Apparently, it was a different thing.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.155
I left him a message.

23:03.156 --> 23:05.224
He better not charge us again.

23:05.225 --> 23:08.026
I'm gonna go to bed.

23:10.763 --> 23:13.232
My advice?

23:13.233 --> 23:14.833
Don't open it.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.995
The senator isn't available

29:40.909 --> 29:43.578
that we didn't have time
to request an invitation.

29:43.579 --> 29:46.914
I guess I figured, as the
CEO of a private prison,

29:46.915 --> 29:48.749
you'd understand the
private and the public

29:48.750 --> 29:49.917

my assistant Blake Moran,

29:55.691 --> 29:58.159

29:58.160 --> 30:00.761
You can't bring press in here.

This is strictly off the record.

But the fact

30:06.101 --> 30:09.036
that you're a major donor to
Senator Morejon's campaign,

30:09.037 --> 30:12.306
well, that's public information.

30:12.307 --> 30:13.474
And I'm afraid

30:13.475 --> 30:15.109
Neal is also aware

30:15.110 --> 30:18.562
that Senator Morejon threatened
to derail legislation

30:18.563 --> 30:22.532
in Congress to try to put
pressure on the president

30:22.533 --> 30:26.203
to drop his executive order
divesting from private prisons.

30:26.204 --> 30:29.754
You have zero evidence
of those allegations.

30:29.755 --> 30:31.577
Let me just cut to the chase.

30:31.578 --> 30:34.980
He's not going to revoke
the executive order.

30:34.981 --> 30:37.249
And I know that you stand
to lose a lot of business

30:37.250 --> 30:39.385
once the federal government
pulls out its inmates.

30:39.386 --> 30:40.753
So, I mean, what is it?

30:40.754 --> 30:42.588
Blake, is it 80%?

30:42.589 --> 30:44.290
Oh, it's more like 85, ma'am.

30:44.291 --> 30:45.891
85, wow.

30:45.892 --> 30:47.560

30:51.031 --> 30:53.699
You've got four facilities in
South Texas due to be empty

30:53.700 --> 30:56.101

order goes through.

30:56.102 --> 30:58.571

31:21.061 --> 31:24.530
I'll need to regroup,

31:24.531 --> 31:26.765

- No.

How could you cut a

He lobbies for laws that
target and imprison low-income

his cronies can get richer.

32:17.517 --> 32:19.018
It's practically modern day slavery.

32:19.019 --> 32:21.320
And I just gave him the opportunity

32:21.321 --> 32:23.088
to change his business model.

32:23.089 --> 32:25.157
You saved him from going under.

All right? He pressured you
with a corrupt senator,

32:27.794 --> 32:30.396

40:01.329 --> 40:03.597
that is a story that needs to be told.

40:03.598 --> 40:05.332
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

40:05.333 --> 40:06.701
You bet.

40:06.702 --> 40:08.836
And, uh, when you open this,

40:08.837 --> 40:10.271
you might be going,

40:10.272 --> 40:12.273
"Really? A wet/dry vac."

40:12.274 --> 40:13.941
But trust me,

40:13.942 --> 40:15.109
one day you are gonna thank me.

40:15.110 --> 40:17.507
Good luck, Neal.

40:18.141 --> 40:19.908
Thank you for everything.

40:21.916 --> 40:23.484
Hey.

40:23.485 --> 40:26.487
You see that lady?

40:26.488 --> 40:29.290
(WHISPERS): She's gonna be
your president one day.

40:29.291 --> 40:31.125
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

40:31.126 --> 40:32.460
Hi.

40:32.461 --> 40:34.460
(BABY FUSSING QUIETLY)

40:37.487 --> 40:39.300
Mr. Shin, ma'am.

40:39.301 --> 40:40.868
Neal.

40:40.869 --> 40:43.537
Wet/dry vac not working out for you?

40:43.538 --> 40:45.639
(CHUCKLES): Uh, we haven't
quite gotten there yet.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.675
I'm just, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

40:47.676 --> 40:49.810
What can I do for you?

40:49.811 --> 40:51.412
Um, sorry to come by again.

40:51.413 --> 40:56.049
I, um... I wanted to bring
you something in person.

40:58.219 --> 40:59.954
A publisher approached me,

40:59.955 --> 41:02.123
asking me to write a book about you,

41:02.124 --> 41:04.125
exposing everything
that's on that drive.

41:04.126 --> 41:06.227
I don't know where they
got it, I don't know...

41:06.228 --> 41:08.078
how much of it's true,
but, you know some

41:08.079 --> 41:09.663
writer who's even hungrier than I am

41:09.664 --> 41:13.534
is gonna take that deal, and
you should know what's coming.

41:13.535 --> 41:15.235
Thank you.

41:16.270 --> 41:19.138
But you can keep it.

41:22.977 --> 41:26.046
I don't think you want me
to have this: the, uh...

41:26.047 --> 41:28.916
the enhanced interrogation
of Safeer Al-Jamil,

41:28.917 --> 41:31.252
- the death of Joseph Garcia...
- Oh.

41:31.253 --> 41:34.821
I have a pretty good idea
about what's on there.

41:36.657 --> 41:38.592
But I stand by my choices,

41:38.593 --> 41:42.061
and I'll explain them
to anyone who asks.

41:43.697 --> 41:46.020
Keep grabbing babies off
boats, then, I guess.

41:46.021 --> 41:48.508
(CHUCKLES) You, too.

41:50.071 --> 41:52.438
♪

42:11.025 --> 42:12.827
Will you do me a favor

42:12.828 --> 42:16.363
and... keep that somewhere safe?

42:16.364 --> 42:18.298
What is it?

42:20.401 --> 42:23.937
Tell her it's for when she's
ready to do battle with tyranny.
