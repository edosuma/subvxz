00:11.178 --> 00:12.680
Yo, Theo, they all ready for you, bro.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.683
Awesome, how do I look? Smart?

00:16.015 --> 00:17.768
Appreciate the honesty.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.479
- Do it, huh?
- Go get 'em.

00:20.562 --> 00:27.569

00:41.750 --> 00:44.545
New Orleans!

00:48.382 --> 00:51.510
Yes, indeed.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.388
How we doin', Crescent City?

00:54.471 --> 00:55.973
[Applause]

00:58.934 --> 01:02.021
Good to be home, baby.
Good to be home!

01:02.103 --> 01:06.608
My buddy said, "Dang, you going down
to New Orleans to shoot your special?"

01:06.692 --> 01:08.402
I said, "Yeah!"

01:08.485 --> 01:12.072
He said, "What about that crime?"
I said, "Yeah."

01:12.155 --> 01:14.825
He said, "You might get murdered."
I said, "Yeah."

01:16.076 --> 01:18.746
"But where else you want
to get murdered, baby?"

01:19.830 --> 01:22.123
I don't wanna get gunned down
in Cleveland.

01:22.207 --> 01:26.837
I don't wanna get gunned down in Seattle.
Murder me in New Orleans, baby!

01:26.921 --> 01:28.923
Right off the French Quarter,

01:29.048 --> 01:33.552
with a stripper on my arm
and a fried shrimp in my mouth!

01:36.304 --> 01:37.723
Good to be here, man.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.308
I love this city,
and it is dangerous as hell.

01:41.393 --> 01:45.439
Last time I was here,
I got bit by a black widow in March.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.441
She was in her 40s.

01:48.483 --> 01:51.152
At this bus stop, man.
Right off Canal, bro.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.363
Got me right in the neck, son.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.365
These bitches is accurate.

01:58.953 --> 02:02.330
Been a tough time, man.
Been a tough year... family stuff.

02:02.414 --> 02:03.749
You know, always, man.

02:03.832 --> 02:07.962
My uncle just got busted for, uh, uh...

02:08.044 --> 02:09.838
[inhales]

02:10.170 --> 02:12.382
sucking really small dicks.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.348
Yeah, they got him.

02:21.934 --> 02:27.272
He was my favorite uncle, man.
He taught us how to masturbate, actually.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.149
He didn't touch us
or anything like that.

02:29.232 --> 02:32.736
He just stood up and jerked off
into the fire at this party.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.325
I wasn't gonna say anything.
It was his party.

02:39.994 --> 02:43.204
Sometimes you just got to sit there
and be a Christian.

02:47.417 --> 02:51.088
But in his defense, my uncle's had
a lot of issues in his life.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.841
He used to masturbate in his sleep.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.802
So... I'm not joking, man.

02:56.885 --> 03:00.472
So they made him wear these
jingle bells on his wrists.

03:03.767 --> 03:07.896
But some nights
you would hear him in the other room,

03:07.980 --> 03:09.940
dashing through the snow.

03:11.733 --> 03:15.112
You know what I'm saying,
jerking his own dick off.

03:16.655 --> 03:20.367
I'd make requests.
"Play 'Rudolph' Uncle Danny!"

03:20.450 --> 03:23.286
"Y'all go to bed!"

03:23.370 --> 03:27.041
You telling me this musical masturbator
doesn't take requests?

03:28.083 --> 03:30.544
What kinda family is this, bro?

03:30.627 --> 03:33.547
This family tree
got haters in the branches.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.596
Lot of child molesters out there?

03:41.680 --> 03:43.515
No offense if you're in the game.

03:45.433 --> 03:49.521
And now, it's like a big deal, I feel
like, if you get molested, you know.

03:49.604 --> 03:53.650
There's Child Services, it gets
on the news, it gets on the Internet.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.486
Like, when I was young,
you just got molested.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.657
Remember that, bro?
Remember the '80s, dude?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.744
You just got molested!

04:04.745 --> 04:07.581
You got a milkshake and a ride somewhere.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.500
That was your end of the deal.

04:12.377 --> 04:16.214
When I was young, if you got molested,
you just got back on your bike

04:16.297 --> 04:20.177
and said, "Well, we ain't
coming around here anymore.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.097
Nothing but dick around here."

04:25.724 --> 04:30.812
Look, if I got a dollar for every time
I got molested...

04:30.896 --> 04:35.483
I'd have like,
four dollars and 50 cents.

04:35.567 --> 04:39.113
'Cause I got in this oral
pyramid scheme by the Denny's.

04:44.952 --> 04:48.663
Parents, you gotta be careful
when it comes to these kiddy-touchers.

04:48.747 --> 04:52.375
You gotta be careful when it comes
to these kiddy-touchers.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.421
You can't be getting your son
all fixed up.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.757
You can't be getting your boys lisp fixed.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.385
Get his acne tightened up.
Get the pro-action on him.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.304
Get his limp fixed.

05:05.973 --> 05:10.144
And then be shocked when he gets
picked by the kiddy-touchers!

05:10.227 --> 05:12.854
Fuck, you got him all G'd out.

05:14.106 --> 05:20.695
You know who ain't getting picked,
is little Ch-Ch-Charlie's ass, okay?

05:20.779 --> 05:23.364
Who still got his lisp,
who got his acne,

05:23.448 --> 05:27.661
who got a wrap his bad leg around his
good leg when he wanna go somewheres.

05:27.744 --> 05:31.414
Nobody touchin'
little Ch-Ch-Charlie's ass.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.335
You gotta think like the enemy.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.049
Save your money, give it to your boy
in a lump sum when he's 18.

05:41.133 --> 05:45.262
Let himself G'd out
when he's out of the danger zone.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.974
Think about life.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.482
Good to be home, man, I was born
about eight blocks from here, bro.

05:57.565 --> 06:00.861
So it's nice, man.
I had an interesting family growing up.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.780
My father was 70 years old
when I was born, okay.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.741
True story. I'm not joking,
my dad was born in 1910.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.743
I was born in 1980.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.538
Which basically makes me
a stand-up comedian.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.292
It was kinda cool growin' up
with a dad in his 70's,

06:15.374 --> 06:18.461
because of the time we would spend.
Shortly after I was born,

06:18.545 --> 06:19.462
my dad had a stroke.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.341
So, we were both learnin' to walk
at the same time.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.595
We used to play games like catch or don't.

06:29.639 --> 06:34.936
And my favorite: "Is Dad sleeping,
or is he no longer with us?"

06:35.020 --> 06:38.232
"It's your turn to hold
the mirror under his nose."

06:38.315 --> 06:41.818
My mom used to make us hold a mirror
under his nose when he was taking a nap

06:41.902 --> 06:43.904
to see if it would fog up or not.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.488
I swear to God, not joking.

06:45.572 --> 06:49.492
And the kids at school would be like,
"Well, my dad could beat up your dad."

06:49.576 --> 06:51.870
I'd be like, "No shit, man."

06:51.953 --> 06:55.498
Your dad has more organs than my dad...

06:55.582 --> 06:58.752
but my dad used to bang your grandmother.

07:00.712 --> 07:04.465
Back before they had protection,
when all you wore was hope.

07:05.884 --> 07:10.097
"You got any condoms?"
"No, but I got this here."

07:10.180 --> 07:12.515
That's that Alabama birth control, baby.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.604
And it's crossin' state lines.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.816
And my friends are like, "Theo, you
shouldn't make fun of your conception.

07:21.900 --> 07:25.112
You should be happy you were born.
You were that lucky sperm."

07:25.195 --> 07:26.613
I'm like, "Lucky sperm?

07:26.696 --> 07:29.824
I shot out of a 70-year-old cannon, bro."

07:29.908 --> 07:32.327
I was the only sperm.

07:33.370 --> 07:37.416
I had to shut down the nuts.
I had to close all the windows,

07:37.498 --> 07:39.667
fuckin' sweep up.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.174
On the way out,
I passed a skeleton of a sperm

07:46.258 --> 07:49.970
wearing a "Vote for
Lyndon B. Johnson" button.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.600
That's not an orgasm.
That's musket fire.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.355
So when I say I'm happy
to be somewhere, I'm just happy to be.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.689
Anywhere.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.777
Except at Denny's. They a bunch
of child molesters over there.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.114
Y'all got Denny's here?

08:09.197 --> 08:10.615
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

08:10.698 --> 08:12.367
Fuck Denny's, bruh.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.494
Fuck Denny's, man.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.456
I wish people would quit
shootin' up movie theaters

08:17.538 --> 08:19.958
and shoot up a fuckin' Denny's, okay.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.210
'Cause if you get gunned up
at a Denny's,

08:22.294 --> 08:24.463
that's on you, playboy.

08:24.545 --> 08:29.176
Have some respect and take your family
to IHOP like a real man.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.804
Denny's suck. Everything at Denny's
tastes like eggs and onions.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.222
Everything.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.558
The air, the pie,

08:37.642 --> 08:41.104
even the silverware if you
just run in there and lick 'em.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.981
That place is a shithole.

08:43.063 --> 08:46.567
What do they clean the tables with?
Syrup?

08:46.651 --> 08:49.863
Like once you sit down,
you can't even get up.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.615
"Guess we're staying for lunch.
I'm trapped!"

08:53.950 --> 08:58.538
And all the waitresses look like shit
at every location.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.040
How do they do it?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.793
They even have a job application?

09:03.877 --> 09:08.589
Or they just have like a special mirror,
and if you look like shit...

09:08.673 --> 09:11.301
then you're on staff, Cynthia.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.678
But you gotta wear a hat,

09:13.761 --> 09:17.098
'cause nothing looks better
than shit in a hat!

09:18.099 --> 09:20.643
"Put on your hat, shitty. Waffle up."

09:21.728 --> 09:24.689
Fuckin' hate Denny's, bro.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.484
And half the waitresses got whiskers.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.279
Would you shave your ladies, Denny?

09:31.363 --> 09:34.991
Shave your ladies before
you put them on the dance floor.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.743
Lady look like a damn cat.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.954
"Meow! Meow!
Meow-come to Denny's!

09:40.038 --> 09:41.706
[Cat sounds]

09:41.915 --> 09:43.666
Sorry for the bad service.

09:43.750 --> 09:48.129
I just gave birth to a bunch of babies
in a cardboard box in the kitchen.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.965
And we's all out of milk."

09:51.049 --> 09:52.633
Fuckin' hate Denny's, bro.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.636
I hate Denny's,
and I keep going back there!

09:55.720 --> 09:57.805
I keep going back.

09:57.889 --> 10:01.642
This me every time I leave Denny's.
"Man, fuck this place, man."

10:01.726 --> 10:04.645
A week later,
"Yes, ma'am, table for one, please.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.856
By the window?
Yes, ma'am, thank you. Yeah.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.360
In case there's a drive-by,
I go down with this shithole.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.445
Thank you."

10:11.528 --> 10:14.448
Fuckin' hate Denny's, man.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.825
Oh, I don't know why
it just makes me so mad.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.912
I gotta quit going, man.
I'm gonna quit.

10:20.995 --> 10:24.458
I used to go a lot 'cause
my ex-girlfriend lived by a Denny's,

10:24.541 --> 10:26.126
'cause she was a drug addict.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.294
And...

10:27.377 --> 10:29.921
and so, I used to go there
and use the shitters,

10:30.004 --> 10:32.299
'cause I didn't wanna use 'em
by her house.

10:32.382 --> 10:33.967
So I'd go use Denny's shitters.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.177
But not anymore, man.
Fuck that, dude.

10:36.261 --> 10:39.514
I'll shit outside, son,
like one of God's boys. Turn up.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.231
What else is going on, man?

10:48.315 --> 10:51.234
Just been chasin' these hos, really.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.862
No offense, hos.
Just trying to meet a good lady.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.948
I see some of y'all got one.
Good on you.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.825
Some lovely ladies here tonight.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.120
It's tough, you gotta have money
these days to get a woman.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.871
And I don't blame you ladies.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.374
Who wants to fuck some poor guy?

11:06.458 --> 11:08.209
That's nasty.

11:09.377 --> 11:15.091
You get done banging,
you're just laying there all poor.

11:15.175 --> 11:20.096
"Can I get you a towel that won't match
any of the other towels?

11:21.306 --> 11:23.183
What about some chips?

11:24.267 --> 11:26.520
Wanna split a bag of chips with daddy?

11:27.604 --> 11:31.732
Some chips, baby. Wanna calorie up
after that bang, wildcat?"

11:33.485 --> 11:37.197
Gotta have money to get the ladies, man.
You gotta have nice shit.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.450
I don't have nice shit.
I got the other shit.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.243
I don't have a nice apartment.

11:42.327 --> 11:46.914
This is how I cheat, I put all my
nicest stuff right by the door, right?

11:46.998 --> 11:49.209
So it looks nice when you come in.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.462
"Yeah, just step over that new toaster!

11:52.546 --> 11:53.796
Nice!

11:54.881 --> 11:58.468
Just set your purse
by that <i>Sopranos</i> box set.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.136
Haters welcome."

12:01.804 --> 12:04.098
- [Audience member] Yep!
- I don't have a nice car.

12:04.182 --> 12:07.519
I have that car where you act like you
don't remember where you parked,

12:07.602 --> 12:09.896
but you're standing
right next to your car.

12:09.979 --> 12:14.192
And when nobody's looking,
you fuckin' get in and you escape.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.070
It looks like you're stealing
your own car.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.366
You tell your friends it's a rental.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.994
They're like, "They're renting
'97 Accords to people?"

12:27.247 --> 12:31.418
Like, "Yeah, I'm just driving
it for charity, actually, yeah.

12:31.501 --> 12:35.338
Yeah, every time I floor it,
a blind boy can see four seconds.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.131
So he gets that pop, you know.

12:37.215 --> 12:41.428
So, I get a lot of speeding tickets,
you know, for his little dark ass."

12:42.929 --> 12:46.224
No offense, if anybody is blind either.

12:46.307 --> 12:50.687
My friend Maurice is blind,
and he said it ain't that bad in there.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.318
But you gotta have money
to get the ladies.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.572
If you don't have money, you gotta have
the other money: drugs.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.741
Especially in L.A.,
man, that's where I live now.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.118
Them girls out there
a bunch of coke-ghosts.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.578
That's what I call them.

13:06.661 --> 13:09.122
Coke-ghosts, baby,
'cause they're invisible.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.499
They don't answer your calls,
your texts,

13:11.583 --> 13:13.918
but you break out
a little bag of snow-caine,

13:14.001 --> 13:16.296
they fuckin' show up
out of thin air.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.880
Like, "Blow!

13:18.089 --> 13:21.301
Blow!"

13:22.218 --> 13:24.803
Then they're angry when you wanna
get 'em in the sheets.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.557
I'm like, "Bitch, you're a ghost!

13:27.641 --> 13:30.310
This is your natural attire.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.810
Now come to daddy."

13:33.563 --> 13:36.815
And if you don't have money or drugs,
you gotta be yourself.

13:36.899 --> 13:40.069
Fuck that, man.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.740
Last thing I'm doing is being myself.
Not on my watch!

13:45.116 --> 13:48.244
What am I gonna say to a girl?
"Hey, my name is Theo.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.498
Mostly, I just Netflix
and keep my hopes up."

13:54.709 --> 13:57.128
You'll be alone forever!

13:58.379 --> 14:01.675
But these days you don't have to be
yourself 'cause they have Internet.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.259
You can be whatever you want.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.886
You could be a pineapple.
You could be dead.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.474
You can be whatever you want, man.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.392
I met a girl recently online.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.020
I hit her up,
I said, "Let's get some coffee."

14:14.103 --> 14:16.897
So, she write me back.
She said, "Coffee's boring.

14:16.981 --> 14:20.485
Didn't you read my profile?
I'm adventurous.

14:20.568 --> 14:25.156
I wanna go skydiving on our first date."
[Whines]

14:27.367 --> 14:31.871
And nowhere in my budget is there
skydiving-for-unknown-bitches money.

14:34.332 --> 14:38.419
That shit ain't hittin' my bottom line.
I keep unknown bitches at sea level.

14:39.629 --> 14:43.341
So, I wrote her back.
I said, "Well, listen here, fancy,

14:43.424 --> 14:46.803
I happen to live
on the 11th floor of my building.

14:47.846 --> 14:52.350
Why don't you come over here,
I'll assist you off the balcony

14:52.433 --> 14:54.268
in a windbreaker.

14:54.352 --> 14:57.605
If you're still feeling all adventurous
down on the flower beds,

14:57.689 --> 15:00.692
I'll get your newly-crippled ass
a coffee, then.

15:00.775 --> 15:03.236
But the caffeine ain't gonna
save your legs,

15:03.319 --> 15:04.738
you greedy little gremlin."

15:04.821 --> 15:06.614
And now I'm angry.

15:06.698 --> 15:10.326
Now, I'm angry at a woman
that I've never even met.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.952
Thanks, Internet!

15:12.953 --> 15:17.333
Do you know what it's like to be angry
at bitches you don't even know?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.627
My buddy Sherman's like,
"What's wrong?"

15:19.711 --> 15:20.920
I'm like, "This bitch!"

15:21.003 --> 15:23.631
He's like, "Who?"
I'm like, "I don't know!

15:24.632 --> 15:26.718
Invisible bitches, Sherman!

15:28.344 --> 15:30.764
She's a skydiver.
Let's wait for her ass."

15:33.391 --> 15:36.143
"How will we know when she gets here
if she's invisible?"

15:36.227 --> 15:37.771
"I don't know!

15:37.854 --> 15:41.566
Wait till you feel 'bitch' in the air.
That's probably her!"

15:41.649 --> 15:45.945
He's like, "Relax, Little Bear.
You need to go to yoga, Little Bear."

15:46.028 --> 15:48.698
"Quit fuckin'
callin' me 'Little Bear,' Sherman.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.117
Little bears ain't in their 30s,
you idiot."

15:54.412 --> 15:56.831
I get frustrated, man.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.041
I get frustrated real easy, you know.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.294
You ever get frustrated, man?

16:01.377 --> 16:03.671
- [Man] All the time.
- How do you relax?

16:04.923 --> 16:07.174
You don't? [Laughing]
Okay, right on.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.553
You just gon' keep
stressing till you pop, huh?

16:10.637 --> 16:12.221
That's one way to do it, man.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.890
Gets you to heaven.

16:15.182 --> 16:18.185
But, yeah, it's hard, man,
it's hard to relax.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.481
I'm not good at it, man.

16:21.564 --> 16:25.025
I tried the marijuanas. I know a
lot of people's on the marijuanas.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.569
And I'm not good at 'em, man.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.447
I get high, I just get real paranoid,
you know?

16:29.530 --> 16:32.742
It's like my whole head
turns into a haunted house.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.788
I'm like, "What the fuck was that?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.081
Oh, an idea.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.713
This shit's strong, man."

16:46.547 --> 16:49.383
Then I tried yoga.
I don't know if you've been to yoga.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.595
I don't know if you've been to this deal.
Okay?

16:53.095 --> 16:55.723
If you haven't been, it's like...

16:56.223 --> 16:59.602
It's like fuckin',
but by yourself, real slowly.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.314
And it's awkward
'cause all the ladies in there

17:03.397 --> 17:05.858
are sweatin' out of their crotches
a little bit.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.694
What is the deal, ladies, huh?
Somethin' bit you?

17:08.778 --> 17:10.864
What happened, huh?

17:10.946 --> 17:12.365
What is going on?

17:12.448 --> 17:16.076
Put a little powder in your pants
before you go in there. Starch up!

17:16.160 --> 17:18.872
Starch up, drink a Red Bull, "G" up!

17:18.954 --> 17:22.458
What, you hide an armpit in your crotch?
Get your life together!

17:22.541 --> 17:24.627
Huh? Huh?

17:24.711 --> 17:27.505
Wear a cup, we don't care.
Just get it together.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.466
What if I went around
just frothing at the balls all day

17:30.550 --> 17:34.345
like I had a little St. Bernard
living behind my nuts?

17:34.428 --> 17:36.597
"Get back there, buddy.
Get back there."

17:39.266 --> 17:40.476
"G" up, ladies.

17:42.353 --> 17:45.982
They need to quit marketing yoga to dudes.
Yoga ain't for dudes.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.151
"Hey, bro, want to do a bunch of shit
you couldn't do?"

17:50.403 --> 17:52.446
"Fuck, no, you creep."

17:54.866 --> 17:57.076
Touch my feet.
I ain't touching my feet.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.707
That's why God put 'em down there,
so I wouldn't be messing with 'em,

18:02.790 --> 18:04.417
you little sinner.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.794
Yoga ain't for dudes, man.

18:06.878 --> 18:10.882
If my grandfather walked in on six of
his friends stretching at the same time,

18:10.965 --> 18:13.175
he'd hit 'em with a fucking shovel, okay?

18:13.259 --> 18:14.802
This shit ain't Christian!

18:14.886 --> 18:18.097
"You men are stretching and don't
even know each other's names!

18:18.180 --> 18:20.892
What are you doing?
Look at your life!"

18:24.520 --> 18:28.107
Then they have some guy
who works in the yoga studio.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.485
He looks like he got fired
from a Renaissance fair.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.947
He's like, "You're doing a great job."

18:34.030 --> 18:36.240
I'm like, "Who in the fuck are you?"

18:36.323 --> 18:37.700
He's like, "Open your hip."

18:37.784 --> 18:39.994
"I'll shit on your linoleum.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.081
I will shit in here, bro.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.791
I shit places, okay?

18:44.874 --> 18:47.085
Don't make me make this one of 'em."

18:49.087 --> 18:50.379
Yoga ain't for dudes.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.384
You want a yoga class for dudes,
here's the class, all right?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.804
It's called "Simon Says Don't Fart."

18:57.887 --> 18:59.597
That's the class.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.225
It lasts three minutes.
Every man farts, admits to it,

19:03.309 --> 19:05.770
introduces themselves to the other men
in the room,

19:05.853 --> 19:07.480
looking them square in the eyes,

19:07.563 --> 19:09.983
and leaves out of there
with Christ in his heart.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.112
Not this other cat factory
they're runnin'.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.494
I hate fartin'.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.413
I do. I always have.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.416
I always have, okay?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.335
I just hate it. I just don't--

19:30.294 --> 19:32.546
I can't believe it, man.

19:32.630 --> 19:35.967
Can you believe we're still fartin'?
We're farters.

19:36.050 --> 19:39.137
We think we know somethin'?
We're farters.

19:39.219 --> 19:43.474
We have air flyin' out of
our ass when it wants to.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.935
What the fuck, people?

19:46.019 --> 19:49.147
I have an app on my phone
that can take my blood pressure,

19:49.229 --> 19:52.859
but my asshole's
still livin' in the Wild West.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.322
If Apple would spend
a half hour on our sphincters,

19:58.405 --> 20:00.825
we wouldn't have this problem!

20:00.908 --> 20:02.743
Bring back Jobs!

20:06.413 --> 20:08.041
I hate farting, man.

20:08.124 --> 20:12.837
It's like your booty
trying to tell everybody all your secrets.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.049
It's like, "Don't smell that,
you'll know everything!"

20:18.258 --> 20:21.428
The worst is when you're by yourself,
living life at your house,

20:21.512 --> 20:23.014
and you're alone in the living room

20:23.097 --> 20:25.725
and you fuckin' cut a little bud
up into the air, son,

20:25.808 --> 20:27.060
'cause you know what's up,

20:27.143 --> 20:29.269
'cause you're probably going to heaven.

20:29.353 --> 20:33.900
Then somebody comes in the room
'cause they wanna "tell you somethin'."

20:33.983 --> 20:37.319
Now you gotta smell it all up
before they get close to you like--

20:37.403 --> 20:41.532
[inhaling, exhaling]

20:41.615 --> 20:43.910
"Hey, Danny!"

20:43.993 --> 20:46.120
You try to talk so loud, they can't smell.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.830
"How are ya?

20:47.914 --> 20:51.291
Let's go talk by the wall.
We never do that!

20:51.375 --> 20:56.255
Let's chat outside.
It's raining? Who cares! We're young!"

20:57.924 --> 20:59.592
I hate fartin'.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.306
We gotta beat it, man.

21:07.725 --> 21:08.893
We gotta beat it.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.354
I think we will.

21:14.232 --> 21:17.151
Who even invented fartin'?
You ever ask yourself?

21:17.235 --> 21:19.904
Or you're just fuckin' fartin',
you creeps.

21:22.907 --> 21:26.452
Probably somebody from Mississippi, okay?

21:26.535 --> 21:29.622
I don't know if you guys
have ever been to Mississippi or not.

21:29.705 --> 21:34.085
If you haven't, let me save you
a little bit of travel cash, okay?

21:34.168 --> 21:36.963
Go home, urinate in your toilet,

21:37.046 --> 21:39.132
and then get in there with it.

21:39.215 --> 21:43.510
"Ooh! Mississippi!"

21:43.594 --> 21:47.140
That place is a shithole, man.

21:47.223 --> 21:52.352
They need to give it to the Palestinians
and solve a damn world problem, okay?

21:52.436 --> 21:55.231
They still have slaves there!

21:55.273 --> 21:58.358
I was there a month ago,
I'm pumpin' gas at the gas station,

21:58.442 --> 22:00.069
a brother pops out of the bushes,

22:00.153 --> 22:03.405
he's like, "You got any news
from the North?"

22:04.157 --> 22:06.533
Like, fuck this place, dude!

22:07.367 --> 22:11.497
We need to get Morgan Freeman
out of there and then bomb that place.

22:12.456 --> 22:16.043
Not with bombs, but somethin'
that'll really scare 'em: books!

22:16.127 --> 22:19.338
[Shouting] "Algebra!"

22:20.923 --> 22:23.176
Fuckin' hate Mississippi, man.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.678
No offense if you're
from Mississippi either.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.601
I don't know anymore, man.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.189
I just don't know
what God wants us to do.

22:40.734 --> 22:41.694
[Sighs]

22:41.777 --> 22:44.655
So then I decided
I gotta get off the Interwebs.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.491
I was trying to meet a woman
on the Interwebs.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.910
Electrical humans.

22:49.994 --> 22:53.747
And I said I gotta meet a woman
the old-fashioned way. People interaction.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.750
I said I'm gonna ask out
the next woman that I see

22:56.834 --> 22:58.711
to practice asking a woman out,

22:58.794 --> 23:00.504
to practice ridin' the bike,

23:00.587 --> 23:02.422
'cause I forgot what it was like.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.509
So I met a girl,
she had a brown tooth.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.427
Just one, haters.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.139
But I'm a Christian.

23:10.223 --> 23:13.934
I'm gonna see the rest of her,
see what else the Lord has built

23:14.018 --> 23:17.521
around this little shantytown
in her mouth,

23:17.604 --> 23:20.774
around this little neck Bethlehem.

23:20.858 --> 23:25.988
I don't know her life. Maybe she got hit
by something brown right in the tooth.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.033
Maybe somebody had something brown
and they threw it somewhere

23:29.116 --> 23:31.827
and she was somewhere
and she got hit by it.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.205
Okay. I don't know her life.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.623
"Knock, knock." "Who's there?"
"Her life."

23:36.707 --> 23:38.125
"I don't know you, bro."

23:39.919 --> 23:42.296
So I asked her out, right?

23:42.380 --> 23:45.049
[Laughing] She said no.

23:46.424 --> 23:49.053
I was like, "You've got a brown tooth,
lady!

23:49.136 --> 23:51.389
Your face is dying!

23:51.471 --> 23:53.224
Your face is dying, okay?

23:53.307 --> 23:56.476
You's a couple candies
from being a jack-o'-lantern,

23:56.560 --> 23:57.937
you little sugar hooker.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.318
At least let me take you out
for a salad, girly.

24:04.402 --> 24:06.195
Get some baby carrots
in your mouth.

24:06.279 --> 24:11.409
Get some vitamins in your system.
Get your grill back on its feet."

24:11.491 --> 24:13.202
'Cause who am I supposed to ask out,

24:13.286 --> 24:17.373
if somebody whose face
is rottin' off their body is saying no?

24:18.582 --> 24:20.584
Huh? A headless woman?

24:20.667 --> 24:23.045
Where am I gonna meet
a headless woman, huh?

24:23.129 --> 24:27.967
A headless woman who just wears her hat
on her neck stub and goes to the bank?

24:29.218 --> 24:32.430
How am I supposed to be romantic
with a headless woman?

24:33.513 --> 24:35.015
We're at a nice restaurant,

24:35.099 --> 24:37.601
I'm just cutting a little piece
of steak and just...

24:37.684 --> 24:39.895
just shaking them into her neck hole?

24:40.938 --> 24:42.564
It ain't right.

24:48.362 --> 24:52.741
And I ain't being gay, man.
There's already too many gays out there.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.576
How many gays are out there, bro?

24:54.660 --> 24:57.955
- [Man] A hundred million.
- No, not a hundred million.

24:58.038 --> 25:00.040
Are you crazy, dude?

25:00.124 --> 25:04.337
Bro, they would be--
They'd be under everything, man.

25:06.005 --> 25:10.134
Bro, no. Not a hundred million.
Maybe eighty thousand.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.136
Ninety thousand. Maybe.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.847
With Obama in office, who knows?
He's probably...

25:14.930 --> 25:17.433
buying gays from other countries, maybe...

25:17.515 --> 25:20.853
Yeah. Probably gettin'
a bunch of Chinese gays soon.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.105
We don't know, is what I'm saying.

25:24.190 --> 25:27.109
We don't know how many people
this monkey bit, guys.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.406
We got no idea.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.659
And here's the kicker.
Science still thinks one monkey did this.

25:35.742 --> 25:38.871
Uh, hello, science.
Couple of monkey's did this, okay?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.666
No offense if you're gay either.

25:45.878 --> 25:50.590
I mean, I'll probably suck a little dick
at about 80. Know what I'm saying, bro?

25:50.674 --> 25:53.427
You suck a little dick at 80?

25:53.511 --> 25:55.721
Come on man, you in?

25:55.804 --> 25:58.391
Huh? What's it for? For suckin' dick!

25:58.474 --> 26:00.142
At 80, bro?

26:00.226 --> 26:01.394
You busy?

26:03.354 --> 26:06.357
You're not doing nothing at 80,
just sitting by the window.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.485
Wherever you go at 80,
they put you by the window.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.445
"Put Pop-Pop by the window!

26:11.529 --> 26:13.780
Pop-Pop's here,
put him by the window!"

26:13.864 --> 26:16.158
They don't even fucking ask Pop-Pop.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.785
Any fucking window,
they just wheel you over to it.

26:18.869 --> 26:21.621
"That's Pop-Pop.
That's your window."

26:21.705 --> 26:26.210
You ain't gonna wheel back one day
and huff your boy off once?

26:26.293 --> 26:29.922
Add a little flavor to Pop-Pop's life.
Come on, man.

26:31.173 --> 26:34.552
It's not gay at 80, bro. It's chill.

26:35.969 --> 26:39.098
It's just like, "Grandpa is crazy.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.683
But he's staying active."

26:44.562 --> 26:47.481
What you worried about, the feeling?

26:47.565 --> 26:49.442
You're not gonna feel it.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.944
At 80, bro, you're not gonna feel it, man.

26:52.027 --> 26:54.488
You've got no feeling left
in your mouth at 80!

26:54.572 --> 26:56.949
All your feelings gone to heaven.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.535
Everything just feel like a warm water.

26:59.617 --> 27:03.372
Probably like somebody trying to sneak
a fish stick into your mouth.

27:03.456 --> 27:05.874
"Who's trying to give me this fish stick?

27:05.958 --> 27:08.377
Old Pop-Pop didn't order no fish sticks!"

27:09.462 --> 27:13.299
It's probably like eating a hot dog
that's fighting back a little.

27:15.426 --> 27:17.136
Come on, man.

27:17.970 --> 27:21.599
You afraid to suck a little dick?
That's the gayest thing I've heard.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.729
You've changed, man.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.568
Being gay has changed, man.

27:32.650 --> 27:35.446
Being gay's changed.
Now gay dudes are just like, "I'm gay!"

27:35.529 --> 27:38.324
That's fine. It's the way
it always should have been.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.076
Let's not forget the OGs
of the game, baby.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.829
Let's not forget
our fathers and stepfathers,

27:43.912 --> 27:46.457
who'd meet up behind Shoney's
on their lunch break

27:46.540 --> 27:49.585
and tug uglies and go back home
to their fucking families and kids.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.878
Let's get a round of applause
for those men.

27:53.046 --> 27:56.342
The OGs, baby. The Original Gays.

28:01.639 --> 28:03.932
Some guys are too gay these days,
though, bro.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.769
Super gays, the kind of gay dudes
where even my gay friends are like,

28:07.853 --> 28:10.272
"This bitch needs to chill out a little."

28:12.816 --> 28:15.027
This guy came up to me
the other day in L.A., man.

28:15.110 --> 28:18.531
He had all his stuff
in an Easter basket.

28:18.614 --> 28:23.494
He had his phone and monies
in an Easter basket.

28:23.577 --> 28:26.455
And he said he's lost,
he needs directions.

28:26.539 --> 28:29.249
I said, "I can't help you
get anywhere, bro,

28:29.333 --> 28:32.252
not if you frikking
bringing your own Easter."

28:33.337 --> 28:35.422
You can always find a super gay dude.

28:35.506 --> 28:38.133
And it's always a frikking white dude.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.927
And he's always standing
somewhere like this.

28:41.011 --> 28:43.514
And he's always in
a troubled neighborhood.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.599
And he's standing there like this.

28:45.974 --> 28:49.936
[Shivering]

28:52.523 --> 28:54.983
Like people are beating him
with soft cold dicks,

28:55.067 --> 28:57.486
but nobody's beating him
with soft cold dicks!

28:57.570 --> 28:59.405
It's in his brains.

29:01.865 --> 29:05.744
And he's got on Daisy Dukes,
but more Daisy than Duke. Okay?

29:05.827 --> 29:09.039
And he's got bright white legs,
like, Boo-Radley white,

29:09.122 --> 29:12.167
like tall sacks of soft cream
holding him up.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.086
And he don't even look like a fellow.

29:14.169 --> 29:17.756
He looks like a premature baby
somebody stretched up real tall

29:17.839 --> 29:19.299
and put a little tank top on him.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.927
And it looks like he don't even
have a spine in his body.

29:22.010 --> 29:25.013
Like, in the morning
he was down like this in a little pile.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.265
And then he just... [inhales]

29:26.348 --> 29:28.601
caught a whiff of dick in the distance,

29:28.684 --> 29:31.103
and it's been holding him up all day long.

29:31.186 --> 29:34.189
Like, come on, bro.
That's super gay, right?

29:34.273 --> 29:37.817
What if I went around just being
super fucking straight all day?

29:37.901 --> 29:43.115
I just woke up and started throwing
footballs at hot bitches all day long.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.660
Or eating raw meat
and shitting in race cars?

29:46.744 --> 29:48.746
They would take me to jail.

29:50.456 --> 29:54.585
But bro-bro's doing BYO Easter,
and I gotta act like everything is normal?

29:54.668 --> 29:56.670
Come on, man!

29:56.754 --> 29:59.298
Just be regular gay, man.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.342
You didn't win somethin'.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.890
'Cause we've all been a little gay, bro.
You've been there? Just nod.

30:11.143 --> 30:14.271
I've been gay, bro.
I'll tell you about it, man.

30:14.354 --> 30:17.065
First time I was gay,
I was 11 years old, okay?

30:17.149 --> 30:19.401
The only time that I was 11.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.404
And I was at the movie theater
in my town.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.073
I grew up in a small town
called Covington, Louisiana,

30:25.157 --> 30:27.785
not far from here, okay?
You know it?

30:28.327 --> 30:30.829
Beautiful place, man. Beautiful place.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.165
Lee Harvey Oswald
went to our middle school.

30:33.248 --> 30:37.043
True story. Pistol Pete Maravich
lived and died in our town.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.171
So... two good shooters.

30:41.047 --> 30:44.718
Tulane University had their
primate testing facility center in town,

30:44.802 --> 30:47.304
and in 1994, 70 infected monkeys got out,

30:47.387 --> 30:51.183
and they let us out of YMCA summer camp
to help the police look for them.

30:51.266 --> 30:54.812
So what the fuck
have you done with your life?

30:54.894 --> 30:58.816
Until you and 11 kids
you barely know in wet bathing suits

30:58.940 --> 31:02.486
have surrounded six chimpanzees
outside of a Kenny Rogers Roasters,

31:02.569 --> 31:05.197
you probably really don't know yourself.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.454
I'm at the movie theater in our town.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.748
I'm there with my girlfriend.
She looked like a boy.

31:14.832 --> 31:18.585
But that's not the gay part of the story,
is it, conclusion-jumpers?

31:18.669 --> 31:21.672
She looked like a boy because
they only had one haircut in our town

31:21.755 --> 31:23.382
because Mr. Ray was our bus driver.

31:23.465 --> 31:27.052
On the third Thursday of the month,
he would park the bus on the way home.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.638
You had three dollars,
you would hold your money up.

31:29.722 --> 31:30.972
He was also the barber.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.392
He would clip everybody out
that had their monies up.

31:33.475 --> 31:38.397
He only knew one hairstyle. It was kind
of like this Polish lesbian cut.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.024
Anyway, that month me and my girl
had a bit of spending cash

31:41.107 --> 31:44.069
and we were sitting at the movie theater.
Our shit's fresh.

31:45.404 --> 31:49.825
Now, the movie that had come to town
was called <i>Pumpkinhead.</i> A scary movie.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.993
It was a film built for fear.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.496
So we're sitting there,
just ready to be scared.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.750
There's an older boy sitting next to me.
He was 16 years old.

31:57.833 --> 32:01.545
During the film, he got himself
a hand job from his girlfriend,

32:01.628 --> 32:04.172
and he ejaculated onto my arm.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.926
It was a pretty decent amount.

32:09.052 --> 32:13.849
And I only had 11 years worth of arm
at the time, so it looked like more then.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.142
But he really doused me up.

32:17.394 --> 32:20.689
And I was like, "Holy shit, man.
They got me," you know?

32:20.773 --> 32:22.524
"I'm gay."

32:22.608 --> 32:24.651
So... I'm not joking, man.

32:24.735 --> 32:28.697
For three months, I thought
I was a young homosexual. You know?

32:28.781 --> 32:33.452
And I broke up with my girlfriend.
I started jogging.

32:35.662 --> 32:41.293
And then I'm sitting there at Christmas,
I'm crying and wearing all these scarves.

32:41.376 --> 32:42.586
I'm serious, man.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.880
My brother is like,
"What the fuck, dude?

32:44.963 --> 32:47.633
Mom's pissed
you're wearing all her scarves."

32:47.716 --> 32:50.260
I was like,
"I'm a young homosexual, man.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.930
We're just trying to live our lives."

32:53.012 --> 32:55.348
He's like, "What are you talking about?"

32:55.432 --> 32:59.686
"They were getting people
at <i>Pumpkinhead.</i> And they got me.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.438
Where were you?"

33:01.521 --> 33:03.816
He's like,
"I don't know if you're gay or not,

33:03.899 --> 33:07.152
but you're the dumbest person
I've ever met in my life."

33:07.235 --> 33:09.738
Then he beat my ass, actually.

33:09.822 --> 33:11.239
Is that a hate crime?

33:12.240 --> 33:14.827
I think I got hate-crimed, dude.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.829
I knew I thought I got hate-crimed.

33:20.123 --> 33:24.920
But here's the wild part of that story.
Here's where the Lord really steps in.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.422
Because the fellow that got ejact
onto me...

33:28.841 --> 33:30.175
he died.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.930
He died. He died. He died. [Repeats]

33:35.013 --> 33:37.641
He died. He died...

33:37.724 --> 33:42.061
He died in a car accident.
He died of natural causes by a car.

33:43.229 --> 33:45.231
Sometimes I'll be sitting somewhere...

33:45.315 --> 33:47.484
thinking or not thinking about something,

33:47.567 --> 33:49.569
waiting for a thought
to come and find me.

33:50.988 --> 33:52.990
And I'll feel like...

33:53.072 --> 33:55.742
Let me say this right. I will feel like...

33:55.826 --> 33:58.244
this is, like, his arm a little.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.079
I swear to God, man.

34:00.163 --> 34:04.584
Because I'll just be sitting there
doing nothing, or maybe doing something.

34:04.668 --> 34:07.337
And my hand will go like that.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.630
But I won't want nothing.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.175
But it's like he wants something.

34:13.592 --> 34:17.222
Like he trying to get something.
Like he wants a candy.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.641
'Cause I wouldn't be
reaching for no candies

34:19.725 --> 34:22.143
'cause I know we don't keep candies
in the house.

34:22.226 --> 34:26.063
It's like he's reaching for a candy,
like, he trying to get a butterscotch.

34:33.362 --> 34:37.116
The second time I was gay
was when I met Brad Pitt.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.828
'Cause I met Brad Pitt, dude.
I did. I met Brad Pitt.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.621
The real one,
the only one God ever made.

34:42.706 --> 34:45.042
Met his ass, okay?

34:45.123 --> 34:47.502
This is what happened.
Listen up, haters.

34:48.712 --> 34:50.463
So it's a beautiful day out.

34:51.672 --> 34:55.217
'Cause Brad only lives on beautiful days.

34:55.301 --> 34:59.222
And I'm walking. I'm going to
an audition on the Fox lot in Los Angeles.

34:59.305 --> 35:03.476
Probably for a big movie like <i>League
of their Own II</i> or something heavy.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.645
The sun is hitting me while I walk.

35:05.729 --> 35:09.900
The rays are just coming down
and just touching me on my neck and hair.

35:09.983 --> 35:13.820
Like the Lord just petting me,
letting me know I'm still his boy.

35:13.904 --> 35:15.697
In the distance I see a man, right?

35:15.781 --> 35:18.992
I say a man, but I'm talking about
the most beautiful woman

35:19.076 --> 35:21.703
you've ever seen wrapped up in a man.

35:21.787 --> 35:24.539
He didn't even look human.
He looked like...

35:24.623 --> 35:28.710
Poseidon had been raising a secret
little baby boy down in the ocean.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.545
And when that boy was full grown,

35:30.629 --> 35:33.172
he set him on the land
and said, "Go, boy.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.883
You live out there now."

35:34.967 --> 35:38.261
Immediately, I was gay. Okay?

35:38.344 --> 35:40.847
Like-- Poof-- Gay.

35:41.723 --> 35:45.393
So, I'm walking and he's walking,
we're both going to the same building.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.311
It's a true story.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.772
I don't even know
if Brad Pitt even walks anymore,

35:48.855 --> 35:52.025
or if there's an agreement now
between gravity and Mother Nature

35:52.109 --> 35:53.526
and the grace of God,

35:53.610 --> 35:57.072
where they just amicably move
little Bradley wherever he needs to go.

35:57.155 --> 36:01.242
Like, God has a chessboard with one piece
and it's Brad-fucking-Pitt.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.702
Checkmate life, right?

36:02.786 --> 36:04.245
So, I'm walking, he's gliding.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.124
We're both going to the same building,
I'm looking at him,

36:07.206 --> 36:10.335
and I'm thinking to myself,
"Man, that looks like Brad Pitt."

36:10.418 --> 36:13.797
And then my brain goes,
"'Cause that is Brad Pitt, playboy."

36:13.880 --> 36:17.634
Part of my brain is black and gets
a little 'hood with the rest of my brain.

36:17.717 --> 36:21.471
I don't know what to do now,
'cause they don't teach you what to do

36:21.554 --> 36:23.765
when you're about to meet Brad Pitt.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.851
They teach us other things.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.937
If you're on fire, little buddy,
stop, drop and roll.

36:29.021 --> 36:33.066
If you're going to argue with a short man,
don't argue with him in a prone position.

36:33.150 --> 36:36.153
Argue with him like this
and be ready for his little actions.

36:37.236 --> 36:40.406
But they don't teach you
how to meet Brad-frikking-Pitt

36:40.490 --> 36:42.200
in Brad-frikking-person, right?

36:42.283 --> 36:44.077
So I'm walking, he's gliding.

36:44.161 --> 36:47.873
We're going to the same building,
me and the only Brad Pitt God ever made.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.124
Brad Pitt.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.210
And he was wearing--
He was wearing everything.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.671
He had on, like, a tuxedo.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.381
And he was on a horseback.

36:58.091 --> 37:00.426
And he had on furs,
but, like, exotic furs.

37:00.510 --> 37:04.514
Animals we've never even seen,
like, Chimpanebras and alapacakeets.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.059
And he had Lorax
coming off his shoulders,

37:07.142 --> 37:09.769
and he had Care Bear cuff
on his boot-tops and wrists.

37:09.853 --> 37:12.105
And... he had no shirt on.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.901
So he's coming from that way,
I'm coming this way.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.527
Double doors on the building.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.279
We get to the front of this building
at the same moment,

37:20.363 --> 37:22.032
and I'm thinking to myself,

37:22.115 --> 37:25.660
"I'll get the door,
'cause Brad's done a lot for me."

37:25.744 --> 37:28.496
So I grab the door on the left
and I pull it.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.249
You know how some asshole
always locks the door on the left?

37:31.332 --> 37:33.668
That asshole works here. Okay?

37:33.752 --> 37:35.670
So, I pull it and it's locked.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.090
Usually, you would just
open the other door,

37:38.173 --> 37:41.342
but for some reason,
I just keep pulling on this locked door

37:41.426 --> 37:45.013
like it's gonna start up
and I'm-a mow the yard with it, right?

37:45.097 --> 37:48.683
And Brad Pitt is standing right here.
The only one that God has.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.186
And you can feel him
when he's standing somewhere

37:51.269 --> 37:53.688
'cause he's got this invisible energy
comin' off him,

37:53.772 --> 37:57.358
'cause he's made out of
vagina and diamonds.

37:57.442 --> 38:02.072
So, I'm pulling on this door and he goes,
"You got it, man?"

38:02.155 --> 38:05.909
'Cause that's what Brad Pitt say
when shit ain't going well.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.204
So I look back at him like this.

38:09.287 --> 38:13.750
If you ever looked right at him up close,
it's like staring directly into the sun,

38:13.833 --> 38:16.878
but with a little bit
of Brad Pitt in there.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.547
I look back at him like this
and I say, "I got it, man."

38:19.631 --> 38:22.050
That's what my brain said.
My mouth goes...

38:22.134 --> 38:26.054
[stuttering]

38:26.138 --> 38:30.058
Right to his face!
[Stuttering]

38:30.142 --> 38:37.107
Like an Asian that won't start.
[Stuttering]

38:37.274 --> 38:40.443
Thankfully he speaks [stuttering],

38:40.526 --> 38:43.822
'cause he's been around social roaches
like your boy.

38:43.905 --> 38:47.075
I gotta open door number two,
but I don't want this interaction to end.

38:47.159 --> 38:50.453
We might hug, we might fuck a little.
This is Hollywood, son.

38:50.536 --> 38:54.457
This is my chance
with Brad-frikkin'-Pitt, you animals.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.293
So, door number two, okay?

38:56.375 --> 38:58.544
Naturally,
I could just open that door,

38:58.628 --> 39:02.381
walk in this building,
let this man live his life.

39:02.465 --> 39:07.012
Or I could open the door for him,
let him walk by and just live my own life.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.972
But this is what I did.
I open the door.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.640
As it swings open,

39:10.723 --> 39:13.185
I jump across and put my back
against the open door.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.896
Like, a way that people
don't open doors.

39:16.980 --> 39:19.941
He looks at me like,
"That ain't how people open doors."

39:21.442 --> 39:25.864
And I said, "I got it, man.
I used to work at a door store."

39:31.369 --> 39:33.621
I'm not joking man,
I door-stored him.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.457
Right to his face, dude.
Right to his Brad Pitt face.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.169
And... and he goes...

39:39.336 --> 39:40.378
"Ha-ha."

39:41.671 --> 39:43.089
That's what he said.

39:43.756 --> 39:44.757
"Ha-ha."

39:46.009 --> 39:48.845
And I don't know
if you ever heard him laugh in person,

39:48.928 --> 39:51.430
but I mean, it's beautiful.

39:51.514 --> 39:56.435
You don't even hear it at first.
You just feel the laughter on your skin.

39:56.519 --> 39:59.522
When you finally hear his laugh,
I mean, it just...

39:59.605 --> 40:03.276
it sounds like a million babies
eating cookies at the same time.

40:04.443 --> 40:07.739
Right when I heard his laugh,
crop circles formed in my hair.

40:07.822 --> 40:11.326
And memories of making love
to a hundred women I never even met

40:11.409 --> 40:13.245
starting living in my heart.

40:13.328 --> 40:14.913
<i>Mi corazón.</i>

40:14.996 --> 40:17.957
So I'm just standing there
against this door, right?

40:18.041 --> 40:22.045
People are going in and out. I'm just
reduced to a concierge by this man.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.881
This lady comes runnin' up,
this straight-up street beast,

40:24.964 --> 40:28.760
and she's like,
"Did Brad Pitt just go in there?"

40:28.843 --> 40:32.430
I was like, "No, ma'am.
He went thattaway," you know?

40:34.473 --> 40:36.976
'Cause I ain't telling this bitch
where I keep him.

40:43.983 --> 40:46.986
Thank you. Thank you.

40:49.572 --> 40:53.576
And the third time I was gay
was just a general time.

40:53.659 --> 40:56.955
When I was younger we used to play
a game called "gay chicken."

40:57.038 --> 40:58.664
Anybody in the Navy?

40:59.124 --> 40:59.958
Uh...

41:00.041 --> 41:02.252
<i>Homosexualis con pollo.</i>

41:04.796 --> 41:09.592
It's like, you and your buddy stand there,
hold each other's penis, all right.

41:09.675 --> 41:11.928
First person to let go is gay.

41:13.638 --> 41:16.433
But, if you get an erection,
you're out.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.770
So you got to play offense
and defense, bro.

41:23.940 --> 41:27.485
The worst is when you start catching
their pulse a little.

41:27.568 --> 41:30.863
"Why you pump faking, homie?
You pump faking."

41:32.407 --> 41:35.452
You can't play with the brothers.
You use both hands...

41:35.534 --> 41:37.703
hard on the back, L5-S1.

41:38.621 --> 41:42.375
And you can't play with a Asian guy,
'cause you can't...

41:42.459 --> 41:45.211
You just gotta pinky swear with it.

41:45.295 --> 41:47.922
That's a different game,
that's called "broken promises."

41:48.631 --> 41:50.633
That's for the young bucks.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.677
That's for the young bucks, man.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.763
I was 11-7 in '92 actually.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.265
I was, man.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.017
They shut us down, though.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.146
Too many people watching.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.939
Fire hazard.

42:08.734 --> 42:10.945
I was having a tough time
meeting a good gal,

42:11.029 --> 42:13.948
my buddy said,
"Let me set you up on a blind date."

42:14.032 --> 42:17.535
I said, "All right man,
I can't drive my own life. You drive it."

42:18.661 --> 42:22.790
So, he set me up, and I got there early,
I'm ready to fuck a little.

42:24.125 --> 42:27.795
And I'm just waiting for this girl,
and then finally I see this girl.

42:27.879 --> 42:31.924
I'm like, "Oh, man,
I could've met this bitch myself."

42:33.134 --> 42:36.679
She was busted-looking, okay?
No offense if you're ugly.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.890
But she looked busted-up.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.351
She looked like she been
beaten up by animals.

42:41.434 --> 42:44.603
She been on a new TV show
called <i>Bear Beatings.</i>

42:44.687 --> 42:47.606
It was a two-part episode.
At the end of the first part,

42:47.690 --> 42:51.194
it was like, "Will these bears
continue to beat this bitch?"

42:51.277 --> 42:55.407
And the sequel was like, "These bears
are still beating this bitch!"

42:55.490 --> 42:58.034
I'm not saying
I look like anything special.

42:58.117 --> 43:02.288
I look like Patrick Swayze
and Shrek had a son. Okay?

43:02.372 --> 43:04.790
I look like The Grinch
That Stole Matt Damon.

43:06.751 --> 43:11.214
<i>♪ You're a mean one, Jason Bourne ♪</i>

43:11.297 --> 43:14.926
If you look at me from the side,
I look like I have bit of Down Syndrome.

43:17.262 --> 43:20.639
I can make that joke 'cause I actually
beat Down Syndrome in 1991.

43:20.723 --> 43:23.059
I'm in remission.
Praise God, baby.

43:24.060 --> 43:27.313
Amen.
That's where I'm from, dude.

43:27.397 --> 43:29.899
I'm from a neighborhood where if
you had a handicap,

43:30.358 --> 43:34.153
you better get your shit together,
get back on the street and make money.

43:34.237 --> 43:38.824
Toughest kid I've ever known was this boy
named Dairy, named after the food group.

43:38.908 --> 43:40.868
He was, yogurt and all.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.538
He had Down Syndrome,
wore a Scottie Pippen jersey

43:43.621 --> 43:47.208
and a gold chain every day of his life
and carried a fucking gun, son.

43:47.292 --> 43:49.794
"If he ain't got the money,
then pop, pop.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.045
Pop-pop!"

43:52.213 --> 43:55.508
I'm not joking, dude. He killed
seven pets in our neighborhood one year.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.221
He killed seven pets, bro.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.557
There ain't much you can do
when you got a DS fella

44:02.640 --> 44:04.850
spraying off against animals.

44:04.934 --> 44:07.895
We would call the police. They'd say,
"Y'all can't call us. Call a church.

44:07.979 --> 44:10.856
That boy is out of our jurisdiction,
praise God."

44:14.319 --> 44:18.197
What was I talking about?
Oh, the girl on the date.

44:18.281 --> 44:20.199
So, this girl looked wild, bro.

44:20.283 --> 44:22.577
You know, visually freelance.

44:23.119 --> 44:24.245
Um...

44:24.329 --> 44:26.289
Her eyes were real far apart.

44:26.372 --> 44:28.916
I don't know if that's
a new thing, ladies.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.671
I'm old-fashioned, I like more
of a localized face. You know, just...

44:33.754 --> 44:37.675
Just holdin' a little meetin'
by your nose, you know.

44:37.758 --> 44:40.678
Her eyes were just real far apart,
you know,

44:40.761 --> 44:43.722
like she wanted to be greedy
and see everything.

44:44.932 --> 44:48.894
The last second, the Lord just went
"tink" with one of her eyes.

44:50.021 --> 44:54.442
The whole time I'm talking to her,
I don't know which eye to look into.

44:54.526 --> 44:57.362
I'll just look back and forth
into each eye,

44:57.445 --> 45:00.823
like it's a threesome, but it's just us.

45:00.906 --> 45:03.784
"So good to see you--
What the fuck?

45:03.868 --> 45:05.953
Was your daddy a salmon?"

45:08.373 --> 45:11.959
Ladies, if your eyes real far apart,
give your girlfriend an eye marker,

45:12.043 --> 45:15.712
tell her to draw a little more eye
on the inside of each eye.

45:15.796 --> 45:18.299
Or draw a third eye in the middle.

45:18.383 --> 45:21.260
Play "guess which two I'm seeing out of"
with your mans.

45:21.344 --> 45:23.346
Help each other out.

45:25.806 --> 45:28.767
This lady had strong breath, too.
Kinda breath like-- "Whoo!

45:29.561 --> 45:30.853
Kill 'em!"

45:30.936 --> 45:32.522
Strong, bro. Just like--

45:32.605 --> 45:36.484
Like one of her lungs hooked
to her asshole. You're like, "Come on now.

45:36.568 --> 45:38.194
Come on, Jannie, you're talking booty."

45:39.987 --> 45:41.447
Strong, bro.

45:41.531 --> 45:43.282
Made me nervous.

45:43.366 --> 45:46.452
Ladies, if your friend have strong breath,
you have a responsibility.

45:46.536 --> 45:49.163
Get a little handful of mints
or cinnamons.

45:49.247 --> 45:53.042
Run by your friend,
throw them at her face like that.

45:53.125 --> 45:56.671
Or be more secretive about it,
like that. Okay?

45:56.753 --> 45:58.881
See if some get in her face holes.

45:58.964 --> 46:00.925
Or get a syringe full of peppermint,

46:01.008 --> 46:04.220
sneak up behind Smokey,
<i>Dexter</i> her in the neck.

46:04.303 --> 46:08.266
Start at the roots, work your way up.
Help each other out, ladies.

46:10.727 --> 46:13.396
Teamwork makes the dream work, okay?

46:14.771 --> 46:19.736
This girl had a big head on her, too.
She real, real, real extra-headed.

46:19.818 --> 46:22.572
I'm old-fashioned,
I like a regular-headed woman.

46:22.655 --> 46:24.657
I like a basic think piece.

46:26.367 --> 46:28.369
She was real extra-headed,

46:28.453 --> 46:32.498
like her neck had been
in a go-catch-something-big contest.

46:32.582 --> 46:35.042
Hurry, you're missing all the big stuff!

46:35.126 --> 46:37.712
Like the Lord had taken
her regular head off

46:37.794 --> 46:41.758
and dipped it in some breading
and then put it back on her neck.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.468
Made me nervous, man.

46:43.551 --> 46:46.262
Why is my buddy even setting me up
with a big-headed girl?

46:46.345 --> 46:49.098
I already have a big head.
What are we supposed to do?

46:49.181 --> 46:51.016
Have a big-headed little child?

46:51.100 --> 46:54.604
Can't even lift his beautiful
little bitty big-ass head.

46:54.687 --> 46:56.855
It's too heavy for his body
to get off the ground.

46:56.939 --> 47:00.401
He gotta learn to crawl side to side,
around it.

47:00.485 --> 47:03.321
He gotta play a clock
in all the school plays.

47:05.698 --> 47:09.076
Don't hook somebody up with the same shit
they already have.

47:09.160 --> 47:13.581
If you got a one-legged friend, don't hook
him up with another one-legged friend.

47:13.665 --> 47:14.666
What do think?

47:14.749 --> 47:18.961
They're just gonna lean against
each other somewhere where it's level?

47:19.044 --> 47:23.341
Fuck no, man! Two people
need at least three legs!

47:23.424 --> 47:26.927
Look at a leg chart, you animals!

47:30.389 --> 47:34.185
And ladies, if you got a big head,
work your head out.

47:35.269 --> 47:38.022
Do some laps around yourself, like that.

47:40.817 --> 47:44.153
Put on some head Spanx.
Spank your head up.

47:45.070 --> 47:46.489
Spank your head up, mama.

47:46.572 --> 47:49.575
I don't know if you guys know
what a Spanx are, it's a special suit

47:49.659 --> 47:52.077
they made for the ladies.
I think the Germans made it.

47:52.161 --> 47:55.498
It pushes all their body
into their shoes, okay?

47:56.499 --> 47:58.668
I call it "cramouflage."

48:00.127 --> 48:02.714
But we don't notice that,
we just see the "ba-bow."

48:02.797 --> 48:05.758
We don't see these tug boots,
carryin' the rest of 'em.

48:05.842 --> 48:12.515
Like-- [boat-like sounds]

48:12.598 --> 48:15.934
Goin' to the club.
[Boat sounds]

48:16.018 --> 48:18.103
We just see the "ba-bow," you know?

48:18.187 --> 48:21.691
Look like a sweet little vase
you wanna put all your dick flowers in.

48:23.359 --> 48:25.737
Then you get her home,
you crack off these Spanx,

48:25.820 --> 48:28.698
it's like opening up
a can of refrigerator biscuits.

48:28.781 --> 48:33.828
Like-- [popping]

48:42.169 --> 48:45.214
Like, "I-I'm just gonna jerk off
in the can.

48:46.131 --> 48:48.885
I'm tired, I got a headache.

48:48.967 --> 48:52.680
My headache's tired.
I love you."

48:57.059 --> 48:59.186
But we hooked up. Uh...

49:01.230 --> 49:04.108
Sometimes you gotta take one for the team,

49:04.191 --> 49:06.527
even if you was a free agent.

49:06.611 --> 49:09.488
We hooked up, actually
I was worried I mighta got her pregnant

49:09.572 --> 49:11.574
'cause the birth control
I was using,

49:11.657 --> 49:12.658
aim...

49:14.201 --> 49:16.454
doesn't always work so well, you know.

49:16.537 --> 49:19.998
I didn't want to have a baby with her,
'cause I don't even know her,

49:20.082 --> 49:21.709
which should hold up in court.

49:21.793 --> 49:26.255
"Yes, Your Honor, this is our boy,
Headrick, but I don't know her."

49:27.590 --> 49:30.008
Second of all, I didn't wanna have
a baby with her.

49:30.092 --> 49:32.678
This is kind of vain.
She had, like, a crazy tooth.

49:32.762 --> 49:35.556
You ever meet somebody
that have, like, a crazy tooth?

49:35.640 --> 49:39.852
Like way up here. Like it auditioned
to be a horn, but didn't get it.

49:40.227 --> 49:43.230
Way up here. Like, they smile
and then smile again,

49:43.314 --> 49:45.316
and you're like, "What the fuck?

49:45.399 --> 49:47.902
Where'd your grill get a balcony?"

49:47.984 --> 49:52.030
Just way up here, hiding in the attic
like John Wilkes Tooth,

49:52.114 --> 49:55.451
just ready to fuckin' pop out
and murder the president, son.

49:55.534 --> 49:58.203
Murder! Murder!

49:58.913 --> 50:01.874
And I didn't want our first baby
to have a special tooth

50:01.958 --> 50:05.336
sprouting out of his neck or back,
little Shark Week-er.

50:06.002 --> 50:09.590
Only get himself a job with the carnival,
working in a cage at night

50:09.674 --> 50:12.050
opening up mail off
his sharpened head tooth,

50:12.134 --> 50:15.304
doing special shows for businessmen.

50:18.724 --> 50:21.101
My boy ain't workin' in no cage.

50:26.273 --> 50:27.817
So we hooked up and...

50:28.985 --> 50:31.445
afterwards we're just layin' there,
me and her.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.865
Two children of the Lord,
done ate the apple.

50:34.866 --> 50:37.743
I'm kissing her on her neck up in here,
where all the sweet is,

50:37.827 --> 50:39.578
right here on the sugar shelf.

50:40.036 --> 50:43.958
Just rubbing my hand on her like this,
just being real natural.

50:46.460 --> 50:49.714
Like a gentleman.
Like a little husband.

50:49.797 --> 50:54.927
Just like a little handicapped fellow
petting a scared sheep. You know, just...

50:55.011 --> 50:58.639
"You quit shaking, Daisy,
that's just a storm coming, you see.

50:58.723 --> 51:02.058
You just keep growing your wool out,
my little mitten-maker.

51:02.142 --> 51:03.769
You want more Apple Jacks,
don't you?

51:03.853 --> 51:07.857
Don't you want more of daddy's
Apple Jacks, my little lady angel?"

51:08.941 --> 51:10.568
Just being real chill with her.

51:12.403 --> 51:14.446
And then I said,
"Are you on birth control?"

51:14.530 --> 51:17.992
She said no,
and that's when I got real nervous.

51:18.074 --> 51:21.077
Kind of felt like my heart
had to take a shit.

51:23.121 --> 51:25.958
And then I was like,
"If you had a baby, would you keep it,

51:26.042 --> 51:29.045
and would it be okay
if I just wrote y'all letters?"

51:29.127 --> 51:31.756
'Cause women love getting mail.

51:31.839 --> 51:34.008
And she goes,
"Actually, I can't conceive."

51:34.090 --> 51:37.720
And that's when I started running around
the room high-fiving shit.

51:37.803 --> 51:41.933
Just cheap shit she had on the walls,
like pictures of her family at the beach.

51:42.016 --> 51:45.770
She's like, "Calm down, it's real sad.
I've had two miscarriages."

51:45.853 --> 51:47.980
And that is very sad.
If somebody says that,

51:48.064 --> 51:51.609
you're supposed
to hug them or buy them a plant.

51:52.443 --> 51:55.071
When you're a comedian,
you don't think like that.

51:55.153 --> 51:57.573
The devil trying to get your brain.

51:57.656 --> 52:00.618
You say things you shouldn't say,
'cause the words go from your brain

52:00.701 --> 52:03.579
right out of your mouth,
not through your heart first.

52:03.662 --> 52:05.915
I was like,
"You've had two miscarriages?

52:05.998 --> 52:09.668
I feel lucky my penis lived
after it was in there."

52:22.723 --> 52:24.767
So that's what I've been doing.

52:27.311 --> 52:28.604
They're just jokes, people!

52:30.481 --> 52:32.108
It can't all be funny.

52:33.109 --> 52:34.735
It can't all be funny.

52:40.783 --> 52:43.577
And the Jews are clogging up the Internet.

52:47.706 --> 52:49.207
That's all for that.

52:53.045 --> 52:55.673
I think it was easier to meet a woman
like in the old days.

52:55.756 --> 53:00.260
I don't know how old some of you are,
but maybe the 1800s or whatever.

53:00.344 --> 53:03.597
Back then, you just walked out
of your house, if you were a man,

53:03.681 --> 53:06.684
hundreds of miles if you had to,
till you saw any woman,

53:06.767 --> 53:08.936
and you just started
walking back with her.

53:09.020 --> 53:10.646
She's like, "Where are we going?"

53:10.729 --> 53:12.773
You're like, "To the rest of your life."

53:13.482 --> 53:15.860
And that was a relationship.

53:15.943 --> 53:18.863
And if she got out of line,
you took her on a warning hike.

53:20.280 --> 53:23.784
And I'm not saying it was perfect,
I'm just saying that it worked.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.662
And the man went out
and did the world work.

53:26.745 --> 53:29.373
The woman stayed at home
and took care of family work.

53:29.456 --> 53:33.460
I don't think it was ideal for anybody,
but the kids were fat, the cat was fed.

53:33.544 --> 53:35.963
You got home, your wife
was there with the mail,

53:36.047 --> 53:38.090
like, "Tell me what the mail says!"

53:40.509 --> 53:44.930
And I'm not saying it was perfect.
I'm just saying that it worked.

53:45.014 --> 53:48.517
And then women started
wanting to do everything.

53:48.600 --> 53:51.603
"We wanna chew gum,
we wanna wear hats,

53:51.687 --> 53:54.982
we wanna drive big rigs,
we wanna CrossFit."

53:56.067 --> 53:58.861
"CrossFittin'?
What the fuck are y'all doing?

53:58.944 --> 54:02.322
Y'all are doing chin-ups
in an abandoned shed all morning?

54:02.406 --> 54:05.241
We're fucking starving at the house.

54:05.325 --> 54:07.536
Our boy can't read.

54:08.579 --> 54:11.123
And you're worried about muscle density?

54:11.623 --> 54:14.292
When I married you, you had an ass.
Now you got glutes?

54:14.376 --> 54:16.545
What are glutes?

54:16.628 --> 54:20.007
Don't make that thing
any harder for daddy to get into."

54:22.384 --> 54:25.429
And now they have a hundred machines
at the gym for women.

54:25.512 --> 54:28.348
And now y'all probably
feel obligated to use them all.

54:28.432 --> 54:31.476
When I was young, they had
four machines at the gym for ladies,

54:31.560 --> 54:33.562
and three of them were stoves.

54:35.231 --> 54:39.401
"I'm gonna do chest and tris.
Why don't you do that manicotti we love?"

54:41.445 --> 54:45.281
And I'm not saying it was perfect.
I'm saying that it worked.

54:46.784 --> 54:48.786
Here's what I really believe, ladies.

54:48.869 --> 54:52.998
A lot of relationships don't work anymore
because opposites attract.

54:53.082 --> 54:55.500
Ladies feel like
they have to do everything.

54:55.584 --> 54:57.502
Gotta feel like a ton of pressure.

54:57.586 --> 55:00.296
But if y'all are doing
all the women's and men's stuff,

55:00.380 --> 55:02.216
what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

55:02.298 --> 55:07.846
I have on facial moisturizer right now.
I don't know what's going on.

55:07.930 --> 55:12.392
You got women doin' dead lifts all day,
wondering why they don't have a boyfriend.

55:12.476 --> 55:14.310
'Cause you're it.

55:16.021 --> 55:20.192
I don't wanna hug a woman
and come in second!

55:20.276 --> 55:22.527
You gotta be the lady.
Put down the barbells.

55:22.611 --> 55:24.238
Pick up some flowers, look lost.

55:24.320 --> 55:27.491
You'll have a boyfriend in five minutes.

55:34.081 --> 55:36.167
We gotta stay in our own lanes.

55:36.250 --> 55:38.543
The irony is we have enough
in common, ladies.

55:38.627 --> 55:42.006
Women are always like,
"You men look good into your sixties.

55:42.089 --> 55:45.926
We start falling apart in our thirties."
That's bullshit.

55:46.010 --> 55:48.137
That's bullshit, man.

55:48.220 --> 55:52.266
I'm in my 30s. My hip clicks
for the first hour of every day.

55:52.348 --> 55:55.727
Just... [clicking]

55:55.811 --> 55:59.606
For no reason at all, I have a mating call
for women with osteoporosis

55:59.690 --> 56:03.485
built into my body. Okay?

56:03.568 --> 56:07.198
My body used to be separate parts.
Remember that, guys?

56:07.281 --> 56:09.700
When your shoulder
was separate from this,

56:09.783 --> 56:11.827
when your ass was separate
from whatever that is,

56:11.910 --> 56:14.454
when your stomach was separate
from your chest.

56:14.538 --> 56:19.668
Now it's like I'm living in a fat-muscle
onesie I can't find the zipper to.

56:19.751 --> 56:22.921
"Do you like my arm-leg-backceps?"

56:24.882 --> 56:26.591
I got gray hair. Is that scary?

56:26.675 --> 56:30.512
Yeah, ladies, that means
my head is dying.

56:30.595 --> 56:32.597
And the first thousand gray hairs,

56:32.681 --> 56:35.100
they don't grow in cool
like part of the hair party,

56:35.184 --> 56:38.645
they grow in all fuckin' crazy and swirly,
like they're on dope.

56:38.729 --> 56:40.356
Like they're crack hairs,

56:40.438 --> 56:44.568
like, "Damn, dog,
I'll suck your dick for some shampoo.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.571
Just comb me, homie."

56:50.406 --> 56:53.618
My nuts look different.
I used to have beautiful nuts.

56:53.702 --> 56:56.412
If I had my old nuts,
I'd bring them right to you,

56:56.496 --> 57:00.334
you could pass 'em to your friend and get
a look, get a snap with your phone.

57:00.416 --> 57:02.711
They was gorgeous.
Beautiful little nuts.

57:02.794 --> 57:05.381
Looked like the Lord
had one Christmas ornament,

57:05.463 --> 57:07.258
just hung it on my "D" branch,

57:07.341 --> 57:09.176
and went back to the Lord castle.

57:10.802 --> 57:12.137
And they were concise nuts.

57:12.221 --> 57:14.472
One had a good idea
and was telling the other.

57:14.556 --> 57:16.433
The other one loved
his buddy's idea,

57:16.516 --> 57:19.144
and they was hugging
and listening to Cat Stevens.

57:21.272 --> 57:23.732
And they were naturally-tanned nuts.

57:23.815 --> 57:26.443
And I never took my nuts in the sun
'cause I'm with Christ,

57:26.526 --> 57:27.945
I don't do that kind of shit.

57:28.028 --> 57:30.364
Naturally tanned,
like angels came at night

57:30.447 --> 57:32.824
and just painted my nuts
with tanned paint,

57:32.908 --> 57:35.327
like the Sistine Nutsack.

57:37.413 --> 57:42.334
Now, my nuts look like somebody else
been using 'em when I'm not around.

57:42.418 --> 57:44.044
Like I got timeshare nuts.

57:44.128 --> 57:46.213
Like, "Who didn't take care of these?

57:46.297 --> 57:48.966
I bet it was the Thompsons,
check the log!"

57:51.593 --> 57:53.720
We're falling apart too, ladies.

57:53.804 --> 57:57.975
I gotta pinch my penis when I fart
so it doesn't drip a little.

57:58.058 --> 58:01.937
And that ain't a disease I have,
that's every man in here

58:02.020 --> 58:03.981
over the age of thirty.

58:04.064 --> 58:06.358
When you see your husband
in the hallway like this,

58:06.442 --> 58:09.903
you're like, "Are you having a stroke?"
He's like, "I'm trying to fart!"

58:13.449 --> 58:15.492
We're falling apart too, man.

58:15.575 --> 58:18.662
I shit myself last year.
I'll tell you about it, bro.

58:18.745 --> 58:20.664
I ain't above nothing.

58:20.747 --> 58:23.459
I shit myself last year.
I was driving my car,

58:23.541 --> 58:26.837
and I wasn't driving to a fancy,
shit-yourself meet-up group.

58:26.920 --> 58:30.382
I was just driving,
and I reached to put the window down,

58:30.466 --> 58:34.386
and I don't know what button I hit,
but I shit myself.

58:34.470 --> 58:38.140
'Cause you can't trust
a fart after 29, that's why.

58:38.223 --> 58:42.311
I used to be young and fart with both
my eyes open like a ass gangster.

58:42.394 --> 58:45.563
[Blowing air]

58:45.689 --> 58:48.484
Now, I gotta keep one eye closed.

58:48.566 --> 58:50.568
Keeping watch on the inside.

58:53.364 --> 58:56.908
'Cause you will shit
your sweet Christian self.

58:59.744 --> 59:03.915
I look more forward to the fart after sex
than I do to sex itself.

59:03.999 --> 59:06.960
I was dating this gal for a while,
and she had a little cat,

59:07.044 --> 59:10.172
would be always in the kitchen
waiting for free meats and shit.

59:10.255 --> 59:11.673
Little Democat.

59:12.341 --> 59:15.469
And I'd be back in the room,
just going at it,

59:15.552 --> 59:18.680
like two trains trying to pass
each other on the same track,

59:18.763 --> 59:20.765
but the whole time I'm thinking,
"When I get done,

59:20.849 --> 59:23.643
I'm-a go in the kitchen
and fart on that cat.

59:23.727 --> 59:26.938
That's the pussy that's really gonna
get it here tonight.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.275
That little asshole."

59:31.026 --> 59:34.321
We're falling apart too, ladies.
Put down the dumbbells.

59:34.405 --> 59:36.614
Pick up some flowers, look lost.

59:39.117 --> 59:40.327
It'll all work out.

59:42.329 --> 59:44.456
'Cause I think I want to have a child.

59:44.540 --> 59:46.750
You got any child?
What you got?

59:46.833 --> 59:49.253
[Man] A little girl, and one in the oven.

59:49.336 --> 59:52.297
You got one in the oven, huh?
Hell, yeah, boy, get in there.

59:55.551 --> 59:57.344
I'm thinking of having a child.

59:57.428 --> 01:00:01.432
I gotta get a girlfriend first, but...
I think I want a child.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:04.226
I just want something
to be at home when I'm not there.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:12.025
But a lot of these kids are
bitches these days, man, you know?

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:14.445
Name seven kids that aren't bitches, bro.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.364
Yeah, nobody can.

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:19.908
If they had a tall box right here
with a kid in it,

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:23.579
I'd be like, "What's in here?
A little bitch, that's what."

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:27.332
'Cause they got it too easy man.
These kids have no struggle.

01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:31.420
We had struggle,
these kids have vaccinations. Come on.

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:33.922
When I was young,
you caught what you caught.

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:35.424
Everybody had something.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:39.052
Rubella, lockjaw, we all
had a little bit of polio, remember?

01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:43.599
I had a friend who had a fuckin' arm
growing out of his back, Larry Armback.

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:46.726
Got a great job as a crossing guard.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:50.355
He could have been an Olympic swimmer,
but he had a skin condition.

01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:53.150
He was black. So...

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:55.569
Oh, whatever, dude.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:59.323
You can put 20 arms on a brother,
he ain't gonna wanna get in the deep end.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:06.371
Kids are calling the cops
on their parents, man.

01:01:06.455 --> 01:01:09.874
What? Back in the day
if you called the cops on your parents,

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:12.169
the cops would
get your parents on the phone

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:15.422
and tell your parents to beat yo' ass.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:24.889
My mother used to whoop my ass.
I didn't think she lived with us.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:30.562
She whooped me so bad one time,
I couldn't put clothes on my skin.

01:01:30.646 --> 01:01:34.441
My buddy's like, "You're naked!"
I'm like, "But I'm behavin'!

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:38.278
This is my behavior outfit.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:39.988
Now quit lookin' at my dick."

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.870
What if I have a dumb kid?
I worry about that.

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:49.080
I fucked some dumb girls, man.

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:52.626
One of them hatches something,
now I got to raise that.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:56.421
I can't imagine my whole life just hugging
some kid, pretending he ain't dumb,

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:58.048
and knowing he's dumb.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.967
Like, "Aw, everything's gonna be fine,
man."

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:06.348
That's got to be the worst, man.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:08.933
We shouldn't let dumb people
have kids, man.

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.768
We wouldn't have that problem.

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:14.189
If you don't graduate high school,
you shouldn't get to have a kid.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:17.942
How you gonna raise a kid?
You couldn't raise a "F" to a "D."

01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:24.157
The problem is we circumcise
the wrong part of the boy.

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:27.952
We keep slipping off the turtleneck,
we need to take the nuts.

01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:30.664
Give 'em back to him
when he graduates high school.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.875
"Congratulations, ladies and gentlemen,
it's a wonderful day.

01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:36.461
Ladies, move your tassels
from left to the right.

01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:38.213
Men, you can pick your tassels up

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:41.299
from that cardboard box
on the way out of the auditorium."

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:47.264
Some of you ladies need to quit having
eight kids

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:49.182
before we know
what your first kid is like.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:52.227
You see a woman got seven kids
all under the age of five.

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:54.563
Like, "How did you even fuckin' do that?

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:56.773
You ain't a woman, you a wizard."

01:02:57.857 --> 01:02:59.817
From now on, you get one kid.

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:01.528
We check on his ass at six.

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:04.114
If he ain't shit, you don't get
any more fuckin' kids.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.783
Why? 'Cause the first one ain't shit.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:12.080
Sick of this bullshit
in this country, man.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.666
Sick of it, bro.
We gotta get rid of some people.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:17.544
I don't know if I want
to bring a child into this world.

01:03:17.628 --> 01:03:19.713
There's some straight creeps
out there, dawg.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:21.839
Some straight lurkers.

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:25.843
If you're over the age of 30
and you still skateboard,

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.513
who the fuck are you, dude?

01:03:28.597 --> 01:03:30.766
Not Tony Hawk, that's who.

01:03:30.848 --> 01:03:33.810
Jacking up my insurance premiums, sir.

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.563
Now get the fuck out.

01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:40.358
If you wear camouflage but you ain't
in the woods or in the military,

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:41.859
who you hiding from?

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:44.988
From looking decent, that's who.

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:48.241
Operation Desert Dumb Ass.
Now put on an acceptable pattern,

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.909
or get the fuck out.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:54.414
If you wear sunglasses
while you work out at the gym,

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:57.125
are you serious?

01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:00.796
You look like a blind person
that's good at shit.

01:04:00.878 --> 01:04:04.048
Only two men ever looked good
in sweat and sunglasses,

01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:07.427
that's Fidel Castro
and the late Macho Man Randy Savage.

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:11.723
So why don't you snap into a slim piece
of advice and get the fuck out?

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:14.643
If you sleep with the TV on,

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:18.021
and wonder why you have
attention deficit disorder.

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:21.441
I don't know, probably because
you sleep with the TV on!

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:24.319
Shut it off and get some shut-eye
or get out.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:32.369
Asian people who are driving,
no more driving.

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:36.289
I know it's cliché,
but the trial period has to be over, man.

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:38.375
They can't drive, dude.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:41.503
No more driving, okay?

01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:45.423
I don't Cirque du Soleil
'cause I can't Cirque du Soleil.

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:48.259
We shouldn't just be doing shit
just because.

01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:52.930
So park it, Asians, and invent
the hoverboard I know you know how to make

01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:55.099
'cause I can see it in your eyes...

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:57.185
or get the fuck out!

01:04:57.728 --> 01:05:01.356
Thick people that's hoggin'
all the wheelchairs at the airport.

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:05.861
And I ain't sayin' it's sistas,
but I ain't sayin' it ain't.

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:10.073
Disabled Staff Sergent So-and-So,
who lost his legs in Afghanistan,

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:12.409
gotta elbow-crawl to make his connection

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.911
'cause Mama Bear
is hogging all the assistance.

01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:18.498
Park it and walk if off, Loqshwanda,
or get out. Okay?

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.042
Persian people.

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:23.461
Get out, bro.

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:29.133
Nobody likes you guys, man.
Sorry to be the messenger.

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:32.262
If you guys were offended
by anything I said tonight,

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:33.971
get the fuck out, son!

01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:37.225
I'm Theo Von, thank you guys very much
for comin' out tonight.

01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:38.852
[Applause]

01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:40.729
Thank you.

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:44.482
Thank you very much.

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:45.901
[Rap music]

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:51.989
[Theo] Thank you!
