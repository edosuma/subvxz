01:04.565 --> 01:07.151
Get down! Get down now!

01:07.348 --> 01:09.832
I'm not kidding, buddy! Down!

01:14.326 --> 01:16.283
That's far enough, citizen.

01:16.782 --> 01:19.308
- Who the hell are you?
- The Adjuster.

01:19.472 --> 01:21.964
And you're about to be adjusted!

01:37.597 --> 01:39.296
Let that be a lesson, you fiends.

01:39.331 --> 01:42.535
The streets of Old City are
no longer safe for your kind.

01:47.664 --> 01:49.931
When crime's around...

01:50.533 --> 01:52.377
I'll be found!

01:57.329 --> 01:59.797
- Let's go.
- No, no!

02:04.897 --> 02:06.993
What in the hell was that?

02:08.431 --> 02:11.473
Mate, I have no idea.

02:49.879 --> 02:52.548
Here is my favorite part.

02:52.583 --> 02:56.063
You know, I'm so pleased
that my pain amuses you.

02:56.098 --> 02:58.845
God, look at the whiplash on that baby!

02:59.883 --> 03:01.481
I'm checking for broken bones.

03:01.516 --> 03:04.015
Yeah, well, if you press
any harder, you'll find some.

03:06.516 --> 03:09.180
How does he manage to fly
like that without wings?

03:09.250 --> 03:11.665
I've never seen an abnormal
with that ability before.

03:11.700 --> 03:16.198
Yeah, you know, I thought the same thing
when my head bounced off the ground.

03:17.122 --> 03:19.628
- How is the shoulder?
- Nothing I can't handle.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.881
Not exactly the welcome I had in mind,

03:21.916 --> 03:23.662
when you volunteered to come aboard.

03:23.697 --> 03:25.509
I'm sorry the guy we chased got away.

03:25.638 --> 03:28.226
He's an empath trying to
break free from the mob.

03:28.261 --> 03:29.980
If he's smart, he'll come to us.

03:30.015 --> 03:32.580
As for the flying man, I'm
having Henry look into it.

03:32.615 --> 03:35.198
Keep me posted. I'm dying for a rematch.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.936
Well, if anyone needs me,
I'll be coughing up blood.

03:38.971 --> 03:42.025
Actually, I need you. Get Dressed.

03:48.183 --> 03:50.689
Happened around 8:00 am.

03:50.724 --> 03:54.125
The staff was digging out a
corner when the wall gave way.

03:55.817 --> 03:57.753
They found.... this.

03:58.489 --> 04:00.523
I called the city inspector right away.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.925
He took one look at it and called you.

04:05.283 --> 04:07.281
So...

04:07.316 --> 04:09.661
You guys are archaeologists or something?

04:11.083 --> 04:14.368
Would you mind rounding up the rest of
the crew that were here at the time?

04:14.466 --> 04:16.350
I'd like to speak with them.

04:17.012 --> 04:20.372
- Ok. Sure. I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

04:22.091 --> 04:24.808
Ever seen anything like this before?

04:24.843 --> 04:28.389
No, but whatever it is,
it hatched recently.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.834
These are like claw marks.

04:34.342 --> 04:38.318
You think something dug this hole,
laid the egg, and then just left it?

04:39.416 --> 04:41.145
But it would have to had occur years ago,

04:41.180 --> 04:43.078
before the city was built.

04:43.349 --> 04:45.923
It's difficult to imagine
something surviving that long.

04:45.958 --> 04:47.594
Not impossible.

04:47.922 --> 04:51.004
The real question is:
why did it hatch now?

04:51.777 --> 04:55.440
This room was probably the vacuum
before the workers broke through.

04:55.550 --> 04:58.036
Maybe the introduction of air
kick-started the process?

05:00.450 --> 05:03.170
The men are outside. Except Joe.

05:03.949 --> 05:05.248
Joe?

05:05.283 --> 05:07.755
The backhoe operator.
First guy on the scene.

05:07.790 --> 05:10.227
He left, said he was not
feeling well or something.

05:19.583 --> 05:22.941
Joseph Koster, 38, divorced.

05:23.047 --> 05:24.789
No sign of any abnormal behavior.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.895
I take it you tried to
get in contact with him?

05:26.930 --> 05:30.257
He's not answering his phone.
He's not at his place, either.

05:30.667 --> 05:33.025
- Try putting out word to our contacts.
- I already did.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.717
Squid gave us a tip. There's some guy
matching this description

05:35.752 --> 05:39.037
acting very weird on the
top floor of Saint Canare Place.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.817
Saint Canare?
That's a condemned building.

05:40.852 --> 05:43.826
Yeah, I know it's a long shot, but Declan
and I figured we had to check it out.

05:43.879 --> 05:45.396
Absolutely, but be careful.

05:45.431 --> 05:48.365
We have no idea what effect this
creature could have had on Mr. Koster.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.681
Any idea what is or was?

05:50.973 --> 05:55.728
The shell membrane would seem to
indicate something reptilian, but...

05:56.192 --> 05:59.709
the amniotic fluid is definitely
consistent with that of an insect.

06:01.157 --> 06:03.667
I'll.... Just read the report.

06:07.317 --> 06:10.090
River Banshee. Fire Shrimp.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.606
Word of advice? Wear gloves.

06:13.444 --> 06:15.460
Shouldn't you be writing this
down or something?

06:15.495 --> 06:16.846
What for?

06:16.881 --> 06:18.985
In case you need to
fill in for me one day.

06:19.020 --> 06:21.434
Yeah, right.... Hey!

06:21.616 --> 06:24.356
- Hey, what's in here?
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

06:24.442 --> 06:26.249
Why not?

06:27.734 --> 06:29.812
Told ya.

06:35.254 --> 06:37.782
That sound generally means
you should answer it.

06:42.483 --> 06:43.814
Yeah?

06:43.849 --> 06:47.276
Hey, it's me. I need to see you.

06:47.734 --> 06:50.930
- I'll call you back.
- Everything okay?

06:52.650 --> 06:54.584
Yeah I gotta go.

07:03.948 --> 07:06.929
What's a guy like Joe
doing in a place like this?

07:08.067 --> 07:09.884
No idea.

07:18.464 --> 07:21.563
- He was definitely here though.
- Hey, Zimmerman...

07:22.849 --> 07:24.746
You hungry?

07:26.102 --> 07:27.996
Not anymore.

07:28.443 --> 07:30.561
Got to be kidding me.

07:30.596 --> 07:33.817
Likes chowing down on cats?

07:40.837 --> 07:42.541
Have you found anything, Henry?

07:42.576 --> 07:45.097
Looks like our mystery
super-hero has been busy.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.515
Doing what exactly?

07:46.550 --> 07:49.274
Everything, it seems. Foiling robberies
beating up bad-guys

07:49.309 --> 07:51.528
but the best is this. Wait.

07:51.563 --> 07:53.636
- What we are we looking at?
- Video of a jumper

07:53.671 --> 07:56.583
taken yesterday. Here, check it out.

07:58.883 --> 08:00.636
Unbelievable.

08:00.942 --> 08:03.254
Yeah, except the guy ended up
with 4 crushed vertebrae

08:03.289 --> 08:05.152
from the force of the catch.

08:05.883 --> 08:08.938
Any information on how we
can find this flying man?

08:08.973 --> 08:11.096
So far he has done a really good job
keeping his secret identity a secret.

08:11.131 --> 08:12.950
Well, we need to track him down.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.870
For one thing, he's getting
in the way of our work.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.080
For another, if he keeps this up,
a lot of people are

08:18.080 --> 08:19.570
going to get seriously hurt.

08:19.753 --> 08:22.114
Well, I don't know if it helps, but
eyewitness reports say that

08:22.149 --> 08:25.571
he arrives on the scene right away,
sometimes before the police.

08:27.016 --> 08:29.779
Do you think he has some kind of ESP?

08:31.727 --> 08:33.916
Oh, Henry...

08:37.419 --> 08:38.712
Where...

08:38.748 --> 08:42.216
Where crime is found,
I'll be around.

08:42.251 --> 08:43.515
No.

08:43.549 --> 08:47.149
Where crime is seen,
I will be on the scene.

08:48.249 --> 08:51.882
Where the crime is plotted,

08:51.917 --> 08:53.666
I'll be...

08:53.701 --> 08:55.416
spotted?

08:55.451 --> 08:56.881
Damn!

08:56.916 --> 09:01.368
<i>All units available,we have
a 10-36 in progress at 820 Orchid.</i>

09:01.403 --> 09:03.692
<i>Three suspects. Shots fired.</i>

09:04.116 --> 09:06.305
<i>All units, 820 Orchid...</i>

09:12.035 --> 09:14.016
Right.

09:41.591 --> 09:43.316
<i>Hello.</i>

09:46.316 --> 09:49.185
- Who are you?
- My name is Helen Magnus,

09:49.220 --> 09:51.313
and we need to talk.

09:51.513 --> 09:54.063
You tricked me. This is a trap.

09:54.098 --> 09:57.131
Yes, but if you'll just listen.

09:57.699 --> 09:59.793
I knew sooner or later my
activities would attract

09:59.828 --> 10:01.461
the wrong kind of people,

10:01.496 --> 10:04.691
but you're gonna have to do
a lot better than that to bring me down.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.750
Nice shot.

10:18.853 --> 10:22.350
Well... he's kind of hard to miss.

10:24.622 --> 10:26.887
You will never get away with this.

10:26.922 --> 10:29.490
You think that these puny
restraints can hold me?

10:32.590 --> 10:34.622
How's he doing?

10:35.113 --> 10:37.133
He's still convinced
we're super-villains,

10:37.134 --> 10:40.560
who have kidnapped him
to conduct experiments.

10:40.910 --> 10:44.261
- What did you find out?
- Well, his suit looks homemade

10:44.296 --> 10:47.613
but it seems to be some sort of
high grade kevlar type material.

10:47.614 --> 10:50.242
I had to draw blood from
between his fingers.

10:50.243 --> 10:52.622
- And?
- See for yourself.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.856
- He's not abnormal?
- Not according to his DNA.

10:58.922 --> 11:01.716
But how is thait possible?
The guy was flying.

11:01.717 --> 11:04.305
I can't explain, but it does mean
that we're going to have to do

11:04.306 --> 11:06.316
a far more detailed exam.

11:07.356 --> 11:09.670
Well, that doesn't
bode well for our whole

11:09.756 --> 11:11.817
"We're not super-villains" case.

11:11.818 --> 11:15.287
Try to avoid the topic of
total global domination.

11:15.288 --> 11:17.782
Thanks.

11:19.856 --> 11:21.423
Kate.

11:23.139 --> 11:26.156
You have got a lot of nerve
calling me out of the blue like that.

11:26.191 --> 11:27.923
I haven't heard from you for months.

11:27.958 --> 11:29.655
Mom didn't even know where you were.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.056
It's good to see you, too.

11:33.089 --> 11:35.177
When did you get here?

11:35.178 --> 11:37.121
- Couple days ago.
- A couple days?

11:37.156 --> 11:40.855
Oh, easy all right? I meant to call

11:40.856 --> 11:42.620
I just.... I got tied up.

11:42.655 --> 11:45.856
- With what?
- I need a favor.

11:47.523 --> 11:48.821
Oh no... 

11:48.856 --> 11:51.251
No, Tad, I thought you were
going to give that up.

11:51.286 --> 11:53.641
I did. I've been straight for six months.

11:53.642 --> 11:55.072
- Right...
- I swear!

11:55.107 --> 11:56.920
So what happened?

11:56.921 --> 11:58.488
I slipped.

11:58.523 --> 12:00.349
I mean, these guys
pulled me into a game.

12:00.350 --> 12:01.987
How much?

12:02.022 --> 12:05.226
It's not the "how much" it's the "who to."

12:05.756 --> 12:08.253
A guy named Constantine?

12:10.296 --> 12:14.167
- You know him.
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:14.168 --> 12:17.810
Kate, you gotta believe me.
I never meant for any of this to happen.

12:17.913 --> 12:20.528
I met this girl. We were
going to California...

12:20.529 --> 12:22.500
Save it.

12:23.567 --> 12:27.639
Kate, I just need to get clear of this.

12:29.856 --> 12:31.889
Please.

12:33.789 --> 12:36.223
Now is my chance.

12:38.256 --> 12:39.854
So...

12:39.889 --> 12:42.590
Come to face me at last, huh?

12:42.625 --> 12:44.356
Who are you people anyway?

12:44.447 --> 12:46.889
Hydra? League of Assassins?

12:46.924 --> 12:49.100
Circus of Crime?

12:49.786 --> 12:51.945
I just want to talk to you, Walter.

12:53.123 --> 12:55.266
How did you know my name?

12:55.267 --> 12:57.335
Your DNA match some
hospital records

12:57.336 --> 12:58.878
we had in our database.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.783
It says here you worked
as a claims adjuster?

13:00.784 --> 13:02.523
Yeah, well, that was before.

13:02.524 --> 13:04.330
Now I'm just...

13:04.331 --> 13:06.400
"The Adjuster."

13:06.424 --> 13:08.490
Right...

13:08.525 --> 13:10.521
Right.

13:10.556 --> 13:13.845
Yesterday afternoon you had a run-in
with some guys on some motorbikes...

13:13.846 --> 13:16.316
- Who told you that?
- I was one of those guys.

13:16.351 --> 13:18.786
We were trying to catch
the guy that you...

13:18.787 --> 13:20.614
- Saved.
- Yeah.

13:20.615 --> 13:22.435
That's pretty much why I saved him.

13:22.470 --> 13:24.221
Right, but what you don't realize

13:24.256 --> 13:26.822
is that we were
actually trying to help him.

13:26.857 --> 13:28.687
See, we are not
the bad guys here, Walter,

13:28.722 --> 13:30.590
but there are some bad people
who are after him.

13:30.591 --> 13:32.685
Why?

13:35.404 --> 13:38.982
- He's an empath.
- Like Psylocke.

13:40.655 --> 13:42.686
From X-Men?

13:43.223 --> 13:46.290
She was killed by Vargas and
later resurrected without her tattoo.

13:46.291 --> 13:49.696
Yes, just like Psylocke.

13:49.697 --> 13:52.059
Seriously...

13:52.094 --> 13:54.422
Who are you guys?

13:54.889 --> 13:56.787
We'll get to that,

13:56.822 --> 13:59.830
but first, why don't you tell me
how you got these powers?

13:59.831 --> 14:01.789
Never.

14:03.922 --> 14:06.121
What are you working on?

14:06.156 --> 14:07.687
DNA tests on the eggshell

14:07.722 --> 14:11.820
didn't yield anything substantial,
but when Will told me,

14:11.822 --> 14:13.300
about the cat remains that he found,

14:13.301 --> 14:16.692
it reminded me of encounter my father
had with another abnormal.

14:17.989 --> 14:19.787
Coleanthropus.

14:19.822 --> 14:23.088
It was discovered by
U.S. federal troops in 1892,

14:23.123 --> 14:26.056
when they were trying to quell
a miners' uprising in Idaho.

14:26.091 --> 14:28.271
What makes you think
it's the same abnormal?

14:30.135 --> 14:31.784
According to reports,

14:31.785 --> 14:34.242
the soldiers found an egg
inside the mine.

14:34.277 --> 14:38.089
It hatched, and the creature went inside
the body of one of the soldiers.

14:38.299 --> 14:40.787
The victim ran away,
but shortly thereafter,

14:40.822 --> 14:43.021
the others found the carcasses
of several small animals.

14:43.056 --> 14:46.056
It says here the creature attacked
again the following evening,

14:46.091 --> 14:48.021
but its appearance had changed.

14:48.056 --> 14:50.089
It was no longer inside
the body of the soldier.

14:50.124 --> 14:52.121
My father suspected that it had evolved

14:52.156 --> 14:54.590
to a further stage its life cycle.

14:54.591 --> 14:57.162
Unfortunately, by the time he got there,
the creature was long gone

14:57.189 --> 14:59.189
and most of the survivors had fled.

14:59.581 --> 15:02.088
- Not much to go on.
- No.

15:02.089 --> 15:04.108
However, all the eyewitnesses

15:04.143 --> 15:06.021
spoke of the creature's
high pitched shriek,

15:06.056 --> 15:09.152
said it was unlike anything
they had ever heard before.

15:09.679 --> 15:12.850
Perhaps we can use that
to our advantage.

15:16.022 --> 15:18.292
- You sure this is going to work?
- Absolutely.

15:18.301 --> 15:20.495
We've tapped into the city's
terrorism suppression grid.

15:20.530 --> 15:22.626
If your monster makes
any noise above 90 decibels,

15:22.661 --> 15:24.922
- We'll know about it.
- Excellent work, Henry.

15:24.957 --> 15:26.137
Thank you.

15:26.172 --> 15:28.737
Now, I've calibrated it to detect
high-frequency sounds.

15:28.772 --> 15:31.363
So don't go getting too close
to any ambulances,

15:31.364 --> 15:33.193
or Christina Aguilera.

15:33.228 --> 15:35.428
No worries about that, mate.

15:42.237 --> 15:44.056
Hey, how's it going with super-dude?

15:44.091 --> 15:45.554
Oh, pretty good.

15:45.589 --> 15:47.666
I managed to convince him that
are not evil. So, that's something.

15:47.701 --> 15:51.361
- The big guy is checking him out now.
- Did he say how he was able to fly?

15:51.545 --> 15:54.209
Yes, three weeks ago he
was hanging out on a friend's yacht

15:54.210 --> 15:56.856
off the coast of Africa when
they got attacked by pirates

15:56.891 --> 15:59.687
called the "Singh Brotherhood".

15:59.722 --> 16:02.413
Somehow in the middle of it all
he got pushed over the side

16:02.514 --> 16:05.288
and he swam to shore,
and he found a cave,

16:05.323 --> 16:09.223
and the cave there was this temple,
and in the temple there was this ruby

16:09.258 --> 16:11.655
called the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak.
Yeah.

16:12.677 --> 16:15.755
- How did you know that?
- This guy is good.

16:16.596 --> 16:18.852
What are you talking about?

16:18.853 --> 16:21.561
For real? You never read
comic books as a kid?

16:22.179 --> 16:24.823
I mean, yes.... I was
more of a Sherlock Holmes guy.

16:24.824 --> 16:26.134
Why?

16:26.135 --> 16:27.724
Okay, the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak?

16:27.725 --> 16:30.456
That's the stone Cain Marko
found in the X-Men number 12.

16:30.491 --> 16:32.003
Turned him into Juggernaut.

16:32.038 --> 16:34.009
The Singh Brotherhood is
the Phantom, and the yacht,

16:34.010 --> 16:36.026
well, if you don't know
the story the Green Arrow,

16:36.027 --> 16:38.322
then there's hope for you, pal.

16:38.357 --> 16:41.750
- Dude, you got played.
- Crap.

16:51.156 --> 16:52.589
What happened?

16:52.590 --> 16:55.989
Super-guy was in the scanner.
I turned my back for a second...

16:56.024 --> 16:58.323
- Which way did he go?
- Away.

16:58.358 --> 17:01.054
- Come on.
- Okay.

17:01.089 --> 17:04.713
You go to the residences,
I'll check the foyer.

17:05.388 --> 17:09.388
What.... he couldn't use the door?

17:13.809 --> 17:16.123
<i>- You call that tea?
- Declan, it's Will.</i>

17:16.157 --> 17:18.657
<i>- Anything?
- No, nothing yet.</i>

17:18.693 --> 17:21.159
Although there was a faint...

17:21.490 --> 17:24.289
Stand by. We got something.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.423
Is that Joe?

17:36.152 --> 17:38.289
Bloody hell.

17:46.183 --> 17:49.523
Alright, fella, out you come.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.524
Take it down!

18:03.080 --> 18:04.917
Get him!

18:07.723 --> 18:10.356
Where's a bloody flying man
when you need him?

18:12.030 --> 18:13.563
Well it's a lot bigger than a man now.

18:13.598 --> 18:16.197
Yeah, the file was right.
The creature evolved.

18:16.232 --> 18:17.895
Yeah, if you can call it that.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.164
Good news is that Henry's
sonic scanner worked.

18:20.199 --> 18:21.930
We should be able track it.

18:21.965 --> 18:24.131
- You know...
- What?

18:24.459 --> 18:27.130
Magnus said that the amniotic
residue inside the egg

18:27.131 --> 18:30.364
- Was similar to that of an insect.
- Okay.

18:30.399 --> 18:32.363
Well, we've already seen three stages,

18:32.398 --> 18:35.660
the egg, Joe, and that
creature that attacked you.

18:35.695 --> 18:37.497
You think you there might be
a fourth stage.

18:37.498 --> 18:38.852
Well, it makes sense, doesn't it?

18:38.887 --> 18:41.464
I mean, maybe it's looking
for a place to cocoon.

18:41.499 --> 18:43.364
It also means it might go quiet on us.

18:43.870 --> 18:46.400
- We'll have to work fast.
- Alright, let's split up

18:46.401 --> 18:49.431
and sweep the area.
Signal if you find anything.

18:49.466 --> 18:51.498
Team two with Will.

18:51.828 --> 18:54.598
Were you able to transfer the data
from Walter's medical scan?

18:54.633 --> 18:57.097
Yeah, but it's no use.
Walter corrupted it.

18:57.534 --> 19:00.664
- Walter?
- "The Savage Seven", issue 319.

19:00.699 --> 19:02.463
- What?
- Dustin Blake is captured

19:02.498 --> 19:04.263
by a group called "The Sentinels".

19:04.264 --> 19:06.631
The perform experiments on him.
He wipes their computer clean

19:06.666 --> 19:09.197
while he escapes so they can't...

19:10.664 --> 19:12.214
Track him.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.698
I been trying to recompile the image
using raw data.

19:17.733 --> 19:19.151
I don't think we're going
to find anything,

19:19.151 --> 19:21.151
Walter wasn't in there for very long.

19:21.186 --> 19:24.903
- Well, let's see.
- Yeah. Right there. See?

19:24.904 --> 19:26.585
That's what I was afraid of.
There's a shadow.

19:26.586 --> 19:28.603
- Do you mind?
- Be my guest.

19:28.604 --> 19:30.254
I'm just going to magnify the image.

19:30.298 --> 19:34.769
You can magnify away, Doc,
but I don't think you're gonna find...

19:34.997 --> 19:37.163
What the hell is that?

19:37.164 --> 19:40.098
That is Walter's suit.

19:40.564 --> 19:42.989
Walter suit is made of bugs?

19:42.990 --> 19:45.846
Billions of them.
It makes perfect sense.

19:45.847 --> 19:47.796
Walter isn't an abnormal,
he's wearing one

19:47.831 --> 19:50.943
and I'll wager it's what's
giving him his special abilities.

19:50.944 --> 19:52.440
The bugs?

19:52.441 --> 19:54.085
Think of them more as a collective

19:54.120 --> 19:56.802
rather than individual beings, and yes,

19:57.403 --> 19:59.628
I believe they are what's
allowing him to fly.

19:59.629 --> 20:01.425
- How?
- I'm not sure.

20:01.791 --> 20:03.831
I mean he must be
controlling them somehow.

20:04.753 --> 20:09.067
I need to take another
look at his blood work.

20:11.297 --> 20:14.164
Hey, boys, I've got
something for Constantine.

20:20.531 --> 20:23.431
Who wants a sentient fungus?
This is not what we agreed.

20:23.500 --> 20:27.369
I have to tell you,
I don't like surprises.

20:29.798 --> 20:31.205
Katie Freelander.

20:31.698 --> 20:35.255
- As I live and breathe.
- You know why I'm here.

20:35.370 --> 20:38.848
Of course. Your brother's debt.
What terrible luck he has.

20:40.177 --> 20:41.564
What's this?

20:41.566 --> 20:44.446
Payment. In full with interest.

20:54.195 --> 20:56.429
A Steno tusk.

20:56.431 --> 20:58.231
I thought they were extinct.

20:58.235 --> 21:00.695
Well, just gotta know
where to look, I guess.

21:00.698 --> 21:03.231
That more than covers his debt.

21:03.266 --> 21:05.765
So don't try pretend that it doesn't.

21:08.030 --> 21:10.245
You know, this selfless
act of yours is touching,

21:10.246 --> 21:12.134
but I don't want your money.

21:12.398 --> 21:13.764
Rumor has it,

21:13.765 --> 21:16.697
that you have found
a comfy place to sleep,

21:16.698 --> 21:19.464
at the Sanctuary!

21:20.698 --> 21:22.364
Where did you hear that?

21:22.664 --> 21:26.252
Around. Hey, I don't judge.

21:26.334 --> 21:31.031
In fact, it makes you,
uniquely valuable to me.

21:31.831 --> 21:33.452
What are you talking about?

21:33.487 --> 21:35.663
I don't mind telling you
that the Cabal's demise

21:35.664 --> 21:38.499
has opened up quite a few
opportunities for me.

21:38.980 --> 21:42.165
There is a huge demand
for abnormals out there.

21:42.168 --> 21:45.405
A demand I find myself
unable to fill.

21:46.231 --> 21:47.565
However,

21:47.865 --> 21:50.595
with an ally inside the Sanctuary...

21:50.598 --> 21:53.431
- Whoa, whoa, wait a second, an ally?
- Why not?

21:53.498 --> 21:56.581
You're just staying there.
You're not "with" them.

21:58.464 --> 22:00.660
You used my brother to get to me.

22:00.664 --> 22:04.150
We used be such an
incredible team together.

22:04.164 --> 22:07.150
You and I. Don't you remember?

22:07.185 --> 22:09.596
I am not 21 anymore.

22:09.631 --> 22:12.413
And I'm not a two-bit banger
fencing counterfeit junk anymore.

22:12.431 --> 22:15.220
This is real.
I urge you to take it seriously.

22:15.255 --> 22:17.496
Those days are gone, Constantine.

22:17.531 --> 22:19.531
You know, it was a really,
really nice offer

22:19.566 --> 22:21.631
but I'm not interested.

22:23.197 --> 22:25.164
Don't contact me again.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.371
Well, we searched the entire area.

22:30.406 --> 22:32.179
- Not a trace.
- Damn it.

22:32.498 --> 22:35.264
That thing could be anywhere now.

22:47.865 --> 22:49.798
Are you sure this is the right sample?

22:49.833 --> 22:52.049
Absolutely, why? What's the problem?

22:52.631 --> 22:56.221
His CPK3 and creatinine levels
are through the roof.

22:56.331 --> 22:57.629
So what does that mean?

22:57.664 --> 23:01.038
It means we need to talk to Walter.
Right away.

23:04.160 --> 23:07.970
<i>All available units, we have a 411
in progress at 1310 Marine.</i>

23:07.970 --> 23:09.130
<i>Suspect is fleeing.</i>

23:09.264 --> 23:11.190
<i>All units available, please advise.</i>

23:15.498 --> 23:16.798
Right.

23:26.838 --> 23:30.638
What the.... how did I end up back here?

23:30.700 --> 23:32.590
You'd be amazed at
how much buzz it creates

23:32.600 --> 23:35.999
when a guy in a super-suit
falls off his balcony.

23:36.564 --> 23:38.728
Before you go knocking
another hole in my wall

23:38.898 --> 23:41.199
know this; you are free to leave
whenever you like.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.900
But you might want to hear
what we have to say first.

23:45.531 --> 23:48.031
Your suit's not really a suit,

23:48.464 --> 23:50.464
but you knew that already.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.365
What you may not know is that
it is actually a parasite,

23:53.431 --> 23:55.395
and it appears to be feeding on you.

23:55.398 --> 23:57.608
Your latest test results
show the signs of early organ failure.

23:57.609 --> 24:00.431
Your body is shutting down.

24:00.446 --> 24:02.531
No. You're lying.

24:03.407 --> 24:07.054
This is just another one of your
super-villain tricks.

24:07.865 --> 24:09.264
Really?

24:09.364 --> 24:11.097
How are you feeling?

24:11.297 --> 24:13.707
Do you have any dizziness
or shortness of breath?

24:14.964 --> 24:18.498
Walter, we need to get this
suit off you, immediately.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.650
But.... I can't.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.797
- Walter, this is a matter...
- No!

24:24.156 --> 24:26.056
You don't understand.

24:26.997 --> 24:28.897
I can't take it off.

24:30.030 --> 24:33.364
I'm telling you, I've
tried dozens of times.

24:33.365 --> 24:35.165
Nothing works.

24:35.464 --> 24:37.298
It's stuck.

24:42.331 --> 24:44.331
Which means I'm a dead man.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.246
What do you mean.... stuck?

24:47.247 --> 24:49.663
Stuck, glued, impossible to remove.

24:49.664 --> 24:53.158
- Hold on, so, you've been
wearing this suit since...

24:53.164 --> 24:54.758
- Since about 8 days ago, yes.

24:55.531 --> 24:58.064
Well, how have you managed to, you know...

24:58.099 --> 25:01.029
I have no idea.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.479
All I know is I feel
lighter after meals.

25:05.897 --> 25:07.947
How did you come by the suit
in the first place?

25:08.697 --> 25:11.197
We need the real story, Walter.

25:11.731 --> 25:13.031
Right, uh...

25:13.930 --> 25:16.650
Well, as I mentioned before, I used to
work for an insurance company.

25:16.664 --> 25:19.264
By the way, if you guys need
any kind of coverage...

25:19.398 --> 25:21.470
- We're good.
- Right.

25:22.030 --> 25:24.869
Well, every year the company
took us on a team building a retreat

25:24.870 --> 25:28.166
to this dude ranch in the mountains.

25:28.431 --> 25:30.778
I was leading this team through the forest,

25:30.779 --> 25:33.131
on a pretty cuthroat game
of "capture the flag"...

25:34.831 --> 25:36.029
Hello?

25:36.064 --> 25:37.364
Hello? Hello?

25:38.698 --> 25:39.998
Guys?

25:41.131 --> 25:42.498
Guys?

25:45.030 --> 25:48.030
I must have slipped down into
a sinkhole or something,

25:48.064 --> 25:51.994
because the next thing I knew,
I woke up in a cave covered in slime.

25:55.831 --> 25:57.331
What? What?

26:03.030 --> 26:07.005
The shorts and gloves I added myself.

26:09.131 --> 26:12.276
The chestplate I had from before.
Don't judge.

26:13.348 --> 26:16.151
When did you get your super-powers?

26:16.531 --> 26:19.474
That's the beauty. I already had them.

26:20.188 --> 26:23.480
All I had to do was think "fly" and I
popped out of the hole, just like that.

26:23.515 --> 26:26.077
Telepathic communication of course.

26:26.193 --> 26:29.240
The suit's living off you,
in exchange for giving you these powers.

26:29.275 --> 26:33.060
I soon realized that I had speed,

26:33.231 --> 26:35.031
super-strength,

26:35.997 --> 26:37.829
X-ray vision...

26:38.510 --> 26:40.765
it was like my greatest wish come true!

26:42.644 --> 26:44.064
Well...

26:44.164 --> 26:45.906
Be careful what you wish for.

26:45.941 --> 26:48.131
We'll help you get it off, Walter.

26:48.166 --> 26:49.431
Yeah...

26:52.831 --> 26:55.904
- We are all ready in here.
- Okay, here we go.

27:42.798 --> 27:44.164
Walter!

27:52.140 --> 27:54.364
- Hey. Did you manage to...
- It's taken care of.

27:54.831 --> 27:57.952
Thank God. Thank you. Thank you.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.267
This is the last time, do you hear me?

28:02.268 --> 28:04.664
Totally. This was a one time slip,
I promise.

28:06.298 --> 28:08.896
You should get out of town.
Take a cab to the bus station.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.388
- I don't need money...
- Just take it.

28:15.131 --> 28:17.497
- Good luck in Cali.
- Kate...

28:17.997 --> 28:21.390
Thank you for.... everything.

28:21.664 --> 28:23.979
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

28:27.131 --> 28:29.230
Don't tell mom, okay?

28:35.264 --> 28:36.964
Hey.
How's Walter doing?

28:37.500 --> 28:40.355
Uh, he's stable. How's things going with you?

28:42.231 --> 28:44.097
Take a look.

28:50.516 --> 28:52.516
- They're dead.
- I believe so.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.029
I was able to create a toxin

28:54.064 --> 28:57.267
that attacks the suit creatures'
specific DNA.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.559
- Well, that's.... good.
- Is it?

29:00.865 --> 29:03.496
I have no idea what kind of
impact this will have on Walter.

29:03.531 --> 29:06.702
At minimum, he'll be sick for weeks
as he undergoes treatment,

29:06.703 --> 29:09.629
and there's no guarantee
he'll ever fully recover.

29:09.631 --> 29:11.231
Not to mention we are killing an abnormal

29:11.266 --> 29:13.383
who exhibits untold abilities.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.500
The likes of which
I've never seen before.

29:15.897 --> 29:17.229
Well, we knew that going in.

29:17.264 --> 29:19.598
Yes, but our job is to be smarter.

29:19.633 --> 29:21.182
To come up with a brilliant clever way

29:21.217 --> 29:23.087
to save both human and abnormal.

29:23.122 --> 29:24.958
Right. But we don't have time for that.

29:24.993 --> 29:27.251
I mean, this thing is killing Walter.

29:28.231 --> 29:29.564
At least we're saving him.

29:31.131 --> 29:33.885
- I wanted it off, not kill it!
- Walter...

29:34.930 --> 29:36.230
Come on!

29:36.930 --> 29:39.030
It's my suit. You can't do this to me.

29:39.097 --> 29:40.947
You're gonna die, Walter.

29:40.982 --> 29:42.797
Do you realize that?

29:43.531 --> 29:45.331
I don't care.

29:46.747 --> 29:48.947
Do you realize what this suit
has done for me?

29:50.131 --> 29:53.331
My whole life I've been
scared to do anything.

29:53.366 --> 29:55.029
Not even hobbies.

29:55.064 --> 29:57.055
Do you realize how many people
die each year

29:57.090 --> 29:59.047
in Renaissance fairy renactments?

29:59.082 --> 30:01.164
The statistics would blow you away.

30:03.162 --> 30:06.686
But now thanks to this suit,

30:07.831 --> 30:11.014
I don't even worry about it.

30:11.049 --> 30:14.197
I fly around saving people.

30:14.232 --> 30:15.563
It's pretty incredible!

30:15.598 --> 30:17.162
I realize how exciting it must be

30:17.197 --> 30:19.531
but is it really worth
risking your life for?

30:19.566 --> 30:22.265
You risk your lives every day
doing what you do.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.697
Look, I may not have a lot of time...

30:28.264 --> 30:31.865
So I want to use it
for what I was meant to do.

30:31.900 --> 30:35.197
Not sit around on the
sidelines anymore.

30:35.232 --> 30:37.828
Magnus, it's Henry.
I heard from Declan.

30:37.831 --> 30:40.831
He tracked the coleanthropus
to Kennington row.

30:40.866 --> 30:43.330
Alright. Think about it. Please.

30:54.658 --> 30:56.688
Tell me you're at the bus station, Tad.

30:56.723 --> 30:58.765
You should have
accepted my offer, Katie.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.983
You son of a bitch, where is my brother?

31:01.018 --> 31:03.328
He's fine, for now.

31:03.398 --> 31:05.930
Look, this is between you
and me, Constantine, okay?

31:05.965 --> 31:07.885
- Let him go.
- No, it was

31:07.898 --> 31:10.797
until you forced me to
bring him back into it.

31:10.832 --> 31:12.997
Seems to be the only way
to get your attention.

31:13.032 --> 31:15.296
Now, I'm a fair man, Katie.

31:15.331 --> 31:16.944
You don't want to
work with me, that's fine,

31:16.944 --> 31:18.944
but there is something
that I need from you.

31:19.295 --> 31:23.651
Inside that Sanctuary there is
a very rare species of lizard.

31:24.367 --> 31:26.162
I believe he's called "Steve".

31:26.197 --> 31:29.765
My client is prepared to
pay handsomely for it.

31:30.540 --> 31:34.035
You get me that lizard, and I'll
release your brother debt-free.

31:34.730 --> 31:38.231
I think you'll find that
I'm being more than generous.

31:40.964 --> 31:43.714
Katie...

31:45.773 --> 31:47.989
Fine, but this is gonna burn me with them

31:48.197 --> 31:50.970
so I'm gonna need a piece of the action.
Plus, I don't transport.

31:51.005 --> 31:54.402
You supply the truck, bring
Tad and Steno tusk with you.

31:55.660 --> 31:57.765
I'll call you when it's safe.

32:03.188 --> 32:04.710
- Where is it?
- Far end.

32:04.730 --> 32:06.616
I've got a man on each exit,
two more keeping watch.

32:06.651 --> 32:09.047
Henry was able to modify
these for subsonic action.

32:09.082 --> 32:10.782
Hopefully it will
disorient the creature

32:10.782 --> 32:12.282
long enough and we can
get the upper hand.

32:31.831 --> 32:33.997
Declan, where are your men?

32:34.032 --> 32:36.765
I left them here.

32:41.796 --> 32:43.441
Blood.

32:53.629 --> 32:55.942
Uh, guys.

33:20.424 --> 33:22.124
Bring it down!

33:24.023 --> 33:26.123
Watch your ears, everyone!

33:26.158 --> 33:27.481
Spread out!

33:27.516 --> 33:30.774
To be honest, I'm still
just kinda playing with it.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.457
Okay, you want to try it on me?

33:32.492 --> 33:35.224
Sure...

33:36.551 --> 33:39.773
Where evil lurks, that's where I work.

33:41.490 --> 33:43.452
What it's no good?

33:44.190 --> 33:47.723
No, not bad, not bad,
just.... a little sing-songey.

33:47.758 --> 33:48.779
Right.

33:48.814 --> 33:50.590
Try something along the lines of, like,

33:50.625 --> 33:52.865
"It's time to.... " you know?

33:55.457 --> 33:58.808
- "Time to take out the trash."
- Right. Right.

33:58.843 --> 34:00.788
You know? Or like, uh...

34:00.823 --> 34:02.735
"Time to put the kids to bed."

34:02.770 --> 34:04.942
Henry, come in!

34:05.659 --> 34:07.898
One moment. Yes, go ahead.

34:11.324 --> 34:14.126
The stunners are not working!
We need large containment!

34:14.161 --> 34:16.022
Okay, I'll get there
as soon as I can.

34:16.056 --> 34:19.056
Hey, listen, Walter, man,
I'm gonna have to put you...

34:19.092 --> 34:21.424
Crap!

34:49.324 --> 34:51.224
Did we kill it?

34:52.324 --> 34:54.255
I'm thinking we just pissed it off.

34:55.357 --> 34:58.142
I got him! Coming at you!

35:15.590 --> 35:17.022
Okay.

35:17.057 --> 35:18.623
Easy, boy...

35:18.658 --> 35:20.190
Easy now...

35:21.923 --> 35:23.506
Take it easy.

35:23.541 --> 35:25.055
What, this thing?

35:25.938 --> 35:27.787
It doesn't work anyway.

35:31.490 --> 35:32.890
Walter?

35:36.317 --> 35:39.306
Come on! You like that?

35:40.590 --> 35:42.956
Okay, everyone's out,
but we don't have much time.

35:46.624 --> 35:49.381
This is more impressive that I imagined.

35:49.610 --> 35:52.284
This isn't a tour. Keep up.

36:09.691 --> 36:11.391
Oh my God!

36:27.157 --> 36:30.687
Will you quit gawking?
We don't have a lot of time.

36:31.090 --> 36:35.038
You're lucky they all got called out
to fight some insecto-freak.

36:35.492 --> 36:38.590
Your lizard is over here.

36:56.006 --> 36:59.500
- I can't see anything.
- Just tap on the glass.

37:04.577 --> 37:06.291
What the...

37:15.132 --> 37:17.035
Drop it.

37:18.826 --> 37:20.275
Please...

37:22.057 --> 37:24.724
Unless you want to see
your autopsy before you die,

37:24.759 --> 37:26.790
I suggest you get
the hell out of here.

37:28.090 --> 37:31.680
And spread the word: Kate
Freelander is not for sale.

37:42.590 --> 37:44.340
Wait, what is this place?

37:44.375 --> 37:45.624
I've got to get you
to the bus station.

37:45.659 --> 37:49.595
But how...
would you have really done it?

37:49.630 --> 37:52.823
- Would you have killed that guy?
- Absolutely.

37:53.730 --> 37:54.450
Wow!

37:54.949 --> 37:57.290
No-one messes with my family.

38:07.223 --> 38:10.921
- Do you think he's got a shot?
- Not without help.

38:14.483 --> 38:16.148
Will.

38:18.358 --> 38:19.823
Yeah.

38:24.508 --> 38:26.864
Hey, what did I miss?

38:29.324 --> 38:32.114
- These things don't work?
- Uh,... ish.

39:00.157 --> 39:01.790
Fire!

39:05.757 --> 39:07.690
Keep firing!

39:07.725 --> 39:09.924
Magnus, now!

39:19.842 --> 39:21.856
Go, I've got it!

39:27.791 --> 39:29.068
Hey, buddy.

39:29.103 --> 39:31.254
We need to get him back to
the Sanctuary right away.

39:31.289 --> 39:33.656
I'll take him.

39:34.323 --> 39:36.040
- Oh boy!
- There we go.

39:43.457 --> 39:46.434
He's breathing. Henry
is getting the toxin.

39:46.469 --> 39:48.626
We need to get this suit
off him right away.

39:48.823 --> 39:52.002
No.
Walter, we have no choice. Thank you.

39:52.037 --> 39:53.890
No, wait, please!

39:56.624 --> 39:58.823
It's leaving.

40:16.255 --> 40:18.389
What the hell just happened?

40:18.424 --> 40:21.856
I guess I just.... wished it off.

40:24.554 --> 40:26.733
I didn't want it to die.

40:27.490 --> 40:30.904
For the first time since I got it
I truly wanted it off.

40:32.510 --> 40:34.656
I guess it was just
granting my wish.

40:36.056 --> 40:38.029
May I?

40:38.390 --> 40:40.147
Thank you.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.152
I'll miss you, little buddy.

40:49.590 --> 40:51.524
Live long and prosper.

40:53.994 --> 40:56.257
Get him to the infirmary.

40:56.854 --> 40:58.350
Yeah.

41:06.757 --> 41:10.485
It just did that because of
the heat of his hand, right?

41:11.559 --> 41:12.924
Right?

41:12.959 --> 41:14.290
Come on...

41:23.001 --> 41:26.280
- Oh, hey, you asked to see me?
- Yes.

41:26.691 --> 41:29.368
Henry said that when he
was feed Sorkel tonight,

41:29.403 --> 41:31.308
it wasn't hungry.

41:31.343 --> 41:33.230
I wondered if you know
anything about that.

41:33.265 --> 41:35.205
No.

41:35.455 --> 41:37.340
Then I guess you would
also have no idea,

41:37.375 --> 41:39.624
why all the security cameras
in the main lab

41:39.659 --> 41:43.657
suddenly malfunctioned at
exactly 9:14 this evening.

41:43.792 --> 41:46.696
- No idea.
- I see.

41:54.953 --> 41:59.113
I asked Henry to move your things
into more permanent quarters.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.735
You what?

42:02.490 --> 42:04.390
I trust that meets with your agenda?

42:06.691 --> 42:08.791
Uh, that would be great.

42:12.501 --> 42:14.657
Dr. Magnus?

42:15.956 --> 42:17.690
Thanks.

42:29.907 --> 42:31.861
Is there a meeting?

42:32.856 --> 42:34.939
What are you guys doing?

42:34.974 --> 42:37.023
Walter wrote a comic book.

42:38.346 --> 42:40.383
- What?
- Check it out.

42:43.990 --> 42:45.856
"Time to put the kids to bed?"

42:47.292 --> 42:48.589
Oh, no.

42:48.624 --> 42:52.522
No, no, no!

42:52.557 --> 42:54.453
He totally stole my idea!

42:54.488 --> 42:57.359
I was going to publish this when
things to calmed down around here.

42:57.610 --> 42:59.785
- I was!
- That's too bad.

42:59.820 --> 43:02.746
- It's really good.
- Nominated for several awards.

43:02.781 --> 43:05.390
Yeah, and he already
sold the movie rights.

43:07.485 --> 43:10.211
That's you.

43:12.005 --> 43:14.417
Oh, man...
