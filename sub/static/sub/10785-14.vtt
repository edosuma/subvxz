I'm always up for a good party.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.834
Why don't we pick it up
from "God's promise
and warning"?

00:07.834 --> 00:09.875
Pacey, uh, you got a...

00:09.875 --> 00:13.166
I got an "A".
I got an "A", Andie,

00:13.166 --> 00:15.625
and I'm falling hopelessly
in love with you, Andie.

00:15.625 --> 00:18.458
You were with Jack,
you moved on, and you let go.

00:18.458 --> 00:21.458
So now I, in turn,
am letting you go.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.834
Dawson, is clearly over me.
I promise.

00:23.834 --> 00:26.458
Just as long as you're over him,
nothing else matters.

you made this whole thing
by yourself.

00:36.667 --> 00:37.834
Congratulations, Jack.

00:37.834 --> 00:39.417
Thanks.
I'm not completely done, though.

00:39.417 --> 00:42.208
I mean, I still have this
whole back section to paint.

00:42.208 --> 00:46.542
So I'm truly impressed
and-- and grateful.

00:46.917 --> 00:49.291
I'm still a little unclear
though as to
why you wanted this.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.375
You're not going to
blow it up or anything, are ya?

00:51.375 --> 00:54.125
No. No. There's
no asteroid in my movie.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.583

00:55.583 --> 00:56.959

and the right light,

quaint Creekside village.

camera trickery can do.

Well,
if you guys will excuse me,

01:03.667 --> 01:06.375
I have a ton of homework
to do, including
Peterson's assignment,

01:06.375 --> 01:08.125

even started yet.

less believable than

Oh, yeah.
It's a disgusting habit.

01:17.458 --> 01:19.041

assignment about?

02:14.708 --> 02:15.792
Ah, a poem.

about something that's
critical to our being.

Whatever. It's just
another assignment

an inevitable obstacle
in our relationship.

that we should go out

However, you
neglected penmanship,

08:35.125 --> 08:38.417
and presentation
is half the grade,

08:38.417 --> 08:41.917
so, as I see it,
you have two choices:

08:41.917 --> 08:44.875
you can bring
the poem in tomorrow,
written legibly

08:44.875 --> 08:47.500
and lose points
for handing it in late,

08:47.500 --> 08:52.166
or you can hand it in as it is,
and the highest grade you'll see

read his poem in class.

SECOND BOY:
Here's the best part...

12:55.208 --> 12:59.959
The poem, it's about a guy.
McPhee's a total homo.

- Sure.

Have you talked to Jack yet?

Oh, we haven't really
talked about it yet. No.

about it.

13:31.291 --> 13:33.250
Yeah, I can imagine.

on this one.

I've heard about the incident
twice more.

You've heard about it?
I've heard everything

from Jack is seen
regularly wearing dresses
down Main Street

into a monastery to deal
with his sexual ambivalence.

You're being pretty flip
about this.

Well, why not, Dawson?
I mean, it's all a big joke.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000

I'm concerned about you.

trying to do, Dawson,

14:02.500 --> 14:05.625
give validity to
some ridiculous rumor
that Jack's gay?

14:05.625 --> 14:08.083
- No. Joey, I never said that.
- You pretty much did.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.125
All I'm trying to do is find out
what's going on.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.875
I would hope that
you know me well enough

14:11.875 --> 14:13.333
to know that my concern
is genuine.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.166
There's no need to be
so defensive about this.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.125
I'm not being defensive,
Dawson.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.500
Why don't we just say
what this conversation
is really about?

14:19.500 --> 14:22.583
Your passive aggressive way
of highlighting some flaw
in Jack

14:22.583 --> 14:24.166
that would get us to break up.

14:24.166 --> 14:25.542
That's way over the line.

No, it's not.
From where I'm standing,

14:27.291 --> 14:29.000

it's perfectly in bounds.

why he had to write

15:06.750 --> 15:08.041
I mean, if he hadn't
written something

15:08.041 --> 15:10.250
that could have been so easily
misinterpreted, then--

15:10.250 --> 15:11.834

censored himself?

than to expose himself

I can't, and I never will.
Not after what you did.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.542
You have a good afternoon.

38:35.041 --> 38:36.333
How'd it go?

38:39.959 --> 38:41.542
As well as could be
imagined.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.166
They suspended me
for a week.

38:48.166 --> 38:50.333
Why'd you bother
coming down here?

38:51.458 --> 38:53.291
Because I care about you.

38:55.041 --> 38:58.333
- Do you?
- What kind of question is that?

38:58.959 --> 39:00.875
It's a reasonable one, Andie.

39:02.291 --> 39:04.875
Do you have any idea
what I went through today?

39:05.333 --> 39:07.125
How much I needed
your support?

39:08.542 --> 39:12.250
Pacey, I can't support
everything you do. I never will.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.333
I don't want you to agree
with every decision I ever make.

39:14.333 --> 39:16.291
The world would be
a boring place if you did,

39:16.291 --> 39:20.166
but what I am asking for
is to know that some way,

39:20.166 --> 39:21.917
somehow,
you're there for me.

39:23.083 --> 39:28.041
How dare you?
I challenge one action of yours,

39:28.041 --> 39:30.500
and you throw it in my face
like it's some sort of weakness?

39:30.500 --> 39:32.875
It's not just me.
You weren't there
for your brother Jack, either.

39:32.875 --> 39:35.083
Oh, yes, I was.
I apologized to him,

39:35.083 --> 39:36.708
and I came to apologize
to you, too,

39:36.708 --> 39:41.542
but for some reason
I was struggling with it
all the way down here.

39:41.542 --> 39:44.458
That reason has suddenly
become crystal clear.

39:44.458 --> 39:46.458
Jack is innocent, Pacey.

39:46.458 --> 39:50.458
What's happening to him
right now he has no control
over, but you--

39:50.458 --> 39:52.250
you knew what you were
doing in that classroom.

39:52.250 --> 39:53.375
What would you have me do,

39:53.375 --> 39:55.208
just stand there
and let Peterson do that to him

39:55.208 --> 39:57.208
- when I knew the whole time...
- There are other ways--

39:57.208 --> 40:01.083
that it was my fault, Andie?
It was my fault!

40:02.667 --> 40:05.208
Peterson knew that he couldn't
get the best of me,

40:05.208 --> 40:07.041
so he went after your brother.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.291
If I hadn't instigated him
that day...

40:11.959 --> 40:13.625
None of this would've ever
happened.

40:16.542 --> 40:18.542
That's why I had to stop it.

40:18.542 --> 40:21.542
However I could, I just--I had
to stop it.

40:22.333 --> 40:25.333
Why didn't you tell me
that you felt responsible?

40:27.083 --> 40:28.583
Because, Andie...

40:30.625 --> 40:32.417
You didn't want to
hear about it.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.500
You just wanted me
to clean up the mess.

40:37.417 --> 40:39.917
And there are some messes
you just have to live with.

40:44.750 --> 40:46.291
I'm gonna go home now.

40:53.875 --> 40:55.583
Do you want me to come with you?

40:57.917 --> 41:01.041
No. Not tonight.

41:16.750 --> 41:17.750
Hey, Jack.

41:18.250 --> 41:20.458
Hey, where you been?
I've been covering both shifts.

41:22.166 --> 41:25.834
- Are you gay?
- Excuse me?

41:28.375 --> 41:31.792
Are you gay?
I mean, you don't have
to answer right away.

41:31.792 --> 41:32.959
I just had to ask right away

41:33.250 --> 41:35.458
because it's been
building up in me
and there's no easy way

41:35.458 --> 41:37.792
for a girl to ask her boyfriend
if he's gay than to just ask.

41:37.792 --> 41:40.166
I know you already told me
that the poem wasn't about a guy

41:40.166 --> 41:42.041
but I feel like
when we discussed it,

41:42.041 --> 41:44.834
we never really discussed it,
and I never really asked.

41:44.834 --> 41:46.542
Feel free to answer
any minute now--

41:46.542 --> 41:50.750
No. No. I'm not gay.

41:54.625 --> 41:56.166
Ok. Uh...

41:57.000 --> 41:59.208
You don't know
what a relief that is.

42:00.083 --> 42:01.333
I mean, not that I care,

42:01.333 --> 42:03.667
I would've dealt with it fine,
I promise. It's just...

42:04.250 --> 42:06.667
Who wants to deal
with all the obvious and
not so obvious issues

42:06.667 --> 42:11.542
of a girl who's dating a guy
who turns out to be gay?
And it's just so hard, and...

42:34.041 --> 42:35.458
Hey. Feel better now?

42:37.917 --> 42:39.458
You know, even though...

42:47.166 --> 42:50.583
- Could you do me a favor?
- Yeah, what?

42:52.959 --> 42:58.083
No more poems.
Just for a little while.

42:59.500 --> 43:00.750
You got it.

43:02.834 --> 43:04.041
No more poems.

43:27.250 --> 43:33.208
- I'm not gay, Joey. Ok?
- Yeah.
