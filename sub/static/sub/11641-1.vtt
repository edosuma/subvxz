00:43.120 --> 00:46.602
<i>They messed with my brain.</i>

00:46.680 --> 00:48.648
<i>Thought they knew
what they'd get.</i>

00:48.720 --> 00:50.051
<i>But they were wrong.</i>

00:51.040 --> 00:53.691
<i>They don't know me.</i>

00:53.760 --> 00:56.889
<i>I don't know what happens next,
but this I do know.</i>

00:56.960 --> 01:01.090
<i>You hurt me, I hurt you worse.</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:27.286
Excuse me.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.808
Hi there.
My wife was in last week

01:30.880 --> 01:33.042
and she ordered
a brown duffle in leather.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.851
We were only able to locate
in black, sir.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.082
Well, she'll be
very disappointed.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.123
Right.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.850
Okay, thank you very much.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.804
- Hey, Jillie.
<i>- No, Daddy, it's Emma.</i>

02:00.880 --> 02:02.882
<i>I can't find my Elly.</i>

02:02.960 --> 02:05.167
Hey, baby, we'll find it.
Put Mommy on.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.208
Mommy, it's Daddy.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.008
- Hey, Billy.
<i>- Hey, Jillie.</i>

02:12.120 --> 02:13.849
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

02:13.920 --> 02:16.764
That depends really.
What are you wearing?

02:17.760 --> 02:19.364
Lingerie.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.364
Same thing I always wear
when I pick up Emma from school.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.360
That explains the good grades
she's been getting.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.290
<i>Hello? Billy?</i>

02:29.360 --> 02:32.125
<i>Um, listen, I gotta go. I'm gonna call
you back a little bit later.</i>

02:32.200 --> 02:33.565
<i>All right, baby.
Love you.</i>

03:04.480 --> 03:06.562
Hey! That's my bike!

03:27.800 --> 03:29.086
So we lost him off the bridge,

03:29.200 --> 03:30.929
but he has three options
at the roundabout.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.651
Waterloo Road, Stamford Street,
and Waterloo Bridge.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.802
He's been off the grid
for 20 minutes.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.362
I want two by twos
out from the roundabout.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.761
- Hey, Charlie, re-wreck every screen.
- Sir.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.286
Found him.
Bank two.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.647
Duffle's gone.
Money's gone.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.449
- Time stamp?
- It's now.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.165
Hey.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.456
- <i>Where to, mate?
- Just drive.</i>

04:30.480 --> 04:32.562
Please, thank you.
Not too fast.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.160
It's a black cab.

04:37.280 --> 04:42.002
License number S-I-5-2-J-G-N.
I'm on him.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.969
I-5-2...

04:44.040 --> 04:45.690
J-G-N.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.128
Boyd,

04:51.200 --> 04:53.089
William.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.608
Can I borrow your mobile, mate?
20 quid extra.

05:02.680 --> 05:03.920
- Borrow me phone?
- Yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.810
20 quid?
One call, yeah?

05:14.760 --> 05:16.603
It's Billy.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.125
They're all over him.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.176
Get him to the cement factory
in Deptford. We used it before.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.362
Get a laundry team rolling, now.

05:24.360 --> 05:29.048
We're going to a cement factory.
Hornlink Way, Deptford docks.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.963
I put it in your GPS,
so just follow that.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.485
All right.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.649
<i>Road to destination
has been calculated.</i>

05:42.120 --> 05:43.884
The docks at Deptford.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.166
Very romantic.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.127
<i>Turn left
at the next roundabout.</i>

06:13.080 --> 06:14.730
Move, move, move.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.202
<i>Outside cement factory, sir.</i>

06:38.160 --> 06:40.162
- This isn't a cement factory.
- Eh?

06:40.240 --> 06:42.208
<i>This isn't a cement factory!</i>

06:42.280 --> 06:46.001
Hornlink Way, Deptford. I mean,
the GPS don't lie, mate.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.320
Turn around.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.204
Fuck!

08:04.480 --> 08:07.404
- Do we have him?
<i>- We got nothing, sir.</i>

08:07.480 --> 08:08.720
Nobody here.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.565
Do a GPS on that phone number.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.210
Find him now.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.605
If you've never been
to a slaughterhouse,

08:32.679 --> 08:34.443
you have to go.

08:34.520 --> 08:39.321
To see what we do
to those poor animals.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.403
They use this...

08:43.799 --> 08:45.370
A <i>picana.</i>

08:45.440 --> 08:48.603
Nasty way to push them
towards their doom.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.890
Now where is our friend?

09:05.280 --> 09:06.770
Billy...

09:06.840 --> 09:09.446
<i>I respect your silence.</i>

09:09.560 --> 09:11.608
I really do.

09:12.840 --> 09:17.448
The problem is,
I need the Dutchman.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.528
Last chance.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.170
<i>Fuck you, psycho!</i>

09:44.520 --> 09:46.488
Left. Go, go, go, move.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.606
Going silent.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.011
<i>Point established.
Just arrived on site, sir.</i>

09:55.080 --> 09:56.809
<i>Check right. Check right.</i>

09:56.880 --> 09:58.769
<i>North perimeter is clear.</i>

09:58.840 --> 10:00.649
<i>Bravo, copy.</i>

10:04.640 --> 10:05.880
Go. Go. Go.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.006
Go.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.696
- Action required.
- We need a medic.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.609
<i>Confirmed: Agent Pope.</i>

10:12.680 --> 10:14.728
<i>Perimeter secure.</i>

10:15.760 --> 10:20.448
<i>Agent not responsive.
Repeat, agent not responsive.</i>

10:20.520 --> 10:22.204
<i>Respiration negative.</i>

10:26.160 --> 10:27.400
<i>Ready for defib.</i>

10:27.520 --> 10:29.204
<i>- Charging paddles.</i>
- Clear.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.120
Clear!

10:35.120 --> 10:36.929
<i>He's dead, sir.</i>

10:37.000 --> 10:38.286
Fuck!

10:54.240 --> 10:57.642
Doctor, I'm so sorry, but this man says
he's with the government.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.129
Dr. Franks, I have
one job at the moment,

11:04.200 --> 11:09.240
which is to get you onto a A400 airbus
sitting on a tarmac at Dover ASAP.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.687
Your memory program
is going live.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.570
We have an officer down
and we need what only he knew.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.444
You're going to retrieve it for us.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.443
Does he have any brain activity?

11:23.040 --> 11:24.963
That was taken a few hours ago.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.890
I am five years
away from human trials.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.281
You have 48 hours
to make this work.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.569
National security threat,
highest level.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.251
Can you or can you not
transfer memories

11:36.320 --> 11:38.243
from a dead mammal
to a live one?

11:38.320 --> 11:39.560
Yeah.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.125
What do you need?

11:41.200 --> 11:42.880
I'll need my equipment,
I'll need my staff,

11:42.920 --> 11:45.764
I'll need a suitable,
uh, recipient.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.285
D'you have any candidates?

11:47.360 --> 11:50.921
Um, they're not gonna like him.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.721
<i>Just so wherever
you're taking him knows...</i>

12:01.240 --> 12:05.245
Jerico Stewart. He's in and out
of prison more than half his life.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.085
He's got no impulse control,
no sense of proportion.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.810
He's unable to calculate

12:09.880 --> 12:12.486
the potential negative
consequences of his actions.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.484
<i>He has a total lack of empathy
for anybody or anything.</i>

12:19.120 --> 12:20.121
Through.

12:23.080 --> 12:27.290
He feels nothing.
No hatred, no love.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.283
It gets worse.

12:29.360 --> 12:34.571
This is what was left of a gang member
who tried to recruit him.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.243
Truth is, I have no way
to discipline him.

12:39.360 --> 12:43.649
You can't punish someone who doesn't
know they did anything wrong.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.206
He does not understand society

12:46.280 --> 12:48.726
or how people are
supposed to behave.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.684
Come on.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.683
- <i>Hey, Jerico.</i>
- Come on.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.882
These men are here to see you.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.370
They're taking you out.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.088
I haven't had my lunch.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.401
<i>That's right.
Get Jerico his lunch.</i>

13:18.480 --> 13:19.896
- Yeah.
- Send in the lunch.

13:19.920 --> 13:23.811
That's right,
get Jerico his lunch.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.524
<i>Lunch in the hole.</i>

13:26.600 --> 13:29.604
Come on. Yeah.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.324
Yeah.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.609
All right, enough of this shit.
Lunch is over.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.006
You're coming with us now.
Let's go.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.320
I can't.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.406
I got a chain around my neck.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.404
Oh!

13:53.280 --> 13:55.328
You know you're gonna have
to use two of those.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.886
Oh!

14:01.880 --> 14:03.405
Yeah!

14:07.960 --> 14:09.769
You fuckers.

14:09.840 --> 14:13.731
Oh, you fuckers.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.080
Got him.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.444
<i>That's it.
Open the cell.</i>

14:19.520 --> 14:20.885
Go!

14:28.960 --> 14:31.361
<i>Chopper Gamma EMHG special,</i>

14:31.440 --> 14:34.569
<i>you are clear for approach
on runway 2-2-Lima.</i>

14:34.640 --> 14:36.608
<i>You better wake him up.</i>

14:55.160 --> 14:57.162
Give this to the doctor.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.000
<i>Any allergies, Jerico?</i>

15:48.960 --> 15:52.089
- What?
- Anything you're allergic to?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.400
- Yeah, luck.
- Ha!

15:53.480 --> 15:56.245
Good kind or the bad kind?

15:56.320 --> 15:58.288
You tell me.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.283
We're all set, doctor.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.522
Any previous surgeries?

16:02.600 --> 16:04.125
Previous?

16:05.960 --> 16:07.849
I don't need no surgery...

16:07.960 --> 16:10.611
All right, hit him with 150 mg
of hydroxyzine.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.056
- That's enough of this.
- 150. Yes, sir.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.845
<i>What are you doing to me?</i>

16:17.160 --> 16:18.969
Ooh.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.687
Ooh...

16:24.160 --> 16:26.003
You had an injury to your head.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.447
You got hurt, right?
When you were young.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.124
You remember how it happened?

16:34.520 --> 16:36.807
Yeah. My mother...

16:36.880 --> 16:40.009
told my Daddy that
he wasn't my daddy.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.608
So he called her a whore
and threw me out the car window.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.048
I'm gonna take care
of you, Jerico.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.416
<i>My next guest
is Xavier Heimdahl.</i>

16:53.440 --> 16:56.762
<i>He's best known as the founder
of Stone Harp Industries,</i>

16:56.840 --> 16:59.923
<i>makers of phone, computer
and communication systems.</i>

17:00.000 --> 17:03.288
<i>Most recently, he was charged
with treason by the Spanish government.</i>

17:03.360 --> 17:07.523
<i>Mr. Heimdahl, how would you respond
to these very serious allegations?</i>

17:07.599 --> 17:12.891
<i>Well, if it's treasonous to call out
massive corruption at the highest levels</i>

17:12.960 --> 17:15.964
<i>and to expose political murders...</i>

17:16.040 --> 17:18.849
<i>Yes, then I'm guilty.</i>

17:18.920 --> 17:22.049
<i>But your accusations were never actually
proven in a court of law.</i>

17:22.119 --> 17:25.727
<i>Of course not.
How could they be?</i>

17:26.800 --> 17:29.246
<i>The police, the judges and the courts</i>

17:29.360 --> 17:33.081
<i>are all part of the world's
most powerful criminal enterprise.</i>

17:33.160 --> 17:37.290
<i>So to clarify, you're calling for the
overthrow of the Spanish government.</i>

17:37.360 --> 17:40.842
<i>No, no, no. I'm calling for
the overthrow of all governments.</i>

17:40.920 --> 17:42.922
<i>Politicians, religious fanatics.</i>

17:43.080 --> 17:45.082
<i>Brainwashing by corporations,</i>

17:45.160 --> 17:49.210
<i>the corruption of the banking system...
Gone. Gone.</i>

17:50.200 --> 17:53.921
<i>Washington, Berlin, Beijing
will be graveyards.</i>

17:54.000 --> 17:56.048
<i>And only then
people will understand</i>

17:56.120 --> 17:58.202
<i>there is a better way
to run this world.</i>

17:58.280 --> 18:01.648
<i>And that's what you really want here,
worldwide revolution.</i>

18:01.720 --> 18:05.122
<i>Governments must fall.</i>

18:05.200 --> 18:07.202
Got one.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.011
Elsa Mueller.
Former German Special Forces.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.366
One of Heimdahl's.

18:11.440 --> 18:14.842
Guys, you gotta roll.
Jerico Stewart is now landing.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.046
<i>Is Billy still breathing?</i>

19:20.160 --> 19:21.764
<i>Artificially breathing.</i>

19:21.840 --> 19:24.241
<i>The machine's keeping his body
alive but he's gone.</i>

19:24.320 --> 19:26.209
- You see those diodes?
<i>- Mm.</i>

19:26.280 --> 19:29.489
They deliver a micro charge
to his frontal lobe.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.483
Even though his brain
is clinically dead,

19:31.560 --> 19:33.881
the charge fired the neurons
one last time

19:33.960 --> 19:35.962
and lets us build a map
of the neuronal pattern.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.566
And then you transfer it
to the other guy's head?

19:38.640 --> 19:40.563
No, it's not a transfer.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.484
Jerico Stewart was chosen because
he has frontal lobe syndrome,

19:43.560 --> 19:45.244
<i>trauma to the brain
when he was a child.</i>

19:45.320 --> 19:48.369
<i>Incredibly rare.
One in 10 million.</i>

19:48.440 --> 19:51.125
His frontal lobe remains
in an undeveloped state.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.645
A hotbed of neural stern cells.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.929
We stimulate them with theta waves,
duplicating the pattern.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.407
And you've made this work?

19:59.480 --> 20:03.007
Subject rats can walk straight through
mazes they've never seen before.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.411
Rats.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.124
What about human trials?

20:07.200 --> 20:08.486
You're looking at it.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.011
What happened
to the other... other guy?

20:51.440 --> 20:52.816
<i>Drilling commenced.</i>

21:09.680 --> 21:11.648
<i>Recipient port
ready for insertion.</i>

<i>Fiber optic package

21:33.080 --> 21:35.082
<i>Theta waves activated.</i>

21:40.080 --> 21:42.321
<i>Neural stem cell
stimulation commenced.</i>

21:49.640 --> 21:51.642
Testing theta.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.090
Whoa, temperature is spiking.

22:04.520 --> 22:08.320
We've got a bleed.
He's at 102... 104.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.216
Put the cold packs on him
before he strokes out.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.765
What's going on?

22:11.840 --> 22:13.080
We're losing him.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.400
We have to pull out the robotic arm
or he's going to die.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.000
<i>All right, we 're going to pull
the robotics, it's too much for him.</i>

22:22.000 --> 22:25.527
Hey! You pull nothing!

22:25.600 --> 22:27.284
You carry on!

22:27.360 --> 22:30.091
You think I give a shit if he dies?

22:31.440 --> 22:32.771
Carry on!

22:41.080 --> 22:42.525
<i>He's stabilizing.</i>

23:10.400 --> 23:12.402
What are we gonna tell his wife?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.764
Nothing.

23:18.280 --> 23:21.443
As far as she's concerned,
Billy died two days ago.

23:22.440 --> 23:26.081
It's not right.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.845
Not when you come
from nothing, like Billy.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.080
Like you.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.045
<i>Jerico?</i>

24:07.120 --> 24:09.487
<i>Jerico!</i>

24:15.160 --> 24:17.162
<i>Jerico.</i>

24:19.680 --> 24:21.125
Jerico.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.280
Jerico, take it easy,
everything's fine.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.801
<i>- My head.
- I just gave you an injection.</i>

24:28.880 --> 24:31.281
It will take effect in a minute
and you will feel better.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.124
You swear to God?

24:33.240 --> 24:34.810
I do. You can trust me.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.644
Okay, everybody out.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.529
- No, no, there's a protocol...
- No, not you.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.728
You stay.
Everybody else, come on.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.568
Hey, hey. Look at me.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.768
Look at me.
You know who I am?

24:53.160 --> 24:56.687
My... my head's bad,
I need some kind of pill.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.728
Yeah, no, I want
to give them to you.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.280
But first, I need you
to remember.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.807
- Remember what?
- What's your name?

25:04.880 --> 25:06.405
My...

25:06.520 --> 25:08.921
- My name...
- Yeah, your name.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.889
Your name is Bill Pope.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.604
Why are you messing
with me, boss?

25:16.680 --> 25:19.684
I'm sick, doc, I need some kind of shot.
I need something just...

25:19.760 --> 25:22.491
Don't, don't look at him.
He can't help you.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.131
Only you can help you.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.202
Your name is Bill Pope.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.851
You're an intelligence officer
with the CIA.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.208
Intelligence...

25:33.280 --> 25:36.250
What the fuck...
What the fuck?

25:36.320 --> 25:37.856
- Pay attention.
- What did you do to me?

25:37.880 --> 25:40.136
- Pay... Pay attention, all right?
- What did you do to me?

25:40.160 --> 25:43.050
<i>Jan Strook.
Dutch programmer. Genius.</i>

25:43.120 --> 25:45.088
Selling trap doors to Heimdahl.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.730
I need some water.

25:49.600 --> 25:53.286
That's better. Now...

25:53.360 --> 25:54.930
<i>A few days ago,</i>

25:55.000 --> 25:58.561
The Dutchman dug a wormhole
in the deep web.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.920
<i>Will you stop this</i>

25:59.960 --> 26:01.371
and give me a moment with him?

26:01.440 --> 26:03.488
The man has just had
major brain surgery

26:03.560 --> 26:05.760
and he's not going to tell you anything
if you kill him.

26:06.760 --> 26:09.684
Suddenly the Dutchman's got his finger
on the whole Command and Control.

26:09.760 --> 26:13.082
He can fire missiles
anytime, anywhere, mm?

26:13.160 --> 26:16.403
But he's in way over his head.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.209
So the Dutchman
calls you, Bill Pope.

26:18.280 --> 26:19.725
And he needed protection,

26:19.800 --> 26:23.486
offered to make
a deal with you, Bill Pope.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.085
I need something, please.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.571
Aspirin. I'm being good.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.085
Christ, give him an aspirin.

26:28.160 --> 26:31.642
Aspirin is not good for you,
but this will help.

26:35.480 --> 26:38.563
Billy, we had orders to put a bullet
in the Dutchman's head.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.688
- All right? But you forced the play...
- Oh, God...

26:40.760 --> 26:42.330
because you thought
you could trust him.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.482
You thought you could pay him off.
Remember?

26:44.600 --> 26:47.649
Billy, we did it your way.

26:47.720 --> 26:51.088
You got him to the safe house.
Remember?

26:51.200 --> 26:52.690
Anything. Billy!

26:55.280 --> 26:58.170
Where did you put him?
Where is the Dutchman right now?

26:58.240 --> 27:00.163
That is all we need to know.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.480
You were headed back to him

27:01.640 --> 27:02.846
<i>and you picked up the money.</i>

27:02.920 --> 27:06.561
You were going back
to close the deal! Remember!

27:06.640 --> 27:07.926
Remember!

27:14.280 --> 27:17.170
I don't remember nothing, fucker.

27:17.280 --> 27:21.808
You got me confused
with somebody else.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.808
Try family.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.441
Your daughter's name. Huh?

27:33.520 --> 27:34.936
<i>Come on, you remember.
What's her name?</i>

27:34.960 --> 27:37.406
<i>Emma.
Your wife, Jillian.</i>

27:37.480 --> 27:40.006
<i>Jill, huh?</i>

27:40.080 --> 27:41.923
Come on, you dumb shit,
remember!

27:42.000 --> 27:43.923
<i>Something! Anything!</i>

27:45.120 --> 27:47.043
We have nothing,
absolutely fucking zero.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.646
- The science is good.
- Oh, the science is shit!

27:49.720 --> 27:54.009
Look at the fucking science!
How long you been working on this?

27:54.080 --> 27:56.128
18 years.

27:56.200 --> 27:59.409
We want a refund.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.407
- Take out the trash.
- Yes, sir.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.085
Guys, we're back to square one.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.400
We start from the beginning.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.602
Hey, Charlie, pull up
the Dutchman video.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.326
- Yes, sir.
- What a fucking mess.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.249
<i>My name is Jan Strook.</i>

28:36.360 --> 28:39.603
<i>My cybername is Dutchman.</i>

28:39.720 --> 28:42.690
<i>I am now the sole administrator

<i>- and $10 million.</i>
- Turn it off.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.323
All right, guys,
let's, uh, think about this.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.721
There's Heimdahl,
and the safe house, here.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.450
Luggage store is here.

29:12.560 --> 29:16.007
So somewhere between these two
points is the Dutchman, right?

29:16.080 --> 29:17.809
Okay, where?

29:18.960 --> 29:21.531
Hotel, youth hostel,
we'd know about.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.523
Homeless shelter,
we've already checked.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.204
So where the hell is he?

29:46.880 --> 29:48.484
You're not listening to me.

30:19.960 --> 30:22.486
- Hello?
<i>- Uh, Bill Pope, please.</i>

30:22.560 --> 30:24.688
Who's this?

30:24.840 --> 30:29.926
Uh, old friend. Jan Strook.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.526
<i>Is he there?</i>

30:32.640 --> 30:34.642
Billy's...

30:37.480 --> 30:39.084
My husband's dead.

30:45.200 --> 30:48.682
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

30:49.760 --> 30:51.649
<i>Hello?</i>

31:10.680 --> 31:12.569
Can I have a minute, fellas?

31:18.600 --> 31:20.204
Open your mouth.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.491
It's a vessel dilator.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.164
It will increase the blood circulation

31:25.240 --> 31:28.483
and relieve the pressure
inside your head.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.167
Thanks, doc.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.242
They gonna release me now?

31:36.880 --> 31:39.690
You take care of yourself.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.762
Okay.

35:01.840 --> 35:04.286
Oh, fuck.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.650
You all right?

36:41.840 --> 36:43.922
One of those.
I want that.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.809
Â£4.20.

36:45.880 --> 36:48.281
Hey, number 11, order up.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.886
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
- Mm.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.601
Go on.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.967
You're funny.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.690
It's not worth
the kerfuffle, man.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.245
Who is this guy?

37:15.560 --> 37:17.722
What's wrong with your face?

37:17.800 --> 37:21.691
- United, all right!
- Oi, yeah!

37:21.800 --> 37:23.484
- I'm taking your van.
- What?

37:25.400 --> 37:26.925
What did you say?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.525
I said I'm taking your van.

37:28.640 --> 37:31.291
Hey, this nob says
he's taking our van.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.169
What? That's bang
out of order!

37:33.240 --> 37:36.722
That's out of order, mate.
Now fuck off.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.165
Go on, jog on.

37:39.240 --> 37:41.208
Oi!

37:41.320 --> 37:44.449
What the fuck is going on here?

37:44.520 --> 37:45.816
What the fuck is that?

37:47.280 --> 37:49.169
What the fuck?

37:49.280 --> 37:52.602
- My leg! You fuck!
- Martin!

38:07.200 --> 38:09.680
You fucking cunt!

38:22.440 --> 38:24.681
Who is this guy, huh?

38:24.760 --> 38:26.569

42:31.640 --> 42:35.929
No! No! No!

44:25.880 --> 44:27.689
Where's the money, Jill?

44:29.960 --> 44:31.849
No, the big bag full of money.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.684
Hmm?

44:33.760 --> 44:37.242
- Billy's bag.
- I don't know.

Yeah... I know stuff.

47:38.560 --> 47:41.291
<i>And you betrayed me.</i>

47:41.360 --> 47:45.729
I am seeking to turn this control
over to a responsible party.

47:45.880 --> 47:49.930
The Americans have fucked me
and now want to kill me.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.296
<i>I'm going to hunt you down</i>

47:51.320 --> 47:53.800

48:22.800 --> 48:25.724

48:25.840 --> 48:29.287

<i>Jillian called the police.</i>

48:54.440 --> 48:56.249
<i>It matches Jerico.</i>

48:56.320 --> 48:58.368
She told them
he knew personal details.

48:58.440 --> 48:59.771

48:59.840 --> 49:01.330
You're shitting me.

He recognized my voice.

49:03.760 --> 49:05.603
He knew my name.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.848
That's fucked up.

49:10.960 --> 49:12.485
The lab work came back
from forensic

49:12.560 --> 49:14.416
and it confirmed that the two passengers
in the vehicle

49:14.440 --> 49:16.727
were officers
Pfeffer and Butler.

49:16.800 --> 49:19.963
But the third passenger
in the car was not Jerico.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.568
Well, we gotta find him.

49:33.560 --> 49:35.642
<i>All right, what we got?</i>

49:36.960 --> 49:38.371
We got trash for cash.

49:38.440 --> 49:39.680
<i>Nice.</i>

49:49.240 --> 49:50.480
<i>Hmm.</i>

49:52.160 --> 49:53.764
What?

49:56.200 --> 49:57.440
Let's go.

49:57.520 --> 49:59.010
I'm hungry.

50:13.320 --> 50:14.651
<i>Yeah, thanks.</i>

50:18.600 --> 50:21.444
Hi. Can I have those,
and I'll have a vanilla coffee...

50:21.520 --> 50:23.284
<i>- Bonjour, Francoise.
- Bonjour.</i>

50:30.640 --> 50:32.563
What'd I just say?

50:32.640 --> 50:35.086
<i>Pamplemousse,</i> grapefruit.

50:35.160 --> 50:37.925
<i>Boule,</i> sweet roll, and coffee.

50:41.840 --> 50:44.730
I'm speaking Spanish, motherfucker.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.770
It's French...
motherfucker.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.887
<i>Merci.</i>

50:52.960 --> 50:55.566
I don't think we met.

50:55.640 --> 50:58.928
Whoa.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.804
<i>- Anybody else?
- Did you see that?</i>

51:00.880 --> 51:02.166
Anybody else?

51:03.960 --> 51:05.849
Oh. Good.

51:05.920 --> 51:08.651
Who punches someone
in a <i>patisserie?</i> You animal!

51:08.720 --> 51:10.210
Anybody else?

51:10.280 --> 51:12.567
Want to talk about it
over a motherfucking latte?

51:12.640 --> 51:15.689
I think he broke my nose.
Oh, my God. It hurts.

51:15.800 --> 51:18.121
Aww.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.440
<i>Are you all right?</i>

51:19.520 --> 51:21.329
<i>No, I'm not all right!</i>

51:55.360 --> 51:57.761
Hey.

51:57.840 --> 52:00.969
Hey, you got any, uh,
George Orwell books here?

52:01.040 --> 52:02.963
There's a queue, sir,
if you wouldn't mind.

52:03.040 --> 52:05.850
That's right. And I'm at the front
of it, sugar puss.

52:05.920 --> 52:08.730
Maybe you can tell me
where this Orwell guy is.

52:13.640 --> 52:16.166
- 4th floor. Section 41.
- 4th floor.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.527
4th floor. 4th floor.

52:19.840 --> 52:21.285
<i>Sorry.</i>

52:51.240 --> 52:52.685
This ain't right.

52:53.800 --> 52:58.249
Where's the bag, Billy?
Where's the bag?

53:00.760 --> 53:03.001
Oh, God.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.568
Guys, someone's logged in as Billy.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.086
<i>That must be Jerico.</i>

53:18.200 --> 53:19.776
Christ, block it!
Shut it down!

53:19.800 --> 53:23.441
No, leave him in there.
I want to see what he's looking for.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.360
I can't get in the account.
He's locked us out.

53:26.280 --> 53:27.645
What's the access point?

53:27.720 --> 53:29.609
A terminal.
London public library.

53:42.920 --> 53:44.365
- It's this one.
- It's this one.

53:44.440 --> 53:46.886
Okay... um...

53:48.240 --> 53:50.766
Looks like he accessed
our phone tracking software.

53:53.080 --> 53:54.491
Dr. Franks.

53:58.280 --> 54:00.044
- Hello?
<i>- It's Quaker.</i>

54:00.120 --> 54:01.565
Jerico's on his way to you.

54:01.640 --> 54:03.529
<i>We have your location.
Do not hang up.</i>

54:03.600 --> 54:06.570
Do you understand me?
Do not hang up!

54:06.680 --> 54:08.170
<i>I understand.</i>

54:20.480 --> 54:22.482
What's up, doc?

54:22.560 --> 54:24.528
I need more of those pills, all right?

54:24.600 --> 54:26.456
Because without them,
when I remember Bill Pope stuff,

54:26.480 --> 54:27.776
it's like my head's being crushed

54:27.800 --> 54:29.336
from the fucking inside!

54:29.360 --> 54:32.250
- You remember?
- Do I remember?

54:32.320 --> 54:34.721
My fucking skull's splitting apart,
and so is yours gonna be

54:34.800 --> 54:36.325
<i>unless you figure out
how to help me.</i>

54:36.400 --> 54:38.176
<i>Yeah, of course.
Yes, yes, of course.</i>

54:38.200 --> 54:40.168
Well, where to?

54:40.280 --> 54:41.645
Um...

54:41.720 --> 54:43.085
Where to?
I'm not hearing anything.

54:44.160 --> 54:46.606
- A pharmacy. D-down the road.
- Good.

54:47.640 --> 54:49.802
Let's go.

55:05.120 --> 55:07.122
Hello, Dr. Franks.

55:09.520 --> 55:10.851
<i>Hey.</i>

55:10.920 --> 55:13.844
Hey. Hey. Faster the fuck up.

55:15.040 --> 55:16.690
That was mean, I'm sorry.

55:17.760 --> 55:20.570
You hear that?
I'm not sorry.

55:20.640 --> 55:24.087
That's Billy talking, not me.
This guy's fucking up my game.

55:24.160 --> 55:27.846
Billy Pope's personality
is affecting your behavior. Goddamn.

55:27.920 --> 55:29.816
I don't know about Billy, all right?
I don't know about that shit.

55:29.840 --> 55:31.136
All I know is that I'm living this.

55:31.160 --> 55:33.401
<i>I can do stuff.
It was you, all right?</i>

55:33.480 --> 55:36.131
<i>You're the one that put stuff
in my head. I tracked you down.</i>

55:36.200 --> 55:37.611
You have skill sets?

55:37.680 --> 55:40.047
That's right. I do math now.
I talk languages.

55:40.120 --> 55:41.770
I go where I want,
I do what I want.

55:41.840 --> 55:44.081
<i>Everything's different.
I'm brand-new.</i>

55:44.160 --> 55:46.049
<i>Are these memories
chronological?</i>

55:46.120 --> 55:48.327
<i>I don't know. It's kicked off
by shit I see, smells.</i>

55:48.400 --> 55:49.856
You know, sometimes stuff
just blurts out.

55:49.880 --> 55:52.645
Please, I just need one of those pills.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.400
- Okay. Okay.
- All right. All I need is...

55:55.880 --> 55:58.042
All I need is one pill.

55:58.120 --> 56:01.249
<i>You're recalling Billy Pope's
automatic responses to sensory stimulus.</i>

56:01.360 --> 56:03.806
<i>Cognitive sense, touch, smell.</i>

56:03.920 --> 56:06.730
- What about emotions?
- Yeah.

56:06.840 --> 56:09.002
I met his wife and kid.

56:09.080 --> 56:12.766
- And?
- And there was...

56:12.840 --> 56:14.524
There was something.

56:14.640 --> 56:15.880
What do you mean, "something"?

56:15.960 --> 56:20.841
People always told me that I didn't have
feelings about this or that.

56:20.920 --> 56:22.656
I didn't know what they were
talking about until...

56:22.680 --> 56:24.011
I can't.
How do you do this?

56:24.080 --> 56:26.208
It's child-proof.

56:29.920 --> 56:31.285
Yeah.

56:34.480 --> 56:37.165
What about now?

56:37.240 --> 56:39.163
Now it's messing me up.

56:39.240 --> 56:42.244
Or making you better.
It's called emotions.

56:42.320 --> 56:44.607
Hmm.

56:44.680 --> 56:46.682
Well, whatever they are,
I got no use for them.

56:46.760 --> 56:48.649
Not much meaning
in life without them.

56:51.880 --> 56:55.282
Yeah, well.
Thanks for the pills, doc.

56:56.640 --> 56:58.051
I need to run some tests on you

56:58.120 --> 57:01.727
before the re-patterning
starts to fade.

57:01.800 --> 57:04.280
Starts to fade?

57:10.120 --> 57:12.361
How much, uh, time...

57:12.440 --> 57:14.124
...do I got?

57:14.240 --> 57:16.163
48 hours. I don't know.

57:16.240 --> 57:17.816
Maybe there's a way
to make it last longer.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.968
Well, then I better boogie,
right, doc?

57:20.080 --> 57:21.889
Got shit to do.
Money to find.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.401
- Money?
- Yeah. Big bag full of money.

57:24.480 --> 57:28.530
What are you gonna do with money
when you find it?

57:28.600 --> 57:31.331
I don't know.

57:31.440 --> 57:37.083
I might buy a house,
you know. Get a TV.

57:37.160 --> 57:39.208
Go on vacation
like other people, right?

57:39.280 --> 57:40.566
Of course.

57:41.880 --> 57:43.564
Here. Take what I owe you.

57:43.640 --> 57:46.211
- On the house.
- Cheers.

57:47.880 --> 57:50.406
Cheers. Who the fuck
says "cheers"?

58:13.680 --> 58:15.728
Ruiza.

58:15.800 --> 58:18.167
You still owe Billy Â£20 on Arsenal.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.242
Guess it's only fair
you pay me, right?

58:20.320 --> 58:21.656
All right, that's enough!

58:25.040 --> 58:26.451
You remember everything, right?

58:26.520 --> 58:28.522
Where's the Dutchman?

58:30.160 --> 58:33.562
I don't know. But I remember
Mike's busted-up ankle.

59:02.440 --> 59:04.016
<i>I don't know what your men do,</i>

59:04.040 --> 59:06.646
<i>I don't know how they do it,
but you have got to stop hitting him,</i>

59:06.720 --> 59:08.449
especially in the head.

59:08.560 --> 59:12.201
I get the point.
But he's coming over here.

59:12.280 --> 59:13.964
<i>So who am I dealing with in there?</i>

59:14.040 --> 59:15.451
<i>Is it Bill Pope?</i>

59:15.560 --> 59:19.281
<i>No, he's Jerico. But he's influenced
by Billy Pope's memories,</i>

59:19.360 --> 59:21.203
<i>skill sets, routines.</i>

59:21.280 --> 59:23.647
- Routines?
<i>- Yeah, routines.</i>

59:23.720 --> 59:26.451
<i>Most of what we do in life
is reduced to subconscious routine.</i>

59:26.560 --> 59:31.282
<i>It's these things that have made
the leap from Bill Pope into Jerico.</i>

59:31.360 --> 59:32.771
<i>He mentioned money, a bag of it.</i>

59:32.880 --> 59:34.723
<i>It's driving him.
Offer him that money,</i>

59:34.840 --> 59:36.136
he'll give you anything you want.

59:36.160 --> 59:38.242
Take him to the last place
you had the Dutchman,

59:38.320 --> 59:41.005
trigger Billy Pope's memories,
and follow the trail.

59:41.080 --> 59:43.481
Source in Lubyanka Square
just forwarded this to us.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.807
The Dutchman is trying
to make a deal with the Russians.

59:45.880 --> 59:48.440
<i>Says he's gonna
give them proof today at 6:00 P.M.</i>

59:49.320 --> 59:52.051
Did you hear that?
We're fucked.

59:52.120 --> 59:56.569
Because you wanted a psychopath
instead of a hero from Seal Team Six.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.122
The ransom money in the bag.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.771
You take us to the Dutchman,
it's yours.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.688
Do we have a deal?

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.640
<i>Do we have a deal?</i>

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.730
That. That.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.527
Yeah. The beach.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.564
I want that too.
I want to go there.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.130
<i>Okay.</i>

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.646
Okay, you can go to the beach.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.167
Now, do we have a deal?

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.690
Yeah.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.760
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Get your hands off him!

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.531
Stand down!

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.922
Only you can put out this fire.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.168
The Dutchman.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.131
Where is he?
And the money's yours.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.202
The money's mine?

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.044
All of it.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.690
I want to go there.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.644
And the picture. Yeah.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.811
Which way, Jerico?

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.406
Right.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.402
Sir, the facial recognition system
just picked up a red notice.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.006
Pull over! Pull over!

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.846
Put the convict on ice
and send him home.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.570
- That's it?
- The Dutchman's been flagged

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.005
at London City airport.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.969
<i>MI-5 are covering him.</i>

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.929
We're heading over.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.411
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.925
Hey, my money.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.571
Hey! What about my money?

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.643
Elsa, he's yours now.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.882
<i>I need him alive.</i>

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.571
I'm afraid it's not your man.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.967
I'm hit!

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.451
Give me the gun!

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.086
Don't shoot him!

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.442
Sir, we ordered a dive team
to search for Jerico's body.

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.807
What a fucking mess.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.402
The Russians cannot be
allowed to make the buy.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.811
Blanket their embassy.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.968
Anything in, anything out
gets covered.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.371
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.887
And that fucker Heimdahl's been
up our asses from the start.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.891
I want new passcodes,
new firewalls.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.368
- Switch to military channels, got it?
- Yes, sir.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.562
<i>Gunfire broke out
earlier today on the Connaught Bridge,</i>

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:58.487
<i>with five confirmed fatalities
and numerous seriously injured.</i>

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:02.485
<i>Authorities continue to search
for missing bodies in the river Thames.</i>

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.483
I'm really sorry that I lost him.
Maybe if I...

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.927
If, if, if, if!

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:13.328
If you had kept closer tabs
on the Dutchman,

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.641
maybe we'd already
have the Wormhole!

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.882
I must say I'm not that happy
at the moment, Elsa.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.242
- Do you want me to leave?
- No.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.525
I apologize.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.204
Good.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.811
We need to find Jerico.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.490
Mommy, can I watch TV?

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.131
Sure, baby.
Of course.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.808
What are you doing
in my basement?

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.531
What is all this?

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.571
That belongs to Emma.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.769
<i>Did you work with Billy?</i>

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.686
I don't think anyone like him

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.162
ever would've worked
with somebody like me.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.403
They stuck Billy in my head.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.450
I got a scar. See?

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.087
All the stuff that he knew,
all the stuff that he could do,

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.929
I got it all scrambled up
inside me.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.690
That's impossible.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.848
First car you two ever bought,
used... used Rover.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.445
It smelled like fish and chips.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.443
Bum clutch blew the first week.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.843
Cost you 1,100 quid
to get it fixed.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.527
I told you.
They stuck his brain in me.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.523
- That's enough.
<i>- Mom?</i>

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.807
<i>Mom, where are you?
I'm hungry.</i>

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.882
Just a second, baby.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.241
Sunday night.
Chicken and waffles.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.804
You do the chicken,
I do the waffles.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.441
I know that she likes
the syrup on the bottom only.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.808
I get pieces.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.804
Things pop up.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.966
Different places, I...
I see things.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.088
Don't ask me how they did it,
but they...

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.322
...they did it.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.801
Why?

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.160
Oh, God.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.523
They're looking for details about where
your husband stashed a guy

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.886
before he was killed.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.883
Now, go feed your kid.
I'll finish here and...

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.530
I'll finish here and get out.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.284
Leave you alone.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.526
No.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.371
Billy could never hurt you, Jill,
so neither can I.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.484
Hot bird in tube 4, sir.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.176
- That's not possible.
- Guidance system's a go!

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.441
- Tracking system's a go!
- Shut it down!

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.971
I can't!
We're locked out, sir!

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.967
Missile away! Repeat!
Missile away!

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.007
Punch in the self-destruct code
before the fish can arm itself!

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.890
Alpha 30, echo 40, Bravo Hotel.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.448
Negative.
It's not responding.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.486
We're good.
No nuke flash. We're good.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.450
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.296
<i>We didn't
terminate that missile, sir.</i>

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.490
Did you know I lost my Daddy?

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.567
Yeah.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.928
He gave me Elly.
For my birthday.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.284
If we don't go deeper,
his trunk's gonna stick out.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.442
<i>Go deeper.</i>

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.283
Did you hurt yourself?

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.042
Stop.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.451
Emma, come here, please.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.488
No, Mommy.
We're burying my Elly.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.244
Come here.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.886
<i>He said he was a friend of Daddy's.</i>

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.686
Leave. Please.

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.210
Can he stay for dinner?
He's nice.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.565
Emma, go inside.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.602
I'll do the waffles,
then I'll go.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.491
- Come and play.
- What?

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.965
Come and play.

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.564
I don't know how.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.880
I'll teach you.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.136
I don't know if this is
such a good idea.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.401
It's fine. Come on.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.531
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Come on.</i>

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.889
So you just put
your hands like this.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.361
Put your hand there.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.680
And then you go...

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.806
It's okay.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.282
<i>That's right.
And then you go again.</i>

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.644
Okay, Emma. It's late.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.165
It's time to go to bed.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.449
Yes, Mommy.
Good night, Jerico.

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.329
<i>- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, baby.</i>

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.891
Who are you?

01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.886
I don't know.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.884
Most of my life, a number.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:08.886
My brain don't always work right.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.721
I haven't always acted right.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.087
Having your man
in my head made me...

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.680
...made me feel things.
Know things.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.362
Right. Wrong.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.560
I guess it don't matter.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.803
Doc says it's all going away
pretty soon.

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.324
Can you feel what Billy felt?

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.804
Can you?

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.004
There was this funny thing
Billy used to do.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.886
This is too much.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:02.046
That was our signal
that he loves me.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.647
I, uh...

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.845
I know... I know...

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:15.563
I know what that "love" word's
supposed to mean, but I...

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.085
I never...

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.650
Our wedding day.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.051
<i>Do you remember?</i>

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.970
Yes.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.045
<i>The beach.</i>

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.283
- First time I handed you Emma?
- Yeah...

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.761
You were so happy.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.561
Yeah. I have...

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.206
I feel it.

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.568
I feel it. Yeah, I...

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.885
He loves you... so much.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.803
Where will you go now?

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:08.804
I don't know, wherever he...
wherever he takes me.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.011
Then stay here.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.646
<i>You can stay on the couch.</i>

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:24.411
It won't be the first time
on that couch.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.808
<i>Our top story, a mystery missile</i>

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.121
<i>that was launched
off the coast of Portugal.</i>

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.885
<i>The question is,
where'd this missile come from?</i>

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.256
<i>Our adversaries
are getting more sophisticated.</i>

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:49.683
Good morning.
Got you some fresh coffee.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.250
Thanks.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:59.850
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.005
<i>...where this missile came from,</i>

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.242
<i>we won't know who will be held
accountable.</i>

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:09.609
<i>This is now the smoking gun.
We have radar analysis...</i>

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.769
You work at the university.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.042
<i>There's a cage in the library, right?</i>

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.724
A bookcase with a key.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.609
Yeah, the rare book collection.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.444
Billy and I used to go there
sometimes.

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.136
<i>- Why? Does this have something...?</i>
- Yes.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.446
Yes.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.364
Everything.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.805
I'll need a car.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.928
<i>And the key for the books.</i>

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.480
<i>Sure. Yeah.</i>

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.404
We're gonna have money, Jill.

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.084
Lots of it.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.964
I wish I could keep being him.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.527
Emma?
Come upstairs, please!

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.931
<i>Coming!</i>

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.680
Come. We need to take a shower.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.967
- Did you lock the door downstairs?
- Yeah.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.849
Where is Jerico?

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.926
Yeah.
Georgie Orwell.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.804
Yeah.

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.365
Oh.

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.929
You're the guy who killed me.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.327
Good memory.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.050
Yeah.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.123
You hurt me.
I hurt you worse.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.810
I respect your creed.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.564
Mm, good.

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.089
Over there.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.889
Sir, I have something.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.611
Akhmadov.
Russian FSB operative.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.968
What's he doing arriving
on a fishing boat in Dagenham?

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.770
The Russians
aren't stupid enough

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.416
to try making a move
from their own embassy.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.240
They're bringing in a grab team
to pick up the Dutchman.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.924
Get me in the air now!

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:35.485
He'll be on the A11,
headed right toward us.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:38.325
<i>We follow the Russians.
They'll lead us to the Dutchman.</i>

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.207
I don't particularly
like children.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.328
They never live up to their hype.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.528
Jerico!
Jerico, help! Please!

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.125
Get in there.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.521
Stop! Stop! Please!

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.571
Stop.

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.883
No more violence.
No more violence.

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.883
Get him up.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.050
Take me to the Dutchman.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.844
He's in there.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.446
<i>Give me thermals.</i>

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.567
The Russian grab team
is in the truck.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.529
We follow.
Do not engage.

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.926
<i>All units, we are
in ghost surveillance.</i>

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.527
<i>- Do not approach.
- Copy that.</i>

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.124
There.
At the university.

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.168
Do not approach until
we see the Dutchman.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.890
<i>All units, do not approach.</i>

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.081
<i>- Copy that. Stand down.
- Roger that.</i>

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:12.840
Let's go.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.643
<i>Sniper team.
What's your position?</i>

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.041
Sniper team on the move.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.524
<i>Sir, we have a visual
on Heimdahl and Jerico.</i>

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:45.046
- Move in! Move in!
- All units, move in.

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.408
<i>Take out the Russian team.
We need Jerico alive.</i>

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.249
Your wife and kid just died.

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.731
Get this thing on the ground.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.606
No, your guy's not over there.
They don't have him.

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.016
- What do you mean?
- I just said it.

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.247
They don't have him.
All right? I just told you.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.322
You tell the psycho.
He's up there, all right?

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.040
He's not over there.
They don't have him.

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:31.527
I'll go. Get to the airfield.
You need to get out of here.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.329
Get the Dutchman.
See you there.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.086
Where are we going?

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.810
Through here.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.080
Jillian's office.

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.808
Where is he?

01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.120
In the corner office.
See him?

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:23.800
Get out.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.611
- Don't kill me.
- Shut up.

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:06.286
You don't know me, all right?
But I know you.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.404
You and Pope made a deal.

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.209
He's dead,
but he's making it good.

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:16.162
That's your money.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.526
That's your passport.

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.606
<i>Ah.</i>

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.569
- The passport.
- The Wormhole. Where is it?

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.688
It's in my computer.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.683
- Set it up.
- No problem.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.329
You do exactly
what I tell you to do,

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.442
maybe you'll live to spend
all this money.

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.848
You're a fucking genius.

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:04.930
This is some good
crazy shit right here.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.651
Live by the sword,
die by the sword.

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.324
Brilliant.

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:14.122
Fuck!

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.520
- Give me the flash drive.
- I'll give you anything you want.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.324
- Come on. Don't make me wait.
- Yeah. Here.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:22.529
- Flash drive.
- Thank you.

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.648
Fuck!

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.529
<i>Fuck you...</i>

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:30.365
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Painful?

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:35.281
Giving Heimdahl Vigilant Shield
is fucking crazy!

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:43.921
- <i>Elsa?</i>
- I got it.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.571
I'm on my way. The Dutchman
and Jerico are dead.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:49.086
<i>Good girl.
I'm waiting for you.</i>

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.849
<i>Elsa?</i>

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.160
<i>Elsa?</i>

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.681
Fuck you.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.283
You need an ambulance, sir.
Just wait over here.

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:46.283
I'll send the paramedic
over to you immediately.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.567
- Can I get paramedics?
- Okay.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.606
Who is that?

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.760
She's dead.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:30.162
Yeah. Here.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.322
Take the computer.
Have it scanned.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.846
Stolen ambulance right outside.
Wounded man took it.

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.450
Fits the description of Jerico.

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.056
- Jerico's got it.
- On our way.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.720
Somebody get me a track
on that ambulance.

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:46.766
Elsa?

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.896
<i>Does this sound
like Elsa to you, motherfucker?</i>

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:51.287
- Where is she?
- I beat your girlfriend up.

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:53.044
She's dead.
Fuck her, all right?

01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:54.451
I got what you want.

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.045
So here's what's gonna happen.

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.361
Are you dictating terms to me?

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.169
That's right, psycho.

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.044
Get the little girl.

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.963
I'm sending you directions.

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.281
- You come here...
- No, no, no.

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.727
<i>...and deliver me that flash drive.</i>

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:11.371
Or they die.
Say something.

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.805
Jerico, help, he's taking me.

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.370
<i>- He's gonna do something.</i>
- Hey.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.736
<i>His little one first...</i>

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.285
so her Mommy can watch.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.930
Do you understand?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.968
I'm gonna fuck you up.

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.371
I'm gonna fuck you up!

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.250
<i>Jerico! Jerico!</i>

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.362
Do not give him the flash drive.

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.681
<i>Do you understand me?
He will scorch the earth.</i>

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.525
<i>You copy?</i>

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.011
I got this figured out.

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.248
Jerico, you have nothing figured.

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:53.322
You only have
half a fucking brain.

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.890
<i>You are not Bill Pope.</i>

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.606
He has a gun to her head,
asshole, all right?

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.571
He has a gun to the... to the baby.

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.921
What's her name?
I can't remember her name.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.571
<i>Emma!
Her name is Emma!</i>

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.926
Patch in the ambulance radio.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.207
We're on. He can hear you.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.725
Jerico, it's Dr. Franks.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.041
<i>I think I can freeze
what's left of the implant, Jerico.</i>

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.360
<i>You can be normal.</i>

01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:18.211
But we have to do this now,
before it's gone.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.726
You turn around,
come back here and see me.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.040
What about Jillian?

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.009
There's too many lives
at stake, Jerico.

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.809
<i>We're all gonna die.</i>

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.609
Leave them.
They don't matter.

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.166
They do to me.

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:23.160
Little closer.

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.848
Yeah!

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.336
<i>Officers down! Officers down!</i>

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:53.523
<i>Medical units en route.
We have casualties.</i>

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.286
He's getting close,
so let's get ready.

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:44.087
Jerico!

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.443
No!

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:05.965
He's got Emma.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.531
Put it down.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.650
Put it down!

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:35.725
Give me the flash drive.

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.925
Emma, run!

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.570
What are the coordinates down there?

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:34.328
I have a... little souvenir
for them.

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.726
- <i>Quaker!</i>
- Copy!

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:08.566
<i>Heimdahl just fired one of our cruise
missiles 60 miles north of you.</i>

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.803
<i>Evacuate the area.
Get out of there!</i>

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.446
Hey! Do you have any idea
what you've done? Yeah?

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:20.410
You killed us all,
you fucking asshole!

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:22.801
Hey! What are you doing?
He just got shot, for God's sake!

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.450
Get back!
Get her out of here!

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.170
<i>Get her out of here!</i>

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.686
Ah, you worry too much.

01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:32.287
I made...
I made that guy fix it.

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.522
- Who?
- I can't remember his name.

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.011
- Jan Strook?
- No.

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.491
The Dutchman?
The Dutchman?

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.130
Yeah. Yeah.

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.804
Yeah, the Dutchman.
He fixed it.

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.689
- Fixed what?
- He...

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:47.049
Jerico! Jerico, what did
the Dutchman fix?

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.011
<i>Heimdahl's first shot.</i>

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:58.490
Whatever it was, wherever
he tried to send it...

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.084
<i>...it comes back for him.</i>

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.202
I told that motherfucker...

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.409
You hurt me, I hurt you worse.

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:12.085
Fuck me.

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.325
My head's cold.

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.367
I'm cold.

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:34.480
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.807
He hasn't been responding.

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.764
Maybe this will trigger something.

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:42.008
If he remembers anything,
he remembers it all

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.570
and Bill Pope is here to stay.

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.166
You might not remember me,

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.766
but I know you.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.480
<i>It's unbelievable.
He remembers.</i>

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:27.005
You gonna release him now,
turn him loose?

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.002
I'm gonna offer him a job.
