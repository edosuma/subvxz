WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:05.336
All right, son, all
you gotta do is jump.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.785
I'm a little scared.

00:08.788 --> 00:12.577
It's okay. I'll catch ya. I promise.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.919
- Lucas!
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

00:21.921 --> 00:24.555
Captain, you're back on the James.

00:24.557 --> 00:25.757
It's over now.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.629
The seeds.

00:31.631 --> 00:33.931
We've got 'em.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.297
They're safe.

00:36.436 --> 00:37.802
They're safe.

00:37.804 --> 00:42.006
Oh, thank God.

00:42.008 --> 00:45.543
No, sir. Thank you.

00:50.950 --> 00:53.351
Captain Chandler,

00:53.353 --> 00:55.820
the main event at a
fight club in Sardinia.

00:55.822 --> 00:56.918
What are the odds?

00:56.921 --> 00:59.523
Ah, well, it's good to have him back.

00:59.526 --> 01:02.493
Yeah, how long before
he takes off on us again?

01:04.798 --> 01:07.465
Look, I love the guy, okay?

01:07.467 --> 01:09.734
I mean, God knows he's saved
all our asses enough times,

01:09.736 --> 01:11.969
he can do whatever the hell he wants.

01:11.971 --> 01:13.938
But we're in another war.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.773
The world is dying again.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.141
And?

01:17.143 --> 01:21.131
And he didn't come lookin' for us.

01:21.134 --> 01:22.737
No, he didn't.

01:22.740 --> 01:25.983
Which means he could
walk away at any time.

01:25.985 --> 01:27.585
Face it, Wolf,

01:27.587 --> 01:30.054
it's only random luck that
got him back on the James.

01:30.056 --> 01:33.057
It was not luck.

01:33.059 --> 01:34.592
It was destiny.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.191
What's that now?

01:38.798 --> 01:41.165
I have been fighting my whole life.

01:41.167 --> 01:44.469
In my country, we fought
for food, for water.

01:44.471 --> 01:49.507
We fought for any reason.
Or for no reason at all.

01:49.509 --> 01:54.112
When the virus came,
we had a common enemy.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.181
But there was no way to beat this virus.

01:57.183 --> 02:00.218
And so we went back
to fighting each other.

02:00.220 --> 02:04.122
And then we heard about the cure.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.791
The Nathan James.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.459
And Captain Tom.

02:09.795 --> 02:13.030
He gave us hope.

02:13.032 --> 02:15.166
I always knew

02:15.168 --> 02:17.468
that when the world needed him again,

02:17.470 --> 02:20.271
he would make his way back to his ship.

02:21.341 --> 02:24.142
And that's why you joined this crew.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.576
You knew he was coming back.

02:25.578 --> 02:29.780
I wanted to thank
him, to learn from him,

02:29.782 --> 02:31.716
to fight with him.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.376
That was my destiny.

"The fault, dear Brutus,
is not in our stars,

03:10.283 --> 03:12.123
but in ourselves."

03:12.125 --> 03:14.926
Climate, disease, famine terrify us.

03:14.929 --> 03:18.759
And our terror begets chaos,
aggression, and violence.

03:18.762 --> 03:20.409
And there's your end of days, man.

03:20.412 --> 03:22.579
World of hazards shifts
at the speed of light...

03:22.582 --> 03:24.268
and we are neither poised,

03:24.270 --> 03:26.437
facile, or quick enough to adapt,

03:26.439 --> 03:30.048
thus, we panic,
accelerate into hysteria,

03:30.051 --> 03:31.209
and kill each other.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.212
And this deficiency is
exactly what destroyed

03:34.214 --> 03:36.681
every single civilization before us

03:36.683 --> 03:39.584
and is exactly what
threatens to obliterate us now

03:39.586 --> 03:43.243
if we do not rapidly resolve
ourselves to the hard problems

03:43.246 --> 03:47.761
and salvation that lie
within evolutionary biology.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.130
And this is where I come in.

03:53.132 --> 03:55.132
Face it,

03:55.134 --> 03:57.335
natural evolution is a bust, man.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.036
Natural evolution used to be smart,

03:59.038 --> 04:00.404
but now it's half-baked and inefficient.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.672
Remember the appendix?

04:01.674 --> 04:03.460
Who the hell needs the appendix now?

04:03.463 --> 04:06.277
Appendix has been rolling around
inside of us like dead weight

04:06.279 --> 04:07.579
for more than a millennium.

04:07.582 --> 04:09.447
Natural evolution is done.

04:09.449 --> 04:12.850
But with transgenic coding,

04:12.852 --> 04:15.319
we seize an immediate future

04:15.321 --> 04:19.249
wherein all people of all
cultures can acclimate, adjust,

04:19.252 --> 04:22.727
and conform to any
challenge of a dynamic planet

04:22.729 --> 04:25.896
in less than one single generation.

04:25.898 --> 04:30.167
And it is not just our bodies
that will step on the gas,

04:30.169 --> 04:33.838
but our minds.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.352
Think about that for a second.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.377
That the guy you met in the arena?

04:39.379 --> 04:42.179
- He's let himself go.
- Paul Vellek.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.282
One of the fathers of
modern bio-informatics

04:44.284 --> 04:46.250
and computational biology.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.919
Also father to Giorgio and Lucia Vellek,

04:48.921 --> 04:51.756
who were kind enough to
escort you to Sardinia.

04:51.758 --> 04:55.259
There's another son,
Christos, whereabouts unknown.

04:55.261 --> 04:57.261
According to your
National Security Agency,

04:57.263 --> 04:58.763
Dr. Vellek wasn't just brilliant,

04:58.765 --> 05:01.157
he was also considered morally
and ethically dangerous.

05:01.159 --> 05:03.492
Apparently, he wasn't satisfied
with boosting crop yields.

05:03.494 --> 05:06.462
He want to "re-engineer
what it means to be human."

05:06.464 --> 05:09.060
Indicted six years ago, he fled the U.S.

05:09.063 --> 05:11.834
And wound up in the Med with
access to a Greek warship.

05:11.836 --> 05:14.270
Most likely, he bought off
of the Greeks with the promise

05:14.272 --> 05:15.319
that they'd be the first to benefit

05:15.321 --> 05:16.584
once he cured the Red Rust.

05:16.587 --> 05:18.507
Then he simply turned to his friend Omar

05:18.509 --> 05:19.976
to steal the actual seeds.

05:19.978 --> 05:23.646
Imagine, the future of the
world in this man's hands.

05:23.648 --> 05:26.148
How long did St. Louis say
it would take to engineer

05:26.150 --> 05:28.017
disease-resistant crops?

05:28.019 --> 05:29.385
A year, maybe more.

05:29.388 --> 05:30.884
Maybe Vellek can help.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.491
Well, if he's really the
genius everyone says he is,

05:35.493 --> 05:37.760
he may have a solution...
Or part of a solution...

05:37.762 --> 05:39.395
Our people haven't thought of yet.

05:39.397 --> 05:41.397
Are you suggesting we
work with this madman?

05:41.399 --> 05:43.632
I'm suggesting we find him,
grab him and his research,

05:43.634 --> 05:45.768
and convince him of the
righteousness of our cause.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.670
- Come on.
- Let him know that cooperating

05:47.672 --> 05:50.006
with our scientists is in
the world's best interest...

05:50.008 --> 05:51.129
And his.

05:51.132 --> 05:53.063
If he can shave off
even three months of work

05:53.066 --> 05:55.778
finding the cure, that's
a lot of mouths fed,

05:55.780 --> 05:57.513
a lot of lives saved.

05:57.515 --> 05:59.465
Any idea where we find him then?

06:01.219 --> 06:03.452
There's a room in Giorgio's mansion.

06:03.454 --> 06:05.554
Only he and his sister have the key.

06:05.556 --> 06:07.490
There are files inside, log books,

06:07.492 --> 06:10.689
mostly written in code,
but in one of the books

06:10.692 --> 06:14.730
there was one phrase
written over and over...

06:14.732 --> 06:16.098
"Sent to lab."

06:16.100 --> 06:17.366
Vellek's lab.

06:17.368 --> 06:19.068
We find the lab, we find him.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.569
Enough.

06:20.571 --> 06:24.140
This man's lunatic army

06:24.142 --> 06:25.875
killed dozens of our people at Rota.

06:25.877 --> 06:27.877
His Greek warship tried to sink us.

06:27.879 --> 06:30.246
And now they're actively hunting
us in waters where we have

06:30.248 --> 06:32.125
dwindling supplies and zero support.

06:32.128 --> 06:36.185
- Captain, we're...
- The seeds are in hand.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.454
And we have orders from the
National Command Authority

06:38.456 --> 06:40.389
to get them back to
the States post haste.

06:40.391 --> 06:42.324
We'll make post at
Naples in eight hours.

06:42.326 --> 06:44.393
The C-130 out of Ramstein
will meet us there

06:44.395 --> 06:47.190
to fly the seeds home,
where our scientists

06:47.193 --> 06:48.559
can get to work on them.

06:48.562 --> 06:49.985
That is our mission.

06:51.569 --> 06:52.902
Understood.

06:52.904 --> 06:54.134
That is all.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.912
Captain, a word?

07:02.914 --> 07:07.650
Since you seem so keen
on joining our fight...

07:07.652 --> 07:10.586
Every active ship in the fleet
has a copy of these orders.

07:10.588 --> 07:13.889
This is a full Presidential pardon

07:13.891 --> 07:16.459
for any crimes you may have committed

07:16.461 --> 07:18.582
during the recent Constitutional crisis.

07:20.731 --> 07:24.433
This reactivates your commission,

07:24.435 --> 07:27.903
reinstituting you to the
active duty rank of Captain.

07:29.774 --> 07:32.074
All that's required now

07:32.076 --> 07:34.743
is your signature.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.712
And you taking the oath again.

07:39.383 --> 07:41.484
I left this ship for a reason.

07:41.486 --> 07:44.320
And yet somehow, here you are.

07:45.890 --> 07:48.290
This ship will always be your
home as far as I'm concerned.

07:48.292 --> 07:50.159
But I won't lie to you...

07:50.161 --> 07:53.795
Master Chief has reported some
mixed emotions from the crew

07:53.798 --> 07:55.430
at having you back.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.467
So for clarity and morale,

07:58.469 --> 08:01.036
you need to decide one way or the other,

08:01.038 --> 08:02.471
and soon.

08:08.913 --> 08:11.447
Vellek went to too much
trouble to get those seeds.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.815
No way he gives up now.

08:12.817 --> 08:15.264
His destroyer's out
there, hunting for us.

08:15.267 --> 08:19.288
Now we just need to get to
Naples before he finds us.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.891
Sasha, what do you think about the idea,

08:21.893 --> 08:24.426
going after Vellek,
forcing him to work with us?

08:24.428 --> 08:25.895
You're serious?

08:25.897 --> 08:28.324
My brother had to evacuate
his family from London.

08:28.327 --> 08:30.295
Neighbors were killing each
other over scraps of food.

08:30.297 --> 08:32.496
At this point, who cares
where the help comes from?

08:32.500 --> 08:34.166
I hear you.

08:36.073 --> 08:37.506
I do.

08:37.508 --> 08:40.241
But Vellek is not the answer.

08:40.244 --> 08:42.645
He was run out of the
States for a reason.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.581
There's no proof he can
actually do what he advertises.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.850
What he has proven is
that he'll kill anyone

08:47.852 --> 08:50.019
and everyone to get what he wants.

08:50.021 --> 08:51.620
It's a crazy idea.

08:51.622 --> 08:53.589
Tom Chandler didn't seem to think so.

08:59.876 --> 09:03.310
I can't imagine what
you're feeling right now,

09:03.313 --> 09:05.066
seeing him after all this time.

09:07.605 --> 09:10.239
What I'm feeling is
that we have the seeds.

09:10.241 --> 09:12.025
We just need to get them to Naples.

09:12.028 --> 09:13.819
Then, if it comes to it,

09:13.822 --> 09:16.470
we'll deal with Mad Doctor Vellek...

09:16.473 --> 09:18.273
on our terms.

09:21.788 --> 09:24.153
Sometimes he's lucid.

09:24.155 --> 09:28.490
Sometimes his eyes glaze over
and he goes... somewhere else.

09:28.492 --> 09:30.626
Do you think he was dosed
with the hallucinogen

09:30.628 --> 09:32.928
you saw people taking in Greece? Nostos?

09:32.930 --> 09:36.265
A weed that was changed by the virus.

09:36.267 --> 09:38.567
Vlita, Lucia called it.

09:38.569 --> 09:41.303
Vlita. That'll help.

09:44.075 --> 09:46.208
He'll be fine, sir.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.010
And he'll be glad to see ya.

09:52.116 --> 09:53.983
His eyes were all glassy.

09:53.985 --> 09:56.952
It was like he didn't see
the bullets whizzing past us.

09:56.954 --> 09:59.421
Talking about someone named Christine.

09:59.423 --> 10:01.190
Is that his daughter?

10:01.192 --> 10:03.225
I think she's his wife.

10:03.227 --> 10:07.196
All I know is the CO is
definitely on something.

10:07.199 --> 10:10.100
I just wish someone would
tell us what's goin' on.

10:36.966 --> 10:38.466
We're fine.

10:38.469 --> 10:40.599
Cali stops by every day
with something to eat,

10:40.602 --> 10:42.735
and I'm working at the pier now.

10:42.737 --> 10:45.438
It's okay, Dad. Don't
worry. We got this.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.006
You're starting to sound like me.

10:47.008 --> 10:50.042
Yeah, I guess the
apple doesn't fall far.

10:50.044 --> 10:52.478
How are you?

10:52.480 --> 10:55.181
I'm good, Ash.

10:55.183 --> 10:57.083
I'm good.

10:57.085 --> 11:00.634
You're back on Nathan James, though.

11:00.637 --> 11:02.971
Yeah...

11:02.974 --> 11:06.142
I'm back. For now.

11:06.145 --> 11:08.384
A sailor belongs at sea.

11:10.098 --> 11:12.765
Listen, Ash, I can't talk long
and there's a lot I can't say,

11:12.767 --> 11:14.700
but I need you to know,

11:14.702 --> 11:16.669
I'll finish this thing and come home

11:16.671 --> 11:18.738
to you and your brother
as soon as I possibly can.

11:18.740 --> 11:21.173
I know, Dad. We under...

11:21.175 --> 11:22.975
Ashley?

11:25.339 --> 11:27.418
I can try to raise them again, Sir.

11:30.618 --> 11:32.118
We said what we needed to.

11:34.188 --> 11:37.657
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Anytime, Sir.

11:37.659 --> 11:41.861
It wasn't like any acid
trip I'd ever heard of.

11:41.863 --> 11:44.759
No. It was more like time travel.

11:46.712 --> 11:48.728
Everything about it was real.

11:50.939 --> 11:54.006
The smell of her perfume,

11:54.008 --> 11:56.087
the softness of my kids' hair.

11:59.747 --> 12:04.183
Seeing them, all of us together again...

12:04.185 --> 12:08.521
Oh, it was perfect.

12:11.593 --> 12:14.694
And just like that, they were gone.

12:16.331 --> 12:19.498
I'd lost them again.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.973
And the wound was re-opened.

12:23.071 --> 12:26.505
But it was worse this
time, because I had 'em.

12:26.507 --> 12:28.363
I had 'em, Russ.

12:30.645 --> 12:32.311
I was home.

12:33.615 --> 12:36.749
But you have to
remember, it wasn't real.

12:36.751 --> 12:38.009
It's the drug.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.890
What if someone told you
that you could go back?

12:44.892 --> 12:49.028
Pick a time and a place,
see your wife and kids.

12:49.030 --> 12:51.263
Wouldn't you be curious to try?

12:57.472 --> 13:00.406
Lieutenant, getting something
coming on channel 1-6.

13:02.877 --> 13:06.078
Mayday, Mayday, our engines are failing.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.489
CIC, Comms, we're picking up

13:07.492 --> 13:09.849
a transmission over
VHF emergency channel.

13:09.851 --> 13:12.151
Possible distress call.

13:12.153 --> 13:14.854
There are 28 aboard my vessel.

13:14.856 --> 13:16.956
Many are sick, we have no food...

13:16.958 --> 13:18.724
Can you get a bearing on them?

13:18.726 --> 13:20.192
Calculating bearing, aye.

13:20.194 --> 13:21.794
I say again, this is the trawler,

13:21.796 --> 13:23.963
El Alamein, requesting assistance.

13:23.965 --> 13:25.431
I've got the transmission.

13:25.433 --> 13:29.168
Bearing 1-1-8, detecting
an S-band radar signature.

13:29.170 --> 13:30.503
Classifying it now.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.805
We're still tracking, but
we haven't yet responded

13:32.807 --> 13:34.840
to their distress call.

13:41.649 --> 13:43.749
Captain. Sir.

13:43.751 --> 13:45.851
Gator.

13:45.853 --> 13:47.253
Good to see you.

13:47.255 --> 13:50.756
CIC, Bridge. Can you confirm ship ID?

13:50.758 --> 13:52.758
They're beyond our range of visibility.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.527
With the CO under the weather,

13:54.529 --> 13:59.498
Captain Meylan would appreciate
your expertise close by.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.933
Happy to help.

14:00.935 --> 14:03.002
S-Band is a commercial
navigation radar.

14:03.004 --> 14:04.789
AIS reports they're a
commercial fishing vessel.

14:04.791 --> 14:07.473
Intermittent engine noise. Spin off
their prop suggests a small vessel

14:07.475 --> 14:09.631
- with engine trouble.
- Course and speed reported

14:09.634 --> 14:12.078
concurs with what we're seeing on radar.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.147
Bridge, TAO. Small,
probably commercial vessel.

14:15.149 --> 14:17.098
Barely approaching 3 knots.

14:17.101 --> 14:19.350
Bearing 1-1-8, 28 miles.

14:19.353 --> 14:21.887
That's opposite direction of
our course toward Naples, Sir.

14:21.889 --> 14:24.090
So aside from our usual
concern of pirates,

14:24.092 --> 14:27.259
we now have to consider this
could be a trap set by Vellek.

14:27.261 --> 14:28.394
Even if it's not a trap,

14:28.396 --> 14:30.763
his warship is in the
area looking for us.

14:30.765 --> 14:32.398
He could've heard our broadcast.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.632
You're still itching for a
confrontation with Vellek.

14:34.635 --> 14:36.669
You made your call. I respect it.

14:38.973 --> 14:42.308
Even if this is a
legitimate distress call,

14:42.310 --> 14:44.910
our obligation to render
aid cannot apply here.

14:44.912 --> 14:46.712
Our mission is to get
the seeds to Naples

14:46.714 --> 14:48.714
or millions are gonna die.

14:48.716 --> 14:50.296
What would you do?

14:53.755 --> 14:56.088
This crew can execute VBSS rescue

14:56.090 --> 14:57.690
better than any ship at sea.

14:57.692 --> 14:59.225
To that, I can personally attest.

14:59.227 --> 15:01.794
There's no way to eliminate the risks,

15:01.796 --> 15:04.163
but saving lives is saving lives.

15:10.905 --> 15:14.240
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

15:14.242 --> 15:16.942
El Alamein, this is the...

15:18.546 --> 15:20.112
trawler, Fisherking.

15:20.114 --> 15:22.348
Yes, yes! I'm hearing you, Fisherking.

15:22.350 --> 15:24.383
- Go ahead, please.
- We have your location.

15:24.385 --> 15:28.120
Sit tight. We'll be
with you in the hour.

15:28.122 --> 15:29.488
Thank you, Fisherking.

15:29.490 --> 15:32.124
Thank you! Thank God. Thank God.

15:32.126 --> 15:34.359
Y'alla, Y'alla, they're coming!

15:49.596 --> 15:52.256
XO, starboard RHIB is away.

15:52.259 --> 15:53.825
Very well.

15:53.828 --> 15:56.402
I hold the trawler DIW,
slight drift to port.

15:56.404 --> 15:59.138
Recommend slowing to 2 knots
to maintain 4,000 yards CPA.

15:59.140 --> 16:01.107
Roger. Helmsman, steady as she goes.

16:01.109 --> 16:03.910
All engines ahead one third for 2 knots.

16:10.410 --> 16:13.578
Mother, Vulture Team, this is Sunshine.

16:13.588 --> 16:15.488
I have the trawler in sight.

16:15.490 --> 16:18.591
Appears DIW. Will confirm.

16:18.593 --> 16:20.259
Light her up.

16:31.072 --> 16:32.939
Master Chief, hail the trawler.

16:32.941 --> 16:34.974
Tell them to get everyone above deck.

16:34.976 --> 16:38.644
El Alamein, this is
U.S. Navy warship 1-5-1,

16:38.646 --> 16:42.181
4,000 yards off your port
bow. We are here to help.

16:42.183 --> 16:44.417
Muster your crew and passengers topside.

16:44.419 --> 16:47.653
Everyone must sit on deck
with their hands visible.

16:47.655 --> 16:49.388
Yes, we understand.

16:49.390 --> 16:53.793
Y'alla. Y'alla. Andiamo.
Andiamo, let's go.

16:55.163 --> 16:57.363
That boat's definitely ridin' low.

16:57.365 --> 16:58.865
They're takin' on water.

16:58.867 --> 17:01.100
Or it's weighed down by explosives.

17:01.102 --> 17:04.570
We take no chances. They are
hostile till we see otherwise.

17:04.574 --> 17:07.342
Vulture Team, deck is not fouled.

17:07.345 --> 17:09.008
You are clear to approach.

17:09.010 --> 17:11.676
Recommend boarding portside.

17:11.679 --> 17:13.246
Copy, Sunshine.

17:13.248 --> 17:15.748
Approach from the stern, portside!

17:30.265 --> 17:32.565
Portside's clear. Go ahead, go ahead.

17:32.567 --> 17:36.102
Back up! Back up! Back
up! Back up! Back up!

17:38.006 --> 17:42.308
Back up! Back up! Stay back!

17:42.310 --> 17:47.180
Steady. Keep her
steady. Keep her steady.

17:47.182 --> 17:51.551
Hands up! Sit down!
Stay where I can see you.

17:55.590 --> 17:57.046
Step aside.

17:59.928 --> 18:02.328
Get down! Easy, easy.

18:02.330 --> 18:05.531
U.S. Navy, okay? We're here to help you.

18:05.533 --> 18:07.867
Everybody back.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.570
Everybody down!

18:10.572 --> 18:12.672
Hands up, hands up.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.607
You, move over there.

18:16.868 --> 18:18.845
- Sit down where you are.
- Back up, back up.

18:21.082 --> 18:23.850
Get down, get down, down! You, sit down!

18:27.288 --> 18:30.056
- Down! You two, down!
- Raise your hand!

18:31.559 --> 18:35.461
It's okay, we're here
to help. Come on now.

18:35.463 --> 18:36.929
Okay, come.

18:36.931 --> 18:38.130
- Hands.
- Slow.

18:38.132 --> 18:40.466
Turn. Slow. Right there.

18:41.936 --> 18:43.402
Search them.

18:44.772 --> 18:47.940
It's okay. Keep your hands up.

18:47.942 --> 18:49.675
Show me your hands.
You hiding something?

18:51.946 --> 18:53.479
Hands, hands!

18:54.716 --> 18:56.015
Thank you for responding...

18:56.017 --> 18:57.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! Hands!

18:57.552 --> 19:00.553
- Down! Sit down!
- I am the master of this vessel.

19:00.555 --> 19:01.921
Sit down!

19:01.923 --> 19:04.690
Stay down. Right there.

19:04.692 --> 19:06.859
Arms up.

19:06.861 --> 19:09.061
- Hey!
- Come!

19:11.432 --> 19:13.948
What happened?!

19:13.951 --> 19:16.369
- I'm sorry! I tried to warn him!
- You okay?

19:16.371 --> 19:17.904
Weapon! I found a weapon!

19:17.906 --> 19:19.705
Weapon? Weapon! Weapon!

19:24.178 --> 19:26.279
What are they saying?
What are they saying?

19:26.281 --> 19:28.781
Shut them up. Shut them up!

19:28.783 --> 19:31.384
Shut them up! Shut them up!

19:31.386 --> 19:35.221
Hey!

19:35.223 --> 19:38.024
Hey, sit down! Get down, goddamn it!

19:38.026 --> 19:40.059
You stay down.

19:40.061 --> 19:42.828
Everybody stay down!

19:42.830 --> 19:44.297
Hey, hey!

19:44.299 --> 19:45.698
- Down!
- Hey, stay down!

19:45.700 --> 19:47.533
Down! Stay down!

19:50.471 --> 19:51.938
Don't move!

19:57.745 --> 19:59.412
Get down, goddamn it!

19:59.414 --> 20:01.314
Stay down!

20:01.316 --> 20:03.849
- Check these people.
- It's okay. They're just people.

20:03.851 --> 20:05.855
I said check them, PO1. Do it!

20:05.858 --> 20:09.021
Hey, hey!

20:09.023 --> 20:10.456
She's got something in her hands.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.058
She's hiding something.

20:12.060 --> 20:14.327
What's she got in her
hands? What's she got?

20:14.329 --> 20:16.529
It's a child. It's just a child.

20:20.068 --> 20:21.334
Doc, we're clear!

20:21.336 --> 20:22.969
- Clear.
- Clear!

20:22.971 --> 20:26.205
Clear.

20:26.207 --> 20:29.508
Burk.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.814
Clear.

20:34.816 --> 20:38.084
Let's go, Doc! Wolf, see if
this tub's really sinking.

20:42.924 --> 20:44.256
Good job, guys.

20:44.258 --> 20:46.592
All clear, all clear.

20:46.594 --> 20:49.261
Medical team is boarding the vessel.

20:49.263 --> 20:53.532
Let me take a look there.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.407
We can't do much for them here.

20:59.410 --> 21:01.407
They need food,
hydration, and antibiotics.

21:01.409 --> 21:04.977
Vessel's got no water
integrity. She's gonna sink.

21:04.979 --> 21:09.415
We have to bring 'em back.

21:09.417 --> 21:11.217
Burk!

21:18.418 --> 21:20.184
Mother, we have 28 PAX.

21:20.194 --> 21:22.595
Many sick and injured. Vessel is FUBAR.

21:22.597 --> 21:24.196
Permission to bring them aboard

21:24.198 --> 21:26.165
for additional medical assistance.

21:26.167 --> 21:29.168
Roger. Begin transferring
PAX back to Mother.

21:29.170 --> 21:30.703
We're sending out the second RHIB.

21:45.553 --> 21:47.887
Once our guests are aboard,
resume course for Naples.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.688
Yes, sir.

21:50.758 --> 21:54.060
This is taking too much of our time.

22:15.969 --> 22:17.535
_

22:18.670 --> 22:19.629
_

22:19.630 --> 22:23.170
_

22:25.014 --> 22:28.707
_

22:28.746 --> 22:29.723
_

22:29.761 --> 22:30.583
_

22:38.238 --> 22:40.505
Here you go, son.

22:41.057 --> 22:42.455
_

22:42.502 --> 22:43.946
_

23:05.165 --> 23:07.231
Anyone look familiar, Sir?

23:07.233 --> 23:10.201
None of these people work for Giorgio.

23:10.203 --> 23:11.869
And Omar's guys are better fed.

23:11.871 --> 23:13.971
They were headed north looking for food.

23:13.973 --> 23:16.629
I didn't have the heart to tell
them it's the same everywhere.

23:28.388 --> 23:31.255
Kathleen, I wanted to say...

23:34.294 --> 23:36.761
I'm sorry.

23:36.763 --> 23:39.997
I should've come to
you after your dad died,

23:39.999 --> 23:41.699
told you what happened myself.

23:41.701 --> 23:43.101
I...

23:43.104 --> 23:45.336
I didn't have the words.

23:45.338 --> 23:47.438
I hope you haven't spent
the last year and a half

23:47.440 --> 23:50.028
agonizing over this, because I haven't.

23:51.751 --> 23:55.119
Tex saved my life.

23:55.122 --> 23:57.448
And it wasn't the first time.

23:57.450 --> 24:00.151
I owed you more.

24:00.153 --> 24:02.053
Yeah, well,

24:02.055 --> 24:04.555
you know what my old
man would say to that?

24:05.692 --> 24:07.959
Get over yourself, Commodore.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.562
I've got work.

24:17.003 --> 24:19.124
Hey, I checked those people already.

24:19.127 --> 24:21.272
I'm checking again.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.275
Let me see yours. Open it up.

24:24.277 --> 24:26.544
Hey, man, if you need some
time, we got you covered.

24:26.546 --> 24:27.779
Why would I need time?

24:27.781 --> 24:29.614
I know if my brother were hurt...

24:29.616 --> 24:30.915
This isn't about Cameron.

24:30.917 --> 24:32.717
Then what? What is going on with you?

24:32.719 --> 24:34.919
- Just leave it.
- I'm not gonna leave it.

24:34.921 --> 24:37.542
You can't bury this shit, Burk.

24:37.545 --> 24:38.956
Hey, talk to me.

24:38.958 --> 24:40.591
When are they gonna stop coming at us?

24:40.593 --> 24:42.593
When are we gonna know
who's really on our side

24:42.595 --> 24:44.762
and who's just waiting to
see where the chips fall, huh?

24:44.764 --> 24:46.898
I mean...

24:46.900 --> 24:50.501
even our skipper still
won't put on the uniform.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.811
Keep two guards at every door.

24:59.814 --> 25:04.015
Move 'em to the head in
shifts. No one gets in or out.

25:04.017 --> 25:05.349
Security update.

25:05.351 --> 25:07.418
Okay?

25:07.420 --> 25:10.288
Good. Good. Get some rest.

25:10.290 --> 25:12.051
So where's the CO?

25:12.054 --> 25:13.591
Moved back to his stateroom.

25:13.593 --> 25:15.326
I needed space for these people.

25:15.328 --> 25:16.595
Got you something.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.098
Found it on one of the refugees.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.097
Figured it must be the
same plant that the Captain

25:20.099 --> 25:21.532
got dosed with.

25:24.137 --> 25:25.937
Nostos.

25:28.174 --> 25:29.540
You figured right.

25:29.542 --> 25:31.934
I mean, why else smuggle
a bunch of weeds, right?

25:31.937 --> 25:34.745
- I was gonna dump it, but I figured...
- No, no, no, I'm glad you didn't.

25:34.747 --> 25:36.113
I need to run some tests,

25:36.115 --> 25:38.583
make sure there aren't
any toxic side effects.

25:43.756 --> 25:45.923
Could you escort her back
to the helo bay, please?

25:45.925 --> 25:48.659
Yeah, you got it. Miss, come on.

25:48.661 --> 25:50.658
- Shukran.
- Mm-hmm.

25:55.435 --> 25:57.768
Seeds are in good shape.

25:57.770 --> 26:01.439
C-130 will be on the tarmac in
Naples by the time we anchor.

26:01.441 --> 26:03.841
Ah. And how are the
new passengers doing?

26:03.843 --> 26:06.477
They'll be all right. Most
of them are just hungry.

26:09.816 --> 26:11.177
Yeah.

26:11.180 --> 26:12.984
A lot of that going around these days.

26:12.986 --> 26:14.652
Not for much longer, thanks to you.

26:14.654 --> 26:16.122
Can I help you find something?

26:17.790 --> 26:19.724
Doc Rios took my Cubans.

26:19.726 --> 26:22.727
He said the nicotine
would screw with the detox.

26:22.729 --> 26:25.263
I stashed one for emergencies somewhere.

26:25.265 --> 26:26.752
I'm not a doctor,

26:26.755 --> 26:29.556
but I think you've had enough
stimulants for the time being.

26:36.175 --> 26:37.742
I should've known.

26:37.744 --> 26:39.243
Halfway around the globe,

26:39.245 --> 26:42.280
we'd find you working
the same problem as us.

26:42.282 --> 26:45.616
Trying to save the world again.

26:45.618 --> 26:49.554
You know, 16 months, Tom.

26:49.556 --> 26:51.589
I was starting to think you were dead.

26:51.591 --> 26:53.190
Part of me was.

26:55.161 --> 26:56.961
Still fighting that battle?

26:58.197 --> 27:00.798
I saw a side of me, Mike...

27:00.800 --> 27:02.066
I thought I'd put it away,

27:02.068 --> 27:04.101
but it came back again in Greece.

27:04.103 --> 27:06.437
Vengeful,

27:06.439 --> 27:09.607
angry, and out of control.

27:09.609 --> 27:11.475
I didn't like it.

27:11.477 --> 27:13.544
Welcome to the human race.

27:15.648 --> 27:17.515
Or what's left of it.

27:22.388 --> 27:24.689
You know, when I was dosed...

27:26.059 --> 27:28.593
it wasn't just my family I saw.

27:30.663 --> 27:32.263
You were there, too.

27:36.135 --> 27:38.970
They're gone again, but
we're still here, you and me.

27:38.972 --> 27:41.606
That's gotta be worth something.

27:43.543 --> 27:45.576
You are here, right?

27:51.884 --> 27:54.418
I'm glad to see you're
feeling better, Mike.

27:56.769 --> 27:59.536
Ship needs her captain.

28:35.762 --> 28:38.229
Hello, Fletch.

28:39.666 --> 28:40.970
Hello, Harry.

28:50.514 --> 28:53.849
El Alamein. Very subtle.

28:53.851 --> 28:55.751
Figured it would ring a bell.

28:55.753 --> 28:58.454
"My grandpapa fought back
the Jerries in Egypt."

29:00.157 --> 29:01.890
You wouldn't shut up about it.

29:01.892 --> 29:03.759
We started to believe
you personally stood

29:03.761 --> 29:05.894
in front of Rommel's tanks.

29:05.896 --> 29:07.830
What do you want, Harry?

29:07.832 --> 29:10.432
I have a message from the River House.

29:10.434 --> 29:12.234
Could've telephoned.

29:12.236 --> 29:14.870
Couldn't take the risk our
cousins would decrypt it.

29:14.872 --> 29:16.605
Yeah. Sure.

29:16.607 --> 29:19.208
Okay. So?

29:19.210 --> 29:22.111
The special relationship
with the Americans is no more.

29:22.113 --> 29:24.346
The labs in the U.S. are
not prepared to work with

29:24.348 --> 29:25.848
the progenitor seed.

29:25.850 --> 29:27.116
The U.K. is going it alone.

29:27.118 --> 29:29.518
How? Our labs are worse than theirs.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.020
We found a scientist.

29:32.022 --> 29:35.190
Home office says he has
a lock on the science.

29:35.192 --> 29:38.894
Let me guess. This scientist...

29:38.896 --> 29:40.963
His name wouldn't happen to be Vellek?

29:42.299 --> 29:44.433
He reached out, made us an offer.

29:44.435 --> 29:46.935
We deliver the progenitor palm
seeds, and England receives

29:46.937 --> 29:48.904
the first batch of
plague-resistant crops.

29:48.906 --> 29:51.707
Our people will be fed.

29:51.709 --> 29:54.209
No waiting around like
we did for the cure.

29:54.211 --> 29:57.312
Where are the seeds?

29:57.314 --> 30:00.048
In the medical bay, under lock and...

30:00.050 --> 30:01.717
Under lock and key.

30:01.719 --> 30:04.052
Well, obviously I won't be
able to get anywhere near them,

30:04.054 --> 30:06.922
filthy refugee that I am.

30:06.924 --> 30:08.724
- You're gonna have to do it.
- Me?

30:08.726 --> 30:10.425
And find me a discreet
way off this ship.

30:10.427 --> 30:13.629
What do you mean, off the ship?
You're just gonna swim away?

30:13.631 --> 30:15.464
We're due in Naples. There's a plane.

30:15.466 --> 30:16.718
That's not happening, James.

30:16.721 --> 30:19.234
I leave with the seeds before
the ship gets to Naples.

30:19.236 --> 30:21.370
And what? I stay behind
to face a firing squad?

30:21.372 --> 30:23.710
No one will know your part.

30:23.713 --> 30:25.874
You'll remain on board to
throw them off the scent.

30:25.876 --> 30:27.109
Can't have the Americans

30:27.111 --> 30:28.343
starting a war with England over this.

30:28.345 --> 30:29.945
- This is ridiculous.
- Fletch...

30:29.947 --> 30:31.424
I've been working with
the Americans for months.

30:31.426 --> 30:32.811
Listen to me, it's quite simple.

30:32.814 --> 30:33.982
Their people have fought
and died for these seeds.

30:33.984 --> 30:36.118
And where were they during
the Immune wars, hmm?

30:36.120 --> 30:38.287
While they were spreading
the cure with kisses and love,

30:38.289 --> 30:40.389
we were massacred.

30:42.860 --> 30:44.827
We're dying at home, Fletch.

30:44.829 --> 30:47.029
I'm sorry about your new friends,

30:47.031 --> 30:49.164
but this is a good deal.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.999
It's a dog-eat-dog world now.

30:51.001 --> 30:54.670
Have you eaten dog yet, Fletch? I have.

30:54.672 --> 30:57.206
It's no fun.

31:03.860 --> 31:08.283
I shouldn't have to remind
you of your duty, Commander.

31:11.889 --> 31:14.656
This is U.S. 2-4-0 Alpha Tango.

31:14.658 --> 31:16.282
How's our ceiling at Naples?

31:16.285 --> 31:18.894
U.S. 2-4-0, beautiful day,

31:18.896 --> 31:20.629
clouds scattered below Angels One.

31:20.631 --> 31:24.700
Copy that, Navy Spear.
We're 109 mikes out.

31:24.702 --> 31:26.935
U.S. 2-4-0,

31:26.937 --> 31:29.805
your last was unreadable.
Say again, over.

31:31.809 --> 31:33.308
The C-130 just went silent.

31:33.310 --> 31:35.244
And now I've lost their transponder.

31:35.246 --> 31:37.613
Toss the satellite on Ka-Band.

31:37.615 --> 31:41.308
U.S. 2-4-0, we just lost
your IFF transmission.

31:41.311 --> 31:43.910
Recycle your mode C transponder, over.

31:47.391 --> 31:51.059
U.S. 2-4-0, nothing
heard. Please respond.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.081
There you are.

32:13.083 --> 32:14.983
I've been trying to track you down.

32:14.985 --> 32:17.219
What is it?

32:17.221 --> 32:19.254
Satellite captured this 20 minutes ago.

32:19.256 --> 32:21.657
There's no evidence of a
missile or other aircraft.

32:21.659 --> 32:23.592
But comms was pretty
spotty over the Apennines.

32:23.594 --> 32:26.161
Impact site is easily
within range of a standard

32:26.163 --> 32:29.331
missile fired from a
Hellenic Destroyer off Naples.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.365
Vellek.

32:30.367 --> 32:33.302
How the hell did he
know about our plane?

32:33.304 --> 32:36.338
The range ring for his
warship will be in this area.

32:36.340 --> 32:39.141
Which means we're likely
headed right towards him.

32:39.143 --> 32:42.678
Still think we should cut
a deal with this maniac?

32:42.680 --> 32:44.513
Are there any other
aircraft available to fly

32:44.515 --> 32:45.742
the seeds to the States?

32:45.745 --> 32:47.950
No, sir. All our bases
in Europe are down.

32:47.952 --> 32:49.918
Port of Haifa had a couple cargo planes,

32:49.920 --> 32:51.486
but they're no longer in service.

32:51.488 --> 32:53.555
Commander Fletcher,

32:53.557 --> 32:57.259
does the Royal Navy have
any assets it can scramble?

32:59.530 --> 33:01.396
Commander?

33:02.833 --> 33:05.567
Um, I'm afraid our Air
Force is nonexistent, Sir.

33:05.569 --> 33:07.736
What wasn't destroyed
during the Immune wars

33:07.738 --> 33:10.138
was grounded for lack
of fuel and pilots.

33:11.442 --> 33:13.408
All right.

33:13.410 --> 33:15.944
We'll deliver the seeds
to Norfolk ourselves.

33:15.946 --> 33:17.746
We'll make for Gibraltar.

33:17.748 --> 33:20.415
There's still fuel at Rota
and FOS Monrovia if needed.

33:20.417 --> 33:23.485
LHD Blackwood can come down
from the north with an unrep...

33:23.487 --> 33:26.488
We'll never make it out of the Med.

33:26.490 --> 33:29.391
Vellek expects Nathan
James to go for Gibraltar.

33:29.393 --> 33:32.160
You barely made it through
the gauntlet last time.

33:32.162 --> 33:34.529
By now, they've rebuilt their defenses.

33:34.531 --> 33:36.365
Then we'll go through the Red Sea.

33:36.367 --> 33:38.200
The locks in the Suez
haven't been operational

33:38.202 --> 33:40.302
- since the plague hit.
- Are you sure?

33:40.304 --> 33:41.870
I've been listening to ship traffic

33:41.872 --> 33:43.772
in that region for months.

33:43.774 --> 33:45.374
Then what do you suggest?

33:45.376 --> 33:48.677
Well, Giorgio likes
to fight, so we fight.

33:48.679 --> 33:51.880
They won't try to sink us as
long as we have what they want.

33:51.882 --> 33:54.010
And that gives us the advantage.

33:54.013 --> 33:55.412
We take the fight to them,

33:55.415 --> 33:57.352
clear the airspace for
another transport plane.

33:57.354 --> 34:00.155
Aegis Ashore out of Haifa
should be a good start.

34:00.157 --> 34:02.457
Meantime, we capture
Vellek and his research.

34:02.459 --> 34:04.273
- Again with this idea?
- It's our best shot.

34:04.276 --> 34:06.628
- I've already made the decision.
- Captured Nazis helped us build a bomb.

34:06.630 --> 34:10.665
Captain Chandler, you are still
just a passenger on this ship.

34:10.667 --> 34:13.235
If you really want to be
a part of the conversation,

34:13.237 --> 34:14.569
then put on the uniform.

34:14.571 --> 34:16.804
If not, let the
professionals do their job.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.239
Get St. Louis on the horn.

34:18.242 --> 34:20.108
Update the President
on our current CONOPS.

34:20.110 --> 34:22.010
- That is all.
- Aye, Sir.

34:26.683 --> 34:28.516
Captain Meylan's under
a lot of pressure.

34:28.518 --> 34:30.118
He was right. I crossed the line.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.487
I didn't say he wasn't right.

34:32.489 --> 34:33.966
This isn't you.

34:33.969 --> 34:36.158
Walking around the ship like
you're on a Tiger cruise.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.159
Since when did you
become a passive observer?

34:38.161 --> 34:39.074
Master Chief...

34:39.078 --> 34:42.065
Don't Master Chief me. Goddamn it.

34:45.101 --> 34:47.735
You wanted to get away. Good.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.237
It's what you did.

34:49.239 --> 34:51.239
God knows you of all
people needed a break.

34:51.241 --> 34:55.577
But for 16 months, the
rest of us pressed on.

34:55.579 --> 34:59.214
The missions changed, but
our commitment never wavered.

34:59.216 --> 35:01.450
And although you were
always in our minds,

35:01.452 --> 35:04.422
when you left, we were broken.

35:06.190 --> 35:08.056
I lost my way, Russ.

35:08.058 --> 35:10.659
You never lost your way.

35:10.661 --> 35:13.095
You may have turned your
back on your calling,

35:13.097 --> 35:16.431
but your path was always
right in front of you.

35:16.433 --> 35:19.000
It led you back to the Nathan James.

35:19.002 --> 35:21.636
This is where you belong.

35:59.095 --> 36:00.961
Come in.

36:16.002 --> 36:18.436
So you're back then?

36:20.673 --> 36:24.408
A good friend once told
me it was my destiny.

36:24.410 --> 36:25.876
And he's Greek, so he'd know.

36:25.878 --> 36:28.312
If I recall my history,
there was another Greek

36:28.314 --> 36:30.948
who said a man's character
determines his destiny.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.750
You chose this.

36:32.752 --> 36:36.254
I just need to see this through.

36:37.657 --> 36:40.157
Well, if it's a fight
you're looking for,

36:40.159 --> 36:42.093
you just might get it.

36:42.095 --> 36:44.061
We're staying put in the Med.

36:44.063 --> 36:46.697
We're gonna try to scramble
some assets in the Middle East.

36:46.699 --> 36:49.634
In the meantime, I'm
looking for a safe haven

36:49.636 --> 36:51.869
where we can drop off the refugees.

36:51.871 --> 36:54.805
Meylan made the recommendation
to the CNC, who concurred.

36:54.807 --> 36:56.607
And Vellek?

36:56.609 --> 36:59.076
Once the seeds are safely en route,

36:59.078 --> 37:01.345
he becomes the mission.

37:02.124 --> 37:04.915
Sounds like a plan. It was your plan.

37:04.917 --> 37:08.052
Meylan's his own man.

37:08.054 --> 37:09.584
How do I look?

37:19.258 --> 37:21.859
Better.

37:21.862 --> 37:23.695
Still need a haircut.

37:27.974 --> 37:30.941
All that time you were away,

37:30.943 --> 37:33.477
you find the peace you were looking for?

37:35.014 --> 37:37.615
There were moments.

37:37.617 --> 37:40.785
Moments?

37:40.787 --> 37:42.386
Sounds nice.

38:03.876 --> 38:06.143
It's me, Lucas, your son.

38:06.145 --> 38:08.779
I know you said you'd be
home before Thanksgiving,

38:08.781 --> 38:12.483
but I wrote this "porem"...
poem for you just in case.

38:12.485 --> 38:15.720
Dear God, I give thanks
to you for my pretty mom

38:15.722 --> 38:17.588
and thanks for my brave dad.

38:17.590 --> 38:19.557
I give thanks for both my sisters

38:19.559 --> 38:21.559
and all the good times we've had.

38:21.561 --> 38:23.594
I give thanks for my best friend, Ron,

38:23.596 --> 38:25.663
except for when he's weird and quirky.

38:25.665 --> 38:27.365
But the thing I'm most thankful for

38:27.367 --> 38:29.166
is not being born a turkey.

38:29.168 --> 38:32.670
Happy Thanksgiving. I love you, Dad.

38:40.546 --> 38:42.847
Love you, too, buddy.

38:49.288 --> 38:51.322
Attention to oath.

38:52.925 --> 38:55.659
Raise your hand and repeat after me.

38:57.363 --> 38:59.263
I, Thomas W. Chandler...

38:59.265 --> 39:01.465
I, Thomas W. Chandler...

39:01.467 --> 39:02.767
having been appointed an officer

39:02.769 --> 39:05.569
in the Navy of the United
States of America...

39:05.571 --> 39:07.138
having been appointed an officer

39:07.140 --> 39:09.206
in the Navy of the United
States of America...

39:09.208 --> 39:12.076
do solemnly swear that
I will support and defend

39:12.078 --> 39:14.211
the Constitution of the United States...

I will support and defend

39:16.716 --> 39:19.049

foreign or domestic.

39:21.187 --> 39:23.687
Against all enemies,
foreign or domestic.

39:23.689 --> 39:26.424
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

39:26.426 --> 39:29.460
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

39:29.462 --> 39:31.629
And that I will well and faithfully...

39:31.631 --> 39:33.631
And that I will well and faithfully...

39:33.633 --> 39:35.399
discharge the duties of the office

39:35.401 --> 39:37.101

39:37.103 --> 39:39.036

39:39.038 --> 39:41.154

39:42.392 --> 39:43.990
So help me God.

39:45.919 --> 39:47.490
And salute.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.056
Congratulations, Captain.

39:55.564 --> 39:57.597
Welcome back.

40:05.031 --> 40:06.464
Sir.

40:13.873 --> 40:15.639
You ever find yourself in a Navy bar,

40:15.641 --> 40:17.641
that'll earn you a free drink.

40:24.150 --> 40:25.783
Thank you, Diaz.

40:46.873 --> 40:50.608
28 refugees from 7 countries.

40:50.610 --> 40:52.209
Or what used to be countries.

40:52.211 --> 40:55.446
Any place we take them will be a relief.

40:55.448 --> 40:58.249
Assuming there's food.

40:58.251 --> 41:01.352
Let's just hope we don't
cross paths with Vellek first.

41:01.354 --> 41:04.358
We'll manage. Like always.

41:06.758 --> 41:09.158
Keep calm and carry on.

41:09.161 --> 41:10.761
That's my Fletch.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.139
Never a dull day on Nathan James.

41:25.381 --> 41:28.315
That's for sure.
