-JT: Looks like our victim

12:39.759 --> 12:40.760
already filled out her profile.

12:40.803 --> 12:41.935
She was looking to bang.

12:41.978 --> 12:43.371
Bang?

12:43.414 --> 12:45.590
Do you always associate
intercourse with violence?

12:45.634 --> 12:47.897
Bro, right now you're the only
thing I'm associating...

12:47.941 --> 12:50.030
Let him work.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.300
What's the matter?

12:59.343 --> 13:01.955
Nothing.
It's kind of my thing.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.000
I imagine the crime
from the killer's point of view.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.915
Helps me understand
his state of mind.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.612
You think like the killer?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.614
It's a gift.

13:09.658 --> 13:13.009
Well, you're right, Jeffy.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.794
It's JT.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.839
Our victim was waiting
for someone special.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.536
A lover.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.799
Unfortunately,
the wrong man showed up.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.849
She threw her champagne glass
the moment she saw him.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.895
She wasn't expecting
our killer.

13:28.938 --> 13:32.420
The fight was contained,
and he subdued her quickly.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.075
But how did he do it?

13:41.298 --> 13:43.474
She bit her tongue.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.825
He injected her with something.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.087
Probably a paralytic drug,

13:47.130 --> 13:49.959
trapping her in her own body.

13:50.003 --> 13:52.483
She had to feel everything.

13:52.527 --> 13:55.922
Inducing paralysis is
a thousand times harder

13:55.965 --> 13:57.227
than knocking someone out.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.275
It requires practice,

14:01.318 --> 14:04.017
equipment...

14:05.932 --> 14:07.150
...medical skills.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.892
What is it?

14:09.936 --> 14:11.894
I've seen this before.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.947
[sighs]

14:20.990 --> 14:22.992
There'll be an injection point
into her iliac crest,

14:23.036 --> 14:24.341
and a third near her heart.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.954
How the hell do you know that?

14:30.260 --> 14:32.088
Our killer's a copycat.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.049
He's mimicking
another serial killer.

14:38.529 --> 14:41.706
Dr. Martin Whitly.
The Surgeon.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.100
DANI:
Yeah?

14:44.144 --> 14:46.102
And you know all about
this Surgeon guy?

14:47.451 --> 14:49.323
Almost like he's family.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.330
GIL:
Bright, you okay?

14:56.373 --> 14:58.941
I worried about bringing you in.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.901
Didn't want to wake up
any old demons,

15:01.944 --> 15:04.033
but I had to be certain
that he was copying your dad.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.557
Don't worry,
my demons don't sleep.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.473
Look, I can only imagine
what you must be feeling.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.171
The killer is copying
The Quartet.

15:11.214 --> 15:14.043
A series of four murders
my father committed in '92.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.044
We've only had three.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.828
The killer isn't finished.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.358
Have you spoken to him?

15:24.401 --> 15:26.360
[sighs]:
No. No.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.101
Not in ten years.

15:28.144 --> 15:31.060
And I can't go back there, Gil.
I can't go back to him.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.541
No... it wasn't
a healthy relationship.

15:33.584 --> 15:37.110
I'm not asking you to...
but I got a serial killer

15:37.153 --> 15:39.112
on my hands, and you're
telling me he's not done.

15:43.116 --> 15:47.076
Okay, I'll get started
on a profile.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.739
[metallic clinking]

15:57.782 --> 16:00.960
-[Sunshine chirping]
-BRIGHT: Hello?

16:03.092 --> 16:05.138
[rapid chirping]

16:13.320 --> 16:15.104
Hello, Mother.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.236
Malcolm.

16:16.279 --> 16:18.107
I'm sorry I didn't call. I...

16:18.151 --> 16:20.109
Ainsley told me you were fired.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.068
Hallelujah.
Finally you can be done

16:22.111 --> 16:24.635
with all this
morose profiling nonsense.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.420
Yes, I will no longer
be dragging

16:26.463 --> 16:28.117
our family's sterling name
through the mud.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.292
Oh, stop it.

16:29.336 --> 16:32.165
Bright--
what a ridiculous alias.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.993
At least I have the decency to
drink through our family's ruin

16:34.036 --> 16:35.646
and not hide from it.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.953
-Turns out that's impossible.
-So...

16:37.997 --> 16:39.389
your loft.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.174
I had Luisa change out
your sheets

16:41.217 --> 16:42.436
and wipe down your restraints.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.133
And I called your old therapist,
Doctor...

16:44.177 --> 16:48.137
Mother, it is lovely to see you,
but I have things to do, and...

16:48.181 --> 16:49.573
I know you're not sleeping.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.401
[Bright sighs]

16:59.148 --> 17:00.236
Chamomile should help.

17:01.281 --> 17:04.110
And if it doesn't, I have pills.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.634
Relax, they're practically
over the counter.

17:06.677 --> 17:10.203
I have anxiety meds
and mood stabilizers.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.857
Even some quaaludes,
stashed from the '80s.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.381
Though I would rather not
share those

17:14.424 --> 17:16.165
unless it's really an emergency

17:16.209 --> 17:17.819
or a very good cocktail party.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.256
I'm afraid pills alone will not
fix what is wrong with us.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.476
If you take enough, they will.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.914
How I've missed our talks.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.698
Oh, I'm having your sister over
tomorrow night

17:27.742 --> 17:30.223
for a petite soiree;
be a dear and join.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.355
I'm assuming you don't break
into Ainsley's place like this?

17:32.399 --> 17:35.663
God, no. She's perfect.
You are my only concern.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.099
[giggles]

17:37.143 --> 17:38.927
Try the tea.
It'll help.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.408
Oh, yeah?
What's it laced with?

17:41.451 --> 17:43.801
Love.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.851
[sighs]:
Okay, let's get to work.

18:09.436 --> 18:12.308
[takes deep breath]

18:27.454 --> 18:28.716
Edrisa,

18:28.759 --> 18:30.761
thanks for hustling on this.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.676
-I know these homicides were...
-Amazing.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.548
I mean, I've only ever
read about

18:34.591 --> 18:36.289
The Surgeon's methods
in textbooks.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.247
To see them carried out
in person is a real thrill.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.641
So, three victims.
Based on the tox report,

18:40.684 --> 18:42.686
each one was injected
with a different cocktail

18:42.730 --> 18:44.514
of paralytic agents
that shut their bodies down

18:44.558 --> 18:46.342
one system at a time.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.735
-It must have been agony.
-BRIGHT: It was.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.218
I imagine.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.742
I have a preliminary profile.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.787
GIL:
Damn, Bright, you sleep at all?

18:56.831 --> 18:58.702
I got six hours,
three nights ago,

18:58.746 --> 19:01.401
so... yeah, I'm good.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.142
He's the killer, right?
We agree?

19:03.185 --> 19:04.317
BRIGHT:
Wow.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.014
This suture work is amazing.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.364
These Y-incisions.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.497
You're like Picasso
with formaldehyde.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.369
Thanks.
[chuckles]

19:13.413 --> 19:16.285
And you're... very slender.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.331
Yeah, well, most food
makes me sick.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.810
What's happening?

19:19.854 --> 19:21.464
Bright, your profile have
a headline?

19:21.508 --> 19:24.337
Our suspect is
a serial killer superfan.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.557
Probably white male.
Big surprise.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.168
He blends in.

19:29.211 --> 19:32.345
Average size,
average height, and smart.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.129
He's a high-functioning
psychopath.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.609
Hmm. Sounds like my ex.

19:35.652 --> 19:38.307
-He's also inadequate.
-Definitely Khalil.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.570
He can't craft his own murders,
so he mimics The Surgeon.

19:40.614 --> 19:44.400
His victims are white,
over 40, and wealthy.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.489
They're also strangers.
Nothing connects them.

19:46.533 --> 19:49.318
Except for these.

19:49.362 --> 19:52.539
All three victims had the same
bruising on their wrists.

19:52.582 --> 19:55.585
This does not match
The Surgeon's methods.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.065
Maybe our guy
handcuffed Vanessa?

19:57.108 --> 19:59.023
These aren't from metal.

19:59.067 --> 20:03.202
My guess is quarter-inch-thick
Japanese-style bondage rope.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.465
-Simple but effective.
-[chuckles]: Exactly.

20:05.508 --> 20:08.772
I mean, I agree about the rope
and its effectiveness,

20:08.816 --> 20:10.557
and, and everything else
that you said.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.255
Also, these bruises don't match
the time of death.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.822
They're from earlier.
Three days at least.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.389
So, the women were
all restrained,

20:16.432 --> 20:18.042
but not on the night
that they were murdered.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.871
They were into a Fifty Shades
type thing, I got you.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.396
So, we have three victims,
all exhibiting bruising

20:23.439 --> 20:25.006
consistent with BDSM.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.964
What if the man that Vanessa was
waiting for was a dom?

20:27.008 --> 20:29.053
A professional dominant.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.012
-He was seeing
all three of them.
-Right.

20:31.055 --> 20:32.579
If he's a pro, that means
that they paid him.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.450
I'll track down
the bank records.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.670
Nico Stavros.
He lives in apartment 5J.

20:36.713 --> 20:39.586
Each victim sent him a payment
in the last month.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.414
NYPD!

20:42.806 --> 20:44.243
Lights are off.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.245
Gil said to wait.
He's pulling a warrant.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.900
-You calling Gil?
-No. Nico.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.859
His number was in the file.

20:51.902 --> 20:54.383
Maybe he's available
for a quick session.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.037

20:56.080 --> 20:58.082

20:58.126 --> 20:59.519
[ringing stops]

20:59.562 --> 21:01.260
I think he's home.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.871
NYPD!

21:05.829 --> 21:07.527
Clear.

21:08.615 --> 21:09.659
Clear!

21:13.837 --> 21:15.361
Clear.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.669
DANI:
What is this?

21:19.713 --> 21:22.237
JT:
What the hell, man?

21:22.281 --> 21:25.806
He's building electronics.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.938
Compounding his own drugs.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.549
He's more than a copycat.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.727
-My profile's wrong.
-[groaning nearby]

21:37.731 --> 21:40.429
[muffled groaning continues]

21:46.696 --> 21:48.350
NYPD. Don't worry.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.482
You're okay.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.093
He's here?

21:54.443 --> 21:55.618
-DANI: NYPD!

-[grunts]
-[whimpers]

22:12.679 --> 22:14.898
Why did Nico do this to you?
Were you one of his clients?

22:14.942 --> 22:17.510
I'm not a client, man.
I'm Nico.

22:17.553 --> 22:19.338
He made me call them.
Set up dates.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.687
He's a psycho, man.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.732
I got a 10-13, armed perp
at 1901 Riverside.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.038
Officer in pursuit.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.475
Hey, stop!

22:26.519 --> 22:28.172
-Who did this to you?
-I didn't see his face.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.784
Please, I've been in this chair
for days. Get me out!

22:33.787 --> 22:36.442
-Yo, he's locked in.
-JT.

22:36.485 --> 22:37.834
Little problem here.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.185
Oh, man, that ain't good.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.588
[phone beeps]

22:53.546 --> 22:55.330
-Bright, you see that?
-Yeah.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.158
It's a bomb,
and he's locked to it,

22:57.201 --> 22:58.768
-and the chair's
locked to the ground.
-What?!

22:58.812 --> 23:00.379
No, no!

23:00.422 --> 23:02.555
Yo, man, he didn't need
to hear that.

23:02.598 --> 23:04.687
Well, he was gonna find out
in around 72 seconds.

23:04.731 --> 23:07.168
JT:
We need to get one arm free.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.605
Find a screwdriver.
I can pick the lock.

23:09.649 --> 23:10.737
BRIGHT:
There's not enough time.

23:13.522 --> 23:16.003
JT, kitchen.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.527
Get ice. Lots.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.790
-NICO: What's happening?
-I'm gonna chop off your hand.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.489
-What?
-[chuckles]

23:25.882 --> 23:27.406
Ah!

23:27.449 --> 23:29.930
-There's really no other option.
-[whimpers]

23:29.973 --> 23:32.149

come a long way,

23:32.193 --> 23:34.282
so... deep breaths.

23:34.325 --> 23:35.588
-No, no, no.
-Deep breaths!

23:35.631 --> 23:37.677
How much time we got
on the clock, Bright?

-[timer beeping]
-I'm willing to let go

23:44.031 --> 23:45.467
-and trust myself.
-Hey, Bright.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.469
-Wait, man! Don't do...
-[screams]

23:47.513 --> 23:48.775
-Gil.
-Talk to me.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.646
Thank God. I-I-I lost him.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.431

He wants to inflict as much pain

That's why he's using
The Surgeon's Quartet.

It was an experiment to find

24:51.359 --> 24:52.882

25:04.415 --> 25:05.852
Well, I don't,

25:05.895 --> 25:08.028
uh, but his psychology
implies dysmorphia.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.291
He hates his own body.

25:10.334 --> 25:14.687
Yet we saw an imposing man
at Nico's, so I'm thinking bald.
