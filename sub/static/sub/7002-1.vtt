00:04.236 --> 00:07.038
Thank you very much
and welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

00:07.039 --> 00:09.040
I'm your host, of course,
tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:09.041 --> 00:12.210
And you all know my assistant,
al "I can't find a better job"
borland.

00:14.279 --> 00:16.280
Anyway, all this week,

00:16.280 --> 00:18.683
Al and I'll be doing
our salute...

00:18.684 --> 00:20.685
<i>(ping/groan)</i>
...To safety.

00:20.686 --> 00:22.887
Because, after all, al,
a safe workplace

00:22.888 --> 00:24.489
Is a happy workplace, right?

00:24.490 --> 00:27.191
I wouldn't know, tim.

00:29.394 --> 00:31.896
And who better to help us
with our salute...

00:31.897 --> 00:33.965
<i>(ping/groan)</i>
...To safety week

00:33.966 --> 00:36.034
Than the boys at k & b
construction company.

00:36.035 --> 00:38.436
Let's get them out here
with a big round of applause
from the <i>tool time</i> crowd.

00:38.437 --> 00:41.039
Come on, get them out here!

00:48.480 --> 00:49.814
Welcome aboard, guys.

00:49.815 --> 00:51.549
Hey, always great
to be here, timmy.

00:51.550 --> 00:54.185
The reason I asked these guys
down here is a darn good one.

00:54.186 --> 00:56.354
These guys probably have the
toughest job in construction

00:56.355 --> 00:58.990
In the state of michigan -
working on the high steel.

00:58.991 --> 01:02.861
And these guys have
a perfect safety record
for the last 195 days.

01:02.862 --> 01:05.997
195! Think about that--

01:05.998 --> 01:09.034
Uh, timmy, I'm afraid
that record stopped at 194.

01:09.035 --> 01:11.269
Good night, nurse.
What happened?

01:11.270 --> 01:16.274
Well, yesterday, somebody had
a little accident with a rivet.

01:16.275 --> 01:18.276
Well, you see, tim,
I was so excited

01:18.277 --> 01:20.511
About coming back
on your show,

01:20.512 --> 01:23.882
I let one of
those red-hot rivets slip.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.817
Yes, you did.

01:28.054 --> 01:30.488
Hey, look on the bright side.

01:30.489 --> 01:33.424
You didn't burn any hair.

01:33.425 --> 01:36.961
Tim, rivet accidents
are no laughing matter.

01:36.962 --> 01:39.597
And neither are you, al.

01:39.598 --> 01:42.067
Hey, before we get to
our safety demonstration,

01:42.068 --> 01:45.670
I'd like to get to a letter
on a very controversial subject

01:45.671 --> 01:49.440
By a charles eddington
from grosse point, michigan.

01:49.441 --> 01:51.442
He writes, "dear tim,

01:51.443 --> 01:54.779
"you've taken this
masculinism bit too far.

01:54.780 --> 01:57.348
"all you do is use loud tools,

01:57.349 --> 01:59.483
"act macho
and grunt like an ape.

01:59.484 --> 02:02.087
Your show makes me sick
and so do you."

02:02.088 --> 02:04.089
<i>(chortles)</i>

02:10.196 --> 02:12.396
He continues,

02:12.397 --> 02:16.201
"I'd like to see a lot less
of that al guy. I hate al."

02:18.237 --> 02:19.503
Can I see that, tim?

02:19.504 --> 02:21.973
We don't have time
for that, al.

02:21.974 --> 02:25.810
You know, maybe chas is right.

02:25.811 --> 02:27.645
Maybe we should stop
this grunting.
What do you think?

02:27.646 --> 02:29.948
<i>(all)</i> no!
Hey.

02:29.949 --> 02:31.616
Folks, what do you think?
Stop the grunting?

02:31.617 --> 02:32.984
No!

02:32.985 --> 02:35.386
Well, chuckie, I tried.

02:35.387 --> 02:37.388
I think it's time
to give this letter back

02:37.389 --> 02:39.390
To the complaint department.

02:40.993 --> 02:42.293
Lisa!

02:42.294 --> 02:45.663
Whoa.
Whoa.

02:45.664 --> 02:47.598
Here you go, tim.
All loaded.

02:47.599 --> 02:50.769
Thanks, lisa.
Chuckie, this...

02:52.805 --> 02:56.474
Is the complaint department.

02:56.475 --> 02:57.909
Al?

02:59.511 --> 03:02.346
You wanna hold
that letter up for me?

03:04.817 --> 03:07.218
I don't think so, tim.

03:07.219 --> 03:09.788
I'd like to respond by saying,

03:09.789 --> 03:12.590
"charlie, thanks for
sharing your feelings.

03:14.827 --> 03:18.263
Please feel free
to write anytime."

03:18.264 --> 03:20.198
<i>(men)</i> yeah!

04:28.300 --> 04:30.034
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

04:36.641 --> 04:39.344
Mom, why are you dropping
flowers on the table?

04:39.345 --> 04:42.146
They're petals, see?
It's romantic.

04:42.147 --> 04:44.382
I'm gonna give your father
this surprise dinner tonight,

04:44.383 --> 04:47.551
And I want everything
to be perfect for him.

04:47.552 --> 04:50.054
Then why aren't you eating
in front of the tv?

04:52.557 --> 04:54.292
Why don't you go
get your suitcase?

04:54.293 --> 04:56.427
Randy, come on, move it.
Not yet.

04:56.428 --> 04:58.596
I think brad and jennifer
are gonna kiss.

04:58.597 --> 05:00.365
What?

05:00.366 --> 05:05.336
Well, they've been looking
at each other like that
for an hour.

05:05.337 --> 05:07.972
I have never seen him stare
at anything that long.

05:07.973 --> 05:10.875
Maybe I should just glue
his history book to her face.

05:10.876 --> 05:12.710
Ah, they're coming.

05:14.146 --> 05:16.547
Bye, mrs. Taylor.
Oh, jennifer.

05:16.548 --> 05:19.117
I didn't know you were
still here. Well, bye.

05:19.118 --> 05:20.484
Will I see you tomorrow?

05:20.485 --> 05:22.120
Yeah, I'll be playing football
at the park.

05:22.121 --> 05:23.754
Maybe I'll come by.
That'd be great.

05:23.755 --> 05:25.790
Ok. Bye.
Bye.

05:25.791 --> 05:28.893
Well, jennifer punched you.

05:28.894 --> 05:31.396
Cathy kramer said
when a girl punches a boy,

05:31.397 --> 05:35.934
She wants to get a hot kiss
on the lips.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.836
That is not what it means.

05:38.837 --> 05:41.172
Well, cathy kramer
should know, mom.

05:41.173 --> 05:43.541
She went to school
in France.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.676
You stay away from her.

05:47.246 --> 05:51.115
And, brad, you are
way too young to be
thinking about kissing.

05:51.116 --> 05:53.384
There's other things that you
need to think about first.

05:53.385 --> 05:55.320
Like, um... Shaving.

05:55.321 --> 05:57.822
I've shaved.

05:57.823 --> 06:01.259
Not a cat, stupid.

06:04.696 --> 06:06.931
Uh, we'll go pack.

06:09.634 --> 06:12.236
<i>(overlapping shouts)</i>

06:15.807 --> 06:18.343
<i>(al)</i> you're representing
<i>tool time</i> here.

06:18.344 --> 06:20.511
You do better
when you don't concentrate.

06:20.512 --> 06:21.946
Just don't concentrate.

06:21.947 --> 06:24.382
That's it.
Time!

06:26.452 --> 06:30.221
All right, let's see.
Rock, you've got...

06:30.222 --> 06:32.223
14 peanuts in your hat.

06:32.224 --> 06:34.459
Yes!
Tim...

06:34.460 --> 06:36.060
...You've got 15.
<i>(tim)</i> yes!

06:36.061 --> 06:37.795
No! Count 'em again!
Yeah!

Winner and still champion,
tim "the tool man" taylor.

06:40.832 --> 06:45.003
And the crowd goes wild.
Yeah! Yeah!

06:45.004 --> 06:47.405
It's getting late, guys.
I'm gonna call my wife
real quick.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.540
No, wait, tim.
Am I hearing this right?

06:49.541 --> 06:51.976
You have to check in
with the little woman?

06:51.977 --> 06:54.678
Those pants come
in a man's size, timmy?

06:54.679 --> 06:56.481
Hey, back off, fellas.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.850
I'm showing
a little consideration.
You got a problem with this?

Tim, where are you?

07:16.635 --> 07:18.503
I'm down at big mike's
with the guys from k & b.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.506
Well, I thought you said
this morning that you were
coming right home.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.341
<i>Yeah, I know I said that,</i>
<i>but we had a great show,</i>

07:23.342 --> 07:26.044
<i>So we stopped by</i>
<i>for a few beers.</i>
<i>Is that all right?</i>

07:26.045 --> 07:29.414
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That sounds like fun.

Uh, but, I want you to know...

07:31.583 --> 07:34.152
<i>(suggestively)</i> ...That
I'm really looking forward
to seeing you.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.619
Oh, same here, you know.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.455
I'll be home real soon -
15 minutes, tops.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.457
I'm on my way
out the door right now.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.858
Set your timer.

07:40.859 --> 07:45.763
Ok. I'm just gonna be
listening to a little, um...

<i>Ok. Bye-bye.</i>

07:52.637 --> 07:54.105
Bye-bye.

Hey, guys, I think
I gotta get outta here.

07:57.142 --> 07:59.009
<i>(men)</i> no!
You just got here.

07:59.010 --> 08:01.446
Timmy, you can't leave.
Your peanut crown's on the line.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.247
You've been challenged
in the peanut plunge.

08:03.248 --> 08:04.815
By who? I beat everybody.

08:04.816 --> 08:06.817
Except me.

08:06.818 --> 08:08.652
Ooh.

08:11.156 --> 08:12.290
One more.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.325
<i>(overlapping shouts)</i>
set it up!

08:17.229 --> 08:19.097
<i>(low voice on tv)</i>

08:19.098 --> 08:22.100
Two hours. Unbelievable.

"set the timer."

08:27.506 --> 08:29.107
Hello.

08:31.810 --> 08:33.744
It's me.

08:35.313 --> 08:39.350
Hey, jill, what are you doing
sitting here in the--

08:39.351 --> 08:41.119
Uh-oh.

08:45.224 --> 08:48.892
Hey, looks like you planned
something special.
Yeah.

08:48.893 --> 08:51.329
You put together
a little dinner for--
uh-huh.

08:51.330 --> 08:54.232
<i>(clears throat)</i>
hey, where are the kids?

08:54.233 --> 08:57.168
Your mother came
and picked them up.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.937
No kids. Oh, no.

09:01.806 --> 09:05.643
Yeah, so we could have a nice,
romantic evening alone together,

09:05.644 --> 09:10.114
Just me and that chicken
on your plate.

09:10.115 --> 09:13.351
So you must've had
to carry the conversation.

09:17.556 --> 09:19.390
I just wanna know
what happened to

09:19.391 --> 09:21.692
"15 minutes, set the timer."

09:21.693 --> 09:23.661
Hey, I'm really sorry,
but the guys and I

09:23.662 --> 09:28.966
Got into some real serious
discussions about, um...

09:28.967 --> 09:31.135
Relationship things, you know -

09:31.136 --> 09:34.572
Men/women stuff,
sharing feelings.

09:34.573 --> 09:37.107
Pretty heavy stuff.

09:39.444 --> 09:43.381
I spent two days
planning this evening.

09:43.382 --> 09:45.516
Do you have any idea
how long it's been

09:45.517 --> 09:49.019
Since we had a quiet,
romantic evening together?

09:49.020 --> 09:50.921
I was on the phone.
Why didn't you say,
"come home"?

09:50.922 --> 09:52.490
I wanted to surprise you.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.225
Well, I'm surprised.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.195
Come on, jill. Lighten up.

09:57.196 --> 09:58.862
I didn't understand
what you meant on the phone.

09:58.863 --> 10:01.365
Well, what did you think
I meant when I said
all that stuff about

10:01.366 --> 10:03.934
How I was looking forward
to seeing you and, um...

10:03.935 --> 10:05.703
<i>(deep singsong voice)</i>
..."I'll be waiting"?

10:05.704 --> 10:09.373
Oh, like you said it like that,
"I'll be waiting."

10:09.374 --> 10:11.342
Well, I wanted
to be more subtle!

10:11.343 --> 10:13.611
What did you want me to say?
"the kids are gone.

10:13.612 --> 10:17.147
I'm home alone.
Come and take me, big daddy"?

10:19.251 --> 10:21.552
Well, that I understand.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.525
Good night.
Oh, come on, jill.

10:27.526 --> 10:30.294
I don't go out
with these guys every night.
What's making you so angry?

10:30.295 --> 10:32.530
I am angry because you said
you were gonna be home
in 15 minutes

10:32.531 --> 10:33.964
And then you weren't!

10:33.965 --> 10:35.966
Because I'm flirting with you
like crazy on the phone

10:35.967 --> 10:37.368
And you didn't even notice!

10:37.369 --> 10:40.638
And most of all, because I went
to all this trouble for nothing!

10:40.639 --> 10:42.640
I spent the whole evening
by myself.

10:42.641 --> 10:45.175
And now you're stuck
with a plate of cold food.

10:45.176 --> 10:47.678
Oh, don't worry about me.
I ate at the bar.

10:50.215 --> 10:54.452
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I didn't have dessert!

10:57.289 --> 11:00.190
When a girl punches you,

11:00.191 --> 11:03.894
Do you think she wants
to kiss you?

11:03.895 --> 11:06.964
If it's an uppercut, no.

11:06.965 --> 11:10.601
If it's a short jab
to the shoulder... Mm, maybe.

11:10.602 --> 11:14.204
That's what I thought.

11:14.205 --> 11:17.275
<i>(clears throat)</i>

11:17.276 --> 11:21.445
Has jennifer been giving you
jabs or uppercuts?

11:21.446 --> 11:23.414
Jabs.
Uh-huh.

11:23.415 --> 11:25.449
Does that worry you?
Yeah.

11:25.450 --> 11:27.451
Me too.

11:29.288 --> 11:32.156
But when you and mom kiss,
do you ever bump noses?

11:32.157 --> 11:35.626
Are you kidding?
We got the tilt thing down.

11:35.627 --> 11:37.828
When you kiss a woman,
you gotta lean to one side,

11:37.829 --> 11:41.165
She's gotta go to the other side
so you don't mash noses.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.367
Unless you could find a woman
whose nose is big enough

11:43.368 --> 11:45.303
You could fit right into it.

11:47.639 --> 11:49.072
Listen...
Dad...

11:50.509 --> 11:53.311
Don't rush into
this kissing thing, ok?

11:53.312 --> 11:55.780
That's what mom said.
She said I'm too young.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.247
And she's right.
She's really smart.

11:57.248 --> 12:00.451
We didn't start kissing
until last week.

12:00.452 --> 12:02.453
Hey, doof, want to go
play some football?

12:02.454 --> 12:03.554
Don't punch me!

12:03.555 --> 12:05.155
He punched you, gotta kiss him.

12:05.156 --> 12:08.058
Come on.
<i>(brad)</i> no way.

12:08.059 --> 12:10.093
Hey, hey, hey, leave
those eggs alone, please.

12:10.094 --> 12:12.363
It's my breakfast.
Well, where's mom?

12:12.364 --> 12:15.032
And how come
you're eating alone?
No reason.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.967
You and mom have a fight?

12:16.968 --> 12:19.303
No, we did have a fight.

12:19.304 --> 12:22.005
So, what'd you do wrong, dad?

12:22.006 --> 12:23.941
I didn't do anything wrong.
Remember that, little mister.

12:23.942 --> 12:25.509
Now, go on and play
or do something.

12:25.510 --> 12:27.211
Ok, ok.

12:27.212 --> 12:31.148
Just because he has
a fight with mom,
he has to take it out on me.

12:34.085 --> 12:36.320
Tim, about last night, I...

12:38.490 --> 12:40.758
Did you make me breakfast?

12:46.798 --> 12:48.733
Yeah, yeah.

12:53.338 --> 12:57.842
This is really sweet.
Well, you're worth it,
honey.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.477
I was just...
I got up this morning,

12:59.478 --> 13:03.981
And I was thinking,
"what could I do for jill?"

13:06.551 --> 13:09.487
And it just came
to me - eggs.

13:09.488 --> 13:12.356
Thank you.
They're delicious.
Mm.

13:12.357 --> 13:14.592
Tim, I feel really bad
about last night.
I think I really--

13:14.593 --> 13:15.926
Hey, dad.
Don't interrupt.

13:15.927 --> 13:19.196
How come mom gets
to eat your eggs?

13:19.197 --> 13:21.198
There's no name on these.

13:21.199 --> 13:23.434
<i>(chuckles)</i> kids.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.636
Great.

13:25.637 --> 13:27.705
Your eggs?
What's mine is yours, honey.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.273
I know, tim.
What's yours is yours.

13:29.274 --> 13:30.908
You see, that's the difference
between us.

13:30.909 --> 13:32.376
I would've made you breakfast,

13:32.377 --> 13:34.311
Because I'm always
focused on you.

13:34.312 --> 13:36.714
Are you saying I don't do
anything romantic for you?

13:36.715 --> 13:38.716
No, that's not what I'm saying.

13:38.717 --> 13:42.185
In fact, that whole thing
last night was your idea.

13:42.186 --> 13:43.788
That was my idea?
Yeah.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.790
You know the other night
when we were watching

13:45.791 --> 13:47.792
That charles boyer movie
on the late show,

13:47.793 --> 13:50.528
And there was that real romantic
candlelight-dinner scene

13:50.529 --> 13:52.463
Between ingrid bergman
and charles boyer?

13:52.464 --> 13:56.266
You said, "wouldn't it
be nice if we did that?"

13:56.267 --> 13:58.936
I meant talk with accents.

14:06.110 --> 14:09.079
Why don't you just
ever tune in to me?

14:09.080 --> 14:11.014
What am I supposed to do?
Read your mind?

14:11.015 --> 14:14.051
At least when I want something,
it's pretty clear
what it is I want.

14:14.052 --> 14:16.987
Well, that's true, tim.
Your signals are real clear.

14:16.988 --> 14:18.989
You crush a beer can
on your head,

14:18.990 --> 14:22.693
That means, um,
"I need another one."

14:22.694 --> 14:26.096
You belch... <i>(belches)</i>

14:26.097 --> 14:28.031
...That's, "I'm done."

14:29.668 --> 14:32.235
And, um,
"honey, I took a shower,"

14:32.236 --> 14:34.472
That's, "wake up, I'm ready."

14:36.908 --> 14:40.377
Safety on the job site
is a priority.

14:40.378 --> 14:43.080
That's why proper equipment
is essential:

14:43.081 --> 14:45.015
Custom-designed hard hat...

14:48.653 --> 14:50.888
...And proper safety goggles
to protect your eyes

14:50.889 --> 14:53.223
From unexpected objects.

14:58.029 --> 15:00.397
Anyway, these goggles
are especially coated

15:00.398 --> 15:03.634
To reduce glare
and prevent scratching.

15:06.337 --> 15:09.272
And they're vented
for your added comfort.

15:09.273 --> 15:11.475
And so is al.

15:14.980 --> 15:18.616
Anyway, the important thing here
is safety on the job site.

15:18.617 --> 15:22.152
And safety starts
at a little spot
right here.

15:22.153 --> 15:24.788
You must have direct
and clear communication

15:24.789 --> 15:26.490
Between your coworkers.

15:26.491 --> 15:29.393
Al, look out!

15:29.394 --> 15:31.194
See? See?

15:31.195 --> 15:33.864
Had this been a real emergency,
al would be safe,

15:33.865 --> 15:37.668
Because I gave him
a clear and direct signal.

15:37.669 --> 15:40.137
And as al's coworker,
I'm concerned with his safety,

15:40.138 --> 15:42.873
Just as al is concerned
with mine. Right, al?

15:42.874 --> 15:45.108
What's your point, tim?

15:45.109 --> 15:47.945
Good, direct question.

15:47.946 --> 15:49.513
My point is,

15:49.514 --> 15:52.049
I don't think women are as clear
with their signals as men.

15:52.050 --> 15:54.484
I know they're not.
On a job site, for instance,

15:54.485 --> 15:58.422
If a man holds up a stop sign,
he means, "hey, stop there!"

15:58.423 --> 16:02.292
If woman holds up a stop sign,
if she designed this, it'd say,

16:02.293 --> 16:06.229
"if you really knew me,
you'd know what
you should do right now."

16:10.802 --> 16:13.270
<i>(randy)</i> come on, come on.
Hurry up. They're coming.

16:14.940 --> 16:19.142
Boy, billy really hit you hard
on that touchdown.

16:19.143 --> 16:22.379
Yeah. It's no big deal.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.582
Is your arm ok?

16:24.583 --> 16:28.385
Just tore off a hunk of skin.
It doesn't hurt.

16:28.386 --> 16:30.721
I fell off my bike once
and cut my knee.

16:30.722 --> 16:33.323
It was all green
and full of pus.

16:33.324 --> 16:36.393
Ooh, cool.

16:36.394 --> 16:38.829
You want to see the scar?
Sure.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.471
Jill? Hey, jill.

16:50.241 --> 16:52.977
I... Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt anything.

16:52.978 --> 16:55.412
Excuse me a minute, jennifer.
Brad, where's your mom?

16:55.413 --> 16:58.582
I don't know.
<i>(mark)</i> she went to the store!

17:03.221 --> 17:05.454

Come out of here.

17:05.455 --> 17:08.290
You guys are dead.
Get down out of that tree.

17:08.291 --> 17:10.027
Come on, jennifer.
I'll walk you home.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.729
Ok. Bye, mr. Taylor.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.463
Bye, jennifer.

17:13.464 --> 17:16.233
What the heck do you think
you're doing up there?

17:16.233 --> 17:18.568
I hope you're satisfied.
You embarrassed your brother
on his date.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.537
Yeah, that was the plan.

17:21.973 --> 17:23.973
Bad plan.

Mm.

I say the signals are so subtle,
no man could pick them up.

18:24.368 --> 18:28.038
Well, tim, I think men
are capable of grasping
very subtle ideas.

18:28.039 --> 18:30.007

18:30.008 --> 18:32.676
Well, maybe not all men.

Now, if something went wrong
with that engine,
you'd be able to hear it?

Oh, yeah.

You here by yourself?

19:57.796 --> 20:00.563

you should do that.

It's not tim - it's fred.
Here's your problem.

20:16.580 --> 20:19.516
The receiver's just not
picking up signals.

20:19.517 --> 20:21.618

speak clearly enough.

21:05.696 --> 21:09.532
Well, there she is.
Good as new.

21:09.533 --> 21:13.904
Does this mean that
my husband will pick up
on all my signals now?

21:13.905 --> 21:15.705
Loud and clear, babe.

21:15.706 --> 21:19.642
