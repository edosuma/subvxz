00:02.127 --> 00:03.586
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:03.671 --> 00:06.005
The only thing that's gonna save you
right now is the truth.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.715
The truth about your mama's money.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.550
Have you heard of Ellstin Limehouse?

00:09.635 --> 00:11.135
I'm the only one he will give it to.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.346
That money dies right here with me.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.849
Boyd instructed that you burn the weed.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.017
We ain't burning it.

00:18.102 --> 00:19.310
Those were Boyd's orders.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.145
Wade Messer.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.022
Keep your hands where I can see them.

00:23.107 --> 00:24.607
So, how you been keeping yourself?

00:24.692 --> 00:27.110
Pretty good, joined the Marshals Service.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.238
Marshals Service, huh?
Boy, I'd have never guessed that.

00:34.118 --> 00:36.119
Right there. Nobody gonna tell me
that wasn't no base hit.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.121
To what do I owe the pleasure?

00:38.205 --> 00:40.331
Deputy Gutterson has some questions
for you.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.291
As I recall, last time we met,

00:42.376 --> 00:46.003
you told me next conversation we had
wasn't gonna be a conversation.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.005
This is a different conversation.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.341
You had a good thing going here, Emmitt.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.635
But you let go of the rope.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.055
You know me now?

00:57.015 --> 00:58.141
Yeah.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.478
Sometime it come out better than others,
but when it do,

01:02.563 --> 01:07.775
boy, it is a sweet, spicy, smoky,
juicy, tender piece of heaven,

01:07.860 --> 01:09.527
if I do say so myself.

01:10.446 --> 01:13.614
And despite all that,
I know it ain't good enough

01:13.699 --> 01:19.120
for you to come all the way out here,
alone, this time of night, to have some.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.582
I'm afraid you figured me out.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.208
I ain't here for the barbecue.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.045
Yeah, well, whatever reason,
it's nice to see you, Ava.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.673
And you, Mr. Limehouse.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.341
Well, you looking well.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.011
Better than the last time
we saw each other, anyway.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.514
You can bet that. Though you do seem
to be favoring that shoulder,

01:38.807 --> 01:40.266
if I'm not mistaken.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.559
You're not.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.520
But it ain't because of anything Bowman did
if that's what you're thinking.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.148
No. No. I heard what happened
to your husband.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.526
Yeah, the paper said you done it
at the dinner table.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.697
Shame of it was wasting all that ham.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.201
I was thinking the shame of it was I wouldn't
be seeing you around here anymore.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.660
Well, that's sweet.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.079
That, young lady, is the truth.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.582
So, you got yourself a new boyfriend yet?

02:05.083 --> 02:07.585
Funny. That's actually why I'm here.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.715
I think you should meet.

02:27.231 --> 02:30.107
That black bastard even twitches,
we gonna mow them all down.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.745
Ellstin Limehouse. Boyd Crowder.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.373
You boys play nice.

02:49.044 --> 02:53.673
You know, my father and then, you know,

02:53.757 --> 02:56.634
like his father before him and so on,

02:57.553 --> 03:02.723
they always kept armed guard
on this bridge at all times.

03:03.225 --> 03:06.102
Back then, it was a necessary precaution.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.145
I mean, not so much anymore,

03:08.939 --> 03:12.358
though there are still those
who wish my people harm

03:13.277 --> 03:20.241
and those who advocate for the restoration
of white supremacy in the land.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.617
You believe that?

03:21.702 --> 03:24.787
I didn't come all the way out here
to discuss ideology.

03:26.164 --> 03:29.625
I think maybe you best tell me
what you did come here to discuss.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.837
Well, it has come to my attention
that you are in possession of something

03:32.921 --> 03:36.424
that belonged to Mags Bennett.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.136
Now, if that were true,

03:41.555 --> 03:44.557
what you know of me, you think
I'd be telling you other people's business?

03:44.641 --> 03:49.353
Not the living. No.
But poor Mags is now on the other side.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.233
Yeah, well, some agreements
transcend the grave, Mr. Crowder.

03:54.318 --> 03:57.194
Well, that's an agreement
that you made with Mags,

03:57.863 --> 04:00.364
but you continue to honor it
because of her son Dickie.

04:00.449 --> 04:04.327
Now, it seems to me that if Dickie
were to join Mags in the afterlife

04:05.329 --> 04:08.414
that there would be no person
for that money to go to,

04:09.499 --> 04:11.208
except maybe you and me.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.505
I'm disappointed to hear you say that,
Mr. Crowder.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.346
I was hoping that maybe you'd come here
to discuss other business.

04:24.640 --> 04:28.184
Could you give my regards to Arlo Givens?

04:28.852 --> 04:32.939
I believe last time I saw him
was on this very bridge.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.233
Night.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.277
To satiate my curiosity,

04:38.362 --> 04:40.947
would you mind telling me
what other business

04:41.031 --> 04:42.949
you think we might have to discuss?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.620
You know, I was figuring
maybe you need a little help

04:48.872 --> 04:51.123
with your weed problem.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.558
Arlo, just 'cause you're an old man,

05:10.060 --> 05:11.852
the only reason
you're not getting one of these.

05:13.939 --> 05:18.067
Next time Ava gives you an order,
like "burn the weed," you follow it.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.528
Let's go.

05:56.773 --> 05:57.773
It's got two sinks.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.776
- I heard about that.
- Double-bowl vanity.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.486
- That's what they called it.
- That's fancy.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.780
Figure that, separate commode area,

06:05.907 --> 06:08.784
could add three, four years
onto our relationship.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.703
- Givens.
<i>- Hey, Raylan. It's Tom Bergen.</i>

06:10.787 --> 06:12.288
You just said "commode," didn't you?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.165
I thought it sounded better than "crapper."

06:14.249 --> 06:15.916
<i>- You doing anything right now?</i>
- No. Nothing.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.210
<i>Wade Messer's been spotted.
We're setting up a road block.</i>

06:18.295 --> 06:19.670
<i>I can give you the location.</i>

06:20.672 --> 06:24.300
Yeah. Just text it to me.
I can be there in an hour.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.221
You're not gonna see the house, are you?

06:29.306 --> 06:30.890
Not immediately.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.391
Okay.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.518
- I'm sorry. I just have to...
- You don't have to apologize.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.812
It's your job. Go do your job.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.024
You like these guys
for how many armed robberies?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.734
We're looking at them for, like, 12.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.194
Doesn't sound like Wade Messer.

06:43.445 --> 06:46.405
Guy that strung you up in a tree
and tried to hit you with a bat?

06:46.490 --> 06:48.783
He strung me up in a tree.
He didn't hit me with the bat.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.078
You heard about that football player
killed all them dogs?

06:52.162 --> 06:54.538
Got a few years in the pen for it.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.582
I heard about it a little, I guess.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.627
See, to me, that ain't right.
I mean, they just dogs.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.588
I know dudes killed people,
got less than two years for it.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.007
- Who?
- What?

07:05.509 --> 07:08.928
Who do you know that killed people,
got less than two years for it?

07:15.811 --> 07:17.228
That don't look like no accident.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.191
Hey, Raylan!

07:22.442 --> 07:23.651
Say what?

07:23.735 --> 07:27.696
That guy down there with the hat,
his name's Raylan Givens. He's a Marshal.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.658
J.T., it might be a good time
to get out of here.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.369
Jesus! God damn it!

07:50.387 --> 07:51.428
Come on.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.060
Show me your hands! Show me your hands!

07:58.812 --> 07:59.937
Where's Messer?

08:04.860 --> 08:07.361
I don't punch like a girl.
You punch like a girl.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.781
I punch like a... That's because you
can't handle being punched like a man.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.950
Dickie! You caught me in the nose!

08:13.034 --> 08:15.953
I'm so sorry. I think it hurt...
Look, you caught me.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.373
You two are an awfully cute couple.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.001
Shit, man. It ain't like that.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.878
Why don't you get some exercise, Crowe?

08:24.254 --> 08:25.337
I'm good.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.340
- Did it look like I was asking, numbnuts?
- No. He's good.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.096
Thank you.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.393
You know, incidents
like the one with Crowder,

08:40.312 --> 08:42.938
they happen in this place all the time.

08:43.273 --> 08:47.276
If it wasn't for us kindhearted guards
looking out for you,

08:48.278 --> 08:50.988
life in this facility would be more miserable
and violent than it already is.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.825
Officer, I believe you're trying to scare me.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.244
I mean, you're doing your best.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.330
You're doing your best, but what...

08:59.414 --> 09:03.292
What I don't understand is,
why would that be?

09:05.587 --> 09:09.006
I overheard every word of that conversation
between you and Crowder,

09:09.841 --> 09:11.133
and I want that money.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.178
Okay.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.690
I ain't got no money, bro!
You think I got money?

09:26.775 --> 09:30.486
Let me tell you something.
What you were listening to in there, okay,

09:30.570 --> 09:32.655
that is what you call a ruse.

09:33.406 --> 09:38.535
I was doing whatever I needed to do to keep
that psychopath from cutting me open, man.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.412
I ain't got no money, man.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.628
That's actually kind of funny.
'Cause at first, I thought the same thing.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.465
I thought, "Oh, this is a..." A "ruse"?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.217
- Ruse. Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.219
So I made a phone call,

09:55.303 --> 09:59.223
and I called a buddy of mine who is in
the local down in your neck of the woods.

09:59.557 --> 10:05.104
He told me that your dead mama
was one big shot-caller.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.858
So you get me that money,

10:09.943 --> 10:13.362
or life in here will take a turn
for the disastrous.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.114
Let me tell you something.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.826
If you truly had been paying attention
to my encounter with Boyd Crowder,

10:18.910 --> 10:24.206
then you would know that even
if there were money, which there ain't,

10:25.250 --> 10:31.255
how am I gonna get my hands on that money,
you think, while I am inside here?

10:31.589 --> 10:36.468
You follow me? So you and Boyd
and everybody else who wants a piece of me,

10:36.553 --> 10:40.806
you're just gonna have to hold your horses,

10:40.890 --> 10:44.560
that's right, until I am home,
sweet out of here.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.353
Is that all?

10:50.817 --> 10:54.987
This here's a 24-piece combination set,
hardly ever been used!

10:55.071 --> 10:58.657
I am aware of that. My offer is still $3.

10:58.742 --> 11:02.661
3 bucks? Come on, man!
I ain't giving this shit away!

11:03.580 --> 11:05.080
I'm sorry.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.749
Did I come into your place of business

11:06.833 --> 11:09.835
and ask you
to take a crappy wrench set off my hands?

11:13.089 --> 11:16.008
- Okay. We're done.
- Huh?

11:17.218 --> 11:19.303
I don't want your wrench set. Get out.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.433
Asshole.

11:24.726 --> 11:28.562
- Kiss your mama with that mouth?
- I sure do, if she were still alive.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.942
What happened?

11:34.319 --> 11:36.445
They had a roadblock.
They was waiting for us.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.030
Jesus Christ!

11:38.198 --> 11:39.448
You idiot.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.076
Beckett, shut up.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.453
Where's J.T.?

11:47.415 --> 11:50.125
So, you come all the way out here
to let Messer get away?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.878
One of your boys let him get away.
I got the driver.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.089
Besides, these boots
aren't made for running.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.966
And yet chasing fugitives
is a Marshal's primary function.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.426
It's ironic, isn't it?

11:59.511 --> 12:00.761
Hey! Dull roar.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.722
- "Bring your kids to work" day?
- "Wife's sicker than shit" day.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.808
That explains the fried chicken for breakfast.

12:05.934 --> 12:06.934
All this crap's stolen.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.018
Truck itself's a dead end,

12:08.103 --> 12:10.020
but those plates turn up
on toll-booth cameras

12:10.105 --> 12:11.897
every few weeks between here and Frankfort.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.566
- Dixie Mafia.
- On the receiving end, probably.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.404
Word is somebody's giving addicts
laundry lists of swag to steal.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.322
Pays them in Oxy.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.741
What are you thinking?

12:22.826 --> 12:25.369
Well, I always knew Messer
was a bit of a drunk.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.829
Now he's looking like an addict to me.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.039
You know what they say the difference is?

12:29.124 --> 12:31.959
A drunk will steal your wallet
and feel like shit about it.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.919
Addict will steal your wallet
and help you look for it.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.421
Help you look for it.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.799
These days in this county, a lot of folks
will help you look for your wallet.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.343
- I guess Messer's one of them.
- Yeah.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.679
Hey, you want us to hold on to that J.T. fella,

12:43.763 --> 12:46.014
you know, the one you did manage to get,
so you can question him?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.600
- Why's that?
- Just posted bail about five minutes ago.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.312
- I'd like to know who posted his bail.
- All right.

12:55.233 --> 12:58.193
You sorry sack of monkey shit.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.447
Least he was able to get away.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.614
It was his fault I got caught.

13:02.699 --> 13:03.907
I don't want to hear it.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.868
You say anything to the cops?
Anything at all?

13:05.952 --> 13:07.453
No. I didn't see him say nothing.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.037
I ask you?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.708
- Well?
- Not a word.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.296
Here. You aren't wearing a wire
or anything, are you?

13:17.380 --> 13:19.923
No. He's not wearing a wire, boss.
I already checked him.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.759
Well, that's why I'm checking again,
'cause you did it.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.803
That's a good one, boss.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.599
I'm truly sorry, Mr. Fogle.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.851
You know what? Don't be.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.146
I mean, it's my fault, really.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.524
Work with addicts,
shit is bound to fall on your head.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.902
I'm hurting awful bad.

13:43.865 --> 13:48.577
He gets arrested, my truck gets confiscated
and he still wants his little pills.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.622
I'll go get you something real nice
right now if you want.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.917
I heard Ruth Crane
just got herself a flat-screen.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.132
You win, you get a pill.

14:05.512 --> 14:10.015
You lose, well, I'll put a pill
on your casket for you.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.936
Yeah. Make them sing for their supper.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.479
Shut up, Wally.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.400
Ain't there something else?

14:20.902 --> 14:23.111
Come on. One pull.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.638
- One more.
- Huh?

14:50.014 --> 14:52.224
You heard me. Pull it again.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.353
That ain't how Russian roulette works.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.480
You're not playing Russian roulette,
dumb shit.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.148
You're playing Harlan roulette.

15:00.608 --> 15:01.817
Come on, Mr. Fogle.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.652
What? You want to play? Huh?

15:05.029 --> 15:07.072
I'm sorry. I heard you say,
"Oh, come on, Mr. Fogle!"

15:07.156 --> 15:09.449
It sounded like what you wanted is
you wanted to have the gun

15:09.534 --> 15:11.076
'cause you can if you want.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.578
- No. No, sir.
- J.T., give it.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.081
No, second thought, you keep it, J.T.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.916
You're the one that got arrested.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.045
I already went once.
I go again, odds ain't good.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.007
Come on, now. They're not that bad.
One in five.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.635
I mean, in your condition,
with all the Oxy you do,

15:28.720 --> 15:30.429
you wouldn't live a few more years anyway.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.557
Hey! Tell you what I'll do.

15:34.976 --> 15:39.146
You pull that trigger again,
I'll give you this whole bottle.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.356
You two can share it.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.533
Go.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.263
I'm sorry.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.017
He wet himself!

16:23.900 --> 16:26.276
Boom! That's right, boy!

16:26.903 --> 16:30.280
You actually thought I was gonna
let you kill yourself in my office?

16:30.948 --> 16:32.074
Stupid.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.078
- Please, Mr. Fogle.
- "Please, Mr. Fogle."

16:46.047 --> 16:47.923
Maybe it's just your lucky day, son.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.347
Or maybe not.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.978
You two dump the body
and clean up this mess.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.653
Well, I never seen a man shot like that before.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.115
I heard about it plenty.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.407
Never seen it.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.493
You know, he bled a whole lot more
than I thought he would.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.789
How many people you seen Fogle kill?

17:23.291 --> 17:25.042
Just dig the hole, Messer.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.049
Mr. Limehouse asked we give this to you.

17:31.676 --> 17:35.929
Now, the way I see it, you boys are doing me
a favor by taking all this off my hands.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.015
Mr. Limehouse doesn't like to be
in anyone's debt.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.731
You give him my regards.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.734
You was gonna turn down
that coon's money?

17:48.818 --> 17:50.652
There can't be more than $5,000 in here.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.654
Split four ways,
you think you can retire on that?

17:52.739 --> 17:53.864
That's more than what we would have had

17:53.948 --> 17:55.115
if we'd have burned the pot like you wanted.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.367
Why do you think I wanted it, Devil?

17:58.244 --> 18:00.036
Limehouse knew we had that pot.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.122
And if he did, you can bet
plenty of other people did, too.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.957
Now, what if a cop came by?

18:04.041 --> 18:07.419
You want we should all go to jail
so that you can make $1,000.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.629
You think that sounds like smart business?

18:11.048 --> 18:12.591
This is your score.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.509
You help them load that weed.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.054
Right now.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.225
You better go, boy.

18:23.686 --> 18:24.728
Go on.

18:31.861 --> 18:35.155
Just here to make money,
same as the rest of us.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.408
You think I don't have plans
to get this crew paid, Arlo?

18:39.243 --> 18:41.953
If you do, I sure as hell haven't heard them.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.165
You haven't even told us
where the hell Johnny is.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.292
Unless I missed something.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.725
You know, my father,

19:05.061 --> 19:07.479
he considered himself a Harlan criminal,

19:08.523 --> 19:12.234
but, in fact, he became nothing more
than a middleman lining the coffers

19:12.318 --> 19:14.361
of the folks in Frankfort and Miami.

19:14.445 --> 19:17.656
Ava, could you come in here
for a minute, please, darling?

19:18.449 --> 19:20.283
And, in the end,

19:20.535 --> 19:24.037
this association cost him his life,
but we will not make that mistake.

19:25.206 --> 19:28.375
We will not work with outsiders.
We will protect Harlan.

19:28.459 --> 19:32.254
We will control every aspect of crime
within its boundaries,

19:32.922 --> 19:37.342
protection, pills, robbing and gambling.

19:37.677 --> 19:41.763
We will be meticulous and we will be clean.

19:43.099 --> 19:47.435
No more smash-and-grabs
and no more bad decisions.

19:48.271 --> 19:51.439
Now, as to the whores, well,
my father ran them and he ran them well.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.692
We will not,
not just because of Ava's objections,

19:53.776 --> 19:55.986
but because these are rock-hard times
for the working man,

19:56.070 --> 19:59.281
and he's just trying to stay level
to get his pills.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.368
Now, make no mistake about it,
everybody sitting at this table,

20:03.452 --> 20:06.580
we are all in it together
in the service of the almighty dollar.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.875
That's a fine speech,

20:10.668 --> 20:12.711
but we're gonna need more than just us.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.338
That we will, and I've already taken steps
in that direction.

20:15.423 --> 20:18.884
Now, I'd like to discuss today's business.

20:19.135 --> 20:24.139
We're going to reclaim something
that rightfully belongs to the Crowder family.

20:25.141 --> 20:29.144
You see, for years, the focus of the Oxy
business has been the Florida pill mills.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.731
That pipeline is drying up
and we are gonna fill that void.

20:33.649 --> 20:36.318
They weren't tracking users in Florida.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.154
That's what made it so easy to get pills.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.531
Kentucky, they do.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.992
That's why I came down here, Wynn.

20:45.703 --> 20:49.164
I pitched an idea to the Detroit colleagues
and they are backing me.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.919
You see, we're gonna take all this furniture
and move it out.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.713
We're gonna load it up
with computers and printers,

20:56.797 --> 21:02.218
make IDs, MRIs, X-rays, medical records,
and then we are going to Harlan.

21:02.803 --> 21:05.597
We'll set up mobile trailers,
rotate doctors in and out.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.724
If it gets hot, we move.

21:08.184 --> 21:11.102
The deal we make with the addicts is simple.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.396
We fill their prescriptions
at the regular price.

21:13.481 --> 21:14.481
They get half the pills.

21:14.565 --> 21:17.901
We ship the other half to Detroit
where we charge 10 times the price.

21:17.985 --> 21:22.322
You see, Wynn?
That is why it's called "organized crime."

21:24.033 --> 21:25.784
How soon can we get set up?

21:25.868 --> 21:27.452
Hey, buddy. What's going on?

21:28.871 --> 21:30.455
I'm at the office.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.207
No, just the usual, boring stuff.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.376
- Bathroom?
- Down the hall to the right.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.628
How's hockey?

21:37.171 --> 21:39.464
That's my boy. You crushing them?

21:43.427 --> 21:46.054
I know. Yeah.

21:50.393 --> 21:53.103
Wynn. Other door, pal.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.021
Yeah. No, I think you're gonna
love it down here.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.856
The schools are great.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.567
I know you don't like school too much
but trust me on this,

21:59.652 --> 22:01.903
you are going to love the view down here.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.504
Just starting to wonder
if anyone worked here.

22:19.588 --> 22:20.839
Just me.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.841
Hey, who drives that Vette?

22:23.467 --> 22:25.677
- That's mine.
- And you work here?

22:26.721 --> 22:28.346
I'm the owner. Glen Fogle.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.515
That explains it.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.142
Nice car.

22:32.226 --> 22:35.228
Yeah, I used to own one
of them European sports cars.

22:35.312 --> 22:36.354
On a weekly basis,

22:36.439 --> 22:41.359
somebody would be calling me a douche bag
or faggot or some derogatory shit,

22:41.444 --> 22:45.321
but now people, they just see it
and they say, "Nice car."

22:45.990 --> 22:49.409
- Is Wally working today?
- No. Like I said, just me.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.578
How much you pay him?

22:52.038 --> 22:53.371
Why? You looking for work?

22:53.456 --> 22:55.707
Well, I'm looking for someone.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.500
Fella named Wade Messer.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.671
- Never heard of him.
- Well, he and this other dude, J.T.,

23:01.797 --> 23:03.715
wanted on suspicion of armed robberies.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.342
J.T. got himself arrested this morning.

23:06.427 --> 23:11.389
Your employee Wally
posted his bail. $10,000.

23:12.183 --> 23:15.977
If that's true, I am most certainly
paying my employees too much.

23:16.187 --> 23:17.437
What you got in the back there?

23:17.521 --> 23:21.357
The back room, that's not for customers.

23:21.776 --> 23:24.319
Customer Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.572
- So, this Wade...
- Wade Messer.

23:27.656 --> 23:30.158
- ...Messer. He's a fugitive?
- He is.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.577
Well, you got a warrant there, Marshal?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.120
This is just a nice, friendly visit.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.874
Afraid without a warrant,
this is friendly as I get.

23:41.170 --> 23:46.049
Funny, 'cause I came here
'cause I'm looking for my buddy Wade,

23:47.760 --> 23:52.097
but the way you're acting makes me think

23:52.181 --> 23:55.558
maybe the person
I'm actually looking for is you.

23:57.812 --> 24:02.857
In fact, it just occurs to me
if I was running a scam,

24:03.234 --> 24:05.485
shipping stolen goods out of town,

24:05.569 --> 24:09.781
a pawn shop would be the perfect place
to hide the swag in plain sight.

24:10.241 --> 24:13.743
I'll tell you, if I ever break bad,
I will keep that in mind.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.287
See you around, Glen Fogle.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.960
Sounds like things have gotten
pretty exciting down there, Glen.

24:22.044 --> 24:25.797
I don't have any hot merchandise here.
J.T. is out of the picture.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.382
I got the other one under control,

24:27.466 --> 24:30.885
but this Marshal seems like
he's just gonna keep coming at me.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.471
- Says he's gonna get a warrant.
- Who's that?

24:33.556 --> 24:35.431
It's the pawn-shop owner down in Harlan.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.851
Raylan Givens has been sniffing around.

24:37.935 --> 24:40.311
- Cowboy Marshal. The one with that...
- With the hat.

24:40.396 --> 24:43.106
- Hey, you there?
- Yes. Mr. Fogle, I am indeed here,

24:43.190 --> 24:45.650
and when I want to talk to you,
you will hear my voice.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.569
Okay. I just didn't know.

24:47.736 --> 24:48.987
He had a hat.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.114
Have the pawn-shop guy kill him.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.577
- He's a US Marshal.
- Yeah, you tried and you failed.

24:56.287 --> 24:58.037
There were extenuating circumstances.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.998
Not a criticism, just an observation.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.584
Obviously, Givens is a hard guy to kill.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.044
Do you think Mr. Pawn-Shop Guy
is up to the task?

25:05.129 --> 25:08.047
- No.
- Exactly! What I have planned for Harlan,

25:08.257 --> 25:10.383
Mr. Pawn-Shop Guy
is more trouble than he's worth.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.468
Let Givens take care of him for us.

25:12.553 --> 25:15.430
What if he gets lucky and pops the
Marshal before the Marshal pops him?

25:16.432 --> 25:18.099
Then we get lucky.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.937
I'm sorry, Glen. Are you still there?

25:23.022 --> 25:25.106
Where else would I be? Cornholing a pig?

25:25.649 --> 25:27.275
Listen, I need you to do something.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.196
You sure?
'Cause you cannot un-ring that bell.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.658
Okay. I'll take care of it.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.541
Had a visitor while you were gone.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.669
Marshal named Givens.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.590
Says you are a federal fugitive.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.470
I was gonna tell you about that.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.222
I know.

25:57.306 --> 26:01.476
But you didn't 'cause, well,
I would have cut you off,

26:01.560 --> 26:04.729
and then you wouldn't have had
any more Oxy. That right?

26:04.813 --> 26:08.566
That's just selfish is what that is, Wade.
It's just selfish.

26:10.027 --> 26:16.574
You are a stupid, selfish,
Oxy-smoking gutter turd.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.701
I can make that up to you.

26:18.786 --> 26:22.163
Yeah, you will. I even know how.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.250
This federal that's after you, you know him?

26:25.334 --> 26:28.753
- Raylan. Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah, you old friends or something?

26:28.837 --> 26:32.090
Well, I set him up for Dickie Bennett,
strung him up in a tree.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.467
- I don't know. Is that a friend?
- Okay. Good.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.678
Now, you got a gun at your house,

26:36.762 --> 26:38.972
or did you already sell them all
to finance your habit?

26:39.348 --> 26:41.182
- No, I keep one in my bureau.
- Okay.

26:43.560 --> 26:48.106
You're gonna call this cowboy
and you're gonna say you're tired of running.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.607
That's no kind of life.

26:49.692 --> 26:52.610
And you want to meet him at your house
in an hour.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.530
Now, you go there now,
and when he comes up to the door,

26:55.614 --> 26:58.533
you say, "Hi,"
and you shoot him through the screen.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.494
Now, you think you can handle that?

27:03.122 --> 27:04.664
I mean, do I have to do that?

27:11.380 --> 27:15.717
Standing here with me
after what you seen me do,

27:17.303 --> 27:20.013
you honestly have to ask me that question?

27:20.097 --> 27:21.848
No, sir. I'm sorry.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.898
Y'all see what I mean?

27:31.608 --> 27:33.151
Yep. It is definitely worse.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.653
Smells like bleach and puke.

27:35.738 --> 27:36.738
Can I help you boys?

27:36.822 --> 27:40.366
Yeah, we gonna have to dig in deep,
get this place looking respectable again.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.453
Hey! What the hell you think you're doing?

27:43.537 --> 27:47.206
Look at this asshole,
bringing a baseball bat to a gunfight.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.542
I'm sorry. Do you know who I am?

27:50.169 --> 27:53.254
- I do not.
- Well, I'm Boyd Crowder.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.174
Now, you're probably wondering
why your day is taking this turn,

27:56.258 --> 27:57.258
and why wouldn't you?

27:57.343 --> 27:58.843
But don't worry about it. I'm gonna tell you.

27:58.927 --> 28:03.806
See, not so long ago,
this bar belonged to my cousin Johnny.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.642
- Do you remember him?
- I bought this place fair and square!

28:06.727 --> 28:08.227
Buck, have you ever been shot?

28:09.271 --> 28:11.189
I have. Right here in my chest.

28:11.273 --> 28:13.483
It hurt like hell. It almost cost me my life,

28:13.567 --> 28:17.111
but my cousin Johnny,
he took it a lot worse than I did,

28:17.237 --> 28:19.197
a shotgun at close range.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.616
He spent months laid up in a hospital room,

28:21.700 --> 28:24.494
contemplating the difficult nature
of his new existence.

28:24.578 --> 28:30.375
And while he was infirmed,
you swooped in and you took advantage.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.293
- I didn't take...
- Well, hey, now.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.088
I can't blame you
for plucking that low-hanging fruit,

28:35.172 --> 28:38.674
but the time has come
for you to right that wrong.

28:39.301 --> 28:45.139
Now, we can take this bar back
in a civilized manner,

28:45.808 --> 28:48.851
or Devil here can send you
to the hospital for months,

28:48.936 --> 28:51.979
and we can take it the same way you did.
The option is yours.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.649
So, what's it gonna be, A or B?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.152
Think I'll take option C.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.322
Now you take that gun off of him.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.537
- You met my friends?
- No. You met mine?

29:09.039 --> 29:11.582
Daddy. Good times in here today.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.209
Drop them guns right now.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.420
Well, Johnny, I believe
you got us a couple of keepers.

29:15.504 --> 29:19.590
Now, Jimmy here, we never know
what he's gonna do, so that's a problem.

29:19.842 --> 29:21.759
What's worse is Rip here.

29:21.844 --> 29:23.594
If you boys don't get
your asses out of here right now,

29:23.679 --> 29:25.596
well, we all know
what Rip's gonna do, now don't we?

29:25.681 --> 29:27.390
You can take what's left in that cash register.

29:27.474 --> 29:30.184
That's your severance pay. On the double.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.229
And we will need a deed.

29:33.605 --> 29:40.528
I want you to make it out
to B-O-Y-D C-R-O-W-D...

29:50.914 --> 29:53.666
Raylan. Well, you got here quick.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.794
Seemed like you were in a real hurry
to turn yourself in.

29:56.879 --> 29:59.172
Well, I guess you was pretty surprised
to hear from me.

29:59.506 --> 30:00.506
Little bit.

30:00.591 --> 30:04.677
Well, you know, after we crashed that truck,
running through the woods,

30:05.095 --> 30:07.763
- and I asked myself...
- Wade, no need to explain.

30:07.848 --> 30:08.890
Why's that?

30:08.974 --> 30:12.101
On account that you just did
not 30 minutes ago when you called.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.480
Sure. Okay.

30:15.564 --> 30:19.275
You know, you could have gone on ahead
and let yourself in.

30:19.818 --> 30:24.447
Wade, you remember way back
when the miners struck Tremmins Power?

30:24.698 --> 30:25.948
Yes, sir.

30:26.575 --> 30:31.829
Well, one day, some company gun thugs
came to our house, looking for my uncle,

30:31.914 --> 30:35.166
my mother's younger brother,
living with us at the time.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.836
They came across the street, five of them,
a couple carrying pick handles,

30:38.921 --> 30:41.756
and they walk up on the porch,
where my mother stood.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.009
They said they wanted to see her brother,
the agitator.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.762
They said they wanted
to set his thinking cap on straight for him.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.138
She said he wasn't here.

30:49.223 --> 30:51.891
They said they intended
on looking inside anyway.

30:52.809 --> 30:55.478
Well, I come out the screen door
to stand with my mother.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.688
And she looks at me

31:00.317 --> 31:02.443
like she'd given up all hope.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.948
But none of that was in her voice
when she told them,

31:07.032 --> 31:09.951
"You don't walk in a person's home
unless you're invited."

31:11.745 --> 31:16.165
Would it be all right with you
if I went in just to change my shirt?

31:17.292 --> 31:18.709
You don't want to know
what happened next?

31:18.794 --> 31:20.086
Well, of course. Yeah.

31:20.170 --> 31:23.214
They knocked my mother aside,
used the pick handles to put me down,

31:23.298 --> 31:25.299
went in and out the back empty-handed.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.345
I guess my point is

31:30.138 --> 31:34.433
that there's been plenty of rules
I've forgotten or discarded over the years,

31:35.310 --> 31:36.602
but that one's always stuck.

31:42.359 --> 31:47.363
I appreciate you coming out here to get me,
especially after all that went on with Dickie.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.574
I'm awful sorry about all that.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.660
I mean, he just showed up.
I didn't know what else to do.

31:52.786 --> 31:54.870
Just consider it
water under the bridge, Wade.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.581
Well, yeah, yeah.

31:56.665 --> 32:00.251
And then I heard that you got to little Loretta
just in time that same day,

32:00.335 --> 32:04.839
and I just want you to realize
that when I decided I was gonna help her,

32:04.923 --> 32:07.758
I had no idea what she had intended to do.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.093
Yep.

32:09.177 --> 32:13.848
I suspect it'd be difficult to tell
without the proper context.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.600
Damn it!

32:20.856 --> 32:23.065
- You didn't change your shirt.
- No.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.651
Was it 'cause you went in the house
looking for this?

32:26.194 --> 32:28.321
I thought you wasn't gonna go inside!

32:30.032 --> 32:32.241
We all got lines we got to cross, Wade.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.953
- Well, what about that part...
- What the hell happened to you, Wade?

32:36.038 --> 32:38.039
- Shit.
- Raylan, I don't know.

32:38.123 --> 32:41.292
It's these pills.
I'm not myself. It's just... It's not my fault.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.002
Well, tell that to the judge and the jury.

32:43.086 --> 32:46.964
Well, it don't have to go to that, does it?
I mean, we're old friends, aren't we?

32:47.049 --> 32:50.134
Friends?
You strung me up and left me for dead.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.844
I thought that was water under the bridge.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.138
Now you come here
looking to put a bullet in me.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.974
Honestly, I think I was
just gonna put a bullet in me.

32:57.559 --> 33:00.019
I'll tell you what I want to know, Wade.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.896
After you shot me,

33:02.773 --> 33:04.190
what was you supposed to do next?

33:09.571 --> 33:11.197
- Is he dead?
- He is.

33:11.615 --> 33:12.740
But I took a bullet.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.826
- What?
- Yeah, I been shot.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.621
Mr. Fogle, I need help.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.123
Okay.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.500
Be there shortly.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.377
Yeah, if... He hung up.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.671
What happened? He get him?

33:29.341 --> 33:32.218
Grab some guns and ammo from out front.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.029
Messer?

33:56.451 --> 33:57.576
Wade?

33:58.495 --> 33:59.537
Where you at?

34:08.922 --> 34:10.089
Fogle.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.592
Marshal.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.886
- You're looking well.
- Well, thanks.

34:15.971 --> 34:17.388
Feel pretty good.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.266
I bet you're looking for Wade Messer.

34:20.350 --> 34:23.310
- You haven't seen him, have you?
- Yeah.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.647
He's right there,
handcuffed in the backseat of my car.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.109
Not true. Whatever he's been telling you.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.860
Well, he sounded pretty convincing.

34:31.945 --> 34:34.739
Come on. You're not gonna take
an addict's word for it.

34:34.822 --> 34:39.493
I think the question you should ask
is whether I care if you ride out of here

34:39.828 --> 34:44.915
cuffed in the back of my car
or get carried out of here in a coroner's bag.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.168
The answer is me
and dead owls don't give a hoot.

34:48.879 --> 34:50.087
You gonna shoot me?

34:50.172 --> 34:51.213
Look.

34:51.922 --> 34:56.092
I'll take out my gun and put a bullet through
your heart before you raise your weapon.

34:56.303 --> 35:00.181
Then I guess I got to wait for your partner
to finish sneaking around back.

35:00.348 --> 35:03.934
You tell him to step
on every twig and branch he passed?

35:05.061 --> 35:09.190
All right. You know he's there.
It's still two of us and one of you.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.525
More like one and a half.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.236
Look at him. He's stoned.

35:14.321 --> 35:15.738
What did you even bring him for?

35:15.822 --> 35:19.408
Hey, Marshal. Now, listen.

35:20.911 --> 35:23.245
Let's take it easy.

35:24.915 --> 35:27.291
All right, maybe there's another solution
to all this.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.376
Yeah? Put that down.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.880
Let's hear it.
I got somewhere else I want to be.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.632
Somewhere more important
than here with me?

35:35.050 --> 35:36.217
Thinking of buying a house.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.551
Really? What neighborhood?

35:37.636 --> 35:40.387
In the greater Lexington area of kiss my ass.

35:41.640 --> 35:46.060
What if I gave up some friends
up in Frankfort?

35:46.728 --> 35:48.062
Your friends got names?

35:48.355 --> 35:50.815
How about Wynn Duffy?

35:51.399 --> 35:53.067
I'd say we're getting somewhere.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.237
Now I just need you to put down your guns.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.281
You heard the man, there, Wally.
Put your gun down.

36:00.909 --> 36:04.912
You saying he can just make a deal
and skate,

36:04.996 --> 36:06.247
just after all the shit he's done?

36:06.331 --> 36:07.957
Put the gun down.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.417
Well, it's too bad you don't know
what's going on up in Frankfort,

36:10.502 --> 36:11.544
or you could make your own deal.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.671
I might not know
about what's going on up there,

36:13.755 --> 36:18.551
but I do know what he's doing down here,
like how he killed J.T. just for sport of it.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.344
Wally, you keep your mouth shut.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.347
Well, you know, Wade and I saw him do it.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.557
We buried him ourselves.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.976
- All right. Put the gun down.
- Marshal, listen.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.228
- Settle down.
- I am officially turning myself in,

36:29.312 --> 36:33.148
and I can guarantee you whatever
these two addicts are accusing me of,

36:33.233 --> 36:35.025
they are, in fact,
responsible for it themselves.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.277
Beckett, put that gun down.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.863
I'll turn myself in, Marshal,
long as you kill Fogle.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.739
All right, now, that's enough, both of you.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.491
Marshal ain't gonna shoot me,
you dumb shit. He needs me.

36:42.576 --> 36:44.285
Yeah? Well, he might not, but I will.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.828
Put your guns down, both of you.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.297
Messer! You got that phone on you?

36:56.548 --> 36:58.757
- Yeah.
- Dial 911.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.094
911.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.181
You let him shoot me.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.560
I can't die here.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.021
Shit!

37:13.982 --> 37:17.151
My cousin Johnny's securing us
the services of Jimmy and Rip.

37:18.153 --> 37:21.739
Well, it does seem those boys
are gonna be right at home.

37:26.661 --> 37:31.290
Did you ever approach Johnny
about taking part in the Commandos?

37:32.542 --> 37:35.961
Well, as much as cousin Johnny
likes guns and money,

37:36.046 --> 37:38.672
I don't think he ever
would have bought into the "why."

37:42.969 --> 37:45.220
I remember when you recruited me.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.390
Took me to that church, showed me your ink.

37:49.142 --> 37:51.644
I thought to myself,
"This here son of a bitch is crazy,

37:52.520 --> 37:55.064
"preaching race war in a goddamn church."

37:59.110 --> 38:04.531
But, boy, I never believed in anything
the way I did those Commandos.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.034
Yes, sir.

38:08.536 --> 38:12.289
You know,
and then your Marshal friend shot you.

38:13.708 --> 38:14.750
It all turned.

38:16.544 --> 38:19.546
Some said you'd gotten religion.

38:20.966 --> 38:24.635
Others said you'd gone crazy,
betrayed your father,

38:24.719 --> 38:28.305
- all them people hanging out in the woods.
- Devil, what are you looking for here?

38:32.018 --> 38:37.022
I just want to know which Boyd Crowder
I'm being asked to follow.

38:39.067 --> 38:45.406
Well, what if I told you I was the man
that recruited you in that church?

38:47.993 --> 38:50.744
But then I also told you
I was a man who got shot?

38:52.080 --> 38:53.330
Who found God?

38:54.541 --> 38:57.376
Who betrayed his father?

39:00.463 --> 39:02.464
That I was a man who killed men

39:03.842 --> 39:06.427
and gotten a whole bunch of men killed?

39:08.763 --> 39:14.977
See, Devil, I can't discard my past
any more than I can these tattoos.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.983
Now, I told you what I'm offering.

39:23.236 --> 39:25.237
There ain't nothing more.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.284
Boyd.

39:36.458 --> 39:37.624
I'm in.

39:38.293 --> 39:43.380
When I was kid, my old man wouldn't let
us watch <i>Mister Rogers</i> or <i>Sesame Street.</i>

39:44.424 --> 39:45.716
He made us watch <i>Taxi Driver.</i>

39:46.676 --> 39:51.513
Now, you might think that this thing is great,
but it has to be perfect every time.

39:52.474 --> 39:54.224
If it jams, I am screwed.

39:55.852 --> 39:58.479
This is version 3.0.

40:01.149 --> 40:02.191
Where'd you get the track?

40:02.692 --> 40:04.234
It's funny you should ask that.

40:04.319 --> 40:07.029
Actually, I was Christmas-tree
shopping with...

40:08.114 --> 40:09.698
Go check it out.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.292
Tell him we're fine.

40:21.169 --> 40:22.503
Tell him we're fine, asshole.

40:24.339 --> 40:26.006
We're fine, Mike!

40:26.925 --> 40:29.259
Howdy. That's a big gun.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.345
I'm unarmed.

40:32.514 --> 40:35.766
Stand up, turn around
and put your hands in the air.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.062
You move, I'll shoot you in the back.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.190
How may we help you, Marshal?

40:44.651 --> 40:46.902
Remember that conversation
we weren't gonna have?

40:53.118 --> 40:54.159
This is it.

40:55.245 --> 40:58.080
The pawn-shop owner's dead,
along with his flunky.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.832
I found another one
in a shallow resting spot.

40:59.916 --> 41:02.543
I don't give a shit.
I don't give a shit 'cause I know it was you

41:02.627 --> 41:04.795
that called the shot on me, Duffy. I know.

41:04.879 --> 41:08.423
I know, just like I know it's no accident that
Emmitt Arnett and his assistant are missing.

41:09.217 --> 41:10.551
Look here.

41:14.681 --> 41:15.973
Next one's coming faster.

41:21.062 --> 41:24.898
How fast do you think those bullets will be
when they're heading back at you?
