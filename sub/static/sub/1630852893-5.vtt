WEBVTT

00:21.396 --> 00:22.814
<i>Bonne nuit!</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:29.654
-Hey!
-Hey.

00:29.738 --> 00:30.697
How was dinner?

00:30.780 --> 00:33.908
It was really fun. Jerome cooked,
and then Adrian was showing us--

00:33.992 --> 00:35.118
Dr. Mallory?

00:35.201 --> 00:37.912
Um, he told me to call him Adrian.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.540
He was showing us his Africa scrapbooks.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.333
You know he's lived in 11 countries?

00:42.417 --> 00:44.461
-No, I didn't.
-He's so cool.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.087
We… We watched <i>The Last Dance.</i>

00:46.171 --> 00:47.464
We drank yerba mate tea.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.966
-It's like a… like a green tea but cool.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.886
You know what I mean? Yeah.
Anyway, you know what's really weird?

00:52.969 --> 00:55.555
-Mmm?
-Dennis Rodman and Madonna dated.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.599
-You know about that?
-Yeah. I did know about that.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.601
-So weird.
-Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Come here.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.062
You said you were going to be home early

01:02.145 --> 01:03.897
so you could prep
for your interview tomorrow.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.524
Yes. The interview.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.776
Yes. At Colorado College.

01:07.859 --> 01:11.362
Honey, this is a big deal.
I want you to take this seriously.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.906
I do take this seriously.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.991
I want you to head right upstairs,
go to bed.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.369
I want you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
so you really crush it in the morning.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.872
-Okay.
-Because you are going to crush it.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.458
-I'll try.
-No, no. Don't try, do.

01:23.541 --> 01:24.959
Honey? Honey, come here.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.505
I wanna hear you say it.
"I'm going to crush it."

01:30.465 --> 01:32.675
-I'm going to crush this.
-I can't hear you.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.636
I'm gonna crush it!

01:34.719 --> 01:38.139
All right. I'd like you to say that
a hundred times before you go to bed.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.557
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.519
-I'm gonna crush it.
-That's one.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.437
-I'm going to crush it.
-Two.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.147
-I'm goin' to crush it.
-Three.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.109
Hey, Dad, guess what I'm going
to do tomorrow? I'm gonna crush it!

01:49.192 --> 01:51.361
-I'm a good dad.
-Gonna crush this.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.154
I know what the hell I'm doing.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.073
<i>No, you're screwing this up. Okay?</i>

01:55.156 --> 01:58.326
<i>I can't guide Erin through</i>
<i>the college application process, okay?</i>

01:58.409 --> 02:00.120
<i>Because I'm, well, here.</i>

02:00.203 --> 02:03.081
Yeah, well, I'm prepping her,
and she's gonna crush it.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.625
<i>-Is she, Mark? Is she gonna crush it?</i>
-Yeah, she is.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.835
<i>Well, she better. Okay?</i>

02:06.918 --> 02:10.922
<i>Because I kept her on track for 16 years.</i>
<i>She was top of her class.</i>

02:11.005 --> 02:13.049
<i>-Okay? Then you moved us to Wild Horse.</i>
-Oh.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.009
-Here we go.
<i>-And the wheels fell off the bus.</i>

02:15.093 --> 02:17.637
-Uh-huh.
<i>-You asked for sole custody.</i>

02:17.720 --> 02:19.264
<i>And you got it, so, you know,</i>

02:19.347 --> 02:21.057
<i>-this is all on you.</i>
-Oh-ho-ho!

02:21.141 --> 02:24.519
We're talking about custody?
Oh, sure, I got sole custody.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.855
You know why? Because you're <i>in</i> custody.

02:26.938 --> 02:27.814
Ah-ha!

02:27.897 --> 02:32.277
<i>Once again, you turn</i>
<i>a pleasant conversation hostile.</i>

02:32.360 --> 02:33.403
<i>Classic Mark.</i>

02:33.903 --> 02:35.071
No, don't… don't--

02:35.155 --> 02:37.782
Oh! I thought I heard Maggie.
How the heck are you, Mags?

02:37.866 --> 02:41.244
<i>Hey, Brad! Great. Great.</i>
<i>I'm getting an accounting degree.</i>

02:41.327 --> 02:43.288
<i>And I got a pet rat.</i>

02:43.371 --> 02:44.831
-Excellent--
-Brad, do you mind?

02:44.914 --> 02:47.041
Oh, okay. Uh, well, love to Louise.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.459
And, General, they're here.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.461
Mags, I gotta go.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.047
Got a meeting
with an energy drink company.

02:53.131 --> 02:56.217
-Can we finish this later?
<i>-Sure, yeah, no, that sounds important.</i>

02:56.301 --> 02:57.594
Wha-- Okay.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.311
What? What are you…
What are you doing?

03:06.394 --> 03:07.645
Are you hiding?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.689
Just tying my shoe.

03:09.772 --> 03:12.233
Oh, okay. That's very weird.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.401
Why is this weird?

03:13.484 --> 03:16.112
Shoes get tied every day,
all over the world.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.072
You're just behind a security desk.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.909
-You think I'm, like, hiding from you?
-I don't know what you're doing.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.952
-Don't give yourself that much credit.
-I'm not.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.205
You're the one being weird.
What are you doing?

03:25.288 --> 03:27.040
Gonna tie the other shoe
if you wanna watch.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.834
I don't give a damn what you do.
Fuckin' tie your shoe, tie both,

03:29.918 --> 03:30.793
don't wear any shoes!

03:30.877 --> 03:34.505
You care about his fucking shoes?
I can't believe you're acting like this.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.717
Buddy, you can stay here
as long as you need to.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.177
Thanks.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.847
These people are gonna be absolutely--
General Naird!

03:42.931 --> 03:46.392
This is Audrey Haller, the Senior Director
of Marketing over at Mad Buff.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.187
Nice to meet you. And thanks
for sponsoring this year's event.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.022
Oh my God, the timing couldn't be better.

03:51.105 --> 03:53.358
Your parent company
wants to expand their demo.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.694
Meanwhile, we're looking for a cool brand
to get some extra funding.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.990
This is like a romantic comedy,
but there is no annoying best friend.

04:01.574 --> 04:05.119
Well, a Battle Bot competition
is very much on-brand for us.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.621
Us too.

04:06.704 --> 04:07.622
Us too.

04:07.705 --> 04:11.542
"Battle" and "bots" are probably,
like, the most popular words said here.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.669
That, and like "science."

04:12.752 --> 04:14.879
Lot of people say "science,"
then "battle" and "bots."

04:14.963 --> 04:17.507
-We're basically the same company.
That is not true.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.342
I mean, uh, listen to this though.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.720
Their catchphrase is
"Mad Buff gives you mad confidence."

04:22.804 --> 04:25.890
Well, "confidence" is a word
we're familiar with in the military.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.309
But confidence without arrogance.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.021
I am a fan of football players
who don't do an end-zone dance,

04:32.105 --> 04:34.190
who quietly celebrate a job well done.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.234
-Yeah. I love that too. I love that.
-Yes.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.404
But I also love the celebrations.
You kidding me? I love 'em.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.948
I'd watch a whole game
where they're going like this all day.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.033
What's going on?
I don't even care what the score is.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.868
This is going amazing.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.704
Does anybody feel like they're flying?

04:47.787 --> 04:50.498
I feel like I'm levitating off the ground
and looking at this.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.375
And we get General Naird for the promo.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.169
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not going to happen.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.838
Just, like, a tiny promo.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.673
-Nope. Nope.
-It's just-- Well, it's just--

04:58.756 --> 05:00.466
Eeh… Ehh…

05:00.550 --> 05:02.593
We are contributing $300,000.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.720
300K, General.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.306
Yeah, okay. I suppose we could discuss it.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.726
Just as long as
I don't have to say or do anything

05:09.809 --> 05:13.062
that would compromise the integrity
of Space Force or the US military.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.273
-Baby Bear's got you covered, Papa Bear.
-Don't do that.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.441
-Last time.
-Nice to meet you.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.942
-You too.
-Great. So good to see you.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.903
What is up with you?
You're agitated more than usual.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.655
I drank a little Mad Buff. I'm jittery.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.365
I also feel like I can see sounds.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.618
Sir, can I talk to you for a second?
Come on, man, just hear me out.

05:27.702 --> 05:28.703
I didn't say anything.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.080
Right, sorry.
I just assumed you would say no.

05:31.164 --> 05:35.460
What about this? What if this thing
with Mad Buff isn't just a one-off?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.754
What if it's an ongoing
business relationship

05:37.837 --> 05:39.797
between Space Force and Mad Buff?

05:39.881 --> 05:42.592
I mean, that would solve
so much of our money problems.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.470
You're grinding your teeth. It's gross.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.013
Sorry, I can't… I can't stop it.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.766
But if Sec Def saw
that we were able to raise these funds,

05:49.849 --> 05:52.101
there is a chance that Sec Def matches it.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.563
Hell, we may be able to even
restart Dr. Mallory's Mars mission.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.524
"Dr. Mallory's Mars mission."
Do you hear that? "Mallory's Mars…"

05:58.608 --> 06:02.028
Tony, the Mars mission's
going to cost four billion dollars.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.863
It's a start. Picture it for a second.

06:03.946 --> 06:07.367
Commander Lancaster lands on Mars,
gets out, looks around, says,

06:07.450 --> 06:10.203
"One small step for man… Oh, what's this?"

06:10.286 --> 06:14.957
"One giant swig of the number three
energy drink in the continental US."

06:15.541 --> 06:17.502
Know what?
I don't really care about the money,

06:17.585 --> 06:20.963
but showing initiative to the Sec Def,
that could be good.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.215
Why don't you work on this?

06:22.298 --> 06:24.759
-Let me know if there's any merit in it.
-Thank you, sir!

06:26.677 --> 06:28.388
-No! Stop that!
-You got it!

06:29.889 --> 06:34.394
Welcome, future engineers,
to the Battle Bots competition.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.561
Mentees and scientists,

06:35.645 --> 06:40.066
please bring your robots to the front desk
for certification and instruction.

06:40.149 --> 06:44.821
-Yeah. Then there was another A-210.
-'Cause I think the ratio has to be exact.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.741
That's Drummer Moon Girl. Can we go over?
I took up the drums because of her.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.078
-Oh, I don't think we're--
-You don't know her?

06:52.578 --> 06:55.790
Oh, I <i>know </i>her. Of course I know her.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.126
Come on.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.169
Wasn't it 2.5
the last time you checked?

07:00.253 --> 07:01.838
-2.4.
-It has to be exact--

07:01.921 --> 07:05.258
Uh, Captain Angela Ali,
I want you to meet Jill, my mentee.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.759
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.845
I like your robot.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.054
Oh, thank you. Me too.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.014
Hmm. It's nice.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.143
Six smooth, flat surfaces.
An impenetrable box.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.353
You see, the idea here, Jill,

07:17.437 --> 07:20.690
is to not let anyone in,
hiding from the outside world

07:20.773 --> 07:23.484
and leaving your opponents very confused.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.571
I don't know, Jill. Some things
aren't as <i>simple</i> as they seem.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.657
This has many inner-workings, in fact,
that you know nothing about.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.326
If your enemy doesn't take the time
to understand your robot,

07:32.410 --> 07:34.120
he's going to lose.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.500
-Well, somebody's gotta lose, right?
-I wonder who?

07:39.584 --> 07:42.044
Oh, this is gonna be a fun day, Jill.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.172
Why don't you say goodbye
to the nice lady?

07:44.672 --> 07:45.882
-Bye.
-Bye.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.428
What the heck was that?

07:50.511 --> 07:52.889
It's just, you know, Battle Bots.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.390
You know what? Mind your business.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.935
-Is everything okay, Dr. Chan?

07:58.019 --> 07:58.936
No, Jill.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.355
Let's just win.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.191
Erin, there's no need to be anxious.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.401
-Oh, I'm gonna blow this interview.
-No, you won't.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.069
-My dad's gonna kill me.
-No, he won't.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.779
Were you nervous when you applied?

08:08.863 --> 08:12.825
See, I never applied. I… I was recruited.

08:13.409 --> 08:16.621
But not everyone needs to go to college.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.206
Erin does, Dr. Mallory.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.457
Hi, honey.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.500
Hey.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.418
You ready?

08:22.502 --> 08:25.588
Hey, do you think, um,
Adrian can help me with the interview?

08:25.671 --> 08:26.881
For moral support?

08:26.964 --> 08:29.091
I mean, normally, Mom would be here,

08:30.301 --> 08:31.594
-but…
-Um…

08:33.346 --> 08:38.518
I… I'd be delighted to help if you would
like me to stay, Mark. If you don't mind.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.604
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Yeah, that sounds great. More the merrier.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.606
-All right, here we go.
-Okay.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.066
Here's a sample question.

08:45.775 --> 08:49.487
Erin, why do you want
to attend Colorado College?

08:50.404 --> 08:53.824
Because it is close enough to my dad
that he can keep an eye on me

08:53.908 --> 08:55.576
without repurposing a satellite.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.578
-Hmm. Okay. Very cute.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.164
The real response would be something like,

09:00.248 --> 09:04.210
"I want to establish
a strong academic foundation

09:04.293 --> 09:06.337
for a subsequent advanced degree

09:06.420 --> 09:09.298
that will lead
to a satisfying professional career."

09:09.382 --> 09:10.508
Or words to that effect.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.552
They don't have to be these words,
but words…

09:12.635 --> 09:13.970
-May I?
-You could use these words.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.137
-That's fine.
-May I butt in?

09:15.221 --> 09:18.849
-Because I've worked in academia.
-Of course. Yeah, yeah, go for it.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.476
So, I just have a small suggestion.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.771
Were I Erin, I would simply say,

09:23.854 --> 09:27.692
"I want to go to Colorado College
to learn."

09:27.775 --> 09:29.318
-"To find my path."
-Mmm.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.486
Great advice, but I--

09:30.570 --> 09:33.656
And it's only
in the undertaking of the journey

09:33.739 --> 09:35.533
that we find where the journey leads.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.077
Yes, Dr. Mallory is very well-intentioned,

09:38.160 --> 09:40.329
but your mother and I
are responsible for you,

09:40.413 --> 09:44.917
and we have thought a lot
about your journey from birth.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.336
-From birth we have.
-Of course you have. Point taken.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.839
-The two of us. Her mother and I.
-Of course. Yes.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.340
-Of course.
-May I proceed?

09:51.424 --> 09:52.758
Project confidence.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.554
Confidence is the single most
determining factor of success.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.140
Okay, but what if
I'm actually really nervous?

09:59.223 --> 10:01.601
No, no, no, no, no! Don't be nervous.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.812
-Relax! Relax, Erin.
-How am I supposed to relax?

10:04.895 --> 10:05.771
Okay, all right.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.356
Now I'm even more nervous. Great.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.235
Another question they might ask is,
"Where do you see yourself in ten years?"

10:11.319 --> 10:13.404
I don't know!

10:13.487 --> 10:15.573
No, no! Don't… Don't say you don't know.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.701
-Do <i>you </i>know where you'll be in ten years?
-That's not the point.

10:18.784 --> 10:19.744
-Mark.
-Yes?

10:19.827 --> 10:22.079
I mean, were I the interviewer,

10:22.163 --> 10:25.416
I would find her response
refreshingly honest.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.251
The answer to that question is,

10:27.335 --> 10:32.548
"In four years, I see myself
graduating from this college with honors."

10:33.132 --> 10:34.675
Boom. Mic drop.

10:34.759 --> 10:35.676
Mmm!

10:35.760 --> 10:37.803
-What's that?
-That's called the "dab."

10:37.887 --> 10:39.138
The dab?

10:41.349 --> 10:43.142
Mad Buff gives you mad confidence.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.269
I love it. You nailed it. Movin' on.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.729
-Again?
-Again. One more.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.690
Thank you.
Um, even more confident.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.234
Mad Buff gives you mad confidence.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.111
-I think we got it.
-I <i>know </i>we got it.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.656
That oozed confidence.
I think we're movin' on, right?

10:56.739 --> 10:58.449
It was just a little bit louder, so…

10:58.532 --> 10:59.825
-Absolutely louder.
-Right?

10:59.909 --> 11:02.328
Could you put the can
closer to your face, please?

11:02.411 --> 11:04.914
I mean, it's almost touching my cheek.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.917
Press the skin. It's a Mad Buff meme
called "Pressing the Buff."

11:08.000 --> 11:10.586
-Yeah, no, I'm not gonna do that.
-He's not gonna do that.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.298
I think that looks amazing.
He looks strong. He looks like a man.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.967
Yeah. Okay, I guess
we can make that one work.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.136
-All right. Thank you so much.
-Thank you, General.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.596
Watch out, movie star.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.890
-No, no, no. No, you turn that off.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.476
Permission to film denied.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.603
That is an order.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.314
Hey, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

11:30.398 --> 11:32.566
See, I've ruined it.
You can't use that now.

11:36.445 --> 11:40.533
Welcome to the annual
Wild Horse Student Robotics Fair!

11:40.616 --> 11:44.328
Sponsored by Space Force
and Mad Buff energy drink.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.289
The only drink
that gives you mad confidence.

11:49.583 --> 11:53.838
In the first match:
Kill your robots? Yes, they can.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.841
-Give it up for Jill and Chan!
-Whoo!

11:57.425 --> 11:59.385
And their opponents.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.554
He's a thinker, not a smiler.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.515
Give it up for Dr. Xyler.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.059
And Doug. And Doug.

12:08.769 --> 12:09.603
Let's do it!

12:10.354 --> 12:11.897
Go right at him! Yes!

12:11.981 --> 12:13.691
Go left. Go around him. Go around him.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.234
Reverse! Reverse! Reverse!

12:16.277 --> 12:17.862
Ooh. Yes! One more, one more! Go, go, go.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.363
Oh no! No! No!

12:20.698 --> 12:22.742
-Yes!
-Goddamnit, Doug!

12:24.452 --> 12:25.536
Yes!

12:26.746 --> 12:28.956
And the winner is
Jill and Dr. Chan!

12:29.039 --> 12:31.459
Whoo! Sorry you suck, Xyler!

12:31.542 --> 12:32.376
Shut up, Chan.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.795
Doug, get a better mentor next year.

12:34.879 --> 12:35.796
Whoo!

12:45.055 --> 12:45.931
Erin.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.852
Oh my God. What are you doing?

12:49.935 --> 12:52.646
Just wanna give you some advice,
but you didn't hear it from me.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.190
I know your father means well,

12:54.273 --> 12:57.193
but I think you have
to speak from the heart

12:57.276 --> 12:58.944
and trust that they will see

12:59.028 --> 13:02.490
what an exceptional
young woman you are, Erin.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.700
And above all, you have to relax.

13:05.910 --> 13:09.079
Yes. At least you guys
can both agree on that.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.707
Because, you see,
everything does not hang on this.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.626
Very little actually does.

13:13.709 --> 13:17.296
And if you wanna take a year off
to travel before college, do it.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.465
-I do know people who did that.
-Yes, you do.

13:19.548 --> 13:24.345
Me. In my gap year,
I saw the wonders of the classical world.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.555
-Greece, Rome, Egypt.
-Cool.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.226
And that trip was also
my sexual awakening.

13:30.309 --> 13:34.647
I mean,
I barely paid for a meal or a hotel room

13:34.730 --> 13:37.149
from Algiers to Königsberg.

13:37.983 --> 13:38.943
Wow.

13:39.026 --> 13:39.944
That's…

13:40.945 --> 13:42.738
That's really something. Thank you.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.116
-Yeah. It was incredible.
-Yeah, I'm su-- Yes. Okay.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.703
Wait. I'm… I'm stuck.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.498
-Erin. My sweater.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.417
Think I'll get something
from the vending machine.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.877
Mark, is that you?

13:58.128 --> 14:01.632
Maybe the Harvest Cheddar.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.009
Mark, can you help me out of here?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.386
-Mmm.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.137
-Mark.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.057
-Oh…
-Mark, don't do this.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.602
-Oh, boy, oh, boy, those look good.
-Mark.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.856
-Mark.
-Yummy.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.898
Mark.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.699
-Siri, call Dr. Chan.

14:26.782 --> 14:30.411
-Welcome to the finals!

14:30.494 --> 14:33.747
Our competitors tonight,
two of my favorite people on planet Earth.

14:33.831 --> 14:38.961
From snowy Honolulu,
give it up for Captain Angela Ali!

14:39.044 --> 14:43.173
And from the exotic paradise
that is northeastern Ohio,

14:43.257 --> 14:45.509
give it up for Dr. Chan!

14:45.593 --> 14:48.262
Again, this is all brought to you
by Mad Buff.

14:48.345 --> 14:51.974
A stampede of "hell yeah" in every sip.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.810
Oh, and their mentees
are Jill-someone and Rowan.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.898
At my signal…

14:59.899 --> 15:01.317
Let's get it on!

15:04.445 --> 15:05.905


15:05.988 --> 15:07.531
Go right at it. We're gonna crush this!

15:08.866 --> 15:09.783
You got this. Go!

15:11.243 --> 15:12.953
Wipe that smug smile off her face.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.539
She knows she couldn't have gone
to the moon without me.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.625
What are you doing?
Not the time or place, Chan.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.418
Then bring your pathetic box this way.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.463
I can't believe you're doing this now.
But fine. If you wanna go, we can go.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.215
If you're so good at breaking hearts,
try breaking this. Huh?

15:25.299 --> 15:27.509
Breaking hearts? What?
You knew what was up.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.511
I was honest with you from the beginning.

15:29.595 --> 15:33.349
You don't even know what you want, okay?
You were the one who pursued me first.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.352
So? Then you wouldn't stop pursuing me.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.104
This is ridiculous, Chan.
You were the best sex I ever had.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.483
-Really?
-Dr. Chan, it's a trap!

15:51.951 --> 15:54.495
Brad! Brad! That's a foul!

15:54.578 --> 15:57.247
That's a flagrant foul. Do something.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.959
Uh, ten, nine, eight, seven…

16:00.042 --> 16:02.878
-No! It's not over.
-…six, five, four, three…

16:02.962 --> 16:05.839
-I don't want this one to be over! No!
-…two, one, it is over!

16:05.923 --> 16:06.924
No!

16:07.007 --> 16:09.385
-Angela is never taking him back!

16:09.468 --> 16:10.719
We did it!

16:10.803 --> 16:13.472
And we have a winner!

16:13.555 --> 16:16.600
The grand prize goes to Team Cube.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.228
And here to present the trophy,

16:19.311 --> 16:23.440
Instagram's biggest "BILF," Mad Buffy!

16:30.197 --> 16:33.367
-It's… Okay.
-No, I can do it. Just send to screen.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.078
Hold on. Oh, there we go. Hello.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.414
<i>Hello, Erin. I'm Professor Yaffe.</i>

16:38.998 --> 16:40.040
Hello there.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.251
Just wanted to say good luck, Erin.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.879
My goodness. I didn't realize
the interview was already starting.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.464
I'm so sorry. I'm Dr. Mallory.

16:47.548 --> 16:51.885
Erin has been interning
with the science team here at Space Force.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.679
She is a very intelligent young woman.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.305
-Yes, well…
-Exceptionally clever.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.224
We'll let you do your interview.

16:57.307 --> 17:00.686
Sorry, I just wanted to say
good luck, Erin. Good luck.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.146
<i>Are these all your parents?</i>

17:02.229 --> 17:05.190
-Oh, no. I don't have three dads.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.776
<i>Well, it's okay if you do.</i>

17:07.860 --> 17:10.529
<i>Colorado College</i>
<i>is a very inclusive institution.</i>

17:10.612 --> 17:12.114
-Very well.
-Oh, that's nice.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.866
-Okay.
-Well, I only have one dad.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.951
-This one… This one is my dad.
-Hello.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.371
General Naird. He's the commander
here at Space Force.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.790
-That doesn't--
-And these two, they're just my friends.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.002
I'm almost like a relative.
Not by blood, but soul. We're close.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.296
You're just confusing her.
Thank you so much.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.590
-Yes.

17:29.673 --> 17:30.966
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.802
<i>It's wonderful to meet you, Erin.</i>

17:33.886 --> 17:36.513
<i>I'd like to get to know you</i>
<i>a little bit better.</i>

17:36.597 --> 17:39.433
<i>What is something</i>
<i>everyone should know about you?</i>

17:42.144 --> 17:44.480
What an unbelievable day.

17:44.563 --> 17:48.108
Look at these participants,
but there can only be one winner.

17:48.192 --> 17:52.362
Give it up for Rowan Martin
and Captain Angela Ali!

17:52.446 --> 17:53.822
Thank you. Ooh! Mine!

17:54.782 --> 17:55.616
Thank you!

17:55.699 --> 17:57.910
This is better than going to the moon.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.328
Uh, can I hold the trophy?

17:59.411 --> 18:00.496
I'm sorry. Yes.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.122
What's up with you and Dr. Chan?

18:02.206 --> 18:04.708
Absolutely nothing is up
with me and Dr. Chan, nosy.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.794
I'm friends with all my exes.

18:10.714 --> 18:11.965
What is taking so long?

18:12.049 --> 18:15.761
Well, maybe it's a good thing.
Chatting away, lost in conversation.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.221
She's not the chatty type.

18:17.304 --> 18:20.891
Well, she was quite the storyteller
last night at dinner.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.476
Really?

18:22.559 --> 18:24.561
Yeah, but of course
I think it's easier for them

18:24.645 --> 18:27.689
to open up to an adult
who's not their parent.

18:27.773 --> 18:28.816
I suppose.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.151
Oh.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.612
Hey! How'd it go?

18:33.695 --> 18:36.115
You can cross
Colorado College off the list.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.952
What the hell happened?

18:40.828 --> 18:44.081
You know what? I know someone there.
I'm gonna make a phone call.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.793
This might actually
work out, Scarapiducci.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.545
Oh, I want it to work out.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.505
Take a look at this.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.301
We roughed up a quick promo.
You are going to love it.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.302
I can't wait.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.889
<i>When the murder robots come for you,</i>

19:00.973 --> 19:02.808
<i>-what are you gonna do?</i>

19:02.891 --> 19:04.434
<i> Mad Buff!</i>

19:04.518 --> 19:07.354
-Mad Buff gives you mad confidence.
-<i>More energy!</i>

19:07.437 --> 19:09.189
-Mad confidence.
<i>More caffeine!</i>

19:09.273 --> 19:10.858
-Mad confidence.
-<i>And an extra dose of…</i>

19:10.941 --> 19:12.151
Mad, mad, mad confidence.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.403
<i>It will drive you insane!</i>

19:14.486 --> 19:15.654


19:15.737 --> 19:17.573
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah!

19:17.656 --> 19:19.158
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.451
How much do you love it?

19:22.411 --> 19:23.370
Oh.

19:24.454 --> 19:25.747
Um…

19:25.831 --> 19:27.583
Hey, Ron, it's Adrian Mallory.

19:27.666 --> 19:31.211
I just wanted to follow up
about Erin's interview.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.923
<i>I checked in with Professor Yaffe</i>
<i>quietly, like you asked.</i>

19:35.007 --> 19:36.592
How badly did she tank it?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.010
And what did she say?

19:38.552 --> 19:40.387
<i>Yaffe said, and I quote,</i>

19:40.470 --> 19:42.890
<i>"It was the best display</i>
<i>of character and confidence</i>

19:42.973 --> 19:45.851
<i>I have seen in an interview in 35 years."</i>

19:45.934 --> 19:47.311
-Really?
Really?

19:47.394 --> 19:48.228
<i>Really.</i>

19:48.312 --> 19:52.274
<i>I mean, how often does a person her age</i>
<i>say she's not mature enough for college</i>

19:52.357 --> 19:54.276
<i>and won't apply until she's ready?</i>

19:54.359 --> 19:56.737
<i>Very smart and very self-aware.</i>

19:56.820 --> 19:57.946
I see.

19:58.030 --> 20:02.159
<i>Someone like that will be a success</i>
<i>in life, no matter what they do.</i>

20:02.659 --> 20:03.952
Well, I'll be damned.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.289
-There you go, enjoy. Congratulations.
-Awesome, thank you.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.124
All right.
We got another scoop of vanilla?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.794
-Okay…
-Would you like me to get you a spoon?

20:12.878 --> 20:15.130
-Kinda reminds me of--
-Strawberry Shortcake?

20:15.214 --> 20:18.425
-Yes. Yes! That's it.
-Mm-hmm.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.012
General, may I talk to you for a second?

20:22.095 --> 20:22.930
Uh…

20:23.013 --> 20:26.099
-Sure.
-<i>It will drive you insane!</i>

20:26.183 --> 20:28.060
<i>Blah, blah, blah,</i>
<i>blah, blah, blah, blah</i>!

20:28.143 --> 20:29.269
<i> Blah, blah…</i>

20:29.353 --> 20:30.854
Sweet Jesus.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.899
Well, that is a giant turd sandwich.

20:33.982 --> 20:34.816
-I know.
-God.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.485
That's what they want to run as the promo.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.237
-No, no, no.
-I know. I wouldn't approve it.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.989
I didn't approve it. This is my version.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.703
<i>The United States Space Force</i>

20:46.787 --> 20:49.122
<i>and its generous corporate partners</i>

20:49.206 --> 20:51.959
<i>salute America's future scientists,</i>

20:52.042 --> 20:54.544
<i>astronauts, and engineers.</i>

20:54.628 --> 20:57.631
<i>-The heroes of tomorrow.</i>

21:02.761 --> 21:04.471
-I like that.

21:05.013 --> 21:09.393
But, uh, I'm assuming this is
gonna hurt the partnership with Mad Buff?

21:10.310 --> 21:12.813
-Then it's not the partnership for us.
-Mmm.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.401
I'm proud of you, Anthony.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.527
Thank you.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.863
-That means a lot, Papa Bear.
-God…

21:21.947 --> 21:23.907
Too much. I pushed too much. I'm so sorry.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.659
Just this once.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.289
Here.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.416
-Thanks.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.918
It's gonna be okay, Dr. Chan.

21:35.419 --> 21:39.131
I know you wanted to win, but,
come on, second place is pretty good too.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.717
Oh yeah. I know.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.638
-Hey, bug.
-Hey.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.891
-Ooh. Banana split.
-Mm-hmm.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.894
I thought we only had the budget
for chocolate and vanilla.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.688
Oh, I had a good day in the stock market,

21:54.771 --> 21:57.107
so I gave Brad a couple hundred bucks
to step it up a little.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.191
Oh…
