TO GO.

25:52.886 --> 25:55.263
HERE WE ARE.
OH, CHILD.

25:55.430 --> 25:57.515
MA, I CAN'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING.

25:57.682 --> 26:00.477
YOU WILL.
WHEN THE TIME COMES.

26:00.644 --> 26:01.978
COME ON.
PUT YOUR BONNET ON.

26:06.024 --> 26:08.360
DO YOU SUPPOSE THE OTHERS
FEEL AS BAD AS I DO?

26:08.526 --> 26:10.654
YES. IT'S ONE
OF THE PROBLEMS

26:10.820 --> 26:13.240
THAT COMES
OF HAVING A MIND.

26:13.406 --> 26:14.824
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE?

26:14.991 --> 26:17.744
YES, DEAR.
I'VE FELT IT MANY TIMES.

26:17.911 --> 26:21.414
EACH TIME, I TELL MYSELF HOW
SILLY I'D BEEN TO FRET,

26:21.581 --> 26:25.377
BUT THE NEXT TIME,
THERE I'D GO AGAIN.

26:25.543 --> 26:29.172
THERE. NOW...

26:29.339 --> 26:31.132
YOU JUST DO YOUR BEST,

26:31.299 --> 26:34.135
AND NO ONE CAN ASK
ANY MORE OF YOU.

26:34.302 --> 26:35.470
I FEEL BETTER.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.597
GOOD.

26:37.764 --> 26:38.890
LET'S GO.

26:53.071 --> 26:55.282

26:59.786 --> 27:01.288

27:12.757 --> 27:15.719
HUH. THESE EGGS ARE
SMALLER THAN USUAL.

27:15.885 --> 27:18.054
THEY'RE THE SAME
AS ALWAYS.

27:18.221 --> 27:19.431
SMALLER.

27:19.597 --> 27:23.101
THEREFORE, I SHALL
PAY LESS FOR THEM.

27:23.268 --> 27:25.770
UM, 4 CENTS LESS.

27:25.937 --> 27:29.316
IN THAT CASE, I WILL JUST
TAKE THEM TO MR. HANSON.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.484
HE'S GOING TO SPRINGFIELD
TODAY, MY PA SAID,

27:31.651 --> 27:35.238

GOOD PRICE FOR THEM THERE.

27:35.405 --> 27:36.573
INDEED?

27:38.575 --> 27:40.910

27:41.077 --> 27:43.663

THE TROUBLE.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.623
I'LL PAY YOU THE
SAME PRICE AS USUAL,

27:45.790 --> 27:48.543
BUT THE NEXT TIME, YOU
PICK OUT LARGER EGGS.

27:54.049 --> 27:55.550
NOW, WILL THAT
BE CASH,

27:55.717 --> 27:57.510
OR SHALL I MARK IT
IN THE BOOK?

Nellie: THE WAR OF 1812
WAS CALLED MADISON'S WAR

31:31.182 --> 31:33.101
BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING THAT HAPPENED

31:33.268 --> 31:35.311
WHILE MR. MADISON
WAS PRESIDENT.

31:35.478 --> 31:39.357
IT WAS NAMED BY PEOPLE WHO DID NOT LIKE MR.

BUT MARY WOULD HAVE
DONE IT RIGHT.

38:07.036 --> 38:08.579

ANYTHING RIGHT.

40:16.207 --> 40:17.917
WHAT ARE YOU

40:21.170 --> 40:23.464
I JUST CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

40:23.631 --> 40:25.508
I BET YOU'LL BE GLAD
