00:15.094 --> 00:17.971
Yes! Closing time, let's go.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.321
Come on, move it or lose it.

00:19.401 --> 00:20.473
Oops, lost it.

00:22.213 --> 00:23.840
Ahh... Closing time.

00:24.025 --> 00:28.040
Are there two sweeter words
known to man or beast?

00:28.120 --> 00:29.588
Puppy love?

00:29.950 --> 00:30.756
Ka boom?

00:30.836 --> 00:35.133
Plutonium-fueled-DNA-mutating-
nature-abominating-monster maker.

00:36.493 --> 00:38.028
The first word was hyphenated.

00:38.108 --> 00:40.269
Yeah, great, all good.
But I'm sticking with...

00:40.349 --> 00:41.312
My dolly!

00:42.715 --> 00:43.297
Skipper?

00:43.377 --> 00:44.884
That wasn't me. It was...

00:44.964 --> 00:47.262
I lost my dolly. Help!

00:47.774 --> 00:50.494
Hot-molded plastic!
Dolly down!

00:50.574 --> 00:53.038
Rescue operation is go, go, go.

00:58.229 --> 00:59.429
Target acquired.

01:07.018 --> 01:10.053
My dolly!

01:10.133 --> 01:12.989
Kowalski, strike this one
from the Skipper's log.

01:18.342 --> 01:19.497
And her name...

01:19.577 --> 01:21.447
is Princess Pony Princess.

01:21.527 --> 01:23.194
And her favourite food...

01:23.768 --> 01:25.965
is sparkle glitter.

01:26.817 --> 01:28.891
Glit-ter.

01:28.971 --> 01:31.829
Great! And we are gonna do all we can

01:31.909 --> 01:35.173
to bring princess home
from the sewer, okay?

01:37.213 --> 01:38.360
Come on, sweetheart.

01:42.756 --> 01:45.587
Lost toy file and...

01:47.290 --> 01:49.766
Well, I've done all I can do.

01:50.739 --> 01:54.172
No little girl will shed a tear on my watch.

01:55.842 --> 01:59.371
Well, the chimps can crack the girl's address,
but that dolly could be anywhere

01:59.451 --> 02:02.036
in the 6000 miles of the
New York City sewer system.

02:02.116 --> 02:03.748
So, we'll have to split up.

02:03.828 --> 02:05.559
Let's see. That's...

02:06.373 --> 02:08.896
1500 miles of sewer each. Wow.

02:10.591 --> 02:12.258
That is a lot of sewer.

02:12.338 --> 02:13.767
What about a replacement dolly?

02:13.847 --> 02:16.785
We'd need an exact duplicate,
and where would we even find her?

02:27.938 --> 02:29.191
Perfect match.

02:29.465 --> 02:30.559
All we need is a dress.

02:30.639 --> 02:31.617
I'll get my sewing kit.

02:31.697 --> 02:32.914
I'll get the glitter glue.

02:38.302 --> 02:40.776
Oh, hey, it's your call, compadre.

02:40.856 --> 02:44.306
Just try not to think about
that weepy little miss

02:44.386 --> 02:48.308
with an empty place in her heart
where her dolly used to live.

02:53.889 --> 02:55.186
Way to go, Rico.

03:15.171 --> 03:16.530
You'll be okay, Rico.

03:16.716 --> 03:18.418
It's like my grandma always told me.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.920
you do a good deed,
and good comes back to you.

03:29.288 --> 03:31.538
Hello. Who's?..

03:32.474 --> 03:34.378
Princess Pony Princess.

03:34.811 --> 03:38.093
Mom, mom, she came back! Mom!

03:41.141 --> 03:44.212
Remember, Rico, good things
always come back around.

03:48.725 --> 03:50.613
No, Sally, you seen this?

03:50.843 --> 03:52.943
Hey, what's the number
of the animal control?

03:54.919 --> 03:56.723
Any warm fuzzy feelings yet?

04:02.376 --> 04:04.811
Well, the universe does still owe you one.

04:04.891 --> 04:06.400
I'm sure, any minute now.

04:09.231 --> 04:10.095
Sardines!

04:10.175 --> 04:11.614
Ooo, in cuttle size.

04:12.363 --> 04:14.401
See? Good things do come around.

04:18.536 --> 04:20.230
What in the name of pickled shnauzers?

04:25.100 --> 04:27.121
She is beautiful.

04:39.498 --> 04:40.354
Kowalski.

04:48.236 --> 04:50.221
Got a call on a 415/p.

04:50.301 --> 04:53.098
Disturbance. Penguins involved.

04:53.178 --> 04:55.454
Now how I'd know it'd be you, punks?

04:55.534 --> 04:56.822
- It's officer X.
- The deranged animal control supercop.

04:59.453 --> 05:02.380
You birds are long way from the zoo.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.568
That's awfully unsafe.

05:03.753 --> 05:05.395
Considering what time it is.

05:06.815 --> 05:07.874
7:30, maybe.

05:07.954 --> 05:09.586
Payback time.

05:10.506 --> 05:12.853
Ah, payback, that... That's make much more...

05:16.952 --> 05:19.149
Zoo is not good enough, huh?
Well, guess what?

05:19.229 --> 05:22.913
Out here you're stray animals,
and that makes you mine.

05:23.972 --> 05:24.528
Kaboom?

05:24.863 --> 05:26.275
Now more than ever.

05:29.539 --> 05:31.727
You think you can play me?
You're penguins.

05:31.807 --> 05:33.871
You don't even have brains enough to fly.

05:35.415 --> 05:37.604
No, but we sure know how to fall.

05:39.095 --> 05:39.783
No.

05:46.183 --> 05:48.204
Yes, I know what I said
about giving up your dolly.

05:50.939 --> 05:53.410
Okay, officer X was a nasty surprise.

05:56.578 --> 05:58.651
And yes, the fall was a bit rough on a bum.

05:59.842 --> 06:01.351
But we got away from him.

06:01.431 --> 06:02.957
I mean, that's a good thing, right?

06:03.037 --> 06:03.901
Not yet.

06:03.981 --> 06:05.225
You heard the man.

06:05.305 --> 06:08.807
As long as we outside the zoo,
we're considered stray animals

06:09.822 --> 06:11.375
I never felt so filthy.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.034
We're still seven blocks from home.

06:13.114 --> 06:15.001
But at least we've got
a solid head start on...

06:21.976 --> 06:23.723
Kowalski, analysis on that glow.

06:23.803 --> 06:27.041
It appears, officer X's van
has laser drilling capabilities.

06:27.121 --> 06:28.770
So, we should move then.

06:29.811 --> 06:31.011
Oh, most definitely

06:35.607 --> 06:37.522
Kowalski, give me an exit strategy.

06:37.602 --> 06:39.189
Up ahead, topside tunnel.

06:44.859 --> 06:46.844
We should be safe up here, Skipper.

06:46.924 --> 06:48.653
There's no way he'll fit through

06:54.954 --> 06:57.310
So wild, so free.

06:57.716 --> 06:59.551
Yet I know I could tame her.

07:00.804 --> 07:04.113
We'll never make it home with that
steel psycho mobil on our tails.

07:04.193 --> 07:06.502
Boys, we're taking that van out.

07:07.508 --> 07:08.681
No, you're right.

07:08.902 --> 07:10.119
The van must...

07:10.622 --> 07:11.442
Go.

07:12.731 --> 07:13.401
I need a minute.

07:13.481 --> 07:16.632
Giving up, huh?
That's what penguins are from Antarctica.

07:16.818 --> 07:17.921
Can't take the heat.

07:35.971 --> 07:37.260
Swing team, deploy.

08:01.287 --> 08:02.425
You see that, Rico?

08:02.505 --> 08:04.834
The way you dodged that lunatic.
The universe...

08:07.181 --> 08:08.496
You all right, amigo?

08:10.962 --> 08:12.347
Perhaps universe blinked.

08:12.427 --> 08:16.097
I loved that van.

08:16.177 --> 08:18.779
Yes, we all loved the van.

08:18.859 --> 08:20.368
You think you're the only one hurting?

08:20.448 --> 08:21.735
Let it go, Kowalski.

08:21.815 --> 08:23.368
Come on, we will lose him in the park.

08:27.435 --> 08:28.873
I'll never leave the zoo again.

08:28.953 --> 08:30.389
Except maybe for snowcones.

08:32.482 --> 08:33.803
Delinquent penguins.

08:33.883 --> 08:37.509
In the name of the metropolitan sub-bureau
of animal control and pretzel cart regulation

08:37.589 --> 08:39.274
you shall not pass.

08:39.354 --> 08:42.347
Kowalski, tell me you've got
a really sweet option.

08:42.427 --> 08:43.344
Frontal approach cut off.

08:43.424 --> 08:45.312
I suggest a brown river sneak around.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.353
Really?

08:46.733 --> 08:48.489
Interesting choice.

08:48.674 --> 08:49.962
On me. Go.

08:54.903 --> 08:56.050
Keep it moving, boys.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.264
That maniac can't be
too far behind us.

08:59.627 --> 09:01.048
Sweet dixie dreidels.

09:01.128 --> 09:02.817
How much are they paying this guy? 

09:02.976 --> 09:04.943
There's no escape in justice, punks.

09:05.023 --> 09:08.720
Like mother always said, whatever
you do, it always comes back around.

09:10.882 --> 09:12.358
Skipper, those pipes.

09:12.478 --> 09:14.202
I believe they're sewage feed lines.

09:14.322 --> 09:16.243
And they're pointed right at officer X.

09:16.363 --> 09:18.050
Well, that's a lucky break.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.994
You're right, Rico.
It is the universe.

09:23.114 --> 09:24.015
Go for it.

09:25.675 --> 09:27.531
Eat sewage, chump.

09:33.955 --> 09:35.271
Gotcha.

09:36.691 --> 09:37.748
X to the doghouse.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.235
Prepare a cage for four outlaw birdies.

09:40.355 --> 09:41.531
I... I don't believe it.

09:41.651 --> 09:44.211
Curse you, universe.

09:46.501 --> 09:48.369
Private, knock off the whistling.

09:48.489 --> 09:49.796
I'm trying to curse the universe.

09:49.916 --> 09:51.529
It's not me, Skipper. It's...

09:55.848 --> 09:57.618
Skipper, it's that sewer line.

09:57.738 --> 09:58.909
Something is blocking it.

09:59.029 --> 10:00.594
Oh, mama, it's gonna blow.

10:01.510 --> 10:02.893
Oh ma.

10:11.853 --> 10:14.128
That ain't gonna come out at the cleaners.

10:14.248 --> 10:17.062
Rico, that was it, your payback.
I knew it.

10:17.182 --> 10:19.779
The universe was just waiting for the right moment.

10:19.899 --> 10:23.234
Correction, Private.
It was waiting for the right girl.

10:24.613 --> 10:27.219
The lost dolly, it was blocking the pipe.

10:27.339 --> 10:31.301
Rico, I believe this pretty lady is now yours.

10:39.068 --> 10:41.379
The penguins, I tell you. The penguings...

10:41.499 --> 10:44.236
The crazed officer was arrested 

10:44.356 --> 10:47.826
for a vandalism spree over 
several city blocks last night.

10:47.946 --> 10:49.043
You see, Private.

10:49.163 --> 10:52.904
Once you let the universe know 
who is boss, things just work out.
