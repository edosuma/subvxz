00:04.010 --> 00:05.590
You ever seen anything
like this?

00:05.590 --> 00:06.590
Yeah, I have.

00:06.590 --> 00:07.800
Their injuries are internal.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.050
These people
were all exposed

00:09.050 --> 00:10.850
to some kind of
biological agent.

00:10.850 --> 00:12.140
And now so are we.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.720

00:20.430 --> 00:22.300
will be dead
within eight to ten hours.

You took a through-and-through

Let's, uh, comp them a
couple glasses of prosecco.

02:02.180 --> 02:03.510
Whatever... whatever's
nice in there.

02:03.510 --> 02:07.510
Okay.
Nice, big smile when you

Hey, Freddy, how we looking?

02:10.590 --> 02:12.590
Looking good.

That is fantastic.
I say a touch more garlic.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.140

Got it.

Ooh. I want to try

It's been here since yesterday.

Hey, I want you to
try something great.

What do you want me to try?
Don't worry about what it is.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.890
Just taste it.

02:56.550 --> 02:57.680
What do you think?

02:57.680 --> 02:59.100
Stop. What is this?

02:59.100 --> 03:00.680
Polenta crostini,
a little porcini.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.760
It's unbelievable.
Freddy, you do this?

03:02.760 --> 03:03.590
Of course I did.

Put it on the menu?
What do you think?

03:08.850 --> 03:12.180
Serve 'em, Danno.
Okay. Good job, Freddy.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.120
So that means that you're...
you're in

10:33.120 --> 10:35.990
a much better spot than we were.
'Cause you understand.

10:35.990 --> 10:37.790
You know, you know
that it takes work,

10:37.790 --> 10:38.540
and you know what happens

10:38.540 --> 10:40.620
if you... if you don't put
that work in.

10:40.620 --> 10:41.910
You gotta...
you gotta work at it.

10:41.910 --> 10:45.040
If you want, I'll go downstairs,
I'll tell everybody to beat it.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.040
But I think that that
would be a mistake

10:47.040 --> 10:49.950
because this is a very good
thing you guys got.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.080
He is a good kid.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.700
And you're you.

10:52.700 --> 10:53.040
The best.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.080
And I like him a lot,
except for the fact

10:55.080 --> 10:56.080
that he took you away from me,

10:56.080 --> 10:58.120
but other than that,
I think he's good.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.660
(chuckles, sighs)

11:01.990 --> 11:04.450
You really think
we're gonna be all right?

11:04.450 --> 11:05.700
I do.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.910
I really do, genuinely.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.160
I love you, Danno.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.620
Love you, too, monkey.
Come here.

11:13.620 --> 11:15.540
Come here.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.250
GROVER:You ain't the bride.

11:19.250 --> 11:19.950
Where is she?

11:19.950 --> 11:22.450
The waiters out there are
running out of cocktail wienies.

11:22.450 --> 11:24.160
She's got... Uh, humidity...

11:24.160 --> 11:25.580
Her hair's in knots.

11:25.580 --> 11:26.370
She's down in two minutes.

11:26.370 --> 11:28.660
Okay? I just talked to her.
She's fine.

11:28.660 --> 11:30.250
Humidity?
Yeah, humidity.

11:30.250 --> 11:35.250
Yeah. I guess that's another
word for "she got cold feet."

11:35.250 --> 11:38.450
Look, uh, she...
she maybe got a little scared.

11:38.450 --> 11:40.200
But she's fine now.
I spoke to her,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.450
and, uh, everything's
gonna be okay.

11:42.450 --> 11:44.990
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure, okay?

11:44.990 --> 11:46.620
Trust me.
'Cause they gotta do this, man.

11:46.620 --> 11:48.830
I know.
I mean, I don't want to make it

11:48.830 --> 11:50.410
all about money,
but hell, I'm retired.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.660
I'm on a fixed income, man.

11:52.660 --> 11:54.120
This wedding wasn't cheap.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.870
I know, I know. I paid for it.

11:56.870 --> 11:59.370
You didn't pay
for the rehearsal dinner.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.910
That was at my restaurant.

12:01.910 --> 12:02.990
The booze.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.000
The booze-- I had to pay
for the booze.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.370
And let's face it, the Williams

12:07.370 --> 12:09.540
are a family of drinkers.
Okay.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.160
Will you please relax?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.500
I just told you
everything's gonna be fine.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.370
Let's go outside.
Let's talk to people.

12:13.370 --> 12:15.990
Danny, hang on a second.

12:16.580 --> 12:18.790
When they first got together,
did you ever think

12:18.790 --> 12:21.040
we'd end up here, me and you?

12:21.040 --> 12:22.540
Uh, no.

12:22.540 --> 12:23.950
No chance.

12:23.950 --> 12:24.990
Neither did I.

12:24.990 --> 12:26.080
Not in a million years.

12:26.080 --> 12:30.500
But I tell you what, I'm...
I'm glad it happened.

12:30.700 --> 12:33.790
You really raised yourself
a fine young woman.

12:33.790 --> 12:35.620
Thank you. Thank you.

12:35.620 --> 12:39.910
You, uh... you did okay,
too, I guess.

12:39.910 --> 12:40.870
(chuckles)

12:40.870 --> 12:41.990
Go get my daughter.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.620
TANI: Guys?
STEVE: What?

12:44.620 --> 12:45.950
We got another problem.

12:45.950 --> 12:47.250
Junior, come here.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.990
Keep pressure right there.
Right. Got you.

12:48.990 --> 12:51.080
What's going on?
He rigged the door.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.290
Some kind of explosive.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.500
We open this door,
this is gonna blow.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.870
The son of a bitch locked us in.

13:02.580 --> 13:03.790
Who is that guy? Who is he?

13:03.790 --> 13:05.580
I don't know.
You're gonna be all right.

13:05.580 --> 13:07.410
Oh, good.
You're gonna be okay.

13:07.410 --> 13:09.370
We shoot our way out.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.700
Two bullets, both used.

13:18.290 --> 13:19.580
Plan B?

13:19.580 --> 13:21.330
Find a way to get
somebody up here.

13:21.330 --> 13:22.950
How am I supposed to do that?

13:22.950 --> 13:24.000
This is an isolated wing.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.250
That glass is two inches...

13:25.250 --> 13:26.700
Figure it out. Figure it out.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.370
Go figure it out.

13:28.790 --> 13:29.950
We're gonna roll you over,
Danny.

13:29.950 --> 13:30.910
I gotta see behind you,
all right?

13:30.910 --> 13:32.450
See if it's
a through-and-through.

13:32.450 --> 13:33.750
Okay, ready?

13:33.750 --> 13:34.830
One, two, three.
(groans)

13:34.830 --> 13:37.000
What do you got?
Okay, we got a
right-side exit wound.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.080
It is too far right for the
heart, too high for the liver.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.160
You hear that?
Okay, but here's the bad news.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.870
I think you punctured a lung.

13:43.870 --> 13:45.080
(banging)

13:45.580 --> 13:47.910
(grunting)

13:52.200 --> 13:53.990
I had to try.

13:54.990 --> 13:55.370
Good.

13:55.370 --> 13:56.620
We gotta get you up
on this table, Danny.

13:56.620 --> 13:59.370
Yeah. I can get up.
Okay, we're gonna
put you on a monitor.

13:59.370 --> 14:00.870
Keep you stable, all right?

14:00.870 --> 14:02.990
We load on three. Ready?
All right. Yeah.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.790
STEVE:
On three.

14:04.790 --> 14:07.540
One, two, three.

14:07.540 --> 14:10.990
(Danny groaning)

14:11.830 --> 14:13.540
I got you, buddy.

14:22.790 --> 14:24.790
STEVE:
I got you, buddy.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.990
Okay. Keep pressure.
Keep pressure.

14:32.540 --> 14:35.080
Junior, open up his shirt.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.410
All right, all right.

14:51.410 --> 14:55.200
You're all right, buddy.
You're okay.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.200
You're all right, buddy.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.040
STEVE:
All right.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.620
All right.

15:06.620 --> 15:09.990
(high-pitched whirring)

15:12.250 --> 15:14.700
(grunting)

15:28.370 --> 15:28.950
Okay.

15:28.950 --> 15:30.660
I flooded the bathroom,
so when the water seeps

15:30.660 --> 15:32.950
through the ceiling,
somebody's gonna come.

15:32.950 --> 15:33.990
How's he doing?

15:33.990 --> 15:36.120
If his vitals stay like this,
he's gonna be okay,

15:36.120 --> 15:38.750
but if his O2 or blood pressure
drops below 80...

15:38.750 --> 15:40.790
Hold on.
These numbers are going down.

15:40.790 --> 15:42.580
STEVE: What? What?
(Danny grunts)

15:42.580 --> 15:44.410
I take it back.
What?

15:44.410 --> 15:45.080
I just want to be bored.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
don't you worry.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.750
We're getting you
out of here soon.

15:47.750 --> 15:48.750
All right?
(rapid beeping)

15:48.750 --> 15:50.540
What-what's happening?
Hey, Steve.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.040
Huh?
His heart rate's spiking,
O2 dropping.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.790
STEVE:
His wound's sucking air.
That's what's going on.

15:54.790 --> 15:56.500
It's putting pressure
on his working lung.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.990
That's why he can't breathe.
We gotta make a seal.

15:58.990 --> 16:00.160
Trauma dressing.
And tape.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.450
Wait, wait. Hold on.
What's that gonna do?

16:01.450 --> 16:04.290
Theoretically, it's
gonna push the air out

16:04.290 --> 16:05.620
and stop it sucking air in.

16:05.620 --> 16:06.330
All right? Come on, buddy.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.580
I just want to call
Charlie and Grace and...
Listen.

16:08.580 --> 16:10.620
You're gonna see Grace
and Charlie really soon.

16:10.620 --> 16:11.540
You understand me?

16:11.540 --> 16:12.990
Come on, come on, come on.

16:12.990 --> 16:15.950
Understand?
Okay, good. Go, go.

16:16.330 --> 16:17.330
TANI:
Boss?

16:17.330 --> 16:18.990
You ever done this before?
No.

16:18.990 --> 16:21.990
Saw a medic do it
in the field once, though.

16:23.990 --> 16:26.700
(groaning)
Tape. Junior.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.000
There. Good.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.700
(Danny coughing)

16:30.700 --> 16:33.450
Come on, buddy.
One more.

16:34.950 --> 16:37.990
All right.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.200
TANI: Look, his
heart rate's going down.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.830
The O2's not changing, though.

16:44.830 --> 16:45.990
We need more oxygen.

16:45.990 --> 16:48.750
Hey, can we use that?

16:49.620 --> 16:50.620
STEVE:
Yes.

16:50.620 --> 16:54.410
Tani, grab that tank
and the respirator.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.990
That's good.

17:05.990 --> 17:07.870
We're good.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.950
Okay, it's coming up.

17:14.620 --> 17:15.660
Okay, you just
keep breathing,

17:15.660 --> 17:16.540
buddy, all right?
Keep breathing.

17:16.540 --> 17:19.410
I'm gonna go find something
for your pain.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.700
He's all right for now.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.790
This is a
temporary fix, okay?

17:26.790 --> 17:30.250
If that tank runs out
and we're still stuck in here,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.540
we're gonna lose Danny.

17:38.870 --> 17:41.120
♪ ♪

17:46.000 --> 17:47.830
How is it they don't...

17:47.830 --> 17:50.990
How do they not
have aspirin in here?

18:11.990 --> 18:12.910
Anything?

18:12.910 --> 18:14.990
No, nothing.
No phone, no wallet.

18:14.990 --> 18:16.330
This guy's got no I.D. on him.

18:16.330 --> 18:18.370
Just for a minute.
Just for a minute.

18:18.370 --> 18:20.000
Just for a minute.

Code blue.

18:34.990 --> 18:36.450
Call it in.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.830
Hey! Hey!

18:41.410 --> 18:42.990
Thank God.

18:42.990 --> 18:44.990
(muffled):
Hey, stop! Stop!

Back away from the door.

Back away! Back away.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.160
Stop. Stop.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.040
Junior,
put the mask back on.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.540
Put it back on.
Turn it on.

18:54.540 --> 18:56.450
Turn it on.
All right, buddy.

18:56.450 --> 18:57.580
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.790
Listen to me.
Can you hear me?

18:59.990 --> 19:01.540
There is a bomb on this door.

19:01.540 --> 19:02.700
Look at me.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.200
You open this door,
we're all dead.

19:05.200 --> 19:05.990
Do you understand?

19:05.990 --> 19:08.040
My partner, Detective
Danny Williams,

19:08.040 --> 19:10.950
has a gunshot wound
to the chest.

19:10.950 --> 19:11.370
We need an EMT,

19:11.370 --> 19:13.700
we need a cardio thoracic
trauma specialist,

19:13.700 --> 19:16.620
and we need the bomb squad
here right now.

19:16.620 --> 19:18.290
Go. Go, go.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.990
(sirens whooping)

19:21.750 --> 19:24.000
(helicopter buzzing above)

19:24.910 --> 19:26.830
GROVER: How's Danny?
DUKE: He's critical

19:26.830 --> 19:28.160
but stable.
We've got doctors on site

19:28.160 --> 19:30.200
talking McGarrett
through how to treat him.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.580
How soon can we
get in there?

19:32.580 --> 19:33.750
Bomb squad just got here.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.000
They're examining the bomb now.

19:35.000 --> 19:35.990
We should know soon.

19:35.990 --> 19:38.330
Still, we got no I.D.
on the gunman.

19:38.330 --> 19:40.370
Let's get all nonessential
personnel away

19:40.370 --> 19:42.830
from this building right now.
You got it.

19:42.830 --> 19:45.330
(frantic chatter)

19:54.870 --> 19:56.160
(grunts)

20:02.330 --> 20:04.120
STEVE: All right, Doc.
Okay, Commander,

20:04.120 --> 20:05.990
I'm going to want
you to push down

20:05.990 --> 20:06.950
on Detective Williams' chest

20:06.950 --> 20:09.330
just beneath the bullet
wound as he exhales.

20:09.330 --> 20:10.120
Right here?
Yeah.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.660
That will relieve
the air pressure

20:11.660 --> 20:13.160
that's been building up.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.450
I got it.

20:14.450 --> 20:15.040
Hey.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.990
You ready? I'm pretty
sure this is gonna hurt.

20:17.990 --> 20:19.120
(grunts weakly)

20:19.120 --> 20:20.990
You ready?

20:20.990 --> 20:23.200
(groaning)

20:25.540 --> 20:26.580
All right, you okay?

20:26.580 --> 20:28.330
Hey, hey, hey. You all right?

20:28.330 --> 20:30.160
He's all right.

20:30.540 --> 20:31.450
Commander McGarrett was right.

20:31.450 --> 20:33.540
The device appears
to be motion sensitive.

20:33.540 --> 20:35.700
A small vibration
could set it off.

20:35.700 --> 20:36.990
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

20:36.990 --> 20:39.990
So it was a great idea for me
to slam a chair

20:39.990 --> 20:40.870
against the glass window, then.

20:40.870 --> 20:42.990
Yeah, you probably shouldn't
have done that.

20:42.990 --> 20:45.120
Sorry. My first bomb.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.990
Look, I'll be right back.

20:46.990 --> 20:49.990
Okay. I'm not going anywhere.

20:50.580 --> 20:51.990
Captain.
All right, what do we know?

20:51.990 --> 20:54.750
For a homemade job, it
looks pretty sophisticated.

20:54.750 --> 20:55.370
We gotta get an X-ray,

20:55.370 --> 20:58.410
see what's going on inside
and take it from there.

20:58.410 --> 21:00.250
Okay.

21:03.370 --> 21:06.250
What do you say there, kid?
Are you okay?

21:06.250 --> 21:08.200
Yeah.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.990
All of you, hang in there.

21:12.990 --> 21:14.990
We're gonna get you out.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.540
Hurry.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.700
(device beeps)

21:23.700 --> 21:26.250
Just taking an X-ray.

21:28.700 --> 21:29.990
Yo, yo. J-Money.
Eric.

21:29.990 --> 21:31.290
You get something
for McGarrett for Christmas yet?

21:31.290 --> 21:34.000
'Cause I got the perfect gift:
a tac knife with his name

21:34.000 --> 21:35.410
engraved on the blade.
Pretty baller, right?

21:35.410 --> 21:37.450
Thing is, it's a little
out of my price range.

21:37.450 --> 21:41.120
I was thinking you and I
go halfsies. What do you say?

21:41.120 --> 21:41.790
What?

21:41.790 --> 21:44.040
Something's happened
at the hospital.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.250
Uncle D?

21:47.250 --> 21:49.910
Yeah.

21:49.990 --> 21:53.000
There's a good amount
of plastic explosive in here.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.200
Probably some home-cooked
potassium chlorate.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.830
Good news is
there's no timing mechanism.

21:57.830 --> 21:59.830
So it won't go off
till it's triggered.

21:59.830 --> 22:01.830
That's fine,
that's all well and good,

22:01.830 --> 22:02.910
but as you can see in here,

22:02.910 --> 22:05.700
we got ourselves
another ticking clock.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.950
We need to disarm
this thing-- and fast.

22:07.950 --> 22:10.990
You see these oval shapes
in the bottom left?

22:10.990 --> 22:12.700
Those are mercury switches.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.450
Very tough to defuse.

22:14.450 --> 22:16.080
Can't you walk them through it?

22:16.080 --> 22:16.990
It's very complicated.

22:16.990 --> 22:20.750
I don't think you understand
how risky it could be.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.790
Let me tell you about risky.
You see him?

22:22.790 --> 22:23.450
That's Steve McGarrett.

22:23.450 --> 22:25.410
You leave Steve
McGarrett in a room

22:25.410 --> 22:27.830
without a plan, and you know
what he's gonna do then?

22:27.830 --> 22:29.990
He's gonna come up
with one of his own.

22:29.990 --> 22:30.950
And it ain't gonna be risky.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.990
It's only gonna be the most
certifiably insane thing

22:33.990 --> 22:35.990
you or I could ever think of.

22:35.990 --> 22:38.370
So, for God's sake,
please tell me

22:38.370 --> 22:40.250
there's another option.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.250
We may have another way.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.870
(monitor beeping)

22:46.250 --> 22:46.910
Hey.

22:46.910 --> 22:50.290
(weakly): Never thought
I would see the day...

22:50.290 --> 22:51.790
What?

22:52.040 --> 22:53.450
It's a big day for Charlie, huh?

22:53.450 --> 22:55.620
What about Charlie?
What's-what's happening, huh?

22:55.620 --> 22:58.080
What's the big day?
What about Charlie?

22:58.080 --> 22:59.750
(muffled muttering)

22:59.750 --> 23:00.000
Doc.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.910
It's gotta be the blood loss.
He's getting confused.

23:02.910 --> 23:04.410
Just-just keep him talking.

23:04.410 --> 23:05.830
Tell me about Charlie, okay?

23:05.830 --> 23:07.910
What's going on today?

23:09.330 --> 23:10.620
Tell me about Charlie.

23:10.620 --> 23:12.370
DUKE:To wear the badge

23:12.370 --> 23:15.410
means to see the worst of life

23:15.410 --> 23:17.990
and come back to work
the next day.

23:17.990 --> 23:20.990
When you put on that badge,
you're making a pledge.

23:20.990 --> 23:25.370
A pledge to help people
day in and day out.

23:25.370 --> 23:27.910
To protect them
in times of danger.

23:27.910 --> 23:31.790
To support them
in times of sorrow.

23:31.790 --> 23:36.200
The path you've chosen,
it's not an easy one.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.660
But your loved ones,

23:37.660 --> 23:40.500
many who've worn
the badge themselves,

23:40.500 --> 23:42.410
will be there for you.

23:42.410 --> 23:43.700
Think he was looking at me.

23:43.700 --> 23:46.330
No, I'm pretty sure
he was looking at me.

23:46.330 --> 23:47.990
No. I'm his father.

23:47.990 --> 23:49.950
Yeah, I'm his
role model, Danny.

23:49.950 --> 23:50.200
Wow.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.160
You really... you really...
you really believe that, huh?

23:53.160 --> 23:54.450
Oh, I know it.
He told me.

23:54.450 --> 23:57.620
No, he didn't tell you that.
Mm-hmm.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.990
So, who did the
commencement address

23:59.990 --> 24:01.910
at your graduation?

24:02.160 --> 24:03.750
You busting my balls, Reigns?

24:03.750 --> 24:06.620
You know it's
what I live for.

24:06.620 --> 24:09.330
You're lucky you're cute.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.700
DUKE:
Remember,

24:13.700 --> 24:16.500
look out for one another.

24:17.870 --> 24:20.080
And be safe.

24:20.870 --> 24:23.910
Ho'omai'ka'i 'ana.

24:25.580 --> 24:27.990
(cheering and applause)

24:29.500 --> 24:32.290
(whooping)
STEVE: Yeah, Charlie!

24:32.870 --> 24:34.580
TANI:
Go, Charlie!

24:40.660 --> 24:43.370
All right, this is very nice,
very nice.

24:43.370 --> 24:44.620
Give him a little something.

24:44.620 --> 24:45.790
Come on, give him
a little something.

24:45.790 --> 24:48.160
There you go. Very nice.
(camera shutter snapping)

24:48.160 --> 24:49.580
One more.
Give him a little, uh...

24:49.580 --> 24:51.700
Smile a little bit, Charlie.
Come on, smile.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.700
Ah, that's nice.
Congratulations,
little Williams.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.040
Thanks, Uncle.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.620
In honor of your success,

24:57.620 --> 25:01.990
we'd like to host you and yours
at the Tupuola Waikiki tonight.

25:01.990 --> 25:03.120
For dinner.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.660
20% off all entrées on the menu.

25:05.660 --> 25:07.500
Excuse me. Can I ask
you guys a question?

25:07.500 --> 25:09.870
You're now the, uh... the
proud proprietors of not one

25:09.870 --> 25:11.750
but two luxury resorts.
Isn't that right?

25:11.750 --> 25:13.370
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, all right.
Why you still so cheap, huh?

25:13.370 --> 25:15.910
I think the answer to that
is in the question.
(phone ringing)

25:15.910 --> 25:18.950
What about the answer to why
you two are always dressed, uh,

25:18.950 --> 25:20.990
inappropriately for
social functions?

25:20.990 --> 25:22.990
KAMEKONA:
It's aloha casual.

25:22.990 --> 25:23.990
Rey.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.290
Yeah, we're coming.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.950
Hey. We gotta go.

25:27.950 --> 25:28.620
Work.
Oh.

25:28.620 --> 25:29.990
Congratulations.
No worries.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.080
Thanks for coming, guys.

25:31.080 --> 25:31.910
Are you kidding me, man?

25:31.910 --> 25:34.370
We wouldn't have missed it.
Come here.

25:34.370 --> 25:34.990
Listen.

25:34.990 --> 25:37.000
I know you want to do
some time at HPD--

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
and that's cool-- but
if you're interested,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.540
I'd really like
to bring you on to Five-O.

25:43.990 --> 25:45.200
Wow. Thanks, Captain Rey.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.790
Congrats. Come here.
(chuckles)

25:48.040 --> 25:49.990
Hey. You know
what we're missing?

25:49.990 --> 25:50.500
Your favorite uncle.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.750
Come here.
All right,
let's get one.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.080
Huh? How about this?

25:54.080 --> 25:56.250
Ah, look at that.
(camera clicks)

25:57.290 --> 25:58.990
(rapid beeping)

25:58.990 --> 26:00.290
Danny.

26:00.290 --> 26:00.990
Danny!

26:00.990 --> 26:03.990
Hey, hey, Doc,
he's crashing, Doc.

26:03.990 --> 26:05.120
Danny, Danny,
stay with me.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.990
Danny, keep breathing.
Danny, come on.

26:10.410 --> 26:11.490
STEVE: There's something
under his skin.

26:11.490 --> 26:13.160
There's, like,
these bumps under his skin.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.290
Yeah, those are air bubbles.

26:14.290 --> 26:15.370
That's a tension pneumothorax--

26:15.370 --> 26:17.910
possibly from
a bronchopleural fistula.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.490
What does that mean?

26:18.490 --> 26:19.870
That his chest
is filling up with air

26:19.870 --> 26:21.830
faster than it's escaping,
and now it's

26:21.830 --> 26:23.290
putting pressure on his heart.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.790
We need to alleviate
that pressure.

26:24.790 --> 26:28.910
How we gonna do that?
I'm gonna walk you through it.

26:30.490 --> 26:32.120
Hey, buddy.
Hey, Danny.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.750
Congratulations, huh?

26:33.750 --> 26:34.790
Mahalo, brutha. (chuckles)

26:34.790 --> 26:37.700
Oh, look at that beautiful
baby girl, man.
Yeah.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.660
You and Kono really know
how to make a human being.

26:40.660 --> 26:41.490
Thanks, man.

26:41.490 --> 26:43.490
God, you know,
sometimes it seems like

26:43.490 --> 26:44.540
I've spent half my life
in danger,

26:44.540 --> 26:47.250
but I've never been as scared
as I am right now.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.370
That's parenthood, buddy.
Welcome.

26:49.370 --> 26:50.490
(sighs)

26:50.490 --> 26:52.540
You're gonna do great.
I mean, you're, uh...

26:52.540 --> 26:54.040
you're great with my kid.

26:54.040 --> 26:54.620
You're a good uncle.

26:54.620 --> 26:57.040
You're gonna be a
great father, hmm?

26:57.040 --> 26:58.910
You learn how to swaddle yet?

26:58.910 --> 26:59.540
Swaddle?
Swaddle.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.620
That's where you take
the baby and you

27:01.620 --> 27:03.370
wrap it up like
a little, uh...

27:03.370 --> 27:04.620
little burrito.
A burrito?

27:04.620 --> 27:05.490
Yeah.
No. No, not yet.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.910
It's good. You gotta... you
gotta learn how to do that

27:07.910 --> 27:09.490
before you leave here.
It's very crucial.

27:09.490 --> 27:11.620
How about, uh, we go
in there and you show me?

27:11.620 --> 27:14.490
I would. Uh, I would,
but I'm dealing

27:14.490 --> 27:16.120
with something
right now, you know?

27:16.120 --> 27:17.490
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

27:17.490 --> 27:20.910
KELLER: Tani, I need you to go
find some antiseptic wipes

27:20.910 --> 27:21.620
and towels. Go.

27:21.620 --> 27:24.490
Junior, I need you to find
a disposable scalpel.

27:24.490 --> 27:26.490
Also look for a Kelly clamp.

27:26.490 --> 27:27.490
It's like a thin
pair of scissors

27:27.490 --> 27:29.330
with teeth.
GROVER:
What's happening in there?

27:29.330 --> 27:33.330
We need to cut open Detective
Williams' chest right away.

27:34.370 --> 27:35.490
STEVE:
Hey, Lou?

27:35.490 --> 27:36.290
I'm right here, buddy.

27:36.290 --> 27:37.830
Tell me you're getting us
out of here.

27:37.830 --> 27:38.950
All we need is a
couple minutes.

27:38.950 --> 27:43.120
We are going to get you
out of there.

27:43.410 --> 27:45.490
STEVE:
Come on, guys.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.490
Commander, I want you to take
Detective Williams' right arm

27:50.490 --> 27:53.490
and put it up over his head.

27:55.410 --> 27:58.120
Good. Now turn
his head to the left.

27:58.120 --> 28:02.410
You're gonna cut into
the right side of his chest.

28:07.370 --> 28:08.620
I just convinced
my friends

28:08.620 --> 28:13.120
that your ironclad plan
is going to save our boy's life.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.910
So...

28:14.910 --> 28:17.450
you do have a plan, right?

28:17.450 --> 28:19.450
We do. Follow me.

28:24.540 --> 28:26.700
We're gonna
blow that wall.

28:26.700 --> 28:27.490
What?

28:27.490 --> 28:28.490
BULLOCK:
Look, right now,

28:28.490 --> 28:29.790
our best shot at
getting them out

28:29.790 --> 28:32.870
is to take this wall down
with a controlled blast.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.790
Then we can get through
from this room.

28:34.790 --> 28:37.160
It's a shared wall.
We can plant

28:37.160 --> 28:37.750
explosive charges.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.790
Then we can detonate it
from this side.

28:39.790 --> 28:42.580
You're telling me
that the alternative

28:42.580 --> 28:45.370
to defusing
a motion-sensitive bomb

28:45.370 --> 28:48.830
is to blow another bomb
a few feet away?

28:48.830 --> 28:49.490
14 feet away.

28:49.490 --> 28:50.750
Are you related
to McGarrett or something?

28:50.750 --> 28:53.200
This is something
that he would come up with!

28:53.200 --> 28:54.120
A small,
controlled blast

28:54.120 --> 28:57.120
probably won't be
disruptive enough

28:57.120 --> 28:59.330
to trigger the device
on the door.

28:59.330 --> 29:00.370
"Probably"?

29:00.370 --> 29:02.950
We have safer plans,
but all of them

29:02.950 --> 29:05.580
will take an hour
or more to execute.

29:06.490 --> 29:09.080
I don't believe this.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.000
All right, let's do it.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.620
But get everybody out here
in a hazmat suit. Let's go.

29:20.620 --> 29:23.750
First, find the middle
of his collarbone.

29:23.910 --> 29:28.540
Then slide your finger down
until you feel his first rib.

29:28.540 --> 29:29.160
I got it.

29:29.160 --> 29:30.580
All right, good.
Now you're gonna make

29:30.580 --> 29:32.080
an incision about
two inches long

29:32.080 --> 29:35.000
between his fourth
and his fifth ribs.

29:35.000 --> 29:35.910
It's gonna be difficult.

29:35.910 --> 29:38.910
You're gonna have to cut
through flesh and tissue.

29:43.490 --> 29:44.290
STEVE:
Okay.

29:44.290 --> 29:47.330
Now slide your left
index finger

29:47.330 --> 29:51.580
into the incision
and feel for the fifth rib.

29:51.830 --> 29:55.490
Anything I owe you,
for you giving me your liver--

29:55.490 --> 29:57.370
we're even.

29:59.660 --> 30:00.540
I'm in.

30:00.540 --> 30:02.660
Junior, give him
the Kelly clamp.

30:03.290 --> 30:04.490
Okay, Commander.

30:04.490 --> 30:08.490
Place the tip carefully
into the incision,

30:08.490 --> 30:10.870
and then do
a little blunt dissection

30:10.870 --> 30:14.040
to get through the tissue
to the rib.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.200
Okay.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.580
Advance the tips
of the Kellys

30:17.580 --> 30:21.330
to just over the
top of the rib.

30:21.910 --> 30:23.500
Make sure you stay
close to the rib

30:23.500 --> 30:26.160
so you don't nick
any arteries.

30:30.040 --> 30:30.790
STEVE:
Okay.

30:30.790 --> 30:33.490
KELLER:
Now you're going to
carefully puncture

30:33.490 --> 30:34.830
his chest wall.

30:34.830 --> 30:37.450
That's going
to relieve the pressure.

30:37.450 --> 30:39.370
(rapid beeping)

30:39.370 --> 30:40.910
Push in.
Doc, we're losing him.

30:40.910 --> 30:42.490
Push in.

30:45.490 --> 30:46.700
I feel the air coming out.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.370
That's it.
Vitals are stabilizing.

30:50.080 --> 30:50.500
You did it.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.490
KELLER:
Okay, Commander, now...

30:52.490 --> 30:54.490
I want you to remove the clamp,

30:54.490 --> 30:56.250
put your finger
back in the incision

30:56.250 --> 30:57.490
and sweep it from
side to side

30:57.490 --> 31:00.490
to make sure nothing is
blocking the opening.

31:00.490 --> 31:02.330
Junior,
get ready to cover

31:02.330 --> 31:04.410
with the gauze and the tape.

31:05.490 --> 31:09.160
Now, Commander,
remove your finger.

31:09.830 --> 31:11.200
Good.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.660
That's right.

31:15.290 --> 31:15.950
Okay, he's stable,

31:15.950 --> 31:18.490
but we need to get him
into the O.R. now,

31:18.490 --> 31:20.450
or we are gonna lose him.

31:20.620 --> 31:23.410
Get your hazmat suit on, Doc.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.000
Steve.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.580
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you something,

31:31.580 --> 31:32.870
and we ain't gonna
debate about it.

31:32.870 --> 31:35.040
Just do what I say.
The three of you move Danny,

31:35.040 --> 31:38.200
and I want you to go
to the other side of this room.

31:38.200 --> 31:38.750
What's going on?

31:38.750 --> 31:41.160
That wall over there's
coming down.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.620
Go, go, go.

31:51.290 --> 31:52.290
Go ahead.

31:52.290 --> 31:53.370
Go ahead, go ahead.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.830
Move that middle bed.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.410
Need to get him
against the wall, all right?

31:57.410 --> 31:58.660
Go, go, go.

31:59.790 --> 32:01.660
Okay, move him on back.

32:01.660 --> 32:03.330
Go.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.490
(beeping)

32:11.490 --> 32:14.120
You got him? You got him?
Yeah.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.790
Go.

32:18.490 --> 32:20.700
Junior,
grab that mattress.

32:26.910 --> 32:27.790
Keep your heads down.

32:27.790 --> 32:29.200
Cover your ears, all right?

32:29.200 --> 32:30.490
Cover your ears.

32:37.910 --> 32:39.490
On my command.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.250
Three.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.490
Two.

32:42.490 --> 32:44.490
One. Go.

32:44.490 --> 32:46.700
(explosion)

32:49.750 --> 32:52.200
You guys all right?
JUNIOR: Yeah.

32:52.950 --> 32:54.830
They can't get through there.

32:54.830 --> 32:55.950
Damn it!

32:55.950 --> 32:59.200
Uh, he's still breathing.

33:00.490 --> 33:02.490
It's still up.

33:02.490 --> 33:04.950
Now what?
We need another charge.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.490
How long is that gonna take?

33:06.490 --> 33:07.580
Ten, 15 minutes.

33:07.580 --> 33:08.330
We...!

33:08.330 --> 33:10.660
I'm done listening to you.

33:10.870 --> 33:15.540
Chief, I need to borrow
something of yours.

33:16.700 --> 33:17.660
Bullock?

33:17.660 --> 33:19.040
What's going on?

33:19.040 --> 33:20.910
Stay where you are.

33:28.250 --> 33:30.120
(grunting)

33:33.500 --> 33:35.620
(frantic chatter)

33:35.620 --> 33:37.790
Move, move!

33:38.040 --> 33:39.580
Hey, come on!

33:40.910 --> 33:43.250
KELLER:
He's got a tension pneumo.

33:43.250 --> 33:44.000
Pulse is thready.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.500
Let's move. Let's move.

33:51.910 --> 33:54.910
Okay, let's get a chest tube
ready in the O.R.

33:54.910 --> 33:56.540
And hang two units right away.

33:56.540 --> 33:59.120
Let's go, go, go, go.

33:59.290 --> 34:03.790
All right, buddy.
All right, hang in there.

34:04.290 --> 34:05.870
I'm sorry, Commander.

34:05.870 --> 34:07.000
I cannot let you
go with him.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.290
The three of you
still need to be tested

34:09.290 --> 34:11.620
for traces of the virus.

34:39.990 --> 34:41.290
I know, Ma.

34:41.290 --> 34:43.160
But he's strong.

34:43.990 --> 34:46.250
Of course I will.
Of course.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.910
Soon as we hear anything.

34:49.410 --> 34:51.160
Love you, too.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.990
Hey.
Hey.

34:56.580 --> 34:59.120
I was just calling my ma again.

34:59.120 --> 34:59.790
I called Rachel.

34:59.790 --> 35:01.410
She's on the mainland
with the kids, and...

35:01.410 --> 35:04.000
they're gonna catch
the first flight out here.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.160
How are you doing?

35:07.870 --> 35:10.990
I hadn't called my ma
in three weeks,

35:10.990 --> 35:13.000
and then when I finally do,

35:13.000 --> 35:16.500
it's to tell her about all this.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.450
You know, when he
first moved here,

35:19.450 --> 35:22.000
Uncle D used to call us
back in Jersey like...

35:22.000 --> 35:23.700
two or three times a week.

35:23.700 --> 35:24.910
I thought maybe he was homesick,

35:24.910 --> 35:29.990
but I think he was just
calling to check in on us.

35:29.990 --> 35:31.950
You know, he was worried
the whole family

35:31.950 --> 35:34.200
would fall apart without him.

35:34.580 --> 35:37.290
I guess we kind of
did a little.

35:37.290 --> 35:38.830
Nobody more than me,
though, man,

35:38.830 --> 35:42.990
'cause I was just some
dumb kid back in Jersey,

35:42.990 --> 35:45.700
making dumb choices, and...

35:45.700 --> 35:47.540
Uncle D was the one
who set me straight.

35:47.540 --> 35:49.450
You know, man,
he's the one that...

35:49.450 --> 35:53.290
brought me up here and talked
some sense into me and...

35:53.290 --> 35:55.660
got me my job.

35:56.830 --> 35:59.120
I don't know what I'd do
without him.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.200
He...

36:00.200 --> 36:02.080
kind of saved
my life, you know?

36:02.080 --> 36:05.910
I just... I never
had a chance to thank him

36:05.910 --> 36:08.910
for everything he did for me.

36:10.950 --> 36:12.000
He's gotta pull through,
though, man.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.990
He's got to, you know?
Hey, hey.

36:13.990 --> 36:16.000
He will, okay?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.580
Danny's a fighter.

36:18.580 --> 36:20.990
Try not to worry so much.

36:22.910 --> 36:23.990
Hey.

36:23.990 --> 36:26.330
Hi.
GROVER: How you guys doing?
Everything check out?

36:26.330 --> 36:28.990
Yeah, we're all right.
No sign of the virus.

36:28.990 --> 36:30.250
Any news?
KAMEKONA: No.

36:30.250 --> 36:31.580
They don't tell us nothing
in here.

36:31.580 --> 36:34.580
They're still working on him.
That's all we know.

36:34.580 --> 36:36.500
Hey, kid.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.040
Hey.

36:37.040 --> 36:40.830
STEVE:
You're all right.
You're all right.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.500
You hanging in there?

36:42.500 --> 36:43.950
(sighs)
You all right?

36:43.950 --> 36:45.750
Yeah, I'm hanging in there.

36:45.750 --> 36:46.450
Listen to me.

36:46.450 --> 36:48.990
Your uncle's a tough guy.
You understand?

36:48.990 --> 36:50.870
He's gonna be all right.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.830
All right,
keep your head up.

36:52.830 --> 36:55.580
Lou, can I talk to you
for a second?
Yeah.

36:59.160 --> 36:59.700
Hey.

36:59.700 --> 37:01.080
We get anything on the gunman?

37:01.080 --> 37:04.040
Ran his prints through CODIS,
and... nothing.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.990
Nothing? What about the gun?

37:05.990 --> 37:07.990
Same thing. Dead end.

37:07.990 --> 37:09.700
This doesn't make any sense.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.870
Look, all due respect
to the job,

37:11.870 --> 37:12.990
to hell with this guy.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.540
He blew his brains out.
Good riddance.

37:14.540 --> 37:17.580
We got other things
to worry about right now.

37:17.580 --> 37:19.250
Yeah.

37:19.990 --> 37:21.000
(rapid beeping)

37:21.000 --> 37:23.160
(prolonged beep)
Traumatic arrest.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.700
Starting chest
compression.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.620
Hang another unit.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.000
Oh, hey.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.990
Clara called for you.

37:42.990 --> 37:45.330
Yesterday.
(snoring)

37:45.330 --> 37:46.990
I forgot to tell you.

37:46.990 --> 37:48.990
What's she doing anyway?

37:48.990 --> 37:49.990
Hey!

37:49.990 --> 37:51.330
Wake up. Hey.

37:51.330 --> 37:51.990
No.
Wake up.

37:51.990 --> 37:53.290
I'm talking to you.
What happened?

37:53.290 --> 37:55.040
Hey, I said there was
a phone call for you yesterday.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.000
I heard what you said.
Yesterday?
Clara was on the phone.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.540
You're telling me about
a phone call yesterday today?

37:58.540 --> 38:00.040
Clara-- has she made
a decision yet?
What's the matter with you?

38:00.040 --> 38:01.910
Yeah, she's gonna go
to the academy in the fall.

38:01.910 --> 38:03.990
I told you.
She's going to go
to the academy?

38:03.990 --> 38:05.080
What did I just say?
Wow.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.990
You're getting senile.
You know that?

38:06.990 --> 38:09.500
That is something.
That is really something.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.910
Can you believe
there's gonna be three...

38:11.910 --> 38:14.330
generations of cops
in your family, Danny?

38:14.330 --> 38:15.990
Well, I'll tell you
the truth--

38:15.990 --> 38:17.700
I wish she would have
done something else.

38:17.700 --> 38:20.200
Why? Why? It's in the blood.
"Why?"

38:20.200 --> 38:23.000
She came to me, uh,
before she made a decision.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.990
She came to you?

38:25.330 --> 38:26.080
Yeah, she came to me.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.990
Okay.
Who's she gonna come to? You?

38:27.990 --> 38:29.750
Come on.
Anyway, she came to me.

38:29.750 --> 38:33.200
She wanted to know what
I thought about my life.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.370
Like, if I could, you know,
change anything,

38:35.370 --> 38:36.580
would I change anything?

38:36.580 --> 38:38.040
Would I do anything differently?

38:38.040 --> 38:39.410
What'd you tell her?

38:39.410 --> 38:40.370
Well, I'll get to that

38:40.370 --> 38:42.250
if you shut up
for three seconds.

38:42.250 --> 38:43.790
I told her that I...

38:43.790 --> 38:45.700
I-I wouldn't change anything.

38:45.700 --> 38:48.750
I told her that I... I wanted
to lie, but I couldn't lie,

38:48.750 --> 38:50.410
any I told her that I
wouldn't... I wouldn't do it.

38:50.410 --> 38:52.990
If I had to do it all over
again, I'd do it the same way.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.750
That's the truth. Huh?
That's the truth.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.450
I-I mean, I would've
changed my partner,

38:56.450 --> 38:58.790
I-I would've told her.
Yeah, yeah.

38:58.790 --> 39:01.200
I love you, too, buddy.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.790
Hey, can you do me a favor?
Sure.

39:03.790 --> 39:05.830
Blow it out your ass.

39:05.830 --> 39:07.870
Okay.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.950
(prolonged beep)

39:12.950 --> 39:15.160
Come on.

39:23.790 --> 39:27.000
Are we ever going to talk
about this eyesore of a haircut?

39:27.180 --> 39:28.090
FLIPPA: Thank you.
I was waiting

39:28.190 --> 39:29.100
for someone
to bring that up.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.900
Yeah, Steve, was that,
like, a dare or something?

39:31.900 --> 39:35.480
No, it was my idea.
KAMEKONA:
Not a very good one,

39:35.480 --> 39:36.020
if you ask me.

39:36.020 --> 39:38.040
Huh. Well, I didn't ask,
but thanks for the input.

39:38.640 --> 39:42.760
I'm just saying,
some guys can rock the dome.

39:43.850 --> 39:45.590
The Rock, for example.

39:45.590 --> 39:46.640
Kelly Slater.

39:46.640 --> 39:49.590
KAMEKONA:
My man Kelly Slater.

39:49.590 --> 39:51.680
Yours truly.

39:52.510 --> 39:54.350
OG Chicago there.

39:54.970 --> 39:56.640
Me.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.140
KAMEKONA:
Look, you don't have

39:58.140 --> 39:59.590
the head shape to pull this off.

39:59.590 --> 40:01.260
Grow 'em out if
I was you, brah.

40:01.260 --> 40:03.760
Don't listen to 'em, boss.
It's a good look.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.180
Thanks, Jerry.

40:05.180 --> 40:06.680
Hey, Doc.

40:11.760 --> 40:14.850
It was, uh, touch and go
for a while,

40:14.850 --> 40:15.890
but, um...

40:15.890 --> 40:17.470
he pulled through.

40:17.470 --> 40:18.180
Yes!

40:18.180 --> 40:19.970
He's gonna be okay.

40:20.550 --> 40:21.220
Can we see him?

40:21.220 --> 40:22.470
He's not conscious
yet, but as soon

40:22.470 --> 40:23.970
as he is, we'll
get you in there.

40:23.970 --> 40:26.140
Thanks, Doc.
Thank you.

40:28.890 --> 40:30.590
(whooping)

40:33.180 --> 40:35.510
Danny, Danny, Danny.

40:35.510 --> 40:37.590
(whooping)

40:46.890 --> 40:48.590
What did he do? He did what?

40:48.590 --> 40:51.300
I think it's called
a finger thora...

40:52.010 --> 40:53.260
Costomy.
Yeah.

40:53.260 --> 40:54.850
Cracked your chest open,
wiggled my finger

40:54.850 --> 40:56.140
around inside there and, uh,

40:56.140 --> 40:57.600
stopped your heart from
getting crushed, but...

40:57.600 --> 41:00.590
you know, no big deal.
ADAM: Yeah, I'm sure
it was nothing.

41:00.590 --> 41:02.590
GROVER: No, brother,
it was disgusting.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.050
(laughter)

41:04.050 --> 41:05.600
Did he wash his hands at least?

41:05.600 --> 41:07.970
You know, time was really
of the essence.

41:07.970 --> 41:09.850
He didn't wash his hands.
STEVE: You're such a baby.

41:09.850 --> 41:12.590
You gonna be a baby about this?
Here, let me tell you something.
Baby?

41:12.590 --> 41:14.600
The fact is, if I didn't
put my finger inside of you,

41:14.600 --> 41:16.510
we wouldn't be having
this conversation right now.

41:16.510 --> 41:17.590
You know?
(cell phone ringing)

41:17.590 --> 41:19.970
Wow. Thanks for that image.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.890
Hey, Jerry, go ahead.
JERRY: Okay.

41:23.890 --> 41:24.970
So I ran the names of everyone

41:24.970 --> 41:27.180
who signed in
on the visitor log yesterday.

41:27.180 --> 41:28.470
Looks like our gunman signed in

41:28.470 --> 41:30.050
under the name
of "Joshua Hollister."

41:30.050 --> 41:31.930
But I run the name
through several databases,

41:31.930 --> 41:35.470
and as far as I can tell,
Joshua Hollister does not exist.

41:35.470 --> 41:37.590
So it was an alias.
Yes.

41:37.590 --> 41:38.590
But someone with that same name

41:38.590 --> 41:41.590
checked into a motel room
two days ago.

41:41.590 --> 41:43.140
Where?

41:50.140 --> 41:51.890
Clear!

41:52.720 --> 41:54.470
Commander.
