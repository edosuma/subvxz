00:02.339 --> 00:06.798
Our belief in reality is so strong
that our greatest fear is death.

00:07.188 --> 00:10.309
Precisely that fear
makes us vulnerable.

00:48.376 --> 00:49.711
What's going on here?

00:49.801 --> 00:51.786
I came into the ward
to wake him up.

00:51.876 --> 00:54.376
Prepare two grams of chloral hydrate.

00:54.710 --> 00:56.411
After the medicine works,

00:56.501 --> 00:59.620
lock up the patient and
don't let anybody in.

00:59.710 --> 01:03.293
Tomorrow he will be
taken in for leucotomy...

01:20.782 --> 01:22.995
Where is the patient?
How could he disappear?

01:23.085 --> 01:24.461
Only I had the key!

01:24.551 --> 01:26.568
Then somebody has a duplicate!

01:26.976 --> 01:28.986
Come to my office
tomorrow morning.

01:29.076 --> 01:30.445
Forgive me! Please!

01:30.535 --> 01:32.610
This has to stay a secret.

03:02.276 --> 03:03.510
Where am I?

05:41.101 --> 05:44.451
Do you think I'll know it?

05:46.085 --> 05:49.210
Yes, it used to be yours.

05:50.085 --> 05:54.460
All this time I wasted
trying to catch up with you?

06:19.293 --> 06:23.668
You'll thank me
afterwards... Close your eyes.

06:32.310 --> 06:35.101
I feel uncomfortable
not seeing anything...

06:35.210 --> 06:38.060
That's why I'm going to
open my eyes in 5 seconds!

06:38.168 --> 06:40.218
Now in four...

06:40.585 --> 06:42.251
three,

06:42.543 --> 06:44.501
two,

06:44.668 --> 06:46.918
one.

06:51.293 --> 06:54.960
I hope the forest will
give my sister back to me!

06:59.543 --> 07:02.460
It's not speaking to me...

07:02.668 --> 07:06.126
That's it, I'm leaving...

07:12.418 --> 07:15.126
Do you remember Fairy?

07:15.293 --> 07:17.078
Of course I do.

07:17.168 --> 07:19.085
She has grown a lot!

07:19.293 --> 07:23.203
You loved her too much,
that's why she run away.

07:23.293 --> 07:25.543
Maybe it's true...

07:26.085 --> 07:30.960
She is living here now...
But we can always visit her.

07:40.401 --> 07:43.086
It's nice that we were
allowed to leave earlier,

07:43.176 --> 07:44.486
but why actually?

07:44.576 --> 07:47.370
I can only guess: Several
guys were absent today

07:47.460 --> 07:50.243
then the teacher told
us not to drink the water.

07:50.801 --> 07:53.318
But we never did it anyway.

07:54.226 --> 07:56.926
Yeah, the water has a weird smell.

07:58.376 --> 08:01.861
Have you heard that Demian and his
family are leaving the town?

08:01.951 --> 08:02.745
No.

08:02.835 --> 08:06.156
He invites everyone to his place today
and asked me to tell you.

08:06.643 --> 08:08.695
I have to stay at home.

08:08.785 --> 08:11.251
It's the second time
you're not joining us.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.876
Mother isn't feeling well.

08:15.085 --> 08:16.503
See you tomorrow.

08:16.593 --> 08:17.493
Bye.

08:25.060 --> 08:28.170
For several days
mother hasn't gone out,

08:28.860 --> 08:30.670
and she refusing to eat.

08:31.460 --> 08:34.035
Mirra has stopped talking to me

08:34.326 --> 08:38.426
and I don't know how to explain to her
why this is happening to mother.

08:38.743 --> 08:40.909
The worst part of it

08:41.000 --> 08:45.028
is that I have accepted
we will be left alone.

08:45.218 --> 08:47.211
But she is still alive

08:47.301 --> 08:50.485
and we need to pray
for her recovery..."

09:07.226 --> 09:11.243
Please promise to take care
of my girls.

09:27.376 --> 09:29.668
As long as they stay here

09:29.835 --> 09:32.118
I will take care of them,

09:32.885 --> 09:35.868
but please turn to God, Anna,

09:36.160 --> 09:38.726
and I will pray for you.

09:43.910 --> 09:46.668
You need to sleep, take a rest.

09:57.710 --> 09:59.368
How is mother?

10:00.060 --> 10:02.618
Sorry your mother isn't getting better,

10:02.785 --> 10:05.076
but I'll keep praying for her.

10:05.535 --> 10:07.993
Thanks for coming.

10:23.268 --> 10:25.703
Nobody wants to help her!

10:25.893 --> 10:28.461
Even the doctor can't do anything!

10:28.551 --> 10:31.903
Maybe God wants to take her,

10:31.993 --> 10:34.051
be prepared for that.

10:37.826 --> 10:40.285
God doesn't care!

10:46.626 --> 10:49.551
-My home is always open to you.
-Thank you.

10:57.476 --> 10:59.761
His belief won't save mother.

10:59.851 --> 11:01.285
Stop it,

11:02.401 --> 11:03.985
he believes it

11:05.085 --> 11:07.201
and we should believe, too.

14:23.176 --> 14:24.426
Mother!

14:40.768 --> 14:43.501
Now we're left completely alone...

14:43.668 --> 14:45.401
It scares me.

14:48.768 --> 14:52.553
After we've said goodbye to mother,
we should leave our home.

14:52.643 --> 14:53.976
So soon?

14:55.293 --> 14:57.578
There's no reason to stay.

14:57.868 --> 15:00.061
You always dreamed of traveling.

15:00.151 --> 15:02.576
How can you bring this up now?

15:06.110 --> 15:08.861
Mirra, we can't stay here.

15:08.951 --> 15:12.335
You see it yourself,
everybody is getting sick.

15:28.951 --> 15:33.160
"I'll do my best to
leave this dark place tomorrow.

15:34.626 --> 15:38.386
I never thought I would think
this way about my home,

15:39.076 --> 15:43.493
but it has become so
deserted without mother.

15:44.493 --> 15:46.803
Mirra doesn't want to leave,

15:46.893 --> 15:49.820
she believes we have
to stay in the town

15:50.010 --> 15:51.835
and help the sick people.

15:53.443 --> 15:57.143
Mother would have done
everything to protect us.

15:57.860 --> 16:00.318
I'll say that to Mirra tomorrow,

16:01.085 --> 16:03.218
I hope she'll understand."

16:13.185 --> 16:16.745
Today's service will
start with the message

16:16.835 --> 16:20.485
to the Galatians about
the freedom of the spirit.

16:22.018 --> 16:24.220
It says that we shall

16:24.310 --> 16:28.501
not become hostages of the recent events

16:28.668 --> 16:31.001
but quite the opposite:

16:31.843 --> 16:33.454
With freedom and love,

16:33.544 --> 16:36.251
we shall overcome
all our losses...

16:37.376 --> 16:40.888
-Mirra, listen to the Father.
-Thus, we will start...

16:41.278 --> 16:43.491
with the fifth chapter:

16:44.293 --> 16:48.678
"You are summoned to freedom Brethren,
use it not for satisfying the meat,

16:49.268 --> 16:51.585
but serve each other with love.

16:59.618 --> 17:02.918
God didn't create death

17:03.810 --> 17:08.417
and he isn't joyful about
the demise of the living.

17:09.050 --> 17:11.609
Every being He created

17:13.117 --> 17:15.050
is subject to salvation.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.453
So, our soul never dies...

17:17.542 --> 17:19.984
Father, they need you
at the hospital!

17:20.151 --> 17:22.300
I'll explain it to you later.

17:37.618 --> 17:38.760
Let's go.

17:44.751 --> 17:46.085
Are you ok?

17:48.210 --> 17:49.843
I need to sleep.

17:56.126 --> 17:58.745
"Why is this happening to us?

17:58.835 --> 18:01.835
Mirra is getting worse and again,

18:02.001 --> 18:04.918
nobody can tell me how to save her.

18:05.026 --> 18:08.111
Dear God,
I know you can hear me now.

18:08.201 --> 18:10.710
Please, protect my sister.

18:28.460 --> 18:32.045
The last days she slept a lot
and refused to eat.

18:33.035 --> 18:35.051
She must be hospitalised.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.295
No way.

18:37.585 --> 18:40.270
She stays in bed and
you take care of her.

18:41.060 --> 18:43.651
The hospital is overcrowded anyway.

18:45.585 --> 18:49.626
You want to take the risk...
What if it's not an infection?

18:51.035 --> 18:52.518
She needs help.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.401
Please stay here with me.

19:04.918 --> 19:06.918
I'll show you to the door.

22:13.660 --> 22:14.893
Ayia!

22:18.101 --> 22:19.351
Ayia!

22:20.026 --> 22:21.318
I'm here.

22:21.501 --> 22:25.960
Bring Father Herman,
I want to ask him something.

22:26.126 --> 22:28.068
Ok, don't get up.

22:37.801 --> 22:40.220
Did she say why she
wanted to see me?

22:40.310 --> 22:42.520
No, but she's getting worse.

22:43.210 --> 22:45.951
-What did the doctor say?
-Nothing new...

23:12.018 --> 23:15.720
"Finally Mirra started
listening to Father Herman.

23:16.210 --> 23:19.618
For the first time she
wanted to speak to him.

23:20.085 --> 23:23.610
But I feel
she's growing apart from me,

23:25.418 --> 23:27.961
she seems to do
it on purpose.

23:29.251 --> 23:31.635
That hurts me even more..."

24:09.385 --> 24:10.585
How is she?

24:11.135 --> 24:14.193
She's very scared.
You'd better go in to her.

24:25.385 --> 24:27.210
What happened?

24:28.776 --> 24:31.911
I want everything to be
as it used to be!

24:32.001 --> 24:34.335
Mirra, you have high fever!

24:57.235 --> 24:58.918
Hello, Ayia.

25:00.785 --> 25:03.693
You should have got a
message in the morning.

25:06.310 --> 25:08.720
-Yeah, the letter...
-Then you know

25:08.810 --> 25:11.228
you should have left the house?

25:12.718 --> 25:15.651
Ayia, you must go to the hospital.

25:16.118 --> 25:18.301
But Mirra needs my help.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.320
This is an order,

25:20.410 --> 25:23.820
infected and the healthy people
need to be separated.

25:24.110 --> 25:26.303
The sick have to stay at home.

25:26.393 --> 25:28.586
I want to stay, I'm not afraid!

25:28.676 --> 25:32.201
Listen to me.
You can't help her anymore!

25:33.993 --> 25:36.585
I'll take you to the hospital now.

25:45.493 --> 25:46.601
Ayia!

26:26.101 --> 26:29.335
Of course it's wrong
to separate you.

26:29.901 --> 26:32.793
You promised mother
to take care of us.

26:35.651 --> 26:38.245
Yes, but now
I don't know how to help.

26:38.835 --> 26:41.460
The rules say
you must avoid infection.

26:46.376 --> 26:48.878
Father, please don't lock the door.

26:48.968 --> 26:50.751
I'll be back soon.

27:42.126 --> 27:44.286
Where have you been?

27:44.676 --> 27:47.026
I'll take you to Father Herman's.

27:56.018 --> 27:57.751
It's safer there...

27:59.368 --> 28:01.261
Nobody will find us!

28:30.585 --> 28:31.793
I'll help you.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.286
We need to cross the
abandoned part of the town,

28:35.376 --> 28:37.460
you'll feel better soon...

29:17.398 --> 29:20.253
"We'll leave as soon
as Mirra is better.

29:20.343 --> 29:22.870
Tomorrow I'll write
to our Aunt Anna,

29:22.960 --> 29:25.426
she has always had a room for us."

30:03.226 --> 30:05.628
I need to get some medicine.

30:05.718 --> 30:09.626
If necessary,
I'll go to the next village,

30:10.093 --> 30:11.710
I have money.

30:12.226 --> 30:14.176
Money will not help us.

30:14.943 --> 30:17.536
How long has she been like that?

30:17.626 --> 30:18.893
Five days.

30:23.126 --> 30:24.660
Stay here with her.

30:24.826 --> 30:27.210
God will soon tell us what to do...

30:59.324 --> 31:01.845
Please read a book to me.

31:02.035 --> 31:04.726
But there are only
religious books here.

31:04.993 --> 31:09.768
Latin Grammar, Ecclesiastica
Historia, Old Testament...

31:10.985 --> 31:12.251
What's this?

31:15.268 --> 31:17.526
This book looks really strange.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.710
What did you find?

31:38.160 --> 31:40.835
"From the shamans point of view,

31:41.001 --> 31:42.953
in a body full of vitality

31:43.043 --> 31:45.710
is no place for that
destructive energy

31:45.818 --> 31:49.260
that we tend to call illness."

33:10.710 --> 33:12.745
"Dear God,

33:13.335 --> 33:16.126
you see what state I'm in now.

33:16.935 --> 33:19.626
I'm full of doubt.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.853
I have to keep my secret

33:21.943 --> 33:25.120
so that the uninformed
don't hurt themselves

33:25.210 --> 33:27.251
and the others.

33:27.918 --> 33:31.543
But at the same time
I want to help Ayia...

33:31.710 --> 33:34.220
Maria has always been
a mother to me

33:34.310 --> 33:38.668
and the girls have been
like my own sisters.

33:39.335 --> 33:42.251
I can't make the right decision

33:42.460 --> 33:46.176
and I am asking for
your help my God!"

36:09.197 --> 36:11.243
You're not Mirra!

36:13.660 --> 36:15.551
Don't save me...

36:18.160 --> 36:20.818
Save the others!

37:18.918 --> 37:22.603
"I know I shouldn't have taken
the book without permission

37:22.693 --> 37:25.126
but it is like a sign of fate.

37:25.593 --> 37:28.603
It says that any disease can be cured

37:28.693 --> 37:31.951
which means Mirra can be helped too!"

37:33.243 --> 37:35.636
...but she has already
become worse.

37:35.726 --> 37:37.528
Please come and visit me.

37:37.618 --> 37:38.828
Yes, I can...

37:38.918 --> 37:41.451
Can I read this book,
Father Herman?

37:45.176 --> 37:47.710
Yes you can, but not here.

37:48.176 --> 37:49.726
I'll come to you later.

37:50.418 --> 37:51.576
Let's go...

37:52.493 --> 37:54.576
I found this book accidentally.

37:54.868 --> 37:56.993
This can help my sister, right?

37:57.101 --> 37:59.036
I understand what it's about.

37:59.126 --> 38:00.885
We'll talk at my home.

38:01.135 --> 38:03.286
Please, I'm begging you!

38:03.476 --> 38:06.310
I'll tell you everything,
just not here.

38:39.118 --> 38:40.918
I guess you realized that

38:41.285 --> 38:44.168
the book differs from
the Church moral...

38:44.835 --> 38:46.768
But you should also know

38:47.818 --> 38:49.485
it is about God, too.

38:50.585 --> 38:53.118
Nobody will find out, I promise.

38:54.360 --> 38:59.020
There is a ritual that opens a door
to the subconscious in each of us.

38:59.610 --> 39:03.610
Behind that door is an other world
that is linked with our world.

39:05.418 --> 39:07.078
A person's birth

39:07.568 --> 39:10.701
is the essential point
of the world creation.

39:12.693 --> 39:14.668
By overcoming the fear

39:15.435 --> 39:21.126
and recovering the
faith inside the person,

39:23.076 --> 39:29.151
it's possible to help
even the terminally ill...

39:29.251 --> 39:33.735
Do you mean you can enter her mind
to find the reason for her illness?

39:35.243 --> 39:36.678
It's not that easy.

39:36.768 --> 39:39.786
Please help us, Father Herman!

39:39.876 --> 39:42.655
What you want to do
is very dangerous.

39:43.043 --> 39:45.311
More dangerous than death?

39:45.401 --> 39:48.962
Which you will be responsible for
if you don't help us.

39:49.934 --> 39:51.656
Please, for Mirra.

39:54.148 --> 39:55.681
You must know that

39:55.771 --> 39:59.103
only a close person or a relative
can enter her in the other world.

39:59.193 --> 40:02.160
Your sister has her own
secrets deep inside

40:04.020 --> 40:08.405
and she will not allow me
to see inside her.

40:09.009 --> 40:12.126
But I know how to help
you to connect with her.

40:19.785 --> 40:24.001
"To establish the connection you need
to remember every detail,

40:24.551 --> 40:27.751
moments of her happiness,
troubles and fears.

40:28.126 --> 40:31.335
You need to understand her world...

40:32.085 --> 40:34.943
and believe in it."

41:37.818 --> 41:39.001
Tell me,

41:39.368 --> 41:41.085
what is it like?

41:43.493 --> 41:45.101
Like sleeping,

41:45.918 --> 41:49.536
but to discover the
reason why she's so sick

41:49.626 --> 41:51.835
you'll need a lot of energy.

41:52.043 --> 41:54.061
Do you feel strong enough?

41:54.151 --> 41:55.818
I do, trust me.

41:56.626 --> 41:59.328
She's been sick for a long time.

41:59.418 --> 42:03.235
Her world is full of pain,
similar to a nightmare.

42:04.826 --> 42:08.960
The deeper to the bottom of the
ocean, the darker it gets.

42:09.151 --> 42:12.170
"The Kamlanie is a magic ritual

42:12.260 --> 42:15.036
that involves both
patient and shaman.

42:15.126 --> 42:19.170
In an altered state of conciousness
the shaman travels to the other world

42:19.260 --> 42:21.870
and changes his patient's
ideas of reality,

42:21.960 --> 42:24.376
including the one of being ill."

42:24.985 --> 42:27.026
You need to start with this.

42:32.585 --> 42:36.043
Don't worry,
I'll my the best to help you.

44:36.210 --> 44:38.876
It will hurt a lot, Ayia.

44:39.360 --> 44:42.670
Remember, no matter what
you see you cannot go away.

44:42.760 --> 44:45.693
Ok. But you will always
be near me, right?

44:46.451 --> 44:48.160
I can only observe.

44:51.985 --> 44:53.576
Close your eyes!

47:06.085 --> 47:08.745
Mirra... Who has tied you up?

47:08.835 --> 47:10.168
Go away!

47:11.085 --> 47:13.168
She'll come soon!

47:14.335 --> 47:16.043
Who is she?

47:16.585 --> 47:19.543
Look under my blanket...

47:19.985 --> 47:23.018
Mother is eating me
from the inside.

47:27.293 --> 47:29.668
Why is mother doing this to you?

47:33.043 --> 47:35.203
Because I'm guilty of her death!

47:35.293 --> 47:37.418
I should have helped her!

47:37.668 --> 47:39.835
No! You didn't kill her!

47:40.318 --> 47:42.865
It was her fate.

47:42.955 --> 47:45.460
We couldn't do anything!

47:46.918 --> 47:49.876
I'm ready to share
this pain with you!

47:56.793 --> 47:59.501
You have to open the door.

50:24.926 --> 50:26.510
It worked.

50:28.035 --> 50:30.876
I saw what was inside her...

50:32.501 --> 50:34.335
Your amulet...

50:34.785 --> 50:36.445
It was there.

50:37.235 --> 50:39.536
It was guiding me to come back.

50:39.626 --> 50:42.835
Then, she helped you in the same way.

50:44.876 --> 50:47.460
She still has no power.

50:47.876 --> 50:51.876
She is just sleeping now,
she needs it.

50:59.535 --> 51:02.636
"These symbols are 1000 years old,

51:02.726 --> 51:06.918
Father Herman explained it to me.

51:07.510 --> 51:10.795
Long ago,
when he started to serve God,

51:10.885 --> 51:14.320
Father used to devote himself
wholly to the faith and people.

51:14.410 --> 51:17.068
He helped every citizen,

51:17.235 --> 51:21.168
but the closest person
to him was a little boy.

51:21.418 --> 51:23.820
The little boy was an orphan

51:23.910 --> 51:28.368
and Herman tried to
act like a good father.

51:28.518 --> 51:31.953
At a very young age the boy
developed interest in spiritual ideas

51:32.043 --> 51:35.245
and Father Herman was sure
that he had found somebody

51:35.335 --> 51:36.703
to follow his path.

51:36.793 --> 51:40.545
But after some time Father Herman
had to face the hard fate

51:40.635 --> 51:42.995
the six-year-old
boy had to endure.

51:43.085 --> 51:44.845
He became seriously ill.

51:44.935 --> 51:48.353
For several weeks, the
Father didn't leave the boy

51:48.443 --> 51:51.251
and put all of his
energy into praying...

51:52.043 --> 51:55.043
But the boy died.

52:01.143 --> 52:04.051
For the first time he
doubted his faith...

52:04.151 --> 52:09.651
He asked himself:
Does God listen to me?

52:15.626 --> 52:17.210
Why?

52:26.701 --> 52:29.286
That night, when
Father Herman got home,

52:29.376 --> 52:32.710
an old man appeared.
He had recently visited him,

52:32.876 --> 52:35.835
just before his death.

52:36.001 --> 52:39.245
The Father had heard
his confession,

52:39.335 --> 52:43.285
and given him the Holy Communion.

52:44.101 --> 52:49.085
How is it possible
that he was still alive?

52:50.135 --> 52:53.710
And so the old man explained
it to Father Herman.

52:54.001 --> 52:57.161
Some weeks later the Father
set out to the mountains

52:57.251 --> 52:59.476
in search of the healing power.

52:59.626 --> 53:02.010
The local shaman told him

53:02.176 --> 53:04.370
not to lose faith

53:04.460 --> 53:06.661
and introduced to him the secrets

53:06.751 --> 53:09.918
of an ancient magic practise.
Kamlanie."

53:26.143 --> 53:29.845
Father Herman, it's the doctor
who tried to separate!

53:29.935 --> 53:32.168
Please don't open the door!

53:33.485 --> 53:35.070
I cannot lie, Ayia.

53:35.160 --> 53:38.143
Then don't open the door.
Please!

53:57.843 --> 54:01.293
Don't run away from
things that scare you.

54:01.826 --> 54:04.610
You need to face them.

56:16.551 --> 56:19.335
Do you remember our mill?

56:20.601 --> 56:24.918
He used to bring me here
in order to please him.

56:26.076 --> 56:30.001
Mother didn't know
that he was doing it to me...

56:31.343 --> 56:35.426
The different blood I have
inside me caused his desire.

56:35.901 --> 56:38.293
I couldn't even imagine...

56:39.301 --> 56:42.160
We loved him like our own dad.

56:42.551 --> 56:46.585
He threatened me that
if anybody found out

56:47.235 --> 56:50.193
he would hang me on this hook...

56:52.076 --> 56:53.185
Mirra...

56:53.335 --> 56:55.726
He had power over me!

57:00.401 --> 57:02.085
I'll show you...

57:54.610 --> 57:57.818
They used to live in our village.

58:00.610 --> 58:04.401
They do still but can't forgive
themselves because of him...

58:30.668 --> 58:32.501
I wanted it myself!

58:32.918 --> 58:34.568
I wanted it myself...

58:35.668 --> 58:37.301
I wanted it myself...

58:39.043 --> 58:41.618
I wanted it myself...
I wanted it myself...

58:42.168 --> 58:44.018
I wanted it myself...

58:45.810 --> 58:48.085
No, I didn't want it!

58:54.210 --> 58:55.860
I was teasing him...

58:57.210 --> 58:59.735
I was teasing him...
I was teasing him.

59:00.585 --> 59:02.961
Don't blame yourself,

59:03.051 --> 59:05.243
he is no longer with us!

59:07.126 --> 59:11.210
He was punished by God!

01:00:13.418 --> 01:00:15.460
Don't hurry, Ayia.

01:00:17.393 --> 01:00:20.126
-Where is she?
-I put her on the floor.

01:00:23.843 --> 01:00:25.586
She gets weaker and weaker.

01:00:25.676 --> 01:00:28.410
It gets harder for you
to come back too.

01:00:28.818 --> 01:00:31.060
Yes, but I still have energy.

01:00:32.668 --> 01:00:34.443
She doesn't wake up.

01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:37.328
You haven't found
the main reason.

01:00:37.418 --> 01:00:40.403
She experienced everything you saw.

01:00:40.493 --> 01:00:42.553
Therefore it's harder for her.

01:00:42.643 --> 01:00:45.043
Let me try again.

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:48.993
Don't you need time to recover?

01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:51.876
No, I want to help her now!

01:00:52.901 --> 01:00:56.085
You have to find her deepest fear.

01:00:56.876 --> 01:01:01.935
The book says only killing the heart
of her fear will stop the disease.

01:01:02.851 --> 01:01:06.585
If you don't find it,
she will die.

01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:08.760
I understand.

01:02:22.418 --> 01:02:25.251
I miss you so much.

01:02:32.351 --> 01:02:35.210
Nobody is here,
it's only you and me...

01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:38.001
I feel so well and calm inside,

01:02:38.168 --> 01:02:39.126
Ayia.

01:02:39.576 --> 01:02:42.501
Nothing can happen to you here.

01:02:43.151 --> 01:02:44.126
To me?

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:45.251
Yes.

01:02:48.526 --> 01:02:51.485
What are you most
afraid of right now?

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:01.668
Of losing my dear sister...

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:08.245
"But the book says,
only killing the heart of the fear

01:03:08.335 --> 01:03:11.376
will stop the disease.
I have to do it."

01:03:12.335 --> 01:03:15.460
Then you're afraid
that I might die?

01:03:20.126 --> 01:03:22.418
Ayia, stay here!

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:49.918
My knife!

01:03:53.418 --> 01:03:55.001
It's not there...

01:03:55.168 --> 01:03:58.626
How could she know in her
mind that I was hiding it here?

01:04:00.593 --> 01:04:01.918
Mirra...

01:04:02.810 --> 01:04:05.585
Soon everything will be
as it used to be...

01:04:29.268 --> 01:04:31.626
I will save you now...

01:04:32.418 --> 01:04:34.801
I will kill your fear...

01:08:12.626 --> 01:08:14.335
Mother...

01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:15.710
Mirra!

01:09:02.835 --> 01:09:04.417
Ayia...

01:09:13.068 --> 01:09:16.676
You are wondering
whether I'm real

01:09:17.443 --> 01:09:20.792
or just part of
your imagination?

01:09:22.926 --> 01:09:25.028
If I'm in your imagination,

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.310
what is my mission here?

01:09:28.667 --> 01:09:31.210
And, if I'm real,

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:34.251
how do I happen to be here...?

01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:36.376
Well?

01:09:36.792 --> 01:09:39.303
Ayia,
either you answer me or not,

01:09:39.393 --> 01:09:41.335
I know what's on your mind.

01:09:41.501 --> 01:09:43.335
Where's my sister?

01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:47.501
Where we left her...

01:09:47.768 --> 01:09:49.335
In my house.

01:09:50.026 --> 01:09:52.975
Don't you want to know
where we are now?

01:09:54.876 --> 01:09:56.335
Self-sacrifice...

01:09:56.801 --> 01:09:59.418
Honestly, I was surprised.

01:09:59.751 --> 01:10:02.661
It is a very pure act, Ayia!

01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:04.543
And I was thinking,

01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:09.518
why can't you be part
of "my world" with God's will?

01:10:22.626 --> 01:10:24.668
Stop being scared

01:10:24.835 --> 01:10:28.210
or you will see what
you fear most now!

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:33.168
Once I heard a voice...

01:10:33.835 --> 01:10:36.543
It was the voice of God himself.

01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:41.326
Everything that
happened to me and you...

01:10:41.418 --> 01:10:43.793
Please Father Herman...

01:11:02.385 --> 01:11:03.793
Listen to me!

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.293
My gift is God's will.

01:11:08.068 --> 01:11:12.168
The truth is that he created
our world in his subconscious

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:16.460
and allowed the chosen ones
to create their own world as well.

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:22.585
I am afraid I cannot let you go...

01:11:27.118 --> 01:11:30.135
Please welcome... Ayia!

01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:43.378
My children,

01:11:43.468 --> 01:11:45.785
you will be Adam and Eve,

01:11:45.893 --> 01:11:49.335
the first ones in my new world...

01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:06.460
Ayia!

01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:07.876
Ayia!

01:14:02.601 --> 01:14:03.870
I saw them,

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.335
they were laying in the
basement, unconscious.

01:15:06.739 --> 01:15:10.262
ONE YEAR LATER

01:15:33.443 --> 01:15:35.460
"I'll always be with you.

01:15:35.751 --> 01:15:39.610
And I'll be waiting until
you come back.

01:15:40.251 --> 01:15:42.851
Every day
I keep asking God for it...

01:15:43.318 --> 01:15:46.535
Ayia, please come back..."
