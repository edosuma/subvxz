14:26.866 --> 14:30.453
Well, he probably
just got the time
mixed up.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.038
I can bear
a little heatstroke,

14:32.079 --> 14:34.666
but the aspic I made
especially for your brother

14:34.708 --> 14:36.083
is simply
gonna melt.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.211

to penetrate
the perimeter.

14:38.252 --> 14:41.798

I'll extinguish them.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.008

14:44.050 --> 14:46.260

a Sonic Blaster, whatever,

Could my Early Burly
Sweetie Tops

15:14.914 --> 15:18.543
have maybe misheard
his big brother
on the phone?

15:18.585 --> 15:22.422
No way. He definitely said,
"Come on over, little brother.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.716
You're on
full scholarship
at my house."

you and your brother
were close.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.780
Oh, well,
we are.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.282
You never told me
that Jim had kids.

17:56.951 --> 18:00.788
Well, huh, yeah,
I thought I mentioned
them to you, honey.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.290
So you're sure
he's gonna
trade with you?

18:03.332 --> 18:06.168

Yeah. Uh-huh.
For sure, honey.

It's nasty, nasty.

Where'd you
put Jim's gift?

19:27.125 --> 19:30.044
Uh, thought I put it
right there
on the coffee table.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.464
Maybe it was
abducted by aliens.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.801
Or maybe
your brother's house
is haunted.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.847
Oh, you know,
that's just
plain silly.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.932
Maybe I left it
in the car.

Nothing to be scared of, Earl.
You're a big boy, Earl.

Well, I don't take orders
from a one-issue wonder.

At least she's
based on someone.
You're based on no one.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.214
You're nothing but a generic.

things from humans.

would collect you.

at the top of his game,

it's keep a cool head

Stay down
until I give you a signal.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.166
I'll distract the enemy,
while you make a run for cover
in the house.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.793
That's what I would do.

-Proper Bob-sweet.
-Glad to be of service.

At least he doesn't smell
like cabbage anymore.

I, uh, I'm better
at catching a fly ball
than a wet cat.

37:25.118 --> 37:29.081
[giggles] You know, 'cause I
don't catch those normally.

37:29.122 --> 37:30.582
For sure. It's chill.

our future plans are shot.

it's like it's got legs

[Binky] It's not in the car,
not on the coffee table,

38:19.047 --> 38:22.634

investigated the refrigerator.

38:22.675 --> 38:23.843
Where is it?

Hey! Here it is!

Oh, bless your heart.
You found it.

Now all we got to do is
find the other bobblehead.

Other bobblehead?

[Earl] I kinda think
we should wait
till Jim gets home, Binks.

I'm sure they'll be home
any minute.

something about, uh...

on that baseball bobblehead

39:09.139 --> 39:10.932
We could stay here.

I guess
Jim wouldn't mind.

we're family, right?

in the morning.

one of us for Deuce?

So, Kelani,

is this the only reason
you unwrapped me?

Yes, and I missed you.

43:44.456 --> 43:46.082
[Purrbles] Well, well.

43:46.124 --> 43:49.419
How do you suppose
he got out of his box?

43:49.461 --> 43:51.087
We, um...

43:51.129 --> 43:53.839
Forgot to give him his bat,
and check it,

43:53.881 --> 43:56.884
Earl's giving him to Jim.
So he's gonna be
crashing here anyhow.

43:56.926 --> 43:58.761
Yeah, in place of one of us.

43:58.803 --> 44:00.638
I'm not leaving Bella.

44:00.679 --> 44:04.100
And I'm not going to live with
that low-life thief Binky,
and her...

44:04.142 --> 44:06.936
Low-life thief?
What's your hassle?

44:06.978 --> 44:09.688
Seems like you
fit right in, cat burglar.

44:11.441 --> 44:13.192
Maybe they want you.

44:13.234 --> 44:15.320
And wouldn't that be rich?

44:15.361 --> 44:18.364
They take you
and Deuce gets left here.

44:18.406 --> 44:20.950
It's so<i> Romeo and Juliet.</i>

44:20.992 --> 44:23.286
So,<i> Titanic.</i>

44:23.328 --> 44:25.204
And you know,
three of them died.

44:25.246 --> 44:26.831
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Time out, team.

44:26.872 --> 44:29.542
Why don't we work together
and get rid of 'em?

44:29.584 --> 44:32.462
Then we can all
live happily ever after.

44:32.504 --> 44:34.547
I doubt they'll leave
without you.

44:34.589 --> 44:37.216
And furthermore,
I'm not getting involved.

44:37.258 --> 44:39.218
A bobble bobbles wisdom.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.928
That's not the creed,
Furball.

44:40.970 --> 44:43.764
Bobbles never bobble
in defending their humans!

44:43.806 --> 44:45.724
Where have you bobbles been?

44:45.766 --> 44:47.935
The creed is bobbles bobble

44:47.977 --> 44:49.228

-Nah, I'm...

45:16.839 --> 45:18.591

45:18.633 --> 45:22.345
Besides, I might have
strained a hamstring
getting off that unicorn.

45:22.387 --> 45:25.890
His prototype could knock
every ball out of the park.

45:25.931 --> 45:27.350
But, can he?

45:27.392 --> 45:29.394
Stop playing games, Furball.

45:29.435 --> 45:31.937
All right, put one
across the plate.

45:31.979 --> 45:33.981
If you can
pitch it that far.

doing it!

46:16.315 --> 46:18.067
Get over yourself.

46:18.109 --> 46:21.613
My proto was
a steezy mad athlete...

46:21.654 --> 46:24.115
Until she was
caught cheating.

46:24.156 --> 46:27.243
Putting grease
on her opponent's wheels

46:27.285 --> 46:30.455
and never competed again.

46:30.496 --> 46:32.331
That was low, McKitty.

46:32.373 --> 46:34.083
I don't know what to say.

46:34.125 --> 46:36.711
At least Deuce Gatlin
never cheated to win.

46:36.753 --> 46:38.463
That's disgraceful.

they should leave.

Years ago, when Earl
stole their father's

53:13.107 --> 53:15.526
I was the only one
he didn't want.

53:15.567 --> 53:17.987
He said I was worthless.

Well, maybe sister
digs cats or something.

53:20.698 --> 53:23.159
[Deuce] Well, she's certainly
not a dog person.

53:23.199 --> 53:25.119
[Purrbles] Huh, that's her
one redeeming quality.

53:29.540 --> 53:32.084

-It worked.

is on your paw.

55:24.822 --> 55:27.491

55:32.913 --> 55:35.291

gonna thank her?

55:35.331 --> 55:36.583
You could have been taken.

55:38.418 --> 55:40.296
I want to be taken.

55:40.336 --> 55:41.463
-What?
-Say what?

55:41.505 --> 55:43.632
I'm done residing
with inferiors.

55:43.674 --> 55:45.301

55:45.341 --> 55:48.304
Maybe have a place of honor
in the bobblehead museum.

55:48.344 --> 55:51.307
I'll be worshiped
like Cher and Deuce.

55:51.347 --> 55:53.851
What about Audrey?
She needs you.

55:55.519 --> 55:57.604
She is better off alone.

55:57.646 --> 56:00.691
Like she says,
people just disappoint you.

56:01.233 --> 56:02.693
They sure do.

56:03.359 --> 56:05.070
So long, losers.

56:08.866 --> 56:10.492
What you got there, boy?

56:11.910 --> 56:16.207

that stupid dog
had it all along.

56:16.957 --> 56:18.167

56:18.209 --> 56:21.879
Did you just call
Dumpster stupid?

56:21.920 --> 56:23.421
Uh, did I?

56:23.463 --> 56:25.381
I meant stupendous!

56:28.302 --> 56:31.347
Well, you better let me
hang on to it for safekeeping,
honey bucket.

56:31.387 --> 56:35.100
No, that would be stealing
from my own brother.

56:35.142 --> 56:37.519
Never been his fault
I'm a loser.

56:37.561 --> 56:41.023
You've always been a loser,
but you don't have to be.

56:41.065 --> 56:45.110

and you and me,
we can go places.

56:46.111 --> 56:48.697

-Dumpster. Let's go, boy.

[thud]

57:42.334 --> 57:46.297
Oh, you think that
I'm gonna sell that cat
to the highest bidder, huh?

57:46.338 --> 57:49.133
You think
I'm as stupid as you?

57:49.174 --> 57:53.553
I'm gonna use him as a mold
and make a thousand copies.

57:53.595 --> 57:55.722
[vocalizing]

57:55.764 --> 57:58.683
That's right. I'll pass
every one of them off

57:58.725 --> 58:00.769
as the real one,
the real one!

58:00.811 --> 58:02.854
And it was my idea.

58:02.896 --> 58:05.732
-Binky?
-That's enough out of you.

58:05.774 --> 58:10.362
I'm gonna get a good night's
sleep, me in the kind of
house that I deserve,

58:10.404 --> 58:12.281
and you in here.

58:12.323 --> 58:15.200
And then tomorrow,
I'll get rich.

58:15.242 --> 58:17.661
It's all for me!

58:19.037 --> 58:20.331
[kisses]

58:30.007 --> 58:33.969
[Kelani] Don't worry.
You won't have to stay here
with us losers.

58:34.011 --> 58:37.639
We'll leave this house.
They'll know how posh you are.

58:37.681 --> 58:41.018
They'll surely send you
straight to
the bobblehead museum

58:41.059 --> 58:43.770
where you'll be
worshiped by all.

58:43.812 --> 58:46.190
And be on
the Bobble High Council.

58:47.732 --> 58:50.777
Kelani,
I'm sorry about Deuce.

58:50.819 --> 58:53.989
Not your fault he turned out
to be such a faker.

58:54.031 --> 58:56.867
Not his fault
my prototype is a big letdown.

59:07.961 --> 59:11.382
But you were
so bobbalicious.

59:11.423 --> 59:14.426
Why couldn't my proto
be someone steezy
like you peeps?

59:14.468 --> 59:17.179
Someone famous,
and fabulous, and loved.

59:17.221 --> 59:18.638

you're so dumb,

[Kelani] Your lucky day.

1:00:38.302 --> 1:00:41.805
Binky probably
forgot something
like the silver.

Where's Binky?

1:01:34.358 --> 1:01:36.151
Big Bad Bink's
in the bubble bath.

1:01:36.193 --> 1:01:37.902
Purrbles is prisoner
in her pack.

1:01:37.944 --> 1:01:40.197
He's lucky.
I was in Earl's mouth.

1:01:40.238 --> 1:01:41.615
Binky knocked him out.

1:01:41.657 --> 1:01:43.741
-[Kelani] No way!
-[Ikioi] What a traitor.

1:01:43.783 --> 1:01:45.869
She's been
stringing him along
to get to Purrbles.

1:01:45.910 --> 1:01:48.413
-She's gonna use him as a mold
to make copies of him.
-What?

1:01:48.455 --> 1:01:51.166
[Purrbles] I knew
I'd made a terrible mistake.

1:01:51.208 --> 1:01:53.502
Purrbles, what happened
to you?

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:57.673
I've seen things
no bobblehead should
ever have to see.

1:01:57.714 --> 1:02:00.300
[hiccups] We should never have
left our bases.

1:02:00.342 --> 1:02:02.553
We're in over
our bobble-heads.

1:02:02.594 --> 1:02:04.721
Maybe McKitty is right.

1:02:04.762 --> 1:02:07.182
Yeah. This has been
one big flail.

1:02:07.224 --> 1:02:08.850

Do we need these
big entrances every time?

1:02:41.758 --> 1:02:44.428
Also the fog, it can't be
good for the environment.

1:02:49.807 --> 1:02:51.809
Hey, bobbles,
how's it going?

1:02:53.687 --> 1:02:56.607
-[Purrbles gasps]
-You're you! You're Cher?

1:02:56.648 --> 1:02:58.191
I'm Bobblehead Cher.

You know,
don't get me wrong,
Cher's great,

1:03:00.110 --> 1:03:02.112
but I'm my own bobblehead.

1:03:02.153 --> 1:03:06.032
And I'm a representative of
the Bobblehead High Council.

1:03:06.074 --> 1:03:08.285
Are you here
to arrest us?

1:03:08.326 --> 1:03:09.453
[Cher] For what?

1:03:09.494 --> 1:03:11.955
For breaking
the bobble creed.

1:03:11.996 --> 1:03:14.583
Yeah, we got to talk
about the creed.

1:03:14.625 --> 1:03:17.127
Come on up.
We're gonna go
to the VIP section.

1:03:19.003 --> 1:03:20.380

1:03:24.008 --> 1:03:26.511
Hey, Deuce!
Come on, dude.

1:03:30.766 --> 1:03:34.478
Deuce! Jump just before
the teeter-totter tips down.

1:03:34.519 --> 1:03:36.020
Just try.

1:03:36.062 --> 1:03:37.230
Yeah, you've got this.

1:03:37.981 --> 1:03:39.107
I don't.

1:03:39.149 --> 1:03:41.192
I'm not a rad athlete
like Kelani.

1:03:41.234 --> 1:03:42.653
I'm just a bobblehead.

1:03:42.694 --> 1:03:46.114
Deuce, the only reason
Kelani has...
How'd you put it?

1:03:46.156 --> 1:03:49.867
...steezy mad skills...
Is because she practices
her butt off.

1:03:49.909 --> 1:03:53.371
Now get your bobble-butt
up here.

1:03:53.413 --> 1:03:56.333
[exhales deeply]
Come on, Deuce.
You got this.

1:04:05.383 --> 1:04:07.927
Ha! [exclaims]
Will you look at that?

1:04:07.969 --> 1:04:09.513
-Rad!
-Outstanding, soldier.

1:04:09.554 --> 1:04:11.222
You bobble-bolted it.

1:04:11.264 --> 1:04:13.475
See, dude,
and with a little work,

1:04:13.517 --> 1:04:16.353
I bet you could improve
your batting average.
You know?

1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:18.772
Now, the creed.

1:04:18.814 --> 1:04:22.317
I don't know where you guys
are getting your info,
but it is wrong.

1:04:22.359 --> 1:04:23.735
But it's so simple.

1:04:23.777 --> 1:04:25.612
-Bobbles bobble wisdom.
-No, no, no, no. It's

-No, no. It's,

1:04:27.739 --> 1:04:29.157
-you gotta be righteous...

1:04:31.368 --> 1:04:34.120
-No...
-Guys. Guys... Hold it.

1:04:34.162 --> 1:04:36.414
The bobble creed
is simple.

1:04:36.456 --> 1:04:39.209
Bobbles bobble
and bring joy.

1:04:41.211 --> 1:04:42.754
That's it?

1:04:42.796 --> 1:04:45.048
How can I bring joy
when my proto's
a total sleazeball?

1:04:45.089 --> 1:04:48.719
Kelani,
you're trying so hard
not to be her,

1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:50.303
you're not being you.

1:04:50.345 --> 1:04:53.306
Don't you realize
you have got
everything you need.

1:04:57.352 --> 1:04:59.020
And, Deuce,

1:04:59.062 --> 1:05:03.608
man, maybe you can't do
everything your proto can,
but so what?

1:05:03.650 --> 1:05:06.194
You're kind
and you're compassionate.

1:05:06.236 --> 1:05:09.113
Deuce, you're a good guy.

1:05:09.155 --> 1:05:11.700
And maybe I can learn
to hit a ball or two.

1:05:11.742 --> 1:05:13.076
[glass shatters]

1:05:14.452 --> 1:05:15.912

1:05:15.953 --> 1:05:17.955
At least his weapon
is effective.

1:05:17.997 --> 1:05:19.457
Oh, Ikioi.

1:05:19.499 --> 1:05:23.044
Being a true hero
isn't about having
a better weapon.

1:05:23.086 --> 1:05:26.297
It's about having the courage
to protect those you love.

1:05:26.339 --> 1:05:28.800
And you've proven that
over and over again.

1:05:28.842 --> 1:05:31.720
We would be lost without
your tactical skills, Iki...

1:05:32.470 --> 1:05:33.471
...oi.

1:05:35.014 --> 1:05:37.225
Purrbles, what can I say?

1:05:37.267 --> 1:05:40.270
You are literally
one of a kind.

1:05:40.311 --> 1:05:41.730
Embrace it.

1:05:41.772 --> 1:05:43.481
That's what my proto did.

1:05:43.523 --> 1:05:45.483
But what if we're never
as good as our protos?

1:05:45.525 --> 1:05:48.069
Then find your own way
to bring joy!

1:05:48.111 --> 1:05:50.488
You don't have to live
under anybody's shadow.

1:05:50.530 --> 1:05:52.908
When you put your
bobble-heads together,

1:05:52.949 --> 1:05:55.452
you can achieve anything.

1:05:55.493 --> 1:05:58.162
But, Cher, can't you
stay with us?

1:05:58.204 --> 1:05:59.205
-Yeah!
-Join the team!

1:05:59.247 --> 1:06:00.248
-Let's do it.
-Come on!

1:06:00.290 --> 1:06:01.750
-Please.
-I'm sorry, bobbles.

who need me.

1:06:05.378 --> 1:06:06.713
But, what if we need
your help again?

1:06:06.755 --> 1:06:08.965
You won't. You've got
each other!

1:06:09.006 --> 1:06:10.383
Now, bobble on!

Sorry, girls,

abducting me.

1:10:48.078 --> 1:10:49.579
I'm out of here.

you blue-haired
crime against nature!

1:11:09.724 --> 1:11:10.808
We've got to save them!

1:11:12.602 --> 1:11:14.687
-That's it!
-Uh, what are we doing?

1:11:15.438 --> 1:11:17.732
Ha! [gasps]

[Deuce] Uh, Kelani,
is this thing safe?

Absolutely not!

1:11:49.388 --> 1:11:50.640
[Kelani] Hold on!

1:11:52.267 --> 1:11:54.560
I'll squish you and then
I'll go to your little planet,

1:11:54.602 --> 1:11:56.604
and I'll squish all
of them like you.

1:11:56.646 --> 1:11:57.772
[Ikioi] Help!

1:11:57.814 --> 1:12:00.775

you're gonna wish you'd
never hatched out of
of your little space egg!

1:12:12.245 --> 1:12:14.122
Nowhere to run,
you little runt.

1:12:14.164 --> 1:12:16.166
Back off!

1:12:16.207 --> 1:12:17.750
[gasps] What?

1:12:17.792 --> 1:12:21.004

-Kelani!

who wants some!

1:12:56.372 --> 1:12:57.748

a tower of what now?

1:13:00.293 --> 1:13:01.502
[all gasping]

1:13:03.046 --> 1:13:04.047

[Ikioi grunts] Target lock!

1:13:07.091 --> 1:13:08.343
[Deuce grunts] We did it!
We...

1:13:08.801 --> 1:13:11.721
[all groan]

1:13:13.681 --> 1:13:14.891
Ow!

1:13:15.474 --> 1:13:16.559
[gasps]

1:13:21.981 --> 1:13:26.194
I don't know how
you managed all this
Dumpy, but good boy.

1:13:26.236 --> 1:13:28.112
You trussed her up
like a turkey.

1:13:29.197 --> 1:13:30.948
How'd you get in here?

1:13:30.990 --> 1:13:32.158
Earl, you're not gonna
believe this.

1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:33.701
No. These ain't
bobbleheads.

1:13:33.743 --> 1:13:34.952
Come here, come here.

1:13:34.994 --> 1:13:37.330
They're space aliens.
Yeah, you were right.

1:13:37.372 --> 1:13:39.165
I think they tried
to probe me.

1:13:39.207 --> 1:13:42.377
Oh, well, look who's
been somnambulating.

1:13:42.418 --> 1:13:44.587
Come on,
Binky Stinky!

1:13:44.628 --> 1:13:45.796
The good news?

1:13:45.838 --> 1:13:48.758
You're finally gonna get
your big old house.

1:13:48.799 --> 1:13:52.970
The bad news, it's got
a lot of bars on the window.

1:13:53.012 --> 1:13:55.556
Yes!
Outstanding, McCat!

1:13:55.598 --> 1:13:57.225
Masterful, Ikioi.

1:13:57.267 --> 1:13:59.727
I salute you.
They're gone for good.

1:13:59.769 --> 1:14:00.895
[Kelani sighs]

1:14:01.771 --> 1:14:04.399
I can't believe
he's gone.

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:07.735
You never know, Kelani.
Maybe Deuce will be back.

1:14:07.777 --> 1:14:09.237
And you still have us.

1:14:09.279 --> 1:14:10.905
For whatever
that's worth.

1:14:13.741 --> 1:14:16.619
It's worth more than
all the money in the world.

1:14:30.633 --> 1:14:31.634
[gags]

1:14:42.770 --> 1:14:44.814
[Kelani] Nope, that goes
into bracket B.

1:14:44.855 --> 1:14:46.482
Nice work, Ikioi!

1:14:46.523 --> 1:14:49.485
Um, let's try
piece K with A.

1:14:49.526 --> 1:14:50.653
[Purrbles] Ingenious!

1:14:57.452 --> 1:15:00.788
Maybe we'll have better luck
fixing Harvey's
fish food feeder.

1:15:00.830 --> 1:15:02.539
Two bobbleheads
are better than one.

1:15:03.291 --> 1:15:04.625
Make that three.

1:15:06.043 --> 1:15:07.462
-[Kelani] Race you!
-[Purrbles] Not fair.

1:15:07.503 --> 1:15:08.921
You got
a bobble-head start.

1:15:08.963 --> 1:15:10.131
[Ikioi laughs]

1:15:10.173 --> 1:15:13.092
[all singing]

1:15:15.511 --> 1:15:17.096
[Audrey] Thanks again, kids.

1:15:17.138 --> 1:15:20.433
I mean, Mom and Dad,
for the super fun weekend.

1:15:20.475 --> 1:15:22.268
You've got it,
little lady.

1:15:22.310 --> 1:15:24.770
We'll start planning
our next one.

1:15:24.812 --> 1:15:25.855
[instrumental music playing]

1:15:29.108 --> 1:15:30.193
Harvey!

1:15:31.694 --> 1:15:33.529
[Jim] Looks like he
missed you, sweetie.

1:15:34.155 --> 1:15:35.531
Welcome home, Bella.

1:15:37.116 --> 1:15:38.784
Purrbles.

1:15:38.826 --> 1:15:40.828
I made some new friends
at Oasis Rancho,

1:15:40.870 --> 1:15:42.788
and two of them
live near here.

1:15:44.248 --> 1:15:45.541
Should I invite them over?

1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:52.673
[laughs] Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1:15:58.221 --> 1:16:01.765
Hey, did you reverse
the bracket on
the turn here?

1:16:01.807 --> 1:16:04.477
No, angle looks off too.

1:16:15.779 --> 1:16:17.698
[gasps] No fatalities!

1:16:17.740 --> 1:16:18.949
-[Jim] It works!
-[both laugh]

1:16:18.991 --> 1:16:21.494
-[doorbell ringing]
-I'll get that.

1:16:21.536 --> 1:16:23.496
Hear that, sweetie?
Nobody died.

1:16:23.538 --> 1:16:25.415
-No, they didn't.
No, they didn't.
-[laughs]

1:16:30.378 --> 1:16:31.421
Earl.

1:16:33.464 --> 1:16:35.174
A Deuce bobblehead?

1:16:35.216 --> 1:16:38.302
I know this doesn't make up
for me taking
Dad's collection.

1:16:38.344 --> 1:16:39.595
It don't.

1:16:39.636 --> 1:16:41.556
I guess I just got
a little wrapped up

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:43.140
in you having
all the luck

1:16:43.182 --> 1:16:44.392
and not me.

1:16:44.434 --> 1:16:48.312
But all this comparing
got me nowhere and fast.

1:16:48.354 --> 1:16:52.358
I just spoiled good times
we could have had
as brothers.

1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:55.528
And I gotta confess
I was going to trade this guy

1:16:55.570 --> 1:16:57.196
for the old cat bobble.

1:16:57.238 --> 1:16:59.115
See, he's worth
a lot of dough.

1:16:59.156 --> 1:17:01.867
-You can sell him.
-[Jim] Purrbles McCat?

1:17:01.909 --> 1:17:03.327
I'd never sell him.

1:17:03.369 --> 1:17:05.871
Audrey loves him,
so he's priceless.

1:17:08.624 --> 1:17:11.627
I haven't kept up
the collecting tradition
like Dad,

1:17:11.668 --> 1:17:14.964
but I did buy a skater bobble
for Rosa on our first date

1:17:15.005 --> 1:17:17.633
and a comic book character
when Bella was born.

1:17:17.674 --> 1:17:20.052
So they all have
special meaning for me.

1:17:22.012 --> 1:17:23.847
And now this
guy will, too.

1:17:26.517 --> 1:17:29.270
-Why don't you come on in?
-[laughs]

1:17:33.023 --> 1:17:37.236
Rosa, this is my
little brother, Earl.

1:17:37.278 --> 1:17:39.572
Nice to finally
meet you, Rosa.

1:17:39.614 --> 1:17:41.824
This here's Dumpster.

1:17:41.865 --> 1:17:44.034
The best old dog
in the whole world.

1:17:44.076 --> 1:17:45.411
Welcome, Earl.

1:17:45.453 --> 1:17:47.121
I've heard a lot
about you.

1:17:47.163 --> 1:17:48.623
Kelani, meet Deuce.

1:17:51.626 --> 1:17:53.544
-How about some lunch?
-Sounds great.

1:17:53.586 --> 1:17:55.754
Hey, Audrey,
come meet your uncle.

1:17:55.796 --> 1:17:57.173
[Audrey] I have an uncle?

1:17:57.214 --> 1:17:58.966
[Earl] By the way,
y'all might be
low on pickles.

1:17:59.008 --> 1:18:00.843
What did I
tell you, Ikioi?

1:18:00.884 --> 1:18:02.845
A perfect match.

1:18:02.886 --> 1:18:04.013
Hey, guys!
