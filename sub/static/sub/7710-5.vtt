00:08.650 --> 00:10.589
Happy Halloween, everyone.

00:10.621 --> 00:12.493
Oh, that's great.
Hey.

00:12.526 --> 00:14.363
Happy Halloween.

00:14.397 --> 00:16.067
Jan called.

00:16.101 --> 00:19.372
O...kay.

00:19.407 --> 00:23.415
I know why she's calling.

00:23.447 --> 00:24.650
It's the end of the month,

00:24.682 --> 00:26.386
and I was supposed
to let somebody go

00:26.421 --> 00:28.091
by the end of the month.

00:29.692 --> 00:31.797
And somehow I'm supposed
to put on a costume and smile.

00:33.635 --> 00:35.438
Okay.

00:35.471 --> 00:36.641
Jan Levinson's office.

00:36.674 --> 00:38.845
Hey, Sherri,
Michael Scott returning.

00:38.877 --> 00:40.481
Oh, she's in a meeting.

00:40.514 --> 00:43.355
She just wanted the name
of the employee you let go.

00:43.387 --> 00:45.159
Well, I'm gonna wait 'til
the end of the day.

00:45.192 --> 00:47.629
Because the book said it's best
to wait 'til the end of the day.

00:47.663 --> 00:49.899
I just need the name of who
you're planning to let go.

00:49.932 --> 00:53.241
I..don't...know...yet.

00:53.275 --> 00:54.710
I will have to call her back.

00:54.743 --> 00:57.883
I know she wanted the name.

00:57.915 --> 00:59.519
Okay, Sherri?

00:59.552 --> 01:00.121
Yeah?

01:00.121 --> 01:04.630
If you were getting fired,
how would you wanna be told

01:04.663 --> 01:06.334
so that you could
still be friends

01:06.366 --> 01:09.672
with the person firing you?

01:09.707 --> 01:11.877
Jan wants the name as soon
as possible, Michael.

01:11.910 --> 01:13.780
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

01:13.814 --> 01:16.387
I'll call her back.

01:16.420 --> 01:19.359
Wish I could fire Sherri.

01:19.393 --> 01:20.962
Hey, I'm still here.
Okay.

01:20.994 --> 01:22.666
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

01:22.699 --> 01:23.668
No?
Okay.

01:23.701 --> 01:27.308
Bye.
Hanging up now.

01:31.316 --> 01:39.666
*

02:02.446 --> 02:05.718
I mean, you hear
about layoffs in the news,

02:05.752 --> 02:07.756
but when you actually have
to do it yourself,

02:07.789 --> 02:09.560
it is heavy stuff.

02:09.593 --> 02:10.928
It's--

02:10.961 --> 02:14.302
I mean, these are people's lives
you're talking about.

02:14.337 --> 02:17.943
You wanted me?
Yes.

02:23.487 --> 02:25.558
Papier
Yes.

02:25.592 --> 02:27.596
Yesh.
Hmm.

02:27.628 --> 02:32.473
Um, Pam I have
to let somebody go today.

02:32.506 --> 02:35.479
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

02:35.512 --> 02:37.682
Why did you put it off
until Halloween?

02:37.715 --> 02:39.953
Because it's very scary stuff.

02:39.987 --> 02:42.459
Well, I think it's gonna put
a damper on the party a little.

02:42.493 --> 02:43.794
You're worried about the party?

02:43.828 --> 02:45.129
There's a man's
life at stake here.

02:45.162 --> 02:47.836
So it's a man?
No.

02:47.869 --> 02:50.107
Or a woman.
A human life.

02:50.139 --> 02:52.413
If you had to guess,

02:52.446 --> 02:55.985
who would it be,
based on their job performance?

02:56.019 --> 02:58.458
And who do you think
deserves to be fired?

02:58.491 --> 02:59.692
Who would that be?

02:59.726 --> 03:02.833
I just answer the phone.

03:02.866 --> 03:07.576
And sometimes you just let
it go to voice mail.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.822
Your costume is fantastic.

03:14.857 --> 03:17.795
I know.

03:17.828 --> 03:20.902
I sent away for it
in July from a catalog.

03:22.103 --> 03:24.443
Oh, no.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

03:24.477 --> 03:25.744
Aah.

03:26.813 --> 03:27.882
Okay.

03:27.916 --> 03:32.091
Oh, man.
Okay, I have to fire somebody.

03:36.501 --> 03:38.638
What is that?
What are you supposed to be?

03:38.670 --> 03:42.513
I'm a three-hole punch
version of Jim.

03:42.546 --> 03:43.948
'Cause he can have me
either way.

03:43.981 --> 03:46.219
Plain white Jim,
or three-hole punch.

03:46.252 --> 03:49.025
That's great.
Oh, yeah.

03:49.058 --> 03:51.930
Yeah, well, look.
What about me?

03:54.537 --> 03:57.808
What are you?
A monk?

03:57.842 --> 03:59.912
I am a Sith Lord.

04:02.217 --> 04:03.988
Oh, big deal.

04:04.020 --> 04:06.960
Three round pieces of paper
taped to his shirt.

04:06.994 --> 04:10.668
This cost me $129.

04:10.701 --> 04:12.873
Ass.

04:16.313 --> 04:18.650
Hey, you guys excited
about the party?

04:18.685 --> 04:21.923
It's gonna be fun.
Yeah.

04:21.956 --> 04:25.063
Oh, look at you.
Showing your colors.

04:25.097 --> 04:27.201
Bet you wish you wore
a dress every day.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.705
What are you implying?

04:28.737 --> 04:30.808
All good.
Happy Halloween.

04:30.842 --> 04:33.346
What happened to all those
spooky decorations that we had?

04:33.379 --> 04:36.052
The cobwebs and such?

04:36.085 --> 04:38.591
I don't know.
We put them all up last night.

04:42.064 --> 04:44.068
Well, you know what?
Go buy some more.

04:44.101 --> 04:45.639
I'll approve
the overages.

04:45.672 --> 04:47.107
Sound good?
Yeah.

04:47.141 --> 04:49.078
Good.

04:49.111 --> 04:53.987
Oh, yeah, also,
about budget stuff,

04:54.020 --> 04:55.123
um, I need a unified,
like a--

04:55.157 --> 04:59.733
a full employee salary
plus benefits, like 50 grand.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.904
I'm gonna need you to find
50 grand in the numbers.

05:01.936 --> 05:03.774
But we don't keep two cents--

05:03.808 --> 05:05.076
Well, that's not
what I'm saying.

05:05.110 --> 05:06.345
Just, you know, find it.

05:06.380 --> 05:09.150
Pretend that your
jobs depend on it.

05:15.464 --> 05:17.368
Mmm-hm-hmm.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.039
Interesting take on Dorothy.
I love it.

05:20.072 --> 05:21.811
Hey, you know what would
even be better?

05:21.843 --> 05:23.681
Soccer ball and cleats.

05:23.715 --> 05:24.982
Why is that?

05:25.017 --> 05:26.252
Bend It Like Beckham.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.323
Oh, like, the movie
about the Indian girl

05:28.356 --> 05:30.027
who plays soccer?

05:30.059 --> 05:31.429
Yeah.

05:31.463 --> 05:33.132
That would be perfect.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.071
Yeah, I mean, I guess
I could do that.

05:36.104 --> 05:38.444
I don't really play soccer
or anything.

05:38.476 --> 05:41.249
Well, I don't really
have two heads, so.

05:41.282 --> 05:43.987
Wait, what are you again?
Oh, right.

05:44.020 --> 05:45.490
Three-hole punch!

05:49.030 --> 05:51.302
Okay, greatest strength.

05:51.335 --> 05:53.407
Okay, okay.

05:53.439 --> 05:55.478
A doglike obedience
to authority.

05:55.510 --> 05:57.046
Nice.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.753
That doesn't sound good.
Okay, okay.

05:59.787 --> 06:03.359
Um, how 'bout
the ultimate team player?

06:03.393 --> 06:05.530
Dwight is special,

06:05.564 --> 06:08.469
but I don't believe that his
talents are being used

06:08.504 --> 06:10.107
in this office.

06:10.140 --> 06:12.111
So Pam and I have put his résumé

06:12.144 --> 06:15.819
on monster.com, Google,
craigslist.

06:15.851 --> 06:18.323
We're really interested
most in jobs

06:18.356 --> 06:20.092
that take Dwight
out of state.

06:20.127 --> 06:23.198
Um, preferably Alaska.
Or India.

06:23.232 --> 06:25.537
He's a gun nut.
Mmm.

06:25.571 --> 06:29.145
Sticks to his guns.

06:29.177 --> 06:31.349
Well, I looked through
all the budgets.

06:31.382 --> 06:33.152
And there is one department...
Yes?

06:33.185 --> 06:34.923
that has three people...
Yeah?

06:34.957 --> 06:37.126
Doing the work that could
be done by two.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.195
This is great.

06:39.598 --> 06:43.073
Oh.

06:43.105 --> 06:47.014
Yeah. Oh.

06:47.046 --> 06:49.117
Who do you think
it should be?
Jim, definitely.

06:49.150 --> 06:50.219
No, Jim brings in money.

06:50.252 --> 06:52.056
Phyllis.
Eh.

06:52.091 --> 06:56.032
Stanley. Pam.
Oscar. Meredith.

06:56.064 --> 06:58.537
Kevin. Angela.

06:58.569 --> 07:00.373
It's not a popularity contest.

07:00.407 --> 07:03.346
Although it does make sense
to fire the least popular,

07:03.378 --> 07:07.254
because it has the least
effect on morale.

07:07.286 --> 07:09.124
One of the warehouse guys.

07:09.158 --> 07:12.097
What?

07:12.130 --> 07:14.235
There was someone
left off that list?

07:14.268 --> 07:16.239
Who?
Who is he saying?

07:18.043 --> 07:20.413
You're right.
I didn't even think of him.

07:20.448 --> 07:22.485
No, Michael.

07:22.517 --> 07:24.320
Yeah, that's actually
a really good idea.

07:24.354 --> 07:27.293
No, not me.
Yeah, I could.

07:27.326 --> 07:28.998
Not Dwight.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.299
I'm not saying
that's what he said.

07:30.332 --> 07:32.004
I know that's what he said.

07:32.036 --> 07:34.240
What?

07:34.274 --> 07:36.179
Tell him not Dwight.

07:36.211 --> 07:38.315
That is not a very nice
thing to say about him.

07:38.348 --> 07:40.219
Tell him to stop.
Are you kidding?

07:40.252 --> 07:41.221
Quiet you.

07:41.254 --> 07:43.225
I agree.
He'd land on his feet.

07:43.258 --> 07:44.696
Make him be quiet.

07:48.203 --> 07:50.073
Those aren't chips and dip.

07:50.107 --> 07:52.310
No, I made brownies.

07:53.580 --> 07:54.815
What?

07:54.848 --> 07:58.089
I'm just trying to figure out
why you're sabotaging things.

07:58.123 --> 08:00.292
I made brownies.

08:00.326 --> 08:05.303
And I made cookies.
Same category.

08:05.337 --> 08:09.244
I'm guessing Angela's the one
in the neighborhood

08:09.278 --> 08:14.521
who gives the trick-or-treaters
some toothbrushes.

08:14.556 --> 08:16.759
Pennies.

08:16.793 --> 08:18.730
Walnuts.

08:18.763 --> 08:21.503
Dunder-Mifflin,
this is Pam.

08:21.536 --> 08:24.207
Uh, yeah.

08:24.241 --> 08:26.045
Just one second.

08:26.079 --> 08:29.017
I will transfer you
to our manager, Michael Scott.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.400
Michael Scott here.

08:37.433 --> 08:42.177
Yes, I am regional manager
of this orifice.

08:42.211 --> 08:44.215
Mmm-hmm.

08:44.248 --> 08:47.353
Dwight Schrute is amazing.

08:47.386 --> 08:48.824
Yeah.

08:48.856 --> 08:51.763
No, he is actually the single
greatest employee

08:51.795 --> 08:53.734
of his generation.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.302
Mmm-hmm.

08:55.337 --> 08:56.872
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what.

08:56.905 --> 08:59.310
You hire Dwight K. Schrute,

08:59.345 --> 09:01.081
and he does not meet, nay,

09:01.081 --> 09:05.890
exceed every one
of your wildest expectations,

09:05.924 --> 09:08.229
well, then you can hold me,

09:08.262 --> 09:10.733
Michael Gary Scott,

09:10.767 --> 09:13.473
personally and financially
responsible.

09:13.506 --> 09:15.443
Okay. Okay.

09:15.477 --> 09:17.513
Okay-kay-kay-kay.

09:17.546 --> 09:18.816
Okay.

09:24.394 --> 09:26.564
Stanley, could you come
with me, please.

09:26.599 --> 09:31.408
No.

09:31.442 --> 09:33.279
As assistant regional manager--

09:33.313 --> 09:35.183
To the--
Look.

09:35.217 --> 09:37.254
I've got some bad news.

09:37.287 --> 09:38.388
You're fired.

09:38.423 --> 09:40.293
You need to pack up
your things and go.

09:40.327 --> 09:42.597
I'm serious, Stanley.

09:42.631 --> 09:44.936
It's over, I'm sorry.

09:44.968 --> 09:46.806
You're fired.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.643
Get your fingers off my phone.

09:53.485 --> 09:56.860
So, how did it go with Stanley?

09:56.893 --> 09:58.396
How

09:58.428 --> 10:00.333
He wouldn't listen to me.
Oh, come on.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.638
If you wanna fire him, you're
gonna have to tell him yourself.

10:02.672 --> 10:04.809
I don't wanna fire Stanley.
I never said that.

10:04.842 --> 10:07.715
I'm certainly not going
to do it myself.

10:07.748 --> 10:11.388
Get those big, baleful
eyes staring at me.

10:11.421 --> 10:12.725
Yikes.

10:12.757 --> 10:14.962
Okay, just--

10:14.995 --> 10:18.435
Cumberland Mills?

10:18.469 --> 10:21.041
And how did you get
my résumé?

10:21.073 --> 10:22.978
Oh, no, no.
I'm very flattered.

10:23.011 --> 10:24.447
Don't get me wrong.

10:24.481 --> 10:27.386
I'm just not sure
that it's my official resume,

10:27.421 --> 10:30.427
or if it's something
that maybe

10:30.459 --> 10:33.800
a satisfied customer
posted online.

10:33.834 --> 10:37.407
What does it say under
martial arts training?

10:37.441 --> 10:40.713
Oh, okay, I'm gonna have
to supplement that.

10:40.747 --> 10:43.419
Could I have your fax number?

10:43.453 --> 10:45.423
Would I ever leave this company?

10:45.457 --> 10:47.025
Look, I'm all about loyalty.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.127
In fact, I feel like

10:48.161 --> 10:51.100
part of what I'm getting
paid for here is my loyalty.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.506
But if there were somewhere else

10:53.538 --> 10:56.043
that valued that loyalty
more highly,

10:56.078 --> 11:00.453
I'm going wherever
they value loyalty the most.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.095
Oh, hey.

11:05.128 --> 11:07.767
Oh, your dress is stuck
in the back.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.606
Oh.

11:13.512 --> 11:15.516
So you got the fax?

11:15.549 --> 11:17.620
So why didn't you add it
to the res--

11:17.654 --> 11:18.924
What do you mean?

11:18.957 --> 11:20.393
Of course martial arts training
is relevant.

11:20.427 --> 11:22.030
Oh, excuse me.

11:22.062 --> 11:24.768
I know about a billion Asians
that would beg to differ.

11:24.801 --> 11:27.640
Uh, yeah, I get
a little frustrated

11:27.674 --> 11:29.510
when I'm dealing
with incompetence.

11:29.545 --> 11:31.013
Well, you know what?
You can go to hell too.

11:31.048 --> 11:33.519
And I will see you there...
burning.

11:33.553 --> 11:35.457
Fine. Okay, wait.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.794
So you'll let me know
when you've made a decis--

11:42.202 --> 11:44.575
Jim is really talented.

11:44.608 --> 11:48.549
And he should be the one who's
getting a better job offer.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.551
Like, for real.

11:49.585 --> 11:50.887
Don't take this the wrong way,

11:50.921 --> 11:54.495
but you should go
for that job.

11:57.501 --> 12:00.873
Um, it's in Maryland.

12:00.907 --> 12:02.912
Yeah.

12:02.945 --> 12:04.515
But, I mean,
look at the salary.

12:04.548 --> 12:06.953
And it's definitely
a step up.

12:06.986 --> 12:09.557
And a challenge.

12:11.594 --> 12:14.200
Yeah.

12:15.636 --> 12:18.576
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe--

12:18.608 --> 12:22.584
Maybe I will.

12:24.319 --> 12:26.759
Jim...

12:26.793 --> 12:31.535
This is called leveraging
an offer.

12:31.569 --> 12:34.776
Michael, can I talk
to you for a moment?
Oh, God.

12:34.808 --> 12:36.579
I just thought you should know

12:36.612 --> 12:40.587
that I was just offered
a job with better pay,

12:40.620 --> 12:44.094
better benefits and a better
title at Cumberland Mills.

12:44.127 --> 12:45.663
Fantastic.

12:45.697 --> 12:46.632
And I turned it down.

12:46.665 --> 12:49.237
What? That would've
solved all my problems.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.709
Out of loyalty
to this company...

12:51.742 --> 12:53.277
Oh, you idiot.

12:53.312 --> 12:56.017
So I was hoping to be made
assistant regional manager.

12:56.051 --> 12:58.856
If you left,
I wouldn't have to fire anybody.

12:58.889 --> 13:00.259
But then you wouldn't
have me here.

13:00.291 --> 13:02.998
Big deal, oh, it would've
worked out so well.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.333
Can you get it back?

13:04.366 --> 13:05.637
It's in Maryland.

13:05.669 --> 13:06.872
You can call.
Can you call 'em?

13:06.906 --> 13:09.744
I can't--I--I suppose I--no.

13:09.777 --> 13:11.314
They never really made me
an offer anyway.

13:11.347 --> 13:13.920
Why are you torturing me?

13:13.954 --> 13:17.661
God.

13:17.694 --> 13:21.134
Honestly, I don't think that
Michael has the slightest clue

13:21.168 --> 13:22.937
of who he's going to fire.

13:22.972 --> 13:25.075
I think he keeps hoping that
someone's going to volunteer.

13:25.109 --> 13:28.816
Uh, or be run over
by a bus before the deadline.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.653
But in the end,
really what's going to happen is

13:30.687 --> 13:32.389
it's gonna be the first
person to give him

13:32.423 --> 13:33.425
a dirty look in the hall.

13:35.095 --> 13:38.101
And therein lies the true
essence of his charisma.

13:39.469 --> 13:41.910
Can I speak to you a minute?

13:41.942 --> 13:45.649
Um...yes.

14:08.028 --> 14:09.296
Michael, I really
didn't mean to--

14:09.330 --> 14:11.400
Help me.

14:11.434 --> 14:12.938
I'm sorry?

14:12.971 --> 14:15.109
I want you to role
play firing me.

14:15.141 --> 14:17.379
I want you to fire me,
and I will take it.

14:17.412 --> 14:19.416
Oh, you want me
to be you?
Yes.

14:19.450 --> 14:21.789
I want you to be me,
and I will be Creed.

14:21.822 --> 14:23.292
Oh, are you firing Creed?
No, no.

14:23.325 --> 14:27.300
No, that's just first--thing.
Can't--in head.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.503
We should switch seats
in order to...

14:29.537 --> 14:33.312
Yes, that's a good idea.

14:33.345 --> 14:35.282
Excuse me.

14:38.288 --> 14:41.862
I'm really sorry,
but I have to let you go.

14:41.896 --> 14:44.034
And it's purely budgetary.

14:44.066 --> 14:45.501
It's not personal--

14:45.536 --> 14:48.308
I'm gonna kill myself!

14:48.342 --> 14:49.410
Wow.

14:49.444 --> 14:51.281
I'm going to kill myself!

14:51.314 --> 14:52.450
And it's your fault!

14:52.483 --> 14:54.186
That's an overreaction.

14:54.219 --> 14:55.857
Corporate is really
breathing down my neck.

14:55.890 --> 14:57.592
And they're saying
this has to be done

14:57.625 --> 14:59.196
by the end of the month.

14:59.229 --> 15:01.533
Is this you? Are you being you,
or is this Creed?

15:01.568 --> 15:05.542
I--this is Creed.

15:05.575 --> 15:09.049
Okay.
I'm improvising, so just
try to keep up.

15:09.084 --> 15:10.418
And I'm very angry.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.190
Hold that thought.
Creed?

15:12.223 --> 15:14.359
Michael Scott here.
I'm gonna kill you
for firing me.

15:14.394 --> 15:15.629
Toby

15:15.662 --> 15:18.034
I really have to take this,
Creed, so it was really worth--

15:18.068 --> 15:19.905
Get off, get off.
No, no.

15:26.351 --> 15:29.323
Just, just--yeah.

15:30.359 --> 15:32.329
What happened?

15:32.363 --> 15:34.266
It wasn't me.
Oh.

15:34.299 --> 15:35.569
That was, like, crazy.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.408
I know.
'Cause I was--

15:45.288 --> 15:47.927
Uh, hey, Creed?

15:47.962 --> 15:49.263
Huh?

15:49.296 --> 15:51.133
Could I talk to you
for a second?

15:56.044 --> 15:58.347
You are great.

15:58.381 --> 16:00.452
Very ambitious.

16:00.486 --> 16:01.921
And I feel like you want more

16:01.921 --> 16:04.660
than this little office
has to offer.

16:04.693 --> 16:07.333
And I understand that you'd
wanna just spread your wings

16:07.365 --> 16:09.637
and fly the coop.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.308
What are you telling me?

16:11.341 --> 16:14.579
We're gonna have to--
You--you want something better.

16:14.613 --> 16:17.320
No, I don't.
I wanna stay right here.

16:17.353 --> 16:19.356
No, you wanna leave.

16:19.389 --> 16:21.261
No, I wanna stay here.

16:21.293 --> 16:23.132
Why are you making this so hard?

16:23.164 --> 16:25.036
I think there's
a misunderstanding, Michael.

16:25.069 --> 16:26.338
I think you're right.

16:26.370 --> 16:29.210
Can I go?
No, of course, you can't go.

16:29.243 --> 16:33.317
We haven't even started
this horrible process of--

16:33.352 --> 16:35.489
Okay, Creed,

16:35.522 --> 16:40.199
I need to let somebody go today.

16:40.231 --> 16:43.205
They told me I need
to let somebody go.

16:43.237 --> 16:45.441
And as much as I think
you're a great guy,

16:45.475 --> 16:49.383
and I like you,
you're--you're, good-bye.

16:49.416 --> 16:50.786
Let's fight it.

16:50.818 --> 16:52.322
Hmm?

16:52.355 --> 16:53.625
Let's call Jan,
and fight this thing together

16:53.658 --> 16:54.594
like the old days.

16:54.627 --> 16:56.430
What old days?
What are you talking about?

16:56.463 --> 16:58.102
Did you start the paperwork yet?

16:58.135 --> 16:59.704
It's right here
on the desk, yeah.

16:59.737 --> 17:01.308
You don't have to do this,
Michael.

17:01.340 --> 17:03.311
I can't--
Undo it!

17:03.345 --> 17:04.647
I can't change anything.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.451
No, you have the power
to undo it.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.122
You undo it.

17:08.154 --> 17:10.426
Michael, undo it.

17:10.459 --> 17:11.693
Yeah, I went hunting once.

17:11.727 --> 17:13.664
Shot the deer
in the leg.

17:13.697 --> 17:16.571
Had to kill it with a shovel.
Took about an hour.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.772
Why do you ask?

17:17.806 --> 17:19.776
I have to fire
someone today.

17:19.810 --> 17:21.681
Okay?
Fine.

17:21.713 --> 17:25.555
Fire someone else.
Fire Devon, he's terrible.

17:25.589 --> 17:28.494
I am so much better
at my job than Devon.

17:28.527 --> 17:30.498
Okay, well,
I already picked you.

17:30.531 --> 17:31.433
And you know that.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.905
So, unless I just
go through with this,

17:33.937 --> 17:36.843
you're always gonna look at me
as the guy who almost fired you.

17:36.878 --> 17:39.717
No, no, no, no, no.
I will forget so fast.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.288
You will be my savior.

17:41.321 --> 17:44.426
You're the guy who
gave me my life back.

17:44.459 --> 17:46.597
Thank you.

17:46.631 --> 17:48.635
I knew you'd see my way,
Michael, God bless you.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.471
You're a fine man.
Don't...

17:50.505 --> 17:52.343
Listen, you will not regret
this either.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.314
Devon's terrible.
No one's gonna miss him.

17:54.347 --> 17:57.720
Good, good, good.

18:13.617 --> 18:17.493
Devon, could I talk
to you for a sec?

18:17.526 --> 18:19.797
Creed's an idiot.
You know that.
Well, he...

18:19.829 --> 18:22.436
No, no, no, no, no.
You had it right the first time.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.539
Well, maybe I did.
Exactly.

18:24.574 --> 18:26.677
You gotta go
with you gut, man.

18:26.711 --> 18:28.515
Huh. Well...

18:28.547 --> 18:31.321
No, I can't--
No.

18:31.353 --> 18:33.258
I can't go back.
I would look like an idiot.

18:33.292 --> 18:34.927
That's why I'm being fired?
No.

18:34.959 --> 18:36.764
So you might not look
like an idiot?
No.

18:36.798 --> 18:38.634
It was all
the stuff that I said.

18:38.667 --> 18:41.508
It was the business downturn,
the cutbacks, and, and--

18:41.540 --> 18:43.312
This is unbelievable!

18:43.345 --> 18:46.550
I just hope that you
and I can remain friends.

18:48.522 --> 18:51.394
Devon, wait...please.

18:51.428 --> 18:53.631
Look, look.

18:53.664 --> 18:57.572
In addition to severance,
and everything,

18:57.605 --> 19:01.781
I want to give you

19:01.814 --> 19:03.852
this gift certificate
to Chili's.

19:03.885 --> 19:06.491
From me.

19:06.523 --> 19:09.497
Okay? No hard feelings.

19:11.701 --> 19:14.573
Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly,

19:14.607 --> 19:17.044
Toby, Oscar, Meredith,

19:17.077 --> 19:19.550
Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp.

19:19.583 --> 19:21.520
If any of you wanna meet me
for a drink,

19:21.554 --> 19:22.856
I'm gonna be
at Poor Richard's.

19:22.890 --> 19:27.366
And the rest of you
can go to hell.

19:32.475 --> 19:35.748
What about the Halloween party?

19:38.555 --> 19:40.559
Oh, hey, Jim.
Wait, stop.

19:40.591 --> 19:43.664
Um, I'm sorry

19:43.697 --> 19:46.136
for pushing you
toward Cumberland.

19:47.772 --> 19:50.579
Seriously, if you left here,
I would blow my brains out.

19:53.115 --> 19:54.954
Come on.

19:54.987 --> 19:57.493
That's just a figure
of speech, you know?

19:57.526 --> 19:59.127
Blow your brains out?
Come on.

19:59.162 --> 20:01.633
All it really means
is that we're friends.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.638
I mean, who else
is she gonna talk to

20:03.671 --> 20:05.675
if I'm gone, right?

20:05.708 --> 20:08.213
I mean, if she left I wouldn't
blow my brains out.

20:08.247 --> 20:11.085
Of course, I would take
that job in Maryland.

20:11.118 --> 20:12.955
Because it's double the pay,

20:12.990 --> 20:17.130
and soft shell crab just happens
to be my favorite food.

20:23.745 --> 20:25.648
I love Halloween.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.150
You, know it's just--
it's just fun.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.188
Every year, it's just fun.

20:29.221 --> 20:31.994
Last Halloween,
I came as Janet Jackson's boob.

20:33.698 --> 20:35.000
It was topical.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.738
People got a big
kick out of it.

20:36.770 --> 20:39.677
The year before that,
I came as Monica Lewinsky.

20:39.709 --> 20:43.784
And I wore a stained dress.

20:43.817 --> 20:46.089
The year before that,
I also came as Monica Lewinsky.

20:46.122 --> 20:48.528
And before that,
I was O.J.

20:48.562 --> 20:50.265
It was pretty funny.

20:50.297 --> 20:52.134
Oh, I wish you were here
last year.

21:00.619 --> 21:02.522
Trick or treat!

21:02.522 --> 21:04.125
Hey!

21:04.158 --> 21:05.695
How you doin'? Wow!

21:05.729 --> 21:07.130
You guys look great.

21:07.164 --> 21:08.634
I'm a bumblebee.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.738
You look great.

21:10.772 --> 21:12.108
And you're a princess?

21:12.140 --> 21:13.778
A fairy princess.

21:13.811 --> 21:15.782
You're very--
I'm a lion.

21:15.815 --> 21:17.652
You're a lion.
Wow, I want to hear your--

21:17.685 --> 21:19.187
Oh, okay, that's all yours.
That's all yours.

21:19.222 --> 21:20.726
Grab it, grab it.
You know what?

21:20.758 --> 21:22.762
You guys are getting
all of these.
