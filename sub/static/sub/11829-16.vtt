?

00:11.340 --> 00:12.280
??do?

00:12.340 --> 00:13.480
Say I love you?

00:13.520 --> 00:15.410
I don't love anyone.
I don't even love myself.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.550
- Jack Pappas?
- Yeah.

00:17.610 --> 00:18.380
Are you Duncan's,uh-- ?

00:18.420 --> 00:19.860
I'm his sister.

00:19.890 --> 00:21.280
I'm Shawna.

00:21.330 --> 00:23.540
You expecting someone
about this high,huh?

00:23.590 --> 00:25.490
Well,uh,kinda,yeah.

00:25.540 --> 00:26.450
Still want to do this?

00:26.500 --> 00:27.430
Yeah. Let's roll.

00:27.470 --> 00:30.150
Even though you know about me,you'd
still let me go out with Grace?

00:30.200 --> 00:32.400
Yeah. I would.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.870
We love you.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.070
And that's why we want to make sure
that you have the best home possible.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.440
The best family possible.

00:39.490 --> 00:41.090
I'm your mother.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.660
You're my son.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.710
They got him. Your father,
he's been arrested.

00:45.740 --> 00:46.710
For?

00:46.760 --> 00:49.130
Possession of drugs. They got him.

01:05.890 --> 01:06.790
Hello?

01:06.840 --> 01:08.330
Hi,Adrian?

01:09.250 --> 01:11.640
- Grace?
- Yeah. Hi.

01:11.690 --> 01:12.940
Uh,you said that.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.580
I just didn't know if you heard.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.120
Um,Ricky and I aren't
seeing each other anymore.

01:17.150 --> 01:18.250
Oh?

01:18.310 --> 01:19.830
Hey,you must have heard.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.280
You know his father's around?

01:21.340 --> 01:23.770
Well,I heard that. But what
does that have to do with you?

01:23.820 --> 01:25.840
He just doesn't want me to get hurt.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.190
And I met the guy.
He's really creepy.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.190
Yeah,well,he's not around anymore.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.770
He went back to prison.

01:31.820 --> 01:33.220
What?

01:33.600 --> 01:34.760
Are you sure?

01:34.790 --> 01:36.070
I'm sure.

01:36.110 --> 01:37.410
You didn't have to tell her that.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.140
So you're talking to Ricky?

01:39.190 --> 01:40.720
Am I talking to Ricky? No.

01:40.750 --> 01:41.970
Then how'd you know?

01:42.020 --> 01:44.070
Oh. Uh,Jack told me.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.270
He's the one that sent
the guy back to prison.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.710
Uh,he saw him buying drugs,
and called my dad.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.570
Really? His dad was buying drugs?

01:50.620 --> 01:51.730
That's terrible.

01:51.750 --> 01:56.510
Uh,yeah,except it violated his parole
and got him out of Ricky's life.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.850
So maybe you and Ricky  can go out again.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.900
Yeah,maybe we can.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.850
Thank you,Adrian.

02:03.870 --> 02:04.790
You're such a good friend.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.880
I knew I'd feel better
if I called you.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.560
Good night. Oh. Wait.
How are you doing?

02:09.610 --> 02:10.910
I'm fine.

02:10.970 --> 02:12.680
I'm a little lonely.

02:12.730 --> 02:13.920
But fine.

02:13.970 --> 02:15.960
- Good night.
- Night.

02:16.610 --> 02:17.930
Why'd you do that?

02:17.960 --> 02:20.060
What? You're in love with her?

02:20.090 --> 02:21.970
What does that mean,
really? "In love"?

02:22.010 --> 02:25.110
Well,to her,it means
she wants to marry you

02:25.160 --> 02:26.920
and have your babies.

02:26.970 --> 02:28.280
And to you,

02:28.330 --> 02:31.260
being in love means that you
want to have sex with Grace.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.710
And that's all it means.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.740
And I guess since she's
not having sex with you,

02:35.780 --> 02:36.800
you're not in love.

02:36.850 --> 02:38.390
You have to have sex to be in love.

02:38.420 --> 02:41.240
That's not true. We had sex,
I'm not in love with you.

02:41.290 --> 02:42.560
Shut up.

02:43.860 --> 02:46.340
Oh,I bet I know who that is.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.420
Hi,Grace.

02:51.450 --> 02:52.770
Hi,Ricky.

02:53.180 --> 02:55.270
I was just wondering
how you're doing.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.350
I'm fine.

02:56.390 --> 03:00.650
I heard your father
is no longer around.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.840
Well,he's not dead.
He just went back to prison.

03:02.890 --> 03:04.470
Does that mean we can  see each other?

03:04.520 --> 03:05.300
I don't know,Grace.

03:05.350 --> 03:07.620
I'm still kind of dealing
with a lot of stuff.

03:07.670 --> 03:09.410
Maybe I could help you with it.

03:09.460 --> 03:12.270
Did you want to come over
tomorrow and we can just talk?

03:12.300 --> 03:13.060
Anything?

03:13.100 --> 03:14.590
Tomorrow night?

03:14.630 --> 03:16.720
I can't. I have a date with Amy.

03:16.770 --> 03:18.410
We're gonna talk about the baby.

03:18.450 --> 03:20.410
Oh. Okay.Well,

03:20.450 --> 03:22.860
if you want to call me after
you talk to Amy,you can,okay?

03:22.910 --> 03:24.130
Okay. Thanks,Grace.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.221
That's a very nice offer,

03:25.221 --> 03:27.490
especially considering  this past week.

03:27.550 --> 03:28.740
Good night.

03:29.470 --> 03:33.230
?

03:33.260 --> 03:35.590
because that is the last time
you're getting any from me.

03:35.640 --> 03:36.650
I doubt it.

03:36.690 --> 03:37.870
I swear.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.820
I was getting tired of you anyway.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.800
And there are other
places I can go,you know?

03:43.460 --> 03:44.830
Good night.

03:47.970 --> 03:49.300
Goodbye.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.760
Yeah,yeah.

04:13.870 --> 04:16.269
Ricky's going over to  talk to Amy tonight.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.610
So I thought maybe you'd
like to come over for a while.

04:19.649 --> 04:21.488
You know,I haven't seen
you in a long time.

04:21.488 --> 04:22.790
I can't. I'm busy.

04:23.150 --> 04:24.260
What are you doing tonight?

04:24.310 --> 04:25.560
I'm mentoring.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.810
I'm making the world a better
place for humanity.

04:27.850 --> 04:28.950
You really believe that?

04:28.990 --> 04:30.880
That's what the brochure says.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.020
I'm trying to make
myself feel better about

04:33.060 --> 04:34.990
not dating on a Friday night.

04:35.750 --> 04:39.040
Hey,what are Ricky
and Amy talking about?

04:39.090 --> 04:42.430
They're not,like,
getting together,are they?

04:44.300 --> 04:46.160
Amy and Ricky can't
be seeing each other tonight.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.110
My experience with
what normal women do

04:48.150 --> 04:50.070
is limited to Ashley and Alice.

04:50.130 --> 04:52.580
So I don't know if
I'm any help to you here.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.720
She would tell me if Ricky
was coming to see her.

04:54.750 --> 04:55.920
I mean,she would,right?

04:55.970 --> 04:58.350
Yeah,he's going over
there tonight.Ricky told me.

04:58.380 --> 04:59.910
Amy didn't tell you?

05:01.580 --> 05:03.590
Maybe she forgot to tell you.

05:03.620 --> 05:05.500
Or maybe it isn't true.

05:06.220 --> 05:07.310
Hey,guys.

05:07.990 --> 05:09.090
Bye.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.150
What's up?

05:11.190 --> 05:11.910
You tell me.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.200
Tell you what?

05:13.250 --> 05:15.520
People think that Ricky's coming
over to see you tonight.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.430
I was going to tell you.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.040
Yeah,he's coming over to talk.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.660
When were you gonna tell me?

05:19.690 --> 05:20.290
Right now.

05:20.330 --> 05:21.760
How long have you known about this?

05:21.810 --> 05:23.290
A couple of days.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.740
Oh,very mature.

05:25.790 --> 05:27.540
Oh,yeah. Like you're mature.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.730
Marriage sucks,huh?

05:31.760 --> 05:33.370
Can we talk in your office?

05:38.580 --> 05:39.860
I just found out that Ricky and Amy

05:39.900 --> 05:42.170
are seeing each other to
talk about the baby tonight.

05:42.210 --> 05:42.810
And?

05:42.850 --> 05:44.770
And I knew nothing about this.

05:44.820 --> 05:46.630
I just,I don't want
him anywhere near her.

05:46.660 --> 05:48.230
Well,that's his baby.

05:48.270 --> 05:49.400
No,that's her baby.

05:49.460 --> 05:50.670
Their baby.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.200
I mean,don't you think
I should be included?

05:53.230 --> 05:54.690
That I should have some say in this?

05:54.740 --> 05:56.100
You're not really married.

05:56.150 --> 05:58.270
I'm more of a father
to that baby than he is.

05:58.310 --> 05:59.660
And so it begins.

05:59.710 --> 06:00.420
So what begins?

06:00.480 --> 06:01.430
Fighting over the kid.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.940
- You know what?
- No,what?

06:02.990 --> 06:05.320
This is actually where you
could be really helpful.

06:06.230 --> 06:08.880
Okay,So you call in Amy and Ricky,

06:08.930 --> 06:10.650
oh,and me of course,into the office.

06:10.700 --> 06:14.400
And then you mediate whatever
discussion needs to be had at this point.

06:14.450 --> 06:16.370
And what makes you think
that's part of my job?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.150
You're a counselor. Counsel us.

06:18.190 --> 06:20.440
I'm not a family counselor.
I'm a student counselor.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.450
We're students.

06:21.490 --> 06:22.930
This is not about being students,

06:22.970 --> 06:26.260
this is about being......not students.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.600
I could help with getting
a tutor,selecting a college,

06:29.640 --> 06:30.950
extracurricular activities.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.000
This is all about
an extracurricular activity.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.090
It's not what I do.

06:35.130 --> 06:36.210
No,it is what you do.

06:36.250 --> 06:38.950
You're the one who got me involved
with Amy in the first place.

06:39.010 --> 06:40.010
I am not.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.490
You told me to call her.

06:41.540 --> 06:44.650
Face it,counselor,you're in
way too deep to back out now.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.980
This is better anyway.
Uh,you're a neutral party.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.850
With leanings toward me.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.830
You know,because we have history.
We go back.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.370
I know you,you know me.

06:52.410 --> 06:55.430
Then you know,I should not be
giving anyone relationship advice.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.490
How's the missus?

06:56.540 --> 06:58.490
She's good.Thank you for asking.

06:59.020 --> 07:00.540
So's her mother.

07:00.590 --> 07:02.910
The two of them are
looking for a house today.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.290
For the three of us.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.470
That's cozy.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.180
What happened to me?

07:09.140 --> 07:10.490
I could've had class.

07:10.540 --> 07:12.680
I could've been a contender.
I could have been somebody.

07:13.310 --> 07:15.280
Instead of a bum,
which is what I am,

07:15.320 --> 07:16.720
let's face it.

07:17.010 --> 07:18.310
It was you,Ben.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.250
That'sOn the Waterfront?  Brando,right?

07:20.290 --> 07:22.320
You came in here your
first week of school

07:22.360 --> 07:23.780
with your personal problems.

07:23.830 --> 07:25.590
And I made the mistake
of trying to help you.

07:25.630 --> 07:29.290
And now you're married and
having a custody battle at 15?

07:29.330 --> 07:31.550
I'm not cut out for this.
I'm a cop.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.340
My girlfriend,now wife,

07:33.380 --> 07:35.920
made me quit the force because
it was interfering with our lives.

07:35.970 --> 07:38.120
You're not a narc,are you?

07:38.160 --> 07:41.150
A what? No. I'm just a cop.

07:41.190 --> 07:44.180
With teaching credentials
and a background in psychology.

07:44.940 --> 07:46.720
I had a hard time choosing a major.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.700
All I ever wanted to
do was help people.

07:48.750 --> 07:51.140
But you know what?
Helping people doesn't pay.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.440
And I'm no good at it.

07:52.470 --> 07:56.820
And I have the exact same flaw that gets
people into trouble in the first place.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.360
I can't say no.

07:58.390 --> 08:01.770
So could you get Amy and Ricky
and me together for a meeting?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.300
You wanted to see me?

08:21.830 --> 08:23.530
I'm in the wrong business.

08:25.860 --> 08:26.740
Ricky.

08:26.790 --> 08:29.070
Did you try to drag Molina
into my personal business?

08:29.120 --> 08:31.700
Um,yeah. You know,
I thought it was a good idea.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.780
The three of us meeting in a neutral
setting with a professional mediator.

08:34.820 --> 08:37.179
I know what there is
to mediate between Amy and me.

08:37.210 --> 08:39.370
But what's there to mediate
between Amy and me and you?

08:39.400 --> 08:41.850
It's not my baby,but she is my Amy.

08:41.890 --> 08:43.929
And I love her,and I love that baby.

08:43.980 --> 08:46.330
And I-I want to be part of
the decision-making process.

08:46.370 --> 08:48.350
So come on over to Amy's tonight.

08:48.390 --> 08:49.740
What?

08:49.780 --> 08:50.780
I wasn't invited.

08:50.820 --> 08:51.840
Well,I'm inviting you.

08:51.870 --> 08:53.880
I don't think Amy would
like that very much.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.250
No? What would you like to do,Ben?

08:56.300 --> 08:57.660
Would you like to be
over at Amy's house

08:57.710 --> 08:59.260
when I go over there  to talk to her?

08:59.300 --> 09:01.560
If that's what you want to do,
then you should do it.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.650
You gonna let Amy make all the decisions
for you for the rest of your life?

09:04.710 --> 09:07.130
That's a long time not
to have what you want.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.900
Just ask Mr. Molina.

09:21.040 --> 09:21.680
What?

09:21.740 --> 09:25.170
I'm hoping to wrap up this conversation
with Amy around 10,at the latest.

09:25.210 --> 09:26.410
What do I care?

09:26.460 --> 09:27.370
You care.

09:27.410 --> 09:28.470
No,I don't.

09:28.510 --> 09:30.600
Especially not since we're
not having sex anymore.

09:31.140 --> 09:32.320
Ah. You don't mean that.

09:32.350 --> 09:34.170
I mean that. I have to go.

09:34.220 --> 09:35.360
Where you going?

09:35.390 --> 09:36.590
A guy's coming over.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.360
What guy?

09:37.400 --> 09:38.940
Wouldn't you like to know?

09:38.990 --> 09:40.150
No.

09:40.200 --> 09:40.830
I have to go.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.800
Wait a minute. What guy? Jack?

09:42.850 --> 09:44.180
No. Not Jack.

09:44.210 --> 09:47.210
Jack is making the world a
better place for humanity.

09:47.260 --> 09:49.000
He doesn't have time to come over.

09:49.740 --> 09:50.560
I have to go.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.830
Fine. Good night.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.040
Adrian?

09:57.080 --> 09:58.280
Max?

09:59.260 --> 10:00.510
Come on in.

10:07.770 --> 10:08.880
So,what'd you want to talk about?

10:08.900 --> 10:10.400
Your dad leaving my mom.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.980
Yeah. It seems that's
a possibility anyway.

10:13.010 --> 10:14.600
Well,I had no idea.

10:14.630 --> 10:16.990
It's not because of me,right?

10:24.200 --> 10:25.470
Ah. Ricky. Oh.

10:28.070 --> 10:28.710
Hello?

10:28.750 --> 10:30.580
- Hi,Grace.
- Hi,Ricky.

10:30.610 --> 10:31.640
Did you want to come over?

10:31.690 --> 10:34.200
My parents took Tom
and Tammy out.So no one's home.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.490
But that's okay,
because they trust you and me.

10:36.530 --> 10:38.210
So you can come over if you want.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.960
I can't. I have to go over to Amy's.

10:40.010 --> 10:41.210
Oh,you're still going?

10:41.270 --> 10:42.090
Yeah.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.850
Well,tell Amy I say hello. If you want.

10:44.910 --> 10:45.930
Yeah,I will.

10:45.970 --> 10:49.420
So you were just calling to tell
me you're still going to Amy's?

10:49.490 --> 10:50.840
I was just feeling a little anxious.

10:50.870 --> 10:52.600
I thought I'd ask you to pray for me.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.770
Yeah,of course.

10:53.810 --> 10:56.390
And if it's not too late,
maybe I could come over afterwards.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.620
It won't be too late,
no matter what time it is.

10:58.650 --> 11:00.310
No,if you wanna talk,come on over.

11:00.340 --> 11:02.530
All right,well,I'll call you first.

11:02.570 --> 11:04.880
Okay. Oh,and I'll bake you cookies.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.370
Chocolate chip? You like those?

11:06.410 --> 11:07.420
Yeah. Thanks.

11:07.470 --> 11:08.300
I'll see you later.

11:08.350 --> 11:09.460
All right. Bye,Grace.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.640
Bye.

11:14.860 --> 11:16.890
I don't know what's keeping him.

11:17.530 --> 11:20.160
Other than he did have to take
the bus home from his job.

11:20.210 --> 11:21.540
Oh,I didn't know he had a job.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.940
Uh,we don't have parents. Heh-heh.

11:24.490 --> 11:25.690
He has to have a job.

11:25.740 --> 11:26.990
Yeah,he didn't mention it.

11:27.030 --> 11:28.610
It's because he thinks it's stupid.

11:28.650 --> 11:29.650
What's his job?

11:29.690 --> 11:31.380
- He bags groceries.
- That's not stupid.

11:31.430 --> 11:33.630
No. He doesn't make a lot,

11:33.670 --> 11:34.930
but every little bit helps.

11:34.970 --> 11:36.250
Yeah.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.540
It's him.

11:41.310 --> 11:42.630
Where are you?

11:44.270 --> 11:45.310
All right.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.020
Yeah,he's here. I'll tell him.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.060
They asked him to work extra hours.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.650
So you can go if you want,

11:55.020 --> 11:57.470
or I can entertain
you until he gets home.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.570
I mean,I don't have
any place I have to be.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.840
Good.

12:01.830 --> 12:05.350
So,uh,entertain me.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.000
So,what are you wearing?

12:13.050 --> 12:15.020
I don't know.
It doesn't make any difference.

12:15.050 --> 12:16.860
It's not like
I'm dressing up for Ricky.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.760
I'm just trying
to find something comfortable.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.480
Everything's getting
so uncomfortable.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.130
So you're looking for comfort?

12:23.170 --> 12:23.940
Yes.

12:23.980 --> 12:25.240
You're not dressing up for Ricky?

12:25.290 --> 12:26.230
No.

12:26.270 --> 12:27.440
Ashley,what's your point?

12:27.490 --> 12:30.720
My point is,is I hope you don't
make the same mistake twice.

12:30.770 --> 12:32.460
Not that you could exactly.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.770
What is wrong with you?

12:33.810 --> 12:36.690
What is wrong with you and Ben?
I'm not interested in Ricky.

12:36.740 --> 12:39.290
I don't want to talk to him.
I have to talk to him.

12:39.340 --> 12:40.580
He has to go along with the adoption

12:40.610 --> 12:42.640
or there's no sense
in even interviewing couples.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.010
If he doesn't go along with it?

12:44.050 --> 12:46.150
I'll just drop out of school,
get a full-time job,

12:46.200 --> 12:48.460
put the baby in daycare,
and embrace teen motherhood.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.440
Sound good to you?

12:49.490 --> 12:50.630
You're so dramatic.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.870
I'm pregnant. I'm 15.

12:52.910 --> 12:54.160
You're pregnant and you're 15.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.110
You're not the only pregnant teenager.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.660
Stop feeling so sorry for yourself.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.180
I am not feeling sorry for myself!

13:00.220 --> 13:02.970
I'm doing the responsible
thing by trying to find two adults

13:03.010 --> 13:05.750
who can provide my baby with
a stable home and loving family.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.480
If you'd done the responsible
thing six months ago...

13:09.270 --> 13:10.680
Whoa,whoa! The baby. Be careful.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.790
I do not feel sorry for myself!

13:12.830 --> 13:13.780
I'm trying to do the right thing.

13:13.830 --> 13:17.220
And in trying,I have to get
the baby's father's permission.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.030
So I am forced to talk to Ricky.

13:19.070 --> 13:21.710
But you're not forced to  talk to Ricky alone,Amy.

13:24.390 --> 13:25.750
Help me up.

13:31.710 --> 13:34.260
Come on,Amy. You know you're
a little interested in Ricky.

13:34.310 --> 13:36.710
No,I'm not.

13:47.540 --> 13:50.390
You're all dressed up for Ricky?
And making him appetizers?

13:50.430 --> 13:53.280
Yes,because I too
want to have his baby.

13:54.170 --> 13:55.500
I'm going out.

13:55.540 --> 13:56.870
I'm just making snacks for Amy.

13:56.910 --> 13:58.620
Going out? You can't go out.

13:58.660 --> 14:01.040
You're not the boss of me,George.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.480
We're getting a divorce,rember?

14:02.520 --> 14:04.370
You can't go out with
Ricky coming over.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.650
And why not?

14:05.680 --> 14:06.710
What do you mean,why not?

14:06.760 --> 14:09.310
It's not like they're gonna
have sex and get pregnant.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.080
Besides,you'll be in the garage.

14:11.130 --> 14:12.810
Uh-uh. I have plans.

14:12.840 --> 14:13.810
To do what?

14:13.860 --> 14:16.420
You're not the boss of me either.
I don't have to tell you my plans.

14:16.460 --> 14:17.550
You don't have plans.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.870
Yes,I do.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.840
I'm going over to Donovan's.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.700
Really?

14:21.730 --> 14:24.520
After he's worked for you
for so long? That's a first.

14:25.060 --> 14:26.240
Is Leon gonna be there?

14:26.270 --> 14:27.600
Who's Leon?

14:27.650 --> 14:29.650
His partner of 10 years.

14:29.690 --> 14:30.960
They consider themselves married.

14:31.010 --> 14:32.860
Yeah. Yeah,he's gonna be there.

14:32.910 --> 14:34.640
Are they setting you
up on a blind date?

14:34.680 --> 14:37.030
I'm married. To what's-her-name? You.

14:37.060 --> 14:38.000
You can date.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.060
Are you going out on a date?

14:39.090 --> 14:40.700
I'm just meeting someone for a drink.

14:40.740 --> 14:41.680
That's a date.

14:41.710 --> 14:42.820
It's Reverend Stone.

14:42.860 --> 14:44.050
You're dating Reverend Stone?

14:44.090 --> 14:45.820
There's a match made in Hades. Ha-ha.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.040
No,he just wants to meet
to talk about couples

14:48.090 --> 14:49.900
who are interested in
adopting Amy's baby.

14:49.950 --> 14:51.020
You're going ahead with this?

14:51.060 --> 14:52.510
Yeah,if it's what they want.

14:52.550 --> 14:53.840
Let's leave it up to those two,

14:53.870 --> 14:56.060
because they've been making
excellent decisions.

14:56.090 --> 14:57.530
I'm out of here.

15:01.940 --> 15:03.010
Oh,thanks.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.870
So who's the makeup for?

15:06.900 --> 15:08.550
Oh,God,it's not for Ricky,is it?

15:08.590 --> 15:09.960
It's for Reverend Stone.

15:10.020 --> 15:11.820
Huh. I thought he was happily married.

15:11.860 --> 15:13.550
We're meeting to talk about couples.

15:13.590 --> 15:15.150
You know,for Amy's baby.

15:15.210 --> 15:16.830
Amy wants me to meet with him first,

15:16.860 --> 15:18.400
then she and Ricky will meet.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.280
You mean,if he agrees to the adoption?

15:20.310 --> 15:21.490
Yeah,if he agrees.

15:21.530 --> 15:23.890
So I'm chaperoning?

15:23.940 --> 15:25.570
Well,that's very kind of you to offer,

15:25.620 --> 15:26.970
but I think that they'll be fine.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.520
And if she tries to kill him,
I should just call 911?

15:29.570 --> 15:30.700
She's won't try to kill him.

15:30.750 --> 15:31.920
She just jumped me.

15:31.960 --> 15:32.990
Because?

15:33.020 --> 15:34.930
Because I vote no on the adoption.

15:34.990 --> 15:38.210
Ashley,you need to be supportive of Amy.

15:38.260 --> 15:41.000
If Amy decides she wants the
baby adopted,that's her decision.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.780
- It's her life.
- It's my nephew.

15:44.190 --> 15:46.450
Tell your sister that
the appetizers are ready,okay?

15:51.220 --> 15:52.760
Oh. Hi,Ben.

15:52.790 --> 15:53.990
Hi.

15:54.060 --> 15:56.350
Uh,does Amy know that
you're coming over?

15:56.390 --> 15:57.650
Uh,I don't think so.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.730
Because tonight--

15:58.760 --> 16:00.010
Ricky's coming over? I know.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.250
I just came by to
offer her my support.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.920
Oh. Well,great. Come on in.

16:06.770 --> 16:07.770
Bye.

16:11.290 --> 16:12.400
Run.

16:13.470 --> 16:14.970
Amy?

16:15.020 --> 16:16.280
- Ben?
- Please.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.840
What are you doing here?

16:17.880 --> 16:18.490
I'm coming.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.120
Let me stay.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.160
Please let me stay.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.420
Don't beg.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.110
I told him he could come.

16:27.150 --> 16:28.930
What? I don't care if he's here.

16:28.970 --> 16:31.360
I don't care if all your
friends and family are here.

16:31.410 --> 16:33.990
I'm not gonna change my mind.
I don't want the baby adopted.

16:34.020 --> 16:35.240
Fine.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.790
Then it's yours.

16:46.510 --> 16:48.210
I'd take the baby,

16:48.240 --> 16:50.560
but,uh,can I do that legally?

16:50.590 --> 16:51.830
Yes,you can.

16:51.870 --> 16:54.500
But,how's he gonna
take care of the baby?

16:54.540 --> 16:56.850
The same way I was gonna
take care of the baby.

16:57.260 --> 16:59.410
Drop out of school and
get a job,and get daycare.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.590
I'm not gonna do that.

17:00.630 --> 17:02.780
Really? What are you gonna do?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.250
Have you really
thought this through?

17:06.060 --> 17:10.040
No. The idea just
occurred to me. But I like it.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.750
This way,Ben and I can continue
to be in the band

17:13.790 --> 17:17.089
and go to school dances,and do all
the stuff normal high school students do.

17:17.140 --> 17:20.109
Go to college and have a career,
while you raise your son.

17:22.180 --> 17:23.130
Did you know?

17:23.150 --> 17:25.380
No,I didn't know.

17:25.410 --> 17:26.859
- A boy?
- Yes.

17:26.910 --> 17:29.530
So he's probably better off
with you than me anyways.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.440
Although the best home for him
would be with two adults.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.410
I don't know.

17:34.450 --> 17:35.840
Uh,yeah.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.840
Well,why don't you two talk it over

17:37.880 --> 17:40.270
and decide and let me know
what I should do.

17:45.270 --> 17:46.860
We already knew about you,you kno

17:46.900 --> 17:48.980
He told my mom a long time ago.

17:49.030 --> 17:51.690
We just didn't think you'd
show up out of nowhere.

17:52.220 --> 17:54.300
Yeah,it was kind of spur
of the moment.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.830
You never wanted to know who
your father is before now?

17:57.410 --> 17:58.580
Not really.

17:58.610 --> 17:59.770
Well,why now?

17:59.810 --> 18:01.250
Why not now?

18:01.860 --> 18:02.730
You need money?

18:03.880 --> 18:05.220
Not really,no.

18:05.260 --> 18:06.980
Mm,my mom does okay.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.210
She's really good with
what money we have.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.950
She's already got my
college paid for.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.030
College,huh?

18:13.200 --> 18:14.630
Yeah.

18:14.670 --> 18:16.450
You just don't look like
the college type.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.350
Looks are deceiving.

18:18.410 --> 18:20.390
Does your mother look like you?

18:21.800 --> 18:23.870
I look more like my father,
don't you think?

18:23.910 --> 18:24.770
No.

18:24.790 --> 18:25.750
What's your father like?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.340
He's military. Career military.

18:28.370 --> 18:30.180
My mother got tired of moving around.

18:30.230 --> 18:31.900
And tired of him cheating on her.

18:31.940 --> 18:33.900
So I'm just trying to do some
recon for her.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.100
She thinks your dad and mom
are gonna get together.

18:36.130 --> 18:40.000
Well,you don't have to
worry about that.

18:40.030 --> 18:42.070
Um,my mom's not interested
in settling down.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.130
She's a-- She's a very
independent woman.

18:45.170 --> 18:46.290
She's never been married.

18:46.330 --> 18:50.280
Besides,Ruben's a little too
tightly wound for her.

18:50.740 --> 18:54.300
But,anyways,um,enough
about our parents.

18:54.770 --> 18:57.280
Let's,uh,talk about you.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.520
What do you like to do?

18:58.560 --> 19:01.690
I like to take long walks on
the beach in the moonlight,

19:01.730 --> 19:03.280
and make love in the sand.

19:04.380 --> 19:05.370
I'm just kidding.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.040
We're not taking walks on the beach.
You're like my sister.

19:08.070 --> 19:09.330
No,I'm not.

19:09.780 --> 19:10.680
We're not related.

19:10.730 --> 19:11.830
Your my stepsister.

19:11.870 --> 19:15.470
Stop saying sister,stepsister,
anything sister,okay?

19:15.500 --> 19:18.080
You're making me feel icky
for being attracted to you.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.350
And I am attracted to you.

19:22.190 --> 19:23.530
Are you attracted to me?

19:23.580 --> 19:25.800
We're not attracted to each other.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.090
We can't be.

19:27.130 --> 19:27.680
Why not?

19:27.720 --> 19:30.460
Because we can't. I'm not gonna
have sex with my own sister.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.370
I told you,I'm not your sister.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.950
We're not related.

19:35.640 --> 19:39.140
Heh. And don't get ahead
of yourself. I'm not that easy.

19:39.160 --> 19:42.520
If you want this,you're
gonna have to work for it.

19:47.410 --> 19:48.870
Work harder.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.070
This is so good. What is it?

19:57.120 --> 19:59.370
That's Leon's specialty.
Chicken Ã©touffÃ©e.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.290
It's delicious.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.840
Thank you. I love to cook.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.240
Hm. I love to eat.

20:03.290 --> 20:07.010
Good,because I made a triple-layer
chocolate cake with caramel icing.

20:07.040 --> 20:07.970
Get out.

20:08.020 --> 20:10.200
Yes,he did. It took him all afternoon.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.310
You guys are such great cooks.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.040
Man,who wouldn't wanna live here?

20:13.070 --> 20:14.130
You gays.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.070
Oh. I'm sorry,Leon,
maybe I shouldn't make assumptions.

20:18.110 --> 20:20.900
Are you,uh,you know,out?

20:20.940 --> 20:21.640
Way out.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.990
Yeah,I thought so.

20:23.030 --> 20:26.020
You know,George,not all gay
men are good cooks.

20:26.060 --> 20:26.970
But Leon is.

20:27.010 --> 20:28.110
I'll say.

20:28.140 --> 20:29.290
Are you ready for dessert?

20:29.320 --> 20:31.180
Or another helping
of that Ã©touffÃ©e?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.850
Don't fill up on the Ã©touffÃ©e.

20:32.890 --> 20:35.030
You have to have some
of Donovan's cake.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.780
You can take the leftovers home.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.140
I'm not going anywhere.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.610
Give me 10 minutes,I'll be ready
for the second round.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.010
We ordered the fight
on pay-per-view tonight.

20:43.070 --> 20:44.580
You do like boxing,right?

20:44.620 --> 20:45.580
Marry me.

20:47.850 --> 20:50.830
I do know several couples at
the church who are looking to adopt

20:50.870 --> 20:52.740
that I think you should meet.
You and Amy.

20:52.790 --> 20:54.600
Should Ricky be involved
in the meetings?

20:54.640 --> 20:56.040
I'd wait.

20:56.070 --> 20:57.730
First impressions
are very important.

20:57.770 --> 21:00.170
And I'd save Ricky for
later in the process.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.800
Okay. Well,tell me about these couples.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.660
Well,I'm not saying they're right,
I'm just saying they're looking.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.210
There' s the Lavenders.

21:08.250 --> 21:11.930
They've been married almost 30 years.

21:11.960 --> 21:12.720
How old are they?

21:12.760 --> 21:15.610
Older than most,but ready.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.220
Uh,they've spent a lot of
the time seeing the world.

21:18.270 --> 21:20.600
They didn't want to settle
right down and have children.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.800
But,uh,the world's quite
a big place,you know?

21:23.850 --> 21:26.340
Sure,Mr. Lavender may be
a little too old

21:26.400 --> 21:28.010
to play baseball with his son.

21:28.050 --> 21:30.290
But,uh,he has season tickets.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.810
On the third-base line. Box seats.

21:33.850 --> 21:34.930
That counts for something.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.100
Yeah,I guess. Maybe.

21:37.150 --> 21:38.990
And then there are the Carpenters.

21:39.020 --> 21:40.250
Oh,they 're fun.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.710
We get a big kick out of
them at church gatherings.

21:42.750 --> 21:46.260
They are,uh,expert karaoke singers.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.390
And he's quite the didgeridoo player.

21:49.420 --> 21:51.400
The Lavenders sent that back

21:51.420 --> 21:55.620
when they were down under,
hanging with the Aborigines.

21:56.140 --> 21:59.010
The lung capacity of
this man is incredible.

22:00.090 --> 22:02.610
The world is full of such
interesting people.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.370
So the Lavenders and
the Carpenters are friends?

22:05.410 --> 22:07.440
Well,not really close.

22:07.470 --> 22:09.780
The Lavenders just knew
that the Carpenters

22:09.820 --> 22:11.520
were looking for a didgeridoo.

22:14.210 --> 22:16.010
So is there anyone else?

22:16.060 --> 22:20.170
yes,the,uh,Buckners.
They're a little young.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.110
How young?

22:21.150 --> 22:22.050
Twenty-seven.

22:22.090 --> 22:23.570
Oh,that's not so young.

22:23.610 --> 22:24.490
No?

22:24.520 --> 22:26.660
No,it's 12 years older than Amy.

22:26.700 --> 22:29.440
Yeah,well,they,uh-- They've been
married seven years.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.370
Uh,they got married
in college on a whim.

22:32.420 --> 22:33.880
Not unlike you and George.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.420
He's a professional wrestler

22:35.460 --> 22:38.120
and apparently suffers from
some sort of injury.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.640
But the thighs on this man,

22:40.210 --> 22:42.050
I mean,are like tree trunks.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.900
And,uh,she's just a little wisp of a gal.

22:44.950 --> 22:46.590
So,you know,that may be the problem.

22:46.630 --> 22:49.070
His tree trunks or her wispiness?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.800
Are you against the adoption?

22:52.830 --> 22:54.950
Well,I'm not against
adoption in general.

22:55.460 --> 22:56.910
It's just that,um...

22:58.620 --> 23:00.810
Um,maybe there's something
we should talk about here.

23:00.860 --> 23:01.760
Okay.

23:01.810 --> 23:02.700
I have to make a confession,

23:02.750 --> 23:06.610
I promised Ashley that
I'd speak to you and George

23:06.650 --> 23:09.480
about reconsidering your divorce.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.450
What?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.180
I don't want to pursue an adoption

23:12.230 --> 23:14.290
if you two are gonna get together

23:14.340 --> 23:16.620
and the family's gonna remain intact.

23:16.660 --> 23:19.140
Because then you might feel
like you wanna keep the baby.

23:19.170 --> 23:21.040
But we're getting a divorce.

23:21.080 --> 23:21.990
Are you sure?

23:22.030 --> 23:23.800
I'm absolutely sure.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.390
I couldn't be surer.

23:25.430 --> 23:27.300
I will seek a couple in earnest then.

23:27.340 --> 23:28.480
Thanks.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.740
You're welcome.

23:29.780 --> 23:31.860
I can't take the baby,
I'm in foster care.

23:31.890 --> 23:33.410
I didn't even know if that's allowed.

23:33.450 --> 23:35.290
And I don't have time for a baby.

23:35.330 --> 23:38.520
Yeah,but it's better you than some
couple we don't even know.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.230
I mean,at least if it were you,
Amy and I,we could help.

23:41.260 --> 23:42.790
We could babys it on the weekends,

23:42.810 --> 23:44.570
so you could still go out.

23:44.610 --> 23:45.850
Just on weekends?

23:45.890 --> 23:46.860
I don't think so.

23:46.890 --> 23:48.230
You and Amy should keep the baby.

23:48.270 --> 23:50.660
Legally,there is no me and Amy.

23:50.690 --> 23:53.430
Unfortunately. Or else we
would take the baby.

23:53.480 --> 23:56.100
Yeah,you're conveniently
married when you wanna be,

23:56.130 --> 23:58.320
and then you're not married
when you don't wanna be.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.000
Like when you don't want the baby.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.210
I want the baby.

24:01.250 --> 24:02.780
- But--
- But what?

24:03.600 --> 24:05.100
It is your baby.

24:05.140 --> 24:06.970
No,no,no,it's Amy's baby.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.660
I'm the father, but she's having the baby,

24:08.710 --> 24:10.860
so the burden of
responsibility is on her.

24:10.900 --> 24:13.090
Well,I think that Amy has
decided not to accept

24:13.120 --> 24:16.230
this responsibility that's
been thrust upon her.

24:16.260 --> 24:17.650
Pardon the expression.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.990
So now it's your responsibility.

24:20.020 --> 24:21.810
Look,I didn't thrust
anything on anyone.

24:21.850 --> 24:24.610
That's ridiculous. I can only
handle so much responsibility.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.000
I think we all know that.

24:26.050 --> 24:29.070
I'm beginning to see how
Amy landed on adoption.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.680
Yeah.

24:30.740 --> 24:31.490
Still--

24:31.530 --> 24:33.730
Still,she could keep
the baby if she wanted to.

24:33.780 --> 24:35.100
In her defense,

24:35.140 --> 24:37.020
I think that she wants to,

24:37.060 --> 24:39.490
but she can't.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.670
What do you want to do?

24:40.710 --> 24:42.120
You've made yourself a part of this.

24:42.150 --> 24:42.950
I don't know.

24:42.990 --> 24:44.670
You don't know? Why'd you come here?

24:44.700 --> 24:46.180
Because you invited me,ha.

24:46.220 --> 24:48.790
I invited you because you didn't
have the nerve to just show up.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.740
No,it's not a matter of nerves.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.820
It's a matter of consideration.

24:52.860 --> 24:54.750
I'm considerate of Amy's wishes.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.650
Oh,really,Mr. Considerate?

24:56.730 --> 24:58.850
You're here against
her wishes,aren't you?

24:58.930 --> 25:01.550
Yeah,and it's because
I'm jealous of you.

25:03.190 --> 25:06.710
There. Revel in it.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.280
You're jealous of me?

25:08.820 --> 25:11.100
I got news for you,
I'm jealous of you.

25:11.140 --> 25:13.670
Because you've got a choice. I don't.

25:13.710 --> 25:14.890
You don't have to stay around.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.200
You don't have
to take care of the baby.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.690
You don't have to have
discussions with Amy.

25:18.730 --> 25:19.890
But I do.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.890
And my advice to you would
be to get out.

25:21.930 --> 25:24.620
You're 15,Ben,this is your
first girlfriend.

25:24.660 --> 25:26.390
You actually don't want to
go out with any other girl

25:26.440 --> 25:27.760
for the rest of your life?

25:27.790 --> 25:30.100
And what happens if she breaks
up with you for me?

25:30.140 --> 25:31.570
Or for some other guy?

25:31.610 --> 25:32.820
I mean,after all,she didn't tell you

25:32.870 --> 25:34.710
we were getting together tonight.

25:34.740 --> 25:37.740
And you know,deep down inside,
that means something.

25:38.570 --> 25:39.550
She's the one who called me.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.940
You know,I didn't call her
and ask to come over here.

25:41.980 --> 25:44.530
Just like I didn't ask her
out for coffee at band camp.

25:45.030 --> 25:46.440
She asked me.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.190
Where's Ricky?

26:01.620 --> 26:03.180
he went home.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.830
What did the two of you decide?

26:05.860 --> 26:07.420
Well,I guess it's--

26:07.460 --> 26:09.920
It's not about Ricky and me.
It's about Ricky and you.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.010
Oh,do you think so?

26:12.060 --> 26:15.280
Listen,I was talking to
Mr. Molina today--

26:15.330 --> 26:16.690
Oh,jeez.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.460
It got me thinking.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.210
You and Ricky are always gonna
be tied together by this baby,

26:21.250 --> 26:24.920
and that's a pretty strong
tie. Heh,a baby.

26:26.330 --> 26:28.070
And maybe at some point,

26:28.830 --> 26:31.340
you and Ricky will want
to get together.

26:31.370 --> 26:32.300
What?

26:32.330 --> 26:34.830
Amy,as much as I wanna be
the father to your baby,

26:34.870 --> 26:36.110
that's not my baby.

26:36.150 --> 26:38.590
I should have no say in whether
or not the baby's adopted.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.580
That's for you and Ricky to decide.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.160
Maybe I should just
back off for a while,

26:46.210 --> 26:47.210
give you some space,

26:47.260 --> 26:50.950
and let you talk to Ricky without me
giving you a hard time about it,

26:50.980 --> 26:52.740
because you need to talk to Ricky.

26:52.790 --> 26:54.190
And I realize that  if you keep this baby,

26:54.230 --> 26:56.760
you're gonna need to talk to
Ricky throughout the baby's life.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.790
And I think I can handle that,but--

26:59.710 --> 27:02.180
You're gonna have to be
completely honest with me.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.510
And I don't think you were
completely honest with me about

27:04.550 --> 27:07.160
Ricky coming over
to talk tonight,so...

27:07.200 --> 27:08.920
I should be going.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.440
Ben.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.190
Good night,Amy.

27:21.950 --> 27:25.200
I'm sure whatever you decide will
be the right thing to do.

27:33.390 --> 27:34.670
I love you.

27:34.710 --> 27:36.460
I love you too.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.480
It's tough.

27:47.150 --> 27:48.560
I want to be a father to my son,

27:48.590 --> 27:51.480
but let's face it,I may not be
the best guy to parent a kid.

27:51.510 --> 27:53.220
No,I think you'd be a good father.

27:53.260 --> 27:54.560
You have such a good heart.

27:55.290 --> 27:57.600
I don't think that's enough
when it comes to being a parent.

27:57.640 --> 27:58.690
I'm not ready.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.920
I need to finish school.
I need to have a job.

28:01.650 --> 28:04.370
Being a good parent's also
being a good provider.

28:04.410 --> 28:05.990
What could I provide?

28:06.040 --> 28:08.520
Besides,I've still got a lot
of issues to work through.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.290
A lot.

28:10.330 --> 28:11.620
You'll get there.

28:11.660 --> 28:12.940
I just wish that while
I'm getting there

28:12.990 --> 28:15.340
that Amy could keep the baby.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.570
It's a boy. Can you believe that?

28:17.610 --> 28:19.810
Yeah,a boy,we're having a boy.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.350
And then we're giving him away

28:21.390 --> 28:23.830
to two responsible adults
to take care of him.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.330
I don't know.

28:26.370 --> 28:29.880
It doesn't seem right,and yet
neither Amy or I are fit parents.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.980
Do you talk about it in therapy?

28:32.030 --> 28:33.360
I've been avoiding therapy.

28:33.390 --> 28:34.240
Why's that?

28:34.690 --> 28:36.250
Ah,it's too much work lately.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.960
I don't wanna remember things.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.270
I wanna forget.

28:39.330 --> 28:40.480
But can you?

28:40.520 --> 28:42.570
Can you ever really just forget
everything that happened?

28:42.610 --> 28:43.920
When I'm with you,I can.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.320
That's why I love being with you.

28:45.350 --> 28:48.600
The hours that we spend together
take me away from all the pain I'm in.

28:48.630 --> 28:49.770
You're really special,Grace.

28:49.820 --> 28:51.510
I just wish I was good enough for you.

28:51.550 --> 28:52.360
Don't say that.

28:52.410 --> 28:54.900
Oh,come on,you know my story.

28:54.930 --> 28:58.240
I don't know if things could ever
really work out for you and me.

28:58.620 --> 29:01.150
Could you ever see us
married with a couple of kids?

29:02.580 --> 29:04.030
Yeah. Heh.

29:04.940 --> 29:06.480
Even knowing about how I grew up?

29:06.520 --> 29:07.540
You can't help that,

29:07.570 --> 29:09.760
you can only help what
kind of person you are.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.260
And I think you're a wonderful person.

29:13.810 --> 29:15.080
Thanks,Grace.

29:20.730 --> 29:22.710
I have to go. It's late.

29:22.790 --> 29:24.440
Foster parents will
be worried about me.

29:24.480 --> 29:25.670
Okay.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.270
Hey,there's someone at the door.

29:45.310 --> 29:46.510
So?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.560
Oh,God. Stay down!

29:55.120 --> 29:57.680
Sorry,kid,I tried calling you.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.500
Your mom asked me to check on you.

29:59.550 --> 30:01.720
She tried calling you on her layover.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.080
Are you okay?

30:05.190 --> 30:07.280
Uh...Ricky?

30:07.330 --> 30:10.260
Yeah,this is kind of awkward.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.620
Um,maybe you should leave.

30:12.650 --> 30:15.690
Okay,Dad! I'm okay,
I'm sorry you came over.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.480
But you can go home now.

30:18.490 --> 30:21.120
@#$%^!

30:21.170 --> 30:22.560
Hey,Reuben.

30:22.590 --> 30:24.360
Okay,we weren't doing anything.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.380
We were just talking.

30:25.410 --> 30:26.450
With your shirt off?

30:26.490 --> 30:28.120
It's hot in here,don't you think?

30:28.150 --> 30:29.020
What does that mean?

30:29.070 --> 30:29.820
You know what it means.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.220
This is my stepson.
This is your stepbrother.

30:32.260 --> 30:33.980
Technically,but not really.

30:34.020 --> 30:35.060
What are you doing here?

30:35.100 --> 30:39.480
Mom wanted me to drop by
and check things out.

30:39.510 --> 30:40.460
What?

30:40.510 --> 30:42.060
And everything checked out.

30:42.110 --> 30:43.090
Night,Adrian.

30:43.130 --> 30:45.040
Good night. Call me.

30:47.960 --> 30:50.340
So I was thinking,maybe I could
come and live with you.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.530
You have a problem.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.410
Do I?

30:52.450 --> 30:54.330
Do you sleep with every guy you meet?

30:54.360 --> 30:55.330
No,

30:55.370 --> 30:57.370
and all we did was sleep.

30:57.410 --> 30:58.830
Well,and make out.

30:58.870 --> 31:00.240
But he is cute.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.910
I forbid you from ever seeing him again.

31:04.270 --> 31:06.180
Forbid?

31:06.210 --> 31:08.150
Well,that's powerful statement.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.600
Not powerful enough to actually
keep me from seeing him,

31:10.630 --> 31:12.730
but still,a strong statement.

31:12.770 --> 31:14.340
You've never had a daughter,have you?

31:14.380 --> 31:16.660
Adrian,do not see him again.

31:16.720 --> 31:19.710
Well,I might see him tonight
if you don't stay here.

31:19.750 --> 31:22.630
But,if you do stay here,
then your wife is gonna think

31:22.670 --> 31:24.890
there's something going
on with you and my mother.

31:25.980 --> 31:28.060
But evidently your wife
doesn't know that.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.480
Or she wouldn't have sent
that cute boy over to find out.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.140
Why is it that
I can get hardened criminals

31:32.190 --> 31:34.060
to listen to me,but you won't?

31:34.090 --> 31:36.550
Because they've broken
the law and I haven't.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.810
He's not my real brother.

31:38.850 --> 31:40.250
I'm going home.

31:40.300 --> 31:44.380
But we're gonna talk about this
again and again,until you get it.

31:45.310 --> 31:47.600
And if you want me in your
life as your father,

31:47.650 --> 31:49.970
you better start showing me  a little bit more respect.

31:50.010 --> 31:52.830
Well,why don't you just
add "missy" to the end of that?

31:52.860 --> 31:56.140
You better show me  more respect,missy.

31:56.170 --> 31:57.660
Good night.

31:57.710 --> 31:59.100
Good night,Daddy.

31:59.130 --> 32:01.090
Oh,and say good  night to my brother.

32:07.780 --> 32:09.560
Oh,hey,man,sorry I'm late.

32:09.590 --> 32:12.170
I had a couple extra hours
at work,I had to take it.

32:13.450 --> 32:15.250
So,what you two been up to,

32:15.270 --> 32:17.960
besides making the world
a better place for humanity?

32:18.010 --> 32:18.760
We were just talking.

32:18.790 --> 32:21.020
Yeah,Duncan,we were just talking.

32:21.060 --> 32:21.660
Really?

32:21.700 --> 32:24.740
Looks as if you were doing
a little bit more than just talking.

32:24.780 --> 32:28.310
I guess I'll just go ahead
and let you two continue

32:28.350 --> 32:30.790
doing whatever you was doing.

32:31.480 --> 32:32.560
Good night.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.890
I am the worst mentor ever.

32:38.930 --> 32:41.080
Eh,he's not that bad a kid.

32:41.110 --> 32:42.950
He doesn't need that much mentoring.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.070
He just needs to get
out once in a while.

32:45.930 --> 32:48.230
Oh,man,this is gonna change everything.

32:48.280 --> 32:51.700
I still want to continue to
build a relationship with Duncan.

32:52.780 --> 32:55.320
I'm just-- I'm really into you.

32:55.350 --> 33:00.180
I think you're gorgeous
and sexy and smart.

33:00.650 --> 33:02.040
And you smell good.

33:02.410 --> 33:06.410
And this isn't just like a passing
thing for me when I feel this way.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.850
I'm a serious kind of guy
just to let you know.

33:08.890 --> 33:10.340
Completely monogamous.

33:10.380 --> 33:13.170
When I fall,I fall hard.

33:13.210 --> 33:15.560
And I have fallen.

33:15.590 --> 33:18.300
And this was great.
And you were great.

33:18.340 --> 33:21.400
I just hope this isn't gonna
make things awkward between us.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.800
It's not gonna be awkward for me.

33:24.180 --> 33:25.630
I have a boyfriend.

33:28.890 --> 33:30.840
You're in high school.

33:30.870 --> 33:33.560
I was just having a little fun.

33:33.590 --> 33:35.000
I mean you're good-looking,

33:35.060 --> 33:37.840
but you're in high school.

33:39.380 --> 33:41.270
Yeah,um...

33:41.300 --> 33:42.940
Yeah,I'm gonna go.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.360
See you next week?

33:44.400 --> 33:45.420
Yep.

33:49.180 --> 33:50.200
Hi.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.400
Hi.

33:57.280 --> 33:59.040
So no one wanted the stuffed mushrooms?

33:59.080 --> 34:01.790
No time for mushrooms.
Lots of fighting going on.

34:01.820 --> 34:02.580
Fighting?

34:02.630 --> 34:04.130
You want the blow by blow?

34:04.160 --> 34:05.440
I think I do.

34:06.150 --> 34:07.140
Okay.

34:07.180 --> 34:08.920
Amy got in a fight
with Ben and Ricky,

34:08.960 --> 34:10.690
and then she went to her room.

34:10.730 --> 34:13.540
Then Ben and Ricky got in
a fight,and then Ricky left.

34:13.580 --> 34:15.360
Then Ben went and told off Amy,

34:15.400 --> 34:17.100
and now she's just moping
around in her room

34:17.139 --> 34:18.739
because Ben won't pick up his phone.

34:18.770 --> 34:19.920
What were they fighting about?

34:19.960 --> 34:21.300
You're kidding,right?

34:21.350 --> 34:23.550
Take a guess. No one wants the baby.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.630
Amy doesn't want him.
Ricky doesn't want him.

34:25.679 --> 34:28.570
Well,Ben wants him,
but only if Amy wants him,

34:28.610 --> 34:30.760
and even he admits
he can't take care of him.

34:30.810 --> 34:32.880
And you're telling me this
because you think your father and I

34:32.940 --> 34:34.800
can get back together and
I can take care of him?

34:34.830 --> 34:36.449
That Judas Priest.

34:36.489 --> 34:37.699
Iscariot.

34:37.750 --> 34:38.540
What?

34:38.590 --> 34:40.070
Judas Priest is a band.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.719
I didn't even know
they had bands back then.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.620
Maybe if you meet with Reverend
Stone,you'll learn something.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.270
No,thank you,especially
after heted me out.

34:47.310 --> 34:48.710
Ashley,

34:48.770 --> 34:51.590
your father and I are not
going to get back together.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.969
And your sister wants
to find a home for her baby.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.420
You have to accept those things.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.000
I don't wanna accept
either of those things,

34:57.030 --> 34:58.780
because you and Dad should be together,

34:58.820 --> 35:00.710
and Amy should
take care of her baby.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.580
And you should
mind your own business.

35:02.890 --> 35:03.990
You're 13 years old.

35:04.020 --> 35:06.000
You don't know
what's best for everyone.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.560
You don't even know
what's best for you.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.860
Oh,and you do?

35:08.900 --> 35:10.850
That's where I'm drawing the line.

35:10.900 --> 35:11.670
Right there.

35:11.700 --> 35:13.930
I have been extremely tolerant

35:13.950 --> 35:15.930
of the way that you talk
to me and to everyone else

35:15.970 --> 35:18.370
And that's because I know
how much pain you're in.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.360
And you know how I know?

35:20.400 --> 35:23.160
Because we are all in a lot of pain.

35:23.180 --> 35:27.260
And yet,no one talks to anyone in that
sarcastic tone of yours except for you.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.210
And I think I know why.

35:29.230 --> 35:32.300
I think it's because you don't
want to admit how much you're hurting.

35:32.350 --> 35:34.270
And I'm sorry,Ashley.

35:34.300 --> 35:37.500
I'm sorry that things have turned
out the way that they have.

35:37.530 --> 35:40.710
I'm sorry that your father
and I can't stay together.

35:40.740 --> 35:43.880
I'm sorry that your sister
is having a baby at 15.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.180
But you can't talk to me
like that anymore.

35:47.210 --> 35:49.310
I'm serious,I've had enough.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.540
Okay.

35:50.570 --> 35:51.630
Okay?

35:51.680 --> 35:54.000
I won't talk like that anymore.

35:54.540 --> 35:56.960
And I really don't know

35:56.990 --> 36:00.970
what's best for you or
for Dad or for Amy.

36:01.010 --> 36:02.650
And I admit it.

36:02.690 --> 36:04.320
I'm hurting.

36:06.050 --> 36:08.630
Just not nearly as much
as the three of you.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.770
The three of you are idiots.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.680
I know.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.730
Can we get you some more?

36:24.750 --> 36:26.870
I love to cook for people
who eat like you.

36:26.920 --> 36:28.110
Me too.

36:28.140 --> 36:31.340
I just can't believe it's taken
us 10 years to have you over.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.620
I'm so happy you're here.

36:33.650 --> 36:34.760
Happy to be here.

36:34.790 --> 36:36.130
You queens live like kings.

36:37.390 --> 36:39.960
You must be good with your money
to live like this on your salary.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.400
Oh,I just work for fun,George.

36:42.430 --> 36:44.250
I love working at the furniture store.

36:44.290 --> 36:46.060
I've learned so much from you.

36:46.090 --> 36:46.730
Like what?

36:46.770 --> 36:49.700
Don't buy the white couch until
they start making white dirt.

36:49.730 --> 36:51.570
Yeah,that's a good one.  Dads love that.

36:54.700 --> 36:57.160
Uh,you know,I have money.

36:57.190 --> 37:00.090
We're financially stable,Donnie and I.

37:00.130 --> 37:03.820
I designed a line of organic baby
clothing years ago that caught on,

37:04.780 --> 37:05.630
and it's still going.

37:05.670 --> 37:08.360
Hey,I know someone who might
be needing some of that. Amy.

37:08.390 --> 37:10.220
Oh,Amy,she's such a lovely girl.

37:10.260 --> 37:12.430
Yeah,she's thinking
about adoption,you know.

37:12.460 --> 37:14.840
Yeah,you had mentioned that.

37:17.690 --> 37:18.380
What?

37:18.400 --> 37:21.320
You know Leon and I would
love to be parents.

37:21.370 --> 37:22.790
Heh. Good luck with that.

37:22.830 --> 37:24.670
I think we're gonna
need more than luck.

37:25.670 --> 37:28.980
- Ah,we're gonna need--
- An understanding family.

37:29.030 --> 37:29.900
A what?

37:29.950 --> 37:32.420
George,do you think
Amy would ever consider

37:32.460 --> 37:35.700
letting Leon and
me adopt her baby?

37:52.710 --> 37:53.910
Jack?

37:57.410 --> 37:59.020
What are you doing here again?

38:01.150 --> 38:02.550
I saw a light on.

38:07.250 --> 38:08.230
Are you okay?

38:08.270 --> 38:09.750
No,I'm not okay.

38:10.190 --> 38:11.380
But I still want you to be okay.

38:11.430 --> 38:14.540
Because you're the
only nice girl I know.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.460
So listen.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.650
Don't wear your heart on your sleeve,

38:19.960 --> 38:22.690
because someone's only gonna
come along and rip it in half,

38:22.710 --> 38:24.700
throw it to the ground
and stomp on it.

38:24.730 --> 38:26.380
The mentoring isn't working out?

38:26.690 --> 38:28.040
Life isn't working out.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.850
And I'm torn. I know
I shouldn't say anything

38:29.900 --> 38:31.150
because it's just none of my business

38:31.180 --> 38:33.070
and I should just stay out of it.

38:34.160 --> 38:37.310
But you're such an innocent,
decent,trusting,human being

38:37.880 --> 38:38.880
and Ricky's not.

38:38.910 --> 38:40.100
Oh,Jack.

38:40.130 --> 38:41.730
I'm just gonna say it.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.940
Ricky's still sleeping with Adrian.

38:55.010 --> 38:56.760
I just want to put some
stuff in the refrigerator.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.210
So it doesn't go bad.

38:58.660 --> 39:00.360
Chicken Ã©touffÃ©e.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.010
Oh,don't be sad,baby.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.450
Hey,I might have some
good news for you.

39:04.490 --> 39:06.160
I might have a couple
who will adopt.

39:06.190 --> 39:07.560
You're against adoption.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.780
Not if it's the right couple,

39:08.810 --> 39:12.050
and I can see my grandson.
You can see your son.

39:12.090 --> 39:13.640
Ricky didn't agree to anything.

39:13.670 --> 39:14.490
What?

39:14.530 --> 39:15.980
Doesn't want the baby adopted.

39:16.010 --> 39:17.910
And he doesn't want to
take care of the baby.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.680
My son needs to be
loved by two adults

39:19.720 --> 39:21.610
who can provide everything
for him that I can't.

39:21.650 --> 39:25.360
Yeah,two people who love
each other,and are mature,

39:25.390 --> 39:27.880
and have jobs and savings
and a home of their own.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.620
Two guys who can cook and are fun
to be with and love children,

39:30.660 --> 39:31.820
and are pretty good athletes too.

39:31.860 --> 39:33.280
Did you just say two guys?

39:33.310 --> 39:34.510
Did I?

39:35.280 --> 39:36.590
Do not tell your mother.

39:36.620 --> 39:38.640
If she doesn't come up with the
idea,she will not go along with it.

39:38.690 --> 39:41.910
I know you love her best.
I know her better than you do.

39:41.940 --> 39:42.770
What two guys?

39:42.810 --> 39:44.130
Donovan. And the other one.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.690
- Heh. Leon?
- Yeah.

39:45.740 --> 39:47.140
- Really?
- Really.

39:47.180 --> 39:49.860
All we gotta do is get Ricky on
board and lead your mother to them.

39:49.910 --> 39:51.150
Bread crumbs.

40:00.890 --> 40:01.530
It's Grace.

40:01.570 --> 40:02.600
Don't.

40:03.410 --> 40:04.480
Grace?

40:04.520 --> 40:05.860
Is Ricky there?

40:06.630 --> 40:08.260
I- Is Ricky here?

40:08.300 --> 40:10.120
I know he's there,Adrian.

40:13.850 --> 40:15.420
Will you tell Ricky his
phone is ringing?

40:15.470 --> 40:17.690
I don't know. What phone?

40:17.730 --> 40:19.250
I don't hear anything.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.280
You're a really bad
friend,you know that?

40:21.310 --> 40:22.330
Okay.

40:22.370 --> 40:24.570
Tell Ricky he's a
really bad boyfriend.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.810
But you know what?

40:25.850 --> 40:27.390
I still love him.

40:27.940 --> 40:29.350
And once he works through his issues

40:29.400 --> 40:31.800
so that he doesn't have to avoid
his pain by sleeping with you,

40:31.840 --> 40:33.650
he'll realize he loves me too.

40:33.700 --> 40:34.870
Will you tell him that?

40:34.900 --> 40:36.330
Tell him yourself.

40:40.340 --> 40:43.020
Grace,look,we're just talking,
Adrian and me--

40:43.060 --> 40:45.890
Ricky,it's me. Amy.

40:45.930 --> 40:46.960
Amy?

40:46.990 --> 40:48.580
- Amy?
- Amy?

40:48.620 --> 40:49.880
Is everything okay?

40:49.920 --> 40:51.520
Everything will be okay.

40:51.570 --> 40:53.900
Everything will be fine
once you decide that

40:53.930 --> 40:55.880
the decision to have the baby adopted

40:55.910 --> 40:58.060
or not adopted is my decision.

40:58.100 --> 41:00.950
And if I decide to have
the baby adopted,

41:00.990 --> 41:02.650
I will decide who
the parents should be,

41:02.680 --> 41:04.560
and you will go along with that,

41:04.590 --> 41:08.240
because it's not your life that has
changed or will change,it's my life.

41:08.270 --> 41:10.850
And I don't even know if you
really care about this baby

41:10.900 --> 41:14.190
or if you're just trying to impress
Grace or Adrian or someone else.

41:14.230 --> 41:17.040
I don't even think you know how
you really feel about this child

41:17.080 --> 41:19.060
or if you really feel anything at all.

41:19.380 --> 41:20.850
But I do.

41:21.240 --> 41:24.500
And,uh,if you think you  love this child,

41:24.530 --> 41:26.640
and you too want the best for him,

41:26.690 --> 41:28.160
let me do this my way.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.310
Don't you want what's best
for your son,Ricky?

41:31.030 --> 41:33.810
Look,in my desperation to
figure this whole thing out,

41:33.840 --> 41:34.920
I asked you to come over,

41:34.970 --> 41:39.060
just to see if there's any possibility
of the two of us raising this baby together,

41:39.100 --> 41:41.380
helping each other out,
just for the sake of the baby.

41:41.430 --> 41:43.980
I realize that there are a lot
of different types of families

41:44.020 --> 41:46.940
and we didn't have to be married
to be a family for this child.

41:47.500 --> 41:50.300
We could just be friends,
do this together as friends.

41:53.120 --> 41:54.970
But,uh...

41:55.710 --> 41:57.250
We're not friends.

41:59.030 --> 42:02.520
And it's just not what's best
for him,you and me.

42:03.820 --> 42:05.280
And you know that.

42:05.320 --> 42:09.511
And I fully accept responsibility
for letting things go too far 

42:09.511 --> 42:11.760
with you on that
one night at band camp.

42:14.380 --> 42:18.070
And I also fully accept the
responsibility of making all these decisions.

42:22.010 --> 42:23.990
So please,

42:25.130 --> 42:27.740
just go along with me.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.230
Please?

42:31.380 --> 42:34.640
Okay. Whatever you want.
