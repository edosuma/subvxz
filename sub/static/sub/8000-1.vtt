00:25.560 --> 00:30.111
(people chanting)
Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly!

00:51.520 --> 00:53.511
(cheering)

01:03.440 --> 01:06.512
And now let's welcome
our hometown hero,

01:06.600 --> 01:10.115
the next governor
of Washington, Al Donnelly!

01:10.200 --> 01:11.997
(cheering)

01:14.400 --> 01:18.791
Attention, Buckley residents.
Voters of all ages, vote for Al Donnelly.

01:18.880 --> 01:23.032
He's the best man for the job.
You can count on Al, that's for sure.

01:23.120 --> 01:27.511
Folks, if you're wondering who to vote
for, Al Donnelly's the man for the job.

01:30.760 --> 01:35.151
I have to go home now, little doggies.
Nothing for you in this truck. No food.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.910
Dogs, I want you to go home.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.752
Get off my bumper!

01:41.320 --> 01:44.357
Come on! Jesus!

01:45.720 --> 01:47.472
Aaagh!

01:47.800 --> 01:49.028
Oh, God!

01:52.640 --> 01:54.631
Oh, my God.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.637
What is with you dogs?! D'you think
this truck is in heat or something?

02:02.720 --> 02:04.711
Get out of here!

02:06.760 --> 02:11.197
If I got the same welcome everywhere
I went that I got here in my home town,

02:11.440 --> 02:13.954
my candidacy would be a lock!

02:14.040 --> 02:15.598
(cheering)

02:19.360 --> 02:21.396
(barks)

02:25.520 --> 02:29.752
With your help, we will make it
all the way to the Capitol!

02:32.200 --> 02:37.149
(chanting) Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly!
Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly!

02:37.240 --> 02:40.232
(amplified barking and growling)

02:43.720 --> 02:46.917
- Did you do this?
- No, no, no... Did you?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.031
(growling)

03:03.400 --> 03:04.913
Oh, my God.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.758
Oh, my God.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.836
- (woman screams)
- Mother...

03:35.880 --> 03:37.757
Oh, there is a God.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.635
Tell me that is not your brother.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.239
What the hell is a marquee doin' here?
It's crazy!

03:49.800 --> 03:53.110
Al, I'm so sorry.
Man, I don't know what happened.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.873
Mike, forget it.
Did you think it was a drive-in movie?

03:55.960 --> 03:56.949
(both laugh)

03:57.720 --> 03:59.199
(blasts horn)

03:59.520 --> 04:04.548
I could get time off from the rec centre.
They said I could, to help you campaign.

04:04.640 --> 04:08.713
So I was thinking maybe I could go
on the road with you and help out, or...

04:08.800 --> 04:13.715
Mike, I know you're behind me 100%,
but I need some different help from you.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.714
Oh, man, whatever you want.
You know that.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.189
- Fighting Donnellys stick together!
- Right!

04:19.279 --> 04:23.159
Listen, I got a lot of good people
in my corner. They want what we want.

04:23.240 --> 04:27.199
And we're gonna get there.
It's just gonna take some finesse.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.273
I'll do anything.
Just name it and I'll get started.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.194
There's a lot to be done right here,
like phone canvassing, stuff like that.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.477
So stay put and I'll get you
the details. All right?

04:37.560 --> 04:40.233
- We gonna do it, little brother?
- Yeah!

04:42.000 --> 04:45.595
- Come on. Let's go.
- All the way, Governor.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.195
Dock Workers' Union.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.716
Let me make myself clear.
My brother is a priority.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.394
Let's just find someone
in the organisation.

05:02.480 --> 05:07.031
Just as long as he or she is reliable
and helps Mike make a contribution.

05:07.120 --> 05:11.955
So just find someone and
give them the assignment... now.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.952
(man) Excuse me <i>, </i> Mr "About to be
Governor Elect" Donnelly.

05:15.040 --> 05:20.398
This assignment you describe <i>, </i>
if someone volunteered and did it well <i>, </i>

05:20.480 --> 05:23.995
would he or she earn a staff position
in your new administration?

05:24.080 --> 05:28.392
- Steve, not now.
- Hey. Uh, yes.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.994
He or she most certainly would.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.711
Then I am your man.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.395
(ringing tone)

05:40.480 --> 05:44.075
Hi. This is Mike Donnelly. I work
over here at the recreational centre.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.720
To be honest,
I pretty much run the place!

05:46.800 --> 05:49.678
Is this, uh, Pat Giles?

05:49.760 --> 05:50.954
Good. Good.

05:51.040 --> 05:56.239
Hey, I hope everything's going great in
your fine town of, uh, Avery... Atwood.

05:57.240 --> 06:01.597
The reason I'm calling is I wanted to tell
you about the candidacy of Al Donnelly.

06:01.680 --> 06:06.435
Al Donnelly's a guy with a dream. His
dream is to be governor of Washington.

06:06.520 --> 06:12.629
Hell, every guy's got his dream, am I
right? I had a doozie myself last night!

06:12.720 --> 06:17.475
Get this: a cornfed harvest mouse,
a hooker, a nun, a Flemish woman,

06:17.720 --> 06:21.349
whips, chains, whistles,
yo-yos, a circus midget,

06:21.440 --> 06:25.399
my grandmother riding by on a bicycle
giving me the finger, and a duck.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.836
Now, I don't know... Are you crying?

06:29.160 --> 06:31.628
Oh, my Lord. I am sorry.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.996
Honey, please don't. Could you
get your daddy on the phone?

06:35.080 --> 06:37.833
- No, don't hang up, please. I...
- (hangs up)

06:41.640 --> 06:43.517
Whoa.

06:43.600 --> 06:48.196
All right, I want a 32 belly option
on two, on two. Ready? Break!

06:52.400 --> 06:54.356
Hut one. Hut two.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.431
Let's do it!

07:05.360 --> 07:06.952
Oh, hey, little girls.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.597
Yeah!

07:10.680 --> 07:14.150
(cheering and whooping)

07:14.240 --> 07:16.549
This sucks! These teams aren't fair.

07:16.640 --> 07:20.838
What's wrong, Sullivan? You mad cos
you found out the new kid got an arm?

07:20.920 --> 07:24.515
- Suckers, take the walk.
- Screw this. I quit.

07:25.480 --> 07:28.870
Fine then. Here's to the winners. Yeah!

07:28.960 --> 07:32.999
Kemp, fake head butt. DeSalvo, fake
head butt. New kid, fake head butt.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.355
Ow! You broke my nose!

07:35.560 --> 07:36.754
Oh!

07:36.840 --> 07:41.709
- There's so much blood.
- I swear I did not mean to do it! Please!

07:41.800 --> 07:43.995
- Ketchup packet.
- (laughter)

07:44.080 --> 07:46.992
Come on, guys. This is weird.
Let's go play some kickball.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.071
Yeah, come on.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.356
Forget those guys.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.908
- What's your name?
- Scott Colleary.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.592
Colleary.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.478
- You got a hell of an arm, Colleary.
- Thanks.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.959
Yeah.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.077
- Don't worry about those guys.
- They don't like me too much.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.357
- Is your mom picking you up?
- My mom and dad got a divorce.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.874
I have to live with my grandma now.

08:15.960 --> 08:20.795
Oh, come on. Label your streets
like the rest of the country.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.154
Oh! Oh! Buddy, are you OK?

08:27.680 --> 08:31.434
I'm not that far from dragging you
out of the car and beating you into dust.

08:31.520 --> 08:35.308
You should work up to that.
Kind of leaves you nowhere to go.

08:36.360 --> 08:39.830
I can go to your mama's
and start a small fire in her panties.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.150
Now, are you ready
to get out of the car?

08:42.840 --> 08:47.231
No, sir. You know what?
That was my fault and I'm really sorry.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.959
Here, I got something for you.
It's a souvenir.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.395
Oh, here it is! Yeah!

08:52.480 --> 08:54.118
Goodbye!

08:59.920 --> 09:01.751
- Oh, shit.
- (honking)

09:01.840 --> 09:03.637
I don't believe this.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.915
Damn it. I gotta ditch this guy.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.517
Hey!

09:21.320 --> 09:24.278
- That's my grandma. Mrs Oneacre.
- Hi, ma'am.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.555
Bet you made
some nice friends today, huh?

09:28.280 --> 09:30.271
(Scott) See ya.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.675
Scott. God gave you
a hell of a throwin' arm,

09:36.760 --> 09:38.910
and I'll be damned
if I'll let that go to waste.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.515
I want you on the field every day
working on your game. How's that?

09:42.600 --> 09:44.909
- Sure.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.237
- Hey, Mikey.
- Hey, Robbie.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.835
I spoke to Anderson at the theatre.
He wants me to lock you up.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.990
I bet your brother's pissed, huh?

10:11.080 --> 10:13.719
No, he was pretty cool, as usual.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.597
I wanna show you something.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.877
In fact, I'm gonna be working
with one of his top guys.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.873
Whoa! Nitrous oxide boosters!

10:24.960 --> 10:28.236
- This thing must haul major ass.
- You could say that.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.157
Oh, great.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.037
Damn it.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.632
- Get out of my way, buddy.
- Lady, I got somethin' for ya.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.870
- A souvenir for you here.
- Yes?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.711
Never mind. Forget it.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.429
What are you doing?
Playing pocket pool there, son?

10:53.520 --> 10:56.751
- Excuse me.
- You got a little chubby goin' there.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.311
Dream on, you little fart.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.594
Please don't be Mike Donnelly.

11:16.680 --> 11:17.351
Hi.

11:17.440 --> 11:21.115
Hey. I'm Steve Dodds,
one of your brother's advisors.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.988
- His top advisor, actually.
- Wow. It's great to meet you.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.231
Nice to, um, see you.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.630
Al, your brother, told me
to drop everything, come down here,

11:31.720 --> 11:34.553
get you organised for the final push,
for the election.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.428
Well, let's get to it. Team Donnelly
gonna kick a little Tracy butt.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.238
Oh! Aaargh!

11:40.640 --> 11:45.634
What I thought is, we'd start with the
supermarket, canvass that area first.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.314
- I...
- No, trust me on this. It's a good idea.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.038
- But...
- Listen, I'm running this show.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.076
- I know what I'm doing.
- (moans)

11:54.920 --> 11:59.471
- D'you have to go to the bathroom?
- Please... pop... the hood.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.673
- Please!
- Oh, your thumbs. The hood. OK.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.355
- What latch? Where d'you want me to...
- Just pop the hood!

12:06.520 --> 12:08.511
Please!

12:08.600 --> 12:10.591
Popping the hood.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.275
(wails)

12:16.600 --> 12:19.831
Good afternoon. We'd like you
to vote Al Donnelly for governor.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.911
Yeah, thanks.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.591
- Hi, ma'am.
- (gasps)

12:25.560 --> 12:27.835
Vote for Donnelly.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.717
Sorry.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.439
I think it's better
if we bring the energy down a tad.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.954
Are you kidding me?
These are potential voters.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.077
It's showmanship.
You gotta go out and get 'em.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.151
Watch and learn.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.479
- Hi, folks. Vote for Donnelly!
- Good God, man.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.154
- Let me get that for you.
- Look, I drove down here.

12:46.240 --> 12:50.438
- I can put the groceries in the trunk.
- Help from the Donnelly campaign.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.238
- Back off, buster.
- Oh!

12:53.640 --> 12:56.108
- Come on, Mother.
- Let me help you, sir.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.317
- Get in the car, dear.
- All right, Mother.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.718
Folks, I'm having a little trouble here.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.598
Help! Help, please!

13:12.800 --> 13:15.598
He must be all hopped up
on crack cocaine.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.069
Floor it, Harold!

13:20.520 --> 13:22.590
I can't! I can't!

13:22.680 --> 13:24.910
Argh! Help!

13:27.280 --> 13:30.989
- Good. I think I've lost him.
- Stop! Please!

13:31.080 --> 13:33.275
Aargh!

13:33.360 --> 13:34.839
Aargh!

13:47.560 --> 13:49.152
OK.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.231
- Good first day.
- Yeah.

13:56.280 --> 14:00.193
Washington State.
Isn't it a great place to raise a family?

14:00.280 --> 14:03.989
That's because for the last eight years
I've worked hard as your governor

14:04.080 --> 14:08.596
to make sure our state
is clean, safe and fiscally sound.

14:08.680 --> 14:12.116
If re-elected to a third term,
I'll do my best as your governor

14:12.200 --> 14:16.079
to make sure that all the hopes and
dreams of Washingtonians come true.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.755
- (man) And cut.
- I need a break. I'll be right back.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.871
Did you get the latest polls?

14:23.800 --> 14:28.032
Donnelly's brother took a campaign van
on a rampage. He can't get a break!

14:28.120 --> 14:32.398
- But they gained another two points.
- We're OK. A lot can be done in a week.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.075
If we don't do something soon,
he'll be living here.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.032
Who left this crap in here?

14:46.280 --> 14:48.510
Promise me you'll stay in the car.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.670
I promise.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.231
(excited chatter)

15:01.400 --> 15:05.951
Whoa! What have we got here?
A tall cool one!

15:06.040 --> 15:07.712
Yeah!

15:08.040 --> 15:09.712
Go for it.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.995
- I wanna get wrecked!
- (all laugh)

15:17.240 --> 15:19.470
Oh, yeah, man!

15:23.720 --> 15:28.748
# Smokin', snortin', shootin',
suckin', tokin', poppin', droppin'

15:29.120 --> 15:31.315
Let's do a little dance.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.358
A party with you!

15:36.800 --> 15:39.394
- The kid's a star.
- No, he's a gold mine.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.194
- (Mike) Ah. Horseshit!
- (glass smashes)

15:45.440 --> 15:48.432
- Front page.
- Jesus, Mike!

15:48.520 --> 15:52.354
But it turns out he was giving these
kids a speech about saying no to drugs.

15:52.440 --> 15:57.355
- Can the paper print a retraction?
- They'll run it on page 36 in two weeks!

15:58.720 --> 16:01.280
Al, you can take this election.

16:01.360 --> 16:06.718
But your brother is creating his own
media feeding frenzy-all negative.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.394
We have got to put a lid on him.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.392
You're right.
But he doesn't deserve to be exiled.

16:12.480 --> 16:17.031
You just tell Steve to watch him like a
hawk and to keep the reporters at bay.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.712
(cheering)

16:19.800 --> 16:23.429
Welcome, Washington
Teachers' Association!

16:23.600 --> 16:25.397
Welcome!

16:26.640 --> 16:31.111
Washington has the most
beautiful forests in America.

16:31.200 --> 16:35.751
And I am proud to be
an honorary Clark County lumberjack.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.839
- The tree's not falling.
- Yeah, I know.

16:47.760 --> 16:51.116
Don't let anyone ever tell you
your job is easy.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.276
Oh, my God!

17:03.760 --> 17:04.714
You make the call. The rest
is for damage control. You stay put.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.554
Thank you, gentlemen.
Excuse us just a moment.

17:11.079 --> 17:14.117
What happened? It should've
gone down on the first whack.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.031
You covered really well.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.953
You're lucky a kid didn't get
his head cracked wide open.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.029
Yes, ma'am.

17:20.119 --> 17:23.795
- Did you get the numbers in?
- Oh. Hot off the wire.

17:25.560 --> 17:29.519
- Donnelly's levelled off.
- Mm-hm. We're dead even. Look at this.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.439
Front page.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.512
"Donnelly's brother is like
Roger Clinton, Billy Carter

17:35.600 --> 17:38.592
and Ronald Reagan's
entire family rolled into one."

17:39.200 --> 17:43.671
Let's move this out of the land of
mere embarrassment into the realm...

17:43.760 --> 17:45.671
of serious effect.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.718
- Ready to play the game?
- I've got some pretty nasty ideas.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.439
Good. Act on them.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.158
- I've been fired.
- What? Why?

17:56.240 --> 17:59.710
He said the rec centre's state-funded.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.792
He can't afford to be associated
with any kind of a scandal,

18:02.880 --> 18:06.077
especially one
involving kids and drugs.

18:06.160 --> 18:11.553
He said he stood up for me, but word
came from the top for me to get out.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.434
It's crazy, man.
I don't know what to say.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.717
I love this job. I've been here
since the place opened.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.471
And then they just...

18:25.240 --> 18:30.189
Dude, can I get a couple of minutes
just to clear some of the gear out?

18:30.600 --> 18:32.591
Yeah, sure.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.989
Hey, I'm sorry, man. Take your time.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.911
(chatter)

19:48.800 --> 19:51.109
Hey, fellas. How's it goin'?
Can I help you?

19:53.200 --> 19:58.035
Hey, Mike. How's things? Kind of
pissed off about losing your job, huh?

19:58.680 --> 20:03.435
- All right, pal. What's goin' on here?
- You shouldn't play with matches.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.949
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

20:10.640 --> 20:12.437
God!

20:17.320 --> 20:18.912
(Mike shouts)

20:21.080 --> 20:23.071
Shit!

20:23.960 --> 20:25.632
Oh, my God!

20:29.040 --> 20:32.316
- Why in the hell?! No!
- (siren)

20:32.400 --> 20:34.994
Mike, how the hell did this happen?

20:43.720 --> 20:47.429
- Robbie, you know I didn't do this.
- Jesus, Mike. Give me some credit.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.318
- Did you see who did it?
- Two guys. I don't know them.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.437
They didn't count on me getting here
first. Look, get out of here.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.991
When the troopers arrive, I'll tell them
I didn't find anybody here. All right?

20:58.080 --> 21:00.389
- Go ahead. Take off.
- Thanks, Robbie.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.870
- I owe you one, man.
- Call me later.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.439
(distant sirens)

21:05.520 --> 21:09.718
Base, this is Mieghem. I'm at the rec
centre. Send fire units and a backup.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.791
I'm the only one down here.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.911
- Well, did he do it or not?
- Kovary, I lean toward the negative.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.230
- I know what you're saying.
- Shh.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.118
Give me the phone.
Steve, it's Al. What is going on?

21:23.200 --> 21:27.398
- Hey, Al. Well, in my opinion...
- I wanna talk to my brother.

21:27.600 --> 21:31.149
Al, I know how this must look,
but I had nothing to do with that fire.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.836
I loved that place. It was my life.
You gotta believe me!

21:34.920 --> 21:38.959
I believe you. You were set up. And
we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.429
We have a game plan. Don't we, Roger?

21:42.720 --> 21:46.110
- Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
- Roger and Steve'll work it out.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.829
Mike, don't worry.
Everything is gonna be OK, I promise.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.911
Thanks, Al. Thanks.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.232
- Steve here.
- Meet me downstairs in the lobby.

21:58.560 --> 22:02.189
Dodds, listen to me very carefully.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.829
We have got to keep this... this bozo

22:05.920 --> 22:08.514
under wraps until the election is over.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.797
Now, I want you to do
exactly as I tell you.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.952
- Yeah. OK. Keep talking.
- I know a place way outside town.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.514
All right! Bunk beds!

22:45.880 --> 22:48.678
- I got dibs on top.
- OK.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.796
(Steve) First class, right?

22:51.880 --> 22:54.474
- What's that black thing?
- What?

22:58.960 --> 23:01.155
I don't know.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.036
- Touch it.
- What? You touch it.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.156
- You afraid?
- No, I'll touch it.

23:07.840 --> 23:11.310
- You totally didn't touch it.
- Well, then you touch it.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.994
- I will if you will.
- All right.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.629
- (bat screeches)
- (both) Whoa! Man!

23:19.120 --> 23:21.873
- What is that?
- It's Ozzy Osbourne. Whoa!

23:22.120 --> 23:24.111
Oh, my God.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.354
Whoa.

23:26.440 --> 23:29.352
- I think it's gone.
- I hate those damn things.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.273
- (screeching)
- Oh, man!

23:32.360 --> 23:33.759
Agh! Agh!

23:33.840 --> 23:37.389
It bit me! I'm gonna get rabies!

23:37.480 --> 23:39.471
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.991
Come on! Oh!

23:50.600 --> 23:52.670
I got an idea. OK?

23:52.760 --> 23:56.435
I'll open the fridge, you hit the lights.
Bats are attracted to light.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.796
He'll fly in the fridge,
I close the door, end of story.

24:00.080 --> 24:03.789
- That's moths, you dumb-ass, not bats.
- Oh, yeah, moths.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.357
Eegh!

24:07.160 --> 24:08.752
Watch this.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.589
That's it. Corner it.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.231
- I think I got it.
- No way.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.914
- I think it's in there.
- Well, then look.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.231
You look.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.517
All right. We'll both look together.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.433
One, two...

24:42.520 --> 24:44.511
- Three!
- Agh!

24:45.240 --> 24:46.958
You idiot!

24:47.040 --> 24:50.635
You can't catch a bat with a pot, moron.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.518
You take a mop and a broom... Oh!

24:53.800 --> 24:57.475
- Oh, God! Oh! Oh! Oh, God!
- (screeches)

25:04.680 --> 25:06.955
Get this thing off me!
What the hell are you...

25:07.040 --> 25:08.678
Ow! Ow!

25:08.760 --> 25:12.548
Why are you hitting me? Ow!
It's gnawing at my skull.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.153
For God's sakes!

25:14.240 --> 25:16.470
Ow! Ow!

25:16.560 --> 25:20.553
- Die! Die!
- Please! You're aggravating it!

25:22.840 --> 25:25.638
Why are you kicking me? Ow!

25:25.720 --> 25:28.109
- I can't see a damn thing!
- Die!

25:28.200 --> 25:30.634
- Oh, Jesus!
- I think I nailed it!

25:30.720 --> 25:33.473
- (screeching)
- I don't believe it. He's still alive.

25:33.560 --> 25:36.393
Can we please try my idea?

25:36.480 --> 25:41.315
Come on! Hold the thing tight
so it gets in there.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.392
- I'm trying.
- Well, try harder. Stay over there.

25:44.480 --> 25:48.951
Moron! OK, it's flying in now. It's flying
in now. It's flying right in the middle.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.271
- It touched my hand.
- If this doesn't work I'll sleep in the car.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.954
Stay there. OK. OK.
It's right in the middle.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.838
OK, we got it, we got it, we got it...

25:57.920 --> 25:59.911
It's outta there.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.270
Good night, Steve.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.157
Good night, Mike.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.749
The police officer who arrived
before our guys was a friend of Mike's.

26:12.840 --> 26:17.868
He let him go and didn't report seeing
him, so Mike wasn't linked to the fire.

26:20.120 --> 26:25.353
Neuschwander, you finished stirring, or
is this a fucking science experiment?!

26:25.440 --> 26:30.309
I realise you must stick close together
cos you share a common backbone,

26:30.400 --> 26:32.994
but I wanna see some movement!

26:34.360 --> 26:35.839
Now!

26:37.800 --> 26:41.509
This is great. There's 1,502
registered voters in Garfield County.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.397
Go get 'em, Al.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.995
Hey, pretty good day. No screwups.
Keep up the good work.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.955
I'm gonna go take a squeege.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.994
Oh, God!

27:01.080 --> 27:02.274
(echoes)

27:09.040 --> 27:11.031
(insufficient signal tone)

27:19.520 --> 27:21.954
- (insufficient signal tone)
- (sighs)

27:27.240 --> 27:29.117
Eegh! Oh!

27:42.880 --> 27:44.871
(insufficient signal tone)

27:46.320 --> 27:48.311
What is wrong?

27:49.640 --> 27:53.269
Oh, something tells me
I want this car to just keep driving.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.991
Hey, gang.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.959
Is there an Opie convention in town?

28:05.240 --> 28:07.879
- I'm kidding.
- You're not from around here, huh?

28:08.600 --> 28:12.912
- You know what, I am. Born and raised.
- Nope. Can't be true.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.596
Fire!

28:35.240 --> 28:38.073
Thanks for not shoving
the nozzle up my ass first!

28:38.160 --> 28:41.118
(tyres screech <i>, </i> kids yell)

28:46.560 --> 28:49.154
- Vote for Donnelly.
- (echoes)

28:51.840 --> 28:53.831
Every vote counts.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.671
Argh!

29:09.120 --> 29:10.712
Oh.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.957
Aaargh!

29:19.280 --> 29:21.271
No, no, no, no!

29:27.160 --> 29:29.037
Oh. Oh.

29:29.120 --> 29:32.351
Oh, thank you, little roots.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.631
Please stay strong.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.630
What in the hell was that all about?

30:14.400 --> 30:17.915
You freaks better be careful,
cos next time I don't go down so easy.

30:18.120 --> 30:21.271
Next time I'll be, like, "You wanna
spray me? How about this?"

30:21.360 --> 30:23.032
Arm grab! Aie!

30:23.120 --> 30:25.350
Snap kick! Side kick!

30:26.160 --> 30:29.948
Rabbit punch!
Rabbit punch, into pile-driver!

30:30.040 --> 30:32.429
That's right, my friend. It's a pile-driver.

30:32.520 --> 30:35.034
Oh, who else wants some? You?

30:35.120 --> 30:38.112
Sleeper hold. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.231
Hey, that's my car.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.631
It's that same asshole. Whoo!

30:51.800 --> 30:53.028
- (phone rings)
- Oh.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.034
(imitates a "ringing" bird call)

30:57.120 --> 30:59.111
What the hell was that?

31:06.920 --> 31:10.515
Whoa, what happened to you?
D'you fall in some mud or something?

31:10.600 --> 31:13.239
Yeah, I did. And I'm gonna be rich,

31:13.320 --> 31:16.710
because I'm the only person on earth
who knows where to find white mud.

31:17.560 --> 31:22.270
I didn't say "mud". I said "crud".
D'you fall into some crud or something?

31:22.360 --> 31:26.990
- Get some water to wipe off that crud.
- I'm not a kid that'd believe that.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.799
- Shut up, Steve. Where'd you go?
- To make a call.

31:29.880 --> 31:35.238
Remember I told you a guy stole my
car? He's a mile away. He's driving it.

31:35.320 --> 31:40.394
- Well, let's go get it back.
- Uh-uh. This guy is unstable, at best.

31:40.480 --> 31:43.711
You can't keep running away
from things. You gotta be tough.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.439
Argh! Argh!

31:46.520 --> 31:49.592
Snakes! Oh, no!

31:49.680 --> 31:51.671
One looked at me!

31:53.200 --> 31:56.988
Check your underpants!
I hate those things!

31:59.080 --> 32:02.356
- This gets worse every second.
- I hate snakes!

32:06.360 --> 32:08.794
(both scream)

32:10.720 --> 32:12.995
Whoa. Check it out.

32:13.080 --> 32:17.119
- Jump in. Wash that crap off.
- There's probably piranha in there.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.829
- This place is a nightmare.
- Get tough, nancy boy. Jump in.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.511
I don't see you goin' in.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.791
Ugh.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.316
Where'd you go?

32:34.400 --> 32:37.073
Hello, Washington!

32:37.160 --> 32:39.469
Yeah!

32:39.560 --> 32:42.552
Aaaargh!

33:13.840 --> 33:16.354
De-de-de, do-do-do! (laughs)

33:16.440 --> 33:19.159
This is great. I've never won
three games in a row.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.231
I hardly ever play checkers.

33:21.320 --> 33:26.872
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know,
it's kinda easy to win when you, um...

33:26.960 --> 33:28.951
never move your back row!

33:29.480 --> 33:31.152
Ever!

33:31.240 --> 33:33.595
God! Come on!

33:33.960 --> 33:37.509
OK, well, where would you
want me to move this one?

33:39.800 --> 33:41.756
There.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.231
King me!

33:48.160 --> 33:51.516
OK. Move this one here.
It's safe, I swear. It's safe.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.874
(laughs)

33:52.960 --> 33:55.394
That wasn't safe at all.
What an idiot.

33:56.840 --> 33:59.434
- Oh, this is fun.
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.751
(bird cries)

34:12.080 --> 34:13.149
What's goin' on?

34:15.520 --> 34:17.511
That's not normal.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.195
(both scream)

34:43.960 --> 34:46.349
How the hell did that happen?

34:49.159 --> 34:50.559
Ow.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.596
Oh.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.670
Oh, man!

35:01.960 --> 35:05.316
- This place is trashed.
- Check this out.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.517
This whole fridge is held up here
just by this plug.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.318
(Mike screams)

35:14.200 --> 35:16.509
(groans)

35:22.120 --> 35:24.315
You OK?

35:26.200 --> 35:31.479
I'm just dandy! I got a bowl of
chocolate pudding in my underpants!

35:32.320 --> 35:35.118
We didn't have
any pudding in there, buddy.

35:38.480 --> 35:42.234
(Mike) This sucks. I can't believe
I forgot to call Scott Colleary.

35:42.320 --> 35:44.754
Good luck getting out.
It's never gonna work.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.593
Yes, it will.
All you need to do is get a signal.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.671
(insufficient signal tone)

36:00.200 --> 36:01.792
- (ringing tone)
- Hello?

36:01.880 --> 36:03.518
- Hello?
- Hello?

36:03.600 --> 36:04.794
- Hello?
- Hello?

36:04.880 --> 36:07.474
- Mrs Oneacre? Hello? Mrs Oneacre?
- Yes.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.832
Hello? Are you there?

36:12.920 --> 36:15.514
Hello. This is Mrs Oneacre.
Are you there?

36:16.920 --> 36:19.878
Mrs Oneacre, it's Mike Donnelly.
Is Scott there?

36:19.960 --> 36:21.916
No.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.514
Oh, jeez. I had to leave town.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.797
Could you tell him I'm sorry
and I'll make it up to him?

36:27.880 --> 36:30.394
- Yes.
- (moans) Don't forget to tell him that.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.471
- Bye.
- Hello?

36:54.800 --> 36:56.791
Good night, Steve.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.951
Good night, Mike.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.555
(wind howling)

37:05.680 --> 37:07.477
(creaking)

37:10.360 --> 37:12.351
(snores)

37:18.880 --> 37:20.677
Ow!

37:21.680 --> 37:22.954
Oh, man.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.470
- Oh, God.
- I don't like this, Mike.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.034
Mike?

37:32.040 --> 37:34.508
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

37:35.280 --> 37:37.271
(Steve) Whoa!

37:42.000 --> 37:43.991
This sucks!

37:45.080 --> 37:47.878
- Good night, Steve.
- Good night, Mike.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.471
(thunder rumbling)

38:12.120 --> 38:15.351
Hey, Mike. "I got dibs on top bunk"!

38:15.440 --> 38:17.032
Shut up.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.315
(laughs derisively)

38:19.400 --> 38:21.630
- Oh, I love it.
- Why don't you shut up?

38:21.720 --> 38:23.517
"Hello, Washington!"

38:23.960 --> 38:26.758
- How's the weather up there, buddy?
- Shut up!

38:26.840 --> 38:29.673
(Steve carries on laughing)

38:29.760 --> 38:31.751
Oh, no.

38:32.760 --> 38:33.636
Ow!

38:37.000 --> 38:39.468
- (ringing tone)
- Hello?

38:39.560 --> 38:43.678
Hey, Roger? How you doin'?
It's Mike Donnelly. Is Al there?

38:43.760 --> 38:46.320
Uh, gee, Mike.
Al's kind of busy right now.

38:46.400 --> 38:52.794
Ha, I know. I just wanted to tell him
I'm working my tail off for him up here,

38:52.880 --> 38:55.713
and there's no way
Al's gonna lose Gaffield County.

38:55.800 --> 38:59.031
That's great. I'll be sure to tell him.
Thanks for ringing up.

38:59.440 --> 39:02.557
Come on, let me talk to Al.
It's only gonna take a minute.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.960
Al doesn't wanna speak to you.

39:06.040 --> 39:09.157
What do you mean,
Al doesn't wanna speak to me? Why?

39:09.400 --> 39:11.391
Listen very carefully to me, Mike.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.358
You know what Al calls you
when you're not around here?

39:14.760 --> 39:18.275
The idiot. OK? All right?
Is that blunt enough for you?

39:18.360 --> 39:20.555
You are not going to speak to him now.

39:20.640 --> 39:25.077
And if I had my way, you wouldn't speak
to him after he's elected governor!

39:25.160 --> 39:27.151
(hangs up)

39:35.200 --> 39:38.397
Kovary. Man, that guy's a dick.

39:38.480 --> 39:41.790
Who is he to say
I can't talk to my own brother?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.598
You know?

39:43.680 --> 39:46.831
I ought to go down there
and straighten this thing out.

39:46.920 --> 39:48.911
What do you think, Steve?

39:49.240 --> 39:53.119
Al's speaking at that
Rock The Vote concert in Seattle.

39:53.680 --> 39:55.477
Steve?

39:58.560 --> 40:00.790
What do you think if I went down to...

40:15.920 --> 40:18.309
Oh, that's sad.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.911
(# rock music playing)

40:59.840 --> 41:01.432
Hey, it's cool. I was in.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.157
Where's the fire?

41:04.240 --> 41:07.630
Dude, we pay these bands' salaries
by buying a ticket to this shit.

41:07.720 --> 41:09.711
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.548
Okey-dokey. Come on.

41:12.640 --> 41:16.918
Son, step away from this vector and
get into a different coordinate, pronto.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.798
There's no access for you
in this quadrant.

41:19.880 --> 41:23.429
Man, why don't you goose-step on
down to the women and children there

41:23.520 --> 41:27.195
and give them your power trip?
They might be impressed by it, asshole!

41:27.280 --> 41:29.999
- Yeah!
- Young fellow, I'll twist off your head

41:30.080 --> 41:33.834
and spike it onto the floors
of a nightmare you can't even imagine!

41:33.920 --> 41:37.117
I will dance with you
inside of the six-sided ring of fire,

41:37.200 --> 41:41.398
unless you move from this area
far and fast! Now!

41:41.480 --> 41:43.630
(music stops)

41:43.720 --> 41:45.517
Wow!

41:47.000 --> 41:50.151
Man, I liked that move.

41:50.600 --> 41:54.479
Yeah, I learnt it in the '84 Bounce-Off
over at Laguna Beach.

41:54.560 --> 41:58.519
- The one Mr T hosted.
- As a matter of fact it is. The same one.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.233
(chuckles nervously)

42:09.320 --> 42:11.276
Wow!

42:11.360 --> 42:13.396
Whoopsie-daisy.

42:14.160 --> 42:18.312
I was looking for my brother, Al
Donnelly. He's around here somewhere.

42:19.320 --> 42:23.108
So you fellas are... performers or...

42:26.040 --> 42:28.918
Oh, no, thanks. I never touch the stuff.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.436
There's enough in the air here
to get everybody high.

42:33.520 --> 42:37.752
Besides, it gives you the munchies.
God knows, I don't need that. Hey!

42:41.040 --> 42:43.429
But, uh...

42:43.520 --> 42:46.796
(emcee) Rock The Vote
presents Mudhoney.

43:03.680 --> 43:07.195
I don't think these kids wanna hear me
talk about bond issues, man.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.872
Al, we are lucky to be here.

43:08.960 --> 43:13.715
Just go out, tell the kids to vote,
do an interview with some MTV person

43:13.800 --> 43:15.756
and we're outta here.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.159
All right.

43:32.680 --> 43:36.639
# Like stacks and stacks of rats on rafts

43:36.720 --> 43:39.473
# Clutchin' anything we can

43:39.560 --> 43:42.677
# Stacks and stacks of rats on rafts

43:42.760 --> 43:45.911
# Weight of the world
crushin' our backs

43:46.320 --> 43:48.356
# Tooth for a tooth

43:49.440 --> 43:51.829
# Eye for an eye

43:52.880 --> 43:54.871
# You know it's the truth

43:55.880 --> 43:59.270
# And this is why

43:59.880 --> 44:03.953
So he says "Rectum?
Damn near killed him!"

44:11.440 --> 44:13.715
I love you guys.

44:13.800 --> 44:15.791
This is fun.

44:16.840 --> 44:20.753
So anyway, what you're saying,

44:20.840 --> 44:24.150
I'm the Man, "Whitey",

44:24.600 --> 44:32.075
and you guys are the victims of
a tyrannical, racist, oppressive society?

44:32.160 --> 44:33.991
That's right, man.

44:34.360 --> 44:36.351
Man, that sucks!

44:39.080 --> 44:41.878
I'm gonna talk to some people
and straighten this out,

44:41.960 --> 44:44.633
cos this is a bunch of bullcrap!

44:44.720 --> 44:47.917
- All right?
- Yeah!

44:48.000 --> 44:51.470
- I'm gonna go get 'em.
- Kick ass, Whitey!

44:57.320 --> 45:00.949
- So when do I go on?
- Six, seven minutes. Just relax.

45:01.040 --> 45:03.474
- All right, all right.
- Straighten your tie.

45:03.560 --> 45:06.358
- Should I lose the tie?
- Loosen the tie.

45:06.440 --> 45:09.079
Just take it down. Take it down.

45:16.720 --> 45:19.188
Yeah!

45:21.160 --> 45:23.515
All right!

45:23.600 --> 45:25.113
Whoo!

45:25.200 --> 45:28.317
Yeah, man! I love you guys!

45:28.400 --> 45:31.437
- Whoa, whoa. Hang on. All right.
- Excellent!

45:31.520 --> 45:34.353
- What's your name?
- Mike Donnelly.

45:35.160 --> 45:38.118
Governor Donnelly? Nice threads.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.351
- No, you jag, he ain't the governor.
- He's runnin'for governor.

45:41.440 --> 45:45.558
- Well, get on out there!
- No! No! You got the wrong guy.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.995
Just a second. Fellas, come on.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.631
Uh...

46:03.680 --> 46:05.352
Um...

46:05.440 --> 46:08.193
I'm not supposed to be here. Uh...

46:13.120 --> 46:15.873
God. What is this?

46:18.480 --> 46:20.311
l, uh...

46:20.400 --> 46:23.995
I could sure use some cupcakes
or peanut-butter cups about now!

46:24.080 --> 46:26.719
- (riotous cheering)
- Yeah!

46:26.800 --> 46:30.554
- You know what that's about!
- (whoops of approval)

46:30.640 --> 46:34.315
So I guess you guys should vote,
you know, because...

46:34.400 --> 46:37.312
voting kicks ass, right? Yeah!

46:38.160 --> 46:43.837
And let me tell you, if you're gonna vote,
why not vote for Al Donnelly, right?

46:43.920 --> 46:46.115
(cheering)

46:48.400 --> 46:50.630
(synchronised drumrolls)

46:53.360 --> 46:56.796
Cos if voting kicks ass...

46:56.880 --> 46:59.235
What in the hell...

46:59.320 --> 47:00.992
Oh, please, God, I'm dreaming.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.515
...you've got some kick-ass shit!

47:09.080 --> 47:12.117
Oh, God. I'm a dead man. Oh!

47:12.200 --> 47:15.317
I'm hyperventilating... Oh! Oh!

47:17.440 --> 47:19.829
Cos I was born in the USA.

47:22.120 --> 47:24.190
(shouts of "Yeah!")

47:26.400 --> 47:30.678
You gotta fight for your right to vote.

47:40.160 --> 47:44.358
That's one small step for man,
one giant...

47:45.920 --> 47:48.309
- I have a dream!
- (cheering)

47:55.000 --> 47:56.911
Power to the people!

48:01.760 --> 48:03.796
Burn <i>, </i> baby <i>, </i> burn!

48:03.880 --> 48:05.518
Oh, Mike!

48:07.400 --> 48:09.391
Hey, fellas. Yeah.

48:10.280 --> 48:12.077
Kill Whitey!

48:12.160 --> 48:13.957
(stunned silence)

48:15.440 --> 48:17.874
No! No! No!

48:21.560 --> 48:25.394
- What in the hell were you thinking?
- I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk to you.

48:25.480 --> 48:29.553
- Oh, yeah. "Sorry."
- And I don't know how it happened.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.438
- I just got thrown on stage.
- Why couldn't you stay put?

48:32.520 --> 48:35.432
I told you I would
take care of everything.

48:35.520 --> 48:37.954
But, no, we get "Kill Whitey"?!

48:38.920 --> 48:43.152
I can't believe I have to ask you this, but
are you trying to screw this up for me?

48:43.240 --> 48:45.435
What is this? Do you want me to lose?

48:46.200 --> 48:52.673
If I really thought you believed that,
I'd just... I'd wanna die.

48:57.320 --> 48:59.788
Just stay outta the way.

48:59.880 --> 49:01.836
OK?

49:16.680 --> 49:20.639
Are you or are you not
the Black Angel of Death?

49:20.720 --> 49:23.154
Without question.

49:23.240 --> 49:25.959
Don't agree with me.
It just pisses me off more.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.231
It's over. It's finished.

49:31.600 --> 49:34.592
Talking about your brother's
election hopes or my career?

49:35.200 --> 49:39.398
The person I care about
most in my life... hates me.

49:41.400 --> 49:44.392
I'm not a brother.
I'm an embarrassment.

50:00.480 --> 50:04.792
- So what do you wanna do today?
- I don't care. Whatever you want.

50:06.120 --> 50:08.918
Man, I wish we could watch
your brother's debate on TV.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.594
That's today? We gotta watch it.

50:11.680 --> 50:14.478
How, by hooking a hanger up
to the metal plate in your head?

50:14.800 --> 50:18.509
I know a place with a TV. I saw it
when we were putting up posters.

50:18.680 --> 50:20.671
It's not far from here. Let's go.

50:27.400 --> 50:31.359
- Here it is.
- Of course. This had to be the place.

50:31.440 --> 50:35.911
How could you have such horrible
instincts and survive this long?

50:36.000 --> 50:40.391
- Looks like nobody's home.
- Yeah, I met this guy. Nobody is home.

50:41.320 --> 50:42.878
Ooh!

50:42.960 --> 50:44.188
Agh!

50:44.800 --> 50:46.791
Run!

50:47.400 --> 50:50.039
(Mike) Come on! Move it! Move it!

50:50.120 --> 50:52.793
This guy's got
a hell of a security system.

50:56.720 --> 50:59.518
Ready to start filming, Mr Stone.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.152
Really.

51:02.240 --> 51:07.234
My God, this guy is like Leatherface,
Chucky and Jan Brady rolled into one.

51:09.040 --> 51:10.632
Eegh.

51:11.200 --> 51:14.317
(Mike) "Honourable discharge.
Drake Sabitch."

51:14.400 --> 51:16.675
This must be his dad, Norris Sabitch.

51:19.640 --> 51:22.234
And his Grandpappy Winston.

51:23.880 --> 51:28.078
If he'd bought a smaller TV, he could've
afforded a couch with less urine on it.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.957
Yeah.

51:31.640 --> 51:36.430
I want to see a Washington where
children can walk down streets safely <i>, </i>

51:36.520 --> 51:41.116
where people can leave doors unlocked
and their minds are free from fear.

51:41.680 --> 51:45.070
This is one area where I'm in
total agreement with Governor Tracy.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.511
In fact <i>, </i> I agreed with that statement

51:47.600 --> 51:50.990
when she made it in her first campaign
for governor eight years ago.

51:51.360 --> 51:54.477
Man. My bro is knockin'
the snot outta her.

51:54.760 --> 51:59.276
- I'm gonna go take a squeege.
- Watch your step.

52:13.960 --> 52:17.919
If you really wanna understand
Mr Donnelly's view on family values <i>, </i>

52:18.000 --> 52:21.436
take a look at his brother
and ask yourself this question:

52:21.520 --> 52:24.432
"How far does
the acorn fall from the tree?"

52:24.520 --> 52:26.795
Or should I say "nut"?

52:26.880 --> 52:28.552
(laughter)

52:30.760 --> 52:34.992
Yes <i>, </i> my brother has some problems <i>, </i>
but who doesn't?

52:35.080 --> 52:38.709
And I just wanna say
I love my brother Mike.

52:39.880 --> 52:42.030
And I am very proud of him.

52:42.120 --> 52:45.635
And I believe that Mike's problems
are rather modest

- Ah. Ooh.

52:59.880 --> 53:03.668
- Agh! Oh!
- You're in the wrong zone, soldier boy.

53:03.760 --> 53:06.593
What the hell are you doin'
in my perimeter?

53:06.680 --> 53:08.875
Um, sir, I'm not a soldier.

53:09.200 --> 53:12.795
And I don't know if you read in USA
Today last week, but the war is over.

53:13.120 --> 53:16.715
You can punch out now,
move on, let it go.

53:17.720 --> 53:19.711
Who told you that?

53:20.520 --> 53:21.953
Charlie.

Um, I just talked to Charlie,
and he's not mad at you any more.

53:25.480 --> 53:29.314
So let's call off Operation "One of us
is Crazy" and go our separate ways.

53:29.400 --> 53:31.834

- Ow.

53:31.920 --> 53:34.115

53:34.200 --> 53:37.988

to dispatch you with extreme prejudice.

Sir, honestly, I just came back
to get my rental car and an apology.

53:44.520 --> 53:49.594
And if I could get that, I will gladly
leave your... coordinates here.

- Uh-huh.

53:57.520 --> 54:00.034
- Is that all?
- (chuckles nervously) That's all.

54:07.480 --> 54:09.471
Why didn't you tell me?

54:10.440 --> 54:14.069
- God! Here's the keys.
- Oh, thank you.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.472
And here's my apology.

54:18.680 --> 54:19.874

or I can explode your heart.

never happened in the first place.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.949
Donnelly had a smart-ass comment
to make after everything I said.

55:24.040 --> 55:27.999
It doesn't matter. I can't wait to see the
look on his face when he goes down.

55:28.080 --> 55:32.039
With all deference, Governor,
if he goes down.

55:32.120 --> 55:36.671

our people think will be very high.

know who to make out the cheque to.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.873
- Oh, man!
- What a goon.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.713
You were great though, man.
That was genius.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.439
I never would've thought of that.
That was hot.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.112
- Whoo!
- (sirens)

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.191
Oh, shit!

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.875
Oh, man. I hope there's
enough juice left in these boosters.

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.191
- Yeah!
- Whoa!

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:22.872
Whoo!

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.312
See ya.

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:29.995
Oh, man! Whoo!

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.111
We're live at the governor's mansion.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.193
Today is a celebration of Governor
Tracy's election to a third term,

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:08.232
with all the campaign staff and their
families gathering for a festive affair.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.707
Governor Tracy, having just pulled out
a squeaker, must be all smiles today.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.036
We're just receiving word
that Mike Donnelly <i>, </i> brother of Al <i>, </i>

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.111
is involved in a police pursuit.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:26.037
Mike Donnelly is driving down Capitol
Boulevard in a stolen police car.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.997
I don't believe this.
Driver, head back to the capital.

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.877
- What? You can't do this.
- Do what?

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.791
Commit career suicide.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.509
I beg you, don't do this. Give me
some time. I can make you a senator.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:42.116
Jesus. Did it ever occur to you family
may be more important than career?

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:45.710
Ever occur to you that at some point
you'll have to make a choice

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.029
between me and your loser brother?

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.353
Go and scope it out.
Nobody's gonna recognise you.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.034
OK. Promise me you'll stay right here.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.549
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:31.509
This election was about
the majesty of democracy,

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.549
where the gathered masses
held their vote high.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.232
(applause)

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:45.631
My re-election would not have been
possible without the people in this state

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.188
who supported me in this victory.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.397
I must also thank
my wonderful husband Dennis

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.597
and my two beautiful,
intelligent children...

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.797
Psst! Steve. I'm in.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.393
Where the hell's Drake?
He's supposed to be here.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:06.393
I'm surprised we can't count on a guy
whose bus is surrounded by mines.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.471
All right. Here's what we do.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:13.151
We dress as caterers, right?

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.074
Nobody looks at a caterer's face.
It's always "Whaddaya got in the tray?"

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.277
Then we sneak around back.
When Tracy starts to...

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.833
Something's happening here.
Steve, help.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.114
Steve.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.156
Steve, get back here.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.312
Oh, my God.
The damn thing's caught in my belt.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.039
God! Help, please!

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.911
- I can't...
- (gasps)

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.679
I can't... God!

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.389
- You in the band, help.
- Hello.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.277
Help!

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.433
God!

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.555
- Stay.
- Steve! Help.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.029
- How are you?
- Steve! Please!

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.554
Somebody! Somebody help me.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.995
Somebody help me!

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.959
Agh! Help!

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.918
The voters have spoken, and I have
heard their message loud and clear.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.560
- And that message is...
- (Mike) God! Help!

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.598
- Holy shit!
- (shocked gasps)

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.835
(laughs nervously)

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.635
Hi, there. Hi.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.957
Boy, I feel like a horse's patoot.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.599
l, uh...

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.036
Oh, no! For the love of God!

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.833
Aaaarrggh!

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.239
(groans)

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.198
I'm all right. I'm OK.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.748
Gimme a minute.
Gimme a minute. I'll be fine.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.070
Nobody move, or Steve Dodds gets it!

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.718
- Who?
- Steve Dodds.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.598
- Who's this guy?
- From the Donnelly campaign.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.399
What does it matter?
He's got a gun! You're a cop.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.109
Get over here. I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:11.432
- I want that asshole taken out.
- I'll get a sharpshooter on it right away.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.637
- Get your ass up there.
- Ow!

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.555
Everybody back up,
or I blow the pipsqueak's head off.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.790
I've got somethin' to say!

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.634
Please listen to him. Do what he says.
I have children. Tommy and Sally...

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.119
- Shut up!
- All right.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.954
You keep your mouth shut, squirt.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.508
As soon as you get a clear shot, take it.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.435
(Mike) OK, listen up.
This is serious business.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.155
Now, we've all been screwed
by Governor Tracy.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.549
And now I'm gonna screw her!

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.834
(shocked gasps)

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:52.756
I mean, I have evidence here you need
to know about now before it's too late.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.638
- Mike. Mike, what are you doing here?
- Oh, man.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.591
- Isn't that Steve Dodds?
- Uh, yes, sir.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:03.514
Al, man, I know what I'm doin'.
I'm gonna prove you won the election.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.717
Mike, put the gun down.
There's other ways to handle this.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.516
No, man! Al, there's no other way!
You gotta believe me.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.592
I believe you.
I just don't want you to get hurt.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.035
Look, I know this looks bad.
Al, man, I'm not a screwup on this one.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.759
I've got proof this time. Real proof.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.592
(Al) But the election's over. It's history.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.148
Like you're gonna be
if you don't put that gun down.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.629
Al, please!

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.234
If you love me like a brother,
you gotta back me up on this.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.915
All right, Mike. I'll back you up.
What do you want me to do?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.150
Just let me explain what happened.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.509
- Oh!
- (crowd scream)

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.039
That's it. Game over.
I'm not even getting paid for this.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.596
- This is not worth it.
- Look out. Look out. Look out.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.477
OK.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.271
(crowd scream)

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.878
Mr Thunder-maker here is gonna start
barkin' fire if you don't stop moving

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.520
and listen to what
this young man has to say.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.071
Go ahead, Mike. Clear.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.996
Thank you, sir. You've just met Drake
Sabitch, a great American soldier.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.356
I'd like to tell you about
some other great American soldiers.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.874
Drake Sabitch's grandfather,
Winston Sabitch,

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.918
whose name you'll find
at the top of this list.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.869
It says that he registered
and voted for Governor Tracy.

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.077
- We're proud to have him as a voter.
- Hold your tongue, wench.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.233
The fact is Winston Sabitch was killed
in the Argonne Forest in 1918.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:38.472
A zeppelin landed on his head,
smashing his head clean out of his ass.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.518
That's my granddad. Rest in pieces, sir.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.315
Norris Sabitch met his maker
in Iwo Jima, 1944.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:51.236
Nelson Sabitch was killed
near the 38th Parallel in Korea.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.110
But yesterday these men managed
to cast their vote for Evelyn Tracy.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.589
(disapproving murmurs)

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.148
You heard it here, folks. Voter fraud.

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:09.074
Half these people are buried in the
Garfield cemetery. That's one county.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.676
- It's probably the same statewide.
- Hold on just a minute, young fellow.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.673
There's a perfectly good explanation
for all of this. Neuschwander.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:24.197
Actually, there is a perfectly
good explanation for this.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.558
- She put us up to it.
- Would you shut up?!

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.437
- It's all her.
- Shut up!

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.077
Ladies and gentlemen,
this young man is a fine patriot.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.720
He deserves to be hoisted up
on our shoulders.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.360
- Sergeant, please. This isn't necessary.
- Come on.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.795
- Oh, you're a large American.
- Argh!

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.911
Get off of me.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:52.515
My foot's caught a little bit.
I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.639
- I'm asking you to get off me!
- Governor... I should say ex-governor!

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.518
I'm just trying to get
a little leverage on my foot.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.397
Agh!

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:07.475
- No, no, no! Please, somebody help me!
- Oh, man.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.551
(grunting)

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:15.678
- OK. Hi, how are ya?
- Somebody get him off of me!

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.317
For God's sakes.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.277
(grunting continues)

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.158
Shut up! Shut up!

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:33.680
Thanks, bro. At times in the campaign
I lost sight of what really mattered.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.196
- I never should have doubted you.
- Oh, thanks, man. It's cool.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.635
Are you sure
you don't want a job on my staff?

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.519
You know what, Al? I don't think
I'm really cut out for politics.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.239
Besides, I gotta rebuild that rec centre.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:50.198
- The kids really love the place, so...
- Yeah, I know.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:54.068
Hey, I got somebody you gotta meet.
Scott, come here a second.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:00.030
Check this kid out. He's got an arm
like you used to have. Hey, Scott.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.237
Hey. Mr Governor,
can I please have your autograph?

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.914
Why not? Governor elect.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.997
Get it right, moron.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.999
- There you go.
- Wow.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:14.038
Check this out.
Gimme a toss, Scott. Hey, buddy.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.917
Ooh!

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.549
Nice toss, Scott.
Oh, man, the kid's got a cannon.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.756
- Go long.
- OK.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.511
- Ow!
- Oh!

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.989
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- You OK?

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.793
- So long, little brother.
- OK. See you, Al.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.633
- So this is it, huh, Steve?
- I guess I'm gonna miss you.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:46.315
I'm not gonna miss a 9mm to my head,
but... What were you thinking?

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.595
I don't know.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.916
All right, you guys.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:04.197
Oh, my God! No! No!

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.316
Please don't take off!

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.152
Please!

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.549
Al! Al! No! No!

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.631
