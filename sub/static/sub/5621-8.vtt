00:18.452 --> 00:20.953
This Thanksgiving,
I have one thing

00:20.955 --> 00:22.654
that I am most thankful for.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.957
All of you, this firm.

00:24.959 --> 00:27.626
And my colleague, Avery Banks.

00:27.628 --> 00:31.497
You inspire me...
every single day.

00:31.499 --> 00:35.968
And I am thankful
for you, Mitch.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.504
For the way you handle
yourself in that courtroom,

00:38.506 --> 00:39.972
but most of all,

00:39.974 --> 00:41.974
for the way you grind.

00:41.976 --> 00:44.043
Everyone, can we have the room?

00:44.045 --> 00:46.178
I need to debrief Ms. Banks.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.981
And let's just say we need to...

00:48.983 --> 00:51.850
<i>probe...</i> for some testimony.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.053
Let's just say
that the<i> probing...</i>

00:54.055 --> 00:56.989
could take quite some time.

00:56.991 --> 00:59.324
And let's just say that...

00:59.326 --> 01:02.961
quite some time...
could be all night.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.333
Happy Thanksgiving, Ms. Banks.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.169
Happy Thanksgiving...

01:10.171 --> 01:14.073
Mr... Grinder.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.541
MAN:
Cut!

01:15.543 --> 01:17.009
(bell rings)
WOMAN:
That's a cut.

01:17.011 --> 01:19.111
Dean, what are you doing?
You're supposed to walk

01:19.113 --> 01:21.413
toward Avery,
take off your shirt,

01:21.415 --> 01:23.582
then kiss, sweep the table
and start boning her.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.784
That's what it
says in my script.
I was thinking

01:25.786 --> 01:27.719
maybe we'd just do this scene
with my shirt on.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.022
Why?
Yeah, that feels weird.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.057
Does it? Really?
It's a Thanksgiving episode.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.926
Shouldn't this really
be more about

01:33.928 --> 01:35.427
how well we all work together

01:35.429 --> 01:37.196
and that we're like
a real family?

01:37.198 --> 01:39.031
Well, that's in there.
It's the first part.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.399
You don't think it cheapens it?

01:40.401 --> 01:41.867
Dean, you're a sex symbol.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.402
You're the friggin' Grinder.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.304
(laughing):
Come on.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.738
Let's, uh...
(patting)

01:46.740 --> 01:48.640
Let's not overthink this.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.309
Let's, uh, take it off.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.946
Let's, let's give the people
what they want, huh?

01:57.918 --> 01:59.598
MAN (in distance):
Watch the table, please.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.387
Yes.

02:02.389 --> 02:03.956
There he is!

02:03.958 --> 02:05.491
All right, let's reset!

02:05.493 --> 02:07.292
Ericka, could you spritz down
the turkey?

02:07.294 --> 02:09.094
It's starting to lose its shine.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.797
Ericka, could you give me
a spritz?

02:11.799 --> 02:14.600
Because I have<i> also</i>
lost my shine.

02:14.602 --> 02:17.102
What?

02:17.104 --> 02:19.171
¶ ¶

02:21.575 --> 02:22.808
LIZZIE:
<i>Mom, can I go</i>

02:22.810 --> 02:24.776
to Amanda's tomorrow?
Sure, sweetie.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.245
I'm gonna need to piggyback
on that ride.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.347
Brie needs me at her place
by 5:00 at the latest.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.948
Oh, does she?
Does she need you?
STEWART: I can

02:29.950 --> 02:32.251
take you on the way to the lake.
Hey, you guys want to come?

02:32.253 --> 02:34.353
Yeah, I'm in.
I'm sorry, what's happening?

02:34.355 --> 02:36.955
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Did no one here notice that?

02:36.957 --> 02:38.490
We don't really do
Thanksgiving anymore.
Yeah.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.492
You don't do Thanksgiving?
STEWART:
No.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.761
What does that even mean?
Well, you know,
ever since Mom and Dad

02:42.763 --> 02:45.097
got divorced, instead of
fighting over who goes where,

02:45.099 --> 02:47.366
we do kind of a...
a family-free day.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.469
Everyone gets to do
what they want. It's easier.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.304
It's what now?
Just easier.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.106
I'm-I'm not familiar
with the term.
Here we go.

02:54.108 --> 02:55.874
Oh, sure you are, Dean. You know
how, like, instead of going

02:55.876 --> 02:57.709
to law school and taking the
bar, you just became a lawyer?

02:57.711 --> 03:00.179
You know, we always want to take
the easy way out, don't we?

03:00.181 --> 03:02.447
Was it easy for our forefathers
to board the<i> Mayflower,</i>

03:02.449 --> 03:04.716
navigate the English Channel,
and get rid of whoever the hell

03:04.718 --> 03:06.218
was already over here
to start America?

03:06.220 --> 03:07.853
No!
No.
None of those things are true.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.989
Damn right it wasn't.
This holiday

03:10.991 --> 03:12.858
is about respecting

03:12.860 --> 03:15.561
and honoring those brave souls

03:15.563 --> 03:17.362
who didn't just stop and say,

03:17.364 --> 03:20.199
"You know what? I'm not getting
on the boat today, guys.

03:20.201 --> 03:23.702
Staying behind...
because it's easier."

03:23.704 --> 03:25.137
DEAN SR.:
Maybe he's right, Stew.

03:25.139 --> 03:27.005
Maybe we should try
Thanksgiving again.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.073
Like we used to do it.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.241
Yes, with the Yaos,

03:29.243 --> 03:30.509
the delightful Asian family.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.377
Who?
Joseph T. Yao.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.046
My old partner.

03:34.048 --> 03:36.682
Yeah, sweetie, you're too young
to remember, but

03:36.684 --> 03:37.749
we used to have every

03:37.751 --> 03:38.751
Thanksgiving with them.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.052
Why did they stop coming?

03:40.054 --> 03:41.720
Because your brother
shut down Thanksgiving.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.389
No, Dad, I didn't
shut down Thanksgiving.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.658
Well, I say we start it up
again. Come on, who's with me?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.594
I'm in.
LIZZIE:
Yes!

03:48.596 --> 03:50.662
Yes! Motion carried.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.531
So, Thanksgiving's just
happening now.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.032
That-That's all it took? Dean
wants to celebrate the crossing

03:54.034 --> 03:56.368
of the English Channel?
All right, take it easy.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.170
I can't take it easy, honey. The
pilgrims didn't take it easy.

03:58.172 --> 03:59.771
Weren't you listening?
I was, thank you.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.173
I mean, he doesn't want
to take the easy way.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.674
His whole life
has been the easy way.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.576
Honey, I think it's time
you tell Dean the truth.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.278
Deb, don't. Please.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.879
It's gonna make you feel better.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.548
Dean deserves to know
why you hate Thanksgiving.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.216
You can't keep this bottled up.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.884
Oh, I can keep this
bottled up. You'd be amazed

04:12.886 --> 04:15.554
the things I can
keep bottled up.
Okay, honey, look.

04:15.556 --> 04:16.888
I can't be the only
other person who knows.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.423
Now, either you're gonna
tell your brother,

04:18.425 --> 04:20.192
or I'm gonna tell him.
Fine, you tell him.

04:20.194 --> 04:21.927
I'll call your bluff.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.262
Okay, no.
I think you should tell him.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.863
You folded very fast
right there.
I'm not folding.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.199
I'm just saying, you need
to be the one who tells him.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.301
I'm not gonna tell him, Deb.
Honey, it's gonna
make you feel better.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.637
Talking to Dean rarely
makes me feel better.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.739
DEAN:
<i>It's so good to see your face.</i>

04:33.741 --> 04:35.874
STEWART: Hey!
Thanksgiving is

04:35.876 --> 04:37.709
such an emotional time for me.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.378
It's September.
Yes, but

04:39.380 --> 04:40.946
we shoot
the Thanksgiving episode now,

04:40.948 --> 04:43.949
so, to me, it feels like
Thanksgiving. You get it.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.118
Yeah, completely.
Hi! Hi, Dean!

04:46.120 --> 04:48.720
Hey! There she is!

04:48.722 --> 04:50.155
Hey, did your brother
tell you his big news?

04:50.157 --> 04:51.757
No, hon, it's not big news.
He's not gonna...

04:51.759 --> 04:53.158
It is big news. Don't
let him tell you that.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.960
I'm so proud of him.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.262
I drafted a petition
and gave it to the city council,

04:57.264 --> 04:59.564
and they signed the ordinance,
so there's now gonna be

04:59.566 --> 05:01.466
a protected left-hand turn
at the corner of 14th and Cedar.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.901
Isn't that incredible?!

05:02.903 --> 05:05.771
I'm sorry. What?
A protected left?

05:05.773 --> 05:08.340
Stew, you are actually
saving people's lives.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.808
I mean, think about

05:09.810 --> 05:11.243
how many people died
at that intersection.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.412
Well, none so far...

05:13.414 --> 05:15.180
And now,
thanks to you, none will.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.082
It's so damn inspiring.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.618
Oh, kids, come say hi.
Come say hi. Look who's here!

05:19.620 --> 05:22.254
ETHAN: Hi, Uncle Dean.
Oh, there they are!

05:22.256 --> 05:24.523
Uncle Dean, last week's episode
was heartbreaking.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.658
Thank you. Getting some
good buzz on that one.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.260
Hey, Ethan, tell me,

05:28.262 --> 05:31.196
how's that prepubescent stuff
going for you?

05:31.198 --> 05:33.365
Powering through it.
Yeah, you are.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.934
Man, I'm missing so much.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.269
Dean, they're ready

05:37.271 --> 05:39.137
for the scene
where you take your shirt off,

05:39.139 --> 05:40.706
then cross-examine
the vice president.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.641
STEWART: Dean, you're naked
with the vice president?

05:42.643 --> 05:44.343
Sounds like an exciting scene.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.811
Yeah, yeah.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.612
It's not real, is it?

05:47.614 --> 05:49.948
Are you asking me?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.516
Dean, we're<i> ready</i> ready.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.617
DEBBIE:
Sorry, honey.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.952
Yeah, okay, great, um...

05:53.954 --> 05:55.354
(Stewart continues indistinctly)

05:58.225 --> 06:00.292
Here, you're good, good to go.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.127
STEWART:
So this is

06:02.129 --> 06:04.963
fully happening?
Oh, it is happening.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.531
We got three stations.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.367
I'm bouncing back and forth
between all of 'em.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.068
You want to get in on this?
Uh, I'm good.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.137
Think I'm just gonna
go watch the game.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.872
Honey?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.474
Maybe Dean wants to go with you.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.043
You guys could watch football
and talk...?

06:18.045 --> 06:22.714
No, no. No, don't want to...
don't want to break up the flow.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.317
ANNOUNCER:
East to west, 15 miles an hour,

06:25.319 --> 06:27.085
partly cloudy.
(clears throat)

06:27.087 --> 06:29.354
Beautiful day for football here
on Thanksgiving.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.056
(sighs)

06:31.058 --> 06:34.126
So, it'll be second down
and six to go.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.662
Talk to me.
Nothing to talk about.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.165
I just... just don't like
this holiday, that's all.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.667
This is about
Mom, isn't it?
(scoffs)
What? No.

06:42.669 --> 06:45.904
I had no idea that you were
taking the divorce this hard.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.907
I mean, you have clearly
suffered a major trauma.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.443
Dean, you are a fake lawyer,
not a fake psychologist.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.111
Mm, and now you're
lashing out at me.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.414
It's much worse
than I thought.
Oh, my God.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.849
But I have something that's
gonna cheer you up and make this

06:57.851 --> 06:59.918
feel like an old-school
Sanderson Thanksgiving.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.289
Wow, this I can't wait for.
Joseph T. Yao will
be here any minute.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.391
What? You invited Yao?
Yeah.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.460
Well, I invited his whole
family, but he's the only one

07:08.462 --> 07:10.061
who could make it.
Oh, my God, Dean,

07:10.063 --> 07:11.863
why'd you do this?
You don't listen. You just

07:11.865 --> 07:14.766
don't listen. You just insist
on doing whatever you want.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.234
There's a reason I didn't
want to do any of this!

07:16.236 --> 07:17.803
Well, then, tell me.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.471
What's the point, Dean?
You're not gonna listen.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.872
I will not let you
walk away from this.
You will

07:20.874 --> 07:22.073
let me walk away from this.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.275
You will tell me
what's going on.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.143
You can't handle
what's going on.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.878
Don't tell me what
I can't handle.
Then handle this.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.320
Five years ago, I caught Mom and
Yao together on Thanksgiving.

07:29.483 --> 07:30.982
Together.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.651
(doorbell rings)

07:32.653 --> 07:33.952
(door opens)

07:33.954 --> 07:35.887
DEAN SR.:
Holy cow, it's Joe Yao!

07:41.295 --> 07:43.829
DEAN SR.: Hey, boys.
A blast from the past.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.831
Stewart! Junior!

07:45.833 --> 07:48.099
(chuckles)
Long time.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.267
Hello.
Yao.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.735
STEWART:
Hey, honey!

07:50.737 --> 07:52.003
Uh, come see who's here!

07:53.140 --> 07:55.006
Yao.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.308
Wow.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.176
Exactly.
I'm gonna go.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.412
Oh, you don't want to say?
Well, I'm-I'm feeling
a little not well.

08:00.414 --> 08:03.448
Oh, now that your big
surprise is here, you're
not feeling so well? Really?

08:03.450 --> 08:06.585
He's not feeling well, Stew.
Let the poor guy go lay down.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.619
Thank you, Dad.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.489
Y-You guys just...
catch up.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.263
Dean, I'm not doing this today.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.965
"Mitch rips off his shirt

08:19.967 --> 08:21.967
and sweeps off a
room service cart"?

08:21.969 --> 08:23.502
I mean, come on, man.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.670
What are we doing?
This isn't our show.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.339
Yeah.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.840
Talk to me.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.009
What's going on?
(sighs)

08:31.011 --> 08:33.378
I don't know, I'm
just feeling stuck.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.313
You don't even know
what stuck is.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.015
When<i> you've</i> run aground

08:37.017 --> 08:39.117
on one of the lesser
tributaries of the Nile,

08:39.119 --> 08:41.686
then you can talk to<i> me</i>
about stuck.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.488
Now, come on.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.689
Man up!

08:44.691 --> 08:45.991
I talked to my brother.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.158
He's doing

08:47.160 --> 08:48.393
<i>real</i> things...

08:48.395 --> 08:50.195
that affect<i> real</i> people.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.963
You remember when
we used to that?

08:51.965 --> 08:54.199
And we told stories
that mattered?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.868
Dean, the ratings
are higher than ever.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.137
The TV landscape has changed.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.739
People are watching
on phones and watches.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.574
No one's paying attention
to the story.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.975
Well, we shouldn't
give up on them.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.243
They deserve better.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.678
It shouldn't just be
about what shirt

09:06.680 --> 09:08.013
I'm ripping off
and who I'm boning.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.214
You are really hung up

09:09.216 --> 09:10.715
on this shirt-ripping thing.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.817
You want to come into more
scenes already shirtless?

09:12.819 --> 09:14.986
You want to skip
the, the ripping part?
Is that what you're saying?

09:14.988 --> 09:16.721
No, that's-that's
not what I'm saying.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.723
I'm saying I want to do
more episodes with meaning.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.258
Like we used to.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.727
Abortion. Gun control.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.696
College campus rape.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.399
Those are the scenes
I want to do again.

09:27.401 --> 09:31.002
And I want to keep my
shirt<i> on</i> through them.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.203
I'll tell you what.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.705
We'll shoot it both ways.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.440
Shirt on, shirt off...
Then we have an option.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.709
But you're only gonna use the
takes where my shirt is off.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.244
I will not.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.912
We will make
the decision together.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.748
We will watch the footage,
and<i> we</i> will decide

09:43.750 --> 09:47.552
what works best for the scene...
and the story.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.454
Do I have your word?

09:49.456 --> 09:50.655
Dean.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.058
This is Cliff Bemis

09:53.060 --> 09:54.459
you're talking to,

09:54.461 --> 09:56.261
and Cliff Bemis is nothing...

09:56.263 --> 09:58.930
without his word.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.441
Dean, are you okay?

10:09.443 --> 10:11.142
STEWART: You got your
feet on the pillows.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.711
I need to know what happened.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.412
No, Dean, you really don't.
(groans)

10:14.414 --> 10:15.880
Tell me...

10:15.882 --> 10:17.782
what it was...

10:17.784 --> 10:19.417
you saw.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.386
Honey, you might want
to step out.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.588
I'm about to go
into some graphic detail

10:23.590 --> 10:25.790
I've never even told you.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.093
Well, then I'm
definitely gonna stay.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.494
(sighs)

10:30.464 --> 10:32.097
(door closes)

10:32.099 --> 10:34.099
It was Thanksgiving,

10:34.101 --> 10:35.467
2009.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.002
Mom got a headache
from the Chardonnay

10:37.004 --> 10:38.570
so she went to lie down.

10:38.572 --> 10:41.272
I went upstairs
to check on her, and...

10:41.274 --> 10:43.775
that's when I saw
your bedroom door cracked open.

10:43.777 --> 10:47.245
My God, they were having
sex in my childhood bed?

10:47.247 --> 10:50.482
It was worse...
they were<i> next</i>
to your childhood bed.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.183
Why is<i> that</i> worse?
Why is that worse?

10:52.185 --> 10:53.518
Because they were standing.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.586
Well...

10:54.588 --> 10:55.920
Mom was.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.689
What was Yao doing?

10:57.691 --> 10:58.857
He was upside down.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.592
I don't understand.

11:00.594 --> 11:01.693
Think about it.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.828
Visualize it.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.665
Ugh.
Ew. No.
No, thank you.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.601
It was disturbing.
And Mom was strong enough to...?

11:09.603 --> 11:12.437
Yeah, she was.
Oh, yeah. No, she got really
into CrossFit that year.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.639
Her upper arms were,
like, ka-pow!

11:14.641 --> 11:16.007
DEAN:
I feel sick.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.275
Did they see you?

11:17.277 --> 11:18.510
No. They were...

11:18.512 --> 11:20.645
(exhales)
too consumed.

11:20.647 --> 11:24.049
And Dad is sitting
downstairs right now

11:24.051 --> 11:27.318
having beers with that
man in our house!

11:27.320 --> 11:29.020
It's my house.
Well, it's also my house, too.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.455
It's all our houses
except for you.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.823
He has to know.
No.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.558
Dean, nothing good can come

11:33.560 --> 11:35.226
from Dad knowing about this.
We're not telling him.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.829
That's right.
We are not telling him.
No.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.330
You are.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.166
No, I'm not!
Honey,
I actually think

11:41.168 --> 11:42.534
that's a really good
idea, because it's

11:42.536 --> 11:44.035
not good for you
to keep this inside.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.537
Nope.
It's bad for
your health.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.638
It's not good
for his health.
Mm-mm.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.006
He's-he's all constricted.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.240
Yeah.
And he can barely breathe.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.508
I breathe very, very well.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.177
You are going to tell him.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.646
And then you're gonna confront
that coward Yao.

11:54.648 --> 11:56.314
That Yao-ward.
Is that something?

11:56.316 --> 11:58.249
No. That's nothing.
Dean, please stop.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.751
All right? We're not gonna
tell anybody, we're not

11:59.753 --> 12:01.252
gonna confront anybody,
we're just gonna continue

12:01.254 --> 12:03.421
hiding the truth from Dad
for the rest of our lives.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.923
That is not in the
Thanksgiving spirit.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.925
Dean! What do you know
about the Thanksgiving spirit?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.359
I know everything about
the Thanksgiving spirit.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.662
I played Sacagawea!
For Lifetime!

12:10.664 --> 12:12.731
All right, you guys can have
whatever Thanksgiving you want.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.432
You're just gonna do it
without me.

12:15.669 --> 12:17.502
(both sigh heavily)

12:23.744 --> 12:25.243
DEBBIE: Oh.
Ah, thanks, Dean,

12:25.245 --> 12:26.444
Some greens for you,

12:26.446 --> 12:28.580
sweetie.
Thanks, Mama. Where's Dad?

12:28.582 --> 12:30.682
He is, um... not feeling well.

12:30.684 --> 12:32.050
Dean, you weren't
feeling well, either.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.418
Is there something going around?

12:33.420 --> 12:36.688
Yes. Something is
definitely going around.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.423
Mm.
But we should, um...

12:38.425 --> 12:40.725
go ahead and get started.
Oh, uh, wait,

12:40.727 --> 12:42.460
at Amanda's house, we all
hold hands and say what we're

12:42.462 --> 12:45.130
thankful for.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Let's try that.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.799
DEAN SR.:
Why don't you go first, Joe?
You're the guest.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.034
YAO:
Oh, okay, uh, let's see. Well,

12:50.036 --> 12:51.536
I'm thankful to be here today.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.637
I always really enjoyed

12:52.639 --> 12:55.173
Thanksgiving at your house.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.509
Really enjoyed it.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.378
Lots of good times here.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.613
DEAN SR.:
Well, I'm thankful

13:01.615 --> 13:03.248
for all of this.
Having Thanksgiving

13:03.250 --> 13:04.816
with the family again,

13:04.818 --> 13:05.950
my son is back,

13:05.952 --> 13:07.619
my old partner's back,

13:07.621 --> 13:09.020
my old...
Stop.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.556
Something's not right.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.325
Thanksgiving is about family,
and something is missing.

13:18.899 --> 13:19.964
Where are you going?

13:19.966 --> 13:23.067
To find my brother.

13:23.069 --> 13:26.137
Because I know how
lost he is right now.

13:27.741 --> 13:30.008
<i>(waves crashing)</i>

13:30.010 --> 13:31.650
(on video):
Happy Thanksgiving, Ms. Banks.

13:34.748 --> 13:37.215
You got to be kidding me!

13:40.153 --> 13:41.686
Dean?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.958
Hey, Timothy.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.427
You okay, bro?

13:49.429 --> 13:51.496
What are you doing out here?

13:51.498 --> 13:53.832
Just trying
to figure it all out.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.967
Yeah, well...

13:55.969 --> 13:58.703
this is the place to do it, huh?

13:58.705 --> 14:01.706
He used the shirtless take
without consulting me.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.275
They always do.

14:04.277 --> 14:08.346
You didn't fall for the
"let's shoot it both
ways" thing, did you?

14:09.783 --> 14:12.050
I'm afraid I did.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.319
Little trick
for next time...
if you're doing

14:14.321 --> 14:16.187
a take you don't
want them to use,

14:16.189 --> 14:18.323
just leave the tiniest bit
of your penis showing.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.659
They can't use it.
They<i> can't</i> use it.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.795
Bemis knows the trick.

14:23.797 --> 14:24.963
I've tried it.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.664
It sounds like Bemis...

14:26.666 --> 14:29.367
is turning you into
something you're not.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.836
The man is objectifying you.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.571
You are an actor.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.206
You're not a piece of meat.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.742
You can't just
take your shirt off.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.744
Unless it's...

14:39.746 --> 14:41.412
Justified?

14:41.414 --> 14:42.981
Dean, listen to me.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.683
You cannot let another man
own your dignity.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.218
Because if another man owns it,

14:47.220 --> 14:49.554
at best, you're leasing it.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.489
And that lease rate...

14:51.491 --> 14:54.726
it's astronomical, brother.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.060
So what do I do?

14:56.062 --> 14:57.528
You take it back.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.664
You walk away.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.500
You gotta follow
your bliss, bro.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.903
Bliss-bro.
Is that something?

15:04.905 --> 15:06.437
For what?

15:06.439 --> 15:09.040
I don't even know anymore.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.209
Dean, the answers

15:11.211 --> 15:13.177
are not out there.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.847
They're in here... brother.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.216
And you can find them...

15:18.218 --> 15:21.119
with your shirt on.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.257
Dude, you are so dialed in.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.866
(knocking)

15:34.868 --> 15:36.534
Dean, I just want
to be left alone.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.736
What?!
I just want to be left alone.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.305
I...
(rattling)

15:40.307 --> 15:41.472
(sighs)

15:44.377 --> 15:46.477
That is not an option.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.413
Thanksgiving is hanging on
by a thread in there,

15:48.415 --> 15:49.814
and you're the only one
who can save it.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.282
I just want it to be over.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.951
But it's not going to be over
until you face this.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.252
Dad needs to know

15:54.254 --> 15:56.454
and Yao needs to go.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.790
Dean, I feel like this could
work out. You know?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.825
We just do nothing,
let it blow over,

16:00.827 --> 16:01.826
in a couple hours,
everything's back to normal.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.261
But it's not normal.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.764
I remember a little boy
who loved Thanksgiving.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.132
It was his favorite holiday.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.268
And Yao has stolen that
from you.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.637
He has stolen your family.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.605
And worst of all,

16:14.607 --> 16:18.209
he's stolen your dignity.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.646
Well... you had me
till the end there.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.614
I feel like I have my dignity.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.083
Nope, he owns it.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.085
Dean, I just can't talk
to Dad about this.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.186
I know, and-and
I'm scared, too.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.254
But I'll be right there
with you.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.123
Or we could just stay in this,

16:32.125 --> 16:36.327
hit the gas, get on that highway
and keep on driving.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.197
Till there's no more road left.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.467
AVERY:
<i>I think I know Mitch</i>

16:42.469 --> 16:44.669
better than anyone in this firm,

16:44.671 --> 16:48.940
and he will never stop grinding.

16:48.942 --> 16:50.975
DEAN:
Maybe that's where you're wrong.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.310
Cut!
WOMAN: That's a cut!

16:52.312 --> 16:54.112
(bell rings)
Dean, what the hell?

16:54.114 --> 16:55.680
We're in the middle of this.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.682
Or are we at the end of this?

16:57.684 --> 17:00.318
You used the shirtless take.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.954
All right, everybody, take five.

17:02.956 --> 17:05.356
I thought Cliff Bemis
was nothing without his word.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.158
Yeah, I-I texted you.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.460
"All shirtless, right?
No brainer."

17:09.462 --> 17:11.195
I received no such text.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.031
And part of me doesn't think
you even sent it.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.532
But even if you did,

17:14.534 --> 17:17.568
why would I have no shirt
in the law library?

17:17.570 --> 17:19.871
You had the whole love
story with the paralegal.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.572
Where else would that have gone?

17:21.574 --> 17:23.741
I did what was best
for the scene, Dean.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.877
Scene-Dean.
Is that something?
Could be.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.412
If you'd stop tying my hands

17:27.414 --> 17:29.647
with this whole
no-shirtless crap.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.748
Is that what grinding
means to you?

17:30.750 --> 17:32.817
Yes, it's what it
means to everybody.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.252
That's the fun of the title.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.586
The double meaning.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.221
Well, I guess I never
saw it that way.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.856
To me, it only had
one meaning...

17:38.858 --> 17:40.525
The relentless search
for justice

17:40.527 --> 17:42.693
and being willing to do
whatever it takes,

17:42.695 --> 17:44.529
no matter how hard the grind.

17:44.531 --> 17:45.763
All right, it's that crap, too.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.098
It's both.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.666
Well, it doesn't matter.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.635
Because I am done.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.739
The show is over.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.742
The show is over
when I say it's over.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.911
You think you're The Grinder?

17:59.913 --> 18:01.446
I'm The Grinder.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.581
I created him.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.685
Well, you may have created him,
but I brought him to life.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.021
I gave him a soul.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.957
I am taking back
my dignity, Cliff.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.625
I am done leasing it.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.795
And I'm willing to pay
whatever the price

18:17.797 --> 18:19.931
to own it once again.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.938
DEBBIE:
Does anyone need seconds?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.639
You guys save room for dessert?

18:28.641 --> 18:30.875
Oh.
There you are.

18:30.877 --> 18:31.909
Feeling better?

18:31.911 --> 18:34.645
Dad, Yao...

18:36.149 --> 18:37.882
we need to talk.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.487
And that's what I saw.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.822
Mom and Yao.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.390
Oh, wow.

18:46.392 --> 18:47.959
I'm sorry it took me so long
to tell you, Dad.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.494
And you're sure
that's what you saw?

18:49.496 --> 18:51.462
Yeah, I'm 100% sure.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.064
Wow.
Yao.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.966
I am embarrassed.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.134
Well, you should be.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.602
Lock a door, Yao.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.071
STEWART: What, what?
I know. It was stupid.

19:00.073 --> 19:02.073
Not locking a door
is what was stupid?

19:02.075 --> 19:04.175
All you had to do
was push it in and turn it.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.843
It's pretty simple.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.912
I know how to lock it.
My head was somewhere else.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.280
We know where your head was.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.781
Why is this even part
of the conversation?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.450
The lock seems to be
the least of it.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.019
Exactly. Dad, it seems
like you're okay with this.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.587
Well, the lock thing
bugs me a little.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.089
So, this was just a one-time
thing, though, right?

19:18.091 --> 19:19.857
No. Lots of times.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.826
Oh... I gotta,
I gotta sit down.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.628
I'm coming.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.329
(chair scrapes on floor)

19:27.367 --> 19:30.535
Okay, see, they clearly...

19:30.537 --> 19:32.770
This must be tough for you guys.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.005
Can you fill us in, please?

19:34.007 --> 19:35.506
We lived a rock and roll
lifestyle.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.308
Things were different back then.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.676
It was five years ago, Dad.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.278
Rock and roll never dies, Stew.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.513
I am deeply regretting
even pulling this thread.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.781
Yeah, aren't ya?

19:43.783 --> 19:45.216
Well, now that
it's out in the open,

19:45.218 --> 19:46.617
I think I should tell you
everything. Right, Yao?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.486
Sure. Let's get into it.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.720
Oh! No!
Oh, no, no!

19:49.722 --> 19:51.389
I can't take much more!

19:56.296 --> 19:58.029
DEAN: I think I learned
a valuable lesson tonight.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.231
Some things are better off
buried deep inside

20:00.233 --> 20:02.200
and shrouded in silence.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.168
I don't know.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.737
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm-I'm disturbed to the core,

20:06.739 --> 20:09.574
but... I think maybe it's
better it's out in the open.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.876
I think it's amazing
it's out in the open.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.144
What are you guys talking about?

20:13.146 --> 20:14.378
Don't worry about it.
Never ask that again.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.380
DEAN SR.: Yao said good night
and thank you

20:16.382 --> 20:17.815
for a lovely evening.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.550
Oh, that's real
sweet of him, Dad.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.586
I'm sorry I ruined
Thanksgiving, everyone.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.721
I don't know, I think you kind
of saved Thanksgiving, Dean.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.090
This was a trauma
I had to get past, and...

20:26.092 --> 20:28.326
I got my dignity back.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.927
And mine's on the ropes.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.229
DEAN SR.:
Well, we got Thanksgiving back.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.730
We're all together again,

20:32.732 --> 20:34.398
just like we used to do, Stew.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.033
To-do-Stew.
Is that something?

20:36.035 --> 20:38.169
Please let that be something.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.004
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's something, Dean.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.006
That's...
that's definitely something.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.874
(music plays on TV)

20:43.876 --> 20:45.409
Guys, look.

Mitch Grinder may be gone,

20:57.223 --> 20:59.724
but the grind goes on.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.026
Justice has a new first name.

21:02.028 --> 21:06.130
Timothy Olyphant

<i>The Grinder: New Orleans.</i>

21:14.407 --> 21:17.074
The Big Easy...

21:17.076 --> 21:19.777
just got hard.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.284
Excuse me.

21:29.589 --> 21:30.888
Well, I don't think
he needed that.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.790
No, he did not.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.793
Olyphant could be
good, though, huh?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.595
Stop it.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.497
Really, Dad?
Are you serious?
What?
