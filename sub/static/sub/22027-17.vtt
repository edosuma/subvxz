35:24.850 --> 35:26.320
We'll meet you at the hospital.

35:26.380 --> 35:28.590
Come on, come on.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.370
Right on time as usual.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.350
Both GSWs are gonna make it.

35:56.410 --> 35:58.410
- Really?
- That's what Dr. Choi said.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.480
- Both men are stable.
- Oh.

36:06.170 --> 36:07.340
How's your insurance, ma'am?

36:07.410 --> 36:09.510
- You all paid up?
- Excuse me?

36:09.580 --> 36:11.480
You know, I've been
thinking about your offer

36:11.550 --> 36:14.080
- to come over and work private.
- Mm-hmm.

36:14.150 --> 36:16.920
I'm gonna go ahead and pass.

36:16.990 --> 36:18.180
Me too.

36:27.260 --> 36:28.800
Hey, Mom.

36:28.860 --> 36:31.100
You want to grab breakfast
with Stella and me?

36:31.170 --> 36:32.600
I'm buying.

36:33.100 --> 36:34.370
Oh, hey, Champ.

36:36.790 --> 36:37.750
Hi.

36:37.770 --> 36:39.470
Hey, honey. Guess what?

36:39.540 --> 36:41.040
<i>♪ ♪</i>

36:41.110 --> 36:43.310
We're getting back together.

36:51.350 --> 36:52.520
Otis.

36:52.590 --> 36:54.359
Hey, I wanted to catch you

36:54.360 --> 36:55.519
before you headed out.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.160
Of course.

36:57.230 --> 36:59.330
I...

36:59.390 --> 37:01.990
I just wanted to say that, uh...

37:04.070 --> 37:05.870
If you need me to keep
coming to the bullpen

37:05.930 --> 37:08.230
just until I pass my
medical clearance

37:08.300 --> 37:12.210
then I guess I could
help you out.

37:12.270 --> 37:13.840
You sure?

37:13.910 --> 37:16.340
No, yeah... I mean...

37:16.410 --> 37:18.040
There are a few places
that I could help

37:18.110 --> 37:19.279
Connie streamline some things.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.480
And Molly's North doesn't
open until 4:30, so...

37:22.550 --> 37:26.020
Yeah, sure. Happy to do it.

37:26.090 --> 37:27.520
Sounds great.

37:27.590 --> 37:29.820
Like I said, that's
a real favor to me.

37:29.890 --> 37:31.590
Okay.

37:31.660 --> 37:34.530
Then, um, see you tomorrow.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.730
Sounds good. And, Otis...

37:38.730 --> 37:40.730
Thanks.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.540
No problem.

38:12.030 --> 38:13.870
All right.

38:13.940 --> 38:15.840
I messed up.

38:17.310 --> 38:20.940
I should have said something
the second he showed up at 51.

38:22.940 --> 38:24.610
I'm sorry.

38:25.710 --> 38:27.450
I'll tell you as many
times as you want.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.880
I'm sorry.

38:37.630 --> 38:38.989
I wish this was the first time

38:38.990 --> 38:41.430
you've held something
back from me.

38:42.060 --> 38:44.600
But it isn't.

38:47.740 --> 38:50.440
There was the whole
thing with Bria too.

38:55.580 --> 38:58.480
I love you. More than anything.

38:59.180 --> 39:00.580
Every time you leave me out,

39:00.650 --> 39:03.780
you put a little more
distance between us.

39:11.090 --> 39:13.960
It won't happen again.

39:18.870 --> 39:22.170
I don't want any
distance between us.

39:29.110 --> 39:31.280
Okay.

39:31.350 --> 39:33.380
Okay?

39:33.450 --> 39:34.850
Yeah.
