00:10.344 --> 00:15.214
    (dramatic wind howling)     

00:16.550 --> 00:19.685
   (ominous orchestral music)   

00:46.680 --> 00:50.649
        (police sirens)         

00:53.320 --> 00:57.322
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:02.196 --> 01:07.132
   (rap music plays from car)   

01:07.134 --> 01:10.836
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:26.720 --> 01:27.686
         (watch beeps)          

01:28.722 --> 01:32.291
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:52.113 --> 01:52.845
            (crack)             

02:13.634 --> 02:14.766
        (engine rumbles)        

02:19.807 --> 02:22.541
         (engine roars)         

02:27.381 --> 02:28.313
       - [Voiceover] Eh!        

02:28.682 --> 02:29.882
     That's a gun asshole.      

02:38.325 --> 02:40.159
      What the fuck are         
      you doing here, huh?      

02:41.729 --> 02:43.462
 This can't be no coincidence.  

02:44.265 --> 02:45.364
         Who sent you?          

02:45.833 --> 02:47.299
         Who sent you?          

02:48.869 --> 02:51.703
    Nobody in this town         
    crosses Lorenzo, no one.    

02:51.705 --> 02:52.938
       You're a dead man!       

02:54.275 --> 02:55.274
           (gunshot)            

02:55.643 --> 02:56.675
           (gunshot)            

02:57.845 --> 03:00.479
           (grunting)           

03:00.814 --> 03:03.949
    (tense orchestral music)    

03:08.722 --> 03:09.688
             - Hey!             

03:10.457 --> 03:11.390
              Hey!              

03:11.625 --> 03:12.558
              Hey!              

03:12.560 --> 03:13.692
           You, you!            

03:13.694 --> 03:15.227
         Motherfucker!          

03:15.229 --> 03:16.662
       (tires squealing)        

03:20.768 --> 03:22.568
    (tense orchestral music)    

03:47.394 --> 03:50.295
       (engine rumbling)        

03:56.971 --> 03:59.938
    (ominous ambient music)     

04:12.019 --> 04:14.753
      (cell phone ringing)      

04:16.757 --> 04:17.822
            - Hello?            

04:17.825 --> 04:18.757
         - [Thief] Roy?         

04:19.660 --> 04:20.826
      - Jimmy, what's up?       

04:20.827 --> 04:22.327
       - Things went bad        
       man, really bad.         

04:22.329 --> 04:23.562
         - Hey hold on.         

04:23.564 --> 04:24.830
      What happened, now        
      do you have the car?      

04:24.832 --> 04:25.831
      - Yea I got the car,      
      but what the fuck         

04:25.833 --> 04:26.832
      did you get me into?      

04:26.834 --> 04:28.700
    - Hey, now take it easy.    

04:28.902 --> 04:30.836
  Now, tell me what happened.   

04:30.838 --> 04:31.903
 - I did exactly what you said! 

04:31.905 --> 04:33.605
 I was there within the window. 

04:33.607 --> 04:35.524
 And then some guys show's up,  

04:35.525 --> 04:37.442
  puts a gun in my face, and    
  you guaranteed me that time!  

04:37.978 --> 04:39.711
      - But you got away?       

04:39.713 --> 04:41.747
 - Yea I got away but I had     
 to stab the dude in the neck!  

04:42.349 --> 04:44.783
   I boost cars, I don't stab   
   motherfuckers in the neck!   

04:44.785 --> 04:46.018
      - Okay, now listen.       

04:46.887 --> 04:48.387
        We can fix this.        

04:48.956 --> 04:51.957
    But, you got to bring       
    the car to the location.    

04:51.959 --> 04:52.891
      I'll meet you there.      

04:53.961 --> 04:55.394
        - Who's Lorenzo?        

04:55.396 --> 04:57.562
    (ominous ambient music)     

04:57.564 --> 04:58.697
  - How do you know that name?  

04:59.033 --> 04:59.898
          - Who is he?          

04:59.900 --> 05:01.500
    Roy, you fucked me man!     

05:01.502 --> 05:02.901
   - Now Jimmy, you knew this   
   was going to be risky.       

05:03.937 --> 05:05.354
         Now trust me.          

05:05.355 --> 05:06.772
     You don't want to fuck     
     with these people.         

05:07.074 --> 05:08.707
       If you bring us          
       the car right now,       

05:08.709 --> 05:09.841
        I can fix this.         

05:10.477 --> 05:11.576
          - Fuck you!           

05:11.845 --> 05:12.878
           Who's us?            

05:12.880 --> 05:14.946
      You fucked me man,        
      you knew those guys       

05:14.948 --> 05:15.847
    were going to be there.     

05:15.849 --> 05:16.982
         You set me up!         

05:18.018 --> 05:19.551
   - Think about this Jimmy.    

05:19.953 --> 05:21.687
      This is going to be       
      the most important        

05:21.689 --> 05:23.021
       move of your life.       

05:23.023 --> 05:26.024
  It's bad enough you have one  
  gangster out to kill you.     

05:33.901 --> 05:35.000
             Jimmy.             

05:35.436 --> 05:36.468
             Jimmy!             

05:36.704 --> 05:37.636
         (phone beeps)          

05:40.441 --> 05:44.609
    (dramatic ambient music)    

06:04.998 --> 06:08.667
    (ominous ambient music)     

06:24.051 --> 06:25.016
             (bang)             

06:27.821 --> 06:31.022
   (upbeat synthesizer music)   

09:00.007 --> 09:02.107
         (engine roars)         

09:04.144 --> 09:07.746
       (heavy breathing)        

09:09.249 --> 09:10.715
  - Detroit's a single mother   

09:10.717 --> 09:13.251
    living in a trailer park    
    with a baby on her hip.     

09:14.121 --> 09:16.087
      And L.A.'s a porn         
      star with fake tits,      

09:16.089 --> 09:18.290
       deep pockets, and        
       a coke problem.          

09:18.959 --> 09:21.126
    Everybody comes out         
    here to find something.     

09:21.995 --> 09:23.595
  Or run away from something.   

09:24.064 --> 09:25.597
        I'm doing both.         

09:27.134 --> 09:28.266
      Figured it was my         
      environment that was      

09:28.268 --> 09:30.235
      making me who I was.      

09:30.737 --> 09:32.237
When you fuck around like this, 

09:32.973 --> 09:34.739
      doesn't matter what       
      city you live in.         

09:35.342 --> 09:36.942
        Sooner of later,        

09:38.078 --> 09:39.778
things are bound to get bloody. 

09:41.348 --> 09:42.814
        Rule number one.        

09:43.216 --> 09:45.216
    Stay away from cars less    
    than five years old.        

09:45.218 --> 09:47.118
       I usually go for         
       Toyotas or Hondas.       

09:47.354 --> 09:49.087
The Japs know how to make cars. 

09:50.257 --> 09:52.157
       Rule number two,         
       stay away from any       

09:52.159 --> 09:53.992
  high-end luxury sports cars,  

09:53.994 --> 09:56.895
      Mercedes, BMW, Audi.      

09:57.264 --> 09:58.997
        Sure, the payout        
        might be higher,        

09:58.999 --> 10:00.231
    but then so is the risk.    

10:02.102 --> 10:03.835
       Rule number three.       

10:03.837 --> 10:06.605
     Mental focus, it's         
     all about the breath.      

10:06.873 --> 10:09.374
 (steady deliberate breathing)  

10:09.776 --> 10:11.610
    Keeping your head           
    clear, and being present    

10:11.612 --> 10:12.978
is of paramount importance when 

10:12.980 --> 10:14.245
     a boost is going down.     

10:14.982 --> 10:17.148
    I started this when I       
    was young and desperate     

10:17.150 --> 10:19.284
      and bored, but I          
      had a talent for it.      

10:19.286 --> 10:21.353
    On my best days, I would    
    say it's a calling.         

10:21.888 --> 10:24.089
   Not like the other           
   fuckos who joyride around    

10:24.091 --> 10:25.223
         and abuse it.          

10:25.225 --> 10:28.293
     And yes, if you aren't     
     a moron, being a thief     

10:28.295 --> 10:29.861
      ain't so dangerous.       

10:29.863 --> 10:32.230
    But this is my practice,    
    this is my discipline.      

10:33.266 --> 10:36.735
     Rule number four,          
     perception is reality.     

10:36.937 --> 10:38.103
   You'd be amazing with        
   what you can get away with   

10:38.105 --> 10:39.371
if you look like you're working.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.740
       But I am working.        

10:42.976 --> 10:45.243
    Rule number five, you       
    pick the day in advance,    

10:45.245 --> 10:46.378
        but not the car.        

10:47.247 --> 10:49.047
    Picking the car is          
    like deciding if you're     

10:49.049 --> 10:50.915
      going to go talk to       
      a girl at the bar.        

10:51.251 --> 10:53.385
It's a frequency you tune into. 

10:54.321 --> 10:55.987
You can call it a gut instinct, 

10:55.989 --> 10:58.223
 for me, it's been like a       
 wave at the back of my spine.  

10:58.225 --> 10:59.691
      And I don't know if       
      it's the excitement       

10:59.693 --> 11:01.660
       of the unknown,          
       or the adrenaline,       

11:01.962 --> 11:03.328
     but it's never wrong.      

11:04.698 --> 11:07.032
    I guess deep down, it's     
    the part I like best.       

11:08.101 --> 11:11.202
     I've stolen 336 cars       
     in the last 10 years,      

11:11.204 --> 11:13.938
and this whooptie maked it 337. 

11:14.875 --> 11:18.443
   Rule six, you never          
   trust anyone in the game.    

11:18.445 --> 11:19.377
             Ever.              

11:21.081 --> 11:22.414
      And one last thing,       

11:24.117 --> 11:25.784
    always know your price.     

11:26.319 --> 11:27.919
    My name is Jimmy Greco.     

11:28.388 --> 11:30.889
     And this is the story      
     of the day I died.         

11:30.891 --> 11:33.058
        (dramatic bass)         

11:35.462 --> 11:38.897
      (gentle piano music)      

11:40.734 --> 11:42.267
       (knocking on door)       

11:51.878 --> 11:52.877
         Good morning.          

11:53.380 --> 11:54.746
        - Good morning.         

11:54.748 --> 11:56.014
          - Surprise.           

12:06.893 --> 12:08.093
      - [Girl] Do all guys      
      from the East Coast       

12:08.095 --> 12:09.394
     put it down like you?      

12:11.331 --> 12:12.831
- [Jimmy] I'm from Detroit baby.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.399
           (laughter)           

12:14.935 --> 12:16.968
       - That's basically       
       the East Coast.          

12:18.238 --> 12:19.771
     - [Jimmy] Not really.      

12:19.773 --> 12:23.842
 - Well it's closer to New      
 York than it is to California. 

12:24.444 --> 12:25.443
            - True.             

12:25.445 --> 12:27.011
           (laughter)           

12:27.414 --> 12:29.047
      But the answer's no.      

12:31.284 --> 12:32.817
           - No what?           

12:32.819 --> 12:36.020
   - [Jimmy] No, not all guys   
   from the East are like me.   

12:38.859 --> 12:40.391
    Want to know the reason     
    it feels so good?           

12:42.295 --> 12:43.528
             - Why?             

12:43.530 --> 12:44.929
      - 'Cause I love you.      

12:48.769 --> 12:50.068
        - Careful Jimmy.        

12:53.273 --> 12:55.440
     - You're the one that      
     needs to be careful.       

12:56.076 --> 12:58.042
I'm fine expressing my emotions.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.311
     I know what it means.      

13:00.313 --> 13:01.479
       - Is that a fact?        

13:02.449 --> 13:04.516
    - I could die tomorrow,     
    and then what?              

13:06.887 --> 13:08.419
      Think any of this         
      is going to matter?       

13:09.956 --> 13:11.322
        We're dust baby.        

13:13.393 --> 13:15.059
  - We're not just dust Jimmy.  

13:15.996 --> 13:17.328
      We're human beings.       

13:19.199 --> 13:20.298
      - But it's our human      
      minds that assign         

13:20.300 --> 13:22.133
     meaning to our lives.      

13:23.336 --> 13:25.036
  I fucking love you, so what?  

13:26.273 --> 13:27.438
       What are you going       
       to do about it?          

13:27.440 --> 13:28.907
        - How romantic.         

13:30.877 --> 13:33.144
  I'll think about that while   
  I make your breakfast.        

13:35.182 --> 13:36.915
- Brew the coffee strong please.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.350
    (ominous ambient music)     

13:39.352 --> 13:41.019
   - I know how you like it.    

13:42.823 --> 13:44.522
        (distorted bass)        

13:45.458 --> 13:47.425
       - [Voiceover] Shit       
       is fucking good!         

13:50.463 --> 13:52.363
- [Voiceover] Yea, it's not bad.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.334
     - [Voiceover] Not bad?     

13:56.335 --> 13:57.401
 It's way better then anything  
 else out there right now.      

13:57.404 --> 13:58.970
       - [Voiceover] So?        

13:58.972 --> 14:00.505
    Doesn't make it amazing     
    just 'cause it's better     

14:00.507 --> 14:02.106
       than all the other       
       shit out there.          

14:02.108 --> 14:05.143
    - Babe, this negativity     
    is really off putting.      

14:05.145 --> 14:06.978
     I mean yea, we finally     
     get some good shit,        

14:06.980 --> 14:08.479
     and you're over there.     

14:10.517 --> 14:12.884
 I totally forgot this fucking  
 monkey was sitting here.       

14:15.388 --> 14:16.487
         What's up man?         

14:16.957 --> 14:18.523
    Hmm, you got the money?     

14:20.427 --> 14:22.894
     Maybe I'll just bleed      
     you out instead.           

14:24.598 --> 14:26.364
      - It's okay Gevorg.       

14:27.000 --> 14:29.334
       Baby, nobody's           
       getting cut today.       

14:30.270 --> 14:32.871
   Too messy, I'm in no mood.   

14:39.379 --> 14:40.645
            - Fine.             

14:44.484 --> 14:46.951
      Why the fuck are you      
      still sitting here?       

14:52.025 --> 14:54.592
    (ominous ambient music)     

14:59.332 --> 15:00.431
         - [Roy] Hola!          

15:00.567 --> 15:01.933
    - Yo, what the fuck man?    

15:02.235 --> 15:03.534
         - Como estas?          

15:05.505 --> 15:06.571
     - [Boy] Yo, I told you     
     not to come out here       

15:06.573 --> 15:08.273
   without calling me first.    

15:08.275 --> 15:09.540
           (laughter)           

15:09.542 --> 15:11.042
     - Hey you think I          
     give a shit about your     

15:11.044 --> 15:13.244
       chavalos and your        
       powder pushing?          

15:13.246 --> 15:15.580
  - Do all you fucking beaners  
  got maize in your ears?       

15:16.416 --> 15:18.917
    Or is it just you, huh?     

15:19.519 --> 15:21.152
       - Let me tell you        
       something, loco.         

15:22.489 --> 15:24.022
      You keep pushing me,      

15:24.391 --> 15:26.124
      you're not going to       
      like what happens.        

15:29.529 --> 15:31.362
    - Fuck you going to do?     

15:32.599 --> 15:37.001
  - How about, I call some of   
  my cartel boys down here,     

15:38.138 --> 15:39.637
   to rape your little slut,    

15:41.274 --> 15:44.442
     gouge your eyes out,       
     watch you peck around      

15:44.444 --> 15:46.678
 like a fucking blind chicken.  

15:47.347 --> 15:51.582
        (pecking noises)        

15:54.955 --> 15:57.422
Hey, come on, lighten up, loco! 

15:57.424 --> 16:00.224
     Shit, I called you, I      
     left a message, read?      

16:00.226 --> 16:01.626
   You never got back to me.    

16:01.628 --> 16:03.461
 So I came down here in person, 

16:03.463 --> 16:07.031
    to discuss some             
    time-sensitive business.    

16:09.569 --> 16:11.502
- Fucking blow got me all jumpy.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.204
           (laughter)           

16:13.974 --> 16:14.639
   What the fuck do you want?   

16:14.641 --> 16:15.740
         Make it quick.         

16:15.742 --> 16:19.043
    - How would you like to     
    expand your business?       

16:19.279 --> 16:21.579
- Well you know I would love to,

16:21.581 --> 16:23.348
   but Lorenzo runs the show.   

16:23.483 --> 16:25.183
    I'm already at              
    capacity, in accordance     

16:25.185 --> 16:26.751
      with our agreement.       

16:26.753 --> 16:28.619
            (snorts)            

16:28.621 --> 16:30.555
   - [Roy] What if Lorenzo's    
   not around anymore?          

16:31.391 --> 16:33.157
      - What if, what if?       

16:34.094 --> 16:35.360
            What if?            

16:37.764 --> 16:39.998
     - Some shit's getting      
     ready to go down.          

16:45.038 --> 16:46.304
        - I'm listening.        

16:46.439 --> 16:48.139
       - The question is,       
       how much would you       

16:48.141 --> 16:51.142
       be willing to pay        
       to get in on it?         

16:53.646 --> 16:54.746
             - Huh.             

16:59.652 --> 17:02.487
     Since you seem to be       
     the man with the plan,     

17:02.622 --> 17:04.055
       why don't you save       
       us both the time         

17:04.057 --> 17:05.656
    and let me know how much    
    it's going to cost me?      

17:06.459 --> 17:07.724
        - I'm not sure.         

17:08.560 --> 17:10.528
      I'm going to have to      
      talk to my best guy.      

17:10.530 --> 17:12.063
      And then double it.       

17:15.035 --> 17:16.768
- Yea, why do we need the best? 

17:17.670 --> 17:21.105
      - Word is, Lorenzo's      
      dying, amigo.             

17:21.107 --> 17:22.406
       He needs a kidney.       

17:23.076 --> 17:24.541
  - Yea, how do you know this?  

17:25.377 --> 17:28.445
    - Because birdies           
    talk, and birdies sing.     

17:28.448 --> 17:29.647
           (laughter)           

17:30.183 --> 17:32.550
       And then Big Tommy       
       pays me a visit.         

17:32.552 --> 17:34.318
    (ominous ambient music)     

17:34.320 --> 17:35.653
        Yea, well well.         

17:36.589 --> 17:38.089
     - Don't start with         
     me bro, I'd prefer to      

17:38.091 --> 17:40.491
     make this as painless      
     as possible, alright?      

17:40.627 --> 17:42.360
 - Good to see you old friend.  

17:44.164 --> 17:46.097
      - We're not friends       
      anymore, are we Roy?      

17:47.333 --> 17:49.534
       - Well, since your       
       little accident.         

17:51.471 --> 17:53.071
  - I'm here to talk business.  

17:53.440 --> 17:54.839
         - Okay, well,          

17:55.241 --> 17:57.375
    how about a little drink    
    for old time's sake?        

18:00.313 --> 18:01.579
             - No.              

18:02.282 --> 18:04.082
       I need you to move       
       something for me.        

18:06.553 --> 18:08.486
     - You know what they       
     say about forgiveness?     

18:11.324 --> 18:13.458
      To forgive is to          
      set a prisoner free.      

18:15.228 --> 18:17.428
      Then you find you         
      that prisoner's you.      

18:21.367 --> 18:22.667
     - It's time sensitive.     

18:23.603 --> 18:24.769
    And extremely valuable,     
    and that's why              

18:24.771 --> 18:26.637
         I came to you.         

18:27.140 --> 18:31.709
    - He wants me to courier    
    a package from Mexico.      

18:32.679 --> 18:35.780
    Tells me that there's a     
    kidney inside that box.     

18:36.249 --> 18:38.249
  - Yea, makes sense I guess.   

18:38.618 --> 18:40.551
Nobody's seen Lorenzo in months.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.488
       - Big Tommy was          
       very, very serious       

18:43.690 --> 18:45.423
     about the time frame.      

18:46.292 --> 18:47.758
 - Won't they know it was you?  

18:49.629 --> 18:51.195
       - They'll suspect.       

18:51.197 --> 18:52.396
    With all the                
    connections I got, I got    

18:52.398 --> 18:53.798
      diplomatic immunity.      

18:54.167 --> 18:55.733
     - And what if they         
     come after you anyway?     

18:57.437 --> 18:59.137
 - You let me worry about that. 

18:59.739 --> 19:03.307
    Lorenzo's got way too       
    many enemies down south.    

19:04.577 --> 19:06.677
 - And little birdie's do talk. 

19:11.417 --> 19:12.550
     - [Jimmy] When you're      
     alone, it's hard           

19:12.552 --> 19:14.152
       to be present with       
       your thoughts.           

19:14.721 --> 19:17.421
      And that's our            
      innate fear of death      

19:17.423 --> 19:19.790
    manifesting around the      
    things we can't control.    

19:20.426 --> 19:21.726
           - No, man.           

19:23.229 --> 19:24.829
 It's 'cause I've got regrets.  

19:26.166 --> 19:27.832
- But you can't change the past.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.535
   - Yea, but at least if       
   I'm going to get clipped,    

19:30.537 --> 19:32.370
      I know it's going to      
      fucking happen fast.      

19:32.539 --> 19:34.772
  What I'm most terrified of,   

19:35.341 --> 19:37.708
      is the thought of a       
      slow painful death,       

19:37.710 --> 19:39.944
      not actually dying.       

19:39.945 --> 19:42.179
  Especially after what I saw   
  my dad go through, you know?  

19:42.815 --> 19:43.681
      - God rest his soul.      

19:43.683 --> 19:44.715
             - Yep.             

19:45.351 --> 19:46.517
      Cheers to that, man.      

19:47.554 --> 19:51.689
    (dramatic ambient music)    

19:55.962 --> 19:57.728
       What's up with           
       the lotus ink bro?       

19:59.465 --> 20:00.898
  - Take the boy out the hood.  

20:02.368 --> 20:03.868
    - Is that a gang tattoo?    

20:04.437 --> 20:06.504
  - No man, we just got pride   
  from where we're from.        

20:07.407 --> 20:09.540
     Those guys had my          
     back and I had theirs.     

20:10.643 --> 20:12.977
    We weren't a gang in the    
    traditional sense, but      

20:12.979 --> 20:14.512
    we protected each other.    

20:14.881 --> 20:16.614
   - So why'd you leave, man?   

20:18.551 --> 20:19.650
          - Honestly?           

20:26.426 --> 20:27.458
           Too cold.            

20:27.460 --> 20:28.793
           (laughter)           

20:29.796 --> 20:30.828
           - Uh huh.            

20:33.866 --> 20:35.333
So is that really why you left? 

20:36.302 --> 20:37.802
          The weather?          

20:38.538 --> 20:40.871
   - Me and my boys got in a    
   fight outside The Derby.     

20:41.841 --> 20:43.241
     One of them got shot.      

20:43.409 --> 20:44.909
   Did you know Rick McKeeum?   

20:45.878 --> 20:47.311
          - Nah, man.           

20:48.948 --> 20:51.249
   - After that, things         
   just kind of slowed down.    

20:51.818 --> 20:52.683
       Felt like I was          
       waiting around for       

20:52.685 --> 20:53.951
    something bad to happen.    

20:55.288 --> 20:56.921
  Figured if I came out here,   

20:56.923 --> 20:58.823
give me a chance to start fresh.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.425
- How's it working out for you? 

21:02.729 --> 21:03.995
        - It's working.         

21:06.633 --> 21:09.734
       'Cause I'm sitting       
       here, with Clyde,        

21:09.869 --> 21:11.869
       drinking beers           
       and getting a tan.       

21:12.372 --> 21:15.439
    (dramatic ambient music)    

21:15.808 --> 21:17.575
What about you, why'd you leave?

21:19.012 --> 21:20.945
       - Do you remember        
       Mike, my cousin?         

21:21.414 --> 21:23.848
  - [Jimmy] I never knew him,   
  I remember he got killed.     

21:24.851 --> 21:27.351
      - Yea, well after...      

21:28.488 --> 21:31.656
   My father died, and Mike,    

21:32.592 --> 21:36.360
   I kind of realized I was     
   going down the wrong path.   

21:37.797 --> 21:39.397
   - [Jimmy] I'm sorry, I       
   know you guys were close.    

21:39.399 --> 21:42.633
   - I wasn't ever really       
   that close to my dad, man.   

21:43.369 --> 21:44.068
         Not like you.          

21:44.070 --> 21:46.070
    (dramatic ambient music)    

21:53.846 --> 21:55.479
 - I was talking about Michael. 

21:57.984 --> 21:59.850
        - Right, right.         

21:59.852 --> 22:01.952
    (dramatic ambient music)    

22:06.693 --> 22:10.528
       (engine rumbling)        

22:15.768 --> 22:16.901
            - Jimmy!            

22:16.903 --> 22:18.336
          - Mr. Slick!          

22:20.573 --> 22:21.939
    - Come on to the office.    

22:22.475 --> 22:23.908
 - Nah man, I got to get going. 

22:23.910 --> 22:25.376
       I just got to go.        

22:25.645 --> 22:26.744
     - I got some tequila,      
     and I want to              

22:26.746 --> 22:28.379
  talk to you anyway, come on.  

22:31.017 --> 22:35.953
  (Tejano music over intercom)  

22:41.794 --> 22:43.527
       - There's an extra       
       1,000 bucks here.        

22:43.763 --> 22:45.963
    - I thought you             
    deserved a little bonus.    

22:47.967 --> 22:49.367
      - [Jimmy] No thanks.      

22:50.002 --> 22:51.435
    - Jimmy, don't be rude.     

22:51.637 --> 22:52.870
- I don't mean to be rude, but I

22:52.872 --> 22:54.672
    like our arrangement        
    just fine the way it is.    

22:54.674 --> 22:56.140
     And I know what it         
     means if I take that.      

22:57.777 --> 22:58.943
 - What are you talking about?  

22:58.945 --> 22:59.977
   - It means I work for you.   

23:00.713 --> 23:01.979
   - And what do you do now?    

23:01.981 --> 23:04.815
   - Now I work with you,       
   there's a big difference.    

23:05.385 --> 23:06.150
         - How's that?          

23:07.120 --> 23:08.552
           - Simple.            

23:08.688 --> 23:11.088
       I bring you cars         
       for $2,500 a pop.        

23:11.591 --> 23:13.023
 And you know as well as I do,  

23:13.025 --> 23:14.792
   I can go anywhere in town    
   and get that same price.     

23:14.961 --> 23:17.428
  What makes us special, is     
  that we're both consistent.   

23:17.830 --> 23:19.029
           (laughter)           

23:19.031 --> 23:20.030
       - Is that a fact?        

23:20.400 --> 23:21.165
    - [Jimmy] Damn straight.    

23:22.168 --> 23:23.534
          - You know?           

23:26.606 --> 23:28.706
      This tequila's            
      made from a cactus.       

23:30.777 --> 23:33.411
Meant to be sipped, and enjoyed.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.980
      To power and money.       

23:38.951 --> 23:40.117
           (laughter)           

23:41.788 --> 23:43.621
 You know, but sometimes Jimmy, 

23:43.623 --> 23:45.156
you got to just say, "fuck it." 

23:45.158 --> 23:47.792
    (ominous ambient music)     

23:49.095 --> 23:50.795
    - What's this about Roy?    

23:52.932 --> 23:54.965
 - I got a special job for you. 

23:56.469 --> 23:58.135
   - I don't do special jobs.   

23:58.905 --> 24:00.504
   - Not even for big money?    

24:01.073 --> 24:02.706
     - How much we talking?     

24:02.942 --> 24:04.442
          - 20 grand.           

24:04.577 --> 24:07.445
     - I just told you I        
     don't do special jobs.     

24:07.447 --> 24:08.679
           - 50 then.           

24:08.681 --> 24:10.114
    - You're just going to      
    throw numbers at me now?    

24:10.116 --> 24:11.515
      - Yea, I'm serious.       

24:11.517 --> 24:13.451
       - Well then again,       
       respectfully Roy,        

24:13.453 --> 24:15.052
 I'm going to have to decline.  

24:15.721 --> 24:17.521
        - Well how about        
        a respectable...        

24:17.857 --> 24:19.089
           100 grand?           

24:21.627 --> 24:23.093
- [Jimmy] Thanks for the drink. 

24:23.095 --> 24:26.130
    (ominous ambient music)     

24:27.700 --> 24:28.999
          - 200 grand.          

24:29.001 --> 24:31.769
    (ominous ambient music)     

24:33.773 --> 24:36.607
Ah, now I've got your attention.

24:36.609 --> 24:37.875
       - Are you serious?       

24:38.711 --> 24:40.177
  - I don't fuck around Jimmy.  

24:40.179 --> 24:43.080
    (ominous ambient music)     

24:47.119 --> 24:48.986
 - What kind of job we talking? 

24:49.489 --> 24:50.921
     - Just another boost.      

24:51.624 --> 24:53.491
      You got five minutes      
      to steal a car,           

24:53.493 --> 24:56.060
     containing some            
     really valuable cargo.     

24:56.963 --> 24:58.896
       It's going down          
       in broad daylight.       

24:59.031 --> 25:01.131
       All you got to do,       
       bring me the car.        

25:01.133 --> 25:04.201
    Don't ask any questions,    
    and that's it.              

25:04.971 --> 25:06.036
          - That's it?          

25:07.173 --> 25:08.906
       - Yep, that's it.        

25:08.908 --> 25:11.242
    (ominous ambient music)     

25:11.244 --> 25:12.810
          - Two fifty.          

25:14.947 --> 25:15.946
    - I got to make a call.     

25:15.948 --> 25:17.248
          - What for?           

25:18.584 --> 25:20.818
    - Now I know your price.    

25:21.287 --> 25:23.220
         (static hiss)          

25:23.222 --> 25:26.090
    (ominous ambient music)     

25:35.268 --> 25:37.668
       - Tommy, you mind?       

25:40.740 --> 25:45.309
    (ominous ambient music)     

25:52.184 --> 25:53.751
       You know who I am?       

25:55.655 --> 25:57.121
     - You must be Lorenzo.     

25:59.125 --> 26:00.991
 But you don't look sick to me. 

26:00.993 --> 26:02.226
   - That's because I'm not.    

26:03.162 --> 26:04.695
   At least not in the body.    

26:05.231 --> 26:06.697
       Maybe in the mind.       

26:06.699 --> 26:10.067
  - I thought this was all      
  about you needing a kidney.   

26:11.938 --> 26:13.203
    - What's your name kid?     

26:13.973 --> 26:15.005
            - Jimmy.            

26:15.207 --> 26:16.907
    - What do you do Jimmy?     

26:17.176 --> 26:18.309
       What's your thing?       

26:19.211 --> 26:20.778
        - I boost cars.         

26:21.280 --> 26:23.781
     - And how did you wind     
     up working for Austin?     

26:25.217 --> 26:26.784
   - I don't work for nobody.   

26:26.786 --> 26:28.185
    - And yet, here we are.     

26:28.187 --> 26:30.788
    (ominous ambient music)     

26:33.159 --> 26:34.658
     It's amazing isn't it?     

26:34.660 --> 26:36.927
      How crystal clear         
      a situation becomes       

26:36.929 --> 26:39.063
     when you're looking at     
     it from the outside?       

26:40.266 --> 26:41.999
       - It's a matter          
       of point of view.        

26:42.168 --> 26:43.167
           - Exactly.           

26:44.804 --> 26:46.136
         We're animals.         

26:46.138 --> 26:48.038
 That's part of our conundrum.  

26:48.808 --> 26:50.941
      Greed serves us           
      very well in nature,      

26:50.943 --> 26:53.944
    but in the human world,     
    we have our intellect       

26:53.946 --> 26:55.245
     to tell us otherwise.      

26:56.983 --> 26:59.116
  - If you were me, you would   
  have done the same thing.     

27:00.152 --> 27:01.352
         - Hard to say.         

27:04.223 --> 27:07.257
  (ominous heart beat effect)   

27:17.336 --> 27:21.271
    (ominous ambient music)     

27:31.651 --> 27:33.784
       You know I have to       
       kill you, right?         

27:34.086 --> 27:36.186
    (ominous ambient music)     

27:36.188 --> 27:37.921
- You don't have to do anything.

27:38.224 --> 27:41.191
  - I didn't get to be in this  
  position by being merciful.   

27:42.161 --> 27:43.360
            - Mercy?            

27:44.296 --> 27:45.829
       Is that what we're       
       talking about?           

27:46.298 --> 27:47.698
 - If you were in my position,  

27:47.700 --> 27:49.299
    you'd do the same thing.    

27:51.237 --> 27:52.269
         - Hard to say.         

27:54.273 --> 27:55.706
     - How old are you kid?     

27:56.342 --> 27:57.274
             - 26.              

27:57.743 --> 27:58.976
            - Jesus.            

27:59.345 --> 28:02.112
       When I was 26, I         
       lived in Chelsea.        

28:03.816 --> 28:05.182
     - Why'd you come here?     

28:05.885 --> 28:07.384
      - Because I knew          
      that I would have to      

28:07.386 --> 28:09.286
       burn some people         
       if I wanted to get       

28:09.288 --> 28:10.988
     where I wanted to go.      

28:11.223 --> 28:13.190
    Or, move somewhere else,    

28:13.192 --> 28:14.425
    and take what was mine.     

28:14.427 --> 28:15.726
      I chose the latter.       

28:18.230 --> 28:20.931
  - Makes sense, but why L.A.?  

28:21.300 --> 28:22.766
    It's the weather, right?    

28:23.035 --> 28:25.269
     I'm from Detroit, you      
     ever been to Midwest?      

28:25.271 --> 28:26.804
       It's fucking cold.       

28:28.307 --> 28:30.274
  - First I went to New York.   

28:30.409 --> 28:32.276
 But the Guineas run that town. 

28:32.278 --> 28:34.044
          Also, cold.           

28:34.480 --> 28:37.047
      After a few years,        
      I came out to L.A.,       

28:37.049 --> 28:39.750
       and I knew right         
       away, I'd hit it.        

28:41.921 --> 28:43.220
       - How'd you know?        

28:43.956 --> 28:46.457
      - Back then, my           
      main thing was blow,      

28:46.459 --> 28:49.460
     and this bitch ran all     
     the coke from Mexico.      

28:49.929 --> 28:52.029
 Ruthless cunt named Graciela.  

28:52.798 --> 28:54.965
  Bat shit crazy, that broad.   

28:55.101 --> 28:57.935
       And good looking         
       too, huge titties.       

28:58.370 --> 29:00.504
    But if she even thought     
    you'd crossed her,          

29:00.506 --> 29:03.874
   she'd have you burned        
   alive, cut out your eyes,    

29:03.876 --> 29:05.409
    and chop off your dick.     

29:06.278 --> 29:08.011
      That's the funny          
      thing about people,       

29:08.013 --> 29:10.314
    you can deify them, but     
    that the end of the day,    

29:10.316 --> 29:12.483
      their flesh is just       
      as soft and fragile       

29:12.485 --> 29:14.251
       as a baby girl's.        

29:15.221 --> 29:17.888
 - Something tells me things    
 didn't end well for Graciela.  

29:20.526 --> 29:23.260
- She fell victim to her vanity.

29:24.263 --> 29:25.996
       And then I put a         
       gun under her chin       

29:25.998 --> 29:27.531
 and blew her fucking head off. 

29:29.869 --> 29:32.069
      Men get a bad wrap,       
      but it never ceases       

29:32.071 --> 29:34.471
     to surprise me, how        
     stupid a woman becomes     

29:34.473 --> 29:36.507
   when she sees a big dick.    

29:39.812 --> 29:42.780
      Just like that, pow,      
      no more Graciela,         

29:42.782 --> 29:44.515
      and I'm running the       
      coke from Mexico.         

29:46.352 --> 29:47.351
      You think the             
      wetbacks give a fuck      

29:47.353 --> 29:48.986
    who's running the shit?     

29:48.988 --> 29:51.855
   They don't, trust me, as     
   long as you're consistent.   

29:51.857 --> 29:54.491
   (tense synthesizer music)    

29:59.031 --> 30:00.364
     You ever been in love?     

30:02.134 --> 30:03.100
            - What?             

30:03.536 --> 30:05.836
    - You ever been in love?    

30:07.406 --> 30:08.438
         - Sure I have.         

30:09.542 --> 30:11.108
      - Tell me about it.       

30:11.377 --> 30:13.510
   (tense synthesizer music)    

30:15.981 --> 30:18.081
 - First time was Sarah Madson. 

30:19.819 --> 30:21.518
      She was a couple of       
      years older than me.      

30:22.822 --> 30:24.254
    She lived up the street.    

30:26.425 --> 30:28.158
  When I was 16, we hooked up.  

30:29.261 --> 30:30.494
   Spent the summer together.   

30:32.231 --> 30:33.463
Used to pick her up in my truck,

30:33.465 --> 30:34.965
    and we'd sleep under        
    that stars at this lake     

30:34.967 --> 30:36.333
       near my home town.       

30:37.403 --> 30:39.169
      - Was she beautiful?      

30:41.273 --> 30:42.439
             - Yea.             

30:44.510 --> 30:45.943
        - So that's it?         

30:46.245 --> 30:47.511
          Just Sarah?           

30:51.417 --> 30:53.116
     - And my girl Sherry.      

30:53.853 --> 30:55.085
           - Sherry?            

30:55.588 --> 30:57.454
    - Yea, my girl Shereen.     

30:58.991 --> 31:00.557
      - Tell me about her.      

31:02.862 --> 31:04.127
       - She's different.       

31:05.264 --> 31:06.463
         She's special.         

31:06.465 --> 31:09.499
   (tense synthesizer music)    

31:11.136 --> 31:12.569
     I can't figure it out.     

31:13.239 --> 31:14.638
  She never asks me for much.   

31:16.075 --> 31:19.476
 She maintains this, distance.  

31:22.114 --> 31:23.113
       I tell her I love        
       her all the time         

31:23.115 --> 31:25.015
   'cause honestly I do, but.   

31:25.017 --> 31:27.417
    (dramatic ambient music)    

31:32.625 --> 31:34.324
          - But what?           

31:35.427 --> 31:37.160
   - I don't know, nothing      
   man, it's hard to explain.   

31:37.162 --> 31:38.495
    What do you care anyway?    

31:40.933 --> 31:44.401
      - All my life, I've       
      spent avoiding love.      

31:45.537 --> 31:48.572
   I've had a few meaningful    
   relationships, but           

31:49.241 --> 31:51.008
    when it comes to women,     

31:51.410 --> 31:54.111
      friends, family, in       
      our line of work,         

31:54.113 --> 31:55.913
   it's best to keep it lean.   

31:56.482 --> 31:58.649
      Loved ones become...      

32:00.552 --> 32:02.452
       Like blind spots.        

32:06.525 --> 32:08.659
   I have a daughter, Jimmy.    

32:09.528 --> 32:10.594
            Sierra.             

32:11.030 --> 32:12.262
          She's seven.          

32:12.598 --> 32:14.598
    Never loved her             
    mother, but, the moment     

32:14.600 --> 32:16.199
 I laid eyes on my little girl, 

32:16.201 --> 32:17.935
       my world flipped.        

32:20.172 --> 32:22.005
      Except for Tommy,         
      I kept her a secret       

32:22.007 --> 32:24.574
  from my entire organization.  

32:25.544 --> 32:27.411
The only reason I'm telling you,

32:27.413 --> 32:29.713
     is that she's the one      
     who's dying, not me.       

32:30.049 --> 32:32.049
      And I need your help      
      to save her life.         

32:36.221 --> 32:37.988
      - This whole thing's      
      about a little girl?      

32:38.390 --> 32:41.191
       A little girl, and       
       a blood disease.         

32:42.962 --> 32:44.661
      It's ironic really.       

32:46.131 --> 32:49.232
  All the energy I expended     
  trying to keep her a secret,  

32:49.234 --> 32:53.704
    and now, apparently,        
    it's the very same thing    

32:54.073 --> 32:55.539
      that's brought us         
      to this unfortunate       

32:55.541 --> 32:57.607
     and somewhat               
     impossible situation.      

32:57.609 --> 32:59.710
    (ominous ambient music)     

32:59.712 --> 33:01.311
  - Why should I believe you?   

33:02.114 --> 33:03.647
     - You said it              
     yourself, look at me.      

33:03.649 --> 33:05.215
   I'm as healthy as a horse.   

33:06.452 --> 33:08.185
     Now I'm going to           
     level with you Jimmy.      

33:09.321 --> 33:11.621
     Because we're running      
     fucking short on time,     

33:11.623 --> 33:13.457
       and we could chat        
       here all night.          

33:14.326 --> 33:17.160
 Even if the kidney is intact,  

33:17.629 --> 33:20.998
    she still has only a        
    70% chance of it taking.    

33:22.534 --> 33:24.234
      I'm not going to          
      sit here and make up      

33:24.236 --> 33:26.069
  some elaborate lie about how  

33:26.071 --> 33:28.305
       if you help me, I        
       will let you go.         

33:28.307 --> 33:30.374
     You fucked me, Jimmy.      

33:30.642 --> 33:32.509
 And I know you didn't mean it, 

33:32.511 --> 33:34.211
     but you did it anyway.     

33:34.213 --> 33:35.612
       And now you have         
       to pay the price.        

33:36.482 --> 33:37.681
  So, this is going to go down  

33:37.683 --> 33:39.750
    one of either two ways.     

33:40.386 --> 33:42.352
       One, you're going        
       to tell me where         

33:42.354 --> 33:45.022
       the kidney is, and       
       when I have it,          

33:45.024 --> 33:46.623
      Tommy here, is going      
      to put a bullet           

33:46.625 --> 33:48.191
      through your heart.       

33:48.193 --> 33:50.293
       Or, you don't tell       
       me where it is,          

33:50.295 --> 33:52.696
      and I have one of my      
      less civilized guys       

33:52.698 --> 33:54.097
       go to work on you.       

33:54.099 --> 33:56.700
   (tense synthesizer music)    

33:59.338 --> 34:00.704
       - What if I set          
       everything right?        

34:03.709 --> 34:06.043
 - Jimmy, I have my reputation. 

34:06.545 --> 34:07.677
        - So that's it?         

34:10.649 --> 34:11.681
          - That's it.          

34:11.683 --> 34:14.384
   (tense synthesizer music)    

34:20.692 --> 34:23.693
    (ominous ambient music)     

34:27.766 --> 34:30.833
   - Although I myself am not   
   a violent man, Lorenzo,      

34:31.570 --> 34:33.670
 I understand people like you.  

34:34.572 --> 34:36.706
 So before I agree to anything, 

34:37.309 --> 34:38.708
       here are my terms.       

34:39.411 --> 34:40.811
       I need two things.       

34:41.647 --> 34:42.679
              One,              

34:43.215 --> 34:44.714
          I want 150K.          

34:45.684 --> 34:47.117
      For my girl Shereen.      

34:47.252 --> 34:48.518
Put her brother through college,

34:48.520 --> 34:49.753
 take care of her for a while.  

34:51.422 --> 34:52.688
            And two,            

34:53.092 --> 34:55.092
      you got to let me go      
      for a couple hours.       

34:56.094 --> 34:58.829
   I'll bring you back the      
   kidney, that's a promise.    

35:00.165 --> 35:01.798
     But I need some time.      

35:02.734 --> 35:05.302
       - You know I can't       
       do that Jimmy.           

35:05.304 --> 35:06.670
      - Just hear me out.       

35:07.506 --> 35:09.673
   Like I said, I understand    
   people like you.             

35:10.209 --> 35:11.641
   I know that you'll find      
   the thing that I love most   

35:11.643 --> 35:13.477
      and destroy it if I       
      try to skip town or       

35:13.479 --> 35:14.845
      do anything stupid.       

35:16.248 --> 35:18.148
       And I don't value        
       my life that much,       

35:19.418 --> 35:20.684
         I never have.          

35:22.121 --> 35:25.122
    But just so we're clear,    
    I'm not asking you.         

35:25.424 --> 35:26.523
        I'm telling you.        

35:27.392 --> 35:28.825
     I need a little time.      

35:29.695 --> 35:33.597
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

35:50.782 --> 35:52.315
  - Jimmy, what the fuck man?   

35:52.684 --> 35:54.584
- I need your help, I'm in deep.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.521
         - This is bad.         

35:58.524 --> 35:59.890
      This is really bad.       

36:00.259 --> 36:01.658
           - I know.            

36:01.660 --> 36:03.827
  I got caught up in this       
  shit and it's all fucked up.  

36:03.829 --> 36:05.362
          - What shit?          

36:05.364 --> 36:07.430
     Buy, sell organs on        
     the black market shit?     

36:07.432 --> 36:08.832
 - No, it's not my thing, it's. 

36:08.834 --> 36:10.233
   - Then what is your thing?   

36:10.669 --> 36:12.169
        - I boost cars!         

36:16.708 --> 36:18.375
   - I always knew you were     
   into some shady shit man,    

36:18.377 --> 36:19.743
      but this is serious.      

36:19.745 --> 36:20.911
           - I know!            

36:21.847 --> 36:23.613
      - That kidney             
      belongs to somebody       

36:23.615 --> 36:25.248
    and they're going to die    
    if they don't get it.       

36:25.250 --> 36:26.183
           - I know.            

36:26.752 --> 36:28.552
     - Then what the fuck?      

36:30.689 --> 36:32.789
    - I was hired to steal      
    this car for big money.     

36:32.791 --> 36:34.191
       I didn't know it         
       was in the trunk,        

36:34.192 --> 36:35.592
    I knew it was valuable,     
    I figured it was drugs.     

36:35.594 --> 36:36.860
             - And?             

36:37.396 --> 36:38.795
     - And during the boost     
     some guy shows up          

36:38.797 --> 36:40.697
    and puts a gun in my        
    face and I stab him man,    

36:40.699 --> 36:42.632
     I stab him in the neck     
     with a screwdriver.        

36:45.871 --> 36:47.337
   - Wait, wait, wait, wait,    

36:47.739 --> 36:48.972
       you stabbed a guy?       

36:49.608 --> 36:50.707
     - It was self defense!     

36:50.709 --> 36:52.776
    (dramatic string music)     

36:52.778 --> 36:54.311
 - Look, Jimmy, that's murder.  

36:54.313 --> 36:55.645
     - What are you doing?      

36:56.882 --> 36:57.981
        - I'm a cop man.        

36:58.850 --> 36:59.749
 I know that we got a history,  

36:59.751 --> 37:01.451
   but I got to take you in.    

37:01.853 --> 37:02.986
         - Take me in?          

37:02.988 --> 37:04.321
      I called you 'cause       
      I need you help!          

37:05.924 --> 37:07.324
 - Put your hands on your head. 

37:07.693 --> 37:09.226
  - Are you serious right now?  

37:09.228 --> 37:12.429
   Friendship, loyalty, does    
   that mean anything to you?   

37:12.431 --> 37:13.663
   We're practically family!    

37:14.466 --> 37:15.699
        - I know Jimmy.         

37:16.768 --> 37:18.235
      But I'm not one of        
      your lotus brothers       

37:18.237 --> 37:20.337
    and I certainly won't be    
    an accessory to murder.     

37:20.339 --> 37:21.938
       Now put your hands       
       behind your head!        

37:22.274 --> 37:23.006
             - No.              

37:23.642 --> 37:24.608
           (gunshot)            

37:24.610 --> 37:26.943
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

37:33.952 --> 37:35.652
            Come on.            

37:36.922 --> 37:39.289
   You made me do it man, I'm   
   not going to shoot you.      

37:41.860 --> 37:43.426
      I called you 'cause       
      I need your help          

37:43.428 --> 37:45.328
   and no one in this fucking   
   town's got my back.          

37:46.365 --> 37:48.965
  These guys want to kill me,   
  bad guys want to kill me.     

37:49.534 --> 37:51.635
   So you can either help me    
   survive the next 24 hours,   

37:51.637 --> 37:53.470
       and be part of the       
       solution, or not,        

37:53.472 --> 37:55.038
  and then you're just          
  another part of the problem.  

37:57.509 --> 37:59.042
     - Jimmy I'm a cop man.     

38:01.046 --> 38:02.912
  This could cost me my badge.  

38:03.915 --> 38:05.682
       This is my career.       

38:06.351 --> 38:07.917
- Then forget I ever called you.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.021
 - [Clyde] Jimmy I'm sorry man. 

38:11.023 --> 38:12.289
       - Fuck you Clyde.        

38:12.491 --> 38:14.958
     (somber string music)      

38:15.527 --> 38:17.627
        (engine rumbles)        

38:19.731 --> 38:20.830
         - Jimmy wait!          

38:20.832 --> 38:23.867
(suspenseful synthesizer music) 

38:29.608 --> 38:30.540
            - Boys!             

38:30.542 --> 38:32.042
- [Tommy] Shut the fuck up Roy. 

38:32.477 --> 38:33.410
             (thud)             

38:35.747 --> 38:38.948
        (distorted bass)        

38:38.950 --> 38:41.318
              Roy?              

38:41.620 --> 38:42.719
              Roy?              

38:43.388 --> 38:44.054
              Roy?              

38:44.056 --> 38:44.921
          - The fuck?           

38:44.923 --> 38:46.423
      - Roy listen to me.       

38:46.858 --> 38:49.859
   One of my guys got           
   stabbed in the neck today,   

38:49.861 --> 38:53.063
      with a screwdriver,       
      during your pickup.       

38:53.065 --> 38:54.597
    - You mean your pickup!     

38:54.933 --> 38:55.965
          (Roy yells)           

38:55.967 --> 38:59.703
     - Listen, our personal     
     stuff aside Roy,           

38:59.705 --> 39:02.072
    I trusted you again         
    and you have fucked me.     

39:02.607 --> 39:04.574
   So you got about 30          
   seconds to start talking,    

39:04.576 --> 39:07.544
   or I am going to make        
   your life miserable, huh?    

39:07.546 --> 39:08.411
    - I don't know anything!    

39:08.413 --> 39:09.079
           - Sledge.            

39:09.081 --> 39:09.946
             (thud)             

39:09.948 --> 39:11.381
           (coughing)           

39:11.382 --> 39:12.815
     You like to talk Roy,      
     everybody in town          

39:12.818 --> 39:15.085
     knows that you like to     
     talk, so talk to me.       

39:15.787 --> 39:17.020
              Huh?              

39:17.022 --> 39:18.488
     - Hey, I don't know        
     what you're talking--      

39:18.489 --> 39:19.955
      - Goddammit I don't       
      get people like you!      

39:20.125 --> 39:21.424
       You know what, you       
       just keep digging        

39:21.426 --> 39:22.592
    deeper and deeper right?    

39:22.594 --> 39:24.027
      You just won't look,      

39:24.029 --> 39:25.028
         grab his hand.         

39:25.030 --> 39:25.962
             (thud)             

39:25.964 --> 39:28.031
  You know what infuriates me?  

39:28.033 --> 39:29.899
 Is that think you're so smart, 

39:29.901 --> 39:31.534
      but you're not Roy,       
      and on top of that,       

39:31.536 --> 39:33.937
  you're a horrible liar, so    
  all that ends up happening,   

39:33.939 --> 39:37.540
    is you waste important      
    people's valuable time,     

39:37.542 --> 39:39.843
with all of your bullshit, huh? 

39:40.045 --> 39:41.511
     - [Roy] Wait, wait,        
     wait, what's he doing?     

39:41.513 --> 39:43.012
      - [Tommy] Every           
      time you lie to me,       

39:43.014 --> 39:44.481
      I'm going to rip out      
      one of your fucking       

39:44.483 --> 39:45.815
       fingernails, okay?       

39:45.817 --> 39:46.983
       So start talking!        

39:46.985 --> 39:48.151
      - Okay I'll tell you      
      everything I know!        

39:48.153 --> 39:49.786
       Wait, wait, wait!        

39:49.788 --> 39:51.154
  Okay, I'll tell you, I'll     
  tell you everything I know.   

39:51.523 --> 39:55.658
     Okay, word is, this        
     coked up kid, Austin.      

39:55.660 --> 39:57.026
He found out about the package. 

39:57.028 --> 39:58.745
      He must have thought      
      that it was like,         

39:58.746 --> 40:00.463
    a load of blow, because     
    that's his deal.            

40:00.465 --> 40:02.465
 Hey, hey, he lives in Vernon.  

40:03.101 --> 40:05.435
  - I know who Austin is Roy.   

40:05.837 --> 40:07.771
     But what that doesn't      
     account for is how         

40:07.773 --> 40:10.073
 Austin knew about the package, 

40:10.075 --> 40:11.474
      unless you told him!      

40:11.476 --> 40:14.477
      - I swear to God, I       
      didn't say a thing!       

40:14.479 --> 40:17.113
    He deals to the             
    Armenians, and he knows     

40:17.115 --> 40:18.648
 all the real border borthers!  

40:18.650 --> 40:19.949
      They must have            
      fond out something!       

40:19.951 --> 40:21.050
     I didn't say a thing.      

40:21.052 --> 40:23.153
    (ominous ambient music)     

40:23.955 --> 40:24.954
            I swear.            

40:34.566 --> 40:36.065
  - That is a great story Roy.  

40:36.067 --> 40:37.500
     That is a great story.     

40:37.903 --> 40:39.886
           You know?            

40:39.887 --> 40:41.870
 I guess a half truth is better 
 than no truth at all, so.      

40:43.475 --> 40:46.009
    I'm going to pay you for    
    that info, thank you.       

40:47.179 --> 40:48.778
   But you still owe me one.    

40:49.848 --> 40:52.682
          (screaming)           

40:52.951 --> 40:54.017
     I'm going to call you.     

40:54.786 --> 40:56.085
 Get your money for you, okay?  

40:56.087 --> 40:58.588
    (ominous ambient music)     

41:03.495 --> 41:05.962
         - God damnit!          

41:08.233 --> 41:11.468
- Listen, I'm going to need you 
to start from the beginning.    

41:12.037 --> 41:13.102
         I'm all ears.          

41:13.805 --> 41:15.972
    But if you want my help,    

41:15.974 --> 41:18.641
I need to know everything, okay?

41:21.513 --> 41:23.079
 - I don't know where to begin. 

41:26.985 --> 41:28.852
   - What about the guy that    
   put a gun up to your head    

41:28.854 --> 41:30.086
      in the parking lot?       

41:30.789 --> 41:32.055
      Did he say anything?      

41:32.924 --> 41:34.757
       - He asked me who        
       I was working for.       

41:37.028 --> 41:38.962
     He mentioned Lorenzo.      

41:39.998 --> 41:41.631
      - He said "Lorenzo?"      

41:44.002 --> 41:45.568
            Oh shit.            

41:46.071 --> 41:48.004
     He must be talking         
     about Lorenzo Champs.      

41:48.640 --> 41:49.606
         - Who's that?          

41:52.944 --> 41:54.177
  - He's a big time gangster.   

41:55.714 --> 41:57.981
    Runs a lot of operations    
    in and out of L.A.          

41:58.650 --> 42:00.250
      He's our west             
      coast kingpin, man.       

42:01.186 --> 42:03.586
 You know, we've been trying to 
 nail him down for years, but.  

42:03.588 --> 42:04.521
          - But what?           

42:05.991 --> 42:08.258
       - He's good Jimmy.       

42:08.960 --> 42:10.226
        He's real good.         

42:12.097 --> 42:13.696
     All of his businesses      
     are legit now.             

42:13.698 --> 42:14.898
      Except for the coke.      

42:17.168 --> 42:18.835
       - So what's he           
       want a kidney for?       

42:19.137 --> 42:20.870
        - Who knows man?        

42:22.207 --> 42:24.140
      People pay a lot of       
      money for the shit.       

42:25.176 --> 42:26.209
     - I just keep thinking     
     about that guy             

42:26.211 --> 42:27.877
    in the parking lot man.     

42:27.879 --> 42:29.913
    I didn't have a choice,     
    you got to believe me.      

42:32.017 --> 42:33.116
      - Oh I believe you.       

42:34.152 --> 42:36.286
   Now I need you to tell me    

42:36.855 --> 42:39.222
       exactly what it is       

42:39.224 --> 42:41.291
    that you want me to do.     

42:44.963 --> 42:47.730
       (seagulls calling)       

42:47.899 --> 42:51.234
    (ominous droning music)     

42:59.077 --> 43:00.577
      - You must be Jimmy.      

43:00.946 --> 43:02.078
     Come on in, have seat.     

43:02.080 --> 43:04.714
    (ominous droning music)     

43:12.724 --> 43:14.223
      You don't need that       
      pistol, cowboy.           

43:14.225 --> 43:15.592
  - I'll be the judge of that.  

43:15.594 --> 43:17.694
   - We're on the same side.    

43:20.131 --> 43:21.731
      So where's this box?      

43:21.733 --> 43:22.932
   I want to see this thing.    

43:24.903 --> 43:26.102
        - It ain't far.         

43:26.104 --> 43:27.770
       Where's my money?        

43:27.772 --> 43:30.640
  - You'll get your money when  
  you deliver the package.      

43:30.642 --> 43:32.275
     So if there's someone      
     you need to call,          

43:32.277 --> 43:33.643
   now would be a good time.    

43:33.645 --> 43:35.111
      - No, we'll wait          
      'till Roy gets here,      

43:35.113 --> 43:36.813
     then I make that call,     
     and I decide how this      

43:36.815 --> 43:38.348
   is going to work together.   

43:38.683 --> 43:40.049
         - Okie dokie.          

43:41.186 --> 43:42.752
    I'm Crystal by the way.     

43:44.356 --> 43:46.356
       Your services are        
       much appreciated.        

43:46.825 --> 43:48.658
 Roy spoke very highly of you.  

43:48.960 --> 43:50.093
         - That a fact?         

43:51.663 --> 43:52.962
       - So you thirsty?        

43:53.331 --> 43:55.031
   Care for a tasty beverage?   

43:58.770 --> 44:00.069
        Or maybe a bump?        

44:00.071 --> 44:01.771
     - No thanks, I had a       
     pretty rough morning.      

44:02.807 --> 44:05.241
   - Yea, I heard about that.   

44:07.245 --> 44:08.344
             Sorry.             

44:10.081 --> 44:11.948
     Could you please stop      
     pointing that at me?       

44:12.651 --> 44:14.751
     I'm a girl, it's rude.     

44:15.320 --> 44:16.386
        (lighter clicks)        

44:18.390 --> 44:19.989
        - [Jimmy] So how        
        do you know Roy?        

44:22.394 --> 44:24.093
      Everyone knows Roy.       

44:24.095 --> 44:25.428
      - Wasn't he supposed      
      to be here by now?        

44:25.797 --> 44:28.364
  - Dude, relax, you're tense.  

44:31.770 --> 44:33.102
  You're kind of cute though.   

44:35.273 --> 44:36.239
        Where you from?         

44:36.241 --> 44:37.240
           - Detroit.           

44:40.011 --> 44:41.210
     - Yea, I can see that.     

44:41.212 --> 44:42.945
   You kind of got that whole   

44:43.114 --> 44:45.081
 trashy urban guy thing going.  

44:45.383 --> 44:46.949
     - Yea, where you from?     

44:49.421 --> 44:50.420
          - The Hills.          

44:53.024 --> 44:54.157
      Oh, do you want one?      

44:54.159 --> 44:56.192
        (dramatic bass)         

44:56.394 --> 44:58.394
      Mellow the fuck out!      

44:58.830 --> 45:00.229
       You just made a          
       shit ton of money,       

45:00.231 --> 45:02.198
     and as soon as you         
     deliver your package,      

45:02.934 --> 45:04.400
all's going to end well for you.

45:08.139 --> 45:09.439
     How about that drink?      

45:10.241 --> 45:12.075
      - I don't like this,      
      you're stalling!          

45:12.077 --> 45:13.042
          - Excuse me?          

45:13.044 --> 45:14.343
  - Where's my fucking money?   

45:14.345 --> 45:17.313
    - I don't like your         
    tone Jimmy from Detroit.    

45:17.315 --> 45:18.665
      - Well I almost           
      got killed earlier,       

45:18.666 --> 45:20.016
     so don't really give       
     a shit what you think.     

45:20.018 --> 45:21.217
 Now where's my fucking money?  

45:22.353 --> 45:24.420
       - Alright, you           
       left me no choice.       

45:25.156 --> 45:26.355
 - [Jimmy] What are you doing?  

45:26.357 --> 45:28.424
      - Helping you relax.      

45:29.194 --> 45:31.828
  (sensual synthesizer music)   

45:37.268 --> 45:38.434
           (laughter)           

45:38.803 --> 45:41.270
      You really are new        
      at this, aren't you?      

45:43.441 --> 45:46.342
     Now take one more          
     step, and I'll shoot.      

45:47.011 --> 45:48.010
             Baby!              

45:48.313 --> 45:49.512
     You can come out now!      

45:49.514 --> 45:52.482
  (sensual synthesizer music)   

45:53.251 --> 45:56.419
          (whistling)           

46:02.427 --> 46:05.428
        (knife clicking)        

46:06.264 --> 46:09.899
      (tense string music)      

46:33.925 --> 46:34.957
       - [Lorenzo] What?        

46:36.361 --> 46:37.360
           - Nothing.           

46:40.532 --> 46:42.398
- Have a soft spot for the kid? 

46:43.868 --> 46:45.168
       - Yea, I guess so.       

46:45.170 --> 46:47.003
     (gentle string music)      

46:48.473 --> 46:50.039
  - What was I supposed to do?  

46:50.375 --> 46:51.541
          Let him go?           

46:52.177 --> 46:53.509
      - No, I don't know.       

46:54.979 --> 46:57.313
     It just, this doesn't      
     feel right, you know?      

46:57.315 --> 46:58.548
    - [Lorenzo] It happens.     

46:58.550 --> 46:59.448
     - Yea, but not like        
     this, and when the kid     

46:59.450 --> 47:01.050
  did the right thing Lorenzo.  

47:04.322 --> 47:05.955
      - Maybe in the end,       

47:06.257 --> 47:08.124
      he got mixed up with      
      the wrong people.         

47:08.259 --> 47:09.892
  Roy, that weirdo coke head.   

47:09.894 --> 47:11.394
           - Austin.            

47:11.396 --> 47:14.063
   - Nobody with half a brain   
   would work for that guy.     

47:14.532 --> 47:16.465
    - Yea, I don't think he     
    was working with Austin.    

47:16.935 --> 47:19.435
     I mean, Roy maybe, but     
     he didn't know Austin      

47:19.437 --> 47:20.970
     from a hole in the         
     wall, I mean that guy      

47:20.971 --> 47:22.504
    was cutting his face up     
    when we went in there.      

47:22.974 --> 47:24.907
         (static hiss)          

47:27.912 --> 47:30.613
   (ominous bass percussion)    

47:43.895 --> 47:45.328
    - [Tommy] Jesus Christ.     

47:46.497 --> 47:48.197
          - It's you.           

47:51.636 --> 47:53.936
  - [Tommy] What the fuck is    
  the matter with you Austin?   

47:56.341 --> 47:58.608
     - Are you really going     
     to lecture me old man?     

48:00.378 --> 48:02.445
   - Look, what's up with       
   the sense of entitlement?    

48:02.881 --> 48:04.113
              Huh?              

48:04.515 --> 48:05.514
       I mean, didn't we        
       talk about this?         

48:05.516 --> 48:06.649
One day I'm going to be too old 

48:06.651 --> 48:08.618
     and too tired to deal      
     with this bullshit?        

48:09.120 --> 48:11.654
     And then it was going      
     to be Austin's time.       

48:12.156 --> 48:13.656
      Right, but you            
      couldn't wait, huh?       

48:13.658 --> 48:16.259
       You just insist on       
       disrespecting me         

48:16.261 --> 48:19.328
 over and over and over again.  

48:19.497 --> 48:21.230
      - Disrespecting you?      

48:21.466 --> 48:24.500
      I'm just trying to        
      expand my business.       

48:24.903 --> 48:26.269
    If you were in my shoes,    
    you would be doing          

48:26.271 --> 48:28.271
     the exact same thing.      

48:30.408 --> 48:31.607
         - Fair enough.         

48:32.577 --> 48:34.577
However, if I want someone dead,

48:34.579 --> 48:37.046
     I get them dead, and       
     I make damn well sure      

48:37.048 --> 48:39.215
   they know it was me, that    
   wanted them that way.        

48:39.217 --> 48:40.616
    You idiots, you get         
    involved in shit without    

48:40.618 --> 48:43.619
any concept of cause and effect.

48:46.357 --> 48:48.057
         - Wow, you...          

48:48.326 --> 48:51.694
    Do realize we're talking    
    about drug trafficking?     

48:51.696 --> 48:54.597
   Transporting human organs    
   on the black market          

48:54.599 --> 48:55.531
          and murder?           

48:56.367 --> 49:00.002
 This isn't Sicily circa 1940.  

49:00.405 --> 49:02.305
  We're not in The Godfather.   

49:02.307 --> 49:04.607
  Some stupid gangster movie.   

49:04.609 --> 49:07.310
  Okay, I saw an opportunity.   

49:07.645 --> 49:09.445
       It's that simple.        

49:10.181 --> 49:14.517
 And when Lorenzo's body is     
 drained and cold in the Earth, 

49:14.519 --> 49:18.521
    no one is going to gove     
    a shit how it happened.     

49:18.523 --> 49:21.524
    (ominous ambient music)     

49:24.595 --> 49:26.228
     - [Tommy] I guess you      
     didn't see all the         

49:26.230 --> 49:28.497
       guys in nice suits       
       with huge guns.          

49:31.536 --> 49:32.535
             Okay.              

49:32.537 --> 49:33.569
I'm going to explain it to you. 

49:33.571 --> 49:36.272
      There's a gulf here,      
      there's a divide.         

49:36.274 --> 49:37.740
  A great divide, if you will.  

49:38.142 --> 49:40.543
     On the one side you        
     got classy gentlemen,      

49:40.545 --> 49:43.212
     that get nice              
     things, cars, houses.      

49:43.414 --> 49:46.148
       Beautiful women,         
       big bank accounts.       

49:46.617 --> 49:48.150
         Fillet Mignon.         

49:48.319 --> 49:50.720
    Manicured lawns, and we     
    get to have those things    

49:50.722 --> 49:52.655
        because well, we        
        live by a creed.        

49:53.091 --> 49:55.024
  A sense of civility, right?   

49:55.026 --> 49:56.692
     And then on the other      
     side, there's you.         

49:58.396 --> 49:59.695
     You're a fuck up, man.     

49:59.697 --> 50:01.097
      You're a psychopath.      

50:01.099 --> 50:03.499
    You make bad decisions,     
    both personally,            

50:04.068 --> 50:06.569
     and businesswise, that     
     affect other people.       

50:07.405 --> 50:09.005
     You have no reverence      
     for the game               

50:09.007 --> 50:10.439
    and you played it wrong.    

50:10.441 --> 50:12.308
   You're lost in the woods     
   without a compass Austin,    

50:12.310 --> 50:14.176
      and do you know           
      where that gets you?      

50:16.514 --> 50:18.714
       - Lorenzo doesn't        
       have the kidney.         

50:19.050 --> 50:21.717
    Okay, and time's            
    running out, right, huh?    

50:23.488 --> 50:25.654
      Jimmy here is             
      working with a cop.       

50:26.657 --> 50:29.458
      And he's the one who      
      has the package, so.      

50:29.627 --> 50:30.593
        - Is that right?        

50:33.598 --> 50:34.764
        - That's right.         

50:35.199 --> 50:36.132
            Ask him.            

50:36.134 --> 50:37.400
  - [Tommy] Is that true kid?   

50:43.307 --> 50:45.775
       - You really going       
       to shoot me Tommy?       

50:47.612 --> 50:49.478
      Wouldn't Lorenzo          
      rather whack the guy      

50:49.480 --> 50:50.780
       who sold him out?        

50:51.416 --> 50:52.715
  That would make sense to me.  

50:52.717 --> 50:55.251
    (ominous ambient music)     

51:01.626 --> 51:03.592
    - Austin, you are a         
    tragic character in this    

51:03.594 --> 51:05.394
    play of fools, brother.     

51:06.464 --> 51:07.663
         - How's that?          

51:09.133 --> 51:10.699
 - Because you played it wrong. 

51:13.738 --> 51:15.271
         - Killing me,          

51:15.273 --> 51:17.540
   would be bad for business.   

51:18.576 --> 51:20.409
    I move too much product.    

51:24.315 --> 51:25.614
         - That's true.         

51:26.851 --> 51:28.684
      However, that's why       
      these guys are here.      

51:30.855 --> 51:33.689
    (ominous ambient music)     

51:33.691 --> 51:34.623
            Sledge.             

51:34.625 --> 51:36.225
    (ominous ambient music)     

51:36.227 --> 51:37.593
           - No, no!            

51:38.096 --> 51:38.861
              No!               

51:39.197 --> 51:40.362
   You don't have to do this!   

51:40.364 --> 51:41.430
           Tommy, no!           

51:41.833 --> 51:42.765
             Baby!              

51:43.701 --> 51:44.700
              No!               

51:45.336 --> 51:46.502
           (screams)            

51:46.504 --> 51:48.437
    (ominous ambient music)     

51:48.439 --> 51:49.738
   - You were just too eager.   

51:49.740 --> 51:51.841
    (ominous ambient music)     

51:53.878 --> 51:54.777
            (crack)             

51:54.779 --> 51:56.879
        (Austin gagging)        

51:59.350 --> 52:00.282
    Will you untie the kid?     

52:00.284 --> 52:01.183
Let's get the fuck out of here. 

52:01.185 --> 52:03.552
    (ominous ambient music)     

52:08.726 --> 52:10.559
     - So, no more Austin.      

52:10.561 --> 52:12.495
     - Yea, good riddance.      

52:12.496 --> 52:14.430
   Wish I'd taken care of the   
   whacko a long time ago.      

52:15.366 --> 52:17.466
 - These things play out Tommy, 

52:17.468 --> 52:18.634
   that's just the way it is.   

52:18.636 --> 52:20.202
       - No, I know, but        
       I don't like it.         

52:20.203 --> 52:21.769
      I mean Roy's the one      
      that made this mess.      

52:24.809 --> 52:26.509
  - He wanted the guy whacked,  

52:26.511 --> 52:28.644
   just think of this as part   
   of the payment process.      

52:28.646 --> 52:30.579
   - But even if that's true,   

52:30.581 --> 52:31.847
     what, we're just happy     
     to have the Armenians      

52:31.849 --> 52:33.549
      do Roy's dirty work?      

52:33.684 --> 52:34.717
     - Doesn't matter now.      

52:37.688 --> 52:39.388
      - Alright, so let me      
      get this straight.        

52:39.824 --> 52:41.340
Even thought you and I both know

52:41.341 --> 52:42.857
       that it was Roy          
       that sold us out,        

52:45.496 --> 52:46.829
      you're not thinking       
      what I'm thinking?        

52:47.798 --> 52:48.831
          - No Tommy.           

52:50.835 --> 52:52.768
  You know we can't touch him.  

52:54.672 --> 52:56.639
      This'll blow the lid      
      off the whole thing.      

52:57.775 --> 52:59.241
Got a lot of things on my mind, 

52:59.242 --> 53:00.708
     the last thing I need      
     is some bigger problem     

53:00.711 --> 53:01.777
      south of the border.      

53:01.779 --> 53:02.945
           - Come on.           

53:02.947 --> 53:04.747
       - This isn't open        
       for discussion!          

53:07.185 --> 53:08.184
           - Alright.           

53:09.787 --> 53:10.953
        How's she doing?        

53:12.890 --> 53:14.190
          - We'll see.          

53:15.860 --> 53:18.794
       (heartbeat effect)       

53:20.298 --> 53:23.832
     (somber string music)      

53:26.470 --> 53:28.204
           (sobbing)            

53:28.206 --> 53:31.273
     (somber string music)      

54:07.745 --> 54:09.812
           (banging)            

54:09.814 --> 54:13.315
     (somber string music)      

54:17.989 --> 54:19.455
            - Jimmy.            

54:19.890 --> 54:21.657
     What the fuck happened     
     to your face man?          

54:21.659 --> 54:22.658
         - Where is it?         

54:22.860 --> 54:23.726
 - [Clyde] It's in the kitchen. 

54:23.728 --> 54:24.960
    - if I'm not back later,    

54:24.962 --> 54:27.730
    you need to give this to    
    my girl Shereen, okay?      

54:30.568 --> 54:31.800
      Here's her address.       

54:32.403 --> 54:33.969
       Promise me you'll        
       give it to her!          

54:35.806 --> 54:36.672
            - Jesus.            

54:36.674 --> 54:38.140
         - Promise me!          

54:38.141 --> 54:39.607
       - Jesus, I promise       
       man, I promise!          

54:39.610 --> 54:41.844
    (ominous ambient music)     

54:45.816 --> 54:48.751
       (engine rumbling)        

54:51.989 --> 54:54.323
    (ominous ambient music)     

55:16.814 --> 55:17.913
          (gun cocks)           

55:17.915 --> 55:18.981
           (gunshot)            

55:22.920 --> 55:24.019
      - Take care of this.      

55:24.021 --> 55:26.822
    (ominous ambient music)     

55:37.468 --> 55:40.903
      (gentle piano music)      

55:47.411 --> 55:51.080
        (puppies crying)        

55:53.017 --> 55:53.916
- [Jimmy] What would you do with

55:53.918 --> 55:54.983
   a few hundred grand, baby?   

55:56.821 --> 55:57.986
            - What?             

55:58.489 --> 55:59.655
      - [Jimmy] What            
      would you do with a       

55:59.657 --> 56:01.690
      few hundred grand,        
      if you go it today?       

56:02.593 --> 56:03.759
          Or tomorrow?          

56:03.961 --> 56:05.928
      (gentle piano music)      

56:05.930 --> 56:06.995
        - I don't know.         

56:07.698 --> 56:08.997
Put it down on a house, I guess.

56:11.001 --> 56:12.568
      I have no idea, why?      

56:12.737 --> 56:13.936
   - [Jimmy] Just wondering.    

56:16.574 --> 56:17.940
       - I would put some       
       money away for           

56:17.942 --> 56:20.075
   Mickey's college, I          
   would definitely do that.    

56:20.678 --> 56:22.544
        (bacon sizzling)        

56:22.546 --> 56:23.912
 - [Jimmy] I would start a lot. 

56:25.416 --> 56:26.915
  - What, like a parking lot?   

56:27.551 --> 56:28.650
       - [Jimmy] No, like       
       a used car lot.          

56:28.652 --> 56:30.052
   I would buy and sell cars.   

56:33.958 --> 56:35.291
 Maybe I'd take you on a trip.  

56:35.292 --> 56:36.625
  I hear Pontiac, Michigan's    
  beautiful this time of year.  

56:36.627 --> 56:37.960
      - [Shereen] Let's go      
      to the East Coast.        

56:37.962 --> 56:38.827
          - Let's go.           

56:38.829 --> 56:40.996
      (gentle piano music)      

56:41.732 --> 56:43.999
 Mm, this bacon's so good baby. 

56:44.802 --> 56:45.834
         - You like it?         

56:46.437 --> 56:47.970
     - I'm in love with it.     

56:48.139 --> 56:49.938
     Almost as much as you.     

56:51.142 --> 56:52.040
  - You don't need money when   

56:52.042 --> 56:53.809
   bacon makes you so happy.    

56:54.712 --> 56:55.944
         - Damn right.          

56:59.984 --> 57:01.984
       I was going down         
       to Alvera Street,        

57:01.986 --> 57:03.752
       and I saw it and         
       I thought of you.        

57:04.588 --> 57:05.721
          You like it?          

57:06.190 --> 57:07.189
          - I love it.          

57:07.191 --> 57:09.558
      (gentle piano music)      

57:15.699 --> 57:16.698
        - [Jimmy] What?         

57:16.967 --> 57:18.133
           - Nothing.           

57:18.903 --> 57:20.169
   - Then what's the problem?   

57:21.439 --> 57:22.805
     - It makes me feel         
     uncomfortable when you     

57:22.807 --> 57:24.173
     look at me like that.      

57:25.810 --> 57:27.543
     - You're going to have     
     to explain that to me.     

57:27.545 --> 57:29.478
      (gentle piano music)      

57:30.714 --> 57:32.047
            (sighs)             

57:34.685 --> 57:36.051
      - I love you Jimmy.       

57:37.988 --> 57:39.121
             I do.              

57:41.559 --> 57:42.658
            I just.             

57:43.928 --> 57:45.060
          - Just what?          

57:49.834 --> 57:51.133
   - Let me tell you a story.   

57:55.940 --> 57:57.440
   When I was a little girl,    

57:57.441 --> 57:58.941
       I went to visit my       
       family in Mexico.        

58:01.045 --> 58:02.644
      And that summer           
      they had this goat.       

58:04.114 --> 58:05.581
          On the farm.          

58:07.051 --> 58:09.017
      I loved little Billy      
      more than anything.       

58:10.054 --> 58:11.053
       He was black and         
       white, and used to       

58:11.055 --> 58:12.821
     follow me everywhere.      

58:14.191 --> 58:15.891
       I was only five          
       years old, and I'd       

58:15.893 --> 58:17.593
  never been on a farm before.  

58:18.496 --> 58:19.862
     So I didn't understand     
     that they would            

58:19.864 --> 58:22.531
     raise a goat once a        
     year, to be harvested      

58:22.533 --> 58:25.167
    in the Fall, for the        
    festival to make berria.    

58:26.270 --> 58:28.103
     One day, I was             
     called to the corral,      

58:28.105 --> 58:29.705
as everyone else in the family. 

58:30.975 --> 58:32.641
     We gather around, and,     

58:33.177 --> 58:35.277
  we watched as my              
  grandfather slaughtered him.  

58:37.147 --> 58:38.814
      Being so young, I         
      had no idea this was      

58:38.816 --> 58:40.249
     going to happen, so...     

58:42.052 --> 58:43.519
            I was...            

58:43.521 --> 58:45.187
Desperate and I started to cry. 

58:46.724 --> 58:48.657
       As my grandfather        
       cut his throat.          

58:50.794 --> 58:52.127
     When he heard my           
     cries, the poor billy      

58:52.129 --> 58:54.830
     became distressed          
     and started to panic,      

58:55.933 --> 58:58.100
   and struggle for his life.   

58:59.603 --> 59:01.203
  - He was being slaughtered.   

59:02.106 --> 59:03.105
             - No.              

59:04.808 --> 59:06.108
        That wasn't it.         

59:08.879 --> 59:11.547
      Everyone else,            
      including the goat,       

59:11.782 --> 59:14.049
      up to that point,         
      were extremely calm.      

59:15.152 --> 59:17.052
       It was actually          
       me who scared him.       

59:18.756 --> 59:20.656
My Tia grabbed my hand and said,

59:20.791 --> 59:21.890
         "Let him go."          

59:22.293 --> 59:24.192
 "Your fears are scaring him."  

59:25.129 --> 59:26.995
"His life was not meant for you,

59:26.997 --> 59:28.230
  "he doesn't belong to you."   

59:28.966 --> 59:31.166
    "His life was meant for     
    a different purpose."       

59:32.236 --> 59:35.070
       "He gives his body       
       and blood to us,         

59:35.072 --> 59:36.838
       "and we thank him        
       by honoring him          

59:36.840 --> 59:38.106
      "for his sacrifice."      

59:38.108 --> 59:40.309
     (gentle string music)      

59:41.312 --> 59:43.245
    At first I was confused.    

59:45.950 --> 59:47.049
     But then I understood.     

59:47.051 --> 59:50.252
     (gentle string music)      

59:51.221 --> 59:53.121
   And my empathy evaporated,   

59:53.757 --> 59:55.591
 and I realized she was right.  

59:57.895 --> 59:59.628
       It was me who was        
       keeping him here.        

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:05.167
     - So what did you do?      

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:07.603
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:13.008
           (sobbing)            

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.248
        - I let him go.         

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:24.786
            (sighs)             

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:27.289
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:32.894
           Thank you.           

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:35.330
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:47.409
           (humming)            

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.264
      - Hey man, I got to       
      ask you something.        

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:11.133
             - Hm?              

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:13.702
      - You consider Pizza      
      Hut a pizzeria?           

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:19.174
        - I don't know.         

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.110
  - I'm asking you a question.  

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:23.812
           Yes or no?           

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:35.390
    - No, I don't think         
    Pizza Hut is a pizzeria.    

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:36.958
             - No?              

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:39.027
   They serve fucking pizza.    

01:01:39.263 --> 01:01:40.462
            - Okay.             

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:42.330
      You know, I went          
      there the other day       

01:01:42.332 --> 01:01:43.899
     and got in an argument     
     with the waitress.         

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:45.333
    I asked for two slices.     

01:01:46.737 --> 01:01:48.270
        She says, "No."         

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:51.273
    - I don't think they        
    do slices at Pizza Hut.     

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:52.340
    - That's not the point.     

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:55.043
     The point is, I            
     asked for two slices,      

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.779
    she goes, "What do we       
    look like, a pizzeria?"     

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.715
     Now tell me that           
     wouldn't piss you off.     

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:03.719
     - Got to work on your      
     anger management.          

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:05.387
    - Yea, anger management.    

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:06.388
           - Breathe.           

01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:09.758
   - Take it in, let it out.    

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:10.992
      Pop her in the face.      

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:12.160
           (chuckles)           

01:02:14.798 --> 01:02:16.131
   What's the plan here, man?   

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:21.203
     - Keri's going to pull     
     up, drop the car off,      

01:02:22.172 --> 01:02:24.139
     he's going to be           
     under the wheel well,      

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:25.741
    package is in the back.     

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.342
    - Under the wheel well,     
    or on the wheel well?       

01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:28.911
      - [Tommy] It's            
      under the wheel well      

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.479

       hide-a-key thing.

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:33.815
  - Know what a hide-a-key is?  

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:35.917
    Little fucking black

    - A fucking hide-a-key.     

01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:45.861
        - I'll find it.

    - Got those hide-a-keys     
    that got those              

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:48.831
    little fake rocks, you      
    never seen those shits?     

01:02:48.832 --> 01:02:50.532

   we got no fake rocks.        

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:52.134
       (tires squealing)        

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:53.969
      I'll find it though.      

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:02.544

       (cell phone rings)       

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:33.588
            - Hello?            

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:36.124
         - Who is this?         

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:39.394
         - Who's this?          

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.396
     - This is the guy          
     that knows that you're     

01:06:41.398 --> 01:06:44.599
    speaking on a dead man's    
    cell phone, that's who.     

01:06:46.103 --> 01:06:48.169
     Some stunt you pulled      
     back there kid.            

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.339
      - What do you want?       

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:54.509
           Big Tommy?           

01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:58.747
       - Alright, listen.       

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:01.616
     Before you and I get       
     off on the wrong foot,     

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:03.151
       I'm going to give        
       you an opportunity       

01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:04.486
       to set this right.       

01:07:04.654 --> 01:07:06.204
Under normal circumstances, that

01:07:06.205 --> 01:07:07.755
   wouldn't exist for someone   
   in your predicament.         

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:10.625
       Right, but this          
       shit is personal.        

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:14.763
     Keep in mind that the      
     man that I work for,       

01:07:14.765 --> 01:07:16.398
       he's not going to        
       stop until you are       

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.067
  cut into little tiny pieces.  

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:20.769
      - You think I don't       
      know that already?        

01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:21.736
     - Well then what's it      
     going to take for you      

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:23.438
   to bring me back the car?    

01:07:23.774 --> 01:07:25.440
    - Don't you mean kidney?    

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:29.711
   That's not going to happen   
   until I have my money.       

01:07:33.316 --> 01:07:35.216
 - How much did they offer you? 

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:41.389
          - 250 grand.          

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:44.359
        - I'll match it.        

01:07:46.329 --> 01:07:47.429
            - Go on.            

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.699
- I want to know who hired you. 

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:55.637
     - I'm not saying           
     anything until I have      

01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:56.805
      my insurance policy.      

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:01.142
    - Well, you're going to     
    need more than that kid.    

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:03.711
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.182
      - What do you mean?       

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:08.783
    - It's going to take        
    more than a simple trade    

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:11.686
   to set this straight, you    
   killed one of our guys.      

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:13.154
            Alright?            

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:14.389
      That being said,          
      there's going to be       

01:08:14.391 --> 01:08:16.424
    a price on your head,       
    people are going to die.    

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:17.826
    If you want to get this     
    straight, you and I,        

01:08:17.828 --> 01:08:19.594
      we're going to have       
      to work together          

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.595
     so that means that we      
     will have to establish     

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:23.131
          some trust.           

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:24.732
            Alright?            

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:28.736
 I want to know who hired you.  

01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:30.839
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:37.377
      - I'll call you back      
      in a half an hour.        

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.779
      In the mean time,         
      you can talk to Roy.      

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:42.684
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:08:52.362 --> 01:08:55.697
       (heavy breathing)        

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:59.399
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.907
  - Now I need you to tell me   

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:10.278
    exactly what it is          
    that you want me to do.     

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:13.314
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:15.884
         - Nothing yet.         

01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:17.585
    I just need the package.    

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:19.787
       Some place safe          
       for my protection.       

01:09:20.457 --> 01:09:22.790
   Just go home and hang        
   tight, and I'll call you.    

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:26.560
     - Okay, but I thought      
     you wanted my help         

01:09:26.563 --> 01:09:27.828
        with these guys.        

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.666
       - The only thing         
       I need now is for        

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.800
      the package to be         
      some place safe with      

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.636
      someone I can trust.      

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.505
 Can you do that for me Clyde?  

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:40.207
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:42.877
             - Yea.             

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:45.345
      Yea, I can do that.       

01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:47.749
       - Then I need to         
       make a phone call.       

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:51.953
          (screaming)           

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:53.388
     - I'm gonna call you,      

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:55.356
 get your money for you, okay?  

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.393
              Bye.              

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:02.530
       That motherfucker.       

01:10:03.433 --> 01:10:04.666
        - [Sledge] Yea.         

01:10:05.335 --> 01:10:06.568
       What are you going       
       to to about it?          

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:11.739
  - I'm a lead the kid there,   

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:13.341
     and let him handle it.     

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:14.542
        That's the plan.        

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.843
      (cell phone buzzes)       

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:17.445
          Here he is.           

01:10:18.481 --> 01:10:20.215
You want your money, don't you? 

01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:21.516
         - [Jimmy] Yea.         

01:10:21.518 --> 01:10:22.684
     - Then you're going to     
     have to go in there,       

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:23.985
       and you're going         
       to have to get it.       

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:26.588
      Alright, that's the       
      deal we're making.        

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:30.358
Look, we'll be right behind you.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:32.860
      Okay, as soon as the      
      Armenians get here,       

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:33.928
    we're going to swoop in.    

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:36.698
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:41.402
   (dramatic swelling effect)   

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:42.270
           (gunshot)            

01:10:42.272 --> 01:10:43.338
       - [Crystal] Baby?        

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.505
     You can come out now.      

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:47.508
           (yelling)            

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:48.543
      - [Austin] You'll         
      only make it worse!       

01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:50.912
           (yelling)            

01:10:51.715 --> 01:10:53.314
           (yelling)            

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:54.749
           (yelling)            

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:55.750
           (yelling)            

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:59.687
           (yelling)            

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:03.024
        Is it the pain?         

01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:06.761
     Or the horror of being     
     maimed that's worse?       

01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:10.698
      - You're a monster!       

01:11:12.636 --> 01:11:13.968
        - I'm an artist.        

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:16.571
            (crying)            

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:19.007
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:25.613
  You know why I'm an artist?   

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:31.452
      It's because the          
      lines you can draw.       

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:34.522
     The layers of a person     

01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:36.724
       you can peel away.       

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:37.992
         Like an onion.         

01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:41.529
   If it's (mumbles) enough,    

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:43.031
         you see steam          

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.833
      rising off of them.       

01:11:47.604 --> 01:11:49.771
         All that heat.         

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:53.441
         All that life.         

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:55.910
           Literally.           

01:11:57.047 --> 01:11:58.746
          Evaporating.          

01:11:58.748 --> 01:12:00.748
           (sobbing)            

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:02.817
       I feel its fever.        

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:05.386
           (sobbing)            

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:07.722
       - [Jimmy] Help me!       

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:09.791
         Help, help me!         

01:12:10.727 --> 01:12:12.460
 - You can scream all you want, 

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:16.764
      nobody can hear you!      

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:18.900
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:22.603
           (sobbing)            

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:23.805
             Ready?             

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.073
              Huh?              

01:12:25.075 --> 01:12:25.940
            - Wait!             

01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:26.874
    Wait, wait, wait, wait!     

01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:27.742
    Wait, wait, wait, wait!     

01:12:27.744 --> 01:12:28.743
     - [Austin] Baby, baby!     

01:12:28.745 --> 01:12:29.844
   This is my favorite part.    

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:31.512
           (laughter)           

01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:35.049
            - Baby?             

01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:37.618
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.357
    - Gevorg, what the fuck?    

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:44.792
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:12:56.473 --> 01:13:00.007
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.944
      - What the fuck,          
      where were you guys?      

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.013
   - We had to wait for the     
   cavalry to show up Jimmy.    

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:09.917
       - So what's next,        
       what are we doing?       

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:12.120
     - You're going to take     
     the money to Roy's.        

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.091
    Look, I promised him        
    the money for the info.     

01:13:19.963 --> 01:13:21.796
       Then we ripped his       
       fingernail out.          

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:25.733
Then I guess you could say that 

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:27.635
     I needed an                
     insurance policy too.      

01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:30.405
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:13:44.988 --> 01:13:46.087
           Thank you.           

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.054
        I appreciate it.        

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:48.489
   I'll call you later okay?    

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:49.924
            Thanks.             

01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:59.434
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:14:03.072 --> 01:14:04.472
  You alright with this, huh?   

01:14:04.474 --> 01:14:07.175
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:14:09.846 --> 01:14:11.913
     - So basically I have      
     to convince this guy       

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:14.048
       that I'm going to        
       give up my life,         

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:15.516
    and give him the kidney?    

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.686
         - [Tommy] Yea.         

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:21.022
           Basically.           

01:14:23.026 --> 01:14:24.525
  - What if he doesn't buy it?  

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:28.763
  - Look Jimmy, just play it    
  like we talked about, okay?   

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:31.132
   Assure him, reassure him.    

01:14:31.568 --> 01:14:32.800
         Convince him.          

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:35.837
      - He's just going to      
      give me 150 grand?        

01:14:35.839 --> 01:14:38.072
 - Yea, if you can convince him 
 that you're willing to die.    

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.074
     I think he will, yes.      

01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:43.144
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:14:44.948 --> 01:14:46.147
     You can do this Jimmy.     

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:49.584
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:53.087
      - And I don't value       
      my life that much,        

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:54.755
         I never have.          

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:56.591
    But just so we're clear,    

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:57.892
      I'm not asking you,       

01:14:58.061 --> 01:14:59.260
        I'm telling you.        

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:00.828
     I need a little time.      

01:15:02.532 --> 01:15:05.233
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:18.279
   - He needs a little money,   

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:19.780
 and you're going to drive him. 

01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:23.117
- And we'll just meet back here?

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:24.752
       - [Lorenzo] Yea.         
            - Okay.             

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:27.255
We're going to let him keep it? 

01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:30.291
      - What do you think?      

01:15:30.293 --> 01:15:32.760
    (tense orchestral music)    

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.930
      - I don't know, he        
      seems alright to me.      

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:40.067
And if he brings us the package.

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:43.170
       - Shame it had to        
       go down like this.       

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:44.238
             - Yea.             

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.040
    (tense orchestral music)    

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:51.646
    Could have been any of      
    us back in the day, huh?    

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:53.981
        - But it wasn't.        

01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:57.151
    (tense orchestral music)    

01:15:57.854 --> 01:15:59.153
  - Alright, well I should go.  

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:01.773
         - If the kid,          

01:16:01.774 --> 01:16:03.324
     so much as hints that      
     he's going to book,        

01:16:03.993 --> 01:16:04.959
            do him.             

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:06.027
            - Okay.             

01:16:06.029 --> 01:16:06.994
      - You got two hours.      

01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:09.196
     I'll go get the money.     

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:11.632
    (tense orchestral music)    

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:20.007
      (crickets chirping)       

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:20.975
  - So you talked to your guy,  

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:22.310
      he knows what to do?      

01:16:22.946 --> 01:16:24.345
- I told him exactly what to do.

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:27.715
- But I mean, you're confident? 

01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:29.249
   I mean you trust him that    
   he can do this, right?       

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:32.153
      - He said he would.       

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:33.020
       - Alright, but,          
       you know, this has       

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:34.188
    got to look real Jimmy.     

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:35.289
       If this is going         
       to work, you know,       

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:36.924
     for both of us, okay?      

01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:39.927
     - Don't worry, this        
     guy's a perfectionist.     

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.863
     (tense ambient music)      

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:44.198
        - He better be.         

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.134
     (tense ambient music)      

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:41.989
     (pounding on the door)     

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.392
 - [Jimmy] Here's her address.  

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:46.260
       Promise me you'll        
       give it to her.          

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:48.863
           - Jesus.             
         - Promise me!          

01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:50.865
       - Jesus, I promise       
       man, I promise!          

01:17:50.867 --> 01:17:53.300
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:21.429
   - I don't have much time.    

01:18:23.066 --> 01:18:24.398
     - Yo Jimmy, wait man!      

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:28.469
     I got something I got      
     to say before you go.      

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.406
     After my mother died,      

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:37.778
   my father and I were never   
   really the same, you know?   

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:44.218
     And I know that he saw     
     you as more of a son       

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.953
      than he ever saw me.      

01:18:46.723 --> 01:18:48.122
       And that was hard.       

01:18:51.794 --> 01:18:54.395
   I never got to say           
   goodbye to my father, man.   

01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:00.935
    And I know you did right    
    by him when he was sick.    

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:06.407
    And I never got a chance    
    to thank you for that.      

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:11.412
  So in case for some reason,   

01:19:13.015 --> 01:19:14.882
  I don't ever see you again,   

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:18.119
        I love you man.         

01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:21.021
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:34.435
      You sure you're           
      going to be alright?      

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:36.537
           You sure?            

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:37.872
        - Yea, I'm sure.        

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:41.008
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:20:02.198 --> 01:20:04.865
           (sobbing)            

01:20:07.069 --> 01:20:08.235
           (gunshot)            

01:20:09.338 --> 01:20:11.539
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:15.509
 - [Lorenzo] Take care of this. 

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:19.914
    (ominous ambient music)     

01:20:20.383 --> 01:20:24.451
           (panting)            

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:27.388
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:33.828
    - [Tommy] It's alright.     

01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:36.363
          You alright?          

01:20:36.365 --> 01:20:38.999
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:20:55.852 --> 01:20:57.451
     You did good, come on.     

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:00.120
            Come on!            

01:21:00.122 --> 01:21:01.856
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:21:01.858 --> 01:21:03.290
     Come on, walk it off.      

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:05.392
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:21:05.394 --> 01:21:06.293
              Woo.              

01:21:06.295 --> 01:21:07.428
        (Jimmy coughing)        

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:08.495
            Alright.            

01:21:08.497 --> 01:21:10.998
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:19.006
        (Tommy humming)         

01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:23.577
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:49.637
     (dramatic piano music)     

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:00.681
             Ready?             

01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:03.050
     (dramatic piano music)     

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.692
             (bang)             

01:22:47.396 --> 01:22:48.329
              Hey.              

01:22:54.203 --> 01:22:55.169
          You alright?          

01:22:56.105 --> 01:22:57.304
         You did good.          

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:12.653
        - So that's it?         

01:23:15.191 --> 01:23:16.457
       - Unless she dies        
       Jimmy, and then          

01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:17.758
  I'm going to come find you.   

01:23:19.261 --> 01:23:20.227
          - She won't.          

01:23:20.596 --> 01:23:21.595
             - Yea.             

01:23:23.632 --> 01:23:25.099
        But if she does.        

01:23:25.534 --> 01:23:28.736
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.144
        Oh my goodness.         

01:23:37.146 --> 01:23:38.512
           (chuckles)           

01:23:39.215 --> 01:23:40.381
   You know Jimmy, you and I    

01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:41.382
       actually made a          
       pretty good team.        

01:23:41.384 --> 01:23:43.550
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:47.721
   - Can I ask you something?   

01:23:48.124 --> 01:23:49.189
        - [Tommy] Sure.         

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:52.059
        - Why'd you want        
        to work with me?        

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:54.361
          - I didn't.           

01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:59.133
 Jimmy, I did this for Sierra.  

01:23:59.135 --> 01:24:01.602
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:24:02.605 --> 01:24:03.704
    - Lorenzo's little girl?    

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:06.106
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:24:08.511 --> 01:24:11.512
    - Yea, Lorenzo's her        
    father,you know, but...     

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:16.450
     She's my little girl.      

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:20.320
            - I see.            

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:24.558
  - He wasn't lying, you know?  

01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:25.759
He would have killed you Jimmy, 

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:27.094
   he would have killed you.    

01:24:27.096 --> 01:24:28.695
    He wouldn't have            
    thought twice about it.     

01:24:28.697 --> 01:24:30.564
           You know?            

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:32.432
   But then we would have       
   lost the package and I...    

01:24:32.435 --> 01:24:34.234
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:24:35.438 --> 01:24:36.804
          I just, I...          

01:24:37.139 --> 01:24:38.405
     I couldn't have that.      

01:24:40.276 --> 01:24:41.608
    And I'm sure he gave        
    you a great performance     

01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:43.710
   when he was                  
   interrogating you, but...    

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:48.549
       Truth is, he is a        
       horrible father.         

01:24:51.754 --> 01:24:52.853
       - So you love her?       

01:24:52.855 --> 01:24:54.822
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:07.367
  - Can't have kids of my own.  

01:25:11.674 --> 01:25:12.840
        And it's not her        
        fault, you know?        

01:25:12.842 --> 01:25:14.308
    It's not her fault that     

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:17.144
    her father's a gangster,    
    and mom was a whore.        

01:25:19.815 --> 01:25:21.515
   And she can say, you know?   

01:25:24.186 --> 01:25:25.519
      It's not her fault.       

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:31.759
      I don't know Jimmy.       

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.659
     There's no playbook        
     for this type of shit.     

01:25:32.661 --> 01:25:35.729
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:39.766
I didn't like letting you walk, 

01:25:40.769 --> 01:25:43.303
   after what you did to Lou.   

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:49.209
      Like I said,              
      there's no playbook.      

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:52.513
      All I know is that,       

01:25:52.515 --> 01:25:54.448
  in this line of work, you...  

01:25:54.450 --> 01:25:55.849
    You make the guy that's     
    got the thing you want,     

01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:57.417
     you make him an ally.      

01:25:58.721 --> 01:25:59.887
         Not an enemy.          

01:26:02.725 --> 01:26:03.757
    That's how I played it.     

01:26:03.759 --> 01:26:06.860
  (dramatic orchestral music)   

01:26:09.765 --> 01:26:10.814
 - Well I hope you know that I  

01:26:10.815 --> 01:26:11.864
     never would have taken     
     this job if I had          

01:26:11.867 --> 01:26:13.901
known what the package was for. 

01:26:17.473 --> 01:26:18.839
     - Doesn't matter now.      

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:22.876
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:26:27.816 --> 01:26:28.782
             Here.              

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:31.952
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:26:37.826 --> 01:26:40.360
     - Time to cash in          
     that insurance policy?     

01:26:42.932 --> 01:26:44.398
             - Yea.             

01:26:46.769 --> 01:26:48.569
       I want you to call       
       me when it's done.       

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:50.871
             Okay?              

01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:54.608
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:26:58.714 --> 01:26:59.846
           Hey Jimmy.           

01:27:03.252 --> 01:27:04.818
      You asked me, but...      

01:27:06.355 --> 01:27:07.821
        Why'd you do it?        

01:27:07.823 --> 01:27:10.724
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:27:12.361 --> 01:27:14.328
  - It was the ultimate boost.  

01:27:14.863 --> 01:27:17.965
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:27:20.636 --> 01:27:22.269
      - You disappear kid.      

01:27:22.504 --> 01:27:24.805
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:27:35.851 --> 01:27:37.651
       (door chimes ring)       

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:40.821
      - Back the fuck up!       

01:27:41.257 --> 01:27:42.489
          Take a seat!          

01:27:42.858 --> 01:27:44.324
       - Jimmy, Jimmy,          
       take it easy man!        

01:27:44.326 --> 01:27:45.425
        - Take it easy?         

01:27:45.995 --> 01:27:47.728
  - Please, have a seat Jimmy.  

01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:49.496
- I'm not sitting anymore today.

01:27:49.498 --> 01:27:51.365
     I don't want to talk,      
     I just want my money.      

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:52.899
          Pick it up!           

01:27:53.969 --> 01:27:55.335
          Open it up!           

01:27:59.475 --> 01:28:00.540
            Shut it!            

01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:02.843
           - Please.            

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:04.711
      Now, come on, Jimmy.      

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:05.879
      - [Jimmy] Fuck you.       

01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:09.016
         - Do you mind?         

01:28:09.885 --> 01:28:11.285
         - Do it slow!          

01:28:14.857 --> 01:28:16.023
    - You know I lied Jimmy.    

01:28:18.727 --> 01:28:20.060
           - No shit!           

01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:21.595
      - About the tequila.      

01:28:22.698 --> 01:28:23.864
       It's really cheap.       

01:28:23.866 --> 01:28:25.499
 - All tastes like shit to me.  

01:28:26.035 --> 01:28:28.435
- Okay, one last request, amigo.

01:28:31.507 --> 01:28:32.873
  How did we end up this way?   

01:28:34.843 --> 01:28:36.643
     - I guess I got lucky.     

01:28:37.513 --> 01:28:38.912
   - I don't believe in luck.   

01:28:39.581 --> 01:28:41.014
  - You could use some by now.  

01:28:42.084 --> 01:28:43.550
      - Hey you don't           
      have to do this man,      

01:28:43.552 --> 01:28:44.785
      you got your money.       

01:28:44.787 --> 01:28:46.953
      - And you almost got      
      me killed, twice!         

01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:49.723
   - Hey, it wasn't personal!   

01:28:49.725 --> 01:28:50.724
         - How's that?          

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:52.092
           - Lorenzo.           

01:28:52.594 --> 01:28:54.361
   Killed my cousin Graciela.   

01:28:54.863 --> 01:28:57.331
      This was my first         
      chance to get even.       

01:28:57.866 --> 01:28:59.900
       - Why me, why the        
       bullshit story?          

01:29:01.904 --> 01:29:03.370
- I wanted to get rid of Austin.

01:29:04.773 --> 01:29:06.940
      I figured Lorenzo's       
      guys would kill him.      

01:29:07.376 --> 01:29:09.810
     And I was hoping you'd     
     get away, and you did!     

01:29:09.812 --> 01:29:11.011
   - You're a terrible liar.    

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:12.846
   But it doesn't matter now.   

01:29:13.349 --> 01:29:15.048
I'm not killing you for Lorenzo.

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:17.384
  He already thinks I'm dead.   

01:29:18.487 --> 01:29:19.953
   - So Tommy gets his wish.    

01:29:20.656 --> 01:29:22.356
  At the hands of a dead man.   

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:24.591
    - These things play out.    

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.793
 - That's why I like you Jimmy. 

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:29.096
     'Cause you're smarter      
     than the average bear.     

01:29:30.032 --> 01:29:31.898
      But let me give you       
      a word of advice.         

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:33.066
        For the future.         

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:36.970
      You wear your heart       
      on you sleeve.            

01:29:38.907 --> 01:29:40.440
    And that makes you weak.    

01:29:43.912 --> 01:29:46.046
        - So my life was        
        worth 500 grand?        

01:29:46.982 --> 01:29:49.116
     And now I'm buying it      
     back for a lot more.       

01:29:50.686 --> 01:29:53.053
   - You would have done the    
   same thing in my position.   

01:29:54.056 --> 01:29:55.021
         - Hard to say.         

01:29:56.992 --> 01:29:58.125
         - Salut Jimmy.         

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:00.093
          - Salut Roy.          

01:30:01.029 --> 01:30:02.429
           (gunshot)            

01:30:03.899 --> 01:30:06.633
           (humming)            

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:10.003
      (cell phone buzzing)      

01:30:13.409 --> 01:30:14.508
            - Hello?            

01:30:15.077 --> 01:30:16.576
          - It's done.          

01:30:17.946 --> 01:30:20.414
     - No, sorry, you got       
     the wrong number, bud.     

01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:22.716
    (dramatic ambient music)    

01:30:52.181 --> 01:30:56.049
     (dramatic bass music)      

01:32:04.052 --> 01:32:07.754
     (dramatic bass music)      

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:37.083
       (upbeat rap music)
