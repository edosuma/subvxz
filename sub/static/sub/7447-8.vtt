WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.843
I thought I told you to get out of here.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.241
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.
Go ahead and try!

00:07.000 --> 00:09.128
Looks like you'll be taking a little holiday.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.523
What does that mean?
There's no work for you here, my girl.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.921
Name's Greg.
I know who you are.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.969
You work for Kate Leigh, don't you?

00:17.120 --> 00:19.248
I was thinking about starting
a new career.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.721
Tim, that's Frank Green,
the 'Little Gunman'.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.331
You're a class act.

00:27.480 --> 00:30.051
I'm better than that bitch will ever be.
Too right.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.965
Can only be one queen.
No doubt about it.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.724
Just wait outside.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.769
Your Highness.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.087
My beautiful boy.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.600 --> 01:36.524
Here we go, fat Sydney rookies.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.808
Doesn't get any fresher than this.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.689
Thanks.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.127
I read a story in the 'Truth' the other day.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.850
Bullshit, Barney, you can't even read.

01:47.360 --> 01:50.489
Now, they asked Benny Wearing
what he wanted to be doing in five years.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.166
You know what he said?
Still scoring goals for the Rabbitohs.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.800
How good is that, eh?
Yeah.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.803
What do you want to be doing
in five years?

01:57.960 --> 01:59.291
Me?
Yeah.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.647
No idea.

02:01.800 --> 02:06.044
Greg?
Prime minister, mate, no doubt about it.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.362
Come on.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.410
Um, seriously, I don't know.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.801
Maybe, um... maybe have a family.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.362
Couple of kids.
Bullshit!

02:17.520 --> 02:20.171
Aggie?
Stranger things have happened.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.527
Yeah, not many.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.604
How about you, Wal?

02:25.760 --> 02:29.890
Just like Benny Wearing, mate -
still scoring tries for Kate Leigh.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.367
I'm gonna go for a swim.
Who's up for it?

02:40.520 --> 02:43.126
The water's freezing.
Your balls will pop out your mouth.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.807
Oh, you big girl. Bruce?
Yeah, righto, I'm up for it.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.486
Ah, stuff it.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.802
I'll take care of your gear.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.804
No, come on, Wal. One in, all in.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.008
No, he's a bushie, mate. Can't swim.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.525
Bullshit!

02:58.680 --> 03:00.728
I have never meta bloke
who can't swim.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.601
Last one in's a poofter!

03:20.680 --> 03:22.569
Before this week was out,

03:22.720 --> 03:25.724
one man would be dead,
another wounded

03:25.880 --> 03:28.963
and a third would be facing
the hangman's noose,

03:29.120 --> 03:31.805
all for the love of a woman.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.566
Alright, careful.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.848
At least the dunny works.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.049
Isn't it beautiful, eh?

03:41.200 --> 03:43.043
Could never have that at Palmer Street.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.407
You don't even play it.
Well, so fucking what?

03:45.560 --> 03:49.451
Anyone who's got any class
has got their own fucking piano.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.443
Yoo-hoo! Neighbours!

03:51.600 --> 03:53.045
Oh!

03:53.200 --> 03:55.202
Welcome to Torrington Road.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.728
I'm Gladys Solomon.
This is my daughter, Constance.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.770
Say hello, Constance.
Hello.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.729
And here's a little something.

04:03.880 --> 04:08.807
Oh, thank you, ducks. How very kind!

04:08.960 --> 04:12.760
Well, I'm Matilda
and this is my husband, James.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.570
Mmm

04:14.720 --> 04:19.123
Oh, my, what a lovely pianoforte!

04:19.279 --> 04:20.725
Thank you, Gladys.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.690
Constance goes to
the Conservatorium of Music.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.171
She's very gifted.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.891
Yeah, I can see she's well endowed...
with talent.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.849
Sticks out a mile.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.844
You'll have to come over
and play for us sometime, Connie,

04:33.000 --> 04:34.331
once we're settled in.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.689
Oh, that'd be lovely,
wouldn't it, Constance?

04:37.840 --> 04:40.605
Oh. Bless.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.571
You like to dance?

04:57.360 --> 05:00.603
Um... yes. Sorry.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.683
It's alright, sweets.

05:02.840 --> 05:06.481
One cup of sugar. Here you go.
Ta.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.764
Are you alright?
Oh, yeah. it'll pass.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.888
Better.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.247
Oh, don't worry, I'm not sick.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.244
I'm just a little bit pregnant.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.448
Oh.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.363
Feels good to say it out loud.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.611
What a pair of prize fillies.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.330
What's cooking, good-looking?

05:33.480 --> 05:36.450
Horses run around Randwick
in the dark, now, do they?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.001
Who wants a drink?
Connie was just leaving.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.242
Oh, that's a shame.
Thought we could have a party.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.404
Goodnight, Mr Devine,
and congratulations.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.086
Oh, thanks, love.

05:47.240 --> 05:51.131
Get 5 quid a night for a girl like that.
Why the congratulations?

05:51.280 --> 05:54.363
Having a win on the ponies.
You did, didn't you?

05:55.360 --> 05:57.601
Let's have that drink
you were talking about.

06:01.280 --> 06:05.365
Next time bring me an extra blanket.
It's getting chilly at night.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.362
What have you found out about
my future son-in-law?

06:09.520 --> 06:11.522
He spends most of his days with Eileen.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.648
They go to the pictures, go for walks.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.565
You know, things that young couples do.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.246
I won't have them fornicating
underneath my roof.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.289
You tell her that,
tell her you'll break her legs.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.442
Yeah, no worries.
I've already taken care of that.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.126
Good.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.004
You can send Bruce in.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.731
Um, how's the jumper going?

06:40.880 --> 06:44.043
Oh, yeah, it's coming along good.
I like the colour.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.248
You reckon it'll suit him?

06:47.760 --> 06:50.969
Yeah. I'll go get him.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.570
Don't take too long.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.610
Morning, sleepyhead.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.091
Come back to bed.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.481
I'd love to, but I can't. Got to go to work.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.404
Making the world
a more dangerous place?

07:27.560 --> 07:29.164
Yeah, something like that.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.083
I'll see you this arvo.
See ya.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.569
In Greg Gaffney,
Aggie found the love of her life.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.724
Perhaps branding Nellie Cameron
with a razor

08:17.880 --> 08:20.326
was her way of declaring it.

08:20.480 --> 08:24.929
Whatever her reasons,
it was only ever going to end badly.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.605
Not so tough now, are you, bitch?

08:26.760 --> 08:28.125
Please, Aggie!
âPlease, Aggieâ what?

08:28.280 --> 08:31.124
I'm gonna cut you so badly.
Don't, Aggie!

08:31.280 --> 08:33.044
Let's start with your nose.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.530
No!

08:34.679 --> 08:35.681
Let's.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.047
Try that again and I will kill you!

08:53.040 --> 08:55.441
Blue Bags are gonna thrash
the Dirty Reds.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.523
Yeah.
You going to the game?

08:57.680 --> 08:59.444
No, mate, no.
Greg, Greg!

08:59.600 --> 09:01.364
Aggie needs you. She's been bashed.
Where?

09:01.520 --> 09:03.010
Your place!

09:05.280 --> 09:06.805
What happened?

09:08.680 --> 09:10.967
Aggie, what happened?
Don't look at me.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.084
Who did this?
Frank Green.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.527
What, because you left the Devines?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.684
I should have been there
to look after you.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.604
Oh, it's not your fault.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.001
Look at me.
No, I can't.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.969
I'm hideous.
No, you're not, you're beautiful.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.248
No.
Look at me.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.490
You listen to me.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.723
You listen. You are still beautiful.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.042
No.
No, you are.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.487
You always will be.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.529
Always.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.284
What are you doing?

10:04.920 --> 10:06.729
I'm gonna kill the coot.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.490
Greg.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.165
Be careful.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.889
Don't worry about me.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.169
Get a car, meet me outside.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.288
Yeah, but I...
Just do it.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.531
What's going on?

10:47.680 --> 10:49.603
I'm gonna kill Frank Green.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.001
You're gonna what?
I'm serious.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.128
You should see what he did to Aggie.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.645
Is she alright?
No.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.121
No, she's not alright.
She's hurt, she's humiliated.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.770
So, you with me or what?

11:01.520 --> 11:02.851
No, mate, I'm not.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.048
Look, I'm sorry that she's hurt,

11:05.200 --> 11:08.010
but you should go home
and look after her,

11:08.160 --> 11:10.970
'cause no-one's killing anyone.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.804
You're weak as piss, Wal.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.521
If it wasn't for Aggie, Tilly Devine
would own this bloody place.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.490
Where to?

11:32.280 --> 11:33.770
Just drive.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.722
Nah, mate, I prefer
a good piece of lumber.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.043
You don't do two years in the Bay
for carrying a piece of timber.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.043
And I'm not one for razors, not after...

11:45.200 --> 11:46.531
Just take it.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.250
Mate.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.569
Now bloody well get this crate moving.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.009
He could be
bloody anywhere.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.288
We keep driving till we find him.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.968
Burn in hell, Green!

12:32.120 --> 12:34.282
screaming

12:34.440 --> 12:36.442
Shit, it's jammed!
Barney, where's your gun?

12:36.600 --> 12:37.965
The bloody thing's jammed! Barney!

12:38.120 --> 12:39.929
The car!
Let's go, go!

12:40.080 --> 12:41.923
Go!

12:42.080 --> 12:43.411
Drive!

13:07.040 --> 13:10.044
To shoot him was bad enough,
but to shoot him and not kill him...

13:10.200 --> 13:12.282
That's why we've got to finish it.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.681
You just started a bloody war!

13:14.840 --> 13:17.127
Their guard will be up,
so we've gotta act fast.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.806
We can hit him hard again
when he comes out of St Vincent's.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.566
Shit.
This ends when Greg is dead.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.609
Alright.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.444
Hard and fast.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.045
Barney?
Yeah, I'm in.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.850
That's good, mate. Go start the car.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.245
Alright. Let's do this.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.722
Pray to God none of us swing for it.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.002
What's wrong?
Don't know.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.969
ow! Shit!

13:50.120 --> 13:51.451
Do you know
what you're doing, Barney?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.170
Yeah, just keep your shirt on.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.651
Quicker to hoof it.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.724
If we do this, we need to be able
to get away in a hurry.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.450
What about the boss's car?

13:59.600 --> 14:02.490
We're not taking Kate Leigh's car
to a shooting. Use your bonce!

14:02.640 --> 14:05.007
Car trouble, Barney?
Yeah. Bloody thing!

14:05.160 --> 14:08.084
You know these buggers run better
if you put petrol in them.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.087
Barney, are we out of petrol?

14:12.240 --> 14:13.810
Yeah, could be.
Barney!

14:13.960 --> 14:15.530
Yeah, it's not my fault.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.047
You boys heard?
Someone shot Frankie Green.

14:18.200 --> 14:21.841
Yeah, yeah, we heard.
Do you know if he's still at St Vincent's?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.002
Nah. Didn't want to hang around
for the coppers.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.243
He's heading out to Maroubra. Reckons
he'll be right with Big Jim Devine.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.051
Does he? Well, I shot the bastard.
Greg.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.807
And I'm gonna finish him and Devine off
tonight, so fuck the lot of them!

14:33.960 --> 14:35.450
Greg!

14:38.960 --> 14:41.850
Hello, operator? Put me through
to Big Jim Devine in Maroubra.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.411
Make it snappy!

14:43.560 --> 14:47.121
It's John Prendergast, Mr Devine.
Here, this'll help.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.841
Righto.
No, I won't forget you. Cheers.

14:53.280 --> 14:56.682
What's up? Who was that?
Jim, who was that?

14:58.880 --> 15:01.565
Some punk reckons Gaffney
and his mates are on their way here.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.326
He's bragging he's gonna
do both of us tonight.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.970
Sweet mercy.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.929
Let 'em come.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.924
Where to, gents?

15:11.080 --> 15:13.003
You know where the Devines live
in Maroubra?

15:13.160 --> 15:16.004
Uh, Torrington Road?
Yeah.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.605
That's where we're headed.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.489
Tilly's having one of her big shivoos,
is she?

15:19.640 --> 15:21.847
Yeah, something like that.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.562
Come on, Frank.
Quick game's a good game.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.011
Sugar.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.970
Oh, look who just got the old maid!

15:36.120 --> 15:38.441
Can't we play poker?
No!

15:38.600 --> 15:40.011
I like old maid.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.491
Nugget, it was your turn.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.007
Gots to love yourself
a pair of black queens.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.525
On!

15:45.680 --> 15:47.250
Shh.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.731
Sounds like a car.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.370
Pull over here.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.848
But the Devine place is a couple along.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.331
Here will do.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.686
Greg.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.491
It steadies my hand.
Alright, gents.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.530
That'll be six bob on the knocker.
Just wait here.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.603
We'll fix you up
when we get back in town.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.205
No, six bob, or I'm leaving right now.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.691
Fred!
I mean it.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.161
Oh, alright.

16:11.320 --> 16:15.086
Two bob, three, three and six,
four and six threepence. That's all I got.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.402
Switch the lights off.
This might be them now.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.210
Mate.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.610
I got a really bad feeling about this.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.649
You're gutless, Wal.
Mate!

16:26.800 --> 16:29.326
Kate won't he happy.
Fuck Kate! This is personal.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.847
I want Frank Green's blood!

16:32.000 --> 16:34.970
We'll fix you up, promise.
Famous last words.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.122
Give me Frank Green
and no-one else gets hurt!

16:37.280 --> 16:38.691
Reckon that's them.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.569
Whole bloody street
knows it's them.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.245
I'm with you, Jim.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.890
You stay here, soldier. You're wounded.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.371
That...
I'll handle this.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.851
That's Gaffney.
I said I'll handle it!

16:47.000 --> 16:48.331
It's my fight!

16:48.480 --> 16:50.642
I want Frank Green!

16:50.800 --> 16:53.963
Alright, you bastards,
I'm coming in!

16:55.440 --> 16:57.807
I want Frank Green's blood!

16:57.960 --> 16:59.883
Don't come on my property, or I'll shoot!

17:00.040 --> 17:01.724
Shoot. I got plenty of mates with me!

17:01.880 --> 17:03.211
I'm telephoning the police.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.849
I warned you!

17:13.079 --> 17:14.286
Jim!

17:14.440 --> 17:16.089
Bugger this for a joke.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.281
Get him, Barney, get him!

17:21.480 --> 17:23.528
Come on, then, you bastards!

17:23.680 --> 17:25.842
Get out of here!
We're not gonna leave you!

17:26.000 --> 17:27.525
I'm done for. Go!

17:32.520 --> 17:34.010
Argh!

17:38.920 --> 17:40.285
Nugget, come with us!

17:40.440 --> 17:42.761
Jim, no! Don't go.
They might be bluffing.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.207
You don't bluff after getting hit
by a round from a.303.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.725
Come on, Nugget.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.842
G'day, boys.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.650
I'd kill for a drink.
Till, get the brandy!

18:15.160 --> 18:16.685
Get it down.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.290
Thanks.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.371
I'll be Solid.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.602
Good man.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.047
I'm the Gunman.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.170
Yeah, mate, you are.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.405
Oh, Jesus.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.847
Tell Aggie I love her.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.731
Police!
Christ, Wal.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.690
What are we gonna do?
Nothing we can do.

18:54.040 --> 18:57.044
I was protecting my wife and property!
It was self-defense!

18:57.200 --> 18:59.487
Don't a man got a right
to protect his own home?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.722
You gonna let that bastard
get away with this?

19:07.040 --> 19:09.281
Greg Gaffney, true to his word,

19:09.440 --> 19:14.321
refused to tell the police his name
or who gunned him down.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.129
Eternal rest grant unto him,
O Lord,

19:18.280 --> 19:20.328
and let perpetual light shine upon him.

19:20.480 --> 19:24.007
May his soul and the souls of the faithful
departed rest in peace. Amen.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.650
Amen.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.807
Did he get the last rites?

19:39.960 --> 19:42.645
A chance to make his peace with God?

19:42.800 --> 19:44.290
I don't know.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.642
So what the fuck happened?

20:59.960 --> 21:02.486
I let him down.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.688
The Lord has chosen
to call our brother Gregory

21:17.840 --> 21:21.162
from this life to Himself.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.961
We therefore commit his body
to the earth,

21:25.120 --> 21:28.966
for we are dust,
and unto dust we shall return.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.562
But the Lord Jesus Christ...

21:32.720 --> 21:35.564
What are those mongrels
doing here, Wal?

21:35.720 --> 21:36.767
Don't know.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.003
They got no right.

22:05.960 --> 22:09.885
...the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.088
Amen.

22:17.520 --> 22:21.411
Thanks be to God.
Thanks be to God.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.004
You're gonna hang for this,
you murdering bastard.

22:48.160 --> 22:52.688
My only regret, Tomlinson,
is that you're not in that box too.

22:52.840 --> 22:56.640
Jim, we're here to pay our respects.
Not now.

23:04.040 --> 23:07.044
Terribly sorry about the death
of your son, Mrs Gaffney.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.409
I pray for him every night.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.041
Lovely.

23:17.760 --> 23:18.602
Come on.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.330
The inquest that followed
wasn't convinced

23:20.480 --> 23:24.326
by Big Jim Devine's claims of contrition
and self-defense either

23:24.480 --> 23:26.721
He was to stand trial for murder.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.765
He shoots a man in cold blood
and they grant him bail?

23:36.920 --> 23:38.968
Well, at least it's 400 quid.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.600
I don't care if it's ă4,000.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.489
Fuck

23:45.840 --> 23:47.683
How's Greg's mum bearing up?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.729
Not too good.

23:49.880 --> 23:52.247
Parents are never meant
to bury their children.

23:53.680 --> 23:57.321
Send her a bunch of flowers
and a case of brandy.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.130
Righto.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.489
What else?

24:03.640 --> 24:07.690
Eileen's band's been heard in church
for the third time.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.207
They set a date?
Don't know.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.371
You tell that sneaky little cow
to come visit me,

24:15.520 --> 24:17.363
or I'll cut her off without a farthing.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.329
You tell her she'll get nothing.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.247
Best be on your way. See you next time.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.809
My arm's on the mend,
just in case you're wondering.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.643
What's the word on the street?

24:38.800 --> 24:40.450
Leigh's people tried anything yet?

24:40.600 --> 24:42.409
Not yet.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.050
But they will.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.840
They're not gonna take
losing one of their own lying down.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.650
An eye for an eye.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.403
Unless we...

24:57.320 --> 24:58.810
Come on, we're going into town.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.201
Got a haemorrhoid
the size of a baby's head.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.203
Gotta ease it out gently.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.249
My hubby, the poet.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.765
Come on.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.251
What's the rush?

25:09.400 --> 25:12.244
We're gonna show the world
we still rule the roost.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.290
We're gonna crush them
on their home turf.

25:15.440 --> 25:16.965
I'll get Frank.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.410
Hey.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.481
Thanks, mister.
Want us to whistle you a tune?

26:10.640 --> 26:13.689
I'm a really grouse Whistler.
No.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.650
No, thank you. Very nice, though.
Maybe some other time.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.205
Don't be cross.
You know I'm a big softie.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.605
Your mum wants to see you.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.240
I don't like going out to that place.
It gives me the creeps.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.890
She could be getting out soon.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.371
Another couple of months.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.204
Looks like she'll get out early
for good behaviour.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.691
Her? That'll be a first.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.729
So if you don't want
all hell to break loose...

26:34.880 --> 26:36.325
Wal! We're in for a stoush

26:36.480 --> 26:38.130
Frank Green's recruiting muscle
for the Devines.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.170
They're heading to Kellett Street
packing shooters and blades.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.690
Get Will Archer, Octopus, Barney,
anyone you can find. Just go, go!

26:46.840 --> 26:48.410
They all up for some rough stuff?

26:48.560 --> 26:52.087
This lot would slit their mothers'
own throats for free grog and snow.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.969
Excellent.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.084
Tomlinson, I reckon the action's
gonna be out here tonight.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.891
Reckon you're gonna
freeze your arses off.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.929
Bring it on, mate.

27:05.080 --> 27:08.562
I could take you and your mates
with one hand tied behind my back.

27:08.720 --> 27:11.246
Who's that one, with the big mouth?

27:11.400 --> 27:13.084
Snowy Prendergast.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.971
He's the one who phoned through
the tip-off about Gaffney.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.327
Reckons we owe him.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.005
Punk.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.481
Want to go eat, love?
No.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.802
I want to stay and watch.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.763
I got half a dozen blokes
coming from the Arms after the swill.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.649
They got their own blades?
Yeah.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.280
Give 'em a tot of rum with a twist
when they get here.

27:42.440 --> 27:45.205
Whatever it takes to show those pricks
out there we mean business.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.966
Telford reckons the big fella
will be good for the Cup.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.371
Phar Lap.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.365
I'm pregnant.
What?

28:02.520 --> 28:05.205
We're gonna have a baby.
Jesus Christ!

28:05.360 --> 28:07.408
I think that name's already been taken.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.242
Tomlinson and his crew are coming out.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.925
Old Stiff y and Mo.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.526
You want us to take them on?
No. Wait for my word.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.444
For the change of shift at the cop shop.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.204
Don't want the 'Blizzard'
spoiling your fun.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.840
Alright.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.770
How?

28:26.200 --> 28:28.407
You're not really asking me how.

28:28.560 --> 28:32.360
It's why you bought the house.
One of the reasons, yeah.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.444
Brothel's no place to raise a bubba.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.971
Are you happy or what?

28:38.120 --> 28:41.647
Yeah, yeah, course I am.
It's a bit of a shock, that's all.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.848
Hope I'm around to see the little tacker.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.570
You planning on pissing off?

28:45.720 --> 28:47.848
Well, Till, I could swing for murder.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.849
You're not gonna swing.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.607
I won't let them touch a hair
on your head.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.288
Ready?
Hey!

29:00.440 --> 29:02.329
Ladies.

29:02.480 --> 29:03.970
I'm gonna smash your face in.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.485
I say, you fellows,
will you kindly desist

29:14.640 --> 29:16.369
from making a disturbance
and clear off?

29:18.920 --> 29:20.684
Shut up!

29:22.800 --> 29:26.407
Why don't you go back to the States,
you fool!

29:27.480 --> 29:28.970
Bastards!

30:14.760 --> 30:16.683
That looks about even steven.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.605
Frank!

30:46.760 --> 30:48.250
Frank, come here!

30:53.200 --> 30:54.690
The boyfriend.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.771
Give him a new smile.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.763
My pleasure.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.130
Come on!

31:12.840 --> 31:14.330
Hold him!

31:58.400 --> 32:00.323
What happened?

32:03.960 --> 32:06.008
I didn't see who did it.

32:07.560 --> 32:10.006
That's all.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.730
Now piss off.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.121
How old is Higgs?
22.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.805
He's a good-looking young bloke.

32:19.960 --> 32:24.249
Gets turned into Frankenstein's monster
and he still won't say who slashed him.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.244
Doctor stitched up another dozen
monkeys from the same stoush.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.050
None of them had anything to say.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.884
Damn the lot of them.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.890
Someone went round to his digs.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.209
All his stuff's gone.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.847
He's got two brothers.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.367
Bill and Bert.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.966
Bruce, Bill and Bert.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.331
He's probably with one of them.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.289
Yeah, maybe.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.088
He'll be back.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.170
Yeah

33:41.720 --> 33:43.051
Yeah, thanks, Wal.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.089
You can go now.

33:58.440 --> 34:00.283
He left you this.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.242
Dearest love,

34:21.400 --> 34:23.880
By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.929
Please forgive me
for not having the courage

34:26.080 --> 34:28.286
to say goodbye to your beautiful face.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.569
I'm not strong enough to bear
the look of horror and revulsion

34:31.719 --> 34:34.849
you would be unable to hide upon seeing
the hideous thing I have become.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.969
I learned so much from you, my love.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.088
Thank you.

34:40.239 --> 34:44.370
Yours faithfully, Bruce Higgs.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.641
Bruce Higgs
never returned to Razorhurst.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.485
Kate Leigh never saw him again.

34:52.639 --> 34:55.803
But she never forgot her beautiful boy.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.165
After a very short trial,

35:00.320 --> 35:04.484
Big Jim Devine was acquitted of the
murder of Greg Gaffney, on all counts.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.971
Here's to justice being done.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.566
And done like a bloody dinner!

35:11.200 --> 35:16.161
And here's to Greg Gaffney,
rotting in hell where he belongs.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.641
We're gonna party till we drop!

35:31.000 --> 35:33.367
Bill, Premier's on the phone.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.284
Tell him I'm drunk.

35:37.440 --> 35:41.490
You don't look it.
Give me half an hour.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.891
Listen.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.610
Put him through.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.044
You are never, ever
going over there again.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.850
Fuck! Tilly!

37:50.000 --> 37:51.650
Tiny!

37:51.800 --> 37:53.290
Jesus!

37:59.880 --> 38:01.405
You're in hospital.

38:01.560 --> 38:04.689
Gave us all a real fright.

38:04.840 --> 38:06.490
The baby?

38:06.640 --> 38:08.483
You lost the baby.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.125
We almost lost you.

38:14.280 --> 38:15.805
We'll wait outside.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.530
Ta.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.364
Hey.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.887
Who's the toughest gal
in Sydney town, eh?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.809
Not here.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.168
I wanted that baby so much.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.926
I know you did. I know you did, baby.

38:42.840 --> 38:46.242
But did they say that we could try again?

38:46.400 --> 38:48.402
They didn't say.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.008
Those girls who just left,

38:53.160 --> 38:55.003
they're your babies.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.731
They need you as much
as they need any mum.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.201
That's what you're best at.

39:01.280 --> 39:04.011
The best damn madam
this town's ever seen.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.083
That'll do me.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.961
What day is it?

39:11.120 --> 39:12.929
It's Saturday, love.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.567
Well, you'd better get a move on.
You'll miss the races.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.688
Don't be silly.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.006
Besides, I don't have the tips
on the third.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.088
I'll get you a cup of tea.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.241
Amen.
Amen.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.971
Dear friends in Christ,

39:55.120 --> 39:59.648
you are about to enter into a union
that is most sacred.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.483
Where to?

40:05.640 --> 40:07.005
You know where.

40:07.160 --> 40:12.121
Albert Reginald Duke, wilt thou take
Eileen Leigh, here present,

40:12.280 --> 40:15.966
for thy lawful wife according to the rite
of Holy Mother the Church?

40:18.720 --> 40:23.851
Eileen Leigh, wilt thou take
Albert Reginald Duke, here present,

40:24.000 --> 40:25.490
for thy lawful husband?

40:27.160 --> 40:29.208
I, Albert Reginald Duke...

40:29.360 --> 40:30.725
I, Eileen Leigh...

40:30.880 --> 40:33.121
...take you...
... Albert Reginald Duke.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.611
...for my lawful wife...

40:34.760 --> 40:37.047
Does this thing go any faster?

40:37.200 --> 40:39.441
...to have and to hold...
... from this day forward...

40:39.600 --> 40:41.329
...for better...
... for worse...

40:41.480 --> 40:44.689
...for richer, for poorer...
... in sickness and in health...

40:46.400 --> 40:50.610
...until death do us part.

40:50.760 --> 40:52.524
Amen.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.170
Amen.

41:00.480 --> 41:03.131
You're too late, lady. Wedding's over.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.731
Come on, Katie.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.724
You couldn't have stopped it anyway.
She's legal age.

41:16.120 --> 41:18.487
You got the wrong end of the stick, Wal.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.450
I just wanted to be
at my daughter's wedding.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.284
I'm her mum.
