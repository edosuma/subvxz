00:05.996 --> 00:07.382
Good morning, Mr. Forman.

00:07.663 --> 00:08.650
Charlie!

00:08.826 --> 00:11.419
Didn't recognize you without
your schoolgirl skirt.

00:13.661 --> 00:16.114
Why don't you go drink another
warehouse full of beer?

00:16.149 --> 00:18.791
And then you can get out of
those uncomfortable boy things.

00:21.100 --> 00:21.800
Wow.

00:22.001 --> 00:22.801
He came in here...

00:23.102 --> 00:25.802
Just attact you and
completly ignored me.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.803
You must be the one of (?)

00:29.800 --> 00:30.690
Man,

00:30.691 --> 00:32.864
I really got off on
the wrong foot with your dad.

00:33.134 --> 00:36.175
Ah, it'll blow over. How long
could he stay mad at a kid, right?

00:51.648 --> 00:55.652
You know what? Later on, I'm gonna find
him and apologize. I'm sure he'll understand.

00:55.687 --> 00:58.388
Yeah. Hey, if you're lookin'
for a good conversation starter,

00:58.423 --> 01:00.781
just say we were probably
wrong to go into Vietnam.

01:03.094 --> 01:05.254
Here's your
breakfast, Charlie.

01:06.029 --> 01:07.297
Oh, Eric,

01:07.330 --> 01:10.970
I didn't realize you still lived
here. I thought you left for Africa.

01:11.487 --> 01:13.847
No, I've been sitting here
for, like, ten minutes.

01:13.905 --> 01:17.326
Then you'd better get going, or
you're gonna be late for Africa.

01:18.806 --> 01:21.624
Okay, I get it, mom. You're trying
to make me feel bad about leaving.

01:21.657 --> 01:24.851
Oh, are you still here? I
thought you were in Africa.

01:29.500 --> 01:33.652
So, my mom do the whole pass of
agressive guilt-think about me going to Africa.

01:34.353 --> 01:37.653
Basicly, just consist of her
saying a word "Africa" a lot.

01:39.654 --> 01:40.500
Well...

01:41.501 --> 01:45.201
I believe that if you want how do you feel
is better to use a directive brunch.

01:45.302 --> 01:46.002
Like this....

01:46.403 --> 01:48.303
Don't go to Africa, dillhole!

01:51.104 --> 01:54.304
So, Hyde...
Speaking of a annoying women who hit...

01:54.624 --> 01:56.585
Have you heard
anything from Jackie?

01:56.648 --> 01:58.973
Nope. That's
fine by me, man.

01:59.231 --> 02:01.345
Who does she think she is,
giving me an ultimatum...

02:01.368 --> 02:03.247
"Marry me or I'm
moving to Chicago"?

02:03.270 --> 02:05.431
Then she takes off before
I even give her an answer.

02:05.466 --> 02:08.167
Well, what's the big deal,
man? She let you off the hook.

02:08.191 --> 02:10.774
Yeah. You were gonna
say no anyway, unless...

02:15.294 --> 02:18.107
Oh, my god! You
were gonna say yes!

02:18.145 --> 02:18.849
No.

02:21.785 --> 02:22.419
What?

02:22.570 --> 02:23.368
No.

02:24.754 --> 02:27.184
Oh, my god. You
were gonna marry her.

02:29.086 --> 02:32.010
You were gonna marry
her because you love her.

02:34.084 --> 02:34.776
Hey,

02:35.598 --> 02:36.350
Jackie,

02:36.843 --> 02:39.743
you're everything this poor
little orphan boy ever needed.

02:43.893 --> 02:46.417
- Oh, my god! I really am.
- Oh, my god!

02:48.108 --> 02:48.848
Hey,

02:49.247 --> 02:50.738
I don't love her.

02:51.055 --> 02:54.573
You know what love is? Love is for
losers who are too afraid to be alone.

02:55.031 --> 02:57.062
Uh, no, you're
thinking of kittens.

02:58.354 --> 03:01.489
So I gotta go. I'm gonna go
wrap your going-away present.

03:01.524 --> 03:04.342
Eric, you're the one going away.
You didn't have to get me anything.

03:04.363 --> 03:07.146
Yeah, well, I knew you
were gonna get me something.

03:07.170 --> 03:09.307
I didn't want this to
be awkward again like,

03:09.624 --> 03:10.997
you know, Christmas.

03:12.113 --> 03:14.281
Well, I did get
you something.

03:15.784 --> 03:17.944
Oh, crap, I didn't
get him anything!

03:18.437 --> 03:20.527
He leaves in three days.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.134
Oh, well, why don't you
just get him an ultimatum?

03:25.071 --> 03:27.338
It's free. You don't
have to wrap it.

03:27.362 --> 03:29.205
It'll totally make
him wish he was dead.

03:30.309 --> 03:31.108
Yeah.

03:31.519 --> 03:35.102
Well, it's between that or one of those
shirts that makes him look all muscley.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.611
Look at the blanket I
got for our new apartment.

04:19.814 --> 04:21.416
I found it in a dumpster.

04:22.355 --> 04:25.408
It's got lots of stains,
so it goes with everything.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.194
That is so awesome.

04:29.229 --> 04:32.035
I'm not even gonna ask what
you were doing in the dumpster.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.731
Is Steven here?

04:35.778 --> 04:37.481
No, he went to work.

04:37.551 --> 04:42.013
Oh, but before he left, he was chucking everything
you ever gave him all around the basement.

04:42.185 --> 04:45.496
It was like a hailstorm of
stuffed animals and ABBA records.

04:47.844 --> 04:48.572
Wait,

04:48.854 --> 04:51.496
what are you doing here anyway?
I thought you left for Chicago.

04:51.543 --> 04:54.433
I would have, but my mom
took the car to Tijuana

04:54.456 --> 04:57.450
and won't be back till Cinco
de Mayo, whenever that is.

04:58.448 --> 05:01.353
So until then, I need you guys
to help me avoid the horrors

05:01.388 --> 05:03.995
of seeing Steven till I can figure
out a way to get out of here.

05:04.030 --> 05:07.095
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I think
I hear him coming down the stairs now.

05:07.623 --> 05:09.770
Oh, my god. What do I do?

05:09.794 --> 05:13.105
Okay, um... Quick, get
down under the blanket!

05:17.480 --> 05:21.777
He's not coming down. I made the whole thing
up, and now you're under a stinky blanket!

05:23.151 --> 05:25.312
The stinky blanket burn!

05:25.452 --> 05:27.190
That is awesome!

05:28.071 --> 05:29.936
Oh, that is disgusting.

05:29.959 --> 05:32.073
Oh, this blanket
smells like dog.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.581
That's because when I found it,
it was wrapped around a dead dog.

05:40.351 --> 05:43.803
Uh-oh, Jackie. He's coming
for real this time. Get down!

05:43.838 --> 05:45.083
Oh, my god!

05:46.034 --> 05:48.124
- I got her!
- I got her!

05:52.128 --> 05:54.911
I am gonna kick you
both in the nads.

05:56.086 --> 05:58.423
You're gonna have to do it
later, because here he comes now.

05:58.446 --> 06:00.301
Oh, well, now I
don't believe you.

06:00.336 --> 06:01.499
Okay, then.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.310
Hey, come on in. Good to see you,
Hyde. What's going on, buddy?

06:05.698 --> 06:07.483
She did it again!

06:09.484 --> 06:10.684
I hate you!

06:11.785 --> 06:13.485
Oh, man. We can do this all day.

06:13.686 --> 06:15.486
I've got nowhere to be, man.

06:20.849 --> 06:23.843
I got the best going-away
present for Eric.

06:23.890 --> 06:24.653
Okay...

06:24.841 --> 06:26.555
a pen and pencil set.

06:28.103 --> 06:30.486
That way he can
write me every day.

06:30.827 --> 06:32.927
Well, isn't that just...

06:35.416 --> 06:36.273
Donna,

06:36.802 --> 06:39.737
a going-away gift should
be something special,

06:39.772 --> 06:41.721
meaningful, personal.

06:41.804 --> 06:43.941
Okay, like what...
clock radio?

06:44.563 --> 06:47.660
Underwear? Some
spoons? Help me.

06:48.377 --> 06:50.267
No, honey, like...

06:50.478 --> 06:53.351
Okay. Before Red
went to Korea,

06:53.891 --> 06:58.611
I had my sister take a sexy
boudoir photograph of me.

06:59.568 --> 07:02.457
I was wearing nothing
but a fur coat.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.367
Mrs. Forman, you
bad, bad girl.

07:07.224 --> 07:09.302
It was racy.

07:10.311 --> 07:12.553
You could see my knees.

07:19.154 --> 07:20.000
Hi, Eric.

07:20.501 --> 07:21.600
We need something to drink.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.700
Our throats are all drive from laughting over Jackie
and the stinky blanket.

07:28.501 --> 07:30.200
Jackie and the stinky blanket...

07:31.000 --> 07:34.201
Ow, that sound like a (?) mistery.

07:35.002 --> 07:36.002
I tell you, what the mistery is...

07:36.003 --> 07:38.303
Why (????)

07:39.900 --> 07:42.304
'couse she got glasses.

07:43.305 --> 07:44.305
Mistery solved.

07:45.341 --> 07:48.002
So I gotta go over to
Donna's, get my going-away present.

07:48.025 --> 07:51.407
Man, she is, like, the
world's worst gift giver.

07:52.393 --> 07:57.087
Remember that ugly sweater
vest and that huge man ring?

08:00.868 --> 08:03.251
Now I gotta go get excited
about some other lame thing.

08:03.286 --> 08:06.151
"Oh, wow, Donna, clown
shoes. Thank you so much."

08:07.642 --> 08:10.296
I wish I had a beautiful
girl give me clown shoes.

08:10.883 --> 08:13.712
Hell, I'd settle for a beautiful
clown giving me girl shoes.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.482
I dated a clown once.

08:18.199 --> 08:21.944
But soon as I learned how to make
those balloon animals, I dumped her.

08:26.688 --> 08:29.048
Excuse me, Mr.
Forman... Oh!

08:29.659 --> 08:30.340
Ohh!

08:33.017 --> 08:34.591
What the hell?

08:41.787 --> 08:43.630
Well, that was exciting.

08:48.785 --> 08:53.338
Mr. Forman, I was looking for you to
apologize about the dress thing, okay?

08:53.608 --> 08:57.014
But then I opened
the door, and wow!

08:58.981 --> 09:03.114
No, I don't mean "Wow."
I mean, "Oh, no!"

09:04.605 --> 09:06.390
No, no, I don't
mean, "Oh, no."

09:06.425 --> 09:09.220
Well, what were you doing
just standing there?

09:09.267 --> 09:11.476
I was like a deer caught in the
headlights.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.477
Oh! I said, "headlights."

09:16.313 --> 09:20.094
Red, it was a very
awkward situation.

09:20.141 --> 09:22.198
No one knew what to do.

09:22.233 --> 09:26.308
Well, I know what I would do if I saw
you naked. I'd turn and run the other way.

09:28.309 --> 09:35.309
I mean there is no reason on Earth for
19-year-old boy to be stearing at a woman your age.

09:36.512 --> 09:37.663
Oh, I...

09:38.109 --> 09:41.315
look, damn it, he's the
one in trouble here, not me.

09:43.690 --> 09:47.822
Hey, Kitty, could I have some peanut
oil? I'm gonna fry up some jumbo shrimp,

09:47.870 --> 09:51.323
which is a funny name. It's like
calling someone a giant Midget.

09:53.623 --> 09:55.597
I'd like to see
one of those.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.525
Get this,

09:58.050 --> 10:01.332
Charlie here walked into our
bedroom and saw Kitty naked.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.917
Whoo-hoo! How was that?

10:04.197 --> 10:07.039
Well, how do you think it
was? It was horrifying.

10:08.365 --> 10:09.985
Excuse me.

10:13.672 --> 10:15.762
So, Mr. Forman,

10:15.798 --> 10:18.158
how wrong was it for us
to get into Vietnam, huh?

10:23.789 --> 10:26.583
Uh-oh, Jackie. Hyde's
coming for real this time.

10:26.619 --> 10:28.720
Quick, drink this
old root beer.

10:30.002 --> 10:34.335
You know what? I am so tired of you two lying
about Steven just so you can humiliate me.

10:34.405 --> 10:36.519
Okay, you're right. Let
me make it up to you...

10:36.965 --> 10:38.855
by offering you this

10:39.640 --> 10:42.258
different,
not-old root beer.

10:43.256 --> 10:46.426
Jackie, Hyde is
coming right now.

10:46.462 --> 10:50.060
You know what, Michael? I'm sorry, but
I'm not playing your little game anymore.

10:52.867 --> 10:53.653
Jackie.

10:55.086 --> 10:56.577
Why aren't you in Chicago?

10:57.891 --> 10:59.722
Why do you smell
like a dead dog?

11:02.411 --> 11:04.088
Okay, Donna,

11:04.416 --> 11:06.213
I'm ready for my
going-away present.

11:07.117 --> 11:08.256
Yahoo.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.861
All right, here I come.

11:21.781 --> 11:24.227
Holy mother of Skywalker.

11:25.848 --> 11:28.725
You can do whatever you
want to princess Leia.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.972
Her force field is down.

11:33.499 --> 11:37.186
Donna, this is the best... wait a
second. Leia doesn't have a force field.

11:37.209 --> 11:39.253
You know what? I'm too
excited to quibble. Come here.

11:45.984 --> 11:47.346
I thought you left town.

11:47.792 --> 11:48.811
Why?

11:48.846 --> 11:50.681
Because you're so
amazing and incredible

11:50.717 --> 11:54.765
that I simply couldn't exist in the same town
as you knowing you couldn't make a commitment?

11:54.823 --> 11:57.453
No, because you wrote me a
note saying that you left town.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Well, that, Steven, was a metaphor.

12:04.001 --> 12:07.001
A metaphor for the fact,
that my heart is might gone.

12:07.002 --> 12:09.502
But, my body is still here.

12:12.300 --> 12:15.000
In this very awkward situation.

12:15.638 --> 12:18.221
Want me to cover you up
with the stinky blanket?

12:21.744 --> 12:23.501
Would you guys get lost?

12:23.524 --> 12:26.307
Oh, you want your
privacy. I understand.

12:26.483 --> 12:30.029
We're just gonna go upstairs
and listen through the vent.

12:33.854 --> 12:37.752
So what are you doing here, Jackie?
You got something you wanna say to me?

12:38.503 --> 12:39.396
Yes,

12:41.650 --> 12:44.786
I want to say that I'm
leaving for real this time.

12:44.856 --> 12:47.158
So you came back to tell me
that you're leaving again.

12:47.251 --> 12:48.919
Yes, but this is good-bye.

12:50.081 --> 12:51.537
All right, I'll see
you tomorrow then.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.799
Steven, I'm serious.

12:54.928 --> 12:56.326
So want to hang
out next week?

12:57.159 --> 12:58.040
I'm going.

13:03.030 --> 13:04.216
Unless...

13:06.189 --> 13:08.443
Unless, Steven, there's
something you'd like to say,

13:09.911 --> 13:11.578
in which case,
I'm listening.

13:13.304 --> 13:14.028
Yeah.

13:16.094 --> 13:17.550
Have a good trip.

13:20.451 --> 13:21.273
I will.

13:23.896 --> 13:27.489
Can you guys stand closer
to the vent and talk louder?

13:30.154 --> 13:31.982
Wow, so, uh,

13:32.054 --> 13:34.790
It's like, I can
do anything I want?

13:36.821 --> 13:38.512
Can I touch your buns?

13:39.944 --> 13:42.023
What, you want
to touch my butt?

13:42.610 --> 13:43.866
No, not...

13:44.007 --> 13:46.262
Not those buns. You know...

13:46.849 --> 13:47.776
The Buns.

13:50.277 --> 13:52.320
Eric, that seems
kind of weird.

13:52.649 --> 13:56.134
Yeah. You know what? That
is, like, a little weird.

13:56.639 --> 13:58.975
Maybe I'll just rub my
face up against one of 'em.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.001
Okay.

14:20.247 --> 14:21.151
Leia...

14:23.779 --> 14:24.977
Oh, Leia...

14:30.225 --> 14:34.628
Donna, meet me downstairs for
fried shrimp in T minus 20 seconds.

14:34.663 --> 14:37.399
Wear an old shirt.
These things are greasy.

14:39.078 --> 14:42.377
Wow, that's almost enough to take
you right out of the moment, huh?

14:42.835 --> 14:46.921
Um, okay, Donna. From now on, the
only thing I'd like you to say is,

14:46.956 --> 14:49.011
"Use the force, Eric."

14:50.089 --> 14:52.649
- Okay, that seems kind of...
- Donna.

14:55.925 --> 14:58.109
Use the force, Eric.

15:08.999 --> 15:12.921
Man, and now Mr. Forman is even madder
at me since I saw Mrs. Forman naked.

15:13.825 --> 15:17.735
Doesn't he know I went to catholic school?
I don't even know what any of that stuff is.

15:19.073 --> 15:21.246
Now what exactly
did you see?

15:22.813 --> 15:24.680
And I'm only asking because

15:24.716 --> 15:27.909
I find miss Kitty
attractive in a sexual way.

15:29.248 --> 15:31.702
I know how you can get
back on Red's good side...

15:31.737 --> 15:33.743
walk in on him naked.

15:34.342 --> 15:38.146
No way, man. I do know what that
stuff is, and I don't want to see it.

15:38.944 --> 15:41.915
Seriously, look,
it's perfect.

15:41.962 --> 15:45.732
Look, Red assumes that everyone
is either a pervert or an idiot.

15:45.756 --> 15:47.728
- He thinks I'm both.
- He thinks I'm both.

15:51.192 --> 15:57.400
See, and if you walk in on Red naked, he's gonna
assume that you're the biggest idiot in the world.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.866
That kind of makes sense.

15:59.901 --> 16:03.400
You know, you probably hear this all
the time, but you're really smart.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.000
I do hear that all the time.

16:10.821 --> 16:12.183
Hey, Jackie.

16:12.218 --> 16:14.414
How'd it go with Hyde?
Did he ask you to stay?

16:15.130 --> 16:15.893
No.

16:16.656 --> 16:20.590
But even if he did, I can't stay, because
I've got a career waiting for me in Chicago.

16:21.083 --> 16:24.488
But I am stuck here in this
stupid place with no way out.

16:24.664 --> 16:26.320
Jackie, you know
what would help?

16:27.811 --> 16:29.972
If you eat this
dirty milk dud.

16:31.392 --> 16:32.777
Shut up, Fez.

16:34.304 --> 16:35.243
Jackie,

16:36.288 --> 16:38.308
I'm here for you, okay? So

16:39.083 --> 16:41.032
I'll even give you a ride.

16:41.465 --> 16:42.616
Really?

16:42.663 --> 16:44.612
Oh, Michael, that
would be great.

16:44.659 --> 16:46.479
And I won't do anything,

16:47.372 --> 16:50.554
because frankly, I
don't have much to offer.

16:52.244 --> 16:53.799
You guys smell smoke?

16:53.858 --> 16:56.007
Everyone out of the house!

16:56.676 --> 16:59.271
I used too much
oil in the fry baby.

16:59.776 --> 17:01.971
The whole kitchen's
filled with smoke.

17:02.629 --> 17:04.675
Bob? Bob, are you okay?

17:04.711 --> 17:08.809
Yeah, I'm fine, but my shrimp are ruined.
So I'm gonna have to eat with you guys.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.510
I hope you make something good, Kitty.

17:12.502 --> 17:14.228
Fire! Fire!

17:21.784 --> 17:24.367
What the hell
is on your head?

17:26.269 --> 17:28.105
I'm still wearing
the helmet, aren't I?

17:29.115 --> 17:31.803
What did you do
to my daughter?

17:32.661 --> 17:33.553
Nothing.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.619
I was a perfect gentleman.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.424
I just squeezed her buns.

17:45.425 --> 17:47.825
I suggest a photgraph.

17:48.726 --> 17:51.826
Not a go-go dancer from out of space.

17:54.624 --> 17:57.369
I smell like smoke
from Bob's damn fire.

17:57.404 --> 18:00.492
If Kitty's looking for me, I
went upstairs to take a shower.

18:02.124 --> 18:05.048
Now's your chance
to catch Red naked.

18:06.820 --> 18:09.603
- He's gonna think I'm such an idiot!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.526
Give him enough time
to take everything off.

18:12.573 --> 18:15.215
You don't want to walk in on
him wearing nothing but socks.

18:15.849 --> 18:17.904
That would just make
this whole thing weird.

18:27.316 --> 18:28.478
Oh, boy.

18:30.498 --> 18:32.388
Get back here, you pervert!

18:33.879 --> 18:35.770
That boy just can't
get enough of me.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.283
Sorry my present
didn't work out.

18:42.964 --> 18:43.903
Well...

18:45.418 --> 18:48.152
I mean, we are alone now.

18:49.185 --> 18:53.905
And, uh, I think I know exactly what
might get you back in the mood...

18:54.704 --> 18:56.653
a little romantic music.

19:06.218 --> 19:07.380
Where were we?

19:07.495 --> 19:11.852
Oh, yes, you were a prisoner
aboard the death star.

19:11.887 --> 19:13.049
And I

19:13.542 --> 19:15.585
am the only
stormtrooper

19:16.020 --> 19:18.770
with the keys to your
laser chastity belt.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.271
That's in the movie?

19:21.894 --> 19:23.514
Donna, it's implicit.

19:25.757 --> 19:27.130
God, I'm gonna
miss you, Eric.

19:30.644 --> 19:31.748
I'm sorry.

19:31.983 --> 19:33.133
What was that?

19:35.165 --> 19:37.231
Use the force, Eric.

19:46.940 --> 19:47.914
All right,

19:48.208 --> 19:49.241
here we are.

19:50.074 --> 19:51.741
Good luck in Chicago.

19:53.890 --> 19:57.049
Uh, Michael, this
is the bus station.

19:59.711 --> 20:00.604
Yeah.

20:00.897 --> 20:05.312
I said I'd give you a ride, and then under
my breath I whispered, "to the bus station."

20:06.533 --> 20:07.825
No, no, no.

20:08.656 --> 20:09.419
No.

20:09.466 --> 20:11.239
I can't ride the bus.

20:11.286 --> 20:13.869
Other people's butts
have been on those seats.

20:14.468 --> 20:18.531
Well, I'm not driving you all the way
there. That's, like, two hours away.

20:18.751 --> 20:22.180
Michael, you put this car in gear
and take me to Chicago right now.

20:22.356 --> 20:23.354
You know what?

20:23.516 --> 20:27.755
You haven't changed at all. You're
still just a spoiled little princess

20:27.790 --> 20:33.403
who gets by on her good looks and bitchy
demands and mean and painful pinches.

20:34.608 --> 20:37.461
Yeah, well, you still
don't have any manners.

20:37.497 --> 20:40.597
A real man wouldn't let
the princess ride the bus.

20:41.477 --> 20:42.734
Well, you know what?

20:42.769 --> 20:46.807
You're not even a princess.
You're just a little bossy boss!

20:48.146 --> 20:49.578
That's right, Michael.

20:49.625 --> 20:53.544
I'm the boss, and you're taking
the boss to Chicago right now.

20:53.580 --> 20:55.176
Ow! Fine!

20:56.750 --> 20:59.063
You're always
telling me what to do.

20:59.737 --> 21:01.216
I've missed this.

21:12.091 --> 21:14.017
Please, Mr. Stormtrooper,

21:14.052 --> 21:18.033
I'll do anything you want if you
only spare the planet Alderaan.

21:23.138 --> 21:26.144
Eric, you have a line.
We rehearsed this.

21:28.093 --> 21:29.819
Wait a minute.

21:32.007 --> 21:32.923
Fez!

21:33.839 --> 21:36.751
But I just want to touch the
buns. Let me touch the buns.
