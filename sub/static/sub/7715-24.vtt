WEBVTT

00:01.181 --> 00:02.586
We can get Deangelo flowers.

00:02.752 --> 00:05.965
No{\*, you can't get} flowers for someone{\* who's} in a coma.
They'll wilt before he wakes up.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.550
- Yeah, true.
- Good point.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.051
All in favor of the baskets

00:09.217 --> 00:11.637
full of chocolates,
Teddy bears and balloons.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.213
Wait.
All in favor of the knapsack

00:14.338 --> 00:17.291
filled with canned goods, chainsaw,
gasoline, and emergency radio

00:17.416 --> 00:19.311
in case he wakes up
post-apocalypse...

00:22.130 --> 00:23.482
Nope.
Baskets have it.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.901
So as it turns out,
unless you're a young child

00:26.026 --> 00:27.353
or a prison inmate,

00:27.478 --> 00:29.738
you don't need anyone
supervising you.

00:30.084 --> 00:32.950
People just come in
and do their work on their schedule.

00:33.507 --> 00:36.252
Imagine that.
People like us allowed to sell paper.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.022
Unsupervised.

00:38.147 --> 00:39.498
And yet, somehow it works.

00:40.104 --> 00:42.212
It must be
because the stakes are so high.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.592
I really appreciate the offer,

00:44.717 --> 00:46.964
but I'm just happy
the way things are.

00:51.076 --> 00:53.665
That was Jo asking me
if I wanted to take over

00:53.790 --> 00:55.890
as acting manager
while they find a replacement.

00:56.316 --> 00:57.391
I told her...

00:57.875 --> 00:59.086
I don't wanna mess{\* this} up.{\*, right?}

00:59.211 --> 01:01.312
There's a consensus.
People are happy.

01:07.072 --> 01:08.231
Dwight Schrute.

01:11.870 --> 01:12.907
Yes, I would.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.045
Jordan.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.539
Gather my things from my desk.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.041
Wait...

01:37.892 --> 01:39.100
What have you done?

01:43.362 --> 01:44.363
Mose...

01:45.306 --> 01:47.611
You'll never guess
where I am right now.

{\pos(270,155)}7x24 : <i>Dwight K. Schrute,
(Acting) Manager</i>

02:26.104 --> 02:27.731
Can't stay there all day.

02:27.897 --> 02:28.947
I'm coming.

02:30.829 --> 02:33.028
{\pos(110,268)}Do I at least get to
go with you in this fantasy?

02:34.239 --> 02:35.573
You'd slow me down.

02:35.739 --> 02:39.079
{\pos(120,268)}Dwight has been acting manager
for three months now.

02:39.838 --> 02:41.311
No. A week.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.232
Just feels like three months.

02:44.205 --> 02:47.209
{\*Let's see...}We{\* all} have to punch into a time clock
which is very old,

02:47.375 --> 02:50.375
very strong,
and has a slot{\* about} the size of a finger.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.953
We were all given new business cards

02:53.078 --> 02:55.576
big enough to set us apart
from the competition.

02:55.701 --> 02:58.920
Which is how I learned
our titles are now junior employee.

02:59.387 --> 03:02.729
Our lunch breaks are staggered
to prevent wasting time.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.374
Mine's at 10:30.

03:04.499 --> 03:07.480
And I find the first hour of the day
goes by a lot quicker

03:07.823 --> 03:09.922
{\pos(120,268)}than the second seven hours.

03:10.301 --> 03:11.501
Stop stalling.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.030
{\pos(120,268)}Come on.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.242
{\pos(120,268)}I pledge allegiance

03:20.408 --> 03:23.783
{\pos(110,268)}to the flag
of the United States of America

03:24.537 --> 03:26.665
{\pos(120,268)}and to the Republic
for which it stands,

03:27.121 --> 03:29.499
one nation, under God,

03:29.804 --> 03:30.904
indivisible,

03:31.419 --> 03:34.256
{\pos(120,268)}with liberty and justice for all.

03:34.891 --> 03:36.180
{\pos(120,268)}- Amen.
- Excellent.

03:36.305 --> 03:37.909
{\pos(120,268)}Morning announcements.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.243
{\pos(120,272)}There's been a problem
with some people sharing copier codes.

03:41.368 --> 03:43.997
{\pos(120,268)}Your copier code
is a distinct 21-digit number

03:44.122 --> 03:46.083
{\pos(120,268)}that is unique to you
and you only.

03:46.208 --> 03:47.589
{\pos(120,268)}Okay?
Don't share it.

03:47.714 --> 03:49.279
{\pos(120,268)}Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here{\* today}

03:49.404 --> 03:51.357
{\pos(120,268)}for a high-level meeting
involving Gabe and me.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.151
{\pos(120,268)}- About what?
- That's on a need-to-know basis.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.362
{\pos(120,268)}I thought I needed to know
for your calendar.

03:57.121 --> 03:58.280
General meet and greet.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.662
{\pos(120,268)}{\* I expect you to}Be on your best behavior,

04:00.787 --> 04:03.230
{\pos(120,268)}which means no one{\*none of you}
will be insubordinate

04:03.355 --> 04:05.496
{\pos(100,268)}nor will you foment insurrection.

04:05.662 --> 04:06.462
{\pos(120,268)}Question.

04:06.587 --> 04:09.625
{\pos(120,268)}If we've already fomented insurrection,
may we be grandfathered in?

04:10.982 --> 04:13.045
{\pos(120,268)}- Define foment.
- You define foment.

04:19.317 --> 04:21.220
Please take note
of the new color-coding system.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.144
- What is wrong with you?
- Gotcha! Why are you late?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.688
{\pos(120,268)}It's none of your business{\*, actually}.
It's{\* very} medical and personal.

04:30.854 --> 04:31.854
All right.

04:32.704 --> 04:35.121
You stop me
when I reach the diseased area.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.177
In fairness,
Darryl did tell me that joke, so...

04:48.154 --> 04:49.697
- Darryl's funny.
- I know{\*, right}.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.586
Can I talk to you a second
about these client memos?

04:53.752 --> 04:54.752
Sure.

05:01.373 --> 05:02.469
What's going on?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.266
Are you still in love with Erin?

05:07.790 --> 05:08.601
What?

05:08.872 --> 05:10.022
Because I am.

05:10.422 --> 05:13.105
I need to get her back.
I can't be alone anymore.

05:14.107 --> 05:16.984
Andy, do you like being alone
with me right now?

05:17.408 --> 05:18.944
No. This is horrifying.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.780
I don't like being alone
with me either, okay?

05:21.905 --> 05:23.817
I have to get her back.

05:24.148 --> 05:27.600
- Are you still gonna date her?
- We're just friends, okay?

05:27.725 --> 05:29.114
Do you promise that?

05:29.803 --> 05:32.369
Yeah, fine, I promise.
We'll never date again.

05:32.494 --> 05:33.709
Can we go outside now?

05:33.875 --> 05:35.256
No. Give me a second.

05:35.381 --> 05:37.611
I don't want anyone
to know I've been crying.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.142
What do you think you're doing?
{\*What's this? }What's the fist?

05:50.308 --> 05:52.007
It's just a social club.

05:52.132 --> 05:54.787
Like the French revolution
or the Black Panthers or communism.

05:54.912 --> 05:57.233
It's just a club.
Guys talking. You know.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.568
You expect me to believe
you're starting a rebellion?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.018
Nope. Social club.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.697
I hate when everybody
calls us a rebellion.

06:07.740 --> 06:10.194
You know what?
I would love to join the fist.

06:10.319 --> 06:13.739
And we'd love to have you.
But not today{\*. Unfortunately}, it's a bad day.

06:13.864 --> 06:16.100
What with operation overthrow
and everything.

06:16.563 --> 06:18.504
But I have noted it.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.019
One...

06:49.090 --> 06:50.911
Pam, I have to show you this video.

06:51.358 --> 06:54.249
{\*You're gonna love it. }It's Beyonce falling
with a fart mixed in.

07:02.061 --> 07:04.437
I'll never be happier
than I am right now.

07:04.793 --> 07:06.292
I'll also be never less happy.

07:06.417 --> 07:09.748
I'll be at my current maximum happiness
for the rest of my life,

07:09.873 --> 07:11.257
because I'm manager

07:11.382 --> 07:13.982
of the Scranton branch
of Dunder-Mifflin.

07:15.422 --> 07:16.672
Acting manager.

07:19.610 --> 07:21.268
{\pub}No food now!

07:21.520 --> 07:23.944
Someone has to do something
about Dwight.

07:24.450 --> 07:26.784
He put some snacks
in the freezer for us.

07:27.271 --> 07:29.492
You mean the frozen mice
for the piranha?

07:29.658 --> 07:31.757
No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.

07:32.350 --> 07:33.950
He means the ice pack.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.582
2:00 should probably be okay.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.570
I can either take your number or...

07:39.170 --> 07:40.252
Sorry. Can't wait.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.575
He's gonna call back.

07:42.308 --> 07:43.589
I'm in love with you.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.712
I don't believe in much.

07:46.837 --> 07:50.121
I don't believe in horoscopes.
I don't believe in Christmas.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.223
I {\*sure as hell }don't believe in God.

07:53.341 --> 07:54.141
What?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.938
Maybe there's a God.
I don't know.

07:56.063 --> 07:58.229
It's just not a guy
with a long white beard.

07:59.726 --> 08:00.953
Or it could be.

08:01.078 --> 08:03.900
It's possible
that is exactly what God is.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.492
But for all of the disbelief...

08:07.118 --> 08:08.418
I believe in us.

08:08.908 --> 08:10.407
I believe in love.

08:11.141 --> 08:12.827
You have made me believe

08:12.993 --> 08:15.379
that for all of the hokum...
out there...

08:16.737 --> 08:18.207
Do we not have voice mail?

08:18.659 --> 08:21.210
Dwight doesn't trust robots
to give us our messages.

08:22.914 --> 08:23.915
Well...

08:24.456 --> 08:25.458
It's just...

08:25.738 --> 08:27.388
It messes up my rhythm.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.713
I'm taking a break from dating.

08:30.838 --> 08:34.087
Gabe was a great guy
with so many wonderful qualities,

08:34.399 --> 08:37.101
but it was a challenge
being touched by him.

08:37.267 --> 08:40.187
You've really embraced
the whole <i>Bond</i> villain aesthetic.

08:41.462 --> 08:44.147
The gun is a Beaumont-Adams.
Jo collects them.

08:44.272 --> 08:46.206
We could've some nice{\* small} talk about it.

08:46.331 --> 08:47.838
And the piranha's a rescue.

08:48.903 --> 08:49.905
And the desk.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.534
It's a replica of Uday Hussein's desk.
I saw a picture in <i>Newsweek</i>.

08:53.844 --> 08:56.120
I'm a very busy man.
Let's get right down to business.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.508
Jo is coming later today.

08:57.633 --> 08:59.848
I can't have a subordinate
trying to make me look stupid.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.376
I need you to promise me
you'll be on your best behavior.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.141
I promise... ed other people
that I'd be on my worst behavior.

09:06.605 --> 09:07.882
I gave'em my word, so...

09:08.365 --> 09:09.550
Don't make me fire you.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.660
You can't{\* fire me}.
You're acting manager.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.180
Not office manager.
So you have no firing powers.

09:14.913 --> 09:16.390
Don't make me pre-fire you.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.683
You wouldn't dare.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.431
Watch this.
You're pre-fired.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.731
And when I'm promoted,
you'll be full fired.

09:25.161 --> 09:26.565
If you get promoted,

09:27.067 --> 09:29.028
and if you haven't fallen in love
with me by then.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.154
What?

09:30.320 --> 09:33.662
If I had thought there was a real chance
Dwight would be permanent manager,

09:33.787 --> 09:35.253
I would have pre-quit.

09:35.555 --> 09:38.098
And you might be {\*saying to yourself}thinking,
"that's pretty premature to think,"

09:38.223 --> 09:41.769
but I always say
it's better to be pre-pre-pre-prepared.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.544
- How you doing, Jordan?
- I'm good.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.088
Everyone{\* here} thinks you're a joke.

09:47.576 --> 09:49.006
They think you were hired

09:49.172 --> 09:51.130
because of your good looks,
which won't last long{\* anyway}.

09:51.255 --> 09:53.243
As your pale skin
and severe bone structure imply,

09:53.368 --> 09:54.804
you'll age swiftly and poorly.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.388
Why are you telling me this?

09:56.554 --> 09:59.558
Now I want you to find out
what people are saying about me,

09:59.724 --> 10:02.018
things they don't want me
to know about.

10:11.693 --> 10:12.943
It's a holster.

10:23.311 --> 10:24.461
Looking good.

10:29.885 --> 10:32.758
What a day.
What a day.

10:33.385 --> 10:35.678
Dwight, are you carrying a gun?

10:35.844 --> 10:38.442
The holster was a gift
from my great-uncle Honk.

10:38.936 --> 10:40.808
I guess he's saying he's proud of me.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.602
Guns make me really uncomfortable.

10:43.967 --> 10:46.087
The gun is just an accessory
to the holster.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.436
I can't walk around
wearing an empty holster.

10:48.561 --> 10:50.484
Why do you need
to wear the holster at all?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.778
Why do you need to keep
wearing those booby shirts?

10:52.944 --> 10:53.901
Thank you.

10:54.026 --> 10:55.990
You could put your cell phone in it
instead.

10:56.532 --> 10:57.533
Hello!

10:58.617 --> 11:01.412
- You could put a banana in it.
- Why would I put a banana in{\* my holster} it?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.398
In case you weren't hungry now

11:03.523 --> 11:04.999
but you got hungry later.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.252
No gun, okay?
Don't make us call Jo.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.255
Okay, all right, fine.
Everyone calm down.

11:11.857 --> 11:13.557
Someone get me a banana.

11:13.929 --> 11:15.676
Sorry I freaked you guys out...

11:20.370 --> 11:21.849
It's so loud!

11:26.907 --> 11:29.236
{\pub}There is a hardwood floor
underneath this carpeting.

11:29.361 --> 11:31.011
Why would they do that?

11:32.601 --> 11:34.825
There's like this crazy ringing
going on.

11:35.058 --> 11:36.059
I can't...

11:38.895 --> 11:40.242
I can't find perfect C.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.976
Everyone make a list
of what's lost for the insurance.

11:43.101 --> 11:45.247
I lost a necklace,
a ring, painting...

11:45.413 --> 11:46.612
What happened?

11:46.737 --> 11:49.293
Dwight went on a shooting spree,
and {\*then }he shot Andy in the head.

11:50.345 --> 11:51.976
All we know is that a gun fired.

11:52.101 --> 11:54.100
That's all we know!
No. That's not true.

11:54.225 --> 11:55.949
Actually, we heard a loud noise.

11:56.074 --> 11:57.527
Later, a hole was seen.

11:57.652 --> 11:59.345
No one saw the bullet leave the gun.

12:03.601 --> 12:04.850
{\*Something's}It's definitely wrong.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.057
I'll look on WebMD.
What are your symptoms?

12:07.317 --> 12:10.064
Everybody, Oscar found a reason
to look on WebMD.

12:10.501 --> 12:11.357
Firewall.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.567
I can't reach Jo.
She must {\*already }be on the plane.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.070
- Why are you calling Jo?
- {\*I think }I should go to the hospital.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.404
I'll go with you.

12:18.927 --> 12:20.579
We {\*really }shouldn't be
without a receptionist.

12:20.704 --> 12:21.992
Now more than ever.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.119
I'll take him.

12:23.549 --> 12:24.741
Thank you, Darryl.

12:31.063 --> 12:32.513
What's wrong with you?

12:33.228 --> 12:34.328
It's my ear.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.048
Yes, sir.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.008
I should get
the accident report binder.

12:40.449 --> 12:43.472
I've never used
the gun violence forms before.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.129
I'm gonna keep trying Jo.

12:46.038 --> 12:47.518
Everyone, conference room.

12:47.684 --> 12:48.684
Right now!

12:57.466 --> 12:59.065
Howdy, partners.

12:59.190 --> 13:02.700
It's me, gun-safety Dwight.

13:03.089 --> 13:04.863
And I'm the rootin'est...

13:04.988 --> 13:06.636
I can't do this.
Look.

13:06.761 --> 13:08.701
Obviously,
a gun went off under my watch,

13:08.826 --> 13:10.708
and I'm launching
a full investigation.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.168
We all saw you do it.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.524
Really?
You did?

13:13.649 --> 13:16.380
What hand was I holding the gun in?
What did Andy's tie look like?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.226
Navy blue.
Little red anchors.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.217
I have no way of knowing that{\*if that's true}.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.344
I'm supposed to collect
eyewitness accounts.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.220
Who saw Dwight do this?

13:24.677 --> 13:25.514
Really?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.224
{\*Would you consider}Is this a terrorist incident?

13:27.390 --> 13:29.351
- I felt terrorized.
- Come on.

13:29.666 --> 13:31.854
There's a whole another
terrorism booklet for that.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.675
I just really{\*, really} think
that we should handle this internally.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.673
{\*Dwight, }Why is it on us to protect you?

13:37.025 --> 13:40.154
Because you guys are my best friends,
and I mean that.

13:40.724 --> 13:42.406
Managing you for this last week

13:42.572 --> 13:44.573
has been the greatest honor
of my life.

13:44.698 --> 13:48.329
And if you ruin this,
I will burn this office to the ground.

13:49.298 --> 13:50.842
And I mean that figuratively.

13:50.967 --> 13:53.389
Not literally.
Because you guys are so...

13:53.514 --> 13:55.086
So important to me.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.545
I love you guys.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.757
But don't cross me.
But you're the best.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.487
We're back.

14:04.612 --> 14:05.596
There he is!

14:05.762 --> 14:08.140
Our hero!
You look fantastic.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.518
How you doing? Here.
Tell us your war stories.

14:10.684 --> 14:11.977
{\*Well,}I burst my eardrum.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.689
Doctor said
it could take weeks to heal.

14:15.855 --> 14:16.854
{\*Did they say}And the cause{\*what caused it}?

14:16.979 --> 14:19.443
'Cause {\*I know}you like putting q-tips
deep into your ear canal.

14:20.777 --> 14:21.821
How's your hearing?

14:21.987 --> 14:24.559
Temporary deafness in one ear.
It was both ears.

14:24.684 --> 14:27.034
I couldn't hear{\* a thing } Darryl{\* was saying}
when we were in the waiting room.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.804
I was talking like this.

14:32.227 --> 14:33.671
I don't feel good about it,

14:33.796 --> 14:36.206
but he just kept calling himself
a gunshot victim,

14:36.331 --> 14:37.681
and it got to me.

14:38.295 --> 14:39.646
{\*Dwight, }I would like tomorrow off

14:39.771 --> 14:41.757
so {\*that }I can go
on my <i>American Idol</i> audition.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.360
<i>American Idol?</i>
What? No.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.887
I guess I can just not go.
Do you guys wanna hear my solo?

14:47.625 --> 14:51.892
<i>Why did my temporary boss
Go on a shooting spree?</i>

14:52.058 --> 14:53.591
{\*Fine. }You can go on your singing audition.

14:53.716 --> 14:55.743
Well, then I want
an extra vacation day.

14:55.868 --> 14:58.315
Pet day.
I want pet day back, no dogs.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.193
Put back everything
in the vending machine except the fruit.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.862
I put everything back{\*in the vending machine}.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.836
Put everything back
in the vending machine except...

15:05.961 --> 15:06.907
the fruit.

15:07.265 --> 15:08.701
{\*You have to }Get rid of all your weapons.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.537
All of them.
Including killer fish.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.161
It's my turn?
I'm on the spot.

15:18.286 --> 15:20.921
I don't know.
You know what? I think I'm good.

15:22.017 --> 15:23.007
When Jo's here,

15:23.173 --> 15:26.639
can you work in "shagadelic, baby,"
at least three times in a conversation?

15:26.764 --> 15:28.721
And when I cough,
can you do jazz hands?

15:28.887 --> 15:29.805
What's that{\*jazz hands}?

15:32.541 --> 15:33.542
Fine.

15:48.032 --> 15:50.060
What the fuck is that?

15:54.955 --> 15:55.912
Hey, all!

15:56.311 --> 15:58.155
Cornelius, Bobo, have at it.

15:59.189 --> 16:02.213
Nobody let my dogs hump each other.
{\*They }Don't seem to know they're brothers.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.133
Hello, Jo.
Welcome.

16:04.258 --> 16:06.553
- Well, shall we begin?
- Slow yourself down there.

16:06.678 --> 16:07.494
{\*Just }Like a man.

16:07.619 --> 16:10.054
Wants to jump right into it
while I still got my socks on.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.474
The only man
that ever turned me down.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.735
{\*Well,}I don't know about that.
Just wasn't for me.

16:15.860 --> 16:19.355
But let me assure you,
Dwight is firing on all cylinders.

16:20.206 --> 16:22.281
Well, some pretty big shoes to fill.

16:22.406 --> 16:24.220
I was sorry to hear about Deangelo.

16:24.345 --> 16:26.112
He was a good man.
Tragic.

16:29.871 --> 16:32.159
Well, what can you do?
Life.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.618
- We have to clean this up now!
- She had so much...

16:38.498 --> 16:40.042
{\*Hope }I'm not interrupting anything?

16:42.881 --> 16:45.045
{\*Hey, Andy, }Did you tell Erin
about our conversation earlier,

16:45.170 --> 16:46.966
{\*when you said }you would never want
to date her again?

16:53.763 --> 16:56.392
I{\* just} thought that it was so interesting
that you promised that.

16:57.227 --> 16:59.565
Did I say that earlier?

17:01.354 --> 17:02.354
I did.

17:03.205 --> 17:05.483
Because you, Gabe, were crying...

17:05.650 --> 17:07.987
- No, I was not.
- And sobbing uncontrollably.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.741
You were in hysterics.
And my maternal instincts kicked in.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.411
Is it actually how I feel?

17:22.752 --> 17:23.794
That is...

17:24.522 --> 17:26.223
between me and my diary.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.183
Oscar, can you print out
last year's sale statements?

17:37.567 --> 17:39.351
Gimme a back massage.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.531
{\*No, }Kevin, come on.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.704
My back is sore{\*, Dwight}.
Massage it.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.106
Kevin, not now.

17:48.099 --> 17:49.592
Under the jacket.

17:50.401 --> 17:51.849
You're kidding me.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.284
God, what am I touching?
It's moist.

17:55.765 --> 17:58.187
- I don't feel anything.
- Oh, it's so wet.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.831
- Push harder, Dwight.
- I can't.

18:01.112 --> 18:02.833
I can't push harder!

18:02.999 --> 18:04.335
Go a little higher.

18:06.365 --> 18:08.047
There you go.
Nope. Higher.

18:09.474 --> 18:10.591
Higher.

18:12.584 --> 18:13.761
There we go.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.462
- How's that?
- Knead it.

18:15.587 --> 18:17.139
Knead it like a pizza.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.308
- I'm kneading it!
- But don't eat it.

18:22.143 --> 18:23.687
Dwight.
Walk me out.

18:26.135 --> 18:27.191
Let's talk soon.

18:27.839 --> 18:29.527
And stay on top of these people.

18:29.693 --> 18:30.884
You gotta admit it...

18:31.009 --> 18:33.239
It's nice to have a little power.
How's it feel?

18:39.699 --> 18:42.287
I accidentally fired a gun
in the office today.

18:43.076 --> 18:45.562
I am telling you this
because I care too much about this job

18:45.687 --> 18:47.503
to be blackmailed
into doing it poorly.

18:48.322 --> 18:50.482
All I've ever wanted
is to be manager here.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.733
And if you feel like
you cannot promote me

18:52.858 --> 18:55.132
over this one accident, I understand.

18:55.457 --> 18:57.388
But if you think
that extortion is worse...

18:57.554 --> 18:59.348
Shooting is worse!

18:59.848 --> 19:02.184
Are you kidding me?
It's not even in the same...

19:02.350 --> 19:03.796
You shot a gun?

19:04.031 --> 19:05.396
What is wrong with you?

19:05.562 --> 19:07.022
It was a Beaumont-Adams.{\*if that helps.}

19:07.188 --> 19:09.525
{\*Beaumont-Adams}It is a girl's gun.
That just makes it plain stupid.

19:09.691 --> 19:12.278
- I take full responsibility.
- Who else would be responsible?

19:12.707 --> 19:15.276
Pam made me put a banana
in my holster.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.740
You shot {\*a gun }off...

19:16.906 --> 19:18.191
Did I make a mistake?

19:19.459 --> 19:21.841
Do I regret the decision that I made?

19:22.495 --> 19:26.083
Stop asking yourself easy questions
so you can look like a genius.

19:26.249 --> 19:28.294
- Got it.
- I love you, Dwight.

19:28.656 --> 19:30.506
But you don't fit this job.

19:33.924 --> 19:35.885
- I will...
- No, child.

19:37.827 --> 19:38.846
It's over.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.850
Now I gotta find a replacement
for my replacement.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.571
You three are my search committee.

19:56.135 --> 19:58.491
You're in charge of finding me
my next manager.

19:58.842 --> 19:59.784
All righty?

20:01.289 --> 20:03.449
Till then, we need
a new acting manager.

20:04.051 --> 20:06.457
Now, who's got the most experience
in this office?

20:09.540 --> 20:12.379
Well, we probably don't wanna go
just on seniority.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.888
Who is it?

20:20.621 --> 20:21.472
What's up?

20:21.850 --> 20:22.851
Shut up.

20:24.377 --> 20:26.954
You do know that Jo was right
to take the job away from you.{\*, right?}

20:27.079 --> 20:28.522
There's no debating that.

20:30.303 --> 20:31.524
But I will say...

20:31.690 --> 20:32.763
In your one week,

20:32.888 --> 20:34.610
{\*every single one of }All the orders went out on time.

20:35.983 --> 20:38.851
And I think that is shagadelic, baby.

20:57.413 --> 20:58.490
{\pub}Four.

20:58.615 --> 20:59.551
One.

20:59.676 --> 21:00.762
Seven.

21:00.887 --> 21:01.704
One.

21:01.829 --> 21:04.014
- Another one?
- Seven.

21:04.441 --> 21:06.823
- Could you turn down the beeping?
- Two, six.

21:07.119 --> 21:08.905
Nine, shut up Oscar, eight...

21:09.030 --> 21:11.432
- Nine first, put the nine.
- Nine, eight,

21:11.557 --> 21:12.883
- Five,
- Thank you.

21:13.303 --> 21:14.300
Three,

21:14.684 --> 21:15.685
zero,

21:16.008 --> 21:17.009
zero...

21:17.652 --> 21:18.906
Again, zero.

21:19.830 --> 21:20.831
Four,

21:21.095 --> 21:22.476
- six...
- Nice.

21:22.601 --> 21:23.628
Two.

21:23.875 --> 21:26.128
I hit three,
I head three instead of...
