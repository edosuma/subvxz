WEBVTT

00:10.761 --> 00:12.554
- Morning, everyone.
- Morning, sir.

00:12.764 --> 00:14.015
What have we got today?

00:14.224 --> 00:16.894
We've detected
several phenomenon.

00:17.102 --> 00:19.355
A J'ral-class supernova remnant,

00:19.563 --> 00:22.400
approximately three light-years
off our course.

00:23.735 --> 00:25.738
That's interesting.

00:25.947 --> 00:27.073
What else?

00:28.534 --> 00:33.122
A cluster of three neutron stars.
Very unusual.

00:33.331 --> 00:37.962
How about that.
Three stone-cold stars.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.339
Pretty exciting, huh?

00:41.341 --> 00:42.718
Anything else?

00:43.427 --> 00:48.976
There is one other thing might be
worth swinging by to take a look.

00:49.184 --> 00:52.021
A Minshara-class planet,

00:52.272 --> 00:54.024
about four and a half
light-years away.

00:54.233 --> 00:55.317
Any life signs?

00:55.568 --> 00:58.488
Only about 500 million.

00:58.697 --> 01:03.536
If our scans are right, it looks like
there's a whole civilisation down there.

01:09.460 --> 01:12.798
You might have put that
on the top of the list.

01:14.967 --> 01:20.308
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:22.768 --> 01:26.190
"It's been a long time"

01:26.398 --> 01:30.236
"But my time is finally near"

01:30.445 --> 01:34.700
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:34.909 --> 01:37.829
"I will touch the sky"

01:38.038 --> 01:41.834
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:42.043 --> 01:45.047
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:45.255 --> 01:49.970
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:50.179 --> 01:53.098
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

01:53.307 --> 01:57.897
"I've got faith to believe"

01:58.105 --> 02:00.691
"I can do anything"

02:00.900 --> 02:05.406
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:05.615 --> 02:08.493
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:08.702 --> 02:14.042
"I can reach any star"

02:14.417 --> 02:18.172
"I've got faith"

02:18.381 --> 02:22.094
"I've got faith"

02:22.302 --> 02:27.100
"Faith of the heart"

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074

02:43.121 --> 02:45.039
Put us into orbit at 500 kilometres.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.668
I'm not picking up any other ships
or satellites.

02:47.877 --> 02:48.878
Should we hail them?

02:49.086 --> 02:52.465
Who? I'm picking up dozens of cities
on each continent.

02:52.674 --> 02:54.343
Let's hold off a second.

02:54.552 --> 02:56.846
We don't know whether they're using
high-band frequencies

02:57.054 --> 02:58.348
or smoke signals.

02:58.557 --> 03:00.183
The latter's more likely.

03:00.392 --> 03:03.021
I'm not detecting
any EM transmissions.

03:03.271 --> 03:04.815
Preindustrial?

03:05.024 --> 03:07.234
Well, let's take a closer look.

03:11.197 --> 03:13.242
Do you see that? Just off the coast.

03:13.868 --> 03:14.869
I've got it.

03:17.581 --> 03:19.583
Looks like an old clipper ship.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.545
It's almost like travelling back in time.

03:22.754 --> 03:25.591
I cannot wait to get down there.

03:25.841 --> 03:27.552
I'd advise against that.

03:27.928 --> 03:31.140
It's standard protocol to wait
until a society develops warp drive

03:31.349 --> 03:33.351
before initiating first contact.

03:33.726 --> 03:36.063
Those are Vulcan protocols,
not human.

03:36.313 --> 03:38.483
Starfleet would be wise
to adopt them.

03:39.150 --> 03:40.818
There's no way to know
how our arrival

03:41.027 --> 03:43.280
would affect the evolution
of their society.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.866
So, what are you suggesting we do?

03:46.117 --> 03:50.623
Our sensors can gather
a great deal of data from orbit.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.794
Give me a tighter view
of the city, Hoshi.

03:57.966 --> 04:00.928
Can you get tight enough
to see their faces?

04:03.264 --> 04:04.933
Freeze that.

04:11.857 --> 04:13.902
They don't look so different.

04:14.945 --> 04:16.822
What do you think, Trip?

04:17.031 --> 04:19.242
I think you're right, captain.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.786
You'd be recognised immediately
as outsiders.

04:22.036 --> 04:24.666
Not if we look like them.

04:26.376 --> 04:28.546
Starfleet could've sent a probe
out here to make maps

04:28.754 --> 04:30.966
and take pictures, but they didn't.

04:31.174 --> 04:36.306
They sent us so that we could explore
with our own senses.

05:00.044 --> 05:01.087
You okay?

05:01.296 --> 05:04.090
The acoustic relay is picking up
dozens of languages.

05:04.299 --> 05:06.719
I could spend the next ten years
studying this place.

05:06.928 --> 05:08.889
Well, let's hear some of it.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.909
It'll take a while to work out
a translation matrix for all of them.

05:25.201 --> 05:28.038
We'll be able to narrow it down for you
once we pick a landing site.

05:28.288 --> 05:31.209
I did find the one word you might
wanna remember. Akaali.

05:32.043 --> 05:34.170
It's the name of their species.

05:34.672 --> 05:35.965
A farm.

05:36.173 --> 05:38.551
It's remote and sparsely populated.

05:39.052 --> 05:42.598
If you're exposed, there's a reduced
risk of cultural contamination.

05:42.807 --> 05:46.979
This must be why aliens
are always landing in cornfields.

05:47.604 --> 05:49.147
So...

05:49.983 --> 05:51.693
...who do we send first?

05:52.944 --> 05:55.739
It should stand up to scrutiny,

05:55.948 --> 05:58.994
as long as you don't look too close.

05:59.202 --> 06:02.498
Here. See for yourself.

06:05.836 --> 06:09.132
- It itches.
- You mustn't touch it, ensign.

06:09.340 --> 06:11.301
The irritation will subside.

06:11.676 --> 06:13.721
Are you sure I'm the right person
for this?

06:13.971 --> 06:16.433
If the translator goes down,
you'll be able to handle yourself

06:16.641 --> 06:18.685
- better than any of us.
- The anterior crests

06:18.893 --> 06:21.856
aren't quite symmetrical. I'll add
a little more definition to the right...

06:22.064 --> 06:25.068
We don't need it to be too perfect.

06:25.611 --> 06:27.280
Of course, captain.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.657
T'Pol to Archer.

06:29.866 --> 06:33.078
- Go ahead.
- Please report to the bridge.

06:36.833 --> 06:38.127
Is there a problem?

06:38.336 --> 06:42.257
I'm detecting neutrino emissions
from a city on the eastern continent.

06:42.466 --> 06:43.467
What's causing it?

06:44.009 --> 06:45.678
Possibly an antimatter reactor.

06:46.304 --> 06:48.598
These people don't even have
indoor plumbing.

06:48.848 --> 06:50.809
Maybe some of them
are more advanced than others.

06:51.185 --> 06:54.022
Or maybe we're not the first visitors.

06:54.230 --> 06:57.526
What about nonindigenous
bio-signs?

06:59.111 --> 07:00.488
I'm not reading any.

07:00.697 --> 07:03.241
But at this range,
it's hard to be certain.

07:06.579 --> 07:10.584
Trip, T'Pol, let's head down
to Sickbay.

07:12.545 --> 07:16.425
Let the quartermaster know we'll need
three more sets of clothing.

07:26.981 --> 07:29.984
My feet would be a lot happier
in my own boots.

07:30.192 --> 07:32.362
- What's this?
- Identification papers.

07:32.570 --> 07:35.324
Everyone in the city
has to carry them.

07:39.037 --> 07:40.622
T'Pol.

08:41.909 --> 08:43.702
T'Pol.

09:15.326 --> 09:17.412
- Over here.
- I've got it too.

09:17.620 --> 09:20.582
The reactor's about eight metres
under this building.

09:23.461 --> 09:26.506
Looks like some kind
of a curio shop.

09:41.901 --> 09:43.528
I guess we'll have to wait till morning.

09:43.737 --> 09:45.531
There could be a lot more people
around then.

09:45.740 --> 09:47.908
It might be easier to get a look
at this thing tonight.

09:48.117 --> 09:51.038
Except we're on the wrong side
of this door.

09:51.288 --> 09:52.915
Not for long.

09:56.503 --> 09:59.673
Seventy-eight light-years
to get here...

09:59.882 --> 10:02.052
...our first act is breaking
and entering.

10:02.802 --> 10:05.014
Maybe you don't have to mention
this part in your log?

10:15.736 --> 10:17.988
- Trip.
- Going as fast as I can.

10:46.108 --> 10:48.568
- Archer to T'Pol.
- Go ahead, captain.

10:48.777 --> 10:50.655
I think we found
what we're looking for.

10:50.863 --> 10:54.618
Acknowledged.
We'll meet at your coordinates.

10:54.827 --> 10:56.496
Back here.

11:24.197 --> 11:26.284
The neutrino emissions
are off the meter.

11:26.492 --> 11:28.661
It's gotta be through here.

11:34.753 --> 11:36.212
It's some kind of magnetic barrier.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.882
Can you disable it?

11:38.090 --> 11:39.759
I'll try.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.391
Who are you?

11:46.351 --> 11:47.685
What did you do to that door?

11:48.227 --> 11:50.230
Nothing. Honest.

11:50.939 --> 11:52.692
I wanna know
what you're doing here.

11:53.526 --> 11:56.572
You don't need to point
that weapon at us.

11:56.781 --> 11:59.158
We're collectors.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.119
We're picking up an antique.

12:01.787 --> 12:05.166
A real collector would've waited
until the shop was open.

12:06.709 --> 12:09.630
You're not here to pick up
any antiques.

12:09.838 --> 12:11.299
I've been watching the shop
for weeks.

12:11.508 --> 12:13.885
I know all about
your evening deliveries.

12:14.302 --> 12:15.346
Deliveries?

12:15.679 --> 12:17.723
People are getting sick.

12:17.932 --> 12:20.102
Some are even dying because
of what's going on in here.

12:20.310 --> 12:21.478
Did you know that?

12:21.686 --> 12:23.189
Move away from the door.

12:33.493 --> 12:35.996
- Was that necessary?
- She was armed.

12:36.205 --> 12:39.584
Let's try not to shoot anyone else
while we're here, okay?

12:39.835 --> 12:40.961
I'll try.

12:41.170 --> 12:43.798
The reactor signature's coming
from the other side of that door,

12:44.006 --> 12:47.761
but it's protected by some kind
of energy field.

12:47.970 --> 12:50.598
We should go. It'll be dawn soon.

12:50.807 --> 12:53.436
What about her?
We can't just leave her here.

13:00.820 --> 13:02.321
Hoshi.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.626
Her name is Riann.
She's an apothecary.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.048
I'll meet you back at the shuttle.

13:25.768 --> 13:27.771
What did you do to me?

13:29.230 --> 13:30.775
Nothing.

13:32.276 --> 13:34.362
You just collapsed.

13:35.906 --> 13:37.950
That's the second lie you've told me.

13:38.159 --> 13:39.535
You're not very good at it.

13:40.369 --> 13:42.498
Why did you bring me back here?

13:43.332 --> 13:45.835
Did Garos tell you to?
Are you working for him?

13:46.336 --> 13:48.088
Garos?

13:49.006 --> 13:51.550
You don't know
who I'm talking about.

13:52.134 --> 13:53.845
He owns the shop you broke into.

13:56.557 --> 13:59.185
I'm not working for anyone.

13:59.394 --> 14:01.605
I just wanted to make sure
you got home all right.

14:06.986 --> 14:09.240
Wait.

14:09.490 --> 14:12.494
If you don't work for him,
what were you doing in there?

14:15.373 --> 14:17.917
There's something strange
going on in that shop.

14:18.126 --> 14:21.463
I don't know what exactly,
but I'm trying to figure it out.

14:25.635 --> 14:29.640
I'm an investigator from another city.

14:29.891 --> 14:32.561
Which city? Who sent you?

14:33.270 --> 14:36.899
I can't tell you any more than that.
Not right now.

14:37.860 --> 14:41.656
I suppose telling me nothing
is better than another lie.

14:44.075 --> 14:46.454
My colleague's waiting for me.

14:46.662 --> 14:47.955
I've got to go.

14:48.164 --> 14:51.168
You said something
about a sickness.

14:52.253 --> 14:54.464
I wanted to come back tomorrow
and talk to you about it.

14:54.672 --> 14:56.091
Will you be here?

15:03.016 --> 15:05.311
You didn't tell me your name.

15:07.856 --> 15:08.857
Jon.

15:10.066 --> 15:11.611
Jon.

15:13.196 --> 15:15.616
How far away is this city?

15:29.132 --> 15:31.803
Even if we flatten the building
with a torpedo barrage,

15:32.011 --> 15:34.515
it probably wouldn't make a dent
in that energy field.

15:34.723 --> 15:38.686
What about the shop itself?
Can you scan underneath it?

15:39.395 --> 15:41.899
That's strange.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.611
Sensors aren't picking up anything
under the shop.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.114
No basement, no bedrock.

15:47.322 --> 15:50.201
It's like the building's sitting
on nothing at all.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.830
There must be some kind
of dampening field in place.

15:55.290 --> 15:58.545
Keep your sensors
locked on that shop.

15:58.753 --> 16:01.715
If you notice anything else out of
the ordinary, let me know right away.

16:01.924 --> 16:03.677
Understood.

16:06.596 --> 16:08.516
That woman...

16:08.724 --> 16:11.645
...Riann said something
about people getting sick.

16:11.895 --> 16:13.355
I think we may have seen
some of them.

16:13.564 --> 16:15.817
Mottled skin, lesions on their faces.

16:16.025 --> 16:17.527
If we can get these people
to the ship,

16:17.735 --> 16:19.738
Dr Phlox might be able to tell us
what's wrong.

16:19.947 --> 16:21.824
I'd advise against that.

16:22.033 --> 16:24.619
If I'm not mistaken,
the fear of alien abduction

16:24.828 --> 16:28.416
caused a great deal of apprehension
on your planet for centuries.

16:28.833 --> 16:31.795
Perhaps we should talk
to the shopkeeper first.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.105
Welcome, gentlemen.

16:46.314 --> 16:47.857
If I don't have
what you're looking for,

16:48.065 --> 16:51.278
I'm certain I can find someone
who does.

16:51.487 --> 16:53.072
Can I help you?

16:53.281 --> 16:56.076
We noticed antiques in the window.

16:56.327 --> 16:59.748
My friend here
is an amateur collector.

16:59.956 --> 17:02.959
Were you looking for something
in particular?

17:08.300 --> 17:09.384
These are interesting.

17:09.593 --> 17:13.640
You won't find a more varied collection
in the entire city.

17:13.848 --> 17:18.396
This is the pride
of my entire collection.

17:18.771 --> 17:19.897
Who's it supposed to be?

17:21.233 --> 17:25.238
Draylan, the mythical ruler
of the afterworld.

17:27.406 --> 17:30.286
You're not from this province,
are you?

17:30.537 --> 17:32.122
No.

17:32.330 --> 17:33.999
And neither are you.

17:34.458 --> 17:38.338
Your DNA doesn't match
any other life form on this planet.

17:45.139 --> 17:47.015
Nor does yours.

17:53.566 --> 17:56.903
I see why you have a fondness
for masks.

17:59.282 --> 18:00.283
Who are you?

18:00.533 --> 18:04.371
I'm Captain Jonathan Archer
of the starship Enterprise.

18:04.580 --> 18:07.000
We're explorers from the planet Earth.

18:07.375 --> 18:10.880
Earth? I never heard of it.

18:11.088 --> 18:12.798
How did you know I was here?

18:13.048 --> 18:15.844
We picked up the signature
from your reactor.

18:16.094 --> 18:18.222
Now that you know who we are,
maybe you could tell us

18:18.431 --> 18:19.640
what you're doing here.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.810
I'm an explorer as well.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.812
At least, I used to be.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.441
I'm from the Malurian System.

18:26.649 --> 18:30.237
Two years ago, I led a survey mission
to study the Akaali.

18:30.446 --> 18:32.740
We had no plans to remain here,

18:32.949 --> 18:36.871
but after a few months, I found myself
quite taken with these people,

18:37.079 --> 18:39.123
so I decided to stay.

18:41.001 --> 18:44.004
If you enjoy the simple life so much,

18:44.214 --> 18:48.010
why do you have an antimatter
reactor in your basement?

18:48.219 --> 18:51.723
There's nothing nefarious about it,
I assure you.

18:51.932 --> 18:54.643
The reactor powers
a fabrication device.

18:55.185 --> 18:58.439
It allows me to make food
and clothing.

19:01.026 --> 19:04.447
I don't know if you've heard, but there's
an illness spreading through this area.

19:04.656 --> 19:07.993
Some people seem to think
you're the cause of it.

19:08.244 --> 19:10.539
I see you've met our apothecary.

19:10.997 --> 19:12.374
- You know her?
- She's been making

19:12.624 --> 19:16.087
baseless accusations against me
for months.

19:16.295 --> 19:19.675
There's a lethal virus
spreading among the Akaali.

19:19.883 --> 19:22.345
But it's indigenous.
I certainly didn't bring it here.

19:22.762 --> 19:26.684
Unfortunately, these people don't have
the medical technology to cure it,

19:26.892 --> 19:30.730
so this woman blames
the newcomer, me.

19:33.818 --> 19:36.738
If you wouldn't mind,

19:36.947 --> 19:39.408
we'd like to take a look
at this reactor of yours.

19:41.077 --> 19:42.871
Perhaps some other time, captain.

19:43.288 --> 19:45.374
Excuse me.

19:45.583 --> 19:46.917
Welcome.

19:47.126 --> 19:49.171
If I don't have
what you're looking for,

19:49.379 --> 19:51.883
I'm certain I can find someone
who does.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.801
Gentlemen.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.935
His reactor's got an awful lot of power
for a fabrication device.

20:01.144 --> 20:04.607
He could probably feed and clothe
half the continent with it.

20:04.815 --> 20:07.736
- Archer to T'Pol.
- Go ahead.

20:07.944 --> 20:09.529
How soon can you meet us?

20:12.325 --> 20:14.036
Yes?

20:15.537 --> 20:18.458
- Hello again.
- Hello.

20:19.167 --> 20:20.293
Who's your friend?

20:21.294 --> 20:22.755
Her name's T'Pol.

20:22.963 --> 20:26.968
She's helping me investigate
Garos' shop.

20:27.177 --> 20:31.474
You two have something in common.
T'Pol is a scientist as well.

20:31.682 --> 20:34.102
Your facility's impressive.

20:34.895 --> 20:36.271
Would you mind?

20:36.481 --> 20:39.234
If you're careful
not to touch anything.

20:40.611 --> 20:42.988
You two are from
the same province?

20:43.447 --> 20:44.658
Not exactly.

20:47.244 --> 20:50.665
Must be difficult to make friends
when you keep so much to yourself.

20:50.915 --> 20:53.085
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be evasive.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.171
Yes, you do.

20:56.214 --> 20:58.466
Turn down that flame, please.

21:00.803 --> 21:05.517
I was hoping you could tell us
a little bit more about this illness.

21:08.020 --> 21:11.149
Why don't you tell me why
you were in Garos' shop.

21:15.363 --> 21:18.367
We were trying to get into
the basement.

21:19.493 --> 21:22.956
We think there's some kind
of machine there.

21:23.165 --> 21:26.043
Something he's not supposed
to have.

21:26.252 --> 21:27.503
What kind of machine?

21:28.462 --> 21:30.174
We're not sure.

21:30.382 --> 21:34.637
But it may be indirectly connected
to this epidemic.

21:34.846 --> 21:38.934
If you tell us what you know,
we might be able to help.

21:41.938 --> 21:44.192
I can't tell you much.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.445
People are dying,
and I can't determine why.

21:48.447 --> 21:50.574
Drop this in the water, carefully.

21:53.119 --> 21:55.206
I learned of the epidemic
about 18 months ago.

21:55.414 --> 21:58.125
My brother was
one of the first victims.

21:58.334 --> 21:59.961
I'm sorry.

22:00.879 --> 22:05.218
At first, I thought it was some kind
of airborne contagion,

22:05.426 --> 22:07.930
but it never spread beyond
this part of the city.

22:08.138 --> 22:10.683
I've sampled the soil, the water,

22:10.892 --> 22:12.894
I can't find anything
out of the ordinary.

22:13.102 --> 22:15.814
Why do you believe this Garos
is involved?

22:16.857 --> 22:18.443
The first cases occurred here.

22:21.447 --> 22:23.824
A few hundred metres
from his shop.

22:24.033 --> 22:26.995
That was just one month
after he arrived.

22:27.704 --> 22:29.582
You said something
about evening deliveries.

22:30.416 --> 22:34.213
Every few nights,
someone carries crates from his shop

22:34.421 --> 22:36.800
to different places outside the city.

22:37.008 --> 22:38.760
When I've gone back in the morning,

22:38.969 --> 22:40.805
crates are gone.

22:41.013 --> 22:42.139
Hand me that.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.562
That's why you were watching
his shop.

22:46.770 --> 22:49.691
You thought we were there
for the crates.

22:55.073 --> 22:56.074
What is that?

22:58.285 --> 22:59.662
Tea.

22:59.871 --> 23:01.789
Would you like some?

23:02.791 --> 23:05.294
Jon, may I speak with you?

23:07.046 --> 23:08.172
I'd love a cup.

23:11.135 --> 23:13.429
Did you get what you need?

23:13.638 --> 23:15.849
I should return to the ship
and begin my analysis.

23:16.057 --> 23:18.686
All right. You and the others
head back.

23:18.895 --> 23:20.313
- What about you?
- I'll stay here,

23:20.521 --> 23:23.692
see if I can learn more about Garos
and these shipments.

23:23.901 --> 23:27.322
The longer you remain, the more
you risk cultural contamination.

23:27.530 --> 23:29.658
These people are suffering
from something a lot worse

23:29.867 --> 23:31.952
than cultural contamination.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.956
We've gotta find out what it is.

23:40.255 --> 23:42.341
Enjoy your tea.

23:48.807 --> 23:50.726
Quite impressive.

23:50.935 --> 23:53.146
Did you say this is
a preindustrial society?

23:53.355 --> 23:54.941
Yes.

23:55.650 --> 23:57.777
Her methods may be unrefined,
but this woman is using

23:57.985 --> 24:01.448
forensic techniques far more
sophisticated than I would've expected.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.493
Isn't it extraordinary?

24:03.701 --> 24:08.040
Thousands of sentient species
in our little corner of the cosmos.

24:08.249 --> 24:12.212
Each one discovering science
in their own unique way.

24:13.129 --> 24:16.676
Had this woman been born
on Vulcan or Earth,

24:18.136 --> 24:22.016
I'm sure she would've made
a fine physician.

24:26.522 --> 24:28.858
Here's our culprit.

24:31.403 --> 24:34.949
The water sample's contaminated
with tetracyanate 622.

24:35.157 --> 24:37.953
I'm not familiar with it.

24:38.203 --> 24:42.000
It's a synthetic compound, primarily
used as an industrial lubricant.

24:42.208 --> 24:45.212
Usually under
the strictest safety protocols.

24:45.421 --> 24:47.047
It's quite toxic.

24:47.257 --> 24:49.801
Could this be responsible
for the epidemic?

24:50.010 --> 24:53.681
If it's managed to seep into
the ground water, absolutely.

24:54.892 --> 24:57.144
I'll notify the captain.

25:20.925 --> 25:24.178
Samples from three new subjects
indicate no...

25:24.386 --> 25:26.222
Did you say something?

25:27.432 --> 25:30.645
Sorry. I mutter
what I'm writing sometimes.

25:30.853 --> 25:32.773
It's an old habit.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.445
I have a similar one.

25:37.654 --> 25:40.407
I talk to my dog.

25:44.829 --> 25:50.127
My mother bought me a... once, but it:

25:53.173 --> 25:54.884
What was that?

26:26.799 --> 26:28.175
Are you all right?

26:29.761 --> 26:32.181
- All right?
- Yeah.

26:33.391 --> 26:34.726
I'm all right.

26:36.270 --> 26:39.064
Someone was walking this way,

26:39.273 --> 26:42.611
but he turned
and went around the corner.

26:42.819 --> 26:44.905
I thought if we pretended to be...

26:45.114 --> 26:47.117
I understand.

28:19.609 --> 28:20.944
I want you to head back.

28:21.153 --> 28:24.282
Not before I see
what's in those crates.

28:26.868 --> 28:28.787
Help me open this.

28:31.498 --> 28:33.084
Move!

29:03.331 --> 29:05.333
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

29:08.128 --> 29:09.422
Actually...

29:10.715 --> 29:12.175
...I have.

29:17.265 --> 29:18.892
Stay here.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.850
Jon.

30:55.807 --> 30:57.517
It's all right.

30:58.519 --> 31:00.479
He's not dead.

31:04.025 --> 31:07.488
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me, Jon?

31:13.538 --> 31:15.581
If your ship can travel
to so many stars,

31:15.790 --> 31:17.793
then why would you come here?

31:18.002 --> 31:20.338
- To meet you.
- Me?

31:20.547 --> 31:23.508
Not you personally, but your people.

31:24.677 --> 31:28.306
Why? We're so backward
compared to you.

31:28.515 --> 31:32.145
If you take away our technology,
we're not that different.

31:40.530 --> 31:42.073
Come on.

32:49.701 --> 32:52.621
They're mining some kind
of veridium isotope.

32:52.830 --> 32:55.834
Veridium is primarily used
to manufacture explosives.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.210
I'm not surprised.

32:57.419 --> 32:59.672
Did you find any traces
of tetracyanate?

33:00.047 --> 33:02.509
Their drill bits are saturated with it.

33:02.718 --> 33:04.971
We've gotta shut this all down.

33:05.179 --> 33:08.641
The reactor seems to be powering
the entire operation,

33:08.851 --> 33:12.939
but I can't use my phase-pistol.
I'd risk blowing up half the city.

33:13.189 --> 33:15.692
Captain, let me come down there
and take a crack at it.

33:15.942 --> 33:18.571
I doubt that we have
that much time.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.951
Our best shot is the transporter.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.747
I'll see what I can do about
disengaging that dampening field.

33:25.955 --> 33:28.792
- Give me a few minutes.
- Understood.

33:31.713 --> 33:34.340
I don't suppose you read Malurian.

33:34.549 --> 33:36.343
Can't you use your device?

33:36.552 --> 33:38.847
It wasn't designed for that.

33:39.056 --> 33:40.348
What are we looking for?

33:40.557 --> 33:43.019
There's an energy field
surrounding the shop.

33:43.227 --> 33:45.188
It's keeping my ship
from seeing what's in here.

33:45.396 --> 33:48.817
One of these controls
should turn it off.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.197
- Here.
- What?

33:52.405 --> 33:55.076
This is Tengala Street.
Here's the shop.

33:55.326 --> 33:58.705
This outline could have
something to do with the energy field.

34:01.250 --> 34:03.044
Wait. What are you doing?

34:03.836 --> 34:06.215
If the blue line represents
the dampening field,

34:06.423 --> 34:08.592
this blue button should control it.

34:08.802 --> 34:10.969
- What about the yellow dots?
- What about them?

34:11.179 --> 34:12.973
How do we know
they don't represent the field?

34:13.181 --> 34:15.518
- Maybe it's the yellow button.
- The blue one's lit.

34:15.726 --> 34:17.728
That's what worries me.

34:18.522 --> 34:22.819
We could debate this all day.
Blue or yellow?

34:23.027 --> 34:24.571
Blue.

34:43.887 --> 34:45.806
There's a ship approaching.

34:46.014 --> 34:47.225
From where?

34:47.434 --> 34:50.478
It must've been in a geosynchronous
orbit on the other side of the planet.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.648
I'm picking up
multiple weapon platforms.

34:52.857 --> 34:53.942
They're armed to the teeth.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.152
We're being hailed from the surface.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.448
- The captain?
- I don't think so.

34:59.031 --> 35:00.575
On, screen.

35:01.702 --> 35:04.204
I suggest you leave this system
at once,

35:04.413 --> 35:06.499
or my ship will open fire.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.669
I want to speak with Captain Archer.

35:08.919 --> 35:11.839
That won't be possible. He's dead.

35:13.300 --> 35:14.468
The ship's firing.

35:22.352 --> 35:27.443
My vessel is capable of firing
ten of those charges simultaneously.

35:27.651 --> 35:30.738
Again, I suggest you break orbit.

35:45.883 --> 35:48.219
How did you learn about
this facility, captain?

35:49.345 --> 35:52.432
Was it from a somewhat ugly
Tellarite merchant perhaps?

35:52.641 --> 35:53.976
I told you.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.145
We detected your reactor from orbit.

35:56.396 --> 35:58.399
I forgot, you're explorers.

35:58.649 --> 36:00.401
We're trying to help these people.

36:00.609 --> 36:04.114
What you're doing here
is contaminating their water supply.

36:04.364 --> 36:07.868
There are 500 million Akaali
on this planet.

36:08.077 --> 36:09.996
A few thousand won't be missed.

36:10.872 --> 36:14.210
I'm willing to let you go,
provided you promise not to return.

36:16.088 --> 36:18.674
We've instructed your ship
to send down a launch vehicle

36:18.882 --> 36:21.386
to take you and the woman.

36:22.804 --> 36:23.889
She belongs here.

36:24.223 --> 36:27.644
Believe me, she'll be better off
on your ship.

36:28.520 --> 36:32.150
Now, step away from
the control panel, captain.

36:39.367 --> 36:41.996
If anyone walks through
either of these doors,

36:42.204 --> 36:46.293
aim this and pull the trigger.

36:59.058 --> 37:00.101
They're recharging weapons.

37:00.310 --> 37:02.229
Prepare to leave orbit on my order.

37:02.438 --> 37:05.776
Belay that. Keep this ship
right where it is.

37:05.984 --> 37:09.113
I don't have to reiterate
that I outrank you, Mr Tucker.

37:09.322 --> 37:11.073
Ensign.

37:12.993 --> 37:15.537
- Engineering.
- Billy, stand by to vent the nacelles,

37:15.789 --> 37:17.874
- on my order.
- Yes, sir.

37:18.083 --> 37:19.502
We're not going anywhere.

37:19.752 --> 37:23.047
I didn't say leave orbit.
I said, prepare to leave orbit.

37:23.882 --> 37:29.097
I have no intention of abandoning
the captain, dead or alive.

37:45.117 --> 37:46.327
The dampening field's down.

37:46.536 --> 37:48.496
- Anything?
- I've got a fix on it.

37:48.746 --> 37:50.874
Transfer the coordinates.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.712
The forward hull plating's depolarising.

37:54.963 --> 37:57.550
Evasive manoeuvres.
Keep us within transporter range.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.679
- I'll try.
- Return fire.

38:07.437 --> 38:09.064
They've got some kind
of energy shielding.

38:09.273 --> 38:10.607
Our weapons are ineffective.

38:11.650 --> 38:13.653
- It's the captain.
- Put him through.

38:14.737 --> 38:15.739
How's it going up there?

38:16.115 --> 38:18.909
A Malurian vessel's opened fire.
We're taking damage.

38:19.453 --> 38:22.581
- And the reactor?
- We're trying to get a lock on it now.

38:22.831 --> 38:26.043
Are you all right?
He said you'd been killed.

38:26.294 --> 38:28.422
Don't worry about me.
Just get the reactor.

38:29.173 --> 38:30.758
Jon.

38:35.639 --> 38:38.310
We've lost lateral thrusters.

38:38.518 --> 38:40.145
Commander Tucker, status?

38:40.562 --> 38:42.940
This would be a lot easier
if you'd stop rocking the boat.

38:43.149 --> 38:44.942
How long?

38:45.151 --> 38:47.821
- I've almost got a lock.
- I can't shake them.

38:48.071 --> 38:50.200
Even if we get the reactor,
how are we gonna keep them

38:50.408 --> 38:51.576
from taking it back?

38:55.706 --> 38:58.418
If they want it so badly,
perhaps we should give it to them.

39:32.378 --> 39:34.422
I've got a lock.

39:38.261 --> 39:39.387
Starboard tube's loaded.

39:39.637 --> 39:42.975
Stand by to go to full impulse.

39:43.225 --> 39:44.268
Now, commander.

40:03.917 --> 40:05.712
Fire.

40:15.140 --> 40:16.392
Their shielding is down.

40:16.767 --> 40:18.811
Come about, ensign.

40:19.938 --> 40:22.524
Target their weapons array.

40:32.871 --> 40:34.707
The oil lamp.

40:36.792 --> 40:37.794
What about it?

40:38.003 --> 40:41.674
There should be at least a litre
of residic oil in the container below it.

40:41.883 --> 40:45.846
Residic oil ignites at 398 degrees.

40:46.055 --> 40:48.265
You wouldn't happen to have anything
that gets that hot?

41:15.801 --> 41:16.802
Archer.

41:17.010 --> 41:18.470
The reactor's
been destroyed, captain.

41:18.720 --> 41:23.143
We've disarmed the Malurian ship.
Should we disable their engines?

41:23.686 --> 41:25.020
No.

41:25.229 --> 41:26.606
They're about to leave.

41:27.232 --> 41:29.818
But first they need to pick up
three passengers.

41:30.695 --> 41:33.239
Archer out.

41:33.447 --> 41:36.285
I don't think you're gonna have time
to pack up your shop.

42:01.650 --> 42:05.447
Captain's starlog, July 31 st, 2151.

42:05.655 --> 42:08.284
We've removed the mining equipment
from under the shop.

42:08.493 --> 42:10.244
As far as we can tell,
none of the Akaali

42:10.453 --> 42:12.122
knows what really happened...

42:12.331 --> 42:14.041
...with one exception.

42:14.583 --> 42:17.337
Tell them to take the entire dose.

42:17.545 --> 42:20.591
- Just one?
- That's all they'll need.

42:23.553 --> 42:25.180
What if Garos comes back?

42:25.388 --> 42:26.599
I've notified T'Pol's people.

42:26.807 --> 42:30.229
They're going to look in on you
from time to time.

42:30.437 --> 42:32.856
They could stop by for tea.

42:33.065 --> 42:34.734
You bet.

42:39.031 --> 42:43.161
It's probably best if you...

42:43.370 --> 42:45.206
...keep all this to yourself.

42:47.041 --> 42:48.543
Who'd believe me anyway?

42:49.670 --> 42:51.713
Where is your starship headed now?

42:52.422 --> 42:55.969
There are lots of inhabited planets
to see.

42:57.930 --> 43:01.309
But I doubt many will be
this memorable.

43:12.740 --> 43:14.701
Is your translator broken again?

43:14.909 --> 43:16.620
I'm sorry?

43:16.829 --> 43:20.125
I don't understand a word
you're saying.

43:21.305 --> 43:27.219
