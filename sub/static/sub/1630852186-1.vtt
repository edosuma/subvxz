00:36.333 --> 00:37.166
He's here.

00:38.541 --> 00:40.791
Come on! Come on! We're 15 minutes late.

00:40.875 --> 00:41.708
Come on!

00:42.208 --> 00:45.833
-Just a second! Only the brows.
-Please. There's no time.

00:46.833 --> 00:47.708
Hey!

00:53.125 --> 00:54.041
On the stage.

01:29.458 --> 01:33.041
For the last two and a half years,
many of you have called me a hero.

01:33.291 --> 01:35.208
-Hero!
-So brave!

01:35.291 --> 01:37.500
No, you are wrong, I am no hero.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.208
I'm just an ordinary man
who was brave enough

01:41.291 --> 01:44.500
to refuse to kneel before the terrorists.

01:47.166 --> 01:50.291
That's why...
That's why I can be here today.

01:50.791 --> 01:52.666
My dignity remains intact.

01:52.958 --> 01:54.916
Meanwhile, those rats...

01:55.958 --> 01:58.500
are still hiding in their holes.

01:58.833 --> 02:03.416
GUNA YALA ISLANDS

02:23.666 --> 02:28.250
Some people like those kidnappers.

02:28.875 --> 02:30.166
-No way!
-Yes, believe me.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.625
They find them funny.

02:32.458 --> 02:35.166
And I keep wondering...
is a criminal funny?

02:35.583 --> 02:36.500
-No!
-No!

02:36.791 --> 02:39.833
Can a terrorist be considered a hero?

02:39.916 --> 02:41.083
No!

02:41.166 --> 02:44.000
How about the so-called
Professor Robin Hood?

02:44.083 --> 02:46.208
-No!
-No! Helsinki...

02:48.166 --> 02:49.833
the beast from the Balkans,

02:50.666 --> 02:55.500
kept me suffering for 24 hrs
with an explosive to my chest.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.500
Can he be anyone's idol?

02:57.958 --> 02:59.041
-No!
-No!

02:59.125 --> 03:00.375
I just hope...

03:01.416 --> 03:05.916
he feels guilty for what he did,
every single minute of his pathetic life.

03:07.958 --> 03:13.083
PAMPAS
ARGENTINA

03:34.291 --> 03:36.125
I rushed the so-called Denver,

03:36.208 --> 03:38.125
with just a a pair of blunt scissors.

03:39.583 --> 03:41.000
He had an M16.

03:43.041 --> 03:43.875
Suicidal?

03:44.625 --> 03:48.625
Maybe, but as a result,
the first hostages could escape.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.708
However, in exchange,
he took what I loved most.

03:52.916 --> 03:54.041
Mónica Gaztambide.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.291
-Forget her!
-My lover!

03:56.250 --> 03:58.791
Yes, I've also made some mistakes.

03:58.875 --> 04:01.375
I've also been one of the unfaithful.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.791
One of the selfish and despicable.

04:04.541 --> 04:05.833
As a result...

04:06.333 --> 04:08.333
I lost everything.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.250
Nowadays, every single morning,

04:12.041 --> 04:14.916
I wake up and think
of whatever happened to my son.

And your rotten bananas!

04:30.333 --> 04:31.875
I love you!

04:32.458 --> 04:33.500
Life...

04:33.583 --> 04:36.958
Life is lost
if you don't make your mind up

04:37.250 --> 04:40.000
and you let yourself go with the flow.

04:41.166 --> 04:46.208
I was a hostage, but we have all
been hostages to something.

04:46.958 --> 04:47.833
Yes!

04:47.916 --> 04:49.166
To face that,

04:50.208 --> 04:51.916
you need to make up your mind.

04:52.541 --> 04:54.250
I make up my mind!

04:54.666 --> 04:57.041
I face my problems! Repeat with me!

04:57.250 --> 04:59.125
I make up my mind!

04:59.208 --> 05:01.333
I face my problems!

05:01.416 --> 05:04.958
I make up my mind! I face my problems!

05:05.041 --> 05:08.958
<i>I make up my mind! I face my problems!</i>

05:10.250 --> 05:13.291

<i>Naked, wild...</i>

05:47.666 --> 05:48.750
<i>But with some luxury.</i>

05:58.416 --> 06:00.166
<i>And all of this is about to get fucked</i>

06:00.250 --> 06:02.708

<i>that's about to enter my head.</i>

06:13.458 --> 06:15.333
We've been here for more than two years.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.291
Two years in paradise.

06:20.875 --> 06:23.208
Paradise is wonderful
when your life is dull...

06:23.958 --> 06:25.208
and full of traffic jams...

06:26.458 --> 06:27.666
so you go there sometimes.

06:35.791 --> 06:37.916
You need a change of scenery, don't you?

06:40.625 --> 06:42.166
And I'm not a part of the plan...

06:43.625 --> 06:44.458
am I?

06:56.375 --> 06:57.666
We had a good run.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.166
Rio...

07:07.000 --> 07:08.208
I need to get out of here.

07:10.416 --> 07:11.333
I need the hubbub.

07:12.375 --> 07:13.666
I need people.

07:15.958 --> 07:18.041
I need not to know where I'll be tomorrow.

07:19.916 --> 07:21.083
I get it.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.166
I'll also leave.

07:26.833 --> 07:28.541
An adventure will do us both good.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.375
It may be for a bit,
but I can't be sure.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.666
Best to say it's forever.

08:44.666 --> 08:46.041
In case we want to talk.

08:46.416 --> 08:49.708
It's a satellite phone. I bought it
on the black market with Helsinki.

08:49.791 --> 08:51.291
-Rio...
-It's unregistered.

08:52.958 --> 08:54.833
Turn it on every three days, at 6:00 p.m.

08:54.916 --> 08:57.625
If either of us needs to call,
turn it on for five minutes

08:57.708 --> 08:59.416
then off again if there's no contact.

09:00.125 --> 09:00.958
Okay?

09:05.208 --> 09:06.458

That's her.

13:17.791 --> 13:18.750
Hey, Tokyo.

13:19.291 --> 13:20.500
Confirmed. It's Tokyo.

13:20.875 --> 13:21.833

That's what I want.
I don't want to be with these guys!

14:14.166 --> 14:15.916
<i>That's what I want, Tokyo, fuck!</i>

14:19.125 --> 14:20.416
Even if it's just a date.

14:21.833 --> 14:22.916
So you want a date?

14:23.333 --> 14:25.000
Of course I want a date.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.416
Then pick a city.

<i>And I'll be there.</i>

-Patrol boats.
-What?

Patrol boats!

-Lower your guns!

16:49.750 --> 16:50.833
Easy. Lower your guns.

<i>Negative. It's not her.</i>

Come on!

18:52.875 --> 18:53.916
Rich!

19:05.416 --> 19:07.625
Finish the champagne.
We need new guidelines.

19:07.708 --> 19:08.708
Professor...

19:09.166 --> 19:10.250
Come on.

19:11.625 --> 19:14.875
We have 10 million now.
Do you think we're going back to school?

19:17.041 --> 19:19.875
We've managed to escape,
but now comes the most difficult part.

19:23.458 --> 19:24.875
Staying alive.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.166
Don't open them yet,
wait until you're on your own.

19:28.958 --> 19:31.250
-What's this?
-Safe houses. Every couple has one.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.208
So you and Helsinki
will stick together?

19:37.666 --> 19:38.875
Of course.

19:38.958 --> 19:39.791
Great.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.625
You'll be under protection
and surveillance.

19:42.708 --> 19:44.791
So, Interpol's reach will be very weak.

19:44.875 --> 19:47.500
-Not now, Denver.
-I didn't do anything.

19:48.416 --> 19:51.208
Open them when you're on your own.

19:52.333 --> 19:56.666
I'm the only one who should know
your whereabouts at any given moment.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.750
What are those numbers for?

20:03.416 --> 20:05.250
Each number belongs to a continent.

20:06.083 --> 20:10.041
A continent on which
you might find yourself in need of help.

20:10.625 --> 20:11.833
Commit them to memory.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.500

21:40.625 --> 21:43.166
I hope you won't ever need
to find out, Miss Tokyo.

21:55.958 --> 21:57.041
<i>But that day came.</i>

22:00.416 --> 22:02.041
THAILAND
62 DAYS UNTIL D-DAY

22:02.125 --> 22:04.500
<i>I imagine the same happens</i>
<i>in every paradise.</i>

22:04.791 --> 22:06.875
<i>In the end, someone bites the apple</i>

22:07.791 --> 22:09.125
<i>and everything goes to shit.</i>

22:09.583 --> 22:10.541
Let's go.

22:35.875 --> 22:38.333
Go in. They'll come for you.

23:04.625 --> 23:08.041
<i>It took me 11 days to reach the temple</i>
<i>where my handler left me.</i>

23:08.666 --> 23:12.708
<i>After an oil tanker, two cargo planes</i>
<i>and who knows how many buses...</i>

23:12.916 --> 23:13.875
Miss Tokyo.

23:14.375 --> 23:16.041
<i>...my guardian angel appeared.</i>

23:21.750 --> 23:23.125
Welcome to Thailand.

23:30.583 --> 23:31.416
Hello.

23:32.541 --> 23:35.000
I don't think I've ever been so happy
to see somebody.

24:01.666 --> 24:02.708
Professor...

24:05.208 --> 24:06.250
Have you heard from Rio?

24:34.333 --> 24:35.291
Mom!

24:35.916 --> 24:36.791
Mom!

24:36.875 --> 24:38.500
PALAWAN
62 DAYS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

24:38.583 --> 24:41.416
Mom! Mom, are you okay?

24:41.500 --> 24:42.583
Are you okay?

24:43.500 --> 24:44.458
Are you cold?

24:48.208 --> 24:50.500
Let's get out of the water.

24:52.333 --> 24:53.500
Come on.

24:54.041 --> 24:55.333
Yes, yes...

25:01.125 --> 25:02.166
What happened, Mom?

25:02.250 --> 25:04.458
It's okay, darling. Grandma was just...

25:08.250 --> 25:10.500
My mom was fully dressed
in the water again.

25:10.583 --> 25:12.208
The water felt so good...

25:13.875 --> 25:14.833
Raquel.

25:17.166 --> 25:18.916
How did your trip go, darling?

25:22.541 --> 25:23.708
Pack your bags.

25:24.666 --> 25:25.625
What's going on?

25:28.083 --> 25:28.916
Tokyo's here.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.083
Raquel, Raquel...

25:32.666 --> 25:34.458
Until we know for sure what's happened,

25:34.541 --> 25:37.125
you must take your mother
and your daughter to Mindanao.

25:38.791 --> 25:41.708
And even though this place isn't safe,
you're going to stay.

25:42.791 --> 25:43.625
It's for the best.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.916
Because you have to fix a problem
for Tokyo.

25:48.708 --> 25:49.875
On your own.

26:07.416 --> 26:09.875
If you are thinking of hiding me
so she won't see me,

26:09.958 --> 26:11.625
you'd better think again.

26:38.625 --> 26:41.125
-What's that bitch doing here?
-Calm down. She's one of us now.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.916
Put it this way. I changed sides.

26:44.291 --> 26:45.958
You know who changes sides during a war?

26:46.041 --> 26:47.750
-Traitors.
-Tokyo...

26:47.833 --> 26:49.500
-The lowest of the low.
-Tokyo!

26:50.000 --> 26:51.791
You know what happens with those rats?

26:52.750 --> 26:55.041
They can change sides once, twice,

26:55.541 --> 26:56.875
a hundred million times.

26:56.958 --> 26:58.958
-Tokyo, please...
-She'll betray you!

26:59.958 --> 27:01.833
She'll betray you as she betrayed them.

27:01.916 --> 27:03.208
-That won't happen.
-Why not?

27:03.916 --> 27:05.250
How can you know? Tell me!

27:05.333 --> 27:06.250
-I know.
-Really?

27:06.333 --> 27:08.708
-And I'm absolutely sure.
-Sure?

27:08.791 --> 27:09.666
Down in your pants?

27:12.583 --> 27:15.416
If the Professor tells you I'm one of you,
then I'm one of you.

27:16.125 --> 27:16.958
Is that clear?

27:17.583 --> 27:19.166
Nice smack you delivered.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.125
We're not going to get along like that,
Inspector

27:26.625 --> 27:27.500
Lisbon.

27:28.166 --> 27:29.583
My name is Lisbon.

27:33.833 --> 27:37.708
Well, afterrthis touching reunion,

27:37.791 --> 27:39.833
let's go have some tea.

27:42.666 --> 27:43.583
Please.

27:48.916 --> 27:49.875
-Hands up!
-Get down!

27:50.000 --> 27:51.125
I told you to get down!

27:51.208 --> 27:53.583
Hands behind your back!

27:53.666 --> 27:54.875
Don't move!

27:58.625 --> 27:59.916
How long ago was that?

28:01.500 --> 28:02.375
Eleven days.

28:03.833 --> 28:05.833
Where did you get the satellite phones?

28:07.750 --> 28:09.166
When we split into two ships,

28:09.250 --> 28:11.291
we were in port in Casablanca
for 24 hours.

28:12.666 --> 28:14.291
He bought them on the black market.

28:15.708 --> 28:16.708
From a Libyan.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.541
In Casablanca...

28:19.625 --> 28:20.833
They were unregistered.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.500
Of course they were.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.041
Not only that...

28:25.083 --> 28:26.833
The vendor sold us out

28:27.000 --> 28:29.375
for the reward money.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.125
Professor...

28:33.541 --> 28:35.750
Are you completely sure Rio's been caught?

28:37.041 --> 28:39.750
He'd have rung his handler like you.
Don't you think?

28:40.333 --> 28:41.791
But nothing's been published.

28:43.916 --> 28:45.333
He was arrested 11 days ago.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.250
It's the best news
the government can announce.

28:48.750 --> 28:52.333
Why would they keep it secret?
It's a bombshell.

29:02.583 --> 29:04.750
How long can they keep him hidden?

29:05.875 --> 29:07.333
Seventy-two hours.

29:09.583 --> 29:10.708
Where's he being held?

29:14.291 --> 29:15.375
They're not torturing him, are they?

29:16.583 --> 29:18.291
I don't know, Tokyo. I don't know.

29:20.458 --> 29:21.916
Of course he's being tortured.

29:22.875 --> 29:24.916
In any democratic country,

29:25.000 --> 29:29.166
there's a backyard for playing dirty
in case things turn nasty.

29:29.541 --> 29:31.541
And we've made things very nasty for them.

29:33.833 --> 29:35.500
Well, you did.

29:35.583 --> 29:37.041
They can't torture him.

29:38.041 --> 29:39.416
It's the 21st century.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.541
Sure they can.

29:43.166 --> 29:46.291
At a height of 35,000 feet,
above any jurisdiction,

29:46.833 --> 29:50.208
on the CIA flights or in Guantanamo.

29:50.291 --> 29:51.958
Even Spain had terrorist commandoes.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.333
Are you fucking kidding me, Tokyo?
Were you born yesterday?

29:55.291 --> 29:56.458
Professor.

29:59.250 --> 30:00.708
We need to get Rio out.

30:00.791 --> 30:02.000
Are you listening?

30:03.125 --> 30:04.458
We need to rescue Rio.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.291
Did you buy any more phones?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.375
Yes. Helsinki.

30:22.750 --> 30:24.208
We have to gather everyone.

30:32.791 --> 30:33.625
Professor!

30:35.083 --> 30:36.000
Professor!

30:39.250 --> 30:40.750
Tell me you're going to save Rio.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.458
How, Tokyo?

30:44.125 --> 30:48.666
We don't even know what country,
prison or goddamn hole he is in.

30:49.791 --> 30:51.125
We know nothing.

30:52.458 --> 30:53.375
Nothing.

31:32.083 --> 31:33.375
Professor!

31:41.333 --> 31:43.041
Professor!

31:46.291 --> 31:47.791
I'm so happy to see you.

31:47.875 --> 31:48.708
So happy.

31:48.791 --> 31:51.833
-Miss Gaztambide.
-You can say "Mrs"! We got married!

31:52.416 --> 31:54.750
Balinese rites,
an elephant and everything.

31:56.750 --> 31:57.666
Tokyo!

31:57.750 --> 31:59.000
Tokyo!

32:00.125 --> 32:01.916
Tokyo! Tokyo!

32:02.000 --> 32:03.416
Do you want to come with me?

32:18.416 --> 32:20.583
Professor!

32:21.791 --> 32:24.291
Professor!

32:25.750 --> 32:27.416
Slow down, Helsinki!

32:28.375 --> 32:30.958
Slow down, this is not funny!

32:31.041 --> 32:31.916
Helsinki!

32:46.125 --> 32:47.458
Asshole!

32:48.083 --> 32:49.250
My dress!

32:53.000 --> 32:54.125
What's up?

32:54.458 --> 32:56.250
Nobody is going to hug me or what?

33:04.041 --> 33:06.791
Let's toast in silence.
Don't wake the boy up.

33:06.875 --> 33:08.583
Say it with an Argentinian accent.

33:08.666 --> 33:11.833
Hey, <i>boludo.</i>
Listen to me, congratulations.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.083
The worst Argentinian accent
I've ever heard. For real.

33:16.166 --> 33:18.833
-Your house is so beautiful.
-It feels like heaven in here.

33:18.916 --> 33:20.166
-Where's Rio?
-He knows.

33:21.000 --> 33:21.958
Rio isn't coming.

33:25.833 --> 33:26.958
He's been arrested.

33:29.291 --> 33:30.375
When was that?

33:30.458 --> 33:32.583
Seventeen days ago on a Caribbean island.

33:34.041 --> 33:35.416
It hasn't made the papers.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.375
He's in some shithole, being tortured.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.500
How did they find him?

33:44.041 --> 33:45.625
He used a satellite phone.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.708
Was he in danger?

33:53.500 --> 33:54.333
No.

33:59.666 --> 34:00.666
There were rules.

34:02.375 --> 34:03.291
No Europe.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.875
No phones.

34:05.125 --> 34:06.875
What the fuck are we doing here?

34:07.750 --> 34:09.166
For safety reasons.

34:09.250 --> 34:10.833
Safety reasons, what safety reasons?

34:10.916 --> 34:12.583
Rio didn't know where we were.

34:12.666 --> 34:13.750
Guys...

34:15.416 --> 34:16.375
We must help him.

34:16.458 --> 34:20.500
Let's see...
What the fuck are we doing here?

34:21.291 --> 34:23.791
Do you really think
we're going to rescue Rio?

34:23.875 --> 34:24.833
Yes, Denver.

34:27.583 --> 34:28.625
That's exactly what I think.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.291
Jesus Christ...

34:40.083 --> 34:43.250
You made me cross the world
with a small baby to tell me that shit?

34:43.333 --> 34:45.166
Are you smoking opium
in Asia, Professor?

34:45.250 --> 34:46.333
Please, sit down.

34:46.416 --> 34:49.166
This isn't a fucking video game.
You're not my boss.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.125
Sit down.

34:50.541 --> 34:52.500
You owe me your fucking life!

34:53.083 --> 34:54.250
Do you understand that?

34:54.333 --> 34:58.041
You owe me all this. That fucking backyard
and even that fucking sea

34:58.125 --> 35:01.458
because you can't bring my dad back.
Got it?

35:03.833 --> 35:05.250
Listen, I have a son.

35:05.333 --> 35:09.083
I fucking swear I won't let him suffer
as much as I did.

35:09.166 --> 35:10.791
Ask him yourself

35:11.000 --> 35:14.208
if he wants his daddy to get riddled
with bullets.

35:14.291 --> 35:15.125
Denver.

35:16.833 --> 35:19.750
He's being plunged into a bathtub,
with a bag around his head.

35:19.833 --> 35:22.666
-Do you understand?
-Sorry but that's his fucking problem.

35:22.750 --> 35:23.875
That face...

35:24.500 --> 35:26.083
you're looking at

35:26.916 --> 35:28.833
is the same face
your dad was looking at

35:28.916 --> 35:30.750
while you were trying
to dig the tunnel.

35:34.458 --> 35:36.458
She didn't leave his side,
not for a second.

35:39.250 --> 35:40.083
Tokyo was there.

35:44.625 --> 35:46.041
Rio made a mistake.

35:49.458 --> 35:51.000
But you also made some mistakes.

35:52.166 --> 35:55.666
You dragged your dad to the rooftop.
You two could have been killed.

35:56.875 --> 35:58.250
But the gang was there.

36:00.208 --> 36:03.833
Helsinki, you took the car
to the scrapyard, but didn't crush it.

36:03.916 --> 36:05.125
We fixed it.

36:05.625 --> 36:07.166
The gang was there.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.333
You stopped the machines late,

36:11.541 --> 36:12.416
Nairobi.

36:13.708 --> 36:15.250
And the police came in.

36:17.125 --> 36:19.833
And you could escape through the tunnel
because Berlin...

36:21.541 --> 36:24.416
stayed to hold them back.

36:24.875 --> 36:26.833
He gave us the seconds we needed.

36:27.875 --> 36:29.500
The gang was there.

36:31.833 --> 36:33.000
The one not here now...

36:37.583 --> 36:38.583
is Berlin.

36:40.416 --> 36:41.541
Neither is Oslo.

36:44.416 --> 36:45.625
Nor Moscow.

36:54.791 --> 36:56.166
No way...

37:03.208 --> 37:04.416
She's one of us.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.500
I made a mistake.

37:12.041 --> 37:13.166
I lost control.

37:14.458 --> 37:15.833
But the gang was there.

37:28.541 --> 37:32.208
Now Rio has made a mistake,
like we all have.

37:34.583 --> 37:37.458
I can't ask you
to feel what I feel, but...

37:40.166 --> 37:42.333
I feel truly responsible

37:43.750 --> 37:46.750
that some... son of a bitch...

37:48.875 --> 37:51.916
is giving him electric shocks
while he hangs from his ankles.

38:00.208 --> 38:01.250
I'll go!

38:05.166 --> 38:06.375
You're not going, Nairobi.

38:08.375 --> 38:10.791
Because if you're going, I'm going too.

38:12.041 --> 38:13.458
Here we go again.

38:50.833 --> 38:52.166
How are we going to rescue Rio?

38:54.125 --> 38:56.458
With a robbery. That's what we're good at.

38:57.208 --> 38:59.208
A robbery? That's how we'll rescue him?

38:59.291 --> 39:00.541
It will begin with...

39:01.250 --> 39:02.208
a robbery.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.333
But...

39:06.416 --> 39:08.666
But we're really going to defy the system.

39:11.666 --> 39:15.625
This time we won't be those guys
who kidnap people to make their own money.

39:17.541 --> 39:19.500
We'll be the guys who take a stand.

39:22.166 --> 39:24.666
The guys who say, "Enough is enough."

39:25.166 --> 39:27.541
What they're doing to Rio
is a declaration of war.

39:28.916 --> 39:30.916
And we are the resistance.

39:31.791 --> 39:32.791
Right?

39:34.583 --> 39:36.000
What are we going to rob?

39:37.875 --> 39:38.875
The gold.

39:38.958 --> 39:39.958
Gold?

39:41.250 --> 39:42.125
Not just gold.

39:43.416 --> 39:44.375
<i>The </i>gold.

39:45.041 --> 39:46.458
The only gold that matters.

39:50.083 --> 39:52.250
The national reserve of the Bank of Spain.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.625
That's a big one, isn't it?

39:56.708 --> 39:58.333
Never bigger.

39:59.333 --> 40:02.083
And that idea just came to you now,
looking at the sunrise?

40:07.041 --> 40:08.458
No, it's not my plan.

40:09.083 --> 40:10.041
Your father's?

40:14.541 --> 40:16.041
No. It's not my father's.

40:21.916 --> 40:25.583
FLORENCE
5 YEARS LEFT UNTIL D-DAY

40:41.083 --> 40:42.041
Andrés.

40:48.083 --> 40:49.541
Little brother.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.666
Welcome to Italy.

41:00.833 --> 41:03.416
A country with art, class...

41:03.500 --> 41:07.375
where people are stylishly dressed.
Unlike you.

41:07.458 --> 41:09.166
You look like a traveling salesman.

41:13.875 --> 41:14.875
Follow me.

41:21.458 --> 41:23.041
I'm taking you to my humble abode.

41:23.875 --> 41:25.833
I've got so much to tell you.

41:35.625 --> 41:38.625
This is "the humble abode
in the country" you were going to rent?

41:39.625 --> 41:42.583
You begin a search for a house
with two bathrooms and a garden,

41:42.916 --> 41:45.250
and end up renovating a monastery.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.791
I know how to break into the Royal Mint.

41:51.875 --> 41:53.250
Through the door?

41:53.333 --> 41:56.250
The back door. On the truck
with the with the spools of paper.

41:59.791 --> 42:01.208
Andrés, there's people here.

42:01.291 --> 42:04.208
Don't worry, we don't cross paths.
They're the perfect neighbors.

42:04.291 --> 42:05.583
-They're monks!
-Cistercians.

42:06.166 --> 42:08.375
They live in one wing,
we're in the other.

42:08.458 --> 42:10.750
Besides, they swore a vow of silence.

42:10.833 --> 42:12.208
They swore to remain silent.

42:12.291 --> 42:14.625
Not before a gun, or a judge,

42:14.708 --> 42:16.458
but before God Almighty.

42:17.083 --> 42:18.958
Much more interesting, isn't it?

42:21.625 --> 42:22.541
And...

42:22.625 --> 42:23.958
what did you tell them?

42:24.583 --> 42:27.250
That I'm an intellectual
in need of austerity and solitude

42:27.333 --> 42:29.916
so I can write a treaty
on theological philosophy.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.125
Did they believe you?

42:31.208 --> 42:32.916
I also paid for the refurbishment

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
so they didn't have to turn this beauty
into a hotel.

42:36.083 --> 42:38.458
They don't need anything else.
They adore me.

42:38.916 --> 42:41.750
Sometimes I even sing
Gregorian chants with them.

42:43.208 --> 42:44.125
Watch your head.

42:46.500 --> 42:48.583
Andrés, do you sleep in a cell?

42:48.666 --> 42:51.708
I intended to. But I fell in love...

42:53.791 --> 42:55.083
with this chapel.

43:00.375 --> 43:01.541
It's wonderful, isn't it?

43:28.458 --> 43:32.291
Sergio, my dearest friend.
Long time no see. Come here.

43:32.375 --> 43:33.291
What's all this?

43:34.166 --> 43:37.541
Do you remember the plan to rob the gold
from the Bank of Spain?

43:37.625 --> 43:41.750
It's amazing. We can obtain
up to 90 tonnes of gold from there.

43:41.833 --> 43:43.625
We found the answer.

43:43.875 --> 43:45.125
And I think you'll love it.

43:45.916 --> 43:49.583
It's the most intelligent piece of civil
engineering since the Panama Canal...

43:49.666 --> 43:51.041
Wait a minute.

43:51.125 --> 43:54.458
I've told you a million times:
you may get the gold, but, Andrés,

43:54.541 --> 43:56.875
there's no way
you'll leave the Bank of Spain alive.

43:58.583 --> 44:01.500
Those are just insignificant details.
The gold comes first.

44:01.583 --> 44:03.333
We'll deal with
the people after, okay?

44:03.416 --> 44:07.041
-What do you mean "insignificant details"?
-Let's think about it later.

44:07.125 --> 44:09.583
Don't you think
I look a bit different?

44:09.666 --> 44:12.083
-Well...
-I have to tell you about a woman.

44:14.666 --> 44:15.916
Look at this...

44:16.458 --> 44:17.583
little cutie.

44:18.583 --> 44:20.041
Let me introduce you to Tatiana.

44:21.083 --> 44:22.458
Yes, she's really pretty.

44:22.541 --> 44:24.250
She's madly in love.

44:25.458 --> 44:26.583
A goddess.

44:30.958 --> 44:32.875
<i>The Professor never imagined</i>

44:34.166 --> 44:35.291
<i>that one day</i>

44:36.083 --> 44:38.291
<i>he would have to make</i>
<i>that suicidal plan his own.</i>

45:39.916 --> 45:41.458
WELCOME

45:49.125 --> 45:51.125
BACK

45:54.291 --> 45:56.500
Okay. Most of you know the rules,

45:56.583 --> 45:59.333
but since there are some new faces,
we'd better review them.

45:59.416 --> 46:02.333
First of all, no personal relationships.

46:04.791 --> 46:06.458
Well, that rule's been...

46:08.708 --> 46:12.458
The second rule is:
no first or last names.

46:12.541 --> 46:13.625
Professor.

46:14.375 --> 46:18.208
Let's get down to business. How are we
going to break into the Bank of Spain?

46:32.083 --> 46:33.208
By making a racket.

46:33.791 --> 46:37.833
MADRID
D-DAY

47:03.208 --> 47:04.291
<i>Nowadays,</i>

47:04.833 --> 47:06.958
<i>wars start with bombings.</i>

47:07.041 --> 47:08.208
<i>Ours did as well.</i>

47:30.458 --> 47:32.625
<i>That day, 140 million euros</i>

47:32.708 --> 47:34.041
<i>poured out over Madrid.</i>

47:50.083 --> 47:51.708
<i>That was our way of saying...</i>

47:52.833 --> 47:54.333
<i>"We're back."</i>
