Two.

04:38.429 --> 04:40.029
You're a genius.

04:40.031 --> 04:42.130
No wonder they hired you
to teach math.

04:42.132 --> 04:44.567
I thought it was because
of my incredible charm...

04:44.569 --> 04:46.667
and my devilish handsome,
good looks.

04:46.669 --> 04:51.537

you and let you knock me up.

Yeah. And you must be
Mrs. Pierce.

- Yeah.

05:47.955 --> 05:49.587

David?

05:49.589 --> 05:51.288
Class doesn't start till Monday.

05:51.290 --> 05:53.623
I've got your keys, professor.

05:53.625 --> 05:56.658
Yeah, they give them to all
their students.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.595
Nah, I'm just kidding. It's a...
it's a work study program.

The university pays me to keep
up some of the properties.

around here.

06:14.509 --> 06:16.075
Oh, is that safe?

06:16.077 --> 06:18.044
Well, in my experience most
people's problems...

06:18.046 --> 06:19.415
happen behind closed doors.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.582
Oh, yeah, professor,
uh, someone sent you a gift.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.151
I put it inside.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.718
Gift?

really need a math teacher.

- Wow.
- Yes.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.748
Still missing the city?

07:01.750 --> 07:03.582
Not anymore.

07:03.584 --> 07:08.120
I think this table alone is
bigger than our old apartment.

07:08.122 --> 07:10.254
It's from your sister.

07:10.256 --> 07:13.590
Do I dare ask how it got here
before we did?

07:13.592 --> 07:15.457
Be nice. I gave her the address.

07:15.459 --> 07:18.193
The last time we saw your
sister, she almost burned...

07:18.195 --> 07:19.762
down our apartment with candles
and incense.

07:19.764 --> 07:22.631
It's a house-warming gift.
She's not so bad.

07:22.633 --> 07:25.503
As long as she doesn't pop out
of here, I'll agree with you.

07:28.772 --> 07:30.705
LISA: That's beautiful.

07:30.707 --> 07:32.205
Beautiful.

07:32.207 --> 07:34.240
Your sister sent us a box
that doesn't open.

07:34.242 --> 07:37.276
"This fertility box will keep
you company...

07:37.278 --> 07:39.345
"until I come to visit. See you
soon."

07:39.347 --> 07:40.646
She's coming to visit already?

07:40.648 --> 07:43.551
Shush. She's not here now.

07:45.151 --> 07:47.351
No, she's not.

behind closed doors.

Yes, ma'am. After you,
Mrs. Pierce, come on, come on.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.094

beautiful, and sexy.

Okay, fine.

put together the crib then.

complicated the problem...

Math, and life for that matter,
are very reliable in that way.

All you have to do is logically
work through the problem...

11:55.427 --> 11:57.392

have any idea why...

14:32.891 --> 14:36.860
the university offered me such
a good package to teach here?

14:36.862 --> 14:40.595
We have a shortage of qualified
math teachers.

scares off...

14:44.667 --> 14:48.169
some of the more qualified
academics.

14:48.171 --> 14:50.102
And the school still lets you
teach it?

14:50.104 --> 14:52.705
The students love it.

14:52.707 --> 14:56.409
Consequently, their parents'
checkbooks love it.

a lot lately.

Well, today it's your class,

Alright, then.

The university didn't give me a

52:08.668 --> 52:10.469
Somehow, I feel like this all...

52:10.471 --> 52:12.502
has to do with me losing
the baby.

52:12.504 --> 52:14.404
On a cellular level...

52:14.406 --> 52:16.707
yourself and the baby are still
connected.

52:16.709 --> 52:19.409
It doesn't matter whether you
miscarried or gave birth.

52:19.411 --> 52:21.677
In fact, there are recent
studies that show...

52:21.679 --> 52:23.680
that fetal cells from
a pregnancy...

52:23.682 --> 52:25.714
they stay with the mother
for the rest of her life.

52:25.716 --> 52:27.449
What do the cells do?

52:27.451 --> 52:30.550
Well, one theory is that since
they are foreign cells...

52:30.552 --> 52:34.322
they do harm to the mother,
which is why women...

52:34.324 --> 52:38.458
have higher rates of autoimmune
diseases such as lupus.

52:38.460 --> 52:39.826
Oh, that's comforting.

52:39.828 --> 52:41.861
But, there's another theory...

52:41.863 --> 52:44.897
one to which I personally
subscribe and that is...

52:44.899 --> 52:47.898
that the cells actually help
protect the mother...

52:47.900 --> 52:49.634
by assisting in the healing
process.

52:49.636 --> 52:51.770
That's why women live longer.

were not able to open this box...

but your wife could.

54:42.497 --> 54:43.629

You remember the reasons
you told me?

01:21:04.013 --> 01:21:11.083
'Cause you're loving, and kind,
and loyal, and nurturing.

01:21:11.085 --> 01:21:14.086
And protective.

01:21:14.088 --> 01:21:19.924
She's my daughter. I have to
take care of her and love her.

01:21:19.926 --> 01:21:21.058
And protect her.

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:22.727
It's not Lisa Jr.

01:21:22.729 --> 01:21:25.029
You're just jealous, because you
wanted a boy.

01:21:25.031 --> 01:21:27.997
You wanted an Adam Jr and you're
taking it out on our daughter.

01:21:27.999 --> 01:21:30.499
No, darlin', our baby's dead,
and something...

01:21:30.501 --> 01:21:36.070
something terrible took its
place. But we can beat it.

01:21:36.072 --> 01:21:36.971
By killing me?

01:21:36.973 --> 01:21:38.006
No.

01:21:38.008 --> 01:21:41.142
I won't let you hurt her.

01:21:41.144 --> 01:21:44.144
I won't let you hurt me.

Lisa...

01:23:36.207 --> 01:23:38.139
Adam.

01:23:38.141 --> 01:23:39.106
No.

01:23:39.108 --> 01:23:41.141
I'm so sorry...

01:23:41.143 --> 01:23:44.078
I didn't... I didn't know it was
you. I didn't mean to...

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.878
I know, it's okay.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.247
I'm going to get you out
of here. Come on.

01:23:48.249 --> 01:23:51.386
No, you have to finish this.

Please... do it for our real

I love you, too, professor.

01:24:31.485 --> 01:24:34.119
Don't do it, Daddy.

01:24:34.121 --> 01:24:36.391
Oh, God, forgive me.

(BUZZER BUZZING, DOOR OPENS)

01:25:18.992 --> 01:25:22.459
Dr. Clark, surprised to see
you here.

01:25:22.461 --> 01:25:24.227
Why's that?

01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:27.530
Because when I was sitting
exactly where you are now...

01:25:27.532 --> 01:25:29.966
James told me that nobody came
to visit him...

01:25:29.968 --> 01:25:34.168
after he killed his wife,
everyone thought he went crazy.

01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:35.369
Didn't he?

01:25:35.371 --> 01:25:37.706
Didn't I?

01:25:37.708 --> 01:25:39.440
They say that I killed Lisa...

01:25:39.442 --> 01:25:42.279
because I found her sleeping
with one of my students.

01:25:43.479 --> 01:25:45.513
They say I killed David.

01:25:45.515 --> 01:25:50.683
That would be a logical
and rational conclusion.

01:25:50.685 --> 01:25:53.985
You know, I tried talking
to the police, but even...

01:25:53.987 --> 01:25:56.187
in the country, superstition
is something that only...

01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:58.221
happens behind closed doors.

01:25:58.223 --> 01:26:00.224
You and I both know the truth.

01:26:00.226 --> 01:26:05.265
I know "a truth", but "the
truth"?

01:26:07.566 --> 01:26:12.434
Adam... why did you kill Lisa?

01:26:12.436 --> 01:26:15.304
Is it because James Harper
told you to?

01:26:15.306 --> 01:26:17.271
Mm-mm.

01:26:17.273 --> 01:26:22.543
It was the only way to save
her... and our little baby.

01:26:22.545 --> 01:26:25.611
And you really believe that?

01:26:25.613 --> 01:26:28.314
A wise person once said that
one plus one...

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:29.518
doesn't always equal two.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.590
What, what happened to the box,
Adam?

01:26:39.592 --> 01:26:43.995
The police couldn't find it, not
that they were looking for it.

01:26:43.997 --> 01:26:46.198
But we couldn't find it, either.

01:26:47.366 --> 01:26:50.766
I took care of it.

01:26:50.768 --> 01:26:53.504
I sent it back to where
it came from.
