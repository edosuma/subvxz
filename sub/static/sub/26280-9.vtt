00:03.090 --> 00:06.006
Sheldon, do you want to put
the tables after each section

00:06.136 --> 00:08.008
or in an appendix
at the end?

00:08.138 --> 00:10.314
You know what?
We wrote this paper together.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.099
I think we should
decide together

00:12.229 --> 00:15.493
that they go in an appendix
at the end.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.887
How about that?
There is an "I" in "team."

00:22.152 --> 00:24.850
Look at what we made.
I know.

00:24.981 --> 00:27.114
It really is the best
of both of us.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.899
It's got my math
and your sassy takedown

00:30.030 --> 00:31.509
of the fundamental nature
of symmetry.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.338
It's got my bottomless
intellectual curiosity

00:34.469 --> 00:36.166
and your petulant refusal

00:36.297 --> 00:39.082
to spell "gray" with an "a"
like an American.

00:39.213 --> 00:42.825
You realize we still have
a lot of work to do

00:42.955 --> 00:44.174
before we can publish.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.089
Perhaps we should
divide and conquer.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.657
Now, you track down
all the citations

00:48.787 --> 00:50.224
and properly note them
in our bibliography,

00:50.354 --> 00:52.356
and I will roll up
my sleeves

00:52.487 --> 00:54.880
and decide what font
we want to use.

00:55.011 --> 00:58.710
Sheldon, there are hundreds
of citations to track down.

00:58.841 --> 01:01.800
And thousands of fonts, but
you don't hear me complaining.

01:01.931 --> 01:04.890
I am not gonna
spend weeks

01:05.021 --> 01:07.067
in a library
looking up old papers.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.199
Can't we hire
a grad student to do it?

01:09.330 --> 01:10.505
Yeah, a grad student?

01:10.635 --> 01:12.376
I am not trusting
our unpublished paper

01:12.507 --> 01:13.595
to some millennial.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.075
They'll put unicorn emojis on it

01:15.205 --> 01:17.207
and then post it
on social media.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.122
Why would they do that?

01:19.253 --> 01:22.082
Economic anxiety, too much
avocado toast, who cares?

01:22.212 --> 01:26.347
Look, the point is, we can't
afford to have this paper leaked

01:26.477 --> 01:27.696
before we're ready to publish.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.350
That's how you kiss
the Nobel Prize good-bye

01:29.480 --> 01:31.700
instead of hello
as I intend to do.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.093
I assume you mean
metaphorically.

01:34.659 --> 01:35.356
Absolutely not. If the King
of Sweden hands me a medal,

01:36.748 --> 01:37.923
I intend to smear it with Purell
and then kiss it.

01:39.403 --> 01:40.839
But what if we ask one
of our friends to help us out?

01:40.970 --> 01:42.014
How about Leonard?

01:42.145 --> 01:45.540
Gee, I don't know.
Can we trust him?

01:45.670 --> 01:48.412
He's your best friend
in the whole world.

01:48.543 --> 01:49.848
Yes, but he's
always struck me

01:49.979 --> 01:51.415
as the guy in
the plane crash

01:51.546 --> 01:54.592
who doesn't wait until you're
all the way dead to eat you.

01:55.593 --> 01:58.118
I think
you can trust him.

01:58.248 --> 02:01.208
Oh, Amy, you never lose
that childlike innocence.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.343
Leonard, I need
to tell you something.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.476
I'm having an affair.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.003
Okay.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.267
You have to swear
not to tell anybody.

Okay.

who knows.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.534
Uh, well, you and Rita,
the cafeteria lady

02:23.665 --> 02:26.146
who has been giving me
more than Tater Tots.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.584
Hey, Sheldon.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.673
Not a word.

02:36.678 --> 02:38.462
What did he want?

02:38.593 --> 02:40.203
Oh, nothing. He just concocted
some stupid test

02:40.334 --> 02:41.857
to see if I can keep a secret.

02:41.987 --> 02:42.901
Ooh, what's
the secret?

02:45.600 --> 02:47.732
I'm not gonna tell you that.

02:47.863 --> 02:50.213

but I still want to pass.

never having an affair

No, no.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.260
Well, I am shocked,
Sheldon,

03:37.391 --> 03:39.480
because I totally believed
that the woman you reported

03:39.610 --> 03:42.134
for being stingy with the peas
couldn't keep her hands off you.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.877
Well, I am a little hurt

my husband was having an affair.
I thought we were friends.

03:48.402 --> 03:49.838
I didn't really believe him.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.057
Why not? You don't think
other women find him attractive?

03:52.188 --> 03:53.276
[laughing]:
No.

03:56.148 --> 03:59.326
I suppose you're wondering why
I put you through all this.

03:59.456 --> 04:02.242
You mean the last two minutes
or the last 20 years?

04:03.591 --> 04:05.593
We need to ask you
a big favor.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.552
Well, you've certainly
gone about it the right way.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.206
You know we're almost
finished with our paper;

04:10.337 --> 04:12.774
we just need help
tracking down the citations.

04:12.904 --> 04:16.038
That's busywork. Can't you just
get a grad student to do it?

04:16.168 --> 04:19.346
No, this paper is
incredibly important to us,

04:19.476 --> 04:20.956
and we need someone
we can trust.

mean a lot.

could be kind of fun.

It's kind of for gamers.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.287
Okay, okay, h-how about this?
We all tell him.

10:36.418 --> 10:37.767
Or even better: you tell him.

10:37.898 --> 10:41.510
Yeah, that makes the most sense.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.904
You guys are such cowards.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.906
Yes, we are.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.441
Hey, Denise. Is Stuart here?

10:59.571 --> 11:00.790
Oh, no. Doctor's appointment.

11:00.921 --> 11:01.922
Oh, is he okay?

11:02.052 --> 11:04.446
Not since I've known him.

11:04.576 --> 11:07.536
Which brings up
an interesting question.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.845
You and Stuart. Why?

11:11.975 --> 11:14.630
I don't know.
My parents owned a funeral home.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.501
Read into that what you will.

11:16.632 --> 11:19.113
What can I help you with?

11:19.243 --> 11:22.116
I was hoping Stuart could show
me how to play Fortnite.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.987
Mm, I can teach you.Really, you good?

11:24.118 --> 11:27.382
Look at my skin. I haven't been
outside in six years.

11:27.512 --> 11:28.818
So you'll coach me?

11:28.949 --> 11:31.168
Sure. Now let me ask
you a question.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.693
Howard. Why?

11:34.694 --> 11:37.348
You got eyes--
what do you think?

11:41.526 --> 11:43.572
[sighs]

11:43.703 --> 11:45.617
[groans]

11:48.751 --> 11:50.797
[mutters]

11:54.452 --> 11:57.194
[groans, mutters]

11:59.936 --> 12:02.069
[groans]

12:02.199 --> 12:04.375
Wow, I really wish
I didn't see this.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.508
Oh, hey.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.337
I just need to give Sheldon
some bad news,

12:09.467 --> 12:11.208
and I really don't want to.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.428
Oh, my God. Is everything okay?No, I-I found a paper

12:13.558 --> 12:15.430
that proves their theory wrong.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.432
They thought this was gonna
be their Nobel Prize.

12:17.562 --> 12:18.912
It's gonna break his heart.

12:19.042 --> 12:22.350
Oh, man. Maybe leave
an anonymous note, you know,

12:22.480 --> 12:24.352
like in high school,
when you want to let

12:24.482 --> 12:27.703
your best friend know that
her boyfriend's cheating on her.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.401
Why wouldn't
you just tell her that?

12:30.532 --> 12:33.274
I don't know.
Maybe you had a hickey.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.844
I-Isn't it better
to get bad news from a friend?

12:37.974 --> 12:39.193
Trust me, it's not.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.543
I went to prom
with a hickey and a black eye.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.807
Come on, knock on the door.
You can do this.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.809
All right, a-all right,
here I go.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.680
Oh, wait, just let me
get inside.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.334
Why?

12:50.465 --> 12:53.033
"Why"? Come on.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.905
[door closes]

12:57.951 --> 12:59.909
Oh, hey, Leonard.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.215
Is the podcast too loud?

13:01.345 --> 13:02.564
I didn't hear a podcast.

13:02.694 --> 13:06.524
I told you no one could hear it.

13:06.655 --> 13:09.353
Well, I heard Ira Glass,
so he's either in your earbuds

13:09.484 --> 13:11.921
or clinging to the ceiling
like a gecko.

13:14.315 --> 13:17.231
Actually, I-I need to talk to
both of you about your paper.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.059
Oh, right,
how are the citations coming?

13:19.189 --> 13:20.582
Well, Raj and I were
chasing them down

13:20.712 --> 13:23.628
like you asked us to, and, um,

13:23.759 --> 13:24.978
we came a-across a,

13:26.501 --> 13:29.417
a Russian paper that seems
to disprove super-asymmetry.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.767
Are you sure?

13:31.898 --> 13:34.901
Yeah, uh, Howard translated it.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.339
I'm so sorry.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.605
Sheldon,
are you, are you all right?

13:43.735 --> 13:45.868
Oh, yes, of course.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.870
Thank you for telling us,
Leonard.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.045
I'm sure that wasn't easy.

13:51.308 --> 13:53.267
I guess we don't need
this anymore.

13:53.397 --> 13:56.052
[sighs]

14:05.845 --> 14:07.847
[screams]

14:12.373 --> 14:16.986
So what are you listening to,
This American Life?

14:19.815 --> 14:22.383
Okay, so walk up to
that chest and push X.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.515
X. Push X.

14:24.646 --> 14:25.690
Which one's X?

14:25.821 --> 14:28.824
The one with the X on it.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.347
Take it easy,
I'm new at this.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.697
What, the alphabet?

14:32.828 --> 14:34.917
You don't have to be snarky.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.136
Hey, do you want
to play the game,

14:36.266 --> 14:37.441
or do you want to crawl back up

14:37.572 --> 14:40.488
your mommy's shirt
and chow down like a baby?

14:40.618 --> 14:42.925
Damn, what is wrong with you?

14:43.056 --> 14:44.840
I'm sorry, I thought you
wanted to beat your husband.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.537
I do.Well, then suck it up!

14:46.668 --> 14:48.191
Okay!

14:50.715 --> 14:52.717
[knocking on door]

14:55.111 --> 14:57.374
Hi.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.898
Can I do anything?

14:59.028 --> 15:01.683
No.

15:01.813 --> 15:04.338
I can make you some tea,
I-I could sing "Soft Kitty."

15:04.468 --> 15:06.688
I don't understand how
you're not more upset by this.

15:06.818 --> 15:07.863
This is your paper, too.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.866
I am upset, Sheldon.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.869
I'm just trying to hold
it together for you.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.265
Like when that goose wouldn't
leave us alone at brunch.

15:18.395 --> 15:19.875
That thing scared you, too?

15:20.006 --> 15:24.880
Well, of course it did.
I was wearing a down jacket.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.361
Well, I don't need you
to pretend to be okay for me.

15:27.491 --> 15:28.623
If anything,
that makes it worse.

15:28.753 --> 15:33.236
Fine. I'm not okay.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.456
We came up with this idea
at our wedding.

15:35.586 --> 15:38.459
We poured months
of our lives into it.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.635
I thought we were changing
the course of science,

15:40.765 --> 15:44.030
and now it's all gone.
I'm devastated.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.337
I was wrong,
that makes it worse.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.556
Go back to being happy.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.170
[gunfire over computer]

15:56.216 --> 15:57.391
Hey, guys.

15:57.521 --> 15:58.958
Hey.
Hey.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.221
You, uh, playing that,
what's it called again?

16:01.351 --> 16:03.788
Fortnow?

16:03.919 --> 16:05.616
Fortnite.Right.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.010
I guess I forgot 'cause I only
played it that one time

16:08.141 --> 16:11.579
and I was so bad at it.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.929
Don't beat yourself up.
It's a hard game.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.062
Would you mind if I gave it
another shot?

16:16.192 --> 16:17.628
Mm, maybe later, Berna...

16:17.759 --> 16:20.283
Give me.

16:20.414 --> 16:23.678
Where are you, Howard,
where are you?

16:23.808 --> 16:27.595
Let me just build a little ramp,
get some height.

16:27.725 --> 16:31.773
You want to press B to go into
build-- oh, you already did it.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.167
Did I? I'm just hitting buttons.

16:34.297 --> 16:35.516
Wee!

16:37.648 --> 16:39.781
I see your ramp.
I'm coming for you.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.826
You can try, but...[explosion sound effect]

16:41.957 --> 16:43.263
Gotcha.
[chuckles]

16:43.393 --> 16:47.441
Son of a bitch.

16:47.571 --> 16:48.703
Want to play again?

16:48.833 --> 16:49.965
No!

16:52.141 --> 16:53.969
Howard.What?

16:54.100 --> 16:56.493
I make more money than you.

16:59.714 --> 17:02.760
You got yourself
a good one there, buddy.

17:05.676 --> 17:08.114
So neither of them
showed up for work today?

17:08.244 --> 17:09.680
No, I tried calling
and no one picked up.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.117
Look, I'm sure
they're fine.

17:12.727 --> 17:13.119
They were probably up all night
coming up with a new theory.

17:14.511 --> 17:16.035
I-I also texted to see
if he wanted to go to the new

17:16.165 --> 17:18.602
Fantastic Beastsmovie
and he didn't respond.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.083
All right, well, they're already
dead. There's nothing we can do.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.830
SHELDON:
Come in.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.228
PENNY:
Hey...

17:35.358 --> 17:39.101
You guys look all comfy.
Did-did you take the day off?

17:39.232 --> 17:41.495
It's Saturday.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.671
No, it's not.

17:43.801 --> 17:47.501
Great, another thing
we're wrong about.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.331
How many does
that make, Amy?

17:51.461 --> 17:54.769
Two.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.597
Two things.

17:56.727 --> 17:59.513
What happened to us?

17:59.643 --> 18:01.689
I'll tell you what happened.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.692
Professor Gregoropovich.

18:04.822 --> 18:07.347
I-I think it's
Gregora-poli-popivich, but...

18:13.831 --> 18:16.051
Three.

18:16.182 --> 18:20.055
Look, you guys, you had a,
you had a setback, you know?

18:20.186 --> 18:22.666
This is the time you got to
dig in and-and try harder.

18:22.797 --> 18:25.582
It's like halftime
and you're down by seven.

18:26.714 --> 18:27.889
What are you doing?

18:28.019 --> 18:29.064
All right,
it's-it's like

18:29.195 --> 18:31.675
Bat-halftime and you're down
by Bat-seven.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.722
Let me try.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.333
You-you guys can't just give up.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.248
Uh, individually, you are
the smartest people I know.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.729
Together, you can do anything.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.774
I appreciate what you're trying
to do but please stop.

18:43.905 --> 18:46.081
You can't make this better.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.083
All right, Amy, listen...I'm with Sheldon.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.780
We worked our butts off
on this paper

18:49.911 --> 18:51.347
and it was all for nothing.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.567
And if you think
some pep talk can fix that,

18:53.697 --> 18:56.918
then you don't understand
how much this meant to us.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.224
Is there anything we can do?

18:58.354 --> 19:00.139
No.

19:00.269 --> 19:01.749
Yeah-- wait.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.620
Do I smell Siam Palace?

19:03.751 --> 19:06.145
Oh, yeah, it's our dinner.

19:10.801 --> 19:13.326
I mean, it's yourdinner.

19:13.456 --> 19:16.111
Any mango sticky rice?

19:16.242 --> 19:17.243
PENNY:
No.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.723
And the blows keep coming.

19:26.774 --> 19:29.429
I see you. I see you...

19:29.559 --> 19:30.952
and boom.[explosion sound effect]

19:31.082 --> 19:33.955
Gotcha! How's it feel, Penny?

19:34.085 --> 19:37.306
Like I don't care at all.

19:37.437 --> 19:40.048
Wrong, it feels bad because
you lost and I won.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.181
Whoo! What a rush!

19:42.311 --> 19:44.487
All right, can we go eat now?

19:44.618 --> 19:45.532
Hell yeah.All right.

19:45.662 --> 19:46.750
Hey, how's it going?

19:46.881 --> 19:49.405
Boom!

19:50.711 --> 19:53.801
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna drive.
