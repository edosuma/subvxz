00:04.772 --> 00:06.628
<i>Do you believe in the existence of evil?</i>

00:06.698 --> 00:07.942
Help me!

00:08.042 --> 00:09.644
- Oh.
- No!

00:11.813 --> 00:14.682
<i>30 years ago, I found
the Book of the Dead.</i>

00:14.782 --> 00:17.051
<i>Now, because I read from the book...</i>

00:17.151 --> 00:18.620
Missar-drah...

00:18.720 --> 00:20.388
<i>...evil has found me.</i>

00:22.624 --> 00:24.459
You have no idea what you're doing!

00:24.559 --> 00:26.428
Of course I know what I'm doing.

00:26.528 --> 00:28.763
I wrote this book.

00:31.666 --> 00:33.401
Ruby is in Elk Grove, Michigan.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.836
That's my hometown.

00:34.936 --> 00:36.804
Ash?

00:36.904 --> 00:38.406
Hiya Pop.

00:38.506 --> 00:42.410
I got a problem.
The book... it did something to me.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.811
It changed me.

00:43.911 --> 00:44.979
Night night.

00:47.157 --> 00:48.623
That's our cue!

00:53.020 --> 00:56.591
Evil, if you show your ugly mug
in this town ever again,

00:56.655 --> 01:00.742
I will take you down
and I will wipe you out!

01:04.397 --> 01:06.601
You know me as Ash Williams,

01:06.701 --> 01:09.937
the hero who saved Elk Grove from evil.

01:10.037 --> 01:13.641
For 30 long years, I've used
this saw on monsters and demons.

01:13.741 --> 01:17.044
But those battles are won,
so now I use it to...

01:18.345 --> 01:20.582
Slash prices!

01:22.116 --> 01:24.886
At Ashy Slashy's Hardware
Store Emporium,

01:24.986 --> 01:27.311
we got you covered!

01:28.189 --> 01:30.091
You want paint?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.226
We shake it till we break it!

01:37.298 --> 01:40.264
Ladies, you'll love his nuts!

01:41.603 --> 01:43.686
What's better than a handful of my nuts?

01:43.741 --> 01:45.264
Ahh!

01:45.339 --> 01:46.407
A long screw.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.309
Whoa!

01:48.409 --> 01:49.611
We got wood.

01:49.711 --> 01:50.845
We got rope.

01:50.945 --> 01:53.047
We got rubber! We got it all!

01:53.748 --> 01:55.316
Die high prices!

01:56.718 --> 01:57.985
Goodbye high prices!

01:59.153 --> 02:01.623
For that special someone,
we've got everything from

02:01.723 --> 02:03.658
- "D" to "ildo."
- Mmm.

02:03.758 --> 02:06.761
Because at Ashy Slashy's,
service is literally...

02:06.861 --> 02:08.996
- Not.
- ...our middle name!

02:09.096 --> 02:10.231
Whoo!

02:13.635 --> 02:16.638
Perfection! And only 22 takes!

02:16.738 --> 02:18.439
<i>- Welcome back...</i>
- Yeah.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.774
It's looking good, Jefe.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.976
Marketing 101, Pablo.

02:22.076 --> 02:24.545
Know your audience.

02:24.646 --> 02:26.480
Look at them lining up out there.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.315
You're a badass!

02:28.415 --> 02:30.652
You know I've never
seen a town lose its shit

02:30.752 --> 02:32.754
over a hardware store before.

02:32.854 --> 02:33.931
Well, it's time to wake up and smell

02:33.955 --> 02:36.423
the lightly scented wax flowers, Pablo.

02:36.523 --> 02:39.794
This isn't just a well-stocked
hardware store/sex-toy emporium.

02:39.894 --> 02:42.596
No, this is a shrine to a local hero.

02:42.697 --> 02:44.666
Those adoring fans are my peeps!

02:52.640 --> 02:54.876
All right!

02:54.976 --> 02:57.244
Hey, hey!

02:57.344 --> 03:00.748
- Hello, Elk Grove!
- Hey, hey!

03:00.848 --> 03:04.595
Are you ready for some hardware?!

03:04.819 --> 03:06.478
Come on in!

03:08.022 --> 03:10.658
Fishing supplies, aisle two.

03:10.758 --> 03:14.361
We got guns, we got flags,
we got pornography.

03:14.796 --> 03:16.363
That's a little further in the back.

03:17.431 --> 03:18.933
Men, can't please your wives?

03:19.033 --> 03:20.634
Better check out aisle seven.

03:20.735 --> 03:21.735
Yeah!

03:21.803 --> 03:24.238
- Same problem?
- No need to push, jeez.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.406
Aisle 3 I think.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.675
Hey, no need to push. Leave me alone.

03:28.743 --> 03:31.779
And last up we have Amy,

03:31.879 --> 03:35.582
who I'm told has made
a startling discovery.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.540
I see here, Amy, that
you discovered this item...

03:38.602 --> 03:39.687
In the mud.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.488
In the mud.

03:48.162 --> 03:49.797
Well, I know. I'm sorry...

03:53.534 --> 03:54.694
What I fucking tell you, huh?

03:54.769 --> 03:56.270
How many times I got to tell you?

03:56.370 --> 03:59.206
Pretzels are for paying customers only!

03:59.306 --> 04:00.341
Okay?

04:00.441 --> 04:03.878
Next time I'll use your
head as a fucking cue ball.

04:03.978 --> 04:06.647
Who touched the T... who touched the TV?

04:06.748 --> 04:08.682
How many fuckin'...

04:21.728 --> 04:23.831
Hey, hey, it's me.

04:25.666 --> 04:29.303
You were right, evil's coming back.

04:29.403 --> 04:32.706
And here you've found a book
written in ancient Sumerian.

04:35.209 --> 04:38.612
- Curious.
- Does "curious" mean valuable?

04:38.712 --> 04:40.314
This appears to be some sort of...

04:40.414 --> 04:43.050
descriptive passage.

04:43.150 --> 04:46.120
Conda anu astratta alaktu...

04:46.220 --> 04:47.620
You know with most of these clowns,

04:47.688 --> 04:49.623
I got to play hardball, but for you?

04:49.723 --> 04:51.625
Hose clamps are half-off.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.027
These are the best in the world.

04:53.127 --> 04:55.462
You put them on, they grip tight.

04:55.562 --> 04:58.933
They don't slip, slide, stretch,
or tear like other things.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.734
<i>...estaro ces reche.</i>

05:00.835 --> 05:03.537
Sarr des kanda...

05:05.372 --> 05:06.740
Kanda...

05:09.376 --> 05:10.477
kanda?

05:14.281 --> 05:15.582
What?

05:15.682 --> 05:18.219
Apparently you've found an ancient text,

05:18.319 --> 05:22.556
known as the Necronomicon-Ex Mortis.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.759
The Book of the Dead.

05:25.860 --> 05:26.861
Is that... good?

05:26.961 --> 05:30.832
The book, is said to hold spells

05:30.932 --> 05:33.767
and incantations that,

05:33.868 --> 05:35.623
if read out loud...

05:37.004 --> 05:40.141
...could connect the demons
of the netherworld,

05:40.241 --> 05:41.542
with our own...

05:54.155 --> 05:55.990
Most important thing about a hose,

05:56.090 --> 05:57.724
is its width, and its length.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.560
Mostly the length.

06:00.962 --> 06:03.397
<i>Our scheduled broadcast
will resume in a moment.</i>

06:03.497 --> 06:05.399
Hey!

06:05.499 --> 06:07.434
I paid for two more spots!

06:07.534 --> 06:09.536
Okay, we got two fish tacos.

06:09.636 --> 06:10.537
Bam!

06:10.637 --> 06:12.089
We got your hard drive.

06:12.114 --> 06:13.280
- That's me. Thank you.
- Enjoy.

06:13.304 --> 06:15.150
- Oh yeah.
- Oh!

06:17.111 --> 06:18.779
I don't know...

06:18.880 --> 06:20.147
Excuse me.

06:20.882 --> 06:24.018
Oh! Shit...

06:50.259 --> 06:51.670
Who are you?

06:51.710 --> 06:54.982
Well in Rome, they called me
<i>mulier daemonium de igne</i>.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.483
Demon woman of fire.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.995
And in Greece, they called me

06:59.042 --> 07:02.389
<i>ágria ti mitéra apó tin kólasi.</i>

07:02.489 --> 07:04.491
Fierce mother from hell.

07:04.591 --> 07:08.462
But in these benighted times,
they just call me Ruby.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.764
I'll take that.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.296
No! No! Wait! It's too important...

07:18.705 --> 07:20.641
This is bullshit.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.276
Whatever happened to free speech?

07:22.376 --> 07:25.123
Ah, this was my best giant penis yet.

07:25.201 --> 07:26.662
Yeah.

07:26.709 --> 07:28.381
Thanks for talking me into this.

07:28.433 --> 07:29.667
You missed a spot.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.552
- Dick.
- Less.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.528
Can we just finish and get out?

07:35.622 --> 07:37.424
I'm in enough trouble already.

07:37.524 --> 07:40.361
Wait till they see what
I drew on Perkins' car.

07:40.461 --> 07:44.154
Is "man-gina" a word?

07:45.199 --> 07:47.401
Oh, Rachel, please.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.346
I just want to get through
the next four months.

07:49.370 --> 07:51.872
Since when did you become
Miss Bourgeoisie?

07:51.973 --> 07:53.607
Oh, it's simple.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.409
I graduate, I can leave here.

07:55.509 --> 07:59.947
I leave here, I'm not here,
and that's a good thing.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.558
All right, you still haven't
fallen for Elk Grove's

08:01.582 --> 08:03.350
"small town charms?"

08:03.450 --> 08:05.252
Excuse me?

08:05.352 --> 08:07.554
The whole town's excited
because their ex-psycho killer

08:07.654 --> 08:09.890
is opening a hardware store.

08:09.991 --> 08:12.726
Kill me now.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.328
Could be worse.

08:14.428 --> 08:15.428
How?

08:15.496 --> 08:17.398
We could be like them.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.002
Oh, yeah. That'll never happen.

08:21.102 --> 08:23.637
Good, because if you did,

08:23.737 --> 08:24.977
I would have to slit my wrists.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.849
Oh, look. Cougie's back.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.816
Yeah, well, fuck off, Cougie!

08:46.027 --> 08:48.529
Okay, we get it.

08:48.629 --> 08:52.073
Costume, mascot, very funny.

08:55.754 --> 08:57.088
You can leave now!

08:59.773 --> 09:01.408
Hey, asshole!

09:01.508 --> 09:03.244
Go away...

09:04.478 --> 09:05.479
Shit.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.682
Shit.

09:11.589 --> 09:14.091
Okay, guy, now I'm mad.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.333
Jesus, what is that?

09:28.535 --> 09:30.587
Probably just some varsity assholes

09:30.615 --> 09:32.484
playing some bullshit prank!

09:37.078 --> 09:39.180
Brandy, don't!

09:39.280 --> 09:41.512
What is your problem, fuckboy?

10:43.218 --> 10:44.770
Help!

10:45.779 --> 10:48.849
Help! Help please!

10:53.019 --> 10:54.855
And that's the whole story.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.923
- Hey, feller. How are you?
- Hey.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.859
Ladies. Come on.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.249
A litlle somethin', somethin'.

11:00.338 --> 11:01.640
There we go.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.465
Nickel for a tickle, huh?

11:04.565 --> 11:06.533
What do you say?

11:09.670 --> 11:13.174
I don't believe this, it's really him.

11:15.378 --> 11:17.195
- Oh, hey. Hey, honey.
<i>- Mom! Mom!</i>

11:17.242 --> 11:18.585
<i>There's this guy at the school,
you've got to come</i>

11:18.609 --> 11:19.709
- <i>help us, please!</i>
- What?

11:19.733 --> 11:21.088
- Hey, Pablo.
- Yeah.

11:21.182 --> 11:23.703
Ah, I got to talk to you about
something else.

11:23.781 --> 11:25.219
If this is about a raise...

11:25.319 --> 11:27.264
Actually, you don't pay me
at all right now, but...

11:27.288 --> 11:29.156
Son of a bitch!

11:29.256 --> 11:30.691
Hey, whoa!

11:30.791 --> 11:32.526
Lady! There's a line!

11:32.626 --> 11:35.529
Wha...? You don't even remember me?

11:35.629 --> 11:37.564
Well, the old steel trap
never forgets a rack,

11:37.664 --> 11:40.701
but faces are a little fuzzy.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.569
Give me a hint.

11:45.071 --> 11:46.673
I said a hint.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.083
I'm your fucking wife!

11:50.060 --> 11:51.395
My what?

11:51.496 --> 11:52.897
We need to talk.

11:58.168 --> 11:59.937
Lady, I don't know what
kind of coo-coo juice

12:00.037 --> 12:02.048
you've been drinkin',
but if you're fishing for alimony...

12:02.072 --> 12:04.652
One of your goddamn monsters
just attacked

12:04.714 --> 12:06.276
our daughter at Kenward County High.

12:06.376 --> 12:07.612
Daughter?! Ha!

12:07.712 --> 12:09.780
You definitely got the wrong guy!

12:09.880 --> 12:11.516
Demons made you chop off your hand.

12:11.616 --> 12:13.417
"I'll swallow your soul."

12:13.518 --> 12:15.920
Good sex is 30 seconds
followed by a cheeseburger?

12:18.489 --> 12:20.825
Okay, maybe we have met.

12:20.925 --> 12:22.035
But in case you didn't get the memo,

12:22.059 --> 12:24.829
me and my compadres,
we buried evil big time.

12:24.929 --> 12:27.431
Elk Grove is officially
a demon-free zone.

12:27.532 --> 12:29.233
- Jefe.
- Yeah.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.768
I think she's telling the truth.

12:37.942 --> 12:40.611
Dude, I told you to get that
shit lasered off.

12:40.711 --> 12:42.613
Nah, I didn't do this!

12:42.713 --> 12:43.981
It just happened outside.

12:44.081 --> 12:45.482
I'm scared!

12:45.583 --> 12:47.685
This thing is after
my little girl and...

12:47.785 --> 12:49.887
All right all ready! I'll check it out!

13:04.902 --> 13:06.771
Just like old times, eh, Pablo?

13:06.871 --> 13:09.073
Except for the wife part, and no Kelly.

13:09.173 --> 13:10.841
Actually, it's not like
old times at all.

13:10.941 --> 13:13.711
- Just drive!
- Hey, easy for you sister.

13:13.811 --> 13:15.445
You come waltzing into my life,

13:15.546 --> 13:17.347
yapping about demons and daughters,

13:17.447 --> 13:19.349
and I don't know boo about you.

13:19.449 --> 13:22.019
- Candace Barr.
- Yeah, and?

13:23.988 --> 13:25.455
Branson?

13:25.556 --> 13:26.924
Branson.

13:27.491 --> 13:30.394
Oh...

13:30.494 --> 13:32.830
♪ I want candy ♪

13:35.299 --> 13:37.367
♪ I want candy ♪

13:37.410 --> 13:38.410

13:53.792 --> 13:58.030
Wait a minute, Candace Barr.

13:59.659 --> 14:01.872
Oh no, Candy Barr?

14:05.455 --> 14:06.571
Well, this daughter of ours,

14:06.595 --> 14:08.664
I'll bet she thinks
I'm pretty special, huh?

14:08.764 --> 14:09.931
Dream on.

14:10.032 --> 14:11.676
I told her her old man
was some crack dealer

14:11.700 --> 14:13.769
- who got shanked in prison.
- What?!

14:13.869 --> 14:15.229
Well, it was easier than admitting

14:15.271 --> 14:18.207
I'd hooked up with some psycho saw-boy!

14:18.307 --> 14:21.643
Oh, okay, but I call
B.S. on the daughter.

14:21.743 --> 14:23.779
I was using my lucky rubber
all through the odds,

14:23.879 --> 14:26.315
and that sucker went 50 and 0.

16:40.115 --> 16:41.450
She's not answering.

16:42.184 --> 16:43.619
You actually went to school?

16:43.719 --> 16:46.322
Yeah, these halls have
some sweet memories.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.623
Met my first Linda here.

16:51.026 --> 16:54.062
Hey, give me a second.

16:54.162 --> 16:55.831
What are you doing?

16:57.299 --> 16:59.201
I'm sorry, I don't even know you,

16:59.301 --> 17:01.237
but did I make a mistake
coming to Ash for help?

17:05.507 --> 17:06.851
Ever since I hooked up with El Jefe,

17:06.875 --> 17:09.674
I've seen a lot of weird shit go down.

17:09.730 --> 17:11.598
But he's always had my back.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.115
Well, almost always.

17:14.215 --> 17:15.884
There was this one time
I got cut in half.

17:15.983 --> 17:17.117
What?

17:17.219 --> 17:19.588
Yeah, but Ash went back
in time to save me.

17:19.688 --> 17:22.424
It was so cool, but also really weird,

17:22.523 --> 17:25.193
because when we got back,
nothing seemed to have changed.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.096
Maui Wowie.

17:28.195 --> 17:30.466
It's my emergency stash.

17:30.566 --> 17:32.868
I'll just put this bad boy away
for the appropriate time.

Brandy?

18:35.764 --> 18:38.867
- Wow.
- She's not yours, dumb-ass!

18:38.967 --> 18:40.436
Mom!

18:40.536 --> 18:42.571
Honey! Thank God!

18:42.662 --> 18:43.813
- Back off, Mama Bear!
- Hey!

18:43.872 --> 18:45.106
What are you doing?

18:45.206 --> 18:46.842
The ink on my buddy went nuclear,

18:46.942 --> 18:49.678
that means evil is just
around the corner.

18:49.778 --> 18:53.415
So your little peach could
be a bowel-sucking hell beast.

18:53.515 --> 18:55.651

geek doing here?

18:55.751 --> 18:58.153
Oh, honey, uh, I don't know
how to tell you this,

but Ash, he's-he's ah-he's your...

19:00.756 --> 19:02.800

19:03.237 --> 19:04.612
I'm your pop.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.294
Father dearest.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.364
The old sperm shooter.

19:08.464 --> 19:10.098
- What?
- But you can call me Dad,

19:10.198 --> 19:12.501
unless you're a Deadite,
then you can go fuck yourself.

19:12.601 --> 19:13.902
So come on now, demon-spawn!

19:14.002 --> 19:15.371

25:48.997 --> 25:50.665

25:50.766 --> 25:52.600
