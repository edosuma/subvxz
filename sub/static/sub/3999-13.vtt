WEBVTT

00:19.519 --> 00:21.587
What in the hell is
around your neck?

00:21.589 --> 00:22.955
This? It's a
crystal charm, man.

00:22.957 --> 00:24.690
Yeah, the guys at
work gave it to me.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.859
Why?
- Technically,
it's "hazing,"

00:26.861 --> 00:28.427
but, uh, I
secretly love it.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.462
That is the kind of crystal
that should only rest

00:30.464 --> 00:32.398
between a set
of old bosoms.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.932
(yawps)

00:33.934 --> 00:35.534
Did that sound just
come from your body?
- (yawps)

00:35.536 --> 00:37.469
Hey!
- Ha!

00:37.471 --> 00:39.138
Whoa, how long
you two been here?

00:39.140 --> 00:41.140
When was the last time
you asked me that?
Last Thursday.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.307
So, at least Thursday.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.376
What kind of lazy...
(yawps) holes...

00:44.378 --> 00:46.812
Don't you know what
(yawps)-ing day it is?

00:46.814 --> 00:48.814
For crying out
l... (yawps)

00:48.816 --> 00:50.449
Glen, you should
see a doctor.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.784
My name is Schmidt.

00:51.786 --> 00:54.420
I can't afford
to miss work.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.922
I'm sorry, Glen,
but I'm with Kai on this one.

00:56.924 --> 00:57.956
Thanks, Wilfred.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.591
You ain't good with names.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.759
Oh, honey, you're
all turned around.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.394
No, you are.
- I think you are.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.229
(giggles)
Stop.
- I think you are.
I'm gonna get you...

01:04.231 --> 01:07.132
I've done some research.
Oh, ooh, how about
a head's up, man?

01:07.134 --> 01:09.168
Have I seen
those glasses before?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.803
I feel like I want
to remember them.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.438
I got these in seventh grade,
and I love them.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.505
Stop asking questions.

01:13.507 --> 01:14.807
All right,
check it.

01:14.809 --> 01:16.408
So nerd Coach went
to the library,

01:16.410 --> 01:17.810
and some place
that actually exists

01:17.812 --> 01:19.311
called the Hall of Documents.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.679
The downtown branch?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.281
How's Kathleen's eye?
Oh, Kathleen's dead.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.782
What?
- Yeah.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.151
So, check it out, guys,
this is all research.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.687
You two don't have to date
in secret anymore at school.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.789
Yeah, it's all here in
the<i> Lipinski v.</i>

01:30.791 --> 01:32.858
<i>Platte County</i>
<i>Unified School District.</i>

01:32.860 --> 01:34.927
Precedence for days!

01:34.929 --> 01:37.262
Wow. Wow, you did this for us.
No.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.798
I just want to pat it.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.167
I just want to, like,
frickin' pat it.

01:42.169 --> 01:43.936
I want to nurse it.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.504
Yeah, I want to provide it

01:45.506 --> 01:47.506
with milk.
- Huh.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.174
I used to be
the hot teacher.

01:49.176 --> 01:53.011
Now you know how I felt
when you turned up.

01:53.013 --> 01:56.215
A miserable path
awaits you.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.150
So you want us
to come out,

01:58.152 --> 02:00.152
so that you can go back
to hooking up

02:00.154 --> 02:01.353
with all the hot teachers?

02:01.355 --> 02:02.621
Very much so.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.056
But I'm thinking
about you guys, too.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.524
I mean, wouldn't it be better

02:05.526 --> 02:07.526
if you didn't have to hide
your relationship?

02:08.795 --> 02:11.363
Yeah, you know what?

02:11.365 --> 02:13.198
I think
we should do this.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.967
I... we should do this,
let's stop hiding.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.635
Yeah.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.337
But, Jess, will this make
things tricky for your work

02:18.339 --> 02:19.872
and will it in turn make you
distracted and preoccupied

02:19.874 --> 02:21.907
during our
splishy-splashy?
Ugh.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.909
No, no, of course not.
I won't let it.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.177
Then let's do this.

02:25.179 --> 02:26.678
Yeah, let's.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.647
Yes! We are coming out!

02:28.649 --> 02:30.415
Cracking. I'm chuffed.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.284
Dude, I do not get you.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.093
I trust you, Miss Day.

02:41.095 --> 02:44.563
Mostly because
I do not want to read this.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.532
That's great!
- (laughs)
Well,

02:46.534 --> 02:48.700
Yay!
- I'm the easy
one, dawg.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.937
Seriously, it's the teachers
you need to worry about.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.272
Especially you.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.507
You tend to care
what people think about you.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.710
(chuckles) That's like saying
a penguin "tends" to be cute.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.612
It's all it does, bro.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.681
(chuckles)
- So, good luck

03:02.683 --> 03:05.050
when the teachers present
their field trip proposals.

03:05.052 --> 03:08.387
If they catch a whiff
of favoritism,

03:08.389 --> 03:12.024
they are going
to tear you apart like...

03:12.026 --> 03:15.027
like a beautiful baguette,
you know what I mean?

03:15.029 --> 03:17.029
When you-you're
having dinner,

03:17.031 --> 03:20.032
and you just suddenly say,
"Hey, forget the bread knife.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.901
Let's just rip into this
with our bare hands."

03:22.903 --> 03:26.438
Ah, I love that.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.407
Hey, what'd they say?
What do you got?

03:28.409 --> 03:31.143
You can tell me,
I can take it.

03:31.145 --> 03:34.413
I-I don't know
if I can take it if...

03:34.415 --> 03:36.415
If you died, I'd be lost.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.917
J-Just tell me, I'll be there
for you, I'm big and strong.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.319
Is it cancer?
What's your problem?

03:40.321 --> 03:42.120
Oh, Schmidty,
you have cancer?

03:42.122 --> 03:43.555
I can't watch you go

03:43.557 --> 03:45.123
through cancer, buddy,
you're not strong enough.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.158
What is wrong with you?!

03:46.160 --> 03:47.326
Your friend
keeps forgetting

03:47.328 --> 03:48.560
his ulcer medication.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.928
Ulcer medication?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.463
He's lying, please.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.098
Take him home, make sure
he does nothing all day.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.733
Look, I'm not doing
nothing all day.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.935
Can't take
days off wor...

03:56.937 --> 03:59.838
My firm is wooing red potatoes,
and I want that account.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.907
Don't listen to that
aggressive male nurse.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.443
Wearing the same shoes
as an old Russian woman.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.612
It's not an ulcer,
he's ly... (yawps)

04:06.614 --> 04:09.748
Yeah, that's your ulcer telling
you to stop being a dick.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.583
(groans)

04:11.585 --> 04:13.252
Before we begin
our presentations,

04:13.254 --> 04:17.623
in the spirit of full disclosure
and transparency,

04:17.625 --> 04:19.491
I have something to tell you.

04:20.460 --> 04:23.262
Mr. Geauxinue and I are dating.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.930
No, n-n-n-no.
- (laughs)

04:24.932 --> 04:26.765
No, I just felt someone
pass over my grave.
- Right.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.833
I don't see a ring.

04:27.835 --> 04:28.867
This is a total joke.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.269
Oh, you're joking.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.637
There's none scenarios
that this is possible.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.505
COACH: Ladies, I
know you're upset,

04:33.507 --> 04:35.107
but you know what I do
when I'm upset?

04:35.109 --> 04:36.141
I hook up with me.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.943
But I want to assure you

04:37.945 --> 04:40.679
that this will not affect
my judgment as vice principal.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.781
Let's hear
those field trip proposals!

04:42.783 --> 04:45.017
Where are we gonna
take those kids, guys?!

04:45.019 --> 04:47.052
And you know what makes
the water delicious?

04:47.054 --> 04:49.054
Taking the poop out.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.623
Hello, water treatment plant.

04:52.659 --> 04:55.227
Okay, we're off
to a rocky start.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.662
They've got frickin' mini-golf.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.163
They've got frickin' Skee-Ball.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.232
They've got frickin'
bumper boats.

05:00.234 --> 05:02.634
They've got frickin' go-carts.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.469
Is this you topless
in the brochure?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.805
It is, thank you.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.408
Take a trip
to historical Coach-town.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.377
Lunch will be provided.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.813
I don't eat yesterday's bread.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.648
Yes, you do.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.749
Is there a field trip
in here somewhere?

05:17.751 --> 05:19.184
I want to take the children

05:19.186 --> 05:21.253
on an interactive
nature "experience."

05:21.255 --> 05:22.821
Very hands-on.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.389
With, uh,

05:24.391 --> 05:25.724
"foll-ahge..."

05:25.726 --> 05:27.359
"foil-iag-ee..."

05:27.361 --> 05:29.661
Not bad.
Um, I'd be a lot more into it

05:29.663 --> 05:31.596
if you could pronounce
"foliage."

05:31.598 --> 05:33.198
I messed it up!

05:33.200 --> 05:34.700
I can't do anything!

05:34.702 --> 05:36.401
So I've arranged
for our students to speak

05:36.403 --> 05:37.736
to astronauts
at the space station,

05:37.738 --> 05:38.937
uh, via Russian translator.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.407
And, as an added
surprise,

05:42.409 --> 05:44.176
actually get to operate
the Mars rover.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.677
You see, this is

05:45.679 --> 05:49.348
"Mission to Mars:
Field Trip to Another World."

05:51.584 --> 05:52.718
JESS:
Okay, then.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.019
(toy engine revs)

05:54.021 --> 05:56.121
Well, you all had
great presentations,

05:56.123 --> 05:59.191
but I'm sure no one can
accuse me of favoritism

05:59.193 --> 06:00.692
when I choose Mr. G's proposal,

06:00.694 --> 06:03.895
which was so, so, so clearly
the best one.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.797
(booing)
RUTH: What does space have?

06:05.799 --> 06:07.632
You can't even walk
on the ground.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.768
You obviously picked it because
he's your frickin' boyfriend.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.570
Well...
BIOLOGY TEACHER:
I see how it is.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.106
My butt isn't cute enough.
Should I call my ma

06:14.108 --> 06:16.875
and blame her for passing
on her wide flat ass?

06:16.877 --> 06:19.277
(imitates dialing phone)

06:19.279 --> 06:21.446
Hello, Ma?

06:21.448 --> 06:24.049
I'm not calling about that.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.484
Just listen.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.453
I said, just listen.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.889
It's about my butt.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.257
Should I continue?

06:32.259 --> 06:33.558
I'm gonna say no.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.093
You won't frickin'
get away with this.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.596
Eat glass and die, you tramp!

06:37.598 --> 06:39.498
Mrs. Raws!

06:43.836 --> 06:45.837
Hey, uh, you're not
going to work.
- What are you
talking...?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.773
You're not
going to work.
- Yes, I'm going
to work!

06:47.775 --> 06:49.841
Sit down! Sit down!

06:50.977 --> 06:52.411
Of course
I'm going to work.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.812
Gina needs me.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.448
Besides, I like my stomach
like I like my suits--

06:56.450 --> 06:57.749
no lining.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.084
Here, take your
bottoms off,

06:59.086 --> 07:01.086
put these
sweatpants on.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.855
You take your bottoms off, sir!
Why don't you take
your slacks off,

07:03.857 --> 07:05.257
so I can put some sweatpants on?
Now take your bottoms off.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.958
I'm not gonna sit
around here all day

07:06.960 --> 07:08.960
like an off-duty
ice cream truck driver!

07:08.962 --> 07:11.930
I confiscated three laptops,
two tablets and an e-reader.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.699
Oh, and this satellite phone
with a condom taped to it.

07:14.701 --> 07:15.867
My earthquake kit?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.269
Hey, look, for
starters, Schmidt,

07:17.271 --> 07:18.603
you're sitting up
way too straight.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.971
I feel like
I'm sitting just fine.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.307
Take a deep breath.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.509
Inhale it all the way in.

07:24.511 --> 07:25.644
Now...

07:25.646 --> 07:26.845
(whispers):
let it go.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.780
(exhales)

07:29.615 --> 07:31.450
Now let go.
- (exhales)

07:31.452 --> 07:32.684
Now let go.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.152
I... I am letting go.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.054
You're like a clenched fist,
my man. Open up.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.392
You're in a 1920s
boxing stance.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.993
This is a waste of time!
You're not going to work!

07:41.995 --> 07:43.495
I have a
hyperactive nephew!

07:43.497 --> 07:44.796
We have to
swaddle him!

07:44.798 --> 07:46.164
Swaddle nothing! What?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.365
What are you doing?!
Swaddle him! Get him!

07:47.367 --> 07:49.201
Got to get to work!

07:49.203 --> 07:52.737
Shh. Shh.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.573
Shh. You relaxed?

07:54.575 --> 07:56.708
Yeah.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.009
Okay, ready?

07:58.011 --> 07:59.177
You're gonna lay down.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.879
All right, just
for a minute.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.048
¶ Good night, Schmidty. ¶

08:03.050 --> 08:05.050
(sighs)

08:07.820 --> 08:09.688
(whispers):
Now do me.
- Okay.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.089
(quiet chatter)

08:12.892 --> 08:14.159
Hey, what's up, girl?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.594
Hey, uh...

08:15.596 --> 08:17.596
remember when we used to
do it and it was dope?

08:17.598 --> 08:20.031
Nah.
- Nah?
What you talk...?

08:20.033 --> 08:22.501
You still like Ryan?
- Well...

08:22.503 --> 08:24.002
It's just the accent.
That's the only thing you...

08:24.004 --> 08:25.437
You like the accent?
I can do an accent.

08:25.439 --> 08:26.838
(Cockney accent):
I can do an accent.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.507
You like when
I do this accent, eh?

08:29.442 --> 08:30.909
You like when I do the accent?

08:30.911 --> 08:32.210
Not at all.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.279
My dad makes cheese.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.848
He just made me realize
that I want guys

08:36.850 --> 08:38.850
who have, like,
frickin' feelings and stuff.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.418
(normal voice):
Yeah, well...

08:40.420 --> 08:42.854
But the boy looks like
he was raised in a muffin.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.290
Oh. Hey.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.125
I've been holding
office hours all year,

08:47.127 --> 08:49.427
and this is the first time
anyone's taken me up on it.

08:49.429 --> 08:50.795
Ryan took you up on it,
didn't he?

08:50.797 --> 08:52.531
(teachers gasp, laugh)

08:52.533 --> 08:54.733
This is gonna be fine

08:54.735 --> 08:57.035
and, um, I'm going to address

08:57.037 --> 08:59.538
all of your problems
one by one.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.106
It just ain't right.
- Okay.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.807
"Ain't... right."

09:02.809 --> 09:04.075
Anything else?

09:04.077 --> 09:05.110
It's not okay.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.945
"Not... okay."

09:06.947 --> 09:08.213
What else?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.981
I'm not all right with it.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.417
And when you lent me
that sweater last week,

09:12.419 --> 09:15.720
was I supposed to, like...
Ruth!

09:15.722 --> 09:17.489
It's unscrupulous, Ms. Day.

09:17.491 --> 09:20.091
If you two are coming out,
we are, too.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.327
Meet my boyfriend.

09:23.629 --> 09:27.332
So you like... teachers?

09:30.970 --> 09:32.304
I'd do whatever it takes

09:32.306 --> 09:34.573
to get my foliage trip
off the ground.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.509
And now I know

09:37.511 --> 09:38.944
how things work
around here.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.913
You're not even my type,
just so you know.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.281
¶ Ba-da-da... ¶

09:43.283 --> 09:44.449
Don't do that.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.817
I'd be way more into this

09:45.819 --> 09:47.252
if you had, like,
a classic Latin build.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.120
Okay, stop. Stop!

09:49.122 --> 09:50.155
'Cause I'm a ginger?

09:50.157 --> 09:51.022
Just get out.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.625
(teachers murmuring)

09:53.627 --> 09:54.826
Ms. Day!

09:54.828 --> 09:57.662
(teachers clamoring)

09:58.931 --> 10:00.265
Okay!

10:00.267 --> 10:02.434
I changed my mind.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.169
We're gonna look at foliage.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.538
Now, will that make you people
go back to your jobs?

10:06.540 --> 10:08.173
Yeah.
- (murmuring agreement)

10:08.175 --> 10:10.875
I won something.
I won something.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.310
Hey.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.545
What's going on?

10:13.547 --> 10:15.213
Everybody was just so mad at me.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.948
I feel terrible.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.950
This is my fault.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.385
Jess, maybe I should
look for another job.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.454
No! No!
Absolutely not.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.055
No, look, I have everything
under control.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.024
I am 100% confident

10:26.026 --> 10:27.492
that I'm making
the right decision.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.960
WINSTON:<i> You got girl troubles,</i>
<i>get a crystal.</i>

10:28.962 --> 10:31.129
Look, I'm telling
you, Coach,

10:31.131 --> 10:33.064
women have been
checking me out all day.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.233
From the gentleman
across the bar.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.501
This is my favorite drink.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.736
How did he...?

10:37.738 --> 10:41.373
Something powerful
told me it was.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.477
Now, they gave me this crystal
to help me on the streets,

10:45.479 --> 10:46.845
but I'm starting to think

10:46.847 --> 10:49.381
it's gonna help me
in the sheets.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.082
Winston, look at me.
- Mm-hmm.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.384
And I have never
been more serious

10:52.386 --> 10:53.418
about anything in my life.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.520
Okay.
- Stop rhyming.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.388
All the timing?

10:56.390 --> 10:57.989
I don't need a crystal,

10:57.991 --> 10:59.658
I just need to be
more frickin' sensitive,

10:59.660 --> 11:01.092
so stop trying
to give me your crystal!

11:01.094 --> 11:03.428
Okay. I'm not supposed
to be yelling.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.929
That's what I'm...

11:04.931 --> 11:06.197
I need to be working...
I need to work on that.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.532
I'm telling
you, man,

11:07.534 --> 11:09.668
this crystal
gives you the courage

11:09.670 --> 11:12.404
to do the one thing
that you're scared of the most.

11:12.406 --> 11:15.173
To me, it's country music
line dancing.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.409
Well, that is terrifying.

11:17.411 --> 11:18.910
Don't do that.

11:20.913 --> 11:23.148
You guys seen Schmidt?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.583
What the hell?

11:25.585 --> 11:27.018
My word processor?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.522
You can't Kathy Bates me
forever!

11:30.524 --> 11:32.223
My work needs me.
Gina needs me.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.059
I'm sorry, but she's
trying to kill you,

11:34.061 --> 11:35.794
and I'm trying everything
in my power to stop her.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.696
No, you're trying
to turn me into you.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.899
Aren't you bored, Nick?

11:40.901 --> 11:42.367
I've been doing nothing
for exactly one day,

11:42.369 --> 11:43.601
and I already feel pathetic.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.537
The Nick that I met

11:45.539 --> 11:46.905
in college would not be happy
living like this.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.073
You've changed.
That's not true.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.041
I've always been lazy.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.210
Physically, yes.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.146
But mentally, you used to be
like a da Vinci in tie-dye.

12:01.587 --> 12:02.787
(clears throat)

12:02.789 --> 12:04.656
Well, I'll be.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.658
Think differently.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.093
The beer teat!

12:08.095 --> 12:09.394
Awesome, bro.
- Ha!

12:09.396 --> 12:11.529
Party!

12:13.666 --> 12:14.833
Well, you changed, too.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.068
You used to live
by your own rules.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.338
You were like a fat,
Jewish Dennis Rodman.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.107
But look at you now.

12:22.109 --> 12:25.176
You're like the back of a horse
in a two-person horse costume

12:25.178 --> 12:27.746
with Gina just farting
in your face all day long.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.547
That actually happened.

12:35.354 --> 12:37.122
What?!

12:37.124 --> 12:39.257
Schmidt, tell me, what do you
get for all your hard work?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.859
The sponge account.
Oh, great!

12:40.861 --> 12:42.927
God willing, it'll get me
red potatoes, too.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.296
Sexiest starch
since jasmine rice.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.631
Great.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.167
I hope your work
keeps making you walk around

12:49.169 --> 12:52.070
with your guts
in a rusty old wagon.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.408
(computer begins playing
'80s techno song)

13:03.949 --> 13:05.550
Oh, hey, Nick.
You're up early.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.418
Before noon.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.054
Oh, wait,
is this Sleepwalk Nick?

13:10.056 --> 13:12.157
Man, I love Sleepwalk Nick.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.459
He always pays back the money
that Awake Nick borrows from me.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.860
Of course I'm up!
I'm doing stuff.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.029
I do stuff.
I clean.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.165
I'm cooking right now.
I'm cooking breakfast.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.834
Sun's up, Miller's up.
People say that.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.470
Huh. Oh, hey, Coach.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.472
You're dressed like Ryan.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.973
What?
- (laughs)

13:28.975 --> 13:30.809
No, you see, I-I...
I've had these clothes

13:30.811 --> 13:32.744
for forever, I just don't
wear them when you're around.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.879
You are dressed like Ryan!
Are you around me
all the time? No.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.682
Dressing up like someone else
isn't going to work.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.984
Unlike this crystal.
Shut up.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.153
And I am never
taking this crystal off.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.155
Well, I mean, except if
I'm making a tomato sauce

13:44.157 --> 13:47.058
and the crystal keeps
dipping in the tomato sauce.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.160
Then I'll take it off,
and that's just being practical.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.763
I don't know too much
about crystal care, but,

13:51.765 --> 13:53.531
oh, I intend to find out.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.400
JESS:
See?

13:55.402 --> 13:56.835
I made the right decision.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.336
Kids need to be
in nature.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.772
Emily Kopnik
saw a butterfly

14:00.774 --> 14:02.574
and she said,
"Oh, my God,

14:02.576 --> 14:05.243
country lice
can fly."
- Oh, cool.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.512
Well, I'm sensitive and I care
about things like that.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.013
You like leaves, Eddie?

14:09.015 --> 14:09.881
No.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.115
Me, too, buddy. Me, too.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.384
So rake 'em

14:13.386 --> 14:16.521
into a observational
mound-- or "a pile"--

14:16.523 --> 14:18.423
and then we
transfer the piles

14:18.425 --> 14:20.525
into one of these
special research bags

14:20.527 --> 14:22.293
which you kids
can take home.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.695
Hey.

14:23.697 --> 14:24.929
What's happening here?

14:24.931 --> 14:26.130
Here's another rake.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.565
You're not just
having the kids, uh,

14:27.567 --> 14:29.234
rake the leaves
and put them in a bag,

14:29.236 --> 14:30.635
are you?
- What now?

14:30.637 --> 14:32.136
I mean, uh,
what else do you have planned?

14:32.138 --> 14:33.404
Oh, don't worry about it.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.273
I'm a biology professional.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.077
(groans)

14:39.079 --> 14:41.579
So, how's that phantom ulcer
treating you?

14:41.581 --> 14:42.914
I sent you those Q4 reports...

14:42.916 --> 14:44.315
Horrible burning!

14:44.317 --> 14:45.950
Well, I'm glad you're back.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.952
See? Look how glad I am.

14:47.954 --> 14:49.387
Gina, let me run point
on red potatoes.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.588
I've got three pitches

14:50.590 --> 14:51.923
already ready to rock.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.091
Here's a taste.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.659
That's the first one.

14:54.661 --> 14:55.994
That's the first pitch.
"Here's a taste."

14:55.996 --> 14:57.762
It's just a picture
of a red potato,

14:57.764 --> 14:59.497
and the tagline is:
"Here's a... here's a taste."

14:59.499 --> 15:02.467
There's that New York
sense of humor again, Schmidt.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.168
Come on, Gina. Give me
a shot at red potatoes.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.637
No way, 'cause I need you.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.305
You're the best sort of

15:07.307 --> 15:09.173
mid-level employee
I've ever had.

15:09.175 --> 15:11.409
You are the ass to my horse.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.077
And I'm gonna
keep you right here,

15:13.079 --> 15:15.280
right by my side,
where I can find you.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.481
Forever.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.749
Forever?

15:17.751 --> 15:18.850
Yeah, speaking of,

15:18.852 --> 15:20.752
might need you to suit up

15:20.754 --> 15:23.321
for my son's birthday
this Saturday, so...

15:23.323 --> 15:25.323
What are these?
Doesn't matter.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.458
Keep your phone on, okay?

15:27.460 --> 15:30.028
You know, sometimes
I think about life,

15:30.030 --> 15:33.097
and it just makes me
want to cry.

15:35.634 --> 15:37.435
Respond to my sharing, please.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.038
You're putting on a real creepy,
murdery vibe today.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.140
Just FYI.
- I'm not trying
to do that. I was...

15:42.142 --> 15:43.875
Just, like, going
forward in your day,

15:43.877 --> 15:45.877
you should know that.
Just trying to be,
like, feeling...

15:45.879 --> 15:47.712
Hey, guys.
- Hi.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.013
What's going on?

15:49.015 --> 15:50.682
RUTH: I think they might
just be doing

15:50.684 --> 15:52.216
frickin' yard work.
KIDS: ¶ I don't know ¶

15:52.218 --> 15:53.651
¶ What I been told ¶

15:53.653 --> 15:55.186
¶ I don't know
what I been told... ¶

15:55.188 --> 15:56.521
COACH:
Whoa.

15:56.523 --> 15:57.956
¶ Foster's butt is mighty old ¶

15:57.958 --> 16:01.025
¶ Foster's butt
is mighty old... ¶

16:01.027 --> 16:03.461
Oh, we are violating
every child labor law.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.297
They're really
good singers.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.700
Keep up the rhythm.
Mama won't be happy

16:08.702 --> 16:10.168
till you clear the back forty.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.669
Biology teacher?

16:11.671 --> 16:13.705
Is this your house?

16:13.707 --> 16:15.707
Did you bring
the kids here to work?

16:15.709 --> 16:17.809
First of all,
my name is Lorenzo.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.177
Secondly, yes.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.379
But you're the one
who picked my trip,

16:21.381 --> 16:22.981
so it's your fault.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.016
BOY:
Can I have some water?

16:25.018 --> 16:27.552
Okay, guys, stop working.
Don't listen to her.
Keep working.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.154
You don't have to work.
I'm the vice principal.
Not technically at school,

16:30.156 --> 16:31.823
so keep working.
Stop working!

16:31.825 --> 16:32.924
Keep working!

16:32.926 --> 16:34.559
(wasps buzzing)

16:34.561 --> 16:35.893
(screams)

16:36.729 --> 16:37.862
Oh! Oh!
- (gasping)

16:37.864 --> 16:39.864
Wasps! Everybody stay calm!

16:39.866 --> 16:42.533
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
they're getting in my eyes.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.202
Damn you bees!

16:44.204 --> 16:45.403
Ah! They got me!

16:45.405 --> 16:46.904
Ah, screw it.

16:46.906 --> 16:47.905
Here comes me.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.941
I sting, too, bees.

16:49.943 --> 16:52.143
Bees don't bother me.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.115
Seems like it was
a great field trip.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.383
So sorry I missed it.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.051
I feel like a bunch
of tiny people

17:00.053 --> 17:01.853
are holding tiny
little lighters to my face.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.521
(groans loudly)

17:03.523 --> 17:05.423
Today was a complete
and total disaster,

17:05.425 --> 17:07.125
from start to finish.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.395
I've never failed so hard
at my job ever in my life.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.363
Everyone's so mad at me,
but I was just trying

17:12.365 --> 17:13.965
to make them happy.
Jess, you can't
make everyone happy.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.366
COACH: You don't need
them to like you.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.235
You just need them
to listen to you.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.870
You're the boss.
- CECE:
Yeah.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.105
I mean, if you were a man
dating someone at work,

17:21.107 --> 17:22.774
do you think
that you would be worried

17:22.776 --> 17:24.542
about what everyone else
was thinking?

17:24.544 --> 17:25.777
COACH: You'd be, like,
in the conference room,

17:25.779 --> 17:27.078
like, "Meeting adjourned.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.546
Except for you, Sheila."

17:28.548 --> 17:29.914
But that's not me.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.083
I care what people think.
I always have.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.552
Then your only option
is to go in and be yourself.

17:35.621 --> 17:36.854
Just got to own it.

17:37.956 --> 17:39.557
I think I'm a little scared.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.593
Well, that's very
interesting. You see...

17:42.595 --> 17:44.829
Have you been here
this whole time?
The entire time.

17:44.831 --> 17:45.930
That is why

17:45.932 --> 17:48.900
God... made crystals.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.169
Why did he make that shirt?

17:57.176 --> 17:58.943
Hey.

17:58.945 --> 18:02.013
Hey, look, Nick,
I got to talk to you.
I got to talk to you.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.115
You go first.
- You go first.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.917
Okay, you know what?
You were right, Nick.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.485
I am a corporate monkey.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.320
I don't want
to be an old man

18:09.322 --> 18:12.290
looking back
on a meager life of...

18:12.292 --> 18:14.659
selling red potatoes
for the man.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.361
I don't want to be a
lazy bum my whole life.

18:17.363 --> 18:21.299
I want to be the kind of
bum that other bums look at

18:21.301 --> 18:24.135
and say, "What's that
bum smiling about?"

18:24.137 --> 18:25.870
I get that.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.505
I just had an idea, Schmidt.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.607
I just had an idea, too,
but I feel like it's stupid.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.943
Yeah, I feel like mine's
stupid. Let's do it.
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna...

18:31.945 --> 18:34.178
I'm gonna go to the kitchen.
No, but I want to hear
what you have to say.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.547
It's important to me-- 'cause
maybe it's the same thing,

18:36.549 --> 18:38.716
maybe it's different.
It might be the same thing,
so maybe we should just say it.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.152
You want to do the
classic on 11?
- Yeah, okay, great.

18:41.154 --> 18:44.055
BOTH: One, two, three,
four, five, six,

18:44.057 --> 18:45.857
seven, eight,
nine, ten, 11...

18:45.859 --> 18:47.825
Let's work together again!
Let's work together again!

18:47.827 --> 18:49.994
Yes! I knew it!
That was awesome!
That was it, man. That was it.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.129
Back in business.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.730
(laughs):
Yeah!

18:52.732 --> 18:53.865
Let's start jamming ideas.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.199
Turkey.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.568
Robot. Turkey robot.
Just got it in one.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.337
All right, let's
draw up a...
- I don't think we did.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.404
Okay.
- Ready? Black.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.806
Robot. Black robot.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.508
Ooh, that's even
better, son.
- Boom.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.176
Way to push
for number two.
- Let's... let's...

19:05.178 --> 19:06.711
Exactly...
- Black robot.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.346
The blackest
robot in town.

19:08.348 --> 19:11.215
That robot's so black,
it's the blackest.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.317
I feel like marketing's gonna
be a nightmare on that one.
- Okay.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.652
I'm not good at marketing.
I'm good at ideas.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.853
Let's stay away from robots.
- Okay.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.688
Yeah? All right.
- Okay.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.458
Robot robot.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.394
I said let's stay away
from robots though,

19:23.396 --> 19:25.062
and you just said ro...
- Okay.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.064
Black turkey!
- Look, let's maybe
pick it up later.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.167
Computers for babies.
We are back!

19:29.169 --> 19:31.269
Hair that looks like a helmet.
Or vice versa--

19:31.271 --> 19:33.271
helmet that looks like a hair
is actually pretty smart.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.572
Oh, I'm really hot right now.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.340
A water bottle
with the top cut off.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.910
SCHMIDT:
That's a cup!
That is just a cup. Scratch it.

19:38.912 --> 19:41.245
Ladies.
- (gasping)

19:41.247 --> 19:43.614
Ooh... you got
bee'd up, dude.
- Yeah.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.716
You look like a monster.
- Yeah.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.018
I'm not even joking.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.187
You look so ugly right now.
So ugly.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.089
Look, I'm not some little
sensitive British guy, okay?

19:52.091 --> 19:53.558
I am Coach.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.626
But right now, I am
in so much pain

19:55.628 --> 19:57.628
that I am losing my mind.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.363
And I might never recover.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.200
So say hello
to the new me,

20:02.202 --> 20:05.269
who's basically a street lunatic
with a face made of fire!

20:06.104 --> 20:07.705
They sting you
in your pants?

20:07.707 --> 20:10.708
Yeah, they... they
stung my doodad.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.476
I'm gonna get you
some lotion.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.813
Ow.
BOTH:
Ooh!

20:17.649 --> 20:20.418
JESS: Everyone, um,
before we begin this meeting,

20:20.420 --> 20:24.322
I just want to say that...
yes, Ryan is my boyfriend.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.390
And yes, I let it affect my job

20:26.392 --> 20:29.660
because I care what you think
of me, and I always have.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.229
But here's what you should know:

20:31.231 --> 20:34.966
I love my job, and I love
this man right here.

20:36.768 --> 20:38.336
Wow.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.805
I've been waiting
for a moment to tell you that,

20:40.807 --> 20:42.807
and I guess...

20:42.809 --> 20:44.809
this is it.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.277
This is perfect.

20:46.279 --> 20:49.413
And, um, just for the
record, I love you, too.

20:49.415 --> 20:52.783
This speech is wonderful,
so please keep going.

20:52.785 --> 20:56.754
Oh, yeah. Um, and you can
come to me with any problems

20:56.756 --> 20:58.422
or anything
you want to ask me,

20:58.424 --> 21:01.859
but I'm gonna make some
decisions that you don't like,

21:01.861 --> 21:05.329
and you're just gonna
have to deal with it.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.101
So, uh, let's get back
to work, okay?

21:10.103 --> 21:11.602
So is that the end
of the meeting, then?

21:11.604 --> 21:14.605
Yep. Uh... yeah,
I got a little carried away

21:14.607 --> 21:16.173
with the moment there.
(laughs)

21:16.175 --> 21:18.376
(laughs)
- Anyway...

21:19.845 --> 21:21.212
Put it on.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
- Put the crystal on.

21:21.214 --> 21:24.148
And... there we go.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.150
It's not gonna
do anything.

21:26.152 --> 21:29.453
¶ Any man of mine ¶

21:29.455 --> 21:32.490
¶ Better walk the line ¶

21:32.492 --> 21:35.393
¶ Better show me
a teasin', squeezin' ¶

21:35.395 --> 21:38.629
¶ Pleasin' kind of time ¶

21:38.631 --> 21:41.799
¶ I need a man who knows ¶

21:41.801 --> 21:45.036
¶ How the story goes ¶

21:45.038 --> 21:47.738
¶ He's gotta be a
heartbeatin', fine-treatin' ¶

21:47.740 --> 21:50.574
¶ Breathtakin',
earthquakin' kind... ¶

21:50.576 --> 21:52.643
¶ Any man of mine. ¶
