WEBVTT

00:05.003 --> 00:08.090
Megalithic stone columns
that have stood

00:08.090 --> 00:10.759
for an estimated 5,000 years.

00:10.759 --> 00:13.221
Stonehenge is
completely different

00:13.221 --> 00:15.223
to anything else
in the Neolithic world.

00:15.223 --> 00:17.975
NARRATOR:
But could Stonehenge
have been something more

00:17.975 --> 00:21.187
than conventional historians
have assumed?

00:21.187 --> 00:23.647
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
The fact that we now know
that Stonehenge

00:23.647 --> 00:26.818
was part of
a much larger superstructure

00:26.818 --> 00:30.612
indicates we're facing
a sensational mystery.

00:30.612 --> 00:32.698
NARRATOR:
And could
modern scientific findings

00:32.698 --> 00:35.076
reveal a startling truth?

00:35.076 --> 00:37.661
HUGH NEWMAN:
We don't really know
who these people were,

00:37.661 --> 00:39.539
don't really know
where they come from.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.665
WILLIAM HENRY:
The people who built Stonehenge

00:41.665 --> 00:43.542
just vanished from the Earth.

00:43.542 --> 00:46.670
NARRATOR:
Might the mystery of Stonehenge

00:46.670 --> 00:50.258
be the key to unlocking
the secrets of the universe,

00:50.258 --> 00:52.761
and provide tangible evidence

00:52.761 --> 00:56.139
of mankind's
extraterrestrial past?

00:56.139 --> 00:57.765
DAVID CHILDRESS:
Is it possible that Stonehenge

00:57.765 --> 01:02.686
was actually built by these
sophisticated extraterrestrials?

01:02.686 --> 01:05.564
It's a fantastic thought,
but it's possible.

01:08.692 --> 01:10.486
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:10.486 --> 01:12.989
in the universe.

01:12.989 --> 01:16.242
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:17.493 --> 01:20.287
It demands
we question everything

01:20.287 --> 01:22.664
we have ever been taught.

01:22.664 --> 01:26.168
The evidence is all around us.

01:26.168 --> 01:30.131
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:30.131 --> 01:33.009
We are not alone.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.094
We have never been alone.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.569
NARRATOR:
For six years,

01:51.569 --> 01:54.364
the U.K. Ministry of Defence
has been in a slow process

01:54.364 --> 01:57.741
of releasing the entirety
of their UFO files

01:57.741 --> 02:00.703
to the National Archives
of England.

02:00.703 --> 02:03.748
Now the final batch
of declassified reports

02:03.748 --> 02:05.792
are released to the public.

02:07.334 --> 02:10.045
Despite Ministry claims
that no credible evidence

02:10.045 --> 02:14.467
or alien craft was discovered
in over 50 years of study,

02:14.467 --> 02:18.555
one report,
from January 14, 2009,

02:18.555 --> 02:22.057
includes a fascinating photo
of a disk-shaped craft

02:22.057 --> 02:26.103
hovering above the world's
most famous megalithic site:

02:26.103 --> 02:29.314
Stonehenge.

02:29.314 --> 02:34.152
Stonehenge has been the site
of a number of UFO encounters

02:34.152 --> 02:35.572
over the years.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.991
The county of Wiltshire itself

02:38.991 --> 02:41.703
is something
of a UFO hot spot.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.789
Dating back over the lifetime

02:45.789 --> 02:48.793
of the Ministry of Defence's
UFO project,

02:48.793 --> 02:51.211
there have probably been
several hundred,

02:51.211 --> 02:54.674
if not low thousands,
of sightings recorded

02:54.674 --> 02:56.675
in the county of Wiltshire.

02:58.260 --> 03:01.180
NARRATOR:
But Stonehenge is
not only a major hot spot

03:01.180 --> 03:04.099
for UFO reports,
it is also the center

03:04.099 --> 03:06.311
of the crop circle phenomenon,

03:06.311 --> 03:10.105
with dozens of unexplained
crop formations appearing

03:10.105 --> 03:12.233
in the area every year.

03:13.610 --> 03:17.155
Many of the most
spectacular formations

03:17.155 --> 03:19.949
have appeared
in that geographical area.

03:19.949 --> 03:23.620
This is a location
where there has been

03:23.620 --> 03:25.663
more than, I suppose,

03:25.663 --> 03:28.957
a fair share of weirdness
over the years.

03:28.957 --> 03:31.169
People are
kind of obsessed by it,

03:31.169 --> 03:33.795
because it's the only way
they can get back

03:33.795 --> 03:36.633
to have some contact
with their ancestors.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.801
I believe there's much,
much more going on here.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.097
NARRATOR:
Why does the area of Stonehenge

03:43.097 --> 03:45.182
experience
more unexplained phenomena

03:45.182 --> 03:48.186
than any other place on Earth?

03:48.186 --> 03:52.439
Could a new examination
of these massive stone blocks

03:52.439 --> 03:55.401
reveal profound truths
that have remained hidden

03:55.401 --> 03:58.362
for more than 5,000 years?

04:02.866 --> 04:04.661
The British Isles.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.246
55 BC.

04:07.246 --> 04:10.707
Julius Caesar begins
a military campaign

04:10.707 --> 04:14.169
to extend the Roman Empire
into Britain.

04:14.169 --> 04:18.132
His forces are met
by ferocious resistance

04:18.132 --> 04:22.220
from the native Celtic tribes,
led by their Druid priests.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.180
GRAHAM PHILLIPS:
The tribes of Britain

04:25.180 --> 04:28.434
were all united
against the warring Romans

04:28.434 --> 04:31.353
by the Druids,

04:31.353 --> 04:35.399
to repel the greatest general
who's ever lived.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.446
NARRATOR:
It would take the Romans
nearly a century

04:40.446 --> 04:42.781
to conquer Britain.

04:42.781 --> 04:45.784
Once they succeeded,
they turned Stonehenge

04:45.784 --> 04:48.579
into a temple
of their sun god, Apollo.

04:48.579 --> 04:52.000
But the Romans were not
the first to adopt this monument

04:52.000 --> 04:53.959
as their own.

04:53.959 --> 04:57.170
The Celts themselves
had migrated into Britain

04:57.170 --> 05:00.425
some 2,500 years before.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.802
When they arrived,
Stonehenge was already there,

05:03.802 --> 05:07.180
but the country was
eerily deserted.

05:09.057 --> 05:12.644
The people who are responsible
for Stonehenge, for erecting it,

05:12.644 --> 05:15.189
are nowhere to be seen,
and this is a puzzling,

05:15.189 --> 05:17.567
uh, piece of information
that we know now.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.194
NARRATOR:
Instead of ignoring Stonehenge

05:20.194 --> 05:23.447
and building new temples,
as historians would expect,

05:23.447 --> 05:26.324
the Celts adopted it
as their own.

05:26.324 --> 05:28.119
You have to ask yourself:

05:28.119 --> 05:31.413
Why did the Celts and Druids
adopt Stonehenge

05:31.413 --> 05:34.417
as a place of worship
if they didn't build it?

05:34.417 --> 05:38.086
Did they somehow know
the power of the place?

05:39.463 --> 05:41.340
NARRATOR:
Archaeologists today believe

05:41.340 --> 05:43.384
that this great
Neolithic stone circle

05:43.384 --> 05:45.762
has stood on the plains
of Wiltshire, England,

05:45.762 --> 05:49.723
for no less than 5,000 years.

05:49.723 --> 05:53.185
An outer ring
of 30 four-ton stones

05:53.185 --> 05:55.103
surrounds five huge arches

05:55.103 --> 05:59.317
whose massive blocks weigh
22 tons each,

05:59.317 --> 06:02.569
and which were
somehow transported

06:02.569 --> 06:05.906
from 120 miles away.

06:05.906 --> 06:09.911
It's an astonishing feat
of ancient engineering,

06:09.911 --> 06:13.538
and the mysteries about
its construction still remain.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.418
NEWMAN:
Some of the stones at Stonehenge

06:17.418 --> 06:19.711
weigh between 50 and 70 tons.

06:19.711 --> 06:21.798
Some of the stones are
even heavier.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.882
So how could you
have moved these into place?

06:23.882 --> 06:25.718
How could you have moved them
from Wales,

06:25.718 --> 06:28.346
where the bluestones,
the spotted dolerite, came from,

06:28.346 --> 06:29.639
within Stonehenge?

06:30.889 --> 06:32.641
PHILLIPS:
The bluestones,

06:32.641 --> 06:35.894
from which the original
Stonehenge was constructed,

06:35.894 --> 06:40.899
were transported from
120 miles to the west

06:40.899 --> 06:44.862
from a place called
the Preseli Mountains,

06:44.862 --> 06:46.738
which is the only place
in the British Isles

06:46.738 --> 06:48.533
where you can get
that kind of stone.

06:48.533 --> 06:52.745
Now, how they were moved
is a mystery.

06:54.204 --> 06:56.165
NARRATOR:
The predominant theory

06:56.165 --> 06:59.543
as to how the megalithic blocks
were moved is that the builders

06:59.543 --> 07:02.588
fashioned sledges and rollers
out of tree trunks

07:02.588 --> 07:06.425
to lug the bluestones
from the Preseli Hills,

07:06.425 --> 07:08.136
then transferred them onto rafts

07:08.136 --> 07:10.637
and floated them
first along the Welsh coast

07:10.637 --> 07:14.475
and then up the River Avon
towards Salisbury Plain.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.310
TSOUKALOS:
You know, this idea

07:17.310 --> 07:19.355
that all these ancient blocks
were moved

07:19.355 --> 07:21.524
with, uh, wooden rollers is...

07:21.524 --> 07:23.608
is very interesting.

07:23.608 --> 07:25.778
However, do you know
what happens to wood

07:25.778 --> 07:29.115
when you put 20 tons
on a wooden roller?

07:29.115 --> 07:31.283
It'll just get crushed
to smithereens.

07:32.492 --> 07:34.077
PHILLIPS:
However they did it,

07:34.077 --> 07:36.079
it must have been
very important for them

07:36.079 --> 07:38.081
to move these particular stones
to Stonehenge.

07:38.081 --> 07:39.375
And that's a mystery.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.668
That doesn't happen
anywhere else

07:41.668 --> 07:43.588
at stone circles in the country.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.716
They only come from stone
that's quarried locally.

07:48.425 --> 07:50.511
NARRATOR:
However Stonehenge
was constructed,

07:50.511 --> 07:53.555
it involved moving much more
than just the stone blocks

07:53.555 --> 07:55.766
that stand today.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.643
According to researchers,

07:57.643 --> 08:01.605
this is just 25%
of the original monument,

08:01.605 --> 08:03.899
the center of
a much larger structure

08:03.899 --> 08:07.819
that was surrounded
by multiple concentric circles

08:07.819 --> 08:11.824
constructed over a period
of more than a thousand years.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.076
MARTINEAU: So Stonehenge
is very interesting

08:14.076 --> 08:17.413
in that it evolves
over a very long period of time.

08:17.413 --> 08:20.499
And the first thing
that goes up at Stonehenge

08:20.499 --> 08:22.584
is not there anymore.

08:22.584 --> 08:24.754
It's the 56 holes

08:24.754 --> 08:27.464
that today are known
as the Aubrey Circle.

08:27.464 --> 08:31.093
It used to be filled with
the bluestones from Preseli.

08:31.093 --> 08:33.971
PHILLIPS:
Around the outside
of the stone circle

08:33.971 --> 08:36.557
is constructed
a ditch and embankment.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.976
This is the so-called
"henge" structure

08:39.976 --> 08:43.773
that stands around Stonehenge,
from where it gets its name.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.234
NARRATOR:
Many mainstream scholars

08:46.234 --> 08:49.486
suggest that Stonehenge
was simply a place of worship

08:49.486 --> 08:52.447
and a burial ground.

08:52.447 --> 08:54.533
But why would
the ancient people of Britain

08:54.533 --> 08:56.534
have spent
more than a thousand years

08:56.534 --> 09:00.331
to build what amounts
to a church and a cemetery?

09:00.331 --> 09:02.625
NEWMAN:
And the big problem is
we don't really know

09:02.625 --> 09:04.125
who these people were.

09:04.125 --> 09:06.504
We don't really know
where they come from.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.923
So we find similar structures
around the world

09:08.923 --> 09:11.509
that show incredible levels
of sophistication,

09:11.509 --> 09:13.970
like the Pyramids of Giza
in Egypt,

09:13.970 --> 09:16.138
like Machu Picchu in Peru.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.599
So why not, in ancient Britain,

09:18.599 --> 09:21.644
why not have a very advanced
civilization here?

09:23.520 --> 09:26.231
The fact that we now know
that Stonehenge was part

09:26.231 --> 09:29.025
of a much larger superstructure

09:29.025 --> 09:34.197
indicates to me that we've only
barely scratched the surface.

09:34.197 --> 09:36.575
What did it all mean?

09:37.784 --> 09:39.620
NARRATOR:
If the monolithic stones

09:39.620 --> 09:41.580
that comprise Stonehenge today

09:41.580 --> 09:43.832
are only merely
a partial skeleton

09:43.832 --> 09:46.668
of the original complex,
is it possible

09:46.668 --> 09:49.672
that it was among the most
sophisticated structures

09:49.672 --> 09:51.631
of the ancient world?

09:51.631 --> 09:55.010
Perhaps the answers
to who built it--

09:55.010 --> 09:58.556
and why-- can be found
by examining similar structures

09:58.556 --> 10:01.100
found all over the world.

10:10.817 --> 10:12.528
Each circle corresponds
NARRATOR:
Dr. William Stukeley,

10:12.528 --> 10:15.489
a pioneer
in the field of archaeology,

10:15.489 --> 10:18.951
begins the first
scientific survey of Stonehenge.

10:18.951 --> 10:23.538
He quickly notices that
its axis aligns with sunrise

10:23.538 --> 10:25.541
on the summer solstice.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.962
Over the centuries, scientists
discover that Stonehenge

10:30.962 --> 10:35.009
also points to sunset
on the winter solstice

10:35.009 --> 10:38.428
and contains dozens of other
astronomical alignments.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.850
NEWMAN: Stonehenge is
unlike any stone circle

10:43.850 --> 10:45.436
anywhere on the planet.

10:45.436 --> 10:49.190
It's perfectly circular.
It has lintels above it.

10:49.190 --> 10:53.110
It's designed with
precision-engineered carving

10:53.110 --> 10:55.528
and astronomical alignments.

10:57.280 --> 11:00.784
TSOUKALOS: In my opinion,
it is Stonehenge itself

11:00.784 --> 11:02.327
that is the message.

11:02.327 --> 11:05.121
And one part of that message
is that Stonehenge

11:05.121 --> 11:09.250
is a replica of
our solar system on Earth.

11:09.250 --> 11:13.380
Each circle corresponds
with one of our planets

11:13.380 --> 11:17.384
inside our solar system,
including Pluto.

11:17.384 --> 11:21.221
So, now we have a structure
that's at least 4,000 years old,

11:21.221 --> 11:24.225
and our ancestors
knew about Pluto?

11:24.225 --> 11:26.769
Without telescopes?

11:26.769 --> 11:29.938
Someone told them about Pluto

11:29.938 --> 11:33.484
and all of our planets
in our solar system,

11:33.484 --> 11:37.529
and that is the message,
because in Neolithic time,

11:37.529 --> 11:41.366
there is no way
that they knew about this.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.163
NARRATOR:
Is it possible
that the massive blocks

11:46.163 --> 11:48.289
still standing at Stonehenge

11:48.289 --> 11:50.918
were purposely arranged
to reflect the positions

11:50.918 --> 11:54.171
of the planets
in our solar system?

11:54.171 --> 11:58.134
And if so, could this
astronomical knowledge

11:58.134 --> 12:02.804
have been imparted to our
ancestors by extraterrestrials?

12:02.804 --> 12:06.057
While Stonehenge
is the most extraordinary

12:06.057 --> 12:08.059
stone circle in England,

12:08.059 --> 12:12.856
in the 1970s, Scottish
cartographer Alexander Thom

12:12.856 --> 12:17.193
found that all the famed
stone circles across the U.K.

12:17.193 --> 12:19.738
have sophisticated designs
that track the movements

12:19.738 --> 12:22.115
of planets and constellations.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.452
NEWMAN:
Alexander Thom surveyed

12:25.452 --> 12:28.538
over 300 stone circles
in Britain.

12:28.538 --> 12:30.541
And he came up
with this principle

12:30.541 --> 12:34.211
that they used advanced geometry
in the construction,

12:34.211 --> 12:38.631
which was connected
with very advanced astronomy.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.636
NARRATOR:
Over time,
archaeologists began to find

12:43.636 --> 12:46.014
that ancient megalithic sites
all over the planet

12:46.014 --> 12:49.809
were built to align
with the sun.

12:49.809 --> 12:51.895
In Macedonia,

12:51.895 --> 12:55.274
the Kokino Observatory
features four stone thrones

12:55.274 --> 12:56.859
at the top of a mountain

12:56.859 --> 13:00.111
positioned to track
the solstices and equinoxes.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.491
In Machu Picchu,
there is a stone temple

13:04.491 --> 13:06.451
with three trapezoidal windows

13:06.451 --> 13:08.828
also positioned
to align with the sun

13:08.828 --> 13:11.248
during the solstices
and equinoxes.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.336
On the northwest coast
of France,

13:15.336 --> 13:18.379
a collection
of over 3,000 massive rocks,

13:18.379 --> 13:20.298
called the "Carnac stones,"

13:20.298 --> 13:24.886
align with both the summer
and winter solstices.

13:24.886 --> 13:27.514
And some of the sites
where these solar alignments

13:27.514 --> 13:31.936
are found include stone circles
similar to Stonehenge.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.941
The entrance
to the Temple of Mnajdra

13:36.941 --> 13:39.360
on the Mediterranean island
of Malta

13:39.360 --> 13:42.863
is aligned to mark both
the solstices and equinoxes.

13:44.405 --> 13:46.408
NEWMAN:
In ancient Malta, going back

13:46.408 --> 13:48.619
potentially to 3,000,

13:48.619 --> 13:51.496
to 4,000 B.C.
or even much older,

13:51.496 --> 13:53.164
they also were observing

13:53.164 --> 13:55.417
multiple
different constellations,

13:55.417 --> 13:57.503
including Taurus and others.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.591
NARRATOR:
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

14:02.591 --> 14:05.177
the most significant
of all the ancient sites

14:05.177 --> 14:07.388
that contain
astronomical alignments

14:07.388 --> 14:10.014
is also the oldest.

14:18.982 --> 14:22.318
German archaeologist
Klaus Schmidt begins

14:22.318 --> 14:25.197
a major excavation
at Gobekli Tepe.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.950
This prehistoric site
was believed

14:27.950 --> 14:30.952
to contain a standard
Roman-era cemetery.

14:30.952 --> 14:34.289
But what Schmidt actually
discovered would revolutionize

14:34.289 --> 14:37.042
our view of the ancient world.

14:37.042 --> 14:40.086
TSOUKALOS:
Gobekli Tepe is one
of the most fascinating stories

14:40.086 --> 14:42.965
that we have in archaeology
in recent times.

14:44.173 --> 14:47.010
It is the first documented

14:47.010 --> 14:50.597
and confirmed archaeological
site in the world

14:50.597 --> 14:54.893
that proves its age dating
as far back

14:54.893 --> 14:57.104
as 10,000 BC.

14:58.980 --> 15:02.567
NEWMAN:
Gobekli Tepe is the oldest known
stone circle complex.

15:02.567 --> 15:06.447
It dates to nearly
12,000 years old,

15:06.447 --> 15:10.743
and it stands out as one of the
most unique sites on the planet.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.163
It really shouldn't be there
at this date.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.664
It wasn't
for many thousands of years

15:16.664 --> 15:19.626
that Stonehenge was built.

15:19.626 --> 15:23.004
ANDREW COLLINS: Stonehenge
in Britain was constructed

15:23.004 --> 15:26.884
around 3000 BC, but

15:26.884 --> 15:30.596
as much as 6,000 years earlier

15:30.596 --> 15:32.847
in southeast Turkey,

15:32.847 --> 15:35.975
Gobekli Tepe was built

15:35.975 --> 15:41.315
by a very early form
of Neolithic people.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.610
And here you have a series

15:44.610 --> 15:47.403
of circular monuments,

15:47.403 --> 15:50.698
each made of T-shaped pillars,

15:50.698 --> 15:53.826
like spokes of a wheel
radiating out

15:53.826 --> 15:55.663
from a central spot

15:55.663 --> 15:59.500
where there are
two huge monoliths

15:59.500 --> 16:03.336
as much
as 18 and a half feet tall.

16:05.630 --> 16:08.549
NARRATOR:
According to mainstream
archaeologists,

16:08.549 --> 16:11.220
one of the reasons
that Gobekli Tepe has survived

16:11.220 --> 16:15.349
in such remarkable condition
for more than 10,000 years

16:15.349 --> 16:18.394
is because
it was deliberately buried.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.062
But why?

16:20.062 --> 16:21.980
Was it to protect it

16:21.980 --> 16:24.732
from some catastrophic event?

16:24.732 --> 16:28.403
Or was it to hide what ancient
astronaut theorists consider

16:28.403 --> 16:31.532
the structure's
otherworldly origins?

16:31.532 --> 16:35.952
Perhaps the answer can be found
by a further examination

16:35.952 --> 16:39.373
of not only
who may have built Gobekli Tepe,

16:39.373 --> 16:42.042
but why.

16:46.587 --> 16:49.383
weighing up to ten tons,
HENRY:
We look around at templestons

16:49.383 --> 16:52.302
sophisticated carvings,

16:52.302 --> 16:56.389
and even signs
of hieroglyphic writing...

16:56.389 --> 16:59.643
experts say Gobekli Tepe
could only have been built

16:59.643 --> 17:01.812
by an advanced civilization.

17:01.812 --> 17:06.066
But according
to mainstream historians,

17:06.066 --> 17:09.236
the world's first
true civilization--

17:09.236 --> 17:11.404
the Sumerians-- did not arise

17:11.404 --> 17:15.951
until thousands of years
after Gobekli Tepe was built.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.871
BILL BIRNES:
What we know about Gobekli Tepe

17:18.871 --> 17:20.497
is that the Sumerians

17:20.497 --> 17:23.040
said, "Oh, they were built
by the ancients."

17:23.040 --> 17:27.128
Who were the ancients that were
here before the Sumerians?

17:27.128 --> 17:32.550
So, we actually have
geological artifacts

17:32.550 --> 17:34.886
that point us to a civilization

17:34.886 --> 17:37.306
<i>before</i> civilization.

17:37.306 --> 17:41.018
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

17:41.018 --> 17:43.854
Gobekli Tepe provides evidence

17:43.854 --> 17:46.522
that a highly-advanced
civilization flourished

17:46.522 --> 17:48.817
long before the Sumerians.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.862
And they suggest
that a written record

17:51.862 --> 17:55.574
of this civilization can be
found in the Book of Enoch

17:55.574 --> 17:58.535
and its mysterious tale
of the Watchers.

17:59.869 --> 18:01.788
HENRY:
According to the Book of Enoch,

18:01.788 --> 18:03.624
there was an ancient race
of giants

18:03.624 --> 18:05.375
who descended to the Earth.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.878
They brought technology with
them and shared it with humans.

18:08.878 --> 18:12.590
They were called the Anunnaki,

18:12.590 --> 18:14.634
also known as the Watchers,

18:14.634 --> 18:18.471
extraterrestrial beings
who lived near Gobekli Tepe.

18:20.473 --> 18:22.267
TSOUKALOS:
In the Old Testament,

18:22.267 --> 18:24.978
there are quite a few passages
that speak

18:24.978 --> 18:28.690
of when the sons of God
encountered the women of Earth.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.692
They thought of them
quite beautiful.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.694
And so they mated with them,

18:33.694 --> 18:37.365
and the offspring were
the so-called giants.

18:37.365 --> 18:39.576
NARRATOR
According to the Book of Enoch,

18:39.576 --> 18:43.622
these hybrid offspring were
giants called the Nephilim.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.834
They built a glittering
high-tech civilization.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.125
(thunder crashing)

18:48.125 --> 18:50.753
But God considered them
an abomination

18:50.753 --> 18:55.550
and sent a great flood
to wipe them out.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.344
HENRY:
Going back 5,000 years,

18:57.344 --> 19:00.388
we have sacred texts
that tell us

19:00.388 --> 19:03.517
there was
an antediluvian civilization.

19:06.561 --> 19:09.189
There was a great flood
and that there were survivors.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.942
The Mesopotamians speak of this
in<i> The Epic of Gilgamesh,</i>

19:11.942 --> 19:16.195
the Egyptians speak of this
in the Edfu creation texts.

19:16.195 --> 19:18.574
We look around at temples
and other constructions

19:18.574 --> 19:21.117
that suddenly blossomed
as if out of thin air.

19:21.117 --> 19:22.618
We're asked to believe

19:22.618 --> 19:25.538
that suddenly
humanity learned the skills

19:25.538 --> 19:27.790
for building
these magnificent monuments

19:27.790 --> 19:29.710
that we can't even duplicate
today.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.336
It doesn't make sense,

19:31.336 --> 19:34.047
unless there was some
pre-flood teacher indeed

19:34.047 --> 19:36.048
that taught us how to do this.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.385
According to some traditions,

19:39.385 --> 19:41.721
some of the Nephilim
survived the flood.

19:41.721 --> 19:45.267
These hybrid children
of the Anunnaki still knew

19:45.267 --> 19:46.977
how to build
megalithic monuments

19:46.977 --> 19:49.896
aligned with the stars,
and that's what they did.

19:49.896 --> 19:54.026
NARRATOR:
Tradition has it
that after surviving the flood

19:54.026 --> 19:56.569
and building Gobekli Tepe
in Turkey,

19:56.569 --> 19:58.779
the Nephilim began to migrate.

19:58.779 --> 20:01.325
And each place they went,

20:01.325 --> 20:04.661
they left stone circles
in their wake.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.747
COLLINS:
After Gobekli Tepe,

20:06.747 --> 20:11.417
there are other stone circles
before we get to Stonehenge.

20:11.417 --> 20:14.171
For instance, at Karahunj

20:14.171 --> 20:18.299
in Armenia,
there is a massive series

20:18.299 --> 20:21.970
of megalithic constructions
and circles

20:21.970 --> 20:27.392
which have been dated
to approximately 5500 BC,

20:27.392 --> 20:30.645
according
to the astronomical alignments.

20:30.645 --> 20:33.773
Other sites
that are of extreme age include

20:33.773 --> 20:35.817
Cromlech Almendres in Portugal.

20:35.817 --> 20:40.113
This dates back
to around 6,000 years.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.493
NARRATOR:
If the Nephilim were responsible

20:45.493 --> 20:49.914
for all these stone circles,
is it possible that these giants

20:49.914 --> 20:53.125
ultimately found refuge
in the British Isles

20:53.125 --> 20:55.503
and built Stonehenge?

20:55.503 --> 20:58.757
Many believe that supporting
evidence is found

20:58.757 --> 21:03.595
in a 12th century book by Welsh
cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth,

21:03.595 --> 21:05.888
<i>The History of the Kings
of Britain.</i>

21:05.888 --> 21:10.227
It states that Stonehenge was
erected by giants in Ireland,

21:10.227 --> 21:12.645
then transported
to its current site

21:12.645 --> 21:14.981
by the famed magician Merlin.

21:14.981 --> 21:17.608
JONATHAN YOUNG: The story
has it, the king wanted

21:17.608 --> 21:19.611
to honor the dead
from a great battle,

21:19.611 --> 21:22.154
and he wanted
a particular monument

21:22.154 --> 21:23.740
the giants had built in Ireland.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.491
It was Stonehenge.

21:25.491 --> 21:28.662
He sent Merlin
to get this thing.

21:28.662 --> 21:31.748
Merlin used magic
to move it to Somerset.

21:31.748 --> 21:34.960
This is how it got
to where it presently is.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.627
NEWMAN:
And somehow he did this.

21:36.627 --> 21:39.256
Whether it was magic,
we really don't know.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.258
But we do know
that there are traditions

21:41.258 --> 21:43.426
of giants moving stones.

21:43.426 --> 21:45.261
CHILDRESS:
We have to ask ourselves,

21:45.261 --> 21:47.221
is it possible
that the Nephilim,

21:47.221 --> 21:49.391
as descendants of the Anunnaki,

21:49.391 --> 21:51.727
were the actual builders
of Stonehenge

21:51.727 --> 21:54.645
and other megaliths
in Great Britain?

21:54.645 --> 21:57.857
And, in fact, uh, that
may well have been the case.

21:57.857 --> 22:00.609
NARRATOR:
To further support the notion

22:00.609 --> 22:04.071
that the Anunnaki
not only built Stonehenge

22:04.071 --> 22:08.951
but also other megalithic
stone circles like Gobekli Tepe,

22:08.951 --> 22:14.332
ancient astronaut theorists
point to a curious legend

22:14.332 --> 22:19.587
concerning a tribe known
as the Tuatha Dé Danann.

22:19.587 --> 22:21.923
TOK THOMPSON:
The Tuatha Dé Danann

22:21.923 --> 22:25.093
are probably
the most important tribe

22:25.093 --> 22:26.928
or figures or group of people--

22:26.928 --> 22:30.265
if they are people-- uh,
that show up in Irish mythology.

22:31.557 --> 22:34.269
The Tuatha Dé Danann
were special.

22:35.686 --> 22:38.190
CHILDRESS:
The Tuatha Dé Danann were tall.

22:38.190 --> 22:42.193
They had red hair
and blue or green eyes.

22:42.193 --> 22:44.278
They had magical powers.

22:45.529 --> 22:48.700
NEWMAN:
They had very advanced weaponry

22:48.700 --> 22:51.327
and different types of
what sounds like machinery.

22:51.327 --> 22:54.914
But also they taught
the high arts of civilization

22:54.914 --> 22:58.167
and they were said to be
almost like the Shining Ones

22:58.167 --> 23:00.336
of the biblical tradition.

23:00.336 --> 23:02.338
NARRATOR:
Could it be

23:02.338 --> 23:04.965
that the Tuatha Dé Danann
were the descendants

23:04.965 --> 23:07.551
of the otherworldly beings
described

23:07.551 --> 23:11.181
in the Sumerian tradition
as the Anunnaki?

23:11.181 --> 23:13.933
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes.

23:13.933 --> 23:15.352
And as evidence,

23:15.352 --> 23:18.230
they point
to a curious historic fact.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.316
The Tuatha Dé Danann,
or tribe of Danann,

23:21.316 --> 23:23.734
originally had a different name,

23:23.734 --> 23:25.778
the Tuatha Dé Anu.

23:25.778 --> 23:30.116
CHILDRESS:
The name means
"the tribe of Anu."

23:30.116 --> 23:33.787
And Anu here is the Anunnaki.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.455
It's this mysterious people

23:36.455 --> 23:39.291
who are talked about
in Sumerian texts.

23:39.291 --> 23:41.877
So, here we now have
a connection

23:41.877 --> 23:43.462
with the Tuatha Dé Danann

23:43.462 --> 23:47.384
with the Anunnaki
of ancient Sumeria.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.885
NARRATOR:
Did these Anunnaki descendants

23:49.885 --> 23:52.138
really migrate
to the British Isles

23:52.138 --> 23:54.598
and ultimately build Stonehenge?

23:54.598 --> 23:57.685
And if so,
could this shed light

23:57.685 --> 24:01.522
on the mystery of not only who
built Stonehenge but why?

24:01.522 --> 24:04.776
Perhaps further clues
can be found

24:04.776 --> 24:07.403
by examining
a startling new genetic study

24:07.403 --> 24:10.073
that indicates that,

24:10.073 --> 24:12.032
almost immediately after
Stonehenge was built,

24:12.032 --> 24:13.785
its builders

24:13.785 --> 24:17.372
mysteriously vanished
from the Earth.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.884
NARRATOR:
In a groundbreaking
So the pgenetic studylt this,

24:28.884 --> 24:31.135
published in the journal<i> Nature,</i>

24:31.135 --> 24:34.306
Harvard researchers announce
a stunning discovery

24:34.306 --> 24:36.599
about ancient human DNA.

24:36.599 --> 24:39.185
It reveals that,

24:39.185 --> 24:41.605
immediately after Stonehenge
was built,

24:41.605 --> 24:43.022
the people who built it,

24:43.022 --> 24:45.025
the ancient inhabitants
of Britain,

24:45.025 --> 24:49.362
suddenly and almost totally
vanished from the British Isles.

24:49.362 --> 24:52.281
They left behind
virtually no DNA

24:52.281 --> 24:55.326
in the modern
British population.

24:56.368 --> 24:58.371
What the 2018 study suggests

24:58.371 --> 25:01.540
is that the genetic signature
of the Neolithic inhabitants

25:01.540 --> 25:02.834
of the British Isles,

25:02.834 --> 25:06.755
it vanishes
shortly after the period

25:06.755 --> 25:09.673
in which they build Stonehenge
and is largely replaced

25:09.673 --> 25:11.759
by an entirely new human culture

25:11.759 --> 25:13.510
in a very short amount of time.

25:13.510 --> 25:16.765
HENRY: The Harvard study is
an absolute bombshell.

25:16.765 --> 25:21.603
An entire civilization
just disappears without a trace,

25:21.603 --> 25:23.646
vanishes into thin air?

25:23.646 --> 25:27.817
It's easily the most surprising
and most shocking conclusion

25:27.817 --> 25:29.236
you can imagine.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.238
NARRATOR:
The study used

25:31.238 --> 25:33.490
a revolutionary new technique

25:33.490 --> 25:36.534
that samples DNA
from ancient human bones

25:36.534 --> 25:38.869
and then compares it to the DNA

25:38.869 --> 25:41.455
of modern people
in the same place.

25:41.455 --> 25:44.125
Scientists then determine

25:44.125 --> 25:46.627
what percentage
of the modern population

25:46.627 --> 25:49.381
is descended
from the ancient group.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.634
So, the new genetic data
are really providing

25:52.634 --> 25:55.386
an example
of population replacement,

25:55.386 --> 26:00.392
in which the genetic markers
that characterize one population

26:00.392 --> 26:04.729
is almost entirely replaced in a
relatively short amount of time

26:04.729 --> 26:07.481
by the genetic signature that
characterizes another population

26:07.481 --> 26:08.942
from a different part
of the world.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.694
NARRATOR:
The strange disappearance

26:11.694 --> 26:13.279
of the Stonehenge builders

26:13.279 --> 26:16.365
remains
a profound historical mystery.

26:16.365 --> 26:20.244
But historians had long known
that around 2500 BC,

26:20.244 --> 26:22.747
just after Stonehenge was built,

26:22.747 --> 26:25.750
a new group
entered the British Isles.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.336
The so-called Beaker people
are named

26:28.336 --> 26:30.630
for their distinctive
clay pottery

26:30.630 --> 26:33.883
and are believed to be
the ancestors of the Celts.

26:33.883 --> 26:36.594
CHILDRESS:
You might think that

26:36.594 --> 26:40.222
when the original population
of Britain suddenly left

26:40.222 --> 26:43.518
these stone monuments,

26:43.518 --> 26:46.186
that the newcomers
would maybe just let them

26:46.186 --> 26:50.692
go back to nature and
ultimately just-just fall down

26:50.692 --> 26:53.528
and be destroyed, uh, over time.

26:53.528 --> 26:55.195
But that's not what happened.

26:55.195 --> 26:58.450
And so it would seem
that these newcomers

26:58.450 --> 27:01.368
realized
that these places had power.

27:01.368 --> 27:03.997
There was an energy associated
with them.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.665
Something important.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.967
NARRATOR:
The Orkney Islands, Scotland.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.678
2019.

27:18.678 --> 27:21.765
Ancient astronaut theorist
Andrew Collins

27:21.765 --> 27:24.183
and author Graham Phillips

27:24.183 --> 27:26.603
have come to these islands
to investigate

27:26.603 --> 27:30.565
the mysterious disappearance of
the people who built Stonehenge.

27:30.565 --> 27:34.234
Dating back to 3200 BC,

27:34.234 --> 27:38.239
Skara Brae was buried in sand
for thousands of years

27:38.239 --> 27:42.451
until a great storm
uncovered it in 1850.

27:42.451 --> 27:45.454
Now known
as the Scottish Pompeii,

27:45.454 --> 27:47.289
it was home to the people

27:47.289 --> 27:49.959
who began Britain's
stone circle building boom,

27:49.959 --> 27:51.961
ultimately built Stonehenge,

27:51.961 --> 27:56.383
and then mysteriously vanished
from the genetic record.

27:56.383 --> 27:59.719
Right. Site's over here.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.304
Well, it's quite amazing

28:01.304 --> 28:03.722
that this place
was completely covered

28:03.722 --> 28:05.266
with sand,

28:05.266 --> 28:08.019
uh, until they refound it
in the 19th century.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.730
The people who built
the first stone circle

28:10.730 --> 28:13.566
a couple of miles from here
lived here.

28:13.566 --> 28:16.152
Yeah. Just look at this place.

28:16.152 --> 28:19.029
I mean, it's just extraordinary.

28:19.029 --> 28:20.448
PHILLIPS:
It's pretty sophisticated.

28:20.448 --> 28:22.032
I mean, these walls here

28:22.032 --> 28:25.369
are really quite advanced
for 5,000 years ago,

28:25.369 --> 28:28.038
when everybody else
in the country was living in,

28:28.038 --> 28:29.874
well, mud huts, basically.

28:29.874 --> 28:32.919
I know. And-and the incredible
thing about this is

28:32.919 --> 28:35.838
the descendants of these people
end up creating

28:35.838 --> 28:38.674
all of the stone circles
around Britain.

28:38.674 --> 28:40.468
How do you think this started?

28:40.468 --> 28:44.263
I-I think something was changing
in the minds of these people.

28:44.263 --> 28:45.682
But, you know,
the bigger question is,

28:45.682 --> 28:47.683
what were they doing here?

28:47.683 --> 28:51.354
NARRATOR:
Experts believe that
the descendants of Skara Brae

28:51.354 --> 28:53.981
began building
the great stone circles

28:53.981 --> 28:56.401
that ultimately led
to Stonehenge.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.487
To see the first
of these mighty circles,

28:59.487 --> 29:03.407
Andrew and Graham
travel six miles south.

29:03.407 --> 29:06.411
So, we're going now
to the Stones of Stenness,

29:06.411 --> 29:10.248
which is the first stone circle,
that we know of,

29:10.248 --> 29:13.125
built anywhere
in the British Isles.

29:15.127 --> 29:17.755
It originally consisted of

29:17.755 --> 29:20.008
12 stones in a circle

29:20.008 --> 29:23.760
around 100 feet in diameter,

29:23.760 --> 29:27.265
and the stones
are up to 16 feet high.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.852
COLLINS:
What's so incredible

29:30.852 --> 29:34.271
is that this first stone circle
in Britain

29:34.271 --> 29:36.148
has a relationship

29:36.148 --> 29:40.987
with Gobekli Tepe
in southeast Turkey, which--

29:40.987 --> 29:43.573
because the Stones of Stenness

29:43.573 --> 29:45.325
is aligned to the stars.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.201
To the south,

29:47.201 --> 29:50.622
it's the rising
of the stars of Orion.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.624
And to the north,

29:52.624 --> 29:56.752
it is the setting
of the stars of Cygnus.

29:56.752 --> 30:00.339
And the very same constellations
feature

30:00.339 --> 30:03.343
within astronomical alignments
at Gobekli Tepe,

30:03.343 --> 30:06.637
thousands of miles away.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.808
NARRATOR:
If the Stones of Stenness,

30:11.808 --> 30:14.394
like Gobekli Tepe, Stonehenge,

30:14.394 --> 30:16.605
and other megalithic structures,

30:16.605 --> 30:19.942
was constructed in such a way
as to be in alignment

30:19.942 --> 30:23.278
with astronomical events, why?

30:23.278 --> 30:27.115
Was it to merely function
as a type of calendar,

30:27.115 --> 30:30.744
indicating when to plant crops
or perform rituals?

30:32.204 --> 30:35.208
Or were these structures
oriented to the stars

30:35.208 --> 30:37.042
for a far more profound

30:37.042 --> 30:40.755
or perhaps extraterrestrial
purpose?

30:42.131 --> 30:45.218
It is true
that-that Stonehenge can be used

30:45.218 --> 30:47.470
or was used as a calendar.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.346
There is no doubt about it.

30:49.346 --> 30:53.351
However,
in order to create a calendar,

30:53.351 --> 30:56.563
there was absolutely zero need

30:56.563 --> 31:01.651
to build a megalithic structure
as gigantic as Stonehenge.

31:01.651 --> 31:04.903
'Cause you could have recreated
the entire same thing

31:04.903 --> 31:10.117
by, essentially, placing
ordinary sticks in the ground.

31:10.117 --> 31:12.578
That was not the case.

31:12.578 --> 31:14.788
So what was it?

31:14.788 --> 31:18.792
POPE:
There is a knowledge
and purpose here,

31:18.792 --> 31:21.003
and it's-it's sophisticated.

31:21.003 --> 31:24.840
Were ceremonies and rituals

31:24.840 --> 31:27.676
conducted there that
actually achieved something?

31:27.676 --> 31:30.637
In other words,
is, in one sense,

31:30.637 --> 31:34.267
Stonehenge a device, a machine?

31:34.267 --> 31:36.935
MARTINEAU:
This geometry is there
right from the beginning

31:36.935 --> 31:38.813
of the stone circle building

31:38.813 --> 31:41.898
and the reason they were
choosing these shapes

31:41.898 --> 31:45.361
was something to do
with astronomy.

31:45.361 --> 31:48.865
And I think it's some kind
of interesting technology,

31:48.865 --> 31:51.409
ancient technology, um,

31:51.409 --> 31:53.577
whose origins are lost
in the mist of time.

31:54.621 --> 31:55.997
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

31:55.997 --> 31:57.999
that the builders
of ancient stone circles

31:57.999 --> 32:01.919
weren't constructing
giant celestial calendars,

32:01.919 --> 32:05.964
but, instead, were using the sun
and stars as guides

32:05.964 --> 32:08.425
so that the giant stones
they were using

32:08.425 --> 32:10.428
could be precisely placed?

32:10.428 --> 32:15.016
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

32:15.016 --> 32:18.019
the answer is a profound yes.

32:18.019 --> 32:22.481
And they believe the precise
astrological placements of these

32:22.481 --> 32:25.817
weren't intended
for ritual purposes,

32:25.817 --> 32:29.113
but for technological ones,
possibly as a means

32:29.113 --> 32:31.199
of conducting and generating

32:31.199 --> 32:34.201
a type of geo-electrical energy.

32:35.619 --> 32:37.663
So the people who built this,

32:37.663 --> 32:40.208
you think, were inspired
by the descendants

32:40.208 --> 32:42.376
of those who built
Gobekli Tepe.

32:42.376 --> 32:43.795
I'm certain of it.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.713
But as we know,

32:46.713 --> 32:48.758
this is the beginning

32:48.758 --> 32:53.429
of something brand-new
that starts here

32:53.429 --> 32:58.558
on the Orkney mainland
and continues to Stonehenge.

32:58.558 --> 33:00.811
So what comes next?

33:02.980 --> 33:05.857
NARRATOR:
Just down the road
from the Stones of Stenness

33:05.857 --> 33:08.361
lies the Ring of Brodgar.

33:08.361 --> 33:12.323
The third largest stone circle
in the British Isles,

33:12.323 --> 33:16.576
it is a hotbed of UFO sightings
and activity.

33:16.576 --> 33:19.372
According to ancient astronaut
theorists,

33:19.372 --> 33:22.375
it could also hold the key
to solving the mystery

33:22.375 --> 33:25.044
of why the Stonehenge builders
suddenly

33:25.044 --> 33:29.715
and inexplicably... disappeared.

33:36.722 --> 33:38.932
POPE:
Were the ancients mimicking

33:38.932 --> 33:42.854
ancient astronaut theorist
Andrew Collins

33:42.854 --> 33:44.771
and author Graham Phillips

33:44.771 --> 33:46.481
are investigating stone circles

33:46.481 --> 33:50.278
that are believed to be
even older than Stonehenge.

33:50.278 --> 33:53.990
They have just arrived
at the Ring of Brodgar,

33:53.990 --> 33:57.160
which is not only
an important historical site

33:57.160 --> 34:00.454
but also a hot spot
for UFO sightings.

34:00.454 --> 34:04.791
PHILLIPS:
We're here
at the Ring of Brodgar.

34:04.791 --> 34:06.626
It is a henge circle,
so all around

34:06.626 --> 34:09.630
the outside of it is
a ditch and embankment.

34:09.630 --> 34:13.925
COLLINS:
And one of the things
that's been repeatedly found

34:13.925 --> 34:16.679
in connection with stone circles

34:16.679 --> 34:19.931
is that there's a very special
geology associated

34:19.931 --> 34:22.351
with the landscape around them.

34:22.351 --> 34:26.438
And all of these seem to be able

34:26.438 --> 34:28.775
to manifest mysterious lights.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.360
And they almost appear to act

34:31.360 --> 34:34.655
like windows onto another realm.

34:34.655 --> 34:37.324
Because as you get higher,

34:37.324 --> 34:41.036
you can see that the whole place
is like a perfect circle.

34:41.036 --> 34:44.331
A perfect hole
out of this reality

34:44.331 --> 34:46.833
into another realm all together.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.753
So this place here
could actually be

34:49.753 --> 34:53.757
some kind of portal
between this world and another?

34:53.757 --> 34:55.217
Precisely.

34:55.217 --> 34:57.302
But what's so incredible

34:57.302 --> 35:00.806
is that at virtually
every location

35:00.806 --> 35:04.351
that this megalithic culture
moved out

35:04.351 --> 35:07.355
is also somewhere associated
with the appearance

35:07.355 --> 35:11.233
of mysterious lights,
what we'd call UFOs.

35:11.233 --> 35:14.778
We're talking about Stonehenge,

35:14.778 --> 35:16.114
Avebury,

35:16.114 --> 35:18.865
the Isle of Anglesey in Wales,

35:18.865 --> 35:21.786
and the area
around the Rod Stone.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.954
All of these locations

35:23.954 --> 35:25.831
are what we would call portals,

35:25.831 --> 35:29.043
places where
mysterious lights appear

35:29.043 --> 35:31.838
and then disappear.

35:31.838 --> 35:35.173
NARRATOR:
Is it possible
that ancient stone circles

35:35.173 --> 35:38.427
found throughout the world
were once used as portals

35:38.427 --> 35:40.679
to other parts
of the universe?

35:40.679 --> 35:44.266
And could this explain
why the builders of Stonehenge

35:44.266 --> 35:47.269
suddenly disappeared
from the DNA record,

35:47.269 --> 35:51.023
right after the structure is
believed to have been completed?

35:51.023 --> 35:54.985
While such a notion may sound
preposterous to some,

35:54.985 --> 35:57.195
ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

35:57.195 --> 36:00.407
that it is far from impossible.

36:00.407 --> 36:03.786
NEWMAN: They realized
that these stone circles

36:03.786 --> 36:06.371
actually do manipulate
earth energies,

36:06.371 --> 36:09.208
these currents that are part
of the magnetic field.

36:09.208 --> 36:12.085
CHILDRESS:
Archaeologists now

36:12.085 --> 36:15.172
are speculating
that the blue stones

36:15.172 --> 36:19.175
that are part
of the Stonehenge complex,

36:19.175 --> 36:24.056
they are a type
of black-blue dolerite

36:24.056 --> 36:29.603
that has very bright nodes
of quartz in them.

36:31.313 --> 36:33.106
NARRATOR:
Quartz is able to convert

36:33.106 --> 36:35.693
the earth's natural
electrical vibrations

36:35.693 --> 36:37.445
into a form of energy.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.989
The amount of energy increases

36:39.989 --> 36:42.742
when the quartz
is under pressure,

36:42.742 --> 36:46.161
as it would be as part of a
massive monolithic structure

36:46.161 --> 36:48.246
like Stonehenge.

36:48.246 --> 36:50.081
NEWMAN:
So you have electrical qualities

36:50.081 --> 36:52.418
when the quartz
is kind of crushed

36:52.418 --> 36:54.503
and then you have magnetic
qualities as well

36:54.503 --> 36:55.838
within the same stone.

36:55.838 --> 36:57.340
So this could have been used

36:57.340 --> 37:01.469
to manipulate
earth energy currents.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.221
CHILDRESS:
Many of the stone circles

37:03.221 --> 37:06.222
have something to do with
astronomical alignments,

37:06.222 --> 37:09.434
and you have to wonder if
it's a way of calculating

37:09.434 --> 37:12.938
and having a calibration
that you can use

37:12.938 --> 37:15.858
to create a special portal area.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.443
It's got a special energy,
perhaps,

37:18.443 --> 37:20.528
that's being manipulated

37:20.528 --> 37:24.032
and created
by these megalithic structures.

37:24.032 --> 37:27.619
NARRATOR:
Did the builders of ancient
megalithic structures

37:27.619 --> 37:30.081
like Stonehenge
and Gobekli Tepe,

37:30.081 --> 37:32.250
use their advanced knowledge

37:32.250 --> 37:34.668
of the interconnectivity
between the Earth--

37:34.668 --> 37:38.005
and the ability of precisely
placed megalithic stones--

37:38.005 --> 37:41.759
to generate energy
to create portals?

37:41.759 --> 37:44.302
And could this be
why they decided

37:44.302 --> 37:46.389
to quarry the rock
for Stonehenge

37:46.389 --> 37:49.391
from 120 miles away,

37:49.391 --> 37:52.353
because they needed
a particular type of rock

37:52.353 --> 37:54.730
with a particular
quartz concentration?

37:54.730 --> 37:57.942
If so,
could their incredible ability

37:57.942 --> 38:00.860
to create energy be
an indication

38:00.860 --> 38:04.280
that their origins might be
extraterrestrial?

38:04.280 --> 38:06.992
If the Nephilim were actually

38:06.992 --> 38:09.744
some sort
of extraterrestrial race

38:09.744 --> 38:13.666
with super high technology,
then maybe

38:13.666 --> 38:16.085
now all the high-tech stuff
is gone

38:16.085 --> 38:20.338
and all that's left
is this skeletal structure

38:20.338 --> 38:22.090
that we call Stonehenge.

38:22.090 --> 38:24.969
NARRATOR:
If the builders of Stonehenge

38:24.969 --> 38:27.012
really did create a portal

38:27.012 --> 38:29.472
through which they returned
to the home planet

38:29.472 --> 38:31.809
of their extraterrestrial
ancestors,

38:31.809 --> 38:35.896
did that portal close
after they left?

38:35.896 --> 38:38.648
Or was the site stripped
of its power

38:38.648 --> 38:42.068
when the original structure
was deconstructed?

38:42.068 --> 38:45.030
Perhaps the answer can be found

38:45.030 --> 38:47.615
by examining one of the
strangest events to occur

38:47.615 --> 38:50.119
at Stonehenge in modern times.

38:50.119 --> 38:54.039
An event that some believe
may contain a message

38:54.039 --> 38:56.041
from another world.

39:02.172 --> 39:03.715
NARRATOR:
Wiltshire, England.

39:03.715 --> 39:06.510
July 1996.

39:06.510 --> 39:09.054
One of the most complex

39:09.054 --> 39:12.391
and spectacular crop circle
designs ever seen

39:12.391 --> 39:15.561
appears in a field
opposite Stonehenge.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.896
POPE:
The so-called Julia Set

39:17.896 --> 39:20.775
appeared right next
to Stonehenge.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.777
Now, the Julia Set
takes its name

39:23.777 --> 39:28.615
from a fractal,
which is a mathematical shape.

39:28.615 --> 39:33.079
This was intricate, complex.

39:34.204 --> 39:36.331
There's an interesting story

39:36.331 --> 39:38.333
that apparently a taxi driver

39:38.333 --> 39:40.878
saw this formation

39:40.878 --> 39:44.422
just appearing suddenly,
magically,

39:44.422 --> 39:47.802
as if some unseen hidden force

39:47.802 --> 39:49.804
was making the pattern.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.889
Some people have said
that they were symbols

39:52.889 --> 39:55.809
that are meant
to convey information.

39:55.809 --> 39:58.521
And it's the conveying
of information

39:58.521 --> 40:01.148
that I think
is the important thing here.

40:01.148 --> 40:03.400
That really might be the key

40:03.400 --> 40:05.610
to unlocking the mystery here.

40:05.610 --> 40:09.280
NARRATOR:
Could it be that
the incredible crop formation

40:09.280 --> 40:11.742
that appeared next to Stonehenge

40:11.742 --> 40:14.869
was a message
from extraterrestrial visitors?

40:14.869 --> 40:18.623
If Stonehenge was built
as a portal to the stars,

40:18.623 --> 40:21.751
can this technology
be reactivated?

40:21.751 --> 40:25.213
And might the mathematical
information contained

40:25.213 --> 40:27.757
within the Julia Set
provide the key

40:27.757 --> 40:29.802
to reopening the portal?

40:31.594 --> 40:33.264
CHILDRESS:
When we look at Stonehenge,

40:33.264 --> 40:35.266
we have to wonder
about the energy there.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.894
So, early on, it becomes a site
where things are happening,

40:39.894 --> 40:42.731
extraterrestrials
are landing here perhaps.

40:42.731 --> 40:46.318
But it all starts
with some activity early on

40:46.318 --> 40:48.320
in this, in this special place.

40:50.155 --> 40:52.615
People speculated
that the ancients

40:52.615 --> 40:56.452
were able to perceive power,

40:56.452 --> 40:59.914
Earth energies,
mysterious forces

40:59.914 --> 41:02.126
that perhaps modern humans

41:02.126 --> 41:04.836
have lost the ability
to perceive.

41:04.836 --> 41:09.007
Maybe, the theory is, that we've
got smarter in other ways,

41:09.007 --> 41:11.385
but we've lost
a certain something,

41:11.385 --> 41:13.304
the ability to perhaps tap into

41:13.304 --> 41:16.097
these ancient power sites.

41:19.726 --> 41:22.188
NARRATOR:
Does a megalithic stone circle

41:22.188 --> 41:25.398
standing alone
in the English countryside

41:25.398 --> 41:28.318
represent the remains of the
most sophisticated technology

41:28.318 --> 41:31.322
to ever exist on Earth?

41:31.322 --> 41:35.034
A technology which was part
of a vast global network

41:35.034 --> 41:37.661
of similar structures
that were not only capable

41:37.661 --> 41:40.581
of generating
vast amounts of energy,

41:40.581 --> 41:43.208
but also the means
by which alien visitors

41:43.208 --> 41:46.045
could both arrive and depart?

41:46.045 --> 41:48.880
Perhaps the stones
that still remain

41:48.880 --> 41:50.423
were deliberately left standing

41:50.423 --> 41:53.052
so that humankind
would one day restore

41:53.052 --> 41:54.719
this lost technology...

41:54.719 --> 41:57.097
reactivate it...

41:57.097 --> 42:00.851
and ultimately reunite
with the ancient builders

42:00.851 --> 42:03.603
who still exist...

42:03.603 --> 42:06.440
light-years away.
