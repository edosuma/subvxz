WEBVTT

00:10.905 --> 00:14.207
Probably a lot of different deaths,
a lot of violent deaths.

00:14.209 --> 00:17.177
It just seems like it's
getting worse for everyone.

00:17.179 --> 00:19.579
He says, "Those [bleep] got to go."

00:19.581 --> 00:21.715
He shoots himself with the same rifle

00:21.717 --> 00:23.250
that killed his stepdaughter.

00:23.252 --> 00:24.835
That's a twist.

00:24.837 --> 00:27.621
Someone said, "That's the room of death."

00:27.623 --> 00:30.624
My son whispered, he says,
"That's a bad guy."

00:30.626 --> 00:32.392
Would you say they're a threat?

00:33.528 --> 00:38.198
Something wiped everybody out.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.867
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:40.869 --> 00:43.270
My name is Amy Allan.

00:43.272 --> 00:46.173
What's happening?

00:46.175 --> 00:47.274
I see dead people.

00:47.276 --> 00:49.709
It seems like a devil.

00:49.711 --> 00:51.411
I speak to dead people.

00:51.413 --> 00:53.079
He's pissed off.

00:53.081 --> 00:54.514
And they speak to me.

00:54.516 --> 00:56.149
I felt real fear.

00:56.151 --> 00:59.619
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:59.621 --> 01:01.188
I think she's being murdered.

01:01.190 --> 01:02.511
I rely on my partner.

01:02.711 --> 01:04.328
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:04.330 --> 01:05.996
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:05.998 --> 01:07.731
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:07.733 --> 01:11.301
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:11.303 --> 01:12.502
Nobody believes me.

01:12.504 --> 01:13.937
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.939 --> 01:16.239
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:16.241 --> 01:17.974
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.976 --> 01:20.010
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:20.012 --> 01:21.211
...until the very end.

01:21.213 --> 01:22.879
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:22.881 --> 01:25.165
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:25.167 --> 01:27.250
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

01:27.252 --> 01:28.518
Or time to get out.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.588
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:48.690 --> 01:50.691
I'm in Sumpter, Oregon.

01:50.693 --> 01:53.694
It's a small mountain town about
two hours from Boise, Idaho.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.712
Now, we got called in by a couple

01:55.714 --> 01:58.465
that live and work in a B&B in town.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.817
They want to turn the
business over to their son,

02:00.819 --> 02:03.920
but the activity's gotten so
violent and physical lately,

02:03.922 --> 02:05.839
they don't know what to do,
and they're worried.

02:05.841 --> 02:08.091
They sound scared and
desperately want us to find

02:08.092 --> 02:10.426
a way to keep the B&B in the family.

02:19.520 --> 02:24.207
Before Amy arrives,
I look for any leading information.

02:24.209 --> 02:26.927
Photographs, antiques, and personal items

02:26.929 --> 02:29.246
can influence her findings.

02:29.248 --> 02:33.417
So it's important I
cover or remove them all.

02:33.419 --> 02:36.686
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:51.352 --> 02:56.339
There is a lot of physical pain here.

02:56.341 --> 02:59.476
My whole head hurts a lot,

02:59.478 --> 03:03.447
and there's a lot of dead people here.

03:05.583 --> 03:11.054
They all died horribly
and I would say violently.

03:19.163 --> 03:21.248
Barb, I'm glad to be here.

03:21.250 --> 03:24.251
This is beautiful place,
but you got a problem here.

03:24.253 --> 03:26.253
Yeah. We love the place.

03:26.255 --> 03:29.039
We've had it for 17 years,

03:29.041 --> 03:32.042
and we've always had little things happen,

03:32.044 --> 03:33.627
but it just seems like

03:33.629 --> 03:37.147
it's getting worse for our guests,
for everyone.

03:37.149 --> 03:40.016
Now, Barb, as far as activity goes,
what are we talking about?

03:40.018 --> 03:42.269
We hear noises that we can't explain,

03:42.271 --> 03:45.088
things are moved,

03:45.090 --> 03:46.873
people feel sick.

03:46.875 --> 03:48.842
And now it's getting really physical.

03:48.844 --> 03:50.126
People are being touched.

03:50.128 --> 03:52.195
I'm just concerned, you know, because we...

03:52.197 --> 03:53.830
Like I say, it's our home first,

03:53.832 --> 03:55.649
and you want to be happy in your home.

03:55.651 --> 03:58.101
And then when we have people come in,

03:58.103 --> 04:01.288
we want to feel that they
are safe and secure here.

04:01.290 --> 04:04.708
What do you know about the
history of the building itself?

04:04.710 --> 04:09.196
That it opened in May of 1900
as Sumpter General Hospital.

04:09.198 --> 04:11.214
- So this was a hospital?
- Mm-hmm.

04:11.216 --> 04:12.215
That was what it was built for.

04:12.217 --> 04:13.466
Okay.

04:13.468 --> 04:15.585
You're looking to retire and
turn this over to your son,

04:15.587 --> 04:17.170
- is that right?
- Yeah, that was the idea.

04:20.257 --> 04:22.792
And he's got two little kids.

04:22.794 --> 04:24.528
I just...

04:24.530 --> 04:28.598
I want to make sure that
they're safe when they're here.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.034
- How attached are you to this place?
- I love it.

04:31.036 --> 04:33.203
I guess we just really thought,

04:33.205 --> 04:35.789
"Oh, that building just needs to be"...

04:39.427 --> 04:41.344
"Needs some love and attention."

04:47.318 --> 04:50.270
What the hell?

04:50.272 --> 04:52.822
There's quite a few dead women here.

04:54.959 --> 05:00.564
They seem to be from a while ago,

05:00.566 --> 05:06.636
maybe 1890...

05:06.638 --> 05:09.906
like 1905?

05:09.908 --> 05:14.277
One of the ladies is the representative

05:14.279 --> 05:19.015
and head honcho of these other four women.

05:23.020 --> 05:26.656
I don't know why they got stuck here.

05:26.658 --> 05:30.160
They didn't die all at the same time.

05:33.197 --> 05:35.065
There's a man.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.533
Mm.

05:36.535 --> 05:39.235
He doesn't look good. He's a little old man.

05:39.237 --> 05:42.439
He's mean. He is ornery.

05:42.441 --> 05:44.057
Ow.

05:44.059 --> 05:49.946
He definitely can make
physical contact with people.

05:49.948 --> 05:51.781
He's pinching and poking.

05:53.852 --> 05:55.418
I don't like him.

05:59.824 --> 06:01.591
Okay, what's going on in here?

06:01.593 --> 06:03.994
We keep hearing loud bangs,

06:03.996 --> 06:07.113
like an encyclopedia,
heavy book being dropped flat

06:07.115 --> 06:08.331
on a wooden floor.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.749
And we'd get up. We were in bed.

06:09.751 --> 06:11.551
We'd get up, and we look all around.

06:11.553 --> 06:13.420
We don't see anything that made a noise.

06:13.422 --> 06:15.055
And what about guests?

06:15.057 --> 06:16.356
No, there were no guests.

06:16.358 --> 06:17.657
Well, this is a B&B.

06:17.659 --> 06:19.326
You sure nobody came in
to try to get a room?

06:19.328 --> 06:21.544
There wasn't anything.
I mean, we both looked.

06:21.546 --> 06:23.580
Anything else in this room?

06:23.582 --> 06:24.831
Yes. One day,

06:24.833 --> 06:26.683
these doors were propped
open like they are right now.

06:26.685 --> 06:27.851
Okay.

06:27.853 --> 06:31.871
I'm in the other room,
hear a noise, come out here,

06:31.873 --> 06:34.791
and this picture is lying facedown

06:34.793 --> 06:37.594
right here on the floor.

06:40.448 --> 06:42.999
It would have had to come
up and over and down.

06:43.001 --> 06:44.167
Okay, so when you...

06:44.169 --> 06:45.702
It was just a couple minutes before,

06:45.704 --> 06:47.671
you saw the doors like this.
Yes, yeah, yeah.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.005
And that picture was...

06:49.007 --> 06:50.874
Was lying facedown right there.

06:50.876 --> 06:53.326
Now, any guests?

06:53.328 --> 06:54.327
No guests.

06:54.329 --> 06:55.528
So nobody else was in the building?

06:55.530 --> 06:56.629
No one.

06:56.631 --> 06:58.682
I can't even figure out,

06:58.684 --> 07:01.267
unless it fell and came through here,

07:01.269 --> 07:03.620
but even that's pushing it.

07:03.622 --> 07:05.572
I can't even figure out how to debunk that.

07:05.574 --> 07:09.693
Now, have any guests had issues
with things moving on their own?

07:09.695 --> 07:12.328
A lot of guests have experienced that.

07:12.330 --> 07:14.497
Their glasses. Okay.

07:14.499 --> 07:15.949
Kick their shoes off here

07:15.951 --> 07:18.418
and find them over there the next morning.

07:18.420 --> 07:20.370
That's bizarre.

07:21.572 --> 07:26.076
The old man, he's tired of these women.

07:26.078 --> 07:30.063
He's trying to keep them out of the house,

07:30.065 --> 07:33.083
but it's not working,

07:33.085 --> 07:35.719
and I think he really hates the lead one.

07:35.721 --> 07:38.955
They've had fights,

07:38.957 --> 07:42.058
and it's affected their environment.

07:42.060 --> 07:45.195
Some objects moved or thrown.

07:45.197 --> 07:47.497
And, like, the electricity

07:47.499 --> 07:51.568
definitely was affected in those situations.

07:59.326 --> 08:00.577
I spoke with your wife.

08:00.579 --> 08:01.778
Mm-hmm.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.713
And she was telling me
about some of the things

08:03.715 --> 08:05.115
you got going on here.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.616
It seems like you got a bit of a problem.

08:06.618 --> 08:09.419
The increased activity in
the last couple of years,

08:09.421 --> 08:11.421
especially in the last few months,

08:11.423 --> 08:13.873
has given me some concern.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.125
Has it hurt business?

08:15.127 --> 08:17.560
In recent months,
there have been three or four times

08:17.562 --> 08:19.195
where, in room six,

08:19.197 --> 08:20.363
somebody has sensed

08:20.365 --> 08:22.949
that somebody had crawled
into bed with them.

08:22.951 --> 08:27.003
And in one case, I had a young lady up there

08:27.005 --> 08:30.757
who said the next morning that,
whatever it was,

08:30.759 --> 08:33.393
was breathing in her ear,
and it startled her.

08:33.395 --> 08:36.011
She woke up, and she yelled.

08:36.014 --> 08:39.381
What if that had been
somebody that had a bad ticker

08:39.384 --> 08:42.352
and was fairly old, you know?

08:42.354 --> 08:44.637
What kind of experience are
you having in the house?

08:44.639 --> 08:47.524
Electrical problems drive me crazy.

08:47.526 --> 08:50.643
Lights going on and off by themselves,

08:50.645 --> 08:52.829
timers going off.

08:52.831 --> 08:54.247
What about the wiring?

08:54.249 --> 08:56.132
Wiring's all brand-new.

08:56.134 --> 08:58.034
Have you seen anything else,
heard anything else?

08:58.036 --> 08:59.169
Yeah.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.588
A friend of mine and I
were here in the kitchen,

09:01.590 --> 09:03.773
and looking up here...

09:03.775 --> 09:06.676
and I can only see it from the knees down...

09:06.678 --> 09:09.679
something or someone came down the stairs.

09:09.681 --> 09:11.681
There wasn't anybody in here,

09:11.683 --> 09:14.134
and the back door was locked upstairs.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.486
Okay, so you guys go up there
and check it out, though?

09:16.488 --> 09:18.121
- Yeah.
- Nothing.

09:18.123 --> 09:20.223
There's nobody there.

09:20.225 --> 09:21.758
Amy once in a while will tell people this...

09:21.760 --> 09:23.626
"You got a serious problem
that's gonna get a lot worse.

09:23.628 --> 09:25.161
You need to get the hell out of here."

09:25.163 --> 09:28.097
What would you think if you heard that?

09:28.099 --> 09:30.850
Blood, sweat, and tears for 17 years

09:30.852 --> 09:32.735
have gone into this place.

09:32.737 --> 09:37.490
Yeah, so it would be really
hard to just walk away from it.

09:37.492 --> 09:39.125
Okay.

09:39.127 --> 09:42.428
Can the living see this angry man?

09:42.430 --> 09:45.348
Yes, and he looks creepy.

09:45.350 --> 09:47.517
His face is a horrible mess.

09:47.519 --> 09:50.937
It's like if he took ash

09:50.939 --> 09:54.073
and was trying to re-create his face.

09:54.075 --> 09:56.526
Ohh, I feel dizzy.

09:56.528 --> 09:58.528
I don't feel good.

09:58.530 --> 10:01.197
He's hurting living people.

10:27.686 --> 10:29.787
So, Brian,
I was taing to your mom and dad,

10:29.789 --> 10:31.338
and your mom was expressing concerns

10:31.340 --> 10:33.557
about your kids being here.

10:33.559 --> 10:36.510
Do you have the same concerns?

10:36.512 --> 10:40.564
My son comes here,
and he's seeing imaginary people,

10:40.566 --> 10:42.428
and he doesn't see them at my house.

10:42.528 --> 10:44.444
He even refers to them as "the bad people."

10:44.446 --> 10:46.646
Putting him down for a nap,

10:46.648 --> 10:48.131
and he points over at
the chair in the corner,

10:48.133 --> 10:53.987
and in a very different voice,
he says, "That's a bad guy."

10:53.989 --> 10:57.057
Needless to say, it was just ominous.

10:57.059 --> 10:58.925
So what about you as far as experiences go?

10:58.927 --> 11:00.377
I have had one.

11:00.379 --> 11:04.531
I was in my room,
and the bed that I'm on started shaking.

11:04.533 --> 11:07.534
I actually thought, "Oh, earthquake?"

11:07.536 --> 11:09.736
Jumped off the bed, looked, still shaking,

11:09.738 --> 11:12.439
and nothing else in the house was moving.

11:12.441 --> 11:14.841
Well,
how big of a shake are we talking about?

11:14.843 --> 11:18.428
I was getting moved,
so it was like, you know, moving.

11:18.430 --> 11:19.946
- That hard?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:19.948 --> 11:21.882
So, I know your mom's got cats.

11:21.884 --> 11:24.735
I literally looked to see if there was,
like, a cat that crawled up underneath,

11:24.737 --> 11:26.420
and there isn't even a space under there,

11:26.422 --> 11:27.537
so it's not possible.

11:29.073 --> 11:32.092
I don't want it around.
I don't want my kids around it.

11:32.094 --> 11:34.461
I don't want to have to
talk about that with them.

11:39.667 --> 11:43.170
I don't like it in here.

11:47.508 --> 11:52.112
These women come in here,
and they're all dressed in black.

11:52.114 --> 11:54.681
I don't like them back here.

11:54.683 --> 11:58.518
They're not the same as
when they're downstairs.

11:58.520 --> 12:02.022
These women are creepy, man.

12:04.525 --> 12:07.360
This could be what the old
man was talking about...

12:10.198 --> 12:16.536
But I think him trying
to get rid of these women

12:16.538 --> 12:21.241
might ultimately not be such a bad thing.

12:21.243 --> 12:24.878
He very much has the attitude of,

12:24.880 --> 12:27.113
"This is my house." You know what I mean?

12:27.115 --> 12:28.982
"And those [bleep] got to go."

12:37.692 --> 12:39.326
Kari, I understand

12:39.328 --> 12:41.194
you're actually staying in the
hotel tonight in this room.

12:41.196 --> 12:42.395
I am.

12:42.397 --> 12:44.531
Okay, is this the first
time you're staying here?

12:44.533 --> 12:46.800
No, I've stayed here two other times.

12:46.802 --> 12:48.468
Kari, have you had any experiences

12:48.470 --> 12:49.503
while you've been here?

12:49.505 --> 12:53.073
I've seen a woman about three times.

12:53.075 --> 12:57.444
The first night I stayed here,
I woke up, and there was a woman.

12:57.446 --> 13:02.399
To me, she just looked like a
black figure walking around.

13:02.401 --> 13:05.435
So I fell back to sleep,

13:05.437 --> 13:07.621
and I woke up to turn over on my bed,

13:07.623 --> 13:09.689
and there was that same dark figure

13:09.691 --> 13:11.992
actually sitting on the side of this bed

13:11.994 --> 13:16.471
and looking into the mirror
and brushing her hair.

13:16.571 --> 13:18.905
Were you boozing that night?
Were you drinking?

13:18.907 --> 13:19.273
No.

13:19.308 --> 13:22.092
Okay, so you said you saw her three times.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.144
When was the third?

13:24.146 --> 13:25.512
The third was actually last night

13:25.514 --> 13:26.680
when I stayed in this room.

13:26.682 --> 13:28.882
- Last night?
- Yeah.

13:28.884 --> 13:30.751
I was looking up towards the wall,

13:30.753 --> 13:34.187
and the next thing you know,
there's a skeleton face.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.522
You're just frozen.

13:35.524 --> 13:39.359
You don't know what to say,
or you can't scream.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.511
You can't do anything.

13:41.513 --> 13:43.347
Why do you come back?

13:43.349 --> 13:45.115
It brings up curiosity.

13:45.117 --> 13:49.303
You want to come here and see
if anything's gonna happen.

13:49.305 --> 13:52.706
I doubt that anything is gonna happen to me.

13:55.109 --> 14:01.448
They've been busted in
this room, the ladies...

14:01.450 --> 14:05.786
Like, somebody waking up in here

14:05.788 --> 14:10.857
and catching them doing [bleep] to the,
you know, person.

14:10.859 --> 14:16.096
'Cause I keep seeing this
one thing over and over again.

14:16.098 --> 14:18.298
Like, them surrounding the
bed with the people in it.

14:18.300 --> 14:21.084
And they would definitely have that feeling

14:21.086 --> 14:24.104
of, like, they couldn't move,
they couldn't talk,

14:24.106 --> 14:28.025
they can't breathe.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.046
So it sounds like you're experiencing a lot.

14:33.048 --> 14:34.815
I mean, anything else happening?

14:34.817 --> 14:37.484
Since I got in this house,
I just felt drained.

14:37.486 --> 14:38.735
I got, like, physically ill.

14:38.737 --> 14:40.537
Describe what you mean by ill.

14:40.539 --> 14:43.924
Like, you felt like you were
just about ready to throw up.

14:43.926 --> 14:47.911
When I got into his room, I just felt tired.

14:47.913 --> 14:50.330
I felt like I had just been drugged.

14:50.332 --> 14:53.283
You can hardly breathe
when you get into here.

14:55.837 --> 14:57.921
And the women are definitely

14:57.923 --> 15:01.007
feeding off of any living people around.

15:01.009 --> 15:04.878
They move through, like, in a pack,

15:04.880 --> 15:07.647
and then they just kind of feed.

15:10.618 --> 15:15.922
They're definitely taking
energy away from living people.

15:15.924 --> 15:18.258
How would that affect the living?

15:18.260 --> 15:24.998
If the person woke up while
the ladies were doing it,

15:25.000 --> 15:31.571
then they would feel like
they couldn't move and stuff.

15:31.573 --> 15:36.410
But if they don't,
then they would feel really awful.

15:36.412 --> 15:37.994
Would you say they're a threat?

15:37.996 --> 15:39.446
Mm-hmm.

15:39.448 --> 15:42.399
If you were exposed to this consistently,

15:42.401 --> 15:45.085
you'd probably have a heart attack

15:45.087 --> 15:47.337
or develop severe issues.

16:04.057 --> 16:05.624
This is a small town.

16:05.626 --> 16:07.960
It only has a couple
hundred people living in it,

16:07.962 --> 16:10.629
so it didn't take me long to
track down a local historian.

16:10.631 --> 16:13.398
She tells me that Jay and Barb's B&B

16:13.400 --> 16:15.651
has a long and dramatic history.

16:23.977 --> 16:27.312
So, you had mentioned that the
building I'm investigating,

16:27.314 --> 16:29.715
that's now a B&B, had a dramatic history.

16:29.717 --> 16:30.983
Yes, it has.

16:30.985 --> 16:33.585
And my client thinks it
opened up as a hospital.

16:33.587 --> 16:34.953
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

16:34.955 --> 16:37.823
JB Stoddard, and there's a picture of him,

16:37.825 --> 16:41.376
he and his wife, Esther,
bought the property in 1899,

16:41.378 --> 16:45.630
and then they built a hospital,
and it opened in June of 1900.

16:45.632 --> 16:49.701
And it operated as a hospital until 1917.

16:49.703 --> 16:51.420
Now, do you know anything about this guy?

16:51.520 --> 16:53.987
He was definitely a very smart businessman.

16:53.989 --> 16:55.606
He was born in Utah,

16:55.608 --> 16:59.793
and he and his family were
in the lumber industry there,

16:59.795 --> 17:01.445
and he came here, started a mill.

17:01.447 --> 17:03.881
Most of the buildings in Sumpter

17:03.883 --> 17:05.582
were built with lumber from his mills.

17:05.584 --> 17:09.653
Now, did he own the hospital
the entire time it was open?

17:09.655 --> 17:12.239
No, he sold out in 1903.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.025
He sold to a couple of the
doctors who worked there.

17:15.027 --> 17:17.895
Okay. All right.

17:17.896 --> 17:19.346
Now, what eventually happened to him?

17:19.348 --> 17:21.915
He passed away in 1925.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.685
There's a copy of his death certificate.

17:27.055 --> 17:29.907
He died of dementia. He was 68.

17:32.760 --> 17:37.481
This grumpy old man confuses me.

17:37.483 --> 17:40.684
I think he owned this at one point.

17:40.686 --> 17:43.186
Do you get an age for him?

17:43.188 --> 17:48.191
He's... Gosh, like 70s.

17:48.193 --> 17:53.030
Doesn't look like he died very well.

17:53.032 --> 17:56.400
Skin and bone.

17:56.402 --> 17:59.236
Definitely mentally unsound.

17:59.238 --> 18:02.739
He's very frail.

18:02.741 --> 18:10.614
Maybe he has Alzheimer's or something.

18:12.450 --> 18:14.384
You blink, you go through this town.

18:14.386 --> 18:16.353
Why would they build a hospital here?

18:16.355 --> 18:18.789
At that time, this was quite a metropolis.

18:18.791 --> 18:20.958
There were about 4,500 people here.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.910
Really?

18:22.912 --> 18:25.929
Here's a picture that
shows Sumpter at its peak.

18:25.931 --> 18:30.233
It shows the wood streets,
the Capital Hotel.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.569
Then going up the street, that's the school.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.271
Okay, this white building here?

18:34.273 --> 18:35.555
Right.

18:35.557 --> 18:37.574
And then next to it is what
was the hospital at that time.

18:37.576 --> 18:40.277
We had all kinds of miners

18:40.279 --> 18:42.229
and then all the supporting industries

18:42.231 --> 18:43.480
that go along with that.

18:43.482 --> 18:45.515
Okay, now,
what kind of mines we talking about?

18:45.517 --> 18:46.683
- Gold mines.
- Gold.

18:46.685 --> 18:48.752
Yes, so there were cave-ins,

18:48.754 --> 18:50.971
crushing injuries, and those kinds of things

18:50.973 --> 18:53.523
where a hospital was definitely needed.

18:53.525 --> 18:56.560
Now, did the townspeople use the hospital,
as well?

18:56.562 --> 18:57.728
Yes, they did.

18:57.730 --> 19:00.364
There were people that had
all kinds of injuries...

19:00.366 --> 19:03.200
burns from house fires, horseback injuries,

19:03.202 --> 19:06.169
flu epidemics, moms having babies.

19:06.171 --> 19:07.904
So that hospital covered everything?

19:07.906 --> 19:09.806
Absolutely.

19:12.543 --> 19:16.413
Oh, God, the head pain is ridiculous.

19:16.415 --> 19:18.799
Ridiculous, ridiculous.

19:20.986 --> 19:22.519
Do you know what it's from?

19:22.521 --> 19:27.224
Well, people being hit in the head.

19:31.997 --> 19:34.097
I don't know what's happening.

19:34.099 --> 19:38.802
There's been a lot of loss here, you know...

19:38.804 --> 19:41.822
women having miscarriages.

19:43.941 --> 19:45.375
Uh...

19:45.377 --> 19:46.777
What?

19:48.513 --> 19:52.349
There's a big old blood stain on the floor.

19:52.351 --> 19:55.018
I can't make it go away.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.386
How large is it?

19:56.388 --> 19:59.139
It's pretty [bleep] Somebody bled out.

20:00.942 --> 20:04.528
Quite a lot of people,
quite a lot of different deaths,

20:04.530 --> 20:06.396
a lot of violent deaths.

20:06.398 --> 20:08.932
Who the [bleep] knows what happened there,

20:08.934 --> 20:12.302
but there is something there.

20:19.577 --> 20:25.332
There's someone throwing up a lot, crying,

20:25.334 --> 20:28.468
and they're dying 'cause they're sick.

20:31.090 --> 20:33.190
Ow.

20:34.792 --> 20:38.695
You said the hospital
closed down in 1917. Why?

20:38.697 --> 20:41.348
There was a fire in August of 1917

20:41.350 --> 20:45.335
that destroyed nearly all of
the business area in Sumpter.

20:47.438 --> 20:49.673
Wow.

20:49.675 --> 20:53.960
I'd say 99.9% of the businesses
and quite a few residences

20:53.962 --> 20:55.846
were destroyed.

20:55.848 --> 21:00.517
And then this shows the
destruction after the fire.

21:01.986 --> 21:03.820
Wow.

21:03.822 --> 21:06.857
Those were two of the
bigger buildings in town,

21:06.859 --> 21:09.276
and it just totally destroyed them.

21:09.278 --> 21:11.211
Did the B&B I'm investigating get hit?

21:11.213 --> 21:12.212
No, it didn't.

21:12.214 --> 21:14.397
It was right on the edge of the fire.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.349
Now, do we know how it started?

21:16.351 --> 21:18.401
It started at the Capital Hotel,

21:18.403 --> 21:21.438
and the it spread quickly
'cause of the wood streets.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.173
Oh, geez.

21:23.175 --> 21:24.908
Did people die in this fire?

21:24.910 --> 21:27.327
There is one article that speaks to the fact

21:27.329 --> 21:30.080
that two miners were killed.

21:32.400 --> 21:36.119
Okay, so the fire happens in 1917,

21:36.121 --> 21:38.989
and it stops being a hospital,
so what happens after that?

21:38.991 --> 21:43.293
It became the Masonic
Hall in 1918 until 1973.

21:43.295 --> 21:45.796
After the fire, the town never recovered.

22:02.613 --> 22:07.717
It's really strange because I...
I see it more crowded.

22:07.719 --> 22:10.954
It looks different.

22:15.510 --> 22:23.800
Like I'm actually seeing more of a town,
I guess.

22:24.869 --> 22:26.703
Okay.

22:26.705 --> 22:30.590
There's like a wooden, like,
sidewalk or something.

22:30.592 --> 22:33.443
Like, they're just kind of showing me,

22:33.445 --> 22:35.445
like, things were good,

22:35.447 --> 22:39.282
and then, uh...

22:39.284 --> 22:43.386
a few things happened to stop that.

22:43.388 --> 22:45.422
What do you mean?

22:45.424 --> 22:48.358
Something wiped everybody out.

23:05.899 --> 23:08.468
So far, I've got a town
that was nearly wiped out by a fire

23:08.470 --> 23:10.573
and a property that was once a hospital

23:10.673 --> 23:12.222
where countless people died,

23:12.224 --> 23:14.158
but I need to see if there's anything else.

23:15.910 --> 23:17.044
Searching through the archives,

23:17.046 --> 23:18.912
I discovered the hospital's first patient

23:18.914 --> 23:20.814
is a miner named Fred Kane.

23:21.783 --> 23:25.369
Turns out, he went crazy and
brutally murdered a 4-year-old

23:25.371 --> 23:27.688
before turning the gun on himself.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.560
Obviously, I want to know
more about this case,

23:33.562 --> 23:35.596
so I've called a local police chief,

23:35.598 --> 23:37.731
and he agreed to look into it for me.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.203
Well, Chief Lohner, thanks for meeting me.

23:43.205 --> 23:44.638
I appreciate that.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.106
The Fred Kane murder case,

23:46.108 --> 23:48.309
you were able to look into it for me.

23:48.311 --> 23:49.192
What were you able to find out?

23:49.292 --> 23:51.659
I found that Fred Kane,
he was a miner up in the Sumpter area.

23:51.661 --> 23:53.895
He actually had went to that hospital

23:53.897 --> 23:57.865
that you're investigating
back on June 12th of 1900.

23:57.867 --> 23:59.400
He was actually the first
patient of the hospital

23:59.402 --> 24:03.437
after being kicked by a horse
up at the Montezuma Mine.

24:04.756 --> 24:06.841
So, this is before the murder.

24:06.843 --> 24:08.042
It is.

24:08.044 --> 24:10.411
A few months later, on September 19th,

24:10.413 --> 24:11.579
up at the family cabin

24:11.581 --> 24:13.781
where Fred Kane lived with his wife, Naomi,

24:13.783 --> 24:16.083
and her 4-year-old daughter,
his stepdaughter,

24:16.085 --> 24:18.052
a young gal by the name of Ruth Toney,

24:18.054 --> 24:22.006
Fred... He took his Winchester
rifle and left the residence.

24:22.008 --> 24:24.025
And when Fred came back into the cabin,

24:24.027 --> 24:26.127
he fired a round from his Winchester,

24:26.129 --> 24:28.629
and that actually shot through Ruth

24:28.631 --> 24:31.299
and entered the body of Naomi at the time.

24:31.301 --> 24:36.554
The child is dead instantly by
every report that we could find.

24:36.556 --> 24:39.163
- Okay, what happens next?
- Fred picked up a club,

24:39.198 --> 24:41.246
and he started beating Naomi with the club,

24:41.248 --> 24:43.352
and then, all of a sudden,
he stopped beating her,

24:43.452 --> 24:44.846
and he looked at her, and he said,

24:44.946 --> 24:46.779
"You got blood on your dress."

24:46.781 --> 24:48.448
So this guy's a whack job.

24:48.450 --> 24:50.775
You know, see, there had been no
indication of any mental illness

24:50.875 --> 24:52.963
with Fred Kane prior to this occurrence,

24:53.063 --> 24:55.997
but he obviously was suffering
from some type of mental delusion

24:55.999 --> 24:57.999
at the time if you believe Naomi's accounts.

24:58.001 --> 24:59.534
Now, what does she do?

24:59.536 --> 25:01.536
She told him that there
had been another assailant

25:01.538 --> 25:03.438
in the residence that had shot her

25:03.440 --> 25:05.273
and that's where the blood came from,

25:05.275 --> 25:07.576
and she said he just ran out into the woods.

25:07.578 --> 25:09.255
And so Fred took off out the door.

25:09.355 --> 25:11.355
She then fled the cabin
as soon as he was gone,

25:11.357 --> 25:13.524
and she went to a nearby
cabin where she was located

25:13.526 --> 25:15.326
by two workers that had been in the area.

25:15.328 --> 25:17.829
He came back to the residence,
saw Naomi was gone,

25:17.831 --> 25:19.697
saw the child lifeless on the floor,

25:19.699 --> 25:21.332
and he set the cabin on fire.

25:21.334 --> 25:23.584
And in the meantime,

25:23.586 --> 25:25.703
he takes off and runs
to his brother's cabin,

25:25.705 --> 25:27.455
which is just a short distance away,

25:27.457 --> 25:30.091
lights it on fire,

25:30.093 --> 25:32.243
and the report indicates
that he shoots himself

25:32.245 --> 25:34.011
with the same rifle that
killed his stepdaughter.

25:34.013 --> 25:35.313
Geez.

25:35.315 --> 25:38.349
He shoots himself in the chest,
but he actually survives.

25:38.351 --> 25:41.085
He ultimately ended up at
Sumpter General Hospital

25:41.087 --> 25:42.286
just two hours later

25:42.288 --> 25:44.989
after Naomi had been admitted
to the same hospital.

25:44.991 --> 25:49.994
Okay, so both of them wind up in
the location I'm investigating

25:49.996 --> 25:52.196
but when it was a hospital?

25:52.198 --> 25:53.931
Correct. Both with gunshot wounds.

25:53.933 --> 25:57.835
Fred ultimately died of his
injuries on October 10th.

25:57.837 --> 25:59.787
Okay, now, what happens to Naomi?

25:59.789 --> 26:02.006
She ultimately was
released from the hospital,

26:02.008 --> 26:04.258
and she ended up up in Portland,

26:04.260 --> 26:06.878
where she actually died
exactly six years to the day

26:06.880 --> 26:08.129
of the original shooting.

26:08.131 --> 26:11.015
She died on September 19, 1906.

26:11.017 --> 26:12.884
She was 35 years old at the time.

26:12.886 --> 26:15.219
Kind of the irony on this, with the theory

26:15.221 --> 26:18.589
that Fred was insane at
the time of the shooting,

26:18.591 --> 26:22.260
was that she died by what
the medical examiners report,

26:22.262 --> 26:25.229
the death certificate states
is a general collapse,

26:25.231 --> 26:28.149
the contributing factor being insanity.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.567
You're kidding me.

26:29.569 --> 26:31.152
No.

26:31.154 --> 26:32.570
Well, that's a twist.

26:36.441 --> 26:43.281
There's a couple of the
women who are extremely depressed.

26:43.283 --> 26:48.119
Like, if they were still alive,
they would be suicidal,

26:48.121 --> 26:52.156
you know, that's how depressed they are.

26:52.158 --> 26:55.993
One of them lost her whole family,

26:55.995 --> 27:00.998
and she still feels that,
like, it happened that day.

27:01.000 --> 27:08.639
She can't move beyond that loss.

27:16.515 --> 27:19.784
I encountered several
dead people on my walk.

27:19.786 --> 27:23.271
But the woman surrounding
a man asleep in his bed

27:23.273 --> 27:25.439
had me the most concerned.

27:25.441 --> 27:30.861
There's about five women who
are at the foot of the bed

27:30.863 --> 27:33.464
staring at this man.

27:33.466 --> 27:37.702
And at the center is a dominant female.

27:37.704 --> 27:42.873
She has dark brown hair, dark brown eyes,

27:42.875 --> 27:45.610
thin, arched eyebrows.

27:45.612 --> 27:52.550
She has a high-collared,
black, very plain dress on.

27:54.953 --> 27:56.003
Is this what you saw?

27:56.005 --> 27:59.257
Yes, that's what I saw.

28:22.510 --> 28:25.212
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:25.214 --> 28:27.347
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

28:27.349 --> 28:29.733
and our clients for the first time.

28:31.019 --> 28:34.288
Amy, I'd like you to meet Barb and Jay.

28:34.290 --> 28:35.529
They're a married couple,

28:35.629 --> 28:38.997
and they live and run this place
as a B&B for the last 17 years.

28:38.999 --> 28:41.667
They've always had activity,

28:41.669 --> 28:44.953
but recently, it's gotten out of control.

28:44.955 --> 28:48.307
They're looking to pass
this on to their son,

28:48.309 --> 28:49.775
who has two beautiful children.

28:49.777 --> 28:52.144
Oh.

28:52.146 --> 28:54.313
The problem is, they're really not sure

28:54.315 --> 28:56.915
if it's safe to keep this
business in the family.

28:56.917 --> 29:00.969
Now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on here,

29:00.971 --> 29:03.355
she's gonna tell us about her walk.

29:03.357 --> 29:07.993
This was a really difficult walk for me,

29:07.995 --> 29:10.829
feeling, you know, really physically ill.

29:10.831 --> 29:13.398
Actually up there... top-10 worst.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.900
Wow.

29:14.902 --> 29:18.170
There's a lot of sickness here.

29:18.172 --> 29:23.675
As soon as I got out of the car,
it was like chaos ensued,

29:23.807 --> 29:28.477
and a lot of, you know,
dead people were freaking out.

29:28.479 --> 29:34.249
A lot of them that I encountered
outside had died horribly.

29:34.251 --> 29:38.053
Necks were broken,
heads were just bashed in.

29:38.055 --> 29:43.158
And the head and the neck pain
that I felt out there from them

29:43.160 --> 29:46.528
continued all throughout the walk.

29:46.530 --> 29:51.533
And then I went upstairs
and saw a lot of sickness.

29:51.535 --> 29:54.903
I saw a woman who had a miscarriage,

29:54.905 --> 29:59.107
a huge bloodstain on the floor,

29:59.109 --> 30:01.426
and then another woman
in one of the bedrooms

30:01.428 --> 30:02.761
who seemed to be very ill.

30:02.763 --> 30:06.064
Like, sweat and vomiting and all of that.

30:06.066 --> 30:10.018
You know, that's an easyone to answer.

30:10.020 --> 30:12.671
This building was built in 1900
but not as a bed-and-breakfast.

30:12.673 --> 30:13.889
It was built as a hospital.

30:13.891 --> 30:15.423
- What?
- Yeah.

30:15.425 --> 30:17.259
Oh, my gosh. Oh.

30:17.261 --> 30:22.414
The thing was,
it operated as a hospital from 1900 to 1917.

30:22.416 --> 30:25.567
Back in that time,
there was 4,500 people living here.

30:25.569 --> 30:26.635
Okay, okay.

30:26.637 --> 30:27.836
This was a mining town.

30:27.838 --> 30:29.671
When you talked about head injuries

30:29.673 --> 30:31.089
and all this other stuff.

30:31.091 --> 30:35.644
So these guys were killed by cave-ins,
explosions.

30:35.646 --> 30:38.013
I got a stack of articles

30:38.015 --> 30:39.881
talking about all these
injuries that happened here,

30:39.883 --> 30:42.050
and they were all brought to this hospital.

30:42.052 --> 30:44.886
Matter of fact,
this was the hospital for the whole town.

30:44.888 --> 30:48.123
Oh, that makes sense.

30:48.125 --> 30:51.443
A mining town would explain
probably the physical injuries.

30:51.445 --> 30:55.413
And this being used as a
hospital explains the illness.

30:56.732 --> 30:58.884
So, what else did you get?

30:58.886 --> 31:01.002
There are about five or six women.

31:01.004 --> 31:02.971
They kind of travel as a pack.

31:02.973 --> 31:06.007
They're definitely from around 1890, 1905.

31:06.009 --> 31:09.110
One of the women was all dressed in black

31:09.112 --> 31:10.679
and seemed to be mourning.

31:10.681 --> 31:14.216
She definitely seems to be
the leader of the group.

31:14.218 --> 31:18.470
They all died at different
times from various illnesses.

31:18.472 --> 31:20.839
Does that make sense
'cause it was a hospital here?

31:20.841 --> 31:22.173
Well, now it does, yeah.

31:22.175 --> 31:24.025
Let me ask you a question
about the women that are here.

31:24.027 --> 31:25.293
Do you think they can be seen?

31:25.295 --> 31:29.097
I definitely think that the
main lady presents herself.

31:29.099 --> 31:31.800
Jay, tell her what you saw that day.

31:32.785 --> 31:35.203
Well, I was in the kitchen,
and out of the corner of my eye,

31:35.205 --> 31:37.973
glanced up here on that staircase,

31:37.975 --> 31:40.809
and something came down,

31:40.811 --> 31:44.379
and I could see its legs
from maybe the knees down.

31:44.381 --> 31:45.947
What did the legs look like?

31:45.949 --> 31:47.315
Shadows.

31:47.317 --> 31:48.934
Mm-hmm, okay.

31:48.936 --> 31:51.453
There were two women from this group

31:51.455 --> 31:54.556
that were extremely depressed.

31:54.558 --> 31:57.642
The living would probably
feel this depression

31:57.644 --> 31:59.894
because it's so thick.

31:59.896 --> 32:03.098
One of the women lost
her whole family at once,

32:03.100 --> 32:06.601
and she can't get over it.

32:06.603 --> 32:12.641
She seems hopeless and lost,
crying all the time,

32:12.643 --> 32:15.343
suicidal, even though she's dead.

32:15.345 --> 32:18.363
She lost her entire family in one day?

32:18.365 --> 32:19.497
Yeah.

32:19.499 --> 32:21.182
Now, there's one woman that comes to mind

32:21.184 --> 32:22.934
that ended up here when it was a hospital

32:22.936 --> 32:24.519
that had a very traumatic experience.

32:24.521 --> 32:27.922
Her name was Naomi Kane,
and her husband, Fred Kane,

32:27.924 --> 32:30.925
was actually the first
patient in this hospital

32:30.927 --> 32:33.161
when he got kicked by a horse.

32:33.163 --> 32:35.864
Now, on September 19th that same year,

32:35.866 --> 32:38.266
Naomi was holding her 4-year-old daughter

32:38.268 --> 32:40.635
from a previous marriage in her arms.

32:40.637 --> 32:43.938
Fred came into the house with
a rifle and shot at them.

32:44.974 --> 32:48.576
The bullet went through the baby,
killed her,

32:48.578 --> 32:51.246
and then went into Naomi.

32:51.248 --> 32:54.866
Somehow she escapes and gets
taken to the hospital here.

32:54.868 --> 32:56.468
Fred, in the meantime,

32:56.470 --> 32:59.854
lights the house that they lived
in on fire and shoots himself,

32:59.856 --> 33:01.940
but he survived.

33:01.942 --> 33:03.525
Somebody found him,

33:03.527 --> 33:05.393
and they brought him to this hospital,
as well.

33:05.395 --> 33:07.762
He wound up dying about three weeks later.

33:07.764 --> 33:13.118
Six years to the day after the shooting,

33:13.120 --> 33:15.170
she dies at the young age of 35.

33:15.172 --> 33:17.572
The official cause of death
on her death certificate says

33:17.574 --> 33:20.608
general collapse from insanity.

33:20.610 --> 33:23.445
How do you die from insanity?

33:23.447 --> 33:24.596
I think she committed suicide, to be honest.

33:24.598 --> 33:26.014
That's what I'm thinking, too.

33:26.016 --> 33:27.082
Seems to fit.

33:27.084 --> 33:28.883
Do you have any sense that

33:28.885 --> 33:31.286
she may be one of those women?

33:31.288 --> 33:33.121
Yeah.

33:37.026 --> 33:40.695
Then I met this interesting character.

33:40.697 --> 33:41.730
He was in the back over here.

33:41.732 --> 33:43.365
That's their bedroom.

33:44.550 --> 33:47.035
He kind of was throwing attitude,

33:47.037 --> 33:50.472
definitely grumpy,
kind of crotchety older man.

33:50.474 --> 33:53.992
He was probably in his 70s.

33:53.994 --> 33:56.127
He felt like this place belonged to him,

33:56.129 --> 34:00.598
so I was thinking he either
owned it or he lived here.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.984
He definitely didn't have a good death.

34:02.986 --> 34:07.522
His face was not in good shape.

34:07.524 --> 34:08.806
And then, he, like, runs up,

34:08.809 --> 34:10.775
and he starts, like,
pinching me and poking me.

34:10.777 --> 34:13.128
Barb, can you explain to Amy

34:13.130 --> 34:16.431
what your son and your grandson
experienced in one of the rooms?

34:16.433 --> 34:18.600
Yes. He was putting him down for a nap,

34:18.601 --> 34:20.802
and so he was lying on the bed with him,

34:20.804 --> 34:23.036
and the grandson pointed at a chair,

34:23.039 --> 34:24.989
and there wasn't anybody in the chair,

34:24.991 --> 34:28.092
but then he said, "That's the bad guy."

34:29.210 --> 34:31.513
You mention you think he owned the place?

34:31.514 --> 34:32.914
Yeah.

34:32.916 --> 34:35.699
Well, the original owner is a guy,
James Stoddard,

34:35.702 --> 34:39.587
that had businesses in town with the lumber.

34:39.589 --> 34:40.621
He had this place for like three years,

34:40.623 --> 34:41.956
and he sold it to some doctors.

34:41.958 --> 34:44.359
He knew they needed a hospital here,
and he built it.

34:44.360 --> 34:47.429
You said the guy was in his 70s.

34:47.431 --> 34:49.230
This guy died at the age of 68.

34:49.232 --> 34:52.516
You mention he had a horrible death.

34:52.518 --> 34:54.168
This guy actually died from dementia.

34:55.771 --> 35:00.308
So more than likely,
this is the guy, the same...

35:00.310 --> 35:01.776
- Sounded like it.
- Sure seems like it.

35:01.778 --> 35:02.944
Yeah.

35:02.946 --> 35:05.146
- Mischievous, yeah.
- Mischievous old codger.

35:05.148 --> 35:06.147
Yes.

35:06.149 --> 35:07.449
Mm.

35:07.451 --> 35:09.784
It doesn't surprise me that
this man is still here,

35:09.786 --> 35:11.853
as the dead often come back to the place

35:11.855 --> 35:14.205
which had the most meaning in their lives.

35:15.241 --> 35:19.494
There's a lot of stuff going on
between him and the dead women.

35:19.496 --> 35:22.447
He does not like them at all.

35:22.449 --> 35:25.467
He said that this is his house

35:25.469 --> 35:28.052
and that those [bleep] need to go.

35:28.054 --> 35:30.922
There's been about five or six times

35:30.924 --> 35:34.042
where him and the main
lady got into a fight,

35:34.044 --> 35:37.962
and I saw, like,
physical things happening around them

35:37.964 --> 35:39.864
because of this exchange.

35:39.866 --> 35:43.985
Specifically, I saw,
like, electrical issues.

35:43.987 --> 35:46.571
And this is only when they're fighting.

35:46.573 --> 35:48.807
That explains a lot of things, right?

35:48.809 --> 35:50.024
Yes, it does.

35:50.026 --> 35:53.628
Upstairs, the TV going on and off by itself,

35:53.630 --> 35:56.915
lights going on and off by themselves.

35:56.917 --> 35:58.833
There's nobody to turn it on.

35:58.835 --> 36:01.970
And does this happen often?

36:01.972 --> 36:03.521
- Recently, yes.
- Last little while.

36:03.523 --> 36:06.357
We really don't want anyone
to just get frightened to...

36:06.359 --> 36:10.311
I mean, to have a health issue because of...

36:10.313 --> 36:12.664
You got a legitimate issue here.

36:14.667 --> 36:17.819
Initially, I didn't like the older man,

36:17.821 --> 36:22.207
and then I went upstairs
and saw the women up there,

36:22.209 --> 36:24.592
and it was a very different story.

36:25.277 --> 36:27.145
Are they different women, or...?

36:27.147 --> 36:28.913
No, it's the same women.

36:28.915 --> 36:31.583
Up there, what they were doing

36:31.585 --> 36:34.485
was taking the energy from the living.

36:34.487 --> 36:35.720
Yeah.

36:36.956 --> 36:40.325
And they just all stand around the bed

36:40.327 --> 36:42.861
and literally are just, like,
almost breathing it in.

36:42.863 --> 36:45.930
The main woman does know what she's doing.

36:45.932 --> 36:48.483
And she's doing it to sustain herself.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.703
I spoke to one of your guests

36:51.705 --> 36:53.304
that was staying here that night I was here.

36:53.306 --> 36:55.306
She said she just felt like the whole energy

36:55.308 --> 36:57.609
just got sucked right out of her.

36:57.611 --> 37:01.229
We've had guests on more than one occasion

37:01.231 --> 37:05.900
that have sensed somebody
sitting on the edge of the bed,

37:05.902 --> 37:07.285
crawling into bed with them.

37:07.287 --> 37:09.404
That's exactly what's going on.

37:11.657 --> 37:13.608
I did a sketch

37:13.610 --> 37:16.961
of what people may encounter
when they're in the bed.

37:31.844 --> 37:33.878
Yeah.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.614
That's really frightening.

37:36.616 --> 37:39.450
I mean, anybody that comes here... the kids,
the grandkids...

37:39.452 --> 37:43.705
I don't want them to be
afraid to go upstairs.

37:59.780 --> 38:02.115
I did do a sketch

38:02.117 --> 38:06.636
of what people may encounter
when they're in the bed.

38:23.904 --> 38:25.305
Yeah.

38:25.307 --> 38:28.274
That's really frightening.

38:28.276 --> 38:31.528
I mean, anybody that comes here... the kids,
the grandkids...

38:31.530 --> 38:35.832
I don't want them to be
afraid to go upstairs.

38:40.254 --> 38:42.522
<i>I</i> don't want to be afraid to go upstairs.

38:42.524 --> 38:46.993
You know, it would be nice
if the family could continue

38:46.995 --> 38:52.474
to come here and live here
and be happy and safe...

38:52.574 --> 38:54.357
Mm-hmm.

38:54.359 --> 38:57.577
...for them to love this
place as much as I do.

39:00.198 --> 39:02.365
Your son Brian told me
a story about the bed.

39:02.367 --> 39:04.284
Mm-hmm.

39:04.286 --> 39:06.837
He was awake in bed,

39:06.839 --> 39:11.725
and, all of a sudden,
the bed started to shake.

39:11.727 --> 39:14.077
Okay.

39:14.079 --> 39:15.362
When he described it to me, I mean...

39:15.364 --> 39:16.413
It was shaking.

39:16.415 --> 39:18.448
That could be her.

39:23.788 --> 39:28.792
She's strong, and she can be
very physical and very forceful.

39:28.794 --> 39:33.630
If somebody irks her,
she definitely will let them know.

39:33.632 --> 39:36.166
But if you're exposed to that consistently

39:36.168 --> 39:37.734
over a long period of time,

39:37.736 --> 39:41.855
it can cause serious
illnesses and heart issues

39:41.857 --> 39:43.773
and things like that.

39:43.775 --> 39:46.776
Wow.

39:50.948 --> 39:54.084
You know, you don't want to
pass something like this on

39:54.086 --> 39:55.418
to your son and grandchildren.

39:55.420 --> 40:01.258
No, I wouldn't do that until
this issue is resolved.

40:02.577 --> 40:04.828
How do we stop her?

40:06.264 --> 40:08.098
We want to put a stop to it.

40:12.771 --> 40:14.688
Well, guys,
I know this has been a lot tonight,

40:14.690 --> 40:16.806
but at least you know what's going on.

40:16.808 --> 40:19.392
The big question is,
can you stay here safely

40:19.394 --> 40:22.112
and pass it on to your
family like you want to?

40:22.114 --> 40:25.148
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

40:25.150 --> 40:27.317
Okay.

40:27.319 --> 40:31.388
So, first off, there needs to
be a pastor who's brought in,

40:31.390 --> 40:36.092
and this individual needs to do a blessing

40:36.094 --> 40:41.765
and needs to tell the women
and the other lost souls to go.

40:41.767 --> 40:44.184
And this needs to be a
direct order from him.

40:44.186 --> 40:47.270
It needs to be firm.

40:47.272 --> 40:50.140
What this will do is,

40:50.142 --> 40:55.111
all of the women will leave,
and the older man will leave.

40:55.113 --> 40:57.480
The second thing is,

40:57.482 --> 41:02.702
you need a person who is a Reiki
master and does home cleansings,

41:02.704 --> 41:04.754
so that's a healer,

41:04.756 --> 41:09.826
to come in and do a cleansing
of the whole location,

41:09.828 --> 41:11.861
and that's gonna get rid of, like,

41:11.863 --> 41:14.864
all of the residual illness and trauma

41:14.866 --> 41:17.584
that's been kind of absorbed here.

41:17.586 --> 41:19.686
And that'll get rid of all that stuff

41:19.688 --> 41:21.004
that's here with the hospital?

41:21.006 --> 41:22.038
Yeah.

41:26.494 --> 41:28.445
You look like you feel like...

41:28.447 --> 41:30.146
I am so relieved.

41:30.148 --> 41:33.650
Are you gonna take Amy's advice?

41:33.652 --> 41:35.235
Yes, yes. Absolutely.

41:35.237 --> 41:37.554
It's got to make you feel good

41:37.556 --> 41:39.589
you could keep this place in the family now.

41:39.591 --> 41:41.157
Yes. Absolutely.

41:43.811 --> 41:45.695
It's a happy cry.

41:47.965 --> 41:50.900
It won't be easy
removing the layers of dead

41:50.902 --> 41:52.902
inside this location.

41:52.904 --> 41:56.239
But with the help of a
pastor and a Reiki master,

41:56.241 --> 41:58.074
the dead will be set free.

41:58.076 --> 41:59.676
And I believe Jay and Barb

41:59.678 --> 42:01.561
can pass down their bed-and-breakfast

42:01.563 --> 42:03.613
to future generations.
