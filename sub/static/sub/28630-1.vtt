00:12.296 --> 00:13.630
<i>You sure no one's around?</i>

00:13.713 --> 00:15.630
<i>This is perfect. No witnesses.</i>

00:15.713 --> 00:16.880
<i>Okay, tap into the feed.</i>

00:22.005 --> 00:22.838
<i>Cool.</i>

00:22.921 --> 00:26.880
<i>Okay. This is temporal relocation
test number 103.</i>

00:26.963 --> 00:29.296
<i>The date is June 27th, 2019,</i>

00:29.380 --> 00:32.463
<i>and this is our third test
on our Temporal Relocation Pack Mark Ones</i>

00:32.546 --> 00:34.130
<i>or, as I like to call them, TRPs.</i>

00:37.963 --> 00:40.130
<i>This is the finalized TRP Mark One.</i>

00:40.963 --> 00:43.338
<i>We have officially finished
the time sequence calibrations</i>

00:43.421 --> 00:45.921
<i>for the core of the TRP,
which is located here.</i>

00:46.171 --> 00:48.755
<i>In this canister,
there is a solution of protons.</i>

00:48.963 --> 00:51.130
<i>The canister is attached
to a rotor circuit</i>

00:51.213 --> 00:53.213
<i>that generates the protons
to the speed of light,</i>

00:53.296 --> 00:56.755
<i>which will then create
a quantum foam and open up a wormhole.</i>

00:58.463 --> 00:59.921
Once the wormhole opens,

01:00.171 --> 01:03.921
the protons and the energy generated
will break down our molecular structure,

01:04.004 --> 01:05.444
so we can pass through the wormhole,

01:05.630 --> 01:07.463
so we can get to our time destination

01:07.546 --> 01:09.880
with our molecular structure
fully reconstructed.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.713
- Hopefully!
- It will!

01:13.005 --> 01:14.213
Okay. Make it zoom in.

01:16.130 --> 01:18.421
This is where
we'll put in our time coordinates

01:18.505 --> 01:21.171
and where we'll monitor
the stability of the wormhole.

01:21.255 --> 01:24.713
Our TRPs only harness enough power
to go back one full day into the past,

01:24.796 --> 01:28.838
so we'll go back to yesterday,
4:26 p.m., June 26th, 2019.

01:30.005 --> 01:31.796
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

01:35.130 --> 01:37.130
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.

01:38.088 --> 01:39.630
Oh, boy. All right.

01:42.963 --> 01:46.088
Ten... nine... eight...

01:46.171 --> 01:49.005
Oh, and we don't measure time
by our concept of time.

01:49.088 --> 01:50.380
- We measure it by the...
- CJ!

01:50.463 --> 01:51.880
- Uh-huh. Mm-mm.
- Wha...

01:51.963 --> 01:52.963
Okay. Sorry.

01:53.005 --> 01:54.005
Five...

01:54.213 --> 01:55.213
four...

01:55.546 --> 01:56.546
three...

01:56.880 --> 01:57.880
two...

01:58.088 --> 01:59.130
energize!

01:59.213 --> 02:00.380
This isn't <i>Star Trek.</i>

02:00.463 --> 02:02.046
Shut the fuck up.

02:05.963 --> 02:07.921
- Whoa! I think it's working.
- Oh!

02:28.046 --> 02:29.255
Oh, shit!

02:40.005 --> 02:41.005
Well, that went well.

02:43.463 --> 02:44.630
Sebastian, what the f...

02:46.255 --> 02:48.963
<i>♪ No, no no ♪</i>

02:50.421 --> 02:56.755
<i>♪ You don't love me

03:02.296 --> 03:05.546
<i>♪ No, no, no ♪</i>

03:36.088 --> 03:37.088
Shh.

03:37.505 --> 03:38.505
Shh.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.213
Okay, have a great summer

03:59.296 --> 04:02.005
and, uh, don't forget
the science expo starts July 5th...

04:02.755 --> 04:05.005
Go to the beach. Coney Island.

04:05.671 --> 04:06.796
Mr. Lockhart.

04:11.463 --> 04:13.623
Miss Walker, you wanted to talk
about the science expo?

04:13.671 --> 04:17.005
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about our end-of-the-year presentation.

04:18.213 --> 04:19.213
What about it?

04:19.713 --> 04:21.588
We wanted to use
the presentation for the expo.

04:22.005 --> 04:23.005
B+?

04:24.005 --> 04:25.921
<i>B+ is not the end of the world.</i>

04:26.005 --> 04:28.338
<i>B+ is not good for judges, though, either.</i>

04:28.421 --> 04:30.661
<i>I think you need
to reach a little higher.</i>

04:30.713 --> 04:31.793
<i>Reach a little higher?</i>

04:31.838 --> 04:34.546
<i>You gave Eduardo an A+
for his stupid circuit boards.</i>

04:34.630 --> 04:37.005
<i>Our calculations indicated the behavior</i>

04:37.088 --> 04:39.213
of an electronically neutral
point mass that...

04:39.296 --> 04:41.963
Let me ask you a question.
Why are you participating in the expo?

04:42.338 --> 04:44.505
Full ride to MIT. Hello!

04:44.588 --> 04:47.005
Oh, and Bash wants to go
to Morehouse, scholarships...

04:47.088 --> 04:49.588
You and Mr. Thomas
are the smartest kids in this school.

04:50.755 --> 04:52.213
Don't tell anybody I said that.

04:53.796 --> 04:55.213
But you're missing the big picture.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.463
If time travel were possible,

04:58.130 --> 05:01.213
it would be the greatest ethical
and philosophical conundrum

05:01.296 --> 05:02.421
of the modern age.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.880
If you had that kind of power...

05:06.421 --> 05:07.588
what would you do?

05:08.296 --> 05:09.671
What would you change?

05:16.546 --> 05:17.963
CJ, hey. Uh,

05:18.046 --> 05:20.005
are you still tight
about the presentation?

05:20.088 --> 05:23.088
- Come on. We'll kill 'em next year.
- Thank you, Mr. Thomas.

05:23.546 --> 05:25.755
Uh, if you guys wanna work
on your college applications,

05:25.838 --> 05:28.171
I'm here for you.
That's more important right now.

05:28.255 --> 05:29.671
- Cool.
- Cool.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.296
Oh, oh, and guys,

05:31.380 --> 05:32.380
guys...

05:33.255 --> 05:35.088
Whatever it is you took from the lab,

05:35.171 --> 05:36.838
just bring it back in one piece.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.046
Okay.

05:40.213 --> 05:42.713
- Have a great summer.
- You too.

05:44.546 --> 05:45.588
Time travel.

05:46.796 --> 05:48.088
Great Scott.

05:55.796 --> 05:58.880
Nice going, genius.
We just made Mr. Lockhart an accomplice.

06:00.380 --> 06:02.231
- Messing with...
- Where y'all think y'all going?

06:02.255 --> 06:03.255
Jesus!

06:03.630 --> 06:07.171
Ooh, I see you two
went shopping in the lab! Ooh.

06:07.255 --> 06:09.796
You decided whether you're coming
down to Puerto Rico with me?

06:09.880 --> 06:12.255
My <i>abuela's </i> church is goin'
for the hurricane relief effort.

06:12.338 --> 06:14.171
It'd be dope if you came. It's in August.

06:14.255 --> 06:17.005
Yeah. All right. I'll ask my grandma
if I can make it. All right?

06:17.088 --> 06:19.838
You know, you can come down, too,
if you want.

06:21.421 --> 06:24.463
She's just upset with me because
I can't fit her in my schedule for a date.

06:24.838 --> 06:28.296
You know, what can I say?
I'm popular with the shorties!

06:28.630 --> 06:31.356
You're the last person
I'd go on a date with. You can trust that.

06:31.380 --> 06:32.380
Whatever.

06:32.463 --> 06:35.046
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:35.171 --> 06:37.546
So, y'all gonna tell me
what the equipment's for?

06:38.630 --> 06:40.546
Oh, okay!

06:41.213 --> 06:43.921
I'll just turn back around,
get Mr. Lockhart.

06:44.005 --> 06:45.838
Yo, I swear to God,
don't fuck with me.

06:45.921 --> 06:48.255
Yo, I was just joking! Chill! Chill!

06:48.338 --> 06:49.796
Get your stupid-ass friend.

06:50.380 --> 06:52.505

07:48.880 --> 07:51.588
And Bastian,
let me know about Puerto Rico.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.630
- We need you down there.
- You bet, man.

07:55.505 --> 07:57.005
So tired of him.

07:58.338 --> 08:00.671
I mean, Eduardo's a good guy.
I think he likes you.

08:00.755 --> 08:03.546
You think? If he makes another pass at me,
I'm finna throw up.

08:06.463 --> 08:08.397
- I cannot wait to get to the crib.
- Hey, Carlito.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.796
This shit is heavy.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.630
- Carlito, what is up?
- You want me to carry it some?

08:12.713 --> 08:14.713
Oh!

08:14.796 --> 08:16.505
Now that we're almost home,
you wanna help?

08:16.588 --> 08:18.046
You would like to help?
No, I'm good.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.046
<i>- </i> Oh, boy.
- I'm fine.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.546
All right. I'll get the slushies.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.338
- What flavor do you want?
- Red.

08:22.713 --> 08:24.671
- That's a color.
- It's still a flavor!

08:24.755 --> 08:27.755
I don't see a red label,
so your ass is getting blue raspberry.

08:28.296 --> 08:29.713
Pshh. Red.

08:30.796 --> 08:32.596
Didn't I tell you not to come in here?

08:32.630 --> 08:34.356
- It's gonna cost you.
- Hey, asshole!

08:34.380 --> 08:36.630
- What's in the bag?
- Nothing's in the bag.

08:36.712 --> 08:39.212
- What's in the bag, yo?
- Yo, dickhead, step off!

08:45.546 --> 08:47.226
Of course you'd be hanging with this herb.

08:48.505 --> 08:51.338
Fuck you, Jared!
I do not know what I saw in you.

08:52.213 --> 08:54.546
She ain't even on your level.

09:02.796 --> 09:03.796
Inappropriate.

09:05.838 --> 09:08.338
What? You used to be all about this dick.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.296
I'm too tired of you lying on me!

09:11.380 --> 09:13.213
- Get off me!
- You asshole!

09:13.296 --> 09:14.880
CJ, stop!

09:14.963 --> 09:16.963
Boy, you telling people
I'm not a virgin, huh?

09:17.046 --> 09:18.713
- CJ, stop!
- You asshole!

09:18.796 --> 09:20.596
- Someone's gonna call the cops!
- Get off me!

09:20.630 --> 09:23.391
- Just 'cause you a girl, don't mean...
- Don't mean what, lil' nigga?

09:23.505 --> 09:25.671
What it don't mean?
What you was about to say?

09:30.546 --> 09:32.380
Bro, why you not talking?
What it don't mean?

09:32.713 --> 09:35.046
- Hey, baby! Let's go.
- Get the fuck outta here.

09:35.130 --> 09:36.296
You're a bitch ass!

09:36.380 --> 09:38.505
Yeah, I'll smack the shit out you, nigga.

09:42.296 --> 09:43.296
Claudette.

09:45.796 --> 09:46.796
Claudette!

09:47.588 --> 09:49.856
I come out of work,
I see some dude 'bout to swing on you.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.720
Then what?
My black ass would've been arrested.

09:51.755 --> 09:53.475
I don't need
you always playin' big brother.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.505
Aight. I'm the only big brother you got.

09:55.796 --> 09:56.838
You, too, Bash.

09:56.921 --> 09:58.981
- Should've thrown a slushy in his face.
- Know what?

09:59.005 --> 10:00.713
I'm done arguing with you, yo.

10:00.796 --> 10:02.036
You figure out what to tell Mom

10:02.088 --> 10:04.008
when she see you out here
acting like a hood rat.

10:04.046 --> 10:06.088
All right. Relax. I'm not no hood rat.

10:06.171 --> 10:07.588
That's what you look like to me.

10:07.671 --> 10:10.588
Every time somebody says something to you,
you're just ready to go off.

10:10.671 --> 10:11.505
No, I'm not.

10:11.588 --> 10:13.481
- Well, you do...
- All right, shut up, Sebastian.

10:13.505 --> 10:15.105
Yo, you're the fucking hood rat, Calvin.

10:15.171 --> 10:17.296
You're the one Mama has to worry about,
not me.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.005
- You know what?
- Guys.

10:19.088 --> 10:21.713
You got a control problem, CJ.
You need to deal with that shit.

10:21.796 --> 10:23.505
You need to deal
with your control problem.

10:23.588 --> 10:25.772
- Always trying to control me.
- We're not the same age.

10:25.796 --> 10:27.671
Oh, my God!
You are three years older than me.

10:27.755 --> 10:29.671
Hello! Hey!

10:31.630 --> 10:34.630
- We're good? You're a little loud here.
- Yeah. Everything's fine, officer.

10:34.671 --> 10:37.046
Yo! Fair warning, I'm recording!
I'll send this shit viral!

10:38.463 --> 10:40.505
All right. Uh, nothing's wrong, officers.

10:40.588 --> 10:42.828
<i>- </i> I was just talking to my brother.
<i>- </i> I'm not asking you.

10:43.296 --> 10:44.380
I'm asking him.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.796
Are you deaf? We good.
Like my kid sister just said...

10:48.880 --> 10:49.921
Let's see some IDs!

10:50.505 --> 10:52.296
- You can't just come over here...
- Now!

10:52.380 --> 10:54.546
- ...asking for fucking IDs.
- Starting with you!

10:54.630 --> 10:57.588
Did you ask Francis Pierre
for his ID before you shot him?

11:01.380 --> 11:03.338
That's right. Still rolling.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.338
<i>Babylon!</i> Move away from them, <i>Babylon!
Ya bun a fyah!</i>

11:10.421 --> 11:13.380
Y'all picked the wrong day!
Get away from them, <i>Babylon!</i>

11:13.463 --> 11:15.063
We gotta go.
We got something on East 38.

11:15.088 --> 11:16.713
I deal with no police brutality.

11:16.796 --> 11:19.630
Yo, punching in the face,
andkicking them on the ground and <i>ting.</i>

11:19.713 --> 11:21.630
<i>- Ya bun a fyah!</i>
- All right. Get out of here.

11:22.213 --> 11:25.296
Ya's a fool, you know!

11:42.088 --> 11:43.088
You okay?

11:46.671 --> 11:47.671
I'm fine.

11:50.255 --> 11:52.505
- You have a cut right there.
- I said I'm fine!

11:59.588 --> 12:00.755
I am so sorry.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.213
Stupid-ass Jared, lying on me?

12:04.005 --> 12:05.838
Saying that he was my first?

12:06.380 --> 12:08.088
No, I would never. Not with him.

12:08.171 --> 12:10.505
You know, he got the jump on me.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.088
'Cause had I seen him, I would've been...

12:16.380 --> 12:18.546
Mm! Ooh, no doubt!

12:18.630 --> 12:20.963
- I had to keep clean or whatever.
- For real.

12:22.046 --> 12:25.755
No, but seriously, thanks for what you did
back there at the store. You have my back.

12:27.588 --> 12:28.588
Always.

12:29.713 --> 12:32.088
Now, unpack this shit.
We got a lot to do before the expo.

12:32.171 --> 12:34.046
You're right. Mm. Okay.

12:34.296 --> 12:35.838
It's gonna be a long-ass week.

12:37.338 --> 12:40.046
Hey, boy. Hey, CJ. What's the business?

12:40.505 --> 12:42.380
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Hey, Mr. Thomas.

12:42.463 --> 12:46.005
Glad you got home.
Need help with the lawn today.

12:46.088 --> 12:48.421
Yeah. We just got back here, um.

12:48.505 --> 12:50.305
We have a lot of work to do.
Expo's next week.

12:50.338 --> 12:53.213
- So we're on a really tight deadline.
- Hello, hello.

12:53.296 --> 12:56.880
You guys just can't be hanging around
the garage like this all the time.

12:56.963 --> 12:58.643
It's not healthy for your brain, you know.

12:58.671 --> 13:01.231
Yeah, we know.
We've been working on this for a year.

13:01.255 --> 13:03.522
- We'll just give it a bit more time...
- Listen...

13:03.546 --> 13:05.586
It'll get us into college.
There'll be scholarships!

13:05.630 --> 13:07.296
- Scholarships? Really?
- Yes.

13:07.380 --> 13:09.171
Now, I like that. I do!

13:09.505 --> 13:13.463
Or is it that you two just like
being together alone too much, eh?

13:17.296 --> 13:18.380
Listen, Sebastian.

13:18.963 --> 13:20.755
- Expo's next week, right?
- Yeah.

13:20.838 --> 13:24.421
Yes, you have enough time to finish
whatever it is that you're doing.

13:24.505 --> 13:28.963
After that, you're going to get yourself
a proper summer job, right?

13:29.338 --> 13:32.046
Can't have you
in this garage all summer, boy.

13:32.296 --> 13:35.713
Make sense? One week, story done.

13:36.921 --> 13:39.671
What is that? What is that you do, boy?
You suck your teeth?

13:39.755 --> 13:40.921
- Nothing.
- Eh?

13:41.005 --> 13:42.963
Unless you want to get
a hole in your teeth, eh?

13:52.713 --> 13:56.130
Listen, when we get this up and running,
we gon' be out of here.

13:56.713 --> 13:59.296
MIT, Stanford, Morehouse, Spelman,

13:59.380 --> 14:01.963
all begging for us
to come to their schools.

14:02.755 --> 14:04.380
- Right? Okay.
- Right.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.171
Just gotta put in this work.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.338
Hmm.

14:23.088 --> 14:25.255
That's what it is. It's the tubing.

14:26.463 --> 14:29.421
Yeah, I mean, it looks like the force
of the protons were just too much.

14:29.505 --> 14:32.380
Yeah. Told you
those extra supplies would come in handy.

14:37.338 --> 14:38.338
All right.

14:48.713 --> 14:49.713
Can I help you?

14:50.505 --> 14:51.963
We heard y'all got the juice.

14:53.255 --> 14:54.630
What kind of juice?

14:55.213 --> 14:56.893
- Orange juice?
- With or without the pulp?

14:56.921 --> 14:58.880
- With the pulp.
- Who sent you?

14:58.963 --> 15:01.130
- Your boy Eduardo sent me.
- And Kimberly sent me.

15:03.296 --> 15:04.421
Aight. Bet.

15:06.213 --> 15:07.671
Damn!

15:07.755 --> 15:10.755
We got your screen protectors,
your lemon drops, your jolly chargers,

15:10.838 --> 15:12.963
your sweet tooth headsets,
your hover-selfies...

15:13.046 --> 15:15.213
I just came to get a new battery
for my phone, ma!

15:15.755 --> 15:18.755
Yeah, and I'm just here
to pick up my auntie's laptop.

15:19.505 --> 15:22.171
- Then why didn't y'all just say that?
- Y'all gotta speak up.

15:25.088 --> 15:27.208
All right.
Tell her we completely refurbished it.

15:27.255 --> 15:29.755
The RAM's been boosted
to a 16 gigabyte DDR3,

15:29.838 --> 15:33.713
and we took out the optical drive,
and we replaced it with these new SSDs...

15:34.255 --> 15:36.588
Uh, tell her it works like a 2015.

15:36.671 --> 15:38.463
- Three times as fast.
- Word.

15:38.546 --> 15:39.880
Uh...

15:44.171 --> 15:45.380
We rocks with Kim.

15:46.296 --> 15:47.213
Family discount.

15:47.296 --> 15:48.296
For real?

15:49.005 --> 15:50.255
Hey!

15:53.296 --> 15:54.755
I'm family, too, right?

15:56.296 --> 15:58.296
<i>On the heels
of three nights of protests</i>

15:58.338 --> 15:59.338
<i>mostly peaceful,</i>

15:59.421 --> 16:04.505
<i>the community is still outraged over
the slaying of 17-year-old Francis Pierre.</i>

16:04.588 --> 16:07.296
<i>Residents continue
to gather here on Church Avenue</i>

16:07.380 --> 16:11.046
<i>demanding change and justice
for Francis Pierre and his family.</i>

16:11.130 --> 16:12.713
<i>Whose street? Our street!</i>

16:12.796 --> 16:14.380
<i>Whose street? Our street!</i>

16:14.463 --> 16:16.421
<i>Protesters say
that those regularly targeted</i>

16:16.505 --> 16:18.296
<i>by police harassment and violence</i>

16:18.380 --> 16:21.505
<i>are overwhelmingly
the city's poor and minority communities.</i>

16:21.755 --> 16:24.671
<i>- They pledge...</i>
- Hmm. It's a shame how they shot that boy.

16:26.255 --> 16:28.630
This shit is sad.
They really don't care about us.

16:28.713 --> 16:29.713
Watch your mouth.

16:30.713 --> 16:32.005
I knew him, too.

16:32.671 --> 16:33.671
Good kid.

16:35.463 --> 16:38.255
Claudette Josephine,
cutting it kinda close, ain't you?

16:38.588 --> 16:39.713
You missed dinner,

16:39.796 --> 16:42.546
but the pile of dishes are waiting on you.
It's still your night.

16:48.255 --> 16:50.505
Oh, no. Not you, Mom. No, not you.
I just gotta...

16:50.588 --> 16:52.255
I gotta put my stuff down.

16:54.838 --> 16:56.880
- Hey, Kimberly.
- Hey, CJ.

16:56.963 --> 16:59.088
Thanks for the upgrade
on my laptop, sweetie.

16:59.171 --> 17:00.171
No problem.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.546
Let me help my little sis with this.

17:22.296 --> 17:23.296
Pshh!

17:23.963 --> 17:26.630
All right. Damn.
I know you mad about earlier, aight?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.796
But... I was just looking out for you.

17:29.380 --> 17:32.463
Aight? I'm not trying to, like,
say you can't handle yourself

17:32.546 --> 17:35.338
or come off all misogyny and shit either.

17:35.421 --> 17:39.005
"Misogyny" is a noun defined
as the hatredof,

17:39.088 --> 17:42.171
or contempt for,
or prejudice against women,

17:42.255 --> 17:44.338
while "misogynistic"
is the correct adjective

17:44.421 --> 17:46.463
you're looking for to describe <i>you</i>

17:46.755 --> 17:49.046
as someone who professes misogyny.

17:50.213 --> 17:51.463
Misogynistic.

17:53.588 --> 17:55.713
I'm mad you really explained that though.

17:56.338 --> 17:59.005
Like you just went mad hog for no reason.

17:59.088 --> 18:01.838
I'm a little tired of people telling me
how I should act.

18:02.421 --> 18:05.296
CJ, maybe if you listened more,
you would act right.

18:07.171 --> 18:08.338
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.630
Calm down, aight?
What I'm... All I'm trying to say is,

18:11.713 --> 18:14.421
you gotta learn to control
that temper of yours, CJ.

18:14.505 --> 18:16.380
Well, I wonder where I get it from.

18:22.130 --> 18:23.421
Yo...

18:23.546 --> 18:25.713
Yo, I'm just trying to look out for you

18:25.796 --> 18:28.046
and make sure you ain't messing
nothing up for yourself.

18:28.130 --> 18:29.130
Aight?

18:29.463 --> 18:31.130
Damn, what was dude saying anyway?

18:31.713 --> 18:33.046
He was just talking shit.

18:33.671 --> 18:36.130
Look, man, I told you,
these dudes around here...

18:37.463 --> 18:39.338
they can't do nothing for you. Aight?

18:39.421 --> 18:41.880
You going places, CJ,
and since Pops is gone,

18:42.046 --> 18:43.630
I gotta make sure that you get there.

18:45.546 --> 18:47.005
You could go somewhere, too.

18:47.546 --> 18:48.796
We could go together.

18:49.630 --> 18:53.755
Get back focus. Take your SATs,
start applying to colleges.

18:54.588 --> 18:56.546
You know, we could do big things!

18:57.005 --> 18:58.588
Two Walkers, about to...

18:58.671 --> 18:59.963
...explode!

19:03.005 --> 19:04.005
Boom!

19:07.338 --> 19:09.421
Aight. It do sound better
than washing dishes

19:09.505 --> 19:11.713
at the Texas BBQ, all right.
I ain't gonna hold you.

19:11.796 --> 19:13.213
- Yeah.
- Word.

19:16.796 --> 19:18.630
Damn, I hate it when you smart, man.

19:18.755 --> 19:20.713
It's scary, but you inspire me.

19:24.255 --> 19:29.046
So, are you gonna let me hold
dad's dog tags, or...

19:29.296 --> 19:32.421
Dog tags? I ain't even remember I had
these on. You're talking about these?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.255
- Yes.
- Oh, no. Yeah.

19:34.338 --> 19:35.838
You only get these over my dead body.

19:35.921 --> 19:38.838
- Oh, come on!
- What happened to the medal he gave you?

19:39.505 --> 19:43.046
It's upstairs, but I can't wear
that every day. It might fall off.

19:44.713 --> 19:46.088
I just miss him, yo.

19:49.046 --> 19:51.296
Yeah. I miss him, too, you know.

19:55.755 --> 19:57.005
Thinking about Dad?

19:59.088 --> 20:00.088
Uh...

20:00.796 --> 20:02.671
You okay? Hmm?

20:03.755 --> 20:06.463
I haven't checked in in a while.

20:07.838 --> 20:09.630
I'm, uh, fine. I'm okay.

20:13.505 --> 20:14.546
I know, babe.

20:18.380 --> 20:19.380
Come here.

20:24.588 --> 20:26.338
You're just like him, you know that?

20:28.588 --> 20:30.005
You and you brother, but...

20:30.088 --> 20:35.088
Boy, I never met anybody as stubborn
as your daddy till I met you.

20:40.380 --> 20:43.213
- Get some rest. Love you.
- Love you, too.

20:43.588 --> 20:45.463
Uh, are you going to sleep?

20:45.963 --> 20:48.963
I'm probably gonna stay up
for a little while. Catch up on my show.

20:49.630 --> 20:50.921
Waiting up on Calvin?

20:53.671 --> 20:55.463
Who told you to be so smart, huh?

20:56.213 --> 20:58.255
Hmm?

21:01.463 --> 21:05.421
<i>All right. This is
temporal relocation test number 104.</i>

21:05.505 --> 21:07.755
<i>The date is June 29th, 2019,</i>

21:07.838 --> 21:10.755
<i>and this is our fourth test on
our Temporal Relocation Pack Mark Ones.</i>

21:11.338 --> 21:15.005
If this works, we will time-travel
back one day into the past.

21:15.088 --> 21:18.130
During our jump back, we have agreed
not to make any major changes

21:18.213 --> 21:19.853
as to not break the time-space continuum,

21:19.921 --> 21:23.546
possibly altering the future
in ways we could never imagine.

21:24.546 --> 21:25.546
Okay.

21:36.421 --> 21:37.421
Ten...

21:38.088 --> 21:41.630
nine... eight... seven...

21:41.713 --> 21:43.130
six...

21:43.213 --> 21:44.755
five... four...

21:45.796 --> 21:47.921
three... two...

21:55.296 --> 21:56.463
What the f...

21:59.921 --> 22:01.880
- Sebastian, did you change the voltage?
- No!

23:16.630 --> 23:17.630
Okay.

23:19.755 --> 23:21.380
Okay. Wait.

23:25.671 --> 23:29.213
Okay. Check the time coordinates.
Oh, God.

23:37.713 --> 23:38.921
Come on.

23:39.921 --> 23:41.005
Woo-hoo!

23:43.671 --> 23:45.046
- Woo!
- We time traveled.

23:45.130 --> 23:47.588
Look at this beautiful street
that I saw yesterday.

23:47.671 --> 23:49.713
- Look, that wasn't there. Oh, Kim! Kim!
- Kim!

23:49.796 --> 23:52.046
- Do you know what today's date is?
- What?

23:52.505 --> 23:54.380
Do you know the date of today?

23:54.505 --> 23:57.713
Look, I'm sending my niece Zora
to get my laptop later today.

23:58.296 --> 23:59.713
You both look crazy.

24:00.213 --> 24:02.380
Aren't you too old
to be playing with toys?

24:02.713 --> 24:03.713
What's today's date?

24:03.880 --> 24:05.088
June 28th.

24:07.546 --> 24:09.130
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo!

24:09.213 --> 24:12.963
Okay. Somebody else, somebody else.
Um, somebody else has to know the date.

24:13.046 --> 24:16.713
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Excuse me.
Miss, do you know what today's date is?

24:16.796 --> 24:18.088
Yeah, payday!

24:18.171 --> 24:21.088
Wrong! It's June 28th!

24:22.088 --> 24:23.713
That's right. Oh, oh! Excuse me, sir.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.916
- Do you know what the date is?
- Fuck out of my face!

24:25.963 --> 24:27.338
- Wow. All right.
- You're right.

24:27.421 --> 24:29.213
- You have a good day, sir.
- We'll move on.

24:32.546 --> 24:35.255
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Are you sure this idea is necessary?

24:35.338 --> 24:39.088
- I mean, we agreed that...
- We agreed no major changes.

24:39.921 --> 24:43.171
- This is minor. I mean, itsy-bitsy.
- I guess.

24:45.838 --> 24:47.046
Ay, Jared!

24:48.505 --> 24:49.421
Oh, hell no!

24:49.505 --> 24:52.231
Yo, CJ, I can't wait
to get back to the crib. This shit...

24:52.255 --> 24:54.838
- You're soaking wet.
- What the hell happened to y'all?

24:55.463 --> 24:56.796
What... What are you doing?

24:56.880 --> 25:00.296
This is why I didn't wanna do this.
We cannot be seen by our past selves.

25:00.505 --> 25:02.046
Yo, what is good with you?

25:02.130 --> 25:03.890
Why you're always acting
like a wiling bitch?

25:03.921 --> 25:05.921
- What you call me? Asshole!
- What the...

25:06.005 --> 25:07.921
- What you call me?
- CJ, stop!

25:08.005 --> 25:10.505
CJ! CJ, stop!

25:10.588 --> 25:12.630
- CJ, stop!
- You asshole!

25:12.713 --> 25:14.171
Get off of me.

25:15.463 --> 25:17.213
Fuck you, Jared. CJ, stop!

25:17.296 --> 25:19.147
- Just 'cause you're a girl, don't mean...
- What?

25:19.171 --> 25:21.411
- That's my brother! What now, punk?
- CJ, are you crazy?

25:21.463 --> 25:23.713
We cannot be seen
by ourselves in this timeline.

25:24.463 --> 25:27.255
Time-space continuum, CJ.
Time-space continuum.

25:27.338 --> 25:28.255
Okay.

25:29.713 --> 25:31.130
What you about to say?

25:34.505 --> 25:36.880
I got an idea. Come on.

25:37.921 --> 25:39.963
What it don't mean?
What you was about to say?

25:40.046 --> 25:41.963
Got you, mans.

25:42.963 --> 25:45.505
- You swear you tough.
- Yeah, got your stepfather, nigga.

25:45.588 --> 25:46.939
- Got your stepfather.
- Bitch-ass.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.338
- Your mother.
- Nah, your mother!

25:49.421 --> 25:51.713
Your mother! You soft!
You know where I'm at.

25:51.796 --> 25:53.231
Al B. Soft.

25:53.255 --> 25:56.171
- What the... Crazy bitch!
- CJ!

25:57.380 --> 25:58.505
Come here!

25:59.671 --> 26:00.671
Yeah, I'm on you now!

26:00.755 --> 26:02.130
CJ!

26:02.213 --> 26:03.255
Yo. Whoa!

26:03.338 --> 26:05.397
- Jared, yo, get off of me.
- Watch out! Car! The car!

26:05.421 --> 26:06.713
Oh, my God!

26:14.630 --> 26:15.755
Is he...

26:15.838 --> 26:18.296
- You all right?
- Ah, shit.

26:18.380 --> 26:20.463
- What happened?
- Oh, fuck. Thank God.

26:20.796 --> 26:23.130
Oh. CJ, what... Wait!

26:23.213 --> 26:24.630
The wormhole's about to close.

26:24.713 --> 26:27.338
But it's only been 10 minutes.
We can't jump here.

26:27.838 --> 26:30.213
Let's go! Go!
There's too many people.

26:30.296 --> 26:32.880
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Put your fucking phone away!

26:43.380 --> 26:44.671
Sebastian!

26:49.088 --> 26:51.338
You're lucky your grandfather ain't home!

26:51.713 --> 26:54.171
Sorry, Grandma. We were, um...
We were doing an experiment.

26:54.255 --> 26:56.921
What kind of experiment is this?
To mash up me house?

26:57.255 --> 26:59.046
This place is a mess, boy!

26:59.171 --> 27:00.755
We're gonna fix it right now.

27:00.838 --> 27:03.880
Sebastian, if I hear one more explosion,

27:03.963 --> 27:06.463
that'll be the last time you do
your experiments and <i>ting</i>

27:06.546 --> 27:07.963
in me house. You understand?

27:08.255 --> 27:09.255
Yes, Grandma.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.130
And how are you, young lady?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.546
I'm fine, thanks.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.671
Good. Now help Sebastian
clean up this place!

27:21.338 --> 27:22.796
They gon' make me old.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.921
I used to be young.
They gon' make me so old.

27:26.130 --> 27:27.130
Yeah.

27:27.588 --> 27:29.046
Uh-huh. Okay.

27:29.463 --> 27:30.463
Thank you.

27:32.213 --> 27:35.130
He's at Kings County Hospital.
He just broke his arm. He'll be fine.

27:40.005 --> 27:41.805
You got something to say,
my guy, then say it.

27:41.838 --> 27:44.880
We didn't invent time travel
for you to get back at your ex-boyfriend.

27:45.421 --> 27:47.838
I know that you're mad
that Jared got hit by a car,

27:47.921 --> 27:49.481
but I didn't intend for that to happen.

27:49.505 --> 27:50.630
It's not about intentions.

27:50.713 --> 27:52.505
What if he had been killed?
Then what, huh?

27:52.963 --> 27:55.338
It's about controlling something
we have no control over.

27:55.421 --> 27:58.380
Everything great has the capacity
to be good and bad.

27:58.463 --> 28:00.606
- Think of Arthur Galston.
- Science is bigger than us.

28:00.630 --> 28:02.550
Dude thought he was inventing
a soybean enhancer.

28:02.630 --> 28:04.270
Someone else turned it into Agent Orange.

28:04.296 --> 28:06.296
Why are you so serious?
Lighten up for once.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.255
We invented temporal relocation, CJ.

28:08.838 --> 28:10.421
Temporal relocation.

28:10.505 --> 28:12.838
Something Einstein spent his entire life
trying to do.

28:12.921 --> 28:14.130
Yes, and when we win the expo,

28:14.213 --> 28:16.505
we'll be on the cover of <i> NASA Tech Briefs</i>
because of it,

28:16.588 --> 28:17.755

you don't know how to play no dominoes!

28:57.463 --> 28:59.943
What are you talking about?
I just put my last piece down, son.

29:00.796 --> 29:02.463
It don't match, boy.

29:03.005 --> 29:04.925
Boy, you don't know
how to play no damn dominoes.

29:05.005 --> 29:07.921
Boy, move away from here!
You gotta learn before you play.

29:08.463 --> 29:11.713
Y'all playing the old-head version
of dominoes, you feel me?

29:12.130 --> 29:14.338
In the new generation,

29:14.421 --> 29:17.255
Bro, we gotta go, man.
This lame-ass nigga Jared here, man.

29:17.338 --> 29:18.338
- It's a trap.
- Who?

29:19.255 --> 29:20.838
- Yo.
- This nigga.

29:20.921 --> 29:23.796
- Yo, don't do that shit here, dude.
- Watch out. Watch out.

29:28.088 --> 29:30.255
- What you doing here?
- What you coming up to me for?

29:30.338 --> 29:32.963
- Chill, bro.
- What you doing here, bro?

29:33.046 --> 29:35.886
I'll lay your ass out right here.
I wish you would do something.

29:35.963 --> 29:37.483
You play with my sister, bro.

29:37.546 --> 29:40.505
Bullshit, nigga. You acting like
you 'bout to do something, nigga.

29:40.588 --> 29:43.963
- You acting like you tough.
- Hey, hey, hey!

29:44.046 --> 29:46.189
- Not today, boy!
- Don't let me see you on the streets.

29:46.213 --> 29:48.130
- Watch your damn mouth!
- Aight, aight.

29:48.213 --> 29:50.380
- Aight, bro.
- <i>Bumbaclot!</i>

29:52.838 --> 29:54.939
I thought you said
you hit that shit already.

29:54.963 --> 29:57.689
- Yeah, I did tap her.
- Lying ass! Look at your face!

29:57.713 --> 30:00.296
You ain't hit shit. You know
she's gonna be there tonight, right?

30:00.380 --> 30:02.005
Sure you don't wanna change that story?

30:02.088 --> 30:04.880
Aight. Damn, nigga, I ain't hit it yet.
Imma hit it tonight though.

30:04.963 --> 30:06.439
- Goddamn.
- You ain't gonna hit shit.

30:06.463 --> 30:09.421
Yo, give me this. Let me show you
how to properly slide into them DMs.

30:09.505 --> 30:11.865
What'd I tell you about grabbing
a grown man's phone, nigga?

30:11.921 --> 30:13.841
Get the fuck out of here
with that bullshit, man.

30:13.921 --> 30:16.755
Before I smack that jean jacket
bucket hat off your fucking head.

30:16.838 --> 30:18.272
Always talking shit. Get the fuck...

30:18.296 --> 30:19.296
Out of the way!

30:20.046 --> 30:21.963
Where the fuck them niggas going, man?

30:22.671 --> 30:25.022
- They slapped the shit out of my arm.
- You know them niggas?

30:25.046 --> 30:27.546
Fucking Keith, man.
Nigga's always on some bullshit.

30:27.630 --> 30:29.213
Hold on. What the fuck is this?

30:31.421 --> 30:33.213
NYPD, don't fucking move!

30:34.046 --> 30:35.380
Where you two coming from?

30:48.130 --> 30:50.796
<i>An unfortunate start
to the 4th of July holiday.</i>

30:50.880 --> 30:54.546
<i>On Thursday evening,
Calvin Walker, a 19-year-old black teen,</i>

30:54.630 --> 30:57.796
<i>was allegedly shot and killed
by an NYPD officer.</i>

30:57.880 --> 31:00.630
<i>According to police,
Walker was attempting to pull something</i>

31:00.713 --> 31:03.005
<i>out of his pocket when he was shot.</i>

31:03.088 --> 31:05.671
<i>A woman who claimed to have
a bird's eye view of the incident</i>

31:05.755 --> 31:07.796
<i>said that Walker was unarmed.</i>

31:39.713 --> 31:42.630
<i>Now, all of this comes on the heels
of the Francis Pierre shooting,</i>

31:42.713 --> 31:46.755
<i>and activists say this is yet another
example of overzealous policing</i>

31:47.213 --> 31:48.755
<i>and mistaken identity.</i>

31:57.630 --> 32:01.713
Walker and his friend, Dennis Owens,
most likely mistaken for these two men,

32:01.796 --> 32:04.963
who had just robbed
a bodega a few blocks away.

32:06.171 --> 32:08.713
<i>On Friday afternoon,
after a vigil for Walker,</i>

32:08.796 --> 32:10.130
<i>violent protests erupted</i>

32:10.213 --> 32:12.380
<i>in the Crown Heights neighborhood
of Brooklyn.</i>

32:12.463 --> 32:15.713
<i>Those arrested were charged
with failing to obey the law</i>

32:15.796 --> 32:18.171
<i>and illegally walking on a major roadway.</i>

32:18.255 --> 32:21.338
<i>Those who did block traffic
on Nostrand Avenue were chanting,</i>

32:21.421 --> 32:23.463
<i>"Black Lives Matter."</i>

32:23.546 --> 32:25.546
<i>People power! People power!</i>

32:25.630 --> 32:28.296
<i>People power! People power!</i>

32:28.380 --> 32:30.130
<i>People power! People power!</i>

32:30.213 --> 32:34.921
<i>People power! People power!</i>

32:35.130 --> 32:37.963
<i>People power! People power!</i>

32:38.046 --> 32:41.046
Come on, baby, you should not be watching
the news like that.

32:42.046 --> 32:43.713
It will only upset you.

32:44.463 --> 32:48.130
Come on. Let's get you out of this dress
and get you to bed. Come on.

32:49.630 --> 32:51.671
You still have a brother, my love.

32:51.963 --> 32:53.005
Sebastian.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.713
He's your brother, too, you know?

33:00.880 --> 33:02.255
Oh, baby.

33:02.671 --> 33:04.546
I'm so sorry.

33:04.630 --> 33:06.963
I'm so sorry about all of this.

33:09.630 --> 33:10.880
Your father...

33:11.963 --> 33:13.171
and Calvin...

33:19.755 --> 33:24.046
If I could go back and fix it, I would.
But I can't, CJ.

33:25.130 --> 33:27.130
We still have each other, though.

33:27.921 --> 33:29.713
- I'm sorry, what did you say?
- I said...

33:30.171 --> 33:31.421
we still have each other.

33:32.796 --> 33:33.796
Okay?

33:40.588 --> 33:41.630
Get some rest.

33:54.005 --> 33:55.796
Claudette Josephine Walker...

33:57.380 --> 33:58.421
we are here.

35:33.713 --> 35:36.421
"TRP Mark Two."
You added another canister. Why?

35:37.171 --> 35:40.421
Because in this canister,
we can now change the spin of electrons.

35:40.963 --> 35:41.963
Change the spin?

35:42.796 --> 35:44.156
But then they'll become positrons.

35:44.213 --> 35:47.880
And if we introduce the new positrons
to the protons in the original chamber...

35:47.963 --> 35:51.255
It'll be anti-matter
colliding with matter. Pure energy.

35:52.255 --> 35:53.255
- It's good.
- Yup.

35:53.338 --> 35:55.505
It'll give enough energy

35:55.796 --> 35:57.588
so that it could power the machines

35:57.671 --> 35:59.713
to two times faster
than the speed of light.

36:00.463 --> 36:02.380
- Holy shit, CJ.
- Right?

36:03.005 --> 36:03.921
But... But, CJ...

36:04.005 --> 36:06.085
That could expand
the amount of time that we go back.

36:06.130 --> 36:08.338
From a day to probably a week.

36:08.421 --> 36:10.921
CJ, the expo was
the day after Calvin got shot.

36:11.588 --> 36:12.588
We already missed it.

36:12.630 --> 36:14.171
I don't care about the expo.

36:14.546 --> 36:17.838
We can go back.
We can fix it. We can save Calvin.

36:23.963 --> 36:26.755
No, CJ. No, we can't.

36:27.380 --> 36:30.296
We go back and try something like this,

36:30.380 --> 36:33.005
there could be bigger consequences
than Jared's broken arm.

36:33.088 --> 36:35.272
- I don't care about stupid Jared.
- It's not about him.

36:35.296 --> 36:37.776
It's about the unforeseen outcomes
that we could never predict.

36:37.838 --> 36:40.481
There could be real-life consequences
for doing something like this.

36:40.505 --> 36:42.088
Are you shitting me, Sebastian?

36:42.171 --> 36:44.546
Look around you.
Look at where we are.

36:46.088 --> 36:47.588
Look at my brother.

36:50.046 --> 36:51.338
<i>Look </i> at my brother.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.296
You know what?

37:00.963 --> 37:03.963
What do you care?
He wasn't your brother.

37:04.713 --> 37:07.671
I'll do it myself.
I'll pick up the stuff tomorrow.

38:26.046 --> 38:27.463
Granny made it for us.

38:33.005 --> 38:37.130
My uncle sent me that flag from Guyana
after my parents died.

38:37.505 --> 38:40.005
He always says
friends are like your chosen family.

38:41.671 --> 38:44.088
There's no "I."
There's just "we."

38:48.713 --> 38:50.380
I loved Calvin, too, you know.

38:52.588 --> 38:55.463
I know. I shouldn't have said that.

38:56.588 --> 38:58.546
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.
- No...

38:58.963 --> 39:00.671
It's not okay.

39:02.630 --> 39:03.880
I really am sorry.

39:05.255 --> 39:06.255
I know.

39:07.171 --> 39:08.380
You're my best friend.

39:11.963 --> 39:13.046
So, we cool?

39:14.130 --> 39:15.296
Yeah, we cool.

39:15.380 --> 39:16.796
I love you, Black Man.

39:17.380 --> 39:18.588
I love you, too, Black Woman.

39:27.546 --> 39:29.880
All right, look.
These all say the same thing.

39:29.963 --> 39:32.796
Calvin was shot
four days ago on July fourth.

39:32.880 --> 39:35.213
The police encountered him
and Dennis at 5:40,

39:35.296 --> 39:37.255
and then Calvin's dead by 5:47.

39:37.338 --> 39:40.755
So if we just go back,
get them out of there, he's saved.

39:41.130 --> 39:43.010
We'll only have so many times
to get this right.

39:43.046 --> 39:46.421
I mean, the machines will need
to be re-calibrated after every jump.

39:47.255 --> 39:49.255
- We can only go back once a day.
- I know.

39:49.338 --> 39:51.421
And based on our last jump,
wormhole stability's

39:51.505 --> 39:54.463
only going to last for ten minutes
before it starts to collapse.

39:54.546 --> 39:57.088
That gives us ten minutes to save Calvin.

39:57.171 --> 39:59.380
Everything's gonna need to be
damn near perfect.

40:00.421 --> 40:02.130

I can't understand
these children today, no.

41:44.338 --> 41:47.713
You'd better not light another.
You know these for the cookout later!

41:47.796 --> 41:48.796
We did it.

41:49.380 --> 41:51.500
Okay, set your timer clocks.
Ten minutes and counting.

41:51.546 --> 41:52.546
Yeah, come on.

41:54.588 --> 41:56.588
Did you bring Calvin's funeral program?

41:56.671 --> 41:57.796
Bet!

42:01.046 --> 42:02.046
Ooh. What?

42:05.921 --> 42:07.463
Shit. Let's dip.

42:08.838 --> 42:09.963
Y'all herbs wish.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.880
Listen, we're sorry about your arm,
but we really don't have time for this.

42:13.963 --> 42:17.130
Yeah, I bet your asses are sorry.
And your brother ain't here now, is he?

42:18.213 --> 42:20.613
So look, we're gonna square up on all this
and just figure...

42:22.546 --> 42:23.630
Come on!

42:49.213 --> 42:51.046
- Hey!
- Hey!

42:51.588 --> 42:53.796
- Hey, call me, call me!
- I don't want you!

42:55.505 --> 42:57.755
Hey! What's going on?

43:04.713 --> 43:05.713
Move! Move!

43:07.880 --> 43:11.171
Hey! Tell your friends
not to mash up everything, man.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.671
Go on! Now, man!

43:13.463 --> 43:16.296
- Yo, yo, let me show you something.
- Give me my shit back, man.

43:16.380 --> 43:17.380
Out of the way!

43:17.630 --> 43:19.380
Yo, where the fuck them niggas going?

43:20.796 --> 43:22.716
- You know them niggas?
- Fucking Keith always...

43:22.796 --> 43:24.505
- Just fucking Keith, man.
- You know them?

43:24.588 --> 43:27.356
- Nigga's always wiling, running around...
- Yo, what the fuck is this?

43:29.588 --> 43:31.713
No!

43:31.796 --> 43:33.156
We're too late.

43:33.380 --> 43:35.838
- No, we're here.
- We need to go back to the alleyway!

43:35.921 --> 43:37.681
- We're here! We're right...
- CJ, he's gone!

43:40.046 --> 43:41.046
He's gone.

43:44.713 --> 43:45.713
We need to go.

43:58.005 --> 44:00.421
Fuck! Stupid-ass Jared!

44:00.671 --> 44:04.755
God! We... The whole day wasted!
God, we didn't even make it to Malcolm X!

44:04.838 --> 44:06.713
CJ, calm down. We have another chance.

44:06.796 --> 44:08.463
You calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!

44:08.546 --> 44:09.630
We'll get this right.

44:11.546 --> 44:14.130
- Come on.
- Get off me. I don't need a fucking hug.

44:33.505 --> 44:34.505
That's it.

44:34.755 --> 44:35.921
We stop the robbery.

44:37.005 --> 44:39.314
That's the only way
we can keep them from murdering Calvin.

44:39.338 --> 44:41.796
CJ, those dudes were dangerous.
Probably on some shit.

44:42.171 --> 44:44.130
I don't want guns in either of our faces.

44:44.213 --> 44:46.588
To make sure the changes
that we make are effective,

44:46.963 --> 44:49.421
we have to visit
as close as possible to the murder.

44:52.296 --> 44:54.630
What y'all doing in here? Y'all working?

44:55.796 --> 44:58.213
Yes, Granny. Thanks for the snacks.

44:58.505 --> 44:59.546
Is everything okay?

44:59.630 --> 45:01.588
- Yeah.
- Yes ma'am. We're fine. Thank you.

45:01.671 --> 45:06.088
Listen, you need anything,
I am here. Okay?

45:07.338 --> 45:08.755
You take good care of her.

45:14.546 --> 45:17.130
No one said anything
about having any guns in our faces.

45:17.213 --> 45:18.713
All right. Look...

45:20.796 --> 45:22.213
Carlito's Bodega is here.

45:23.255 --> 45:26.338
According to the news,
the robbery happens at 5:35,

45:26.421 --> 45:29.296
and the 911 call comes in at 5:36.

45:29.713 --> 45:33.630
All we have to do is call the cops
before the robbery happens. No robbery...

45:34.046 --> 45:35.526
- Calvin's alive.
- ...Calvin's alive.

45:37.005 --> 45:40.505
Okay, but we need to do something
about running into our past selves.

45:40.588 --> 45:43.588
We're good. We were
at Bulletproof Comics that day, remember?

45:44.130 --> 45:47.213
No, I mean,
we just did our first attempt, right?

45:47.296 --> 45:48.130
Yeah.

45:48.213 --> 45:51.296
And we're about to do another attempt,
right, during the same time frame?

45:51.380 --> 45:52.380
Okay, so?

45:52.463 --> 45:55.263
Our first-attempt selves still exist
in the ten minutes we jumped from.

45:55.338 --> 45:58.213
And we don't wanna bump into
our first-attempt selves either. Yeah.

45:58.296 --> 45:59.421
No, we do not.

46:01.005 --> 46:03.213
We need something
that can direct a lot of energy.

46:06.546 --> 46:07.921
You're not gonna like this, CJ.

46:08.421 --> 46:10.171
You are not going to like this.

46:16.463 --> 46:18.880
Sweetie, you are just too good to me.

46:19.630 --> 46:22.796
- Better?
- Yes, it hurts less now.

46:23.088 --> 46:25.671
- You sure?
- Yes. I'm good, my love.

46:25.755 --> 46:27.630
Oh, the remote, where is it?

46:30.130 --> 46:31.380
Right here.

46:31.755 --> 46:32.755
Thank you.

46:33.005 --> 46:35.171
Wait, sit down.

46:35.421 --> 46:38.046
That CJ, she's very pretty, no?

46:38.380 --> 46:40.421
Yeah.

46:40.505 --> 46:42.380
Well, I'm really happy for you,

46:42.463 --> 46:46.671
but I want you to be careful, because
she looks like she's a little rough, no?

46:48.046 --> 46:50.755
Grandma, you have no idea.

46:50.838 --> 46:51.755
Mmm.

47:00.296 --> 47:01.630
Damn, bro, what took you so long?

47:01.713 --> 47:04.296
Had to grab some snacks
for y'all ungrateful asses.

47:14.713 --> 47:15.713
So...

47:16.296 --> 47:17.338
what's this about?

47:18.380 --> 47:21.005
Y'all say you need some energy conduits?

47:22.713 --> 47:25.588
Uh, yeah, we need something
that can handle large amounts of energy.

47:26.755 --> 47:28.755
Why don't y'all build
a circuit board or something?

47:29.963 --> 47:31.421
For our specifications,

47:31.880 --> 47:35.255
we need something
with obscene energy capacity.

47:35.671 --> 47:37.380
- Obscene?
- Yeah.

47:38.130 --> 47:39.380
How obscene?

47:41.213 --> 47:44.088
- Like... Uh...
- Like?

47:45.963 --> 47:46.796
Uh...

47:46.880 --> 47:49.880
Like the quantum circuit boards
you built for the end-of-the-year project.

47:50.671 --> 47:54.213
Nah! Nah! I'm sorry.
That ain't happening, B.

47:54.296 --> 47:55.380
- Yo, listen to me.
- Sorry!

47:55.463 --> 47:57.213
I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important.

47:57.296 --> 48:00.216
- This is the only thing that's gonna work.
- Really? And what's this for?

48:04.671 --> 48:05.963
Um...

48:07.255 --> 48:10.713
Some new shit...
that, uh, we can't talk about yet.

48:11.130 --> 48:15.463
So, y'all need my shit
to make your new shit,

48:15.921 --> 48:17.505
but you can't tell me shit?

48:17.588 --> 48:19.296
Well, shit. That's pretty much it.

48:19.880 --> 48:20.963
- Yeah.
- What?

48:21.880 --> 48:24.171
Nah! Nah! Sorry!

48:31.921 --> 48:35.005
Give us the quantum circuit board,
and I'll go on a date with you.

48:35.088 --> 48:38.296
Yes! I've been waiting on you
since the fourth grade.

48:38.588 --> 48:40.546
Imma treat you like a <i>princesa.</i>

48:44.546 --> 48:47.338
Get your ass off my bed, please.
Thank you very much.

48:47.421 --> 48:50.171
And turn that way, please.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

48:57.213 --> 48:58.213
Come on.

49:09.505 --> 49:10.505
Wow.

49:16.130 --> 49:17.130
So cool.

49:19.546 --> 49:21.130
I just wanna touch it.

49:22.671 --> 49:25.546
So, this is like giving
the TRPs a lobotomy?

49:25.796 --> 49:26.880
Precisely.

49:26.963 --> 49:29.683
Theoretically, we won't encounter
our previous time-traveling selves.

49:29.755 --> 49:32.421
I mean, those quantum boards
should be able to route enough energy

49:32.505 --> 49:34.713
from the gamma rays
to splice time entirely,

49:34.796 --> 49:37.463
creating a virtual reset
of our previous time jumps.

49:37.755 --> 49:38.963
Whoa, that's wild.

49:40.213 --> 49:41.213
So, tomorrow?

49:41.963 --> 49:42.963
Tomorrow.

49:43.421 --> 49:44.505
Let's get some rest.

49:46.171 --> 49:47.463
We'll get it right this time.

50:09.921 --> 50:11.171
Hey, ma, did you eat yet?

50:11.463 --> 50:13.588
<i>On this, the third day of protests...</i>

50:13.671 --> 50:16.046
- I'm not hungry.
- <i>...in the killing of Calvin Walker,</i>

50:16.130 --> 50:19.213
<i>violence has once again erupted,
as community and city leaders...</i>

50:19.296 --> 50:20.546
That's not good, ma.

50:20.630 --> 50:22.421
<i>...remain calm and peaceful.</i>

50:22.505 --> 50:26.963
<i>Storefronts and businesses in the area
have scheduled a town hall this week...</i>

50:35.880 --> 50:37.838
...<i>tell me you've eaten that whole pie.</i>

50:37.921 --> 50:39.796
<i> Uh...</i>

50:41.255 --> 50:43.505
<i>No wonder
you haven't been in the gym since '93.</i>

50:43.588 --> 50:46.755
<i>- Look what you're putting in your body.</i>
<i>-  Well, Tasha, Monique said...</i>

50:46.838 --> 50:50.046
<i>This isn't about Monique, Jay.
She's working on herself.</i>

50:50.421 --> 50:52.296
<i>Can you say the same? No!</i>

50:52.630 --> 50:54.963
- <i>Sorry, Tasha.
- No more apologies, Jay.</i>

50:55.255 --> 50:57.630
<i>You need help.
And I'm the one to give it to you.</i>

50:57.713 --> 50:59.755
<i>- Now say the mantra.</i>
<i>- No...</i>

50:59.838 --> 51:01.046
<i>- Come on!</i>
<i>- Say it.</i>

51:01.588 --> 51:03.380
<i>Ugh!</i>

51:46.921 --> 51:50.546
- What the bla...
- What the blazes is going...

51:50.630 --> 51:53.380
Hello? I want to report a robbery.

52:19.963 --> 52:20.963
What time is it?

52:22.796 --> 52:23.796
5:30.

52:24.088 --> 52:26.546
Where are they?
I called them five minutes ago.

52:26.880 --> 52:28.630
They take a minute sometimes.

52:28.713 --> 52:31.463
I called before it even happened.
How much head start do they need?

52:31.546 --> 52:32.546
- I'm just going in.
- CJ.

52:32.630 --> 52:35.189
You're gonna go into a bodega
we already know is gonna get robbed?

52:35.213 --> 52:37.213
Look around. The NYPD ain't coming.

52:37.463 --> 52:39.755
We can't waste this jump
or any more time.

52:39.838 --> 52:42.880
- I... I know, CJ.
- I'm just going in to warn Carlito, okay?

52:42.963 --> 52:45.380
Remember, the robbery doesn't happen
until 5:35.

52:45.463 --> 52:48.522
I've five minutes to warn him and then
get the fuck out. Shouldn't take me two.

52:48.546 --> 52:50.088
- CJ!
- Just wait for me.

52:57.921 --> 52:58.921
CJ!

53:01.796 --> 53:02.796
CJ!

53:03.588 --> 53:05.296
What's wrong with you the other day?

53:05.380 --> 53:07.296
Splashing people with slushies
in my store!

53:07.380 --> 53:08.740
I really gotta tell you something.

53:08.796 --> 53:10.596
I won't tell your mother,
but that's not cool.

53:10.630 --> 53:11.796
You gotta listen to me, okay?

53:11.880 --> 53:13.000
I don't wanna listen to you.

53:13.046 --> 53:15.088
- Carlito, please...
- CJ?

53:16.296 --> 53:17.939
- What the fuck?
- What are you doing here?

53:17.963 --> 53:20.463
I thought we were meeting at Bulletproof.
You said 5:30, right?

53:23.630 --> 53:27.255
Oh, jeez! Okay, um, I... I...
Just give me a minute.

53:31.296 --> 53:33.005
What the fuck are you looking at?

53:34.546 --> 53:36.546
Nothing.

53:39.171 --> 53:41.213
Okay. Okay.

53:41.921 --> 53:43.046
CJ, what are you doing?

53:43.130 --> 53:46.171
Just... Just go, okay?
I'll meet you at the comic store.

53:46.421 --> 53:48.181
You're wearing TRPs.
You doing it without me?

53:48.255 --> 53:49.588
Just go, please, Sebastian.

53:49.671 --> 53:52.588
Jesus! I'll tell you everything later.
Okay? Just go!

54:09.880 --> 54:12.296
Don't move! Stay right there!
I know what you're up to, man.

54:12.380 --> 54:13.880
- I ain't up to...
- Stay right there.

54:13.963 --> 54:16.088
- Put the gun down, bro!
- Stay right there.

54:16.171 --> 54:18.314
- Don't move.
- Put the motherfucking gun down right now!

54:18.338 --> 54:19.630
- All right.
- Yeah.

54:20.380 --> 54:21.463
Now what?

54:21.546 --> 54:23.755
Put that shit down.
Now give us everything!

54:23.838 --> 54:24.838
Give us everything!

54:24.880 --> 54:26.088
Hurry the fuck up.

54:26.380 --> 54:28.255
Y'all should give us y'all shit, too!

54:28.880 --> 54:31.296
- Give us y'all shit, too, now hurry up!
- All right.

54:31.380 --> 54:33.171
Now the shit on your arm
and the bag, too!

54:33.255 --> 54:34.963
- Give me your fucking bag!
- No.

54:35.046 --> 54:37.005
- Give me the bag!
- No! I need this!

54:37.088 --> 54:39.213
Give me the bag and the shit on your arm!

54:39.296 --> 54:42.088
<i>- </i> Stop!
- I need this. Get off me.

54:42.171 --> 54:43.171
No!

54:57.921 --> 54:59.046
Move, move!

54:59.546 --> 55:00.963
No! No!

55:01.046 --> 55:05.463
No! Oh, God! No! No! Sebastian!

55:06.088 --> 55:07.838
- Call 911, Carlito!
- Okay!

55:07.921 --> 55:09.921
Jesus! Sebastian! Sebastian!

55:10.005 --> 55:12.921
Fuck! No! No! Sebastian, please!

55:13.796 --> 55:14.838
Sebastian!

55:18.963 --> 55:20.171
Fuck! Fuck!

55:21.213 --> 55:22.380
Sebastian, I am so sorry.

55:22.463 --> 55:25.505
I didn't know. I'm sorry. Shit...

55:30.963 --> 55:31.963
CJ...

55:38.963 --> 55:41.088
Fuck! Fuck! You gotta wake up.

55:41.171 --> 55:42.971
Come on, Sebastian.
You gotta wake up! Please!

55:43.005 --> 55:46.755
Please, come on. Wake up!
Wake up! Sebastian!

55:52.880 --> 55:55.963
Fuck! Shit! Come on, you gotta wake up!
You gotta wake up! Come on, please.

55:57.338 --> 55:58.338
Please, wake up!

55:58.921 --> 56:04.171
Jesus. Oh, fuck. Okay, I gotta go.
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

56:54.213 --> 56:55.380
I'm weary.

56:55.463 --> 56:59.130
I'm weary, saints,
as I'm sure many of you are,

56:59.213 --> 57:01.713
because here I stand again before you,

57:02.005 --> 57:07.505
first for Francis Pierre,
and now for one of our most beloved,

57:07.588 --> 57:11.046
Sebastian Jefferson Thomas.

57:11.130 --> 57:13.005
A promising young man,

57:13.088 --> 57:14.921
only 16 years old.

57:15.255 --> 57:18.463
This was the summer
before his senior year of high school,

57:18.546 --> 57:22.796
and he, he had dreams, saints. Plans.

57:22.880 --> 57:26.296
Dreams that will now never be realized.

57:26.380 --> 57:30.005
Dreams of going to college
and becoming a scientist.

57:30.088 --> 57:34.088
Instead, we now all sit here
mourning his loss,

57:34.171 --> 57:39.671
a young man in our community full
of endless promise and potential,

57:39.755 --> 57:41.921
whose life been cut short.

57:43.671 --> 57:45.171
And I have to admit

57:46.046 --> 57:49.171
I, like so many of you out there,

57:49.463 --> 57:53.255
have to ask, "Where is the justice?

57:53.963 --> 57:59.380
<i>Where is the justice for our sons,
and our daughters, and our communities?</i>

57:59.463 --> 58:01.880
<i>When will it end, the grieving,</i>

58:02.088 --> 58:06.505
<i>not just for Flatbush,
but for the whole nation,</i>

58:06.588 --> 58:10.130
<i>and all the black
and brown communities within it?</i>"

58:10.213 --> 58:12.630
<i>What does the Lord require of you,</i>

58:12.713 --> 58:16.130
<i>but to walk just, and to be mercy,</i>

58:16.213 --> 58:19.296
<i>and to love and live humbly
by your God?</i>

58:19.380 --> 58:23.046
<i>And the peace,
that which surpasses all understanding,</i>

58:23.130 --> 58:26.796
<i>will guard your heart
and your mind through Christ Jesus.</i>

58:26.880 --> 58:29.463
<i>I remember God's promises.</i>

58:40.046 --> 58:42.755
- Mom?
- In the living room.

58:45.505 --> 58:46.505
What happened?

58:47.921 --> 58:48.921
Gloria...

58:50.421 --> 58:52.796
She at the Kings County Hospital.

58:56.213 --> 58:58.380
They said it's a nervous breakdown.

59:02.296 --> 59:05.880
She can't stomach to see
Sebastian gone, so...

59:05.963 --> 59:06.963
Mm-hmm.

59:08.505 --> 59:11.963
I don't know what's gonna happen.

59:20.505 --> 59:21.505
CJ.

59:23.880 --> 59:24.880
CJ!

59:25.880 --> 59:28.880
- Claudette! I know you hear me talking.
- What? I just wanna be left alone!

59:28.921 --> 59:31.397
- Jesus! Why doesn't anyone...
- Do not play with me right now,

59:31.421 --> 59:33.630
- and I'm dead-ass. We need to talk.
- What? What?

59:37.838 --> 59:39.130
This some sort of joke?

59:41.463 --> 59:44.383
- Calvin, where did you get that?
- You know where the hell I got it from.

59:45.755 --> 59:47.255
Now, explain to me what's going on.

59:47.671 --> 59:50.713
'Cause ain't nothing been right
around here since Sebastian got murdered.

59:51.171 --> 59:52.421
He was a better person than me,

59:52.505 --> 59:54.630
and damn sure was
a better friend than you.

59:55.380 --> 59:58.296
You know... I've been feeling like
this should've been me.

59:59.546 --> 01:00:01.005
And then I find this shit?

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.505
So, you tell me, am I wrong?

01:00:17.713 --> 01:00:19.296
I can't tell if I'm being punked,

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.838
or if I'm still trying to wake up
from a dream right now.

01:00:22.921 --> 01:00:24.213
Time machines?

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:36.255
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to do anything right now, CJ.

01:00:36.338 --> 01:00:38.171
But I know how to fix this now.

01:00:38.421 --> 01:00:40.341
- I... I can handle it.
- You know how to fix it?

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:42.255
Explain to me exactly how.

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:43.588
I don't know. I'm just...

01:00:44.963 --> 01:00:46.796
Imma jump back earlier or something.

01:00:48.171 --> 01:00:50.880
You're gonna... You're just gonna
jump back earlier or something?

01:00:52.213 --> 01:00:53.213
Claudette...

01:00:53.671 --> 01:00:56.338
explain to me exactly
how you're gonna fix this,

01:00:56.421 --> 01:00:59.546
or I swear to God, on Pops'... grave,

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:02.421
I'm destroying all them
little science experiments you got.

01:01:02.505 --> 01:01:04.380
Calvin, I can't explain it right now.

01:01:05.505 --> 01:01:08.463
How about this,
getting shot by police officers?

01:01:09.505 --> 01:01:12.463
Or better yet, getting both
your asses killed by them damn thugs?

01:01:12.546 --> 01:01:15.755
- Yes, but Sebastian didn't deserve this.
- No, he didn't.

01:01:16.838 --> 01:01:17.838
None of us do.

01:01:19.046 --> 01:01:20.880
He didn't, and none of us do.

01:01:28.005 --> 01:01:32.005
I just need some help first,
and then I could devise a plan.

01:01:34.546 --> 01:01:36.713
Okay, then. I'm going with you.

01:01:37.005 --> 01:01:40.796
No, Calvin, have you been listening?
There's only one working time machine.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.463
It has to be me. There's no other way.

01:01:52.255 --> 01:01:54.463
What you need
to get it back up and running, man?

01:01:55.088 --> 01:01:57.546
Not "what." Who.

01:02:00.838 --> 01:02:01.838
Shit!

01:02:04.588 --> 01:02:05.755
CJ?

01:02:07.213 --> 01:02:08.213
CJ!

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.588
Eduardo, who's knocking?

01:02:17.671 --> 01:02:18.921
It's late!

01:02:19.005 --> 01:02:21.338
CJ! Hey! How...

01:02:23.296 --> 01:02:24.838
How you doing? Um...

01:02:25.671 --> 01:02:27.046
Sorry about Sebastian.

01:02:27.796 --> 01:02:29.505
Shit was crazy. It hit me hard, too.

01:02:29.588 --> 01:02:31.505
I know. That's actually why I'm here.

01:02:32.088 --> 01:02:34.046
Yo. You... Whatever you need.

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:36.170
You need someone to talk to
or a shoulder to cry on.

01:02:36.213 --> 01:02:38.171
No, we need your help, okay?

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:40.135
Get dressed
and meet us outside in five minutes.

01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:42.755
Yo, it's mad late!
My <i>abuela </i> ain't gonna let me...

01:02:42.921 --> 01:02:45.130
Wait. "We"?

01:02:49.338 --> 01:02:51.505
Your bro...
You brought your brother to my house?

01:02:51.588 --> 01:02:55.213
Yeah, and we ain't asking, all right?
Five minutes, and bring your tools.

01:03:07.588 --> 01:03:10.796
Temporal relocation? What... Time travel?

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.880
Man, this is...
This is stupid crazy! This is like...

01:03:14.255 --> 01:03:16.046
This shit is...

01:03:40.963 --> 01:03:41.963
Yo, what's going on?

01:03:42.046 --> 01:03:43.046
Shh!

01:03:43.671 --> 01:03:46.463
Y'all gotta stop telling me
to be quiet, man.

01:03:49.796 --> 01:03:52.296
<i>My TRP took a beating
from the last two jumps.</i>

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.380
<i>I can upgrade it, but I think
it might fry the circuit board.</i>

01:03:55.463 --> 01:03:56.463
<i>Can you fix it?</i>

01:03:56.505 --> 01:03:59.713
<i>Of course, I got you.
Let me work my magic.</i>

01:04:14.005 --> 01:04:18.255
My quantum circuit boards,
the genius creation that it is,

01:04:18.338 --> 01:04:20.921
that y'all tried to repurpose
without my full authorization,

01:04:21.546 --> 01:04:24.713
will create
an individual time splice for CJ.

01:04:26.505 --> 01:04:28.963
<i>All she has to do is attune the frequency</i>

01:04:29.046 --> 01:04:32.171
<i>to the TRP Three
to the TRP she previously used.</i>

01:04:32.546 --> 01:04:38.130
That time splice will allow her
to reset that moment in time.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.171
This would seamlessly allow her to access

01:04:41.255 --> 01:04:43.880
that moment
without Sebastian ever knowing.

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:48.046
You two then jump back to present day.

01:04:48.713 --> 01:04:50.755
And Sebastian's alive!

01:04:55.796 --> 01:04:56.963
Are you sure about this, bro?

01:04:57.046 --> 01:05:01.338
Hell, yeah! I mean, as much as you can
theoretically guarantee anything

01:05:01.421 --> 01:05:03.046
that has yet to be proven.

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:05.570
But the only way we can know for sure
is if we actually do it.

01:05:14.213 --> 01:05:15.213
Thanks, Eduardo.

01:05:16.005 --> 01:05:17.963
You know, I almost feel bad for you.

01:05:18.463 --> 01:05:21.713
Really?
'Cause I'm still here, boo, <i>princesa,</i>

01:05:21.796 --> 01:05:24.005
<i>- mamacita,</i> bae...
- Yo, yo. Yo!

01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:26.630
- You gotta go, bro.
- It's okay. I'm cool.

01:05:26.713 --> 01:05:28.380
- Give us some time alone.
- I'm cool.

01:05:28.463 --> 01:05:30.630
You gotta, like,
really calm all that down.

01:05:30.713 --> 01:05:33.838
- You getting a little too comfortable.
- That's cool. I'm cool.

01:05:38.255 --> 01:05:40.213
But I'll never forget this, CJ.

01:05:40.296 --> 01:05:43.505
Yes, you will.
Remember, none of this happened?

01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:45.963
So close...

01:05:49.088 --> 01:05:50.880
You good, though? You set?

01:05:50.963 --> 01:05:54.255
Your rotor-gamma photon-circuit thingy's
connected and all that?

01:05:54.546 --> 01:05:55.963
You got your radio station tuned

01:05:56.046 --> 01:05:58.006
- to the right frequencies and shit, right?
- Yes.

01:05:59.005 --> 01:06:03.463
All right. Look, go back, tell Sebastian
exactly what happened, aight?

01:06:03.546 --> 01:06:05.505
Try to get to us
before we hit Malcolm X Court,

01:06:05.588 --> 01:06:09.005
and then bolt out of there.
Do not stay there. I'm serious.

01:06:09.088 --> 01:06:11.505
Stay far away
from Carlito's bodega and shit,

01:06:11.588 --> 01:06:13.838
- and if you see Jared and...
- Calvin.

01:06:13.921 --> 01:06:15.755
- What?
- I know how to avoid Jared

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:17.255
now that I've ran into him.

01:06:18.213 --> 01:06:19.338
You're just stalling.

01:06:20.505 --> 01:06:21.838
Hand them over.

01:06:23.338 --> 01:06:27.380
- You're just loving this, aren't you?
- Uh... No. Well, yes.

01:06:27.838 --> 01:06:30.755
But if there's any way to convince you
and Dennis, these are it.

01:06:30.838 --> 01:06:32.796
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Every second counts.

01:06:33.546 --> 01:06:34.546
Take it.

01:06:40.546 --> 01:06:44.380
Look, man, make sure you try your hardest
to convince me, all right? But just...

01:06:50.088 --> 01:06:51.838
Just be safe, Claudette.

01:06:58.588 --> 01:07:00.296
I don't want nothing to happen to you.

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:08.630
It's okay.

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:10.338
I'll see you yesterday.

01:07:27.296 --> 01:07:29.755
What the bla...
What the blazes is going...

01:07:32.671 --> 01:07:36.671
Yo! What y'all deal wit? Why you gotta
make so much damn noise and <i> ting?</i>

01:07:37.505 --> 01:07:38.880
Where the hell is she?

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.546
What took you so long?

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:49.380
CJ, what are you... What's going on?

01:07:49.713 --> 01:07:53.171
- No time to explain. Come on. We gotta go.
- What the fuck did you do?

01:07:54.005 --> 01:07:56.380
Domino! Domino on ya tail.

01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:59.505
What is this?
You don't know how to play no dominoes?

01:07:59.588 --> 01:08:01.463
Hey, sonny.

01:08:01.546 --> 01:08:04.255
You all right?
You look like you could use a drink.

01:08:04.338 --> 01:08:08.463
No, I'm good. I'm just... I don't know.
I just feel a little off today, man.

01:08:09.713 --> 01:08:10.713
You need a drink.

01:08:11.005 --> 01:08:14.546
Yo. We gotta go, dawg.
This lame-ass nigga Jared here.

01:08:17.171 --> 01:08:19.171
What's up?
You 'bout to do something, nigga?

01:08:19.255 --> 01:08:20.255
What's up?

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:22.380
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get the fuck out of here.

01:08:23.212 --> 01:08:26.212
You better not light another one.
You know these are for the cookout later.

01:08:26.296 --> 01:08:27.337
Where did you get that?

01:08:27.421 --> 01:08:31.171
CJ, you're headed the wrong way!
We need to go to Carlito's! Come on!

01:08:31.837 --> 01:08:33.630
Watch where you're going!

01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:37.380
And y'all still look crazy.

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:39.755
She could definitely get it, huh?

01:08:41.212 --> 01:08:42.337
Look at her!

01:08:46.046 --> 01:08:49.046
Yo, don't let that Jared dude
get to you, son.

01:08:49.587 --> 01:08:53.755
No. I ain't thinking about him, nigga.
It's just... I don't know.

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:56.505
Something about today is just off, bro.

01:08:56.587 --> 01:08:58.087
- Word.
- Word.

01:08:58.171 --> 01:09:01.421
Calvin! Calvin! Oh, my God! Thank God.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

01:09:01.505 --> 01:09:04.046
- What's wrong with y'all?
- What the fuck is y'all wearing?

01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:05.712
Y'all like some <i>Space Odyssey </i> wannabes.

01:09:05.796 --> 01:09:08.314
- Dennis, shut up! Look.
- We have to get outta here.

01:09:08.337 --> 01:09:09.755
- Shh.
- Come on!

01:09:13.587 --> 01:09:15.212
What is this? Some sort of joke?

01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:18.712
This shit supposed to be funny?
It's a damn funeral program.

01:09:18.796 --> 01:09:20.880
This shit got my face on it,
disappearing and shit.

01:09:20.962 --> 01:09:23.005
I know. I'm sorry,
but you gotta listen to us, okay?

01:09:23.087 --> 01:09:25.005
Can we go? The cops about to come.
Come on!

01:09:25.087 --> 01:09:28.130
- Why would the cops come here?
- You're going to get killed!

01:09:29.546 --> 01:09:30.546
CJ.

01:09:34.755 --> 01:09:38.421
Okay. Okay. Real funny.
Very funny, very creative.

01:09:38.505 --> 01:09:40.962
Now y'all take that stupid shit
y'all got on off!

01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:43.606
- Y'all look ridiculous!
- Look, Carlito's bodega just got robbed.

01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:46.147
- We gotta get out of here.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:09:46.171 --> 01:09:49.130
- Out of the way!
- Where the fuck them niggas going, man?

01:09:49.212 --> 01:09:52.046
Okay, remember these? You gave
these to me. Remember what you said?

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:55.088
"Over my dead body"?
That's how I got these.

01:09:55.171 --> 01:09:57.814
- What the fuck? You got my tags?
- It's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:09:57.838 --> 01:09:59.380
- Something bad is...
- Look, stop!

01:09:59.838 --> 01:10:02.314
All right? I don't know when you snuck off
and had copies made,

01:10:02.338 --> 01:10:04.463
but that shit is bootlegged, aight?

01:10:05.088 --> 01:10:07.338
- Yo, fuck y'all. We out, bro.
- Calvin! Jesus Christ!

01:10:07.421 --> 01:10:09.630
- The fuck is wrong with you, bro? Move!
- Stop!

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.840
- This cannot be fucking happening!
- Yo, what's going on? What's going on?

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.296
CJ. CJ, be calm.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.671
NYPD, where y'all coming from?

01:10:20.755 --> 01:10:22.880
- Don't touch your pockets.
- Keep your mouth shut.

01:10:22.963 --> 01:10:25.064
- Officer, the ones you want...
- Keep your mouth shut!

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:26.421
I'm telling them what's going on!

01:10:26.505 --> 01:10:28.345
- What's going on?
- Stop talking! I'm serious.

01:10:28.421 --> 01:10:31.064
- I need to see some IDs now.
- What's the problem, officer?

01:10:31.088 --> 01:10:32.171
I said IDs, now.

01:10:32.255 --> 01:10:34.380
- What you need to see IDs for?
- IDs, now!

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.088
What, are you tough?

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.546
- Calvin.
- Now!

01:10:41.796 --> 01:10:44.088
Boy, you'd better shit me an ID, quick.

01:10:46.755 --> 01:10:48.995
- You think I'm playing?
- Give it to him, dawg.

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:54.046
- Bullshit, man.
- Yeah, whatever. Stay put.

01:11:21.546 --> 01:11:24.307
- We got the right to know what's going on.
- Everyone be quiet, okay?

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:27.338
If this got anything to do with Carlito's
getting robbed, we didn't do it.

01:11:27.421 --> 01:11:29.314
- I didn't mention that.
- Calvin, no. Stop.

01:11:29.338 --> 01:11:30.938
- On the ground!
- He didn't do anything!

01:11:30.963 --> 01:11:33.546
Get on the ground! On the ground, now!

01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:36.380
- He didn't do anything!
- Get on the ground!

01:11:36.463 --> 01:11:38.921
- On the ground!
- CJ, let's go!

01:11:39.005 --> 01:11:40.671
- Get the fuck down!
- Sebastian!

01:11:40.921 --> 01:11:43.880
CJ! CJ!

01:11:44.421 --> 01:11:46.171
Sebastian!

01:11:46.588 --> 01:11:48.171
CJ!

01:11:50.338 --> 01:11:51.588
Stop resisting!

01:11:52.796 --> 01:11:54.963
- Sebastian!
- Stay the fuck down!

01:14:02.088 --> 01:14:03.171
It's okay.

01:14:04.005 --> 01:14:05.338
I'll see you yesterday.

01:14:43.588 --> 01:14:45.268
Why didn't we stick to the plan

01:14:45.296 --> 01:14:46.838
and stop the robbers at the bodega?

01:14:48.255 --> 01:14:49.255
What?

01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:54.771
How many times have you jumped back, CJ?

01:14:57.421 --> 01:14:59.838
I'm not stupid! I...
You're wearing different clothing.

01:15:04.463 --> 01:15:05.505
Claudette!

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.296
You got no right to hide shit from me.

01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:10.763
- How many times have you jumped back?
- Once.

01:15:10.838 --> 01:15:12.518
- Just once?
- Yes, just once, I'm serious.

01:15:12.796 --> 01:15:13.796
Why?

01:15:14.088 --> 01:15:16.288
We had a surefire plan!
And then you come a minute late,

01:15:16.338 --> 01:15:17.963
and we don't go through with it. Why?

01:15:23.005 --> 01:15:24.671
Why? I'm asking a question!

01:15:25.213 --> 01:15:27.088
Because you died, Sebastian.

01:15:30.171 --> 01:15:31.171
You died...

01:15:32.296 --> 01:15:34.213
'cause the surefire plan fell through.

01:15:54.046 --> 01:15:57.838
But remember, now that I went back,
it's like none of it happened.

01:15:57.921 --> 01:16:01.088
No, no, no, CJ.
You just told me that I get murdered!

01:16:01.588 --> 01:16:03.421
I know.
It's because we didn't do it right.

01:16:03.505 --> 01:16:06.796
No, CJ, that's it. We're not...
We can't do this anymore.

01:16:07.546 --> 01:16:10.255
I'm not willing to risk your life
or my life ever again.

01:16:13.088 --> 01:16:14.088
You're giving up?

01:16:15.213 --> 01:16:16.213
On me?

01:16:16.463 --> 01:16:17.463
On Calvin?

01:16:18.588 --> 01:16:21.546
I thought your friends
were like your chosen family.

01:16:23.171 --> 01:16:24.171
You are.

01:16:26.505 --> 01:16:28.713
I can't afford to lose any more.

01:16:37.296 --> 01:16:38.296
You coming?

01:16:39.338 --> 01:16:40.338
Yeah.

01:16:43.713 --> 01:16:44.713
I'm sorry.

01:16:45.005 --> 01:16:47.546
CJ! CJ! What the fuck are you doing?

01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:50.046
Stop! Stop! CJ, don't do this!

01:16:50.838 --> 01:16:52.630
Stop! CJ!

01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:07.796
Okay.

01:17:10.088 --> 01:17:11.088
Five...

01:17:11.838 --> 01:17:13.880
Where are the...
Where are the keys to the garage?

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.005
...four...

01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:16.838
Boy, what is wrong with you?

01:17:16.921 --> 01:17:17.963
...three...

01:17:19.046 --> 01:17:20.046
CJ...

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.046
I love you, Sebastian.
