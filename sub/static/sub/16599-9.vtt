10:28.161 --> 10:29.260
(sighs heavily)

10:29.262 --> 10:31.029
To, uh... be continued.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.163
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.298
KONO:
<i> I checked Susie's e-mail</i>

10:33.300 --> 10:35.634
and phone, and I also
contacted her family

10:35.636 --> 10:37.135
in Baltimore.
On the surface,

10:37.137 --> 10:38.703
there's nothing
strange going on.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.739
No threats, no apparent enemies.
Well,

10:40.741 --> 10:42.641
looks like, for now,
we're still...

10:42.643 --> 10:44.643
just stuck
with Jerry's JFK theory.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.378
Which I hope we can all agree
is ludicrous.

10:46.380 --> 10:47.846
All right, all right, look,

10:47.848 --> 10:49.180
Jerry said that Susie was here

10:49.182 --> 10:50.915
investigating
the Kennedy assassination.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.351
Right? Then all of a sudden
she turns up dead?

10:53.353 --> 10:54.886
You don't find that timing
a little bit suspicious?

10:54.887 --> 10:56.420
Okay, let's say you believe
in the conspiracy theories,

10:56.423 --> 10:59.057
which I do not,
it was still 53 years ago.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.892
Right, anyone involved
would either be dead

11:00.894 --> 11:01.893
or pretty close to it.

11:01.895 --> 11:02.894
STEVE:
I agree.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.195
But it's the only lead we have.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.297
We got to run it down, don't we?

11:06.299 --> 11:08.433
I thought you guys
might need a hand.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.901
Hey, Jerry.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.436
STEVE: Jerry, you sure
you're, uh, you sure you're

11:11.438 --> 11:14.239
feeling up to it?
Yeah, I want to help.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.340
Okay.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.275
Let's see what you got, buddy.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.380
(electronic beep)
All right.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.917
On November 22nd, 1963,
we all know what happened.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.452
President Kennedy is
assassinated in Dallas

11:27.454 --> 11:28.987
and the world is told

11:28.989 --> 11:31.756
that the shooter,
Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.291
But here's something

11:33.293 --> 11:35.060
you probably didn't know.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.228
On the 20th and 21st,
a large number

11:37.230 --> 11:40.065
of high-ranking members
of JFK's administration

11:40.067 --> 11:42.133
were all here on Oahu.
(computer beeping)

11:42.135 --> 11:44.402
These included most
of the Cabinet,

11:44.404 --> 11:46.137
the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs,

11:46.139 --> 11:48.339
and several other top officials.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.942
For two days, they gathered
behind closed doors

11:50.944 --> 11:52.944
at Camp Smith for
what was deemed to be

11:52.946 --> 11:55.814
a conference on Vietnam.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.783
And when the shots rang out that
Friday morning in Dealey Plaza,

11:58.785 --> 12:01.352
most of them were on a plane
bound for Asia.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.353
I did not know about this.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.722
Any of you know about this?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.356
News to me.
I had no idea.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.258
So what, their, uh,
conference was a cover?

12:07.260 --> 12:08.960
Without question.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.795
Susie had posited
that these men,

12:10.797 --> 12:13.331
some of the president's closest,
most trusted advisors,

12:13.333 --> 12:15.300
were all behind
the assassination.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.035
And they'd come to Oahu

12:17.037 --> 12:19.137
to put the final steps
of their plan in motion.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.841
Just... time out
for a second, Jerry, okay?

12:22.843 --> 12:24.242
I can understand pointing
the finger at the the CIA,

12:24.244 --> 12:25.844
even the mafia, okay?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.412
But you said it
yourself, these were

12:27.414 --> 12:30.982
JFK's closest
and most trusted advisors.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.418
Why would JFK's own people

12:33.420 --> 12:35.520
want to eliminate
their commander in chief?

12:35.522 --> 12:36.855
Communism.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.341
Most of them thought

12:39.342 --> 12:41.826
that Kennedy was too soft when
it came to the communist threat.

12:41.828 --> 12:44.362
They wanted to invade Cuba,
escalate the war in Vietnam.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.265
Some of them even wanted to
launch a preemptive strike

12:47.267 --> 12:49.100
against the Soviet Union.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.804
But Kennedy preferred
to use diplomacy over force,

12:52.806 --> 12:55.340
which put him at odds
with most of his inner circle.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.542
But up until now,
there's never been any proof

12:57.544 --> 12:59.477
that they were involved
with his death.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.814
And that is what
Susie came here to get.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.916
For the last few days,
she'd been conducting interviews

13:04.918 --> 13:07.118
with the locals who came
into contact with these men

13:07.120 --> 13:09.354
in the days leading up
to the assassination.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.356
And, right before
she was killed,

13:11.358 --> 13:15.026
she told me that she was close
to proving once and for all

13:15.028 --> 13:17.328
that the LGT was crap.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.863
"LGT?"

13:18.865 --> 13:20.298
Lone Gunman Theory.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.466
Let's just suppose
Susie found something

13:21.468 --> 13:22.867
during her investigation

13:22.869 --> 13:25.203
that actually did
get her killed.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.905
Now, we need to
find out what that is,

13:26.907 --> 13:28.439
which means we need
to retrace her steps.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.910
I can help you out there.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.846
(electronic beeps) According
to the calendar on her phone,

13:34.848 --> 13:37.415
she had two interviews
the morning that she arrived.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.018
The first was with
this gentleman,

13:40.020 --> 13:43.021
George Sellers.

Call for the car.

14:26.299 --> 14:29.334
He left a few minutes later.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.302
I never saw him again.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.137
Must've been a pretty
urgent telegram.

14:33.139 --> 14:36.040
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.909
Why would you say that?

14:37.911 --> 14:39.477
(chuckles)

14:39.479 --> 14:41.246
Well, you have to understand,

14:41.248 --> 14:43.047
he was the most important man

14:43.049 --> 14:45.617
I'd ever met.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.471
"Joseph Eastman looking
for a sure bet at Pimlico?"

15:06.473 --> 15:08.473
Yes, sir.

15:08.475 --> 15:12.110
I guess this Eastman fellow
was playing the ponies.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.479
And you shared
all this with Susie?

15:14.481 --> 15:16.314
Oh, yep.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.949
She seemed just as interested

15:17.951 --> 15:20.118
as you two.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.956
JERRY: <i> There's no way</i>
<i> someone as powerful</i>

15:24.958 --> 15:28.493
as Rusk would get that bent out
of shape over a horse race.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.961
You think that telegram
was a coded message.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.663
Of course.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.364
Considering what Rusk
and his buddies were plotting,

15:33.366 --> 15:35.099
it makes sense that
any written communication

15:35.101 --> 15:36.534
would have to be encrypted.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.036
You know what,
first of all, we don't know

15:38.038 --> 15:39.437
where that message was from.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.272
Second of all,
we're talking about Dean Rusk,

15:41.274 --> 15:42.440
the Secretary of State.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.708
That could've been
a sensitive message

15:43.710 --> 15:45.610
about any number of topics.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.245
For all we know,
it had nothing to do

15:47.247 --> 15:49.013
with the Kennedy assassination.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.183
You don't buy Susie's theory,
do you?

15:52.185 --> 15:54.285
You know what, Jer?
I got to say...

15:54.287 --> 15:56.487
I don't.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.990
At least not yet.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.995
MAX: <i> Now, gentlemen, if you'll</i>
<i> kindly gather around...</i>

16:06.466 --> 16:08.166
(electronic beeping)
All right.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.168
Based on the position of
the exit and entry wound,

16:10.170 --> 16:11.636
Ms. Freeling's height,

16:11.638 --> 16:13.338
and knowing the direction
that she fell,

16:13.340 --> 16:14.339
we could accurately determine

16:14.341 --> 16:17.442
the bullet's point of origin.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.415
DANNY:
All right, well, that explains

16:24.417 --> 16:27.418
why HPD didn't
find a sniper's perch.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.587
Yeah, 'cause the shooter
didn't have a perch.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.389
All right, I'm thinking
a vehicle, right?

16:31.391 --> 16:33.975
He pulls up to the curb,

16:33.976 --> 16:36.560
waits for a shot, takes it and
leaves amid the confusion.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.696
I will have Sgt. Lukela pull the
traffic footage. (laser powers down)

16:38.698 --> 16:40.698
There also seems to be an ATM
camera across the street,

16:40.700 --> 16:42.100
perhaps that could be
of help as well.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.434
DANNY:
Oh, what about, a...

16:43.436 --> 16:45.003
what about a weapon?

16:45.004 --> 16:46.571
I actually have some information
on that as well.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.039
The bullet that killed
Ms. Freeling

16:48.041 --> 16:50.241
appears to be a 7.62x51,

16:50.243 --> 16:52.076
an ammunition that's
consistent with...

16:52.078 --> 16:53.478
M40.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.213
That is correct.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.781
DANNY:
What? What about it?

16:56.783 --> 17:02.053
M40 is a... it's standard issue
for all U.S. military snipers.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.455
So, is the implication that,
here in broad daylight,

17:04.457 --> 17:06.190
in front of dozens of people,

17:06.192 --> 17:08.626
our government kills a citizen

17:08.628 --> 17:11.062
over something that
happened 53 years ago?

17:11.064 --> 17:14.399
I don't know, man.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.740
Can I help you gentlemen
with something?

17:22.742 --> 17:24.475
Those are her clothes.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.209
Make sure we get those.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

17:26.212 --> 17:27.779
You can't just...
Actually, we can.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.347
Agent Ward. FBI.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.349
I'm gonna need you
to turn over all evidence

17:31.351 --> 17:33.084
in the murder of Susan Freeling.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.452
What are you talking about?
This is Five-O's case.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.220
Not anymore.
Okay.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.672
We'll see about that.
(phone dialing, then rings)

17:37.673 --> 17:39.123
Yeah, Uncle D, you want to get
down here right away?

17:39.125 --> 17:42.060
I got people in my lab
seizing evidence.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.094
Maybe I wasn't clear.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.263
This is now an
FBI investigation.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.330
Do yourself a favor
and don't get in our way.

18:04.818 --> 18:07.185
Get back in your car, Commander.
No, I don't think so.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.287
Why don't you tell me why
the FBI's taking over this case?

18:09.289 --> 18:10.655
It's a local matter.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.356
Actually, it's a federal one.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.591
No, the victim was, uh,

18:13.593 --> 18:15.293
not a federal employee.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.761
So this is
a straight-up murder case.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.296
I'm not sure why you think
I'm obliged

18:18.298 --> 18:20.131
to share any
information with you.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.432
Hey, listen, pal, one of our
people watched his friend

18:21.434 --> 18:23.234
get shot and killed
this morning.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.670
So you're gonna have to do better
than that. Actually, I don't.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.572
Unless you want to
face federal charges

18:27.574 --> 18:29.307
for obstruction of justice,

18:29.309 --> 18:32.710
you'll stand down right now.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.145
(engine starts)

18:34.147 --> 18:35.813
Buddy, you-you handled that

18:35.815 --> 18:39.150
with the utmost maturity
and professionalism.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.453
I was very, very surprised.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.456
We're not gonna, uh,
stand down, are we?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.726
Nope.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.161
FBI.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.913
Why am I not surprised?

18:51.914 --> 18:53.664
They're gonna try and cover this up.
Wait a minute.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.466
You've been saying this
whole time that it was the CIA

18:55.468 --> 18:57.602
and the Joint Chiefs who
were behind the assassination.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.371
They were, but the FBI were the
ones who processed the evidence

19:00.373 --> 19:01.506
out of Dallas.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.241
And if they bungled
the investigation,

19:03.243 --> 19:04.642
or part of the cover-up,

19:04.644 --> 19:06.344
that's something they
wouldn't want to get out.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.613
Like... ever.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.214
That's why they're
all over this.

19:10.216 --> 19:11.816
They were probably
in Susie's hotel room.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.652
Bet you anything
they got her laptop.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.188
All right, what do we
know about this guy Mauli?

19:17.190 --> 19:18.756
Only that he's been
shining shoes in this hotel

19:18.758 --> 19:21.626
since, like, before
Hawaii was even a state.

19:21.628 --> 19:25.163
(rotary phone dialing,
then dings)

19:35.608 --> 19:38.209
Another shine, sir?

19:38.211 --> 19:41.379
No, but I need you to do
something for me.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.447
If that phone rings,
you answer it, understand?

19:43.449 --> 19:45.183
You tell the person
on the other end

19:45.185 --> 19:48.586
to wait, then come get me
in my room.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.656
348.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.324
Got it?

19:53.326 --> 19:55.426
Yes, sir.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.496
MAULI: <i> And that was</i>
<i> the last time I saw</i>

19:58.498 --> 20:01.332
<i> Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.</i>

20:01.334 --> 20:04.202
Was there anything else
you told Susie?

20:04.204 --> 20:05.870
No, I'm sorry.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.272
That's all she wanted to know.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.374
CHIN:
<i> I'll admit it's curious.</i>

20:10.376 --> 20:11.676
Just curious?

20:11.678 --> 20:13.411
Lodge had a phone in his room.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.313
The hotel had
several house phones.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.981
The only reason you use
a pay phone in the lobby

20:16.983 --> 20:18.783
is 'cause you don't
want a record of the call.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.318
Well, still,
all we know for sure

20:20.320 --> 20:21.686
is that we got a couple
of Cabinet members

20:21.688 --> 20:22.954
who were working really hard

20:22.955 --> 20:24.221
to keep their
communications private.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.390
That's hardly a reason
to kill somebody.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.826
Okay, I guess you have
a point there.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.528
We got to find out who else
Susie talked to

20:30.530 --> 20:32.797
other than Mauli and George.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.765
Right.
You know what? Let's do this.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.568
Let's put ourselves
in their shoes, all right?

20:37.570 --> 20:39.270
So, she found the beach club

20:39.272 --> 20:40.838
where Rusk was hanging out.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.707
She visited the hotel
where Lodge was staying.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.842
If you're her,
where else do you go?

20:44.844 --> 20:46.811
Camp Smith.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.412
Where the conference
was being held.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.680
They didn't just hold
the conference there.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.282
That's also where
they all stayed.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.583
Except for Lodge.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.519
Sounds like it's
worth checking out.

20:56.956 --> 21:01.859
(car engine starts, motor revs)

21:01.861 --> 21:05.696
What is it?

21:05.698 --> 21:07.598
I've been hanging out with you
too long.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.733
Is that a good thing
or bad thing?

21:08.735 --> 21:10.935
Both.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.738
KONO: <i> All right, so I went through</i>
<i> the ATM and traffic footage</i>

21:13.740 --> 21:15.323
<i> from the area</i>

21:15.324 --> 21:16.907
around Kapiolani Park,
and I think this is

21:16.909 --> 21:18.376
the vehicle
that our shooter used.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.744
It was parked on Kapahulu
and it took off

21:19.746 --> 21:21.479
just after Susie was shot.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.580
It's perfect.

21:22.582 --> 21:23.781
Spacious, tinted windows.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.750
This could definitely be
a sniper's hide.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.618
Yeah, and that's not all.
I just checked--

21:27.620 --> 21:29.420
the owner reported it stolen
this morning.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.554
Okay, you got HPD on this?

21:30.556 --> 21:32.156
I just put out the BOLO.

21:32.157 --> 21:33.757
All right, listen to me,
the sniper would've dumped it

21:33.758 --> 21:35.358
somewhere nearby, okay,
so you make sure they comb

21:35.361 --> 21:37.295
every square inch of every
block around that park.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.330
I mean, every lot,
every parking garage.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.399
I don't care what it takes,
we need to find that minivan.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.900
Copy that.

21:42.902 --> 21:46.070
Your friend came here
looking for any footage

21:46.072 --> 21:48.072
of the Cabinet
that may have been shot

21:48.074 --> 21:50.041
for the Armed Forces Network.

21:50.043 --> 21:52.376
Said she would file
a Freedom of Information Act

21:52.378 --> 21:54.345
if she didn't get it.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.781
So since I was the base's
cameraman back then,

21:56.783 --> 21:58.516
brass tells me
to get over here

21:58.518 --> 22:00.418
and dig it out.

22:00.420 --> 22:04.588
Well, I may be retired, but
I still can't refuse an order.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.491
Yep, here we go.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.808
JERRY:
There's Rusk.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.776
And that's General Taylor,

22:25.778 --> 22:26.944
Kennedy's chairman
of the Joint Chiefs.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.180
CHIN:
Okay, I see 'em,

22:29.181 --> 22:31.415
but how are we suppose
to know what they're saying?

22:39.092 --> 22:41.826
"Juicy rhymes met...

22:41.828 --> 22:43.961
"Captain Kirk...

22:45.398 --> 22:47.064
That's a dope pantsuit."

22:47.066 --> 22:49.700
We might need a lip reader.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.404
JERRY: "Taylor: 'I still
don't like what I'm hearing

22:53.406 --> 22:55.273
"about the operation.'

22:55.274 --> 22:57.141
"Rusk: 'You never like what
you hear about operations

22:57.143 --> 22:58.976
"'you don't directly oversee.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.578
"'You're just going to
have to trust our team

23:00.580 --> 23:01.979
"to get this done.'

23:01.981 --> 23:05.449
"Taylor: 'Just promise me it
won't come back to bite us.'

23:05.451 --> 23:08.986
"Rusk: 'I give you every
assurance, General.

23:08.988 --> 23:12.790
"'When the world reads
his obituary...

23:18.931 --> 23:22.600
...all the blame will fall
on the Cubans.'"

23:22.602 --> 23:25.803
Busted!
Right?

23:25.805 --> 23:27.171
I think I need
to sit down.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.006
You are sitting, Jer.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.609
Then I need to stand up.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.546
I mean, this has to be it.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.747
The smoking gun.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.750
This is...
This is the evidence

23:39.752 --> 23:41.519
that Susie told me about.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.996
You realize what
we have here, Chin?

23:51.998 --> 23:53.697
This is a game-changer.

23:53.699 --> 23:55.699
They're gonna have to
rewrite the history books.

23:55.701 --> 23:56.901
Like, all of them.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.069
All right, well, just
explain something to me.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.671
If they pulled off
the assassination

24:00.673 --> 24:02.072
and planned to blame
the Cubans,

24:02.074 --> 24:04.975
then why was the public told
that Oswald acted alone?

24:07.580 --> 24:08.913
Ruby.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.881
You mean Jack Ruby,
the guy who killed Oswald?

24:10.883 --> 24:13.484
Yeah, Ruby blew
the whole plan.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.052
See, a week before
the assassination,

24:15.054 --> 24:17.855
Oswald actually visited
the Cuban embassy in Mexico.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.990
I bet you anything
that was just a ruse.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.859
That way, after
they caught him,

24:21.860 --> 24:23.727
he could pretend to crack
under the interrogation,

24:23.729 --> 24:25.996
yell,<i> " OahuViva la revolución!"</i>
and boom--

24:25.998 --> 24:28.666
the Cabinet and Joint Chiefs
have everything they wanted.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.168
And the U.S. has an excuse
to invade Cuba.

24:31.170 --> 24:34.205
Yeah. But Oswald was
shot to death by Ruby,

24:34.207 --> 24:36.874
and those bastards had
to cut their losses.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.110
JERRY:
Chin, what is it?

24:40.112 --> 24:41.612
CHIN: I think that guy's
been following us.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.649
Stay here.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.051
Hey!

25:16.048 --> 25:18.582
Who was that guy?

25:18.584 --> 25:21.118
I don't know, but he was
outside the hotel earlier, too.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.288
Well, whoever he is,
he left this.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.726
"4:30. Come alone."

25:28.728 --> 25:30.694
Please take me with you.

25:30.696 --> 25:31.762
Come on.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.203
Morning, gentlemen.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.105
Welcome to Duke's.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.174
So who are you?

26:17.176 --> 26:20.277
My name is Drake.
Please, sit.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.012
Can I get you a drink?

26:22.014 --> 26:24.081
It's a little bit
early for us.

26:24.083 --> 26:27.017
Aw, this used
to be more fun.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.919
Anyway, I'm sorry
for all the theatrics,

26:28.921 --> 26:31.655
but meeting with this
young man in public

26:31.657 --> 26:33.824
has proved detrimental
to one's health lately.

26:33.826 --> 26:36.193
So Susie contacted you?

26:36.195 --> 26:39.296
We never met in person,
but somehow she got the word

26:39.298 --> 26:40.764
that I was the man to see

26:40.766 --> 26:43.734
about decoding an encrypted
message from 1963.

26:43.736 --> 26:47.671
Breaking old ciphers is
something of a hobby of mine.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.239
Well, I politely declined,

26:49.241 --> 26:52.876
hoping she would drop
the investigation.

26:52.878 --> 26:55.779
She obviously didn't.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.648
When I heard what happened,

26:57.650 --> 26:59.183
I thought it best
to come forward.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.819
This is the message about
Joseph Eastman and Pimlico?

27:01.821 --> 27:03.020
Yes.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.255
But once deciphered,
it was a warning.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.825
A warning?
About what?

27:07.827 --> 27:09.960
Me.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.363
From '61 to '72,

27:12.365 --> 27:14.832
I was Hoover's man in Honolulu.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.635
You worked for the FBI?
Not officially.

27:17.637 --> 27:20.704
Officially I was the manager
of Duke Kahanamoku's nightclub.

27:20.706 --> 27:22.773
But the Bureau
recruited me because

27:22.775 --> 27:25.075
everyone we were spying on
passed through Duke's

27:25.077 --> 27:26.677
when they were in town.

27:26.679 --> 27:29.313
Mobsters,
foreign dignitaries.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.981
You know, politicians.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.416
All right, so then
I'm guessing

27:32.417 --> 27:33.850
the Cabinet avoided Duke's
when they were here, right?

27:33.853 --> 27:36.120
Quite the contrary.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.088
See, the message was
light on details.

27:38.090 --> 27:41.892
All it said was,
"FBI has a spy on Oahu.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.727
Take precautions."

27:43.729 --> 27:46.997
And apparently the Cabinet
did take some precautions.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.866
But they just weren't
quite as careful

27:48.868 --> 27:50.401
as they should have been.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.926
CHIN (on phone):
<i> So it turns out</i>

31:35.928 --> 31:37.628
that Kamele Hale died
eight months ago--

31:37.630 --> 31:40.264
natural causes, no next of kin.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.132
She'd been renting
a house in Ewa beach,

31:42.134 --> 31:44.034
but before that she'd
moved around a lot.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.636
She even lived under
a few aliases.

31:45.638 --> 31:47.371
STEVE:
Okay, that means

31:47.372 --> 31:49.105
whatever secrets she was
able to learn that night

31:49.108 --> 31:50.240
have gone to
the grave with her.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.809
JERRY:
But we know now

31:51.810 --> 31:53.377
that the FBI was
spying on the Cabinet.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.245
Which means they may
have had advance knowledge

31:55.247 --> 31:56.647
of the assassination,

31:56.649 --> 31:58.982
which means they
let it happen.

31:58.984 --> 32:00.984
They were complicit.

32:00.986 --> 32:02.586
All right,
hold on a second.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.154
Look, I know how it sounds,

32:04.156 --> 32:05.622
but Hoover had it out
for the Kennedys

32:05.624 --> 32:08.258
since before JFK took office.

32:08.260 --> 32:12.029
Jer, are we really saying
that the FBI actually

32:12.031 --> 32:13.964
killed Susie because she was
getting too close to the truth?

32:13.966 --> 32:15.666
Yes.
STEVE: Hang on, guys.

32:15.668 --> 32:17.434
HPD found the minivan.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.201
It was towed from the parking
garage of a building downtown

32:19.204 --> 32:20.704
to an impound lot
on Frenchman Street.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.439
Okay, tell the impound boys
not to touch it

32:22.441 --> 32:23.924
and have CSU meet us there.

32:23.925 --> 32:25.408
If we're lucky, the shooter
left us a little something

32:25.411 --> 32:26.410
to help ID him.
All right?

32:26.412 --> 32:27.411
Copy that.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.612
Guys, listen,

32:28.614 --> 32:29.663
we may have a lead
on our shooter.

32:29.664 --> 32:30.713
Call me back if you find
anything else.

32:30.716 --> 32:31.982
CHIN: Copy.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.956
JERRY:<i> According to the executor</i>
<i> of her estate,</i>

32:38.958 --> 32:41.124
your store purchased
all the possessions

32:41.126 --> 32:43.293
left behind by
a Ms. Kamele Hale.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.294
Is that right?

32:44.296 --> 32:46.163
Hmm, the name sounds familiar.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.497
Let me check on that for you.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.471
I don't know, Jer, this place
seems like a long shot.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.173
Wouldn't get your hopes up.

32:56.175 --> 32:59.710
Chin, the FBI had Kamele
spy on the Cabinet.

32:59.712 --> 33:01.311
The next day, JFK is killed

33:01.313 --> 33:03.046
and she immediately
goes into hiding.

33:03.048 --> 33:05.248
Obviously, she was
afraid for her life.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.985
So it makes sense she didn't
hand over that tape.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.086
She probably figured
that recording

33:09.088 --> 33:10.721
might've been her only leverage.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.256
All right, let's see.
This is her stuff

33:13.258 --> 33:14.624
that didn't sell.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.059
Uh, I was gonna donate it

33:16.061 --> 33:17.311
to Goodwill.
Uh, let me know

33:17.312 --> 33:18.562
if you need anything else, okay?
Thank you.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.630
Mahalo.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.385
No way.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.140
Feds took all the
evidence that we had.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.409
Now took all the evidence
that we were gonna have.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.110
I'd say screw it,
let's go get a couple beers,

34:07.112 --> 34:10.247
but they'd probably show up
and take those, too.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.382
STEVE: Danny. DANNY: I see it.

34:15.254 --> 34:18.055
Stop!
Get out of the car.

34:19.758 --> 34:21.058
Out.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.528
That's right, keep your hands
where I can see them.

34:24.530 --> 34:25.695
Put your hands
behind your head,

34:25.697 --> 34:26.696
interlock your fingers.

34:26.698 --> 34:29.199
Turn around.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.439
All right.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.442
I knew you wouldn't let it go.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.544
Yeah? Well done, Commander.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.245
I already had you on
obstruction of justice.

34:42.247 --> 34:44.648
Now we can tack on
a few more charges.

34:44.650 --> 34:45.816
You had us
on obstruction?

34:45.818 --> 34:48.151
That's, uh...
that's funny.

34:48.153 --> 34:50.220
That's evidence in a
federal investigation.

34:50.222 --> 34:51.855
You can't touch that.

35:00.866 --> 35:04.234
She died on your watch
and you did nothing to stop it.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.302
Turn around.

35:16.849 --> 35:18.248
STEVE:
<i> Why were you following</i>

35:18.250 --> 35:19.616
Susie Freeling?

35:21.887 --> 35:24.554
Play this out, Commander.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.123
You've detained a federal agent

35:26.125 --> 35:28.391
without cause.

35:28.393 --> 35:31.261
In what universe
does that end well for you?

35:31.263 --> 35:32.829
Without cause?

35:32.831 --> 35:34.798
How about you sitting
on your ass, snapping photos,

35:34.800 --> 35:35.799
while an innocent woman

35:35.801 --> 35:36.833
gets shot to death

35:36.835 --> 35:38.301
in broad daylight?

35:38.303 --> 35:40.704
How about that for cause?

35:40.706 --> 35:42.372
I asked you a question.
I'm gonna ask you again.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.508
Why were you following
Susie Freeling?

35:44.510 --> 35:46.376
Had she done
something wrong?

35:46.378 --> 35:49.379
Was she in some kind of danger?

35:52.184 --> 35:53.450
Oh, okay, all right.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.552
How about this then?

35:55.554 --> 35:57.821
I don't care who you work for.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.757
Right now you're in a bunker
four stories underground.

36:00.759 --> 36:03.760
Nobody knows you're here
and you're not getting out

36:03.762 --> 36:05.896
until you tell me
what I want to know.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.802
All right.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.272
You want to know
what this was all about?

36:15.274 --> 36:17.240
I'll tell you.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.747
Steve get anywhere
with Agent Ward?

36:23.749 --> 36:26.650
He's working on it.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.451
All right, bring it in,
everybody, come on.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.925
(ukulele playing)

36:36.862 --> 36:40.764
So, I say to Elvis, I say,
"King, why don't you try

36:40.766 --> 36:42.365
my ukulele?"

36:42.367 --> 36:44.367
And he says, "Don, you know

36:44.369 --> 36:47.637
what they say about entertainers
with small guitars."

36:47.639 --> 36:49.706
(laughter)

36:51.777 --> 36:53.810
I don't really
follow politics,

36:53.812 --> 36:56.179
but I did watch
that debate.

36:56.180 --> 36:58.547
That poor Nixon, sweating
under all those hot lights.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.549
Looked like
he was gonna

36:59.551 --> 37:00.650
pass out.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.385
(laughter)

37:02.387 --> 37:03.820
And the president,
you know,

37:03.822 --> 37:06.523
so handsome, so confident.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.658
Will he be visiting
Hawaii again?

37:08.660 --> 37:11.261
I'm... not sure.

37:11.263 --> 37:13.396
He barely won this state
the first time.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.765
All the more reason
to come back.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.402
Oh, I'm on again in five.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.271
Better go powder my nose.

37:21.273 --> 37:23.406
You already look
like a dream.

37:23.408 --> 37:26.276
And you look like
you could use another mai tai.

37:26.278 --> 37:27.310
(laughing)

37:27.312 --> 37:28.678
Make sure mine
doesn't go anywhere.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.946
I'll be back.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.749
MAN:
We'll be here.

37:35.454 --> 37:36.453
(whistles)

37:36.455 --> 37:38.788
She is a looker, that one.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.958
Can we please get
back to business?

37:41.960 --> 37:45.595
So, what did
this general say?

37:45.597 --> 37:47.197
Just more of the same.

37:47.198 --> 37:48.798
The chiefs have little faith
in the CIA's ability

37:48.800 --> 37:50.667
to pull off
a clean assassination.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.402
They're about
to be proven wrong.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.536
Yes...

37:53.538 --> 37:56.306
and God willing, years from now

37:56.308 --> 37:57.540
historians will look back

37:57.542 --> 37:59.976
and say Operation Mongoose
did more to ensure

37:59.978 --> 38:01.578
this country's security

38:01.580 --> 38:04.314
than the bombings
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.917
♪ They fondly say to me... ♪

38:07.919 --> 38:10.403
GROVER:
Wow.

38:10.404 --> 38:12.888
Operation Mongoose, so that's
the op that killed Kennedy?

38:12.891 --> 38:14.324
No.

38:14.326 --> 38:16.059
(music stops)

38:17.029 --> 38:18.495
Operation Mongoose

38:18.497 --> 38:20.964
was the Cabinet
and the Joint Chiefs' campaign

38:20.966 --> 38:24.034
to remove Fidel Castro
from power.

38:24.036 --> 38:26.303
It wasn't Kennedy's
assassination

38:26.305 --> 38:27.570
they were planning at all.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.973
It was... Castro's.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.987
She died thinking
she'd solved it.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.995
I don't know if that's
a good thing or a bad thing.

38:53.565 --> 38:56.366
She died knowing
that she had a friend

38:56.368 --> 38:57.701
who would finish
what she started.

38:57.703 --> 39:00.103
(cell phone vibrating)

39:00.105 --> 39:02.539
Steve.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.940
Yeah, I'll tell him.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.842
Thanks.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.981
Agent Ward
gave up everything.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.484
Susie was targeted
for something else

39:14.486 --> 39:16.386
she was looking into.

39:16.388 --> 39:19.422
Not only that, they already
ID'd the shooter.

39:19.424 --> 39:21.591
They know who killed her?

39:21.593 --> 39:24.461
Yeah, and they know where he is.

39:26.431 --> 39:27.497
STEVE:
Five-O! Stop!

39:28.600 --> 39:30.633
(groans)

39:31.870 --> 39:34.104
Ronan Scuderi,
you're under arrest

39:34.106 --> 39:35.939
for the murder
of Susie Freeling.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.641
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

39:43.115 --> 39:44.848
We brought the shooter in.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.851
That's a strange reaction.

39:47.853 --> 39:49.586
People around here are usually,
uh...

39:49.588 --> 39:52.122
happy to see a killer
brought to justice.

39:52.124 --> 39:54.090
You closed one murder.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.593
There was a reason we
were sitting on him.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.762
We were building
this case for months!

39:58.764 --> 39:59.896
That's right, you were.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.831
A case you would never have had

40:01.833 --> 40:04.167
if it wasn't for Susie Freeling.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.836
That chemical company
she was looking into?

40:06.838 --> 40:09.506
They weren't even
on the FBI's radar, were they?

40:09.508 --> 40:11.474
You told me yourself,

40:11.476 --> 40:14.611
she came to you,
told you what they were up to.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.080
If it wasn't for her,
you would never have had it.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.749
Did he tell you anything?

40:19.751 --> 40:21.017
Yes, he did.

40:21.019 --> 40:23.019
He told me everything.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.788
Then he gave us his CEO.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.489
He said he was told

40:26.491 --> 40:29.109
that Susie was
getting too close.

40:29.110 --> 40:31.728
She needed to be silenced
before she could go public.

40:31.730 --> 40:34.097
Unfortunately, she trusted you
instead of going public.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.100
If she hadn't had done that
maybe she'd still be alive.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.504
(lock buzzes, door opens)

40:41.506 --> 40:43.173
KENNEDY:
<i> A very, uh, warm</i>

40:43.175 --> 40:47.577
aloha at being back here
in Hawaii.

40:47.579 --> 40:50.747
And to tell you that I come

40:50.749 --> 40:53.483
from another part
of the United States,

40:53.485 --> 40:55.552
6,000 miles away...

40:55.554 --> 40:57.754
and we are proud of this city

40:57.756 --> 40:58.922
and this state.
Hey.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.990
Hey.

41:03.195 --> 41:05.628
(sighs)
I just, uh...

41:05.630 --> 41:08.198
I just wanted to swing by,
see how you're doing.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.133
You all right?

41:10.135 --> 41:12.602
You know.

41:14.206 --> 41:16.873
Yeah.

41:16.875 --> 41:20.143
I'm just...
really gonna miss her.

41:22.747 --> 41:25.548
She was the only person
I could talk to about the things

41:25.550 --> 41:28.485
that the rest of the world
would think were crazy.

41:28.487 --> 41:31.221
The Bilderberg Group.

41:31.223 --> 41:34.757
Paul McCartney's decoy.
Apollo 11.

41:34.759 --> 41:37.260
Although, we did have some major
disagreements on that one.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.261
Let me guess.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.562
Susie thought we actually

41:39.564 --> 41:41.598
did go to the moon?

41:41.600 --> 41:42.765
No, she just didn't think that

41:42.767 --> 41:44.868
Kubrick was involved
in faking it.

41:44.870 --> 41:47.070
Ah.

41:47.072 --> 41:49.105
Well, I'll tell you what, Jerry,
I'll make you a deal.

41:49.107 --> 41:52.575
Next time you feel like sharing,
coffee's on me.

41:52.577 --> 41:54.077
All right?

41:54.079 --> 41:57.714
Now listen, I can't promise
I'll-I'll agree with you...

41:57.716 --> 42:00.250
ever, but I, uh,

42:00.252 --> 42:02.919
I won't think you're crazy.

42:03.855 --> 42:06.589
Thanks, Commander.

42:06.591 --> 42:08.558
Yes, sir.

42:11.730 --> 42:14.564
Is that from his visit?

42:14.566 --> 42:15.798
Yeah.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.100
Did you know he was
the first president

42:17.102 --> 42:18.835
to visit
the<i> Arizona</i> Memorial?

42:18.837 --> 42:20.136
I did.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.238
Did you know that
every single president after him

42:22.240 --> 42:24.541
followed his lead?
Mm-hmm.

42:24.543 --> 42:26.743
He was quite the man.

42:27.712 --> 42:30.046
Yeah, he was.

42:31.016 --> 42:34.284
...on a matter
which concerns us all,

42:34.286 --> 42:39.055
and that is how the American
people can live more happily

42:39.057 --> 42:41.758
and more securely together.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.293
<i> And there is no place</i>

42:43.295 --> 42:44.894
<i> where it is more</i>

42:44.896 --> 42:47.230
<i> appropriately said</i>
<i> and understood</i>

42:47.232 --> 42:49.299
<i> than in this part</i>
<i> of the United States,</i>

42:49.301 --> 42:51.034
<i> here on this island.</i>

42:51.036 --> 42:53.803
(crowd cheers and applauds)

42:56.074 --> 42:58.341
<i> Reaching into the Pacific,</i>

42:58.343 --> 43:01.177
<i>this part of the United States,</i>

43:01.179 --> 43:05.848
<i> this island represents</i>
<i> all that we are...</i>

43:05.850 --> 43:06.916
<i> and all that we hope to be.</i>
