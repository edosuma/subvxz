WEBVTT

01:59.285 --> 02:03.163
Diane, it's 6:42 a.m.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.125
Rough sleep.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.130
I had dreamt I was eating a large,
tasteless gumdrop.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.674
I awoke to realize
that I was aggressively munching

02:13.883 --> 02:16.802
on one of my Air-Pillow
silicone earplugs.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.346
Hence the tastelessness.

02:20.348 --> 02:24.393
Perhaps I should keep a closer eye
on my after-dinner coffee consumption.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.399
Persistent soreness in the rib area,

02:30.608 --> 02:34.570
which I'm treating each morning with
15 extra minutes of yogic discipline.

02:34.779 --> 02:39.825
After which, thankfully,
the pain retreats to a cul-de-sac

02:39.993 --> 02:43.328
in a distant suburb
of my conscious mind.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.542
I'm going to begin today
with a headstand.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.094
Diane, I am now upside down.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.767
Mind becoming porous.

03:06.394 --> 03:12.232
The day's tasks coming into focus.
Objects growing clearer.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.544
Diane, the Giant was right.
I did forget something.

03:37.717 --> 03:41.803
"I've gone north. Jack may have
the answer. Love, Audrey."

04:01.658 --> 04:04.618
Hey. Thought we'd lost you
to the Kalispell woods.

04:04.827 --> 04:08.914
Two retired female schoolteachers
live in that house next to the Palmers.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.708
They have no memory
of a gray-haired man.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.670
I had to drink three pots
of chamomile tea to find that out.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.171
- Hmm.
- Which reminds me.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.798
Would you excuse me for a minute?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.007
- Sure.
- Thanks.

04:19.175 --> 04:22.010
Mm. Keep looking for the
one-armed man. We gotta find him.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.763
Excuse me, sheriff,
I just wanted to say goodbye

04:24.973 --> 04:28.100
because, as you know,
I'm going down to Tacoma for two days

04:28.309 --> 04:31.228
to visit my sister Gwen
and her husband, Larry,

04:31.396 --> 04:32.729
who had a baby last week.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.732
- Right.
- That is, Gwen had the baby.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.486
Larry's the father.
You remember? It was a boy.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.906
Well, anyway, as soon as
the Can-Do temp girl gets here,

04:43.116 --> 04:45.826
I'll explain the phones
and the coffee and the intercom...

04:46.035 --> 04:47.661
- Lucy, it's okay.
- And the wag...

04:47.870 --> 04:49.579
We got it covered.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.207
No, she should've
been here by now.

04:52.417 --> 04:57.713
- I can stay and at least show her...
- Lucy, don't worry. Just go.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.675
Sometimes the Can-Do girls can't.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.263
- But, sheriff...
- We got it covered.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.601
Have a safe trip, Lucy.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.812
Thank you.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.064
- Morning, Coop.
- Harry.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.025
What is the word
on our delivery tonight?

05:18.192 --> 05:20.944
We won't need it.
We've got the jump on them.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.655
I know where Audrey is.

05:26.868 --> 05:30.662
You see, the Port-O-Patient
will allow you to fluently, uh, transport

05:30.872 --> 05:32.664
the unfortunate Mr. Johnson,

05:32.874 --> 05:36.501
uh, allowing him to even go outside,

05:36.711 --> 05:40.756
and sit and experience
what he can of nature.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.841
- Mr. Pinkle, I want my cousin Leo
- Mm-hm?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.594
to have the fullest possible
experience of life.

05:45.803 --> 05:50.932
Well, that's what we're here for. Heh.
Okay, let's give it one more.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.268
Mr. Pinkle,
are you gonna install the ramp?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.812
Well, sure, of course, of course.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.608
Uh, as a matter of fact,
I already have some...

05:59.776 --> 06:00.942
Some plywood ramp...

06:01.152 --> 06:04.738
Pinewood ramp boards
that I'll install tomorrow. Absolutely.

06:04.947 --> 06:09.576
That's a very good suggestion.
Now, I think we are ready to go.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.371
Finally. There we go. All right?

06:17.168 --> 06:18.502
That's a new wrinkle.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.505
I can't believe it. It was working
just so perfectly yesterday.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.923
Come on. Come on...

06:23.091 --> 06:25.675
You gotta be tough with this thing.
You gotta hit it hard.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.930
A machine is like a woman, we always
say at the machine shop. Come on.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.394
Oh, Bobby, are you okay?

06:36.312 --> 06:39.398
Shelly, could you get Mr. Pinkle
a cold drink, please?

06:39.607 --> 06:41.691
A diet soda, please.
That would be great.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.944
Pinkle, Pinkle, Pinkle.

06:44.153 --> 06:47.280
This thing is a death trap.
I told you we have to keep him alive.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.367
The insurance companies
don't exactly pay off like the slots.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.743
After we take our cuts,

06:51.911 --> 06:55.205
we had only money for this
or a first-rate wheelbarrow.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.167
Oh, thank you very much.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.920
Oh, thanks a lot.

07:02.547 --> 07:03.880
Bobby?

07:08.678 --> 07:12.806
- I've gotta meet Leo's lawyer.
- The hearing's today, right?

07:13.015 --> 07:16.101
Be just another second, folks.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.729
Bobby...

07:21.107 --> 07:23.150
...are we okay?

07:32.326 --> 07:35.579
Oh, that's it.
Come and take a look. You can see it.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.080
It works just fine.

07:38.374 --> 07:41.293
Come outside with me.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.881
He can let himself out.

07:46.090 --> 07:50.218
Bobby, we're doing real good.
Okay, that's enough. Um...

07:54.182 --> 07:55.557
Bobby? Uh...

07:56.976 --> 08:01.021
Bob, Bob, I can't reach the switch.
Bobby, I've got a problem here.

08:12.241 --> 08:16.036
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty

08:16.204 --> 08:18.663
to the charge
of murder in the first degree.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.333
The defense has requested bail.

08:21.542 --> 08:26.713
This pre-trial hearing is to determine
whether that bail will be granted.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.341
Mr. Prosecutor.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.927
We, the people
of the State of Washington,

08:32.094 --> 08:35.180
move the defendant be denied bail.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.140
On the basis of one,

08:37.350 --> 08:40.602
the great seriousness of the crime
for which he has been accused.

08:40.811 --> 08:45.273
Two, the apparently
premeditated nature of this act.

08:45.483 --> 08:49.903
And three, the oft-witnessed
instability of Mr. Palmer

08:50.071 --> 08:53.365
during the period
following the death of his daughter.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.411
Sheriff Truman will speak
for the defense.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.915
Your Honor,

09:03.167 --> 09:07.045
Leland Palmer
is a well-known, well-liked,

09:07.547 --> 09:09.631
well-respected member
of this community.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.675
His roots go way back.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.094
His grandfather, Joshua Palmer,

09:14.387 --> 09:17.430
brought the family here
more than 75 years ago.

09:17.640 --> 09:22.060
Your Honor, no one can know

09:22.937 --> 09:27.190
what it's like to lose a daughter
the way Leland did.

09:29.318 --> 09:30.610
That's all.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.488
Thank you, sheriff.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.408
Mr. Lodwick, would you care?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.202
I thought I might sell this
to the Gazette.

09:39.370 --> 09:42.497
They seem to like
courtroom sketches.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.587
Yeah, why don't you try
for a little more face than that?

09:48.796 --> 09:50.672
high standing in the community,

09:50.840 --> 09:53.508
and the pristine nature of his public...

09:53.676 --> 09:54.968
Just an idea.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.762
Good. Thanks, sheriff.

09:57.972 --> 10:02.100
The defendant is released
on his own recognizance.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.686
Now, Leland,

10:05.813 --> 10:10.400
as you know,
I will require you to remain in town

10:11.235 --> 10:14.821
and making your whereabouts
known to the sheriff

10:14.989 --> 10:16.865
on a regular basis.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.910
Sid, check the calendar,

10:21.078 --> 10:23.747
and we'll set a date
for Mr. Palmer's trial

10:24.332 --> 10:26.958
as soon as possible.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.143
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.563
Thank you.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.027
Oh, mm.

10:55.446 --> 10:59.699
So, what's behind those
deep blue eyes today?

10:59.867 --> 11:02.410
I've got a proposition for you.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.747
I'll share my life with you.
I'll tell it to you.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.166
Part of your living novel...

11:09.377 --> 11:12.212
...if you let me read Laura's diary.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.093
It's intriguing.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.600
I'll read it to you.

11:27.436 --> 11:30.480
But it mustn't physically
leave this room.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.858
Acceptable.

11:45.287 --> 11:49.374
- You'll start?
- Of course.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.043
A bargain has been struck.

12:27.788 --> 12:31.374
Donna Hayward.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.179
- Begin.
- All right.

12:44.388 --> 12:47.223
I'm from Twin Peaks.
Actually, I was born here.

12:47.767 --> 12:51.644
My father delivered me.
He's a doctor.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.523
Where are you from?

12:59.320 --> 13:01.321
I grew up in Boston.

13:01.947 --> 13:05.492
Well, actually, I grew up in books.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.876
There's things
you can't get in books.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.340
There are things
you can't get anywhere.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.303
But we dream
they can be found in other people.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.391
Continue.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.311
Maybe our dreams are real.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.778
My turn.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.823
What are you doing?

13:45.032 --> 13:48.493
Maybe I'll read it out here
on the lawn.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.454
Please.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.791
We've only just started.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.501
Why don't you come with me?

13:56.669 --> 13:59.337
Come on.
What's there to be afraid of?

13:59.964 --> 14:01.464
Come on.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.469
Please?

14:07.972 --> 14:09.931
Give that back to me.

14:16.939 --> 14:22.235
Harold?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.488
I'm sorry.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.327
I'm sorry.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.754
The defense will continue
with its evidence.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.548
If you would, Mr. Racine.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.342
You can see from these EEGs,

14:46.510 --> 14:48.928
this chart here,
which is actually of my own head,

14:49.138 --> 14:51.931
is intended to show
normal brain activity.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.517
Objection to the use
of the word "normal," Your Honor.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.269
Well, he's close enough.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.855
Objection overruled.

15:00.316 --> 15:06.905
This chart here is of Mr. Johnson
and shows minimal activity.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.162
A previously submitted
medical report

15:14.330 --> 15:18.625
states that Mr. Johnson
has suffered diffuse brain damage.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.544
He doesn't currently
even have the perspicacity

15:21.712 --> 15:24.547
to take the standard CST
competency test.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.759
We therefore submit

15:28.969 --> 15:31.346
that trying this individual

15:32.139 --> 15:34.599
would constitute a mockery
of the justice system.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.477
A proceeding that
the unfortunate young man

15:37.645 --> 15:40.355
would not even faintly comprehend.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.111
Mr. Prosecutor.

15:50.532 --> 15:53.451
I know Leo Johnson
isn't in very good shape.

15:53.661 --> 15:57.455
On the surface, it might seem
ridiculous to make him stand trial.

15:57.623 --> 16:01.501
But the trial does more
than just punish the wrongdoer.

16:01.669 --> 16:06.005
It also brings a feeling of justice
and retribution to a community.

16:06.173 --> 16:09.384
Among the various crimes
Leo Johnson is suspected of,

16:09.593 --> 16:15.181
the murder of Laura Palmer is the sort
that can wound an entire town.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.976
As long as Leo Johnson
carries a breath,

16:18.143 --> 16:20.645
- All right.
- he is as eminently deserving of a trial

16:20.813 --> 16:23.356
as this community is
of a sense of resolution!

16:23.524 --> 16:25.400
All right.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.695
Now, have a seat, Mr. Lodwick.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.326
Now, you fellas
can catch your breath.

16:36.286 --> 16:39.747
I, uh, am going to need to deliberate.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.293
Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman,

16:44.461 --> 16:47.171
if I could have the pleasure
of your company.

16:49.508 --> 16:53.594
Sid, can you fix us up with three
black Yukon sucker punches?

16:53.804 --> 16:55.555
Yes, Your Honor.

16:55.764 --> 17:00.643
Lodwick really planted his feet
and looked it in the eye.

17:00.811 --> 17:04.772
I didn't expect him to press
on the murder charge.

17:04.940 --> 17:08.317
Cooper, is Leo Johnson our man?

17:08.485 --> 17:10.737
No, sir. I don't believe he is.

17:10.904 --> 17:14.949
Harry, what's the temperature
of the town?

17:15.117 --> 17:18.327
Do they want a trial or a lynching?

17:18.495 --> 17:21.414
They want the right man
brought to justice.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.958
Well, they don't need a circus.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.544
And this poor bastard,

17:26.712 --> 17:28.963
he seems to be a heady cabbage.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.299
Thoughts, Cooper?

17:31.467 --> 17:35.011
I feel the killer
will eventually be apprehended.

17:36.346 --> 17:40.808
You have to watch these.
They sneak up on you.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.908
I'm gonna declare Leo Johnson

17:57.076 --> 18:00.369
to be not competent to stand trial.

18:01.080 --> 18:05.124
And when medically possible,
that he be shipped home.

18:08.170 --> 18:12.423
Harry, uh, do you wanna tell
the little lady yourself?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.259
Thanks, Clinton.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.558
- Cooper, how long you been here?
- Twelve days, sir.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.353
- They're not gonna try him.
- No?

18:25.771 --> 18:28.106
Leo is coming home.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.235
I'll advise you to keep your eye
on the woods.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.489
The woods are wondrous here...

18:37.616 --> 18:39.784
...but strange.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.036
Thanks.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.974
Can I get you anything, Nadine?

19:04.309 --> 19:07.770
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

19:10.190 --> 19:14.235
- You go to the high school.
- Well, yeah.

19:14.403 --> 19:19.115
Heh. Yeah, it took me a second.
You're not in any of my classes.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.784
Why don't you sit down, honey?
Let me get you a drink.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.828
Oh, no, I'll get it.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.374
Where are Mom and Dad?

19:28.917 --> 19:31.961
Oh, uh, out of town.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.421
Oh.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.548
Okay.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.468
You're a jack and I'm a jack
And Steeplejacks are we

19:39.636 --> 19:41.220
Wow.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.807
Doc Hayward said
to roll with the punches.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.061
Have you thought about maybe
taking her to see Dr. Jacoby?

19:49.271 --> 19:52.231
No, he's in Hawaii
recovering from that heart attack.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.866
It just came right off.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.218
Mr. Tojamura is here.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.470
Mister who?

20:27.809 --> 20:29.894
Excuse me. Uh...

20:30.729 --> 20:34.315
- Do you have an appointment, Mr?
- Tojamura.

20:35.067 --> 20:39.987
I represent Asian investment bank.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.366
We have superior offer

20:43.533 --> 20:47.870
for Ghostwood Project.

20:48.580 --> 20:54.210
I have commitment letters
from Tokyo banks

20:54.378 --> 20:56.379
prepared to move immediately.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.215
This all sounds very interesting,

20:59.383 --> 21:03.427
but unfortunately, I have an important
conference call in a couple of minutes.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.304
I have prospectus...

21:06.139 --> 21:10.810
- Perhaps some other time.
...and taste.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.277
Five.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.823
Million? Ah.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.181
Leave these.
Let my people have a look at them.

21:49.349 --> 21:50.683
Point of visit.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.368
Cooper's on his way.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.249
Your call from Canada, Mr. Horne.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.044
- Is that our call?
- Yes.

22:18.211 --> 22:20.504
You pushed it pretty close.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.346
Benjamin Horne.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.264
Are you ready to play?

22:30.849 --> 22:32.141
Audrey.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.562
- I wanna talk to my daughter.
- That can wait for tonight.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.106
One time. Across the border,

22:39.274 --> 22:42.735
five miles east of Grand Forks,
on the road to Castlegar,

22:42.903 --> 22:45.446
is a bar called the Columbian.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.282
Behind it
is a failed amusement park.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.368
Go to the merry-go-round.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.746
Leave the briefcase
beside the horse with no head,

22:53.914 --> 22:56.665
at midnight, alone.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.876
I'll be sending my representative.

23:08.053 --> 23:12.932
Serialized denominations,
as you instructed.

23:15.143 --> 23:19.188
My daughter's life is in your hands.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.783
Stay by a phone.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.168
Follow him.

23:41.336 --> 23:44.922
Make sure that he and the money
are neatly delivered.

23:45.090 --> 23:49.301
- Bring Audrey back.
- Cooper's not bringing her back?

23:50.387 --> 23:52.555
Cooper isn't coming back.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.682
If you can manage it,

23:54.850 --> 23:58.811
bring back Audrey
and the briefcase.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.655
Five million dollars.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.783
Now, that's a good day's work.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.586
All right,
once you're in Harold's apartment,

24:23.753 --> 24:25.129
move as fast as you can.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.131
This is scary.

24:27.299 --> 24:31.177
Laura's diary is in a secret shelf
at the very bottom of the bookcase,

24:31.386 --> 24:33.304
behind a row of fake books.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.891
Now, I think that there's a doohickey
on the right-hand side

24:37.058 --> 24:40.686
that somehow lets the shelf
slide out and down.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.189
All the notebooks look the same,
except for Laura's.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.691
Hers is smaller with a red cover.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.902
How are you gonna get him
to go outside?

24:48.069 --> 24:49.653
Not outside,
just out of the front room.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.406
Then I'll signal you with the flashlight
through the window.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.366
The door will be open.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.786
I thought you liked this guy.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.332
I do.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.759
Okay.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.179
Cooper hands me the briefcase.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.639
I take it...

25:23.313 --> 25:25.064
What about Ben Horne?

25:25.232 --> 25:28.567
Well, he give up control
of One-Eyed Jack's.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.444
It's yours.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.988
With his daughter dead?

25:33.907 --> 25:36.325
You know, you love a good steak

25:36.493 --> 25:39.620
but you don't want to know
how it got on your plate.

25:39.788 --> 25:43.624
You must be serious about
your business, Blackie.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.668
How are you gonna do the girl?

25:48.463 --> 25:50.172
Voilà.

26:01.977 --> 26:06.230
- Does the girl sleep?
- Dreamland.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.860
Come, come, come. Come to me.

26:14.906 --> 26:19.285
In the other room,
the girl dreams of fishes

26:19.452 --> 26:22.288
and dark lakebeds
and tangle weeds.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.040
What about Blackie?

26:25.625 --> 26:29.128
- I've waited long enough.
- We have our fun tonight.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.215
Whoo.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.135
Kiss me.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.891
Right. Okay. Bye.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.904
Laboratory Services.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.032
Yeah,
I'm calling for some test results.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.367
Doc Hayward said
I could just call you up and...

27:00.535 --> 27:03.454
- Yes, what test was it for, sir?
- What's it for?

27:03.622 --> 27:04.913
Yes, please, sir.

27:05.081 --> 27:11.879
It was for a semen's analysis.
Brennan, Andy.

27:12.047 --> 27:16.592
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you, sir.
- Sorry. Brennan, Andy.

27:16.760 --> 27:20.512
Oh, the doctor's analysis
is oligospermia, sir.

27:20.680 --> 27:24.266
Yes, could you go slower.
I wanna write all this down.

27:24.434 --> 27:30.689
- Oligospermia.
- "Oligospermia."

27:30.857 --> 27:33.817
- That's right.
- That sounds terrible.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.612
- I have that?
- No, sir. You had that.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.864
Oh, I had it.

27:39.032 --> 27:44.787
- It means too few sperms.
- "Too few sperms."

27:44.954 --> 27:46.914
Very good, sir.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.666
You mean I'm cured?

27:48.833 --> 27:51.001
Uh, the doctor says
they're not just three men on a...

27:51.169 --> 27:55.839
"Doc says they're not just
three men on a fishing trip,

27:56.007 --> 27:58.425
- They're a whole damn town.
- they're a whole damn town."

27:58.593 --> 28:01.637
- That's right, sir. Do you understand?
- Yeah, I know what it means.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.806
It means they're not really real
people, they're...

28:03.973 --> 28:07.267
- I'm sorry, sir, I've got another call.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

28:07.435 --> 28:10.062
- You're welcome, sir.
- Thank you very much.

28:11.314 --> 28:14.400
I'm a whole damn town!

28:15.485 --> 28:18.278
I'm a whole damn town.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.573
Whoo!

28:24.369 --> 28:26.036
Don't ask.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.747
Where were we?

28:28.915 --> 28:32.042
Okay, main bar
and greeting room here.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.128
Casino and get-acquainted room.

28:34.713 --> 28:38.966
- What's this, Blackie's office?
- We'll find out when we get there.

28:42.679 --> 28:46.348
The one-armed man is staying in
the Robin's Nest Motel on Highway 9.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.476
Nobody's seen him for at least
a day, a day and a half.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.271
The room looks lived-in.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.523
I found this.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.067
Same drug as last time.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.153
A weird, deep smell.

29:00.613 --> 29:03.574
We're still waiting on Albert's analysis.
Good work, Hawk.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.078
Hawk, see you in the morning.

29:21.676 --> 29:23.177
Okay.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.346
We'll approach through the woods
to the rear door.

29:26.514 --> 29:29.850
Inside are stairs leading down
to the working rooms.

29:30.435 --> 29:33.103
My guess is,
that's where Audrey's being held.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.523
What kind of muscle do they have?

29:36.691 --> 29:40.652
A couple of floor men in the casino,
probably more in the back.

29:42.071 --> 29:43.906
Let's go get her.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.332
- Good night, Andy.
- See you in the morning, Andy.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.209
Good work.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.510
"Gwen and Larry."

30:12.977 --> 30:14.603
Adam's Abortion Clinic.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.188
Hi, is Lucy...? What?

30:16.356 --> 30:18.565
Adam's Abortion Clinic.

30:21.402 --> 30:24.321
Oh, my God.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.499
Can I get a cup of coffee to go?

30:35.667 --> 30:38.836
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.963
Large, please.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.925
- So you seen Donna today?
- No, sorry.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.844
- You?
- No.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.930
- So, what's with the coffee?
- Coffee?

30:50.098 --> 30:52.516
It's for Uncle Leland.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.394
You don't have coffee at home?

30:56.396 --> 30:59.398
James, I can't talk now.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.067
- I need to go.
- You need to go?

31:02.235 --> 31:05.612
- Where are you going?
- Home. Bye, James.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.519
Donna Hayward.

31:37.854 --> 31:43.942
March 7th, Tuesday.
Second session.

31:45.361 --> 31:47.237
Dear diary...

31:49.782 --> 31:51.783
Uh, this is from a long time ago.
Is that okay?

31:54.412 --> 32:00.584
I was about 13 years old, 14 maybe.

32:02.170 --> 32:07.674
Me and Laura put on our tightest,
shortest skirts. Too tight.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.635
But Laura talked me into it.

32:13.139 --> 32:16.350
We were going to the Roadhouse
to meet boys.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.645
Their names are

32:20.647 --> 32:26.068
Josh, Rick and Tim.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.198
They're about 20 years old.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.953
And they're nice to us.

32:48.007 --> 32:49.925
And they make us feel
like we're older.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.099
Rick asks if we wanna go party.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.726
And Laura says, yes.

33:00.395 --> 33:05.190
And all of a sudden, I feel this knot
building up in my stomach.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.736
But when Laura gets in the truck
with Rick, I go anyway.

33:11.572 --> 33:13.907
Stream in the woods.

33:15.368 --> 33:16.702
Full moon, I think.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.538
It's pale and light out.

33:23.584 --> 33:27.254
Laura starts to dance
around the boys.

33:32.301 --> 33:35.137
She begins to move her hips...

33:35.805 --> 33:40.267
...back and forth.

33:43.438 --> 33:48.150
Rick starts to clap, but Tim doesn't
do anything, he just watches.

33:50.153 --> 33:52.612
Somehow, that makes me angry.

33:53.614 --> 33:56.408
So I say, "Let's go skinny-dipping."

34:01.789 --> 34:04.249
We take off our clothes.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.336
I know the boys are watching.

34:09.130 --> 34:12.090
Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.551
I don't know what to do.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.138
So I swim away.

34:21.434 --> 34:24.186
I feel like I wanna run, but I don't.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.983
Tim swims out to me.

34:33.279 --> 34:35.489
He kisses my hand...

34:37.742 --> 34:39.534
...and then me.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.503
I can still feel that kiss.

34:52.006 --> 34:56.093
His lips are warm and sweet.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.098
My heart jumps.

35:03.184 --> 35:06.061
He's talking to me,
but I can't hear him.

35:08.731 --> 35:10.899
Only the kiss.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.363
I never saw him again.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.617
It was the first time I ever fell in love.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.836
That's all.

35:31.045 --> 35:33.380
That was beautiful, Donna.

36:10.626 --> 36:12.252
I got him.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.322
Harry.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.651
Wait here, Harry.

38:04.907 --> 38:06.825
No. Dead end.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.636
- Two.
- Audrey?

38:39.775 --> 38:43.111
Not such a bad way to go,
all things considered.

38:43.279 --> 38:46.072
No, no. It's beautiful.

38:46.282 --> 38:50.201
- Is she alone?
- Nancy's with her.

38:50.911 --> 38:54.122
What does she do for you I can't?

38:54.540 --> 38:57.834
Well, something new.

39:15.561 --> 39:20.023
Most people imagine orchids
growing in exotic, steamy places.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.691
But you can grow them anywhere.

39:21.984 --> 39:24.944
It's all basically a matter
of water and light, isn't it?

39:26.113 --> 39:27.989
It's beautiful.

39:28.657 --> 39:30.575
Here, look.

39:33.496 --> 39:38.291
See, humidity is paramount.
Well, the control of it, I mean.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.961
Too much moisture
is an invitation to disease.

39:42.463 --> 39:45.423
Three sepals and three petals.

39:45.591 --> 39:49.135
The bottom petal,
shaped like a lower lip,

39:49.303 --> 39:51.554
is called a labellum.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.265
So delicate.

39:56.394 --> 40:02.232
Well, it's the landing platform,
really, for pollinating insects.

40:02.858 --> 40:05.151
Romantic, isn't it?

40:37.435 --> 40:39.978
Will you excuse me a minute?

41:15.181 --> 41:16.639
Hi.

41:17.057 --> 41:20.477
Would you take me
to Audrey Horne, please?

41:20.728 --> 41:24.355
- I don't think she's available.
- Let's double-check.

41:44.043 --> 41:47.295
It's not my idea, okay?

41:47.838 --> 41:50.215
You're nothing but meat on a hook
to these people.

41:50.382 --> 41:51.966
Shut up.

41:53.677 --> 41:55.553
Audrey, can you hear me?

41:55.721 --> 41:57.972
Mm... Who...?

42:06.941 --> 42:08.233
My prayers.

42:08.776 --> 42:12.153
Audrey, I'm gonna take you
out of here now.

42:33.133 --> 42:34.926
No.

42:35.094 --> 42:39.180
When you leave me with a kiss.

42:39.765 --> 42:43.560
That's the way you want it,
that's fine.

43:25.769 --> 43:27.520
Drop the gun.

43:28.814 --> 43:30.523
Slowly.

43:33.444 --> 43:37.030
Now, turn around.

43:53.922 --> 43:56.132
Good thing you guys
can't keep a secret.

44:00.095 --> 44:01.804
Good throw.

44:11.607 --> 44:13.358
There's been gunfire.

44:13.525 --> 44:16.319
Truman and Cooper are leaving
with your daughter.

44:17.571 --> 44:22.575
Now, who can this be?

44:23.869 --> 44:26.871
Monsieur Lodwick. DA's office, eh?

44:43.931 --> 44:46.099
- Is something wrong?
- No.

44:46.266 --> 44:47.975
You just frightened me, that's all.

44:54.650 --> 44:56.943
Uh, come here.

44:57.152 --> 44:59.070
Tell me about this orchid. This one.

45:17.047 --> 45:18.506
Harold, no, you don't understand.

45:24.138 --> 45:25.763
Maddy!

45:28.183 --> 45:29.767
Wait!

45:34.273 --> 45:36.023
Are you looking for secrets?

45:38.360 --> 45:40.820
Is that what all this is about?

45:43.073 --> 45:45.324
Well, maybe I can help you.

45:47.369 --> 45:50.580
Do you know
what the ultimate secret is?

45:50.789 --> 45:52.582
You want to know?

45:53.459 --> 45:55.251
Laura did.

46:00.549 --> 46:03.843
The secret of knowing who killed you.
