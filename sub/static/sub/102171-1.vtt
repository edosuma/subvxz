00:17.827 --> 00:19.461
<i>Okay, thank you very much.</i>

00:23.198 --> 00:25.802
We're in a very critical
phase of our war

00:25.835 --> 00:28.170
against the coronavirus.

00:28.203 --> 00:32.675
<i>Our country is in the midst
of a great national trial,</i>

00:32.709 --> 00:35.712
<i>unlike any we have
ever faced before.</i>

00:35.745 --> 00:37.379
<i>As people
isolate at home,</i>

00:37.412 --> 00:39.749
<i>video conferencing
is the new normal.</i>

00:39.782 --> 00:41.718
<i>The
video meeting app,</i>

00:41.751 --> 00:43.653
<i>increasingly popular in the
era of social distancing.</i>

00:43.686 --> 00:45.755
<i>An app that
experts warned could be used</i>

00:45.788 --> 00:48.725
<i>by governments to eavesdrop
on their citizens.</i>

00:48.758 --> 00:50.893
<i>After consistently
downplaying the virus,</i>

00:50.927 --> 00:54.463
<i>President Trump tested positive
for COVID-19 last night.</i>

00:54.496 --> 00:56.398
<i>Today he boarded Marine One,</i>

00:56.431 --> 00:58.668
<i>heading to Walter Reed
Medical Center for treatment.</i>

00:58.701 --> 01:00.703
<i>What you're
seeing are massive groups</i>

01:00.737 --> 01:02.839
<i>ignoring the curfews,
crowding the streets.</i>

01:02.872 --> 01:04.607
<i>Just months
after what we thought</i>

01:04.641 --> 01:07.175
<i>was the end of COVID,
this is a momentous day</i>

01:07.209 --> 01:09.211
<i>in the relentless
march of this pandemic.</i>

01:09.244 --> 01:11.648
<i>The new strain is
three times more contagious</i>

01:11.681 --> 01:13.415
<i>and it has twice
the mortality rate.</i>

01:13.448 --> 01:15.350
<i>As of
tonight, over 18 months</i>

01:15.384 --> 01:17.352
<i>into a seemingly
endless struggle,</i>

01:17.386 --> 01:20.322
<i>the U.S. count alone is more
than 1 million people dead.</i>

01:20.355 --> 01:22.457
<i>This footage at
the White House barricade,</i>

01:22.491 --> 01:25.460
<i>moments before the police
and protesters clashed.</i>

01:25.494 --> 01:26.929
<i>As fires
continue to spread,</i>

01:26.963 --> 01:29.364
<i>the air quality in many
U.S. cities declines</i>

01:29.398 --> 01:31.333
<i>to evermore dangerous levels.</i>

01:31.366 --> 01:33.603
<i>The increasing
tension resulting in greater</i>

01:33.636 --> 01:34.804
<i>and greater violence.</i>

01:34.837 --> 01:37.239
<i>January 13, 2022,</i>

01:37.272 --> 01:40.208
<i>the death toll now
at 12.3 million,</i>

01:40.242 --> 01:42.879
<i>as the second strain of the
virus continues to spread.</i>

01:42.912 --> 01:45.547
We ask you to follow
the guidelines

01:45.581 --> 01:48.685
of no groups coming
together of more than 10,

01:48.718 --> 01:50.853
and if anyone in the
household is sick,

01:50.887 --> 01:54.590
that everyone quarantines
in the household together.

01:54.624 --> 01:56.726
<i>The third major
strain of the coronavirus</i>

01:56.759 --> 02:00.262
<i>has brought the total to 31.2
million American lives lost.</i>

02:00.295 --> 02:03.432
<i>To bring back order and slow
the spread of the disease,</i>

02:03.465 --> 02:05.300
<i>increasing penalties
have been set</i>

02:05.333 --> 02:07.804
<i>for those breaking the
strict nationwide curfews.</i>

02:14.577 --> 02:16.946
<i>Sooner or later,
the pandemic has to end.</i>

02:16.979 --> 02:19.414
<i>It's not a crisis
like a hurricane or 911,</i>

02:19.448 --> 02:21.784
<i>where it's bound by time and geography.
It feels indefinite.</i>

02:21.818 --> 02:23.820
<i>It takes a toll on people
in a very real way,</i>

02:23.853 --> 02:26.689
<i>to be stuck inside, unable to
do the things they wanna do</i>

02:26.723 --> 02:28.725
<i>or go places they're used to.</i>

02:28.758 --> 02:30.793
<i>Dr. Lauren Fisker is

02:30.827 --> 02:33.562
<i>In Los Angeles, California,
newly appointed police chief,</i>

02:33.596 --> 02:35.865
<i>Charles Yates, mandated a new
earlier curfew this month,</i>

02:35.898 --> 02:37.934
<i>citing worsening
numbers in the city.</i>

02:37.967 --> 02:40.603
<i>Anyone caught outside
their designated neighborhoods</i>

02:40.636 --> 02:44.473
<i>past curfew, without specific
credentials, will be arrested</i>

02:44.506 --> 02:46.441
<i>and held in a detention center.</i>

02:50.713 --> 02:53.448
Harper, hey, girl.

02:53.482 --> 02:55.752
Holy shit, that picture
you started was crazy.

02:55.785 --> 02:57.319
What happened to the
Salt Lake barbecue?

02:57.352 --> 03:01.356
Oh my God, the whole
block burned down.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.059
- Wow.
- Yeah,

03:03.092 --> 03:04.694
it's my late night go to.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.863
RIP.

03:06.896 --> 03:09.899
Austin's turning into
a fucking ghost town.

03:09.932 --> 03:13.401
Yeah.
What city isn't, right?

03:13.435 --> 03:17.907
Yeah, so where's Evan?

03:17.940 --> 03:20.610
Why did you wanna
get me on early?

03:20.643 --> 03:23.813
- I have some news.
- Did he propose?

03:25.114 --> 03:26.348
No.

03:26.381 --> 03:28.416
So what happened?

03:28.450 --> 03:33.321
Alright, but you have to promise
not to tell anyone, especially Evan.

03:33.355 --> 03:35.024
I may have known him
longer, but, girl,

03:35.057 --> 03:38.060
you know I would take you
any day in the divorce.

03:38.094 --> 03:44.399
Yes, okay...
I'm pregnant.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.468
- You're pregnant?
- Shh.

03:46.501 --> 03:48.104
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

03:48.137 --> 03:51.874
Wait, okay, so
Evan doesn't know?

03:51.908 --> 03:54.644
No, I'm gonna tell
him after the party,

03:54.677 --> 03:55.978
but I didn't want
him to stress out,

03:56.012 --> 03:58.480
but I had to get it out.

03:58.513 --> 04:01.984
Oh my God, I'm so
happy for you guys.

04:03.552 --> 04:05.453
Oh, shit, okay,
he's coming, just...

04:06.722 --> 04:08.758
Okay, yeah, I'll snooze you.

04:09.725 --> 04:12.128
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hello.

04:12.161 --> 04:13.796
And my phone is dead.

04:22.171 --> 04:23.840
- You want anything?
- Nope.

04:23.873 --> 04:25.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:25.741 --> 04:28.510
Hey, oh, I miss those faces.

04:28.543 --> 04:31.446
- Hey, girl.
- Oh, you forgot the wine.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.982
- One sec.
- Hold on.

04:33.883 --> 04:35.517
Aw, they look good, huh?

04:38.621 --> 04:40.790
Yes, there we go.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.158
- Hey, careful.
- I'm sorry.

04:42.191 --> 04:44.093
Oh, yeah, how are
you two holding up?

04:44.126 --> 04:46.696
- Oh, God, the same.
- The exact same.

04:46.729 --> 04:50.600
Oh, except Central Park is now
a giant makeshift hospital,

04:50.633 --> 04:52.068
so that's great.

04:52.101 --> 04:55.071
Anyway ,
happy birthday, Evan.

04:55.104 --> 04:57.472
Oh my God, how excited are you?

04:57.505 --> 04:58.608
- Yes.
- Another birthday.

04:59.574 --> 05:02.178
- Oh.
- Hey, Harper.

05:02.211 --> 05:03.779
Austin to the TX, what's up?

05:03.813 --> 05:05.615
- No, take your time.
- Yeah, we can wait.

05:05.648 --> 05:07.617
It's fine, we have
nothing to do.

05:08.651 --> 05:10.552
Oh.

05:10.586 --> 05:12.989
How are you guys doing?

05:13.022 --> 05:14.090
I'm kidding.

05:14.123 --> 05:15.691
You know I know how you are.

05:15.725 --> 05:18.127
We gettin' white girl wasted
up in here.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.494
I don't know what this is.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.596
- I can do that.
- You guys,

05:21.964 --> 05:23.199
look what I found.

05:23.232 --> 05:25.201
- Oh my God.
- Oh, man.

05:25.234 --> 05:26.669
Where...

05:26.702 --> 05:28.604
Oh my God,
where did you find it?

05:28.638 --> 05:30.106
Where'd you dig that up?

05:30.139 --> 05:31.573
I literally organized
and cleaned everything.

05:31.607 --> 05:32.942
- High school.
- Evan, look at your hair.

05:32.975 --> 05:34.542
- I know, high school.
- He was a baby.

05:34.577 --> 05:35.912
Wow, I didn't have
any good role models.

05:35.945 --> 05:37.179
Yeah, he definitely
went through one

05:37.213 --> 05:38.781
or two phases with the hair.

05:38.814 --> 05:40.616
Harper, can you send me
a copy of that,

05:40.650 --> 05:42.517
and maybe send one to
everyone else in the group?

05:42.550 --> 05:44.086
Oh, yeah, not a problem.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.855
You know that's coming.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.791
Oh, first, you guys,
what is up with these things?

05:48.824 --> 05:50.458
- Yeah, what is this?
- I don't know.

05:50.492 --> 05:51.627
- What is hers?
- Oh, no idea.

05:51.661 --> 05:52.728
- No clue.
- I don't know.

05:52.762 --> 05:54.597
Ah, Mia, Mia, hi.

05:54.630 --> 05:55.998
Where's Oliver?
We want to open these.

05:56.032 --> 05:57.600
- What's going on?
- Yeah, what is happening?

05:57.633 --> 05:58.935
I honestly don't know.
This is his thing.

05:58.968 --> 06:00.568
Bitches, no,
don't start without me.

06:00.603 --> 06:02.972
- Oh my God.
- Are you okay?

06:03.005 --> 06:04.140
You start without me?

06:04.173 --> 06:05.942
- Jesus.
- No, okay.

06:05.975 --> 06:07.677
- Happy birthday, Evan.
- Happy birthday, Evan.

06:07.710 --> 06:11.047
And a one, and a two,
and a one, two, three.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.050

- That's very good.

06:24.093 --> 06:25.594
- I thought that was good.
- Yeah, that was touching.

06:25.628 --> 06:27.964
You all should do a live concert

06:27.997 --> 06:29.865
and relieve yourselves
from that.

06:31.834 --> 06:35.738
In other birthday news, Jen made
us our very last freezer rib eyes.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.974
- Fancy.
- Then she came to our room

06:38.007 --> 06:39.574
wearing nothing but
my varsity jersey.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.110
What the fuck?

06:41.143 --> 06:42.712
No, no, no, no, no, okay,
all right, that's cool.

06:42.745 --> 06:44.647
And then we watched
his favorite movie.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.948
- <i>Point Break.</i>
- Yes.

06:45.982 --> 06:47.717
Fire.

06:47.750 --> 06:50.518
- Sick.
- Straight movie.

06:50.552 --> 06:52.288
- Come on, guys.
- It was a very special day.

06:52.321 --> 06:53.856
- I loved it.
- Good.

06:53.889 --> 06:55.291
Right up until Antonio
saw us grilling

06:55.324 --> 06:58.060
and guilted us into
going back inside.

06:58.094 --> 07:00.062
Dude, that guy's such a dick.

07:00.096 --> 07:02.765
- Wait, who is Antonio?
- He's their neighbor and an ex-cop.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.633
Yeah, and he's been
so bored, that lately,

07:04.667 --> 07:06.068
he just reports
every little thing

07:06.102 --> 07:07.703
that's slightly out of place.

07:07.737 --> 07:09.605
All right, Ollie,
I can't wait anymore.

07:09.638 --> 07:10.639
- What is going on?
- Yeah.

07:10.673 --> 07:12.775
- Yeah.
- Okay,

07:12.808 --> 07:17.013
so obviously Vegas
couldn't happen again.

07:17.046 --> 07:19.315
- Will it ever happen?
- Well, stay tuned,

07:19.348 --> 07:21.951
my friends, 'cause that's
what we're doing here today.

07:21.984 --> 07:24.687
We're taking the Vegas party
that you all thought was dead,

07:24.720 --> 07:26.589
and we're bringing it
right here, right now,

07:26.622 --> 07:28.958
because it is very much alive.

07:30.626 --> 07:33.029
- What is that face?
- Nah, you'll see.

07:34.296 --> 07:37.166
Okay, and open them.

07:37.199 --> 07:38.968
- Open them.
- All right, all right, all right.

07:42.338 --> 07:45.007
- Oh, they're so cute.
- What is this?

07:45.041 --> 07:46.242
- Really?
- Oh.

07:48.377 --> 07:50.613
- Oh.
- Have these been sterilized?

07:50.646 --> 07:52.248
Oh, come on,

07:52.281 --> 07:53.582
I thought it was gonna be
something better than this.

07:53.616 --> 07:57.019
Keep digging.

07:57.053 --> 07:58.187
Oh.

08:00.923 --> 08:02.557
Oh,

08:05.261 --> 08:08.030
so drugs?

08:08.064 --> 08:10.900
- Oh, this is so cute.
- Wait, what is this?

08:10.933 --> 08:12.601
Like molly or something?

08:12.635 --> 08:14.236
You're goddamn right it's molly.

08:14.270 --> 08:16.372
One for each one of you to
stick into those gorgeous faces.

08:16.405 --> 08:18.140
Got it from my guy
in the valley,

08:18.174 --> 08:20.609
but he got it shipped in
from Japan.

08:20.643 --> 08:22.278
But do they put those little
hearts on them over there?

08:22.311 --> 08:24.013
Yes, they do.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.681
This is designer shit.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.216
It's impossible to get anywhere,
especially now.

08:27.249 --> 08:28.751
Look at that.

08:29.985 --> 08:32.588
- We're in.
- We're in.

08:35.724 --> 08:36.692
What's up, Ben?

08:38.427 --> 08:42.731
Well, Mia,
you're cool with this?

08:42.765 --> 08:43.799
Why wouldn't I be?

08:43.833 --> 08:45.201
We're all a team now, right?

08:48.137 --> 08:49.805
Can we talk?

08:49.839 --> 08:51.273
Wait, either we all do this
or none of us do.

08:51.307 --> 08:53.375
- We expand our minds together.
- Yeah.

08:53.409 --> 08:54.877
Very well put, professor.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.145
No, no, no, come on,
I can bow out.

08:56.178 --> 08:58.647
You guys can still take them.

08:58.681 --> 09:02.051
- You could bow out, by the way.
- Come on, don't start, baby.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.619
I'm just saying.

09:09.125 --> 09:11.961
Okay, guys,
I guess we have to pass.

09:11.994 --> 09:13.395
- Thank you, though.
- What, what the fuck?

09:13.429 --> 09:14.430
- No.
- Come on.

09:14.463 --> 09:15.831
Come on.

09:15.865 --> 09:18.033
- Ben.
- Ben.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.935
Stop, no, you guys
don't understand how hard it was

09:19.969 --> 09:21.370
for me and my partner
during this whole thing.

09:21.403 --> 09:23.272
- Please, Ben.
- I can't.

09:23.305 --> 09:25.674
There's no interacting
with colleagues in real life.

09:25.708 --> 09:27.343
There hasn't been any
interacting with colleagues

09:27.376 --> 09:29.879
in real life in forever,
and that's exactly how long

09:29.912 --> 09:32.281
there hasn't been any
drug tests, so you're fine.

09:32.314 --> 09:35.317
- Yeah.
- What is it?

09:35.351 --> 09:37.186
The thing that happened
between you two guys?

09:37.219 --> 09:39.355
- Ollie, Ollie.
- We all talk.

09:39.388 --> 09:40.890
Everyone knows.

09:41.724 --> 09:42.725
Yeah, we all talk.

09:44.226 --> 09:45.394
- They're my best friends.
- Yeah,

09:45.427 --> 09:47.129
- and it's not a big deal.
- Ben,

09:47.163 --> 09:48.864
personally I see
your side of it.

09:51.934 --> 09:54.970
Ben, Ben, tonight
is about forgetting.

09:55.004 --> 09:57.473
Well, I thought it
was about my birthday?

09:57.506 --> 09:59.074
Shut up, Evan.

09:59.108 --> 10:00.109
It's about forgetting
about all the shit

10:00.142 --> 10:02.011
that's out of our control.

10:02.044 --> 10:03.379
Don't you want to let go of
all of it, just for one night,

10:03.412 --> 10:05.381
with no consequences?

10:05.414 --> 10:07.449
Yeah, be like Harper,
she eats that shit for breakfast.

10:07.483 --> 10:08.717
- Mm, maybe.
- Yeah, it's true

10:08.751 --> 10:10.386
and look at me.

10:10.419 --> 10:12.888
You're gonna make a
great nurse, Harper.

10:12.922 --> 10:13.956
Thank you.

10:15.491 --> 10:17.459
- Oh my.
- Please?

10:17.493 --> 10:18.894
- Okay, fine.
- Yay.

10:18.928 --> 10:19.962
- Yes.
- Yay.

10:22.765 --> 10:24.200
<i>♪ Open it up, open it up ♪</i>

10:24.233 --> 10:26.001
- All right.
- Y'all ready?

10:26.035 --> 10:27.803
- Yup.
- Yah.

10:27.836 --> 10:31.073
Okay, here we go, and a
three and a two and fuck it.

10:50.826 --> 10:55.164
Whoa, I feel like
I'm floating on air.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.498
- Oh my God.
- One with everything.

10:56.532 --> 10:58.067
Okay, all right, all right,

10:58.100 --> 10:59.235
obviously it's going
to take a second,

10:59.268 --> 11:01.003
ladies and gentlemen and Keanu.

11:01.036 --> 11:04.273
Okay, and now, welcome to Vegas.

11:07.343 --> 11:12.314
I love it.

11:12.348 --> 11:14.316
You two had to
have planned this.

11:14.350 --> 11:16.185
- No, we didn't.
- No.

11:16.218 --> 11:19.355
Yo, Oliver, you and I are cut
from the same cloth, dude.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.357
Guys, after all this time,
we finally made it.

11:23.492 --> 11:28.430
All right, so what should
we do to kill time,

11:28.464 --> 11:30.466
AKA take Ben's mind away

11:30.499 --> 11:33.335
from his ever mounting
drug-addled regret?

11:33.369 --> 11:35.504
Well, I am going to go
get some more alcohol.

11:40.142 --> 11:41.410
That's classy.

11:48.117 --> 11:50.219
- Jeez.
- Ah, Harper, nurse's opinion.

11:50.252 --> 11:53.155
Will red wine prevent me
having a heart attack?

11:53.188 --> 11:54.990
I'm asking for a
friend, obviously.

11:55.024 --> 11:57.159
Well, yeah,
it's like science, right?

11:57.192 --> 12:00.496
So Ollie, did she move in?

12:02.264 --> 12:04.166
It's kind of fast.

12:04.199 --> 12:07.236
- We're co-quarantine.
- Is your divorce final?

12:07.269 --> 12:10.139
- Oh, kitty likes to scratch.
- What?

12:10.172 --> 12:11.440
I just wanna know.

12:11.473 --> 12:12.374
The legal stuff
is taking forever.

12:12.408 --> 12:14.343
Seriously though, is it?

12:14.376 --> 12:15.878
The legal stuff is taking
forever, which is understandable.

12:15.911 --> 12:17.546
I'm just glad
she's in a safe place.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.450
We really miss Rachel.

12:21.483 --> 12:22.619
Yeah, can we have
her back, please?

12:22.652 --> 12:24.119
There's no talking about Rachel.

12:24.153 --> 12:25.387
There's no talk about Rachel.

12:25.421 --> 12:27.089
Okay, okay, what was it,
what was it?

12:27.122 --> 12:29.325
- Her beautiful body?
- Or that long black hair?

12:29.358 --> 12:31.093
Yes, thank you for reminding me.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.294
She broke up with me,
and thanks for the support,

12:32.328 --> 12:34.029
by the way.
You never...

12:34.063 --> 12:35.397
- Hey, you.
- Hi, honey.

12:37.634 --> 12:39.068
Okay.

12:40.469 --> 12:46.141
All right, so let's
get this party started.

12:46.175 --> 12:50.012
- We brought Pictionary.
- Are you joking?

12:51.046 --> 12:52.114
- Really?
- No, no,

12:52.147 --> 12:53.882
Pictionary is fine.

12:53.916 --> 12:56.085
Yes, it's my favorite game
to play with my friends

12:56.118 --> 12:59.955
- on molly in Vegas.
- Oh, okay, you know what?

12:59.988 --> 13:03.258
- That's enough of that.
- Oh, come on.

13:03.292 --> 13:05.160
Come on, dude, it'll be fun.

13:05.194 --> 13:07.429
All right, all right,
let's do it.

13:07.463 --> 13:09.498
- Okay.
- Okay, who goes first?

13:09.531 --> 13:11.033
Obviously the birthday boy.

13:11.066 --> 13:12.635
Yeah, everyone get
markers and paper.

13:12.669 --> 13:15.404
Okay, and everybody
close your eyes,

13:15.437 --> 13:17.640
- except for Evan.
- Markers and paper.

13:17.674 --> 13:19.174
- You got it?
- Ready?

13:19.208 --> 13:20.242
- Okay.
- All right.

13:20.275 --> 13:21.611
- Got it.
- Evan.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.349
Okay, got it, got it, got it.

13:27.383 --> 13:30.285
- And...
- Open?

13:30.319 --> 13:31.954
Go, yeah, open, go.

13:35.692 --> 13:37.259
- Oh, house.
- Park?

13:37.292 --> 13:38.427
- Apartment?
- Fire Island beach cottage.

13:38.460 --> 13:39.428
You slut.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.998
- That's what it looks like.
- Person?

13:44.099 --> 13:46.001
- Penguin?
- Person.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.002
- Woman's work, housework. It's housework.
- Woman's work.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.437
It's Harper, it's Harper.

13:48.470 --> 13:50.005
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.641
Oh, I get it,
'cause she's all alone.

13:51.674 --> 13:54.410
- Oh, lonely Harper.
- Doh.

13:54.443 --> 13:56.478
- Okay, yeah, yeah.
- It is Harper.

13:56.512 --> 14:00.215
- I love you.
- You guys, that's fucking cold.

14:00.249 --> 14:02.050
- Whatever.
- It is cold in your house.

14:02.084 --> 14:03.252
That's not what was on the
card, for the record, okay?

14:06.422 --> 14:08.357
- How's Patrick?
- Wait, who's Patrick?

14:08.390 --> 14:10.359
- He's her old roommate.
- Patrick, yeah.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.595
He's hanging in.

14:12.629 --> 14:14.597
His dad got corona and passed,

14:14.631 --> 14:18.500
and so he went to go take care
of his mom a while ago now.

14:19.602 --> 14:21.103
Guess all we can do right now

14:21.136 --> 14:23.138
is be with the ones
we love, right?

14:23.172 --> 14:27.309
Yeah, he and his fiancé
had to cancel their wedding

14:27.342 --> 14:30.279
four times, and it
finally did them in.

14:30.312 --> 14:34.216
Now he's stuck in the
middle of nowhere, Kansas,

14:34.249 --> 14:35.718
if you can imagine?

14:35.752 --> 14:38.554
Not that it matters where
you are anymore, right?

14:38.588 --> 14:41.624
- And we fought all the time.
- Question?

14:41.658 --> 14:43.258
What's going on with the apps?

14:43.292 --> 14:45.494
Can we please live
vicariously through you?

14:45.527 --> 14:48.430
Well, okay, guys will
forever be in two camps,

14:48.464 --> 14:50.399
aggressive and horny
and desperate.

14:50.432 --> 14:53.068
- That's you.
- Or, you know what?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.704
They want to move right in

14:54.737 --> 14:56.405
because it sucks doing this
fucking quarantine alone.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.641
- That's me.
- Yeah.

14:58.675 --> 15:00.509
- Yeah.
- Well,

15:00.542 --> 15:02.177
I think it's always better
to meet someone in real life.

15:02.211 --> 15:04.146
Yeah, and how does that
even happen anymore?

15:04.179 --> 15:06.315
Ollie and I met on the street,
in front of my place.

15:06.348 --> 15:09.151
He walked by almost every night.

15:09.184 --> 15:12.020
It took me months to see
what was behind her mask.

15:12.054 --> 15:13.388
- Oh, God.
- Well,

15:13.422 --> 15:14.791
look on the bright side.

15:14.824 --> 15:16.593
At least you're not
stuck homeschooling kids

15:16.626 --> 15:20.028
or trapped in the same house
with the same face over

15:20.062 --> 15:21.563
and over and over.

15:21.598 --> 15:23.031
Yes, we started to despise
one another this week,

15:23.065 --> 15:24.399
just a little.

15:24.433 --> 15:26.134
These drugs are...

15:26.168 --> 15:27.569
- They're strong.
- He keeps trying

15:27.604 --> 15:28.771
- to get me to read.
- Yeah.

15:28.805 --> 15:30.305
- What is it?
- They're coming on fast.

15:30.339 --> 15:31.540
- <i>The Republic.</i>
- <i>The Republic.</i>

15:31.573 --> 15:32.574
- Ew.
- Ick on <i>The Republic?</i>

15:32.609 --> 15:33.676
Yes, ick on <i>The Republic.</i>

15:33.710 --> 15:34.644
I don't even know what it is.

15:34.677 --> 15:36.411
Plato, it's Plato.

15:36.445 --> 15:38.080
Yeah, thank you, it's only
the most important piece

15:38.113 --> 15:39.181
of literature that has
survived for 2000 years.

15:39.214 --> 15:40.650
Oh my God, stop it.

15:40.683 --> 15:41.751
- It's a...
- Yo, I love this song.

15:41.784 --> 15:43.318
- Oh, yeah.
- Turn it up.

15:43.352 --> 15:44.553
It's a Plato set.

15:44.587 --> 15:45.688
Music brings the
soul to the mind.

15:45.722 --> 15:47.222
I love this song too.

15:47.256 --> 15:48.423
- Light to the imagination.
- Hey, hey,

15:48.457 --> 15:50.627
- should we?
- Ah, yeah, dance battle?

15:50.660 --> 15:52.662
- You wanna go?
- Yeah, I think we should actually.

15:52.695 --> 15:55.430
- I think we fucking should.
- Oh my God.

bitches?

16:56.926 --> 17:00.262
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

17:00.295 --> 17:03.198
- You win.
- I won as usual.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.336
Well, I think we
can say we are done

17:07.369 --> 17:09.471
with the dance battles.

17:09.504 --> 17:13.141
- So now what?
- Oh, I have an idea.

17:13.175 --> 17:14.611
How about we play a game,

17:14.644 --> 17:17.346
where we point out all
of your insecurities?

17:17.379 --> 17:18.815
- Sorry.
- Or whatever.

17:18.848 --> 17:20.750
- The truth hurts, okay.
- By the way,

17:20.783 --> 17:22.585
are you guys feeling this,
'cause I'm...

17:22.619 --> 17:26.288
- Me, me, I am.
- Oh my God,

17:26.321 --> 17:28.390
- my heart is racing.
- Yes, mine too.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.424
Evan, you were right.

17:29.458 --> 17:30.660
This shit is strong.

17:30.693 --> 17:32.662
I feel like I can
run a marathon.

17:32.695 --> 17:36.933
- Oh my God.
- Okay, big guy, we get it.

17:36.966 --> 17:39.802
- Very, very impressed.
- Yeah, show off, my God.

17:39.836 --> 17:43.438
I do feel pretty fucking great.

17:43.472 --> 17:45.507
Hey, that's the spirit.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.810
- Look, we got him.
- Woo.

17:48.745 --> 17:49.779
I had you on here.

17:51.614 --> 17:54.483
- Put it down.
- Oh, come on.

17:54.516 --> 17:55.952
It's after midnight on a Friday.

17:55.985 --> 17:57.419
- What could be this urgent?
- Just ignore it.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.287
No, no, you know what?

17:59.321 --> 18:01.390
I'm going to tell my senior
partner to take this email.

18:01.423 --> 18:02.759
- He can shove it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

18:02.792 --> 18:05.394
- No, no, no.
- Don't, no, no, no.

18:05.427 --> 18:06.495
- Don't do that.
- It's not funny.

18:06.528 --> 18:07.730
- Give it.
- No, sorry.

18:07.764 --> 18:09.264
- Breathe, breathe.
- All right,

18:09.297 --> 18:10.365
definitely time
for another game.

18:10.399 --> 18:12.602
How about Fuck, Marry, Kill?

18:12.635 --> 18:15.905
- Whoa.
- Yes.

18:15.938 --> 18:18.407
That's like the worst game
you could possibly play

18:18.440 --> 18:20.208
- with a group of friends.
- Yeah, no way.

18:20.242 --> 18:22.344
Well, I would fuck Evan,
marry Oliver and kill this.

18:22.377 --> 18:23.746
Stop it.

18:23.780 --> 18:24.747
- I wasn't going to say you.
- Okay, okay,

18:24.781 --> 18:26.381
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:26.415 --> 18:30.252
How about Never Have I Ever?

18:30.285 --> 18:31.954
- I'm into that.
- Sure.

18:31.988 --> 18:34.991
Yeah, it's low stakes for
someone who's new to the group.

18:35.024 --> 18:38.260
Okay, well, we'll be best
friends in no time, don't worry.

18:40.295 --> 18:41.831
I'll start, yeah, yeah.

18:41.864 --> 18:43.966
Okay, three fingers,
and if you've done something,

18:44.000 --> 18:45.267
you have to put
your finger down.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.669
Yeah, we've played the game.

18:46.703 --> 18:47.569
Are you explaining
how to play this game?

18:47.603 --> 18:48.570
Never have I ever.

18:48.604 --> 18:49.972
Okay, so I'll go first.

18:50.006 --> 18:53.943
Never have I ever
had a one night stand.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.247
- Come on.
- Yeah, right.

18:59.281 --> 19:00.382
- Are you fucking...?
- No way.

19:00.415 --> 19:01.951
I'm not lying, I swear.

19:01.984 --> 19:05.755
Okay, okay, never have I
ever slept with two people

19:05.788 --> 19:06.989
in one day?

19:14.563 --> 19:16.599
- What can I say?
- What?

19:17.600 --> 19:19.534
- Oh, what?
- When?

19:19.568 --> 19:20.937
In high school.

19:20.970 --> 19:23.973
Was it like a morning
and a night thing?

19:24.006 --> 19:26.709
Like wake up with one,
go to sleep with another?

19:28.343 --> 19:29.879
- No.
- Oh,

19:29.912 --> 19:31.714
- so someone had a threesome.
- Jen.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.051
Hold on, wait.

19:35.084 --> 19:36.052
You never told me about this.

19:36.085 --> 19:37.954
What, it was so long ago.

19:37.987 --> 19:39.521
- So who were they?
- Yeah.

19:39.554 --> 19:42.058
- Ah, two guy friends.
- Two guys?

19:42.091 --> 19:44.359
What difference does it make?

19:44.392 --> 19:46.361
It's totally different.

19:47.597 --> 19:49.799
Oh, Evan, come on.

19:49.832 --> 19:52.367
- I wouldn't have thought.
- Yeah,

19:52.400 --> 19:55.437
this is why I don't
tell you things.

19:55.470 --> 19:58.007
Okay, I think we need to
change gears again, yeah?

19:58.040 --> 20:01.409
- Yeah, yes, please.
- Yeah, let's, let's, let's.

20:01.443 --> 20:03.311
Oh, I'm really feeling this.

20:08.985 --> 20:11.486
People right here,
we can see you.

20:14.624 --> 20:16.491
See, Rachel never
would have done this.

20:16.525 --> 20:18.426
- This is fucking...
- Jen, Jen, Jen.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.529
You're not on mute.

20:21.396 --> 20:22.999
- Oh.
- Well,

20:23.032 --> 20:25.067
good thing she isn't here
or you guys would miss out.

20:25.101 --> 20:28.004
Come here.

20:28.037 --> 20:31.473
- Sick.
- Two guys?

20:31.506 --> 20:34.409
- What, it was high school.
- Oh my God.

20:34.442 --> 20:35.845
Okay, you know what?

20:35.878 --> 20:37.780
You know what,
like you haven't had a past?

20:37.814 --> 20:40.448
I guess, but I want to be able
to share all of that with you.

20:40.482 --> 20:42.517
Oh, you want to be able
to share things with me?

20:42.551 --> 20:44.020
Okay, so you want to
share a threesome with me?

20:44.053 --> 20:47.389
All right, Harper, hey,
so are you busy later?

20:47.422 --> 20:48.390
You want to like hook up with us
or something?

20:48.423 --> 20:49.792
- No.
- Oliver?

20:49.826 --> 20:51.426
Oliver, yo.

20:51.459 --> 20:52.527
Yeah, you're interested?

20:52.561 --> 20:54.697
Great, hey, look, there we go.

20:54.730 --> 20:56.732
- All right.
- You're welcome.

20:56.766 --> 21:00.903
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, yeah.

21:00.937 --> 21:01.938
Oh.

21:08.110 --> 21:11.413
Oh, okay,
does anyone else feel like

21:11.446 --> 21:14.449
they're watching a music video
or they're trying not to?

21:14.482 --> 21:15.751
Yeah, I feel like
there's things.

21:15.785 --> 21:18.788
Guys, this stuff
is really strong,

21:18.821 --> 21:21.724
or I'm high still maybe,
or both.

21:23.593 --> 21:25.628
I feel like I need to
get out a lot of energy.

21:25.661 --> 21:27.462
- Does anyone else?
- Yes, yes.

21:27.495 --> 21:30.833
- Same here.
- I feel really jittery.

21:30.867 --> 21:31.934
No, you're just overthinking.

21:31.968 --> 21:33.102
No, that's not normal, is it?

21:33.135 --> 21:34.103
- It's fine.
- I don't know.

21:34.136 --> 21:35.403
Maybe it's all of this?

21:36.939 --> 21:37.974
- It's fine.
- No,

21:38.007 --> 21:39.041
I've seen people on molly.

21:39.075 --> 21:40.843
This doesn't seem like that.

21:40.877 --> 21:44.479
Yeah, I don't know what this is.

21:45.615 --> 21:47.950
- Co-quarantine.
- Best idea ever.

21:47.984 --> 21:50.452
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, Christ, seriously.

21:50.485 --> 21:51.553
Oh, come on.

21:51.587 --> 21:53.589
Oh my God, she's ridiculous.

21:58.895 --> 22:00.930
Okay, you want to record it,
then you can save it forever,

22:00.963 --> 22:02.564
- you know?
- What?

22:02.598 --> 22:04.133
My body feels weirdly
and I don't like it.

22:04.166 --> 22:06.168
Baby, just breathe, okay?

22:06.202 --> 22:07.803
You've gotta let it happen.

22:07.837 --> 22:09.639
Come on, or you're in
for a very long run.

22:09.672 --> 22:11.741
You want me to embrace it?
I just said I don't like it.

22:11.774 --> 22:14.476
Honey, hey, you're gonna
be okay, I promise.

22:14.509 --> 22:15.978
- No, don't be dismissive.
- I'm not.

22:16.012 --> 22:17.179
I'm trying to help you relax.

22:17.213 --> 22:18.446
And you're not helping, are you?

22:18.480 --> 22:20.482
Okay, Liam, Liam, Liam.

22:20.515 --> 22:23.219
- Just give him a beat, okay?
- Yeah, seriously, dude.

22:23.252 --> 22:24.519
He's fine.

22:30.226 --> 22:35.463
Hey, he's gonna be fine,
all right, and he always gets...

22:38.868 --> 22:40.069
Come here, come here.

22:41.237 --> 22:43.873
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

22:43.906 --> 22:47.910
Come on, you're really
freaking out, aren't you?

22:47.944 --> 22:53.215
Hey, I shouldn't have
helped them convince you.

22:53.249 --> 22:55.051
I thought you could
use the escape.

22:56.652 --> 22:58.054
I'm sorry, okay?

22:58.087 --> 22:59.655
- This was my fault.
- No, it's my fault.

22:59.689 --> 23:01.523
Every time this
group gets together,

23:01.556 --> 23:03.793
some ridiculous shit happens
that I have to deal with,

23:03.826 --> 23:05.560
and most of the time,
I have to clean up.

23:05.594 --> 23:06.896
- Hey.
- Well, you're the lawyer.

23:06.929 --> 23:08.597
- That's not funny.
- Hey, Liam, Liam.

23:08.631 --> 23:10.532
- I'm done.
- With what?

23:10.565 --> 23:11.701
The group?

23:16.238 --> 23:19.241
You guys, are you really going
to do that in front of us?

23:19.275 --> 23:22.244
- I mean, come on.
- She's fucking ridiculous.

23:22.278 --> 23:24.013
- Oh my God.
- Whoa, I'm sorry.

23:24.046 --> 23:26.148
No, you're right.
This is not the place for that.

23:26.182 --> 23:27.950
Yeah, it's fucking weird.

23:27.984 --> 23:29.685
I didn't even realize.

23:29.719 --> 23:30.953
To the bedroom.

23:32.154 --> 23:35.523
- Yes, go.
- Come on, daddy.

23:35.557 --> 23:37.525
- You're bad.
- You love it.

23:37.559 --> 23:39.527
- I really do.
- Classy.

23:42.131 --> 23:43.565
- Keep the camera on.
- Try and stop me.

23:43.599 --> 23:46.902
Jesus.

23:46.936 --> 23:48.971
Come on,
what are you doing?

23:49.005 --> 23:50.806
You know
what we're doing.

23:50.840 --> 23:51.907
We're adding a little
excitement to the evening.

23:51.941 --> 23:53.541
Now we've got a party.

23:53.575 --> 23:54.944
Come on,
seriously, guys.

23:54.977 --> 23:58.180
- This is gross.
- That was really amazing.

23:58.214 --> 24:00.750
You guys ready for a show?

24:00.783 --> 24:02.585
Yeah, guys, are you?

24:02.618 --> 24:05.254
Ah, well, this just
got interesting.

24:05.287 --> 24:08.591
- Seriously?
- Perverts.

24:11.260 --> 24:14.263
Oh, that's no fun.

24:14.296 --> 24:16.899
I was just starting
to get into that.

24:16.932 --> 24:19.035
You were starting to get into
watching your two friends

24:19.068 --> 24:21.303
have sex, but, oh, no,
you're just weirded out

24:21.337 --> 24:22.972
about some shit
I did in high school.

24:23.005 --> 24:24.607
- I was kidding.
- Okay, didn't seem like it.

24:26.942 --> 24:30.012
- Hey, come on.
- Don't, don't, don't.

24:30.046 --> 24:31.313
Don't what?

24:31.347 --> 24:32.782
Just don't do that
right now, okay?

24:32.815 --> 24:34.817
Do what right now?
Be playful?

24:34.850 --> 24:36.118
Want my girlfriend?

24:38.120 --> 24:40.689
Jen, it has been 10 years.

24:40.723 --> 24:42.925
Oh, Jesus.

24:42.958 --> 24:45.895
Should be happy that I
still want you every day.

24:45.928 --> 24:47.663
What did you just say to me?

24:49.165 --> 24:51.067
What I'm saying is
that it would be nice

24:51.100 --> 24:53.135
if sex were more than
just a birthday present.

24:53.169 --> 24:55.871
Whoa, come on, Evan.

24:55.905 --> 24:56.939
No, yeah, let's talk about this.

24:56.972 --> 24:58.841
Okay, all right, let's talk.

24:58.874 --> 25:00.743
I'm sick of getting
treated like this, okay.

25:00.776 --> 25:02.144
I do something nice for you

25:02.178 --> 25:03.746
and then you get all
fucking weirded out

25:03.779 --> 25:05.614
about something I did
15 years ago.

25:05.648 --> 25:06.782
I think that's
the drugs talking.

25:06.816 --> 25:08.651
No, no, it's not
the drugs, Evan,

25:08.684 --> 25:10.986
- 'cause I didn't...
- Way to ruin the party.

25:11.020 --> 25:12.755
Oh, so this is my fault?

25:12.788 --> 25:14.390
I didn't ruin the
fucking party, Evan.

25:14.423 --> 25:16.659
You ruined the party when
you got all butt hurt

25:16.692 --> 25:18.861
about something that
happened 15 years ago, yeah.

25:18.894 --> 25:19.895
Fuck that, all right.

25:19.929 --> 25:21.197
Stop trying to control me.

25:21.230 --> 25:22.731
Stop trying to
control everything.

25:22.765 --> 25:24.633
You guys, come on,
just let it go.

25:24.667 --> 25:26.135
You know what, maybe you should
try to control the effort

25:26.168 --> 25:27.770
that you put into
our relationship?

25:27.803 --> 25:30.639
Oh my God, are you
fucking kidding?

25:30.673 --> 25:31.941
You do not want to go
there with me, okay.

25:31.974 --> 25:34.276
You want to talk about effort?

25:34.310 --> 25:36.045
Effort is more than
your desire, Evan.

25:36.078 --> 25:38.647
Why don't you do something
to make me desire you?

25:38.681 --> 25:41.350
Like, I don't know, do something
nice for me, like once.

25:41.383 --> 25:43.786
Brush your teeth,
workout, dress nice.

25:43.819 --> 25:45.754
It's quarantine, Jen.

25:45.788 --> 25:46.889
What does it matter?

25:46.922 --> 25:47.857
Thank you for proving my point.

25:47.890 --> 25:49.258
It does matter.

25:49.291 --> 25:51.327
It matters to me and all
of them notice it, okay,

25:51.360 --> 25:53.329
and this is all we talk
about when you're not here.

25:53.362 --> 25:55.264
Oh, which by the way,
is fucking never,

25:55.297 --> 25:57.366
because we're stuck together.

25:57.399 --> 26:00.069
You know what? When we first
met, you were so different,

26:00.102 --> 26:04.440
and then this all happened,
and now I'm stuck here,

26:04.473 --> 26:06.208
and I was so
excited to tell you.

26:06.242 --> 26:07.443
- I was...
- What?

26:07.476 --> 26:10.813
Tell, Jen, what?

26:14.450 --> 26:15.918
Jen?

26:18.454 --> 26:19.455
- Jen?
- Evan...

26:19.488 --> 26:20.756
Baby, come on.

26:21.891 --> 26:24.326
Talk to me, Jen, Jen.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.762
Oh, please, please, no,
Jen, Jen, Jen, come on.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.430
- You can't...
- Oh my God.

26:30.166 --> 26:31.233
Jen?

26:32.868 --> 26:33.936
- Oh God.
- Evan.

26:36.038 --> 26:37.339
Oh, Jen.

26:37.373 --> 26:39.041
Come on.

26:39.074 --> 26:40.709
Ben, Liam.

26:40.743 --> 26:42.211
- Hey.
- Oh my God.

26:42.244 --> 26:43.879
- Hey.
- She's bleeding a lot.

26:43.913 --> 26:45.915
- Fuck, come on.
- What's going on?

26:45.948 --> 26:47.850
Harper, what happened?

26:48.784 --> 26:50.219
I didn't see it.

26:50.252 --> 26:52.721
I heard a crash and now
Jen's on the ground.

26:52.755 --> 26:56.025
- Jen, Jen.
- What are they saying?

26:56.058 --> 26:58.194
Oh God, oh God, oh my God.

26:58.227 --> 27:01.297
Jen, wake up, baby, wake
up, wake up, please?

27:01.330 --> 27:03.732
- Evan, what did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

27:03.766 --> 27:05.901
- I didn't even touch her.
- Evan, come talk to us.

27:05.935 --> 27:07.369
Come here.

27:07.403 --> 27:10.839
Baby, come on.

27:10.873 --> 27:12.775
- Hey, talk to me.
- Evan, come here.

27:12.808 --> 27:13.809
- Hey.
- Evan.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.811
She's not breathing, okay?

27:15.844 --> 27:17.513
Just try and calm down, okay?

27:17.546 --> 27:18.948
Calm down?

27:18.981 --> 27:20.749
- Are you kidding?
- What the fuck?

27:20.783 --> 27:22.251
Hey, Jen, wake up, come on.

27:23.852 --> 27:25.120
Jen, hey.

27:25.154 --> 27:27.856
- Hey.
- Just tell us what you see.

27:27.890 --> 27:29.491
Nothing.
She's not breathing.

27:29.525 --> 27:30.492
I don't...

27:30.526 --> 27:31.961
Hey, baby, come on.

27:32.928 --> 27:34.196
Just tell me what to do.

27:34.230 --> 27:35.998
What do I do?

27:36.031 --> 27:38.334
Lift her head gently and
see if you can find a wound.

27:41.003 --> 27:42.438
Is it still bleeding?

27:42.471 --> 27:45.274
She hit her head near
the base of her skull.

27:45.307 --> 27:48.777
Okay, okay, check her airway.

27:48.811 --> 27:50.279
Baby, come on, please.

27:51.247 --> 27:52.314
Come on, talk to me.

27:52.348 --> 27:53.549
She's not breathing.

27:53.583 --> 27:54.783
She's just limp.

27:57.152 --> 28:02.291
Fuck, come on,
wake up, baby.

28:02.324 --> 28:05.094
Come on, you can wake up please.

28:05.127 --> 28:06.795
You guys missed
something real special.

28:06.829 --> 28:10.165
Ollie, please, just
tell me something.

28:10.199 --> 28:11.934
What do you see?

28:11.967 --> 28:13.202
What's happening?

28:13.235 --> 28:14.536
- Jen.
- Harper?

28:14.570 --> 28:16.438
What happened to Jen?

28:16.472 --> 28:18.240
You guys, there was a crash

28:18.274 --> 28:20.442
and now she's on
the fucking ground.

28:21.410 --> 28:23.545
- Oh my God.
- What?

28:23.580 --> 28:24.913
- Oh my God.
- Come on, talk to me, Jen.

28:24.947 --> 28:26.015
Evan, what did you do?

28:28.984 --> 28:30.953
- I didn't see it.
- Ben, what happened?

28:30.986 --> 28:32.521
We don't know,
we weren't listening.

28:32.554 --> 28:34.156
We had you guys on mute.

28:34.189 --> 28:36.392
Evan, can you at least
come grab the phone

28:36.425 --> 28:38.027
and just show us what happened?

28:39.328 --> 28:40.229
Evan come here.

28:41.196 --> 28:43.966
Oh God, oh God.

28:43.999 --> 28:46.035
Evan, come here. Fuck!

28:48.437 --> 28:51.307
Evan, I need you
to grab the phone

28:51.340 --> 28:52.941
and show us what's happening.

28:52.975 --> 28:54.410
Evan, listen to her.
Evan come on, come on.

28:54.443 --> 28:55.377
Evan!

28:56.579 --> 28:57.513
Hold on.

29:02.384 --> 29:03.352
Oh my God.

29:08.991 --> 29:10.559
Show me the back of her head.

29:15.998 --> 29:17.066
No.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.035
Oh God.

29:20.069 --> 29:21.203
Oh my God, I have
to go over there.

29:21.236 --> 29:23.005
I don't hear a heartbeat.

29:23.038 --> 29:24.106
Are you sure?

29:26.075 --> 29:27.076
Am I sure?

29:27.109 --> 29:29.211
No, I'm not sure doctor,

29:29.244 --> 29:32.214
but she hasn't moved in
the last two minutes.

29:32.247 --> 29:34.883
Oh God, how is this possible?

29:35.685 --> 29:37.119
Hey man, don't panic, okay?

29:38.987 --> 29:40.189
Stop.

29:45.094 --> 29:45.994
She's dead.

29:52.702 --> 29:54.436
We have to call an ambulance.

29:54.470 --> 29:55.971
No ambulance is gonna come
with everything that's going on.

29:56.004 --> 29:58.073
What good is an
ambulance gonna do?

29:58.107 --> 29:59.007
They won't send an ambulance,

29:59.041 --> 30:00.509
they'll send the police.

30:03.613 --> 30:04.614
She's dead.

30:06.616 --> 30:08.250
Okay, but we have
to do something.

30:08.283 --> 30:10.519
He'll end up in a
detention center or worse?

30:10.552 --> 30:12.488
They'll think he killed her.

30:12.521 --> 30:17.559
So...

30:24.099 --> 30:25.702
Evan muted us.

30:25.735 --> 30:27.970
- I have to go over there.
- No, you're not leaving me.

30:28.003 --> 30:29.071
Well, we're the only
ones anywhere near him.

30:29.104 --> 30:30.539
And what are you gonna do?

30:30.572 --> 30:32.174
You're gonna drive when
we've been drinking

30:32.207 --> 30:33.475
and you're on drugs
and it's past curfew?

30:33.509 --> 30:34.611
I need to help my
friend, he's in trouble.

30:34.644 --> 30:36.278
No.

30:36.311 --> 30:40.516
Evan, Evan? Will you
talk to us please Evan.

30:41.150 --> 30:42.184
Evan?

30:44.286 --> 30:47.055
He's not
listening to us.

30:47.089 --> 30:48.457
Okay. Harper, Harper,

30:48.490 --> 30:50.693
just tell us exactly
what happened, okay?

30:50.727 --> 30:54.963
Okay, well, you two were
fucking and then logged off.

30:54.997 --> 30:57.166
Yes Harper, after that.

30:57.199 --> 31:00.969
They were fighting and...
and it got super heated

31:01.003 --> 31:02.571
and I heard a crash,

31:02.605 --> 31:03.673
and then Jen was on the ground.

31:03.706 --> 31:04.707
I didn't see it.

31:07.209 --> 31:08.076
That sounds nothing like them,

31:08.110 --> 31:09.978
they never fight.

31:10.012 --> 31:11.648
Are you sure?
You didn't see anything else?

31:11.681 --> 31:13.750
- That's all you saw?
- Yes, I'm fucking sure, Ollie.

31:13.783 --> 31:16.118
Ben and Liam were in
their own little drama

31:16.151 --> 31:18.721
and then I was trying
to avoid Jen and Evan,

31:18.755 --> 31:24.026
and if drugs aren't
making this any clearer,

31:24.059 --> 31:25.394
I don't know.

31:25.427 --> 31:28.230
Something happened
and now she's dead.

31:32.034 --> 31:34.436
- I'm going over there.
- Oliver?

31:34.470 --> 31:36.104
He's my best friend.

31:36.138 --> 31:37.439
I'm the only one who
can help him right now.

31:37.473 --> 31:39.475
When he unmutes,
tell him I'm on my way.

31:39.508 --> 31:41.043
Oliver, you can't...

31:42.779 --> 31:45.013
You guys, I don't get it.

31:45.047 --> 31:46.783
He would not
intentionally hurt her,

31:46.816 --> 31:48.450
- I know that.
- Yes, I know.

31:48.484 --> 31:50.085
I think the drugs
had something to do...

31:50.118 --> 31:51.119
This is why I don't
do this kind of stuff.

31:51.153 --> 31:52.521
Can you just calm down?

31:52.554 --> 31:55.457
Calm down? Come on,
she's fucking dead.

31:55.491 --> 31:56.759
This is insane.

31:56.793 --> 31:57.760
Please, I'm begging you.

31:57.794 --> 32:00.028
I can't, I can't.

32:08.771 --> 32:11.039
What was that?

32:17.412 --> 32:21.016
- What?
- Fuck, fuck.

32:25.554 --> 32:27.122
Oh my God, what was that?

32:27.155 --> 32:28.457
I know
you're in there.

32:28.490 --> 32:30.559
Fuck. Antonio.

32:32.127 --> 32:33.630
I heard yelling. Hey.

32:34.631 --> 32:36.031
Don't. Fuck!

32:36.833 --> 32:37.800
Yo, Evan! Evan!

32:42.705 --> 32:46.141
Come on, I saw
you turn the lights off.

32:47.376 --> 32:48.745
- Hey, Evan.
- Hey.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.215
I heard you two arguing.

32:53.248 --> 32:54.751
What's going on in there?

32:54.784 --> 32:56.653
Sorry, we were
watching a scary movie.

32:56.686 --> 32:57.854
Do you think he saw her?

32:57.887 --> 32:59.154
Oh, no, no way.

32:59.187 --> 33:00.122
He would have said something.

33:00.155 --> 33:01.758
What is Evan gonna do?

33:01.791 --> 33:03.760
It really didn't sound like
you were watching a movie.

33:03.793 --> 33:06.094
What do you mean it
didn't sound like a movie?

33:06.128 --> 33:08.230
And why are you always
snooping around?

33:09.799 --> 33:11.634
I think he's gonna leave.

33:13.135 --> 33:14.269
What was that?

33:15.237 --> 33:17.774
Jen? You all right there?

33:17.807 --> 33:19.609
We're in quarantine.

33:22.477 --> 33:24.146
See, it's not good
for somebody your age

33:24.179 --> 33:25.682
to be out here right now, okay?

33:28.383 --> 33:30.152
I'm not feeling too well,

33:30.185 --> 33:31.788
so you need to go.

33:31.821 --> 33:33.823
- You don't look so good, Evan.
- Good night, Antonio.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.697
All right, fine.
Have it your way.

33:40.730 --> 33:42.497
Evan, what are you...

33:45.400 --> 33:47.235
Hey, talk to us,
what are you doing?

33:54.777 --> 33:59.782
- Evan, can you come talk to us?
- Evan?

34:04.687 --> 34:06.823
Hey, how
can we help you?

34:07.824 --> 34:09.191
- Evan? Evan?
- Evan

34:13.696 --> 34:15.263
Come here.

34:23.973 --> 34:25.842
What do you...

34:25.875 --> 34:27.342
Did he see anything?

34:31.513 --> 34:32.749
I don't think so.

34:32.782 --> 34:36.451
Since
when do you smoke?

34:43.392 --> 34:50.332
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, I'm back on.

34:50.365 --> 34:52.702
I'm heading over to
you, I'm five out

34:53.936 --> 34:55.772
Man, I don't know what to do.

34:55.805 --> 34:56.906
I should have done something.

34:56.939 --> 34:58.908
I should have been able to help.

35:00.743 --> 35:01.778
Honey, honey.

35:09.919 --> 35:14.489
There was so much that
I wanted to do with her,

35:20.029 --> 35:21.831
so many things I wanted to say.

35:40.382 --> 35:42.018
What? Harper?

35:45.722 --> 35:46.689
Yeah, what is it?

35:49.859 --> 35:51.526
Come on, spit it out.
You're doing that thing with your lips,

35:51.560 --> 35:52.461
we're not idiots.

35:55.765 --> 35:56.866
Come on Harper, what is it?

35:56.899 --> 35:58.366
- Harper?
- Harper?

36:02.504 --> 36:09.511
- Jen was pregnant.
- No.

36:12.982 --> 36:14.016
Fuck.

36:18.988 --> 36:19.989
Do not do that.

36:21.724 --> 36:22.992
Don't do that.

36:24.894 --> 36:26.629
Evan, she told me tonight.

36:26.662 --> 36:29.799
No! If that were true,

36:29.832 --> 36:31.667
I would have known
about it already.

36:32.835 --> 36:34.771
How could you possibly know?

36:36.571 --> 36:38.040
My God, why would she do molly?

36:38.074 --> 36:39.976
She didn't take it.

36:40.009 --> 36:41.778
I know that she didn't.

36:41.811 --> 36:44.747
We had a moment earlier
when we were all cheers-ing.

36:44.781 --> 36:46.849
I know that she didn't take it.

36:46.883 --> 36:48.818
She... she did that
thing where she...

36:48.851 --> 36:49.852
Wait, what thing?

36:57.492 --> 36:59.662
Whenever she doesn't
want to take a shot,

37:02.364 --> 37:03.833
She spits it in the bottle.

37:06.135 --> 37:07.036
Yeah.

37:14.043 --> 37:15.477
When did she tell you?

37:18.915 --> 37:22.051
Tonight, before we all got on.

37:23.853 --> 37:26.956
She was so excited to tell you.

37:26.989 --> 37:29.025
She was just waiting
for the right time.

37:30.026 --> 37:32.128
With everything just,

37:32.161 --> 37:34.997
she wanted to wait till
after your birthday.

37:35.031 --> 37:37.800
Didn't want you to stress out.

37:37.834 --> 37:38.935
So she was...

37:44.173 --> 37:46.042
And I was gonna be a...

37:57.419 --> 37:58.353
And now she's...

38:03.826 --> 38:05.393
What am I gonna do?

38:13.069 --> 38:14.604
I'm turning on to Gower.

38:14.637 --> 38:16.371
We're gonna do whatever
we need to, okay?

38:24.780 --> 38:25.948
What was that?

38:47.169 --> 38:52.108
- This is the police.
- Oh shit.

38:59.949 --> 39:03.119
Officer, I'm
the one who called.

39:03.152 --> 39:05.888
We received a call
about possible domestic abuse.

39:05.922 --> 39:06.989
We need to talk to you.

39:07.023 --> 39:08.057
Open the door.

39:14.797 --> 39:16.632
House is quiet, we cannot enter.

39:20.803 --> 39:22.905
I heard
them fighting earlier.

39:25.141 --> 39:27.176
I think she might be in trouble.

39:27.209 --> 39:29.946
What the fuck am I gonna do?

39:32.281 --> 39:34.150
Mr. Barnes,
open the door.

39:37.519 --> 39:40.723
I've had a bad feeling
about him killing his wife.

39:42.191 --> 39:43.225
Listen, you
know how this works

39:43.259 --> 39:45.161
since you were on the force.

39:45.194 --> 39:46.896
Leave the unit here for an hour
to keep an eye on the place.

39:46.929 --> 39:49.699
We cannot push our
way into a dark house

39:49.732 --> 39:51.200
in the middle of the
night without a warrant.

39:52.601 --> 39:53.970
Mr. Barnes, this is the LAPD.

39:54.003 --> 39:55.972
Please open the door.

40:09.318 --> 40:10.987
I don't know how this happened.

40:14.690 --> 40:15.858
I'm so sorry.

40:24.867 --> 40:26.235
Fuck.

40:27.169 --> 40:28.170
Where's he gonna go?

40:28.204 --> 40:29.972
Where can he go?

40:40.750 --> 40:41.650
Try his cell.

40:42.885 --> 40:43.953
Hold on.

40:57.967 --> 41:00.069
- <i>Hello, you've reached Evan...</i>
- No, nothing.

41:00.102 --> 41:01.569
Try again.

41:08.844 --> 41:09.845
<i>Hello, you've reached Evan,</i>

41:09.879 --> 41:10.880
<i>please leave a message.</i>

41:12.381 --> 41:15.851
Evan, where are you going?

41:15.885 --> 41:19.355
Listen, please just
stay put, okay?

41:19.388 --> 41:21.023
Ollie is not too far behind you.

41:21.891 --> 41:22.992
We can help you.

41:33.869 --> 41:35.671
Come on, Jen.

41:35.704 --> 41:37.273
All right, look, we need to
figure out what to do.

41:37.306 --> 41:38.207
Yeah, no shit.

41:40.876 --> 41:45.014
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

41:45.047 --> 41:47.983
Okay, we're on
video doing drugs.

41:48.017 --> 41:50.252
Jen is dead and we
watched Evan kill her.

41:50.286 --> 41:51.787
That was an accident.

41:51.821 --> 41:52.888
Okay, but it doesn't matter.

41:52.922 --> 41:54.223
We're all a part of this now.

41:54.256 --> 41:55.858
If anyone sees this,
we are screwed.

41:55.891 --> 41:57.126
Baby, how is anyone
gonna see us?

41:57.159 --> 41:58.627
We're in a private video chat.

41:58.661 --> 42:00.696
Private? Are you kidding me?

42:04.733 --> 42:09.004
Either way, Evan isn't some
crazy killer, he's terrified.

42:09.038 --> 42:10.806
No, it doesn't matter, okay?

42:10.840 --> 42:14.376
Imagine if someone like a
cop were to walk in there.

42:25.054 --> 42:26.856
Has Evan been like this before?

42:26.889 --> 42:31.994
- Like what?
- Like angry or violent? Anything?

42:33.229 --> 42:35.764
No way.

42:35.798 --> 42:38.334
I mean, there was all that
stuff after his mom died.

42:39.335 --> 42:40.436
What stuff?

42:40.469 --> 42:42.872
He got into a fight in college,

42:42.905 --> 42:44.340
and then he went to
therapy after that.

42:44.373 --> 42:47.309
He just went through some
stuff a long time ago.

42:48.744 --> 42:51.680
Well, I mean it
was more than once

42:51.714 --> 42:55.084
and that one guy did
end up in the hospital.

42:56.352 --> 42:57.987
It was his mom,
she was his only family.

42:58.020 --> 42:59.355
That would mess anyone up.

43:03.292 --> 43:05.961
Hold on, I'm pulling
onto his street.

43:05.995 --> 43:08.864
I mean, he has to
be nearby still.

43:08.898 --> 43:11.400
Christ, there's cops everywhere
still all over his house.

43:16.038 --> 43:17.873
Where are you, Evan?

43:27.249 --> 43:30.319
You guys, do we need
to call a lawyer?

43:30.352 --> 43:31.320
Ben is a lawyer.

43:33.355 --> 43:36.725
- What?
- What do we do?

43:36.759 --> 43:38.427
Well, I'm a patent lawyer.

43:38.460 --> 43:39.962
So what? You must know somebody.

43:39.995 --> 43:41.463
Somebody in your
practice, something.

43:41.497 --> 43:44.967
I cannot tell them that
I was a part of this,

43:45.000 --> 43:46.268
let them know that
I was doing drugs

43:46.302 --> 43:47.970
and that I saw
someone get killed.

43:48.003 --> 43:51.006
- I'm gonna lose my job.
- All right, all right.

43:51.040 --> 43:53.909
Ben, you must know
some other lawyer.

43:53.943 --> 43:55.511
Oh, I must? I must know someone?

43:55.544 --> 43:57.179
Do any of you know
any fucking lawyers?

43:57.213 --> 43:59.782
Don't tell me to calm down.

43:59.815 --> 44:01.850
I can't even think.
I can't, I'm shaking.

44:01.884 --> 44:03.819
Yeah, this doesn't
feel right, Ollie.

44:05.888 --> 44:07.456
Come on, man.

44:07.489 --> 44:12.294
I feel like I'm on shit tons
of Adderall or whatever.

44:12.328 --> 44:14.430
She's right, man, she's right.

44:14.463 --> 44:15.898
There's something else in this.

44:15.931 --> 44:17.032
This just can't just be molly.

44:17.066 --> 44:18.133
Are you kidding me?

44:23.806 --> 44:26.508
Ollie, tell me I'm wrong, dude.

44:26.542 --> 44:29.411
No, no. I trust this guy,

44:29.445 --> 44:30.479
he's my go to.

44:30.512 --> 44:31.547
Okay, well, when you went to

44:31.581 --> 44:32.881
this trustworthy go to guy,

44:32.915 --> 44:33.916
what did you ask for?

44:33.949 --> 44:34.984
I asked for molly.

44:35.017 --> 44:36.085
I said it's my buddy's birthday,

44:36.118 --> 44:37.219
I need something off the hook.

44:37.253 --> 44:38.887
Something off the fucking hook?

44:38.921 --> 44:40.856
Something from a
fucking lab in Japan?

44:40.889 --> 44:42.258
Yes, it's better
over there, okay?

44:42.291 --> 44:44.159
Maybe it's just something else,

44:44.193 --> 44:48.163
like something stronger
or heavier, you know?

44:48.197 --> 44:51.133
Like an amphetamine
or something?

44:51.166 --> 44:52.167
Like meth?

44:54.103 --> 44:56.338
I feel like I'm gonna crawl
out of my fucking skin.

44:56.372 --> 44:58.007
Where are you, Evan?

45:02.011 --> 45:04.280
Fuck, I can't take
another round of this.

45:04.313 --> 45:07.349
- We have to call the police.
- No, no.

45:07.383 --> 45:09.385
We have to figure out
how to help him

45:09.418 --> 45:11.020
before we get the
police involved.

45:11.053 --> 45:12.488
The police are already there.

45:12.521 --> 45:14.456
Okay, are you guys
fucking out of your mind?

45:14.490 --> 45:16.125
He killed Jen and we don't
even know where he is.

45:16.158 --> 45:17.993
- I'm calling.
- No, no, no, no.

45:18.027 --> 45:19.094
Don't, please, please.

45:21.130 --> 45:23.065
Listen to me,

45:23.098 --> 45:25.434
I don't expect you to understand

45:25.467 --> 45:28.337
that Evan is family to me.

45:33.142 --> 45:34.209
Please.

45:35.878 --> 45:36.845
So I'm not?

45:36.879 --> 45:37.880
Of course you are.

45:37.913 --> 45:40.316
No. You know what?

45:40.349 --> 45:41.950
I am gonna go lay down.

45:41.984 --> 45:43.952
You have five minutes to
talk with your family,

45:43.986 --> 45:45.187
I'm calling either way.

45:51.527 --> 45:58.334
All right guys, it's just us.

45:58.367 --> 45:59.868
What do we do?

46:02.304 --> 46:07.943
Ben's right. This shit is
way too big for us now.

46:07.976 --> 46:12.281
- What?
- You know, with everything, the fucking lockdown

46:12.314 --> 46:15.250
and everything's
closing and reopening

46:15.284 --> 46:21.023
and so many people are
dying every single day,

46:21.056 --> 46:22.891
and there should be a light
at the end of the tunnel,

46:22.925 --> 46:24.661
but there is no light at the
end of the tunnel at this point.

46:24.694 --> 46:26.663
No, stop. Don't do that, Harper.

46:27.697 --> 46:28.964
Do what?

46:30.566 --> 46:32.434
Don't do what you always do.

46:32.468 --> 46:34.937
Shit gets hard and you bail?

46:34.970 --> 46:36.673
Fuck, if I wanted to bail,

46:36.706 --> 46:39.942
I would have left when our
friend broke her fucking neck.

46:44.046 --> 46:46.915
Liam, she's dead.

46:48.250 --> 46:49.485
Look at her, okay?

46:53.122 --> 46:56.091
There's nothing we can do
from this side of the screen.

46:58.994 --> 47:00.396
We have to call the cops,

47:00.429 --> 47:02.498
we have to tell them
exactly what happened,

47:02.531 --> 47:07.970
we have to tell them
everything. Ben's right.

47:08.003 --> 47:13.041
Finally one of you guys is
making sense,.I am calling.

47:20.549 --> 47:22.418
Evan?

47:22.451 --> 47:23.385
My God, looked like they were
gonna break your door down.

47:23.419 --> 47:24.420
Hey, baby, he's alive.

47:24.453 --> 47:25.554
- What?
- Come here.

47:25.588 --> 47:26.922
What are you doing?

47:28.056 --> 47:29.992
I don't think they followed me.

47:30.025 --> 47:31.460
Where are you?
I'm on your street.

47:31.493 --> 47:34.296
- What?
- I'm right down the street.

47:35.297 --> 47:38.033
I'm by that school off Franklin.

47:41.069 --> 47:42.639
On my way.

47:42.672 --> 47:44.973
I'll meet you at the corner.

47:50.145 --> 47:51.447
What happened there?

47:51.480 --> 47:53.182
- What?
- Your hand.

47:57.754 --> 47:59.354
I... jumped the fence,

47:59.388 --> 48:01.691
I guess I didn't see
the points at the top.

48:03.292 --> 48:05.695
I had to loop all the
way up around the hill

48:05.728 --> 48:08.063
by the convenience store.

48:10.032 --> 48:11.066
This is not gonna be okay.

48:11.099 --> 48:12.501
So what are you gonna do?

48:13.803 --> 48:15.237
I'm trying to find my car.

48:19.776 --> 48:20.743
Oh my God, fuck!

48:20.777 --> 48:22.244
Shit, we're losing Evan.

48:23.713 --> 48:24.747
Hey, Evan.

48:28.250 --> 48:30.519
I'm so fucking
over these streams.

48:32.154 --> 48:33.255
Evan?

48:40.630 --> 48:42.364
What are you doing?

48:42.397 --> 48:44.132
If he still isn't in
this neighborhood.

48:44.166 --> 48:45.668
It looks
like he's on Argyle.

48:45.702 --> 48:48.170
Ollie, don't you
think people can find him?

48:48.203 --> 48:49.137
Where he can go.

48:49.171 --> 48:51.206
Where can he go?

49:08.825 --> 49:10.693
Evan, get
out of the street.

49:13.128 --> 49:14.530
So many of them up there,

49:15.497 --> 49:16.599
all the time.

49:19.201 --> 49:20.435
Did they find him?

49:23.706 --> 49:25.775
There's cops everywhere.

49:25.808 --> 49:27.175
Evan?

49:35.384 --> 49:36.786
Where are you going?

49:36.819 --> 49:38.353
I'm on the other
side of the school,

49:38.387 --> 49:39.689
over by Cherimoya.

49:39.722 --> 49:41.390
I know
exactly where you are.

49:41.423 --> 49:43.760
Meet me on the street
by those tennis courts.

49:44.861 --> 49:46.729
Oh shit.

49:46.763 --> 49:48.463
- What was that?
- It's a cop.

49:48.497 --> 49:50.700
What's up, officer?

49:57.840 --> 49:59.141
Oh my God.

49:59.174 --> 50:00.275
Quiet.

50:12.589 --> 50:15.324
Right, I'm sorry,
I'll go home.

50:20.697 --> 50:22.197
Forget those guys.

50:22.230 --> 50:23.465
Every time they pull up...

50:38.280 --> 50:40.415
You must be close
to your apartment now.

50:40.449 --> 50:44.419
- He's lost.
- No, he isn't.

50:44.453 --> 50:46.488
Guys, he's almost there.

50:47.890 --> 50:49.692
Fuck, they're everywhere.

50:49.726 --> 50:51.159
Be careful.

50:51.193 --> 50:53.161
What do you
think he's doing?

51:00.870 --> 51:02.672
He just needs
to find his car.

51:02.705 --> 51:04.172
Then what?

51:04.206 --> 51:05.273
What do you
mean then what?

51:05.307 --> 51:06.676
He needs to go somewhere safe.

51:06.709 --> 51:07.644
When you get
to Oliver's place,

51:07.677 --> 51:09.177
figure out what to do.

51:09.211 --> 51:11.313
Like that
will solve anything.

51:12.782 --> 51:14.182
Can you drop it?

51:14.216 --> 51:16.351
At least until he
gets to Oliver?

51:16.385 --> 51:18.320
You know what they'll
do if they catch me.

51:23.893 --> 51:25.895
There's a checkpoint up ahead.

51:38.340 --> 51:40.843
Can you turn off?

51:40.877 --> 51:42.344
There's a cop
headed right for me.

51:42.377 --> 51:45.815
Fuck.

51:45.848 --> 51:47.549
Holy shit, he went right by me.

51:50.787 --> 51:51.921
Maybe I can go around.

52:04.734 --> 52:08.004
Evan, are you
gonna make it to your car?

52:08.037 --> 52:09.504
He looks so freaked out.

52:09.538 --> 52:11.708
He is freaked out,
he's fucking lost.

52:11.741 --> 52:14.409
I don't know where it's at.

52:15.778 --> 52:18.346
I think I parked it down here.

52:27.757 --> 52:29.491
I don't think I'm
gonna make it to you, bro.

52:29.524 --> 52:30.827
There are cops everywhere.

52:37.399 --> 52:38.433
There it is.

52:39.769 --> 52:41.436
Oh my God,
watch out, Evans.

52:41.470 --> 52:44.239
Hey, stay the
fuck away from here, man.

52:46.008 --> 52:47.744
If not for you...

52:47.777 --> 52:49.912
Get the fuck out of here.

52:51.546 --> 52:53.716
Come on, get out of here.

52:53.750 --> 52:55.017
You little piece of shit,

52:55.051 --> 52:56.351
who the fuck do
you think you are?

52:57.754 --> 52:59.321
Get away.

53:02.759 --> 53:03.826
Get away.

53:05.795 --> 53:08.263
Oh my God,
that's fucking frightening.

53:10.099 --> 53:12.567
Jesus! Fuck!

53:12.602 --> 53:13.870
What is he doing?

53:13.903 --> 53:19.341
- Is he gone?
- He's just staring at me.

53:21.409 --> 53:23.679
Oh, thank God I parked
all the way over here.

53:29.484 --> 53:30.686
Evan, what are you gonna do?

53:30.720 --> 53:32.487
Maybe we can meet
somewhere close.

53:32.521 --> 53:33.856
Maybe you can just like
sit in your car for a minute

53:33.890 --> 53:34.924
and chill until
things calm down.

53:34.957 --> 53:36.391
You know, like lay low.

53:36.424 --> 53:38.661
Can you all just
give me a second?

53:38.694 --> 53:42.364
I need to come down
off whatever we took.

53:42.397 --> 53:44.700
<i>In Atlanta today,
after months of construction,</i>

53:44.734 --> 53:46.636
<i>a wall was completed.</i>

53:49.739 --> 53:51.073
There are checkpoints
everywhere,

53:51.107 --> 53:52.541
but I bet you can
make it to my place.

53:55.878 --> 53:59.347
Holy shit, there's lights
in the next street over.

53:59.381 --> 54:01.349
Get out of there, man.

54:04.120 --> 54:05.721
I'm coming to your place.

54:05.755 --> 54:06.823
I'll meet you there.

54:16.132 --> 54:19.936
Holy shit, it's got
terrible out here.

54:26.075 --> 54:28.443
My God, look at all that.

54:28.476 --> 54:29.912
It's gotten so much worse.

54:34.482 --> 54:35.818
My God.

54:35.852 --> 54:37.787
You should see downtown.

54:43.993 --> 54:45.027
The 101 is up ahead.

54:46.561 --> 54:48.496
Is that a good idea?

54:48.530 --> 54:50.633
How else am I going
to get over to Ollie's?

54:59.809 --> 55:03.946
There are cops
everywhere on the side streets.

55:03.980 --> 55:06.448
Here we go. Jesus.

55:06.481 --> 55:08.150
Do you
see any other cars?

55:09.085 --> 55:10.019
Not yet.

55:11.754 --> 55:12.955
Get off as
soon as you can.

55:12.989 --> 55:14.456
I will.

55:14.489 --> 55:15.691
Take the Sunset exit,

55:15.725 --> 55:17.159
- it was clear yesterday.
- Yeah.

55:31.641 --> 55:33.976
I haven't been out in weeks.

55:35.878 --> 55:36.879
They're so clear.

55:39.115 --> 55:41.017
How far are you
from Oliver's now?

55:41.050 --> 55:42.785
Like five minutes.

55:42.818 --> 55:44.020
There's no one on the road.

55:45.221 --> 55:46.956
Which I guess
is good and bad.

55:49.892 --> 55:51.794
You need to get off the highway.

55:53.763 --> 55:56.666
There's a helicopter
right above me

55:56.699 --> 55:59.869
with its spotlight circling.

56:04.941 --> 56:06.842
Fuck, oh God. Oh no.

56:09.245 --> 56:10.545
Well, where are you?

56:10.579 --> 56:12.648
- Where's this happening?
- Molina.

56:20.890 --> 56:23.025
Show us what you see.

56:23.059 --> 56:24.093
Here.

56:34.569 --> 56:36.072
I'm almost home.

56:36.105 --> 56:38.107
There it is,
I'm getting off the highway.

56:38.140 --> 56:40.209
Good, go past Sunset on
Bronson, but be careful.

56:40.242 --> 56:41.877
I think there's still a
military roadblock there.

56:41.911 --> 56:43.045
I know, I got it.

56:52.655 --> 56:54.256
Hey, how far are
you from Oliver's?

56:54.290 --> 56:55.791
- I'm getting close.
- Okay.

57:17.046 --> 57:18.214
How could I do it?

57:22.118 --> 57:24.587
I can't believe I did that.

57:42.938 --> 57:45.007
Oh, my God.

57:45.041 --> 57:46.776
- What's going on?
- Shut up for a second.

57:59.088 --> 58:00.723
Holy shit, holy shit.

58:12.001 --> 58:13.069
Jesus...

58:14.870 --> 58:16.739
That was too fucking close.

58:20.009 --> 58:21.210
They aren't following me.

58:30.319 --> 58:31.987
Oliver, you're breaking up.

59:18.801 --> 59:20.269
Hey, how close are you?

59:20.302 --> 59:24.073
- I'm right around the corner.
- Park in front.

59:24.106 --> 59:25.207
You're already back,
what happened?

59:25.241 --> 59:26.709
Yeah, Evan is coming over here.

59:26.742 --> 59:29.145
- What?
- Where else is he gonna go, Mia?

59:30.880 --> 59:32.815
You saw what happened.

59:32.848 --> 59:37.052
It was an accident,
he's not a violent guy.

59:37.086 --> 59:38.053
This is my best friend.

59:38.087 --> 59:41.190
We can't have him here.

59:41.223 --> 59:42.925
Evan is not like Danny.

59:42.958 --> 59:44.994
You promised you
would keep me safe

59:45.027 --> 59:46.896
and that I would never end up
in a situation like that again,

59:46.929 --> 59:48.030
and now your friend
who killed someone...

59:48.063 --> 59:49.832
He didn't kill anybody.

59:49.865 --> 59:51.133
Well, his girlfriend is dead
after being in a fight with him.

59:51.167 --> 59:52.168
Nobody knows what happened.

59:52.201 --> 59:53.769
He can't be in this house.

59:53.802 --> 59:55.037
I shouldn't have to
explain that to you.

59:55.070 --> 59:57.306
Baby, you have to trust me.

59:57.339 --> 1:00:00.209
Mia, please, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you, Mia.

1:00:05.014 --> 1:00:06.081
Please.

1:00:08.117 --> 1:00:10.886
Evan, did you make it?

1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:12.821
Talk to us.
What are you doing?

1:00:19.995 --> 1:00:20.863
What was that?

1:00:20.896 --> 1:00:22.798
That's the gate.

1:00:22.831 --> 1:00:24.500
He's already here.

1:00:25.968 --> 1:00:27.336
It's gonna be okay.

1:00:27.369 --> 1:00:29.972
Come on, come on, come on.

1:00:30.005 --> 1:00:32.474
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I promise you.

1:00:35.911 --> 1:00:37.079
Oh shit.

1:00:38.881 --> 1:00:40.849
It's gonna be fine.

1:00:43.452 --> 1:00:46.989
Hey, hey go to the garage,
okay? It's by the roll-up.

1:00:47.022 --> 1:00:47.957
All right.

1:00:49.024 --> 1:00:50.025
What are you doing?

1:00:50.059 --> 1:00:50.926
I'm giving him the car.

1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:52.261
What?

1:00:52.294 --> 1:00:53.796
I'm not going anywhere.

1:01:14.950 --> 1:01:16.151
What are you doing?

1:01:16.185 --> 1:01:17.253
I'm going to try and see.

1:01:17.286 --> 1:01:18.954
Where did Oliver go?

1:01:18.988 --> 1:01:20.923
Are the police
outside your place?

1:01:20.956 --> 1:01:22.925
There's at least one
police car out front.

1:01:22.958 --> 1:01:24.326
He's gonna meet
Evan in the garage.

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:26.195
Mia, what do you see?

1:01:26.228 --> 1:01:28.897
Hold on, here.

1:01:28.931 --> 1:01:30.866
- Is that Evan's car?
- Yeah, that's his.

1:01:30.899 --> 1:01:31.867
Oh shit.

1:01:33.969 --> 1:01:35.404
Are you all seeing this?

1:01:35.437 --> 1:01:36.872
- That's a fucking police car.
- Yeah I know.

1:01:36.905 --> 1:01:37.973
Fuck.

1:02:11.273 --> 1:02:13.142
Where the hell is he, Mia?

1:02:13.175 --> 1:02:15.911
I don't know, but the
police are all over your car.

1:02:19.081 --> 1:02:20.115
God damn it.

1:02:21.116 --> 1:02:22.985
Evan, what are you gonna do?

1:02:23.018 --> 1:02:24.520
I don't know, what should I do?

1:02:25.521 --> 1:02:27.923
Where the fuck is Ollie?

1:02:27.956 --> 1:02:28.891
Hey, Ev.

1:02:32.194 --> 1:02:33.929
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

1:02:35.598 --> 1:02:36.633
What happened tonight?

1:02:36.666 --> 1:02:37.900
We're gonna figure that out.

1:02:37.933 --> 1:02:39.301
I didn't do... I promise you.

1:02:39.335 --> 1:02:40.569
You know I didn't do
anything like that.

1:02:40.603 --> 1:02:42.971
I know, I see that, I know.

1:02:44.173 --> 1:02:45.307
You're okay.

1:02:45.341 --> 1:02:46.408
You're okay.

1:02:46.442 --> 1:02:48.310
It was an accident, all right?

1:02:48.344 --> 1:02:49.912
It was an accident.

1:02:49.945 --> 1:02:51.380
Listen, we're gonna
figure all that out.

1:02:51.413 --> 1:02:52.348
We need to go, you need
to get out of here.

1:02:52.381 --> 1:02:53.382
Hey listen, listen to me.

1:02:53.415 --> 1:02:54.450
Come on, come on, get up.

1:02:54.483 --> 1:02:56.452
Come on, take the car, okay?

1:02:56.485 --> 1:02:58.053
- Take the car.
- Okay, where do I go?

1:02:58.087 --> 1:02:59.154
I don't know,
you gotta get out of here.

1:02:59.188 --> 1:03:01.523
Just go, go to Griffith Park,

1:03:01.557 --> 1:03:03.660
turn off by the...
by the tennis courts.

1:03:03.693 --> 1:03:04.661
Remember those old trees?

1:03:04.694 --> 1:03:06.261
- Yeah.
- Go there.

1:03:06.295 --> 1:03:07.930
- Yeah.
- All right.

1:03:07.963 --> 1:03:09.365
Okay, I can do that.

1:03:10.499 --> 1:03:11.467
There at the front door.

1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:12.901
Oliver.

1:03:14.303 --> 1:03:16.038
Holy shit, I'm so sorry, bro.

1:03:16.071 --> 1:03:18.073
- I shouldn't have come here.
- Hey, don't say sorry.

1:03:19.007 --> 1:03:20.342
Don't say sorry.

1:03:20.376 --> 1:03:21.678
Just... We're gonna
get through it, go.

1:03:21.711 --> 1:03:22.978
All right?

1:03:43.198 --> 1:03:46.636
I think I just saw
someone coming here.

1:04:28.510 --> 1:04:30.145
Holy shit, that was close.

1:04:35.317 --> 1:04:37.620
His garage door
opener is on the visor.

1:04:37.654 --> 1:04:40.088
Hit the second button
and it will open the back gate.

1:04:40.122 --> 1:04:41.457
Jesus.

1:04:41.490 --> 1:04:44.560
Get out of there, Evan,
come on, man.

1:04:59.274 --> 1:05:00.710
LAPD, open up.

1:05:00.743 --> 1:05:03.278
- Where the fuck is Oliver?
- One second!

1:05:03.312 --> 1:05:04.346
He's on his way up.

1:05:04.379 --> 1:05:05.481
All right.

1:05:28.337 --> 1:05:29.739
Hello, officer.

1:05:29.772 --> 1:05:31.507
The vehicle outside
is owned by a suspect

1:05:31.540 --> 1:05:33.776
we are looking for.
Name is Evan Barns.

1:05:33.810 --> 1:05:36.411
He has a known connection
to this household.

1:05:36.445 --> 1:05:39.014
I know him, but I haven't
seen him in a while.

1:05:43.252 --> 1:05:45.354
Is this the residence
of Oliver Harris?

1:05:45.387 --> 1:05:46.689
Yeah, it is.

1:05:46.723 --> 1:05:48.090
I live here too, but
he's not here right now.

1:05:48.123 --> 1:05:49.491
He's taking food
to a sick friend,

1:05:49.525 --> 1:05:51.460
and I don't know
when he'll be back.

1:05:51.493 --> 1:05:52.829
I'm sure he's gonna stay
at the guy's guest house

1:05:52.862 --> 1:05:54.664
cause it's past curfew
and everything.

1:05:54.697 --> 1:05:56.431
Things have gotten a lot
worse out here at night.

1:05:56.465 --> 1:05:58.400
And so have the penalties
for breaking curfew.

1:05:58.433 --> 1:05:59.636
Of course.

1:05:59.669 --> 1:06:01.336
Under Los Angeles
City Code 6A,

1:06:01.370 --> 1:06:03.572
I'm conducting a lawful
search of this household.

1:06:03.606 --> 1:06:05.574
Please put on a mask, ma'am.

1:06:05.608 --> 1:06:07.677
- You're alone.
- I am.

1:06:07.710 --> 1:06:08.778
<i>Status?</i>

1:06:08.811 --> 1:06:10.613
Resident is complying.

1:06:10.647 --> 1:06:14.049
Living room is down that way
and bedrooms are upstairs.

1:06:17.152 --> 1:06:18.287
<i>No sign
of him down here.</i>

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:19.756
Copy that.

1:06:19.789 --> 1:06:21.523
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

1:06:21.557 --> 1:06:24.560
You need to move that to
street level... dark in here.

1:06:24.594 --> 1:06:26.495
I was about to go to bed.

1:06:27.830 --> 1:06:29.832
Officer 17921
checking premises.

1:06:31.133 --> 1:06:32.234
First level is clear.

1:06:34.303 --> 1:06:36.171
If you want,
I can call my boyfriend.

1:06:36.204 --> 1:06:38.808
Please stay where you are.
This won't take long.

1:06:38.841 --> 1:06:40.576
Kitchen and living room
are clear.

1:06:41.376 --> 1:06:42.311
Heading upstairs.

1:06:45.882 --> 1:06:47.249
<i>Waiting at vehicle.</i>

1:06:49.719 --> 1:06:51.788
I can barely breathe.
Where the hell is Oliver?

1:06:51.821 --> 1:06:53.690
Shh, calm down.

1:06:53.723 --> 1:06:56.659
- He won't find anything.
- Will he?

1:06:56.693 --> 1:06:59.862
- I don't know, I don't know.
- More drugs?

1:06:59.896 --> 1:07:01.898
Anything?

1:07:01.931 --> 1:07:03.532
I don't think he could keep
that stuff here. I don't know.

1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:07.302
House is clear,
no sign of suspect.

1:07:10.707 --> 1:07:12.541
Thank you for your compliance.

1:07:12.574 --> 1:07:14.811
I'm happy to help.

1:07:14.844 --> 1:07:16.578
What are you gonna do
if you find him?

1:07:16.613 --> 1:07:19.749
You know the penalty
for breaking curfew.

1:07:19.782 --> 1:07:23.318
He'll be taken to the local
detention center and dealt with.

1:07:23.352 --> 1:07:25.187
- What did he do?
- Why are you looking?

1:07:25.220 --> 1:07:27.255
Just contact the police
immediately if you see him.

1:07:27.289 --> 1:07:29.659
- Of course.
- It's not safe for anyone out here.

1:07:57.720 --> 1:07:59.354
What the fuck, Ollie?

1:07:59.388 --> 1:08:01.490
Sorry I heard the officer,
I didn't think...

1:08:01.523 --> 1:08:03.626
I don't understand. How did they
even know where you were, Evan?

1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:05.595
I don't know.

1:08:05.628 --> 1:08:07.664
I was the only car out there.
I mean, you know how it is now.

1:08:10.265 --> 1:08:13.936
- I handled it.
- What'd you say?

1:08:13.970 --> 1:08:17.707
You promised to have my back,
I promise to have yours.

1:08:20.643 --> 1:08:21.778
Thank you.

1:08:21.811 --> 1:08:23.512
Are you two okay?

1:08:23.545 --> 1:08:25.848
Yeah.
Where are you?

1:08:25.882 --> 1:08:28.851
I'm over off Silver Lake
headed towards Griffith.

1:09:20.402 --> 1:09:21.704
Oh shit.

1:09:21.738 --> 1:09:22.739
There's a cop headed
straight for me.

1:09:22.772 --> 1:09:23.940
Drive slow.

1:09:23.973 --> 1:09:25.608
No, drive normal.

1:09:28.343 --> 1:09:29.712
Fuck.

1:09:29.746 --> 1:09:31.581
Fuck.
Fuck.

1:09:31.614 --> 1:09:33.049
Fuck.
Do I turn off?

1:09:33.082 --> 1:09:34.516
- Yes.
- No.

1:09:34.549 --> 1:09:36.619
- No.
- No, no, no, don't turn off,

1:09:36.652 --> 1:09:37.720
he's gonna follow you
if you turn off.

1:09:37.754 --> 1:09:38.721
Just keep driving.

1:09:38.755 --> 1:09:39.722
You guys are not helping.

1:09:41.523 --> 1:09:43.960
Oh shit, he just turned around
and started following me.

1:09:43.993 --> 1:09:46.028
- No.
- Okay, all right, listen.

1:09:46.062 --> 1:09:48.765
Hey, stay calm, okay?
And just drive slow.

1:09:48.798 --> 1:09:53.870
Evan, if you turn yourself in,
we can find help.

1:09:53.903 --> 1:09:55.004
Babe he needs a lawyer,
and we...

1:09:55.037 --> 1:09:55.938
Shh.

1:09:57.039 --> 1:09:59.508
You know who I should call.

1:09:59.541 --> 1:10:01.010
No.

1:10:01.043 --> 1:10:02.845
Danny is the best
criminal lawyer. I need to...

1:10:02.879 --> 1:10:03.746
Absolutely not.

1:10:03.780 --> 1:10:04.814
What?

1:10:04.847 --> 1:10:06.515
- Why?
- Who is that?

1:10:06.548 --> 1:10:08.316
- I hate the guy.
- Okay, well personal feelings

1:10:08.350 --> 1:10:09.886
don't really matter
right now. Okay, Ollie?

1:10:09.919 --> 1:10:11.020
Please Mia, please.

1:10:11.053 --> 1:10:12.822
You have no idea.

1:10:12.855 --> 1:10:14.523
This guy was terrible to her.

1:10:14.556 --> 1:10:15.825
All right, then.

1:10:15.858 --> 1:10:17.927
No, someone else.

1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:19.962
Oliver, we're out of time.

1:10:19.996 --> 1:10:22.430
Danny deals with this stuff.
He specializes in it.

1:10:22.464 --> 1:10:25.400
He's a big-time trial lawyer.
What else are we gonna do?

1:10:25.433 --> 1:10:27.069
- I should call him.
- Yes, she is right.

1:10:27.103 --> 1:10:29.038
- You should call him.
- This has gotten so out of hand.

1:10:29.071 --> 1:10:30.773
I should have
called him before.

1:10:33.743 --> 1:10:34.911
Okay, okay.

1:10:34.944 --> 1:10:36.478
I'm right here with you.

1:10:36.511 --> 1:10:38.781
Okay, I'll be right back.

1:10:43.451 --> 1:10:44.754
Danny.

1:10:44.787 --> 1:10:47.422
I know, I know,
and I'm sorry, it's late.

1:10:47.455 --> 1:10:49.592
Look, okay, can you just
stop for one second

1:10:49.625 --> 1:10:50.726
and listen to me?

1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:52.628
Look, our friend is in trouble.

1:10:52.662 --> 1:10:53.896
The police were just here,
and I really need your help.

1:10:53.930 --> 1:10:55.698
Hey, Ollie,
what happened with them?

1:10:55.731 --> 1:10:56.866
This is the guy
she was stuck with

1:10:56.899 --> 1:10:58.801
at the beginning of all this.

1:10:58.835 --> 1:11:00.502
Okay.

1:11:00.535 --> 1:11:01.604
The fact that she would
even call him for us.

1:11:01.637 --> 1:11:03.371
I don't know what to say.

1:11:05.875 --> 1:11:09.679
Okay, Evan, Evan, go to the
Hollywood police station.

1:11:09.712 --> 1:11:12.748
358 North Wilcox,
Danny will meet you there.

1:11:12.782 --> 1:11:14.617
Okay, I know where that is.

1:11:14.650 --> 1:11:16.384
And park down the street,
and do not go in without him.

1:11:16.418 --> 1:11:17.753
And if anybody sees you,
tell them

1:11:17.787 --> 1:11:18.921
that your lawyer is on the way.

1:11:18.955 --> 1:11:22.124
Mia, thank you.

1:11:22.158 --> 1:11:24.727
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1:11:26.428 --> 1:11:28.363
I know if he tried anything
I got you.

1:11:30.465 --> 1:11:33.069
Oh fuck.

1:11:33.102 --> 1:11:34.737
Oh God, Mia he's
not gonna make it.

1:11:34.770 --> 1:11:37.640
I'm freaking out
'cause I'm on drugs.

1:11:37.673 --> 1:11:40.508
- No, calm down.
- And I'm out here past curfew.

1:11:40.542 --> 1:11:42.477
No, calm down, calm down.

1:11:42.510 --> 1:11:43.813
- He doesn't know any of that.
- Just don't say anything, Evan.

1:11:43.846 --> 1:11:45.581
Don't say shit.

1:11:45.615 --> 1:11:46.582
<i>Pull the
vehicle over immediately.</i>

1:11:46.616 --> 1:11:48.117
Nobody's gonna believe.

1:11:48.150 --> 1:11:49.752
<i>You already
violated the curfew,</i>

1:11:49.785 --> 1:11:50.753
<i>pull over and turn
the vehicle off.</i>

1:11:50.786 --> 1:11:52.454
What should I do?

1:11:52.487 --> 1:11:53.823
Should I, should, should I,
should I pull over

1:11:53.856 --> 1:11:55.157
or should I just
drive to the station?

1:11:55.191 --> 1:11:57.894
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, okay?

1:11:57.927 --> 1:11:59.662
Right now just
don't say anything.

1:12:00.930 --> 1:12:02.031
Fuck.

1:12:11.908 --> 1:12:13.142
What should I do?

1:12:13.175 --> 1:12:14.777
Right now,
just don't say anything.

1:12:14.810 --> 1:12:15.811
That's all you can do.

1:12:15.845 --> 1:12:16.746
Don't say anything.

1:12:19.215 --> 1:12:20.950
Evan, what's happening?

1:12:20.983 --> 1:12:22.818
Nothing.

1:12:22.852 --> 1:12:24.787
He hasn't gotten
out of his car yet.

1:12:35.865 --> 1:12:37.199
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:12:43.739 --> 1:12:45.107
Evan, I'm not kidding,

1:12:45.141 --> 1:12:47.910
whatever you do,
don't say anything to them.

1:12:50.012 --> 1:12:52.615
- Maybe I should.
- Stay in your vehicle.

1:12:58.654 --> 1:13:00.522
I'm gonna tell him
what happened.

1:13:00.555 --> 1:13:02.858
I'm gonna call Danny. Tell me
exactly where you are, Evan.

1:13:06.561 --> 1:13:10.066
I don't know,
Sunset and something.

1:13:10.099 --> 1:13:12.768
Danny, they pulled him over.
I don't know.

1:13:20.542 --> 1:13:22.712
I'm gonna tell him what happened.
I can't just sit here.

1:13:22.745 --> 1:13:25.281
No, no, don't say a word.

1:13:25.314 --> 1:13:27.183
- Don't do that.
- Stay in your car.

1:13:27.216 --> 1:13:29.585
- Do not get out of the car.
- Get back in your car

1:13:29.618 --> 1:13:30.619
and put your hands on
the steering wheel.

1:13:30.653 --> 1:13:31.787
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:13:31.821 --> 1:13:32.888
Get back
in the vehicle.

1:13:32.922 --> 1:13:35.024
Just listen to me, please.

1:13:35.057 --> 1:13:36.558
No, no, I don't give a shit.
Hands on the steering wheel.

1:13:36.592 --> 1:13:38.594
- Back in the vehicle now.
- Just calm down.

1:13:38.627 --> 1:13:39.929
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Back in the vehicle,

1:13:39.962 --> 1:13:41.297
hands on the fucking
steering wheel.

1:13:41.330 --> 1:13:42.765
Just, just listen to me.
You don't understand,

1:13:42.798 --> 1:13:44.300
- it was an accident, okay?
- Fuck.

1:13:44.333 --> 1:13:45.935
I was on my way to the
station to turn myself in.

1:13:45.968 --> 1:13:47.803
Suspect has
fresh blood on his hands.

1:13:47.837 --> 1:13:48.904
Here.

1:13:51.807 --> 1:13:53.541
Hands where
I can see them.

1:13:53.575 --> 1:13:54.844
They were all watching,
I didn't mean to kill her.

1:13:54.877 --> 1:13:55.878
Get back.

1:14:00.916 --> 1:14:02.284
Suspect is down.

1:14:03.786 --> 1:14:04.887
Holy fucking shit.

1:14:07.923 --> 1:14:09.291
Evan.

1:14:09.325 --> 1:14:12.028
Oh my God, Danny,
he got out of the car

1:14:12.061 --> 1:14:14.063
and the cop shot him.

1:14:14.096 --> 1:14:15.831
I don't know.

1:14:15.865 --> 1:14:17.199
Copy that,
back-up is en route.

1:14:17.233 --> 1:14:18.734
Will wait till approach.

1:14:20.269 --> 1:14:22.304
Fucking do something, help him.

1:14:28.744 --> 1:14:30.613
We are watching on chat,
it doesn't record.

1:14:30.646 --> 1:14:32.014
I don't think.

1:14:32.048 --> 1:14:35.751
Oh fuck, this can get
traced back to us.

1:14:35.785 --> 1:14:38.187
Guys we have to log off,
we have to log off right now.

1:14:38.220 --> 1:14:40.689
- Everyone has to log off.
- No.

1:14:45.961 --> 1:14:49.298
Hello? Do you hear us?

1:14:49.331 --> 1:14:50.232
He's gonna die.

1:15:02.244 --> 1:15:04.080
Oh, what happened?

1:15:04.113 --> 1:15:06.082
Oh my God.
Oliver.

1:15:07.349 --> 1:15:09.752
- Babe, what is going on?
- Oliver.

1:15:14.957 --> 1:15:16.692
Jane, Jane, how can you?

1:15:16.725 --> 1:15:18.360
- How is this?
- Oh my God.

1:15:18.394 --> 1:15:20.896
- Are you okay?
- Oh my God, we were sure you were...

1:15:20.930 --> 1:15:24.900
We thought you were dead?

1:15:24.934 --> 1:15:26.068
What?

1:15:28.137 --> 1:15:29.105
What happened?

1:15:29.138 --> 1:15:32.074
Where's Evan, my head.

1:15:32.108 --> 1:15:33.209
Are you okay?

1:15:34.810 --> 1:15:37.980
There's blood everywhere.
I don't...

1:15:38.013 --> 1:15:39.615
I don't remember what...

1:15:50.159 --> 1:15:51.794
Suspect...

1:15:51.827 --> 1:15:52.795
Suspected in
breaking the curfew.

1:15:52.828 --> 1:15:56.198
...reaching for a weapon.

1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:05.708
Jane.

1:16:11.213 --> 1:16:12.314
What the fuck?

1:16:12.348 --> 1:16:14.150
Hey, what happened?

1:16:15.751 --> 1:16:16.952
What happened?

1:16:18.988 --> 1:16:21.190
It's impossible,
it's impossible.

1:16:22.391 --> 1:16:27.062
Where are you?

1:16:27.096 --> 1:16:28.364
You're alive.

1:16:32.034 --> 1:16:35.171
Evan, oh my God, oh my God.

1:16:35.204 --> 1:16:36.805
How are you alive?

1:16:36.839 --> 1:16:37.706
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.

1:16:37.740 --> 1:16:39.341
I just woke up.

1:16:41.410 --> 1:16:43.746
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1:16:43.779 --> 1:16:46.215
Hey, hey, hey, help him, please.

1:16:50.786 --> 1:16:53.022
Hey, why aren't you helping him?
Help him.

1:16:54.423 --> 1:17:00.930
I'm so excited to
be with you again.

1:17:00.963 --> 1:17:06.001
To have a family with you,
to do all things we talked about.

1:17:08.103 --> 1:17:10.806
We're gonna have all that, okay?
I promise.

1:17:14.210 --> 1:17:17.079
There is so much I wanted to
tell you, I was so excited.

1:17:18.347 --> 1:17:19.882
But I waited, it just...

1:17:22.484 --> 1:17:24.920
You're gonna be
such a great mom.

1:17:24.954 --> 1:17:26.789
No stop, stop, okay?

1:17:28.357 --> 1:17:30.893
You are gonna be
an amazing father.

1:17:37.366 --> 1:17:43.472
- I love you.
- No, hey.

1:18:06.829 --> 1:18:07.896
Hey, hey.

1:18:09.565 --> 1:18:11.300
Hey, help him.

1:18:11.333 --> 1:18:14.103
Hey, why aren't you helping him?

1:18:14.136 --> 1:18:15.838
Come on.

1:18:15.871 --> 1:18:16.872
Back up units
and forensic investigators

1:18:16.905 --> 1:18:18.540
arriving on the scene now.

1:18:18.574 --> 1:18:20.509
What are you doing?

1:18:20.542 --> 1:18:21.944
No, no, no, no.

1:18:25.147 --> 1:18:26.348
What the fuck.

1:18:32.187 --> 1:18:33.322
How could you do that?

1:18:33.355 --> 1:18:35.824
How could you just let him die?

1:18:39.495 --> 1:18:43.065
Suspect appears to have been on
some sort of video chat app.

1:18:43.098 --> 1:18:45.100
- I count six viewers.
- Shit.

1:18:51.507 --> 1:18:54.176
How can you do this?

1:18:59.315 --> 1:19:03.385
