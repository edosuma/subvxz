00:33.105 --> 00:35.266
All right, Manger Babies.

00:35.374 --> 00:37.433
We are on right after the weather report.

00:37.543 --> 00:40.944
So, if anyone has to go to the bathroom,
tell me now.

00:42.381 --> 00:45.976
Well, it looks like that storm brewing
in Big Bend will miss Heimlich County...

00:46.085 --> 00:49.953
and plant a big sloppy kiss on
the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.

00:50.122 --> 00:52.613
- Sorry, Big D.
- Thanks, Nancy.

00:53.092 --> 00:55.652
On a personal note,
I will be on vacation next week.

00:55.895 --> 01:00.229
So, Nancy, I'd like to be the first
to wish you a happy 40th birthday.

01:02.001 --> 01:03.832
Why, thank you, Berle.

01:04.169 --> 01:08.333
For 40-year-old Nancy Hicks Gribble
on weather and Don Ringle on sports...

01:08.707 --> 01:11.039
this is Berle Arlington bidding you...

01:11.143 --> 01:13.441
good night and God bless.

01:14.713 --> 01:15.907
And clear.

01:16.015 --> 01:17.676
Hey, beautiful!

01:17.950 --> 01:21.442
Prepare yourself to be whisked, as in olÃ©.

01:21.820 --> 01:26.519
I am taking you to the La Grunta Resort
for a birthday weekend you will not forget.

01:27.860 --> 01:30.795
I think I'd rather celebrate
my birthday quietly at home.

01:30.896 --> 01:33.558
Too late. Your credit card is already billed.

01:33.666 --> 01:36.226
Now, let's go pamper you.

01:38.837 --> 01:42.568
DALE: The odd thing is I hate dirt,
but I love mud.

01:57.022 --> 02:01.322
It's hailing! I've got to get back to the
station. This is sweeps-worthy weather.

02:04.697 --> 02:08.997
Our Weather Watcher in Rumpert says
the hail is now dodge-ball size.

02:09.401 --> 02:11.266
We gotta go live!

02:12.304 --> 02:13.464
You okay?

02:13.606 --> 02:16.040
You, puppet girl, can you read?

02:19.144 --> 02:22.636
"And the National Weather Service
predicts the storm will..."

02:24.083 --> 02:27.450
Slow down! The words are going too fast.

02:27.753 --> 02:29.653
Damn it. She's wearing blue.

02:29.855 --> 02:31.846
...for two more days
before finally clearing.

02:31.957 --> 02:33.822
It's a good color on her.

02:34.093 --> 02:38.553
Anyways, it's going to keep raining and
hailing and thundering and lightning-ing...

02:38.664 --> 02:39.631
for a while.

02:39.765 --> 02:41.995
So, hug your babies tight.

02:42.968 --> 02:47.405
LUANNE: And back to you, Mr. Arlington.
BERLE: Call me Berle.

02:47.539 --> 02:48.506
LUANNE: Berle.

02:48.774 --> 02:51.971
I got here as fast as I could, Tom.
I am ready to go on.

02:52.077 --> 02:55.308
Hey, Nancy, we are going
to shake things up a little.

02:55.414 --> 02:59.111
I am making you the late night
weekend weather girl.

02:59.218 --> 03:01.652
Luanne is going to take over
the morning weather slot.

03:06.358 --> 03:10.124
I used to think these lines gave me
integrity as a weather journalist.

03:10.596 --> 03:13.463
But who am I kidding?
They are just wrinkles.

03:13.565 --> 03:15.055
I blame the mirror.

03:15.167 --> 03:18.364
I've seen a mirror turn
an ordinary man 10 feet tall.

03:18.470 --> 03:21.530
And another turn
the same man 3 feet short.

03:22.107 --> 03:24.041
That man was me.

03:24.410 --> 03:28.312
I am getting old, Dale.
And I am in a younger, prettier business.

03:28.414 --> 03:29.381
Oh, God!

03:29.848 --> 03:32.248
I need a face-lift or a time machine.

03:34.987 --> 03:38.582
And your smoking is not helping.
Cigarettes are hell on skin.

03:38.691 --> 03:41.023
You know I can't quit.

03:43.696 --> 03:46.961
What do you think, Dr. Mark Seldon?
Can you take care of my baby?

03:47.066 --> 03:48.966
Absolutely. I am very good.

03:49.368 --> 03:51.893
I just want to look like me, 20 years ago.

03:52.104 --> 03:54.231
What's this face-ectomy going to run us?

03:54.473 --> 03:55.497
$5,000.

03:55.607 --> 03:58.872
It will take us 20 years to save
that kind of money.

03:59.011 --> 04:01.912
And then you will have
to make her look 40 years younger.

04:02.014 --> 04:04.676
And we'll never be able to afford that!

04:06.652 --> 04:08.643
Why would Nancy want a face-lift?

04:08.754 --> 04:11.052
There's nothing wrong with
the face God gave her.

04:11.156 --> 04:14.819
I am with you.
But my baby gets what my baby wants.

04:14.927 --> 04:19.125
There is no procedure, however gruesome,
I could ever deny her.

04:19.231 --> 04:22.894
How're you gonna pay for it?
Are you taking Dale's Dead Bug public?

04:23.035 --> 04:25.401
Good idea. But nope.

04:25.504 --> 04:28.632
I filed a $5,000-dollar suit
in small-claims court...

04:28.741 --> 04:32.108
against one Reynolds Penland,
Chairman and CEO...

04:32.211 --> 04:34.679
of the Manitoba Tobacco Corporation.

04:34.780 --> 04:39.410
I will allege the second-hand smoke from
his fine product has wrinkled my wife...

04:39.651 --> 04:43.644
jeopardizing her job because she
is unattractive to weather-watchers...

04:43.756 --> 04:46.987
and her marriage
because she is unattractive to me.

04:47.359 --> 04:50.556
You know, who you ought to
be suing is the Arlen school system.

04:50.729 --> 04:54.893
How one of their graduates could come up
with a plan this dumb is beyond me.

04:55.134 --> 04:57.830
No. My plan is brilliant.

04:58.504 --> 05:01.473
I could be suing those cigarette moguls
for billions.

05:01.573 --> 05:05.009
They will never show up in court
to save a measly five large.

05:05.110 --> 05:07.670
They pee wine that costs more than that.

05:07.813 --> 05:10.748
- I will get a default judgment.
- Brilliant.

05:13.752 --> 05:16.846
Four, three, two, one.

05:18.090 --> 05:21.821
9:00 a.m. On the dot and
the dastardly coward didn't show.

05:22.261 --> 05:24.889
I will just take my money now
and skedaddle.

05:29.935 --> 05:31.129
Oh, poo!

05:31.570 --> 05:33.231
Your Honor, I am Jeremy Toblik...

05:33.338 --> 05:36.171
lead counsel for the
Manitoba Tobacco Corporation...

05:36.275 --> 05:38.402
and its CEO, Reynolds Penland.

05:41.213 --> 05:46.116
It appears this case has been removed
to Federal District Court across the street.

05:46.952 --> 05:49.182
Where they will write my check?

05:49.288 --> 05:53.782
Mr. Gribble, the Manitoba Tobacco
Corporation has just counter-sued you...

05:53.892 --> 05:55.951
for $1.3 million dollars.

05:56.595 --> 05:58.654
Have a nice day in court.

05:59.598 --> 06:01.930
You weren't supposed to show up!

06:05.137 --> 06:06.968
PENLAND: Don't underestimate this guy.

06:07.072 --> 06:08.801
He's the only customer in our database...

06:08.907 --> 06:11.808
who has earned every single item
in our gift catalog.

06:12.010 --> 06:16.242
You've got to smoke 90,000 cigarettes just
to get the satineen jacket.

06:17.015 --> 06:19.984
Now, let's be honest.
He should be dead by now.

06:20.586 --> 06:22.144
I am not putting you on the stand.

06:22.254 --> 06:25.121
Don't worry. We are placing Gribble
under electronic surveillance.

06:25.224 --> 06:26.521
Observation.

06:26.792 --> 06:30.888
Best-case scenario, we catch Gribble
playing lovey-dovey with his wife...

06:30.996 --> 06:32.054
and destroy his credibility.

06:32.164 --> 06:36.100
- I don't want to know about this.
- It can't be traced back to you.

06:36.201 --> 06:39.659
We hired a local P.I. And we are
paying him out of our snack-cake division.

06:40.939 --> 06:42.736
[Dale panting heavily]

06:44.309 --> 06:47.870
The lawyers subpoenaed my records.
That's the first step.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.947
The second step will be to kidnap
everyone I've ever known...

06:51.049 --> 06:52.607
and erase their memories.

06:52.718 --> 06:54.913
The third step will be to kill me!

06:55.020 --> 06:58.615
Dale, they are suing you.
They are not gonna kill you.

06:58.924 --> 07:00.482
Wake up, Hank!

07:00.592 --> 07:05.461
These people kill 400,000 of
their own satisfied customers every year!

07:05.998 --> 07:09.126
Dale, do yourself a favor
and just drop the case.

07:09.234 --> 07:10.929
Maybe they will go easy on you.

07:16.074 --> 07:19.373
How do you know
maybe they will go easy on me?

07:21.346 --> 07:23.974
They got to you, didn't they, Hank Hill?

07:24.116 --> 07:27.415
Or should I say, Reynolds Penland?

07:27.519 --> 07:29.487
Peel off your fake face, Penland.

07:29.621 --> 07:31.782
Come on, peel it off. Like this.

07:33.725 --> 07:35.124
From the bottom up.

07:37.763 --> 07:41.096
Penland, you just bought yourself
an assault charge.

07:45.237 --> 07:47.467
- Dale Gribble?
- Yes!

07:47.806 --> 07:51.105
- Got a package for you.
- Goody-goody. What'd I get?

07:54.346 --> 07:57.747
It's Smoking Sammy Salmon,
the singing Manitoba fish.

07:57.883 --> 08:01.546
This is a corporate Christmas present
not available to the public.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.687
Enjoy.

08:03.121 --> 08:07.524
Look, Nancy! It's Smoking Sammy Salmon,
the singing Manitoba fish.

08:09.761 --> 08:10.728
Wow!

08:10.929 --> 08:14.763
Luanne is one hot fudge sundae
with two big scoops.

08:17.436 --> 08:20.030
Wait! This will cheer you up.

08:20.138 --> 08:21.605
LUANNE: It's the five-day forecast.

08:21.740 --> 08:24.300
[Singing] Manitoba is the brand to smoke

08:24.409 --> 08:26.502
You'll enjoy it toke for toke

08:26.678 --> 08:28.373
Don't worry

08:29.648 --> 08:31.013
Keep smoking

08:31.683 --> 08:32.650
A bug!

08:34.251 --> 08:37.221
A grotesque, flying water beetle.

08:37.556 --> 08:40.285
Will you excuse me, Nancy?

08:40.392 --> 08:43.121
They are bugging me! My God! I can't!

08:48.033 --> 08:49.660
Dale! Come in.

08:49.968 --> 08:53.062
I was just, you know, drinking beer.

09:03.115 --> 09:04.082
What?

09:05.183 --> 09:08.346
- I am being bugged.
- What?

09:11.089 --> 09:13.319
I am being bugged!

09:14.326 --> 09:17.022
By the Manitoba Tobacco Corporation.

09:17.462 --> 09:21.922
Was it like when the Norwegian Secret
Police planted a bug in your person?

09:22.434 --> 09:25.665
No. These guys are amateurs
to be trifled with.

09:26.004 --> 09:28.370
In the spirit of aikido...

09:29.474 --> 09:31.567
I will turn their bug against them...

09:31.676 --> 09:35.112
and feed it a steady diet
of strategic disinformation...

09:35.213 --> 09:39.309
i.e., I will insult Nancy's appearance
so convincingly...

09:39.418 --> 09:42.546
they will offer me
a large out-of-court settlement.

09:43.121 --> 09:46.284
I get it. And Nancy will pretend to cry.

09:46.491 --> 09:50.450
No. No pretending.
Nancy's a terrible actress.

09:50.562 --> 09:54.555
Remember how her Eliza Doolittle
"did little" for the critics?

09:54.933 --> 09:58.926
For my insults to be effective, Nancy must
remain completely in the dark...

09:59.037 --> 10:03.974
her reactions real and unscripted,
like a Dean Martin roast.

10:09.181 --> 10:11.172
I got a new dress for work today.

10:12.117 --> 10:15.985
Baby. Come here and let me get
a good look at you.

10:16.755 --> 10:20.714
- I love the dress. But what's with the face?
- What?

10:20.826 --> 10:23.590
I am just saying you might want to get
a skycap to help you...

10:23.695 --> 10:26.391
with those bags under your eyes.

10:31.069 --> 10:35.631
DALE: Nancy, dearest, your smoke-ravaged
face is making me nauseous.

10:35.740 --> 10:40.040
Would you mind putting this Kroger bag
over your head so I can make love to you?

10:40.145 --> 10:41.578
NANCY: Get out!

10:41.813 --> 10:43.280
The man's an animal.

10:43.381 --> 10:46.544
The only person the jury's going to hate
more than him is me.

10:47.119 --> 10:49.986
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

10:50.522 --> 10:53.150
When he's not coming up with
a new way to tell me I am ugly...

10:53.258 --> 10:56.659
he's talking about how much money he's
going to make off of my disfigurement.

10:56.761 --> 11:00.322
You are not disfigured.
You are very pretty.

11:01.133 --> 11:03.431
Hank, tell her how pretty she is.

11:04.503 --> 11:08.837
Well, you've got beautiful eyes,
and a great figure, and you got...

11:08.940 --> 11:11.067
Thank you, Hank.
That's more than enough.

11:12.144 --> 11:13.839
Hi, everybody.

11:14.079 --> 11:17.981
Wow! Mrs. Gribble, you look terrible.

11:20.418 --> 11:23.012
Here. Try this new moisturizing cream.

11:23.421 --> 11:26.151
I use it on days when I don't look my best.

11:27.092 --> 11:28.753
It's not even opened.

11:33.865 --> 11:35.389
She sure looks tired.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.298
Yes. But still doable.

11:39.037 --> 11:42.438
If I am going to win this thing,
I've got to bump it up a notch.

11:44.809 --> 11:47.300
Nancy is highly allergic to lemon.

11:47.546 --> 11:49.878
- Bill, hand me a...
- Lemon?

11:50.248 --> 11:51.215
Yes.

11:59.658 --> 12:01.592
NANCY: Oh, my God!

12:03.862 --> 12:07.354
And as we move west toward El Paso,
watch out for high winds.

12:07.699 --> 12:11.396
So, ladies, if you've just done your hair,
you'd better beware.

12:13.205 --> 12:16.697
I just came to support Mrs. Gribble
and to give her some more make-ups.

12:16.908 --> 12:19.376
- You sabotaged my face!
- What?

12:19.678 --> 12:23.136
- Look at me!
- Good God.

12:24.783 --> 12:28.981
Now, Manitoba Cigarettes
have cost you your job, too?

12:29.120 --> 12:31.680
Tom the station manager said...

12:31.790 --> 12:35.191
he didn't want to see
my ugly face anymore!

12:35.493 --> 12:39.020
So, now nobody wants
to see your ugly face.

12:39.397 --> 12:42.093
That is it! I don't deserve this.

12:42.267 --> 12:46.465
You used to be a kind, loving man.
And now you are a foul-mouthed monster!

12:46.571 --> 12:49.472
- Yeah, yeah. Go on.
- Don't you touch me!

12:49.908 --> 12:52.206
It's over. I am leaving you.

12:58.016 --> 13:02.646
My horrifyingly grotesque wife
is leaving me because of my...

13:03.855 --> 13:05.345
smoking.

13:15.100 --> 13:18.797
Dale, I've tried real hard
to stay out of your relationship.

13:19.337 --> 13:23.637
But your relationship just moved
into my house and won't stop crying.

13:23.975 --> 13:27.138
Drop the suit and apologize
before it's too late.

13:27.245 --> 13:29.611
Man, you are a little-picture guy.

13:29.714 --> 13:32.274
Once I win and Nancy gets her face-lift...

13:32.384 --> 13:35.478
everything will be as smooth
as her new skin.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.990
[Singing] Beef-A-Roni's fun to eat

13:42.093 --> 13:44.027
Beef-A-Roni's really neat

13:44.129 --> 13:45.926
Beef-A-Roni's quite a treat

13:46.031 --> 13:47.396
- Hooray!
- Yippee!

13:47.499 --> 13:49.797
For Beef-A-Roni

13:50.568 --> 13:53.628
I can't take it anymore! Nancy's gone!

13:53.738 --> 13:56.730
She is gone and it's breaking my heart.

13:57.575 --> 14:00.908
- She's coming back.
- No. No, she's not!

14:01.012 --> 14:04.709
You are living a lie.
She's never coming back!

14:04.816 --> 14:08.047
They never ever do!
You think they will but they won't.

14:08.153 --> 14:11.748
Bill, you are scaring me.
Weren't we just having fun?

14:12.023 --> 14:15.015
Yes. Believe me,
I want you to get a divorce.

14:15.126 --> 14:17.686
That way you will be here all the time.

14:17.796 --> 14:20.856
Secretly, I was happy
your stupid plan backfired...

14:20.965 --> 14:25.026
so that I wouldn't be alone anymore,
but this isn't right.

14:25.370 --> 14:29.306
Go back to your wife! Here!
Take the money! And go, go on!

14:29.441 --> 14:31.671
Get back out the door
and get out of here! Get out!

14:39.451 --> 14:43.182
Hank, maybe I should talk to Nancy
for just a moment.

14:43.588 --> 14:46.489
She doesn't want to talk to you.
You broke her heart, Dale.

14:46.591 --> 14:48.821
Tell her I just want to tell her I am sorry...

14:48.927 --> 14:52.556
and if she will let me talk to her,
I will tell her myself. Tell her.

14:52.731 --> 14:56.189
I will do my best.
But it's not going to be an easy sell.

14:57.702 --> 15:00.398
HANK: Nancy?
NANCY: Make him go away.

15:01.339 --> 15:02.806
No sale.

15:11.616 --> 15:14.346
I need my Nancy!

15:17.255 --> 15:20.986
She won't talk to me.
What am I going to do?

15:24.829 --> 15:27.491
Wait. I know what I am going to do.

15:27.932 --> 15:30.400
All right, brain trust. The trial's tomorrow.

15:30.502 --> 15:32.163
Don't play patty cake with me.

15:32.504 --> 15:33.869
Could we lose this thing?

15:33.972 --> 15:36.372
We erased the tapes, so they can't hurt us.

15:36.474 --> 15:41.411
But the love affair between juries
and tobacco companies has cooled.

15:41.946 --> 15:43.846
Could we lose this thing?

15:50.588 --> 15:51.555
TOBLIK: Yes.

15:55.427 --> 15:58.919
- Are you Nancy Hicks Gribble?
- Yes.

16:01.099 --> 16:02.430
It's a subpoena.

16:02.534 --> 16:06.061
Now Dale is dragging me into court
to humiliate me publicly.

16:06.271 --> 16:08.796
I can't get involved. Good day, madam.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.711
It's a legitimate offer.
Why couldn't he just...

16:24.823 --> 16:27.917
- Mr. Gribble, I am Reynolds Penland.
- Wait.

16:28.426 --> 16:32.021
If you're here, who's that?

16:34.032 --> 16:36.592
Gribble, I am offering you
the deal of the century.

16:36.701 --> 16:38.362
$75,000.

16:39.170 --> 16:43.300
In return, we accept no liability
and you keep your mouth shut.

16:43.441 --> 16:45.636
You have no idea who you're up against...

16:45.743 --> 16:48.610
if you think I can begin
to keep my mouth shut.

16:49.147 --> 16:53.481
I don't want your chump change.
I am going for the big prize.

16:56.821 --> 17:00.655
Mr. Gribble, again I say this not only
as an officer of the court...

17:00.758 --> 17:02.487
but as a caring human being.

17:02.861 --> 17:05.159
Please do not represent yourself.

17:05.262 --> 17:07.753
May I continue?

17:08.199 --> 17:11.498
- Legally I cannot stop you.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

17:11.935 --> 17:16.099
Mr. Gribble, I hold in my hand...

17:16.674 --> 17:21.542
People Magazine's
Fifty Most Beautiful People issue.

17:21.846 --> 17:26.714
Are you familiar with
this Time Warner publication?

17:28.219 --> 17:29.186
No.

17:29.921 --> 17:32.583
May I remind you that you are under oath?

17:32.690 --> 17:35.056
And the subscription label
on this magazine...

17:35.159 --> 17:37.593
bears the name of your optometrist.

17:38.730 --> 17:40.163
I will ask you again.

17:40.331 --> 17:44.665
Are you familiar with
this Time Warner publication?

17:47.238 --> 17:48.637
Possibly.

17:48.940 --> 17:51.238
Objection. How is this relevant?

17:51.442 --> 17:53.467
Your Honor, I intend to establish...

17:53.578 --> 17:56.672
the witness's impossibly
high standard of beauty.

17:57.048 --> 17:58.310
I will allow it.

17:58.416 --> 18:02.546
But I want to see where this is going.
Sit still and get on with it.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.381
Thank you, Your Honor.

18:04.756 --> 18:08.487
Mr. Gribble, referring to Page 16...

18:08.593 --> 18:10.117
in this magazine...

18:10.228 --> 18:14.221
can you identify
the individual picture thereon?

18:16.534 --> 18:18.001
Jennifer Aniston.

18:18.369 --> 18:22.738
Do you or do you not find her beautiful?

18:24.442 --> 18:28.173
The really hot girl next door? Yeah.
Beautiful, no.

18:29.948 --> 18:33.748
Page 19, Denise Richards.

18:37.455 --> 18:41.152
I cannot get past her wretched acting
to see any beauty.

18:43.528 --> 18:47.794
Mira Sorvino, Mina Suvari, Chloe Sevigny?

18:48.833 --> 18:50.698
Speak English, please.

18:51.302 --> 18:53.532
Cindy Crawford? Mole!

18:53.771 --> 18:55.762
Very well then.

18:57.141 --> 18:58.972
Julia Roberts.

18:59.677 --> 19:02.202
"A horse is a horse, of course, of course."

19:02.380 --> 19:05.474
You are telling this court under oath...

19:05.583 --> 19:08.450
that you find none of
these women beautiful?

19:08.953 --> 19:11.854
Are you a homosexual?

19:12.523 --> 19:13.820
No!

19:14.525 --> 19:17.494
You cannot have it both ways, Mr. Gribble.

19:17.629 --> 19:20.564
Either you are a homosexual...

19:20.665 --> 19:24.567
or the most beautiful woman in the world
is in this magazine!

19:26.337 --> 19:30.330
The most beautiful woman in the world
is in this courtroom.

19:34.545 --> 19:37.878
Not you. The prettier woman next to you.

19:39.717 --> 19:42.413
Would the woman
in the sunglasses and hat...

19:42.520 --> 19:45.614
please remove her sunglasses and hat?

19:49.260 --> 19:51.353
Do you know this woman?

19:52.864 --> 19:56.095
She is my wife. She is my lover.

19:56.534 --> 20:01.130
She is the mother of my child.
She is my raison d'Ã©tre.

20:01.773 --> 20:04.640
But is she beautiful?

20:06.310 --> 20:08.437
Now where is he going with this?

20:09.313 --> 20:13.044
Your Honor, please direct
the witness to answer the question.

20:13.151 --> 20:16.382
Let me remind the witness
and his attorney...

20:16.521 --> 20:21.424
that the entire basis of his damage
claim rests upon his wife's appearance.

20:21.859 --> 20:24.157
One of you answer the question!

20:25.329 --> 20:28.924
She is the most beautiful woman
in the world to me.

20:29.767 --> 20:32.429
And I want her back more than anything.

20:33.371 --> 20:37.034
If anything, I owe Manitoba money
for the loveliness...

20:37.141 --> 20:40.804
my second-hand smoke
has bestowed upon my Nancy.

20:41.245 --> 20:45.682
She thinks she needs a face-lift.
But it couldn't be further from the truth.

20:45.883 --> 20:47.874
Your Honor, the defense moves
for dismissal!

20:47.985 --> 20:49.247
Case dismissed.

20:49.454 --> 20:53.220
Now, all of you,
get the hell out of my courtroom.

20:53.391 --> 20:55.325
I am so sorry, Nancy.

20:55.426 --> 20:57.724
I just wanted to make you
believe you were ugly...

20:57.829 --> 21:00.320
so if you testified you wouldn't have to lie.

21:01.833 --> 21:03.767
That's so romantic.

21:04.836 --> 21:08.966
It's romantic and cunning.
I am the whole package.

21:09.073 --> 21:10.938
Will you forgive me?

21:18.049 --> 21:20.517
Cock-a-doodle-doo, Heimlich County.

21:21.052 --> 21:23.543
Nothing but blue skies ahead.

21:23.654 --> 21:27.454
There, I signed your wife's new contract.
And I said I was sorry.

21:27.558 --> 21:28.855
Now, are you going to drop...

21:28.960 --> 21:31.019
that age-discrimination suit
against the station?

21:31.129 --> 21:34.929
Not so fast, Hollywood.
What's in it for me?

21:35.900 --> 21:37.527
What do you want?

21:38.002 --> 21:40.300
I don't know. I hadn't thought about it.

21:42.406 --> 21:43.805
File cabinet.

21:45.343 --> 21:46.742
Get him a file cabinet.

21:46.844 --> 21:49.472
I should have asked for a weather chopper.

21:50.081 --> 21:54.177
DALE: Weather chopper! And a file cabinet.

22:26.851 --> 22:28.614
LUANNE: Hug your babies tight.
