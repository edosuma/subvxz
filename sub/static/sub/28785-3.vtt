00:09.384 --> 00:11.094
<i>For all his ambitions,</i>

00:11.177 --> 00:12.595
<i>Frater J.P. is held back
by fear.</i>

00:12.679 --> 00:14.973
<i>Fear of loss, abandonment,
failure, love.</i>

00:15.056 --> 00:18.101
You want to remain in control,

00:18.184 --> 00:19.811
but you need
to let go.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.107
<i>You must keep a watchful eye</i>

00:24.190 --> 00:25.608
<i>on all those around you.</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:27.610
If you sense that anyone at all

00:27.694 --> 00:30.113
is not who they seem,
I want you

00:30.196 --> 00:32.073
to contact me here.

00:32.156 --> 00:36.286
Ask for M. Therion.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.329
<i>Aleister
Crowley's current whereabouts</i>

00:38.413 --> 00:40.623
<i>are unknown. We need to know
if he's still in touch</i>

00:40.707 --> 00:42.417
<i>with his pro-German
contacts in the U.S.</i>

00:42.500 --> 00:43.626
<i>and if they're
planning anything.</i>

00:43.710 --> 00:46.004
I already told you,
I don't know.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.590
Well, then I assume we can
count on you to pass along

00:48.673 --> 00:51.301
any information that
you do find out.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.303
<i>After a long journey,
Frater E.D.</i>

00:53.386 --> 00:55.638
<i>has returned with an
incredible revelation.</i>

00:55.722 --> 00:57.140
<i>He seeks the guidance</i>

00:57.223 --> 00:59.309
<i>of his Magus
and shall receive it.</i>

00:59.392 --> 01:01.436
I've missed you.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.646
<i>There are conditions.</i>

01:03.730 --> 01:05.815
It is the only thing
keeps my anger in check.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.150
<i>You want to remain.</i>

01:08.902 --> 01:11.946
<i>Susan is lost to me,
but Patty could still be saved.</i>

01:12.030 --> 01:14.365
<i>She's young and impressionabl.</i>

01:14.449 --> 01:16.910
I know it must be difficult
keeping up this lie,

01:16.993 --> 01:19.162
but you must
somehow persevere.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.289
You can start by

01:21.372 --> 01:23.500
<i>giving me the names
and personal details</i>

01:23.583 --> 01:25.168
<i>of everyone living there.</i>

01:25.251 --> 01:28.630
Is this the sort of information
you're looking for?

- Extra, extra! Read all about it!
- <i>Weihnachtsmann.</i>

02:11.464 --> 02:13.550
- So <i>schon.</i>
- Oh, dear. So <i>schon</i> indeed.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.718
Oh, y'all ain't lived
till y'all tried her crumble.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.762
It's all hot and gooey.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.597
Gonna be my contribution
to the Feast.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.392
- Wonderful.
- Got any Granny Smith?

02:22.475 --> 02:24.561
We'll just take three dozen
of these then, please.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.813
Would you like ones that
haven't been sullied?

02:26.896 --> 02:28.565
No,

02:28.648 --> 02:30.900
- these ones are fine.
- Extra, extra!

02:34.320 --> 02:35.905
Your eyes
shall be opened.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.909
And you shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.286
Mrs. Parsons,

02:41.369 --> 02:42.871
is that you?

02:42.954 --> 02:44.914
Mrs. Van Buren, hello.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.416
I'll pay for these.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.379
Oh, don't forget,
opera, 7:00.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.965
I won't forget.

02:54.048 --> 02:55.925
I am so glad
to have run into you.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.552
Did you receive my invitation?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.723
To the Preservation Society
Christmas soiree?

03:01.806 --> 03:05.643
Oh, yes, of course.
Um, when-when is it again?

03:05.727 --> 03:08.938
Tomorrow night, dear. I'm out
making final preparations.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.065
I do hope you and
your husband can make it.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.985
Oh, w-we'll do our best.
Jack's been consumed

03:14.068 --> 03:15.778
with his work for
the military these days.

03:15.862 --> 03:20.283
Ugh, well, I'm sure.
This war hangs over us all,

03:20.366 --> 03:22.994
and yet you all seem
to make time to host

03:23.077 --> 03:24.829
your fair share of gatherings.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.790
- Yes.
- From all appearances,

03:27.874 --> 03:30.793
they are quite lively,

03:30.877 --> 03:33.588
and yet no one from the
neighborhood has made the list.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.800
It's never good to get off
on the wrong foot, dear.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.428
Making an appearance
will go a long way

03:40.511 --> 03:42.472
in easing people's minds.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.768
- It's incredible.
- I know.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.145
Combining aniline
with the RFNA makes the fuel

03:49.228 --> 03:50.980
ten times more powerful.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.024
If von Braun had this mixture
in his V-2s,

03:53.107 --> 03:54.817
Hitler would be
pounding London by now.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.278
I'm more interested in when
we can start pounding Tokyo.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.697
I'm going out of my mind.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.659
All I did was to go ask
for his blessing,

04:02.742 --> 04:05.995
and now sh-she says that she
needs time to think things over.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.664
What the hell is there
to think over?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.165
And it's hypergolic.

04:09.248 --> 04:10.792
We're gonna save
at least five pounds

04:10.875 --> 04:12.293
by pulling the
ignition system.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.003
It's torture.
I mean, she's torturing me.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.507
Love is war, Richard. Don't let
Marisol get the upper hand.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.177
Can I have the ratios? I'll need
to get the chemicals sourced.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.346
Sure, I got all
my notes right...

04:23.429 --> 04:25.890
How can I win when
she won't even talk to me?

04:28.434 --> 04:30.520
What?

04:30.603 --> 04:32.689
Patty, can you have Private
Fischer bring in my notebook?

04:32.772 --> 04:34.941
I left it on my desk.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.988
Patty?

04:40.071 --> 04:42.907
Just rewrite the formula from
memory. It's not a big deal.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.742
It's a huge deal.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.912
The information in that
notebook is classified.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.372
You probably just
left it at home.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.332
We're all working too hard,
all the fucking time.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.043
No, I didn't.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.713
I was looking at it
this morning.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.256
Jack, come on.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.676
It doesn't make any sense.
It was in this room.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.183
We're not celebrating Christmas
at home this year.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.644
We're celebrating
Winter Solstice instead.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.271
- What's that?
- Well, it's this feast...

05:13.354 --> 05:15.189
Not something we should be
talking about at work.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.233
Did anyone come into my office
while I was out?

05:17.316 --> 05:18.401
I don't think so.

05:18.484 --> 05:21.029
You sit right outside my door.
It shouldn't be that hard.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.238
Well, if you haven't noticed,

05:22.322 --> 05:23.906
Alice and I have been
a bit busy today.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.284
It's not easy stringing
popcorn, Mr. Parsons.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.077
Do you like it?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.204
Who said you could
get a tree?

05:30.288 --> 05:32.081
I thought the place
could use some holiday cheer,

05:32.165 --> 05:34.751
so I followed
my true will.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.461
Jack, we need to get back to it.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.297
Prototype isn't going to
launch itself.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.549
Patty, stop what you're doing
and search every inch

05:41.632 --> 05:43.426
of this office
till you find my notebook.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.719
Okay?

05:47.346 --> 05:48.765
Thank you, Private Fischer.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.932
Gentlemen.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.608
Everything okay, Mr. Parsons?

07:21.899 --> 07:24.402
<i>Kanebgik.</i>

07:43.796 --> 07:46.340
Ernest? Ernest?

07:46.424 --> 07:47.717
No!

07:49.177 --> 07:50.720
Shh.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.183
You're okay.
It's just me.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.315
We use this at the hospital.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.944
When you come down too fast,
it can lead to dark thoughts.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.239
These'll give you just enough
light to pull you through.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.241
No, I'm confronting
my pain head-on,

08:12.325 --> 08:14.702
as the Magus instructed.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.371
But you don't have
to do it alone.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.415
I don't need it.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.259
The Magus would like to know if
your intention remains the same.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.929
You still wish
to see the angel?

08:34.472 --> 08:36.599
I have never wavered.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.059
Oh.

08:39.143 --> 08:42.230
Your will is more
potent than ever.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.941
But I fear that
you have lost touch

08:45.024 --> 08:48.986
with the most important
part of our faith... love.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.117
<i>Sofort!</i> American spy!

08:55.201 --> 08:57.787
<i>Informationen. Jetz.</i>

08:59.872 --> 09:00.957
<i>Jetzt!</i>

09:07.505 --> 09:09.924
You're speaking
of this man you work with?

09:10.007 --> 09:11.300
Why are you feeding
this infatuation

09:11.384 --> 09:13.803
if it could get you
into trouble?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.846
Because it's fun.

09:15.930 --> 09:19.809
Do you enjoy
toying with the forbidden?

09:19.892 --> 09:21.310
Doesn't everyone?

09:22.895 --> 09:24.188
<i>When we're alone,</i>

09:24.272 --> 09:26.274
<i>I want him so badly.</i>

09:26.357 --> 09:29.277
I just think about him
touching me, and I can feel

09:29.360 --> 09:32.154
<i>my heart beat faster,
like a drum.</i>

09:34.740 --> 09:37.243
I would do anything for him.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.872
<i>I would let him do anything
to me.</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:50.840
Might it have something
to do with your father?

09:50.923 --> 09:53.134
It's no wonder you would
associate sexual desire

09:53.217 --> 09:54.885
with the breaking of taboos.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.305
<i>I'm not going
to talk about this.</i>

09:57.388 --> 09:59.682
<i>Well, that's the reason
for these sessions... so you can</i>

09:59.765 --> 10:02.727
- <i>talk about things you normally keep hidden.</i>
- <i>Everyone else might be</i>

10:02.810 --> 10:06.856
stupid enough to reveal
that stuff, but I'm not.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.316
The last time

10:08.399 --> 10:10.067
I saw <i>Carmen</i> was

10:10.151 --> 10:12.737
at the Royal Opera House right
before it was requisitioned

10:12.820 --> 10:15.156
as a furniture repository
for the Great War.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.699
Hmm.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.035
Well, I'm afraid there were
a few useless footstools

10:19.118 --> 10:20.536
on that stage
tonight, as well.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.705
Pasadena has many virtues,

10:22.788 --> 10:25.583
but, uh, sopranos
are not one of them.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.419
Did it at least take
your mind off tomorrow's

10:28.502 --> 10:30.379
unfortunate obligation?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.881
A story about a
free-spirited gypsy

10:31.964 --> 10:33.716
being killed by a
wealthy lieutenant?

10:33.799 --> 10:36.761
Oh, come now.
It won't be that bad.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.179
It's just a Christmas party.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.889
Ah, correction.
Christmas soiree.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.682
Oh, how silly of me.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.060
Soiree.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.440
I should probably
head to bed.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.233
Jack's car was
in the driveway.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.277
So what if it was?

10:58.532 --> 11:00.910
Thank you for a
wonderful night.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.597
She keeps bringing
up this Christmas soiree.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.266
I really don't want
to go by myself.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.102
Then don't.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.895
We have to make
at least some effort

11:27.978 --> 11:30.606
- to get to know the neighbors.
- Why?

11:30.689 --> 11:33.275
Because they could make
our lives unpleasant.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.111
I grew up around these people.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.446
Believe me, their bark
is much worse than their bite.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.907
Jack, please?

11:39.990 --> 11:43.285
I can't make any promises.

11:43.369 --> 11:47.123
There have been some
troubling developments at work.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.958
What?

11:52.503 --> 11:54.296
I know how crazy
things have been,

11:54.380 --> 11:57.133
but it's nice for us to have
a moment alone together.

11:58.843 --> 12:02.972
One advantage of you having
to get up so early.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.141
What we're doing is
making me appreciate

12:05.224 --> 12:08.769
what we have all the more.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.272
How so?

12:11.355 --> 12:13.983
Choosing someone not
because you have to,

12:14.066 --> 12:15.609
but because you want to.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.572
Good morning.
I'll go get your tea.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.990
Oh, thank you.
I need it.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.576
Barely slept a wink
last night.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.996
Haunted by dreams
of <i>Carmen.</i>

12:27.079 --> 12:28.831
I take it you enjoyed the opera?

12:28.914 --> 12:30.499
Oh, not as much
as your wife.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.586
It's a shame
you had to work.

12:37.381 --> 12:41.886
You know, just because Susan and
I have chosen to love in freedom

12:41.969 --> 12:45.014
doesn't mean there won't be
consequences to our choices.

12:47.099 --> 12:51.729
And some choices will have
bigger consequences than others.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.650
Here you go.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.861
No sugar and just
a drop of lemon.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.822
- Bless you.
- I should go.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.866
See you tonight?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.576
We need to
leave by 7:00.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.829
I'll do my best to be there.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.180
I want to file a report about
a possible security breach.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.182
I'm listening, Mr. Parsons.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.559
Some notes went missing
from my office

13:30.643 --> 13:33.395
containing valuable information
about the project.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.690
And I have evidence
that Private Fischer

13:36.774 --> 13:39.235
was in my office
at the time they disappeared.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.861
That is a very serious
insinuation.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.364
If I file a report
and it has no merit,

13:43.447 --> 13:45.533
it could blow back onto you,
and you're the one

13:45.616 --> 13:47.701
- who lost the classified material.
- I didn't lose it, Wallace,

13:47.785 --> 13:49.203
it was stolen.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.581
Mr. Parsons,
I'm going to do us both a favor,

13:52.665 --> 13:55.209
and pretend we
never had this conversation.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.585
Wait, wait, wait.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.601
Hello. Huntington Hotel, please.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.894
- Thank you.
- See you later.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.021
Huntington Hotel.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.648
Hello, I'd like to leave
a message

14:17.731 --> 14:19.900
for the guest in room 156.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.111
Name, M. Therion.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.489
"Stop thinking and
follow me," cried Hitler.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.908
"I will make you masters
of the world."

14:27.992 --> 14:31.829
- And the people answered "Heil."
- Come. Act natural, boy.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.417
I could go over Wallace,
straight to Braxton.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.336
Based on a missing notebook
and a loose secretary?

14:39.420 --> 14:41.463
She's my sister-in-law.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.465
She is a whore.

14:43.549 --> 14:47.136
Every aspect of this story
reflects badly.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.138
You did well to come to me.

14:49.221 --> 14:53.851
However, the people
who I work for,

14:53.934 --> 14:55.644
they're going to
need more to go on.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.147
More? He might be
a goddamn spy.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.984
Why don't you broadcast it
to all of Los Angeles?

15:02.067 --> 15:04.111
The information
that was stolen from me

15:04.194 --> 15:05.863
might turn the tide of the war.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.656
A breakthrough
fuel mixture.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.866
It'd be catastrophic

15:08.949 --> 15:12.828
if it got into the wrong hands.

15:12.911 --> 15:14.455
Tell you what.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.999
Why don't you tell this
MP of your suspicion?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.001
If he really is a mole,
first thing he'll do

15:19.084 --> 15:20.669
is contact his handler.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.713
Then you follow him

15:22.796 --> 15:24.506
wherever that leads

15:24.590 --> 15:27.134
and you might be able to
ascertain who he's working for.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.970
Now, that's the sort
of information my associates

15:30.054 --> 15:31.889
can act upon.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.685
Who are these associates,
exactly?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.899
I do love a good
propaganda film.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.651
Everything is so
black and white.

15:43.734 --> 15:47.571
If only life were so simple.

15:50.908 --> 15:54.411
Suffice to say that I
am not alone in this.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.206
And you shouldn't be, either.

15:57.289 --> 16:02.544
We're both up against
a very dangerous enemy.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.175
They follow blindly the dictator

16:08.258 --> 16:12.054
and continue to chant the
hypnotic scream, "Sieg heil!"

16:12.137 --> 16:14.056
- Sieg heil!
- Sieg heil!

16:14.139 --> 16:15.849
- Sieg heil!
- Sieg heil!

16:29.655 --> 16:32.908
<i>Grobritannien?</i> Italy?

16:32.991 --> 16:35.285
<i>Marokko? Was hast du an al
diesen Orten gemach?</i>

16:35.369 --> 16:37.287
I'm not an American spy.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.373
- I was visiting those places.
- Why?

16:40.666 --> 16:41.875
To find the truth.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.628
<i>Bist du</i> OSS?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.588
Hey, <i>bist du?</i>

16:46.672 --> 16:47.923
<i>Bist du</i> MI6?

16:48.006 --> 16:49.258
Bist du <i>resistance?</i>

16:49.341 --> 16:50.300
Who are you?!

16:50.384 --> 16:52.302
I'm no one.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.597
- <i>Who are you?!</i>
- Ernest.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.892
Looks like you chopped enough
for the whole neighborhood.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.272
Thanks for keeping quiet about
what you saw the other night.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.275
We all think
the Magus serves us,

17:06.358 --> 17:08.652
but he'll take the thing
that brings you peace

17:08.736 --> 17:10.654
in the blink of a damn eye.

17:10.738 --> 17:14.575
Since you kept one secret,
I'm hoping you can keep another.

17:14.657 --> 17:18.287
- I think I've been infiltrated.
- By who?

17:18.369 --> 17:19.788
By the enemy.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.790
Which enemy?

17:21.874 --> 17:23.916
We're at war.
Take your pick.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.461
Could be the Japs.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.546
Most likely the Nazis.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.966
What do you need me to do?

17:32.384 --> 17:34.678
We did our best
to follow the specifications.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.473
Little hard without knowing
what the hell it is.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.516
Operating in the dark
is difficult,

17:39.600 --> 17:41.810
but such is the world
these days.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.605
Don't you need to talk
to Lieutenant Atencio

17:44.688 --> 17:47.691
about pulling
the ignition system?

17:47.775 --> 17:49.777
Jack's self-combusting
fuel, remember?

17:49.860 --> 17:50.986
Oh. Right.

17:51.069 --> 17:53.071
I can take you to him.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.366
You coming?

17:56.450 --> 17:58.619
I want to check
the regenerative cooling.

17:58.702 --> 18:01.413
See if we can shave
some weight there as well.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.052
Patty.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.054
Stop distracting
Private Fischer

18:17.137 --> 18:19.056
from his very
important work.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.474
I wasn't distracting him.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.976
He's got no one
to talk to back here.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.525
Is there something
I can help you with, sir?

18:29.608 --> 18:32.402
I think you left
this in my office.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.450
I'm on to you.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.928
Hey. What are you doing
with that thing?

18:58.011 --> 18:59.721
Sorry, that's classified.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.056
Who are you with?

19:01.139 --> 19:03.058
The Aerojet Corporation.

19:03.141 --> 19:04.434
Never heard of it.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.020
That's because
our work here is classified.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.273
Anyone tell you
to move, Nip?

19:09.356 --> 19:12.526
I thought you people were
supposed to report to the camps.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.613
I'm trying to get my wallet
and identification. I'm not...

19:16.697 --> 19:18.615
You'll move
when I say you move.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.284
What's going on here?

19:20.367 --> 19:22.536
Please explain to this man
that we are here

19:22.619 --> 19:24.955
on behalf
of the U.S. Army Air Force.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.290
Show him your credentials.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.009
As you can see,
I am a Chinese national

19:37.092 --> 19:40.262
and chief engineer
of a very real corporation.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.558
We're on high alert
for Jap spies.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.769
You can't expect normal
Americans to tell y'all apart.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.773
Certainly not Americans
with the IQs of chimpanzees.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.776
- You want to say that again?
- Nope, nope.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.528
It's fine.

19:58.780 --> 20:01.700
Gentlemen, we all need
to get back to work.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.122
Jesus.

20:07.205 --> 20:10.751
We've started acting
like the goddamn enemy.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.086
He was only
doing his job.

20:28.226 --> 20:29.645
Pull up over here.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.813
I don't think he saw us.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.616
I set the hook.
Let's see who reels him in.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.660
Thanks for coming with me.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.828
I would not want
to be doing this alone.

20:50.540 --> 20:54.378
Who the hell are you
meeting, Private Fischer?

21:40.465 --> 21:42.384
Come in.

21:42.467 --> 21:45.095
Looks like I've been stood up.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.222
Could you zip me up?

21:47.305 --> 21:49.599
I can't seem
to do it alone.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.279
I'm not looking
forward to this.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.281
You'll be fine.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.910
Well, if all else fails,
I'm bringing Jack's checkbook.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.747
I have a feeling he'll be
extra generous tonight,

22:11.830 --> 22:13.874
given his
last-minute absence.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.838
Do you have any plans
this evening?

22:21.590 --> 22:25.260
Just... study
and respite.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.265
Well, wish me luck.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.603
Thou shalt be learned
in the things of love,

22:34.686 --> 22:38.273
and mighty in the
things of war.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.847
Evening, ma'am.

23:17.521 --> 23:20.649
Mrs. Parsons,
we've been expecting you.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.991
Please,
help yourself to libations

23:30.075 --> 23:31.827
- and hors d'oeuvres.
- Thank you.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.915
Oh.

23:36.998 --> 23:41.378
Is that Susan Parsons?

23:55.433 --> 23:57.519
Is that Mrs. Parsons?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.569
Oh, good, you came.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.904
Ladies, look
who decided to join us.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.906
Where is your better half?

24:09.990 --> 24:11.867
Duty calls, I'm afraid.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.702
Oh, well,
that is unfortunate.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.453
Allow me to introduce
Susan Parsons.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.582
She and her husband are the new
occupants of the Fleming estate.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.125
- Mm.
- Parsons?

24:20.208 --> 24:22.043
As in Jack Parsons?

24:22.127 --> 24:24.212
I haven't seen him since
he was a child stealing fruit

24:24.296 --> 24:26.256
- from my trees.
- Well,

24:26.339 --> 24:29.384
he's a lot taller now but, uh,
still causing plenty of trouble.

24:29.467 --> 24:30.844
So we've heard.

24:30.927 --> 24:33.513
Uh, well,
lovely to meet you both.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.562
I'm sorry, sir.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.230
- This is a private function.
- Don't worry.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.899
I'm a guest of
Susan Parsons.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.734
Hello, dear!

24:45.817 --> 24:47.027
Oh, be-be a love.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.404
Fetch me a martini.

24:49.487 --> 24:51.698
I felt terrible

24:51.781 --> 24:54.075
leaving you to
fend for yourself.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.535
Allow me to introduce...

24:55.619 --> 24:57.078
Alfred Miller.

24:57.162 --> 25:00.415
Uh, i-is this meant
to be a Christmas costume?

25:00.498 --> 25:01.917
No, not in the slightest.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.920
Perhaps we should make our way

25:05.003 --> 25:07.589
into the library
so we can get started.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.674
Started?

25:10.675 --> 25:12.928
Thank you for coming.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.764
Though I might've chosen
something a little more subdued.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.141
We don't have to hide ourselves
from these people.

25:18.225 --> 25:21.269
Let them bask
in our splendor.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.980
Here's where the members
of the Preservation Society

25:24.064 --> 25:25.982
have decided
to ensconce themselves.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.275
Hello.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.902
Your drink, sir.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.946
Oh, thank you.
Good man.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.280
Chin-chin.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.116
Do I detect an accent?

25:35.200 --> 25:36.493
How perspicacious. Yes.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.578
Raised in Burma,
schooled in Cambridge.

25:38.662 --> 25:41.289
I take it you are
the leader of the group?

25:41.373 --> 25:43.124
Pardon?

25:43.208 --> 25:45.627
Well, you haven't
exactly tried to hide it.

25:45.710 --> 25:46.628
People coming
and going

25:46.711 --> 25:48.338
at all hours.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.840
What is it you all are doing,

25:50.924 --> 25:53.301
exactly?

25:53.385 --> 25:55.637
Whatever we will.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.639
It's a-a social club.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.474
A salon, really,

25:59.557 --> 26:03.103
of, uh, intellectuals,
artists,

26:03.186 --> 26:06.106
- freethinkers.
- Come now, Susan.

26:06.189 --> 26:09.234
Don't lie to these good people.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.445
What is he doing here?

26:12.529 --> 26:14.948
Mr. Byrne has become one
of the Preservation Society's

26:15.031 --> 26:16.992
most ardent supporters.

26:17.075 --> 26:17.993
We should go.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.787
No, you can't
keep running away.

26:20.870 --> 26:22.706
These people have
the right to know,

26:22.789 --> 26:24.708
they deserve to know
who is living next to them.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.293
I've heard the Parsons have

26:26.376 --> 26:28.670
at least ten people living
inside of that home,

26:28.753 --> 26:32.215
including
two Negro jazz musicians,

26:32.299 --> 26:33.842
multiple homosexuals
and deviants,

26:33.925 --> 26:36.052
even a German cross-dresser.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.679
Where... How did you get that information?

26:37.762 --> 26:38.722
What does it matter
where I got

26:38.805 --> 26:40.307
the information?
Is it true?

26:40.390 --> 26:43.143
Do you have all these tenants
living under your roof?

26:44.227 --> 26:46.271
Yes, they live with us,
but they're not tenants.

26:46.354 --> 26:48.690
- They don't pay rent.
- Well, they pay

26:48.773 --> 26:50.692
one way or another...
either with money

26:50.775 --> 26:51.901
or with flesh.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.945
Mrs. Parsons,
it sounds to me

26:54.029 --> 26:56.531
like you are running
an unlicensed boarding house,

26:56.614 --> 26:58.033
at the very least,

26:58.116 --> 27:01.703
not to mention violating
the restrictive covenant

27:01.786 --> 27:06.541
which prevents Negro occupants
in the Fleming estate

27:06.624 --> 27:08.001
unless they're the help.

27:08.084 --> 27:10.211
Are your Negroes
the help, Susan?

27:10.295 --> 27:11.713
Of course not.

27:11.796 --> 27:12.881
These are the
very sort of people

27:12.964 --> 27:16.009
that we have fought so hard
to keep out of our community.

27:16.092 --> 27:20.555
We need to make sure
that these tenants,

27:20.638 --> 27:22.682
or whatever you
want to call them,

27:22.766 --> 27:25.518
vacate your
house posthaste.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.688
Or else the zoning commission
will have no choice...

27:28.772 --> 27:30.565
Oh, enough!

27:30.648 --> 27:31.900
Oh, the charlatan speaks!

27:31.983 --> 27:34.903
I'm the-the charlatan?

27:34.986 --> 27:39.115
You are here
celebrating a holiday

27:39.199 --> 27:43.578
based on the greatest lie
ever told.

27:43.661 --> 27:47.374
Babies are not the result
of immaculate conception.

27:47.457 --> 27:51.127
They are the result of love.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.589
And love

27:54.672 --> 27:58.551
is the only law we obey.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.428
Perhaps, Mr. Miller.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.515
But you are in
Pasadena now.

28:03.598 --> 28:05.934
You must obey
our laws as well.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.936
Well, then, when you come
for us, you'd better bring more

28:08.019 --> 28:09.938
than the police
and your local covenants,

28:10.021 --> 28:11.439
because, truth is,

28:11.523 --> 28:13.817
we're not running
a boarding house.

28:13.900 --> 28:14.943
We are...

28:15.026 --> 28:17.112
a church.

28:17.195 --> 28:20.782
And, as such,
we are afforded full protection

28:20.865 --> 28:23.243
against this type of...

28:23.326 --> 28:25.829
religious persecution.

28:25.912 --> 28:30.959
You should know that both Patty
and I now practice Thelema

28:31.042 --> 28:33.795
in order to rid ourselves
of your sin.

28:33.878 --> 28:37.132
If you keep up
this crusade,

28:37.215 --> 28:40.844
we will find a way to
make you suffer for it.

29:04.075 --> 29:07.662
Maybe whoever he was supposed
to meet saw us and got spooked.

29:07.745 --> 29:10.457
You want to find out
the truth, don't you?

29:10.540 --> 29:11.666
I do, but...

29:13.376 --> 29:14.544
- The hell are you doing?
- People will admit

29:14.627 --> 29:16.546
anything when they're scared.

29:16.629 --> 29:17.714
Ernest.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.132
Ernest, no.

29:19.215 --> 29:21.050
Ernest.

29:31.269 --> 29:32.687
Who are you?

29:32.770 --> 29:34.314
Who the fuck are you?

29:34.397 --> 29:37.025
Tell me! Tell me!

29:37.108 --> 29:39.027
Who you working for?!

29:39.110 --> 29:40.111
Tell me!

29:40.195 --> 29:41.362
No one! I'm not!

29:44.324 --> 29:46.242
- Tell me.
- <i>Informationen.</i>

29:46.326 --> 29:48.077
- Omar...
- <i>Jetzt!</i>

29:49.162 --> 29:50.371
You choose.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.499
Talk or he dies.

29:52.582 --> 29:53.583
- Talk or die!
- I can't!

29:53.666 --> 29:55.376
They'd ruin me!

29:59.631 --> 30:00.882
What the fuck
are you doing?!

30:00.965 --> 30:03.218
I saw into his soul, Jack!

30:03.301 --> 30:05.053
He's a goddamn Nazi!

30:05.136 --> 30:06.554
Not a word
of this to anyone.

30:46.386 --> 30:49.556
I know I saw
it here somewhere.

30:49.639 --> 30:53.560
I saw it
just recently.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.981
I know
you're probably angry.

30:59.524 --> 31:02.277
So, I take it you
didn't enjoy the party?

31:02.360 --> 31:05.655
It wasn't a party at all.

31:05.738 --> 31:08.449
It was an inquisition.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.118
Fortunately,
the Magus came with me,

31:10.201 --> 31:11.953
so I didn't have
to face it alone.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.914
Didn't have to
face what alone?

31:14.998 --> 31:17.584
Virgil was there.

31:17.667 --> 31:20.962
He had detailed information
about everyone living here.

31:21.045 --> 31:22.463
How?

31:22.547 --> 31:24.340
God only knows.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.967
He uses P.I.s for his business.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.011
Maybe he's using them
against us.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.472
We need to build
our walls so high,

31:31.556 --> 31:34.183
he can't get at us anymore.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.311
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.313
Where were you?

31:38.396 --> 31:39.480
No. Let me guess.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.982
You can't say.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.443
No, but it was important.

31:43.526 --> 31:45.153
It always is.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.446
That's right.

31:46.529 --> 31:48.156
I'm fighting a war, Susan.

31:49.198 --> 31:52.493
So are we.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.997
If we can get the IRS to
recognize Thelema as a religion,

31:56.080 --> 31:58.666
officially, then our house
would become a church,

31:58.750 --> 32:00.001
like you said.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.002
We'd have
the full protection

32:01.085 --> 32:02.920
- of the First Amendment.
- Yes.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.466
It's been a long day.

32:06.549 --> 32:08.176
Go ahead without me.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.220
I'm not gonna be able
to sleep anytime soon.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.069
He claimed he was assaulted
and that you may have been

32:26.152 --> 32:26.944
a part of it.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.197
Did you take matters
into your own hands?

32:29.280 --> 32:30.865
You didn't leave me much choice.

32:30.948 --> 32:32.575
You think this man
was a spy?

32:32.659 --> 32:35.036
When he was confronted
about it, he didn't deny it.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.412
Actually,

32:36.496 --> 32:38.998
he seemed scared of what
his own people might do.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.500
If you don't
believe me, fine.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.001
Reassign him
wherever you want.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.836
But this is <i>my</i> company,

32:43.920 --> 32:45.380
and I don't want him here.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.882
I think what my colleague
is saying here is,

32:47.965 --> 32:51.511
whether or not Private Fischer
stole information from us,

32:51.594 --> 32:53.179
he crossed other lines.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.848
I get it. Pretty thing like that

32:55.932 --> 32:57.058
sitting right outside
your office.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.560
- Agent Wallace...
- Either you got possessive

32:59.644 --> 33:01.187
or you got jealous.

33:01.270 --> 33:03.064
- We're getting off track.
- Did anyone ask you?

33:04.816 --> 33:06.734
What is that you're wearing?

33:06.818 --> 33:10.196
Is that a Chinese
Nationalist flag?

33:10.279 --> 33:12.907
Is anyone
in this office on our side?!

33:12.990 --> 33:15.535
I am wearing it to avoid
being confused for the enemy.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.704
I don't have time
for this bullshit.

33:17.787 --> 33:20.581
We have real battles to fight.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.251
You will not be seeing
any more of Private Fischer.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.294
General Braxton...

33:25.378 --> 33:28.339
Whether or not these more
serious accusations are true,

33:28.423 --> 33:32.009
his dalliance with Mr. Parsons'
secretary was unbefitting.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.929
But whatever intel
was lost

33:35.012 --> 33:36.764
needs to be reported
to CIC.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.224
And, going forward,

33:38.307 --> 33:40.226
if you feel there may be
any sort of a breach,

33:40.309 --> 33:42.812
let Agent Wallace
and his department handle it.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.313
Am I clear?

33:44.397 --> 33:46.357
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

33:53.865 --> 33:57.660
My will is being tested.

33:57.744 --> 34:00.079
The devil we have fought
so hard against

34:00.163 --> 34:02.957
has gotten his claws
into Patty, too.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.251
They're claiming to be
a real religion.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.253
Can you imagine that?

34:07.336 --> 34:11.757
Every false prophet draws power
from somewhere.

34:11.841 --> 34:15.011
In this case, Mr. Parsons.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.804
He seems to be the cult's
lone benefactor.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.184
We need to move quickly if
I have any chance of saving Patty.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.647
What do you want me to do?

34:26.731 --> 34:30.318
Finish what we've started.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.820
You want more information?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.906
No.

34:36.532 --> 34:40.161
I want you to cut the head
off the snake.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.806
What are you doing?

34:59.889 --> 35:02.058
Taking my sensitive
materials home.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.310
They clearly
aren't safe here.

35:04.393 --> 35:06.354
Wallace wouldn't approve.

35:06.437 --> 35:09.232
Especially with all those
people at your house.

35:09.315 --> 35:11.984
I know everything
about <i>those</i> people.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.112
Here, even the ones they sent
to protect us can't be trusted.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.079
Ready to go?

35:23.162 --> 35:24.622
No. I'm going out with
some of the girls.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.040
What's the matter?
You steamed

35:26.123 --> 35:27.667
about me getting rid
of your boyfriend?

35:35.299 --> 35:37.051
He wasn't my boyfriend.

35:37.134 --> 35:39.554
Right. He was just
your forbidden tryst.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.223
You listened to my
purge session, didn't you?

35:42.306 --> 35:45.393
So what if I did?

35:45.476 --> 35:47.436
I'm the one who showed you
those recordings.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.022
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe I wanted you to hear?

35:52.108 --> 35:54.277
I wasn't talking
about Hank.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.695
You weren't?

35:55.778 --> 35:58.948
I had to do something
to get your attention.

35:59.031 --> 36:01.617
I was trying to manifest
my true will.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.120
We can't.

36:04.203 --> 36:06.414
We can do anything.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.708
Love is the law.

36:11.627 --> 36:13.087
This is not about love.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.422
Yes, it is.

36:14.505 --> 36:18.259
I've loved you since
I was a little girl.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.974
You're still a little girl.

36:36.569 --> 36:39.113
- Oh, Mr. Parsons.
- What?

36:39.196 --> 36:40.948
Someone left this by the
front door of the building.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.992
No return address
or anything.

36:43.075 --> 36:45.786
With all the restrictions going
on, I didn't want to open it.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.997
Thank you, Alice.

36:58.841 --> 37:01.302
I prepared for you duck,

37:01.385 --> 37:04.639
which was <i>meine Mutter's</i> recipe.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.515
She gave me my <i>mein</i> nose,

37:06.599 --> 37:10.019
<i>mein</i> tender heart,
before she broke it.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.312
Love is the law.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.814
Love under will.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.817
I made homemade muscadine wine.

37:16.901 --> 37:21.489
Wine so fine, mmm,
people ought to stand in line.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.325
It takes time.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.993
It costs a dime.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.828
Tell us what it means.

37:27.912 --> 37:31.832
Uh, I guess it's just
s-something my Uncle Dex made

37:31.916 --> 37:33.793
to make the day
go down easier.

37:33.876 --> 37:35.711
So he could feel the way
we feel all the time.

37:35.795 --> 37:38.130
Love is the law.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.007
Love under will.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.342
I made really,

37:41.425 --> 37:42.468
really burnt bread.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.805
Sorry, guys.

37:45.888 --> 37:47.181
I made deviled eggs.

37:47.264 --> 37:49.308
My mom and I used to make them
in the kitchen.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.185
It was the only time "devil"
was allowed in our house.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.939
Devil was a crazy man.
Love is the law.

37:55.022 --> 37:56.065
Love under will.

37:57.733 --> 38:01.195
I made
chocolate-covered cherries.

38:01.278 --> 38:02.405
Uh, my mother...

38:09.078 --> 38:12.540
My dear, it is mandatory

38:12.623 --> 38:15.584
to have fun on the solstice.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.713
I have other things
on my mind.

38:18.796 --> 38:22.800
Like fortifying ourselves
against our enemies?

38:22.883 --> 38:25.678
These tax laws
we're using...

38:27.471 --> 38:30.224
...they were written by men
in power for men like him.

38:30.307 --> 38:32.601
Mm, perhaps.

38:32.685 --> 38:37.398
But we have something even
more powerful on our side.

38:40.985 --> 38:44.238
Magick.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.657
At ease, soldier.

39:28.741 --> 39:30.993
Parsons had nothing
to back up his claims.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.661
His friend almost killed me.

39:32.745 --> 39:35.623
You do understand why
I couldn't intervene, right?

39:35.706 --> 39:38.125
The whole operation
would've been exposed.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.544
Do you have it?

39:51.222 --> 39:53.099
You're being transferred
to Huntsville.

39:53.182 --> 39:54.809
Redstone Arsenal.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.477
Alabama?

39:56.560 --> 39:58.479
Might not seem like
much of a posting now,

39:58.562 --> 40:01.857
but, trust me, it will be.

40:11.534 --> 40:14.078
Ernest?

40:14.161 --> 40:16.497
Did you take my notebook?

40:16.580 --> 40:18.624
It's not about
your fucking notebook.

40:18.707 --> 40:21.001
Powerful forces
keep pushing us together.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.004
The universe must want us
to collide.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.507
What are you talking about?

40:26.590 --> 40:28.551
Time to make an offering, Jack,

40:28.634 --> 40:31.011
so I can be free
to see my angel.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.348
See, I've been where
you are before,

40:34.431 --> 40:36.684
except they didn't give me
a choice.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.853
What do I have to choose,
Ernest?

40:38.936 --> 40:41.689
Who lives and who dies.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.859
You choose. Talk or he dies.

40:44.942 --> 40:47.862
Why does somebody have to die?

40:47.945 --> 40:50.322
'Cause the angel demands blood.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.825
No, no, no, no, no spies...

40:53.951 --> 40:55.536
<i>Amor. Amor.</i>

40:55.619 --> 40:56.871
What? <i>Amor?</i>

40:56.954 --> 40:59.248
<i>Amor.</i>

40:59.331 --> 41:01.125
Love.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.549
Love?

41:08.632 --> 41:10.092
<i>Arschficker?</i>

41:11.427 --> 41:14.054
<i>Arschficker.</i>

41:20.019 --> 41:21.270
No!

41:23.647 --> 41:26.901
That's what happened right
before he appeared to me.

41:26.984 --> 41:29.612
A great sacrifice.

41:29.695 --> 41:33.115
So whose is it gonna be,
yours or mine?

41:33.199 --> 41:35.659
This is insane.

41:35.743 --> 41:38.495
"And he shall cast
lots upon two goats,

41:38.579 --> 41:40.080
"and one lot shall go
to the Lord

41:40.164 --> 41:42.208
and one lot shall go to Azazel."

41:42.291 --> 41:44.335
I'm not gonna fucking kill you,
Ernest.

41:44.418 --> 41:45.753
Then you made your choice.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.421
No. Don't-don't do this.

41:47.504 --> 41:48.756
Ernest, don't do this.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.424
I brought you
into my house.

41:50.507 --> 41:51.800
I forgave you.

41:51.884 --> 41:54.803
Yours is not
the forgiveness I need.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.665
Tighter.

42:25.167 --> 42:28.128
Tell me what you want.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.214
To vanquish my enemies.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.093
Just you and me, Jack.

42:34.176 --> 42:37.638
You can't do this!
I'm your elemental!

42:37.721 --> 42:40.266
No, I found my elemental
nearly halfway around the world.

42:40.349 --> 42:41.892
The Fascists took him from me.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.854
Now I have to cut the
head off the snake.

43:16.635 --> 43:19.471
Tell me what you want.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.851
To vanquish my enemies.

44:20.616 --> 44:25.120
Thee I invoke, the Bornless one.

44:25.204 --> 44:28.540
Thee that didst create the Earth

44:28.624 --> 44:29.875
and the Heavens.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.091
I am He!

44:37.174 --> 44:40.260
The Bornless Spirit!

44:40.344 --> 44:41.887
I am He!

44:41.970 --> 44:43.972
The Truth!
