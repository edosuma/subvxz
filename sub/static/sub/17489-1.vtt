01:44.604 --> 01:48.575
<i>President Reagan today officially
announced the Space Defense Program.</i>

01:48.675 --> 01:51.644
<i>The Strategic Defense initiative
is officially started</i>

01:51.744 --> 01:55.126
<i>against the ballistic missiles
armed with nuclear warheads.</i>

02:03.156 --> 02:05.125
Are you okay?

02:05.225 --> 02:06.827
Of course.

02:09.294 --> 02:12.332
- The night's beautiful.
- Told you so.

02:12.432 --> 02:15.168
Only the best for my girl.
Isn't that right, guys?

02:15.268 --> 02:17.637
Woo, woo, woo, Wolf pack!

02:17.737 --> 02:22.308
If we keep up the effort like this,
then I can get a scholarship easy!

02:22.408 --> 02:24.577
Then there's no stopping
till I turn pro.

02:24.677 --> 02:27.714
- You know what that means?
- That you can be a pro?

02:27.814 --> 02:31.384
Yeah, damn fuckin' right
I can be a pro athlete.

02:31.484 --> 02:35.688
Fame, money, women.

02:35.788 --> 02:38.958
And all the booze and weed
we can get our hands on!

02:39.058 --> 02:42.662
Woo, woo, woo, Wolf pack!

02:43.062 --> 02:45.507
I'm happy that makes you happy,

02:45.908 --> 02:48.735
but I have to go.
I said I'd be back by 9:00.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.572
Don't be a party pooper, babe.
You ain't a kid anymore.

02:52.673 --> 02:56.376
You're a big girl. Your dad
needs to understand that.

02:56.476 --> 03:00.580
He's bugging you, 'cause you're
the only one he's got power over.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.651
He thinks he can tell you where
to go and who to go with,

03:04.751 --> 03:09.622
but for Christ's sakes, the bastard
doesn't even have a job. He's a zero!

03:10.222 --> 03:13.126
- It's not his fault.
- Yeah, right.

03:13.226 --> 03:16.563
Biff, how about we get everybody
together and go up to my place?

03:16.663 --> 03:21.034
My parents are gone to San Diego for
the weekend. The whole house is ours.

03:21.134 --> 03:24.465
Your parents are probably fixing their
marriage with some sex in the zoo,

03:24.566 --> 03:28.641
banging in the water park, checking
out the kangaroos, how they do it.

03:28.741 --> 03:33.079
- Fucking funny, McNeal.
- I think it is. How about you, babe?

03:33.179 --> 03:34.724
Is it funny?

03:39.451 --> 03:41.826
Hey, Tully! Why in such a hurry?

03:43.923 --> 03:47.360
Mommy probably slept with someone again,
but she didn't leave the key.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.800
He cannot go home!

03:49.796 --> 03:55.969
Tully! Wouldn't you like to join us?
It's time to start acting like a man!

03:56.069 --> 04:00.206
All the girls are beautiful
over here, and the moonlight,

04:00.306 --> 04:03.510
and the best football
team in the world!

04:03.610 --> 04:04.677
Yeah, yeah!

04:04.777 --> 04:08.819
If you spend only five minutes with us,
your balls will drop for sure!

04:10.683 --> 04:14.888
How about we forgive each
other for what we did

04:14.988 --> 04:17.757
and become friends?

04:17.857 --> 04:19.358
I never did anything to you.

04:20.259 --> 04:23.897
Of course you didn't!
Of course you didn't.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.167
But you know what, Tully?

04:27.267 --> 04:30.737
This... was the part
of the initiation!

04:31.237 --> 04:33.907
Now you're one of us.
Did you know that?

04:34.007 --> 04:36.409
Now you're a member of the Wolf pack!

04:36.509 --> 04:41.414
You're a wolf! The most
dangerous animal in the forest!

04:41.514 --> 04:43.216
Woo, woo, Wolf pack!

04:43.316 --> 04:46.152
- Jenny? Tell him.
- Biff, leave him alone!

04:46.252 --> 04:48.788
Jenny thinks the same too! Girls?

04:48.888 --> 04:52.926
- We love you, Tully!
- Do you hear that?

04:53.026 --> 04:59.272
Hey, Earth calling Sam!
Lose the bike and join us.

05:10.808 --> 05:12.688
City lights.

05:15.414 --> 05:17.617
Stars.

05:18.517 --> 05:21.254
Beautiful, isn't it?

05:21.554 --> 05:23.590
Yeah, it is.

05:23.690 --> 05:27.670
Do you know what's more
beautiful than this?

05:31.064 --> 05:35.002
Pussy! And I know that's
what you want, Sammy boy!

05:36.369 --> 05:38.638
That is what you want.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.773
A girl, right?

05:40.873 --> 05:45.378
Rather than those nicely cut
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

05:45.478 --> 05:48.047
as your best friends during breaks!

05:48.147 --> 05:50.416
Ain't that right?

05:50.516 --> 05:54.287
- I gotta go, guys.
- Of course you should, of course.

05:54.387 --> 05:57.023
But I know something

05:57.123 --> 06:00.627
much more interesting.

06:00.727 --> 06:03.396
Something that would make you feel

06:03.496 --> 06:08.001
like a real fucking man!

06:08.101 --> 06:11.938
- A trial, if you wish.
- Biff, leave him alone!

06:12.038 --> 06:14.874
That was enough! You're not funny!

06:14.974 --> 06:19.612
Do you see, Sam?
She is such a good girl.

06:19.712 --> 06:24.484
She tries to protect everyone
and does everything for you.

06:24.584 --> 06:29.528
Whatever you like.
And I mean everything!

06:30.490 --> 06:32.035
You know what I mean?

06:33.459 --> 06:37.930
So how about it, Tully?
Would you like her?

06:38.030 --> 06:40.066
You would like the girl,
ain't that right?

06:40.166 --> 06:42.979
You're an asshole, Biff!
Take me home now!

06:44.137 --> 06:45.972
Now, you listen to me, Tully.

06:46.072 --> 06:51.277
What would you do for
a kiss from my babe?

06:51.377 --> 06:55.281
- From my sexy Jenny?
- Go to hell!

06:55.381 --> 06:59.019
What would you give for that?

06:59.519 --> 07:03.196
I... I've really got to
go home now, I'm sorry.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.632
He should go to the
old amusement park

07:12.732 --> 07:17.240
and come back with some kind
of evidence like, some corpses.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.340
- Would you do it?
- Tully, yes!

07:20.440 --> 07:23.042
Would you go in the
old amusement park?

07:23.142 --> 07:25.745
Is our little Jenny
worth that much to you?

07:25.845 --> 07:29.315
You're out of your mind! If you
don't take me home right now,

07:29.415 --> 07:31.784
I'm gonna walk.
But I'm not going alone.

07:31.884 --> 07:34.555
- Come on, Sam, let's go!
- Tully!

07:35.621 --> 07:39.396
Just look at this body.

07:41.093 --> 07:43.830
Wouldn't it be worth it?

07:43.930 --> 07:46.121
Biff, that is not a funny joke.
That's enough!

07:46.222 --> 07:51.204
Shut the fuck up, Lou!
Who said that I'm joking?

07:51.404 --> 07:55.475
So, Tully, would it
be worth it to you?

07:55.575 --> 07:57.443
Yes or no?

07:57.543 --> 08:02.148
And I only want to hear one word.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.550
Yes! Tully, yes!

08:04.650 --> 08:07.987
- Tully, yes!
- Tully, Tully, Tully!

08:08.087 --> 08:09.389
- I...
- So?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.659
I...

08:12.391 --> 08:13.793
All right, I'll do it!

08:14.393 --> 08:16.863
You know what, big boy?

08:17.363 --> 08:21.100
Biff. That might not be such a good idea.
You know that place is not cool.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.373
Did you shit yourself?
Are you fucking chicken?

08:27.106 --> 08:30.543
Of course not, you idiot! Only my dad's
gonna kill me if he finds out I was there.

08:30.643 --> 08:34.113
I only know one thing,

08:34.212 --> 08:37.150
and that's Tully is gonna
show us all tonight

08:37.250 --> 08:40.229
that he has real balls!

08:41.187 --> 08:42.488
Gentlemen!

08:42.587 --> 08:47.326
Let's... broaden our minds!

08:47.426 --> 08:51.297
- To the park!
- To the park!

08:51.597 --> 08:53.499
The coach awaits, my lady.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.403
Come on, babe!

08:57.503 --> 09:00.812
Westlake is pretty far from here.
I'll take you home.

09:14.453 --> 09:18.057
And now, let's drink to Tully!

09:18.157 --> 09:22.228
Our new hero who's gonna
show us poor dogs

09:22.328 --> 09:25.064
what true love really means.

09:25.164 --> 09:27.867
Tully, Tully!

09:27.967 --> 09:29.936
Tully, Tully, Tully!

09:30.036 --> 09:32.377
Are you ready Tully?

09:39.011 --> 09:41.216
You don't have to do this, Sam.

09:45.184 --> 09:46.820
I'm ready.

09:48.888 --> 09:51.294
I love this kid!

09:52.258 --> 09:56.696
It's time, buddy. Right now it's...

09:57.296 --> 09:58.732
10:00.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.043
- So...
- Tully, Tully!

10:05.438 --> 10:08.407
Five minutes...

10:08.507 --> 10:11.349
past midnight.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.116
So, five minutes after midnight,

10:17.216 --> 10:21.053
you should come out and
bring something with you.

10:21.753 --> 10:23.956
Something scary.

10:24.556 --> 10:28.327
My old man told me no one's set
foot on these grounds since 1928.

10:28.427 --> 10:31.898
- It was like Black Friday or something.
- So that's why you are so smart.

10:31.998 --> 10:35.334
Family heritage or,
you know, something.

10:35.434 --> 10:38.189
Fuck off, jerry! I'm serious!
They reopened it in the '60s,

10:38.290 --> 10:42.152
but they had another accident. Like 50
people died, so they closed it down again.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.814
The clock is ticking, man.

10:49.248 --> 10:52.351
- Tully boy!
- Woo, woo, woo!

10:52.451 --> 10:56.155
- Tully boy!
- Woo!

10:56.255 --> 10:59.992
And don't forget, Tully!
Bring me something nice!

11:00.092 --> 11:01.535
Something nice, I said!

11:03.429 --> 11:05.531
We won't see him again.

11:10.603 --> 11:14.174
- We should really go now, guys.
- Not on my watch.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.776
- What, you want to wait until midnight?
- Of course.

11:16.876 --> 11:20.480
The little prick will
bring me a gift.

11:21.580 --> 11:26.285
Isn't that right, kitty cat? What a
man wouldn't do for a real woman.

11:26.385 --> 11:30.490
Go to hell, Biff!
You can all go to hell!

11:30.990 --> 11:35.227
What's wrong, babe? Maybe you'd
like to go in with the little moron.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.797
You know what?
You don't know anything!

11:37.897 --> 11:40.600
And none of your idiot friends do!

11:40.700 --> 11:45.312
And if anyone is a complete moron
in this place, it would only be you!

12:09.762 --> 12:13.570
Stupid Biff. Stupid friends. Stupid.

14:11.216 --> 14:15.488
- Sam!
- Jenny, what are you doing here?

14:15.588 --> 14:19.325
I came in after you. It was
silly of you to come in here.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.828
Biff and the others
are complete idiots.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.530
- You shouldn't be here at all.
- Jenny!

14:24.630 --> 14:28.024
I appreciate you doing this for me,
but this whole thing...

14:28.125 --> 14:31.370
their stupid game,
Biff's stupid game...

14:31.470 --> 14:34.006
- Jen!
- Oh, when he's drunk...

14:35.106 --> 14:37.577
oh, it's complicated,

14:38.077 --> 14:41.090
but I don't want you to
do this just 'cause of me.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.648
- What the hell was that?
- I have no idea.

16:22.748 --> 16:27.353
Something weird,
like eastern magic and freaks.

16:27.453 --> 16:31.424
But whatever it is, I'm pretty sure
that now everyone knows we're here.

16:35.427 --> 16:39.671
The "Sea of Love."
There might be someone there.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.913
- What? What are you waiting for?
- I just hate spiders.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.556
- Sam?
- Jenny.

17:05.356 --> 17:08.194
Sam, I think that
someone's in that boat.

17:10.095 --> 17:14.199
And he's watching me. Hey, sir?

17:14.299 --> 17:17.505
- Jenny, don't get any closer!
- Sir?

17:23.409 --> 17:26.220
Biff! Not funny!

17:28.213 --> 17:30.088
Stop this stupid game!

17:33.752 --> 17:38.096
- Stop it right now!
- Jen, this isn't a good idea.

18:15.994 --> 18:18.404
Look, the boat is empty.

18:23.635 --> 18:25.943
Look, I can see a way out!

18:39.084 --> 18:41.926
This really isn't the Sea of Love.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.793
Do you hear that?

18:47.893 --> 18:50.564
- What?
- That noise.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.240
It's coming from over there!

19:23.561 --> 19:25.931
Something is really messed
up about this place.

19:26.031 --> 19:28.033
- What?
- We've got to get away from here!

19:28.133 --> 19:30.970
- I can't hear you! I can't hear anything!
- We got to get out of here!

19:33.905 --> 19:35.341
Jenny!

19:38.744 --> 19:41.980
Welcome to my fairy tale.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.818
Let's get this party started!

19:45.918 --> 19:49.388
Feel free to call me
something like this:

19:49.488 --> 19:54.260
Clown... Clowney... Mr. Clown.

19:54.360 --> 19:58.030
But never, never call me Dorothy!

19:58.230 --> 20:01.235
I hate that fuckin' name!

20:05.771 --> 20:07.739
This... this...

20:07.839 --> 20:11.043
Sam, I'm scared... please.

20:11.143 --> 20:15.489
And I thought school was bad.
That thing was not human!

20:49.314 --> 20:53.252
A teeny tiny mouse

20:53.352 --> 20:56.955
sneaked into my house.

20:57.055 --> 21:01.193
He wants to find some cheese

21:01.293 --> 21:05.030
or some juicy freshy peas,

21:05.130 --> 21:09.334
but finally what he found

21:09.434 --> 21:12.674
buries him into the ground.

21:13.772 --> 21:17.718
My rhymes are probably crap.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.918
But you walked into my trap.

21:49.574 --> 21:52.981
Did you see that thing?
It looked like a clown.

21:58.684 --> 22:01.887
Clown or not, that's what we saw.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.423
I've had enough of the
lights turning on and off.

22:05.523 --> 22:10.996
- Look! We'll go inside and call for help.
- Do you think the phone still works?

22:11.096 --> 22:14.499
I'm calling my dad, and then
I'm gonna call the police.

22:14.599 --> 22:16.702
And then I'm gonna
grab Biff Russell's head

22:16.802 --> 22:20.481
and beat it against the side of
his stupid car until I feel better.

22:29.581 --> 22:31.121
What?

23:02.147 --> 23:05.994
Sam. Can I ask you something?

23:09.087 --> 23:14.326
What's in your bag? You've had
it ever since we got in here.

23:14.626 --> 23:18.496
And you're holding on to it
like your life depends on it.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.910
This... it's just a backpack.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.212
I see.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.580
Just a backpack, huh?

23:40.952 --> 23:42.588
These...

23:43.321 --> 23:46.325
These are important things to me.

23:46.425 --> 23:51.401
Like this comic book. I've read it
like a hundred times already...

23:52.564 --> 23:55.901
because in comic books,
anything can happen.

23:56.001 --> 23:59.504
The good guy always wins

23:59.604 --> 24:02.812
and... anything is possible.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.289
And it's so... it's so colorful.

24:08.413 --> 24:09.514
I...

24:11.016 --> 24:15.821
I just carry the bag because I'm afraid
that if I put it down somewhere,

24:15.921 --> 24:18.963
it'll get lost and I'll lose
all the things that I love.

24:22.260 --> 24:27.382
Of course, it's just a comic
book and... and some crap, but...

24:27.483 --> 24:31.670
somehow, that's me.
My whole life's in this.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.876
You're saying your
whole life is in this bag?

24:36.708 --> 24:38.314
Maybe.

24:44.649 --> 24:48.694
I'm gonna go and take a look
over there. There might be an exit.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.570
Well, hello.

24:55.894 --> 24:58.196
Did you say something?

24:58.296 --> 25:01.199
Not a single word.

25:01.299 --> 25:03.535
A little bit to the right.

25:04.335 --> 25:06.910
Right. Lower.

25:08.006 --> 25:12.014
It's a rare moment to find such
a beautiful couple around here.

25:13.311 --> 25:15.881
This has got to be a bad dream.

25:15.981 --> 25:19.756
Compared to what awaits
you here, this is really nothing.

25:23.321 --> 25:24.594
What...

25:25.891 --> 25:26.958
What are you?

25:27.058 --> 25:31.830
I'm a teakettle, asshole!
What'd you think? Marilyn Monroe?

25:31.930 --> 25:35.867
What is this place? And are you the
one that keeps playing with the lights?

25:37.167 --> 25:41.973
Are you a fucking retard or what?
As I said, I'm a fucking teakettle,

25:42.073 --> 25:45.243
not a stupid lamplighter from
"The Little Prince"!

25:45.343 --> 25:49.481
What is this place, you ask? Well, honey,
this place is your worst nightmare,

25:49.581 --> 25:51.883
the hell of those who
were expelled from hell,

25:51.983 --> 25:55.754
the rollercoaster of death,
the asshole of Cerberus

25:55.854 --> 25:59.157
- or at least something very similar.
- Sam, let's get the hell out of here!

25:59.457 --> 26:03.605
Would you just shut your dirty, diseased
traps? You're driving me fucking nuts!

26:10.301 --> 26:13.505
Hey, Biff! Aren't you
going after your girl?

26:14.105 --> 26:17.509
They might be riding the
merry-go-around together

26:17.609 --> 26:19.454
or, you know, something else.

26:20.445 --> 26:25.317
Shut the fuck up, Jerry!
This is not funny.

26:25.617 --> 26:29.659
The little whore called me a moron!

26:32.991 --> 26:37.232
The little whore called me a moron...

26:38.163 --> 26:42.143
and she kicked a dent in my car!

26:43.101 --> 26:46.072
My beautiful fucking car!

27:13.932 --> 27:15.634
Now what?

27:15.934 --> 27:20.438
Well, if we don't go out at midnight, maybe
Biff and the others will come in after us.

27:20.538 --> 27:23.141
What? Biff, the knight
in shining armor?

27:24.743 --> 27:29.114
Look, I'm really sorry you
have to deal with this.

27:29.414 --> 27:33.663
It's my fault.
You're here because of me.

27:34.786 --> 27:36.631
Biff and...

27:39.657 --> 27:43.512
I hate Biff. He's a selfish,
arrogant, bullying,

27:43.613 --> 27:47.567
dumb, envious, cocky egomaniac.

27:49.067 --> 27:52.370
- Are you hearing this, too?
- Yeah, there's music.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.973
Maybe there is someone
here who can help!

27:55.073 --> 27:57.709
Maybe it's whoever is
playing with the lights.

27:57.809 --> 28:01.728
Or another talking creature.
Like a talking clock,

28:01.829 --> 28:05.856
or a reindeer...
or maybe it's the clown.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.024
Maybe.

28:09.521 --> 28:13.625
So this is where you want to wait for my
selfish, dumb, bullying, arrogant, envious,

28:13.726 --> 28:16.528
- cocky... did I miss something?
- Egomaniac.

28:16.628 --> 28:20.665
Yeah. So this is where you want to wait
for my selfish, egomaniac ex-boyfriend

28:20.765 --> 28:24.035
and his stupid friends, or are we
going to get the hell out of here?

28:24.135 --> 28:26.271
A dickhead. That's what I left out.

28:26.371 --> 28:30.148
A major dickhead.
Captain of the dickheads.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.945
Wait a minute.

28:34.045 --> 28:37.049
What did you say? Your...

28:37.149 --> 28:39.785
your ex-boyfriend?

28:40.385 --> 28:42.153
Yeah.

28:42.253 --> 28:45.495
I'm not dating a selfish,
egomaniac guy.

28:46.691 --> 28:49.260
I... I...

28:49.360 --> 28:53.865
Oh, I don't know if you've noticed,
but it stinks like a skunk in here.

28:54.165 --> 28:55.870
Biff's been here before.

28:59.337 --> 29:02.574
Oh, the stench is awful.

29:03.174 --> 29:06.544
Let's move on. I could throw up!

29:27.065 --> 29:32.437
Fuck me! This piece
of shit is stuck again!

29:32.537 --> 29:36.341
Dennis! Dennis!

29:36.441 --> 29:39.750
Are you sitting on your fucking ears?

29:42.613 --> 29:44.616
What took you so long?

29:44.716 --> 29:47.185
I was putting the clothes out to dry.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.522
Fucking funny.
You don't even have hands.

29:50.622 --> 29:54.793
It could be that I'm lying, then.
What do you want, wormface?

29:54.893 --> 29:58.797
This shitty gramophone
is busted again.

29:58.897 --> 30:02.067
No, don't give me
that surprised look.

30:02.167 --> 30:03.468
It was expected.

30:03.568 --> 30:06.705
I don't know why we
have to dick around

30:06.805 --> 30:10.108
with these old pieces of shit.

30:10.208 --> 30:13.144
Why can't we use something...

30:13.244 --> 30:15.680
modern stuff?

30:15.780 --> 30:17.882
I'm sick of these gothic losers.

30:17.982 --> 30:22.387
I mean, why don't we modernize?

30:22.487 --> 30:24.956
Why do we have to do

30:25.056 --> 30:29.027
the same old crap for 500 years?

30:29.127 --> 30:32.197
Sure, sure, I understand...

30:32.297 --> 30:35.567
tradition and all that boring shit.

30:35.667 --> 30:39.404
But this is not the fucking
Buckingham Palace!

30:39.504 --> 30:42.340
And I am not the royal family!

30:42.440 --> 30:46.811
Or is that how I look like to you?
Seriously now, Dennis.

30:46.911 --> 30:50.548
Do I look like a fucking prince?

30:50.648 --> 30:52.150
Are you finished?

30:52.250 --> 30:55.954
- I'm gonna go look at the gramophone.
- Just getting started!

30:56.054 --> 31:01.392
I am absolutely en-ra-ged!

31:01.492 --> 31:03.695
Sometimes I would just like to say

31:03.795 --> 31:08.066
the boss is a cheap bastard.

31:08.166 --> 31:11.336
He has no balls to change anything.

31:11.436 --> 31:15.073
Suck my balls, Drew.
You won't drag me into this crap.

31:15.173 --> 31:20.078
If you want to modernize so much, you could
really just change music once in a while.

31:20.178 --> 31:23.682
It's just that it would be
nice to hear something else.

31:23.782 --> 31:26.317
Johnny Cash or Bowie.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.386
Bowie my ass!

31:28.686 --> 31:33.731
That guy is giving me the willies.
What does that man look like?

31:34.259 --> 31:37.462
Does he have just one
mirror in the house?

31:37.562 --> 31:41.699
- Sinatra, Sammy, Dino...
- Jenny...

31:41.799 --> 31:43.968
I think we have three choices.

31:44.068 --> 31:46.070
- One...
- ...Bing.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.940
...we go through there, but I
don't want to go through there.

31:50.240 --> 31:53.678
Two, we go back to
the talking teakettle.

31:53.778 --> 31:57.159
But I don't want to go back
to the talking teakettle.

31:57.815 --> 31:59.917
And three,

32:00.952 --> 32:02.821
- the clown.
- Bored of sex.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.789
- I don't want to see the clown again.
- How could you

32:04.889 --> 32:06.524
be bored of it?
You're just a fucking...

32:06.624 --> 32:09.093
- I think we have another option.
- ...sphere.

32:09.193 --> 32:11.273
Let's get the fuck out of here!

32:12.697 --> 32:14.367
Pretty good joke, wasn't it?

33:15.693 --> 33:17.864
You little shit!

33:56.768 --> 33:59.007
Don't touch anything.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.174
What the hell happened here?

34:03.274 --> 34:05.913
Some people set fire to this place...

34:07.011 --> 34:11.581
after they lost their jobs.
They didn't want to have fun.

34:11.681 --> 34:14.286
They just wanted to be
able put food on the table.

34:15.152 --> 34:17.621
How do you know that?

34:17.722 --> 34:19.690
My dad.

34:19.791 --> 34:23.429
He, reads a lot now
that he stays home.

34:25.096 --> 34:27.966
- I'm sorry about that.
- About what?

34:28.065 --> 34:30.201
That he can't get a job.

34:30.301 --> 34:34.105
Oh, he'd get one, but...

34:34.205 --> 34:36.878
it's easier to stay home and drink.

34:39.109 --> 34:41.882
You know, Biff was right.

34:44.315 --> 34:47.658
Jenny, I'm sorry.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.491
Don't be.

34:53.190 --> 34:57.762
Ever since my mom died, it's like...

34:57.862 --> 35:00.340
he's just trying to find his
place in the world, I guess.

35:01.499 --> 35:05.380
It's not his fault.
I really love him.

35:32.296 --> 35:35.843
- What was that?
- I think it's just a bat.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.908
I think it's dozens of bats!

37:06.357 --> 37:07.858
Okay.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.978
Fuckin' shithole of a house.

38:31.909 --> 38:33.784
Biff!

38:34.745 --> 38:38.383
Biff! Hey!

38:38.983 --> 38:42.796
- Who's there?
- Don't you recognize my voice?

38:43.821 --> 38:46.691
Who the hell are you, asshole?

38:46.791 --> 38:50.670
I'm your horny mommy.

38:50.995 --> 38:55.041
Then get ready to
have your ass kicked!

38:59.470 --> 39:02.316
Do you want a diaper?

39:03.674 --> 39:05.246
Tell me...

39:06.077 --> 39:10.320
how's about a little... tongue?

39:47.884 --> 39:51.355
Hey, hey, hey,
look at those two beauties!

39:51.455 --> 39:54.892
Oh, my goodness. What a lovely...

39:54.992 --> 39:57.197
smell it.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.237
Oh, no, not again!

40:04.368 --> 40:07.138
I can't restrain myself.
I have to chew their brains out.

40:07.238 --> 40:11.108
I want to feel that juicy taste.
I want to suck 'em all to the last drop.

40:11.208 --> 40:15.980
I want to lick it down from their...
from their broken skulls. I want 'em.

40:16.080 --> 40:19.283
Shut up, you stupid perv!
What's wrong with you?

40:19.383 --> 40:22.787
I'm so horny, man. Freakin' horny.

40:22.887 --> 40:27.658
Hey, you sexy, brainy beast. Come to papa!
I'm gonna eat your brains out!

40:27.958 --> 40:31.095
Slowly, softly...

40:31.195 --> 40:34.070
yum-yum. Yum.

40:37.368 --> 40:39.575
Did you hear that noise?

40:41.572 --> 40:43.647
What noise?

40:44.475 --> 40:46.444
Never mind.

40:46.744 --> 40:50.486
I just hate this place so much.

41:21.579 --> 41:24.853
I've had it up to here
with this whole place!

41:32.823 --> 41:34.625
Sam?

41:46.971 --> 41:48.677
Sam?

41:50.140 --> 41:51.741
Sam!

41:53.277 --> 41:55.357
Sam!

42:11.195 --> 42:16.066
Sometimes everyone
needs to relax a bit.

42:16.166 --> 42:21.405
You wouldn't like to fall apart either,
would you, Sammy boy?

42:21.505 --> 42:25.143
You wouldn't want to fall to pieces.

45:14.445 --> 45:17.323
Don't run away, partner.

45:29.159 --> 45:33.631
I'm just a tiny, lonely yellow duck

45:33.731 --> 45:37.410
who wants to play with his duck-dude.

45:51.248 --> 45:54.785
Just like my momma said,

45:54.885 --> 45:57.054
"Quack, quack, quacker.

45:57.154 --> 45:59.894
Time to die, motherfucker!"

46:34.424 --> 46:35.525
Sam?

47:21.104 --> 47:23.616
Jenny.

47:25.275 --> 47:28.312
Jenny. Jenny.

47:28.412 --> 47:31.322
He wants you, Jenny.

47:33.483 --> 47:36.424
He kill you, Jenny.

47:37.821 --> 47:39.894
Jenny.

47:41.959 --> 47:45.370
He'll kill you, Jenny.

48:01.845 --> 48:05.015
Sam! Sam!

48:05.115 --> 48:07.691
Sam! Sam!

48:23.533 --> 48:26.443
Sam...

48:38.849 --> 48:43.487
Here comes your nasty little friend!

48:43.587 --> 48:47.864
I came as soon as I could.
I hope I'm not late.

48:52.028 --> 48:54.765
What do you want from me?

48:55.065 --> 48:59.636
Oh, it would take
a long time to tell.

48:59.736 --> 49:02.646
I'd rather show you.

49:17.888 --> 49:19.656
Samuel Tully!

49:19.756 --> 49:23.227
You will come back right now

49:23.327 --> 49:26.263
and I will tear out

49:26.363 --> 49:28.868
your heart!

52:37.420 --> 52:40.990
Hello, my pretty.

52:45.028 --> 52:47.574
Did you come to play with me?

52:48.565 --> 52:50.233
To... to play?

52:50.333 --> 52:53.703
Yes. You can start.

52:53.803 --> 52:56.840
Start what? Oh, my God.

52:56.940 --> 53:01.912
Are you a talking spider?
What are the rules?

53:02.012 --> 53:07.050
The rules are made up during play.
You have to make a move.

53:07.150 --> 53:10.620
If you lose, I'll eat well today.

53:11.220 --> 53:15.525
No. You go first.

53:15.625 --> 53:18.203
I'll give you a little
bit of a head start.

53:20.463 --> 53:24.434
So, I'm facing a master of games.

53:24.534 --> 53:27.470
Good. Very good.

53:27.770 --> 53:31.875
Let's see. Use the head to throw.

53:31.975 --> 53:33.486
Excuse me?

53:39.549 --> 53:42.219
Now, I made a throw

53:42.319 --> 53:45.755
and I will say what I am supposed to.

53:45.855 --> 53:49.693
One, two, four, six.

53:49.793 --> 53:54.035
These fine little corpses
can do no tricks.

54:02.806 --> 54:05.108
Talk about blind luck.

54:05.708 --> 54:09.513
A good throw, a nice throw.

54:09.613 --> 54:11.781
Won't you say the line?

54:11.881 --> 54:14.084
The... the line?

54:14.184 --> 54:16.486
The line, of course.

54:16.586 --> 54:19.557
Five, one...

54:19.689 --> 54:22.325
four and two.

54:22.425 --> 54:25.262
I hope these lines are
good enough for you.

54:25.362 --> 54:29.599
Oh, you are good. Very good.

54:29.699 --> 54:32.002
But let's see how you deal with this!

54:32.102 --> 54:35.338
Two, seven, six, three.

54:35.438 --> 54:39.418
I'll cut your head off
and eat your knee!

54:52.455 --> 54:57.027
Seven, three, nine, two.

54:57.127 --> 55:00.564
You'll lose if you
don't let me go, too.

55:01.464 --> 55:05.735
This can't be true!
You must be a true champion!

55:05.835 --> 55:10.307
I have to get myself together.
One, six, seven, four.

55:10.407 --> 55:13.818
I'll rip your heart out
on the second floor.

55:21.951 --> 55:26.089
Five, three, two, seven and five.

55:26.189 --> 55:28.792
I believe it's your final jive.

55:28.892 --> 55:31.294
I'm gonna shit my pants!

55:31.394 --> 55:35.966
No... hell no! This can't be true!

55:36.066 --> 55:39.603
No one has ever beaten me! No!

55:40.203 --> 55:44.335
- Take it!
- It's... it's a...

55:44.436 --> 55:48.351
I couldn't bear the shame.
I had to quit on top.

57:25.642 --> 57:29.346
I'm gonna eat... your...

57:29.446 --> 57:31.548
soul...

57:32.549 --> 57:34.127
buddy.

59:57.326 --> 01:00:00.468
- Jenny!
- Sam!

01:00:03.332 --> 01:00:06.038
I thought I'd never see you again.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:09.013
Let's get out of here!

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.731
Where we came in, we should also
be able to get out that way.

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:36.799
It's like we've been
wandering around for years.

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:39.744
Do you think its past midnight?
What happened to Biff?

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:44.774
- Jenny.
- Yeah?

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:48.811
I have to tell you something, and I
have to tell you something right now,

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:53.182
because if I don't tell you now,
I might never get the chance to.

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:55.118
Sam, I don't think now's the time.

01:00:55.818 --> 01:01:01.696
Jenny, I have to tell you something
right now, because I might never...

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:05.762
You're such a wonderful girl...

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:10.904
and you deserve so much better than
that idiot Biff and his stupid buddies.

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:15.972
You're smart and funny...

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:20.153
and charming and smart and...

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:24.283
unbelievably beautiful.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:29.062
I just want you to
know that I... I...

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.757
Somebody help!

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:37.934
I'm begging you!

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:41.070
I'm bleeding!

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:52.509
I ate her brains.
Completely, totally.

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:55.278
I didn't dick around with it.
I did it right.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:58.381
This woman was tasty.

01:01:59.081 --> 01:02:02.385
As always, so damn exciting.

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:06.923
You know what? You are the most
cynical scumbag on this planet.

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:08.591
So what's going on otherwise?

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:12.895
Ginger said that he doesn't want
to be cleaning bloody mirrors

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:17.038
for the next few days. He didn't
have an appetite for that rat.

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.335
Shut up!

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:23.873
Couldn't you do this somewhere else?
It's grossly disgusting.

01:02:24.673 --> 01:02:25.977
I'm sorry.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.680
My stomach's been acting up.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:34.283
Biff! We can't let
them kill him, Sam!

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:37.286
Let's tear him apart, here and now.
I want his brain.

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:41.290
I smell it. I wanna chew it out.

01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:46.062
Why here? Why can't you
wait a little bit longer?

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:51.167
You are a fucking lazy brainman.
I'm carrying this heavy rat.

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.436
So tell me... tell me now...

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:56.143
why the hell can't you wait?

01:02:57.573 --> 01:03:02.045
Why can't we take him to the
Ferris wheel and tear him apart?

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:05.214
Oh, I love tearing stuff apart.

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:09.919
Maybe it's because we've done
this a thousand times? It's boring.

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:13.990
I still don't think the
Ferris wheel is boring.

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.259
I don't! I really don't.

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:19.395
That's because you are a major ass.

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:25.001
Fine! Fine! Fine! Fine!
Fine! Fine! Fine!

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:28.938
I've had freakin' enough!
It's fucking unbelievable!

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:31.846
Unbelievable that you can't
shut your giant trap.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.892
And "blah, blah, blah,"
all day long, all day long.

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:45.254
And since there is no other
dumb-ass who can listen to you,

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:50.226
I have to do it all the fucking time!

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:51.661
And a little bit more.

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:55.832
Oh my God, oh my God!
You are such an antisocial prick!

01:03:56.432 --> 01:04:01.170
Antisocial? Me? Have you ever
looked in a fucking mirror?

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.940
What the hell are you thinking, man?
Look at yourself!

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.212
Like a fuckin' twin sister of
that fuckin' elephant man.

01:04:10.412 --> 01:04:12.665
- That hurt.
- I'm not done yet.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:16.419
Do you think you are so damn entertaining
that you're gonna be the next Eddie Murphy

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.387
or the next Arsenio Hall?

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:21.263
- Oh, hell no!
- Let me go!

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:27.396
Oh my God, what is
that fucking smell?

01:04:27.996 --> 01:04:32.868
Never mind. The issue is,
what do we do with this rat?

01:04:33.268 --> 01:04:34.875
Shut up!

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:38.708
You know what? Fuck it.

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.610
Do it yourself.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.846
Fine, fine! Fine!

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.681
Oh my God, fine!

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:46.916
So be it!

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:51.158
I don't care either!
I won't do your work for you!

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:55.725
You fucking brain-eating moron!

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:58.461
- Moron!
- I heard that!

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:01.473
Then fuck you!

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.140
And fuck you too.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:18.681
Biff! Biff, are you okay?

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:20.383
Jenny?

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.586
Jenny! Those...

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.989
did you see them?

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:29.826
You have to stand up.
We have to get out of here.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:32.995
What are they? What were they?

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:36.642
They were not human!
Those... those...

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.076
What?! This is all your fault,
you little shit!

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:46.809
- Biff, don't do this!
- If this little dumb-ass

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:50.680
hadn't come along trying
to steal my girlfriend,

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.583
I wouldn't be in this much shit now.

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:59.121
What I want to do more than anything
else is run your guts up a flagpole,

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:01.657
you little worm!

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:05.136
If I ever see...

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:24.280
- Jenny, run! I'll lead one away!
- Sam, no!

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:16.007
I hate this fucking amusement park!

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:25.275
All right. Fuck it!

01:07:27.175 --> 01:07:32.148
Nobody fucks with Biff
Russell, you hear?

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:34.123
Nobody fucks with...

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:48.741
Let me off this thing!

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:10.153
Just let me off! Let me off!

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:16.185
Hello, Sam.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:19.388
I hope you got some rest.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.758
Let me go!

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:26.529
I can't do that, unfortunately.

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:31.533
- There's nothing funny in it.
- This is funny? Killing people?

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:37.582
Torturing them? This whole goddamn
place is the brainchild of your sick mind!

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:40.416
You call this a joke?

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:43.645
How can it not be funny?

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:46.783
After all... I'm laughing!

01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:54.099
I will tell you a story, my friend.

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:04.567
I like good stories. May I?

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:09.216
So, the fish, the penguin...

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:17.680
Well, sorry, it's just hard
to tell it without laughing.

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:22.618
So, the fish, the penguin
and the chainsaw

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:25.287
go on a camping trip.

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:29.125
They go on a small
hike on the third day.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:32.928
Nothing too serious...
just to the next wood over...

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:37.877
but they still get lost.
Can you follow?

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.804
Well, now.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:46.609
As they mope around
the woods, night falls.

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:50.146
They can barely see
a thing in the dark.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:54.917
They stumble about.
They're scared shitless.

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:59.722
You know how it is.
So, the fish speaks up and says,

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:03.192
"We've got to make a
plan to live through this.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:06.162
If we don't get out of here soon,

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.998
we must sacrifice one of us

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:12.134
to have something to eat."

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.770
You sick animal, untie me!

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:19.408
Wait. It's not even remotely over.

01:11:19.808 --> 01:11:22.945
The penguin thinks about
what the fish said

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:26.515
and asks the chainsaw, "Look, buddy.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:29.852
How long can you go without food?"

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:34.790
In response, the chainsaw
cuts off the penguin's head

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:38.761
without a word and turns to the fish,

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:41.397
"I hope you don't mind."

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:44.933
The fish replies, "Of course not.

01:11:45.533 --> 01:11:51.340
"I didn't get it anyway... what is a
penguin doing in a fucking forest?"

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.444
It kills me.

01:11:56.544 --> 01:11:59.615
Just so that you understand,

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:03.085
you have no business here whatsoever.

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:07.022
Neither you nor
your little girlfriend.

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:11.360
Hereabouts,
we easily sacrifice anybody

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.804
to help the others survive...

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:18.567
those long days...

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:21.804
extremely easily.

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:24.106
With your permission,

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:27.409
I have some minor
business to deal with...

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:30.549
your little girlfriend.

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:39.588
She is being very naughty.

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:43.397
Leave her alone!
You hear me? I'm right here!

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:51.967
She's not the one you need!

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:54.803
Oh, she is.

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:57.473
I think I need her

01:12:57.573 --> 01:13:00.882
more than anything.

01:13:32.874 --> 01:13:36.119
Sam? Sam?

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:47.290
Maybe you are waiting
for someone, my dear?

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:52.227
If I was mean,

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:57.069
I would think that you
were not happy to see me.

01:13:57.866 --> 01:13:59.268
What's wrong?

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:04.173
Maybe you don't find me
as good as good old Sam?

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.911
What have you done to him?

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:09.845
Nothing... yet.

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:12.948
He still has both of his eyes.

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:16.685
Hereabouts, that's pretty rare.

01:14:17.785 --> 01:14:22.691
- You're not a real clown, are you?
- You may be right,

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:25.531
but don't tell anyone!

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:35.838
But in truth, if you
ask me what I am,

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:39.608
I can tell you easily,

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:44.947
I am the worst nightmare
you've ever had.

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:48.217
I'm the eternal scream

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:52.988
in the innocent
children's frozen minds!

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:56.558
I am the Grim Reaper

01:14:56.658 --> 01:15:01.063
of every hope and every soul!

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:05.401
I am the great collector.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:08.604
The bone crusher.

01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:13.014
The spawn of darkness!

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:19.314
I'm your last friend
in this stinking place.

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:22.718
Feel free to call me
something like this:

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:25.387
Clown...

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:27.890
Clowney...

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:31.126
Mr. Clown.

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:35.597
But never, never call me Dorothy!

01:15:36.197 --> 01:15:38.607
I hate that fucking name.

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:44.709
"Dorothy." You wouldn't dare.

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:54.961
Take this shit off of me!

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:04.126
Fuck you!

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:07.129
Release me!

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:12.968
The fish, the penguin and the
chainsaw go camping together.

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:16.138
Release me, or I swear

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:18.707
I will kill you!

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:23.806
They go on a small hike on the
third day... nothing too serious,

01:16:23.907 --> 01:16:27.449
- just over to the next wood.
- Fuck you!

01:16:27.549 --> 01:16:30.085
They still get lost. Can you follow?

01:16:30.685 --> 01:16:33.889
As they mope around
the woods, night falls.

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:37.559
They can barely see a thing in
the dark. They stumble about.

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:41.169
They're scared shitless.
You know how it is.

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:48.070
So the fish speaks up and says, "We've
got to make a plan to live through this.

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:49.938
If we don't get out of here soon,

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:55.027
we must sacrifice one of us to have
something to eat." So the penguin replies,

01:16:55.128 --> 01:16:58.347
"Fuck your plan!
Fuck yourself, you little..."

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:02.551
That's not how the joke goes.

01:17:04.151 --> 01:17:05.721
You screw up...

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:09.130
even my joke!

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.533
Fucking fish!

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:44.998
Oh, you really lit me up.

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:18.661
- You're bleeding.
- It's just a scratch.

01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:22.831
- What happened to your glasses?
- You won't believe me if I told you.

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:26.211
I had to shoot out the brain of
a giant spider with a shotgun.

01:18:26.312 --> 01:18:29.044
Okay. Okay, you won.

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:39.247
I...

01:18:40.474 --> 01:18:42.354
thank you.

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:45.187
It's... it's nothing.

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:48.430
It's what I'm here for.

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:21.757
Your drawings are rubbish by the way.
They look nothing like me.

01:19:21.857 --> 01:19:25.327
All right, sorry.
You're such a smart alec.

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:29.500
- Excuse me, Mr. Comic Book.
- It's good that you got a pretty face.

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:34.069
It's good that you... I don't...

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:37.806
Okay, so... so you're
all brave now, yeah?

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:39.941
You're gonna not be afraid
of spiders or anything?

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:42.978
- Excuse me, I can handle myself, okay?
- God, what was that?

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:45.481
- Oh, you're trying to freak me out now.
- Shut up.

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:49.218
- Oh, I'm so scared. Biff! Biff!
- That's not funny.

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:53.426
- Don't speak ill of the dead.
- Okay, okay, sorry.

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:10.935
What was that?

01:22:14.729 --> 01:22:17.173
I think it's a velociraptor.

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:30.717
I think it's dozens of velociraptors!

01:22:38.052 --> 01:22:40.625
- Yes!
- Cut!

01:22:41.305 --> 01:22:47.357
