00:52.051 --> 00:55.221
[water gurgles]

00:58.475 --> 01:02.520
-It's a burst pipe.
-My patience is bursting.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.357
-[Ruffo] How do you fix it?
-I'll try to schedule it. What do you mean?
You just need to replace the pipe, right?

01:10.028 --> 01:12.405
We have to schedule it.
Report the problem.

01:12.655 --> 01:16.326
Request the pipe, check if it's in stock,
then send in a team.

01:17.744 --> 01:21.039
-You can say that without opening it up?
-I know how it goes.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.751
[Ruffo] How long will it take?

01:24.834 --> 01:28.129
-About two or three weeks.
-You must be kidding!

01:28.213 --> 01:30.840
And sewage will keep leaking out
for three weeks?

01:30.924 --> 01:34.385
-By the book, that's how long it takes.
-[Ruffo] What do you mean?

01:34.969 --> 01:36.846
Can it be done "not by the book"?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.598
Some folks do it on the side.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.604
Can you put me in touch?

01:45.980 --> 01:47.023
Hold this.

01:47.690 --> 01:50.068
You can talk to Mr. João.
I know he'll do it.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.155
-Mr. João?
-Mr. João gets the job done.

01:55.031 --> 01:57.200
Tell him Alfredo referred him.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.411
-And you are Alfredo?
-Yes, that's me.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.623
MR. JOÃO

02:09.419 --> 02:11.631
Some angels have wings.
Others, a mustache.

02:13.424 --> 02:14.425
That's me.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.388
Fuck!

02:21.850 --> 02:23.852
[motor starts]

02:25.395 --> 02:28.356
[Verena] <i>They call it Club 13,</i>
<i>but it's a cartel.</i>

02:28.439 --> 02:31.067
[Verena] <i>The 13 biggest contractors</i>
<i>joined with politicians.</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:34.445
[Verena] <i>Together, they overprice</i>
<i>billionaire Petrobrasil contracts.</i>

02:34.529 --> 02:37.907
[Verena] Billions of dollars
were taken from public funds.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.119
[Verena] The first step
is to arrest the contractors.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.914
[Verena] It's all documented here
in JPR and Ibrahim's plea bargain.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.126
For Miller &amp; Bretch,
we still need to understand

02:48.209 --> 02:52.422
how they inject money back
into the system, how they pay bribes.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.548
That's not all.

02:53.631 --> 02:57.218
Ricardo Bretch overprices budgets
and gets one contract after the other,

02:57.302 --> 03:01.180
but without using the currency dealers'
shell companies to pay bribes.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.309
-[Verena] I don't know how they do it yet.
-[Rigo] Still not enough.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.854
That's why I requested 12 detentions
and a search and seizure. If I go in there, I'll find what I need
to also bust Ricardo Bretch.

03:11.482 --> 03:14.944
Thirteen search and seizures.
No detentions. For now.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.530
[Verena] With everything that came out
of the plea bargains?

03:17.614 --> 03:21.034
Neither Ibrahim nor JPR participated
in any contractor cartel meeting.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.369
But they knew everything.
They were part of it.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.289
They provided details!
It all matches. It's in the annexes.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.333
[Rigo] I can't order an arrest
based on hearsay.

03:28.416 --> 03:32.003
If the informers' claims are worthless,
why make deals with them?

03:32.086 --> 03:34.714
I never said worthless.
They just need to be confirmed.

03:34.797 --> 03:38.051
All major government
building contracts went to Club 13.

03:38.134 --> 03:41.304
-It's a fact! Hard data.
-A fact. Not necessarily a crime.

03:41.387 --> 03:45.183
-What about the money moving around?
-Good, but insufficient.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.477
I don't know what's sufficient
for you, Rigo!

03:47.560 --> 03:51.481
The testimony of someone who actually
participated in the cartel meetings.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.900
A confession from one of the 13?

03:59.364 --> 04:00.573
[Verena] <i>A mega-contractor</i>

04:00.657 --> 04:04.035
willing to testify against himself
and his partners in crime.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.079
[Verena] That's "all" Rigo wants.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.414
[Guilhome] Where do we start?

04:08.498 --> 04:11.167
That's what I felt like asking the judge.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.670
Let's check it all over.
One contractor at a time.

04:14.128 --> 04:18.132
We can stick with the police in São Paulo,
and wait for a loophole. A slipup.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.677
-How long do you think that'll take?
-[Guilhome] Too long.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.303
They'll destroy everything.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.471
[Verena sighs]

04:23.554 --> 04:26.140
Sometimes, it seems
like it's all set up to fail.

04:26.975 --> 04:27.809
[she groans]

04:27.892 --> 04:29.394
I'm in so much pain.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.853
[Guilhome] What's wrong with you, girl?

04:30.937 --> 04:34.107
I'm in pain. It'll pass.
It's already passing.

04:38.778 --> 04:39.862
[Vander] Verena?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.998
[dialing tone]

05:07.974 --> 05:09.726
[Guilhome opens door]

05:14.856 --> 05:17.483
-Did you shit your pants?
-Just get going!

05:18.526 --> 05:21.821
-Seat belt on.
-When I'm good and ready, in five minutes.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.574
[car motor]

05:29.287 --> 05:33.541
[Ruffo] <i>Arresting Brazil's 13 biggest</i>
<i>contractors was not going to be easy.</i>

05:34.751 --> 05:36.836
[Ruffo] <i>Verena needed my help.</i>

05:39.589 --> 05:42.341
[footsteps on stairs]

05:44.302 --> 05:47.555
<i>Guilhome would get things ready,</i>
<i>open the doors...</i>

05:48.139 --> 05:51.309
<i>and convince corrupt employees</i>
<i>to collaborate with us.</i>

05:52.935 --> 05:57.148
[Ruffo] <i>But the dirty work, again,</i>
<i>was on me.</i>

05:57.231 --> 05:58.858
I need the key to cell five.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.985
[Ruffo] <i>Because, in the end,</i>
<i>a retired policeman</i>

06:01.069 --> 06:02.737
<i>can't be punished by the corporation.</i>

06:02.820 --> 06:05.114
[Ruffo] <i>There's no need</i>
<i>to give in to the rules...</i>

06:05.198 --> 06:07.241
<i>...or to the bureaucracy.</i>

06:08.284 --> 06:10.953
[quiet movement in the background]

06:14.624 --> 06:16.459
[Ibrahim sniffs]

06:17.293 --> 06:19.962
[Ibrahim] That's a nasty smell.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.923
[Ruffo] I thought you'd be used to it.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.971
-[Ibrahim] Are you alive?
-Hell, yes, I am.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.182
[Ruffo] And you are locked up.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.434
[Ibrahim] Not for long.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.269
[Ruffo] I figured.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.523
[Ibrahim sighs]

06:38.940 --> 06:40.316
You happy you're getting out?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.402
[Ibrahim] It's all right.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.030
Life's good when you have money.

06:46.823 --> 06:47.824
[Ibrahim] Very good.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.618
But it's dangerous out there.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.370
So many maniacs running around.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.748
I'm not afraid of you, Ruffo.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.710
You're that kid from school.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.506
-[Ibrahim] "That kid," remember?
-I do.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.883
To me, you're that punk from school.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.344
[Ruffo] A punk, forever a punk. Remember?

07:08.427 --> 07:11.180
You woke me up to reminisce
about our childhood in Londrina?

07:11.806 --> 07:12.640
[Ruffo] No.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.314
[Ruffo sniffles]

07:22.525 --> 07:24.193
[Ruffo] The contractors' club.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.529
[Ruffo] Club 13.

07:27.196 --> 07:30.116
Who's the biggest coward?
Who's the blabbermouth?

07:30.199 --> 07:31.492
That's not for you, Ruffo!

07:32.201 --> 07:33.536
You're retired.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.956
-Due to bipolar disorder, right?
-Yes.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.835
[Ibrahim] Do you know the story
about the bipolar bear?

07:41.043 --> 07:43.880
Someone asked the bipolar bear
if it liked snow.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.799
It said, "I do."

07:47.842 --> 07:48.968
"I don't."

07:49.051 --> 07:50.136
[Ruffo laughs]

07:50.219 --> 07:51.846
"I do."

07:51.929 --> 07:53.389
"I don't."

07:53.473 --> 07:54.682
"I do. I do."

07:56.392 --> 07:59.520
-Who's the pussy?
-I'm not in that club.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.647
[Ruffo] But you carried money for them.

08:02.482 --> 08:06.277
-[Ruffo] Many money-filled suitcases.
-I haven't carried any suitcases...

08:06.360 --> 08:08.529
-Who's the weakest?
-...for a long time.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.787
[Ruffo inhales and exhales deeply]

08:21.083 --> 08:23.085
You used to be more careful.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.254
[Ibrahim] It was you, you son of a bitch?

08:26.214 --> 08:27.340
You're a son of a bitch.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.051
-I've been following your love life.
-[Ibrahim] Piece of shit.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.844
-Pretty wild.
-[Ibrahim] Piece of shit!

08:31.928 --> 08:33.261
Looks like a cheap porn flick.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.222
[Ibrahim laughs]

08:34.304 --> 08:39.602
A girlfriend here, a car to a friend,
a flat to another, health insurance.

08:39.684 --> 08:41.102
[Ruffo] It's a lot of work.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.858
When your wife finds out about it,
she'll suck you dry.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.904
-Your grandchildren will have no money.
-Silvério Anunciato.

08:53.324 --> 08:57.328
I don't know if he's the biggest pussy,
but Silvério Anunciato is an asshole.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.999
[Ruffo] Silvério from Estruturax?

09:03.042 --> 09:06.003
He's a motherfucker
and you always fuck up.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.714
You'll get along well.
May you be happy together.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.216
[Ibrahim] Let me sleep now.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.428
[Ibrahim] And leave my wife alone.
You have Regina to annoy.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.389
-[Ruffo] Good night.
-[Ibrahim] Excuse me.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.559
[keys rattle, cell door opens]

09:20.309 --> 09:24.021
[Ruffo, singing] <i> Hush, little baby,</i>
<i>Don't say a word</i>

09:24.105 --> 09:26.899
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird</i>

09:26.983 --> 09:31.737
<i>And if that mockingbird don't sing</i>

09:32.321 --> 09:39.245
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring...</i>

09:39.662 --> 09:44.333
[Ruffo] <i>Ibrahim and JPR's plea bargains</i>
<i>left Club 13 fucking scared.</i>

09:46.043 --> 09:48.963
ONE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTIONS

09:49.046 --> 09:51.257
[Ruffo] <i>It was the eve of the election.</i>

09:52.216 --> 09:56.178
[Ruffo] <i>The last thing the contractors</i>
<i>wanted was to be under the spotlight...</i>

09:56.679 --> 09:58.806
<i>...amid a political dispute.</i>

10:00.808 --> 10:04.770
[Ruffo] <i>The only way out for them was</i>
<i>Mario Garcez Brito, the Wizard.</i>

10:05.479 --> 10:07.440
[The Wizard] Good evening, everyone.

10:07.523 --> 10:11.611
[Ruffo] <i>If the deal he was offering</i>
<i>the Attorney General was accepted,</i>

10:11.902 --> 10:14.113
<i>Operation Jet Wash would die out.</i>

10:14.196 --> 10:16.324
Is everyone here?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.827
-Shall we begin?
-Ricardo isn't here.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.829
But he didn't confirm.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.331
[Silvério coughs]

10:24.165 --> 10:29.086
Silvério, would you mind
not smoking in here?

10:33.090 --> 10:34.133
Ah.

10:35.801 --> 10:40.348
The talks with the Attorney General
were very productive.

10:41.932 --> 10:45.394
He's open to negotiations.

10:47.146 --> 10:52.234
We talked about a R$ 1-billion fine.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.945
-R$ 1 billion?
-Didn't we say a symbolic figure?

10:55.029 --> 10:59.659
We must give the impression
that it is a significant amount.

10:59.742 --> 11:04.121
One billion is a thousand million!
R$ 1,000 million.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.539
It's a lot of money!

11:05.623 --> 11:08.542
If we get out of this unscathed,
we might consider it.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.003
It'll be split between 13, right?

11:11.087 --> 11:15.758
-A little over 75 million each.
-R$ 76,923,000, gentlemen.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.635
What for?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.179
Out of the question. It makes no sense.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.600
Who on earth allowed half a dozen feds
topple a country's economy?

11:24.683 --> 11:26.268
That cockamamie president.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.480
She's letting it ride,
thinking it won't affect her.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.816
-But this...
-What if she loses the election?

11:31.899 --> 11:34.151
-Well, tomorrow...
-Nobody sleeps tonight.

11:34.235 --> 11:38.030
It's tight. It may very well happen.
That <i>Read It</i> article...

11:38.114 --> 11:40.991
If Lucio wins,
he will stop the investigation right away!

11:41.075 --> 11:42.368
Before they get to him.

11:42.451 --> 11:45.204
But we can't count on it
because that nut is still ahead.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.790
It should be resolved by now.
The election is tomorrow.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.458
We need to sort this out.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.669
Just a minute, gentlemen.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.296
Let's focus.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.340
[The Wizard] Ricardo...

11:56.841 --> 12:00.428
...nobody knows exactly

12:00.553 --> 12:04.682
what João Pedro and Ibrahim have said
in their plea bargain agreements.

12:04.765 --> 12:08.644
The seventh world economy doesn't go under
because one employee gets caught.

12:08.727 --> 12:11.939
-If it were only that...
-What's 70 million to you?

12:12.022 --> 12:15.901
If you were careless, it's not fair
that I should have to pay for it.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.404
-We're all in the same boat.
-I'm in another boat.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.573
Different material, different purpose.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.199
Completely different.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.076
I'm sorry but...

12:24.160 --> 12:26.871
if you've been incompetent, amateurs...

12:27.371 --> 12:30.040
it's got nothing to do with me.
That's your problem.

12:30.124 --> 12:33.794
[footsteps, then door opens and closes]

12:33.878 --> 12:36.172
Let's divide one billion by 12.

12:36.755 --> 12:41.427
[The Wizard coughs heavily]

13:06.952 --> 13:10.748
[Regina stirs the cooking pot]

13:19.006 --> 13:20.341
[Ruffo] I'm going on a trip.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.221
I don't know if I'll be here
when you get back.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.811
[Ruffo counts some bills]

13:45.491 --> 13:47.743
[Ruffo] <i>In the second round</i>
<i>of the election,</i>

13:47.826 --> 13:51.622
<i>voters were going to choose</i>
<i>much more than the next president.</i> [Ruffo] <i>They would unwittingly decide</i>
<i>the future of my investigations.</i>

13:59.838 --> 14:02.675
[Ruffo] <i>Janete didn't think Jet Wash</i>
<i>would ever reach her</i>

14:02.758 --> 14:04.301
<i>or former president Higino.</i>

14:05.344 --> 14:06.679
[Ruffo] <i>In her mind,</i>

14:06.762 --> 14:08.764

14:10.849 --> 14:12.476
[Ruffo] <i>If she won the election,</i>

14:12.560 --> 14:14.645
<i>the operation would continue.</i>

14:14.728 --> 14:15.604
[machine beeps]

14:15.688 --> 14:17.147
PRESIDENT
LUCIO LEMES PSDB

[camera shutters]

14:20.234 --> 14:21.735
OFFICE OF ELECTIONS

14:21.819 --> 14:24.530
[Ruffo] <i>Lucio Lemes, on the other hand,</i>
<i>was a lot more cunning.</i>

14:25.072 --> 14:26.949
[Ruffo] <i>He was experienced.</i>

14:27.700 --> 14:31.912
[Ruffo] <i>He knew that, sooner or later,</i>
<i>Jet Wash would reach him.</i>

14:34.290 --> 14:37.710
[Ruffo] <i>The most powerful businessmen</i>
<i>in the country understood this,</i>

14:37.793 --> 14:40.963
<i>and joined forces with the right wing</i>
<i>and the mainstream press.</i>

14:41.338 --> 14:43.632
[Ruffo] <i>They didn't want</i>
<i>to be investigated.</i>

14:57.229 --> 14:59.899
[Ruffo] <i>Regardless</i>
<i>of the election results,</i>

14:59.982 --> 15:03.611
<i>no contractor would talk</i>
<i>of their own free will.</i>

15:09.825 --> 15:11.660
Cigarettes. Awful but good, huh?

15:12.411 --> 15:16.081
An adult pacifier.
I quit that shit. It was messing me up.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.460
-Shall we go for a ride?
-Who are you?

15:19.543 --> 15:22.421
Let's go for a ride, the three of us.

15:23.714 --> 15:24.715
[Ruffo] Get your car.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.056
[Ruffo] <i>Pull over.</i>

15:35.267 --> 15:36.685
[Ruffo] <i>Club 13.</i>

15:36.769 --> 15:39.855
[Ruffo] Everyone is going down.
The whole Club is going down.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.316
[Ruffo] I'll give you a piece of advice.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.653
Go to Curitiba, cooperate,
and they might let you off the hook.

15:46.362 --> 15:50.699
It's like a silver bullet,
but only for the first one to get there.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.327
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-[Ruffo] You do.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.121
I came a really long way
just to give you this advice.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.206
By bus.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.292
[Ruffo] If you don't listen to me,
you'll end up in Curitiba anyway.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.460
[Ruffo] But in handcuffs.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.005
And handcuffs suck.

16:07.925 --> 16:08.801
[door closes]

16:13.013 --> 16:16.642
Don't even think about telling
your buddies the Club is going down.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.062
I'd know it was you.

16:27.778 --> 16:31.573
[Reporter] <i>Janete Ruscov has been</i>
<i>reelected as President of Brazil</i>

16:31.657 --> 16:33.367
<i>with 51% of the votes</i>

16:33.450 --> 16:36.370
<i>in the closest presidential race</i>

16:36.453 --> 16:39.498
[Janete, on TV] <i>I'd like to thank</i>

[Janete] <i>Together, we've endured</i>
<i>a long and difficult campaign,</i>

16:51.844 --> 16:53.387

16:53.470 --> 16:54.722
[Janete] <i>Thank you, Thames.</i>

16:56.265 --> 16:58.726
<i>Our second term</i>

16:58.809 --> 17:00.394

17:00.477 --> 17:03.480

17:03.564 --> 17:06.108
<i>to fighting corruption.</i>

17:06.191 --> 17:08.944
[Ruffo] <i>The country was</i>
<i>completely divided.</i>

17:09.694 --> 17:13.531
[Ruffo] <i>While half the population was</i>
<i>celebrating the left wing's victory...</i>

17:14.491 --> 17:17.286
<i>...the other half was banging on pans.</i>

17:18.078 --> 17:21.540
[Janete speaks on TV]

17:22.249 --> 17:24.376
[Ruffo] <i>If the people decided</i>
<i>to bang on pans</i>

17:24.460 --> 17:26.837
<i>for everything that was wrong</i>

17:27.463 --> 17:29.882
<i>...carnival would never end.</i>

17:29.965 --> 17:33.969
[pots and pans banging,
people shouting on the street]

17:39.475 --> 17:42.352
[pots and pans banging]

17:57.743 --> 17:58.744
Who?

17:59.495 --> 18:00.621
Whose lawyer?

18:01.330 --> 18:02.331
Who's that?

18:03.791 --> 18:06.543
Right. OK. See you there.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.005
-How many of those have you taken?
-What did he say?

18:10.380 --> 18:13.008
One of the contractors' lawyers
requested a meeting.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.676
-One of the 13?
-Yes.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.429
Dimas is wondering
if they want a plea bargain.

18:17.513 --> 18:21.016
-Has our operation been leaked?
-No way. Rigo hasn't authorized it.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.351
[cellphone vibrates]

18:22.935 --> 18:24.061
Hi, Dimas.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.105
Go on.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.274
From Estruturax?

18:29.942 --> 18:30.776
Is it set?

18:32.027 --> 18:32.986
OK. What time?

18:34.071 --> 18:35.739
OK. I'm on my way.

18:37.866 --> 18:38.992
Bye.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.161
He sent you his regards.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.205
[Cláudio scoffs, Verena laughs]

18:45.999 --> 18:47.501
[Anunciato] Championship rules.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.921
Club rules.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.465
[Verena] By "club," do you mean cartel?

18:54.424 --> 18:56.135
We call it a club.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.428
Can you state the club rules, sir?

18:59.304 --> 19:02.641
-I really can't smoke?
-Unfortunately not, sir.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.853
-If you need a break...
-[Verena] The rules.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.318
Well...

19:14.486 --> 19:16.989
...the meetings are always called
via text messages.

19:17.990 --> 19:22.327
There are never any cameras
where the meetings take place.

19:25.205 --> 19:28.458
-Tom Carvalho is always the coordinator.
-[Verena] From OSA Engineering?

19:29.084 --> 19:30.085
[Anunciato] From OSA.

19:30.878 --> 19:37.426
All Club 13 companies or "teams"
participate in the meetings.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.053
And how are the contracts
distributed among you?

19:43.056 --> 19:46.226
We list all Petrobrasil
contract opportunities...

19:46.935 --> 19:52.107
...and each team ranks its preferences,
from one to three.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.775
-[Cláudio] Each contractor?
-Yes.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.821
Then we make a chart
with each team's preferences.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.698
[Cláudio] And how do you decide?

20:00.407 --> 20:03.493
We negotiate until we reach an agreement.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.205
If we don't succeed...

20:07.915 --> 20:09.708
...the decision of the majority rules.

20:09.791 --> 20:10.792
Fair.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.461
Then there's a rule for pricing

20:12.544 --> 20:14.630
and another
in case someone steps down.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.049
Go ahead, sir.

20:17.549 --> 20:22.638
The chosen team must present its prices
and the others just bid...

20:23.180 --> 20:24.139
...as a cover.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.807
Like in every cartel.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.143
And the last one?

20:28.977 --> 20:30.604
If the chosen team...

20:30.687 --> 20:33.315
Could you stop saying "team," please?

20:36.485 --> 20:38.111
If...

20:39.655 --> 20:46.370
...the chosen contractor cannot finish
the job, for whatever reason...

20:47.204 --> 20:48.914
...it goes to the end of the line.

20:48.997 --> 20:52.376
Do you confirm you attended
several of these meetings, sir?

20:52.459 --> 20:53.585
I only missed two.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.463
[Verena] And are you able to prove
you attended these meetings?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.219
Are the minutes of any use?

21:03.804 --> 21:04.972
[Verena] Minutes?

21:06.473 --> 21:08.308
The minutes of the meetings.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.685
[Dimas coughs]

21:09.768 --> 21:11.520
They had the names of those present.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.854
[Verena] You drew up minutes?

21:14.439 --> 21:16.233
I have copies of everything.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.193
[Verena] We're going to need
those minutes.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.613
[Dimas] Mr. Anunciato, could you repeat
the names of the club members?

21:22.364 --> 21:24.491
[Dimas] And tell us about
each of their activities?

21:28.829 --> 21:32.416
Tom Carvalho from OSA,
a company based in Bahia.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.876
[Anunciato] Engineering
and infrastructure in Brazil,

21:34.960 --> 21:37.421
other Latin American countries
and Africa.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.173
Décio.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.843
Décio Correa from Carvalho Correa.

21:42.926 --> 21:47.806
A family business, they work with cement,
but also infrastructure.

21:47.889 --> 21:50.934
[Anunciato] Marcelo Rocha from TCV.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.478
An oil company that also works
with gas and energy.

21:54.062 --> 21:57.274
[Anunciato] Lourival Bueno
from Bueno Engineering.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.736
Heavyweights.

22:01.737 --> 22:05.782
[Anunciato] Luís Menezes and Pedroso

22:05.866 --> 22:07.326
from Pedroso Gonçalves.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.661
They are the biggest.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.790
Everyone knows who the biggest are.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.880
And, of course, Ricardo Bretch.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.008
-[Anunciato] But Ricardo is different.
-[Verena] Why?

22:23.091 --> 22:24.384
He's fearless.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.139
He's the only one who isn't worried
about the investigations.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.808
Why? He benefits from the cartel
as much as any other.

22:31.892 --> 22:35.270
[Anunciato] He's fearless and absolutely
sure nobody will ever catch him.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.565
His scheme is very sophisticated.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.026
According to him,
it's impossible to trace.

22:43.278 --> 22:44.446
[Verena] What's his scheme?

22:45.655 --> 22:49.076
If I knew, I would have done the same
and wouldn't be here today.

22:51.745 --> 22:52.829
May I smoke now?

22:59.211 --> 23:01.338
[Verena] <i>He confirmed the 13 names,</i>
<i>the cartel,</i>

23:01.421 --> 23:03.799
the payment of bribes
to Petrobrasil divisions.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.259
[Verena] Everyone in the same
currency-dealing scheme.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.719
[Verena] Except Ricardo Bretch.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.889
[Verena] Nothing a visit
to Miller &amp; Bretch won't solve.

23:10.972 --> 23:14.559
If we go in, we'll find what we need.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.186
And then we'll arrest Ricardo.

23:16.269 --> 23:18.063
[Guilhome] If he doesn't flee the country.

23:18.146 --> 23:19.773
It's always a risk.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.568
Anyway, these 12 are done. Half of Brazil's GDP sleeping behind bars.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.906
How does that sound?

23:27.989 --> 23:30.867
-[Vander] When do we hit the streets?
-Everything is set.

23:31.159 --> 23:34.496
[Verena] <i>Once Rigo authorizes it,</i>
<i>Operation Doomsday will hit the streets.</i>

23:34.579 --> 23:36.623
[cell door opens]

23:43.088 --> 23:44.631
FEDERAL POLICE

23:44.714 --> 23:46.675
[cell door opens]

23:48.051 --> 23:50.387
[Ibrahim] <i>They've already begun</i>
<i>emptying the cells.</i>

23:50.470 --> 23:52.389
[Ibrahim] <i>Do you know</i>
<i>where they sent Chebab?</i>

23:52.889 --> 23:54.432
[on telephone] <i>Probably Jaraguara.</i>

23:55.308 --> 23:56.309
Poor thing!

23:56.601 --> 23:59.646
[on telephone] <i>Silvério's plea bargain</i>
<i>was the final nail in the coffin.</i>

23:59.938 --> 24:02.941
<i>-I don't know how many are going down.</i>
-I need to get out.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.985
I don't want to run into any of them.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.445
[on telephone] <i> I requested</i>
<i>to expedite the house arrest.</i>

24:07.529 --> 24:09.406
I don't have a house to go to.

24:09.489 --> 24:12.367
-[Ibrahim] But it's alright.
<i>-You can buy any house you want.</i>

24:12.450 --> 24:14.077
[Ibrahim] Family, on the other hand...

24:14.161 --> 24:16.163
[Motta laughs]

24:16.246 --> 24:17.831
<i>Stella will calm down with time.</i>

24:18.415 --> 24:19.499
<i>She won't.</i>

24:19.958 --> 24:20.792
<i>And Pepê?</i>

24:21.710 --> 24:25.297
[Motta] Since his family is involved,
he has a higher price to pay.

24:26.506 --> 24:28.758
<i>He's definitely getting out. He is.</i>

24:34.973 --> 24:37.100
Not everyone is as relaxed
as you are, Ricardo.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.644
Structured Operations alone
has 14 executives.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.313
If we consider those in command,

24:41.396 --> 24:43.857
there's easily 70 executives
who may be exposed.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.483
[Ricardo] It's all been planned.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.153
[Ricardo] How many times did I hear
I was complicating things?

24:48.236 --> 24:49.779
[Ricardo] Being too demanding?

24:49.863 --> 24:51.489
[Ricardo] No one is exposed here.

24:51.573 --> 24:55.452
[Ricardo] If anyone is uncomfortable,
I'll deal with it. We'll cover it.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.412
Some are truly frightened.

24:57.495 --> 25:00.207
I was more demanding
with myself and with you.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.249
I don't regret it.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.878
Our situation here has nothing to do
with that of the other contractors.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.005
-What do we know for sure?
-Nothing yet.

25:07.088 --> 25:10.550
JPR and Ibrahim's attorneys don't know
what their clients are saying?

25:10.634 --> 25:12.302
-Are we not monitoring it?
-We are.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.221
But we can't access the plea bargains.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.641
What they said doesn't matter.
It'll be a local, restricted affair.

25:17.724 --> 25:22.103
A few contractors, the careless ones,
may eventually face some turbulence.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.188
[Ricardo] That's all.

25:23.271 --> 25:26.024
We won't. No turbulence for us!

25:26.107 --> 25:29.361
[Ricardo] Exactly. No turbulence.
There are no tracks, no loose ends.

25:29.444 --> 25:33.531
Our scheme is absolutely 100% safe.

25:34.115 --> 25:37.285
Having said that, gentlemen, I am here...

25:37.827 --> 25:40.163
...to offer to whoever so wishes
the possibility,

25:40.247 --> 25:42.791
to move to another country,

25:42.874 --> 25:44.042
at any moment.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.503
A transfer for anyone
feeling uncomfortable.

25:47.087 --> 25:50.966
[Ricardo] The company will cover all
transfer costs for you and your family.

25:51.049 --> 25:54.844
Ms. Maria Tereza is at your disposal,
if anyone is interested.

25:55.428 --> 25:58.181
Gentlemen, the decision is yours.

26:02.477 --> 26:04.854
[Ricardo] My family and I
will not be moving.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.314
[Ricardo] Good night, everyone.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.697
<i>Silvério gave them everything.</i>

26:13.780 --> 26:16.950
[The Wizard breathes heavily]

26:17.033 --> 26:18.743
How imprudent!

26:18.827 --> 26:20.412
We're depending on you, sir.

26:20.495 --> 26:21.830
[The Wizard breathes heavily]

26:21.913 --> 26:26.084
[The Wizard] At times like these,
cohesion is expected.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.670
-[The Wizard] Silvério...
-We're going to Curitiba, master.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.381
I hope they will see you.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.719
But these things
don't get resolved in Curitiba.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.973
-You think you're feeling up to it, sir?
-[woman] Absolutely not.

26:42.309 --> 26:46.229
Maybe, in a couple of days,
I'll feel well enough to travel.

26:49.899 --> 26:54.237
My plane and my pilot are waiting
for you at the airport.

26:55.905 --> 26:58.867
[Ruffo] <i>Janete's reelection</i>
<i>and Silvério's plea bargain</i>

26:58.950 --> 27:01.369
<i>complicated the situation</i>
<i>for the contractors.</i>

27:01.828 --> 27:03.913
[Ruffo] <i>They knew it was a matter of time.</i>

27:04.873 --> 27:08.293
[breathing heavily] Call Dr. Raul and
reschedule the appointment for tomorrow.

27:09.085 --> 27:11.546
[Ruffo] <i>Jet Wash was going to reach them.</i>

27:13.340 --> 27:16.634
[Ruffo] <i>The deal the Wizard had offered</i>
<i>the Attorney General</i>

27:16.718 --> 27:17.761
<i>was about to close.</i>

27:19.888 --> 27:24.309
[Ruffo] <i>Rigo needed to approve Operation</i>
<i>Doomsday before it all happened.</i>

27:25.810 --> 27:27.187
Are the requests all set?

27:27.896 --> 27:29.814
Supervising our work, Deputy? Just making sure it gets to Rigo today.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.068
Not today, Verena.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.362
But get your operation ready.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.656
-The attorneys again?
-Why are you talking to them?

27:38.740 --> 27:42.577
[Cláudio] We're not.
We've actually denied several requests.

27:42.660 --> 27:45.038
Perhaps it's a desperate wave
of plea bargains?

27:45.872 --> 27:47.374
You know what?

27:47.749 --> 27:50.877
-Let's meet with them.
-The day before we arrest their clients?

27:51.086 --> 27:53.421
If we don't see them,
they'll get suspicious.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.298
And the operation might get leaked.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.343
Meet with them,
but Ibrahim is about to be released.

27:58.426 --> 28:01.012
I'm not going to arrest him
for you to release him again.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.515
Keep an eye on him,
so he doesn't make a deal.

28:03.598 --> 28:04.724
It's for the best.

28:05.433 --> 28:07.227
[door closes]

28:10.438 --> 28:13.024
[The Wizard] <i>Put an end to it.</i>

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

28:14.609 --> 28:17.529
[The Wizard] The Curitiba prosecutors...

28:19.030 --> 28:21.074
[breathing heavily]
...have good intentions.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.910
But they are very young.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.621
They don't understand the country.

28:26.704 --> 28:28.415
A wide-ranging agreement.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.834
A sort of ground zero for corruption.

28:31.418 --> 28:34.087
It's a normal procedure
in the United States.

28:34.170 --> 28:36.464
Americans are so pragmatic.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.676
The risk involved here isn't small.

28:40.343 --> 28:43.221
We're talking about bankrupting Brazil.

28:43.304 --> 28:46.933
[woman] The sector we represent is
the main spring for the national economy.

28:47.434 --> 28:50.895
Destroying the country's economy?
What's the idea?

28:50.979 --> 28:53.732
-Who'd benefit from that?
-Nobody here wants that, right?

28:53.815 --> 28:55.233
No, of course not.

28:55.316 --> 28:58.528
We drafted up an agreement.

28:58.611 --> 29:01.948
I wrote a draft.

29:07.787 --> 29:09.873
-[Dimas] There's no need.
-It's a...

29:09.956 --> 29:11.416
This is totally irregular.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.835
It's just a draft. Take a look.

29:15.420 --> 29:19.215
[The Wizard]
<i>"The contractors admit to have been</i>

29:19.299 --> 29:24.971
in a situation of potential conflict
with legal provisions,

29:25.054 --> 29:28.308
and manifest an unequivocal disposition

29:29.225 --> 29:35.356
in collaborating with the administration
to elucidate the facts."

29:36.649 --> 29:40.612
"The contractors commit
to cease practicing acts of corruption,

29:40.695 --> 29:43.573
to cooperate fully
with all investigations,

29:43.656 --> 29:46.701
and to fully indemnify the Treasury

29:46.785 --> 29:48.870
so as to be contracted
by the government."

29:48.953 --> 29:51.498
Sorry to interrupt,
but that's not how we work.

29:51.581 --> 29:55.460
[Cláudio] Any extrajudicial agreement
is out of the question.

29:55.543 --> 29:58.171
That stance goes against
the interest of the country,

29:58.254 --> 30:02.050
the population, the hundreds of thousands
of employees who may be affected.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.093
OK. This is a first conversation.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.429
I believe we have more to cover.

30:07.180 --> 30:11.309
[woman] I trust there's a solution
that conciliates the interests at play.

30:11.392 --> 30:12.477
A consensus.

30:13.019 --> 30:15.730
An agreement is the best thing

30:15.814 --> 30:18.942
in the opinion of the brightest
legal minds in the country.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.693
Mário Garcez Brito, for example,

30:20.777 --> 30:23.029
has talked extensively to us
about this approach.

30:23.112 --> 30:24.239
Mário Garcez?

30:25.782 --> 30:27.575
-Is he representing anyone?
-No.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.953
He's been more of an advisor
to the group.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.331
[woman] He's been liaising
with the Attorney General.

30:33.414 --> 30:34.916
[woman] <i>A former Attorney General</i>

30:34.999 --> 30:37.794
<i>knows the importance</i>
<i>of maintaining a cohesive country.</i>

30:37.877 --> 30:43.883
"...in order to continue
to be contracted by the government."

30:44.759 --> 30:47.971
[he breathes heavily]

30:49.138 --> 30:54.727
An honorable way out for all parties.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.855
[The Wizard coughs heavily]

31:00.066 --> 31:01.776
[woman] <i>To make the most of our meeting,</i>

31:01.860 --> 31:03.903
let's agree on this:

31:03.987 --> 31:07.115
you commit not to take
any further decisive action...

31:07.198 --> 31:09.701
-...until we find a common denominator.
-Impossible.

31:09.784 --> 31:12.579
-Talks have evolved.
-[woman] Calm down.

31:12.662 --> 31:15.957
[man] We came here out of respect,
but the Attorney General will call you.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.668
We're just asking for a truce.

31:18.751 --> 31:22.213
Your word that nothing will happen
until we find a way out.

31:22.297 --> 31:26.134
-Unfortunately, that's not possible.
-You have our word.

31:34.225 --> 31:37.228
[The Wizard] <i>Ultimately,</i>
<i>it's a financial issue.</i>

31:37.687 --> 31:40.023
[The Wizard] <i>Millions of jobs.</i>

31:41.691 --> 31:44.986
Billions invested in infrastructure.

31:47.530 --> 31:49.115
At the end of the day,

31:49.198 --> 31:51.534
we all want the same thing.

31:52.493 --> 31:57.790
A fund to build prisons throughout Brazil
would be welcome.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.626
Exactly.

32:00.752 --> 32:01.753
Luís... ...let's go.

32:04.297 --> 32:07.342
[wheelchair rattles]

32:15.433 --> 32:16.851
[Dimas] How could you do that?

32:16.935 --> 32:18.645
-[Cláudio] They saw right through you.
-Me?

32:18.728 --> 32:21.856
-They were going to leak the operation!
-[Dimas] You're always getting ahead.

32:21.940 --> 32:25.109
-[Cláudio] I'm trying to sort things!
-[Dimas] Cláudio the problem-solver!

32:30.198 --> 32:31.449
What if it's true?

32:31.991 --> 32:34.118
You think the Attorney General
would agree?

32:34.202 --> 32:36.037
Mário Garcez is behind it! You heard.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.958
He could have convinced him
it was the best option.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.834
[Cláudio sighs]

32:42.418 --> 32:43.378
Look at this!

32:44.462 --> 32:45.546
It's ready.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.091
[Dimas fastens zip]

32:48.174 --> 32:50.176
If it's true, it's the end of Jet Wash.

32:54.847 --> 32:56.808
[opens faucet]

32:56.891 --> 32:58.726
Rigo must get the requests today.

33:01.270 --> 33:05.024
[Ruffo] <i>It was one thing to authorize</i>
<i>prison time for Ibrahim and JPR.</i>

33:05.608 --> 33:08.236
[Ruffo] <i>It was another altogether</i>
<i>to authorize an operation</i>

33:08.319 --> 33:11.072
<i>to arrest 13 of the biggest</i>
<i>contractors in the country.</i>

33:11.280 --> 33:13.783
[Vanessa] Don't wake me up
when you go to bed.

33:13.866 --> 33:15.243
I'm not going to bed.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.995
That much stuff?

33:17.245 --> 33:19.330
It's not about quantity. It's about who.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.751
[Rigo types on keyboard]

33:23.835 --> 33:25.086
There's no turning back.

[Rigo sighs]

33:33.803 --> 33:36.014
[Rigo types]

34:09.505 --> 34:10.465
[Cláudio] Well?

34:12.675 --> 34:13.885
[Dimas] Nothing.

34:13.967 --> 34:15.344
[Cláudio] It's a lot of requests.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.472
[Cláudio] Rigo is fast,
but he's only human.

34:17.554 --> 34:20.850
-[Dimas] We need reinforcement, Cláudio.
-[Cláudio] Relax. Have some coffee.

34:20.933 --> 34:23.268
[Dimas] Do you have any idea
what's going to happen?

34:23.978 --> 34:26.397
It's us against the biggest
law firms in the country.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.733
[Cláudio] We need a bigger team.
There's no other way.

-[Cláudio] What?
-We're to go to Brasília.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.869
[Dimas breathes deeply]

34:39.952 --> 34:41.036
So, it's settled.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.081
Mário must have convinced him.

34:47.835 --> 34:49.003
[Dimas] What are you doing?

34:50.963 --> 34:52.757
[Cláudio] Writing my resignation letter.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.844
[Cláudio] If he decided for it...

34:57.553 --> 34:59.222
...I'm not staying here a day longer.

[João] So?

35:43.724 --> 35:46.644
-It's an easy job for us.
-How long will it take?

35:47.270 --> 35:51.190
A day, if we start early,
my grandson and I.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.275
Great.

35:52.358 --> 35:54.485
Can you replace it with the same pipe?

35:54.569 --> 35:57.738
It's the most common type.
A standard pipe.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.491
-How much will it be?
-Six hundred.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.578
Six hundred to replace a pipe?

36:03.661 --> 36:04.954
[João mutters]

36:05.037 --> 36:06.414
It will cost me a lot.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.708
You said it'll take you a day.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.418
It will.

36:10.501 --> 36:13.713
But there's the material,
some change for my grandson.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.131
Fine.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.008
How much for the pipe?

36:18.217 --> 36:20.469
I can get it for around 80.

36:21.721 --> 36:24.307
So, you're charging me
520 for a day's work?

I wish!

36:27.435 --> 36:29.937
[Ruffo] I'm sorry, I don't understand
your math, Mr. João.

36:30.771 --> 36:32.565
Fifty for the grandson.

36:32.648 --> 36:35.359
One hundred and fifty for my daily rate.
That's 200.

36:35.443 --> 36:36.986
Right. There's 300 left.

36:38.487 --> 36:42.074
Three hundred for the guy
that referred me.

36:43.910 --> 36:44.911
Who's that?

36:46.787 --> 36:48.247
[João] Didn't you get my card?

36:52.335 --> 36:53.586
Do you mean...

36:54.587 --> 36:57.089
Alfredo? The Sanesul employee?

36:57.173 --> 36:59.800
[João] Alfredo. But Alfredo, poor guy...

37:00.384 --> 37:02.386
...he doesn't get to keep it all.

37:02.470 --> 37:06.682
He takes his cut,
but he has to pay his boss, right?

37:07.058 --> 37:10.102
But it's better to get the job done
than not get it done.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.729
[João] Shall we?

37:16.943 --> 37:18.819
[elevator bell rings]

37:25.326 --> 37:27.203
[Cláudio] The Attorney General
called us in.

They did it.
They're going to halt Jet Wash.

-[Verena] No, nothing.

What do you see?

39:13.225 --> 39:15.353
Your doctor will talk to you.

39:15.811 --> 39:18.564
You're seeing what's wrong.
Why won't you just tell me?

39:18.939 --> 39:20.608
Because that's not my job.

39:20.691 --> 39:23.694
-Oh, really?
-No, it's your doctor's job.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.614
You already know what's wrong. Tell me!

39:27.198 --> 39:29.116
[doctor] That's not the procedure.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.326
"Procedure"!

39:31.285 --> 39:32.620
Is that it?

39:33.412 --> 39:34.372
[doctor] That's it.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.214
[doctor] Do you want me to call someone?

39:46.634 --> 39:47.635
No.

40:05.277 --> 40:06.570
[Regina] What are you doing?

40:07.029 --> 40:08.781
Fixing it my way.

40:08.864 --> 40:11.617
-A temporary permanent solution.
-[Regina] What about Sanesul?

40:12.201 --> 40:14.745
[Ruffo] I called them,
but they said two to three weeks.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.707
-Mr. João would take a day.
-Who's Mr. João?

40:23.421 --> 40:24.422
MR. JOÃO

40:24.505 --> 40:26.757
[Ruffo] <i>Mr. João, Alfredo,</i>

40:26.841 --> 40:30.553
<i>Ibrahim, João Pedro Rangel,</i>
<i>Mário Garcez Brito...</i>

40:31.053 --> 40:32.555
<i>...all sick.</i>

40:40.521 --> 40:42.022
[Ruffo] <i>Cancer is a disease</i>

40:42.106 --> 40:45.693
<i>caused by a failure in the regulation</i>
<i>of cell growth in our bodies.</i>

40:49.405 --> 40:52.908
[Ruffo] <i>Almost all cases are caused</i>
<i>by environmental factors.</i>

40:57.246 --> 41:01.125
[Ruffo] <i>It can spread from its original</i>
<i>location and affect the entire body.</i>

41:01.584 --> 41:03.502
[Ruffo] <i>That is what's called metastasis.</i>

41:06.338 --> 41:07.339
[drilling]

41:21.896 --> 41:24.398
[Ruffo] <i>Even with</i>
<i>all the treatment available...</i>

41:25.816 --> 41:28.360
<i>...cancer fights to stay alive.</i>

41:31.989 --> 41:35.201
[Ruffo] <i>And most of the time, it wins.</i>

41:41.707 --> 41:45.252
[Ruffo] <i>When there's no exact understanding</i>
<i>of how a disease works</i>

41:45.336 --> 41:46.962
<i>and where it can spread...</i>

41:47.671 --> 41:49.590
<i>...there's no way of finding a cure.</i>

41:55.095 --> 41:56.388
MR. JOÃO

41:59.558 --> 42:01.185
[Ruffo] <i>That is my mission...</i>

42:02.102 --> 42:03.646
<i>...to decipher the mechanism.</i>

42:05.147 --> 42:07.441
