- I'm sorry, honey.

01:53.848 --> 01:54.713
- I know.

02:01.789 --> 02:02.688
Coffee?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.324
- Thank you.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.959
- You are gonna do great today.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.961
I am so proud of you.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.399
Call me as soon as
you get the good news.

02:15.936 --> 02:16.835
- I will.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.570
Goodbye.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.674
- John.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.450
- I
want you to relax.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.818
Breathe in deeply.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.654
Breathe out fear.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.323
Breathe in strength.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.527
You're a strong individual.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.196
You deserve success.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.032
Breathe in strength.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.701
Breathe out fear.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.939
You can accomplish anything
you put your mind to.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.419
- Hey.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.258
If you can't see my face--

03:13.260 --> 03:14.193
yeah.

03:14.195 --> 03:15.427
If you can't see my face,

03:15.429 --> 03:17.629
you're looking in
the wrong direction.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.064
All right.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.300
The company has announced
the date of our IPO.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.239
With a little bit more
enthusiasm, please.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.343
No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:31.345 --> 03:35.447
March 15th, three days from now,

03:36.517 --> 03:39.318
our little company will
be doing big things,

03:39.320 --> 03:43.589
trading in all the major
markets in the world.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.927
Because of me.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.797
- To our fearless leader, Greg.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.867
To Gregory Duncan who
we owe everything to.

04:01.108 --> 04:04.109
- And just as any great army
has the guidance of a general,

04:04.111 --> 04:07.246
we owe so much to the men
who fight in the trenches.

04:07.248 --> 04:10.148
He's to our captain,
John Macbeth.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.245
- I'm really
scared, love.

05:13.247 --> 05:14.646
- Look, you have
never been pregnant before.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.480
You don't know.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.381
- Oh, God!

05:18.185 --> 05:19.584
Oh, God!

05:19.586 --> 05:20.419
Oh, God!

05:20.421 --> 05:21.653
Love, oh, God!

05:44.978 --> 05:46.445
- Janice!

05:46.447 --> 05:47.312
- Jane.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.146
- Yeah.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.581
How are you?

05:49.583 --> 05:50.515
- I'm well.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.317
- I'm about ready to pop.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.355
I thought you weren't
home for a second.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.357
I'm standing out here thinking,

05:58.359 --> 06:01.860
I thought she was a stay
at home wife or whatever.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.063
Oh, my God, this heat though.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.932
- Yes, it's--

06:06.934 --> 06:08.300
- So did
you try the quiche?

06:08.302 --> 06:09.134
- Oh!

06:09.136 --> 06:09.968
- Yeah, how was it?

06:09.970 --> 06:10.802
- It was--

06:10.804 --> 06:11.837
- The texture, right?

06:12.806 --> 06:14.706
I know.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.974
- Yeah, yeah.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.075
I have it if you--

06:17.077 --> 06:18.243
- The dish?

06:18.245 --> 06:19.077
- Yeah,

06:19.079 --> 06:20.011
- Did you clean it out?

06:20.013 --> 06:20.946
Oh, it's okay if you haven't.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.781
You can bring it back whenever.

06:22.783 --> 06:23.815
No, really.
- I have it if you would,

06:23.817 --> 06:26.585
right now.
- No, so I was coming by

06:26.587 --> 06:30.021
just to remind you of my
bool club discussion tonight.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.190
You know, the one I
talked to you about

06:32.192 --> 06:33.525
with my girls from work.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.326
- Oh, sure.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.427
- Great!

06:35.429 --> 06:36.661
Well, consider this

06:36.663 --> 06:39.164
your official welcome
to the neighborhood.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.366
We're reading Kerouac.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.405
- Wow, that's wonderful.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.839
- I know!

06:47.841 --> 06:48.740
- Mm-hmm.

06:50.477 --> 06:53.178
- So I expect you
there, six p.m.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.946
On the dot, Lady Macbeth.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.381
- Yes.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.583
- And bring that dish
and conversation.

07:00.421 --> 07:01.219
- Six.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.053
- Okay.

07:02.055 --> 07:02.954
- All right.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.226
- No, no, I understand.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.196
I understand completely, but
you gotta listen to me, Gains.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.565
Gains, baby, listen to me, okay?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.300
The numbers are solid, okay.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.736
I'm talking they're
borderline bulletproof.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.704
Why don't you go get some
champagne or something?

07:23.243 --> 07:24.142
What, what?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.610
Am I sure?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.145
Am I sure?

07:27.147 --> 07:28.180
Don't you trust me?

07:29.516 --> 07:31.049
To trust me is to love
me, and I know I love you.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.083
Don't you love me?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.587
I tell you what,
I tell you what.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.822
Here we go.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.057
If the numbers come in
the way I say they will,

07:39.059 --> 07:42.461
you, Braddock and Hudlow,
you gotta caddy for me

07:42.463 --> 07:44.062
next time we hit the greens

07:44.064 --> 07:47.232
in leather bikinis
and six-inch heels.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.467
But not Hudlow though,

07:48.469 --> 07:50.535
'cause that shit would
just be disgusting.

07:50.537 --> 07:51.770
Okay.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.405
We're still doing drinks
in the new boat, yeah?

07:54.174 --> 07:55.407
Okay, all right.

07:55.409 --> 07:56.808
Let me go ahead
and do that shit.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.944
I mean, you know, the money's
not gonna make itself.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.345
All right, bye-bye.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.148
- German?

08:04.585 --> 08:05.484
- Yeah.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.353
But it is what it is.

08:08.355 --> 08:09.855
I do some working of my own.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.993
So what can I do you for?

08:16.396 --> 08:19.931
- Well, for one, I think we
should keep the celebrating

08:19.933 --> 08:22.868
to a minimum until the
IPO actually goes through.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.504
We have so many employees,
so many different factors.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.473
Too much chatter could
affect the stock price.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.409
- Look, you said the
fundamentals are strong.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.744
The people are excited.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.212
Let 'em get excited, man.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.514
Let them tweet a book
to all their friends,

08:35.515 --> 08:36.982
tell them how we're
the next big thing.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.582
- I am fairly certain

08:38.585 --> 08:41.152
the SEC would disagree
with that policy.

08:42.155 --> 08:42.988
- Oh, shit.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.188
I tell you what.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.690
Look, let me worry
about that, all right?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.893
I wanna talk about something
really, really important.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.028
- Okay.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.531
- Remember Jackie?

08:54.134 --> 08:55.567
- No.

08:55.569 --> 08:56.801
- The blonde that I brought by

08:56.803 --> 08:58.270
like two weeks ago
with the arthritis.

08:58.272 --> 08:59.905
Well, actually, we thought
they were big titties,

08:59.907 --> 09:01.139
but when she took them off,

09:01.141 --> 09:02.474
they looked like those
African tribal titties.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.242
We call the bitch flapjack.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.844
We caught her stealing
all the fucking paperclips

09:05.846 --> 09:06.711
out of Margaret's office.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.879
- Yes, yes.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.448
- Anyway, this
bitch just texted me

09:10.450 --> 09:12.083
saying she wants to
come by the office.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.786
She'll do anything to get a
little bit of that

09:14.788 --> 09:16.154
on the fucking conference table.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.456
She will such my
dick from the back.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.691
And I ain't never had nobody

09:19.693 --> 09:21.059
suck my dick from
the back before.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.128
That shit might be worth
a box of paperclips.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.029
Feel me?

09:25.732 --> 09:26.631
- Yeah.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.532
- All right.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.301
You can go.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.971
- There's actually
one other thing.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.074
- What's that?

09:37.144 --> 09:38.176
- Well, okay.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.212
Since the IPO is going forward

09:41.214 --> 09:44.649
and profits were 8%
above expectations,

09:46.653 --> 09:48.420
I'm wondering, can
I tell my wife?

09:50.424 --> 09:51.590
- Tell your wife what?

09:57.230 --> 09:59.764
- At my review,

09:59.765 --> 10:02.299
we discussed the progress that
we made, the work I had done,

10:03.403 --> 10:04.769
the Connor contracts
which I put together.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.705
- Hey, that was a
team effort, John.

10:09.643 --> 10:14.079
- At that meeting, I
was told that if the IPO

10:14.081 --> 10:15.747
did go through and the
company were profitable,

10:15.749 --> 10:18.583
that I would be made head of
the international division

10:18.585 --> 10:20.552
along with an
increase in salary.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.088
Can I tell my wife?

10:24.658 --> 10:26.257
- I gotta be honest with you.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.359
I went to the board.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.696
Unfortunately, that's
not gonna happen.

10:31.698 --> 10:32.664
Look, look, look.

10:32.666 --> 10:33.665
I went to bat for you.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.699
Don't you trust me?

10:36.003 --> 10:37.502
- Yeah.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.603
- To trust me to love me,
and I know I love you.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.537
Don't you love me?

10:41.074 --> 10:43.608
But with the secrecy involved
and the government contracts

10:43.610 --> 10:47.746
and the drone program, they
just felt like leaving matters

10:47.748 --> 10:50.415
with the international
division was best in my hands.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.550
But I tell you what.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.287
I'm proud of you, and you
should be proud of you.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.358
With the work you did,
removing the security cameras

11:00.360 --> 11:01.626
and replacing it with that

11:01.628 --> 11:03.695
neighbors watching
neighbors policy,

11:03.697 --> 11:05.597
that was genius.

11:05.599 --> 11:07.132
That saved us all
kinds of money,

11:07.134 --> 11:09.601
made us look great to the board.

11:09.603 --> 11:13.538
Gains, when I was on
the phone, she said it.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.473
She was like, "Dude,
it's fucking awesome!"

11:19.446 --> 11:22.247
And another thing too,
about the salary increase.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.716
Salaries are gonna be locked
for like the next year.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.086
Look, with things
going on right now

11:28.088 --> 11:32.023
and how shit is all shifty
about the IPO, they wanna see

11:32.025 --> 11:36.261
that we're a lean, mean
profit-making machine, right?

11:36.263 --> 11:39.030
So in order to do that, we can't
do any superfluous spending

11:39.032 --> 11:43.268
on salary increases and,
you know, shit like that.

11:44.905 --> 11:45.737
- But

11:49.042 --> 11:51.209
you just bought the
whole office champagne.

11:55.749 --> 11:56.614
- Yeah.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.084
Champagne is cheap, John.

12:02.989 --> 12:08.059
But I gotta get this text
back over to Jackie, so.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.097
- Jane, you came.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.066
Oh.

12:17.370 --> 12:21.139
You should have used
my dish.

12:21.141 --> 12:25.443
Ladies, this is Jane,
my new neighbor.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.079
She and her husband--

12:28.081 --> 12:28.913
- John.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.515
- Yeah.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.518
I took them the quiche to
welcome them to the neighborhood.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.120
- Oh, the quiche, you say.

12:35.122 --> 12:39.057
- Yeah, to welcome them to
the neighborhood.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.360
So I thought she'd like
to join us, so come in.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.700
- A baby beanbag.

12:48.702 --> 12:51.202
- Oh, what the hell
is a baby beanbag?

12:51.204 --> 12:54.072
- Just like what it
sounds like, stupid.

12:54.908 --> 12:55.874
Oh, yeah, hee-hee-hee.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.443
Laugh all you want, Alma, okay?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.644
But it was super comfy.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.446
And weren't it pretty
nice, huh, Mary?

13:01.448 --> 13:02.614
Pretty nice.

13:04.651 --> 13:05.550
Whatever.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.319
Whatever.
- Okay.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.822
Why doesn't anyone ever throw
parties for us single ladies?

13:10.824 --> 13:12.957
- Oh, what would
we get you, condoms?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.592
'Cause we know
you don't use 'em.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.494
- My vibrator's
monogamous, honey.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.762
But you never know.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.799
If I met a man worth the
bam, I might need them.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.601
- What about you, Jan?

13:23.603 --> 13:24.502
- Jane.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.306
- I'm sorry, Jane.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.177
What about you?

13:32.179 --> 13:33.411
- Yeah, are we gonna throw you

13:33.413 --> 13:35.847
a book club meeting/baby
shower any time soon?

13:39.352 --> 13:40.618
- What would you like?

13:40.620 --> 13:45.523
- Uh, I'm, I don't, um...

13:58.138 --> 13:59.370
- Oh, my God!

13:59.372 --> 14:00.905
Jenny, did you see
the new baby gift bag

14:00.907 --> 14:02.340
that Andrea gave me?

14:03.109 --> 14:04.609
- Which one?

14:04.611 --> 14:06.010
- Oh, I don't know
which company it's from.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.912
- No, which Andrea.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.448
Andrea, I can't stand
that bitch, Andrea?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.450
Or Andrea booty doody?

14:12.452 --> 14:13.384
- Booty doody?

14:13.386 --> 14:15.019
- What's booty do?

14:15.021 --> 14:17.722
- Her stomach is so fat
that it sticks out further--

14:17.724 --> 14:19.457
Than her booty do.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.051
- Hi.

14:48.622 --> 14:49.520
Stephen?

14:50.523 --> 14:51.356
- Yeah.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.724
- Hi.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.791
- Jane, right?

14:58.098 --> 15:02.066
How's the book club thing
working out for you?

15:02.068 --> 15:05.603
- It's not.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.039
- Please don't
tell Mary I said that.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.507
- Oh, no.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.109
That's our little secret.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.122
- You want a beer or something?

15:24.124 --> 15:25.556
- Yes, sure.

15:26.860 --> 15:31.329
It feels like a
beer kind of day.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.625
You're about to
be a father, huh.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.460
- Yeah.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.128
- Mm-hmm.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.597
- Yes, I am, yep.

16:08.802 --> 16:09.701
Yep.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.270
Yep.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.610
- You can't go
on maternity leave.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.046
- Well, it's kinda too late now.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.049
Thanks to my man here.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.051
- Yeah.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.429
- So that's where
you got to, Jane.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.332
I thought you had
left for a second.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.736
See, there's no
reason to worry here.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.875
Come in and help me serve
these ravenous bitches.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.145
- Bye, Jane.

16:57.617 --> 16:58.516
- Another beer?

17:00.453 --> 17:01.586
- I am, I'm fine.

17:01.588 --> 17:02.487
Thank you.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.040
- It's not
the end of the world.

17:23.376 --> 17:27.345
- Yeah, but maybe it's
the end of this one, huh.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.147
What am I gonna
tell her, Margaret?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.216
- She's gonna have
to understand.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.951
It's not your fault.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.220
- That's not important.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.360
We can't afford the house.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.997
We were counting on
the raise, and now,

17:49.235 --> 17:52.003
damn it, you know.

17:52.005 --> 17:56.441
- We're gonna get through this.

17:56.443 --> 18:00.178
I mean, you're gonna
get through it.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.780
I'll see if there's
something I can do to help.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.083
- No, no, no, no.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.752
I can't ask you to
do that, all right?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.153
This is my problem.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.090
I'll deal.

18:28.675 --> 18:29.574
- Macbeth.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.510
- Yeah?

18:32.512 --> 18:33.411
- Clio.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.446
- Yeah.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.347
- Yeah.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.651
Polly, Calliope and I have
been hearing some rumors.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.789
- Yeah?

18:44.791 --> 18:48.626
Yeah, that you'll be
running the company soon.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.161
- Getting all the glory.

18:50.163 --> 18:50.995
- Mm-hmm.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.331
- Want me.

18:53.333 --> 18:57.168
- Probably not the kind
of thing I need right now.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.637
- Well, this is the only
kind of thing you ever need.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.308
- Okay, okay,
let's get you home.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.644
- Oh, his home or yours?

19:10.917 --> 19:12.783
He will get the glory,

19:12.785 --> 19:16.921
but you won't be the woman
by his side when he does.

19:16.923 --> 19:17.889
- Nope.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.390
- Sold out.

19:19.392 --> 19:24.362
- Sold out down the river,
river of red, red, red.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.699
- Let's go, Margaret.

19:30.970 --> 19:36.040
- See you around.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.396
- Tell me what to do.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.473
Oh, shit!

21:28.087 --> 21:29.220
- Ta-da!

21:29.222 --> 21:30.554
Oh, my God!

21:30.556 --> 21:32.390
What happened to you?

21:37.997 --> 21:38.896
Aw.

21:44.203 --> 21:46.337
The news of this coming out.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.607
I mean, they can't
help but give you

21:49.609 --> 21:51.108
the promotion that
they promised you.

21:51.110 --> 21:54.512
You can't very well
celebrate success

21:54.514 --> 21:57.415
and not reward the
people who caused it

21:57.417 --> 22:00.351
and just thank you for
about this house.

22:00.353 --> 22:03.821
You were worried we weren't
gonna be able to afford it.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.056
- Jane.

22:05.058 --> 22:06.223
- We're gonna
take that vacation

22:06.225 --> 22:07.425
we've been planning
for Scotland.

22:07.427 --> 22:08.659
And I know it's--
- Jane.

22:10.296 --> 22:11.128
Jane!

22:11.130 --> 22:12.029
- Yes.

22:14.267 --> 22:15.166
- You can.

22:17.437 --> 22:21.872
You can celebrate success
and not reward it.

22:27.947 --> 22:28.846
There,

22:32.785 --> 22:34.685
there is no promotion.

22:38.291 --> 22:39.256
Fuck!

22:39.258 --> 22:43.494
♪ Project sleep machine ♪

22:43.496 --> 22:47.098
♪ The consequences, unclear ♪

22:47.100 --> 22:48.165
- I'm sorry.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.042
I'm sick of this world.

23:02.081 --> 23:07.151
I'm sick of watching these
corporate cunts succeed

23:08.855 --> 23:10.921
while we beg for scraps,

23:12.592 --> 23:14.158
while we eat shit.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.796
- John, it'll be all right.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.464
- Oh, really?

23:20.466 --> 23:21.832
Will it be all right?

23:24.170 --> 23:25.069
Tell me why.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.873
Because we're good people?

23:32.412 --> 23:33.310
Yeah.

23:34.814 --> 23:35.780
And things,

23:38.785 --> 23:42.019
things always magically
work out for good people.

23:47.393 --> 23:50.194
Good people get sodomized
by this system, Jane.

23:52.031 --> 23:56.634
The American dream, there it is.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.403
It's what we see when
we close our eyes

24:00.506 --> 24:04.241
while we're biting
our pillow.

24:06.913 --> 24:07.812
- John.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.917
- It's a goddamn world.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.691
Tell me what to do.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.763
Tell me what to do.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.935
Tell me what to do.

24:34.040 --> 24:34.939
Jane,

24:39.512 --> 24:40.411
tell me.

24:50.523 --> 24:51.755
What can I do?

25:02.802 --> 25:04.034
Tell me what to do.

25:07.473 --> 25:08.772
Tell me what to do.

25:08.774 --> 25:09.673
- Shh.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.410
What about the Japanese deal,

25:17.517 --> 25:22.586
the one that just went away
and cost the company 100,000?

25:26.926 --> 25:28.726
John, what happened there?

25:42.842 --> 25:46.644
- I guess I could
always.

25:50.249 --> 25:55.319
We're going public.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.429
- This world owes us.

26:09.468 --> 26:12.202
- Whether it does or it doesn't,

26:13.272 --> 26:15.272
I'm taking what's ours.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.292
- Hi, Stephen.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.460
Is Mary home?

28:17.863 --> 28:21.298
I didn't realize last night was
more of a baby shower thing,

28:21.300 --> 28:24.735
so I brought this.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.303
- Mary will be back in a couple.

28:26.305 --> 28:29.273
I mean, if you wanna come in.

28:30.576 --> 28:31.842
- Sure.

28:31.844 --> 28:32.743
- Yeah.

28:40.453 --> 28:41.351
I'm sorry.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.955
You shouldn't have to see this.

28:44.957 --> 28:45.856
It's just...

28:49.128 --> 28:53.597
It's just that we're
both housewives.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.902
I mean, she doesn't
even fuckin' see me.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.405
She doesn't even fuckin'
see me, you know.

29:29.568 --> 29:30.901
- Stephen.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.136
Stephen.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.036
Stephen.

29:34.073 --> 29:34.972
Stephen.

29:36.308 --> 29:38.342
Stephen!

29:38.344 --> 29:39.676
- I just want to--

29:39.678 --> 29:41.745
- Stephen.

29:41.747 --> 29:42.646
Stephen.

29:44.683 --> 29:45.582
Stephen!

29:59.799 --> 30:00.731
Where were you?

30:00.733 --> 30:03.467
Whoa, what happened to you?

30:08.440 --> 30:09.706
Where were you?

30:13.479 --> 30:15.679
No, don't sit there.

30:15.681 --> 30:16.547
I just cleaned.

30:16.549 --> 30:17.447
Go.

30:24.023 --> 30:24.922
John.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.526
What happened with Duncan?

30:35.734 --> 30:36.600
- He's gone.

30:37.703 --> 30:39.436
- What, on another
damn vacation?

30:53.052 --> 30:54.618
- Double check
some fitters for me.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.554
- What are you looking for?

30:57.556 --> 30:58.422
- Discrepancies.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.289
- Kyoto?

31:01.927 --> 31:03.160
You're looking to
dig a grave for him.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.461
I get it.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.897
But at this rate, you're
gonna have to dig two.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.832
- It's the only play I've got.

31:13.606 --> 31:16.373
I know that you leak
sensitive information

31:16.375 --> 31:17.741
to drive the stock price down

31:17.743 --> 31:19.476
so you could buy
it up privately.

31:20.846 --> 31:25.115
The Kyoto deal, where we
happened to lose 100 grand

31:25.117 --> 31:27.818
that we paid upfront
to a local company

31:27.820 --> 31:31.655
to help us negotiate, a
company that you happen to be

31:31.657 --> 31:32.923
the primary shareholder.

31:34.260 --> 31:38.128
Now, all those losses over
the years, almost $1 million.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.898
Now with our pathetic IPO,

31:42.401 --> 31:44.635
that will let you buy
what, 200,000 shares?

31:46.305 --> 31:48.572
Maybe enough to make you
the primary shareholder.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.510
- Yeah, big word.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.250
Captain, captain, my captain.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.586
Walking your fucking
ass into my office

32:02.588 --> 32:05.255
like you're the big swinging
dick around this motherfucker,

32:05.257 --> 32:06.990
a King Kong or something.

32:06.992 --> 32:08.926
I'm King Kong, motherfucker!

32:08.928 --> 32:11.128
I'm the big black swinging dick!

32:21.507 --> 32:23.573
Get your fucking ass up!

32:30.849 --> 32:33.650
So is that what
it is, John, huh?

32:54.606 --> 32:55.472
Oh, shit!

33:05.084 --> 33:06.350
I'm King Kong's dick.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.690
- Now then, seems about right.

34:03.642 --> 34:04.541
- Really?

34:11.183 --> 34:12.649
That's wonderful.

34:34.373 --> 34:35.272
We can't,

34:36.542 --> 34:39.042
we can't get everything
that we want.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.813
But if we try,

34:45.617 --> 34:47.451
we get what we need.

34:49.154 --> 34:52.121
And this is what we need, John.

35:00.666 --> 35:05.168
John.

36:02.594 --> 36:03.493
- Jane?

36:10.669 --> 36:12.502
- I want to punish Stephen.

36:14.439 --> 36:15.338
- Who?

36:20.612 --> 36:24.214
- Mary, the neighbor,
her husband.

36:26.685 --> 36:27.584
- Why?

36:28.654 --> 36:32.722
- He's scum, and he deserves it.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.562
- What did he do?

36:40.299 --> 36:42.632
- I want to hurt him.

36:50.842 --> 36:58.915
You just did an amazing and
difficult thing for our family.

37:04.256 --> 37:05.722
Now it's my turn.

37:07.859 --> 37:12.929
I want to show him that
there are consequences.

37:17.769 --> 37:18.835
- All right.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.271
Wait for me.

37:25.143 --> 37:26.042
- My man.

37:59.378 --> 38:00.176
- Thanks, hon.

38:00.178 --> 38:01.044
- Mm-hmm.

38:07.152 --> 38:09.219
Hmm, here.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.260
- Remember, wait for me.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.496
- I'll try.

38:22.234 --> 38:24.401
- Have a good day, honey.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.543

reached the Seytons.

40:22.487 --> 40:24.320
We can't come to
the phone right now,

40:24.322 --> 40:26.156
so please leave a message.

40:27.459 --> 40:32.262
- Hi, Stephen, Mary,
it's Jane from next door.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.232
I was calling,

40:37.936 --> 40:40.703
I wanted to know what
you thought of the--

40:40.705 --> 40:41.604
- Jane?

40:43.442 --> 40:44.274
Jane?

40:44.276 --> 40:45.275
- Hi, Stephen.

40:47.345 --> 40:49.112
- Mary
and I love the toy.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.252
- I was thinking about--

40:56.254 --> 40:58.621
- Hang up and I'll
see you up front.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.009
- You Malcolm Duncan?

41:22.347 --> 41:23.746
- Yeah.

41:23.748 --> 41:26.049
- I need to talk to
you about your uncle.

42:12.564 --> 42:13.563
The pacifier.

42:15.433 --> 42:16.332
- Oh.

42:17.702 --> 42:18.535
Yeah, yeah.

42:18.537 --> 42:20.403
We, I loved it.

42:24.709 --> 42:28.945
Hey, what are we doing here?

42:32.384 --> 42:34.851
- Nothing yet.

42:38.356 --> 42:43.426
- Yeah, I was drunk.

42:49.501 --> 42:50.867
- How about now?

43:09.654 --> 43:11.955
- Are we really doing this?

43:23.401 --> 43:25.902
- That's enough from you now.

43:25.904 --> 43:26.803
- Oh.

43:30.342 --> 43:31.240
Really?

43:38.717 --> 43:39.616
Here.

43:46.091 --> 43:49.626
This is my cellphone.

43:51.363 --> 43:53.329
You don't have to
call the house, huh.

43:59.771 --> 44:03.039
- Is she home?

44:05.610 --> 44:08.778
- No, but she will be.

44:21.226 --> 44:25.628
- What will she
think about this,

44:27.399 --> 44:30.466
about you coming
on to me like this?

44:35.173 --> 44:37.640
- Why would she have to know?

44:39.911 --> 44:43.980
- Well, someone,

44:45.583 --> 44:49.419
someone could show
her the security feed

44:49.421 --> 44:51.287
that's on us right now.

44:53.925 --> 44:56.893
The footage from the
security cam is being sent

44:56.895 --> 44:59.796
to a security firm,

45:01.466 --> 45:05.101
with a copy sent to
me too, of course.

45:07.972 --> 45:08.871
- Wait,

45:10.041 --> 45:10.940
what?

45:13.845 --> 45:16.345
- What's the matter, Stephen?

45:17.749 --> 45:19.982
You don't like the
idea of being watched,

45:21.119 --> 45:23.186
that at any moment,
your wife could find out

45:23.188 --> 45:25.822
what you've been
wanting to do with me?

45:25.824 --> 45:28.591
- Yeah, fuck.

45:28.593 --> 45:31.027
- This isn't the
first time, is it?

45:32.130 --> 45:34.831
No, it can't be, a big
strapping man like you.

45:36.101 --> 45:37.100
There are others.

45:37.102 --> 45:38.000
Jenny?

45:39.871 --> 45:40.770
Alma?

45:42.140 --> 45:43.039
Alicia?

45:44.309 --> 45:46.609
Your wife has to know.

45:46.611 --> 45:49.212
Well, suspect at least.

45:51.950 --> 45:53.549
You've got a baby on the way.

45:54.619 --> 45:56.452
God, the baby.

45:58.223 --> 46:01.557
You better have a
damn good lawyer,

46:02.927 --> 46:07.263
you know, self-sacrificing
mother, high stress job,

46:09.100 --> 46:11.267
supporting a family
all by herself.

46:13.938 --> 46:17.406
You should be out job
hunting, building that resume.

46:19.711 --> 46:23.780
You've got a family
to support, for now.

46:27.719 --> 46:31.154
- Tread lightly, Jane.

46:31.156 --> 46:35.925
- I will tread however the
fuck I want to, Stephen.

46:37.428 --> 46:38.861
Would you look at the time.

46:38.863 --> 46:40.263
You should be going.

46:42.634 --> 46:44.901
Tell Mary I'll be
over in a bit, okay?

46:48.373 --> 46:49.272
Bye.

46:56.915 --> 46:57.814
- Malcolm.

47:00.785 --> 47:01.684
- Hey, John.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.923
- Your uncle in yet?

47:06.925 --> 47:09.192
- No, not yet.

47:09.194 --> 47:12.762
He asked me to meet him
here early and never showed.

47:13.832 --> 47:15.865
There's a detective here though.

47:16.668 --> 47:18.167
- Detective?

47:18.169 --> 47:19.135
Why?

47:20.305 --> 47:21.737
- I don't know.

47:21.739 --> 47:23.105
Maybe about him.

47:23.942 --> 47:25.875
The news is outside.

47:25.877 --> 47:27.810
- Okay.

47:27.812 --> 47:29.412
Okay.

47:29.414 --> 47:34.116
Well, I got a lot
of paperwork so--

47:34.118 --> 47:36.953
- Want me to tell my Uncle
Greg you stopped in to see him?

47:38.890 --> 47:41.190
- Yeah, yeah, thanks.

47:41.192 --> 47:43.860
Do that for me, appreciate it.

48:07.886 --> 48:08.951
- Who is it?

48:10.955 --> 48:15.458
- It's just the phone company
making sure I pay my bill.

48:16.895 --> 48:17.760
- Okay.

48:19.330 --> 48:20.897
My credit card is in my purse.

48:24.068 --> 48:25.234
You can use it, honey.

48:26.471 --> 48:27.837
I don't want you to
miss a job opportunity

48:27.839 --> 48:29.138
because of a disconnected

48:31.676 --> 48:32.742
- All right.

48:33.511 --> 48:34.410
Thanks, babe.

48:36.915 --> 48:39.548
I'm almost finished up
here. i'll be right in, yeah.

48:49.727 --> 48:50.626
Oh, fuck.

48:59.837 --> 49:00.970
- Yes?

49:00.972 --> 49:02.371
- Hey, hon.

49:02.373 --> 49:03.306
Cops are here.

49:04.409 --> 49:06.208
- Well, that's to
be expected, dear.

49:08.212 --> 49:09.812
Did they say why?

49:11.516 --> 49:12.949
- 'Cause we killed Duncan.

49:14.352 --> 49:16.252
- Did they tell you
that's why they're there?

49:16.254 --> 49:17.720
- No.

49:17.722 --> 49:18.854
- Well, then why do you assume

49:18.856 --> 49:20.423
that that's why they're there?

49:25.263 --> 49:27.363
- Because we're being paranoid.

49:28.499 --> 49:30.499
- You're being silly, dear.

49:33.237 --> 49:35.871
Now I need you to still yourself

49:37.208 --> 49:40.343
and be my confident,
charming man.

49:45.083 --> 49:45.982
- All right, hon.

49:47.919 --> 49:48.818
I love you.

49:49.954 --> 49:51.921
- I love you more.

49:51.923 --> 49:53.622
- That's a whole lotta love.

49:58.496 --> 50:00.062
It warms my heart.

50:02.200 --> 50:03.132
Detective McDuff.

50:04.836 --> 50:05.901
- John Macbeth.

50:07.405 --> 50:08.304
- I know.

50:10.808 --> 50:11.774
Photos in Duncan's office.

50:11.776 --> 50:13.009
I put two and two together.

50:13.011 --> 50:16.012
- Well, you are the
detective, aren't you?

50:16.014 --> 50:16.912
- That's right.

50:19.484 --> 50:21.350
Mind if I grab a
few words with you?

50:22.153 --> 50:23.152
- My office?

50:24.956 --> 50:25.855
- Ladies first.

50:30.428 --> 50:31.794
Nice headband, by the way.

50:56.220 --> 50:59.922
- Is that the
phone company again?

50:59.924 --> 51:01.057
- Uh--

51:01.059 --> 51:01.957
- Was it?

51:10.735 --> 51:13.335
- is not
gonna make it foul play.

51:13.337 --> 51:16.072
- I know money's not
gonna make itself, right?

51:16.074 --> 51:17.540
- Not last time I checked.

51:17.542 --> 51:19.608
- Oh, and John,
when that Margaret gets in,

51:19.610 --> 51:22.044
can you do me a favor and
have her give me a call?

51:22.046 --> 51:23.546
- Absolutely.

51:23.548 --> 51:27.716
- A Margaret
called the LAPD last night

51:27.718 --> 51:31.153
about a scuffle she
overheard in the office.

51:35.793 --> 51:37.393
- Yes?

51:37.395 --> 51:38.427
- Hey, honey, it's me.

51:38.429 --> 51:39.328
- Oh.

51:41.999 --> 51:43.466
How did everything go?

51:46.437 --> 51:47.436
No wrinkles then?

51:50.875 --> 51:53.476
- Ah, there might be
one itty bitty wrinkle,

51:54.412 --> 51:55.945
but I'm taking care of it.

51:58.649 --> 52:00.082
- That's my man.

52:02.153 --> 52:03.986
- You don't wanna
know what it is?

52:05.356 --> 52:08.457
- I trust you to tell me
everything I need to know.

52:11.662 --> 52:12.928
- Okay.

52:12.930 --> 52:15.464
Well, I might be a bit late.

52:16.834 --> 52:17.666
- Okay.

52:17.668 --> 52:18.567
Bye, hon.

52:26.010 --> 52:27.076
- All right.

53:52.730 --> 53:53.963
- Hi, Stephen.

53:58.836 --> 53:59.868
- Who is it?

54:04.375 --> 54:07.910
Really, Stephen, bringing
that bitch into my house,

54:07.912 --> 54:08.811
my house!

54:10.081 --> 54:11.680
Stephen told me everything.

54:11.682 --> 54:12.615
Get out!

54:12.617 --> 54:13.582
Get out!

54:16.954 --> 54:17.786
- Mary!

54:17.788 --> 54:18.687
No.

54:26.297 --> 54:27.196
- Oh.

54:39.610 --> 54:42.611
Is, is she--

54:42.613 --> 54:43.512
- You did this.

54:45.449 --> 54:46.548
- I was--

54:48.519 --> 54:49.852
- You did this!

54:51.922 --> 54:52.788
You did this.

54:52.790 --> 54:53.856
- No.

54:56.460 --> 54:57.359
- Jane!

54:58.629 --> 55:00.095
- Oh, God.

55:09.340 --> 55:10.839
- Jane!

55:15.746 --> 55:16.645
Jane!

55:19.850 --> 55:20.749
Jane.

55:35.633 --> 55:37.333
- Are you headed out, Jo...

55:37.335 --> 55:38.400
Mr. Macbeth?

55:38.402 --> 55:39.802
- Yup, what do you need?

55:39.804 --> 55:41.236
- Well, it's just--

55:41.238 --> 55:42.237
- Spit it out!

55:43.641 --> 55:45.341
- Who's steering the ship?

55:45.343 --> 55:49.011
No one's seen Duncan,
and there are rumors.

55:50.081 --> 55:51.213
- Well, I don't know
who's steering the ship,

55:51.215 --> 55:52.581
but it's not me, all right?

55:52.583 --> 55:53.482
- Not yet.

55:58.956 --> 56:00.255
- Jane!

56:02.626 --> 56:07.696
Open the goddamn door, Jane!

56:31.088 --> 56:32.888
- John, John, John!

56:35.025 --> 56:36.325
- All right, look.

56:36.327 --> 56:39.795
We've all heard the
rumors about Duncan,

56:41.065 --> 56:44.166
Gregory Duncan and
Margaret Banquo.

56:45.536 --> 56:48.604
But until they are confirmed,
that's all they are, rumors.

56:49.807 --> 56:51.573
And as to who's
steering the ship,

56:52.943 --> 56:56.478
it doesn't matter
because we are the ship.

57:00.584 --> 57:02.050
- Jane!

57:03.154 --> 57:03.986
Jane!

57:03.988 --> 57:05.587
- Go away!

57:05.589 --> 57:06.422
- Jane!

57:06.424 --> 57:07.623
- Go away!

57:07.625 --> 57:10.259
- Open the
door, you fucking cunt!

57:10.261 --> 57:11.260
Jane!

57:11.262 --> 57:12.795
- Go away!

57:12.797 --> 57:15.764
- And the captains of our
own futures and successes.

57:17.435 --> 57:19.268
But I need you to
stay the course,

57:20.971 --> 57:23.939
for the Black Mist Corporation,
yeah, for our shareholders,

57:23.941 --> 57:25.974
but mostly for ourselves.

57:28.412 --> 57:32.047
But I need business
to continue as usual.

57:33.818 --> 57:35.017
Can you do that for me?

57:35.986 --> 57:36.885
- Yeah.

57:39.323 --> 57:40.255
- Can you?

57:40.257 --> 57:41.156
- Yes.

57:44.328 --> 57:45.227
- As you were.

57:48.833 --> 57:50.833
- All hail, Macbeth.

57:50.835 --> 57:52.734
- All hail, Macbeth.

58:38.282 --> 58:43.352
- Jane?

59:03.374 --> 59:05.807
Jane?

59:05.809 --> 59:06.708
Jane?

59:31.068 --> 59:31.900
- Oh, God!

59:31.902 --> 59:32.901
Oh, God!

59:32.903 --> 59:33.735
Oh, God, John.
- Jesus, Jane.

59:33.737 --> 59:34.570
- Oh, God!

59:34.572 --> 59:35.404
Oh, God!

59:35.406 --> 59:36.238
- What happened?

59:36.240 --> 59:37.072
What happened?

59:37.074 --> 59:38.006
- He was just here.

59:38.008 --> 59:39.241
- Jane, Jane, Jane.

59:39.243 --> 59:40.409
- He was just here.
- Jane, what happened?

59:40.411 --> 59:42.177
- He was just here.

59:42.179 --> 59:43.378
- Who, who?

59:43.380 --> 59:44.846
- Stephen, Stephen.
- What?

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:06.501
- My wife, my son are
dead because of you.

01:00:07.972 --> 01:00:08.870
Dead!

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:37.599
I'm gonna cut.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.080
- Got him!

01:01:28.919 --> 01:01:30.752
He's done!

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:31.920
I got him!

01:01:31.922 --> 01:01:32.888
I got him!

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:33.789
He's done!

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:41.403
- Someone, hon.

01:05:41.405 --> 01:05:43.338
Someone has been a busy bee.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.140
- Well, I should help.

01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:46.641
Honey, honey, honey.

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:47.575
- Hmm.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.344
- It's not designed for that.

01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:51.413
- This way, in case
anyone finds the body,

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:55.583
there wouldn't be
able fingerprints.

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:57.319
Next time, we'll do it better.

01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:58.219
- Next time?

01:05:58.221 --> 01:05:59.120
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:01.423
- Honey.

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:02.557
- Hmm.

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:03.458
- Slow down.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.392
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:05.927
- You are working far too hard.

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:09.698
Why don't you go clean up and
I will take care of all this?

01:06:11.702 --> 01:06:12.901
- I love you.

01:06:12.903 --> 01:06:14.035
- I love you.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.339
- Okay.

01:08:42.853 --> 01:08:43.751
- Help me.

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:46.121
Help me.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:49.524
- How?

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:53.361
- Can you
call an ambulance?

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:54.796
- We can't do that.

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:56.564
- What?

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:00.234
- Mary, I killed your husband.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:07.542
It was self defense, but I'm
not about to trust my life

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:09.877
in the hands of the
American judicial system.

01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:11.912
Am I right?

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:21.555
- So you're just gonna let
me die, me and my baby?

01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:24.792
- We didn't say that.

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:27.261
We just said that we're
not gonna call for help.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:39.073
- So what are you suggesting?

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:41.843
- Well, Jane tells
me you're a nurse.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.778
Is there a way we
could induce labor?

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:45.546
- No!

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:46.981
No, are you out of your mind?

01:09:48.118 --> 01:09:51.752
- Mary, your options are
pretty limited, dear.

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:10.505
- The ultrasound showed
him with his feet down,

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:13.608
ruling out any
traditional childbirth.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:16.344
The C-section is scheduled
for next Thursday.

01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:17.378
- C-section?

01:10:18.782 --> 01:10:23.017
Do you think you could talk
us through the procedure?

01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:24.419
- And then what?

01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:30.658
- And then hopefully, we'll
be able to save your baby.

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:35.930
- You're sick.

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:36.998
You're sick!

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:41.369
- Mary, I'm being practical.

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:42.237
- Help!

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:47.108
- If you'd
like, we could leave,

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.676
come back and figure
out something to do

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:51.079
with your corpse in the morning.

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:53.214
- She does seem like she
wants to be left alone.

01:10:53.216 --> 01:10:54.749
- But baby.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:55.750
- Honey, it's her house.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.051
- Mary--

01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:58.653
- Maybe she's embarrassed.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:10.832
- Get some
rubbing alcohol,

01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:13.368
some gauze and cotton pads.

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:15.436
- On it.

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:22.810
- It all worked out
perfectly, didn't it?

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:31.352
Oh, and something
sharp for the incision.

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:32.587
- I know what it's for!

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:40.928
- So now what?

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:47.769
- Clean the incision
area with the alcohol.

01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:49.370
- I'll do that.

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:50.305
- And the blade.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:56.678
And your hands!

01:11:58.148 --> 01:11:59.013
- Right.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.325
- And now?

01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:14.662
- You should
administer pain meds.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:17.332
- We can't do that.

01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:20.134
You're supposed to be walking
us through the procedure.

01:12:26.609 --> 01:12:28.409
- Are you sure you can do this?

01:12:40.724 --> 01:12:44.992
- Make a vertical incision
from below the navel

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:49.964
to the pelvic bone about
four inches in length.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.199
- Okay.

01:12:52.302 --> 01:12:54.902
- If you're gonna do
it, just fucking do it!

01:12:54.904 --> 01:12:57.872
- She is under a
lot of stress, hon.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:58.940
Here.

01:12:58.942 --> 01:12:59.974
- I'm sorry.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:09.083
- And pull out my baby.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:18.960
Shallower, shallower
incision now.

01:13:21.664 --> 01:13:25.566
Now get into the uterus
horizontally and pull out my baby.

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:35.676
- Shh, shh, shh!

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:42.116
I am trying to concentrate here.

01:13:43.219 --> 01:13:44.519
- Would you like me
to hold her down?

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.302
- John, John, John, the blanket.

01:14:01.304 --> 01:14:02.370
John.

01:14:04.207 --> 01:14:08.676
John, John, the blanket,
the blanket, the blanket.

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:09.610
- Jane!

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:10.344
- I got it, I got it.

01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:11.279
- You got it?

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:12.847
- I got it, I got it.

01:14:12.849 --> 01:14:13.748
I got it.

01:14:16.753 --> 01:14:21.022
- You have to clear,
clear any obstruction.

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:24.692
- Okay, okay.

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:25.626
John, where's the knife?

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:26.394
- Honey, I'm holding him.

01:14:26.396 --> 01:14:27.328
- John!

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:28.062
- I can't get the knife.

01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:29.464
I'm holding him!

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:43.411
- It's our baby.

01:14:43.413 --> 01:14:46.547
- Can I see him?

01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:47.448
My baby.

01:14:48.451 --> 01:14:51.118
He's my baby.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.253
Can I see him?

01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:53.721
- Shh.

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:54.555
- Just once.

01:14:54.557 --> 01:14:55.690
- Shh.

01:15:04.868 --> 01:15:06.334
- You're a daddy.

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.441
He's beautiful.

01:15:13.443 --> 01:15:14.342
- My baby.

01:15:15.278 --> 01:15:16.844
Can I see my baby?

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:19.914
My baby.

01:15:22.485 --> 01:15:23.384
My baby.

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:26.687
- Mary, Mary.

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:29.991
Mary.

01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:32.493
- I wanna see my son.
- It's our baby now.

01:15:32.495 --> 01:15:34.395
- I wanna see my baby.

01:15:35.498 --> 01:15:36.797
- He's our son.

01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:40.935
He's our beautiful little boy.

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:43.170
He's ours.

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:44.639
- You're keeping my baby?

01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:45.473
- He's ours.

01:15:45.475 --> 01:15:46.374
- My son!

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.080
I wanna see my baby!

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:54.515
No!

01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:55.516
No!

01:15:55.518 --> 01:15:57.885
You should have left him in me!

01:15:57.887 --> 01:15:58.819
No!

01:15:58.821 --> 01:16:00.121
No!

01:16:00.123 --> 01:16:00.955
No!

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.643
- Good morning, Mr. Macbeth.

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:23.978
- Lady Macbeth.

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:47.168
You know, you're right.

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:51.606
We can't always
get what we want.

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:55.009
I guess we get what we need.

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:02.483
I love you.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:06.253

This is Malory Broddick

The CEO leaves.

There's evidence of fraud,
employees running to the media.

Every dog should

01:18:38.848 --> 01:18:42.883
We've been trying to piece
together what the hell happened.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:46.153
And in talking with everyone,
the only consistent thing

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:49.323
we've heard is that you
seem to be the only one

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:51.525

hell they're doing.

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:55.596
Don't thank me just yet.

01:18:56.933 --> 01:18:59.934
We need you to take on
Duncan's responsibilities,

01:18:59.936 --> 01:19:04.939
clean up this mess and help
the company look healthy again.

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:06.640
- Do you think you can do that?

01:19:09.045 --> 01:19:10.611
- I believe I can.

01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:14.849

an additional 25%,

01:19:14.851 --> 01:19:17.451

we'll go from there.

01:19:19.155 --> 01:19:20.054

01:20:24.754 --> 01:20:26.654
He never gave me one.

01:20:26.656 --> 01:20:29.056
He kinda just took
care of my bills.

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:31.091
- Huh.

01:20:34.864 --> 01:20:36.463
- He told me if I worked out,

01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:40.935
that he would see about
a more permanent position

01:20:40.937 --> 01:20:45.039
at the company for
me in six months.

01:20:49.412 --> 01:20:52.446
- Your uncle isn't
here anymore, Malcolm.

01:20:53.249 --> 01:20:54.114
- I know,

01:20:55.218 --> 01:20:57.451
but it's been six months.

01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:00.888
I've worked really hard.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.156
- Yeah, no, no.

01:21:02.158 --> 01:21:05.559
You have, and I think
you should keep it up.

01:21:05.561 --> 01:21:07.728
Yeah, you know,
keep working hard,

01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:10.764
and in about six months,
we'll see what we can do

01:21:10.766 --> 01:21:12.733
and I'll get you a more
permanent position.

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:20.074
- But I have bills,
my student loans.

01:21:22.011 --> 01:21:27.081
- That'll be taken care
of with your hard work.

01:21:29.518 --> 01:21:31.151
I hope you believe in yourself.

01:21:31.954 --> 01:21:33.988
I believe in you, okay?

01:21:41.764 --> 01:21:43.264
What?

01:21:43.266 --> 01:21:44.164
Spit it out, man.

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:52.072
- But you just bought the
whole office champagne.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.610
- Champagne is cheap, man.

01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:41.155
- Hi, honey.

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:43.123
- Hi.

01:22:45.328 --> 01:22:46.660
- How was work?

01:22:49.565 --> 01:22:50.631
- Conducive.

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:57.271
- Anything I should know about?

01:23:13.956 --> 01:23:15.422
What are you gonna do, John?

01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:19.293
What are you gonna do?

01:23:19.295 --> 01:23:20.828
She knows everything.

01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:23.530
She was there that
night with Duncan.

01:23:23.532 --> 01:23:25.165
She called the cops!

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:27.301
She can destroy
everything, John!

01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:28.502
What are you going--

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:30.204
- Did I ask for your
fucking opinion?

01:23:33.909 --> 01:23:35.275
- No, you did not.

01:23:41.751 --> 01:23:43.584
- There are two paths, Jane.

01:23:45.254 --> 01:23:46.186
One is easy.

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:50.024
That's its only reward.

01:23:53.062 --> 01:23:54.395
I'll be home late.

01:23:56.065 --> 01:23:57.097
Don't wait up.

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:05.372
- Thank you, John, for
everything that you're doing

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:08.342
for your family,
for protecting us.

01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:10.144
Thank you.

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:21.281
- Hi, can I help you?

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:22.983
- Is Margaret here?

01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:25.719
Hi.

01:25:29.024 --> 01:25:29.990
- John.

01:25:38.234 --> 01:25:43.303
- It's all right.

01:26:06.128 --> 01:26:07.027
- John.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:12.499
Did you...

01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:21.141
How did it go?

01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:36.089
- Margaret's sister
was there with her kid.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:40.260
- What?

01:26:42.031 --> 01:26:45.499
John, John, what are we,

01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:48.135
what are we gonna do
if they were, if they--

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:51.338
What did you--

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.239
- I did them too.

01:27:13.329 --> 01:27:15.229
- Her kid, her kid?

01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:16.129
- Yeah.

01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:19.600
We're free now.

01:27:23.372 --> 01:27:25.739
No more looking in
the rear view mirror,

01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:30.711
put all this shit behind us.

01:28:16.659 --> 01:28:18.492
- Do you want coffee?

01:28:21.196 --> 01:28:22.929
- I like you, honey.

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:30.037
- Eggs?

01:28:30.039 --> 01:28:31.004
- I'm fine.

01:28:31.774 --> 01:28:32.673
- Juice?

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:35.909
I'm fine.

01:29:01.804 --> 01:29:02.636
Honey?

01:29:02.638 --> 01:29:03.537
- Hmm.

01:29:05.774 --> 01:29:06.673
- Honey.

01:29:11.613 --> 01:29:14.915
I gave you.

01:29:14.917 --> 01:29:16.416
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:16.418 --> 01:29:18.885
- Do you trust me to
protect this family?

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:23.957
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:25.294 --> 01:29:29.162
- Because I promise
you that I will.

01:29:31.066 --> 01:29:32.733
If I have to slaughter

01:29:33.802 --> 01:29:37.270
every man, woman and
child to do it, I will.

01:29:38.107 --> 01:29:38.839
I promise you that.

01:29:42.311 --> 01:29:44.211
You believe me, right?

01:29:47.015 --> 01:29:47.914
Good.

01:29:59.695 --> 01:30:01.495
I'll see you tonight.

01:30:20.516 --> 01:30:25.585
I love you.

01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:43.036
- Don't stand on
the outline, Deacon.

01:30:43.038 --> 01:30:45.572
Have you not heard of
contaminating a crime scene?

01:30:46.809 --> 01:30:48.074
McDuff.

01:30:48.076 --> 01:30:49.609
- Davies.

01:30:49.611 --> 01:30:52.813
- Welcome to the Black
Mist bloodbath bonanza.

01:30:52.815 --> 01:30:54.281
Everybody's half off.

01:30:54.283 --> 01:30:56.550
- Shut up.

01:30:56.552 --> 01:31:00.887
- You recognize this one,
Banquo, Margaret Banquo?

01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:02.823
- Yeah, yeah, I know her.

01:31:02.825 --> 01:31:04.024
- Yeah, of course you do.

01:31:04.026 --> 01:31:06.026
You've been looking
for her, right?

01:31:06.028 --> 01:31:07.527
Well, you're gonna
need dental records

01:31:07.529 --> 01:31:11.231
to identify the jigsaw puzzle
and mangled flesh over there

01:31:11.233 --> 01:31:14.301
and over there and under
the fucking end table,

01:31:14.303 --> 01:31:16.036
but I'll spare you the trouble.

01:31:16.038 --> 01:31:20.307
That is her sister, Joanna,
and the child sized corpse

01:31:20.309 --> 01:31:22.375
in the kitchen, that's
her sister's kid.

01:31:24.947 --> 01:31:26.746
It really makes you wish you
could do something about it,

01:31:26.748 --> 01:31:29.149
like finding the
guy who did this.

01:31:29.151 --> 01:31:31.384
If only we were the good guys.

01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:32.752
- Shut your mouth, Davies.

01:31:34.223 --> 01:31:35.489
- tell you

01:31:35.491 --> 01:31:37.357
we dragged the MacArthur
Park Lake this morning?

01:31:39.862 --> 01:31:41.461
Guess what's lying on a slab

01:31:41.463 --> 01:31:43.230
in the coroner's
office right now.

01:31:44.633 --> 01:31:48.001
Yeah, it's the former CEO of
the Black Mist Corporation,

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:49.469
a Gregory Duncan.

01:31:50.639 --> 01:31:51.705
You've been looking
for him too, right?

01:31:51.707 --> 01:31:53.373
- Shut the fuck up!

01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:26.406
- He did it.

01:32:47.062 --> 01:32:49.696
He did it all for you, for me.

01:32:55.437 --> 01:32:58.738
Oh, God, we are fortune's fools.

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:00.740

Oh, God, forgive me.

01:33:54.262 --> 01:33:55.195
- You shouldn't be here.

01:33:55.197 --> 01:33:56.496
- Well, neither should he.

01:34:00.068 --> 01:34:02.235
- Hey, you got a
gun for this guy?

01:34:04.906 --> 01:34:06.640
Yeah, a fucking gun.

01:34:06.642 --> 01:34:07.540
- Here.

01:34:13.515 --> 01:34:14.481
- Stay here.

01:34:16.118 --> 01:34:17.183
Don't do anything.

01:34:17.185 --> 01:34:18.918
Just stay fucking here.

01:34:22.824 --> 01:34:26.226
- Yeah, careful where
you point it, kid.

01:34:36.738 --> 01:34:38.371
- You're so little.

01:35:17.646 --> 01:35:19.212

Oh, God!
