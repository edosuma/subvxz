13:59.083 --> 14:00.792
of Kant, dude.

14:00.792 --> 14:03.959
Bodhi's a bank robber,
but also a cool surfer guy,

14:03.959 --> 14:05.583
which short-circuits
Johnny Utah's

14:05.583 --> 14:07.333
whole FBI-agent deal.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.834
Morality's slave
to passion.

14:08.834 --> 14:10.709
- Classic fucking Hume.
- Yeah.

14:10.709 --> 14:12.875
How did you
not see that?

14:24.792 --> 14:27.709
- [man] Who is it?
- My name's Ray Donovan.

14:27.709 --> 14:31.625
I'm looking
for Briana Gathright.

14:31.625 --> 14:35.625
I should notify you at this
time, you're being recorded.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.417
Last night a guy named
Varick Strauss--

14:37.417 --> 14:39.166
[Briana]
I don't have it anymore!

14:39.166 --> 14:41.667
Okay, clearly this is
illegal forced entry.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.250
- Briana.
- You don't have to tell him

14:43.250 --> 14:45.083
anything, Briana.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.458
Briana, could you just come out
here so we can talk, please?

14:47.458 --> 14:50.709
Say the word, Briana, and I'll
mace this son of a bitch.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.875
What's your name?

14:53.875 --> 14:55.709
Ted.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.834
Briana, I'd like to not hurt
your friend Ted here,

14:59.834 --> 15:02.250
so could you open
the fucking door?

15:02.250 --> 15:03.083
[door opens]

15:05.333 --> 15:08.333
I gave it to my advisor
last night--Sheldon Blackwood.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.875
You want it, go deal with him
at the law building.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.583
My phone.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.208

15:31.583 --> 15:33.583
And Jordan Pressman have
been increasing earnings

15:33.583 --> 15:36.542
through the '50s and '60s,
and continuing on--

15:36.542 --> 15:39.208
Mr. Donovan.

15:39.208 --> 15:41.208
Briana just rang.
She told me to expect you.

15:41.208 --> 15:45.208
- I'm Sheldon Blackwood.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.667
Well, your associate came
to my research assistant

15:47.667 --> 15:49.041
waving a demand letter

15:49.041 --> 15:50.834
filled with empty claims
and hearsay.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.583
Your research assistant
gave you something

15:52.583 --> 15:54.792
- that wasn't hers to give.
- A phone.

15:54.792 --> 15:57.333
A cheap, black phone
with no personal data,

15:57.333 --> 15:59.083
no receipt of purchase.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.625
Possession is nine-tenths
of the law, Mr. Donovan.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.542
I might reasonably claim
that that phone is mine.

16:03.542 --> 16:05.083
And I might reasonably
not give a shit

16:05.083 --> 16:07.417
about that law,
Professor.

16:07.417 --> 16:08.917
See you later.

16:08.917 --> 16:11.500
I hope not.
[chuckles]

16:11.500 --> 16:13.250
However it works
in your corner of the world,

16:13.250 --> 16:16.917
harassment means jail time
in mine.

16:31.583 --> 16:33.709
This "meet me now" shit--

16:33.709 --> 16:35.583
it's not gonna fly.

16:35.583 --> 16:37.667
I got a job for ya.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.125
What is it?

16:42.125 --> 16:45.125
Some guy's got a burner phone
that belongs to Governor Verona.

16:45.125 --> 16:47.625
- So?
- We got to get it.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.959
Why can't you do it?

16:49.959 --> 16:52.291
I got a meeting
at Bridget's school.

16:52.291 --> 16:55.625
- Is everything all right?
- Abby took off for Boston.

16:55.625 --> 16:57.542
Kids are out of sorts.

17:01.583 --> 17:03.792
All right, today only.

17:03.792 --> 17:07.000
Twice my usual rate.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.458
I'll give you three.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.250
That's not how
a negotiation works.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.041
I know what you're worth.

17:15.875 --> 17:17.667

Wow, these guys
are going in.

17:27.667 --> 17:30.166
Yeah, they been keeping it
pent up too long.

[cell phone rings]

17:36.000 --> 17:37.750
Is your apartment
The El Dorado?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.166
- Yeah, why?
- I'm here.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.208
I just got dropped off.
How do I get in?

17:41.208 --> 17:43.834
Don't move.
I'm coming there.

17:43.834 --> 17:46.166
- You got this under control?
- Yeah, shit's running itself.

Ah, what a blessing
you are.

17:50.458 --> 17:52.000
- What up?
- These guys have snorted

17:52.000 --> 17:54.166
every grain of coke.
We got to wind it down.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.709
No, we don't.
We good.

17:55.709 --> 17:56.542

- I mean, Michelle, come on.

17:56.542 --> 17:57.959
Look at these dudes.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.500
They don't want to wind it down.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.917
Okay? Tomorrow they're gonna
be nerds in a cubicle.

18:01.917 --> 18:03.834

It's Daryll Donovan.

Hey, listen, I need

18:22.792 --> 18:25.291
Bunchy, a little help here.
I'm lost.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.166
- [panting]
- All right, look,

18:27.166 --> 18:29.208
you got to get
your form down first.

18:29.208 --> 18:33.667
Good stance, go single.
One hand at a time.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.250
- All right?
- Yeah.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.208
Stare at that yellow tape.

18:39.375 --> 18:41.000
Nice.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.083
Hey, Stan told me
you got a settlement.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.792
Yeah?

18:45.792 --> 18:48.834
- See? Working my rhythm.
- You beat the Church.

18:48.834 --> 18:50.792
David and Goliath,
am I right?

18:50.792 --> 18:53.250
Class action.
There was six of us.

18:53.250 --> 18:56.291
Yeah, lawyers wouldn't
let me sue, so...

18:56.291 --> 18:59.375
- Why not?
- [Teresa] Yo!

18:59.375 --> 19:01.000
The foam's worn down
in your shitty-ass gloves,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.417
I'm gonna cut
my fucking knuckles.

19:04.417 --> 19:06.917
Okay.

19:06.917 --> 19:08.875
Let's see what
we can do about that.

19:08.875 --> 19:10.959
Look, um,
just keep practicing.

19:10.959 --> 19:12.959
- Yep.
- And breathe out your nose.

19:12.959 --> 19:16.250
Thanks.

19:16.250 --> 19:18.709
What was he talking about?

19:18.709 --> 19:21.166
Why'd the Church
give you money?

19:32.959 --> 19:35.125
You can tell me whatever.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.500
I really like you.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.792
And it's not worth
me being around you

19:43.792 --> 19:46.208
- if you're just gonna--
- Jesus, spit it out already.

19:59.083 --> 20:02.208
A priest messed around
with me when I was a kid.

20:04.834 --> 20:07.125
Probably you need
to know that.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.834
No wonder
you're so fucked up.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.750
If you don't want to
be around me no more,

20:17.750 --> 20:19.667
I get it.

20:23.125 --> 20:25.250
I ain't got no problem
with it.

20:31.208 --> 20:32.834
Mom went back to Boston.

20:32.834 --> 20:34.917
Boston?
What for?

20:34.917 --> 20:35.959
I don't know.
All Dad ever says

20:35.959 --> 20:37.542
is "don't worry
about it."

20:37.542 --> 20:38.959
Maybe she went back
to see that

cocksucker father
of hers

20:40.333 --> 20:41.875
or enjoy
the fall foliage.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.917
I think she left
'cause I freaked her out.

20:43.917 --> 20:45.834
She walked in on me
at a bad time.

20:45.834 --> 20:48.333
Bad time?

20:48.333 --> 20:50.208
Were you jerking off?

20:52.166 --> 20:55.208
Conor, if God didn't want us
to jerk off,

20:55.208 --> 20:56.834
he would've given us
shorter arms.

20:56.834 --> 20:59.041
It's natural.

20:59.041 --> 21:01.792
- [cell phone ringing]
- Thanks, Grandpa.

21:01.792 --> 21:05.875
But for Christ's sake,
lock the fucking door.

Another fucking ten.
Did they ask for it?

Ah, shit.
I'll be right there.

We're going for a ride.

Mm, very high percentile
on her English IC exam.

she was still in diapers.

just picked it up herself.

21:29.208 --> 21:31.542
I see the Calabasas transcripts
are good.

21:31.542 --> 21:33.709
Always worked hard.
Never had to push her.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.417
Yes, well,
you might want to start.

21:35.417 --> 21:37.166
There are some
trouble zones this semester.

21:37.166 --> 21:40.417
B-minus in French,
D in Calculus,

21:40.417 --> 21:41.417
- Chemistry is a C--
- D?

21:41.417 --> 21:42.959
Those are just
mid-term grades.

21:42.959 --> 21:45.000
Yes, but, Bridget, we distribute
these mid-term marks

21:45.000 --> 21:46.959
to ring an alarm
before the student destroys

21:46.959 --> 21:49.250
her chances at the Harvards
and Yales.

21:49.250 --> 21:50.583
Those schools
have to know

21:50.583 --> 21:52.458
that Rossmore
is way more strict.

21:56.417 --> 22:00.417
Bridget's personal statement--
have you read it?

22:00.417 --> 22:03.333
- Not yet, no.
- She was prompted to share

22:03.333 --> 22:06.041
a piece of background that's
central to her identity.

22:06.041 --> 22:07.750
[sighs]
She wrote about singing.

22:07.750 --> 22:11.041
- What's wrong with singing?
- Well, as a hobby, nothing.

22:11.041 --> 22:12.875
As a sales point
for a student

22:12.875 --> 22:14.750
with a shaky academic record--
weak.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.250
You got any suggestions,
or you just gonna keep

22:16.250 --> 22:17.959
- lobbing insults at her?
- Dad.

22:17.959 --> 22:20.875
Bridget, try to find something
revealing to write about,

22:20.875 --> 22:22.417
something raw.

22:22.417 --> 22:24.125
A story of hardship would help
contextualize

22:24.125 --> 22:26.750
a flagging academic record.

22:26.750 --> 22:30.083
- [Bridget] Sorry about that.
- Sorry about what?

22:30.083 --> 22:31.834
I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.542
- You didn't.
- I know college stuff

22:33.542 --> 22:35.250
isn't really
your métier.

22:35.250 --> 22:37.583
My what?

22:37.583 --> 22:41.125

to put him on the phone

be very low.

go with you?

some time for myself.

- For yourself?

23:43.542 --> 23:47.625
Mom, I don't--I don't have
a single friend at this school,

23:47.625 --> 23:49.834
and I'm not Conor's mother.

23:49.834 --> 23:52.458
I can barely handle
my own shit.

23:52.458 --> 23:54.083
Okay, sweetheart,

23:54.083 --> 23:56.917
Look, I'll be on
the next flight home, okay?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.083
I love you.

24:04.917 --> 24:07.041
- She okay?
- I got to get back.

24:07.041 --> 24:09.375
She needs me.

24:09.375 --> 24:12.083
As soon as I talk to Ray,
we'll get a check cut,

24:12.083 --> 24:13.917
and we'll get
this bar thing going.

24:13.917 --> 24:16.709
- As soon as you talk to Ray.
- Yeah.

24:16.709 --> 24:18.625
Once he knows
how important it is,

24:18.625 --> 24:19.834
he'll be fine with it.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.500
Don't do this.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.083
Don't get our hopes up
and then just go blow us off.

what it is to stay married?

24:34.917 --> 24:36.375
How long did you last,
Margaret?

24:36.375 --> 24:37.333
You know they don't
give out prizes

24:37.333 --> 24:39.583
for putting up
with bullshit.

24:39.583 --> 24:41.041
At least I didn't
hang in there with a guy

24:41.041 --> 24:42.250
who fucks everything
with a pulse

24:42.250 --> 24:45.166
and then just shuts me up
with money.

Writ of  habeas  petition.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.041
Anyone? Anyone?
Nothing?

25:03.041 --> 25:05.417
Well, neither of the state
appellate's decisions

25:05.417 --> 25:07.291
really provided
any comprehensive summary

25:07.291 --> 25:10.667
of the facts with respect
to Smith's  habeas  petition.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.125
But let's talk
about surveillance.

25:12.125 --> 25:14.834
