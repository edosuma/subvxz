00:00.600 --> 00:03.001
<i>I've been brought in
from the Metropolitan Police</i>

00:03.160 --> 00:06.687
<i>to lead a review into the investigation
of the murder of Alice Monroe.</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:09.571
<i>He had things entirely under his control,</i>

00:09.720 --> 00:12.564
<i>which leads me to think
that this was not his first murder.</i>

00:12.720 --> 00:15.849
Go back to your review, Stella.
I don't want the two murders linked.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.722
Failure to see that the crimes are linked is
the thing that will allow the killer to strike again.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.731
- Do you think her hair's been clipped?
- Where?

00:25.880 --> 00:26.881
<i>There.</i>

00:27.040 --> 00:29.247
<i>This is the third murder in three months, Jim.</i>

00:29.400 --> 00:31.448
<i>If we don't stop him he will kill again.</i>

00:31.600 --> 00:33.762
Excuse me, is this your purse?

00:33.920 --> 00:36.048
Oh. Thank you so much.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.927
<i>Here's been a shooting.</i>

00:39.080 --> 00:41.924
<i>The detective we saw near
the Falls Road on Sunday night.</i>

00:42.080 --> 00:45.766
- James Olson was a married man, Stella.
- You were a married man...

00:45.920 --> 00:47.684
when you spent a night in my bed.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.320
<i>He clearly has a victim type.</i>

00:50.480 --> 00:53.484
They are not victims of chance,
they are victims of choice.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.087
<i>It's possible that he's out there
stalking his next victim now.</i>

01:01.280 --> 01:04.807
There's someone to see you, ma'am.
Rose Stagg, a friend of Professor Reed Smith?

01:04.959 --> 01:07.008
I spent years interviewing the victims of rape.

01:07.160 --> 01:12.041
<i>I don't think anyone ever felt worse
after talking to me about their experiences.</i>

01:14.920 --> 01:17.241
I have something terrible to confess.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.323
<i>I've been having an affair.</i>

01:19.480 --> 01:21.005
I called you to say it's over.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.800
It won't be over until I stop you.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.850
You had your chance...now it's too late.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.609
We have an E-FIT from Rose Stagg.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.406
Could he really look like that?

01:31.560 --> 01:34.484
Ma'am?
Annie Brawley has regained consciousness.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.160
Now let's try something different.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.890
If you were on the other side of your bedroom,

01:55.760 --> 01:57.762
standing by the window...

02:00.800 --> 02:02.802
What would you have seen?

02:08.240 --> 02:10.241
Me on the bed.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.442
Him behind me.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.842
I was on my side at first.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.488
Tied up.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.882
What else?

02:36.640 --> 02:38.768
Can you see him clearly?

02:38.920 --> 02:40.649
No.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.450
No.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.730
That's OK. Let's...take a step back.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.808
Earlier that night
you had dinner with your brother.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.762
Do you remember what Joe had to eat?

03:00.080 --> 03:02.082
Do you remember what you ordered?

03:10.400 --> 03:20.402
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

03:22.920 --> 03:24.922
What are you doing?

03:29.160 --> 03:32.926
Once upon a time...this worked for me.

03:38.920 --> 03:42.288
You snap the band...on your wrist

03:44.200 --> 03:46.965
...when your thoughts and feelings
overwhelm you.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:58.200 --> 05:00.009
Is that mine?

05:00.160 --> 05:01.525
Yes.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.921
It's been brushed for prints.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.129
They only found yours.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.966
You'll see...some of the pages are dusty.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.448
Some people find writing useful.

05:23.320 --> 05:27.370
Putting down...thoughts, whatever they may be.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.567
Reading the entries you made might help.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.202
I'm sorry.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.328
I want to remember. I really do.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.042
I know.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.209
<i>My diary
was in a drawer in my bedroom.</i>

06:21.240 --> 06:23.242
<i>Yes.</i>

06:24.600 --> 06:27.126
<i>He was waiting for me in my bedroom.</i>

06:34.120 --> 06:36.122
If he was wearing gloves...

06:37.600 --> 06:40.490
...he could have read it and not left any prints.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.162
Yes.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.928
Do you think that he read it?

06:48.480 --> 06:49.925
Yes.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.408
You know, it's hard for everyone.

06:56.560 --> 07:00.121
Because...l look the same...

07:02.400 --> 07:04.402
The same as I did before.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.202
But I'm not the same.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.049
Hello?

07:30.280 --> 07:32.282
Hello?

07:34.080 --> 07:36.731
Hang on. Hang on, I'll get a better signal.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.565
Hello?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.722
<i>- Daddy?</i>
- Livvy?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.241
- Daddy?
- Can you hear me?

07:44.400 --> 07:46.528
<i>Yes.</i>

07:48.400 --> 07:50.402
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.121
It's the middle of the night.
Why aren't you asleep?

07:53.280 --> 07:55.282
<i>- I can't sleep.</i>
- Why, darling?

07:56.200 --> 07:59.204
<i>- I'm really worried, Daddy.</i>
- What about?

07:59.520 --> 08:01.204
<i>My dollies.</i>

08:01.360 --> 08:04.682
<i>I left them behind. All of them.</i>

08:04.840 --> 08:08.845
<i>When, Mummy, me and Liam left Scotland.</i>

08:10.000 --> 08:13.049
- What did you leave behind?
- <i>All of my dollies.- Hello?</i>

08:14.560 --> 08:17.370
- Where did you leave them?
<i>- In the bath, I think.</i>

08:17.520 --> 08:19.522
<i>Haven't you seen them?</i>

08:20.040 --> 08:21.530
No.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.808
<i>Haven't you had a bath in all that time?</i>

08:25.200 --> 08:28.409
- It hasn't been that long.
<i>- Nearly a whole week.</i>

08:29.480 --> 08:31.482
We have a shower downstairs.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.441
<i>The thing is, I really need them.</i>

08:34.679 --> 08:36.761
<i>Can you bring them when you come home?</i>

08:38.200 --> 08:41.363
- I'm not sure when that's gonna be, darling.
. MW

08:42.000 --> 08:44.970
It was Mummy decided to go home, not me.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.165
<i>I need them, Daddy. I really do.</i>

08:50.440 --> 08:52.442
<i>Please, Daddy. Please.</i>

12:23.280 --> 12:25.726
Oh, Jesus!

12:27.400 --> 12:29.164
Oh!

12:29.320 --> 12:32.722
- Don't you announce yourself?
- I thought that I was expected.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.328
I wasn't sure you'd come.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.002
Nice shoes.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.769
ls that why I'm here - to amuse you?

13:06.600 --> 13:12.130
I'd always thought of him as stalking victims,
calculating the risks, planning it all out...

13:13.360 --> 13:17.285
...very controlled, calm, cold-blooded.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.962
The killing of Joe was different.
ll was impulsive, bloody.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.802
Hot-blooded.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.170
If we didn't know it then,
we certainly know it now, that he's...

13:29.000 --> 13:30.923
...driven by huge amounts of rage.

13:31.400 --> 13:36.201
So, we have an eye-witness
who can't quite bring herself to recall the face,

13:36.360 --> 13:38.727
masked or unmasked,
of the man who did all this.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.882
It's a question of unlocking her.

13:41.040 --> 13:44.283
She's traumatised. Grief-stricken.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.442
She just needs more time,
more professional help.

13:49.600 --> 13:53.366
It's been ten days, Stella.
We're running out of time.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.522
Hm. And money.

13:56.520 --> 14:00.969
I er...I had these drawn up
for the Policing Executive tomorrow.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.924
Emergency funding.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.127
To support the investigation.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.329
1.8 million.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.482
Well, perhaps you can...

14:18.520 --> 14:21.046
“take a look at the figures on the way home?

14:56.800 --> 14:59.610
We need to make
some kind of announcement soon.

14:59.760 --> 15:03.651
Indicate some kind of progress.
Allay fears. Some good news.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.089
I know.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.242
Where's your car?

15:09.720 --> 15:12.803
- I'll walk you.
- In those shoes?

15:15.920 --> 15:17.922
I'm fine.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.602
Is this your car?

15:43.280 --> 15:45.760
It is. And I'd like him to get off it.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.442
What are you doing here?

15:50.560 --> 15:52.767
I want all of you to move away from my car.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.290
What's the difference between
James Olson and a black cab?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.323
Black cab can take five in the back.

16:06.640 --> 16:07.721
What's your name?

16:07.880 --> 16:11.362
What's that got to do with you, Little Bo Beep,
who's lost her sheep?

16:15.480 --> 16:19.405
Don't come back here again. Do you hear me?

16:20.800 --> 16:22.802
You're not welcome.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.082
Mummy?

18:48.560 --> 18:50.562
Mummy?

18:51.120 --> 18:53.009
I've made you a cup of tea.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.448
Oh, you know you're not
supposed to boil the kettle.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.602
- I haven't.
- Oh.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.161
Mm. That's lovely.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.849
When Daddy's back I'll make him one too.
But with sugar.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.050
Superintendent Gibson?

19:47.400 --> 19:48.925
Detective Superintendent Gibson,

19:49.080 --> 19:51.845
would you like to comment on the piece
in today's Belfast Chronicle?

19:52.000 --> 19:55.607
Are reports the surviving victim
is helping the police with their inquiries true?

19:55.760 --> 19:58.161
- They are.
- Are you prepared to meet Mrs Olson,

19:58.320 --> 20:01.051
to discuss your alleged affair with her husband?

20:04.920 --> 20:06.968
- I almost didn't recognise you.
- Really!

20:07.120 --> 20:10.010
- Why are you wearing that?
- The same reason you're weaning that.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.640
- Yours is a Met uniform.
- I'm a Met officer.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.087
At least I was the last time I checked.

20:23.960 --> 20:28.568
I thought I should look as unfeminine
as possible given this morning's Chronicle.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.402
It hasn't worked.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.446
Just to warn you, Monroe's spoiling for a fight.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.410
There's a strong possibility
he'll push for a 28-day review

20:38.560 --> 20:40.210
into the progress of the bask force.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.727
- You're joking?
- What?

20:42.880 --> 20:44.962
What, you think you're above such procedures?

20:45.120 --> 20:47.043
Well, who would do it?

20:47.200 --> 20:49.202
Well, we'd find someone.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.602
- What do you want?
- Er...cappuccino.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.962
Two regular cappuccinos, please.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.449
Sally?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.002
Sally?

21:18.720 --> 21:22.042
- Sally, did you not hear me calling you?
- I'm late for work.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.767
- What's wrong?
- "What's wrong?"

21:25.600 --> 21:28.171
- I don't understand.
- Don't you?

21:28.320 --> 21:30.368
No.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.887
- I know everything.
- What are you talking about?

21:33.040 --> 21:35.964
Paul confessed, Katie.
There's no need to cover for him.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.927
- Confessed to what?
- Your affair.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.651
Your three-month underage affair.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.851
What?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.571
In my house, under my roof. In my bed!

21:46.720 --> 21:49.326
For all I know while my children were sleeping.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.969
This is bullshit. What did he say about us?

21:53.120 --> 21:54.884
"Us"? Jesus.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.929
Whatever he's told you, he's lying.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.845
- Why would he lie about something like that?
- I don't know.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.002
Just leave my family alone.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.608
There's been no affair.
What happened is he attacked me.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.645
What?

22:11.800 --> 22:14.246
That night you left us alone in the study.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.402
I'd come over to listen to music.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.524
He took the opportunity to attack me.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.411
- Pin me to the floor, climb on top of me.
- Enough!

22:22.200 --> 22:25.170
You have no idea who he is or what he's like.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.202
Ask him about the lock of hair.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.960
- What's going on?
- Bitch!

23:10.840 --> 23:12.968
You have one new massage.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.362
<i>I just bumped info your girlfriend.</i>

23:17.040 --> 23:18.565
<i>You need to get your story straight.</i>

23:18.720 --> 23:22.008
<i>According to her there's been no affair,
just some kind of sexual assault.</i>

23:22.160 --> 23:24.447
<i>Paul, what did you do to her?</i>

23:25.080 --> 23:29.085
<i>Did you rape her in your study,
while the kids were sleeping?</i>

23:30.800 --> 23:33.371
<i>She seems to think
she knows you better than I do.</i>

23:33.520 --> 23:37.161
<i>I don't know, maybe she does.
This is all so humiliating.</i>

23:38.640 --> 23:40.927
<i>I want you to just stay away, Paul, OK?</i>

23:41.080 --> 23:44.448
<i>From me, from the kids. Just... I want...</i>

24:38.400 --> 24:40.368
Good morning, ma'am.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.884
Yep?

25:20.280 --> 25:23.409
- Marion Kay's in the conference mom, ma'am.
- Thanks.

25:28.480 --> 25:31.802
I was thinking, ma'am,
that I should go back into uniform.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.246
- Really?
- If you can spare me?

25:44.760 --> 25:47.525
- I can't.
- Thank you, ma'am.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.762
Tell me why.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.449
I've often wondered why you took me off
the street in the first place.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.682
What do you think?

26:02.600 --> 26:04.728
Because I was erm...

26:05.520 --> 26:08.046
“struggling to deal with what had happened.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.646
Because I couldn't stop myself from shaking.

26:10.800 --> 26:15.249
I don't go around rescuing patrol cops
who are disturbed by what they've seen.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.402
I don't think so.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.602
It was totally selfish.

26:24.840 --> 26:28.447
I was new. I wanted someone by my side.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.602
Someone l...felt I could trust.

26:33.040 --> 26:36.044
I was impressed by your honesty at the scene.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.251
I think I've learnt a lot.
I think I can put it to good use on the street.

26:43.400 --> 26:46.609
Cheating death? Fighting for truth and justice?

26:47.800 --> 26:49.404
Something like that, yeah.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.321
- I'll think about 'n.
- Thank you, ma'am.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.286
<i>Sorry, I've nothing new to tell you.</i>

27:32.880 --> 27:34.723
<i>How is your father bearing up?</i>

27:35.960 --> 27:38.964
That's what everyone always asks me first.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.882
How's Daddy?

27:43.000 --> 27:45.002
It really pisses me off.

27:46.320 --> 27:49.881
All the cards, all the letters of condolence,
they're all addressed to Dad.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.208
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.802
How are you?

28:00.840 --> 28:03.207
It's the right first question.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.082
I know it is.

28:06.840 --> 28:09.730
Fathers aren't supposed
to bury their daughters.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.090
But...

28:16.720 --> 28:20.406
But I can't remember a time in my life
when Sarah wasn't there.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.766
<i>There's so many "if only's".</i>

28:32.920 --> 28:35.241
<i>If only she hadn't turned the police away.</i>

28:35.960 --> 28:39.487
<i>If only the locksmith
had changed the back door straight away.</i>

28:39.800 --> 28:44.044
If only I had just made her
come and stay with us.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.169
I just wish I could think about something else.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.800
For five minutes, even.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.447
But there is so much stuff all the time.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.046
In the papers, on the television.

29:00.280 --> 29:03.124
And it is always Alice's picture.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.202
It's never Sarah.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.527
Today's paper even got her age wrong.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.804
It's just to do with Alice's name, I think.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.931
The Monroe connection,
the fund that's been set up.

29:23.200 --> 29:26.682
I worry because there's a number of victims.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.166
Sarah's lost her identity a bit.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.802
Not for me.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.731
- Yep?
- Rose Stagg has cried off.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.245
Pressure of work.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.607
Oh... Right.

30:07.680 --> 30:13.164
<i>The train on platform two is
the Larne Harbour to Belfast Central service,</i>

30:13.320 --> 30:19.851
<i>calling at Larne Town, Glynn,
Magheramorne, Ballycally, Whitehead.“...</i>

30:20.080 --> 30:22.686
Rose, I really need to see you today.

30:22.840 --> 30:25.127
I'm sorry. I've so much work on.

30:25.720 --> 30:28.007
<i>The interview you gave was informal.</i>

30:28.320 --> 30:30.322
<i>I took notes, but...</i>

30:31.160 --> 30:35.245
I really need to gel every last bit
of information from you if I can.

30:36.360 --> 30:38.806
Recorded, videoed, transcribed.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.522
I know.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.722
As I told you...

30:45.000 --> 30:47.401
when I met Peter I already had a boyfriend.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.403
<i>Yes.</i>

30:49.560 --> 30:52.723
The boyfriend was Tom,
who became my husband.

30:52.880 --> 30:56.089
<i>I presumed that
And you never told him what happened?</i>

30:56.240 --> 31:01.371
No. I had bruises all over my neck.
Really bad headaches.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.931
My voice was hoarse.

31:03.800 --> 31:06.041
So I simply stopped seeing him.

31:07.080 --> 31:10.402
Rose, I understand
it will be a difficult conversation...

31:12.600 --> 31:14.728
But there are bigger issues.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.842
I know.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.322
- Hello?
- I'm here.

31:24.360 --> 31:27.807
<i>Talk to him tonight.
Come and see me tomorrow.</i>

31:30.480 --> 31:33.006
- I can come in at noon.
<i>- I'll see you then.</i>

31:47.920 --> 31:50.207
<i>He's written and he's phoned</i>

31:50.840 --> 31:55.926
He derives pleasure, it seems,
from involving himself in the investigation.

31:56.200 --> 32:01.081
And for that reason I'd like to maintain
the 24/7 monitoring oi my old private phone,

32:01.240 --> 32:04.608
in the hope that maybe
he will call that number again.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.050
Erm... What kind of response
to the composite likeness?

32:09.200 --> 32:11.407
The Rose Stagg E-FIT? Good.

32:11.560 --> 32:15.201
But the fact that 'It's from eight or nine years ago
has caused a degree of confusion.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.567
Could he now be fat? Could he now be bald?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.242
Well, he's definitely not fat.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.242
Do you think that looks like me?

33:03.400 --> 33:05.402
A wee bit, maybe.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.721
- May I?
- Go ahead.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.000
What about now?

33:44.720 --> 33:46.290
A bit more now.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.446
You think it's safe for me to go back to Belfast?

33:52.240 --> 33:54.971
I don't think you've got anything to worry about.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.644
Do you live in the city?

33:58.800 --> 34:01.565
I do. In South Belfast.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.085
Two sweets away from one of the girls that died.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.922
Do you live alone?

34:11.480 --> 34:13.482
Yeah.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.284
How about you?

34:16.440 --> 34:21.047
No. No, I'm travelling back
to my wife and two kids.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.161
Ah.

34:24.320 --> 34:29.485
The only possible excuse for a grown man
to be travelling with four dollies in his bag.

34:36.679 --> 34:38.444
You're blonde?

34:38.600 --> 34:41.080
All the other girls have been dark, haven't they?

34:42.400 --> 34:43.844
Actually, I'm not.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.928
- Not what?
- Blonde.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.761
What do you mean?

34:50.920 --> 34:54.322
I was dark, until all this started happening.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.482
You're kidding?

35:01.880 --> 35:04.406
There. Proof.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.402
I never would have guessed.

35:23.480 --> 35:28.361
<i>As we know, offenders lend gto
commit crimes in areas that they're familiar with.</i>

35:30.480 --> 35:34.485
<i>The first kill usually lakes place
closest lo that anchor point.</i>

35:34.640 --> 35:37.246
Near a residence or a place of work.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.802
If we look at the spatial relationships
between the crime scenes,

35:40.960 --> 35:46.205
it suggests the offender
lives in the University Quarter or Ravenhill.

35:46.360 --> 35:49.921
Travelling to and from the crime scenes on foot.

35:50.240 --> 35:54.962
And that would make the attack on Annie
in the Shankill an aberration of sorts.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.402
Presumably he somehow identified her
as a potential victim.

36:00.520 --> 36:04.206
Young, dark, attractive, educated.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.482
<i>And disregarded the fad
first she lived outside his natural territory.</i>

36:08.640 --> 36:11.689
<i>And then he got into difficulties as a result.</i>

36:12.960 --> 36:14.803
We know that he fled on fool.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.486
But he didn't run back
towards the University Quarter.

36:17.640 --> 36:20.246
He ran out east towards the City Airport.

36:20.800 --> 36:23.531
That's a distance of three miles. Why?

36:26.760 --> 36:29.161
<i>Perhaps he has
a place out there somewhere.</i>

36:30.320 --> 36:32.800
<i>A lockup or a storage unit or...</i>

36:33.480 --> 36:35.847
<i>somewhere he changes or keeps a vehicle.</i>

36:43.280 --> 36:47.171
A trawl of CCTV cameras along his route
from the Shankill out towards the airport

36:47.320 --> 36:49.049
has offered up these images.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.962
No clear view of his face.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.849
The possibility that he has a beard.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.487
I'm getting some video stills produced.

36:59.640 --> 37:05.602
He anticipated that we would use human scent
dogs and he...crossed a stretch of water.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.808
I believe he took the murder weapon with him.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.201
The search for that weapon is still ongoing.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.767
Truth is, we're pretty much running out of time
on the search for the weapon.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.924
We've searched miles of the roadway
on the route we think he took.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.765
Right up to the water's edge
where the scent dogs lost him.

37:21.920 --> 37:25.049
We've run a line across from that point
to where we think he emerged.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.248
We're searching both sides of that line.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.289
But the water visibility is nil.

37:29.440 --> 37:33.047
Weeds, refuse.
My divers can only work by touch.

37:34.040 --> 37:37.726
There's deep mud too.
Basically, we've run out of time and money.

37:56.280 --> 38:01.320
It's been ten days now
and there's been some speculation

38:01.480 --> 38:04.882
that the killer has stayed true to his word.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.727
That he's...gone away.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.048
That he's stopped.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.848
I don't believe that it works that way.

38:16.040 --> 38:19.886
Remember...that there is a cycle
that he goes through.

38:21.520 --> 38:24.205
After an attack there's a cooling off period.

38:26.320 --> 38:30.405
But then the deviant fantasies start to kick in.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.762
And the pressure starts to build.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.322
<i>Remember, it's an addiction.</i>

38:41.640 --> 38:45.929
<i>He takes his fantasies
and he turns them into reality.</i>

38:47.480 --> 38:50.962
<i>That makes him feel superior to the rest of us...</i>

38:51.840 --> 38:53.842
<i>...mere mortals...</i>

38:54.640 --> 38:56.642
<i>...as such.</i>

38:57.520 --> 38:59.602
<i>In his own mind...</i>

39:00.800 --> 39:05.806
<i>...he feels he has the right to decide
who lives and who dies.</i>

39:08.280 --> 39:11.124
In order to do the terrible things that he does...

39:12.000 --> 39:15.004
<i>...the killer dehumanises his victims.</i>

39:16.600 --> 39:18.648
Let's do the opposite.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.442
Let's keep them alive.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.368
For us, for their families,
friends, work colleagues.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.002
For the public.

39:28.640 --> 39:32.929
Let's keep them alive until...this man is caught.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.203
Jesus.

40:14.360 --> 40:16.362
God, you frightened me.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.965
- How did you get in?
- Your side door was unlocked.

40:22.320 --> 40:26.689
- What are you doing here?
- Why did you say those things to Sally Ann?

40:27.240 --> 40:29.049
What things?

40:29.520 --> 40:31.522
Things about me - you and me.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.321
- What things?
- You know what things.

40:35.440 --> 40:38.125
- I told you to stay away.
- I have.

40:38.600 --> 40:41.171
How was I supposed to know she'd be there?

40:43.280 --> 40:45.123
Why are you trying to make trouble for me?

40:45.280 --> 40:48.045
Sally Ann now thinks
that I attacked you that night in the study.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.521
- You did!
- She thinks I raped you.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.286
She thinks
we've been having an affair for months.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.442
Where did she get that idea?

40:57.600 --> 40:59.602
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. You told her.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.445
- Why would I do that?
- I've been asking myself the same thing.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.682
- And?
- Katie?

41:06.680 --> 41:08.045
Are you OK?

41:08.200 --> 41:10.202
Yeah. This is Paul.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.370
- Oh.
- I'll be up in a minute.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.922
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.682
Why are you staring at her?

41:25.960 --> 41:27.849
I'm not.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.923
She's not your type.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.401
- I don't have a type.
- Liar.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.562
I'm not lying.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.601
Dark-haired, beautiful.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.561
- Katie...
- Why would you lie to your wife?

41:42.720 --> 41:44.722
What are you covering up?

41:48.560 --> 41:50.562
You're playing a dangerous game.

41:51.400 --> 41:54.722
I came here to tell you to stay away
from my wife and my children.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.847
The police officer on the television said the killer
clipped a lock of hair from each of the victims.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.562
You had a lock of hair in your study.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.526
I explained that. It was my mothers hair.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.602
I saw the footage of you at the park.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.002
The Botanic Gardens.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.044
We go them all the time.
It's Olivia's favourite place.

42:19.200 --> 42:23.489
It's also where Sarah Kay went
to meet her sister every Saturday lunch time.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.522
What are you saying?

42:27.000 --> 42:30.800
You said it, not me.
There's a strangler on the prowl.

42:31.960 --> 42:33.849
And you think it's me?

42:34.000 --> 42:35.923
Sally Ann called me that night to baby-sit,

42:36.080 --> 42:38.606
because she couldn't get a hold of you at worn.

42:38.960 --> 42:41.930
Then you came home in the middle of the night
with a cut on your face.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.082
You were all weird.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.166
If you think I'm a killer why aren't you scared?

42:47.680 --> 42:49.569
- I am scared.
- Are you?

42:49.720 --> 42:50.846
Yes.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.480
- You think I'm gonna strangle you?
- Yes.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.642
And your little friend upstairs?

42:59.200 --> 43:02.807
Do you really think the killer
will identify himself so easily?

43:03.760 --> 43:05.762
Grow up, Katie.

43:22.280 --> 43:24.567
I'm just a husband, a father.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.447
A man with a profession to protect.

43:27.600 --> 43:31.571
Keep your crazy theories to yourself,
and stay away from my family.

45:39.160 --> 45:42.164
<i>You have reached the offices
of the Alice Monroe fund.</i>

45:42.640 --> 45:44.529
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

45:45.840 --> 45:48.320
I'm Paul Spector.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.408
We're finished here, ma'am.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.288
- Can you give me a couple more hours?
- I don't know, ma'am.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.442
We'll find the money.

48:43.160 --> 48:45.640
- I'm hungry.
- Well, you ate at Grandma's.

48:45.800 --> 48:48.883
- That was ages ago.
- I'll make you some warm milk, OK?

48:50.400 --> 48:54.405
Livvy, ten minutes to bedtime. Brush your teeth.

49:12.000 --> 49:17.245
<i>Dear Olivia, I'm sending this letter to you
all the way from Scotland via Pixie Post.</i>

49:17.400 --> 49:21.291
<i>I looked all day and all night,
but I couldn't find your dollies anywhere.</i>

49:21.440 --> 49:24.444
<i>It makes me think you took them
with you when you left.</i>

49:25.040 --> 49:27.805
<i>Are you sure
you checked your suitcase carefully?</i>

49:27.960 --> 49:30.645
<i>Have another look. Check the front pocket</i>

49:37.200 --> 49:38.804
<i>I will see you very soon.</i>

49:38.960 --> 49:41.327
<i>I love you best in the whole wide world.</i>

49:41.560 --> 49:43.005
<i>Daddy.</i>

49:43.160 --> 49:47.563
<i>PS. The Pixies prefer letters they deliver
to be kept a secret.</i>

50:36.240 --> 50:38.208
ls this hue?

50:38.360 --> 50:40.362
Well, it's in the paper, it must be.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.962
Why do you want to know?

50:46.120 --> 50:48.202
I did the autopsy on James Olson.

50:48.360 --> 50:50.567
I know. You showed me the pictures.

50:50.720 --> 50:54.850
I had no idea that you had
a personal relationship with him when I did that.

50:58.840 --> 51:01.446
There were scratches on his back...

51:02.320 --> 51:06.245
...consistent with marks left by fingernails -
fresh marks.

51:07.120 --> 51:09.441
The most obvious explanation was sex...

51:09.800 --> 51:12.087
and that suggestion was put to his wife and...

51:12.680 --> 51:14.682
she said she was not responsible.

51:16.320 --> 51:17.560
I see.

51:17.720 --> 51:19.882
And at no point did DCI Eastwood suggest

51:20.040 --> 51:23.169
that visiting you in your hotel room
was part of Olson's time line.

51:24.160 --> 51:26.811
So the marks went unaccounted for
in my report.

51:30.400 --> 51:32.402
I'm surprised by that.

51:33.120 --> 51:35.122
By What?

51:36.800 --> 51:38.802
By Eastwood withholding that.

51:42.200 --> 51:44.202
You didn't ask him to?

51:48.000 --> 51:50.002
No.

51:51.560 --> 51:53.369
Hm...

51:54.400 --> 51:57.404
So was it you? Made those marks?

52:04.680 --> 52:06.682
They don't feel sharp.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.682
No.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.002
Not any more.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.002
How did you come to meet him?

52:51.040 --> 52:54.169
I saw him, on the street...

52:55.040 --> 52:57.042
"at a crime scene.

52:58.200 --> 53:02.808
I thought I would be in Belfast for...
a week, maybe two.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.367
I didn't think he'd be shot the next night.

53:10.400 --> 53:13.882
I'm sorry he's dead...I really am.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.562
But it was one night.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.848
It didn't mean anything.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.288
Excuse me, ma'am.
The divers might have found something.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.131
Mummy. Mummy!

53:55.280 --> 53:57.282
Hm?

53:57.680 --> 53:59.682
I need the bathroom.

54:00.560 --> 54:03.131
- What?
- I need to do a wee.

54:04.560 --> 54:06.562
Ask Daddy.

54:07.240 --> 54:09.242
Where is he?

54:13.480 --> 54:15.482
I'm so tired, sweetheart.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.602
Who are you?

54:35.280 --> 54:37.521
Ssh. Don't wake Mummy.

54:39.920 --> 54:42.491
<i>Delta Seven, roger that.</i>

55:32.520 --> 55:36.206
- Are you a friend of Mummy's or Daddy's?
- Your mummy.

55:38.120 --> 55:40.202
What's your name?

55:41.200 --> 55:43.202
Peter.

55:50.840 --> 55:52.842
Peter Piper.

55:53.800 --> 55:55.848
"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.923
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

55:58.080 --> 55:59.923
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,

56:00.080 --> 56:02.970
where's the peck of pickled peppers
that Peter Piper picked?"

56:03.640 --> 56:06.530
That's called a tongue twister. You try.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.321
- Peter Piper picked a
- ..of pickled peppers.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.290
Where's the pickled peppers
that Peter Piper picked?

56:13.440 --> 56:15.044
Do it again, but do it faster.

56:15.200 --> 56:17.521
- Peter Piper picked a pepper, pick...
- Peppers.

56:17.680 --> 56:19.808
Where's the pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked?

56:19.960 --> 56:22.930
That's really good, just not too loud.
We don't wanna wake Mummy.

56:23.800 --> 56:26.531
- Where are you sleeping?
- I'll find somewhere.

56:28.640 --> 56:31.610
- Where's your room?
- I'll show you.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.721
- Where's Mummy sleeping?
- In there.

57:18.800 --> 57:20.928
Hm, that's nice.

57:25.440 --> 57:27.442
I'm sorry.

57:29.520 --> 57:31.522
Me too.

57:57.800 --> 58:01.600
I want you to come with me now.
I wanna talk to you.

58:04.360 --> 58:06.567
I don't wanna have to hurt you, Rose.

58:07.440 --> 58:09.761
I don't wanna have to hurt your beautiful family.

58:09.920 --> 58:11.410
But I will...

58:12.600 --> 58:15.365
I will if you scream or cry out when I release you.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.802
Do you understand?

58:19.600 --> 58:21.602
OK.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.244
One...two...three.

58:43.200 --> 58:45.202
Peter?
