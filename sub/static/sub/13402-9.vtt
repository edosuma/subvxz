00:02.430 --> 00:03.727
Noel's been in the middle
of everything

00:03.730 --> 00:05.266
that's been happening to us.

00:05.270 --> 00:06.897
He stole Mary Drake ’5 ﬁle.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.834
He burned as
out of the storm cellar

00:08.840 --> 00:10.762
and he probably k/l/ea’ Sara.
Noel Ka/m IE; AD.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.214
Hello, Hanna.

00:12.220 --> 00:13.664
We have a reason to believe
Nicole Gordon may be alive.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.706
I got you a ticket. I cashed in
our tickets to Italy.

00:16.710 --> 00:18.041
I don't know what to say.

00:18.050 --> 00:19.540
Once you get there, you will.

00:19.550 --> 00:21.643
Miss DiLaurentis,
this person that you married

00:21.650 --> 00:23.572
'is actually a man named
Archer Dunhill.‘

00:23.590 --> 00:25.785
He's wanted in the UK
for petty theft and fraud.

00:25.790 --> 00:27.417
I had applied
for the coaching position.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.752
'Cause I was just, uh,
interviewing another candidate.

00:29.760 --> 00:30.852
Paige.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.157
- I'm Marco.
- I'm leaving.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.184
1' 0b Viously did not know

00:33.200 --> 00:34.394
that you are a police officer.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.027
You're investigating
my friend's husband.

00:36.030 --> 00:37.998
_I wouldn't want
anything to get complicated.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.024
Okay.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.166
You haven't told

00:40.170 --> 00:41.865
anyone about us, have you?

00:41.870 --> 00:43.497
(Hanna)
You guys are never
gonna realize

00:43.510 --> 00:45.398
that Noel is the one
behind everyth/ng.

00:45.410 --> 00:47.776
The deal is on. I get you
the money, you give me the keys

00:47.780 --> 00:50.169
and then you forget
you ever heard from me.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.744
"Went to New York
to meet Lucas for work.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.274
Be back in a few days?"

00:55.280 --> 00:57.316
Do we really believe
that Hanna's in New York?

00:57.320 --> 00:59.242
Well, she and Lucas are starting
a business together.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.648
But why would she go now?

01:00.660 --> 01:02.514
She's the one
that's convinced Noel is A.D.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.259
and we're so _close
to naIIIng hIm.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.558
Because all we have is_ a bunch
of Circumstantial eVIdence.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.323
Right, which is why
we need her here

01:08.330 --> 01:10.150
so we can find
something more concrete.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.695
Okay, I'm gonna call her
and tell her to come back.

01:22.780 --> 01:25.305
[cell phone vibrating]

01:34.190 --> 01:35.657
He called when he landed.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.924
Any news about Nicole?

01:37.930 --> 01:40.649
The authorities said
they rescued four hostages

01:40.660 --> 01:43.049
but Ezra doesn't know
if Nicole's one of them yet.

01:43.070 --> 01:46.597
Oh, my God, this must be
overwhelming for him..

01:46.600 --> 01:48.192
...and for you.

01:49.870 --> 01:51.201
Did you get Hanna?

01:51.210 --> 01:53.235
Went to voicemail.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.456
We have every reason
to believe that Noel's A.D.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.849
We also know that AD. burned us
out of the storm cellar

02:11.860 --> 02:13.623
so we wouldn't know
the name of Mary's child.

02:13.630 --> 02:15.393
What're we saying,
that Noel is that child?

02:15.400 --> 02:17.652
Well, if we can prove it,
that's the evidence we need.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.194
Yeah, and another reason
that he would want

02:19.200 --> 02:20.758
to avenge Charlotte's death.

02:20.770 --> 02:22.738
I did some research, turns out
all adoptions of babies born

02:22.740 --> 02:26.062
at Radley went through the
County Family Services Court.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.707
I'm gonna go
to the courthouse when it opens

02:27.710 --> 02:30.099
and I'll find out
what I can about the adoption.

02:30.110 --> 02:31.873
Okay, great, I'll, um..

02:31.880 --> 02:33.507
I'll try to find out
where Noel lives and works

02:33.520 --> 02:35.078
then maybe I would
get some answers that way.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.843
I have my swim coach interview
in an hour

02:36.850 --> 02:39.114
so I'll come back after
when I'm done and help out.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.542
Okay.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.585
Let us know
when you hear from Hanna.

02:42.590 --> 02:44.455
Yeah, I will.

02:45.060 --> 02:46.789
[door opens]

02:46.800 --> 02:47.994
[door closes]

02:51.370 --> 02:53.122
My name is Hanna Marin.

02:53.140 --> 02:56.598
If you find this video before
I finish what I need to do

02:56.610 --> 02:58.805
something went terribly wrong.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.475
Please give this to the police.

03:04.850 --> 03:07.501
Got a secret_
can you keep it?

03:07.520 --> 03:10.045
Swear this one you'll save

03:10.050 --> 03:12.610
Better lock it
in your pocket

03:12.620 --> 03:15.214
Taking this one to the grave

03:15.220 --> 03:17.381
If I show you then I know

03:17.390 --> 03:20.382
You won't tell what I said

03:20.400 --> 03:22.595
'Cause two can keep a secret

03:22.600 --> 03:25.467
If one of them is dead

03:36.850 --> 03:38.602
[sighs]

03:38.610 --> 03:39.770
[knock on door]

03:46.620 --> 03:49.680
- Marco? Hi._
- Hey, you got a minute?

03:49.690 --> 03:52.420
Uh, yeah. Of course, come in.

03:55.330 --> 03:56.797
Stopped by Alison's
to give her an update.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.564
I saw your car outside,
so I thought I'd say hi.

03:59.570 --> 04:02.198
Uh, yeah, she's away for the day
on a school field trip.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.293
I know, Jason told me.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.766
Well, what's goin' on?

04:05.770 --> 04:08.238
Or if you'd prefer,
I can ask Jason.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.539
No, no, it's okay,
I can tell you.

04:11.550 --> 04:15.509
Archer fled to France a few days
ago on a fake passport.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.612
France?

04:16.620 --> 04:17.848
I know that's not the news

04:17.850 --> 04:19.715
you wanted to hear.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.518
The case is still open
but since he's overseas

04:22.520 --> 04:25.182
it's shifting
out of my jurisdiction.

04:25.190 --> 04:27.681
But there is one silver lining.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.327
What's that?

04:29.330 --> 04:30.649
Well, since
I'm not investigating

04:30.670 --> 04:32.865
your friend's husband anymore

04:32.870 --> 04:36.089
maybe now you can have
a meal with me.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.032
Um..

04:38.040 --> 04:40.338
...I'm not so sure that
that's a good idea.

04:40.340 --> 04:43.798
It's just dinner. Maybe wine.

04:43.810 --> 04:45.801
Not a marriage proposal.

04:45.810 --> 04:48.017
Unless you prefer brunch. I know
this place that just opened--

04:48.020 --> 04:51.012
It's not that. It's, um..

04:51.020 --> 04:52.282
Then what?

04:54.290 --> 04:58.386
The night that I met you,
I was..

04:58.390 --> 04:59.823
I was just kinda
getting out of a relationship

04:59.830 --> 05:02.958
and it was too soon then
andits"

05:02.970 --> 05:04.494
.. .1100 soon now.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.435
I get it.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.237
It's not the right time.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.662
Yeah.

05:15.410 --> 05:17.207
This has my cell on it.

05:17.210 --> 05:19.804
In case you change your mind.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.311
Give me a call.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.639
I will.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.383
Good.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.651
Good to see you.

05:29.660 --> 05:30.888
You too.

05:33.530 --> 05:34.849
[door closes]

05:38.930 --> 05:42.434
Someone woke up
with a sugar craving.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.964
Doesn't everyone
start out their day like this?

05:43.970 --> 05:45.335
[chuckles]

05:45.340 --> 05:48.036
No, we had a customer call
and order a red velvet cake

05:48.040 --> 05:49.678
for a special occasion, so..

05:49.680 --> 05:53.172
...I am testing out icing.

05:53.180 --> 05:55.444
Which one do you like better?

05:55.450 --> 05:57.645
[instrumental music]

05:58.550 --> 06:01.383
Noel Kahn? That's your customer?

06:01.390 --> 06:03.483
Yeah, you know him?

06:03.490 --> 06:05.958
Yeah, we went
to school together.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.521
Look. He's bad news, Sabrina,
please don't work with him.

06:09.530 --> 06:10.792
Well, I'm not gonna be
his best friend.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.869
I'm just making him a cake.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.497
Yeah, you shouldn't even
do that.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.639
Why, what's he gonna do?
Steal my pies?

06:15.640 --> 06:16.891
Write a bad Yelp review--

06:16.910 --> 06:20.129
I'm being serious.
I'm trying to protect you.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.835
Protect me from what?

06:21.840 --> 06:25.207
Just trust me
when I say that he's dangerous.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.303
Okay, look..

06:27.320 --> 06:28.639
I can't_talk about this
right now.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.049
I have to get to an interview.

06:30.050 --> 06:31.608
You can't say
something like that

06:31.620 --> 06:32.848
and then just walk away.

06:32.860 --> 06:33.940
I know, I'm sorry.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.587
I'll call you later.

06:37.090 --> 06:38.523
Okay.

06:45.070 --> 06:47.891
I ran into Emily at The Brew.
She said you were up here.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.936
Yeah, I was actually
just about to head out.

06:49.940 --> 06:51.805
Can we talk later?

06:51.810 --> 06:54.028
There was a fire at
my Aunt Carol's a few days ago.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.235
You know anything about it?

06:56.250 --> 06:57.831
No.

06:59.550 --> 07:01.609
Apparently, Ali went out there.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.043
Detective Furey said
Archer was out of the country

07:04.050 --> 07:06.518
but I think he's still here.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.078
I think he followed her
out there

07:08.090 --> 07:09.853
and tried to hurt her again.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.428
The fire was an accident.

07:17.430 --> 07:19.762
- Wait, so you were with her?
- Yeah.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.829
Ali asked me
not to say anything.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.262
Why not?

07:23.270 --> 07:28.003
We found some of your mom's
personal things in the cellar.

07:28.010 --> 07:29.409
What things?

07:29.410 --> 07:30.832
[sighs]

07:33.180 --> 07:36.308
Okay, we found
some paperwork that confirmed

07:36.320 --> 07:39.847
your mom was in charge
of Mary's care at Radley.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.954
She oversaw
Charlotte's adoption..

07:44.830 --> 07:48.550
...and Mary's other
child's adoption too.

07:50.230 --> 07:52.061
What other child?

07:52.070 --> 07:56.131
That was all we were able
to read before the fire started.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.062
Now, Mary won't answer
any of Ali's calls

07:58.070 --> 08:01.039
and she's, she's not staying
at the Lost Woods.

08:02.510 --> 08:05.308
I'm sure
there were more secrets.

08:05.310 --> 08:09.110
And I'm guessing my mom was
killed because of one of them.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.214
I promised Ali I'd find out
all I could about the adoption.

08:12.220 --> 08:16.350
I owe her that after everything
she's been through.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.524
[sighs]
I was just gonna head
to the courthouse right now.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.898
They won't give you
any information.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.492
Why not?

08:25.500 --> 08:27.263
You're not a relative.

08:29.140 --> 08:31.563
No, but you are.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.728

10:04.100 --> 10:05.761
You okay?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.462
Yeah.

10:07.470 --> 10:09.631
You're not having
second thoughts about applying

10:09.640 --> 10:11.835
because we're up
for the same job, are you?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.731
I don't feel great
about it, but..

10:15.740 --> 10:17.731
...that's not the issue.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.878
"Have you ever been arrested?"

10:20.880 --> 10:24.372
I have never filled
one of these things out before.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.982
Should I be honest or..

10:29.560 --> 10:31.312
[sighs]

10:31.330 --> 10:32.922
Hackett knows your history.

10:32.930 --> 10:35.797
He wouldn't have suggested
you apply if it was a problem.

10:38.670 --> 10:40.092
I'm just glad they don't have a

10:40.100 --> 10:42.534
"Have you ever committed
a crime" box.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.895
My answer would never fit
on two lines.

10:44.910 --> 10:48.334
Yeah, you probably need four.
Maybe five.

10:48.340 --> 10:50.570
I'm sure I've aided
and abetted a few of them.

10:50.580 --> 10:52.002
[chuckles]

10:53.880 --> 10:57.372
Forget about the past.
They need someone now.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.517
You'd make an excellent coach.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.387
You're a wonderful swimmer
and an even better person.

11:03.260 --> 11:04.909
The best I know.

11:13.070 --> 11:16.528
(woman on PA)
'Calling number five.
Number five..'

11:16.540 --> 11:17.666
'Calling number five.‘

11:17.670 --> 11:19.934
- It's not bad.
- Not bad?

11:19.940 --> 11:21.362
Door number five.

11:22.710 --> 11:24.803
DMV moves faster
than this place.

11:24.810 --> 11:27.199
Relax, I've been in places
where it takes a week

11:27.220 --> 11:29.677
to get an appointment
just to talk with the clerk.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.840
[chuckles]

11:31.850 --> 11:34.444
Here, got this
while you were in line.

11:35.890 --> 11:38.017
Sugar, dash of milk, right?

11:44.370 --> 11:47.362
[instrumental music]

11:52.570 --> 11:53.798
Morning.

11:53.810 --> 11:56.529
Mm, morning.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.869
Thank you.

12:05.590 --> 12:07.888
Aren't you gonna be late?

12:07.890 --> 12:10.950
My training is done.
I finished yesterday.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.757
Wow.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.888
- Three weeks went by fast.
-Hmm.

12:15.900 --> 12:19.495
So, what, what, that means
you're...going back soon?

12:19.500 --> 12:20.922
Next week.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.804
You know, I was thinking

12:27.810 --> 12:30.199
that maybe

12:30.210 --> 12:32.508
maybe you'd wanna come with me.

12:32.510 --> 12:34.398
To Ethiopia?

12:35.480 --> 12:36.777
What would I do there?

12:36.790 --> 12:38.781
Help people
who have bigger problems

12:38.790 --> 12:40.189
than we do.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.349
Yeah, it's-it's just
that traveling's

12:46.360 --> 12:48.089
not really part
of the plan right now

12:48.100 --> 12:51.126
I've got, like,
three job interviews this week.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.223
You just graduated, Aria.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.992
You have the rest
of your life to work.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.365
And, besides,
I think this would be

12:56.370 --> 12:58.463
a great experience
for us to share.

12:58.470 --> 13:01.234
Yeah. I'm-I'm sure it would be.

13:02.340 --> 13:05.343
[scoffs]
But I'm not
independently wealthy.

13:05.350 --> 13:06.840
I kinda need a job.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.977
My charity will pay for you.

13:08.980 --> 13:11.414
And you only have to stay
as long as you want.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.059
At least think about it.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.025
Yeah, I will.

13:25.300 --> 13:28.167
Okay. I gotta go
get ready for this interview.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.139
Too much sugar?

13:47.160 --> 13:50.118
No. No, it's perfect.

13:56.670 --> 13:57.921
[whistle blows]

13:58.630 --> 14:01.565
Hey. How did it go?

14:01.570 --> 14:03.094
Really good, actually.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.091
Yeah, Hackett saw that
some of the girls

14:05.110 --> 14:06.805
on the team have been bullied.

14:06.810 --> 14:09.404
So he thought
I'd be an asset to them.

14:09.410 --> 14:11.207
He's right.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.303
- When you going?
- Fifteen minutes.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.948
- Well, I know you'll do well.
- Thank you.

14:18.790 --> 14:20.781
Hey, was this your old locker?

14:20.790 --> 14:25.227
No. Um...this one was.

14:28.460 --> 14:32.328
Wow. This hallway
used to seem so big.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.868
Yeah. Our whole lives
were wrapped up in this place.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.861
I couldn't wait
to get out of here.

14:37.870 --> 14:39.667
Now I kinda wish
I could go back.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.035
Really?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.302
You miss being stalked

14:42.310 --> 14:43.834
and having acne
that won't go away?

14:43.850 --> 14:47.377
No, but there are some things
that I do miss.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.884
What are you doing later?
You wanna hang out?

14:53.890 --> 14:56.415
I'm probably gonna be
with Sabrina.

14:57.460 --> 15:00.623
Oh, I didn't know
you were seeing anyone.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.222
Yeah, it's new.

15:02.230 --> 15:04.323
I mean, she's really great.

15:05.730 --> 15:09.336
But I'm just starting to think
it's not gonna last.

15:09.770 --> 15:12.000
Why not?

15:12.010 --> 15:14.331
There's a lot
I can't share with her..

15:15.510 --> 15:17.808
...about my past.

15:17.810 --> 15:19.607
It's understandable.

15:20.850 --> 15:23.273
And present.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.078
What do you mean "Present?"

15:27.190 --> 15:28.657
Emily?

15:31.090 --> 15:33.081
It's happening again.

15:36.430 --> 15:39.399
Please don't ask me
any questions, okay?

15:43.410 --> 15:46.459
You found a way to include me
when we were in high school.

15:46.470 --> 15:47.903
Whoever you're with now,
you should be

15:47.910 --> 15:49.400
able to do the same.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.574
Yeah.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.156
Never sold these
to a chick before.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.218
Glad I could be your first.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.084
[cell phone vibrating]

16:09.260 --> 16:12.388
Emily, I got your messages.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.267
No, I'm in a meeting. I can't
talk now. I'll call you later.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.163
Now, look,
little bit goes a long way.

16:18.170 --> 16:20.638
One of those
should knock him out for hours.

16:25.450 --> 16:26.678
Good to know.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.679
Look, the reason
that I'm calling is

16:40.700 --> 16:42.190
because my mother
wanted me to send out

16:42.200 --> 16:43.519
a thank you note
to one of the donors

16:43.530 --> 16:45.566
but I-I've,
I've misplaced the address.

16:45.570 --> 16:48.061
Can you look it up
in the voter..

16:48.070 --> 16:50.436
_ ...in_the voter
registration database?

16:50.440 --> 16:53.307
Uh, yeah, the name's Noel Kahn.
I can wait.

16:54.410 --> 16:56.207
That's my mom's
campaign manager.

16:56.210 --> 16:57.279
Oh, good thinking.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.577
I don't know, it's a long shot.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.377
He might not even live
in the district anymore.

17:00.380 --> 17:02.211
Noel isn't the only one
we have to worry about.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.017
- I talked to Hanna.
- And?

17:04.020 --> 17:05.783
She said she was in a meeting
and then hung up

17:05.790 --> 17:07.246
before I could even say hello.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.716
Look, I know
when Hanna's lying to me

17:08.720 --> 17:09.789
and she's definitely lying.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.155
Well, we should call Lucas.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.422
See if he knows
what's going on with her.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.751
Yeah, I already did.
He hasn't responded yet.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.058
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

17:18.070 --> 17:21.028
You did?
Great. What's the address?

17:26.810 --> 17:29.529
Okay, thank you so much.

17:29.540 --> 17:31.201
[phone beeps]

17:31.210 --> 17:32.802
[laptop beeping]

17:34.450 --> 17:36.418
(Emily)
'That's Noel's parents' cabin.‘

17:37.250 --> 17:40.617
- Oh, my God.
- What?

17:40.620 --> 17:43.259
That's the same area
where Hanna was held captive.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.728
How did we not
put this together sooner?

17:52.730 --> 17:54.925
Well, I thought his parents
sold this place years ago.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.567
Hey, God only knows
what's inside.

17:56.570 --> 17:59.209
Hopefully, the evidence we need
to finally end this thing.

18:00.940 --> 18:02.339
What are you doing?

18:02.340 --> 18:04.274
I'm breaking in.
His car isn't here.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.908
Yeah, but what if
somebody's inside?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.672
Only one way to find out.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.215
[machine whirring]

18:16.320 --> 18:18.151
Does that sound
remind you of anything?

18:18.160 --> 18:19.821
Yeah, the bunker.

18:25.700 --> 18:26.894
Look.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.107
Hey, come on.
We have to hurry up.

18:37.010 --> 18:39.149
(man on PA)
'Number 67, number 67..'

18:39.150 --> 18:41.471
Hey, they called our number.

18:43.020 --> 18:45.648
We lose our spot,
we'll be sleeping here tonight.

18:49.660 --> 18:50.888
Yeah, let's go.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.351
How can I help you?

18:58.370 --> 19:00.725
Um, I just found out
that my cousin was born

19:00.740 --> 19:03.197
in Radley Sanitarium
23 years ago.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.566
Uh, this court
facilitated the adoption.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.458
I don't know the gender, but
I know the birth mother's name.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.277
How can I get a copy
of the adoption records?

19:09.280 --> 19:10.804
You can't,
you're not the adoptee

19:10.810 --> 19:12.209
or parent of the adoptee.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.508
I understand, but we don't know
who the father is

19:14.520 --> 19:16.613
and the mother's
nowhere to be found.

19:16.620 --> 19:18.815
I wish there was something
I could do.

19:20.020 --> 19:22.045
Actually, there is something
you can do.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.516
Excuse me?

19:26.260 --> 19:29.297
Jason's mother is dead,
his dad disappeared

19:29.300 --> 19:31.359
his other cousin was murdered
a few weeks ago

19:31.370 --> 19:33.122
and his only other sibling
was just released

19:33.130 --> 19:35.064
from a psychiatric hospital.

19:35.070 --> 19:38.267
So he's really desperate to
connect to some family right now

19:38.270 --> 19:41.865
and finding this cousin
would mean everything to him.

19:42.980 --> 19:45.232
Please, help him.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.180
You're lucky to have a fiance
who cares so much.

19:54.020 --> 19:56.215
Yeah, she's really special.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.021
All Radley adoptions
were closed adoptions

20:01.030 --> 20:03.453
which means I can't access them
in this database.

20:03.460 --> 20:05.599
- Where are they?
- Well, in the archives room.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.363
They haven't been digitized yet.

20:10.670 --> 20:12.558
I'm not promising anything,
but I'll see

20:12.570 --> 20:15.038
what I can find
by the end of the day.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.928
Great. Thank you.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.952
[instrumental music]

21:01.560 --> 21:03.619
I've looked everywhere.
Nothing. You?

21:03.630 --> 21:05.552
No, I didn't see any room
like Hanna described

21:05.560 --> 21:07.323
and nothing that leads him
to being A.D.

21:07.330 --> 21:09.525
Okay, but there's got to be
something here, right?

21:09.530 --> 21:11.054
Let's check his bedroom
one more time.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.992
Go through everything carefully.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.108
What is that?

21:31.120 --> 21:34.317
It's the same stamp
that Maya had on her wrist

21:34.320 --> 21:36.481
in those pictures
from years ago.

21:36.490 --> 21:39.027
Yeah, that got you
into Eric Kahn's parties.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.399
Charlotte took me to one.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.768
Maybe this has pictures on it
from those parties.

21:49.770 --> 21:52.967
Yeah, or pictures that Noel took
of Hanna when he tortured her.

21:59.450 --> 22:02.647
[instrumental music]

22:15.900 --> 22:17.856
(Emily)
'It's the Dollhouse.‘

22:28.340 --> 22:30.001
'Oh, my God!‘

22:30.850 --> 22:32.602
'It's Noel.‘

22:43.660 --> 22:45.958
I really thought
that I hurt someone.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.656
Now you know you didn't.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.034
Noel Kahn was there
the whole time?

22:57.040 --> 22:58.792
He was helping Charlotte?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.733
We may not be able to prove
that he tortured Hanna

23:02.740 --> 23:04.298
'but this proves
that he tortured us'

23:04.310 --> 23:05.971
'and he's gonna go to jail
for that.‘

23:05.980 --> 23:07.845
[thunder rumbling]

23:08.850 --> 23:11.478
Come on, Spencer,
let's get out of here.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.013
Grab that. Come on.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.528
Have you looked at
any of the other folders?

23:21.530 --> 23:24.693
No. You, you can, if you want.

23:24.700 --> 23:28.363
No, I don't wanna see
any of that footage, ever.

23:28.370 --> 23:30.964
Yeah, well, the only people
who need to see are the police.

23:30.970 --> 23:33.359
Well, we can't give it
to them without Hanna.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.735
We need to be together for this.

23:34.740 --> 23:36.628
Yes, in theory,
but we have no idea

23:36.640 --> 23:37.937
when she's gonna be back.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.178
Or where she is.

23:39.180 --> 23:41.774
That was Lucas.
He said he's not with Hanna.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.475
They never had plans
to meet in New York.

23:43.480 --> 23:44.515
[thunder rumbling]

23:44.520 --> 23:45.817
Where the hell is she?

23:45.820 --> 23:47.412
She wanted to turn Noel in
last night

23:47.420 --> 23:49.012
and we didn't listen to her.

23:49.020 --> 23:50.783
Okay, but if she was gonna go
to the police on her own

23:50.790 --> 23:53.350
she would've done it already.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.521
Maybe she's with Mona?

23:55.530 --> 23:57.293
Or Caleb.

23:57.300 --> 23:58.824
[knock on door]

24:04.170 --> 24:06.604
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:08.310 --> 24:09.629
Um..

24:11.610 --> 24:14.807
[indistinct chatter]

24:20.960 --> 24:22.951
[cell phone rings]

24:35.000 --> 24:36.228
[sighs]

24:43.950 --> 24:46.942
[intense music]

25:06.330 --> 25:07.467
What's going on?

25:07.470 --> 25:09.233
Uh, Spencer and Aria
are just inside

25:09.240 --> 25:11.891
so just thought it'd be better
if we talked out here.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.764
Okay, um..

25:13.770 --> 25:15.431
Well, I'm just
on a break at work

25:15.440 --> 25:16.976
and I thought
I'd come by and see

25:16.980 --> 25:18.902
if you wanted to go
grab a quick bite?

25:18.910 --> 25:22.778
Oh, yeah, I'd love to,
but I can't right now.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.885
Why not?

25:25.890 --> 25:27.517
Uh..

25:27.520 --> 25:29.454
First, you were weird
about that whole

25:29.460 --> 25:31.985
Noel Kahn guy this morning

25:31.990 --> 25:33.719
and now this.

25:33.730 --> 25:35.379
What's going on, Emily?

25:35.400 --> 25:36.651
I wish I could tell you.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.127
I'm not trying to pry

25:38.130 --> 25:41.190
I know that you've been through
a lot in your life

25:41.200 --> 25:45.068
and you're extremely protective
and rightfully so.

25:45.070 --> 25:48.608
But nothing you can say
is gonna scare me away.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.235
Look, I'm sorry. Okay?

25:52.250 --> 25:54.639
I-I'm just in the middle
of something right now.

25:54.650 --> 25:56.618
A-a-and if all goes well tonight

25:56.620 --> 25:59.214
I can explain everything
to you tomorrow.

25:59.220 --> 26:03.156
Okay. Just...be patient with me.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.309
Please.

26:06.890 --> 26:09.620
- Okay.
- Thank you.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.419
Cupcakes, red velvet.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.192
I made them for you.

26:18.370 --> 26:19.803
Thanks.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.377
Hanna is not picking up

26:28.380 --> 26:29.745
and she's not with Mona.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.877
Or Caleb, but she did drop by
his place last night

26:31.890 --> 26:33.744
to tell him that she would be
going off the grid

26:33.750 --> 26:34.819
for a couple of days.

26:34.820 --> 26:37.288
She's gonna do something
to Noel.

26:37.290 --> 26:38.712
- Like what?

26:38.730 --> 26:40.288
Well, whatever it is,
she's gonna do it alone

26:40.290 --> 26:41.985
because she thought
that we wouldn't help her.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.797
Okay, well,
we really need to find her

26:43.800 --> 26:45.358
before she does
something stupid.

26:45.370 --> 26:48.225
He's trying to track her down
on her phone right now.

26:49.270 --> 26:50.669
And in the meantime?

26:50.670 --> 26:52.160
In the meantime,
we go to the police.

26:52.170 --> 26:54.263
- We tell them everything.
- Tell them what?

26:54.280 --> 26:55.759
That Hanna said
she was gonna be in New York

26:55.780 --> 26:57.372
but we think she's here,
hunting down Noel

26:57.380 --> 26:58.836
like it's "The Hunger Games?"

26:58.850 --> 27:02.240
Uh, no. 1-1 think we wait
and see if Caleb can find her.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.013

Thank you for letting me know.

27:17.230 --> 27:18.822
Sorry, guys,
that was my neighbor.

27:18.830 --> 27:20.491
My mom's car alarm is going off
'cause of this storm

27:20.500 --> 27:22.798
so I just have to go
get the keys and shut it off.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.131
I'm gonna go to Jason's

27:24.140 --> 27:26.768
see if he got a hold of
those adoption records.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.067
And the more we have
against Noel

27:28.080 --> 27:29.433
when we go to the police,
the better.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.998
And let us know
if Caleb finds her.

I know you killed Sara.

Oh, you got it all wrong.

28:06.610 --> 28:09.078
Didn't you hear?
Sara fell in the shower.

28:10.380 --> 28:12.985
Then why did you have her phone?

28:12.990 --> 28:16.710
Why drive all the way down
to the city to dump it?

28:16.720 --> 28:20.679
And then come here
to try to get it back?

28:21.930 --> 28:23.795
What do you want, Hanna?

28:25.000 --> 28:28.720
The police are suspecting
that there was foul play.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.334
They wanna question me.

28:31.340 --> 28:33.706
Sara died in my mom's hotel.

28:33.710 --> 28:36.679
They know about her past.

28:36.680 --> 28:39.501
And that someone
took Sara's room key

28:39.510 --> 28:41.273
from the concierge desk.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.477
Well, that doesn't sound
very good...for you.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.878
Or you.

28:46.820 --> 28:49.687
The cellphone was a big screw-up

28:49.690 --> 28:53.126

from this clean.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.528
Hmm.

After the police talk to me

29:01.070 --> 29:04.938
they'll...question other guests.

29:04.940 --> 29:07.431
I wasn't in the hotel
when it happened.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.169
I went to see a movie.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.432
At my place.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.873
We watched "Birdman," right?

You help me...I help you.

29:26.860 --> 29:28.919

Can you please come over
as soon as you get this?

about 20 minutes ago.

Have you heard
from the county clerk?

No. I haven't, but she said
she has to fax over the report

32:59.440 --> 33:01.465
and we need the power for that.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.334
Yeah, that's
if she sends it over.

33:03.340 --> 33:06.798
I think she will.
Thanks to you.

to channel my frustration.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.854
Look, I know about Nicole

33:22.860 --> 33:25.124
that she might still be alive.

Ezra went to Colombia.

That's not gonna change.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.155

34:00.030 --> 34:01.122
If she hadn't gone missing

34:01.140 --> 34:02.994
they'd probably
still be together.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.592
You don't know that.

34:06.470 --> 34:09.667
And what if I was just
his consolation prize?

No.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.172
Don't believe that for a second.

And they're working with him
on his next one too, right?

Okay, well,
that's just a coincidence.

in years.

why I took that job.

35:37.830 --> 35:40.469
hoping that it'd bring me
and Ezra back together.

35:43.770 --> 35:46.159
Well, if Nicole is alive
and Ezra goes back to her

35:46.170 --> 35:48.138
then it's his loss.

I can't imagine
there's anyone better than you.
