WEBVTT

00:03.471 --> 00:06.140
Veterans and guardians,
gather round, please.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.209
I hope you enjoyed
the indoor exhibit.

00:08.242 --> 00:11.212
Now we'll take the next
20 minutes to explore out here,

00:11.245 --> 00:13.281
then we'll head over
to the Vietnam Memorial Wall.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.349
Back here in 20.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.185
Where'd you say
you're in from?

00:17.218 --> 00:19.220
Outside of Phoenix.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.822
River Assault Squadron 9
at Vung Tau in '67.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.257
You?

00:23.291 --> 00:24.825
I come from Minneapolis.

00:24.858 --> 00:28.796
1st Infantry Division,
round about '68, Saigon.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.498
Seeing the wall
should be something, huh?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.200
Yeah.

00:32.233 --> 00:36.204
I've been waiting
for this a long time.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.339
"Excuse me"

00:38.372 --> 00:40.741
would go a long way
there, friend!

00:40.774 --> 00:42.510
He's with us?

00:42.543 --> 00:45.746
Yeah. I tried to introduce
myself to him this morning.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.348
He told me
to mind my own business.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.417
(chuckles)
Geez.
WOMAN: Taxi!

00:49.450 --> 00:51.185
Hey, hey, I got here first!

00:51.219 --> 00:53.187
I hate to do this,
but I am already late.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.255
Please, I will
lose my job.
Henry!

00:54.288 --> 00:57.091
Henry.
Kid, I already told you,

00:57.125 --> 00:58.092
I got to get
out of here.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.327
What are you doing, Henry?

00:59.360 --> 01:01.129
The tour's
not even half over yet.

01:01.162 --> 01:04.232
Listening to a bunch of fossils
talk Viet Cong is debilitating.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.600
Don't you want to see
your memorial?

01:06.634 --> 01:09.403
(scoffs)
You take a minute
to talk to these guys,

01:09.437 --> 01:11.205
you might even make a friend
before we get there.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.241
Friends are for people who think
ordering a piece of pie

01:13.274 --> 01:15.309
with two forks is a good idea.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.644
(gasps)

01:16.677 --> 01:18.512
Hey. Hey, kid.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.581
Hey, you okay? Hey...

01:20.614 --> 01:22.316
Kid, are you...?

01:22.350 --> 01:24.485
Help!

01:25.719 --> 01:27.855
Any of you guys a medic?! Medic!

01:29.890 --> 01:32.726
*

02:02.390 --> 02:03.591
Bishop, you're here, good.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.227
Yes, I lost
the bet, Tim.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.230
I failed to get Gibbs
to try a tofu steak.

02:09.263 --> 02:12.400
And, yes, I will buy
everyone drinks tonight.
No, no, no, no, no.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.235
Forget about all that.
Where are Torres and Quinn?

02:14.268 --> 02:16.270
I don't know.
They're not here yet.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.539
Your eyes are bulge-y.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.741
It's 'cause I got big news.
I got big news.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.910
I'm talking big, like whoa.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.612
Use your words, Tim.
Okay. All right.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.747
You know my friend Val?
REACT Team Val, yeah.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.249
Had dinner with her
last night, all right?

02:28.282 --> 02:30.318
She did Basic School
at FLETC the same time

02:30.351 --> 02:33.287
that Torres was there, and Quinn
was one of their instructors.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.755
So?
So, Val said

02:34.788 --> 02:36.590
that, during one
of the weeks of training,

02:36.624 --> 02:38.326
Torres and Quinn had a fling.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.294
No.
Yes, they did.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.463
It's true. Val said
it was over quick, but, I mean,

02:42.496 --> 02:44.565
we're talking sweaty, Top Gun,

02:44.598 --> 02:46.967
hotshot rookie,
sexy instructor...

02:47.000 --> 02:48.202
No.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.339
No. I mean, I don't...

02:51.372 --> 02:52.906
I just can't even...

02:52.940 --> 02:53.974
Use your words, Bishop.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.809
Okay, if it did happen--

02:55.843 --> 02:57.478
and that is a big if--

02:57.511 --> 03:00.748
I wonder if Top Gun
beach volleyball was involved.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.651
Because I can totally picture
Torres running around

03:03.684 --> 03:05.486
in the sand in tight jeans.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.288
Fantasize on your own time,
Bishop.

03:07.321 --> 03:10.358
Uh, no, Gibbs, that wasn't
about me picturing Torres...

03:10.391 --> 03:11.359
Got a dead Marine in D.C.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.361
Gearing up.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.729
Call Quinn and Tight Jeans.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.431
Tell 'em to meet us there.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.433
(sighs)

03:19.467 --> 03:20.934
TORRES: Can I get everyone
to step aside, please?

03:20.968 --> 03:22.436
Step aside. Thank you.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.372
QUINN: And all of you
came here together?

03:24.405 --> 03:27.541
This is my niece, Gayle.
She's my escort on this trip.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.543
Phil here has his neighbor
with him.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.712
But none of us
is gonna be much help.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.881
Corporal Beck
seemed nice enough,

03:33.914 --> 03:35.783
but he was escorting
that wet blanket.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.017
Uh, Henry Rogers?

03:37.050 --> 03:39.420
He had no interest
in getting to know anyone.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.589
He stayed apart
from the group all morning,

03:41.622 --> 03:43.524
so the corporal had
to do the same.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.793
All right. Understood.
Thank you. Ooh.

03:45.826 --> 03:46.827
Okay, I got you.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.398
All right,
thank you, guys, very much.
Thanks, guys.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.800
Bishop, Bishop, did you see
that, with the notepad?
Hmm?

03:52.833 --> 03:54.468
He was being nice.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.703
No, he brushed his
hand against her

03:55.736 --> 03:57.705
when he handed it back.
He did not.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.374
I'm telling you, Bishop.
Sweaty fling of the century.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.610
Definitely happened.
QUINN:
So, all the vets were
on an Honor Flight trip?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.612
Honor Flight Network
is a nonprofit.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.615
We transport veterans
to D.C. free of charge

04:07.648 --> 04:09.517
to visit
their memorials--

04:09.550 --> 04:11.352
World War II, Korea.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.521
Today's group served in Vietnam.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.390
I understand, uh, Corporal Beck
was a volunteer escort.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.792
We require all vets to have
a guardian for the trip.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.462
Usually, it's a family member
or a friend.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.064
But Corporal Beck asked
to be paired with someone

04:24.097 --> 04:25.666
who didn't have a volunteer.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.501
Nice thing to do.
I didn't know him well,

04:27.535 --> 04:29.703
but you could tell
he was one of the good ones.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.506
Look, I-I know you have a job
to do, but I...

04:32.540 --> 04:34.041
Yeah, yeah, you're in
the middle of the tour.

04:34.074 --> 04:37.345
Some of these men have been
on our waiting list for years,

04:37.378 --> 04:38.646
and I don't want them
to miss their chance

04:38.679 --> 04:40.448
to see their memorial.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.683
GIBBS:
What do we know, Duck?

04:42.716 --> 04:45.686
Paramedics surmise
heart attack.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.688
Why call us?

04:47.721 --> 04:51.091
Well, as you know, Jethro,
in many military circles,

04:51.124 --> 04:54.094
having "seen the elephant"
is a metaphor

04:54.127 --> 04:56.530
for having experienced combat.

04:56.564 --> 05:00.100
I was in Laos on exchange
with the U.S. forces.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.937
That's where I actually saw
an elephant.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.340
Yeah, it was
transporting supplies

05:06.374 --> 05:07.641
for the North Vietnamese.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.976
Does the elephant have a point?

05:09.009 --> 05:10.611
Oh, yes. Often, there is

05:10.644 --> 05:13.447
more than one type of beast
lurking in the jungle.

05:13.481 --> 05:17.785
First responders noted foaming
at Corporal Beck's mouth.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.087
That suggests
there's more to this story

05:20.120 --> 05:23.023
than just a heart attack.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.925
GIBBS:
That a coffee stain?

05:24.958 --> 05:26.460
Well, it could be.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.696
Nothing is certain
till I get him back to Autopsy.

05:28.729 --> 05:29.997
Well, let's get him back.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.834
We finished the interviews.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.503
Only witness who
might know something

05:35.536 --> 05:37.838
is the vet Corporal
Beck was assigned to.

05:37.871 --> 05:41.509
Now, he was with Beck all
morning, away from the group.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.377
Name is Henry Rogers,

05:43.411 --> 05:44.978
former Marine sergeant,
Force Recon.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.847
The guy's a handful.
Did he, uh, eat something,

05:46.880 --> 05:48.516
drink anything?
Let me lay it down

05:48.549 --> 05:51.552
for you real simple.
I answered your questions.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.554
Now I'm done.
Sir, we can't release you
just yet.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.988
GIBBS: We're looking
into the death

05:55.022 --> 05:56.490
of a fellow Marine here.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.426
I know that.
The death
is looking suspicious.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.929
You're a key witness, Sergeant.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.931
We need you with us.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.066
Suspicious how?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.402
DUCKY:
It's a microscopic dart.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.637
Where'd it come from?

06:09.670 --> 06:12.573
I extracted it
from Corporal Beck's arm here.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.476
This contusion alerted me
to the injection site.

06:15.509 --> 06:18.812
The dart is designed to be left
behind, beneath the dermis.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.649
It's so small,
sharp, and thin

06:21.682 --> 06:22.883
that it would've felt like,

06:22.916 --> 06:24.952
well, nothing more
than a bug bite.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.987
Botulinum toxin.

06:27.020 --> 06:27.921
What?

06:27.955 --> 06:28.956
He didn't ask yet?

06:28.989 --> 06:30.524
Mere seconds away.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.525
(scoffs)

06:31.559 --> 06:32.660
ABBY: My timing
is off today.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.694
Abbs, what was in the dart?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.496
Now is when I was supposed
to swoosh in and say...

06:35.529 --> 06:37.130
Botulinum toxin.

06:37.164 --> 06:40.901
The most poisonous
natural substance known to man.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.503
Botulinum was
the main ingredient,

06:42.536 --> 06:44.538
but the injection was
a mixture of inhibitors...

06:44.572 --> 06:46.106
Abbs, less words.

06:46.139 --> 06:50.110
Uh, it... has stuff in it

06:50.143 --> 06:52.680
that mask the symptoms
of the poison.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.548
So it hit all at once.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.783
ABBY: Yeah,
and it hit hard.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.951
I mean, there's people all over
the Dark Web that are selling

06:57.985 --> 06:59.587
this kind of concoction,

06:59.620 --> 07:04.024
along with compressed-air guns
to fire it into the skin.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.526
I mean, they only work
at close range,

07:05.559 --> 07:07.661
but they're
even selling silencers.

07:07.695 --> 07:11.465
A discreet killing device
in the palm of one's hand.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.065
Exactly.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.534
And there's

07:13.567 --> 07:15.936
no way to trace
who's buying them.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.014
(phone rings)
Quinn.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.015
Yeah, Torres.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.550
Can you hang on a second?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.485
Hang on for what?
Wh-Where are you?

07:31.519 --> 07:33.487
BISHOP: Got it.
Thanks for the info.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.656
So... (clears throat)
What?

07:35.689 --> 07:37.991
What are you doing?
Mm. Quinn's calls last
an average of three minutes.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.893
We have to be quick.
Did you find something out?

07:39.927 --> 07:42.896
Uh-huh. I trained at FLETC
with an Agent Oswald Krukowski.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.733
As we speak, Krukowski is
at the Singapore Field Office

07:45.766 --> 07:47.034
with an Agent Matthew Katz.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.170
Katz was
in Torres' class at FLETC.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.839
Why didn't you just say
"a friend of a friend"?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.173
McGee, two minutes
and counting.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.142
Okay, so talk.
Fling or no fling?

07:55.175 --> 07:56.143
Fling.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.578
Oh.
Uh-huh.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.580
Just got off the phone
with Katz. He had details.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.614
Like what?

08:00.648 --> 08:02.082
Karaoke competition.
Local bar.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.251
The entire FLETC class
was there.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.688
Word is, Quinn saw Torres
perform that night.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.523
She couldn't resist him.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.792
Wait, did he sing "You've Lost
that Lovin' Feelin'"?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.627
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.629
What are you gonna find out?
Find out what?
What?

08:15.663 --> 08:16.630
Nothing.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.798
Okay.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.533
Um, that was Torres
on the phone.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.168
He needs backup
in the conference room.

08:21.201 --> 08:24.137
This guy Henry
is apparently a handful, so...

08:24.171 --> 08:25.272
I'm on it.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.007
Update. Let's go.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.176
Corporal Andrew Beck, 25.

08:29.209 --> 08:32.145
QUINN: Squeaky clean. Worked
in Base Logistics at Quantico.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.982
Honor Flight Network
wasn't the only place
he volunteered either.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.650
No, he was also
at Children's Hospital

08:36.684 --> 08:38.886
and Metro Ties
Crisis Center.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.153
More than clean. I got it.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.189
McGEE: Talked
to Beck's girlfriend.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.725
A guy claiming to be
from his work called his
house looking for him.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.627
Girlfriend reminded him
that Beck had a few days off

08:46.660 --> 08:48.562
for the Honor Flight trip.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.664
Call came from a spoofed number,
untraceable.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.866
Killer looking
for his location?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.935
Well, had to get close enough
to fire the dart.

08:54.968 --> 08:55.936
McGEE: Abby and Ducky say
it's impossible

08:55.969 --> 08:58.639
to pinpoint an exact time
of the injection.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.074
Could've happened any time
up to two hours before he died.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.342
QUINN: The tour
had already started.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.244
They were walking
in and out of people,

09:04.277 --> 09:06.213
weaving through crowds.
Killer could've been anyone.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.815
McGEE:
Yeah, but Henry Rogers

09:07.848 --> 09:09.282
was at Beck's side
the entire time.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.218
He's our best witness,
even if he doesn't realize

09:11.251 --> 09:13.220
what he knows.
I don't think

09:13.253 --> 09:14.922
we're gonna get anything out
of him, though.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.090
Guy's a handful.
HENRY: I'll tell you what,

09:17.124 --> 09:19.259
I am not gonna wait around
all day in some table room

09:19.292 --> 09:20.894
while you people
get your act together.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.830
What's a table room?
Look around, Sparky.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.232
It's a room built for nothing
but a table. Idiotic.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.266
Mr. Rogers...

09:26.299 --> 09:27.134
I've told you twice, it's Henry.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.268
I have nothing
in common

09:28.301 --> 09:29.903
with
that sweater-wearing pacifist.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.071
Oh, I wish you did.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.673
What?
Nothing.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.374
BISHOP:
Henry, Corporal Beck

09:34.407 --> 09:36.209
flew to Nebraska to pick you up.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.145
Yeah. Honor Flight rules.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.813
I told 'em I didn't need
a babysitter.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.281
Yeah, but-- and he was gonna
escort you home

09:41.314 --> 09:43.250
after spending the day
with you here.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.653
I mean, don't you owe him
a little compassion?

09:45.686 --> 09:46.987
I just met him yesterday.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.758
But, yeah...

09:50.791 --> 09:52.793
I feel bad for him.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.864
He was a good kid, and he...

09:58.331 --> 10:01.034
Okay.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.271
(sighs)

10:04.304 --> 10:06.039
Ask me something.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.842
Do you remember anyone getting
close enough to inject him

10:08.876 --> 10:10.678
during the two hours
before he died?

10:10.711 --> 10:13.246
Inject him?
Yep, he was poisoned.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.785
That fancy-coffee nut.
Who?

10:17.818 --> 10:20.053
Some worker was pouring coffee
like a maniac.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.289
She bumped into him, spilled
a frap-o-drink everywhere.

10:22.322 --> 10:26.694
Corporal Beck had a coffee stain
on his, on his jacket.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.328
What's the name of the place?
It was so crowded,

10:28.361 --> 10:30.664
the kid and I had to go outside
after we got our drip,

10:30.698 --> 10:32.299
so the rest of the group
could get theirs.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.901
Then it starts to rain.
Henry, the name of the place?

10:33.934 --> 10:37.170
Dr. Joe's Turn Your Head
and Coffee.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.972
Huh?

10:39.006 --> 10:41.074
Uh-huh?
How's that for a name, huh?

10:41.108 --> 10:44.311
Damn fancy-joe nut-jobs.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.313
Uh, where are you going?
I helped you.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.181
I told you what I know.
I got room service to order.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.017
You know where to find me.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.318
We can't let you leave just yet.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.186
We may need you
to I.D. someone.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.422
Yeah, we need you to stay here
for now.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.735
If it weren't for my back, I'd
have you crying in the corner.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.803
I believe you.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.706
Guess I'll just hang around
the table room.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.214
Officer Reeves, MI6
has made it abundantly clear,

11:21.248 --> 11:24.317
they want you back.
When do I leave, sir?

11:24.351 --> 11:27.287
You forgot to mention how
parting is such sweet sorrow.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.189
I don't mean to sound
unappreciative, I just...

11:29.222 --> 11:31.158
You're not going anywhere.

11:31.191 --> 11:35.128
MI6 currently has two of our
agents on loan,

11:35.162 --> 11:37.497
acting as
international liaisons.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.499
I thought it might be
beneficial to keep you here

11:39.532 --> 11:42.836
in a similar capacity, and your
people have begrudgingly agreed.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.005
What does than mean exactly?
Keep doing what you're doing.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.774
VANCE:
International investigations.

11:46.807 --> 11:50.043
Your desk stays the same.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.514
Is there a problem?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.349
If it's all
the same to you,

11:56.383 --> 11:57.918
I'd prefer something high-risk.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.486
You want another Willoughby.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.054
It's what I'm good at, really.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.490
I'll see what I can do.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.925
Thank you, sir.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.126
And maybe, until
I hear from you,

12:06.159 --> 12:08.095
I shouldn't get
too tied up.

12:08.128 --> 12:11.131
I'm thinking some temporary
solo work would be good.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.300
Give me a chance to mentally
prepare for something big.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.902
Would you like to sit at my desk

12:14.935 --> 12:16.469
while you're thinking
above your pay grade?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.839
I got something.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.541
A witness.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.510
Honor Flight
transferred custody to us.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.278
A Vietnam vet,

12:25.312 --> 12:26.980
waited three years
to see the Wall.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.316
He's missing his chance
because of this case.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.350
Perfect.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.285
I'll take him to the memorial

12:32.319 --> 12:33.453
and wherever else
he wants to go.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.788
And by the time I'm done,

12:34.822 --> 12:35.923
you'll have my
new assignment.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.457
Is that a question or an order?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.159
A question?
Get out of here.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.829
I appreciate it,

12:41.862 --> 12:44.131
you setting me
on the easy track for now.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.166
Get Bishop and Torres
to brief you.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.302
RECEPTIONIST:
Director Vance's office.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.438
May I help you?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.045
HENRY:
I don't want to go to the Wall,
you hear me?

12:58.078 --> 12:59.446
I thought that's
why you were here,

12:59.479 --> 13:00.981
to see your memorial, yeah?

13:01.014 --> 13:02.482
I said, I don't want to go.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.051
(laughing):
Then why'd you
get on the plane?

13:04.084 --> 13:05.552
Believe me, if I'd known
I was gonna end up

13:05.585 --> 13:07.420
with a leprechaun who wears
his pants too short,

13:07.454 --> 13:09.056
I wouldn't have.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.924
Leprechauns are Irish.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.360
A non-American escort for a trip
about patriotism.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.495
This stuff only happens to me.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.330
You just said you didn't want
to do the patriotic part.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.899
You think wanting
to be left alone

13:18.932 --> 13:20.400
is not patriotic?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.035
That is the whole reason
we beat down

13:22.069 --> 13:25.172
your kind in the Revolution.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.075
Just take me back
to the hotel, will you?

13:28.108 --> 13:30.844
My back is screaming,
and I want room service.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.045
Fine.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.214
Alone.
Not happening.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.183
I've been required to
have eyes on you at all times.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.251
You've been tagged
as a flight risk.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.519
What kind of people
raised you

13:39.552 --> 13:40.420
to believe everything
you're told?

13:43.891 --> 13:46.226
What's the matter,
your folks are dead?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.527
Join the club.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.999
I'm sorry.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.502
Look,

13:55.535 --> 13:57.204
I can take you
back to the hotel,

13:57.237 --> 13:59.539
but I can't leave
you alone, all right?

14:04.411 --> 14:06.646
Bloody hell.

14:06.679 --> 14:10.317
You notice McGee and,
and Bishop acting weird?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.119
Nerds are weird.

14:12.152 --> 14:15.155
No, no, th-they were looking
at us funny at the crime scene

14:15.188 --> 14:17.557
and in the squad room.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.027
I'm telling you, something's
going on, and it's about us.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.362
Is that her?

14:22.395 --> 14:24.364
Oh, hey, uh, what gave it away?

14:24.397 --> 14:26.466
Is it the enormous coffee stain
on her shirt?

14:26.499 --> 14:29.502
Hey. NCIS.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.437
Here to ask you
a couple of questions.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.671
NCIS?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.206
We're out of
the paprika-iced.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.908
Okay, can you stop
moving one second?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.677
How did you get
the stain on your shirt?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.579
A guy got in my way
this morning.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.513
You mean when you
slammed into him

14:40.547 --> 14:43.216
when you were pouring coffee,
like a maniac?

14:43.250 --> 14:45.618
Uh, he honestly called
you guys about that?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.520
I apologized,
like, five times.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.556
But then the old guy with
him told me to "suck it,"

14:49.589 --> 14:50.991
and then they went
and stood outside,

14:51.024 --> 14:52.492
even though it
was raining.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.527
GIBBS:
Maniac barista, Abb.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.297
Maniac Barista didn't have
anything to do with anything.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.933
Corporal Beck was exposed
to the elements

14:59.967 --> 15:01.601
after the coffee shop,
which gave me the idea

15:01.634 --> 15:04.237
to test the outside of the dart
used to poison him.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.073
What was on it?
Um, particles of his skin,

15:06.106 --> 15:08.108
his undershirt, his uniform,

15:08.141 --> 15:09.609
and a tiny amount
of water residue,

15:09.642 --> 15:11.578
with the exact same
pollutants as the rainstorm

15:11.611 --> 15:13.513
we had this morning.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.249
So the dart must've passed
through a drop on his jacket.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.484
You got a timeline?

15:17.517 --> 15:20.087
Well, the rainstorm
happened post-coffee,

15:20.120 --> 15:24.324
which means the dart had to be
injected sometime after that.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.159
McGEE:
Got something.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.328
I've been looking
through the places

15:28.361 --> 15:29.997
that Corporal Beck
volunteered at.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.598
Yesterday, the Metro Ties
Crisis Center

15:31.631 --> 15:33.466
reported a security breech.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.335
What kind?
The center
hosts a hotline,

15:35.368 --> 15:36.736
all incoming calls are recorded.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.005
The system was hacked.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.306
The recordings were copied?

15:39.339 --> 15:41.608
No, they were erased,
and only the ones

15:41.641 --> 15:43.476
from the last night that
Corporal Beck worked there.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.677
What are we looking at here?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.646
Well, most people
that call the hotline

15:46.679 --> 15:48.982
are in need of help with
overwhelming situations.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.351
They could be suicidal
or feel threatened.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.986
If someone
told Beck something...

15:53.020 --> 15:54.687
He could've been killed
because he knew too much.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.733
Hey.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.501
Hey, found something.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.370
Mm, you know who
poisoned Corporal Beck?

16:10.403 --> 16:13.040
Nope, Operation
Sweaty Maverick.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.108
I scoured the Internet
for cell phone video posts

16:15.142 --> 16:17.277
of the karaoke competition
and struck gold.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.212
Look at this.

16:22.449 --> 16:26.653
* And they called it
puppy love... *

16:26.686 --> 16:29.256
This is the song
that got Quinn going?

16:29.289 --> 16:30.757
* Oh, I guess...

16:30.790 --> 16:32.559
McGEE:
Got to admit, he was committed.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.760
BISHOP:
Wait...

16:35.295 --> 16:36.696
Is that the back
of Quinn's head?

16:36.729 --> 16:37.764
Let me zoom in.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.433
BISHOP:
Enhance that, Tim.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.402
I can't, it's a, it's a
tiny file, it'll pixilate.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.204
But that's got
to be her, right?

16:44.237 --> 16:47.207
BISHOP: Yeah, this could be the
moment that she fell for him.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.342
But it's all
circumstantial.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.144
I don't know,
I think it's enough.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.779
No.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.681
No, if we want to know for sure,

16:54.714 --> 16:57.750
we are gonna have to get
it from the horse's mouth.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.819
I think I can get Quinn to talk.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.188
You willing to go there?

17:01.221 --> 17:02.822
Okay.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.823
I'll talk to Torres.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.525
I'll get him alone, man to man.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.060
Fantasize on your own time,
McGee.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.062
No, boss, I wasn't talking
about me, I...

17:09.096 --> 17:09.762
Give me an update, let's go.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.798
Hmm.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.166
Okay.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.734
Metro Ties Crisis Center.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.369
Corporal Beck has been

17:16.403 --> 17:17.704
volunteering there
for over a year.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.706
The last time he worked there
was two nights ago.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.841
BISHOP: There were 17 calls
to the hotline that night,

17:21.874 --> 17:24.344
but there's no telling which one
of those callers Beck spoke to.

17:24.377 --> 17:28.181
Or why the calls were
remotely erased the next day.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.850
We do know that
the remote hack originated

17:30.883 --> 17:33.386
from a cable company's tech
support center in Florida.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.388
Problem is, there's over
30 tech specialists there,

17:35.422 --> 17:36.823
so it's impossible to pinpoint

17:36.856 --> 17:38.691
who exactly did the hacking.
(phone rings)

17:38.725 --> 17:41.161
Well, go to the crisis center,
Bishop, figure it out.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.429
Gibbs, can I take Quinn?

17:42.462 --> 17:45.332
Yeah, go.
Yeah. Gibbs.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.600
Hello, Reeves.

17:47.634 --> 17:51.171
Mm-hmm, what kind of problem?

17:53.773 --> 17:54.841
(door closes)

17:58.145 --> 17:58.811
You cuffed him?

17:58.845 --> 18:00.347
He tried to escape four times

18:00.380 --> 18:01.748
in the last hour.

18:01.781 --> 18:02.782
I'd have had it
that last time.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.251
The only way he caught me

18:04.284 --> 18:05.452
was he shoved a small child
in my way.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.686
REEVES:
That's an exaggeration.

18:06.719 --> 18:07.754
Gibbs, he doesn't care

18:07.787 --> 18:09.356
about seeing any memorial.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.590
HENRY:
Open your ears.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.458
That is not what I said.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.860
Take 'em off.
He told me to cuff him.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.895
Said it's the only way I'd keep
him in this "table room."

18:15.928 --> 18:18.798
In other news, leprechauns
don't read sarcasm.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.203
Gibbs, I hate to say it,

18:23.236 --> 18:25.605
but I don't think I'm the
right man for this detail.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.707
HENRY:
I'd rather sit here
with you, Marine.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.109
As far as I can tell, at least
you'd keep your mouth shut.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.346
I asked him for a list
of all the people

18:33.380 --> 18:35.315
who got close to the corporal
this morning.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.616
"The tour guide,

18:36.649 --> 18:38.518
the fossils on the tour,
the crowd at the airport,

18:38.551 --> 18:40.887
and the crowd at the monument."
He's not going to be any help.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.389
That's the first smart thing
he's said.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.557
Quit your whining.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.459
Both of you.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.161
Work it out.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.397
Gibbs, wait.
Case is still wide open.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.598
You got him for the night.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.501
What, all night?
(door closes)

18:58.771 --> 19:01.241
I am not giving up
on my room service.

19:01.274 --> 19:04.544
You're calling
for a cot, Lucky Charms.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.879
All right, I know there's no
recovering the recordings,

19:06.913 --> 19:08.581
but did it seem like this

19:08.615 --> 19:11.884
Benjamin guy had more
information about the hack?

19:11.918 --> 19:14.821
What are you doing?
Nothing.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.424
What are you looking at
the back of my head for?
No, I'm not, I'm not.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.426
I'm just thinking about, um,

19:19.459 --> 19:21.294
puppies... you know that song
about puppies?

19:21.328 --> 19:22.595
No.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.797
What is going on
with you and McGee?

19:24.831 --> 19:28.268
You've been weirder
than usual.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.903
We heard a rumor that at FLETC

19:30.937 --> 19:33.973
you had relations with Torres.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.676
Really?

19:36.709 --> 19:38.978
Me and Torr...

19:39.011 --> 19:40.913
That's hilarious.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.982
So, it's not true?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.485
Bishop, if I had spent
any amount of time

19:45.518 --> 19:49.222
underneath that man, I'd be
crushed to death by his ego.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.290
MAN:
Agent Bishop?

19:50.323 --> 19:51.924
Yes.
Benjamin Harmey.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.460
Hi. This is
Special Agent Quinn.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.794
I won't waste your
time with questions,

19:54.827 --> 19:55.962
I know how busy you must be.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.764
Corporal Beck was
highly valued here.

19:57.797 --> 19:58.898
He'll be missed.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.968
Seems to be the case
everywhere he went.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.370
The information
you asked for...

20:03.403 --> 20:05.672
I checked the caller I.D.
on the phone

20:05.705 --> 20:07.674
Corporal Beck was stationed at
his last night here.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.376
How many calls did he take?
Three.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.011
I ran the incoming phone numbers
through our cataloging system.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.713
Two of them
were frequent callers.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.383
Meaning what?
One of them is a man who calls

20:16.416 --> 20:18.685
the hotline every time he loses
his TV remote.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.320
The call lasted less
than a minute.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.955
The other was a legitimate case.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.291
An alcoholic who reaches out

20:24.324 --> 20:25.625
when she's on the verge
of relapse.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.493
Uh, and the third?

20:26.526 --> 20:27.594
It was logged
as a first-time caller,

20:27.627 --> 20:29.929
but it came through
as "Private." No phone number.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.632
Not much else I can tell you,

20:32.665 --> 20:33.800
except that
the conversation lasted

20:33.833 --> 20:35.302
a significant amount of time.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.736
48 minutes.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.411
You're breaking the fire code.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.945
I'm not exactly
going to give you

20:45.978 --> 20:47.980
a direct line to the door,
Henry.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.983
Sons of bitches

20:51.017 --> 20:52.919
didn't even use fresh potatoes.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.455
You think I can't
tell the difference?

20:55.488 --> 20:56.823
I was foreman
of a food-packing plant

20:56.856 --> 20:57.924
for 30 years.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.026
When you were in the shower,

21:00.059 --> 21:02.028
I took a look at your file.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.930
You were awarded the Navy Cross.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.498
Yeah. What about it?

21:05.532 --> 21:08.000
You ran
straight into enemy fire,

21:08.034 --> 21:10.036
pulled the rest
of your recon team to safety.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.972
Two of them died anyway.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.441
The other one
was killed in action

21:14.474 --> 21:16.275
a month later
in a mortar attack.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.079
What happened this morning...

21:20.112 --> 21:23.783
When he went down--
the corporal...

21:26.018 --> 21:27.387
He was just a kid.

21:30.490 --> 21:35.094
We were all just kids.

21:35.127 --> 21:39.799
Listen... Honor Flight
said vets' family and friends

21:39.832 --> 21:42.001
usually have a welcome home
when you get to the airport.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.704
Who do we call to reschedule?

21:44.737 --> 21:45.972
No one.
Well, you'll be getting back

21:46.005 --> 21:47.340
later than you thought,

21:47.374 --> 21:48.908
so whoever's planning
your welcome home

21:48.941 --> 21:50.076
will have to reshuffle.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.044
I didn't have a welcome home
when I got back from 'Nam.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.880
What good would it do me
to have one now?

21:56.483 --> 21:59.051
Nobody was planning one
at all, then?

21:59.085 --> 22:00.687
Don't you do that. Don't.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.355
What?
You want to feel sorry
for someone,

22:02.389 --> 22:03.756
look in the mirror.

22:03.790 --> 22:07.394
Sad little orphan,
bumbling around.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.429
I'm not sad.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.730
You sure as hell
didn't call anyone

22:10.763 --> 22:13.032
to tell them you're bunking here
tonight. Did you?

22:13.065 --> 22:16.436
You're feeling sorry for me
for being alone?

22:16.469 --> 22:19.739
I'm right where I want to be,
kid.

22:19.772 --> 22:22.875
(clinking)

22:22.909 --> 22:25.445
This is my sweet spot.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.647
Thought you wanted
to eat in peace.
I do.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.449
Fact, I'll buy you one,
if it'll keep you quiet.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.117
No, thanks.
You're too good for whiskey?

22:31.150 --> 22:32.785
I don't drink.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.120
Got that bad, huh?

22:42.862 --> 22:44.597
Abbs.

22:44.631 --> 22:45.798
What are you doing?

22:45.832 --> 22:47.467
Well, I met Henry yesterday

22:47.500 --> 22:50.570
when Reeves had him handcuffed
in the conference room,

22:50.603 --> 22:53.640
and he just filled my heart
with so much joy.
TORRES: Henry?

22:53.673 --> 22:56.175
The handful?
Handful of joy.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.411
Yeah. So I'm making
him a welcome mat.

22:58.445 --> 22:59.746
With studs.
Yeah.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.481
I mean, can you imagine

23:01.514 --> 23:02.849
how awful it must have been

23:02.882 --> 23:05.184
for him to come home
from fighting in Vietnam

23:05.217 --> 23:07.487
and have people spit

23:07.520 --> 23:09.422
on his uniform?
Yeah.

23:09.456 --> 23:11.491
Of course you can, Gibbs.
You saw friends

23:11.524 --> 23:13.059
just a few years older than you

23:13.092 --> 23:15.061
come home to that.
Or not come home at all.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.930
I can't change
Henry's experience,

23:17.964 --> 23:20.066
but I can make him feel welcome

23:20.099 --> 23:21.901
every time he steps
through his door.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.704
And I've decided to volunteer
as a guardian

23:24.737 --> 23:26.205
for the Honor Flight Network.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.440
Proud of you, Abbs.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.741
And I appreciate that support.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.510
And we have a case to solve.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.579
Yeah, go.

23:32.612 --> 23:36.949
So, I looked into
mystery caller number three

23:36.983 --> 23:39.018
that Corporal Beck spoke to

23:39.051 --> 23:40.086
the last night
he worked the hotline.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.622
Center got hacked,
call got erased.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.057
Yeah, so I can't tell
you what was said,

23:45.091 --> 23:47.727
but after some
stellar teleforensics

23:47.760 --> 23:49.228
with the phone company,

23:49.261 --> 23:52.632
I can tell you that the private
call came from a landline

23:52.665 --> 23:54.467
belonging to...

23:54.501 --> 23:55.234
Maya Davis.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.669
Love it, Abbs.
Me, too.

23:56.703 --> 23:59.105
Send us the address.
Yep.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.941
License plate is
registered to Maya Davis.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.643
That's her plate,
she's here.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.846
Torres.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.992
TORRES:
She wrote something there.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.162
GIBBS:
"Form."

24:24.196 --> 24:25.898
What does it mean?

24:35.307 --> 24:37.777
Same kind of dart as the
one used in Corporal Beck?

24:37.810 --> 24:39.211
Yes, the injection
site was here.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.917
And Abby confirmed
that the botulinum cocktail

24:44.951 --> 24:47.086
was once again
the means to the end.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.889
Time of death?
Approximately 8:00
this morning,

24:49.922 --> 24:51.591
which puts
the injection

24:51.624 --> 24:54.093
some time in the
two hours prior.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.664
Ah, there it is,

24:57.697 --> 25:01.568
the classic Jethro look
of query and frustration,

25:01.601 --> 25:05.705
mixed with a dash of
"Someone is gonna pay for this."

25:05.738 --> 25:08.708
Two victims, same M.O.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.877
The only connection is
she calls the hotline

25:10.910 --> 25:12.612
and the corporal picks up.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.947
Precisely,
which begs the question,

25:14.981 --> 25:16.716
what was that call about?

25:16.749 --> 25:17.917
Precisely.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.087
Did you hear that?

25:21.120 --> 25:24.857
He used a three-syllable adverb.

25:24.891 --> 25:28.661
I daresay my years here
have made an impact.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.663
BISHOP: Maya Davis,
33 years old,

25:30.697 --> 25:33.866
worked in product development at
a flooring company, lived alone.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.902
McGee and Torres are
searching her apartment.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.737
BISHOP: But so far, they haven't
found anything that tells us

25:37.770 --> 25:38.905
why she made a call
to the crisis center.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.740
QUINN:
Or what kind of form she meant

25:40.773 --> 25:42.041
when she wrote it on that paper.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.342
Abby also processed her car,

25:43.375 --> 25:44.711
but it came out clean.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.178
Someone had to know something.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.947
QUINN:
Maya had two brothers.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.215
The only problem they said was

25:49.248 --> 25:51.818
with her overactive
ex-boyfriend.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.587
Maya filed a restraining
order against him last year.

25:54.621 --> 25:55.888
Report said that

25:55.922 --> 25:57.323
he smashed her car windows,

25:57.356 --> 25:58.557
that's when she got
an unlisted number,

25:58.591 --> 26:01.127
but he's been living in New
Zealand for the last six months.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.729
Could've hired someone else
to do his dirty work.

26:02.762 --> 26:05.331
Still no telling how that would
connect to the call.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.999
Find out.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.869
Uh, actually, Gibbs,
one more thing:

26:09.902 --> 26:11.738
Maya's normal schedule
suggests that

26:11.771 --> 26:13.773
she was on her way to
work when she died,

26:13.806 --> 26:15.608
but during the time frame
of her poisoning,

26:15.642 --> 26:17.343
her cell pinged off a
tower near her apartment.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.011
The dart was injected at home?

26:19.045 --> 26:20.146
That's what I'm thinking.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.714
Loop in McGee and Torres.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.883
If it happened at her place,
find proof.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.285
(types)

26:27.654 --> 26:29.088
Ooh.
Ooh, pardon me,

26:29.121 --> 26:31.323
Director.
Officer Reeves, I've
been looking for you.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.025
I've got something in the works.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.695
Compartmented mission,
details forthcoming.

26:35.728 --> 26:36.996
Extremely high-risk.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.230
Are you interested?

26:38.264 --> 26:40.199
100%, sir, absolutely.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.868
And your current detail.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.335
A little birdie told me
that you resorted

26:43.369 --> 26:45.738
to handcuffing a senior citizen
to a chair.

26:45.772 --> 26:46.973
That was a minor blip, really.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.775
We had a fine night,

26:48.808 --> 26:50.810
and now we're back here
ready to help when called upon.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.745
And in the meantime,
a scavenger hunt.

26:52.779 --> 26:56.115
Oh, no, uh, Henry asked for
a heating pad for his back.
Ah.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.350
Luckily, Abby has everything
in that lab of hers,

26:58.384 --> 27:00.653
and she also made him
this welcome mat.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.188
Mm, like the studs.

27:02.221 --> 27:03.923
I'll be in touch
with your new orders.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.191
Thank you, sir.

27:08.895 --> 27:11.197
No, no, no, no, no.

27:12.398 --> 27:13.866
No.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.104
Bloody hell!

27:18.137 --> 27:20.139
Well, I found some papers,
but nothing that flags

27:20.172 --> 27:21.808
as the form she
was talking about.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.143
And nothing that indicates
the dart was injected

27:24.176 --> 27:25.411
while she was here.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.916
Maya-- I always
liked that name.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.751
You know, when I was undercover
in Wisconsin,

27:31.784 --> 27:33.285
I had a contact named Maya.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.888
She could kill you with
a nailclipper and a corncob.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.156
(soft chuckle)

27:37.189 --> 27:38.390
Hey, uh,

27:38.424 --> 27:40.927
speaking of women
with names,

27:40.960 --> 27:43.395
you and, uh, Quinn
ever have a thing?

27:43.429 --> 27:45.431
What?
Well, you know,
it's just Bishop, uh,

27:45.464 --> 27:47.266
shared this
crazy rumor

27:47.299 --> 27:49.035
and she keeps bugging me
about it, you know what I mean.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.903
Wait, you think that
Quinn and I had a thing?

27:50.937 --> 27:51.904
I don't know.

27:51.938 --> 27:52.939
Did you?

27:52.972 --> 27:54.040
No.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.808
Well, I never tried, but,

27:55.842 --> 27:57.977
but if it's believable,
I wouldn't mind that rumor,

27:58.010 --> 28:00.246
(whistles)
you know, making its way around.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.281
It feeds the rep, you
know what I'm saying?

28:02.314 --> 28:04.383
Right.
(soft chuckle)

28:04.416 --> 28:07.954
But, I mean, as far as-as
you and Quinn, you, uh...

28:07.987 --> 28:10.857
never sang into a microphone
while she watched?

28:10.890 --> 28:13.860
Look at this, it says
it's allergy medicine.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.963
It doesn't look like that,
looks more like pencil shavings.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.230
Yeah, but why
would anybody put

28:18.264 --> 28:20.833
pencil shavings inside
of a pill bottle?

28:20.867 --> 28:22.468
Or why would anyone
keep them at all?

28:22.501 --> 28:24.436
(knocking)

28:24.470 --> 28:25.972
So it's true?

28:26.005 --> 28:27.506
You found Maya out here?

28:27.539 --> 28:30.509
What'd you do? Haul her car away
to the station already?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.011
Who are you?

28:32.044 --> 28:33.980
Dale Gruber,
building manager.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.816
I came back as soon as
I heard what happened.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.785
I was out of town at a
snake owner's convention.

28:38.818 --> 28:39.986
Well, that makes sense.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.988
McGEE: We didn't see any
security cameras here.

28:42.021 --> 28:43.856
Is there any way of knowing
who was in the apartment

28:43.890 --> 28:45.191
between 6:00 and
8:00 this morning?

28:45.224 --> 28:47.927
No, but then again I doubt
if even Maya herself

28:47.960 --> 28:49.762
would've been home for
a good chunk of that time.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.263
Why not?
She used to go out,

28:51.297 --> 28:53.766
every morning, took a long walk
right before work.

28:53.800 --> 28:54.934
If she's still in the
neighborhood, her cell should

28:54.967 --> 28:56.969
ping off the tower nearby.

28:57.003 --> 28:58.805
Hey, if you guys see any sign
of a boa constrictor in there,

28:58.838 --> 29:00.006
could you
let me know?

29:00.039 --> 29:03.009
I haven't seen Bonnie
since... Friday.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.945
We'll put out
a BOLO.

29:05.978 --> 29:09.215
* I've known men
who have had love *

29:09.248 --> 29:11.050
(knocking)

29:11.083 --> 29:12.084
* But threw it...

29:12.118 --> 29:13.920
Gibbs, tell me
you've got him.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.955
Where is he?

29:15.988 --> 29:17.123
Hello, Reeves.

29:17.156 --> 29:19.058
I'm guessing
you lost Henry.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.093
He laid a trap and then
he picked the cuffs.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.129
I've been looking for him
for the last two hours.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.897
I was driving nearby and
I thought maybe he'd be here,

29:24.931 --> 29:26.999
and you two were just taking
the Mick out of me,

29:27.033 --> 29:30.002
you know, 'cause you're both
Marines and I'm a Brit?

29:30.036 --> 29:32.204
The whole
American Revolution thing?

29:32.238 --> 29:33.372
He's not here.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.074
Right.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.976
Damn.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.145
You've got good instincts,
Reeves.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.480
Need to use them.

29:41.513 --> 29:44.050
What do you mean?

29:44.083 --> 29:47.820
You were with this
guy for two days,

29:47.854 --> 29:50.322
and you don't know
where he is.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.091
What, and you do?

29:52.124 --> 29:54.994
* In my world.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.071
(breathing heavily)

30:05.104 --> 30:07.039
(sniffles)

30:28.494 --> 30:30.496
(exhales sharply)

30:37.069 --> 30:39.071
(sighs)

30:42.141 --> 30:44.143
(cries)

30:48.114 --> 30:50.549
He told me he didn't care
about seeing the memorial.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.186
He also told you
to open your ears,

30:54.220 --> 30:55.955
that's not what he said.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.624
Coming here was the only
thing he did care about.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.459
He just wanted
to do it alone.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.028
Well, then he should've
just said that

31:02.061 --> 31:03.629
instead of annoying the hell
out of me.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.264
(chuckles)
Well, it can get annoying,

31:05.297 --> 31:06.632
looking in the mirror.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.603
You.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.605
Just begging for another
high-risk mission.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.574
Another way to just
push people away,

31:15.607 --> 31:17.176
like you've done
your whole life.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.478
What do you know about it?
A lot.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.948
Listen...

31:21.981 --> 31:25.151
I heard about
your family, Gibbs.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.553
And I am sorry
for what happened to them,

31:27.586 --> 31:29.455
but that doesn't make you
an expert on me.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.257
I didn't say it did.
You got your memories.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.292
I was three years old
when my parents died.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.061
I haven't got a clue
how it feels

31:35.094 --> 31:36.395
to have somebody care about me.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.396
I'm not saying you do.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.966
This is how I am.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.068
Because this is all I ever was.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.943
I've got more than memories.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.047
Got the people
I let in afterwards.

31:55.081 --> 31:58.550
I got the family
I chose to make.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.558
You, me, Henry--

32:06.592 --> 32:08.594
all the same guys.

32:08.627 --> 32:11.130
You're just
a few decades behind.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.103
Man, you lose everything,
you make a choice:

32:17.136 --> 32:19.105
where to go from there.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.107
He made his choice.
I made mine.

32:27.379 --> 32:29.381
What about you?

32:35.154 --> 32:37.123
(car door closes)

32:37.156 --> 32:39.158
(sighs)

32:48.034 --> 32:49.001
GIBBS:
Abbs?

32:49.035 --> 32:50.469
Henry!
No.

32:50.502 --> 32:51.770
I thought you were
bringing Henry.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.672
He said if he didn't
stop at a vending machine,

32:53.705 --> 32:56.008
he'd punch a wall.
(laughs)

32:56.042 --> 32:58.144
He fills me
with so much joy.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.745
So I've been scrolling
through the traffic

32:59.778 --> 33:01.247
and security cam footage

33:01.280 --> 33:02.781
of Maya Davis' walk
yesterday morning.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.250
Anybody get close enough
to poison her?

33:04.283 --> 33:05.651
Oh, yeah.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.619
She's, like,
the neighborhood mayor.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.621
And she's a hugger, too,
which I totally get.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.091
So, I found four people
that she stopped to talk to

33:12.124 --> 33:14.626
and two that definitely passed
close enough to inject her.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.795
I'm running a program now
to enhance the stills.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.064
Abby.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.267
Henry!

33:21.300 --> 33:22.268
(grunts)

33:22.301 --> 33:24.036
Your vending machine sucks.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.738
I'm sorry. You know,
I could make you some cookies

33:26.772 --> 33:28.540
with my Bunsen burner
if you want.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.176
I could eat cookies.

33:30.209 --> 33:31.510
Okay, I'll get right on that,

33:31.543 --> 33:32.778
'cause these photos
should be enhanced shortly.

33:32.811 --> 33:34.513
REEVES:
We need you to tell us

33:34.546 --> 33:36.048
if you recognize
any of these people

33:36.082 --> 33:38.117
from your time
with Corporal Beck.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.818
You gonna hold my hand while
I look? I know what you need.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.121
I'm here for the
kid, all right?
GIBBS: Abbs,

33:42.154 --> 33:42.754
this thing is blinking.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.290
Oh, my God,

33:44.323 --> 33:45.457
I forgot I put
him on mute

33:45.491 --> 33:47.025
for being naughty.

33:47.759 --> 33:48.694
Long story.

33:48.727 --> 33:49.795
GIBBS:
What's it saying?

33:49.828 --> 33:52.098
ABBY: It's the shavings
from the prescription bottle

33:52.131 --> 33:54.566
at Maya's apartment.
They came from a laminate,

33:54.600 --> 33:57.203
like the kind manufactured
for flooring.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.404
She worked in a flooring place.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.139
Gibbs, this sample contains

34:00.172 --> 34:02.141
a huge amount of formaldehyde.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.776
A floor made from that could
make people really sick.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.212
Form.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.580
Form-aldehyde.
You got to keep up, Gibbs.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.150
Form. She wrote the word "form"
before she died.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.619
She was trying to write
formaldehyde.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.555
HENRY:
Her.

34:16.588 --> 34:17.789
I'd know that dirty thief
anywhere.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.758
She robbed you?
She stole a cab,

34:19.791 --> 34:20.826
right before
the kid went down.

34:20.859 --> 34:21.727
But she wasn't
that close to him.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.562
GIBBS: Could've got to him
before the cab,

34:23.595 --> 34:24.863
any time at the museum.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.798
All right, I am directing
facial recognition

34:26.832 --> 34:29.768
to the DMV database now.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.104
BISHOP:
And we got her.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.772
Bridget O'Leary, 36,

34:33.805 --> 34:36.142
purchasing manager at the
company where Maya worked:

34:36.175 --> 34:37.509
Armitage Flooring.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.378
Based on the environmental
safety report

34:39.411 --> 34:41.113
that O'Leary signed,

34:41.147 --> 34:44.150
the company just imported
$15 million worth of

34:44.183 --> 34:45.217
laminate flooring
from Asia.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.352
The flooring is scheduled

34:46.385 --> 34:47.853
to ship out to customers
in two days.

34:47.886 --> 34:50.222
It's possible the same stuff
that Abby tested,

34:50.256 --> 34:51.857
that's contaminated
with formaldehyde.

34:51.890 --> 34:52.724
Well, according to Maya, it is.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.693
She opened an alternate
e-mail account

34:54.726 --> 34:56.128
to make contact with Peter Kang

34:56.162 --> 34:56.862
at the D.C. Chronicle.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.230
TORRES:
We talked to the guy.

34:58.264 --> 34:59.765
He said Maya
asked to meet with him.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.133
She was gonna
blow the whistle.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.601
Well,
if Maya had blown the whistle,

35:02.634 --> 35:03.702
it could've taken down
the whole company.

35:03.735 --> 35:04.570
QUINN:
Bridget O'Leary

35:04.603 --> 35:06.672
signed that environmental
safety report,

35:06.705 --> 35:08.674
it would have ended her career.
TORRES: O'Leary killed Maya

35:08.707 --> 35:09.741
before she could talk.

35:09.775 --> 35:10.542
Where is she?

35:10.576 --> 35:12.278
McGEE: According to
her phone's GPS,

35:12.311 --> 35:14.880
O'Leary is at work,
Armitage Flooring.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.783
Strap on your boots, people.

35:17.816 --> 35:21.253
McGee, Quinn, you're here.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.454
Show-and-tell, guys.

35:22.488 --> 35:23.722
You got it, boss.

35:26.492 --> 35:27.893
O'LEARY:
Yes, the shipment arrived.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.428
I have 108 units
going wholesale,

35:29.461 --> 35:30.862
and the rest is...

35:30.896 --> 35:32.431
Excuse me, we're looking
for Bridget O'Leary.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.466
Oh, she's right there.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.502
I'll call you back.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.215
TORRES:
You go right, I go left.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.183
Hey, move! Clear the area!
Clear the area.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.918
Okay.

35:52.951 --> 35:55.153
(beeping)

35:59.391 --> 36:01.227
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

36:03.495 --> 36:05.297
All right, I'll
pick it up now.

36:05.331 --> 36:08.434
(forklift beeping)

36:18.844 --> 36:20.312
Help! I'm being chased!

36:22.348 --> 36:24.182
(grunts)

36:25.251 --> 36:26.852
NCIS federal agent!

36:26.885 --> 36:29.255
Okay, okay, okay.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.224
Hey! Freeze!

36:35.994 --> 36:37.296
You ready?

36:37.329 --> 36:38.897
For what?

36:38.930 --> 36:40.999
McGEE:
Show-and-tell.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.302
You and Maya lived
in the same neighborhood,

36:43.335 --> 36:45.504
you worked at the same company,
you were friends.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.473
Is that
against the law?

36:47.506 --> 36:49.275
She confided in you,
she told you

36:49.308 --> 36:50.309
she was gonna blow the whistle.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.610
McGEE:
She also told you

36:51.643 --> 36:53.279
that she called the
hotline for advice,

36:53.312 --> 36:55.414
and that she gave details
to the guy that answered.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.849
And you I.D.'d the guy
as Corporal Beck.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.686
McGEE: That's one of the cabs
you took to follow him.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.953
You can't even see
the passenger.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.622
You paid with your credit card.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.023
McGEE:
You got close enough

37:05.056 --> 37:06.525
to inject Beck at the museum.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.426
Then, you took
the first cab

37:07.459 --> 37:09.295
out of there.
QUINN:
Then you woke up

37:09.328 --> 37:10.161
the next morning,
you went and did

37:10.195 --> 37:13.432
the exact same thing
to your friend Maya.

37:13.465 --> 37:16.234
So, we showed.
This is the part where you tell.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.438
I want a lawyer.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.640
Mm.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.342
VANCE:
Officer Reeves.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.010
The particulars for
your new assignment.

37:25.043 --> 37:28.780
You sign on today,
you leave for Syria next week.

37:28.814 --> 37:31.016
Are you in?

37:31.049 --> 37:33.919
May I have a moment
to think about it?

37:35.921 --> 37:40.359
*

37:40.392 --> 37:42.628
TORRES:
* And they called it

37:42.661 --> 37:45.263
* Puppy love

37:46.832 --> 37:49.034
* Oh, I guess that
(chuckles)

37:49.067 --> 37:51.370
* They'll never know.

37:51.403 --> 37:52.371
(video stops)

37:52.404 --> 37:53.772
So?
So...

37:53.805 --> 37:56.475
how would you think that
that would make me

37:56.508 --> 37:58.076
want to unzip anything?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.345
Hmm.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.748
This isn't you?

38:02.781 --> 38:05.417
No, does it look like
I go to karaoke bars?

38:05.451 --> 38:08.086
Really? I mean, I was so sure.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.055
Those beachy waves.

38:10.088 --> 38:14.360
Oh, please. I mean, my-my hair
was way shorter back then.

38:14.393 --> 38:15.794
All right.

38:15.827 --> 38:19.331
Another NCIS rumor
properly laid to rest.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.866
I tried to tell her
it was ridiculous.

38:21.700 --> 38:22.801
Bishop.
(scoffs)

38:22.834 --> 38:23.802
(mouths)

38:23.835 --> 38:25.771
Um, anyway, we, uh,

38:25.804 --> 38:26.972
found out how
Bridget O'Leary

38:27.005 --> 38:28.039
hacked the
crisis center.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.108
She has a cousin who works
at that cable company

38:30.141 --> 38:30.909
in Florida.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.844
The cousin erased
the recordings,

38:32.878 --> 38:35.681
then called Corporal Beck's
house to fish for his location.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.516
And Tampa police
just took the guy into custody.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.418
QUINN:
Bottom line,

38:39.451 --> 38:42.087
O'Leary killed two people
over some really ugly flooring.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.423
Well,

38:44.456 --> 38:46.592
anyone up for a little
group decompressing?

38:46.625 --> 38:48.927
Well, you lost the
Gibbs tofu-steak bet,

38:48.960 --> 38:50.596
so I think first
round is on you.

38:50.629 --> 38:53.699
Fair is fair. You guys coming?

38:53.732 --> 38:54.733
TORRES:
Hells yes.

38:54.766 --> 38:55.867
QUINN:
Yeah, right behind you.

38:55.901 --> 38:57.536
All right.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.714
Well, that was
a crazy rumor, huh?

39:08.747 --> 39:09.948
Unreal.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.082
You know,
I don't remember

39:11.116 --> 39:12.651
your hair being shorter
back then.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.423
It wasn't.

39:19.425 --> 39:22.794
(Torres humming "Puppy Love")

39:22.828 --> 39:24.396
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Now arriving from Dulles,

39:24.430 --> 39:26.532
Flight 17 at Gate 3.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.467
Okay, I'm home. That's it.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.837
You guys can turn around
and babysit somebody else.

39:33.939 --> 39:36.575
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome home

39:36.608 --> 39:39.878
Lancaster County's own Vietnam
veteran and hometown hero,

39:39.911 --> 39:41.647
Marine Sergeant Henry Rogers.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.949
(cheering)

39:46.017 --> 39:48.019
("Stars and Stripes Forever"
playing)

40:02.834 --> 40:04.069
Thank you.

40:04.102 --> 40:06.104
Thanks.

40:10.008 --> 40:14.513
You did a good thing,
putting this together for him.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.583
Couldn't have done it
without you.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.785
Syria?

40:22.721 --> 40:24.623
I decided to decline.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.558
Good choice.

40:29.495 --> 40:30.829
Thank you.

40:33.499 --> 40:34.700
