00:01.210 --> 00:02.251
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.461 --> 00:04.379
You're being sent
to the ground.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.466
Before the last war,
Mount Weather was

00:08.676 --> 00:10.802
a military base built
within a Mountain.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.388
No one ever made it there.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.764
Welcome
to Mount Weather.

00:14.974 --> 00:16.015
You're not prisoners.

00:16.225 --> 00:17.266
We saved you.

00:17.476 --> 00:18.810
Why would we
want to leave?

00:19.019 --> 00:20.436
We have friends
out there who need our help.

00:20.646 --> 00:22.021
Clarke, no!

00:22.231 --> 00:23.314
If you pull that lever,
these people will die.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.108
Even a little radiation
could kill them.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.234
Are we really
gonna do this,

00:26.443 --> 00:28.528
bring the ark
to the ground?

00:28.737 --> 00:29.696
Tell me what
it's like.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.280
Everything
I dreamed.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.991
Thelonious, you
should be here.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.410
My job is done.
Jaha out.

00:38.622 --> 00:39.872
I thought you died.

00:40.082 --> 00:40.999
You brought me
to your village?

00:41.250 --> 00:42.125
They'll kill you.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.502
You son of a bitch!

00:44.712 --> 00:46.004
Unh!

00:46.213 --> 00:48.756
You are not in control
here anymore.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.288
Open it up.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.581
Yes, sir.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.255
How long are you
gonna keep me

01:29.465 --> 01:31.716
locked up in here?

01:31.925 --> 01:32.967
Until I'm confident
you're no longer

01:33.177 --> 01:34.594
a threat to others.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.181
Let's continue.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.391
Now you said
there were hundreds

01:40.601 --> 01:42.435
of grounders attacking.

01:42.644 --> 01:43.936
200, 300?

01:44.146 --> 01:46.022
I didn't count.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.482
Why do you think
they attacked?

01:47.691 --> 01:48.566
What provoked them?

01:48.776 --> 01:50.985
We were here.
That was enough.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.653
We're wasting time.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.447
The others didn't
just vanish into thin air.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.699
They were taken,
and we need to go after them.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.035
Search team is
prepping to leave

01:59.244 --> 02:01.996
but not before we've
gotten the intel we need from you.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.626
I need to be on
that team, please.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.668
That's out
of the question.

02:07.878 --> 02:08.836
You're not trained.

02:09.046 --> 02:11.380
It's too dangerous.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.342
Those are my people
out there.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.551
They're my people, too.

02:15.761 --> 02:16.719
You want to help them?

02:16.929 --> 02:18.638
Tell me what we're
up against--

02:18.847 --> 02:20.306
grounder tactics,
their numbers,

02:20.516 --> 02:22.725
what kind of weapons
they used.

02:22.935 --> 02:26.771
Arrows and Spears,
axes, swords,

02:26.980 --> 02:29.315
their teeth.

02:29.525 --> 02:31.317
No guns?

02:31.527 --> 02:33.820
You had guns.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.571
The guns we found
at the aid depot

02:35.781 --> 02:37.532
leveled
the playing field,

02:37.741 --> 02:41.035
and maybe, maybe if we'd had
more bullets, we could have--

02:41.245 --> 02:44.080
there were more bullets.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.456
Search team just returned
from the bunker.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.875
They found two more barrels
full of rifles

02:48.085 --> 02:51.504
and a third filled
with bullets.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.047
We should have
looked harder.

02:56.552 --> 03:00.179
Keep walking.

03:00.389 --> 03:01.973
What's he
doing here?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.724
Excuse me, sir.
Dr. Griffin cleared Mr. Murphy

03:03.934 --> 03:05.017
out of medical.

03:10.983 --> 03:13.317
Put him over there,
major Byrne.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.197
On your knees.

03:20.409 --> 03:21.659
Come on.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.370
Well, this should
be fun.

03:26.915 --> 03:27.999
Let's go!

03:32.754 --> 03:33.713
Move, move, move!

03:33.922 --> 03:34.881
Go, go, go!

03:39.303 --> 03:41.304
There! They were
right there!

03:41.513 --> 03:43.347
Did anyone
see anything?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.724
Who was there?
How many?

03:44.933 --> 03:45.975
What did they
look like?

03:46.185 --> 03:47.226
I don't know,
but I'm sure I saw

03:47.436 --> 03:48.186
someone move.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.437
You opened fire?

03:49.646 --> 03:50.897
That could have
been the kids.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.815
Abby! No.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.902
We'll sweep the woods.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.446
In the meantime,
who issued you that weapon?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.031
I did, sir.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.746
From now on,

04:06.955 --> 04:11.209
only members
of the guard get guns.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.169
Unauthorized use
of firearms

04:13.378 --> 04:15.504
will be punishable
as a felony

04:15.714 --> 04:18.925
under the exodus charter.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.259
Is that clear?

04:20.469 --> 04:21.260
Yes, sir.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.678
Yes, sir.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.851
Marcus, search
the damn woods.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.355
Move out! Teams of 3!

04:32.564 --> 04:33.648
Yes, ma'am!

04:33.857 --> 04:35.274
Radio checks
at 5-minute intervals.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.442
Let's go!

04:59.091 --> 05:01.008
It's not bad.

05:01.218 --> 05:04.679
Maybe they'll hang it
on the walls here one day.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.389
Miller!

05:06.598 --> 05:08.766
Look who finally
got released.

05:08.976 --> 05:09.767
Hey.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.852
Miller.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.354
I'm glad you're OK.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.857
Yeah. Only took,
what, 3 surgeries?

05:17.067 --> 05:18.734
I hear you're fitting
right in.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.741
Twice a day.
Don't forget.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.118
You'll be OK
in a few days.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.078
-Here.
-Thanks.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.455
Maya,
top of the morning...

05:31.665 --> 05:34.500
Is a very dumb thing
to say that I saw

05:34.710 --> 05:36.377
in an old move once.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.753
Hey. You going
to breakfast?

05:37.963 --> 05:39.422
Yeah. You want to
go together?

05:39.631 --> 05:41.048
Sure, yeah.
I-I'd love t--

05:45.220 --> 05:47.638
Um, save me
a seat, OK?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.598
Sorry.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.142
Hey. What's
going on?

05:51.351 --> 05:52.977
That signal means
the surface patrol is back

05:53.186 --> 05:55.021
and someone needs
medical attention.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.606
I have to go
to quarantine.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.275
Hey, Clarke.
What are you doing?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.027
Maybe they found
survivors.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.820
If our people are hurt,
we have a right to know.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.613
I'm pretty sure
we shouldn't just go

06:04.823 --> 06:06.449
w-wandering around.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.163
What are we
dealing with?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.290
The other took off
his gloves and mask to treat him.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.833
He's still in Decon,
but he'll need treatment

06:16.043 --> 06:16.959
as soon as he's
processed through.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.044
Who attacked them?

06:18.253 --> 06:20.421
What are they
doing here?

06:20.630 --> 06:22.298
Hey, stop!
It's not safe!

06:22.507 --> 06:23.924
It is for us.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.969
Let's go, Jasper.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.888
Someone's got to keep
her out of trouble.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.932
Clarke, slow down!

06:33.643 --> 06:37.063
Stop pushing so hard.
These people are--

06:37.272 --> 06:39.482
are lying to us.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.150
That's a bullet wound.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.569
Grounders don't
use guns.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.237
Unless the grounders got
the guns from us.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.572
I don't think so.

06:46.782 --> 06:50.117
I think our people
are alive out there.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.036
Get them out of here.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.227
How are you feeling?

08:40.437 --> 08:41.896
Awesome.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.857
She's lying.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.444
I know that face.
Just spit it out, Abby.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.612
The bullet is
still shifting.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.364
That's why you're
in pain.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.993
I was hoping that
it would stabilize by now.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.369
So how about
you take it out?

08:57.579 --> 08:59.747
Raven, we need to
talk about that.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.587
The bullet is pressing
on your spine.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.005
If we leave it in,
you'll live,

09:08.215 --> 09:10.549
but you'll never
walk again.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.762
And take it out?

09:17.182 --> 09:19.725
The surgery
could kill you.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.561
We have no equipment,
we have no anesthesia.

09:22.771 --> 09:23.938
Will I walk again?

09:24.147 --> 09:26.315
Maybe, but you'd be
awake the whole time.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.776
You'd feel
everything.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.152
Sign me up.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.737
Wait. Raven,
you could die.

09:34.407 --> 09:38.410
In zero G I didn't
need my legs.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.204
Down here, I do.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.543
Take it out.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.073
Where's Lincoln?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.449
Drink.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.788
Drink or die.
Your choice.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.418
All of it.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.027
We need to talk.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.779
Sure. Let's talk
over breakfast.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.489
Who shot
that solider?

11:04.956 --> 11:07.708
The patrol that was
looking for your people

11:07.917 --> 11:10.753
was attacked by what
you call grounders.

11:10.962 --> 11:11.795
I fought grounders.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.088
They don't use guns.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.632
I never mentioned guns.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.217
Sergeant Shaw was shot
by an arrow.

11:17.427 --> 11:21.972
That's not true.
I-I saw the wound.

11:22.182 --> 11:26.060
Sometimes, we feel
so strongly about our people

11:26.269 --> 11:29.480
we see things
that aren't there.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.483
I'd like to see
the body.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.984
Of course.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.909
Come with me.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.044
I know the air's
not that great,

11:52.253 --> 11:53.921
but that's all
we got left.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.843
We're in a fine mess
now, aren't we?

12:01.388 --> 12:04.139
But I can't let you die
up here with me.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.600
Yes.

12:06.810 --> 12:10.813
I guess we better find a way
to get you to the ground, huh?

12:11.022 --> 12:12.648
Yeah. You like that idea?

12:15.318 --> 12:17.820
Ooh. OK. OK.

12:18.029 --> 12:22.032
Come on. OK now, OK.

12:24.119 --> 12:27.121
Let's see what we have
left up here that can save us.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.424
We're almost ready.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.557
Do you want me to talk

12:46.766 --> 12:48.183
or just shut up?

13:05.702 --> 13:07.536
Stop!

13:12.542 --> 13:15.169
I'm so scared.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.755
Look at me.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.506
OK? Just keep
looking at me.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.143
She's ready.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.536
Aah!

14:00.715 --> 14:03.300
Yeah. That was me
at the grounder camp.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.136
You now, I did everything
I could not scream, but eventually--

14:06.346 --> 14:07.971
but eventually,
you broke

14:08.181 --> 14:10.933
and you told them
everything.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.101
And you wouldn't have
because you're better than me.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.395
Damn right.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.606
I'm not a traitor.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.942
I didn't tell them where
they could find us.

14:20.151 --> 14:23.237
And I did.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.447
Yeah, I did.

14:25.657 --> 14:29.409
After they tortured me
in their prison camp for 3 days,

14:29.619 --> 14:30.452
but go ahead.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.870
You just keep believing,

14:32.080 --> 14:36.583
even if you are in here
just like me.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.176
All right.
Bring it in.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.809
Now what?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.394
It's coming
from the north.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.728
On me.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.669
Campbell's alive.
Cut him down.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.296
Let's go!

15:32.181 --> 15:33.891
Sorry to keep you waiting.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.768
We had to finish
decontamination.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.396
Thank you, Dr. Tsing.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.772
The man
with the burns,

15:40.982 --> 15:42.441
how is he?

15:42.650 --> 15:43.692
He's improving.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.987
I-I'd like to
talk to him.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.198
Sir, only patients are
allowed in medical.

15:50.408 --> 15:51.867
We can arrange that.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.082
What is this?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.919
It's a dialysis
shunt.

16:02.128 --> 16:05.714
We all have them
in case of exposure.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.008
Would you like to see
the exit wound?

16:12.555 --> 16:14.932
Sergeant Langston was forced
to push the arrow out

16:15.141 --> 16:16.558
in the field.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.731
Thank you, sir.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.858
We've got it
right here.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.169
We may be out of luck,
little man.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.301
Where'd you get that?

16:55.598 --> 16:57.891
Maybe I'll teach you
to play someday.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.616
Ship-to-ground.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.743
I can't be that crazy.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.463
You see that white door?

17:28.673 --> 17:30.340
It's called an airlock.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.592
Our ride is
on the other side.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.095
It's a missile.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.888
Ironic, huh?

17:37.098 --> 17:39.808
Our ancestors used them
to destroy the world.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.436
We're gonna use one
to get back to it.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.938
That's the good news.

17:45.148 --> 17:49.484
The bad news is...

17:49.694 --> 17:51.987
We can't get to it
unless we go outside.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.232
How is she?

18:29.442 --> 18:31.359
Well, she survived
the surgery.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.987
Don't ask me how.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.531
She's a courageous kid.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.911
That's one thing
these kids have

18:41.120 --> 18:44.247
is courage.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.667
Bellamy can't wait
to get back out there.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.879
Well, he wants to
help his friends.

18:51.089 --> 18:53.799
We all want to find
out what happened to them, Abby,

18:54.008 --> 18:55.884
but not without a plan

18:56.094 --> 18:58.637
or a clear idea of what
we're up against.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.768
You didn't send that
search team out, did you?

19:07.396 --> 19:11.483
Those men
were crucified.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.528
That's a warning
I intend to take very seriously.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.029
We'll search high and low
for the missing kids,

19:16.239 --> 19:17.781
you have my word,

19:17.990 --> 19:19.866
but not before we've
secured this camp.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.327
They tortured
John Murphy.

19:22.537 --> 19:26.456
They put a spear into
Jasper Jordan's chest.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.375
We can't wait.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.710
Marcus...

19:30.920 --> 19:33.130
Please.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.383
I'm sorry.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.343
I've made my decision.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.202
You're feeling
better.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.788
Who are you?

20:06.998 --> 20:10.208
Where's Lincoln?

20:10.418 --> 20:12.586
I'm Nyko.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.255
Lincoln is my friend.
That's why I helped you.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.969
You stand. Good.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.721
Because now you
should run.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.269
Where's Lincoln?

20:29.478 --> 20:31.855
He's answering
for what he's done.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.860
Because he helped you,
our clan is vulnerable.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.696
If the reapers come,
we can't even fight them off.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.698
Wait, wait.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.700
Are you saying that
they caught him?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.997
No, no. Wait.
They'll kill him.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.333
We have to do something.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.876
Please. You said
he's your friend.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.587
We have to do something.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.464
I did do something.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.841
I saved your life.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.343
Now run.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.889
Unh!

21:11.103 --> 21:12.771
Thank you
for saving my life.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.110
Augh!

21:30.790 --> 21:33.500
Al laik Okteivia
kom skai kru,

21:33.751 --> 21:36.211
and you have
something I want.

21:45.471 --> 21:48.265
Al laik indra
kom trigeda.

21:48.474 --> 21:49.975
Chit yu gaf?

21:58.734 --> 22:02.821
I said what do you want,
Octavia of the sky people?

22:03.030 --> 22:04.698
Lincoln.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.825
No.

22:07.034 --> 22:07.993
Agh!

22:13.040 --> 22:15.583
Enough. Nyko is
our only healer.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.670
Good. Then you'll do
as I say.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.588
Agh!

22:20.798 --> 22:23.133
Bring Lincoln to the place
I saw him last.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.801
He knows where that is.

22:25.011 --> 22:28.638
Just you and him,
no one else.

22:28.848 --> 22:32.100
If I see anyone else,

22:32.310 --> 22:35.145
I'll kill your healer.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.980
You have until dark.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.066
Get up.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.828
You felt that?

22:52.038 --> 22:53.830
Yes, I felt that.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.333
Good. Now the left.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.009
Anything?

23:08.888 --> 23:10.096
Try it again.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.600
Try it again!

23:15.978 --> 23:18.646
Finn.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.607
Raven, I want
you to tell me

23:20.816 --> 23:22.942
when you feel
something, OK?

23:33.496 --> 23:34.704
There.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.170
Raven, it appears
that you have

23:42.380 --> 23:43.588
significant damage
to the nerves

23:43.798 --> 23:45.673
in your left leg.

23:45.883 --> 23:46.966
Will it get better?

23:47.176 --> 23:49.636
For now, you'll
need crutches,

23:49.845 --> 23:51.721
but you're alive,

23:51.931 --> 23:54.057
and you're not
in pain anymore.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.309
But I'm still crippled.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.358
I'm gonna give you two
some time.

24:19.750 --> 24:23.294
We always talk
about you.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.422
Don't you want to hear
about my day?

24:30.177 --> 24:33.221
I'm so tired.

24:33.431 --> 24:34.764
Get some rest.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.103
Hey.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.606
When I wake up,

24:43.816 --> 24:45.024
don't be here.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.609
What are you
talking about?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.778
You were here for me

24:48.988 --> 24:50.613
like always,

24:50.823 --> 24:54.784
and our friends
are out there,

24:54.994 --> 24:56.995
and you need to
go get them.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.173
What did
president Wallace say?

25:08.382 --> 25:10.216
He showed me
Shaw's body.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.972
It looked like
an arrow wound.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.891
Well, maybe because
it is an arrow wound.

25:18.100 --> 25:21.311
Or that's what they
want us to think.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.897
What? They could
have doctored it.

25:24.106 --> 25:27.358
Clarke, you sound like
a crazy person.

25:27.568 --> 25:28.985
Why do you want to
screw this up for us?

25:29.195 --> 25:30.862
I don't know
what this is.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.781
This is...Safe.

25:33.991 --> 25:36.493
This is food,
a real bed, clothes,

25:36.702 --> 25:38.077
and my personal favorite--

25:38.287 --> 25:41.414
not getting speared
by grounders.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.124
How long do you think
they'll let us stay here

25:43.334 --> 25:44.918
if you keep this up?

25:48.172 --> 25:50.256
Did someone
threaten you?

25:50.466 --> 25:52.634
Heh. No. No.

25:52.843 --> 25:55.094
It's common sense.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.931
Look. We're guests here,
not prisoners.

25:58.140 --> 26:01.559
What would you do with a guest
who kept calling you a liar

26:01.769 --> 26:03.811
and generally acted like
an ungrateful ass?

26:04.021 --> 26:07.649
Kick the ungrateful
ass out.

26:07.858 --> 26:12.695
Right now, biggest threat
to us is you.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.750
Missile bay
airlock open.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.086
Chancellor code accepted.

26:28.295 --> 26:31.256
Automated missile launch
sequence commencing.

26:41.892 --> 26:45.728
Missile launch
in t-minus 15 minutes.

26:45.938 --> 26:46.896
Yes.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.356
Override lockout.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.608
Don't want to miss
our ride, little man.

26:50.818 --> 26:52.026
Yes.

27:10.754 --> 27:14.716
Don't worry.
This o2 feeds the whole suit.

27:29.607 --> 27:30.523
I know how you feel.

27:36.739 --> 27:40.325
Missile launch in
t-minus 7 minutes and counting.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.463
7 minutes

27:53.672 --> 27:55.965
to fly across the ring,
stick the landing,

27:56.175 --> 27:58.468
and climb into a missile
before it launches.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.388
No problem.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.190
Hold on, little man.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.351
Unh!

29:06.995 --> 29:11.791
Little man, let's never
do that again.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.215
No.

29:21.343 --> 29:25.430
Missile launch in
t-minus 4 minutes and counting.

29:25.639 --> 29:28.141
No.

29:28.350 --> 29:32.979
No. Huh? No!

29:39.445 --> 29:40.862
Dad.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.459
My son.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.552
Son.

30:07.014 --> 30:10.183
It's oxygen deprivation.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.309
Stand up.

30:11.518 --> 30:12.560
No.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.103
You're not done yet.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.813
I am done.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.482
I am!

30:25.240 --> 30:27.784
Our people still
need you.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.787
No. No.

30:30.996 --> 30:36.209
I got them
to the ground.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.252
I did my job.

30:39.922 --> 30:41.214
What would you
tell me to do?

30:41.423 --> 30:44.050
That's not fair.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.303
You would tell me
to live.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.598
You've sacrificed
so much.

30:50.808 --> 30:51.808
Your life can be more

30:52.017 --> 30:54.352
than just
impossible decisions

30:54.561 --> 30:57.647
and a tragic end.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.816
You can choose to live.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.236
I miss you, son.

31:06.448 --> 31:09.408
Every day.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.369
I'm always
with you, dad.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.415
You can do this.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.502
Missile launch
in t-minus two minutes

31:19.711 --> 31:21.045
and counting.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.926
Disarm the warhead.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.554
Check the missile's
parachute.

31:29.763 --> 31:32.181
Confirm the hard seal.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.559
Don't forget
your air tank.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.915
Time to go home.

32:06.341 --> 32:07.550
Get up.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.010
We're going
after them.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.642
It's about time.

32:16.852 --> 32:19.145
Wait, wait.
What about me?

32:24.443 --> 32:26.777
Wait. No!
What are you doing?

32:29.990 --> 32:31.324
He's coming with us.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.617
No way.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.118
He's been to
the grounder prison camp.

32:34.328 --> 32:36.913
He's right. OK.
I can bring you there.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.623
Hey. Sterling
just signaled.

32:38.832 --> 32:40.124
Someone's coming.

32:51.929 --> 32:52.970
First time
I ever played it.

32:53.180 --> 32:56.057
Cool. I loved it.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.743
Langston.

33:15.953 --> 33:16.953
Where you going,
man?

33:17.162 --> 33:18.788
Tonight's
movie night.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.998
I got to pass. Doc says
I got one more treatment.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.375
Ah.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.679
Only patients are
allowed in medical.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.446
Unh.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.834
3, 2, 1,

34:47.044 --> 34:48.169
launch.

35:12.986 --> 35:15.404
Looks like you'll
have to kill me.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.364
Heh.

35:33.715 --> 35:35.091
Lincoln.

35:37.803 --> 35:38.969
He's hurt!

35:39.179 --> 35:40.679
He should be dead.

35:50.524 --> 35:51.816
Sorry.

36:17.551 --> 36:18.509
Reapers!

36:18.718 --> 36:20.052
Hyah!

36:37.988 --> 36:38.946
Lincoln.

36:39.156 --> 36:42.533
Octavia!
Octavia!

36:42.742 --> 36:44.201
Lincoln.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.580
Octavia!

37:21.198 --> 37:22.573
Ha ha!

37:45.472 --> 37:47.306
May we meet again.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.293
You don't
think they saw us?

38:16.503 --> 38:18.629
Shh. Keep it down.

38:30.475 --> 38:31.809
You're late.

38:34.688 --> 38:38.649
Bellamy decided
to bring company.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.110
He's the only person
that's been in their camp.

38:54.541 --> 38:57.084
Here. Find my son.

38:57.294 --> 38:58.669
His name is
Nathan Miller.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.134
Bring them home.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.931
Langston.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.516
Langston.

40:02.275 --> 40:04.276
What are they
doing to you?

41:58.600 --> 41:59.808
Anya?
