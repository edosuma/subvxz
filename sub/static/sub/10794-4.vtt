 intended from the moment
 it entered the star system.

YOUNG: That ship
 is the best chance
 we have of getting home.

00:08.676 --> 00:11.712
Are we done?
 We'll never be done.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.681
WRAY: You shouldn't have
 left him on the planet.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.649
YOUNG: You think
 I don't know that?

00:15.683 --> 00:16.850
CHLOE: Everyone thinks
 we're safe.

00:16.884 --> 00:19.087
They think that
 they'll never find us again.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.854
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

00:24.192 --> 00:26.094
TELFORD: They're coming!
 Who's coming?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.695
Lucian Alliance,
 they're coming
 to take Destiny.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.897
RUSH: There's only one way
 this is going to end
 if we wait.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.200
YOUNG: I'm not surrendering
 this ship.

00:32.232 --> 00:35.103
VARRO:
 I want to know how long you
 plan on keeping us locked up.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.105
What do we have to do
 to earn our freedom?

00:37.138 --> 00:38.672
Prove to me that
 you're not a threat.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.841
ELI: My mom was a nurse.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.676
She got stuck
 by a needle trying to
 restrain a junkie in the ER.

00:42.710 --> 00:43.711
She got HIV.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.746

 you need to do

00:45.779 --> 00:49.850

 (CHLOE GROANING)

00:51.585 --> 00:53.954

 You were shot.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.690
There is no leg wound.
 It's almost completely healed.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.058
JOHANSEN:
 How is that possible?

00:58.092 --> 00:59.160
CHLOE: I don't know.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.640
Hey. What are you
 doing in here?

01:18.779 --> 01:20.080
Are you okay?

01:22.116 --> 01:23.817
I don't know
 how I got here.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.790
The last thing I remember,
 I was lying down for a nap.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.091
Sleepwalking?

01:34.328 --> 01:36.997
I used to do it
 all the time as a kid.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.967
My dad
 had to put an alarm on
 the front door to make...

01:40.000 --> 01:41.769
I'll see you later.
 O...

01:43.771 --> 01:44.772
...kay.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.408
ELI: Seriously.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.743
And it's not
 just this one thing.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.712
She's been
 acting a little
 odd for a while now.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.083
You know what
 I'm talking about, right?
 It's not just me noticing...

01:56.116 --> 01:57.818
No, no.
 You're right.

01:57.851 --> 02:01.255
She's been
 acting...different.
 She's quiet and withdrawn.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.990
We should talk
to her about it.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.726
I did. I mean,
I tried, yesterday.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.162
And?

02:08.196 --> 02:09.863
And nothing.
She wasn't in the mood.

02:09.896 --> 02:11.799
She was too busy
 writing in her diary.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.268
She keeps a diary?

02:14.302 --> 02:16.103
It's kind of
 a therapy for her.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.638
It's all the stress
of being on the ship...

02:17.671 --> 02:20.441
And what about that
 gunshot wound on her leg?

02:20.474 --> 02:22.210
No one heals that fast.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.278
How do you explain that?

02:24.312 --> 02:25.379
Eli, I can't.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.785
You need to
use the stones.
Your mother's sick.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.687
What...
 (CLEARS THROAT) Is she...

02:33.721 --> 02:35.389
I don't know the details.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.157
Just that
 they want you
 to go back as soon...

02:58.279 --> 03:00.381

 You need to sleep, Nic.

Yes, yes. Soon.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.030
(COUNTDOWN CLOCK ACTIVATES)

03:17.064 --> 03:19.199
Manipulating
 the countdown clock is

03:20.401 --> 03:22.436
complicated,
 to say the least.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.840
So many
 variables tied into it.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.876
Well, that's the problem,
 isn't it?

03:28.909 --> 03:31.845
A myriad of systems,
 each as complicated
 as the next.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.182
Made worse by one man
 trying to do the work
 of an entire crew.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.018
Well, for now, I just
 need to control the
 countdown clock,

03:38.051 --> 03:41.789
and if
 you are indeed the ship,
 why aren't you helping me?

03:41.822 --> 03:44.124
What are you really
 hoping to gain?

03:45.893 --> 03:48.862
Control of the ship
 is key to the mission.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.964
(ON RADIO) Dr. Rush,
 this is Brody. Come in.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.134
Go ahead.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.936
We just dropped
out of FTL.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.905
Yes, I'm aware of that,

03:57.938 --> 04:00.207

 we're banking left,

I can't get away right now.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.324
Where are you?
 What are you doing?

04:16.357 --> 04:17.891
Rush, out.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.892
This is
getting ridiculous.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.829
Getting old,
 is what it is.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.500
BRIGHTMAN: She stopped
 taking her treatment.

04:26.534 --> 04:31.171
Unfortunately, her counts
dropped, dipping below 300.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.240

 for pneumonia.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.975
We've re-started
 the AVR therapy,

04:35.008 --> 04:37.478
and we're successfully
treating the pneumonia.

04:37.511 --> 04:41.281
Her counts have leveled off,
 so physically, she's on
 the mend.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.817
But if she stops taking
her treatment again...

04:43.851 --> 04:45.085
Don't let her.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.454
Okay, when
she returns home...

04:46.487 --> 04:48.155
Don't release her.
 Keep her here.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.290
We will monitor
 her condition closely,

04:50.324 --> 04:52.326

 me is she is still

04:52.360 --> 04:54.495
clearly suffering from
 depression.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.930
One of
 our psychiatrists
 has been treating her,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.800
but hasn't
 made much progress,
 which is why we sent for you.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.937
Look, whether here or at home,
 she has to want to get better.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.475
There's no room for error now.
 If her counts drop
 below 200...

wanted to be here,

 they've got him
 pretty tied up.

 though, working really hard.

He told me
 about your condition.

He heard
 you stopped taking
 your meds, and he's really...

06:35.395 --> 06:38.265

 a different situation,
 away from this ship,

 that I don't mess this up.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.868
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

13:23.670 --> 13:25.338
Morning.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.539
You up for company?

13:27.640 --> 13:28.541
Sure.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.545
You're looking better.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.981
Doctor said you'll be
 out of here in no time.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.583
Why doesn't he call me?

13:38.051 --> 13:40.353
It's been months now.
 Nothing.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.821
It's not like him.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.661
Okay, okay.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.699
What's your favorite movie
 of all time?

13:52.732 --> 13:54.367
What?

13:54.401 --> 13:56.636
Just go with me on this.
 Your favorite movie.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.505
Grease.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.974
No, there's another one.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.342
Sound of Music?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.010
No, what...

14:05.512 --> 14:07.480
Your favorite
 science fiction movie?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.749
(SIGHS) I'm not a fan of...
 E.T.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.153
Right?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.055
That's your favorite.
 Yes.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.558
I love that movie.

14:18.591 --> 14:22.595
You rented it and showed it
to him when he was a kid.

14:22.629 --> 14:26.066
You wondered
 if aliens really existed.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.935
If it's possible
 to fly spaceships

14:27.968 --> 14:29.869
to other planets in
 other solar systems.

14:29.903 --> 14:30.870
What has this
got to do with...

14:30.904 --> 14:31.939
It is

14:33.706 --> 14:35.608
possible.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.711
Not just to other solar
 systems, other galaxies.

14:38.745 --> 14:42.015
You see,
the government,
they have this program,

14:42.049 --> 14:44.117
the Stargate program.

14:44.151 --> 14:47.520
And what a Stargate is,
is it's like a doorway.

14:47.554 --> 14:51.591
It allows you to step through
 and travel great distances
 through space,

14:51.624 --> 14:53.693
halfway across
 the universe
 in some cases...

14:53.726 --> 14:55.895
Why are you
 telling me this?
 Because I am Eli.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.703
I'm on a ship,
 far, far away,

15:03.736 --> 15:07.040
but my consciousness
 is in this person's body.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.777
It really is me, Mom.
 I am your son.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.550
JOHANSEN: You have no
 memory of going into
 the storage room?

15:17.584 --> 15:21.154
No, I fell asleep
in my quarters.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.556
Next thing I know,
 I'm talking to
 Lieutenant James.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.659
This isn't the first time
 this has happened, is it?

15:26.693 --> 15:30.730
It's like I black out
 from time to time.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.066
Those aliens used
 the communication stones

15:33.100 --> 15:34.567
to take control
 of Lieutenant James.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.902
Because we forgot to
 reset them.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.137
I was just in
the communications lab.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.739
The stones are clean.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.075
Listen, there doesn't seem to
 be anything physically wrong
 with you that I can tell.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.645
I'd need an EEG or
 a CAT scan to be
 more thorough.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.714
I would like
 to keep her overnight,
 though, for observation.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.849
That's a good idea.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.255
And once
 the stone is in place
 and the device is turned on,

15:55.288 --> 15:57.490
you actually
 swap consciousness

15:57.524 --> 15:58.992
with the person
 on the other end.

15:59.026 --> 16:03.030
You go into their body
 and then they go into
 yours, and...

16:05.298 --> 16:06.699
And...

16:06.733 --> 16:09.036
You don't believe me.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.204
I don't understand.

16:11.238 --> 16:14.107
I know.
 I know it's weird.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.942
Where is Eli?

16:15.975 --> 16:19.012
He's on a ship, okay,
 the Destiny,

16:19.046 --> 16:20.880
on the other side
 of the universe.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.215
When is he coming home?

16:22.249 --> 16:24.684
I don't know,
 it's a long, long way.

16:24.717 --> 16:25.785
Billions of
light years
from Earth.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.886
How did he get there?

16:26.919 --> 16:28.721
The Stargate, Mom!

16:28.755 --> 16:30.557
Okay. Okay, Mom...

16:30.590 --> 16:32.925
Stop calling me that.
 You are not my son.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.568
The day Dad left,

16:43.736 --> 16:44.837
I was 14.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.841
I ran up to my room, crying.

16:51.911 --> 16:55.715
You came up, told me that
 I needed to be strong
 for you.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.019
You said I needed to
 be the man that he wasn't.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.691
Remember?

17:09.561 --> 17:11.798
How could I know that
 if I wasn't Eli?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.935
He could've told you.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.271
How could he possibly have
 told me every little thing
 about his...

17:19.306 --> 17:21.074
Leave me alone!

17:21.108 --> 17:23.242
(SIGHS)
 Please, Mom.
 It really is me.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.844
Nurse, nurse!

17:24.877 --> 17:26.045
I know it's a lot
 to take in. Mom?

17:26.079 --> 17:28.080
Nurse! Please leave.
 Please.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.894
JOHANSEN: What is it?
 Ancient?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.229
RUSH: Some of it.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.931
Those symbols,
they looked familiar to me,

18:18.965 --> 18:21.000
and then I remembered
 where I saw them.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.002
In the crashed
 alien ship.

18:23.035 --> 18:26.105
Some of this I understand,
 but most of it's too
 far advanced.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.807
They must've
 done something to her,

18:27.840 --> 18:29.909
planted something
 in her brain.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.279
You said
 she didn't have any
 tracking devices in her.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.748
No, she didn't.
 Not that I was aware of.

18:35.782 --> 18:40.320
There may be
 something happening to
 Chloe on a cellular level.

18:40.353 --> 18:44.791
Some kind of
 genetic manipulation
 gradually changing her.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.092
Into what?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.660
You think
 she's changing
 into one of them?

18:47.694 --> 18:49.128
I want her quarantined.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.130
We don't know for sure
 if that's what's
 going on here.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.265
We cannot just
 lock her up.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.267
Until we know
 what's wrong with her,

18:54.301 --> 18:56.969
I can't risk
 letting her walk around
 free on this ship, can I?

18:57.003 --> 18:59.272
I think the risk
 might be worth it.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.274
If we can monitor
 her behavior,

19:01.308 --> 19:04.977
the frequency
 of her blackouts, where
 she goes, what she does,

19:05.011 --> 19:08.114
we might
 gain more insight into
 what's actually happening.

19:08.147 --> 19:12.051
Certainly quicker than
 isolating her in a room.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.221
She's not to be
 left alone, ever.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.155
Yes, sir.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.063
WRAY: Hey.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.133
Thanks for coming.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.669
I didn't have anyone else
 I could call.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.407
Well, how's your mom doing?

19:36.776 --> 19:39.045
Physically, fine.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.382
Her pneumonia's healing.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.351
Her T-cell counts
 are stable now that

19:44.384 --> 19:46.353
they've restarted
 her therapy, but she's...

19:48.888 --> 19:52.425
I was always
 worried she might give up
 if something happened to me,

19:52.459 --> 19:55.161
and now, she's...
 Nothing's happened to you.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.764
She doesn't even know
 it's me.

19:57.797 --> 20:02.034
I tried to tell her.
 But as far as she's concerned,

20:02.068 --> 20:05.338
the military
 took her son away,

20:05.372 --> 20:10.109
won't even
 tell her where he is or
 won't let him talk to her.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.016
I would give up too.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.050
Eli,

20:19.118 --> 20:21.354
no one is giving up.

20:21.388 --> 20:26.726
You know, whether
 she believes you or not,
 she has to take her meds.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.296
And you need to
 make her understand that.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.131

20:36.769 --> 20:39.071

to visit my mom.

 till we figure out what's
 going on here.

 time for a shift change.
 I'll take over from here.

I'm afraid.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.455

 I won't let her
 out of my sight.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.825
It's all right.

20:59.992 --> 21:00.993
Okay.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.163
I'll check in
 on you later.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.100
Come with me.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.351

they'd be here a while,

might as well
 give themselves
 some measure of comfort.

How long will they be
 tagging along with us?

 give them reason to.

Yes, I know. I heard.

 diplomatic person
 in our group.

 on his homeworld
 was rougher than most.

decided to release him,
but if he slips up again...

23:09.956 --> 23:12.425
I'll talk to him.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.226
We're trying to
 make this work.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.328

 it's because of pulsar damage.

There would be a pattern
 to the jump intervals,
 however frequent they are.

There's also the changes in
the ship's course once
we drop out of FTL.

 too coincidental that

He needs to be where he is
 right now, so I need you
 to figure it out.

27:01.220 --> 27:04.423
YOUNG: Why is
 your radio off?

27:04.456 --> 27:07.259
Sorry, I was in
 my quarters sleeping.
 Wrong.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.796
You didn't answer my call,
 I sent Corporal Barnes to
 your quarters.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.197
Where were you?

27:12.531 --> 27:14.466
Okay, so what's happening?
 What's wrong?

27:14.500 --> 27:15.802
Just trying to figure out
 what's going on with Destiny.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.636
Where the hell were you?

(DOOR OPENING)

27:27.513 --> 27:28.781
What's this?

27:28.815 --> 27:30.850
I come here to think.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.385
And write
 on the walls?

27:33.419 --> 27:35.454
Working on problems
 that have confused us

27:35.487 --> 27:37.489
since we set foot in
 this ship, Mr. Brody.

27:39.558 --> 27:41.393
This one has been
 particularly frustrating,

27:42.261 --> 27:43.162
and yet Chloe,

27:44.396 --> 27:45.698
she solved it
 in a minute flat.

27:47.734 --> 27:51.904
Whatever alien
 influence she's under,
 it's studying this ship.

27:51.938 --> 27:55.742
So you think she's hijacked
the ship's system during
one of her blackouts?

27:55.775 --> 27:58.677
Something she could have set
 in motion days, perhaps even
 weeks ago.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.719
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

28:26.705 --> 28:27.940

It is now.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.246
Why?
 Back to your quarters.

28:38.284 --> 28:39.952
You're going to
keep doing this,
are you?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.356
Pushing me.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.392
Get me to do something
 so you can lock me
 back up.

28:46.425 --> 28:47.459
Back

28:47.493 --> 28:48.861
to your

28:48.895 --> 28:49.962

You're talking tough,
 you're armed,

28:54.600 --> 28:56.402
you got your men
 here covering you.

(DOOR OPENING)

29:45.484 --> 29:46.385
You okay?

29:55.727 --> 29:56.963
Just let me know

29:58.831 --> 30:00.432
and we'll get you
whatever you need.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.001
Colonel's just doing
 this as a precaution.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.338
What do they think
 is happening to me?

30:08.674 --> 30:10.442
They don't know yet.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.478
I feel like
 I'm slipping away,

30:14.480 --> 30:15.647
bit by bit.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.316
No.

30:18.750 --> 30:22.054
No, no.
We're going to
figure this out.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.023
We're going to fix it.
 I promise.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.667
WRAY: You can't sleep?

30:42.441 --> 30:43.910
I look at you, and

30:45.111 --> 30:47.346
I know it's you,
 but still,

30:50.616 --> 30:52.684
I miss

30:52.718 --> 30:53.852
your face,

30:57.089 --> 30:58.457
your voice.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.762
This is hard.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.365
Probably worse on you
 than it is for me.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.807
This situation,

31:17.876 --> 31:21.413
it's so
easy to lose hope.
I've seen it in others.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.749
But what keeps me sane

31:25.217 --> 31:27.753
are these
few moments
we're together.

31:27.786 --> 31:31.557
Being able to come
home and see you and...

31:32.891 --> 31:35.594
And hold you.

31:35.627 --> 31:38.597
Even if it's just
 for a day or a minute,

31:41.567 --> 31:43.970
it's... It's what's
keeping me going.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.740
(SOBBING)

31:52.011 --> 31:53.980
I'll be okay.
 (SIGHS) I know.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.148
I'll be okay.
I'll be okay.
 I know.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.021
JOHANSEN:
It's coming up now.

32:03.022 --> 32:03.990
There.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.895
And she just sits
 there the whole time?
Yes.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.064
In her earlier one,
she wrote in the diary.

32:12.098 --> 32:15.834
But mostly she just sits
 or lies still, staring
 at the walls.

32:15.867 --> 32:18.070
I still can't detect
 any physical changes
 in her.

32:18.104 --> 32:22.074
Without proper equipment,
 I don't really know
 what else I can do.

32:22.108 --> 32:24.743
Colonel, I know
 you're just doing this to
 keep her away from others,

32:24.776 --> 32:26.979
but quarantine is
 not a long-term solution.

32:28.780 --> 32:29.781
I know.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.761
Nurse?
 Wait, no.

32:42.794 --> 32:46.132
Please, just listen,
 and then I'll leave.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.168
I promise.

32:49.201 --> 32:52.538
Whether you
 believe me or not,

32:52.571 --> 32:55.007
the fact is,
 (SIGHS) I'm worried.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.044
Eli's worried.

33:00.012 --> 33:02.081
I can't leave you here
 like this.

33:10.889 --> 33:12.691
He was all that I had.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.928
He's why I got up
 in the morning.

33:18.664 --> 33:21.067
Never realized it fully
until he was gone.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.204
Just tell me,

33:27.173 --> 33:29.007
will I ever
 see him again?

33:34.346 --> 33:36.014
(SOBBING)
I don't know.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.018
(SIGHS)

33:45.191 --> 33:48.827
I can't leave her like this.
 I can't go back to that ship.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.262
If I leave her,
she's going...

33:50.296 --> 33:52.664
WRAY: Eli.
 Eli, listen to me.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.267
Whatever happens,
 you will get through this.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.669
Maybe you could
 talk to her.

33:57.703 --> 34:02.007
Someone else
 from the Stargate program.
 Maybe then she'll believe me.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.942
I've got a better idea.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.777
I'll call you right back.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.853
WRAY: I know
 it's beyond her clearance.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.922
You're just
 going to have to
 make an exception.

34:17.956 --> 34:19.625
He unlocked
 the ninth chevron.

34:19.658 --> 34:23.129
He's quite possibly the most
 important person on that crew.

34:23.161 --> 34:27.632
We need him to be
 emotionally healthy, focused.

34:27.666 --> 34:28.900
You know what,
 I'm not asking you.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.636

make this happen.

Pretty cool, isn't it?

35:37.169 --> 35:37.969
Yeah.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.439
I know.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.775
I was speechless
 at first, too,

35:43.809 --> 35:46.945
if you can
 believe that.

35:46.978 --> 35:50.216
It's an amazing ship.
 We're still trying
 to figure it out.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.887
See if
 there's some way
 we can get back home.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.159
I'll never stop trying.
I promise.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.836
We're going
 to be okay, Mom,

36:11.737 --> 36:13.104
you and me.

 I'm so proud of you.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.747

didn't it?

36:21.780 --> 36:23.215
ELI: Oh, yeah.

36:23.249 --> 36:25.784
She's leaving
 the hospital tomorrow.

36:28.119 --> 36:30.356
Thanks for letting her
 come here.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.324
And don't worry, she knows
 it's a one-time thing.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.192
She won't be asking
 to come by every week.

36:35.060 --> 36:37.863
Anyway, I owe you one.

36:37.896 --> 36:41.333
You owe Wray.
She's the one
who made it happen.

36:41.367 --> 36:44.035

 Colonel Young, come in.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.937
Yeah, go ahead.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.073
I think
 I have a solution
 to Chloe's condition.

36:48.106 --> 36:48.974
Well, let's hear it.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.010
RUSH: The neural interface.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.144
The chair?

36:55.046 --> 36:57.082
I believe
 it can cure her.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.792
Look,
it's relatively simple.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.127
From what I've
learned so far,

37:09.160 --> 37:11.863
I believe the chair will not
 allow any non-human to
 interface with it.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.865
There are safeguards
 built in

37:13.899 --> 37:16.034
that would destroy
 any alien life form
 that tries to use it.

37:16.067 --> 37:19.271
So the chair kills off
 any potential alien
 matter inside her,

37:19.305 --> 37:20.906
while leaving her
 human side unaffected.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.474
RUSH: Exactly.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.776
You "believe,"
 meaning you're not sure?

37:24.810 --> 37:26.945
Well, no, I can't be
 absolutely certain...

37:26.978 --> 37:28.113
It's too dangerous.

37:28.146 --> 37:30.449
Look, I've made
improvements to the
program I developed

37:30.482 --> 37:32.318
when I used the chair.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.786
They should prevent
 her from being harmed.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.789
I'm now able to
 sever the connection
 externally, at any time.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.225
She shouldn't have
to sit in it very long,
a few seconds at most.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.328
If you can't be
 100% sure, I don't...

37:42.361 --> 37:44.095
It's the best option
 anyone's come up with.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.999
The only option.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.336
Colonel, you can't
 force her to do this.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.770
Well, then, I'll ask her.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.080

 you're okay with this?

38:02.113 --> 38:05.083

38:05.116 --> 38:07.986

won't activate till
I input the proper command.
