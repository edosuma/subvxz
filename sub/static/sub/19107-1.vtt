00:53.253 --> 00:54.953
Hey, Katie.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.221
How you been? Sorry,

00:56.223 --> 00:58.190
it's been a while,
I've been really busy.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.725
Oh, yeah. That's okay.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.160
I've been busy too.

01:01.961 --> 01:03.228
I'm good.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.464
How's the new job?

01:05.465 --> 01:07.032
It's good.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.668
I mean, it's moma. So...

01:09.670 --> 01:13.605
You know, but I'm really
just tearing tickets and...

01:13.607 --> 01:16.708
Pointing directions,
it's not exactly curating.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.044
You think you'll stay?

01:19.046 --> 01:21.480
Yeah, maybe, we'll see.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.416
How have you been?

01:25.351 --> 01:26.885
Good.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.987
Good. I was kind of
all over the place.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.756
I was out of town for a while.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.158
Then just really busy trying to
keep up with everything.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.628
Well, that's good, right?

01:37.430 --> 01:38.363
Yeah.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.435
Listen, Katie...

01:45.105 --> 01:47.606
The reason I wanted to meet
with you...

01:47.608 --> 01:51.977
Oh, I just I felt like
i needed to tell you...

01:51.979 --> 01:55.080
And I'm sorry
i haven't been around a lot,
i haven't been avoiding you.,

01:55.082 --> 01:57.349
or anything, I promise.
It's just...

01:58.551 --> 02:00.552
I don't think
we should see each other,

02:00.554 --> 02:02.688
or whatever, any more.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.457
You know it's just...

02:05.459 --> 02:07.893
And I'm just
in such a weird place right now,

02:07.895 --> 02:10.596
in my life,
and I feel like things
are going a certain way

02:10.598 --> 02:15.400
that I need to nip it
in the bud before it gets
too serious, you know?

02:15.402 --> 02:18.203
And listen, honestly,
this has nothing to do with you.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.339
Or, wait, I mean.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.207
That isn't what I mean.
What I mean is...

02:22.209 --> 02:25.043
This isn't because
there's something wrong with you
or something I don't like.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.879
All right, there isn't.
I mean, I like you.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.247
I really do.

02:28.249 --> 02:32.084
And you're smart, and fun,
and funny. Beautiful.

02:32.086 --> 02:35.053
And I'm basically
being a selfish idiot right now
and if you told me that

02:35.055 --> 02:36.388
I'll regret this
and I'm making a mistake,

02:36.390 --> 02:38.123
I probably wouldn't argue
with you.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.992
Yeah, but that's part of
what I'm saying.

02:39.994 --> 02:42.227
You know,
since we get along really well,

02:42.229 --> 02:45.898
and haven't been any problems
or anything, I just think
it's going in a certain way.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.934
In a certain, more serious way.

02:48.936 --> 02:52.604
And that's the natural thing
to happen, it's just not...

02:52.606 --> 02:54.706
Where I want to be going
with my life right now.

02:56.976 --> 02:57.943
More coffee?

03:00.980 --> 03:02.514
We're fine, thanks.

03:04.751 --> 03:08.253
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

03:08.255 --> 03:10.222
I just, uh...

03:10.224 --> 03:11.657
I didn't say anything.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.728
I didn't ask you to be
in a relationship with me.

03:18.097 --> 03:20.132
I didn't put
any pressure on you even.

03:20.134 --> 03:23.268
I know. And you weren't clingy
or possessive.

03:23.270 --> 03:26.505
Or anything bad. I know.

03:26.507 --> 03:29.374
You know, but that doesn't mean
the seriousness wasn't there,
it was creeping up.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.544
I don't think you can deny that.
It just creeps up
after a certain amount of time.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.614
Yeah, but I don't understand.
Can't we just
keep the status quo?

03:35.616 --> 03:38.350
I don't think
there is any such thing.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.486
Things are changing all the time
and I can just see...

03:41.488 --> 03:43.622
Our trajectment in this
is not where I want to be going.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.692
I don't want to be
in a relationship.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.328
I'm not asking you to be.

03:50.763 --> 03:51.830
But you want to.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.333
Says who?

03:54.801 --> 03:56.401
I'm sorry.

03:56.403 --> 04:00.005
I don't mean to...
Put feelings on you
i just think...

04:00.007 --> 04:03.008
That we've gotten really close
really fast
over the past few weeks so...

04:04.410 --> 04:05.844
I don't want to be close.

04:07.614 --> 04:08.714
With me.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.984
No, with anyone.

04:11.986 --> 04:14.419
But how can you say that?

04:14.421 --> 04:17.022
You can't just remove me
from this like that.

04:18.423 --> 04:21.159
You, you don't want to be
with me.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.828
You don't know everybody.

04:23.863 --> 04:25.163
You haven't met everybody.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.531
If you meet someone tomorrow,

04:26.533 --> 04:29.001
fall head over heels with her,
and want to be with her.

04:29.003 --> 04:29.501
I guess.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.503
I doubt it.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.773
I'm looking for a
very specific thing,
i know what it is, or...

04:35.775 --> 04:37.476
You know...

04:37.478 --> 04:39.511
Gonna know
when I see it and...

04:39.912 --> 04:40.979
I don't see it.

04:43.483 --> 04:44.483
A thing?

04:45.852 --> 04:47.452
Come on, you know what I mean.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.888
No, I don't, James.
I really don't. I...

04:51.557 --> 04:53.058
Is it love?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.559
Are you looking for love?

04:56.362 --> 04:57.796
Do you know that word?

04:59.165 --> 05:01.300
Now, that's what I'm trying
to avoid.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.769
Somebody being in it
with me, anywhere.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.804
But if you were...

05:06.773 --> 05:09.041
If you were, like,
in love with me...

05:09.043 --> 05:10.809
You wouldn't stop yourself.

05:11.678 --> 05:12.678
You couldn't.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.682
-I guess that's true.
-Yeah.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.952
-What do you want me to say?
-I want you to shut the fuck up.

05:22.221 --> 05:26.024
I want this conversation
to never have happened.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.897
But since it has happened,
since we can't go
back in fucking time, I...

05:33.666 --> 05:36.501
I want you to talk to me
like a man.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.071
Throw me in the garbage
like you want to, instead of...

05:39.073 --> 05:43.108
Talking around it,
and acting like
you're doing me a favor.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.345
I want you to tell me
that you don't love me,

05:46.347 --> 05:49.014
or like me all that much really.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.515
And that you never will.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.396
I don't. I never will.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.069
Fine.

06:14.907 --> 06:16.074
Katie, wait.

07:33.352 --> 07:35.153
I need to go to the bathroom.

08:48.594 --> 08:51.162
Go, bro. Go, bro. Go, bro.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.707
Oh, shit.

09:37.977 --> 09:38.944
Monica!

09:56.729 --> 09:57.662
Hey!

09:59.098 --> 10:00.098
Monic--

10:40.506 --> 10:41.640
hey.

10:43.976 --> 10:44.909
Hey.

10:45.444 --> 10:46.778
You found me.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.847
Thank, god. I was so scared.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.682
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.019
Goddamn it.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.722
There should be sign that says,
"no fuckin'."

11:32.058 --> 11:34.993
-You guys need to get off
my fucking bus right now.
-Whoa, sorry.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.395
I'm sorry. Okay, really,
i apologize.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.531
-But, we're newlyweds.
-What?

11:39.533 --> 11:42.067
Look, please don't kick us out.
We're in the middle of nowhere
in the middle of the night.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.302
It's dangerous.
All right? Please.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.541
You can't fuck.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.476
We're not-- we're not fucking.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.944
Okay? We're...

11:52.946 --> 11:54.813
Look. Hey, look,
I'll sit over here.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.381
Okay? I'm sitting over here.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.149
Okay? Is that okay?

11:58.151 --> 11:59.718
All right, I guess so.

12:48.033 --> 12:50.168
-Come on.
-I'm fine.

12:59.545 --> 13:00.779
Hold on.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.320
Fuck!

13:09.322 --> 13:12.590
-Are you serious?
-I must have left them upstairs.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.125
Damn it.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.827
I'm sorry.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.192
Not out here.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.895
- It's not lady-like.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.311
James, no!

14:06.313 --> 14:09.447
We're not fucking outside
on the street, okay?

14:11.684 --> 14:12.951
Okay.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.054
Fine, I'll climb
the fire escape.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.489
James, no. You're crazy.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.262
Where's your place?

14:26.799 --> 14:28.099
It's far.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.072
Well, can't you call someone?

14:34.074 --> 14:36.174
Who, it's four in the morning.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.979
Hold on, I got a missed call.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.282
-Yeah, it's from me.
-No.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.787
Hey!

14:49.789 --> 14:52.323
It's me. Sorry, I was out.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.524
I'm locked out.

14:54.593 --> 14:55.960
Are you home?

14:57.096 --> 14:58.096
Okay.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.998
I'll be right there.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.004
Sorry, dude.

15:07.439 --> 15:08.840
Gotta go to bed.

15:08.842 --> 15:12.777
I can't go adventuring
with you for another hour
to find your place.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.913
So my friend lives
around the block.

15:14.915 --> 15:18.283
Call me, seriously. Please.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.184
You're adorable.

15:29.161 --> 15:30.662
Oh, fuck.

15:38.404 --> 15:39.537
Fuck.

16:08.701 --> 16:09.901
So do I know this guy?

16:09.903 --> 16:11.069
No, I just met him.

16:11.071 --> 16:14.372
He's really hot though,
and smart.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.874
I mean, he looks smart.
I haven't talked to him
that much.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.076
But he invited you.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.244
Yeah, true.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.581
Enough. He told me
where he was going.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.117
That's why you're here.
We're stopping by.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.685
So I don't look so desperate.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.087
But you are desperate.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.456
But I don't have to look it.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.292
Just act like
you're my guy friend.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.394
Don't let him think
you could be my boyfriend.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.398
Could you, like,
act gay or something?

16:41.266 --> 16:43.134
How, you want me
to suck his dick?

16:43.136 --> 16:45.770
No, that dick is mine.

16:45.772 --> 16:49.040
Here's my dick. And I'm gonna
take a dick for you.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.815
- How's work?

16:57.817 --> 17:00.918
Will is such an asshole.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.621
-He showed me a picture
of his dick the other day.
-What?

17:03.623 --> 17:05.323
-Yeah.
-What, like,
he sent you a dick pic?

17:05.325 --> 17:09.660
No, he said, "hey, come here,
i want to show you something...

17:09.662 --> 17:13.531
On the computer,"
and I go over there,
and it's his dick.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.601
He starts laughing.
I was horrified.

17:18.002 --> 17:19.604
That's sexual harassment,
you know?

17:19.606 --> 17:21.239
Yeah, I know.

17:22.273 --> 17:24.976
Oh, really who has the time?

17:24.978 --> 17:26.711
Anyway, it's just a dick.

17:31.283 --> 17:33.384
If he tries to rape me
or something,

17:33.386 --> 17:34.786
I'll stab him.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.788
Right in the neck.

17:36.790 --> 17:39.290
-I've been practicing.
-Oh, okay.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.261
Whatever, he's so gross.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.397
So...

17:46.399 --> 17:49.634
-Who you fuckin'?
-Come on, I don't kiss and tell.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.436
But, do you fuck and tell?

17:51.438 --> 17:52.403
Or that.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.874
That reminds,
guess who I ran into
the other day.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.843
-Who?
-Guess.

17:58.845 --> 17:59.777
Just tell me.

18:00.846 --> 18:01.779
Lorraine.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.650
Oh. How is she?

18:06.585 --> 18:09.320
She seemed good.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.889
She wasn't too happy
to see me though,
i don't think.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.124
Yeah, why not?

18:13.126 --> 18:15.960
-You two were always friends.
-Yeah.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.329
It was fine
until I mentioned you.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.331
That sour.

18:21.366 --> 18:22.300
Yeah.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.840
Sorry, I didn't...

18:29.541 --> 18:31.309
No, it's fine.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.079
Just every time
i think about her...

18:35.081 --> 18:37.215
Reminds me of
how much of an asshole I am.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.753
You're not an asshole.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.525
Oh, okay. Hey.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.161
Let's go mingle.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.597
-I'm okay here.
-No, come on.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.932
No, it's okay.
Just go find your boy.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.534
Come with me.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.369
Please.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.538
I'm not sure
how familiar you are
with these artists,

19:00.540 --> 19:03.274
but basically,
their whole concept is that...

19:03.276 --> 19:05.610
Basically, I want to
take the idea
of two become one,

19:05.612 --> 19:08.412
and just like see how far
they can take that
where two humans

19:08.414 --> 19:10.014
became as similar as possible.

19:10.016 --> 19:13.050
And they were husband and wife,
and so what that meant is that

19:13.052 --> 19:15.052
they got breast implants
that looked alike.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.454
They dress alike.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.989
- They, hey...
- -Hey.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.658
Um, they have very similar,

19:20.660 --> 19:23.394
well, they have
exactly the same haircut,

19:23.396 --> 19:26.264
which is kinda funny to watch,
if they said, like,

19:26.266 --> 19:28.132
"here's what we're going
to do today," and I was, like,

19:28.134 --> 19:29.667
"why?" And they're like,

19:29.669 --> 19:33.838
"no." Like that was when
they kind of
would get excited, right?

19:33.840 --> 19:37.408
My entire dynamic with them went
from being just like,

19:37.410 --> 19:40.311
a guy that got to work
with his heroes to a guy
who just had to

19:40.313 --> 19:42.313
constantly fight his heroes.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.282
And like,
everything that they would do

19:44.284 --> 19:45.616
I would challenge, right?

19:45.618 --> 19:47.485
And I'm not a
very combative person, like,

19:47.487 --> 19:50.288
sort of, like depending
on the situation where I need
to be I can like step up.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.057
I think what you're recognizing
is that

19:53.059 --> 19:56.060
this friendship
was getting a little...

19:56.062 --> 19:57.695
Toxic, and...

19:57.697 --> 20:02.266
You know, it's not really
a two-way street
in terms of like,

20:02.268 --> 20:05.069
you know, the way
that she's relying on you, and

20:05.071 --> 20:07.738
you know,
what you get in return...
I just...

20:08.507 --> 20:10.408
Excuse me, do you have the time?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.377
Sorry, my phone just died.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.213
Yeah.

20:16.481 --> 20:17.815
Nine thirty.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.117
Thanks.

20:20.119 --> 20:23.688
Anyway, so I think I need
to just, sort of,

20:24.223 --> 20:26.524
put a little distance.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.793
-I don't know.
-I'm gonna get a drink.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.194
-Do you want anything?
-No.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.863
I'm fine. Thank you.

20:39.004 --> 20:40.404
You took my seat.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.374
Oh, um...

20:43.376 --> 20:45.977
-I'm sorry.
-No, don't, I'm kidding.

20:45.979 --> 20:48.312
Well, you did. But don't get up.

20:48.314 --> 20:51.582
- You might tear it.
-Okay.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.685
Thank you.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.620
Sure.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.389
So, who do you know here?

20:58.391 --> 21:00.591
I'm a stranger here myself.

21:03.061 --> 21:04.428
I, uh...

21:05.097 --> 21:07.898
I'm here with him.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.867
-This one?
-Yeah.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.168
He know someone here.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.370
Sure.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.838
That mustache guy.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.640
Yeah.

21:15.642 --> 21:18.109
And so now, I'm like sort of,
thinking like,

21:18.111 --> 21:19.910
what could I possibly do next.

21:20.879 --> 21:23.047
And I haven't
figured it out yet, but I'm

21:23.049 --> 21:25.683
I don't know, pretty confident
that I'll figure out something.

21:27.986 --> 21:29.520
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.055
So thanks for inviting me.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.556
Yeah, I'm glad you could come.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.259
Listen, I...

21:35.261 --> 21:37.461
I have something
i want to show you.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.765
Can you take me
into another room?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.700
Definitely.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.605
-I'll think of it.
-Okay.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.778
Just watch your head, okay?

21:53.780 --> 21:55.346
Okay, thanks.

21:57.716 --> 22:00.318
Well, my friend
just went up with him, so...

22:00.320 --> 22:01.619
Um... she likes him.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.354
-She likes who?
-She likes that.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.822
Looks like I'm stuck with you.

22:07.292 --> 22:08.526
Oh, sorry.

22:15.367 --> 22:16.967
-Any word?
-No.

22:18.437 --> 22:21.238
Feel like, maybe we should go
after this drink.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.873
Really?

22:22.875 --> 22:26.777
Yeah, I just had
sort of a long day,
and I either need to...

22:26.779 --> 22:30.448
Go home now,
or get totally hammered.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.416
It's so early.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.018
I know, but I'm just...

22:34.020 --> 22:35.453
I can feel-- oh, wow.

22:35.455 --> 22:38.055
Look who's phone
magically came back to life.

22:39.458 --> 22:41.359
Why would you, like...

22:41.361 --> 22:43.260
Tell someone
your phone died and...

22:43.262 --> 22:46.464
I just want to stay.
Can we stay, like, a little bit longer, please?

22:46.466 --> 22:49.500
-Just getting to know
some people.
-Okay.

22:49.502 --> 22:54.105
All right. Great. Yeah,
let's stay at the weird party
we're having a good time, so...

22:54.107 --> 22:55.539
I am, yeah.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.752
Hey, I'm really sorry,
i have to go.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.954
I'd love to hang out sometime,
can I get your number?

23:17.996 --> 23:18.929
Thanks.

23:23.635 --> 23:24.568
Bye.

23:27.005 --> 23:29.573
He thought I had coke
or weed or something.

23:29.575 --> 23:30.941
He didn't want to make out
with me.

23:39.384 --> 23:40.684
I hate boys.

23:41.887 --> 23:42.820
I know.

23:43.488 --> 23:44.789
They're terrible.

23:46.658 --> 23:47.591
Hey...

23:48.260 --> 23:50.027
Cheer up. All right?

23:50.896 --> 23:51.829
Look...

23:58.036 --> 23:59.303
Who cares?

23:59.305 --> 24:01.739
I mean, he's an asshole, right?

24:02.207 --> 24:03.574
Yeah, he is.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.544
You're not, though.

24:07.646 --> 24:10.815
I know that, deep down.

24:11.516 --> 24:13.484
Even though you think you are.

24:18.657 --> 24:21.826
I hope would do one
or the other.

24:24.062 --> 24:26.096
Shh.

24:27.265 --> 24:28.599
All right. Here we are.

24:29.234 --> 24:30.201
Here's you.

24:33.171 --> 24:34.839
Where's the cat?

24:34.841 --> 24:38.175
I don't know.
He's hiding
around here somewhere.

24:40.779 --> 24:41.712
Roger?

24:47.185 --> 24:48.185
All right.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.188
This is a sheet for you.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.523
Thank you.

25:00.298 --> 25:01.232
Perfect.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.017
Oh, fuck.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.819
-Gross.
-What?

25:22.587 --> 25:24.188
Fuck, he pissed on...

25:24.190 --> 25:25.856
-No.
-Oh, shit.

25:25.858 --> 25:26.824
Really?

25:27.058 --> 25:29.527
Oh.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.695
Ew.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.631
Roger.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.067
Look, I'll just go home.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.503
No, it's okay.
Just sleep in my bed.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.005
But stay on your side.

25:42.774 --> 25:43.707
Okay.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.551
Oh, come on, Jesus.

26:27.553 --> 26:29.954
What,
i thought you liked
that sort of thing.

26:32.190 --> 26:33.190
What is that?

26:33.458 --> 26:34.592
What?

26:35.093 --> 26:36.026
Is that your boner?

26:36.028 --> 26:37.194
Quit it, all right?

26:37.196 --> 26:38.662
Okay.

26:38.863 --> 26:39.930
Okay.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.834
I just had no idea
you had such a big dick.

26:45.403 --> 26:48.205
-I thought we were supposed
to tell each other these things.
-It's not that big.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.076
Maybe it's just cause
it's so hard.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.226
Get over here already.

27:36.221 --> 27:37.154
Hold on.

27:38.523 --> 27:39.790
Oh, boy.

28:01.312 --> 28:02.846
Stop looking at me like that.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.182
Sorry. It's just...

28:06.885 --> 28:08.886
-It's weird.
-Shut up.

28:09.454 --> 28:10.854
No, it's not.

28:30.508 --> 28:31.442
Wow.

28:32.477 --> 28:33.911
That felt good.

28:34.179 --> 28:35.179
Yeah.

28:39.484 --> 28:42.252
-But--
-it was probably a mistake.

28:44.923 --> 28:45.856
Yeah.

28:46.891 --> 28:47.825
Okay.

28:49.494 --> 28:50.928
But Jesus...

30:18.583 --> 30:19.950
There we go.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.752
I'm sorry again, I'm always on
time.

30:21.754 --> 30:24.154
I know you are. I was worried.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.824
That I'd blow you off?

30:26.826 --> 30:29.426
I don't know, that you were,
like, hit by a bus or something.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.661
Yeah, you hoped it was that.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.730
So what are you doing
with your days in Hollywood

30:33.732 --> 30:35.432
besides playing with bands
from New York?

30:36.167 --> 30:37.434
-Ha!
-Ah.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.738
I'm working on
some of my own stuff.

30:41.740 --> 30:46.109
Thinking about turning it, like,
into an opera or something.
I don't know.

30:46.111 --> 30:48.545
I've also been doing
some acting.

30:48.547 --> 30:49.880
Believe it or not.

30:50.348 --> 30:51.582
But...

30:51.584 --> 30:55.085
Mostly I'm just,
you know, serving hamburgers.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.854
Well, you do look like
a movie star.

30:57.589 --> 30:58.889
It's only a matter of time.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.624
Thanks.

31:02.627 --> 31:03.827
What about you?

31:03.829 --> 31:06.096
How many exciting things
you have going on?

31:06.965 --> 31:09.833
Exciting? I don't know, been...

31:09.835 --> 31:12.769
Getting some work, you know,
doing videos and photos
and stuff.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.271
Working with some cool people.

31:15.073 --> 31:15.939
Like who?

31:15.941 --> 31:17.541
What, you want me to name drop?

31:17.543 --> 31:19.009
Sounds like you want to.

31:22.881 --> 31:27.017
Anyway, mostly I've just been
living like a transient,
drinking too much.

31:27.752 --> 31:29.920
As usual.

31:29.922 --> 31:32.522
Waking up
in other people's beds.

31:32.524 --> 31:34.191
I like my own bed just fine.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.527
I'm kidding. I don't care.

31:45.470 --> 31:46.937
You are so pretty.

31:53.478 --> 31:54.444
Hey, everybody.

31:55.713 --> 31:57.080
Threesomes suck.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.050
You think
they're gonna be awesome,

32:00.052 --> 32:02.119
and you get excited
'cause there are two chicks.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.688
But it's more like
running a party as a host

32:04.690 --> 32:07.090
and you got your clipboard
and you're like,
"how we doing over here?

32:07.092 --> 32:10.360
You had your tits rubbed?
Okay, lets do some pussy-eating
down here and

32:10.362 --> 32:12.629
why don't you,"
and you can't talk like that.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.032
You can't be like,
"why don't you?"
You get to be like...

32:15.034 --> 32:16.600
Get over here.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.271
Sit on her fucking face.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.839
And, so
while you're doing this...

32:22.841 --> 32:26.343
You're doing it,
because you're gonna
beat off to that night

32:26.345 --> 32:28.045
when you're 72.

32:28.047 --> 32:31.581
You're essentially working
for your old dick.

32:43.828 --> 32:45.262
So...

32:46.197 --> 32:47.731
What are you gonna do
when you get back?

32:49.600 --> 32:50.968
Go back to work.

32:51.436 --> 32:52.402
I don't know.

32:53.504 --> 32:55.138
No, I mean your real work.

32:55.606 --> 32:56.540
Oh.

32:57.475 --> 33:00.410
Well, I don't really
have any plans.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.512
Guess I'll just wait to see
what comes to me.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.083
Well, some days it's hard,

33:06.085 --> 33:09.653
like, if I have a day off
i just won't leave the house,

33:09.655 --> 33:11.121
'cause I don't know what to do.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.258
I don't get that.

33:15.260 --> 33:18.695
I mean, I'm constantly obsessing
over all my plans.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.565
I can't stand it when things
don't go accordingly.

33:21.567 --> 33:24.334
No, what if something good
comes from it?

33:24.336 --> 33:26.670
I don't know.
Even then, it just bothers me.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.438
I thought you loved spontaneity.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.541
- Yeah, in other people.

33:36.781 --> 33:38.782
Why do you put tobacco
in your joints?

33:40.651 --> 33:42.352
I don't know.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.756
I went to Europe once,
and they do it there.
Just kind of stuck.

33:46.991 --> 33:48.392
You got addicted?

33:50.161 --> 33:51.294
-Maybe.
-Yeah.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.297
That's how
i started smoking cigarettes.

34:10.782 --> 34:13.449
Just... burns better.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.257
So what about you, Mr. planner?

34:20.259 --> 34:22.125
What are your plans anyway?

34:26.597 --> 34:27.664
Oh, I can't.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.299
Too embarrassed.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.268
Please, when are you shy?

34:31.936 --> 34:33.804
When asked to talk about myself.

34:35.639 --> 34:36.639
Come on.

34:39.777 --> 34:40.710
No.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.282
-It's nothing.
-Oh, pl-- you're so full of it.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.217
-I know.
-Yeah.

34:47.618 --> 34:48.552
I'm sorry.

34:50.822 --> 34:51.755
Tell me...

34:52.255 --> 34:53.523
What do you wanna do?

34:55.293 --> 34:57.294
I won't tell anyone, I promise.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.101
It's not just one thing.

35:05.436 --> 35:06.369
What do you mean?

35:09.607 --> 35:10.707
I'm gonna do a lot.

35:11.642 --> 35:12.843
You know, a lot of a lot.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.251
I'm tired.

35:23.721 --> 35:24.654
Yeah.

36:43.234 --> 36:44.668
That was so beautiful.

36:46.871 --> 36:47.904
You wrote that?

36:48.439 --> 36:50.440
It's Beethoven, stupid.

36:54.879 --> 36:55.812
Wow.

37:23.007 --> 37:23.940
Cut!

37:24.542 --> 37:25.475
Okay.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.410
When she cuts that piece off,

37:27.412 --> 37:29.813
feel the loss, it looked like
you were smirking over it.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.282
When we get to the end of this,
and it's welcome
to mustache heaven

37:32.284 --> 37:34.618
and you reunite
with that piece
of the mustache,

37:34.620 --> 37:38.088
if you don't feel bad
about losing it here,
we have nowhere to go.

37:38.090 --> 37:41.891
Those mustaches are hilarious,
and everything else about it
is completely humorless.

37:42.660 --> 37:43.827
We go again, please.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.429
Before I start crying.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.698
Okay, everyone.
We are going again.

37:52.903 --> 37:53.837
Can we get this...

37:54.438 --> 37:55.372
Reset?

38:41.619 --> 38:42.552
Hey.

38:43.521 --> 38:44.454
Hey.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.722
What's your name?

38:45.724 --> 38:47.490
-James.
-Anna.

38:48.292 --> 38:49.826
Yeah, I know who you are.

38:50.761 --> 38:52.162
You get a date with that girl?

38:52.164 --> 38:53.396
Which girl?

38:53.398 --> 38:55.665
Oh, come on, you know
who I'm talking about.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.301
I got her number.

38:58.303 --> 38:59.569
You gonna call her?

39:00.071 --> 39:01.638
I don't know, maybe.

39:02.306 --> 39:03.707
Then why'd you ask for it?

39:05.409 --> 39:07.177
To see if she'd give it to me.

39:10.114 --> 39:13.416
You know, you really broke
my concentration in there.

39:14.952 --> 39:16.586
I'm not kidding.

39:16.588 --> 39:19.089
That wasn't okay.
You should know better.

39:20.124 --> 39:21.958
-Seriously?
-Yeah, seriously.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.227
I'm trying to listen
and you're making faces
at me.

39:24.229 --> 39:27.364
-I wasn't making faces--
-you know,
you could've gotten me fired.

39:28.399 --> 39:30.467
You owe me big time.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.369
Owe you what?
What are you talking about?

39:33.504 --> 39:35.038
Thought you were a gentleman.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.141
Guess I was wrong.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.642
What would a gentleman do?

39:40.811 --> 39:42.912
I'm unpracticed.

39:42.914 --> 39:45.648
Find out what she likes
and bring it to her.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.051
I like bourbon, for example.

39:48.853 --> 39:49.953
Where would I bring it?

39:51.188 --> 39:52.956
Not that clever either, huh?

39:54.291 --> 39:56.559
I don't know
what she sees in you.

40:19.650 --> 40:21.151
Hey. What's up?

40:22.353 --> 40:23.953
Hey, I'm James.

40:24.522 --> 40:25.955
Hi, James. I'm Dean.

40:29.794 --> 40:31.127
Can I help you?

40:31.129 --> 40:33.363
Yeah, I brought this for Anna.

40:33.365 --> 40:34.831
-Okay. Thanks, man.
-Uh...

40:35.833 --> 40:36.766
Is she home?

40:38.102 --> 40:39.869
She's in the bathroom.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.871
-Most delivery guys--
-oh, she was...

40:41.873 --> 40:44.240
Kind of expecting me,
i thought maybe I could say hi.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.175
We work together.

40:49.647 --> 40:50.580
Okay.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.195
I said I'm almost done.

41:05.197 --> 41:07.864
Darling--
who cares if we're late?

41:07.866 --> 41:09.866
- Baby, you have a guest.
- Who?

41:10.334 --> 41:11.468
Some kid.

41:12.736 --> 41:13.670
James.

41:16.774 --> 41:18.475
- Honey, what do you--
-tell him...

41:18.477 --> 41:19.809
I'll be out in a minute.

41:22.680 --> 41:23.947
She'll be out
in a minute.

41:39.363 --> 41:40.830
Do you want me to wait for you?

41:41.799 --> 41:42.765
I will.

41:47.271 --> 41:51.508
No, baby. Don't worry about it.
You know how long I take.

41:51.510 --> 41:54.210
I'll meet you over there though,
after the surprise.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.714
Apologize for me, okay?

42:02.419 --> 42:03.553
Thanks.

42:08.459 --> 42:09.592
Enjoy.

42:11.262 --> 42:12.695
-Thanks, man.
-All right.

42:56.307 --> 42:57.340
What do you think?

43:01.011 --> 43:02.145
I prefer the mustache.

43:03.315 --> 43:04.747
I can go put it on.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.115
Would you like that?

43:09.019 --> 43:10.053
It's a nice place.

43:10.521 --> 43:11.654
Thanks.

43:12.156 --> 43:13.222
You lived here long?

43:14.725 --> 43:16.926
You mean,
have I lived here
with him long?

43:18.596 --> 43:20.196
I wasn't gonna
bring him up actually.

43:22.833 --> 43:23.833
Yeah.

43:24.068 --> 43:25.001
Wow.

43:25.769 --> 43:27.637
He's maybe serious.

43:28.372 --> 43:30.440
-I don't know.
-So hard to tell.

43:30.442 --> 43:31.941
It is.

43:35.479 --> 43:37.113
So, you have
a girlfriend, James?

43:38.983 --> 43:40.617
No, not really.

43:42.786 --> 43:43.853
I see.

43:44.421 --> 43:45.722
That's what I thought.

43:48.993 --> 43:50.793
Man, oh, man.

43:51.662 --> 43:53.529
I used to be like that.

43:53.531 --> 43:56.766
Well, I always had a boyfriend.

43:56.768 --> 44:01.037
But they never meant anything
to me, I always just did
whatever I wanted.

44:03.173 --> 44:04.974
What are you doing?

44:04.976 --> 44:07.243
-What does it look like?
-I have a boyfriend.

44:08.512 --> 44:09.879
-But you just said--
-that was...

44:09.881 --> 44:11.914
-Then. Wow,
you're a horny little bastard.
-Yeah.

44:11.916 --> 44:12.915
-Aren't you?
-I'm impulsive.

44:12.917 --> 44:15.618
Be impulsive
with girls your own age.

44:15.620 --> 44:17.120
What is wrong with you?

44:17.122 --> 44:19.956
-You wouldn't get me off
anyway.
-Whoa, stop it!

44:20.391 --> 44:22.025
All right?

44:22.027 --> 44:24.661
What are you gonna do about it?
Fucking child!

44:24.663 --> 44:27.930
You fucking chum!
You're a towel piece of shit!

44:27.932 --> 44:30.533
You can't just come here
and fuck me 'cause you want to.

44:30.535 --> 44:32.702
You fucking mediocre...

44:32.704 --> 44:38.074
You're a five at best,
you're not handsome.
You're not anything. Fuck you.

44:49.653 --> 44:50.987
You ruined my shirt.

44:53.390 --> 44:54.724
I'm sorry.

44:56.460 --> 44:58.461
I get a little crazy sometimes.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.421
My first girlfriend gave me
this shirt.

46:37.427 --> 46:38.861
Fuck that bitch!

46:38.863 --> 46:40.329
Holy shit. What the fuck?

47:24.908 --> 47:26.375
What are you doing?

47:39.923 --> 47:41.424
Without a condom?

47:41.792 --> 47:43.226
Are you kidding?

47:43.228 --> 47:45.361
Get the hell out of here,
will you?

47:48.432 --> 47:49.665
Are you acting right now?

47:49.667 --> 47:51.467
I'm always acting.

47:54.504 --> 47:56.439
Oh, fuck you too then.

48:17.561 --> 48:18.661
I'm leaving now.

48:18.663 --> 48:20.229
You do as you're told.

48:21.932 --> 48:23.566
I don't get you, man.

48:23.568 --> 48:25.468
Who says you're supposed to?

48:26.703 --> 48:28.271
I thought we liked each other.

48:28.273 --> 48:30.206
We don't even know each other.

48:32.743 --> 48:34.477
Well, then why'd you
invite me here?

48:34.479 --> 48:35.411
I don't know.

48:36.246 --> 48:38.114
I thought you
might be interesting.

48:40.117 --> 48:41.050
I'm not?

48:42.386 --> 48:43.753
Not to me.

48:43.755 --> 48:45.321
I know you too well.

48:45.323 --> 48:46.956
I thought we didn't know
each other.

48:48.425 --> 48:49.792
The type.

48:49.794 --> 48:50.927
I'm not a type.

48:55.666 --> 48:57.199
I don't even have
a shirt any more.

48:58.335 --> 48:59.535
You'll survive.

49:01.805 --> 49:03.673
Oh, and by the way,

49:04.641 --> 49:07.009
Jameson isn't bourbon.

49:07.011 --> 49:08.911
It's Irish whiskey.

49:08.913 --> 49:10.680
You should learn the difference.

49:47.084 --> 49:49.118
Hey, it's me. I'm here.

49:49.120 --> 49:51.253
When we said right on time,
are you...

49:51.255 --> 49:52.655
Listen, I really need it back
right now.

49:52.657 --> 49:55.291
You're kinda fucking up my plans
right now, sorry, but...

49:56.693 --> 49:58.694
Fuck! Call me back, okay?

50:00.297 --> 50:01.230
Lorraine?

50:01.999 --> 50:03.532
Hey, uh, hi.

50:03.534 --> 50:06.969
Thanks for calling me back.
Sorry to bother you.

50:06.971 --> 50:08.904
I have that book you lent me.

50:08.906 --> 50:10.806
You know,<i> women.</i>

50:10.808 --> 50:12.308
Just thought I'd give it
back to you.

50:13.944 --> 50:15.678
Oh, come on, of course you care.

50:17.180 --> 50:18.914
I mean, it's signed.

50:18.916 --> 50:21.283
Look, I have it.
I'm in your neighborhood.

50:21.285 --> 50:22.651
What do you mean?
I have it with me.

50:26.823 --> 50:28.357
I know. I know you're busy.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.627
I know, I just thought...

50:31.629 --> 50:34.463
I don't know.
I'm trying to be a nice guy.
Do you have a few minutes?

50:37.968 --> 50:39.101
Right now?

50:42.005 --> 50:44.673
Yeah, okay. I'll...

50:44.675 --> 50:46.542
Yeah, I'll meet you in the park
by the...

50:46.544 --> 50:49.478
By the-- yeah, okay, cool.
Thanks. All right.

50:49.480 --> 50:50.413
Bye.

50:50.647 --> 50:51.580
Fuck!

50:55.252 --> 50:58.454
Come on. Pick up, pick up. Shit.

51:12.302 --> 51:13.602
- Hey.
- -Hey.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.708
Did you bring the book?

51:19.710 --> 51:21.544
Like I said, I'm in a hurry.

51:21.546 --> 51:24.580
-What is that?
-It's my dress for tonight.

51:24.582 --> 51:25.581
What's tonight?

51:25.583 --> 51:26.715
I have a show tonight.

51:27.851 --> 51:29.185
That's great.

51:29.187 --> 51:31.353
-Where is it?
-Odds and ends.

51:31.788 --> 51:32.822
I love that place.

51:33.356 --> 51:34.290
What time?

51:35.625 --> 51:36.559
Nine.

51:37.561 --> 51:38.794
All right.

51:38.796 --> 51:41.363
Oh, you have plenty of time.

51:42.065 --> 51:43.432
Wanna walk around a bit?

51:43.434 --> 51:44.233
-Uh...
-It's beautiful out.

51:47.838 --> 51:49.438
-Can I see the dress?
-No.

51:52.008 --> 51:54.310
You didn't even bring the book,
did you?

51:55.011 --> 51:55.945
It's up there.

51:55.947 --> 51:57.780
Jesus, you gotta be kidding me.

51:57.782 --> 51:59.315
Come on, it's right there.

51:59.317 --> 52:00.850
We'll go grab it
in a second, okay?

52:04.421 --> 52:06.522
This has got to be
the biggest venue you played at.

52:06.923 --> 52:07.923
You nervous?

52:07.925 --> 52:09.592
I am now, thanks.

52:10.260 --> 52:12.261
Come on, you'll do great.

52:12.263 --> 52:14.930
You always used to say that,
it doesn't mean anything.

52:14.932 --> 52:16.198
What am I supposed to say?

52:16.200 --> 52:18.467
I don't know,
the truth, I guess.

52:18.469 --> 52:21.337
I'm not lying, I do actually
think you'll do great.

52:21.339 --> 52:23.072
Just because you think you suck
doesn't mean--

52:23.074 --> 52:24.640
I don't think I suck.

52:24.642 --> 52:27.042
Glad I got you
to finally admit that.

52:27.044 --> 52:30.012
Just my throat's
been bothering me, but...

52:30.014 --> 52:32.515
I'll just have to power through.

52:32.517 --> 52:35.117
How's the band?
Still working stuff out?

52:35.119 --> 52:38.554
No, that's over.
We couldn't even agree
on the color of the sky.

52:39.789 --> 52:41.257
Even we can do that.

52:50.600 --> 52:52.401
When did you move here?

52:52.403 --> 52:54.603
I just have to run upstairs
real quick.

52:55.038 --> 52:56.272
Okay.

52:59.676 --> 53:01.343
Did you forget your keys
or something? I don't--

53:01.345 --> 53:02.478
hold on one second.

53:03.346 --> 53:04.680
Hey, it's me again.

53:04.682 --> 53:06.715
Look you're really supposed
to be home right now.

53:06.717 --> 53:09.985
Where are you? Look, I know
I'm not your favorite person
right now but if...

53:09.987 --> 53:12.154
I just need the book back,
all right?

53:12.156 --> 53:14.590
Then I'll get out of your hair.
If you don't give it back to me
I'm just gonna keep calling.

53:14.592 --> 53:15.691
Okay? Call me back.

53:16.059 --> 53:17.193
Fuck!

53:19.229 --> 53:20.462
I can't believe you.

53:20.464 --> 53:22.164
Seriously, you lent it
to another girl?

53:22.166 --> 53:25.134
-You said it was--
-your bullshit doesn't work
on me any more.

53:25.136 --> 53:27.636
This is great.
I wasted my entire afternoon.

53:30.674 --> 53:31.473
Wasted?

53:31.475 --> 53:33.409
Look, I'm gonna go, um...

53:33.411 --> 53:35.010
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

53:35.012 --> 53:36.812
Come on, Jesus. Hold on.
I'll call back.

53:43.920 --> 53:46.622
Hey, yeah, I'm sorry.

53:46.624 --> 53:47.923
I just need it back.

53:47.925 --> 53:49.892
It somebody else's
and they need it back right now.

53:51.094 --> 53:52.261
An hour or two?

53:53.029 --> 53:55.397
Okay, but for real this time?

53:55.399 --> 53:57.366
Yeah, I'm gonna be waiting
around here.

53:57.368 --> 53:59.568
Yeah, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay.

54:03.173 --> 54:04.707
-An hour?
-Or two.

54:06.743 --> 54:07.776
You want to wait?

54:07.778 --> 54:09.812
If I don't,
I'll never get it back.

54:11.615 --> 54:13.382
If it's only an hour,
you won't be late for your show.

54:13.384 --> 54:14.817
If it's two, I will.

54:19.356 --> 54:21.724
Come on, I know a good place.
They have great tea.

54:21.726 --> 54:23.359
All right?
It'll help your throat.

54:32.969 --> 54:33.969
It's good, huh?

54:35.138 --> 54:36.272
Yeah.

54:42.612 --> 54:43.679
So, are you...

54:44.814 --> 54:47.316
Like, happy...

54:47.318 --> 54:48.851
With your life right now?

54:52.122 --> 54:53.322
I'm pretty lonely.

54:54.090 --> 54:55.057
I'm bored.

54:56.293 --> 54:57.459
Feel empty...

54:58.061 --> 54:59.328
Most of the time.

55:01.731 --> 55:02.965
Are you surprised?

55:04.234 --> 55:05.801
No, of course not.

55:07.170 --> 55:08.704
And of course, you were right.

55:08.706 --> 55:10.773
About how things
would turn out for me.

55:10.775 --> 55:12.908
Am I supposed to be happy
about this?

55:14.044 --> 55:15.444
Just thought you'd wanna know.

55:16.346 --> 55:17.479
Some sorta...

55:18.748 --> 55:20.282
Vindication, I guess.

55:20.284 --> 55:22.017
That is so stupid.

55:22.019 --> 55:23.218
I can't even believe it.

55:23.220 --> 55:24.753
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

55:25.355 --> 55:26.622
Hey, you asked.

55:27.157 --> 55:28.557
What do you want from me?

55:29.392 --> 55:31.060
I want my fucking book back.

55:53.917 --> 55:55.951
Thank you all
for coming tonight.

55:55.953 --> 55:58.787
I'm Lorraine,
this is Charlie on the piano.

55:58.789 --> 56:02.691
I'll be playing
some new songs tonight,
and some old ones.

58:40.484 --> 58:41.817
Thank you.

58:48.258 --> 58:50.592
Hey. You were great.

58:51.361 --> 58:52.995
How can you say that?
I fucked up.

58:53.429 --> 58:54.596
No one noticed.

58:54.598 --> 58:55.864
You're right,
no one was here to notice.

58:57.467 --> 59:00.302
-Well, there were
some people here.
-Don't patronize me, okay?

59:01.905 --> 59:02.838
I'm not.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.274
You were great.

59:05.276 --> 59:08.176
-All right?
You had one bad moment--
-why did you come here anyway?

59:10.146 --> 59:11.547
I wanted to see the dress.

59:15.451 --> 59:16.585
Well,

59:17.787 --> 59:19.187
I brought you your book back.

59:35.338 --> 59:37.072
You weren't supposed
to see that.

59:39.075 --> 59:39.074
See what?

59:39.076 --> 59:41.944
See me fall
on my face like that.

59:43.179 --> 59:44.680
You're not supposed to see me...

59:46.015 --> 59:46.949
Until...

59:47.750 --> 59:49.885
-Until when?
-Until I...

59:49.887 --> 59:52.888
-Till you're rich and famous?
-Until I can
at least draw a crowd.

59:52.890 --> 59:55.724
God, you make me sound
so fucking stupid.

59:58.461 --> 01:00:00.829
-Lorraine...
-You make me sound so stupid.

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:03.932
Lorraine, I don't know
what you--

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:06.101
just shut up, James.
Just shut the fuck up.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.673
Can't you just
take a compliment?

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:20.816
Okay.

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:53.775
So...

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:57.345
Can I see you again?

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:09.825
James, I don't...

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.121
I did love you.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:23.965
I loved you, too.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.504
You're early.

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:03.839
So are you.

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:06.141
You're never early.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:07.976
I am tonight.

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:10.178
Eh, I'm diggin on fashion.

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:11.847
Thanks.

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:15.383
Welcome back.

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:16.418
Unless you're weird.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.786
It does.

01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:20.488
It's like I went from one planet
to another.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:21.990
Can't even process it all.

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:23.525
Got Louise back, yeah?

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:27.662
I missed you.

01:04:27.664 --> 01:04:28.630
You look beautiful.

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:31.099
Thank you.

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.269
So how was it?

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:35.370
Tell me everything.

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:37.505
Everything?

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:39.307
I don't know if I can.

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:43.345
Still contemplating it all.
It's hard to articulate.

01:04:43.347 --> 01:04:44.913
I was in Paris first.

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:46.681
And I stayed
with Paul's parents.

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:49.017
Which was weird,
but it was fine.

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:50.719
Because I get along
with his mom.

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:53.622
She didn't ask
about me and him, so...

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:55.156
And I had a lot of fun
being there.

01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:56.925
You know,
i know so many people there now,

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:58.927
all these French society types.

01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:01.296
So I went to all these, like,
balls or whatever.

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:02.664
Like a <i> debutante.</i>

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:05.033
And I wore a fancy dress
and pearls.

01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:06.768
It was all borrowed, of course.

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:08.303
Yeah, I bet you looked great.

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:11.539
There might've been
really cool people there.

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:12.674
And practice your French?

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:13.275
Yeah.

01:05:13.277 --> 01:05:17.612
And a bunch of people
were taking a road trip
to Berlin.

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:19.547
So, I went with them.

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:23.318
But they were so unorganized,
and we had to pile up
into this shitty little hostel,

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.686
without enough beds.

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:28.957
And there was this boy,
back in Paris.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:30.692
He told me he loved me, there.

01:05:30.694 --> 01:05:32.127
It was so weird.

01:05:32.129 --> 01:05:34.896
So, he wanted to come with us
on the trip, but we said no,

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:37.198
because we thought
it would be too awkward.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.535
A couple of days into our trip,
he showed up.

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:43.538
Claiming that
he had mutual friends
or whatever the excuse was.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.274
It was so creepy.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:49.344
So, I kinda ran away from him.

01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:50.545
And fled to Prague.

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:55.116
Anyway, it was great.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:58.620
It was so much craziness,
i can't even process it all.

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:00.655
Yeah, you said that.

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:03.191
Yeah.

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:07.395
Listen, James...

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.232
I met someone.

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:27.015
Yeah, I thought that was comin'.

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:30.251
Sorry.

01:06:30.253 --> 01:06:34.022
-But I met someone.
-Yeah, I heard you.
What does that mean?

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.958
Means that I met someone
that I like.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.261
And I want to give it a chance,
and I can't do that
if I'm still seeing you.

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:41.329
Since when?

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:44.799
-James...
-You know, you could've opened
with that.

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:47.802
You know, save me the trouble
of parsing through your story
for fucking clues.

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:49.270
James, please don't be cruel.

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:52.140
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
what are you saying?

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:54.442
I mean, who'd you meet?

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:58.480
This guy. He's French.

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.148
Met him through friends.

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:03.018
All right. The one
that followed you.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:05.153
No. Not him.

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:10.458
Of course, you had
more than one guy
fall in love with you.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:13.495
Not surprised.
That always is the gist
of your fucking stories.

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:15.363
James...

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:20.301
What are you saying?

01:07:20.303 --> 01:07:23.138
What, are you gonna do,
some long distance thing?
That's so stupid.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.674
No. He's moving here.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:28.443
In two months.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:32.647
Well, that's great.

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:35.784
When nothing happens
in two months, I'm sure you guys
will feel the exact same way

01:07:35.786 --> 01:07:37.252
about each other.

01:07:37.254 --> 01:07:39.554
You were only gone
for three weeks
for Christ's sake.

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:41.756
I know.

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:47.295
I mean, how do you even know
this is anything?

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:49.697
I don't.

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:51.466
But you're willing to throw away
what we have?

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:54.302
What do we have?

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.171
I don't know.

01:07:56.173 --> 01:07:58.473
We've been seeing each other
a long time.

01:07:58.475 --> 01:08:01.676
Maybe not seriously
or anything, but...

01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:03.178
We're close, aren't we?

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.613
-Yeah.
-So what the fuck?

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.318
I mean, you're gonna throw
that away
without giving me a chance?

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:16.524
I had no idea
you even wanted a chance.

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:23.531
I didn't know
i wanted one either
till about a minute ago.

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:27.301
Look, this isn't going anywhere.

01:08:27.304 --> 01:08:29.069
You know, if it was,
it would have by now.

01:08:29.072 --> 01:08:31.238
Not without either of us
saying something.

01:08:32.073 --> 01:08:33.207
You're right.

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:36.778
But did you?
I mean, did you say anything?

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.549
Well, maybe I am now.

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:44.652
It's too late.

01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:47.721
You know, he's coming here,
and I miss him already.

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.861
You didn't miss me?

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.468
No you didn't.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.638
You didn't want me to.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.573
Says who?

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:09.544
Look, there might've
been a time, okay?

01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:12.180
Sometime, where we
could've made a real go
of it, but,

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:15.617
you didn't ask and I didn't know
and all we ever do is get drunk
and fuck.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.385
-Jesus.
-Be honest.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.554
Have we ever
slept together sober?

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:22.290
Have we ever
even spent the day together

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:24.325
apart from a brunch
the morning afterwards?

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.127
It's not a relationship.

01:09:26.129 --> 01:09:28.529
You can't just put this
on me right now.

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:34.836
We could've had it.

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:37.337
And I really think that.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.377
Then why did you never say it?

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:46.714
I...

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:51.653
James, you were seeing
other people.

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:52.587
So were you.

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.223
Not really.

01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:58.293
Lily.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.830
You were enough for me.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:08.736
You're killing me.

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.506
We can both
take the blame, okay?

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:14.909
Doesn't that make you sad?

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.513
A little.

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:20.782
Yeah.

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:28.389
We do so many stupid things.

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:31.626
I don't know why.

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:34.963
It's okay.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.672
Lily, please.

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.908
All right, now that's it out
in the open,
why don't we give this a shot?

01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:48.509
Give it two months.

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:50.411
Right?

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:52.413
Look, if we try,
maybe you can forget him.

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:54.249
It's not fair.

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:56.417
This isn't fair.

01:10:58.287 --> 01:11:00.255
Look, you had your chance.

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:01.556
He hasn't.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.693
You're making a mistake.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:09.597
It's mine to make.

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:16.738
Well, leave.

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:06.321
Okay.

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:10.558
Okay.

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:06.547
Jesus, forget everything.
Come home with me.

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:08.583
I can't.

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.491
Let me just walk you home then.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:20.862
I don't think you should.

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:29.771
Come on, it's late,
and I've made you see me.

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:32.106
Let me just try once
for our love.

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:43.951
Okay.

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.560
What you got going on this week?

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:31.532
Just working.

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:32.667
I don't know.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:34.702
Sarah has that thing.

01:14:35.704 --> 01:14:38.072
Yeah. I was gonna go to that.

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:39.941
Maybe I'll see you there.

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.044
Yeah.

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:45.046
Maybe.

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.490
Okay then.

01:14:55.858 --> 01:14:56.724
Good night.

01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:59.627
Could I use the bathroom?

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:03.798
My mom's staying with me.
She's sleeping in my bed,
i don't want to wake her.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.867
I'm sorry,
i just really have to go.

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:09.103
I'll be quiet. I promise.

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:11.539
I don't know.

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:15.209
It's a long way home for me.

01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:17.245
Please.

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:21.749
Okay.

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:45.346
Can I bum a smoke?

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.282
Yeah, of course you can.

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.020
Thanks.

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:56.190
You old enough for that?

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:58.125
Yeah.

01:19:58.727 --> 01:20:00.461
You old enough
to be in that bar?

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:03.864
I'm 21.

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.268
What? I am.

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:08.903
Okay. Okay.

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:11.906
Okay, fine.

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:14.375
I'm 18, I have a fake ID.
Happy now?

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:17.144
Why don't you
buy your own cigarettes then?

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:21.348
I don't
buy my own drinks either.

01:20:23.718 --> 01:20:24.852
Anyway,

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:27.421
age doesn't
really mean anything.

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:30.958
It does to some people.

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:35.563
Well, it doesn't to me.

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:38.966
Whatever you say.

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:41.836
What?

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:43.404
You don't agree?

01:20:43.406 --> 01:20:45.439
I bet you don't hear
a lot of disagreement.

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:47.508
Almost out of precedent.

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.078
Good.

01:20:55.817 --> 01:20:57.451
I'm gonna go back inside, okay?

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.854
Okay.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.416
Buy us drinks?

01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:33.888
Sure.

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:36.123
Oh, this is sade.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.526
-Hi, sade.
-Hi.

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:42.129
- Two shots Tequila.
- -From the top shelf.

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:01.916
Thanks.

01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:03.550
Yeah, my pleasure.

01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:04.618
We'll be back.

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:10.391
It's a 20.

01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:22.970
Just a minute.

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:29.610
What? Just hold on.

01:22:34.383 --> 01:22:37.451
I can't believe
such a fuck up.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:37.451
Where's that bitch?

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:41.388
Did you see a crazy,
psycho bitch banging
down the door?

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:43.257
-She freaked me out.
-Yeah, you scared her off.

01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:44.525
Jesus, fuck!

01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:46.560
Hey, can I get some?

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.028
What?

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:52.166
Come on, please.
I could really use a bump.

01:22:52.168 --> 01:22:55.235
Why, sir, what f do you mean?

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.554
I'm an idiot.

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:24.665
All right, calm. Come on.

01:26:26.282 --> 01:26:28.215
- We're not gonna fuck you.
- -You're old.

01:26:28.217 --> 01:26:31.919
-You're too fucking old.
-You're a fucking fucked up
old man.

01:26:31.921 --> 01:26:33.987
You're embarrassing.

01:26:33.989 --> 01:26:37.991
Buy us some more drinks faggot,
and maybe you can lick my shoes.

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:38.412
Hello?

01:28:38.613 --> 01:28:39.713
Hi.

01:28:39.715 --> 01:28:41.982
I'm in here. I'm just putting
some make-up on.

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:46.320
You're up here very fast.

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:51.158
There's coke on the,
um, you know.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.327
And there's a beer in the...

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:56.063
Thanks.

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:01.027
How are you doing?

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:05.432
Jesus.

01:30:05.434 --> 01:30:07.968
-You wouldn't believe my night--
-oh, my god.

01:30:08.469 --> 01:30:10.137
Oh, I love this song.

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.114
God, I love your cock.

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:44.691
Wait, wait, wait.
All right? Hold on.

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:45.892
I...

01:32:47.161 --> 01:32:48.094
What, darling?

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:50.564
I...

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.066
I forgot a condom.

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:58.171
-Are you kidding?
-No, no. I'm sorry.

01:32:58.173 --> 01:33:00.206
-I'll just go get one.
-What the fuck?

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:03.176
Yeah, go get one then.

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:06.713
Don't you remember?
I don't buy them.

01:33:07.548 --> 01:33:08.682
I know.

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:14.020
You'll still come
on my face though, right?

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:17.557
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

01:33:17.559 --> 01:33:21.027
Because you didn't last time,
and I had to pour it
out of the condom.

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:23.997
I remember.

01:33:25.366 --> 01:33:26.700
It's not as good.

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:31.371
-Okay.
-Hurry back, beautiful.

01:33:31.373 --> 01:33:33.039
My friend Molly's coming over.

01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:35.609
I told her all about you.
She wants to meet your cock.
