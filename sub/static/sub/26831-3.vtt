22:48.201 --> 22:50.286
(beeping)

23:48.219 --> 23:50.221
(train rumbling)

24:12.451 --> 24:14.745
DENNIS: I can't tell
which two fingers are mine.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.372
Holy shit.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.457
Fuck.
(panting) Can you?

24:18.499 --> 24:20.877
Dennis, come on. Quiet down.

24:20.918 --> 24:23.087
Does anybody have
another finger?

24:23.129 --> 24:25.089
-Are we missing one?
-Yeah.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.675
Also, ow, man.

24:27.717 --> 24:30.052
Fuck, it hurts to get shot.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.054
They look exactly
the fucking same.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.389
How is that possible?

24:33.431 --> 24:35.308
-We're-we're two men.
-Dennis,

24:35.349 --> 24:37.393
you got to quiet down, man.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.562
I sell big pipes.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.147
What the fuck?

24:41.189 --> 24:42.565
(crying):
I sell big pipes.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.775
Hey. You're going into shock.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.569
Can I go to the hospital
this time?

24:46.611 --> 24:48.112
No, you went to the hospital
last time.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.697
That's why we're all shot now.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.992
Why doesn't everybody shut
the fuck up here?

24:53.034 --> 24:55.786
I don't know, man.

24:55.828 --> 24:59.624
Why don't we find, like,
a disgraced veterinarian?

24:59.665 --> 25:02.460
I'm not going
to a French cat doctor.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.670
-Dennis.
-Cats don't have fingers.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.923
-Apes do. Sort of.
-Yeah.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.300
Oh. Okay.

25:09.342 --> 25:13.971
Well, we'll just find a fucking
French ape doctor, Edward.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.806
It's 2:00 in the morning.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.059
Dennis, you saved my life, man.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.061
Come on.
You can keep it together.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.896
You came through.

25:21.938 --> 25:23.898
Blue ribbon balls.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.525
I would put a blue ribbon
on your balls, man,

25:26.567 --> 25:29.153
if I had a blue ribbon.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.863
Yeah, McClaren.

25:30.905 --> 25:32.865
But you have to quiet down.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.867
I don't want you
getting arrested.

25:34.909 --> 25:37.245
You're my best friend, man.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.925
Dennis, cover up those fingers.

25:50.967 --> 25:55.012
Put your hand in your coat
and don't follow me.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.266
Eddie, leave at the next stop.

I'm a... consultant

27:57.134 --> 27:59.178
with a governmental department

27:59.220 --> 28:03.349
that collects intelligence
and implements processes

28:03.391 --> 28:06.936

28:06.977 --> 28:08.646

28:08.687 --> 28:12.650
I don't know shit about
Donnelly nut spacing systems

28:20.199 --> 28:24.078
I'm a righty in real life.

28:24.120 --> 28:27.206
I'm sorry that I fucked
with your important work.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.334
And with your life,

28:30.376 --> 28:34.380
which is also probably important
to you.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.676
But I'm obligated, in instances,

28:38.717 --> 28:41.345
to effect action

28:41.387 --> 28:45.182
central to the completion
of a specific and critical task

28:45.224 --> 28:48.436
without regard
for ancillary repercussions,

28:48.477 --> 28:52.481
which-- I'm sorry, Leslie--

28:52.523 --> 28:54.567
has meant,

28:54.608 --> 28:56.777
over this period we shared,

28:56.819 --> 28:59.238
you.

29:06.120 --> 29:09.498
I'm a goddamn mess, son.

29:09.540 --> 29:12.751
And it's largely due to you.

29:34.398 --> 29:35.858
Hey, guy.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.027
Good evening.

29:38.068 --> 29:40.112
LESLIE:
Evening.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.449
You have, um...

29:43.491 --> 29:45.242
Your nose, sir.

29:45.284 --> 29:48.287
Thanks.

29:48.329 --> 29:50.289
I, uh...

29:50.331 --> 29:52.750
let it rip this week.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.585
Really,

29:54.627 --> 29:56.504
you know...

29:56.545 --> 30:00.424
really fucking let it rip.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.801
You get it, yeah.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.845
(chuckles)

30:11.143 --> 30:13.354
John?

30:22.947 --> 30:24.823
Can we, uh...

30:24.865 --> 30:27.076
Can we do that lefty?

30:34.792 --> 30:36.752
(indistinct conversations)

30:36.794 --> 30:38.671
JOHN:
Fuck.

30:38.712 --> 30:40.714
TOM:
What?

30:40.756 --> 30:42.633
JOHN:
I have to tell you something.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.009
You...

30:44.051 --> 30:45.511
You're gonna be mad at me.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.721
Tell me what?

30:47.763 --> 30:49.974
John.

30:50.015 --> 30:53.227
JOHN:
I've been fingerprinted before.

30:53.269 --> 30:54.812
TOM:
What?

30:54.853 --> 30:57.856
JOHN:
I... Before.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.484
I was...

31:00.526 --> 31:01.986
TOM:
What?

31:02.027 --> 31:04.071
JOHN:
I was 14.

31:04.113 --> 31:06.657
But, you know,
same fingers as now,

31:06.699 --> 31:09.410
so I have to tell you.

31:09.451 --> 31:11.203
My finger's back there.

31:11.245 --> 31:13.372
Back where?

31:13.414 --> 31:15.291
Back where it got shot off,

31:15.332 --> 31:18.961
at the...
at the little grocery thing.

31:19.003 --> 31:20.713
When were you fingerprinted?

31:20.754 --> 31:22.214
In Denton.

31:22.256 --> 31:25.551
For buying beer
and driving your Mustang.

31:25.593 --> 31:27.636
-At 14?
-Yeah.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.805
Christ, son.

31:29.847 --> 31:32.057
Something could have happened
to that car.

31:32.099 --> 31:34.393
-I know.
-It was cherry.

31:34.435 --> 31:38.147
I know.
That's why I didn't tell you.

31:38.188 --> 31:42.318
You know, I send you
all over the goddamn planet

31:42.359 --> 31:45.446
with the understanding
that things you touch

31:45.487 --> 31:49.742
while operating in many
gray areas of the law, son--

31:49.783 --> 31:51.535
many goddamned gray areas--

31:51.577 --> 31:55.080
cannot be traced back to you,
my son.

31:55.122 --> 31:58.542
Now I learn that they can.

32:00.044 --> 32:02.004
You people have to tell me
this stuff.

32:02.046 --> 32:04.131
Yeah, well,
you just really liked that car.

32:04.173 --> 32:06.800
-Well, it was cherry.
-I know.

32:06.842 --> 32:09.428
You always say that. It's...

32:09.470 --> 32:11.096
it's kind of gross.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.556
-Gross?
-Yeah.

32:12.598 --> 32:13.724
-Why?
-I don't know.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.559
It just is, though.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.979
TOM (exhales deeply):
Fuck.

32:19.021 --> 32:21.565
We can't do this.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.485
-This what?
-Cantar Walley.

32:24.526 --> 32:27.738
If they can put you here
at this time as John Tavner...

32:27.780 --> 32:29.948
an employee of ours...

32:29.990 --> 32:31.325
They can put you here
at the same time,

32:31.367 --> 32:33.369
we can't do this. Fuck.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.499
JOHN:
Let's go get it back.

32:38.540 --> 32:41.669
-What?
-My finger.

32:47.716 --> 32:49.802
I'm sorry.

32:49.843 --> 32:52.262
I fucked up.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.306
I did.

32:57.935 --> 33:01.146
You have to get up now.

33:01.188 --> 33:04.441
We have to leave here
before there are more questions.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.528
Home?

33:07.569 --> 33:10.698
No, we're leaving the hospital.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.449
I have to, uh...

33:12.491 --> 33:15.411
remain on this task for a time.

33:15.452 --> 33:18.414
The other side is still here.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.333
How do you know?

33:21.375 --> 33:24.211
Look at you.

33:24.253 --> 33:28.173
They are intent to gain back
what they gave to us.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.928
(whispering):
I have to find the young man

33:32.970 --> 33:35.806
who gave Mikham the money
weeks ago...

33:35.848 --> 33:38.934
son...

33:38.976 --> 33:41.854
and kill him.

33:41.895 --> 33:44.231
Lakeman.

33:44.273 --> 33:47.276
The police mentioned
the name Lakeman.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.924
It's gonna be cool, man.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.092
Carol's here.

34:12.134 --> 34:13.343
-So what?
-(door closes)

34:13.385 --> 34:15.095
So she can put your fingers
back on.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.305
CAROL:
Edward?

34:16.346 --> 34:18.515
We're in here.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.392
(chuckles) Hey. Welcome.

34:20.434 --> 34:22.144
I still can't tell
which ones are mine.

34:22.186 --> 34:23.854
What's going on?

34:23.896 --> 34:25.898
Efram, go unpack.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.486
Thank God you're here,
as a veterinarian.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.362
-As a what?
-As a veterinarian.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.782
-Why?
-'Cause you can put his fingers
back on.

34:34.823 --> 34:37.493
-I can do what?
-You can put Dennis's fingers
back on.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.411
He had his fingers shot off,
and he can't go to the hospital.

34:39.453 --> 34:41.789
-W-What?
-I can't say, honey.

34:41.830 --> 34:44.166
Work. My dad.
I'm not at liberty to...

34:44.208 --> 34:46.627
But we both got shot.
I took a shoulder graze.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.170
So we're glad that you're here

34:48.212 --> 34:50.464
to put his fingers back on
as a veterinarian,

34:50.506 --> 34:52.341
as that is commonly seen
in feature films.

34:52.382 --> 34:53.675
What is?

34:53.717 --> 34:55.177
When guys can't go
to the hospital,

34:55.219 --> 34:56.929
a disgraced veterinarian
operates on them.

34:56.970 --> 34:59.473
-I'm not disgraced.
-I am.

34:59.515 --> 35:02.100
-Maybe I could help you or...
-Th-That part's not important.

35:02.142 --> 35:03.310
The important part is that

35:03.352 --> 35:05.145
because you almost work
on humans,

35:05.187 --> 35:06.855
you can then work on humans

35:06.897 --> 35:08.774
and it's not a big deal
and you can just do it.

35:08.816 --> 35:10.901
I cannot. Edward,
animals don't have fingers.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.319
-Apes, we were saying.
-Apes?

35:12.361 --> 35:14.321
What the fuck?
I don't operate on apes.

35:14.363 --> 35:16.031
I've never seen a fucking ape.

35:16.073 --> 35:17.574
-Okay, Efram's here, geez.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

35:17.616 --> 35:18.992
You're just...
You're telling me you got shot.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.244
I don't know what's going on.
You're...

35:20.285 --> 35:21.495
I thought we were taking
a few days off.

35:21.537 --> 35:22.913
Um, how long do I have?

35:22.955 --> 35:25.541
To have these back on?
Before they die?

35:25.582 --> 35:27.543
Like, three hours, probably.

35:27.584 --> 35:30.671
(exhales) Like, from now?

35:30.712 --> 35:32.130
Or from when I was shot?

35:32.172 --> 35:34.341
You need to go to the hospital
immediately.

35:34.383 --> 35:35.968
I did that once.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.136
-It fucked everything up.
-Who are you?

35:38.178 --> 35:39.888
Jack Birdbath.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.181
Of course.

35:41.223 --> 35:42.641
Can you try?

35:42.683 --> 35:45.310
It's already been,
like, 20 minutes.

35:47.271 --> 35:49.231
I already lost my wife,
and I'm 42,

35:49.273 --> 35:51.275
so it's already creepy.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.528
And this, I mean...

35:54.570 --> 35:56.572
Can you try?

36:05.330 --> 36:07.416
John.

36:07.457 --> 36:10.168
Yeah?

36:10.210 --> 36:12.546
I don't know.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.590
What?

36:16.550 --> 36:19.678
Never been in the field before.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.305
It's not the field.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.891
It's a 7-Eleven.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.101
Y-Yeah.

36:26.143 --> 36:29.313
I don't know. I...

36:29.354 --> 36:32.733
I feel unusually nervous.

36:34.943 --> 36:38.322
You ever bought
a pack of cigarettes before?

36:38.363 --> 36:41.533
Yeah, I used to smoke
before you were born.

36:41.575 --> 36:44.745
Your mom made me stop.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.956
You're just buying
a pack of cigarettes.

36:47.998 --> 36:50.250
Okay.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.671
You just walk in there
up to the counter,

36:54.713 --> 36:57.090
and I'll come in behind you.

36:57.132 --> 36:59.259
Yeah.

36:59.301 --> 37:02.262
I don't know. I feel...

37:02.304 --> 37:05.098
unusually nervous
to play a role here.

37:07.309 --> 37:10.354
How do you feel?

37:10.395 --> 37:12.981
My hand hurts.

37:13.023 --> 37:16.109
No, I mean, besides that.

37:16.151 --> 37:19.112
Pretty good.

37:19.154 --> 37:21.281
Okay.

37:25.035 --> 37:26.954
I don't.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.041
Hey, you got to get in front.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.629
Why?

37:35.671 --> 37:39.341
Because you have to go in first.
