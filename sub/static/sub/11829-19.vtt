Previously on
The Secret Life of the American Teenager

00:02.535 --> 00:04.400
You're in love again. Who is it this time?

00:04.435 --> 00:06.400
I had my heart set
on Amy and our baby.

00:06.435 --> 00:07.500
Where are you going
in that getup?

00:07.535 --> 00:09.300
That's what you call this?
A getup?

00:09.500 --> 00:11.200
Job interview? Must be
a case of the nerves,

00:11.235 --> 00:12.300
so it is a job interview.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.200
I think we go to the same
school, my name's Thomas.

00:15.235 --> 00:18.100
I can get away with anything
because my sister's pregnant.

00:18.135 --> 00:19.700
My parent's gave me
birth control pills.

00:19.735 --> 00:21.100
Your parents let you
go on the pill?

00:21.135 --> 00:22.800
I'm not on it,
I just have them.

00:22.835 --> 00:24.400
How can I be
what's best for the baby?

00:24.435 --> 00:26.800
Because you'ust's best
for the baby's mother.

00:26.900 --> 00:29.600
I asked you out,
you said, "Yes."

00:29.635 --> 00:30.600
And I wanna go out.

00:30.700 --> 00:33.800
I want you to be careful
not to hurt my sister.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.300
She's all I got.

00:35.335 --> 00:38.200
My foster mother, Margaret,
she's their social worker.

00:38.235 --> 00:40.700
They took me in when I don't
think anyone else would have.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.200
Everyone's afraid of older boys.

00:42.235 --> 00:45.500
Especially with troubled pasts
and crazy drug-addict parents.

00:45.535 --> 00:48.000
You know what? I'm not crazy
about an open adoption.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.500
I want our foster kids back.

00:49.535 --> 00:52.300
I don't think that Ricky's ever
gonna let us adopt that baby either.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.200
I have no intention
of sharing you with Ricky.

00:55.235 --> 00:57.000
Soo who do you love, Amy?

01:09.100 --> 01:12.800
Oh, boy. Mama's got on her
power suit again.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.500
Just because you have
a pregnant teenage daughter

01:14.535 --> 01:17.600
doesn't mean you can
be a governor, my lady.

01:17.635 --> 01:18.600
Give it up, George.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.600
I am going to get a job,
and when I get a job,

01:20.635 --> 01:22.100
I'm gonna proceed
with the divorce,

01:22.135 --> 01:23.600
and you are going to be moving.

01:23.635 --> 01:25.300
Well, I hope
it's a really big job,

01:25.335 --> 01:27.000
because I wanna get
a really big house.

01:27.035 --> 01:29.600
Ooh, the sweet smell of alimony.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.500
- Hello?
- Hi.

01:34.535 --> 01:36.500
Is Ashley there, please?

01:36.535 --> 01:37.600
May I ask who's calling?

01:37.635 --> 01:39.000
- Don't do that.
- Shh!

01:39.035 --> 01:40.600
- Thomas.
- Thomas?

01:40.635 --> 01:42.300
Okay, let me see
if I can find her.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.700
Thomas?

01:43.735 --> 01:46.200
Ashley! There's someone
on the phone for you!

01:46.235 --> 01:49.600
- She can't hear that.
- Ashley, phone!

01:50.300 --> 01:52.200
I'm sorry Thomas, but can
I have her call you back?

01:52.235 --> 01:55.000
- Yes, thank you.
- Does she have your number?

01:55.035 --> 01:56.900
I believe she does.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.400
I told you, I can't away
with anything right now.

02:01.435 --> 02:02.700
The closer it gets
to the baby's arrival,

02:02.735 --> 02:04.100
the more invisible I get.

02:04.135 --> 02:06.300
And is that your doing
or your family's?

02:06.335 --> 02:09.400
- Your invisibility?
- Mine.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.400
Ashley left a half hour ago.
She took the bus.

02:13.435 --> 02:15.000
No one told me.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.300
No one tells me anything
around here anymore.

02:17.335 --> 02:19.000
It's lonely at the top,
governor.

02:19.035 --> 02:21.100
That's your oldest
daughter, Amy.

02:21.135 --> 02:23.700
She's here, and she needs
a ride to school.

02:26.700 --> 02:29.800
So, Amy, it's back to
looking for a job, huh?

02:29.835 --> 02:31.400
Are you talking about you or me?

02:31.435 --> 02:32.300
Both of us.

02:32.335 --> 02:34.800
If you don't have a family to
adopt the baby, you need to get a job,

02:34.835 --> 02:36.500
and without your father,
I need to get a job too.

02:36.535 --> 02:38.500
You know, I think we
could get some help.

02:38.900 --> 02:39.700
Help?

02:39.735 --> 02:41.300
Yeah, u know,
from the government?

02:41.335 --> 02:43.000
Amy, don't be ridiculous.

02:43.035 --> 02:44.300
You don't need to get help
from the government.

02:44.335 --> 02:46.400
- We can take care of ourselves.
- Mom.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.200
We can both get a job
if we try.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.900
I've been trying,
but I can try a little harder.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.700
And Amy, you can
try harder too.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.000
Honestly, Mom, I don't think
I can get a job,

02:55.035 --> 02:57.200
and I'm not so sure
you could either.

02:57.235 --> 02:59.000
Well, I'm sure that we can.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.900
We just need to keep looking.

03:00.935 --> 03:03.800
And while we're looking, we can look for
another couple to adopt the baby.

03:03.835 --> 03:06.100
There are plenty of couples out there
who are looking to adopt,

03:06.200 --> 03:07.600
it's just a matter of finding
the right one.

03:07.635 --> 03:10.100
Mom, I don't think I chithrough that again

03:10.200 --> 03:12.400
I can't believe
Donovan andWell,

03:12.435 --> 03:13.700
Well they did't.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.300
That's how it is.

03:15.335 --> 03:16.700
Well, maybe they'll change
their minds.

03:16.735 --> 03:18.700
Yeah, and maybe I'll be governor,
but in the meantime,

03:18.735 --> 03:20.000
we need to find work.

03:20.035 --> 03:21.400
It's not gonna happen.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.700
I'm not qualified
to do anything,

03:22.735 --> 03:25.400
and I don't know what you're
qualified to do.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.900
Well, I don't know either,
but there's gotta be something.

03:28.935 --> 03:31.500
We just have to be willing
to take any job.

03:31.535 --> 03:33.800
Any honest job that we can get,

03:33.835 --> 03:35.900
because you know it's always
easier to get a job

03:35.935 --> 03:37.100
when you already have a job.

03:37.135 --> 03:38.900
So we'll just take the
first one that comes along

03:38.935 --> 03:39.800
and we'll go from there.

03:39.835 --> 03:41.800
Mom,I don't want a job.

03:41.835 --> 03:45.300
Amy, Woman up, okay?
Come on, let's go.

03:45.335 --> 03:47.200
Let's get out there,
let's do the right thing.

03:47.235 --> 03:48.800
Let's be responsible.

03:48.835 --> 03:51.600
Mom, I'm tired.

03:51.635 --> 03:55.200
And I have school,
I don't want to be responsible.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.600
Did I mention that I'm tired?

03:58.300 --> 04:00.600
I had a short stint
as a cocktail waitress.

04:00.635 --> 04:03.400
Made pretty good money but
I got busted on the age thing.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.639
Exactly how old are you, Ashley?

04:05.674 --> 04:06.701
Seventeen.

04:06.900 --> 04:09.700
You're in middle school,
so you're not 17.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.200
Unless you're really, really
stupid, and you're not stupid.

04:12.235 --> 04:14.200
I thought you said you went to my school.

04:14.235 --> 04:17.399
No, I saw you get off
the bus at your school.

04:17.435 --> 04:18.700
I lied.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.500
Now's the time you're supposed
to stop staring at me

04:24.535 --> 04:27.300
because my staring at you
bothers you.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.900
I'm not in middle school, baby.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.700
And I'm fascinated by your lips.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.100
Heh. You're an idiot.

04:33.135 --> 04:34.800
Yeah maybe.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.900
I'm home schooled, and my parents
are very good teachers.

04:37.935 --> 04:39.500
Well, you lucky guy.

04:39.535 --> 04:40.800
How did you get that?

04:40.900 --> 04:42.400
I don't get along well
with others.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.600
Me neither.

04:43.635 --> 04:45.800
I know, I saw you on the bus.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.200
So I'm just gonna
cut to the chase.

04:49.235 --> 04:51.100
Can I come over
to your house tonight?

04:51.400 --> 04:52.700
I don't know.

04:52.735 --> 04:54.700
- How old are you?
- Uh, 15.

04:54.735 --> 04:57.600
I'll think about it.
Give me your number.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.200
Got to be something here
I have more pens.

05:17.835 --> 05:19.300
Although I didn't
finish college,

05:19.335 --> 05:24.200
when i drop out at a 3.8 average
in business management.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.900
And let's face it, as a mom of 16 years,
I have tons of experience

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
in handling money and working
on a budget and time management.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.800
Time management,
that's a big one.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.200
I'm really good at that.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.000
And, uh,
I'm also a multitasker.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.700
Do you speak Spanish?

05:41.735 --> 05:43.100
I speak French.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.600
And a little Greek.

05:46.635 --> 05:47.800
No Spanish?

05:47.801 --> 05:48.801
Un poquito.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.200
- So no Spainish.
- Si.

05:50.235 --> 05:53.100
- The cook only speaks Spanish.
- I'll learn Spanish.

05:53.135 --> 05:56.400
I love hot dogs, I love working???

05:57.400 --> 05:58.500
I really want this job.

05:58.600 --> 06:03.098
You, with the 3.8 and the suit,
you want this job?

06:03.133 --> 06:05.000
Yeah, I really want this job.

06:05.035 --> 06:06.600
I've been looking
for quite a while now

06:06.635 --> 06:09.700
and it seems that
no one sees my potential.

06:09.735 --> 06:10.900
Oh, I see your potential.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.300
I plan on going back to school,
but with this economy

06:13.335 --> 06:14.900
it's really hard to find
part-time work.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
So I figure this could
a place as any to start.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.600
I'll work really hard, and I'm
totally flexible with my hours.

06:20.635 --> 06:22.600
Flexible, huh?

06:23.200 --> 06:24.300
Husband leave you?

06:24.335 --> 06:25.200
I wish.

06:25.235 --> 06:26.300
But we are getting a divorce,

06:26.335 --> 06:29.300
so I'm reentering
the work force, so to speak.

06:29.335 --> 06:31.600
- It's not easy.
- Not if you don't speak Spanish.

06:31.635 --> 06:34.600
And hey, this is not the work force.

06:34.635 --> 06:36.200
We feed the work force.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.500
-How old are you?
-You can't ask me that.

06:38.535 --> 06:41.500
You brought up the personal stuff,
divorce and all that

06:41.535 --> 06:44.100
How old are you is not
a job-intew question,

06:44.135 --> 06:46.000
it's a personal question,

06:46.035 --> 06:48.700
me to you, man to woman.

06:48.735 --> 06:49.700
Then I'm 29.

06:49.735 --> 06:51.700
I've been out with women
over 29.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.100
- Natural redhead?
- What?

06:54.135 --> 06:55.600
Your hair?
Put something on it?

06:55.700 --> 06:56.600
No.

06:56.635 --> 07:00.000
All right then, you're hired.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.900
I like women who don't
have a problem with lying.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.900
These, uh--

07:04.935 --> 07:08.000
These aren't all-beef
hot dogs, you know?

07:08.035 --> 07:09.900
I'll need an assistant.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.300
An assistant.You know
someone who speaks spanish.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.100
No, you don't need an assistant

07:14.200 --> 07:16.700
You just serve the dogs,
it's not that tough

07:16.800 --> 07:19.600
I'm pretty sure if I call
the labor relations department

07:19.635 --> 07:21.700
and tell them about this little
job interview

07:21.735 --> 07:23.800
you could lose your
business license.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.100
That's hot.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.600
Say it again.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.800
You could lose your
business license.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
You could.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.500
Okay, it's not your mother,
is it?

07:33.535 --> 07:34.700
No, it's my daughter.

07:34.735 --> 07:36.500
Daughter, huh?

07:36.535 --> 07:37.900
Sold.

07:37.935 --> 07:40.200
Yeah, minimum wage
for the both of yous.

07:40.235 --> 07:41.400
Cool.

07:41.435 --> 07:43.500
And don't tell the cook.

07:43.535 --> 07:46.100
He thinks he's in training
for another job at the mall.

07:46.135 --> 07:48.600
Gotta go. I got other
Hot Dog Huts, babe.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.900
But believe me,
I'll be checkin' in on you,

07:51.000 --> 07:52.100
if you know what I mean.

07:52.135 --> 07:53.700

Hello, miss.

Oh, hey, Amy.

08:30.700 --> 08:31.500
Hi, Jack.

08:31.535 --> 08:33.100
You look like you could use
some perking up.

08:33.135 --> 08:34.900
-Would you like a chocolate bar?
-Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.600
All right,
we got plain, caramel,

08:36.635 --> 08:38.500
nougat, dark chocolate,
milk chocolate--

08:38.600 --> 08:40.100
Wait,
you're selling candy bars?

08:40.200 --> 08:41.600
Yeah, The kid I'm mentoring, Duncan,

08:41.635 --> 08:43.500
he's selling candy bars for
disadvantaged youth.

08:43.534 --> 08:45.400
- Isn't he disadvantaged?
- Yeah.

08:45.435 --> 08:48.500
I guess That's why he's raising money
for disadvantaged kids.

08:48.535 --> 08:49.400
Have a heart.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.100
Or better yet,
have a fudge supreme.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.700
- How much?
- Five bucks.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.900
For a candy bar that I can get
for a buck 50 in the grocery store?

08:55.935 --> 08:57.600
It's for the youth.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.400
Ben?

09:01.600 --> 09:03.800
I'm at theCRhe stairs
by the water machine.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.500
Where are you?
I need something

09:05.535 --> 09:07.100
Oh, I'm right here.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.700
Hey,J

09:09.735 --> 09:12.300
- I need $5.
- Oh, sure.

09:12.335 --> 09:14.400
- Jack's selling candy bars.y
- You want one too?

09:14.435 --> 09:16.700
For 5 bucks?
That's a little steep.

09:16.735 --> 09:17.700
It's disadvantage youth.

09:17.735 --> 09:19.200
The kid I'm mentoring
is selling them.

09:19.235 --> 09:20.100
You're selling them.

09:20.135 --> 09:21.600
So how is he
Learning anything?

09:21.635 --> 09:23.700
He's learning that
he can rely on me for help.

09:23.735 --> 09:26.100
In that case
I'll take four.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.500
Thanks.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.200
Here you go.

09:31.235 --> 09:33.100
And, hey, when the band's
selling wrapping paper,

09:33.135 --> 09:34.100
I'll help you out.

09:34.135 --> 09:35.000
Oh, that's over.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.700
Next year then. Thank you.

09:37.735 --> 09:39.800
You know,
why can't I do that?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.500
What? Sell candy bars?

09:41.535 --> 09:45.000
No, get money from someone
who's selling candy bars.

09:45.035 --> 09:47.200
Is your mom on you
about getting a job again?

09:47.400 --> 09:48.500
Yeah.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.300
Maybe you should just make the
effort to apply for some jobs.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.800
That you're willing to do whatever it
takes to take care of the baby.

09:55.835 --> 09:58.200
just like she's getting a job to help
take care of you and Ashley.

09:58.235 --> 09:59.500
You know what would
be supportive?

09:59.535 --> 10:01.800
If you said, "You shouldn't
have to work, Amy.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.700
you've already been through enough,
your mom and dad should take care of you."

10:04.735 --> 10:06.300
They are taking care of you.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.700
They're just trying to show you what
it's like to take care of the baby.

10:08.735 --> 10:09.600
And you can do it.

10:09.635 --> 10:11.200
I know I can do it.

10:11.300 --> 10:12.900
I don't want to do it.

10:12.935 --> 10:15.100
I'm having a baby,
I don't wanna get a job.

10:15.135 --> 10:17.000
Well, what do you
want to do, Amy?

10:17.035 --> 10:20.000
Do you want to find
another couple to adopt the baby?

10:20.600 --> 10:22.500
You should date my mother.

10:26.500 --> 10:30.400
That would have been
so much more oown gotten up on my own.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.400
See you.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.700
So you two made up, huh?

10:36.735 --> 10:37.900
Did Amy tell you that?

10:37.935 --> 10:39.900
Oh, let's not be
so insecure, rich boy.

10:39.935 --> 10:41.800
At least not so
obviously insecure.

10:41.835 --> 10:43.700
I don't have anything
to be insecure about.

10:43.735 --> 10:46.000
When the time is right
I'm legally gonna marry Amy

10:46.035 --> 10:48.100
and spend rest of my life
with her on her side.

10:48.135 --> 10:50.100
Or if you find another couple
to a the baby

10:50.135 --> 10:53.300
Then I'm going to spend the rest
of my life with Amy and visit your son.

10:53.335 --> 10:54.800
So which one will after, Ricky?

10:54.835 --> 10:55.900
Amy or the baby?

10:55.935 --> 10:58.400
Both.

11:03.400 --> 11:07.100
Grace, that I know when women go
on the pill, they crave chocolate.

11:07.135 --> 11:10.600
I'm not on the pill, I have the
pill, but i'm not on it.

11:10.635 --> 11:13.700
And how do you suddenly know
so much about birth control pills, Jack

11:13.735 --> 11:15.800
I don't, really, I'm just
trying to make a sales pitch

11:15.835 --> 11:17.600
I'm helping Duncan sell candy bars.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.000
You're raising money for Duncan?

11:19.035 --> 11:21.300
No, he's raising money
for disadvantaged youth.

11:21.335 --> 11:25.400
Oh, that's so nice.
Especially since he's disadvantaged.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.400
- How much are they?
- Five dollars.

11:27.435 --> 11:28.900
Ha. For one?

11:28.935 --> 11:33.700
Jack, I can't pay $5 for a candy bar,
even it is for disadvantaged youth.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
But I can help you sell them.
I'm kinda popular right now.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.200
And besides, that's what
Christians do, right?

11:39.235 --> 11:40.600
They help each other
when they need help.

11:40.635 --> 11:42.700
Yeah, okay.
I'll take you up on that offer.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.200
Thanks, Grace.

11:44.235 --> 11:47.300
No, no, no, I can do it.

11:47.335 --> 11:49.100
Okay. Now, by "it,"

11:49.135 --> 11:51.700
I hope you mean sell candy bars.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.600
Hey, girlfriend.

11:57.635 --> 11:59.000
Oh. Hi, Grace.

11:59.035 --> 12:00.100
What's that?

12:00.135 --> 12:03.200
This is an opportunity to help
the disadvantaged youth.

12:03.235 --> 12:05.700
Oh, jeez. That's not those
giant candy bars, is it?

12:05.735 --> 12:08.600
I'm selling those for the majorettes
to go to Washington D.C. next year.

12:08.635 --> 12:10.400
Well, I'm selling them for kids
who can't even dream

12:10.435 --> 12:12.400
of going to Washington D.C.

12:12.435 --> 12:14.300
Oh, you're good.

12:14.335 --> 12:15.600
But no thanks.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.000
How much you selling them for anyway?

12:17.035 --> 12:19.100
Five dollars.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.800
We're selling ours for 2.50.

12:20.835 --> 12:24.500
You're majorettes.
These are disadvantaged youth.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.200
Who can't even dream of being
majorettes. Yeah, yeah.

12:27.235 --> 12:28.900
I'm still not paying you
5 bucks for a candy bar.

12:28.935 --> 12:30.700
Okay, 2.50 for half?

12:30.735 --> 12:31.600
Nope.

12:31.635 --> 12:32.800
Do you wanna help me sell them?

12:32.835 --> 12:35.100
No, I'm not even trying to sell mine.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.400
I need you to do something for me.

12:40.435 --> 12:43.400
Do you think I could fit into that
pink cashmere sweater that you have?

12:43.435 --> 12:45.300
Sure. You wanna borrow my sweater?

12:45.335 --> 12:47.400
Yeah, if you don't mind.

12:47.435 --> 12:48.700
No.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.700
I'm trying to get my brother
to have sex with me

12:50.735 --> 12:54.100
and I thought I'd have a better
shot if I looked more innocent.

12:54.135 --> 12:57.700
He's trying to court me, and, well,
I don't have any courting clothes.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.700
That's good he's trying to court you.

12:59.735 --> 13:02.100
That'll give you a chance
to act like a lady.

13:02.135 --> 13:04.700
You know, ladies have sex.

13:04.735 --> 13:06.700
No, not until they're married.

13:06.735 --> 13:10.000
That wouldn't be a lady,
that would be a...

13:10.035 --> 13:12.600
Me?

13:12.800 --> 13:15.200
Oh, oh, Adrian,
I have such a good idea.

13:15.235 --> 13:17.100
You should become a virgin again.

13:17.135 --> 13:18.400
- A what?
- Yeah.

13:18.435 --> 13:20.500
You know, set the
odometer back to zero.

13:20.535 --> 13:24.600
Ha. Okay, one, no you can't.
And two, I'm not a car,

13:24.700 --> 13:27.800
and I don't like car analogies
or jokes made about riding me

13:27.835 --> 13:29.100
or riding on me or--

13:29.135 --> 13:31.400
Adrian! You're a lady now.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.200
And I would never
say those things about you.

13:33.235 --> 13:37.300
You're my friend, and
you could be my new virgin friend.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.100
Imagine how much your brother
would like that,

13:40.135 --> 13:42.700
you reclaiming your virginity.

13:42.735 --> 13:43.700
And, you know, while you're at it,

13:43.735 --> 13:45.900
you could tone down
the lip gloss a little bit.

13:45.935 --> 13:48.200
Okay, watch how attracted
guys are to the idea

13:48.235 --> 13:51.000
of having sex with a virgin.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.600
Does anybody want to help me out  and
buy a candy bar for the disadvantaged youth?

13:54.635 --> 13:55.300
Oh, yeah.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.800
- I do.
- I do.

13:56.835 --> 14:00.200
Awesome. Five dollars.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.200
Thank you. Thank you.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.800
Thanks, boys.

14:06.835 --> 14:08.600
Oh, thanks.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.400
Oh, thank you.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.700
Bye.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.800
Hey, so, uh, who's your
second choice if you don't get Amy,

14:20.835 --> 14:22.200
and/or the baby?

14:22.235 --> 14:24.000
I know you're used
to getting what you want.

14:24.035 --> 14:25.400
Let's just say
this time you don't?

14:25.435 --> 14:27.800
Who are you gonna go after? Adrian?

14:27.835 --> 14:30.800
Oh, that's right, Adrian's in
love with her brother right now.

14:30.835 --> 14:33.500
So what about Grace?
Grace isn't gonna marry you.

14:33.535 --> 14:36.600
She's probably gonna become a doctor,
she'll probably marry a doctor.

14:36.635 --> 14:40.900
She's a doctor's daughter, so a little
out of your league, don't you think?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.700
Oh, and by the way, if you and Amy
don't find a couple to adopt the baby,

14:44.735 --> 14:47.400
you're gonna be paying child
support for the next 18 years.

14:47.435 --> 14:48.400
How are you gonna do that?

14:48.435 --> 14:50.400
You don't just get
to call yourself the daddy

14:50.435 --> 14:53.700
without being financially
responsible for the child.

14:53.735 --> 14:56.900
Think about that. Child support
every month for the next 18 years.

14:56.935 --> 14:59.400
So if you're just using
the baby as a way to get to Amy,

14:59.435 --> 15:01.800
just keep in mind that
it's gonna cost you.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.500
But you know that, right?

15:05.700 --> 15:10.100
You shouldn't take things
that you can't pay for, Ricky.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.400
It wasn't Ricky.

15:28.435 --> 15:29.600
Then who was it?

15:29.635 --> 15:33.300
George, I'm sorry if we disappointed
you and Anne and Amy, but--

15:33.335 --> 15:35.400
Who said you disappointed me?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.600
I just wanna know what happened.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.400
When we were gonna give the baby
away then I was happy u r gonna take it

15:40.435 --> 15:42.900
but if you're not gonna take him,
we're not gonna give the baby away.

15:42.935 --> 15:44.600
George, that is so sweet.

15:44.635 --> 15:45.300
No, I mean it.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.200
It's late in the game.

15:46.235 --> 15:49.600
It's too late to get to know anyone well
to know if they should be parenting my grandson.

15:49.635 --> 15:51.900
So who was it?
It wasn't Ricky?

15:51.935 --> 15:52.800
Well...

15:52.835 --> 15:53.600
I knew it.

15:53.635 --> 15:55.600
It wasn't Ricky exactly.

15:55.635 --> 15:58.800
It's all the Rickys
who need parents.

15:59.300 --> 16:03.500
These children present challenges,
but what children don't?

16:04.200 --> 16:05.800
We still want them.

16:05.835 --> 16:06.800
Why?

16:06.835 --> 16:08.400
Why are you taking on
someone else's problems

16:08.435 --> 16:10.000
when you won't take on ours?

16:10.035 --> 16:14.300
George, this is kind of
difficult to explain to you.

16:14.900 --> 16:17.700
It's all about acceptance.

16:18.500 --> 16:22.400
Loving the imperfect
makes us accept and love

16:22.435 --> 16:25.100
our own imperfections.

16:25.900 --> 16:28.300
Damn. You made me cry.

16:31.100 --> 16:36.300
You know, Anne is imperfect,
and I love her, I--

16:37.500 --> 16:39.900
This divorce is killing me.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.000
Did you get the house?

16:42.035 --> 16:44.600
I'm still waiting on the loan.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.300
I should not have eaten
those four candy bars.

16:48.335 --> 16:49.600
You'll be fine.

16:49.635 --> 16:53.000
Yeah, I just need to go home
and take a nap.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.900
Oh, hey, there you are.

16:54.935 --> 16:57.400
What are you doing inside
the school and not outside?

16:57.435 --> 16:58.100
Hi, Ben.

16:58.135 --> 16:59.800
Hi, Ms. Juergens. How are you?

16:59.835 --> 17:01.100
I'm terrific.

17:01.135 --> 17:02.700
I got a job today.

17:02.735 --> 17:03.700
You're kidding me?

17:03.735 --> 17:06.200
No, I'm not kidding you.
And they like me so much

17:06.234 --> 17:08.099
that they're letting me
have an assistant.

17:08.135 --> 17:09.500
You speak Spanish, right?

17:09.535 --> 17:10.200
Right.

17:10.234 --> 17:11.300
Okay, well, we better go.

17:11.335 --> 17:12.400
Because we start at 3:30.

17:12.435 --> 17:13.700
We start what at 3:30?

17:13.734 --> 17:15.900
Our job. Come on let's go,
I'll tell you about it in the car.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.800
Mom, I've had a really long day.

17:17.835 --> 17:21.599
I just ate four $5 chocolate bars,
and I don't feel too well.

17:21.635 --> 17:23.000
Maybe we could start tomorrow.

17:23.035 --> 17:24.700
Twenty dollars worth of chocolate?

17:24.734 --> 17:26.800
You're gonna have to work
at least three hours for that.

17:26.835 --> 17:28.600
Maybe more,
if you factor in taxes.

17:28.635 --> 17:31.600
Why do I get the feeling that
this is not the job that I want?

17:31.635 --> 17:34.100
It's a job that pays.
That's what you want, right?

17:34.135 --> 17:37.700
And it's a start.
Plus, we'll be working together.

17:37.735 --> 17:38.700
Won't that be fun?

17:38.735 --> 17:40.800
Hm, what will be fun?

17:40.835 --> 17:42.300
Come on.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.200
See you, Ben.

17:44.235 --> 17:46.600
Uh, bye.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.700
That'll be 2.75.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.200
There you go.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.300
Could I have, uh,
two dimes and a nickel?

17:58.335 --> 18:00.100
Sure.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.600
Those are full of nitrates,
just so you know.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.800
I know,
and I don't care.

18:07.835 --> 18:10.300
Tasty nitrates.

18:10.335 --> 18:12.200
Bon appetit.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.100
What can I get for you?

18:14.135 --> 18:17.300
Couple of hot dogs with mustard,
ketchup and grilled onions.

18:17.335 --> 18:19.400
Two cry babies
with a shot of red and yellow.

18:19.435 --> 18:22.823
[IN SPANISH]

18:22.858 --> 18:25.774

[IN SPANISH]

18:29.287 --> 18:33.841
[IN SPANISH]

18:33.876 --> 18:37.954
[IN SPANISH]

18:37.989 --> 18:40.000
-You have hamburgers?
-No, we have hot dogs.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.600
And soda, and water.
And that's it.

18:41.635 --> 18:43.200
- Oh, and chips.
- What about nachos?

18:43.235 --> 18:45.200
- Nope.
- Kabobs?

18:45.235 --> 18:47.200
I can cut up a hot dog and
put it on a stick for you.

18:47.235 --> 18:48.700
I don't want that,
I want a kabob.

18:48.735 --> 18:50.800
- What kind of place is this?
- American.

18:50.835 --> 18:52.000
Oh, then I'll
have the hamburger.

18:52.035 --> 18:52.900
We don't have hamburgers.

18:52.935 --> 18:54.000
Then you're not American.

18:54.035 --> 18:55.700
Are you sure you don't want
try the hot dogs?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.900
-They're really very tasty.
-All right, all right.

18:57.935 --> 18:59.800
Give me a hot dog. Plain.

18:59.835 --> 19:00.885
One naked dog.

19:01.434 --> 19:05.300
[IN SPANISH]

19:05.335 --> 19:08.300
No, she's just trying
to teach me a lesson.

19:09.300 --> 19:12.800
Oops, did I say
that in English?

19:12.835 --> 19:14.900
Where are my cry babies?

19:15.200 --> 19:16.400
Thank you.

19:16.435 --> 19:18.600
Come on, Amy,
get with it, girl.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.000
If you don't have the job
you want,

19:20.035 --> 19:21.800
you want the job you have.

19:21.835 --> 19:25.000
Hm. Who's got the dogs with onions?

19:25.035 --> 19:25.956
There you go, sir.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.200
She didn't tell you
what kind of job?

19:31.235 --> 19:33.700
She didn't even tell me
she had a job.

19:33.735 --> 19:36.600
You told me when you picked me
up from school, if you recall.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.100
What kind of job could she
and Amy have together?

19:39.135 --> 19:41.100
I'm sure I don't know.

19:41.135 --> 19:44.000
But I guess she has a job,
she can keep the baby, right?

19:44.035 --> 19:45.400
Don't be ridiculous, pumpkin.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.600
We have enough money
for Amy to keep the baby.

19:47.635 --> 19:48.800
I just can't tell
your mother that.

19:48.835 --> 19:50.000
Couldn't you tell Amy?

19:50.035 --> 19:51.700
No, because she'd
tell your mother.

19:51.735 --> 19:53.900
How many times have we told Amy things
and told her not to tell your mother

19:53.935 --> 19:54.900
and then she's told your mother?

19:54.935 --> 19:58.300
So we're better off for her
to have a job she doesn't want,

19:58.335 --> 20:00.700
to pay for a baby
she doesn't want,

20:00.735 --> 20:04.200
that she's having
with a guy she doesn't want?

20:04.235 --> 20:06.100
You got it. That's what we want.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.900
All right. Father knows best.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.800
Hey, can I have
a friend come over?

20:12.835 --> 20:14.000
You can have
whatever you want.

20:14.035 --> 20:16.700
An imaginary friend or is
this the guy with the dead dog?

20:16.735 --> 20:18.400
It's that guy.

20:18.435 --> 20:19.800
Yeah, he looked all right.

20:19.835 --> 20:20.800
I'll be in the garage.

20:20.835 --> 20:22.100
Don't get pregnant.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.800
Unless you want a job
you don't want.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.800
Practice! Practice, people!

20:44.835 --> 20:47.400
That's you, Boykewich.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.300
Pfft. You are not
a percussionist.

20:51.335 --> 20:53.400
Yeah,
I'm not an athlete either,

20:53.435 --> 20:55.600
so I figure I'll just stay here
for the rest of the year

20:55.635 --> 20:56.600
so I don't have to take P.E.

20:56.635 --> 20:58.300
How do you do it?

21:00.700 --> 21:03.300
How do you do something
you're bad at every day?

21:03.335 --> 21:05.000
I've been doing it all my life.

21:05.035 --> 21:06.700
I played tennis.
I'm no good at tennis.

21:06.735 --> 21:10.700
I tried golf, baseball,
basketball, basket weaving.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.200
I'm no good at any of it.

21:12.235 --> 21:14.500
And I can't really dance,
can't really sing.

21:14.535 --> 21:16.000
None of it bothers me.

21:16.100 --> 21:19.300
What bothers me, however,
is your close proximity.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.000
And just know that
if you plan on hitting me,

21:21.035 --> 21:22.600
I'm no good at fighting either.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.400
But I do have money.

21:24.435 --> 21:27.800
Yeah, so you win,
and I lose, I guess.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.300
What?

21:29.800 --> 21:31.500
I just came here to concede.

21:31.535 --> 21:33.200
You were right.
I don't have money

21:33.235 --> 21:35.400
so I probably would not make
the best father for the baby,

21:35.435 --> 21:37.000
or the best husband for Amy.

21:37.035 --> 21:38.400
You know maybe Amy went back with you

21:38.435 --> 21:40.300
because the adoption
fell through.

21:40.335 --> 21:42.200
Maybe she's just looking
for security.

21:42.235 --> 21:43.700
Yeah, or maybe
she just loves me.

21:43.735 --> 21:45.700
Pfft.
She loves your money anyway.

21:45.735 --> 21:48.800
She loves the idea of not having
to worry about our son's future.

21:48.835 --> 21:51.200
So you and Amy
have a nice life with my son.

21:51.235 --> 21:53.300
A nice comfortable life.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.600
You win, Ben.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.800
Thank you for inviting me
into your home today, Grace.

22:07.835 --> 22:10.700
I like to know what's going on
with the young people, with teens.

22:10.735 --> 22:12.300
I'm the father of a teen myself.

22:12.335 --> 22:14.200
I think you both know Jack.

22:14.235 --> 22:18.200
Oh, that's right. You're Jack's dad.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.100
I forgot about that.

22:20.135 --> 22:21.100
He doesn't know anything.

22:21.135 --> 22:22.600
But I'm always
willing to learn.

22:22.635 --> 22:24.600
Is this regarding Jack?

22:24.635 --> 22:25.400
No.

22:25.435 --> 22:27.400
Oh, good, heh.

22:27.435 --> 22:30.700
Made me nervousthere for a second.
So, what is this about?

22:30.735 --> 22:33.000
We need you to restore
her virginity.

22:33.035 --> 22:35.800
- But not because of Jack, right?
- Right.

22:35.835 --> 22:39.800
I've made a few mistakes.
Maybe even more than a few.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.100
Although I don't like to think
of sex as a mistake,

22:43.135 --> 22:46.000
it's just that I
want my virginity back.

22:46.035 --> 22:49.000
Well, let me go out to my car
and I'll wave my magic wand over you

22:49.035 --> 22:51.800
and abracadabra,
you're restored.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.600
Uh, just joking.

22:54.635 --> 22:56.400
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

22:56.435 --> 22:58.700
He's so funny, isn't he?

22:58.735 --> 23:00.500
Yeah. Hysterical.

23:00.535 --> 23:02.900
Well, actually no one has ever
asked me to do this before.

23:02.935 --> 23:07.794
I've never done this so I suppose the
theory is that with God's forgiveness

23:07.794 --> 23:09.000
for what you've done
in the past,

23:09.035 --> 23:11.900
and God forgives everything,
you can always start over.

23:11.935 --> 23:13.100
No matter what you've done.

23:13.135 --> 23:15.800
So, Adrian, if you just ask
for God's forgiveness

23:15.835 --> 23:19.500
for your sexual transgressions,
you have that forgiveness.

23:19.535 --> 23:21.900
You are a virgin again.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.300
Well, spiritually,
not physically, of course.

23:24.335 --> 23:25.300
Of course.

23:25.335 --> 23:27.500
- Are you, uh, Catholic?
- Why?

23:27.535 --> 23:30.000
Well, this is the nature of
the confessional, is it not?

23:30.035 --> 23:32.600
You, each week you confess,

23:32.635 --> 23:34.800
and then you are forgiven
and you start over.

23:34.835 --> 23:36.900
Yeah, if you confess
week to week.

23:36.935 --> 23:40.700
I think this is our opportunity to win
her over to our team, isn't it, reverend?

23:40.735 --> 23:42.200
I don't do that.

23:42.235 --> 23:44.600
I don't steal sheep
from other pastures.

23:44.635 --> 23:47.700
Now, if they wanna
wander over to our land,

23:47.735 --> 23:49.300
I'm happy to shepherd them.

23:49.335 --> 23:53.300
Of course, this is not about our church
doctrine, or your church's doctrine.

23:53.335 --> 23:55.300
This is about you and God,

23:55.335 --> 23:58.300
this is about your life,
this is about your beliefs.

23:58.335 --> 24:02.000
If you wanna be forgiven, and
commit to a life of abstinence and purity,

24:02.035 --> 24:03.300
then do it, Adrian.

24:03.335 --> 24:05.400
But I do think that once you
make a promise to God,

24:05.435 --> 24:07.200
that promise
is a real commitment,

24:07.235 --> 24:09.200
you don't just say it to say it,
you know what I mean?

24:09.235 --> 24:11.000
Yeah. I know what you mean.

24:11.035 --> 24:13.000
So think about it.
And if that's what you want,

24:13.035 --> 24:15.200
ask for God to forgive you.

24:15.300 --> 24:17.400
Whether you do that
by yourself or with my help,

24:17.435 --> 24:18.900
or the help of someone else,

24:18.935 --> 24:22.500
and you are on the way
to a new beginning.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.700
Thank you so much,
Reverend Stone.

24:24.735 --> 24:26.700
I'm just gonna run upstairs
and get my pink sweater.

24:26.735 --> 24:28.800
Mm-hm.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.700
Aren't you the girl
who broke up Jack and Grace?

24:34.400 --> 24:36.500
Not anymore.

25:00.800 --> 25:06.500
Okay, I'm okay...
Okay. All right.

25:07.100 --> 25:10.700
Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.100
Hi, yeah, uh,
I just got mugged.

25:14.135 --> 25:17.400
Uh, I was getting out
of my car and--

25:17.435 --> 25:19.000
No, no, I'm not hurt.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.200
I'm at--

25:21.500 --> 25:23.100
No, no, they didn't
have a gun.

25:23.300 --> 25:26.000
I don't know, it was
my candy bar money.

25:26.035 --> 25:28.400
I don't know, I can't think!
I was just mugged!

25:28.435 --> 25:30.600
Two hundred dollars, about 200--

25:34.400 --> 25:37.400
Hey, that's money for
disadvantaged youth!

25:55.700 --> 25:57.500
You have a urinal
in your garage?

25:57.535 --> 25:59.300
Not to worry, we have
indoor plumbing too.

25:59.335 --> 26:00.700
Come on in.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.600
So that was your dad out there?

26:04.635 --> 26:05.800
He lives out there?

26:05.835 --> 26:09.500
Yep. Sit down.
Make yourself at home.

26:16.900 --> 26:19.200
Oh, so I brought
you something.

26:19.235 --> 26:20.800
Wow.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.700
You're a teenage alcoholic, huh?

26:22.735 --> 26:25.000
No. It's for your parents.

26:25.035 --> 26:27.000
Oh, okay. Thanks.

26:27.035 --> 26:29.900
Red.
No refrigerator, right?

26:30.500 --> 26:33.000
Right.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.900
So aspartame?

26:38.900 --> 26:40.400
I hate small talk.

26:40.435 --> 26:42.000
Government conspiracy.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.000
Global warming?

26:43.035 --> 26:45.100
Also government conspiracy.

26:45.135 --> 26:46.200
Really?

26:46.600 --> 26:49.100
Well, if they get everyone
concerned about global warming,

26:49.135 --> 26:50.800
no one will pay attention
to the fact that there's still

26:50.835 --> 26:53.000
large scale animal testing.

26:53.035 --> 26:54.300
Interesting.

26:54.335 --> 26:57.700
You know that the presidency is bought
and paid for by the cosmetics industry.

26:57.735 --> 27:00.000
I better look that
one up at the library.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.200
So they can't trace it.

27:02.900 --> 27:05.100
Are we
expecting someone?

27:11.300 --> 27:14.000
- Hello, Ben.
- Benny. Thomas here.

27:14.035 --> 27:15.400
How can we help you?

27:15.435 --> 27:17.000
He said how
can we help you, Ben?

27:17.035 --> 27:19.100
I brought this for Amy,
it's just a gift.

27:19.135 --> 27:20.800
Hey there, bus-stop boy,
how's it hangin'?

27:20.835 --> 27:22.800
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Benjamin.

27:22.835 --> 27:24.100
Hi, Mr. Juergens.

27:24.135 --> 27:26.900
I brought this for Amy.
When she gets home from work,

27:26.935 --> 27:28.600
there will be a little treat
waiting for her.

27:28.635 --> 27:30.100
That Amy.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.600
- I hope she's okay with this job.
- Yeah.

27:33.635 --> 27:35.100
I mean it's really good
that she got something,

27:35.135 --> 27:36.300
it's good that Anne
got something.

27:36.335 --> 27:39.200
But, this?
I mean, come on.

27:39.235 --> 27:41.300
I'm so glad you said that.
We're in complete agreement.

27:41.335 --> 27:44.900
I hate that either one of them
has to work at the Hot Dog Hut.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.700
But it's a job.

27:51.735 --> 27:54.500
It's an honest job,
and people love hot dogs,

27:54.535 --> 27:57.200
and although they're
not Boykewich hot dogs, I've--

27:57.235 --> 27:59.300
I've heard that
they're not too bad.

27:59.335 --> 28:02.000
You know, we were thinking,
Ashley and me and this guy here,

28:02.035 --> 28:04.800
we were thinking about going and
having dinner with Anne and Amy.

28:04.835 --> 28:07.800
You wanna go?
You know where they are exactly?

28:07.835 --> 28:09.200
Yeah,
but when I spoke with Amy,

28:09.235 --> 28:12.300
she said she didn't want
any us to come down there.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.200
That Amy. She probably
wants to focus on work.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.700
I'm sure she can take a break,
it'll be fine.

28:17.735 --> 28:19.400
Yeah, all right,
if you say so.

28:19.435 --> 28:20.600
Let's go,
my dad's in the car.

28:20.635 --> 28:22.400
Hold on,
I wanna get my camera.

28:22.435 --> 28:24.100
I'll be waiting in the car.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.700
I don't guess we're allowed
to stay in the house alone.

28:27.735 --> 28:30.500
If we walk into the kitchen
right now, he won't miss us.

28:30.535 --> 28:32.200
Invisible, remember?

28:32.400 --> 28:34.200
Oh, yeah.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.600
Give me your sneakers.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.800
Wha--?

29:02.300 --> 29:03.816
- Thanks, dude.
- Thanks.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.500
I'll buy those back from you.

29:07.535 --> 29:08.400
Here.

29:08.435 --> 29:11.000
All right,
what you got, man?

29:12.900 --> 29:14.700
We're gonna give you
a three-second head start.

29:14.735 --> 29:15.700
Three sec--?

29:15.735 --> 29:17.400
- One...
- Okay.

29:17.435 --> 29:18.800
- Two.
- Pebble! Pebble!

29:18.835 --> 29:20.400
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

29:20.435 --> 29:23.000
We're just joking,
having fun, come back.

29:23.035 --> 29:24.100
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:24.135 --> 29:25.900
All right.

29:25.935 --> 29:27.900
What, you think your shoes
are cooler than ours?

29:27.935 --> 29:30.200
Let me answer
that for you: No.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.300
We don't want
your shoes, man.

29:33.335 --> 29:35.200
Thank you.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.800
And what
are you running from?

29:37.835 --> 29:40.700
I'm trying to catch the guy
who stole my candy bar money.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.100
Wait a minute,
you're not, um...

29:47.135 --> 29:48.900
You don't know a kid
named Duncan, do you?

29:48.935 --> 29:50.000
Yeah, I'm his mentor.

29:51.900 --> 29:54.800
- What?
- Duncan pulled that $2 candy bar scam on you?

29:54.835 --> 29:57.700
It's not a scam.
They're for disadvantaged youth.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.500
And those are $5 bars.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.400
Wait, wait.

30:06.435 --> 30:08.700
You didn't get
with Shawna, did you?

30:08.900 --> 30:11.600
Look, man, Duncan is not
in favor of anybody,

30:11.635 --> 30:14.700
whether white, black,
brown, male, or female,

30:14.735 --> 30:16.600
having a sexual relationship
with his sister.

30:16.635 --> 30:17.900
And it's not about race,

30:17.935 --> 30:20.000
it's about a simple matter
of Duncan

30:20.035 --> 30:22.200
doing what he can do
to protect Shawna

30:22.235 --> 30:25.200
to ensure that she is never hurt,
emotionally or physically.

30:25.235 --> 30:27.300
Thus, the ruse
of staging a fake robbery

30:27.335 --> 30:28.800
to perhaps scare you off,

30:28.835 --> 30:31.200
or just let you know
that Duncan is on to you

30:31.235 --> 30:33.100
and will be watching you
for the duration

30:33.135 --> 30:35.900
of your relationship
with Shawna.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.700
Or your relationship with
Duncan, whichever lasts longer.

30:38.735 --> 30:40.800
-Huh?
-Psych major.

30:40.835 --> 30:41.800
A fake robbery?

30:41.835 --> 30:42.900
You are chasing Duncan.

30:42.935 --> 30:44.700
You know that, right?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.600
You need a ride?

30:53.800 --> 30:56.000
Yeah, actually I do.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.900
Thank you.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.800
Oh, I wasn't expecting you.

31:09.835 --> 31:12.700
And I wasn't expecting to see
you wearing Grace's sweater

31:12.735 --> 31:14.300
and a pearl necklace.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.100
Can I come in?

31:16.135 --> 31:18.300
I'm expecting someone.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.500
Your brother?

31:19.535 --> 31:20.700
Maybe.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.300
You can't sleep
with your brother, Adrian.

31:23.335 --> 31:24.700
I'm not planning on it.

31:24.735 --> 31:27.100
I'm not planning on having sex
again until I'm married.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.000
I'm sorry, did I walk in
on fantasy night?

31:29.035 --> 31:30.400
Is this some sort of role play?

31:30.435 --> 31:32.700
I'm thinking about
reclaiming my virginity.

31:32.735 --> 31:33.800
How do you do that?

31:33.835 --> 31:35.800
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

31:35.835 --> 31:38.600
Maybe I'd like to reclaim
my virginity with you.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.500
Does it involve sex?

31:40.600 --> 31:42.100
Because I'm needing
some sex, Adrian.

31:42.135 --> 31:43.300
I've had a hard day.

31:43.335 --> 31:46.500
So you've come over here
for me to make it all better

31:46.535 --> 31:48.100
by having sex with you?

31:48.135 --> 31:49.600
- Yeah.
- No.

31:49.635 --> 31:51.100
I'm not doing that anymore.

31:51.135 --> 31:52.900
You don't make
a good tease, Adrian.

31:52.935 --> 31:55.000
I'm not teasing. I'm serious.

31:55.035 --> 31:58.300
You can't reclaim your
virginity, don't be ridiculous.

31:58.335 --> 31:59.500
You are who you are, Adrian.

31:59.535 --> 32:01.300
You can't rewrap the gift.

32:01.335 --> 32:03.300
It's been given, many times.

32:03.335 --> 32:06.100
It doesn't matter. I'm starting over.

32:06.135 --> 32:08.500
Great. Start over with me.
I'll be your first.

32:08.535 --> 32:09.800
I don't know.

32:09.835 --> 32:11.900
I don't know if I want you
to be my first.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.900
Hey.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.300
Good night.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.100
Good night, nice meeting you.

32:21.135 --> 32:23.700
Sorry, that was
my old boyfriend Ricky.

32:23.735 --> 32:24.900
He just dropped by.

32:24.935 --> 32:26.500
No explanation necessary.

32:26.535 --> 32:28.000
We're not exclusive.

32:30.700 --> 32:33.400
This is for you. Remember when
you said you wanted a teddy bear

32:33.435 --> 32:35.429
for Christmas and didn't tell anyone

32:35.429 --> 32:37.600
 because you were scared
you wouldn't get it?

32:37.635 --> 32:39.000
You actually listen
to what I'm saying?

32:39.035 --> 32:41.000
Yeah, you say
interesting things.

32:41.035 --> 32:43.700
- Anyway, there's your teddy bear.
- I love it.

32:43.735 --> 32:44.800
Good.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.900
I'm a virgin.

32:50.935 --> 32:53.000
See, that's interesting
that you would say that.

32:53.035 --> 32:57.000
Because before, you told me
you were not a virgin.

32:57.300 --> 33:00.000
Okay, well, I'm thinking
about becoming a virgin.

33:00.035 --> 33:03.700
See, I'm thinking about asking God
to forgive me for having sex,

33:03.735 --> 33:06.900
and then promising not to have
sex again until I'm married.

33:06.935 --> 33:08.200
You think God cares about that?

33:08.235 --> 33:10.100
More importantly, do you?

33:10.135 --> 33:11.300
No, I don't care.

33:11.335 --> 33:15.300
I was thinking that
this is our third date so,

33:15.500 --> 33:18.600
you know, if you wanna
take that next step,

33:18.635 --> 33:20.400
and have sex...

33:21.200 --> 33:23.800
So the courting is over?

33:23.835 --> 33:26.500
Because I really
like the courting.

33:26.535 --> 33:28.100
I-- I like the teddy bear.

33:28.135 --> 33:32.100
I like the flowers, and
I like dating. I like you.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.800
I like you too.

33:33.835 --> 33:36.000
Would you still like me
if we had sex?

33:36.035 --> 33:37.900
I'd probably like you a lot.

33:37.935 --> 33:39.300
Look, let's talk about this.

33:39.335 --> 33:40.100
About what?

33:40.135 --> 33:43.500
Let's talk about sex.
Birth control, past partners.

33:43.535 --> 33:45.000
- Ricky.
- Why?

33:45.035 --> 33:46.700
Because we should talk
before we have sex.

33:46.735 --> 33:47.900
Again, why?

33:47.935 --> 33:50.400
Because there's just some business
we should get out of the way

33:50.435 --> 33:52.000
before we
get into a relationship.

33:52.035 --> 33:55.200
Sexual relationship or
relationship relationship?

33:55.235 --> 33:57.900
Isn't sex part
of a relationship?

33:57.935 --> 34:02.933
I am so confused.
Uh, maybe it's this sweater.

34:03.700 --> 34:06.100
Maybe it's like
those traveling pants.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.400
Let's go get
a bite to eat and talk.

34:09.435 --> 34:12.199
- Have you had dinner yet?
- No.

34:18.300 --> 34:22.000
It's okay, Adrian, it's okay.

34:22.034 --> 34:25.800
Virgin, or not a virgin,
it's okay.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.400
No, Dad, I'm not upset.
I really don't care.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.600
No, we don't want hot dogs,
I made something here.

34:35.635 --> 34:38.100
Thomas.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.400
All right, bye.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.800
Here's that thing that
I was talking about.

34:43.835 --> 34:47.500
The same corporation that
produces the aluminum cans

34:47.534 --> 34:48.900
owns the recycling plant,

34:48.935 --> 34:51.300
so what we're actually doing
is helping them to resell us

34:51.335 --> 34:52.199
what we already paid for.

34:52.235 --> 34:55.600
I would be upset but you gotta
admit, that's pretty smart.

34:55.635 --> 34:58.600
And a nickel on every can
goes to no-kill shelters.

34:58.635 --> 35:01.800
Yeah, but they charge
250 bucks for rescued dogs.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.500
Yeah, I went there.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.500
That's crazy.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.700
Thanks, hon.

35:10.735 --> 35:11.900
Anytime.

35:11.935 --> 35:13.500
Cheers.

35:17.600 --> 35:18.700
So how was your day?

35:18.735 --> 35:20.600
School sucks.

35:20.635 --> 35:22.400
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.800
This is delicious.

35:24.835 --> 35:26.200
It's nice to have
a home-cooked meal.

35:26.235 --> 35:28.300
People don't do this enough.

35:28.335 --> 35:29.400
Dinner with the family.

35:29.435 --> 35:32.700
Yeah, then again,
we're not family.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.800
How old are you really?

35:37.400 --> 35:39.200
I'm 13.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.500
I knew it.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.300
There you go.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.700
How much longer
you guys working tonight?

35:46.735 --> 35:49.100
Should be finished in an hour.
Unless the boss says otherwise.

35:49.135 --> 35:50.200
We got an inspector
coming tomorrow.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.700
Well, good luck with that.

35:51.735 --> 35:53.800
- Good night.
- Thanks.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.100
Just one more hour, Amy.

35:56.135 --> 35:58.300
And we will have completed
our first day of work.

35:58.335 --> 35:59.300
Another hour?

35:59.335 --> 36:00.500
Yes, another hour.

36:00.535 --> 36:03.600
But you've made 50 bucks
tonight. Isn't that great?

36:04.900 --> 36:07.600
-Anne?
-Hey! Look who's here!

36:07.635 --> 36:09.200
- Oh, no.
- Hi, Leo. Hi, Ben.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.500
Wanted to check out the
competition. How are the dogs?

36:11.535 --> 36:13.200
Why don't you order
a couple and see?

36:13.235 --> 36:15.600
I'll do that, give me a couple
of them, just mustard.

36:15.635 --> 36:16.500
Ben?

36:16.535 --> 36:19.100
Oh, uh,
just Amy, please.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.300
Couple of yellow dogs

36:20.335 --> 36:23.300
and Amy, why don't
you take a break?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.200
I should have taken French.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.500
So how are you?

36:31.535 --> 36:32.900
I'm good.

36:32.935 --> 36:35.300
So is George.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.400
Hee-hee! Employee of the month!

36:38.435 --> 36:42.400
Make fun of me all you want,
George, but I love working here.

36:42.435 --> 36:43.600
I'll be over
there with Amy--

36:43.635 --> 36:45.800
No, wait.

36:45.835 --> 36:46.800
Thanks.

36:46.835 --> 36:48.100
There you go.

36:48.135 --> 36:50.800
- Keep the change. Thank you.
- Thanks.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.600
Those dogs look good.
Can you make me one?

36:53.635 --> 36:55.400
You know how I like it.

36:55.435 --> 36:58.100
Fernando,
can you take a hot dog,

36:58.135 --> 37:01.800
split it down the middle,
put it on the grill to brown it,

37:01.835 --> 37:04.400
and then take those onions
and put it in the middle

37:04.435 --> 37:08.100
with just a little bit
of ketchup?

37:08.700 --> 37:10.400
Coming right up.

37:10.435 --> 37:12.600
What?

37:12.635 --> 37:13.600
What, miss?

37:13.635 --> 37:15.300
I thought you
only spoke Spanish.

37:15.335 --> 37:17.200
I thought your daughter
needed a job.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.600
Thanks, Fernando.

37:18.635 --> 37:20.300
Gracias.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.700
- What, you speaking the language now?
- Maybe.

37:22.735 --> 37:25.000
Maybe I'll learn Spanish
if I work here long enough.

37:25.035 --> 37:27.400
- You're really gonna work here?
- I am working here.

37:27.435 --> 37:29.200
And you know what?
I love it.

37:29.235 --> 37:32.200
What about your power suit, huh?
Admit it, you can't get a job.

37:32.235 --> 37:34.100
- Not a real job.
- This is a real job.

37:34.135 --> 37:35.400
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

37:35.435 --> 37:38.600
- Admit it. You need me.
- No, I don't.

37:40.700 --> 37:42.500
- Here.
- Read the grease on the wall,

37:42.535 --> 37:43.800
you're never gonna make it.

37:43.835 --> 37:45.300
Next!

37:51.500 --> 37:54.800
Hi. Can I just have
a cup of coffee?

37:54.835 --> 37:57.300
Uh, you could, but

37:57.335 --> 37:59.000
all we have
are these Styrofoam cups,

37:59.035 --> 38:02.100
and I hate those. You wouldn't
happen to have a coffee mug on you?

38:02.135 --> 38:04.200
I do in my car.

38:04.235 --> 38:05.000
If you wanna go get it,

38:05.035 --> 38:07.400
I'll brew a fresh pot
of coffee for you.

38:07.435 --> 38:08.600
That one's been in there
a while.

38:08.635 --> 38:11.800
You know, I've been coming
to the Hot Dog Hut for a while

38:11.835 --> 38:14.800
and, uh, I've never seen
you here before.

38:14.835 --> 38:17.500
And I was gonna ask you
what you're doing working here

38:17.535 --> 38:19.700
but I guess I found out.

38:19.735 --> 38:22.000
- Divorce, huh?
- Yep.

38:22.035 --> 38:24.500
- Is this your first day of work?
- Yeah, it is.

38:24.535 --> 38:26.500
I looked around for a while,
but, um,

38:26.535 --> 38:28.900
yeah, I've been home
for 15 years so...

38:29.200 --> 38:31.300
This is the best I could do.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.900
You know what? It's actually
not so bad, it's kind of fun.

38:33.935 --> 38:37.100
I'm the architect on the
renovation across the street.

38:37.135 --> 38:40.900
We're trying to transition
into being a more green firm.

38:40.935 --> 38:44.100
You wouldn't know anything
about environmental supplies,

38:44.135 --> 38:46.000
or construction,
or anything like that?

38:46.035 --> 38:49.000
No, but I didn't know anything
about hot dogs till today.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.100
You should give me a call.

38:50.135 --> 38:52.500
We're looking for somebody
to do research,

38:52.535 --> 38:55.400
manage vendor relationships,
that kind of thing.

38:55.435 --> 38:57.200
You should come see me, we should talk.

38:57.235 --> 39:01.200
Okay. I will. Thanks.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.200
Oh, wait, do you want
that cup of coffee?

39:03.235 --> 39:06.100
Oh, I never really
wanted a cup of coffee.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.900
Call me.

39:11.800 --> 39:15.800
Ah. America.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.100
But you don'havet
to go back there.

39:25.135 --> 39:26.600
You don't have
to go back to work.

39:26.635 --> 39:28.000
I'm gonna take care of you.

39:28.035 --> 39:31.400
- How?
- Amy, my dad is the Sausage King.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.400
You don't have to be
the hot dog girl.

39:33.435 --> 39:35.100
I hate
being the hot dog girl.

39:35.135 --> 39:38.100
As if being pregnant at 15
isn't humiliating enough.

39:38.135 --> 39:38.900
Like you said,

39:38.935 --> 39:41.300
your mom's just trying
to teach you a lesson.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.000
She's probably just trying
to motivate you

39:43.035 --> 39:45.000
to find the right family
for the baby.

39:45.035 --> 39:47.200
You'd think that Ricky's mom
would help out.

39:47.300 --> 39:49.000
She's a social worker.

39:49.035 --> 39:50.600
Oh, that's right.

39:50.635 --> 39:52.400
She just lured
Donovan and Leon away

39:52.435 --> 39:53.900
with those foster kids.

39:53.935 --> 39:57.000
Probably because Ricky really
doesn't want the baby adopted.

39:57.035 --> 39:58.000
I don't care
what Ricky wants.

39:58.035 --> 39:59.900
He said he'd go along
with whatever I said.

39:59.935 --> 40:03.900
As it turns out, I think he's
going along with what I said.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.800
Ricky and I got into
a couple of,

40:05.835 --> 40:08.200
heh,
heated discussions today.

40:08.235 --> 40:10.600
- About?
- About the fact that he can't afford

40:10.635 --> 40:13.400
to pay child support and raise
a baby for the next 18 years.

40:13.435 --> 40:14.700
And that he should just back off

40:14.735 --> 40:16.800
and let you and me
take care of the baby.

40:16.835 --> 40:20.700
Amy, if you choose
to keep the baby,

40:20.900 --> 40:24.100
I can give your son
the best of everything.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.500
He's right.

40:25.535 --> 40:27.800
No, he is not right.

40:27.835 --> 40:29.400
Are you out of your mind,
Benjamin?

40:29.435 --> 40:30.800
You don't have a dime.

40:30.835 --> 40:32.800
I have dimes, you don't.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.100
And what Anne is doing here
is very admirable.

40:35.135 --> 40:37.800
She's working hard at an honest
job to get what she wants,

40:37.835 --> 40:39.600
and if you wanna be
this baby's father,

40:39.635 --> 40:41.500
you should be willing
to work hard too.

40:41.535 --> 40:43.500
And even then,
you may not end up rich.

40:43.535 --> 40:46.200
It's not about being rich.
It's all about working.

40:46.235 --> 40:48.200
Working is a good thing
in and of itself.

40:48.235 --> 40:49.700
I started out working
at a butcher shop

40:49.735 --> 40:51.200
when I was 13 years old.

40:51.235 --> 40:53.600
I worked my butt off
to get what we have.

40:53.635 --> 40:56.100
And if you love this girl, and
you wanna take care of her son,

40:56.135 --> 40:59.300
you get your butt up and get in
that kitchen and help her out.

40:59.335 --> 41:00.900
And tomorrow
start looking for a job,

41:00.935 --> 41:03.900
the way I told you
to do weeks ago.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.500
It's okay. He'll come around,
I'm the only child.

41:09.535 --> 41:12.100
Right, got it. Thanks, Dad.

41:12.135 --> 41:14.800
Parents. Butcher shop
when he was 13.

41:14.835 --> 41:16.300
It's the family butcher shop.

41:16.335 --> 41:18.700
We still own it.

41:20.100 --> 41:20.700
What?

41:20.735 --> 41:22.000
You don't have
to help me out in there.

41:22.035 --> 41:25.100
Amy, I'd do anything for you.

41:25.135 --> 41:27.700
Anything but get a job.

41:28.600 --> 41:29.700
I know, that was a joke.

41:29.735 --> 41:31.700
I'll try to get something.

41:37.700 --> 41:40.700
- Kid's gonna drive me nuts.
- That's a kid's job.

41:40.735 --> 41:43.600
To bust your ass
every single day.

41:43.635 --> 41:46.600
He's a good kid, but if he thinks
he's ready to be a father,

41:46.635 --> 41:48.000
he's got another thought coming.

41:48.035 --> 41:49.900
I mean, if Amy wants
to keep the baby,

41:49.935 --> 41:52.700
and he wants to be a part of her
life, part of the baby's life,

41:52.735 --> 41:54.500
that's fine with me,
I love both of 'em,

41:54.535 --> 41:57.200
but he should work
a little harder, a lot harder.

41:57.235 --> 41:59.800
I had no idea
Ben was this lazy.

41:59.900 --> 42:02.200
He's nice, he's smart.

42:02.235 --> 42:04.300
But man, is he lazy.

42:04.700 --> 42:06.500
I'm gonna give him a job
at that butcher shop

42:06.535 --> 42:09.800
where I started out.
Come on, let's go.

42:09.835 --> 42:11.400
He can get a ride home
from Anne and Amy.

42:11.435 --> 42:12.900
Yeah. Okay.

42:13.300 --> 42:15.400
Hey, you wanna beat that guy up
who was flirting with Anne

42:15.435 --> 42:16.300
on the way to the car?

42:16.335 --> 42:18.200
There was a guy
flirting with Anne?

42:18.235 --> 42:19.200
You saw him.

42:19.235 --> 42:21.700
Yeah, well, what are you
gonna do, George?

42:21.735 --> 42:24.300
Come on. Let's go.

42:43.231 --> 42:45.500
