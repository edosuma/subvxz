Previously on 90210:
It's probably

00:03.170 --> 00:04.755
just nerves
waking up.
You should probably
see a doctor.

00:04.797 --> 00:05.923
There's no way in hell
I'm letting

00:05.965 --> 00:07.048
anything get in the way of this.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.342
Do you think we could
talk about stuff?

00:08.383 --> 00:10.051
Talk about what?
Our relationship

00:10.093 --> 00:11.052
is important to me.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.346
And my career's important to me.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.640
Have a great show.
DIXON:
Have you seen Ade?

00:14.682 --> 00:16.391
I was actually looking
around for Silver.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.893
Can't believe she's not here.

00:17.935 --> 00:20.270
I guess the problems that Dixon
and I had before the accident

00:20.312 --> 00:22.564
never really went away.
Now you're
fighting things

00:22.606 --> 00:24.065
that maybe you should
just go with.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.233
So, what do you think?

00:25.275 --> 00:26.694

some little clam shack...
Hey, I'm sorry.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.738
This is really great.
Have you seen Liam?

00:29.780 --> 00:30.990
I got to talk to him
about something.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.908
You have no right to judge me.
You don't even know me.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.202
And you don't know me.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.078
YOUNG MAN:
You will not believe
what I just got vid of.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.998

totally doing some chick.

allow video of our customers.

It's Liam.
DIXON:
Is that his teacher?

00:43.752 --> 00:46.171
This guy is unbelievable.
NAOMI: The busboy's not
your only fan.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.089
Annie, go talk to him.
ANNIE:
I will go...

00:48.131 --> 00:49.216
and have a drink with him.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.468
So, where's your man,
the world traveler?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.345
Colin is stuck at work.
I can sit
here and just

00:53.387 --> 00:55.723
spit out some crap I read
in travel and leisure for you.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.140
NAOMI:
Alec knew exactly where I was.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.433
COLIN:
He's been using your GPS

00:58.475 --> 00:59.351

00:59.393 --> 01:00.728
You'd like to
reverse this pathway

the hell they were doing hacked

01:05.774 --> 01:07.442

This could sink us.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.610

fogged up.

01:26.921 --> 01:30.049

move this off campus.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.355
I'm a professor,
you're a student.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.899
There are rules
about these things.

01:46.941 --> 01:49.526
Actually, I looked it up
in the handbook.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.862
You can't have a relationship

I don't like
all this sneaking around.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.500
I've been in these

02:05.542 --> 02:06.710
They never end well.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.336
I'm not saying we'll
keep it secret forever.

02:09.378 --> 02:12.382
Just until we figure out
what exactly this is.

02:12.424 --> 02:15.218
So we have to sneak around L.A.,
but what about Santa Barbara?

02:15.260 --> 02:17.054
I have to go
to Phenomi-con this weekend

02:17.096 --> 02:18.597

You should come.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.641
That's a comic
book convention.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.601
There's gonna be college
kids all over the place.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.227
Not to mention reporters.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.229
I'll see you when
you get back.

02:26.271 --> 02:30.191
And, hey, maybe while you're
gone, I'll buy a bigger car.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.569

our network, but
it wasn't hacked.

Someone logged in

Before we could
lock it down,

the video game

02:49.128 --> 02:50.754
that we've been
working on with Liam?

02:50.796 --> 02:53.048
Right, so I
created a special

02:53.090 --> 02:55.174
graphics engine for it that
converts a cell-phone photo

02:55.216 --> 02:57.052
that you take of yourself
into a digital avatar,

02:57.094 --> 02:59.013
and then you can play
with it in the game.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.640
It's unlike anything
that's ever been done before.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.975
Now it's
been stolen.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.184
So it's just gone.
You can't use it?

03:05.226 --> 03:06.185
The video game
business

03:06.227 --> 03:07.395
is all about being first.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.106
So if whoever stole it
finds a way

03:09.148 --> 03:11.733
to market it before we do,
then we're screwed.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.110
I just...

03:13.152 --> 03:15.154
I don't understand
how this happened.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.823
I think I do.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.908
The other night
at the club opening, I was...

03:19.950 --> 03:21.618
distracted.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.079
I left my phone at the
bar for a few minutes.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.414
If someone cloned it, they'd
have all my security clearances.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.876
How exactly were you distracted?

03:30.127 --> 03:31.962
You know what?

03:32.004 --> 03:33.130
Who cares whose fault it is?

03:33.172 --> 03:34.798
What matters is how we fix it.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.842
If being first is a big deal,
then release the game now.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.427
I mean, Liam's gonna be at that
nerd convention. Do it there.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.057
Honey, that's sweet,
but it's not that simple.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.474
Phenomi-con starts tomorrow.

03:44.516 --> 03:47.310
I mean, we were gonna be lucky
if we got the game

03:47.352 --> 03:49.270
ready in time for Christmas.
It's-it's not gonna work.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.732
We can't get the whole game
ready for Phenomi-con,

03:51.773 --> 03:53.775
but we might be able
to finish a demo.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.403
Then, no matter what happens,
we'll still be first, right?

03:56.444 --> 03:57.779
What do
you think?

03:57.821 --> 03:59.698
I mean, if we're gonna get
the codes finished in time,

03:59.740 --> 04:00.741
it's gonna take all night.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.159

04:24.264 --> 04:25.265
I was wrong.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.892
And I'm here to apologize.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.227

04:28.268 --> 04:29.436
Yeah, and you should feel

04:29.477 --> 04:31.271
honored, too, because I almost
never apologize.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.023
Then again, I'm almost
never wrong.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.650
So...
Well, your sincerity
is touching.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.737

is that we were having

04:38.779 --> 04:40.447
a good time the other night.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.907
And then Rand McNally showed up

04:41.949 --> 04:44.492
and I got jealous.

04:44.534 --> 04:48.705
It's...
it's because I-I like you.

04:48.747 --> 04:52.167

08:13.785 --> 08:15.329
Hey.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.621
I've got ten minutes.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.463
(theme music playing)

08:39.352 --> 08:41.980
Okay... (gasps)

08:42.022 --> 08:43.773
Welcome to the hack-a-thon!

08:43.815 --> 08:45.400
Honey, this is amazing.
(laughs)

08:45.442 --> 08:46.651
You know,
we really could've

08:46.693 --> 08:48.028
pulled an all-nighter
at the office.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.364
Nonsense-- these little geeks
are going to be working

08:50.405 --> 08:52.532
till the wee hours
to get ready for Phenomi-con.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.159
If you want
to maximize production,

08:54.201 --> 08:56.203
you have to incentivize!

08:56.244 --> 08:57.496
Ergonomic chairs.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.956
Monitors with glare filters
to reduce eye strain.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.666
Ludwig will make
drinks to order

09:01.708 --> 09:03.835
and give everything
a double shot of guarana.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.546
The DJ has been instructed to
give a steady, driving beat.

09:06.587 --> 09:09.883
And there's a pound of cocaine
on the kitchen counter.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.051
Kidding. (laughs)

09:11.092 --> 09:13.553
I just hope this works.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.888
Our R.A.D. engine

09:14.929 --> 09:16.890
is still buggy, so we got
to run a special algorithm

09:16.931 --> 09:19.017
to stabilize it, and that kind
of thing usually takes weeks.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.685
You can focus on the math.

09:20.727 --> 09:24.272
I will focus on the morale.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.399
Mwah!

09:25.440 --> 09:27.067
Wow, talk about incentive.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.194
ALEC:
I had to pull some strings,

09:29.236 --> 09:31.363
but I got us a convention
room for tomorrow.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.240
Great, now we can focus
on the presentation.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.449
First, I got
to ask you something.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.954
Um, after everything between us,
why'd you cover for me with Max?

09:39.996 --> 09:42.332
Look, Alec, I don't
have an angle.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.834
I was the one distracting you
when you lost your phone

09:44.876 --> 09:46.794
and neither of us
want Max to know that.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.255
But despite what
you might think,

09:48.296 --> 09:49.964
I actually want what's best
for this company.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.384
Well, thanks.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.010
Let's not braid
each other's hair just yet.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.887
Hey, who's this guy?

09:55.929 --> 09:56.971
Oh, I invited him.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.473
He's Annie's little
computer nerd Colin.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.808
Thank you so much for coming.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.477
You know code?
Hey, uh, sure, yeah.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.396
I work in I.T.
at an insurance company.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.731
Okay, well, uh, grab some coffee
and check in with Max.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.358
He'll tell you
what he needs.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.277
Good.
All right.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.572
Hey, I'm really sorry
that this is so last-minute.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.822
No, this will be fun.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.242
When I worked in Sydney,
we'd write code all night

10:17.284 --> 10:18.910
and in the mornings
we'd go diving

10:18.952 --> 10:20.203
off the Great
Barrier Reef.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.996
Oh, that sounds amazing,
but, um,

10:22.038 --> 10:24.374
isn't the Great Barrier Reef
in Queensland?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.501
Yeah.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.627
That's what I meant,
Queensland.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.337
I'm gonna get some coffee.
(laughs)

10:33.216 --> 10:35.093
Silver just texted.
She's ready to go.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.178
One of you guys lock up for me?

10:37.220 --> 10:39.722
Yep, you know me,
always got your back.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.266
Thanks, man.
Later!

10:41.308 --> 10:44.311
Hey, you think
they're gonna hook up?

10:44.352 --> 10:45.979
Dude, you just opened
your first successful club.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.939
You should be up to
your elbows in hot tail.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.191
Why do you care?
Liam should have
the guts to tell me,

10:50.233 --> 10:52.360
that's all. And I'm worried
Silver's gonna get hurt.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.404
And he's clearly lying
to her about his professor...

10:54.446 --> 10:56.615
Why can't you see
what a jerk he is?

10:56.656 --> 10:59.075
He's a jerk 'cause he wants
to sleep with two girls?

10:59.117 --> 11:00.827
I know a lot of jerks.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.414
Yeah, I told you
about that video I took

11:04.456 --> 11:06.458
from that kid
at the Pop Up, right?

11:06.500 --> 11:07.584
The sex tape?

11:07.626 --> 11:09.461
You're not gonna do
anything with that.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.045
You're too nice a guy.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.591
You're right. I am.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.010
And that's why
I'm gonna show it to Silver

11:17.051 --> 11:18.386
and prove that Liam's lying.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.430
Before she does
something she'll regret.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.891
Hey, dude.
Where you going?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.102
Phenomi-con.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.145
Phenomi...?

11:27.187 --> 11:28.980
He is obsessed

11:29.022 --> 11:30.731
with Liam and Silver.
What's new?

11:30.773 --> 11:33.193
I'm telling you, man,
Liam did a number on him.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.111
You don't mess with
another guy's girl.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.279
You don't.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.615
So, what are you doing here?

11:38.657 --> 11:41.826
Oh, uh, I'm just picking up
the rest of my equipment.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.204
You mind helping me out
a little?
Yeah, yeah, sure.

11:44.245 --> 11:47.706
Thanks. Oh, uh, by the way,
what'd you think of the set?

11:47.748 --> 11:49.292
I had to step out for a while.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.044
Um, I heard
it was great, though.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.086
Damn, dude.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.463
Adrianna missed it, too.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.298
I don't know, I...

11:55.340 --> 11:57.551
I kind of snapped at her.
She left.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.135
Well, it was
a big night for you.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.470
No, no, man.
I-I've been

12:00.512 --> 12:01.971
kind of being
being a jerk lately.

12:02.013 --> 12:05.433
(sighs) We got into another
argument this morning.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.685
It-it just sucks.

12:06.725 --> 12:10.021
You know? It really does.
I really wanted her to see it.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.857
She's, like, the most important
person in the world to me.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.078
(air horn blares)

12:25.119 --> 12:26.663
What the...?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.666
Listen up, everybody!

12:29.708 --> 12:33.002
I know it's 3:30 in the morning
and you're all exhausted,

12:33.044 --> 12:35.004
which is why I'm rolling
out the big guns.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.716
From here on out, when you
finish a line of code,

12:37.756 --> 12:40.051
you will get three
minutes in the chair

12:40.093 --> 12:42.929
with my certified
massage therapist, Gigi.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.482
LINDSEY:
Annie?

12:54.524 --> 12:56.109
You're here late.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.569
Oh, hi,
Professor Beckwith.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.696
My friend Naomi lives nearby and
we're pulling an all-nighter.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.239
The guy I'm seeing
wanted Brain Shock,

13:01.281 --> 13:02.781
and this is
the closest place open.

13:02.823 --> 13:03.950
What are you still doing here?

13:03.991 --> 13:05.744
Grading papers
in my office.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.621
Exciting weekend, huh?
(laughs)

13:07.662 --> 13:09.581
Oh, hey, I've been
meaning to thank you

13:09.623 --> 13:11.832
for helping my friend Liam
with his contract problem.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.502
Right. Liam.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.962
Nice guy.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.130
Yeah, maybe too nice.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.339
He let his
business partner-slash-

13:18.381 --> 13:20.799
girlfriend-slash-psycho bitch
walk all over him.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.594
Not that you needed
to know that.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.763
I'm... just had
way too much caffeine.

13:24.803 --> 13:27.098
It's okay, um...

13:27.140 --> 13:29.142
She was pretty crazy, huh?
Yeah.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.977
Well, he's got a long history
of dating the wrong girl.

13:31.018 --> 13:31.978
But who am I to talk?

13:32.019 --> 13:33.104
My track record
isn't great, either.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.023
You mean the energy drink guy?
Colin?

13:36.065 --> 13:37.858
No, Colin is great.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.111
Even if he couldn't pass
fourth grade geography.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.738
But you know what?
I'm not gonna do this.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.783
He is a perfectly good guy,
and when you find a good guy,

13:44.823 --> 13:47.327
you need to put your doubts
aside and make it work.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.164
Yeah, guess you do.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.624
That was a really
intense conversation

13:52.666 --> 13:55.335
for 3:00 in the morning.
I'm sorry. Brain Shock?

14:02.133 --> 14:04.177
(tapping on keyboard)

14:18.024 --> 14:20.777
(softly):
It's done.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.196
(clears throat)

14:24.947 --> 14:26.324
It's-it's done.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.034
Hey.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.704
Of course, it's so simple.

14:30.745 --> 14:31.996
Hey, everyone!

14:32.038 --> 14:33.206
Huh?

14:34.123 --> 14:35.958
Max did it.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.126
Huh?

14:37.168 --> 14:38.753
ALEC:
He did it?
We did it.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.047
NAOMI: Oh, my God!
My husband's a genius!

14:41.088 --> 14:43.924
(laughing):
We're going to Phenomi-con!

14:43.966 --> 14:45.635
(excited chatter)

14:45.677 --> 14:47.721
NAOMI:
We're going
to Phenomi-con!

14:47.762 --> 14:49.889
MAN:
Good job!

14:56.437 --> 14:57.772
Come on, guys.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.023
We have to leave now

14:59.065 --> 15:01.234
or there's a chance
we won't make it.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.986
Never tell me the odds.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.030
It's Han Solo.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.448
Yeah, I got that.
You're bringing

15:07.490 --> 15:08.783
a suit for
the presentation, right?

15:08.825 --> 15:11.536
NAOMI:
His Armani's already in the car.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.759
I love you.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.719
I know.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.387
(giggles)

15:29.429 --> 15:32.390
(sighs) I can't
believe I let you

15:32.432 --> 15:33.850
talk me
into being an elf.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.018
You look amazing.
Are you sure Colin

15:36.060 --> 15:37.645
doesn't want to come with us?
I don't know.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.397
He didn't even say good-bye
when he left last night.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.691
The poor boy's probably trying
to sleep off the hack-a-thon.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.192
Don't worry, you can
keep the costume

15:43.234 --> 15:45.403
and elf his brains out later.
Come on!

15:49.323 --> 15:51.785
♪ ♪

16:08.635 --> 16:11.971
♪ ♪

16:14.515 --> 16:16.976
MAN: Okay, you died
in Corporate Invaders one,

16:17.017 --> 16:18.853
so how are you even
in the sequel?

16:18.895 --> 16:20.647
Are we to assume
that Corporate Invaders 2

16:20.688 --> 16:23.483
is actually a prequel
like Temple of Doom?

16:23.524 --> 16:26.026
Or is this some lazy writer
just pulling a retcon on us?

16:26.068 --> 16:28.863
Um, I think
they cloned my DNA.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.615
No...

16:30.657 --> 16:31.991
your body burned in fire.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.410
Okay? How would the aliens
get a viable DNA sample?

16:34.452 --> 16:35.954
Oh, my God!
Liam Court?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.914
Will you sign
my boob?

16:37.956 --> 16:39.749
Hell, yes!
Sorry, guys.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.501
Can't pass this,
uh, opportunity up.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.670
SILVER:
I'm sorry. (giggles)

16:44.545 --> 16:46.339
Geez!
Oh, my God, Liam!

16:46.380 --> 16:48.591
Man, these guys
are obsessed.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.718
Yeah, but that obsession
is what made your movie

16:50.760 --> 16:52.219
number one at the box office.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.431
Yeah, I guess so.
Geez.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.808
This is so cool.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.352
I feel like I'm back
in Navid's high school bedroom.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.855
(laughs)
Like, old-school Navid,
not the new model...

17:01.896 --> 17:03.230
who dates porn stars.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.397
Ah, don't be
so hard on him.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.108
Whatever. I can't even
talk to him anymore.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.109
It's like he's running for
douche bag of the year.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.530
I think he's just got it in
his head that if he can show you

17:10.570 --> 17:13.031
how cool he is, then you'll
realize you made a mistake.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.034
Worst idea ever.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.117
There you go, proves it.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.538
Navid's the same
old guy he always was.
(laughs)

17:18.579 --> 17:20.373
Seriously, though,
you should give him a chance.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.710
Well, listen, I got to get
to the autograph booth.

17:23.751 --> 17:27.296
Try not to get impaled
by anything while I'm gone.
Deal.

17:27.338 --> 17:28.673
Okay. See you.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.513
Can you make
it out to "Amy,

17:35.555 --> 17:38.558
the future mother
of my child"?

17:38.599 --> 17:39.600
Uh...

17:39.642 --> 17:42.395
let's just go
with "my biggest fan."

17:42.436 --> 17:44.230
(deep breath)

17:44.271 --> 17:45.439
Next.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.529
Could you

17:51.571 --> 17:53.614
make it out to "Lindsey...

17:54.908 --> 17:56.409
...your second biggest fan"?

17:56.450 --> 17:58.118
What are you
doing here?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.955
I thought, uh, you didn't
want to be seen together.

18:00.997 --> 18:04.291
That's what
the mask's for, genius.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.627
When you find someone
you really want to be with,

18:06.669 --> 18:09.005
you figure out a way
to make it work.

18:10.548 --> 18:11.925
(knocking)

18:12.842 --> 18:14.176
I told Dixon

18:14.218 --> 18:15.469
I was going for eggs.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.346
I hate eggs.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.932
My alibis need some work.

18:20.850 --> 18:24.020
♪ ♪

18:24.062 --> 18:26.689
You're not big
into foreplay, are you?

18:28.691 --> 18:30.610
What's the...
game plan here?

18:30.651 --> 18:32.528
I don't really
have a game plan

18:32.570 --> 18:34.948
because if I think too hard
about what we're doing,

18:34.989 --> 18:36.323
I'm gonna
feel terrible.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.702
I already feel terrible.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.621
I saw Dixon at Offshore.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.957
What did you say to him?
Nothing.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.500
Uh, he said you two
got in another fight.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.294
Yeah, because all he
thinks about is his career.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.671
Ade, I didn't sign up to be the
guy that you get revenge with

18:50.713 --> 18:52.090
every time you're mad
at your boyfriend.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.257
You need to end it.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.968
I will, okay?

18:55.009 --> 18:56.552
As soon as he makes
a full recovery.

18:56.594 --> 19:00.473
He... he already played
the Pop Up the other night.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.350
What does he have to do,
run a four-minute mile?

19:03.392 --> 19:05.812
Okay, are we gonna
do this or not?

19:07.396 --> 19:08.689
No.

19:08.731 --> 19:12.026
Break up with Dixon
or we're done.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.990
(fans shouting "Max!")

19:18.658 --> 19:21.201
Wow, looks like he
finally found his tribe.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.453
Oh, computer guys love him.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.830
He's like a geek god.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.373
Okay, everything's in place
for the presentation.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.334
I think we really
pulled this off.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.378
It's like I've been telling you
all along: you, me and Max

19:31.420 --> 19:32.421
make a great team.

19:32.463 --> 19:33.547
ALEC: Who am I
to disagree?

19:33.589 --> 19:34.674
ANNIE:
Oh, my God, I think

19:34.715 --> 19:35.842
I just saw Colin.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.468
I bet he came here
to surprise you.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.678
Oh, he's so sweet.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.304
I'm so glad I forced you

19:40.346 --> 19:42.389
to date him.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.686
This comic book is
from the Silver Age.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.813
You smell that?

19:48.855 --> 19:51.398
That's paper and ink
from 50 years ago.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.818
(chuckles)
I had no idea you were
into this stuff.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.611
I have a confession to make.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.238
I told you that I saw
Corporate Invaders

19:58.280 --> 20:00.867
with an idiot
boyfriend, but...

20:00.908 --> 20:03.202
the truth is,
I went to see it

20:03.243 --> 20:04.996
by myself.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.956
Opening night.

20:06.998 --> 20:10.168
Do you cut photos of me
out of Tiger Beat, too, or...

20:10.209 --> 20:11.335
Don't flatter yourself.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.212
The movie sucked.
I didn't lie about that.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.380
You know, this is weird.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.716
I am signing
action figures of myself,

20:16.757 --> 20:18.676
and you're dressed as a...

20:18.718 --> 20:20.219
cheetah... thing.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.554
But this
is actually, like,

20:21.595 --> 20:23.430
the most normal date
that we've had.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.100
Yeah, it kind of is.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.186
It could be like this
all the time, you know?

20:28.227 --> 20:30.897
I mean, I'm not trying
to pressure you or anything.

20:30.938 --> 20:31.939
Just think about it.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.150
Okay.
Okay.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.609
You should get to
your press thing.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.570
Yeah.
I am going
to go look

20:37.611 --> 20:40.239
for a couple back copies
of Elf Quest,

20:40.280 --> 20:41.741
which is something you
should definitely do

20:41.782 --> 20:43.826
while you're still
wearing a mask.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.037
Yeah. (quiet laugh)

20:51.918 --> 20:54.461
Navid. What are
you doing here?

20:54.503 --> 20:56.172
Hey, uh, just
looking for Silver.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.798
Oh, uh, she's with the crew
getting ready

20:57.840 --> 20:59.592
for the VIP screening.
The director's showing us

20:59.633 --> 21:01.135
the first ten minutes
of the film.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.136
Is everything okay?

21:02.178 --> 21:03.763
Yeah, sure, it's just, uh,

21:03.804 --> 21:06.224
time to be honest
with her about a few things.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.559
Good, maybe you should
just kind of

21:08.601 --> 21:10.228
roll the douche bag
thing back a bit.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.271
What are you talking about?
I just mean
you're coming on

21:12.312 --> 21:14.148
a little strong, you know?
Give her some space.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.649
Yeah, I bet you'd like that.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.651
What does that mean?

21:17.693 --> 21:20.029
The last time I asked you
for advice, you said to go

21:20.071 --> 21:21.948
back to Princeton so you
could sleep with Silver.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.199
I'm not trying to
sleep with Silver.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.450
Right, because
a guy like you

21:24.491 --> 21:25.952
doesn't even have to try.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.245
I mean, women just
throw themselves

21:27.286 --> 21:28.621
at you at conventions,
parties...

21:28.662 --> 21:30.248
You know what?
Maybe this is not an act.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.916
Maybe you actually
are a douche bag.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.212
I'm a douche bag?
(scoffs)

21:36.254 --> 21:38.631
We'll see about that.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.217
This is a
great movie...

21:41.259 --> 21:43.844
Excuse me.

21:43.886 --> 21:46.139
Excuse me.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.515
Uh, excuse me, uh...
Yeah.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.517
You know where I can find
the VIP screening room?

21:50.559 --> 21:51.769
Yeah, are you,
uh, cast or crew?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.104
I'm from the studio.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.564
Uh, they sent me over with
the latest cut of the movie.

21:55.606 --> 21:58.609
Oh. Thanks.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.487
Mm-hmm.

22:03.114 --> 22:06.533
COLIN:
Ladies and gentlemen,
today is a day

22:06.575 --> 22:09.162
you will never forget.

22:09.203 --> 22:12.623
Because today, gaming technology

22:12.665 --> 22:15.126
takes a huge leap forward.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.460
Are you ready?

22:16.502 --> 22:18.462
(crowd cheers)

22:18.504 --> 22:19.797
NAOMI:
Annie?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.007
Did you
find Colin?

22:21.048 --> 22:23.092
Yeah, I did.

22:23.134 --> 22:26.512
The game is called
Eternal Conflict,

22:26.553 --> 22:29.389
and the hero is you.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.475
(crowd cheers)

22:37.023 --> 22:40.193
NAOMI:
Oh, my God.

22:40.234 --> 22:43.070
He stole Max's idea.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.329
(crowd cheers)

22:51.369 --> 22:53.914
COLIN:
Welcome to the future.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.249
There you have it.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.793
MAX:
I can't believe this.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.462
COLIN:
Thank you, thank you.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.764
NAOMI:
So it was Colin
who hacked the system?

23:10.806 --> 23:12.225
ANNIE:
I am so sorry, you guys.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.810
I should have known
something was up.
He obviously
had his game

23:14.852 --> 23:16.645
all ready to go; he just
needed the final codes.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.605
Yeah, and we worked
all night to give them to him.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.399
But when would Colin
have gotten my phone?

23:21.441 --> 23:22.568
At the Pop Up?

23:22.609 --> 23:23.986
Actually, I think
it might have been...

23:24.028 --> 23:26.446
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it had
to have been the Pop Up.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.782
Annie, I'm sure of it.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.076
So, Max, what are
we going to do?

23:30.117 --> 23:32.036
I can't go out there
and present our demo now.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.662
It's going to look
like we're copying him.

23:33.704 --> 23:35.289
So... I-I...
Hmm.

23:35.331 --> 23:36.498
We have to do something.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.834
Let's start with
killing him.

23:40.294 --> 23:42.462
Let me.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.886
Oh, Annie, you look adorable.

23:48.928 --> 23:49.970
What is this?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.013
You were just dating me

23:51.055 --> 23:53.015
so you could commit
corporate espionage?

23:53.057 --> 23:54.392
Ooh, that's a little dramatic.

23:54.432 --> 23:56.102
Nah, see, I own
a software company

23:56.143 --> 23:57.895
that would best
be described as fledgling.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.646
Well, until today.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.232
What is wrong with you?

24:01.274 --> 24:02.816
Hey, I'm not
the bad guy here.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.568
Okay? I spent the last
six months busting my ass

24:04.610 --> 24:06.112
to get the Colton Brothers
to work with me.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.822
And they went with Max's company
because he had Liam Court.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.574
All my work was for nothing.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.034
Now they know how that feels.

24:12.076 --> 24:13.577
You were just using me
the whole time.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.037
You were the one
who responded

24:15.079 --> 24:16.872
to the champagne I sent over
at the restaurant that day.
(sighs)

24:16.914 --> 24:20.918
My only regret is that we didn't
get time to get a little closer.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.920
(groans)

24:22.962 --> 24:24.380
Excuse me.

24:31.429 --> 24:32.430
Hey, Dixon?

24:32.470 --> 24:34.890
We need to talk.

24:36.309 --> 24:37.435
Oh, my God!

24:37.475 --> 24:39.228
What happened?

24:39.270 --> 24:40.729
Hey, I don't know.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.774
There's a sharp pain down my
back and I can't feel my legs.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.401
We're gonna get you
to a hospital, okay?

24:45.443 --> 24:48.446
Just try to breathe, relax.

24:48.486 --> 24:50.030
It's okay.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.866
(deep breath)

24:52.908 --> 24:55.328
MAN:
Lowest I can go is $800.

24:55.369 --> 24:58.247
$800? Ah, come on.
Sorry, man.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.291
That's the gray-fur variant.
Yeah, I know.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.918
I've been looking
for this since I was 12.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.838
NAVID:
Okay.

25:05.879 --> 25:09.091
What can I say?
I'm a completist.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.470
Navid!

25:12.510 --> 25:13.762
You're here.
Silver.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.764
Yeah, yeah-yeah,
you know me.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.433
I'm, uh... I love
Phenomi-con.

25:17.475 --> 25:19.726
Yeah, um...

25:19.768 --> 25:23.481
I was just telling Liam how
much I missed comic-book Navid.

25:23.521 --> 25:24.898
I... you do?

25:24.940 --> 25:27.567
Yeah, maybe now that
you're taking a day off

25:27.609 --> 25:29.445
from promoting your clubs,
we could hang?

25:29.487 --> 25:31.364
Do you want to go see
the Corporate Invaders

25:31.405 --> 25:33.491
screening with me?
It's about to start.

25:34.950 --> 25:38.412
Oh, no, well, I thought
it was a VIP thing.

25:38.454 --> 25:39.497
Uh, only a few guests.

25:39.537 --> 25:41.123
It's going live on the Web, too.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.583
Oh, it's on the Internet?

25:43.625 --> 25:44.918
Mm-hmm.

25:44.960 --> 25:49.798
Um, will you, uh,
excuse me for a sec?

25:49.840 --> 25:52.176
Sure.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.678
WOMAN:
Is it true you're together
in real life?

25:54.720 --> 25:56.263
Don't believe
everything you read.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.307
What Liam means
to say is:

25:58.349 --> 26:00.934
We'll let our on-screen
chemistry speak for itself.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.853
So you two aren't
really dating?

26:02.895 --> 26:05.563
He's with me.

26:09.443 --> 26:12.654
Um, are you sure
about this?

26:12.696 --> 26:15.449
Yeah, I am.

26:20.204 --> 26:23.249
Hi. Uh, excuse me,
there-there has been

26:23.290 --> 26:25.084
a-a huge mistake.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.420
All right? And, uh,
I need the DVD back.

26:27.461 --> 26:28.421
Sure you do.

26:28.462 --> 26:32.299
Wait, can you
just hear me out?

26:32.341 --> 26:35.761
Okay, it is the moment that
you've all been waiting for.

26:35.802 --> 26:38.347
It is the first ten minutes
of Corporate Invaders 2.

26:38.389 --> 26:39.432
Let's hear it!

26:39.473 --> 26:41.392
(crowd cheering)

26:49.149 --> 26:50.401
Whoo!

26:50.443 --> 26:52.570
There's just a misunderstanding.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.947
Hear me out!
Hear me out!

26:56.740 --> 26:58.909
CROWD:
Whoa!

26:58.951 --> 27:02.162
(crowd cheering)

27:29.940 --> 27:31.233
(crowd cheering)

27:31.275 --> 27:33.277
Lindsey, wait!

27:34.903 --> 27:37.490
You taped us having sex?

27:37.531 --> 27:39.283
No, of course not.
I would never do that.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.951
Then who did?

27:40.993 --> 27:43.454
I have no idea. I...

27:43.496 --> 27:44.497
Maybe it's not that bad.

27:44.538 --> 27:46.039
I mean, it only aired
for a few seconds,

27:46.081 --> 27:48.041
and I don't think
anyone recognized you.
Are you kidding?

27:48.083 --> 27:49.001
It was on the Internet.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.294
The whole world's seen it.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.670
I-I have to get
out of here.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.714
Yeah, you're right.
Let's go.
No.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.468
I do not want to be seen
leaving with you.

27:57.510 --> 27:58.802
Lindsey...

28:00.720 --> 28:02.889
Liam, what the
hell was that?

28:02.931 --> 28:06.810
Uh, apparently someone taped me
having sex with my professor.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.354
By the way, we're dating.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.771
She didn't want
anyone to know.

28:09.813 --> 28:10.981
So much for that.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.816
Who would do that to you?
I don't know.

28:12.858 --> 28:16.028
It was taken the night
of the Pop Up, and I...

28:17.446 --> 28:18.947
Navid?

28:18.989 --> 28:20.115
No.

28:20.157 --> 28:22.075
(gasps)
No, he wouldn't do that.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.916
ADRIANNA:
So how do you feel now?

28:29.958 --> 28:33.462
Uh, okay.

28:33.504 --> 28:35.589
Just my legs
are still numb.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.299
I don't understand.

28:37.341 --> 28:40.052
You were getting better and then
this happens out of nowhere?

28:40.093 --> 28:43.138
My back's been hurting
pretty bad since the Pop Up.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.723
Why didn't you tell me?

28:44.764 --> 28:46.684
(sighs)

28:46.725 --> 28:48.644
I haven't been taking
my pain pills.

28:48.686 --> 28:50.103
Dixon, why?

28:50.145 --> 28:53.399
Because I'm an addict, babe.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.484
I was afraid,
if I started taking them,

28:55.526 --> 28:58.111
I wasn't going
to be able to stop.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.613
WOMAN:
Well, Dixon,

28:59.655 --> 29:01.114
I think we know
what the problem is.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.367
You have an abscess pressing
on your spinal cord.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.078
An abscess?
It's not uncommon when
you're still healing

29:06.119 --> 29:07.079
from a trauma.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.706
You'll be in the
hospital for a few days,

29:08.747 --> 29:09.831
but assuming we can get

29:09.873 --> 29:11.875
the infection under
control, you'll be fine.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.044
You must have been
in tremendous pain.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.754
Get some rest, okay?

29:15.795 --> 29:19.049
So that's why you snapped
at me that night?

29:19.091 --> 29:21.801
You were in pain and
you were trying to hide it.

29:21.843 --> 29:26.139
Yeah. I'm sorry.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.892
I thought it was me getting
in the way of your career.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.228
Look, the only reason why the
Pop Up was so important to me

29:31.270 --> 29:33.063
is because I didn't want
to let you down.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.856
(sighs)

29:34.898 --> 29:37.776
I should have told you
this before, but...

29:40.362 --> 29:42.948
After the accident,
when I woke up

29:42.989 --> 29:49.496
in the hospital, the first thing
I saw was you holding my hand.

29:49.538 --> 29:53.709
And I knew right then and there
that I didn't deserve you.

29:53.751 --> 29:55.586
So I promised myself

29:55.628 --> 29:58.088
that I would earn
my second chance.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.507
That I'd be the man
that you want me to be.

30:00.549 --> 30:04.136
The kind of man that
always puts you first.

30:04.177 --> 30:06.722
Hey, babe.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.641
It's okay.

30:08.682 --> 30:10.809
I'm just glad
you know the truth.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.738
Hey, you in a hurry?

30:22.780 --> 30:24.823
Uh, no, I got
what I came for.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.325
Yeah, I think you did.

30:28.661 --> 30:32.164
Look, I didn't record
that video,

30:32.205 --> 30:33.624
okay?

30:33.666 --> 30:34.792
Someone gave it to me.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.876
I-I didn't want the
whole world to see it.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.044
Just you.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.088
Why?
Because Liam
lied to you.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.840
I wanted you to see
what kind of guy he was

30:41.881 --> 30:42.841
before you
hooked up with him.

30:42.882 --> 30:43.967
Hooked up with him?

30:44.009 --> 30:45.385
What-what are you talking about?

30:45.427 --> 30:46.470
Stop it, Silver.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.971
I know you two have
been getting closer.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.348
As friends.

30:49.389 --> 30:52.017
And the only reason he lied
about his professor

30:52.058 --> 30:54.770
is because she wanted to keep
the relationship a secret.

30:54.812 --> 30:57.564
Wha... Wait.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.191
They're-they're together,
like, for real?

30:59.232 --> 31:00.275
Yeah.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.694
The funny thing is,

31:01.735 --> 31:03.320
Liam's the one
that's been encouraging me

31:03.362 --> 31:05.947
to give you another chance,
and I actually thought about it.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.282
But after all of these years

31:07.324 --> 31:09.451
of saying you'd never get
into the family business,

31:09.493 --> 31:11.370
that's exactly what you've done.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.706
Hey.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.624
You're right.

31:15.666 --> 31:17.376
I-I really messed up.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.753
Yeah, yeah, you did.

31:19.795 --> 31:22.214
I don't even know you anymore.

31:27.927 --> 31:30.096
So, Data Nitrate.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.350
We've got big plans
for the future.

31:33.392 --> 31:37.062
Really... big plans.

31:37.103 --> 31:41.233
Plans, um, I'm quite confident
that you will love.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.901
Dude, when are you gonna
show us something?

31:42.942 --> 31:45.153
Yeah, uh,

31:45.195 --> 31:48.240
well, uh,
I-I could show you something.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.576
But I'm not going to,

31:50.617 --> 31:52.994
and that's because, well,

31:53.036 --> 31:55.831
I-I want you to use
your imagination.

31:55.873 --> 31:56.956
Oh, my God, he's drowning.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.041
This is a disaster.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.252
Yep, and it's your disaster.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.755
Excuse me?

32:02.796 --> 32:05.131
You said it yourself.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.300
You forced Annie to date Colin,

32:07.342 --> 32:08.968
you invited him
to your little hack-a-thon,

32:09.010 --> 32:11.764
and he didn't get my phone
at the Pop Up, did he?

32:11.805 --> 32:13.640
No, as a matter
of fact, he didn't.

32:13.682 --> 32:16.643
He got it from removing your
GPS tracking from my phone.

32:16.685 --> 32:17.770
Oh, wow.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.646
You brought him right in,
didn't you?

32:19.688 --> 32:22.524
Did you give him
Max's ATM pin, too?

32:22.566 --> 32:24.192
Wait a minute.

32:24.234 --> 32:25.736
When you thought
this was your fault,

32:25.778 --> 32:27.446
I covered for you.
I thought we were a team.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.114
It's like I've
been saying.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.533
Max and I are a team,
and you're a mistake.

32:31.575 --> 32:34.202
And I can't wait
to tell him

32:34.244 --> 32:36.204
that this is
all your fault.
Really?

32:36.246 --> 32:37.831
Yes.
(groans)

32:37.873 --> 32:38.749
What are you doing?

32:38.791 --> 32:40.417
NAOMI:
If I'm going down,

32:40.459 --> 32:42.294
I'm taking you with me.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.755
(crowd gasping)

32:44.797 --> 32:46.214
(cheering)

32:49.927 --> 32:52.178
Princess Leia's
kicking that guy's ass.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.228
Sorry about Colin.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.730
Me, too.

33:01.772 --> 33:04.775
It just sucks that I pushed away
somebody I actually care about

33:04.817 --> 33:07.653
because I thought
he was such a nice guy.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.529
Oh, don't beat yourself up.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.658
After what Navid did, I don't
think there's any way to tell

33:12.699 --> 33:14.534
who the nice guys are anymore.

33:15.619 --> 33:16.954
Riley?

33:16.995 --> 33:18.288
What are you doing here?

33:18.330 --> 33:20.332
Hey, Annie, um,

33:20.373 --> 33:22.208
look, it's about Dixon.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.961
Um, I don't want you to worry,

33:24.002 --> 33:27.130
but he has a, uh...
a spinal infection.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.048
He's gonna be in the
hospital for a couple days.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.383
We tried calling you.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.802
(scoffs)
I left my phone in the car.

33:31.844 --> 33:33.261
This stupid costume
doesn't have any pockets.

33:33.303 --> 33:34.847
Is he okay?
No, he's gonna be fine.

33:34.888 --> 33:37.307
Yeah, I just, I thought
you might want to come home,

33:37.349 --> 33:39.351
maybe need a ride.

33:39.392 --> 33:40.853
If not, it's cool.

33:40.894 --> 33:43.188
These sci-fi chicks go
crazy over guys in chairs.

33:43.229 --> 33:45.357
It's like an X-Men thing

33:45.398 --> 33:46.441
or something.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.568
You drove all the way
to Santa Barbara for me?

33:48.610 --> 33:50.612
Yeah.

33:50.654 --> 33:54.032
What a nice guy.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.119
Okay, what was that about there?

33:58.161 --> 34:02.332
Colin turned out to be exactly
what you thought he was.

34:02.374 --> 34:06.085
He was just using me
to steal Max's software.

34:06.127 --> 34:07.504
Wow.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.755
This is the part

34:08.797 --> 34:10.716
where you get to say,
"I told you so."

34:10.757 --> 34:12.300
I feel like an idiot.

34:12.342 --> 34:15.053
No. No, I'm the idiot.

34:15.094 --> 34:18.097
I should have been
honest with you,

34:18.139 --> 34:19.850
told you that I liked you

34:19.891 --> 34:21.685
the first time you yelled
at me in the gym.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.021
Yeah, well, um,

34:24.062 --> 34:27.482
you're not the only one
who hasn't been honest.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.492
Max, this whole thing
was her fault.

34:37.534 --> 34:38.952
She's the one
who brought Colin in.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.453
She's the reason
he got access to my phone.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.496
Only because you
were tracking me.

34:41.538 --> 34:43.248
He was tracking me.
That's because...

34:43.289 --> 34:44.875
Stop! Stop, stop.

34:44.917 --> 34:47.043
Okay, I don't care
whose fault it was.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.127
I really don't.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.463
No, look, all I wanted

34:50.505 --> 34:52.966
was the two most
important people in my life

34:53.007 --> 34:54.551
to get along.

34:55.677 --> 34:56.969
When is this gonna end?

34:57.012 --> 34:59.347
It's not.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.349
I tried.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.977
I really, really tried.

35:04.019 --> 35:07.105
But Alec's been conspiring
to break us apart

35:07.146 --> 35:08.941
since the day
we got married,

35:08.982 --> 35:11.109
and I won't be able
to fight him off forever.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.403
Eventually...

35:13.445 --> 35:14.696
he's gonna win.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.865
What are you saying?

35:16.907 --> 35:21.078
I'm sorry, Max.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.956
You have to choose.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.126
It's him or me.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.181
Did I mention
I like those ears?
Naomi made me do it.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.182
Sure she did.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.350
I feel ridiculous.
Well, well.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.685
Look who it is.

35:45.727 --> 35:47.270
There you are.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.606
You know what, we
should just let it go.

35:49.648 --> 35:50.732
He's not worth it.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.400
You probably already know this
about me,

35:52.442 --> 35:55.821
but, uh, not so good
at letting go.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.572
Hey.

35:57.614 --> 35:59.324
(laughs)

35:59.365 --> 36:01.493
Ah, you've come to defend Annie.

36:01.534 --> 36:03.120
How sweet.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.413
(chuckles)
Yeah, or not.

36:05.455 --> 36:07.332
(grunting)

36:08.541 --> 36:11.419
That was so wrong.

36:11.461 --> 36:13.964
But you like wrong.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.935
Hey, there you are.

36:26.977 --> 36:27.978
Where have you been?

36:28.020 --> 36:29.980
I've been trying to
call you all night.

36:30.022 --> 36:32.482
Yeah, I-I turned my phone off.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.733
I needed some time to think.

36:33.775 --> 36:37.029
Look, I know that things
are crazy right now,

36:37.070 --> 36:38.655
but eventually, this
is gonna blow over.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.990
Maybe for you.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.575
But even if administration
doesn't fire me

36:42.617 --> 36:44.369
for being in a sex tape,

36:44.410 --> 36:46.204
how am I ever supposed to stand

36:46.245 --> 36:48.581
in front of a class full
of college students again?

36:48.623 --> 36:50.249
My academic career

36:50.291 --> 36:51.918
is over.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.796
And so are we.

36:54.838 --> 36:57.632
Lindsey, don't do this.

36:57.674 --> 37:01.094
I really like you,

37:01.136 --> 37:03.889
but you lead a very public life.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.766
And even if our relationship
didn't have

37:06.808 --> 37:09.728
all these other complications,

37:09.769 --> 37:12.689
it's not the kind
of life I want.

37:20.197 --> 37:23.033
(sighs)

37:31.666 --> 37:33.001
Hey.

37:33.043 --> 37:34.377
Hi.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.962
How did it go?

37:36.004 --> 37:38.464
Dixon's had a setback.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.259
He's back at the hospital
for a few days.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.386
I couldn't tell him.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.935
You know what I think?

37:51.228 --> 37:52.938
You still love him.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.023
Maybe.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.192
(groans)

37:57.234 --> 37:58.902
I don't know.
I'm confused.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.029
I'm not.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.665
I can't do this anymore.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.335
(whispers):
Okay.

38:16.377 --> 38:19.380
Dixon's a lucky guy.

38:19.422 --> 38:22.092
I just hope he knows that.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.855
What do you want?

38:38.233 --> 38:41.111
Liam, uh...

38:41.153 --> 38:43.404
I-I'm really sorry.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.490
You can kick my ass
if you want.

38:45.531 --> 38:47.826
You can even tape it
and put it on the Internet.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.662
Trust me, it...
I would feel a lot better.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.841
What are you doing?

39:02.882 --> 39:06.052
This is for everything
that you put into the club.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.471
Liam, please.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry.

39:08.513 --> 39:09.973
Get the hell out.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.933
If I ever see you in here again,

39:11.975 --> 39:14.019
I will kick your ass.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.320
(sighs)

39:23.361 --> 39:25.989
Good news-- our lawyers...

39:31.077 --> 39:34.706
Our lawyers think we can hit
Colin with an infringement suit.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.751
Why is she here?

39:41.129 --> 39:42.881
Max, come on.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.841
I know things got
out of hand at Phenomi-con.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.134
I'm sorry.

39:46.176 --> 39:47.760
It's too late for that, Alec.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.595
So you're choosing
her over me?

39:49.637 --> 39:51.097
Look, I asked you two

39:51.139 --> 39:52.849
to find a way to make it work.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.893
She tried; you didn't.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.229
Well, you can't fire me.

39:57.270 --> 39:59.105
Not without approval
of the board.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.440
I'm not firing you.

40:01.482 --> 40:04.736
I'm asking you to resign.

40:06.696 --> 40:08.156
You have to buy me out.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.242
It'll cost you a fortune.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.329
Good thing I married well.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.127
Alec...

40:21.169 --> 40:22.628
Congratulations.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.005
Looks like you won.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.049
I didn't want it
to be like this.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.260
Yeah, you keep telling
yourself that.

40:36.017 --> 40:37.810
Baby, I know it's hard.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.189
It's for the best.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.816
It just doesn't feel that way.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.277
It feels
like our marriage

40:45.318 --> 40:47.653
just cost me my best friend.
