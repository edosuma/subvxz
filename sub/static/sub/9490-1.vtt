01:36.421 --> 01:42.008
I think your bookkeeper
paid for the flatware twice.

01:42.177 --> 01:46.340
Albert, stop.
I can't do this any more.

01:46.514 --> 01:49.432
Mollie, I love you and you love me.

01:49.601 --> 01:54.309
Albert, you're great in bed
and you're my biggest account . . .

01:54.480 --> 01:56.888
. . . but you're married!

01:57.066 --> 02:03.484
And I'll never fall in love with
anyone else while I'm seeing you.

02:03.656 --> 02:07.784
You know I'm leaving Beth.
It just takes time.

02:07.952 --> 02:14.488
Every time I say the word divorce,
she loses five pounds.

02:14.667 --> 02:18.000
I'm sorry she's bulimic.

02:18.170 --> 02:22.666
- I can't wait for you forever.
- It's going to work out soon.

02:22.841 --> 02:29.211
The doctor prescribed new pills
and she's starting ballet classes.

02:29.389 --> 02:35.890
- It'll be like the playwriting.
- She knows this can't make her fat.

02:36.062 --> 02:39.562
She said
writing made her ass spread.

02:39.733 --> 02:44.560
Which is insane, she's got
a great ass for a 40-year-old.

02:44.738 --> 02:48.984
I'll tell Mr. Ross to give
your account to someone else.

02:49.159 --> 02:56.039
I won't let him. I'll never let
anyone else touch my books.

03:00.128 --> 03:07.126
God, Mollie, I'm going to burst
if you don't kiss me soon.

03:46.882 --> 03:52.836
Follow me. I know where I'm going.
I've got the map. Come on.

03:53.013 --> 03:59.098
Come on, keep up, you kids.
Here we go.

04:00.061 --> 04:03.893
Wait a minute, I see something.

04:04.065 --> 04:07.564
I think this is it,
right over here.

04:07.735 --> 04:12.278
This is definitely it.
This is the place.

04:12.448 --> 04:15.022
Jackpot!

04:15.201 --> 04:20.575
Right down here, kids.
Here we go.

04:23.417 --> 04:28.708
Dig in, you kids. Here we go.

04:28.881 --> 04:32.297
It's kind of tough here.

04:33.177 --> 04:37.673
Oh, oh . . .

04:37.848 --> 04:40.849
I'm in!

05:08.628 --> 05:12.791
Are you okay?

05:12.966 --> 05:16.299
- I broke up with George.
- Who?

05:16.469 --> 05:24.263
George. I met him in Joe Allen's.
He turned out to be stupid.

05:29.065 --> 05:33.643
You look lousy, doll.

05:33.819 --> 05:39.904
- Stomach flu. It's going around.
- Nobody has the stomach flu.

05:40.075 --> 05:43.943
They don't?
You want to hear about Albert?

05:44.121 --> 05:47.869
- Listen to me.
- I am.

05:48.041 --> 05:53.202
Albert's shrink said his wife would
never recover if he kept seeing me.

05:53.380 --> 05:57.841
- He's decided to leave her.
- Albert's leaving his wife?

05:58.009 --> 06:04.511
No, he's leaving his shrink. She was
really an obstacle between us.

06:04.683 --> 06:08.846
Leaving his shrink?
He's supposed to leave his wife.

06:09.020 --> 06:15.604
He's going to. He can't leave her
while she's sick. She's bulimic.

06:16.569 --> 06:21.397
Don't give me that look.
It's a very serious disease.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.813
What in the . . . Wait a minute.

06:56.984 --> 07:00.898
I've got two of these things.
Look at that, they match.

07:01.071 --> 07:06.776
- You ate all that already?
- How weird, I don't like ice cream.

07:06.952 --> 07:11.364
- There he is.
- This is sick.

07:11.539 --> 07:16.700
He looks so sweet with the kids.
If only Beth would stop throwing up.

07:16.878 --> 07:22.881
Miss Popularity, you can't expect to
find a husband if you never go out.

07:23.051 --> 07:27.878
- You're in every night of the week.
- Ma, it's tax season.

07:28.056 --> 07:31.259
I was studying to pass a CPA exam, -

07:31.434 --> 07:36.262
- and I still managed
to catch your father.

07:38.524 --> 07:42.438
What if Daddy was married
when you first met him?

07:42.611 --> 07:46.063
- I wouldn't have fallen for him.
- You can't control that.

07:46.240 --> 07:51.068
Why not?
Listen, take your father here . . .

07:51.245 --> 07:56.322
His favourite food was cheesecake,
and what did the doctor tell him?

07:56.500 --> 08:01.921
- "Cut back on cholesterol."
- Now he doesn't eat cheesecake.

08:02.089 --> 08:05.754
Ma, that doesn't make any sense.

08:05.926 --> 08:10.137
You never used to like my food.
Something's wrong.

08:10.305 --> 08:13.639
- Nothing's wrong.
- Louie, something's wrong.

08:13.809 --> 08:17.758
- I didn't eat breakfast.
- Something's wrong.

08:23.651 --> 08:26.107
No.

08:28.823 --> 08:30.899
Oh, no!

08:31.075 --> 08:34.943
- Yes!
- Oh, no!

08:35.121 --> 08:40.791
- This wasn't a planned pregnancy?
- This wasn't even a planned affair.

08:40.960 --> 08:45.456
Well . . .
Iet's see how far along we are.

08:50.302 --> 08:56.257
Time out! Holy cow,
what was that? Who's that?

08:56.433 --> 08:59.683
How could this have happened?

08:59.853 --> 09:04.515
- How old are you now, Mollie?
- 33.

09:04.691 --> 09:08.985
Remember,
your biological clock is ticking.

09:19.164 --> 09:24.620
Beth finally agreed to a divorce.
Mollie, I'm so glad you waited.

09:24.794 --> 09:29.955
I knew if I was patient,
this day would come.

09:34.137 --> 09:37.387
Remember your biological clock.

09:54.782 --> 09:58.068
My biological clock is ticking . . .

09:58.244 --> 10:01.992
I know, I've already said that.
I didn't plan on this.

10:02.164 --> 10:06.078
I'm not asking for anything.
I don't want to trap you.

10:06.252 --> 10:12.005
But this baby . . . it's you and
me, and I'm not getting an abortion.

10:12.174 --> 10:18.461
I wasn't going to ask you to.
This will be an incredible baby.

10:18.639 --> 10:24.262
He'll have your sweet face
and my business sense.

10:24.436 --> 10:29.062
- We'll get little Armani diapers.
- It will be a great kid.

10:29.232 --> 10:33.312
Having my baby
what a way to say you love me

10:33.486 --> 10:38.113
Albert, you're making me sick.
I hate that song.

10:38.908 --> 10:42.858
Stop singing.
She gets sick, I get sick.

10:43.037 --> 10:46.620
What are you going to tell people?

10:46.791 --> 10:49.792
That I got artificially inseminated.

10:49.961 --> 10:55.666
What?
How could you do such a thing?

10:55.842 --> 11:00.053
I went to the clinic
and bought some frozen sperm.

11:00.221 --> 11:06.259
- I inserted it, now I'm pregnant.
- Where's the frozen pop?

11:06.435 --> 11:12.271
- There's no frozen pop.
- There's no husband.

11:12.441 --> 11:16.225
I control my life
and I want to have a baby.

11:16.403 --> 11:20.982
This kind of thing a girl does
if she's very ugly or a lesbian.

11:21.158 --> 11:25.784
This is not the act
of a beautiful intelligent girl.

11:25.954 --> 11:30.415
You never liked
any of my boyfriends, anyway.

11:30.584 --> 11:35.542
- Where did this sperm come from?
- A medical student.

11:35.714 --> 11:40.174
He goes to Columbia.
His parents live on the lsland.

11:40.343 --> 11:44.804
His father's in piece goods.
His mother works in cosmetics.

11:44.973 --> 11:48.757
So you're making fun of me.
Wait, you'll see.

11:48.935 --> 11:52.635
Someday you'll have children.

12:05.076 --> 12:10.117
Look . . . an arm. It's an arm.

12:10.289 --> 12:16.374
Look . . . isn't it cute?

12:34.855 --> 12:39.398
Here's the head . . . isn't it?

12:53.123 --> 12:56.242
Get some apple juice down here!

13:03.925 --> 13:06.498
- Thirsty?
- Go ahead.

13:08.054 --> 13:12.301
"The sex organs are moulded
out of similar tissue folds."

13:12.475 --> 13:16.603
"By the second trimester
they are identifiable."

13:16.771 --> 13:20.436
Look, another arm
coming in down there . . .

13:20.608 --> 13:25.068
How am I going to get that
in my mouth?

13:27.364 --> 13:31.362
Miss, excuse me . . .

13:32.453 --> 13:36.035
- What can I do for you?
- Albert is expecting me.

13:36.206 --> 13:42.161
He's in with his decorator.
You can wait over there.

13:47.300 --> 13:50.835
- I think you're going to enjoy it.
- I'm sure I will.

13:51.012 --> 13:55.306
- Remember to dust it every day.
- See you later.

13:55.475 --> 13:59.010
Hi, come on in.

14:08.905 --> 14:12.071
Albert, was that woman pretty?

14:12.241 --> 14:17.236
- No, you're pretty.
- I look like a big, fat pilgrim.

14:17.413 --> 14:20.948
How do you like the desk?

14:21.125 --> 14:25.205
- It's made of stone.
- It's all right.

14:25.379 --> 14:29.958
It's going to be great in here.
This is all going.

14:30.134 --> 14:34.712
I'm having a custom-made mural
of an ancient Navajo design.

14:34.889 --> 14:39.681
Leather craftsmen in Mexico
are going to make all new couches.

14:42.312 --> 14:47.140
- What do you think?
- I like the deco stuff.

14:47.317 --> 14:52.656
- Don't gain too much weight.
- My doctor says my weight is fine.

14:52.823 --> 14:59.703
Beth only gained 21 pounds.
She jogged three miles a day.

14:59.871 --> 15:03.572
- Maybe you should marry her.
- Don't start.

15:03.750 --> 15:10.168
- I've got problems, too.
- Sorry. I'm afraid of giving birth.

15:10.340 --> 15:14.587
- I've never been real big on pain.
- You been to Lamaze?

15:14.761 --> 15:18.426
I quit.
It's just a bunch of breathing.

15:18.598 --> 15:22.845
It's so much better for the baby.
When Beth had Priscilla . . .

15:23.019 --> 15:27.063
I'm so sick of hearing about Beth!

15:27.231 --> 15:31.560
How could you be in love with her
and then in love with me?

15:31.736 --> 15:35.235
I have a degree.
She took belly-dancing lessons.

15:35.406 --> 15:41.029
When I found out I was pregnant,
I decided to make out a will.

15:41.203 --> 15:46.410
When Beth had the girls, she had
a reading of their past lives.

15:46.583 --> 15:53.202
- And you're still with her!
- Oh yeah? Look at this receipt.

15:53.382 --> 15:57.379
- Galleria Apartments.
- I moved out. I did it.

15:57.552 --> 16:00.719
I put down a deposit this morning.

16:02.140 --> 16:05.675
I can't believe it!
Should I come by tonight?

16:05.852 --> 16:09.720
You'd better not.
We've still got to be careful.

16:09.898 --> 16:14.394
Albert, I'm so happy!

16:17.071 --> 16:23.323
I wonder if this store
has a bathroom. I have to go again.

16:25.580 --> 16:30.407
I love this . . . Look,
it takes two of them to cover me.

16:30.585 --> 16:34.665
- Yeah, but you're having a baby.
- You try it on.

16:34.839 --> 16:39.335
- Should I have a baby with Neal?
- Do you love him?

16:39.510 --> 16:42.345
No.

16:42.513 --> 16:48.302
Try some of that
Nobel Prize winners' sperm.

16:48.477 --> 16:51.597
Don't you want a smart baby?

16:51.772 --> 16:57.810
That's all I need. A baby
telling me what an idiot I am.

16:57.986 --> 17:03.692
- I found a nice family man.
- Except it's someone else's family.

17:03.867 --> 17:08.694
That's why he left.
He loves me and we're having baby.

17:08.872 --> 17:14.115
It sounds like the people
in the next compartment are.

17:25.472 --> 17:27.594
- Mollie!
- Albert!

17:27.765 --> 17:33.270
- Let me explain . . .
- These dresses aren't paid for.

17:33.438 --> 17:39.440
- Don't take this shit from him.
- I'm going to call the cops.

17:39.610 --> 17:42.362
After you. Thank you.

17:42.530 --> 17:46.824
- Albert, what's going on?
- Mollie, I've fallen in love.

17:46.993 --> 17:50.824
Beth knows.
I'm going to live with Melissa.

17:50.996 --> 17:55.991
I don't know if it'll last.
It just happened.

17:56.168 --> 17:59.418
Why didn't you say anything to me?

17:59.588 --> 18:03.538
You were so close
to the end of your pregnancy.

18:03.717 --> 18:06.504
I don't believe this is happening.

18:06.678 --> 18:11.221
This sounds awful, but
I'm going through a selfish phase.

18:11.391 --> 18:15.555
- A selfish phase?
- I admit the timing is bad.

18:15.729 --> 18:19.809
- A selfish phase?
- It just happened.

18:19.983 --> 18:24.230
A selfish phase!
Albert, you dick.

18:24.404 --> 18:29.481
- You lousy prick!
- Leave him alone.

18:29.659 --> 18:33.408
- Come on.
- Here.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.534
Hey, what the . . .

18:37.375 --> 18:42.535
- Wait, please, I'm in labour.
- I was here first.

18:43.965 --> 18:48.876
Asshole! Taxi! Please . . .

18:54.975 --> 18:58.179
St. Jerome's Hospital.

18:59.021 --> 19:01.642
Oh, shit!

19:05.277 --> 19:11.113
- Slow down! It can take hours.
- So can the midtown traffic.

19:21.251 --> 19:24.086
Pull over till the ludes wear off.

19:28.550 --> 19:31.504
God, you idiot!

19:31.678 --> 19:35.378
Come on, move it.

19:37.434 --> 19:43.388
Christ, this traffic . . .
We're going as fast as we can.

19:44.524 --> 19:49.351
Hold onto my hand. Bear down, that's
what they say in the hospital.

19:50.905 --> 19:56.611
- Come on, move it.
- God, my water just broke.

19:56.786 --> 20:02.290
- Hey, buddy, move it.
- You can't get through here.

20:02.458 --> 20:06.835
- I've got an emergency.
- Sorry, buddy, move it.

20:10.674 --> 20:14.921
Just relax.
Hold on, we're almost there.

20:15.095 --> 20:18.429
Look out! You're going to hit . . !

20:22.686 --> 20:26.019
Hold on!

20:28.066 --> 20:30.984
You stupid son of a . . !

20:32.487 --> 20:35.571
- Are you doing your Lamaze?
- Look out!

20:39.369 --> 20:43.698
- Breathe deep.
- Don't try to help, just drive!

20:45.125 --> 20:48.908
You've got to use Lamaze.
My sister-in-law used it.

20:49.087 --> 20:53.464
- It's better for the kid.
- All men are stupid idiots.

20:55.134 --> 21:00.176
- Should I call your husband?
- I don't have a husband.

21:00.348 --> 21:04.511
- I was artificially inseminated.
- Are you a lesbo?

21:21.827 --> 21:27.699
Stupid jerk! My kid will probably
be brain damaged because of you.

21:29.501 --> 21:34.044
Don't touch me! I'll have this baby
without you touching me.

21:36.049 --> 21:41.007
- Excuse me, I'm in labour.
- Do you have your medical card?

21:41.179 --> 21:46.090
- I left it at home.
- I have to have your medical card.

21:46.268 --> 21:51.510
- This is my first baby.
- She's getting close. Upstairs.

21:51.689 --> 21:56.731
You didn't finish this.
I cannot do my job . . .

21:56.903 --> 22:03.404
- Put these on over your clothes.
- I'm not the father.

22:03.576 --> 22:09.661
- Nurse, another one's coming.
- Deep breaths, come on.

22:09.832 --> 22:13.166
Okay, this'll pass. Watch the head.

22:13.336 --> 22:17.547
God! I need some drugs.

22:17.715 --> 22:22.211
- Slow down your breathing.
- Fuck my breathing!

22:22.386 --> 22:27.926
- You've got to calm down.
- Get me some drugs.

22:28.100 --> 22:32.976
- No, you don't want drugs.
- I do. I'm going to split in two.

22:33.147 --> 22:37.643
By the time they
take effect she could be delivering.

22:37.818 --> 22:42.943
- But what about now?
- I'm waiting for a doctor.

22:44.700 --> 22:49.242
Are you a doctor? Come on.

22:51.873 --> 22:55.918
- Water break?
- Half an hour ago.

22:56.086 --> 23:01.542
- Are we doing our Lamaze breathing?
- I dropped out of Lamaze.

23:01.716 --> 23:05.761
I'll go to summer school
if you make the pain stop.

23:05.929 --> 23:10.637
- How about some Demerol?
- God, that'd be great!

23:10.808 --> 23:15.803
I'd like some of that.
Give me a lot of it.

23:15.980 --> 23:19.349
So it doesn't wear off
during the birth.

23:19.525 --> 23:25.563
I think maybe I'm in a bit more pain
than most of your patients.

23:25.740 --> 23:29.191
Be sure and give me enough.

23:29.368 --> 23:34.824
- There we go.
- Thank you a really lot.

23:34.999 --> 23:39.079
That is a little more like it.

23:39.253 --> 23:43.250
Hey, here's Mr. Hand here.

23:44.508 --> 23:49.798
Now that is very cosmic.
I don't understand . . .

23:49.971 --> 23:54.598
What's that light down there?

23:55.811 --> 23:59.594
That's it, breathe!

23:59.773 --> 24:04.518
Attagirl, push. One more.

24:04.694 --> 24:08.906
Stop with that pushing!
I'm falling!

24:14.537 --> 24:16.660
Help!

24:16.831 --> 24:22.952
No, put me back in! Let go
of my head and put me back inside!

24:23.129 --> 24:25.205
It's a boy.

24:25.381 --> 24:28.298
It's a boy.

24:28.467 --> 24:33.710
Who are you?
Lady, I'm freezing. I'm so cold.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.590
Get that thing away from me.

24:37.768 --> 24:41.932
- You want to do the cord?
- No, you take this one.

24:42.106 --> 24:45.475
I need that!

24:45.651 --> 24:50.562
Lady, a blanket,
something, I'm frosty out here.

24:53.450 --> 24:57.317
No, don't do that!

25:00.332 --> 25:05.373
Where are we going now?
Hey, don't drop me.

25:05.545 --> 25:10.503
Oh, very nice . . .

25:17.974 --> 25:21.806
I don't know about you,
but I'm beat.

25:21.978 --> 25:25.762
So you're the one
that's been kicking me.

25:25.940 --> 25:29.558
You're the one
that ate the spicy food.

25:32.154 --> 25:37.990
This is the weirdest thing that's
ever happened to me . . . so far.

25:41.163 --> 25:47.166
I don't get it. I just don't
get it. Where did I go wrong?

25:47.336 --> 25:52.959
Where are my thumbs?
I want to suck my thumbs.

25:53.133 --> 25:58.887
- I have to get my own place.
- I've been reincarnated so quickly?

25:59.056 --> 26:02.507
What a surprise!

26:02.684 --> 26:07.476
Who stole my sucking thing?
I need my sucking thing!

26:07.647 --> 26:10.851
I just remembered
I hate childhood.

26:19.701 --> 26:22.737
Look at all those daddies.

26:22.912 --> 26:29.710
Making goofball faces
and taking pictures of their babies.

26:29.877 --> 26:32.997
You won't find your father here.

26:33.172 --> 26:37.004
I really messed things up for you.

26:37.176 --> 26:42.467
Don't be upset.
I'm going to find you a daddy.

26:42.640 --> 26:46.590
And not just some handsome guy
I'm in love with.

26:46.769 --> 26:54.065
You're all that matters to me.
I'll get you the best daddy ever.

26:58.322 --> 27:05.404
Out, down, in, out . . .
Well, we got that.

27:05.579 --> 27:08.995
What have you got there?
A hand?

27:09.166 --> 27:12.202
Yeah, two of them.

27:20.135 --> 27:23.254
Oh, my God!

27:29.894 --> 27:33.974
"On the third or fourth day
your breasts may swell slightly."

27:34.148 --> 27:38.810
Slightly?
I look like a Russ Meyer movie.

27:46.077 --> 27:49.031
Workman.

27:49.205 --> 27:54.282
- Oh, no! Sorry.
- Real nice.

27:56.087 --> 28:01.044
- You got your figure back.
- This is not my figure.

28:01.217 --> 28:05.428
Sorry I hit you and yelled at you,
but I was in a lot of pain.

28:05.596 --> 28:11.681
I still owe you that cab fare,
but somebody stole my purse.

28:11.852 --> 28:16.348
- How do you like New York so far?
- It's my kind of town.

28:16.523 --> 28:22.312
I'll get you the rest later . . .
Wait a minute . . .

28:22.487 --> 28:27.908
- How did you know where I lived?
- You left it in the cab.

28:29.452 --> 28:31.362
Thanks.

28:31.538 --> 28:36.663
You should look through that thing.
You've still got your diaphragm.

28:42.590 --> 28:45.757
Don't smoke that around my baby.

28:45.927 --> 28:51.301
There's a 62% higher rate of cancer
in people who live with smokers.

28:51.474 --> 28:56.848
What are you trying to say?
You don't want me to move in yet?

28:57.021 --> 29:01.599
Do you think the drugs
had any effect on him?

29:01.776 --> 29:06.105
- How did you know I had drugs?
- I don't. I didn't.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.613
You can tell in his eyes.
He looks stoned.

29:09.783 --> 29:17.529
- He does not. He looks perfect.
- You don't look so hot yourself.

29:17.708 --> 29:23.876
If you tried passing a watermelon,
how hot would you look?

29:24.047 --> 29:28.424
Ouch! I should call
my mother more often. Get it?

29:28.593 --> 29:33.504
- Do you want a sub?
- No, will you just watch him?

29:33.682 --> 29:39.138
Don't take him out of his chair
and don't touch him a whole lot.

29:40.522 --> 29:43.095
Hi, Mikey. I'm James.

29:43.274 --> 29:49.526
- Good to meet you.
- Do you mind if I suck on that?

29:49.697 --> 29:56.495
- How long have you been here?
- About five years.

29:56.662 --> 30:03.744
- Were you born in New York?
- Are you with the census bureau?

30:03.920 --> 30:11.167
How do you like the outside world?
It's weird, isn't it?

30:11.343 --> 30:17.346
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- Here, your first lesson in coffee.

30:17.516 --> 30:22.676
- Can you say black coffee?
- No.

30:22.855 --> 30:28.359
Regular coffee has two sugars and
milk . . . which they have forgotten.

30:28.527 --> 30:35.692
Can I borrow some of yours?
Coffee regular, I love it.

30:35.867 --> 30:39.319
That's breast milk.

30:40.539 --> 30:44.536
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You're on your own.

30:44.709 --> 30:47.794
I'll see you guys later.

30:47.962 --> 30:54.546
I'm going to take my sub and
my breast milk and get out of here.

30:54.719 --> 30:58.882
I've got something
cold and wet in my shorts.

30:59.057 --> 31:04.051
Could you get somebody for me?
Fellas?

31:04.228 --> 31:10.646
You guys are no help. I'm cold and
wet and there's nothing I can do.

31:10.818 --> 31:15.776
It's okay, Mikey. Mommy's here.

31:15.948 --> 31:21.404
That Mommy person's here again.
She's okay. I like her.

31:23.914 --> 31:28.457
I start crying
and she comes in with a bottle.

31:28.627 --> 31:31.747
Crying, I can handle that.

32:14.839 --> 32:17.756
Taxi!

32:20.803 --> 32:24.219
Taxi!

32:44.201 --> 32:49.824
"80% of all women experience
post-partum depression."

32:49.998 --> 32:52.074
I won't.

32:55.337 --> 33:01.256
Like a lot of parents, I can't
always be there on birthdays.

33:01.426 --> 33:07.464
Help, somebody burp me
before I blow up.

33:07.640 --> 33:15.980
That's it! You have some exotic
disease and I look like a zombie.

33:16.149 --> 33:21.391
And your father deserted us so he
could pork his interior decorator.

33:21.571 --> 33:25.782
I think you can safely say
that it can't get any worse.

33:25.950 --> 33:30.825
- Hello!
- I was wrong.

33:30.996 --> 33:36.038
Where's my grandson?

33:36.210 --> 33:38.748
There he is.

33:40.964 --> 33:47.050
- Mikey, do you know who I am?
- No, actually, I don't.

33:47.221 --> 33:52.048
- I'm your grandma.
- Okay, if you say so.

33:52.225 --> 33:55.725
- Yes, I am.
- What do you want from me?

33:59.441 --> 34:03.853
- Who's got a wet tushy?
- I give up.

34:08.616 --> 34:13.112
After a new diaper, I like
some of that white stuff on me.

34:13.288 --> 34:18.364
If you had a man instead of a frozen
pop, all this would be put together.

34:18.543 --> 34:23.668
You make it sound like I had
an affair with a frozen dessert.

34:23.840 --> 34:27.672
- You look awful.
- Thank you.

34:27.844 --> 34:30.963
You're using too much powder.

34:31.138 --> 34:37.473
Why don't you get out of the house?
I'm going to give Mikey a bath.

34:37.645 --> 34:40.217
A what?

34:42.483 --> 34:44.725
She's gone!

34:52.576 --> 34:56.621
Who would you want
as your child's father?

34:56.788 --> 35:00.537
Someone with a small mouth
and good hair . . .

35:00.709 --> 35:07.210
- A guy to help raise your child.
- Are there men who do that?

35:07.382 --> 35:12.174
I'm looking for a guy
who's not married, -

35:12.345 --> 35:17.422
- not into drugs, not a deadbeat,
but not a workaholic.

35:17.600 --> 35:23.888
- And cute.
- Cute is of no importance.

35:24.065 --> 35:26.852
You're my first date
since my baby was born.

35:27.026 --> 35:30.644
This looks delicious.

35:30.822 --> 35:36.064
What is this?
I asked for well done. This is raw.

35:36.244 --> 35:40.407
I asked for no dressing,
this is covered with slop.

35:40.581 --> 35:46.536
Are you deaf or something?
Who do I have to kill to get a roll?

35:46.712 --> 35:53.842
What's this "C" in algebra?
How many times did we go over it?

35:54.011 --> 35:56.632
Are you an idiot?

35:56.805 --> 36:04.101
Dating is difficult, but you've got
to take a chance in life sometime.

36:04.271 --> 36:08.351
I'm not so sure about that.
Excuse me.

36:08.525 --> 36:14.777
This fork and this plate are dirty,
and there's something in the water.

36:14.948 --> 36:17.735
Check your water.

36:17.909 --> 36:24.493
Mikey, what is this mess?
Sort out these socks.

36:24.666 --> 36:29.126
Why are school shirts
mixed up with after-school shirts?

36:29.295 --> 36:32.166
Straighten this up properly.

36:39.597 --> 36:42.384
- Hi.
- Hey.

36:42.558 --> 36:46.852
- Somebody call for a cab?
- Yeah, small world.

36:47.021 --> 36:51.398
More mail for Vincent Ubriacco.
I don't even know this guy.

36:51.567 --> 36:56.941
Let me have them. Put them up here,
the postman will take care of them.

36:57.114 --> 37:03.651
- It's good seeing you again.
- You, too. See you.

37:07.249 --> 37:11.578
- You're stealing my mail!
- I'm not stealing your mail.

37:11.753 --> 37:15.621
- You put it in your pocket!
- These are mine.

37:15.799 --> 37:21.138
- I sent them here. I'll explain.
- I'm going to call the police.

37:21.304 --> 37:25.468
My grandfather Vincent
needs an old-age home -

37:25.642 --> 37:31.762
- and there's a place in Manhattan,
but he needs to be a resident.

37:31.940 --> 37:35.059
You want to use my mailing address?

37:35.235 --> 37:41.024
I could have you arrested. Screwing
with the mail is a federal offence.

37:41.199 --> 37:45.031
Stealing mail is,
not screwing with it.

37:45.203 --> 37:50.707
- Can I get the other letters?
- No, I don't want to get involved.

37:50.875 --> 37:55.667
I went out of my way
to bring you back your purse.

37:55.838 --> 38:01.294
Thank you very much,
but this happens to be illegal.

38:01.469 --> 38:06.676
You're not going to get caught.
I'll do something for you, okay.

38:06.849 --> 38:10.763
- I'll baby-sit.
- Come on . . .

38:10.936 --> 38:16.096
- You don't know about babies.
- My sister has kids.

38:16.275 --> 38:21.020
- I know a lot about babies.
- All right, Friday night.

38:21.196 --> 38:26.819
- No can do, Friday's out.
- Then forget the whole deal.

38:26.993 --> 38:32.617
- Okay, Friday, but that's it.
- And during my aerobics classes.

38:32.791 --> 38:36.041
- One aerobics class.
- Saturday.

38:36.211 --> 38:38.666
Can't do. I teach.

38:38.838 --> 38:42.124
What do you teach?
Taxi driver's ed?

38:42.300 --> 38:46.132
- That's not funny.
- Here's the deal.

38:46.304 --> 38:51.725
Friday nights, two aerobics classes,
and you can't bring chicks over.

38:51.893 --> 38:56.555
You're pushing it.
All right, it's a deal.

38:56.731 --> 38:59.732
- Sucker.
- Good.

38:59.901 --> 39:04.194
- Don't force-feed him like that.
- I'm not!

39:04.363 --> 39:09.737
- Why don't you take a nap?
- He doesn't need a nap.

39:09.910 --> 39:14.537
- He knows when he's tired.
- I'm not tired at all.

39:15.708 --> 39:19.326
If he doesn't take a nap -

39:19.503 --> 39:24.414
- he will wake up and want
to eat when it's time to sleep.

39:24.591 --> 39:28.256
- Who says?
- All those doctors.

39:28.428 --> 39:33.304
- They just want to sell books.
- Dr. Spock is not like that.

39:33.475 --> 39:38.516
Dr. Spock loves us. He protested
during the Vietnam war.

39:38.688 --> 39:42.900
I'm sorry I said anything
about Dr. Spock.

39:43.068 --> 39:47.694
I can't believe she's getting
upset about a Vulcan.

39:47.864 --> 39:54.661
- Have you got any other letters?
- They're in the hallway.

40:07.967 --> 40:11.881
Mommy's asleep. Watch this.

40:39.164 --> 40:44.289
What do you say you and me take
a ride so your mother can sleep?

40:44.461 --> 40:50.879
- Is that a deal?
- Just bring the milk.

40:51.051 --> 40:55.262
See that? That's my cab.

40:55.430 --> 41:00.092
I do this to make money,
but not for long.

41:04.188 --> 41:08.103
Okay, this is called driving.

41:08.276 --> 41:12.487
When you get older,
I'll teach you how.

41:12.655 --> 41:17.400
First, you put the little stick
in the hole.

41:17.576 --> 41:21.954
Then you move your foot
back and forth. Okay, what next?

41:22.123 --> 41:24.993
You move the big circle around.

41:25.167 --> 41:29.544
No problem, I can do this.
I can drive.

41:51.359 --> 41:55.108
- Hey.
- Hey, Jimmy.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.565
That silver plane is a VJ-1 0.

41:58.742 --> 42:01.778
That big plane is a Viscount.

42:01.953 --> 42:05.998
- Hey, Carrie.
- What a sweetie.

42:06.166 --> 42:09.748
- Is it yours?
- Yeah, but he needs a mother.

42:11.421 --> 42:15.714
I'm kidding. Is this my schedule?

42:15.883 --> 42:21.423
- There's nothing on it.
- I'm sorry.

42:21.597 --> 42:26.555
Do these things come in different
sizes? What are these, jumbos?

42:26.727 --> 42:32.066
- What are you staring at?
- Lunch.

42:36.820 --> 42:39.738
Mikey?

42:42.076 --> 42:45.326
Mikey?

42:55.756 --> 43:00.880
I want to report a missing baby.

43:01.052 --> 43:05.761
Maybe he was kidnapped,
or maybe he's with a complete idiot!

43:05.932 --> 43:08.933
Hey, Grandpa.

43:09.102 --> 43:11.675
That's Grandpa.

43:11.855 --> 43:14.974
Do I know you?

43:23.324 --> 43:26.740
- Jimmy!
- Grandpa.

43:26.911 --> 43:32.118
- I don't remember your baby.
- It's a friend of mine's.

43:32.291 --> 43:36.953
- You sure it isn't yours?
- I've got more teeth than him.

43:37.129 --> 43:41.756
What are those hairy jobs
over your eyes?

43:41.926 --> 43:46.587
Let me see those things.
There we go. How does that feel?

43:46.764 --> 43:51.758
- Mikey, lay off him.
- What a crack-up.

43:52.895 --> 43:55.931
- Honey, I'm home.
- Me, too.

43:56.106 --> 44:03.484
- Hey, you're up.
- My baby! Honey, honey . . .

44:03.655 --> 44:06.775
Mommy and her baby . . .

44:08.577 --> 44:13.120
Idiot! I called the police.
I was worried out of my mind.

44:13.289 --> 44:18.414
- You knew I was with him.
- You might be a kidnapper.

44:18.586 --> 44:23.663
- I was baby-sitting for you.
- That means the baby stays here!

44:23.841 --> 44:26.795
Damn it! I got a splinter.

44:26.969 --> 44:30.006
Let me see it.

44:30.181 --> 44:34.594
- Have you got a needle?
- In there.

44:37.188 --> 44:39.975
Sit down.

44:41.776 --> 44:43.852
Oh, stop.

44:44.028 --> 44:48.488
If you don't hold still,
I can't do this. It doesn't hurt.

44:48.657 --> 44:52.240
It hurts. Don't do it that way.

44:52.411 --> 44:57.405
- You're poking me!
- Hold still while I get it out.

44:57.583 --> 45:01.794
- It can't hurt that much.
- How would you know?

45:01.962 --> 45:08.296
- Look at that. That's a big one.
- I've never had one that big in me.

45:11.054 --> 45:16.131
- All better.
- Mikey needs a nap.

45:19.813 --> 45:23.597
Mikey, I've got to go.
See you.

45:23.775 --> 45:31.818
Ready? High-five.
Low-five. Baby-five. Bye.

45:31.991 --> 45:37.780
- Bye.
- My little angel-head.

45:44.128 --> 45:48.754
- Mollie, who was that?
- The babysitter.

45:48.924 --> 45:54.548
The babysitter?
He's not the frozen pop, is he?

45:54.722 --> 45:58.671
- Ma!
- All right, give me the baby.

47:09.461 --> 47:12.996
- Ma . . .
- What?

47:13.173 --> 47:18.250
- You ever get bored with Daddy?
- How can I get bored with Daddy?

47:27.020 --> 47:29.855
Mikey needs a father.

47:30.023 --> 47:35.017
- I just can't find the right guy.
- Mikey will like whoever you like.

47:35.195 --> 47:39.857
- I don't like anybody.
- You know what the secret is?

47:40.033 --> 47:45.786
Find someone you have something
in common with, like Daddy and me.

47:45.955 --> 47:52.290
We both like to go to the movies.
I know someone perfect for you.

47:52.462 --> 48:01.134
He's in Daddy's firm. He's handsome
and smart. You'll love him.

48:02.179 --> 48:06.094
Hello! Rosie didn't tell me
you were beautiful.

48:06.267 --> 48:10.763
I'm surprised, that's usually
the first thing she says.

48:10.938 --> 48:13.144
Come on in.

48:13.315 --> 48:19.567
This is my son Michael. I'll get
dressed. Make yourself comfortable.

48:19.738 --> 48:23.866
- Hi, little guy.
- Who's this yutz?

48:24.034 --> 48:27.652
Are you watching some TV?

48:27.829 --> 48:32.159
Don't touch that.
I don't want to watch football.

48:32.334 --> 48:36.960
Hey, it's the bear show.
Look at that.

48:37.130 --> 48:42.966
- Leave it on football.
- Leave it alone.

48:43.136 --> 48:47.299
- That guy's a good actor.
- Cut it out. It's the play-offs!

48:51.728 --> 48:54.053
You dick.

48:57.984 --> 49:03.109
- Baby! Hot mama!
- You're such a goofball.

49:03.281 --> 49:07.278
- Don't I look good?
- You look slightly cute.

49:07.451 --> 49:11.745
- What are you all dressed up for?
- I've got a hot date.

49:11.914 --> 49:15.698
You'd better call her.
I'm going to be late.

49:15.876 --> 49:20.503
Yeah, right. You've got a date
with an accountant. 9:30 tops.

49:20.673 --> 49:24.456
- Don't count on it.
- Besides, my woman will wait.

49:24.635 --> 49:28.882
Harry, this is the babysitter.
I'll just get my coat.

49:29.056 --> 49:34.892
- I'm just watching the game here.
- Yeah, I've got money on this game.

49:35.062 --> 49:39.640
So you're an accountant?
You and Mollie will get along great.

49:39.816 --> 49:44.395
- She's a CPA.
- I know, her mom told me.

49:44.571 --> 49:48.438
It's got to be tough
being a mom and a CPA.

49:48.616 --> 49:55.330
But Mollie is tough. She hates it
when guys open doors for her -

49:55.498 --> 50:00.160
- or pick up the tab.
It really pisses her off.

50:00.336 --> 50:05.247
- She's liberated?
- Come on. A guy babysitter?

50:05.425 --> 50:10.715
Come here, Mikey.
Say bye-bye to Mama.

50:10.888 --> 50:14.802
- Do this.
- Jeez!

50:14.976 --> 50:19.056
Give it back.
This is really embarrassing.

50:19.230 --> 50:22.729
May I just say one thing?

50:22.900 --> 50:26.435
- You look better without it.
- I think so, too.

50:26.612 --> 50:29.447
- Sexy.
- Yeah.

50:29.615 --> 50:34.490
- All right, I'll leave it off.
- Great.

50:36.038 --> 50:41.459
Bye-bye. See you.
Mikey, high-five.

50:41.627 --> 50:45.292
- Yeah, all right.
- Who was that clown?

50:48.258 --> 50:51.175
It was very uncomfortable.

50:51.344 --> 50:57.133
A kind of bloated, gassy . . .
belchy sensation.

50:57.475 --> 51:02.636
I'd sit down in the bathroom . . .
and nothing would happen.

51:02.814 --> 51:05.731
Nothing would come out.

51:05.900 --> 51:11.274
I called my doctor about two . . .

51:11.447 --> 51:14.733
. . . three weeks after this started.

51:14.909 --> 51:20.781
He said I'd better come in
and have an ultrasound.

51:21.666 --> 51:25.414
- What was I saying?
- Ultrasound.

51:25.586 --> 51:30.331
So I went in for the ultrasound
and they checked it out.

51:30.508 --> 51:35.846
It wasn't gallstones.
They didn't know what it was.

51:36.013 --> 51:41.968
The doctor said I'd better have
an upper G. I. So I went in again.

51:42.144 --> 51:47.055
- Have you ever had a barium enema?
- Not recently.

51:47.232 --> 51:51.230
It's disgusting,
but I did get to see my colon on TV.

51:51.403 --> 51:57.523
Is it true that colons
look 1 0 pounds heavier on TV?

51:57.784 --> 51:59.824
How so?

52:04.999 --> 52:08.285
They never do that for me.

52:18.221 --> 52:22.468
Get on my knee.

52:29.398 --> 52:33.610
- Hold it. Okay.
- Get down, Mikey.

52:37.490 --> 52:41.321
Yeah, I can do that.

52:42.661 --> 52:46.659
Let's walk.

52:50.919 --> 52:53.790
I'm dancing. I'm bad.

52:53.964 --> 52:57.380
- Check me out now.
- Jump.

53:01.763 --> 53:05.049
Hey, can I get paid?

53:17.445 --> 53:20.481
Two, please.

53:25.536 --> 53:28.870
Are you ready?

53:32.710 --> 53:36.542
I'm gonna throw up,
but I like it!

53:36.714 --> 53:39.834
Okay, shake it up.

53:41.510 --> 53:44.428
Right on.

53:47.308 --> 53:50.926
Ready? Shake it, Mikey.

53:52.646 --> 53:56.097
Let's go.

54:00.529 --> 54:02.771
Aeroplane.

54:04.366 --> 54:07.651
Mikey's a plane.
Look at that boy.

54:07.828 --> 54:12.157
All right.

54:15.502 --> 54:18.621
Finally, I passed the stone.

54:18.797 --> 54:22.841
It's the most excruciating thing
you can have, next to giving birth.

54:23.009 --> 54:26.627
- I had a really good time tonight.
- I bet you did.

54:26.804 --> 54:33.934
A lot of guys would feel threatened
by a woman always wanting to pay.

54:34.103 --> 54:37.519
- What?
- Your babysitter told me.

54:37.690 --> 54:40.525
- He did, did he?
- Yeah.

54:40.693 --> 54:45.106
- Come here.
- No, I really have to go up.

54:45.281 --> 54:51.319
- Come on, Mollie, it's early.
- Yeah, but I'm broke.

54:51.495 --> 54:54.117
Jerk.

54:59.670 --> 55:03.502
Shit!

55:17.354 --> 55:21.019
I'm home.

55:21.191 --> 55:26.185
You can go on your date now.

55:54.265 --> 55:57.847
- Hey, Mikey!
- Sarah, how are you doing?

55:58.018 --> 56:01.138
- I want to talk to you.
- Sorry, got to go.

56:03.691 --> 56:06.894
Right back at you, babe.

56:07.069 --> 56:13.522
- Hiya, Mickey.
- Look at that hat.

56:15.077 --> 56:20.035
- Megan, good to see you.
- Mikey, where've you been?

56:20.207 --> 56:24.536
- Did you get your hair cut?
- Yeah, what do you think?

56:24.711 --> 56:28.578
I hate it.
My mother did it herself.

56:28.757 --> 56:32.457
It looks great.

56:32.635 --> 56:35.755
I used to have curls at the end.

56:35.930 --> 56:39.880
- I remember.
- I was the one with the cute curls.

56:40.059 --> 56:44.638
- Now they're gone.
- You're still cute.

56:44.814 --> 56:49.725
- I look like a boy. No offence.
- Nice talking to you.

56:54.615 --> 57:01.116
How many babies does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

57:01.288 --> 57:07.124
- How many?
- What's a light bulb?

57:08.921 --> 57:12.290
I don't get it.

57:12.466 --> 57:16.843
Where's she going?
Who's that big guy?

57:17.012 --> 57:23.097
- Who is he?
- That's okay. That's her daddy.

57:23.268 --> 57:26.222
What's a daddy? What do they do?

57:26.396 --> 57:31.473
The big men types
who hang around with the mommies.

57:31.651 --> 57:35.316
I get it. Maybe I'll ask James
to be my daddy.

57:44.164 --> 57:48.956
We 'll eat all the pudding now . . .

57:51.796 --> 57:56.339
- I still ain't eating it.
- Yummy.

58:00.429 --> 58:04.297
All right, don't look at Mommy.

58:18.697 --> 58:21.615
You've got to love her.

58:39.926 --> 58:43.544
Watch this, Mikey.

58:52.605 --> 58:57.600
- Now that's entertainment.
- Not in front of Mikey.

58:57.777 --> 59:02.854
- Look at the look on his face.
- He looks like his father.

59:03.032 --> 59:06.483
You said
you were artificially inseminated.

59:06.661 --> 59:11.702
I was, but I never make that face.
I assume his father does.

59:11.874 --> 59:16.002
You know what I thought
you'd enjoy doing today?

59:16.170 --> 59:21.211
- Go to my grandfather's new home.
- You thought I'd enjoy that?

59:21.383 --> 59:26.294
Yeah, you'd enjoy it . . .
Maybe you'd sign a few papers.

59:26.472 --> 59:31.180
You are such a baby. If you want me
to do something, just ask.

59:31.351 --> 59:37.224
Would you please come with me
to sign these papers?

59:37.399 --> 59:41.479
- That's how you handle a woman.
- Really?

59:46.533 --> 59:50.696
You want to go to lunch
at North Eastern Life lnsurance?

59:50.870 --> 59:55.117
- Employees get free lunches.
- We'll get caught.

59:55.291 --> 59:59.336
I must know 20 ways
to get a free lunch in this town.

59:59.504 --> 01:00:02.624
- You do this a lot?
- Sure.

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:09.252
I don't pay for L. D.'s, either.
Long distance phone calls.

01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:12.515
I go up to a company receptionist.

01:00:12.683 --> 01:00:19.765
I pretend I'm a lost messenger,
and they let me use their phone.

01:00:20.608 --> 01:00:25.400
I wouldn't be driving this cab
if I made more instructing.

01:00:25.571 --> 01:00:31.111
- What do flight instructors make?
- If I hustle, about 1 , 1 00 . . .

01:00:31.285 --> 01:00:37.204
. . . a month.
But I get to accumulate air time.

01:00:40.127 --> 01:00:45.369
- Give me my bag!
- He's not stealing our bags.

01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:49.593
- I've got my teeth in there.
- They're coming with us.

01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:53.510
Tell him not to touch my teeth.

01:00:57.310 --> 01:01:01.260
Welcome, gramps.

01:01:01.439 --> 01:01:06.778
- Are we stopping for a bite to eat?
- No, this is your new place.

01:01:06.945 --> 01:01:10.894
- They got good shrimp here?
- And lobster.

01:01:11.074 --> 01:01:14.774
This is it. Enjoy your stay.

01:01:14.952 --> 01:01:18.119
Grandpa, this is great.

01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:23.628
You've got a terrific view.
No roommate to bug you. Television.

01:01:23.794 --> 01:01:26.712
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:01:26.881 --> 01:01:32.385
He's got a sweet tooth.
Give him one candy bar a day.

01:01:32.553 --> 01:01:39.006
- Just don't let him find the bag.
- No problem.

01:01:39.184 --> 01:01:41.343
That smells good.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:47.854
- Grandpa, that smells good.
- I'd like to see you eat it.

01:01:48.026 --> 01:01:50.696
Watch this.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.858
Let me try that.

01:01:59.037 --> 01:02:03.201
- What do you want?
- Mollie helped us get this place.

01:02:03.375 --> 01:02:09.876
The woman has thousands more nerves
in the sexual organs than the man.

01:02:10.048 --> 01:02:15.173
- I bet the kid's not even yours.
- That's it! Be nice.

01:02:17.347 --> 01:02:22.507
He's worse at this than I am.
Let me give you a hand.

01:02:22.685 --> 01:02:25.888
Come on, taste it.

01:02:26.063 --> 01:02:28.021
Open wide.

01:02:30.693 --> 01:02:35.022
- Thank you for helping me.
- You're welcome.

01:02:35.197 --> 01:02:39.147
- You want to go flying?
- That would be way too expensive.

01:02:39.326 --> 01:02:45.080
- Maintenance flights are free.
- You get everything for free.

01:02:45.249 --> 01:02:49.911
Free phone calls, free lunches . . .
You're a scam artist.

01:02:50.087 --> 01:02:56.457
I've got the town wired. If we were
poor, we'd still live like kings.

01:02:56.635 --> 01:03:00.467
- Fly with me.
- I'm not that kind of person.

01:03:00.639 --> 01:03:05.431
- Come on. Are you scared?
- No, I'm not scared!

01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:11.306
- Where are the parachutes?
- There are no parachutes.

01:03:11.483 --> 01:03:17.069
Didn't you ever see
"The Buddy Holly Story", "La Bamba"?

01:03:17.238 --> 01:03:21.984
There's one big difference.
They were rock legends. You're not.

01:03:24.287 --> 01:03:28.332
- Is your wing smoking?
- No . . . Oh, my God!

01:03:28.499 --> 01:03:33.457
- It was just a joke to relax you.
- I'm just so nervous.

01:03:33.629 --> 01:03:36.547
I feel so out of control.

01:03:36.716 --> 01:03:42.801
I'll give you your first lesson.
Put your hand on my stick.

01:03:42.972 --> 01:03:47.799
- I'm not touching your stick.
- This is not a sexual thing.

01:03:47.977 --> 01:03:50.681
That feels good, baby.

01:03:50.855 --> 01:03:54.852
Get familiar with the stick.

01:03:55.025 --> 01:04:00.150
- There you go, you're flying.
- I'm flying!

01:04:00.322 --> 01:04:06.407
I'm doing a good job. This is easy!
What a good sensation!

01:04:06.578 --> 01:04:12.414
- It's like great sex, isn't it?
- I personally wouldn't remember.

01:04:12.751 --> 01:04:17.460
- He's pretty tired.
- He's had a busy day.

01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:26.924
- Do you want a drink?
- Do you want to watch a movie?

01:05:22.777 --> 01:05:24.936
Stop it!

01:05:25.155 --> 01:05:30.529
Stop yelling or your father will
give you something to yell about.

01:05:30.702 --> 01:05:34.450
Knock it off!

01:05:34.622 --> 01:05:39.699
Princess,
you're making my mouth water.

01:05:39.878 --> 01:05:42.084
I'm hungry.

01:05:42.255 --> 01:05:48.375
Hold your horses, or I'll knock you
from here to kingdom come.

01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:52.965
You know that dumpster behind
the supermarket? Look what I found.

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:58.811
A perfectly good head of lettuce,
just peel off the outer layers.

01:05:58.979 --> 01:06:05.183
Who wants a surprise?
Could be lunch meat or peaches.

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:11.233
The point is this: Just because
it's free, don't mean it's no good.

01:06:11.408 --> 01:06:16.913
- Do we live like kings, or what?
- We sure do.

01:06:26.339 --> 01:06:28.961
Again!

01:06:29.134 --> 01:06:32.218
Wait a minute.

01:06:32.387 --> 01:06:36.550
- I'm sorry, I really do want this.
- I do, too.

01:06:36.725 --> 01:06:39.298
- It's Mikey.
- He's asleep.

01:06:39.477 --> 01:06:46.358
I have to be very clear
on the choices I make for him.

01:06:46.526 --> 01:06:53.524
I can't make any more mistakes
that are going to hurt Mikey.

01:06:53.699 --> 01:06:59.453
- But I'm crazy about Mikey.
- I know that I was leading you on.

01:06:59.622 --> 01:07:03.869
You're such a good kisser and
I haven't had sex in a long time . . .

01:07:04.669 --> 01:07:09.496
Goodbye. Please . . . Goodbye.

01:07:09.673 --> 01:07:15.676
- Mollie, could I talk to you?
- Hold just a minute, please.

01:07:15.846 --> 01:07:21.137
Just between you and me,
what's with you and Chubby Charles?

01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:24.014
What do you mean?

01:07:24.188 --> 01:07:28.896
Pearlman's doing the bank recs.
Rubenstein's doing the quarterlies.

01:07:29.067 --> 01:07:33.694
Now Albert's returns are due.
So what's with you?

01:07:33.864 --> 01:07:40.151
I traded Rubenstein two accounts
for the Chubby Charles account.

01:07:40.328 --> 01:07:43.531
I can't do it anymore . . .
It's personal.

01:07:43.707 --> 01:07:48.250
We're accountants . . .
we're not personal.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:52.287
- I don't . . .
- You've worked for him for years.

01:07:52.465 --> 01:07:55.799
Now, with all the new tax laws,
you desert him.

01:07:55.969 --> 01:08:00.298
- You don't understand . . .
- I want you up there tomorrow.

01:08:01.933 --> 01:08:06.760
Don't give me that look.
And you, get back to work.

01:08:10.358 --> 01:08:16.063
Please, give me a second chance.
This has been like a bad dream.

01:08:16.238 --> 01:08:19.607
I felt so guilty
leaving Beth and the girls.

01:08:19.783 --> 01:08:26.497
You've been such an asshole,
I'd have to torture you.

01:08:26.665 --> 01:08:30.283
That's okay. I want you to.

01:08:30.461 --> 01:08:33.995
- Mollie, Mollie . . .
- What?

01:08:34.171 --> 01:08:38.300
- I'll burst if I don't kiss you.
- Tough!

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:46.679
Albert can see you now.

01:08:52.148 --> 01:08:56.193
- Mollie, how's Mickey?
- Mikey.

01:08:56.361 --> 01:08:59.397
- Is he talking yet?
- No.

01:08:59.572 --> 01:09:03.486
Crawling?
I remember Astrid crawling . . .

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:07.359
I'm not interested in your stories.

01:09:07.537 --> 01:09:14.252
- I've been meaning to talk to you.
- I'm here to do your taxes.

01:09:16.421 --> 01:09:20.372
Eyelash tinting,
body wraps, facials . . .

01:09:20.551 --> 01:09:25.509
- You can't deduct any of this crap.
- And the exercise instructor?

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:33.095
Not unless she suffered any injury.
What's the little woman been up to?

01:09:33.272 --> 01:09:37.768
Is Priscilla sick?
These doctor bills are for her.

01:09:37.943 --> 01:09:41.193
Therapy.
Beth communicaes with the dead.

01:09:41.363 --> 01:09:44.613
It really frightens Priscilla.

01:09:44.783 --> 01:09:50.738
We're all seeing a psychiatrist now.
I've been learning a lot.

01:09:50.913 --> 01:09:55.742
- I'm happy for you, Albert.
- I know you've been through a lot.

01:09:55.919 --> 01:10:01.791
You've got to believe I love you.
I never meant for this to go bad.

01:10:01.966 --> 01:10:07.209
- It just turned out that way.
- It took $20,000 to find that out?

01:10:07.388 --> 01:10:12.596
- Do you have a picture of Mickey?
- Mikey!

01:10:12.769 --> 01:10:16.766
- I think about you two every day.
- You'd never know it.

01:10:16.939 --> 01:10:20.557
I try to call, but I can't do it.

01:10:20.735 --> 01:10:25.443
I'm too ashamed.
I'm afraid of what you'll say.

01:10:25.614 --> 01:10:29.233
I've been so confused.

01:10:40.587 --> 01:10:44.087
- He has my eyes.
- I know.

01:10:44.258 --> 01:10:48.884
It's confusing loving someone
who looks like someone you hate.

01:10:49.054 --> 01:10:51.379
Could I see him?

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:59.145
All right.
I'll be home this evening.

01:10:59.314 --> 01:11:04.439
Next time you talk to your mom,
put in a good word in for me.

01:11:04.611 --> 01:11:07.446
Hit me. Hit it again.

01:11:07.614 --> 01:11:10.899
- No . . . yeah?
- Hit it again.

01:11:11.075 --> 01:11:16.615
- I know what I'm doing.
- Damn! You won again.

01:11:16.789 --> 01:11:22.744
I told you I could play. I've been
thinking about this daddy business.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.455
I want you to be my daddy.
I'll tell Mommy.

01:11:28.843 --> 01:11:32.093
- Who is it?
- Mollie?

01:11:35.683 --> 01:11:39.894
- Is Mollie here?
- No, she's at aerobics class.

01:11:41.272 --> 01:11:45.933
- Is Mikey here? I'm his father.
- His father?

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:50.522
- Are you the sperm donor?
- I'm the kid's father?

01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:56.783
- He's from artificial insemination.
- I've known Mollie for years.

01:11:56.954 --> 01:12:00.536
- I have a key.
- We're changing it.

01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:05.539
- What?
- That's my kid in there. Let me by.

01:12:05.712 --> 01:12:09.579
If you are the father,
answer me a few questions.

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:14.633
- When was he born?
- July third.

01:12:14.804 --> 01:12:18.469
What's his favourite toy,
Fred or Barney? Fred?

01:12:18.641 --> 01:12:23.802
No, Barney. How many diapers
does he go through a day? Six.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:28.558
- A father should know.
- How much is she paying you?

01:12:28.735 --> 01:12:32.684
- Go play some video games.
- Don't give me that shit.

01:12:34.657 --> 01:12:38.951
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.200
Go for the body!

01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:52.037
Get out of here!

01:12:54.802 --> 01:12:58.882
Yes, that feels good.

01:13:04.394 --> 01:13:09.140
- What happened?
- Who's Albert?

01:13:09.316 --> 01:13:13.894
- Why, was he here?
- Is he Mikey's father?

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:21.070
- You lied about the insemination.
- He was married.

01:13:21.244 --> 01:13:26.120
Do you love him?

01:13:26.291 --> 01:13:29.742
- What?
- Do you love him?

01:13:29.919 --> 01:13:32.920
I don't know who I love.

01:13:33.089 --> 01:13:37.751
The only thing that matters to me
is who's best for Mikey.

01:13:37.927 --> 01:13:45.175
Albert is successful, responsible
and he's good to his other kids.

01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:50.974
- I don't want him seeing Mikey.
- Don't start pulling this on me.

01:13:51.148 --> 01:13:56.143
- He has a right to see his son.
- Where has he been all year?

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:01.990
- You are not his father.
- I'm the closest thing he's got.

01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:05.694
Look at you. You're like a big kid.

01:14:05.871 --> 01:14:10.782
Are you responsible enough
to be a father?

01:14:10.959 --> 01:14:14.577
Is getting pregnant by a married man
responsible?

01:14:14.755 --> 01:14:17.542
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

01:14:17.716 --> 01:14:23.754
I've seen you use Mikey to push guys
away, and now you're doing it to me.

01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:28.177
- Get out!
- I live here!

01:14:35.358 --> 01:14:40.020
Can a person past
a certain age change?

01:14:40.196 --> 01:14:42.865
Daddy's lipids fell to 1 85.

01:14:43.032 --> 01:14:48.275
I'm not talking about cholesterol.
Can someone become nicer?

01:14:48.454 --> 01:14:50.660
I don't know.

01:14:50.831 --> 01:14:55.292
When you met Daddy at that dance,
did you know he'd be a good father?

01:14:55.461 --> 01:15:01.748
- I liked the look of his uniform.
- They all wore uniforms.

01:15:01.926 --> 01:15:05.129
I didn't like
the sailors' bell-bottoms.

01:15:05.304 --> 01:15:11.674
You had no idea if he was
a mature responsible person.

01:15:11.852 --> 01:15:17.475
If I thought like that, we wouldn't
have had so much fun the first week.

01:15:17.649 --> 01:15:23.106
You're grossing me out.
Don't talk about sex and Daddy.

01:15:24.364 --> 01:15:27.815
Hi, Lupe.

01:15:27.993 --> 01:15:32.453
I just want to talk to Mikey
for a minute.

01:15:33.957 --> 01:15:37.907
Hey, Gerber-face, high-five.

01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:46.384
Look, Mikey . . . I don't know
if I can keep coming to see you.

01:15:46.552 --> 01:15:49.886
- What's the matter?
- It's your mom.

01:15:50.056 --> 01:15:54.801
She's got this crazy idea
that I wouldn't make a good father.

01:15:54.977 --> 01:15:59.686
She probably wouldn't
have picked my father, either.

01:15:59.857 --> 01:16:06.275
I think he did an okay job.
Want to hear some fatherly advice?

01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:11.570
Hi, Lupe.

01:16:11.744 --> 01:16:18.742
- The man's in the baby's room.
- Okay, I'll write you a check.

01:16:18.917 --> 01:16:25.086
He said, "Don't hit girls,
even if they're asking for it."

01:16:25.257 --> 01:16:27.463
What about pushing them?

01:16:27.634 --> 01:16:35.428
He'd say, "Finish your meat,
you know how much that cost? "

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:41.306
The one that sticks out the most
was probably . . .

01:16:41.481 --> 01:16:46.439
"lf your friend jumps off a bridge,
does that mean you've got to?"

01:16:46.611 --> 01:16:53.325
To this very day,
I still use that piece of advice.

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:57.780
It doesn't amount to much.

01:16:57.955 --> 01:17:05.702
A good father keeps the mother happy
so she doesn't drive the kids crazy.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.008
She called me a big kid . . .
She's probably right.

01:17:10.176 --> 01:17:14.339
You're one year old
and my best friend in the world.

01:17:14.513 --> 01:17:18.262
Anyway . . .

01:17:20.728 --> 01:17:25.306
- I'll miss you.
- Don't be sad. Here, take this.

01:17:30.654 --> 01:17:37.191
- No, I want you to have it.
- Okay, thanks.

01:17:37.369 --> 01:17:40.904
He'll take good care of you.

01:17:46.169 --> 01:17:50.712
- We're going to see Daddy today.
- I was just thinking about James.

01:17:50.882 --> 01:17:57.003
- The blue or the lamb?
- They both look pretty lame.

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.964
- The lamb?
- Not lamb, lame!

01:18:01.142 --> 01:18:05.638
Please don't make me wear clothes
with animals on them.

01:18:05.813 --> 01:18:10.309
I don't like this.
It makes me look stupid.

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:15.989
- You look great.
- I feel like a retard.

01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:23.527
Look at this room.
Look at these guys.

01:18:23.706 --> 01:18:27.039
I bet I could take those apart.

01:18:27.209 --> 01:18:32.713
Little metal things . . . I'll stick
them in those little holes.

01:18:33.632 --> 01:18:39.006
Mollie, hi. This must be Mikey.

01:18:39.179 --> 01:18:44.339
Hiya, fella. What are you doing?

01:18:44.518 --> 01:18:48.765
- Aren't you a handsome . . .
- Milk in the eye.

01:18:48.939 --> 01:18:51.227
Bull's-eye!

01:18:51.399 --> 01:18:56.524
It's all right.
It's just milk, it won't stain.

01:18:58.031 --> 01:19:04.318
- He's beautiful. He looks like you.
- A lot of people say that.

01:19:04.496 --> 01:19:09.952
I know the circumstances
you had him under were terrible.

01:19:10.126 --> 01:19:15.120
- But I know it wasn't a mistake.
- I bet he's glad to hear that.

01:19:15.298 --> 01:19:19.509
You will never escape me.

01:19:19.677 --> 01:19:23.627
- Mikey, don't do that!
- What did I do?

01:19:23.806 --> 01:19:31.470
Some people don't have the strength
to get out certain situations.

01:19:31.647 --> 01:19:35.727
What are you trying to say?
Mikey, don't touch that.

01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:42.105
I'm saying I still love you
and I still want you.

01:19:42.282 --> 01:19:48.486
- And what about Mikey?
- Count on me. Whatever he needs.

01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:52.072
He needs a father.

01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:58.502
I'm living alone for the first time
in 1 7 years. I'm in therapy.

01:19:58.673 --> 01:20:04.130
I can't be anybody's father now.
I need to be by myself.

01:20:04.304 --> 01:20:09.725
- I've raised my kids.
- Raised them? They're 1 1 and 9!

01:20:09.893 --> 01:20:14.851
- Have they moved out?
- Too much fruit!

01:20:15.023 --> 01:20:19.483
It wouldn't be fair to Mikey.

01:20:19.652 --> 01:20:24.113
- Is he taking a dump?
- No, he's thinking real hard.

01:20:27.285 --> 01:20:32.955
- I'll get you cleaned up.
- Use the washroom in the back.

01:20:33.124 --> 01:20:39.043
- He'll ask about his daddy.
- I want James to be the daddy.

01:20:39.213 --> 01:20:44.420
Don't do that here.
That's a $1 0,000 desk!

01:20:44.593 --> 01:20:49.421
- Now it's junk!
- I thought you'd understand.

01:20:49.598 --> 01:20:56.596
Of course I understand. You're going
through a selfish phase.

01:20:56.772 --> 01:21:01.813
I know you will understand that I'm
going through a destructive phase.

01:21:06.907 --> 01:21:09.824
Let's trash the place.

01:21:16.958 --> 01:21:20.541
I'm sorry about that stupid outfit.

01:21:20.712 --> 01:21:25.872
I'm sorry I made you meet
that mean man. Never again.

01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:32.053
Every time I take you someplace,
people are crazy about you.

01:21:32.223 --> 01:21:38.059
Yet the person who has a genetic
bond to you treats you like a jerk.

01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:42.226
Everybody loves you.
All the kids at the playground.

01:21:42.399 --> 01:21:45.436
Ma loves you. Rona loves you.

01:21:45.611 --> 01:21:50.985
James loves you.
Mikey, do you love James?

01:21:53.577 --> 01:21:59.081
- Give him a call.
- Do you want to play telephone?

01:21:59.249 --> 01:22:02.120
Hello?

01:22:02.294 --> 01:22:07.454
It's for you. You take this one,
I'll take the other one.

01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:12.923
This is Lou Franklin,
I'm phoning about your grandfather.

01:22:13.096 --> 01:22:16.963
He's become abusive and violent.

01:22:17.142 --> 01:22:22.765
- Should I call Health & Welfare?
- No, I'll come and pick him up.

01:22:33.366 --> 01:22:37.031
- What's going on?
- I'm a hostage.

01:22:37.203 --> 01:22:40.204
He's a mean old bastard!

01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:44.620
- Look what he did to my arm?
- Don't talk to him like that.

01:22:44.794 --> 01:22:48.626
- They're hiding Dora.
- They are not.

01:22:48.798 --> 01:22:54.800
- Then where is she?
- Sit down. I'll find her for you.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:23:00.890
Let's get your face cleaned up.
You want to look good for her.

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:07.730
You're my favourite daughter-in-law.
You're smart and a good person.

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:12.775
That's why Jimmy loves you so much.

01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:20.074
- There you go.
- Let's go find James.

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:24.408
I'll show you some pictures.

01:23:25.458 --> 01:23:30.334
Grandpa, did you eat all these
candy bars today?

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:35.001
- The bastards stole my candy.
- We'll get some more.

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:38.877
- Where's the director's office?
- Down the hall.

01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:43.349
- We're busy.
- I'll keep my eye on them for you.

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:47.100
I'll be back in a minute.

01:23:47.271 --> 01:23:54.401
This isn't his usual behaviour.
My husband made arrangements.

01:23:54.570 --> 01:23:59.196
It isn't the orderly's
responsibility to control his diet.

01:23:59.366 --> 01:24:02.652
He requires a private nurse.

01:24:02.828 --> 01:24:12.330
No, he doesn't. The orderly was told
to give him one candy bar a day.

01:24:12.504 --> 01:24:16.454
- He said no problem.
- That was Bill.

01:24:16.633 --> 01:24:22.256
Bill always says no problem.
The man can't speak English.

01:24:24.182 --> 01:24:27.966
- So can Grandpa stay?
- Of course.

01:24:28.144 --> 01:24:34.728
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming down so fast.

01:24:37.028 --> 01:24:41.192
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:41.366 --> 01:24:47.238
- Your grandfather can stay.
- You didn't have to do that.

01:24:47.413 --> 01:24:52.573
- I wanted to do it.
- Let me give you a ride home.

01:24:52.752 --> 01:24:55.159
- Don't bother.
- Fine!

01:24:55.338 --> 01:24:59.916
D.J. , it's time for lunch.
Let's go.

01:25:00.092 --> 01:25:04.386
- Are you okay with him?
- Get the hell out of here.

01:25:06.474 --> 01:25:10.851
Steven and Paulie,
they're your cousins.

01:25:12.271 --> 01:25:16.897
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello, Esther.

01:25:21.572 --> 01:25:26.814
Esther . . . I'd like you
to meet my grandson.

01:25:27.953 --> 01:25:31.452
Hey, there goes James.

01:25:31.623 --> 01:25:36.415
Where's he going?
Maybe he's going downstairs.

01:25:36.586 --> 01:25:41.960
- They took me to the beauty salon.
- Where's the elevator.

01:25:42.133 --> 01:25:45.336
Going down.

01:25:45.512 --> 01:25:49.177
I'll just press all these.

01:25:50.558 --> 01:25:55.303
Perfect! I'll just hitch a ride
with the fruit cups.

01:25:58.107 --> 01:26:01.975
There we go. Take her away, boys.

01:26:03.779 --> 01:26:08.026
- Mikey.
- Grandpa, where's Mikey?

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:14.570
- He was just here.
- How long ago did he leave?

01:26:14.748 --> 01:26:18.828
- I'll check the hallway.
- I'm calling the police.

01:26:20.254 --> 01:26:23.338
Hi, toots. Anyone seen my dad?

01:26:23.507 --> 01:26:29.711
- That's lda's grandson.
- Come on, I'm in a hurry.

01:26:29.888 --> 01:26:35.642
- Here, fella, go find your grandma.
- Thanks for nothing.

01:26:35.811 --> 01:26:41.397
When the police get here,
will you show them these pictures?

01:26:41.566 --> 01:26:44.816
All right, I'm on the case now.

01:26:47.155 --> 01:26:51.022
That is exactly what I need.

01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:56.491
I could find him in one of those.
Let's see if I remember this.

01:26:56.664 --> 01:27:01.622
I'll set this thing down right here
and get that door open.

01:27:01.794 --> 01:27:05.128
What was it James said?

01:27:05.298 --> 01:27:09.509
Stick this in here . . .
There it goes.

01:27:09.677 --> 01:27:13.342
Move the circle around
and we're off.

01:27:13.556 --> 01:27:15.844
Mikey!

01:27:16.017 --> 01:27:18.768
Mikey!

01:27:22.565 --> 01:27:27.357
- He's in the back of that car.
- Let's get the cab.

01:27:27.528 --> 01:27:31.228
- Hey!
- Stop!

01:27:39.998 --> 01:27:43.201
I got this driving thing knocked.

01:27:48.632 --> 01:27:51.586
Move it!

01:27:52.969 --> 01:27:58.046
There he is. Look at me.
Hey, James, I'm driving!

01:27:59.392 --> 01:28:05.929
James . . . where's he going?

01:28:09.777 --> 01:28:12.897
- What are you doing?
- I'll cut him off.

01:28:13.072 --> 01:28:15.480
You'll lose him.

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.658
I know this alley
like the back of my hand.

01:28:37.054 --> 01:28:42.131
Mikey! He's gone!

01:28:42.309 --> 01:28:44.551
Mikey!

01:28:44.728 --> 01:28:50.149
- You had a little boy in there.
- What are you talking about?

01:28:50.317 --> 01:28:53.104
He's about this big.

01:28:53.278 --> 01:28:58.070
- This is a good place to spot him.
- Mikey!

01:28:58.241 --> 01:29:01.527
Mikey, stop!

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:05.072
- James, is that you?
- Mikey, don't move.

01:29:05.248 --> 01:29:08.747
James, Mommy . . .

01:29:08.918 --> 01:29:11.290
Here I come.

01:29:11.462 --> 01:29:14.962
- Mikey!
- I'm coming.

01:29:25.601 --> 01:29:31.271
- Did you see what just happened?
- Give me my baby.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:39.271
Are you all right, honey?
Let me see you.

01:29:39.448 --> 01:29:42.651
He doesn't have a scratch on him.

01:29:42.826 --> 01:29:45.697
I finally got you both together.

01:29:45.871 --> 01:29:49.703
I better take
him to the hospital anyway.

01:29:49.875 --> 01:29:54.038
Ma, I want James to be the daddy.

01:29:54.212 --> 01:29:58.709
- Thanks for all your help.
- I'll take you home now.

01:30:00.302 --> 01:30:06.636
- Dada.
- I think he called you Dada.

01:30:06.808 --> 01:30:09.429
No, I'm talking
to hear myself speak.

01:30:09.602 --> 01:30:14.099
- He thinks you're his father.
- I've spent a lot of time with him.

01:30:14.274 --> 01:30:18.686
He probably thinks
we're going to end up together.

01:30:27.787 --> 01:30:31.571
I hope
they don't get stuck together.

01:30:35.878 --> 01:30:40.587
Should I tell them
I need a new diaper?

01:30:40.758 --> 01:30:42.797
No, I'll wait.

01:31:36.813 --> 01:31:41.225
- Hi, honey.
- Mikey, this is your sister Julie.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.974
Say "Hi, Julie."

01:31:44.153 --> 01:31:49.527
Don't start with me, kid! I've had
a day you wouldn't believe.
