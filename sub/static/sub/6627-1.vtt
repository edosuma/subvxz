01:43.145 --> 01:45.772
- First time to France?
- Yes.

01:50.321 --> 01:52.656
Purpose of your visit?

01:52.781 --> 01:55.160
- Business or pleasure?
- Pleasure.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.832
Do you like this music? No?

02:36.874 --> 02:40.670
Yeah, yeah.

04:05.937 --> 04:07.813
You can put your things over there.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.679
How long are you
planning on staying?

04:36.305 --> 04:38.349
Not very long.

05:12.889 --> 05:14.891
Message for Mr. Smith.

05:14.891 --> 05:17.895
- Smith?
- Yes.

05:21.774 --> 05:24.485
Smith.

05:24.611 --> 05:27.489
Ah.

05:38.168 --> 05:40.086
He's here.

06:09.579 --> 06:11.999
Monsieur, good evening.
Anything to drink?

06:12.124 --> 06:14.001
- Water.
- Sparkling or flat?

06:15.712 --> 06:17.589
Flat.

06:27.309 --> 06:29.811
- Last one for the road.
- A beer?

06:29.852 --> 06:31.897
Oh, yes.

06:32.022 --> 06:33.983
So, how are you, pal?

06:35.526 --> 06:38.280
Just a little
pre-takeoff takeoff.

06:38.321 --> 06:41.826
Gives new meaning to
"flying the friendly skies."

06:41.867 --> 06:45.746
- Can I buy you a drink? A serious drink?
- No, thank you.

06:45.830 --> 06:48.751
- Where are you from? Ah, China.
- Beijing.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.920
My favorite.
I love China.

06:51.004 --> 06:53.172
I love the food-- Chinese food.
It's the best.

06:53.172 --> 06:55.884
Yeah, the way they cut things
in little pieces...

06:55.925 --> 06:59.888
so that you don't have to
use all that heavy silverware.

06:59.971 --> 07:03.225
Brilliant invention, the chopstick.
Not like us barbarians.

07:03.350 --> 07:06.313
I mean, there we are,
sticking our forks into the food...

07:06.354 --> 07:09.983
and hacking it up
with our knives.

07:10.025 --> 07:12.069
- First time in Paris?
- Yes.

07:12.194 --> 07:15.616
Mmm. Great.

07:19.245 --> 07:21.205
Men's toilet, now.

07:23.874 --> 07:26.168
You're gonna have
the time of your life.

08:08.719 --> 08:10.846
Hands up, please.

09:05.201 --> 09:07.203
My boss is dying to meet you.

09:23.805 --> 09:26.935
Ahh.

09:47.415 --> 09:51.004
Gun, please.

09:51.004 --> 09:53.966
You won't need it.
You're safe with us.

09:57.721 --> 10:02.685
So, you came all the way from China
to keep an eye on us.

10:02.726 --> 10:06.146
- To help you.
- Yes, of course.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.275
To help us,
since we are so incompetent.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.568
'Cause after all,
what is our miserable history...

10:11.652 --> 10:13.989
compared to yours?

10:17.451 --> 10:20.414
Since we have to work together,
I don't want to spend half the day
killing your name.

10:20.455 --> 10:23.041
- You got a nickname?
- No.

10:23.166 --> 10:26.170
Why don't we give you one.
How about John?

10:26.170 --> 10:28.173
I like that.

10:29.758 --> 10:31.677
Richard.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.470
Inspector Richard.

10:36.765 --> 10:40.019
Welcome to Paris, Johnny.

10:57.081 --> 11:00.501
So, what's on the menu tonight?

11:01.919 --> 11:05.089
They're talking about
the stock market.

11:12.265 --> 11:14.893
What fuckin' time do you call this?
Don't ever keep me waiting.

11:14.935 --> 11:18.106
You got me?
Come on. Let's go.

11:29.117 --> 11:31.119
Ah, there you are.

11:31.119 --> 11:33.247
Smile, girls. Smile.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.836
Welcome to gay Paris.

11:37.836 --> 11:40.966
This is a few friends of mine.
This is Veronica, Susan.

11:41.132 --> 11:43.218
Say hello.

11:46.013 --> 11:48.267
Yeah, sit, sit.

11:51.019 --> 11:54.230
Hey, cool it.
Hey, fuckin' cool it, all right?

11:54.272 --> 11:56.441
I think we have a situation.

11:56.525 --> 11:58.402
One man, two girls.

11:58.443 --> 12:00.445
- You see them?
- Yes, I do.

12:06.537 --> 12:08.539
Want to go to Heaven?

12:08.539 --> 12:09.456
Want to go to Heaven?

12:16.465 --> 12:18.969
Let's go.

12:21.179 --> 12:23.180
- I'm going up.
- But, boss, the meeting.

12:23.306 --> 12:28.437
I flew 12,000 miles for a cocksucker
of a contact. He can wait for me!

12:28.478 --> 12:30.732
I don't know if I can do this.

12:30.773 --> 12:34.193
Don't worry.
Let Mama run the show.

12:34.319 --> 12:36.572
- Hmm?
- Okay, let's go to Heaven.

12:38.407 --> 12:42.663
He's leaving with the two hookers.
What should I do?

12:42.747 --> 12:46.375
Come up... and enjoy the show.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.336
Wow!

12:59.098 --> 13:02.810
- Boss, we didn't check the room.
- One minute.

13:06.523 --> 13:09.527
Let's party, big boy.

13:14.116 --> 13:17.702
Come on, baby. Let's have some fun.

13:18.995 --> 13:22.249
- I don't feel so good.
- Want a fix?

13:22.249 --> 13:25.629
- No! I told you, I quit.
- More for me.

13:55.580 --> 13:57.541
Your meeting's up, guys!
Everybody, out!

13:57.582 --> 14:00.002
But, boss, we didn't
finish searching.

14:00.043 --> 14:03.173
- Get out!
- Okay, guys, let's get out of here.

14:40.048 --> 14:42.926
I have to go to the bathroom, okay?

14:42.968 --> 14:46.765
- Okay. Come back soon.
- Sure.

14:52.063 --> 14:55.525
Oh, hey, Johnny.
Just in time.

14:55.525 --> 14:58.071
- This wasn't part of the plan.
- It is now. Don't worry.

14:58.112 --> 15:01.991
It's all under control.
He'll do his thing, then we'll do ours.

15:02.075 --> 15:05.536
- Where's the other girl?
- Prettying up in the bathroom.

15:27.729 --> 15:30.441
- You want to go to Heaven?
- Take me to Heaven!

15:33.443 --> 15:36.030
I'm going! Yes! Yes!

15:36.114 --> 15:39.575
I'm going!

15:42.579 --> 15:45.417
No!

16:03.770 --> 16:05.772
You motherfucker!
Let me up!

16:13.198 --> 16:16.202
She stabbed me!
The dumb bitch stabbed me!

16:16.286 --> 16:19.081
Stay calm.

16:19.206 --> 16:21.375
Stay calm. Stay calm.

16:25.796 --> 16:28.632
I'm dying.

16:35.308 --> 16:37.935
Stop recording.

16:38.019 --> 16:40.522
- Fuck!
- We need to get him to the hospital.

16:40.648 --> 16:43.359
He doesn't wanna go to a hospital.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.987
He wants to go to Heaven.

16:52.244 --> 16:55.331
- Why did you kill him?
- The question is, why did you kill him?

16:55.373 --> 16:58.125
Richard, look what he did to me!
Help me!

17:00.252 --> 17:03.091
Thanks for the help, Johnny.

17:21.569 --> 17:23.863
I was just in here.

17:23.863 --> 17:27.117
I felt a little sick, and then there was
all this screaming and shooting and--

17:27.159 --> 17:29.579
Shut up!

17:29.705 --> 17:31.289
There!

17:42.177 --> 17:44.264
He's on the fifth floor.
Everyone, down.

18:19.053 --> 18:20.929
He's on the eighth floor.
Everybody, back up!

18:52.133 --> 18:55.429
want him dead!

19:27.592 --> 19:29.594
He's in the laundry room!
Everyone, down!

19:29.594 --> 19:32.472
- He's down in the laundry room!
Everybody, down!
- You, down!

19:32.597 --> 19:34.600
But I think--

19:36.018 --> 19:38.770
You! And don't think!

19:47.489 --> 19:49.909
You and you, go to the next level!

19:54.999 --> 19:59.004
You know, the Chinese have the best
roasting methods in the world.

19:59.046 --> 20:02.049
I prefer the French one.

20:02.090 --> 20:04.383
Give me your lighter.

20:05.761 --> 20:08.096
What do they say, Johnny?

20:08.221 --> 20:11.933
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire.

20:20.236 --> 20:22.114
- Get 'em out of here!
- Go!

20:26.494 --> 20:29.247
Down, you piece of shit!

20:32.375 --> 20:35.336
- You're still with us, Johnny?
- Yes.

20:40.176 --> 20:43.262
All right, Johnny.
You wanna play?

20:43.388 --> 20:45.265
Give me a green one.

20:54.860 --> 20:58.279
No!

20:58.363 --> 21:01.450
Oh, shit!

21:07.875 --> 21:10.712
Go!

21:20.306 --> 21:22.016
You're dead.

23:03.759 --> 23:05.721
Shit!

23:35.922 --> 23:39.469
- He's gone.
- I can see that.

23:41.762 --> 23:43.638
He-- He got the cassette.

23:43.764 --> 23:45.808
So what?

23:45.933 --> 23:49.480
They show nothing but a fat degenerate
with some hooker killing him.

23:49.521 --> 23:53.735
- Except that--
- What?

23:53.818 --> 23:56.237
One-One machine
was still running.

23:56.321 --> 23:58.365
Fuck!

23:59.658 --> 24:02.954
Turn the city inside out.

24:03.080 --> 24:06.124
I don't care!
Find it!

24:06.249 --> 24:08.834
- Get the cassette!
- And kill him?

24:08.959 --> 24:11.129
No, bring him to me.
I want him alive.

24:11.254 --> 24:13.215
I'll kill him myself.
Go!

24:21.975 --> 24:25.981
Nothing's on one.
We're still looking. Shit.

25:09.905 --> 25:13.619
Gare de l'Est.
It's a train station.

25:13.619 --> 25:19.083
Take the direction Bibliotheque
until Chatelet. You change.

25:19.167 --> 25:23.465
And you take line number four and--
Yes, yes.

25:23.631 --> 25:27.010
Direction Porte de Clignancourt,
and you're right there.

25:27.051 --> 25:29.471
Okay? Yes.

26:16.693 --> 26:18.862
Excuse me.

27:23.770 --> 27:26.063
Thank you for coming.

27:26.189 --> 27:31.070
In the name of the president, I want
to personally apologize for this mess.

27:31.112 --> 27:34.240
I want to stress that we would
not want anything like this...

27:34.240 --> 27:38.455
to jeopardize the warm relation
and successful economic ties...

27:38.538 --> 27:40.499
shared by our two countries.

27:42.794 --> 27:45.128
So...

27:45.253 --> 27:48.548
we have assigned our best man
to supervise this case.

27:48.673 --> 27:54.223
He handled the Tehran incident
for us masterfully.

27:54.264 --> 27:57.267
There is no one more qualified
to bring this...

27:57.351 --> 27:59.687
to a mutually
beneficial conclusion.

27:59.687 --> 28:02.858
- Inspector Richard. Bonjour.
- Sir Minister.

28:02.983 --> 28:07.823
This is Minister Tang, our liaison
from the People's Republic of China.

28:07.864 --> 28:10.575
- It's an honor to meet you, sir.
- The honor is ours.

28:11.992 --> 28:14.121
The minister tells us
you are the best of the best.

28:14.287 --> 28:16.706
Well, the minister is too kind.
If that were true,

28:16.706 --> 28:19.126
I might have been able
to avoid this tragedy.

28:19.167 --> 28:22.172
I'm hoping that you might help us
understand what went wrong...

28:22.297 --> 28:24.174
so that we can avoid
further bloodshed.

28:24.299 --> 28:27.719
And hopefully, bring this matter to
a quick and satisfactory conclusion.

28:27.719 --> 28:29.764
If we could be showed the facts.

28:29.889 --> 28:32.143
Yes, of course.
Please.

28:33.436 --> 28:36.564
Uh, as you know,
as soon as you informed us...

28:36.605 --> 28:41.193
of the criminal activities
of the gangster Sung,
we set our operation in motion.

28:41.318 --> 28:43.779
We identified his heroin
smuggling routes into France.

28:43.904 --> 28:47.409
And in the spirit of cooperation,
we graciously accepted your offer...

28:47.492 --> 28:53.207
to have one of your people,
Liu Jian, come over...

28:53.333 --> 28:56.920
to assist us in Sung's arrest as he
was meeting with his French contact,

28:57.045 --> 29:00.341
who unfortunately
we haven't yet identified.

29:00.341 --> 29:02.595
Here...

29:02.636 --> 29:07.474
he is surveilling Sung as we were
waiting for the contact to arrive.

29:07.515 --> 29:11.520
And here, he's observing
along with us.

29:11.520 --> 29:15.734
And then, for some reason we still can't
understand, he went completely insane.

29:15.776 --> 29:17.737
Left the room to pee,
and next thing we know...

29:17.820 --> 29:21.824
he's knocked out the bodyguards,
killed Sung and the prostitute.

29:24.369 --> 29:27.123
This is the gun
he used to murder Sung.

29:27.248 --> 29:29.793
Chinese police issue.
Do you recognize it?

29:29.834 --> 29:32.253
- Yes.
- Good.

29:32.253 --> 29:35.173
Oh, we have also verified
his fingerprints on the weapon.

29:37.675 --> 29:42.390
Well, please, feel free to verify
our findings with your own people.

29:42.390 --> 29:45.393
We assume that your man was
part of the conspiracy--

29:45.393 --> 29:48.396
that he murdered Sung to
keep him from being captured...

29:48.396 --> 29:50.942
and testifying in your courts,
as you had requested.

29:50.983 --> 29:53.112
But that is only an assumption.

29:53.278 --> 29:55.239
We are hoping you could give us
some background on him...

29:55.280 --> 29:57.575
which would help us in his capture.

29:57.700 --> 30:01.245
Inspector Liu Jian was top in
all his classes at the academy.

30:01.286 --> 30:05.125
He received the highest training
in martial arts,
weapons and police tactics.

30:05.208 --> 30:08.419
He's been decorated for bravery
in the line of duty six times,

30:08.545 --> 30:12.384
been promoted five times,
and has never lost a case.

30:12.425 --> 30:14.386
He has no wife, no children.

30:14.427 --> 30:16.721
His only dedication
is to his work.

30:16.805 --> 30:19.267
He's our best,

30:19.308 --> 30:22.729
which is why
this is all so confusing.

30:22.855 --> 30:26.442
Well, you know, sometimes
the best are also the worst.

30:26.608 --> 30:28.485
It's really sad.

30:30.112 --> 30:33.115
Any surveillance cassettes?

30:33.198 --> 30:35.742
Destroyed as he made his escape.

30:35.784 --> 30:38.914
Do you know if he has any relatives
in Paris? Any friends or--

30:39.039 --> 30:41.584
He has no one.

30:41.625 --> 30:43.586
Well, then we should be able
to wrap this up very soon.

30:43.627 --> 30:45.756
Excuse me.

30:45.756 --> 30:46.757
Excuse me.

30:47.925 --> 30:51.847
I found the emergency phone.

30:53.056 --> 30:55.057
Oh, that's good news.

30:55.057 --> 30:57.351
Stay by the phone.
I'll call you back later.

31:01.064 --> 31:04.194
Inspector Richard,
we are very sorry...

31:04.235 --> 31:06.821
that the operation was sabotaged.

31:06.946 --> 31:11.160
I will report back to my superiors
and get you any help I can.

31:11.243 --> 31:13.955
- Thank you.
- Let me show you out.

31:18.503 --> 31:21.464
I want them followed.
I want their phones tapped.

31:21.547 --> 31:25.384
I want to know every move they make,
every word they speak.

31:25.510 --> 31:29.972
There must be a sleeper he's
staying with in Paris. Find him.

31:31.392 --> 31:33.269
So, I guess you will be staying...

31:33.394 --> 31:35.396
longer than you expected.

31:35.396 --> 31:37.982
A little longer.

31:38.066 --> 31:40.987
Paris is a nice city
once you get used to it.

31:44.699 --> 31:48.121
And the French are nice people
once you get used to them.

31:54.292 --> 31:57.255
- Are you hungry?
- No.

32:01.301 --> 32:03.721
Family recipe.
Very tasty.

32:18.154 --> 32:22.159
Fifty men on the street,
and you can't find this son of a bitch?

32:22.284 --> 32:25.288
- Did you try his hotel?
- The fuck never checked in.

32:25.329 --> 32:27.458
"The fuck never checked in."

32:27.583 --> 32:30.461
That means he has a friend in Paris,
or family. Even better.

32:30.586 --> 32:34.047
- Who tried Chinatown?
- Here. But it's hard to be discreet.

32:34.131 --> 32:37.887
So put on a wig and a kimono.
I don't care how you do it.
Now, get out. Get out!

32:37.928 --> 32:41.891
Get out! I want that little prick
in my office by tonight!

32:46.479 --> 32:48.814
Oh, Jessica, my love.

32:48.939 --> 32:50.901
Come to Papa. Come.

32:53.779 --> 32:56.073
Richard, I tried.

32:56.073 --> 32:58.952
I really tried.
I was only in the bathroom for a minute.

32:58.952 --> 33:02.373
You know, I was getting
ready to do my part--

33:02.457 --> 33:04.626
Getting ready to do what it was
that I said that I would--

33:04.667 --> 33:07.254
What you wanted--
I really-- I really--

33:07.379 --> 33:10.090
I really was ready to do what it was--
what you wanted--

33:10.174 --> 33:12.091
Jessica. Jessica.

33:12.175 --> 33:15.095
I know you were. I know, I know.

33:15.179 --> 33:17.807
Coming from such a quiet place
as North Dakota,

33:17.807 --> 33:20.101
you must have been so scared.

33:20.185 --> 33:22.772
- Richard, I tried. I-I--
- I know.

33:22.814 --> 33:24.816
- I tried. I really did.
- I know you did.

33:24.857 --> 33:29.571
All that noise.
My poor little farmer's daughter.

33:31.533 --> 33:33.535
Don't be scared.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.537
You're the best girl I have.

33:36.913 --> 33:39.290
And you know how
I treat my best girl.

33:40.416 --> 33:42.293
I know.

33:44.170 --> 33:46.715
So you'll keep your promise?

33:48.718 --> 33:50.720
Promise?

33:50.846 --> 33:53.432
Did I make a promise?

33:53.432 --> 33:56.436
Yes-- Yes. You said that
if I did it one more time,

33:56.520 --> 33:58.981
that you would let me--
let me have my daughter back.

33:59.022 --> 34:02.485
- You said that you'd help me
get the papers to get her out.
- Did I say that?

34:03.903 --> 34:07.739
- Yes.
- Did I say that, Max?

34:07.739 --> 34:09.742
Oh, yes, you did.

34:11.161 --> 34:13.746
Well, there you go.
Two to one.

34:15.916 --> 34:20.630
I guess you're right. So I'll have
to let you go, you and your precious.

34:24.760 --> 34:27.931
Do you realize how much I must trust you
to let you go just like that?

34:28.056 --> 34:31.768
With everything you know?
Everything you've seen?

34:31.893 --> 34:35.313
One phone call from you,
one word, and I'd be locked up
for the rest of my life!

34:35.355 --> 34:38.775
I'd never do that!
I'd never give you up, ever!

34:38.775 --> 34:42.239
I know that. If I didn't
trust you, would I let you go?

34:42.364 --> 34:47.077
- What is he doing?
- I don't know. What are you doing, Max?

34:47.077 --> 34:50.248
- I'm preparing a fix.
- He's preparing a fix.
Do you want a taste?

34:50.373 --> 34:52.960
Richard, I told you I quit.
You know I quit.

34:56.172 --> 34:58.091
I don't want it anymore!
I quit!

34:58.217 --> 35:01.093
You don't tell me when
you're gonna quit! I tell you!

35:01.219 --> 35:04.765
You don't tell me what you want!
I tell you!

35:04.848 --> 35:08.811
How long will it take
for a fucking junkie like you
to betray me for a lousy fix?

35:08.853 --> 35:11.105
I won't betray you!
Please, don't!

35:11.231 --> 35:14.985
"I won't betray you! Please, don't!"

35:37.971 --> 35:39.848
Put her back to work.

35:39.973 --> 35:42.100
Come on. Come on.

35:49.609 --> 35:53.738
Get the fuck out. Come on.
Move your fuckin' ass.

35:59.871 --> 36:04.626
Get to work, you fuckin' animals!
You cocksucking pigs.

36:30.948 --> 36:33.327
You play mah-jongg?

36:33.368 --> 36:35.454
A little.

36:35.496 --> 36:37.498
I love mah-jongg.

36:37.623 --> 36:39.668
Keeps the mind sharp.

36:39.793 --> 36:42.963
It's hard to find
good players around here.

36:43.088 --> 36:45.966
That's why I play by myself.

36:46.091 --> 36:48.802
This way, I always win.

36:50.763 --> 36:52.097
Bitch!

36:52.223 --> 36:54.808
I'm gone for five minutes,

36:54.935 --> 36:59.106
and you think you can park
your skinny ass in my spot?

36:59.190 --> 37:03.487
Fuck off!.
You want some more?

37:07.116 --> 37:09.702
She--

37:09.786 --> 37:12.540
She broke my nose!

37:12.581 --> 37:14.583
Come on! Look at you!

37:14.667 --> 37:16.584
- Ow!
- Eh?

37:17.877 --> 37:20.714
I haven't been home for 15 years.

37:20.798 --> 37:23.843
- Ow!
- That's a long time.

37:23.884 --> 37:26.931
- You stupid piece of shit.
- I have seven grandchildren.

37:30.434 --> 37:33.020
You are a fucking dog.

37:33.146 --> 37:35.024
All right?

37:35.149 --> 37:37.569
Get back to work.

37:41.614 --> 37:44.284
And one big girl 14 years of age.

37:44.325 --> 37:47.161
Almost a woman now.

37:47.287 --> 37:50.165
She wants to come to Paris.

37:50.291 --> 37:53.211
She goes to university.

37:53.336 --> 37:55.463
Hey! Go away!
Go away!

37:55.547 --> 37:59.010
- Please.
- You don't know these women.

37:59.051 --> 38:01.930
They say they want to use
the bathroom to pee,
and next thing they're shooting up.

38:02.055 --> 38:05.767
She only hurts herself.
Please, don't draw attention.

38:17.488 --> 38:20.075
Huh.

38:54.534 --> 38:56.786
Excuse me.

38:56.827 --> 39:00.289
- Can I use your toilet?
- No.

39:00.414 --> 39:03.668
Oh, please. I just--
I only have to pee. I won't be long.

39:03.709 --> 39:06.587
No!

39:06.712 --> 39:09.883
Okay.

39:13.263 --> 39:17.142
Wait!
What are you doing?

39:17.268 --> 39:19.562
Well, if you're gonna treat me
like a dog, I'm gonna act like a dog.

39:19.687 --> 39:22.524
- I'm gonna pee right here.
- Stop!

39:22.566 --> 39:25.152
Okay.

39:25.236 --> 39:28.322
There.

39:29.574 --> 39:31.575
Thank you. Thank you.

39:31.575 --> 39:33.870
Thank you so much.

39:37.123 --> 39:40.920
- But nothing else.
- I'm not gonna do
anything else, I promise.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.047
- Do you wanna check?
- No.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.759
- Just hurry.
- I'm sorry to have to force you to.

39:46.759 --> 39:49.764
It's just I have got to go so bad.
I really--

39:49.764 --> 39:52.183
- I'm only-- I'm only gonna be a minute.
- Okay.

39:57.648 --> 40:01.026
I'm Lo, the chef.
I came for my order.

40:01.067 --> 40:04.237
Oh! That feels so good.

40:07.326 --> 40:10.329
- How many?
- Uh, one, two,

40:10.370 --> 40:14.792
uh, three, four--

40:14.792 --> 40:18.339
- I owe--
- Don't worry about paying.
Come back later, okay?

40:18.464 --> 40:21.635
Come back later. Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.

40:26.805 --> 40:30.477
Miss, you have to finish now.

40:30.518 --> 40:33.396
Minute's up.

40:33.521 --> 40:36.109
You have to leave!

40:36.235 --> 40:38.195
Miss?

40:41.240 --> 40:43.284
Miss? Please.

40:56.215 --> 40:58.133
Miss?

41:04.559 --> 41:07.270
- I slept long?
- Only a minute.

41:07.311 --> 41:09.314
Oh, that's good.

41:09.439 --> 41:11.442
I've gotta get back to work.

41:11.568 --> 41:14.737
Every 15 minutes they come by in a
fuckin' car, and if I'm not out there--

41:14.821 --> 41:18.242
It's just that I'm so tired.
They gave me this shot and--

41:18.284 --> 41:21.327
Oh, my God.
Are you gonna finish this?

41:23.037 --> 41:26.000
- This is pretty good.
Did you make this yourself?
- Yes.

41:26.041 --> 41:29.170
- Is that what you do, then?
You cook, huh?
- No.

41:29.254 --> 41:31.757
- But you make these chips, right?
- My uncle does.

41:31.757 --> 41:34.594
I love those chips. Do you mind?
I love the pink ones.

41:34.719 --> 41:38.056
My daughter loves the blue ones.
That's her favorite color.

41:38.056 --> 41:40.393
Miss, you really have to go now.

41:40.476 --> 41:42.770
Mmm!

41:42.854 --> 41:44.772
Delicious. I'm sorry.

41:44.898 --> 41:47.066
- It's not every day I get to eat
in a Chinese restaurant.
- Here.

41:47.150 --> 41:49.360
One for you
and one for your daughter.

41:49.485 --> 41:53.197
Oh, my God.
This is so nice.

41:53.239 --> 41:57.787
You're the first person that's been
kind to me since I've been in Paris.

41:57.913 --> 42:00.916
Look, I-I-- I don't like
to take things from people.

42:00.957 --> 42:03.669
Usually I like
to pay my own way, so...

42:03.794 --> 42:07.174
maybe later on,
if you wanna, you know--

42:08.634 --> 42:11.930
- No charge?
- No. Thank you.

42:11.971 --> 42:13.931
I don't have any other way
to repay you.

42:13.972 --> 42:17.684
- Don't worry.
- I'm not your type. Is that it?

42:17.809 --> 42:19.938
I don't have type.

42:23.817 --> 42:25.945
Miss?

42:25.986 --> 42:28.573
I'm sorry for hitting you.

42:30.116 --> 42:32.119
That's okay.
I'm used to it.

43:11.706 --> 43:47.165
Kittana in one hour.

44:13.403 --> 44:15.405
He's on board.

44:16.531 --> 44:18.409
Let's go.

44:35.595 --> 44:37.847
Tell me everything.

44:39.141 --> 44:42.271
Richard, the cop in charge,
set up the whole thing.

44:43.981 --> 44:47.735
- He is the connection.
- Do you have proof?

44:49.154 --> 44:51.031
They recorded everything.

44:51.156 --> 44:55.035
They said that, uh,
you destroyed all the cassettes.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.746
Except one.

45:00.583 --> 45:02.585
Hand it to me, carefully.

45:16.477 --> 45:20.064
The main thing now is to get you
out of the country. I have a car.

45:20.190 --> 45:22.359
We can go to the airport,
and from there we can--

48:04.714 --> 48:08.259
Shit!
He's under the bridge!

48:16.103 --> 48:18.438
Get out!

48:41.548 --> 48:44.468
Block the north side!
I'll cover the south!

49:09.205 --> 49:11.083
Go! Go!

50:54.036 --> 50:55.912
Will this be a problem?

50:56.038 --> 50:59.083
With a billion of them,
do you think they'll miss one or two?

50:59.208 --> 51:03.005
The embassy's asking for the release
of his personal effects.

51:09.305 --> 51:13.517
Send them a big wreath of flowers...
with my condolences.

51:13.643 --> 51:16.104
How much should I spend?

51:16.104 --> 51:18.689
This much.

51:21.233 --> 51:24.696
Here are your assistant's
personal effects, and here...

51:24.821 --> 51:28.409
are some photos of your hero
killing another Chinese citizen...

51:28.534 --> 51:30.787
on the French soil.

51:30.828 --> 51:33.540
There's a time for diplomacy
and a time for action.

51:35.126 --> 51:38.129
Diplomacy is dead.

51:51.268 --> 51:54.147
- You should go to the hospital.
- Do you have a needle and thread?

52:13.294 --> 52:15.588
You know, since I began my work...

52:15.588 --> 52:18.759
I have received five
of you young men.

52:18.884 --> 52:22.014
Fast, proud-- like you.

52:23.598 --> 52:26.184
Four have died--

52:26.310 --> 52:29.690
the last one right in my arms.

52:31.317 --> 52:35.613
Before my time is up here,
I would like to send one home alive.

52:39.325 --> 52:42.704
I'll go for some bandages
and disinfectant for you.

52:52.507 --> 52:54.509
Hi.

53:09.234 --> 53:11.236
- Need any help?
- No.

53:11.320 --> 53:14.324
I have some experience.

53:14.366 --> 53:17.662
You know, the longer that
that thing stays open,

53:17.787 --> 53:22.084
the more risk there is of infection
setting in, and then you are in for it.

53:22.167 --> 53:25.546
I once had a scrape I ignored.
I let it go for a couple days.

53:25.630 --> 53:27.965
- It turned into staph infection.
- All right!

53:30.719 --> 53:33.012
But only to sew it.

53:33.096 --> 53:36.349
- Then you must leave. Okay?
- Yeah.

53:39.395 --> 53:42.107
Doesn't like me standing outside, huh?
Your uncle.

53:43.441 --> 53:45.444
Well, I don't blame him.
If I were him,

53:45.444 --> 53:47.863
I wouldn't like me
standing out there either.

53:47.947 --> 53:50.408
Now, this is gonna sting.

53:54.038 --> 53:56.416
Believe me, if I had any other
place to stand, I would.

53:56.457 --> 53:59.293
It's just all the good spots
get taken by the others and--

53:59.293 --> 54:03.715
You would not believe how much business
some of these girls do.

54:03.756 --> 54:06.300
- Guess how much
some of them do in a day.
- I don't know.

54:06.300 --> 54:09.139
- Well, guess.
- I can't.

54:09.180 --> 54:11.766
- Sure you can. Pick a number.
- Five.

54:11.891 --> 54:14.894
Five? How about 25?

54:15.020 --> 54:17.606
- Twenty-five?
- Mm-hmm.

54:17.690 --> 54:20.694
That's the record.
But at least 15.

54:20.777 --> 54:22.904
- Can you believe that?
- No.

54:22.904 --> 54:27.784
Yeah. Me? I'm lucky
if I can do five in a week.

54:27.909 --> 54:31.496
- You ever been with a hooker?
- No.

54:31.621 --> 54:34.792
- Not even once?
- No.

54:34.792 --> 54:38.088
- Are you gay?
- No.

54:38.213 --> 54:41.176
That'd be okay if you are.
I think everyone should be
who they want to be...

54:41.217 --> 54:43.636
- and do it with who
they want to do it with.
- I'm not gay!

54:43.720 --> 54:46.640
All I'm saying is, I don't hold
nothin' against nobody that way.

54:46.766 --> 54:49.311
- Are you finished?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:49.394 --> 54:51.355
There.

54:52.647 --> 54:55.649
Mmm. Here you go.
Good as new.

54:57.486 --> 55:00.113
Oh, my God. Look at that scar.
Let me see.

55:00.238 --> 55:04.077
I'm fine. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

55:07.247 --> 55:10.250
You did a very good job.

55:10.376 --> 55:12.338
I used to sew up pigs.
That was my specialty.

55:12.380 --> 55:17.677
Used to have this big, fat mama sow,
and she tore herself along
the barbwire when...

55:17.677 --> 55:20.263
she was trying to get to the other side
of the fence to get at these apples.

55:20.389 --> 55:25.518
- You gonna be around long?
- No. I go home as soon
as my business is over.

55:25.559 --> 55:27.561
Hmm. And so,
what is your business,

55:27.687 --> 55:30.566
- if you don't mind me asking?
- Shrimp.

55:30.692 --> 55:33.361
Oh, yeah.
Pretty aggressive shrimp.

55:33.403 --> 55:36.448
You should probably be
more careful.

55:36.573 --> 55:39.953
- No wife?
- No.

55:39.994 --> 55:41.955
Haven't met the right girl,
I bet.

55:41.996 --> 55:44.959
- Right?
- My work-- It's hard to meet any girls.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.586
Any interest in
an ex-junkie hooker...

55:48.712 --> 55:52.883
who can cook, clean, sew
and who likes Chinese food?

55:52.967 --> 55:54.885
No, thank you.

55:54.885 --> 55:57.389
I'm just kidding.

55:57.431 --> 55:59.391
Hey, look.

56:03.896 --> 56:06.024
See? My daughter.

56:08.611 --> 56:13.033
- My angel. Sweet, huh?
- Yes.

56:15.076 --> 56:19.205
Why do you do this kind of...job?

56:19.289 --> 56:22.042
Well--

56:25.505 --> 56:27.924
There was this guy, and, uh,

56:28.050 --> 56:31.387
I met him after I had my baby.

56:31.512 --> 56:34.933
And where I come from, girls without
husbands just do not have babies.

56:34.933 --> 56:36.935
And if they do, well,
it's kinda hard on 'em.

56:36.935 --> 56:40.023
So, anyway, this guy I met--
He's this French guy.

56:40.065 --> 56:42.941
He's really cool
with this great accent...

56:42.941 --> 56:45.527
and always talking about art and books
and movies and everything.

56:45.652 --> 56:49.783
And, boy, when you're, you know--

56:49.824 --> 56:52.787
When you're young and really desperate,
you know, this--

56:56.375 --> 57:00.045
And this guy could really--
I mean, he could talk. You know?

57:00.128 --> 57:02.256
And so-- I don't know.

57:02.340 --> 57:06.095
The next thing you know,
you're on the street.

57:07.262 --> 57:10.682
Why don't you just... quit?

57:12.393 --> 57:14.520
It's a little more complicated
than that.

57:14.561 --> 57:17.856
What do you mean?

57:27.703 --> 57:31.290
I should probably get back.
See you later.

57:36.547 --> 57:38.589
Nice talking to you.

57:38.715 --> 57:42.845
- Lupo!
- Practicing embroidery on the clients?

57:42.886 --> 57:45.973
No, no, he's not--

57:46.015 --> 57:49.185
Lupo, he was just--
He had a cut on his arm.

57:49.185 --> 57:52.314
I thought he was gonna call the medics,
and they'd be blocking off the street,

57:52.440 --> 57:54.900
and then the clients couldn't come,
and I couldn't be standing on my spot,

57:55.025 --> 57:58.740
and I couldn't make any money for you,
so I thought if I just took
five minutes, then--

57:58.823 --> 58:03.745
Shh.
Get back to work.

58:03.786 --> 58:07.331
Lupo, he had nothing
to do with--

58:07.498 --> 58:10.626
I said, get back to work!

58:12.628 --> 58:14.924
Excuseme.

58:19.512 --> 58:23.018
I'm really sorry to interfere
in your business.

58:23.060 --> 58:27.647
But I would really appreciate it...

58:27.773 --> 58:31.069
if you...

58:31.110 --> 58:34.654
don't do that again.

58:36.323 --> 58:38.242
The little statue speaks.

58:38.326 --> 58:42.247
You know, I don't care
if you fuck her, bleed on her.

58:42.373 --> 58:46.086
You're still using her time,
and her time is my money.

58:46.086 --> 58:48.088
You've kept her busy
for 20 minutes.

58:48.129 --> 58:52.760
- Do you know the going rate
for 20 minutes?
- No.

58:54.096 --> 58:56.264
Five hundred francs.

59:12.699 --> 59:17.581
Ah! Five for her time,
now five for mine.

59:31.011 --> 59:33.014
My kind of client.

59:35.184 --> 59:37.437
Lupo, we should get back--

01:00:38.967 --> 01:00:40.969
Hello, Max?

01:01:13.298 --> 01:01:15.174
Fuck!

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:34.615
What happened?

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:38.453
Down!

01:02:08.237 --> 01:02:10.656
Fuck!

01:02:35.561 --> 01:02:37.562
Ah! Damn-- F-- Oh!

01:02:41.983 --> 01:02:44.278
Oh, God!

01:02:48.117 --> 01:02:51.704
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

01:02:51.704 --> 01:02:52.705
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

01:02:53.248 --> 01:02:55.835
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:02:55.876 --> 01:02:58.713
What're we gonna do?
What're we gonna do?

01:02:58.713 --> 01:03:01.716
Respect his wishes.

01:04:12.465 --> 01:04:14.467
Listen.

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:17.806
The longer you keep information from me
about this psychopath you sent over,

01:04:17.931 --> 01:04:20.475
the longer my city will bleed
innocent blood.

01:04:20.558 --> 01:04:22.811
I assure you, Inspector,
we have kept no information from you.

01:04:22.852 --> 01:04:25.939
Good.

01:04:32.403 --> 01:04:35.867
- What're we gonna do now?
- I don't know.

01:04:35.867 --> 01:04:38.829
- I can't walk the streets all night.
- Walking helps me think.

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:41.707
- Walking hurts my feet.
- Then go home.

01:04:41.833 --> 01:04:44.086
Oh, just like that.
First you put me in this mess,

01:04:44.128 --> 01:04:46.421
and then you think
you can just get rid of me.

01:04:46.463 --> 01:04:48.423
I put you in this mess?

01:04:48.466 --> 01:04:50.802
You were the one
who came to the shop to pee.

01:04:50.885 --> 01:04:53.178
You were the one
who offered to sew me up.

01:04:53.303 --> 01:04:55.597
I didn't ask you for anything!

01:04:55.722 --> 01:04:58.852
I only asked to be left alone.

01:04:58.893 --> 01:05:02.022
Oh, yeah, that's you--
don't need anything, don't need anybody.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.734
Just have yourself and your stupid job
selling shrimp chips.

01:05:06.278 --> 01:05:08.155
I don't sell shrimp chips.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.159
Yeah, I figured that out. I mean,
I'm stupid, but I'm not that stupid.

01:05:11.284 --> 01:05:13.829
- I'm a cop.
- I'm Santa Claus.

01:05:13.954 --> 01:05:15.873
Who is Santa Claus?

01:05:15.914 --> 01:05:18.584
A big fat guy, red suit,
flying reindeer?

01:05:18.624 --> 01:05:21.336
Jesus, God,
don't you know anything?

01:05:23.714 --> 01:05:26.633
Take me here.

01:05:29.346 --> 01:05:31.640
Why do you want to go there?

01:05:31.724 --> 01:05:35.519
The best thing to do. When you lose
your way, you go back to the beginning.

01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:37.899
Beginning?
Beginning of what?

01:05:38.065 --> 01:05:40.359
My work. Last night.

01:05:44.156 --> 01:05:46.616
You-- You were there last night?

01:05:46.657 --> 01:05:50.077
Working with the French cop.

01:05:50.077 --> 01:05:52.664
- Richard?
- You know him?

01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:55.960
Yeah. I was there too.

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:58.379
The redhead.

01:05:59.965 --> 01:06:02.384
Yeah. No, it was a wig.
It was--

01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:05.972
- Come on.
- Wait a minute!

01:06:06.056 --> 01:06:09.560
- A second ago you couldn't
wait to get rid of me.
- You're my proof.

01:06:09.685 --> 01:06:12.563
I will take you to the embassy,
and you will tell them everything.

01:06:12.688 --> 01:06:16.109
No, no. I'm in deep enough.
I'm not gonna be your witness.

01:06:16.234 --> 01:06:18.402
You're the only one
who can save me.

01:06:18.486 --> 01:06:20.404
Don't you listen?

01:06:20.488 --> 01:06:22.783
Richard has my daughter.

01:06:22.825 --> 01:06:24.786
But you don't think about that,
do you? No!

01:06:24.828 --> 01:06:27.539
You don't think about
what's gonna happen to her,
what's gonna happen to me.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.958
Of course not!
You only think of your job.

01:06:29.999 --> 01:06:33.421
That's all that matters to you,
because that's all you've got
in your crummy cop's life.

01:06:33.547 --> 01:06:36.591
You take Richard down, and it's just
gonna leave a space for another bastard,

01:06:36.716 --> 01:06:39.011
one who we pray will be less of
a bastard than the one before him.

01:06:39.137 --> 01:06:41.012
And that's reality!

01:06:41.138 --> 01:06:46.726
Maybe it's not your reality,
but it's my reality every day, 24-7.

01:06:46.852 --> 01:06:51.441
And there's nothing you or anybody else
can do to change that.

01:06:51.483 --> 01:06:53.443
Wait.

01:06:53.485 --> 01:06:56.739
If I get your daughter back,
will you help me?

01:06:56.739 --> 01:07:01.036
I'm-- I'm--
I'm really screwed this time.

01:07:01.036 --> 01:07:04.833
My government will protect you.
They will give you safely away.

01:07:04.875 --> 01:07:07.835
Away where?
To China?

01:07:07.918 --> 01:07:11.590
I mean, I like the chips,
but no, thank you.

01:07:11.631 --> 01:07:14.759
Listen to me.

01:07:14.843 --> 01:07:19.641
I know you've had some bad experiences
trusting people.

01:07:19.766 --> 01:07:22.769
But if I gave you my word,

01:07:22.895 --> 01:07:25.063
you will be safe.

01:07:28.068 --> 01:07:30.362
Yes, Minister.

01:07:30.488 --> 01:07:32.948
We're doing all we can, Minister.

01:07:33.073 --> 01:07:37.077
But we are not magicians
who can pull killers out of hats
like they're rabbits,

01:07:37.077 --> 01:07:40.498
especially one
who is trained like this.

01:07:40.539 --> 01:07:43.503
I'm just a cop trying
to do his job. Yes.

01:07:46.088 --> 01:07:47.799
I'll call you back.

01:07:47.924 --> 01:07:51.470
Richard! My God, Richard!
You're not gonna believe this.

01:07:53.932 --> 01:07:55.850
Try me.

01:07:59.188 --> 01:08:01.398
I-- This crazy little Chinese--

01:08:01.524 --> 01:08:05.610
Lupo picked the perfect spot,
except it smelled like shrimps.

01:08:05.693 --> 01:08:07.988
And how can I get any clients
when I smell like a shrimp?

01:08:08.072 --> 01:08:12.536
So anyway, I was trying to work,
and Max and Lupo come along.

01:08:12.577 --> 01:08:15.706
They went into the shop,
and the next thing I know,

01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:19.711
the little fucker goes nuts,
you know, and-and-- I mean--

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:23.424
Max tried to protect me,
and the Chinese guy killed both of them.

01:08:23.424 --> 01:08:26.010
I believe you.

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:29.721
And then?

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:32.015
And then he takes me as a hostage.

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:36.104
He made me carry this stuff,
and he dragged me all the way
up to that church--

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:38.316
You know, the big church
on the top of the hill?

01:08:38.441 --> 01:08:40.443
And then-- You know--
And he made me...

01:08:40.443 --> 01:08:44.156
help him do these things-- these weird
things with incense and pajamas.

01:08:44.281 --> 01:08:48.120
- And every time I tried to run--
- He stopped you?

01:08:50.747 --> 01:08:53.041
Yeah.

01:08:53.167 --> 01:08:55.502
You know--
You know those movies...

01:08:55.627 --> 01:08:58.755
with that Chinese guy who's always
kicking and screaming all the time and--

01:08:58.839 --> 01:09:01.593
- He used kung fu on you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:01.634 --> 01:09:04.930
He did. Look.

01:09:07.224 --> 01:09:09.185
Wow.

01:09:12.522 --> 01:09:15.526
And then he made me go to this
restaurant while he ate this goop...

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:20.073
with weird things in it, you know,
like snails and frogs' legs and--

01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:22.783
That is when you escaped
out of the bathroom window?

01:09:22.868 --> 01:09:26.497
- When he fell asleep.
- In the restaurant?

01:09:26.497 --> 01:09:29.500
He-- Yeah.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:32.962
Richard.

01:09:33.087 --> 01:09:36.091
Please, don't-- don't do that.

01:09:43.559 --> 01:09:47.104
Do you think he is still there
in the restaurant?

01:09:49.483 --> 01:09:54.695
Well, he drank a whole lot of beers.
That's why I came here.

01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:57.866
- 'Cause I thought if I helped you--
- What?

01:09:57.991 --> 01:10:00.495
I could show you where he is.

01:10:00.537 --> 01:10:06.210
- You're not too tired?
- Oh, yeah, for sure.
I could probably sleep for a week.

01:10:06.293 --> 01:10:09.548
But, I don't know. I--

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:13.427
You want me to come?

01:10:13.553 --> 01:10:15.847
I don't know.
What do you think?

01:10:15.888 --> 01:10:20.643
I think... I should come.

01:10:20.726 --> 01:10:23.020
I think you should stay.

01:10:24.730 --> 01:10:28.862
Okay. He's-- He's at
the Mandarin in Belville.

01:10:28.987 --> 01:10:31.447
But-- But I'll do whatever you want,
though. I mean, I just--

01:10:31.573 --> 01:10:33.867
I want you to trust me.

01:10:35.326 --> 01:10:38.165
I trust you.

01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:40.667
Ow! Wait. Wait.

01:10:43.587 --> 01:10:47.549
And if I discover I can't,
I know where to find you.

01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:56.602
What about my daughter?

01:10:58.312 --> 01:11:01.441
She's safe, just like her mother.

01:11:01.482 --> 01:11:03.444
Watch her.

01:11:34.396 --> 01:11:39.401
So, what's a girl gotta do
to get fed around here?

01:11:43.197 --> 01:11:45.783
Okay. Okay.

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:52.124
Wait a minute. What do you think I am,
the village idiot?

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:54.878
No. First you go get my sandwich,

01:11:55.003 --> 01:11:57.715
and then I give you your dessert.

01:13:01.788 --> 01:13:04.499
Hello?

01:13:04.625 --> 01:13:06.502
Hello?

01:13:06.544 --> 01:13:09.882
- Don't do that!
- You get it?

01:13:09.965 --> 01:13:13.177
No, I always walk around handcuffed to
a steam pipe with a turtle for company.

01:13:13.219 --> 01:13:15.222
So you didn't get it.

01:13:15.222 --> 01:13:18.809
Is it just you, or do all cops
lack a basic sense of humor?

01:13:18.809 --> 01:13:21.103
Now will you help?

01:13:21.103 --> 01:13:23.232
Relax your arm.

01:13:23.398 --> 01:13:26.944
I can't relax it anymore.
Come on, you know about handcuffs.

01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:30.822
- You sure you got all of them?
- The deal was I get you all
the tapes in his office.

01:13:30.822 --> 01:13:34.034
Are you gonna live up to your end
of the bargain or what?

01:13:34.117 --> 01:13:36.955
Are you listening?
Hello!

01:13:38.123 --> 01:13:40.834
- No, no. No needles.
- No needles. No.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.128
Ow!

01:13:45.256 --> 01:13:47.843
- How did you do that?
- Chinese magic.

01:13:47.885 --> 01:13:50.137
- Let's go to the embassy.
- No.

01:13:50.263 --> 01:13:53.267
- First we get my daughter.
- No, first the embassy,
then I get your daughter.

01:13:53.308 --> 01:13:56.894
Bullshit. I'm not gonna sit someplace
safe while my kid's life's in danger,

01:13:57.019 --> 01:13:58.980
so forget it!

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:07.448
Which way?

01:14:12.538 --> 01:14:15.166
She escaped?

01:14:15.166 --> 01:14:17.628
What do you mean she escaped?

01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:21.549
How could she escape?

01:14:25.344 --> 01:14:27.263
It's here.

01:14:42.032 --> 01:14:43.909
See you around.

01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:48.497
What is this place?

01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:50.582
It's an orphanage.

01:14:51.917 --> 01:14:53.210
- Do you mind?
- What?

01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:54.502
- Do you mind?
- What?

01:15:12.943 --> 01:15:15.487
Oh, no.

01:15:15.529 --> 01:15:17.655
Shit.

01:15:19.532 --> 01:15:21.409
Oh, come on.

01:15:25.665 --> 01:15:28.126
There it is.
Section "B," bed 13.

01:15:28.252 --> 01:15:30.128
Okay.

01:15:45.854 --> 01:15:48.566
What's wrong?

01:15:48.607 --> 01:15:51.987
I don't know.
I guess I'm kinda nervous.

01:15:52.028 --> 01:15:55.241
I mean, I haven't seen her
in almost a year.

01:15:55.324 --> 01:15:57.451
Then don't make her wait.

01:15:57.451 --> 01:15:59.161
Go.

01:17:07.532 --> 01:17:10.410
Ow!

01:18:10.565 --> 01:18:14.194
- Are you okay?
- I don't think so.

01:18:46.191 --> 01:18:47.943
Somebody help me!

01:19:32.159 --> 01:19:34.037
Here, sweetie.

01:19:34.162 --> 01:19:37.583
That's for boys.
Don't you have any Barbies?

01:19:37.749 --> 01:19:40.420
All my Barbies are working.

01:19:43.882 --> 01:19:46.885
I had a turtle,
but your mother took it.

01:19:49.888 --> 01:19:52.057
When am I going to see my mommy?

01:19:52.182 --> 01:19:54.059
Soon, darling.

01:19:55.185 --> 01:19:58.065
Very soon.

01:20:00.192 --> 01:20:02.904
My daughter?

01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:05.909
Calm down.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:20:05.909 --> 01:20:07.952
But he has my daughter.

01:20:08.077 --> 01:20:10.371
And we have them.

01:20:10.496 --> 01:20:13.208
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:18.296
No. You don't understand.

01:20:18.379 --> 01:20:20.633
My life is not some fairy tale.

01:20:20.674 --> 01:20:23.093
My life is hell.

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:25.221
Richard is the devil,

01:20:25.347 --> 01:20:28.225
and he has my daughter,
and he's gonna kill her,

01:20:28.225 --> 01:20:30.227
and then he's gonna kill me.

01:20:30.353 --> 01:20:34.107
And then he's gonna find a way
to get out of it clean.

01:20:34.232 --> 01:20:37.654
You're wrong.
They will arrest him,

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:41.115
and they'll take care of you
and your daughter.

01:20:41.199 --> 01:20:43.826
"They"? "They"?

01:20:43.952 --> 01:20:47.830
I don't give a shit about them.

01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:50.959
I don't trust them.

01:20:53.255 --> 01:20:55.632
I trusted you.

01:20:57.717 --> 01:21:02.724
For the first time in--
God, I don't know, forever--

01:21:02.849 --> 01:21:05.644
I don't know why I trust someone.

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:10.857
You promised you'd
take care of her.

01:21:10.857 --> 01:21:14.069
Yes.

01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:20.452
You're tired.
I think you should sleep.

01:21:58.205 --> 01:22:01.208
- Hello?
- I want the child.

01:22:04.045 --> 01:22:06.589
- I want the cassette.
- I gave the cassette to my government.

01:22:06.631 --> 01:22:11.219
- They will know what to do with it.
- Bad move, Johnny Boy.

01:22:11.386 --> 01:22:13.932
Now that the kid has no value,

01:22:14.098 --> 01:22:16.643
what am I going to do with her?

01:22:16.768 --> 01:22:19.229
She's too young to work.

01:22:19.313 --> 01:22:21.775
Maybe not.

01:22:21.816 --> 01:22:26.237
- What do you think?
- I think you should come to the window.

01:22:36.332 --> 01:22:40.253
Now I know where you are.
I'm coming up.

01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:48.973
He's coming up.

01:22:55.105 --> 01:22:57.565
Hey, monsieur--

01:23:02.862 --> 01:23:04.739
Sound the alert!

01:23:56.634 --> 01:23:58.677
Fight!

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:09.469
Come on! Come on!
Get those out!

01:25:09.594 --> 01:25:12.181
Move it! Move it!
This is not a drill!

01:25:12.265 --> 01:25:14.182
Go now!

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:54.772
Ah, Johnny, Johnny,
I'm disappointed in you.

01:28:54.897 --> 01:28:59.068
Coming to Paris for the first time,
and instead of enjoying yourself,

01:28:59.193 --> 01:29:01.364
you're doing all this useless
running around.

01:29:01.489 --> 01:29:05.493
- I don't like to get bored.
- Me either.

01:29:05.618 --> 01:29:08.788
And right now I'm finding you
very boring!

01:29:08.915 --> 01:29:10.459
Wait!

01:29:12.794 --> 01:29:15.297
You're making a big mistake.

01:29:15.339 --> 01:29:17.508
- Ah, really?
- In the second...

01:29:17.633 --> 01:29:19.718
it takes for you to kill her,

01:29:19.801 --> 01:29:22.804
I will have all the time I need
to kill you.

01:29:28.228 --> 01:29:31.774
I got you.

01:29:31.815 --> 01:29:33.943
Yes, you did,

01:29:34.027 --> 01:29:36.405
but I also got you.

01:29:41.828 --> 01:29:45.247
Isabel?

01:29:45.373 --> 01:29:47.625
I'm a friend of your mom.

01:29:47.667 --> 01:29:51.088
Can you wait outside?

01:29:51.129 --> 01:29:53.340
Okay.

01:30:00.974 --> 01:30:02.976
Good-bye, mister.

01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:15.574
What did you do to me?

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.452
I put a needle in your neck.

01:30:18.577 --> 01:30:24.127
- That's it?
- In a certain point, very forbidden.

01:30:24.168 --> 01:30:27.296
It's called
"The Kiss of the Dragon."

01:30:27.296 --> 01:30:30.593
Kiss my ass!

01:30:30.677 --> 01:30:33.722
The blood from your whole body
goes to your head.

01:30:33.847 --> 01:30:37.435
It stops there, never comes down.

01:30:38.728 --> 01:30:42.522
But soon it will come out
from your nose,

01:30:42.522 --> 01:30:47.611
your ears,
even from your eyes.

01:30:47.611 --> 01:30:52.785
And then...
you will die, painfully.

01:30:55.496 --> 01:30:57.916
You're really a smart guy,
Johnny Boy.

01:30:58.042 --> 01:31:01.755
My name is not Johnny.

01:32:02.825 --> 01:32:06.870
- I slept long?
- Only a minute.

01:32:14.422 --> 01:32:16.298
My daughter?

01:32:17.305 --> 01:32:23.209
