A UNIVERSE WHOSE DIMENSIONS

03:52.399 --> 03:55.892
ARE THE SIZE, THICKNESS, LENGTH
OF THE SVVATH OF BANDAGES

THAT COVER HER FACE. IN A MOMENT,
VVE'LL GO BACK INTO THIS ROOM.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.777
AND ALSO, IN A MOMENT, VVE'LL
LOOK UNDER THOSE BANDAGES,

THAT VVE'RE NOT TO BE
SURPRISED BY VVHAT VVE SEE,

04:07.164 --> 04:08.950
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T
JUST A HOSPITAL,

04:09.040 --> 04:11.293

<i>(doctor) WELL, IT'S' WARM
THIS' EVENING, MISS' TYLER.</i>

04:41.364 --> 04:44.356
YES, I THOUGHT IT WAS,
BUT I COULDN'T BE SURE.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.782
<i>IT'S VERY WARM.</i>

04:45.869 --> 04:47.860
<i>TAKE MY WORD
FOR THAT.</i>

04:47.954 --> 04:51.197
<i>WE'LL HAVE THOSE BANDAGES
OFF YOU VERY SOON.</i>

04:51.291 --> 04:53.999
<i>I EXPECT YOU'RE
PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE.</i>

04:54.085 --> 04:56.543
WELL, I'M USED TO
BANDAGES ON MY FACE.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.418
<i>I HAVE NO DOUBT. IT'S
YOUR NINTH VISIT HERE.</i>

04:59.508 --> 05:02.045
<i>IT IS THE NINTH?</i>

05:02.135 --> 05:05.002
THE 11th.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.007
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES I,

05:07.098 --> 05:10.966
I THINK I'VE LIVED MY VVHOLE
LIFE INSIDE OF A DARK CAVE

05:11.061 --> 05:12.802
WITH WALLS OF GAUZE,

05:12.896 --> 05:15.513
AND THE WIND THAT BLOWS
INTO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE

05:15.607 --> 05:19.020
SMELLS OF ETHER
AND DISINFECTANT.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.647
OF COURSE THERE'S A,

05:21.738 --> 05:27.233
THERE'S A KIND OF A COMFORT
LIVING INSIDE THIS CAVE.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.410
WONDERFULLY PRIVATE.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.989
NOBODY CAN EVER SEE ME.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.038
IT'S HOPELESS,
ISN'T IT, DOCTOR?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.665
I'LL NEVER LOOK ANY
DIFFERENT THAN NOW.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.088
<i>WELL, THAT'S
HARD TO SAY.</i>

05:42.175 --> 05:47.511
<i>UP TO NOW, YOU HAVEN'T RESPONDED

<i>FRANKLY, YOU'VE STUMPED
US, MISS TYLER.</i>

05:54.437 --> 05:56.690
<i>NOTHING WE'VE DONE
SO FAR HAS MADE</i>

05:56.773 --> 05:58.229
<i>ANY DIFFERENCE
AT ALL.</i>

05:58.316 --> 06:01.058
HOWEVER, WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL

06:01.152 --> 06:04.895
FOR VVHAT THIS LAST TREATMENT
MAY HA\/E ACCOMPLISHED.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.483
THERE'S NO TELLING, OF COURSE,
TILL VVE GET THE BANDAGES OFF.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.318
I'M SORRY YOUR
CASE IS NOT ONE

06:10.412 --> 06:13.200

06:23.008 --> 06:26.342
NO MORE AFTER THIS,
DOCTOR. NO MORE TRIES.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.635
11 IS THE MANDATORY
NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.384
WE'RE NOT PERMITTED

<i>NOW WHAT, DOCTOR?</i>

06:33.310 --> 06:35.802
VVELL, YOU'RE KIND OF JUMPING
THE GUN, AREN'T YOU?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.388
YOU MAY HAVE RESPONDED

<i>THERE'S NO WAY OF TELLING

<i>WELL, THERE

<i>WHY THESE RULES

<i>TO FIT IN
WITH SOCIETY.</i>

07:05.508 --> 07:07.966
<i>IN YOUR CASE,
THINK OF THE TIME</i>

07:08.053 --> 07:10.090
<i>AND THE MONEY
AND THE EFFORT</i>

07:10.180 --> 07:12.012
<i>EXPENDED TO

<i>NORMAL. THE WAY

DOCTOR.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.729
MAY I WALK OUTSIDE?

07:28.823 --> 07:30.689
PLEASE, MAY I?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.617
MAY I JUST GO AND,
AND SIT IN THE GARDEN?

07:33.703 --> 07:35.489

JUST, JUST TO MAKE BELIEVE I AM NORMAL?
(almost crying)

07:45.715 --> 07:48.833
IF, IF I SIT OUT THERE
IN THE DARKNESS,

07:48.927 --> 07:51.043

MEDICALLY POSSIBLE,

11:51.294 --> 11:53.205
EVERYTHING
HUMANLY POSSIBLE

11:53.296 --> 11:55.537

YOU CROSS YOUR FINGERS

11:55.632 --> 11:57.964

FORA MIRACLE.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.587

I'VE, I'VE LOOKED
UNDERNEATH THOSE BANDAGES.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.448

IT'S HORRIBLE.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.666

I UNDERSTAND,

12:53.564 --> 12:55.180
BUT I MUST CONFESS,

12:55.275 --> 12:58.939
IT'S EASIER FOR ME
TO THINK OF HER AS HUMAN

12:59.028 --> 13:01.486
WHEN HER FACE
IS COVERED UP.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.188
BUT WHY?

13:03.283 --> 13:06.821
WHY MUST WE FEEL
THAT WAY, NURSE?

13:06.911 --> 13:08.697
VVHAT IS THE
DIMENSIONAL DIFFERENCE

13:08.788 --> 13:11.701

SOMETHING REPELLENT?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.532
IS IT SKIN DEEP?

13:13.626 --> 13:16.709
OH, LESS THAN THAT.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.333
WHY, NURSE?
