<i>♪ Ooh, ooh ♪</i>

00:48.256 --> 00:49.799
So, let me get this straight.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.926
You were belly dancing on the beach

00:52.010 --> 00:56.431
and decided that you needed to cool off
by going skinny-dipping,

00:56.514 --> 00:58.850
and you forgot
where you left your clothes.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.853
Oh, my God, I am having
such a<i> </i>déjà vu right now.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.899
Maybe one of those beagles
swooped down and took it.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.400
You mean a seagull.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.278
-No, maybe I mean an eagle.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.529
-Yeah. Oh!
-Oh!

01:11.613 --> 01:13.031
-Hey!
-Look at that.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.076
-There she be!

01:16.159 --> 01:18.536
Great.
Now all we have to do is find your top.

01:18.661 --> 01:23.625
Okay, we're looking for two gold nipple
graduation cap thingies.

01:23.708 --> 01:24.626
Tassels?

01:24.709 --> 01:27.045
Grace, you have a word for everything.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.798
There actually are words for everything.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.175
You crack me up.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.136
Oh, okay.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.971
-So funny.
Yeah.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.848
You're like a dictionary.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.351
There's a beagle!

01:41.434 --> 01:42.936
Or is it an eagle?

01:43.520 --> 01:46.397
No, it's the other one you said.
Shoo! Shoo!

01:46.981 --> 01:50.401
The Santa Fe light
has so much to teach me, Jacob.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.655
It's like you think you know
what a cactus looks like,

01:53.738 --> 01:59.327
but then, the light says,
"Look again, lady. You don't know."

02:00.829 --> 02:05.458
Honey, Tai Chi is all about hearing
what the Zen masters called

02:05.542 --> 02:07.210
"the soundless sound."

02:07.335 --> 02:09.420
-Of course!

02:11.840 --> 02:12.924
Sorry.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.971
It's just so big.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.932
I'm not sure how I'd walk into my house--

02:21.015 --> 02:23.017
Now available in travel size!

02:23.143 --> 02:25.395
Fits discreetly into your purse.

02:25.478 --> 02:28.022
Or in the seat-cubby of your walker.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.233
Ooh. Great!

02:34.696 --> 02:37.699
I love your jackalope. It moves me.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.159
I feel the fur.

02:39.242 --> 02:42.120
And thank you
for this gorgeous eggplant, Fred.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.371
You're so welcome.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.125
That's your fourth sale today.
Santa Fe loves you.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.918
It really does.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.254
-Ooh.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.009
Hey, Grandma.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.886
No, it's Frankie.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.470
About to be known as Grandma.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.347
<i>Oh, hush, hush, hush, hush.</i>

03:01.431 --> 03:03.558
You can't call me that yet.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.352
Two more months,
and even then, not Grandma.

03:06.436 --> 03:10.064
I'm trying to decide between
Mee-maw, Gabba-Gabba, or Adele.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.401
Oh, good, I was hoping Santa Fe
would make you weirder.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.987
Yeah, but a weekend with you
will level me out.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.198
<i>Oh, God, I'm thrilled that Bud and Allison</i>

03:18.281 --> 03:21.534
are having this ridiculous
whatever-it-is party so I can see you.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.660
<i>Me, too.</i>

03:22.785 --> 03:25.997
But a gender reveal party
is not ridiculous, Grace.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.709
I mean, obviously, we're also gonna need
to have a gender decision party

03:29.792 --> 03:31.211
when the child is 12.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.295
Can't wait.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.256
Oh, Frankie, remember you're gonna be
in the guest room.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.633
Sheree's in the studio now.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.177
Why can't the lodger sleep
somewhere else?

03:39.260 --> 03:41.971
Because the "lodger"
is paying us actual rent.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.058
<i>Oh, and Frankie,</i>
<i>you need to sign her lease.</i>

03:45.767 --> 03:47.227
<i>What time do you land tomorrow?</i>

03:47.310 --> 03:49.479
My plane gets in at 12:20.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.981
Oh, well, you're definitely gonna
miss that flight.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.441
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

03:53.524 --> 03:55.235
And most likely the one after that.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.319
Good chance.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.529
<i>So I'll meet you at the airport</i>

03:58.613 --> 04:00.949
three flights after the one
you were supposed to come in on.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.992
I feel so known.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.496
I told you, Sol, you can't block
the entrance to the Build-A-Bear.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.581
Those kids and creepy adults
get very angry.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.000
But we did good this time, Terry.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.337
Channel Seven was there.
They put us on the midday news.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.424
I'm sure it was a hit with all the pets
whose owners left the TV on for them.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.636
Eyeballs, Robert.
It's all about the eyeballs.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.806
Now Tallwater Commons
will be known as the mall

04:24.889 --> 04:26.849
that kicked out two women for kissing.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.977
Don't you guys usually do these protests
with a big group?

04:29.060 --> 04:32.105
We do. Dedicated resistance fighters all.

04:32.188 --> 04:35.108
So how come you two are
the only ones who ever get arrested?

04:35.191 --> 04:38.611
-They're younger. They can run.
-Yeah.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.697
<i> Oh, I'm so glad to be home,</i>

04:40.780 --> 04:45.660
and I can't believe that I haven't even
talked to my grandbaby in utero yet.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.036
Little help here?

04:47.120 --> 04:51.749
Oh, there's so much to teach him/her
before he/she even gets born.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.168
Frankie, what the hell
do you have in here?

04:54.294 --> 04:57.672
Oh, just some highly-personalized
chunky turquoise jewelry

04:57.755 --> 05:01.134
I bought for everyone
from the world's greatest city.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.219
That must have set you back
a pretty pumpkin.

05:04.262 --> 05:09.267
So? Did you sign up for that dating site
I signed you up for?

05:09.350 --> 05:12.312
Yes. And oddly enough,
I didn't find the love of my life

05:12.395 --> 05:14.522
on Hippie-Round-Up-dot-com.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.983
You've got to open up your mind, Grace.

05:17.066 --> 05:20.320
-Old hippies are the best lovers.
-Well, Sol's an old hippie.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.072
He was always a very giving lover.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.867
If a bit distracted.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.411
Like the time he called me "Robert."

05:29.037 --> 05:32.457
Which, in retrospect,
makes a lot of sense.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.418
-Did Robert ever call you--
-No!

05:35.501 --> 05:36.753
Did he ever say, "That's all,"

05:36.836 --> 05:39.839
but what he was really saying was,
"That's Sol"?

05:39.922 --> 05:41.382
There was no talking.

05:41.466 --> 05:45.636
No, it was all a very silent,
separate experience.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.222
Everyone was left to their own thoughts.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.558
Which is why you need an old hippie.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.643
They bring the ruckus every night.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.896
Well, my ruckus is just fine, thank you.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.647
Oh, really?

05:56.898 --> 05:59.692
Are you seeing someone?
Are you holding out on me?

05:59.776 --> 06:05.114
No! No! No, no, no, of course not, no.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.783
How are you and Jacob doing?

06:06.908 --> 06:08.076
Oh, he's a dream.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.244
He takes me camping in the desert,

06:10.328 --> 06:12.246
he makes breakfast for me every morning,

06:12.330 --> 06:13.748
he reads to me every night.

06:13.831 --> 06:17.460
And he didn't even mind
when I adopted a pack of stray dogs.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.421
So it's working out perfectly.
That's what I figured.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.673
I'm happy for you, Frankie.

06:22.757 --> 06:23.591
Thank you.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.552
Do you know anyone
who wants a stray dog?

06:26.636 --> 06:28.971
Hey, hon,
I'm back with the groceries!

06:29.055 --> 06:30.681
-Sheree.

06:30.765 --> 06:31.766
Who's "hon"? I'm "hon."

06:32.975 --> 06:35.394
What happened to my pet name for you?

06:35.978 --> 06:37.688
"Kevin" never really caught on.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.650
Oh, there she is!

06:41.067 --> 06:44.487
Oh, the famous Frankie.
I feel like I know you already.

06:45.113 --> 06:49.117
Can I give you a hug
We don't have to hug.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.243
Okay, let's not. Yes, we do.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.248
It's a good thing
I'm not allergic to rhinestones.

06:55.623 --> 06:56.958
Oh, that is a good thing.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.252
Sheree's cooking dinner in your honor.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.046
So it'll be the three of us for dinner?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.173
I'm making my famous chicken pot pie.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.260
It's deep-fried so you don't even
taste the vegetables.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.345
Also, there aren't vegetables in it.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.263
Huh.

07:10.346 --> 07:13.433
I can honestly say it's
the most delicious thing I ever tasted.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.893
Well, to be fair, you are new to food.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.312
That's great, Sheree,

07:18.438 --> 07:19.814
but unfortunately, I'm a vegan.

07:19.897 --> 07:24.861
Grace told me already, so I'm making
a fried potato pot pie for you.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.821
And if it sounds rich,

07:27.780 --> 07:30.324
you're welcome to work it off with us
on Dance Night.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.202
Wait. You dance?

07:34.162 --> 07:35.288
Like, for joy?

07:35.371 --> 07:38.124
I don't know who Joy is,
but can she do this?

07:38.624 --> 07:40.418
<i>♪ Bam, bam, bam, bam ♪</i>

07:40.501 --> 07:42.670
<i>♪ Ah, bam, bam, bam, bam ♪</i>

07:42.753 --> 07:45.256
<i>-♪ Ah, ooh, ah ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Ooh, ooh, ah ♪</i>

07:45.381 --> 07:48.176
Great!

07:51.554 --> 07:52.847
-Hey!
-Hi.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.432
Sharon still thinks I work here.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.267
Asked me to get toner
for the copy machine.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.144
-Which you did.
-Which I did.

07:58.227 --> 08:00.897
But I drew the line
at changing out the water cooler.

08:01.022 --> 08:01.856
No, you didn't.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.357
No, I didn't.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.943
How'd your interview go with Lauren?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.487
It was really good.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.198
-Do you know she and her husband--
Yeah.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.366
-Lauren and Loren. It's perverse.
-It's cute.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.701
It's not cute. You're right.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.912
If you don't want me taking a job
with a competitor--

08:15.995 --> 08:17.955
She's not my competitor,
she's my nemesis.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.832
She said very nice things about you.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.460
-She said you were smart and funny.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.129
Barry, Barry, Barry... that is her game.

08:25.213 --> 08:29.050
She plays all cute and cuddly
until she rips your face off.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.927
Did she tell you
about the first time we met?

08:31.052 --> 08:32.261
I was wearing a yellow skirt,

08:32.386 --> 08:35.932
and then the next time I saw her,
she was wearing a yellow skirt.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.519
We talked mainly about tax law.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.396
-She's a bitch, Barry.
-Okay, she's a bitch.

08:43.564 --> 08:44.815
I'll see you at home.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.403
Big old bitch!

08:51.697 --> 08:54.283
If you need to pee, you need to pee.
Just go.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.161
I am not going in that thing, Sol.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.121
Nobody cares if you pee. Right, guys?

08:59.205 --> 09:00.414
Shut the fuck up!

09:01.916 --> 09:04.335
-Those two idiots.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.128
-It's fine.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.965
We're always out of here
in a couple hours. I'll just hold it.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.552
I don't want to say anything,
but I told you to go before the protest.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.970
I did!

09:14.053 --> 09:16.305
And if you hadn't insisted
I stay hydrated

09:16.389 --> 09:18.849
and bought me that Jamba Juice,
I'd be fine.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.856
Uh, Terry?

09:25.940 --> 09:29.610
I can't let Robert use the employee john
again. I got in trouble last time.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.322
No worries. But do you know
when we're getting released?

09:33.781 --> 09:36.742
I need an ETA so he doesn't get a UTI.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.995
I'm sorry, Sol. Nobody gets processed
over the weekend,

09:39.078 --> 09:40.621
so you're in for the night this time, pal.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.590
Guess what?

09:51.966 --> 09:54.677
If you're gonna say "cheddar biscuits,"
I'm gonna love you forever.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.345
You're gonna love me forever.

10:00.474 --> 10:05.313
Did I just see you and Sheree do
a<i> Top Gun</i> high

10:05.396 --> 10:06.355
Yeah.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.817
I've been trying to get you to do
a<i> Top Gun</i> high-five for years.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.070
With her, it's natural.
You want it too much.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.324
When did you two get so close?

10:16.407 --> 10:18.618
She's been doing my nails for 20 years.

10:19.535 --> 10:20.995
We enjoy each other.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.913
She had no place to go
when her husband died.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.708
She has no children, no family.
So, she needed a friend.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.586
I didn't realize she had no family.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.716
Oh-ho-ho.
-Sheree, I'm so sorry about your husband.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.093
That's really sweet of you.

10:36.427 --> 10:40.848
It was a pretty tough go there,
but Grace was a godsend.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.225
Oh, no, you're the godsend.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.479
You're good company,
you cook, you clean,

10:46.562 --> 10:47.688
you clean while you cook.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.857
I can get touch-ups anytime I want.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.318
This is a real nail artist.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.736
-Oh...
-That's so great.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.280
I'm more an artist artist.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.323
-Show her.
-Oh, no.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.492
No. Come here. She's modest.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.620
Look at this. Look at that.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.206
My God. What is that, Guantanamo Bay?

11:05.289 --> 11:07.083
It's the view from our house.

11:08.292 --> 11:10.378
-Now I see it.
-It's beautiful.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.465
So, Grace, shouldn't we talk
about the business?

11:14.924 --> 11:17.385
You know, forecasts,
market-what-have-yous,

11:17.843 --> 11:20.096
the update on the Santa Fe office.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.598
Yeah, how are things
in our "Santa Fe office"?

11:22.682 --> 11:25.768
Oh, well, lots of politics.
A hornet's nest.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.646
I'm sorry, Sheree, we have to do this.

11:28.729 --> 11:31.565
No, Sheree doesn't mind.
In fact, she has a good head for it.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.235
It was her idea for me
to do the pop-up store in her salons.

11:34.652 --> 11:39.407
Well, sure, all kinds of ideas pop up
now that we're established.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.992
You know, Grace and I
fought the early battles.

11:42.076 --> 11:45.788
We had to take on
this evil corporate raider

11:45.871 --> 11:47.915
with these dastardly eyebrows.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.168
Well, I'm not a business person like you.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.420
Well...

11:52.503 --> 11:54.380
Nobody's a business person like her.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.173
No one.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.927
Well, if you are interested,
I do have another idea.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.471
How about selling them on cruises?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.724
Fancy older people love cruises.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.142
Well, that is genius.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.810
The early bird buffets!

12:07.935 --> 12:09.520
Adult extension courses!

12:09.603 --> 12:10.521
Tom Hanks movies!

12:10.604 --> 12:13.941
-Oh! I love Tom Hanks!
-I know. Everybody does.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.318
How does he do it every single time?

12:16.402 --> 12:17.820
He's always good.

12:17.903 --> 12:21.490
Am I the only one here
who has seen<i> Larry Crowne?</i>

12:27.997 --> 12:29.206
I'm sorry. I...

12:30.916 --> 12:32.293
I've got jet lag.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.627
You gained an hour.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.963
I'm just gonna chill
in my meditation room.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.548
Frankie!

12:37.631 --> 12:40.801
No, no, it's the one place
that really returns me...

12:41.802 --> 12:42.845
to myself.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.472
-I'll be right back.
-Yeah.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.516
-Holy fu--

12:48.642 --> 12:49.643
Keep it down.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.813
What happened here?

12:52.897 --> 12:57.860
I know it's a bit much, but Sheree makes
all those little figurines herself.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.404
She painted them with nail polish.
See the one of me?

13:02.823 --> 13:04.533
Looks just like you, Kevin.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.839
I think last night took misery
to a new level.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.177
You might want to think about
one of those sleep apnea machines.

13:29.683 --> 13:35.022
Terry, we really have to be somewhere
by 1:00 today.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.691
Did you make said request
upon booking your room?

13:37.775 --> 13:41.904
Very funny. But I need to find out
the sex of my son's baby.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.906
Holy shit, Bud's having his kid today?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.242
Well, not today.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.620
-Today is his gender reveal party.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.039
I didn't know
he was making that choice.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.124
No, no, no, his baby's.

13:54.583 --> 13:58.254
Nowadays young people celebrate
finding out their baby's sex.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.797
Oh, so it's like a baby shower?

13:59.880 --> 14:02.258
It's a party before the baby shower.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.885
Do you get him a present
or how does that work?

14:05.302 --> 14:06.387
I don't know.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.390
Robert, did we get him anything?

14:09.473 --> 14:10.808
Jesus!

14:10.891 --> 14:12.851
Okay, that's it. We're out of here.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.812
I'm doing
what we should have done last night.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.814
-No.
-We are calling Judge Hempstead.

14:16.897 --> 14:17.773
We can't.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.569
It's wrong to use our connections
as two privileged white men.

14:21.652 --> 14:25.531
Call the damn judge so I don't have
to hear another fucking word

14:25.614 --> 14:27.408
about the gender reveal party.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.911
And, yes, you should bring a present.
Balloons are nice.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.749
It's Judge Hempstead.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.919
H-E-M-P-S-T-E-A-D.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.845
Hello, miniature lodger.

14:47.928 --> 14:50.180
It's Sunday. Time for church.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.770
Oh, no!

14:56.896 --> 14:58.898
Jacob, I'm so sorry!

14:58.981 --> 15:02.109
I'm on my way to the airport right now.
Please don't be mad.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.904
<i>Frankie, we agreed</i>
<i>I'd take a taxi from the airport</i>

15:04.987 --> 15:07.072
because you wouldn't remember
to pick me up.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.490
<i>What? Yeah.</i>

15:08.574 --> 15:09.992
Uh, no doubt. No doubt.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.452
<i>Anyway, I'm taking a later flight.</i>

15:11.535 --> 15:14.955
I ended up giving my seat away.
Some lady had a service animal.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.082
Ha! All those people are all con artists.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.126
I don't know, Frankie,
she was pretty blind.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.754
Oh. Good on you. Good on you.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.881
So, how was your girls' night with Grace?

15:23.964 --> 15:26.508
You could have come with me yesterday.
We didn't have our night.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.218
The lodger crashed it.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.555
And get this, Grace wants to give
the lodger a lease.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.808
But she's very nice.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.608
What the hell happened to your face?

15:43.275 --> 15:46.278
Girl Scouts get really pissed
when you only buy one box.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.196
What?

15:48.364 --> 15:49.615
Why are you laughing?

15:49.698 --> 15:51.158
No, it's make-up, Mal.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.243
Look.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.330
Nadia's been practicing on me
for her make-up artist class.

15:57.039 --> 16:01.502
Last Saturday night she gave me
chicken pox and a smoky eye.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.296
You two really need to start having sex.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.839
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.007
-I know.
-Mm-hmm.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.301
Only six more weeks
till she gets her one-year chip.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.553
And I'm doing this the right way.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.888
Sometimes doing the right thing

16:12.972 --> 16:14.848
will give you an even greater high
than drugs.

16:15.724 --> 16:16.600
Really?

16:17.893 --> 16:18.727
No.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.563
Not at all.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.400
Where are the kids?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.777
Um, it's Mitch's weekend at the house.

16:26.860 --> 16:29.196
-They seem to be doing fine.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.991
Yesterday, they got upset when he couldn't
take them to soccer practice.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.869
But it turns out it's just because Daddy
got a new car that they wanted to ride in.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.037
What kind of car?

16:37.621 --> 16:38.580
Porsche.

16:40.541 --> 16:41.417
Oh.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.961
Yeah. He's getting laid, isn't he?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.754
-Like a doctor in a Porsche.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.757
Great. That's really
what I want to think about.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.012
Mal, um, if you can't take me home,

16:53.095 --> 16:55.222
is there any chance
that Mitch could pick me up?

16:56.223 --> 16:57.349
Wow.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.351
That's really cold.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.398
-Hi.
-Morning!

17:06.984 --> 17:10.320
No, but I put Rolos in them.

17:14.408 --> 17:18.245
Mmm. Listen, Sheree, Rolo muffins aside...

17:18.579 --> 17:22.374
but to be clear, this does change
everything we know about muffins...

17:23.208 --> 17:24.793
how is Grace holding up?

17:24.877 --> 17:25.919
Oh, she's doing great.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.755
Well, she acts like she's doing great,

17:27.838 --> 17:30.507
but when I left, she was,
frankly, devastated.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.926
You don't have to worry about our friend.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.471
I'm here for her,
and she's got that great guy.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.141
A guy?

17:39.767 --> 17:42.144
Right. I love that guy.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.854
What's not to love?

17:44.229 --> 17:45.814
He's loaded, he's handsome.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.443
Right, I love that rich, handsome guy

17:49.735 --> 17:53.113
with the, uh... face.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.617
Oh! That fine face. And that hair.

17:57.493 --> 18:01.789
And, uh, okay, what the hell,
I'm just gonna say it... that ass.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.880
-So bad.
-Um...

18:09.963 --> 18:11.465
How do you pronounce his name?

18:11.548 --> 18:13.675
It's so hard on the phone,

18:13.967 --> 18:16.804
with all the syllables,
the different spellings...

18:17.262 --> 18:20.516
I think it's pronounced Nick.

18:20.641 --> 18:21.767
Nick.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.977
N-I-C-K.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.062
Nick.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.105
Nick.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.232
Of course, there could be an "H."

18:28.732 --> 18:29.983
Right. Right.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.402
Nick. Wait a minute.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.198
Is this him?

18:36.281 --> 18:37.241
No.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.701
That's a naked picture of you.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.956
Oh, my God. Wait.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.792
Is this him?

18:46.875 --> 18:50.003
That's another... picture of you.

18:50.963 --> 18:51.839
Oh.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.553
Oh, yeah. That's a Nick pic.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.722
I wonder if that's how
they came up with that term.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.225
Oh, my God.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.022
You are dating the guy
who tried to steal our business!

19:09.898 --> 19:13.777
He wasn't trying to steal our business.
It was just his way of flirting.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.363
Oh, like how Hitler flirted with Poland.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.450
How did you find out about Nick?
Have you been grilling my roommate?

19:20.534 --> 19:24.037
Well, someone has to start filling me in
on what's going on here.

19:25.038 --> 19:28.792
No.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.838
Okay, well, he's wrong for you
on every level.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.382
Why? Because he doesn't drive a car
that runs on millet?

19:35.507 --> 19:38.260
He is a soulless corporate monster!

19:38.886 --> 19:40.721
Well, I'm sorry
that I'm not dating a hippie

19:40.804 --> 19:44.057
who's still reeling from the break-up
of Creedence Clearwater Revival.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.226
They were brothers!
They should have worked it out!

19:46.310 --> 19:50.731
Look, it's no big deal, okay?
It's just casual between me and Nick.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.735
Has he been inside you?

19:56.778 --> 19:58.363
You make me sound like a fort.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.781
Well?

19:59.865 --> 20:04.411
-Yes.
-Oh, God, this is worse than I thought.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.538
Did I not have any effect on you?

20:07.080 --> 20:09.917
Because without me,
you have lost your bearings, lady.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.710
You're eating carbs, dancing.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.004
Where is that empty robot I left?

20:14.087 --> 20:15.631
See, that is the point!

20:17.132 --> 20:18.217
You left.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.928
It's so funny
how you keep forgetting that part.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.804
What is your problem?

20:23.138 --> 20:26.266
My problem is that you have erased me!

20:27.768 --> 20:29.519
I moved on, just like you did.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.855
Well, the way you moved on was all wrong.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.900
Well, according to you.
It's working for me.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.612
I mean, give me a break.
You're gonna get on a plane in two days.

20:38.695 --> 20:43.116
You don't have to worry about it,
so would you just sign the lease

20:43.200 --> 20:48.205
and give Sheree some security
and give me some peace of mind, please?

20:48.330 --> 20:50.415
You're right. I'm sorry.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.670
This is your house with Sheree now.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.923
Oh, my God, this is a 30-year lease!

20:58.006 --> 20:59.800
It's a three-year lease!

21:00.842 --> 21:02.678
I don't have my glasses.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.514
Just sign right here.

21:19.361 --> 21:25.117
"In other words,
the anti-feminist backlash was set off

21:25.200 --> 21:29.079
not by women's achievement
of full equality,

21:29.162 --> 21:34.126
but by the increased possibility
that they might win it."

21:34.209 --> 21:35.919
Now more relevant than ever, Mom.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.505
But perhaps it's time
to give Allison a little break.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.758
All right, but we've got to get started
reading<i> The Feminine Mystique.</i>

21:41.883 --> 21:43.844
I didn't get to read that to you
till later.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.138
Yes, but it still shaped me
as a four-year-old.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.889
Other kids had <i>Yertle the Turtle</i>,

21:47.973 --> 21:50.142
but I showed them
Betty Friedan was fun, too.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.727
Is this why you got beat up a lot?

21:51.810 --> 21:53.603
Well, also, I was Betty Friedan
for Halloween.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.730
-No.
-Yeah.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.939
-Three Halloweens in a row.
-No.

21:57.524 --> 21:58.734
-Ah!
-Ah!

21:58.817 --> 22:02.446
Oh.
-Ah!

22:02.529 --> 22:03.989
At least someone's happy to see me

22:04.072 --> 22:06.616
who did not run out
and get a new roommate.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.119
Well, actually, Barry moved in a week ago.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.203
-Oh, my God!
-Frankie.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.163
Barry!

22:11.705 --> 22:13.915
Oh, I am so out of the loop!

22:13.999 --> 22:16.793
How did she even get you
to come back to San Diego?

22:16.918 --> 22:18.879
-Really deep heart-to-hearts.
-Freaky sex stuff.

22:18.962 --> 22:23.800
Well, I feel terrible. I got everyone else
chunky turquoise jewelry except you.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.969
Oh, he can have mine.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.012
My turn!

22:27.095 --> 22:30.307
Ah! Oh!  Oh!

22:31.725 --> 22:35.103
T-minus ten minutes
until the reveal revelry begins!

22:35.187 --> 22:36.521
Yes!
-Yes.

22:36.605 --> 22:37.564
No.

22:44.237 --> 22:45.822
You guys are a little ripe.

22:46.239 --> 22:50.035
Sorry. We didn't have time to go home
and freshen up after prison.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.912
Oh, no. I've been there.

22:51.995 --> 22:54.164
But what's with the bologna smell?

22:54.247 --> 22:55.457
When we were on the inside,

22:55.582 --> 22:58.335
we used the sandwiches they gave us
as tiny pillows.

22:59.252 --> 23:00.796
You're getting really good at this.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.049
Coming from you that means something.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.134
Heartwarming father-son chat.

23:07.427 --> 23:10.347
I can feel his little behind.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.725
-Those must be his testicles.
-But those are my boobs.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.144
So sorry that I dragged you
into this awful

23:16.228 --> 23:20.440
Bud-Allison narcissistic "we're the first
people to ever have a baby" bullshit.

23:20.565 --> 23:21.483
Well, I'm okay with it.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.152
Just like I will be for the baby shower,
the baby-naming,

23:24.236 --> 23:25.570
not to mention the first birthday party.

23:25.654 --> 23:29.491
Seriously, how many times do we have
to celebrate that Allison took a load?

23:29.574 --> 23:30.867
You are such a romantic.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.829
I've taken a million loads.
Nobody's ever thrown a party for me.

23:33.912 --> 23:37.499
-So just tell me when you want to leave

23:37.624 --> 23:39.376
and we will get out of here
whenever you want.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.460
Thank you.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.379
Okay.

23:44.297 --> 23:45.841
-I'm okay.

23:46.424 --> 23:47.384
Cool.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.511
-Okay, stop it.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.971
Let's go back to the group.

23:51.054 --> 23:54.057
If I lived here, my hands
would never leave this belly.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.183
Oh, that's nice.

23:55.642 --> 23:58.019
Is there anything I can get for you?

23:58.395 --> 24:00.063
Well, there is one thing...

24:00.856 --> 24:01.773
Can I?

24:03.233 --> 24:04.276
Please, God, not here.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.404
She gets whatever she needs.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.326
-Ew! Ew, ew, ew!
-Bud, no!

24:13.451 --> 24:16.997
It's a pregnancy thing. Okay?
She likes to inhale the pheromones.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.249
Thanks, babe. I just needed a quick hit.

24:19.332 --> 24:22.294
There's no way
I am going to get through this sober.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.879
Oh, God, I miss this.

24:24.004 --> 24:27.007
Like, you miss this specifically?

24:27.090 --> 24:29.009
Well, yeah, it's part of the pregnancy.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.927
I don't want to miss a thing.

24:31.344 --> 24:34.347
What if you decide to get married
on the spur of the moment?

24:34.472 --> 24:35.640
We're not there yet, Mom.

24:35.724 --> 24:39.019
Yeah, we have like 17 baby parties
to get through first.

24:39.102 --> 24:41.313
Frankie, are you still stashing
up in your studio?

24:41.396 --> 24:43.815
There are five. Five more parties.

24:45.358 --> 24:46.318
Okay.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.323
I want one of those.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.367
You never drink this early.
What's the matter?

24:57.204 --> 24:58.496
Mitch got a sex car.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.081
And?

25:01.166 --> 25:04.544
He's a doctor in a Porsche, Mom.
He's clearly on the prowl.

25:04.628 --> 25:09.257
Look, correct me if I'm wrong,
but didn't you choose to leave him?

25:09.799 --> 25:11.468
Well, yeah, but...

25:11.551 --> 25:14.846
Why is everybody whining
about decisions they made?

25:15.388 --> 25:17.474
God, you and Frankie, what a pair.

25:17.557 --> 25:20.227
I'm not whining. I'm lamenting.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.729
You know what you should be? Fuming.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.815
Anger solves everything.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.318
No, no, no. I am no good at getting angry.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.321
Oh, you're my daughter.
It's in your blood.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.742
You want to take your emotions
and crush them into a diamond

25:35.825 --> 25:38.245
and hurl them at the person you're mad at.

25:38.995 --> 25:40.622
And then you can move on.

25:43.541 --> 25:46.795
Thanks, Mommy.
You're always so good at the mushy stuff.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.133
...armpit. It's just...

25:54.219 --> 25:57.597
Oh, my God.

25:58.348 --> 26:01.351
I feel like I walked into a cupcake...

26:01.434 --> 26:02.769
on the Serengeti.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.022
We're gonna have to get high
just to match this room.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.649
Where is it again?

26:07.774 --> 26:10.026
Behind the shingle with the hook.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.613
Where's my drafting table?

26:14.739 --> 26:16.616
And where's my pleather couch?

26:17.534 --> 26:22.163
Oh, my God. She got the vindaloo stain
out of the ceiling.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.000
Goodbye, character.

26:26.459 --> 26:30.005
Frankie, I get that it's a little weird,
but you had to see this coming.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.549
Well, maybe not this exactly.

26:32.632 --> 26:35.260
I don't think anyone
could have predicted this.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.178
What do you think of Sheree?

26:37.679 --> 26:40.473
She's nice. Mom seems good.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.226
Yeah. She does.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.855
Are you gonna hang
onto that joint all day?

26:48.148 --> 26:50.650
Is this the same stuff
from when I ruined Thanksgiving

26:50.775 --> 26:53.028
by talking in an Australian accent
the whole night?

26:53.778 --> 26:55.614
Please pass the kangaroo, mate.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.575
-It still makes me laugh.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.286
What are you reading, nosy?

27:01.703 --> 27:03.163
A deposition.

27:03.246 --> 27:04.497
About what?

27:04.581 --> 27:06.082
About Sheree.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.085
From her stepson.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.089
And here's another one...

27:15.175 --> 27:16.843
from her stepdaughter.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.055
I didn't know that she had stepchildren.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.849
Neither does Grace.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.394
Hmm. That is a little weird.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.314
Holy shit.

27:30.231 --> 27:32.525
Holy shit.
