>> NURSE: Ready to go, so I'm

41:23.133 --> 41:25.133
gonna walk in with you.
If you, uh...

41:25.133 --> 41:27.133
>> KOURTNEY: So, I get up?
>> NURSE: Step down on that

41:27.133 --> 41:28.700
side.
All right, perfect.

41:28.700 --> 41:30.700
And we'll have you go out to the
waiting room, and then we'll

41:30.700 --> 41:32.467
take good care of her.
>> LARSA: Okay.

41:32.467 --> 41:34.066
>> LARSA: All right, bye.
I love you.

41:34.066 --> 41:50.066
>> KOURTNEY: Bye.
♪ ♪

41:50.066 --> 41:54.066
>> KIM: Who do we have here?
Kendall.

41:54.066 --> 42:02.100
Cutie.
Oh. Oh, hey.

42:02.100 --> 42:04.734
Guys, I'm gonna say this is a
really (bleep) proud moment in

42:04.734 --> 42:09.734
my life.
In Macy's, giant-sized cutouts

42:09.734 --> 42:13.200
of every family member.
>> KOURTNEY: What do you think

42:13.200 --> 42:17.700
about this? (laughs)
>> KIM: Wait, so, how was your,

42:17.700 --> 42:20.600
um, how was your retrieval?
How many did you get out?

42:20.600 --> 42:22.500
>> KOURTNEY: I got out seven.
>> KIM: That's a lot.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.100
That's exactly how many I got
out.

42:24.100 --> 42:25.734
>> KOURTNEY: It is?
>> KIM: Yeah.

42:25.734 --> 42:29.066
>> KOURTNEY: I got out eight,
but two they said weren't good,

42:29.066 --> 42:32.200
and then they incubated them,
and they got one out of the two.

42:32.200 --> 42:34.600
So I got seven.
>> KIM: Oh, that's amazing.

42:34.600 --> 42:38.200
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
The procedure was much easier

42:38.200 --> 42:41.734
than I thought, so I'm really
happy about that.

42:41.734 --> 42:44.467
I mean, I just feel good.
Like, life is good.

42:44.467 --> 42:47.734
I have the insurance if I want
to have kids, or maybe I'll

42:47.734 --> 42:50.767
never use them.
But I think it's just nice to

42:50.767 --> 42:53.200
have.
It's something that, like, gives

42:53.200 --> 42:56.667
me peace of mind and I don't
have to worry about, and I think

42:56.667 --> 42:59.734
it was all worth it, and I'm
just happy that it's done.

42:59.734 --> 43:02.767
>> KIM: Wait, was it easier than
you thought it was gonna be?

43:02.767 --> 43:05.633
>> KOURTNEY: Way easier.
way easier than I

43:05.633 --> 43:07.233
thought.
>> KIM: That's amazing.

43:07.233 --> 43:09.233
>> KOURTNEY: So, I don't think I
need to do it again.

43:09.233 --> 43:11.033
>> KIM: Definitely, you don't
need to do it again.

43:11.033 --> 43:13.500
You don't need that many.
>> KOURTNEY: No. If anything...

43:13.500 --> 43:15.700
>> KIM: 100%. You don't need
any more.

43:15.700 --> 43:17.700
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KIM: I'm really proud of

43:17.700 --> 43:20.500
Kourtney taking the real steps
to freeze her eggs.

43:20.500 --> 43:23.133
But I think it's just, like, all
really symbolic.

43:23.133 --> 43:26.133
Making good decisions and moving
forward and putting herself and

43:26.133 --> 43:29.667
her own happiness first.
Let's take a pic by mine real

43:29.667 --> 43:31.467
quick.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.233
>> KIM: Like this?
Is this my pose?

43:36.233 --> 43:38.767
Oh, but I'm like this.
>> MAN: Got it.

43:38.767 --> 43:45.066
>> KIM: Cool.
On the next episode...

43:45.066 --> 43:47.600
>> KANYE: What? Put 'em here.
I'm the one and only Kanye

43:47.600 --> 43:49.734
West.
(ringtone playing)

43:49.734 --> 43:52.333
>> KIM: Hello?
What?

43:52.333 --> 43:54.000
right
now.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.266
When he gets ramped up, he can't
control what he says.

43:57.266 --> 44:01.033
You know, Alice Johnson, the
only person that could get her

44:01.033 --> 44:03.266
out of prison would be the
president.

44:03.266 --> 44:06.266
We have one shot to plead our
case.

44:06.266 --> 44:09.533
Alice, you're out.
