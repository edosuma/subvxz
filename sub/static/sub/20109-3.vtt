WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:04.572
Rick: Morty?!

00:04.605 --> 00:06.240
Morty!
- Rick?

00:06.274 --> 00:08.709
- Hey, Morty?!
- Rick?

00:08.742 --> 00:11.412
Are you far away,
or are you inside something?

00:11.445 --> 00:13.081
Is this a camera?

00:13.114 --> 00:14.648
Is everything a camera?

00:14.682 --> 00:16.317
Rick:
Morty, the garage, Morty.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.319
Come to the garage!

00:18.352 --> 00:19.387
Morty?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.021
Rick?
W-where are you?

00:21.055 --> 00:22.423
On my work bench, Morty.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.192
Are you invisible and you're
gonna, like, fart on me?

00:24.225 --> 00:25.226
Flip the pickle over.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.727
What, I'm gonna touch it,

00:26.760 --> 00:28.562
and you're gonna tell me it's
an alien dick or something.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.098
Come on, flip the pickle, Morty.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.033
You're not gonna regret it.
The payoff is huge.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.236
I turned myself
into a pickle, Morty!

00:35.269 --> 00:37.438
Boom! Big reveal...
I'm a pickle.

00:37.471 --> 00:38.706
What do you think about that?

00:38.739 --> 00:40.574
I turned myself into a pickle!

00:40.608 --> 00:42.610
W-what are you just
staring at me for, bro.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.178
I turned myself
into a pickle, Morty!

00:44.212 --> 00:45.513
And?
And?

00:45.546 --> 00:47.115
What more do you want
tacked on to this?

00:47.148 --> 00:49.883
I turned myself into a pickle,
and 9/11 was an inside job.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.519
Was it?
Who cares, Morty?

00:51.552 --> 00:53.121
Global acts of terrorism
happen every day.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.194
Uh, here's something
that's never happened before...

00:55.223 --> 00:56.557
I'm a pickle.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.959
I'm Pickle Rick!

01:00.994 --> 01:04.831
**

01:34.695 --> 01:37.565
Are you going to,
I mean, you know,

01:37.598 --> 01:39.500
is this the first part
of some magic trick?

01:39.533 --> 01:41.669
I don't do magic,
Morty, I do science.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.771
One takes brains, the other
takes dark eye liner.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.773
Well, can you move?
Can you fly?

01:45.806 --> 01:47.175
I wouldn't be much
of a pickle if I could.

01:47.208 --> 01:50.344
All right, well, do pickles
live forever or...

01:50.378 --> 01:53.514
Morty, stop digging for hidden
layers and just be impressed.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.015
I'm a pickle.
I-I'm just trying

01:55.048 --> 01:56.750
to figure out
why you would do this...

01:56.784 --> 01:58.152
Why anyone would do this.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.754
The reason anyone would
do this is, if they could,

02:00.788 --> 02:02.856
which they can't,
would be because they could,

02:02.890 --> 02:04.358
which they can't.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.093
Morty, we have to get going,
or we're gonna be late.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.828
Where's your grandpa?
Right here, sweetie.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.697
I'm a pickle!
What?!

02:09.729 --> 02:10.964
Why would you... ugh!

02:10.997 --> 02:12.558
Look, we're running late.
We have to go.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.701
Where are you guys going?

02:13.734 --> 02:16.103
We have an appointment downtown

02:16.136 --> 02:19.207
that was set a week ago
and agreed upon by everyone,

02:19.240 --> 02:20.541
including you.

02:20.574 --> 02:23.311
Oh, my God. Beth, oh,
it totally slipped my mind.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.546
Geez, oh, man.
I'm a pickle.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.315
I mean, I don't know
if I can... ooh, geez.

02:27.348 --> 02:30.484
Rick, did you do this on purpose
to get out of family counseling?

02:30.518 --> 02:31.952
- Morty!
- It's okay, Beth.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.387
I understand Morty's suspicion.

02:33.421 --> 02:34.822
I've misled him before.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.958
Morty, turn me so we're
making eye contact.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.395
Morty, I assure you,
I would never find a way

02:41.429 --> 02:43.531
to get out of family therapy.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.366
I hope my lack
of fingers doesn't prevent

02:45.399 --> 02:46.734
the perception of my air quotes.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.569
Can't you just turn yourself
back into a human?

02:48.602 --> 02:49.670
Great question, Summer.

02:49.703 --> 02:50.904
The unfortunate answer is

02:50.938 --> 02:52.673
I did this to challenge myself.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.242
And it could take
hours or even days

02:54.275 --> 02:56.744
before I'm able to figure out
how to return to human form.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.679
But, I mean, you know,
your mom could put me

02:58.712 --> 03:00.281
in a purse or a pocket,
you know,

03:00.314 --> 03:01.415
if she really needs me to go.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.651
Nobody needs anything.
Okay, it's fine.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.085
I mean, you should just
stay here and figure out

03:05.118 --> 03:06.754
how to stop being
a pickle, okay?

03:06.787 --> 03:09.723
Hey, Rick, why is there
a syringe of mysterious fluid

03:09.757 --> 03:11.158
hanging directly over you?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.727
Also, why is the string
attached to it running through

03:13.761 --> 03:15.529
a pair of scissors
attached to a timer?

03:15.563 --> 03:17.731
And why is the time set
to 10 minutes from now,

03:17.765 --> 03:21.101
exactly when we would
have left for therapy?

03:21.134 --> 03:23.371
Well, Morty, if you know
must know,

03:23.404 --> 03:25.839
the syringe is completely
unrelated to this discussion,

03:25.873 --> 03:28.108
and, therefore, it does not
warrant further explanation.

03:28.141 --> 03:30.944
Enough. Kids, it's time to go.
We don't want to be late.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.680
W-w-what are you
doing there, Beth?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.282
What are you doing there,
sweetie?

03:34.315 --> 03:36.083
Well, I mean, you don't
want to get pierced by a needle

03:36.116 --> 03:37.751
full of liquid unrelated
to your situation.

03:37.785 --> 03:38.786
How's that gonna help?

03:38.819 --> 03:39.920
Can't argue with that.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.054
Great.
We'll see you later.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.623
Hey, hey, be careful with that.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.957
It's for something else.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.559
It's really important,

03:45.593 --> 03:47.295
so don't break it.

03:47.328 --> 03:50.097
Okay, I may have fucked up here.

03:51.299 --> 03:54.234
Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut,
dah, pap, pap, pap, pah.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.803
T-t-tah, tah.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.716
Oh, great.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.318
Stupid cat.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.487
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I know what it looks like

04:13.521 --> 04:14.988
to you, Izzy,
but I'm not a snake!

04:15.022 --> 04:16.890
I've seen the YouTube videos,
I know cats are scared

04:16.923 --> 04:18.826
of cucumbers and pickles because
they think they're snakes.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.428
I'm not a snake!

04:20.461 --> 04:21.995
I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!

04:22.029 --> 04:22.896
Whoa!

04:22.930 --> 04:25.265
Oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:26.700 --> 04:30.304
Oh, crap, that sun is bright.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.572
Okay, come on.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.906
This can't really be
the way I go out.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.508
This is the mega-genius
equivalent

04:34.542 --> 04:37.478
of dying on the toilet.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.514
So hot.

04:40.548 --> 04:43.717
This is how I'm gonna die.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.794
Oh, God, moisture.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.597
Oh, God, the moisture...
Dial it back, God.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.466
Dial it back a little bit here!

04:58.499 --> 04:59.767
Oh! Oh.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.538
Oh, God!

05:04.572 --> 05:06.340
Perpendicular, perpendicular!

05:06.374 --> 05:08.208
Oh, shit!

05:08.241 --> 05:10.243
Oh! Oh!

05:18.552 --> 05:20.921
Oh!

05:27.761 --> 05:29.797
Come on.
That's it.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.565
Come get this delicious brine.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.733
Aah!

05:34.768 --> 05:37.070
Come on!
Come on, mother-fucker

05:37.104 --> 05:38.539
Come on!

05:59.292 --> 06:01.194
Yes!

06:01.228 --> 06:03.431
How is this even family therapy

06:03.464 --> 06:06.033
if Dad's not invited
and Grandpa won't come?

06:06.066 --> 06:08.201
Yeah, and what's courageous
about eating a hot dog?

06:08.235 --> 06:10.438
It's nobody's choice
to be here, you knobs.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.173
The family was told to get
counseling by your principal,

06:13.206 --> 06:15.075
even though it's not
the family that was

06:15.108 --> 06:17.277
huffing pottery glaze
in the art room

06:17.310 --> 06:19.246
and desk wetting
in history class.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.348
Oh, the Smith family,

06:21.381 --> 06:22.616
minus a dad.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.284
You're patients
of Dr. Wong, too?

06:24.317 --> 06:26.286
Temporarily...
By order of the school.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.957
Me too. How long have
you all been eating poop?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.560
We... have never...

06:32.593 --> 06:33.594
eaten poop.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.262
Uh, me, neither.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.865
Say, where did my family
get off to?

06:37.898 --> 06:40.468
Smith family,
I'm Dr. Wong.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.836
Come on in.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.809
I was told there was a grandpa
that might be joining us?

06:48.842 --> 06:51.211
He got wrapped up
in an experiment.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.813
He's a scientist.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.082
Like, legit,
like on a an inter-galactic,

06:55.115 --> 06:56.717
sci-fi level.
His work is very...

06:56.750 --> 06:57.990
He turned himself into a pickle.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.621
Morty, Mom's talking.
I'm sorry.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.155
I suppose that's a good segue

07:02.189 --> 07:04.391
into our little
discipline cases here.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.160
Does Grandpa turn himself
into a pickle a lot?

07:07.194 --> 07:10.263
What?! No!
What kind of question is that?

07:10.297 --> 07:13.166
The kind that wasn't designed to
attack or hurt you in any way.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.569
Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these.

07:15.603 --> 07:19.239
No, my father has never turned
himself into a pickle before.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.341
He's unpredictable
and eccentric.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.911
The whole family is.
Speaking of which...

07:23.944 --> 07:26.847
Okay, let's open things up
to the whole family,

07:26.880 --> 07:28.582
and let me ask this.

07:28.616 --> 07:32.185
Why do we think Grandpa
turned himself into a pickle?

07:41.294 --> 07:43.864
Wow. Ugh!

07:46.800 --> 07:48.936
Hey, listen, I know this
is your world not mine.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.871
The sooner I can get out,
the sooner I can go back

07:50.904 --> 07:55.042
to taking big craps, and you can
go back to subsisting on them.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.610
You are one driven rat.

07:56.644 --> 08:00.714
Could you be
a little more driven?

08:00.748 --> 08:03.884
To the right.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.152
Yes, yes, yes!

08:05.185 --> 08:07.521
Come on, come on, come on!
Fresh, fresh, fresh!

08:07.555 --> 08:09.322
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
was this your friend?

08:09.356 --> 08:13.360
Don't worry, he died doing what
he loved, being a dumb
fucking rat.

08:18.431 --> 08:22.435
**

08:34.114 --> 08:35.649
Oh, yeah!

08:59.139 --> 09:00.674
Aaaah!

09:00.708 --> 09:02.442
I didn't say
my father is perfect,

09:02.475 --> 09:03.777
I said his work is important.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.278
And she's saying
what's important is

09:05.312 --> 09:07.681
that Grandpa lied to you
to get out of coming here.

09:07.715 --> 09:08.782
Oh, he did not!

09:08.816 --> 09:10.117
Let's do an experiment here.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.285
I get the impression
this family values science.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.855
So raise your hand
if you feel certain

09:14.888 --> 09:17.257
you know what was
in the syringe.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.193
Raise your hand if
you know for certain

09:20.227 --> 09:23.831
the syringe does not
contain anti-pickle serum.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.767
Beth, your hand did
a little thing there.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.368
Do you really not see
what's happening here?

09:28.401 --> 09:29.937
Tell me.
Well, Dr. Wong...

09:29.970 --> 09:31.404
By the way, racist name...

09:31.438 --> 09:33.807
Obviously, Morty and Summer
are seizing on your

09:33.841 --> 09:36.043
arbitrary pickle obsession
as an end run

09:36.076 --> 09:38.411
around what was supposed
to be their therapy.

09:38.445 --> 09:39.980
Oh, I think this pickle incident

09:40.013 --> 09:41.581
is a better path than any other

09:41.615 --> 09:43.550
to the heart of
your family's dysfunction.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.619
I think it's possible
that you and your father

09:45.653 --> 09:48.121
have a very specific dynamic.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.156
I don't think it's one

09:49.189 --> 09:50.824
that rewards emotion
or vulnerability.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.292
I think it may punish them.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.728
I think it's possible that
dynamic eroded your marriage,

09:54.762 --> 09:56.797
and is infecting
your kids with a tendency

09:56.830 --> 09:59.566
to misdirect their feelings.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.668
Fuck you.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.701
- Mom!
- Mom!

10:01.702 --> 10:03.003
Fuck both of you, too.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.674
By the way, you might
notice that in spite of

10:06.707 --> 10:08.942
your numerous
distinctive features,

10:08.976 --> 10:12.646
I never gave you a name
like Scar or Stripe or Goliath.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.782
That's because, to me,
you aren't special.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.084
You were special to rats.
Now they're dead.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.419
I guess it was me
you should have impressed.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.989
God damn it, I love myself.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.067
Pickle Rick!

10:48.248 --> 10:49.549
Get that parkour.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.218
Get that parkour!

10:54.087 --> 10:55.723
Hey, it's cool.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.990
Just need to find
the nearest exit.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.658
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No need to freak out.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.129
Whoa!

11:03.063 --> 11:05.065
Who in the fuck"s toilet
is this?

11:11.939 --> 11:13.040
What is it?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.408
A pickle? A rat? Both.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.077
It says it's a scientist.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.411
Where is it?

11:18.445 --> 11:20.313
It seems to be
using the air ducts

11:20.347 --> 11:22.082
and the mail tubes
to get around.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.517
It's been gathering
office supplies, we think,

11:24.551 --> 11:25.753
to build weaponry.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.988
But look what it
did on the mezzanine.

11:28.021 --> 11:32.425
It transferred a bottle from
the trash to the recycling bin.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.929
Whatever this thing is,
it's shaming us.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.431
We have 34 armed guards,
and we can't kill a pickle?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.333
32 armed guards.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.202
He killed two.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.703
It's on the phone.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.173
Put him on, and locate
the phone he's using.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.875
Hello.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.710
Rick: Hi, um, can you, uh,
please let me out.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.379
Your mere presence
in this building

11:52.412 --> 11:54.081
violates international law.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.050
I couldn't let you out even
if you hadn't killed two men.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.619
You should know
those men killed themselves.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.088
And how is that?

12:01.121 --> 12:03.090
They didn't let me out.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.124
Solen'ya.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.725
Shut your mouth
and do your jobs,

12:05.759 --> 12:06.927
you fucking children!

12:06.960 --> 12:08.728
Uh, is this not
a good time or...?

12:08.762 --> 12:11.731
Some of my men
are calling you "Solen'ya"...

12:11.765 --> 12:14.768
The Pickle Man,
an old wives tale.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.569
He crawls from
bowls of cold soup

12:16.603 --> 12:18.705
to steal the dreams
of wasteful children.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.240
That'd be a lucky break for you.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.243
Go, shoot to kill.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.113
Aaah!

12:36.589 --> 12:37.624
We got him.

12:37.657 --> 12:38.758
- Ah.
- Ah.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.093
Rick: Because this pickle

12:40.127 --> 12:42.429
doesn't care
about your children.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.931
And I'm not gonna
take their dreams.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.934
I'm gonna take their parents.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.518
Solen'ya!
He's coming!

13:05.552 --> 13:08.288
It's because I threw
half-way my sandwich!

13:08.321 --> 13:10.123
He's just a pickle!

13:10.157 --> 13:11.291
He's a monster.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.994
He's not the only one.

13:21.969 --> 13:25.939
You can stay, dead to the world
and die in this room.

13:25.973 --> 13:30.010
Or you can kill a pickle for me
and earn your freedom.

13:30.043 --> 13:34.347
There is no freedom while
you're leader breathes.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.449
Our country is a prison.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.018
Then Catarina is a prisoner.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.820
Perhaps I could arrange
her escape, as well.

13:40.854 --> 13:44.391
She lives, Jaguar.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.826
Where is this pickle?

13:46.860 --> 13:49.162
What do you think is
in the syringe, Beth?

13:49.196 --> 13:51.698
You're the one that costs
$200 an hour. You tell me.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.233
- Anti-pickle serum.
- It's anti-pickle serum.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.336
Your kids think it might be
anti-pickle serum.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.907
My kids pee their desks
and suck on unbaked vases.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.209
They're just angry at me
for divorcing their father.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.843
I never said I was angry at you.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.046
That's the point of
pottery-enamel huffing, Summer.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.015
You do it so you
don't have to say

14:08.048 --> 14:09.816
"I'm angry at mommy" out loud.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.351
Oh, my God!
Oh, there...

14:11.384 --> 14:13.686
There's pictures of people
eating poop in there!

14:13.720 --> 14:17.224
It's not my job to take
sides or pass judgment.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.993
Do you think when your father
asks for that syringe,

14:20.027 --> 14:22.362
you could ask him...
He won't have to
ask for it, okay?

14:22.395 --> 14:23.395
He won't need it.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.697
He'll just make more.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.366
He doesn't need
anything from anyone.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.736
You admire him for that.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.504
It's better than
making your problems

14:31.538 --> 14:32.772
other people's problems.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.724
Oh, come on!

15:02.169 --> 15:05.272
Pickle Man, you should
know this isn't personal!

15:05.305 --> 15:06.739
You should know
that isn't original.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.075
They have my daughter.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.943
There's nothing I won't do
to see her again.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.579
Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do
to see my daughter,

15:12.612 --> 15:14.147
but killing you gets me
to her quicker

15:14.181 --> 15:16.416
than your derivative bullshit.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.889
I never bullshit, Pickle Man.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.258
This can only end
with one of us dead,

15:25.292 --> 15:26.793
and I have never died.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.595
That will be your
downfall, Jaguar,

15:28.628 --> 15:31.664
not being open
to new experiences.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.311
Is it done?

15:44.344 --> 15:45.945
Jaguar?!

15:45.979 --> 15:48.115
Rick:
Jaguar couldn't make it.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.016
Do it.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.418
Okay, you win, Pickle Man.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.752
I'm unsealing the building.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.988
No, thanks.
I'm coming for you now.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.957
Pickle Man, there's
$100 million worth of bonds

15:57.991 --> 15:59.459
in a safe on level two.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.692
I'll give you the combination.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.395
That money belongs
to the people.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.464
Shut up and call me
a helicopter, you prick!

16:04.497 --> 16:05.965
Do we have a deal?!

16:05.999 --> 16:07.967
Take that money,
give it to Jaguar's daughter

16:08.001 --> 16:09.001
when you set her free.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.303
Or I'll be visiting you.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.971
Jaguar's daughter is dead.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.340
Huh, so you're a liar.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.674
Jaguar was an animal.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.476
You're an intelligent pickle.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.810
We can do business.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.646
I don't think so.
See you soon.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.148
- Is the helicopter here?
- Yes.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.649
And the police are on the way.

16:22.682 --> 16:23.816
What do we tell them?

16:23.850 --> 16:24.984
Ooh!
Aah!

16:25.018 --> 16:27.020
Tell them we were robbed.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.560
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?!

16:33.593 --> 16:36.163
I'm right here!

16:36.196 --> 16:40.033
**

16:49.709 --> 16:52.212
Farewell, Solen'ya.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.417
F-15s are scrambled.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.019
This helicopter will be
shot down in seven minutes.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.888
Well, my daughter
is about five away,

17:01.921 --> 17:03.256
and I've got about
eight to live.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.758
Pickle Man, it's too late
for me to tell my daughter

17:05.791 --> 17:07.160
I love her, but not for you.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.694
Oh, well, uh, she knows.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.497
I mean, we don't really
buy into that kind of crap,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.332
to the extent that love is
an expression

17:12.365 --> 17:15.001
of familiarity over time,
my access to infinite timelines

17:15.034 --> 17:16.536
precludes the necessity
of attachment.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.106
In fact, I even abandoned
one of my infinite daughters

17:19.138 --> 17:20.339
in an alternate version of earth

17:20.373 --> 17:23.109
that was taken over by mutants.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.278
Okay.
Good luck with that.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.747
Wait. Do I have
infinite daughters?

17:27.780 --> 17:30.850
Huh? Uh, no.
No, nope, sorry about that.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.720
Nope, just me.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.555
Yeesh!

17:37.424 --> 17:38.791
I...

17:38.825 --> 17:40.527
am...

17:40.560 --> 17:42.061
afraid...

17:42.095 --> 17:43.563
that my kids will get expelled.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.365
Good.
Summer, you go.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.567
I am mad...

17:47.600 --> 17:49.402
that I can't huff enamel

17:49.436 --> 17:52.572
without people assuming
it's because my family sucks.

17:52.605 --> 17:56.042
I hope to be seen one day

17:56.075 --> 17:57.577
as someone that just
likes getting high.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.878
Good job.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.980
Morty, do you have
an "I" statement?

18:01.013 --> 18:04.251
I am sad...

18:04.284 --> 18:05.485
that I peed.

18:05.518 --> 18:09.156
I'm sad that I peed in class
instead of a toilet.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.325
Look at this family go.
You guys are pros.

18:12.359 --> 18:15.795
What do you guys think about
doing this once a week?

18:17.364 --> 18:19.866
Ugh.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.807
You must be Rick.
Mm-hmm.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.742
I've heard a lot
about you today.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.578
Your family is crazy about you.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.513
Your daughter holds you
in very high regard.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.847
You're a lucky fella.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.641
Yeah, thank you.
Uh, sweetie, you don't still

18:36.649 --> 18:39.286
happen to have that
syringe in your purse?

18:42.389 --> 18:43.790
Dad...

18:43.823 --> 18:48.261
I would like you to tell me
what's in the syringe.

18:48.295 --> 18:52.465
It's a serum that I need to,
uh, to stay alive.

18:52.499 --> 18:55.502
I have had a rough day.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.805
And, uh, I've sustained
a lot of damage.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.874
I'm pretty close to death,
which the serum will prevent.

19:01.908 --> 19:05.278
By changing you from
a pickle to a human.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.313
Yes.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.482
Rick, why did you lie
to your daughter?

19:09.516 --> 19:11.117
So I wouldn't have to come here.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.552
Why didn't you want
to come here?

19:12.585 --> 19:15.288
Because I don't respect therapy,
because I'm a scientist.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.023
Because I invent, transform,
create, and destroy

19:17.056 --> 19:18.691
for a living, and when
I don't like something

19:18.725 --> 19:20.327
about the world, I change it.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.495
And I don't think going to
a rented office in a strip mall

19:22.529 --> 19:24.397
to listen to some
agent of averageness

19:24.431 --> 19:26.132
explain which words
mean which feelings

19:26.165 --> 19:27.667
has ever helped
anyone do anything.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.502
I think it's helped a lot
of people get comfortable

19:29.536 --> 19:31.471
and stop panicking,
which is a state of mind

19:31.504 --> 19:33.340
we value in the animals we eat,

19:33.373 --> 19:35.141
but not something
I want for myself.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.343
I'm not a cow.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.578
I'm a pickle...
When I feel like it.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.180
So... you asked.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.483
Rick, the only
connection between

19:43.516 --> 19:45.718
your unquestionable
intelligence and the sickness

19:45.752 --> 19:48.688
destroying your family
is that everyone in your family,

19:48.721 --> 19:52.158
you included, use intelligence
to justify sickness.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.027
You seem to alternate
between viewing your own mind

19:55.061 --> 19:58.865
as an unstoppable force
and as an inescapable curse.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.333
And I think
it's because the only

20:00.367 --> 20:02.535
truly unapproachable
concept for you

20:02.569 --> 20:05.204
is that it's your mind
within your control.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.241
You chose to come here,
you chose to talk

20:08.275 --> 20:12.078
to belittle my vocation, just as
you chose to become a pickle.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.414
You are the master
of your universe,

20:14.447 --> 20:17.216
and yet you are dripping
with rat blood and feces.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.353
Your enormous mind literally
vegetating by your own hand.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.189
I have no doubt that
you would be bored senseless

20:23.222 --> 20:25.958
by therapy, the same way
I'm bored when I brush my teeth

20:25.992 --> 20:27.226
and wipe my ass.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.128
Because the thing
about repairing,

20:29.161 --> 20:32.699
maintaining, and cleaning is
it's not an adventure.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.101
There's no way to do it
so wrong you might die.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.969
It's just work.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.405
And the bottom line is,

20:38.438 --> 20:41.408
some people are okay going
to work, and some people...

20:41.441 --> 20:43.776
well, some people
would rather die.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.646
Each of us gets to choose.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.249
That's our time.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.951
I'm going to
give you guys my card

20:51.984 --> 20:53.386
and hope to hear from you again.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.987
And if you have any friends
or family that eat poop

20:55.021 --> 20:57.757
and would like to stop,
give them my number.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.061
I, um...

21:02.094 --> 21:04.096
I'm sorry I lied
to get out of the thing.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.565
I... I shouldn't
lie to you.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.766
Oh, it's fine.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.601
I mean, thank you,
and, yeah, you shouldn't.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.403
But I hope you know
that's not what

21:10.437 --> 21:12.104
that session was supposed to be.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.407
Oh, no, I mean, I know
it was Morty peeing his pants

21:14.441 --> 21:16.509
and Summer snorting glue
or whatever...

21:17.944 --> 21:20.513
She huffed enamel, and we never
even talked about it.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.027
Well, there was so much
more at stake.

21:23.316 --> 21:27.286
I mean, that shrink,
what a monologuist.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.422
Are we gonna go back?

21:29.456 --> 21:31.491
Sweetie, could I get...
Get that syringe now?

21:31.524 --> 21:33.993
Oh, my God, yes!
Dad, it's in my purse.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.862
Oh, I'm sorry.
You must be in agony.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.865
Eh.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.104
Jesus.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.708
Jesus Christ.
Therapists, man.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.042
Weird breed.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.978
Man, I missed having hands...

21:52.011 --> 21:54.947
and blood and a stomach.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.115
We should get a drink.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.650
Really?
Like, go somewhere?

21:57.684 --> 22:00.152
Yeah, let's drop the kids off
and go tie one on.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.655
Absolutely.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.557
I... I liked her.

22:04.591 --> 22:07.660
So what are you thinking,
like, Smokey's Tavern?

22:07.694 --> 22:08.694
Maybe Shoney's?

22:08.695 --> 22:10.830
Yeah, either one.
Either one.

22:10.863 --> 22:14.701
**

22:42.929 --> 22:45.197
Rick: You'll never get away
with this, Concerto.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.366
That is where you're mistaken,
Mr. Sanchez.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.203
This shall be my greatest
performance of all time!

22:53.640 --> 22:55.107
This is it, Morty.
We're goners.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.461
We're not getting
out of this one.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.044
After everything
we've been through,

22:58.077 --> 22:59.045
this is how we're gonna die.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.346
Make peace with your god.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.682
Oh, geez, Rick,
I-I-I don't want to die!

23:02.715 --> 23:05.685
And now for the E-splat!

23:07.754 --> 23:09.589
Jaguar!

23:12.925 --> 23:14.794
Who?
Who was that, Rick?

23:14.827 --> 23:17.830
That, Morty, is why
you don't go to therapy.
