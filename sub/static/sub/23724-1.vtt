00:57.142 --> 01:02.897
<i>No return, no return</i>

01:02.981 --> 01:05.567
<i>There is a river</i>

01:05.650 --> 01:11.197
<i>Called the River of No Return</i>

01:12.532 --> 01:16.995
<i>Sometimes it's peaceful</i>

01:17.078 --> 01:23.084
<i>And sometimes wild and free</i>

01:23.835 --> 01:28.381
<i>Love is a traveller</i>

01:28.465 --> 01:34.512
<i>On the River of No Return</i>

01:35.346 --> 01:39.601
<i>Swept on forever</i>

01:39.684 --> 01:45.440
<i>To be lost in the stormy sea</i>

01:45.523 --> 01:48.276
Wailaree!

01:48.359 --> 01:51.070
<i>I can hear the river call</i>

01:51.154 --> 01:53.740
<i>No return, no return</i>

01:53.823 --> 01:59.204
<i>Where the roaring waters fall
Wailaree!</i>

01:59.537 --> 02:02.332
<i>I can hear my lover call</i>

02:02.415 --> 02:03.875
<i>Come to me</i>

02:03.958 --> 02:06.711
<i>No return, no return</i>

02:06.795 --> 02:13.593
<i>I lost my love on the river</i>

02:13.760 --> 02:18.181
<i>And forever my heart will yearn</i>

02:18.264 --> 02:20.016
<i>No return, no return</i>

02:20.099 --> 02:24.729
<i>Gone, gone forever</i>

02:25.063 --> 02:29.442
<i>Down the River of No Return</i>

02:29.526 --> 02:30.777
<i>No return, no return</i>

02:30.902 --> 02:32.902
Wailaree!

02:37.951 --> 02:43.915
<i>She'll never return to me</i>

02:44.123 --> 02:47.585
<i>No return, no return, no return</i>

03:49.314 --> 03:53.318
- Your Bible, padre. Don't lose it now.
- Thank you.

03:53.443 --> 03:56.738
I expected to find a small trading post,

03:56.821 --> 03:59.657
and instead, Sodom and Gomorrah.

04:00.491 --> 04:03.661
All because someone
has found gold in this earth.

04:03.745 --> 04:05.163
You looking for it too, padre?

04:05.246 --> 04:07.957
I came here as a missionary to the Indians.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.793
I think the white man will need me more.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.348
- Good evening, padre.
- Good evening.

04:26.684 --> 04:29.020
Who's in charge of all this?

04:29.145 --> 04:31.189
The padre'd say the devil.

04:31.272 --> 04:34.067
What about this trading post?
The devil got that too?

04:34.192 --> 04:36.319
No, I still got this.

04:37.695 --> 04:40.365
I'm looking for a boy. About nine?

04:41.532 --> 04:44.452
He was to be delivered here
by a man named Martin.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.871
- You seen him?
- They were here.

04:47.956 --> 04:49.666
Were or are?

04:49.749 --> 04:54.212
I understand the man took off for the hills
almost as soon as they pulled in.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.381
What about the boy?

04:56.464 --> 04:59.217
He's probably walking around here, lost.

05:01.302 --> 05:04.347
Well, if he comes in,
would you hold onto him for me?

05:04.430 --> 05:07.308
- What's his name?
- His name is Mark Calder.

05:07.392 --> 05:10.853
- How old did you say?
- Nine.

05:10.937 --> 05:13.064
What's your name?

05:13.147 --> 05:15.233
I'm not lost.

05:48.307 --> 05:51.394
<i>One silver dollar</i>

05:51.477 --> 05:55.023
<i>Bright silver dollar</i>

05:55.106 --> 06:01.654
<i>Changing hands</i>

06:01.738 --> 06:04.699
<i>Endlessly rollin'</i>

06:04.824 --> 06:07.952
<i>Wasted and stolen</i>

06:08.036 --> 06:09.787
<i>Changing hands</i>

06:10.288 --> 06:14.125
<i>Changing hands</i>

06:14.625 --> 06:18.379
<i>Spent for a beer he's drinking</i>

06:18.546 --> 06:22.091
<i>Won by a gambler's lust</i>

06:22.175 --> 06:26.429
<i>Pierced by an outlaw's bullet</i>

06:26.512 --> 06:32.852
<i>And lost in the blood-red dust</i>

06:33.394 --> 06:36.147
<i>One silver dollar</i>

06:36.647 --> 06:39.484
<i>One silver dollar</i>

06:39.567 --> 06:41.402
<i>Changing hands</i>

06:41.736 --> 06:45.907
<i>Changing hands</i>

06:45.990 --> 06:50.536
<i>Love is a shining dollar</i>

06:50.661 --> 06:55.208
<i>Bright as a church bell's chime</i>

06:55.541 --> 06:58.628
<i>Gambled and spent</i>

06:58.711 --> 07:01.756
<i>And wasted</i>

07:01.881 --> 07:09.847
<i>And lost in the dust of time</i>

07:22.902 --> 07:26.030
<i>One silver dollar</i>

07:26.405 --> 07:29.033
<i>One silver dollar</i>

07:30.159 --> 07:32.703
<i>Changing hearts</i>

07:32.870 --> 07:36.124
<i>Changing lives</i>

07:37.625 --> 07:41.796
<i>Changing hands</i>

07:58.896 --> 08:01.440
Take these beers
down the street to the barber.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.234
- You know where it is?
- Yes, sir.

08:03.359 --> 08:05.653
Bring back the money, cash.

08:05.736 --> 08:09.532
And don't spill the beer, boy.
It's liquid gold.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.420
Hey!

08:51.699 --> 08:54.744
Would you like to shoot
at something taller?

08:54.827 --> 08:58.372
- Like what, for instance?
- Like me.

08:58.456 --> 09:00.917
Do you wanna get yourself a gun?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.085
I don't think I need one.

09:26.817 --> 09:30.613
- What's that tag on your coat?
- The man who brought me here put it on.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.782
I'm looking for my dad.

09:33.866 --> 09:36.160
- What's your dad look like?
- I don't know.

09:36.244 --> 09:38.829
I was just a kid last time I saw him.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.501
Would it be all right if he looked like me?

09:44.752 --> 09:46.837
Yes, sir. It would.

09:48.923 --> 09:51.217
I'm your dad.

09:51.342 --> 09:53.719
How do I know that?

09:53.844 --> 09:56.347
The man who brought you here
was named Martin.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.850
I paid him a hundred dollars.
You came from Illinois.

09:59.934 --> 10:02.186
Anybody coulda found that out.

10:10.069 --> 10:12.446
Who's this?

10:12.530 --> 10:14.615
My mother!

10:19.036 --> 10:21.080
All right, son. Let's get outta here.

10:21.205 --> 10:24.292
- I have to say goodbye to Kay.
- Kay? Who's Kay?

10:24.375 --> 10:26.585
She's the lady who sings in the saloon.

10:26.669 --> 10:30.006
- You have to do that?
- Yes, sir. I have to.

10:30.881 --> 10:33.217
All right. We'll do that first.

10:42.893 --> 10:46.897
Kay! I found him! This is him!

10:47.023 --> 10:51.902
You've got your nerve. Leaving this kid
running around a crummy place like this.

10:52.028 --> 10:55.698
- What kind of a father are you, anyway?
- The worst.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.658
Well, it's nice you admit it.

10:57.742 --> 11:02.246
It's nice you helped him out.
I'd like to give you a little money.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.623
No, thanks. I've got a little.

11:05.416 --> 11:07.168
Well, thanks, then.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.295
Come on, boy.

11:10.171 --> 11:12.506
I hope I see you again sometime.

11:13.382 --> 11:17.053
- It's a pleasure meeting a gentleman.
- Thank you.

11:17.136 --> 11:19.889
- Hey, you're forgetting your things.
- Oh!

11:22.099 --> 11:23.392
Thanks again.

11:23.476 --> 11:25.686
- Goodbye, Mark.
- Goodbye, Kay.

11:39.575 --> 11:45.706
<i>I've looked around the country
and I've seen it all</i>

11:45.790 --> 11:50.711
<i>And what I want, I'm ready to name</i>

11:50.795 --> 11:56.133
<i>It's big and strong and handsome
and it's six feet tall</i>

11:56.425 --> 12:00.679
<i>I'm gonna file my claim</i>

12:00.763 --> 12:02.723
<i>I struck a real bonanza</i>

12:02.807 --> 12:05.643
<i>And he's rough and rash</i>

12:05.726 --> 12:10.689
<i>But what he's got I'm ready to tame</i>

12:10.773 --> 12:16.153
<i>He's worth a fancy fortune
but it's not in cash</i>

12:16.320 --> 12:20.449
<i>I'm gonna file my claim</i>

12:21.158 --> 12:22.952
<i>I got the fever</i>

12:23.035 --> 12:25.830
Oh, the fever

12:26.038 --> 12:30.709
<i>But not for gold in the ground</i>

12:31.085 --> 12:35.423
<i>I want the title to something vital</i>

12:35.506 --> 12:40.428
<i>That I can throw my fences around</i>

12:40.511 --> 12:45.349
<i>A gal should never hustle
with a pick and pan</i>

12:45.433 --> 12:50.354
<i>To dig for gold, that isn't her game</i>

12:50.479 --> 12:52.481
<i>I'll find the man who's found it</i>

12:52.565 --> 12:55.901
<i>Then I'll get that man</i>

12:55.985 --> 13:00.698
<i>Who's gonna help me file my claim?</i>

13:00.781 --> 13:05.578
<i>I gotta file my claim</i>

13:08.372 --> 13:09.665
<i>Lookin' for nuggets?</i>

13:12.877 --> 13:14.920
<i>Mmm, mush</i>

13:19.884 --> 13:22.470
A-B-C-D

13:22.553 --> 13:27.725
<i>Who's gonna file me under "love"?</i>

13:27.808 --> 13:33.898
<i>There ain't a man, not a single man</i>

13:34.398 --> 13:39.195
<i>There ain't a man alive
who wouldn't trade his gold</i>

13:39.278 --> 13:43.824
<i>For what it takes to stay in the game</i>

13:43.908 --> 13:48.829
<i>So have your fun and spend it
'fore you get too old</i>

13:49.330 --> 13:53.501
<i>Who's gonna help me file my claim?</i>

13:53.584 --> 13:56.045
<i>Who's gonna help me</i>

13:56.128 --> 13:58.422
<i>Help, help me</i>

13:58.964 --> 14:03.802
<i>Who's gonna help me file my claim</i>

14:03.928 --> 14:05.971
<i>Tonight?</i>

14:13.854 --> 14:16.023
What are you do...

14:20.361 --> 14:23.447
All right. Where were you all day?

14:23.531 --> 14:25.241
There's an old saying, honey,

14:25.324 --> 14:28.035
"Stick to your peanut stand
if you're never selling nothin'."

14:28.118 --> 14:30.454
- Is that your excuse?
- That's it.

14:35.084 --> 14:37.628
Someday I'll take you
out of this crummy grime.

14:37.711 --> 14:38.837
I'm ready.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.131
No more saloons or tent shows for you.

14:41.298 --> 14:42.800
For me,

14:42.883 --> 14:46.595
I'm gonna take you to all the capitals
of all the countries in the world.

14:46.679 --> 14:48.556
What have you been drinking?

14:48.639 --> 14:51.225
Diamonds in your hair,
rubies on your fingers.

14:51.308 --> 14:56.146
- Bells on my toes.
- Pearls. And gowns made for queens.

14:56.272 --> 14:58.816
Except you'll look better in 'em.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.777
How you gonna do it?
With your deck o' cards?

15:01.860 --> 15:03.946
I've just done it.

15:06.156 --> 15:09.159
- You hear what I said? I've just done it.
- Just done what?

15:09.285 --> 15:13.914
I've just won a gold claim,
right in the heart of the richest strike.

15:13.998 --> 15:15.332
Harry! From whom?

15:15.416 --> 15:19.211
What's it matter? All my life,
I've been chiseling in penny-ante games.

15:19.336 --> 15:22.631
This time I got lucky!
This is the big one, honey. This is it!

15:22.715 --> 15:26.927
- Harry, what are you going to do?
- What do you mean, "me"? You and me.

15:27.011 --> 15:31.932
We're going to Council City and file a claim
before anything can happen to it, or us.

15:32.016 --> 15:35.352
- What could happen?
- Who knows? Who cares?

15:35.436 --> 15:38.439
The man could get mad,
say I did something.

15:38.522 --> 15:40.566
Did you?

15:40.649 --> 15:44.278
I told you, honey.
I got lucky, that's all. Just lucky.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.488
Now, look. We gotta get outta here.

15:46.572 --> 15:50.826
I ransacked the town and there isn't
a horse to be had for the crown jewels.

15:50.909 --> 15:55.372
But I got another idea. We can buy a raft
and go to Council City on the river.

15:55.539 --> 15:58.542
- You got any money?
- Well, I have a little.

15:59.251 --> 16:01.837
All right. Come on! Come up with it.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.892
10, 20...

16:18.771 --> 16:20.898
All you want is my money.

16:26.654 --> 16:28.781
IS it?

16:30.074 --> 16:33.160
We'll plant the field and hunt and fish.
How does that sound?

16:33.243 --> 16:35.079
- Just you and me?
- That's all.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.165
- Fine. Sounds fine.
- We'll make out all right.

16:38.248 --> 16:41.752
I'll teach you to fish and trap.
You'll be as good as the best of 'em.

16:41.835 --> 16:45.047
- And teach me to shoot?
- Yeah, and shoot too.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.227
What are they doin'?

16:58.310 --> 17:00.854
They're just comin'
to look around the town.

17:00.938 --> 17:03.941
- They don't like what they see.
- Will they make a war?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.442
No, they're just hunting.

17:05.526 --> 17:07.736
When they make a war,
they paint their faces.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.280
Then you know they're hunting you.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.344
Mark!

17:32.469 --> 17:34.888
Come on, boy. Giddap! Giddap! Hey.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.473
Oh.

17:37.641 --> 17:40.853
You can't just go through
everything in the world, boy.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.856
Sometimes you have to back up
and go around.

17:44.523 --> 17:47.484
- I just had it goin' good.
- You had it goin' very good,

17:47.568 --> 17:51.655
but we don't wanna break our plow
or hurt our horse, now do we?

17:54.533 --> 17:57.995
Come on. We'll go in the house
and have some coffee.

18:11.592 --> 18:15.512
- Why did you name me Mark?
- Simple.

18:15.596 --> 18:19.725
I'm Matthew. Mark follows Matthew.
It's the Bible.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.935
- I follow you.
- Right.

18:22.019 --> 18:26.356
- And that's how you thought of it?
- It wasn't me, it was your mother.

18:29.777 --> 18:32.362
Come on, let's quit dreaming.

18:32.488 --> 18:35.157
When we get our first wheat
and sell it, you got a present due.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.700
What do you want most?

18:36.784 --> 18:39.286
- A rifle for my own.
- You're getting it.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.872
Will we be rich, like the men finding gold?

18:41.955 --> 18:44.958
No, but we'll beat those that don't find any.

18:45.876 --> 18:49.546
I was away from you a long time, Mark.
That's when I thought about it.

18:49.630 --> 18:53.967
I thought if a man doesn't know
what he's doing or where he's going,

18:54.051 --> 18:57.846
the best thing for him to do
is just back up and start all over again.

18:57.971 --> 19:01.433
I thought I'd start
with the ground and work up.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.061
So I sent for you, and this is it.

19:06.730 --> 19:10.317
Never saw a guy with so many questions.
You got any more?

19:12.152 --> 19:14.571
You never told me where you were.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.953
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

19:21.036 --> 19:23.872
Come on out here with me
and I'll show you.

19:26.291 --> 19:30.337
- I can hit anything you can see.
- OK. That tree.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.215
- Now, how could I miss a tree?
- The branch.

19:33.298 --> 19:36.802
- Which one?
- The one on the top to the left.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.388
You got eyes like a grasshopper.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.894
Man, oh, man.

19:45.978 --> 19:49.815
All right. Your turn.
But this time you're gonna fire it.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.984
Check it.

19:54.278 --> 19:57.739
Now, hold it like I told you,
tight up against your shoulder.

19:57.823 --> 20:00.033
Lay your cheek right alongside of it.

20:00.117 --> 20:02.202
- What's important?
- To hit the target.

20:02.286 --> 20:03.662
- When?
- The first shot.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.956
- Why?
- Because I might not get another.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.625
All right. Take your time and aim.

20:09.418 --> 20:12.337
Flex the elbow. Relax!

20:13.422 --> 20:16.550
- What are you aiming at?
- The branch on the right side.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.343
All right...

20:18.468 --> 20:20.512
Wait a minute.

20:21.430 --> 20:23.807
Maybe we better save that bullet.

20:47.331 --> 20:51.960
- What'll we do if they come with paint on?
- We'll fight 'em. We cleared this land.

20:52.044 --> 20:55.505
It's ours, so we're gonna stay on it,
or under it. Come on.

20:55.589 --> 20:58.425
You're not afraid of anything, are you?

20:58.508 --> 20:59.509
Not with you.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.138
Matt, look!

21:09.728 --> 21:13.190
- Can you make 'em out?
- Looks like a couple of men.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.366
Here, go get some rope.

21:25.369 --> 21:27.496
Hold it! Hold it there.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.540
Hold it right there.
Let me get over here.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.596
Get the horse.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.758
Right, go on. Pick him up. Giddap!

22:23.510 --> 22:25.595
Take him over to the right.

22:28.265 --> 22:30.350
More!

22:41.653 --> 22:43.655
Here!

22:43.739 --> 22:45.824
Get ready to get off.

23:02.799 --> 23:03.800
Oh!

23:04.718 --> 23:06.928
- My things!
- Let it go.

23:17.898 --> 23:21.985
- Believe it or not, this is our honeymoon.
- The idea is to live through it.

23:22.069 --> 23:26.740
- Calder's my name. Matt Calder.
- Weston. Harry Weston. I sure thank you.

23:26.823 --> 23:30.202
- Hi!
- It's so good to see you again.

23:30.327 --> 23:33.080
- You two know each other?
- We're old friends.

23:33.163 --> 23:35.290
Come up to the cabin and dry off.

23:35.373 --> 23:37.751
- Son, run along and build up a fire.
- All right.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.003
Come on, I'll go with you.

23:42.798 --> 23:45.217
- Let's go.
- I'm with you. Let's go.

23:47.427 --> 23:51.181
- What is this? What you got here, Calder?
- A farm.

23:51.264 --> 23:54.643
Everybody is lookin' for gold
and you're diggin' a farm?

23:54.726 --> 23:55.852
That's it.

23:55.936 --> 23:59.356
- Maybe you know what you're doing.
- Well, I know that they don't.

23:59.439 --> 24:03.443
- Don't I know you from somewhere?
- That might depend on what you do.

24:03.527 --> 24:07.114
- I'm a gambler.
- Then you don't know me from anywhere.

24:07.197 --> 24:11.535
- I always say "What's the difference?"
- That's what I always say.

24:17.332 --> 24:21.461
- He fixed the sweep on the raft.
- Yeah, he's a man in a hurry.

24:21.545 --> 24:24.965
It's a matter of life and death.
He's gotta get to Council City.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.801
- On that raft?
- He says so.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.470
Well, don't bring his troubles to me.

24:31.221 --> 24:33.473
She's beautiful, isn't she?

24:33.557 --> 24:36.268
There's an old saying, Mark,
"it's only skin-deep."

24:36.393 --> 24:38.520
- What is?
- Beauty.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.191
How deep should it be?

24:43.275 --> 24:46.945
Well, ask her, son. She looks like an expert.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.785
- Hi.
- Hi, friend.

24:56.413 --> 24:57.998
Pretty elegant, aren't they?

24:58.081 --> 25:01.376
Gotta take care of them.
They're all I got left.

25:02.586 --> 25:06.089
- Why did you get married?
- I fell in love.

25:06.214 --> 25:10.302
- How do you know when you fall in love?
- I don't know. Can't eat or sleep.

25:10.427 --> 25:14.890
- Like an ache in the stomach?
- Same thing, only in the heart.

25:14.973 --> 25:18.101
- You'll find out when you get older.
- How old are you?

25:18.185 --> 25:22.314
That's no question to ask a lady!
Not that I'm a lady.

25:22.439 --> 25:24.024
Why aren't you?

25:24.107 --> 25:27.027
See me in about ten years.
I'll try and tell you.

25:27.110 --> 25:30.655
I said you were beautiful,
and he said beauty was skin-deep.

25:30.739 --> 25:34.534
- Who did?
- Matt, my dad. He said it was an old saying.

25:34.618 --> 25:37.412
It's an old saying by an old crow.

25:44.794 --> 25:47.923
- When did you lose your mother?
- It was while Dad was away.

25:48.006 --> 25:50.133
That's why he sent for me.

25:50.217 --> 25:53.345
- Are you going to look for gold?
- I could stand a little.

25:53.428 --> 25:56.640
- What would you do with it?
- Do with it?

25:56.723 --> 26:02.729
Buy fancy gowns, live in the swell hotels
in the big city. Go to the opera.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.398
- What's that?
- That's music.

26:05.482 --> 26:09.277
Very high-toned and fancy.
Not like mine.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.488
I like yours.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.740
Would you sing one?

26:13.823 --> 26:17.244
I might have one for you,
if I can remember it.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.412
It was a long time ago.

26:24.084 --> 26:29.339
<i>When Mr South Wind sighs in the pines</i>

26:29.714 --> 26:36.054
<i>Old Mr Winter whimpers and whines</i>

26:36.137 --> 26:38.306
<i>Down in the meadow</i>

26:38.390 --> 26:40.308
<i>Under the snow</i>

26:40.392 --> 26:45.563
<i>April is teaching green things to grow</i>

26:46.106 --> 26:51.111
<i>When Mr West Wind howls in the glade</i>

26:51.194 --> 26:53.738
<i>Old Mr Summer</i>

26:54.197 --> 26:57.909
<i>Nods in the shade</i>

26:58.034 --> 26:59.786
<i>Down in the meadow</i>

26:59.869 --> 27:01.997
<i>Under the brook</i>

27:02.080 --> 27:05.041
<i>Catfish are waitin' for the hook</i>

27:05.667 --> 27:09.838
<i>Old Lady Blackbird
flirts with the scarecrow</i>

27:09.921 --> 27:13.842
<i>Scarecrow is waving at the moon</i>

27:13.925 --> 27:17.721
<i>Old Mr Moon makes hearts everywhere go</i>

27:17.804 --> 27:19.889
<i>Bump, bump</i>

27:20.390 --> 27:22.350
<i>With the magic of tunes</i>

27:22.434 --> 27:25.061
All right, come and get it.

27:26.021 --> 27:28.523
<i>When Mr East Wind</i>

27:28.732 --> 27:31.234
<i>Shouts overhead</i>

27:31.776 --> 27:34.154
<i>Then all the leaves</i>

27:34.237 --> 27:36.740
<i>Turn yellow and red</i>

27:37.741 --> 27:39.701
<i>Down in the meadow</i>

27:39.784 --> 27:41.870
<i>Corn stocks are high</i>

27:42.037 --> 27:47.959
<i>Pumpkins are ripe and ready for pie</i>

27:49.252 --> 27:52.505
I look at you and I can't see you
becoming a farmer.

27:52.589 --> 27:54.424
Anything else I might believe.

27:54.549 --> 27:57.886
- I'll try and struggle along without you.
- Some more coffee?

27:57.969 --> 28:00.597
What do they do with the gold
after they find it?

28:00.680 --> 28:03.183
- They make money out of it.
- Why do they use gold?

28:03.266 --> 28:04.809
Because it's hard to get.

28:04.893 --> 28:06.978
Why don't they use something easy to get?

28:07.062 --> 28:09.856
If something's easy to get,
people don't care about it.

28:09.939 --> 28:11.399
They don't value it.

28:11.483 --> 28:13.943
If it's hard to get,
then you've got something.

28:14.027 --> 28:16.696
Like a mink? A mink is hard to catch.

28:16.780 --> 28:19.199
Now you've got it. That's the idea exactly.

28:19.282 --> 28:22.452
- How about a skunk?
- How about another dish?

28:22.577 --> 28:27.665
Calder, how long do you think it'll take us
to get from here to Council City?

28:27.791 --> 28:31.294
- You don't know this country.
- No, but I got a map here.

28:34.089 --> 28:36.841
All right. You're right here.

28:37.467 --> 28:40.887
Now you had some trouble getting here,
and some luck too.

28:40.970 --> 28:44.182
- There's Council City down there.
- That's not far.

28:44.265 --> 28:48.311
A good green log might not make those
rapids between here and Council City.

28:48.436 --> 28:51.314
- We made the last one.
- I know. I was there.

28:52.607 --> 28:56.319
The river drops from here.
The rapids get worse.

28:56.403 --> 28:59.781
You cut through a gorge
of solid wall for 15 miles.

28:59.864 --> 29:02.033
The wall goes straight up.

29:02.117 --> 29:06.579
The other way is overland, but you
haven't got a gun, haven't got a horse.

29:06.663 --> 29:08.415
So you say it can't be done.

29:08.498 --> 29:10.959
You asked me how far it was,
that's how far.

29:11.042 --> 29:12.669
That's enough.

29:12.836 --> 29:16.256
Calder, I got a gold claim
to file in Council City.

29:16.339 --> 29:18.258
I gotta get there.

29:18.341 --> 29:22.345
You can't imagine me being a farmer.
I can't imagine you a prospector.

29:22.429 --> 29:24.347
Won it in a stud game.

29:24.514 --> 29:27.600
All my life, I won the little pots
and lost the big ones.

29:27.684 --> 29:30.437
- This time I got lucky.
- Lucky?

29:30.520 --> 29:34.190
With the boob I was playing,
cheatin' would have just gotten in the way

29:34.315 --> 29:37.694
- Then what's your hurry?
- Maybe the man thinks like you do.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.571
That it wasn't just luck

29:39.696 --> 29:44.159
- What can he do about it now?
- Maybe try to get to Council City, too.

29:44.242 --> 29:48.455
Might get there first,
which'd be bad for one of us.

29:48.538 --> 29:50.790
How much do you want
for your horse and gun?

29:50.874 --> 29:54.169
Money? What would I do?
Plow that field with a silver dollar,

29:54.252 --> 29:56.129
then throw it in some lndian's face?

29:56.212 --> 29:58.882
I gotta get there. How much d'you want?

29:58.965 --> 30:02.385
Why don't you wait till I get
that field seeded, and I'll take you?

30:02.510 --> 30:05.847
- I can't wait.
- Well, I can't go.

30:13.313 --> 30:15.398
It isn't there, Calder.

30:17.567 --> 30:19.569
Go on outside.

30:20.403 --> 30:22.739
Go on, you got a kid out there.

30:33.666 --> 30:36.211
Harry, what are you doing?

30:36.294 --> 30:40.215
I'm taking the gun, Calder,
and I'm borrowing the horse.

30:40.298 --> 30:42.342
Get it.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.262
Get it and no one'll get hurt.

30:47.555 --> 30:50.058
Mark, go ahead. Do what he says.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.937
- No.
- Do it.

30:57.190 --> 31:00.193
This'll only take a few days,
then we'll be back.

31:00.276 --> 31:03.029
- Take the boy with you.
- Boy? What for?

31:03.112 --> 31:07.450
The Indians, Weston. You've got the rifle.
Take the boy with it.

31:07.575 --> 31:11.204
I can't do that, Calder. I'm in a hurry.
This can mean a fortune to me.

31:11.287 --> 31:14.415
- It can mean his life.
- Get some food in a bag.

31:14.499 --> 31:16.584
Let the boy get it.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.047
Saddle the horse.

31:22.257 --> 31:25.677
Harry, we don't have to do this.
It's just a few days.

31:26.386 --> 31:29.764
- It doesn't matter that much.
- Yes, it does.

31:29.847 --> 31:33.226
Four or five days might not
make any difference to a farmer

31:33.309 --> 31:34.769
but they do to me.

31:35.478 --> 31:38.606
I'm not stealing anything.
I'm just borrowin' it.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.984
You'll get paid plenty for the faith.

31:41.109 --> 31:45.780
A fistful of money in the hand's as good
as a fistful of wheat in the ground.

31:52.036 --> 31:54.080
Matt! Matt!

32:07.176 --> 32:09.012
Look out, Mark, the gun!

32:16.394 --> 32:18.271
Matt! Matt!

32:19.230 --> 32:23.026
- Come on, let's get outta here.
- You've killed my dad!

32:23.109 --> 32:26.029
- He'll be all right. Get some water.
- Come on!

32:26.112 --> 32:29.449
- We can't leave him like this. He's hurt.
- He didn't have to be.

32:29.532 --> 32:32.535
He didn't have to get us off the raft either.

32:35.121 --> 32:38.875
- I think I'll wait here for you, Harry.
- What do you mean, "wait"?

32:39.000 --> 32:44.047
I mean what I said. I can't leave them
like this. I can't leave the boy.

32:44.130 --> 32:48.343
You'll get to Council City twice
as fast without me, won't you?

32:48.468 --> 32:50.845
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

32:50.928 --> 32:54.515
Then you can have the claim filed
and be back here all the sooner.

32:54.599 --> 32:57.060
You go ahead, Harry. I'll wait here.

32:57.226 --> 32:59.812
You won't take long, will you?

32:59.896 --> 33:02.815
Not with you here. You know that.

33:45.692 --> 33:48.194
Stop worrying. He'll be all right.

33:48.361 --> 33:52.323
It'd take more than the wooden end
of a rifle to kill him.

33:52.407 --> 33:54.701
He's got a head like a boulder.

34:08.297 --> 34:11.551
Hey, wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing?

34:13.469 --> 34:16.556
- Have they gone?
- The man's gone. She's staying.

34:16.639 --> 34:19.350
She didn't wanna leave us.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.436
- Why not?
- Because you were hurt.

34:21.518 --> 34:25.148
- She told him she had to stay...
- He left you here to take care of me?

34:25.231 --> 34:29.527
Look, maybe I don't like what he did
or the way he did it, but he'll be back,

34:29.610 --> 34:32.280
and you'll be taken care of.

34:32.362 --> 34:34.489
That's nice.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.495
Everybody's gonna take care of me.

34:42.165 --> 34:44.208
So are they.

34:48.963 --> 34:53.801
Well, we'll have to get outta here.
We'll take the raft. Come on, son.

34:53.885 --> 34:58.681
- How can we take the raft? You said...
- That doesn't count. We got no choice now.

34:58.765 --> 35:00.767
You better get your junk

35:09.066 --> 35:11.652
- Come on, Kay.
- Let's go.

35:16.199 --> 35:18.201
Just a minute. Hold this.

35:29.045 --> 35:30.713
Mark!

35:32.715 --> 35:34.467
Mark, hurry up!

36:15.258 --> 36:17.343
Matt! Look!

36:29.397 --> 36:32.441
It's all right, son. At least we're not in it.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.278
We'll build it up again.

36:40.324 --> 36:42.410
Wouldn't they have done it anyway?

36:42.493 --> 36:45.663
- Against a rifle?
- Wouldn't they?

36:45.788 --> 36:47.832
Not so easy.

36:57.425 --> 36:59.468
All right, hang on.

38:25.805 --> 38:29.600
If things keep on this way,
I'll be using up a good camisole.

38:29.684 --> 38:33.646
Next time, don't try to be so brave.
When you get hurt, yell.

38:33.729 --> 38:36.899
- It just stung, then I forgot it.
- Listen to him!

38:37.024 --> 38:39.568
Keep still a second while I tie it.

38:39.652 --> 38:42.029
- I don't need this.
- Keep still.

38:43.280 --> 38:47.118
Well, I'm gonna see what I can do
with this in the river.

38:47.243 --> 38:50.830
The country's crawling with Indians
and you're going fishing?

38:50.913 --> 38:52.415
There are lots of ways to die.

38:52.498 --> 38:55.668
Starving to death is not
one of my favorites.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.962
He does that for good luck.

38:58.087 --> 39:00.548
He'll need it to fish that way.

39:01.757 --> 39:05.928
I oughta go out and hunt myself.
There should be some berries around here.

39:06.095 --> 39:08.681
- Where?
- Oh, up along there.

39:09.765 --> 39:12.268
I'll pick them. You stay put.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.945
Now stay put.

39:54.977 --> 39:57.063
What do you think you're doing?

39:57.146 --> 39:59.982
Berries. I'm gathering berries.

40:00.066 --> 40:03.235
Not bad. I didn't think you were the type.

40:03.319 --> 40:06.155
Even my type gets hungry.

40:06.238 --> 40:09.492
- Wanna show me your fish?
- I left him in the river.

40:11.494 --> 40:14.413
Take some. Go on, take some.

40:17.500 --> 40:20.878
- Give some to the boy,
- Glad you reminded me.

40:20.961 --> 40:23.339
I never would have thought of it!

40:30.679 --> 40:34.350
<i>Old Lady Blackbird
flirts with the scarecrow</i>

40:34.433 --> 40:38.354
<i>Scarecrow's wavin' at the moon</i>

40:38.437 --> 40:42.149
<i>Old Mr Moon makes hearts everywhere go</i>

40:42.233 --> 40:44.944
<i>Bump, bump</i>

40:45.027 --> 40:50.574
<i>With the magic of June</i>

40:50.908 --> 40:54.120
<i>When Mr North Wind</i>

40:54.203 --> 40:57.581
<i>Blows on the breeze</i>

40:57.832 --> 41:00.876
<i>Old Father Christmas</i>

41:01.085 --> 41:04.630
<i>Trims over trees</i>

41:04.713 --> 41:07.341
<i>Down in the meadow</i>

41:07.424 --> 41:11.303
<i>Snow softly gleams</i>

41:11.387 --> 41:15.015
<i>Earth goes to sleep</i>

41:15.599 --> 41:23.599
<i>And smiles in her dreams</i>

41:29.363 --> 41:31.615
Kinda small fish, aren't they?

41:32.491 --> 41:37.121
There's an old saying,
"A small fish is better than an empty dish."

41:37.246 --> 41:40.374
Say, you got quite a stock
of those old sayings.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.253
Where did you ever learn a song like that?

41:44.336 --> 41:47.756
I didn't go straight from
the cradle to a gold camp.

41:49.925 --> 41:52.511
Why did you ever go there at all?

41:52.761 --> 41:55.598
I had to live. At least, I thought so.

41:56.056 --> 41:58.267
I had to get money to get out.

42:00.186 --> 42:03.022
When I met Harry,
he wanted the same thing.

42:03.647 --> 42:05.691
Then he won the claim.

42:05.816 --> 42:10.237
It was our big chance.
A chance for both of us to get away.

42:11.530 --> 42:15.242
- Where?
- Out of the lives we were both living.

42:16.619 --> 42:20.456
To someplace where people
live like human beings.

42:20.539 --> 42:23.083
That's in heaven.

42:23.167 --> 42:26.503
We weren't thinking of
going quite that far with it.

42:27.463 --> 42:29.924
Well, you're both on the shortcut.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.637
You're going after him, aren't you?

42:34.803 --> 42:36.764
Yeah, that's it.

42:37.389 --> 42:39.767
But you said no one could
go down the river.

42:39.850 --> 42:42.603
You said it'd be suicide if he tried it.

42:42.853 --> 42:45.898
He's not trying. I am.

42:47.066 --> 42:49.360
There's a difference.

42:49.485 --> 42:52.404
You're not gonna give him
a chance, are you?

42:52.488 --> 42:54.657
Sure, I'll give him a chance.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.825
Same chance he gave me

42:57.785 --> 42:59.662
and him.

43:57.261 --> 44:00.306
Next time you try that,
I'll forget that you're a woman.

44:00.389 --> 44:02.391
I doubt that!

44:05.936 --> 44:09.648
Just take my word for it. Fool.

44:09.732 --> 44:12.860
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I think I do.

44:12.943 --> 44:17.906
Do you know how long we'd last out here
without that raft? Without the rifle?

44:17.990 --> 44:20.242
The whole country alive with Indians?

44:20.326 --> 44:22.703
Just how many kinds of fool are you?

44:22.786 --> 44:24.872
I'm not your kind.

44:24.955 --> 44:27.333
What are you? Weston's kind?

44:27.416 --> 44:31.920
You love that rat so much, you'd risk all
our lives just to keep me from getting him?

44:32.004 --> 44:33.589
You couldn't understand.

44:35.591 --> 44:38.886
I just don't see it.
Treating you the way he did.

44:38.969 --> 44:42.473
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you how he didn't treat me.

44:42.598 --> 44:46.310
He didn't treat me like a tramp.
He treated me like a woman.

44:47.353 --> 44:49.188
So he made a mistake.

44:49.271 --> 44:52.441
If you had lived like he has,
all of his life on crumbs and bones,

44:52.900 --> 44:56.695
maybe you'd do a crazy thing
if you had chance to make a fortune.

44:56.779 --> 44:59.323
Maybe you'd do a foolish thing yourself.

45:00.032 --> 45:02.159
I wouldn't leave a kid to die.

45:02.242 --> 45:04.203
Or a woman,

45:04.328 --> 45:05.996
even if she was a tramp.

45:07.581 --> 45:10.084
I suppose you never made a mistake.

45:10.876 --> 45:13.921
You're too perfect. You never made any.

45:14.129 --> 45:16.799
None that I didn't pay for, like he will.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.552
All right. You know so much about him.

45:20.636 --> 45:22.721
But he knows about you, too.

45:22.805 --> 45:25.015
He knows all about you.

45:25.140 --> 45:27.810
If he made a mistake with you,
at least it wasn't murder.

45:27.976 --> 45:30.646
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

45:30.729 --> 45:34.817
He knew who you were. He knew where
you came from and what you did.

45:34.942 --> 45:37.736
He knew you killed a man
and went to prison for it.

45:37.820 --> 45:41.990
And why you went to prison?
Because you shot him in the back.

45:50.999 --> 45:53.168
Go get the stuff on the raft.

45:54.795 --> 45:56.839
Come here, boy.

46:00.217 --> 46:02.761
I shoulda told you myself.

46:02.845 --> 46:05.514
- You did what she said?
- Yeah.

46:08.225 --> 46:11.228
Look. Look, the man was no good.

46:12.062 --> 46:16.108
He was trying to kill a friend of mine
so I shot him.

46:16.191 --> 46:18.902
They sent me to prison for it.

46:18.986 --> 46:21.905
That's where I was
when I was away from you.

46:23.031 --> 46:26.869
I could have told you much easier
when you were older.

46:27.035 --> 46:32.040
- You shot him in the back?
- Yeah, I shot him in the back or in the front.

46:32.124 --> 46:34.293
What does it matter how you kill a snake?

46:34.376 --> 46:37.212
What does it matter which way he's facing?

46:41.258 --> 46:44.887
We'd better get moving.
You wanna help her with the stuff?

47:43.111 --> 47:47.866
The Indians call it the River of No Return.
From here on, you'll find out why.

48:50.304 --> 48:54.099
One thing about this.
The longer you last, the less you care.

49:01.523 --> 49:03.609
Kay!

49:19.958 --> 49:24.463
You stay out here and keep watch.
If you see or hear anything, whistle.

49:40.937 --> 49:44.608
I can't light a fire here.
They may be around here...

49:44.691 --> 49:47.653
- Indians.
- I know.

49:47.736 --> 49:51.114
They can smell smoke
as far as they can see it.

49:51.239 --> 49:54.242
- I'll be all right.
- Hey, you look fine.

49:54.326 --> 49:56.328
You too.

49:56.411 --> 50:00.248
Now, get out of those clothes
and climb into these blankets.

50:02.501 --> 50:04.586
Here.

50:17.516 --> 50:19.559
I'll wait outside.

50:19.643 --> 50:23.605
Dry yourself with one blanket
and wrap yourself in the other.

50:31.446 --> 50:33.448
- See anything?
- No.

50:39.788 --> 50:43.875
- Is she going to die?
- No, she's a strong girl.

50:43.959 --> 50:46.169
She won't die so easy.

50:46.878 --> 50:49.131
But she's awfully sick, isn't she?

50:49.214 --> 50:52.092
Well, she's cold, exhausted, hungry.

50:55.512 --> 50:59.057
- Will we stay here long?
- No. We're hungry, too.

51:00.642 --> 51:04.771
You better see if you can scrape up
some wood. Maybe some pine nuts.

51:04.855 --> 51:08.024
We'll have to take a chance on the fire.

51:08.150 --> 51:10.193
And be careful.

51:17.284 --> 51:19.369
All right.

51:55.363 --> 51:57.824
It's very fancy for the Northwest.

52:00.035 --> 52:02.078
The Emporium, Kansas City.

52:14.007 --> 52:16.051
Lie down.

52:18.637 --> 52:20.764
Come on! Come on.

53:00.095 --> 53:02.138
All right. Sit up.

53:41.136 --> 53:43.096
I think you'll live.

53:43.305 --> 53:46.600
I'm sorry I opened my big mouth
in front of the boy.

53:48.143 --> 53:51.187
You hurt me and I wanted to hurt you back.

53:51.313 --> 53:53.523
Well, that's the way it works.

54:11.166 --> 54:15.170
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be halfway to Council City by now.

54:15.253 --> 54:19.174
If it wasn't for Weston,
I'd be asleep in the bunk in my cabin.

54:38.944 --> 54:41.112
Can't you get some sleep?

54:41.821 --> 54:44.407
Just so he does. That's what matters.

55:32.247 --> 55:35.834
- I don't know what happened to me there.
- You're just hungry.

55:35.917 --> 55:39.004
Sometimes men have eaten
worms and grubs and roots.

55:39.087 --> 55:41.756
- You read that in a book.
- I ate a worm once,

55:41.840 --> 55:44.092
but I was very young then.

55:44.217 --> 55:47.512
Last week in tent city, I ate a sirloin steak.

55:47.595 --> 55:50.015
I was a lot younger then, myself.

55:51.641 --> 55:54.394
He's asleep now.

55:54.477 --> 55:56.813
We'll let him sleep.

55:56.896 --> 55:59.274
It wouldn't be anything if we had a rifle.

55:59.357 --> 56:02.861
He'd just hunt something and kill it.
He's a fine shot.

56:09.284 --> 56:11.369
Why did he kill a man?

56:13.747 --> 56:15.874
Sometimes you can't help it.

56:15.957 --> 56:18.585
Sometimes it's to save your own life.

56:18.668 --> 56:21.212
He said it was to save his friend's.

56:21.921 --> 56:24.174
That can be the same as your own.

56:24.299 --> 56:26.801
Then why'd they send him to prison?

56:28.970 --> 56:31.056
It's hard to say.

56:32.182 --> 56:34.517
Because he shot him in the back?

56:39.105 --> 56:40.482
Kay!

56:42.859 --> 56:45.487
Look, there's two of them!

56:45.737 --> 56:47.822
Wake him! Wake him up!

56:50.742 --> 56:52.869
Look.

56:57.957 --> 57:00.126
Get the rope.

57:13.306 --> 57:15.391
You got him! You got him!

57:43.753 --> 57:47.215
- Isn't it almost done?
- Almost.

57:47.632 --> 57:50.510
- Now, where did she go?
- Her name's Kay.

57:50.593 --> 57:54.430
- I know.
- You always say "you" or "her" or "she."

57:56.891 --> 58:00.436
- Why do you hate her?
- Now what makes you think I hate her?

58:00.520 --> 58:04.566
- You treat her bad.
- I treat her like what she is to me, nothing.

58:05.483 --> 58:09.404
Then it's only because you hate him.
The man who stole from us.

58:09.487 --> 58:12.657
- Well, don't you?
- No.

58:12.740 --> 58:14.909
After what he did to us?

58:15.034 --> 58:17.203
She said he didn't know any better.

58:17.287 --> 58:19.497
She said that sometimes
you do wrong things

58:19.581 --> 58:21.749
that seem all right when you do them.

58:21.875 --> 58:24.377
Like what?

58:24.460 --> 58:26.629
Like what you did.

58:32.385 --> 58:34.470
Are you going to kill him?

58:35.847 --> 58:37.724
Mark, look.

58:38.308 --> 58:40.310
There's a law.

58:40.393 --> 58:42.437
You can't steal a man's horse.

58:43.396 --> 58:46.357
In this land, that's like stealing his life.

58:46.441 --> 58:49.986
I didn't make the law.
All men make them to live by.

58:51.321 --> 58:55.033
What he did to us might have
taken our lives. Still might.

58:57.202 --> 59:00.914
Now, are you gonna tell me
where she went? Where Kay went?

59:00.997 --> 59:03.791
She's taking a bath in the waterfall.

59:05.835 --> 59:07.921
Finish it.

59:15.345 --> 59:18.473
I'd be alive again
if I hadn't starved to death.

59:19.432 --> 59:21.309
I see you're still alive.

59:21.392 --> 59:25.605
- How was the water?
- Freezing, but I'm becoming hardened.

59:25.688 --> 59:27.815
I guess it's from seeing life in the raw,

59:27.941 --> 59:31.611
and running around with strong,
silent types like you guys.

59:31.694 --> 59:34.906
Yeah. I'll go get the stuff off the raft.

59:34.989 --> 59:37.075
I'll help you.

59:38.076 --> 59:40.828
- See how I've changed?
- How would I know?

59:41.496 --> 59:43.915
You oughta take a dip in the falls yourself.

59:43.998 --> 59:47.418
Might wash some of the starch
out of you, or rust.

59:47.502 --> 59:49.837
- Or whatever it is.
- Or whatever it is.

59:51.714 --> 59:54.509
You're not such a mean person,
in spite of yourself.

59:54.592 --> 59:59.222
Some other time and some other place,
we might have even have gotten along.

59:59.305 --> 01:00:02.016
Now what's all this?
What kind of an act is this?

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.353
I'm a performer. Didn't you know?
Songs and dances.

01:00:05.436 --> 01:00:08.731
- I think I know you pretty well.
- I think I know you, too.

01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:11.109
What am I like?

01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:13.319
Really not so bad.

01:00:13.403 --> 01:00:16.155
Not so tough and grim as you seem.

01:00:16.239 --> 01:00:18.616
I think you do a little acting yourself.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.035
You could be nice if you half-tried.

01:00:22.078 --> 01:00:25.290
You don't have to hate me
just because you hate him.

01:00:25.373 --> 01:00:27.500
I don't hate you.

01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:32.463
You'd do anything to save him,
wouldn't you?

01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:35.341
You'd even be friends.

01:00:36.134 --> 01:00:38.678
I could be that without him.

01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:40.888
Why?

01:00:43.558 --> 01:00:45.601
Why not?

01:00:53.318 --> 01:00:55.403
Leave me alone!

01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:12.378
Let me go!

01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:23.765
Matt!

01:01:59.634 --> 01:02:01.677
He sure wanted that meat.

01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:05.723
- Yeah, we're in a hungry world.
- Ain't we?

01:02:05.807 --> 01:02:08.643
- You all right?
- I think so, but you're not.

01:02:08.726 --> 01:02:11.020
- Take your shirt off.
- Oh, I'll live.

01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:13.898
My name's Benson. This is Dave Colby.

01:02:15.316 --> 01:02:16.567
You're a fine shot.

01:02:16.692 --> 01:02:19.654
I'm as hungry as that cat.
We ain't eaten for two days.

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:22.365
Go ahead and eat.
You earned a piece of it.

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:26.160
We smelled your food.
Had to make sure it wasn't Indians.

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:29.622
We left our horses down by the water.

01:02:29.705 --> 01:02:32.333
You prospectin' for gold?

01:02:32.417 --> 01:02:36.754
Not any more, mister.
We're prospectin' for a man.

01:02:36.838 --> 01:02:39.298
You didn't say who you was.

01:02:39.382 --> 01:02:41.467
Calder.

01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:44.929
- This here your wife?
- No.

01:02:45.012 --> 01:02:47.098
You headed for Council City?

01:02:47.181 --> 01:02:49.600
Yeah, on the river. We got a raft.

01:02:49.684 --> 01:02:53.020
Ain't that kinda foolish,
with all these Indians?

01:02:53.146 --> 01:02:56.023
- It isn't too bright without them.
- Yeah.

01:02:56.149 --> 01:02:58.526
Now I know where I seen you.

01:02:58.693 --> 01:03:01.279
Same place you left your table manners?

01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:05.533
Same place I left a gold claim
to a card shark named Weston.

01:03:06.534 --> 01:03:08.870
Wasn't you and him kinda thick?

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:12.915
I can't quite place you.
But then, all the faces look the same.

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:17.128
I heard you and him
pulled out of there, on a raft.

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:20.339
Do you know something about this?

01:03:20.423 --> 01:03:22.550
Yeah, that's my trouble.

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:26.637
I know a little about everything.

01:03:37.398 --> 01:03:40.818
- What are you doing with this guy?
- I want to get away for a while.

01:03:40.902 --> 01:03:44.405
Fresh air and relaxation.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:47.658
Did you dump Weston?
Or did he dump you?

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:51.245
All right, honey. I'm lookin' for him, too.

01:03:51.329 --> 01:03:55.875
Only you try to make Council City on that
raft and you won't get away for a while.

01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:58.169
You'll get away forever.

01:03:58.252 --> 01:04:02.882
- You come with us, and you got a chance.
- Oh, we'll get there.

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:06.385
You get your belly full of food,
and you're a lover.

01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:10.598
Did you hear what I said, honey?

01:04:10.973 --> 01:04:13.100
She heard ya.

01:04:15.937 --> 01:04:20.441
Well, ain't she got a right to take
her best chance the way she sees it?

01:04:20.525 --> 01:04:23.110
With us, she's got one.

01:04:23.236 --> 01:04:28.115
- You wanna ask me?
- Go ahead, honey. It's your party.

01:04:28.241 --> 01:04:31.953
All right.
I'd rather have no chance, with him.

01:04:32.954 --> 01:04:35.039
You heard her.

01:04:35.122 --> 01:04:39.210
You and your partner did me a favor, Colby.
Now I'll do one for you.

01:04:39.293 --> 01:04:41.379
Just take your meat and get out.

01:05:23.504 --> 01:05:25.548
All right, get up.

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.717
Get up!

01:05:35.016 --> 01:05:37.101
You wanna do what I say?

01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:43.566
Do what he says.

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:47.278
Get your horses
and ride them up to that point.

01:05:47.361 --> 01:05:49.488
Wait for your friend there.

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:52.533
Do it.

01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:56.996
No, leave his rifle. Just take yours.

01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.375
Do it, Sam.

01:06:06.213 --> 01:06:08.382
Thanks for the meat.

01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:10.551
Drop your cartridge belt.

01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:19.393
Get the stuff aboard.

01:06:26.609 --> 01:06:28.736
Take that rifle, son.

01:06:38.037 --> 01:06:40.164
All right, come on.

01:06:46.629 --> 01:06:48.714
What's all this for?

01:06:48.798 --> 01:06:52.009
As soon as he gets to that point,
you can run after him.

01:06:52.093 --> 01:06:55.429
- Are you gonna count?
- I can subtract two men from two horses

01:06:55.554 --> 01:06:59.308
and have two horses left for myself,
if you like it better that way.

01:06:59.392 --> 01:07:02.436
- You got the knife, Calder.
- I got it from you.

01:07:04.605 --> 01:07:06.857
All right. Now you can get out.

01:07:07.942 --> 01:07:12.363
I hope this river don't kill you, Calder.
I hope it leaves you for me.

01:07:15.449 --> 01:07:17.618
Too crowded around here.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:30.399
I'm not asleep.

01:08:30.524 --> 01:08:32.818
Here. Drink this.

01:08:33.903 --> 01:08:35.988
Make you feel better.

01:08:36.906 --> 01:08:38.948
Careful, that's the last of it.

01:08:39.033 --> 01:08:41.493
Is that all it's the last of?

01:08:41.577 --> 01:08:43.662
Drink it.

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:51.045
I'll split it with you.

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:54.965
I get everybody into trouble.

01:08:55.049 --> 01:08:57.134
You mean Colby?

01:08:57.218 --> 01:09:01.095
You couldn't help that.
You'll never be able to help that.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:03.474
Besides, it isn't you. It's the gold.

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:07.520
It made a thief of Weston,
a pig out of Colby and a fool of you.

01:09:08.938 --> 01:09:11.106
One thing about you, though.

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:14.151
You get somebody in trouble,
you get right in it with 'em.

01:09:14.276 --> 01:09:17.321
Only trouble should get you somewhere.

01:09:17.404 --> 01:09:22.408
- It never gets me anything.
- Sure it does. It gets you more of the same.

01:09:22.493 --> 01:09:24.620
Not some people.

01:09:24.745 --> 01:09:26.747
- You mean Weston?
- Yes.

01:09:26.831 --> 01:09:29.667
He's going to get someplace,
no matter what it takes.

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:32.877
- Is that why you married him?
- What do you care?

01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:36.048
You lose your ring?

01:09:37.174 --> 01:09:40.344
You know everything, don't you?
Like the kid says.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.513
It's nothing to me.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.684
No. We're not married.

01:09:46.767 --> 01:09:49.228
We were gonna be married in Council City.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:51.729
We're never gonna get there, are we?

01:09:51.814 --> 01:09:54.233
Like you said, who gets anywhere?

01:09:56.819 --> 01:10:00.114
The boy's asleep. You can tell me now.

01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:03.617
I would have said we'd never get here.

01:10:05.494 --> 01:10:07.580
Finish it.

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:13.294
You're a strange man.

01:10:14.128 --> 01:10:16.505
Sometimes not like a man at all.

01:10:16.589 --> 01:10:19.633
- Like an animal?
- No, I didn't mean that.

01:10:19.717 --> 01:10:22.261
I didn't mean it either, back there.

01:10:25.014 --> 01:10:28.392
You know, you're sort of
on the strange side yourself.

01:10:28.475 --> 01:10:31.812
You'd have been surer
of getting to Council City with Colby.

01:10:31.896 --> 01:10:34.481
Why didn't you go with him?

01:10:34.607 --> 01:10:37.318
You have to ask? A man like that?

01:10:37.818 --> 01:10:40.487
Well, what's a man like Weston?

01:10:40.613 --> 01:10:44.533
How would you know?
How would you know anything about him?

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:47.411
What he wanted all of his life,
or what he's been?

01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:50.539
You only know the one thing he did to you.

01:10:50.664 --> 01:10:53.876
The one crazy thing,
because he was desperate.

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:56.462
- About a hunk of gold.
- About his life!

01:10:57.338 --> 01:11:01.884
You can't even see the difference
between him and that man back there.

01:11:47.429 --> 01:11:49.556
Are they waiting for us?

01:11:50.891 --> 01:11:53.102
The fish have a better chance.

01:11:54.395 --> 01:11:55.854
Or him.

01:12:02.695 --> 01:12:05.114
Why can't they get along without us?

01:12:05.197 --> 01:12:07.533
They just wanna make sure of it.

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:13.080
- Did you see 'em?
- I saw the one with the man's horse.

01:12:13.163 --> 01:12:15.249
- What man?
- Colby.

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:18.836
Those birds.

01:12:18.919 --> 01:12:21.338
- They're buzzards?
- Yeah.

01:12:21.422 --> 01:12:23.424
Look!

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.514
Can they come down?

01:12:30.597 --> 01:12:34.893
As soon as they find the right place.
They'll know where it is.

01:12:39.815 --> 01:12:41.942
Hand me that rifle, son.

01:13:27.654 --> 01:13:29.698
Look out!

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:31.885
Matt! Over there!

01:14:37.724 --> 01:14:39.852
Give me the rifle.

01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:47.776
They're gone!

01:15:37.534 --> 01:15:39.620
Get the rope!

01:18:18.653 --> 01:18:21.365
Well, there it is. That's Council City.

01:18:29.164 --> 01:18:34.044
- What do you want when we get there?
- A cup of coffee. A whole cup for myself.

01:18:34.127 --> 01:18:36.254
You've got it.

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:39.299
What do you want?

01:18:39.383 --> 01:18:42.427
- You're still going after him, aren't you?
- You know that.

01:18:42.511 --> 01:18:45.680
- Nothing I could say would change it.
- Nothing.

01:18:47.599 --> 01:18:51.603
Then I'll want one thing.
Let me find him first and talk to him.

01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:55.816
Let me see him alone and explain.
That isn't much, is it?

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:58.110
It might be all he needs.

01:18:58.193 --> 01:19:00.320
Just a few minutes, a little time.

01:19:07.077 --> 01:19:09.329
All right, Kay. You've got it.

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:37.941
- You never believed we would make it.
- Not very often.

01:19:38.024 --> 01:19:39.443
I knew you would.

01:19:39.526 --> 01:19:43.738
I knew that if a man hated
as much as you did, he could do anything.

01:19:43.864 --> 01:19:45.991
- Or loved as much.
- Loved what?

01:19:46.074 --> 01:19:51.455
Him. It was for him. Not the horse
or a gun or the man who took them.

01:19:51.538 --> 01:19:56.501
That's just how it began.
I guess that must be the best thing there is.

01:19:56.585 --> 01:19:59.713
- What?
- To be loved that much.

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:01.882
Look! Here's our horse!

01:20:06.761 --> 01:20:09.764
- Well, it looks like he's here.
- I was hoping he wasn't.

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:13.185
- I was hoping he'd gone back to your place.
- No chance.

01:20:13.268 --> 01:20:16.229
- But why did he stay here?
- Because he knew I'd never make it.

01:20:16.313 --> 01:20:17.522
Matt Calder!

01:20:17.606 --> 01:20:19.900
I thought you was down there
on your farm

01:20:19.983 --> 01:20:21.860
with a tomahawk in your head.

01:20:21.943 --> 01:20:25.572
No, I like to keep my head.
It's about the only thing I've got left.

01:20:25.697 --> 01:20:27.949
That's a fine animal. Who belongs to it?

01:20:28.033 --> 01:20:30.118
Fella named Weston.

01:20:30.202 --> 01:20:33.538
- Where can I find him?
- Across the street at the Black Nugget.

01:20:33.622 --> 01:20:37.125
Say, you look like
you could stand a shot yourself.

01:20:37.209 --> 01:20:39.544
No, but we could use some coffee.
You got any?

01:20:39.628 --> 01:20:42.797
Got everything but paté de foie gras.
Come on in.

01:20:45.926 --> 01:20:48.970
- He's at the Black Nugget.
- Yes.

01:20:49.095 --> 01:20:52.015
- Don't be too long.
- No.

01:20:52.098 --> 01:20:55.644
Tell him I'm here.
He can run but he can't hide.

01:20:55.769 --> 01:21:00.357
He won't run. Just talk to him.
Give yourself a chance to find out.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.567
I'm giving you the chance.

01:21:06.279 --> 01:21:08.782
Where's she going?

01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:11.952
She'll be back.
Come on. Let's get that coffee.

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.731
Kay! Honey!

01:21:41.815 --> 01:21:44.442
Why didn't you start back, Harry?

01:21:44.526 --> 01:21:47.571
I thought I was doing pretty good
just to make it to here.

01:21:47.654 --> 01:21:49.739
Have a seat.

01:21:51.032 --> 01:21:53.743
How'd you get here?

01:21:53.827 --> 01:21:56.162
- Calder?
- Yes.

01:21:56.329 --> 01:21:59.833
- All right. Where is he?
- He's at the store having coffee.

01:21:59.916 --> 01:22:02.836
- He's waiting.
- For me?

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:05.005
For us.

01:22:06.089 --> 01:22:08.300
He let me see you alone first.

01:22:08.383 --> 01:22:10.635
First? Before what?

01:22:10.719 --> 01:22:13.096
You oughta know by now.

01:22:13.179 --> 01:22:15.682
- Would you like something?
- No.

01:22:15.765 --> 01:22:17.892
Nothing, Jack.

01:22:17.976 --> 01:22:20.395
Well, what's there to talk about?

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.772
He could have you hanged for what you did.

01:22:22.856 --> 01:22:25.400
He could kill you
and nobody would blame him.

01:22:25.525 --> 01:22:26.901
I might.

01:22:26.985 --> 01:22:31.781
I told him why you did it, what it was
that made both of us the way we were.

01:22:32.782 --> 01:22:35.118
I think he believed me at last.

01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:38.288
Now it's up to you.
You have to tell him, too.

01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:41.916
- Tell him what?
- The truth, Harry.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.212
That you were desperate. That you
didn't mean to harm him or the boy.

01:22:46.338 --> 01:22:49.591
What makes you think he'll listen to me?

01:22:49.716 --> 01:22:53.511
Because of the kind of man he is,
and because of the boy.

01:22:54.554 --> 01:22:56.598
Or because of you?

01:22:58.099 --> 01:23:00.477
Look, honey. I got the claim filed.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.480
We can get rich and get outta here forever.

01:23:04.773 --> 01:23:09.653
Unless you were thinking you two could
hang me and have the claim together?

01:23:11.655 --> 01:23:13.740
I didn't mean that, honey.

01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:19.162
I mean that all my life I've been nothing.

01:23:19.287 --> 01:23:22.082
A drifter, a cheater, a tinhorn.

01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:26.753
All my life, I waited for the one
big chance a man gets, and this is mine

01:23:26.878 --> 01:23:31.091
I'm not gonna lose it or risk it
or go back to being what I was before,

01:23:31.174 --> 01:23:34.761
or get strung up just because
some dirt farmer wants his horse back.

01:23:34.886 --> 01:23:36.471
That's what I mean.

01:23:36.554 --> 01:23:38.932
All right, Kay, I'll talk to him.

01:23:40.475 --> 01:23:43.645
- What's that for?
- In case he's hard of hearing.

01:23:48.274 --> 01:23:52.070
All right, Kay. Any way you want it.

01:23:52.779 --> 01:23:55.156
Too bad about your place, Matt.

01:23:55.281 --> 01:23:59.452
Bad for me, good for you, Ben.
It all depends on whose ox gets gold.

01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:04.708
- What'll you need?
- Just about everything my credit'll stand.

01:24:04.791 --> 01:24:07.377
- Take what you want.
- Thanks.

01:24:09.379 --> 01:24:12.298
They're all kinda crazy, ain't they?

01:24:12.382 --> 01:24:14.884
- What's that, Ben?
- The times.

01:24:14.968 --> 01:24:18.513
White man chasing gold.
Indians chasing white men.

01:24:18.596 --> 01:24:20.682
Army chasing the Indians.

01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:28.857
If you like that rifle, keep it.

01:24:41.327 --> 01:24:43.455
What are you chasing, Matt?

01:24:45.415 --> 01:24:49.544
Don't try to buy him, Harry. Don't offer
him anything. Just tell him the truth.

01:24:49.627 --> 01:24:51.921
Are you listening to me, Harry?

01:24:56.342 --> 01:24:58.386
- "Harry, no!"
- Honey!

01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:44.098
I... I... I had to!

01:25:45.225 --> 01:25:48.061
It's all right, Mark. It's all right.

01:25:49.312 --> 01:25:52.106
You saw it! You know.

01:25:52.232 --> 01:25:55.693
There was no other way, Mark.
It was him or your dad.

01:26:47.871 --> 01:26:51.249
- Where's she going?
- I don't know.

01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:53.960
- Is she going away now?
- I don't know.

01:27:18.985 --> 01:27:24.282
<i>If you listen, you can hear it call</i>

01:27:24.574 --> 01:27:28.119
Wailaree

01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:35.835
<i>There is a river</i>

01:27:35.919 --> 01:27:41.883
<i>Called the River of No Return</i>

01:27:42.967 --> 01:27:47.138
<i>Sometimes it's peaceful</i>

01:27:47.513 --> 01:27:53.686
<i>And sometimes wild and free</i>

01:27:54.187 --> 01:27:59.025
<i>Love is a traveler</i>

01:27:59.317 --> 01:28:04.530
<i>On the River of No Return</i>

01:28:05.949 --> 01:28:09.661
<i>Swept on forever</i>

01:28:09.869 --> 01:28:15.500
<i>To be lost in the stormy sea</i>

01:28:15.583 --> 01:28:18.670
Wailaree

01:28:18.753 --> 01:28:21.214
<i>I can hear the river call</i>

01:28:21.339 --> 01:28:24.050
<i>No return, no return</i>

01:28:24.467 --> 01:28:27.053
<i>No return, no return</i>

01:28:27.136 --> 01:28:30.098

01:28:30.181 --> 01:28:33.059
<i>I can hear my lover call</i>

01:28:33.142 --> 01:28:34.811
<i>Come to me</i>

01:28:34.894 --> 01:28:37.814
<i>No return, no return</i>

01:28:38.106 --> 01:28:44.779
<i>I lost my love on the river</i>

01:28:44.988 --> 01:28:50.743
<i>And forever my heart will yearn</i>

01:28:51.369 --> 01:28:56.165
<i>Gone, gone forever</i>

01:28:56.249 --> 01:29:02.296
<i>Down the River of No Return</i>

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:04.424
Wailaree

01:29:05.133 --> 01:29:10.930
Wailaree

01:29:12.849 --> 01:29:19.022
<i>He'll never return to me</i>

01:29:19.105 --> 01:29:21.607
<i>No return, no return, no return</i>

01:29:21.733 --> 01:29:23.776
<i>Never</i>

01:29:50.887 --> 01:29:52.513
Hey, what's going on here?

01:29:54.307 --> 01:29:56.601
Are you crazy, Matt? Put me down.

01:29:57.477 --> 01:29:59.562
Matt!

01:30:05.985 --> 01:30:08.362
- Where are you taking me?
- Home.

01:30:08.488 --> 01:30:12.617
