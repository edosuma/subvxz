PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:09.142 --> 00:11.978
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:12.012 --> 00:13.980
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:15.348
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:15.383 --> 00:18.085
<i>in Africa, Europe and</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:18.119 --> 00:20.788
PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not
stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:20.822 --> 00:22.389
REAGAN: <i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.424 --> 00:24.091
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:24.125 --> 00:25.692
REPORTER:
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:25.727 --> 00:26.860
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:26.895 --> 00:28.829
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.863 --> 00:31.231
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.700
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:33.734 --> 00:34.834
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:34.869 --> 00:37.339

MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:45.182 --> 00:47.384
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:47.418 --> 00:51.154
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

SAUL:
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

Fuck!

CARRIE: <i>I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

01:04.200 --> 01:07.035
<i>I won't...</i>

01:08.238 --> 01:10.572

<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:26.624 --> 01:27.623
I got your text.

01:27.658 --> 01:29.159
The CIA-- they're very close

01:29.193 --> 01:31.194
to finding out
about our friend in Gettysburg.

01:31.229 --> 01:33.897
BRODY: <i>- The tailor?</i>
<i>- You need to go there now...</i>

01:33.931 --> 01:35.065
and move into a safe house.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.434
I am giving a speech

01:36.468 --> 01:38.369
at a dinner
for wounded veterans tonight.

01:38.404 --> 01:41.006
If you go there now,
you'll make it back easily.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.008
You think, if they caught me,
that I would talk?

01:43.042 --> 01:44.743
They're not gonna catch you now.

01:44.778 --> 01:45.911
CARRIE:
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:45.946 --> 01:47.046
Am I late?

01:47.080 --> 01:48.214
Carrie, you can't be in here.

01:48.248 --> 01:49.215
What's going on, David?

01:49.249 --> 01:50.282
You're doing
the debrief without me?

01:50.317 --> 01:51.717
Carrie, you didn't
come here today

01:51.752 --> 01:53.653
expecting to
get reinstated, right?

01:53.687 --> 01:56.322
He's still out there, David.
We let him get away.

01:56.356 --> 01:58.191
We need to be doing
everything possible to...

01:58.225 --> 02:01.161
That's not your concern anymore.

02:10.305 --> 02:11.639
(shouts, screams)

02:14.643 --> 02:15.977
Where are you?
I've been trying to call you.

02:16.012 --> 02:16.978
You're late.

02:17.013 --> 02:18.113
(muffled groaning)

02:18.147 --> 02:19.548
(groaning over phone)

02:19.582 --> 02:20.816
Brody...

02:20.850 --> 02:22.885
Hush.
(groaning)

02:22.919 --> 02:24.587
BRODY:
Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.

02:24.621 --> 02:26.455
- What was that?
- What was what?

02:26.490 --> 02:28.090
- Come on!
(over phone): - Brody...

02:28.124 --> 02:30.826
you're breaking up.

02:30.861 --> 02:32.528
(crack, snap)

02:32.562 --> 02:33.963
(over phone):
Brody...

02:33.997 --> 02:35.732
Brody, Brody.

02:35.766 --> 02:38.234
Where the hell have you been?

02:38.269 --> 02:39.669
Either you tell me
what is going on...

02:39.704 --> 02:41.104
- There's nothing going on.
- Or I suggest

02:41.138 --> 02:43.473
you give this marriage
some serious thought.

02:45.143 --> 02:46.343
That's the one piece of intel

02:46.378 --> 02:47.611
you recovered in Beirut

02:47.646 --> 02:49.247
that Estes and his
mob haven't seen yet.

02:49.281 --> 02:51.015
You deserve to see it first.

02:52.885 --> 02:54.652
My name is Nicholas Brody.

02:54.687 --> 02:57.856
People will say that I was
turned into a terrorist.

02:57.890 --> 02:59.024
My action this day...

02:59.058 --> 03:00.425
I was right.

03:00.459 --> 03:03.362
You were right.

03:03.396 --> 03:05.130
(sobs quietly)

03:29.721 --> 03:32.857
(imitating Darth Vader):
I am your father.

03:32.891 --> 03:35.226
Don't make me destroy you.

03:35.260 --> 03:37.061
Is your dad here?

03:37.095 --> 03:38.596
Kenny! Kenny!

03:42.434 --> 03:45.570
Uh, he's, uh...
visiting for the week.

03:45.604 --> 03:47.839
Kenny, this is Saul.

03:51.977 --> 03:53.478
I like him.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.481
Something going on?

03:56.515 --> 03:57.815
Yeah.

03:57.850 --> 03:59.684
Iran?

03:59.718 --> 04:01.052
It's related.

04:01.087 --> 04:03.488
Well, come on in.

04:11.498 --> 04:13.932
So...?

04:13.967 --> 04:16.601
Suicide bomber almost blew up
Vice President Walden.

04:16.636 --> 04:17.937
Jesus! When?

04:17.971 --> 04:19.338
When Elizabeth Gaines was shot.

04:19.372 --> 04:21.607
Remember him in the bunker
with all his cronies?

04:21.641 --> 04:23.843
Remember?
I <i>was</i> one of the cronies.

04:23.877 --> 04:25.511
Someone had on a suicide vest.

04:27.047 --> 04:28.682
He made a tape.

04:49.304 --> 04:51.238
My name is Nicholas Brody...

04:51.273 --> 04:54.976
and I'm a sergeant in the
United States Marine Corps.

04:55.010 --> 04:59.381
I have a wife and two kids
who I love.

04:59.415 --> 05:01.550
By the time
you've watched this,

05:01.584 --> 05:04.253
you'll have read
a lot of things about me,

05:04.287 --> 05:06.556
about what I've done.

05:06.590 --> 05:08.825
That's why I wanted
to explain myself,

05:08.859 --> 05:11.061
so that you'll know the truth.

05:15.466 --> 05:16.933
Why didn't Brody
go through with it?

05:16.968 --> 05:19.569
That I don't know.

05:19.603 --> 05:22.105
So what's our move?

05:22.140 --> 05:24.741
Well, we could arrest him;
that would be that.

05:24.776 --> 05:26.743
Or...?

05:26.778 --> 05:29.613
Or we could leave him
right where he is.

05:29.647 --> 05:30.915
What does that get us?

05:34.519 --> 05:36.387
Iran is planning blowback
against the U.S.

05:36.421 --> 05:38.055
for the Israel bombings.

05:38.089 --> 05:39.490
They've said so publicly.

05:39.524 --> 05:40.824
Right.

05:40.859 --> 05:42.259
Nazir was the agent
of that plan.

05:42.294 --> 05:43.828
That's what the Beirut
meet was about.

05:43.862 --> 05:45.897
And you think Brody's
gonna be a part of it?

05:45.931 --> 05:47.498
Well, he was last time.

05:47.533 --> 05:49.367
He certainly sounds devoted
to Nazir on that tape.

05:52.004 --> 05:53.738
Yes, he does.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.009
So you want to follow Brody.

05:58.043 --> 06:00.511
See if we can get a lead
on what they're up to.

06:00.546 --> 06:02.013
When, where,
what kind of attack.

06:02.047 --> 06:05.149
(sighs heavily)

06:05.183 --> 06:07.084
How do I tell Walden?

06:07.119 --> 06:08.419
You don't.

06:08.454 --> 06:11.055
Saul, the guy's palling around
with a jihadist.

06:11.089 --> 06:12.323
We need him to keep it up.

06:12.357 --> 06:13.924
Nothing changes.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.058
(scoffs)

06:15.093 --> 06:16.293
You know I can't do that.

06:16.327 --> 06:18.128
Nothing changes.

06:18.162 --> 06:20.263
If Walden suddenly dumps Brody,

06:20.297 --> 06:22.932
the other side knows
something's up.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.368
I dupe this guy, he fires
me in five seconds.

06:25.402 --> 06:28.738
You tell him golden boy
plotted his demise

06:28.772 --> 06:30.006
and you missed it,

06:30.040 --> 06:31.574
fires you in three.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.346
(sighs heavily)

06:37.381 --> 06:38.514
I'm cooked either way.

06:38.549 --> 06:40.083
(chuckling) I'm done.

06:42.753 --> 06:44.654
Not if you thwart
an attack on America.

06:44.688 --> 06:47.123
Then you're a hero.

06:50.995 --> 06:52.195
(sighs)

06:55.733 --> 06:58.401
So?

06:58.436 --> 06:59.903
What do you want to do?

07:02.206 --> 07:05.875
Oh, some off-campus space...

07:05.910 --> 07:08.745
surveillance equipment,
a few good men.

07:08.779 --> 07:10.313
Outsiders?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.248
And complete secrecy.

07:12.282 --> 07:15.318
No one in the Agency knows
shit but you and me.

07:15.353 --> 07:18.255
And Carrie.

07:18.289 --> 07:20.090
And Carrie.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.859
Okay.

07:21.893 --> 07:23.727
But I'm sending you a guy.

07:23.762 --> 07:24.728
He'll run it.

07:24.762 --> 07:26.297
Why?

07:26.331 --> 07:28.032
Because I'm sending you a guy.

07:29.435 --> 07:30.602
Fine.

07:33.172 --> 07:35.240
Jesus.

07:35.275 --> 07:36.942
She called this.

07:39.446 --> 07:40.846
Yeah.

07:47.821 --> 07:50.056
Espresso and an apology?

07:52.192 --> 07:54.294
I'll take the coffee.

08:02.136 --> 08:04.070
(sighs)

08:04.105 --> 08:08.141
Yeah... I don't know what else
to say but I'm sorry, Jess.

08:12.881 --> 08:14.581
You can explain.

08:18.353 --> 08:21.889
You can tell me what's going on
and how it's gonna change.

08:27.095 --> 08:29.297
Can you trust me on this?

08:29.331 --> 08:32.832
I want to tell you,
but I can't.

08:32.866 --> 08:34.801
No.

08:36.938 --> 08:38.905
I don't trust you anymore.

08:40.441 --> 08:41.640
That's harsh.

08:41.676 --> 08:43.643
It's true.

08:43.677 --> 08:45.412
I'll do better.

08:47.648 --> 08:50.049
(sets cup down)

08:50.084 --> 08:52.184
It's pretty simple, Brody.

08:52.219 --> 08:54.353
I can't live like this.

08:58.125 --> 09:00.093
I won't.

09:02.830 --> 09:05.764
So if you don't have
something real

09:05.798 --> 09:08.166
to say to me right now,

09:08.200 --> 09:10.268
something true...

09:12.771 --> 09:14.272
...you should pack a bag.

09:36.862 --> 09:38.829
(opens drawer)

09:41.366 --> 09:43.901
So your dad's
in the woodshed, huh?

09:43.935 --> 09:48.339
200 people are waiting
for you, and you go AWOL.

09:48.373 --> 09:51.042
Yeah, you get the shed.

09:51.076 --> 09:52.810
Where do you think he was?

09:54.947 --> 09:56.281
I have no idea.

10:00.620 --> 10:02.287
You want to get stoned?

10:03.823 --> 10:06.091
That can't be the only
thing to do.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.626
What do you mean by that?

10:09.562 --> 10:12.431
I don't know, Xander, I...
it just...

10:12.465 --> 10:13.832
CHRIS:
Dana!

10:13.866 --> 10:15.201
It wouldn't help.

10:15.235 --> 10:17.169
Dad's ready to go.

10:17.204 --> 10:18.237
Hey, Xander.

10:18.272 --> 10:19.639
Hey, dude.

10:29.651 --> 10:31.452
I'll see you later, I guess.

10:44.064 --> 10:46.032
♪ ♪

11:05.587 --> 11:07.455
Well, that's a good sign.

11:07.489 --> 11:09.557
Your mom wants some time alone.

11:09.591 --> 11:11.492
Yeah, I can't blame her.

11:11.527 --> 11:13.761
I mean, you embarrassed her.

11:13.795 --> 11:16.130
- Bad.
- I didn't mean to.

11:16.164 --> 11:17.931
(scoffs)

11:23.171 --> 11:25.806
By the way, your car
smells like smoke.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.542
(sniffing)

11:28.576 --> 11:30.177
I gave someone a ride.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.945
Yeah.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.383
(sniffing)

11:36.417 --> 11:37.984
(quietly):
Oh, God.

11:38.019 --> 11:40.954
Quick-- who wrote the
Declaration of Independence?

11:40.988 --> 11:42.923
Thomas Jefferson.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.024
Correct.

11:44.059 --> 11:45.392
And for extra credit,

11:45.427 --> 11:47.962
how many kids did he have
with Sally Hemings?

11:50.698 --> 11:51.832
What's your problem?

11:51.866 --> 11:54.534
My dad's a liar;
my mom's a rube.

11:54.569 --> 11:56.570
Ah.

11:56.604 --> 11:59.272
Knew we had stuff in common.

11:59.307 --> 12:01.675
(both laugh)

12:11.051 --> 12:12.385
VIRGIL:
Well, well, well...

12:12.419 --> 12:14.687
Carrie Mathison was right
about the red-headed menace.

12:14.721 --> 12:17.923
It only took a year for
people to believe me.

12:17.958 --> 12:20.393
I believed you,
right from the start.

12:20.427 --> 12:22.094
Thank you, Max.

12:22.129 --> 12:23.930
Course, no one ever asked me.

12:23.964 --> 12:26.966
All right, let's do this thing.

12:31.238 --> 12:32.705
Sweet hardware.

12:32.740 --> 12:36.042
Yep, CIA has the best shit.

12:36.076 --> 12:37.677
So, who are these guys?

12:37.711 --> 12:41.147
Um, the same guys who've already
watched Brody for 300 hours.

12:41.181 --> 12:43.248
- Who are you?
- The guy running things.

12:43.282 --> 12:45.584
Is that right?

12:45.618 --> 12:47.419
Yes, it is.

12:47.453 --> 12:48.887
And I don't like surprises.

12:48.921 --> 12:50.522
Well, I'm not crazy

12:50.557 --> 12:51.590
about them, either.

12:51.624 --> 12:53.692
Crazy? Interesting word.

12:55.094 --> 12:56.327
Peter Quinn.

12:56.362 --> 12:57.896
- Uh, Carrie.
- Mathison.

12:57.930 --> 12:59.330
Yes, I know.

12:59.365 --> 13:00.698
I like your work.

13:02.735 --> 13:05.103
Uh, Peter Quinn from where?

13:05.138 --> 13:06.371
Same place as you.

13:06.406 --> 13:08.206
- Officer?
- Analyst.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.540
Estes brought him in.

13:09.575 --> 13:11.709
- Ah.
- So, let's talk shop.

13:11.744 --> 13:13.344
How many years?

13:13.378 --> 13:15.779
Six at Langley,

13:15.813 --> 13:17.214
four on the Venezuela desk.

13:17.248 --> 13:18.382
The cartels?

13:18.416 --> 13:19.616
Like that.

13:19.651 --> 13:21.518
Are we done with
the meet and greet?

13:21.552 --> 13:23.520
SAUL:
Yes. Moving on.

13:23.554 --> 13:25.889
PETER:
So, we run a small team

13:25.924 --> 13:27.157
on Brody 24-seven.

13:27.192 --> 13:28.859
My team already hooked
into the security cameras

13:28.894 --> 13:30.027
in the Rayburn building.

13:30.062 --> 13:31.396
Tapping his home phone and cell.

13:31.430 --> 13:33.231
Anywhere else he goes,
we have a man on him.

13:33.265 --> 13:34.532
And what team is that?

13:34.567 --> 13:35.633
You'll never see them.

13:35.668 --> 13:37.068
Saul and I already have a plan.

13:37.103 --> 13:38.369
Hold that thought.

13:38.404 --> 13:40.271
Brody has a meeting
this morning at the CIA,

13:40.306 --> 13:41.906
and we want to
throw him a jolt.

13:41.941 --> 13:44.308
So we figure go for
his Achilles heel,

13:44.343 --> 13:46.310
which is you.

13:46.345 --> 13:48.946
So I'm in the building.

13:48.981 --> 13:51.115
I... I run into him?

13:51.150 --> 13:52.950
Let it drop you're
back at the CIA.

13:52.985 --> 13:54.251
That should trigger his fear

13:54.286 --> 13:56.253
that your theory about
him is now back in play.

13:56.288 --> 13:57.888
And that should send
him to his handlers,

13:57.922 --> 13:59.055
where you guys

13:59.090 --> 14:00.790
will be there with cameras.

14:00.824 --> 14:02.125
Roger that.

14:02.159 --> 14:03.927
Yeah, okay.

14:03.961 --> 14:06.229
So, you want to tell
us your plan now?

14:06.264 --> 14:08.932
Uh, actually, it was the same.

14:08.967 --> 14:10.167
The same plan?

14:10.201 --> 14:11.836
Same plan, so...

14:11.870 --> 14:14.371
So, I'm only half a moron.

14:21.779 --> 14:23.247
Yeah, definitely.

14:23.281 --> 14:25.316
Definitely gonna need
a supreme detail.

14:25.350 --> 14:27.384
The important thing
is the smell.

14:27.418 --> 14:28.685
Lot of blood splatter.

14:28.720 --> 14:29.886
What?

14:29.921 --> 14:31.021
Bug splatter.

14:31.055 --> 14:32.789
You've been driving
on the highway.

14:32.824 --> 14:34.291
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:34.325 --> 14:35.925
Look, it smells
like smoke inside.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.093
That's got to go away.

14:37.128 --> 14:38.161
That's no problem.

14:38.195 --> 14:39.362
Just choose a scent.

14:39.396 --> 14:42.431
- How long will it take?
- We have pine, vanilla,

14:42.466 --> 14:44.100
- red cinnamon.
- I'm sorry; I'm in a rush.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.868
New car smell?

14:45.902 --> 14:48.036
So how long were we talking?

14:48.071 --> 14:50.338
Well, with the steam
clean, degrease, wax,

14:50.372 --> 14:51.639
it's gonna take a few hours.

14:51.674 --> 14:53.641
(sighs)

14:53.676 --> 14:55.343
Fine.

14:55.377 --> 14:56.944
Can you call me a cab?

14:56.979 --> 14:59.280
Girl inside will take
care of that for you.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.316
Hold up.

15:04.686 --> 15:07.722
Me, myself, I'd go key lime.

15:07.756 --> 15:09.724
Sounds like a winner.

15:09.758 --> 15:11.559

15:24.874 --> 15:26.842

15:55.940 --> 15:58.941
♪ ♪

16:15.693 --> 16:17.628
Oh, here we go.

16:17.662 --> 16:18.896
What's the problem?

16:18.930 --> 16:19.963
Don't got cash?

16:19.998 --> 16:21.565
It says here you take credit.

16:21.599 --> 16:24.501
This is why no one wants
the Langley jobs.

16:24.536 --> 16:25.869
Because of credit cards?

16:25.904 --> 16:28.405
'Cause these
paranoid spy types.

16:28.439 --> 16:29.673
They see you pass paper,

the rest of the day.

16:31.476 --> 16:33.444

16:37.482 --> 16:40.085
Sure you're not the one
who's paranoid?

Carrie?

17:03.645 --> 17:05.145
Oh, hi.

17:09.518 --> 17:11.484
Hey.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.752
Wow.

17:12.788 --> 17:14.955
It's, uh... it's...

17:14.990 --> 17:16.758
been a while.

17:16.791 --> 17:18.159
(exhales)

17:18.193 --> 17:20.561
Yeah.

17:20.596 --> 17:22.964
Uh, I'm supposed to stay

17:22.998 --> 17:24.464
- away from you.
- No.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.767
It's okay.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.335
No, I... I did
make that promise.

17:27.368 --> 17:29.437
Well...

17:29.471 --> 17:31.472
How are you?

17:31.507 --> 17:33.608
I'm well.

17:33.642 --> 17:34.976
(chuckles)

17:35.010 --> 17:36.111
You look it.

17:36.145 --> 17:37.946
And actually,
I owe that to you.

17:37.980 --> 17:39.313
How does that work?

17:39.348 --> 17:41.950
Well, you said
I should get help.

17:41.984 --> 17:43.418
And I did.

17:43.452 --> 17:47.221
And, uh,
it was a long road back,

17:47.256 --> 17:50.491
but I'm myself again.

17:50.525 --> 17:52.359
- Yeah, huh?
- Yeah.

17:52.394 --> 17:54.828
You kind of saved me.

17:54.863 --> 17:56.330
(scoffs)

17:56.364 --> 17:57.632
Anyway, um,

17:57.666 --> 18:00.334
I'm sure you're busy,
Congressman.

18:00.369 --> 18:01.902
Oh, yes.

18:01.937 --> 18:02.937
Yeah, congratulations.

18:02.971 --> 18:04.071
Thank you.

18:04.105 --> 18:05.306
And you?

18:05.340 --> 18:06.907
Are you back here?

18:06.942 --> 18:10.577
Um, yeah, in a way.

18:10.612 --> 18:11.912
What does that mean?

18:13.547 --> 18:15.548
I actually can't tell you.

18:15.583 --> 18:16.883
Hmm.

18:16.917 --> 18:18.284
I have good boundaries now.

18:18.319 --> 18:19.652
(laughs) Sure.

18:19.687 --> 18:21.587
It's part of being well.

18:21.621 --> 18:23.723
Right.

18:25.459 --> 18:26.826
Anyway, I'm glad I saw you.

18:26.861 --> 18:29.530
Yeah, me, too.

18:29.564 --> 18:32.500
(sighs)

18:32.534 --> 18:33.934
Peace?

18:37.473 --> 18:39.174
Peace.

18:42.912 --> 18:44.680
See you around.

18:57.394 --> 18:59.395
(banging on door)

19:03.334 --> 19:05.402
(banging continues)

19:05.436 --> 19:07.404
All right.

19:09.540 --> 19:12.141
There is a doorbell, you know,
for your convenience.

19:12.176 --> 19:14.043
Where's Brody?

19:14.077 --> 19:16.145
- He's not here.
- I need to talk to him.

19:16.180 --> 19:17.914
Well, you're out of luck.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.949
Then I'll wait.

19:22.086 --> 19:23.820
It's a shame, really.

19:23.854 --> 19:26.055
Hi, Betsy. Is he there?

19:28.058 --> 19:29.591
He was a good marine.

19:29.626 --> 19:30.926
How long does a vote take?

19:30.960 --> 19:34.162
A decent, reliable,
righteous marine.

19:34.197 --> 19:36.131
Yes, just leave a message.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.799
Someone twisted him up,

19:37.834 --> 19:39.769
put him on a bad path.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.137
Congressman or not,

19:41.171 --> 19:42.738
I'm not gonna let it slide.

19:42.772 --> 19:45.775
I'm gonna get to the bottom
of this murky pool of shit.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.143
(phone rings)

19:47.177 --> 19:48.277
Jess?

19:48.311 --> 19:50.079
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up?

19:50.113 --> 19:51.546
I need you.

19:51.581 --> 19:52.748
Okay.

19:52.782 --> 19:54.149
It's Lauder. He's here.

19:54.184 --> 19:55.718
Give me a minute, all right?

19:55.752 --> 19:57.152
Okay.

20:05.628 --> 20:07.596
That was good.

20:07.630 --> 20:10.266
Yeah, he's worried.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.533
How are you?

20:11.568 --> 20:13.302
I'm fine.

20:13.336 --> 20:15.103
Was it weird seeing him?

20:15.138 --> 20:17.138
Yeah, of course.

20:17.173 --> 20:18.706
So?

20:18.741 --> 20:19.841
Nice job.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.143
Thanks.

20:24.179 --> 20:26.313
You got a hook in his mouth.

20:26.348 --> 20:28.315
Yeah, we'll see.

20:28.349 --> 20:30.884
Lot of eyes.

20:30.919 --> 20:33.186
Tricky getting ears
in this building.

20:33.220 --> 20:34.687
Working on it.

20:34.722 --> 20:37.223
This is good.

20:42.062 --> 20:44.163
Oh, there he is.

20:44.197 --> 20:46.498
Now he's back at Rayburn.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.975
Good to see you again.

20:57.009 --> 20:58.910
Congressman Brody, a few words?

20:58.944 --> 21:02.714
Yeah, I can't promise
they'll be interesting, but...

21:06.419 --> 21:08.387
Do we put Roya Hammad
on the board?

21:08.421 --> 21:10.923
Yeah, we put them all up.

21:10.957 --> 21:13.425
PETER: Now, if we could only
hear what they're saying.

21:15.194 --> 21:17.129
Your tracks are covered
in Gettysburg.

21:17.163 --> 21:18.530
That's not it.

21:18.564 --> 21:20.631
Carrie Mathison was at the CIA.

21:20.666 --> 21:21.833
Today?

21:21.867 --> 21:23.568
She's working there again.

21:23.602 --> 21:25.536
- Did she say why?
- No.

21:25.571 --> 21:27.738
But if she's back in play,
it's got to be about me.

21:27.773 --> 21:28.906
Maybe not.

21:28.940 --> 21:30.140
It could be about Nazir.

21:30.175 --> 21:31.608
That's her expertise, right?

21:31.643 --> 21:32.910
Yeah.

21:32.944 --> 21:34.077
Yeah, right, but...

21:34.112 --> 21:35.379
The timing makes sense.

21:35.413 --> 21:37.281
They did just try
to assassinate him.

21:37.315 --> 21:38.849
That woman is stubborn as shit.

21:38.884 --> 21:40.417
She gets her head
around something...

21:40.452 --> 21:42.052
She was fully discredited.

21:42.087 --> 21:43.754
Then why is she
back at Langley?

21:43.788 --> 21:45.856
Well, if you're worried,
why don't you find out?

21:45.891 --> 21:47.425
Renew the relationship.

21:47.459 --> 21:49.194
(phone ringing)
Could be useful, actually.

21:52.298 --> 21:53.966
I should get going.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.168
Hey, wait.

21:56.202 --> 21:57.236
The tailor?

21:57.270 --> 21:59.138
It's taken care of.

21:59.173 --> 22:01.174
That was a fucking travesty.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.143
That should not have gone down.

22:03.177 --> 22:04.810
We've talked too long.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.846
Bye, now.

22:25.334 --> 22:27.301
(beeping)

22:29.170 --> 22:31.038
You were fucking him, huh?

22:32.107 --> 22:33.574
What?

22:33.609 --> 22:35.242
Brody.

22:35.277 --> 22:37.912
Who are you fucking?

22:37.946 --> 22:39.246
An ER nurse.

22:39.281 --> 22:41.015
I'm not that into her.

22:44.852 --> 22:46.820
You're pretty mouthy
for an analyst.

22:46.854 --> 22:49.622
I'm just saying,
if he did to me

22:49.657 --> 22:51.391
what he did to you,
got me fired

22:51.426 --> 22:53.894
and made me think I was crazy
when I wasn't,

22:53.928 --> 22:56.163
send me off to get
my brain zapped,

22:56.198 --> 22:58.332
I'd fucking rip his skin off.

22:58.367 --> 22:59.867
(sighs)

22:59.901 --> 23:02.236
Well, that's the plan.

23:07.542 --> 23:10.612
(exhales)

23:10.646 --> 23:11.846
Jessica's called four times.

23:11.881 --> 23:13.014
I know.

23:13.049 --> 23:15.016
Also, Rashid
from Constitutional Wash.

23:15.051 --> 23:16.384
What did he say?

23:16.419 --> 23:17.819
Your car is ready.

23:17.853 --> 23:19.854
Should I send someone?

23:21.223 --> 23:22.691
Yeah. (mumbles)

23:38.307 --> 23:39.875
Where is he?

23:39.909 --> 23:41.943
Passed out
on the kitchen table.

23:41.977 --> 23:44.278
- Fucking Lauder.
- He's a maniac.

23:44.313 --> 23:46.647
I already have one of those
on my hands.

23:46.681 --> 23:49.416
So you didn't kiss and
make up last night?

23:49.451 --> 23:51.818
I don't think we're ever
gonna kiss and make up.

23:51.853 --> 23:54.221
(phone ringing)

23:57.525 --> 23:59.760
(ringing continues)

23:59.794 --> 24:02.129
(door closes)

24:05.267 --> 24:06.734
JESSICA:
Hello?

24:06.768 --> 24:08.202
- Hi.
- Hi, Brody.

24:08.236 --> 24:09.736
What's going on?

24:09.771 --> 24:11.772
- Don't worry about it.
- Come on, Jess.

24:11.806 --> 24:13.474
I needed you an hour ago,

24:13.508 --> 24:15.109
and as usual, you were nowhere.

24:15.143 --> 24:16.877
So I called somebody
I can actually rely on.

24:16.912 --> 24:18.780
BRODY:
Who's there?

24:18.814 --> 24:20.148
Mike.

24:20.182 --> 24:21.649
He's taking care of it.

24:21.684 --> 24:23.918
Listen, I'll come home tonight.

24:23.953 --> 24:25.420
- We'll talk.
- No.

24:25.454 --> 24:27.088
You're gonna go to your hotel

24:27.122 --> 24:30.358
or wherever it is you go
when you disappear.

24:30.393 --> 24:31.360
(beep)

24:31.394 --> 24:33.361
(dial tone)

24:37.500 --> 24:39.502
(sighs)

24:41.205 --> 24:42.906
Oh, fuck a duck.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.941
Thank you.

24:44.976 --> 24:46.543
Yeah, of course.

24:46.577 --> 24:48.245
I'll call you.

24:49.915 --> 24:51.949
"I'll call you."

24:51.983 --> 24:53.617
Oh, shut up.

24:53.652 --> 24:55.219
No, no, no, no.

24:55.254 --> 24:57.956
I'm driving you
home, all right?

24:57.990 --> 25:00.658
Why don't you just say
what you mean?

25:00.693 --> 25:02.627
"I want to fuck tonight.
You game?"

25:02.662 --> 25:04.195
I know you're better
than this, Lauder.

25:04.230 --> 25:05.997
But every time you pull
this crap,

25:06.031 --> 25:07.632
it gets harder to remember that.

25:07.667 --> 25:09.634
I'm onto Brody.

25:11.070 --> 25:12.604
I don't even know
what that means.

25:12.638 --> 25:14.405
He knows something
about Walker's death,

25:14.439 --> 25:15.606
and he's covering.

25:15.640 --> 25:16.607
Why would he do that?

25:16.642 --> 25:18.442
Maybe he was a part of it.

25:20.479 --> 25:21.746
You need coffee. Come on.

25:21.780 --> 25:22.847
No.

25:22.881 --> 25:24.616
He was on the ground
that day, right?

25:24.650 --> 25:28.320
When-when Walker
shot that lady.

25:28.354 --> 25:30.155
So?

25:30.190 --> 25:32.291
So, they were a team.

25:32.325 --> 25:34.259
For years.

25:34.294 --> 25:36.528
Maybe they were working
together like old times.

25:38.565 --> 25:40.533
Buckle up.

25:40.567 --> 25:42.568
(shuts door)

25:43.736 --> 25:46.939
Jefferson sure did live it up.

25:46.973 --> 25:48.440
Wine, books...

25:48.474 --> 25:49.741
Slaves.
Yeah.

25:49.776 --> 25:52.678
How could he write,
"All men are created equal,"

25:52.712 --> 25:54.012
from a plantation?

25:54.047 --> 25:56.181
Dude was all confused.

25:56.216 --> 25:59.051
You ever been there?
Monticello?

25:59.085 --> 26:00.118
WALDEN:
Are you kidding?

26:00.153 --> 26:01.220
Hi, Dad.

26:01.254 --> 26:02.488
He's never heard of Monticello.

26:02.522 --> 26:04.489
Yes, I have.

26:04.524 --> 26:07.292
Anyway, uh,
we have a test tomorrow.

26:07.326 --> 26:10.228
- So, um...
- Okay.

26:10.263 --> 26:12.063
Who was his vice president?

26:12.098 --> 26:15.133
Jefferson's?

26:15.167 --> 26:16.634
Um...

26:16.669 --> 26:19.137
Nobody cares about the veep.

26:19.171 --> 26:21.472
- Aaron Burr.
- Oh...

26:21.507 --> 26:22.907
Right, the duel guy.

26:22.942 --> 26:24.876
WALDEN:
"The duel guy," brilliant.

26:24.911 --> 26:26.378
You can ride that
all the way to Yale.

26:26.412 --> 26:27.946
Look, I know that, all right?
I just blanked.

26:27.980 --> 26:30.382
Don't you know better
than to study with this guy?

26:30.416 --> 26:32.851
He's all about
the Gentleman's "C"s.

26:32.885 --> 26:34.819
He got an "A" on
yesterday's quiz.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.621
No kidding.

26:36.656 --> 26:38.723
DANA: Yeah, I guess
Gentleman's "C"s

26:38.758 --> 26:40.025
don't get you there anymore.

26:40.059 --> 26:41.928
Not like in your day.

26:43.530 --> 26:44.864
WALDEN:
Well...

26:44.898 --> 26:47.100
thank you for that wisdom, Dana.

26:49.803 --> 26:51.738
Did your dad make it home
okay last night?

26:51.772 --> 26:53.606
Yeah. He got home.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.641
Good.

26:56.843 --> 26:58.844
(door closes)

27:02.648 --> 27:04.615
(sighs)

27:04.650 --> 27:06.251
Anyway...

27:06.285 --> 27:08.085
Monticello?

27:08.120 --> 27:10.087
You want to go one weekend?

27:10.121 --> 27:11.688
How about right now?

27:13.057 --> 27:16.326
I think I have to
be home by dinner.

27:17.395 --> 27:19.597
Well, uh...

27:19.631 --> 27:21.598
let's go somewhere.

27:25.904 --> 27:28.038
All right.

27:28.073 --> 27:30.675
VIRGIL: Brody spoke to four
people on Capitol Hill,

27:30.709 --> 27:33.211
and 12 more at the Virginia
Businessmen's Reception.

27:33.245 --> 27:35.380
Plus a guy at a newsstand
on K Street.

27:35.414 --> 27:37.516
They all go up.

27:41.155 --> 27:42.322
Hey.

27:42.356 --> 27:43.757
How come I've never
heard of this guy?

27:43.791 --> 27:45.392
VIRGIL:
Who, Quinn?

27:45.427 --> 27:47.395
CARRIE: He was on the floor
at Langley six years?

27:47.429 --> 27:48.963
I never met him.

27:48.997 --> 27:50.765
That's because you
were in the Middle East.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.434
I don't know.
Look into him, would you?

27:52.468 --> 27:53.702
Oh, sure, I'm not busy.

27:53.736 --> 27:54.970
(sighs)

27:55.004 --> 27:56.104
Virgil, just check him out.

27:56.138 --> 27:57.906
- Please.
- Okay.

27:57.940 --> 28:01.142
- Give me a second, will you?
- Yeah.

28:03.212 --> 28:04.679
Carrie.

28:04.713 --> 28:07.249
Hi.

28:07.283 --> 28:09.351
I feel like a complete heel.

28:10.686 --> 28:12.087
Look, there's nothing to say,

28:12.121 --> 28:15.090
except I'm sorry,
and, um... good work.

28:15.125 --> 28:17.526
Well, that's enough.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.894
SAUL:
So...

28:22.332 --> 28:24.300
Seems a congressman
makes contact with 43 people

28:24.335 --> 28:25.568
in a typical day.

28:25.603 --> 28:26.803
We think there was a meet?

28:26.838 --> 28:28.238
Well, not an obvious one.

28:28.272 --> 28:29.639
PETER:
Unless we widen our circle,

28:29.673 --> 28:32.208
we can't keep a check on 43
people in any timely manner.

28:32.242 --> 28:33.843
We prioritize.

28:33.877 --> 28:35.612
First,
the dark-skinned ones.

28:35.646 --> 28:37.380
That's straight-up
racial profiling.

28:37.414 --> 28:38.481
It's actual profiling.

28:38.516 --> 28:40.383
Most al-Qaeda operatives
are gonna be

28:40.417 --> 28:41.951
Middle Eastern or African.

28:41.986 --> 28:42.986
Max.

28:44.421 --> 28:47.323
Okay, so who are
the top people of interest?

28:47.357 --> 28:48.491
Rashid Fadl.

28:48.525 --> 28:50.193
SAUL: Works at
Constitutional Car Wash.

28:50.227 --> 28:51.794
From Yemen,
has an expired visa.

28:51.829 --> 28:53.830
Paris Kimbe, cab driver,
Sudanese.

28:53.864 --> 28:56.199
Belongs to the same YMCA
as Car Wash Rashid.

28:56.233 --> 28:58.000
And Hamza Shabazi.

28:58.035 --> 29:00.002
Grad student,
blogs about Islamic women.

29:00.036 --> 29:01.937
Asked Brody to read her thesis.

29:01.972 --> 29:04.407
Brody's at a hotel tonight--
the Ashford.

29:04.441 --> 29:05.474
Why is that?

29:05.509 --> 29:06.709
PETER:
His woman sent him away.

29:06.743 --> 29:07.877
We're getting eyes in the room.

29:07.911 --> 29:09.779
Okay.

29:09.813 --> 29:11.815
Well, good work, everybody.

29:13.484 --> 29:14.885
I have to go see an apartment.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.553
What?

29:16.587 --> 29:18.021
I rented my house
when I went to Beirut.

29:26.496 --> 29:27.830
Looks like we're
the night shift.

29:28.865 --> 29:31.066
I don't have any plans.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.901
Like Indian food?

29:32.935 --> 29:34.436
- Uh, or Greek.
- Greek.

29:34.470 --> 29:36.371
Sure. I like olives.

29:37.406 --> 29:39.607
- I know a place.
- Good.

29:43.213 --> 29:45.180
(hip-hop music playing)

29:45.215 --> 29:47.283
♪ Inside my head,
I'm a wild boy ♪

29:47.317 --> 29:48.984
♪ This is all for fun,
uh-huh ♪

29:49.019 --> 29:51.086
♪ Feels like
I'm walking on the sun... ♪

29:54.991 --> 29:56.825
So...

29:56.859 --> 29:58.661
brand-new car
for your birthday, huh?

29:58.695 --> 29:59.862
Obnoxious, right?

29:59.896 --> 30:01.797
Yeah, big-time.

30:01.832 --> 30:04.266
Got to take the perks
where I can get 'em.

30:04.301 --> 30:06.836
Poor little rich boy.
(laughs)

30:06.870 --> 30:08.104
It's a sweet ride,
though, right?

30:08.138 --> 30:09.339
Yeah, it's okay.

30:09.373 --> 30:13.343
Ready for another perk?

30:13.377 --> 30:15.378
Sure. Yeah.

30:22.319 --> 30:24.721
I thought this was
closed for renovations.

30:24.755 --> 30:26.990
Not to Bill Walden's son.

30:27.024 --> 30:29.425
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.661
- Race you there.
- All right.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.306
(elevator door dings)

30:52.351 --> 30:54.986
Where's the Secret Service?

30:55.020 --> 30:56.321
Downstairs.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.857
So it's just us?

30:58.891 --> 31:00.792
Uh-huh.

31:02.862 --> 31:05.531
And...

31:05.565 --> 31:07.567
the entire
District of Columbia.

31:16.610 --> 31:20.781
Makes you realize there's this
whole big world out there.

31:20.815 --> 31:23.116
I like your attitude.

31:25.152 --> 31:26.519
I like you.

31:30.924 --> 31:32.692
Sorry.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.761
No.

31:57.915 --> 31:59.482
I have a boyfriend.

31:59.517 --> 32:01.518
I want to be your boyfriend.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.691
I know, I kind of
want that, too.

32:13.864 --> 32:15.865
I don't want to be
a dick, though.

32:18.035 --> 32:20.003
To the home guy?

32:23.040 --> 32:26.009
His name is Xander.

32:26.043 --> 32:28.044
He's... nice.

32:30.047 --> 32:32.849
But I'm nicer?

32:32.883 --> 32:35.685
No, you're meaner.
Ah.

32:35.719 --> 32:37.720
So it's the car.
(laughs)

32:41.391 --> 32:43.859
Just...

32:43.893 --> 32:45.560
let me talk to him.

32:45.594 --> 32:47.595
First.

32:49.398 --> 32:51.365
Do it soon. Okay?

32:59.074 --> 33:01.075
(radio plays quietly)

33:03.345 --> 33:04.645
Hey.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.647
He rises.

33:08.684 --> 33:09.884
Look, man, sorry.

33:11.354 --> 33:13.989
For what?

33:14.023 --> 33:17.459
I, unfortunately, remember
everything I said, and...

33:17.494 --> 33:19.962
the Jessica stuff, at least,
was out of line.

33:19.997 --> 33:22.566
Let's talk about
the other stuff.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.468
Okay.

33:24.502 --> 33:27.605
'Cause the fact is,
Brody's acting weird,

33:27.639 --> 33:30.107
and he has been
ever since he got back.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.642
He's not the same guy.

33:31.676 --> 33:32.810
Let's just say

33:32.844 --> 33:35.546
Brody and Walker
were working together

33:35.581 --> 33:39.016
that day that
Elizabeth Gaines was shot.

33:39.050 --> 33:41.018
Doing some covert work.

33:44.722 --> 33:46.289
Maybe for the CIA.

33:46.324 --> 33:49.159
Does Brody have
a connect with the spooks?

33:49.194 --> 33:50.461
Yeah.

33:50.495 --> 33:52.263
That's it--
that's fucking it!

33:52.297 --> 33:53.965
No, no, it's a theory.

33:53.999 --> 33:55.266
But let's say it was true.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.034
What was Brody's part?

33:57.068 --> 33:59.036
Fuck knows.

33:59.070 --> 34:01.272
And what does that mean
about who killed Walker?

34:08.480 --> 34:11.148
(bell dings)

34:11.181 --> 34:12.984
There you go.

34:13.018 --> 34:15.085
Thanks for staying
with us, Congressman.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.754
Thank you.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.065
PETER:
So, was it work or love?

34:27.100 --> 34:28.300
What?

34:28.333 --> 34:31.002
Brody.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.504
What are we, girlfriends?

34:33.539 --> 34:35.373
Just want to know
if you fell for him.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.809
Why don't you answer
some questions for me, Peter?

34:38.844 --> 34:40.210
Like?

34:40.246 --> 34:41.679
Like...

34:41.714 --> 34:44.215
um... where are you from?

34:44.248 --> 34:45.250
Philadelphia.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.217
The fancy part?
Mainline?

34:47.253 --> 34:48.253
Like that.

34:48.286 --> 34:49.554
Hill School, Harvard.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.922
Oh, good creds.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.891
Ah, it's a requirement
in our family.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.793
You ever go back to Philly?

34:54.827 --> 34:56.795
Ah, there's no
good Indian food.

34:59.332 --> 35:01.266
And why does Estes
like you so much?

35:01.300 --> 35:03.702
I'm pretty likable.

35:04.737 --> 35:06.004
Ah...

35:06.038 --> 35:09.307
That's a... matter of opinion.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.908
And reliable.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.877
I am extremely reliable.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.054
(phone ringing)

35:24.089 --> 35:25.055
Hi, Virgil.

35:25.090 --> 35:26.857
He's still not in the room.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.159
He's at the bar.

35:28.193 --> 35:29.460
(whispering):
He's at the bar.

35:29.494 --> 35:31.762
VIRGIL: Hotel security
let us in on their cameras.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.430
You'll have a picture
in a second.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.601
Yep, got it.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.604
VIRGIL:
Adios.

35:47.212 --> 35:48.980
Can I get another?

36:12.838 --> 36:14.805
PETER:
Now, call your contact.

36:32.723 --> 36:34.858
Do it, man.

36:34.892 --> 36:37.327
You know you want to.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.600
(button beeps)

36:45.638 --> 36:47.105
(cell phone rings)

36:51.211 --> 36:52.311
Hello?

36:52.345 --> 36:53.312
BRODY:
Hi.

36:53.346 --> 36:54.312
Hi.

36:54.347 --> 36:55.347
Do you know who this is?

36:55.381 --> 36:56.681
I do. How are you?

36:56.716 --> 36:58.784
I've been better.

36:58.818 --> 37:00.485
Yeah?

37:00.520 --> 37:03.422
I was, um...

37:03.456 --> 37:05.958
I was just wondering
if we, uh...

37:05.992 --> 37:06.958
(clears throat)

37:06.993 --> 37:08.193
...if we could bury the hatchet.

37:08.227 --> 37:09.961
For real.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.629
Didn't we do that today?

37:12.664 --> 37:14.898
Can we seal it with a drink?

37:15.934 --> 37:18.669
Sure. Please.

37:18.703 --> 37:20.971
I'm at the Ashford Hotel.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.239
There's a bar...

37:22.273 --> 37:24.308
Uh, yeah, no, I know it.
It's 20 minutes away.

37:24.342 --> 37:25.876
Good. Yeah.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.712
Right.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.682
Holy shit.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.317
It's on.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.317
Hell, yeah.

37:33.352 --> 37:35.219
So what's the play?

37:35.254 --> 37:37.021
Well, as far as we know,

37:37.056 --> 37:38.689
he didn't go to his handler yet.

37:38.724 --> 37:41.326
So we spook him more?
Make him report back?

37:41.360 --> 37:43.061
Drop something about Abu Nazir?

37:43.096 --> 37:44.963
Straight out?

37:44.997 --> 37:45.997
Too bold?

37:48.868 --> 37:51.369
Ah, screw it.
We don't have a lot of time.

37:51.404 --> 37:53.905
These fuckers are
planning something.

37:53.940 --> 37:55.474
I'll loop everyone in.

37:56.443 --> 37:58.844
Crap. I'm nervous.

37:58.878 --> 38:01.413
I'm not. You're good.

38:01.448 --> 38:03.649
Okay.

38:03.683 --> 38:04.950
Right.

38:04.985 --> 38:07.486
Thanks.

38:11.424 --> 38:13.292
(cell phone chiming)

38:48.559 --> 38:52.061
You and me and bars.

38:52.095 --> 38:53.496
It always ends up in

38:53.530 --> 38:55.798
an interesting way,
though, doesn't it?

38:55.832 --> 38:57.399
So far.

38:57.434 --> 39:00.402
Mmm. Mmm!

39:00.437 --> 39:03.139
By the way, this is
not a booty call.

39:03.173 --> 39:04.406
Uh, didn't even cross my mind.

39:04.441 --> 39:05.908
Just wanted to say
that up front.

39:05.942 --> 39:08.544
Done.

39:08.579 --> 39:09.779
(chuckles)

39:09.813 --> 39:11.347
I'm not here by choice.

39:11.381 --> 39:13.082
My wife's fed up.

39:13.117 --> 39:14.350
Oh. Well, that can't
be good politics.

39:14.384 --> 39:16.986
You're supposed to be
the new JFK and Jackie.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.355
So it all ends with a bullet
in my brain, huh?

39:19.390 --> 39:21.791
Whoa. Dark turn.

39:21.826 --> 39:25.528
(chuckling):
Yeah. Sorry.

39:27.031 --> 39:29.065
How's she doing?

39:29.100 --> 39:30.533
Reeling him in.

39:31.669 --> 39:33.770
BRODY:
So, how are you?

39:33.805 --> 39:36.740
Well, I told you,
I'm... I'm good.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.141
And you're working again?

39:38.176 --> 39:40.144
I am.

39:40.178 --> 39:43.281
And, uh...
I'm getting pretty close.

39:43.315 --> 39:46.484
To?

39:46.518 --> 39:48.353
My goal.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.723
Vague. Extremely vague.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.925
(chuckling):
Yes, well,

39:53.959 --> 39:55.560
I can't name names.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.328
No, of course.

39:57.363 --> 40:01.399
But I'm circling
a certain terrorist.

40:01.434 --> 40:03.068
Hey, so long as it's not me.

40:03.102 --> 40:05.237
No, no, no, no. My focus is back
on the right guy.

40:05.271 --> 40:06.672
The big guy.

40:06.706 --> 40:08.073
The head-of-the-snake guy.

40:11.077 --> 40:14.813
(softly): Who stole
eight years of your life.

40:21.821 --> 40:24.690
Anyway, no, I should, uh...

40:24.725 --> 40:26.893
I should shut up.

40:33.301 --> 40:36.036
Hey, listen, Carrie.

40:36.071 --> 40:37.204
(sighs)

40:37.239 --> 40:40.174
You said sorry to me 100 times.

40:40.208 --> 40:43.043
CARRIE:
You need 101?

40:43.078 --> 40:44.712
BRODY:
No, no. It's my turn.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.046
I've felt crappy

40:46.081 --> 40:48.949
about what happened,
tricking you.

40:48.983 --> 40:50.618
Calling Estes.

40:50.652 --> 40:53.355
Oh, that.

40:53.389 --> 40:55.924
I did it 'cause I
was worried about you.

40:57.026 --> 41:00.028
Well, it was worrisome...

41:00.062 --> 41:02.196
my behavior.

41:02.231 --> 41:04.398
I'm sorry for all
you went through.

41:04.433 --> 41:05.733
No, don't be.

41:05.767 --> 41:08.336
I mean, fucking ECT?

41:08.371 --> 41:09.771
Where'd you hear that?

41:09.806 --> 41:11.440
I asked about you.

41:11.475 --> 41:12.541
Oh.

41:12.576 --> 41:14.944
Did you have to do it a lot?

41:16.513 --> 41:19.248
Uh, Mondays and Thursdays
for six weeks.

41:19.282 --> 41:21.050
Was it terrible?

41:21.084 --> 41:24.554
No.

41:26.623 --> 41:29.758
No, no. Um...

41:31.495 --> 41:36.432
Truthfully, you don't even
feel a thing, so...

41:36.467 --> 41:38.768
Well, that which
makes you stronger.

41:38.802 --> 41:40.737
Right. Right.

41:51.680 --> 41:54.282
Well...

41:54.316 --> 41:55.583
I'm glad we did this.

41:55.617 --> 41:57.852
Well, that's it?

41:57.886 --> 42:01.956
Yeah, I got... I got
an early morning.

42:01.990 --> 42:03.491
Okay. Well, I-I got it.

42:03.525 --> 42:04.926
No, don't be silly.

42:04.960 --> 42:08.029
Uh, room 416, please.

42:20.409 --> 42:21.442
Brody, I...

42:21.477 --> 42:23.477
It was really good seeing you.

42:55.145 --> 42:56.846
(sighs)

43:11.160 --> 43:12.727
(sighs)

43:12.761 --> 43:15.263
(phone rings)

43:15.298 --> 43:16.365
That was great.

43:16.399 --> 43:17.900
No, that was terrible.

43:17.934 --> 43:19.434
What'd you expect,
a confession?

43:19.469 --> 43:21.003
He made me.

43:21.037 --> 43:24.072
No way. He's on his way
up to his room.

43:24.107 --> 43:25.540
He's acting totally normal.

43:25.575 --> 43:26.608
Peter, he knows.

43:26.643 --> 43:29.278
Saul and I watched
the whole thing.

43:29.312 --> 43:30.312
No. Put Saul on.

43:33.650 --> 43:34.950
You did fine, Carrie.

43:34.984 --> 43:36.051
No.

43:36.085 --> 43:38.353
No, I got pissed
when he talked about ECT.

43:38.388 --> 43:39.688
I showed my hand
for the slightest second,

43:39.722 --> 43:41.089
and he saw.

43:41.124 --> 43:43.926
He saw, and... he went away.

43:43.960 --> 43:46.228
That's not how we read it here.

43:46.263 --> 43:48.964
We have to go in.
He's on to me.

43:48.999 --> 43:51.100
Come back, Carrie.

43:51.134 --> 43:53.436
Saul, I saw it in his eyes.

43:53.470 --> 43:56.239
He'll send a signal-- he'll put
a wine glass in the window,

43:56.273 --> 43:57.573
whatever,
and they'll go to ground.

43:57.608 --> 43:58.841
We go in now.

43:58.875 --> 44:00.743
Because you saw it in his eyes?

44:00.777 --> 44:02.044
Yeah, that's right.

44:02.078 --> 44:04.980
Your work is done tonight.
Get the fuck back here.

44:11.487 --> 44:13.255
(sighs)

44:26.001 --> 44:27.367
PETER:
Jesus, how many times

44:27.402 --> 44:28.635
you got to tell her something?

44:28.670 --> 44:30.637
A lot.

45:01.601 --> 45:03.735
(sighs)

45:11.143 --> 45:12.843
(knocking)

45:35.233 --> 45:37.534
Hi.

45:37.569 --> 45:39.569
Hi.

45:43.275 --> 45:44.842
(chuckles)

45:46.344 --> 45:48.512
SAUL Oh, what is she doing?

45:48.547 --> 45:51.382
CARRIE: "Why did he
mention his room number?"

45:51.416 --> 45:54.218
I asked myself.

45:54.253 --> 45:56.954
Was it just to pay the bill?

45:56.988 --> 46:00.691
Or maybe...?

46:00.726 --> 46:04.194
Maybe... to get you alone...

46:04.229 --> 46:05.996
again.

46:10.235 --> 46:12.036
It reeks, you know.

46:12.070 --> 46:14.271
(chuckles) My confusion?

46:14.306 --> 46:15.673
Your bullshit.

46:15.707 --> 46:16.840
BRODY:
I don't follow.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.008
She's blowing it.
It's blown.

46:18.043 --> 46:20.678
Take the goddamn room,
goddamn it.

46:20.712 --> 46:22.680
We only have a few
more minutes alone.

46:26.418 --> 46:29.187
You still have your twisted
theories about me, don't you?

46:29.221 --> 46:30.889
Not theories anymore.

46:30.923 --> 46:32.991
Look, I'm sorry I called.

46:33.025 --> 46:34.626
I-I guess I thought
we could be friends.

46:34.660 --> 46:38.262
Friends? Oh, yeah.

46:38.297 --> 46:39.530
Yeah, do I want to be friends

46:39.565 --> 46:41.199
with a demented ex-soldier

46:41.233 --> 46:42.700
who hates America?

46:42.734 --> 46:44.468
Who decided strapping on a bomb

46:44.503 --> 46:46.237
was the answer to
what ailed him?

46:46.271 --> 46:48.405
Despite his daughter, his son,

46:48.440 --> 46:50.074
people who loved him
in real life,

46:50.108 --> 46:52.776
not in the mind-fuck
world of Abu Nazir?

46:52.811 --> 46:55.612
Who, in the end, didn't have the
stones to go through with it,

46:55.647 --> 46:57.581
but had no problem
sending me to the nuthouse?

46:57.616 --> 47:01.386
Yeah. No, thanks.

47:01.420 --> 47:03.955
I don't think I need
a friend like that.

47:03.989 --> 47:07.593
Okay. Not friends.

47:07.627 --> 47:09.328
Get the fuck away from her.

47:09.362 --> 47:10.529
So what are you gonna do now?

47:10.563 --> 47:11.564
Are you gonna kill me?

47:11.598 --> 47:14.199
You gonna blame it
on rough sex, maybe?

47:14.234 --> 47:15.834
I mean, how long
can you get away

47:15.869 --> 47:17.203
with something like that?

47:17.237 --> 47:19.805
- I've had a pretty good run so far.
- It's true.

47:19.840 --> 47:22.108
I seem to be good at this.

47:22.142 --> 47:23.510
If nothing else.

47:23.544 --> 47:24.778
You're special.

47:27.081 --> 47:28.448
I liked you, Carrie.

47:28.482 --> 47:30.417
I <i>loved</i> you.

47:33.121 --> 47:35.956
Police! Hands behind your back!

47:35.990 --> 47:37.958
- On the floor!
- Get down!

47:37.992 --> 47:38.992
Relax!

47:39.026 --> 47:41.428
- Get down!
- Get on the floor!

47:41.463 --> 47:42.796
You good?

47:46.734 --> 47:49.503
(Brody groaning)

47:49.538 --> 47:52.640
If only the circumstances
had been wildly different.

47:55.343 --> 47:57.711
You're a disgrace to your
nation, Sergeant Nicholas Brody.

47:57.746 --> 47:59.013
You're a traitor and terrorist.

47:59.047 --> 48:00.915
And now it's time
you pay for that.
