12:11.731 --> 12:13.733
your plus-one
to Everett's party.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.560
Um, I know you're here
covering it for work.

12:15.604 --> 12:18.085
Yeah. Um, does your family
normally throw parties

12:18.128 --> 12:20.217
every time one of you
gets off on murder charges

12:20.261 --> 12:22.045
when weird stuff is
happening all over town?

12:22.089 --> 12:24.787
Well, it is gonna take
a lot more than crazy weather

12:24.831 --> 12:27.572
for Celia to not throw
a party, trust me.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.052
[phone buzzing]Ah. Um...

12:29.096 --> 12:30.793
I got to take this.
One second.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.403
Yeah, of course, yeah.Hello?

12:32.447 --> 12:34.754
Your mother invited me
to Everett's party.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.320
When she said
"black tie optional,"

12:36.364 --> 12:38.758
was that a trick?VAL:
Hey, should we order in?

12:38.801 --> 12:40.020
They were calling
for rain.

12:40.063 --> 12:41.804
Yeah, that's a good idea.Yeah? Okay.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.501
Is that Val Samuels?

12:43.545 --> 12:44.938
What is she doing here?

12:44.981 --> 12:46.591
[quietly]:
She's having lunch with me
right now.

12:46.635 --> 12:49.333
Something's not right
about that, Ryan.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.814
I-I think she's sniffing around
for a reason.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.164
Yeah, or she just enjoys
my company.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.123
Look,
we've been keeping in touch

12:56.166 --> 12:57.689
since she wrote the article
about me,

12:57.733 --> 12:59.909
and I got to tell you,
I'm actually...

12:59.953 --> 13:02.216
Are you talking to me
about your love life right now?

13:02.259 --> 13:03.913
Yeah.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.698
Yeah, I guess I am.
Is that... is that weird?

13:06.742 --> 13:09.876
[knocking]Wasn't until just now. Bye.

13:09.919 --> 13:12.574
O-Okay. Bye.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.234
I went back to Icarus Hall.

exactly what happened
in Icarus Hall,

15:24.358 --> 15:26.055
1939, Christmas Eve.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.665
According to
The Horseshoe Bay Gazette,

15:27.709 --> 15:29.841
it was a gas leak
that killed the Icarans.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.931
And now their phantoms
haunt the hall.

15:31.974 --> 15:35.064
Since when do ghosts get so mad
about gas?They don't.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.371

Nothing more
on phantoms yet.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.993
So, have you always been
into magic,

15:51.037 --> 15:53.561
or did you want
to be Black Harry Potter?

15:53.604 --> 15:55.084
[both laugh]

15:55.128 --> 15:57.869
Yeah. Harry with
Kobe's jump shot, right?

15:57.913 --> 15:59.871
Yeah, and I wanted to be Harry
with Dumbledore's fits.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.004
[laughing]:
Okay. Yeah, you'd look good.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.266
Damn!

16:03.310 --> 16:05.703
Who did that to you?

16:05.747 --> 16:07.792
Oh, yeah, your
lineup is an act

16:07.836 --> 16:09.142
of violence.Yeah.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.795
I did it myself.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.972
See, I went into
the Horseshoe Bay barbershop,

16:13.015 --> 16:15.713
but the guy took one look
at my hair, had a panic attack.

16:15.757 --> 16:18.455
So I'm taking it you went
to a white barber?

Look, I am so sorry about that.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.766
Yeah, I mean, uh,
there's a Black barbershop

16:24.809 --> 16:26.986
like three hours from here,
but mostly, it's just...

16:27.029 --> 16:29.205
it's just me,
my clippers and YouTube.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.164

uh, double clips...Uh-huh.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.166
...and you just slide it across
the back and just don't...

16:33.209 --> 16:35.037

talking about?

16:35.081 --> 16:37.170
Nothing.

Nothing. We're
just-just...

Hey, it's just...
it's just... it's...

16:46.179 --> 16:49.704
It's just cool to finally talk
to someone my age who's Black.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.013
So, you're a different person

16:54.056 --> 16:55.405
when you're not around
other Black people?

16:55.449 --> 16:59.235
I mean, it's more complicated
than that, but...

16:59.279 --> 17:01.063
kind of?

17:01.107 --> 17:02.412
Hey. Hey,

17:02.456 --> 17:04.632
look, okay, let's talk
about it tonight, okay?

17:04.675 --> 17:07.200
No code-switching,
nothing, all right?

17:07.243 --> 17:09.028
I'm still taking you
on that date, you know.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.768
Okay, well,
the town is falling apart,

17:10.812 --> 17:12.466
so it's dangerous
to go outside.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.294
Well, if the world is gonna end,

17:14.337 --> 17:16.470
I want to end it next to you.

17:16.513 --> 17:20.952
Hey, tracked down the crime
scene photos from the '30s.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.867
You guys want
to go for a ride?

17:22.911 --> 17:24.391
Sure, let's pre-game.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.870
Well, first, I need a favor.

to be chasing Ryan.

17:28.743 --> 17:31.093
I think she's working
against him, but I need proof.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.834
Uh, Ace, can you hack
into Ryan's phone

17:32.877 --> 17:34.705
so I can figure out which
hotel room she's staying in,

17:34.749 --> 17:36.055
steal her laptop?

17:36.098 --> 17:38.013
ACE:
Yeah.Let us know what you find out.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.885
I wasn't gonna ask you
to steal. I'm not...

17:40.929 --> 17:42.844
No, no, no. No, you're not
enabling my addiction.

17:42.887 --> 17:43.975
No, no, no, I only get, like,

17:44.019 --> 17:45.325
a buzz off shiny things,
remember? So,

17:45.368 --> 17:46.804
I'll do it.

you're sitting there.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.564

to get to know you better.

18:09.566 --> 18:12.047
I want that, too.

18:12.091 --> 18:16.269

18:16.312 --> 18:19.185

take a second.

18:52.392 --> 18:54.176
Hey, Nick. How did it go?

18:54.220 --> 18:58.137
Uh, Ace's dad found this for us
in the police station archives.

19:00.095 --> 19:03.054
Yeah, back in the 1930s,
the police photographer in town

19:03.098 --> 19:04.143
held onto his prints.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.492
The department
kept the portfolio.

19:07.537 --> 19:10.105
Wait. That one. That one.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.152
That is definitely Icarus Hall.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.936
That's not a gas leak.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.590
That's people
slaughtering each other.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.244
Now I get the cover-up.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.246
That's pretty bad PR
for the patriarchy.

19:20.289 --> 19:21.769
Thanks, Nick.NICK:
Yup.

19:21.812 --> 19:23.901
If I dial up the concentration

19:23.945 --> 19:25.860
of beryllium
in the outer compartment,

19:25.903 --> 19:27.253
maybe this carrying
case I designed

19:27.296 --> 19:29.255
for the meteorite can
protect us from its effects.

19:29.298 --> 19:32.083
Wait. Do you really think that
the meteorite caused the Icarans

19:32.127 --> 19:33.868
to go mad and start
killing each other?

19:33.911 --> 19:35.435
Because that thing was
traveled around in carnivals

19:35.478 --> 19:37.263
for a decade,
and no one ever got slaughtered.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.961
It's packed full
of rare cosmic isotopes.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.137
Any one of them could have hit
an awkward half-life

19:42.181 --> 19:44.531
in 1939
and driven the Icarans mad.

19:44.574 --> 19:46.881
Okay, then, you take care
of counteracting the isotopes,

19:46.924 --> 19:49.666
and I am going to try
and figure out

19:49.710 --> 19:51.712
what made the phantoms
so vengeful.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.193
Cool, you do that,

19:54.236 --> 19:57.805
and I'll pretend anything
you just said makes sense.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.296
I amthe real Nick.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.341
Mm-hmm.But...

20:13.429 --> 20:15.866
I don't like Lemon Demon.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.870
"Cabinet Man" is
our favorite song.

20:19.914 --> 20:22.569
No. No, I...
I googled "Cabinet Man"

20:22.612 --> 20:24.614
because I liked you.

20:24.658 --> 20:27.226
Also, I've never seen Friends.

20:27.269 --> 20:30.185
Wait. Even after
I binge-watched it?

20:30.229 --> 20:34.189
Look, being one of the only
Black guys in a town like this

20:34.233 --> 20:37.323
isn't just about haircuts
and-and

20:37.366 --> 20:40.326
favorite songs.

20:42.153 --> 20:44.199
There's this guy in The Claw,

20:44.243 --> 20:47.202
and he comes in every week.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.248
And he loves to sing along
with rap lyrics,

20:49.291 --> 20:52.033
and he says the "N" word a lot.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.122
So why don't you just
tell him to stop?

20:54.165 --> 20:55.645
Because then they just say,

20:55.689 --> 20:57.865
"Why do you get to say it,
but I don't?"

20:57.908 --> 20:59.867
And then I have to argue
with them

20:59.910 --> 21:01.782
about how
that word is offensive,

21:01.825 --> 21:05.481
knowing full well
that they are not gonna hear me.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.788
[sighs]

21:07.831 --> 21:11.052
Explaining yourself all the time

21:11.095 --> 21:14.098
is just exhausting.

21:18.494 --> 21:22.237
It's easier just to keep quiet
than...

21:22.281 --> 21:25.022
be the angry Black guy.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.589
Hey.

Hey.

32:39.522 --> 32:40.959
Stop!

32:41.002 --> 32:42.656
[grunts]

32:43.613 --> 32:44.701
[rumbling]

32:44.745 --> 32:46.181
What is that?

32:49.837 --> 32:51.447
The hex is fighting back.

32:57.888 --> 33:01.240
[chuckles]Hey. No! No, no![grunts]

33:01.283 --> 33:03.024
Damn it.
We have to finish this ritual.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.417
Please tell me

33:04.460 --> 33:06.767
you have a fire extinguisher
on that holster thing?

33:06.810 --> 33:09.117
I don't, but...

33:09.161 --> 33:11.119
Okay. Uh, Barclay,

33:11.163 --> 33:13.513
on my mark,
vibrate at 50 terahertz.

33:13.556 --> 33:15.471
Ready?BARCLAY:
Ready.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.041
Oh!

33:20.085 --> 33:21.347
[both panting, grunting]

33:24.002 --> 33:25.699
Now.[vibrating]

33:28.745 --> 33:31.052
You're using a piece
of wood as a fire hose.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.272
You just started a fire
with your blood.

33:33.315 --> 33:35.187
[yells]

33:45.762 --> 33:47.112
How did you...?

33:47.155 --> 33:48.591
Everything organic
is partially made up of water.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.506
And if vibrated
at the right frequency

33:50.550 --> 33:52.247
by something
as powerful as Barclay,

33:52.291 --> 33:53.814
everything
becomes a fire hose.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.120
"With my blood,

33:55.163 --> 33:56.773
"I erase the veil

33:56.817 --> 33:59.515
and free the afflicted."

34:00.908 --> 34:03.998
"Once the bundles turn to ash,
the hex is broken."

34:04.042 --> 34:05.869
We did it.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.443
[gasps]

34:14.487 --> 34:16.619
[breathing shakily]

34:18.839 --> 34:21.537
Ace. What...

34:23.974 --> 34:26.020
Did we get the meteorite?

34:26.064 --> 34:28.892
[panting]

34:34.768 --> 34:36.813
[grunts softly]

34:42.210 --> 34:44.343
Now I can build my dad
a spaceship.

34:53.787 --> 34:55.310
Hey.Hey.

34:55.354 --> 34:56.703
Somebody left this at my house

34:56.746 --> 34:59.053
with your emails
on the home screen.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.359
Give me one reason

35:00.402 --> 35:01.795
why I shouldn't
turn you in to the cops.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.449
Well,
if you were serious about it,

35:03.492 --> 35:04.928
I'd be in jail already.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.930
But you're not really
on your parents' side, are you?

35:06.974 --> 35:08.802
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that I'm okay

35:08.845 --> 35:11.892
with you blackmailing my mother
and endangering Nancy.

35:11.935 --> 35:14.068
Look, I haven't gone public
about Nancy yet,

35:14.112 --> 35:15.548
and I'm not going to.

35:15.591 --> 35:19.987
I had to blackmail your mother
as an insurance policy.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.772
Gonna bring down your father,

35:22.816 --> 35:24.818
which is the only way
to keep Nancy safe

35:24.861 --> 35:27.081
and, I don't know,
win a Pulitzer while I'm at it.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.735
But, also,

35:28.778 --> 35:33.087
I can see that underneath
this billionaire candy shell,

35:33.131 --> 35:36.917
that there's a decent man
who wants to do what's right.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.269
[sighs]
And maybe...

35:42.923 --> 35:46.753
Maybe I just don't feel
like hurting you.

35:49.756 --> 35:50.974
NANCY:
Once the hex was broken,

35:51.018 --> 35:52.585
the phantoms were finally able
to move on.

35:52.628 --> 35:55.240
Why did the Women in White want
to kill them in the first place?

35:55.283 --> 35:58.068
Well, here's what I took
from the Historical Society.

35:58.112 --> 36:00.462
So, in 1920,
women won the right to vote.

36:00.506 --> 36:01.942
Right.NANCY:
Then when the Icarans

36:01.985 --> 36:03.726
took over Horseshoe Bay,
they started barring women

36:03.770 --> 36:06.860
from casting ballots through
intimidation and violence.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.209
Fear a Woman in
White scorned.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.993
That's not the end
of the story.Yeah.

36:10.037 --> 36:11.560
I was thinking
about what we saw in there.

36:11.604 --> 36:13.736
I counted
only eight phantoms,

36:13.780 --> 36:15.738
but I remember seeing
ten Icarans in the photos.

36:15.782 --> 36:19.655
So it turns out two of them
survived the massacre.

36:22.092 --> 36:25.095
They left Horseshoe Bay,
went to Boston

36:25.139 --> 36:26.967
and rebranded themselves.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.708
That logo...

36:35.105 --> 36:37.934
The Icarans
became The Road Back.

36:37.978 --> 36:41.111
The Illuminati group that
went after my brother's mom.

36:41.155 --> 36:42.939
That's why he grew up
in witness protection.

36:42.983 --> 36:44.811
NANCY:
According to the dark corners
of the Web,

36:44.854 --> 36:46.769
The Road Back
has people everywhere.

36:46.813 --> 36:49.642
Governments, business, law.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.426
But there's no official trace
of them out there.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.254
The operative phrase
being "out there"

36:53.298 --> 36:54.777
in the big wide world,

36:54.821 --> 36:57.954
no longer here in
your nice little town.

37:06.963 --> 37:10.271
Celestial radiation
suppressed.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.794
Temporarily.

37:11.838 --> 37:14.057
Just like what needs
to happen with you.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.756
Put Nancy Drew in
a beryllium box?

37:16.799 --> 37:19.628
While Nancy Hudson
does what needs to be done

37:19.672 --> 37:22.065
to survive
her billionaire family.

37:22.109 --> 37:23.458
I'm not psychic,

37:23.502 --> 37:26.331
but that spell book
from Temperance Hudson you used

37:26.374 --> 37:28.463
specifically said
"my blood,"

37:28.507 --> 37:30.813
as in DNA.

37:30.857 --> 37:34.730
Therefore,
you must be a Hudson.

37:36.036 --> 37:40.258
Hey, your secret is safe
with me, Nancy.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.481
Let's make a deal.

37:46.525 --> 37:48.875
I'll try
putting some armor on

37:48.918 --> 37:51.573
if you try
taking yours off.

37:51.617 --> 37:54.097
Unless you wanted to live
in a beryllium box

37:54.141 --> 37:56.274
with Geraldine forever,
which, if you do, I get it.

37:56.317 --> 37:59.146
Look, I've tried explaining
the truth to my dad,

37:59.189 --> 38:02.062
but words have just
failed us, so...

38:02.105 --> 38:04.151
Maybe you need something
more than words.

38:06.545 --> 38:09.417
Honestly? Screw it.
[chuckles]

38:09.461 --> 38:11.898
My trust is
already vested.

38:11.941 --> 38:16.206
Now I just need to find
a gorgeous man to kiss,

38:16.250 --> 38:17.773
put it on the Internet,

38:17.817 --> 38:20.385
and there's no way
my dad will pretend anymore.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.169
Yeah.

38:22.212 --> 38:23.344
Hey, Nick,

38:23.388 --> 38:25.346
help your boy out.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.392
One pic, no tongue.

38:27.435 --> 38:29.045
[chuckles]O-Okay.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.700
Never talk about my
hairline again, and I'm in.

38:31.744 --> 38:34.224
Oh, brother, it's flawless.
Like Lebron's.

38:34.268 --> 38:35.530
Oh, right. Hey,

38:35.574 --> 38:37.358
is, uh, is a photo
okay with you?

38:37.402 --> 38:40.796
There's an extra person
living in my body. You're good.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.364
Okay, let's do it.

38:43.408 --> 38:44.757
All right.

38:44.800 --> 38:48.761
Use the presets.
Touch nothing.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.503
Uh, you mind taking
this off for me?

38:51.546 --> 38:53.940
All right. Okay. Okay.Come on, let's
give them a show.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.943
Okay. Okay.[Bess chuckles]

38:56.986 --> 38:59.859
Thank you.You're welcome.

39:04.298 --> 39:06.735
[camera clicks]

39:06.779 --> 39:08.737
[phone chimes]

39:08.781 --> 39:11.871
I posted it
on your live feed, Tom.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.745
They're saying Nick's
biceps look like thighceps.

39:16.789 --> 39:19.792
Oh, that's very kind
of you, Internet. [chuckles]

39:19.835 --> 39:23.056
Oh, this is gonna take some
explaining to my dad, but hey.

39:23.099 --> 39:25.754
And now I can stop
explaining to my dad.

39:25.798 --> 39:28.409
Thanks, Nick.GEORGE:
Yo, there's, like,

39:28.453 --> 39:31.151
ten comments here
that just say "eyes." Come here.

39:31.194 --> 39:32.413
You got to kiss me next.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.067
I wonder, does Emily Tyson
still follow me?

39:34.110 --> 39:35.460
She's gonna be so jealous.

39:35.503 --> 39:37.505
[chuckles][clears throat]

39:37.549 --> 39:39.855
[camera clicks]

39:39.899 --> 39:43.163
Grandpa Fan
will just have to deal.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.254
It was a pleasure
working together.

39:47.297 --> 39:49.299
Even though
I constantly disagreed with you?

39:49.343 --> 39:51.824
Actually,
I found it kind of refreshing.

39:51.867 --> 39:54.130
[whirring]

40:02.356 --> 40:04.314
Your armor is here.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.752
I already Venmo'd
your payment,

40:06.795 --> 40:08.710
but here's a bonus.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.993
This is incredible.

40:31.820 --> 40:36.521
In Balmain, Nancy
Drew is bulletproof.

40:37.347 --> 40:39.262
Thank you.[phone buzzing]

40:39.306 --> 40:42.222
BARCLAY:
Tom, it's your father calling.

40:42.265 --> 40:45.225
Guess my dad saw the pic.
[chuckles]

40:45.268 --> 40:48.446
I'm gonna take
this in the car.

40:49.229 --> 40:51.492
Hello? Dad?

40:51.536 --> 40:52.493
Barclay,

40:52.537 --> 40:54.887
driving mode.[engine starts]

40:54.930 --> 40:57.455
Dad, hold on.

40:58.934 --> 41:01.067
I found the meteorite.

41:01.110 --> 41:03.330
Yeah.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.638
I'm sending you to Saturn.

41:08.117 --> 41:10.337
See you soon.

41:27.615 --> 41:31.532
So, who wants to clean out
the grease traps?

41:31.576 --> 41:33.621
I do.

41:33.665 --> 41:38.147
What better way to spend my
last night as Nancy Drew?

41:39.671 --> 41:42.804
Tomorrow, the world
meets Nancy Hudson.

42:23.497 --> 42:24.977
[woman screams, bell dings]

42:25.499 --> 42:25.978
[pencil scribbling]
