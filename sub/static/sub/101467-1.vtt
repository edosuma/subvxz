00:50.069 --> 00:51.871
The fires are getting worse.

00:54.974 --> 00:56.676
Every year it's getting worse.

01:01.815 --> 01:03.716
I say let it burn.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.418
Let it all burn.

01:08.855 --> 01:10.523
I owe you for this one.

01:18.765 --> 01:22.735
Warner Hayes is back in town,
back in The Network.

01:25.004 --> 01:26.406
I won't fight him.

01:33.413 --> 01:35.481
Hayes, stop!

01:37.083 --> 01:38.418
Stop!

01:39.419 --> 01:40.887
You were out!

01:40.920 --> 01:42.755
Why are you doing this?

01:42.789 --> 01:44.357
I got no choice!

01:48.094 --> 01:49.362
If he comes for me...

01:51.497 --> 01:52.565
<i>You were out.</i>

01:53.466 --> 01:54.868
There is no way out.

01:55.935 --> 01:57.470
We are who we are.

02:25.531 --> 02:27.667
Stop! Stop this. Just stop.

02:57.830 --> 02:58.865
No!

03:08.574 --> 03:09.742
<i>If he comes for me...</i>

03:13.046 --> 03:14.580
<i>I won't fight him.</i>

03:17.984 --> 03:20.520
<i>He's the closest thing
I have to a brother.</i>

03:37.237 --> 03:38.538
Save yourself.

03:42.542 --> 03:43.843
Beckman!

03:43.876 --> 03:45.745
We know you're in there!

03:45.778 --> 03:46.980
Come on, get it open!

03:48.081 --> 03:49.649
Come on, hurry up!

03:49.682 --> 03:51.784
Come on, spread out!

03:51.818 --> 03:54.554
Watch the body!

03:58.591 --> 04:00.493
<i>I need to get out.</i>

04:02.095 --> 04:03.663
<i>There's got be a way out.</i>

04:05.665 --> 04:07.967
This is the life
you chose, Beckman.

04:09.736 --> 04:12.605
There's no way out,
no retirement plan,

04:12.638 --> 04:15.608
no pearly gates. Accept it.

04:33.860 --> 04:35.895
I don't know what to do,
Lord, I...

04:37.331 --> 04:38.631
Guide me.

04:40.933 --> 04:41.934
I have to choose.

04:43.970 --> 04:45.104
Medicine or the church.

04:47.106 --> 04:49.142
It won't be long before it's...

04:50.344 --> 04:52.812
my medicine or my home.

04:54.214 --> 04:55.915
Please guide me.

05:08.094 --> 05:09.363
I need help.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.097
God! What happened?

05:12.665 --> 05:14.133
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No, don't!

05:14.168 --> 05:15.601
Please.

05:15.635 --> 05:18.838
A donation. 350,000.

05:18.871 --> 05:20.106
It's yours.

05:22.008 --> 05:23.042
I need help.

05:24.378 --> 05:26.579
This is a house of God.

05:28.981 --> 05:29.949
I know.

05:54.408 --> 05:56.676
I believe this
is from you, Lord.

06:17.164 --> 06:19.832
"As far as the
east is from the west,

06:19.866 --> 06:24.003
so far does he remove
our transgressions from us."

06:24.036 --> 06:26.072
We've been over this before.
I've got it.

06:26.105 --> 06:27.207
Do you?

06:28.175 --> 06:29.142
Why'd you take me in?

06:30.743 --> 06:32.179
If it wasn't for the money?

06:33.946 --> 06:35.681
I have my personal reasons.

06:37.817 --> 06:40.052
That's between me and God.

06:42.989 --> 06:46.160
I'm here.
I want to believe, I...

06:46.193 --> 06:47.194
You're not ready.

06:49.061 --> 06:50.663
You have to let go.

06:51.465 --> 06:53.733
Allow the Almighty
to control your life.

06:54.967 --> 06:56.836
That person you were before...

06:58.137 --> 07:00.006
that person has to die.

07:00.039 --> 07:02.476
And are you ready
to let it all go?

07:02.509 --> 07:04.178
All the people you harmed?

07:05.345 --> 07:07.214
Be honest.

07:10.850 --> 07:13.220
Father, forgive me.

07:16.122 --> 07:17.224
God forgive me.

08:08.074 --> 08:09.276
In the jungle...

08:10.943 --> 08:13.145
15 miles west of Khe Sanh,

08:14.181 --> 08:15.982
I killed 11 men.

08:18.385 --> 08:19.353
Boys.

08:21.555 --> 08:23.523
They never stood
a chance. They...

08:23.557 --> 08:26.025
They gave me a medal
for that.

08:27.561 --> 08:31.864
When it was my time
to go home, I... I stayed.

08:31.897 --> 08:34.100
I don't know why.

08:34.133 --> 08:37.069
Maybe somehow I thought
I could make things right.

08:38.037 --> 08:41.408
I was lost, completely lost.

08:41.441 --> 08:44.578
That's when God finds us.

08:44.611 --> 08:48.080
When the lies, denial...

08:49.416 --> 08:50.950
ego is gone.

08:52.386 --> 08:56.156
And there's nothing left
between you and your creator.

08:59.459 --> 09:00.926
Remember
what you've learned.

09:04.197 --> 09:05.131
<i>Promise me.</i>

09:08.368 --> 09:09.336
I promise.

09:47.507 --> 09:49.075
Death.

09:49.108 --> 09:51.411
That's what it took
to get through to Pharaoh.

09:52.412 --> 09:56.216
The death of his infant son.

09:57.149 --> 09:59.085
So he let Moses
and his people go.

09:59.118 --> 10:02.189
But then his grief
turned to anger.

10:03.557 --> 10:05.991
And he sent the chariots
after Moses.

10:11.298 --> 10:13.999
But when God saw that
his people were safe, he...

10:14.934 --> 10:18.104
drowned the entire
Egyptian army.

10:18.137 --> 10:21.408
An army couldn't deter
God's will.

10:21.441 --> 10:24.478
An army couldn't
stand against...

10:26.413 --> 10:27.381
God's might.

10:29.982 --> 10:32.352
So what makes you think
you can?

10:33.286 --> 10:35.188
You can't fool God.

10:35.988 --> 10:37.391
He knows who you are.

10:38.558 --> 10:41.194
He knows what you've done.

10:43.697 --> 10:45.399
He knows.

10:50.303 --> 10:51.405
That's it for today.

11:04.217 --> 11:06.952
Reverend.
You going somewhere?

11:06.986 --> 11:08.422
Sorry, Abby. I...

11:09.723 --> 11:11.158
I don't...

11:11.191 --> 11:14.059
I'm not fooling anyone.
I don't belong here.

11:15.127 --> 11:17.029
I don't know
what I was thinking.

11:17.062 --> 11:18.964
You're having a bad spell.

11:18.998 --> 11:21.133
- We've been through this.
- Philip was wrong.

11:21.168 --> 11:25.070
I don't deserve forgiveness.
I'm not worthy of it.

11:25.572 --> 11:27.139
The dreams are back.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.209
They never stopped.

11:31.511 --> 11:33.280
They're always there.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.248
Staring at me.

11:37.484 --> 11:39.352
The people you wronged?

11:40.754 --> 11:42.389
- Reverend.
- Philip was the reverend.

11:43.457 --> 11:45.592
Do you trust me,

11:45.625 --> 11:48.195
that I know
what I'm talking about?

11:48.228 --> 11:50.330
I have known
my share of men.

11:51.398 --> 11:53.366
Kind, evil,
everything in between.

11:53.400 --> 11:57.270
You are a good man
and a good preacher.

11:57.771 --> 11:59.573
Just hang on.

12:14.554 --> 12:16.156
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:21.795 --> 12:23.396
Uncle Philip, I'm sorry.

12:24.531 --> 12:28.201
I know I'm not supposed
to come here, but I need help.

12:28.235 --> 12:30.804
And I... And I am
in really big trouble.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.639
Okay. Okay.
Slow down. Slow down.

12:32.672 --> 12:34.374
I'm... I'm not Philip.

12:37.277 --> 12:39.111
Am I in the right place?

13:00.433 --> 13:03.436
Your uncle died
almost a year ago.

13:03.470 --> 13:06.138
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stay with me, stay with me.

13:09.442 --> 13:12.111
Well, what's...
What's your name?

13:12.846 --> 13:14.347
Tabitha.

13:14.381 --> 13:17.484
Well, welcome.
What kind of trouble are you in?

13:19.286 --> 13:21.154
I don't wanna talk
about that.

13:21.187 --> 13:24.457
I... I don't ever
wanna talk about it.

13:26.660 --> 13:28.595
Philip said that
if I needed help,

13:28.628 --> 13:30.196
that I could come here.

13:30.630 --> 13:31.398
I...

13:34.167 --> 13:36.336
I can drive you
to the emergency room.

13:40.340 --> 13:41.608
Forget it.

13:44.711 --> 13:46.313
Wait.

13:51.151 --> 13:52.252
Just wait.

14:04.364 --> 14:07.867
So Peter got out of the boat,
and he walked on the water.

14:07.901 --> 14:10.737
He saw the winds approaching,

14:10.770 --> 14:12.606
and he became afraid.

14:12.639 --> 14:15.609
And he took his eyes off of
Jesus, and he began to sink.

14:15.642 --> 14:19.746
And he cried out to the Lord,
saying, "Lord, save me!"

14:19.779 --> 14:22.147
And Jesus reached out his hand.

14:23.283 --> 14:25.752
When life is a tumultuous storm,

14:25.785 --> 14:29.356
look to him
and keep looking to him.

14:29.389 --> 14:33.493
And now our very own
adopted daughter Tabitha

14:33.526 --> 14:35.428
wants to inspire us
with something

14:35.462 --> 14:37.263
she's been working very hard on.

14:37.297 --> 14:39.165
Let's give her a hand.

15:03.456 --> 15:10.230
<i>♪ Rock of Ages, cleft for me ♪</i>

15:10.263 --> 15:14.567
<i>♪ Let me hide myself in thee ♪</i>

15:14.601 --> 15:20.974
<i>♪ Let the water
And the blood ♪</i>

15:21.007 --> 15:25.812
<i>♪ From the wounded side
That flows ♪</i>

15:25.845 --> 15:31.951
<i>♪ Be of sin the double cure ♪</i>

15:31.985 --> 15:39.192
<i>♪ Save from wrath
And make me pure ♪</i>

15:41.995 --> 15:43.596
Thanks, Bobby. Appreciate it.

15:43.630 --> 15:45.765
Hey, thank you very much.
Thank you.

15:45.799 --> 15:47.367
Oh, thank you.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.969
Tom. Hey.

15:50.003 --> 15:52.305
- Hey.
- Hey, how's your grandmother? I...

15:52.338 --> 15:55.442
Does she need anything?
I haven't been over there in a few weeks.

15:55.475 --> 15:58.578
Oh, no, she actually moved to
assisted living, in Valencia.

15:58.611 --> 16:01.514
Oh. Well, you got
the whole place to yourself.

16:01.548 --> 16:04.451
- Yeah.
- Can you afford that? Is it okay?

16:05.485 --> 16:06.886
Yeah,
I'm doing all right.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.955
- Good.
- Yeah.

16:08.988 --> 16:10.990
It was a really good
sermon today.

16:11.024 --> 16:12.859
They've been
really good lately.

16:12.892 --> 16:14.861
- Really? Lately?
- Yeah.

16:14.894 --> 16:16.830
What's this about?

16:17.997 --> 16:20.867
Oh, this?
Oh, just a rough night.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.335
I really wasn't
paying attention.

16:22.368 --> 16:24.003
Nice job, Reverend.

16:24.037 --> 16:26.673
Ah. You too, chipmunk.
Proud of you.

16:28.374 --> 16:30.376
Wow. Hope you gave
as good as you got.

16:31.511 --> 16:33.847
Oh, no. It wasn't like that.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.381
What was it like?

16:38.718 --> 16:40.019
I... I don't know.

16:40.053 --> 16:43.022
Ah... Hey, but I...
I gotta go.

16:43.056 --> 16:44.657
Hey, wait.
How'd that video turn out?

16:45.525 --> 16:46.960
Oh.

16:46.993 --> 16:49.729
Um... Yeah, yeah.
It turned out really good.

16:49.763 --> 16:51.798
Um... You're really talented.

16:51.831 --> 16:53.533
You... You wanna see?

16:54.567 --> 16:55.802
Here...

16:57.570 --> 16:58.872
is my number.

16:58.905 --> 17:00.673
Send it to me.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.842
Okay. Thanks.

17:03.843 --> 17:05.779
Listen, I really gotta go.

17:05.812 --> 17:07.080
I'll see you next week.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.615
All right. Bye.

17:12.519 --> 17:15.588
Don't tease him.
You know he likes you.

17:15.622 --> 17:17.791
I'm not gonna ask him out.
Those are the rules.

17:17.824 --> 17:19.793
Oh.

17:29.702 --> 17:31.371
What's wrong?

17:33.072 --> 17:34.374
Nothing.

17:35.809 --> 17:37.278
Nothing's wrong.

17:39.712 --> 17:40.847
Nothing's wrong.

17:43.750 --> 17:44.684
Nothing's wrong.

18:34.033 --> 18:36.369
Hands! Show me your hands!

18:50.217 --> 18:51.784
All right.

18:53.753 --> 18:55.388
Uh-huh.

18:56.055 --> 18:59.025
- Pizza!
- Ooh, yay!

18:59.058 --> 19:02.196
Did I tell you
how proud I am of you?

19:02.229 --> 19:05.565
Only, like, 20 times.

19:05.598 --> 19:07.500
Okay.

19:07.533 --> 19:09.569
Tell us something about yourself
that would shock us

19:09.602 --> 19:11.771
or move back four spaces.

19:11.804 --> 19:15.642
Mmm. We do not have
that kind of time.

19:15.675 --> 19:19.145
- Miss Abigail!
- Don't you know who you're talking to?

19:19.179 --> 19:21.514
I was a singer
in the '70s.

19:21.547 --> 19:23.917
I toured with all the greats.

19:23.950 --> 19:25.118
I was hot stuff.

19:25.152 --> 19:27.787
Waist like this,
skirts up to here.

19:27.820 --> 19:29.522
Oh, forgive me, Lord.

19:29.555 --> 19:31.658
You know, they
called me Baby Thunder.

19:31.691 --> 19:34.694
Oh, whoa! Too much information!
Too much!

19:35.728 --> 19:36.930
Oh.

19:38.031 --> 19:40.200
- Huh.
- Wait, is that...

19:40.234 --> 19:42.869
It's got some weight to it.
Might be the one.

19:44.771 --> 19:45.805
Okay, open it.

19:45.838 --> 19:47.573
No, don't open it.

19:49.276 --> 19:50.877
Just do it.

20:00.254 --> 20:02.555
Hey! What is this?

20:27.181 --> 20:29.582
There you are,
my little dreamer.

20:30.116 --> 20:31.784
I missed you.

20:32.618 --> 20:35.021
You were the most loved.

20:35.054 --> 20:38.192
- Above all the others.
- Get out of here right now!

20:38.225 --> 20:40.026
- Hey, back up!
- I'm sorry. I didn't know!

20:41.195 --> 20:43.496
You tore out my heart
when you left.

20:45.098 --> 20:47.967
But I knew the universe
would bring you back.

20:51.637 --> 20:53.506
We're bound, you and I.

20:54.274 --> 20:55.942
Don't touch me.

20:58.312 --> 21:02.749
You're confused.
You're in pain. I see that.

21:02.782 --> 21:04.650
I taught you what freedom
was, true freedom.

21:04.684 --> 21:09.022
And it scared you.
That's natural.

21:09.055 --> 21:10.823
I thought you were ready,

21:10.857 --> 21:13.760
but I pushed you
too hard, too fast.

21:13.793 --> 21:16.696
The unprepared mind
will do anything

21:16.729 --> 21:18.765
to come back to this prison,

21:18.798 --> 21:22.769
with its rules and comforts.

21:22.802 --> 21:24.937
- That's enough. Don't say one more word!
- Don't try me.

21:30.377 --> 21:32.145
Do you remember that night?

21:33.679 --> 21:36.149
When all was in balance.

21:39.219 --> 21:41.087
Underneath all those stars.

21:43.390 --> 21:45.758
You pledged yourself to me.

21:47.161 --> 21:50.063
The ritual night
is upon us again.

21:50.096 --> 21:56.102
I pledged to be your guide,
and I will, my child.

21:56.135 --> 21:58.704
We must finish
what we started.

21:58.738 --> 22:00.207
She's not going with you.

22:00.240 --> 22:03.243
I don't care
how many guns you have.

22:03.277 --> 22:06.579
You will do nothing but offer
poisoned words to enslaved minds.

22:07.914 --> 22:09.082
Shame on you.

22:09.115 --> 22:10.716
Tabitha, no.

22:11.251 --> 22:13.220
It's time to go.

22:13.253 --> 22:17.090
- No, no.
- You are in God's house!

22:17.123 --> 22:18.991
You leave that child alone.

22:21.094 --> 22:23.096
No!

22:23.129 --> 22:26.099
What, preacher, what?
What are you gonna do?

22:31.271 --> 22:33.639
If you make me
drag you out of here,

22:33.673 --> 22:36.075
it'll be so much worse.

22:37.110 --> 22:38.044
Come.

22:40.813 --> 22:41.948
Come.

22:51.158 --> 22:52.625
We're done here.

22:55.728 --> 22:57.431
- Let me go!
- Don't give me any trouble.

22:57.464 --> 22:58.764
Tabitha?

22:59.899 --> 23:01.168
Tabitha?

23:03.002 --> 23:03.970
Tabitha!

23:05.239 --> 23:07.039
You won't get away with this!

23:11.345 --> 23:13.779
I'm calling about Abigail.

23:21.221 --> 23:23.257
No, I'll... I'll tell them.

23:26.293 --> 23:29.061
Yes. Send it to me.

23:32.199 --> 23:33.833
I'll pay for the funeral.

23:35.235 --> 23:36.936
I'm so sorry.

23:37.337 --> 23:38.671
I'm sorry.

23:41.874 --> 23:42.842
Talk.

23:44.344 --> 23:45.912
I'm so sorry.

23:50.317 --> 23:51.817
Abigail's dead.

23:54.321 --> 23:55.289
What?

23:56.290 --> 23:57.224
Who were they?

23:58.791 --> 24:01.694
No, no, no.

24:02.296 --> 24:04.164
Who were they?

24:04.198 --> 24:05.965
- Talk.
- It's Erik!

24:07.501 --> 24:10.136
I...
He was the one who hit her.

24:10.170 --> 24:12.805
Look, I just met him
at work last month.

24:13.806 --> 24:15.708
We started talking.

24:17.043 --> 24:20.380
I just needed some rent.
I just drove a truck.

24:20.414 --> 24:23.749
I didn't ask...
I didn't ask what for.

24:23.783 --> 24:27.753
So I just asked him
for some advice about girls.

24:29.088 --> 24:31.258
You know, I showed him
the video of Tabitha.

24:32.459 --> 24:33.793
I guess he knew her.

24:36.796 --> 24:39.098
And they threw me in the truck.
I don't know.

24:39.131 --> 24:40.400
- What else?
- What?

24:40.434 --> 24:42.835
What else?
What else do you know?

24:42.868 --> 24:44.404
Nothing. I don't...

24:44.438 --> 24:48.741
He just... He had
a tattoo on his arm.

24:49.075 --> 24:50.009
A spider.

24:51.478 --> 24:54.847
I'm sorry!

25:15.569 --> 25:18.272
<i>Mr. Beckman.</i>

25:18.305 --> 25:22.376
<i>Welcome back. Or should I
call you "reverend" now?</i>

25:22.409 --> 25:24.043
Just Beckman.

25:24.076 --> 25:25.878
<i>As you wish.</i>

25:25.911 --> 25:27.847
<i>What can we do for you?</i>

25:29.182 --> 25:30.816
I need an address.

25:31.851 --> 25:33.287
And weapons.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.854
<i>Mr. Beckman,</i>

25:34.887 --> 25:37.157
<i>you remember the rules,
the price?</i>

25:39.559 --> 25:41.295
I'll pay it.

25:41.328 --> 25:42.828
<i>Very well.</i>

25:42.862 --> 25:44.331
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

25:45.898 --> 25:47.967
His name is Erik.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.838
Five foot ten,
black hair, spider tattoo.

25:56.610 --> 25:57.877
Hands!

25:58.545 --> 25:59.945
Show me your hands!

26:05.218 --> 26:06.386
Hands.

26:09.955 --> 26:11.358
Where is Erik?

26:12.659 --> 26:14.194
Where's Erik?

26:16.996 --> 26:18.165
You.

26:18.632 --> 26:20.200
Where is she?

26:20.233 --> 26:22.935
Man, you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

26:28.642 --> 26:30.377
Go back home
before you get hurt.

26:33.647 --> 26:35.014
Last chance.

26:36.483 --> 26:39.152
Where is she?

27:59.433 --> 28:00.333
Help.

28:02.235 --> 28:03.503
Help me.

28:26.760 --> 28:29.496
<i>911,
what's the nature of your emergency?</i>

28:30.397 --> 28:31.364
<i>Hello?</i>

28:32.632 --> 28:35.100
<i>Hello, is anyone there?</i>

28:36.369 --> 28:39.104
<i>Okay, I have your location.
I'm sending out a unit.</i>

29:05.298 --> 29:08.802
<i>You've reached a number</i>

29:08.835 --> 29:11.070
<i>that has been disconnected
or no longer...</i>

29:16.543 --> 29:17.811
<i>Hello?</i>

29:17.844 --> 29:19.144
Listen to me.

29:20.580 --> 29:22.682
I think we were followed.

29:22.716 --> 29:25.519
We need to move Tabitha
right away.

29:25.552 --> 29:27.687
- Where is she?
- <i>What?</i>

29:27.721 --> 29:31.391
<i>I haven't seen her in over a year.
I'm sleeping.</i>

29:31.424 --> 29:32.559
Who is this?

29:55.582 --> 29:56.316
My love.

29:58.218 --> 30:01.555
I'm sorry,
but he said it's urgent.

30:01.588 --> 30:03.223
Something about Tabitha?

30:05.458 --> 30:07.827
All your life
the world insists

30:07.861 --> 30:11.531
you punish yourself
for being inconvenient.

30:12.832 --> 30:16.670
You never need
to apologize to me.

30:17.370 --> 30:18.338
Okay.

30:26.212 --> 30:29.649
Erik, I hope you have some idea
how disruptive this phone call is.

30:33.253 --> 30:36.088
Erik won't be having
any more ideas.

30:38.491 --> 30:39.859
The preacher.

30:39.893 --> 30:41.328
Pay close attention.

30:42.662 --> 30:45.130
My name is Aaron Beckman.

30:45.165 --> 30:46.733
You ask around about me.

30:46.766 --> 30:48.868
And when you find out who I am,

30:48.902 --> 30:51.504
<i>you're gonna
let Tabitha go unharmed.</i>

30:53.239 --> 30:56.343
It's your only chance
to survive what's coming.

30:56.376 --> 30:59.212
Your actions, your threats,
they mean nothing to me.

30:59.245 --> 31:02.616
My future will be
as it was revealed to me.

31:02.649 --> 31:04.851
As it always has been.

31:04.884 --> 31:06.586
Solid like iron.

31:08.188 --> 31:09.656
Unchanging.

31:10.824 --> 31:13.493
<i>You will fail.</i>

31:13.526 --> 31:17.230
You always fail.

31:17.263 --> 31:20.300
Let her go, now.

31:21.668 --> 31:23.336
It's impossible.

31:23.370 --> 31:27.173
<i>That one's journey has ended
as it was meant to.</i>

31:27.207 --> 31:30.243
The desert drank her water.

31:31.711 --> 31:34.447
And she has returned
to the void.

31:39.819 --> 31:41.488
I'll see you soon.

32:03.476 --> 32:06.279
- <i>No, I can't.</i>
- <i>Just hang on.</i>

32:06.312 --> 32:08.815
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

32:08.848 --> 32:10.850
I can't do it.

32:10.884 --> 32:13.219
You can do it.

32:14.988 --> 32:17.724
Just a few more hours.
Hang on. You can do it.

32:21.027 --> 32:23.797
Help!

32:25.031 --> 32:26.599
<i>Reverend?</i>

32:28.868 --> 32:30.737
I think
I'm feeling better.

32:32.739 --> 32:36.209
Do you think I could
get some breakfast?

32:41.014 --> 32:43.683
Sure. Yeah, come on in.

32:49.556 --> 32:51.558
I... Yeah, here.

32:57.397 --> 32:59.532
How... How do you like
your eggs?

33:00.533 --> 33:01.801
I don't care.

33:15.348 --> 33:17.517
Why are you doing this for me?

33:20.854 --> 33:22.756
<i>Why'd you take me in?</i>

33:22.789 --> 33:24.958
<i>I had my personal reasons.</i>

33:24.991 --> 33:26.860
<i>That's between me and God.</i>

33:26.893 --> 33:28.461
<i>And open.</i>

33:29.896 --> 33:33.767
Oh! Is that mine?

33:33.800 --> 33:36.669
- As soon as you pass the test.
- I love it.

33:36.703 --> 33:40.774
- How'd you afford this?
- Well, you earned it.

33:40.807 --> 33:42.342
We're very proud of you.

33:42.375 --> 33:44.544
Uh, I got something else.

33:48.515 --> 33:51.851
It's not exactly the one
that you wanted, but close.

33:51.885 --> 33:55.955
No, it... it's great.
It's really great. Thank you.

33:55.989 --> 34:00.326
And not brand-new,
but it's yours.

34:06.366 --> 34:09.369
I can... I can pay you back.

34:10.770 --> 34:13.840
No, no, you don't...
you don't have to pay me back.

34:15.008 --> 34:17.677
Nothing...
Nothing's ever free.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.815
I don't mean to be ungrateful.
It's just...

34:21.848 --> 34:24.517
No, it's okay. I get it.

34:24.551 --> 34:26.920
This is new for both of us.

34:26.953 --> 34:28.454
You being a daughter...

34:29.589 --> 34:30.557
me a dad.

34:30.590 --> 34:33.393
- It's weird, right?
- Yeah.

34:33.426 --> 34:36.329
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing.

34:38.998 --> 34:40.733
But I promise you...

34:43.469 --> 34:46.806
I'll never, never hurt you.

34:47.874 --> 34:49.709
And I'll always protect you.

34:51.744 --> 34:54.380
I've heard that before,
you know.

34:54.414 --> 34:57.851
And I...
I wanna believe you.

34:57.884 --> 34:59.953
I just... I need time.

35:11.064 --> 35:15.735
"Dear Tabitha, it's been my great honor to
inform you that you've been acc... accepted.

35:18.172 --> 35:19.472
Admission..."

35:30.450 --> 35:34.654
<i>Mr. Beckman.
Were you satisfied with your service?</i>

35:35.488 --> 35:37.557
- Yes.
- <i>Excellent.</i>

35:37.590 --> 35:39.893
<i>You now have one week
to repay your debt</i>

35:39.926 --> 35:41.161
<i>to The Network.</i>

35:41.195 --> 35:42.829
<i>Keep the phone charged.</i>

35:42.862 --> 35:46.933
<i>When it rings, answer
and do exactly as instructed.</i>

35:46.966 --> 35:48.935
I know.

35:48.968 --> 35:51.471
<i>Is there any other service
we could provide...</i>

35:51.504 --> 35:54.440
No. No, nothing at all.

36:13.092 --> 36:14.894
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, sir.

36:16.095 --> 36:17.830
I'm Fred Shapiro
with the post office.

36:22.735 --> 36:24.504
You have a package here
that was damaged.

36:24.537 --> 36:26.572
The only thing I can read
is a phone number.

36:27.241 --> 36:30.177
Uh, address starts
with a 2-6.

36:30.210 --> 36:31.744
<i>Oh, no, it's 1-9.</i>

36:31.778 --> 36:33.546
Oh, wow. Yeah.
Not even close.

36:33.579 --> 36:37.884
Yeah, if you can give me the correct address,
we'll have this out to you tomorrow morning.

36:37.917 --> 36:42.922
<i>Uh... Oh, sure. It's 1975 Comstock
Drive, Glendora, 91741.</i>

36:44.991 --> 36:48.061
<i>Hey, I'm not expecting
a package. Who's it from?</i>

36:48.094 --> 36:50.663
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

36:52.299 --> 36:54.467
Hello? Do I know you?

36:55.768 --> 36:56.736
Inside.

36:58.104 --> 36:58.838
Okay.

37:02.276 --> 37:04.510
You... You can take
whatever you want.

37:04.544 --> 37:06.679
We got money.
There's a safe.

37:07.314 --> 37:09.682
- Who else is here?
- No one.

37:09.716 --> 37:12.018
Is someone at the door?

37:15.054 --> 37:16.022
Call her.

37:18.658 --> 37:20.994
Honey, will you come out
to the front room by the door?

37:21.027 --> 37:22.729
One sec.

37:23.629 --> 37:26.599
Janice, where's my shovel?

37:29.169 --> 37:30.770
Who else is here?

37:30.803 --> 37:32.872
It's my brother-in-law Kirk.

37:32.905 --> 37:34.841
- Sit down.
- Okay.

37:42.316 --> 37:44.650
Janice, what is happening?

37:44.684 --> 37:47.620
It's a misunderstanding.
Just do what he says.

37:47.653 --> 37:50.023
Both of you, sit down.

37:50.056 --> 37:52.892
- Hands on the table.
- They're not involved in this.

37:52.925 --> 37:53.893
Sit!

37:58.865 --> 38:00.700
You think this
is the first time

38:00.733 --> 38:02.935
someone pointed a gun at me?

38:02.969 --> 38:03.936
Just sit.

38:11.311 --> 38:12.845
That doesn't belong to you.

38:13.913 --> 38:15.915
What? What is he talking about?
Who is he?

38:15.948 --> 38:17.850
Just shut up!

38:33.699 --> 38:36.170
- Is she dead?
- Don't tell him anything.

38:37.003 --> 38:38.071
I don't know.

38:38.104 --> 38:39.605
Where did you take her?

38:39.639 --> 38:42.242
I don't know where she is.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.143
What is happening?
What is going on?

38:44.178 --> 38:46.679
Where is she?

38:46.712 --> 38:50.083
I... don't... know.

38:50.116 --> 38:51.851
Raise your right hand.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.621
Raise your hand.

38:57.890 --> 38:58.858
Kirk.

39:01.395 --> 39:02.695
What?

39:05.232 --> 39:07.100
Don't run. Don't shout.

39:07.133 --> 39:09.203
- Sit down.
- Okay, okay.

39:10.370 --> 39:11.971
Mister, we have children.

39:12.972 --> 39:13.906
Please.

39:16.676 --> 39:17.877
Where is she?

39:17.910 --> 39:20.347
- You're insane.
- Where is she?

39:20.380 --> 39:21.981
I don't know.

39:22.014 --> 39:23.417
Raise your left hand.

39:23.450 --> 39:25.718
What?
No. No, no, no, no.

39:25.751 --> 39:27.753
No, no, no.
What is happening?

39:28.222 --> 39:29.722
Raise your hand.

39:30.224 --> 39:31.158
Okay.

39:33.993 --> 39:36.330
Reese took her. Frank drove them.
That's all I know.

39:36.363 --> 39:37.797
Where is this Reese?

39:37.830 --> 39:40.032
- I don't know!
- Then where is Frank?

39:41.268 --> 39:41.968
He'll kill me.

39:43.237 --> 39:45.138
Erik is dead
and his whole crew.

39:45.172 --> 39:47.907
Now, I'm here.

39:47.940 --> 39:50.977
There's only one way
you survive this.

40:18.472 --> 40:21.175
This has to be a mistake.

40:21.208 --> 40:22.141
Say something.

40:23.075 --> 40:25.044
Sweetie? Answer me!

40:26.346 --> 40:29.081
Look, can you just let me out?
I'm not a part of this.

40:29.115 --> 40:32.152
I don't even know what this is. I
promise, I won't say anything to anybody.

40:32.186 --> 40:34.221
Shut up!

40:40.960 --> 40:43.330
Mister, we have a 12-year-old son.
His name's Edward.

40:43.363 --> 40:48.100
He's at school right now, and I'm supposed
to pick him up. And... he's anxious.

40:49.236 --> 40:50.803
Tabitha was 17.

40:51.238 --> 40:52.472
My daughter.

40:52.506 --> 40:53.873
What?

40:53.906 --> 40:57.009
What have you gotten me into?
I'm your husband. I deserve to know!

40:57.043 --> 40:59.179
Shut up, Dan!
Will you just shut up?

40:59.845 --> 41:01.348
Janice, look out!

41:10.390 --> 41:12.124
Give me your...

42:34.441 --> 42:38.044
- <i>There's no way out.</i>
- <i>What's your name?</i>

42:38.077 --> 42:40.079
<i>Tabitha.
I am in really big trouble.</i>

42:40.112 --> 42:42.081
<i>Man, you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.</i>

42:42.114 --> 42:43.916
<i>Under all those stars.</i>

42:47.920 --> 42:50.056
Where is it?

42:50.089 --> 42:52.592
Hey. You don't wanna
be late your first day.

42:52.626 --> 42:55.094
My necklace, can you
help me find it? Please.

42:55.127 --> 42:56.962
Uh... Okay.

42:58.532 --> 43:01.100
- What about...
- No, no, my necklace.

43:02.169 --> 43:04.837
The blue one, right?
The one your mom gave you?

43:07.006 --> 43:08.608
I already
looked over there.

43:08.642 --> 43:09.975
Okay.

43:16.450 --> 43:20.119
Could you please just move?
Please, please, just move.

43:20.153 --> 43:22.489
- What?
- Please move. Please.

43:22.522 --> 43:24.990
Please, just get out of the way.
Get out of the way! Stop!

43:25.459 --> 43:26.393
Okay, okay.

43:28.127 --> 43:29.095
Hey.

43:33.300 --> 43:34.900
You wanna talk about it?

43:34.934 --> 43:38.037
- <i>Why'd you take me in?</i>
- <i>Why are you doing this for me?</i>

43:38.070 --> 43:41.174
I already told you, I don't
ever wanna talk about it.

43:41.208 --> 43:42.942
<i>We're bound, you and I.</i>

43:45.144 --> 43:47.947
When will this feeling go away?
I just wanna tear it out.

43:52.152 --> 43:54.187
- <i>We're done here.</i>
- <i>Let me go!</i>

43:54.221 --> 43:56.523
<i>Tabitha?
You won't get away with this!</i>

43:56.556 --> 44:00.193
<i>You always fail.</i>

44:43.770 --> 44:45.405
Don't make any noise.

44:46.773 --> 44:49.443
No one's gonna hear you
except for her.

44:49.476 --> 44:51.545
- Janice?
- I don't know her name.

44:53.246 --> 44:55.080
Sometimes her brother
comes down.

44:56.048 --> 44:58.050
But she's much worse.

45:00.454 --> 45:01.488
Hey.

45:06.660 --> 45:08.961
It took me two days.

45:09.596 --> 45:11.231
What's your name?

45:12.532 --> 45:14.167
Wendy.

45:14.634 --> 45:15.569
Beckman.

45:20.774 --> 45:22.074
Quiet.

45:42.696 --> 45:44.531
Frank is coming with Reese.

45:46.131 --> 45:48.602
He's instructed me to keep
you here and not kill you.

45:52.539 --> 45:55.308
He didn't say anything
about hurting you.

45:59.813 --> 46:01.548
I'm gonna hurt you now.

46:03.683 --> 46:05.017
For my husband.

46:06.118 --> 46:08.120
For my children!

46:10.089 --> 46:11.291
For my brother.

46:12.626 --> 46:15.762
He protected me.

46:15.795 --> 46:17.430
He was the only one
who knew me.

46:19.299 --> 46:20.600
Hey!

46:23.870 --> 46:26.038
Keys! Get the keys!

46:27.274 --> 46:28.140
I can't.

46:28.174 --> 46:30.109
I can't.

46:30.142 --> 46:32.178
I think I can get them.

46:39.486 --> 46:41.521
I'm gonna be there
when Reese takes you apart

46:42.455 --> 46:43.456
piece by piece.

46:45.124 --> 46:46.293
I'm gonna watch.

46:59.773 --> 47:01.474
Keys. Grab the keys.

47:02.375 --> 47:03.476
Keys.

47:16.590 --> 47:17.724
Is she dead?

47:17.757 --> 47:20.092
Get my handcuffs. Quick.

47:28.902 --> 47:30.737
- What now?
- Help her.

47:30.770 --> 47:32.505
Don't come up till I say.

48:21.755 --> 48:23.390
Come on, come on.

48:38.271 --> 48:40.173
Come on, come on.

48:42.776 --> 48:43.743
No.

48:48.314 --> 48:50.383
No!

49:02.462 --> 49:05.331
- What?
- <i>We are not enemies, Mr. Beckman.</i>

49:05.365 --> 49:08.201
I have no enemies.

49:09.436 --> 49:11.204
All I have is love to give.

49:12.572 --> 49:14.974
By fighting, all you've done
is deprive yourself

49:15.008 --> 49:17.644
of a very special journey.

49:18.912 --> 49:21.748
<i>The ritual night is upon us.</i>

49:21.781 --> 49:25.852
- My students have gathered to witness the true...
- Shut up.

49:25.885 --> 49:28.254
<i>Nothing's
gonna save you now.</i>

49:29.022 --> 49:32.225
Not words, not money, not guns.

49:32.792 --> 49:35.829
You are a dead man.

49:37.430 --> 49:39.532
All you care about
is the mortal flesh.

49:40.700 --> 49:43.737
Life is so much more
than this, Mr. Beckman.

49:43.770 --> 49:48.541
I only wish I could have
shown you my paradise.

49:49.809 --> 49:54.814
Very well. If death is all
you understand, all you value...

49:56.516 --> 49:58.818
then I will
rain it down upon you

49:59.919 --> 50:01.454
<i>and everyone around you.</i>

50:07.694 --> 50:09.362
Give it to me.

50:09.395 --> 50:11.631
You need to get out of town
until this is all sorted out.

50:11.664 --> 50:13.299
The ritual
will not be postponed.

50:13.333 --> 50:14.834
You're not listening!

50:14.868 --> 50:16.669
You can play
cult leader anywhere.

50:16.703 --> 50:20.073
Just get on your jet and go.
This guy is serious.

50:20.106 --> 50:23.476
He's a real psychopath.
I looked into it.

50:23.510 --> 50:25.345
The Koreans, you know
what they call him?

50:25.378 --> 50:27.480
<i>Agma.</i> The demon.

50:33.853 --> 50:35.522
You understand the price?

50:47.133 --> 50:49.536
It's all clear.
You can come up now.

50:56.843 --> 50:58.511
Mister, is she dead?

50:59.145 --> 51:00.580
Did I kill her?

51:01.848 --> 51:02.782
Keys.

51:08.855 --> 51:10.590
Give me five minutes.

51:10.623 --> 51:12.091
Then call 911.

51:12.125 --> 51:13.693
What do I tell them?

51:13.726 --> 51:15.528
The truth.

51:37.650 --> 51:40.420
<i>Tom's phone. Leave a message.</i>

51:40.453 --> 51:43.857
Tom! You have to
get out of the apartment.

51:43.890 --> 51:46.726
Go to a safe place, somewhere where
no one will think to find you.

51:46.759 --> 51:49.829
Don't answer the phone for anybody but me.

51:49.863 --> 51:51.497
I'm on my way.

52:20.126 --> 52:21.461
Tom?

52:24.898 --> 52:25.865
Tom?

53:17.850 --> 53:18.818
Connor.

53:19.886 --> 53:20.853
Isabel.

53:21.788 --> 53:22.889
Beckman.

53:31.831 --> 53:33.666
You don't
look so good, Beckman.

53:36.170 --> 53:38.771
Come on, man.
You think we're amateurs?

53:39.872 --> 53:41.275
What do you say?

53:41.308 --> 53:43.710
Love you, Papa Bear.

53:43.743 --> 53:45.478
Love you, Mama Bear.

53:48.948 --> 53:49.882
Clear.

53:52.219 --> 53:53.519
Hey, Beckman.

53:54.954 --> 53:59.293
Word is that you got out,
found religion.

53:59.326 --> 54:00.760
Not going so well, is it?

54:03.997 --> 54:05.498
Clear.

54:07.133 --> 54:09.002
It's good to see you, Aaron.

54:09.035 --> 54:10.636
Sorry it has to go like this.

54:10.670 --> 54:13.973
A hundred thousand will get us
out of a tight spot. Clear.

54:17.244 --> 54:18.578
Clear.

54:22.115 --> 54:23.049
Window.

54:34.294 --> 54:36.129
Isabel! Isabel!

54:37.930 --> 54:39.065
Isabel!

54:41.934 --> 54:42.869
Isabel!

54:47.106 --> 54:48.641
Isabel!

56:00.314 --> 56:01.848
Reverend?

56:06.420 --> 56:07.687
What's happening?

56:10.290 --> 56:11.991
Wait, Tom!

56:12.892 --> 56:14.026
Tom!

56:30.943 --> 56:31.911
Wait!

56:35.449 --> 56:37.717
Tom, stop!
You're in trouble.

56:38.318 --> 56:39.986
He was there to kill you.

56:40.019 --> 56:42.289
- What? Why? I didn't do anything!
- I know.

56:42.322 --> 56:43.890
Trust me on this.

56:43.923 --> 56:45.925
If you stay here,
you're dead.

56:59.406 --> 57:01.908
- It's all my fault.
- It's not your fault.

57:01.941 --> 57:04.244
None of this is your fault.

57:04.278 --> 57:07.247
Well, what if he was lying?
What if she's not dead?

57:07.281 --> 57:10.082
- She's gone.
- How do you know?

57:10.116 --> 57:13.085
I need you to focus.
Worry about your own skin.

57:13.119 --> 57:18.192
- Well, where are we going?
- There's this guy I know. Owes me a favor.

57:18.225 --> 57:21.827
You're not gonna like it, but it'll
keep you safe until I can fix this.

57:21.861 --> 57:23.297
How?

57:23.330 --> 57:26.065
Only way to erase a bounty is
to bury the man who posted it.

57:26.098 --> 57:28.968
Whoa, whoa. Okay, okay.
I can't... I can't hear that.

57:29.969 --> 57:31.238
You're talking about murder.

57:32.472 --> 57:34.441
Reverend, you shot that guy.

57:34.474 --> 57:36.876
- He knew the risk.
- What?

57:36.909 --> 57:39.346
You're a man of God.
You killed that guy.

57:39.379 --> 57:41.248
I didn't have a choice.

57:41.281 --> 57:42.949
<i>I got no choice!</i>

57:49.289 --> 57:51.757
- Please, we can go to the cops.
- The cops can't help.

57:51.791 --> 57:53.092
- Please.
- The cops can't help you.

57:53.125 --> 57:55.429
You're in it now.
Do you understand?

57:55.462 --> 57:56.862
You're marked.

57:56.896 --> 57:58.931
What am... What am I in?

58:05.572 --> 58:07.341
The life. The other world.

58:07.374 --> 58:09.108
The underworld.
You're in it now.

58:09.141 --> 58:13.913
Real killers, thieves,
darkness, evil.

58:14.914 --> 58:16.550
Listen.
You haven't spilled blood.

58:16.583 --> 58:18.185
You haven't taken money.

58:18.218 --> 58:23.156
You can still get out
if you do exactly what I say.

58:28.395 --> 58:30.830
What is it?
Who is that?

58:37.571 --> 58:39.406
They call him The Administrator.

58:39.439 --> 58:41.007
What does that mean?

58:41.040 --> 58:43.042
No one's lived long enough
to ask him.

58:43.510 --> 58:44.944
Oh, pshh.

58:47.046 --> 58:49.549
Okay, well, we can go to the police.
They'll protect us.

58:49.583 --> 58:50.916
It's not gonna happen.

58:53.287 --> 58:56.556
Okay, well, let's go, go, go!
We can lose him!

58:56.590 --> 58:58.891
Only idiots
get into car chases.

58:59.925 --> 59:01.595
- You work around here, right?
- Yeah.

59:01.628 --> 59:04.398
- The... The brewery up on Battery Street.
- Okay.

59:12.506 --> 59:13.906
- Where?
- To the right.

59:16.075 --> 59:18.044
Here. Unscrew the suppressor.

59:18.077 --> 59:21.147
- What? Is this loaded?
- This, unscrew it.

59:23.883 --> 59:26.085
- Where?
- It's up here on the right.

59:27.587 --> 59:29.456
- Get the keys?
- Yeah.

59:29.489 --> 59:31.191
When I say go,
you get out fast.

59:31.224 --> 59:32.958
Unlock the door.
I'll be right behind you.

59:38.130 --> 59:39.098
Go!

1:00:31.050 --> 1:00:33.320
Do not
disappoint me, Mr. Beckman.

1:00:36.055 --> 1:00:37.324
Do you have more ammo...

1:00:38.425 --> 1:00:40.193
or a second firearm?

1:00:43.630 --> 1:00:45.030
Very good.

1:00:45.064 --> 1:00:47.267
I've always hoped

1:00:47.300 --> 1:00:50.069
we'd have a chance
to test each other.

1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:44.049
You were injured
before we started.

1:02:44.083 --> 1:02:47.019
So this was not
a fair contest.

1:02:48.555 --> 1:02:50.156
Hard day.

1:02:58.765 --> 1:03:00.433
You were out.

1:03:01.568 --> 1:03:03.135
And now you're back

1:03:03.169 --> 1:03:06.138
with a considerable price
on your head.

1:03:06.172 --> 1:03:08.275
You must have a good reason.

1:03:08.308 --> 1:03:09.576
Yeah.

1:03:10.744 --> 1:03:14.146
Before I complete
every assignment,

1:03:14.180 --> 1:03:16.416
I ask this question.

1:03:16.449 --> 1:03:20.186
If I let you live,
what will you do?

1:03:22.322 --> 1:03:25.057
What will <i>you</i> do, Mr. Beckman?

1:03:28.828 --> 1:03:30.497
There were four of them.

1:03:31.398 --> 1:03:33.300
Traffickers.

1:03:33.333 --> 1:03:37.504
Came into my house,
killed my daughter.

1:03:39.272 --> 1:03:42.475
All she did was escape them.
That was her sin.

1:03:43.443 --> 1:03:47.614
She had just been
accepted to college.

1:03:49.749 --> 1:03:51.418
She was starting a life.

1:03:53.219 --> 1:03:56.489
There were four of them.
Now there's only two.

1:03:58.291 --> 1:04:02.629
I'm gonna finish what I started.
That's what I'm gonna do.

1:04:09.869 --> 1:04:13.173
I have killed 436 people...

1:04:14.741 --> 1:04:17.109
and I spared only four.

1:04:18.478 --> 1:04:21.181
I believe that
because of my actions,

1:04:21.214 --> 1:04:24.284
the world is a better place.

1:04:26.419 --> 1:04:27.387
You...

1:04:28.922 --> 1:04:31.191
will be number five.

1:04:33.226 --> 1:04:36.696
Mercy is a rare
and powerful tool.

1:04:37.664 --> 1:04:39.366
I believe

1:04:39.399 --> 1:04:42.869
the world will be a better place

1:04:42.902 --> 1:04:44.671
with you alive.

1:04:48.274 --> 1:04:50.176
But if I see your name

1:04:50.210 --> 1:04:52.144
on the boards again,
Mr. Beckman,

1:04:52.812 --> 1:04:54.614
you will have no mercy.

1:04:56.383 --> 1:04:59.152
You will not
even see me coming.

1:05:26.513 --> 1:05:29.449
Favors, all these favors.

1:05:29.482 --> 1:05:32.552
I'm running
a business here, Beckman.

1:05:32.585 --> 1:05:36.523
- You're positive no one followed you here?
- No one followed me.

1:05:36.556 --> 1:05:39.826
Yeah, every two-bit banger
with a gun is gonna be

1:05:39.859 --> 1:05:41.761
after that hundred grand.

1:05:41.795 --> 1:05:44.531
I'm tempted to shoot you myself.

1:05:44.564 --> 1:05:48.835
And I don't need the money.
You know that, right?

1:05:48.868 --> 1:05:51.805
I run all this on favors.

1:05:51.838 --> 1:05:55.375
No, no. Just kidding here.

1:05:55.408 --> 1:05:57.644
- What is this?
- Huh?

1:05:58.378 --> 1:05:59.746
- What?
- What is this?

1:05:59.779 --> 1:06:02.382
What is this? Oh, sweet.

1:06:02.415 --> 1:06:05.385
He don't know.

1:06:05.418 --> 1:06:07.587
Look, I just need you
to hold him for a few days.

1:06:07.620 --> 1:06:10.557
Days. You sure you want
days with this kid?

1:06:10.590 --> 1:06:12.759
Yeah, I'll give you
all the time in the world.

1:06:17.030 --> 1:06:19.733
What? This is a prison.

1:06:19.766 --> 1:06:23.603
You see? This is where you're
gonna spend the next five years.

1:06:23.636 --> 1:06:26.339
No, no, no.

1:06:26.372 --> 1:06:29.676
Look, do you wanna be safe
or you wanna be dead?

1:06:31.511 --> 1:06:35.548
No one's gonna bother you in
there, my guarantee.

1:06:47.527 --> 1:06:49.395
Wait.

1:06:52.365 --> 1:06:53.733
I just wanna say something.

1:06:54.968 --> 1:06:56.669
To him.

1:07:03.376 --> 1:07:05.578
Killing those men
isn't gonna bring her back.

1:07:07.614 --> 1:07:09.682
- Go to the cops.
- I can't go to the cops.

1:07:09.716 --> 1:07:11.785
- You can.
- Tom.

1:07:12.786 --> 1:07:13.720
This?

1:07:15.722 --> 1:07:16.756
This is because of you.

1:07:17.991 --> 1:07:19.893
This kid got in my face
at a party.

1:07:21.694 --> 1:07:23.463
I could have beat him.

1:07:24.998 --> 1:07:26.866
But I thought about
what you taught me.

1:07:26.900 --> 1:07:30.470
"Blessed are the meek,
blessed are the merciful."

1:07:31.704 --> 1:07:32.872
I just let him hit me.

1:07:32.906 --> 1:07:34.707
And he kept hitting me until...

1:07:36.442 --> 1:07:38.711
I don't know, he just
kinda got freaked out.

1:07:39.979 --> 1:07:41.981
But he came up to me later.

1:07:42.015 --> 1:07:44.584
He wanted to know
why I didn't fight back.

1:07:45.385 --> 1:07:46.920
So I told him.

1:07:48.454 --> 1:07:51.124
He told me he was sorry.

1:07:51.158 --> 1:07:53.459
He wanted to change
his whole life around.

1:07:55.495 --> 1:07:57.931
You helped that happen.

1:07:59.632 --> 1:08:01.968
When life is
a tumultuous storm...

1:08:02.001 --> 1:08:04.604
- I know what I said.
- So stop.

1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:08.608
Remember who you are.

1:08:12.179 --> 1:08:13.680
Reverend!

1:08:14.981 --> 1:08:15.882
Reverend!

1:08:18.985 --> 1:08:20.486
I need ammo. I'm out.

1:08:21.421 --> 1:08:23.857
Hey, look.
You know the rules.

1:08:23.890 --> 1:08:26.593
I stay completely neutral.

1:08:26.626 --> 1:08:28.661
This guy who wants
you dead so bad,

1:08:28.695 --> 1:08:31.464
you know how to get to him?

1:08:31.497 --> 1:08:34.701
- Not yet.
- You know my cousin's a broker downtown.

1:08:34.734 --> 1:08:38.805
Off The Network.
I could give you credit.

1:08:39.772 --> 1:08:42.775
No. I know who I need
to talk to.

1:08:49.849 --> 1:08:51.751
What?

1:08:51.784 --> 1:08:54.487
No. You got exactly
what you paid for.

1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:55.889
You hired me
to crack the firewall.

1:08:55.922 --> 1:08:58.591
"I will take care of the rest."
Your exact words.

1:08:59.993 --> 1:09:02.862
That's right, Mr. Kerrigan.
I record everything.

1:09:05.932 --> 1:09:09.535
I can't help that you're too
basic to get past the encryption.

1:09:11.104 --> 1:09:12.839
Oh, you wanna dance?
Let's dance.

1:09:12.872 --> 1:09:14.841
I've got your fingerprints,
I've got your DNA,

1:09:14.874 --> 1:09:16.542
I've got your socials,
pin numbers, transcripts.

1:09:16.576 --> 1:09:18.178
I will burn
your life down in minutes.

1:09:18.212 --> 1:09:20.413
You're just a tourist
in my world.

1:09:22.682 --> 1:09:23.616
Kara!

1:09:24.083 --> 1:09:25.885
I just wanna talk.

1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:27.854
Wait!

1:09:30.123 --> 1:09:31.424
Wait!

1:09:52.912 --> 1:09:55.249
I'm just passing through.

1:09:55.282 --> 1:10:00.019
- Whatever this is, I'm here for...
- Kara.

1:10:02.855 --> 1:10:04.791
Yeah.

1:10:04.824 --> 1:10:07.994
She's gonna pay us eight grand
to make sure you don't find her.

1:10:10.230 --> 1:10:12.465
You gotta be kidding me.

1:10:15.169 --> 1:10:17.470
I just wanna talk.

1:10:26.913 --> 1:10:28.915
Wait, that's the guy.

1:10:29.882 --> 1:10:32.018
I saw your picture
on the boards today.

1:10:32.051 --> 1:10:35.922
Boys, he's worth
a hundred grand.

1:10:37.191 --> 1:10:39.926
This is gonna be a good day.

1:10:39.959 --> 1:10:43.029
It's a good day.
Let's get to work.

1:11:24.637 --> 1:11:26.105
The drill. Get the drill!

1:11:26.139 --> 1:11:27.774
Yeah, yeah.

1:11:50.364 --> 1:11:52.366
Hey, man,
it's just business, huh?

1:11:52.399 --> 1:11:53.966
It's nothing personal.

1:12:03.042 --> 1:12:03.976
What?

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:07.580
Is he dead?

1:12:09.416 --> 1:12:11.185
Are you sure?

1:12:25.998 --> 1:12:26.966
Gun.

1:12:31.238 --> 1:12:33.739
I just wanna talk.

1:12:41.848 --> 1:12:45.385
Lane must have hired you.
That was a setup. I...

1:12:45.419 --> 1:12:47.019
I wasn't even there.

1:12:50.089 --> 1:12:52.758
I just need information.

1:12:54.361 --> 1:12:56.696
I wasn't even there.

1:12:56.729 --> 1:12:58.198
It's not about that.

1:13:02.336 --> 1:13:03.769
I don't wanna die.

1:13:03.803 --> 1:13:06.105
I'm not gonna shoot you.

1:13:08.175 --> 1:13:09.876
I don't believe you.

1:13:10.444 --> 1:13:12.044
It's what you do.

1:13:13.946 --> 1:13:14.914
It is.

1:13:22.456 --> 1:13:24.991
I was out for three years.

1:13:27.194 --> 1:13:28.828
Hayes was right.

1:13:29.429 --> 1:13:31.465
We are what we are.

1:13:31.498 --> 1:13:32.732
<i>Save yourself.</i>

1:13:32.765 --> 1:13:34.201
He was a good man.

1:13:36.203 --> 1:13:37.171
That was you?

1:13:45.479 --> 1:13:47.381
So how is it on the surface?

1:13:47.414 --> 1:13:48.915
It's beautiful.

1:13:50.016 --> 1:13:52.486
You're not afraid,
not trapped.

1:13:52.519 --> 1:13:56.223
You're just... free.

1:13:57.424 --> 1:13:59.859
Free to believe.

1:14:01.361 --> 1:14:02.962
Care about someone.

1:14:04.364 --> 1:14:05.299
Must be nice.

1:14:06.366 --> 1:14:08.235
I had a daughter.

1:14:09.236 --> 1:14:10.970
They killed her.

1:14:11.837 --> 1:14:13.307
She was just 17.

1:14:17.143 --> 1:14:18.811
You would've liked her.

1:14:20.514 --> 1:14:23.883
For old times,
do me this one favor.

1:14:27.887 --> 1:14:29.855
Two more men need to die.

1:14:33.393 --> 1:14:34.994
They're the last.

1:14:37.264 --> 1:14:38.165
After that...

1:14:46.406 --> 1:14:48.007
What was her name?

1:14:57.551 --> 1:14:59.519
<i>"Blessed are the merciful.</i>

1:14:59.553 --> 1:15:01.255
<i>Blessed are the peacekeepers."</i>

1:15:01.288 --> 1:15:03.457
<i>Are you ready to let it all go?</i>

1:15:03.490 --> 1:15:06.058
<i>Why are you doing this for me?</i>

1:15:06.092 --> 1:15:07.361
<i>Remember what you've learned.</i>

1:15:07.394 --> 1:15:09.229
Hey.

1:15:09.263 --> 1:15:10.830
Come on up.

1:15:11.565 --> 1:15:15.034
- You found them?
- Bad news first.

1:15:15.067 --> 1:15:16.769
Your boogeyman,
Reese Saladurus.

1:15:17.504 --> 1:15:19.539
Real name
Paul Robert Kettle III,

1:15:19.573 --> 1:15:21.375
heir to his daddy's
telecom fortune.

1:15:21.408 --> 1:15:23.543
He is worth billions.

1:15:23.577 --> 1:15:26.145
He was kicked out
of Dartmouth in '86.

1:15:26.179 --> 1:15:28.548
Reason redacted.
Police records redacted.

1:15:28.582 --> 1:15:30.417
He spent a few years
in the psych wards.

1:15:30.450 --> 1:15:32.352
Hospital defunded.
Poof. He's gone.

1:15:35.622 --> 1:15:37.591
- Where is he now?
- I...

1:15:37.624 --> 1:15:40.193
Off the grid.
There's no permanent address.

1:15:40.227 --> 1:15:42.229
Look, all I know is that
he pops up every now and then,

1:15:42.262 --> 1:15:43.963
he rents houses for cash
in the desert.

1:15:43.996 --> 1:15:45.898
He's there for a few weeks
and he's gone.

1:15:45.931 --> 1:15:47.534
That's all I know.

1:15:47.567 --> 1:15:51.305
If you want any more,
use the black phone and take your chances.

1:15:54.341 --> 1:15:56.576
- Good news?
- Frank Keetus.

1:15:56.610 --> 1:15:59.579
Known trafficker
and all-around giant dirtbag.

1:15:59.613 --> 1:16:01.315
He owns a fancy restaurant
in Malibu,

1:16:01.348 --> 1:16:04.217
- but it's a front for the business.
- Which is what?

1:16:04.251 --> 1:16:05.485
You know what it is.

1:16:05.519 --> 1:16:08.255
You know I work with a lot of
hard-core, evil individuals,

1:16:08.288 --> 1:16:11.158
but I won't touch
anything like that.

1:16:12.559 --> 1:16:14.261
Do me a favor.

1:16:17.364 --> 1:16:18.898
Kill him twice.

1:16:44.257 --> 1:16:46.293
Sir, you can't
park your car there.

1:16:47.461 --> 1:16:48.428
Sir!

1:16:51.398 --> 1:16:53.200
You Beckman?

1:16:53.233 --> 1:16:55.868
Boss said to break your arms
if you try to get in.

1:16:56.570 --> 1:16:57.870
So?

1:16:58.705 --> 1:17:00.273
What do you wanna do?

1:17:01.006 --> 1:17:02.908
What do you wanna do?

1:17:14.721 --> 1:17:16.690
Hit end.

1:17:16.723 --> 1:17:18.023
Please.

1:17:19.326 --> 1:17:20.893
Take me to Frank.

1:17:21.428 --> 1:17:23.028
Leave the phone.

1:17:25.465 --> 1:17:28.402
I told you they would
be good this time, huh?

1:17:28.435 --> 1:17:29.436
The best yet.

1:17:40.614 --> 1:17:41.515
Who's this?

1:17:43.450 --> 1:17:46.219
Who are you to invite
yourself to our table?

1:17:46.253 --> 1:17:49.256
This is private meeting.
Go away.

1:17:50.357 --> 1:17:52.091
Meeting's over.

1:17:52.124 --> 1:17:54.561
Gentlemen,
my deepest apologies.

1:17:54.594 --> 1:17:57.164
You could follow Samara
to the bar, have a drink.

1:17:57.197 --> 1:18:01.100
In my business, I am the boss
and the complaint department.

1:18:01.133 --> 1:18:04.271
Nothing to worry about.
This will just take a few minutes.

1:18:04.304 --> 1:18:06.173
- Do you think I should call the...
- No!

1:18:06.206 --> 1:18:08.542
Don't call the cops.
How stupid are you?

1:18:16.550 --> 1:18:18.718
You don't look so hot,
preacher.

1:18:18.752 --> 1:18:21.288
Let's go in the back,
have a talk.

1:18:21.321 --> 1:18:23.457
- We could talk here.
- Get up.

1:18:25.525 --> 1:18:27.294
You're the guy with the gun.

1:19:00.125 --> 1:19:03.396
Oh, why don't we skip the part
where this shocks you.

1:19:04.397 --> 1:19:06.031
You're no civilian.

1:19:06.633 --> 1:19:08.635
I know exactly what you are.

1:19:08.668 --> 1:19:10.270
You know what I want.

1:19:10.303 --> 1:19:13.240
- Where is he?
- Polecat Ranch.

1:19:13.273 --> 1:19:15.542
About ten miles
north of Piru.

1:19:15.575 --> 1:19:19.579
He's there right now running
one of his crazy rituals.

1:19:19.613 --> 1:19:22.249
You'd give him up that easy?

1:19:22.282 --> 1:19:26.219
- I don't buy it.
- You're in my place with a gun to my head.

1:19:26.253 --> 1:19:28.154
How do I need
this aggravation, huh?

1:19:28.188 --> 1:19:31.224
Over one dead kid? Nah.

1:19:31.258 --> 1:19:33.793
You go up there, pop him in the head.
What do I care?

1:19:33.827 --> 1:19:36.162
He's crazy.
Money ain't worth this.

1:19:38.431 --> 1:19:40.500
You think this gets you
off the hook?

1:19:42.202 --> 1:19:43.570
You're part of it.

1:19:48.708 --> 1:19:50.377
You should probably answer that.

1:19:51.545 --> 1:19:52.479
Go on.

1:19:59.319 --> 1:20:02.489
- Beckman.
- <i>Good evening, Mr. Beckman.</i>

1:20:02.522 --> 1:20:06.259
<i>Are you prepared to fulfill
your debt to The Network?</i>

1:20:07.594 --> 1:20:10.230
- <i>Mr. Beckman?</i>
- Yes.

1:20:10.263 --> 1:20:13.366
<i>Excellent.
Listen carefully.</i>

1:20:13.400 --> 1:20:16.636
<i>The contract on your life
has been suspended.</i>

1:20:16.670 --> 1:20:20.473
<i>To fulfill your debt,
you are to cease any and all</i>

1:20:20.507 --> 1:20:23.443
<i>acts of retribution
towards Frank Keetus,</i>

1:20:23.476 --> 1:20:27.180
<i>his clients, employees
or known associates.</i>

1:20:27.213 --> 1:20:30.317
<i>Do you understand
what I've said?</i>

1:20:30.350 --> 1:20:34.588
<i>Mr. Beckman, are you there?
Would you like me to repeat it?</i>

1:20:34.621 --> 1:20:36.790
- I got it.
- <i>Good.</i>

1:20:36.823 --> 1:20:38.858
<i>Do I need to remind you
of the price</i>

1:20:38.892 --> 1:20:41.728
<i>of defying a Network order?</i>

1:20:41.761 --> 1:20:45.865
- No.
- <i>Then the book is closed on this transaction.</i>

1:20:45.899 --> 1:20:47.601
<i>We hope to serve you again.</i>

1:20:50.770 --> 1:20:52.739
You'll be lowering that gun now.

1:20:52.772 --> 1:20:53.707
Sit down.

1:20:56.276 --> 1:20:57.243
Hey.

1:20:58.178 --> 1:20:59.546
It's over.

1:21:01.381 --> 1:21:03.483
<i>Killing those men
isn't gonna bring her back.</i>

1:21:21.835 --> 1:21:23.470
Hey.

1:21:24.270 --> 1:21:25.338
Put the gun down.

1:21:27.907 --> 1:21:30.610
Hey, put the gun down.

1:21:37.951 --> 1:21:39.686
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

1:21:44.424 --> 1:21:46.660
<i>I'll always protect you.</i>

1:21:49.262 --> 1:21:51.331
Whoa. Hey, it's over!

1:21:54.267 --> 1:21:56.403
What do you want?

1:21:56.436 --> 1:21:58.338
You want me to say I'm sorry?

1:21:58.371 --> 1:22:01.207
I am sorry the world's rotten.

1:22:01.241 --> 1:22:03.943
A stinking open sewer.
Not my fault!

1:22:03.977 --> 1:22:06.813
I didn't invent this game.

1:22:06.846 --> 1:22:09.382
I am not responsible
for all the evils of the world.

1:22:09.416 --> 1:22:11.951
Why don't you ask God
about that, preacher, huh?

1:22:11.985 --> 1:22:14.354
Who is responsible for
creating this whole mess?

1:22:15.488 --> 1:22:18.391
I didn't ask for this.
To be born into this.

1:22:18.425 --> 1:22:20.960
No. I came up from nothing.

1:22:20.994 --> 1:22:23.430
I am just playing
the garbage hand I was dealt,

1:22:23.463 --> 1:22:26.232
trying to make a dollar
like everybody else!

1:22:26.266 --> 1:22:29.602
And you don't get to judge me,
the things you've done.

1:22:31.738 --> 1:22:35.442
Oh, come on! These girls,
they were never gonna make it.

1:22:35.475 --> 1:22:37.744
You know that.
Not one of 'em.

1:22:37.777 --> 1:22:40.513
Orphans, addicts, homeless.

1:22:40.547 --> 1:22:43.817
Now, we only sell
to the best select clients.

1:22:43.850 --> 1:22:46.953
Millionaires, billionaires!

1:22:46.986 --> 1:22:48.521
We did these girls a favor!

1:22:53.293 --> 1:22:56.329
You can't do this.
You know you can't do this.

1:22:56.362 --> 1:22:58.631
Now, wait a minute.
Stop! Just stop!

1:25:09.163 --> 1:25:10.597
<i>You were out!</i>

1:25:10.630 --> 1:25:12.632
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

1:25:13.833 --> 1:25:16.035
<i>You're a man of God.
You killed that guy!</i>

1:25:16.069 --> 1:25:17.238
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

1:25:17.271 --> 1:25:20.974
<i>Two more men
need to die. They're the last.</i>

1:25:21.007 --> 1:25:23.776
- <i>Save yourself.</i>
- <i>There's gotta be a way out.</i>

1:25:28.047 --> 1:25:29.382
You have to let go.

1:26:04.017 --> 1:26:06.653
A new cycle begins.

1:26:09.689 --> 1:26:12.458
The blood is set free
to pass through the flame

1:26:12.492 --> 1:26:15.662
and is transformed, purified.

1:26:15.695 --> 1:26:18.464
Where there was once
sickness and decay,

1:26:18.498 --> 1:26:21.235
there is now light,

1:26:21.268 --> 1:26:25.004
energy, purpose.

1:26:27.274 --> 1:26:29.676
The spirit passes
through the flame,

1:26:29.709 --> 1:26:33.213
and it is transformed
and purified.

1:26:33.247 --> 1:26:36.950
Where there was once
confusion and suffering,

1:26:36.983 --> 1:26:39.253
there is now peace.

1:26:41.554 --> 1:26:45.192
The mind is set free
to pass through the flame,

1:26:45.225 --> 1:26:48.962
and it is transformed, purified.

1:27:01.741 --> 1:27:05.011
He's gonna hurt the teacher!
Stop him!

1:27:05.044 --> 1:27:06.846
No! No!

1:27:10.083 --> 1:27:11.718
Stand back!

1:27:11.751 --> 1:27:14.487
Stand back and have no fear.

1:27:17.090 --> 1:27:18.024
No fear.

1:27:19.959 --> 1:27:23.930
This man has come
with a very specific purpose.

1:27:23.963 --> 1:27:25.765
Haven't you, preacher?

1:27:30.603 --> 1:27:33.072
To transition me
into the flames.

1:27:33.106 --> 1:27:39.579
To end my journey here
as Reese, your teacher.

1:27:39.612 --> 1:27:40.847
No, teacher, you can't!

1:28:11.978 --> 1:28:15.349
- <i>Reverend!</i>
- <i>Remember what you've learned.</i>

1:28:15.382 --> 1:28:18.051
<i>Now, are you ready
to let it all go?</i>

1:28:18.084 --> 1:28:19.052
<i>All the people you harmed?</i>

1:28:26.293 --> 1:28:29.062
<i>Killing those men
isn't gonna bring her back.</i>

1:28:29.095 --> 1:28:30.797
Do it, preacher.

1:28:32.031 --> 1:28:35.601
<i>Mercy
is a rare and powerful tool.</i>

1:28:35.635 --> 1:28:36.836
<i>Tabitha.</i>

1:28:41.874 --> 1:28:45.111
<i>"Blessed are the peacekeepers.
Blessed are the merciful."</i>

1:28:45.144 --> 1:28:46.313
<i>I know what I said.</i>

1:28:46.346 --> 1:28:47.713
<i>So stop.</i>

1:28:54.221 --> 1:28:55.189
No.

1:28:57.391 --> 1:28:59.058
You live with yourself.

1:29:01.395 --> 1:29:03.596
Your judgment
will come soon enough.

1:29:09.869 --> 1:29:11.037
I knew it.

1:29:12.839 --> 1:29:15.007
I knew that you would fail.

1:29:21.281 --> 1:29:23.350
Run away, preacher.

1:29:23.383 --> 1:29:26.286
You liar. You fraud!

1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:28.422
You failure, you two
deserve each other!

1:29:28.455 --> 1:29:30.089
The both of you, you're weak!

1:29:30.123 --> 1:29:33.427
Undisciplined! I have no
more use for you or her!

1:29:33.460 --> 1:29:36.762
You take her, you hear me?
Take her!

1:29:36.796 --> 1:29:38.898
That's right.
You take her and go!

1:29:40.300 --> 1:29:42.135
She's being punished
down in the barrels.

1:29:42.169 --> 1:29:45.004
She might even still be alive.
I hope she is!

1:29:45.037 --> 1:29:46.839
Because you two
deserve each other.

1:29:46.873 --> 1:29:48.908
I want you two to live
your lives out together.

1:29:48.941 --> 1:29:52.778
Your small,
boring, pointless lives!

1:29:52.812 --> 1:29:56.682
Never growing, changing,
never expanding your minds!

1:29:56.716 --> 1:29:58.985
Just living day
by pathetic day,

1:29:59.018 --> 1:30:01.388
working, praying,
mediocre, impotent,

1:30:01.421 --> 1:30:04.056
obedient to your
corporate masters!

1:30:05.459 --> 1:30:07.793
I could think
of no greater punishment.

1:30:08.362 --> 1:30:10.062
Do you hear me?

1:30:36.490 --> 1:30:37.790
Tabitha?

1:31:04.951 --> 1:31:06.220
Tabitha?

1:31:06.253 --> 1:31:07.187
Tabitha.

1:31:17.129 --> 1:31:18.498
Oh, God.

1:31:18.532 --> 1:31:20.866
Tabitha. Tabitha?

1:31:27.374 --> 1:31:28.308
Reverend?

1:31:31.010 --> 1:31:31.978
Hey.

1:31:33.946 --> 1:31:35.982
I knew you were coming.

1:31:40.287 --> 1:31:42.955
How'd you...
How'd you find me?

1:31:46.560 --> 1:31:49.095
I almost didn't.

1:31:59.506 --> 1:32:01.375
Almost didn't.

1:32:06.078 --> 1:32:07.046
Is it over?

1:32:49.589 --> 1:32:53.327
So, who will be next
to speak into the flame?

1:32:55.395 --> 1:32:56.962
Daisy?

1:32:58.165 --> 1:32:59.299
Come on up here.

1:33:02.669 --> 1:33:03.969
Who is that?

1:33:04.671 --> 1:33:06.206
- Teacher!
- Who is that?

1:33:06.239 --> 1:33:09.176
This is private property!
You are tres...

1:33:10.976 --> 1:33:14.448
Don't shoot! I'll give you money!
I swear. Anything!

1:33:22.656 --> 1:33:24.224
It's done.

1:33:24.257 --> 1:33:25.858
<i>And Beckman?</i>

1:33:27.394 --> 1:33:29.229
He's not here.

1:33:29.262 --> 1:33:32.098
Find him. Finish it.
