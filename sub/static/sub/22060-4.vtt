Okay, okay, let me in, Carol.

Wake up!

Arthur!
I'm with my neighbor...

01:13.123 --> 01:15.391
Hey. What
do we got?

01:15.393 --> 01:16.859
So far we got nothing.

01:16.861 --> 01:18.060
What do you mean,
nothing?

01:18.062 --> 01:19.495
Not even shell casings?
Nope.

01:19.497 --> 01:20.896
Any physical evidence at all?

01:20.898 --> 01:23.299
Nada. Nil.

01:23.301 --> 01:25.034
Oh, boy.

01:28.805 --> 01:30.039
I know what
you're thinking.

01:30.041 --> 01:32.408
Well, if it walks like a duck
and talks like a duck,

01:32.410 --> 01:34.410
it's probably
a professional hit.

01:34.412 --> 01:35.911
You think it's the
Robert Cofey case?

01:35.913 --> 01:37.012
What else could it be?

01:37.014 --> 01:38.314
I mean, it's the best case

01:38.316 --> 01:40.082
we've had against
a mobster in a decade.

01:40.084 --> 01:41.584
It's a case
that's gonna

01:41.586 --> 01:44.253
put Cofey away--
a career mobster.

01:44.255 --> 01:46.922
And our star witness happens
to be our fallen cop.

01:46.924 --> 01:48.491
I'd say it's
a good place to start.

01:48.493 --> 01:50.159
You're probably right.
You speak to the wife?

01:50.161 --> 01:52.194
She say anything?
Maybe he got a threat

01:52.196 --> 01:53.429
and told her about it.

01:53.431 --> 01:55.364
She was taken to Bellevue
hyperventilating.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.732
Great. What about neighbors?

01:56.734 --> 01:58.701
Neighbor
mentioned Hines

01:58.703 --> 02:00.870
said something to him
just before he passed.

02:00.872 --> 02:02.338
What, like last word?

02:02.340 --> 02:04.006
More like one word.

02:04.008 --> 02:06.942
What was it?

02:06.944 --> 02:07.943
Cofey.

02:07.945 --> 02:09.512
Quack, quack.

02:27.697 --> 02:29.198
What is it?

02:29.200 --> 02:30.866
I thought I heard something.

02:36.039 --> 02:37.506
Stay here.

02:37.508 --> 02:38.974
Garrett, don't.

02:38.976 --> 02:41.243
Stay here.

02:59.062 --> 03:00.763
Huh?

03:18.648 --> 03:20.015
Police!

03:21.085 --> 03:22.852
Hands up!

03:22.854 --> 03:23.919
Gun!

03:23.921 --> 03:25.421
Gun! He's got a gun!

03:28.425 --> 03:29.959
Don't move!
Do not resist!

03:29.961 --> 03:31.894
Hold still!

03:31.896 --> 03:32.828
Oh, my God!

03:32.830 --> 03:34.430
No!
- Ma'am, ma'am!

03:36.100 --> 03:37.299
No!

03:42.873 --> 03:44.139
Cynthia!

03:44.141 --> 03:46.108
Get off her!

03:46.110 --> 03:48.978
Get off her!

I might add.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.532
Of course.

04:37.534 --> 04:40.035
He stepped on my face
with his boot.

04:40.037 --> 04:42.439
Well, you did have
a gun in your hand.

04:42.606 --> 04:44.537
Because I thought someone

04:44.538 --> 04:46.905
Hey, come on,
let's get some coffee.

04:51.711 --> 04:54.746
Look, you got "swatted."

04:54.748 --> 04:57.782
Someone called 911, said you
were holding Cynthia hostage,

04:57.784 --> 05:00.952
you had a gun, and you
were threatening to kill her.

05:00.954 --> 05:03.321
And they didn't verify?
- Well, how?

05:03.323 --> 05:04.259
They thought
you were the problem.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.359
I don't care what they thought--
they had false information.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.859
Well, I'm not excusing them.

05:07.861 --> 05:08.994
Somebody could've gotten killed.

05:08.996 --> 05:11.029
On a prank phone call?
And they should

05:11.031 --> 05:12.464
have checked you out, but...

05:12.466 --> 05:13.932
Look, it's a small department.

05:13.934 --> 05:16.501
You can just call in a SWAT
team on an innocent man?

05:16.503 --> 05:19.671
And they actually go?
What kind of a world is this?

05:19.673 --> 05:21.773
You know...

05:21.775 --> 05:24.109
swatting is
usually about revenge.

05:24.111 --> 05:26.912
What are you saying?
I'm just asking.

05:26.914 --> 05:29.881
Anyone out there
with an ax to grind?

05:30.716 --> 05:32.684
No.
- Okay.

05:32.686 --> 05:34.686
You <i>were</i> separated recently.

05:34.688 --> 05:37.055
That's your first guess?
That I had an affair,

05:37.057 --> 05:39.891
and now I've got Glenn Close
and boiled bunnies on my hands?

05:39.893 --> 05:42.027
I'm just asking questions.
And the answer

05:42.029 --> 05:43.461
is no.

05:43.463 --> 05:44.896
Okay.

05:44.898 --> 05:48.400
You were not

bedside manner you've got there.

05:51.305 --> 05:55.240
No, Cynthia does not have
a jealous lover, either.

No, no.

06:20.133 --> 06:21.800
It's okay.

06:21.802 --> 06:24.002
I didn't know your husband

06:24.004 --> 06:26.404
of mutual friends,
and to a man,

06:26.406 --> 06:28.039
they all said he
was a cop's cop.

06:28.041 --> 06:30.508
Around here he's known
as the greatest dad

06:30.510 --> 06:32.644

06:32.646 --> 06:33.912
I'm sure he was.

06:33.914 --> 06:36.881
And, again,
really sorry to have to...

06:36.883 --> 06:39.050
No, no, it's fine, I...

06:39.052 --> 06:40.385
any way I can.

have wanted me to do.

06:42.589 --> 06:44.522
Good. Um...

06:44.524 --> 06:46.458
did you see what happened?

06:46.460 --> 06:49.594
No. I was in the house.

06:49.596 --> 06:52.664
But I heard the shots.

06:52.666 --> 06:54.065
Can you think of anyone

06:54.067 --> 06:56.067
who would have wanted
to hurt your husband?

06:56.069 --> 06:57.969
He was on the job
for 20 years.

06:57.971 --> 07:00.905
I mean, the list
must have been long.

07:00.907 --> 07:02.107
He never mentioned anyone to you

07:02.109 --> 07:04.009
who may have had
an ax to grind with him?

07:04.011 --> 07:07.979
He kept me pretty much in the
dark when it came to his job.

07:07.981 --> 07:10.348
Do you know,
when we were first married,

07:10.350 --> 07:12.417
I used to get
pretty upset, so...

07:12.419 --> 07:15.120
I do the same thing
with my wife.

07:21.460 --> 07:25.230
So, did your husband
mention anyone

07:25.232 --> 07:27.632
making specific threats
recently?

07:27.634 --> 07:29.267
Oh.

07:29.269 --> 07:34.039
You know, um, he did
say something, sort of.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.974
Sort of how?

07:35.976 --> 07:38.677
Well, he's been working
this really big case.

07:38.679 --> 07:41.212
The, uh, Robert Cofey case?

07:41.214 --> 07:42.781
Right, and...

07:42.783 --> 07:44.916
he didn't come out and
say it, 'cause that's not

07:44.918 --> 07:47.018
what he did, but I knew
there was something

07:47.020 --> 07:49.054
about this one that
had him out of sorts.

07:49.056 --> 07:51.589
Um, out of sorts how?

07:51.591 --> 07:53.792
He came home one night,
and he was pretty pissed.

07:53.794 --> 07:56.828
And I asked him what was wrong,
and he said, "Nothing""

07:56.830 --> 07:59.798
But I knew there was something
that was nagging at him.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.965
And he finally said

08:00.967 --> 08:03.201
that it was nothing to
worry about, that...

08:03.203 --> 08:05.370
there was some...

08:05.372 --> 08:08.139
two-bit clown associate
of Robert Cofey

08:08.141 --> 08:09.574
who was trying
to spook him.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.942
I tried to
understand

08:10.944 --> 08:13.344
what he meant,
but he just shook me off.

08:13.346 --> 08:15.246
Did he describe the man to you?

08:15.248 --> 08:17.415
I'm afraid not.

08:31.630 --> 08:35.299
I thought it was you,
and... look at that!

08:35.302 --> 08:37.001
It <i>is</i> you.

08:37.003 --> 08:38.770
Sorry?

08:38.772 --> 08:40.472
I said I thought it was
you, and it is you.

08:40.474 --> 08:43.475
I'm Jimmy Pearson. You know,
remember, Anthony's friend?

08:43.477 --> 08:46.344
Oh, yeah.
How are you doing?

08:46.346 --> 08:47.846
Good. I'm doing good.
Doing real good.

08:47.848 --> 08:50.248
Really good. Really great.
Just excellent.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.283
Good. Good.

08:52.285 --> 08:53.518
How you been?

08:53.520 --> 08:55.153
What?

08:55.155 --> 08:57.088
I was just wondering
how <i>you</i> been?

09:00.092 --> 09:02.026
You ever seen
a treadmill before, Jimmy?

09:02.028 --> 09:04.929
Yeah, is it...
is it that obvious?

09:04.931 --> 09:07.866
We're not really bumping into
each other on accident, are we?

09:07.868 --> 09:09.434
I got a proposition.

09:09.436 --> 09:11.136
And I've got an office
with a staff--

09:11.138 --> 09:12.871
so you have something
to bring me,

09:12.873 --> 09:14.439
you bring it
through the proper channels.

09:14.441 --> 09:16.474
And by proper channels,
I mean your friend Anthony.

09:16.476 --> 09:18.309
Yeah, he told me
to take a hike.

09:18.311 --> 09:19.544
Then take a hike.

09:19.546 --> 09:21.346
He's making a mistake.

09:21.348 --> 09:23.348
This is a good
piece of business.

09:23.350 --> 09:24.783
For me or for you?

09:24.785 --> 09:26.451
For both.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.758
Look, Jimmy,
doesn't take a genius

09:33.760 --> 09:35.493
to see you're in trouble again.

09:35.495 --> 09:37.061
Fair enough.
You know, I'm not...

09:37.063 --> 09:39.697
I-I won't even
deny that, okay?

09:39.699 --> 09:42.734
But, you know, something
else is also true.

09:42.736 --> 09:45.170
I have something
that you want.

09:45.172 --> 09:46.064
Is that right?

09:46.088 --> 09:47.540
Three times you tried
to put the screws

09:47.541 --> 09:49.607
to Benny Tomassi, and
three times you whiffed.

09:49.609 --> 09:53.144
You're looking at the guy who
can get you another at-bat.

09:53.146 --> 09:55.146
You know Tomassi?

09:55.148 --> 09:56.414
Carlo, his son.

09:56.416 --> 09:58.483
You had my attention.
Past tense.

09:58.485 --> 09:59.884
Listen to me!

09:59.886 --> 10:01.519
Six months ago,

10:01.521 --> 10:04.489
Tomassi puts knucklehead
Carlo in charge

10:04.491 --> 10:06.424
of the old man's
stolen car ring.

10:06.426 --> 10:07.992
Don't you get it?

10:07.994 --> 10:11.196
I'm handing you the
Tomassis on a silver platter.

10:19.572 --> 10:22.574
How long were you
partnered up with Arthur?

10:22.576 --> 10:24.108
Almost seven years.

10:24.110 --> 10:26.344
Seven years.
You guys pretty close?

10:26.346 --> 10:28.346
Let's just say Arthur knew me
a hell of a lot better

10:28.348 --> 10:29.614
than my wife ever did.

10:29.616 --> 10:30.748
We're very sorry for your loss.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.050
Not gonna catch
me sitting here

10:32.052 --> 10:33.718
feeling sorry for myself.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.954
Arthur would have kicked my ass
if he saw me doing that.

10:35.956 --> 10:38.022
Look, maybe you can help us
with something.

10:38.024 --> 10:39.691
Anything.
Arthur's wife

10:39.693 --> 10:41.659
said he had come home one night
complaining

10:41.661 --> 10:43.728
that some guy
had threatened him.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.563
He did?
- Yeah, he did.

10:45.565 --> 10:46.731
That doesn't sound like Arthur.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.266
He was a pretty
tough customer.

10:48.268 --> 10:50.068
Usually kept things like that
to himself.

10:50.070 --> 10:52.503
Or maybe
he shared it with his partner.

10:52.505 --> 10:55.673
So, he ever share anything
like that with you?

10:55.675 --> 10:56.941
I don't know.

10:56.943 --> 10:59.244
Anything we can do
to help your memory?

10:59.246 --> 11:00.411
Look, you and I both know

11:00.413 --> 11:01.846
that if something like that
did go down,

11:01.848 --> 11:04.282
Arthur should have put it on
paper and reported it to Intel.

11:04.284 --> 11:07.051
And if he told you, you should
have filled one out, too.

11:07.053 --> 11:10.755
Promise you won't get me
jammed up?

11:10.757 --> 11:12.824
We're not here
to jam anyone up.

11:12.826 --> 11:14.459
We're here
for the same thing, right?

11:14.461 --> 11:16.661
To nail the son of a bitch
who killed your partner.

11:16.663 --> 11:19.230
He told me that one night,
after he left the precinct,

11:19.232 --> 11:21.900
some dude came up to him
all incognito,

11:21.902 --> 11:24.002
told him to shut his mouth
on Robert Cofey.

11:24.004 --> 11:25.603
He give a description?

11:25.605 --> 11:27.238
Well, like I said,
he was incognito,

11:27.240 --> 11:28.873
but Arthur had a gut read
on the guy.

11:28.875 --> 11:29.660
And?

11:29.684 --> 11:33.084
Said it was Cofey's
right hand, Victor Lugo.

11:51.415 --> 11:52.711
How many left?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.178
This is the
penultimate one.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.247
- The what?
- The second to last.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.915
Why didn't you just say
"second to last"?

11:57.917 --> 11:59.850
Why don't you
speak English?

11:59.852 --> 12:02.052
I'm gonna grab a coffee.
Do you want one?

12:02.054 --> 12:04.955
Uh, no.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.159
Hey, wait a second.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.426
What?

12:09.428 --> 12:11.195
Hines outside the precinct.

12:11.197 --> 12:12.930
You got something?

12:14.933 --> 12:18.235
Let me check the picture
from the Victor Lugo file.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.338
That could definitely be him.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.673
Same height,
same build.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.942
Think you better make
that cup of Joe to go.

12:29.115 --> 12:32.783
Okay, yeah. Uh-huh.
I'll talk to you soon.

12:32.785 --> 12:36.120
Queen Sheba, you rang?

12:36.122 --> 12:37.221
Yeah.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.422
What the hell
are you doing here?

12:38.424 --> 12:39.824
I'm enjoying

12:39.826 --> 12:41.859
this delicious apple, kemosabe.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.661
What the hell is going on?

12:43.663 --> 12:44.995
I'm putting Jimmy
on the payroll

12:44.997 --> 12:46.397
as a confidential informant.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.799
Yeah, well, have a lovely day.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.301
Anthony, have a seat.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.735
Anthony, sit down!

12:51.737 --> 12:53.838
An...

12:54.906 --> 12:57.107
Anthony.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.809
- What the hell's going on?
- Yeah.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.045
- D-Did he tell you I already said no to him?
- Yes.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.613
Then what is he doing here?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.748
- He's got a good case.
- Yeah?

13:04.750 --> 13:07.718
Well, whatever Jimmy's got is
good for Jimmy and Jimmy alone.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.420
End of story.

13:12.190 --> 13:13.357
I don't get it.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.159
You're the one
that brought this guy

13:15.161 --> 13:16.894
into our world
in the first place.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.296
Yeah, well, that was different.
Why, because it was your idea?

13:19.298 --> 13:21.565
No. Because it wasn't his idea.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.767
Look, I've been trying
to take Tomassi down for years.

13:23.769 --> 13:25.703
This is an opening
I can't turn down.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.338
I put the drop
on his son,

13:27.340 --> 13:30.307
I'm gonna be able to draw a
straight line to the father.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.776
This is Capone on tax evasion.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.111
Yeah, that's if Jimmy can close.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.547
I have mapped out
a foolproof plan.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.848
Nothing's foolproof with Jimmy.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.283
You know the Midas touch?

13:39.285 --> 13:42.319
He's the opposite. Everything
he touches turns to crap.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.654
Not with us at the helm.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.022
No, with <i>you</i> at the helm.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.724
I can't do this without you.

13:46.726 --> 13:49.326
I'm sorry,
but this is for your own good.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.362
Don't make me make you do this.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.663
I'm sorry, dollface,

13:52.665 --> 13:55.933
but that's exactly
what you're gonna have to do.

13:55.935 --> 13:59.403
Then consider it done.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.210
You can come out now,
knucklehead.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.045
You got what you wanted.

14:10.715 --> 14:14.418
I promise,
best behavior.

14:18.423 --> 14:20.925
There were no shell casings
at the scene.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.359
No forensic evidence

14:22.361 --> 14:23.427
at all so far.

14:23.429 --> 14:26.063
And Detective Reagan
caught the case.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.334
- No hooks?
- No hooks.

14:30.336 --> 14:32.303
Good. Anything he wants.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.239
And make sure we're taking good
care of my officer's family.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.540
Right, boss.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.608
Frank.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.809
- Garrett.
- Hey.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.544
- There he is.
- Yeah.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.712
-How you doing?
- Okay.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.681
- Good to see you, buddy.
- You, too.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.250
I must have missed the memo
about casual Wednesday.

14:46.252 --> 14:49.653
I'm sorry. I, uh, just swung by
to pick up some paperwork.

14:49.655 --> 14:50.688
So, you're not here?

14:50.690 --> 14:52.022
No.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.024
Well, we could kind of use
all hands on deck.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.960
I'm sorry. I didn't realize

14:55.962 --> 14:58.095
what you were carrying
this morning.

14:58.211 --> 15:01.279
Guys, could...
could we have the room?

15:16.719 --> 15:21.835
I'm sorry. Uh, Cynthia-- it's
just, she's not doing very well.

15:21.836 --> 15:23.829
- I've-I've... I've never seen her like this.
- Right. Yeah.

15:23.830 --> 15:25.429
Well, that would be normal.

15:25.431 --> 15:26.897
She's had a traumatic event.

15:26.899 --> 15:28.265
You know, sometimes just saying

15:28.267 --> 15:30.668
you have the right to be
freaked out is half the battle.

15:30.670 --> 15:31.902
Easier said than done.

15:31.904 --> 15:34.672
Well, tell her
I called the Bronxville PD.

15:34.674 --> 15:35.973
You will be getting

15:35.975 --> 15:37.875
a letter of apology,
and I assure you,

15:37.877 --> 15:40.077
you will not be getting swatted
again.

15:40.079 --> 15:42.079
I'm not sure
that's gonna work, either.

15:42.081 --> 15:44.749
I-I need to be with her.

15:47.285 --> 15:49.854
How long are you gonna be out?

15:49.856 --> 15:51.022
I don't know.

15:51.024 --> 15:54.258
Well, do what you got to do.

15:54.260 --> 15:56.157
I'm sorry. I-I just need time
to see this through.

15:56.158 --> 15:59.831
Garrett, I have a dead cop,
and his killer's in the wind.

15:59.832 --> 16:02.900
Would you ask Sid and Abigail
back in, please?

16:03.735 --> 16:05.870
Right.

16:12.345 --> 16:14.879
- You're sure Carlo's gonna be there today?
- Every day.

16:14.881 --> 16:16.614
And he'll handle
the exchange himself?

16:16.616 --> 16:19.150
He knows. I only
deal with Carlo.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.485
I bring the car in, he
gives it the once-over,

16:21.487 --> 16:22.987
and then we're done.

16:22.989 --> 16:25.623
Okay, you need to mention
the money, and you need

16:25.625 --> 16:28.259
to make sure you mention
where you stole the car from.

16:28.261 --> 16:30.628
- I got it.
- Okay, you need to get it on the wire.

16:30.630 --> 16:33.631
The longer, the better,
the stronger the case is.

16:33.633 --> 16:35.800
Jimmy's got you
covered, all right?

16:35.802 --> 16:37.802
I can flap them gums
with the best of 'em.

16:37.804 --> 16:39.103
Where's the ride?

16:39.105 --> 16:40.638
It's coming.

16:42.974 --> 16:44.642
You got me a 911?

16:44.644 --> 16:46.343
I didn't get you anything.
The second

16:46.345 --> 16:48.446
we make the arrest, that's
going back on the flatbed.

16:48.448 --> 16:50.714
I got it. I got it.

16:54.886 --> 16:56.294
You need a hand there, Ant?
Let me give you...

16:56.318 --> 16:57.556
Get the hell away from me!

16:57.557 --> 16:59.490
Whoa. Easy, big boy.
You're gonna kill

16:59.492 --> 17:00.658
the shocks on that thing

17:00.660 --> 17:01.759
and blow this whole deal.

17:01.761 --> 17:03.027
You want to blow the deal?

17:03.029 --> 17:04.328
I'll put your head right
through the windshield.

17:04.329 --> 17:05.695
Come on, come on,
come on. Knock it off.

17:05.698 --> 17:06.415
Does he know what
he's got to do?

17:06.439 --> 17:08.032
He knows. I told him.

17:08.034 --> 17:09.767
Yeah, I know. I got it up here,
Ant. Don't worry about it.

17:09.769 --> 17:11.301
All right?
Now if you don't mind...

17:22.547 --> 17:23.948
Oh.

17:25.383 --> 17:27.550
Hey, watch it!

17:48.640 --> 17:50.441
Victor Lugo.

17:50.443 --> 17:53.944
Detective Reagan,
partner Detective Baez.

17:53.946 --> 17:56.480
You two lost? Doughnut
shop's across the street.

17:56.482 --> 17:58.415
That's funny.

17:58.417 --> 17:59.517
You think of that
all by yourself?

17:59.519 --> 18:02.253
Just busting chops, <i>defectives.</i>

18:02.255 --> 18:04.421
"Defectives." Yeah,
that's another good one.

18:04.423 --> 18:06.490
Never heard that before.
What do you want?

18:06.492 --> 18:08.559
Came down to escort you
to the squad room.

18:08.561 --> 18:11.061
Now, that's funny.

18:11.063 --> 18:12.329
Well, we just got
a few questions.

18:12.331 --> 18:13.464
Won't take but a minute.

18:13.466 --> 18:15.499
Tell you what, why don't you
call my assistant,

18:15.501 --> 18:16.600
Ben Dover,

18:16.602 --> 18:17.835
and make an appointment?

18:17.837 --> 18:20.104
"Ben Dover." That's good.

18:20.106 --> 18:21.272
Ben. Ben Dover.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.907
Yeah, you're just
chock-full of jokes, aren't you?

18:22.909 --> 18:25.109
Okay, have it your way.
We'll just talk to you here

18:25.111 --> 18:26.110
in front of all your friends.

18:26.112 --> 18:28.045
I'm sure they'll
like that.

18:28.047 --> 18:29.146
Where were you the morning
of October 10?

18:29.148 --> 18:30.614
Why don't you ask your wife?

18:33.886 --> 18:36.587
You ever disrespect
my wife again,

18:36.589 --> 18:37.955
that blade'll go
through your throat

18:37.957 --> 18:39.523
like a stick of butter--
you got it?

18:39.525 --> 18:41.358
You psycho.

18:42.929 --> 18:45.362
Ah...

18:45.364 --> 18:46.564
You're psycho.

18:46.566 --> 18:48.232
Yeah, a psycho who's gonna
lock you up in a box

18:48.234 --> 18:49.500
for life for
killing a cop.

18:49.502 --> 18:50.868
Whoa, I didn't kill no cop.

18:50.870 --> 18:51.835
Well, we think you did.

18:51.837 --> 18:53.904
Sit down!

18:58.009 --> 18:59.677
You're fishing.

18:59.679 --> 19:01.111
Trying to get me
to take chump bait,

19:01.113 --> 19:02.279
but I ain't no dummy.

19:02.281 --> 19:04.014
And we ain't no fishermen.
We got video of you

19:04.016 --> 19:06.450
threatening Detective Hines
outside his precinct.

19:06.452 --> 19:08.552
I'm not saying another word
without my lawyer.

19:10.590 --> 19:12.122
- What's so funny?
- Well, I thought you said

19:12.124 --> 19:13.991
you weren't a dummy,
but you just told us

19:13.993 --> 19:17.127
everything we needed to hear.

19:17.129 --> 19:19.697
Now, call your lawyer,
tough guy.

19:35.950 --> 19:37.550
Is there any chance you can
give me an actual

19:37.552 --> 19:39.185
usable image off this?

19:39.187 --> 19:42.121
Um... pretty damn close.

19:42.123 --> 19:43.289
Close enough
so I could use it

19:43.291 --> 19:45.858
with the facial recognition
software, maybe?

19:45.860 --> 19:46.992
Can't make any promises,

19:46.994 --> 19:48.894
but this is a pretty
decent image,

19:48.896 --> 19:50.963
so only time will tell.
How much time?

19:50.965 --> 19:53.399
It's not math, it's art.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.768
Art. Okay.

19:56.937 --> 19:58.404
Reagan.
- Hey, what's up?

19:58.406 --> 20:00.172
Lugo is here.

20:00.174 --> 20:01.373
Came in on his own? Great.

20:01.375 --> 20:02.875
Just throw him in the box,
I'll be right there.

20:02.877 --> 20:04.243
Not on his own.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.445
What do you mean,
"not on his own"?

20:06.447 --> 20:09.014
Hey, don't tell me he brought
some jackass lawyer with him.

20:09.016 --> 20:11.417
Detective Reagan.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.853
Herbert Talbott,
attorney for Mr. Lugo.

20:13.855 --> 20:15.421
You have a minute?

20:19.860 --> 20:21.627
Right this way.

20:30.770 --> 20:32.872
What can we help you with?
Signed affidavits

20:32.874 --> 20:34.807
from various witnesses
who swear under oath

20:34.809 --> 20:36.275
that you physically
assaulted my client.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.078
You got to be kidding me.
And finally,

20:39.080 --> 20:40.646
a medical report from
two separate doctors

20:40.648 --> 20:42.014
highlighting just how
close you came

20:42.016 --> 20:43.749
to severing my client's
carotid artery

20:43.751 --> 20:45.384
as a result
of the incident.

20:45.386 --> 20:47.486
You think this is
supposed to scare us off?

20:47.488 --> 20:49.722
Our intention is to educate,
not intimidate, Detective.

20:49.724 --> 20:50.890
Educate?

20:50.892 --> 20:52.324
Educate.

20:53.393 --> 20:54.727
Subsequent to this meeting,

20:54.729 --> 20:56.028
my client will be filing

20:56.030 --> 20:57.897
a formal complaint
with the department.

20:57.899 --> 21:01.433
Hopefully, this incident will
serve to inspire the NYPD

21:01.435 --> 21:02.868
to better train its personnel.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.170
Yeah. This is a bunch of
trumped up garbage, okay?

21:05.172 --> 21:06.438
Your client
barely got a nick.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.374
In fact, he probably did
that shaving this morning.

21:08.376 --> 21:10.175
And I quote:

21:10.177 --> 21:12.645
"Another two centimeters

21:12.647 --> 21:14.146
"and the patient would most
certainly have died

21:14.148 --> 21:17.516
as a result
of this laceration."

21:18.920 --> 21:21.420
Let's go.

21:21.422 --> 21:23.555
Look, the best you can hope for
is I get modified for a week.

21:23.557 --> 21:24.924
Which doesn't change the fact

21:24.926 --> 21:26.692
that I got video of your client

21:26.694 --> 21:28.027
threatening Detective Hines,

21:28.029 --> 21:30.262
which is gonna put him away
for the rest of his life.

21:30.264 --> 21:32.264
Ah, I'm glad you
brought that up.

21:32.266 --> 21:33.632
I almost forgot.

21:33.634 --> 21:35.501
My client was at
the Elastic Gym

21:35.503 --> 21:38.437
at the time of Detective Hines'
unfortunate passing.

21:38.439 --> 21:39.872
Right.

21:41.708 --> 21:44.209
Time-stamped 7:11 a.m.

21:56.356 --> 21:57.790
Have a nice day,
Detectives.

22:02.228 --> 22:05.264
Later, defective.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.446
Hey, moron.

22:20.448 --> 22:21.914
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

22:21.916 --> 22:23.349
Can you believe this ride?

22:23.351 --> 22:24.583
Turn it down, idiot.

22:24.585 --> 22:26.585
You think I want you
drawing attention over here?

22:26.587 --> 22:29.188
Right, you're right. Sorry.

22:32.258 --> 22:33.492
It's sick, right?

22:33.494 --> 22:35.294
Three-year-old 911.

22:35.296 --> 22:36.996
Fully loaded.

22:36.998 --> 22:38.130
It's not bad.

22:38.132 --> 22:40.265
Not bad? This thing is mint.

22:40.267 --> 22:41.433
How hot is it?

22:41.435 --> 22:42.634
Cool as a cucumber.

22:42.636 --> 22:43.836
I clipped it from JFK.

22:43.838 --> 22:45.137
Can you believe some numb-nuts

22:45.139 --> 22:47.606
left this beautiful baby
in long-term parking?

22:47.608 --> 22:48.774
I'll give you 20.

22:48.776 --> 22:51.310
What are you, back on the pipe?

22:51.312 --> 22:53.178
This is a $100,000 car.

22:53.180 --> 22:55.247
That sticks out
like a sore thumb.

22:56.316 --> 22:58.450
25.

22:58.452 --> 23:00.652
Not a penny under 40.

23:00.654 --> 23:02.855
30. Final offer.

23:02.857 --> 23:04.156
Have it your way.

23:04.158 --> 23:05.457
I'll let your old man know

23:05.459 --> 23:07.426
that you don't know a deal
when you see one.

23:07.428 --> 23:10.796
How do you think Benny Tomassi's
gonna feel about that?

23:23.376 --> 23:24.643
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

23:24.645 --> 23:26.078
What are you doing?!

23:27.347 --> 23:28.781
Okay, fine.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.382
35.

23:30.384 --> 23:33.118
See, now you're acting
like a gentleman.

23:51.137 --> 23:52.204
Let me see your hands!

23:53.407 --> 23:55.407
Police!
Get your hands up!

23:56.976 --> 23:58.677
Hands on the ground!

24:00.146 --> 24:02.448
- You have the right to remain silent.
- See those hands.

24:09.122 --> 24:10.355
Art class is over.

24:10.357 --> 24:12.491
I don't think so.
I got good news.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.760
Pack it up, Picasso.
He ain't the guy.

24:14.762 --> 24:16.428
So this is not his tattoo?

24:16.430 --> 24:18.263
Tattoo?

24:18.265 --> 24:20.466
Mm-hmm.

24:20.468 --> 24:22.267
Show me what you got.

24:25.505 --> 24:28.140
You got to get closer.
Uh...

24:29.142 --> 24:31.577
Any tighter than that
and it'll distort...

24:31.579 --> 24:34.146
May I?

24:37.550 --> 24:39.852
That is a work of art.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.887
Tell Baez I'll be back.

24:42.889 --> 24:45.924
I'm man enough to
admit it when I'm wrong.

24:45.926 --> 24:47.459
Jimmy did a good job.

24:47.461 --> 24:48.827
A real good job.

24:48.829 --> 24:50.496
The way he said
Benny Tomassi's name

24:50.498 --> 24:51.830
on the wire.

24:51.832 --> 24:53.632
No doubt.
Slam dunk.

24:53.634 --> 24:56.201
See? Aren't you glad
I twisted your arm?

24:56.203 --> 24:57.636
Erin knows best.

24:57.638 --> 24:58.904
There you are.

24:58.906 --> 25:01.206
This is Dale Quinn,
attorney for Carlo Tomassi.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.709
Well, good afternoon, Mr. Quinn.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.544
I'm sorry you're having
a crappy day.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.112
On the contrary.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.514
Nothing puts a bounce in my step

25:08.516 --> 25:09.781
like a victory over the state.

25:09.783 --> 25:11.116
Victory?

25:11.118 --> 25:13.619
Are you familiar with a young
woman named Grace Allesi?

25:14.554 --> 25:16.588
Get to the point,
Mr. Quinn.

25:16.590 --> 25:18.924
Grace Allesi is
Carlo Tomassi's girlfriend.

25:18.926 --> 25:22.761
Well, I hope their romance
can survive his incarceration.

25:22.763 --> 25:26.098
I'm afraid there
won't be any incarceration.

25:26.100 --> 25:29.401
You see, Grace used to be
Jimmy Pearson's girlfriend.

25:30.870 --> 25:32.671
Damn it.

25:32.673 --> 25:34.740
I don't get it. So what?

25:34.742 --> 25:36.341
He's going to
make the argument

25:36.343 --> 25:38.844
that my prosecution
is driven by personal bias

25:38.846 --> 25:40.646
against his client.

25:40.648 --> 25:42.748
What? It's got
nothing to do with you.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.216
It's got to do with Jimmy.

25:44.218 --> 25:45.984
And the same Jimmy Pearson,
who, as a paid

25:45.986 --> 25:47.419
confidential informant,

25:47.421 --> 25:49.855
is viewed by the court
as an employee of this office.

25:49.857 --> 25:51.557
I can still beat you in court.

25:51.559 --> 25:53.225
Who are you kidding?
After I leak it to the press,

25:53.227 --> 25:56.695
you won't get this case within
a hundred feet of a courtroom.

25:56.697 --> 25:58.096
I'll give you 24 hours
to release Carlo

25:58.098 --> 26:00.799
before it all goes online.

26:03.870 --> 26:07.072
Don't say it.
Not a word.

26:07.074 --> 26:08.707
Not a word.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.723
He's here.

26:24.725 --> 26:26.291
Okay.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.392
How is he?

26:27.394 --> 26:29.294
Don't ask.
- Baker made it sound like

26:29.296 --> 26:30.696
you wanted me ASAP.

26:30.698 --> 26:34.132
All good.
All good.

26:36.236 --> 26:37.502
How's Cynthia?

26:37.504 --> 26:39.304
Still a little fragile.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.139
I won't bore you
with the details.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.909
If you think you are owed
an apology, I'm sorry.

26:43.911 --> 26:45.877
I never thought "owed."

26:45.879 --> 26:47.613
Well, whatever.
There it is.

26:47.615 --> 26:49.581
Take it or leave it.

26:50.917 --> 26:52.484
You do remember
what we do here--

26:52.486 --> 26:55.254
a hundred things at once,
many of them life or death?

26:55.256 --> 26:57.556
Please don't patronize me.

26:57.558 --> 26:58.590
Then, please don't make me.

26:58.592 --> 27:00.025
You know, there was
a small part of me

27:00.027 --> 27:02.594
that thought you might actually
be understanding about this.

27:02.596 --> 27:03.996
I should have known.

27:03.998 --> 27:05.731
I understand, I do.

27:05.733 --> 27:08.800
I just have limited ways
and means to express it.

27:08.802 --> 27:10.369
I wasn't issued
a set of brass balls

27:10.371 --> 27:11.970
at the police academy
like the rest of you.

27:11.972 --> 27:13.138
Police academy?

27:13.140 --> 27:14.773
Let's be honest, Frank,
I'm a civilian.

27:14.775 --> 27:17.743
Well, who works alongside
the best cops in the world.

27:17.745 --> 27:19.044
Not the same thing.

27:19.046 --> 27:20.679
I thought this was
about Cynthia.

27:20.681 --> 27:21.680
This is about both of us.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.015
This happened
to both of us!

27:23.017 --> 27:25.417
Stop! Please.

27:32.125 --> 27:35.027
Sit down, my friend.

27:44.604 --> 27:48.040
Okay, the guy who did this
went through several routers

27:48.042 --> 27:49.708
and multiple firewalls.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.843
So, knew how to hide.

27:51.845 --> 27:54.613
Yeah, exactly, so...

27:54.615 --> 27:57.649
let me ask you-- who did this?

27:57.651 --> 28:00.719
- Who swatted me? I have no idea.
- I think you do.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.387
And I'm telling you
I don't.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.823
- I think you're shortchanging yourself.
- What?

28:04.825 --> 28:07.826
Just push all the anxiety
and the fear

28:07.828 --> 28:09.561
and the guilt
out the door.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.963
Push me out the door.
Empty the room.

28:11.965 --> 28:14.833
I'm telling you...
Just shut up a minute.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.371
Who's left in the room?

28:19.373 --> 28:21.740
No one.

28:21.742 --> 28:22.874
Who did it, Garrett?

28:22.876 --> 28:23.875
I don't know.

28:23.877 --> 28:25.377
Who's in the room?

28:27.146 --> 28:29.848
There! That.
What was that?

28:29.850 --> 28:31.583
What was what?
You caught a glimpse.

28:31.585 --> 28:34.086
- It was nothing.
- You caught a glimpse. Of who?

28:34.088 --> 28:36.321
This is nuts.
Just say the name.

28:36.323 --> 28:37.489
Is this some kind of card trick?

28:37.491 --> 28:39.391
Just say it.
Don't overcomplicate it,

28:39.393 --> 28:41.093
just let it out.

28:41.095 --> 28:42.194
Adam Cassir.

28:42.196 --> 28:44.763
Yes!
Who's Adam Cassir?

28:44.765 --> 28:46.898
It's not possible.

28:46.900 --> 28:50.569
Who is he?
A 16-year-old blind boy.

28:54.807 --> 28:57.576
Oh.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.816
Hey, Detective Ogden.

29:04.818 --> 29:06.284
Hey, Reagan.
How's it going?

29:06.286 --> 29:08.887
Well... to be quite
honest with you,

29:08.889 --> 29:10.055
it's not going so good.

29:10.057 --> 29:13.325
Lugo, it turns out,
has a rock-solid alibi.

29:13.327 --> 29:14.626
- He does?
- Yeah.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.328
His lawyer
came by the squad,

29:16.330 --> 29:18.463
showed me all these photos
of him working out at the gym

29:18.465 --> 29:20.298
at the exact same time
of the murder.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.367
Well, maybe the shooter was
one of Lugo's goons.

29:22.369 --> 29:24.002
Yeah, maybe, but it was

29:24.004 --> 29:26.304
Lugo who threatened
Hines, right?

29:26.306 --> 29:28.407
Hines told you that
personally, right?

29:28.409 --> 29:29.775
100%.

29:29.777 --> 29:31.810
Okay, good.
That's good.

29:31.812 --> 29:34.012
That's, uh, that's
very helpful.

29:34.014 --> 29:36.381
- It's just, um...
- What is it?

29:36.383 --> 29:37.616
Well,

29:37.618 --> 29:39.418
yeah, it's just something's
not adding up.

29:39.420 --> 29:41.286
- What?
- Well, you see,

29:41.288 --> 29:42.954
we got the surveillance
footage,

29:42.956 --> 29:45.924
like you said,
then we found in the footage

29:45.926 --> 29:48.727
the meeting between Lugo
and Hines outside the precinct.

29:48.729 --> 29:50.495
So what's the problem?

29:50.497 --> 29:53.698
Well, the problem
is that it's, uh,

29:53.700 --> 29:55.901
it's not Lugo
on the video.

29:55.903 --> 29:59.438
I mean, Hines said that
the guy was all incognito.

29:59.440 --> 30:02.707
Yeah, well, that's because the
guy on the video has a tattoo.

30:02.709 --> 30:04.142
What kind of tattoo?

30:04.144 --> 30:06.044
Um, you know,

30:06.046 --> 30:08.613
it's not important,
actually, um...

30:08.615 --> 30:10.715
Anyway, thanks for your help.
Okay.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.220
Actually,

30:15.222 --> 30:18.690
it's a tattoo
that looks just like that one.

30:21.894 --> 30:25.497
You want to tell me what
the hell's going on, Detective?

30:37.555 --> 30:39.155
Come have a drink.

30:39.522 --> 30:40.354
Ralph,

30:40.356 --> 30:41.822
a 7 and 7, please.

30:41.824 --> 30:42.957
And a bunch

30:42.959 --> 30:44.625
of beers for my friends
over here!

30:44.627 --> 30:45.860
My friends!

30:45.862 --> 30:47.662
All my friends.

30:50.667 --> 30:53.134
Oh!

30:53.136 --> 30:55.102
- Having a good night, Jimmy?
- Yeah, yeah.

30:55.104 --> 30:57.805
I'm having a good time. Anthony,
this is my friend, Kira.

30:57.807 --> 30:59.373
- This is... this is, uh, Anthony.
- Hi.

30:59.375 --> 31:00.574
He's a good guy to know.

31:00.576 --> 31:02.510
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

31:02.512 --> 31:03.344
Don't go anywhere.

31:03.346 --> 31:04.679
Now, Jimmy,

31:04.681 --> 31:08.182
time to have that man-to-man
talk I've been promising you.

31:10.452 --> 31:13.020
Reagan, how did you know
he had that tattoo?

31:13.022 --> 31:14.989
I clocked it the first time
we talked to him.

31:14.991 --> 31:16.324
It's a Marine Corps tat.

31:16.326 --> 31:18.759
He say anything when you brought
him in that could help us?

31:18.761 --> 31:20.661
No. As soon as I mentioned
the tat, he dummied up

31:20.663 --> 31:21.896
and he lawyered up.

31:21.898 --> 31:23.698
You really think he's
working for Robert Cofey?

31:23.700 --> 31:25.433
He set his own partner up?
I don't know.

31:25.435 --> 31:28.069
We got to find out where he was
at the time Hines was shot.

31:28.071 --> 31:30.171
His lawyer said not
to say a word to us.

31:30.173 --> 31:32.239
Yeah, but we already know
he was off duty, right?

31:32.241 --> 31:35.242
So let's just stay on that path
and eliminate the possibilities.

31:35.244 --> 31:37.111
How, if he won't talk?

31:37.113 --> 31:39.580
His phone records
will talk, right?

31:39.582 --> 31:41.916
So let's get
his phone records,

31:41.918 --> 31:44.552
see who he called
around the time of the shooting.

31:44.554 --> 31:45.853
And if he did the hit...

31:45.855 --> 31:48.656
Maybe he calls Cofey right
after to say it's done.

31:48.658 --> 31:50.391
Exactly.

31:58.368 --> 31:59.700
Detectives.

31:59.702 --> 32:00.701
We're sorry to bother you again.

32:00.703 --> 32:01.836
Do you... do you have a minute?

32:01.838 --> 32:03.637
Of course. Come in.

32:03.639 --> 32:05.806
Yeah, um,
something came up,

32:05.808 --> 32:08.442
and we were wondering
if you would, uh,

32:08.444 --> 32:09.977
be able to help us out
with it.

32:09.979 --> 32:11.512
Sure. What is it?

32:11.514 --> 32:14.448
We think your husband's partner,

32:14.450 --> 32:17.551
Patrick Ogden, had something to
do with your husband's murder.

32:17.553 --> 32:19.487
Oh, my God.
You can't be serious.

32:19.489 --> 32:23.023
Did your husband ever mention
any uneasiness about Ogden?

32:23.025 --> 32:24.925
Uh, not that I know of.

32:24.927 --> 32:26.494
I mean, you know,
they were partners,

32:26.496 --> 32:29.697
so sometimes they would fight
like an old married couple.

32:29.699 --> 32:33.134
But, um, it was never anything
serious or real.

32:33.136 --> 32:36.170
Did you get along with Ogden,
Mrs. Hines?

32:36.172 --> 32:38.939
I mean, any conflict
between the two of you?

32:40.343 --> 32:42.343
Where are you going with this?
What you getting at?

32:42.345 --> 32:44.145
We canvassed
the neighborhood.

32:44.147 --> 32:45.713
We spoke to one
of your neighbors

32:45.715 --> 32:47.281
who said she
saw you go out

32:47.283 --> 32:50.618
and give your husband his cup of
coffee before leaving for work.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.153
I liked to take care of him.

32:52.155 --> 32:53.154
Is that something

32:53.156 --> 32:54.622
you do every morning?

32:54.624 --> 32:56.924
Well, not every morning
but often enough.

32:56.926 --> 32:59.026
Hmm. That's funny,

32:59.028 --> 33:01.695
because your neighbor told us
that that's the first time

33:01.697 --> 33:03.664
she ever saw you do it.

33:03.666 --> 33:05.599
What does that got to do
with anything?

33:05.601 --> 33:06.934
Well, we actually have a theory.

33:06.936 --> 33:09.403
You see, your husband walked out
the door that morning

33:09.405 --> 33:11.539
with his briefcase
in his left hand,

33:11.541 --> 33:14.842
which meant his right hand,
his shooting hand, was free.

33:14.844 --> 33:17.445
Until you put a cup of
coffee in that hand.

33:17.447 --> 33:18.446
So when the shooter

33:18.448 --> 33:20.247
came out of the bushes,
your husband

33:20.249 --> 33:21.715
was unable to go for his gun

33:21.717 --> 33:23.451
to protect himself.

33:23.453 --> 33:24.785
Okay, this is ridiculous.

33:24.787 --> 33:26.420
I do not need to listen
to this anymore.

33:26.422 --> 33:27.888
You need to get out of my house.

33:27.890 --> 33:29.723
Do you want to know what
your husband's last word was?

33:29.725 --> 33:30.791
"Coffee."

33:30.793 --> 33:32.159
Which we thought
was his way

33:32.161 --> 33:35.930
of telling us that it was
Robert Cofey who'd set him up.

33:35.932 --> 33:37.965
That is, until we realized

33:37.967 --> 33:39.807
that it was actually you
who'd set him up.

33:39.831 --> 33:40.302
No.

33:40.303 --> 33:42.736
Okay, I don't need to listen
to any of this, okay? You need

33:42.738 --> 33:44.538
to leave my house right now.
- We're not going anywhere.

33:44.540 --> 33:48.209
Phone records show hundreds of
calls between you and Mrs. Hines

33:48.211 --> 33:49.243
over the last year.

33:49.245 --> 33:51.412
Were the two of you
having an affair?

33:51.414 --> 33:52.913
Yes.

33:52.915 --> 33:53.848
We were.

33:53.850 --> 33:55.082
And is it true that you

33:55.084 --> 33:59.019
and Mrs. Hines plotted
the murder of her husband?

34:04.759 --> 34:06.026
Yes.

34:06.028 --> 34:07.761
No.

34:07.763 --> 34:09.063
He's lying.

34:09.065 --> 34:10.965
- Okay...
- That's not true! He's lying.

34:10.967 --> 34:12.867
Yeah, well, we think you're
a cop killer, and we're gonna

34:12.869 --> 34:14.101
take you down to the
squad room with us.

34:14.103 --> 34:16.504
No, you don't understand.
I'm a detective's wife.

34:16.505 --> 34:18.239
- Do you understand? He's lying.
- That's great. So you won't have any problems

34:18.241 --> 34:21.108
coming down to the squad. Come on.
- He's lying.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.110
<i>Okay, got it.</i>

34:29.551 --> 34:32.018
Uh, where have you been
all morning?

34:32.021 --> 34:33.721
I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

34:33.723 --> 34:35.656
I had to take care of something.

34:35.658 --> 34:37.424
You had to take care
of something? No.

34:37.426 --> 34:38.726
This is what
we had to take care of.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.395
In less than an hour,
we have to cut Carlo loose.

34:41.397 --> 34:43.931
That's what
I was taking care of.

34:43.933 --> 34:45.099
You already let him go?

34:45.101 --> 34:47.001
Even without talking
to me first?

34:47.003 --> 34:48.369
Relax, would you?

34:48.371 --> 34:49.770
I didn't let anybody go.

34:49.772 --> 34:51.605
And we ain't gonna do nothin'.
Okay, this is

34:51.607 --> 34:53.574
where we get into trouble
with your double negatives.

34:53.576 --> 34:55.442
I literally have no idea
if we're gonna do something

34:55.444 --> 34:56.810
or we're not gonna do anything.

34:56.812 --> 34:58.946
We are not gonna do nothin'.

34:58.948 --> 35:00.748
Yeah. Not helping.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.550
Listen to me,

35:02.552 --> 35:03.918
we are not gonna let Carlo go

35:03.920 --> 35:05.553
and we're not gonna drop
the charges.

35:05.555 --> 35:06.554
We have to.

35:06.556 --> 35:07.655
You heard his lawyer.

35:07.657 --> 35:08.756
We have no case

35:08.758 --> 35:11.392
if it looks like I tried
to prosecute the case

35:11.394 --> 35:14.228
with a personal bias
to helping Jimmy.

35:14.230 --> 35:16.196
Right, but we didn't do it.

35:16.198 --> 35:19.733
It doesn't matter that I know
that or that you know that.

35:19.735 --> 35:22.069
What matters is how his lawyer
makes it appear.

35:22.071 --> 35:24.605
Well, he can't make it
appear that we helped Jimmy

35:24.607 --> 35:25.773
if Jimmy is locked up, too.

35:25.775 --> 35:29.143
But Jimmy didn't
get locked up.

35:29.145 --> 35:30.878
Sure, he did.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.680
First thing this morning.

35:32.682 --> 35:34.415
What?

35:34.417 --> 35:37.418
Jimmy confessed this morning
to stealing multiple cars

35:37.420 --> 35:40.521
and fencing them to Carlo
over the last six months.

35:40.523 --> 35:43.324
Which makes him a codefendant.

35:43.326 --> 35:44.325
What?

35:44.327 --> 35:46.160
True story.

35:46.162 --> 35:48.762
Why the hell would he do that?

35:49.598 --> 35:50.998
You know, my dear,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.601
there are some things that
you don't want to know about.

35:53.603 --> 35:58.038
Believe me,
this is one of them things.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.707
Now,

35:59.709 --> 36:00.975
you hungry? I'm starving.

36:00.977 --> 36:02.209
Let's get some pizza.

36:02.211 --> 36:04.345
Pizza?
It's 10:00 in the morning.

36:04.347 --> 36:06.880
Then how 'bout some meatballs?

36:06.882 --> 36:08.849
Come on.

36:14.357 --> 36:16.323
Wait up.

36:16.325 --> 36:19.193
So I'm good to go.

36:19.195 --> 36:22.196
All a sudden,
this Garrett Moore, this clown,

36:22.198 --> 36:24.798
he goes, "Sorry, kid,

36:24.800 --> 36:27.334
we're not doing Commissioner
for a Day this year."

36:27.336 --> 36:29.136
This is just after
Linda's death.

36:29.138 --> 36:30.070
Yeah.

36:30.072 --> 36:31.338
And I'm like, "Yeah, right."

36:31.340 --> 36:33.841
Like it's got nothing
to do with me being blind?

36:33.843 --> 36:35.242
Give me a break.

36:35.244 --> 36:37.011
So you decided
to get back at him.

36:37.013 --> 36:38.879
Blindside <i>him.</i>

36:38.881 --> 36:41.081
With the SWAT.

36:43.118 --> 36:45.419
Clearly, the kid's got troubles

36:45.421 --> 36:47.388
Commissioner a Day
wasn't gonna fix.

36:47.390 --> 36:49.456
- Exactly.
- Any regrets?

36:49.458 --> 36:50.491
- About the kid?
- Yeah.

36:50.493 --> 36:51.959
- No.
- Well, the way he took it,

36:51.961 --> 36:55.396
that he got blackballed
because he was blind?

36:55.398 --> 36:57.164
Never entered my mind.

36:57.166 --> 36:59.033
If anything,
I thought it was a huge plus

36:59.035 --> 37:00.734
having a blind kid
take the honor.

37:00.736 --> 37:02.336
It just wasn't the right time.

37:02.338 --> 37:03.437
Well, you were protecting me.

37:03.439 --> 37:06.807
I didn't have much
in the tank at the time.

37:06.809 --> 37:08.409
Just doing my job.

37:08.411 --> 37:10.144
Yeah. And you're back at it?

37:10.146 --> 37:11.311
Your job here?

37:11.313 --> 37:12.746
Yes.

37:12.748 --> 37:13.747
Ah.

37:13.749 --> 37:16.016
As it turns out,
my being around

37:16.018 --> 37:19.053
all the time was only adding
to Cynthia's troubles,

37:19.055 --> 37:20.888
not subtracting from.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.990
Ah.

37:24.592 --> 37:29.430
Congratulations on your first
collar, Deputy Commissioner.

37:31.299 --> 37:32.766
Hey, you gave us the name.

37:32.768 --> 37:36.704
Maybe you're a better cop than
you give yourself credit for.

37:36.706 --> 37:38.706
Thank you.

37:38.708 --> 37:41.341
Back to work, Sherlock.

37:41.343 --> 37:44.211
Yes, boss.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.586
<i>Holy guacamole.</i>

37:52.588 --> 37:54.354
Could that have gone on
any longer?

37:54.356 --> 37:56.423
Yeah, talk about
patience of a saint.

37:56.425 --> 37:58.358
Come on.
An hour a week

37:58.360 --> 37:59.793
in God's house?

37:59.795 --> 38:01.462
I think you can spare that.

38:01.464 --> 38:02.896
I don't think
he's talking about the mass.

38:02.898 --> 38:04.898
I'm pretty sure
he meant the homily.

38:04.900 --> 38:06.366
Ramble much, padre?

38:06.368 --> 38:07.901
All right. Respect.

38:07.903 --> 38:11.371
Yeah, keep it down. We're having
a very serious meal down here.

38:11.373 --> 38:13.140
All right. Relax, okay?

38:13.142 --> 38:15.409
Danny's fine. Let's
not worry about Danny.

38:15.411 --> 38:17.111
No one's worrying about Danny.

38:17.113 --> 38:19.413
Except when you refer
to yourself in the third person.

38:19.415 --> 38:22.349
Me, myself and I are doing
just fine, thank you.

38:22.351 --> 38:23.851
It's just that we acknowledge
that, uh,

38:23.853 --> 38:25.919
you got a lot
on your plate is all.

38:25.921 --> 38:28.322
That's not it.

38:30.992 --> 38:33.060
It's about his case.
That's what's bugging him.

38:33.062 --> 38:34.561
And what makes you say that?

38:34.563 --> 38:36.396
Not judging. I'm just saying,
'cause you missed it.

38:36.398 --> 38:39.133
I missed what? What-what
did I-- what'd I miss?

38:40.268 --> 38:42.102
Forget it. Nothing.

38:42.104 --> 38:43.737
Forget what, Jamie?

38:43.739 --> 38:46.173
I'm just saying,
you're mad at yourself

38:46.175 --> 38:48.809
because it got past you.
It being the wife.

38:48.811 --> 38:50.811
It's not the first time
something got past me. So?

38:50.813 --> 38:52.412
No, but you
didn't think...

38:52.414 --> 38:54.114
she would have...

38:54.116 --> 38:55.482
if...

38:55.484 --> 38:56.917
If what?

39:00.088 --> 39:01.955
If what?

39:01.957 --> 39:03.056
Nothing, Danny, really.

39:03.058 --> 39:04.725
Forget it.
- Well, it's something.

39:04.727 --> 39:06.393
Why don't
you finish

39:06.395 --> 39:07.995
what you started here?

39:07.997 --> 39:09.530
My bad. Okay? I'm seeing
something that wasn't there.

39:09.532 --> 39:11.899
Well, we don't bite
our tongues here, Jamie.

39:11.901 --> 39:14.134
Whatever it is you want to say,
just feel free to say it.

39:14.136 --> 39:16.537
Just struck me as funny.
That's it.

39:16.539 --> 39:18.939
"Funny," like ha, ha?

39:18.941 --> 39:21.108
Like I'm a clown?

39:21.110 --> 39:24.111
Like I amuse you?

39:26.080 --> 39:28.282
I'm kidding.

39:32.353 --> 39:35.956
See? Danny's fine.

39:43.064 --> 39:45.799
Pass the potatoes.
