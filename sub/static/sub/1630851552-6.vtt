WEBVTT

00:07.966 --> 00:09.176
Hey, Otis!

00:09.259 --> 00:11.094
-Otis
-Otis!

00:11.178 --> 00:14.306
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:14.389 --> 00:15.641
Hit the brakes!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.559
-Otis
-Otis!

00:17.643 --> 00:20.729
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:20.812 --> 00:21.897
Let's get rolling!

00:21.980 --> 00:24.900
Together on the farm
We play and we work hard

00:24.983 --> 00:28.111
-With help from Otis the tractor
-Yeah!

00:28.195 --> 00:31.365
When he feels his heart glowing
Otis gets going

00:31.448 --> 00:34.576
-So let's get rolling with Otis
-Otis!

00:37.996 --> 00:40.249
"Otis Brings the Sheep Back."

00:47.089 --> 00:49.675
Another day on the farm is done.

00:51.927 --> 00:54.638
Looks like everyone is coming home
for the night.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.268
This way, chickens. Back to the coop.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.688
Come on, piggies.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.196
Hey, where's Louie?

01:11.280 --> 01:14.491
He usually brings all those sheep
back inside.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.869
I wonder where he is.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.621
Ouch.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.379
Hit the brakes! Louie, what happened?

01:28.338 --> 01:31.383
Otis, I hurt my leg.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.010
Are you okay?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.928
It's not terrible.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.472
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

01:37.556 --> 01:40.392
But right now, it hurts when I do this.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.227
Or this.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.271
Or this.

01:46.064 --> 01:49.026
And it hurts when I walk too.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.153
Ouch.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.615
Maybe you should take it easy, Louie.

01:54.698 --> 01:58.327
But I can't.
It's almost dark, and I need to--

01:59.119 --> 02:01.121
Bring the-- Ouch!

02:01.205 --> 02:03.749
Other five sheep baa-ack here.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.001
I'm so frustrated.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.672
I'm a hearty helper.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.884
Could I lead the sheep for you?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.303
Really? You'd do that?

02:16.386 --> 02:18.472
You bet your wool I would.

02:18.555 --> 02:22.976
Just rest, and I'll be back with those
sheep before the sun goes to sleep.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.896
Let's get rolling.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.485
Hey there, sheep.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.619
You see, Louie's got a sore leg,

02:40.702 --> 02:43.580
but I'm here to bring you back
to the pen instead.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.290
So follow me.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.173
Did you hear me?

02:53.257 --> 02:54.591
Time to go home.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.973
Wait, you're right.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.475
That wasn't very polite of me, was it?

03:04.101 --> 03:06.603
Will you follow me, please?

03:08.522 --> 03:11.400
But you have to come back
before it gets dark.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.946
Maybe Louie can tell me
how to get these sheep back.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.494
Otis! Where are the sheep?

03:22.578 --> 03:25.706
They wouldn't follow me. What do I do?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.210
This happens sometimes.

03:30.294 --> 03:34.256
Some sheep just won't come back
until I've picked them a snack.

03:35.465 --> 03:39.553
What I do is grab some apples
from the tree like this.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.597
Owie. Ouch!

03:42.431 --> 03:43.974
Hit the brakes!

03:44.057 --> 03:45.475
Are you okay?

03:46.518 --> 03:49.021
I just forgot about my hurt leg.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.692
I'm saa-ad. Super saa-ad.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.989
Can I pick the apples for the sheep?

03:59.072 --> 04:02.201
Yes, they would love thaa-at.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.785
Farm-tastic!

04:05.621 --> 04:07.706
Let's get rolling!

04:11.877 --> 04:15.088
Hello, sheep. I'm baa-ack.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.964
Louie just told me you like…

04:18.091 --> 04:20.969
Yep! Shiny, red apples coming right up.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.846
Well, down.

04:25.516 --> 04:29.186
The only apples left
are at the very tippy-top.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.607
But not for long. I'll reach 'em.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.403
Maybe I can reach them with this.

04:43.534 --> 04:44.743
Almost.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.079
Almost.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.207
Yes! One apple.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.836
Two apples.

04:56.171 --> 04:59.883
Three, four, five apples.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.681
Come on. Follow me and these
yummy apples back to the sheep pen.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.184
Here we come, Louie!

05:09.268 --> 05:12.855
I've got all five sheep,
and I'm bringing them back.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.648
Just wait till you see!

05:19.236 --> 05:21.613
Louie, here they are.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.491
Five apples for five sheep.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.412
One, two.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.832
There are two sheep,
but there should be five.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.877
Where are the other three?

05:36.503 --> 05:40.841
Oh, no! Why didn't the other three
keep following me?

05:42.384 --> 05:46.096
This does sometimes happen,
but I'll tell you what could work.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.099
-A race.
-A race?

05:49.183 --> 05:51.435
Yes, an obstacle race.

05:51.518 --> 05:55.731
I set up all sorts of stuff
the sheep can run around and hop over.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.359
Like those hay bales.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.279
I start-- with one--

06:03.363 --> 06:06.366
And then-- My leg!

06:08.243 --> 06:11.580
I can't set up an obstacle race
like this.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.874
I'm so disappointed.

06:18.253 --> 06:21.131
Maybe I could set up
the obstacles for you.

06:21.215 --> 06:24.551
Yes, please. Thank you, Otis!

06:26.053 --> 06:28.055
You're very welcome.

06:28.138 --> 06:31.975
I'll have those other three sheep back
faster than you can say…

06:35.771 --> 06:36.897
Hello, you three.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.565
It's me!

06:39.233 --> 06:41.527
How about a race back to your pen?

06:45.030 --> 06:48.825
That's right,
it's a farm-tastic obstacle race.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.619
Check it out.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.623
First, go around here,

06:54.706 --> 06:57.292
then around this one for a loop-de-loop.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.255
Yeah! I knew you'd like it.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.590
Ready, set,

07:03.674 --> 07:04.800
go, go, go!

07:07.928 --> 07:11.431
And the sheep race to home
is off to an exciting start.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.351
The next obstacle is…

07:17.604 --> 07:18.856
this barrel!

07:25.279 --> 07:27.030
Look at you go!

07:27.114 --> 07:29.950
Can you make it over the shovel
and this bucket?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.287
Yes! You're in the homestretch

07:33.370 --> 07:36.456
as you jump a tire
and weave round a wagon.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.834
Now jump that grain bag.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.260
The sheep cross the finish line.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.638
It worked, Louie, look.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.433
Now I brought back all five sheep for you.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.269
Well, let's see.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.481
One, two, three,

08:01.565 --> 08:02.608
four.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.861
Why didn't the fifth one come back?

08:05.944 --> 08:08.322
Oh, right! How could I forget?

08:08.405 --> 08:12.910
That last sheep likes to follow me home
while I sing her favorite song.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.829
But-- The field--

08:16.580 --> 08:17.748
Is so far--

08:18.749 --> 08:20.167
Away.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.086
And I love singing to her.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.381
Hit the brakes.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.800
Are you okay, Louie?

08:28.884 --> 08:33.013
Singing to her is my favorite thing to do.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.933
But because of my leg, tonight I can't.

08:37.017 --> 08:42.397
So this is the saddest night ever.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.736
There must be something we can do.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.573
Putt, puff, puttedy ping.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.660
We've gotta get you to the field to sing.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.747
Great gears!

08:59.665 --> 09:00.791
Louie!

09:01.458 --> 09:04.169
Maybe you can bring that last sheep home.

09:04.253 --> 09:05.337
How?

09:08.841 --> 09:09.883
In this.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.888
I'll tow you to the pasture
so you can sing to the last sheep.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.725
Here you go.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.811
Nice and comfy.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.647
Otis, that's such a great idea.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.818
It's a bit tricky on my bad leg though.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.073
Thank you.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.408
I'm on board.

09:34.491 --> 09:38.161
Then come on, let's get rolling.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.414
We'll be right baa-ack.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.251
Otis, look.

09:44.334 --> 09:48.005
The sun's almost gone.
We have to find her. Quick!

09:51.842 --> 09:53.135
There she is!

09:55.095 --> 09:57.890
No, that's just flowers.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.642
Wait, I hear her.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.565
Is that another flower?

10:07.608 --> 10:08.650
Nope.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.777
There you are, sheep.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.988
We're here to bring you home.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.032
Are you ready, Louie?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.284
I am so ready, Otis.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.952
Let's do this.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.957
Fluffy sheep with snow-white wool

10:24.041 --> 10:26.627
The grassy fields they roam

10:26.710 --> 10:32.424
And it makes my heart feel very full
When I lead them all back home

10:35.093 --> 10:38.472
They'll chew and bleat and baa

10:39.181 --> 10:41.850
I'll be their guiding star

10:41.934 --> 10:46.063
And as I sing
My song will bring

10:46.146 --> 10:50.692
My flock home from afar

10:50.776 --> 10:54.029
You were right, Louie.
She loves your singing.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.990
And I love it too.

10:57.074 --> 11:00.911
It's my favorite part of the night.
I'm so happy I got to do it.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.498
Me too.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.799
And look at that!

11:13.882 --> 11:17.135
All one, two, three,

11:17.219 --> 11:20.848
four, five sheep are home for the night.

11:20.931 --> 11:24.434
What a baa-eautiful sight.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.894
We did it, Otis.

11:26.937 --> 11:30.107
That's 'cause on this farm,
we all help each other.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.451
"Daisy's High High Jump."

11:49.001 --> 11:50.377
Your turn, Otis!

11:52.087 --> 11:53.672
All right.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.884
Jump, Otis, jump!

11:57.551 --> 12:00.762
Here I go.

12:01.597 --> 12:03.056
Go, Otis, go!

12:06.101 --> 12:11.064
Did you see that?
I call it the Tractor Twist.

12:11.148 --> 12:14.401
What a moo-ove.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.527
My turn!

12:16.195 --> 12:18.572
And I think today's the day, Otis.

12:18.655 --> 12:21.533
I'm gonna do my highest jump ever.

12:22.409 --> 12:26.121
Wow! Daisy, what are these hoofprints?

12:26.663 --> 12:30.167
Every time I jump a little higher,
I add another hoofprint.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.128
See this one?
That's where I jumped last time.

12:33.212 --> 12:36.340
Today,
I wanna jump all the way to the top.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.893
Daisy, Daisy
You jump so high

12:47.976 --> 12:51.230
Someday soon
You'll touch the sky

12:51.980 --> 12:53.023
Here I go.

12:56.235 --> 12:58.070
Whoo-moo!

12:58.153 --> 12:59.321
Oops.

13:05.202 --> 13:06.411
So close.

13:08.872 --> 13:09.915
Try again.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.252
You got it, Otis.

13:13.335 --> 13:17.548
I'm not gonna let one miss stop me
from jumping my highest jump.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.055
Sweet Susie, what are you doing here?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.474
My horseshoes are a little worn-out,

13:27.558 --> 13:30.894
so the farmers are fitting me
for some shiny new ones.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.313
What are you two sugar cubes up to?

13:33.397 --> 13:35.899
I'm trying to jump my highest jump yet.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.528
Sounds sweet!

13:39.611 --> 13:41.321
Tell you what, little Daisy,

13:41.405 --> 13:45.534
I'll come back to see that amazing jump
after I get my new shoes.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.370
Really, really, really?

13:48.453 --> 13:49.580
You will?

13:49.663 --> 13:51.790
Yep. Keep at it, sweetie.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.292
See you two later.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.837
Did you hear that?

13:56.920 --> 14:01.675
My favorite jumper in the whole world
wants to see me jump my highest jump!

14:02.176 --> 14:04.928
I'm so excited, I could…

14:05.721 --> 14:06.972
jump!

14:07.055 --> 14:09.516
-You got this, Daisy.
-Yeah!

14:10.851 --> 14:12.519
Here I come.

14:13.145 --> 14:16.148
Daisy, Daisy
Ring that bell

14:19.234 --> 14:20.903
Hit the brakes.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.322
Daisy, are you okay?

14:24.281 --> 14:26.200
Yeah, I'm okay.

14:29.745 --> 14:30.871
Oh, no!

14:30.954 --> 14:32.164
It broke!

14:38.837 --> 14:41.006
My hurdle's ruined.

14:42.341 --> 14:46.011
Now I'll never get to show
Sweet Susie how high I can jump.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.598
I'm really disappointed.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.646
Maybe we can find
something else for you to jump over

14:55.729 --> 14:57.689
before Sweet Susie gets back.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.066
Like what?

14:59.942 --> 15:03.612
It's gotta be something that's as high
as the top of your hurdle.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.239
Let's get rolling.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.366
Okay, Otis.

15:13.747 --> 15:14.748
Celeste.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.376
My hurdle broke.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.294
Oh, no.

15:19.378 --> 15:21.755
Do you have anything Daisy can jump over?

15:21.839 --> 15:24.550
It needs to be super-duper tall.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.135
Let's see.

15:27.886 --> 15:32.349
What about this… milk pail?

15:36.019 --> 15:37.145
Thanks.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.649
But it needs to be a lot taller.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.737
How about now?

15:47.239 --> 15:48.490
Even taller.

15:50.117 --> 15:53.370
She's trying to jump
her highest jump ever.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.955
Higher than me.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.086
We're gonna need a lot more apples.

16:04.173 --> 16:06.049
Or more milk pails.

16:06.800 --> 16:11.346
Let's bring them over and stack them up.
They might be as high as your hurdle.

16:11.430 --> 16:13.348
-Let's try it.
-Oink-cellent!

16:18.187 --> 16:20.814
All righty. One pail.

16:21.523 --> 16:22.733
Two pails.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.945
This might take a while.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.033
We got this.

16:31.116 --> 16:35.370
Wow! Our pal's got a lot of pails.

16:41.585 --> 16:42.878
Oink-cellent.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.755
Just a little tractor trick.

16:46.965 --> 16:50.844
You're such a hearty helper, Otis.
Let's see if it's high enough.

16:54.473 --> 16:55.641
Not quite.

16:59.144 --> 17:01.563
Thanks to Celeste's apple, it is.

17:02.147 --> 17:03.607
Yes!

17:03.690 --> 17:05.067
Thanks, Otis.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.736
All right, Daisy, give it all you got.

17:12.907 --> 17:15.368
Here I go!

17:17.954 --> 17:19.080
There they are.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.376
-I need these pails to milk the cows.
-No!

17:28.131 --> 17:29.800
Hiya, Daisy.

17:30.968 --> 17:32.302
Oh, no!

17:33.971 --> 17:35.472
Hit the brakes.

17:36.849 --> 17:38.267
Are you okay, Daisy?

17:38.350 --> 17:40.686
What am I gonna jump over now?

17:41.812 --> 17:43.188
I'm so sad.

17:45.899 --> 17:49.319
We'll find something else.
Let's get rolling.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.947
-Whoo-moo!
-Oink-cellent!

17:55.909 --> 17:57.578
Yellow corn.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.999
Crunchy, yellow corn.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.300
What are you cock-a-doodle-doing
back here?

18:11.383 --> 18:14.970
Hey, Sal.
We're looking for something really tall.

18:15.053 --> 18:18.348
Daisy's trying to jump
her highest jump ever.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.226
Like this tall?

18:21.310 --> 18:22.394
Yeah!

18:25.772 --> 18:28.984
That's taller than any of this stuff,
that's for sure.

18:32.237 --> 18:37.159
Hey, little Daisy, just one more horseshoe
to go, then I can watch you jump.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.998
Oh, no! Sweet Susie's almost ready,

18:43.081 --> 18:45.417
but I don't have anything to jump over.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.130
Putt, puff, puttedy chuff.

18:50.214 --> 18:52.799
We'll help Daisy and won't give up.

18:55.177 --> 18:59.097
Daisy, your hurdle had
a bar that could move up and down, right?

19:03.268 --> 19:05.103
And it also had a bell?

19:05.187 --> 19:07.856
Yeah, it went, "ding"!

19:09.775 --> 19:11.818
Exactly like that.

19:11.902 --> 19:14.154
Great gears, I've got it!

19:14.238 --> 19:17.282
We can use all this stuff
to build you a new hurdle.

19:17.366 --> 19:19.535
Really? Can we?

19:19.618 --> 19:22.663
Yep. Grab that broom please, Daisy.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.082
Celeste, you can carry the fishing pole.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.460
And, Sal, get those wind chimes, please.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.004
Now let's get rolling.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.966
Let's cock-a-doodle-do this.

19:42.391 --> 19:44.226
Dig, dig, dig.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.728
Dig, Otis, dig.

19:57.406 --> 20:00.117
Hey, Sal, how are those wind chimes doing?

20:01.660 --> 20:04.454
I might have a little problem here.

20:06.331 --> 20:09.376
I know what you need. A Tractor Twist!

20:13.839 --> 20:15.966
-Terrific twist, Otis.
-Great moo-ove.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.634
That was fun.

20:17.718 --> 20:21.263
Okay, Sal, hang those chimes
from the fishing pole.

20:29.021 --> 20:31.231
Now you have a new hurdle.

20:31.315 --> 20:36.904
Otis, it's so amazing,
it makes me wanna moo!

20:36.987 --> 20:38.155
Oink-cellent!

20:38.238 --> 20:40.574
-We cock-a-doodle-did it.
-Wait!

20:42.534 --> 20:45.078
It's just missing one more thing.

20:45.871 --> 20:47.247
Another hoofprint.

20:47.748 --> 20:50.876
You think you can jump
your highest jump, Daisy?

20:50.959 --> 20:53.712
I'm gonna try my best!

20:53.795 --> 20:55.589
That's the spirit, Daisy!

20:56.173 --> 20:57.424
Sweet Susie!

20:57.508 --> 20:59.927
Let's see you soar, little Daisy!

21:00.969 --> 21:03.722
Come on, Daisy, you can do this.

21:08.393 --> 21:09.811
I can't watch.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.772
You got this, Daisy.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.441
I'm all aflutter.

21:15.025 --> 21:19.613
Here I go!

21:20.155 --> 21:22.783
Daisy, Daisy
You jump so high

21:22.866 --> 21:25.786
Someday soon
You'll touch the sky

21:25.869 --> 21:28.413
Give those chimes a great big ring!

21:28.497 --> 21:30.916
Whoo-moo!

21:33.585 --> 21:36.380
Jumping is my favorite thing!

21:37.339 --> 21:38.340
What a jump!

21:38.423 --> 21:41.218
-You did it!
-Did you see it? Did you see it?

21:41.301 --> 21:42.678
Sure did.

21:42.761 --> 21:45.264
I'm proud of you, Daisy darling.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.851
Me too! That was your highest jump ever!

21:50.602 --> 21:53.230
Now I get to make my highest
hoofprint ever.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.609
Watch this, Sweet Susie.

22:02.114 --> 22:04.575
-You did it, Daisy.
-Way to go, Daisy!

22:04.658 --> 22:06.034
Great job, Daisy.

22:06.869 --> 22:09.204
That was some sweet jumpin'.

22:10.247 --> 22:12.958
I'm so glad I had something to jump over.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.502
Thanks to my friends.

22:15.586 --> 22:18.463
On this farm, we all help each other.

22:18.547 --> 22:19.756
That's right.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.592
We sure cock-a-doodle-do.

22:22.176 --> 22:23.594
Your turn, Otis.

22:23.677 --> 22:27.389
Then me.
I gotta take these new shoes for a spin.

22:28.265 --> 22:30.893
-Go, Otis, go!
-Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo!

22:30.976 --> 22:34.771
-Get some air, Otis!
-Here I go. Tractor Twist.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.566
Hooray, Otis!
