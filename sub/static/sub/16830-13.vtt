00:00.289 --> 00:03.031
- Previously on "Conviction"...
- Rodney Landon?

00:03.203 --> 00:05.770
Being a hateful jackass isn't
grounds for four life sentences.

00:05.992 --> 00:09.444
But celebrating the 10th anniversary
of 9/11 by bombing a mosque is.

00:09.538 --> 00:12.164
My plan was to blow up a mosque,
not that mosque.

00:12.198 --> 00:13.999
The best way to defend this country

00:14.034 --> 00:17.536
is to eradicate all Muslims
before they eradicate us.

00:17.570 --> 00:20.539
But innocent or guilty,
Rodney Landon needs to stay in prison.

00:20.573 --> 00:23.008
A rumor started
that Landon was getting out

00:23.043 --> 00:24.476
for snitching on other inmates.

00:24.511 --> 00:26.412
A skinhead attacked him.

00:26.446 --> 00:28.380
Landon stabbed the guy with a shiv.

00:28.415 --> 00:30.682
He isn't getting out of prison
anytime soon.

00:30.717 --> 00:34.787
Bad guy stays off the street.
Sounds like a win to me.

00:36.589 --> 00:38.757
Mr. President.

00:38.792 --> 00:41.560
Part of what he loves about you
is that you're my daughter.

00:41.594 --> 00:43.562
You were raised in a political family,

00:43.596 --> 00:46.865
you have power, access,
all the things he never had.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.067
To us.

01:49.629 --> 01:52.831
You were up early this morning.

01:52.866 --> 01:54.733
Garbage trucks woke me.

01:54.767 --> 01:56.168
Figured I might as well
get a jump on things.

01:56.202 --> 01:57.169
New case?

01:57.203 --> 01:58.804
Not yet.

02:01.674 --> 02:03.142
- Hayes.
- Hmm?

02:03.176 --> 02:04.443
Everything okay?

02:06.679 --> 02:08.113
Yes.

02:10.683 --> 02:12.117
Mm.

02:16.523 --> 02:17.990
You remember when we first met?

02:18.024 --> 02:20.125
Of course.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.627
Why?

02:21.661 --> 02:22.995
Just wondering why you liked me.

02:23.029 --> 02:24.830
Too many reasons to count.

02:24.864 --> 02:26.131
I'd settle for top three.

02:27.133 --> 02:30.235
Smarts, attitude, beauty.

02:32.038 --> 02:33.105
I can continue.

02:33.139 --> 02:34.907
You'll tell me later.

02:36.009 --> 02:38.844
Ever since your dad left,
you've seemed a little...

02:38.878 --> 02:41.046
No. I'm good.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.648
Great, actually.

02:55.228 --> 02:56.728
Gerald Harris.

02:56.763 --> 02:58.730
Serving life for murdering
his wife, Claire.

02:58.765 --> 03:01.200
Where'd this case come from?
I don't remember logging it.

03:01.234 --> 03:02.167
Claire died after a fall

03:02.202 --> 03:04.036
from a second-story balcony
in their home.

03:04.070 --> 03:05.671
Prosecution claimed that she fell

03:05.705 --> 03:07.673
after a blow from the head
delivered by Gerald.

03:07.707 --> 03:09.074
Was there a problem with the forensics?

03:09.108 --> 03:10.576
Not that I'm aware of.

03:10.610 --> 03:14.079
No witnesses to the crime, so no
chance for witness misidentification.

03:14.113 --> 03:15.681
Right you are.

03:15.715 --> 03:17.015
So what's the issue with the conviction?

03:18.751 --> 03:21.520
Gerald's defense attorney
really screwed the pooch.

03:21.544 --> 03:23.598
_

03:25.391 --> 03:26.992
Criminal courthouse, fast as you can.

03:28.628 --> 03:30.374
Oh, uh, one stop on the way...

03:30.399 --> 03:32.164
Smithson's Dry Cleaner on Cicero.

03:38.238 --> 03:39.669
Kind of in a hurry.

03:39.694 --> 03:41.573
I wanted to say I had fun last night.

03:41.608 --> 03:43.075
That's sweet. Me, too.

03:43.109 --> 03:44.710
Maybe I could get your number.

03:44.744 --> 03:45.844
I'd like to see you again.

03:45.878 --> 03:48.747
It was fun, but not repeatbusiness fun.

03:48.781 --> 03:50.015
Move! Go!

03:50.984 --> 03:52.284
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

03:52.318 --> 03:55.887
my client, Gerald Harris,
devoted husband,

03:55.922 --> 03:58.056
woke up one morning last November

03:58.091 --> 04:00.025
to a terrible tragedy.

04:00.059 --> 04:05.764
His beloved wife, Claire, was dead."

04:05.798 --> 04:08.600
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury..."

04:11.938 --> 04:14.773
Testing my patience
on the first day, Ms. Morrison?

04:14.807 --> 04:15.974
Hardly seems prudent.

04:16.009 --> 04:17.776
Million apologies, Your Honor.

04:17.810 --> 04:18.877
Good morning, Gerald.

04:18.911 --> 04:21.178
Well...

04:25.351 --> 04:27.185
You're not ASA Rachel Johnson.

04:30.990 --> 04:33.392
Nothing gets by you.

04:33.426 --> 04:34.793
Conner Wallace.

04:34.827 --> 04:36.128
Rachel went into labor a month early.

04:36.162 --> 04:37.896
And I just thought she was fat.

04:39.299 --> 04:41.133
I'm a big fan of your father's.
He's a hero of mine.

04:41.167 --> 04:42.901
Well, that makes one of us.

04:42.935 --> 04:45.304
I hear you're the golden boy...
Mr. Undefeated.

04:45.338 --> 04:47.839
Don't get used to it.

04:47.874 --> 04:49.606
I'm gonna kick your ass.

04:51.211 --> 04:53.441

<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

05:01.220 --> 05:03.755
Wallace prosecuted this in Chicago.

05:03.790 --> 05:04.890
How is it even under our purview?

05:04.924 --> 05:07.092
Gerald was transferred
to Dannemora over a month ago

05:07.126 --> 05:08.927
so his mother could
continue to visit him.

05:08.961 --> 05:10.429
That makes him a ward of New York state

05:10.463 --> 05:12.798
and... and eligible for CIU review.

05:12.832 --> 05:15.100
The M.E. put Claire's
time of death at 4:30 a.m.

05:15.134 --> 05:18.837
Gerald didn't call 911 until
after he found her at 7:30 a.m.

05:18.871 --> 05:21.206
When the police and the paramedics
arrived at the house...

05:21.240 --> 05:23.675
...the defendant greeted them

05:23.710 --> 05:25.711
showered and dressed for the day.

05:25.745 --> 05:31.183
His pajamas, covered in Claire's blood,
were found in the washing machine.

05:31.217 --> 05:34.886
You'll hear from forensics
experts that there was blood...

05:34.921 --> 05:36.455
...on the bathroom sink and shower

05:36.489 --> 05:37.689
where Gerald had cleaned up.

05:37.724 --> 05:41.159
He was horrified. He didn't want Claire's
blood on him or what he was wearing.

05:41.184 --> 05:42.361
Your wife is dead...

05:42.395 --> 05:45.731
Who worries about appearances?

05:45.765 --> 05:46.832
The defendant does.

05:48.901 --> 05:51.136
He wanted out of his marriage,

05:51.170 --> 05:55.173
but a divorce would have been
unseemly and costly.

05:55.208 --> 05:57.175
And on the night of November 7th,

05:57.210 --> 05:59.745
his dissatisfaction with Claire
came to an ugly head.

05:59.779 --> 06:03.148
They argued, and like so many
victims of domestic violence...

06:03.182 --> 06:04.928
Objection! There is zero evidence

06:04.953 --> 06:07.018
that Claire Harris was
the victim of domestic abuse,

06:07.053 --> 06:08.854
and ASA Walbash knows it.

06:08.888 --> 06:10.222
Wallace.

06:10.256 --> 06:13.392
Sorry. Forgot.

06:13.426 --> 06:16.728
Sustained. Stick to the case, counselor.

06:19.298 --> 06:22.033
The evidence will show that this man

06:22.068 --> 06:24.503
brutally bashed
Claire on the back of the head,

06:24.537 --> 06:27.506
the force of that blow
sending her over the railing...

06:27.540 --> 06:30.375
...and down to the tiled floor
16 feet below.

06:30.410 --> 06:32.878
A blow to the back of the head
means someone hit her.

06:32.912 --> 06:34.413
Any other suspects besides the husband?

06:34.447 --> 06:36.381
The police found a set
of unidentified fingerprints

06:36.416 --> 06:38.383
inside the back door
of the Harris' house.

06:38.418 --> 06:40.218
There had been a series of burglaries...

06:40.253 --> 06:42.854
...in the Harris' neighborhood.

06:42.889 --> 06:45.524
Gerald and Claire
never locked their back door...

06:45.558 --> 06:47.392
the same back door

06:47.427 --> 06:49.261
where these mysterious
fingerprints were found.

06:49.295 --> 06:52.230
The evidence will show
that Claire was battling a cough

06:52.265 --> 06:53.298
at the time of her death.

06:53.332 --> 06:55.967
She got up so as not to wake Gerald

06:56.002 --> 06:58.236
only to be surprised by a burglar,

06:58.271 --> 07:01.440
who knocked her off
the balcony to her death.

07:01.474 --> 07:05.277
And yet, in a rush to judgment,

07:05.311 --> 07:09.981
the police set their sights on Gerald

07:10.016 --> 07:12.951
and failed to pursue
the obvious suspect.

07:12.985 --> 07:14.553
Claire's killer is still at large.

07:14.587 --> 07:18.089
You pitched an unknown, uncaught thief
as Claire's murderer?

07:18.124 --> 07:19.591
Basically, the one-armed man.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.293
Watch "The Fugitive"...
the one-armed man did it.

07:21.327 --> 07:23.929
So you argued Claire fought
with an intruder

07:23.963 --> 07:26.231
who knocked her off a 16-foot balcony,

07:26.265 --> 07:28.300
and Gerald slept
through the whole thing?

07:28.334 --> 07:30.235
Gerald had taken
a sleeping pill that night.

07:30.269 --> 07:32.337
Other than that theory,
what was your defense?

07:32.371 --> 07:34.306
Love.

07:34.340 --> 07:36.475
True love.

07:36.509 --> 07:39.144
That is what Claire and Gerald had.

07:39.178 --> 07:41.179
You will hear testimony
from their friends

07:41.214 --> 07:45.083
about their 15-year marriage,
his devotion to her,

07:45.117 --> 07:46.485
his adoration of her,

07:46.519 --> 07:48.487
their plans to spend the rest
of their lives together.

07:48.521 --> 07:51.089
It's enough of a tragedy
that Claire is gone.

07:51.123 --> 07:54.626
To accuse Gerald of killing her,

07:54.660 --> 07:57.596
the love of his life,

07:57.630 --> 08:00.432
doesn't fit the evidence.

08:00.466 --> 08:02.334
Simply not true.

08:36.235 --> 08:38.503
It's nice to see you, Gerald.

08:38.538 --> 08:40.005
Not sure I can say the same.

08:43.042 --> 08:45.677
I wanted to let you know
we're taking another look at your case.

08:45.711 --> 08:48.179
I've already exhausted all my appeals.

08:48.214 --> 08:50.415
Which were all based
on ineffective assistance of counsel.

08:50.449 --> 08:52.217
I know.

08:52.251 --> 08:53.552
I deserve that.

08:53.586 --> 08:56.388
As soon as that guilty verdict
came down, you bolted.

08:56.422 --> 08:58.323
You didn't return my calls, my letters.

08:58.357 --> 09:00.158
And I have regretted it ever since.

09:00.192 --> 09:02.394
Now I run the Conviction Integrity Unit.

09:02.428 --> 09:05.030
- We're gonna try...
- Do you believe I'm innocent?

09:07.066 --> 09:08.199
The whole trial,

09:08.234 --> 09:09.434
I never knew whether you believed me.

09:09.468 --> 09:11.336
Defense attorneys aren't
supposed to focus on that.

09:13.272 --> 09:15.340
But I have been thinking
about you and Claire,

09:15.374 --> 09:19.611
how much she meant to you,
how much you loved her.

09:19.645 --> 09:21.046
I believe you.

09:22.582 --> 09:24.549
Even if our marriage was... different?

09:25.585 --> 09:26.585
I like different.

09:26.619 --> 09:29.220
Hmm.

09:46.839 --> 09:48.273
I was surprised to hear from you.

09:48.307 --> 09:50.075
Last time we sat in this room,

09:50.109 --> 09:52.444
you told me you'd proven
I didn't bomb that mosque.

09:52.478 --> 09:54.646
And you made it clear you still
had a plan to kill thousands.

09:54.680 --> 09:57.148
That's debatable.

09:57.183 --> 09:59.084
Unlike my innocence of the bombing.

10:00.653 --> 10:03.555
And yet I'm still here,

10:03.589 --> 10:07.592
thanks to the ironically named
Conviction Integrity Unit.

10:07.627 --> 10:09.160
You're here because you got in a fight.

10:09.195 --> 10:10.295
I was attacked.

10:10.329 --> 10:12.163
- I defended myself.
- With a shiv.

10:12.198 --> 10:14.232
You stabbed your unarmed
assailant six times.

10:14.266 --> 10:16.635
The skinhead who jumped me,

10:16.669 --> 10:19.304
he has an interesting story about an ADA

10:19.338 --> 10:23.742
who told him I was getting released
early because I was a snitch.

10:23.776 --> 10:26.311
That's why he attacked me.

10:26.345 --> 10:28.113
My trial is this week.

10:28.147 --> 10:33.151
My lawyer will be putting that
charming Neo-Nazi on the stand,

10:33.185 --> 10:35.153
and he'll identify you as that ADA.

10:42.528 --> 10:44.195
Gerald Harris?

10:44.230 --> 10:46.331
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

10:46.365 --> 10:49.768
When I asked you this morning
about your next review,

10:49.802 --> 10:52.270
you didn't think to mention
that one to me?

10:52.304 --> 10:53.705
We agreed I get to pick my cases.

10:53.739 --> 10:56.174
Well, I don't care
if you review Gerald's case.

10:56.208 --> 10:57.342
Fine.

10:57.376 --> 10:58.476
Why did you lie to me?

11:00.513 --> 11:03.181
You've been distant
since your dad left town.

11:03.215 --> 11:05.684
- No, I haven't.
- Hayes.

11:05.718 --> 11:08.319
Tell me what's going on.

11:11.490 --> 11:15.393
My father said something... about us.

11:15.428 --> 11:17.362
The alpha-dog thing?

11:17.396 --> 11:18.463
You said you didn't care about that.

11:18.497 --> 11:21.032
Wasn't that.

11:23.836 --> 11:27.205
My father said...

11:27.239 --> 11:32.143
that part of the reason
why you care about me...

11:32.178 --> 11:36.414
is because of my family, my connections.

11:36.449 --> 11:37.682
That's ridiculous.

11:41.687 --> 11:44.022
But you believe him?

11:47.193 --> 11:49.461
I don't not believe him.

12:12.651 --> 12:13.685
You okay?

12:13.719 --> 12:14.786
You got something?

12:14.820 --> 12:16.688
I reached out to some cops in Chicago

12:16.722 --> 12:19.224
about burglaries
in Gerald's neighborhood.

12:19.258 --> 12:20.759
Scott Hill was arrested

12:20.793 --> 12:22.727
a year after Gerald's conviction.

12:22.762 --> 12:24.195
He was picked up with some items

12:24.230 --> 12:25.597
that were stolen
from houses near Gerald.

12:25.631 --> 12:26.564
Promising.

12:26.599 --> 12:28.399
He recently got out
after serving five years

12:28.434 --> 12:29.501
for residential burglary.

12:29.535 --> 12:31.736
And get this... when a homeowner
caught him in the act,

12:31.771 --> 12:34.739
he hit her over the head
with a table lamp.

12:34.774 --> 12:36.307
We may have found your one-armed man.

12:36.342 --> 12:39.110
And you're headed
to Chicago to find out.

12:46.003 --> 12:48.051
_

12:48.076 --> 12:49.786
You did two years
for breaking and entering

12:49.811 --> 12:51.345
and another three
for assault on a homeowner.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.613
Could have told you that over the phone.

12:52.647 --> 12:53.881
You didn't have to come all this way.

12:53.915 --> 12:55.582
What, and miss out
on Chicago in the winter?

12:57.452 --> 12:58.886
I got to get back to this.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.888
The woman you assaulted,
you hit her over the head.

13:00.922 --> 13:02.856
I was just trying to get out
without getting caught.

13:02.891 --> 13:03.924
I didn't mean to hurt her.

13:03.958 --> 13:05.826
What about Claire Harris?
You mean to hurt her?

13:06.956 --> 13:08.472
Who is that? I've never seen that woman.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.231
Maybe this will jog your memory.

13:11.933 --> 13:13.634
You mean the lady
that was killed by her husband?

13:13.668 --> 13:14.601
Maybe she wasn't killed by her husband.

13:14.636 --> 13:16.236
Maybe you did it
when you broke in the house.

13:16.271 --> 13:17.771
She woke up, she surprised you,

13:17.806 --> 13:19.606
you hit her over the head,
knocking her over the balcony.

13:19.641 --> 13:21.529
- No way. That wasn't me.
- The M.O.'s the same...

13:21.554 --> 13:24.388
female victim, blow to the head,
neighborhood you worked.

13:24.413 --> 13:26.914
I moved on from that area a week
or so before that lady died.

13:26.948 --> 13:28.849
Where were you the night
of November 7, 2008?

13:31.086 --> 13:32.152
Can't say for sure.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.654
Mm. Compelling.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.523
I'll see you in court for your
arraignment on murder charges.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.527
Wait.

13:43.231 --> 13:45.232
What's the statute
of limitations on burglary?

13:45.267 --> 13:46.800
Three years.

13:51.406 --> 13:53.540
That night, I robbed a big Greystone
in North Lawndale.

13:53.575 --> 13:55.542
Owners were out of town,

13:55.577 --> 13:57.144
they didn't cancel their paper or mail.

13:57.178 --> 13:59.546
I took a hell of a haul.

13:59.581 --> 14:00.814
I remember, because the next day,

14:00.849 --> 14:02.449
her being dead was on the news.

14:15.764 --> 14:17.865
I'm being subpoenaed to appear

14:17.899 --> 14:19.800
at Rodney Landon's assault trial.

14:21.536 --> 14:23.537
Landon was attacked by another inmate

14:23.571 --> 14:25.606
who heard he was a snitch.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.708
I guess we both know
who started that rumor.

14:30.312 --> 14:33.213
I never should've taken that case.

14:34.716 --> 14:36.583
Luckily, it'll be the
skinhead's word against yours,

14:36.618 --> 14:38.886
assuming that you spoke to him
in attorney visiting...

14:38.920 --> 14:39.887
You're suborning perjury.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.423
I am pointing out
that conversation was private.

14:42.457 --> 14:44.825
Only you and the man who attacked
Landon know what was said.

14:46.561 --> 14:47.761
I can't lie on the stand.

14:47.796 --> 14:50.731
- Now you're concerned about the rules?
- I don't regret what I did,

14:50.765 --> 14:52.599
and I'm willing to face the consequences

14:52.634 --> 14:55.269
because no matter what,
Landon is not getting out.

14:55.303 --> 14:57.027
He used an illegal weapon,
he fought well past the...

14:57.052 --> 14:59.606
If you tell the truth,
every single case we have worked on

14:59.641 --> 15:01.675
is guaranteed to be called
into question.

15:06.181 --> 15:09.650
- I'll take the fifth.
- You do that, you'll be disbarred.

15:09.684 --> 15:11.085
You'll be finished as a lawyer.

15:12.354 --> 15:13.754
I can live with that.

15:18.193 --> 15:19.693
Am I interrupting?

15:19.728 --> 15:21.695
No.

15:21.730 --> 15:23.230
What's up?

15:23.265 --> 15:25.232
Maxine checked out Scott Hill's alibi

15:25.267 --> 15:26.533
for the night Claire died.

15:26.568 --> 15:27.601
It holds up.

15:28.737 --> 15:30.638
My one-armed man is innocent.

15:32.374 --> 15:34.808
I was looking over
trial transcripts last night.

15:34.843 --> 15:36.644
Your mistake on Gerald's defense,

15:36.678 --> 15:39.179
was that letting
Claire's sister, Emma, testify?

15:40.248 --> 15:42.683
Objection!

15:45.720 --> 15:48.436
- This is clearly a Brady violation...
- It would be if I hadn't...

15:48.460 --> 15:50.037
Emma Johns doesn't appear
on the witness list.

15:50.038 --> 15:52.359
- She's a rebuttal witness.
- There was no notice or offer of proof.

15:52.394 --> 15:53.794
If Ms. Morrison would let me finish.

15:55.864 --> 15:57.114
I contacted her office.

15:57.139 --> 15:59.299
They informed me they'd been
unable to get ahold of her,

15:59.334 --> 16:02.669
so I e-mailed and faxed
for good measure.

16:12.881 --> 16:16.350
It appears you were given
adequate notice, Ms. Morrison.

16:16.384 --> 16:17.785
Are you prepared to proceed?

16:17.819 --> 16:20.355
One moment while I confer
with my client, Your Honor.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.226
Gerald, I'm sorry. I screwed up.

16:26.261 --> 16:27.861
I can try to fight for a mistrial.

16:27.896 --> 16:29.797
Does that mean we'd have to start over?

16:29.831 --> 16:31.832
It'd give me more time
to look into Emma,

16:31.866 --> 16:33.367
figure out what she's going to say.

16:33.401 --> 16:35.736
Nothing.

16:35.770 --> 16:39.373
They... They weren't close
and barely spoke in years.

16:39.407 --> 16:41.308
Are you sure about that?

16:41.342 --> 16:42.743
Yeah.

16:44.746 --> 16:45.813
Ms. Morrison?

16:48.616 --> 16:49.723
Ms. Morrison?

16:49.748 --> 16:52.324
Yes, Your Honor,
we're prepared to proceed.

16:58.359 --> 17:01.869
I'm sorry I stormed off yesterday.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.531
I was up all night last night

17:04.665 --> 17:07.040
thinking about what your father said...

17:08.470 --> 17:09.936
...and that he might be right.

17:09.971 --> 17:11.905
Wow. Okay.

17:11.940 --> 17:14.407
Hang on. Hear me out.

17:14.442 --> 17:16.577
I never met anyone like you
in my entire life.

17:16.611 --> 17:22.749
You're funny and smart
and tough as nails.

17:22.784 --> 17:24.417
And you're the president's daughter.

17:24.452 --> 17:28.789
I can't change that, and I never would

17:28.823 --> 17:33.760
because if I did,
that might somehow mess up

17:33.795 --> 17:36.530
the amazing alchemy that is you.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.802
And I love you.

17:47.809 --> 17:50.410
Well argued.

17:53.515 --> 17:56.450
We're not in court.

18:02.524 --> 18:04.925
How would you describe
your sister's marriage to Gerald Harris?

18:04.959 --> 18:05.993
Deeply troubled.

18:06.027 --> 18:08.795
Objection! Hearsay, foundation.

18:08.830 --> 18:10.797
Why not list the entire evidence code?

18:10.832 --> 18:12.933
Your Honor, this is the victim's sister.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.903
Who had no relationship with Claire
for years before her murder.

18:15.937 --> 18:18.105
Now defense counsel is testifying?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.307
- Move to strike.
- Sustained.

18:20.341 --> 18:22.476
The jury will ignore
Ms. Morrison's last comment.

18:22.510 --> 18:24.978
Mr. Wallace,
lay some foundation, please.

18:25.013 --> 18:26.780
How did you know

18:26.814 --> 18:28.482
Claire and Gerald's marriage
was struggling?

18:28.516 --> 18:30.651
Because Claire and I spoke
every couple of weeks.

18:30.685 --> 18:34.021
She didn't tell Gerald because
he and I didn't get along.

18:34.055 --> 18:36.823
In fact, a few years before she died,

18:36.858 --> 18:38.325
she mentioned wanting a divorce.

18:38.359 --> 18:39.626
- That's a lie.
- Your Honor.

18:39.653 --> 18:41.487
It's not true.
It never, ever got that far.

18:41.529 --> 18:43.630
Mr. Harris, no more outbursts!

18:43.665 --> 18:45.933
Ms. Morrison, control your client.

18:50.004 --> 18:53.840
Was there any particular reason
Claire was considering divorce?

18:55.910 --> 18:58.845
Gerald told her
that he was having sex with men.

19:00.582 --> 19:02.382
Objection! Hearsay.

19:02.417 --> 19:04.299
Goes to the victim's
state of mind, Your Honor.

19:04.324 --> 19:06.225
I'll allow it. Continue, please.

19:08.823 --> 19:10.891
He had been going to gay bars

19:10.925 --> 19:13.560
and having sex with strangers for years,

19:13.595 --> 19:15.162
and he planned on continuing it.

19:15.196 --> 19:18.799
He refused to commit to her exclusively,

19:18.833 --> 19:21.168
but he didn't want a divorce.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.637
Claire was devastated.

19:28.843 --> 19:30.577
How could you not have told me?!

19:30.612 --> 19:32.579
Because I didn't think it mattered.

19:32.614 --> 19:33.847
Claire and I were
the only ones who knew.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.816
Apparently not. How could it not matter?

19:35.850 --> 19:36.788
Because we had an understanding.

19:36.813 --> 19:38.311
That you had a free pass
to sleep with men.

19:38.335 --> 19:40.053
- Yes.
- Claire was really okay with this?

19:40.088 --> 19:41.491
Well, not at first.
That... That must have been

19:41.516 --> 19:43.553
when she told Emma about the divorce.

19:45.026 --> 19:46.560
The first 10 years

19:46.594 --> 19:48.061
that Claire and I were married,

19:48.096 --> 19:50.764
I suppressed my attraction
to men because I loved her.

19:50.798 --> 19:53.700
I thought it would go away,
but it didn't.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.569
How did Claire find out?

19:55.603 --> 19:56.703
I told her.

19:58.873 --> 20:00.774
I wanted her to know who I was.

20:16.691 --> 20:18.992
- Were you serious about any of them?
- No.

20:19.027 --> 20:20.527
A lot of them I only saw once.

20:20.562 --> 20:22.329
None of them ever came to my home.

20:22.363 --> 20:24.331
The jury really doesn't
like you right now, Gerald.

20:24.365 --> 20:25.532
Did you see their faces?

20:25.567 --> 20:27.367
Put me on the stand. I'll explain.

20:27.402 --> 20:29.002
I do that, and the prosecutor paints you

20:29.037 --> 20:31.838
as a sick, adultering deviant.

20:31.873 --> 20:34.975
He'll make you list every man you
slept with, have a field day.

20:35.009 --> 20:36.677
Why does any of this matter?

20:36.711 --> 20:39.046
I loved Claire.

20:39.080 --> 20:42.349
She saw me, and she loved me anyway.

20:48.890 --> 20:50.490
I love you, too.

21:02.730 --> 21:04.277
_

21:05.074 --> 21:07.269
All right, Walbash, let's talk deal.

21:07.294 --> 21:08.830
Why would I do that
when I'm headed for a win?

21:08.864 --> 21:09.965
You're not there yet.

21:09.999 --> 21:12.667
Please, the sister's testimony's
got you on the ropes.

21:12.702 --> 21:15.704
I'll admit
that homophobic smear campaign,

21:15.738 --> 21:17.372
uh, caught me a little off guard.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.808
You say smear campaign,
I say credible testimony.

21:19.842 --> 21:20.809
No deal.

21:28.551 --> 21:29.851
Juries are unpredictable.

21:29.885 --> 21:32.284
All you need is one juror
with a bisexual brother...

21:32.309 --> 21:34.356
- I'll take my chance.
- Okay.

21:35.458 --> 21:36.658
It's pretty arrogant, though.

21:36.692 --> 21:39.227
No, what's arrogant is you
pressuring me into a deal after...

21:40.995 --> 21:42.163
Never mind.

21:42.198 --> 21:44.266
What? Made a habit of staying out late?

21:44.300 --> 21:45.901
Showed up unprepared
for your hate-baiting attack?

21:45.935 --> 21:46.902
I was trying to be polite.

21:46.936 --> 21:48.270
- I hate polite.
- Good to know.

21:51.741 --> 21:53.608
You're a pain in the ass.

21:53.643 --> 21:55.377
And smart.

21:56.779 --> 21:58.780
And jaw-droppingly sexy.

22:20.703 --> 22:23.271
Listen, that was...

22:23.306 --> 22:25.173
The most fun you've ever had
in an elevator?

22:25.207 --> 22:26.641
- Yeah.
- Mm.

22:29.979 --> 22:33.281
But I still have to say no to a deal.

22:35.184 --> 22:36.818
You think I had sex with you for a deal?

22:37.954 --> 22:40.822
I screwed you because
I wanted to screw you,

22:40.856 --> 22:43.858
because you're kind of hot
in a freckly, Irish way.

22:43.893 --> 22:46.361
And obviously, you were into me, too.

22:46.395 --> 22:48.797
If I win or lose this case,
it'll be on my own merits,

22:48.831 --> 22:50.498
which are really damn good.

22:53.743 --> 22:56.311
Even if Wallace wouldn't make a deal,
you could've asked for a continuance.

22:56.336 --> 22:57.405
It was denied.

22:57.430 --> 22:59.140
I couldn't prove
that Claire had made peace

22:59.164 --> 23:00.904
with Gerald's extracurricular activities.

23:00.929 --> 23:02.344
But now we have time

23:02.378 --> 23:05.313
and a whole new pool of suspects.

23:06.248 --> 23:07.482
These are the men he slept with?

23:07.516 --> 23:08.450
Gerald took instant photos

23:08.484 --> 23:10.218
so he'd have something
to remember them by.

23:10.252 --> 23:12.387
Without having the photos
go up to the Cloud

23:12.421 --> 23:14.322
and end up on every computer he owned.

23:14.357 --> 23:16.825
- We know their names?
- Only the ones Gerald wrote down.

23:16.859 --> 23:18.893
They're all first names.
Who knows if they're real.

23:18.928 --> 23:21.088
I was thinking we could put these
through facial recognition.

23:21.113 --> 23:24.699
It might work, but I think
I got a better, faster idea.

23:24.734 --> 23:26.968
Somebody takes a picture of you,
what's the first thing you do?

23:27.003 --> 23:29.704
- Look at it.
- Which almost always means you touch it.

23:29.739 --> 23:31.539
I'll run the fingerprints on the photos.

23:31.574 --> 23:32.907
You get any hits on the database,

23:32.942 --> 23:34.509
call the names in to Maxine.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.311
If they're still in Chicago,
she can check them out.

23:48.691 --> 23:50.255
This is a nice surprise.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.926
I wish I could say the same about this.

23:51.961 --> 23:53.728
Came to my offices.

23:53.763 --> 23:56.998
It's a subpoena for Sam to
appear at Rodney Landon's trial.

23:57.033 --> 23:58.449
When were you gonna loop me in on this?

23:58.474 --> 24:00.535
When I could tell you
it wasn't gonna be a problem.

24:00.569 --> 24:01.703
Are the allegations true?

24:01.737 --> 24:03.505
Did Sam incite an attack on Landon?

24:03.539 --> 24:04.906
He was trying to keep Landon in prison.

24:04.940 --> 24:06.541
The man is a dangerous psychopath.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.043
And this could be the beginning
of the end of this unit.

24:08.077 --> 24:10.578
- Don't exaggerate.
- Have you spoken to Sam?

24:10.613 --> 24:13.848
- What does he plan to say?
- He's going to take the fifth.

24:15.084 --> 24:16.684
He was trying to protect CIU.

24:16.719 --> 24:19.117
All that will do is draw attention
to the existence of wrongdoing.

24:19.142 --> 24:21.556
- Who's the judge on the case?
- Malcolm Shore.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.893
I could drop the assault charges against
Landon as the District Attorney...

24:24.927 --> 24:26.361
And set Landon free

24:26.395 --> 24:28.563
while opening yourself up to another
investigation by the U.S. Attorney?

24:28.597 --> 24:30.598
What am I supposed to do, Hayes?

24:30.633 --> 24:33.935
Do nothing while Sam takes down
you, me, this entire unit?

24:33.969 --> 24:36.071
I'll handle it.

24:36.105 --> 24:38.473
Trust me. I have an idea.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.214
_

25:08.843 --> 25:10.543
I-I didn't order this.

25:10.578 --> 25:12.011
They're from her.

25:16.951 --> 25:18.918
Hello, Judge.

25:18.953 --> 25:19.980
I can't accept these.

25:20.005 --> 25:21.755
I know. They're for me.

25:21.789 --> 25:25.859
A few things you should know
about Rodney Landon.

25:30.131 --> 25:33.066
Hey. We got a hit on the set
of prints from the photos.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.100
This is Paul Lund.

25:34.135 --> 25:35.201
He was in the Army.

25:35.236 --> 25:37.851
Stationed in Fort Arlington
just outside of Chicago.

25:37.952 --> 25:40.073
- History of violence?
- None. Never been arrested.

25:40.107 --> 25:42.942
His fingerprints were put into AFIS
when he started coaching youth hockey.

25:42.977 --> 25:44.144
What are you so excited about?

25:44.178 --> 25:45.664
That we have the name of one
of the guys that Gerald screwed?

25:45.689 --> 25:48.648
Well, you said Gerald never took
any of these men home, right?

25:48.683 --> 25:51.584
Paul Lund's prints weren't just
on the photos Gerald took of him.

25:51.619 --> 25:53.486
I also ran them against
the unidentified prints

25:53.521 --> 25:54.621
the cops found at his back door.

25:54.655 --> 25:55.622
They're a match.

25:55.656 --> 25:57.624
I talked to Gerald.

25:57.658 --> 25:59.492
He insists he never invited
Paul Lund home

25:59.527 --> 26:00.627
or told him where he lived.

26:00.661 --> 26:02.095
Lund must have followed Gerald home

26:02.129 --> 26:03.263
after one of their hook-ups.

26:03.297 --> 26:04.998
Sounds like Gerald found a stalker.

26:05.032 --> 26:06.933
Which is still a long way from murder.

26:06.967 --> 26:08.902
Maxine is tracking Lund down in Chicago.

26:08.936 --> 26:10.236
It'll be easier to get a confession

26:10.271 --> 26:13.106
if we had more evidence as to what
happened after he got into the house.

26:13.140 --> 26:14.741
Did you find anything that tells us

26:14.775 --> 26:16.276
- what the weapon could be?
- No, not yet.

26:16.310 --> 26:18.878
Would it help to have
the victim's actual body?

26:20.583 --> 26:22.615
Are you suggesting we exhume Claire?

26:22.650 --> 26:25.752
A 3-D MRI
of her skull fracture and wounds

26:25.786 --> 26:27.253
would give me a hell of a lot more info

26:27.288 --> 26:28.655
on the shape of the weapon.

26:28.689 --> 26:29.956
Even after eight years in the ground?

26:29.990 --> 26:32.826
Forensics investigators
exhumed King Tut's body

26:32.860 --> 26:34.027
and figured out how he died,

26:34.061 --> 26:35.762
and that was after thousands of years.

26:35.796 --> 26:37.130
Yeah, but Tut's family wasn't around

26:37.164 --> 26:39.866
to fight digging him up.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.668
Maxine's headed to see Paul Lund.

26:41.702 --> 26:43.937
Claire's sister lives in New York now.

26:43.971 --> 26:45.572
I'll try and talk her
into the exhumation.

26:49.043 --> 26:50.844
We need another look at Claire's body.

26:50.878 --> 26:53.012
There was an autopsy. There was a trial.

26:53.047 --> 26:55.014
There are X-ray and MRI techniques

26:55.049 --> 26:56.282
that weren't available...

26:56.317 --> 26:58.017
After all this time,
you still don't care

26:58.052 --> 26:59.185
what Gerald did to my sister.

26:59.220 --> 27:01.187
If the exhumation proves
Gerald killed her,

27:01.222 --> 27:02.522
he should stay in prison.

27:02.556 --> 27:04.023
Gerald broke my sister's heart.

27:04.058 --> 27:05.959
That is the truth
whether you believe it or not.

27:05.993 --> 27:06.993
She told me.

27:07.027 --> 27:08.828
When, exactly?

27:10.030 --> 27:11.531
Three years before she died.

27:11.565 --> 27:14.033
Right after Gerald told her
he was seeing other men?

27:16.070 --> 27:17.971
Isn't it possible that Claire was hurt

27:18.005 --> 27:19.706
but eventually came to accept it?

27:24.011 --> 27:26.746
They had something special,
her and Gerald.

27:26.781 --> 27:27.547
Always laughing,

27:27.581 --> 27:30.984
always excited to see each other.

27:31.018 --> 27:35.221
I just thought she should've
been enough for him.

27:35.256 --> 27:36.890
Claire deserved that.

27:36.924 --> 27:39.626
What she deserves now is the truth.

27:44.198 --> 27:45.532
Help me find it.

27:52.373 --> 27:54.374
The reason Gerald didn't know
I was in his house

27:54.408 --> 27:55.909
is because his wife let me in.

27:55.943 --> 27:57.544
His wife, Claire? This woman here?

27:59.313 --> 28:00.480
Yeah.

28:00.514 --> 28:01.581
Did Gerald invite you over?

28:01.615 --> 28:03.116
No, I had followed him home once.

28:03.150 --> 28:04.751
I wanted to see where he lived.

28:04.785 --> 28:06.453
Well, you're not too big
on boundaries, huh, Paul?

28:08.022 --> 28:10.824
I was in a dark place back then.

28:10.858 --> 28:12.992
I was closeted, depressed.

28:13.027 --> 28:15.829
Being gay in the military
during "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"

28:15.863 --> 28:17.764
will do that to you.

28:17.798 --> 28:22.702
So, one day, when I passed by,
I just knocked on the door.

28:22.737 --> 28:23.703
Claire answered.

28:23.738 --> 28:24.671
Did she know who you were?

28:24.705 --> 28:27.006
I just told her
I was a friend of Gerald's,

28:27.041 --> 28:28.508
that we had met through work.

28:28.542 --> 28:30.610
She invited me in.

28:30.644 --> 28:31.811
Gave me a cup of coffee.

28:31.846 --> 28:32.946
And you said yes?

28:32.980 --> 28:35.682
I was very lonely.

28:35.716 --> 28:37.283
I just was glad
to have someone to talk to,

28:37.318 --> 28:38.952
and I think she sensed I needed that.

28:38.986 --> 28:40.620
Did Claire ever have
any idea of the real nature

28:40.654 --> 28:41.755
of your relationship with Gerald?

28:41.789 --> 28:45.024
I made up some stupid story
about how he and I had met,

28:45.059 --> 28:46.626
and she just smiled and asked

28:46.660 --> 28:48.328
if it was difficult
being in the military,

28:48.362 --> 28:51.030
being so discreet all the time.

28:51.065 --> 28:53.566
She was very kind.

28:53.601 --> 28:56.736
I got to say, Paul,
your story's really hard to believe.

28:56.771 --> 28:58.838
Well...

28:58.873 --> 29:00.006
it's the truth.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.808
I still have to ask where you were

29:01.842 --> 29:04.144
the night of November 7, 2008.

29:10.684 --> 29:11.818
Emma signed the exhumation papers,

29:11.852 --> 29:13.720
but Claire's body won't be
in New York until tomorrow.

29:13.754 --> 29:15.889
Still, that's great news.

29:15.923 --> 29:18.024
You know what's better?

29:18.058 --> 29:20.193
My subpoena was dismissed.

29:20.227 --> 29:22.095
I wonder what happened there.

29:22.129 --> 29:23.997
Judge Shore took it upon himself
to advise the victim

29:24.031 --> 29:26.065
on his rights against
self-incrimination.

29:27.768 --> 29:29.235
The skinhead decided not to testify,

29:29.270 --> 29:31.838
which means I didn't need
to take the stand.

29:33.870 --> 29:35.751
You have any idea
what they're talking about?

29:35.776 --> 29:36.869
Not a clue.

29:36.894 --> 29:38.912
Welcome back.

29:38.946 --> 29:40.246
I came straight from the airport.

29:40.281 --> 29:42.615
Would you like the good news or the bad?

29:42.650 --> 29:44.511
- Good.
- Paul Lund confirmed

29:44.536 --> 29:47.253
that Claire knew Gerald was sleeping
with men and was okay with it.

29:47.288 --> 29:48.288
So what's the bad news?

29:48.322 --> 29:49.923
Paul's military base confirmed

29:49.957 --> 29:53.059
he was on duty the night
that Claire was murdered.

29:53.093 --> 29:56.763
So the only suspect we have
besides Gerald has a solid alibi.

30:05.603 --> 30:07.048
_

30:08.550 --> 30:09.984
You were up early this morning.

30:10.018 --> 30:13.287
Had a breakfast meeting.
I didn't want to wake you.

30:20.131 --> 30:22.647
This is where I usually
ask you for an update.

30:22.896 --> 30:25.731
Our only alternative suspect
in Claire's murder

30:25.756 --> 30:27.692
has a solid alibi,
but I'm not giving up.

30:27.717 --> 30:29.470
Of course. What's next?

30:29.504 --> 30:31.005
Frankie had an idea.

30:31.039 --> 30:33.007
He's running biomechanical experiments

30:33.041 --> 30:35.976
to see if Claire's head wound
was caused by the impact

30:36.011 --> 30:37.288
or occurred during the fall.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.980
Which could mean her death was an
accident as opposed to a murder?

30:40.015 --> 30:41.148
Exactly.

30:41.182 --> 30:42.783
Claire landed facedown.

30:42.817 --> 30:44.518
She didn't hit anything during the fall.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.887
How else could she have gotten
a gash on the back of her head?

30:46.921 --> 30:49.623
Well, maybe the examination
of Claire's body

30:49.658 --> 30:51.725
will turn up something.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.561
Sam's subpoena got dismissed.

30:54.596 --> 30:56.697
I heard. Well done.

30:56.731 --> 30:58.365
Crisis averted.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.867
Short-term.

31:01.703 --> 31:05.038
This will be Sam's last case
with the CIU.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.809
- That makes no sense.
- He went rogue.

31:08.843 --> 31:10.010
He did what he thought was right.

31:10.045 --> 31:12.220
Because he didn't like
how a case turned out.

31:12.245 --> 31:13.380
It's my fault.

31:13.415 --> 31:15.749
I forced the team to review
Landon's conviction.

31:15.784 --> 31:19.386
Sam's a liability to the CIU.
This is not up for debate.

31:19.421 --> 31:21.522
Once Gerald's case is over, fire him.

31:23.558 --> 31:25.993
Or I will.

31:26.027 --> 31:29.563
My team, my responsibility.

31:31.466 --> 31:34.134
I'll do it.

31:39.850 --> 31:41.459
These sensors register

31:41.484 --> 31:43.884
the damage to the back
of the head and skull

31:43.912 --> 31:44.990
caused by the fall,

31:45.015 --> 31:47.281
and displayed here
where we compare it to this.

31:47.315 --> 31:49.490
We're seeing if we can
cause that type of wound

31:49.515 --> 31:50.583
without a blow to the head.

31:50.608 --> 31:52.743
And if Claire's body landed
in the right position.

31:52.768 --> 31:54.569
You ready?

32:05.700 --> 32:07.100
My bad.

32:19.747 --> 32:21.915
Make no mistake,
the defendant killed his wife.

32:21.950 --> 32:26.653
Defense counsel has dazzled you
with her charm and stories

32:26.688 --> 32:29.756
about a rash of unsolved break-ins,

32:29.791 --> 32:32.326
a mysterious unnamed assailant

32:32.360 --> 32:35.729
who they say killed Claire Harris.

32:35.763 --> 32:38.098
The truth is much simpler.

32:38.132 --> 32:40.067
The defendant murdered his wife

32:40.101 --> 32:43.337
because she got tired of his
infidelities with other men.

32:43.371 --> 32:46.273
They fought, he hit her over the head,

32:46.307 --> 32:48.008
knocking her off the balcony...

32:52.947 --> 32:54.715
...to her death.

32:54.749 --> 32:56.850
And then he changed
out of his bloody pajamas,

32:56.885 --> 32:58.886
showered, cleaned up,

32:58.920 --> 33:00.954
and waited to call the police.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.769
There is no mystery,
no uncaught intruder.

33:15.803 --> 33:18.405
Just the oldest story in the book...

33:18.439 --> 33:20.574
cold-blooded murder.

33:22.744 --> 33:24.711
You know what? Hang on a minute.

33:32.754 --> 33:34.755
Facedown.

33:36.991 --> 33:40.260
That would explain the blow
to the back of Claire's head.

33:40.295 --> 33:45.265
But how do you trip and fall
backwards off a balcony?

33:45.300 --> 33:48.302
It doesn't seem like an accident.

33:48.336 --> 33:50.170
M.E.'s office just called.

33:50.204 --> 33:52.806
They got Claire's body.

33:55.279 --> 33:57.320
When I look at Gerald,

33:57.345 --> 33:59.413
I see a man who loved his wife, Claire.

34:01.282 --> 34:05.152
41-year-old female,
interred December 12, 2008.

34:05.186 --> 34:06.253
Everything I said

34:06.287 --> 34:09.156
in my opening statements
about true love still holds.

34:09.190 --> 34:12.125
Claire and Gerald's romance
may not have been traditional,

34:12.159 --> 34:13.960
but it was no less true.

34:13.995 --> 34:15.929
And being different isn't a crime.

34:15.964 --> 34:17.364
Mortician did good work...

34:17.398 --> 34:19.299
nice embalming, minimal decomposition.

34:19.333 --> 34:21.168
What are those bruises on her neck?

34:25.005 --> 34:27.306
They weren't there during the autopsy.

34:27.342 --> 34:29.676
Was Gerald's life shattered
the day Claire died?

34:29.710 --> 34:31.344
No doubt.

34:31.379 --> 34:33.813
Was he incredibly devoted to her?

34:33.848 --> 34:34.848
No doubt.

34:36.384 --> 34:39.018
Did he love her unconditionally?

34:39.053 --> 34:41.788
No doubt.

34:41.822 --> 34:44.291
But as to who ended
Claire's life that night,

34:44.324 --> 34:46.059
there is no shortage of doubt.

34:46.094 --> 34:47.860
At the time of the autopsy,

34:47.895 --> 34:50.163
there were only a tiny few
pinpoint bruises.

34:50.197 --> 34:50.998
Where do they come from?

34:51.032 --> 34:52.099
Bruising stops when the heart stops,

34:52.132 --> 34:54.868
when the blood's not pumping
through the body anymore.

34:54.902 --> 34:58.038
Uh, the embalming fluid creates
a false circulation,

34:58.072 --> 34:59.973
bringing these bruises to the surface.

35:00.008 --> 35:03.210
Prosecution simply failed to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt

35:03.244 --> 35:07.514
that Gerald Harris killed
his beloved wife, Claire.

35:07.548 --> 35:10.017
And so you must find him not guilty.

35:19.093 --> 35:21.028
This could've happened before the fall.

35:24.065 --> 35:25.532
Classic signs of strangulation.

35:25.566 --> 35:28.068
So this wasn't an accident.

35:28.102 --> 35:31.304
Gerald strangled her
and pushed her off the balcony.

35:35.906 --> 35:38.125
- Strangulation.
- That's what the bruises suggest.

35:38.173 --> 35:40.030
And since we can't place
anybody else besides Gerald

35:40.055 --> 35:41.585
in the house with Claire that night...

35:41.610 --> 35:43.911
Hitting Claire over the head
during an argument is one thing,

35:43.946 --> 35:45.519
but to choke the life out of her...

35:45.544 --> 35:47.014
People who love each other fight.

35:47.049 --> 35:48.482
- Maybe...
- No.

35:50.285 --> 35:52.787
We're not going there. Half day left.

35:52.821 --> 35:55.456
Let's look for evidence in
support of Gerald's innocence.

35:59.695 --> 36:01.862
Okay, so, if Claire was strangled,

36:01.897 --> 36:03.531
wouldn't there be signs of a struggle?

36:03.565 --> 36:05.933
Maybe skin under her fingernails?

36:05.968 --> 36:07.668
Any way the fall could cause
bruising on her neck?

36:07.703 --> 36:09.103
No, that's pretty unlikely.

36:09.137 --> 36:11.272
Lack of bone fractures
or breaks in her neck.

36:11.306 --> 36:13.274
Doesn't rule out strangulation.

36:13.308 --> 36:16.010
Autopsy found extensive skull damage,

36:16.044 --> 36:17.678
obviously from the fall.

36:17.713 --> 36:19.880
Little bit of fluid in her lungs
makes sense,

36:19.915 --> 36:21.248
given that she had a cough.

36:24.353 --> 36:25.528
Okay, a cough...

36:25.553 --> 36:27.822
that's your theory
why she got up that night.

36:27.856 --> 36:29.991
That's significant because...?

36:31.444 --> 36:32.744
I got to go see the M.E.

36:32.794 --> 36:35.396
If you're right,

36:35.430 --> 36:38.132
this would be the ultimate
needle in a haystack.

36:38.166 --> 36:40.901
Claire Harris' aorta.

36:43.171 --> 36:44.972
What made you think of this?

36:45.006 --> 36:47.308
The petechial bruises.

36:47.342 --> 36:48.843
And she had a cough
at the time of her death.

36:48.877 --> 36:50.745
Well, that could have started
the dissection.

36:50.779 --> 36:52.346
Inner lining of the aorta comes loose...

36:52.380 --> 36:53.247
Blood flows under it,

36:53.281 --> 36:54.982
forming a bubble that blocks the artery,

36:55.016 --> 36:57.118
causing a virtually
undetectable heart attack.

36:57.152 --> 36:59.854
Her chest pain would've been massive.

36:59.888 --> 37:01.422
She could've staggered backwards,

37:01.456 --> 37:03.324
flipping over the railing,
hit her head...

37:03.358 --> 37:07.361
Claire might have been dead
before she even reached the ground.

37:07.495 --> 37:09.930
You see that small tear,

37:09.965 --> 37:11.891
like, um, a little pantyhose run?

37:11.916 --> 37:13.033
Yeah, yeah.

37:13.068 --> 37:14.468
The original M.E. missed it...

37:14.502 --> 37:17.037
so would anyone if they didn't
think to look for it.

37:17.072 --> 37:19.974
Spontaneous coronary aortic dissection.

37:20.008 --> 37:23.244
Her heart was a ticking time bomb.

37:23.278 --> 37:25.212
Gerald's innocent.

37:40.996 --> 37:43.430
I'm sorry this took so long.

37:43.465 --> 37:45.199
Better late than never.

37:49.204 --> 37:51.472
I had help. My team is amazing.

37:51.506 --> 37:53.173
Yeah.

37:53.208 --> 37:55.409
Their leader is all right, too.

38:19.877 --> 38:21.006
You okay?

38:22.537 --> 38:24.889
No. Disappointed.

38:26.007 --> 38:27.341
I promised you an ass-kicking in court.

38:27.375 --> 38:30.110
- Next time.
- Sure.

38:32.147 --> 38:33.847
Wait.

38:38.086 --> 38:39.853
Would you want to go out with me?

38:41.890 --> 38:43.357
Like, on a date?

38:44.559 --> 38:46.627
So, what, like, dinner and drinks?

38:46.661 --> 38:47.895
Maybe some sex.

38:47.929 --> 38:49.964
You mean like normal people?

38:49.998 --> 38:51.966
Sure. Like normal people.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.034
I hate normal.

38:54.069 --> 38:55.336
I like to stir the pot,

38:55.370 --> 38:57.104
fight the power, stick it to the man.

38:57.138 --> 38:58.238
Dinner first?

39:17.392 --> 39:18.459
I'm sorry.

39:18.493 --> 39:21.528
About what? Gerald's a free man.

39:21.563 --> 39:24.932
You're a... a liability.

39:32.574 --> 39:34.074
I understand.

39:36.578 --> 39:40.347
It's the right thing for the unit.

39:41.716 --> 39:44.184
If I were Wallace,
I'd do the same thing.

39:55.530 --> 39:56.497
What the hell was that?

39:56.531 --> 39:59.166
You've been sexually harassed
by your boss...

39:59.200 --> 40:01.402
in front of a witness.

40:03.471 --> 40:05.906
No one's firing you now.

40:21.122 --> 40:23.390
See you tomorrow, Sam.

40:36.171 --> 40:39.339
Sorry.
