04:17.341 --> 04:20.844
Good evening, gentlemen.
Can I check your hats, please?

04:24.473 --> 04:25.807
Gentlemen?

04:25.808 --> 04:27.309
Gentlemen.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.858
Got caught like a bear trap.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.152
You want to play or do you
want to pay? I got a great girl.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.988
Jack Flynn?

04:42.116 --> 04:45.076
Here you go, buddy.
Buy yourself a good time.

04:46.704 --> 04:49.580
- They'll let anybody in here.
- Mr. Flynn, I'm Maxwell Hoover.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.874
I'm with the Los Angeles
Police Department.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.127
That means I get change back.

04:56.922 --> 05:00.425
Are you still here?
What is it gonna cost me?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.427
I came here to deliver a message.

05:02.428 --> 05:05.263
Your presence is required
back in Chicago.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.849
It's cold in Chicago,
which is why I came out here.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.143
Is Mr. Flynn being
charged with a crime?

05:10.144 --> 05:11.894
What are you, his lawyer?

05:11.895 --> 05:14.397
No, but I'm represented
by a good one.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.359
What's my friend being charged with?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.736
He did things in Chicago.

05:19.737 --> 05:22.405
I beat all that, pal.
I beat those indictments.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.454
Jimmy, hit him in the nuts!

05:32.624 --> 05:34.000
Let's go. Get him outta here.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.378
You guys are making a big mistake.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.223
Where are we going?

05:48.891 --> 05:50.767
The airport.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.979
You're going to the airport, Jack.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.774
You gotta get back to Chicago
as soon as possible.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.278
This ain't the way to the airport.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.295
This is it.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.423
Yeah. This is it.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.301
This is what?

06:25.135 --> 06:27.637
This is Mulholland Falls, Jack.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.973
Mulholland Falls?

06:30.933 --> 06:33.810
It's kind of like Niagara Falls.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.857
Come on! There ain't no falls in L.A.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.911
You guys can't do this.
This is America.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.705
This isn't America, Jack.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.499
This is L.A.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.760
I thought we weren't
gonna do this anymore.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.762
- Do what?
- This.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.973
Come on, let's go.

07:27.156 --> 07:28.865
Jack?

07:32.536 --> 07:33.703
Maybe he's dead.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.705
He's not dead,
he's looking right at us.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.916
Jack, are you dead?

07:38.500 --> 07:39.792
He's alive.

07:39.793 --> 07:44.297
Now, Jack, we don't have
organized crime in L.A.,

07:44.298 --> 07:48.218
and frankly, we don't
want organized crime.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.719
So here's what I want you to do.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.888
I want you to look around

07:52.347 --> 07:54.474
and remember this

07:54.475 --> 07:58.520
because this will always be
your way back to Chicago.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.899
Mulholland Falls.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.715
Lee.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.384
Now, that's a thought.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.511
- Hey, Max.
- Kate.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.472
- Lili.
- Hi.

08:35.474 --> 08:38.351
We were just discussing husbands.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.602
I'm trying to find
a new one for Lili.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.104
- Do you know any?
- Jeez, Lili.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.440
Only guys I know are
cops and bad guys.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.983
Thanks, Pete.

08:45.984 --> 08:49.112
And I don't know if I can
recommend either one.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.990
How about Eddie Hall?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.284
- Eddie Hall?
- Yeah.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.203
Eddie Hall. No.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.955
He's been married five times.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.583
- You see what I mean?
- Yeah.

09:01.667 --> 09:05.962
I'm sorry I was late, Kate, but we
had a little accident up in the hills.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.134
No, no, no, Kate.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.512
You know I got two flat feet.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.389
Come on.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.641
Excuse us, Lili.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.743
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.201
- You the foreman?
- Yeah.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.078
Where are we out here? What is this?

10:21.079 --> 10:23.414
We're in a new housing subdivision.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.709
You ever think about who those people
are that are gonna live way out here?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.044
No.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.796
Me, neither.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.382
All right, guys,
I'll take it from here.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.678
- No pictures till I tell ya.
- Whatever you say.

10:43.435 --> 10:44.727
Hey, Doc.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.272
Max, I should've stayed in bed.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.690
Are you in charge of this operation?

10:49.691 --> 10:51.359
Yeah, this part I am.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.277
You got any heavy
equipment around here

10:53.278 --> 10:56.239
that could press a woman
into the ground like that?

10:57.282 --> 10:59.116
A big roller maybe.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.369
Seems like that would've
chewed her up more.

11:01.370 --> 11:04.038
- Is this the way you found her?
- Yeah. We didn't touch it.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.249
Yeah, she was just like this.

11:06.625 --> 11:10.545
Why don't you step over there,
an officer will take your full statement.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.342
Jesus, Milt.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.636
There's nothing to hold on to.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.055
Okay,

11:21.264 --> 11:24.434
roll her over and see
what she looks like.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.653
Jesus.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.953
- You okay, Max?
- Yeah.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.628
Step aside, boys.
Let me get a couple.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.925
Jeez, what a mess.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.637
- Check under her fingernails.
- Okay.

12:01.638 --> 12:02.972
How'd she die?

12:02.973 --> 12:05.350
It's like she jumped off a cliff.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.312
There's no cliff out there.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.522
Somebody moved her?

12:11.523 --> 12:13.107
She wasn't moved.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.485
She died just where you found her.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.697
Doc, did you see this?

12:31.752 --> 12:33.628
What is it?

12:33.962 --> 12:35.922
Looks like glass.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.679
<i>"A Farewell to Arms."</i>

13:25.013 --> 13:26.806
"By Ernest Hemingway."

13:33.939 --> 13:36.941
You know the way this guy writes,

13:36.942 --> 13:40.403
he never talked to a
woman in his life.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.450
When did you ever read Hemingway?

13:46.284 --> 13:51.414
He thinks they all want
to be called "my darling."

13:53.250 --> 13:56.294
And what they really want is?

14:02.801 --> 14:06.929
What they really want is a man

14:07.681 --> 14:10.683
that'll listen to their stomachs.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.771
Max, don't drool on me.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.274
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

14:19.067 --> 14:20.943
I'm sorry.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.743
What's wrong?

14:30.787 --> 14:32.037
Tell me.

14:32.038 --> 14:35.625
We found a dead girl in the Valley.

14:38.169 --> 14:41.297
She was broken into 30 pieces.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.885
Couldn't even pick her up.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.851
Who is she?

14:54.227 --> 14:56.020
Nobody.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.734
Just a girl.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.779
Just a girl.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.741
I'm sorry, Kate.

15:16.499 --> 15:19.126
Can you believe that?
The D.A. won't indict Kroyle.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.669
What's wrong with this country?

15:20.670 --> 15:23.797
A guy chops up his parents with an
axe and doesn't get the gas chamber?

15:23.798 --> 15:26.091
How can you plea bargain
something like that?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.135
His fingerprints are all
over the murder weapon.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.803
That places him at the
scene of the crime.

15:29.804 --> 15:32.014
They won't indict.
It doesn't make any difference.

15:32.015 --> 15:35.100
I knew that D.A. when he
was a bagman for Jack Draga.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.645
No kiddin'. How'd he become
a D.A. then, for Christ' sake?

15:37.646 --> 15:39.021
D.A.'s an elected office.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.691
Any scumbag can get in
if they got enough votes.

15:44.319 --> 15:47.863
Ellery, how come you got a hot dog in your
mouth while you're threading a projector?

15:47.864 --> 15:51.534
Why do you eat while you're working?
Why do you eat all the time?

15:52.452 --> 15:56.998
It's all psychological, Max.
I eat so I don't think about food.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.000
So you eat so you
don't think about food?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.085
Yeah.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.212
Ellery, I don't want to
butt into your business,

16:03.213 --> 16:05.464
but this psychiatrist,
the guy you're going to,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.591
I think he's in worse
shape than you are.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.927
She, Max. It's a woman.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.390
Dammit, I can't get my finger
in there! It won't fit!

16:14.391 --> 16:16.183
Try your dick.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.559
Esther, please.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.437
Here, try this.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.065
So you're going to her about food?

16:23.066 --> 16:24.859
Yeah.

16:25.694 --> 16:29.155
I thought you were going to
her about the other thing.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.116
- My temper?
- Yeah.

16:32.117 --> 16:34.034
It's all related, Max.

16:34.035 --> 16:37.705
The eating and the anger,
they come from the same place.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.041
The food calms me down.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.510
Esther, don't you have
something better to do?

16:51.511 --> 16:54.347
No. Not better than this.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.473
All right.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.935
- Ready?
- Yeah. Turn it on.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.862
What is this, somebody's
summer vacation?

17:14.284 --> 17:17.036
That's the girl we found
in the Valley, Max.

18:05.543 --> 18:08.504
Max, I gotta talk to
you about this D.A.

18:08.505 --> 18:11.090
He's a prick. Max?

18:33.988 --> 18:37.032
Coolidge, do me a favor.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.159
You go get yourself something to eat.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.203
Go back to your desk.

18:41.663 --> 18:44.039
Max, if something is wrong...

18:44.040 --> 18:48.752
I mean, maybe it's best to talk it out,
you know, and get it out in the open,

18:48.753 --> 18:50.295
if it's anything like that.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.588
No, nothing like that.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.007
But any problem could be solved, Max.

18:54.008 --> 18:57.052
All you have to do is break
it down into parts, you see?

18:57.053 --> 19:00.222
It's just simple, it's right into parts,
my psychiatrist told me,

19:00.223 --> 19:02.307
and you deal with
each part individually.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.518
One part, and then you
go to the next part.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.520
You just gotta break
it down, but the first...

19:06.521 --> 19:08.356
Ellery.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.566
Do me that favor.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.235
Just do it.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.136
Hoover!

20:24.724 --> 20:26.225
You alone?

20:26.768 --> 20:28.394
Yeah.

20:36.444 --> 20:39.112
- I need protection.
- From what?

20:39.113 --> 20:40.739
You look at the film I sent you?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.783
You know who the guy in it is?

20:42.784 --> 20:45.160
I don't even know who you are.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.370
I'm Jimmy Fields.

20:46.371 --> 20:49.081
Look, that guy in the
movie, he killed her!

20:49.123 --> 20:50.499
Killed who?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.334
Spare me the crap,
I don't have time for it!

20:52.335 --> 20:54.586
A mutual friend is dead,
they killed her,

20:54.587 --> 20:57.923
and I'm going out the same way
unless I can get some help.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.800
How do you know she's dead?

21:02.220 --> 21:04.012
Because she would've
called me otherwise.

21:04.013 --> 21:07.391
Because she always called
me, always, always.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.935
Because I was her best friend.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.439
That means I didn't fuck her.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.401
What did you do with her,
share makeup tips?

21:18.695 --> 21:22.406
Do I make you nervous, Lieutenant?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.204
When was the last time you saw her?

21:28.997 --> 21:30.748
Saturday.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.833
In Vegas.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.294
She dropped my camera
off Saturday morning,

21:35.295 --> 21:37.212
said she'd meet me back in L.A.,

21:37.213 --> 21:40.048
that her and the general were
gonna go for a little ride.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.926
What general?

21:42.218 --> 21:44.094
Cops.

21:44.262 --> 21:46.054
Does Thomas Timms ring a bell?

21:46.055 --> 21:47.973
You go look it up.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.855
How many more films are there?

21:56.316 --> 21:58.234
Couple.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.484
Did she know?

21:59.485 --> 22:00.902
Maybe.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.821
I asked you a question.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.407
Did she know you were taking movies?

22:07.744 --> 22:09.495
No.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.623
I'd put that gun away.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.919
Help me, Hoover.
You're supposed to be a cop!

22:19.213 --> 22:21.882
I thought you couldn't
turn anybody down.

22:27.388 --> 22:29.473
Is that what she said?

22:31.559 --> 22:33.602
That's what she said.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.189
She was wrong.

22:47.825 --> 22:50.578
I had him by the neck
when he swore at me.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.371
Here he comes.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.540
Where are we going, Max?

22:56.501 --> 22:59.795
I got something to take care of.
I'll be back later.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.339
We gotta ask you a question.

23:03.049 --> 23:08.220
The dead girl, she's the same one
that's in the movie, isn't she?

23:09.305 --> 23:11.348
Coolidge tell you that?

23:11.724 --> 23:13.141
I've been worried, Max.

23:13.142 --> 23:16.978
Worried? You're worried?
What the hell you worried about?

23:16.979 --> 23:18.355
We're partners here.

23:18.356 --> 23:22.443
Tell us, was something going on
between you and that dead girl?

23:24.904 --> 23:28.615
Look, guys, I want you to cut
me a little slack on this one.

23:28.616 --> 23:31.160
Just let me do what I gotta do.

23:39.544 --> 23:42.254
I thought you had grand
jury testimony today.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.339
To hell with the grand jury, Max.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.342
So where are we going?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.935
You know, I've been thinking,

23:56.936 --> 23:59.980
why is it we always sit
in the same places?

24:00.064 --> 24:02.983
And why is it you're always
the one that drives, Max?

24:02.984 --> 24:05.110
I guess it's 'cause I got the keys.

24:05.111 --> 24:08.196
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
Why is it you always have the keys?

24:08.197 --> 24:10.574
There's reasons for
everything, right?

24:10.575 --> 24:14.619
Ellery, I would never
attempt to criticize

24:14.620 --> 24:18.040
the inner workings of the human mind.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.417
Are you still seeing
that psychiatrist?

24:20.418 --> 24:22.752
There's nothing wrong
with my psychiatrist.

24:22.753 --> 24:25.214
We just want to know how much longer.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.215
I don't know, it's open-ended.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.301
Oh, Jesus, God.

24:31.554 --> 24:34.014
Why is it you have the keys, Max?

24:35.099 --> 24:37.184
- Max.
- Yeah.

24:37.185 --> 24:39.061
Let Ellery drive.

24:44.901 --> 24:47.069
Are you happy, Coolidge?

24:47.403 --> 24:49.154
Yup.

24:50.072 --> 24:51.949
Take it out of low.

25:02.502 --> 25:03.919
Oh, jeez!

25:03.920 --> 25:05.462
Sorry, Max.

25:05.463 --> 25:08.424
That's why he usually has the keys.

25:13.596 --> 25:16.640
Relyea, go talk to the manager,
tell him we're going through a room.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.183
Right.

27:48.709 --> 27:52.212
Manager says some guy in 23,
a Jimmy Fields, is her best friend.

27:52.213 --> 27:55.090
Hasn't seen either one
of them in over a week.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.270
He's not very neat, is he?

28:15.361 --> 28:17.362
Son of a bitch!

28:25.955 --> 28:28.248
Son of a bitch!

29:08.164 --> 29:10.457
- You all right, Max?
- Yeah.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.212
For a minute there,

29:16.213 --> 29:18.340
I just couldn't breathe.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.593
I couldn't stay in there.

29:24.054 --> 29:26.640
- Want a cigarette?
- Yeah.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.274
How long were you seeing her?

29:43.908 --> 29:45.742
Six months.

29:46.911 --> 29:48.829
Every chance I got.

29:51.874 --> 29:53.709
Here?

29:55.127 --> 29:57.296
Yeah, here.

30:05.221 --> 30:07.013
Jesus Christ.

30:07.014 --> 30:10.183
That guy's got film on you
and everything, doesn't he?

30:19.276 --> 30:21.653
You remember Kenny Kamins?

30:22.238 --> 30:24.906
- Can I help you, gentlemen?
- We're looking for Kenny Kamins.

30:24.907 --> 30:27.075
- Have you seen him?
- Never heard of him.

30:27.076 --> 30:28.660
He never heard of him.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.704
You believe that, fellas?

30:33.415 --> 30:36.376
What are you guys doing here?
You got a fucking warrant?

30:36.377 --> 30:37.919
You sound like you're from New York.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.505
- So what?
- I'm from Jersey.

30:54.812 --> 30:57.188
What's going on? What do you
think you're doing, Kenny?

30:57.189 --> 31:00.108
Relax, Allison. Jenny and I
were just having a party.

31:00.109 --> 31:02.569
Go do something useful.
Go powder your nose.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.571
You're sick, Kenny. This is sick!

31:04.572 --> 31:06.781
I'm not gonna let you do
this to her. She's a child.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.241
So were you once, doll.

31:08.242 --> 31:10.410
Look at what a woman you became.

31:10.411 --> 31:12.162
No, Kenny.

31:12.246 --> 31:14.206
Are you nuts?

31:17.167 --> 31:19.628
Nice one. That was a good shot.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.298
Come here.

31:23.549 --> 31:26.551
You pull that shit again, and I'm
gonna break your little neck.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.387
All right?

31:28.721 --> 31:30.639
Hello, Kenny.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.309
This is a private party, Hoover.

31:34.310 --> 31:37.145
- You got a warrant?
- I got this.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.650
Remember this, Kenny?

31:42.776 --> 31:45.987
Kenny, Kenny, what are you doing?

31:54.997 --> 31:57.415
- Get her out of here.
- Let's go.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.584
You broke my fingers!

32:01.045 --> 32:03.504
What do you say, Kenny,
we have a little party?

32:03.505 --> 32:05.924
I don't do that stuff.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.384
- You don't want to see this.
- Yes, I do.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.678
Jesus Christ, Allison, call the cops!

32:10.679 --> 32:13.056
I am the cops, Kenny.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.913
Inventive way of dispensing justice.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.917
It's an integral part of the job.

32:41.877 --> 32:44.713
You were more effective than I was.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.002
So, who are you?

33:28.465 --> 33:30.884
You won't find out by killing me.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.774
Why did you fall for her, Max?

33:48.610 --> 33:50.611
What did Katherine say?

33:50.612 --> 33:52.697
You told her, didn't you?

33:58.954 --> 34:01.622
- The guy with the camera, he's a fruit?
- Right.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.792
Not shaking you down, is he?

34:04.043 --> 34:06.378
Could be, he's running scared.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.005
Maybe we should pay him a visit.

34:09.005 --> 34:12.092
I thought we weren't gonna
do that anymore. We agreed.

34:13.469 --> 34:16.929
Did you guys ever hear of a
general named Thomas Timms?

34:16.929 --> 34:18.222
Yeah.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.683
He's one of the inventors
of the A-bomb.

34:20.684 --> 34:23.853
They made him Chairman of
the Atomic Energy Commission.

34:24.146 --> 34:27.399
I got seven minutes of
film with him with Allison.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.824
You got trouble.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.370
Let's talk to the fruit.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.456
All right, let's go over it again.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.335
What did she say?

34:47.335 --> 34:51.214
She said that she was going
for a ride with Timms.

34:51.924 --> 34:54.384
Out to where they test those things.

34:55.385 --> 34:57.721
And she wasn't scared?

34:58.430 --> 35:02.225
No, she wasn't scared.
She was never scared.

35:02.810 --> 35:04.519
Except of being alone.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.938
Come on, Jimmy, sit down.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.822
What'd you make the films for, Jimmy?

35:16.198 --> 35:18.158
What'd you make the films for?

35:18.909 --> 35:20.868
Why were you in it?

35:20.869 --> 35:24.039
What was it? Blackmail?

35:25.082 --> 35:27.417
I thought about that.

35:28.001 --> 35:29.544
You know, for a rainy...

35:29.545 --> 35:31.045
Why'd you make 'em?

35:31.046 --> 35:33.214
- That was nice.
- What's wrong with Max?

35:33.215 --> 35:35.967
- I don't know.
- What's the matter with him?

35:36.051 --> 35:38.511
Why'd you make 'em, Jimmy?

35:39.096 --> 35:42.223
Because it made me feel a part of it.

35:45.352 --> 35:49.230
You know, watch the
boys get impassioned.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.734
You made films of me, didn't you?

35:53.819 --> 35:55.779
Yes, I did.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.074
Where are those films?

35:59.533 --> 36:01.910
That's the question, isn't it?

36:02.703 --> 36:04.829
When she didn't show up,
I went back to my apartment,

36:04.830 --> 36:06.414
but the place was torn apart.

36:06.415 --> 36:07.832
They'd taken them all.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.959
Except for the one I sent you.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.961
That was still at the lab.

36:15.215 --> 36:19.427
You know, Jimmy,
none of that proves Timms' guilt.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.429
What, do you need a roadmap?

36:21.513 --> 36:24.390
Timms knew about the film.
He's the last to see her alive.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.976
She's dead. They killed her up there.

36:26.977 --> 36:29.353
She didn't die in the
desert, she died here.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.439
Right outside of L.A.

36:32.149 --> 36:35.985
You told me yourself that Allison
didn't know about the films,

36:35.986 --> 36:38.571
so Timms couldn't have
known about it either.

36:39.156 --> 36:41.115
Why would a guy kill his girl

36:41.116 --> 36:44.577
over a film he didn't
even know existed?

36:45.162 --> 36:47.539
You were the last to see her alive.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.458
How do I know you didn't kill her?

36:53.545 --> 36:57.966
Because I loved her and
she was my best friend.

36:59.843 --> 37:03.054
She nearly died when you left,
did you know that?

37:03.055 --> 37:05.681
She loved you, and you just used her.

37:05.682 --> 37:07.475
How does that feel?

37:07.476 --> 37:11.479
You know, you sit there like
you're protecting the innocent.

37:11.480 --> 37:14.649
All you really do is
just beat up on the weak

37:14.733 --> 37:17.610
and disregard or destroy anybody
or anything that stands in the way

37:17.611 --> 37:22.407
of you and your pathetic little sense
of right or wrong or justice and power.

37:22.574 --> 37:27.454
If anybody is responsible
for Allison's death

37:28.789 --> 37:29.830
it's you.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.832
You son of a bitch!

37:31.833 --> 37:33.501
Shit! Come on, Eddie.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.712
Come on, he's gonna kill me!

37:38.548 --> 37:40.383
Come on!

37:41.802 --> 37:43.844
- Get him out of here!
- It ain't worth it.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.514
You don't realize.
Just get him out of here!

37:47.766 --> 37:50.518
Come on, Fields, let's go. Move it.

37:59.027 --> 38:02.101
Max, everybody has weak moments.
You gotta get it out,

38:02.102 --> 38:05.992
- you gotta tell Kathy.
- Shut up! Shut the hell up!

38:05.993 --> 38:09.036
Jesus Christ, is that what
your psychiatrist told you?

38:09.037 --> 38:11.539
Let me tell you how it goes, Ellery.

38:11.873 --> 38:15.293
You meet somebody.
Maybe they're a little off center,

38:15.294 --> 38:18.671
but they tell you the truth.
And you like them for that,

38:18.672 --> 38:20.923
and one thing leads to another,
and you end up in bed.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.717
- Now, that's weak.
- Max...

38:22.718 --> 38:25.595
But, now, listen to me.
Nobody gets hurt.

38:25.971 --> 38:31.350
You go home, and you see your
wife, and you're feeling bad.

38:31.351 --> 38:34.437
You want to unload it,
you want to get it off your chest.

38:34.438 --> 38:38.274
So you tell her, and now she's hurt.

38:38.400 --> 38:43.029
Now, that's weak, too, Ellery.
But it's also cruel.

38:43.030 --> 38:45.740
It's just goddamn cruel.

38:47.034 --> 38:49.452
Here's something for you.

38:49.661 --> 38:53.414
Here's something that doesn't
cost you 25 bucks an hour.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.251
You carry your own water, Ellery.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.129
You understand?

39:00.255 --> 39:02.590
Carry your own water.

39:09.389 --> 39:11.974
Max, I was just
trying to help. I'm sorry.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.809
No, forget it.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.603
It's all right.

39:28.992 --> 39:30.993
We're still partners, right?

39:30.994 --> 39:33.120
Yeah. Partners.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.039
Thanks, Ell.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.125
Go help them, will you?

39:41.630 --> 39:43.965
- You okay, Max?
- Yeah.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.723
Come here.

40:56.037 --> 40:59.332
I don't understand how
anybody can live at the beach.

40:59.374 --> 41:03.169
Those waves crashing
and flopping all the time

41:03.712 --> 41:05.797
drive me crazy.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.049
I'm with you, Eddie. I like the
sound of traffic when I'm sleeping.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.386
I find it very peaceful.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.763
Most people do.

41:14.222 --> 41:16.516
I guess cops are just different.

41:17.601 --> 41:19.727
Don't push your luck there, Fields.

41:19.728 --> 41:22.396
The only reason we're
here is because of Max.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.315
If I had it my way,

41:24.316 --> 41:27.026
I'd rather dump you
out of a speeding car.

41:27.027 --> 41:29.570
See if you'd bounce around a little.

41:30.405 --> 41:31.697
Hey, Earl!

41:31.698 --> 41:33.574
How's that chili comin'?

41:33.575 --> 41:35.034
It's done.

41:35.035 --> 41:38.830
As my Aunt Mabel used to say,
presentation is everything.

41:39.039 --> 41:41.415
I think you and Coolidge
ought to open up an automat.

41:41.416 --> 41:44.252
The look is connected
to the way it tastes.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.135
Stay down!

42:04.523 --> 42:06.232
It stopped.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.486
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.039
Where's Fields?

42:21.665 --> 42:24.250
- I'll get him back.
- Right.

42:29.172 --> 42:30.965
Fields!

42:34.553 --> 42:36.429
Shit!

42:57.450 --> 42:59.327
That's it.

43:02.664 --> 43:05.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess so.

43:16.845 --> 43:18.679
You see 'em take Fields?

43:18.680 --> 43:21.099
I couldn't see shit, Max.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.185
They shot the hell out of this place.

43:24.352 --> 43:27.855
Must've had a heavy machine gun.

43:28.023 --> 43:30.525
Fruitcake disappeared.

43:34.070 --> 43:37.865
Lieutenant? They want
you down at the beach.

44:11.066 --> 44:13.693
We see around the head there...

44:13.902 --> 44:16.362
- Jesus Christ.
- How'd they kill him, doc?

44:16.363 --> 44:18.238
What can I tell you?
They stuck a gun in his mouth

44:18.239 --> 44:20.407
- and blew the back of his head off.
- An execution?

44:20.408 --> 44:22.242
Not until they asked him
some questions first.

44:22.243 --> 44:24.370
Contusions, abrasions,
ecchymosis around the neck.

44:24.371 --> 44:25.704
Right.

44:25.705 --> 44:28.248
Come on, I want to show
you guys something.

44:28.249 --> 44:32.628
We took these x-rays of Allison Pond.
Look what happened.

44:34.756 --> 44:37.425
Yeah, this foot's got a heel.

44:37.926 --> 44:40.094
This one doesn't.
Why is it all blurry?

44:40.095 --> 44:42.513
Gamma rays fog the film.

44:42.514 --> 44:45.975
That glass in her foot,
it's radioactive.

45:21.803 --> 45:23.638
Yes, sir?

45:24.055 --> 45:26.557
LAPD. I'm here to see General Timms.

45:29.310 --> 45:31.270
Hey, give me that.

45:36.401 --> 45:38.026
Five to one we don't get in.

45:38.027 --> 45:40.404
This is the Army.
I say we try the back way.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.114
Five to one... I take those odds.

45:42.115 --> 45:43.615
- You'll take it?
- Yeah.

45:43.616 --> 45:44.658
Five to one?

45:44.659 --> 45:48.246
- Here's my five.
- Here, you hold the money.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.374
Make sure he knows that.

45:53.960 --> 45:57.213
Sorry, sir. No civilian
admittance, no exceptions.

45:58.339 --> 45:59.757
Did you talk to General Timms?

45:59.758 --> 46:01.842
The General's unavailable, sir.

46:01.843 --> 46:03.510
Did you tell him it
was police business?

46:03.511 --> 46:06.681
Yes, sir. They said no civilian
admittance, no exceptions.

46:10.769 --> 46:13.020
You lose, Coolidge.

46:13.062 --> 46:15.856
You know, you could've talked
to him a little more, Max.

46:15.857 --> 46:17.984
You owe me a buck.

47:01.110 --> 47:02.820
Wait, wait, wait.

47:02.821 --> 47:04.863
Amateur hour.

47:04.864 --> 47:07.325
Seen too many movies, Relyea.

47:26.886 --> 47:27.970
Shit.

47:27.971 --> 47:30.973
- Come on, it's hot.
- I'll get it, I'll get it.

47:33.309 --> 47:35.102
Let me try.

47:35.270 --> 47:37.063
All right.

47:47.115 --> 47:51.369
You know, when I was a kid, I thought
everybody in Hollywood had a horse.

47:51.953 --> 47:55.122
Because every movie I
saw was a cowboy movie.

47:55.123 --> 47:57.624
You remember those movies, right?

47:57.625 --> 47:59.543
They would come galloping into town,

47:59.544 --> 48:03.338
the cowboys would get off the
horse, dust all over the place.

48:03.339 --> 48:05.340
They get the reins and
wrap it around the railing

48:05.341 --> 48:07.593
once, twice, three times,
keep on wrapping it,

48:07.594 --> 48:09.887
but Gene Autry?
Let me tell you something.

48:09.888 --> 48:12.973
Gene Autry would come into
town, jump off the horse,

48:12.974 --> 48:16.977
and carefully wrap the reins
around once, just once.

48:17.145 --> 48:19.897
Then he would go inside
and see the sheriff.

48:22.233 --> 48:25.069
Boy, did I worry about
that horse getting away.

48:26.154 --> 48:27.947
I did.

48:45.673 --> 48:47.550
What the hell is that?

48:51.054 --> 48:53.139
This place is weird.

49:43.272 --> 49:45.900
Jesus, what a big hole.

49:47.652 --> 49:50.487
We just dropped the
damn thing right here?

49:50.488 --> 49:54.325
Yup. That's what happens when
they set one off at ground level.

49:55.451 --> 49:57.578
What happened to all the dirt?

49:58.037 --> 50:00.831
Vaporized, along with
everything else.

50:02.417 --> 50:04.376
We got company.

50:07.714 --> 50:10.424
- Guess it's time to go, huh?
- Yeah.

50:25.815 --> 50:27.650
Step on it.

50:38.453 --> 50:40.955
Put your hands in the
air or you will be shot!

51:09.817 --> 51:11.527
They're clean, sir.

51:31.005 --> 51:33.882
You men are in violation
of federal law.

51:34.801 --> 51:37.011
I could have you all shot.

51:37.345 --> 51:39.555
Do you have some identification?

51:41.724 --> 51:43.183
There you go.

51:48.773 --> 51:51.358
Put your hands down, gentlemen.

51:52.819 --> 51:54.778
"Lieutenant Hoover."

51:55.154 --> 51:57.406
Los Angeles Police Department.

51:57.698 --> 52:00.618
We're investigating a homicide, sir.

52:00.701 --> 52:03.037
You're way out of your
jurisdiction, Lieutenant.

52:04.747 --> 52:07.582
I'm going to assume that you
are aware of the penalties

52:07.583 --> 52:10.210
for trespassing a federally
restricted area.

52:10.837 --> 52:13.547
And for destruction of
government property.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.173
We go where the case takes us.

52:15.174 --> 52:17.551
Not if it takes you here you don't.

52:18.094 --> 52:20.220
Out here it's military law.

52:20.721 --> 52:22.848
And I'm in charge of enforcing it.

52:24.642 --> 52:26.309
Captain?

52:26.310 --> 52:28.895
Escort these gentlemen back
to the base and lock them up.

52:28.896 --> 52:31.315
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel, sir?

52:35.570 --> 52:37.321
Yes, sir.

52:37.905 --> 52:41.033
On the perimeter, sir,
but they'd violated security...

52:42.243 --> 52:44.286
I don't think that's
a good idea, sir.

52:44.287 --> 52:47.498
Well, I don't think
that's a good idea, sir.

52:48.916 --> 52:50.584
Yes, sir.

52:51.836 --> 52:53.504
Yes, sir.

52:57.592 --> 52:59.050
Put that one in the jeep.

52:59.051 --> 53:00.635
The rest of them can
wait at the base.

53:00.636 --> 53:02.596
- Sergeant!
- Miller, Resnick!

53:02.597 --> 53:04.306
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

53:04.307 --> 53:07.184
If I see this vehicle in
a restricted area again,

53:07.185 --> 53:10.437
I'll burn it... And everyone in it.

53:36.547 --> 53:38.298
Lieutenant.

53:48.517 --> 53:50.394
Wait here.

54:13.125 --> 54:16.169
Hoover, Truman...

54:16.170 --> 54:18.046
Is that the general?

54:20.841 --> 54:22.843
All bombs.

54:24.971 --> 54:27.347
- What are those?
- Ships.

54:28.474 --> 54:30.517
Lieutenant Hoover, I'm General Timms.

54:30.518 --> 54:34.104
What can I do for the Los Angeles
Police Department today?

54:34.647 --> 54:36.940
I came to talk about Allison Pond.

54:36.941 --> 54:40.527
Yes, I know.
Colonel Fitzgerald informed me.

54:40.528 --> 54:44.031
Did he also mention the condition
in which Miss Pond was found?

54:44.532 --> 54:46.366
Yes, he did.

54:46.867 --> 54:52.706
Excuse me for not wanting to stand,
but I've had a horse accident.

54:52.707 --> 54:55.208
I pinched a sciatic nerve.

54:55.209 --> 54:57.460
Have you ever had
back troubles, Lieutenant?

54:57.461 --> 54:59.713
I got shot there once.

55:11.767 --> 55:14.227
I'm going to cut through
formalities, Lieutenant.

55:14.228 --> 55:18.648
You are aware that Miss Pond
and I had a certain relationship,

55:18.649 --> 55:24.071
and I believe you're also aware that she
had similar relationships with other men.

55:25.573 --> 55:27.657
I believe Miss Pond
was in your company

55:27.658 --> 55:29.659
from Friday through the weekend.

55:29.660 --> 55:34.039
That sounds about right.
We went to Tahoe on Saturday.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.582
Senator Bolton has a house there

55:35.583 --> 55:38.752
that he lends us for the
weekend from time to time.

55:39.128 --> 55:41.755
So you were in Tahoe, not here?

55:41.756 --> 55:44.215
Friday night here,
then Tahoe on Saturday,

55:44.216 --> 55:47.094
and Sunday night,
I flew to Washington.

55:48.262 --> 55:50.180
She wasn't out at the test site?

55:50.181 --> 55:52.266
That's restricted.

55:52.850 --> 55:55.435
But then you know that, don't you?

55:57.063 --> 56:00.273
She went down to Los Angeles
Saturday, Lieutenant,

56:00.274 --> 56:05.112
and I went on for a meeting
with the Secretary of Defense.

56:07.990 --> 56:10.950
Do you think much about
national security, Lieutenant?

56:10.951 --> 56:15.205
Well, I got all the security I can
handle right now in L.A., General.

56:16.624 --> 56:19.918
Do you know much about
atomic energy, what it means?

56:19.919 --> 56:22.004
Ended the war.

56:23.464 --> 56:26.633
Did you know that the atom
itself is mostly empty space?

56:26.634 --> 56:29.010
I never really thought
about it, General.

56:29.011 --> 56:32.889
Almost completely empty,
but with tiny fragments of matter.

56:32.890 --> 56:35.767
And since this entire universe
is made up of atoms,

56:35.768 --> 56:40.313
everything that we see and touch...
In fact, the very floor beneath us

56:40.314 --> 56:42.816
is made up of almost
completely empty space.

56:42.817 --> 56:44.984
The only reason we
don't fall through it

56:44.985 --> 56:49.239
is because these tiny particles
of matter are just whirling about

56:49.240 --> 56:53.243
at such speed that they give
us the illusion of solidity.

56:53.244 --> 56:57.664
Actually, the floor is spinning
right underneath our feet.

56:57.665 --> 56:59.666
Do you feel it, Lieutenant?

57:01.085 --> 57:03.878
Then we're just empty
space ourselves.

57:03.879 --> 57:05.213
Exactly, exactly.

57:05.214 --> 57:08.633
And these tiny particles of matter,

57:08.634 --> 57:13.012
which are so small that no
one's ever seen them, never,

57:13.013 --> 57:17.684
they contain enough energy
to blow up this house,

57:17.685 --> 57:22.063
an entire city,
every person on Earth.

57:22.064 --> 57:24.983
That is inconceivable.

57:25.234 --> 57:28.403
General, I really don't think
much about those things.

57:28.404 --> 57:30.906
I'd probably see too much.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.158
What do you see?

57:36.036 --> 57:38.538
People dead before their time.

57:39.081 --> 57:41.959
That's the history of
the world, Lieutenant.

57:42.209 --> 57:44.836
Some people die before their
time so that others can live.

57:44.837 --> 57:47.046
It's the cornerstone of civilization.

57:47.047 --> 57:49.591
War, religion, democracy.

57:49.592 --> 57:52.385
A hundred die so that
a thousand may live.

57:52.386 --> 57:55.263
Well, General, I take
'em one at a time.

57:55.264 --> 57:57.933
Right now I got Allison Pond.

58:05.524 --> 58:09.319
We're not so different,
you and I, Lieutenant.

58:10.571 --> 58:13.198
You see, certain men...

58:13.491 --> 58:16.534
A doctor, a national leader,
an officer of the law,

58:16.535 --> 58:20.121
give to society in ways
that most people do not.

58:20.122 --> 58:23.082
In turn, society gives them
certain considerations.

58:23.083 --> 58:25.543
Now, we don't teach this in school.

58:25.544 --> 58:27.587
We don't acknowledge it.

58:27.588 --> 58:30.590
But those who accept
the burden of leadership

58:30.591 --> 58:33.468
understand they have
these considerations.

58:33.469 --> 58:36.847
You've accepted the burden of
leadership, haven't you, Lieutenant?

58:36.931 --> 58:39.099
In what sense, General?

58:39.767 --> 58:42.894
You protect society,
the ordinary citizen.

58:43.020 --> 58:47.106
Now, in doing so,
sometimes you may break the law.

58:47.107 --> 58:52.153
You may violate the Constitution,
the Bill of Rights, Search and Seizure.

58:52.154 --> 58:55.573
In fact, it may even be
known that you do so.

58:55.574 --> 58:57.283
And yet, nothing happens,

58:57.284 --> 59:01.538
because it is understood that that
is part of the burden of leadership.

59:01.539 --> 59:03.456
And you accept it.

59:03.457 --> 59:05.917
You accept your sins.

59:08.462 --> 59:13.008
General, Allison Pond
was out at your test site.

59:13.968 --> 59:18.638
We found this in her foot.

59:21.183 --> 59:23.643
I'm gonna need your calendar
for the last month,

59:23.644 --> 59:25.812
where you were, who you saw.

59:25.938 --> 59:27.731
Of course you are.

59:27.856 --> 59:31.318
Colonel Fitzgerald will get
you everything you need.

59:31.610 --> 59:33.320
Thank you, sir.

59:34.655 --> 59:36.406
Nice house.

59:46.375 --> 59:48.627
I've spoken to Los Angeles.

59:48.669 --> 59:51.421
We'll have the film within 24 hours.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.346
What'd Timms have to say?

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:05.393
He said the cornerstone of
civilization was human sacrifice.

01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.663
Lieutenant Hoover, sir.

01:00:25.664 --> 01:00:27.498
Maxwell.

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:32.795
Maxwell Hoover, say hello to
Special Agent Jeffrey McCafferty

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.257
of the old FBI.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.926
Lieutenant.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:42.305
Special Agent McCafferty here seems
to be interested in one of our cases.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.976
Allison Pond.

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:49.812
Special Agent, that was her
name, wasn't it? Allison Pond?

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.439
Yes, sir.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.819
Bill, you mind if I inquire what
business it is of the FBI's?

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.780
If I may, Chief.

01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:01.908
Our role here is
purely informational.

01:01:01.909 --> 01:01:03.159
We are aware of the fact

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.953
that a man of fundamental
importance to national security

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:08.623
has somehow been brought
into an investigation

01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:11.293
in reference to a young girl's death.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:16.547
In light of the damage that this could do
to him both personally and in his work,

01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:19.384
the director felt that
it was appropriate,

01:01:19.385 --> 01:01:22.970
without stepping on your
jurisdiction, of course,

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:26.349
for me to come down and share with
you our knowledge of the situation.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.435
And what would that be?

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:33.606
I'm prepared to give you the
director's personal guarantee

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:37.777
that General Timms had nothing to
do with the death of Allison Pond.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.283
How would the director
know something like that?

01:01:44.243 --> 01:01:47.204
I'm afraid I'm not at
liberty to discuss that.

01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:51.124
That's it?

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.292
That's it?

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:55.169
If I call your boss in Washington,

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.798
he'll vouch for this pile
of crap you're handing us?

01:01:58.799 --> 01:02:00.967
The director specifically
asked me to tell you

01:02:00.968 --> 01:02:04.971
that he appreciates your cooperation
in this matter, Lieutenant Hoover.

01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:09.976
He also felt that you would understand
the sensitive nature of the situation,

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:13.146
being that you're a
married man yourself.

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:20.153
We are not within our
resources, gentlemen.

01:02:20.154 --> 01:02:23.156
And we're more than willing
to share them with you.

01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:26.743
Of course, if you were to come across
anything in regard to evidence,

01:02:26.744 --> 01:02:29.704
the director would be
grateful to see it himself.

01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:38.380
The director would be very grateful.

01:02:45.012 --> 01:02:46.846
Maxwell...

01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:53.436
Do you have the slightest
idea how intensely I hate

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:57.482
these pathetic little Ivy
League cops being in my town?

01:02:57.775 --> 01:03:01.903
Let alone sitting in
a chair in my office?

01:03:01.904 --> 01:03:05.031
Yes, sir, I sure do. Yes, sir.

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:09.577
Have you got anything
hard on this guy Timms?

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:12.247
He's lying about Allison Pond.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.709
- Can you prove that?
- No, sir, I can't prove it, but I will.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:19.545
But here's the deal, Bill.
We had an informant.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:22.548
Now, he was killed at the
beach by a heavy machine gun

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.217
heavy caliber machine gun.

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:26.135
That's military, that's a connection.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:29.764
Wait a second, I know three guys
a block from Lankershim Boulevard

01:03:29.765 --> 01:03:34.811
in North Hollywood alone who've got
the same ordnance in their back rooms.

01:03:36.188 --> 01:03:37.355
Wake up.

01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:41.943
Bill, when we set this squad up,
we answered to nobody but you.

01:03:41.944 --> 01:03:43.820
That was the deal, nobody but you.

01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:46.989
Four men, no politics, no favors.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.659
- We answered to nobody.
- No.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:53.621
When we set it up, it was
organized to do two things,

01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:56.332
get rid of gangsters and criminals,

01:03:56.333 --> 01:04:00.002
not go up against the
Atomic Energy Commission.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:03.340
But goddamn it, Bill,
what if they're killing people?

01:04:04.258 --> 01:04:07.302
Sometimes you guys talk to people

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:11.264
and nobody ever sees 'em again.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:13.349
They become history.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.977
Nobody looks too hard into that.

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:25.320
Allison Pond never hurt anybody.

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:28.281
She must've done something.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:33.870
Otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting
here talking about her like this.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.209
I'm coming.

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:43.796
- Mrs. Hoover?
- Yes?

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:46.925
FBI. We have a warrant to
search the premises, ma'am.

01:04:47.134 --> 01:04:49.010
A warrant?

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:53.806
You're looking for a film?

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:54.932
What kind of film?

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:56.642
Mike, check the bookcase, please.

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:58.853
What kind of film?

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.374
Esther, where's Max?

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:21.334
Cut it.

01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:22.961
No!

01:05:23.337 --> 01:05:25.296
Find him!

01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:52.490
- Are you hurt?
- No.

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.371
What happened?

01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:03.585
The FBI was here with a search
warrant, looking for a film.

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:27.400
What's going on?

01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:33.281
Max, what is going on?

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:41.080
The man in the film is
named Thomas Timms.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.210
He's the head of the
Atomic Energy Commission.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:48.796
And the girl is dead.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.965
- That's all?
- That's all.

01:06:56.138 --> 01:06:58.764
You know why these
guys are still L.A. cops?

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:01.434
Because they couldn't cut the
grade to make federal agents.

01:07:01.435 --> 01:07:04.020
Wire taps, warrants, subpoenas.

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:06.480
You follow proper procedure,
and it can't fail, boys.

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:08.274
J. Edgar taught me that.

01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:10.860
This prick from the LAPD
thinks he got over on me?

01:07:10.861 --> 01:07:14.364
I fixed his ass with a search
warrant on his premises.

01:07:14.823 --> 01:07:16.782
What if Hoover comes here?

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:19.452
I'll arrest him for trespassing.

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:22.288
Jesus Christ!

01:08:07.793 --> 01:08:10.836
See? That's federal property.

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:12.880
This isn't.

01:08:12.881 --> 01:08:14.256
This is L.A.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.091
This is my town.

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:18.426
Out here you're a trespasser.

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:21.721
Out here I could pick
you up, burn your house,

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.765
fuck your wife, and kill your dog.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:28.270
And the only thing that'll protect
you is if I can't find you

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:31.399
and I already found you.

01:10:42.656 --> 01:10:44.490
How long?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.877
Six months.

01:10:58.672 --> 01:11:00.715
A little less.

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:16.063
Did everybody know?

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:19.525
No.

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:21.652
No, nobody knew.

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:42.340
It's been over...

01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:48.179
You Pig!

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.636
<i>Hoover.</i>

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:34.809
Fitzgerald.

01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:37.436
<i>You've got something of ours.</i>

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:44.068
I want to see Timms.

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:46.820
<i>There's no reason to involve
the General in this.</i>

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:49.991
<i>It's a straight trade,
yours for ours.</i>

01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:52.785
<i>What you got today was a copy.</i>

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:55.538
<i>We will do whatever is necessary.</i>

01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:59.709
No Timms, no deal.

01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:05.464
<i>All right. 10:00 tomorrow at the
military airfield west of the city.</i>

01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:08.801
<i>You bring everything,
we bring everything.</i>

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:11.554
<i>Originals and any copies.</i>

01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:54.490
This is where you bring
people to get rid of them.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.036
Isn't it?

01:15:09.464 --> 01:15:11.632
It's over, right?

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:18.138
It's not like that, Allison.

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:20.433
It's not just over.

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:27.857
The thing is you think you
can have it both ways,

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:31.110
that you can make it work both ways.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:34.071
But I can't.

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:40.202
I have different problems, Max.

01:15:44.916 --> 01:15:47.793
I never wanted it both ways.

01:17:04.078 --> 01:17:06.705
I thought you were asleep.

01:17:19.177 --> 01:17:21.303
What are you thinking about?

01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:39.655
I know what you think.

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:44.410
I just don't know how
you're thinking about it.

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:52.376
It isn't good.

01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:57.381
Yeah.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.604
You want me to leave for a while?

01:18:17.068 --> 01:18:18.861
At least.

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:12.456
- We got a serious problem, Max.
- What's that?

01:19:12.457 --> 01:19:14.750
Hoover. Not you, the other Hoover.

01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:17.252
Called the chief from
Washington 5:00 this morning.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:19.588
The chief has been looking
for you ever since.

01:19:19.589 --> 01:19:22.883
Kidnapping, assault,
attempted murder.

01:19:22.884 --> 01:19:26.011
If I attempted to murder
McCafferty, he'd be dead.

01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:28.597
Max, this is serious.
The chief is pissed!

01:19:28.598 --> 01:19:30.807
So let him be pissed.

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:34.728
Max, he wants to talk to you.

01:19:35.855 --> 01:19:37.856
- What the hell are you doing?
- Coming along.

01:19:37.857 --> 01:19:40.525
I am not going back there telling
the chief you wouldn't come.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:43.195
Hall's right about that psychiatrist.

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:45.197
He's turning you into
a piano teacher.

01:19:45.198 --> 01:19:47.616
She. It's a woman, Max.

01:19:47.617 --> 01:19:49.993
Where are we going, Max?

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:52.997
Max? Where are we going?

01:20:19.607 --> 01:20:22.443
This is about to turn
bad, isn't it, Max?

01:20:23.027 --> 01:20:25.904
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:31.159
Now, listen, Coolidge,
you don't come with me.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.661
This is personal.

01:20:32.662 --> 01:20:34.371
Max, I'm coming.

01:20:34.372 --> 01:20:36.331
No, no, listen to me.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.250
This is something I gotta do.

01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:41.253
Max, we're partners. I'm coming.

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:48.093
Right. Right, we're partners.

01:21:31.429 --> 01:21:34.639
Lieutenant, we only
expected one visitor.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.808
He goes wherever I go.

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:38.811
We're partners.

01:21:38.853 --> 01:21:40.061
Suit yourself.

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:42.356
Sergeant, search 'em for weapons.

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:45.401
- I don't carry a gun.
- Raise your arms, sir.

01:21:55.995 --> 01:21:57.704
That's very impressive.

01:21:58.164 --> 01:22:00.833
Escort them to Colonel
Fitzgerald's office.

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:32.281
What's that?

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:34.867
It's a restricted area, sir.

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.661
- Restricted?
- Yes, sir.

01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:41.581
- Can I see it?
- Sir, that area is restricted.

01:22:41.582 --> 01:22:44.042
I cannot take you there.

01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:54.219
You know, Coolidge...

01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:58.056
Take this.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.687
Stash the car. I'll meet you later.

01:23:03.688 --> 01:23:05.772
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

01:25:03.182 --> 01:25:05.058
It's locked?

01:25:05.768 --> 01:25:07.477
Locked.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:16.612
Wait here, I'll go around back.

01:26:00.573 --> 01:26:02.658
Lieutenant Hoover?

01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:17.381
What is it?

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:22.844
Cancer.

01:26:24.305 --> 01:26:27.349
It's in my blood, my bones.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.103
Even now, they tell me, in my brain.

01:26:32.897 --> 01:26:36.608
You've never seen anyone
with terminal cancer, have you?

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:41.113
I saw a whole roomful of
terminal cancer on my way in.

01:26:43.282 --> 01:26:46.910
The hundred who died so
that the thousand might live.

01:26:49.997 --> 01:26:52.666
What were they, experiments?

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:56.920
Think of them as soldiers.

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:05.637
They didn't seem like soldiers to me.

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:09.641
That's why you killed Allison.

01:27:09.642 --> 01:27:11.226
My God, Lieutenant.

01:27:11.227 --> 01:27:13.645
Why would I kill Allison?

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:18.150
She showed me pleasures
I never dreamed existed.

01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:22.904
It's all I think about these days.

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:28.785
I'm sure you understand that.

01:27:35.793 --> 01:27:37.919
It was a mistake.

01:27:38.671 --> 01:27:41.590
What do you mean, it was a mistake?

01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:43.759
Her death.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.053
An error in judgment.

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:50.724
An overzealous reaction

01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:54.936
against a perceived threat
to national security.

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:01.777
She saw the cancer ward.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:04.780
She took pictures.

01:28:05.656 --> 01:28:09.451
You're much more intelligent than
you appear to be, Lieutenant.

01:28:09.994 --> 01:28:13.121
Must be a big advantage
in your field.

01:28:13.372 --> 01:28:15.206
In my field, everyone
was always so desperate

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:18.043
to seem cleverer than they were.

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:36.311
- What is that?
- Film.

01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:39.022
Of you and Allison.

01:28:44.153 --> 01:28:47.447
She was spectacular, wasn't she?

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.662
Drop the gun, Lieutenant.

01:28:59.418 --> 01:29:01.169
What now, Colonel?

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.963
Sir, they breached security,
they intended to harm you.

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:06.591
No, they brought me a film.

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:08.843
Pardon me, sir,
but they've compromised

01:29:08.844 --> 01:29:10.929
top secret scientific areas.

01:29:11.096 --> 01:29:12.764
We have a test scheduled in one hour.

01:29:12.765 --> 01:29:16.601
I understand that perfectly, Colonel.
These men are not enemies.

01:29:16.769 --> 01:29:19.979
Perhaps you could see to it that
they are taken back to Los Angeles.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:23.191
With all due respect, General, security
for this particular installation...

01:29:23.192 --> 01:29:25.026
Colonel...

01:29:26.612 --> 01:29:29.155
Take them back now.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.368
All right.

01:29:33.786 --> 01:29:35.412
Sir.

01:29:58.602 --> 01:30:00.520
The captain and I have
business in Los Angeles.

01:30:00.521 --> 01:30:02.438
We're gonna catch a ride down
with you if you don't mind.

01:30:02.439 --> 01:30:04.524
It's your plane.

01:30:11.824 --> 01:30:14.284
- Let's take it up.
- Roger.

01:30:34.138 --> 01:30:36.347
How come there's no door?
It's very loud.

01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:40.185
This plane is rigged for jumping.
You won't be uncomfortable.

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:13.718
They're gonna throw
us out of the plane,

01:31:13.719 --> 01:31:16.221
just like they did Allison Pond.

01:31:18.098 --> 01:31:20.725
You gave us the
wrong film, Lieutenant.

01:31:21.935 --> 01:31:25.438
I'm not interested in police
training films about the clap.

01:31:26.356 --> 01:31:28.232
Everything you have for
everything we have

01:31:28.233 --> 01:31:30.109
that was the understanding.

01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:32.904
But you see, there's a problem.

01:31:33.071 --> 01:31:36.825
- You sent the film to my house.
- That was to get your attention.

01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:40.244
No copies were sent to the press or
the Los Angeles Police Department.

01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:45.917
You see, the problem is you sent the
film to my house addressed to my wife.

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:49.921
And she watched it.

01:31:49.963 --> 01:31:52.590
I don't care who sees it now.

01:31:53.592 --> 01:31:55.719
See what I mean?

01:31:58.472 --> 01:32:01.224
I don't have anything to lose.

01:32:07.356 --> 01:32:09.524
Does Timms know about this?

01:32:09.525 --> 01:32:11.317
The general's no longer relevant.

01:32:11.318 --> 01:32:13.653
Who made the decision to
throw her out of the plane?

01:32:13.654 --> 01:32:16.781
If such a thing had happened,
the general wouldn't have been informed.

01:32:16.782 --> 01:32:18.908
He wouldn't have made that decision.

01:32:18.909 --> 01:32:20.910
Of course not.

01:32:21.245 --> 01:32:23.121
Would it have been you?

01:32:23.539 --> 01:32:25.290
That's right.

01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:28.584
If he couldn't intervene on her part,

01:32:28.585 --> 01:32:31.129
he can't intervene to save you.

01:32:33.632 --> 01:32:36.301
No one can intervene
here, Lieutenant.

01:32:42.224 --> 01:32:45.268
They threw Allison out of the plane.

01:32:45.644 --> 01:32:48.897
- They threw her out of the plane, Max.
- That's right.

01:32:49.898 --> 01:32:52.484
You threw that little
girl out of a plane!

01:33:43.744 --> 01:33:46.204
You're pathetic, Hoover!

01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:48.998
I did my job!

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:52.501
She died because she was in the way!

01:33:52.502 --> 01:33:56.214
She died for nothing,
you son of a bitch!

01:33:58.967 --> 01:34:00.927
Hold on, Max.

01:34:04.723 --> 01:34:06.140
What the hell's going on in here?

01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:08.225
- What's happening?
- Oh, my God.

01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:09.560
Is he all right?

01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:11.563
He's been shot, Max.

01:34:15.275 --> 01:34:16.776
Is he dead?

01:34:16.777 --> 01:34:18.736
Come on, get up! Come on!

01:34:18.737 --> 01:34:20.446
Get up! Wake up. He's alive!

01:34:20.447 --> 01:34:23.825
You fly this plane, or I'll fucking
kill you right here, you hear me?

01:34:26.578 --> 01:34:30.206
Stay awake. We gotta land this
plane now, or he's gonna die on us.

01:34:30.207 --> 01:34:31.874
Come on. We need you
to fly the plane.

01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:34.168
- You gotta fly this plane.
- We need you to fly the plane!

01:34:34.169 --> 01:34:36.170
Stay awake. Come on, come on.

01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:38.006
That's it.

01:34:54.523 --> 01:34:56.274
Oh, Jesus!

01:35:26.805 --> 01:35:28.890
We made it, Max!

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.396
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:35:35.397 --> 01:35:38.274
Yeah, I'm okay. You all right?

01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:42.987
I feel cold, Max.

01:35:42.988 --> 01:35:45.990
Jesus Christ, Ellery,
how can you be cold?

01:35:45.991 --> 01:35:48.451
We're in the middle
of a goddamn desert!

01:35:50.162 --> 01:35:51.954
Max, I gotta sit.

01:35:51.955 --> 01:35:54.415
All right, go ahead and sit down.

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:02.924
Hey, Max?

01:36:06.178 --> 01:36:08.137
- What happened?
- Max, I think I'm shot.

01:36:08.138 --> 01:36:10.014
Let me see.

01:36:10.015 --> 01:36:12.684
- I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.

01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:24.195
My psychiatrist is not
gonna like this, Max.

01:36:28.742 --> 01:36:30.535
I'm cold.

01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:35.331
You know, while it was all
happening in there, Max

01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:38.543
I felt good again.

01:36:38.877 --> 01:36:40.711
It was like it used to be.

01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:42.671
Ellery, don't talk,
save your strength.

01:36:42.672 --> 01:36:45.049
- Save your strength.
- Why?

01:36:46.176 --> 01:36:49.429
I like to talk, Max. You know me.

01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:52.724
You gotta get it out, right?

01:36:57.145 --> 01:36:59.230
Tell me the truth.

01:37:01.066 --> 01:37:03.401
Is there something wrong with me?

01:37:03.777 --> 01:37:07.404
Ellery, listen to me. Listen to me.

01:37:07.405 --> 01:37:10.366
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:37:11.034 --> 01:37:13.869
- You mean it?
- Yeah. Listen to me.

01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:16.914
- You wouldn't lie to me, right, Max?
- No, no, no.

01:37:16.957 --> 01:37:19.709
We're partners, right?
We're partners.

01:37:21.962 --> 01:37:23.254
- Partners.
- Yeah.

01:37:23.255 --> 01:37:25.715
- Right.
- That's right.

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:28.467
We're partners, Max.

01:37:28.468 --> 01:37:31.512
No, come on, Ellery. Come on,
come on, stay awake.

01:37:31.513 --> 01:37:33.097
No, no. Come on, come on, come on.

01:37:33.098 --> 01:37:35.099
Stay awake. Come on, come on.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.769
Stay awake! Come on back!

01:37:40.146 --> 01:37:42.273
Ellery, come on!

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:04.999
I hear they broke up the squad.

01:40:05.583 --> 01:40:07.919
I broke up the squad.

01:40:11.923 --> 01:40:14.759
There's no squad without Ellery.

01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:20.765
What are you gonna do?

01:40:24.853 --> 01:40:26.812
I don't know.

01:40:27.272 --> 01:40:29.649
I honestly don't know.

01:40:38.366 --> 01:40:42.036
Did you ever think about
leaving me for her, Max?

01:40:44.372 --> 01:40:47.208
No, Kate. No.

01:40:49.127 --> 01:40:51.671
Why'd you stop seeing her?

01:40:54.215 --> 01:40:56.342
Kate, I love you.

01:40:56.718 --> 01:40:59.178
I have always loved you.

01:41:01.264 --> 01:41:04.267
When I realized what
a mistake I had made,

01:41:05.935 --> 01:41:08.688
I just didn't want it between us.

01:41:15.153 --> 01:41:18.656
But... It is.

01:41:23.453 --> 01:41:25.997
I guess it always will be.

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:35.256
It'll never be the same, Max.

01:41:40.678 --> 01:41:43.472
- Let's go, Eddie.
- Let's get out of here.

01:42:01.741 --> 01:42:05.202
You broke my heart, Max.
