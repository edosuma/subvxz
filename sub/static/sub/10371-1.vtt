01:19.997 --> 01:23.332
Fire!
Fire in the hole.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.960
Fire in the hole!

01:31.925 --> 01:35.052
Let's get it, boys.
Always loads easy on payday.

02:18.430 --> 02:22.934
Hi, Daddy. Look at your knee. Daddy,
why don't you wear your knee pad?

02:23.602 --> 02:26.646
Oh, Loretty,
that old shaft's so low,

02:26.730 --> 02:29.649
you wear your knee pads,
you skin your back.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.235
If you don't wear 'em,
you skin your knees.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.404
I'll wear 'em tomorrow
and give my back a turn.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.742
Boys, there ain't no
place this thing can't take me.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.286
There ain't a creek she can't
ford, a gully she can't jump

02:42.371 --> 02:43.579
or a hill she can't climb.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.040
By God, I know a thing
that you can't climb.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.917
That heap of red dog
back yonder.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.752
Oh, hell, buddy,
I can climb that damn mess

02:49.837 --> 02:50.878
in a by-God
New York minute.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.713
Shit!
Hey!

02:52.798 --> 02:56.384
You boys watch your language
in front of these kids.

02:58.846 --> 03:03.266
All right, does anybody wanna bet me
I can't climb that mess up there?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.725
That great
pile up there?

03:04.810 --> 03:06.727
Hell, yes, buddy!
I can ride up there at the top...

03:06.812 --> 03:09.313
Oh, I'm sorry, little girl. Excuse me.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.440
Never done.
Can't be done.

03:11.525 --> 03:15.152
I got me $25 that says I can do it.
Does anybody wanna bet me?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.948
I'll take all bets.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.410
Okay, come on, kids.
Let's get to the store.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.454
Give the company
their money back.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.083
Loretta, come on, honey.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.215
Hi, Ted.
Hey, Carl.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.468
Who's that
soldier boy out there

03:39.553 --> 03:41.470
strutting around
like a banty rooster?

03:42.472 --> 03:45.266
It's old man Red Lynn's
boy. Doolittle.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.977
Come back from the army
acting like a wild heathen.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.857
He'll calm down as soon as they
slap a coal shovel in his hand.

03:52.941 --> 03:53.941
Yeah.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.819
That Sears Roebuck
I ordered come in yet?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.321
Yeah, I'll get it for you.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.073
All right.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.243
Loretty, get you and Herman
a jar of vyannies, honey.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.328
Great!

04:20.677 --> 04:23.012
Get your mule, son.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.598
Hey, Cousin Ted,

04:25.682 --> 04:28.768
come on in here and get in on this bet.
It's a sure thing.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.436
OI' Doolittle will
never get up there

04:30.520 --> 04:32.521
without rolling over
and killin' himself.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.605
Lord have mercy,
that son of a gun Doolittle

05:14.690 --> 05:16.482
don't know what
quit means, does he?

05:16.566 --> 05:18.234
He sure went to
a lot of trouble

05:18.318 --> 05:19.944
to get on top of
a pile of junk.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.739
Come on, Herman.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.660
Mommy, Daddy's home!

05:27.744 --> 05:29.704
What you got
in that box?

05:29.788 --> 05:33.666
Something special.
Don't open it till we get inside.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.260
Y'all get washed up
before you come in.

05:44.928 --> 05:48.180
Y'all hear your Mama?
Everybody go wash now. Come on.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.150
Lee Dollarhide?

06:00.444 --> 06:04.071
Come on in here, Doo.
I was just about to blast you one.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.497
Old boy down at the store
said you wanted to see me.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.624
Here, take you a sip.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.129
Okay, fellas.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.507
Donald Ray.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.468
Thanks, Daddy.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.137
Jack, well...
Hand that to brother Jack.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.764
Thank you.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.057
Take the baby, Jack.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.850
How do they feel, gang?

06:33.602 --> 06:35.519
Daddy,
Peggy got two right feet.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.645
What?

06:36.730 --> 06:37.730
I mean, two right shoes.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.358
I'll be darned. Don't worry.
We'll get 'em changed.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.777
How they feel?
Loretta.

06:44.821 --> 06:48.574
Get your hands off. Leave 'em
alone. Leave 'em alone, Donald Ray.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.162
Daddy.

06:53.288 --> 06:57.249
Hey, how come she gets
something extra?

06:57.334 --> 07:01.128
Jack, Loretta's getting to be a woman.
Going on 14.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.422
Women's 'sposed to
have pretty things.

07:03.507 --> 07:06.467
Oh, she ain't no woman.
She ain't nothing but a dad-burned kid.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.970
Well, what are you, Herman?

07:23.902 --> 07:26.904
Remember when
you used to work for me,

07:26.988 --> 07:28.531
sell my goods down at the mine?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.784
Yeah, I remember you used to pay
me a nickel for every jug I sold.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.786
How'd you like to
come back to work for me?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.704
Not for no nickel a jug!

07:38.083 --> 07:40.000
I'm talking about
real money, Doo.

07:40.085 --> 07:44.213
Business is good, you see. I'm selling
more whiskey than I can make.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.132
But I heard you'd
been stealing some

07:46.216 --> 07:47.758
from the boys
over in Greasy Creek.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.844
Oh, just when
I run shy of my own.

07:53.223 --> 07:56.308
I'm fixing to make me another
run on Greasy Creek, Doo.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.353
You got that jeep.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.398
You know how to use a gun
and you can use you a job.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.484
I'll go 50-50 with you.

08:08.905 --> 08:13.075
Doo, if you're born in the
mountains, you got three choices,

08:13.785 --> 08:19.456
coal mine, moonshine
or moving on down the line.

08:23.211 --> 08:26.297
I'm walkin'
the floor over you

08:27.424 --> 08:31.260
I can't sleep a wink,
that is true

08:32.554 --> 08:35.347
Herman, get your feet off!

08:35.432 --> 08:39.101
Turn the radio off.
We can't afford no new batteries.

08:42.606 --> 08:45.900
You got one of your bad
headaches again, Daddy?

08:45.984 --> 08:48.194
Ted, you want me to mix
you up some medicine?

08:48.278 --> 08:50.571
It don't do no good.
It'll pass.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.240
What you see in
them grounds, Mommy?

08:53.325 --> 08:54.867
Loretty,
take the baby, hon.

08:54.951 --> 08:59.288
I see a woman crying.
Looks to me like a man crying, too.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.998
Who are they?

09:02.667 --> 09:03.834
Loretty.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.213
What are they
crying about, Mommy?

09:07.297 --> 09:10.341
Take the baby out
and rock her, Loretty.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.761
Bad times is a-coming.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.223
Well, we don't need no
fortune-teller to know that.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.477
In the pines, in the pines

09:21.603 --> 09:24.688
Where the sun never shines

09:24.981 --> 09:29.985
And I shiver
when the cold wind blows

09:31.196 --> 09:34.365
The longest train

09:34.532 --> 09:37.368
I ever saw

09:37.661 --> 09:42.248
Was on that Georgia line

09:43.291 --> 09:46.377
The purtiest boy

09:46.503 --> 09:49.255
I ever saw

09:49.839 --> 09:54.677
Was on that caboose behind

09:55.387 --> 09:56.887
In the pines...

10:24.165 --> 10:26.583
Good thing you wasn't
still working for him, son.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.002
You'd be laying there
aside him.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.378
I know that, Daddy.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.297
Course if you had have
been working for him,

10:31.381 --> 10:33.882
at least you'd have
been working somewhere.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.273
You're out.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.192
That's all right, sweetheart,
you did fine.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.738
Get up and dance!

11:43.161 --> 11:46.622
Preacher Banks was supposed to be
here to auction off these pies.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.374
And he's sick and I...

11:48.458 --> 11:51.668
I sure can't take no
time to auction no pies.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.046
Besides, if these girls want
to eat pies with a boy,

11:54.130 --> 11:55.964
they'll do it whether
there's an auction or not.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.928
Say, lady, I'll auction
off them pies for you.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.679
You will?
I sure will.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.100
Six bits? Got six bits right there.
Who's gonna bid a dollar?

12:06.184 --> 12:07.267
I will!

12:07.352 --> 12:08.727
All right, now we got
a dollar right here, now.

12:08.812 --> 12:12.314
It's a dollar one time.
Boys, that's a dollar twice.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.983
That's sold, right there, for a dollar.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.112
Give me that
dollar right there.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.655
Thank you.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.163
All right, you all
got one more pie left.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.457
It's a chocolate pie
here, belong to

12:30.542 --> 12:32.000
Loretta Webb.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.837
Who's gonna bid first?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.339
I bid two bits.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.007
Two bits?
Buddy, that's an insult!

12:39.300 --> 12:43.387
Who's gonna start off with a dollar?
Who'll give me a dollar, now?

12:46.349 --> 12:47.891
I guess I get it, then.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.853
Heck, I'll bid a dollar, buddy.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.063
You're the auctioneer.
You ain't supposed to bid.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.107
Oh, all right, that's a dollar
once, that's a dollar twice...

12:55.191 --> 12:56.358
Hey, a dollar and a dime.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.526
Three dollars.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.112
That ain't fair, he's cheating!

13:00.196 --> 13:01.780
All right,
that's $3 once, $3 twice...

13:01.865 --> 13:03.365
Three and a dime.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.159
$3.75.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.910
$3.77.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.665
$5.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.292
Ooh!

13:15.378 --> 13:17.546
Once, twice, sold to
Mr. Doolittle Lynn for $5.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.220
Play in the
house and play in the sea

13:26.473 --> 13:28.724
And when that
pretty girl turns to me

13:30.435 --> 13:32.352
Swing her high
and swing her low

13:34.230 --> 13:36.231
Swing your partner, do-si-do

13:37.984 --> 13:40.110
Takes that lamb and
takes that squirrel

13:41.446 --> 13:43.572
Takes that pretty
girl round the world

13:54.250 --> 13:56.293
Make a lot of
chocolate pies, Loretta?

13:56.377 --> 13:58.378
Not too many, except this one.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.097
How much salt did
that recipe call for?

14:09.182 --> 14:12.976
You don't put no salt in a chocolate pie.
You just put in sugar and...

14:14.979 --> 14:16.939
Well, you must have got 'em
mixed up, Loretta.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.193
Makes a lot of sense, though.
The salt and sugar's both white.

14:33.957 --> 14:37.626
Well, there ain't no sense in
walking when you can ride. Come on!

14:37.710 --> 14:39.211
I ain't gettin' in that thing.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.421
You ain't never rode
in a car before, have you?

14:41.506 --> 14:45.300
That ain't no car.
Looks like something from Mars.

14:45.385 --> 14:50.013
Mars? Gal, what the hell do
you know about Mars anyway?

14:50.098 --> 14:52.891
I'll bet you ain't never been
past the mouth of this hollow.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.603
Come on now, get in this thing.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.523
I said I ain't gettin'
in it and I ain't!

14:59.607 --> 15:02.442
If you like me so much,
you can walk me home.

15:03.820 --> 15:07.948
Oh, Lord, them pies ain't the only
thing salty about you, are they?

15:08.032 --> 15:10.242
Wait a minute! Wait,
we'll walk it, then. Wait!

15:14.414 --> 15:16.540
You know, the first time
I ever seen you I said,

15:16.624 --> 15:19.293
"Me and that little ol' gal's
gonna get together."

15:19.377 --> 15:22.462
I saw you, too,
in that little soldier suit.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.425
I thought you looked just
like a little toy soldier.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.261
Hey, now, you listen here, I went
ashore over yonder at D-day plus four

15:29.345 --> 15:31.471
and I stayed in combat until the
day the damn thing was over.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.765
I wasn't no
little ol' toy soldier.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.103
You know what
D-day is, don't you?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.358
What?
Never mind.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.824
Tell you one thing
that army showed me.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.577
There's a whole
big world out yonder.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.081
Showed me I ain't
about to spend my life

15:58.166 --> 16:00.959
buried in no
coal mine, neither.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.003
Ain't no future in it,
not a damn bit.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.632
And that's what I'm interested in,
mainly, course, is the future.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.842
You got any
plans for the future?

16:10.219 --> 16:13.388
Not that I know of.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.016
You sure cuss a lot, don't ya?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.267
Yeah, I do.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.645
Cuss, drink, chase wild women.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.480
What? What are you doing?

16:21.564 --> 16:26.068
I'm gonna kiss you good night.
Ain't you ever been kissed before. Huh?

16:42.585 --> 16:44.252
Hey, Loretta?

16:44.337 --> 16:47.005
I'm gonna bring my jeep up
here and take you for a ride.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.216
You ain't gonna get
that thing up this holler.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.760
There ain't nothing I can't do,
girl, once I set my mind to it.

16:57.767 --> 17:01.478
Loretty, honey, take
Peggy Sue in and feed her.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.146
Come on.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.656
Stranger coming!
Stranger coming!

17:13.907 --> 17:20.079
Stranger coming!

17:22.250 --> 17:23.750
What is it?

17:28.589 --> 17:30.882
I told you I'd get
this thing up here, gal.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.676
You gotta take
a ride with me now.

18:12.675 --> 18:13.759
Hey, Bill.

18:13.843 --> 18:14.843
Hey, Doo.

18:52.215 --> 18:55.133
I can't breathe.
I feel like I'm gonna faint.

18:55.218 --> 18:57.385
Well, that's the way you're supposed
to feel when you're in love.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.221
It is?
Yeah.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.412
Where have you been?

19:26.374 --> 19:27.707
Doolittle took me riding.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.084
What?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.627
Doolittle took me riding.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.420
Took you riding?

19:32.505 --> 19:36.174
You just run off.
Didn't ask nobody or nothing.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.386
Run off and worry
everybody to death.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.524
Y'all get to bed.
Go on.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.460
Don't you know he'd
rather cut off his arm

20:12.545 --> 20:14.421
than have to
whip you like that?

20:15.965 --> 20:18.633
What you mean running off
like that with that wild boy?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.969
I love him, Mommy.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.472
You do no such a thing.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.932
Stay away from that
Doolittle Lynn

20:26.017 --> 20:28.351
or I'll give you worse than
what your Daddy did.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.356
I'll go make you up
some salve for your legs.

21:13.189 --> 21:18.902
Loretty, you know I don't like to
boss you, but I got to now, honey.

21:18.986 --> 21:19.986
Daddy, I...

21:20.071 --> 21:21.905
Just let me talk.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.199
Doolittle's been up the
house every day this week.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.284
I don't want him
hanging around no more.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.494
Why?

21:28.204 --> 21:31.581
'Cause you ain't got no business
hanging around with him.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.751
You're just a little girl,
he's a grown-up man,

21:35.127 --> 21:37.545
wild as the devil.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.756
I love him, Daddy.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.675
And he's a-wanting me
to marry him.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.721
You ain't even 14 yet.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.850
Y'all ain't knowed
each other a month.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.354
I know. But I love him.

21:55.564 --> 21:59.317
Lord, Lord,
don't do it, Loretty.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.570
Don't throw all
them young years away.

22:03.406 --> 22:06.574
You're my pride, girl.
My shining pride.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.372
I just can't help it.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.000
I can't.

22:23.759 --> 22:24.759
Okay.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.429
Okay.

22:28.973 --> 22:32.600
Presenting
the Grand Ole Opry.

22:32.727 --> 22:35.103
Let her go, boys.

22:36.814 --> 22:39.816
Get up, Mommy.
Do your squaw dance.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.902
See if we can't get a smile
out of old sourpuss here.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.279
Yeah, come on, Mama.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.739
Come on, dance.

22:45.823 --> 22:47.615
Come on, Clary.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.378
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'

23:01.297 --> 23:04.883
Shine on the one that's
gone and left me blue

23:05.468 --> 23:08.803
Blue moon of Kentucky
keep on shinin'

23:09.638 --> 23:13.308
Shine on the one that's
gone and left me blue

23:13.768 --> 23:17.854
It was on a moonlit night
The stars shining bright

23:19.774 --> 23:22.275
They whispered from high
Your love said goodbye

23:22.359 --> 23:25.904
Blue moon of Kentucky
keep on shinin'

23:26.530 --> 23:28.990
Shine on the one that's gone...

23:29.200 --> 23:32.827
I knocked, but I reckon
y'all couldn't hear me outside.

23:44.590 --> 23:45.965
Guess I broke up the party.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.342
Oh, it don't matter.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.969
Come on and sit down.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.097
Okay, come on, Donald Ray.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.849
Mmm. Why don't
you try that one?

23:54.934 --> 23:55.934
Y'all get out of
here or I'm gonna

23:56.018 --> 23:57.894
knock the tar out
of every one of you.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.270
Why? We're
playing checkers.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.605
Jack, go on.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.690
Say, "Please."
Herman?

24:03.692 --> 24:07.112
Junior, come on,
take 'em out. Please?

24:08.030 --> 24:09.114
Come on, fellas, let's go.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.657
Pretty please.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.870
Look here at this, Loretty.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.207
My gosh, Doo.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.501
Where'd you get all that?

24:21.585 --> 24:23.545
Mess of paychecks.
I've been saving 'em.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.464
You know what tomorrow is?
It's our anniversary.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.260
Get a little closer.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.720
Herman, I'm gonna kill you!

24:36.642 --> 24:37.892
What were you saying, Doo?

24:37.977 --> 24:40.645
I was saying that tomorrow
is our anniversary.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.940
I figured that'd be a good day
for you and me to get married,

24:44.024 --> 24:46.651
especially since
I got all that money.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.909
Go ask Daddy.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.508
Mr. Webb,
me and Loretta

25:10.593 --> 25:13.303
is fixing to get married
if it's all right with you.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.930
Tomorrow.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.982
Go ask Clary.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.998
Mrs. Webb, uh, me...

25:43.751 --> 25:47.295
Me and Loretty was thinking
about getting married.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.963
Tomorrow.

25:52.426 --> 25:54.427
Go ask Ted.

26:06.649 --> 26:09.317
Where's lover boy?

26:11.528 --> 26:13.279
Doolittle, what are you doing?

26:13.364 --> 26:17.825
Hell, Ted said to ask Clary and Clary
said to ask Ted and... I don't know.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.286
Come on and sit down.

26:22.373 --> 26:24.874
Wait'll they go to bed, then
you can catch them together,

26:24.959 --> 26:27.669
else they'll keep you running
back and forth all night long.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.673
Mr. And Mrs. Webb?

26:36.512 --> 26:39.472
I know everything's
happened real fast.

26:39.556 --> 26:42.183
I know she's young, I know
how much y'all love her,

26:42.309 --> 26:48.189
but the deal is
I love her, too.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.733
Just as much as you do.

26:52.486 --> 26:56.030
I growed up real fast,
I seen a lot of the world.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.824
I want you to know
first time I seen that girl

26:57.908 --> 27:00.743
I said, "That's all I'm ever
gonna want out of life."

27:01.704 --> 27:03.413
And I promise you

27:04.331 --> 27:07.583
I'm gonna break my back
working to make her happy.

27:09.878 --> 27:12.922
I reckon y'all set on it
no matter what we say.

27:14.550 --> 27:15.967
I don't wanna go
against y'all, Mrs. Webb,

27:16.051 --> 27:17.427
but, yes, I'm really set on it.

27:22.224 --> 27:25.310
Two things I want
you to promise me, boy.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.521
Don't you never hit her

27:28.605 --> 27:31.399
and don't take her off
far away from home.

27:32.318 --> 27:36.070
Yes, sir.
I promise you that.

28:04.892 --> 28:06.851
Wilt thou love her,
comfort her,

28:06.935 --> 28:08.978
honor and keep her
in sickness and in health

28:09.063 --> 28:11.647
and forsaking all other,
keep thee only unto her

28:11.732 --> 28:13.649
so long as you both shall live?

28:13.734 --> 28:15.151
I will.

28:15.235 --> 28:18.196
And, Loretta, wilt thou have this
man to be thy wedded husband,

28:18.280 --> 28:21.157
to live together in the
holy estate of matrimony?

28:21.283 --> 28:23.242
Wilt thou love him,
comfort him,

28:23.327 --> 28:25.203
honor and keep him
in sickness and in health

28:25.329 --> 28:28.122
and forsaking all other,
keep thee only unto him

28:28.207 --> 28:29.957
so long as you both shall live?

28:30.084 --> 28:32.043
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I will.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.296
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

28:37.674 --> 28:39.884
I do.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.969
Please join right hands.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.350
The wedding ring is
an outward and visible sign

28:47.434 --> 28:49.227
of an inward
and spiritual grace

28:49.311 --> 28:51.396
signifying unto all the uniting

28:51.480 --> 28:53.481
of this man and this
woman in holy matrimony.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.110
Do you two have rings?

28:57.194 --> 28:58.986
I ain't got
no ring, Judge.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.965
She'll warm up here
in just a minute.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.259
I got a present
for you from Mama.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.876
Well, go on, get ready
for bed, baby, come on.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.371
Loretta, you ain't supposed to wear
a nightgown over your clothes.

30:32.456 --> 30:33.998
I'm freezing, Doo.

30:35.542 --> 30:40.463
Get on in there and take off
everything, but your nightgown now.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.507
Go on, Loretty.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.175
Go on!

30:44.259 --> 30:46.260
Move. Go on, now.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.057
Get off.

31:33.141 --> 31:36.269
Don't do that.
Don't! Doo, no!

31:36.353 --> 31:39.230
It's just a little rough the
first time, Loretty, is all.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.399
Don't worry about that.
Come on, baby.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.276
Don't, Doo. No!

31:43.360 --> 31:44.610
Hush, Loretty.

31:44.695 --> 31:45.861
No, Doo!

31:45.946 --> 31:47.822
No! No.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.440
This stuff's cold.

32:23.692 --> 32:26.360
It's because it froze between
here and the damn restaurant.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.696
You want a hot breakfast,
you got to go with me.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.656
I ain't going in there having
all them people looking at me

32:30.741 --> 32:32.783
knowing what we've
been doing in here.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.621
Hell's bells, Loretta, do
you think this is something

32:36.705 --> 32:38.372
the rest of the world
ain't caught on to yet?

32:38.457 --> 32:39.999
They don't give a damn.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.712
Baby, it's just a little rough
the first time, that's all.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.380
Didn't seem too rough on you.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.757
Well, you better get
used to it, darling,

32:47.841 --> 32:49.300
because that's what
a damn marriage...

32:49.384 --> 32:54.096
I ain't gonna get used to you getting
on me and sweating like an old pig!

32:57.059 --> 33:00.895
You told Daddy you wouldn't hit
me and look at you already.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.565
Well, hell, I'm sorry, Loretta,
but you drove me to it!

33:35.597 --> 33:37.556
Hi, hon.

33:44.898 --> 33:48.359
Look here at this. These
radios are on sale real cheap.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.569
You reckon we could get us one?

33:58.620 --> 34:02.331
Here, you read that.
Then we'll talk radios.

34:05.127 --> 34:07.878
My gosh, Doo, this has
got pictures in it.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.719
Ugh!

34:20.434 --> 34:21.891
Here, dog.

34:35.072 --> 34:38.242
Oh, Loretty, that there book,

34:40.495 --> 34:44.498
that thing's helped millions
of people the world over.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.958
I thought it might
do us a little good.

34:47.377 --> 34:51.589
I can't read this book, Doo. It's got
all 'em great big ol' words in it.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.300
Look at this one. Look.

34:54.384 --> 34:57.219
That dadgum word
is a foot long.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.872
Now, what's a foot-long
word supposed to mean, huh?

35:08.607 --> 35:11.358
Oh, Doo, I don't need no book
to tell me what's wrong.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.694
You just need to be
a little more patient

35:13.779 --> 35:15.571
and gentle with me,
honey, that's all.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.366
I just need a little more time.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.162
Give you a little more time.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.122
Well, let me add up
all these damn things

35:25.207 --> 35:26.624
I'm supposed to give
you some more time on.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.709
You need a little more time
to learn how to cook.

35:30.212 --> 35:32.755
You need a little more time to
learn how to clean the damn house.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.258
Plus you need
a little more time to learn

35:36.343 --> 35:37.843
how to love your man
the way you're supposed to.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.513
Goddamn, is there anything that
you know how to do right now?

35:44.226 --> 35:46.393
Doo, when you gonna get me
that wedding ring?

35:47.896 --> 35:51.941
Stop making that noise.
You sound like an old bear growling.

35:53.401 --> 35:56.695
Where are you going?
Doo, are you leaving?

36:04.037 --> 36:07.164
No, I ain't leaving.

36:10.418 --> 36:13.754
Mommy,
look who's here! Loretta!

36:15.799 --> 36:17.758
Hi. Hi, Peggy.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.510
Hi, Donald.

36:19.594 --> 36:22.847
Look who's here, Dad!

36:24.182 --> 36:26.934
Hi, Mommy.
Doo's thrown me out, Mommy.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.603
Oh, thank the Lord.
Maybe it ain't too late

36:29.688 --> 36:31.522
to save you from
ruining your life.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.773
Loretty, you home!

36:32.858 --> 36:34.024
Hi, Daddy.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.150
Mmm!

36:35.569 --> 36:38.237
I believe married life's
making you fat, girl.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.032
Oh, no.

36:42.659 --> 36:45.286
F, O, D...

36:45.537 --> 36:47.204
Ready, Loretta?

36:50.458 --> 36:51.625
The last time I seen you

36:51.710 --> 36:53.669
I was giving you kids
a shot for the measles.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.630
Here you are an old married woman.
How do you like it?

36:56.715 --> 36:58.465
Fine.

37:00.969 --> 37:03.679
Except me and Doo is separated.

37:05.056 --> 37:08.893
Things happen pretty fast between
you and Doo, don't they?

37:32.500 --> 37:33.667
Hey!

37:34.711 --> 37:36.170
Hold up there.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.882
Hey, Doolittle, how are you?

37:40.508 --> 37:41.634
Good day, isn't it?

37:41.718 --> 37:42.843
It sure is.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.428
What have you been doing?

37:44.512 --> 37:48.223
No, not a hell of a lot. Working
too goddamn hard. What about you?

37:48.350 --> 37:50.225
Hey, Doolittle Lynn.

37:51.353 --> 37:53.479
Who's that sow
wallowing in your jeep?

37:53.563 --> 37:55.022
What did you call me?

37:55.106 --> 37:57.566
A sow.
That's a woman pig.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.160
Hi, Loretta, I just...

38:08.370 --> 38:10.245
Hey, Loretta!

38:15.919 --> 38:18.462
Hey, Loretta!
I was just fixing to come see you.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.130
Was you gonna bring
your girlfriend with you?

38:20.215 --> 38:22.299
Oh, hell, that don't mean nothing.
She just flagged me down.

38:22.384 --> 38:23.634
I got something
to tell you, girl.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.844
Yeah, I got something
to tell you, too.

38:27.847 --> 38:30.057
Loretta, I am leaving Kentucky.

38:31.601 --> 38:32.935
I'm going out west
to Washington

38:33.019 --> 38:34.269
to get me a job on
a ranch or something.

38:34.354 --> 38:37.147
That damned ol' coal mine's
got me buried alive.

38:38.358 --> 38:39.733
Was you just gonna leave me?

38:39.818 --> 38:41.694
Just long enough to get the
money to send for you.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.487
What makes you think I'd come?

38:43.571 --> 38:44.947
'Cause you're my wife, darling.

38:45.031 --> 38:48.951
I'm your wife! Boy, you better think
of a better reason than that.

38:49.411 --> 38:52.746
There ain't nothing for me
in Kentucky, Loretta.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.498
Except a chest
full of coal dust

38:54.582 --> 38:56.417
and being an old man
time I'm 40.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.920
You ask your daddy.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.923
'Sides that, you got to
come with me, I love you.

39:04.592 --> 39:07.511
You promised Daddy you wouldn't
take me off far from home.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.847
Well, you just have to
make up your mind, darling,

39:09.931 --> 39:12.599
whether or not you're
his daughter or my wife.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.147
Get in. I'll take
you back to the house.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.360
What are you doing
in the bottom anyhow?

39:23.445 --> 39:25.904
I come to see Doc Turner.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.823
You sick?

39:27.907 --> 39:30.117
Yeah, I'm gonna have a baby.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.664
Oh, Lord, Loretta.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.959
You know, darlin', you
might have found something

39:39.044 --> 39:40.794
that you know how to do.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.072
It's from Doo, Daddy!

40:08.156 --> 40:10.741
He sent me the money
to come to Washington.

40:24.089 --> 40:28.425
Well, she's late. Reckon she
might have jumped the tracks.

40:28.510 --> 40:32.930
Oh, Daddy, them things don't do that.
Do they?

40:34.349 --> 40:36.350
They've been known to.

40:38.728 --> 40:41.188
Get up here.
Let's see what you weigh.

40:48.363 --> 40:51.031
117?

40:51.116 --> 40:54.868
Boy, Daddy, this baby's gonna be a
big one, ain't it? You weigh now.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.371
It wouldn't do no good.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.164
I wouldn't know
how much was me,

40:59.249 --> 41:01.375
how much was all that
coal dust I swallowed.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.679
I ain't never
gonna see you again.

41:14.389 --> 41:16.390
Yes, you will, Daddy.

41:17.225 --> 41:21.061
Maybe. But I ain't never gonna
see my little girl again.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.358
Them years has
been robbed from me,

41:26.442 --> 41:28.861
like a thief broke in
and robbed 'em.

41:45.962 --> 41:49.464
As I listen to the words

41:49.757 --> 41:53.218
You are saying

41:54.179 --> 41:56.346
It brings memories

41:56.431 --> 42:01.935
When I was a trusting wife

42:02.270 --> 42:05.314
It wasn't God

42:05.398 --> 42:09.860
Who made honky tonk angels...

42:10.069 --> 42:11.612
Thank you, Betty Sue.

42:11.696 --> 42:15.741
As you said in the words

42:16.034 --> 42:18.827
Of your song

42:19.162 --> 42:22.289
Ernest Ray, your daddy
is gonna wear you out

42:22.373 --> 42:23.415
when he gets home.

42:23.499 --> 42:27.794
...married men
think they're still single

42:34.260 --> 42:36.386
Y'all scared of the rain?
You ain't gonna melt.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.305
Let's go to work, boys.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.294
Come here, boy. Come here.
Come here, my little...

42:45.146 --> 42:46.647
Daddy, Daddy!

42:46.731 --> 42:48.357
How you doing, Bo?

42:49.943 --> 42:52.736
Hello, darlin'.
Come here, baby.

42:54.989 --> 42:57.032
What did you do all day, baby?

42:57.158 --> 43:00.118
Well, I put up 17 quarts
of this apple butter.

43:00.203 --> 43:02.704
And, Doo,
the dadgum sink stopped up.

43:02.789 --> 43:05.165
And I spent half
the morning fixing that.

43:06.251 --> 43:09.670
Jack Benny, stop kicking
him under the table.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.255
Do you hear me?

43:11.339 --> 43:13.757
And then I had that
doctor's appointment.

43:14.634 --> 43:16.009
He said it was a false alarm.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.136
We'd better be a whole lot
more careful next time.

43:18.304 --> 43:20.681
Let's cover your
mouth when you're coughing.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.809
And then I come home.

43:23.893 --> 43:25.352
Eat, boy.

43:25.770 --> 43:27.688
Betty Sue, you are
not leaving this table

43:27.772 --> 43:29.439
till you finish that,
do you hear me?

43:29.524 --> 43:30.732
You were eating all day.
Sit up there.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.276
Sit up. Come here.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.403
Then I come home
and cooked supper.

43:34.487 --> 43:36.196
And I'm about ready to die.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.824
How was your day?
Wet.

43:44.831 --> 43:45.956
Hey, Mooney!

43:46.040 --> 43:47.082
Yo!

43:47.542 --> 43:50.544
Your mama called long
distance from Kentucky today,

43:50.628 --> 43:54.881
said happy anniversary and said why
don't you call her more often.

43:55.591 --> 43:57.592
Much obliged.

43:57.677 --> 44:01.305
Why don't you have a phone
put in sometime, Mooney?

44:01.389 --> 44:03.557
Really don't like telephones.

44:07.353 --> 44:10.897
The captain,
he must have been drinkin'

44:11.774 --> 44:14.901
For he knew that
he had done wrong

44:15.820 --> 44:19.823
He was trying to win the record

44:20.742 --> 44:23.952
When he let the Titanic go down

44:25.204 --> 44:28.665
The children were cryin',
"Dear Mother"

44:29.792 --> 44:33.462
Dear Mother has gone to stay

44:34.005 --> 44:37.424
But maybe it'll
turn to somethin'...

44:37.550 --> 44:39.301
Close your eyes, Cissy.

44:39.552 --> 44:43.180
...that'll raise
the Titanic some day

44:44.307 --> 44:47.559
Do-do di-do-do do-do-do...

44:51.481 --> 44:55.442
Baby, I was just thinking,
we got an anniversary coming up,

44:55.526 --> 44:59.112
I was wondering what kind of
anniversary present you wanted.

45:01.949 --> 45:04.242
Well, I ain't got
no wedding ring yet.

45:04.327 --> 45:07.788
Wedding ring? Bullshit.

45:08.331 --> 45:09.623
Oh, bullshit!

45:09.707 --> 45:11.792
Doo! Jack Benny!

45:13.044 --> 45:15.754
Now, go to sleep, Ernest Ray.
You, too, Jack Benny.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.151
Happy anniversary, darlin'.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.489
Yeah, it looks like
you had a happy one.

45:44.659 --> 45:48.286
You know, Doo, most couples spend
their anniversary together.

45:48.371 --> 45:51.081
What's that?

45:51.165 --> 45:54.376
That's your anniversary present, baby.
Happy anniversary.

45:54.544 --> 45:57.254
My anniversary present?
Mmm-hmm.

45:57.338 --> 46:00.257
Doo, sometimes I think you got a
washer missing in your brain.

46:00.341 --> 46:01.842
I can't play that thing.

46:01.926 --> 46:05.637
Most people can't without
they learn how first.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.849
You're not too
ignorant to learn, are you?

46:08.933 --> 46:11.810
Hell, if you don't want it,
I'll give it to the kids.

46:11.894 --> 46:12.936
They probably
don't want it either,

46:13.020 --> 46:14.396
so I'll put it in
the kindling box.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.898
Give me that.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.201
What you get me a guitar for?

46:28.286 --> 46:30.537
'Cause I like the way you sing.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.002
Do you really
think I sing good?

46:37.086 --> 46:39.087
Baby, I know you do.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.383
Can I have a present, too?

46:44.844 --> 46:51.308
Have I told you
lately that I love you?

46:53.227 --> 46:57.898
Have I...
Could I tell you once again

46:57.982 --> 47:01.359
Somehow?

47:04.238 --> 47:06.656
If you boys knock Cissy off
of this porch one more time,

47:06.741 --> 47:08.950
I'll have to whup you.

47:09.035 --> 47:10.660
That's right.

47:11.078 --> 47:13.580
No, no

47:15.958 --> 47:18.919
With all my

47:19.003 --> 47:24.925
Heart and soul how I adore you

47:25.259 --> 47:29.012
Well, darlin',
I'm tellin' you now

47:29.096 --> 47:32.182
You boys stop fighting
and listen to me sing.

47:33.518 --> 47:38.313
This heart would break
in two if you refuse me

47:39.232 --> 47:44.194
I'm no good without you anyhow

47:44.695 --> 47:49.866
Dear, have I told you
lately that I love you?

47:51.369 --> 47:55.622
Well, darlin',
I'm tellin' you now

47:55.831 --> 47:57.666
Hey, darling,
how about Saturday night

47:57.750 --> 48:00.585
let's get us one
of them babysitters

48:00.670 --> 48:02.504
and go honky-tonkin'?

48:02.588 --> 48:03.713
You mean together?

48:03.798 --> 48:05.090
Yeah,  Together.

48:05.174 --> 48:06.341
Okay.

48:12.557 --> 48:14.766
What are you grinning about?

48:16.269 --> 48:18.144
Doo!

48:19.397 --> 48:21.106
What are you up to?

48:23.109 --> 48:24.609
My Lord.

48:38.165 --> 48:42.377
I'll have one of them beers,
please, plus one Coca-Cola.

48:48.634 --> 48:50.260
How about a dance, darling?

48:50.344 --> 48:52.178
I can't. I'm married.

48:52.638 --> 48:55.682
You must not be too married,
you ain't wearing no ring.

48:58.311 --> 49:00.520
I bet I know what
this is all about.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.731
Oh, dang, you guessed it.

49:02.815 --> 49:05.191
Wait right here,
I'll be right back.

49:10.865 --> 49:13.450
Hey, buddy!
Hey, buddy, come here.

49:14.785 --> 49:17.621
I got something sitting right
on back there at that table...

49:23.085 --> 49:26.212
Come here, darling.
Come here, honey.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.928
I'll be right with you, Hoss.

49:35.181 --> 49:38.266
Excuse me.

49:42.647 --> 49:44.648
Loretta!

49:46.067 --> 49:48.902
What the hell are you doing
running off and hiding like a...

49:48.986 --> 49:52.113
Don't make me get up and sing, Doo.
Please, I'm sick.

49:52.198 --> 49:54.449
Oh, hell, you're not gonna
have to get up there and sing.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.159
That ol' boy wouldn't allow it.
Thank the Lord.

49:56.243 --> 49:57.744
You're gonna have to audition
for 'em in the morning.

49:57.828 --> 50:00.455
I ain't no singer, Doo.
I can't sing for no strangers.

50:00.539 --> 50:02.165
Yes, you can.
I done fixed it up for you.

50:02.249 --> 50:04.167
There ain't no problem.
You didn't ask me nothing about it!

50:04.251 --> 50:05.752
How the hell can I ask you
something about it

50:05.836 --> 50:07.837
if you run off and hide
like a stupid hillbilly?

50:07.922 --> 50:11.508
Don't call me that. I may be
ignorant, but I ain't stupid.

50:11.592 --> 50:13.718
Why do you want me to sing
so much for anyway?

50:13.803 --> 50:15.345
'Cause I'm proud of
you when you sing.

50:18.307 --> 50:20.517
Doo, I'm glad I
make you proud, honey,

50:20.601 --> 50:23.895
but I can't sing in front
of people. I just can't.

50:24.563 --> 50:26.272
Yes, you can, baby.

50:26.440 --> 50:29.651
You're gonna sing for these old
boys in here in the morning,

50:29.735 --> 50:31.528
and next week you're gonna
be up on that stage

50:31.612 --> 50:33.196
singing for
all these people here,

50:33.280 --> 50:35.448
if I have to kick your

50:35.533 --> 50:38.243
ignorant hillbilly ass
every step of the way!

50:44.875 --> 50:47.335
And now, folks, we've got
a special treat for you.

50:47.628 --> 50:49.879
Making her very
first public appearance,

50:49.964 --> 50:52.924
please welcome The Westerneers'
new girl singer,

50:53.008 --> 50:55.468
Miss Loretta Lynn!

51:22.621 --> 51:26.040
There he goes

51:26.876 --> 51:30.211
He's walkin' away

51:31.714 --> 51:34.674
And each step he takes

51:36.260 --> 51:38.803
Brings heartache my way

51:41.098 --> 51:44.559
She's won his heart

51:45.936 --> 51:49.189
I lost him someway

51:50.524 --> 51:54.194
There he goes

51:55.404 --> 51:58.740
He's walkin' away

52:01.368 --> 52:05.747
Oh, if I hadn't cheated

52:06.207 --> 52:09.709
And if I hadn't lied

52:11.545 --> 52:15.548
I'd be the one

52:16.342 --> 52:19.219
Who's walkin' by his side

52:19.386 --> 52:22.388
I love him still

52:24.058 --> 52:27.477
And I guess it shows

52:29.188 --> 52:32.106
The way that I feel

52:33.567 --> 52:36.569
As there he goes

52:39.365 --> 52:43.618
Oh, if I hadn't cheated

52:44.328 --> 52:47.914
And if I hadn't lied

52:50.042 --> 52:54.128
I'd be the one

52:54.255 --> 52:57.507
Who's walkin' by his side

52:57.591 --> 53:00.510
I love him still

53:02.388 --> 53:05.765
And I guess it shows

53:06.976 --> 53:10.562
The way that I feel

53:11.939 --> 53:16.025
As there he goes

53:29.123 --> 53:30.373
Darling,
you were good.

53:30.457 --> 53:31.708
You got a big voice.

53:32.459 --> 53:33.793
How'd you
like that, folks?

53:33.878 --> 53:36.212
Would you like to hear the
little lady sing another one?

53:36.297 --> 53:37.547
Doo, they liked me!

53:37.631 --> 53:38.840
Yeah, baby, they loved you.
They loved you.

53:38.924 --> 53:40.550
They gonna love you
a hell of a lot more

53:40.634 --> 53:42.176
if you get up there
and do another one, honey.

53:42.261 --> 53:44.804
Go on, do another one.
Go on.

53:46.891 --> 53:50.727
So fill my glass up to the top

53:52.813 --> 53:53.813
...star

53:54.440 --> 53:58.651
So fill my glass up to the rim

54:04.116 --> 54:05.116
...him

54:05.576 --> 54:09.287
I've lost
everything in this world

54:09.496 --> 54:13.750
And now I'm a honky tonk girl

54:14.335 --> 54:17.045
I done wrote myself a song,
Betty Sue.

54:17.129 --> 54:19.255
Your mama's
a dadgum songwriter.

54:19.340 --> 54:20.465
It's a nice song, Mommy.

54:20.549 --> 54:21.633
Thank you.

54:22.176 --> 54:25.345
Deal is, Loretta, you can sing
in every little honky tonk in the country.

54:25.429 --> 54:26.554
There's thousands doing it

54:26.639 --> 54:28.264
and they ain't getting
nowhere and they never will.

54:28.349 --> 54:31.225
The thing that's gonna give you the
edge is getting yourself a record.

54:31.310 --> 54:33.144
And the next step's even
more important than that

54:33.228 --> 54:35.104
and that's getting people to
play the dad-burned thing,

54:35.189 --> 54:38.524
but right now what you and
me have to worry about...

54:38.609 --> 54:39.776
Listen to your daddy.

54:39.860 --> 54:42.570
...is you making the best
doggone record you can,

54:42.655 --> 54:44.447
it all depends on that,
darling.

54:45.532 --> 54:46.950
Boy, Doo,
I didn't know you knew

54:47.034 --> 54:48.326
so much about
the music business.

54:48.410 --> 54:50.203
I don't. I'm just figuring
it out as I go along,

54:50.287 --> 54:52.038
listening to people talk.

54:53.248 --> 54:55.249
It's just got three chords.

55:01.006 --> 55:03.591
All right, honey, what are
you gonna sing for us?

55:03.676 --> 55:07.637
She's gonna do a song that she wrote
herself called Honky Tonk Girl.

55:07.721 --> 55:10.223
Right.
Honey, what key's it in?

55:10.349 --> 55:12.141
Y'all just go right
ahead and play along,

55:12.226 --> 55:13.977
and she'll
follow you just fine.

55:15.020 --> 55:16.270
Go ahead and y'all just play.

55:16.355 --> 55:17.897
She does talk,
don't she, partner?

55:18.107 --> 55:20.942
I mean, generally people
that can sing can talk.

55:21.026 --> 55:22.318
Oh, she'll talk up a storm
if she feels like it.

55:22.403 --> 55:23.653
All right.

55:24.071 --> 55:25.780
Y'all settle down
here now and be quiet.

55:25.906 --> 55:27.740
Darling, come over here
and sit on my knee.

55:28.784 --> 55:31.244
You'll have a lot better view, boys.
Sit up here, now.

55:31.328 --> 55:32.704
Sit up big and
listen to your mama.

55:32.788 --> 55:36.082
All right, tape is rolling, we're ready.
Let's go for take one.

55:37.251 --> 55:39.002
Three, four, one.

55:52.099 --> 55:55.184
That's all right, that's all right,
don't worry. We got a lot of tape.

55:55.269 --> 55:57.854
All right, you all, get ready and
set, and we'll go for take two.

55:57.938 --> 55:59.063
Buddy, could you give
us a minute, please?

55:59.148 --> 56:00.231
Well, sure.

56:00.315 --> 56:03.109
Kids, come along with me.
Come here.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.653
I guess we're
leaving now, so...

56:05.779 --> 56:07.905
Hey,
put that thing back on.

56:07.990 --> 56:09.824
What are you doing in
here with them kids?

56:11.201 --> 56:13.244
Doo? What are you doing?

56:13.787 --> 56:16.247
Darling, I want you to
sing to these babies.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.582
Sing to the babies?

56:17.666 --> 56:19.125
Yes, just like you was at home.

56:19.585 --> 56:21.252
I'll sit there in
that green chair.

56:21.336 --> 56:22.962
Okay.

56:23.297 --> 56:24.380
Are you sure?

56:24.465 --> 56:25.590
I'm positive.

56:37.144 --> 56:42.648
Ever since you left
me I've done nothin' but wrong

56:43.484 --> 56:48.488
Many nights
I've laid awake and cried

56:49.698 --> 56:52.909
All right, hold it, everybody.
Just hang on a minute.

56:52.993 --> 56:56.621
Let's take a little break and let me
see if I can find a few more pickers.

56:56.705 --> 56:58.122
Man, I can't afford
no more pickers.

56:58.207 --> 56:59.749
I done spent every
last penny I had.

56:59.833 --> 57:01.876
As bad as them two are,
what do you want more for?

57:01.960 --> 57:06.089
No, no, I mean more better.
That little lady sings her hind end off.

57:09.468 --> 57:15.431
Ever since you left
me I've done nothin' but wrong

57:16.350 --> 57:21.020
Many nights
I've laid awake and cried

57:23.023 --> 57:29.278
We were so happy
my heart was in a whirl

57:30.030 --> 57:33.032
Let's go, darlin'. Let's do this
thing now, I ain't got all day.

57:33.117 --> 57:35.827
Wait a minute, I ain't got all
these doodads sewed on yet.

57:35.911 --> 57:37.537
Baby, I got to get to work.
Come on, now.

57:37.621 --> 57:38.871
Okay.

57:38.956 --> 57:41.457
It's just gonna be your
head and shoulders anyhow.

57:41.542 --> 57:43.543
Get up there in
front of the backdrop.

57:43.669 --> 57:45.461
You mean that bedspread?
Yeah.

57:45.546 --> 57:47.964
Oh, wait a minute, Doo!
I ought to put on some lipstick.

57:48.090 --> 57:50.967
Get back in here. I like you better
natural. Forget the lipstick.

57:51.051 --> 57:52.385
Slip's all rotten.

57:52.469 --> 57:53.719
Sit down there.

57:54.429 --> 57:56.180
Get up on the back
of the chair, babe.

57:56.265 --> 57:57.390
Up on the back of the chair?

57:57.474 --> 57:58.724
Yeah.

58:03.981 --> 58:06.691
Oh, that's gonna be pretty.
That's gonna be pretty.

58:06.775 --> 58:08.484
I don't want you ever
wearing no lipstick,

58:08.569 --> 58:10.945
or makeup or none of
that junk, I don't like it.

58:11.029 --> 58:12.697
It ain't right.

58:14.116 --> 58:15.324
All right, here we go now.

58:15.409 --> 58:16.576
Where do you want me to look?

58:16.702 --> 58:18.578
- I want you to look at heaven, baby.
- Mama.

58:18.662 --> 58:20.872
Get out of there, sweetheart, I'm
trying to take your mama's picture.

58:20.956 --> 58:23.040
Get over there
and sit down now.

58:24.001 --> 58:25.835
Thank you, baby.

58:25.919 --> 58:27.336
Smile.

58:27.421 --> 58:28.462
Oh...

58:28.547 --> 58:32.049
Beautiful. That's just beautiful.
That's it, babe.

58:34.052 --> 58:36.179
Put the backdrop
back on the bed.

58:36.263 --> 58:38.431
Are you and Daddy going out
again tonight, Mama?

58:38.515 --> 58:40.516
Yes, honey, I've got
to sing over in Lynden.

58:40.601 --> 58:41.726
Can I go with you?

58:41.810 --> 58:45.813
Oh, no, that's a rough old honky tonk.
You can't be going over there.

59:17.971 --> 59:20.014
Did you stay up all
night again, honey?

59:20.140 --> 59:22.350
Yeah, darling,
I'll get me a nap later on.

59:22.434 --> 59:23.768
Well, let me fix
you some breakfast.

59:23.852 --> 59:25.394
No, I'll get me
a bite later on, baby.

59:25.479 --> 59:27.313
I got to go now.
You be ready when I get home.

59:27.397 --> 59:28.856
We gotta drive
all the way to Spokane.

59:28.941 --> 59:30.274
Okay. Bye-bye.

59:31.318 --> 59:33.653
Where's my egg, Mommy?

59:34.321 --> 59:36.739
I'm cooking it as fast
as I can, darling.

59:37.491 --> 59:39.075
Loretty!

59:39.159 --> 59:40.618
Loretty.

59:48.168 --> 59:50.169
Loretty!

59:52.422 --> 59:54.715
Loretty!

59:58.303 --> 01:00:02.473
Long distance!
Your ma's calling from Kentucky!

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.184
Emergency, she said.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:10.314
Amazing grace,
how sweet it sounds.

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:16.862
Amazing grace

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:23.452
How sweet it sounds

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.913
That saved
a wretch like me.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:32.586
That saved a wretch

01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:36.048
like me

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.302
I once was lost,
but now I'm found.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:44.807
He come to me, Mommy,
when he died.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:49.312
I seen him just as plain.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:52.648
You know, he wanted to be with
you and them grand-young'uns.

01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:55.067
Was blind
but now I see.

01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:58.070
Mommy, I shouldn't have left.

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:09.999
I don't guess he ever got over me
taking her off from home, Doc.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.586
You did the right thing,
Doo, leaving here.

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:18.674
Well, anyhow, it's over
and done now, I reckon.

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:25.264
No, it ain't, Doc,
it ain't never gonna be over.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:33.439
We have already come

01:01:58.173 --> 01:01:59.715
Finished widening that trail.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.968
It ain't gonna be so hard
to get up here next time.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.237
Loretta, this ol' mountain top

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.072
is gonna be covered in
wildflowers in six weeks' time,

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:25.574
what the hell are you doing
bringing plastic ones up here?

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:28.911
Because they don't die.
The real ones just die.

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:32.873
Darlin'...
Like everything else.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:37.503
Mommy's moving away,
Daddy's gone.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:41.507
I ain't gonna
have no home left.

01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:43.676
You got our home.

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:47.513
Baby.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:49.640
Get away from me!

01:02:53.145 --> 01:02:55.146
Leave me alone.

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:37.938
Loretta, we gotta
decide something.

01:03:40.775 --> 01:03:44.069
Most of them radio stations that
we sent records and pictures to

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.113
is right here in
this part of the country.

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:49.325
If we're really
gonna do this thing,

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:53.120
we gotta go see 'em in person and
make sure they play that record.

01:03:53.205 --> 01:03:57.208
I already talked to your mama and she
said she'd watch the kids for us.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:02.588
We gotta move right now,
you understand?

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.176
Darlin', if you don't want it,

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.969
I ain't gonna make you
do nothing you don't wanna do.

01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:10.596
It's your choice.

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:16.143
We'll just go back to what
we was doing, that's all.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.565
I want it.
What?

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.609
I said I want it!

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:25.945
Baby, I can't hear you!

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:29.073
I wanna be a singer, Doo!

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.158
I want it real bad.

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:35.246
I want it real bad.

01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:39.583
Jack, you see that little
row of numbers right there?

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:42.795
That tells you how many miles you've
gone, and tell us how far we've been

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:44.171
when we get back here.

01:04:44.256 --> 01:04:46.674
I love you. I'll see you
when we come home.

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:47.967
Go with Grandma.
Come on, girl.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:49.218
Mommy, I love you.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:50.469
I love you.

01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:54.431
Betty Sue, you take care
of the little ones, okay?

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:57.101
Will you mind Grandma? Okay?

01:04:57.185 --> 01:05:00.145
Bye, Jack!
Bye, Ernest Ray! Bye-bye.

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.900
I left y'all some Tootsie Rolls

01:05:04.985 --> 01:05:07.570
in the top drawer, Mommy,
in the bedroom!

01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:09.613
Bye-bye!
Bye, Mommy!

01:05:09.698 --> 01:05:11.156
Bye, Mommy!

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.200
Come back, Mommy!

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:22.835
Now here's that number
one hit, Walkin' After Midnight.

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:24.336
Patsy Cline.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.422
That's right, that's WCBL.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.674
Disc jockey name of Bobby Day.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.427
Keep your eyes open for the
transmitter, honey, it's right up here.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:33.929
The what? Oh.
The transmitter.

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:38.517
I'm always walkin' after midnight

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:42.229
Searching for you

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:49.236
I walked for miles
along the highway

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.532
Well, that's just my way

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:02.291
Dadgummit, Doo, wait a minute!
People can see in here.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:03.751
Hurry up, let's go.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.085
What am I supposed
to say when we get in there?

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:06.295
I don't know what to say.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:10.382
Don't even think about what you're
supposed to say, just start talking.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:31.028
Hey, I'm sorry, folks, there's no
visitors allowed in the studio.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:34.406
Uh... Hi, Bobby.
My name's Loretta Lynn

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:39.286
and I sent you a picture and my
newest record on the Zero label.

01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:42.247
Hey, look, no kidding, you can't be
in here while I'm doing a show, okay?

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:46.168
It's a song I wrote myself,
it's called Honky Tonk Girl.

01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:47.628
I got the idea...

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:49.630
I got it and I played it

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.465
and it just sorta
laid right there.

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:55.552
So thanks for coming in, you all.
Bye-bye, now. Bye-bye.

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.055
Bye-bye.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:02.017
You're listening to Tri-State
Country with your DJ, Bobby Day

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:04.144
right here till 6:00,
neighbors.

01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:07.940
And now here's a word from our
friends down at Hutchins' Hot Pigs.

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:11.652
Tell them all about it, Hutch,
and all of them little piglets.

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:15.447
You played it, huh? You ain't
even took it out of the wrapper.

01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:17.741
Do you know how many
do-it-yourself records

01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:19.118
I get in here every day?

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.370
If I played all of 'em, I wouldn't
have time to play anything else.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:23.414
Well, why did you lie to us?
Huh?

01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:25.416
Why'd you say
they didn't like us?

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.376
Doo worked so hard
to get us this record!

01:07:27.502 --> 01:07:30.295
Hey, buddy, get her out of here.
I gotta go back on the air.

01:07:30.422 --> 01:07:31.922
I'm sorry, buddy,
there's nothing I can do

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.299
once she gets
cranked up like this.

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:36.635
He took the picture, too.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.555
Heck, we got four babies we had
to leave home with my mommy.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:43.100
We drove all the way here,
spent every last dime we had.

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:46.019
Folks, we got a special treat
for you here today,

01:07:46.104 --> 01:07:49.022
a young lady who I predict
is gonna go all the way.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:51.567
I can't believe it!
I can't believe

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.610
you'd do something
so dadgum mean as that!

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:55.112
Tell them
all about yourself, darling.

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:56.530
About myself?

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:06.081
And then I sung it
for Doolittle. That's my husband.

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:07.958
Except everybody else calls
him Mooney on account of

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:10.586
he used to sell moonshine
back in Butcher Holler.

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:12.087
Where?
Butcher Holler,

01:08:12.172 --> 01:08:14.757
that where me and Doo's
from back in Kentucky.

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:17.551
Anyway, I wrote the song
and Doo heard it,

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:19.970
and he said, "That's about the
prettiest song as I ever heard,

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.346
"good as Patsy Cline."

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:24.767
I said, "Oh, ain't nobody
sings as good as Patsy."

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:29.020
Well, let's get a listen to it,
folks, brand-new on the Zero label,

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.981
Miss Lorene Lynn singing...
What?

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:33.108
...Honky Tonk Girl.

01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:35.778
It's Loretta Lynn, not Lorene.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.529
Loretta?
Uh-huh.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:47.956
Girl, you sure got
over being bashful fast.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:52.211
I just done what you said, just
opened my mouth and out it come.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.670
I couldn't even stop.

01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:55.171
I didn't have no more notion of

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:56.756
what I was gonna
say than a rabbit.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.634
You keep on being
a rabbit then, darlin'.

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.301
Hey, where is the next one?

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.261
You want me to watch for
that next transmitter?

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:05.057
Hell, yes, watch out
for that transmitter.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:10.562
We were so happy my heart was in a...

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:14.566
WTMT, the voice
of country in Hazard, Kentucky.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:17.152
We've been seeing all
different parts of the country

01:09:17.237 --> 01:09:19.154
and meeting all kinds of people

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:21.198
and Doolittle, he's driving...

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.158
WMIT in Middlesboro...

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.743
Mama's back in Kentucky
taking care of the four babies.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.830
Bet they're wondering what's
happened to their mama.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:30.332
Top Ridge, Tennessee...

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.125
I had no idea where
singers got songs to sing,

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:34.502
so I thought, "Shoot.
I better just lock myself up in it,

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:37.589
"at least till I get this
music business figured out."

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:44.846
Come fast through the mail

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:48.600
with a satisfied mind...

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:52.854
Doo, can we send the kids
some suckers or something?

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.315
No, baby, we can't afford it.
We ain't got the money.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.526
Here's your baloney, 48 cents.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.862
I'm getting so sick of baloney.

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:02.948
You are? Well, you know what they
say about baloney now, don't you?

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.032
What?

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.410
Makes you horny.

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.328
What's that mean?

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:10.539
Are you so
dad-burned ignorant,

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.291
you don't know
what horny means?

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:13.917
No. What does it mean?

01:10:14.002 --> 01:10:15.460
Ain't gonna tell you.

01:10:15.837 --> 01:10:17.421
Doo!

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.257
Doo, what does it mean?

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:26.179
With all these months on
the road have you hit Nashville yet?

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:27.973
No, sir,
but I'm dying to.

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:31.268
I'm gonna get on the Grand Ole
Opry, too, just as soon as I can.

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:33.395
Well, you know,
sometimes you gotta pay

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.564
a lot of dues to
get on the Opry.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.149
Pay dues?

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:40.193
Well, for most people it takes
years and years of hard work.

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:42.905
Still,
from the looks of things,

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:44.948
you're off to
a real good start.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:46.867
Shoot.
We've been driving so much

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:48.827
I don't even know
where I am half the time.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:52.748
Oh, it's fun, though, you
know, we sing and talk

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.958
and Doo, that's my husband,

01:10:55.043 --> 01:10:56.710
he'll get to acting horny.
What?

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.629
The more I laugh
the hornier he gets.

01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:00.464
Loretta, goddamn!

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.174
He'll say,
"Loretta, spread me up

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.759
"one of them
baloney sandwiches!"

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:07.262
I don't know where in the
hell you think you are, lady,

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:10.223
but that kind of smut don't go
on in this part of the country.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:11.850
I didn't know it was dirty.

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:14.436
I thought horny meant cutting
up and acting silly.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.688
Come off that
dumb hillbilly act.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:17.898
You know, mister,
if you knew Loretta,

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:18.982
you'd know that ain't no act.

01:11:19.067 --> 01:11:20.067
Thank you, Doo.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:21.526
Yeah, well, let me
tell you something.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:24.696
We're gonna be damn lucky not to
lose our FCC license for this.

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.698
And I mean damn lucky!

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:29.785
You know, I'm gonna tell
you something else,

01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:33.455
I ain't never playing another record
of yours on this radio station! Never!

01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:34.873
Goddamn, Loretta.
Don't you ever stop to think

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:36.166
what the hell you're saying?

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:37.834
You told me not to!

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:39.461
Wait up!

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.046
Don't worry about him, kids.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.298
If you're on the charts,
you're gonna get played.

01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:44.800
What charts?

01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:48.178
You got a hit record.
You don't know that?

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:51.682
That really
isn't an act, is it?

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:54.601
Look here, Cash Box magazine,
came out today.

01:11:55.103 --> 01:11:57.396
You're number 14 nationwide.

01:11:58.064 --> 01:12:00.565
You really didn't know.

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:06.989
Thank you. Doo!

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:14.913
I love you, Doo.

01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:17.290
For the girl
with roses on her pillow,

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:21.169
here's Patsy Cline's
number one hit, Crazy.

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:23.046
Crazy

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:29.928
I'm crazy for feeling so lonely

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:37.144
I'm crazy

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:43.775
Crazy for feeling so blue

01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:50.115
I knew

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:54.286
You'd love me as long...

01:12:57.999 --> 01:13:00.042
Doolittle?

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:06.548
Doo? Doo?

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:31.823
That old building sure would
hold a lot of hay, wouldn't it?

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:34.034
This is the
Grand Ole Opry.

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:35.368
You want chocolate or glazed?

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:37.954
The Grand Ole Opry!

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:39.748
What if they won't let me in?

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:43.376
They'd better let us in, I done spent
all the money on these donuts.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.004
Besides that, how are
they gonna keep us out?

01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:51.510
We're number 14!
Nationwide.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:14:00.185
I'm walkin'
the floor over you

01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:05.690
I can't sleep a wink,
that is true

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:10.779
I'm hoping and I'm praying as
my heart breaks right in two

01:14:11.239 --> 01:14:14.991
Walkin' the floor over you

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:19.538
You left me and you went away

01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:23.875
You said that
you'd be back in just a day

01:14:25.545 --> 01:14:28.130
Are you Loretta Lynn?
Loretta Lynn?

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:32.384
Loretta Lynn?
Loretta Lynn? Loretta Lynn?

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:36.596
You Loretta Lynn?
I've been calling and calling you.

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:39.307
Now, Mr. Devine says to
put you on Ernest's show.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.811
Now, you go stand right over yonder
and keep your eyes on Ernest.

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:46.731
He'll introduce you if the
show ain't running too long.

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:52.946
What's the matter with you?

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.031
I'm scared, Doo.
Scared? Goddamn!

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:56.741
I don't belong here.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.326
You belong here as
much as anybody does.

01:14:58.411 --> 01:14:59.911
Now try to quit that
complaining and relax.

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:03.248
I ain't ready.
I ain't paid my dues to be here.

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:05.333
By God, we'll pay
'em later on then.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:11.756
Where you going?

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:14.426
If there's one thing I can't stand,
Loretta, it's a nervous damn woman.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.969
Don't leave.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:17.179
I ain't leaving you,

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:19.848
I'm just going to get out there
and get me some fresh air!

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:28.064
I'm walkin' the floor over you

01:15:28.608 --> 01:15:32.736
I can't sleep a wink,
that is true

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:42.454
Ain't got no place
in here for drunks.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.789
We don't want
no trouble. Go home.

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:48.084
Thank you all.

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:49.920
Thank you so very
much and welcome

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:53.048
to this portion of
our Grand Ole Opry.

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:55.842
Right now I want you
to meet a little gal

01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:58.094
that I feel sure you're
going to love very much.

01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:00.805
So, let's give a great
big Grand Ole Opry welcome

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:03.391
to Miss Loretta Lynn!

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:14.152
Get out there.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.655
Well, if you ain't a picker,
what are you?

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.448
Got a wife singing on the Opry.

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:21.451
Oh, I see.
You're one of the husbands.

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:24.955
Well, I'm one of
the wives, darling.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.289
See you later.

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:28.792
Hey, hey. How about one fifth
wheel buying another one a drink?

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:30.919
Oh, there she is. She's on
right now, she's on the radio!

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:34.214
Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy,
could you turn the radio up?

01:16:34.382 --> 01:16:36.841
...nothing but wrong

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:42.430
Many nights I've
laid awake and cried

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:47.519
We were so happy

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:50.897
My heart was in a whirl

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:56.569
But now I'm a honky tonk girl

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.449
Hey, sweet thing!

01:17:02.076 --> 01:17:03.868
Sweet thing!

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.914
How's that big ol'
ugly husband of yours?

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.333
He's out in the alley trying to
sober up enough to do his show.

01:17:10.418 --> 01:17:12.377
Hey, Del, turn
the radio up, will you?

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:15.839
Listen, I'm trying to hear the radio,
you all. Delmar, turn that thing up!

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:18.049
He's got a wife on the Opry.
That's right.

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:22.304
Oh, is that right?
Hell, you got it made, man!

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:25.765
All you gotta do is lay up and count
it as the old lady rakes it in.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:27.934
Oh, I do my share of the work,
mister. Delmar, turn it up!

01:17:28.019 --> 01:17:29.894
Sure you do, Hoss, sure you do.

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:31.313
Hey, listen,
I told you all politely,

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.023
I'm trying to hear my
wife sing on the radio.

01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:36.568
Oh, is that your job?
I mean, she sings and you listen?

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:37.777
Yeah.

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:46.328
And now I'm a honky tonk girl

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:54.544
I'll be!

01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:57.380
Wonderful.

01:17:57.465 --> 01:18:00.133
Real wonderful, honey,
thank you so much.

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:03.803
Hey, by the way, you think you
might come back next week?

01:18:05.056 --> 01:18:06.639
I ain't got
nothing else planned.

01:18:06.724 --> 01:18:09.517
She ain't got...
Okay, Loretta Lynn!

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:15.940
She's a doll, I'll tell you.
Thank you, honey.

01:18:17.068 --> 01:18:18.360
Doo, did you hear?
They loved me!

01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:19.694
Yeah, I heard ya.

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:22.781
And they want me to come back
next week, can you believe it?

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:24.699
I can believe it, baby.
Now what we gotta do next

01:18:24.784 --> 01:18:26.409
is to sit down
and plan real careful

01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:28.036
what we're gonna do next.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.413
I'm too happy to even
think about that now.

01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:32.457
I don't care if I
die tomorrow, Doo,

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:36.961
if I never sing another song, it ain't
never gonna be any better than this.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:39.464
Did you hurt yourself?
Your jaw's swelling up.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:42.509
That's just from grinning, baby,
that's from pure happiness.

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:50.308
I fall to pieces

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:56.648
How can I be just your friend?

01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:05.448
You want me to act
like we've never kissed

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:10.161
You want me to forget

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:13.957
Pretend we've never met

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:19.546
And I've tried and I've tried

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:22.799
But I haven't yet

01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:29.514
You walk by and
I fall to pieces

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:34.018
Friends, this is a number one
hit song by Miss Patsy Cline.

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:36.146
I guess y'all all know
she's over in the hospital

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.523
'cause she's been in
a real bad car wreck.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.525
So I wanna
dedicate this song to her.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:43.945
So, Patsy, if you're listening,
this song is for you.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:55.206
I fall to pieces

01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:04.174
Oh, thank you.

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:07.135
Loretta, Patsy Cline's husband.

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:09.137
Charlie Dick.
Hello.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:12.098
Patsy heard you tonight and she
wants you to come and see her.

01:20:12.183 --> 01:20:13.558
Can you come?

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.894
Doo, this is Charlie Dick,
Patsy Cline's husband.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:18.146
She heard me.
She was listening in the hospital.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.315
She wants to meet me.
Can we go?

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:23.943
Sure, baby, go ahead. I'll take the
young'uns. Get your mama's guitar.

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:25.195
Are you sure?

01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:26.613
Get in the car, baby.
Yeah.

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:29.991
Okay, honey, Mama will be
home soon. Bye-bye.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:31.159
Bye, Mom.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:34.537
Patsy Cline was listening?
To me?

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:36.831
Bye-bye, honey.

01:20:36.916 --> 01:20:38.541
Bye!
See you later, Mama!

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.341
Hey.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:50.637
Hey! Did you bring me
that beer like I...

01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:56.267
I keep my straw in the top
drawer, honey, right behind you.

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:59.354
Right behind, top drawer.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.901
It's right in there.
Thank you.

01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:09.113
That's the one.
Thank you.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:18.540
What's the matter
with you?

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:22.585
Ain't you ever seen
no glamorous star before?

01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:25.380
You ain't mad at me for singing
your song, are you, Patsy?

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:27.048
Mad?

01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:29.133
Sit down.

01:21:32.972 --> 01:21:35.014
I'm scared

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:37.559
because people might think you
sing that thing better than I do.

01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:38.685
Uh-uh.

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:41.688
You're stirring
things up in this town.

01:21:42.273 --> 01:21:45.358
Hey. How many times
you been on the Opry now?

01:21:45.442 --> 01:21:47.527
I've been on 17 straight times.

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:51.406
People wanna know
who you been sleeping with

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.408
that you been on so many times.

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:55.201
Who's been saying that?

01:21:55.286 --> 01:21:58.454
Gals that have been sleeping with
everybody and still ain't been on yet.

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:00.707
Like who?

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:02.208
Oh.
Let me put it this way,

01:22:02.835 --> 01:22:05.137
take it as a compliment, you
got 'em running scared.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:10.091
I just can't believe I'm sitting
here, talking to Patsy Cline.

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:11.759
You know,
Patsy Cline has been

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:13.761
hospitalized for
several months now

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:15.430
due to a serious accident.

01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:18.349
We are happy to say she is
here tonight to sing for you.

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:21.561
A Grand Ole Opry welcome
for Patsy Cline!

01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:26.524
You're looking
hotter tonight, girl.

01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:42.624
Sweet dreams of you

01:22:47.421 --> 01:22:51.007
Every night

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:57.555
I go through

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:04.896
Why can't I forget you

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:09.984
And start my life anew?

01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:16.199
Instead of having sweet dreams

01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:20.995
About you

01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:28.086
You don't love me

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:31.923
It's plain...

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.801
Johnny
didn't need any dogs...

01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:36.219
Great, Patsy!

01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:37.595
Nice show, Patsy!

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:41.307
What y'all two devils been up to
besides getting into trouble?

01:23:41.392 --> 01:23:43.101
Don't answer that.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:44.852
Delmar, two Co-Colas.

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:47.980
Hey, Patsy, Mooney says he's
gonna take me squirrel hunting.

01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:50.191
Oh, now, Charlie Dick, don't
you bring home no squirrels.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:52.026
When I left Virginia I swore

01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:54.779
I'd never eat another
squirrel as long as I live.

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:59.158
I love squirrel meat.
Don't you like squirrel, Patsy?

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.661
Of course I do.
I married Charlie, didn't I?

01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:05.748
Charlie, you know I love you.

01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:09.335
Even if I have to remind
him every now and then

01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:11.629
he ain't nothin' but
a damn tax deduction.

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:16.884
That goes for you, too, Doolittle
Lynn, and don't you forget it.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:37.780
Right from the
start, most every heart

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:40.533
That's ever been broken...

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:45.037
Doo? You all right?

01:24:45.122 --> 01:24:46.330
Yeah.

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:49.834
Got you enough books?

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:03.639
Get down from there.
Let me try.

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:09.645
My Lord, Patsy, I hope
we don't get rained out.

01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:12.774
You don't get rained
out on circuits like these,

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:14.776
you just keep on singing.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.195
Mud, flood, hell or high water.

01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:19.697
Five minutes, Patsy.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:21.449
Looks like that's it for me.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:23.367
What else do you wear?

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:27.038
I start out with some liquid makeup
and then I powder that down.

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:28.623
Now, look, Loretta,
you get ready

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:30.625
'cause I'm gonna call you
up after my first song.

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:32.043
Okay.

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:36.380
Somebody moving!

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:40.134
What did you do that for?

01:25:40.219 --> 01:25:43.054
What have you got on your face?

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:45.389
I just thought I'd try it.

01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:48.351
Do you like it?
No.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:51.938
Hell, no. You know
that I don't like it.

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:54.732
Now get on back there
and take it off.

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:58.486
No.
What?

01:25:58.612 --> 01:26:00.321
Hey, now,
wait a minute, by God...

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:02.031
Loretta Lynn!

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:03.950
I'll be darned!

01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:12.458
I'm back in baby's arms

01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:17.088
How I missed those lovin' arms

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:21.634
I'm back where I belong

01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:25.888
Back in baby's arms

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:30.268
Don't know why we quarreled

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:31.686
I'm sorry.

01:26:32.104 --> 01:26:35.606
We never did before

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:40.736
Since we found
how much it hurts

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:44.490
I bet we never quarrel anymore

01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:46.993
No good.

01:26:47.077 --> 01:26:48.870
What do you have to do to win
one of these parrots here?

01:26:48.954 --> 01:26:50.705
Two out of three.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:54.500
One...

01:26:54.585 --> 01:26:57.920
One parrot. Let me know
when I run out of money now.

01:26:58.005 --> 01:27:01.048
Get away with every parrot you got.
Uh-huh.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:09.223
Put them right there under the
guitar against the red trailer.

01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:12.560
Come on, let's move it up.
I'm cold, I'm miserable, I'm wet,

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:14.145
I'm gonna lose my voice.

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.064
Have you seen Doo?

01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:18.190
No, darling.

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:20.860
The corner and
put that big ol' thing

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:22.111
up against the dashboard.

01:27:22.195 --> 01:27:23.654
Take this, will ya?

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:25.740
Anything else
in this here?

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:26.824
Yeah,
I got this right here.

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.954
Put them on top.
That's it.

01:27:32.039 --> 01:27:34.373
Let's go.
This bus is taking off!

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:37.209
Woman, if you
wanna keep that arm,

01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:38.628
you better get it
off my husband.

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:40.129
Who are you telling what?

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:42.798
I don't know who you are.
But I know what you are.

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:44.759
Come on, Doo, if you can walk,
they're gonna leave us.

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:46.260
Well, let me
tell you something,

01:27:46.345 --> 01:27:48.012
if you was keeping
your man satisfied,

01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:50.348
he wouldn't have to go nowhere else.

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:52.433
Doo, come on, they're
gonna leave without us.

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:53.851
Loretta, let's go!

01:27:53.936 --> 01:27:55.645
Let me get my parrots, baby.

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:04.028
Loretta!

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.696
Thank you.

01:28:10.202 --> 01:28:11.786
The hell you getting in such
an uproar about, Loretta?

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:12.954
I wasn't doing nothing.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:14.330
Yeah, I saw you doing nothing.

01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:17.375
Loretta, darlin', I get lonesome
standing around by myself,

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:18.793
I need somebody to talk to.

01:28:18.877 --> 01:28:22.880
It didn't look like no talking to me.
I'm warning you, Doo,

01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:25.967
I'd better not ever catch you
with trash like that again.

01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:27.718
I mean it.

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:30.721
Warning me?

01:28:30.973 --> 01:28:34.016
Goddamn, woman, don't you
ever warn me about nothing!

01:28:34.101 --> 01:28:36.185
You understand that?

01:28:37.396 --> 01:28:39.397
Hear me talking to you?

01:28:42.734 --> 01:28:44.735
You hear me talking to you?

01:28:52.202 --> 01:28:55.079
Women like you,
they're a dime a dozen

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:58.165
You can buy 'em anywhere

01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:01.669
For you to get to him
I'll have to move over

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:04.380
And I'm gonna stand right here

01:29:04.464 --> 01:29:05.589
This is the chorus.

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:08.801
It'll be over my dead body

01:29:08.885 --> 01:29:12.096
So get out while you can

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:17.268
'Cause you ain't woman enough
to take my man

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:21.397
Where the hell did you
get the idea for that?

01:29:21.481 --> 01:29:22.857
Where do you think?

01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:31.866
Hey, Charlie!

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.242
Charlie!

01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:37.621
Wake up, Charlie.

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:41.167
Where the hell you been?

01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:43.502
Shopping.
Looks like you have, too.

01:29:43.628 --> 01:29:45.463
Get all that crap
off your face, by God,

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:46.630
I had about
enough of this crap.

01:29:46.757 --> 01:29:48.799
I like it and it's stayin'.
Where the hell you going?

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:50.176
Hold on a minute, Mooney,
this is my idea.

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:51.469
You don't talk to me like that.

01:29:51.553 --> 01:29:53.387
If I wanna wear makeup, I will.

01:29:53.472 --> 01:29:55.890
The hell you will. You're gonna do
exactly whatever the hell I tell you.

01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:57.266
I'll do just what I want!

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:59.018
Don't you talk to me like that.
Don't you hit me!

01:29:59.186 --> 01:30:02.772
Don't you hit me.
I'll whip your butt, girl! Goddamn!

01:30:03.148 --> 01:30:05.399
Hey, hey. Come on,
let's get in the car.

01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.695
Charlie, get in the car and drive.
Loretta, get in the car.

01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:12.990
Charlie,
get in that car and drive.

01:30:13.075 --> 01:30:14.575
Oh, that's Patsy Cline.

01:30:14.659 --> 01:30:16.368
That's Loretta Lynn!

01:30:16.495 --> 01:30:17.995
- Damn!
- Hello, Patsy!

01:30:18.205 --> 01:30:19.789
Get
your camera, honey.

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:21.999
Get ready now.

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:27.671
Ain't no chance of gettin' in
that goddamned car, hey, boys?

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.696
Oh, my God. Did I do that?

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.701
Is it broke?

01:31:05.585 --> 01:31:07.294
Aren't you gonna talk?

01:31:21.726 --> 01:31:24.019
Baby, what I think I'm gonna
do is get me a job somewhere,

01:31:24.104 --> 01:31:26.188
driving a truck
or being a mechanic

01:31:26.273 --> 01:31:28.274
or doing something
that I'm good at.

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:32.778
You're good at managing me.

01:31:32.863 --> 01:31:34.989
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:39.201
Getting here's one thing
and being here's another.

01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:43.664
My job's done, baby,
I'll just get me another one.

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:47.710
Doo, if it's gonna
break us up, I'll quit.

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:50.296
Successful people
don't quit, baby.

01:31:55.719 --> 01:31:58.512
Got another one of your
headaches, don't you?

01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:03.809
Just like your daddy.

01:32:03.894 --> 01:32:06.604
Coal dust give
him the headache.

01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:09.440
I guess I'm what's
giving 'em to you.

01:32:18.617 --> 01:32:19.950
Loretta.

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:27.791
Figured it was about time.

01:32:46.478 --> 01:32:47.603
Doo.

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:56.737
For you
to get to him I'll have to move over

01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:59.490
And I'm gonna stand right here

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:02.451
It'll be over my dead body

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:05.955
So get out while you can

01:33:06.164 --> 01:33:11.502
'Cause you ain't woman enough
to take my man

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:17.591
I'm pregnant again, Patsy.

01:33:17.676 --> 01:33:19.760
Are you sure?

01:33:26.893 --> 01:33:28.227
I don't wanna have it.

01:33:29.688 --> 01:33:32.189
I've been having
babies since I was 14.

01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:34.733
What does Mooney think?

01:33:34.818 --> 01:33:36.402
He doesn't know.

01:33:37.279 --> 01:33:38.779
Hey, come on, I think you
oughta be happy about this.

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:40.114
I'm tickled.

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:42.283
We're gonna have a baby!

01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:44.159
You know what I'm gonna do?

01:33:44.244 --> 01:33:47.496
I'm gonna give you the biggest
baby shower in Nashville.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:49.707
Now, I want you to make a list.

01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:52.376
Then we'll go shopping.

01:33:52.502 --> 01:33:54.837
Hey, you know, I saved all
of my maternity clothes.

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:57.631
In fact, I got
Randy's old things, too.

01:33:57.716 --> 01:34:00.092
You're gonna need
all of this, Loretta.

01:34:03.763 --> 01:34:05.097
You know, I forgot I had this.

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:06.390
Oh, Patsy.

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:07.683
Can you believe it?

01:34:07.767 --> 01:34:09.810
You scared me.

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:11.687
Red's the color
that drives men wild.

01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:13.480
Oh, great,
that's just what I need.

01:34:13.565 --> 01:34:16.900
Well, you never know
when it'll come in handy.

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:21.822
Hey, listen, anything
you can't find in this box

01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:22.906
we're gonna buy
when I get back.

01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:24.408
Where are you going?

01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:26.535
I got a benefit in Kansas City.

01:34:26.619 --> 01:34:28.037
Oh, I didn't know
I threw that thing away.

01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:29.496
Maybe I oughta keep that.
Keep it burnin'.

01:34:29.581 --> 01:34:31.915
Now look, this'll take
you through your fifth month.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.335
Oh, Patsy, are you
sure you want me to have this?

01:34:34.419 --> 01:34:36.128
Oh, yes, darlin', take it.
Take it.

01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:39.214
I got something with your name
written on it right here.

01:34:39.299 --> 01:34:41.508
I love that.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:46.972
Oh, Patsy, I got to go.
Doo's waiting for me.

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:49.141
You all right?
Yeah.

01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:52.019
All right, now,
I'll call you on Monday.

01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:54.021
Okay.
We'll go shopping.

01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:57.149
Anything we can't buy
we'll make.

01:34:57.776 --> 01:34:59.777
Anything we can't make,
we'll steal.

01:35:01.112 --> 01:35:02.279
Now, you take care of
yourself, all right?

01:35:02.364 --> 01:35:03.489
Okay.

01:35:03.573 --> 01:35:04.865
Okay, darling.
Bye-bye, darling.

01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:06.158
Thank you, Patsy.

01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:09.745
Take care. Now, I'm calling you
first thing Monday, don't forget.

01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:15.501
You don't love me

01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:19.463
It's plain

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:23.884
I should know

01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:26.011
I'll never wear...

01:35:26.096 --> 01:35:30.015
You're listening to a special
memorial tribute to the late Patsy Cline,

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:31.725
tragically killed
early this morning

01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:34.937
in a plane crash near
Dyersburg, Tennessee.

01:35:48.201 --> 01:35:49.868
Baby.

01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:52.329
Darlin'.

01:35:53.081 --> 01:35:54.331
She can't be dead.

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:56.375
Baby.

01:35:56.459 --> 01:35:58.502
We was going shopping.

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:01.338
Who am I gonna talk to now?

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.681
I got the names for 'em, Doo.

01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:13.100
Peggy and Patsy.

01:36:13.184 --> 01:36:14.518
Which one is which?

01:36:14.894 --> 01:36:16.603
I don't know.

01:36:16.688 --> 01:36:20.399
I reckon we'll have to wait and
see who grows up to be who.

01:36:20.483 --> 01:36:21.775
Well, one thing's for sure,

01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.777
we're gonna have to get us
a bigger house someplace

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.196
soon as you get some rest.

01:36:26.281 --> 01:36:28.699
I'm gonna go back to work
just as soon as I can, Doo.

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:43.672
Ladies and gentlemen,
from world-famous Grand Ole Opry,

01:36:43.756 --> 01:36:46.091
make welcome Miss Loretta Lynn.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.394
Well, I like my lovin'
done country style

01:36:57.479 --> 01:37:00.564
And this little girl
would walk a country mile

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:03.984
To find her a good ol'
slow-talkin' country boy

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:06.487
I said a country boy

01:37:06.863 --> 01:37:10.240
I'm about as
old-fashioned as I can be

01:37:10.408 --> 01:37:13.076
And I hope you're
likin' what you see

01:37:13.953 --> 01:37:16.747
'Cause if you're lookin' at me

01:37:17.749 --> 01:37:19.583
You're lookin' at country

01:37:21.336 --> 01:37:23.629
You don't see no city

01:37:23.713 --> 01:37:24.922
When you look at me

01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:27.799
'Cause the country is all I am

01:37:28.009 --> 01:37:31.929
I love runnin' barefooted
through the old cornfields

01:37:32.096 --> 01:37:35.933
And I love that country ham

01:37:37.602 --> 01:37:39.603
Ladies and gentlemen,
make welcome, please,

01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:43.774
a young lady with 21 number one
records, Miss Loretta Lynn.

01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:47.945
You don't love me

01:37:49.197 --> 01:37:50.989
It's plain

01:37:53.117 --> 01:37:55.994
I should know

01:37:56.454 --> 01:38:00.499
I'll never wear your ring

01:38:04.587 --> 01:38:08.799
I should hate you

01:38:09.592 --> 01:38:13.470
The whole night through

01:38:14.556 --> 01:38:18.892
Instead of
having sweet dreams...

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:21.061
Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:22.771
the number one
country music entertainer,

01:38:22.855 --> 01:38:24.147
Miss Loretta Lynn.

01:38:24.315 --> 01:38:27.150
You've been
making your brags around town

01:38:27.235 --> 01:38:29.653
That you've been
a-lovin' my man

01:38:29.988 --> 01:38:33.240
But the man I love
when he picks up trash

01:38:33.491 --> 01:38:36.827
He puts it in a garbage can

01:38:36.995 --> 01:38:39.663
That's what you look like to me

01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:42.666
And what I see's a pity

01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:45.419
You better move your feet...

01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:47.504
Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:48.839
the first lady
of country music,

01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:50.173
Miss Loretta Lynn.

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:53.176
There ain't no
pipe can settle this fight

01:38:53.303 --> 01:38:57.347
Your squaw is on
the warpath tonight

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:01.852
Well, I found out,
a-big brave chief

01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:04.730
The game you're
a-hunting for ain't beef

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:08.483
Get off-a my huntin' grounds
Get outta my sight

01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:13.030
This a-war dance I'm doin'
means I'm fightin' mad

01:39:13.323 --> 01:39:16.033
You don't need no more
of what you've already had...

01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:19.745
All I could hear was those
dadgum drums beatin' in my ear.

01:39:20.747 --> 01:39:23.165
When you sing, I feel like
you're talking about my life.

01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:24.374
I made this for you.

01:39:24.459 --> 01:39:26.501
Darlin', thank you, I love it.

01:39:26.586 --> 01:39:28.086
You look tired, you okay?

01:39:28.171 --> 01:39:31.340
No, this is it. I feel like I've
been on the road...

01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:33.216
I got it! I got it!

01:39:33.301 --> 01:39:35.052
What did she do to my hair?

01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:37.471
She cut it. Let's get on the bus.

01:40:22.517 --> 01:40:24.559
That sounds like your mama.

01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:28.605
It sure enough is.

01:40:28.690 --> 01:40:29.898
There's your mama,
kids, let's go.

01:40:31.234 --> 01:40:32.526
Come on.

01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:37.781
Hop in that jeep, let's go say
hello to Mama. There she is!

01:40:39.158 --> 01:40:41.159
Get in there, baby.

01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:48.959
Howdy, Jim.

01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:50.168
Hi, Mooney.

01:40:50.628 --> 01:40:51.878
How you doing, baby?

01:40:51.963 --> 01:40:53.338
I'm fine.

01:40:55.466 --> 01:40:57.759
Come here, twin, get out of
there and give me a hug.

01:40:57.844 --> 01:40:59.219
My name ain't Twin!

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:02.431
You all get out of that jeep, get
down here and say hello to your mama.

01:41:03.182 --> 01:41:05.392
When do you think I'll ever
be able to tell y'all apart?

01:41:05.476 --> 01:41:06.768
Probably never.

01:41:06.853 --> 01:41:09.229
Wait a minute. I want you to
mind your manners around here

01:41:09.313 --> 01:41:10.522
or I'm gonna
whip some hind ends.

01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:14.234
Get on over there and help Jim
unload your mama's stuff.

01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:19.322
My Lord, Doo, what happened?

01:41:19.449 --> 01:41:22.826
Oh, Jack Benny done that. Him and
Ernest Ray was having a little race.

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.578
Well, they didn't
get hurt, did they?

01:41:24.662 --> 01:41:26.830
No, they've done gone to
Nashville to get another one.

01:41:27.832 --> 01:41:29.791
Did you do
something to your hair?

01:41:29.876 --> 01:41:31.835
Yeah, this fan cut it for me.

01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:33.795
Huh.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.881
Looks real good.

01:41:39.719 --> 01:41:41.386
Doo?
Huh?

01:41:41.471 --> 01:41:44.973
I'm gonna ask you to do
something for me, honey.

01:41:48.603 --> 01:41:51.897
I've been having
them bad headaches again, Doo.

01:41:51.981 --> 01:41:54.900
The doctor gave you them pills.
You taking them pills?

01:41:57.445 --> 01:42:00.470
I'm taking them, but they
ain't doing no good.

01:42:02.575 --> 01:42:04.951
Nothing does.

01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:06.745
Maybe you ought
to slow down some.

01:42:07.789 --> 01:42:10.332
Yeah, if you slow down,
they forget about you.

01:42:12.335 --> 01:42:16.505
Doo, when I go back out on the
road I want you to go with me.

01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:18.924
I'm getting rung to
death out there, honey.

01:42:19.592 --> 01:42:22.511
I need somebody to take
care of me a little bit.

01:42:23.638 --> 01:42:26.389
Hell, you got people fighting
each other to take care of you.

01:42:29.769 --> 01:42:31.603
I need you, Doo.

01:42:32.688 --> 01:42:35.315
I need somebody
that cares about me.

01:42:36.442 --> 01:42:38.443
I need you.

01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:03.426
I ain't even gonna bother you.

01:43:04.762 --> 01:43:06.763
Don't worry.

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.407
It's 1:00 in the morning,
what the hell do you want?

01:43:26.659 --> 01:43:28.368
No, Loretta ain't here,
lady, she's on the road.

01:43:28.452 --> 01:43:31.121
How the hell did you get
this number, anyway?

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:35.458
Hey, quit that crying, lady.

01:43:38.337 --> 01:43:41.298
Quit it and I'll give
Loretta your message.

01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:44.634
Yeah.

01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:48.138
All right, you liked
her last album a lot.

01:43:50.892 --> 01:43:52.893
She loves you, too.

01:43:54.937 --> 01:43:56.938
She'll pray for you, too.

01:43:58.733 --> 01:44:02.527
Lady, you're gonna
have to quit that crying.

01:44:02.862 --> 01:44:06.239
Get yourself some sleep, gonna
be better in the morning,

01:44:06.324 --> 01:44:07.741
I guarantee it.

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.996
No. No. You didn't
wake me up.

01:44:14.498 --> 01:44:15.665
Uh-uh.

01:44:16.959 --> 01:44:18.793
That's right.

01:44:20.004 --> 01:44:22.547
There's a lot of lonesome
people in the world.

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.011
Good night.

01:44:37.939 --> 01:44:39.898
- Go get 'em, Loretta.
- There she is.

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:41.107
Better step back there.

01:44:41.192 --> 01:44:42.317
Would you sign this, honey?

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.235
Would you sign this, Loretta?
All right.

01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:48.865
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you make welcome

01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:50.450
the first lady
of country music,

01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:52.202
Miss Loretta Lynn.

01:45:04.966 --> 01:45:08.385
Well, I like my
lovin' done country style

01:45:08.511 --> 01:45:11.680
And this little girl
would walk a country mile

01:45:11.764 --> 01:45:14.265
To find her a good
ol' slow-talkin'...

01:45:17.269 --> 01:45:19.104
Hey, Jim!

01:45:37.915 --> 01:45:39.457
What does it look like, boys?

01:45:40.376 --> 01:45:42.836
She's looking good tonight.

01:45:55.099 --> 01:45:57.600
"They say
to have her hair done."

01:46:03.941 --> 01:46:06.901
They say
to have her hair done

01:46:06.986 --> 01:46:09.446
Liz flies all the way to France

01:46:11.866 --> 01:46:13.783
"Jackie's seen
in a discotheque."

01:46:15.536 --> 01:46:17.287
"Jackie is seen
in a discotheque."

01:46:17.455 --> 01:46:23.293
And Jackie's seen in a discotheque
doing a brand-new dance

01:46:25.838 --> 01:46:27.922
"The White House
social season."

01:46:28.299 --> 01:46:32.052
"The White House social season
should be glittering and gay."

01:46:32.803 --> 01:46:34.971
Hold it, guys.
You Ain't Woman Enough.

01:46:39.977 --> 01:46:41.978
You Ain't Woman Enough.

01:46:42.313 --> 01:46:45.065
You come
to tell me somethin'

01:46:45.191 --> 01:46:48.109
You say I ought to know

01:47:03.125 --> 01:47:04.626
Here's the tape
of her new song.

01:47:04.710 --> 01:47:06.503
She has a problem
with the words now.

01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:08.797
Would you see she gets it?

01:47:38.702 --> 01:47:40.578
There she is!

01:47:42.873 --> 01:47:44.707
Will you
please move down?

01:47:45.209 --> 01:47:47.210
Thank you, move on, now,
keep moving, please.

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:49.295
Doo, what time is it?

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:53.777
Doo?

01:48:19.102 --> 01:48:20.394
Doo?

01:48:21.495 --> 01:48:23.872
Is it time for me to go on yet?

01:48:40.264 --> 01:48:41.598
Where have you been?

01:48:42.266 --> 01:48:45.602
I was just coming to get you.
Are you ready?

01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:47.937
You're supposed to
be taking care of me.

01:48:48.022 --> 01:48:49.981
That's what I'm doing.

01:48:51.108 --> 01:48:53.943
It's just not clear and we have
to set up the schedule properly.

01:48:55.446 --> 01:48:57.280
Honey, you're early, you
got another 10 minutes.

01:48:57.364 --> 01:48:59.407
We gotta talk about what you're
gonna do for the Vegas show.

01:48:59.491 --> 01:49:01.367
I wanna talk to Doo.

01:49:01.744 --> 01:49:04.078
I wanna be with
Doo for a minute.

01:49:15.216 --> 01:49:18.468
I can't sing tonight, Doo.
Somebody tell them.

01:49:19.428 --> 01:49:22.972
Baby, you've got 10,000 people
sitting out there waiting on you.

01:49:25.893 --> 01:49:27.602
Please, Doo.

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.646
Baby, they're out
there waiting on you,

01:49:29.730 --> 01:49:30.855
now you don't
wanna let 'em down.

01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:33.149
Don't tell me about
letting them down,

01:49:33.234 --> 01:49:35.401
you don't even
know them people!

01:49:46.872 --> 01:49:49.916
Darlin', I don't know
what to tell you.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.001
I swear I don't.

01:50:02.221 --> 01:50:05.473
Hell, baby, there ain't
nothing I can tell you.

01:50:11.689 --> 01:50:16.192
All I can do is just tell you to get the
hell out there and sing for the folks.

01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:25.702
Okay, get me on stage,
I wanna go out there.

01:50:42.678 --> 01:50:44.637
Hold it, boys.
Hold it.

01:50:47.182 --> 01:50:48.725
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you make welcome

01:50:48.809 --> 01:50:50.435
the first lady
of country music,

01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:52.145
Miss Loretta Lynn.

01:51:20.758 --> 01:51:24.677
I had something I wanted to come
out here and tell y'all tonight.

01:51:26.347 --> 01:51:28.431
But, Doo, he don't
want me to say nothing.

01:51:35.773 --> 01:51:37.690
But I can tell you.

01:51:40.652 --> 01:51:41.903
Friends.

01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:50.411
'Cause you wouldn't be here
if you didn't care about me.

01:51:56.293 --> 01:51:58.294
See...

01:52:14.228 --> 01:52:19.065
Things is moving
too fast in my life.

01:52:22.319 --> 01:52:23.903
Always have.

01:52:25.697 --> 01:52:28.533
I mean, one day I was just

01:52:30.994 --> 01:52:33.204
a little girl, the next
day I was married,

01:52:33.288 --> 01:52:35.998
the next day
I was having babies,

01:52:40.379 --> 01:52:43.214
and next day I was out
here singing for y'all.

01:52:45.092 --> 01:52:46.843
And...

01:52:51.306 --> 01:52:55.017
Patsy was always saying, "Little
girl, you got to run your own life."

01:53:00.607 --> 01:53:03.568
But my life's running me and...

01:53:09.324 --> 01:53:10.450
Uh...

01:53:16.582 --> 01:53:19.834
Where's my...
Where's Doo?

01:53:27.342 --> 01:53:28.801
Doo?

01:53:30.679 --> 01:53:32.722
Come on, let's go to the bus.

01:53:37.644 --> 01:53:39.061
We've got you.

01:53:49.406 --> 01:53:51.199
Come on, baby.

01:53:52.034 --> 01:53:53.201
Baby.

01:54:57.849 --> 01:55:00.184
Whoa, babies.
Whoa, babies.

01:55:01.395 --> 01:55:04.897
Whoa, babies, slow down, now.
Whoa, babies.

01:55:08.485 --> 01:55:09.652
Hey.

01:55:10.153 --> 01:55:11.487
I got something
I wanna show you.

01:55:11.572 --> 01:55:13.155
What?

01:55:19.913 --> 01:55:21.914
Slow down, Doo!

01:55:34.886 --> 01:55:36.053
What do you think?

01:55:36.138 --> 01:55:37.179
About what?

01:55:39.349 --> 01:55:42.101
What are you up to, Doo?

01:55:42.185 --> 01:55:44.770
I'm gonna build us
a house right here.

01:55:48.025 --> 01:55:49.692
That's a hell of a view,
ain't it?

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:53.821
I picked this particular spot on
account of, well, from right in there

01:55:54.698 --> 01:55:57.199
it looks a bit like
Kentucky used to be.

01:55:58.702 --> 01:56:02.455
Thought I'd put the bedroom back over
in here in the front of the house

01:56:03.498 --> 01:56:04.790
so we can wake up every morning

01:56:04.875 --> 01:56:06.083
and look out that
old picture window

01:56:06.209 --> 01:56:08.461
and watch the sun come up.

01:56:10.547 --> 01:56:13.132
Thought back up here would be a
good place for a breakfast nook.

01:56:13.216 --> 01:56:14.175
And then right...

01:56:14.259 --> 01:56:16.677
Dadgummit, Doo.

01:56:16.762 --> 01:56:19.764
You never asked me nothing
about no new house.

01:56:20.223 --> 01:56:22.016
I wanted to surprise you, baby.

01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:24.060
Well, stop surprising me.

01:56:25.145 --> 01:56:27.855
You never ask me about nothing.

01:56:29.733 --> 01:56:32.068
Well, hell, I thought you'd
want a new house, babe.

01:56:33.362 --> 01:56:35.321
For the privacy if not for
nothing else, by God.

01:56:35.405 --> 01:56:39.241
I ain't said I don't
want no new house.

01:56:39.326 --> 01:56:43.329
I just said you ain't asked me
nothing about it. You never do.

01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:48.084
You just say, "Hey, baby, here's
the deal, take it or leave it!"

01:56:48.168 --> 01:56:49.919
Well, it's driving
me crazy, Doo.

01:56:50.003 --> 01:56:52.713
Hell, let's go to the house, let's
call the lawyers and get a divorce.

01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:54.799
I'm tired of this bullshit.

01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:00.137
I don't want no divorce,

01:57:00.222 --> 01:57:02.932
I just want the dadgum bedroom
in the back of the house.

01:57:05.769 --> 01:57:08.604
You put the dadgum bedroom in
the front of the house, Doo,

01:57:08.689 --> 01:57:12.858
and the sun comes in every morning
at 5:00 and shines in my eyes.

01:57:12.943 --> 01:57:14.860
How am I supposed
to get any sleep?

01:57:14.945 --> 01:57:17.530
You're not too ignorant to get out
of the bed and walk over here

01:57:17.614 --> 01:57:19.824
and pull a set of window
blinds down, are you?

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:22.076
No, and I'm not
too ignorant to know

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:24.412
that the dadgum bedroom don't
belong in the front of the house

01:57:24.496 --> 01:57:26.288
where the living
room ought to be.

01:57:28.417 --> 01:57:32.086
Stop growling, Doo, you sound
like an old bear or something.

01:57:35.215 --> 01:57:36.549
All right,
we'll put the bedroom

01:57:36.633 --> 01:57:38.467
in the back of the house,
all right?

01:57:42.097 --> 01:57:43.973
Let's not be too hasty, Doo,

01:57:44.057 --> 01:57:46.225
maybe we oughta leave the bedroom
in the front of the house,

01:57:46.309 --> 01:57:49.478
it's always been there
and it's pretty here.

01:57:49.563 --> 01:57:52.273
It's beautiful, darlin'. We'll put the
bedroom in the back of the house

01:57:52.357 --> 01:57:54.442
and then we'll put one in
front of the house, too.

01:57:54.526 --> 01:57:58.112
Oh, great. Then we'll both
have our own bedroom.

01:57:58.196 --> 01:58:00.781
No, I'm gonna be
living in a tree house,

01:58:00.866 --> 01:58:02.408
I'm gonna build
right up the hill there.

01:58:06.997 --> 01:58:09.749
Ladies and gentlemen,
back with us once again,

01:58:09.833 --> 01:58:13.127
the first lady of country music,
the coal miner's daughter,

01:58:13.211 --> 01:58:15.212
Miss Loretta Lynn.

01:58:17.174 --> 01:58:22.052
Well, I was born
the coal miner's daughter

01:58:24.306 --> 01:58:29.810
In a cabin on a hill
in Butcher Holler

01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:34.648
We were poor but we had love

01:58:34.858 --> 01:58:38.360
That's the one thing
my daddy made sure of

01:58:39.029 --> 01:58:44.283
He shoveled coal
to make a poor man's dollar

01:58:45.786 --> 01:58:50.706
Daddy loved and raised eight
kids on a miner's pay

01:58:53.210 --> 01:58:57.880
Mommy scrubbed our clothes
on a washboard every day

01:59:00.217 --> 01:59:03.803
Why, I've seen
her fingers bleed

01:59:03.887 --> 01:59:07.056
To complain there was no need

01:59:07.516 --> 01:59:12.895
She'd smile in Mommy's
understanding way

01:59:14.856 --> 01:59:20.319
In the summertime
we didn't have shoes to wear

01:59:21.571 --> 01:59:26.909
But in the wintertime
we'd all get a brand-new pair

01:59:29.329 --> 01:59:32.289
From a mail-order catalogue

01:59:32.791 --> 01:59:36.293
Money made from sellin' a hog

01:59:36.419 --> 01:59:42.091
Daddy always managed
to get the money somewhere

01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:48.973
Yeah, I'm proud to be
a coal miner's daughter

01:59:50.934 --> 01:59:56.480
I remember well
the well where I drew water

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:01.277
The work we done was hard

02:00:01.736 --> 02:00:05.030
At night we'd sleep
'cause we were tired

02:00:05.282 --> 02:00:11.078
I never thought of ever
leavin' Butcher Holler

02:00:12.122 --> 02:00:17.626
Well, a lot of things have
changed since way back then

02:00:20.213 --> 02:00:25.175
And it's so good to
be back home again

02:00:26.845 --> 02:00:29.722
Not much left but the floor

02:00:30.557 --> 02:00:33.809
Nothing lives here anymore

02:00:34.311 --> 02:00:39.815
'Cept the memories
of a coal miner's daughter

02:00:45.196 --> 02:00:48.240
They say to have her hair done

02:00:48.325 --> 02:00:51.577
Liz flies all the way to France

02:00:52.454 --> 02:00:58.834
And Jackie's seen in a discotheque
doing a brand-new dance

02:00:59.252 --> 02:01:05.758
And the White House social season
should be glittering and gay

02:01:06.968 --> 02:01:10.554
But here in Topeka
The rain is a-fallin'

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:14.016
The faucet is a-drippin'
and the kids are a-bawlin'

02:01:14.142 --> 02:01:17.603
One of the them's a-toddlin'
and one is a-crawlin'

02:01:17.687 --> 02:01:20.522
And one's on the way

02:01:23.026 --> 02:01:28.989
Ever since you left me
I've done nothing but wrong

02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:35.245
Many nights I've
laid awake and cried

02:01:36.539 --> 02:01:42.419
We were so happy
my heart was in a whirl

02:01:43.338 --> 02:01:48.842
But now I'm a honky tonk girl

02:01:49.219 --> 02:01:52.554
You come to tell me somethin'

02:01:52.681 --> 02:01:55.891
You say I ought to know

02:01:56.184 --> 02:02:02.022
That he don't love me anymore
and I'll have to let him go

02:02:02.482 --> 02:02:08.696
You say you're gonna take him
but I don't think you can

02:02:09.531 --> 02:02:14.952
'Cause you ain't woman enough
to take my man

02:02:15.745 --> 02:02:19.415
Well, I like my lovin'
done country style

02:02:19.499 --> 02:02:22.751
And this little girl
would walk a country mile

02:02:22.877 --> 02:02:26.380
To find her a good ol'
slow-talking country boy

02:02:26.464 --> 02:02:28.590
I said a country boy

02:02:29.050 --> 02:02:32.636
I'm about as
old-fashioned as I can be

02:02:32.762 --> 02:02:35.597
And I hope you're
likin' what you see

02:02:36.307 --> 02:02:38.934
'Cause if you're lookin' at me

02:02:39.978 --> 02:02:43.147
You're lookin' at country

02:02:44.107 --> 02:02:47.276
Well, you've been
makin' your brags around town

02:02:47.402 --> 02:02:50.237
That you've been lovin' my man

02:02:50.321 --> 02:02:53.699
But the man I love
when he picks up trash

02:02:53.783 --> 02:02:56.702
He puts it in a garbage can

02:02:56.828 --> 02:02:59.913
And that's what
you look like to me

02:02:59.998 --> 02:03:02.458
And what I see's a pity

02:03:02.959 --> 02:03:06.253
You better move your feet
if you don't wanna eat

02:03:06.379 --> 02:03:09.173
A meal that's called Fist City

02:03:10.967 --> 02:03:13.719
Well, your pet name
for me is "squaw"

02:03:13.803 --> 02:03:16.805
When you come home drinkin'
and can barely crawl

02:03:16.931 --> 02:03:21.143
And all that lovin' on me
won't make things right

02:03:22.437 --> 02:03:25.147
Well, you leave me at home
to keep the tepee clean

02:03:25.315 --> 02:03:28.150
And six papooses
to break and wean

02:03:28.234 --> 02:03:32.237
Your squaw is on
the warpath tonight

02:03:33.490 --> 02:03:36.492
No, don't come home a-drinkin'

02:03:36.659 --> 02:03:39.369
With lovin' on your mind

02:03:39.496 --> 02:03:44.875
Just stay out there, on the
town and see what you can find

02:03:45.293 --> 02:03:48.087
'Cause if you want
that kind of love

02:03:48.171 --> 02:03:50.798
Well, you don't
need none of mine

02:03:50.924 --> 02:03:56.595
So don't come home a-drinkin'
with lovin' on your mind

02:03:58.139 --> 02:04:04.770
No, don't come home a-drinkin'
with lovin' on your mind

02:04:05.305 --> 02:04:11.349
