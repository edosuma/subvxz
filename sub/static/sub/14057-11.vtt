WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:04.100
???? to promote my book.

00:04.100 --> 00:06.300
Good, because if you think this little trip of yours
is gonna

00:06.300 --> 00:07.900
<i>send me scurrying
back to France...</i>

00:07.900 --> 00:09.200
Taylor told me of your studies,

00:09.200 --> 00:10.800
the series
of articles you wrote.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.300
You lied to make me look good--
I get that--

00:12.300 --> 00:13.900
but I think part of you
wishes it were true.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.100
I think I should go.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.800
Kirsten, I am so sorry.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.600
That you've been running
a prostitution ring through our business?

00:19.600 --> 00:22.300
I like you.
What do you say
I give you a call when I leave here?

00:22.300 --> 00:23.700
I think we should
stay engaged.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.600
I don't think that you can be
with someone

00:26.100 --> 00:27.700
until you can be with yourself.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.100
Oh, that sounds like a...

00:30.100 --> 00:31.500
I guess it's a no.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.800
Dude, I asked the girl
to marry me.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.800
Yeah, and she said no.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.000
It's not like she
broke up with you.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
That would have
been better.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.300
Someone says they don't
want to marry you,

00:45.300 --> 00:46.400
you're supposed
to break up.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.400
Now we got to keep
on dating

00:47.400 --> 00:48.800
like everything
is normal,

00:48.800 --> 00:50.500
when there's this gi-normous...

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
elephant in the room.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.200
Yeah, there's an elephant?
Yeah.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.300
The "I don't want
to marry you" elephant.
All right, look.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.200
There's no elephant,
and there's no breakup.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.300
It's a breakup.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.600
How else do you explain
17 unreturned phone calls?

01:01.600 --> 01:02.700
Seventeen?

01:02.800 --> 01:05.099
The first 12
were apologies for that stupid lie

01:05.099 --> 01:06.700
I told Henri about Ryan.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.200
And after that, it was
just kind of a blur.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.800
Sooner or later, he has
to call me back, right?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.900
I'll call her
when I'm ready.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.300
What?

01:15.400 --> 01:17.700
She lied to me about
her French ex-husband.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.500
And she also apologized.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.800
Taylor doesn't respond
well to neglect, man.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.100
You should call her.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.600
Yeah? Maybe you
should call Summer.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.500
Is that Seth?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
Che.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.700
I'll call him back.

01:34.100 --> 01:34.800
He's flying here.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.400
He was feeling
weird Seth vibes.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.900
All the way from Rhode Island?

01:37.900 --> 01:39.500
Che transcends space and time.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.300
Ryan?

01:43.800 --> 01:45.200
No, Henri-Michel.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.500
God, Frenchie's really putting
on the full-court press, huh?

01:47.500 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.100
Nothing's happened yet, though.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.100
I keep telling him
I've got a boyfriend.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.800
Even though, technically,
I guess I don't anymore.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.100
You know, I think Ryan's
just waiting for Henri

01:56.100 --> 01:57.300
to go back to the motherland.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.100
She said in her message
he's still in town.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.000
Until he leaves, we can't have
a real conversation.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.600
I don't get it--
when is he leaving?

02:02.600 --> 02:05.200
That's just it;
he's not leaving.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.200
He's renting a
house in Newport,

02:07.200 --> 02:09.500
and he asked me
to move in with him.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.400
What?

02:10.900 --> 02:12.000
You're not considering it,
are you?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.100
It's just that
I've been mooching

02:13.100 --> 02:15.000
off of you and Julie
for months now,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.300
and I've lived
with Henri-Michel before,

02:17.300 --> 02:19.700
and he's really not
a bad roommate, you know,

02:19.700 --> 02:22.500
aside from his natural odor
and-- I don't know--

02:22.500 --> 02:24.700
maybe I can force myself
to fall in love with him.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.500
Why would you want to do that?

02:28.200 --> 02:30.100
Because I'm going to need
some help getting over Ryan.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.600
They're going to call.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.800
Maybe we should call.

02:37.800 --> 02:38.800
TAYLOR:
They're going to call.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.700
Right?

03:22.800 --> 03:23.500
Atwood.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.000
Hey, Roberts.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.600
Hey, look,I'm sorry to bother you
at work,

03:26.600 --> 03:28.100
but I just really needed
to talk to you.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.200
Oh, no macho
nacho supreme?
No.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.300
Are you sure? It's really good.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.200
How's Seth?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.000
See, I kind of turned
down his proposal

03:34.000 --> 03:35.200
and never heard
from him again.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.500
Proposal?

03:36.500 --> 03:38.300
That's the first time
I'm hearing about it.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.600
Right. For a week now,
Seth has been off the map.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.900
You expect me to believe
that not once

03:41.900 --> 03:44.300
did he mention anything
about a proposal going awry?

03:44.900 --> 03:47.200
Right, well, he had pinkeye.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.100
Pinkeye?
Mm-hmm.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.800
Uh-huh. Did you
have pinkeye, too?

03:50.000 --> 03:50.700
What? Why?

03:50.700 --> 03:52.000
Well, 'cause Taylor said
she didn't hear from you,

03:52.000 --> 03:53.800
either,
and she was asking about you.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.300
Well, see, that
was 'cause I was,

03:55.300 --> 03:57.000
I was helping him
with his recovery.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.500
And waiting for
Henri-Michel to leave.

04:00.700 --> 04:04.200
Actually, I don't really mean
to be the bearer of bad news,

04:04.300 --> 04:06.700
but he's looking for a house
to rent in Newport.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.300
(sighs):
Great.

04:12.900 --> 04:13.800
Summer?

04:20.300 --> 04:21.700
Hey, Che, what are you
doing here?

04:22.700 --> 04:23.700
Tai Chi.

04:24.100 --> 04:27.200
The soft and pliable will
destroy the hard and strong.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.500
I guess I meant what are you
doing in Summer's living room?

04:29.500 --> 04:30.700
I'm here for you.

04:32.700 --> 04:33.500
Fig?

04:33.700 --> 04:36.700
Did you know
that figs are nature's biological
response modifiers?

04:37.200 --> 04:39.200
And since I know that you're
ailing spiritually...

04:39.800 --> 04:40.600
What?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.500
Come on, man,
you can't lie to me.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.600
I can see your aura.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.800
Besides, Summer told me
she rejected your proposal.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.200
Oh.

04:48.700 --> 04:49.200
Well...

04:49.200 --> 04:51.300
When she hadn't heard from
you for a couple days,she got pretty worried.

04:51.300 --> 04:54.200
Yeah. No, that was just
my sciatica acting up.

04:54.300 --> 04:57.700
Seth, you put something out into the universe,
and you didn't get it back.

04:57.700 --> 05:00.900
I mean, I really can't
imagine what a blow that must have been
to your male animus.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.600
You've been emasculated.

05:03.100 --> 05:06.000
My masculinity is intact.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.700
Look, you and Summer
revealed my hypocrisy, man.

05:08.700 --> 05:11.200
You saved me,
so I hear that you're hurting,

05:11.600 --> 05:13.000
I just want to come
and try to save you.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.000
Thank you, but,
you know, I'm good.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.700
I'm very good.

05:18.500 --> 05:18.900
Hey.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.500
Summer. Hi.

05:20.900 --> 05:21.900
Your pinkeye is all clear.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.100
Pinkeye?
Yeah.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.900
The reason why
I haven't heard from you.

05:25.000 --> 05:25.800
I talked to Ryan.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.400
It was his sciatica.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.600
Yeah, when it gets in your eye,
it goes, it goes pink.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.300
I'm great.

05:31.300 --> 05:32.400
You are?
Are you?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.400
Yes.
Good.

05:34.900 --> 05:35.800
'Cause I missed you.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.500
Tonight, we are going
to have a date.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.500
Hey, a date sounds

05:40.700 --> 05:42.000
perfect.
A romantic date.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.700
Aren't they all, Summer?
Aren't they all?

05:43.700 --> 05:45.000
High fives all around.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.400
High fives... all around.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.700
Seriously, I'm good.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.100
I'll see you tonight
for this date.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.000
Uh, perhaps I was wrong.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.100
Seth is actually stronger
than we thought.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.700
I wouldn't leave town just yet.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.700
Hmm. There's lots
of closet space.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.900
Plenty of room for your pants.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.600
Each pair could have
its own walk-in.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.100
What is this American
obsession with closets?

06:15.200 --> 06:16.700
It's a capitalist
conspiracy

06:16.700 --> 06:18.400
to hide what you own
so you will buy more?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.100
Or does it have to do with sex?

06:20.800 --> 06:22.500
Henri, are you sure
you really want to move here?

06:22.900 --> 06:26.000
I will do whatever it takes
to win back your love, Peaches.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.800
You see, that is
very brave of you.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.600
You're really
putting yourself out there.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.400
You're really taking
an emotional risk.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.000
Unlike some people.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.100
Still have not heard from Ryan?

06:35.100 --> 06:36.400
No, and you would think

06:36.400 --> 06:38.700
that he would at least have the
decency to dump me on the phone.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.100
But it's fine, though.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.000
I'm fine, because Ryan and I were never really
going to work, anyway.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.300
He doesn't even like cheese.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.800
Oh. I must admit,
I feel for him.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.500
I know the excruciating
pain of living without you.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.300
And a life without
cheese, well...

06:54.300 --> 06:55.100
You know,
it's probably good

06:55.100 --> 06:56.100
that you came back when you did,

06:56.100 --> 06:58.200
before Ryan and I
got any more serious.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.300
I know it is
good for me. Hmm.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.700
<i>Je t'aime, Peaches.</i>

07:03.700 --> 07:04.600
Oh, no, no.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.100
Henri, you don't
have to say that.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.400
But I love to say that,
because it is the truth.

07:09.700 --> 07:12.000
I will say it a thousand
times, if you like.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.500
Wow.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.400
That's, uh-- okay, yeah,
say it a thousand times.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.300
<i>I love you, un.
I love you, deux.</i>

07:18.600 --> 07:19.600
<i>I love you trois.</i>

07:21.700 --> 07:23.900
Look, I got my first
non-cheating A.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.700
Your tutoring is
really paying off.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.100
WILL:
Kind of weird,

07:27.100 --> 07:29.000
since we barely studied
last night.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.300
Yeah, I guess you can learn
chemistry from making out.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.400
I actually did some studying
after you left.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.500
I guess your work ethic
is kind of contagious.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.300
Let's see what
else I can catch.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.800
Um, why is this girl
staring at me?

07:43.900 --> 07:44.700
(mumbling):
I don't know.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.700
Hi, Will.

07:48.700 --> 07:52.000
Hey.
Your solo at
practice this morning was so amazing.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.100
Thanks.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.000
Um, Lucy, this is Kaitlin.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.700
Kaitlin, this is Lucy.
She's in band with me.

07:59.100 --> 07:59.800
No kidding.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.100
You still in for Friday night?

08:01.100 --> 08:02.100
Yeah, sure, I'll be there.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.300
Great, I can't wait.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.000
What's Friday night?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.200
We're having a bake sale in the student lounge,

08:07.400 --> 08:09.100
to raise money for new uniforms.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.800
Will and I are manning
the Rice Krispy treats table.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.400
See you later, Will.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.600
I'm going to go
practice my scales.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.400
All right.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.800
You should come;
it'll be fun.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.400
Band geeks
and baking goods.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.200
Definitely sounds like the
feel-good hit of the year.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.700
Well, maybe we can
do something after.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.600
Well, I do have a Latin test
coming up.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.300
Maybe you can help me study.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.299
All right. Um, well, I guess
I'll see you a little later.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.100
New Match.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.700
Hi, Kiki, don't hang up.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.700
You turn our business
into a prostitution ring,

08:47.700 --> 08:49.700
and you get hung up on--
company policy.

09:00.400 --> 09:00.900
New Match.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.400
Did you at least get
my cookie bouquet?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.300
I'm allergic to chocolate.
No, you're not.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.500
Then I'm allergic to you.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.400
Just tell me how long you're
gonna be mad at me about this.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.700
You're kidding, right?

09:09.200 --> 09:11.800
Kirsten, our friendship can't just end like this.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.200
There must be something
I can do.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.000
If you'll excuse me, I have
a legitimate business to run

09:16.000 --> 09:17.400
that doesn't involve hookers.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.500
Ryan.

09:36.100 --> 09:36.600
Finally.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.500
Is Taylor in?

09:37.500 --> 09:39.900
You know, she's been asking about you
every day this week.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.400
I'm here now.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.200
She's not.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
Try the Four Seasons.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.600
Where her French ex-husband
is staying?

09:48.900 --> 09:50.600
All right, I guess
I can head over there.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.900
So what did you
end up getting her?
Huh?

09:52.800 --> 09:55.100
Don't tell me you
came with no gift.

09:55.100 --> 09:55.800
I don't need a gift.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.900
Ryan, Pep?Le Pew
is buying her a house.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.600
She's moving in with him?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.600
You honestly got her nothing?

10:02.400 --> 10:04.700
I mean, you couldn't have gone
to the Quickie Mart

10:04.700 --> 10:06.300
to get her a stuffed animal

10:06.300 --> 10:07.500
and some gummy bears?

10:08.000 --> 10:08.900
Gummy bears.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.300
Talk is cheap, Ryan.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.000
If you're going toe-to-toe
with this Frenchie,

10:12.600 --> 10:14.000
you're going to need
to step your game up.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.400
I can't believe I'm getting
advice from a 15-year-old.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.800
A 15-year-old who's right.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.300
Okay, so the big date's
in your bedroom?
Uh, yeah.

10:22.300 --> 10:23.300
You saved some
money on gas.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.500
Ryan lent me
some videogames.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
There's Thai takeout

10:33.000 --> 10:35.300
and some of your
favorite whiny records.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.100
SETH:
Mm...

10:36.800 --> 10:37.800
And...

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I still really love you.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.400
But, I hope we get
married someday,

10:43.400 --> 10:44.100
I'm just not ready now.

10:44.100 --> 10:47.200
Hey, forget the whole thing
ever happened. I know I have.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.500
I don't want to forget about it.

10:48.700 --> 10:49.900
What you did was amazing.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.300
It was so sweet.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.500
The words you said

10:52.500 --> 10:55.100
and how sincere you were
when you said them.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.100
Uh...

10:56.500 --> 10:58.800
And the glow-in-the-dark ring,
it was so cute.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.600
Yeah, it's so hot in here.

11:01.800 --> 11:02.700
Yeah, that's
a good thing.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.500
No, I, I think the...

11:04.500 --> 11:05.900
air conditioning is broken

11:05.900 --> 11:07.200
or something,
maybe.
It's winter.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.600
I'm going to go get
a glass of water.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.100
Do you want anything?
No.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.200
No water?
Seth.

11:17.100 --> 11:17.800
Hey, Che.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.300
Seth. Hey.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.500
You look...
Not good, I know.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.700
So, the thing you said about my
animus...

11:24.800 --> 11:26.400
I was right, wasn't I?

11:26.400 --> 11:28.200
See, 'cause the flesh can lie

11:28.300 --> 11:29.700
but the aura
never does.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.300
It's been eating at you,
little buddy, I can tell.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.600
And you can fix me?

11:34.400 --> 11:35.800
That's what I do.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.600
????

11:41.400 --> 11:42.400
Hey, Seth, it's me.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.200
Just calling to see
how you're feeling.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.700
Hope that crazy
24-hour flu thing cleared up.

11:49.700 --> 11:50.500
And, uh...

11:50.500 --> 11:53.100
also I don't believe that
you have the flu. Okay, bye.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.500
<i>CHE'S VOICE:
Dear Caterpillar,</i>

11:58.500 --> 12:01.000
<i>Last night,
Seth came to me for help.</i>

12:01.200 --> 12:02.800
<i>I'm taking him to the forest.</i>

12:02.900 --> 12:05.800
<i>He needs to pick up the sword
and embrace his inner warrior.</i>

12:06.000 --> 12:07.700
<i>Only by running with the wolves</i>

12:07.700 --> 12:09.500
<i>shall he learn
to walk like a man.</i>

12:09.500 --> 12:10.800
Are you sure I don't need
to bring my phone?

12:10.800 --> 12:12.500
It's got GPS.
What if we get lost?

12:12.500 --> 12:13.600
No, you don't
need anything.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.500
What about a jacket?
What if it's cold?

12:15.700 --> 12:19.100
All we need is my
harmonica-- got it--

12:19.300 --> 12:22.500
your broken spirit and
these giant backpacks.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.700
<i>I will help your soul mate
find himself.</i>

12:28.800 --> 12:30.700
<i>But where are you, Summer Bear?</i>

12:30.700 --> 12:34.000
<i>Where is the Iron Butterfly
who once inspired me so?</i>

12:34.600 --> 12:35.800
<i>As we had into the trees,</i>

12:35.800 --> 12:38.800
<i>perhaps you need to find
your own path.</i>

12:39.900 --> 12:42.700
<i>Peace and Love, Che.</i>

12:43.400 --> 12:44.700
Oh, Crap.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.500
Ryan.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.100
Entrée.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.100
So, you are here
to beat me up.

12:56.100 --> 13:00.100
I warn you-- my family is hemophilic; I will bleed.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.500
I'm actually looking for Taylor.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.500
Kaitlin told me she
was hanging out here.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.200
But if she's not around...

13:05.200 --> 13:06.500
I was kidding.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.500
You are welcome.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.800
Can I get you some coffee?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.600
It tastes like urine,

13:10.700 --> 13:13.000
but apparently that is how
you Americans drink it.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.700
You mind me asking when
she's gonna be back?

13:14.700 --> 13:16.900
Ah, she is shopping
for furniture.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.500
We move in to our
new house on Monday.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.100
Monday?

13:23.700 --> 13:24.900
All right, well, look.

13:24.900 --> 13:27.500
If you could just, um,
tell her I stopped by.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.800
Stop.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.200
What is that in your hand?

13:31.200 --> 13:32.900
Uh? Oh...

13:34.100 --> 13:35.100
It's noth... it's stupid.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.100
It's not stupid.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.700
It's a teddy bear.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.400
Oh...

13:39.500 --> 13:41.000
what is in his mug?

13:41.800 --> 13:42.500
Gummy bears.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.100
Ah, how amusing.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.400
It is for Taylor?

13:46.500 --> 13:47.100
Yeah.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.900
Well, I will deliver it to her.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.400
It's a tad juvenile,

13:50.400 --> 13:52.900
but it is from the heart
and that is what matters.

13:52.900 --> 13:53.700
You know what? No, it's fine.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.000
Really, it's from
the Quickie Mart and...
Stop being modest.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.700
I'm not afraid of a little
competition, Ryan.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
It is more fulfilling

14:00.000 --> 14:03.400
if Taylor chooses me in spite
of you wanting her back.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.200
Well, that's comforting.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.900
Now, I feel a poem coming.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.400
All right.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.300
Hello?

14:18.300 --> 14:20.800
Hey, Kirsten, it's Spencer.
Is Julie there?

14:20.800 --> 14:22.200
She doesn't work here
anymore, Spencer.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.500
You should call her at home.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.400
I can't, I'm in Mexico
about to get on a boat.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.200
But we have a problem.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.700
<i>What problem
could we possibly have?</i>

14:30.700 --> 14:34.700
One of my boys, Chaz,
called me last night and, uh,

14:35.500 --> 14:36.700
turns out he has chlamydia.

14:36.700 --> 14:37.300
What?

14:37.300 --> 14:40.100
Yeah, so you're probably
gonna want to call and tell
everyone he slept with.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.300
I most certainly will not.

14:41.300 --> 14:42.200
It's up to you and Julie.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.900
Hey, I'm out of the country.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.100
And, you know, you just told me

14:45.100 --> 14:46.700
that Julie doesn't
work there anymore,

14:46.700 --> 14:48.500
so... good luck.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.300
Julie has the list. Bye.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.600
Isn't that her?
Yeah.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.000
I've been looking for you.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.700
Oh, hi, friend
of Will's.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.200
Nice hat.

15:03.700 --> 15:04.800
Listen, skank.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.400
What'd you just call me?

15:06.500 --> 15:09.800
If you show up at our bake sale
tonight, I'll kick your face in.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.300
I'd definitely like
to see that happen.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.700
I happen to be a brown belt
in Tai Kwon Do.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.900
I happen to be going to second
with the guy that you like.

15:17.800 --> 15:18.200
Go.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.700
Now. Before the Munchkins
ask for their mayor back.

15:20.700 --> 15:23.000
If we see your
face tomorrow,you will regret it.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.800
What, you going to blow your little trumpet at me
until I cry?

15:26.700 --> 15:27.200
You know,

15:27.400 --> 15:29.600
I was thinking about doing
something fun tomorrow night.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.400
But now I think I will go
to your little geek fest

15:32.400 --> 15:33.400
and buy
some brownies.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.800
Bonjour.

15:43.800 --> 15:44.700
I am exhausted.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.900
If I have to look at one
more mid-Century sofa,

15:47.000 --> 15:47.900
I'm going to kill somebody.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.100
Well, you should have a nap.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.700
perhaps we both should.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.200
Yeah, it's just,
you know,

15:54.400 --> 15:56.400
I saw this special
on hotel rooms,

15:56.400 --> 15:58.300
and they search them
with UV lights

15:58.300 --> 16:00.100
and, gah,
you don't want to know.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.400
Oh, you Americans
and your germs.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.200
By the way,
Ryan...

16:06.900 --> 16:08.600
brought this for you today.

16:09.400 --> 16:13.400
He is not a classic romantic
to be sure, but, uh,

16:13.400 --> 16:15.600
the bear has
a sweet smile, hmm?

16:16.300 --> 16:17.900
???

16:18.600 --> 16:19.600
??

16:19.800 --> 16:21.000
????

16:21.000 --> 16:22.400
???

16:24.100 --> 16:28.100
????

16:29.500 --> 16:30.600
??

16:30.600 --> 16:33.400
??? for my poetry reading
tomorrow.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.600
Kiki, you're calling me.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.700
I'm delivering a message.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.100
Spencer called.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.300
It seems that one of your
whores, Chaz, has chlamydia.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.400
Chlamydia, ooh, that's rough.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.800
Well, all the women
that this guy slept with is going to have to be informed.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.400
Spencer says you have a list.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.600
Yes, of course.
I'll drop it off tomorrow.

16:57.700 --> 16:58.600
Drop it off?

16:59.300 --> 17:00.900
Julie, I am not doing this.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.000
You're going
to have to tell them.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.400
Well, Kirsten, I'd love to,

17:03.400 --> 17:06.000
but I kind of don't work
at New Match anymore.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.200
Oh, no, no, no.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.300
You are not making this
my responsibility.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.800
How about a compromise?

17:11.599 --> 17:12.300
I'm listening.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.400
We do it together.

17:14.900 --> 17:15.900
I'm not facing those women.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.300
I'll do the talking, you drive.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.500
And how come you can't drive?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.400
Oh, I'm sorry, do you want
to do the talking?

17:20.900 --> 17:22.300
It was our company.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.500
You're liable.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.700
I'll pick you up in the morning.

17:26.099 --> 17:27.599
I'll find my little black book.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.000
Come on, Taylor,
I need you to come over.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.100
Because I am making dinner.

17:34.700 --> 17:35.600
A gourmet dinner.

17:35.900 --> 17:36.600
Mm-hmm.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.200
And I know you, more than
anyone, appreciate fine food.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.000
What am I making?

17:42.100 --> 17:45.700
I am making quail
and some caviar.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.300
Maybe even a souffl?

17:48.900 --> 17:50.400
That is not over my head, okay?

17:50.500 --> 17:53.000
For your information,
I recently made a brisket and it was delightful.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.600
Okay, great,
I will see you soon.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.400
Bye.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.600
So she's coming.

18:02.700 --> 18:03.400
Now you're going
to tell me why

18:03.400 --> 18:04.500
I just had to lie
to my friend?

18:04.700 --> 18:06.000
Uh, because I need to see her.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.000
Because?

18:07.100 --> 18:08.600
I need to tell her how I feel.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.300
Mm-hmm.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.200
What?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.000
Nothing.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.400
You just don't really strike me
as the coffee cart type.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.700
And what does that mean?

18:16.700 --> 18:18.600
Look, I'm sure
you have changed--

18:18.700 --> 18:20.800
being with Taylor
made you more expressive--

18:21.300 --> 18:22.500
but articulating your feelings

18:22.500 --> 18:24.300
to your girlfriend,
kind of a challenge.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.200
Yeah, but if I don't make
some sort of declaration...

18:27.200 --> 18:28.300
You might lose her.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.800
Okay, you just need
to take a deep breath,

18:32.400 --> 18:34.700
look inside and say
what's from your heart.

18:35.300 --> 18:36.800
I can do that.
Good.

18:37.100 --> 18:38.200
One more thing.
Yeah?

18:39.200 --> 18:41.800
Taylor has a super big heart,
and she's super forgiving,

18:42.100 --> 18:44.600
but, uh, there is a French guy circling like
a great white shark.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.000
Okay, you're just reminding me
of the stakes.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
No. I'm giving you advice
because you're my friend and I really want you
to work this out.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.400
All right, I'm listening,
I'm listening.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.000
Do not choke.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.700
Okay, I wasn't going to
until you did that.

18:55.900 --> 18:56.800
You kind of have a wide neck.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.100
Yeah, you got really small
hands. Thanks for the advice.

18:59.100 --> 18:59.800
No problem.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.400
SETH:
Are we almost there yet?

19:02.800 --> 19:04.600
CHE:
Why is everything a destination?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.800
Do the fish care
where they swim each day?

19:06.800 --> 19:09.000
Uh, actually,
I think they do.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.800
You still haven't told me
what we're doing here.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.300
Seth, relax.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.000
Smell the trees.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.800
Let the oxygen clean your blood.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.300
Boy, I sure
feel better.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.200
Can we go back now?

19:20.400 --> 19:21.300
We've been hiking for hours.

19:21.300 --> 19:24.900
I'm exhausted and I'm starving
and my ass is cramping up.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.300
Let's get to the top
of the hill.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.000
We're going to sing
a song to the sunset...

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
And then
we can go home?

19:29.100 --> 19:31.300
No. I think it's
time I told you.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.400
Your spirit animal
is trapped.
What?

19:34.600 --> 19:35.600
See, when a baby is born,

19:35.600 --> 19:37.600
an animal spirit enters
the child in order

19:37.700 --> 19:39.100
to guide and protect
him on his journey.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.300
Somehow Summer's rejection

19:40.300 --> 19:42.600
caused your spirit animal
to get sick.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.800
In order to contact
your animal,

19:45.800 --> 19:47.500
you must learn
to live like him.

19:48.500 --> 19:52.200
To spend the night
in the forest.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.000
Ah, we're here, Seth.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.500
We've reached
the sacred spot.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.600
Now, we got to build
a sweat lodge.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.000
Che, look at me.
We're not staying here.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.500
Where's the car?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.100
The car is six hours away.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.000
I mean, if we could
even find it in the dark.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.300
We have no choice but
to stay here until tomorrow.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.300
Go grab some willow branches.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.000
I brought hides--

20:19.200 --> 20:20.600
buffalo, elk.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.700
Willow branches-- you know
what willow looks like?

20:24.500 --> 20:25.300
<i>TAYLOR:
Summer!</i>

20:26.100 --> 20:27.500
Summer, where are you?

20:29.700 --> 20:30.700
Summer?

20:32.300 --> 20:35.000
God, you call someone, the
least you can do is show up...

20:37.600 --> 20:38.600
Ryan, what are you doing here?

20:38.600 --> 20:40.900
I had Summer call you. I'm
sorry. I wanted to talk to you.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.900
Well, it worked, weasel.

20:43.500 --> 20:44.400
What do you want?

20:44.500 --> 20:46.300
I wanted to apologize.
I made a mistake.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.400
When?
When you abandoned me

20:49.400 --> 20:51.000
on the set
of a French talk show?

20:51.200 --> 20:52.500
Or when you didn't
call me for a week?

20:53.300 --> 20:54.200
All of the above?

20:54.900 --> 20:56.100
Well, you hurt me, Ryan.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.600
Why couldn't you just have had faith in us?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.900
I don't know, I guess I thought
we were too different.

21:04.900 --> 21:05.500
????

21:05.600 --> 21:06.700
No, I know I wasn't.

21:06.700 --> 21:10.700
And I realize now that how we
feel is much more important than what we have to talk about.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
And how do you feel?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
I...

21:24.900 --> 21:25.500
I...

21:25.500 --> 21:28.000
That stuffed animal
that you bought me is more expressive, Ryan.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.600
Henri-Michel
is reading a poem that he wrote for me at
the bookstore tomorrow night.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.700
*It's a love poem, Ryan,
and it's long.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Hey, no snoozing, man.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.500
You drift off to dreamland now,
this whole thing is for naught.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.900
You know, the Australian aboriginals believed...

21:58.900 --> 22:00.200
Shut up, Che.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.800
Little cranky today, are we?

22:01.800 --> 22:02.900
I'm deranged.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.400
I haven't been to sleep,
I haven't eaten.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.800
Hey, I got to break you down
before we build you back up.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.400
Now go gather rocks.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.000
Okay, bye.
Bye.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.000
All done.
She took it pretty well.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.500
Excuse me.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.800
Fiona.
Hi.

22:28.300 --> 22:30.600
Hi. I'm really sorry
to have to tell you this.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.500
One of Julie's boys...

22:34.200 --> 22:35.800
Julie will pay for all
the medical costs.

22:39.100 --> 22:43.100
What kind of unclean operation
are you people running?

22:43.900 --> 22:45.000
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.800
Look, I understand that
you're really upset,

22:46.800 --> 22:48.500
but I don't think you want
to take this to court.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.400
The publicity alone...

22:49.400 --> 22:51.400
Don't look at me.

22:51.900 --> 22:52.700
Just...

22:54.300 --> 22:56.100
Oh, my God.

22:58.600 --> 22:59.500
That was brilliant.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.200
You had to do one thing.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.500
I choked, I'm sorry.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.200
I promise, next person
I really will tell.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.400
Or we could get our
nails done.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.600
Oh, okay.

23:17.800 --> 23:21.800
So what do Brutus, Judas,
Benedict Arnold,

23:21.900 --> 23:23.800
Julius Rosenberg,
Ethel Rosenberg,

23:23.800 --> 23:25.700
although that's debatable,and you have in common?

23:25.700 --> 23:27.100
Uh, we all did what
we thought was right.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.700
Eyes rolling.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.200
I'm sorry about yesterday, okay?

23:30.300 --> 23:32.300
But Ryan looked like
a poor, sad koala bear,

23:32.300 --> 23:33.300
and I'm trying to help animals.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.000
Yeah, why does your room
look like a bird cage?

23:35.400 --> 23:37.000
Because I decided its
time to get off my butt

23:37.000 --> 23:38.400
and do something
with my life.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.700
I'm going to start a nonprofit.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.700
You know, I read that if you can
just focus on saving one animal,

23:42.700 --> 23:43.600
you can really
make an impact.

23:44.100 --> 23:45.300
Did you read
this article?

23:45.700 --> 23:48.500
It's how we're giving elephants
post-traumatic stress disorder.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.600
Those poor elephants.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.800
All they want is to be
cared for and nurtured

23:52.800 --> 23:55.400
and not left on the set of a European talk show

23:55.400 --> 23:57.500
after party by their
stupid, stupid...

23:57.600 --> 23:58.300
Ryan?
Yeah.

23:58.300 --> 23:59.500
And speaking of stupid,

23:59.500 --> 24:02.100
did you see the total Quickie Mart teddy
bear that he brought me?

24:03.100 --> 24:04.600
Ryan bought you
a stuffed animal?

24:05.300 --> 24:06.200
Oh, my God.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.500
Look, in all the time
I've known him,

24:07.500 --> 24:09.300
I've never seen him do
anything so sweet.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.400
Never?

24:11.400 --> 24:12.100
Never.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.700
That's probably the
nicest gift he's ever given.

24:15.900 --> 24:16.600
Oh.

24:17.900 --> 24:18.900
I, uh,

24:19.500 --> 24:20.500
I should go.

24:31.100 --> 24:31.800
Hey.

24:31.800 --> 24:32.500
Hey

24:32.800 --> 24:33.600
You going for a run?

24:33.700 --> 24:35.400
Yeah, I'm just trying
to clear my head.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.900
Yeah, I saw that your light was
on pretty late last night.

24:38.600 --> 24:39.300
Yeah.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.700
Yeah, I was trying to think
of a good gift for Taylor.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.000
Oh, so what did you
come up with?

24:44.200 --> 24:46.700
You know the Quickie Mart
down by the pier?
Yeah?

24:46.700 --> 24:49.400
They had a special on a bear
with a mug of candy.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.400
So you didn't quite hit it
out of the park, did you?

24:51.400 --> 24:53.000
I may have done
more harm than good.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.400
You know, it is obvious
to almost everyone

24:57.500 --> 24:59.300
that Taylor feels very
strongly about you.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.300
Well, Henri-Michel
said he loved her.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.400
He wrote her a book and he's
performing some poem about it.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.900
And then she asked me
if I felt the same...

25:08.300 --> 25:09.400
You couldn't say anything.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.000
Between us,

25:12.300 --> 25:13.400
how do you feel about her?

25:13.800 --> 25:16.000
Well, being with Taylor's like

25:16.300 --> 25:17.400
being on a roller coaster.

25:17.700 --> 25:19.600
And that's what, unsettling?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.400
For a guy who's afraid
of heights,

25:21.600 --> 25:23.200
it's not exactly the best fit,
but, uh...

25:24.700 --> 25:26.100
I don't know,
it's exciting I guess.

25:26.300 --> 25:28.300
Tell her that, before
it's too late.

25:28.300 --> 25:29.200
Tell her that.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.800
This is all I know.
Hmm?

25:30.800 --> 25:31.900
A situation like this,

25:31.900 --> 25:33.500
you could do something,
you could do nothing.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.000
It's as simple as that.

25:37.000 --> 25:37.800
All right.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.400
Do something.Yeah, see you around.

25:42.300 --> 25:43.300
A mug!

25:54.700 --> 25:55.800
Hi, you're home.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.200
What are you doing
with the refuse?

25:58.800 --> 26:02.000
I was making sure that the maid
service here is efficient.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.900
Or looking for Ryan's mug
of stale candy and bear

26:06.900 --> 26:08.000
that holds a balloon?

26:09.200 --> 26:11.200
Well, the guy did get me a gift,

26:11.200 --> 26:13.000
and the balloon was
really shiny.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.600
Peaches, there is no shame
in wanting to keep a gift

26:16.600 --> 26:18.000
that was bought for you
by a lover.

26:19.400 --> 26:19.900
Really?

26:19.900 --> 26:22.500
It makes one feel special
to know that they were adored.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.300
Well, I don't know if I would
use the word adored exactly.

26:25.300 --> 26:28.600
But the problem lies in whether
you are wanting a memento,

26:30.300 --> 26:31.500
or wanting Ryan.

26:33.500 --> 26:37.400
I want to be with somebody who
really wants to be with me,

26:38.200 --> 26:39.600
and who's not afraid to say it.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.500
Well, in that case, you better
tape your socks down,

26:43.500 --> 26:46.300
because my poem is going
to knock them right off.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.000
I must dress.

26:49.000 --> 26:49.800
Okay.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.800
Yeah, the rocks are hot.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.000
So now we got to get them all
moist and sweaty.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Then we can sleep?

27:02.400 --> 27:04.300
As soon as you shovel these
rocks into the tent.

27:04.300 --> 27:06.000
Unless you're too weak
from hunger.

27:06.100 --> 27:09.900
No, I um, actually, I found some
berries down below.

27:09.900 --> 27:11.000
They were pretty tasty, so...

27:12.400 --> 27:13.500
You ate the berries?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.900
Yeah, why?
Is that a problem?

27:18.100 --> 27:19.500
No, dude, it's no problem.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Not yet.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.100
This is all I could use
at the time.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.800
I didn't have anything else.

27:33.100 --> 27:33.900
Hey, guys.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.600
Oh, Kaitlin, glad
you made it.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.300
Will was just telling me a story

27:37.300 --> 27:39.300
about how he lost his
drumsticks.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.000
But luckily he had Chinese that night

27:42.300 --> 27:45.000
so he used his chopsticks.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.200
Okay, well, that's definitely
a knee-slapper.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.900
Will, do you mind getting me a soda?

27:52.100 --> 27:53.500
Sure. You want to come?

27:53.600 --> 27:56.300
Um, actually, I'm going to stay
here and talk to Lucy.
All right.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.200
Just so you have it clear--

28:00.200 --> 28:01.300
the only reason
I'm here is

28:01.300 --> 28:02.800
because I know you don't want me to be.

28:03.800 --> 28:04.800
So get ready to have some fun.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.100
Oh, I'm having fun.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.000
Lots of fun.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.600
You're in our world now.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.700
And girls like you
aren't welcome here.

28:12.300 --> 28:13.300
Girls like me.

28:13.700 --> 28:17.000
What, girls who don't like
wearing polyester pantsuits

28:17.000 --> 28:19.500
or baking pies
or wearing lame feathered hats?

28:20.200 --> 28:21.100
Everything okay?

28:21.400 --> 28:22.200
Not really.

28:22.900 --> 28:26.100
Kaitlin just insulted
our uniforms and called our hats lame.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.800
Actually, they kind of are.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.200
I have to go to the bathroom.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.500
How are you feeling, friend?

28:59.800 --> 29:02.000
Like I'm sharing a sauna
with Blue Man Group.

29:02.000 --> 29:02.900
Go with it.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.300
You're in the spirit world, man.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.100
This is the very last part
of your journey.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.500
Ryan likes Journey.

29:11.900 --> 29:15.100
Soft of eye, light of touch,
speak little,

29:15.700 --> 29:16.900
listen much.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.400
(echoing):
Dad?

29:26.500 --> 29:27.500
Mom?

29:31.300 --> 29:32.500
Che?

29:44.700 --> 29:45.500
Che?

29:46.500 --> 29:47.800
I'm scared.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.700
Oh, I guess that's the idea.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.500
Is that you making
all that noise?

30:12.100 --> 30:13.700
I can hear you.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.800
What's that, little fella?
You don't feel well?

30:17.500 --> 30:19.500
That's okay, I can
take care of you.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.700
I don't exactly know what that
means, but maybe,

30:22.700 --> 30:24.700
maybe I can get you back in the ocean

30:25.000 --> 30:26.700
with all your
otter friends.

30:26.900 --> 30:30.900
And you can do otter-related
activities.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.200
Don't worry.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.800
I'm here.
It's going to be okay.

30:40.100 --> 30:41.000
Whoa.

30:41.800 --> 30:42.900
Oh, Che.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.400
Che, wake up.

30:47.100 --> 30:48.200
I had the greatest dream.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.300
Me, too, man.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.400
And I just healed
my animal spirit.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.900
I've got to get back
home to Summer.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.900
Mazel tov, brother, what
an amazing accomplishment.

30:55.900 --> 30:57.300
Well, tell me about
your spirit animal.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.300
Oh, it was so cute, man.

30:59.300 --> 31:00.200
?????

31:00.200 --> 31:01.500
It was this otter,

31:01.500 --> 31:03.200
and it was lost.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.000
??? An otter?

31:04.200 --> 31:06.200
Yeah, why is that okay?

31:07.300 --> 31:08.200
Yes.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.000
Is that bad?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.900
No, I mean, it's amazing.

31:12.900 --> 31:13.500
Good.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.500
Great, because I thought, like,

31:15.700 --> 31:18.300
it would suck if it wasn't.
But we should get out of here.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.600
"The tree from whence
she fell is blessed.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.100
"He held her
for the world to see,

31:27.100 --> 31:29.400
"but now
to my deep distress,

31:30.400 --> 31:31.800
"my little peach...

31:34.500 --> 31:35.700
is holding me."

31:43.000 --> 31:44.200
I would give anything,

31:44.700 --> 31:47.200
anything for a man
to write a poem like that for me.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.200
That was simply...

31:50.200 --> 31:51.300
wow.

31:51.800 --> 31:55.500
Um, if you'd care to stay,
and who wouldn't,

31:56.200 --> 31:57.400
the author will be signing

31:57.400 --> 32:00.500
<i>copies of his book,
A Season For Peaches.</i>

32:00.500 --> 32:01.400
Wait.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.300
Ryan, what are you doing?

32:09.500 --> 32:10.800
???

32:13.100 --> 32:14.400
Young man,
this is not karaoke.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.800
You don't get a turn.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.600
Get down from there before I call security.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.500
Let's hear what
the boy has to say, hmm?

32:22.000 --> 32:22.900
We should not deny him

32:22.900 --> 32:26.300
the opportunity to bear his soul
in front of all these people.

32:30.800 --> 32:31.700
Thank you.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.700
"A sonnet...

32:38.100 --> 32:39.700
"I don't know how to write.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.300
"A haiku,

32:43.900 --> 32:46.800
"Five, seven, five,

32:48.700 --> 32:52.300
Seems... too tight."

32:53.000 --> 32:54.300
I'm sorry,
I think this is a bad idea.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.900
"Then there are three little
words I'm not able to say.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.500
"But Taylor, this is what
I can tell you today.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.400
"Though I can't say those words
to you tonight,

33:06.500 --> 33:10.500
please stick with me,
'cause I feel someday I might."

33:15.900 --> 33:17.800
WOMAN:
That's not too bad.

33:20.600 --> 33:21.600
Now, uh,

33:21.800 --> 33:24.800
Monsieur de Momourant
will be signing copies

33:24.800 --> 33:27.900
in the, um, um... Monsieur?

33:29.100 --> 33:30.000
Monsieur?

33:31.800 --> 33:33.000
Look, uh, Taylor,

33:33.000 --> 33:36.300
I know that my poem might not be
quite as good as Henri-Michel's,

33:36.300 --> 33:37.700
but I wanted you
to know how I feel.

33:37.700 --> 33:38.700
No, Ryan, I loved it.

33:38.700 --> 33:39.900
I really...
Where is he?

33:39.900 --> 33:40.900
He was just here.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.200
I'm sorry.

33:48.000 --> 33:48.700
<i>JULIE:
We had a good day.</i>

33:48.700 --> 33:50.400
Three out of five women now
know they've been exposed

33:50.400 --> 33:52.600
to a sexually-transmitted
disease, we should be proud.

33:52.800 --> 33:53.900
You're on your own
for the next two.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.100
Okay, I understand.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.500
Aren't you supposed
to be in Mexico?

34:04.400 --> 34:05.400
Julie made me do it.

34:08.300 --> 34:09.300
So you mean...

34:09.400 --> 34:11.199
Yeah, so no one has...

34:13.000 --> 34:13.600
You know.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.400
What?!

34:17.500 --> 34:18.400
Yeah.

34:18.600 --> 34:19.600
I'm going to go.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.400
Kirsten, I'm sorry.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.400
It was the only way
I could think

34:24.400 --> 34:25.800
to get you to spend
the day with me.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.600
So you told all those women they
have chlamydia when they don't?

34:28.600 --> 34:31.100
They might. They did have sex
with male hookers.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.000
Plus, I picked the five meanest
women in Newport.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.699
What is wrong with you?

34:34.699 --> 34:36.300
I was desperate.
I missed you.

34:36.300 --> 34:38.300
I hate not having you
in my life, Kirsten.

34:38.300 --> 34:40.000
I can live without you
as my business partner,

34:40.000 --> 34:41.400
but not without you
as my friend.

34:41.400 --> 34:42.600
You are going to call
all those women tomorrow,

34:42.600 --> 34:44.699
and you are going
to tell them the truth.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.400
Okay, but not Linda.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.199
Please let Linda think
she has an STD.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.400
That is not only unethical,
it is just plain mean.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.300
I disagree. Do you want to
debate about it over dinner?

34:54.800 --> 34:55.500
You know you miss me.

34:55.500 --> 34:56.699
Come on, say yes.

34:58.000 --> 34:58.800
Kirsten?

35:16.600 --> 35:18.000
You know, you been in here
for so long

35:18.000 --> 35:19.400
I was afraid
you got flushed down.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.500
Go away.

35:29.800 --> 35:30.300
Hi.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.000
Go away. I hate you.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.300
Look, I'm sorry that Will
doesn't like you back,

35:36.000 --> 35:37.800
but I didn't do anything.

35:45.300 --> 35:48.100
I have loved Will since the day
he transferred here.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.800
I lent him a pen.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.300
And he is the most wonderful,

35:53.300 --> 35:55.000
sensitive, sweet...

35:55.400 --> 35:57.100
And you don't
even appreciate him.

35:57.100 --> 35:58.400
Yes, I do.

35:58.700 --> 36:02.500
I mean, he's smart and he's hot
and he's an excellent kisser.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.800
Then why do you make fun of
the things that make Will Will?

36:07.200 --> 36:11.000
His band uniform and his love
of marching and baking and his friends?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.500
Because that's just what I do.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.300
I mean, I make fun
of everyone,

36:14.700 --> 36:15.900
usually 'cause I'm high.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.800
You make him not want
to be himself.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.300
You don't know
what you're talking about.

36:22.300 --> 36:25.400
Oh, that's the best you can do?

36:27.700 --> 36:29.900
You know I'm right.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.700
Shut up, okay?

36:32.500 --> 36:33.300
Just shut up.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.300
Henri?

37:13.100 --> 37:15.900
"I love you,
but I love love more.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.100
"And I don't want
to be alone in it.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.500
<i>Au revoir, Peaches.</i>

37:31.700 --> 37:33.100
Hey, I've been worried
about you.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.100
You okay?

37:34.100 --> 37:35.900
Oh, I'm okay.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.200
It's a long story.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.000
Well, I can't wait to hear it.
When are you coming home?

37:40.200 --> 37:41.000
Soon.

37:42.400 --> 37:43.700
I'm having dinner with Julie.

37:46.100 --> 37:47.900
Julie?
Yeah.

37:48.400 --> 37:51.600
She is the most manipulative,
scheming partner in the world,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.300
and it was stupid ever
to get into business with her,

37:54.300 --> 37:55.900
and I'll never make
that mistake again.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.900
But she's the best
friend you got.

37:59.300 --> 38:00.400
Something like that.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.200
WILL:
I was thinking maybe tomorrow
we could do something

38:05.200 --> 38:06.000
you might want to do.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.300
Well, I thought
tomorrow was night two of your dorked-out
bake sale.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.800
I mean, it is,
but they can hold it down.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.200
I mean, I'd rather
spend time with you.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.300
I thought it was
important to you.

38:15.300 --> 38:16.900
If you want me
to do it, I'll do it.

38:16.900 --> 38:17.900
I'll go. I can go.

38:17.900 --> 38:19.600
I just thought,
you know,that

38:19.600 --> 38:21.200
they wouldn't know
what to do without you.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.900
Since you're the king
of dorks and all.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.300
Excuse me?

38:24.300 --> 38:25.300
Well, after
observing you

38:25.300 --> 38:26.700
in your natural
environment,

38:27.700 --> 38:30.200
it was just clear,
we're not a good fit.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.500
We're like oil
and that other thing.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.000
But I thought you liked that.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.600
You know who else is a dork
is that Lucy chick.

38:37.700 --> 38:39.800
I mean, she's got a pretty
hot bod for a dork.

38:39.900 --> 38:43.500
I mean, if I was a dork like
you, I'd totally go for her.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Real nice.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.600
You know what,
I think you're right.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.500
Good, 'cause I think
Brad and Eric

38:48.500 --> 38:50.900
are down there, probably
night surfing or something.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.200
So I'll see you around.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.200
Nah.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.300
Che, what are you
still doing here?

39:13.600 --> 39:15.900
I had a dream.
In my dream,

39:16.300 --> 39:19.500
my spirit animal was a frog
and I was in a stream.

39:20.800 --> 39:24.000
I had the most magical day.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.800
Oh, God, we've got
to change the locks.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.000
Mm!
(gasps)

39:30.000 --> 39:31.300
Whoa, hi.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.900
I healed my spirit animal
and I'm ready to love again.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.200
Did you say spirit animal?

39:35.200 --> 39:36.800
Yeah, and it was lost,
but through my connection

39:36.800 --> 39:38.300
to the ancient rituals
of the Earth,

39:38.300 --> 39:40.200
I was able to save
my inner otter.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.600
<i>CHE:
I swam</i>

39:41.800 --> 39:44.400
and I splashed.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.500
And for the first time,
I felt whole.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.900
I had found my other half.

39:53.900 --> 39:54.900
And it was an otter.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.600
Otters are so cute.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.300
Oh, my gosh, their
whiskers and how they

39:58.300 --> 40:00.500
use their belly to crack
open their abalone dinner.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.800
I am going to start a foundation
to save the sea otters.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.900
Do you know there are less than
3,000 left in California?

40:04.900 --> 40:05.900
No, that's really sad.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.500
You found love
with an otter?

40:10.100 --> 40:11.100
I'm happy for you.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.900
I know it sounds crazy,
but dreams don't lie.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.800
Now I just have
to explain it to the otter.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Summer.
What?

40:18.200 --> 40:20.400
Do you think the otters
could wait till tomorrow?

40:20.500 --> 40:21.300
No.

40:39.000 --> 40:39.600
Hey.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.100
Hi.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.200
Henri-Michel's gone.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.000
He's gone? Gone where?

40:47.500 --> 40:48.800
Back to France, I guess.

40:49.700 --> 40:50.400
Why?

40:51.600 --> 40:55.200
Uh, I think he understood
even better than I did

40:55.200 --> 40:58.300
that as much as he loved me,
I didn't love him,

40:58.300 --> 40:59.700
and I probably never will.

41:02.200 --> 41:05.000
Does that mean...?

41:06.500 --> 41:08.900
When Henri-Michel would tell me
he loved me,

41:09.100 --> 41:12.200
it was like the whole world
melted away.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.600
Those words just have more power
over me than anything.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.500
It's scary
how much I want,

41:20.400 --> 41:23.100
how much I need to hear them.

41:25.200 --> 41:27.200
Well, if that's important
to you...

41:27.200 --> 41:29.300
I would never ask you
to be able to say that yet.

41:30.200 --> 41:33.600
And even if you could, I don't
think I'm ready to hear it.

41:35.500 --> 41:36.400
So what are you saying?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.900
Until I can be stronger
on my own,

41:38.900 --> 41:41.100
I don't think that I should be
with anyone,

41:42.500 --> 41:43.400
including you.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.300
I'm sorry.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.300
Okay.

41:50.100 --> 41:50.900
Uh...

41:52.700 --> 41:54.300
Actually, that makes sense.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.100
But I'm going to treasure
this poem forever.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.600
I meant it.

42:03.900 --> 42:04.900
Just so you know.

42:08.100 --> 42:08.800
I do.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.300
Bye, Ryan.

42:17.305 --> 42:23.415
