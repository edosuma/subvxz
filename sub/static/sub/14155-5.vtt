I CAN HEAR SARCASM.

40:11.833 --> 40:14.300

WE CAN PRETEND TO BELIEVE YOU.

40:15.333 --> 40:16.833

40:16.867 --> 40:21.100

40:30.400 --> 40:32.500

40:53.200 --> 40:56.167

40:56.200 --> 40:57.967
I'M GOING ON A MAN CLEANSE.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.200

ABOUT YOUR SMILE.

41:00.233 --> 41:01.567

41:01.600 --> 41:02.933

SOME SERIOUS EXTRA CREDIT.

41:04.700 --> 41:06.500
DARRYL'S TRYING TO MAKE GOOD
ON HIS THREAT TO TAKE

41:06.533 --> 41:08.033
HALF MY TRUST FUND.

41:08.067 --> 41:09.533
I CANNOT BELIEVE
HOW YOU'RE ACTING.

41:09.567 --> 41:11.000
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE MY WIFE
SCREWED THE MAYOR.

41:11.033 --> 41:13.567
BUT MY NEW BMW HELPS ME
WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.533
PUT YOUR SHOULDER BLADES
TOGETHER.

41:15.567 --> 41:19.033
MAYBE WE SHOULD DO
THESE EXERCISES ON THE COUCH.

41:19.067 --> 41:22.933

DON'T NEED ANYONE TO KEEP *

41:22.967 --> 41:26.733
