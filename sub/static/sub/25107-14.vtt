00:35.577 --> 00:37.912
[George Sr.] Very disappointed
with these swimsuits.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.789
- That's right.
- [George Sr.] What's with the shirts?

00:39.873 --> 00:42.167
You better bring it to the talent portion,
Michael!

00:42.250 --> 00:43.835
A little more Magnum, PI,

00:43.918 --> 00:46.004
- a little less Higgins.
- [both laugh]

00:46.337 --> 00:48.131
Looking for a little Magnum, PI?

00:48.214 --> 00:51.468
Oh, for God sakes.
Is that Stan Sitwell's eyebrow?

00:51.551 --> 00:54.095
I... I... I just told him
he didn't leave it here!

00:54.179 --> 00:56.431
- [knocking on door]
- [Lucille] Get that off your face,

- you horse's ass.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.147
- [woman] Guess who!
- [George Sr.] Mimi.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.235
Mom.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.238
I should have called.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.116
Hi! [chuckles]

01:15.200 --> 01:17.285
[gasps] Look at you!

01:18.369 --> 01:19.829
Look at all of you,

01:19.913 --> 01:22.290
rushing your Mimi... [sighs]

01:22.373 --> 01:23.625
This is your grandmother.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.670
- [George Sr.] Kids, rush your Mimi.
- What are you doing here, Mom?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.672
Well, I wasn't gonna miss the last summer

01:29.756 --> 01:32.008
at the beach house
with my gorgeous family.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.636

No. No,

01:38.848 --> 01:40.767
- I... I meant... I did... I <i>missed </i> this...
- Yeah.

someone's got a big birthday coming up.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.816
Where's my Lindsay?

01:48.566 --> 01:49.943
[Lindsay] Right here.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.069
- Hi, Mimi.
- [Mimi gasps]

01:51.152 --> 01:53.154
And it's really not
that big of a birthday.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.281
I mean, I'm just turning 14.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.492
And Michael is, too,
because they're twins.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.620
[whispers] Of course you are.

02:00.912 --> 02:01.746
I'm Gob.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.082
Uh... Why did you name him that?

02:04.165 --> 02:06.417
Mother, we haven't seen you
in five years.

02:06.501 --> 02:09.002
You don't need to come in here
and criticize my children

02:09.086 --> 02:11.464
- in the middle of a pageant. We're...
- Oh!

02:11.548 --> 02:13.591
Oh, you kept that tradition?
Did your mother tell you

02:13.675 --> 02:16.970
- that I'm the one who started that?
- [Lucille] Well, that's true,

02:17.053 --> 02:19.764
but you never let me wear the sash
when I was little.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.766
Oh, please, you were never little.
[laughs]

02:21.850 --> 02:24.144
[quietly] Your mother was never little.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.187
[children chuckling]

02:27.313 --> 02:28.815
[gasps] Oh, but this is perfect,

02:28.898 --> 02:30.650
'cause I have a prize
for one of the kids.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.194
We already have a trophy for the winner.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.904
It has a little magician on it.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.865
[Lucille] Yes, for whoever wins.

02:36.948 --> 02:39.868
They didn't have one
with a boy doing push-ups.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.870
[Mimi] All right.
The trophy can be your prize.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.914
My prize is for whoever
I deem to be the winner.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.500
It's an all-expense paid cruise...

02:48.001 --> 02:50.920
- with her grandmother.
- [dramatic instrumental music plays]

02:54.549 --> 02:57.427
All right, kids, why don't you get ready
for the, uh, talent portion?

02:57.510 --> 02:59.304
- Let the grown-ups talk.
- [Mimi] Mm-hmm.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.099
You know,
I've been in the house five minutes.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.226
You haven't even offered me
so much as a pitcher of martinis.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.645
I'll make two.

03:08.396 --> 03:11.191
- [door closes]
- [Lucille] So, you're not taking a cruise

03:11.274 --> 03:15.153
- with Uncle Jack this year?
- Uh, no. No.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.946
Jack dumped me. [sniffles]

03:17.030 --> 03:18.323
He says he wants to start

03:18.406 --> 03:20.950
- a clean slate on his 80th birthday.
- [cocktail shaker rattles]

03:21.242 --> 03:24.078
Ah, well, anyway,
I just thought the cruise

03:24.162 --> 03:26.456
would be the perfect gift
for whoever wins.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.125
I know what you're up to.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.169
You're not taking Lindsay.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.924
Well, soon, Lindsay will be old enough
to make that decision for herself.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.551
And I know you won't let me take Buster.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.512
My God, when he was three years old,
you still had him on a leash! [laughs]

03:41.596 --> 03:44.015
I said, "She's gonna make
a murderer out of that one."

03:44.349 --> 03:47.936
Oh, but we're getting ahead of ourselves!
Let's see who wins the competition.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.270
And I can be a judge.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.149
Never too early to get Buster used
to being in front of a judge.

[Barry] Hi! Oh, hi.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.336
- I've saved you some seats right here.
- Okay. Thank you.

04:13.711 --> 04:14.671
Right in front, right...

04:14.754 --> 04:17.714
[Ron] <i>But there was nothing</i>
<i>that could prepare them for the shock</i>

- [gasps]
<i>- ...of seeing the bailiff</i>

04:19.466 --> 04:22.220
<i>- lead their son into the courtroom.</i>
- [Lucille] I cannot believe this.

04:22.303 --> 04:26.266
This is the guy who used to bring me out
during my trials.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.477
- Oh, God, it's great to see you, Chuck.
- Oh! I remember Chuck.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.688
- You used to catch him when he'd run.
- Actually,

04:31.771 --> 04:35.233
- I'm Chuck's son.
- No. You're little CJ?

04:35.316 --> 04:37.193
- [CJ] Mm-hmm.
- Your parents must be so proud.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.280
[chuckles] Well, I'm sure every parent
is proud of their...

04:43.199 --> 04:45.535
Well, why don't I just chain your boy
to the bench here?

04:45.618 --> 04:48.204

04:51.582 --> 04:54.127
Is there anybody else
you'd like to say hello to, Mother?

04:54.210 --> 04:56.045
At least I came to your trial.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.799
For mine, you were too busy juicing it up
with that woman you probably pushed...

05:00.008 --> 05:01.509
- [in singsong voice] Careful.
- Yep.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.386
- You look different.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.763
I'm growing dreads, Mother.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.890
Dreads right out of my head.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.643
Just because you have
an African-American left hand,

05:10.727 --> 05:12.312
all of a sudden you're Ray Charles?

05:12.645 --> 05:15.565

that was less... threatening.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.524

- Hi.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.110
- Hello.
- Michael, what are you doing here?

05:19.444 --> 05:21.821
You kidding me?
I want to see our legal team in action.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.073
I mean, we're certainly spending a fortune
on them.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.784
[Ron] <i>It was a legal team</i>
<i>that Barry had suggested.</i>

05:26.868 --> 05:27.827

- [judge] How do you plead?
<i>- ...was abandoned</i>

05:45.303 --> 05:48.473
<i>early on by Netflix
as not being binge-worthy.</i>

05:48.639 --> 05:51.100
[Michael] Where is this team
we're spending all our money on?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.353
And... And please tell me
that it is not Barry.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.605
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm just here as a fan.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.607
And for the referral fee.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.567
I'm gonna go in the hall
and see if they're here.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.444
- Okay.
- [Barry] I'm gonna try and get a selfie

06:01.527 --> 06:04.405
- with the G-Man.
- Shouldn't you be working on the wall?

06:04.489 --> 06:07.075
Uh, you know what? I wanna...
I want to take a step back.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.826
I want to let my son flap his wings a bit.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.121
Oh, God. Did he take another swing at you?

06:12.413 --> 06:14.749
[clicks tongue]
No, that... that's not what he did.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.959
George Michael fired you?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.754
[Ron] <i>That </i> is <i>what he did.</i>

06:19.837 --> 06:22.840
<i>But it was only after Michael,
having discovered his parents</i>

06:22.924 --> 06:25.718
<i>were in cahoots
with Chinese investors to build</i>

06:25.802 --> 06:29.347
<i>a border wall,
secretly spent the investors' money</i>

06:29.430 --> 06:31.307
<i>to merge with his son's company...</i>

06:31.391 --> 06:33.226
<i>- I </i> bought Fakeblock.
- What?

06:33.309 --> 06:35.520
[Ron] <i>...provoking a dire warning</i>
<i>from his parents.</i>

06:35.603 --> 06:38.064
They're going to be mildly displeased.

06:38.147 --> 06:40.733
[Ron] <i>And though he refused</i>
<i>to doom his son's company</i>

06:40.817 --> 06:42.902
<i>- by selling it...</i>
- No, no. No, no, no, no.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.570
George Michael's
got nothing to do with this.

06:44.654 --> 06:49.409
[Ron] <i>...a package from China threatened</i>
<i>a more literal sort of defeat,</i>

06:49.492 --> 06:52.245
<i>which is how Michael came to announce
both that he was building</i>

06:52.328 --> 06:54.914
<i>- a border wall...</i>
- ...just for this project.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.333
[Ron] <i>...and that it was the reason</i>
<i>he purchased Fakeblock</i>

06:57.417 --> 06:59.752
<i>- in the first place.</i>
- [Michael speaking indistinctly]

06:59.836 --> 07:02.672
[Ron] <i>George Michael felt bulldozed</i>
<i>by the announcement.</i>

07:02.755 --> 07:03.965
[George Michael] What the [bleep]!?

07:04.048 --> 07:07.009
- [Ron] <i>Even though it was Gob...</i>
- We're building a wall!

07:07.093 --> 07:08.052
Come back in two weeks!

07:08.136 --> 07:10.513
[Ron] <i>...who moved up the date</i>
<i>of the unveiling,</i>

07:10.596 --> 07:11.931
<i>which is what led to this.</i>

07:12.014 --> 07:13.850
- We're gonna need it in a month.
- You're fired.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.937
Which, because of the merger,
he had the right to do, but don't worry.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.606
The wall's gonna be fine. Gob's on it.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.733
I don't want George Michael
feeling guilty,

07:22.817 --> 07:24.819
so I told Gob,
when it comes to the foot,

07:24.902 --> 07:27.196
- that mum's the word.
- [Ron] <i>Although "clear" might've been</i>

07:27.280 --> 07:28.614
<i>- an overstatement.</i>
- It was a great move

07:28.698 --> 07:31.409
to get ridof your dad.
Can't let fear run a business.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.702
How do you mean, fear?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.872
Well, you get sent one severed foot
from the Chinese,

07:35.955 --> 07:37.832
and, all of a sudden,
you turn into a crybaby.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.668
The Chinese sent my dad
a severed human foot?

07:40.751 --> 07:42.712
Yeah. Although they call it a "mum."

07:42.795 --> 07:46.340
Mum's the word
for "severed human foot" in Chinese.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.468
I don't even know how I know that.
But it's to ensure

07:48.551 --> 07:50.511
that he finishes building the wall
or whatever.

07:50.595 --> 07:54.056
It's like, you know what?
Like, call me after you've been lured down

07:54.140 --> 07:55.850
to a rock quarry,
and someone threatens

07:55.933 --> 07:57.477
to ruin your magic career

07:57.560 --> 08:00.480
if you go to gay conversion therapy,
and it works. [chuckles]

08:00.563 --> 08:03.399
I mean, seriously, call me after that,

08:03.483 --> 08:06.235
because I'd be curious
to see how... how you'd handle it.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.572
[Lucille] <i>Well, having a child</i>
<i>try to embarrass you</i>

08:09.655 --> 08:11.699
is part of parenting, sweetheart.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.912
Mine's chained to a bench.
So, in that sense, he's an overachiever.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.288
- [door opens]
- [CJ] All rise.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.082

of Orange County is now in session.

The Honorable Judge Spencer Stanley
presiding.

08:23.669 --> 08:24.962
Please be seated.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.174
- CJ, let me get to the chair.
- [CJ] Sorry.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.801
[Stanley] Does Defense have
a counsel ready?

08:30.927 --> 08:33.596
Uh... not quite yet, Your Honor.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.724
Someone care to explain to me why
there's no one to represent the client?

08:36.807 --> 08:40.436
- [upbeat theme music playing]
- They're here! The Guilty Guys are here.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.812
Oh, it's the Guilty Guys?

08:41.895 --> 08:43.773
They're here. They're actually here.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.650
- They're coming down the hall.
- [CJ] All rise

08:45.733 --> 08:48.361
- for the Guilty Guys.
- CJ, you don't have to... [sighs]

08:48.819 --> 08:51.489
Okay, great. Now I can't see.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.492
[Ron] <i>And so,</i>
<i>perhaps as an intimidation tactic,</i>

08:54.575 --> 08:56.619
<i>the Guilty Guys finally arrived,</i>

<i>on full display.</i>

09:01.207 --> 09:04.168
<i>It was hard for anyone
not to get caught up in the pageantry.</i>

09:04.252 --> 09:05.211
Uh, Barry?

09:06.337 --> 09:07.797
[cart squeaks]

09:08.756 --> 09:10.758
[Stanley] On the count
of murder in the first degree,

09:10.925 --> 09:12.468
how does the defendant plead?

09:15.221 --> 09:17.014
- [Anita clears throat]
- Your Honor, in the case

09:17.098 --> 09:19.725
of <i>The State of California</i>
<i>v. Buster Bluth,</i>

09:19.809 --> 09:22.019
we'd like to enter a plea of... guilty.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.106
Hmm. Okay. Let's set a date
for a sentencing presentation.

09:25.856 --> 09:29.026
And on a personal note,
I just want to say that it is not often

09:29.110 --> 09:31.988
in the course of a jurisprudence career
that a judge has the...

09:32.071 --> 09:34.699
- I want to say privilege...
- Sorry. Did...

09:34.782 --> 09:36.951
Did... Did you say... Did they say guilty?

09:37.702 --> 09:39.662
[Barry] Look at that.
There is always a guy

09:39.745 --> 09:41.664
who wants to know what's going on.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.832
It's why I could never go

09:42.915 --> 09:44.834
- to the movies with my father.
- Hello? Not!

09:45.668 --> 09:47.712
We'd like to plead <i>not </i> guilty, Your Honor.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.798
Not guilty?
You hired <i>us </i> to plead not guilty?

09:50.881 --> 09:52.508
[scoffs] Well, that's a first.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.510
- [Michael] Barry, what's going on?
- [Barry] Yeah?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.678
[Michael] What's happening?

09:56.262 --> 09:57.930
You didn't want to plead guilty?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.891
Of course not! Buster's not guilty.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.102
Well, then, these are not the guys.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.062
No, I thought I told you that

10:05.146 --> 10:07.607
if I was guilty,
then I would hire these guys,

10:07.940 --> 10:09.358
'cause they get the best sentences.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.029
You're saying
these guys cannot represent us

10:13.112 --> 10:14.614
in... in a not guilty plea?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.198
Why would you want to pay them
for two months?

10:16.490 --> 10:18.701
I don't think they've ever been
on a case that long.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.703
[Ron] <i>Which was</i>
<i>the same problem the producers</i>

10:20.786 --> 10:23.623
<i>of the Netflix series had,
and actually why it was canceled</i>

10:23.706 --> 10:25.207
- <i>before the end of the main title.</i>
- Your Honor,

10:25.291 --> 10:26.917
we'd like to enter a plea of...

10:27.251 --> 10:28.085
guilty.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.840
- Oh, honest to God, Barry...
- [Barry] Okay.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.300
Okay, let me take care of this.

10:34.592 --> 10:38.387
Can I just ask,
would you mind staying on the case

10:38.471 --> 10:39.555
if it's not guilty?

10:40.765 --> 10:43.434
- Sidebar, please. Sidebar.
<i>- </i> [Ron] <i>And, true to their reputation,</i>

10:43.517 --> 10:44.602
<i>this pivotal moment</i>

10:44.685 --> 10:46.395
<i>would also prove anti-climactic.</i>

10:46.604 --> 10:48.606
- Hey, yeah, we're out. We just can't...
- Really?

10:48.689 --> 10:50.775
- We can't defend their son. Bye.
- [sighs]

10:51.359 --> 10:53.569
- [all cheering and whooping]
- [Jack] Yeah! Yes!

10:53.653 --> 10:55.237
- Yes!
- [Shara] We did it!

10:55.571 --> 10:58.074
They're out.
We won't be hearing from them again.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.576
Except for what they're gonna charge us
for the phone call.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.870
- They've never technically won a case...
- Mm-hmm.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.830
...but they've never lost a fee.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.124
Of course,
the bad news is Lottie is pushing

11:07.208 --> 11:08.668
to get this on the docket
within the month.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.671
- But we don't have an attorney.
- [Barry] Well, that's what I said.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.214
This DA, she is a killer.

11:13.547 --> 11:16.258
She has never lost a case.
Well, just once.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.844
But then,
her ex was the opposing counsel.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.263
Well, that's our answer.
We gotta get him as our attorney.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.890
Oh, no. He's retired.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.643
Which is too bad,
because she was so flustered

11:25.726 --> 11:27.853
by his argument,
she called for a mistrial.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.649
I have never seen Lottie Dottie cower
like that before.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.276
Of course,
she was called Lottie Radler back then.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.112
- Lottie Radler?
- Yeah.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.364
What's her ex-husband's name?

11:39.407 --> 11:42.284
- Dustin.
- Uh-uh. She means <i>Lottie's </i> ex.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.037
Dustin Radler, the guy you're dating.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.580
No, it can't be.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.083
I mean, he said he was retired, but,

11:49.166 --> 11:52.420
uh... I have to get him on this case.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.172
Well, I don't think
he's gonna do it for free.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.174
I'll let him move in.
That's what he wants.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.720
No, no, no, no.
You're so close to ending it with him.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.180
I mean, I...
You don't want to be leading him on.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.474
We have to get our son off,

12:05.558 --> 12:08.644
and in three weeks,
a mistrial is the only thing in our favor.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.187
So that's my choice?

12:10.855 --> 12:13.107
Between my wife and my son?

12:13.190 --> 12:14.608
[Barry] Isn't that the worst?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.694
Especially when you're checking
into a hotel.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.113
Here's my advice.
Always say that he's your wife,

12:19.196 --> 12:21.073
'cause they never have the balls to check.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.119
I'm out of context again, aren't I?

12:27.955 --> 12:29.206
[quietly] I'm so sorry.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.086
[Ron] <i>After firing his father,</i>
<i>George Michael</i>

12:34.170 --> 12:36.172
<i>was visited by Maeby,</i>

12:36.255 --> 12:38.215
<i>who had father problems of her own.</i>

12:38.299 --> 12:40.968
[Maeby] ...about being a backup person
in the Blue Man Group,

12:41.302 --> 12:44.138
when he realizes that Marge is over,
so of course he yells,

12:44.513 --> 12:47.057
"Voices up."
And then I gotta hear Mrs. Featherbottom

12:47.141 --> 12:50.436
cover by saying she meant
"makeup," not "backup" person,

12:50.936 --> 12:52.897
and then go on to brag that,
for four years,

12:52.980 --> 12:54.482
she blew three men five times a day,

12:54.565 --> 12:56.150
and now we've been called
before the board

12:56.233 --> 12:59.403
- for the third time.
- Well, why don't you ask them to move out?

12:59.487 --> 13:02.114
It's not that easy.
Remember when your dad lived with you?

13:02.782 --> 13:05.993
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
we had to do some crazy vote-out thing

13:06.076 --> 13:09.205
where he... he forgot how voting worked.
He voted for himself.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.291
[Ron] <i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was a deeply complicated plan</i>

13:12.374 --> 13:14.877
<i>that required Michael believing
he was voting out</i>

13:14.960 --> 13:18.255
<i>a third roommate, only to discover</i>

13:18.547 --> 13:20.466
<i>that the three turned on him...</i>

13:20.841 --> 13:23.010
Michael. Michael. Michael.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.638
[Ron] <i>...leading to a sense of betrayal</i>

13:25.721 --> 13:28.766
<i>that neither father nor son
would soon recover from.</i>

13:28.849 --> 13:31.018
[Maeby] <i>Oh.</i>
<i>I just remember it working, so,</i>

13:31.101 --> 13:32.311
maybe a vote will do it.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.104
But you better watch out,

13:34.188 --> 13:36.148
because the gang's gonna try
and live with you

13:36.232 --> 13:38.734
- at Sudden Valley.
- Well, with all the construction going on

13:38.818 --> 13:40.444
right now, they wouldn't get through.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.071
Construction for what?

13:43.239 --> 13:44.073
The wall.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.117
You're building the wall?
I thought that's why you fired your dad.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.620
Yeah, well, that was before I realized...

13:49.995 --> 13:51.372
there was something else...

13:52.164 --> 13:52.998
afoot.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.502
George Michael, you can't do that.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.796
Building that wall is gonna affect
real people.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.714
[George Michael] I don't have the luxury
of worrying about that.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.299
Someone's gotta protect this family.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.926
Well, what about <i>their </i> families?

14:04.009 --> 14:06.887
I got to know some of those people
when I was working in that border town,

14:06.971 --> 14:08.472
acting like I was getting to know
those people.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.225
You sound just like
a slightly self-aware Aunt Lindsay.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.144
Well, you sound
just like a minimally-woke Uncle Michael.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.564
I'm not gonna go into this,
because I don't want you getting involved,

14:16.647 --> 14:17.898
but we're building the wall.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.110
Fine. Abandon your morals.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.029
Build your dumb wall.
Appease your dumb guilt

14:24.113 --> 14:26.365
at firing your father
because of his dumb investment.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.118
It's not dumb. He's the only person
who ever believed in this company.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.829
Which isn't real, so that makes it dumb.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.206
You know what?
I don't even care anymore, though.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.250
It'll be you who's guilty of fraud.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.335
But, hey,
maybe you can get those dumb attorneys

14:38.419 --> 14:40.754
from that short Netflix show
that's not on the air anymore.

14:41.755 --> 14:42.840
[man] They canceled that?

<i>to get a lawyer herself...</i>

- Da.
- Da.

14:54.351 --> 14:57.354
Da! Oh, I knew you'd find out eventually.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.232
I mean, I haven't exactly been
in a courtroom for...

15:00.316 --> 15:02.067
For several years, I know.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.111
I wouldn't ask if I had other options.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.655
- Look, I don't want to take advantage...
- [sighs]

15:07.031 --> 15:10.284
...but your ex wants to make sure
my son can never truly be free

15:10.367 --> 15:13.037
in his life, and maybe you think
I'm an overbearing mother,

15:13.454 --> 15:15.956
but I will not let this DA take my job.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.876
I think you're a very caring mother.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.920
In fact, I'll go one step further.

15:21.003 --> 15:24.048
I think this is
how a mother's supposed to act.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.759
Oh, so she's not as sweet
as she seems, is she?

15:26.842 --> 15:27.927
Trust me, it's all an act.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.346
She's not even interested in children.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.890
Well, maybe, like, babies,

15:32.973 --> 15:34.767
but that's weird,
because who likes babies?

15:35.017 --> 15:37.269
Mm, especially in the early years, I know.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.063
Well, this is a way to expose her.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.315
I mean, she'll be so rattled,
she'll call for a mistrial

15:41.398 --> 15:43.859
before you're even finished
with your opening statement.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.112
Oh, boy, now I'm really tempted.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.990
Yeah. I ca... I can't wait to see her face

15:50.074 --> 15:51.992
when she learns
that you're the one I'm with now.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.036
Believe me, I even wanted to lie

15:54.119 --> 15:56.372
and tell her things had gotten sexual
with us, but...

15:56.455 --> 15:58.123
I didn't want to make things weird.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.627
You don't have to tell her about us.
I mean, I'm old enough to be your mother.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.171
Right.
That's why I chose the word "weird."

16:05.422 --> 16:08.342
But maybe that's why I've been eager
to move in with you.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.845
And I think maybe it's time
for that to happen.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.515
[Dusty] Then I'm in.
I will be your lawyer.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.184

16:17.267 --> 16:19.478
when I'm with a woman
who totally accepts me.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.607
I wouldn't change a thing, and of course,
you'll need to cut your hair.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.859
Oh, that'll make her totally crazy.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.861
Yeah. She could never get me to do that.

You know? I... I even had to use
my show business connections

17:12.781 --> 17:14.156
to get a film crew
to rent out the cottage

17:14.241 --> 17:15.992
for a couple of days.
You know, of course,

17:16.076 --> 17:18.287
- the real payment there was...

17:18.368 --> 17:19.997
Uh, no, not at all. No. The...

17:20.079 --> 17:22.374
And that was the real payment,
just to see her reaction

17:22.458 --> 17:25.044
to a boom operator standing
on her bed, it was worth it.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.755

[Michael] Uh, I guess I erased them.
Yeah, fine.

18:24.853 --> 18:27.314
Sure, we'll try it your way.
We'll do the Dusty mistrial thing.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.774

I... I think
that maybe we just cancel the event,

18:57.886 --> 18:59.138

[chuckles] No. We can't cancel the gig.

It's gonna be boring. I mean,

19:04.476 --> 19:06.186

We're gonna have press

- Do you really think so?

19:31.587 --> 19:32.462
[Gob] Yes!

19:32.546 --> 19:35.382
Except for a very few specific moments
where we need them to look away,

19:35.465 --> 19:37.384

Hey, what's the matter with you?

20:35.651 --> 20:37.903
Shouldn't you be working
on your opening statement?

20:37.986 --> 20:39.279
Ah, I hate it!

20:39.529 --> 20:42.324
I just wasted an hour and a half
working on an opening joke,

20:42.407 --> 20:45.035
till I realized
that it's from <i>Fast and Furious.</i>

It doesn't even work
unless you're in a Camaro.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.538
[Lucille]
Why are you worried about a joke?

20:48.622 --> 20:50.624
You just need an opening argument.

20:51.041 --> 20:54.419
Well, because my argument comes
right after I state,

20:54.503 --> 20:56.505
"If you think that's funny,
wait until you hear

20:56.588 --> 20:58.882
what the opening statement
the prosecution is gonna give."

20:59.549 --> 21:02.844
I thought the prosecution went first
and then the defense.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.264
Sorry, I forgot, you know everything.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.933
No, <i>I'm </i> sorry. I'm just anxious.

You're the mother of the defendant,

21:13.272 --> 21:15.274
I'm gonna be the one
everyone's staring at,

21:15.357 --> 21:17.985

who's gonna be judging me the most.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.445
- The judge can't show favoritism.
- No.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.948
- Lottie!
- [Lucille] Oh, that's ridiculous.

21:23.031 --> 21:26.285
Trust me, the moment
she sees you walk into that courtroom,

21:26.368 --> 21:27.703
the joke's going to be on <i>her!</i>

21:27.995 --> 21:30.247
Yeah! That's why I wanted
to tell the joke first!

21:39.172 --> 21:42.092
Ah. <i>You </i> calm down.
Stop telling me what to do.

Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be your mother,

21:44.303 --> 21:46.305
but... but I'm worried about my son.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.140
Okay. If you don't want to be my mother,

21:48.223 --> 21:51.059
then maybe stop referring to me
as your son, how about that?

21:51.935 --> 21:53.979
I... I'm talking about Buster.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.774
Yes!
You're always talking about Buster.

How are you gonna represent Buster?

22:00.736 --> 22:02.654
Have you talked to Buster today?
You know what?

- [sad piano music playing]
- That's right, keep walking, pal.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.989
[George Sr.] Jitters can be bad.
Remember when I had them

22:46.073 --> 22:47.908
the night before we went to trial

22:47.991 --> 22:50.952
- for that tax evasion in '88?
- [Lucille] Oh, yeah.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.997
- We had to hide all that boy fight money.
- [George Sr.] Yeah.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.583
You gave me
that "in case you're going away" present.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.460
That got the jitters out of me.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.421
What do you think about doing that
with Dusty?

23:03.840 --> 23:05.842
How can you ask me that?

23:05.926 --> 23:08.053
I just know how you can be.
There was a time

23:08.136 --> 23:10.055
right after Gob was born...

23:10.972 --> 23:14.267
when you grew cold
and contemptuous of everyone.

23:14.726 --> 23:15.644
You remember that?

23:15.727 --> 23:17.979
Well, only because it's still going on.

23:18.313 --> 23:20.357
Maybe I've pulled away from him.

23:21.191 --> 23:24.236
In fact, most nights he goes back home
to sleep in his own bed.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.863
Which is fine.
I... I want his head in his work.

23:27.197 --> 23:31.535
Huh. That doesn't necessarily mean
yours has to take the night off.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.286
Hey, I hate the idea,

23:33.370 --> 23:36.998
but we gotta do something to get
his confidence in that courtroom,

23:37.082 --> 23:40.127
and I am willing to shut my eyes
and let it happen.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.464
Now you know how I felt all those years,
George.

23:47.676 --> 23:51.888
[Ron] <i>But even though Lucille felt good</i>
<i>about making George feel bad,</i>

23:51.972 --> 23:53.473

<i>So that evening, she arrived at the home</i>

23:57.227 --> 23:59.479
<i>she felt Dusty had been driven back to</i>

23:59.563 --> 24:01.690
<i>by her lack of physical affection.</i>

24:01.773 --> 24:03.900
Someone will be with you
in just a moment.

24:04.317 --> 24:07.195
<i>Although it was considerably less modest
than she had imagined.</i>

24:07.279 --> 24:09.281
[piano music playing]

24:11.408 --> 24:13.118
- May I help you?
- I'm sorry.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.412
I thought this was
where Dustin Radler lived.

24:15.495 --> 24:17.330
Mr. Radler's in his bedroom.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.458
- I'll have to announce you.
- Announce me?

24:19.541 --> 24:21.418
- Carla, please!
- No, no. I...

24:21.501 --> 24:23.587
I was just going to casually drop by.

24:23.837 --> 24:27.174
- Carla, Miss...
- Bluth. Lucille Bluth.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.426
Yeah, is here for a casual drop-by.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.553
Why is this the first
I'm hearing about it?

24:31.636 --> 24:33.680
I'm sorry. I didn't...
Was the casual drop-by

24:33.763 --> 24:34.890
scheduled within the month?

24:34.973 --> 24:37.058
You don't need to ask that.
Just check all the way back

24:37.142 --> 24:39.227
- through May.
- May I be of assistance?

24:39.311 --> 24:40.937
[woman] Mrs. Bluth is here for a CDB,

24:41.021 --> 24:42.606
and Carla didn't know about it.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.317
Most likely
because it wasn't made into a Vine.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.318
[man] That's fine,

24:46.401 --> 24:48.695
I'm sure it was booked
through our second floor staff.

24:48.945 --> 24:51.448
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you were close to the Salazars.

24:51.531 --> 24:52.824
No, I didn't book...

24:53.283 --> 24:55.577
- Who are the Salazars?
- [man] The second floor staff.

24:55.660 --> 24:59.289
Mrs. Salazar was our pantry captain
for 15 years.

24:59.372 --> 25:01.875
[woman] Yes,
back when she was Ms. Bautista.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.711
Three guesses what she did
to get on two.

25:04.794 --> 25:07.255
[Lucille] No. You... You...
I'm just here to see Dusty.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.798
Uh, Mr. Radler.

25:08.882 --> 25:12.052
But, I... I... I'm sorry,
you all work for him?

25:12.135 --> 25:14.179
He never mentioned
that he had so much...

25:14.262 --> 25:16.765
[Ron]
<i>Lucille thought better of saying "money."</i>

25:16.848 --> 25:19.726
- ...of a staff here.
- [man] On the first floor?

25:20.268 --> 25:22.604
What, does he now think
the Salazars control everything?

25:22.687 --> 25:25.690
I told you!
The first floor used to mean something

25:25.774 --> 25:26.691
in this house.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.402
Jean, no.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.029
That pantry is unguarded.

25:31.488 --> 25:35.408
You must start keeping up that datebook.
Jean!

25:36.076 --> 25:39.329
[Ron] <i>Lucille could tell there was tension</i>
<i>among her boyfriend's staff,</i>

25:39.412 --> 25:41.331
<i>and she felt compelled to say...</i>

25:41.414 --> 25:43.750
How rich is this sand hobo?

25:43.833 --> 25:45.585
[Ron] <i>Well, yeah, she did say that.</i>

25:45.669 --> 25:48.255
<i>But about the staff, she also said...</i>

[Ron] <i>Oh, ap-</i>- <i>apologies.</i>

25:51.550 --> 25:54.761

Why the...

- "My daughter Annette."
- [Tobias] The... Uh, or...

26:16.116 --> 26:18.660
I wouldn't have voted that way,
is what I meant to say.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.746
- Should we read the last one?
- [Maeby] No.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.291
Because it's just gonna say <i>my </i> name.

26:24.541 --> 26:28.128
I voted myself out, too, okay?
'Cause I can't take it anymore.

26:28.211 --> 26:31.089
You've taken all the fun
out of the worst part of life.
