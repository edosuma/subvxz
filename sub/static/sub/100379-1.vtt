00:11.112 --> 00:13.512
(gentle music)

00:29.697 --> 00:31.497
- The old men of Tarpon Springs

00:31.499 --> 00:34.233
say the boy who gets the
cross at the Epiphany ceremony

00:34.235 --> 00:36.268
is forever changed.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.605
He is enlightened,
closer to his faith,

00:39.607 --> 00:41.240
and brings luck to his family.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.044
Ultimately, unity will
come to that family.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.414
Unity will come.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.484
Can I play?

00:56.257 --> 00:57.156
- Solitaire.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.793
(gentle music)

01:15.342 --> 01:17.309
- [Man On Radio] Good
morning, Tarpon Springs.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.610
Got some flowing
sunshine for us today

01:18.612 --> 01:21.080
with a high of 80 degrees.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.649
Not so bad for it's
almost Christmas time.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.617
Let's hope today's
weather sticks around...

01:25.619 --> 01:27.352
Are preparing to
dive for the cross...

01:27.354 --> 01:30.122
Epiphany Celebration next week.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.559
(gentle music)

01:37.731 --> 01:40.299
(air blowing)

01:43.471 --> 01:45.104
- It stinks, right?

01:46.140 --> 01:47.239
- No, it's fine.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.409
- You're gonna have
to get used to it

01:50.411 --> 01:52.244
if you keep coming out with us.

01:55.850 --> 01:58.450
(gentle music)

02:19.273 --> 02:20.506
- Graveyard down there.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.679
- This should be the sweet spot.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.348
We'll go out to another
area one more time.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.216
- I'm telling you, there's
nothing down there.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.317
- There's not enough!

02:41.395 --> 02:43.829
- [Luka] I was told by
my aunt that my father

02:43.831 --> 02:46.698
tried several times to
get the cross as a boy.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.467
He tried for that unity,

02:48.469 --> 02:51.170
but it never came to him.

02:51.172 --> 02:51.670
To us.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.616
- Shake it up, I
need the big ones.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.351
How many times I
have to tell you?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.868
(birds squawking)

03:32.313 --> 03:33.412
- Hey, Peter!

03:35.249 --> 03:37.316
Uncle Peter, I think
this boat is coming.

03:38.752 --> 03:39.651
Hey!

03:41.789 --> 03:42.988
Hey!

03:42.990 --> 03:43.956
You're gonna go over the hose!

03:43.958 --> 03:44.856
Stop!

03:55.769 --> 03:57.603
(gasping)

03:57.605 --> 03:59.438
- What the hell?

03:59.440 --> 04:00.505
- [Luka] I'm sorry.

04:00.507 --> 04:02.507
- What, are you trying
to kill me down there?

04:02.509 --> 04:04.009
- No, a boat came close...

04:04.011 --> 04:05.544
- What are you doing?

04:05.546 --> 04:06.445
Wake up!

04:06.447 --> 04:08.614
(yelling)

04:09.650 --> 04:10.449
Why didn't you wake him up?

04:10.451 --> 04:11.383
- [Luka] I tried!

04:11.385 --> 04:12.751
- They cut my air off.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.553
- [Luka] It came close
and I was yelling

04:14.555 --> 04:15.587
and it just stopped
and it was...

04:15.589 --> 04:17.623
- I almost died down there!

04:17.625 --> 04:18.523
Oh my God.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.462
Gimme that.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.800
(dramatic music)

04:33.974 --> 04:34.906
- [Man] Damn it.

04:34.908 --> 04:35.841
- [Luka] What's he doing?

04:35.843 --> 04:37.609
- He came up too fast,

04:37.611 --> 04:38.543
now he's trying to go down
and come up the right way

04:38.545 --> 04:39.611
with the proper stuff.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.487
(gentle music)

05:28.062 --> 05:30.529
(speaking in foreign language)

05:30.531 --> 05:31.530
- No, no, these are
good, look at these.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.597
- I'll be lookin'.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.566
(speaking in foreign language)

05:34.568 --> 05:35.600
- Come on, Bill.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.935
What are you talking about?

05:36.937 --> 05:38.103
They're perfect
sponges, they're good.

05:38.105 --> 05:42.074
(speaking in foreign language)

05:42.076 --> 05:43.608
(speaking in foreign language)

05:43.610 --> 05:45.544
(speaking in foreign language)

05:45.546 --> 05:47.813
- Fellas, take it.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.715
I come back later
pick up the sponges.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.116
- [Man] See you guys later.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.355
(dramatic music)

05:58.859 --> 06:00.592
- [Theo] Hey.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.493
Look at you.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.028
- Ooh, look at me.

06:03.030 --> 06:03.862
Look at you.

06:03.863 --> 06:04.695
- [Theo] All dressed up.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.633
Come on, let's get out of here.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.154
- [Woman] What's this?

06:30.657 --> 06:31.556
- That's mine.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.592
- [Woman] Whoa.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.460
- That's private.

06:35.462 --> 06:38.063
(gentle music)

07:05.159 --> 07:07.692
- Have you been
doing your prayers?

07:07.694 --> 07:08.794
- Yeah.

07:09.797 --> 07:10.629
- They're very important.

07:12.466 --> 07:15.033
Do you think that things will
be different now she's gone?

07:23.143 --> 07:24.810
Come on get ready, we're late.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.046
- Do I have to go?

07:28.048 --> 07:30.549
I said I was sorry like
a billion times already.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.817
- The Father needs your help.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.153
- You mean it's my punishment.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.656
- Get going.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.228
(gentle music)

08:59.006 --> 09:00.739
- [Priest] That
one's Saint Paul.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.077
- He doesn't look
like he belongs.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.146
- Once a persecutor
of Christians.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.551
Then he brought us
the words of Jesus.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.753
- Bad man that became good?

09:16.123 --> 09:17.122
- We can all change.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.194
Luka, do you know
why you're here?

09:24.932 --> 09:26.932
- Because I took the
youth group money.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.067
- And why did you take it?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.302
- I don't know.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.238
(sighs)

09:33.240 --> 09:35.574
- Our ministry at
Sunshine needs volunteers.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.176
I would like for you to
put some hours in there.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.945
- I wanna be an altar girl.

09:41.315 --> 09:44.649
- There are traditions
in the church.

09:44.651 --> 09:45.216
You can't.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.251
- Why not?

09:46.253 --> 09:48.887
Because it's just for boys?

09:50.958 --> 09:55.827
- Luka, it's okay to still
be sad about your Aunt Maria.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.629
- I'm fine.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.965
- I can't help you
unless you let me.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.372
- Do you know anything
about my father?

10:08.875 --> 10:13.778
- Your father and uncle
came a long time ago,

10:15.115 --> 10:18.650
during a difficult
time on their island.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.052
Talk to him.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.642
(dramatic music)

11:09.302 --> 11:11.836
(lively music)

11:18.078 --> 11:18.910
- Hi.
- Whatcha doin'?

11:18.912 --> 11:19.744
- Not much.

11:19.746 --> 11:20.679
Hey.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.946
- How's your brother?

11:21.948 --> 11:23.448
- He's good, he's
washing the boat today.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.382
- Oh yeah?

11:24.384 --> 11:25.150
You guys out all week?

11:25.152 --> 11:26.217
- Yeah, two.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.719
Just got back in this morning.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.887
- Anything good?

11:28.889 --> 11:29.788
- Nah.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.323
- You stayin'?

11:32.325 --> 11:33.158
- He can't.

11:33.160 --> 11:33.992
- Come on!

11:33.994 --> 11:34.893
He's a big boy.

11:36.063 --> 11:40.865
- No, I'm in.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.902
- You know, if anything
goes missing around here

11:43.904 --> 11:46.271
I'm gonna know who to look for.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.306
- Well, he said I had
to put in an hour, so.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.183
- Why don't you go find
a patient to read to?

11:58.185 --> 11:59.250
All right, they love it.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.457
(gentle music)

12:07.160 --> 12:09.260
- Ooh, girl, I don't think
you wanna be doin' that.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.496
We call that one right
there Crab Apple.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.073
- Well.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.076
What do we got here?

12:26.880 --> 12:29.514
Listen, young lady, I'm not
a baby that you have to read

12:29.516 --> 12:31.182
to put to sleep.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.184
I don't need those
stories, okay?

12:33.186 --> 12:35.053
- You got something better?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.489
- What did you do, little
girl, to get yourself in here?

12:37.491 --> 12:39.758
Somethin' pretty bad I bet.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.827
- You sure got a lot of stuff.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.395
- Yes, a lifetime.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.772
- Who is that woman?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.207
- That's my wife.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.375
- She's pretty.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.376
(laughs)

12:58.378 --> 12:59.244
- Yes.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.882
What are you readin', honey?

13:06.052 --> 13:07.852
A lot of words.

13:07.854 --> 13:09.053
You see this on my arm?

13:10.390 --> 13:13.424
You won't find a story
like that in here.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.128
(gentle music)

13:34.347 --> 13:36.247
- [Player] How's Luka?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.516
- She's okay, she's good.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.886
- Even with Maria gone?

13:41.888 --> 13:43.822
- You know, Peter's
taking care of it.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.192
She's still better off.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.092
- I see.

13:48.929 --> 13:49.828
First.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.239
(speaking in foreign language)

14:01.241 --> 14:04.275
(speaking in foreign language)

14:04.277 --> 14:05.977
- Come on.

14:05.979 --> 14:06.878
- [Theo] What are
you doin' here?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.112
- Look, it's time to go.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.882
- Luka, go home.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.084
- But you shouldn't be here.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.118
- Theo, maybe you should just...

14:14.120 --> 14:15.320
- Get the hell out of here!

14:29.336 --> 14:30.435
- Peter.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.471
You haven't returned
any of my calls.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.541
Will you take a
seat for a minute?

14:46.419 --> 14:49.153
We remortgaged your
house in 2012, right?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.022
- Yeah.

14:52.525 --> 14:57.061
- Okay, well, moving
forward, what can we do here?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.415
- You don't look so good, man.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.918
- I'm good, I'm good.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.587
- Maybe we take a
break, eh, guys?

15:22.589 --> 15:23.988
- [Man] Game's almost over.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.089
- I got this.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.127
(exhales deeply)

15:29.129 --> 15:31.529
- Just take a minute.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.097
- Okay, fine fine.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.672
(heavy breathing)

16:03.964 --> 16:06.998
(body thudding)

16:07.000 --> 16:09.567
(dramatic music)

17:21.741 --> 17:23.674
- Oh, you're awake.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.042
Do you know where you are?

17:26.179 --> 17:27.078
- Yeah.

17:27.781 --> 17:30.548
How long I been here for?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.083
- Well, you have
decompression sickness.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.118
You were leveling out
for the last five hours

17:34.120 --> 17:35.586
in that chamber there.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.655
May I?

17:38.558 --> 17:39.657
- Yeah, sure.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.194
- Okay.

17:47.834 --> 17:48.666
- Are we done here?

17:48.668 --> 17:50.701
- No, no, whoa.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.370
Your body just
experienced major trauma.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.438
You need to rest.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.376
- I don't have time to rest.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.310
Or money for that matter.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.612
- Well, I hate to disappoint,

18:01.614 --> 18:03.815
but the admin woman will
be back around later

18:03.817 --> 18:05.083
to get your information.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.651
- Yeah, I'm sure she will be.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.788
- Your brother said it
was a diving accident.

18:10.790 --> 18:11.789
- Oh, is that what he said?

18:13.293 --> 18:15.193
- And your daughter
was here earlier.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.528
- Is she still here?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.466
- No, I gave her a progress
report and sent her home.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.366
Relax.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.242
So what were you diving for?

18:33.780 --> 18:34.846
- Just mermaids.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.184
- Sponge diver in Tarpon?

18:40.186 --> 18:41.886
- Yeah, you been there?

18:41.888 --> 18:43.321
- A few times.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.789
I go to the Epiphany every year.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.124
- Oh.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.625
'Cause nothing says you love God

18:47.627 --> 18:49.427
more than an Archbishop
throwing a giant cross

18:49.429 --> 18:50.795
in the water, right?

18:50.797 --> 18:54.198
- Yeah, well, they throw
a good party afterwards.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.734
(phone ringing)

18:57.537 --> 18:58.636
Hello.

19:04.911 --> 19:05.743
- Who won the game?

19:09.415 --> 19:10.481
- I spoke to Alex.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.684
- About what?

19:13.686 --> 19:14.919
- A job for you at Clearwater.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.356
- Painting.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.758
You're kidding me, right?

19:22.262 --> 19:23.861
- Look, I don't wanna do
this anymore with you.

19:23.863 --> 19:24.829
- What?

19:25.565 --> 19:26.797
- I'm tired.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.801
Look, I had your back,
brother, for a long time.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.542
- You can't let me
go, and you know it.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.376
Who's gonna dive?

19:38.378 --> 19:39.277
You?

19:40.313 --> 19:41.746
- I'll manage.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.381
- And you're kicking
me out for what, huh?

19:43.383 --> 19:44.649
- We needed that
money for the business

19:44.651 --> 19:45.850
and you pissed it away.

19:45.852 --> 19:46.884
Like you always do.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.419
- If I had more time in the game

19:48.421 --> 19:49.253
I would have doubled
our money for us.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.655
- Enough!

19:50.657 --> 19:53.324
It's the same line
over and over.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.727
I can't keep carrying you.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.199
- Yeah, you got
my back, brother.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.242
- Hey.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.978
Don't just stand
there, Robin Hood.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.246
Come on, baby, come here.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.723
Say something to me, please.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.828
- I know you don't
want me to read to you.

20:30.830 --> 20:31.662
- No.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.930
- So, can I play?

20:32.932 --> 20:33.831
- Sure, baby.

20:36.703 --> 20:37.668
- Can I have some?

20:38.738 --> 20:39.770
- No.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.808
Take a smell of it, it's awful.

20:43.810 --> 20:47.245
It's for old geezers
and medical people.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.515
(groans)

20:56.356 --> 20:58.556
- [Luka] Did you love your wife?

20:58.558 --> 20:59.924
- Yes, I did.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.393
The days before the invasion,

21:04.664 --> 21:08.499
she and me were very happy.

21:08.501 --> 21:11.535
She would dance around
and sing around my house.

21:11.537 --> 21:12.703
- What invasion?

21:12.705 --> 21:14.972
- Turkey invaded my island.

21:14.974 --> 21:15.973
- Oh.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.008
- Cyprus.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.342
- I know it.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.510
My father's from there.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.380
So you had two sons.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.386
- You've been listening, huh?

21:29.355 --> 21:30.588
- Are you rich?

21:30.590 --> 21:32.757
- Why are you askin'?

21:32.759 --> 21:35.559
You plan to take all my money?

21:35.561 --> 21:37.662
(laughs)

21:38.765 --> 21:40.498
Too bad for you.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
I just was a poor fisherman.

21:52.011 --> 21:52.843
What do you got?

21:54.514 --> 21:55.379
- Spades.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.815
- I got three aces.

21:59.385 --> 22:00.518
(laughs)

22:00.520 --> 22:01.519
No I don't.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.905
(dramatic music)

23:31.677 --> 23:34.044
- She told you Lenny went
to Colimos early, right?

23:37.850 --> 23:39.850
You got all your stuff,
you got your toothbrush?

23:41.821 --> 23:42.753
See you in a week.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.772
(dramatic music)

24:33.673 --> 24:35.039
- Hey.

24:35.041 --> 24:35.906
(speaks foreign language)

24:35.908 --> 24:36.807
Get to work.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.104
- Can I help?

25:08.941 --> 25:09.974
- Sure, do whatever.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.814
(birds squawking)

25:16.816 --> 25:17.948
- Where'd you get her?

25:19.018 --> 25:20.618
- I won her in a game of cards.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.294
- Can we take her
out eventually?

25:31.597 --> 25:32.596
- [Theo] Doesn't have a motor.

25:32.598 --> 25:33.297
- Too much money?

25:34.734 --> 25:36.300
- Yeah, you catch
on pretty quick.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.937
I already got a little stash
put aside, just need some more.

25:41.274 --> 25:43.974
- Okay, well, where did
you get the other money.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.242
Maybe you can just...

25:45.244 --> 25:46.644
- This is my quiet
time now, okay?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.246
- Okay, got it.

25:51.584 --> 25:54.184
(dramatic music)

27:31.117 --> 27:34.118
- Hey, don't touch
my stuff again, okay?

27:35.721 --> 27:36.987
- I just wanted to try it on.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.924
- Oh what, you're wearing
berets in your hair now?

27:41.961 --> 27:42.860
- Why not?

27:42.862 --> 27:43.694
- I don't know.

27:43.696 --> 27:44.795
Wear berets.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.331
- Whose is that?

27:47.333 --> 27:48.666
- What?

27:48.668 --> 27:49.967
- Did that belong to my mother?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.169
- Your grandmother.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.071
- [Luka] Will you
tell me about here?

27:54.073 --> 27:54.938
- Not right now.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.880
- Why don't I live
here with you?

28:04.917 --> 28:05.883
- It's a small place.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.285
- You could get
something bigger.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.119
- Not that easy.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.923
- [Luka] I'm sure you
could work it out.

28:12.925 --> 28:13.957
- It's more money.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.727
- So if we had more money?

28:18.230 --> 28:19.730
- No.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.332
(dramatic music)

28:39.051 --> 28:41.318
- And, by the way, I'm
allergic to strawberries.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.862
(door closing)

29:01.307 --> 29:02.306
- Hey.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.807
- Hey.

29:03.809 --> 29:04.374
How was the trip?

29:05.244 --> 29:06.977
- It was all right.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.278
(horn beeping)

29:08.280 --> 29:10.013
- [Man] A short
stop, it's Epiphany.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.315
- I wanna dive at the Epiphany.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.118
- You know it's just for boys.

29:20.025 --> 29:21.125
- I wish I'd been born a boy.

29:21.127 --> 29:22.893
You know, maybe then...

29:22.895 --> 29:24.328
- Then what?

29:24.330 --> 29:25.295
- You could have a
chance at good luck.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.366
- Yeah, well, God knows
this family needs it.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.141
- [Man] Forgetting
what is behind

29:37.143 --> 29:41.111
and straining toward
what is ahead.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.082
I press on toward the
goal to win the prize

29:45.084 --> 29:49.820
for which God has called me
heavenward in Christ Jesus.

29:51.090 --> 29:54.958
A special blessing
to these young men

29:54.960 --> 29:57.928
who have readied
themselves through prayer

29:57.930 --> 30:00.330
and proper preparation

30:00.332 --> 30:03.934
to retrieve the
victorious symbol

30:03.936 --> 30:08.172
of your most precious
and life giving cross

30:08.174 --> 30:09.206
from these waters.

30:10.943 --> 30:14.978
Guide them always that they
may prove to be worthy examples

30:16.048 --> 30:19.216
to their peers, their families,

30:19.218 --> 30:22.486
and to all members
of this community.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.389
Through the faith they
demonstrate to you

30:25.391 --> 30:28.425
and through the
love now and ever,

30:28.427 --> 30:30.527
and unto the ages of ages.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.096
Amen.

30:33.098 --> 30:34.832
Young men strong.

30:34.834 --> 30:39.503
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

30:43.375 --> 30:46.276
(uplifting music)

30:56.088 --> 30:58.155
We pray to you, O lovely Lord,

30:59.391 --> 31:02.993
to bless this, our
annual gathering

31:02.995 --> 31:07.464
to commemorate your holy
baptism in the River Jordan,

31:07.466 --> 31:10.901
today, the day of the Epiphany.

31:13.239 --> 31:16.139
(uplifting music)

31:28.587 --> 31:33.457
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

32:14.533 --> 32:16.400
- What the hell do you
think you were doing?

32:16.402 --> 32:17.301
Huh?

32:19.438 --> 32:21.171
Cover yourself.

32:21.173 --> 32:22.072
- Peter.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.242
Take it easy, huh?

32:28.547 --> 32:30.547
- Why shouldn't our
family have a chance?

32:37.356 --> 32:39.990
(lively music)

32:50.536 --> 32:54.438
(singing in foreign language)

32:59.211 --> 32:59.977
Can I have some money?

33:08.287 --> 33:09.252
(speaking in foreign language)

33:09.254 --> 33:11.321
- Hey, leave her alone.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.489
She's been through a lot
with Maria's passing.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.691
- You're a good man, Peter.

33:14.693 --> 33:15.592
To your brother.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.097
- I've got nothing
to be proud of.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.565
Nothing to show for
all these years.

33:24.770 --> 33:25.569
- Could have had more

33:27.039 --> 33:28.739
if you weren't
carrying someone else.

33:28.741 --> 33:29.740
- It wasn't just him.

33:29.742 --> 33:31.375
I had expenses with Maria.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.478
What we have we earned together.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.047
- There's room for you
at the painting job too.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.218
(speaking in foreign language)

33:41.220 --> 33:45.188
(speaking in foreign language)

33:47.726 --> 33:50.560
(lively music)

33:54.600 --> 33:56.099
- To our health, to our health.

33:56.101 --> 33:57.434
- [Cari] Yes.

33:57.436 --> 33:58.301
- Do you know what
you're doing there?

33:58.303 --> 33:59.636
- I can handle it.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.238
- Had a lot of ouzo
in your lifetime?

34:04.643 --> 34:05.742
- Oh.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.079
Bartender, another please.

34:09.081 --> 34:09.713
- Make that two.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.717
- So you find any
mermaids lately?

34:16.722 --> 34:17.821
- Oh.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.223
You.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.427
Well, well, well.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.799
(speaking in foreign language)

34:28.801 --> 34:29.699
- Cheers.

34:33.672 --> 34:34.571
Yeah.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.572
Handled it.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.442
- [Theo] How bad?

34:38.444 --> 34:42.344
(singing in foreign language)

35:24.790 --> 35:27.157
- [Cari] Where'd you learn
how to dance like that?

35:27.159 --> 35:28.258
- I don't know.

35:28.260 --> 35:28.758
I guess it's in the bones.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.400
Like a swaying tree.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.574
It's the drunken
dance, the blues dance.

35:45.577 --> 35:46.776
- Drunken dance?

35:51.517 --> 35:53.917
(chuckling)

35:55.387 --> 35:56.586
You're staring at me.

35:57.623 --> 35:58.522
I did it wrong.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.257
- No, you did good.

36:00.259 --> 36:00.924
You did it real good.

36:04.396 --> 36:05.595
- Oh hi.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.297
- [Woman] Hi.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.933
- Oh, I like these.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.869
- My mom used to collect sand
dollars when I was a kid.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.372
You know...

36:15.374 --> 36:16.773
Thank you.

36:16.775 --> 36:17.941
One side is like a flower.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.645
Legend has it that
doves live inside,

36:21.647 --> 36:22.946
and if you crack it open

36:22.948 --> 36:24.648
you're spreading
peace and goodwill.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.518
Here.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.553
- Whoa, I've never
heard that story.

36:29.555 --> 36:30.387
I like that.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.191
Oh my God, it's
like a little dove.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.194
That's so beautiful.

36:37.196 --> 36:37.694
- Yeah, it is.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.265
- Well, thank you.

36:42.267 --> 36:43.567
- Thanks.

36:43.569 --> 36:44.401
- [Woman] You're welcome.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.302
I...

36:46.672 --> 36:48.271
I'm on call really
early in the morning,

36:48.273 --> 36:50.207
so I have to go.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.378
(gentle music)

37:03.789 --> 37:05.722
- Why don't you stay a
little bit longer, huh?

37:05.724 --> 37:06.823
Please.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.493
I don't know anything about you.

37:13.265 --> 37:14.998
- Maybe just a little bit.

37:23.308 --> 37:24.975
- But you never know.
- I can't do it.

37:24.977 --> 37:27.611
- [Theo] You just never know.

37:27.613 --> 37:30.380
(dramatic music)

37:40.959 --> 37:41.858
- Did you fix it?

37:41.860 --> 37:42.826
- That should do it.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.633
(birds squawking)

37:49.635 --> 37:50.533
Here's your bill.

37:57.576 --> 37:58.642
- [Luka] I could do it.

37:59.878 --> 38:00.844
- Do what?

38:01.880 --> 38:03.647
- [Luka] Help you on the boat.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.017
- What do you know about it?

38:07.019 --> 38:08.918
- A lot, I've been watching
these last two months.

38:08.920 --> 38:09.819
I'm learning.

38:09.821 --> 38:10.553
- No.

38:10.555 --> 38:11.888
- Why not?

38:11.890 --> 38:13.723
Just let me pick up
the slack for him.

38:13.725 --> 38:14.591
I can help you.

38:14.593 --> 38:15.792
- I said no.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.795
(dramatic music)

38:32.544 --> 38:34.811
- You're a local celebrity.

38:35.847 --> 38:36.946
- Yeah.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.417
- You look sad.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.985
- Well, it was only a couple
months after we arrived here.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.920
I didn't really
wanna be here, so.

38:45.691 --> 38:46.723
- Where in Greece are you from?

38:46.725 --> 38:47.924
- Not Greece, Cyprus.

38:48.627 --> 38:49.492
Close.

38:49.494 --> 38:50.427
- I've been there.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.028
- Really, where about?

38:52.030 --> 38:55.365
- All over, but my favorite
spot was Aphrodite's rock.

38:55.367 --> 38:56.566
- Oh.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.001
Petra tou Romiou.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.102
Birthplace of Aphrodite.

39:00.372 --> 39:01.771
Beautiful, huh.
- So beautiful.

39:01.773 --> 39:02.672
Do you miss it?

39:03.909 --> 39:05.008
- Yeah.

39:09.548 --> 39:10.380
Oh hey.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.682
Look at this.

39:12.684 --> 39:13.983
This would be
perfect for you, huh?

39:13.985 --> 39:14.918
Look at that.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.553
- Mine are better.

39:16.555 --> 39:17.620
- You think so?

39:17.622 --> 39:19.456
- Yeah.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.958
This must be perfect
for Luka, huh?

39:21.960 --> 39:24.027
- Well, you know she's
kind of a different kid,

39:24.029 --> 39:26.596
so you never know.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.698
- Different in what way?

39:28.700 --> 39:32.802
- I don't know, she gets
in trouble at school.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.538
- Rebel.

39:35.540 --> 39:36.906
- Yeah, you could say that.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.776
Although I have no idea
where she gets it from.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.746
But, yeah she got
caught stealing

39:42.748 --> 39:43.813
a couple months ago.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.516
- Maybe she needs attention.

39:46.518 --> 39:47.884
- Or boarding school.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.886
I don't know, I'm
just not that person.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.493
- Oh, Luka, we're
going on a tour boat.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.527
You gonna come with us?

39:58.930 --> 40:00.029
- Should I?

40:01.933 --> 40:02.832
- Why not?

40:04.469 --> 40:06.503
- [Man] Anybody wanna
go sponge boat ride,

40:06.505 --> 40:08.438
we're leaving now.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.673
- [Tour Guide] We've
been doing this tour here

40:10.675 --> 40:12.142
simply because the
Greeks starting doing it

40:12.144 --> 40:13.543
over a thousand years ago.
- What's your name?

40:13.545 --> 40:15.011
- And the reason we do it is

40:15.013 --> 40:17.714
there's a very large
market still for sponges.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.549
Now what our early
sponge divers were after

40:19.551 --> 40:21.885
is this product right
here, the natural sponge,

40:21.887 --> 40:24.487
that we usually harvest
in this type of suit.

40:24.489 --> 40:25.922
The suit is made out of
two layers of canvas,

40:25.924 --> 40:27.457
one layer of rubber.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.726
It is water tight, it's
skin tight sometimes,

40:29.728 --> 40:32.462
cutting off the circulation.

40:32.464 --> 40:35.098
(gentle music)

41:02.994 --> 41:04.994
- [Crab Apple]
Hello, Robin Hood.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.162
- Crab Apple.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.031
(laughs)

41:08.033 --> 41:09.232
- How long you been there?

41:10.001 --> 41:11.534
- Few minutes.

41:11.536 --> 41:13.136
- This place is a hole.

41:13.138 --> 41:16.105
They bring ya the
worst food, ya know?

41:16.107 --> 41:20.510
On top of that, no one
visits me except my good son.

41:20.512 --> 41:23.580
Only the strong
survives, not the weak.

41:27.219 --> 41:28.651
Where did you get that?

41:29.788 --> 41:31.488
- Oh, it's my father's.

41:32.524 --> 41:33.957
- What's your father's name?

41:35.026 --> 41:35.925
- Theo.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.271
- Here.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.673
Go on, take that, please.

41:53.578 --> 41:55.645
- It's not mine.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.714
- Which one are you?

41:57.716 --> 41:59.516
The strong or the weak?

42:05.056 --> 42:07.056
You should go, I'm tired now.

42:11.062 --> 42:11.961
- Bye.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.032
(dramatic music)

44:07.178 --> 44:08.778
I wanna learn how to carve.

44:10.415 --> 44:11.681
- I'm not a very good teacher.

44:32.404 --> 44:33.302
Here.

44:44.349 --> 44:45.248
You try.

44:49.921 --> 44:50.987
- Like this?

44:52.257 --> 44:54.223
- Yeah, watch yourself.

45:01.066 --> 45:01.964
- [Luka] Cool.

45:12.811 --> 45:15.078
(groaning)

45:30.095 --> 45:30.993
Hey Bobby.

45:33.398 --> 45:34.864
You looking for work?

45:36.868 --> 45:38.101
- What is it?

45:38.103 --> 45:39.736
- Two weeks starting tomorrow.

45:40.271 --> 45:41.370
- With you?

45:42.841 --> 45:44.207
No, I'm good.

45:46.244 --> 45:48.311
- [Peter] Hey, you
guys looking for work?

45:55.987 --> 45:57.987
- [Luka] Is Cyprus
like Tarpon Springs?

46:00.258 --> 46:02.058
- [Theo] No, it's green here.

46:02.060 --> 46:05.461
Island is arid and blue.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.065
- What was my grandfather like?

46:14.472 --> 46:15.371
- He'd dead.

46:18.843 --> 46:20.409
He had to go off
to fight in a war.

46:23.848 --> 46:25.848
So, you know, he wasn't
around very much.

46:25.850 --> 46:26.849
When he was...

46:28.353 --> 46:29.252
- What?

46:31.389 --> 46:35.558
- Well, let's just say he
wasn't a very nice person.

46:37.328 --> 46:38.327
- What do you mean?

46:44.302 --> 46:46.469
- I can still hear the
sound of his belt snappin'.

46:52.443 --> 46:53.476
- Hey.

46:53.478 --> 46:54.577
- Oh, hi.

46:56.347 --> 46:57.580
What are you doing here?

46:57.582 --> 46:59.415
- [Cari] We said seven, right?

46:59.417 --> 47:00.917
- I thought we said tomorrow.

47:02.020 --> 47:02.952
- Is this a thing?

47:05.056 --> 47:06.489
- Sorry, Luka, I'll go.

47:09.527 --> 47:13.462
So sorry, I thought
it was tonight.

47:13.464 --> 47:15.298
- It's fine, come on.

47:16.201 --> 47:19.001
(dramatic music)

47:25.443 --> 47:26.542
- [Peter] What are
you doing in here?

47:28.279 --> 47:29.912
- Nothing.

47:29.914 --> 47:31.113
- I don't want you in here.

47:31.115 --> 47:32.515
- I was just laying here.

47:32.517 --> 47:34.283
- Well, never mind,
get ready for school.

47:35.520 --> 47:36.986
- I really miss her.

47:37.522 --> 47:40.523
(dramatic music)

47:42.527 --> 47:44.160
- I know.

47:44.162 --> 47:45.862
- I think about her everyday.

47:48.066 --> 47:48.965
Can I have this?

47:50.568 --> 47:52.368
- I don't want her stuff
moved around in here.

47:52.370 --> 47:53.569
- She would have
wanted me to have it.

47:53.571 --> 47:55.338
She wore it all the time.

47:55.340 --> 47:56.906
- Yeah, I know.

47:56.908 --> 48:00.409
I bought it for her when
things were going well.

48:27.538 --> 48:28.304
- Oh hey.

48:29.607 --> 48:32.208
- I can go, I just...
- No, no no, no.

48:32.210 --> 48:33.442
Come on in.

48:33.444 --> 48:34.377
- Are you staying?

48:35.413 --> 48:36.612
- What do you mean?

48:37.582 --> 48:38.681
- Never mind.

48:40.018 --> 48:41.284
- Is everything okay?

48:42.387 --> 48:43.920
- Tomorrow's my birthday.

48:43.922 --> 48:45.221
- Happy early birthday.

48:45.223 --> 48:46.622
- Thanks.

48:46.624 --> 48:49.058
I'm not sure if anyone
here even remembers.

48:49.060 --> 48:50.693
- Well, now I know.

48:51.496 --> 48:52.395
Are you hungry?

48:54.966 --> 48:56.432
- [Luka] The Crema's too thin.

48:56.434 --> 48:57.466
- Oh.

48:57.468 --> 48:58.567
- [Luka] It needs to be thicker.

48:58.569 --> 48:59.468
- Okay.

49:01.472 --> 49:03.639
So did your Dad teach
you how to do this?

49:03.641 --> 49:06.309
- No, my Aunt Maria, actually.

49:07.145 --> 49:08.244
- Oh.

49:09.714 --> 49:11.180
What happened to her?

49:12.617 --> 49:14.050
- She had breast cancer.

49:15.486 --> 49:16.552
- I'm sorry.

49:16.554 --> 49:20.122
- What good are they
if they make you die?

49:20.124 --> 49:24.627
- Well, you may feel
differently when you get older.

49:24.629 --> 49:27.129
- You know, she and I
would always stay up late,

49:27.131 --> 49:28.631
and she would read to me.

49:28.633 --> 49:31.200
She called me her
little lagoonie.

49:31.202 --> 49:33.035
It means my sweet.

49:33.037 --> 49:34.603
- Oh, I like that.

49:34.605 --> 49:36.238
You know, Luka's a
really good name too.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.273
- My real name's Lucas.

49:38.509 --> 49:40.009
They thought I was
gonna be a boy.

49:40.011 --> 49:42.211
- My parents said I
was gonna be a boy too.

49:42.213 --> 49:43.612
Yeah, it was something about

49:43.614 --> 49:45.448
the way my mother
was carrying me.

49:45.450 --> 49:46.649
I've never had a
child of my own,

49:46.651 --> 49:48.551
so I don't know that personally.

49:48.553 --> 49:49.452
- Why not?

49:50.388 --> 49:51.487
- I can't.

49:53.424 --> 49:54.323
I did try.

49:56.361 --> 49:57.526
- I'm sorry.

49:57.528 --> 49:58.627
- No, that's okay.

50:00.298 --> 50:01.764
How's that lookin'?

50:01.766 --> 50:02.598
- Pretty good.

50:04.168 --> 50:06.035
Pretty nice job for
your first try though.

50:06.037 --> 50:07.670
- You're a pro.

50:09.374 --> 50:10.606
- Had a lot of practice.

50:13.711 --> 50:15.611
(dramatic music)

50:15.613 --> 50:18.614
(doorbell chiming)

50:20.451 --> 50:21.784
- Hey.

50:21.786 --> 50:22.618
Where is she?

50:23.521 --> 50:24.720
- [Theo] In the bathroom.

50:24.722 --> 50:26.222
- Before you guys got here

50:26.224 --> 50:29.058
she was acting crazy
and biting my head off.

50:30.128 --> 50:31.093
- Did you talk to her?

50:32.430 --> 50:34.163
- Well, I don't know
what to say to her.

50:34.165 --> 50:35.398
- Same old story.

50:39.137 --> 50:40.069
(knocking)

50:40.071 --> 50:41.470
- Hey Luka, it's Cari.

50:44.742 --> 50:45.641
Wanna open up?

50:47.245 --> 50:48.411
Can I come in?

50:52.717 --> 50:53.716
Hey.

50:54.786 --> 50:56.552
What's goin' on, birthday girl?

51:01.225 --> 51:02.558
I saw your Dad got
you a birthday cake.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.093
- Yeah, Peter got it.

51:05.563 --> 51:09.799
And he also got me a
stupid dress for the dance.

51:09.801 --> 51:13.302
He just kept saying, "It would
have made Maria so happy.

51:13.304 --> 51:14.603
"She would have loved it."

51:15.740 --> 51:18.207
No, she wouldn't have.

51:18.209 --> 51:20.476
She never would have
bought me a dress.

51:20.478 --> 51:22.111
They don't know me at all.

51:22.747 --> 51:24.113
- They are trying.

51:25.450 --> 51:26.148
- It's white.

51:27.485 --> 51:29.218
- [Cari] Well, what's
wrong with white?

51:32.490 --> 51:36.258
- How old were you
when you got your...

51:36.260 --> 51:38.828
- Oh, you got your period.

51:38.830 --> 51:39.628
That's awesome.

51:40.498 --> 51:42.131
You're becoming a woman.

51:43.401 --> 51:44.467
Here you go.

51:47.138 --> 51:48.871
- I just don't
wanna be anything.

51:51.642 --> 51:52.541
- I get it.

51:54.178 --> 51:56.712
But maybe this
will cheer you up.

52:03.855 --> 52:04.753
I'll leave you be.

52:26.777 --> 52:30.679
(singing in foreign language)

52:41.392 --> 52:45.294
(singing in foreign language)

53:20.231 --> 53:22.831
(dramatic music)

53:43.788 --> 53:45.221
- Hey, hey.

53:45.223 --> 53:46.589
Please, man, this is my stuff.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.859
(dramatic music)

54:04.375 --> 54:05.307
Hey, hey, hey, hang
on a second, man.

54:05.309 --> 54:06.976
- Peter, what's goin' on?

54:06.978 --> 54:08.444
- Please, please sir.

54:08.446 --> 54:09.578
- Sir, we gave you a deadline.

54:09.580 --> 54:10.346
- That's my wife's.

54:10.348 --> 54:11.413
Be careful, huh.

54:11.415 --> 54:11.880
- Sir, step off the boat.

54:11.882 --> 54:13.415
- Please!

54:13.417 --> 54:14.817
- Sir, get off the boat
or I will take action!

54:14.819 --> 54:15.718
- Come on, Pete.

54:17.288 --> 54:18.821
- What the hell
are you doing here?

54:18.823 --> 54:20.422
- Hey, I got a call.

54:20.424 --> 54:22.291
- Oh, so now you two
are working together.

54:22.293 --> 54:23.559
Well, I don't want your help,
so what are you doing here?

54:23.561 --> 54:24.560
- I'm just trying...

54:24.562 --> 54:25.361
- This is because of you.

54:25.363 --> 54:26.328
- [Theo] What?

54:26.330 --> 54:27.630
- It's always the same.

54:27.632 --> 54:29.431
You do what you
want when you want.

54:29.433 --> 54:30.499
- Come on, don't throw this
back on me now, all right?

54:30.501 --> 54:31.367
What do you want from me?

54:31.369 --> 54:32.034
- I want you to...

54:32.837 --> 54:33.936
Just forget it.

54:35.539 --> 54:37.973
- You did this,
you pushed me out.

54:37.975 --> 54:39.575
- Just leave, huh.

54:39.577 --> 54:41.043
Leave like you always do.

54:47.385 --> 54:50.019
(dramatic music)

55:26.857 --> 55:28.490
- That's it, take what you want.

55:31.862 --> 55:32.928
- Whose are these?

55:33.998 --> 55:35.831
- They were my wife's.

55:38.069 --> 55:39.768
Here, come sit down.

55:39.770 --> 55:41.470
I'll tell you all
about her, okay.

55:48.479 --> 55:52.448
She died in her '30s,
when she was 32.

55:52.450 --> 55:55.117
(suspenseful music)

56:15.573 --> 56:18.474
(heavy breathing)

56:22.813 --> 56:24.446
- [Cari] Theo.

56:24.448 --> 56:26.014
- Oh my God.

56:26.016 --> 56:26.915
Oh my God.

56:27.952 --> 56:29.718
- What's going on?

56:30.755 --> 56:31.653
- Nothing.

56:35.860 --> 56:36.825
- You okay?

56:42.466 --> 56:44.433
- What do you want from me?

56:45.136 --> 56:47.035
- Just wanna help you.

56:50.841 --> 56:53.442
- Oh God I keep seeing that.

56:54.945 --> 56:57.045
Oh, God, her face.

56:57.047 --> 56:59.681
Right before it happened.

56:59.683 --> 57:02.050
I can't get it out of my head.

57:08.659 --> 57:09.558
God.

57:24.975 --> 57:27.876
(birds squawking)

57:28.679 --> 57:31.079
(gentle music)

58:00.711 --> 58:01.777
- Oh, good morning.

58:03.514 --> 58:04.613
I made breakfast.

58:19.730 --> 58:20.696
- I'm not hungry.

58:27.505 --> 58:28.971
- Luka's been
asking me questions.

58:29.874 --> 58:31.240
- Ah, not this again.

58:31.242 --> 58:33.242
- She just really wants
to spend time with you.

58:33.244 --> 58:34.142
- [Theo] I know.

58:35.713 --> 58:37.112
- And she's really lost.

58:40.251 --> 58:41.083
I'm just trying to help.

58:41.085 --> 58:41.984
- Stop trying.

58:45.656 --> 58:46.955
- You know, if I had kids,

58:46.957 --> 58:48.624
I would wanna spend
time with them.

58:48.626 --> 58:50.058
- Don't lecture me on parenting.

58:52.897 --> 58:56.298
- The woman in your nightmares.

58:56.300 --> 58:58.634
- I don't wanna talk about it.

58:58.636 --> 59:00.102
- You don't wanna
talk about anything.

59:00.104 --> 59:03.105
You can deal with yourself
and be a father too.

59:03.107 --> 59:05.307
- You comin' at me,
it is not helping.

59:07.011 --> 59:09.878
You know, since I met you
everything is just so messed up.

59:09.880 --> 59:11.547
- What are you talking about?

59:11.549 --> 59:13.215
You're shutting me out
because you don't wanna

59:13.217 --> 59:15.651
face the facts that you
refuse to connect with me

59:15.653 --> 59:17.052
or anyone for that matter.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

59:17.054 --> 59:19.321
I didn't realize you're
a psychiatrist as well.

59:19.323 --> 59:20.689
- I'm not.

59:23.260 --> 59:24.159
- I can't.

59:29.667 --> 59:30.866
This was a mistake.

59:37.007 --> 59:38.941
- You tell yourself
whatever you want.

59:39.977 --> 59:41.176
She needs you.

59:48.686 --> 59:51.153
(gentle music)

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:03.819
(dramatic music)

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:17.199
- Thalassa.

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:37.853
- What the hell?

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:38.954
- I need to ask you something
about my grandmother.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:40.055
- Where is it?

01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:41.323
- Where's what?

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:42.057
- You know what
I'm talking about.

01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:43.024
Answer me.

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:44.826
- Hey, leave her alone.

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:46.895
- She's my kid, I got a right
to ask her if I want to.

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:50.165
- Oh, right, you think you're
gonna be a father now, huh?

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:51.933
- Don't you start.

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:55.003
- I'm the one that raised
her, fed her, clothed her.

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:56.471
- It's because of those
pills that you're on.

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:59.241
- You have to take
responsibility now!

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:01.443
- It isn't my fault

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:03.044
that you couldn't have
a kid of your own.

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:04.146
- Oh, you think you're
some kind of savior?

01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:05.447
Huh?

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.315
You came in here and
you saved a poor couple

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:08.383
by giving them a baby girl.

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:09.851
Is that what you think?

01:03:09.853 --> 01:03:11.520
Hey, did your
father ever tell you

01:03:11.522 --> 01:03:13.922
about that time when me and
Maria took you to the hospital

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:15.791
for whooping cough?

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:19.528
He decided to skip town
on a gambling rampage.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.263
Or how about your Christening?

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:22.330
I caught him dead drunk
with one of the waitresses

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:24.099
in the bathroom.

01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:26.868
And how he pleaded with
your young mother to not...

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:28.103
- Shut your mouth!

01:03:28.105 --> 01:03:30.105
Okay, just shut up!

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:31.873
Don't listen to him, Luka.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:33.275
He doesn't know
what he's sayin'.

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:35.210
He's so hopped up on morphine.

01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:36.812
Yeah, that's right,

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:37.813
he's been filling your
aunt's prescription.

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:52.460
(sobbing)

01:03:58.502 --> 01:03:59.968
(knocking)

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.169
Luka, open up.

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:06.074
You happy now?

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:08.310
- With Maria gone everything
just feels so wrong.

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:11.980
What does she have here?

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:13.982
- A home.

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:16.852
- She wants you.

01:04:18.288 --> 01:04:20.889
I can't be you,
I'm not her father.

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:37.405
- Excuse me, are you the
parent of Luka Markou?

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:38.306
- Yeah.

01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:46.648
(dramatic music)

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.386
- What's taking so long?

01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:09.371
- [Man] Okay, so
I'm just gonna need

01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:10.906
to have you sign
for documentation.

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:12.107
- I should do it.

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:13.174
I'm her legal guardian.

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:14.075
- Oh, 'kay.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.381
So, since most of the
items have been sold

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:21.082
and the money spent,

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:23.518
the patients have decided
not to press charges,

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.322
just so long as you pay back
what the items are worth.

01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:28.990
- Well, how much?

01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:30.125
- About five thousand dollars.

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:31.092
It's...

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.360
- What?

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:34.062
I only got 750
from the pawn shop.

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:35.397
- What were you doing
there in the first place?

01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:36.932
- Father Nick sent
me to read to them.

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:38.400
- But why would you
take those things?

01:05:38.402 --> 01:05:40.468
- I didn't take them,
he gave them to me.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:45.073
Look, I swear, I just wanted
to get money for your boat,

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:47.309
and we have money now to
put towards that motor.

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:49.577
- Motor?

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.947
- I was doing it for you.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:53.515
For us.

01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:59.020
- What happens if we can't pay?

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:00.055
- No, I got it, I got it.

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:01.122
I have it.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:02.457
I just need some time.

01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:09.564
(dramatic music)

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:51.272
- You just gonna keep
staring at your shoes, boy?

01:06:55.379 --> 01:06:56.277
- I...

01:06:57.547 --> 01:06:59.147
- Spit it out, will you?

01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:02.083
You were never a big talker.

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:04.486
Always up in the clouds.

01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:07.288
I would always find you
doing those damn figures.

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:11.292
She did that to you.

01:07:11.294 --> 01:07:14.662
Always so delicate
like a little girl.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:17.732
- And I'm still your son.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:19.534
- And I always
wanted more for you.

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:23.171
- Why do you hate me so much?

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:28.176
- Never, a father
can't hate his son.

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:30.178
I was trying to do right by you.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.613
- Do right?

01:07:31.615 --> 01:07:34.215
- You know, the kid is
nothing like you are.

01:07:35.118 --> 01:07:36.651
She's strong.

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:39.521
Peter will take good care
of her, he'll guide her.

01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:41.623
Thank God he's the
one raising her.

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:44.359
But then I could see it.

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:45.360
- See what?

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:47.529
- You in her.

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:50.665
- Yeah, is that why you
planted that stuff on her?

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.367
She said that she got
everything from in here.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:55.770
You stole it from the
others in here, right?

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:58.807
- You didn't want your own
kid to know her grandfather.

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:02.811
You see, you and I
are exactly the same.

01:08:02.813 --> 01:08:05.146
You always thought I
was a piece of trash.

01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:06.281
Well, what are you...

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:08.316
(coughs)

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:09.584
- You always blamed me.

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:14.722
You could never forget.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.658
- Do you really want to
hear I wish it was you

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.725
instead of my wife?

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:21.196
I wish it was you, I loved
her more than anything.

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:22.464
(coughs)

01:08:22.466 --> 01:08:23.331
- So did I.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:24.466
- Get out!

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:25.733
Your fault she died.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.435
Your brother told me.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:31.473
You went back for
the stupid marriage.

01:08:40.117 --> 01:08:42.216
(knocking)

01:09:28.732 --> 01:09:29.631
- All in.

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:34.502
- All in.

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:42.777
(singing in foreign language)

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:51.685
- Wow.

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:54.355
Wow.

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:57.425
- Thank you very
much, gentlemen.

01:09:57.427 --> 01:09:59.494
- No, no, I wanna play again.

01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:02.330
- [Player] Better
luck next time.

01:10:04.267 --> 01:10:05.433
- No, no no, no.

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:06.467
No, I wanna play again.

01:10:06.469 --> 01:10:07.402
- Game's over, man.

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:09.470
- I wanna play again!

01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:10.572
- [Player] The game is over.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:11.639
- This can't be.

01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:13.775
- Can't do this.

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:21.282
- Wait!

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:23.718
- Listen, just get in
your car and leave.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.953
- No, I need that money.

01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:26.221
- You better watch
yourself, pal.

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:36.598
(engine starting)

01:10:49.646 --> 01:10:50.645
- Go home.

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:51.679
- What happened?

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:53.781
- [Theo] Just leave.

01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:57.352
- Please.

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:58.953
- What do you want with me, huh?

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:00.488
- I just...

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:01.389
- Go, I can't deal
with you right now.

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:02.824
- I just wanna help you.

01:11:02.826 --> 01:11:04.559
- You don't think you've
done enough already?

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:09.764
- Why did you lie to me?

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.499
Why did you tell me he was dead?

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:12.634
- Why did you go
down there to him?

01:11:12.636 --> 01:11:13.868
- I didn't mean to.

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:15.470
I told you the
priest told me to.

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:16.571
I wasn't trying to...

01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:17.805
- Did your grandfather tell you

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:19.474
about what kind of a man he is?

01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:21.042
What kind of a father he was?

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:22.543
- Sorry.

01:11:22.545 --> 01:11:24.279
Look, I know what
you went through.

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:28.816
- What did he say about me?

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:30.685
- I wanna give this back.

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:32.654
I'm sorry, I never should have
taken it in the first place.

01:11:32.656 --> 01:11:34.889
This is yours, just take it.
- No.

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:36.557
- Here, just take it.
- No, I don't want it.

01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:38.760
- I don't want it anymore!

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:43.831
Okay?

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:47.368
I don't want it anymore.

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:49.070
No, I don't want it anymore.

01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:51.706
I don't want it anymore,
I don't want it anymore!

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:53.775
- You are just like him.

01:11:55.345 --> 01:11:57.979
(heavy breathing)

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:04.519
- I don't want you here.

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:05.920
Don't you get it?

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:07.955
I begged your mother.

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:12.860
I begged her, and I begged
her, and I begged her!

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.863
(sobbing)

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:29.811
(yelling)

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:39.854
(dramatic music)

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:09.150
(thudding)

01:13:52.462 --> 01:13:55.062
(gunshot firing)

01:13:58.201 --> 01:14:01.002
(dramatic music)

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:33.034
- Hey.

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:35.570
Join your old man for
a game of cards, okay?

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:36.471
- No.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:42.977
- Oh, that's right.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:44.846
It was never your thing, right?

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:47.248
- What have you done?

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:51.752
- [Crab Apple] That girl
is just like her father.

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:53.788
- You know you've made things
much worse for her, right?

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.523
- All this time you've
been comin' here

01:14:55.525 --> 01:14:56.958
lying to me, right?

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.628
You said her real mother
came back for her.

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.096
- I didn't want her to see you.

01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:03.698
- What, you're
embarrassed of me?

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:04.532
- No.

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:10.104
She's just a child.

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:11.739
- Look, I remember when
she was a little baby

01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:13.741
bouncin' on my knee.

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:14.976
We were happy.

01:15:16.079 --> 01:15:18.012
As long as the money was there.

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:20.281
- Oh, all right, is
that what this is about?

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:22.717
- Well, I do know
why you put me here.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.986
- To take care of you.

01:15:26.256 --> 01:15:28.823
- You put me here
to get rid of me.

01:15:28.825 --> 01:15:31.626
I used to be your
partner, remember that?

01:15:31.628 --> 01:15:33.194
That was my business.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:35.997
I gotta know why you
shoved me to the side.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:38.666
You chose him.

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:41.936
- You have two sons, not one.

01:15:41.938 --> 01:15:42.970
- One.

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:44.805
- No, no, you've always had two.

01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:49.243
You wanna know the truth?

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.581
I wanted to lock you
up like a caged animal

01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:56.617
for the way you treated
him all those years.

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:58.986
- You really have
no idea what I saw,

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:01.188
what I was forced
to do in that war.

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:04.559
You never saw the
things I did after.

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:07.094
It wasn't really me.

01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:09.997
You're hating the
wrong person, Peter.

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:11.766
- You always blamed him.

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:13.801
Something he had
no control over.

01:16:15.872 --> 01:16:16.904
You couldn't be rid of it.

01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:20.608
You had to destroy
our lives with it.

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:24.779
No more.

01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:25.680
- I'm your father.

01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:28.849
- No, you're breakin'
up this family.

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:31.352
- Hey, you be back.

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:33.621
You always come back.

01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:35.790
- No.

01:16:36.993 --> 01:16:38.092
Not this time.

01:16:42.231 --> 01:16:43.130
Theo.

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:45.032
Theo.

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:49.770
Theo.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:50.805
Theo, are you okay?

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:51.973
You okay?

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.214
Are you okay, what did you do?

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:02.750
What are you doing with those?

01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:03.718
Did you take them?

01:17:07.657 --> 01:17:08.856
- I lost it.

01:17:10.093 --> 01:17:11.392
- It's okay, I took care of it.

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:14.829
- What, how?

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:16.030
- Maria's necklace.

01:17:16.032 --> 01:17:16.931
I sold it.

01:17:17.834 --> 01:17:19.166
- No.

01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:21.102
No, you shouldn't
have done that.

01:17:22.739 --> 01:17:25.006
- It's always been
you and me, brother.

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:26.007
Just you and me.

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:29.010
I thought things
would be better.

01:17:31.781 --> 01:17:32.680
- Where's Luka?

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:35.816
- I don't know.

01:17:39.389 --> 01:17:41.856
(grunting)

01:17:43.026 --> 01:17:45.826
(dramatic music)

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:29.370
- Don't.

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:34.942
- You wanna talk?

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:37.878
- Don't you think it's
a little late for that?

01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:44.018
Why did you give me away?

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:47.088
- It's complicated.

01:18:48.324 --> 01:18:50.257
- So where's my real mother?

01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:50.991
- She was young.

01:18:51.994 --> 01:18:53.294
She wasn't ready for a baby.

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.063
She left you at the hospital.

01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.066
Hey, I don't know where she is.

01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:01.368
- Did you love my mother?

01:19:05.274 --> 01:19:08.042
(dramatic music)

01:19:09.946 --> 01:19:11.378
- I saw the sign that you made.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:14.482
Why didn't you tell me?

01:19:15.985 --> 01:19:17.051
- I tried.

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:19.987
You never listen to me.

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:22.823
- Well, I am now.

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:28.362
- I don't want you in my life.

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:30.931
- No.

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:32.299
- You ruin everything.

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:34.034
You even made Cari leave.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:35.770
- No, please, I'm sorry.

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:36.904
- Don't you want me?

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:38.272
- Yes, of course I do.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:41.909
- Then why did you
give me to Peter?

01:19:41.911 --> 01:19:43.210
- Better life for you.

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:44.545
- [Luka] Away from you?

01:19:44.547 --> 01:19:46.814
- I couldn't give
you what you needed.

01:19:48.217 --> 01:19:52.119
Luka, I love you.

01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:02.930
- Don't leave.

01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:04.999
- Never again.

01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:05.900
I promise.

01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:08.235
Promise.

01:20:10.072 --> 01:20:11.839
(sobbing)

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:17.011
I'm here now, I'm not
going anywhere, okay.

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:47.308
- [Luka] Lately, my father and I

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:49.076
have been taking the boat out.

01:20:50.413 --> 01:20:52.446
We swim in the deep waters.

01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:58.853
At times, when I can't
seem to catch my breath,

01:21:00.323 --> 01:21:03.991
I look over and he is there.

01:21:05.394 --> 01:21:08.329
(dramatic music)

01:21:45.534 --> 01:21:48.168
(gentle music)
