No, I got away with
way more murders than you did.

that acquisition.

what Nicholas was after.

He kept a lot of
important people out of jail.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.880

11:46.923 --> 11:48.882

Absolute loyalty.

you trying to save your ass.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.939
Who else would you trust here?

37:25.982 --> 37:28.158
I mean, the doctor
in this facility--

37:28.202 --> 37:30.378
he's no better
than the executioner.

37:30.422 --> 37:32.598
I, on the other hand...

37:32.641 --> 37:34.382
They won't let you treat me.

37:34.426 --> 37:37.472
Oh, I-I advise physicians
all over the world.

37:37.516 --> 37:38.517
Yeah, uh, including several

37:38.560 --> 37:41.259
exceptional neurosurgeons.

37:43.130 --> 37:44.305
I-I would suggest

37:44.349 --> 37:47.526
that a consult from one of them

37:47.569 --> 37:49.310
is worth far more

37:49.354 --> 37:51.399
than the bounty on my head.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.445
Hmm?

37:58.014 --> 38:00.321
NICHOLAS:
Malcolm. Come in.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.236
Sit down.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.326
Now that we're all here,
our family meeting can begin.

38:15.075 --> 38:17.033
[indistinct chatter]

38:17.077 --> 38:18.557
[lock buzzes]

38:18.600 --> 38:20.341
-[keys jingle]
-[latch clicks]

38:20.385 --> 38:22.387
GUARD:
Let's move.

38:28.567 --> 38:29.524
[lock buzzes]

38:29.568 --> 38:32.135
-[keys jingle]
-[latch clicks]

38:32.179 --> 38:33.528
Look away.

38:33.572 --> 38:34.660
He's with me.

38:34.703 --> 38:36.444
Nah, he's got to die.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.491
-GUARD: Lock it down!
-[alarm blaring]

38:39.534 --> 38:41.319
We need help in here!

38:41.362 --> 38:43.277
-Uh-oh...
-MAN [over P.A.]: All guards,

38:43.321 --> 38:46.454
-report to cellblock A
immediately.
-Here we go.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.109
Did he hurt you?

38:49.152 --> 38:52.242
Not a hair on her head.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.641
What the hell
are you doing here?

39:01.295 --> 39:03.732
Sit. All will be explained
over a nightcap.

39:03.776 --> 39:06.431
No doubt you could use one

39:06.474 --> 39:08.476
after the day you've had.

39:10.609 --> 39:12.045
Whatever you think
you're doing here...

39:12.088 --> 39:15.048
BRIGHT:
It's okay, Ainsley.

39:15.091 --> 39:17.442
He doesn't know
how thoroughly screwed he is.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.619
As we speak,

39:20.662 --> 39:22.490
Major Crimes
is getting a warrant

39:22.534 --> 39:24.492
to search your house,

39:24.536 --> 39:25.711
your office

39:25.754 --> 39:27.408
and the three secret offices

39:27.452 --> 39:29.541
you think we don't know about.

39:29.584 --> 39:31.412
So please,

39:31.456 --> 39:33.632
enjoy the Scotch.

39:33.675 --> 39:36.417
It'll be your last.

39:36.461 --> 39:39.551
I'm afraid those warrants
won't amount to much.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.774
You had Gil stabbed.

39:48.647 --> 39:51.040
You mean my assistant Aaron.

39:51.084 --> 39:52.607
One rotten apple

39:52.651 --> 39:55.480
in an otherwise
clean organization.

39:56.785 --> 39:58.396
And he must have known

39:58.439 --> 40:01.355
that his misdeeds
were gonna catch up to him,

40:01.399 --> 40:03.488
because he took his own life

40:03.531 --> 40:05.054
just a few hours ago.

40:13.976 --> 40:16.544
You can't just keep
silencing people.

40:16.588 --> 40:18.546
Oh, I think you'll find I can.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.722
Actually, it's what I do best.

40:24.726 --> 40:26.336
You know, you should
really have that tremor

40:26.380 --> 40:28.164
-checked out. Have you ever...
-Shut up!

40:28.208 --> 40:30.558
Stop! Just stop!

40:32.255 --> 40:33.648
[gun cocks]

40:36.521 --> 40:38.740
You killed Eve.

40:38.784 --> 40:41.047
Framed me for
murdering her killer.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.570
You may...

40:44.529 --> 40:46.879
You may have killed Gil Arroyo.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.666
Now you deserve
to die, Nicholas.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.019
My son.

40:57.063 --> 40:59.761
I will always love you.
Because we're the same.

41:01.241 --> 41:02.547
You know,

41:02.590 --> 41:05.463
you really are
your mother's son, Malcolm.

41:06.333 --> 41:08.291
All smoke.

41:08.335 --> 41:10.816
No fire.

41:10.859 --> 41:13.253
She couldn't
go all the way, either,

41:13.296 --> 41:15.429
which is a shame.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.213
She's brilliant in the sack.

41:18.824 --> 41:21.783
We'll find the evidence,
the witnesses

41:21.827 --> 41:24.394
and I will arrest you!

41:24.438 --> 41:25.526
No, you won't.

41:25.570 --> 41:28.442
The whole system is mine.
I own it.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.661
I can do anything I want.

41:29.704 --> 41:30.966
Aah!

41:41.629 --> 41:43.501
[screaming]

41:58.820 --> 42:00.474
What did you do?

42:06.132 --> 42:07.525
-[men shouting]
-[alarm blaring]

42:23.715 --> 42:26.456
AINSLEY:
[sharp inhale] Wha...

42:26.500 --> 42:27.806
What...

42:29.808 --> 42:31.984
What just happened?

42:33.768 --> 42:36.684
-It's okay, Ainsley. It's...
-[phone vibrates]

42:40.470 --> 42:41.820
-[men shouting]
-[alarm blaring]

42:41.863 --> 42:42.995
Hello?

42:43.038 --> 42:44.344
My boy!

42:44.387 --> 42:45.650
It's Dad.

42:45.693 --> 42:47.173
How's it going?

42:47.216 --> 42:48.783
Not great.

42:48.827 --> 42:50.785
Well, don't worry about me.

42:50.829 --> 42:52.700
Things are looking up.

42:52.744 --> 42:54.963
I took Ainsley's advice.

42:58.750 --> 43:01.187
And she took yours.

43:01.230 --> 43:03.232
Really?

43:06.714 --> 43:08.716
My girl.
