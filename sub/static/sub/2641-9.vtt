WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:03.900
So two years later,
there's a knock on the door.

00:03.967 --> 00:06.034
Guy opens it, and there on his porch
 is the snail

00:06.101 --> 00:08.067
who says, "What the heck
was all that about?"

00:08.134 --> 00:10.134
(both laughing)

00:11.434 --> 00:13.301
I don't really get it.

00:13.368 --> 00:16.567
Well, see, it took two
years for the snail ...

00:20.368 --> 00:22.767
Not important.

00:22.767 --> 00:25.401
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.234
Where do you think
this is going?

00:28.667 --> 00:31.567
To be honest, I was hoping
at least second base.

00:32.934 --> 00:34.533
You're so funny.

00:35.234 --> 00:37.900
You're like
a stand-up comedian.

00:37.900 --> 00:40.867
A Jewish stand-up comedian,
that'd be new.

00:41.767 --> 00:45.867
Actually, I think a lot
of them are Jewish.

00:45.867 --> 00:49.800
No, I was just...
Never mind.

00:49.800 --> 00:54.567
Look, Howard, this is our third date.
We both know what that means.

00:54.567 --> 00:57.500
We do?
Sex.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.600
You're kidding.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.266
But I need to know
whether you're looking

01:04.266 --> 01:07.067
for a relationship
or a one-night stand.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.867
Okay, just to be clear:

01:08.867 --> 01:11.834
there's only one
correct answer, right?

01:11.834 --> 01:14.567
It's not like "chicken
or fish" on an airplane?

01:14.567 --> 01:16.800
Maybe you need to think
about it a little.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.900
You know,
it's not unheard of

01:18.900 --> 01:21.967
for a one-night stand to turn
into a relationship.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.201
Call me when you figure it out.

01:29.434 --> 01:32.900
Three dates means sex?

01:36.567 --> 01:38.934
Who knew?

01:43.500 --> 01:44.334
Greetings, homies.

01:45.534 --> 01:46.833
Homette.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.701
Why are you back from
your date so early?

01:49.701 --> 01:52.500
In romance,
as in show business,

01:52.500 --> 01:54.967
always leave them wanting more.

01:56.267 --> 01:58.600
What exactly
does that mean?

01:58.600 --> 02:00.600
He struck out.

02:00.600 --> 02:04.168
* Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state *

02:04.168 --> 02:07.434
* Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *

02:07.434 --> 02:09.068
* The Ear began to cool

02:09.068 --> 02:11.534
* The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools *

02:11.534 --> 02:14.168
<i>* We built the Wall
We built the pyramids *</i>

02:14.168 --> 02:16.801
* Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery *

02:16.801 --> 02:18.667
* That all started
with a big bang *

02:18.667 --> 02:20.600
<i>* Bang! *</i>

02:20.601 --> 02:26.601

02:27.067 --> 02:28.867
Hey, did either
of you guys know

02:28.867 --> 02:30.434
that three dates
with the same woman

02:30.434 --> 02:32.301
is the threshold for sex?

02:32.301 --> 02:35.334
Actually, I've never had three dates with
the same woman.

02:36.167 --> 02:38.833
With Penny and me,
it took two years.

02:38.833 --> 02:42.634
Now that I think about it,
that was three dates.

02:42.634 --> 02:45.367
Okay, well, before you
and Penny hooked up,

02:45.367 --> 02:47.800
did she ask for any
kind of commitment?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.900
No, she was pretty clear about

02:49.900 --> 02:52.668
wanting to keep
her options open.

02:52.668 --> 02:54.934
I have something to announce,

02:54.934 --> 02:57.367
but out of respect for convention,
 I will wait for you

02:57.367 --> 02:59.134
To finish your
current conversation.

02:59.134 --> 03:00.767
What are you
talking about?

03:00.767 --> 03:02.934
The cultural paradigm
in which people have sex

03:02.934 --> 03:04.234
after three dates.

03:04.234 --> 03:05.534
I see.

03:05.534 --> 03:07.700
Now, are we talking "date,"
the social interaction,

03:07.700 --> 03:10.134
or "date,"
the dried fruit?

03:12.267 --> 03:14.800
Never mind,
what's your announcement?

03:14.800 --> 03:17.234
Oh, good, my turn.
Well, this is very exciting

03:17.234 --> 03:19.767
and I wanted you to be
among the first to know...

03:19.767 --> 03:21.767
Hey, Cooper. I hear you’re going
To be on the radio

03:21.767 --> 03:23.367
<i>with Ira Flatow
from Science Friday next week.</i>

03:23.367 --> 03:26.934
Thank you, Kripke, for depriving
me of the opportunity

03:26.934 --> 03:29.134
<i>to share my news
with my friends.</i>

03:29.134 --> 03:31.034
My pleasure.

03:31.034 --> 03:32.833
My "thank you"
was not sincere.

03:32.833 --> 03:35.201
But "my pleasure" is.

03:35.201 --> 03:36.867
Let me ask you

03:36.867 --> 03:40.167
a question:  at what point
did National Public Radio

03:40.167 --> 03:42.067
have to start scraping
the bottom of the barrel

03:42.067 --> 03:43.733
for its guests

03:43.733 --> 03:46.501
Don't answer.
It's rhetorical.

03:46.501 --> 03:49.601
Why are you such a stupid head?

03:50.334 --> 03:53.267
That is also rhetorical.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.668
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

03:58.168 --> 04:00.233
Are you really
going to be on NPR?

04:00.233 --> 04:03.134
Yes, they're interviewing me
by phone from my office,

04:03.134 --> 04:05.134
regarding the recent so-called
"discovery"

04:05.134 --> 04:07.434
of magnetic monopoles
in spin-ices.

04:07.434 --> 04:10.134
It's pledge week and they're
trying to goose the ratings

04:10.134 --> 04:11.901
with a little controversy.

04:12.701 --> 04:14.300
Very cool,
congratulations.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.500
Thank you.
My mother is very excited.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.333
<i>She's convening her Bible study
group to listen in,</i>

04:19.333 --> 04:21.767
and then pray for my soul.

04:22.701 --> 04:24.068
I was on the radio once.

04:24.068 --> 04:26.333
I called in
to Fever 104 FM New Delhi

04:26.333 --> 04:28.734
and was the fourth person
to say the phrase that pays:

04:28.734 --> 04:32.367
<i>"Fever 104, aajke naye
acchha sangeetka ghar."</i>

04:33.967 --> 04:36.701
That means: "Fever 104,

04:36.701 --> 04:39.200
home of the really
good current music."

04:41.834 --> 04:43.467
It's much catchier
in Hindi.

04:46.634 --> 04:50.001
All right. These are
the talking points

04:50.001 --> 04:52.600
for  NPR
interview tomorrow.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.567
I need to make sure
that they're simple enough

04:54.567 --> 04:57.734
for the less educated in
the audience to understand.

04:57.734 --> 05:00.867
Howard, look this over
and tell me what’s unclear to you.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.867
Excuse me, I have a master's degree
 in engineering

05:03.867 --> 05:05.934
from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

05:05.934 --> 05:08.600
It required the completion
of 144 units of grad work

05:08.600 --> 05:10.001
<i>and an original thesis.</i>

05:10.001 --> 05:12.567
Yes.

05:12.567 --> 05:15.068
Look this over and tell me what's
unclear to you.

05:16.934 --> 05:18.701
You know, when Sheldon
gives you homework,

05:18.701 --> 05:20.567
you don't have to do it.

05:20.567 --> 05:22.233
In fact, it's better
if you don't,

05:22.233 --> 05:24.434
otherwise it makes
the rest of us look bad.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.967
Hi, guys.
Hey. Hello.

05:27.967 --> 05:29.434
Yo, Raj, talk to me.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.300
I'm sorry,
just screwing with you.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.734
Hey, Howard, why haven't
you called Bernadette?

05:44.734 --> 05:46.201
Did she say something?

05:46.201 --> 05:47.867
Yeah, she said she hasn't
heard from you in a week.

05:47.867 --> 05:49.001
I thought you liked her?

05:49.001 --> 05:51.368
I do, but she wants a commitment

05:51.368 --> 05:53.767
and I'm not sure she's my type.

05:53.767 --> 05:55.368
She agreed to go out
with you for free.

05:55.368 --> 05:57.001
What more do you need?

05:57.001 --> 05:59.368
Look, Bernadette is really nice.

05:59.368 --> 06:01.600
I just always thought
when I finally settle down

06:01.600 --> 06:03.734
into a relationship,
it would be with someone,

06:03.734 --> 06:05.467
you know, different.

06:05.467 --> 06:06.934
Different how?

06:06.934 --> 06:11.034
<i>Well, you know, more like
Men Fox from Transformers.</i>

06:12.300 --> 06:13.567
Or Katee Sackhoff

06:13.567 --> 06:15.467
<i>from Battlestar Galactica.</i>

06:15.467 --> 06:17.834
Are you high?

06:18.801 --> 06:20.367
You'd have a better shot
with the three-breasted

06:20.367 --> 06:22.768
<i>Martian hooker
from Total Recall.</i>

06:24.000 --> 06:26.667
Okay, now you're just
being unrealistic.

06:27.567 --> 06:29.167
Anyway, that movie
was like 20 years ago.

06:29.167 --> 06:31.801
Imagine how saggy
those things would be.

06:36.067 --> 06:39.167
Howard, you're going
to throw ay a great girl like Bernadette

06:39.167 --> 06:41.768
because you're holding out
for some ridiculous fantasy?

06:41.768 --> 06:45.634
Hey, just because you settled
doesn't mean I have to.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.401
Excuse me,
I'm sitting here.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.434
Hey, I did not
settle for Leonard.

06:52.434 --> 06:56.534
I mean, obviously, he isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with...

06:56.534 --> 06:58.900
You know, physically.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.167
Again, I'm right here.

07:02.134 --> 07:04.234
My point is, I do not
judge a book by its cover.

07:04.234 --> 07:05.868
I am interested
in the person underneath.

07:05.868 --> 07:08.234
I am here, right?
You see me.

07:13.334 --> 07:17.434
Hey, I'm interested
in what's inside people, too,

07:17.434 --> 07:20.634
but why is it wrong to want
those insides wrapped up in,

07:20.634 --> 07:24.234
say, the delicious caramel
that is Halle Berry?

07:25.367 --> 07:28.567
Yes, you're delicious
caramel, too.

07:33.768 --> 07:35.067
All right, you know what,
I will tell you

07:35.067 --> 07:36.667
why it's wrong...
Excuse me, may I interject?

07:37.167 --> 07:38.167
What?

07:38.167 --> 07:40.001
Biologically speaking,

07:40.001 --> 07:42.967
Howard is perfectly justified
in seeking out the optimum mate

07:42.967 --> 07:45.600
for the propagation
of his genetic line.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.767
Thank you, Sheldon.
Now, whether that

07:47.767 --> 07:49.901
propagation is in the interest
of humanity is, of course,

07:49.901 --> 07:51.700
an entirely different question.

07:54.867 --> 07:57.167
This is Ira Flatow
and you're listening

07:57.167 --> 08:00.034
<i>to NPR's Science Friday.</i>

08:00.034 --> 08:01.500
Joining us today by phone
(helium hissing)

08:01.500 --> 08:03.901
from his office
in Pasadena, California

08:03.901 --> 08:05.901
is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

08:05.901 --> 08:08.634
Oh, this is going to be a riot.

08:11.101 --> 08:13.101
FLATOW:
Thanks for being
with us today, Dr. Cooper.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.700
My pleasure, Ira.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.634
Now, let's talk about
magnetic monopoles.

08:18.634 --> 08:22.600
Can you explain to our audience
just what a monopole is?

08:22.600 --> 08:23.734
Of course.

08:23.734 --> 08:28.067
First, consider an ordinary
magnet which has,

08:28.067 --> 08:29.667
(pitch raises):
as even the most uneducated

08:29.667 --> 08:32.400
in your audience
must know, two poles.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.301
(clears throat)

08:34.301 --> 08:37.368
(pitch raises):
A north and south pole.

08:37.368 --> 08:40.833
If you cut that in half,
you have two smaller magnets,

08:40.833 --> 08:43.533
each with its own
north and south pole.

08:43.533 --> 08:46.500
Uh, Dr. Cooper,
I think there might be

08:46.500 --> 08:47.967
something wrong
with our connection.

08:47.967 --> 08:51.268
(higher pitch):
No, I hear you fine.

08:51.268 --> 08:55.334
As I was saying, an ordinary
magnet has two poles.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.867
The primary characteristic
of a monopole

08:57.867 --> 09:01.368
is that it has only one pole,
hence, monopole.

09:02.867 --> 09:04.934
SHELDON (over radio):
A requirement for string theory,

09:04.934 --> 09:06.834
or M-they, if you will,

09:06.834 --> 09:09.567
is the existence
of such monopoles.

09:09.567 --> 09:11.767
I, myself, led an expedition

09:11.767 --> 09:13.834
to the Arctic Circle
in search of said particles.

09:13.834 --> 09:16.467
Kripke, I found the nozzle!
I'm going to kill you!

09:24.267 --> 09:26.334
So nice you could
join me this evening.

09:26.334 --> 09:28.501
You're looking lovely as always.

09:29.967 --> 09:31.200
Thanks, Howard.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.967
Always nice to be part
of your masturbatory fantasies.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.234
Come on, Katee

09:37.234 --> 09:38.900
Don't make it sound so cheap.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.300
I'm sorry, fiddling
with yourself in the bathtub

09:41.300 --> 09:43.100
is a real class act.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.734
Thank you.

09:46.734 --> 09:49.567
So, shall we get started?

09:50.634 --> 09:52.467
Sure.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.334
But can I ask you
a question first?

09:54.334 --> 09:56.734
Do you want to play
Cylon and colonist?

09:56.734 --> 09:58.067
No.

09:58.067 --> 09:59.868
I want to know why you're
playing make-believe with me

09:59.868 --> 10:01.734
when you could be out
with a real woman tonight.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.301
You mean, Bernadette?

10:04.301 --> 10:06.467
No, I mean Princess Leia.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.067
Of course
I mean Bernadette.

10:08.067 --> 10:11.201
She's a wonderful girl
and she really likes you.

10:11.201 --> 10:13.934
I know, but she's not you.

10:13.934 --> 10:16.167
I'm not me.

10:17.101 --> 10:18.167
The real me is in Beverly Hills

10:18.167 --> 10:19.834
going out with a tall,
handsome, rich guy.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.101
Really? Tall?

10:21.101 --> 10:22.501
Six-four.
Ouch.

10:24.302 --> 10:26.301
But come on, you got a wonderful
girl in your life

10:26.301 --> 10:28.234
and you're ignoring her
in order to spend your nights

10:28.234 --> 10:31.400
in the bathtub with mental
image and a wash cloth.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.900
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard!

10:35.900 --> 10:38.067
What are you
doing in there?

10:38.067 --> 10:40.000
I'm taking a bath!

10:40.001 --> 10:42.000
I hope that's all you're doing.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.100
We share that tub!

10:46.401 --> 10:48.567
Don't remind me!

10:51.167 --> 10:52.834
Oh, man.

10:52.834 --> 10:56.501
All soaped up
and no place to go.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.167
(knocking at door)

11:04.400 --> 11:05.734
How ya doin', buddy?

11:05.734 --> 11:08.234
I was humiliated
on national radio.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.400
How do you think I'm doing?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.167
Come on, it wasn't
that bad.

11:11.167 --> 11:12.867
(sighs):
What do you want?

11:12.867 --> 11:15.001
We represent
the Lollipop Guild,

11:15.001 --> 11:17.134
and we want you.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.734
Okay, so Kripke
played a joke on you.

11:24.734 --> 11:26.001
It wasn't funny.

11:26.001 --> 11:28.034
I thought it was funny.
Raj.

11:28.034 --> 11:29.368
You laughed.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.134
Did you laugh?

11:33.533 --> 11:35.533
I fell on the floor.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.933
All right, he got you.

11:38.933 --> 11:40.300
You can get him back.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.501
I refuse to sink to his level.

11:42.501 --> 11:44.634
You can't sink. 
With all that helium in you

11:44.634 --> 11:46.801
you're lucky you don't
(high pitched): float away.

11:49.900 --> 11:53.300
Are you really admitting defeat?
I’m never admitting defeat.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.434
Good.

11:54.434 --> 11:55.667
However, on an unrelated topic,

11:55.667 --> 11:58.501
I am never getting out
of this bed again.

11:58.501 --> 12:00.567
What if you could
make Kripke

12:00.567 --> 12:02.434
look even sillier
than he made you look?

12:02.434 --> 12:03.601
I don't think
that's possible, dude.

12:03.601 --> 12:05.000
You're not helping.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
I didn't come to help,
I came to mock.

12:09.267 --> 12:11.567
Sheldon, what you need to do
is figure out a way

12:12.067 --> 12:14.867
to exact vengeance on Kripke,
like, uh

12:14.867 --> 12:18.268
like, how the Joker got back
at Batman for putting him

12:18.268 --> 12:21.234
in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
That's true.

12:21.234 --> 12:22.901
He didn't just stay there
and talk about his feelings

12:22.901 --> 12:24.268
with the other
psychotic villains.

12:24.268 --> 12:27.667
He, he broke out and poisoned
Gotham's water supply.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.433
Well...

12:31.433 --> 12:33.567
I suppose I could poison Kripke.
No!

12:33.567 --> 12:35.001
No.
It's a simple matter.

12:35.001 --> 12:36.500
There are several toxic
chemicals

12:36.500 --> 12:39.467
that'd be untraceable
in an autopsy.

12:40.433 --> 12:42.834
Okay, uh, that's the spirit,

12:42.834 --> 12:45.167
but, um, let's dial it back

12:45.167 --> 12:48.234
to a non-lethal form
of vengeance.

12:49.234 --> 12:50.567
Oh!

12:51.567 --> 12:54.600
How about we whoopee cushion
on his office chair?

12:55.734 --> 12:56.934
He'll sit down,
it'll sound like

12:56.934 --> 12:59.368
he's flatulent,
even though he's not.

13:01.167 --> 13:02.767
Let's keep thinking.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.934
Oh, gee,
you're too late.

13:08.934 --> 13:11.268
Scarlett Johansson and
Wonder Woman were just in here

13:11.268 --> 13:14.067
trolling around for
neurotic, little weasels.

13:14.567 --> 13:17.401
I came to talk to Bernadette.
She's working today, right?

13:17.401 --> 13:19.900
Yes, but I don't think
she wants to see you.

13:19.900 --> 13:20.900
Why not?

13:20.900 --> 13:22.567
Come on, Howard.
You hurt her feelings

13:22.567 --> 13:24.000
by not calling her all week.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.334
Plus, I've kind of been
talkin' some smack about ya.

13:28.167 --> 13:29.300
Hello, Howard.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.401
Wait, Bernadette,
I need to talk to you.

13:31.401 --> 13:32.501
I can't now, I'm working.

13:32.501 --> 13:34.033
This will only take a second.

13:34.033 --> 13:35.768
You asked me
to think about where

13:35.768 --> 13:38.634
our relationship
was going, and I did.

13:39.567 --> 13:41.367
Bernadette?

13:45.134 --> 13:47.567
Will you marry me?

13:49.234 --> 13:52.534
Is this more comedy
that I don't understand?

13:52.534 --> 13:55.467
No. I'm serious.

13:55.467 --> 13:58.000
I'm never going to find
another girl like you

13:58.000 --> 14:01.834
who likes me and is,
you know, real.

14:03.834 --> 14:05.234
So, this isn't a joke?

14:05.234 --> 14:07.900
No.
Then you're insane.

14:09.067 --> 14:12.467
I prefer to think
of myself as quirky.

14:12.467 --> 14:14.801
Howard, we've only
been on three dates.

14:14.801 --> 14:16.868
We haven't even had sex yet.

14:16.868 --> 14:18.033
Fair enough.

14:18.033 --> 14:20.100
When's your break?

14:20.100 --> 14:22.234
Wow.

14:24.634 --> 14:27.967
Don't you just hate
when this happens?

14:27.967 --> 14:30.401
Wow.

14:34.167 --> 14:38.234
All right,
how's this for revenge?

14:38.234 --> 14:40.634
A solution of
hydrogen peroxide,

14:40.634 --> 14:44.000
and one of saturated
potassium iodide.

14:44.201 --> 14:45.201
What's this?

14:45.300 --> 14:47.467
Mountain Dew.

14:49.601 --> 14:51.667
Ahh, refreshing.

14:51.667 --> 14:53.734
Now, we're going to
combine these chemicals

14:53.734 --> 14:55.067
with ordinary dish soap,

14:55.067 --> 14:59.534
<i>creating a little exothermic
release of oxygen.</i>

15:02.900 --> 15:05.033
(all exclaiming)

15:11.201 --> 15:12.667
Foamy vengeance.

15:12.667 --> 15:13.901
Yes, exactly.

15:13.901 --> 15:16.001
This is brilliant, Sheldon.

15:16.001 --> 15:18.001
How are we going to deploy it
in Kripke's office?

15:18.001 --> 15:19.834
Already taken care of.

15:19.834 --> 15:22.134
Observe.
(typing)

15:22.835 --> 15:25.335
This is a live shot of Kripke's lab

15:25.335 --> 15:28.500
via a mini webcam I was able to install,
thanks to a dollar bill

15:28.500 --> 15:31.267
discreetly placed in the night
janitor's shirt pocket.

15:31.267 --> 15:32.601
At the same time,

15:32.601 --> 15:34.667
I also secured large quantities

15:34.667 --> 15:37.701
of these chemicals above
the tiles in the drop ceiling.

15:37.701 --> 15:39.300
Oh, Sheldon,

15:39.300 --> 15:41.100
you remind me
of a young Lex Luthor.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.434
(chuckles)

15:44.100 --> 15:45.367
You flatter me, sir.

15:46.868 --> 15:46.367
- Let me guess. Motion sensors?
- Yes.

15:48.367 --> 15:50.200
The reaction will be triggered

15:50.200 --> 15:52.267
when Kripke reaches
the center of the room.

15:52.267 --> 15:54.434
Mwa, ha, ha.

15:56.933 --> 15:59.667
I gotta say,
I am really impressed.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.467
This is truly the Sheldon Cooper
way to get even.

16:02.467 --> 16:04.601
(whoopee cushion expels)

16:08.368 --> 16:10.400
It may be low-tech

16:10.400 --> 16:13.101
but I still maintain the whoopee
cushion has comic validity.

16:14.734 --> 16:16.234
Here comes Kripke!

16:16.234 --> 16:17.934
LEONARD:
Who is that with him?

16:17.934 --> 16:20.734
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I believe that's
the president of the university.

16:20.734 --> 16:22.467
And the board of directors.
Abort! Abort!

16:22.467 --> 16:23.600
There is no "abort."

16:23.600 --> 16:25.134
How could you not put in
an "abort?"

16:25.134 --> 16:27.500
I made a boo-boo, all right?

16:27.500 --> 16:29.334
KRIPKE:
I think the board
will really appreciate

16:29.334 --> 16:32.201
how well we're using that
NSA grant, President Seibert.

16:32.201 --> 16:34.433
Right here we have
a micro-controlled plasma...

16:41.800 --> 16:44.667
Wow. Looks like the
Ganges on laundry day.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.768
At least they don't know
it was you.

16:49.768 --> 16:51.234
(chiming)

16:51.234 --> 16:52.768
SHELDON (on computer):
Hello, Kripke.

16:52.768 --> 16:55.100
This classic prank
comes to you

16:55.100 --> 16:58.734
from the malevolent mind
of Sheldon Cooper.

16:58.734 --> 17:00.501
If you'd like to see the look

17:00.501 --> 17:03.100
on your stupid face,
this video is being

17:03.100 --> 17:05.601
instantly uploaded to YouTube.

17:05.601 --> 17:08.367
Oh, and a hat tip
to Leonard Hofstadter

17:08.367 --> 17:11.534
And Raj Koothrappali
for their support

17:12.034 --> 17:14.900
and encouragement
in this enterprise.

17:17.467 --> 17:18.768
Well, I'm going back to India.

17:18.769 --> 17:19.769
What's your plan?

17:26.201 --> 17:27.800
Hey, he's your tip
from table seven.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.134
Oh, thanks
Mm-hmm.

17:29.134 --> 17:30.301
WOLOWITZ:
Testing. Check.

17:30.301 --> 17:31.600
Check two.

17:32.767 --> 17:34.301
Oh, now what?

17:34.301 --> 17:36.001
You want me
to throw him out?

17:36.001 --> 17:37.167
No, that's okay.

17:37.167 --> 17:39.600
Are you sure? He's small.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.101
I bet I can get a nice,
tight spiral on him.

17:43.433 --> 17:45.368
I want to dedicate this number

17:45.368 --> 17:48.201
to a great gal
who I've done wrong.

17:50.001 --> 17:53.368
(plays The Four Tops "Bernadette")
* Bernadette

17:53.368 --> 17:56.201
* I am so sorry for

17:56.201 --> 17:58.567
* Trying to propose to you

17:59.567 --> 18:01.767
* Bernadette

18:01.767 --> 18:04.101
* You found it creepy

18:04.101 --> 18:07.967
* But that's just
the kind of thing I  do*

18:07.967 --> 18:10.101
* Ahh...

18:10.101 --> 18:14.001
* I know now it was too soon
to talk of love *

18:14.001 --> 18:18.201
* It was just a crazy idea that
came to me in my tub *

18:18.201 --> 18:21.134
* But, Bernadette,
give me one more chance *

18:21.134 --> 18:22.400
(falsetto):
* Sweet Bernadette

18:22.400 --> 18:24.101
* I'll get the hang
of this thing *

18:24.101 --> 18:26.134
* They call romance, Sweet Bernadette,

18:26.134 --> 18:28.234
I dream to once again *

18:28.234 --> 18:30.901
* Kiss your lips,
Sweet Bernadette *

18:30.901 --> 18:32.533
* Sincerely yours

18:32.533 --> 18:34.734
* Howard Wolowitz

18:34.734 --> 18:36.101
* Bernadette...

18:36.101 --> 18:40.034
Oh, I am so sorry.
Are you kidding?

18:40.034 --> 18:43.201
That's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever done for me.

18:43.201 --> 18:45.934
* Bernadette!
Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!
