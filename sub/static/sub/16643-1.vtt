Oh, you fucking bastards.

Fucking hell.

03:13.768 --> 03:15.737
Oh, fuck.

03:16.707 --> 03:19.942
Ooh.

03:19.944 --> 03:22.511
Oh.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.135
Smile.

03:43.870 --> 03:45.538
Write-off.

04:03.795 --> 04:06.863
You're damn fucking right he won't do it again.

04:20.579 --> 04:22.716
All right?
Enjoying that?

04:24.885 --> 04:28.488
- Fucking hell. - You mess with
my stuff and I'll mess with yours.

04:28.490 --> 04:31.125
- Peter, he's my s--
- I ask you to join this conversation?

04:32.627 --> 04:34.595
Get up. Up.

04:34.597 --> 04:36.497
- Peter.
- You asked me to deal with it,

04:36.499 --> 04:39.635
- So I'm dealing with it.
come on, you. - Mom.

04:39.637 --> 04:42.604
"Mom, Mom." Move.

04:42.606 --> 04:44.140
Get in.

04:53.952 --> 04:55.954
Do you know what goes on in here?

04:55.956 --> 04:58.223
Darts?

05:00.026 --> 05:01.561
Business.

05:01.563 --> 05:05.031
You and me, we're gonna talk business.

05:10.672 --> 05:12.940
Very good for mental arithmetic is darts.

05:12.942 --> 05:14.676
Come here.

05:17.146 --> 05:19.849
- How's your maths, son?
- I ain't your son, Peter.

05:19.851 --> 05:21.784
No, but you are my problem.

05:28.927 --> 05:30.494
Go.

05:39.706 --> 05:43.275
Mercedes Menz C class, £61,000,

05:43.277 --> 05:46.846
Minus one Xbox, £150, equals?

05:46.848 --> 05:48.281
- I don't fucking know.
- Equals?

05:48.283 --> 05:50.551
Shit me!

05:50.553 --> 05:53.153
Uh uh, 20 thousa--

05:53.155 --> 05:57.659
60-- 60,850.

05:57.661 --> 06:01.029
Call it 60. Minimum wage,
18 to 21 years olds is?

06:01.031 --> 06:03.032
Fucking £10 an hour.

06:04.836 --> 06:07.104
You wish. £4.98.
We'll call it four.

06:07.106 --> 06:10.574
Four years at minimum wage, eight hours a day.

06:10.576 --> 06:12.744
That's how long it's gonna take you

06:12.746 --> 06:15.179
to pay me fucking back.

06:17.616 --> 06:20.586
I wouldn't get four years if they
nicked me for it, you know.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.955
Like I said, you're my problem, not theirs.

06:22.957 --> 06:24.690
Yeah, that's only 'cause you don't

06:24.692 --> 06:26.959
want the feds sniffing around
your business, innit?

06:28.095 --> 06:29.563
Innit?

06:37.573 --> 06:41.109
Now what would you know about my business?

06:42.713 --> 06:44.346
Hmm?

06:45.716 --> 06:47.083
Hmm?

06:57.862 --> 07:00.933
Yeah?

07:02.835 --> 07:05.204
Other phone.
Other phone.

07:12.647 --> 07:16.017
Yeah?

07:17.686 --> 07:19.253
Do you know who's doing this?

07:22.392 --> 07:26.062
All right, calm down.
I said calm down.

07:28.633 --> 07:32.002
Yeah, go on. Fuck off, you,
you fucking bully.

07:50.224 --> 07:53.260
Do you know what goes on in here, son?

07:54.329 --> 07:57.332
Fucking business.

07:59.702 --> 08:01.269
What a tit-head.

08:05.442 --> 08:09.245
Oh, fucking hell.

08:27.702 --> 08:29.368
Oh, you dirty bastard.

09:30.774 --> 09:34.345
Oh, my fucking god.

09:34.347 --> 09:36.347
Shit.

09:37.349 --> 09:38.984
Come on.

09:40.118 --> 09:41.520
Come on, you fucking thing.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.536
- You still here?
- Yeah.

09:56.572 --> 09:59.208
You didn't say if we're finished or not.

10:03.547 --> 10:06.349
Should probably start
paying you back today--

10:06.351 --> 10:08.184
Four years and that.

10:08.186 --> 10:11.155
So I could mow the lawn for you if you want.

10:12.290 --> 10:15.426
- Gardner's been.
- Oh, yeah.

10:15.428 --> 10:18.429
And don't say you'll wash the fucking car.

10:19.832 --> 10:22.801
Don't worry. I'll find something
for you to do.

10:24.238 --> 10:25.505
Go.

11:16.565 --> 11:18.600
It's a shit job, isn't it?

11:21.470 --> 11:23.673
I've got something better for you tomorrow.

11:23.675 --> 11:26.209
Oh, don't fucking tell me--
the septic tank?

11:27.277 --> 11:28.711
Come here.

11:44.764 --> 11:46.665
I've been thinking

11:46.667 --> 11:48.735
about the conversation we had earlier.

11:49.937 --> 11:51.871
I think you're right.

11:53.575 --> 11:56.544
I think you should take more responsibility.

11:58.314 --> 11:59.981
A guy I know needs a driver.

12:01.784 --> 12:03.586
Okay.

12:03.588 --> 12:06.389
- Cool.
- Interest you?

12:06.391 --> 12:08.791
Mmm. Why,
what's he drive?

12:09.827 --> 12:11.895
Different jobs, different cars.

12:14.666 --> 12:16.701
His name's Roy.

12:17.969 --> 12:19.771
You'll meet him
tomorrow morning at 6:00.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.707
- 6:00?!
- There's always the septic tank.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.844
Okay, right. Yup.

12:24.846 --> 12:26.379
I'll be there.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.782
Good.

12:29.851 --> 12:31.918
Now listen, uh...

12:34.689 --> 12:37.859
Let's keep this to ourselves, eh?
Just you and me.

12:40.496 --> 12:42.531
I'll sort out your mom.
Don't worry.

12:44.434 --> 12:46.369
Lunch money.

12:47.305 --> 12:48.905
And, Adam...

12:50.875 --> 12:52.609
Don't fuck this up.

13:03.490 --> 13:05.624
Fucking h...

14:01.724 --> 14:03.158
Fucking hell.

14:06.830 --> 14:08.731
Dominating the headlines this morning

14:08.733 --> 14:11.134
the story of another victim
in what the press have dubbed

14:11.136 --> 14:12.936
"The Handyman Murders."

14:12.938 --> 14:16.907
Just north of Newcastle late last night...

14:16.909 --> 14:18.877
Anything else?

14:30.056 --> 14:31.958
9.38 please.

15:14.042 --> 15:15.709
Roy, yeah?

15:30.627 --> 15:33.530
That's the last time I wanna
hear you say my name.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.098
Okay.

15:36.901 --> 15:40.137
What do I call you
instead then? Ray?

15:41.573 --> 15:42.908
Nope.

15:44.042 --> 15:46.245
What's wrong with Ray?
It's not your name.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.117
Ah. Ray, Roy--

15:51.119 --> 15:53.953
It's too similar.
Too easy.

15:58.527 --> 16:00.629
So how do I attract your attention?

16:00.631 --> 16:03.765
Well, it's just me and you in the car.
I'll assume you're talking to me.

16:03.767 --> 16:05.967
Okay, so we go to the services for a bite to eat

16:05.969 --> 16:09.971
I see a truck nearly run you over.
What do I call you then?

16:10.974 --> 16:12.308
Just shout, "OI."

16:13.978 --> 16:15.245
You want me to call you "OI"?

16:18.950 --> 16:21.185
No, okay, yeah.

16:21.187 --> 16:23.154
Roy, oi.

16:24.823 --> 16:27.625
Fair enough. Keys?

16:29.329 --> 16:33.099
Oh-ho.
Right, I'm onto it.

16:33.101 --> 16:35.670
Come on, you fucking...

16:36.905 --> 16:39.006
You should've let me pick you one, man.

16:39.008 --> 16:41.943
Could've got you something much
cooler than this thing.

16:41.945 --> 16:44.079
There we go.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.052
So where we off to?

16:49.054 --> 16:50.853
A14, A1.

16:50.855 --> 16:54.123
Okay, I'll just need a postcode.
Let's get the sat-nav.

16:57.028 --> 16:59.697
A14 west, A1 north.

17:00.799 --> 17:02.267
I'll let you know when we get there.

17:52.126 --> 17:54.193
Do you mind if I stick the radio on, mate?

17:57.198 --> 17:59.199
Where is it?

17:59.201 --> 18:01.669
Police in Northumberland
have released information

18:01.671 --> 18:03.438
regarding the discovery of a body on the A1.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.774
- Oh, the A1. Boom.
- They believe the victim is linked

18:05.776 --> 18:07.142
to a string of murders
that have been happening...

18:07.144 --> 18:09.044
- Uh, testing.
- Which means?

18:09.046 --> 18:11.180
Which means we'll have to start
talking like this, Pet!

18:15.453 --> 18:17.153
Which means cops.

18:18.256 --> 18:20.358
Oh yeah, 'cause of that, um...

18:21.326 --> 18:23.327
Handyman fella.

18:25.765 --> 18:27.298
It's all over the news, isn't it?

18:37.879 --> 18:39.479
What's that you're reading then?

18:39.481 --> 18:42.183
Ooh, a speech.

18:42.185 --> 18:44.351
Is that what you do then,
is it? Make speeches?

18:44.353 --> 18:46.421
I fit kitchens.

18:47.724 --> 18:50.092
You're making a speech about fitting kitchens?

18:52.295 --> 18:55.766
It's a long journey, man.

I can drive with them in.

20:55.641 --> 20:57.508
- Turn it off.
- It's only music.

20:57.510 --> 20:59.242
- Wind your window down.
- What?

20:59.244 --> 21:00.611
Wind your window down!

21:04.451 --> 21:06.685
You got that switched on,
they know exactly where you are.

21:09.489 --> 21:13.226
- It was a birthday present. - Well,
it's you or the phone. It's your choice.

21:17.566 --> 21:20.569
Okay. Can I keep
the headphones?

21:47.034 --> 21:49.268
500 fucking quid.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.444
Stop here.

22:41.196 --> 22:44.599
- Do you need any backup?
- Not to eat my lunch.

22:47.771 --> 22:50.272
- You want some?
- Nah.

22:51.208 --> 22:52.609
Oh, go on then.

23:02.788 --> 23:04.288
Oh, man.

23:05.425 --> 23:08.393
- It's moldy!
- It's cheese.

23:38.630 --> 23:40.698
I don't think I'll be out here again.

23:40.700 --> 23:43.835
Well, you never know with your job.

23:47.173 --> 23:48.807
No, I'm done.

23:50.544 --> 23:51.911
Retiring?

23:55.315 --> 23:57.551
My daughter's getting married.

24:00.722 --> 24:02.723
You know how much a wedding costs these days?

24:09.365 --> 24:11.601
I thought we might be on to something.

24:13.737 --> 24:15.405
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.609
I always wanted to fit kitchens.

24:22.380 --> 24:24.616
Well, it all comes down to the same thing.

24:25.617 --> 24:29.222
Details.
There's your D.N.A.

24:31.558 --> 24:33.860
I knew a guy once,

24:33.862 --> 24:35.795
he got hired on for a job.

24:35.797 --> 24:37.331
It should've been a simple job,

24:37.333 --> 24:41.302
but at a tense moment, he licked his lips.

24:41.304 --> 24:43.337
That's all it took.

24:44.807 --> 24:48.476
They got his D.N.A.
from saliva on his ski mask.

24:48.478 --> 24:50.512
With that, they could put him at the job.

24:50.514 --> 24:53.582
And if they could put him at the job,
then they could put other people at the job.

24:53.584 --> 24:56.385
- So that was that.
- What, they did him in?

24:58.522 --> 24:59.757
What I'm saying is

24:59.759 --> 25:01.859
for a guy to get along in this world,

25:03.829 --> 25:05.830
he has to be very very careful.

25:07.734 --> 25:10.769
- Same goes with your dad.
- No, he's not my dad.

25:10.771 --> 25:13.939
What do you call him then?
The guy that screws your mom?

25:46.880 --> 25:48.547
Fuck.

25:48.549 --> 25:49.781
Ah!

26:41.609 --> 26:43.778
Are you gonna tell me what we're up to?

26:46.882 --> 26:49.618
- Right, you can stay here.
- Oh, man.

26:49.620 --> 26:51.085
You keep an eye out.
All right?

26:51.087 --> 26:53.422
If someone comes along,
pretend you're walking your dog.

26:53.424 --> 26:54.990
- All right? Shout "Rover."
- Rover?

26:54.992 --> 26:56.860
Yeah. What?

26:56.862 --> 26:58.896
It's just not very believable,

26:58.898 --> 27:01.866
Guy like me with a dog called Rover.

27:01.868 --> 27:03.700
All right, you choose a name.

27:03.702 --> 27:05.069
Psycho.

27:06.906 --> 27:08.172
Psycho.

27:08.174 --> 27:11.778
Yeah, mate of mine in sinfin
calls his staff that.

27:12.712 --> 27:13.812
It's a detail.

27:14.782 --> 27:16.015
Right.

27:17.885 --> 27:20.487
Right. You just keep
a lookout. Shit!

27:43.816 --> 27:47.685
You ain't gonna do much damage
with that, are ya?

28:07.878 --> 28:11.213
Mr. Eglitis? I appreciate
that you're scared.

28:12.515 --> 28:14.716
- Do not come in!
- Right.

28:14.718 --> 28:16.986
I'm gonna put something through the door.

28:16.988 --> 28:20.557
- I'm Newcastle police.
- It's not me you want!

28:20.559 --> 28:22.692
We know your life's been threatened.

28:22.694 --> 28:25.797
We think you might be #4, Danil.

28:25.799 --> 28:27.030
Can I call you Danil?

28:27.633 --> 28:29.568
That's why I'm here.

28:29.570 --> 28:32.304
We want to take you into protective custody.

28:35.642 --> 28:37.677
Why don't you come out and talk to me?

28:56.167 --> 28:57.433
You all right?

28:57.435 --> 28:59.603
Are we good?

28:59.605 --> 29:01.771
Can I stand up now?

29:08.548 --> 29:11.884
Now the car is parked up there on the track.

29:11.886 --> 29:16.189
Do wanna walk with me, or do you
wanna wait here and I'll go fetch it?

29:16.191 --> 29:17.557
I'll walk.

29:22.330 --> 29:24.698
- Psycho!
- You're not cop.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.368
Psycho!

29:26.370 --> 29:28.169
Oh!

29:28.171 --> 29:30.739
- How many?
- Eh?

29:30.741 --> 29:34.744
- How many were there?
- Uh...

29:34.746 --> 29:37.413
- You did see someone, right?
- I thought so.

29:37.415 --> 29:38.748
Get the car.

29:40.218 --> 29:42.653
- Are you gonna do him in?
- Get the fucking car!

30:22.434 --> 30:24.602
Hey, sorry about the false alarm.

30:24.604 --> 30:26.837
It's all right.

30:28.774 --> 30:32.712
It's probably better to be a little
bit further off the track.

30:46.395 --> 30:47.795
Give us a go?

30:49.865 --> 30:52.400
"Give us a go"?

30:52.402 --> 30:53.869
Yeah, when ya...

30:56.673 --> 30:57.907
Can I...

31:01.579 --> 31:03.648
Could be the only chance I ever get.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.768
- Here.
- What about the gun?

31:28.871 --> 31:30.706
- He doesn't use one.
- He does.

31:31.641 --> 31:32.941
Did.

31:32.943 --> 31:35.577
No. no, not him.

31:36.880 --> 31:39.750
You cut it off, right?

31:39.752 --> 31:42.453
You cut it off right here.

31:42.455 --> 31:43.788
- You?
- Me what?

31:43.790 --> 31:46.958
- You're the handyman?
- What?

31:46.960 --> 31:48.827
No! No, no, no, no, no.

31:48.829 --> 31:51.897
No no, He's supposed to look
like just another victim,

31:51.899 --> 31:53.832
you know, so it doesn't get traced back to me.

31:56.037 --> 31:59.873
So just here.
All right?

32:02.377 --> 32:03.744
On you go.

32:07.617 --> 32:09.385
See on his hand?
Look, it says "Mate."

32:09.387 --> 32:10.818
No, it doesn't say "Mate."

32:10.820 --> 32:12.955
It says "Mom" and "Dad" in Latvian.

32:12.957 --> 32:14.791
- Latvian? - That's what
they speak in Latvia.

32:14.793 --> 32:16.658
Are you gonna do this or what?

32:28.840 --> 32:31.443
Try not to look in his eyes,

32:31.445 --> 32:32.944
so you don't identify with him.

32:32.946 --> 32:34.981
Well, it's a bit odd not to.

32:36.049 --> 32:37.149
Well...

32:40.890 --> 32:42.823
Think...

32:42.825 --> 32:44.959
Of something that you hate.

32:44.961 --> 32:48.863
Something that you hate so much

32:48.865 --> 32:50.932
that you'd be willing to kill it.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.853
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:08.855 --> 33:11.056
No, no, no, up a bit.

33:11.058 --> 33:13.926
Up a bit, up a bit.

33:13.928 --> 33:15.929
Right. right there. Bang on.

33:25.207 --> 33:27.541
Oh, man, what's that?

33:27.543 --> 33:28.944
Oh!

33:33.049 --> 33:34.950
Muscles relax when you die.

33:34.952 --> 33:37.987
- So he shat himself?
- Yeah, I must've hit him too hard.

33:37.989 --> 33:39.689
Still...

33:40.858 --> 33:42.925
- Job done, eh?
- No, no, no, here.

33:42.927 --> 33:45.128
The wounds aren't supposed to be postmortem.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.037
Oh!

33:55.042 --> 33:56.208
Not on the ground.

33:59.847 --> 34:02.015
Oh, man.

34:14.697 --> 34:15.931
Here ya are.

34:17.902 --> 34:19.902
- Huh?
- Grab this.

34:22.706 --> 34:25.175
Oh, fuck.

34:28.713 --> 34:31.049
Why don't you go and keep an eye out?

34:31.051 --> 34:32.317
Just like before.

34:33.553 --> 34:35.554
Not in that outfit!

34:35.556 --> 34:36.955
Oh, yeah.

34:38.958 --> 34:41.694
Sick bastard.

34:41.696 --> 34:42.929
Right.

35:08.126 --> 35:09.994
Good afternoon, darling.

35:15.935 --> 35:17.837
It's not as ugly as it looks.

35:19.206 --> 35:22.876
Deer in these forests are protected,

35:22.878 --> 35:24.811
so you gotta butcher them on the spot.

35:24.813 --> 35:26.814
And what with the roads
around here--

35:26.816 --> 35:29.183
They don't always get where they're going,

35:29.185 --> 35:32.087
- Especially the older ones.
- Mmm.

35:33.889 --> 35:37.125
We're just trying to make a living, really.

35:37.127 --> 35:39.895
Restaurants around here,
they pay 10 quid a kilo,

35:39.897 --> 35:41.964
Some of 'em.

35:41.966 --> 35:43.934
So I'll tell you what we're gonna do:

35:43.936 --> 35:47.638
We're gonna pack up and you're
gonna go on your way.

35:48.941 --> 35:51.943
And then I'll give you a nice little something

35:51.945 --> 35:54.979
for the campfire tonight, all right?

35:56.116 --> 35:57.383
Oi!

36:02.857 --> 36:05.125
Now no one needs to get hurt.

36:06.060 --> 36:09.163
Now my friend here is gonna come over to you

36:09.165 --> 36:12.200
And he's gonna relieve you of your rucksack.

36:15.338 --> 36:17.406
Well, go on.
What are you waiting for?

36:18.741 --> 36:20.176
Off you go.

36:58.321 --> 36:59.723
Right.

36:59.725 --> 37:01.390
Oh, god!

37:06.764 --> 37:09.266
Just trying to make it easier on you.

37:14.139 --> 37:16.975
I'm sorry about this, darling.

37:33.028 --> 37:35.263
You said you wanted to kill someone.

37:36.298 --> 37:38.100
Now's your chance.

37:40.437 --> 37:42.438
Can't we just tie her up somewhere?

37:43.374 --> 37:45.274
Oh, jesus!

38:22.820 --> 38:24.587
Get the bag!

38:27.325 --> 38:29.193
This is why I work alone.

38:33.131 --> 38:35.266
Not that bag, the other one.

38:48.416 --> 38:50.351
Oh.

39:00.897 --> 39:02.398
If we get caught, yeah,

39:02.400 --> 39:04.433
Will they think we did all three?

39:04.435 --> 39:07.371
You've got alibis for the other two, have you?

39:16.982 --> 39:19.084
All right, bend over like you're in pain.

39:19.086 --> 39:21.219
Do what?

39:21.221 --> 39:24.090
- For fuck's sake!
- No, stay down.

39:25.059 --> 39:26.459
God.

39:30.498 --> 39:33.334
Have you seen a red car go by here, fast?

39:33.336 --> 39:34.501
Yeah.

39:34.503 --> 39:37.538
Bastard hit my son.
He didn't even stop.

39:37.540 --> 39:38.674
Oh, my god.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.413
is he okay?

39:44.415 --> 39:47.183
He's never really been okay.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.619
- Could you get in the back?
- Eh?

39:49.621 --> 39:51.255
In the back. Go on.

39:52.490 --> 39:55.092
In you go.
You all right to drive?

39:55.094 --> 39:56.527
Uh-huh.

39:57.930 --> 40:01.300
Fucking hell.

40:08.042 --> 40:09.609
There's no rush.

40:21.291 --> 40:22.658
- Other way.
- Huh?

40:22.660 --> 40:25.161
They just passed her.
Other way.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.673
Well, which way now?

40:37.443 --> 40:40.278
- Do you have a phone?
- In my bag.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.649
All right, out you get.

40:48.557 --> 40:50.557
What the fuck are you waiting for?

40:56.431 --> 40:59.167
- So how do we know which
way she went? - We don't.

40:59.169 --> 41:01.403
How are we gonna fucking find her then?

41:05.476 --> 41:07.343
Pull over.
I need to use the phone.

41:07.345 --> 41:08.711
You've got a phone in your hand.

41:10.682 --> 41:12.516
Here.

41:12.518 --> 41:14.452
And turn the fucking seat around.

41:43.087 --> 41:44.822
Is it Adam?

41:46.959 --> 41:48.426
It's business.

41:56.035 --> 41:57.904
Well, I did wonder.

41:59.573 --> 42:01.407
Okay, got it.

42:15.659 --> 42:17.260
Oi, don't be mad.

42:19.229 --> 42:21.163
My phone is still in the Granada.

42:24.402 --> 42:26.403
Side pocket, mate.

42:35.682 --> 42:37.450
What's your number?

42:39.152 --> 42:41.021
Oi, what's your number?

42:41.023 --> 42:42.489
I don't know.

42:43.391 --> 42:45.493
Well, who rings themselves up?

42:46.527 --> 42:49.430
Well, do you know anybody's number?

42:49.432 --> 42:51.432
Somebody who might have your number?

42:51.434 --> 42:53.669
- Yeah, my mom's.
- All right, call her.

43:05.015 --> 43:06.517
Hiya, mom.

43:07.485 --> 43:09.420
Yeah.
No, I can't talk.

43:09.422 --> 43:11.556
I just need me number.

43:13.292 --> 43:15.193
No, I haven't lost it, no.

43:16.163 --> 43:18.097
Oh, mom!

43:18.099 --> 43:21.368
Just give him the fucking number.

43:22.336 --> 43:25.038
Hiya. okay, right.
I need a pen.

43:32.448 --> 43:34.583
Three, one, double eight.

43:34.585 --> 43:36.719
All right, mom.
Yup, I'll be back later on.

43:36.721 --> 43:40.389
Yeah, I promise.
Okay okay, bye.

43:40.391 --> 43:42.125
Call it.

43:43.627 --> 43:46.364
Double eight.

43:53.072 --> 43:56.208
Don't hang up.

43:56.211 --> 43:58.210
Listen to me very carefully.

43:58.212 --> 44:01.581
You have something of ours and I want it back.

44:02.783 --> 44:06.119
It's not the car.
It's not the phone.

44:06.121 --> 44:08.255
It's the bag.

44:08.257 --> 44:10.357
All right, you give me the bag back,

44:10.359 --> 44:12.193
I'll give you five grand in cash.

44:12.195 --> 44:14.496
Now there's a diner just south of you.

44:14.498 --> 44:16.564
We can be there in 15 minutes.

44:17.567 --> 44:19.468
You give me the bag.
I'll give you the cash.

44:19.470 --> 44:20.736
You go your way.
I'll go mine.

44:20.738 --> 44:22.572
10,000.

44:24.375 --> 44:25.509
7,000...

44:26.644 --> 44:28.512
And I'll need 20 minutes.

44:28.514 --> 44:30.481
You have 10.

44:33.452 --> 44:35.521
- She knew him.
- Huh?

44:35.523 --> 44:37.756
Her accent-- she knew him.

44:37.758 --> 44:40.193
How fast can you make this thing go?

45:25.880 --> 45:28.883
Pull over here.
We're a bit short.

45:30.551 --> 45:34.121
Now you keep an eye on her till I get back.

45:35.190 --> 45:38.127
If she tries to leave, block her in.

45:40.331 --> 45:41.898
This should buy us some time.

45:44.401 --> 45:45.803
What are you gonna do?

45:45.805 --> 45:49.640
- Block her if she tries to leave, man.
- All right.

45:52.377 --> 45:53.678

50:24.627 --> 50:26.930
It's not for everyone, son.

50:27.897 --> 50:28.998
Huh?

50:29.967 --> 50:31.635
The life.

50:32.770 --> 50:34.772
Oh no, that was only 'cause she was a girl.

50:34.774 --> 50:36.907
What happened with the guy then?

50:37.843 --> 50:39.611
Already dead.

50:50.023 --> 50:52.092
Aren't we going home now?

50:52.927 --> 50:55.662
We need to change cars.

50:55.664 --> 50:58.699
Okay. well, will you let me
pick this time, please?

51:00.002 --> 51:01.804
I know my cars, me.

51:11.815 --> 51:13.183
You can choose.

51:44.788 --> 51:47.322
What the fuck's your problem then, eh, dog?

51:47.324 --> 51:49.191
Eh?

51:51.929 --> 51:53.630
Hey, what's up?

51:54.699 --> 51:56.833
You're worried about us fucking up?

51:59.138 --> 52:00.939
No.

52:01.874 --> 52:03.242
I'll be gone tomorrow.

52:03.244 --> 52:05.109
Where are you off to?

52:07.047 --> 52:10.817
Oh, come on. We're like partners
in crime now, you know.

52:15.156 --> 52:16.891
Are you going on your own?

52:18.827 --> 52:20.796
Sounds fucking lonely to me, that does, mate.

52:20.798 --> 52:23.030
What, you wanna come visit me, do you?

52:23.032 --> 52:26.102
Yeah. Yeah.

52:28.104 --> 52:30.206
Always wanted to go traveling.

52:49.196 --> 52:51.198
I don't see no cars, Roy.

52:54.168 --> 52:56.704
It's all right, isn't it, to call you Roy now?

52:58.841 --> 53:01.943
|Yeah. Yeah.

53:02.945 --> 53:03.678
It's okay.

53:08.218 --> 53:12.789
So we got one more thing to deal with.

53:20.732 --> 53:22.300
We gotta get rid of this.

53:22.302 --> 53:25.437
Uh-huh. Attention to detail.

53:42.958 --> 53:45.161
Where'd you pick all this stuff up then?

53:46.295 --> 53:48.130
Angola.

53:49.834 --> 53:53.003
- What, in Spain?
- Yeah, that's right, in Spain.

53:54.105 --> 53:55.739
Why don't you dig a little hole?

53:56.474 --> 53:59.209
- Yeah?
- Yup.

54:32.216 --> 54:34.150
- Like that?
- Yeah, like that.

57:23.517 --> 57:26.218
Shit. Ah!

57:29.923 --> 57:32.592
Oh, jesus. Shit.

57:33.761 --> 57:35.562
Oh, shit.

57:40.736 --> 57:41.770
Oh.

57:53.685 --> 57:55.685
Oh, shit!

58:05.631 --> 58:08.466
- Why did you kill him?
- Huh?

58:09.436 --> 58:10.970
Why did you kill him?

58:12.773 --> 58:14.408
I didn't kill no one.

58:14.410 --> 58:15.709
Danil is dead.

58:16.679 --> 58:18.478
I needed him to be alive.

58:18.480 --> 58:20.682
I needed him to give me a name.
Now you must tell me.

58:20.684 --> 58:22.717
Fucking hell.

58:24.854 --> 58:27.590
Have you seen her?

58:30.594 --> 58:33.463
Huh-uh. No.

58:35.766 --> 58:37.868
It's my sister.

58:39.905 --> 58:42.441
Sergei sold her to Ivan.

58:42.443 --> 58:44.242
Ivan sold her to Danil.

58:44.244 --> 58:45.877
Danil sold her to an englishman.

58:45.879 --> 58:47.714
You will tell me his name.

58:47.716 --> 58:50.750
- You will tell me his name.
- I'm just the fucking driver.

58:50.752 --> 58:53.786
- You like pain?
- Ah! Fucking no!

58:55.924 --> 58:57.625
Fucking hell.

59:16.748 --> 59:19.716
Okay.
Just fucking chill out.

59:28.962 --> 59:30.797
You want to touch me?

59:32.900 --> 59:34.367
Huh?

59:35.303 --> 59:36.870
Men like to touch.

59:36.872 --> 59:38.639
Fucking...

59:41.743 --> 59:43.645
Touch.

01:00:06.506 --> 01:00:08.708
Oh, what the fucking hell?

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.076
They put their hands on her.

01:00:10.078 --> 01:00:12.545
Before they died, each one gave me a name,

01:00:12.547 --> 01:00:14.114
The next man in the chain.

01:00:14.116 --> 01:00:16.082
- This is why you killed Danil...
- No.

01:00:16.084 --> 01:00:18.886
- ...So he cannot tell.
- No, I'm just a kid.

01:00:19.855 --> 01:00:20.954
I'm 19.

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:23.791
Fucking hell.

01:00:23.793 --> 01:00:25.360
Your friend then.

01:00:25.362 --> 01:00:26.729
Friend?

01:00:26.731 --> 01:00:28.664
The man you were with today.

01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:29.932
Roy?

01:00:34.372 --> 01:00:36.005
His name is Roy.

01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:40.878
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:01:01.536 --> 01:01:03.705
Fuck.

01:01:26.131 --> 01:01:27.966
Right.

01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:02.973
- Hello?
- I need to speak with Peter.

01:02:02.975 --> 01:02:06.511
- He's asleep.
- Well, wake him up.

01:02:08.915 --> 01:02:11.984
- I can't do that.
- Yeah, you can.

01:02:11.986 --> 01:02:13.954
Tell him it's about the kitchen.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.163
Someone's on the phone.
He says it's about the kitchen.

01:02:26.001 --> 01:02:27.668
Not on this phone.

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:29.271
Don't hang up.
We have a problem.

01:02:32.675 --> 01:02:35.078
Are you sure you got to him before he talked?

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.713
The Latvian's not the problem.

01:02:36.715 --> 01:02:38.615
What do you mean he's not the problem?

01:02:38.617 --> 01:02:40.950
He's the one that can put me in this.

01:02:40.952 --> 01:02:42.720
It's the boy.

01:02:43.655 --> 01:02:46.658
- He lost his phone.
- So?

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.927
Well, we need it back.
Trust me.

01:02:48.929 --> 01:02:50.262
I thought I could.

01:02:50.264 --> 01:02:52.932
Can you locate it?

01:02:52.934 --> 01:02:54.934
Oh, so now you're being thorough.

01:02:54.936 --> 01:02:58.038
And if you double my fee, I can take care

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.041
of that little chain supply
problem you've been having.

01:03:02.077 --> 01:03:03.977
You have an idea who's doing this?

01:03:03.979 --> 01:03:06.014
We're on the phone.
Remember?

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.083
I want it sorted.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.621
Someone'll give you a call.

01:03:33.047 --> 01:03:35.148
You got a pen?

01:04:01.746 --> 01:04:04.715
If I find one of her,
I will know you lied to me.

01:04:05.818 --> 01:04:08.087
Ivan had photos too.

01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:09.687
I don't know why it is

01:04:09.689 --> 01:04:12.658
when man does something bad

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.294
he likes to keep a souvenir.

01:04:22.103 --> 01:04:25.306
This man-- Sergei and Ivan
had him too. Who is he?

01:04:26.274 --> 01:04:28.109
- What about him?
- Who is he?!

01:04:30.912 --> 01:04:32.714
I don't know him.

01:04:32.716 --> 01:04:34.217
I don't know the guy.

01:04:35.318 --> 01:04:37.053
He's not even supposed to be in the photo.

01:04:37.055 --> 01:04:38.354
Look, I'm taking a photo of my mom.

01:04:38.356 --> 01:04:40.223
- You know him.
- Nah.

01:04:40.225 --> 01:04:42.292
Look, you can't even fucking see his face.

01:04:42.294 --> 01:04:43.861
Look, nobody knows him.

01:04:43.863 --> 01:04:46.163
You don't even know who it is.

01:04:46.165 --> 01:04:47.432
Help!

01:05:53.174 --> 01:05:54.975
Fuck's sake.

01:05:55.945 --> 01:05:57.379
Fucking hell!

01:05:59.348 --> 01:06:01.083
Fuck off!

01:06:06.324 --> 01:06:09.426
Whoa!

01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:34.557
Fuck's sake!

01:06:47.206 --> 01:06:49.541
Easy.

01:06:49.543 --> 01:06:52.511
- You kill me, he'll kill you.
- Roy'll kill me?

01:06:52.513 --> 01:06:55.582
- He already tried.
- She's fucking with you, son.

01:06:55.584 --> 01:06:57.717
- Whoa! I want to hear it.
- How did you get here?

01:06:59.353 --> 01:07:01.789
- We stopped the van.
- He hit you.

01:07:06.429 --> 01:07:09.331
We stopped the van to change cars.
That's what you said.

01:07:11.335 --> 01:07:13.703
There weren't no fucking cars, Roy.

01:07:13.705 --> 01:07:16.306
- You were gonna kill me?
- Give him to me.

01:07:16.308 --> 01:07:18.475
One more and it's finished.

01:07:18.477 --> 01:07:21.245
Yeah, she thinks you killed her sister as well.

01:07:21.247 --> 01:07:23.548
I haven't killed a woman since 1983.

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.352
Who hired you?

01:07:28.655 --> 01:07:30.522
Why don't you ask him?

01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:33.426
Yo! I'm the one
with a fucking gun here!

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:37.664
Stop!

01:07:37.666 --> 01:07:39.299
Stop!

01:07:41.537 --> 01:07:43.537
You've only got one left.

01:07:43.539 --> 01:07:45.540
No, that's four.
I'm counting.

01:07:45.542 --> 01:07:46.608
It only holds five.

01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:50.112
Then you should've fucking let me use it on her!

01:07:50.114 --> 01:07:51.548
You're a lousy shot.

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:54.384
Do you want to bet your
fucking life on that, Roy?

01:08:03.628 --> 01:08:04.830
Oh, man.

01:08:06.631 --> 01:08:08.500
Shit, Roy. You need
a hospital, man, fast.

01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:10.102
Just get me to the church.

01:08:10.104 --> 01:08:11.603
What, do you want a priest?

01:08:11.605 --> 01:08:14.707
No, my daughter's getting
married today, you idiot.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.615
Was you really gonna do me in?

01:08:26.423 --> 01:08:28.790
What, 'cause I fucked up the job?

01:08:29.725 --> 01:08:31.593
No, you were the job.

01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:34.196
I'm 19!

01:08:34.198 --> 01:08:36.832
Who the fuck's gonna take a contract out on me?!

01:08:49.814 --> 01:08:51.649
'Cause of the car?

01:08:51.652 --> 01:08:54.353
They don't give me a reason.
They just give me a name.

01:09:01.363 --> 01:09:02.763
The laptop.

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:07.701
- Fuck me.
- Look...

01:09:09.639 --> 01:09:11.907
If you're not going to help,
just fucking shoot me

01:09:11.908 --> 01:09:14.676
before I bleed to death.
Don't forget your phone.

01:09:14.679 --> 01:09:18.215
- What, can I keep it? - Well,
you're the one with the gun. You tell me.

01:09:34.301 --> 01:09:36.636
- There's clothes in the van.
- Down the track?

01:09:36.638 --> 01:09:38.705
Your turn to be lookout.

01:09:46.481 --> 01:09:48.649
My briefcase still in there?

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:49.984
Yeah!

01:09:49.987 --> 01:09:52.688
She left the money as well!

01:10:45.284 --> 01:10:46.851
Music...

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:52.958
You like cuban, don't ya?

01:11:28.901 --> 01:11:30.602
Here.

01:11:37.444 --> 01:11:38.878
Watch...

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.881
And learn, my friend.

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:19.959
I could've killed you back there.

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:21.628
Yeah?

01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:24.631
Why didn't ya?

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:31.439
For the same reason you couldn't kill the girl.

01:12:35.545 --> 01:12:36.846
What?

01:12:36.848 --> 01:12:38.614
It was 'cause I fancied her.

01:12:38.616 --> 01:12:40.116
That's why I couldn't do it.

01:12:43.454 --> 01:12:46.023
You've got a second chance.
You should take it.

01:12:46.025 --> 01:12:48.159
So my mom's boyfriend tries to get me killed,

01:12:48.161 --> 01:12:50.429
I'm supposed to just walk away, am I?

01:12:50.431 --> 01:12:51.896
He thinks you're dead.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.067
Best leave it that way.

01:13:42.256 --> 01:13:44.090
You all right, mate?

01:14:17.998 --> 01:14:19.865
Here.

01:14:23.003 --> 01:14:24.838
Get rid of the car.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.141
The gun and the phone go in the river.

01:14:30.679 --> 01:14:32.813
Everything else burns.

01:14:35.151 --> 01:14:36.818
Attaboy.

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:53.038
Oh, man.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.906
The state of you.

01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:59.244
- Are we going in?
- No, no.

01:14:59.246 --> 01:15:00.913
Just-- just stay over there.

01:15:02.016 --> 01:15:04.685
- Do you want your jacket?
- No.

01:15:04.687 --> 01:15:06.153
No, I'm good.

01:15:06.155 --> 01:15:08.021
She's always on me to wear a bit more color.

01:15:08.023 --> 01:15:10.091
- Here.
- Oh, here?

01:15:10.093 --> 01:15:11.892
Who's that, your wife?

01:15:13.095 --> 01:15:14.295
No, my daughter.

01:15:14.297 --> 01:15:19.134
- How old's your daughter then?
- Don't get any funny ideas, all right?

01:15:29.614 --> 01:15:33.085
- Do you want me to stick around?
- No, you're all right.

01:15:35.688 --> 01:15:37.623
You're a dead man.

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:41.027
You'd better get buried, mate.

01:15:42.763 --> 01:15:44.163
Oi.

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.702
Do us another one
of your roll-ups.

01:16:05.222 --> 01:16:08.158
