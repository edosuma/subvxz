WEBVTT

00:00.602 --> 00:02.812
Come on, get in the car...
Family breakfast.

00:02.903 --> 00:05.593
Mom, I have to practice
my squat jumps for volleyball.

00:05.711 --> 00:08.278
Your what? Oh, good Lord.

00:08.347 --> 00:10.940
If I did that, Anna-Kat wouldn't wouldn't
be the only one peeing in the yard.

00:11.183 --> 00:12.838
Get in the car.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.892
Oh, and we have to stop by Office Depot.

00:14.954 --> 00:17.371
I need to make some posters for
the school's recycling drive...

00:17.473 --> 00:19.756
- chairman.
- You can start by recycling

00:19.825 --> 00:22.759
that stupid blue bag
from The New York Times

00:22.828 --> 00:24.595
that you leave next to
the toilet every day.

00:24.663 --> 00:26.797
- Do I have to go?
- Yes!

00:26.865 --> 00:30.500
I want a fun family outing.
Now get in the car.

00:30.569 --> 00:32.803
Mom, we talked about the sweat pants...

00:32.871 --> 00:35.019
Westporters get dressed
to go out in public.

00:35.044 --> 00:36.109
We're not Westporters.

00:36.134 --> 00:37.574
We are renters who live in Westport.

00:37.643 --> 00:40.177
It is a small distinction,
but I cling to it.

00:40.245 --> 00:43.447
Now, get in the car.

00:45.384 --> 00:47.651
Mama, I found this on the windshield.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.233
A "concerned" neighbor thinks

00:49.258 --> 00:51.920
we should get the dent
in our minivan fixed.

00:52.057 --> 00:54.491
It's sullying the neighborhood.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.293
And look at that... unsigned.

00:56.362 --> 01:00.063
There's something very wrong
with this place.

01:00.132 --> 01:02.933
Coward!

01:14.171 --> 01:16.711
Anna-Kat, the weird-versus-cute ratio

01:16.781 --> 01:18.448
is getting way out of whack.

01:18.517 --> 01:19.678
Don't talk to your sister like that.

01:19.703 --> 01:21.118
She's always embarrassing me.

01:21.186 --> 01:23.286
You should see how she walks
down the hall at school.

01:27.493 --> 01:30.594
Hey, isn't that your sister?

01:30.662 --> 01:35.198
Yeah. She's feral.
We found her in the woods.

01:35.267 --> 01:37.868
I don't care if she's setting
the teachers' lounge on fire.

01:37.936 --> 01:40.337
You're her brother,
and you need to have her back.

01:40.405 --> 01:41.512
<i>And just in case...</i>

01:41.537 --> 01:44.305
I actually do care if you set
the teachers' lounge on fire.

01:44.777 --> 01:46.810
- Mnh-mnh!
- No cellphones.

01:46.879 --> 01:47.878
I have rights.

01:47.946 --> 01:49.813
Isn't that cute?

01:49.882 --> 01:51.047
No, you don't.

01:51.116 --> 01:53.884
Whoever told you that
is not helping you.

01:53.952 --> 01:55.218
I am in charge,

01:55.287 --> 01:57.387
and we are going to have
a low-tech family breakfast

01:57.412 --> 01:59.022
like we used to do back home.

01:59.047 --> 02:00.557
Westport is our home.
We're not visiting.

02:00.626 --> 02:03.160
You know, I saw on Facebook that
everyone from our old cul-de-sac

02:03.228 --> 02:04.694
got together
for the annual kickball game.

02:04.763 --> 02:07.409
Carl made that punch in a trash
can that he always brings.

02:07.434 --> 02:08.497
What's that stuff called?

02:08.567 --> 02:10.292
- Trash Can Punch.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

02:10.384 --> 02:12.936
They didn't even think to invite us.

02:13.005 --> 02:14.371
Because we don't live there anymore.

02:14.439 --> 02:16.706
We still kind of live there.

02:16.775 --> 02:19.476
In no way, shape, or form
do we live there.

02:19.545 --> 02:22.045
That's why I said "kind of."

02:22.114 --> 02:23.480
I'm bored.

02:23.549 --> 02:26.082
Okay, let's play a family game.
I Spy. Who wants to go first?

02:26.151 --> 02:27.551
I'd love to go first.

02:27.619 --> 02:28.952
Oh!

02:29.021 --> 02:32.389
I spy Alice coming in,
and I spy you in sweat pants,

02:32.457 --> 02:35.458
so I spy me going over to her.

02:35.527 --> 02:37.894
It's "I spy with my little eye"!

02:37.963 --> 02:44.367
Oh! I spy with my little eye the
girls from the volleyball team.

02:44.436 --> 02:46.603
I Spy is really
bringing this family together.

02:46.672 --> 02:48.471
Why don't they want to eat with us?

02:48.540 --> 02:50.073
You should be happy
they're making friends.

02:50.142 --> 02:51.975
Yeah, Westport friends.

02:52.044 --> 02:54.211
Look at them...
They're probably talking about

02:54.279 --> 02:56.379
their Christmas vacation
in Turks and Caicos.

02:56.448 --> 02:59.783
I am angry that I even know
what Turks and Caicos is now.

02:59.852 --> 03:01.172
And look at Taylor and her friends...

03:01.266 --> 03:03.653
They are splitting a muffin
four ways. Why?

03:03.722 --> 03:06.623
Because this town muffin shames
women, and it starts early.

03:06.692 --> 03:08.959
I just wanted to do something
as a family,

03:09.027 --> 03:10.927
and this town is getting in our way.

03:13.432 --> 03:14.798
Can I have some cream?

03:14.867 --> 03:17.000
Soy, almond, cashew, or lactose-free?

03:17.069 --> 03:18.468
Mnh-mnh. Half-and-half.

03:18.537 --> 03:20.136
Half almond, half soy?

03:20.205 --> 03:22.439
No. Half milk, half fatter milk.

03:22.507 --> 03:24.841
Oh, I'm sorry.
We stopped carrying cream.

03:24.910 --> 03:27.911
Nobody wants it, because
it's very unhealthy for you.

03:27.980 --> 03:30.447
No... This was not the day to say that.

03:30.515 --> 03:33.801
I want cream and other normal stuff.

03:33.887 --> 03:35.485
I object to gluten-free pancakes,

03:35.554 --> 03:37.487
turkey bacon, and almond soy milk!

03:37.556 --> 03:38.889
I want real milk.

03:38.957 --> 03:42.158
Why can't any of you in this
town be normal and regular?

03:42.227 --> 03:43.727
And why can't any of you

03:43.795 --> 03:47.397
drink cocktails out of a trash
can like the rest of America?!

03:47.466 --> 03:49.032
Huh?!

03:55.474 --> 03:57.173
This might be why they don't
want to eat with us.

04:00.178 --> 04:03.280
Well, that about wraps up the
popular phase of our childhood.

04:03.348 --> 04:05.248
The cream was my last straw.

04:05.317 --> 04:07.250
Now I get why Fat Pam moved away.

04:07.319 --> 04:08.685
I wonder what her last straw was.

04:08.754 --> 04:10.921
Maybe she got her arm stuck
in one of those tiny blouses

04:10.989 --> 04:13.056
that they sell on Main Street
and couldn't get it out.

04:13.125 --> 04:15.091
Then the seam split,
she had to roll it up in a ball,

04:15.160 --> 04:16.192
hide it in her pants,

04:16.261 --> 04:17.694
and then throw it out
in the ladies' room.

04:17.762 --> 04:20.128
I'm worried about
how specific that example was.

04:20.190 --> 04:23.300
No bright-siding it...
We just don't fit in,

04:23.368 --> 04:26.202
and I haven't liked it
since the minute we got here.

04:27.590 --> 04:30.806
_

04:34.746 --> 04:38.715
I love it! I have such
a good feeling about this!

04:38.784 --> 04:40.283
Hello!

04:40.352 --> 04:42.599
Hi! I'm Katie.

04:42.701 --> 04:44.599
- Ah, nice to meet you.
- This is my husband, Greg.

04:44.677 --> 04:45.652
- Hello.
- Hello.

04:45.691 --> 04:46.923
And this is Taylor and Oliver.

04:46.992 --> 04:48.758
Hi. You play volleyball?

04:48.827 --> 04:50.927
- Yes.
- Westport Unified has a great team.

04:50.996 --> 04:53.029
Oh, good to know.

04:53.098 --> 04:56.466
I played when I went there...
State champions, 1956.

04:56.535 --> 04:58.501
Yeah, but do you have a Quidditch team?

04:58.570 --> 05:00.904
Oliver's going through a very
intense Harry Potter phase.

05:00.973 --> 05:02.405
We still like him,
but it's been a struggle.

05:02.474 --> 05:04.140
Come on in. I'll show you the place.

05:04.209 --> 05:05.575
You two go wait in the car.

05:05.644 --> 05:08.645
To Platform 9 3/4!

05:10.315 --> 05:12.669
That Lemony Snicket phase is looking
pretty good right about now.

05:12.694 --> 05:14.384
- They can come in.
- Oh, no.

05:14.453 --> 05:15.809
Our youngest daughter
Anna-Kat is in the car.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.388
She is afraid of strangers,
lawns, and germs.

05:18.457 --> 05:20.323
We're actually moving to
Westport to help her...

05:20.392 --> 05:22.125
...so hopefully she'll be
rolling around your lawn

05:22.194 --> 05:23.493
covered with germs with a stranger.

05:23.562 --> 05:25.962
Okay! Well, come on in.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.000
So, that's it.

05:31.670 --> 05:34.637
It's really nice, but I don't know.

05:34.706 --> 05:36.373
It's a little out of our price range.

05:36.441 --> 05:38.402
Maybe we should look at other towns.

05:38.427 --> 05:40.301
- You see like down-to-Earth people.
- We are.

05:40.418 --> 05:42.686
We're very respectful
of the laws of gravity.

05:42.748 --> 05:44.214
He makes jokes like that.

05:44.282 --> 05:46.916
I like you two.

05:46.985 --> 05:48.151
If you're interested,

05:48.220 --> 05:50.982
I'll figure out a way to make it work.

05:53.278 --> 05:54.717
Well, thank...

05:54.778 --> 05:55.873
Thank you very...

05:55.920 --> 05:56.974
Well, that's our Anna-Kat.

05:56.999 --> 05:58.728
She also doesn't like
confined spaces or cars.

05:58.797 --> 06:00.241
But bright side...
She hates Harry Potter.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.564
Mm-hmm.

06:01.633 --> 06:02.832
What'd you think?

06:02.901 --> 06:06.670
I'm not sure. Do we belong
in a fancy town like this?

06:06.738 --> 06:10.140
Well, hello. I'm Pam.
I live across the street.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.174
Katie.

06:11.243 --> 06:12.509
I'm Greg.

06:12.577 --> 06:13.777
I'm gonna go deal with that.

06:13.845 --> 06:15.545
Are you thinking of moving in?

06:15.614 --> 06:17.414
- Maybe.
- Oh, well, you just have to.

06:17.482 --> 06:19.849
Well, I don't know much about the town.

06:19.918 --> 06:22.686
Oh, the people of Westport
are so warm and welcoming.

06:22.754 --> 06:25.622
You have to rent it.
I just can't let you go!

06:26.692 --> 06:27.924
<i>Could I do such a thing?</i>

06:27.993 --> 06:30.060
<i>Could I trick this lady into moving here</i>

06:30.128 --> 06:32.362
<i>so there'd be another
fat housewife in Westport?</i>

06:32.431 --> 06:33.763
Fudge?

06:33.832 --> 06:35.999
You are so sweet.

06:36.068 --> 06:38.101
<i>Apparently, I could.</i>

06:38.170 --> 06:40.036
I think I'm gonna love it here.

06:42.541 --> 06:45.208
<i>She tricked me. Damn you, Fat Pam.</i>

06:55.520 --> 06:57.387
What the hell?

06:57.456 --> 06:58.822
Oh, my God.

06:58.890 --> 07:01.558
They're selling our lawn.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.119
You have no right to sell
our house out from under us.

07:06.244 --> 07:07.333
Yes, I know it's not our house,

07:07.419 --> 07:09.512
and you have every right to do
it, so I was wrong about that.

07:09.677 --> 07:12.096
But surely have
some sense of moral obligation?

07:12.164 --> 07:14.632
Okay, so I was wrong about that, too.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.568
To be fair, you don't own
the house, your mother does,

07:17.637 --> 07:20.204
so I would like
to have her contact information.

07:20.272 --> 07:23.407
No, I am not going to do that to myself.

07:23.476 --> 07:26.543
Wow. Don just went premium cable
at the end there.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.145
Why don't we just buy the house?

07:28.214 --> 07:30.147
I'll give you several million
reasons why we can't do that.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.482
We can rent.

07:31.550 --> 07:34.084
There's a place on Bayberry Lane
for $17,000 a month.

07:34.153 --> 07:36.253
I'll give you 15,000 reasons
why we can't do that.

07:36.322 --> 07:38.455
What do we do?

07:38.524 --> 07:42.059
Move... to a normal town
with normal people

07:42.128 --> 07:44.361
with restaurants that have
normal coffee additives.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.697
- We can't leave Westport!
- We're all happy here.

07:46.766 --> 07:50.267
Not all of us. This is a sign
that we should move.

07:50.336 --> 07:52.536
And there is a literal sign
in our front yard

07:52.605 --> 07:54.104
telling us that we have to move.

07:54.173 --> 07:57.007
So it's a sign and a sign.

07:57.076 --> 07:59.710
I won't accept that. You know what?

07:59.779 --> 08:02.346
We don't need Don to tell us
where his mother is.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.847
We can look up Linda Smith online

08:03.916 --> 08:05.349
and convince her to change her mind.

08:05.418 --> 08:08.752
Linda Smith.

08:08.821 --> 08:13.657
I'll give you 14,753 reasons
why that won't work.

08:13.726 --> 08:14.825
Right.

08:17.496 --> 08:19.196
I know Taylor and Oliver would be mad

08:19.265 --> 08:20.798
if we moved to a town like this,

08:20.866 --> 08:22.433
but they were mad
the first time that we moved,

08:22.501 --> 08:23.734
and they got over it.

08:23.803 --> 08:24.868
Well, what about Anna-Kat?

08:24.937 --> 08:26.804
She's taken a bit of a step back lately.

08:26.872 --> 08:29.540
Dr. Ellie says it's all part of
the process, but I don't know.

08:29.608 --> 08:33.577
Maybe a fresh start someplace
new is exactly what she needs.

08:35.881 --> 08:38.215
- Do you have any soy milk?
- No.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.783
- Cashew milk?
- No.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.217
- Lactose-free?
- No.

08:41.287 --> 08:42.785
Rice milk?

08:44.924 --> 08:46.303
Any other questions?

08:46.328 --> 08:48.692
No. You've answered them all correctly.

08:48.761 --> 08:52.730
This table is sticky.

08:52.798 --> 08:54.531
I'm supposed to bus my own table?

08:54.600 --> 08:56.600
I am a U.S. citizen.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.248
Look at him... He doesn't care.

08:58.273 --> 09:00.370
None of these people care here.

09:00.439 --> 09:01.686
They're not worried what they're wearing

09:01.764 --> 09:03.340
or how many calories are in egg whites

09:03.409 --> 09:04.975
or if they brushed their teeth
this morning.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.077
Did you not brush your teeth
this morning?

09:09.148 --> 09:10.247
Not sure.

09:10.316 --> 09:13.684
A town like this is where I belong,

09:13.753 --> 09:16.120
- not Westport.
- Katie, you can't move.

09:16.188 --> 09:17.721
Think about us... Without you,

09:17.790 --> 09:19.389
we're just two wealthy minorities

09:19.458 --> 09:21.158
sitting on the same side of a table.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.031
Aren't you gonna miss this?

09:28.100 --> 09:30.234
I mean, Westport is beautiful.

09:30.302 --> 09:33.137
I know, but nothing in there fits me,

09:33.205 --> 09:35.639
a candle in there costs $300...

09:35.708 --> 09:37.875
...and there's a restaurant
that will serve you

09:37.943 --> 09:40.077
an entire three-course meal
inside a mason jar.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.211
Still, you can't move.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.881
Move? You can't move.

09:43.949 --> 09:45.115
If you move, that'll make me

09:45.184 --> 09:46.784
the second-fattest housewife
in Westport.

09:56.228 --> 09:57.461
What's this?

09:57.530 --> 09:58.495
Sit.

10:01.066 --> 10:02.633
This is an intervention.

10:02.701 --> 10:04.301
So, I want to review the rules...

10:04.370 --> 10:05.769
We can say anything
we want to say to Mom

10:05.838 --> 10:07.037
without repercussions?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.173
- Yes.
- Okay. I'll go first.

10:09.241 --> 10:12.976
Mom, your wanting to move
makes me feel...

10:13.045 --> 10:14.378
She just walked away.

10:14.446 --> 10:16.113
Huh. I did not account for that.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.849
You know, I promised the kids

10:18.918 --> 10:20.184
you'd listen to what they had to say.

10:20.252 --> 10:21.685
Yeah, I got that...

10:21.754 --> 10:23.086
...but no thank you.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.755
What's going on, honey?

10:24.824 --> 10:26.256
Oliver has his first girlfriend,

10:26.325 --> 10:28.258
Taylor is the captain
of the volleyball team,

10:28.327 --> 10:29.726
and Anna-Kat is finally making friends,

10:29.795 --> 10:30.994
I'm Chairman of the...

10:31.063 --> 10:32.729
I do not want to hear about
the Recycling Committee.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.531
It's not a hard position to acquire.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.134
Sounds like the First Lady of Recycling
needs an attitude adjustment.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.869
The kids don't want to move.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.637
You would have heard that if you
had stayed for the intervention.

10:40.646 --> 10:43.273
I am not going to be lectured
by my children.

10:43.342 --> 10:45.584
They destroyed my body and my career

10:45.662 --> 10:47.177
and almost all my furniture.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.513
But you're the one
who was always pushing

10:49.582 --> 10:52.049
for family breakfasts
and family outings and...

10:52.117 --> 10:54.950
I am done being judged by
all the supermodel mommies

10:55.028 --> 10:56.887
when I drop the kids off
without a full face of makeup.

10:56.956 --> 11:00.123
I am done with them telling me
that my car is dented

11:00.192 --> 11:02.392
and that I have to wear a bra
in the grocery store.

11:02.461 --> 11:04.194
I'm done with this place, Greg.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.864
And seeing that sign go up in our yard

11:06.932 --> 11:08.599
just made it all clear to me.

11:17.476 --> 11:20.244
You know, I let you be captain
of this ship most of the time,

11:20.312 --> 11:21.578
because you enjoy it,

11:21.647 --> 11:23.580
and you're better
at picking TV shows than I am.

11:23.649 --> 11:25.883
But just so that we're on the same page,

11:25.951 --> 11:29.219
everything you just listed...
They're all about you.

11:29.288 --> 11:32.556
Nothing about how the kids feel
about this place or how I feel,

11:32.625 --> 11:35.826
but I guess that's all
that matters... How you feel.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.655
Mom, your wanting to move
makes me feel...

11:50.876 --> 11:53.110
What is she doing?

11:56.382 --> 11:59.616
Mom, what is going on?

11:59.685 --> 12:03.287
I may not belong here,
but the rest of you do,

12:03.355 --> 12:05.255
and that's what counts.

12:05.324 --> 12:07.324
Let's do this.

12:13.106 --> 12:14.301
Yeah!

12:14.426 --> 12:16.028
Yeah!

12:18.137 --> 12:21.171
You realize the house
is still for sale, right?

12:23.742 --> 12:24.808
I ruined the moment.

12:28.167 --> 12:29.862
Here you go.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.802
Okay... shut the curtains
and lock the doors.

12:34.871 --> 12:36.337
They can't buy what they can't see.

12:41.711 --> 12:43.110
Hello? Anyone home?

12:43.179 --> 12:44.345
My key doesn't work.

12:44.414 --> 12:46.213
We changed the locks. Go away.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.866
This house is not for sale.

12:47.951 --> 12:50.484
It is. That sign
with my name on it says so.

12:50.553 --> 12:52.649
Just open up. This tray
of cookies is getting heavy.

12:54.757 --> 12:55.756
Hey!

12:55.825 --> 12:57.058
We're not going anywhere.

12:57.126 --> 12:59.894
Yeah! you, Todd!

12:59.963 --> 13:00.993
Too much?

13:01.018 --> 13:03.130
You know, people don't really
need to see the inside.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.200
Whoever buys this house
is just gonna tear it down.

13:06.269 --> 13:07.602
Then we're going down with it,

13:07.670 --> 13:10.471
like Benjamin Guggenheim in the Titanic.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.577
Good reference, baby.

13:11.601 --> 13:15.327
This is a very bad situation,
but a very good cookie.

13:15.478 --> 13:16.877
The real-estate agent is right.

13:16.946 --> 13:18.980
Whoever buys this house
is just gonna tear it down.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.984
I wonder if the landlord
thought of that.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.187
Don, what can we do
to make you reconsider?

13:26.255 --> 13:29.190
That's easy... Outbid the cash
offer that's already come in.

13:29.258 --> 13:30.858
Or you could take a look at this.

13:30.927 --> 13:32.693
Is it a pile of cash?

13:32.762 --> 13:34.695
You can't put a price tag on these.

13:34.764 --> 13:36.130
It's a box of your old stuff.

13:36.199 --> 13:38.032
We found it in the basement.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.808
I haven't seen
this baseball glove in 30 years.

13:47.877 --> 13:50.711
- Takes you back, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

13:50.780 --> 13:51.879
You probably have a lot of
memories in this house.

13:51.948 --> 13:53.147
Sure do.

13:53.216 --> 13:56.083
Just so you know,
when someone buys this place,

13:56.152 --> 13:57.718
they're gonna tear it down.

13:57.787 --> 13:59.687
Flatten it like it was never there.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.656
And all those childhood memories...

14:01.724 --> 14:05.815
- All those precious childhood memories.
- ...they'll go down with it.

14:05.878 --> 14:10.264
In a cloud of dust scattered
across the fruited plains.

14:16.005 --> 14:17.371
I'm sick of it...

14:17.440 --> 14:19.073
You bought your mistress an apartment.

14:19.142 --> 14:20.374
Why don't you move in with her?

14:20.443 --> 14:21.440
Get out of my life!

14:21.465 --> 14:23.792
You're drunk again! You're always drunk!

14:27.737 --> 14:30.017
Yeah, lots of memories...

14:30.086 --> 14:31.252
all bad.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.854
I hope they level this place.

14:33.923 --> 14:36.223
You look like you're gonna cry.
Use this.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.498
We are not going to give up.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.119
We're going to call every Linda Smith

14:46.182 --> 14:48.669
in the tri-state area
until we find your mom.

14:48.738 --> 14:50.838
She went back to her maiden name
when my dad died.

14:50.907 --> 14:52.408
You'll never find her.

14:52.510 --> 14:53.541
Aww...

14:53.609 --> 14:57.044
That's where my cat Helen
had her last diabetic seizure.

15:00.917 --> 15:03.451
He's already getting offers.
We're out of time.

15:03.519 --> 15:04.752
I'm afraid it's over.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.822
No, it's not. We just have to find
the woman who owns the house.

15:07.890 --> 15:10.324
Who's gonna get her up to speed? Not it.

15:10.393 --> 15:12.259
Group photos of
all the championship teams

15:12.328 --> 15:13.461
are on the trophy case

15:13.529 --> 15:15.362
with the players' names
written underneath.

15:15.431 --> 15:17.965
Mrs. Smith was on
the 1956 championship team.

15:18.034 --> 15:19.567
The photo would have her maiden name.

15:19.635 --> 15:21.669
You are a genius.

15:21.738 --> 15:23.270
Right?

15:23.339 --> 15:26.774
- Okay. Spell "genius."
- Um...

15:26.843 --> 15:28.509
Honey, walk away. Leave a winner.

15:28.578 --> 15:30.244
Problem... The school's locked

15:30.313 --> 15:33.114
and Don's gonna try to sell
this place as fast as he can.

15:33.190 --> 15:34.718
Monday's gonna be too late.

15:34.835 --> 15:36.406
Unless a member of the family

15:36.484 --> 15:39.553
were an elected committee
official entrusted with...

15:39.622 --> 15:40.929
a key to the school.

15:41.190 --> 15:45.693
Oh, my God, something good has
finally come from volunteering.

15:51.934 --> 15:53.667
The trophy case
is at the end of the hall.

15:55.338 --> 15:58.005
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
motion sensors to the alarm.

15:58.074 --> 16:00.144
- This isn't gonna work.
- How are we gonna get past them?

16:00.230 --> 16:01.949
- We're not.
- We should just go for it.

16:02.043 --> 16:04.308
We can't just go for it.
I'm Chairman of the Recycling Committee.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.614
If we get caught,
that could all go away.

16:06.682 --> 16:09.083
Are the motion sensors
those little red lights

16:09.152 --> 16:11.380
- that flash when people walk by?
- Yeah.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.746
I can get past those
without them blinking.

16:13.823 --> 16:16.957
- I do it every day.
- Ohh.

16:17.026 --> 16:19.660
So that's why you walk
down the hall like that.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.996
Uh-huh. It's bad luck
to make them blink.

16:22.064 --> 16:25.266
Follow me.

17:05.473 --> 17:07.407
I just realized
we didn't all have to do this.

17:07.476 --> 17:10.743
I don't care. We're having
a fun family outing.

17:10.813 --> 17:12.279
Now, let's find Don's mom.

17:12.348 --> 17:13.881
Okay.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.182
Hmm...

17:15.250 --> 17:18.670
I think that's her... Linda Tepper.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.186
Linda Tepper. Good.

17:20.256 --> 17:22.122
I'm gonna throw you all
for a loop here...

17:22.191 --> 17:25.069
Good job, Taylor. Good job, Anna-Kat.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.794
All right. Let's go.

17:29.165 --> 17:30.264
There's no way I'm doing that again.

17:32.922 --> 17:34.401
Babe, I'll be stripped of my position!

17:34.470 --> 17:36.136
You're the only idiot
who wants that job.

17:48.584 --> 17:50.214
- Ms. Tepper?
- Yes?

17:50.308 --> 17:53.706
Katie and Greg Otto...
We rent your house in Westport.

17:53.831 --> 17:56.223
Of course! Look at you.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.691
You stayed the same.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.627
- Mm.
- Every woman who moves to Westport

17:59.695 --> 18:00.895
starves herself to fit in.

18:00.963 --> 18:02.363
I was afraid you might, too.

18:02.431 --> 18:05.599
Nope. I'd like to say I tried,
but I didn't.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.167
We'd love to talk to you
about selling the house.

18:07.236 --> 18:08.769
Don told me you were moving.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.571
Well, that's true, but only
because he's kicking us out.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.673
That kid...

18:12.742 --> 18:16.176
50 years old, and he is still
giving me headaches.

18:16.245 --> 18:17.311
It never ends.

18:17.380 --> 18:18.979
Please don't tell me that.

18:21.083 --> 18:24.184
I thought you couldn't take it anymore
and wanted to move on, just like I did.

18:24.253 --> 18:26.823
I have my days, believe me.

18:26.901 --> 18:28.923
I get it. I grew up there.

18:28.991 --> 18:30.958
Then all these stuck-up people moved in,

18:31.027 --> 18:32.293
the town started changing.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.761
The last straw for me

18:33.829 --> 18:36.830
was when Garrity's Liquor store
was turned into a juice bar.

18:36.899 --> 18:38.699
- Bastards.
- Juice.

18:38.768 --> 18:40.760
What is it with Westport and the juice?

18:40.903 --> 18:42.494
- She really doesn't like juice.
- Mnh-mnh.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.478
So I quit... I quit Westport.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.773
And when I met you,

18:45.841 --> 18:47.908
I thought you are
just what that place needs,

18:47.977 --> 18:51.350
that you would give them all
a much-needed kick in the ass.

18:51.444 --> 18:52.446
She didn't let you down.

18:52.507 --> 18:54.882
She kicks so much ass, she
doesn't have time to take names.

18:55.975 --> 18:57.718
He still makes jokes like that.

18:57.787 --> 19:00.854
You and your family can live
there as long as you like

19:00.923 --> 19:04.358
for the same rent, as long as
you keep giving them hell.

19:04.427 --> 19:06.060
Deal.

19:06.128 --> 19:10.097
And if we could put that whole
"Rent forever" thing in writing,

19:10.166 --> 19:11.966
I'd feel a lot more comfortable.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.838
So, we are staying put for good.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.040
Oh-hoo-hoo! I am so happy.

19:20.109 --> 19:22.643
Doris and I practiced
having breakfast without you.

19:22.712 --> 19:24.345
- It was bad.
- So bad.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.879
I had to sit across from her

19:25.948 --> 19:27.381
and watch her miss her mouth
with her straw

19:27.450 --> 19:29.450
over and over and over.

19:29.518 --> 19:32.853
All this is a lot of negative
energy for one person to absorb.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.888
We need you.

19:34.957 --> 19:36.357
Just give it to me straight...

19:36.425 --> 19:38.559
What is the least-weird
milk product you've got?

19:38.627 --> 19:40.928
- Here's some cream.
- But I thought...

19:40.997 --> 19:43.230
We started carrying it again...
just for you.

19:43.299 --> 19:44.898
Really?

19:44.967 --> 19:48.369
You guys did that just for me?
Do you even know my name?

19:50.306 --> 19:53.240
Angry lady, extra bacon?

19:53.309 --> 19:54.341
Close enough.

19:58.456 --> 20:01.806
_

20:02.440 --> 20:05.922
<i>The truth is, I had no idea
what I was getting into</i>

20:06.008 --> 20:07.676
<i>when we moved to this town.</i>

20:07.745 --> 20:10.694
<i>But now, well, now I know.</i>

20:10.873 --> 20:14.107
<i>Westport is the land
of hot moms and coddled kids,</i>

20:14.200 --> 20:16.375
<i>golden doodles and avocado toast,</i>

20:16.490 --> 20:18.744
<i>alkaline water and coffee colonics.</i>

20:18.867 --> 20:20.882
<i>It's everything I can't stand.</i>

20:21.140 --> 20:23.429
<i>But for better or worse...</i>

20:23.741 --> 20:26.570
<i>it's our home.</i>
