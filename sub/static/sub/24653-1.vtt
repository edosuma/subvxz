01:18.840 --> 01:22.840
When I died, I saw the whole world.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.160
You remember don’t you?

10:47.080 --> 10:53.160
Look at me. I’m alive.
I’m alive.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.560
Close.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.480
Have you our heirlooms Rāwiri?

42:17.480 --> 42:18.760
Yes

42:21.040 --> 42:23.280
We show compassion.

42:57.040 --> 43:00.320
Soar, my darling

43:00.320 --> 43:04.160
like The Great Albatross who led us here.

43:04.160 --> 43:08.640
Crossing the seas from Hawaiki

43:08.640 --> 43:12.680
To this and where our spirits now depart.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.880
Guide us

43:14.880 --> 43:17.280
like the Albatross

43:17.280 --> 43:21.120
who guided our ancestral canoe,

43:21.120 --> 43:27.000
to this land where we were to prosper.

43:31.360 --> 43:35.680
Gaze upon your land,

43:35.680 --> 43:40.960
the land that your ancestors gazed upon.

43:42.960 --> 43:48.760
Move swiftly to the summit of your sacred mountain,

43:48.760 --> 43:52.280
called Ahurei.

43:53.480 --> 43:57.160
There wait our ancestors for you,

43:57.160 --> 44:00.160
with the love of thousands

44:00.160 --> 44:03.680
for you my grandchild.

44:06.240 --> 44:12.880
There they wait to hold your hand.

44:25.920 --> 44:28.520
Return to us in spirit.

44:28.520 --> 44:34.920
Feel the love of your people of Ngāti Imurangi.

44:48.480 --> 44:55.280
That is who he is, noble woman.

45:03.280 --> 45:04.480
- Gift him.
- I won’t.

45:07.520 --> 45:08.720
Rāwiri

45:12.440 --> 45:16.520
A bone for a bone.

45:19.240 --> 45:22.960
Where is your grandchild Ranui?
The father?

45:22.960 --> 45:26.840
Where is he?
In prison isn’t he?

45:26.840 --> 45:30.240
- Hypocrite.
- Settle, cuz.

45:30.760 --> 45:36.520
You are right, Hinga.
My grandson is no angel.

45:38.040 --> 45:41.880
Where is the mother of our boy here?

45:41.880 --> 45:46.080
Your grandchild?
Where is she?

45:46.080 --> 45:49.120
A bone for a bone.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.800
How dare you.

45:51.800 --> 45:54.440
Where do you think you are, Ranui?

45:54.440 --> 45:58.360
In ancient times.
The time of our ancestors.

45:58.360 --> 46:00.000
Get out.

46:00.480 --> 46:05.200
- The time of our spiritual beliefs.
- Don’t.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.400
His world is different now.

46:09.400 --> 46:13.800
- Stop, dear woman.
- I cannot.

46:13.800 --> 46:16.600
Perhaps we are both to blame.

46:16.600 --> 46:21.440
We both did not teach our descendants
the way of our people.

46:21.440 --> 46:24.520
It was the white man who stripped it from us.

46:24.560 --> 46:28.800
Yes.
But we foolishly followed.

46:28.800 --> 46:32.320
And now this is the bitter taste we must swallow.

46:32.320 --> 46:34.880
Gift me my great-grandchild.

46:34.880 --> 46:39.360
You speak as if he is not my great

46:39.360 --> 46:40.520
That is true.

46:40.560 --> 46:45.640
But our ancestors believed
that our children were to be treasured.

46:45.640 --> 46:51.360
It is not our way
to trample on their sanctity,

46:51.360 --> 46:55.960
diminish them,
or frighten them.

46:55.960 --> 46:59.920
They are the face of our Gods.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.320
Now gift him.

47:03.280 --> 47:07.400
This I know.
But I will not.

47:08.320 --> 47:10.320
- Gift him.
- I can’t.

47:10.320 --> 47:12.960
- Give him!
- Let it be.

47:13.840 --> 47:18.120
One house has died,
another still lives.

47:18.720 --> 47:21.960
The house of Ngāti Tupuna.

47:21.960 --> 47:27.240
Unlike a canoe rope, a human bond
cannot be severed. No.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.760
It has been severed.

47:29.760 --> 47:32.160
I don’t care what you say!

47:33.360 --> 47:37.120
It was here that his light was extinguished.

47:37.120 --> 47:40.640
Gift him so he can rest peacefully.

47:41.680 --> 47:44.400
My great grandchild will rest peacefully here.

47:44.400 --> 47:48.960
But he’ll rest more peacefully in his paternal land.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.360
That be said.
I ask you to be merciful.

47:54.640 --> 47:56.320
I ask you to show mercy.

47:56.320 --> 48:00.560
I do not die like the Octopus,
I die fighting like the Hammerhead Shark.

48:00.560 --> 48:07.400
Let it go, so his spirit can rest unburdened,
dear grandmother.

48:07.400 --> 48:13.560
It’s already been decided in the heavens
the place where he will rest.

48:13.560 --> 48:17.320
You have honoured him bravely,
Hammerhead Shark.

48:17.960 --> 48:20.960
Now gift him.
It is done.

48:22.040 --> 48:25.640
Your great-grandmother is right, my boy.

48:25.640 --> 48:30.400
Forgive me, my little one.
Forgive me.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.720
Be gentle.

49:09.200 --> 49:11.160
A bone
for a bone.

49:14.040 --> 49:16.680
A treasure
for a treasure.

49:20.960 --> 49:23.880
You leave behind your people of

49:23.880 --> 49:29.000
Ngāti Imurangi who will always mourn for you

49:29.000 --> 49:32.280
and never forget you,

49:32.280 --> 49:36.640
or our grief my little one.

49:53.720 --> 49:59.560
Farewell, our chiefly grandchild.

49:59.560 --> 50:04.520
Go to your ancestors who wait for you to return.

50:06.560 --> 50:11.600
Leap off where spirits fly into the horizon.

50:11.600 --> 50:17.880
Farewell, our child.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.480
You all sit there pretending to be unaware.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:04.280
How dare you cry and lament
at the death of our babies.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:14.280
How dare you! You know who is
responsible and you keep your mouths shut.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.440
You know… You know… and what did you do?

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.640
Why didn’t you stop it?
Why?

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.320
How many of us have to
cower in pain?

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:40.560
How many have to die......
before you say...

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:45.560
enough! ENOUGH!

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.720
When I died I saw the whole world.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:29.320
Everything was big.
Everything was small.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:39.560
I see the people in the houses.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.320
I see the people
bringing in their washing.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.800
When I died, I was flying.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:37.240
I see these two sisters,
Aunty Titty and Aunty Bash.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.120
Did you know I can see inside?

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:57.320
The people are angry.
Their anger is a lightening bolt.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.360
It lights up the sky.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.520
I see the birds.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.000
I see the people in the streets.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.680
I see the people in the cars.

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.000
I see the people in the houses.

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.720
I see the people.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:03.400
I see the people.
I see the people

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:20.160
I see the clouds get darker.
I see the rain coming.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.200
Here comes the storm.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.760
I’m still here.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.280
I’m still here.
