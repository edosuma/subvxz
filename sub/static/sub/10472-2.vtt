'Though we were only
in our early 20s,

00:36.845 --> 00:37.887
'a little more than girls,

00:37.888 --> 00:41.869
'we served the women of the East End
in their hour of greatest need.'

00:42.869 --> 00:44.860
'In return for our care,

00:44.861 --> 00:48.852
'they gave us the most precious
gift they could...

00:48.853 --> 00:50.860
'their trust.

'This made us brave and tireless.

00:53.801 --> 00:56.880
'And in the main,
we did not doubt ourselves

00:56.881 --> 00:58.869
'because we were not doubted.'

01:00.809 --> 01:02.892
'But we were not invincible.

01:02.893 --> 01:06.873
'There were times when we faced
challenges and choices of our own.'

01:48.865 --> 01:51.824
Gosh. Are we really doing this?

01:51.825 --> 01:54.803
Dancing in our dressing gowns?
It appears so.

01:54.804 --> 01:55.829
Don't josh, Peter.

01:56.845 --> 01:58.873
What if I've got things
so awfully wrong?

01:58.874 --> 02:01.844
Does it feel as if you have?

02:01.845 --> 02:05.803
It feels like one of those very rare
occasions where the world

02:05.804 --> 02:08.794
is quite enormous
and I very small within it.

02:08.795 --> 02:09.833
I'm at your side.

02:10.836 --> 02:13.821
You can change your mind, Camilla.
You know that, don't you?

02:34.857 --> 02:36.893
Burdett Street, please,
Nurse Miller.

02:36.894 --> 02:39.832
The Kelly baby appears
to be on its way.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.893
Contractions started
three hours ago.

02:41.894 --> 02:43.865
Oh. And good morning.

03:03.829 --> 03:04.841
Oh!

03:11.845 --> 03:14.857
Sorry it's so early, Nurse.
Hope you got some sleep.

03:17.873 --> 03:21.812
Oh, here. Let me.
I'm fine, Mrs Cooke.

03:21.813 --> 03:24.827
And the babies of Poplar seem
entirely unconcerned with my sleep.

03:24.828 --> 03:27.853
Ah. Just as they should be.
Oh, bless ya. Kettle's on.

03:33.801 --> 03:37.865
Gentle pushes now, Renie. Let's
take this last part very slowly.

03:37.866 --> 03:39.812
Can you give me one more?

03:39.813 --> 03:41.868
I can't. I can't do no more.

03:41.869 --> 03:46.844
Yes, you can. Ain't you got
somewhere to be, Ma? I can't.

03:46.845 --> 03:48.853
You have to, Renie.

03:49.857 --> 03:51.805
I know it hurts.

03:53.813 --> 03:54.845
Just pant now.

03:57.797 --> 03:58.868
Just pant.

03:58.869 --> 04:01.849
Think of all them baby clothes
in your bottom drawer.

04:01.850 --> 04:05.848
Little mite can't wear 'em
till he's out, can he?

04:05.849 --> 04:07.864
That's it. Good girl.

04:07.865 --> 04:09.864
Can't give up now can we?

04:09.865 --> 04:12.797
Not when baby's head is crowning.

04:15.821 --> 04:18.825
That's it. That's the stuff.

04:19.873 --> 04:22.824
One more now, Renie...

04:22.825 --> 04:23.906
and your baby will be born.

04:25.881 --> 04:27.797
Just little pushes.

04:36.829 --> 04:39.804
You have a son, Irene.

04:39.805 --> 04:40.853
A little boy, Renie.

04:48.873 --> 04:51.813
Something warm
and clean please, Sheila.

05:03.805 --> 05:05.805
Wrapped my Renie up in this, we did.

05:06.821 --> 05:07.877
Same as my mum did for me.

05:32.861 --> 05:33.893
Thank you.

05:35.801 --> 05:36.885
You did all the hard work, Renie.

05:36.886 --> 05:38.821
Hello!

05:52.873 --> 05:55.873
Nurse Noakes, do you understand
the very great step

05:55.874 --> 05:57.880
you're about to take?

05:57.881 --> 05:59.809
Absolutely.

06:01.825 --> 06:03.832
And I'm utterly terrified.

06:03.833 --> 06:07.829
I generally find the Lord only asks
of us what he knows we can give.

06:09.821 --> 06:10.833
What if he's wrong?

06:12.813 --> 06:14.865
Then we should all be very afraid.

06:16.869 --> 06:19.821
Now, go and give
your news to the others.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.844
And this is your daddy.

06:45.845 --> 06:47.885
He's been waiting for you
a long, long time.

06:50.833 --> 06:53.836
A son, Pat. You got a little boy.

06:53.837 --> 06:57.819
Now that's when your troubles start.
Sound of wailing and ungodly smells.

06:57.820 --> 06:58.980
And that'll just be you, Pat.

07:00.857 --> 07:03.836
I know I have some silver
here somewhere.

07:03.837 --> 07:07.813
It has to be silver, doesn't it now,
for the luck? There you go, Son.

07:08.885 --> 07:10.833
I'll pay you back, Da...

07:11.861 --> 07:14.813
as soon as this mends
and I can earn again.

07:16.869 --> 07:18.857
May you never want for anything.

07:20.849 --> 07:23.849
Thank you, Nurse, for bringing him
safe into the world.

07:23.850 --> 07:26.828
He was very keen to come,
Mr Kelly.

07:26.829 --> 07:28.847
You've got a real
little soldier there.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.799
Quick. A toast.
Before he gets too sentimental.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.833
Nothing wrong with a bit of emotion,
Mr Kelly.

07:35.861 --> 07:39.808
Your good health. A son.
I have a son.

07:39.809 --> 07:40.860
To your son.

07:40.861 --> 07:41.869
Congratulations.

07:43.877 --> 07:45.817
To your son.

07:50.877 --> 07:53.855
If you could see to Mrs Danvers,
that frees me up

07:53.856 --> 07:56.837
for the Bow Road tenement.
Yes, of course. Thank you.

07:56.838 --> 08:01.856
Ah. Safety and the art of cycling.
The Cubs.

08:01.857 --> 08:05.823
Fred, might we discuss this later?
Nurse Noakes, just the person.

08:05.824 --> 08:07.851
We need a dressing change
on Mr Campbell.

08:07.852 --> 08:11.841
Sister Evangelina, if you would...
I'm afraid I can't visit
Mr Campbell.

08:11.842 --> 08:14.808
Or indeed any of my patients.

08:14.809 --> 08:17.843
What are you talking about,
you can't visit your patients?!

08:17.844 --> 08:19.881
One doesn't know where to start.

08:21.797 --> 08:25.804
Well, I'll be on a train
bound for Manchester...

08:25.805 --> 08:27.881
where I'm to begin
my work as a missionary.

08:28.885 --> 08:31.840
A missionary?
Training in Manchester.

08:31.841 --> 08:34.799
Final destination...

08:34.801 --> 08:37.844
Sierra Leone, Africa. Africa?!

08:37.845 --> 08:40.865
It's all been terribly quick.
Rather peculiar really.

08:40.866 --> 08:43.799
I posted the letter barely
a month ago.

08:43.801 --> 08:44.855
Peter and I are in
a frightful tizz.

08:44.856 --> 08:47.801
We possess virtually nothing
in linen. We'll melt.

08:52.801 --> 08:53.869
I thought you were happy here.

08:53.870 --> 08:55.836
Why didn't you tell us?

08:55.837 --> 08:58.889
Swan in, swan out.
That's what you young girls do now.

09:00.845 --> 09:03.885
It has honestly been the hardest
decision I've ever made.

09:03.886 --> 09:06.888
But it's something
I feel I have to do.

09:06.889 --> 09:08.864
I believe God wants me there.

09:08.865 --> 09:12.827
And I have to do it now, before
the pitter-patter of tiny feet.

09:12.828 --> 09:15.837
Or if they take after me,
the patter of larger feet.

09:18.817 --> 09:21.881
The only reason I'm even half brave
enough to go is because of you.

09:21.882 --> 09:25.800
You've shown me
I have something to offer the world.

09:25.801 --> 09:29.796
And in six months, I'll be back,
breaking pipettes,

09:29.797 --> 09:31.885
crashing around. You'll be praying
to God to post me back to Africa.

09:31.886 --> 09:35.856
But six months is an absolute age.
Anything could happen.

09:35.857 --> 09:38.849
I might need glasses.
Jenny could find a boyfriend.

09:38.850 --> 09:40.848
Well, almost anything.

09:40.849 --> 09:46.808
Africa indeed! God's got plenty
of work for you here in Poplar.

09:46.809 --> 09:48.841
Starting with Mr Campbell's
septic leg.

09:54.837 --> 09:56.805
It's only because she'll miss you.

09:57.877 --> 09:59.868
We all will.

09:59.869 --> 10:01.825
Thank you.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.845
Well, I'll take the Cubs on for ya.

10:06.846 --> 10:08.832
Just until you get back.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.855
How will I manage without you all?

10:10.856 --> 10:13.861
I've never been happier
in all my life than here.

10:13.862 --> 10:17.856
Lawks, before I met you,
I couldn't even ride a bicycle.

10:17.857 --> 10:21.828
Well, you won't get far
in Africa without one. Quite.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.852
You owe it all to us.

10:23.853 --> 10:27.869
I hope you've mentioned that
to him upstairs. Absolutely.

10:33.857 --> 10:36.880
Ah. Would you settle
my taxi man's account?

10:36.881 --> 10:40.836
From Richmond? Again?
Would you wait here, please?

10:40.837 --> 10:42.871
I'll see that
you're reimbursed. Sister!

10:42.872 --> 10:46.799
We're all thrilled that
you're seeing more of your nephew,

10:46.800 --> 10:50.795
but is it necessary to take quite
so many taxi cabs on account?

10:50.796 --> 10:52.857
As you know, our funds
are not in abundance.

10:52.858 --> 10:55.840
You are aware of the omnibus strike?

10:55.841 --> 10:59.821
I would surely incur the wroth of
heaven to consider public transport

10:59.822 --> 11:00.888
at such a time.

11:00.889 --> 11:04.804
Besides, no matter how they dress,

11:04.805 --> 11:07.849
there are wolves in
almost every lane these days.

11:07.850 --> 11:11.840
Then we must pray for
a resolution with the unions.

11:11.841 --> 11:13.849
Or a miracle.

11:20.877 --> 11:22.856
Hello, stranger.

11:22.857 --> 11:24.876
Oh, my gosh. Jenny!

11:24.877 --> 11:26.873
What are you doing here?

11:27.893 --> 11:30.820
Well, if you're not
in a frightful rush,

11:30.821 --> 11:32.853
I'll tell you over a cup
of the finest tea.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.860
It's 22 stories

11:36.861 --> 11:38.824
over in Newham.

11:38.825 --> 11:40.820
It's quite remarkable.

11:40.821 --> 11:43.887
Better housing, modern facilities
for modern people.

11:43.888 --> 11:47.831
And we're using a new technique.
LPS. Large Panel System building.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.889
It means we can cast large,
prefabricated...

11:52.797 --> 11:53.805
Sorry.

11:54.869 --> 11:57.871
I haven't seen you for six months
and here I am banging on
about concrete.

11:57.872 --> 11:59.891
No, it's my favourite subject.

11:59.892 --> 12:02.849
There must be so much more.
Please continue.

12:06.873 --> 12:10.872
Honestly, Jimmy, it's wonderful
to see you so animated.

12:10.873 --> 12:12.837
Even if it is about concrete.

12:14.825 --> 12:17.803
So, does that mean you'll be
based around here now?

12:17.804 --> 12:18.855
For a while, anyway?

12:18.856 --> 12:22.861
The firm is. I'm in and out really.
Plenty of site visits.

12:25.849 --> 12:27.889
Perhaps we'll bump
into each other again.

12:29.797 --> 12:30.837
I'd like that.

12:32.825 --> 12:34.837
It really is lovely
to see you, Jimmy.

12:41.877 --> 12:43.892
Oh, Nurse.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.855
Do you want a cup of tea?
I'd love one, Mrs Cooke,

12:46.856 --> 12:49.857
but it's a flying check-up. I know
I'm a bit partial,

12:49.858 --> 12:53.825
but he's proper perfect, he is.

12:57.877 --> 13:01.797
Good afternoon, Mrs Kelly.
Midwife here.

13:02.889 --> 13:05.889
Rest now. Your mum's
bringing you some tea.

13:08.837 --> 13:12.845
Lord, but he was worth the pain,
Nurse. He ain't cried once.

13:13.881 --> 13:17.829
I need to have a hold of him, Nurse.
I got a real craving, I have.

13:18.837 --> 13:20.868
What is it, Nurse?

13:20.869 --> 13:22.856
Nurse?!

13:22.857 --> 13:24.832
What's the matter?

13:24.833 --> 13:28.815
He's not breathing. What?
What you saying? What you saying?

13:28.816 --> 13:30.893
What's the matter? Telephone
for Doctor Turner. It's the baby.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.812
Oh, my Lord. Mum! Mum!

13:33.813 --> 13:36.883
Quickly now, Mrs Cooke. And no-one
else is to come in here. No-one.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.851
For God's sake, do something.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.837
Mrs Kelly, please, back to bed.
Please, God...

13:41.838 --> 13:44.813
Please, God, my baby... No.

14:01.822 --> 14:02.837
Excuse me.

14:03.861 --> 14:04.885
Out the way!

14:24.869 --> 14:26.809
He's gone.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.796
Can you help him?

15:33.797 --> 15:36.857
We'll do whatever we can.
Doctor Turner will take charge now.

15:36.858 --> 15:39.860
Has Mr Kelly been informed? Yeah.

15:39.861 --> 15:41.813
It's just up there, Doctor.

16:01.893 --> 16:03.857
Mrs Kelly, I'm so very sorry.

16:05.845 --> 16:08.841
It don't make no sense, Doctor.
He was right as rain.

16:09.873 --> 16:11.864
How can he be gone?

16:11.865 --> 16:14.884
I can't answer that, Mrs Cooke.
Not yet.

16:14.885 --> 16:17.844
Nurse, you brought him
into this world...

16:17.845 --> 16:20.813
He couldn't have had more life
in him, could he?

16:21.865 --> 16:24.885
Because your little boy
passed away so suddenly,

16:24.886 --> 16:26.837
there has to be an inquiry.

16:27.873 --> 16:30.813
I'm afraid that means a postmortem.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.857
Everything will be done
with the greatest care.

16:36.869 --> 16:37.893
I want to hold him.

16:39.857 --> 16:43.837
Mrs Kelly... He's gone.
Please. I need to hold him.

16:44.845 --> 16:45.849
Renie?

16:47.849 --> 16:49.877
What name did you choose
for your son?

16:51.841 --> 16:52.849
Thomas.

16:55.805 --> 16:57.801
We wanted Thomas.

17:00.817 --> 17:02.841
May I say a blessing for Thomas?

17:18.805 --> 17:21.813
I am the resurrection
and the life, sayeth the Lord.

17:23.857 --> 17:28.841
He that believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

17:30.801 --> 17:34.829
And who so ever liveth,
and believeth in me shall never die.

17:37.845 --> 17:39.848
Amen.

17:39.849 --> 17:40.873
Amen.

19:17.853 --> 19:19.888
I couldn't save him.

19:19.889 --> 19:22.800
I tried...

19:22.801 --> 19:24.804
I tried so hard.

19:24.805 --> 19:25.881
Of course you did.

19:25.882 --> 19:27.832
It was all too late.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.845
You did what you could,
what any of us would have done.

19:32.841 --> 19:36.880
I'm late. I've missed three
house calls. I need to get on.

19:36.881 --> 19:39.841
Don't be ridiculous.
We'll cover your calls.

19:39.842 --> 19:43.808
Hot Chocolate. Aspirin. Bed.

19:43.809 --> 19:44.893
No arguments.

20:00.877 --> 20:04.804
These are all
of Nurse Miller's notes.

20:04.805 --> 20:07.815
And, please, you're most welcome
to join us for dinner.

20:07.816 --> 20:11.839
Thank you. But I want to try
and get a bit ahead of the inquiry.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.893
Is there anything else
I can get you, Doctor Turner?

20:14.894 --> 20:17.824
Some of your faith, perhaps?

20:17.825 --> 20:19.877
It's at times like this
I wish I had one.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.817
It's at times like this
I wish it made a difference.

20:27.829 --> 20:29.845
Sorry, I should leave you
to your work.

20:29.846 --> 20:32.796
No. Please. Stay.

20:32.797 --> 20:33.865
Take tea with me.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.845
I'm expected in the dining room.

21:11.877 --> 21:14.812
No Cub Scouts in Africa.

21:14.813 --> 21:16.816
No. No, probably not.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.811
She's off to Manchester.
Missionary training.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.861
I know. I took her to the station.

21:21.862 --> 21:23.824
Well, that's that then.

21:23.825 --> 21:24.869
Good night, Vienna.

21:25.873 --> 21:27.817
Good morning, Africa.

21:29.821 --> 21:30.893
We may not get there.

21:30.894 --> 21:32.797
To Africa.

21:33.801 --> 21:35.827
I can transfer
to the Sierra Leone Police

21:35.828 --> 21:37.859
because I've all my experience
as a constable here.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.835
Well, what then? Lost your passport?

21:39.836 --> 21:42.851
I've just found out I have to pass
a physical examination.

21:42.852 --> 21:44.883
I've never been a stranger
to a treacle sponge.

21:44.884 --> 21:47.855
Married life's only made me
more accustomed.

21:47.856 --> 21:50.813
I get out of puff when I do
the stairs. I might not pass.

21:51.825 --> 21:52.860
Good.

21:52.861 --> 21:54.816
You'll both stay here then.

21:54.817 --> 21:56.859
Camilla thinks I'm in already.
We both did.

21:56.860 --> 21:59.857
All our plans are set.
It'll break her heart.

22:03.881 --> 22:06.799
Well, none of us
want to see a thing like that.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.853
You've gotta help me, Fred.
I can't fail that physical.

22:10.881 --> 22:13.812
Mind your backs.
Copper coming through.

22:13.813 --> 22:15.864
Come on. Come on.

22:15.865 --> 22:17.808
Weave!

22:17.809 --> 22:18.848
Weave!

22:18.849 --> 22:20.845
It works wonders
for your wobbly bits.

22:28.878 --> 22:31.848
Officer Noakes coming through.
Make way.

22:42.837 --> 22:44.881
Come on, Mr Noakes. Imagine
there's a bunch of offenders

22:44.882 --> 22:49.813
and you're tucking them all off to
jail. That's it. Pick your knees up.

23:05.805 --> 23:09.865
Constable Noakes.
As we'd arranged, we're here
to speak to Nurse Miller.

23:09.866 --> 23:13.841
Yes, of course. I wish
the circumstances were different.

23:17.889 --> 23:19.876
Please, go through.

23:19.877 --> 23:22.831
You say there was nothing about
the birth that troubled you

23:22.832 --> 23:25.841
or you felt was out of the norm?
No. Not at all.

23:31.841 --> 23:35.801
And you're certain you would
have noticed an abnormality?

23:36.845 --> 23:38.799
We can see from the log book,

23:38.800 --> 23:41.859
you returned very late the night
before you delivered the Kelly baby.

23:41.860 --> 23:44.827
That's correct.
We had an emergency delivery.

23:44.828 --> 23:47.873
And yet within a few hours, you were
out again to see Mrs Kelly.

23:49.805 --> 23:51.844
I'm not sure I understand.

23:51.845 --> 23:53.812
It's just we all get tired.

23:53.813 --> 23:56.797
I know when I put a long shift
in I can be a bit...

23:56.798 --> 23:59.848
cloudy the next morning. Peter...

23:59.849 --> 24:03.805
Constable Noakes, we're used to
working very long hours here

24:03.806 --> 24:04.825
as you know.

24:14.877 --> 24:18.815
Again, you will excuse the nature
of some of these questions,

24:18.816 --> 24:20.056
but do you often drink on duty?

24:23.853 --> 24:25.879
Mr Kelly mentioned you took
a drink of, um...

24:25.880 --> 24:29.893
I believe it was whisky. To wet
the baby's head, that was all.

24:29.894 --> 24:32.836
Baby Thomas was delivered by then.

24:32.837 --> 24:35.833
Constable Noakes, am I
being accused of something?

24:37.865 --> 24:40.841
I did everything I could.

24:44.829 --> 24:47.813
You understand we have to ask
these questions?

24:50.861 --> 24:53.883
It feels if as everything
has changed, doesn't it?

24:53.884 --> 24:55.851
This awful business with Cynthia

24:55.852 --> 24:59.809
and Chummy off in Manchester
learning her missionary positions.

24:59.810 --> 25:00.856
Trixie!

25:00.857 --> 25:03.889
I hope you're planning on
staying dependable you.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.813
Oh, my goodness. Jenny Lee?

25:09.849 --> 25:10.864
What?

25:10.865 --> 25:13.839
Something's going on that
you haven't breathed a word of.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.871
There's nothing.

25:14.872 --> 25:18.825
You are an appalling chum
and an even worse liar. Now spill.

25:20.885 --> 25:23.824
I bumped into Jimmy, that's all.

25:23.825 --> 25:25.796
No. Don't get excited.

25:25.797 --> 25:28.833
How is the poor boy...
still broken-hearted?

25:30.805 --> 25:32.820
Well, that's just it,

25:32.821 --> 25:35.804
he isn't a boy any more, he's...

25:35.805 --> 25:37.853
he's rather grown into himself.

25:37.854 --> 25:39.873
Has he indeed?

25:45.833 --> 25:47.809
What happened?

25:48.893 --> 25:50.889
They think it's my fault.

26:26.821 --> 26:29.836
Nurse Miller.

26:29.837 --> 26:31.825
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

26:45.841 --> 26:46.891
I've reserved our usual table.

26:46.892 --> 26:49.877
I hope it's got a sea view.
I'm very particular, these days.

26:49.878 --> 26:50.893
These days!

26:58.805 --> 27:02.799
I'm sure a bow tie like this gets
you plenty of attention.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.893
A gentleman never
speaks of such things.

27:04.894 --> 27:07.808
Oh, go on.

27:07.809 --> 27:09.800
Well, it's nothing really.

27:09.801 --> 27:11.821
I don't believe for a minute
you made the tea

27:11.822 --> 27:13.832
and sandwiches yourself.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.887
Well, since you ask,
there is a girl...

27:15.888 --> 27:18.833
It's not serious,
just a girl from the City office.

27:18.834 --> 27:22.804
No, I think it's lovely,
you should be having fun.

27:22.805 --> 27:24.841
Always so generous, aren't you?

27:24.842 --> 27:26.801
Thinking of me.

27:29.797 --> 27:32.837
You're my friend,
why wouldn't I want you to be happy?

27:34.841 --> 27:37.880
So, what about you?
Still breaking hearts?

27:37.881 --> 27:39.816
Sorry, I didn't mean...

27:39.817 --> 27:41.887
Oh, no, I'm too
busy for all of that...

27:41.888 --> 27:43.881
we're in the middle of a baby boom.

27:47.797 --> 27:49.836
Don't work too hard, Jenny.

27:49.837 --> 27:52.817
You know what they say - "The jobs
won't love us back."

27:55.893 --> 27:59.868
Sister Monica Joan?
I'm afraid this has to stop.

27:59.869 --> 28:02.869
The taxis to and fro, we simply
cannot afford them.

28:07.805 --> 28:11.819
Thank you, my good man. As you
heard, I no longer have need of you.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.815
Sister, I didn't mean
as of this minute.

28:13.816 --> 28:15.853
I simply meant for you to
review your needs.

28:17.893 --> 28:20.852
Like the temple of Thebes...

28:20.853 --> 28:22.844
I crumble,

28:22.845 --> 28:25.825
my needs reviewed with
every passing year.

28:26.881 --> 28:29.868
The time of being useful,

28:29.869 --> 28:33.801
the time of being important...

28:36.821 --> 28:38.825
these, too, have passed.

28:42.813 --> 28:44.835
How was breakfast on the Seine?

28:44.836 --> 28:46.879
A Thermos of tea and a cheese
sandwich... I don't think

28:46.880 --> 28:48.847
Maurice Chevalier need worry.

28:48.848 --> 28:50.891
A cheese sandwich? Oh, the romance.

28:50.892 --> 28:54.795
How much longer, Nurse? Oh,
and I need the bottle back...

28:54.796 --> 28:56.803
milkman'll do his nut
if I lose another.

28:56.804 --> 28:58.857
We'll be with you as soon as we can,
Mrs Payne.

28:58.858 --> 29:00.821
Mrs Jeffries?

29:02.817 --> 29:03.844
Mrs Payne?

29:03.845 --> 29:07.812
I'm ready for you now,
if you'd like to come through.

29:07.813 --> 29:11.892
Actually, dear, I need the lav.
You carry on.

29:11.893 --> 29:13.859
It's quite all right, I can wait.

29:13.860 --> 29:15.865
Oh, no, no, no, no, you go on, love.

29:15.866 --> 29:17.872
I'll see the next one.

29:17.873 --> 29:20.801
I ain't risking it, not with her.

29:22.829 --> 29:26.836
Yeah, either way, better
to be safe than sorry.

29:26.837 --> 29:29.816
You know who I mean. Her, that one.

29:29.817 --> 29:34.860
49, 50. Progress, old lad,
progress indeed.

29:34.861 --> 29:37.817
Towards an early grave.

29:38.889 --> 29:42.812
I thought we had the rats back.

29:42.813 --> 29:44.892
What are you up to?

29:44.893 --> 29:46.877
You pair of ninnies.

29:49.873 --> 29:51.817
The Missionary Mission.

29:52.869 --> 29:54.868
Are you in, or are you out?

29:54.869 --> 29:57.880
Because if you're out,
you know too much...

29:57.881 --> 30:00.837
and that leaves us
all in a sticky situation.

30:07.869 --> 30:11.811
For a woman of the cloth you ain't
half got a ruthless streak.

30:11.812 --> 30:15.831
Good with a secret, though. If Nurse
Noakes' dream depends on him

30:15.832 --> 30:18.805
he's going to need all the help
he can get.

30:18.806 --> 30:21.800
Gardening is the best
exercise there is.

30:21.801 --> 30:22.883
Keep him motivated.

30:22.884 --> 30:25.893
And when you've done that,
we've a path needs weeding.

30:34.797 --> 30:36.831
I'm afraid clinic's
finished for today.

30:36.832 --> 30:38.859
I would have come sooner,
only, erm, Mr Woodrow,

30:38.860 --> 30:42.803
a gentleman I work for, had an
urgent report and I do his typing so

30:42.804 --> 30:45.839
I couldn't just leave and tomorrow
we've got a board meeting...

30:45.840 --> 30:48.795
I do the minutes and, well, that
takes care of tomorrow

30:48.796 --> 30:50.885
and Friday's always our busiest day,
what with people wanting to

30:50.886 --> 30:55.820
get it all out the way before their
weekends, lucky them I say...

30:55.821 --> 30:58.809
Francine Spencer. How do you do?

31:02.873 --> 31:04.857
I'll finish up here. You go on.

31:07.801 --> 31:09.825
This way, Mrs Spencer.

31:18.801 --> 31:21.837
I thought you might enjoy some
tea... I made a pot.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.836
Well,
it's not quite the temptation of Eve

31:24.837 --> 31:27.844
but presumably one should be
grateful.

31:27.845 --> 31:29.877
I've been doing a little
bit of accountancy work.

31:32.821 --> 31:34.853
Are we to move to bread and water?

31:34.854 --> 31:36.808
Rather the opposite.

31:36.809 --> 31:39.823
I've managed to find a little extra
and it works out to be just

31:39.824 --> 31:42.857
enough to get to Richmond
and back by taxi cab...

31:42.858 --> 31:45.845
just while this bus strike
continues.

31:49.829 --> 31:53.824
I shall have to consult my calendar

31:53.825 --> 31:55.816
and that of the stars...

31:55.817 --> 31:59.808
let us hope some joyous alignment
presents itself.

31:59.809 --> 32:03.857
Well, whenever the heavens or
the London taxi cabs collide,

32:03.858 --> 32:05.801
the funds are there.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.796
It seems unfair of us

32:08.797 --> 32:11.861
to deprive your family of you
for the sake of a few pounds.

32:11.862 --> 32:14.821
I am sure they need
you as much as we do.

32:22.837 --> 32:24.847
Are you allowed to continue working?

32:24.848 --> 32:27.843
Mr Woodrow don't know yet.
He just thinks I'm filling out...

32:27.844 --> 32:29.877
puts it down to the digestives.

32:31.809 --> 32:33.877
I'm afraid you're going to have
to tell him soon.

32:33.878 --> 32:38.844
Not even I could eat that many
digestives.

32:38.845 --> 32:42.880
Childhood diseases? Diphtheria?
Rheumatic disease?

32:42.881 --> 32:46.809
Had the lot. My mum says
I get everything except diamonds.

32:47.825 --> 32:51.797
Is there any history of diabetes
in your or your husband's family?

32:51.798 --> 32:53.877
Not that I know of, Nurse.

32:59.893 --> 33:02.873
It's the only sin that shows,
isn't it, Miss?

33:05.825 --> 33:08.845
Would it help if I made your
appointments for the end of
clinics?

33:08.846 --> 33:10.852
It's a bit quieter then.

33:10.853 --> 33:14.840
He will marry me. He just doesn't
know yet. About this.

33:14.841 --> 33:17.807
We're going to do it terribly
proper. The wedding.

33:17.808 --> 33:20.847
I'll have the dress...
I love what Grace Kelly wore...

33:20.848 --> 33:22.865
and we'll have the
house in the country.

33:22.866 --> 33:24.833
My chap'll see to that.

33:31.829 --> 33:34.840
Oh, could you take over with
Mrs Lennon?

33:34.841 --> 33:38.799
It's just with Nurse Noakes away
we're struggling, somewhat.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.875
I'm rather in the middle of things.

33:40.876 --> 33:43.869
I thought Sister Bernadette
was on the rota?

33:43.870 --> 33:45.841
It would help us enormously.

33:47.801 --> 33:48.833
Of course.

34:06.841 --> 34:08.873
You'd think after this many we'd
know what to do.

34:08.873 --> 34:10.817
Thank God you're here.

34:15.885 --> 34:18.833
She's upstairs,
I'll be out here if you need me.

34:44.813 --> 34:45.873
Good afternoon, April.

34:49.797 --> 34:52.804
I'm just going to examine you
and see how far along you are.

34:57.877 --> 35:02.801
Where would we be without you
Nonnatuns?

35:25.853 --> 35:27.825
Over three quarters dilated.

35:29.829 --> 35:32.820
Not long now, April.

35:32.821 --> 35:35.885
The contractions may be very
close together now.

35:35.886 --> 35:40.832
They said it was one of you young
ones with that poor Kelly baby.

35:40.833 --> 35:43.828
Can't be a shock like it.

35:43.829 --> 35:45.796
I'm so sorry, April...

35:45.797 --> 35:46.873
I just need to step
out for a moment.

35:46.874 --> 35:48.848
Where you going?

35:48.849 --> 35:50.837
There's really no need to worry.

35:56.873 --> 35:59.796
She's almost fully dilated...

35:59.797 --> 36:02.855
membranes have just ruptured,
contractions are rapid...

36:02.856 --> 36:03.893
she will deliver soon.

36:03.894 --> 36:05.828
Now listen to me...

36:05.829 --> 36:07.804
you have to go back in there.

36:07.805 --> 36:09.833
You have to look after Mrs Lennon.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.836
All I can see is his little
blue face.

36:12.837 --> 36:13.893
Oh, Cynthia, listen to me...

36:13.894 --> 36:16.864
I'm on my way
but you cannot leave her.

36:16.865 --> 36:18.860
Don't you understand?

36:18.861 --> 36:21.832
I can't do
that to someone else's baby.

36:21.833 --> 36:22.893
'Just wait with her.'

36:22.894 --> 36:24.892
I can't.

36:24.893 --> 36:29.800
I can't go back and I can't stay
in a place where everyone thinks

36:29.801 --> 36:31.837
that little boy is dead
because of me.

36:31.838 --> 36:32.857
'Cynthia!'

36:36.837 --> 36:38.856
She's left Mrs Lennon.

36:38.857 --> 36:41.795
It was too soon.
I shouldn't have sent her out.

36:41.796 --> 36:44.799
You must go to Mrs Lennon, reassure
her and keep the poor woman calm.

36:44.800 --> 36:45.865
This must not affect her delivery.

36:45.866 --> 36:47.796
What about Cynthia?

36:47.797 --> 36:49.853
Our priority is with our patient.
Now hurry.

36:58.821 --> 36:59.873
Slow down!

37:28.833 --> 37:30.844
Careful!

37:30.845 --> 37:31.861
Who was that?

38:00.877 --> 38:02.844
How is Mrs Lennon?

38:02.845 --> 38:04.819
Thrilled by her new baby, Dora.

38:04.820 --> 38:07.803
But utterly confused by her
flurry of midwives...

38:07.804 --> 38:09.835
I imagine that's
the collective noun.

38:09.836 --> 38:13.831
One or a hundred, no mother would
care as long as we do our job.

38:13.832 --> 38:14.873
Now, where is Cynthia?

38:14.874 --> 38:17.812
I quite mean to wring her neck.

38:17.813 --> 38:18.889
She's with you, surely?

38:18.890 --> 38:20.816
What?

38:20.817 --> 38:22.857
We thought she'd waited for you.

38:22.858 --> 38:24.840
She hasn't come back.

38:24.841 --> 38:27.002
Mr Lennon saw her cycle off,
I assumed she'd come home.

38:31.821 --> 38:34.795
Well, if you could
ask your officers in Stepney

38:34.796 --> 38:37.859
and Bow to keep an eye out for her,
as well? Thank you.

38:37.860 --> 38:40.881
Go to the clinic and I think try the
church, as well,

38:40.882 --> 38:43.805
she may be searching for some peace.

39:12.797 --> 39:14.856
Excuse me. Yes, love?

39:14.857 --> 39:16.837
Have you seen...?

39:18.857 --> 39:19.881
That way.

39:46.817 --> 39:48.805
Is this seat taken?

39:52.829 --> 39:54.809
Come on, let's go home.

39:56.849 --> 39:57.873
How can I ever go back?

39:59.805 --> 40:02.811
I've made such a terrible
mess of things. Mrs Lennon...

40:02.812 --> 40:05.877
Mrs Lennon is perfectly well
and has a healthy baby girl.

40:05.878 --> 40:07.825
Oh, thank God.

40:17.813 --> 40:19.808
What happened?

40:19.809 --> 40:20.892
I panicked.

40:20.893 --> 40:25.860
I got swept along and I couldn't
turn back so I had to keep going...

40:25.861 --> 40:30.825
the traffic, it was terrifying.
I couldn't stop...

40:33.801 --> 40:35.832
I mean before...

40:35.833 --> 40:36.885
with Mrs Lennon?

40:40.861 --> 40:44.893
I thought it would happen again,
I thought I'd lose the baby.

40:44.894 --> 40:46.849
You lost your nerve?

40:49.877 --> 40:51.887
Anything could have
happened to Mrs Lennon

40:51.888 --> 40:55.831
because you're blaming yourself
for something that isn't your fault.

40:55.832 --> 40:58.891
We don't know it's not my fault,
not till the post-mortem.

40:58.892 --> 41:01.865
So until then you're going to
presume yourself guilty?

41:04.881 --> 41:08.821
Do you really think Sister Julienne
would send you out to patients

41:08.822 --> 41:10.797
if she even had half a doubt?

41:13.841 --> 41:15.856
Cynthia...

41:15.857 --> 41:18.844
we believe in you.

41:18.845 --> 41:20.805
Why can't you trust us?

41:22.809 --> 41:25.865
What do I do, how do I come back?

41:28.813 --> 41:32.833
You put your best foot forward
and you get on with things.

41:34.817 --> 41:36.877
And know that we're all
willing you on.

41:39.825 --> 41:41.837
Because we need you, Cynthia Miller.

41:42.881 --> 41:44.829
As a nurse and as a friend.

41:56.865 --> 41:59.809
It's going to be all right, you know.

42:01.825 --> 42:04.833
But you'll have to butter up
Fred to fix your bike.

42:11.833 --> 42:14.852
And Trixie will take quite
some soothing...

42:14.853 --> 42:16.857
I'd suggest a bottle of Babycham,

42:16.858 --> 42:19.857
a ticket to next week's dance?

42:34.813 --> 42:36.851
Camilla?
You're not back until tomorrow.

42:36.852 --> 42:37.857
I would disagree.

42:40.837 --> 42:43.805
What a bonus.

42:48.797 --> 42:52.828
Peter? I found this
letter beneath the biscuit tin.

42:52.829 --> 42:54.839
It says you have to pass
a comprehensive physical

42:54.840 --> 42:58.835
examination before they accept
you into the Colonial Police.

42:58.836 --> 43:00.831
The letter was
dated before I went away.

43:00.832 --> 43:01.867
Why on earth didn't you tell me?

43:01.868 --> 43:02.891
What did you expect to me say?

43:02.892 --> 43:04.847
"Put everything on the back burner

43:04.848 --> 43:07.815
"because I might be too much
of a roly poly to pass the exam"?

43:07.816 --> 43:08.859
You're not a roly poly.

43:08.860 --> 43:11.799
I'm doing every ruddy thing
I can to make sure I pass,

43:11.800 --> 43:13.887
and all the time dreading I'm
the one who'll let you down.

43:13.888 --> 43:17.833
So, no, I didn't feel that was news
I wanted to share with you.

43:23.833 --> 43:27.864
I've been terribly selfish.

43:27.865 --> 43:31.808
Africa is about what I want.

43:31.809 --> 43:34.812
And here you are, my dear Peter,

43:34.813 --> 43:36.833
with your fears running
away with you.

43:37.861 --> 43:42.844
Perhaps what I took to be a calling
was a dreadful case of mishearing.

43:42.845 --> 43:45.893
What kind of missionary would such
thoughtlessness make me?

43:52.877 --> 43:55.864
I think you're wonderful.

43:55.865 --> 43:57.837
And I'd walk to Africa
if I had to,

43:57.838 --> 43:59.852
just to be at your side.

43:59.853 --> 44:01.877
If it's meant to be, it will be.

44:05.817 --> 44:06.861
Yes.

44:12.865 --> 44:16.868
The envelope contains
the results of the post-mortem.

44:16.869 --> 44:19.825
Mr and Mrs Kelly have already
been informed.

44:22.877 --> 44:27.832
Before you open it, do you think you
did or didn't do something

44:27.833 --> 44:29.865
which caused
the death of Thomas Kelly?

44:32.821 --> 44:35.885
Your profession is about judgment,
about a decision

44:35.886 --> 44:40.840
made in an instant which may save
a mother and a child, or lose both.

44:40.841 --> 44:44.865
Your instinct matters greatly.

44:46.809 --> 44:50.833
I did everything I could
and should have done.

44:51.861 --> 44:54.867
Then whether you're ready
to hear it or not,

44:54.868 --> 44:57.801
I believe you're a wonderful
midwife, Nurse Miller.

45:17.877 --> 45:20.844
There's no blame, Nurse Miller.

45:20.845 --> 45:22.825
Not you, not the Kellys.

45:23.833 --> 45:25.801
Not even fate.

45:26.837 --> 45:28.888
It was atelectasis...

45:28.889 --> 45:31.868
the baby's lung never fully
expanded.

45:31.869 --> 45:34.877
There's nothing you or anyone
could have done.

45:49.853 --> 45:53.824
Nurse has come, love.

45:53.825 --> 45:55.873
I'll put the kettle on.

45:58.861 --> 46:00.892
You didn't need to, Nurse...

46:00.893 --> 46:03.805
Sister Evangelina's been coming by.

46:04.865 --> 46:08.880
Let me, please. You just rest.

46:08.881 --> 46:11.881
You're very kind.

46:16.817 --> 46:18.813
It's like he never happened.

46:19.885 --> 46:23.837
They say what the eye don't see
the heart don't grieve for.

46:23.838 --> 46:24.873
Big fat lie.

46:27.841 --> 46:30.853
But I have this, still...

46:33.865 --> 46:35.860
smells of him.

46:35.861 --> 46:38.805
My boy.

46:50.801 --> 46:51.865
Got space for 'em, now.

47:25.869 --> 47:27.796
Hello, Nurse?

47:27.797 --> 47:29.808
Oh, hello... you off to work?

47:29.809 --> 47:31.827
I could be off to
the moon, for all I know.

47:31.828 --> 47:33.877
Feel like I'm floating.
It's official.

47:35.869 --> 47:37.892
Oh, that's wonderful.

47:37.893 --> 47:41.812
Congratulations, I'm so pleased.

47:41.813 --> 47:44.835
James this is my nurse, Miss Lee.
Nurse Lee...

47:44.836 --> 47:45.849
this is my James.

47:47.873 --> 47:49.824
How do you do?

47:49.825 --> 47:51.808
Well, we best be going.

47:51.809 --> 47:53.849
Come along, James, I don't
want to be late.

47:53.850 --> 47:54.888
James?

47:54.889 --> 47:56.817
Coming, dear.

48:14.877 --> 48:17.816
There's no money for a funeral.

48:17.817 --> 48:19.885
They're having to bury baby
Thomas in the coffin of a local

48:19.886 --> 48:22.828
woman who passed away last night.

48:22.829 --> 48:24.816
I can't bear it for them.

48:24.817 --> 48:26.840
There is a charitable fund.

48:26.841 --> 48:29.873
We can find the details for them and
help them with their application.

48:29.874 --> 48:34.828
Sister, Mr Kelly is far too proud.
He'd see it as begging.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.844
Then it shall come from us.

48:36.845 --> 48:38.812
We are their community,

48:38.813 --> 48:39.883
there can be no question of pride.

48:39.884 --> 48:42.861
I'm afraid we do not have
the resources to spare.

48:43.869 --> 48:47.832
Then we shall use my taxi fund
toward the funeral.

48:47.833 --> 48:49.801
I insist upon it.

48:52.893 --> 48:56.801
But what about your family?
They'll miss your visits.

48:57.893 --> 49:00.816
I shall make
arrangements for my nephew

49:00.817 --> 49:03.808
and his children to visit me here.

49:03.809 --> 49:07.865
We can take lunches in the garden,
providing the weather is fine.

49:07.866 --> 49:13.800
I believe the children are fond
of the Bunty and lemonade...

49:13.801 --> 49:15.809
please see both are in good supply.

49:30.805 --> 49:33.800
No good, old lad?

49:33.801 --> 49:37.824
I passed. I bloody passed.

49:37.825 --> 49:39.816
Next stop, Africa.

49:39.817 --> 49:40.861
Oi. That's my bike. Oi!

49:40.862 --> 49:43.836
Come on Fred, keep up.

49:43.837 --> 49:44.869
Oi!

50:15.853 --> 50:16.889
Do you love her?

50:18.829 --> 50:20.809
Does it make a difference?

50:21.885 --> 50:23.805
It does to Francine.

50:26.877 --> 50:28.880
It was just a bit of fun.

50:28.881 --> 50:30.817
Jimmy.

50:31.885 --> 50:34.817
I'm going to do the right thing.

50:35.833 --> 50:37.796
For who?

50:37.797 --> 50:40.881
Because Francine has plans for a
wedding and a house in the country.

50:43.801 --> 50:46.852
Francine has a lot of plans.

50:46.853 --> 50:48.892
I think I'm one of them.

50:48.893 --> 50:51.823
For God's sake,
Jimmy, you're going to have a baby.

50:51.824 --> 50:54.893
It will change your life,
and if you're not sure
you have got to be honest.

50:56.881 --> 50:58.888
I was...

50:58.889 --> 51:01.821
six months ago,
when I told you I loved you.

51:14.817 --> 51:15.938
I'll always be here for you.

51:23.881 --> 51:25.889
I don't want another friend, Jenny.

51:29.877 --> 51:32.801
I wish I could have been
enough for you.

53:01.841 --> 53:04.844
Keep him warm...

53:04.845 --> 53:08.832
keep him safe...

53:08.833 --> 53:10.841
till the day that I can.

53:35.801 --> 53:37.824
Sister Julienne?

53:37.825 --> 53:40.829
Did I mention that the
children are fans of cream cakes?

53:40.830 --> 53:44.804
No, I don't believe you did,
but let me see to that.

53:44.805 --> 53:45.892
You are a dear.

53:45.893 --> 53:48.876
Yes, aren't I?

54:10.805 --> 54:12.857
Do you think perhaps people
have forgotten?

54:12.858 --> 54:13.885
Quite possibly.

54:26.849 --> 54:28.821
I suppose with the week we've had.

54:28.822 --> 54:30.797
Indeed.

54:36.857 --> 54:37.893
What on earth is that?

55:17.865 --> 55:19.816
They're singing our song.

56:07.877 --> 56:09.885
Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.

56:11.821 --> 56:15.824
There is a greater gift
than the trust of others.

56:15.825 --> 56:18.801
That is to trust in oneself.

56:20.821 --> 56:23.819
It's from us all... I hear the roads
ain't too clever out there,

56:23.820 --> 56:25.889
so, you get into any bother,
you ring that as loud as you can...

56:25.890 --> 56:28.816
I swear we'll all hear it.

56:28.817 --> 56:29.857
Back before you know it.

56:30.857 --> 56:34.816
No words of mine
could match those inside.

56:34.817 --> 56:35.853
Thank you.

56:37.893 --> 56:41.872
I forbid it.
You can't possibly leave.

56:41.873 --> 56:43.860
What a load of old tosh.

56:43.861 --> 56:47.805
Course she's got to go.
You've had the calling, haven't you?

56:48.845 --> 56:49.873
You look after her. I will.

56:49.874 --> 56:51.808
Safe journey. Thank you.

56:51.809 --> 56:52.821
Best of luck, Chummy.

56:52.822 --> 56:57.828
Some might call it
confidence, others name it faith.

56:57.829 --> 57:02.844
But if it makes us brave,
the label doesn't matter...

57:02.845 --> 57:05.816
for it's the thing that frees us,

57:05.817 --> 57:07.825
to embrace life itself.

57:19.893 --> 57:25.832
Chummy would be back with us
before the year was out.

57:25.833 --> 57:28.880
She'd chased her dream with
courage...

57:28.881 --> 57:31.805
and, oh, how we loved her.

57:39.809 --> 57:41.837
Bye!

57:42.857 --> 57:44.816
Safe journey!

57:44.817 --> 57:45.885
Miss you.

57:48.865 --> 57:50.873
We'll be back.

57:58.825 --> 58:00.836
Can I help you?

58:00.837 --> 58:02.873
I think we might be
getting someone new.

58:02.874 --> 58:04.820
You're going to need them.

58:04.821 --> 58:06.857
I've just been seconded to
The London...

58:06.858 --> 58:07.884
Jimmy?

58:07.885 --> 58:09.881
I think you'll find
in the present day, Mrs...

58:09.882 --> 58:11.824
Carter.

58:11.825 --> 58:13.796
Both of them.

58:13.797 --> 58:15.841
Jimmy?
You're going to be all right, Jimmy.

58:16.853 --> 58:18.893
I promise you.
