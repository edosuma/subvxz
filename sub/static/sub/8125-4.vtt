¶ mister, we could use a man ¶

00:45.778 --> 00:51.683

00:59.725 --> 01:04.995
ah, seven.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

01:05.063 --> 01:06.998
St. Charles place.

01:07.066 --> 01:09.634
Wanna buy it ?
How much is it ?

01:09.702 --> 01:11.870
It's $140, Edith.
Can't you read there ?

01:12.938 --> 01:15.140
Well, I-I don't know.

01:15.207 --> 01:17.976
Uh, uh, what do
you think, Gloria ?

01:19.078 --> 01:21.012
Well, you already own
states Avenue.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.081
This'll give you
two-thirds of a monopoly.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.316
Aw, come on, Edith.
Will ya make up
your own mind.

01:25.384 --> 01:27.318
Make your own decisions,
ya know.

01:27.386 --> 01:30.021
In the real world, you don't go
to your competition for advice.

01:30.089 --> 01:34.492
- She's not in the real world.
It's only a game.
- So is life a game, buddy boy.

01:36.062 --> 01:38.496
Whether you play
the game in here
or out there,

01:38.564 --> 01:40.865
you gotta play it
to win, right ?

01:40.933 --> 01:43.401
Where did we
hear that, Archie ?

01:43.468 --> 01:46.571
Was it on <i>mannix</i>
<i>or</i> <i>the bold ones</i> ?

01:49.041 --> 01:51.743
Keep your mind
on your property,
huh, Edith ?

01:51.811 --> 01:56.147
"Whether it's
this game in here
or that game out there--"

01:56.215 --> 01:58.516
you wanna buy
St. Charles's place ?

02:01.320 --> 02:03.654
I'll take it.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.924
Whoopee. The dingbat
makes a decision.

02:09.895 --> 02:12.663
Twenty, thirty,
forty, fifty--

02:12.732 --> 02:15.600
what are you countin'
the tens for ? You got
a pile of hundreds.

02:15.667 --> 02:17.869
Here's a hundred.
Gimme four tens.
There's $140.

02:17.937 --> 02:20.071
Put it in the bank.
Let's go, huh ?

02:20.139 --> 02:22.073
Come on, daddy.
Stop nagging at her.

02:22.141 --> 02:24.209
And you haven't answered
Michael's question yet.

02:24.276 --> 02:27.578
- Are you going with him to the
blood bank tomorrow morning ?
- The blood bank ? No.

02:27.646 --> 02:29.580
Reading railroad.
I'll buy it.

02:29.648 --> 02:33.684
- Why not, arch ? You said
last week you'd go with me.
- I changed my mind.

02:33.753 --> 02:37.789
I ain't givin' none of my blood
unless I know who's gonna be
on the receivin' end of it.

02:37.857 --> 02:39.958
Hey, well,
what's the difference ?

02:40.025 --> 02:44.062
The difference is,
some radical blows up
a building, right ?

02:44.130 --> 02:46.697
He gets shot;
He needs a transfusion.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.734
Well, he ain't gonna get
none of Archie bunker's blood !

02:52.071 --> 02:54.939
Neither is anybody else,
I got a feelin'.

02:55.007 --> 02:58.509
I think you're right, Michael.
That's just an excuse, daddy.

02:58.577 --> 03:01.679
Tennessee Avenue.
My property.
The rent is $14.

03:01.747 --> 03:03.681
Let's have it.
All right.
I'll give it to you.

03:03.749 --> 03:05.784
Relax there.
Don't act so pushy.

03:05.851 --> 03:09.553
I don't know why he won't
give blood. He never gives
anything to anybody.

03:09.621 --> 03:11.722
[ Sneezing ]

03:11.791 --> 03:13.992
He gave me
this cold I got.

03:16.595 --> 03:18.529
All right, here we go
for a roll now.

03:18.597 --> 03:23.601
He's always givin' me colds.
Over the years, he's given me
a lot of colds.

03:23.669 --> 03:25.670
Edith, I'm tryin'
to roll over here, huh ?

03:25.737 --> 03:29.674
It's all right for him
when he gets a cold.
He's the husband.

03:29.741 --> 03:32.510
He can take time off
and go to bed with it.

03:32.577 --> 03:34.512
Edith, I'm tryin'
to roll here.

03:34.579 --> 03:37.782
While I'm runnin' up
and down stairs,
waitin' on him--

03:44.223 --> 03:46.390
but when I get
a cold--

03:49.628 --> 03:54.165
I'm the wife.
I can't take time off.
I can't go to bed.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.801
Will you
stifle yourself.
[ Sniffles, sneezes ]

03:56.869 --> 03:58.803
Oh--

03:58.871 --> 04:01.005
why do you do that ?

04:01.073 --> 04:04.976
You know I'm very, very
susceptible of colds, Edith.

04:05.044 --> 04:08.880
Really, now.
I mean, ever since the war--
the big one.

04:08.948 --> 04:10.882
It happened because
I was sleepin' in...

04:10.950 --> 04:13.818
Them wet tents all the time,
with the rain pourin' in on me.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.687
All right, Archie. Not the
"big war" routine again, huh ?

04:16.755 --> 04:19.690
The big war made
a lot of people very sick.

04:23.329 --> 04:26.530
- I get a cold
every winter this time--
- all right, Archie. We know.

04:26.598 --> 04:30.134
You get the only war-connected
head colds in the country.

04:30.202 --> 04:32.971
- Now, will you
roll the dice, please ?
- All right, I'm rollin'.

04:33.038 --> 04:34.973
Here we go.
There we are.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.975
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

04:37.042 --> 04:39.010
Park place. Right next
to the boardwalk.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.746
That's the best monopoly
on the board. Come on.
Okay, 350. 350.

04:41.813 --> 04:43.814
Here you are.
Five hundred.
Change.
All right.

04:43.883 --> 04:46.384
Here's your deed.
All right.
Ha-ha-ha.

04:46.451 --> 04:49.187
Look at him gloating.
You'd think
he was really rich.

04:49.255 --> 04:51.189
Yeah, well,
I am rich.

04:51.257 --> 04:54.625
A man is rich who can
enjoy himself in the bosom
of his family, huh ?

04:59.531 --> 05:01.933
You sure are
shovelin' it tonight, arch.

05:07.139 --> 05:11.409
"A man is rich
who can enjoy himself--"

05:11.476 --> 05:13.778
you know who said that ?

05:13.845 --> 05:16.247
Marcus welby, m.D.

05:19.351 --> 05:23.254
- Will you roll, huh ?
- I wanna ask you
something, Archie.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.356
That, uh, guy that you
wouldn't give blood to.

05:25.424 --> 05:27.758
The radical who got shot
blowin' up a building ?

05:27.826 --> 05:30.094
<i>Yeah ?</i>
<i>How do you know</i>
<i>that the blood</i>
<i>he finally gets...</i>

05:30.162 --> 05:32.096
Won't be
William Buckley's ?

05:32.164 --> 05:34.399
Because--
oh !

05:34.466 --> 05:37.068
I gotta go to jail.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.070
Good.

05:40.339 --> 05:43.674
Make it
solitary confinement, huh ?

05:43.742 --> 05:47.278
Because bill Buckley
would never give
no blood of his...

05:47.346 --> 05:49.880
To some radical who was
blowin' up buildings.

05:49.949 --> 05:53.318
Archie, if Buckley's blood
is in a bank,
he's not gonna know.

05:53.385 --> 05:56.587
Well, he might not know,
but down at the blood bank,
they know.

05:56.655 --> 05:59.190
They got names
on all the jars.
No, they don't.

05:59.258 --> 06:01.225
Oh, he doesn't get
the concept, Michael.

06:01.293 --> 06:04.829
Look, daddy, blood is blood.
It's all the same,
no matter who it comes from.

06:04.896 --> 06:08.032
<i>[ Mocking ] "No matter</i>
<i>who it comes from."</i>
<i>You hear that ?</i>

06:08.100 --> 06:10.068
You send 'em out to get
a normal education,

06:10.135 --> 06:12.070
they come back with
all these subversions.

06:12.137 --> 06:14.538
Where do they
get it, huh, Edith ?

06:14.606 --> 06:16.941
Huh ?
I can't talk.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.043
I'm in solitary.

06:25.851 --> 06:27.785
Well, let me
tell you somethin',
little girl.

06:27.853 --> 06:31.055
Blood is like anything else
in life. You got your good
and you got your bad.

06:31.123 --> 06:34.292
You do not know
what you're talking about.
All right.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.428
For instance,
John dillinger
had bad blood.

06:38.797 --> 06:40.731
John dillinger ?
Who is John dillinger ?

06:40.799 --> 06:42.833
Aw, gee.
Listen to this guy.

06:42.901 --> 06:47.071
He's arguin' blood,
he don't even know
who John dillinger is.

06:47.139 --> 06:49.840
You're over your head,
Sonny boy.
Get outta the water.

06:49.908 --> 06:51.909
Look, Archie,
I-I don't wanna argue with you.

06:51.977 --> 06:54.712
I'm just stating a fact.
All blood is the same.

06:54.779 --> 06:57.982
Well, if all blood is the same,
let me ask you this:

06:58.050 --> 07:01.185
How come they ain't got
no swedes in the mafia ?

07:06.392 --> 07:09.560
What does that got to do
with anything ?

07:09.628 --> 07:14.932
Because your Italians got
a lock on it, that's why.
It's in their blood.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.403
The same way it's in
your blacks' blood to do
the Scooby-dooby-doo.

07:18.470 --> 07:20.938
Aw, jeez !
Oh, that's terrible !

07:21.006 --> 07:23.574
Daddy !
That's true !
It's not true !

07:23.642 --> 07:25.709
[ Stammering ]
What I'm telling you,
Archie,

07:25.777 --> 07:27.945
is an accepted
scientific fact.

07:28.013 --> 07:30.048
You take any two pints
of blood,
yeah, any two.

07:30.115 --> 07:32.050
Uh, one from Asia,
one from America--

07:32.117 --> 07:34.318
or one from a black man
and one from a white man.
Yeah.

07:34.386 --> 07:36.954
Any two pints of blood,
and assumin' that both donors
are healthy,

07:37.022 --> 07:39.957
and the types match,
those two pints of blood
are interchangeable.

07:40.025 --> 07:44.128
Yeah, because chemically
they're exactly the same.
Right, exactly.

07:44.196 --> 07:47.231
Are you both finished ?
[ Mike ]
Yeah.

07:47.299 --> 07:49.900
You want my reaction ?

07:49.968 --> 07:51.969

for the last time.

in any other man's body, period.

the same blood in me
as Katharine hepburn.

to hear me say that.

heard it before,
did we, Michael ?
No, no.

I'd like to hear the story.
Go ahead, ma.

08:55.867 --> 08:58.436
Well, I was a little girl,
about 11,

08:58.504 --> 09:01.872
and I was visiting
with these relatives
we had in Connecticut,

09:01.940 --> 09:03.941
in east Hartford.

09:04.009 --> 09:06.677
And it was summer,
and we kids,
the three cousins,

09:06.745 --> 09:08.846
we was chasin' an ice truck,

09:08.913 --> 09:12.816
because then
everybody had iceboxes
instead of refrigerators,

09:12.884 --> 09:15.553
and they delivered ice,
and in the summer,

09:15.621 --> 09:20.424
if you were a kid and you
could get a piece of ice
off of one of them trucks--

09:20.492 --> 09:22.493
well--
[ Clears throat ]

09:22.561 --> 09:26.030

stopped short,

09:26.097 --> 09:29.567

with my arm up like this.

<i>Get on</i>
<i>with it, Edith !</i>

09:31.870 --> 09:36.106
And this part of my arm--
you can't see it now
because of the dress--

09:38.343 --> 09:41.379
but I got it hooked
right on this iron part...

09:41.446 --> 09:44.882
That was stickin' out
of the back end of the truck.

09:44.949 --> 09:48.419
Oh, and I-I don't remember
this part too good
because I passed out,

09:48.487 --> 09:53.057
but I-I lost so much blood
before they got me
to the hospital,

09:53.124 --> 09:55.459
they had to give me
a transfusion.

09:56.528 --> 09:59.096
Which they did.

10:07.706 --> 10:10.174
Uh, is that it ?
Of course
that ain't it.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.776

a long ways to go.

will ya, Edith.
Oh, yeah.

10:16.381 --> 10:20.150

that I was in the hospital,

10:20.219 --> 10:23.754
Katharine hepburn
was in there too.

10:23.822 --> 10:26.691

a long story short,

- [ groaning ]
- My aunt heard...

That three days
after he donated blood to <i>me,</i>

the same man donated blood...

10:38.337 --> 10:40.904

Uh, something's wrong
with the story, ma.

- Well, that's what happened.
- Well, something's very wrong.

10:59.824 --> 11:03.361
Yeah, Edith, now wait a minute.
Let's get this thing straight.

11:03.428 --> 11:06.264
The whole point
of the story
always was...

11:06.331 --> 11:09.867
That they put some
of Katharine hepburn's blood
into you.

11:09.934 --> 11:12.403
Ain't that right ?

11:13.505 --> 11:16.274
Oh, no.

11:16.341 --> 11:18.276
The point was...

11:18.343 --> 11:21.211
That they put some of
the same blood in me...

11:21.280 --> 11:24.448
As they put
in Katharine hepburn.

11:31.690 --> 11:36.126
Well, the next time
I hope youse'll think twice
before youse encourage her !

roll the dice.

a little queasy ?

The chink over there.

12:14.933 --> 12:18.202
What's a chink
doin' here ?
You mean a Chinese man ?

12:18.269 --> 12:21.271
All right. Whatever.
I was just wonderin'
what he was doin' here.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.407
He's here the same
as everybody else,
to give blood.

12:23.475 --> 12:25.810
Oh, no, no, no.
He ain't gonna give
no blood here.

12:25.877 --> 12:28.446
What are you talkin' about ?
That's what everybody's
here for.

12:28.513 --> 12:31.716
Get outta here.
He's an oriental.
That's a yellow race.

12:31.783 --> 12:34.819
Oh. And, of course,
he has yellow blood.

12:37.021 --> 12:39.289
Look, there's an irishman
with green blood.

12:40.592 --> 12:43.594
Hey, look over there.
There's governor rockefeller.

12:43.662 --> 12:45.929
Where ?
There. The guy
with the blue blood.

12:50.101 --> 12:52.035
Knock off the funnies,
will ya.

12:53.104 --> 12:55.773
Look over there now.

12:55.841 --> 12:58.576
He ain't here
to give blood at all.
He's a doctor.

12:58.643 --> 13:01.311
That shows you how smart
you are, college boy.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.681
I'll bet down in Chinatown
they got a chinky red cross...

13:03.749 --> 13:06.183
Takin' blood
for their own people.
Oh, gee.

13:06.251 --> 13:09.953
What do you mean, "oh" ?
They must have the same
thing up in Harlem too.

13:10.021 --> 13:12.055
Mike. Mr. bunker.
How's it goin' ?

13:12.123 --> 13:15.025
Oh, hiya, Lionel.
How are ya ?
Lionel, how ya doin' ?

13:15.093 --> 13:18.028
Imagine meeting you
down here at the blood bank.

13:23.301 --> 13:27.004
What were you sayin', Archie,
about a blood bank up in Harlem
or something like that ?

13:27.071 --> 13:29.239
Dummy up, will ya.
Dummy up.

13:29.307 --> 13:32.242
You feelin' all right,
Mr. bunker ?
<i>Certainly.</i>

13:32.310 --> 13:36.179
Oh, he's all right, Lionel.
He just didn't expect to see
a black man here givin' blood.

13:36.247 --> 13:39.283
If you wanna make an argument
out of it, I bet he ain't here
to give blood.

13:39.350 --> 13:41.619
He's here to do
some odd job, right, Lionel ?

13:41.686 --> 13:43.754
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I sweeps up.

13:46.024 --> 13:47.991
I left my broom
back there.

13:48.059 --> 13:51.462
I need some water.
Get me some
water too, huh ?

13:54.032 --> 13:57.568
Poor Mike.
They get all confused,
don't they ?

13:57.636 --> 13:59.603
Your goody-goody
white liberals.

13:59.671 --> 14:03.073
You tell 'em all men
are brothers and we all
come from the same God,

14:03.141 --> 14:05.476
and right away they think
we all got the same blood.

14:05.544 --> 14:08.045
Ain't that ridiculous ?

14:16.054 --> 14:17.988
I know what you mean.

14:19.825 --> 14:23.060
Yeah. I mean, if they
start pumpin' our blood
into you white folks,

14:23.127 --> 14:26.964
well, who knows
what might happen--
you could all turn black.

14:33.371 --> 14:36.774
Well, I tell you, Lionel,
I-I-I think there's
some doubt about that.

14:42.113 --> 14:45.583
- You wouldn't wanna
chance it, would you ?
- No.

14:49.087 --> 14:51.856
But here's
the guy that knows
all about everything.

14:51.923 --> 14:54.758
Huh ? Mr. big liberal
ignoramus himself.

14:54.826 --> 14:59.497
Why don't you talk
to Lionel here about some
of your fancy scientific facts.

14:59.564 --> 15:02.432
Lionel, you been
puttin' him on again ?
I think I need some water too.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.837
This kid's
got common sense.

15:06.905 --> 15:09.740
He <i>knows</i> his blood
ain't the same as yours,
even if you don't.

15:09.808 --> 15:13.677
Archie...
What can I tell you ?

15:13.745 --> 15:16.480
Uh, let me take this
by the numbers, all right ?

15:16.548 --> 15:18.949
Let's see if we can really
talk this thing through.

15:19.017 --> 15:22.620
- Now, first,
we'll take your heart.
- Why my heart ?

15:22.687 --> 15:26.757
Well, my heart, your heart.
It's the heart that pumps
the blood, right ?

15:26.825 --> 15:29.693
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Now, does your heart ask you</i>
<i>who gave you the blood ?</i>

15:29.761 --> 15:31.795
No. It's just like
the water pump in a car.

15:31.863 --> 15:34.632
The-- the water pump in a car ?

15:36.401 --> 15:40.137
You get all choked up
about some dingbat story
about chasin' an ice truck,

15:40.204 --> 15:44.575
and you sit here and tell me
that the human heart's like
a water pump in a car ?

15:44.643 --> 15:46.644
The human heart
is the most important,

15:46.711 --> 15:49.813
the most emotional organ
in your body.

15:49.881 --> 15:53.651
It's where all your--
your love and your romance
is kept there.

15:54.686 --> 15:57.120
<i>Everybody knows that.</i>

15:57.188 --> 15:59.122
We ain't machines yet,
Sonny boy.

15:59.190 --> 16:02.459
Yeah, but that's the point
I'm trying to make.
The heart is a machine.

16:02.527 --> 16:05.663
That's why they can
give you a new one nowadays
when the old one packs up.

16:05.730 --> 16:08.899
- It's just like a car.
- It ain't like a car !

16:11.636 --> 16:13.637
Keep your voice down.

16:15.373 --> 16:18.375
Archie, I'm just talkin'
about transplants.
Wait a minute.

16:18.443 --> 16:20.711
Now, if you're gonna start
talkin' about transplants,

16:20.779 --> 16:22.713
you're gonna make
my point for me.

16:22.781 --> 16:24.815
Now, the first time out
with them transplants,

16:24.883 --> 16:26.817
they put a woman's heart
in a man's body, right ?

16:26.885 --> 16:29.787
Yeah. So what ?
So it's tough enough
for a woman and a man...

16:29.854 --> 16:32.890
To live together
in the same house,
never mind the same body.

16:34.492 --> 16:37.494
That heart
was rejected, right ?
All right, case closed.

16:37.562 --> 16:39.496
Next case.
Archie,
wait a second--

16:39.564 --> 16:43.100
let me talk.
Take that dentist
down there in South Africa.

16:43.167 --> 16:46.036
The Jewish guy.
Every organ in his body
was Jewish.

16:46.104 --> 16:49.139
You check me up on that
if you don't believe me.

16:49.207 --> 16:51.642
Orthodox too,
for all I know.

16:51.710 --> 16:55.479
So what did they do ?
They put a Christian heart
in the guy.

16:55.546 --> 16:58.215
Now, you know all them
orthodox Jewish organs...

16:58.282 --> 17:00.951
Have to reject
that Christian heart.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.088
Or "versa versa."

17:05.423 --> 17:07.357
Oh, Lionel, come here.
Sit down.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.425
You know what we was
talkin' about here ?
Transplants.

17:09.493 --> 17:12.262
Oh, bad business.
Unless, of course,
it's white on white.

17:12.329 --> 17:14.464
Oh, Lionel,
cut it out !

17:14.531 --> 17:16.398
Let him talk !

17:16.467 --> 17:20.671
You see this guy here ?
He don't wanna hear nothin' from
nobody unless it's his opinion.

17:20.739 --> 17:23.941
I remember one of
the first heart transplants
they did in South Africa.

17:24.009 --> 17:26.609
The Jewish dentist.
I was tellin' him.
No, this is another one.

17:26.678 --> 17:29.513
Remember ? They put
the black man's heart
in the white body.

17:29.580 --> 17:31.749
Now, you know
those poor blacks
in South Africa...

17:31.816 --> 17:34.584
Don't have
their civil rights
the way we do up here.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.755
[ Mike ]
Oh-- oh--

17:37.822 --> 17:40.691
you see, things are still
very segregated <i>there.</i>

17:40.759 --> 17:43.894
So, can you imagine,
that poor white body...

17:43.962 --> 17:46.196
Walkin' around
with that black heart ?

17:46.264 --> 17:49.599
I mean, the poor man
wouldn't even know
what restroom to use.

17:59.844 --> 18:01.845
I never thought of that.

18:03.247 --> 18:05.615
Bunker ?
Mr. Archie bunker ?
Huh ?

18:05.684 --> 18:09.186
<i>You're next.</i>
<i>What do you mean me ? You got</i>
<i>a lot of other people here.</i>

18:09.253 --> 18:11.121
Follow me, please.
Yeah, all right.

18:11.189 --> 18:13.123
I'll be right
with you there, nurse.

18:13.191 --> 18:15.859
Okay, you guys,
I'll see youse later.
[ Chuckling ]

18:18.296 --> 18:20.597
Hey, Lionel.
Come on.

18:20.665 --> 18:23.000
You gave blood before we
got here, didn't you ?

18:23.068 --> 18:26.236
Sure. Why ? Do you think
I sweep up around here ?

18:26.304 --> 18:28.438
Why did you go
and tell him that for ?

18:28.506 --> 18:31.809
You don't know
what trouble you start
when you put him on like that.

18:31.876 --> 18:35.478
Yeah, you're right,
but I just can't resist
the temptation.

18:37.182 --> 18:40.851
Hey, what are you doin' ?
I'm just wiping your arm
with a little alcohol.

18:40.919 --> 18:43.420
Are you all right ?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine. I'm--

18:43.487 --> 18:45.522
sure, sure.
[ Chuckles ]

18:45.590 --> 18:48.058
Like they say, I'm,
uh, fit as a fiddle.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.194
And ready for blood.
Huh ?

18:53.564 --> 18:57.768
Hey. Oh, boy, them needles
are much bigger than they
used to be, ain't they ?

18:57.836 --> 19:01.839
Now make a tight fist.
Yeah, all right.
There. [ Sighs ]

19:03.041 --> 19:05.142
Just, uh, uh, kinda...

19:05.210 --> 19:08.045
Tip me off every step
of the way, you know ?

19:08.113 --> 19:10.914
Like, uh, let me know
when you're about to put
the needle in, huh ?

19:10.982 --> 19:13.316
It is in.
It is in.
Huh ?

19:13.384 --> 19:15.452
Oh, gee.
[ Chuckles ]

19:15.519 --> 19:17.654
Gee, that wasn't nothin',
was it ?

19:17.722 --> 19:20.657
I'll bet you
a lot of guys come in here,
they give you trouble.

19:20.725 --> 19:23.593
They scream at the sight
of the needle and all that ?

19:23.661 --> 19:25.763
Yeah, there's a lot of 'em--
lot of 'em that way.

19:27.065 --> 19:29.233
'Course, those of us
that was in the service,

19:29.300 --> 19:32.236
you know,
w-we're used to it, yeah.

19:32.303 --> 19:35.873
Yeah, I was, uh,
I was in the army air corps...

19:35.940 --> 19:38.041
Over in the war--
the big war.

19:39.210 --> 19:41.411
And I was over there
in foggia, Italy.

19:41.479 --> 19:45.048
Jeez, it's nice
over there, Italy.

19:45.116 --> 19:47.317
You wouldn't be one of
them <i>senoritas,</i> would ya ?

19:56.327 --> 20:00.330
Well, you could be. I mean,
you know, with the dark hair
and the dark eyes and all.

20:02.267 --> 20:05.535
Yeah, that was good times
over there in Italy--
[ Clears throat ]

20:05.603 --> 20:08.238
Meeting some of them
Italian dames over there.

20:08.306 --> 20:10.407
We met 'em through
their families, you know.

20:10.474 --> 20:14.044
"Hey, Joe, you wanna
meet my sister ?"
[ Laughing ]

20:22.553 --> 20:24.554
[ Blood pressure cuff
tears off ]
What's that ?

20:26.657 --> 20:28.725
Nothing.
Just take it easy.
Jeez.

20:28.793 --> 20:30.828
Made a hell of
a noise there.

20:33.131 --> 20:36.099
Let me know, uh,
will ya, when you're
takin' the needle out.

20:36.167 --> 20:37.701
It is out.
Huh ?

20:37.768 --> 20:40.003
It is out.
Already ?

20:40.071 --> 20:43.106
Yes. Now, sit here and
hold this piece of cotton.
Yeah, sure.

20:43.174 --> 20:45.342
Are you all right ?
Yeah, right as rain.

20:45.409 --> 20:48.712
You wanna stand up ?
Yeah, sure, okay.

20:48.779 --> 20:52.482
Tell 'em they can keep
the ambulance in the garage.
Ha-ha-ha-ha !

20:52.550 --> 20:54.617
Yeah, there's no sense
in makin' a fuss...

20:54.685 --> 20:57.754
About takin' a little blood
outta there, huh ?

21:03.161 --> 21:05.395
Is that mine ?
Not anymore.

21:15.606 --> 21:17.707
Here you are, Archie.
Here's some juice.

21:17.775 --> 21:20.010
They say it helps
restore the blood.

21:20.078 --> 21:22.212
All right,
leave it there,
Edith, huh ?

21:22.280 --> 21:24.581
I don't know why
you're so upset.

21:24.648 --> 21:28.752
It's nothing to be
ashamed about, passin' out
at the sight of blood.

21:28.819 --> 21:30.754
Edith, I told you
that ain't it.

21:30.821 --> 21:34.824
My sister used to faint
at spiders in the bathroom.

21:34.893 --> 21:37.627
Because they took too much
outta me. They overdone it.

21:37.695 --> 21:40.697
They left me weak, that's all.
Look at these two arms now.

21:40.765 --> 21:42.766
This one here
is thinner
than that one.

21:44.502 --> 21:47.237
You see that ?
Well--

21:47.305 --> 21:51.008
what do you mean,
"well" ?
It's hard to say.

21:51.075 --> 21:55.412
I don't see your arms
stretched out this way
too often.

21:55.479 --> 21:57.514
Well, I can see it,
even if you don't.

21:57.581 --> 22:00.450
They took too much
outta this one here.

22:00.518 --> 22:02.852
I was hardly able
to stagger home after it.

22:02.921 --> 22:05.923
That's ridiculous, Archie.
They don't make mistakes
like that nowadays.

22:05.990 --> 22:08.792
- They know what they're doin'.
- <i>They</i> know what they're doin'.

22:08.859 --> 22:11.295
But <i>we</i> don't know
what they're doin'.

22:11.362 --> 22:15.799
- What's that supposed to mean ?
- He never did trust doctors.

22:15.866 --> 22:18.668
I think it's because
he don't like to pay 'em.

22:19.804 --> 22:22.205
That ain't it at all !

22:22.273 --> 22:25.075
Just I don't like it
when they take extra blood
outta ya, that's all.

22:25.143 --> 22:27.210
I don't like
a lot of things they do.

22:27.278 --> 22:30.213
- Like what Mike and me
was talkin' about before.
- You mean transplants ?

22:30.281 --> 22:32.916
Yes, I do. Some doctors are
beginning to look at us...

22:32.984 --> 22:35.718
As if we was all
a collection of spare parts.

22:35.786 --> 22:38.355
Oh, now, daddy,
don't get paranoid about it.

22:38.423 --> 22:40.958
Medicine is still dedicated
to keeping us alive.

22:41.025 --> 22:45.228
All right,
but not against <i>his</i> will.

22:46.630 --> 22:49.466
What does <i>his</i> will
got to do with it ?

22:49.533 --> 22:51.801
I ain't talkin' to you !
You're an atheist !

22:51.869 --> 22:55.205
Oh, wait a second.
We're talkin' about
modern medicine here.

22:55.273 --> 22:58.641
We're talkin' about doctors
keepin' us alive.
How did <i>he</i> get into it ?

22:58.709 --> 23:01.278
He was never out of it,
buddy boy.

23:01.346 --> 23:03.580
Life and death
is his business,

23:03.647 --> 23:07.117
and you gotta go
when he calls.

23:07.185 --> 23:10.520
Unless modern medicine
saves you.
<i>It can't.</i>

23:10.588 --> 23:12.856
What do you mean ?
It happens all the time.

23:12.923 --> 23:15.125
That's when he wasn't
really callin'.

23:16.760 --> 23:20.530
But when he really calls,
you gotta go.

23:20.598 --> 23:22.532
And he don't want
no quack doctors down here...

23:22.600 --> 23:27.904
Puttin' other hearts in ya
to keep you here
against his will, is all.

23:27.972 --> 23:31.341
Throws his schedule all off.

23:31.409 --> 23:35.379
You throw his schedule off,
and you're gonna have to answer
for it when you get up there.

23:35.446 --> 23:37.447
Where ?
Heaven, wise guy.

23:37.515 --> 23:41.018
You know damn well what I
was talkin' about. Heaven !

23:41.085 --> 23:43.353
When you get up there,
he's gonna wanna know
from you...

23:43.421 --> 23:45.522
Why you didn't come
when you was called--

23:45.589 --> 23:47.524
why you was late.

23:49.427 --> 23:53.230
You really believe that ?
I certainly do ! And I'll
tell you somethin' else.

23:53.297 --> 23:58.668
You're gonna have
to answer up there to the guy
whose heart you took down here.

23:58.736 --> 24:01.004
Or to her,
if it was a her.

24:02.106 --> 24:04.141
Just let me
finish, huh ?

24:06.010 --> 24:08.078
'Cause that guy's gonna
want his heart back.

24:08.146 --> 24:10.347
Now, you just imagine--
just imagine yourself.

24:10.415 --> 24:14.817
You're up there in heaven,
and you gotta give that heart
back up there, right ?

24:14.885 --> 24:17.820
And now you gotta start
lookin' around
for your old one.

24:19.723 --> 24:21.658
Now, what do you think
you're gonna find ?

24:21.725 --> 24:23.993
You think these doctors
took care of it for you ?

24:24.062 --> 24:26.530
Oh, no.
Not on your life.

24:26.597 --> 24:30.567
They just threw it
into a pail with all the rest
of the spare parts.

24:33.337 --> 24:37.507
Like this.
Your heart's in a pail.

24:37.575 --> 24:41.611
And you're up there in heaven
with a hole in your chest.

24:50.521 --> 24:52.889
Your turn, daddy.

24:52.957 --> 24:55.758
Oh, gee ! Mm !

24:55.826 --> 25:00.663
- Still hurts, huh, daddy ?
- Yeah, I'll be all right
when the weather gets warmer.

25:00.731 --> 25:04.000
Meantime, I'll
roll 'em lefty. Ah.

25:04.068 --> 25:06.669
Hey, move for me,
will ya, Edith.
Go ahead.

25:06.737 --> 25:10.039
Oh, you got a chance.
Yeah. Well, all right,
pick the card there.

25:13.377 --> 25:16.480
Oh, Archie.
Read the card, Edith.

25:18.716 --> 25:20.717
"Go to jail."

25:24.788 --> 25:26.856
"Go directly to jail.
Do not pass--"

25:26.924 --> 25:29.859
all right. You don't
have to read it all !
Put me in there !

25:40.904 --> 25:44.407

25:51.616 --> 25:56.786
