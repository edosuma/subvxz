Where is she?

27:39.369 --> 27:41.287
Poor girl!

27:41.329 --> 27:42.956
We've pumped
her stomach,

27:43.039 --> 27:45.833
It's almost impossible
to take a lethal overdose

27:45.917 --> 27:47.460
in this family of drug,

27:47.501 --> 27:48.836

Well, honey,
it was my house she came to,

28:17.779 --> 28:19.156
Well, she probably
assumed

28:19.239 --> 28:21.116

cook you dinner,

Why does Patsy's
friendship with Melanie

29:17.793 --> 29:19.794
bother you so much?

29:19.920 --> 29:22.547
Melly was 3 when
my daughter Emma died,

29:22.589 --> 29:24.382
Patsy was Emma's
best friend

29:24.382 --> 29:25.800
and worst influence,

29:25.883 --> 29:29.637
After Emma was gone, Patsy felt
that she should raise Melly,

29:29.762 --> 29:31.138
and I would not
have it,

29:31.263 --> 29:34.058
She thinks that she
could have done a better job

29:34.141 --> 29:35.517
than I did,

29:35.559 --> 29:37.811
But I did the best
that I could,

29:37.894 --> 29:39.688
I wanted her
to appreciate life,

29:39.813 --> 29:42.690
I wanted her to be
responsible,

29:42.732 --> 29:45.485

the essential things,

it's like, um,,,

30:06.212 --> 30:08.506
it's like composing
a symphony,

30:08.547 --> 30:13.302
I tried to write a symphony
when I was about 18,

30:13.344 --> 30:15.220
I love music,

30:15.304 --> 30:18.515
But I... I... I, um,
I never finished it,

30:18.557 --> 30:20.934
Well, you should,

30:21.059 --> 30:24.812

something behind, isn't it?

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:00.704
And I knew they would,

01:04:00.787 --> 01:04:03.915
His acting teacher says
he's like an open wound,

01:04:03.999 --> 01:04:05.792
He's up for
a beer commercial,

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.294
I'm really happy,

01:04:08.419 --> 01:04:10.546
Melanie,
I hate this,

01:04:10.588 --> 01:04:12.214
I hate that you're
going away again,

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.966
I never know
where you are,

01:04:13.966 --> 01:04:15.342
I worry
all the time,

01:04:15.509 --> 01:04:17.261
I have to go through Patsy
to get to you,

01:04:17.344 --> 01:04:18.428
I really hate that,

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:19.680
O, K,

01:04:21.139 --> 01:04:22.766
I'll give you
my phone number,

01:04:24.059 --> 01:04:26.769
If you'll promise me
you'll never ever use it,

01:04:30.231 --> 01:04:32.066
I promise,

01:04:40.407 --> 01:04:41.408
Finally,

01:04:43.785 --> 01:04:44.786
You're so late!

01:04:44.911 --> 01:04:45.787
I know,

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.915
Is everything O, K,?

01:04:48.998 --> 01:04:49.957
Mel?

01:04:49.957 --> 01:04:51.334
Yeah?

01:04:51.459 --> 01:04:52.960
There's something
I gotta tell you,

01:04:53.044 --> 01:04:54.503
Yeah?

01:04:56.547 --> 01:04:57.840
I got the commercial,

01:04:57.965 --> 01:04:59.883
Ah!
You did?!

01:05:00.967 --> 01:05:02.135
That is so good,
honey,

01:05:02.302 --> 01:05:03.094
Yeah,

01:05:05.847 --> 01:05:07.599
So are you the beer drinker
in the ski parka

01:05:07.682 --> 01:05:09.517
or the one
in the Speedo?

01:05:09.517 --> 01:05:10.434
Speedo,

01:05:11.644 --> 01:05:13.104
They're no fools,

01:05:14.396 --> 01:05:16.815
Oh, it's so good
to be home,

01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:25.740
Mel?

01:05:25.782 --> 01:05:27.408
The whole point
of us coming to L, A,

01:05:27.408 --> 01:05:29.118
was to make a new start,

01:05:29.118 --> 01:05:30.620
I've been meaning
to talk to you

01:05:30.703 --> 01:05:32.580
about this for
a few weeks now,

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.707
But... But then,
Hector died

01:05:34.748 --> 01:05:37.334
and you were
so bummed out, so,,,

01:05:44.215 --> 01:05:46.301
Does it have a name?

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:47.510
Yeah,

01:05:49.053 --> 01:05:50.638
She um,,,

01:05:50.638 --> 01:05:52.640
She's helped me
a lot with my career,

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:58.061
Bruce,
do you have any idea

01:05:58.061 --> 01:06:00.230
what this
does to me?

01:06:00.355 --> 01:06:02.399
Yeah, I think I do,

01:06:02.482 --> 01:06:04.609
I think I do, but,,,

01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:06.361
it's not aimed
at you, Mel,

01:06:06.361 --> 01:06:08.613
It may not be
aimed at me,

01:06:08.613 --> 01:06:10.781
but it hits me,
and it hurts,

01:06:10.781 --> 01:06:12.408
Shit!

01:06:12.491 --> 01:06:14.368
This means Granny
was right,

01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:16.120
I could just
kill you!

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.454
Just get out!

01:06:17.538 --> 01:06:18.413
O, K,

01:06:20.707 --> 01:06:22.667
Can I ask you
something?

01:06:22.667 --> 01:06:24.085
What?!

01:06:24.085 --> 01:06:27.088
I didn't get a chance
to forward my Varieties,

01:06:27.088 --> 01:06:30.383
and I need them for audition
notices, Can you hold onto them?

01:06:30.466 --> 01:06:31.592
Out!

01:06:31.634 --> 01:06:33.219
Thanks,

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.638
Ooh!

01:06:55.155 --> 01:06:56.156
Hi,

01:06:56.156 --> 01:06:57.491
Remember me?

01:06:57.533 --> 01:06:59.159
I'm Patsy,

01:07:00.619 --> 01:07:03.705
I don't think I've met
anybody quite like you,

01:07:03.788 --> 01:07:05.248
Patsy Carpenter,

01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:08.042
Why?

01:07:09.085 --> 01:07:11.837
A bored, rich
Houston divorcee?

01:07:13.381 --> 01:07:15.257
Oh, well, Ha ha,

01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:17.134
We're not exactly
a rare breed,

01:07:17.259 --> 01:07:20.012
I tend to stay away
from upper class women,

01:07:20.095 --> 01:07:22.180
They scare me,

01:07:24.182 --> 01:07:25.934
Make me feel
uncomfortable,

01:07:26.017 --> 01:07:27.393
I'm hardly upper class,

01:07:27.435 --> 01:07:30.146
You know, I'm just
a poor little old Texas gal,

01:07:30.354 --> 01:07:32.565
Struck oil
at the altar,

01:07:35.192 --> 01:07:37.736
Now,,, Aurora,,,

01:07:37.861 --> 01:07:39.696
she's upper class,

01:07:39.738 --> 01:07:41.615
Yeah, she is,

01:07:41.698 --> 01:07:44.492
Do you feel
uncomfortable with her?

01:07:44.659 --> 01:07:46.494
Well, I,,,

01:07:46.494 --> 01:07:49.247
I don't know what's going on
with Aurora right now,

01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:50.706
It's...

01:07:50.832 --> 01:07:52.958
Well, let's just say
it's complicated,

01:07:54.668 --> 01:07:55.753
I'll bet,

01:08:03.009 --> 01:08:04.135
Trouble?

01:08:05.887 --> 01:08:08.681
Well, I'm not really
at liberty to discuss her,

01:08:08.806 --> 01:08:10.600
She is a patient,

01:08:10.766 --> 01:08:12.685
Oh!

01:08:12.768 --> 01:08:16.145
The old
doctor/ patient thing,

01:08:16.188 --> 01:08:17.106
Yeah,

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:21.693
But you're not really
a doctor, are you?

01:08:21.818 --> 01:08:24.738
That's right,
I'm not,

01:08:24.863 --> 01:08:27.657
But I do try to
follow the rules,

01:08:27.698 --> 01:08:29.533
Hear no evil,
Speak no evil,

01:08:29.658 --> 01:08:31.285
Do no evil?

01:08:35.413 --> 01:08:37.416
You're fascinating,

01:08:37.416 --> 01:08:38.667
No,

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:40.669
You're fascinating,

01:08:41.837 --> 01:08:43.964
It's fascinating,,,

01:08:44.005 --> 01:08:47.300
that a man like you should be
sleeping with a woman

01:08:47.383 --> 01:08:49.551
who's old enough
to be,,,

01:08:49.594 --> 01:08:51.053
your mother,

01:08:53.055 --> 01:08:54.140
Bottoms up,

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:02.564
So what does the rest
of the house look like?

01:09:02.647 --> 01:09:04.649
Why don't you
follow me?

01:09:07.068 --> 01:09:09.237
I haven't heard
from Melanie,

01:09:09.362 --> 01:09:12.238
and nothing compels me
to return to my therapist,

01:09:12.238 --> 01:09:15.201
I haven't seen much of Patsy,
either, thank God,

01:09:15.242 --> 01:09:17.118
Rosie is becoming
extremely difficult,

01:09:17.202 --> 01:09:20.037
I think it might be
because Hector's gone,

01:09:20.037 --> 01:09:21.581
That's no great loss,

01:09:21.665 --> 01:09:23.082
How can you say that?

01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:25.502
Hector loved you
and you loved him,

01:09:25.585 --> 01:09:29.630
If I heard "The military'd
straighten Tommy out" one more time,

01:09:29.756 --> 01:09:31.549
I'd have killed him
myself,

01:09:31.631 --> 01:09:33.551
Tell me how it works,
Tommy,

01:09:33.634 --> 01:09:37.095
When someone that you hate dies,
like the General,

01:09:37.136 --> 01:09:41.015
does the hatred that you feel
for that person dissipate,

01:09:41.099 --> 01:09:44.435
or do you transfer it
to someone else,,,

01:09:44.435 --> 01:09:45.310
like me?

01:09:45.395 --> 01:09:47.229
Would you explain this
to me, please?

01:09:47.313 --> 01:09:50.441
Because I do not understand
hatred as a sport,

01:09:50.441 --> 01:09:51.817
How does one win?

01:09:52.902 --> 01:09:54.862
Hey, eXcuse me,

01:09:54.987 --> 01:09:56.655
Sit down,

01:10:01.159 --> 01:10:03.036
Now do me a favor,

01:10:03.036 --> 01:10:04.996
I enjoy cooking
those brownies,

01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:06.331
That is my recipe,

01:10:06.414 --> 01:10:09.959
I have spent many years
perfecting it to get it right,

01:10:10.001 --> 01:10:12.962
I consider these brownies
to be the finest

01:10:13.045 --> 01:10:14.505
in the whole world,

01:10:14.505 --> 01:10:17.341
Please do not throw these brownies
away in front of me,

01:10:17.341 --> 01:10:20.302
You can take them and throw them
away after I'm gone

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:21.762
if you want to,

01:10:21.845 --> 01:10:24.889
Just so you know,
I've put a file inside,

01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:38.569
Whatcha got?

01:10:38.652 --> 01:10:40.404
Merry Christmas,

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:44.004
If I could fly
like birds on high

01:11:44.087 --> 01:11:45.880
Then straight to
her arms

01:11:46.089 --> 01:11:47.507
I'd go sailing

01:11:47.715 --> 01:11:48.716
Jerry,

01:11:50.259 --> 01:11:51.636
Jerry,

01:11:51.636 --> 01:11:53.179
Aurora?

01:11:53.262 --> 01:11:54.680
Yes,

01:11:54.805 --> 01:11:56.640
Tommy took the brownies,

01:11:56.682 --> 01:11:58.308
Ha ha,

01:11:58.392 --> 01:11:59.810
Tommy did what?

01:12:00.018 --> 01:12:01.978
He took the brownies,
Ha ha!

01:12:01.978 --> 01:12:03.813
That's great,
Hey, I'll be right out,

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:04.981
O, K,

01:12:19.786 --> 01:12:20.704
Aurora?

01:12:20.746 --> 01:12:22.080
Where are you?

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.540
I'm so glad you came...

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.000
[Wheels
Screech]

01:12:27.502 --> 01:12:28.836
Oh, Patsy!

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.254
Oh!

01:12:30.338 --> 01:12:32.089
I'm so sorry
I'm a little late,

01:12:32.256 --> 01:12:35.050
Oh, no! Listen,
I was just so glad you called,

01:12:35.134 --> 01:12:36.218
Oh, thank you,

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.887
I decided it had just been
too long, you know?

01:12:39.012 --> 01:12:40.597
It's so hot in here,
though,

01:12:40.597 --> 01:12:42.641
Aren't you warm? Whoo!

01:12:42.641 --> 01:12:44.100
It's very warm in here,

01:12:44.184 --> 01:12:46.519
Could I have some iced-tea,
please? Thank you,

01:12:46.603 --> 01:12:48.396
Would you like
iced-tea?

01:12:50.898 --> 01:12:52.358
Uh,,,

01:12:52.358 --> 01:12:53.567
Bloody Mary,

01:12:53.567 --> 01:12:54.735
Lotsa Mary,

01:12:54.819 --> 01:12:57.696
So now tell me everything
that you've been up to,

01:12:57.696 --> 01:13:00.282
and don't leave out a thing,
I wanna catch up,

01:13:00.407 --> 01:13:02.284
Have you heard
from Melly?

01:13:02.284 --> 01:13:03.285
No, Oh... Melly?

01:13:03.285 --> 01:13:04.286
Uh...

01:13:04.411 --> 01:13:07.038
Oh, it's Jerry!
Ooh, I see Jerry, One second,

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.956
I will get him
and bring him in,

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.958
My mother'll ask
for Bruckner, Thank you,

01:13:11.042 --> 01:13:11.918
Jerry,

01:13:12.001 --> 01:13:12.835
Aurora,

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.420
I'm so glad
you called,

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:17.214
'cause I have
a big surprise for you,

01:13:17.256 --> 01:13:19.216
Oh, really?
Oh, I revel in surprises,

01:13:19.216 --> 01:13:20.592
Great,

01:13:20.717 --> 01:13:22.469
You remember
my very good friend Patsy?

01:13:25.346 --> 01:13:26.431
Of course,

01:13:26.556 --> 01:13:30.309
We met at Melanie's,,,
going-away party,

01:13:32.186 --> 01:13:33.646
Hi, Patsy,
How you been?

01:13:33.729 --> 01:13:35.147
Hi, Jerry,

01:13:35.231 --> 01:13:36.732
Sit down, Jerry,

01:13:39.318 --> 01:13:41.153
You'll be
needing this,

01:13:41.236 --> 01:13:44.489
I think you should order
the pasta primavera here,

01:13:44.489 --> 01:13:46.866
It is to die for,

01:13:46.908 --> 01:13:48.368
[Giggling]

01:13:48.451 --> 01:13:50.244
Sounds good!

01:13:50.369 --> 01:13:51.245
Mm-hmm,

01:13:51.287 --> 01:13:52.913
Oh,

01:13:56.667 --> 01:13:57.543
So,,,

01:13:57.668 --> 01:14:00.587
how long have you two
been fucking?

01:14:05.592 --> 01:14:09.178
Aurora, let's get
a couple of things straight,

01:14:09.345 --> 01:14:11.180
You walked out on me,
Talk to me,

01:14:11.305 --> 01:14:12.932
Patsy I have to
talk to again,

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:15.768
because that is the wretched hand
that life has dealt me,

01:14:15.768 --> 01:14:17.186
You are not
in the cards,

01:14:17.311 --> 01:14:18.312
Hi, honey!

01:14:20.897 --> 01:14:22.315
You must be Aurora,

01:14:31.032 --> 01:14:32.533
Surprised?

Oh, my God,

Oh, how extraordinary
to meet you!

01:14:38.789 --> 01:14:40.040
Thank you,

01:14:40.207 --> 01:14:41.208
Well,,,

01:14:41.249 --> 01:14:44.002
it's obvious to me now
why Jerry has said

01:14:44.044 --> 01:14:46.045
the things
that he has said,

01:14:47.797 --> 01:14:49.257
Physician,,,

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.342
heal thyself,

01:14:54.136 --> 01:14:55.012
Aurora?

01:14:58.557 --> 01:14:59.808
Let's eat, Come on,

01:14:59.891 --> 01:15:02.102
She's very pretty,
honey,

01:15:02.352 --> 01:15:05.480
Ah, my life, my life,

01:15:05.647 --> 01:15:07.690
[Moans]

01:15:10.902 --> 01:15:12.236
Dear, sweet, Rosie,

01:15:12.361 --> 01:15:14.238
You old dear,

01:15:14.238 --> 01:15:16.990
What did I ever do
to deserve you?

01:15:17.032 --> 01:15:19.451
I been askin' myself
the same thing,

01:15:19.618 --> 01:15:21.411
[Moans]

01:15:21.453 --> 01:15:22.496
Rosie,,,

01:15:23.955 --> 01:15:26.249
let's take a trip,

01:15:26.332 --> 01:15:28.209
I need a change
of scenery,

01:15:28.209 --> 01:15:30.545
Nothing extravagant,

01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:32.004
but wouldn't you...

01:15:32.088 --> 01:15:34.882
wouldn't you like
to see some great art?

01:15:34.965 --> 01:15:36.967
Oh, a symphony, perhaps,

01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:40.679
We must think
about this, Rosie,

01:15:43.098 --> 01:15:44.683
I'm quitting, Aurora,

01:15:48.853 --> 01:15:50.229
EXcuse me?

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:52.648
I have to,

01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:55.734
Arthur's asked me
to marry him,

01:15:57.069 --> 01:16:00.155
If I do,
he won't let me work,

01:16:24.844 --> 01:16:26.679
Marry Arthur,,,

01:16:26.763 --> 01:16:28.681
for what purpose?

01:16:28.681 --> 01:16:31.642
Well, things haven't been
so good around here, lately,

01:16:31.642 --> 01:16:34.186
I felt like
you might want me to go,

01:16:35.854 --> 01:16:37.815
So you're giving me
your notice?

01:16:40.192 --> 01:16:42.486
I've never considered
you my boss,

01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:44.779
I've considered you
my friend,

01:16:46.781 --> 01:16:48.241
I'm lucky,

01:16:48.366 --> 01:16:50.159
I've never had
kids of my own,

01:16:50.159 --> 01:16:53.537
but I feel like
I've raised some,

01:16:53.579 --> 01:16:55.456
Your life,,,

01:16:55.539 --> 01:16:57.166
has been my life,

01:17:01.294 --> 01:17:03.338
Arthur says
he loves me,

01:17:03.505 --> 01:17:05.882
You've heard that
a lot,

01:17:06.090 --> 01:17:07.884
I never have,

01:17:07.884 --> 01:17:11.262
Do you know what it's like
to be my age

01:17:11.345 --> 01:17:14.265
and never have had
someone turn to you

01:17:14.265 --> 01:17:16.558
and say,,,

01:17:16.642 --> 01:17:18.435
"I love you"?

01:17:20.437 --> 01:17:22.189
Arthur said that to me,

01:17:24.316 --> 01:17:25.733
I'm old,

01:17:25.733 --> 01:17:28.152
I'm tired,

01:17:28.152 --> 01:17:30.738
But he wants me
as I am,

01:17:31.948 --> 01:17:33.908
I can't walk away
from that,

01:17:38.704 --> 01:17:41.081
Besides,
I'll be next door,

01:18:45.807 --> 01:18:48.184
[Ring]

01:18:53.397 --> 01:18:54.565
Hello?

01:18:57.151 --> 01:18:58.318
Granny?

01:18:58.318 --> 01:18:59.236
Ah!

01:18:59.319 --> 01:19:01.530
Oh, Melly!

01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:03.490
Oh, Mel!

01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:05.909
Well, darling,
the bad experiences

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:09.037
are as important
as the good ones,

01:19:09.162 --> 01:19:11.455
I mean,
I was in Jerry's life

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:14.458
because, apparently,
he needed to work through

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:16.460
some dreary episode
with his mother,

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:18.462
And I haven't yet
figured out

01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:20.339
why we're all blessed
with Patsy,

01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:24.592
I'm just so disappointed
in myself,

01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:27.428
Never allow
disappointment, Mel,

01:19:27.428 --> 01:19:29.347
Disappointment
ruins more lives

01:19:29.347 --> 01:19:32.933
than all the diseases
known to man,

01:19:33.059 --> 01:19:35.185
Get back in the saddle
again, honey,

01:19:35.311 --> 01:19:37.980
No way, I can't
let this happen again,

01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:41.191
I seem to have this pattern
going on here,

01:19:41.316 --> 01:19:43.318
Well, I'm finding
that the only way

01:19:43.318 --> 01:19:47.113
to break bad behavior patterns
is to break them,

01:19:47.113 --> 01:19:49.490
Anyway, Mel,
men come and go,

01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:53.202
And if you're lucky, the good ones
come and go several times,

01:19:56.789 --> 01:19:58.582
Come home, Mel,

01:19:58.582 --> 01:20:00.000
Are you kidding?

01:20:00.167 --> 01:20:02.419
I can't do that,

01:20:04.379 --> 01:20:06.297
Well, could we
do something?

01:20:06.381 --> 01:20:08.216
Could we go somewhere?

01:20:08.216 --> 01:20:11.552
I've always dreamed of
taking you kids to New York,

01:20:11.636 --> 01:20:13.929
New York is such
a wonderful place

01:20:13.929 --> 01:20:16.849
with the theater and the ballet
and the museums,

01:20:16.932 --> 01:20:18.350
no Bruce,

01:20:18.517 --> 01:20:20.686
Ha,

01:20:20.769 --> 01:20:22.604
Someday, O, K,?

01:20:22.687 --> 01:20:24.064
But not now,

01:20:25.482 --> 01:20:27.483
I'm so glad
you called, Mel,

01:20:29.318 --> 01:20:31.696
I've never needed
anything more, honey,

01:20:31.779 --> 01:20:34.657
Maybe I'll do it
again sometime,

01:20:36.617 --> 01:20:37.409
Bye, hon,

01:20:38.619 --> 01:20:39.870
Bye, Granny,

01:20:48.086 --> 01:20:49.462
Did he dump you?

01:20:49.545 --> 01:20:51.214
Yeah,

01:20:51.297 --> 01:20:52.631
Good,

01:21:15.736 --> 01:21:17.029
Melanie Horton?

01:21:17.029 --> 01:21:19.781
Yeah, That's me, Hi,

01:21:24.035 --> 01:21:26.538
I guess we have
to take them back,

01:21:26.579 --> 01:21:28.998
No! I want,
I want to keep them,

01:21:29.082 --> 01:21:30.333
I've already named them,

01:21:30.333 --> 01:21:34.211
and if I take them back,

01:21:34.295 --> 01:21:37.881
somebody'll change their names
and confuse them,

01:21:49.017 --> 01:21:50.434
Miss Horton?

01:21:50.518 --> 01:21:52.103
Yeah?

01:21:52.186 --> 01:21:54.480
We'd like you
to try it again,

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.357
Why? I was terrible,

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.066
Don't worry,
This is television,

01:21:58.108 --> 01:22:00.235
They love your look,

01:22:00.235 --> 01:22:02.654
You got to do something
with the character,

01:22:02.779 --> 01:22:06.366
She has to be outrageous,
unpredictable,

01:22:06.407 --> 01:22:08.910
Faith is a person you want
to love sometimes,

01:22:08.951 --> 01:22:10.161
and the next time

01:22:10.244 --> 01:22:12.496
you want
to strangle her,

01:22:12.538 --> 01:22:15.583
So, take a minute
and think about it...

01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:18.919
I got it, I know,
I got, I got it,

01:22:18.919 --> 01:22:21.713
O, K, All right,

Oh, Melanie,

Oh, hi,

01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:37.061
What?

01:22:38.145 --> 01:22:39.605
Television?

01:22:42.399 --> 01:22:43.900
Mel?

01:22:44.943 --> 01:22:46.402
Congratulations, honey!

01:22:46.402 --> 01:22:47.737
This is fantastic,
Melanie,

01:22:47.779 --> 01:22:51.115
Oh, I'm so happy
for you, honey,

01:22:51.157 --> 01:22:54.743
It is a big part,
isn't it?

01:22:59.289 --> 01:23:00.707
Thank you,

01:23:00.749 --> 01:23:02.584
You know,
it's hard to believe

01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:03.543
you're Melanie's
grandmother,

01:23:03.668 --> 01:23:05.628
When did you
get married, 12?

01:23:10.341 --> 01:23:12.343
I love L, A,

01:23:12.468 --> 01:23:14.887
Yeah, but what time
will you be home?

01:23:15.012 --> 01:23:16.347
Hell if I know,

01:23:19.141 --> 01:23:20.600
Bye,

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:21.601

01:23:38.158 --> 01:23:40.494
Bravo!

01:23:40.535 --> 01:23:42.287
That was great,

01:23:42.496 --> 01:23:45.081
So here it is,
my dressing room,

[Whispering] Melanie,
Oh, my God,

Oh, honey, Oh, Mel,

01:23:50.711 --> 01:23:52.129
Granny, what is the matter?

01:23:52.254 --> 01:23:53.214
Oh, God,

01:23:53.255 --> 01:23:54.715

01:23:54.798 --> 01:23:56.800
Oh, my goodness,

01:23:56.842 --> 01:23:59.094
Do you know how rare
it is to share

01:23:59.219 --> 01:24:00.387
pure moments
of triumph

01:24:00.429 --> 01:24:02.931
and of joy
in this family?

01:24:04.599 --> 01:24:07.018
Oh, Mel,
How far you've come,

01:24:07.101 --> 01:24:08.311
How much
you've accomplished,

01:24:08.353 --> 01:24:11.731
Just think,
less than a year ago,

01:24:11.731 --> 01:24:14.567
you were lying in a hospital
near death,

01:24:14.692 --> 01:24:16.735
And now you're
on television,

01:24:20.364 --> 01:24:23.533

to this precious moment

as I possibly can,

'cause the opera
benefit's in 2 weeks,

Oh, God, I should never
have said I'd be chairman,

'cause it seems
they can't even breathe

without my say-so,

They even want me to tell 'em
how to fold the napkins,

Who gives a shit?

01:25:32.305 --> 01:25:34.431
Are you mad at me,
Aurora?

01:25:36.767 --> 01:25:38.435
I'm,,, tired of you, Patsy,

01:25:38.519 --> 01:25:41.146
I'm just so tired of you
meddling in my life,

01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:44.858
I would just love it if I could
do something... one thing, anything,

01:25:44.858 --> 01:25:46.693
I don't care what it is...

01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:48.236
where you are not there

01:25:48.236 --> 01:25:50.238
either stealing it
or spoiling it,

01:25:52.239 --> 01:25:53.699
Well, you know?

01:25:55.409 --> 01:25:57.536
I don't think my generosity
and support

01:25:57.661 --> 01:25:59.538
would
bother you so much

01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:01.957
if you weren't such
a miserable, unhappy

01:26:01.998 --> 01:26:04.584
bag of bile,

01:26:07.170 --> 01:26:10.089
Generosity? I am so sick
of your talking

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:12.008
about your generosity,

01:26:12.091 --> 01:26:15.844
There is not a generous
tuck in your entire body,

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:18.096
I'm sorry you see
it as meddling,

01:26:18.138 --> 01:26:19.890
It's healthier than
your emotional terrorism,

01:26:20.015 --> 01:26:22.517
Emotional terrorism?
Where did you pick that up?

01:26:22.559 --> 01:26:25.478
Are you sleeping
with some CNN reporter now?

01:26:25.478 --> 01:26:28.231
Oh, get off your moral
high horse,

01:26:30.233 --> 01:26:31.067
You run around

01:26:31.108 --> 01:26:32.818
like a piece
of activated sewage,

01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:35.195
and you have the nerve
to criticize what I do?

01:26:35.237 --> 01:26:36.780
I'm honest
in my relationships,

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:39.616
At least I don't lie,
and I don't back-stab,

01:26:39.658 --> 01:26:41.118
This is about Jerry,
isn't it?

01:26:41.201 --> 01:26:42.202
This is about
Melanie!

01:26:42.285 --> 01:26:44.454
Oh, please, Aurora,
That again?

01:26:44.537 --> 01:26:46.581
You did not
get to raise her,

01:26:46.789 --> 01:26:48.583
You have spent
your life, therefore,

01:26:48.583 --> 01:26:50.585
trying to snatch her
away from me,

01:26:50.751 --> 01:26:52.545
Emma wanted me
to raise her,

01:26:52.712 --> 01:26:55.089
Oh, yes, so that
she would turn out

01:26:55.130 --> 01:26:56.340

your children...

didn't go to prison to escape me,

be perfect,

but they are alive,
and they feel,

01:27:10.895 --> 01:27:12.104
and I love them,

01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:15.232
and I'm going to love them
until I die,

01:27:15.316 --> 01:27:16.734
That is all that I want,

01:27:16.859 --> 01:27:19.611

you regard me as the enemy,

They keep
you strong,

01:27:27.869 --> 01:27:32.415

hates you so much,

Uh-huh, Well, we have had
the most wonderful news over here,

been through too much,

01:43:24.496 --> 01:43:26.331
Nope, I don't mind
gettin' old,

01:43:26.414 --> 01:43:28.541
I think it's our
greatest accomplishment,

01:43:30.751 --> 01:43:33.045
The simple feat
of getting through

01:43:33.129 --> 01:43:35.464
everything that happens to us
is awesome,

01:43:35.547 --> 01:43:38.300
It,,, has a kind of,,,

01:43:38.509 --> 01:43:40.719
perverse majesty,

01:43:41.761 --> 01:43:43.680
Careful, Garrett,

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.515
Your soul is showing,

01:43:46.849 --> 01:43:50.937
I only want to feel
that I have done something,

01:43:51.062 --> 01:43:52.688
You have,

01:43:52.813 --> 01:43:54.064
Trust me,

01:43:54.231 --> 01:43:55.983
That's so easy
for you to say,

01:43:56.066 --> 01:43:59.820
You've done so many wonderful,
monumental things,

01:43:59.987 --> 01:44:01.780
You've walked on
the moon,

01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:03.198
Sure,

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:06.618
And you've walked on

01:44:21.089 --> 01:44:23.383

01:44:23.508 --> 01:44:28.638
She shines first,
she shines brightest,

01:44:28.638 --> 01:44:31.265
and she shines

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.563
Make a wish,

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:40.399
Astronauts are trained
to not wish on stars,

01:44:40.482 --> 01:44:42.400
They'd never get
anything done,

01:44:42.484 --> 01:44:44.235
Mmm, Do it,

01:44:49.282 --> 01:44:50.158
O, K,,,

I hope you're wishing that I
get to my flight on time,

01:45:16.682 --> 01:45:18.058
Mmm!

01:45:18.141 --> 01:45:20.936
Aurora, you couldn't
possibly live long enough

01:45:21.019 --> 01:45:22.812
for that wish
to come true,

01:45:26.733 --> 01:45:28.568
That doesn't matter,

01:45:33.114 --> 01:45:33.906

O, K,

Ah, yes,

01:47:04.489 --> 01:47:05.782
I love you,

01:47:06.908 --> 01:47:09.660
That would be
just like you, Garrett,

01:47:14.665 --> 01:47:15.541
Yep,

01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:56.245
That's some good
art, Bump,

01:47:56.412 --> 01:47:57.204

there are rewards
to having an enemy?
