We're the Seabees
of the navy

00:16.713 --> 00:20.248
we can build
or we can fight

00:20.281 --> 00:24.375
we'll pave the way
to victory

00:24.409 --> 00:27.975
and guard it
day and night

00:28.009 --> 00:31.528
and we promise
that we'll remember

00:31.561 --> 00:35.095
the 7th of December

00:35.129 --> 00:39.287
we're the Seabees
of the navy

00:39.321 --> 00:44.008
bees of the seven seas

01:12.327 --> 01:15.896
Ding!
Where's Ryan?

01:15.929 --> 01:17.687
You see Wedge?

01:17.721 --> 01:20.088
I can't hear you!
Hi, Wedge!

01:20.121 --> 01:22.487
Ryan!

01:27.287 --> 01:30.296
Oh, I’m sorry. It's quite
all right. Excuse me.

01:36.296 --> 01:39.288
Bob!
Oh, I am sorry.

01:39.896 --> 01:41.687
Let's not make this
a habit.

01:41.721 --> 01:43.495
The lady's difficult.

01:47.095 --> 01:51.287
Excuse me.
Bob!

01:53.655 --> 01:55.448
Sorry, you can't come
through here. It's all right.

01:55.481 --> 01:57.847
I'm Connie Chesley,
inter-ocean news service.

01:57.881 --> 01:59.656
Please to meet you. I'm Ben
Hedburg. So what, cookie?

02:00.248 --> 02:02.055
It's all right, Coxswain. You
can let us through. Yes, sir.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.456
Hello.
Connie.

02:05.656 --> 02:07.447
How are you? Just wonderful, darling.

02:07.481 --> 02:08.648
And you?
Good.

02:25.447 --> 02:28.456
Mr. Collins, Rollie. How
are ya? How are you, Wedge?

02:28.489 --> 02:30.247
Yump, how are ya?

02:30.281 --> 02:33.848
Glad to see ya, Brick.
Hans, good to see you.

02:33.881 --> 02:35.655
Where's Denny Ryan?

02:35.689 --> 02:38.648
Denny ain't comin' back.

02:39.256 --> 02:44.056
Anyone else? Evans, burns and Long Louie.

02:44.089 --> 02:46.455
Where's Johnson?
Hello, Wedge.

02:46.489 --> 02:49.447
Hello, fella.

02:49.481 --> 02:51.848
Well, this one's
nearest my heart, anyhow.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.855
What happened?
They wouldn't give us any guns.

02:57.256 --> 03:00.247
We wanted to fight, but we didn't have
no chance. They wouldn't give us guns.

03:00.281 --> 03:03.847
Who wouldn't
give you guns?

03:03.881 --> 03:05.655
That gold braid over there.

03:08.056 --> 03:10.455
The Japs sneaked in a landing party,
infiltrated our covering posts,

03:10.489 --> 03:12.248
and then
rushed the workmen.

03:12.856 --> 03:14.647
The workmen?

03:14.681 --> 03:17.608
You see, they're technicians who
couldn't be replaced within 7,000 miles.

03:17.641 --> 03:20.615
Getting them means more to the
Japs than getting us, out there.

03:23.016 --> 03:26.007
Something ought to be done about
this, bob. Something will be done.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.015
And I mean to see that it's done
- mister?

03:29.049 --> 03:32.008
I gave you a gang of men to
build an airfield in the pacific.

03:32.041 --> 03:35.015
They were whole men.
Take a look at 'em now!

03:35.049 --> 03:38.007
I hope you can sleep nights. Aren't
you mixing your pronouns a little?

03:38.041 --> 03:41.015
Didn't you refuse them arms to
protect themselves? That's right.

03:41.048 --> 03:45.127
And I’m not apologizing for it.
Apologies won't bring back my men.

03:45.161 --> 03:46.887
Are you Donovan?
Yes.

03:46.921 --> 03:49.288
You're just the man I
want to see. About what?

03:49.321 --> 03:51.512
About what's eating you
right now.

03:51.545 --> 03:54.296
I didn't arm your men because civilians
found armed are shot like spies.

03:54.329 --> 03:56.695
It's a rule of war. What do
you think happened to them?

03:56.729 --> 04:00.295
I know what happened to them. That's
why the rules have to be changed.

04:00.329 --> 04:03.288
We're not fighting men anymore.
We're fighting animals.

04:03.321 --> 04:06.295
I want your men armed in
the future, legally armed,

04:06.329 --> 04:09.287
and I’ll need
your help to do it.

04:09.321 --> 04:12.295
Well, on second thought, I
guess you don't make the rules.

04:12.328 --> 04:14.647
Keep talking, sailor.

04:14.681 --> 04:17.047
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Yarrow.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.856
This is Miss Chesley.

04:18.889 --> 04:20.647
I'd like to talk to you about
this as soon as possible.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.048
Could you join us for
dinner? Well, I can't.

04:23.081 --> 04:27.527
I'm giving a welcome-home party
for my men at the St. George.

04:27.561 --> 04:30.535
Why don't you two join
us? We could talk then.

04:32.327 --> 04:34.727
Fine. We'll be there. I'll
be expecting you around 9:00.

04:35.335 --> 04:37.127
Right.

04:39.160 --> 04:42.055
And so, to you gentlemen of the
Donovan construction company,

04:42.648 --> 04:46.215
who have been so devoted,
so unbegrudging,

04:46.249 --> 04:49.815
so stuffy, so-

04:54.007 --> 04:57.015

04:57.608 --> 05:00.007

05:10.840 --> 05:13.815
Where do you push-a, John
on the Delaware Lackawann'

05:13.849 --> 05:16.808

05:34.840 --> 05:36.616
and after the war is gone

05:36.649 --> 05:38.407
there's plenty more work to be done yea

05:45.048 --> 05:46.807
and what do you
like to eat

05:46.841 --> 05:49.815
I am crazy for caviar
but I haven't got caviar?

05:50.408 --> 05:52.807
So I eat anything there are yea

05:52.841 --> 05:55.816
I want to thank you, John
for the job they put me on

05:55.849 --> 05:57.607
and who do you
work for, John

05:57.641 --> 05:59.367
a mighty man is he

05:59.400 --> 06:02.967
how do you like the dough
indeed-y I don't know

06:03.001 --> 06:04.775
but again the world go on

06:04.809 --> 06:08.967
so humanity's work
is done

06:09.000 --> 06:11.367
yeah!

06:14.408 --> 06:16.775
Excuse me a minute,
will ya?

06:17.367 --> 06:19.767
Welcome, Commander.
Oh, thank you.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.167
I'm Eddie Powers, Donovan's
factotum, meaning, "Man Friday."

06:22.775 --> 06:25.175
That's Latin. Well, I’m
glad to know you, Friday.

06:25.208 --> 06:28.167
Even if it's only Thursday. This is
Miss Chesley. The navy's "Blue Monday."

06:28.200 --> 06:31.767
Pleased to meet you. If you follow
me, you'll wallow in bubble water.

06:31.801 --> 06:33.575
Well, here's Mr. Donovan. Hello, hello.

06:33.608 --> 06:35.975
The navy and his lady. You hear our song?

06:36.009 --> 06:37.767
Not a sour note
in the whole gang.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.167
Nothing like it at the
metropolitan. I'll say.

06:40.201 --> 06:43.175
You seem to be a man
of many talents, Mr. Donovan.

06:43.208 --> 06:46.775
Don't be so susceptible, Connie.
I play a mean mouth organ myself.

06:46.809 --> 06:49.127
You do, sailor? We'll have
to play a duet sometime.

06:49.735 --> 06:52.135
You were saying this afternoon
that I could help you.

06:52.169 --> 06:53.927
That's right.
How?

06:53.960 --> 06:56.935
By coming with me to Washington,
representing the construction angle.

06:56.969 --> 06:59.335
Helping me sell my plan
to the navy.

06:59.368 --> 07:02.327
Sell the idea of arming construction
gangs? What is there to sell?

07:02.360 --> 07:04.727
Oh, nothing at all,
just an Admiral or two,

07:04.761 --> 07:07.127
and a few battleships
to be pushed around.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.935
There's more to it
than you think.

07:08.968 --> 07:11.927
Could you find me a thousand men-
cat-skinners, hoisters, drillers-

07:11.960 --> 07:14.327
every kind of specialist
in their proper proportion?

07:14.361 --> 07:16.135
You have 'em, sailor.
All we'll have to do-

07:16.169 --> 07:19.735
you do things easily, Mr. Donovan, by just a
- a wave of the hand.

07:19.769 --> 07:23.335
Who was it flung seeds on the earth,
and saw furrows of armed men...

07:23.368 --> 07:26.327
rise from them
between sunset and sunrise?

07:26.360 --> 07:28.727
Or vice-versa?
That was St. Patrick, ma'am.

07:28.761 --> 07:30.535
Eddie, will ya do me
a favor?

07:30.569 --> 07:32.935
Name it, boss,
and it's afait accompli,

07:32.968 --> 07:34.727
meanin' "in the bag"-
that's French.

07:34.761 --> 07:36.535
Take baby snooks out
and buy her a popsicle.

07:36.569 --> 07:40.727
Connie, it looks like
- I’m capable of recognizing a hint when I hear one.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.535
Shall we waltz,
Mr. Powers?

07:42.568 --> 07:45.527
I must be warnin' you, Miss.
I'm no terpsichorean.

07:48.535 --> 07:51.527
It's a relief to be out of
earshot of that important baboon.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.927
Don't let the boys
hear you, lady,

07:53.961 --> 07:57.527
or you'll go home in a state
of "ecdysical" embarrassment.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.335
I will?
You will.

07:59.369 --> 08:04.135
If I go home in a state of "ecdysical"
embarrassment, how will I go home?

08:04.169 --> 08:05.927
Wearin' nothin'
but your hat!

08:07.769 --> 08:10.135
Frankly,
I-I don't get it,

08:10.168 --> 08:12.535
his throwing a brawl
like this for his men,

08:12.569 --> 08:14.935
when they come home with
five dead and four crippled.

08:14.968 --> 08:19.127
That's Donovan's way of showing his
appreciation for the men who did a job.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.935
Oh.

08:20.968 --> 08:24.535
I suppose you'd like a
drink. That I would, ma'am.

08:27.527 --> 08:31.095
Shall we sit here? Please, that's
for the five who didn't come back.

08:34.039 --> 08:36.294
I see.

08:36.328 --> 08:39.255
How did you come to work for
Donovan, Eddie? He came to me.

08:39.847 --> 08:42.246
To you? I was the boss of
a sewer gang in Brooklyn.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.054
He braced me for a job.

08:44.089 --> 08:47.047
I should have chased him off, but
I gave him a muck shovel instead.

08:47.081 --> 08:50.055
He looked starved.
I'll never forget.

08:50.088 --> 08:52.455
He was only 14...
and skinny as a rail!

08:54.281 --> 08:56.647
But I’d still like
that drink, ma'am.

08:56.681 --> 08:59.047
Well, Eddie, suppose you go and
get yourself one? Oh, thank you.

09:08.535 --> 09:11.527
How are you doing? I haven't had
a real chance to talk to him yet.

09:11.560 --> 09:14.535
He has promised to come to
Washington. They'll listen to him.

09:14.569 --> 09:16.327
His reputation
in construction is tops.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.335
There's more than that to his
reputation. I looked in our files.

09:19.369 --> 09:21.735
So? Let me warn you that
your friend Donovan...

09:21.768 --> 09:25.335
is a hotheaded ape with
a hair-trigger temper.

09:25.369 --> 09:29.527
When he's nice, he's very, very nice,
and when he's not, he's stinkin'.

09:32.568 --> 09:34.935
Hello. Yeah?

09:34.969 --> 09:37.335
Wait a minute.
Hey, Wedge.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.935
Yeah? The manager of the
hotel wants to talk to ya.

09:40.968 --> 09:44.535
So it's you again.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:44.569 --> 09:46.327
You're the manager and
we're makin' too much noise.

09:46.360 --> 09:50.535
So what? I rented this suite
till 10:00 tomorrow morning.

09:50.568 --> 09:53.494
I don't want any more calls. Ain't
wantin' to get any more calls?

09:53.528 --> 09:55.287
No. Ain't gonna make any calls out?

09:55.320 --> 09:57.095
No!

10:01.895 --> 10:04.887
- [Drum roll, cymbal crash
- hey, Wedge.

10:04.920 --> 10:08.487
This is "Twinkles" Tucker. She
claims to be a champion jitterbug.

10:08.521 --> 10:11.495
But she says she'll no dance
with anyone but the boss.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.287
Come on, Wedge. Get in
there. Oh, come on, Wedge.

10:37.895 --> 10:39.687
What do I do now?
Pull.

10:57.095 --> 10:58.887
Whoa!

11:13.287 --> 11:16.887
Hey, jitterbug!
Attaboy, Wedge.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.695
I like your finish.
Yeah, "finish" is right.

11:31.287 --> 11:34.294
So don't forget,
tomorrow in Washington, 11:00.

11:34.328 --> 11:37.847
Captain Joyce's office. I'll
be there, right on the pin.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.247
Say, uh, what do you two
do for an encore?

11:40.281 --> 11:42.055
Oh.

12:03.975 --> 12:05.767
Right on the pin. Ready to go? All set.

12:05.801 --> 12:08.167
What are you doing here?
Waiting to join you two...

12:08.200 --> 12:09.974
in a little celebration
at lunch time, I hope.

12:10.008 --> 12:11.767
It's in the bag.
You can order the wine.

12:11.801 --> 12:14.166
Captain Joyce will see you now.
Oh, thank you.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.975
Don't you wish
you could come inside?

12:16.009 --> 12:17.767
Might make
a front-page story.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.167
- Want me to fix it up for ya?
- Don't bother.

12:20.201 --> 12:23.766
I'll know more about it
in 24 hours than you will.

12:25.575 --> 12:27.975
It's nice to see you, bob. Thank you, sir.

12:28.008 --> 12:30.375
This is Mr. Donovan. Captain
Joyce. Good morning, Mr. Donovan.

12:30.409 --> 12:32.775
Good morning. Your name is a
familiar one to this bureau.

12:32.808 --> 12:34.567
Sit down, won't you, please? Thank you.

12:34.601 --> 12:37.575
Commander Yarrow wanted you on hand
when he discussed some matter with me.

12:38.166 --> 12:41.735
Mr. Donovan had a construction job on the
island when the Japanese attacked, sir.

12:41.769 --> 12:44.647
Most of his crew were killed. Yes, I know.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.655
If these men had been in uniform,
they might still be alive.

12:47.689 --> 12:50.055
They would be alive.

12:50.088 --> 12:52.455
And I submit, sir-
no, thank you-

12:52.489 --> 12:54.807
that every day this war
makes more and more demands...

12:54.840 --> 12:57.206
for construction
under combat conditions-

12:57.240 --> 12:59.607
airfields, roads,
beachhead installations.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.006
The navy has been impressed by
that fact ever since pearl harbor.

13:02.614 --> 13:05.015
We've been giving it
consideration in principle.

13:05.048 --> 13:06.806
You have a definite
suggestion to offer?

13:07.414 --> 13:09.815
I'd like to suggest the
raising of a model basic unit,

13:10.406 --> 13:13.975
large enough to include the specialists
and machinery to do any kind of a job.

13:14.009 --> 13:18.647
Say 1,000 men, sir-
self-contained, self-sufficient.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.454
A battalion. A construction
battalion. Right.

13:21.047 --> 13:24.646
And I can get you the men bulldozers,
blasters, drillers, cat-skinners.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.047
Any men you want,
and the best in the country.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.054
That would be a model basic
unit indeed, Mr. Donovan.

13:30.088 --> 13:33.047
I'll take it up with the Admiral. In the
meantime, you're attached to my office.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.447
I want you to prepare
a complete, detailed report.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.815
Concentrate first on a
training program. Yes, sir.

13:37.848 --> 13:41.415
Why waste time? What training
do they need? Training to fight.

13:41.449 --> 13:45.607
Training to fight? You might as
well start training them to drink.

13:45.641 --> 13:48.615
I'm offering you construction
crews, not white-collar ads.

13:48.648 --> 13:50.935
They know
what it is to fight.

13:50.968 --> 13:53.671
Every rock tunnel they drill
costs a man a mile.

13:53.704 --> 13:55.974
And every steel span
they bridge costs another.

13:56.008 --> 13:58.375
They know that when they take
the jobs. But, Mr. Donovan-

13:58.408 --> 14:01.975
all they want is something in
their hands when the trouble starts.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.767
That's not
the navy's opinion, sir.

14:03.800 --> 14:08.454
We send no man into action until he has been
disciplined and taught to use his weapon.

14:08.488 --> 14:12.646
That'll take months. It may take
three months, it may take 12 months.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.455
That doesn't make
any difference.

14:14.489 --> 14:16.727
If we send out
one untrained man,

14:16.761 --> 14:20.807
some mother may pay for our
impatience with the life of a son.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.206
I've got three contracts
in the pacific,

14:23.240 --> 14:26.215
and my men mean as much to me
as yours do to the navy.

14:26.248 --> 14:29.734
What are they, expendable?
I want 'em armed.

14:29.768 --> 14:32.727
The arming of civilians is prohibited
by an international convention,

14:32.760 --> 14:34.534
not by
the united states navy.

14:34.568 --> 14:38.695
There is nothing you or I can
do about that. Isn't there?

14:38.728 --> 14:42.295
I have a contract here for
an airfield on island x-214.

14:42.329 --> 14:45.207
I'm going there personally
and take my best crew.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.366
And if Tojo and his bug-eyed
monkeys get in our way,

14:47.927 --> 14:50.246
you may find out you have
a construction unit...

14:50.280 --> 14:52.614
and a combat unit
rolled into one!

14:52.648 --> 14:56.167
Wait, Wedge. For how long?
Three months, 12 months?

14:56.200 --> 14:59.015
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I'm not built for waiting.

14:59.048 --> 15:01.366
You learn that in the navy, not
in the construction business.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.375
What happened?

15:04.408 --> 15:07.974
You'll know more about it in 24
hours than I do, Miss Chesley.

15:26.055 --> 15:30.247
Hey, Collins. Where abouts
is Flatbush from here?

15:30.281 --> 15:33.255
That's it over there, and you
better take a good look at it,

15:33.288 --> 15:36.855
because the Dodgers'll win the world
series before you ever see it again.

15:36.888 --> 15:40.406
This job's supposed to take
30 days, not 30 years, Collins.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.415
Oh. Got a cigarette? Yeah.

15:44.006 --> 15:47.607
So long, new York. We won't see a good-lookin'
pair of legs until we see you again.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.006
Oh, I wouldn't
say that, speck.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.407
If it isn't inter-ocean's
special ace! How are you, Connie?

15:53.015 --> 15:55.414
Fine, you old son of a gun.
Hello, fellows.

15:55.448 --> 15:57.815
Say, this is great! How
do you do, Mr. Donovan?

15:57.848 --> 16:00.214
Well, what are you
doing aboard?

16:00.248 --> 16:02.615
Same thing as these alleged
gentlemen of the press.

16:02.648 --> 16:05.014
Oh, by the way, the Captain
wants to see you. What for?

16:05.607 --> 16:08.614
So he can throw your junk out of the
bridge deck cabin and put mine in.

16:08.648 --> 16:12.215
Are you gonna be a nuisance on
this trip? No more than usual.

16:12.248 --> 16:14.006
Sure you're not running out
on your boyfriend?

16:14.040 --> 16:15.815
You'll know more
about that in 24 days.

16:16.407 --> 16:20.007
Twenty-four days? How come? They flew
bob out to island x-214 last Wednesday,

16:20.615 --> 16:22.406
as officer in charge
of construction.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.415
Now, if you don't mind, I’d
like to get settled in your-

16:26.007 --> 16:27.814
I mean my cabin.

16:29.607 --> 16:33.206
So, teacher's pet is on her
way to Australia for news too.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.015
Uh-huh, on 30 minutes'
notice, sweetheart.

16:35.048 --> 16:38.006
Anybody got an extra pair of nylons
in their pocket? That ought to be easy.

16:38.614 --> 16:41.015
I always carry
- excuse me, I think I observe an acquaintance.

16:41.048 --> 16:43.414
You're a fine bundle
of mollycoddles.

16:43.448 --> 16:45.815
I give you a little party
last night, and now look at ya.

16:45.848 --> 16:47.606
Why don't you be men,
like I am?

16:48.214 --> 16:50.614
Hey, Novasky, a glass
of ice-water, quick.

16:50.648 --> 16:54.807
I think I had too much fish last
night. Was that what you was drinkin'?

16:54.840 --> 16:57.814
Looks like we're shipmates,
old sesquipedalian.

16:57.848 --> 16:59.607
"Sesquipe-who-lian"?
"Pedalian."

16:59.640 --> 17:02.006
Oh, sesquipedalian, is it? Uh-huh.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.015
Eddie, is that good? I
wouldn't know, Novasky.

17:05.048 --> 17:08.615
I never run across that canary in all
the crossword puzzles I’ve seen so far.

17:08.647 --> 17:11.606
That means, "a user of
big words." we're even.

17:51.174 --> 17:53.575
Beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, it's you.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.175
Yes, it's pretty.

17:57.766 --> 17:59.574
Watching a ship's wake
always makes me think...

17:59.608 --> 18:02.327
of the things that time
puts behind us forever:

18:02.360 --> 18:05.655
Hopes, dreams, illusions.

18:05.688 --> 18:07.894
What does it make you
think about?

18:08.487 --> 18:12.054
If they changed the pitch of that
propeller, we'd get a couple of more knots.

18:12.088 --> 18:16.246
I thought I’d caught you
being human for once.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.207
Don't you have anything under
that thick hide of yours...

18:19.240 --> 18:21.015
except cylinders
and a carburetor?

18:21.048 --> 18:23.414
Spark plug, maybe.

18:24.615 --> 18:28.214
The last time I saw a night
like this, I was in Hawaii.

18:28.248 --> 18:31.206
Ever been to Hawaii? Europe? No.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.935
Why not?

18:33.526 --> 18:36.535
Never had the time. Why
didn't you make the time?

18:36.568 --> 18:39.526
Oh, for the same reason.

18:41.335 --> 18:43.655
Do I bore you,
Mr. Donovan?

18:43.688 --> 18:46.054
No, no.
Keep talking.

18:46.088 --> 18:47.847
I will
if you listen to me.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.206
I'll listen to anything you
have to say. That makes it easy.

18:51.240 --> 18:56.006
Why don't you help bob put across his
ideas for the construction battalions?

18:56.040 --> 18:57.814
Oh, I tried-
you tried.

18:57.848 --> 19:01.814
If you hadn't been such a hotheaded ape,
he'd be working on it in Washington now.

19:01.848 --> 19:05.414
What do you mean, now? I mean,
he was sent on this mission...

19:05.448 --> 19:08.406
to keep you
from hunting trouble.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.214
To play nursemaid
to me, huh?

19:10.248 --> 19:14.086
Don't be so contemptibly
self-centered. There's a war on.

19:14.119 --> 19:17.094
What bob wants is important, and
you're the only man who can help him.

19:17.128 --> 19:21.670
How? Work out the details
for a model unit with him.

19:21.704 --> 19:23.446
Then fly back with him
from the island.

19:23.480 --> 19:28.502
Powers can take over your job. Your
going on it was only a gesture anyway.

19:28.536 --> 19:31.414
The navy will have to listen
to you when you talk its way.

19:31.447 --> 19:35.543
They respect you for what you
are, for what you've accomplished.

19:35.576 --> 19:37.846
And if it's any added
inducement, Wedge, so do I-

19:45.014 --> 19:46.807
I’m sorry I did that.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.206
For a minute,
you made me forget.

19:49.239 --> 19:52.775
Forget? That you're bob Yarrow's girl.

20:11.848 --> 20:14.807
This is beautiful, ain't
it? Yeah, but it's hot.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.814
Oh, we'll have a swell
time here. Yeah, a hot time.

20:17.848 --> 20:21.414
Just like the movies,
eh, Novasky?

20:21.448 --> 20:23.206
Yeah, just like
the movies.

20:23.239 --> 20:26.806
Soon, me and Natasha will be
right under them palm trees.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.815
Soon, you and Natasha will be
knocking down them palm trees.

20:29.848 --> 20:34.007
Oh, sure enough. Wait, you
blow 'em up! That's right.

20:40.566 --> 20:43.574
How do you do, gentlemen? I'm glad
to see you. How are you, Captain?

20:43.608 --> 20:45.974
I'm Lieutenant Kerrick, commanding
the navy detachment on the island.

20:46.008 --> 20:48.374
This is Lieutenant Commander Yarrow,
the officer in charge of construction.

20:48.967 --> 20:50.775
How do you do, sir?
How do you do?

20:50.808 --> 20:53.174
We have some friends of yours
on board, sir. Hello, bob!

20:53.208 --> 20:56.166
Connie! What in the
world are you doing here?

20:56.200 --> 20:57.974
I'm on my way to Australia
for inter-ocean.

20:58.008 --> 21:01.574
"A woman's viewpoint on the war down
under by our special correspondent."

21:01.608 --> 21:05.174
By my special correspondent. Come on, I want you
- oh, sorry, Kerrick.

21:05.208 --> 21:07.574
Lieutenant, this is Miss
Chesley. How do you do?

21:07.607 --> 21:10.566
How do you do? Come on, let's go ashore.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.575
Eddie! Powers!

21:13.608 --> 21:15.366
Get 'em ashore.
Step on it.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.966
Okay, Wedge. All right, men,
hit the deck. We're goin' ashore.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.567
Showin' him a job is like showin'
Sawyer Collins a bottle of rye!

21:22.600 --> 21:26.166
A bottle? Who has it? Come on,
come on. We'll find a jug on shore.

21:26.199 --> 21:27.975
Come on, now, get out of here. Wait for me!

21:38.166 --> 21:41.767
It's lovely here, bob.
How far is it to the barracks?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.166
Along the beach a little
ways, and off to your right.

21:44.200 --> 21:48.374
Nice seeing you again, Yarrow.
I hope it'll be nice, Wedge.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.166
It will be if you
leave me alone.

21:50.199 --> 21:52.566
I'm just here
to do a job.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.374
The navy way.

21:54.966 --> 21:57.366
Then how about telling me
where my men are to stay?

21:57.400 --> 21:59.766
Oh, that's
Lieutenant Kerrick's end.

21:59.799 --> 22:02.774
Will you talk to Mr. Donovan
about where to billet his men?

22:02.808 --> 22:04.566
We'll make room for 'em
in the barracks.

22:04.599 --> 22:06.375
I don't want 'em
in the barracks.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.774
They're not used
to regulations.

22:08.808 --> 22:12.966
In the islands, Mr. Donovan, it's not
always what one wants. It is with me.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.174
Are you comfortable here, bob?
Sleeping under a palm tree isn't so bad.

22:17.208 --> 22:18.966
But you'll find out tonight. I will?

22:18.999 --> 22:21.974
Yes, you're staying ashore.
But don't worry about anything.

22:22.008 --> 22:25.575
We've rented a porcupine to
chaperone you. I can't believe it!

22:25.608 --> 22:27.974
It's like
a little paradise.

22:28.008 --> 22:30.375
Complete, even to the serpents. Serpents?

22:30.408 --> 22:35.175
But these aren't on the ground. They have
wings, and call themselves mosquitoes.

22:35.208 --> 22:38.166
These are copra sheds,
aren't they? Uh-huh.

22:38.199 --> 22:39.974
Using 'em?
No.

22:40.008 --> 22:42.374
I'll have them cleaned out
and fumigated for my men.

22:42.408 --> 22:46.566
I'd advise against it. I know
what's best for my men, Lieutenant.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.166
How are you, folks? Hey,
some friends of yours?

22:50.200 --> 22:53.767
Preposterous. Never saw the
people before in my life.

22:54.966 --> 22:56.774
No glamour.
Too plump.

22:56.808 --> 22:59.766
They'll all look thin enough
after you're here a month.

22:59.800 --> 23:03.366
Hello there.

23:03.400 --> 23:07.574
You know, bob, I think it'll improve
the north end if we dig a little deeper.

23:07.607 --> 23:10.534
Sounds like a good idea, Tom.
We'll need bedding and dishes.

23:10.568 --> 23:13.494
We'll take care of our own food, but
you've got to take care of our water supply.

23:13.528 --> 23:15.286
I've already made provision for that. Good.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.686
Now, where's the site
for our airfield?

23:17.719 --> 23:20.086
Come on over here. I'll
show it to you on a model.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.686
Only 30 days to complete this
job. We better start as of now.

23:23.719 --> 23:25.494
You see,
here's the station.

23:25.528 --> 23:29.094
And over here's the quarry where you'll
be supplied with your servicing materials.

23:29.127 --> 23:32.086
Now, this brush section
is the site of the airfield.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.486
We'll start first with
the east-west landing strip.

23:35.094 --> 23:37.494
Start east-west?

23:37.528 --> 23:39.254
That'll add a week on
to the job.

23:39.287 --> 23:42.246
We want a place for planes
to land as soon as possible.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.814
I don't see any difference
- but then, I’m no sailor.

23:45.847 --> 23:48.214
Maybe I can show you
the difference.

23:48.248 --> 23:51.206
This wind rose shows
that for the next 60 days,

23:51.240 --> 23:53.606
the prevailing winds will blow
from an easterly direction.

23:54.214 --> 23:57.206
And since an airplane has to
land into the wind, or crack up-

23:57.240 --> 23:59.606
we'll start with the
east-west strip. Right.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.414
It's first things first
in the navy, Mr. Donovan.

24:01.448 --> 24:05.014
First of all is the
military consideration. Okay.

24:05.047 --> 24:08.006
You make with the pencils,
and we'll make with the shovels.

24:15.688 --> 24:19.254
Have you ever tried to make a
story jell when it didn't want to?

24:19.288 --> 24:22.246
Not since I was a plebe before
the commandant at Annapolis.

24:22.279 --> 24:25.846
This is awful. The home office will
take one look and put me on ice.

24:26.454 --> 24:28.854
You better come up with something
good before the next boat sails,

24:28.888 --> 24:30.646
or you'll be in the soup
for staying over.

24:31.254 --> 24:34.246
Oh, well, maybe Wedge Donovan
will dig up a buried city,

24:34.280 --> 24:37.254
or get himself
captured by cannibals.

24:37.287 --> 24:39.046
Maybe he will.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.446
Speaking of that big ape,
have you seen him around today?

24:42.054 --> 24:44.454
I'm on my way to see the "big
ape" right now. Want to come along?

24:45.046 --> 24:48.006
I certainly do.
Where is he?

24:48.040 --> 24:49.814
Much too close,
I’m afraid.

24:50.406 --> 24:53.414
As a matter of fact, he's
standing between us right now.

24:53.448 --> 24:57.014
I suppose I should pretend I
don't know what you mean by that.

24:57.047 --> 24:58.806
But I won't.
Am I wrong?

24:59.414 --> 25:03.606
Yeah, you're wrong. Look, for the
past few days, all you've done is-

25:03.640 --> 25:07.206
all I’ve done is what? To tell
a man in a thousand little ways-

25:07.240 --> 25:11.414
to tell what man in a thousand little
ways? Not with words, but with looks.

25:11.447 --> 25:13.814
Actions, and-
aren't you ashamed?

25:13.848 --> 25:16.214
All right. Maybe, as you say, I’m wrong.

25:43.814 --> 25:46.214
This is the last one,
Yump!

25:49.814 --> 25:51.606
It's enough.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.614
Come on, Brick.
Let's get out of here.

25:54.647 --> 25:57.606
I'll be all right here.
I'd rather you came with me.

26:01.814 --> 26:03.606
Okay, Johnny.
I'll check on that one.

26:04.214 --> 26:06.614
You know, Wedge, I could
shoot these dynamite sticks...

26:06.648 --> 26:08.406
just as good as Yump.

26:08.439 --> 26:10.214
Why don't you give me
a chance blasting?

26:10.806 --> 26:12.614
Ever made a mistake?
Never.

26:12.647 --> 26:15.014
That lets you out.

26:15.048 --> 26:19.206
To be a good blaster, you've got to
have made a mistake and still be alive.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.606
Why do they say
Yump's the best?

26:22.214 --> 26:24.006
'Cause he's the oldest.

26:27.606 --> 26:30.614
Fire!
Fire in the hole!

26:50.854 --> 26:54.454
There she goes! Get that stuff
ground up as quick as you can.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.854
I'll be down at the north end. Right, boss.

26:56.887 --> 27:01.045
Get back to work, Brick. Swede, I
know I can blast just as good as Yump.

27:01.653 --> 27:04.646
Get outta here. Some day
I’m gonna blow you up.

27:16.405 --> 27:18.134
Mr. Collins!

27:18.167 --> 27:20.534
Hah?
Oh, there you are.

27:20.568 --> 27:22.326
That was a bonnie wee tune
I was singin'.

27:22.934 --> 27:24.726
I must get it
in my own key someday.

27:25.334 --> 27:27.125
Could you tell us
- would you, uh, care for a cigarette?

27:27.159 --> 27:30.646
Like one. Oh, it's silly the
way they pack these things.

27:30.680 --> 27:34.245
You can't get at them. Would
you excuse me just a moment?

27:34.279 --> 27:36.054
Uh-huh.

27:45.654 --> 27:49.253
Here we are. Now, if you
would do me the honor-

27:49.287 --> 27:51.046
hadn't you better count
your fingers, Sawyer?

27:51.079 --> 27:54.646
Oh, it always turns out the
same. Ten or 12, roughly.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.454
Where's
Mr. Donovan?

27:57.046 --> 27:58.854
Sawyer.
Aye, aye, sir.

27:58.887 --> 28:00.646
I want eight
twelve-by-twelves, ten feet.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.045
Don't give me ten
eight-by-eights, twelve feet.

28:03.079 --> 28:05.446
And I want 'em without
hemstitchin'. What? No tattin'?

28:05.479 --> 28:08.453
Go on. You'd be lookin'
for Wedge, I suppose, Miss?

28:08.487 --> 28:11.446
That's right. You'll find him by
the quarry, or on the north end.

28:11.479 --> 28:13.846
Aren't you afraid he'll stumble
into that saw someday?

28:13.880 --> 28:16.854
If he does, I’ll kick his teeth in.
It's the only rip blade we've got left.

28:16.887 --> 28:18.646
Why don't you make him
cut down on his drinking?

28:18.680 --> 28:21.046
Would you want a man to work
in an unnatural condition?

28:21.079 --> 28:23.446
But how can
- bob! Yeah?

28:24.054 --> 28:25.846
May I speak with you alone,
please? Oh, sure, Tom.

28:25.879 --> 28:28.246
Excuse me, Connie.
Sure.

28:28.280 --> 28:31.845
I have a job to do, Miss. You'll
have to excuse me, too. Right.

28:35.446 --> 28:37.846
Dispatch report just came in
from naval headquarters.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.246
Big task force
is forming up north.

28:40.279 --> 28:43.846
We've been ordered on the alert till
we learn what the Japs are up to.

28:43.879 --> 28:45.654
Thought you'd like to
know, Commander. Yeah.

28:45.687 --> 28:48.646
Any chance of them coming
this way? Who knows?

28:48.679 --> 28:51.653
Harbor entrance protected?
Yes, we mined that.

28:51.687 --> 28:54.646
But there's another entrance
at the far end that's wide open.

28:54.679 --> 28:57.654
The mine layer that was bringing
the mines was torpedoed, and-

28:58.246 --> 29:00.645
I didn't think you'd want
the civilians to know. No, no.

29:00.679 --> 29:03.046
I guess it's better
that they don't know.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.445
Thanks, Tom.

29:06.646 --> 29:09.654
What's the secret? Are you
going to tell me this time?

29:09.687 --> 29:12.054
Oh, no. This one
I keep all for myself.

29:14.454 --> 29:16.246
Hello, Charlie.
Hi, Wedge.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.645
Hey, they're doin' all right. Yep.

29:18.679 --> 29:21.654
They check with you about
section three yet? Yes.

29:21.688 --> 29:25.253
Yump'll have that gravel up here
for you pretty soon. We can use it.

29:25.287 --> 29:27.046
Hello.
Hi.

29:27.079 --> 29:29.445
Yarrow, I’m ready for those
changes in the blueprints.

29:29.479 --> 29:33.046
You mean, you'll be ready for them
in the morning. We're ready tonight.

29:33.079 --> 29:36.054
I'll put a gang to work and have
the foundations laid by midnight.

29:36.088 --> 29:39.653
What are you going to use for light?
Electricians are rigging floods.

29:39.687 --> 29:42.645
I'm sorry. Blackout regulations.
All work stops at sunset.

29:42.679 --> 29:46.854
If you'll give us light, we can bring
this job in under the deadline after all.

29:46.887 --> 29:51.046
Sorry, Wedge, no light. And speaking of
foundations, where are your daily reports?

29:51.079 --> 29:54.646
These specifications call for
1-2-3 mix. It's been two days now-

29:54.680 --> 29:58.853
gonna be difficult, huh? I won't
stand for halfway measures, Wedge.

29:58.887 --> 30:00.646
Or did you learn that
in Washington?

30:00.679 --> 30:04.246
You've been tying up my production
schedule since we hit this island.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.645
I want your reports. They've
got to know what you're doing.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.453
How will they know
from the reports?

30:08.487 --> 30:11.446
When the job's finished, there'll be no
more sand, no more gravel, no more cement.

30:11.479 --> 30:14.454
Yeah, but there will be
a report to that effect.

30:14.488 --> 30:16.854
All right, Commander.

30:16.887 --> 30:19.846
The reports'll be
on your desk in the morning.

30:22.853 --> 30:28.246
You know, he almost makes
me dislike him. Almost?

30:49.446 --> 30:52.454
Mm.

30:52.488 --> 30:54.246
How does it go?

31:21.765 --> 31:24.166
Can you cook, too?
Uh-huh.

31:24.199 --> 31:26.565
Corned beef and cabbage
for dinner tonight.

31:27.173 --> 31:28.966
Stop kidding.
Oh, I’m not kidding.

31:28.999 --> 31:31.365
You really whipped up
corned beef and cabbage?

31:31.399 --> 31:33.174
Uh-huh.
Just for me?

31:33.208 --> 31:35.573
Oh, don't be coy.
I like it too.

31:35.607 --> 31:39.126
Do you, uh,
smoke a pipe too?

31:39.159 --> 31:40.933
Do you think
I’d enjoy it?

31:40.967 --> 31:43.254
What's it gonna get you,
Connie?

31:43.287 --> 31:48.037
Filling my pipe pouring my
drinks, corned beef and cabbage.

31:48.071 --> 31:52.374
You've got Eddie Powers and the rest laughing
at those cute little lunches you bring.

31:52.966 --> 31:56.566
Very well, if you don't want me
to bring you lunch to the job,

31:56.599 --> 31:58.374
I won't bring you
lunch to the job.

31:58.407 --> 32:03.174
Thanks. And I don't want my slippers
waiting for me every night, either.

32:03.207 --> 32:06.166
And no flower for your
buttonhole in the morning?

32:06.774 --> 32:09.173
Oh, Wedge, you're mean.

32:10.373 --> 32:13.925
Connie, this is strictly
from Brooklyn, but...

32:13.959 --> 32:16.326
why don't you dance with
the guy that brung ya?

32:16.360 --> 32:19.925
Don't ever kid yourself
that I’m not. Why the act?

32:19.959 --> 32:23.525
Because innately, you're
a gentleman. Thank you.

32:23.559 --> 32:27.126
Not that anyone would suspect it
from the way you've been acting.

32:27.159 --> 32:30.133
No? No. But because I
know you're a gentleman, I-

32:30.167 --> 32:33.125
thank you again. I know
that sooner or later,

32:33.159 --> 32:36.053
kindness and consideration
is going to wear you down.

32:36.087 --> 32:40.805
Eventually, you might even agree that
bob's idea for a navy construction unit...

32:40.839 --> 32:43.765
is so much bigger
than Wedge Donovan...

32:43.799 --> 32:46.773
that you'll agree
to become part of it.

32:46.807 --> 32:49.173
That's why
I’m being nice to you.

32:49.207 --> 32:51.509
And believe me,
for no other reason.

32:51.543 --> 32:54.933
I'll bet you make the best corned
beef and cabbage in the world.

32:54.967 --> 32:57.333
Beautiful eyes, too.

32:59.125 --> 33:03.333
Oh, about those sandwiches
- if they're gonna have corned beef in 'em tomorrow,

33:03.367 --> 33:05.126
you better make a couple
extra for Eddie Powers.

33:05.159 --> 33:08.133
And don't forget
the rest of the boys.

33:21.525 --> 33:25.125
Go out to the south end and clear
those trees out. Come here, bill.

33:25.159 --> 33:26.933
Go over and get those bushes
out of there, right away.

33:35.925 --> 33:40.086
You're slowing to a walk. I expected you
to have that third section finished today.

33:40.694 --> 33:44.853
For your information, my fine feathered
friend, I’m six days ahead of schedule!

33:44.886 --> 33:49.045
If it weren't for butterfly rum,
you'd be eight days ahead!

33:57.445 --> 33:59.253
Butterfly rum, is it?

33:59.287 --> 34:02.853
If you're gonna finish this job, you
better tell them to cut out that music.

34:02.887 --> 34:06.453
Practice alarms. All right,
get 'em down to the quarry.

34:06.487 --> 34:10.054
All right, come in, men, all
of you. Come on in. Hurry it up.

34:10.087 --> 34:13.045
Here, come on, lads.
Come on, get in the quarry.

34:13.078 --> 34:16.053
Come on, you back there.
Come on.

34:16.087 --> 34:18.453
Take it out!

34:26.853 --> 34:28.646
Get goin', men.
Get goin'.

34:28.679 --> 34:31.045
Hurry up, men. Hurry up. Hurry up, men.

34:43.079 --> 34:44.853
Come on, let's move!

34:47.253 --> 34:49.045
All right, come on you men. Get going.

34:51.445 --> 34:53.844
Step lively.

34:54.453 --> 34:56.245
Bring those trucks in.

35:01.045 --> 35:03.445
Thompson!

35:25.045 --> 35:27.446
Murphy! Don't you ever get
tired of playing this game?

35:28.053 --> 35:29.845
Post seven reports
enemy sighted, sir.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.654
Surface craft.
Very well.

35:35.253 --> 35:38.853
This must be the real McCoy. It is.

35:38.887 --> 35:41.254
What can I do? Well, I’ll
explain the situation to you,

35:41.845 --> 35:43.653
so as things develop
you'll know what's going on.

35:43.687 --> 35:46.645
Lieutenant Kerrick has left me in
charge while he's withdrawn his force,

35:46.679 --> 35:49.045
until he knows where
the main attack is coming from.

35:50.854 --> 35:52.645
Enemy sighted, sir.
Two destroyers.

35:52.678 --> 35:55.654
Bearing 2-7-0 degrees.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.645
Very well.
Bronson.

35:59.253 --> 36:01.653
Relay that message to Lieutenant
Kerrick. Aye, aye, sir.

36:01.687 --> 36:04.053
- We'll be shovin' off now, Murphy.
- Aye, aye, sir.

36:04.086 --> 36:06.453
All right, let's go.
We're moving back.

36:06.487 --> 36:09.446
Donovan, get going. And take
it easy up that dirt road.

36:09.479 --> 36:12.453
Enemy gunners don't ask for a better
target than the dust cloud from a truck.

36:12.487 --> 36:16.053
Okay, we'll stay put, as long as
the navy keeps the Japs off us.

36:16.087 --> 36:19.654
You'll stay put as long as the
navy tells you to. That's an order.

36:19.687 --> 36:21.445
That's one way
to win an argument.

36:25.045 --> 36:26.853
Connie!

36:27.445 --> 36:29.845
We have most of the women and
children down at the bomb shelter.

36:29.879 --> 36:32.245
Donovan!

36:32.278 --> 36:35.253
Take her with you!

36:35.287 --> 36:39.445
McClory! Load up on those trucks, men!

36:39.479 --> 36:41.845
Bring those trucks in!
Get aboard there, men.

36:42.453 --> 36:44.245
Come on,
let's get outta here.

37:00.453 --> 37:04.645
According to specifications,
score one for the navy.

37:13.045 --> 37:14.853
Get inside.

37:17.253 --> 37:19.045
Stay back,
away from the entrance.

37:19.079 --> 37:20.853
What's goin' on, Wedge? We got visitors.

37:21.446 --> 37:23.845
The Japs figure on taking over
the island. They're comin' ashore?

37:23.879 --> 37:25.653
Right. We took some of this before, Wedge.

37:26.246 --> 37:28.053
And we ain't sittin' it out
again. You bet your life we ain't.

37:28.087 --> 37:29.845
They're not knockin' us off
like Ryan and Olson.

37:29.878 --> 37:32.245
And Evans, and Buttons.
And Long Louie.

37:32.853 --> 37:35.253
How far is it from here to
where these "Japanesers" will be?

37:35.286 --> 37:38.245
They might be a stubborn
race, but they come apart easy.

37:38.279 --> 37:40.645
Kerrick and his sailors are
waiting for them at the airfield.

37:40.679 --> 37:43.045
Then what are we waiting for? Come on!

37:43.078 --> 37:46.645
All right, gents! This war is reserved
for the boys in the little white hats.

37:47.253 --> 37:49.653
We're to stay here where
we're safe. Navy orders.

37:49.686 --> 37:52.645
Oh, the navy.

38:08.245 --> 38:10.645
You got him, Wedge? Yeah.

38:12.453 --> 38:15.445
I know some first aid, Wedge.
Maybe I can help him.

38:19.045 --> 38:22.645
Can't help him.

38:22.678 --> 38:25.045
Take care of him.

38:28.645 --> 38:30.453
Eddie?
Right here, Wedge.

38:31.045 --> 38:34.053
Where'd you stash those guns? In
the covered truck, next to the crane.

38:34.087 --> 38:35.845
Look out.

38:36.453 --> 38:38.854
Run to your right, Wedge.

38:46.053 --> 38:48.454
Here you are, boys.
Help yourselves.

39:41.205 --> 39:44.213
Range 1-5, double-oh.

40:02.805 --> 40:05.813
Range, 1,000 yards.

40:11.205 --> 40:14.213
They're walking right into it.
Shall we let 'em have it?

40:14.246 --> 40:16.613
Why don't you wait a
couple minutes longer, Tom?

40:16.647 --> 40:19.013
Let 'em get their necks
really stuck out.

40:39.365 --> 40:44.165
The crazy fools.
Now we'll have to attack.

40:44.199 --> 40:45.973
Fix bayonets.

41:47.125 --> 41:48.933
Take to cover!

42:01.524 --> 42:03.925
Take to cover.
Get in the underbrush.

42:08.133 --> 42:09.925
Take to cover.

43:42.805 --> 43:46.405
For the first time in my life,
I’m sorry I’m in a uniform.

43:47.013 --> 43:50.613
What did you want us to do? Stay
and get picked off like clay pigeons?

43:50.646 --> 43:54.804
We had 'em cold. No human could have
lived in that cross fire for five seconds.

43:54.838 --> 43:57.205
You mashed it by bringing
your civilians in here.

43:57.239 --> 43:59.013
We couldn't fire
without killing you.

43:59.604 --> 44:02.005
All right, go on. Look
around. See what you've done.

44:02.038 --> 44:05.605
Every civilian here was wounded or killed
because a fool wouldn't obey orders.

45:18.805 --> 45:22.405
Wedge. Wedge!

45:29.604 --> 45:31.412
Find a doctor!
Yes, the doctor.

45:48.213 --> 45:51.205
Oh, Connie, why didn't you
stay in the bomb shelter?

45:51.239 --> 45:54.212
I was running to f
- anything I can do, sir?

45:56.005 --> 45:58.405
She does look
pretty bad, sir.

45:58.438 --> 46:00.212
Get out of here.

46:03.812 --> 46:06.213
Do I?

46:06.247 --> 46:08.612
Do I look bad, Wedge?

46:08.646 --> 46:12.213
Yeah, your lipstick's
on crooked.

46:15.205 --> 46:17.604
Wedge, I’m frightened, I-

46:17.638 --> 46:20.613
I don't want to die.
Oh, cut it out, crybaby.

46:22.405 --> 46:26.005
Wedge, hold on to me!

46:26.038 --> 46:28.373
I can't see you.

46:28.406 --> 46:30.165
It's your hair.

46:32.533 --> 46:35.525
Don't run out
on me now, Connie.

46:35.559 --> 46:37.925
Who'd get me
my slippers?

46:39.685 --> 46:42.645
Or fill your pipes.

46:42.679 --> 46:45.604
Or put a flower
in my buttonhole?

46:47.364 --> 46:51.525
Or cook-
corned beef and cabbage.

46:53.958 --> 46:56.933
I loved it.

46:56.966 --> 46:58.724
You called it an act.

46:58.758 --> 47:01.733
Oh, that was
double-talk.

47:04.084 --> 47:08.885
I'll trade you...
for plain English.

47:10.085 --> 47:12.453
Shoot.

47:12.486 --> 47:14.244
I love you.

47:18.453 --> 47:20.804
Well, wh-what am I...

47:20.838 --> 47:23.765
supposed to say?

47:24.885 --> 47:28.452
Only-
only what you feel.

47:30.212 --> 47:32.005
I love you.

47:35.558 --> 47:37.925
Connie?
Connie?

47:37.958 --> 47:39.733
Connie, I love you.

47:39.766 --> 47:43.333
Did you hear what I said?
I love you!

47:43.366 --> 47:45.732
Doctor!

47:45.766 --> 47:48.133
Please hurry.

47:55.253 --> 47:57.652
Step outside, please.

48:15.013 --> 48:16.805
A little rough.

48:16.838 --> 48:19.205
Yeah.

48:20.405 --> 48:23.412
You did a lot of talking
in there, Wedge.

48:24.005 --> 48:27.604
I'd have done the same thing
for anyone in that condition.

48:27.638 --> 48:30.005
What difference
does it make?

48:30.038 --> 48:31.812
She might live.

48:41.413 --> 48:43.205
Stretcher!

48:51.012 --> 48:52.805
How is she?
She's resting easily.

48:53.413 --> 48:55.204
She has
a 50-50 chance.

49:41.364 --> 49:44.373
Hey, chico.
Chico, please.

49:44.406 --> 49:46.164
Hey, chico.

49:46.198 --> 49:47.973
My leg.

49:48.006 --> 49:50.372
The bandage
is too tight.

49:50.406 --> 49:52.773
Underneath there.

50:35.013 --> 50:37.972
Hiya, boss.
Who won?

50:38.006 --> 50:40.965
Looks like our team
got in over our heads.

50:40.998 --> 50:43.972
Preposterous. Our team won, didn't it?

50:44.006 --> 50:46.373
Did you see Johnny there in action? Yeah.

50:46.964 --> 50:49.973
And that monkey with things on his
collar, the one Whanger got hold of.

50:50.006 --> 50:52.372
You see
how he fell apart?

50:52.406 --> 50:57.093
Aw, snap out of it, Wedge. Ain't we
been tangled with tough jobs before?

50:57.126 --> 51:00.004
And ain't we
always licked 'em?

51:00.613 --> 51:02.405
Well, we'll lick 'em
this time too.

51:03.013 --> 51:05.412
We won't get the chance.

51:05.446 --> 51:07.205
Navy's ordered
this island evacuated.

51:07.238 --> 51:09.013
Ridiculous.

51:09.604 --> 51:12.005
So we'll square accounts on
another island. You'll see.

51:12.038 --> 51:13.812
Something you fellas
oughta know.

51:21.012 --> 51:23.413
Go ahead, Yarrow.
Spill it.

51:26.405 --> 51:28.212
Donovan
made a mistake today.

51:28.804 --> 51:31.813
But that's one of the most
terrible things about war.

51:31.846 --> 51:35.412
You gotta think instantly, make
your moves almost without thinking.

51:35.446 --> 51:40.004
And yet, what you think or do preserves
or destroys what you value the most-

51:40.038 --> 51:42.324
your men.

51:44.724 --> 51:47.732
And when it's over, you can't
think too much about that.

51:47.766 --> 51:50.133
You can't
take it too hard...

51:50.166 --> 51:52.532
because you have to
keep right on going.

51:52.565 --> 51:54.324
I'm ordered
back to Washington.

51:54.358 --> 51:57.317
The first man I’m gonna see when
I get there is Captain Joyce.

51:57.350 --> 51:59.685
And you're
going with me.

52:14.692 --> 52:17.685
I'm here with my hat in
my hand and no alibis.

52:17.718 --> 52:20.053
I was wrong. Rotten wrong and everything.

52:20.086 --> 52:22.452
But I had to learn it
the tough way.

52:22.486 --> 52:25.444
I suppose bob told you that his
plan for a construction battalion...

52:25.478 --> 52:27.252
has been approved.

52:27.286 --> 52:30.244
Commander Yarrow has had no
other subject of conversation.

52:30.278 --> 52:33.236
Mr. Donovan helped me with the organization
of some of the specialist platoons.

52:33.270 --> 52:36.772
Our first barracks at Norfolk are
building. Recruiting is about to open.

52:36.806 --> 52:40.933
That reminds me, Donovan. You once offered
to help us find the right sort of recruits.

52:40.966 --> 52:43.332
That's right.
How many men do you need?

52:43.366 --> 52:45.733
A full battalion to begin with.
We'll need 1,100 men.

52:46.932 --> 52:48.724
Ten hundred and ninety-nine,
sir.

52:48.758 --> 52:50.533
I thought you'd say that.

52:50.566 --> 52:53.524
I'm in this thing
any way you can use me.

52:53.558 --> 52:56.532
Pushing a barrow, if
that's the best I can get.

52:56.566 --> 52:58.932
Sit down, Lieutenant Commander Donovan.

52:59.525 --> 53:01.333
Lieutenant Commander?

53:01.924 --> 53:04.884
I'm a little premature in addressing you
that way, but your papers will go through.

53:04.917 --> 53:06.645
Congratulations,
Wedge.

53:06.678 --> 53:09.652
Yes? Oh, I, uh, beg your pardon. Commander.

53:09.686 --> 53:11.445
Congratulations, sir.

53:11.478 --> 53:13.252
Yes, Admiral Scott.

53:13.286 --> 53:16.212
A name for the new
construction battalions?

53:16.246 --> 53:18.613
Well, what's the matter with
"construction battalions"?

53:19.204 --> 53:20.404
"No oomph," sir?

53:22.213 --> 53:25.204
Well, a name like that would
hardly be on my desk, sir.

53:25.238 --> 53:27.013
Hold hard, sir.

53:27.046 --> 53:28.804
I do have it.

53:29.412 --> 53:31.813
It's the initials of the words
"construction battalion."

53:31.846 --> 53:37.124
C.B.'s.
Spelled s-e-a-b-double e-s.

53:37.157 --> 53:38.933
How do you
like that?

53:38.966 --> 53:40.724
Right, sir.
Right.

53:41.332 --> 53:43.125
The Seabees
they'll be.

54:50.324 --> 54:53.924
We're the Seabees
of the navy

54:53.958 --> 54:57.524
we can build
or we can fight

54:57.558 --> 55:01.684
we'll pave the way
to victory

55:01.718 --> 55:05.284
and guard it
day and night

55:05.318 --> 55:08.884
and we promise
that we'll remember

55:09.492 --> 55:12.484
the 7th of December

55:12.518 --> 55:16.692
we're the Seabees
of the navy

55:16.726 --> 55:23.892
bees of the seven seas

55:33.012 --> 55:36.613
Donovan, the way you want this job
done will take three days longer.

55:36.646 --> 55:39.604
I don't care if it takes
three weeks longer.

55:39.637 --> 55:42.612
That's the navy way, and that's
the way you're gonna do it.

55:42.646 --> 55:45.012
And don't forget
those daily reports.

55:45.045 --> 55:47.412
All right.
You'll get your reports.

55:48.612 --> 55:52.212
Sure, I’ve changed. I was
never one for sittin' on fences.

55:52.246 --> 55:54.612
No.
How about some chow?

55:54.645 --> 55:56.404
Good.

55:56.438 --> 55:58.212
Oh, from Connie
in Honolulu.

55:58.246 --> 56:01.812
She on her way back? No, not
yet, but she's doing fine.

56:01.846 --> 56:04.804
She oughta take a good, long rest.
Two or three months, at least.

56:05.413 --> 56:09.604
Mm-hmm. Maybe by that time you'll have
figured out what you're gonna say to her.

56:18.645 --> 56:20.452
Hello? Yes. Yes-

56:20.486 --> 56:22.244
I’ll call you right back.

56:24.052 --> 56:27.044
Hello, Kitty! Oh, Connie,
it's good to see you.

56:27.077 --> 56:28.853
You look wonderful. Thank you. So do you.

56:28.886 --> 56:31.252
You've gotten a little
thinner. Oh, thank you.

56:31.285 --> 56:33.044
Oh!

56:33.652 --> 56:35.444
Oh, what beautiful
flowers.

56:35.478 --> 56:37.844
You must have had an exciting
trip. It was rather hectic.

56:38.453 --> 56:40.852
Where do we start, Kitty? With
these telephone calls, I guess.

56:40.885 --> 56:43.844
Most of them are from Comdr.
Yarrow. He's due in town today.

56:45.044 --> 56:46.852
Good!

56:46.885 --> 56:48.644
Anything from, uh,
Mr. Donovan?

56:48.678 --> 56:50.452
No.

56:51.044 --> 56:52.244
Lieutenant Commander
Donovan?

56:52.278 --> 56:54.052
No.

56:54.644 --> 56:56.452
- Maybe a telegram.
- No.

56:57.652 --> 56:59.444
Postcard?
No.

57:00.052 --> 57:03.044
Well, might as well
start work.

57:03.078 --> 57:04.852
All right.

57:17.412 --> 57:19.812
Hello, Connie.

57:19.845 --> 57:21.604
Bob!

57:21.638 --> 57:23.412
I'm so glad!

57:23.446 --> 57:25.812
You're glad.
How do you think I feel?

57:25.845 --> 57:28.212
You're just as good
as new again.

57:30.004 --> 57:32.404
How do you come to be
in Washington?

57:32.438 --> 57:35.412
For regimental orders, and to
meet some of the staff officers...

57:35.445 --> 57:38.404
who'll be responsible for
our maintenance in the field.

57:38.437 --> 57:41.413
Oh, so you can cuss them by name
if you run short of supplies.

57:41.446 --> 57:43.204
Seabees think of everything,
don't they?

57:43.238 --> 57:45.012
Some Seabees do.

57:45.045 --> 57:46.804
You heard anything
of Wedge?

57:46.838 --> 57:48.612
Only what you wrote
to me.

57:48.645 --> 57:51.012
Oh.
You didn't write him?

57:51.046 --> 57:52.804
Of course not.

57:52.837 --> 57:55.812
I told you once before that I can
take a hint as delicately put...

57:55.846 --> 57:58.212
just as well
as anybody else,

57:58.246 --> 58:01.812
and if he doesn't hanker after my
acquaintance, it won't be thrust upon him.

58:02.404 --> 58:04.804
Well, if that's the way things
are, I’d better break a date.

58:04.838 --> 58:07.204
With whom?
Oh, Wedge, of course.

58:07.238 --> 58:09.012
Wedge is here in Washington? Sure, sure.

58:09.045 --> 58:12.612
We've got a 24-hour leave. I'm meeting
him at the mayflower for dinner.

58:12.645 --> 58:15.604
Thought you might like to
go along, but if you feel-

58:15.638 --> 58:18.612
the way I feel isn't going to
interfere with your leave, or even his.

58:18.645 --> 58:21.012
Who knows
when you might get another?

58:21.046 --> 58:22.804
I'm going
to the mayflower with you.

58:22.837 --> 58:25.812
You don't think I could be
that petty, do you?

58:25.846 --> 58:29.413
After all, the three of us
have been under fire together.

58:30.612 --> 58:33.012
You wouldn't kid a pal,
would you, Connie?

58:33.604 --> 58:35.364
No.

58:35.398 --> 58:37.172
Or yourself, maybe.

58:40.132 --> 58:41.924
I don't know yet, bob.

58:55.092 --> 58:56.884
Pardon me.

58:58.084 --> 58:59.892
Martini, please.
Yes, ma'am.

59:10.692 --> 59:14.291
I'm a friend of the head
waiter, so we've got a table.

59:16.692 --> 59:18.484
[Ends

59:20.326 --> 59:22.692
Miss Chesley,
It. Comdr. Donovan.

59:26.292 --> 59:28.052
We've met.

59:28.085 --> 59:29.843
Yes.
A long time ago.

59:31.044 --> 59:32.852
Shall we find
our table?

59:35.251 --> 59:37.044
Good evening. Comdr. Yarrow's table.

59:37.652 --> 59:39.443
Paul. Comdr. Yarrow's table, please.

59:39.477 --> 59:41.844
Very good, sir.
This way, please.

59:59.844 --> 01:00:03.443
Well, this calls
for champagne.

01:00:03.477 --> 01:00:05.252
Uh, cocktails.
Very good, sir.

01:00:05.286 --> 01:00:08.243
You should've warned me. I'd
have polished up the gold braid.

01:00:08.277 --> 01:00:11.252
Your first lesson in battle tactics
- surprise attack.

01:00:11.285 --> 01:00:14.852
Your reconnaissance is faulty, Commander,
or you wouldn't have been caught napping.

01:00:14.886 --> 01:00:17.251
Yeah, but how do you
like the tailor?

01:00:17.843 --> 01:00:22.052
A gentleman and an officer, by an
act of god, congress and his tailor.

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.844
Cigarette,
Connie?

01:00:23.878 --> 01:00:26.852
You know, you could've
written a girl a postcard.

01:00:26.885 --> 01:00:29.844
And have everyone from here to
Honolulu read our mail? Not me.

01:00:30.452 --> 01:00:32.243
Such consideration
is heartbreaking.

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.764
Don't be too tough on him.
We sweated him pretty hard.

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:38.772
Sure. Boot training, officer's
training, military training.

01:00:38.805 --> 01:00:42.963
I could've walked to you for the ground
I’ve covered. Look at my broken arches.

01:00:42.997 --> 01:00:45.972
What a pity you didn't
walk on your head.

01:00:46.006 --> 01:00:48.964
Well, bob kept me
up to date on you.

01:00:48.998 --> 01:00:51.972
I know everything that's happened.
That's more than I can say.

01:00:52.005 --> 01:00:53.764
I remember
the Japs attacking.

01:00:54.372 --> 01:00:56.772
From there to the hospital
ship, the pages are missing.

01:00:56.805 --> 01:00:58.564
It's a little
embarrassing,

01:00:59.172 --> 01:01:02.771
like waking up on the street and discovering
you've forgotten to put on your shoes.

01:01:06.372 --> 01:01:09.364
Did I do or say anything
I shouldn't?

01:01:09.397 --> 01:01:12.372
Huh? No!
Shall we dance?

01:01:12.405 --> 01:01:14.164
Yes.

01:01:36.964 --> 01:01:39.972
I'm still waiting for you
to tell me what happened.

01:01:40.005 --> 01:01:42.372
You still have
beautiful eyes,

01:01:42.406 --> 01:01:45.363
and you cook corned beef and cabbage
better than anyone else in the world.

01:01:45.397 --> 01:01:47.172
That I remember.

01:01:47.764 --> 01:01:50.164
You really wanna know
what you said?

01:01:50.197 --> 01:01:53.172
Well, you said, just before
you passed out, quote-

01:01:53.205 --> 01:01:56.164
you think you're an
important ape, don't you?

01:01:56.198 --> 01:02:00.372
Just because a girl lets you hold
her hand in a moment of weakness,

01:02:00.405 --> 01:02:02.772
don't get funny ideas,

01:02:02.805 --> 01:02:05.764
'cause I’m still dancing
with the guy what brung me.

01:02:06.372 --> 01:02:08.164
I said that to you?

01:02:08.197 --> 01:02:11.172
Well, I couldn't vouch
for the exact words.

01:02:11.206 --> 01:02:12.964
And what did you say
[ends

01:02:13.572 --> 01:02:15.972
I said
you were dead right.

01:02:18.372 --> 01:02:21.364
Is that the way you
want the record to read?

01:02:21.397 --> 01:02:24.371
That's the way
I want it to read.

01:02:29.764 --> 01:02:31.572
Good night,
Miss Chesley.

01:02:32.164 --> 01:02:35.764
Oh, I was telling Connie
I forgot I had a date.

01:02:35.798 --> 01:02:37.572
And there she is.

01:02:40.564 --> 01:02:43.572
Probably burning
after waiting an hour.

01:02:43.605 --> 01:02:46.564
Well, uh, I’ll be
seeing you both.

01:02:46.597 --> 01:02:48.371
Have fun.

01:02:52.563 --> 01:02:54.964
Looks like we're stood up.

01:03:15.972 --> 01:03:18.372
Looks like
we're not the only ones.

01:03:40.563 --> 01:03:42.372
Here we are.

01:03:53.172 --> 01:03:54.963
Won't you come in?

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:56.772
No, thanks.
I'd rather not.

01:03:58.564 --> 01:04:02.164
Bob, I wanna tell you that I
know you're the best there is.

01:04:02.197 --> 01:04:03.924
But that
you don't want me.

01:04:03.957 --> 01:04:07.491
Of course I want you.
I've always wanted you.

01:04:07.525 --> 01:04:09.892
Whatever else
may have happened,

01:04:10.483 --> 01:04:14.692
I know I’ve let you down,
but I just can help myself.

01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:20.083
I wish there was something I could
say against him, but I can't now.

01:04:20.117 --> 01:04:23.684
Whatever was wrong with him
before, and there was plenty,

01:04:23.717 --> 01:04:25.491
the Seabees
have made right.

01:04:26.691 --> 01:04:29.684
I just can't seem to
get him out of my heart.

01:04:29.717 --> 01:04:32.692
Whenever I come near him-
you can't help that.

01:04:34.483 --> 01:04:36.803
That's the way I feel
about you.

01:04:39.812 --> 01:04:41.572
He turned me down
tonight.

01:04:41.605 --> 01:04:43.923
Yes, I know he did.

01:04:43.957 --> 01:04:46.211
You know?

01:04:46.245 --> 01:04:47.892
How?

01:04:50.772 --> 01:04:53.731
Because I overheard what
you told him on the island.

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:55.524
Oh, bob.

01:04:57.332 --> 01:05:00.243
And you can still
talk to me like this?

01:05:00.277 --> 01:05:03.843
For the same reason you're
still reaching after him.

01:05:03.877 --> 01:05:06.852
I just told you-
I can't help it.

01:05:10.324 --> 01:05:12.115
Thanks
for understanding.

01:05:13.283 --> 01:05:15.091
You'd better
go to bed now.

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:18.019
All this excitement
is too much for you.

01:05:18.612 --> 01:05:20.403
I guess it is.

01:05:21.604 --> 01:05:24.003
Good night.
Hey.

01:05:25.203 --> 01:05:27.604
I thought a sailor always
kissed a girl good night.

01:05:27.637 --> 01:05:30.003
It's a old
navy custom.

01:05:37.764 --> 01:05:39.572
Good night, my dear.

01:05:39.605 --> 01:05:41.363
My very dear.

01:05:41.396 --> 01:05:44.372
It's not good night, Connie,
it's good-bye.

01:05:44.405 --> 01:05:46.163
But why good-bye?

01:05:46.197 --> 01:05:49.763
My orders this morning were to take
the regiment to the pacific coast...

01:05:49.797 --> 01:05:51.571
to a port
of embarkation.

01:06:04.323 --> 01:06:07.924
Well, I hope the old man'll
have some good news for us.

01:06:07.958 --> 01:06:10.323
There's only one thing I want to hear.

01:06:10.357 --> 01:06:12.132
Good morning, Captain. Good morning, sir.

01:06:12.166 --> 01:06:14.532
Good morning.
Gentlemen.

01:06:14.565 --> 01:06:17.523
I have the orders
you've been hoping for.

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:22.324
The regiment will assemble with full service
equipment for embarkation at 2200 tonight.

01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:24.131
That's good.
Great.

01:06:24.165 --> 01:06:27.732
I can say to Comdr. Yarrow, and to
you battalion Commanders as well,

01:06:27.765 --> 01:06:31.332
that I believe your men are ready
for whatever lies before you.

01:06:31.365 --> 01:06:34.931
Naturally, it is a particular
satisfaction to be able to say that...

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:39.123
in the case of a unit which is making
its first appearance in naval history.

01:06:39.157 --> 01:06:42.132
You have a chance to make
Seabee traditions,

01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:44.531
and I feel confident
that you'll make them.

01:06:44.565 --> 01:06:47.523
That's all, gentlemen. Good
luck, Commander. Thank you, sir.

01:06:47.557 --> 01:06:49.331
Good luck.
Thank you.

01:07:06.852 --> 01:07:09.251
So that leaves the situation
something like this-

01:07:09.285 --> 01:07:12.851
oh, by the way, Kane, have you made
preparations for landing the galley equipment?

01:07:12.885 --> 01:07:14.643
Yes, sir.
Fine.

01:07:14.677 --> 01:07:17.043
Uh, how's Hunter,
Wedge?

01:07:17.077 --> 01:07:19.443
He's making the trip
by rail.

01:07:19.477 --> 01:07:23.043
I was just telling the boys that yesterday a
marine landing force cleared out our sector.

01:07:23.651 --> 01:07:25.444
We're ready to move in.
No Japs left?

01:07:25.477 --> 01:07:27.251
Only snipers
and small patrols.

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:30.244
Naturally, you're expected to
protect yourself against them.

01:07:30.278 --> 01:07:32.052
Good.

01:07:32.643 --> 01:07:34.451
Our main base
will be here.

01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:38.052
We'll disperse our installation so the
Japs can't lay all their eggs in one basket.

01:07:38.085 --> 01:07:41.043
Kane and Brackett will handle
the beaches, Stewart the docks.

01:07:41.077 --> 01:07:44.051
Hunter's outfit'll
take care of the airfield,

01:07:44.085 --> 01:07:46.451
that is, if he ever gets
over his seasickness.

01:07:47.043 --> 01:07:49.444
That leaves the oil farm for
me. It's a hot corner too.

01:07:49.478 --> 01:07:51.251
Five miles
from anybody.

01:07:51.843 --> 01:07:54.163
These shoal waters have some narrow
channels in 'em. Watch 'em, Wedge.

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:57.172
The Japs might try to sneak in
patrols in small boats. I will.

01:07:57.763 --> 01:07:59.571
When do we land?

01:07:59.604 --> 01:08:01.364
Tomorrow at dawn.

01:09:52.962 --> 01:09:54.771
Japs or polecats.

01:09:54.805 --> 01:09:57.172
Looks like we're alone.
Yeah, so far.

01:09:57.205 --> 01:09:58.963
This'll be
the campsite.

01:09:58.997 --> 01:10:02.563
It. Hood, we'll go up the crest
and establish a line of resistance.

01:10:02.597 --> 01:10:04.371
Whanger,
sully, Murph,

01:10:04.405 --> 01:10:06.771
Brick, Yump,
Swede, Jacobs.

01:10:06.805 --> 01:10:09.171
I'll stay here
and mind the fire.

01:10:24.771 --> 01:10:27.171
Yump, get down.

01:10:27.205 --> 01:10:30.164
Don't worry, Commander.
There ain't no Japs here.

01:10:30.197 --> 01:10:32.563
Yump!

01:10:38.483 --> 01:10:40.291
Brick!

01:10:43.283 --> 01:10:47.491
Turn me loose! I'll get that Jap
sniper! Get ahold of yourself!

01:10:47.525 --> 01:10:49.283
Jacobs.
Yes, sir.

01:10:51.091 --> 01:10:54.083
I want a machine gun emplacement
here and one over on that spur...

01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:55.891
so we can cross-fire
this area.

01:10:55.924 --> 01:10:57.683
Aye, aye, sir.

01:10:58.291 --> 01:11:01.284
Signal the ship we're ready
to start unloading operation.

01:11:03.091 --> 01:11:05.443
Keep your chin up, kid.

01:11:59.411 --> 01:12:01.812
Harcroft!

01:12:06.003 --> 01:12:07.811
Yes, sir?
Where's Mr. Donovan?

01:12:07.845 --> 01:12:10.803
Tank number five, sir,
over back of the ridge.

01:12:19.203 --> 01:12:21.011
Hello.

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:23.411
Was wondering when we'd rate another visit.

01:12:23.444 --> 01:12:25.123
I meant to get over
sooner, Wedge,

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:27.523
but I’m kinda busy myself.

01:12:27.557 --> 01:12:29.331
Hey,
you're doing fine here.

01:12:29.365 --> 01:12:32.323
First tankers ordered in next week. Good.

01:12:32.357 --> 01:12:36.532
Fifty thousand barrels of
oil oughta whet our appetite.

01:12:36.565 --> 01:12:38.931
Could take a hundred if it
weren't for these snipers.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:41.332
Had three men
hit today.

01:13:04.131 --> 01:13:07.123
Where'd they get you? Only the leg, Wedge.

01:13:09.523 --> 01:13:11.331
I'll make it.

01:13:11.923 --> 01:13:13.730
Stay put.

01:13:13.764 --> 01:13:16.131
Bill, get a stretcher!

01:13:16.723 --> 01:13:20.323
What do they expect a handful of patrols
to do, clean out this whole jungle?

01:13:20.356 --> 01:13:22.131
Give me
a couple of companies...

01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:23.923
and I’ll clean it out,
pronto.

01:13:23.957 --> 01:13:27.523
You're not here to fight Japs. You're
here to fight time, and you're doing great.

01:13:27.556 --> 01:13:31.123
Yeah, doing great, watching my men get
knocked off like ducks in a birdbath.

01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:34.132
What's the sense of it?
That's what I’d like to know.

01:13:37.731 --> 01:13:40.723
Our job is to see that our
task force gets oil. Task force?

01:13:41.331 --> 01:13:44.931
Yes. There's a carrier, a couple of
cruisers and three transports coming in.

01:13:44.965 --> 01:13:47.923
You're here to see that
this depot gets finished.

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:50.931
Defend it if you have to, but
get the job done. Yes, sir.

01:13:59.331 --> 01:14:01.123
That's it, Wedge.

01:14:01.156 --> 01:14:03.523
That's it if Powers has
finished the main gate.

01:14:13.123 --> 01:14:16.131
Lieutenant Hood's compliments,
sir. I mean respects, sir.

01:14:16.164 --> 01:14:17.923
The tanker's ready
to start pumpin'.

01:14:17.957 --> 01:14:20.931
We'll open the main valve as soon
as the last section is completed.

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:23.331
Thanks, Collins,
stand by to load stretchers!

01:14:26.323 --> 01:14:28.131
She's ready, chief.
Open 'er up.

01:14:28.723 --> 01:14:31.731
Mr. Powers, we've done many
a job together, you and I.

01:14:31.765 --> 01:14:34.723
Sure, with me doin' the work
and you the thinkin'.

01:14:34.756 --> 01:14:37.731
Nevertheless, you're gonna get
the honor of finishing this job.

01:14:37.765 --> 01:14:41.332
Turn that valve. And remember,
you're not windin' a watch.

01:14:41.365 --> 01:14:44.883
Yes, sir, Mr. Donovan.
Yes, sir.

01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:49.683
Ireland
must be heaven

01:14:49.716 --> 01:14:52.083
for my mother came

01:14:52.117 --> 01:14:54.482
from there

01:14:54.516 --> 01:14:56.291
Ireland
ya-da-da-dee

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:59.283
dum ya-da-da-dee

01:15:02.883 --> 01:15:05.284
Ireland-

01:15:13.091 --> 01:15:16.083
tell Lieutenant Hood I want
every man not on guard duty...

01:15:16.117 --> 01:15:17.843
with full combat
equipment.

01:15:17.876 --> 01:15:20.242
But, Wedge, Commander
Yarrow's coming here today.

01:15:20.276 --> 01:15:23.251
I don't care if the old man's
comin' here. That's an order!

01:15:28.051 --> 01:15:29.842
Your orders clear?
Aye, aye, sir.

01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:32.243
Proceed with
your scouting parties.

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:34.051
Carry on, men.

01:16:11.251 --> 01:16:13.042
Here it is, sir.

01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:15.443
Big fog bank
north of the island.

01:16:16.051 --> 01:16:18.451
I don't like that. Japs
might sneak in behind it.

01:16:18.484 --> 01:16:21.442
In pea soup? They're as
blind as we are in that stuff.

01:16:21.476 --> 01:16:23.250
I wasn't thinking
of planes, Lieutenant.

01:16:23.284 --> 01:16:26.243
A lot of surface craft could
float in under that blanket.

01:16:26.276 --> 01:16:29.251
I'll be over at It. Comdr. Donovan's
headquarters if you want me.

01:16:44.851 --> 01:16:47.843
Where's It. Comdr. Donovan?
He's out there, sir.

01:16:47.877 --> 01:16:51.442
Took about the whole force to run
the Japs out of the jungle cover.

01:16:51.476 --> 01:16:53.251
Who's in charge here?

01:16:53.285 --> 01:16:56.242
I am, sir. Couldn't get along
so good with this game leg.

01:16:56.276 --> 01:16:59.842
How many men have you got? Counting
cooks, yeomen and everybody, about 15 men.

01:16:59.876 --> 01:17:04.051
I want every man that can walk or hold a
rifle to fall in immediately. Aye, aye, sir.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:24.963
They won't fight.
They just fade away.

01:17:24.996 --> 01:17:26.770
How about It. Hood?

01:17:26.804 --> 01:17:30.371
It was the same there. They got a
few, but the others kept movin' back.

01:17:30.404 --> 01:17:32.771
Well, there's 10 or 12 here
won't go back.

01:17:56.771 --> 01:17:59.171
Pass the word to reform!

01:18:19.571 --> 01:18:22.563
Tell them we'll refuel them as
fast as they can get here. Yes, sir.

01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:55.571
All guns,
commence firing.

01:19:46.563 --> 01:19:48.371
D-21 tower
from fox 20.

01:19:48.963 --> 01:19:51.363
Carrier flight planes coming
in for fuel and ammunition.

01:19:54.371 --> 01:19:57.363
Tell them to come in low
at east end. Condition red.

01:20:01.571 --> 01:20:03.363
Roger.

01:21:59.091 --> 01:22:00.882
They're all here,
sir.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:04.483
Coast battalion's under attack
from the sea. Unable to send help.

01:22:04.516 --> 01:22:07.490
A strong Jap force approaching
up the north canyon, sir.

01:22:07.524 --> 01:22:09.283
Carry on.
Aye, aye, sir.

01:22:09.316 --> 01:22:11.682
The Japs know this island
as well as we do.

01:22:11.716 --> 01:22:14.083
The best approach to our tanks
is up the big ravine.

01:22:14.116 --> 01:22:17.042
We'll post our men and command
the entrance. Aye, aye, sir.

01:22:17.076 --> 01:22:20.002
Fix your bayonets and
follow me, on the double.

01:23:22.403 --> 01:23:24.210
Fall back!
Fall back, men!

01:23:24.244 --> 01:23:26.610
Fall back, men!
Fall back to the ridge!

01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:02.562
See if...
Commander Donovan's back.

01:24:02.596 --> 01:24:04.370
Get word to him.

01:24:04.404 --> 01:24:06.130
I want to see him.

01:24:06.164 --> 01:24:08.530
Yes, sir.

01:24:39.730 --> 01:24:42.130
Commander Yarrow
wants to see you, sir.

01:24:42.165 --> 01:24:43.922
He's up there
behind those rocks.

01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:46.931
Tell Lieutenant Hood to
consolidate positions and hold here.

01:24:46.964 --> 01:24:48.722
Aye, aye, sir.

01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.522
Reporting, sir.

01:25:10.883 --> 01:25:12.643
Upon completion
of this mission,

01:25:12.676 --> 01:25:15.602
I'll be making a full report about your...

01:25:15.636 --> 01:25:18.002
disobedience
of orders.

01:25:18.036 --> 01:25:20.402
Probably mean
a court-martial.

01:25:20.436 --> 01:25:22.803
Yes, sir.
Is that all?

01:25:24.002 --> 01:25:25.810
Island is under
general attack.

01:25:26.403 --> 01:25:28.210
I know.

01:25:28.802 --> 01:25:31.811
If those oil tanks
are destroyed,

01:25:31.844 --> 01:25:33.571
every ship,

01:25:33.604 --> 01:25:37.122
every man in our task force
will be left helpless.

01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:39.522
Protect those tanks
at any cost.

01:25:39.556 --> 01:25:41.330
They will be, sir.

01:25:41.364 --> 01:25:44.323
Go on, Seabee.
Hold the island.

01:25:45.522 --> 01:25:46.722
Can do, sir.

01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:55.491
Jap tanks. Tell Donovan. Okay.

01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:07.490
Jap tanks are coming
up the north canyon, sir.

01:26:07.523 --> 01:26:09.282
Get back
to your post.

01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:19.491
Mike, have 'em get that heavy equipment
moved back where it'll be safe.

01:26:20.082 --> 01:26:21.890
Aye, aye, sir.

01:26:21.924 --> 01:26:23.683
They're bringin' in tanks!

01:28:00.162 --> 01:28:03.170
That'll teach 'em to monkey
with construction men.

01:28:36.162 --> 01:28:39.170
- What did you shoot him for?
- I was afraid the fall might kill 'im.

01:28:51.762 --> 01:28:53.569
Get on that tank!

01:28:53.603 --> 01:28:55.362
A hundred and fifty
yards.

01:29:07.362 --> 01:29:10.370
Another column. Looks like
they're trying to outflank us.

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:39.138
There's another Jap column comin'
up the canyon behind the oil tanks.

01:29:39.171 --> 01:29:40.930
Wedge, if they fire
those tanks-

01:29:41.538 --> 01:29:43.937
it'll barbecue every Seabee in this ravine.

01:29:43.971 --> 01:29:46.930
We can't split our forces.
We're outnumbered now.

01:29:46.963 --> 01:29:49.330
Get me a thermite bomb
and some wire.

01:29:59.538 --> 01:30:01.330
What are you
gonna do?

01:30:01.364 --> 01:30:03.137
Beat 'em
to those tanks.

01:30:03.171 --> 01:30:06.130
Gonna set off number three.
We'll have our own barbecue.

01:30:06.164 --> 01:30:10.338
That'll fill that north canyon with enough hot
oil to scorch those nips back six generations.

01:30:10.372 --> 01:30:12.738
Don't ride it too close.
Give yourself time to jump.

01:30:13.331 --> 01:30:15.138
Don't worry.
I'm not taking any chances.

01:30:15.172 --> 01:30:16.931
Finish that.
Aye, sir.

01:30:16.964 --> 01:30:20.530
I want every spare machine gun at the
head of this canyon. Rake the whole ravine.

01:30:20.563 --> 01:30:23.538
But they've passed there
already. They'll be back.

01:30:23.572 --> 01:30:26.530
Hold your fire till you get 'em
under your guns, then let 'em have it.

01:31:53.554 --> 01:31:55.842
The president of
the united states...

01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:59.442
takes pleasure in presenting the services
set forth in the following citation...

01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:04.242
for conspicuous courage and
heroism in combat at island x-371...

01:32:04.276 --> 01:32:07.842
during June, 1942,

01:32:07.875 --> 01:32:09.650
at which time
this battalion,

01:32:09.684 --> 01:32:12.642
greatly outnumbered and at a
great cost of their own men,

01:32:12.675 --> 01:32:14.451
refused
to give ground...

01:32:14.484 --> 01:32:17.441
and with typical
American resourcefulness...

01:32:17.475 --> 01:32:21.041
overturned a burning fuel tank
in the path of the enemy,

01:32:21.075 --> 01:32:23.442
wiping out
his landing force...

01:32:23.476 --> 01:32:26.450
and thus preserving
our refueling base.

01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:30.050
Your deeds
speak for themselves...

01:32:30.083 --> 01:32:32.449
and will continue
to do so...

01:32:32.483 --> 01:32:35.441
from the shores
of the pacific...

01:32:35.476 --> 01:32:37.250
to the arctic,

01:32:37.283 --> 01:32:42.050
from the coasts of Europe to
the distant strands of Asia.

01:32:42.083 --> 01:32:46.242
Memorials on which will be
inscribed, in blood and fire,

01:32:46.275 --> 01:32:49.842
your own immortal challenge:

01:32:49.875 --> 01:32:52.242
"We build
for the fighters.

01:32:52.276 --> 01:32:54.642
We fight for what we build."

01:32:57.650 --> 01:33:01.250
Oh, son, how are you?
It's so nice to see you.

01:33:04.242 --> 01:33:06.049
I'm proud of you,
bob.

01:33:06.083 --> 01:33:07.842
Proud of
all the Seabees.

01:33:07.876 --> 01:33:10.849
Wedge was a great guy,
Connie. One of the best.

01:33:10.883 --> 01:33:12.642
Yes, he was.

01:33:13.842 --> 01:33:16.242
You're both great guys.

01:33:16.276 --> 01:33:18.050
You loved him,
didn't you?

01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:21.042
I loved you both.

01:33:21.076 --> 01:33:24.642
That might be a little difficult
to understand, but it's true.

01:33:24.675 --> 01:33:27.650
It's not too difficult.

01:33:27.684 --> 01:33:30.642
When the reports of the attack
came in over the teletype...

01:33:30.676 --> 01:33:33.650
and we didn't know whether
any of you would come back-

01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:38.450
a girl can be in love with
two men at the same time...

01:33:38.483 --> 01:33:40.242
until that happens.

01:33:42.642 --> 01:33:44.449
What are you trying
to say?

01:33:45.042 --> 01:33:47.442
I'm doing a very bad job
of saying...

01:33:47.475 --> 01:33:49.250
I love you, Commander.

01:33:54.642 --> 01:33:58.241
We're the Seabees
of the navy

01:33:58.275 --> 01:34:02.450
we can build
or we can fight

01:34:02.483 --> 01:34:06.050
we'll pave our way
to victory

01:34:06.083 --> 01:34:08.449
and guard it
day and night

01:34:08.483 --> 01:34:12.049
we'll always promise

01:34:12.083 --> 01:34:13.842
that we'll remember

01:34:13.876 --> 01:34:17.441
the 7th of December

01:34:18.049 --> 01:34:24.162
we're the Seabees
of the navy

01:34:24.195 --> 01:34:28.370
bees of the seven

01:34:28.403 --> 01:34:33.282
seas

01:34:33.315 --> 01:34:35.681
building

01:34:35.715 --> 01:34:37.490
fighting

01:34:37.523 --> 01:34:41.554
Seabees

01:34:42.305 --> 01:34:48.682
