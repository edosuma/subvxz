(Pen scratching)

00:29.780 --> 00:30.948
(Ice cubes rattling in glass)

00:32.324 --> 00:33.701
Ricky, why would you let

00:33.742 --> 00:35.285
the fucking door close behind us?

00:35.327 --> 00:37.078
Now we can't get to the tour bus

00:37.120 --> 00:38.914
and it's fucking chilly here, if

00:37.120 --> 00:38.914
you didn't notice!

00:38.956 --> 00:40.457
I'm fucking stressed out, okay?

00:40.499 --> 00:41.876
I talked to Lucy on the phone this morning.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.878
She got me all worked up,

00:41.917 --> 00:43.878
hot and bothered.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.129
She talked about her warm mouth

00:43.919 --> 00:46.129
drinking coffee...

00:46.171 --> 00:48.549
I'm fucking horny! Rick, you've got to

00:46.171 --> 00:48.549
stay focused, man.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.800
We've got to make some money.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.219
This is getting fucking ridiculous, boys!

00:52.260 --> 00:53.762
Welcome to Helsinki, dick-lickers.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.390
Ricky: Suck me off!

00:53.804 --> 00:56.390
Give me the fucking sheet!

00:56.431 --> 00:58.726
What the fuck bullshit do we have

00:56.431 --> 00:58.726
on the go today?

00:58.767 --> 01:01.395
"Taxi ride, sing a song, 25 bucks.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.397
"Do an ice sculpture, 25.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.899
"Do the news, $25.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.984
"Okay, here we go: meet the real Santa

01:07.026 --> 01:09.570
"and share a glass of traditional

01:07.026 --> 01:09.570
'poronkuse' together.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.071
"Note: all three of you need to drink it

01:11.112 --> 01:13.574
in order to get paid. $1,000."

01:13.615 --> 01:15.325
This is what we're doing.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.325
Hold the fuck on!

01:15.367 --> 01:16.577
Did you say the real Santa?

01:16.618 --> 01:18.078
Are you fucking shitting me?

01:18.119 --> 01:19.663
That's what it says on the sheet.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.665
Ricky: Boys, having Christmas

01:19.705 --> 01:21.665
drinks with the big guy?

01:21.707 --> 01:23.584
That's fucking amazing! Ricky, just wait now.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.502
Who are you talking about when you say "the big guy"?

01:25.544 --> 01:27.755
Look, what's the fucking catch

01:25.544 --> 01:27.755
to that?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.256
That sounds way too easy.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.841
Let's just do the easy ones,

01:30.883 --> 01:32.801
the cheap ones, Julian. Fuck the cheap ones!

01:32.843 --> 01:34.595
We're going for the big one, man!

01:34.636 --> 01:36.179
We're meeting Santa, we're getting paid

01:34.636 --> 01:36.179
1,000 bucks.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.765
Creeps, do whatever you want.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.350
I'm going to go out and get my candy

01:37.806 --> 01:40.350
cane licked.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.811
Fuck off! Let's go meet Santa.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.813
God, he does a lot of sex stuff.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.524
Ricky: How fucking cool is this?

01:47.566 --> 01:49.651
We get to have drinks with the real Santa!

01:49.693 --> 01:51.653
Yeah, the real one.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.280
So this is the North Pole?

01:53.321 --> 01:55.449
Well, we're pretty far north, Ricky,

01:55.490 --> 01:56.951
and there's poles everywhere.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.493
Julian: Well at least it's

01:56.992 --> 01:58.493
not as cold here.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.495
This is so fucking cool. So like,

01:58.535 --> 02:00.495
he is just Santa?

02:00.537 --> 02:01.956
He's not Jesus or God...?

02:01.997 --> 02:03.707
No. Just Santa. Just Santa.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.960
Fuck, this is cool. Just Santa.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.962
(Birds chirping)

02:08.003 --> 02:09.546
My fuck, boys, there he is!

02:12.091 --> 02:14.301
This is so fucking cool!

02:14.342 --> 02:15.886
Santa!

02:15.928 --> 02:17.846
Hey! Oh, hello, boys!

02:17.888 --> 02:19.556
This is cool. How are you? Yes.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.182
These are my reindeer.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.182
(Mixed greetings)

02:21.224 --> 02:22.726
Well, some of them.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.478
I've a really, really big herd.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.354
This is cool. But now I have...

02:24.519 --> 02:26.354
(indistinct)

02:26.396 --> 02:28.148
Please come in. Sure.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.567
Open the gate and...

02:30.609 --> 02:32.903
and I can...

02:32.945 --> 02:34.529
soon I can serve you

02:34.571 --> 02:36.573
a really, really special drink.

02:36.615 --> 02:39.076
His name is Niila.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.911
Niila? Niila?

02:39.118 --> 02:40.911
Niila.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.330
N-I-I-L-A.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.248
Don't remember him from the song.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.084
I've met lots of mall Santas over the years,

02:47.126 --> 02:48.836
but I never thought I'd actually meet the

02:47.126 --> 02:48.836
real fucking Santa

02:48.877 --> 02:50.504
and get to feed his reindeer.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.171
I can't wait to party and get drunk as fuck

02:52.213 --> 02:54.008
with that cocksucker. This is awesome!

02:54.049 --> 02:56.593
Bubbles: Now, we're supposed

02:54.049 --> 02:56.593
to have a drink of...

02:56.635 --> 02:58.428
poron... poronkuse?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.514
Poronkuse. Poronkuse.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.851
Poronkuse.  That makes you

03:00.555 --> 03:03.851
very strong boy.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.686
Here, feed him, Rick.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.686
Here, do you want some?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.228
Feed him some...

03:07.270 --> 03:08.522
Look at that.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.189
This is so fucking cool.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.026
You're feeding one of Santa's

03:10.231 --> 03:12.026
reindeers, Ricky.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.902
(Chuckling) Santa:

03:12.067 --> 03:13.902
Okay...

03:13.944 --> 03:15.194
Ricky: This is awesome.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.280
Here we are. (Grunting)

03:17.322 --> 03:19.700
Julian: What's he doing,

03:17.322 --> 03:19.700
trying to milk him?

03:19.741 --> 03:22.201
Maybe it's, uh... (Urinating)

03:22.243 --> 03:24.579
Maybe it's like a reindeer

03:22.243 --> 03:24.579
White Russian.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.374
No, no, this is much, much better than milk.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.126
This is poronkuse.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.628
You drink that every day?

03:29.168 --> 03:31.628
Every morning.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.380
When I wake up, then I drink this

03:33.421 --> 03:36.591
a little bit. Just a small cup.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.969
It's very refreshing also.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.554
It's kind of neat to be here

03:40.595 --> 03:42.222
at the "real" Santa's village

03:42.263 --> 03:44.725
in Finland, but when you...

03:44.766 --> 03:46.434
when you break it down, all it really is

03:46.476 --> 03:48.062
(Whispering) is just some crazy

03:46.476 --> 03:48.062
bastard in a suit

03:48.103 --> 03:50.397
out in the woods drinking piss.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.233
Okay, my boys, here we go.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.069
Now you'll get it. Ugh...

03:55.110 --> 03:59.239
I promised you to have reindeer piss

03:59.280 --> 04:02.951
and, as we say in Finland, poronkuse.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.286
It makes you very strong...

04:06.621 --> 04:11.835
and will send you to another new planet!

04:11.877 --> 04:14.421
Oh, it fucks you up?

04:11.877 --> 04:14.421
Okay, I know...

04:14.462 --> 04:16.590
I think you are Ricky.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.590
Yes.

04:16.631 --> 04:19.760
Yeah, I know that you'll love this stuff.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.596
It's very good for you. Okay.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.305
I didn't give a fuck what kind of piss I was drinking.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.599
If it was going to get me high,

04:25.640 --> 04:27.434
I'll drink fucking "allimigator" piss,

04:27.475 --> 04:29.019
fucking zebra piss, moose piss,

04:29.061 --> 04:30.437
fucking squirrel piss.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.313
I'd even a fucking honey badger's piss.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.648
Now, okay. Let's get

04:32.355 --> 04:33.648
fucked up.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.110
Bottoms up. I'm not drinking

04:33.690 --> 04:36.110
piss, Ricky.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.028
Are you kidding me? Yeah, it's not piss...

04:38.070 --> 04:40.114
I don't... I don't care if

04:38.070 --> 04:40.114
it's reindeer piss

04:40.155 --> 04:42.449
or fucking any other kind of piss.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.784
Santa: Okay, that's your choice.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.784
It's piss!

04:43.825 --> 04:45.535
Piss is piss, Santa.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.535
Okay.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.287
I'm close to starving to death right now

04:47.328 --> 04:49.330
and I haven't had much booze in me since I got here,

04:49.372 --> 04:50.999
but there's no fucking way

04:51.041 --> 04:53.127
I'm drinking reindeer piss to make money.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.003
You're gonna make me fucking puke, Ricky.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.296
Well, you guys should be doing it too.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.839
It's 1,000 fucking dollars!

04:57.881 --> 04:59.716
Ricky... I'm not wasting a

04:57.881 --> 04:59.716
buzz-on, though, boys.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.051
Fuck it. It can't been worse

05:01.093 --> 05:02.886
than the time Willy Goat pissed in my mouth.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.639
(Heavy sigh)

05:05.680 --> 05:07.348
Ricky, this is a bad idea.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.144
Piss buzz-on, here I fucking come!

05:10.185 --> 05:12.146
(Panting)

05:12.187 --> 05:15.356
(Christmas music playing in background)

05:15.398 --> 05:16.733
Okay, Ricky!

05:16.775 --> 05:18.986
You are my man! You did it!

05:19.027 --> 05:20.487
How do you taste?

05:20.528 --> 05:22.363
The taste, it was very good, yes?

05:22.405 --> 05:23.657
Oh... A little bit strong,

05:23.698 --> 05:25.325
but makes very, very good.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.578
It kind of tastes like gasoline

05:25.366 --> 05:28.578
and ocean.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.871
You sure you don't want this, boys?

05:29.913 --> 05:31.414
No. Because I need

05:29.913 --> 05:31.414
to get fucked up!

05:31.456 --> 05:32.916
I'm drinking all of it. Fuck it!

05:32.958 --> 05:34.960
(Hard exhalation) Bubbles:

05:32.958 --> 05:34.960
Ricky...

05:37.545 --> 05:39.338
(Whispering) You're spilling...

05:37.545 --> 05:39.338
Okay!

05:39.380 --> 05:41.508
Well done! Yeah, fantastic!

05:41.549 --> 05:44.719
And now I also want to have it a little bit.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.345
(Groaning, panting)

05:46.387 --> 05:49.516
(Mouthing silently) He's out of his

05:46.387 --> 05:49.516
fucking mind.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.476
Nice. Cheers, Santa.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.441
I can't fucking believe what's

05:55.897 --> 05:58.441
happening right now.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.195
I've seen Ricky do some pretty fucked up things in my life,

06:01.236 --> 06:03.947
but to drink three cups of reindeer piss

06:03.989 --> 06:06.241
just 'cause some nutcase in a suit says,

06:06.283 --> 06:08.702
"Oh, yeah, it sends you to another planet."

06:08.743 --> 06:10.578
Ricky is fucked.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.622
Ahh! You did it.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.622
Now you are strong.

06:12.664 --> 06:16.043
You will get very much strength.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.376
Yes. Or die.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.378
Either or.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.089
How long does it take to kick in?

06:21.131 --> 06:22.716
(Hard exhalation)

06:22.757 --> 06:24.634
The boys think I'm fucked for drinking it...

06:24.676 --> 06:26.553
(Stomach gurgling)

06:26.594 --> 06:28.263
...but once this shit kicks in,

06:28.305 --> 06:30.140
we'll see with who's happy with drinking piss

06:30.182 --> 06:31.933
and who's not happy about fucking drinking

06:30.182 --> 06:31.933
piss, won't we?

06:31.975 --> 06:34.393
(Stomach growling)

06:34.435 --> 06:37.231
Ohh, fuck, boys, I feel like I'm going to puke, but I...

06:37.272 --> 06:39.066
I can't puke 'cause it hasn't kicked in yet,

06:39.107 --> 06:40.775
even though it's been over an hour,

06:39.107 --> 06:40.775
for fuck's sakes!

06:40.817 --> 06:42.736
Ricky, just... Why don't you just puke?

06:42.777 --> 06:44.612
I mean, you've got to get all of that

06:42.777 --> 06:44.612
piss out of you.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.656
Piss is poisonous.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.116
Julian, give me a drink.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.993
Ricky, you're not putting your

06:48.158 --> 06:49.993
pissy lips

06:50.035 --> 06:51.745
on my glass, I said. I've got to get this

06:50.035 --> 06:51.745
taste out of my mouth.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.580
We've got to do something simple now

06:53.621 --> 06:55.082
so I can go fucking eat or something.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.833
Just got to stop thinking about

06:55.123 --> 06:56.833
fucking piss.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.585
(Liquid trickling) Ricky.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.670
What?

07:00.712 --> 07:02.714
Have a look here. Look up, bud.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.343
(Heaving) There you go.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.802
There you go. All that piss

07:07.844 --> 07:09.304
pouring out of there, buddy.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.932
(Retching)

07:11.973 --> 07:13.767
Just think of the gallons of piss

07:13.808 --> 07:16.019
coming out of that thing. (Retching)

07:16.061 --> 07:18.230
Julian: Let 'er all out, man.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.230
(Groaning)

07:20.648 --> 07:23.110
(Sighing) Okay,

07:23.151 --> 07:24.778
let's go do something fucking easy.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.696
I need to eat. What should we do?

07:26.738 --> 07:28.323
The cab or the ice sculpting?

07:28.365 --> 07:30.033
Bubbles: I don't know.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.033
Do you want to just...

07:30.075 --> 07:31.618
do the cab, maybe?

07:31.659 --> 07:32.827
It should be right up here.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.537
Singstar Taxis. Look at that wiener dog.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.124
I'm so hungry I could eat the

07:34.579 --> 07:37.124
little cocksucker.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.459
What the fuck do we got to do here?

07:39.500 --> 07:43.546
It just says, "Take ride in Singstar Taxi,

07:43.588 --> 07:46.883
sing a song, and don't talk about hockey."

07:46.925 --> 07:49.303
Like, that doesn't sound that hard.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.346
Sounds very fucking weird.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.346
Sounds easy.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.847
Too easy to be true. That sounds weird.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.808
Bubs, I can't even fucking sing,

07:52.889 --> 07:54.808
though, man.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.644
Hello. Ooh, look at this thing.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.229
Oh, right on. What do you guys

07:57.685 --> 07:59.229
want to sing?

07:59.271 --> 08:01.898
This is decent. I wonder if they've

07:59.271 --> 08:01.898
got any Helix.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.318
Yeah, Helix. I don't want to sing that.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.194
I'll sing Rush or Guns N' Roses.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.988
Julian: Iron Maiden, maybe.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.823
That'd be fucking cool. First you say

08:08.029 --> 08:09.823
you can't sing

08:09.864 --> 08:11.658
and then you pick Iron Maiden?

08:11.699 --> 08:13.368
Bubbles: Okay, boys, what are

08:11.699 --> 08:13.368
we going to do here?

08:13.410 --> 08:15.078
Julian: Something easy

08:13.410 --> 08:15.078
like "Gimme an R"

08:15.120 --> 08:17.164
or fucking Tragically Hip. Rush, maybe.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.665
"Number of the Beast". I don't see any Rush.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.334
There's no Tragically Hip.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.419

08:28.258 --> 08:30.510
I can sing it. Oh, okay!

You...

08:32.053 --> 08:34.181
Ricky: We can do the

08:32.053 --> 08:34.181

08:34.222 --> 08:35.682
The whistling song?

08:35.723 --> 08:38.018

08:38.059 --> 08:39.686

08:41.271 --> 08:43.023
Okay. Here... Can you sit here?

08:43.064 --> 08:45.692
I can't sit backwards. I get sick.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.861

08:45.733 --> 08:47.861
Switch? Yeah.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.196

This is pretty awesome. We actually

13:26.180 --> 13:28.349
do love hockey.

13:28.391 --> 13:31.185
We were supposed to not talk about

13:28.391 --> 13:31.185
hockey to make $25,

13:31.227 --> 13:32.479
but that's out the window.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.980
It's worth more than $25 to me.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.649
Well, we may as well talk about it then.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.900

13:41.696 --> 13:43.323
He played with fucking Wayne.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.699
Well, he's played with a lot of good people.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.159
I know, but he played with Wayne.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.410

13:51.080 --> 13:52.666
Yeah.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.000
He was top pick. He's a tough...

13:54.041 --> 13:55.543
(Mixed comments) ...tough bastard.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.878
Everybody was scared of him... Glory time.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.756
I would not want to fight that guy.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.841
No, no. You don't want to go even

13:59.798 --> 14:02.841
close to him. No.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.093
But that was hockey, old...

14:04.135 --> 14:06.513
good, old time hockey. Oh, yeah.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.722
Well, I'm sorry,

14:07.764 --> 14:09.848
I blew the fucking 25 dollar task,

14:09.890 --> 14:11.058
but it was worth it for me

14:11.100 --> 14:13.394
just to hear stories about the Oilers.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.229
It was pretty awesome, but we've

14:13.436 --> 14:15.229
got to find a way

14:15.271 --> 14:16.690
to make some fucking money here, boys.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.025
Oh, here, I've got the fucking list.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.568
We can go do the...

14:20.610 --> 14:21.861
The ice sculpting?

14:21.902 --> 14:23.404
...go do the ice sculpting.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.948
"Go to ArtMarika

14:25.990 --> 14:27.908
"and make an ice sculpture.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.370
Best one wins." So we'll do that.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.579
"Best one wins"? You better not

14:30.411 --> 14:31.579
fuck it up.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.790
So one of us has to win, then?

14:33.832 --> 14:35.542
Yeah.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.711
Well, that's perfect. Should have

14:35.583 --> 14:37.711
did that first.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.379
Ricky: Well, it's been

14:37.752 --> 14:39.379
nice to meet you.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.880
Well, it's nice to meet you guys.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.965
You wouldn't happen to have

14:40.921 --> 14:42.965
any weed or hash

14:43.007 --> 14:44.217
or anything on you or anything?

14:44.258 --> 14:45.760
Ricky! Ricky...

14:45.802 --> 14:48.221
Do not ask Esa Tikkanen if he's got weed or hash!

14:48.262 --> 14:50.973
Well, maybe he knows where I can get some

14:48.262 --> 14:50.973
or borrow some.

14:51.015 --> 14:54.060
Well, in Finland we don't have that one. Sorry.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.311
Great.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.646
Sorry about that. He's just...

14:56.688 --> 14:57.938
he smokes a lot

14:57.980 --> 14:59.566
and he's not that bright.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.984
You shouldn't be asking people that.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.820
Don't worry about it.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.113
All right, let's go do some fucking ice

15:03.862 --> 15:06.113
sculptures, I guess.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.574
Julian: Good to meet you.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.574
Hey!

15:07.615 --> 15:09.075
Nice to meet you guys.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.075
Awesome to meet you.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.326
Nice to meet you. Thanks.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.326
It was great.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.745
Say hi to Gretzky for me

15:11.786 --> 15:12.953
when you talk to him next.

15:11.786 --> 15:12.953
Yes, I will.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.288
(Awkward chuckle) Have a good one, guys.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.082
All right, cheers. (Mixed farewells)

15:16.123 --> 15:19.293
That was pretty fucking cool. Get the fuck out of my way!

15:19.335 --> 15:21.962
Bubbles: We should've did this one

15:19.335 --> 15:21.962
first 'cause we can't lose.

15:22.004 --> 15:25.007
It's, "go meet ArtMarika, make an ice sculpture".

15:25.049 --> 15:26.926
Whoever's got the best one

15:25.049 --> 15:26.926
gets the money.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.595
Are we going to split the money?

15:28.636 --> 15:30.513
Well, I don't know that we should.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.599
I'm a pretty sculptor. Maybe I'll keep the

15:30.555 --> 15:32.599
money part if I win.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.475
Let's get this over with. Julian:

15:32.640 --> 15:34.475
I can't do this shit.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.935
Hi. How are you doing?

15:35.976 --> 15:37.854
I guess we're supposed to be doing

15:37.896 --> 15:39.105
some ice sculpting or something.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.940
Yes. There is your tools

15:40.981 --> 15:43.150
and here is the ice box.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.278
So make your sculpture.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.780
Go, go, go, go! Decent.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.448
Did you make that kitty? That's a kitty?

15:48.489 --> 15:49.699
Yes. Kitty ice.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.451
Woman: You can make your own.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.035
Could I make a kitty like that?

15:53.077 --> 15:54.287
I'll just copy off of you.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.287
Yeah.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.456
How do you turn this baby on?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.458
(Chainsaw revving) Oh, Ricky...

15:58.499 --> 16:00.627
I wanted the chainsaw.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.379
There's another one over there, Bubs.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.379
Where?

16:03.421 --> 16:05.882
(Saws buzzing)

16:05.924 --> 16:15.683
( ♪♪ )

16:15.725 --> 16:18.478
Jesus Murphy!

16:18.519 --> 16:20.396
Holy fuck, this is cold!

16:20.438 --> 16:23.483
Bubs, I told you we should have brought

16:20.438 --> 16:23.483
fucking jackets!

16:23.524 --> 16:26.152
( ♪♪ )

16:26.193 --> 16:29.322
It's a fuck of a lot harder than it looks.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.574
What do you think, Bubs?

16:29.363 --> 16:31.574
What is it?

16:31.616 --> 16:32.992
Julian: A naked chick.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.578
Bubbles: Are those her ice boobs?

16:35.620 --> 16:36.830
How's it going, Bubs?

16:36.871 --> 16:38.665
Oh, I'm fucking soaked, Ricky.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.083
Yeah, it's not fun, is it?

16:41.125 --> 16:43.336
No, this is a bullshit task.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.838
Blew the chainsaw right apart,

16:44.879 --> 16:46.422
blew the motor right out of her.

16:46.464 --> 16:49.091
'Cause, uh, you know, I don't fuck around.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.052
When it comes to ice sculpting, I take

16:49.133 --> 16:52.052
it quite seriously.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.054
Would you smoke this, Bubs? What?

16:54.096 --> 16:56.850
Would you smoke this?

16:56.891 --> 16:59.435
Ricky, it looks like a big ice cock.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.103
Ah, fuck, does it?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.689
Well, look, it looks like the shaft

17:02.730 --> 17:05.065
and the two balls, right?

17:02.730 --> 17:05.065
Ricky...

17:05.107 --> 17:06.526
Ricky, can you press the fucking button

17:06.567 --> 17:09.445
on the back of this fucking piece of shit?

17:09.487 --> 17:11.071
What are you sculpting, a cock?

17:11.113 --> 17:12.740
It's not a cock! It's supposed

17:11.113 --> 17:12.740
to be a joint.

17:12.782 --> 17:14.742
Looks like a cock.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.911
(Sigh) Fuck.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.872
Does it really look like a cock?

17:18.913 --> 17:20.540
Big time.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.542
Bubbles: It looks more like

17:20.581 --> 17:22.542
a cock now, Ricky.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.418
Well, maybe that's what I'm making, I guess.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.629
I am making a cock now. Fuck it.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.088
That's what I was always making.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.885
Bubbles: Well, it's working.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.885
Okay. Perfect.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.721
It's definitely starting to look like a kitty.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.597
I've got to get his...

17:36.639 --> 17:39.058
That's an awful big piss hole. Fuck.

17:39.099 --> 17:40.393
Boys, I think it's pretty clear

17:40.434 --> 17:42.311
who's going to be winning the money here.

17:42.353 --> 17:45.398
Who? Cat Stevens is starting

17:42.353 --> 17:45.398
to take shape.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.234
You think that's going to win?

17:45.439 --> 17:48.234
Did you see this?

17:48.275 --> 17:49.485
All right, I changed it.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.237
This is now Arnold Schwarzenegger.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.446
"Terminator".

17:55.616 --> 17:57.243
I... Don't you find it odd

17:57.284 --> 17:59.328
that you started out making a woman

17:59.370 --> 18:01.247
and then it turned into Arnold Schwarzenegger?

18:01.288 --> 18:03.249
That might say... Why don't you

18:01.288 --> 18:03.249
shut the fuck up?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.459
maybe you're attracted to Arnold Schwarzenegger.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.459
I'm not... Bubs!

18:05.501 --> 18:06.753
Is Arnold Schwarzenegger I fucked up the face.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.629
your perfect idea of a woman?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.256
Yeah? Hey!

18:10.297 --> 18:11.674
You get...!

18:11.716 --> 18:13.509
Oh, you want to fuck around?

18:13.551 --> 18:15.845
I was just fucking playing around with Julian, you know,

18:15.887 --> 18:18.514
giving him a little teasy-weasy about his statue.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.307
He starts getting all fucking serious,

18:20.349 --> 18:22.476
taking swipes at Cat Stevens.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.186
Julian! Fuck off!

18:26.522 --> 18:28.357
Stop acting like a dick.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.610
I'm freezing my ass off trying to make us all

18:28.399 --> 18:30.610
some money here,

18:30.651 --> 18:32.695
like, trying to do a good fucking job.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.615
Don't understand why Bubbles had to be such

18:32.737 --> 18:35.615
a fucking dick to me.

18:35.656 --> 18:39.159
You put a big scratch on Cat Stevens' face!

18:40.494 --> 18:42.455
Thank you, you just helped it out.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.290
Oh, yeah?

18:44.331 --> 18:46.042
Don't, man... Bubs!

18:46.084 --> 18:48.962
Well... Don't fuck

18:46.084 --> 18:48.962
with his pecs!

18:49.003 --> 18:51.547
Well, you put a big... Now what am I supposed to do

18:51.589 --> 18:52.799
with that now?

18:52.840 --> 18:55.301
Cat Stevens has a big dent in his face.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.011
I've got to work around that now.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.513
Julian: Bubs, you totally

18:57.053 --> 18:59.513
fucked up his left pec, man!

18:59.555 --> 19:01.181
It's fucked now. Well,

19:01.223 --> 19:02.809
you shouldn't have been fucking

19:01.223 --> 19:02.809
around with...

19:02.850 --> 19:04.310
Don't... Julian!

19:04.351 --> 19:06.980
How does that feel, huh?

19:07.021 --> 19:09.023
Oh, that's how you want to fucking

19:07.021 --> 19:09.023
play it, is it?

19:09.065 --> 19:10.316
You want to play it like that?

19:10.357 --> 19:11.734
(Saw buzzing) Aww, Bubs...!

19:11.776 --> 19:14.821
Boys! Julian:

19:11.776 --> 19:14.821
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.155
Are you kidding me?

19:16.196 --> 19:17.740
Julian wanted to take it up a notch,

19:17.782 --> 19:19.158
acting like a fucking bully.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.201
I showed him how to take it up a notch!

19:24.914 --> 19:26.958
What do you think of that? Huh?

19:28.042 --> 19:29.335
Oh, that's just..

19:29.376 --> 19:31.921
(Tearfully) fucking just

19:29.376 --> 19:31.921
great, Julian!

19:31.963 --> 19:33.255
(Sniffling) Julian:

19:31.963 --> 19:33.255
That's what you get.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.676
(Mixed shouting) What are you

19:33.297 --> 19:36.676
guys doing?

19:36.717 --> 19:40.013
Well, he just cut Arnold's fucking

19:36.717 --> 19:40.013
head off.

19:40.054 --> 19:42.849
He knocked Cat Stevens right on the ground.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.851
Mine was the best, that's why.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.186
He can't let me win. Mine was the best!

19:47.227 --> 19:49.355
Mine's the best! So now what?

19:49.396 --> 19:52.025
You're going to judge them,

19:49.396 --> 19:52.025
I suppose, are you?

19:52.066 --> 19:54.443
He sculpted a cock. It was supposed

19:52.066 --> 19:54.443
to be a joint,

19:54.485 --> 19:55.695
it turned into a cock,

19:55.736 --> 19:56.946
and I think it looks pretty fucking good.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.781
Fucking worthless and weak.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.533
Ricky: Well, it's better

19:58.823 --> 20:00.533
than these ones.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.702
Julian: This still looks

20:00.574 --> 20:02.702
pretty good if...

20:02.743 --> 20:04.912
You know, it's headless, but it looks pretty good.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.540
It looks like a Greek statue or something.

20:07.581 --> 20:10.710
It looks like a torso that's been

20:07.581 --> 20:10.710
ripped in half.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.712
Oh... are you fucking kidding me?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.712
Oh, fuck,

20:12.753 --> 20:15.715
did that fall over? Aww, what a shame.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.092
What was this? That was a cat,

20:18.134 --> 20:19.719
a kitty cat, Cat Stevens.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.054
It was the shittiest- looking ice cat

20:21.095 --> 20:22.304
I've ever seen in my life.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.140
It was fucking awesome! Look at that cat

20:24.182 --> 20:25.725
and then now...

20:25.766 --> 20:26.934
That was nothing! This was pretty much

20:26.976 --> 20:28.561
an exact replica of that one.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.270
Julian: It was shit, Bubs.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.440
Who's the winner? I guess Ricky.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.650
Who wins then?

20:35.985 --> 20:37.444
Well, this wins.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.113
Look at it, it's a beautiful cat.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.113
What?

20:39.155 --> 20:40.656
Ricky: What do you mean,

20:39.155 --> 20:40.656
this wins?

20:40.698 --> 20:41.991
Julian: She's not in the contest!

20:42.033 --> 20:44.827
It says the best of the ice sculptures.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.413
This wins. You're out.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.413
For fuck's sakes!

20:47.454 --> 20:49.165
Julian: So we froze our asses

20:47.454 --> 20:49.165
off for nothing?

20:49.207 --> 20:50.917
That's not fair. Are you kidding me?

20:50.958 --> 20:53.211
That is not fair. That's fucking

20:50.958 --> 20:53.211
bullshit.

20:56.463 --> 20:57.965
Ricky: Oh, that's nice.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.633
Well, fuck it. Way to wreck my cock.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.094
We're fucked! Again!

21:01.135 --> 21:02.929
This whole trip has been fucked.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.972
I mean, obviously we're not going to beat a professional

21:05.014 --> 21:06.974
at fucking ice sculpting, for fuck's sakes.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.143
And this whole reading the weather bullshit?

21:09.185 --> 21:11.478
Pfft! I guarantee you this is going to be fucked.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.109
Bubbles: It said read the weather

21:13.480 --> 21:16.109
without getting a hard-on.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.651
Why the fuck would we get a hard-on

21:17.693 --> 21:19.445
reading the weather? This is going

21:17.693 --> 21:19.445
to be easy.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.654
I don't know. Just don't.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.281
It's some kind of a fucking trick,

21:22.322 --> 21:23.950
I guarantee you. Won't be me

21:22.322 --> 21:23.950
that fucks up.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.285
Hey, how you doing? Oh, hey, guys.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.285
Holy fuck!

21:26.326 --> 21:27.995
We're supposed to do the weather or something?

21:28.037 --> 21:30.790
Co-host it? Yeah, yeah, you can

21:28.037 --> 21:30.790
just line up here

21:30.831 --> 21:33.126
on the black line. Okay.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.126
Thank you.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.711
Yeah. Good. Bubbles:

21:33.167 --> 21:35.711
I see what they're up to.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.630
(Grunting) Fuck.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.630
Keep it together,

21:37.671 --> 21:39.132
keep it together! I'm okay!

21:39.173 --> 21:40.674
I'll just think about something else.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.219
Just think about "The Flintstones".

21:40.716 --> 21:43.219
Both of yous.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.845
Yes, I do. Check out this

21:43.261 --> 21:44.845
shit, boys.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.555
Like, it's blue back here,

21:46.597 --> 21:47.890
but here, when you look at it,

21:47.932 --> 21:49.809
it's got, like, all the clouds...

21:49.850 --> 21:51.227
Weather script, man. Blue screen,

21:51.269 --> 21:52.645
green screen, they call it.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.313
Okay, we've got a lot of fucking clouds

21:54.354 --> 21:55.648
and fucking bullshit here.

21:55.689 --> 21:56.857
It's going to fuck with some people.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.818
We've got some rain moving in

21:58.859 --> 22:00.319
and you're going to fucking piss a lot of

21:58.859 --> 22:00.319
people off with that,

22:00.360 --> 22:02.362
but it is pretty sunny down here and...

22:02.404 --> 22:03.906
Just move your cock for a sec, Bubs...

22:03.948 --> 22:06.325
and the sun here and the sun over in...

22:06.366 --> 22:07.534
Oh, your tits are in the way.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.828
With the sun over in this direction,

22:08.869 --> 22:10.997
you guys will be happy. Sun up here.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.749
Oh, fuck, boys. fucked 'er. Look.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.334
Got a hard on. (Awkward chuckle)

22:13.791 --> 22:15.334
Look,

22:15.375 --> 22:16.836
Ricky's got a... Don't even joke

22:15.375 --> 22:16.836
about it.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.504
weather arrow cock! Don't even

22:16.877 --> 22:18.504
be joking...

22:18.545 --> 22:19.880
Weather arrow cock.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.341
Ricky & Bubbles: (Imitating horns honking)

22:22.382 --> 22:23.676
How the fuck did they do that?

22:23.717 --> 22:25.178
They put, like, a naked girl on the screen.

22:25.219 --> 22:26.512
Holy fuck, Ricky, turn around.

22:26.553 --> 22:29.347
(Speaking in Finnish)

22:29.389 --> 22:30.599
Ah... Ricky. Hi.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.560
Hi, I'm shaved... I'm Bubbles.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.437
(Giggling) You're... shaved.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.731
You're not shaved, but you're shave...

22:35.479 --> 22:37.731
I don't know...

22:37.773 --> 22:40.067
Julian: Keep it together...

22:37.773 --> 22:40.067
I'm trying to.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.695
(Speaking Finnish)

22:42.736 --> 22:43.946
Think of "The Flintstones".

22:43.988 --> 22:45.531
I am thinking of "The Flintstones",

22:45.572 --> 22:46.907
but now I'm thinking about Wilma.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.201
(Groaning) Oh, fuck, boys...

22:48.242 --> 22:49.451
Ricky, what are you doing?

22:49.493 --> 22:50.786
Ricky: Fucking... I'm trying.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.038
I'm fighting this fucking thing.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.289
Well, fight it!

22:53.331 --> 22:55.457
(Sigh) Julian, uh-oh.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.960
Don't, Bubs... (Speaking Finnish)

22:58.002 --> 22:59.461
(Whispering) She pointed

22:58.002 --> 22:59.461
at my bird.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.921
She pointed right at my bird.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.921
No, she's not.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.464
She's pointing at the fucking weather screen.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.091
Well... Ricky:

23:02.506 --> 23:04.091
For fuck's sakes!

23:04.133 --> 23:05.718
Bubs, just... We're done.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.053
Julian: Are you kidding me?

23:07.094 --> 23:08.888
Boys, I've been away from Lucy too long.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.807
I can't fucking deal with it. Fucked 'er.

23:11.849 --> 23:13.767
Nice fucking going, bud. Nice going.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.561
Ricky: Well, he fucked up

23:13.809 --> 23:15.561
and you fucked up,

23:15.602 --> 23:17.063
and everyone fucks up once in a while.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.731
When did I fuck up?

23:17.104 --> 23:18.731
Look at this!

23:18.772 --> 23:20.733
Like, what the fuck do you expect?

23:20.774 --> 23:23.069
I find it weird that you didn't get one.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.570
Because I'm... Maybe I'm the one

23:24.611 --> 23:26.572
who gets it more than you.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.282
Ricky: Maybe you don't

23:26.613 --> 23:28.282
like women.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.450
Fuck you. (Speaking in Finnish)

23:31.535 --> 23:32.745
Nice to meet ya.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.496
(Speaking in Finnish)

23:34.538 --> 23:35.748
Nice to meet you.

23:35.789 --> 23:36.957
(Chuckling) Fuck.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.004
(Speaking Finnish)

23:42.046 --> 23:45.007
Julian: We've just lost the

23:42.046 --> 23:45.007
easiest $100 ever, boys.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.466
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

23:46.508 --> 23:48.094
Why'd you have to stare at her the whole time?

23:48.135 --> 23:49.595
Bubbles: Well, Julian,

23:48.135 --> 23:49.595
I'm not around

23:49.636 --> 23:51.429
fucking bare naked ladies that often,

23:51.471 --> 23:53.766
and when I am, things happen. I'm sorry.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.768
Bubs, peek, okay? Just have a little peek.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.519
You don't got to fucking stare!

23:57.561 --> 23:59.272
I wasn't fucking staring, was I?

23:57.561 --> 23:59.272
Course you were staring!

23:59.313 --> 24:01.107
No, the one-eyed mountain man was

23:59.313 --> 24:01.107
fucking staring!

24:01.148 --> 24:02.649
He's got a mind of his own.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.111
I can't control what he does.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.111
You're fucked.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.321
Tom: Ricky...

24:05.152 --> 24:07.321
You're fucked!

24:07.363 --> 24:09.447
A question for you boys.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.447
Julian: What's that?

24:09.489 --> 24:11.825
How does it feel to be complete

24:09.489 --> 24:11.825
fucking losers?

24:11.867 --> 24:14.120
What? You didn't make

24:11.867 --> 24:14.120
a goddamn penny

24:14.161 --> 24:15.955
for yourselves again today,

24:15.996 --> 24:18.456
and we're heading to Amsterdam.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.456
Julian: What?

24:18.498 --> 24:20.834
Which is really unfortunate

24:18.498 --> 24:20.834
for you guys.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.378
You better be fucking joking right now.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.213
Amsterdam? Yup.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.464
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, boys.

24:26.506 --> 24:28.801
We can't go to fucking Amsterdam with no money!

24:28.842 --> 24:31.011
The best goddamn weed in the world too, Ricky.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.139
Too bad you're not going to be able

24:31.053 --> 24:33.139
to buy any of it.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.141
See you hole tonguers back at the bus.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.143
Wheels up in an hour.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.852
Hole tonguers?

24:38.894 --> 24:40.146
I hope this was worth it, boys.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.897
I hope it was fucking worth it.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.149
Ricky: Way to go.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.817
Way to go, you fucking asshole.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.235
Fucking Amsterdam with no money!

24:46.277 --> 24:47.485
You fucking idiot!

24:47.527 --> 24:49.487
Fuck, Ricky!

24:49.529 --> 24:51.907
You're punching yourself in the bird!

24:53.533 --> 25:08.466
( ♪♪ )

26:23.040 --> 26:25.376
(Seabirds squawking)

26:38.472 --> 26:42.142
Fish: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

26:42.184 --> 26:45.812
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

26:49.066 --> 26:50.443
(Whisper) Fuck.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.403
(Light clicks off) Fuck off.
