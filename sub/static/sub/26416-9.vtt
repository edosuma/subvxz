00:15.189 --> 00:18.018
Yeah, we know all about that
Native American medicine.

00:18.540 --> 00:21.021
But we were nowhere near
the Grand Canyon.

00:23.371 --> 00:26.417
I sure hope these water keepers
are friendly.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.333
You got to be kidding.

00:30.421 --> 00:31.118
Doc!

00:49.745 --> 00:52.530
It's the chafing that really
gets to you after a while,

00:52.574 --> 00:53.749
you know?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.359
Or the butt sores
from sitting all day?

00:55.403 --> 00:57.796
You'd think they could turn
a guy once in a while, right?

00:57.840 --> 00:59.885
And of course,
there's the constant decay.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.018
Hey. 10K. Wake up.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.064
But that's what they do
to saboteurs.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.762
And I am, you know, a saboteur.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.894
Saboteur.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.853
Sounds rather continental.

01:12.246 --> 01:14.465
Saboteur, c'est moi!

01:14.857 --> 01:16.206
Ow, quit it.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.601
Your friend there
looks a little pale.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.256
I'm not a Talker.

01:22.299 --> 01:24.301
Then how come
your hand fell off?

01:24.649 --> 01:26.347
Hey, who did this to you?

01:26.738 --> 01:28.088
Warriors.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.090
Fierce and quick as lightning.

Gotcha, buddy.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.159
I've never been so glad
to see you, chief.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.205
I'm not the chief
you need to worry about.

01:58.248 --> 01:58.857
Oww!

01:59.641 --> 02:00.816
Keep your heads down!

02:08.345 --> 02:09.694
We're not here to fight.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.174
We're not your enemy. Look.

Unfortunately not.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.944
Yeah, we came about the water.

04:52.988 --> 04:53.641
Doc.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.209
What we came about
was keeping the peace.

04:57.253 --> 04:57.862
Sure.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.430
It always begins
with the word peace.

05:00.778 --> 05:01.692
You know me.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.520
Your father knows me.

The apocalypse changes people.

Yeah, not that much.

05:10.179 --> 05:12.877
Look, what George
started was working.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.966
It was working.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.185
Before the bombing.

05:16.228 --> 05:17.882
But the idea,
that we're stronger together,

05:17.926 --> 05:19.797
can still work.

We'll argue politics later,

05:21.538 --> 05:24.933
Right now, we just want to know
why you shut off the water.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.329
We didn't.

You know, zombies.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.614
Come on.

05:53.657 --> 05:56.268
You want me to help you or not?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.234
There have been attacks.

06:05.713 --> 06:06.757
Zombies?

06:06.801 --> 06:07.454
Old ones.

06:08.759 --> 06:09.978
Long walkers.
They came here from far away.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.240
But they're just a distraction,

06:12.807 --> 06:14.025
trying to divert attention from
more sophisticated sabotage.

06:14.069 --> 06:14.809
Talkers?

06:16.332 --> 06:17.464
Like that saboteur dude
that we were tied up next to.

06:17.507 --> 06:18.813
They're lethal.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.946
We've lost most
of our strongest warriors.

06:21.990 --> 06:22.947
And now,

06:23.861 --> 06:25.385
the whole dam is failing.

06:25.820 --> 06:28.431
It's time for us to go.
We can't stay here.

06:28.475 --> 06:29.998
No. Kuruk, you can't do that.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.521
You control the dam.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.697
You have stewardship
of the water. Finally.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.873
Your people are vital
to Newmerica.

06:35.917 --> 06:36.570
We had a...

06:36.613 --> 06:37.875
Don't say treaty.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.181
We had an agreement.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.705
You father made an agreement.

06:42.271 --> 06:45.056
He's a friend, an ally.

06:45.448 --> 06:46.275
Was.

06:47.711 --> 06:48.799
Was?

06:49.844 --> 06:51.323
Kuruk, is he...?

06:53.717 --> 06:55.110
Up at the powerhouse.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.373
He keeps trying to fix
the damage from the attacks.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.983
But they're coming faster
and faster.

06:59.549 --> 07:00.898
If another one comes

07:00.942 --> 07:03.031
before he fixes the damage
from the last attack,

07:03.074 --> 07:05.076
the whole dam could fail.

07:05.555 --> 07:08.123
And all of us would go with it.

07:14.085 --> 07:16.914
We'll talk to the chief,
he's a reasonable man.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.879
Hey, what was that you called me
back there?

07:25.793 --> 07:28.665
Neeznáá Mííl.
It's Navajo for Ten Thousand.

07:28.709 --> 07:31.886
Well what's Navajo for girl
that just led me in a circle.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.801
I wanted to see
if you trusted me or not.

07:34.366 --> 07:37.021
I thought I could trust you,
and then you led me in a circle.

07:37.065 --> 07:37.761
Too late.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.547
You followed me, so you're cool.
It's done.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.030
Just don't get a big head
about it.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.775
It's looking a lot better.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.995
Were you the one
who bandaged me up?

08:01.219 --> 08:02.525
But you didn't untie me.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.355
It's been a while. I wanted to
make sure you were still you.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.967
Hey, shouldn't you be
back at camp helping pack up?

08:11.360 --> 08:12.056
No.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.057
What I should be doing

08:14.624 --> 08:15.973
is helping the best shot in the
apocalypse so he can help us

08:16.017 --> 08:18.149
not get run off our land
for like the billionth time

08:18.193 --> 08:19.281

08:19.324 --> 08:21.065
Sounds like a fair deal.
Don't you think?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.251
Who are you?
And why are you here?

08:33.295 --> 08:36.080
I'm Georgia St. Claire. This is
Lieutenant Roberta Warren.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.082
We're friends with the chief.
We need to talk to him.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.388
He's busy.

08:39.431 --> 08:41.390
He'll want to hear
what I have to say.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.914
You know our chief?

08:44.175 --> 08:46.003
Then you'll know his name.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.353
He told me to call him Eddy.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.965
Everybody knows that.

08:52.662 --> 08:55.360
Aha-Edohi. That's his name.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.406
He who goes to the water.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.408
Aha-Edohi!

08:59.451 --> 09:02.672
Aha-Edohi!

09:02.716 --> 09:05.893
What's with all this racket?
I'm trying to work here.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.634
Oh, for Great Spirit.

09:07.677 --> 09:11.942
George
Here Why?

09:12.421 --> 09:14.902
No time for that.
What are you doing here?

09:14.945 --> 09:17.252
We came because
the water was cut off.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.210
Kuruk told us about the attacks.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.864
She said
your people are leaving.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.562
That you need to abandon
the dam.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.476
Fear, that's what that is.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.522
The young ones
are afraid of everything.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.829
Zombies, Talkers,
the power of the water.

09:29.090 --> 09:31.048
Pretty healthy fears these days,
don't you think?

09:31.092 --> 09:31.701
Sure.

09:33.355 --> 09:34.443
You have a healthy respect for
the forces that can harm you.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.445
And then you learn
to work with them.

09:36.488 --> 09:37.664
Live with them.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.796
Our ancestors are here.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.406
You mean your Talkers?

09:41.450 --> 09:42.886
Talkers, Zombies.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.367
This was Dakelh ancestral land.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.369
It was flooded
when they built this dam.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.849
Ancestors here.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.677
New generations out there.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.940
I'm not abandoning any of them.

09:53.244 --> 09:57.205
So what, you want to go down
with the ship, er, dam?

09:57.248 --> 09:58.685
Not if I can help it.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.645
These acts of sabotage
have stopped the turbines.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.864
There's too much pressure
building up,

10:05.474 --> 10:06.823
so we have to open the spillway
gates, but there's still time!

10:10.174 --> 10:12.699
If anyone can fix the dam,
he can.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.744
What if he can't?

10:25.712 --> 10:26.713
What do you think?

10:26.756 --> 10:28.323
It's got a lot of sharp edges,

10:28.366 --> 10:31.543
plus a fish scaler, toothpick,
corkscrew?

10:31.587 --> 10:34.198
I'm trying to kill zombies,
not take them out for a picnic.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.157
Fair point.
We need you killing zombies.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.724
You just need the right hand.

10:41.553 --> 10:42.685
I'm not a cook.

10:43.555 --> 10:44.382
No.

10:44.731 --> 10:45.557
Pick me.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.869
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

10:54.784 --> 10:55.872
Wait.

10:58.222 --> 10:58.962
Here.

10:59.006 --> 10:59.920
What is that?

11:00.268 --> 11:01.704
Deer antler.

11:02.357 --> 11:07.971
The deer is known for its
intelligence, energy, and speed.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.887
See how this part hooks out
right here?

11:10.931 --> 11:13.585
A perfect place to put
the barrel of your rifle.

11:13.629 --> 11:14.630
You shoot left handed now?

11:14.674 --> 11:15.283
Yeah.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.199
The antler could also hold
a slingshot.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.549
The tips are pretty sharp,
could be made sharper.

11:20.592 --> 11:21.942
You think I should choose
this hand?

11:21.985 --> 11:22.812
No.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.248
The hand must choose you.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.336
How does that happen?

11:27.208 --> 11:29.819
First, you must strip naked.

11:31.081 --> 11:34.345
Free yourself
of all worldly attachments.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.870
Then you stand in the sun
for a whole day.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.654
And if you're still standing
when night falls,

11:39.786 --> 11:41.701
the hand is yours.

12:03.984 --> 12:04.549
Wait!

12:07.901 --> 12:09.293
Kidding.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.472
You white boys are so gullible.

12:21.958 --> 12:22.959
Hold still.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.540
Working your magic again.

12:38.801 --> 12:39.584
Thanks.

12:44.372 --> 12:47.592
I wish there was something
I could do to help you stay.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.769
I wish there was too.

12:50.465 --> 12:53.337
Maybe there's something
you haven't thought of yet.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.165
You sound like my father.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.037
Did I meet him in Arizona?

12:57.080 --> 12:57.733
No.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.301
He was in Minnesota
when the Apocalypse came.

13:00.997 --> 13:03.521
I only found him
about a year ago.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.393
Now it looks like
I might lose him again.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.138
You know it's kinda strange
to say, but

13:11.660 --> 13:13.705
I kinda miss the simpler times

13:14.054 --> 13:15.577
when we were running away

13:15.620 --> 13:17.144
from plain old fashioned
zombie hordes

13:17.187 --> 13:19.886
and sending them
into the Grand Canyon.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.105
I thought you were
nowhere near the Grand Canyon.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.934
Ha. No, you're right.
That was not us.

13:26.457 --> 13:29.112
But kinda near the Grand Canyon,

13:29.156 --> 13:30.810
I met a pretty special lady.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.464
You'd probably have to ask her,

13:33.508 --> 13:37.120
but it seems like we shared
something kind of spiritual.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.731
We did.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.782
You know, I never thought
I'd see you again.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.828
I lost that necklace
you gave me.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.743
I didn't mean to.
You know, zombies.

13:52.701 --> 13:53.702
But then,

13:55.095 --> 13:56.792
the necklace found me.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.012
It was weird.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.710
Kind of a miracle, really.

14:02.406 --> 14:06.976
And it got me thinking that
if I ever found you again...

14:10.066 --> 14:11.546
We could...

14:11.894 --> 14:12.808
What?

14:13.678 --> 14:16.681
Settle down

14:19.293 --> 14:20.120
Yeah.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.905
A man can dream, right?

14:23.819 --> 14:26.343
And where would we settle
in this dream?

14:26.648 --> 14:28.432
Here seems nice.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.653
It was.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.482
Before the attacks.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.353
And now we don't have
enough warriors

14:36.397 --> 14:37.920
to defend ourselves or the dam.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.008
Let us help you.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.315
This could be
a nice place again.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.186
All of Newmerica can be.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.232
But not if you leave
and let your enemies win.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.799
I'm not letting anyone win.

15:03.815 --> 15:04.860
Wilma!

15:04.904 --> 15:06.557
You have to give Mika a shot!

15:07.863 --> 15:09.604
On three, Shove!

15:09.647 --> 15:10.257
One!

15:10.300 --> 15:10.866
Two!

15:10.910 --> 15:11.780
Three!

15:28.014 --> 15:28.971
Gloria.

15:29.015 --> 15:29.885
Amu.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.017
Hold her!

15:31.060 --> 15:32.583
Help her!

16:01.351 --> 16:03.832
You know what you have to do.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.190
Where do you take them?

16:14.234 --> 16:17.411
Every living thing has its place
and purpose.

16:17.454 --> 16:18.716
Every dead thing too.

16:19.369 --> 16:22.851
Things will get better here,
Kuruk. I promise.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.897
I'm not gonna stay here and
watch our people get wiped out

16:25.941 --> 16:27.943
for some pie in the sky idea.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.858
We have to save ourselves.

16:30.163 --> 16:31.991
Finish gathering your things.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.080
We need to leave
before nightfall.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.039
Will you just leave your father
behind?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.998
Cuz it doesn't look like
he's going anywhere.

16:39.041 --> 16:42.044
Then we're just gonna have to
change his mind.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.399
Good?

16:50.792 --> 16:54.013
Then stop looking at it.
Try it out.

17:04.980 --> 17:05.807
Whoa!

17:06.460 --> 17:07.417
I see him.

17:07.461 --> 17:08.940
Outsider.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.859
What was that for?
I was gonna make that shot.

17:14.903 --> 17:15.773
We need him to talk.

17:16.992 --> 17:17.862
Follow him.
Don't shoot unless you have to.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.168
I'll alert the others.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.355
Tell my father I'm leaving.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.097
If he doesn't come out now,
he might never see me again.

19:53.540 --> 19:54.584
You're leaving?

19:54.889 --> 19:56.107
It's the only way.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.414
May the Great Spirit
watch over your journey.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.068
Dad, please.

20:00.329 --> 20:01.852
Come with us.

20:01.896 --> 20:04.420
Our people have run enough.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.161
I'm not running anymore.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.423
Our place is here.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.163
We can help you.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.686
I know there's a way.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.036
Somebody's trying to stop
Newmerica from coming together.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.603
They're tying to drive us
all apart.

20:13.647 --> 20:17.216
Drive you and your people apart
too, by the looks of things.

20:17.607 --> 20:20.001
Everything you say is true,
George.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.698
But Newmerica is about hope.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.483
My people are choosing fear.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.049
We're choosing to live.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.921
There aren't enough of you.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.792
The only way our people survive

20:28.836 --> 20:31.360
is to come together
with all humans,

20:31.404 --> 20:33.841
all our relatives.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.061
Dad, please.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.240
Not again!

21:25.849 --> 21:27.547
Give up old man!

21:27.590 --> 21:28.635
Never!

22:14.245 --> 22:16.378
What am I supposed to do?
Tie him up?

22:16.422 --> 22:17.640
Drag him out?

22:17.988 --> 22:20.339
Doesn't look like your Talkers
would let you.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.384
He's my elder.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.864
I should be following
his guidance.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.256
Not the other way around.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.520
Okay, so maybe there's a way
we can help him.

22:27.563 --> 22:28.216
Kuruk!

22:31.654 --> 22:33.743
Outsider, a new one.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.528
10K's following him.
He's headed inside.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.225
Okay. We got to find a way in.

22:37.268 --> 22:39.009
We've tried.
Everything's guarded or blocked.

22:39.053 --> 22:41.272
Hey, maybe we should do
like we did before.

22:41.316 --> 22:42.796
A Spirit Walk.

22:46.190 --> 22:49.106
Doc, what happened before
was a fluke.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.108
Or a miracle, like you said.

22:51.152 --> 22:52.371
Well it's worth a try.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.763
I could probably do it again.

22:53.807 --> 22:54.721
Yeah, I think I could.

22:54.764 --> 22:57.071
Wait, Doc. What did you do?

22:57.114 --> 22:58.812
Kuruk gave me some medicine.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.249
And I left my body
and I spirit walked,

23:01.292 --> 23:04.034
and then I killed a zombie
and I saved 10K.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.384
What do you think happened?

23:05.427 --> 23:08.604
We got really stoned,
and Doc had a hallucination.

23:09.126 --> 23:10.389
Yeah, well it worked.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.043
Okay, are you saying
you think you can,

23:13.087 --> 23:15.698
what, separate your
spirit from your body

23:15.742 --> 23:17.526
and get inside the powerhouse
that way?

23:17.570 --> 23:20.050
Well, unless somebody's got
a better idea.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.792
Doc, I want to help.

23:22.836 --> 23:23.837
I do.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.535
If there's anything I can do
to save my dad.

23:26.579 --> 23:29.582
But if you're asking me
if I can make some concoction

23:29.625 --> 23:31.845
so your spirit can go
where your body can't,

23:33.324 --> 23:35.326
my medicine isn't that strong.

23:35.936 --> 23:38.112
Well, what about Ashki?

23:38.155 --> 23:39.200
Who's Ashki?

23:39.548 --> 23:40.767
Our medicine man.

23:40.810 --> 23:41.855
Well where is he?

23:41.898 --> 23:43.378
Sleeping, probably.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.472
Wake up.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.346
I wasn't sleeping.
I was

23:55.956 --> 23:57.000
dreaming.

23:58.393 --> 24:01.309
Grandfather died before he could
finish my training.

24:01.352 --> 24:04.486
How else am I
supposed to talk to him?

24:06.270 --> 24:08.055
Who are these people?

24:11.537 --> 24:12.189
So,

24:13.452 --> 24:16.019
you want me to betray
the lineage of my people

24:16.063 --> 24:19.153
and induct you on a vision quest
that you aren't prepared for

24:19.196 --> 24:20.720
or even entitled to?

24:20.763 --> 24:23.200
And then guide you
through the spirit world

24:23.244 --> 24:25.159
so you can protect the water
for a nation

24:25.202 --> 24:28.075
that just keeps breaking
its treaties with us?

24:28.118 --> 24:29.903
Well when you put it
like that...

24:29.946 --> 24:32.296
What we want is to find a way
into the powerhouse

24:32.340 --> 24:34.473
so Kuruk
can talk to her father.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.300
And you told them
I could do this?

24:36.344 --> 24:39.086
I know it sounds crazy, but
I can't think of another way.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.392
You wouldn't have to bastardize
your rituals.

24:41.436 --> 24:43.786
I mean, last time all it took
was some good peyote.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.354
I don't have peyote.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.749
Look, the old ways never took
account of Zombies and Talkers.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.186
This is a new world
we're living in.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.928
Maybe it's time
for a new ceremony.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.192
Say I do what you want.

24:58.235 --> 24:59.106
What then?

24:59.149 --> 25:00.368
We help you save the dam.

25:00.411 --> 25:01.978
Find out who's behind
the attacks.

25:02.544 --> 25:03.893
We stop them.

25:03.937 --> 25:06.766
Yeah, your people
keep control of the water.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.595
And you believe them?

25:09.638 --> 25:10.900
I do.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.868
Grandfather says
to give it a shot.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.611
But she has to come too.

25:27.003 --> 25:28.004
Why me?

25:28.831 --> 25:30.354
He says he knows you.

25:30.398 --> 25:31.442
From where?

25:31.486 --> 25:33.270
From the spirit world.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.117
Here you go.

25:56.685 --> 25:57.730
All right.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.734
It ain't gonna take you anywhere
you ain't prepared to go.

26:02.517 --> 26:03.518
Promise?

26:04.737 --> 26:06.608
I'll be here the whole time.

26:06.652 --> 26:07.653
Don't worry.

26:14.355 --> 26:15.356
Cheers, guys.

26:21.231 --> 26:21.841
Whoo.

26:50.478 --> 26:51.653
What?

26:51.697 --> 26:53.481
Just in case, you know.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.092
It'll be fine.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.366
Give them a minute.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.944
See? It's all good.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.438
Dad?!

28:03.986 --> 28:04.944
10K?!

28:12.865 --> 28:14.431
Oh, damn. That's right.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.390
I got to do this psychically.

28:17.086 --> 28:19.741
10K! Wake up!

28:22.135 --> 28:25.051
10K! Wake up!

28:29.055 --> 28:30.752
Wake up, man!

28:38.673 --> 28:39.718
Wilma!

28:39.761 --> 28:40.631
Pom!

28:41.110 --> 28:42.764
Where's my father?!

28:42.808 --> 28:44.723
I need to find my father!

28:50.250 --> 28:51.599
Hear me!

28:51.642 --> 28:52.469
See me!

28:52.861 --> 28:53.906
Please.

29:00.303 --> 29:01.609
Something is here.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.221
Wilma, listen.

29:09.269 --> 29:12.620
Aaaaaaa-daaaaaaanv-do.

29:13.621 --> 29:15.014
A-danv-do.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.406
Yes. I'm here.

29:16.450 --> 29:19.061
Spirit, come. This way.

29:28.592 --> 29:31.421
How long are we supposed to
leave them in there?

29:32.248 --> 29:33.684
I dunno.

29:35.686 --> 29:38.385
I've never done this before.

29:56.838 --> 29:57.404
No!

29:57.970 --> 29:59.449
Oh, no you don't.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.249
Warren?

30:17.206 --> 30:18.120
She's not breathing.

30:18.555 --> 30:19.600
Help!

30:20.383 --> 30:22.603
Come on, Warren.
Come back to me.

30:23.647 --> 30:24.866
Give me the paddles.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.440
Okay.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.268
Clear.

30:41.752 --> 30:42.841
Ok.

30:43.319 --> 30:43.842
Clear.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.110
I found the saboteur.

30:51.632 --> 30:52.285
What?

30:52.328 --> 30:53.460
I know how he got in.

30:57.246 --> 30:58.595
Hey, hey, we need to make sure
you're okay.

30:58.639 --> 31:01.207
We need to save the damn dam,
damnit.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.096
Good.

31:21.662 --> 31:22.750
Keep breathing.

31:29.017 --> 31:29.888
Kuruk?

31:30.366 --> 31:31.324
I'm here.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.892
My daughter, is that you?

31:34.805 --> 31:35.719
It's me.

31:36.503 --> 31:38.897
Please, see me.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.290
I'm going now.

31:41.334 --> 31:44.206
I'll see you on the other side
of the river.

31:45.425 --> 31:47.427
Kuruk,
will you sing me,

31:47.470 --> 31:50.473
sing me along the trail?
Will you?

31:51.213 --> 31:52.258
No.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.783
Dad, please.
We need you here.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.917
We need you here.

32:21.852 --> 32:22.853
Kuruk.

32:23.332 --> 32:24.725
There you are.

32:24.768 --> 32:25.639
He's over here!

32:25.944 --> 32:27.206
There you are.

32:27.249 --> 32:28.250
Chief.

32:39.653 --> 32:40.784
Oh no.

32:44.832 --> 32:45.789
Oh.

32:48.662 --> 32:49.445
Oh,

32:50.055 --> 32:51.186
come on!

32:58.628 --> 33:00.065
Wake up!

33:12.555 --> 33:13.774
It worked.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.045
No wait!

33:31.357 --> 33:32.053
Ashki!

33:33.228 --> 33:34.229
I gotta go back!
It's starting to work!

33:34.273 --> 33:36.623
Wait, what happened?
What's going on?

33:37.102 --> 33:38.842
No, Doc! That's too much!

33:39.104 --> 33:40.670
You can't drink that much.

33:41.410 --> 33:44.761
I don't need to spirit walk.
I need to spirit fly!

34:02.388 --> 34:04.216
Here we go, 10K.

34:07.610 --> 34:08.655
Right.

34:08.698 --> 34:09.786
Left.

34:15.183 --> 34:17.446
Up we go.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.841
Oh, there you go.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.061
Okay.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.412
Now...we're...walking.

34:26.455 --> 34:29.023
One more step.
Come on, you got this.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.895
Good, good, we got it.

34:31.939 --> 34:34.246
Grab it. Good, good.

34:34.289 --> 34:35.073
Heave!

34:38.424 --> 34:40.687
Far out. It worked.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.042
I saw it.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.261
This way.

35:05.886 --> 35:07.061
Ch'iidii!

35:16.549 --> 35:19.769
There's to much pressure!
The dam is failing!

35:30.911 --> 35:32.260
Who's there?

35:32.304 --> 35:33.740
The water stopped
then started again!

35:33.783 --> 35:35.350
I'm trying to stop it!

35:35.394 --> 35:36.830
Stop it? You started it!

35:36.873 --> 35:37.700
What?!

35:38.223 --> 35:40.399
Dad! He's not an outsider!

35:40.442 --> 35:41.617
He's George's people!

35:41.661 --> 35:43.228
Kuruk, you made it.

35:43.271 --> 35:45.621
Oh and sorry, Chief.
I guess you didn't.

35:46.753 --> 35:47.623
10K?

35:47.667 --> 35:48.755
Oh no, it's me, Doc.

35:50.322 --> 35:52.280
10K's still unconscious. I'm
just borrowing his extremities.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.717
Oh, to be 20 again.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.067
We can't open the spill gates
from here.

35:57.111 --> 35:59.809
The saboteur must have
gone to the emergency panel.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.869
I've never seen a Talker
kill their own kind before.

36:16.348 --> 36:17.566
This way.

36:37.543 --> 36:38.848
Stop right there!

36:42.156 --> 36:43.157
Who are you?!

36:47.509 --> 36:48.336
He's in here!

37:17.931 --> 37:19.324
You see my daughter, yes?

37:20.281 --> 37:22.152
Take them outside.
Block the exits.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.850
Don't let him escape.

37:23.893 --> 37:26.026
Lever number one, Doc. See it?

37:26.069 --> 37:27.332
Crank it to three.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.207
I feel old.

37:33.686 --> 37:35.296
Kinda stoned.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.472
10K, you're awake!

37:37.777 --> 37:38.560
Doc?

37:39.387 --> 37:40.823
Where are you?

37:40.867 --> 37:44.958
Oh, I...uh, sorry.
I was just...

37:46.742 --> 37:48.614
See you soon kid.

37:51.443 --> 37:52.618
What happened?

37:52.661 --> 37:53.358
Saboteur.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.229
George and Warren are after him.

37:56.535 --> 37:57.231
Hey! Where are you going?
I need your help!

37:57.275 --> 37:58.798
I know. You need my gun.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.236
Tell me who sent you!

39:20.967 --> 39:22.577
We have our warriors back.

39:22.838 --> 39:24.753
We are stronger together.

39:24.797 --> 39:26.973
You brought your Talkers
back into the tribe.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.323
Now we need to do the same.

39:29.628 --> 39:32.195
Ashki had a vision
for a new ceremony.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.850
It's derived from the Ghost
Dance of the 19th century.

39:34.894 --> 39:36.374
It's a dance

39:36.417 --> 39:38.593
that will reunite the living
with the spirits of the dead.

39:38.637 --> 39:40.769

to fight on their behalf,

39:40.813 --> 39:43.206

the white colonists leave.

39:43.250 --> 39:43.816
Sorry.

39:45.426 --> 39:47.210
Oh, no it's cool. I've been
getting a lot of that lately.

39:47.776 --> 39:49.038
Anyway,

39:49.082 --> 39:51.737
it's meant to bring peace,
prosperity, and unity

39:51.780 --> 39:54.087
