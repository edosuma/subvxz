<i>NARRATOR".
High noon at the Astral Avenue branch...</i>

00:13.223 --> 00:17.352
<i>...of Gotham City's Alchemical Bank
and Trust Company...</i>

00:17.519 --> 00:22.815
<i>...a financial institution so conservative
it pays no interest at all.</i>

00:22.982 --> 00:26.986
<i>But while the customers and tellers
transact the business of the</i> day...

00:27.153 --> 00:29.948
<i>...black magical events are brewing...</i>

00:30.114 --> 00:36.120
<i>...for Dr. Cassandra, the evil alchemist,
is about to unleash her terrible swift sword.</i>

00:36.287 --> 00:39.958
- Ready, Cabala?
-Like always, Dr. Cassandra, baby.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.794
Groovy.

00:42.961 --> 00:44.587
Wild.

00:44.754 --> 00:46.881
All right, Cabala.

01:10.572 --> 01:12.490
How can that be?

01:12.657 --> 01:16.494
Twenty-six eyewitnesses
who didn't see a thing?

01:16.661 --> 01:20.915
Ha, ha. Yes, we'll get on it right away.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.711
It's good to have you with me, Chief O'Hara.

01:24.877 --> 01:28.172
After all these years, we've come
to anticipate each other's thoughts.

01:28.339 --> 01:31.175
At times like this, commissioner,
anyone can read your mind.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.511
It's Batman we need, and fast.

01:33.678 --> 01:36.347
Very neatly put, chief.

01:39.559 --> 01:41.019
What's going on here?

01:49.027 --> 01:51.070
- Yes, commissioner?
- Batfink.

01:51.237 --> 01:53.948
Bat--? Who is this speaking?

01:54.115 --> 01:55.158
Dr. Cassandra.

01:55.325 --> 01:58.161
World-famous alchemist,
occult science practitioner...

01:58.328 --> 02:01.539
...and all-around evil-doing swinger.
-Where's the commissioner?

02:01.706 --> 02:04.375
Just zip your lip while
I lay the word on you, Batcat.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.544
<i>I'm gonna put Gotham City in a trance...</i>

02:06.711 --> 02:10.131
...and there's not a thing you
or that junior birdman can do about it.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.845
What's wrong?

02:16.888 --> 02:20.141
There's a new fiend in town, Dick.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.479
To the Batpoles.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.271
I arrived just after
whatever happened happened...

03:48.438 --> 03:52.358
...and applied first-aid techniques,
but they're such stubborn men.

03:52.525 --> 03:55.486
A regular Florence Nightingale she is,
anyway.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.488
It was incredible, Batman.

03:58.489 --> 04:01.993
This mysterious unseen force pounding us.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.621
To coin a phrase,
"there is less here than meets the eye."

04:05.788 --> 04:06.831
Far less.

04:06.998 --> 04:08.332
Begorra, Batman.

04:08.499 --> 04:13.337
That Dr. Whatever-her-name-is
has struck six times in the past three hours.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.173
It's impossible to stop her.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.925
Do you have any description of her
for us to go on?

04:18.468 --> 04:20.303
None, Boy Wonder.

04:20.470 --> 04:23.389
And how can we capture
someone we can't see?

04:23.556 --> 04:25.183
It's all so unbelievable.

04:25.349 --> 04:29.061
There is no such thing as an invisible man
or invisible woman.

04:29.228 --> 04:33.816
Perhaps we've all been intentionally baffled
the way a magician operates.

04:33.983 --> 04:36.110
Now you see it, now you don't.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.987
Holy disappearing act.

04:38.154 --> 04:42.200
Miss Gordon, do you have any volumes
at the Gotham City Public Library...

04:42.366 --> 04:43.785
...on the occult sciences?

04:43.951 --> 04:47.455
- Any number of them, Batman.
-Perhaps we should take a look at them, Robin.

04:47.622 --> 04:51.876
Such a tome might open this door
to the unknown.

04:52.502 --> 04:54.212
Good thinking, Batman.

04:54.378 --> 05:00.051
<i>But you'll need more than books
to vanquish this entrancing foe.</i>

05:09.602 --> 05:11.103
All right, Cabala.

05:11.270 --> 05:14.524
Time for our anti-antidote pill.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.275
Whee.

05:16.776 --> 05:20.238
How do these pills work, doc-y baby?
Are we really invisible?

05:20.404 --> 05:22.990
No, Cabala, but we may as well be.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.951
You see, after taking the pill...

05:25.117 --> 05:29.080
...we blend into the background so perfectly
that no one can see us.

05:29.247 --> 05:33.251
Not even someone else who takes the pill.
That's why we keep bumping into each other.

05:33.417 --> 05:37.004
Well, husbands and wives are supposed
to bump into each other now and then.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.090
Now, Cabala, cut the personal kick.

05:39.257 --> 05:40.424
This is business.

05:40.591 --> 05:44.095
Well, can't we cool business?
We've already stolen $600,000.

05:44.262 --> 05:46.222
Now, now, money isn't everything, honey.

05:46.389 --> 05:49.600
Cabala, money is what makes
my occult world go round.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.937
The power to make other cats do
what I crave them to do.

05:53.104 --> 05:54.272
Dig.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.773
Dug, doc-y baby.

05:55.940 --> 05:57.275
But why the hang-up?

05:57.441 --> 06:01.028
Because I intend to succeed
where my foremothers failed.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.363
Foremothers?

06:02.530 --> 06:06.617
The ancient alchemy has been handed down
for generations through females of my family.

06:06.784 --> 06:09.787
All abject failures, nowheresville.

06:09.954 --> 06:13.958
Just like my family. Couldn't wait for the
depression, they went broke during the boom.

06:14.125 --> 06:18.462
My great grandmother discovered
how to transmute base metals into gold...

06:18.629 --> 06:24.677
...but she cut out
when she added CH3, CH2, H2 and N02.

06:24.844 --> 06:27.096
Put them all together, they spell TNT.

06:27.263 --> 06:29.932
They found pieces of her
as far away as Londinium.

06:30.099 --> 06:31.809
Man, that was a trip.

06:31.976 --> 06:34.312
Now, Grandma perfected
a universal solvent.

06:34.937 --> 06:38.524
Fell in the stuff
and was universally dissolved.

06:38.691 --> 06:40.651
We buried her in a thimble.

06:40.818 --> 06:43.905
Well, how about dear old Mommy-o?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.865
Dear old Mommy-o cashed in...

06:46.032 --> 06:48.743
...when she perfected
a perpetual motion machine...

06:48.910 --> 06:51.829
...tripped and was ground to bits by it.

06:52.163 --> 06:54.790
Man, you sure come
from a long line of winners, baby.

06:54.957 --> 06:59.003
It doesn't hanging me up, love, because I
have a plan that will sway your brain cells.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.212
Lay it on me.

07:00.379 --> 07:04.216
I'm gonna free all the arch-criminals
in the Gotham State Bastille.

07:04.383 --> 07:08.179
Slip them my camouflage pill
and we become an invisible empire...

07:08.346 --> 07:09.805
...with yours truly as queen.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.767
Groovy. Groovy.

07:12.934 --> 07:14.727
We're gonna steal this burg blind.

07:14.894 --> 07:17.229
Wait a minute.
Aren't you forgetting three things?

07:17.396 --> 07:18.439
Like for instance?

07:18.606 --> 07:20.900
Batman, Robin and Batgirl.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.526
No hassle, love.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.029
Not when they face my Alvino-ray gun.

07:25.196 --> 07:27.782
- Alvino-ray gun? What does it do?
-Mm.

07:27.949 --> 07:30.368
Spreads a mess of wild vibrations.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.371
- Oh, mar. Just mar.
-Let's split.

07:35.206 --> 07:37.041
Aha.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.670
Just as I suspected.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.046
What is it, Batman?

07:42.213 --> 07:49.095
This mediquack, Dr. Cassandra,
is none other than Cassandra Spellcraft.

07:49.261 --> 07:55.393
Offspring of the infamous Spellcraft clan,
a group of ne'er-do-well alchemists...

07:55.559 --> 07:59.271
...who couldn't even make the grade
in girls' pharmacy school.

07:59.438 --> 08:02.400
Holy unrefillable prescriptions.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.610
- Is she really a doctor?
-She isn't even a nurse.

08:06.195 --> 08:09.156
- What's that?
-The portable Batphone.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.075
Yes, commissioner?

08:12.284 --> 08:13.744
We'll be right there.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.913
A new development?

08:16.330 --> 08:19.250
Dr. Cassandra has challenged us, Robin.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.544
She's called the commissioner
and announced...

08:21.711 --> 08:25.214
...that she will steal the Mope Diamond
from Spiffany's Jewelry Salon...

08:25.381 --> 08:27.425
...at precisely 2:00.

08:27.967 --> 08:31.929
That gives us 20 minutes to thwart her.

08:32.096 --> 08:33.556
Let's go, Robin.

08:35.433 --> 08:39.270
<i>NARRATOR". While in Spiffany's
jeopardized jewelry salon...</i>

08:39.437 --> 08:44.232
<i>...on Gotham City's fashionable
15th Avenue...</i>

08:50.906 --> 08:52.783
Welcome to Spiffany's, folks.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.285
I'm G. David Schine.

08:54.452 --> 08:55.870
May I serve you today?

08:56.037 --> 08:57.538
Oh, just browsing, Dan.

08:57.705 --> 09:01.125
One does not browse at Spiffany's, madam.

09:01.292 --> 09:03.961
One either buys or one leaves.

09:04.128 --> 09:07.048
Shall I deck him, doc-y baby?
He's trying to put us down.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.257
Cool it, love.

09:08.424 --> 09:10.551
- We don't wanna blow the scene. Heh.
-Ah.

09:10.926 --> 09:15.723
Listen, Dan, tell me, how much are you asking
for the big rock there?

09:16.265 --> 09:20.436
What you call a rock, madam,
is the Mope Diamond...

09:20.603 --> 09:22.897
...and is not for sale at any price.

09:23.064 --> 09:24.565
Not for sale?

09:24.732 --> 09:26.817
Then I guess we'll just have to kipe it.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.320
Cabala, do your thing.

09:29.487 --> 09:31.655
You'll do no such thing, Dr. Cassandra.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.324
Oh, Batman.

09:33.491 --> 09:35.659
I see you've decided to take a crack at us.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.162
- But I've got your number.
-And what about me?

09:38.329 --> 09:39.747
Do you have my number too?

09:39.914 --> 09:43.167
Other women's numbers don't interest me,
Batgirl.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.337
Glad to have you flanking us, Batgirl.

09:46.504 --> 09:48.339
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

09:48.506 --> 09:49.673
Looks like it's pill time.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.883
Keep your cool, love.

09:51.050 --> 09:55.846
The Tiresome Trio are about to really rock.
Ha, ha.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.598
A gun?

09:58.432 --> 10:02.103
Aren't you a little above that sort of thing,
Dr. Cassandra?

10:02.269 --> 10:04.688
No style.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.650
This is the kickiest weapon you ever dug,
Batman.

10:07.817 --> 10:10.694
My own unpatented Alvino-ray gun.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.947
And it's the last thing you're about to see.

10:24.834 --> 10:28.879
What are you doing to our bodies?

10:29.046 --> 10:31.715
Doc-y baby, you are super-psychedelic.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.553
Holy helplessness.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.763
I feel like I'm getting flat.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.098
What a pity.

10:39.265 --> 10:41.267
That's exactly what's happening, Batgirl.

10:41.433 --> 10:45.104
This gun is altering the structure
of your molecular cells...

10:45.271 --> 10:47.273
...and revving your third dimensions.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.281
Stack them up, love,
while I grab the diamond.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.074
Go, baby.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.534
Just a moment, madam.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.953
Attacking the Terrific Trio is one thing.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.914
That's not my business
and I don't wanna get involved.

11:04.081 --> 11:07.418
But stealing the Mope Diamond
is another matter completely.

11:07.585 --> 11:11.964
Dan, how would you like
to get mailed home? COD?

11:12.131 --> 11:15.676
Would you like the diamond gift-wrapped,
madam?

11:16.552 --> 11:17.803
Mm-hm.

11:19.722 --> 11:22.057
We should have heard from them by now.
I'm worried.

11:22.224 --> 11:26.103
I'm sure there's nothing wrong, commissioner.
Batman's never failed us yet.

11:26.270 --> 11:30.399
A Batfight seldom takes more than 40 seconds
and they're already half an hour late.

11:30.566 --> 11:34.612
Oh, they should be coming through that door
right now.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.782
Oh, it must be some sort of prank.

11:46.916 --> 11:49.251
I can't believe my eyes, commissioner.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.795
- But I must believe what I feel...
-Yup.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.423
...and I feel their pulse.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.642
We've had six medical opinions
and each one confirms the one before.

12:04.808 --> 12:07.353
You know how those doctors stick together,
commissioner.

12:07.519 --> 12:12.066
Nevertheless, the fact remains that
there is no known medical way to restore them.

12:12.233 --> 12:15.611
So all we can do
is make them as comfortable as possible...

12:15.778 --> 12:20.324
...while they live out
their sightless soundless, selfless...

12:20.491 --> 12:23.911
...well-flattened lives.

12:24.328 --> 12:25.955
- What about the voice?
- What voice?

12:26.121 --> 12:30.417
The voice that answers the Batphone
every now and then and asks us to hold on.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.461
Maybe he can help us, whoever he is.

12:32.628 --> 12:36.006
It's worth a try. Anything's worth a try now.

12:41.387 --> 12:44.473
I'm afraid he's not here, commissioner.
But I--

12:44.765 --> 12:46.475
What?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.852
Oh, my word.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.815
That-- That is a bit of a sticky wicket,
if I may say so.

12:52.982 --> 12:55.234
Hmm? Mm-hm.

12:55.401 --> 12:58.570
All right, have them sent
care of general delivery...

12:58.737 --> 13:01.448
...to the main Gotham City Post Office...

13:01.615 --> 13:03.742
...and I'll see what I can do.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.873
Here's your Alvino-ray gun, doc-y baby.

13:10.291 --> 13:13.627
- Now what?
-Cabala, I've told you, cool the personal kick...

13:13.794 --> 13:16.964
...whenever alchemy and occult sciences
are involved.

13:17.131 --> 13:18.924
And they're involved right now.

13:19.091 --> 13:22.553
But with all the loot we've grabbed,
the Mope Diamond in our possession...

13:22.720 --> 13:25.222
...and Troublesome Trio
hot off the press as it were--

13:25.389 --> 13:28.684
It's not enough.
I want Gotham City on its knees.

13:28.851 --> 13:32.479
My foremothers couldn't do it,
but I'm going to beat this town.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.774
- Beat it, baby. We'll flail it together.
-Ha, ha.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.069
Look at them, six tiny pills.

13:39.236 --> 13:43.240
And six unseen arch-criminals
about to wreak untold havoc.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.743
The thought of it blows my mind.

13:47.411 --> 13:50.456
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, at the Gotham City Post Office...</i>

13:50.622 --> 13:54.209
<i>...trusty Alfred,
disguised as a doddering dodo...</i>

13:54.376 --> 13:58.589
<i>...accepts delivery of the human parcel post.</i>

14:01.800 --> 14:04.178
<i>While at Gotham State Prison...</i>

14:04.345 --> 14:08.932
<i>...Dr. Cassandra is up
to some special delivery of her own.</i>

14:12.811 --> 14:15.105
- What's going on here, captain?
-Beats me, warden.

14:15.272 --> 14:18.609
All the electric eye alarms went off
like somebody walked through...

14:18.776 --> 14:20.277
...and my men never saw a thing.

14:20.444 --> 14:23.697
- Are the prisoners in their cells?
-Like the day they were brought in.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.866
What about the special arch-criminal wing?

14:26.033 --> 14:27.743
Same thing.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.206
Must have been--

14:33.624 --> 14:35.125
It must have been a short circuit.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.795
Ha, ha. Guess again, squareball.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.254
Who are you?

14:39.421 --> 14:41.465
How did you get in here? Get out.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.008
My name is Dr. Cassandra.

14:43.175 --> 14:46.303
I walked through the front door
and I'm not walking out.

14:46.470 --> 14:49.264
- Keep them covered with this, Cabala.
-Right, doc-y baby.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.308
While I speak to my friends.

14:51.475 --> 14:52.851
Over there, man.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.145
What kind of gun is that?

14:55.312 --> 14:57.981
This is the doctor's Alvino-ray gun, man.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.692
Now, don't move,
or you're both flat as flounders.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.236
Hello, darlings.

15:02.403 --> 15:04.321
This is your leader speaking.

15:04.488 --> 15:10.411
<i>In 10 seconds I shall pull the switch
that will release all the arch-criminals.</i>

15:10.577 --> 15:13.956
Oh. I'm sorry I can't do the same
for the rest of you boys.

15:14.123 --> 15:16.041
But too many crooks spoil the broth.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.710
You know how it is.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.212
All right.

15:20.379 --> 15:22.131
Ready.

15:23.215 --> 15:26.844
Ten, nine, eight...

15:27.010 --> 15:29.888
...seven, six...
-Wild beat.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.515
...five...

15:31.682 --> 15:34.309
<i>- ...four, three...
- Go, baby.</i>

15:34.476 --> 15:37.020
...two, one.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.189
- Blast out.
-Whoo!

15:41.525 --> 15:45.821
Ha, ha. Darlings, meet me at the front gate.

15:55.622 --> 16:00.544
I do hope I didn't get my transistors switched,
sir, miss.

16:00.711 --> 16:07.468
Either you come out three-dimensional
or no-dimensional.

16:09.386 --> 16:12.055
Well, here it goes.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.230
All right.

16:20.397 --> 16:24.026
I'd best get the Batmobile back,
wherever it may be.

16:26.069 --> 16:32.618
And take my departure
before Batgirl recognizes me.

16:58.936 --> 17:01.563
Where are we? What happened?

17:01.730 --> 17:03.273
This is the Batcave, Batgirl.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.608
Holy giveaways.

17:04.775 --> 17:07.152
Not exactly, Robin.
She may know that this is the Batcave...

17:08.529 --> 17:10.614
...but she doesn't know
where the Batcave is located.

17:10.781 --> 17:11.865
It's very impressive.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.116
And functional.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.452
But how do you suppose we got here...

17:15.618 --> 17:19.414
...and who changed us back
to our normal shapes and sizes?

17:19.580 --> 17:23.335
I have my own suspicions, Batgirl,
which I don't think I should disclose.

17:23.502 --> 17:25.087
Of course, Robin, I understand.

17:25.253 --> 17:27.631
We'll get on it right away, commissioner.

17:28.423 --> 17:33.303
Dr. Cassandra has engineered...

17:33.470 --> 17:35.764
...an incredible mass escape...

17:36.348 --> 17:38.517
...of all of Gotham City's arch-criminals.

17:38.684 --> 17:40.435
Holy catastrophe!

17:40.602 --> 17:41.645
How do we stop them?

17:41.937 --> 17:43.313
We have to find them first.

17:44.106 --> 17:48.443
Which calls for the Special Escaped
Archcriminal Bat-locator in the Batcomputer.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.195
Good thinking, Robin.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.742
That must come in quite handy.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.495
Quite. Every crime fighter should have one.

18:02.249 --> 18:06.253
According to this, they should all be in the
basement of Mortar and Pestle Building...

18:06.420 --> 18:08.505
...on Abracadabra Alley.

18:08.672 --> 18:09.881
But how can we get there?

18:10.048 --> 18:12.843
Isn't the Batmobile still parked
in front of Spiffany's Jewelry--?

18:15.178 --> 18:17.306
Look. Here it comes now.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.393
Now, how in the world
did you manage that?

18:21.560 --> 18:24.980
There's no time for that now, Batgirl.
To the alley.

18:35.657 --> 18:39.244
I'm afraid I'll have to put you to sleep
until we reach the city, Batgirl.

18:39.411 --> 18:43.373
- To sleep?
-So you won't learn the location of the Batcave.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.751
All right, Batman.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.961
Guard your face, Robin.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.677
You know something, Batman.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.179
What's that, Robin?

18:57.346 --> 19:00.307
She looks very pretty when she's asleep.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.517
I thought you might eventually notice that.

19:02.684 --> 19:08.732
That single statement indicates to me the first
oncoming thrust of manhood, old churn.

19:12.736 --> 19:17.407
All right, darlings,
here's how we divvy up the territory.

19:17.574 --> 19:21.203
Catwoman gets all the fish market areas.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.997
Egghead, poultry farms.

19:24.164 --> 19:27.084
- Penguin, ponds and park.
- Hwah, hwah.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.586
Heh. King Tut, museums.

19:29.753 --> 19:33.757
Riddler and Joker, all the amusement parks.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.886
Don't forget to tell them
how we out up the loot, doc-y baby.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.346
Oh, yes.

19:39.513 --> 19:43.475
Well, darlings, we get 50 percent
of everything you steal.

19:43.892 --> 19:49.064
But in return, I provide camouflage pills
and protection.

19:49.231 --> 19:53.360
And don't worry
about Batman, Robin or Batgirl.

19:53.527 --> 19:56.446
They've made their last scene. Ha, ha.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.658
Here are your pills, darlings.

19:59.825 --> 20:01.159
Pass them around, love.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.494
One to a customer.

20:02.661 --> 20:05.330
With pleasure, doc-y baby.

20:05.497 --> 20:10.419
Now, you'll blend into the background
for eight hours.

20:10.585 --> 20:15.757
After that, come back with the loot
and I'll give you all another dose.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.468
But be careful.

20:18.635 --> 20:22.806
Don't get knocked unconscious
or you'll all materialize again.

20:22.973 --> 20:26.143
You foolish, foolish woman.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.854
Quick, swallow the pills.

20:32.816 --> 20:34.526
They're gone.

20:34.985 --> 20:38.113
Well, how can we fight them
if we can't see them?

20:38.280 --> 20:42.117
We may not be able to see them,
but I have the feeling they're still here.

21:39.508 --> 21:41.051
We're outnumbered eight-to-three.

21:41.218 --> 21:43.845
It's not the odds, Robin, it's the atmosphere.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.096
Wait a minute.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.849
They'd be in the same boat
if they couldn't see us.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.226
You're right.

22:25.470 --> 22:28.807
Groovy party, baby. Groovy.

22:28.974 --> 22:30.600
Something must have gone wrong.

22:30.767 --> 22:34.479
Alchemy is a highly-specialized
chemical science, Dr. Cassandra.

22:34.646 --> 22:36.273
Sometimes even experts go wrong.

22:36.439 --> 22:42.112
And obviously something went wrong
with your last batch of camouflage pills.

22:42.279 --> 22:45.991
Oh, you goofed, doc-y baby.
The family curse again.

22:46.157 --> 22:49.286
Well, nothing's gone wrong
with my flattening Alvino-ray gun.

22:49.452 --> 22:50.954
It won't work, Dr. Cassandra.

22:51.121 --> 22:55.834
I took the precaution of inserting
an anti-Alvino-ray Bat Disintegrator...

22:56.001 --> 22:58.461
...in my utility belt.

22:58.962 --> 23:04.801
Batgirl, telephone Commissioner Gordon and
his men in blue. Tell him to come over here.

23:04.968 --> 23:09.139
Robin, round up the rest
of these artless arch-criminals.

23:19.399 --> 23:22.986
Commissioner, you don't suppose
Dr. Cassandra and Cabala...

23:23.153 --> 23:25.488
...could pop their way
out of Gotham State Prison?

23:25.655 --> 23:28.158
Not the way Warden Crichton pops them in,
Chief O'Hara.

23:28.325 --> 23:31.411
But if she manages to smuggle
one of her camouflage pills.

23:31.578 --> 23:35.916
The prison matron isn't named Mrs. Frisk
for nothing, Chief O'Hara.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.419
Besides, the warden had
special polka dot cells painted for them.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.297
They won't blend into that background.

23:42.464 --> 23:47.677
Say, my, my, this is certainly a fancy spa.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.429
What did I tell you, commissioner?

23:49.596 --> 23:54.392
Wait till you try one of Minerva's
eggplant jelly vitamin scalp massages.

23:54.559 --> 23:56.519
- Uh, eggplant jelly?
-Mm-hm.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.355
That's right, boys.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.941
Just register.

24:03.193 --> 24:05.862
Check your valuables.

24:06.404 --> 24:11.743
And after treatment in my mineral spa,
you'll feel like new men.

24:12.243 --> 24:15.538
- I certainly feel like a new man.
-Thank you.

24:15.705 --> 24:20.085
<i>NARRATOR". Commissioner Gordon and
Chief O'Hara will indeed feel like new men...</i>

24:20.251 --> 24:25.840
<i>...after a treatment in Minerva's Mineral Spa
for Minerva's treatment has many surprises.</i>

24:26.007 --> 24:32.055
<i>One, a startling device for relieving
Gotham City's millionaires of all their millions...</i>

24:32.222 --> 24:35.517
<i>...as you will see in our next episode.</i>
