WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:07.710
<i>The best of Krypton
lies within the blood of the Els.</i>

00:07.880 --> 00:10.030
<i>Brainiac is gone
and so is our son.</i>

00:10.200 --> 00:13.900
<i>I will raze the universe
before giving up on Jor.</i>

00:14.360 --> 00:15.390
<i>The Black Mercy,</i>

00:15.560 --> 00:16.990
<i>it creates
an alternate reality</i>

00:17.200 --> 00:17.910
<i>in the mind of its host.</i>

00:18.640 --> 00:20.790
<i>My son, he created a clone.</i>

00:20.960 --> 00:23.750
<i>Somatically Reconditioned her
to his ideology.</i>

00:24.160 --> 00:25.380
General Zod deceived you.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.910
Sagitari Thur,

00:27.040 --> 00:29.230
he is not worthy
of your loyalty.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.790
How may we serve?

00:30.960 --> 00:34.710
<i>The colonization of
alien planets is our future.</i>

00:35.080 --> 00:35.870
Kneel.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.270
<i>There will not be a soul left
on Wegthor.</i>

00:38.920 --> 00:40.140
<i>We have to
get off this moon.</i>

00:40.320 --> 00:41.540
Get all of our troops

00:41.720 --> 00:43.470
<i>and every civilian available
onto that ship.</i>

00:45.720 --> 00:47.630
I can't--I can't
feel my legs.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.710
<i>If I don't stop Doomsday,
countless people will die.</i>

00:52.880 --> 00:54.950
You can't save everyone, Seg.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.350
<i>Others have to step up.</i>

01:02.960 --> 01:04.099
<i>It's the Stellarium!</i>

01:04.280 --> 01:06.030
Seg and Kem must've managed
to detonate it.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.470
<i>Now we've got
to get out of here.</i>

01:07.640 --> 01:08.550
<i>Where's Seg?</i>

01:21.640 --> 01:23.350
<i>General, engines
are primed for jump speed.</i>

01:23.560 --> 01:24.550
<i>Awaiting your instructions.</i>

01:24.720 --> 01:26.510
Set a course, Captain,
for sector 2814

01:26.680 --> 01:28.030
and its Sol System.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.670
Which of its worlds
should we target first?

01:36.720 --> 01:37.830
Send word to the fleet

01:38.000 --> 01:40.430
to prepare for the conquest
of Earth.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.110
Initiate interstellar jump.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.630
The people of Kandor
are concerned.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.710
Our Sagitari on the ground are
reporting unrest and...fear.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.110
They are looking for answers.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.600
They want to know
how this could happ--

02:11.760 --> 02:13.350
Where are
the surviving Rebels now?

02:14.160 --> 02:15.110
Not sure.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.780
We've been unable to reach them
since we lost Wegthor.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.830
And the Stellarium?
Is it salvageable?

02:20.400 --> 02:23.150
Is there at least enough
to fuel the interstellar fleet?

02:23.320 --> 02:25.390
Open my communication line.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.110
Val-El.
You survived.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.230
- I'm not the only one.
- <i>Good,</i>

02:33.400 --> 02:34.990
because I intend to savor

02:35.160 --> 02:37.990
the eradication
of every last Rebel.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.300
<i>Enough!</i>

02:39.480 --> 02:41.470
Your time to talk is done, Dru.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.390
No more threats.
No more deals.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.590
Give yourself up now

02:46.760 --> 02:50.540
<i>or we will come for you
and we will end your reign.</i>

02:50.720 --> 02:51.910
You can't be serious.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.950
Your willingness
to weaponize Doomsday

02:54.120 --> 02:57.190
against your fellow Kryptonians
proved, with finality,

02:57.400 --> 02:58.590
what you truly are.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.510
What I truly am
is Krypton's last chance

03:01.680 --> 03:03.670
at sustaining
our civilization.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.190
<i>You're delusional!</i>

03:05.400 --> 03:08.190
<i>You will never be
Krypton's savior, Dru,</i>

03:08.360 --> 03:11.230
<i>because you are already
its undoing.</i>

03:11.400 --> 03:15.280
<i>I suggest you land my ship
swiftly and hide well</i>

03:15.440 --> 03:19.550
<i>because I intend to use every
resource, every Sagitari,</i>

03:19.760 --> 03:23.540
and weapon on Krypton
to hunt your Rebellion down.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.350
We welcome the attempt.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.590
<i>Asshole.</i>

03:40.160 --> 03:41.070
Ow!

03:42.200 --> 03:44.550
You couldn't have done that
in the half I can't feel?

03:48.520 --> 03:50.980
Oh, shit...

03:51.160 --> 03:52.550
How are you doing?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.710
Well, these Kryptonian
sedatives are a party,

03:55.920 --> 03:58.560
so that's one perk
of being paralyzed.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.230
Never walk again,
but I think I can see sound.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.750
You will walk again, Adam.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.680
Val's not gonna stop
until he finds a way.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.110
There was a time

04:10.280 --> 04:13.030
I would've gone back,
damn, with this

04:13.200 --> 04:16.709
and hit the undo button
on what happened to me.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.510
You still could.

04:19.079 --> 04:22.670
No, this little dick-puncher
comes with consequences.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.550
The universe-ending kind.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.430
How did you get that?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.350
It was given to me by
this inventor named Sardath.

04:29.520 --> 04:33.110
You know, dude's so smart
he could tutor Val.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.630
I mean, there is nothing about
space-time he doesn't know.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.030
So where is Sardath now?

04:39.200 --> 04:42.900
My guess he's on
his home planet of Rann.

04:43.320 --> 04:47.020
Hell of a planet.
Unparalleled technology.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.350
It was kind of the Zeta-Beam's
default destination,

04:49.520 --> 04:51.310
so I got to know it
pretty well...

04:52.760 --> 04:54.870
and his daughter, Alanna.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.950
That was a long time ago, so...

04:58.120 --> 04:59.390
Maybe Sardath could help you

04:59.560 --> 05:00.750
travel through time
without disrupting--

05:01.760 --> 05:03.870
Sardath's not gonna help me
do anything, okay?

05:04.160 --> 05:06.390
He kind of, um,
forbade the Zeta-Beam

05:06.560 --> 05:08.230
from ever being equipped
for time travel.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.670
Didn't want someone
just bouncing around

05:09.840 --> 05:11.350
through time willy-nilly.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.870
Wait, you modified that thing
for time travel.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.070
It was a slight tweak.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.990
I just slipped it
into the settings.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.230
But I'm done with Rann
and through meddling with time

05:22.400 --> 05:24.910
and I've caused enough damage.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.390
I have to live with
my choices now.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.710
I understand...

05:31.480 --> 05:34.430
more than you know, Adam.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.910
Thought you didn't like
to drink?

05:49.400 --> 05:51.630
I've never seen a day
that warranted it

05:51.800 --> 05:53.230
until this one.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.630
To those we've lost.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.630
And those we've found.

06:15.200 --> 06:19.230
If Seg, Val, Nyssa
are all really dead...

06:20.320 --> 06:23.230
the three of us are
the last of the Resistance.

06:24.320 --> 06:27.830
If anyone is going to overthrow
Dru-Zod, it's us.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.230
We nearly did it last time.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.390
- It'd be--
- A suicide mission, Dev.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.760
We just got Lyta back
and we've lost so much already.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.270
We've lost nothing.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.470
Dru-Zod has taken everything
from us

06:42.640 --> 06:45.950
and will keep doing so
unless we act.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.310
There's no one left, Jayna.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.310
Dev...

06:53.200 --> 06:57.030
All we have now
is each other.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.310
I know...

07:19.160 --> 07:21.470
Hey, I just woke up.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.100
It sounded like there were
explosions in the distance

07:24.280 --> 07:27.910
and I saw meteorites
burning in the sky.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.040
Please, someone tell me
what's happened.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.750
Scan again
for any active frequencies.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.590
Hello?

07:54.480 --> 07:56.110
Can anyone hear me?

07:58.880 --> 08:01.520
Look, if there's anyone still
on this frequency,

08:01.680 --> 08:03.510
- this is Seg-El.
- <i>Seg?</i>

08:03.720 --> 08:04.940
- I'm coming in.
- <i>Seg!</i>

08:05.120 --> 08:06.710
- <i>Is that you?</i>
- Grandpa?

08:07.280 --> 08:08.500
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

08:09.720 --> 08:12.790
We got you, Seg.
Where are you?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.420
<i>Well, if this skimmer
doesn't break up on reentry,</i>

08:15.560 --> 08:17.150
I'm headed to the Outlands.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.190
I'll probably set down
somewhere outside New Lurvan.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.790
I'm sending you
my coordinates now.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.550
Locking onto
your coordinates.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.590
We'll meet up with you there.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.630
Oh, my boy, it's great
to hear your voice.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.230
Yours, too.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.070
<i>And Adam and Nyssa?</i>

08:32.280 --> 08:33.309
I'm here.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.669
We're all here, Seg,
because of you and Kem.

08:38.480 --> 08:39.990
Kem's dead.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.789
He didn't make it.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.230
Seg, I'm...

08:51.280 --> 08:52.670
I'm so sorry.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.190
<i>Doomsday ambushed
us in the tunnels.</i>

08:57.200 --> 08:59.760
<i>Kem sacrificed himself
for Krypton.</i>

09:01.000 --> 09:02.950
We were all he had.

09:04.160 --> 09:07.030
Well, then he will
be forever remembered

09:07.200 --> 09:08.870
as part of House El.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.670
<i>Brother to Seg-El.</i>

09:15.000 --> 09:16.430
I...

09:19.560 --> 09:21.510
I'll see you in New Lurvan.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.350
Damn.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.440
Hey.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.070
Nyssa?
Careful with that.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.510
Press the wrong thing

09:47.680 --> 09:49.830
and who knows where
you might end up?

09:54.400 --> 09:57.310
Like Rann,
for instance.

09:57.840 --> 10:01.830
Nyssa, what's going on?

10:03.840 --> 10:06.350
I'm going to find Sardath.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.830
Hey, hey.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.390
No, no, no.
You can't!

10:11.080 --> 10:12.270
Val!

10:12.640 --> 10:13.590
Val!

10:15.520 --> 10:16.790
What's going on?

10:16.960 --> 10:18.430
Wegthor is gone,
and along with it,

10:18.600 --> 10:21.110
so is Krypton's entire
Stellarium supply.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.070
The Zeta-Beam can transport me
across the universe

10:23.240 --> 10:24.910
to wherever Brainiac
has my son.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.230
Nyssa, you don't even know
how to use that thing.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.190
The landing alone can--

10:28.360 --> 10:29.580
You already told me
everything

10:29.760 --> 10:31.110
I need to know about it.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.710
You played me?
Oh, come on!

10:34.880 --> 10:35.830
I had to.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.750
Brainiac is still
out there somewhere

10:37.920 --> 10:39.950
and I cannot rest
until I find him.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.020
I can't wait any longer.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.560
Nyssa, please,
think about what you're doing!

10:43.720 --> 10:45.750
There is no other way, Val.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.470
Tell Seg I'm sorry.

10:50.000 --> 10:50.990
Nyssa.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.120
No!

11:11.000 --> 11:12.670
That wasn't so bad.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.980
All right, Adam,

11:16.120 --> 11:18.030
let's hope you know what
you're talking about.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.430
So all of Wegthor...

11:29.040 --> 11:30.230
is gone?

11:31.680 --> 11:33.670
I'm sorry, Lyta.

11:35.640 --> 11:36.710
No.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.790
Seg's still alive.
I know it.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.110
He and I, we...

11:43.560 --> 11:45.470
we only just found
each other again.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.830
What about the rebels?

12:00.400 --> 12:01.870
Well, then we have
no choice.

12:02.360 --> 12:05.470
We end Dru's reign tonight
once and for all.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.790
It won't be that easy, Lyta.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.350
Even if we find him,
Dru is still your son.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.230
If what you're telling me
is true

12:16.640 --> 12:21.910
and Dru deployed Doomsday
on Wegthor, on Seg...

12:23.960 --> 12:26.910
then he is not my son.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.550
I'm in.

12:30.680 --> 12:34.230
The way I see it, nothing
changes unless we change it.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.670
Then I know
better than anyone

12:38.840 --> 12:40.510
not to stand in your way.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.070
What would you
have us do, Primus?

12:46.440 --> 12:49.150
Dru thinks that we're going
to sit and wait for him.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.960
He doesn't think that we have
the numbers to breach Kandor

12:52.160 --> 12:54.070
and attack head on.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.110
He'd be right.
We don't.

12:56.280 --> 12:59.750
No, but he only knows
what we've lost.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.310
He doesn't know
what we've gained.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.510
Which is what?

13:02.680 --> 13:05.190
Inside support
from the Sagitari.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.070
News that I'm alive
has spread amongst them

13:08.240 --> 13:10.950
thanks to Sagitari Thur
and Pline,

13:11.120 --> 13:13.430
and they have reported
that support for Dru

13:13.640 --> 13:15.670
is wavering in Kandor.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.670
That doesn't guarantee us
access to Zod.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.750
Fort Rozz is locked up
too tight.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.470
I didn't say the plan
was perfect,

13:21.640 --> 13:25.520
but if we can't get to Dru,
then maybe we can lure him out

13:25.720 --> 13:29.030
and then use our Sagitari
to separate

13:29.200 --> 13:31.310
and isolate him
from his loyalists.

13:31.480 --> 13:35.710
The only way we can draw
Zod out is with rebel forces.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.950
How are we gonna fake
an entire army?

13:41.760 --> 13:43.990
I wouldn't worry about that.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.670
Seems our army just arrived.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.070
Seg.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.830
General.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.710
What is it?

14:08.280 --> 14:09.670
The ship containing
Wegthor Rebels

14:09.840 --> 14:11.270
has been located
in the Outlands.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.470
Recon teams
report it abandoned.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.230
We're searching for them now.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.750
Have you any idea
where they've gone?

14:18.960 --> 14:20.470
Storms have
eliminated the tracks,

14:20.640 --> 14:21.780
but our heat scanners
are continuing--

14:22.000 --> 14:23.830
I wasn't speaking to you.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.590
Sagitari Thur,

14:32.680 --> 14:34.310
you heard the Commander.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.430
Your Rebel allies
have arrived

14:37.600 --> 14:41.230
and your traitorous exercise
has been exposed.

14:41.440 --> 14:45.550
Now I will let you
keep your life,

14:45.760 --> 14:49.230
if you tell me where
they have gone.

14:56.040 --> 14:59.070
Tell me where they--

14:59.240 --> 15:01.070
New Lurvan!

15:06.000 --> 15:08.380
Primus-Zod is in New Lurvan.

15:09.240 --> 15:12.510
If the Rebels go anywhere,
it'll be there.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.430
Thank you, Sagitari Thur.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.670
Send your men to New Lurvan.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.390
Kem always did have
to have the last word.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.390
Stupid idiot.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.430
He was a good soldier.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.790
With a kind heart.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.310
He was the best mate
a guy could ask for.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.670
Krypton without him...

16:25.320 --> 16:27.350
is going to laugh a hell
of a lot less.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.430
Here's to you, brother.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.950
We'll never forget you.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.110
Did you see him?

16:57.360 --> 16:58.630
Doomsday.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.620
I saw it.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.349
It tore through Wegthor--
through that stronghold--

17:06.520 --> 17:08.550
like it was made of sand.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.829
I looked into its eyes

17:12.000 --> 17:15.750
and I saw no compassion,
no empathy.

17:16.920 --> 17:20.310
Just rage, hate.

17:22.160 --> 17:26.430
I saw that, too, in Dru,

17:26.599 --> 17:29.590
before he subjected me
to the Black Mercy.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.030
He's lost, Seg.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.070
And we have to
stop him, Lyta,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.030
by any means necessary.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.070
We have a plan.
It's in motion.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.030
But it's going to
take all of us.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.270
Where's Nyssa?

17:49.720 --> 17:51.040
Adam, have you seen Nyssa?

18:29.840 --> 18:31.060
What do you need?

18:32.120 --> 18:33.830
Please let me help you.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.310
Where am I?

18:37.480 --> 18:38.910
Is this Rann?

18:41.480 --> 18:43.150
What are you trying to say?

18:43.320 --> 18:44.750
What's up there?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.310
Okay.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.670
All right.
You're fine.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.150
Hey, uh, Val, Val.
Now, listen.

19:11.040 --> 19:14.470
Come on.
Don't bench me.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.070
Put a blaster in my hand.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.990
Just point me towards
the bad guys, you'll see.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.430
I got plenty of ass-kicking
left in me.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.590
Adam, you've helped enough.

19:23.320 --> 19:26.030
Just give the others time
to devise a strategy

19:26.200 --> 19:29.830
and then--well, then we'll see
how we can best fit you in.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.790
Adam, you really have done
more than enough for us.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.350
I wasn't doing it all for you.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.470
Krypton's my home now, too.

19:46.160 --> 19:49.030
You and Seg,
I mean, damn it,

19:49.200 --> 19:51.030
you may as well be my family.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.670
I mean, you're more of one
than I ever knew anyway.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.550
You know back in Detroit
on Earth,

19:58.480 --> 20:00.670
people didn't stick
around much.

20:01.720 --> 20:06.310
My, uh, my mom,
she died giving birth to me

20:06.520 --> 20:09.550
like it was the goddamn
middle ages or something.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.390
And my pops...

20:13.600 --> 20:15.150
well, he never
let me forget that,

20:15.320 --> 20:18.230
but we didn't have much
in common...

20:19.880 --> 20:21.430
except for baseball.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.070
That's a sport.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.910
Tigers fans for life.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.710
The truth is I didn't think
I'd amount to anything.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.260
Then I met you guys.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.390
And now that Nyssa's legged it
with my Zeta-Beam,

20:38.560 --> 20:40.630
there's precisely jack shit
I can do about it.

20:43.320 --> 20:46.190
I'm kinda stuck here
whether I like it or not.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.470
You put your life
on the line for me.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.590
- Yeah.
- My family.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.550
For all of Krypton.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.870
And I promise you,

21:06.760 --> 21:10.430
I will do everything in
my power to make it up to you.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.990
As you already know,
Zod's forces are hunting us.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.470
The destruction of Wegthor
took out his Stellarium supply.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.750
That was his only way to expand
his war to other worlds.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.390
We've left him bleeding.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.470
If we want to end this,
we need to strike now.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.230
While Zod
was deploying Doomsday,

21:31.400 --> 21:33.510
I was laying groundwork
with a network of dissenters

21:33.680 --> 21:35.230
within Fort Rozz,

21:35.400 --> 21:40.670
Sagitari who are loyal to me
and are tired of Zod's deceit.

21:41.320 --> 21:45.020
With them, we can win.
We can gain access to Zod.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.470
That'll be one of them now.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.710
- <i>Primus!</i>
- Sagitari Pline, what's--

21:53.880 --> 21:55.510
<i>No time.
We've been compromised.</i>

21:55.680 --> 21:57.590
<i>Sagitari Thur
has been captured.</i>

21:57.760 --> 21:59.190
<i>General Zod knows.</i>

21:59.360 --> 22:00.630
- Well, what does he know?
- <i>Everything.</i>

22:00.800 --> 22:03.230
- Get her out of there.
- Pline, lay low.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.790
Find some place to hide
and we can help--

22:06.960 --> 22:08.310
<i>It's too late.</i>

22:10.280 --> 22:11.310
Pline!

22:28.400 --> 22:31.190
If Dru-Zod is going to
bring his war to New Lurvan,

22:32.040 --> 22:33.550
we need to dig in here.

22:34.440 --> 22:38.870
Prepare ourselves
and make an all-out stand.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.630
He'll send
multiple regiments.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.510
They'll outnumber us
five to one

22:42.680 --> 22:44.910
and then they'll pin us down
at the ridge.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.790
We don't know that for sure.
Maybe they--

22:46.960 --> 22:50.430
Yes, we do, Seg, because
that is exactly what I would do

22:50.600 --> 22:53.470
and I taught Dru everything.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.270
Then we take Zod.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.800
Think about it.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.230
He's made
a massive tactical error

23:05.440 --> 23:06.870
sending
this many Sagitari here.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.190
He's isolated himself, which
is exactly what we wanted.

23:10.360 --> 23:12.790
Now Fort Rozz will still be
impenetrable, but Kandor?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.430
Kandor itself will be left
relatively unguarded.

23:15.600 --> 23:19.950
If we can keep Zod's forces
engaged here in New Lurvan...

23:21.160 --> 23:22.790
then I can get to him
in Kandor.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.910
I have to at least try.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.510
It might be our only chance.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.270
We'll need to establish
a perimeter around the Outpost

23:41.440 --> 23:44.990
and take out as many Sagitari
as we can in open field combat.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.350
There are civilians here
we need to keep safe.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.950
Rondor piss!

23:49.120 --> 23:51.150
We don't need protection.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.070
We're in this fight now,
like it or not.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.870
We don't,
but we can't keep hiding

23:57.080 --> 23:59.110
and expect you to fix
everything for us.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.350
Time we did our bit as well.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.710
Would I be right in thinking

24:03.920 --> 24:06.190
you have a stash
of weapons here?

24:08.960 --> 24:11.990
We're going to need them.
All of them.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.070
<i>Zod!</i>

24:32.280 --> 24:33.630
Zod!

24:33.800 --> 24:35.270
Come out here!

24:37.240 --> 24:39.880
Enough Kryptonian blood
has been spilt.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.830
It's time for
this madness to end!

24:44.680 --> 24:46.430
You know who I am.

24:46.920 --> 24:50.190
You all know that Dru-Zod
is my son.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.110
So believe me
when I tell you

24:53.280 --> 24:56.750
that Zod's rule
is built on lies.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.630
He controls you all
through Somatic Reconditioning

25:00.800 --> 25:02.270
and I have proof.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.510
I have seen his
detention centers overflowing

25:05.680 --> 25:08.350
with those who dared
to speak out.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.310
I have seen his barbaric

25:10.480 --> 25:12.670
Somatic Reconditioning
chambers.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.110
He is taking from you

25:16.000 --> 25:18.830
the very thing
that makes you Kryptonian--

25:19.440 --> 25:24.270
your spirit, your will,
your individuality.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.790
<i>Sagitari forces have
reached the perimeter.</i>

25:58.200 --> 25:59.630
Move out!

26:07.360 --> 26:08.350
Let's go!

26:13.400 --> 26:14.270
<i>Stand your ground!</i>

26:19.000 --> 26:21.750
What exactly did you hope
to achieve here?

26:23.280 --> 26:24.670
Hmm?

26:24.880 --> 26:26.910
You thought I'd let you
just walk into the city

26:27.080 --> 26:28.550
that I rebuilt,

26:29.440 --> 26:32.630
stand before these people
I raised up,

26:32.800 --> 26:34.670
and try to tear me down?

26:34.880 --> 26:37.390
These people,
they only follow you

26:37.560 --> 26:40.020
'cause of what you've done
to their minds.

26:40.280 --> 26:41.950
Not through their
own free will.

26:42.160 --> 26:46.830
You think they will believe
you over me, their savior?

26:50.920 --> 26:53.430
It's not me
they have to believe.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.670
I am Primus Lyta-Zod!

27:03.840 --> 27:07.950
The person you saw die
was an impostor,

27:08.160 --> 27:11.430
one General Zod
could bend to his will.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.750
He replaced me because
I refuse to follow him

27:15.920 --> 27:17.910
down his destructive path.

27:18.080 --> 27:22.310
Because I dreamed of
a better future for all of us.

27:25.160 --> 27:31.030
<i>A life free of war and
the endless cycle of violence.</i>

27:31.200 --> 27:33.870
A life where we have
the freedom

27:34.040 --> 27:36.870
<i>to make our own choices.</i>

27:37.000 --> 27:38.630
I have seen what happens

27:38.800 --> 27:41.360
when you enjoy
your freedom of choice.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.710
I have lived that future

27:43.880 --> 27:48.870
and I saw Krypton choose
its own self-destruction.

27:49.040 --> 27:54.110
Every decision I make is
for one singular purpose--

27:54.280 --> 27:56.740
to save Krypton!

27:57.840 --> 28:02.070
The survival of our people is
the only thing that matters.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.350
<i>You're wrong.</i>

28:04.560 --> 28:07.070
There is a difference between
surviving and living

28:07.240 --> 28:10.230
and what you
are offering us, Dru...

28:10.640 --> 28:12.710
it's not good enough.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.390
Arrest these two

28:16.040 --> 28:18.600
and execute anyone who even
thinks about objecting.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.070
Arrest them yourself,
General.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.590
New orders.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.460
Execute Commander Dahl
and then take these two away.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.150
It's over, Dru.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.080
Surrender.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.750
Call off your forces
in New Lurvan.

29:08.920 --> 29:09.870
You've lost your mind

29:10.040 --> 29:12.990
if you think I will kneel
before you or anyone.

29:14.040 --> 29:14.990
Yeah.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.630
I figured you'd say
something like that.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.190
General, would you care
to step outside?

30:14.160 --> 30:15.630
You think you are him?

30:15.800 --> 30:18.070
You think you are
the Man of Steel?

30:18.240 --> 30:20.190
You are no Superman.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.510
You are nothing.

30:24.200 --> 30:27.550
- Seg!
- No, Lyta!

30:32.080 --> 30:33.870
You're right, General.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.190
I'm nobody in particular.

30:37.560 --> 30:41.390
So how does it feel that
you're going to lose it all

30:41.880 --> 30:45.430
to powerless, ordinary old me?

30:45.600 --> 30:47.350
Well, this isn't over.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.080
Well done, Mother.

31:05.240 --> 31:08.070
I'm not your mother.
Not anymore.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.870
- Fire!
- Turret on our flank!

32:13.880 --> 32:18.670
General Zod, it's time
you kneel before Kandor.

32:19.120 --> 32:19.910
Never!

33:13.600 --> 33:14.350
Seg.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.510
Seg, stop.
Seg, Seg, stop!

33:16.720 --> 33:18.430
Come on!
Come on, stop!

33:18.640 --> 33:19.430
Seg!

33:30.680 --> 33:32.150
Call off all forces
from New Lurvan.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.510
All Regiments abort.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.310
I repeat, abort.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.670
New Lurvan is no longer
the enemy.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.590
Fall back!
Fall back!

33:45.240 --> 33:46.510
They are retreating!

34:04.560 --> 34:08.630
He's never gonna stop...ever.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.830
Not even the Phantom Zone
could hold him.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.429
I know, but it doesn't have
to end this way.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.150
We are proud of you, son.

34:31.719 --> 34:33.590
You saved us all.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.800
You saved Krypton.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.989
You're a hero, Dru.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.550
How long can
we keep him like this?

35:04.320 --> 35:06.230
As long as we need to.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.230
As long as it keeps
Krypton safe.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.630
Got to hand it to ya,

35:33.800 --> 35:35.950
I never thought I'd see
the day I'd respect a Zod.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.550
And I never thought
I'd see the day

35:37.720 --> 35:39.110
when I'd be happy
to see your face,

35:39.320 --> 35:40.590
but here we are.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.750
This calls for my best stash!

35:45.440 --> 35:47.270
- There you are.
- Val, you're not celebrating?

35:47.480 --> 35:49.470
No thanks, but I have
good news to report.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.430
We picked up heat signatures
near the impact zone

35:51.600 --> 35:53.190
of a large meteorite cluster.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.270
Is it possible?
More survivors?

35:55.440 --> 35:57.190
Well, we don't know
for sure, but, uh,

35:57.360 --> 35:59.950
Wegthorns are a resourceful
people, so I'm hopeful.

36:00.120 --> 36:01.230
We'll take a look
right away then.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.870
I'll show you
the coordinates.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.670
Oh, finally!

36:54.840 --> 36:56.470
Did you get lost or something?

36:56.640 --> 36:58.830
I thought I was gonna
die alone in here.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.750
What?

37:04.680 --> 37:06.030
Why are you looking at me
like that?

37:06.520 --> 37:08.390
I have something
for you, Adam.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.030
I think you're gonna like it.

37:15.840 --> 37:19.070
Base, we've finished
our sweep.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.800
Perimeter is clear.
Heading back to camp.

37:21.960 --> 37:22.910
Jayna!

37:29.800 --> 37:31.350
It can't be.

37:55.800 --> 37:56.590
Grandpa?

37:56.760 --> 37:59.510
Grandpa.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.350
Grandpa, you all right?

38:05.760 --> 38:07.470
I beg your pardon.

38:07.600 --> 38:08.920
Grandpa,
you're a little drunk?

38:09.080 --> 38:12.780
Well, yes, Seg.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.830
I am drunk.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.590
Uh, but that doesn't mean
that I--I'm not drunk.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.080
Clearly.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.430
Come on, we'll get you inside.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.870
Come on.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.110
There you go.
This way now.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.470
- Hey.
- Hey!

38:31.320 --> 38:32.710
Look at you, Earthman!

38:32.880 --> 38:35.590
Look at this!
Look, hey, Val made me legs!

38:35.720 --> 38:37.510
Hey, uh, braces.
He made me leg braces.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.030
You all right?

38:39.200 --> 38:41.550
Anyway, look.
Hey, I can walk!

38:41.720 --> 38:43.590
It's a goddamn
Christmas miracle.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.510
Anyway, that's beside
the point.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.590
I got a jetpack.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.320
- You know what that means.
- Tell me, Adam.

38:53.480 --> 38:56.350
It means I can fly, bitches!

39:01.280 --> 39:03.390
Val, I still
can't feel my legs!

39:12.280 --> 39:13.500
Classy.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.590
Lobo...

39:27.840 --> 39:29.060
put the weapon down.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.830
Whatever you say, Seagull.

39:38.040 --> 39:38.750
Wow.

39:39.080 --> 39:40.030
I know, right?

39:41.040 --> 39:42.070
Good for you.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.590
Thank you.
Grew it meself.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.870
I did mean
the other weapon.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.830
Oh, yeah.
Of course.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.990
How'd you get to Krypton?
What do you want?

40:00.160 --> 40:04.390
The "how" isn't as important
as the "why."

40:04.520 --> 40:07.710
You see, word on the
interstellar street is--

40:07.880 --> 40:09.990
get a load of this.

40:10.160 --> 40:14.150
The Green Gooch that you were
supposed to deliver to me

40:14.320 --> 40:16.430
back on that shit-stain,
Cullou--

40:16.640 --> 40:17.710
"Colu."

40:18.640 --> 40:20.070
- Colu.
- Excuse me. What?

40:20.600 --> 40:22.070
Planet, it's planet Colu.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.950
- Whatever.
- Sure.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.550
Brainiac, he's still alive.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.190
- Which got me thinking--
- No, we thought we--

40:27.400 --> 40:28.470
see, we thought
we did deliver him--

40:37.320 --> 40:40.110
The Main Man is talking.
Why are you interrupting?

40:40.280 --> 40:42.070
Nobody interrupts the Main Man
when he's talking.

40:42.240 --> 40:45.710
Your job is to stand there,
look pretty, and listen

40:45.880 --> 40:49.790
as I explain how you
are going to help me.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.190
Me help you?

40:51.360 --> 40:53.030
- Yes.
- Why would I help you?

40:53.200 --> 40:54.520
Last time we were
in a room together,

40:54.720 --> 40:56.470
you tried to kill me and Adam.

40:56.680 --> 41:00.830
Come on, Seagull,
that was in the past, man.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.550
I mean,
look at Legs over there.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.430
He's over it.
Ain't you, Legs?

41:12.080 --> 41:13.430
Legs.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.190
And seeing as how you
and Brainiac

41:16.360 --> 41:18.230
had a lovely,
kinky love affair

41:18.400 --> 41:21.230
inside of one another,
you dirty dog...

41:22.160 --> 41:26.350
Maybe, just maybe,
you ain't entirely useless.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.670
You want my help tracking
down Brainiac, don't you?

41:28.880 --> 41:30.310
Let's get this straight.

41:30.480 --> 41:31.870
I don't need nobody's help
tracking down

41:32.040 --> 41:33.790
any mother-fragger
in this universe.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.750
You understand me?

41:35.880 --> 41:38.830
But I am gonna need you
to answer some questions

41:39.040 --> 41:40.710
about your last encounter
with the bastich,

41:40.840 --> 41:42.030
if you know what I mean.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.190
Okay, how about
we make a deal?

41:45.040 --> 41:46.830
I knew you were going
to say that.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.510
You and deals.
Always deals.

41:50.360 --> 41:51.190
What do you want?

41:51.400 --> 41:52.590
Look, I'll tell you
everything I know

41:52.760 --> 41:55.030
about Brainiac
and I'll help you find him

41:56.560 --> 41:58.470
if you help me
bring my son back.

41:58.880 --> 41:59.910
I'm sorry, your son?

42:00.480 --> 42:02.270
- Jor-El.
- Stupid name.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.150
Brainiac took my son.

42:14.880 --> 42:15.830
I don't care.
Why?

42:16.000 --> 42:17.550
Well, he said something
about the blood of House El,

42:17.760 --> 42:19.550
but really I think it's
just 'cause he's an asshole.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.870
- He is an asshole.
- Hmm.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.830
Tell you what,
you lead me to Brainiac,

42:25.400 --> 42:28.750
and I will deliver to you
that ugly little potato

42:29.280 --> 42:31.110
that you call a son
safe and sound

42:31.280 --> 42:33.840
and mostly, I said mostly,
in one piece.

42:38.640 --> 42:39.430
You gonna wash that?

42:39.800 --> 42:40.830
Nope.

42:42.000 --> 42:42.990
Well, shit.

43:07.280 --> 43:10.870
Sleep now, child.

43:11.400 --> 43:14.230
We have a long journey
ahead of us,

43:15.080 --> 43:17.270
but it will be worth it.

43:17.480 --> 43:21.150
For once we reach
our destination,

43:21.680 --> 43:26.620
you will be a god
amongst men...

43:28.840 --> 43:30.390
My son.
