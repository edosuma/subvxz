00:08.981 --> 00:10.714
<i>Previously, on Marvel's</i> Runaways...

00:10.805 --> 00:12.767
- What's going on?
- You didn't make it.

00:12.851 --> 00:14.478
Ultra is still out of your reach.

00:14.562 --> 00:16.042
I booked us a room five minutes away.

00:16.107 --> 00:18.528
I can't do this, Tina. I'm sorry.

00:18.611 --> 00:20.783
<i>I'm ready to start
living my life with you.</i>

00:20.867 --> 00:22.327
- I'm ready to tell Tina.
- I have to make sure

00:22.411 --> 00:24.457
<i>that none of this blows back on Chase.</i>

00:24.540 --> 00:26.335
- Dad!
- Glioblastoma.

00:26.419 --> 00:27.421
- That's a...
- Brain cancer.

00:27.504 --> 00:28.673
I haven't told your mom.

00:28.757 --> 00:30.720
<i>I can beat this thing. I know it.</i>

00:30.803 --> 00:32.680
I just wish I knew more about them.

00:32.765 --> 00:34.728
I would be happy to tell you
more about your mom and dad.

00:34.811 --> 00:36.397
Whatever you want to know.

00:36.481 --> 00:39.236
You are the only other person
that staff will work for.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.697
Why don't you keep it for the night?

00:40.782 --> 00:42.744
<i>- I trust you, Nico.</i>
- Guys?

00:42.827 --> 00:45.540
Chase found a hidden
camera in the library.

00:45.624 --> 00:47.879
The video is being funneled
to your parents' company.

00:47.962 --> 00:48.964
We have to find a way to get it.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.217
It's actual evidence of what

00:50.300 --> 00:52.596
our parents have been doing.

00:56.687 --> 00:58.274
Get out of here. Now.

00:58.358 --> 00:59.736
Cat, I got a live one, but I don't think

00:59.819 --> 01:01.697
he'll last for long. Get PRIDE together.

01:01.782 --> 01:03.702
We need to do the sacrifice now.

01:03.786 --> 01:05.372
<i>It worked. How do you feel?</i>

01:05.455 --> 01:06.792
I feel fantastic!

01:08.378 --> 01:09.798
Like I always do.

01:24.410 --> 01:26.957
The hell kind of place is this?

01:27.040 --> 01:29.169
This used to be my home.

01:29.253 --> 01:31.173
It looks hundreds of years old.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.386
And I know I don't need
to point this out,

01:33.469 --> 01:35.140
but it's underground.

01:36.810 --> 01:39.648
You're in real estate development now.

01:39.733 --> 01:43.949
I thought you'd have more of an
appreciation for its unique features...

01:44.033 --> 01:47.664
and more gratitude for the fact
that I'm giving it to you.

01:51.339 --> 01:53.719
You're giving us three quarters
of an acre in Brentwood?

01:53.802 --> 01:56.307
- Why?
- That basement's gonna come in handy.

01:56.390 --> 01:57.601
What the hell for?

01:57.684 --> 01:59.313
You're gonna be doing things

01:59.396 --> 02:01.525
you don't want your neighbors to hear.

02:13.257 --> 02:15.095
We really have to wear these?

02:15.178 --> 02:18.476
It's a request from Jonah.
He says it's tradition.

02:18.559 --> 02:22.401
Whose? I ain't down with robes,
not even red ones.

02:22.484 --> 02:24.488
Not to mention it's kind
of itchy, right?

02:24.571 --> 02:26.367
This feels like
the first dress rehearsal

02:26.450 --> 02:28.121
of a bad play that
nobody wants to be in.

02:28.204 --> 02:30.375
Like you've ever been in a play, Gene.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.045
Reminds me of an episode of <i>Real Sex.</i>

02:32.129 --> 02:33.423
I didn't know you watched that.

02:33.506 --> 02:34.926
At least Tina gets a wand.

02:35.010 --> 02:36.053
She loves that thing.

02:36.137 --> 02:37.639
She's been sleeping with it.

02:39.268 --> 02:40.938
I'm sorry. I didn't...

02:41.022 --> 02:43.443
Really? What I want to know

02:43.526 --> 02:45.613
is what Victor's gonna do with that box.

02:45.697 --> 02:49.873
Brooks here... is going to get into it.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.764
It's going to be beautiful.

03:07.115 --> 03:09.078
Just follow the light, Brooks...

03:11.040 --> 03:12.710
when it comes for you.

03:12.794 --> 03:14.338
Go with it.

03:14.421 --> 03:17.469
Um, I guess you're supposed
to drink this.

03:17.552 --> 03:18.596
I don't...

03:21.560 --> 03:23.231
Whatever you say, Mrs. Dean.

03:24.901 --> 03:25.903
I'm ready.

03:50.410 --> 03:52.832
So, what was that, like, a magic trick?

03:52.915 --> 03:54.961
- It's not magic.
- Where'd he go?

03:55.044 --> 03:57.382
It's the pure conversion
of matter to energy

03:57.465 --> 04:01.140
in a form that can be absorbed
by the human body.

04:01.223 --> 04:03.102
The math has existed for a while,

04:03.185 --> 04:05.900
but no one's actually done it until now.

04:05.983 --> 04:08.195
What do you mean,
"his energy's been converted"?

04:08.279 --> 04:10.951
- He's dead?
- And we killed him?

04:11.035 --> 04:12.872
It isn't a death.

04:14.709 --> 04:17.297
He lives on in another. Eternal.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.009
- Wait, what?
- Wait a minute.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.471
You brought that kid here knowing
what would happen to him?

04:21.555 --> 04:23.392
Alice and I didn't sign up for this!

04:23.476 --> 04:24.938
Except you did.

04:25.021 --> 04:27.860
You all eagerly accepted Jonah's gifts.

04:27.944 --> 04:30.783
You reaped their enormous
benefits over the years.

04:30.866 --> 04:33.079
You knew he'd ask
for something in return.

04:33.162 --> 04:34.749
Not this! We're not killers.

04:34.832 --> 04:36.460
He asked for help with the project.

04:36.543 --> 04:37.797
This is not a project.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.591
I am calling the police.

04:39.675 --> 04:41.428
I think it's too late for that.

04:49.862 --> 04:52.200
- It's recording.
- Well, turn it off. Erase it.

04:52.284 --> 04:54.246
- That won't make a difference.
- Why?

04:54.329 --> 04:59.381
Because the tape simultaneously
uploaded to the Wizard server.

04:59.464 --> 05:01.552
And that's where it's going to stay.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.932
You willingly went along with this.

05:05.226 --> 05:06.226
Set us all up.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.736
Look, I'm sorry about that kid

05:09.819 --> 05:11.906
who just became eternal or whatever,

05:11.990 --> 05:14.704
but if Jonah will do that
to him, he'll do it to us.

05:14.787 --> 05:16.498
Or our kids.

05:16.582 --> 05:18.962
- So we're...
- Trapped.

05:19.046 --> 05:20.465
We made a deal with the devil.

05:20.548 --> 05:23.304
And the devil will have his due.

05:31.946 --> 05:33.574
What, you don't like the tux?

05:33.657 --> 05:36.246
I just don't see why we have
to change how we do things.

05:36.330 --> 05:37.875
You see PRIDE when you need to,

05:37.958 --> 05:40.213
and you stay out of the spotlight.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.927
Besides, I like having you
all to myself.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.596
Well, that's a very sweet thing to say,

05:44.679 --> 05:46.058
but it's not the truth, is it?

05:46.141 --> 05:47.394
I understand your concern

05:47.477 --> 05:48.855
given what happened with the sacrifice,

05:48.939 --> 05:50.691
but everything's under control now.

05:50.776 --> 05:52.237
This is about your husband Frank.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.656
He always asks so many questions.

05:53.740 --> 05:55.744
Just tell him what we tell
everybody else.

05:55.828 --> 05:58.750
That you're a foreign billionaire
and benefactor of the church

05:58.834 --> 06:00.754
who's never been seen
or heard of before?

06:00.838 --> 06:04.469
Are you trying to tell me
that my cover story is thin?

06:04.553 --> 06:06.557
I thought women liked mystery.

06:08.060 --> 06:09.354
Husbands don't.

06:09.438 --> 06:11.860
We've worked for years to come this far.

06:13.279 --> 06:14.698
It's my party.

06:14.782 --> 06:16.995
Dance moves might be
a little rusty, but...

06:17.078 --> 06:18.957
It's a fundraiser for the school.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.086
Oh, come on.

06:21.170 --> 06:23.758
We both know it's about
a lot more than that.

06:25.344 --> 06:28.977
I'm going. Do you like
my tux or don't you?

06:32.735 --> 06:33.735
Please.

06:34.947 --> 06:36.074
I want you to meet her.

06:36.158 --> 06:38.370
Of course I do.

06:38.454 --> 06:40.208
But it's gotta be the right way.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.545
All right.

06:42.629 --> 06:44.049
You tell me...

06:44.132 --> 06:46.846
what's the right way
to meet my daughter?

07:53.096 --> 07:55.377

<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

08:08.843 --> 08:10.304
Someone's up early.

08:10.388 --> 08:12.183
<i>Yeah, I'm just checking in with you.</i>

08:12.266 --> 08:14.186
<i>Sure you haven't changed
your mind about tonight?</i>

08:16.066 --> 08:17.066
Why would I...?

08:17.110 --> 08:18.612
Because, unfortunately,

08:18.695 --> 08:20.157
the <i>Real Serial Killers of Brentwood</i>

08:20.241 --> 08:21.493
isn't available on iTunes,

08:21.576 --> 08:23.096
only in your mom's private collection,

08:23.122 --> 08:24.875
which is why you are helping me

08:24.959 --> 08:27.588
hack into the Wizard server
at the PRIDE gala tonight.

08:27.672 --> 08:29.342
Can't wait.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.887
You've been right about
everything, Nico.

08:30.971 --> 08:32.432
See you soon.

08:37.191 --> 08:41.323
Mom. Hi. What are you doing in here?

08:41.408 --> 08:43.078
Training begins now.

08:48.297 --> 08:49.340
Let's do it.

08:58.108 --> 09:00.279
Ready?

09:00.362 --> 09:03.703
Picture what you'd like to have
happen, whatever comes to mind.

09:15.769 --> 09:17.063
It worked.

09:17.146 --> 09:19.359
I can't hear you.

09:20.779 --> 09:22.459
You said the first thing
that came to mind.

09:33.178 --> 09:34.556
I'll try not to be offended.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.813
An electrical current just traveled

09:37.896 --> 09:39.524
from your neural pathways into the staff

09:39.607 --> 09:40.651
and made that happen.

09:40.735 --> 09:42.071
Explain it however you want,

09:42.154 --> 09:44.325
but it needed my blood
and it read my mind...

09:44.409 --> 09:45.327
It's just like Wicca.

09:45.411 --> 09:47.081
It is science, Nico.

09:47.164 --> 09:50.881
If by science you mean
high-tech magic, then sure.

09:50.964 --> 09:53.093
You still haven't told me
where it came from.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.722
We made it in the Wizard labs

09:54.805 --> 09:56.683
with some very special technology.

09:57.811 --> 09:59.857
Unparalleled technology.

10:01.318 --> 10:03.447
Not the most pleasant on-off button,

10:03.530 --> 10:08.791
but it was designed
to respond to my DNA alone.

10:10.169 --> 10:12.966
So when I use it, it thinks I'm you.

10:13.050 --> 10:17.558
Apparently, we are more alike
than you'd care to admit.

10:17.642 --> 10:20.189
Thanks for letting me
take it for a spin.

10:20.272 --> 10:22.026
If you wanted to know how it worked,

10:22.109 --> 10:23.445
you could've just asked.

10:23.528 --> 10:25.491
And if you wanted to see Amy's diary,

10:25.574 --> 10:27.788
you could've asked me, too.

10:28.998 --> 10:30.542
Look, don't worry.

10:30.626 --> 10:33.507
Her diary didn't tell me
any more than you did.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.935
You must have a theory.
You guys fought a lot, and...

10:39.018 --> 10:40.730
Of course, we fought all the time

10:40.814 --> 10:42.191
because she was 16 years old

10:42.274 --> 10:43.694
and I was her mother and...

10:43.778 --> 10:45.656
We had our issues, but I didn't once,

10:45.740 --> 10:51.251
for a second, think
that she was going to...

10:51.334 --> 10:52.545
Kill herself?

10:58.432 --> 11:00.436
The truth is...

11:04.527 --> 11:07.158
you never really know what's
going on in someone's mind...

11:08.703 --> 11:09.955
even someone you love.

11:24.777 --> 11:26.989
Hey, sweetie. I'm gonna go
hike the canyon.

11:27.073 --> 11:28.116
You want some fresh air?

11:32.208 --> 11:33.502
What do you got there?

11:33.585 --> 11:34.629
Grandpa's drawings.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.011
Those are pretty wild.

11:38.095 --> 11:40.474
You and Mom always taught me
that the Beings of Light

11:40.557 --> 11:42.813
Grandpa talked about
were just a metaphor.

11:42.896 --> 11:46.152
That's right. The light
inside all of us.

11:46.236 --> 11:47.571
It's our life force.

11:47.655 --> 11:49.659
David believed that if you
studied the spectrum

11:49.743 --> 11:52.456
you could enhance that light,
become something else.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.962
Right, but the way he drew them

11:55.045 --> 11:57.174
becoming light wasn't just an ideal.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.264
It could actually happen.

12:00.347 --> 12:02.643
Do you think he ever saw
something like this?

12:02.727 --> 12:05.900
Something... divine?

12:05.984 --> 12:07.528
I don't know what David saw.

12:09.532 --> 12:11.369
And, truthfully, right now,

12:11.452 --> 12:13.791
I don't even know if I
understand what David wrote.

12:16.004 --> 12:18.550
I don't know if Mom told you,
but I failed to go Ultra.

12:18.633 --> 12:20.889
I wasn't aware you were trying.

12:25.564 --> 12:27.736
Sometimes it takes more
than one trip to the crater.

12:27.819 --> 12:30.449
I think I might be done with that.

12:30.532 --> 12:33.413
Like maybe I was chasing
something that isn't mine.

12:34.498 --> 12:35.835
It isn't me.

12:35.919 --> 12:37.714
I just need a break.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.391
Dad, why aren't you in PRIDE?

12:43.475 --> 12:45.604
All the other parents do it as a couple.

12:45.687 --> 12:47.149
I don't know.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.654
Just always kind of seemed
like your mom's thing.

12:49.738 --> 12:51.282
She seems to have a lot of those.

12:51.366 --> 12:55.249
Yeah. She does.

12:55.332 --> 12:56.710
But, hey, you and me,

12:56.794 --> 12:59.340
we can put the "fun"
in "fundraiser" tonight, okay?

12:59.423 --> 13:01.261
And you can totally use that joke.

13:06.730 --> 13:10.905
Looks a little worse for wear,
but nothing we can't fix.

13:10.989 --> 13:12.867
Must've given them quite a test run.

13:12.951 --> 13:15.707
- Eh, just some target practice.
- And they worked?

13:15.790 --> 13:17.877
- More or less.
- That's great, son,

13:17.961 --> 13:21.009
that a trial run would yield
any success at all.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.804
We must know what we're doing.

13:22.887 --> 13:24.473
Um, I would love to talk more,

13:24.557 --> 13:26.311
but I am meeting up with some friends.

13:26.394 --> 13:27.814
Oh, I'll drive you.

13:27.897 --> 13:29.901
We can continue this meeting
of the minds on the way.

13:29.985 --> 13:31.112
Actually, I'm good.

13:31.195 --> 13:32.824
Oh, I get it, son,

13:32.907 --> 13:35.147
you don't want your friends
seeing you with your old man,

13:35.203 --> 13:36.883
even if he is
the coolest guy in the world.

13:38.168 --> 13:40.464
Hey, <i>Gizmodo</i> said that, not me.

13:40.547 --> 13:42.551
Maybe they're on to something.

13:44.096 --> 13:45.850
I'll see you tonight at the party.

13:57.414 --> 13:59.668
<i>...Jaguar on the side of the road,</i>

13:59.753 --> 14:01.339
<i>or the cougar parked inside!</i>

14:01.422 --> 14:02.508
<i>Really, Robert?</i>

14:02.591 --> 14:04.428
Sorry. I meant it as a compliment.

14:04.512 --> 14:06.349
Of course you did, because you are

14:06.432 --> 14:07.977
the sweetest man I have ever met.

14:08.061 --> 14:09.563
Well, you married Victor Stein.

14:09.647 --> 14:11.609
You're working off
a limited sample size.

14:11.692 --> 14:15.325
True, although lately
Victor's been a different guy.

14:15.408 --> 14:18.707
Nice to me, great with Chase.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.337
Cheating's much harder when your
husband isn't being a dick.

14:21.420 --> 14:24.009
That's why now is when you tell him,

14:24.093 --> 14:26.055
not when he's in a manic phase, or...

14:26.139 --> 14:28.727
<i>- violent.
- I never said he was violent.</i>

14:28.811 --> 14:31.524
<i>You didn't have to. You think
I didn't notice the bruises?</i>

14:31.607 --> 14:33.403
<i>The ones you blamed on the car door?</i>

14:33.486 --> 14:35.031
<i>Walking into the chair?</i>

14:35.115 --> 14:36.284
I know, I'm sorry.

14:36.367 --> 14:38.037
I never meant to keep anything from you.

14:38.121 --> 14:40.751
- I just...
- None of this is your fault.

14:40.835 --> 14:43.047
He's a monster, Janet.

14:43.131 --> 14:44.633
And how do you think he'll react

14:44.718 --> 14:46.095
when I tell him I'm leaving him?

14:49.101 --> 14:51.982
That's why I got this.

14:54.653 --> 14:56.449
That's a little extreme, Robert.

14:56.532 --> 14:58.077
It's just a precaution.

14:58.161 --> 14:59.998
You can't go on living like this.

15:01.584 --> 15:03.630
It's time you tell him about us.

15:17.282 --> 15:19.078
- So, what's the plan?
- Yeah, Alex?

15:19.119 --> 15:20.719
Why does everyone assume Alex
has a plan?

15:20.748 --> 15:21.792
Someone else might have a plan.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.169
Great. Let's hear it.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.300
I just meant hypothetically.

15:26.384 --> 15:30.810
Guys, all I meant is are we
carpooling or going separately,

15:30.893 --> 15:32.493
and how dressed up
is everyone gonna get?

15:32.562 --> 15:34.108
Oh, uh, suit, no tie.

15:34.191 --> 15:36.153
Oh, so <i>that</i> you have a plan for.

15:36.237 --> 15:38.157
Also, my parents are okay
footing the bill for a limo.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.618
- Mine, too.
- Same.

15:39.703 --> 15:41.372
Yeah, my parents have been
really nice these days.

15:41.455 --> 15:44.044
Guys, we cannot have the carbon
footprint of a fleet of limos.

15:44.128 --> 15:47.301
Nico, I could pick you up
if you wanted to go together.

15:47.384 --> 15:49.764
Karolina, I practically go
right past your house.

15:51.475 --> 15:52.895
Some of us are too young to date.

15:52.979 --> 15:54.523
Dating is so heteronormative.

15:54.606 --> 15:56.778
- One limo, five stops.
- Okay.

15:56.862 --> 15:59.909
So, we figured out
the transportation situation.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.456
Everybody cool what happens
once we get there?

16:02.539 --> 16:05.587
Once that video is out,
there's no going back.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.049
Our parents will be put away forever.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.343
And that's a bad thing?

16:08.426 --> 16:10.096
No, but don't you have questions?

16:10.180 --> 16:12.142
Maybe we should try talking to them,

16:12.225 --> 16:13.729
you know, one last time.

16:13.812 --> 16:14.981
I don't know,

16:15.065 --> 16:16.985
I think the time for talking is over.

16:17.069 --> 16:19.615
But everybody's gotta be in.
I know I am.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.343
Chase, put your hand in.

16:29.426 --> 16:31.472
Sorry, I didn't realize
putting my hand in a pile

16:31.555 --> 16:33.434
was some kind of
legally binding contract.

16:33.518 --> 16:37.526
- It's symbolic.
- Yeah, well, of course I'm in.

16:37.609 --> 16:39.196
Who hates their dad more than me?

16:41.700 --> 16:43.162
So, how long do we have to do this?

16:43.246 --> 16:44.289
- Yeah...
- Ugh, it's hot.

17:01.699 --> 17:04.079
- Let me give you a hand.
- I got this. I don't need you.

17:08.337 --> 17:09.631
You're still signed up

17:09.715 --> 17:11.218
for a few more years under my roof.

17:11.301 --> 17:12.722
We ain't gonna make it like this.

17:12.805 --> 17:14.474
You made the problem, not me,

17:14.558 --> 17:15.728
and I'm not gonna fix it

17:15.810 --> 17:17.481
by pretending that nothing's wrong.

17:18.648 --> 17:19.819
I know too much.

17:30.590 --> 17:31.592
<i>Nico?</i>

17:34.348 --> 17:36.937
Where are you going dressed like that?

17:37.020 --> 17:38.941
To Karolina's.

17:39.024 --> 17:41.153
I'm getting ready for the party there.

17:41.237 --> 17:44.702
Oh, I thought maybe you'd changed
your mind and weren't going.

17:44.786 --> 17:46.580
No, I'll be there.

17:48.251 --> 17:50.588
In party shoes. It works with my dress.

17:51.925 --> 17:54.471
You going to meet up with Alex?

17:54.555 --> 17:57.185
Wait, that was... a smile?

17:58.354 --> 17:59.858
Does this mean you like him now?

17:59.941 --> 18:01.652
I might have overreacted

18:01.736 --> 18:03.824
when I found you two together.

18:03.907 --> 18:06.287
Bye, Mom. See you there.

18:06.370 --> 18:07.832
Bye, Dad.

18:14.721 --> 18:17.183
Planning on doing some spells
while Nico's out?

18:20.398 --> 18:21.692
More like...

18:21.776 --> 18:23.906
hoping this darkness is in the past.

18:27.537 --> 18:30.126
Maybe this gala will be
a new start for our family.

19:13.087 --> 19:14.924
Oh, sorry. No, not that one.

19:15.008 --> 19:17.888
Oh, sorry. Yeah.

19:17.972 --> 19:19.474
- It's okay.
- Yeah, sorry.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.645
- It's okay.
- Okay.

19:21.730 --> 19:23.107
Hope that wasn't weird,

19:23.190 --> 19:25.904
like I was trying to make
you glow or something.

19:25.988 --> 19:27.365
Were you?

19:28.744 --> 19:29.829
Maybe.

19:32.835 --> 19:34.546
What I saw you do the other night?

19:35.841 --> 19:39.056
It should never make you feel afraid.

19:40.308 --> 19:41.685
Or ashamed.

19:41.770 --> 19:43.147
It's just...

19:43.230 --> 19:44.649
everything my whole life

19:44.734 --> 19:46.821
has been for my mom and the church.

19:46.905 --> 19:49.534
Then I learned that what I
thought was the ultimate good

19:49.618 --> 19:51.956
is somehow a part
of the worst thing imaginable.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.756
And what if what I do
is connected to that?

19:55.839 --> 19:57.509
What does that make me?

19:57.592 --> 19:58.887
You know who you are.

20:00.974 --> 20:02.770
I know who you are,

20:02.853 --> 20:06.235
and neither of us is our parents,

20:06.318 --> 20:09.784
or the messed-up shit they're doing.

20:09.867 --> 20:13.457
Though nothing is more messed up
than what my mom is doing now,

20:13.541 --> 20:15.921
actually being nice
for the first time in years.

20:16.004 --> 20:18.008
It's funny, you were always the rebel,

20:18.092 --> 20:19.887
and now you're feeling
close to your mom.

20:19.971 --> 20:22.267
I was always the mama's girl, and now...

20:22.350 --> 20:25.106
Oh, now what? You're the rebel?

20:25.189 --> 20:27.318
No, I'm serious!

20:27.402 --> 20:30.116
Gert was right,
I was the perfect church girl.

20:30.199 --> 20:35.001
I never did anything disobedient
or different or what I wanted.

20:35.084 --> 20:39.050
But now that I know
I'm, like, a total freak,

20:39.134 --> 20:40.428
maybe I'm free...

20:41.680 --> 20:42.975
to be who I really am.

20:44.770 --> 20:47.150
And to be...

20:47.233 --> 20:49.154
honest about who I want to be with.

20:54.623 --> 20:56.293
Hi!

20:56.376 --> 20:58.924
Hi! I didn't know you guys were coming.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.092
Nico invited us.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.057
Support your local girl gang, right?

21:03.140 --> 21:04.810
Right.

21:14.747 --> 21:15.999
Cheers, guys.

21:25.101 --> 21:27.021
We're here.

21:52.655 --> 21:55.202
Hey, I think I saw a Kardashian.

21:55.286 --> 21:57.206
Definitely recognized the butt.

21:57.290 --> 21:59.419
The red carpet is
just another commodification

21:59.502 --> 22:01.048
of the so-called beauty industry

22:01.131 --> 22:03.594
and fashion designers
who exploit garment workers

22:03.677 --> 22:05.389
and promote negative body images.

22:05.473 --> 22:07.602
Seriously, you look amazing.

22:07.685 --> 22:09.522
You're impressing everyone here.

22:09.606 --> 22:11.861
I guess one step- and-repeat
wouldn't hurt.

22:11.944 --> 22:13.530
Come on, let's go.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.891
Everybody here thinks
our parents are the heroes.

22:26.974 --> 22:28.394
Not after tonight.

22:29.730 --> 22:31.108
I hope they enjoy it.

22:31.191 --> 22:34.155
It'll be the last fun
they have for a while.

22:34.239 --> 22:37.537
If they go to prison, it'll be
hard to talk to them, right?

22:37.620 --> 22:39.416
I'm not too worried.

23:07.430 --> 23:09.017
What's with you tonight?

23:09.100 --> 23:10.729
You usually live for this.

23:10.812 --> 23:11.812
Yeah, well, I've grown.

23:13.317 --> 23:15.009
They say that you learn
more from your failures

23:15.051 --> 23:17.241
than your successes.

23:17.325 --> 23:19.537
Turns out that's true of action comedies

23:19.621 --> 23:21.834
and religious tests.

23:21.918 --> 23:24.172
I'm sorry you didn't go Ultra, Frank.

23:24.255 --> 23:26.928
I'm not, because I see now.

23:27.011 --> 23:29.432
I see that I need to follow
my own passion,

23:29.516 --> 23:31.269
wherever that takes me.

23:32.563 --> 23:35.277
Leslie, it's so good to see you.

23:38.325 --> 23:41.081
I'm Frank Dean. I'm Leslie's husband.

23:42.458 --> 23:43.627
And I'm Jonah,

23:43.711 --> 23:45.297
long-time member of the church,

23:45.381 --> 23:48.303
and admirer of your wife
from way before that.

23:48.387 --> 23:49.765
Mm-hmm.

23:49.848 --> 23:51.268
Jonah just moved here.

23:51.351 --> 23:53.063
He used to study with my father.

23:53.146 --> 23:55.192
Oh, may his journey
continue into brightness.

23:55.276 --> 23:56.361
What a great man.

23:58.657 --> 24:01.747
Frank, do you mind if I steal your wife?

24:02.833 --> 24:04.712
Just for a moment.

24:04.795 --> 24:06.631
There's somebody
I'd like to meet, and...

24:08.093 --> 24:09.805
I need an introduction.

24:28.634 --> 24:29.634
Frank...

24:31.014 --> 24:32.976
Get out!

24:33.060 --> 24:35.105
<i>Get out, Frank.</i>

24:37.318 --> 24:38.487
Get out.

24:52.556 --> 24:53.558
Okay, it's go time.

24:53.642 --> 24:55.814
Nico, you ready to lead the way?

24:57.525 --> 24:59.654
Karolina, hey, can I talk
to you for a second?

25:01.574 --> 25:03.830
I was just wondering,
are you kind of into Nico?

25:05.917 --> 25:07.237
Just when I walked into the room,

25:07.294 --> 25:08.463
I kind of sensed a vibe.

25:08.547 --> 25:10.342
By the way, I would totally support it.

25:12.304 --> 25:15.060
Yeah. So you could be with Chase?

25:16.604 --> 25:18.943
Excuse me, what? No, I don't like Chase.

25:19.026 --> 25:20.947
- That's crazy.
- Could've fooled me.

25:23.326 --> 25:27.668
Hey, Chase. I'm thirsty.
Should we go get a drink?

25:27.753 --> 25:29.715
Yeah, I'll get in line.

25:29.798 --> 25:30.842
Thanks.

25:35.184 --> 25:36.436
Fine. Enjoy.

25:36.519 --> 25:38.315
But just know you're not being honest

25:38.398 --> 25:39.609
about who you really like.

25:39.692 --> 25:41.989
Well, neither are you.

25:46.247 --> 25:51.216
Okay, we three are
Operation Tina Server Room.

25:51.299 --> 25:53.888
I'm not great at code names.
I'm working on it.

25:53.971 --> 25:55.432
- You ready?
- Born ready.

25:55.516 --> 25:56.727
Let's rock this bitch.

25:59.482 --> 26:01.027
Where's Molly?

26:25.033 --> 26:26.452
...your generous donation

26:26.536 --> 26:28.665
furthering PRIDE's
philanthropic efforts.

26:28.749 --> 26:31.087
- Don't we, Catherine?
- Indeed.

26:32.381 --> 26:34.010
Good to see you.

26:37.266 --> 26:39.855
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

26:41.399 --> 26:42.399
You seen Alex yet?

26:43.528 --> 26:45.490
He's probably avoiding us.

26:50.500 --> 26:51.712
Go get him, Tiger.

26:53.381 --> 26:55.052
We just need a couple of minutes

26:55.135 --> 26:56.346
of quality flirtation.

26:56.429 --> 26:57.556
- That's it.
- That's it.

26:57.640 --> 26:58.976
Right, but how?

26:59.060 --> 27:02.107
Just be yourself.

27:02.191 --> 27:04.070
Come on, Gert. Make it happen.

27:06.867 --> 27:09.706
Cockroaches, right?

27:10.792 --> 27:12.670
No other creature

27:12.754 --> 27:15.592
could better convey
the lows of human existence.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.179
Kafka nailed it.

27:17.262 --> 27:19.141
Agreed, yeah.

27:19.225 --> 27:22.857
It's for a class called The
Dehumanization of the Proletariat.

27:22.941 --> 27:24.443
I have always been fascinated

27:24.527 --> 27:26.489
by the way the Industrial Revolution

27:26.572 --> 27:28.493
contorted the human spirit.

27:29.913 --> 27:32.459
Well, um...

27:32.543 --> 27:34.630
- Did you see Jonah at the carving station?
- I did!

27:34.715 --> 27:36.217
- How weird is that?
- That is weird.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.138
You notice when he gets revved up

27:38.221 --> 27:39.766
he disappears, right?

27:39.850 --> 27:41.854
- Yeah.
- And he travels the world, or...

27:41.937 --> 27:43.440
Whatever he does, I don't know.

27:44.608 --> 27:46.404
You don't think...

27:46.487 --> 27:48.909
after what happened
he doesn't trust us, do you?

27:48.993 --> 27:50.078
Well, would you?

27:50.162 --> 27:51.915
I don't know. Hey! Hi, sweetie.

27:51.999 --> 27:53.919
- You look beautiful!
- Very good.

27:54.003 --> 27:56.340
- You try the bacon-wrapped dates?
- Nah, I'm good.

27:56.424 --> 27:59.180
I don't eat 'em, either. Jewish.

27:59.263 --> 28:01.184
That was close.

28:01.267 --> 28:03.688
Yeah, but we totally covered. Yeah.

28:18.134 --> 28:20.973
Chase, did you come with Karolina?

28:21.057 --> 28:22.518
Waiting for her, actually.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.563
But I'm gonna go look somewhere else,

28:24.647 --> 28:26.484
'cause why would she be here,

28:26.567 --> 28:28.446
standing in line at a bar?

28:56.544 --> 28:57.546
Is that it?

29:02.139 --> 29:05.562
From the other side of the
screen, it all looks so easy.

29:07.316 --> 29:10.907
<i>Tron?</i> It seemed appropriate.

29:10.990 --> 29:13.590
I knew your nerd brain couldn't
handle this much processing power.

29:13.620 --> 29:15.624
There's so many.

29:15.708 --> 29:17.419
How will we figure out
which one we need?

29:17.502 --> 29:19.841
Do you really want to know
how a hypervisor delineates

29:19.925 --> 29:21.929
between a physical server
and a virtual one?

29:22.012 --> 29:24.516
'Cause if you did, that's kind of hot.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.236
Yes!

29:32.574 --> 29:33.574
Okay...

29:36.666 --> 29:38.378
Yes, here we go.

29:39.630 --> 29:43.096
Okay. Plugging in.

29:45.851 --> 29:48.022
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

29:49.525 --> 29:51.405
These ports must work off
an internal interface.

29:51.445 --> 29:52.824
I can't plug in.

29:52.907 --> 29:54.326
That's why there's
no security down here.

29:54.410 --> 29:56.664
Wizard is the security.

29:56.748 --> 29:58.251
What if we were in my mom's office?

29:58.334 --> 29:59.734
Could you get the video from there?

30:20.545 --> 30:23.051
I didn't realize this was BYOB.

30:23.134 --> 30:24.929
Now I see why you ditched downstairs.

30:26.098 --> 30:27.434
I needed to be alone.

30:27.517 --> 30:28.896
I'm not so sure about that.

30:28.979 --> 30:30.398
'Cause everyone knows
what's best for me.

30:30.482 --> 30:32.069
No, because you're drinking well vodka.

30:32.152 --> 30:34.656
You could've at least swiped
a bottle of the good stuff.

30:35.910 --> 30:37.747
Hey, whatever it is, you can tell me.

30:39.625 --> 30:41.087
Not this.

30:41.170 --> 30:42.631
Try me.

30:42.715 --> 30:45.428
- My whole life is a lie.
- Mine too.

30:45.512 --> 30:47.725
No. No, it's not the same.

30:47.809 --> 30:49.603
Your secret is that you're super smart,

30:49.686 --> 30:51.900
not that you light up
like a rainbow glow stick.

30:55.657 --> 30:58.246
Hey, maybe you want
to get away from there?

31:01.418 --> 31:03.339
No, I'm good.

31:05.803 --> 31:08.391
"Out the window at a barren waste

31:08.474 --> 31:10.228
"where the gray sky

31:10.311 --> 31:12.524
and the gray earth mingled inseparably."

31:14.194 --> 31:16.490
He had a way with prose.

31:24.256 --> 31:26.135
Excuse me, it's just...

31:31.604 --> 31:34.318
Hey, it's Earl. Did you guys just...

31:34.401 --> 31:36.781
<i>- Use the Force, Luke.</i>
- I'll call you right back.

31:36.865 --> 31:38.367
Uh, no, no.

31:38.451 --> 31:39.954
You shouldn't be playing with that.

31:40.038 --> 31:42.292
Oh, weird. See, I was
under the impression

31:42.375 --> 31:44.338
that games were meant to be played.

31:54.524 --> 31:56.487
You've gotta be kidding me right now.
It's not working!

31:56.570 --> 31:57.656
Let me try. Let me try.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.678
How'd you guess my mom's passcode?

32:09.806 --> 32:10.933
I'm just that good.

32:13.187 --> 32:15.024
In fact, did you know that Robert

32:15.108 --> 32:16.443
actually gifted this unit to Tina

32:16.527 --> 32:18.197
after Wizard's first anniversary?

32:20.828 --> 32:22.247
Dude, what are you doing, man?

32:22.330 --> 32:23.917
Oh, we were just shutting it down.

32:24.001 --> 32:25.713
Do you know how valuable this is?

32:25.796 --> 32:27.590
Do you know how epically Tina Minoru

32:27.674 --> 32:28.760
will lose her shit

32:28.844 --> 32:30.513
if anyone even touched this?

32:30.596 --> 32:33.477
- I'm guessing pretty epically.
- Yeah. She's a killer.

32:40.158 --> 32:41.577
Ow.

32:43.289 --> 32:44.666
Holy shit.

32:44.751 --> 32:48.257
- How did you...?
- It read my DNA...

32:48.341 --> 32:49.509
just like the staff.

32:51.890 --> 32:54.478
I guess 50% Tina's enough
for it to think I'm my mom.

32:54.561 --> 32:57.108
All right, we'll just do it
before it realizes you're not.

33:02.118 --> 33:03.638
It's getting a little chilly out here.

33:04.581 --> 33:06.585
Maybe we should go back inside.

33:06.668 --> 33:09.341
- Maybe we should.
- Oh, yeah? Great.

33:09.424 --> 33:12.389
You know, maybe we should march
in there and I could light up

33:12.472 --> 33:14.017
and I can show the world
what I actually am.

33:14.101 --> 33:15.436
That's not exactly what I had in mind,

33:15.520 --> 33:17.023
but sure, if it gets you
off the ledge...

33:17.107 --> 33:18.526
Maybe it's time to be reckless

33:18.609 --> 33:19.737
and to make some bad decisions

33:19.821 --> 33:21.950
and drink some truly terrible vod...

33:23.536 --> 33:24.536
No!

34:06.748 --> 34:08.042
You can fly?

34:12.760 --> 34:14.722
You scared the shit out of me.

34:14.804 --> 34:15.806
Sorry.

34:23.739 --> 34:26.328
Considering you almost died
without me ever doing that,

34:26.411 --> 34:28.623
I thought this would be
a good time to go for it.

34:40.940 --> 34:43.404
Thank you all for being here.

34:43.487 --> 34:46.076
Robert and I are honored
to be sharing the stage

34:46.159 --> 34:47.996
with our fellow members of PRIDE.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.835
Without their tireless dedication,

34:50.918 --> 34:53.465
we wouldn't be here
celebrating breaking ground

34:53.549 --> 34:56.221
on a new state-of-the-art
community school.

34:56.304 --> 34:57.975
A place that will one day train

34:58.058 --> 35:00.605
the next generation
of Wizard executives.

35:07.619 --> 35:08.872
But of all the people here,

35:08.955 --> 35:10.416
I would most like to thank

35:10.499 --> 35:12.796
my husband Robert

35:12.880 --> 35:16.094
for his commitment to PRIDE,
to Wizard Computers,

35:16.178 --> 35:18.934
and, most importantly, to our family.

35:25.279 --> 35:28.118
And I think Victor Stein
would like to say something.

35:28.202 --> 35:30.749
One of the world's
most brilliant minds...

35:30.832 --> 35:34.422
founder of Nemo, a true visionary...

35:34.506 --> 35:36.677
Save your breath, Tina.
Everyone knows I'm a genius.

35:36.761 --> 35:41.687
Although here's a question
my superior intellect

35:41.771 --> 35:43.565
is of no help in solving.

35:43.649 --> 35:46.279
What should I do about the fact

35:46.363 --> 35:48.785
that my wife is sleeping
with another man?

35:51.164 --> 35:53.419
That's right, Janet.

35:54.964 --> 35:56.884
I know everything.

35:56.968 --> 36:00.349
Any of you know how easy it is
to hack a cell phone?

36:00.433 --> 36:03.355
You'd think that the man
she's banging would.

36:03.439 --> 36:05.443
After all, he helped create the phone.

36:05.526 --> 36:08.490
Isn't that right, Robert?

36:15.296 --> 36:17.633
To PRIDE.

36:20.431 --> 36:21.600
Oh!

36:30.076 --> 36:33.373
Dad. We need help!

36:39.094 --> 36:40.094
Dad!

36:41.264 --> 36:42.264
Dad.

36:43.895 --> 36:46.108
I've got you. I've got you, Dad.

36:58.590 --> 37:00.094
We need to get him to a hospital.

37:00.177 --> 37:02.223
- I'm o... I'm okay.
- No, you're not okay.

37:02.306 --> 37:04.435
- You've got a brain tumor.
- What?

37:06.231 --> 37:07.400
The headaches...

37:09.237 --> 37:10.447
And you knew?

37:10.531 --> 37:11.658
He told me not to tell.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.082
We've been working together
on a project.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.587
Don't blame Chase. I'm his dad.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.591
Victor, if I had known...

37:19.674 --> 37:20.969
If you let me in...

37:21.052 --> 37:22.597
Get away from me.

37:22.680 --> 37:23.808
But you're sick.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.646
You need help.

37:26.731 --> 37:30.529
- All this time...
- Mom. He wants you to leave.

37:36.458 --> 37:37.920
I'll stay with you and your dad.

37:38.003 --> 37:40.591
I'll call 911, go wait
for the paramedics.

37:40.674 --> 37:42.553
I have a better idea.

37:55.287 --> 37:58.252
I'm assuming this means
you need me here after all.

38:02.218 --> 38:03.428
Victor is sick.

38:03.512 --> 38:05.432
He kept it a secret from everyone.

38:05.516 --> 38:07.395
Seems to be a trend amongst the PRIDE.

38:07.478 --> 38:09.274
Affairs, illness...

38:09.357 --> 38:11.278
What else are they hiding from you?

38:11.361 --> 38:14.868
I told you, everything is under control.

38:14.952 --> 38:17.833
Oh, yes, clearly, you're
running a very tight ship.

38:20.087 --> 38:22.884
Take me to him. Now.

38:32.445 --> 38:34.240
Oh, uh, hey, Tina!

38:34.324 --> 38:36.286
I was just, uh... We were checking...

38:36.369 --> 38:38.665
Playing this incredible game.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.627
It's so romantic...

38:40.712 --> 38:42.256
that Mr. Minoru gave this to you.

38:42.340 --> 38:44.677
I really hope to be
as lucky as you some day.

38:49.062 --> 38:51.024
She's a lot scarier when she's quiet.

38:51.107 --> 38:52.107
Shit!

38:59.582 --> 39:00.582
My mom is coming.

39:00.626 --> 39:02.171
I don't hear anything.

40:04.253 --> 40:06.591
- Who's this guy?
- Not to worry.

40:06.674 --> 40:08.804
I taught the good doctors
here everything they know.

40:08.888 --> 40:12.854
I wouldn't say everything,
but... he's a very smart man.

40:12.938 --> 40:14.607
We trusted you.

40:14.690 --> 40:16.653
That's hell of a bedside manner, Leslie.

40:16.737 --> 40:18.240
Well, I'm sorry, but we need Victor.

40:18.323 --> 40:20.536
- Need him for what?
- She's right.

40:20.619 --> 40:21.619
We need Victor.

40:22.874 --> 40:25.087
We all do, and we shall have him.

40:25.170 --> 40:27.759
No, I'm not leaving my dad.

40:27.842 --> 40:30.013
Oh, he's got a cure for brain cancer?

40:30.097 --> 40:32.184
We get that this is upsetting,

40:32.268 --> 40:34.146
but let's leave him to do his thing.

40:38.238 --> 40:41.202
Honey, I'm gonna... You got this, right?

40:41.286 --> 40:42.956
Of course.

40:45.712 --> 40:47.464
Your kid has a point.

40:47.548 --> 40:50.888
You have a cure for cancer in
that little black bag of yours?

40:50.972 --> 40:52.851
It's an experimental immunotherapy

40:52.934 --> 40:55.105
developed from the DNA of someone...

40:56.357 --> 40:58.988
with an extraordinary immune system.

40:59.071 --> 41:01.827
Works to right a variety of ailments.

41:08.924 --> 41:09.926
Shall we, Doctor?

41:10.010 --> 41:11.722
Hmm.

41:11.805 --> 41:12.974
Yeah.

41:15.855 --> 41:18.193
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

41:21.616 --> 41:23.662
Vial. Thank you.

41:43.869 --> 41:45.707
Are you ready?

41:45.790 --> 41:46.959
Do it.

42:24.785 --> 42:26.997
Oh, looks like
I still have the high score.

42:27.080 --> 42:29.084
Oh, you'll make one hell
of a pilot for the rebellion.

42:29.168 --> 42:30.963
- I'll tell you that much.
- Copy that, Gold Leader.

42:31.047 --> 42:34.178
Huh. Well, you should probably
get back to the party,

42:34.261 --> 42:36.098
'cause, you know, your boyfriend's

42:36.182 --> 42:37.811
probably looking everywhere
for you, he's worried...

42:37.894 --> 42:41.359
Oh, he's not, because he doesn't exist.

42:41.442 --> 42:43.196
As in I don't have one.

42:45.033 --> 42:46.745
Cute girl like you?

42:46.829 --> 42:48.874
Where were the girls like you
when I was in high school?

42:48.958 --> 42:50.711
Did you try the theatre department?

42:50.795 --> 42:52.256
- Or the library?
- Come on.

42:52.339 --> 42:54.051
You could probably have
any guy you wanted.

42:54.134 --> 42:55.679
You know, it's like, uh...

42:55.763 --> 42:58.226
You were maybe a little bit...
How old are you?

42:58.309 --> 43:00.731
Okay! And now it just got weird.

43:00.815 --> 43:02.442
But thanks.

43:05.448 --> 43:07.327
God, you know, I feel strange.

43:07.411 --> 43:11.294
Up until now, it's been
all theories and hunches,

43:11.377 --> 43:14.341
right, but as soon as I decrypt
that data, we'll have that tape,

43:14.425 --> 43:17.849
undeniable proof that
our parents are killers.

43:20.020 --> 43:21.230
You having regrets?

43:22.399 --> 43:25.322
It just doesn't make sense.

43:25.405 --> 43:28.328
Do killers really bawl their
eyes out like my mom just did?

43:32.628 --> 43:35.634
The code you used to get
into my mom's office...

43:35.718 --> 43:37.847
what was it?

43:37.931 --> 43:41.437
"Password." Your mom's
a really busy lady.

43:41.520 --> 43:43.191
I figured she'd use something simple.

43:43.274 --> 43:45.863
You know, something that she
could actually remember.

43:45.947 --> 43:48.034
Plus, who would ever think
that the tech titan

43:48.117 --> 43:50.413
Tina Minoru's password
was "password," right?

43:50.497 --> 43:51.540
You did.

43:52.626 --> 43:54.421
I got lucky, I guess.

43:55.674 --> 43:56.969
Really lucky.

43:58.262 --> 44:00.392
How'd it go?

44:00.475 --> 44:02.104
Mission successful.

44:02.187 --> 44:03.648
How was the party?

44:03.732 --> 44:06.780
Great. Fine. Saved Karolina's life.

44:06.863 --> 44:09.744
Well, tried to,
but, hey, luckily she can fly.

44:12.416 --> 44:13.752
Big night.

44:13.836 --> 44:15.296
That's an understatement.

44:15.380 --> 44:17.342
You hear about our parents?

44:18.594 --> 44:19.848
They're having an affair.

44:20.975 --> 44:23.354
What? My mom and... your dad?

44:23.438 --> 44:24.816
No, my mom and...

44:24.899 --> 44:26.444
Oh, my God, and my mom?

44:26.527 --> 44:28.656
No, my mom, your dad.

44:28.741 --> 44:30.911
My dad...

44:49.114 --> 44:52.037
- It's nice to see you on your feet.
- Yeah.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.800
Look, I know we have
a lot to talk about...

44:53.832 --> 44:56.212
Oh, why? Never felt better.

44:56.295 --> 44:57.757
I've got a new lease on life,

44:57.840 --> 44:59.928
and a beautiful wife who loves me.

45:00.011 --> 45:01.597
What more could a man want?

45:01.680 --> 45:05.188
So, everything okay with you guys?

45:06.357 --> 45:07.692
I have no idea.

45:07.777 --> 45:09.279
Come here.

45:20.260 --> 45:21.262
Karolina?

45:25.311 --> 45:28.861
I've been looking forward
to meeting you all evening.

45:28.944 --> 45:31.282
Why? Who are you?

45:34.288 --> 45:36.667
I'm a friend of your mother's.

45:36.751 --> 45:38.588
I know my mom's friends.

45:38.671 --> 45:42.679
I'm an old friend... new in town.

45:42.763 --> 45:46.312
I'm... I'm Jonah.

45:50.528 --> 45:51.697
It's my pleasure.

45:55.538 --> 45:57.125
Is everything okay, kiddo?

45:57.209 --> 45:58.754
We're about to head out of here.

46:00.089 --> 46:02.385
Room for one more in your car?

46:02.469 --> 46:03.596
Always.

46:06.268 --> 46:10.778
It's nice to finally meet you
face to face, Karolina.

46:24.554 --> 46:26.058
I've seen your films, Mr. Dean...

46:29.273 --> 46:32.612
but it's your work for the
church that I truly admire.

46:34.700 --> 46:37.539
I'm sure it was exciting to
finally get out to the crater.

46:38.582 --> 46:39.836
News travels fast.

46:41.297 --> 46:42.925
I guess going Ultra wasn't for me.

46:43.009 --> 46:46.975
My friend, you went Ultra.

46:48.602 --> 46:50.273
You just didn't know it.

46:55.868 --> 46:58.581
Frank should have no memory of Jonah.

46:58.664 --> 47:00.335
I took care of that myself.

47:00.418 --> 47:01.713
He doesn't.

47:01.796 --> 47:04.217
What the hell do they
have to talk about?

47:05.553 --> 47:07.098
Nothing good.

47:15.323 --> 47:17.160
Hey, have you seen Chase?

47:17.243 --> 47:19.749
Gert, I don't think you
should look for him.

47:19.832 --> 47:22.087
- Why?
- Because I did see him.

47:22.170 --> 47:25.301
He left the party and I wanted
to know why, so I followed him.

47:26.763 --> 47:28.934
He was up on the roof kissing Karolina.

47:30.729 --> 47:32.273
I'm sorry if you
didn't want to know this.

47:32.357 --> 47:33.837
I just can't handle any more secrets.

47:34.987 --> 47:36.698
No, you did the right thing.

47:50.601 --> 47:52.689
Hey, Molly, I got your text.

47:52.773 --> 47:54.861
- I was hoping we could talk.
- About my parents?

47:54.944 --> 47:56.196
Well, about what you wrote.

47:56.280 --> 47:58.117
What did you mean
"time was running out"?

47:58.200 --> 47:59.954
I meant what I said.
You just don't understand.

48:00.037 --> 48:02.250
If something happens, I need
answers before it's too late.

48:02.333 --> 48:04.964
What is gonna happen?
Why are you so upset?

48:05.047 --> 48:07.010
I'm not upset, it's just
you're taking too long.

48:07.093 --> 48:09.139
Why don't we go talk in my car.

48:09.222 --> 48:10.475
We'll have more privacy.

48:10.558 --> 48:11.685
There's nothing, I swear.

48:11.769 --> 48:13.147
I just want to know about my parents.

48:13.230 --> 48:15.693
I didn't see a thing.

48:15.777 --> 48:17.447
What did you just say?

48:18.532 --> 48:20.161
Nothing.

48:20.244 --> 48:23.125
Just some weird robes.
It must've been a party.

48:23.209 --> 48:25.714
- I don't know.
- Everything all right over here?

48:32.602 --> 48:33.813
You ready to go, Moll?

48:34.941 --> 48:35.943
Okay.

48:36.026 --> 48:37.278
Good night.

48:37.362 --> 48:38.447
Good night.

48:45.419 --> 48:46.672
What was that all about?

48:46.756 --> 48:48.676
I messed up. Big time.

48:50.096 --> 48:51.975
Molly was in the basement.

48:52.058 --> 48:54.479
I think she saw everything.
