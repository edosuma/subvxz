<i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:

00:14.055 --> 00:16.683
[Blake] Matthew knew where
the bodies were buried.

00:16.766 --> 00:19.477
I didn't wanna kill Matthew,
I just wanted to hurt him.

00:19.561 --> 00:23.064
[Anders] If Culhane realizes the
connection between his father's disease

00:23.148 --> 00:26.317
and what CA covered up,
it might not be easy to handle.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.277
This is CA's fault.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.237
I will make sure he does right by you.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.364
I'm appointing my daughter COO.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.991
My wife is stepping down.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.577
There was a baby boy,
he was kidnapped.

00:35.660 --> 00:40.165
I have hired investigators, psychics,
anything. Anything to find a trace.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.875
-Can I help you?
-I'm your brother.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.918
I knew what Blake was keeping from you.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.420

I hope you've taken
your allergy medication.

01:48.316 --> 01:51.653
-I assume none of these are from you.
-What do I have to apologize for?

01:51.736 --> 01:53.780
-I don't know. Stealing my job?
-I told you,

01:53.863 --> 01:57.242
-I had no idea he was gonna offer it.
-Didn't stop you from taking it.

01:57.325 --> 02:02.038
You would've done the same if you were
in my position. Oh, that's right, you did.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.626
See you in the car, Casanova?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.216
It's not much,

02:13.341 --> 02:17.804
but it's all they had left after some fool
bought the rest of the shop.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.515
I'm glad you helped someone
keep their job.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.475
I plead guilty
to crimes and misdemeanors

02:22.559 --> 02:24.310
of which I stand charged,
Your Honor.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.479
Cut the crap. This is serious.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.732
If you wanted me out of the company,
why not pull me aside and say so?

02:29.816 --> 02:32.944
Your being COO has been tough
on this relationship.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.070
It was extreme,

02:34.154 --> 02:37.949
but firing you was the only way I knew
how to save this marriage.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.243
If you let me, I'll explain.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.537
Maybe at dinner?
I could get a table at Daniel.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.038
-In New York?
-Why not?

02:44.539 --> 02:47.876
A lot needs fixing
before I hop on a jet with you.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.964
But I do wanna fix it.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.644
Here. My initial thoughts
on overhauling and streamlining.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.730
Well, this is huge.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.107
It's alphabetical. That's A through E.

03:11.190 --> 03:14.152
I address going paperless
in the environmental concerns section.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.863
-Now, as you read, I wanna talk--
-Whoa. Slow down.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.741
We have a lot of PR to handle.
You were right.

03:19.824 --> 03:22.785
The conference denying involvement
in the scandal

03:22.869 --> 03:26.372
-didn't put investors at ease.
-CA's statement was fake.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.166
Which is why
we have to make changes

03:28.249 --> 03:30.293
if we're gonna put this nightmare
behind us,

03:30.376 --> 03:31.586
at least publicly.

03:31.669 --> 03:32.837
Per your suggestion,

03:32.921 --> 03:36.257
I put together a team
to work on a rebranding campaign.

03:36.341 --> 03:40.053
Rebranding the company feels like
covering a bullet wound with a Band-Aid.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.679
I set up a day of press interviews

03:41.763 --> 03:44.015
and a family photo shoot
to remind our investors

03:44.098 --> 03:45.183
what we stand for.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.603
CA is a family company
with solid family values.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.689
"Make Carrington Great Again."
Cap off our outfits with a red hat?

03:51.773 --> 03:52.982
I'm serious, Fallon.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.109
I am listening to you.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.571
As my COO,
I need to know you'll listen to me.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.199
Of course I'll listen.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.619
I have your back, Dad. You can trust me.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.538
[Monica] <i>How can you trust her?</i>

04:07.664 --> 04:11.042
That's some pretty big 23andMe
gossip for Alexis to drop.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.545
You think Granny slept
with Thomas Carrington?

04:14.629 --> 04:18.507
Don't wanna think about it.
You don't make something like that up.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.719
If Alexis is right,
if Mom is Blake's half-sister,

04:22.262 --> 04:23.972
that makes us one-quarter Carrington.

04:24.555 --> 04:27.058
-That means Fallon's our cousin.
-Half cousin.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.227
Hope you slept with the right half.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.021
That's why Blake never
wanted me with her,

04:32.480 --> 04:34.732
why he took us under his wing
when we were kids,

04:34.816 --> 04:38.111
-interest he showed in Mom.
-Why Dad thought they had an affair.

04:38.194 --> 04:42.323
If they'd known the truth,
maybe our family would still be together.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.535
-Why wouldn't Alexis tell us before?
-She was scared.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.956
Considering how far they
covered this up, he might've killed her.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.208
-That's their problem.
-If it's true?

04:52.917 --> 04:55.712
It means our life was twisted
around their lies.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.255
<i>If</i> it's true.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.842
Which is why we're going to the source.

-Steven.

05:08.808 --> 05:12.061
Oh, thank God you're back.
Oh, I missed you.

05:12.562 --> 05:16.065
Oh, why on earth did I let you go
when I just got you back?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.567
-Mom.
-And only you

05:17.650 --> 05:20.903
-could go to Texas and not get any sun.
-Mom, heh-- Mom...

05:21.821 --> 05:23.740
it was the best trip of my life.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.826
I would like to introduce you to...

05:28.494 --> 05:29.329
Hank Sullivan.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.876
Is this a friend of yours?

05:34.959 --> 05:35.793
No, Mom.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.254
He's your son.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.300
-This is Adam.
-Nice to meet you, ma'am.

05:43.342 --> 05:45.344
How--? How did you find him?

05:45.511 --> 05:50.308
I knocked on about 82 doors in El Paso,
but here he is.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.519
I grew up there with my parents.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.897
Well, adoptive parents.

05:56.355 --> 05:59.025
I always wondered
about my biological family.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.612
Never in a million years
did I imagine... this.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.405
[whimpering]

06:09.368 --> 06:10.328
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:11.204 --> 06:15.208
I'm sorry, I've dreamed of this moment
for as long as I can remember.

06:15.750 --> 06:19.629
Are you hungry? Tired?
Did you have the staff prepare a room?

06:20.046 --> 06:23.174
Baby steps.
There's still a lot for Adam to take in.

06:23.716 --> 06:27.512
I'm not even sure what I should call you.
Adam, Hank, brother?

06:27.595 --> 06:30.223
-Hank is fine. Baby steps, right?
-Yeah.

Welcome to your first day.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.315

We spoke on the phone.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.566
How's the office?

06:40.650 --> 06:43.486
The new furniture's being placed,
white sage has been burned,

06:43.569 --> 06:46.280
and most traces of Mrs. Carrington
have been incinerated.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.074
The hideous turquoise bowl?

06:48.157 --> 06:50.952
On your desk for you to break,
per your request.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.829
I'm here for what you need.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.164
You're here because my assistant
is choosing

06:55.248 --> 06:57.583
between buttercream or fondant
for his wedding cake.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.585
So, what do I have today?

06:59.710 --> 07:02.213
Operations meeting at 11,
PR team at 11:20

07:02.296 --> 07:05.508
and the final interviewee for the VP job
in our outreach program

07:05.591 --> 07:06.843
is in your office.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.720
Who'd do an outreach program
during a PR crisis?

07:10.221 --> 07:11.222
That would be me.

07:12.932 --> 07:13.766

-Wait, you're--?
-I do have a communications degree.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.066
I mean, I-- Yes, I did. I do. I--

07:25.862 --> 07:28.114
I didn't know you were
willing to communicate.

07:28.281 --> 07:32.243
Cristal got me the interview.
I didn't know that it'd be with you.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.873
-This was a mistake.
-No, wait. You don't need an interview.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.458
The job is yours if you want it.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.750
I appreciate that.

07:39.834 --> 07:43.838
I'm not playing whatever game we used
to play. I'm here to make sure CA fixes

07:43.921 --> 07:46.466
-the Clarke County situation.
-Me, too.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.635
I'm going to make good
on my promise to you.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.888
At the risk of losing the job you wanted?

07:53.139 --> 07:55.391
-What would Daddy say?
-Blake isn't going to know.

07:55.683 --> 07:59.103
I told him what he wanted to hear,
I took this job for you.

To make sure you and your family
get everything you deserve.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.901

Sorry to interrupt your
National Gallery moment,

08:31.219 --> 08:33.554
but I need you to authorize
a check for 100 million

08:33.638 --> 08:37.099
to build a new wing for the Northend
Memorial Hospital in Clarke County.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.895
Capture the thing that happened
to his eyes, that's his essence.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.188
Mind telling me why we would do that?

08:43.272 --> 08:45.733
When I say Clarke County,
get out your checkbook.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.485
Name it after Culhane's father.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.071
Absolutely not. That's admission of guilt.

08:50.154 --> 08:54.158
-The mouth. Please get that.
-I'm not putting his name on anything.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.203
If you wanna spin it like
an equal-opportunity donor, that's fine.

08:57.286 --> 09:01.541
We can spread the money. Let's say,
over five counties, 30 million each?

09:01.624 --> 09:04.544
-You just went up in price.
-Making sure you're paying attention.

09:04.710 --> 09:09.257
Twenty each, and honor Culhane without
a plaque, since you're unsentimental.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.426
Will that do it? You're here two hours,
you cost me--

09:12.510 --> 09:16.430
One hundred million like I said.
Had you agreed, we'd be done.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.849

09:18.933 --> 09:20.977
You're a generous humanitarian, Blake.

-At least on paper and canvas.
-Not to mention I have a smart COO.

09:25.982 --> 09:26.816
Well done.

09:30.069 --> 09:33.656
He threatened me, he blackmailed me...

09:34.699 --> 09:37.326
he even fired me from the company
on live TV.

09:39.328 --> 09:40.705
I can't live like this.

09:41.872 --> 09:42.790
Did he hit you?

09:43.249 --> 09:45.209
No. No, he would never.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.880
But sometimes I think he wants me
to be afraid of him.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.591
Soon he'll be afraid of us.

-Actually.
-I knew it.

and my parents presumed he was dead.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.802
Speaking of the Carringtons...

12:04.515 --> 12:06.183
What happened with you and Thomas?

12:09.270 --> 12:10.271
What do you mean?

12:11.188 --> 12:14.859
-Well, you were his assistant, right?
-Secretary.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.612
Heh. Women's lib came late to Atlanta.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.781
That's all you were? We heard--

12:20.865 --> 12:23.242
-Watch your tone, young man.
-Yes, ma'am.

12:24.785 --> 12:28.998
There were rumors about me and
Thomas as long as I worked for him.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.377
Almost cost me my job,
not to mention my reputation.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.005
I thought I'd outlived all of that.

12:36.088 --> 12:40.342
And I thought I taught the two of you
better than to listen to rumors.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.052
Sorry, Granny.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.180
You're right.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.806
[Culhane] <i>What happened?</i>

12:45.890 --> 12:50.144
If my math is correct, Clarke County's
only getting 20 percent of the funding.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.688
Trying to spread the wealth.
Still a lot of money.

12:52.771 --> 12:56.442
-But not what we discussed.
-I know, but it's progress.

12:56.525 --> 12:57.902
It's a multi-step plan.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.820
Please, Culhane.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.407
I need you on my side
to see this through.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.162
I'm here. For now.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.168
But I can't wait forever.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.175
[Alexis] Welcome to Carrington Manor.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.512
Oh, well, your real family
is around here somewhere,

13:25.054 --> 13:27.765
but for now,
this is your father's wife, Celia.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.058
I mean Cristal.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.685
It's confusing. And this is Sam.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.022
And this is my son.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.651
My firstborn, Adam.
But you can call him Hank.

13:39.305 --> 13:45.722
