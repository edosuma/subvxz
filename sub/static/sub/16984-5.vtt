WEBVTT

00:06.520 --> 00:09.558
I mean we're all being very
grown up about this but...

00:09.600 --> 00:11.273
Let me know if you feel any discomfort.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.231
Oh no, it's lovely, thank you.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.514
Your father informed me
of your family history.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.279
Yeah, evil boobs everywhere.

00:19.800 --> 00:20.800
Arm up, please.

00:23.720 --> 00:28.669
Wa-he-hey... stop it!
I'm sorry, I'm just ticklish.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.158
I examined your sister this morning.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.272
Did you? Did she... is she alright?
Did she seem alright?

00:35.320 --> 00:37.072
Yes. Why?

00:37.760 --> 00:40.070
Just can't get hold of her.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.033
She seemed very busy.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.150
Mmm, sure.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.278
Dad books us boob
appointments once a year

00:47.320 --> 00:49.709
to make sure our tits don't
turn on us like mum's did.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.277
It's a bit of a hassle but at the
end of the day it's nice to be touched.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.799
Bet you look forward to seeing Claire.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.961
A lot more to touch, if you
know what I mean. - SHE LAUGHS

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

01:03.040 --> 01:05.077
I'm sorry, it's just that
there are worse jobs.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.559
Look...

01:08.560 --> 01:11.598
I check for cancerous
lumps in mammary glands.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.554
Now, any pleasure I derive from that

01:14.600 --> 01:18.389
is entirely dependent upon whether
or not I am about to save your life.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.275
Of course, Doctor.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.233
You can put your clothes back on.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.799
Hey... hey... she's here.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.416
I've been waiting out here
for nearly ten minutes.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.351
Well, you left me
on the fucking silent hill.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.595
Yes, well, I had to.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.150
Did you get back OK?
God this is so stressful.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.349
Mum's memorial lunch.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.720
I should have worn my other coat.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.117
Visiting Dad is hell for Claire.
I see it more as a sport.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.117
It's so inappropriate
that she should be here.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.230
Have you spoken to Martin?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.640
No, it's fine, everything's fine.
Everything's totally fine.

01:55.664 --> 01:56.779
Sounds like it's fine.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.158
Can you please just gimme some space!
You're standing so close to me!

02:02.256 --> 02:03.256
CLAIRE SIGHS

02:03.280 --> 02:04.509
Ready?

02:04.960 --> 02:06.314
DOORBELL RINGS

02:06.360 --> 02:07.714
THEY BOTH SIGH

02:09.120 --> 02:11.680
Don't tell Dad about Finland
and don't provoke her.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.956
Let's just get out of this alive, OK?

02:17.640 --> 02:18.640
Girls...

02:19.560 --> 02:20.675
Gotta hand it to her.

02:20.720 --> 02:21.391
Hi.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.475
Oh, you shouldn't have!

02:23.120 --> 02:24.952
Oh, they're actually for Dad.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.320
Oh, are they Freesias?

02:26.360 --> 02:28.120
Yeah, they were sort
of a favourite of our...

02:28.144 --> 02:29.896
GODMOTHER:
Oh gosh, how special.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.719
How lovely.
Aren't they stunning?

02:31.760 --> 02:32.760
SHE CHUCKLES

02:33.080 --> 02:38.314
Oh, let's just leave them... there.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.997
Lovely. Come in.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.998
Who's Dad sawing in half?

02:52.040 --> 02:53.040
Oh, just the tree.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.349
Sorry?

02:54.400 --> 02:55.356
The tree in the back garden.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.720
Why are you taking the tree down?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.958
Oh, Felicity tried to use it to get out.
She's very expensive.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.195
CAT MEOWS

03:02.240 --> 03:03.240
This is nice.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.920
Oh, thank you.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.553
Oh, this is beautiful!

03:08.480 --> 03:11.598
I hope you don't mind my being here
but my Pilates fell through so...

03:11.640 --> 03:13.160
Oh, of course.
- Gosh, no, it's lovely.

03:13.280 --> 03:17.035
It's a sad day. Sad, sad day.
I'll get the champagne.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.159
This is my favourite bit.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.553
Wonder who's going to...

03:35.600 --> 03:36.920
That's a lovely cushion.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.273
Thanks, it's an original.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.080
Gosh.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.835
I love your hat.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.235
It's a hair scarf.

03:48.920 --> 03:49.920
Looks like a hat.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.593
Well, it's a hair scarf.
- SHE LAUGHS

03:54.920 --> 03:55.920
OK.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.320
Is Martin coming?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.358
Oh, no, he's away.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.677
I'm very excited to meet
your new chap.

04:06.880 --> 04:07.880
Is he...

04:08.240 --> 04:09.639
Oh no, he's a different one.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.674
Ooh. You do turn over fast.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.277
Dad'II come in with some
weird canapes in a second.

04:19.920 --> 04:20.920
Girls!

04:24.120 --> 04:25.872
Hello.
- How are you?

04:25.920 --> 04:27.638
CLAIRE: Hi.
- Hello, yeah...

04:28.640 --> 04:32.554
yeah, I'm really sorry about all
that noise, it... you got a drink?

04:32.760 --> 04:33.760
Oh.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.275
Oh sorry. I forgot your glass.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.155
Well, you're both looking
very healthy, very...

04:41.960 --> 04:44.713
good and healthy and...

04:46.200 --> 04:49.670
did you talk to
Dr Samuels about your...?

04:50.800 --> 04:51.800
Yep.
- Yes.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.032
And they're happy,
they're getting along alright?

04:57.840 --> 04:59.478
Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. Great.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.794
Good. Excellent.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.877
You are my...

05:05.920 --> 05:06.920
daughters...

05:07.520 --> 05:08.520
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

05:10.480 --> 05:12.232
Yep.
- Yes. Yeah, we are.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.120
Sit down.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.835
I think I should say a few
words about your mother.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.269
Ignore me. Ignore me.
Ignore me.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.640
This day is not an easy one...

05:24.680 --> 05:25.715
CORK POPS

05:26.240 --> 05:29.278
SHE LAUGHS
- Sorry. Cheers.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
To Mum.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.440
To Mum.

05:32.960 --> 05:33.960
To Margaret.

05:34.680 --> 05:35.795
Dearest Margaret.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.274
Just the most generous woman.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.400
Yeah, well, she certainly was.
- Yeah, she was great.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.599
DAD LAUGHS

05:46.640 --> 05:49.632
It was the voices
she used for the pigeons.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.956
She always made them so, so rude

05:52.000 --> 05:54.514
you know, but very, very funny.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.591
She used to take the girls round
the park and point at the...

05:58.640 --> 06:00.756
Oh, the squirrel voices were the best.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.915
(DEEP VOICE)
Run!

06:01.960 --> 06:04.474
Run, fucking run!
- Run, run, run, run, run...

06:04.520 --> 06:06.909
Run, run, run, run, run...

06:06.960 --> 06:10.271
Yes, yes, my ex did a similar thing,
voices and fun.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.678
Really, really funny man.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.634
Really funny.

06:16.656 --> 06:17.816
Can I help you with the food?

06:17.840 --> 06:19.911
Yes, yes, I should, yes.

06:19.960 --> 06:20.995
And take that off.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.040
Alright.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.199
So are you going to Finland?

06:37.560 --> 06:39.240
You're gonna have to
talk to me eventually.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.355
Plaits...

06:48.840 --> 06:51.878
either she's got her period
or some serious shit's gone down.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.120
She always does something slightly
different around her period.

06:55.144 --> 06:57.260
She gets really bad PMT.

06:57.480 --> 07:01.394
Mum used to call it her monthly
confidence crisis but it's PMT.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.834
The only way she can get through it is
to reinvent herself in some small way.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
What?

07:15.120 --> 07:16.400
I'm doing a wee on this cushion.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.440
What!

07:20.040 --> 07:21.599
Sort of wish you were.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.560
What are you doing?

07:30.600 --> 07:32.432
Just put it back
where you got it from, OK?

07:32.480 --> 07:33.197
No!

07:33.440 --> 07:35.954
Just do it.
I don't want it in my house.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.796
I'm doing you a massive favour. She could
really go to town on you for this.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.232
Come on, what's she gonna do, draw me?

07:42.576 --> 07:43.576
Go!

07:43.600 --> 07:44.600
No.

07:45.480 --> 07:48.233
OK, OK, OK... Jesus.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.839
CLAIRE:
Why are we sneaking?

07:57.880 --> 07:59.075
We're not allowed upstairs.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.120
Of course we are.

08:10.360 --> 08:13.591
God, I keep forgetting that
she's actually talented.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.199
I know, it's infuriating.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.360
Go on then.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.595
Where's her head?

08:19.640 --> 08:21.560
Well, she's got your boobs,
she doesn't need one.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.280
OK...

08:28.920 --> 08:29.920
OK. Hey...

08:31.160 --> 08:33.720
is everything OK with Martin?

08:36.320 --> 08:37.640
You've invited someone today?

08:37.679 --> 08:40.798
Yeah. Yeah, he's horrifically hot.
You're gonna puke when you see him.

08:41.696 --> 08:42.696
Are you on your period?

08:42.720 --> 08:43.720
Why would you ask that?

08:44.135 --> 08:45.136
The plaits.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.160
No reason.
- Say it.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
The plaits.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.991
Hey... do you think she's
ever painted Dad naked?

08:53.080 --> 08:55.993
I think you should take your nose
out of other people's marriages.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.476
Ooh, sneaking a preview, are we?

09:00.920 --> 09:05.517
Sorry, I spilt my champagne and...
I got distracted on my way to the bathroom.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.230
Me too.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.113
It's really beautiful work.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.276
Thank you.
Let me show you to the loo.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.233
Oh, that's alright,
grew up in this house.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.754
It's all change now though.

09:22.800 --> 09:23.995
Your father's in the kitchen.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.556
Oh great. I'll go and torment him.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.670
THEY LAUGH

09:32.920 --> 09:35.719
He hates being alone in
a room with me. Watch this.

09:37.136 --> 09:38.136
Hi, Dad!

09:38.160 --> 09:39.434
Oh! Um...

09:42.720 --> 09:45.314
Um, I just need some...

09:45.960 --> 09:46.960
What do you need?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.991
Need some salt.

09:49.560 --> 09:50.560
There it is.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.309
Oh, here it is, yeah.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.991
So... how are you darling, you alright?

10:01.160 --> 10:03.629
Have you got enough clothes?

10:03.960 --> 10:05.400
Oh, could never have enough clothes.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.432
Right. And how's the café?

10:07.880 --> 10:10.599
Erm. Well, the lease is up
in a couple of days and...

10:10.640 --> 10:12.233
I don't think I can really afford to...

10:12.280 --> 10:15.238
I think I'm just gonna
have to accept that it's...

10:15.280 --> 10:18.200
I'm sorry about that, darling,
but of course we're just a little bit tight

10:18.224 --> 10:19.355
in the purse strings too.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.311
Oh no, no, I wasn't asking you for any...

10:21.360 --> 10:23.720
We've just been keeping it quiet,
we haven't been able to...

10:23.800 --> 10:25.393
buy anything or do anything and...

10:28.880 --> 10:30.234
Oh... what's that?

10:31.160 --> 10:37.509
Oh that, that's just a tiny little
house we're buying in... France.

10:38.840 --> 10:39.840
Lovely.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.990
Yeah. I... I just wanted to talk to you

10:45.120 --> 10:47.350
about this exhibition.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.674
What exhibition?

10:49.800 --> 10:50.835
DAD SHOUTS

10:50.880 --> 10:52.632
DAD: Oh no!
- Jesus, Dad, OK!

10:52.680 --> 10:56.230
Pick it up! Pick it up! Help me, please...
- Jesus, Dad, OK.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.435
She mustn't see it. She mustn't find out!
- OK!

11:01.440 --> 11:02.839
Mmm, five second rule.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.872
No, I have never bought into
that rule, that's disgusting!

11:09.080 --> 11:10.080
THEY LAUGH

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
What are you doing?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.400
Oh, just a little family tradition.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.064
Oh... what odd fun.
What are the rules?

11:18.776 --> 11:19.776
DOORBELL RINGS

11:19.800 --> 11:21.871
Oh... thank God,
that'll be your man.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.790
I mean I didn't wanna show off but...

11:31.680 --> 11:34.194
Gosh... you really are...

11:36.240 --> 11:37.240
So how did you two meet?

11:37.760 --> 11:38.760
Fucked me up the arse.

11:38.800 --> 11:44.034
I used to manage a bar and... I just found
her crying in the toilet one night.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.557
How about you two,
how did you two meet?

11:48.600 --> 11:49.760
Through our mother, actually.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.717
How is work, Claire?

11:55.800 --> 11:58.076
Oh... fine, nothing new.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.080
She used to be our Godmother.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.911
Still am. But then their parents split up.

12:03.960 --> 12:04.960
Mum died.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.033
And we just became even closer friends.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.869
Do you know... and I can say
this because I'm an artist

12:10.920 --> 12:13.833
but you really are very good looking.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.240
Thank you.

12:15.920 --> 12:16.920
Very.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.120
Thank you.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.280
Very.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.600
Thank you.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.915
I mean almost...

12:25.600 --> 12:27.557
too good looking.
- SHE LAUGHS

12:29.560 --> 12:32.393
Well, if you'll excuse me I'm gonna
go and do that old human thing.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.672
How's the exhibition going?

12:41.280 --> 12:45.478
Ah yes, yes... I wanted to
talk to you about that.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.520
Talking about me?

12:46.960 --> 12:50.237
All good things, all good things, I swear.

12:51.576 --> 12:52.576
Oh and again.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.600
THEY ALL LAUGH

12:56.600 --> 12:57.715
Have you found a venue?

12:57.760 --> 12:58.760
What exhibition?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.474
Thank you so much for asking.

13:00.520 --> 13:01.999
We have actually found a...

13:02.040 --> 13:07.274
There are some elements of the work that I,
you know, I wanted to talk to you about.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.833
It's a sexhibition.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.320
But don't panic, it's nothing scary.

13:10.344 --> 13:13.636
It's simply a journey through
my physical and sexual life

13:13.680 --> 13:17.639
climaxing in a few pieces inspired
by and moulded on your father.

13:18.880 --> 13:19.915
And there are photos.

13:19.960 --> 13:23.840
I've taken a photo of my naked body
every year for the past 30 years.

13:24.376 --> 13:25.376
Why?

13:25.400 --> 13:29.075
Well, I think it's important for women
of all ages to see how my body has changed

13:29.120 --> 13:30.269
over the years.

13:30.520 --> 13:34.798
I think we have to have a healthy
perspective on my body, don't they?

13:35.200 --> 13:36.395
Oh, absolutely.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.120
I mean, I don't need to tell you

13:38.520 --> 13:42.115
but your father is
a deeply sexual man.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.154
No, you don't.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.520
Just did.

13:45.720 --> 13:46.720
Knew it.

13:46.880 --> 13:51.397
I'm just very lucky.
I will be touched until the day I die

13:51.440 --> 13:52.510
and so will you, Claire.

13:53.400 --> 13:59.476
I mean, it's really all that humans want,
is to be loved and to be touched.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.920
CAT MEOWS

14:08.120 --> 14:09.155
CAT MEOWS

14:14.480 --> 14:16.000
Tell Dad about your promotion, Claire.

14:17.336 --> 14:18.336
There's nothing to tell.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.395
What promotion?

14:20.016 --> 14:21.016
Finland.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.792
Oh, odd place.
- Any news?

14:22.840 --> 14:24.319
No.
- She got it.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.078
GODMOTHER GASPS
- Oh!

14:26.120 --> 14:27.190
Fuck's sake.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.959
Congratulations, Claire.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.149
Thank you.
- Clever girl.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.031
Can we not.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.117
This is so exciting.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.195
She's turning it down.

14:35.480 --> 14:36.800
Why?
- GODMOTHER: Why?

14:36.840 --> 14:38.816
Why... why not, why Claire?
- GODMOTHER: Claire, are you pregnant?

14:38.840 --> 14:41.229
Why aren't you getting on a plane
to your cold rich future?

14:41.280 --> 14:43.400
Oh, Claire!
- This is everything you'd ever hoped for.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.954
You can't just fuck off on aeroplanes

14:46.000 --> 14:50.392
and leave your weird stepson and
broken sister to fend for themselves, OK?

15:02.360 --> 15:03.360
FLEABAG CLEARS HER THROAT

15:04.520 --> 15:05.590
Excuse me.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.280
BOO: She's your sister,
it's your job to annoy her.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.920
No, no, I'm just so annoyed with myself.

15:23.944 --> 15:28.859
I wish I could just meet myself and just...
have a go at myself!

15:47.520 --> 15:48.520
Do your worst.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.115
Come on, Bitch!

15:54.640 --> 15:56.039
You don't take yourself seriously.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.397
Oh pussy.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.351
You need to reach out to your family.

16:01.376 --> 16:03.456
You need to stop provoking your sister.
Just grow up!

16:03.480 --> 16:05.416
You do not take yourself
seriously as a businesswoman.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.080
You need to pay your fucking bills!
You need to be nicer to Hilary.

16:08.104 --> 16:09.299
You need to get a new hat!

16:10.016 --> 16:11.016
Is that better?

16:11.040 --> 16:12.269
Yeah, it's better.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.597
CLAWING AT DOOR

16:50.440 --> 16:54.149
OK. Off you go.

16:58.440 --> 17:01.000
The artwork in this house is stunning.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.600
Who is it?

17:03.840 --> 17:06.309
If I tell you will you promise
to come to my sexhibition?

17:07.400 --> 17:08.400
It's not your work?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.319
Will you come?

17:10.960 --> 17:12.314
It would be an honor.

17:14.520 --> 17:15.954
How's your little restaurant?

17:16.680 --> 17:17.680
It's a cafe'.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.433
Oh, don't do it a disservice.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.911
I'm not. It's a café.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.628
Oh, sorry.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.429
It's fine. It's fine.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.237
Your father tells me you're struggling.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.873
Well... I think we all are.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.753
Oh, well, yes. But I mean,
now there's only one of you...

17:36.800 --> 17:38.600
God, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.320
Sorry, have I missed something?

17:42.344 --> 17:44.954
Well... her dear little friend died

17:45.000 --> 17:47.196
and left her to run the cafe on her own.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.240
Jesus.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.752
Oh God, that is truly awful.
How did she die?

17:50.800 --> 17:51.631
Oh, she killed herself.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.750
It was an accident.

17:54.680 --> 17:58.958
Well... maybe it's time to let the
little restaurant go, give it up.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.798
Sell it, have a little holiday.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.629
FLEABAG:
We did this.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.640
BOO:
Mm-hmm.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.153
And whatever happens,
we never let it 90, OK?

18:18.480 --> 18:19.550
Excuse me.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.394
Have you seen Felicity?

18:34.400 --> 18:35.400
Oh no, sorry.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.480
Gosh, all sorts of things go
missing in this house, don't they?

18:38.504 --> 18:39.111
Big house.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.230
Yes, lovely house.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.995
Oh, the sculpture turned up.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.040
Did it?
- Yes. Must have just toppled off the side.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.591
Well... if you rid a woman
of her head and limbs

18:47.640 --> 18:49.560
you can't expect her to do
anything other than...

18:49.976 --> 18:50.976
roll around.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.196
THEY LAUGH

18:57.960 --> 18:58.960
What?

18:59.160 --> 19:01.754
Oh, your father and I often say

19:01.800 --> 19:04.792
when you've had a few drinks
you're so like your mother.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.593
GODMOTHER:
Oh, whoops... look at these.

19:19.800 --> 19:23.111
So the party's moved to the hallway,
always a good sign.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.470
Does anyone mind if I leave,
I've got a dicky tummy?

19:25.520 --> 19:26.520
So swift.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.120
Thanks.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.760
I'm not going to kiss you
because I'm probably very ill.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.634
You too, come on.

19:32.680 --> 19:36.594
Goodbye then, my... my daughters.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.720
Goodbye.

19:47.840 --> 19:48.910
What a lovely occasion.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.118
Yeah, see you at the sexhibition.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.879
No, there's absolutely no need...
- Yes, lovely.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.639
No, no, we'll definitely be there.
I will definitely be there.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.032
Hold up... Yeah,
trying to keep me overnight?

20:01.080 --> 20:03.117
SHE LAUGHS
- Very good looking.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.360
I might never see you again.
You're very good looking.

20:07.384 --> 20:09.341
Yes, yes, very good looking.

20:16.600 --> 20:17.715
SHE SIGHS

20:20.280 --> 20:21.600
Thanks, I owe you.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.519
No, I owe you.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.280
It's been really nice to spend
the day with a normal family.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.840
I actually feel quite emotional.

20:30.680 --> 20:31.880
Will you stay with me tonight?

20:32.840 --> 20:33.840
Sure.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.074
I'm gonna go warm up the bike.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.120
Lovely to meet you, Claire.

20:39.144 --> 20:40.144
You too.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.394
Um, what's his...

20:42.440 --> 20:43.350
Fucked me up the arse.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.435
Oh that's...

20:45.680 --> 20:46.795
I totally see that now.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.632
BIRDS CHIRP

20:53.880 --> 20:55.029
I'm sorry if I was a...

20:55.200 --> 20:56.235
Listen to me...

20:59.200 --> 21:00.474
I'm going to leave Martin.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.192
I'm going to give you
the money for the cafe

21:04.000 --> 21:05.673
and I'm gonna go to fucking Finland.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.149
OK.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.349
Oh and...

21:19.160 --> 21:20.840
That is the coolest thing
you've ever done.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.080
I know.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.120
Thanks, Claire.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.629
Shall we...?

21:31.600 --> 21:32.600
We can try.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.640
I'll see you at the sexhibition?
- Yeah.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.070
L I
