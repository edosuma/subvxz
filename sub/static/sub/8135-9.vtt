00:02.669 --> 00:05.229
Michael, that car.
It could've been my twin.

00:05.305 --> 00:08.866
- It almost killed me.
- I am the Knight Automated Roving Robot.

00:08.942 --> 00:12.708
- How may I serve you?
- It is very dangerous for you and for KITT.

00:13.913 --> 00:16.848
Stop it! You'll kill him!

00:16.916 --> 00:20.079
I am warning you:
Change course at once.

00:20.153 --> 00:22.417
I am not in control, KARR.

00:28.094 --> 00:30.927
Get back! Get back!

00:42.709 --> 00:47.874
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:47.947 --> 00:49.938
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:04.124 --> 02:08.288
Huh? Huh?
Just like I said, Rev.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.421
This is the place.
I don't like this, Tony.

02:11.498 --> 02:15.332
"Thou shalt not trespass on thy
neighbor," or something like that.

02:15.401 --> 02:18.996
Rev, Rev, Rev. Don't start with
the Ten Commandment stuff again.

02:19.072 --> 02:23.839
Here. Have another slug. You'll
feel real warm and spiritual.

02:23.910 --> 02:29.644
We ain't gonna find nothin' in here. When a
zillionaire like Knight dies, they clean out the joint.

02:37.857 --> 02:40.348
Yeah. You see that?

02:40.426 --> 02:45.523
You think they got guards
around here for nothin'? Come on.

02:49.402 --> 02:52.769
If that guard comes back,
we'll take care of him.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.879
I got a bad feelin' about this.

02:59.946 --> 03:04.474
And I got a good one,
just like my horoscope said.

03:04.551 --> 03:09.079
Guys this rich, they got gold
and silver on their plumbing.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.417
Huh?

03:26.306 --> 03:29.571
Michael, do you realize
that it's 2:32 in the morning?

03:29.642 --> 03:32.042
This is no time
to perform an errand.

03:32.111 --> 03:37.572
KITT, we gotta secure the old laboratory. The city
takes possession of it first thing in the morning.

03:37.650 --> 03:41.450
Anyway, what's your problem, huh? Am I
keeping you from a hot date or somethin'?

03:41.521 --> 03:45.321
Of course not, but I need to
charge my power packs occasionally.

03:45.391 --> 03:49.259
And speaking of dates, we could've
performed this task this afternoon...

03:49.329 --> 03:51.524
if you hadn't
visited that Rosalie woman.

03:51.598 --> 03:56.092
It's Roselynn. Roselynn. Rosalie's the
other one. She lives down by the beach.

03:56.169 --> 04:00.401
Michael, why do you need to socialize with
so many women? Wouldn't one be sufficient?

04:00.473 --> 04:05.536
KITT, you're beginning to sound like my mother.
What's wrong with a little... companionship?

04:05.612 --> 04:09.309
- Huh? You can understand that.
- No, Michael. I cannot.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.613
When you're one of a kind,
companionship does not compute.

04:48.855 --> 04:52.621
Nothin'.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.886
Come on.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.969
Tony, look.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.338
Ah, that's just
to scare people away.

05:24.891 --> 05:29.385
Hey, this place is big.

05:29.462 --> 05:32.795
Let's go.

05:32.865 --> 05:37.768
Are you kiddin'?
It's a gold mine. Look. Wait.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.329
It's gone now.

05:41.407 --> 05:45.776
I think we should beat it.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.905
I think you're right.

05:56.823 --> 05:59.383
Oh, no, no. No.
Stop!

06:00.760 --> 06:03.058
No!

06:25.551 --> 06:27.781
Hello?

06:27.854 --> 06:30.584
Hello?

06:31.958 --> 06:34.392
That's funny.

06:35.461 --> 06:39.090
Funny? I detect no source
of amusement.

06:39.165 --> 06:42.430
No. I mean, there's supposed
to be a guard on duty.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.768
Come on, KITT.
Let's check it out, huh?

06:48.841 --> 06:53.141
- What's wrong? Didn't you hear me?
I said come on.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.848
- Michael, I'm getting some unusual readings.
- Readings of what?

07:01.921 --> 07:05.118
I don't know. They appear to be
sensor echoes of my own telemetry.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.989
But that's impossible.

07:08.060 --> 07:12.087
Buddy, if it's impossible,
ignore it. Come on.

07:15.535 --> 07:19.369
- Michael, I have a strange feeling about this.
- What are you talkin' about?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.875
- You don't have feelings.
- I know. That's what's strange about it.

07:24.110 --> 07:28.513
All right. Somethin' strange is goin' on.
I want you to stay out here and back me up.

07:29.582 --> 07:32.107
- Stay here, huh?
- You don't have to tell me twice.

08:28.307 --> 08:31.242
Lab three.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.541
Lab three.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.425
KITT, we gotta get this guy
to a hospital, buddy.

08:51.497 --> 08:55.900
Michael, that car. It could've been
my twin. It was exactly like me.

08:55.968 --> 09:01.338
Not exactly, buddy.
It almost killed me.

09:12.818 --> 09:16.515
That was the hospital.
The security guard is still unconscious,

09:16.589 --> 09:18.682
but he's out of danger,
I'm glad to say.

09:18.758 --> 09:22.592
- In an hour or two, he'll be able to give you a statement.
- I'll settle for a statement from you.

09:22.662 --> 09:25.062
- I beg your pardon?
- Why wasn't I told about the other car?

09:25.131 --> 09:28.032
- Oh, Michael, please.
- No "Michael, please." I had a right to know.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.432
Yes. Indeed you did.
Let me explain.

09:30.503 --> 09:34.496
Six months before we found you
in the desert, near to death,

09:34.574 --> 09:39.011
Wilton activated what was probably
the crowning invention of his life.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.638
KITT?
No. KARR.

09:41.714 --> 09:44.512
- K-A-R-R.
- What's KARR?

09:44.584 --> 09:49.817
The Knight Automated Roving Robot. That was
Wilton's title for his prototype vehicle.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.983
- I think I like KITT better.
- You can say that again.

09:53.059 --> 09:58.292
Now, KITT's primary function is to
serve you, to protect you from harm.

09:58.364 --> 10:01.333
The KARR, the earlier model,
had no such programming.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.699
Instead, its primary function
was self-preservation.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.136
- And that was a mistake?
- A major one.

10:07.206 --> 10:10.232
- Like not telling me about this whole thing?
- Don't look at me.

10:10.309 --> 10:13.710
- That was before my time.
- Consider the circumstances.

10:13.779 --> 10:17.545
Just as Wilton realized he'd made a mistake
by not programming KARR properly,

10:17.617 --> 10:21.485
his company was virtually toppled
from within by the very same people...

10:21.554 --> 10:23.681
who left you for dead
on that desert highway.

10:23.756 --> 10:27.852
As we struggled to save your life
and I attempted to build a safer car,

10:27.927 --> 10:31.090
the earlier model
was put in storage.

10:31.163 --> 10:35.691
I thought Wilton had had it dismantled
before he died, but I was wrong.

10:35.768 --> 10:37.861
Okay. I'm sorry.

10:37.937 --> 10:41.737
I still don't see how one simple computer
program can make all that much difference.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.742
Michael, KITT's primary function,
to protect human life,

10:44.810 --> 10:48.302
is, for want of a better word,
altruistic.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.349
But KARR,
without that programming,

10:50.416 --> 10:53.476
is self-serving,
almost animalistic in nature.

10:53.552 --> 10:56.316
Being devoid of a conscience,
it's potentially dangerous.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.381
If the people who now have it
misuse it,

10:59.458 --> 11:03.087
program it with information
it considers threatening,

11:03.162 --> 11:06.893
they could create a menace that could
quickly grow beyond their control.

11:08.934 --> 11:11.027
- Devon?
- Yes, Michael?

11:11.103 --> 11:14.436
- I think we should get that car back.
- So do I.

11:22.448 --> 11:26.851
- Are you awake?
- We're movin'. We're movin'. Movin'.

11:29.655 --> 11:31.782
Huh?

11:33.092 --> 11:35.788
It wasn't a dream.

11:35.861 --> 11:39.319
You're here. I'm here.
It's here.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.469
Wait a minute.
Wait-Wait a minute.

11:48.541 --> 11:53.808
- Where are we? - This is where
your companion told me to stop last night.

11:53.879 --> 11:57.815
- I did? - Actually, most of what
you said was incoherent.

11:57.883 --> 12:01.375
I did, however, distinctly
hear the word "stop."

12:01.454 --> 12:06.153
- You're just a car, ain't ya?
- Not just a car.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.750
I am the Knight
Automated Roving Robot.

12:08.828 --> 12:11.490
KARR, if you prefer.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.658
I am the prototype
of the car of the future.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.931
I mean, you're a regular...
real... thing,

12:18.003 --> 12:21.097
not just something
out of a nightmare,
like you looked last night.

12:21.173 --> 12:25.041
- Nothing has changed since last night.
- Oh, yeah.

12:25.111 --> 12:28.239
That's easy for you to say.

12:30.182 --> 12:35.142
Wh... Where did you come from, anyway,
and how did you get in that building?

12:35.221 --> 12:38.850
That edifice was the laboratory...

12:38.924 --> 12:41.290
where I was first activated...

12:41.360 --> 12:46.161
and where
I was also deactivated.

12:46.232 --> 12:50.100
Deactivated? You mean
somebody turned you off?

12:50.169 --> 12:53.764
My creator, Wilton Knight...

12:53.839 --> 12:57.275
He brought me into the world
and then turned on me.

12:57.343 --> 13:00.710
Aww. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.476
My old man... same way.

13:03.549 --> 13:07.007
Yeah. You can't count on
nobody 'cept me and Tony.

13:07.086 --> 13:12.353
Interesting. I will enter that
information in my data banks.

13:12.424 --> 13:16.622
I am indebted to both of you.
You have reactivated me.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.686
How may I serve you?

13:20.866 --> 13:24.825
Serve us?
What do you mean, serve us?

13:24.904 --> 13:28.897
I have checked my data
on basic human desires.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.909
Therefore,
I understand your needs.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.640
- Come on.
- You wish to eat?

13:35.714 --> 13:38.683
Well, yeah.

13:38.751 --> 13:41.311
- You wish to drink?
- Yeah.

13:41.387 --> 13:44.652
You wish to reproduce?
Yeah.

13:44.723 --> 13:47.590
Which one first?

13:47.660 --> 13:50.561
How 'bout a couple...
couple of eggs, sunny side up?

13:50.629 --> 13:54.224
I have no eggs. Perhaps you
can direct me to a chicken.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.530
Ah, what are you? A comedian?

13:56.602 --> 14:01.266
I am the Knight Automated Roving
Robot. KARR, if you prefer.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.571
I am the prototype
of the car of the future.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.237
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
It's comin' back to me. Last night,

14:07.313 --> 14:10.749
there was a guy
and another car just like you, huh?

14:10.816 --> 14:15.719
You are mistaken.
I am one of a kind.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.053
No, no, no. Rev's right.

14:19.124 --> 14:22.787
I saw it too.

14:22.862 --> 14:27.128
I am the prototype
of the car of the future.

14:27.199 --> 14:31.533
What you saw was merely
an inferior production line model,

14:31.604 --> 14:34.038
a pale copy of the original.

14:34.106 --> 14:37.837
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.708
You must be right, KARR.

14:40.779 --> 14:43.373
This guy
has got a touchy motor.

14:43.449 --> 14:47.385
Very well. Now,
may I take you somewhere for food?

14:50.322 --> 14:53.519
Well, yeah. Sure.
Why not?

15:03.135 --> 15:06.229
Do you wish to drive
or shall I?

15:06.305 --> 15:08.671
Go ahead.

15:15.247 --> 15:21.049
Far out. Far out.!

15:21.120 --> 15:23.611
It's a miracle.

15:23.689 --> 15:28.183
I detect numerous purveyors of food.
Please tell me where you wish to go.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.024
Uh, how about
the 3 Rings?

15:31.096 --> 15:35.624
It's over there on the right.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.778
When this guy wants to go
somewhere, he don't fool around.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.885
Ladies and gentlemen
and children of all ages,

15:53.953 --> 15:56.513
welcome to the center ring.

15:56.588 --> 16:00.854
The ringmaster is ready
for your order.

16:00.926 --> 16:04.054
- What is that voice?
- That's just the ringmaster, KARR.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.189
Ringmaster?
I scan no such person.

16:07.266 --> 16:11.464
I'll have, uh...
What'd they call that breakfast thing?

16:11.537 --> 16:14.973
This is a primitive remote
devoid of locomotion.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.407
I said, "The ringmaster is ready."

16:18.477 --> 16:20.775
Uh, the Tip-Top Ten?
No. That's not it.

16:20.846 --> 16:23.906
- Can I have your order, please?
- Tony, Rev,

16:23.983 --> 16:26.747
the operator of this device
must be nearby.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.912
Huh? What
are you talkin' about?

16:28.988 --> 16:31.183
You guys wanna snap it up?
I don't have all day.

16:31.256 --> 16:34.714
There. Did you hear?
He is becoming abusive.

16:34.793 --> 16:38.627
- You wise guys or what?
- Amazing. His anger grows.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.665
KARR, be quiet now. Please.

16:40.733 --> 16:44.499
All right. That's it. Come on. Get outta here
before I come out there and throw you out.

16:44.570 --> 16:49.007
- Ya hear me?
- Do not fear, my friends. I will protect you.

16:49.074 --> 16:51.508
Brace for collision.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.309
You're askin' for it.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.459
You see? Most of the interior
was empty.

17:11.530 --> 17:16.797
- It was a clever trick, my friends, but not clever enough.
- Come on! We gotta get outta here!

17:16.868 --> 17:20.805
But you haven't eaten yet.
Perhaps you wish to reproduce.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.536
- Forget that. Don't you hear the alarm?
- That harmonic disturbance?

17:24.609 --> 17:26.942
What does it mean?
It means the cops are comin'!

17:27.012 --> 17:29.378
- Is that a problem?
- Are you kiddin'?

17:29.448 --> 17:31.746
If the cops catch us,
they'll throw us in the slammer.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.445
- What is the slammer?
- You remember that room you were in?

17:34.520 --> 17:37.080
I will never forget it.

17:37.156 --> 17:40.614
Well, the slammer's just like that.
- I do not wish to go back to the slammer.

17:40.692 --> 17:46.289
- How may I avoid it? - You may get us out
of here as fast as you can, you stupid hunk of tin.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.408
Michael, I hope the security guard
has some answers for us.

17:58.477 --> 18:01.844
Those sensor echoes last night
were very puzzling.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.906
- Michael?
- Yeah, KITT? What is it?

18:04.983 --> 18:07.349
You're awfully quiet.
Is something bothering you?

18:07.419 --> 18:10.320
Yeah, buddy. Something is.
I'm a little worried about you.

18:10.389 --> 18:14.325
- About me?
- Yeah. This whole thing has been a bit of a shock, you know?

18:14.393 --> 18:17.556
Learning about another car.
Having to hunt it down.

18:17.629 --> 18:20.359
I mean, if I'm a little shook up,
I can imagine how you feel.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.993
Michael, really. By now
you should know me better than that.

18:24.069 --> 18:26.833
I admit that
I was somewhat surprised to discover...

18:26.905 --> 18:29.772
that I was not, in fact,
a prototype vehicle, but...

18:29.842 --> 18:32.538
There. You see?
You're upset.

18:32.611 --> 18:36.570
- It's gotta be a little blow to your ego, right?
- Not at all. On the contrary.

18:36.648 --> 18:40.516
It's a compliment. Instead
of being a problem-ridden prototype,

18:40.586 --> 18:43.555
I'm the new, improved model.

18:44.690 --> 18:48.148
Tony, slow down. Please!
Slow down?

18:48.227 --> 18:50.286
I'm not driving!

18:50.362 --> 18:53.422
- KARR, you gotta stop!
- Negative, Tony.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.525
I do not wish
to go back to the slammer.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.834
You and your big mouth!

19:12.050 --> 19:14.746
Attention all units!
Attention all units!

19:14.820 --> 19:18.654
Black Trans-Am reported
heading south on Vincente Street.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.817
Come on, KITT.
You can level with me.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.088
Weren't you even
a little bit annoyed when you found out...

19:23.162 --> 19:25.528
there was another car
and nobody told you?

19:25.597 --> 19:29.533
Michael, why should that be upsetting?
There's a perfectly reasonable explanation.

19:29.601 --> 19:35.437
- Oh, yeah? What? - Of course. I wasn't informed
due to the all-too-common problem of human error.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.711
- KITT, go to police frequency.
- Of course.

19:46.785 --> 19:50.881
Last seen
at 3 Ring drive-in restaurant,

19:50.956 --> 19:53.891
9211 Vincente Street.

19:56.461 --> 19:59.692
- Did you hear that?
- Okay. Let's go, buddy. The hospital can wait.

19:59.765 --> 20:04.202
I should think so. That other car is going
to give Trans-Am a terrible reputation.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.199
I have evaded our pursuers.

20:11.276 --> 20:15.440
- You may resume manual control now.
- Thanks a lot.

20:15.514 --> 20:18.779
First thing we do is
take these wheels back where we got 'em.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.910
I do not wish
to go back to the slammer.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.889
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
He's just kidding, KARR, honest.

20:26.959 --> 20:31.089
Uh, would you put it back
on that manual thing?

20:31.163 --> 20:33.495
Come on. You can
trust me and the Rev.

20:33.565 --> 20:39.470
Yes. That information
is in my data banks. I can trust you.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.735
Would you excuse us
for a minute, KARR?

20:46.845 --> 20:49.837
Uh, don't go away.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.720
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna talk to you.

20:59.791 --> 21:04.592
We could've ended up in jail today,
all for a lousy, mechanical ringmaster.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.589
I got two
outstanding warrants, Tony.

21:08.667 --> 21:13.866
I don't need no Wizard of Oz car puttin'
me behind the eight ball for nothing.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.033
Hey, Rev,
I'm with you all the way.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.545
You are?
Sure.

21:21.613 --> 21:26.277
If we're gonna walk on the edge, let's
do it for somethin' worthwhile, right?

21:26.351 --> 21:28.819
Not just the Tip-Top Tent.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.253
Come on, Tony. We were lucky
today. Next time, we gonna...

21:33.325 --> 21:36.453
Next time,
it's gonna be the same thing.

21:36.528 --> 21:39.053
Did you see the way
that car handled those cops?

21:39.131 --> 21:42.658
Those moves? Those turns?

21:42.734 --> 21:48.434
Rev, with this car,
we could go all the way.

21:48.507 --> 21:51.476
We could go for the...

21:51.543 --> 21:55.240
We could go
for the brass ring.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.545
Nothin' on this earth
could stop us.

22:00.419 --> 22:02.410
You and me?

22:17.235 --> 22:20.363
Excuse me. Tell me
what happened here.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.532
Is that your car?
Yes.

22:22.607 --> 22:25.838
Why do you ask? Was there
another car like mine here?

22:40.425 --> 22:42.393
I'm glad the commissioner
straightened things out.

22:42.461 --> 22:44.429
You can understand
the confusion.

22:44.496 --> 22:48.296
Maybe until we nail the stolen car,
you should paint yours another color.

22:48.367 --> 22:53.999
We'll take it under advisement,
Officer. Thank you so much.

22:54.072 --> 22:57.041
I hope you didn't take that suggestion
seriously, Mr. Miles.

22:57.109 --> 22:59.202
I am quite happy
with basic black.

22:59.277 --> 23:03.873
Look. Aren't we overreacting a bit here? All
these guys did was blow away a ringmaster.

23:03.949 --> 23:06.679
- They didn't even steal any hamburgers.
- Michael,

23:06.752 --> 23:10.813
KARR is like a loaded gun
in the hands of a small child.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.323
It's only a matter of time
before there's a real explosion.

23:13.392 --> 23:18.022
Bonnie, unless I'm mistaken, you seem
to be repositioning my main power booster.

23:18.096 --> 23:22.658
Uh, yes. I'm, um, making room
for a new component.

23:22.734 --> 23:27.330
- What kind of component?
- We don't know yet if it's going to be necessary, KITT.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.499
- Just planning ahead. That's all.
- I see.

23:29.574 --> 23:34.238
Michael, considering the confusion of the law
enforcement authorities regarding myself and KARR,

23:34.312 --> 23:37.611
I'll understand it if you want to work
without me until this crisis is over.

23:37.682 --> 23:41.243
No, buddy. That's okay.

23:41.319 --> 23:46.086
Remember. I had a lot of partners when I
was a cop. You're the best of any of' em.

23:46.158 --> 23:49.821
Thank you, Michael. I, of course,
make no such generalization about you.

23:49.895 --> 23:55.697
However, I project odds of 1,000 to one against
my meeting a more compatible human than yourself.

23:55.767 --> 24:00.534
Thanks, buddy. Okay, partner. You
got any ideas about that other car?

24:00.605 --> 24:04.769
- Maybe some chinks in the armor, huh?
- I have insufficient data to be certain, Michael.

24:04.843 --> 24:09.212
However, since KARR is as powerful
and as nearly indestructible as myself,

24:09.281 --> 24:11.806
Zeno's Paradoxes
should be a factor.

24:11.883 --> 24:17.014
- Zeno? - A Greek philosopher
and scientist. 335 to 263 B.C.

24:17.088 --> 24:20.023
- Very good, Mr. Miles.
- Thank you.

24:20.091 --> 24:24.892
Michael, Zeno first postulated a question
which my twin would certainly be aware of.

24:24.963 --> 24:29.297
To wit, what would happen if an
irresistible force met an immovable object?

24:29.367 --> 24:31.892
- What?
- I see what you mean.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.961
Well, so, KITT,
what's the answer?

24:34.039 --> 24:37.440
No one knows, Bonnie.
No one knows.

25:09.074 --> 25:14.068
Seven. Look at this!
Eight!

25:24.422 --> 25:27.516
I'm gonna buy me my own church.

25:47.712 --> 25:51.113
Again and again they've struck.

25:51.182 --> 25:57.052
The fact that nobody's been hurt is either a miracle or a
coincidence, but we can't assume a continuance of either.

25:57.122 --> 25:59.818
So what do we do now?
There's one approach, Michael,

25:59.891 --> 26:02.655
but it's very dangerous
for you and for KITT.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.662
- Go on.
- We all know that KITT and KARR...

26:05.730 --> 26:08.756
are made of a virtually
indestructible alloy.

26:08.833 --> 26:12.826
Hardly anything could
damage either car...
hardly anything.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.998
That is, except this.

26:17.509 --> 26:20.603
Whoa.
That's very interesting.

26:20.679 --> 26:24.171
It's a resonating laser, Michael. It's
powerful enough to send a burst of energy...

26:24.249 --> 26:27.912
directly into
KARR's only vulnerable spot:

26:27.986 --> 26:30.921
The front scanner here.

26:30.989 --> 26:35.050
The scanner is protected by an alloy
grill. Only a dead-on shot can work.

26:35.126 --> 26:38.687
Then the scanner will blow,
and with it, all of KARR's systems.

26:38.763 --> 26:42.665
It'll become an immobilized
hunk of metal. Bonnie.

26:54.679 --> 26:57.705
That's, uh...
That's very impressive.

26:57.782 --> 27:01.946
Well, it seems doable.

27:02.020 --> 27:06.150
Wait a minute.
Why all the long faces?

27:06.224 --> 27:09.955
To perform this task, Michael, you and
KITT must be directly in front of KARR.

27:10.028 --> 27:15.830
For maximum effect, you must fire the laser
at a distance no greater than 100 yards.

27:15.900 --> 27:19.859
And you must hold the laser
on target for at least two full seconds.

27:19.938 --> 27:22.270
Two seconds?

27:22.340 --> 27:24.774
A hundred yards?

27:24.843 --> 27:29.405
KITT and KARR can travel a
hundred yards in two seconds.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.075
Yes. That's the problem.

27:32.150 --> 27:36.382
By the way, the laser's
only good for two shots.

27:36.454 --> 27:39.252
Any more would
deplete KITT's batteries.

27:41.793 --> 27:45.695
Oh-la-la!

27:47.565 --> 27:51.501
- Welcome to Easy Street, amigo.
- Easy Street?

27:51.569 --> 27:53.730
It's automobile heaven,
right, KARR?

27:53.805 --> 27:56.672
I am unfamiliar
with your reference, Rev.

27:56.741 --> 27:59.904
However, there is no cause
for celebration.

27:59.978 --> 28:03.243
We have a problem.

28:05.917 --> 28:09.853
Problem?
Like, uh, what problem?

28:09.921 --> 28:12.856
I have analyzed
my self-monitors,

28:12.924 --> 28:16.189
and my beta and lambda circuits
are in need of realignment.

28:16.261 --> 28:22.200
Also, the fiber optics in my scanners
have suffered a 20 % reduction in opacity,

28:22.267 --> 28:24.929
probably due
to my long incarceration.

28:25.003 --> 28:27.437
- What do you want? A tune-up
or something? - Hardly.

28:27.505 --> 28:31.737
I require attention from an
experienced cybernetic technician.

28:31.810 --> 28:34.108
Cyber, uh, "nician"?

28:34.179 --> 28:38.172
Where do you find one of them? We
have seen a car similar to myself.

28:38.249 --> 28:41.150
Since I am the prototype,

28:41.219 --> 28:44.814
it is most likely an inferior
production line copy.

28:44.889 --> 28:48.882
However, someone
must own it...

28:48.960 --> 28:51.690
and, therefore, maintain it.

28:51.763 --> 28:56.166
By following this line of reasoning,
we can locate the individual...

28:56.234 --> 28:58.634
who cares for that other vehicle.

28:58.703 --> 29:02.161
Sure. Sure. I was
just gonna say that.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.006
Then you can get that person
and bring them here.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.307
We can't do that.
Why?

29:08.379 --> 29:11.610
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah. It's called kidnapping.

29:11.683 --> 29:16.814
I am unfamiliar with that term. I only
know that I require skilled maintenance.

29:16.888 --> 29:20.483
Uh...
You're, uh...

29:20.558 --> 29:24.426
You're gettin' a conscience kind
of late in the game, you know that?

29:24.496 --> 29:28.489
Tony, I know I'm no saint, but nothin'
we've done's hurt anybody so far.

29:28.566 --> 29:31.467
- You're talking about just grabbin' somebody
off the... - Okay, okay, okay, okay.

29:31.536 --> 29:34.937
Relax. Relax, relax, relax.

29:35.006 --> 29:39.602
So... we don't do it.
We don't?

29:39.677 --> 29:42.145
- But KARR just said...
- No. Leave it to me.

29:42.213 --> 29:46.946
It sounds good, but it's
about as smart as a toaster.

29:47.018 --> 29:51.045
I'll buy him some spark plugs.
He'll be real happy.

29:51.122 --> 29:56.458
Then, when he's in tip-top
shape, we pull one big job,

29:56.528 --> 30:00.692
and then... whoa, whoa, whoa...
then it's you and me...

30:00.765 --> 30:05.134
¢Ü Flyin' down to Rio
with you-o and me-o ¢Ü

30:05.203 --> 30:08.695
Huh? Huh?
What do you say?

30:08.773 --> 30:11.173
Okay. Okay.
I like that.

30:11.242 --> 30:13.540
Okay. Okay.

30:13.611 --> 30:16.546
Now, you get some rest.

30:16.614 --> 30:19.811
I'll go break the news
to motormouth.

30:30.261 --> 30:35.164
Okay, KARR.
You want a technician,

30:35.233 --> 30:38.259
I'll get you a technician.

30:38.336 --> 30:43.865
Once the laser is calibrated, Michael,
you or KITT can fire it quite easily.

30:43.942 --> 30:46.570
As you see, the triggering
mechanism is quite simple.

30:46.644 --> 30:51.172
I don't know what bothers me more: The fact that this
is a long shot or that I'm stupid enough to do it.

30:51.249 --> 30:54.218
The security system.

30:55.286 --> 30:57.948
- KITT, where are you?
- I'm in your parking space, Michael.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.923
- Where else would I be?
- Meet me at the main building. Something's up.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.756
Very well.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.296
Hello. What the devil's
going on?

31:06.364 --> 31:09.231
We tried to stop it, Mr. Miles,
but it ran the main gate.

31:09.300 --> 31:12.326
- What ran the main gate?
- The car, Mr. Miles. The car.

31:12.403 --> 31:14.428
The car.

31:14.505 --> 31:18.601
Security, this is Dr. Barstow.
What's happening with the alarm system?

31:25.984 --> 31:30.284
- KITT, where are you, buddy? Come on.
- There he is!

31:34.058 --> 31:36.288
That's not KITT!

31:41.900 --> 31:45.495
- KARR, get rid of this guy.
- Very well.

31:56.414 --> 32:01.215
KITT, KARR was here!
It's got Bonnie and Michael!

32:01.286 --> 32:05.120
- That way!
- Well done, Mr. Miles. I'll take it from here.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.927
Michael... Michael,
I'm on my way. Hang on.

32:12.997 --> 32:16.023
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

32:16.100 --> 32:20.002
Stop it! You'll kill him!

32:20.071 --> 32:25.668
- KARR, somebody's behind us.
- Yes. I see. It is the inferior production line copy.

32:25.743 --> 32:29.611
I heard that, KARR,
and you haven't seen anything yet.

32:31.316 --> 32:34.285
Michael, I'm in position.
Get ready to jump.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.559
Okay, KITT,
let's pour it on!

33:16.327 --> 33:21.060
You waste your time, my twin.
You cannot triumph over a prototype.

33:21.132 --> 33:24.124
Desist your pursuit.
You will be damaged.

33:24.202 --> 33:28.036
KARR, I didn't know you cared.

33:29.474 --> 33:33.501
KARR, perhaps you should be a little
more careful and a lot less belligerent.

33:37.782 --> 33:40.444
Michael, we're
approaching a residential neighborhood.

33:40.518 --> 33:44.579
We dare not continue this chase.
Innocent people may be harmed.

33:46.090 --> 33:49.526
- Look out!
- Oh, no!

34:06.310 --> 34:10.268
- Anything? - No, Michael.
Except for that brief reading on the other highway,

34:10.348 --> 34:12.578
I have no indication
of KARR.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.210
All right. Let's try a new direction.
How's the laser holdin'up?

34:15.286 --> 34:18.119
It's a rather tight fit,
but otherwise, it's fine.

34:18.188 --> 34:21.716
I must point out that it cannot be
fired until it is properly calibrated,

34:21.793 --> 34:23.987
and Bonnie's the only one
who can do that.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.087
She'll take care of it
when we find her.

34:26.164 --> 34:30.396
- You mean if we find her.
- No. I mean when we find her.

34:30.467 --> 34:33.630
Think positive, KITT.
Just keep thinkin' positive.

34:47.485 --> 34:50.283
Do not attempt
to sabotage me again.

34:50.353 --> 34:56.156
- I will defend myself.
- He means it, sweetheart.

34:57.328 --> 35:00.320
- You want some, babe?
- No, thanks.

35:00.398 --> 35:02.332
Even Michael Knight
wouldn't eat that stuff.

35:02.400 --> 35:06.530
- Who's Michael Knight?
- When you find out, you'll wish you never asked.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.936
Ha. Well.

35:13.778 --> 35:17.236
Hey, Tony, I thought you said
you didn't like talk...

35:17.315 --> 35:20.375
- Who is she?
- Rev, look at this.

35:20.451 --> 35:24.615
You kidnapped her, didn't you? You lied
to me, and you still went out and did it.

35:24.689 --> 35:27.590
Rev, come here.
Look. Look, will you?

35:27.658 --> 35:30.422
I want you
to look at this.

35:30.495 --> 35:34.431
- This is the big score.
- I don't care about a big score! This has gone too far now, Tony!

35:34.499 --> 35:38.026
- Here. Come here. - KARR, I didn't
check your video system. Do you mind?

35:38.102 --> 35:40.570
You have permission.

35:43.908 --> 35:47.867
Will you knock off that stuff, Rev?

35:47.945 --> 35:50.937
If you're so pure and all...

36:03.161 --> 36:06.096
Michael, I've just
picked up a strong reading.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.327
One of KARR's sensor devices
has just been activated.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.767
We need to make two more circuits
of the area to triangulate it, Michael.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.772
You've got it.

36:17.975 --> 36:20.239
You're not the man
I used to know, Tony.

36:20.311 --> 36:23.678
It's that car that changed
ya. It's the car. Rev...

36:23.748 --> 36:26.239
You know what Lucifer did
up in heaven before he fell?

36:26.317 --> 36:28.376
Don't start that holy stuff
with me again, Rev!

36:28.452 --> 36:31.387
Strong drink
made me fall from grace.

36:31.455 --> 36:35.516
I didn't change! He made a machine,
Tony... An infernal machine!

36:35.593 --> 36:39.359
And we gotta stop that machine before it's
too late! The police'll know what to do.

36:39.430 --> 36:43.799
- Yo, yo. What's this police stuff?
- Man.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.598
Let go of me, Tony.
It's for our own good!

36:46.671 --> 36:48.798
Like hell!
What about all the money?

36:48.873 --> 36:53.367
I don't care about the money!
I care about your immortal soul, Tony!

37:12.563 --> 37:15.327
You hunk of tin,
didn't you see her?

37:15.399 --> 37:18.300
I was watching you
deactivate the Rev.

37:18.369 --> 37:21.805
Was he malfunctioning?

37:44.829 --> 37:47.457
Michael, what kept you?

37:47.531 --> 37:49.897
Get back! Get back!

37:54.672 --> 37:57.903
He jumped his buddy. We should call
an ambulance. We can do it on the way.

37:57.975 --> 38:01.001
- On the way to where? - To the gems for
the museum exhibit. That's where they're headed.

38:27.605 --> 38:30.233
- Devon, this is Michael.
- Michael, did you find Bonnie? Is she...

38:30.308 --> 38:34.540
She's fine. She's with me now, but KARR is going
after the gems of the new exhibit for the museum.

38:34.612 --> 38:37.638
Jewels for the exhibit?
They'd still be in the county warehouse.

38:37.715 --> 38:40.479
I'll meet you there
with reinforcements.

38:40.551 --> 38:42.542
Okay.

39:36.941 --> 39:39.205
- Are we too late?
- They're still inside.

39:48.319 --> 39:51.049
Beautiful, huh, sweetheart?

40:05.970 --> 40:08.768
- KITT, you ready?
- Aren't I always?

40:08.839 --> 40:11.899
All right, Bonnie. I think
you'd better get out.

40:11.976 --> 40:14.843
Like hell, Michael. This laser
has never been calibrated,

40:14.912 --> 40:17.710
and I'm the only one
that can fire it that way.

40:17.782 --> 40:20.148
- Even KITT can't do it.
- She's right, Michael.

40:20.217 --> 40:23.584
Ah, you always
liked her better.

40:49.580 --> 40:52.344
That thing ready?
It's almost calibrated.

40:52.416 --> 40:55.283
KITT, keep him talkin;

40:55.352 --> 40:58.549
KARR, please desist from your actions.
Many people may be hurt.

40:58.622 --> 41:03.616
- That is no concern of mine.
- Aw, forget the family reunion. Get outta here!

41:03.694 --> 41:07.425
This conversation is non-productive.

41:19.577 --> 41:23.206
Michael, Bonnie, my analysis of
KARR's movements leads me to believe...

41:23.280 --> 41:26.511
he is maneuvering for a long enough
run to leap over the police barricade.

41:26.584 --> 41:29.178
Come on, Bonnie. Come on.
Come on. You ready? Come on.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.187
Almost.

41:31.255 --> 41:34.588
- Hey, hey. What are you doin'?
- I must eliminate excess weight.

41:43.601 --> 41:46.536
Oh, no.
The calibration must be off.

41:48.806 --> 41:52.242
Okay. We'll
try another pass. Let's go!

42:01.085 --> 42:04.054
Right now!

42:05.356 --> 42:08.416
That's our last shot.

42:12.429 --> 42:14.954
You're not going after him?

42:15.032 --> 42:18.001
You wanna bet?

42:18.068 --> 42:20.935
- He's gone.
- KITT, scan for him, buddy.

42:21.005 --> 42:24.236
Already scanning, Michael.
KARR is taking the coastal road north.

42:24.308 --> 42:26.606
I-90 North goes the same way.
We'll cut him off.

42:39.657 --> 42:42.717
Michael, you're putting us
on a collision course with KARR.

42:42.793 --> 42:45.455
I noticed that too, Bonnie.
Michael, what are you doing?

42:45.529 --> 42:50.125
We're gonna stop that car
one way or another.

42:57.875 --> 43:00.844
Michael, I should point out
that KARR may be planning to ambush us.

43:00.911 --> 43:04.745
I know that, KITT,
but we gotta try, buddy.

43:04.815 --> 43:07.147
We gotta try.

43:33.911 --> 43:37.108
KITT, I am warning you:
Change course at once.

43:37.181 --> 43:42.710
- I am not in control, KARR.
- Then tell the humans to turn away. This is folly, KITT.

43:42.786 --> 43:44.310
- He's right.
- He's right.

43:44.388 --> 43:46.618
- No way.
- Michael, what are you doing?

43:46.690 --> 43:49.250
Remember Zeno
and that immovable object thing?

43:49.326 --> 43:54.059
- We're about to find out the answer.
- Your lives mean nothing to me.

43:54.131 --> 43:58.158
Michael, please. Pardon the expression,
but he does have a few screws loose.

43:58.235 --> 44:02.137
Turn. KARR doesn't have my
programming to protect human life.

44:02.206 --> 44:04.902
That's what I'm countin' on, buddy.
What?

44:04.975 --> 44:09.173
Michael, I cannot allow you to jeopardize
your life. I am assuming control.

44:09.246 --> 44:12.238
No, you're not, KITT!

44:12.316 --> 44:17.049
Michael, you know all those times I've called
you irresponsible and impulsive? I didn't mean it.

44:17.121 --> 44:20.352
Bonnie, remember all those times
I called you bossy and demanding?

44:20.424 --> 44:23.416
- I didn't mean it either.
- Michael. Bonnie.

44:23.494 --> 44:27.396
- Yes, KITT?
- Why are you lying to each other?

44:27.464 --> 44:30.991
Turn away. Turn away.

44:37.741 --> 44:39.208
No! No!

44:43.080 --> 44:47.278
Whoo!

44:59.496 --> 45:02.021
Now that things are back to normal.

45:02.099 --> 45:05.500
And at what a cost.
All that destruction.

45:05.569 --> 45:07.901
Not to mention
Zeno's Paradox...

45:07.971 --> 45:11.065
could go unanswered
for 2,000 years.

45:11.141 --> 45:13.075
I have a question about that, Michael.

45:13.143 --> 45:18.137
What made you so sure that KARR would turn away
first? How did you know you wouldn't, uh...

45:18.215 --> 45:21.275
- Chicken out?
- Thank you, Bonnie. Yes, Michael.

45:21.351 --> 45:23.319
How did you know
you wouldn't chicken out first?

45:23.387 --> 45:25.412
You provided that clue, KITT.

45:25.489 --> 45:28.583
You kept tellin' me how you two
differed in your basic programming.

45:28.659 --> 45:33.153
Yours is to protect human life,
but KARR's was self-preservation.

45:33.230 --> 45:38.133
So, in head-to-head confrontation,
KARR would always chicken out.

45:38.202 --> 45:41.660
- Eloquently put.
- Michael, I'm speechless.

45:41.739 --> 45:46.005
- A likely story. - No. Really. Michael,
your logic, in this case, is totally illogical,

45:46.076 --> 45:48.010
and yet it's absolutely correct.

45:48.078 --> 45:52.811
- This is just amazing. - No, KITT.
It's just human. Here's to KITT, huh?

45:52.883 --> 45:55.317
- To KITT.
- To KITT.

45:57.788 --> 46:01.622
What do you say you and I go out for a
drive, huh? Little celebration of our own.

46:01.692 --> 46:06.686
Get you a car wash. A little wax. Hey, I'll
let you beat me at chess again. What do you say?

46:06.764 --> 46:09.324
Thank you, Michael,
but it has been a draining day.

46:09.399 --> 46:12.664
- My power packs could use a rest.
- Okay, pal.

46:12.736 --> 46:16.638
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night, KITT.

46:16.707 --> 46:18.800
Good-bye.

46:18.876 --> 46:23.711
Oh, yeah. How does it feel
to be one of a kind again?

46:23.781 --> 46:28.275
As you know, Michael, I do not have feelings.
However, for want of a better expression,

46:28.352 --> 46:31.788
being one of a kind
is a very familiar feeling.

46:31.855 --> 46:35.621
Right.
Good night, buddy.

46:37.361 --> 46:41.593
Being one of a kind
is a very familiar feeling.

47:02.386 --> 47:06.345
Michael Knight, a lone crusader
in a dangerous world,

47:06.423 --> 47:09.449
the world of the Knight Rider.
