WEBVTT

01:13.674 --> 01:15.347
Let's go.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.138
- Taylor. Bob and Marianne Taylor.
- Just bear with me one second.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.740
- There are other hotels in Miami.
- I'm sorry.

02:18.806 --> 02:22.720
What is the problem here? We made
these reservations over six months ago.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.279
- I know, I'm just not seeing it.
- Where's Lisa?

02:25.346 --> 02:27.883
- Lisa always takes care of us.
- She's out of town.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.121
- Her grandmother passed away.
- Cynthia?

02:30.184 --> 02:32.130
- Yes?
- Would you get in more trouble

02:32.186 --> 02:35.724
if you bothered her
or if I called corporate?

02:35.789 --> 02:37.860
OK.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.174
Damn! Dallas drivers!

02:42.229 --> 02:44.835
Who taught you how to drive?
Stevie Wonder?

02:44.899 --> 02:47.846
- You'll catch your plane. You got...
- Ten minutes.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.506
- Lisa Reisert.
- Lisa? Hi.

02:51.572 --> 02:55.042
I'm so sorry to call, but I didn't
know what to do. I have a situation.

02:55.109 --> 02:58.318
- Slow down. What's the problem?
- Bob and Marianne Taylor.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.915
Yep. They're regulars.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.961
Yeah, well, I think I sort of
erased their reservation.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.997
I was never checked out
on this system.

03:05.052 --> 03:08.829
Did I mention I had a confirmed
reservation? This is my receipt.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.335
I downloaded it off the Internet myself.

03:11.392 --> 03:14.236
- I know, Mrs. Taylor, calm down.
- Don't say that. No...

03:14.295 --> 03:16.172
- Calm down?
- She told me to calm down.

03:16.230 --> 03:20.542
Don't tell us to calm down.
We've been very calm right up until now.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.548
- I'm so sorry. Lisa?
- Cynthia, tell them one more minute,

03:23.604 --> 03:27.051
- they'll be happy, you promise.
- One more minute. You'll be happy.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.643
- I promise.
- We better be.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.815
Now, enter my PIN.
It's 7-8-8... Hang on.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.954
- Dad? Hold on.
- Lisa?

03:34.014 --> 03:36.153
- Can you hold on?
- Sure.

03:36.217 --> 03:39.562
OK, it's 7-8-8-4-underscore-L-Reisert.

03:39.620 --> 03:43.193
- Lisa, I'm so sorry for calling.
- No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.168
- Are you logged in yet?
- What do I do?

03:45.226 --> 03:48.469
Click on the Crisis folder,
you'll see a list of empty rooms,

03:48.529 --> 03:51.510
give 'em fourth-floor,
comp 'em for tonight and tomorrow.

03:51.565 --> 03:56.071
OK, just a sec. OK, you are all set.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.412
The first two nights
are gonna be on us.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.180
And if you need anything else,
just let me know.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.949
We won't.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.751
This is not my fault.

04:05.179 --> 04:08.126
God, they totally threw me.
They were such assholes.

04:08.182 --> 04:11.322
There are no assholes.
Only guests with special needs.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.730
- Here we are.
- Keep it. Anything else?

04:14.788 --> 04:18.065
The Simpsons didn't get
the California King they requested.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.126
What else?

04:20.461 --> 04:22.532
- Oh, my God.
- Tell me.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.406
Security left a message
saying the Charles Keefe party

04:25.466 --> 04:27.810
will be arriving
at 5:30am instead of pm.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.474
That's not that unusual.
It's a security thing.

04:30.537 --> 04:34.383
Make sure our guys have the entrance
set, his security takes it from there.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.887
Is Mr. Keefe Platinum Club
or something or...?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.617
Political. Homeland Security.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.785
Make sure there's a box
of Montecristo Cubans in the room

04:41.849 --> 04:44.659
and a bottle of Cristal on ice.
It's 3825.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.289
- OK. Got it covered. Safe flight.
- Thanks.

04:49.323 --> 04:52.202
Attention passengers
leaving on flight 1387.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.603
- Lisa Reisert.
- I'm still here.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.232
Dad, I'm so sorry.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.477
- It's fine, sweetie.
- What's up?

04:59.533 --> 05:02.776
Gearin' up for another sleepless night
with a comedy marathon.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.578
Before I forget,

05:05.639 --> 05:07.915
that book I gave you,
you finish it yet?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.545
Almost.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.515
You know, he's from Texas.
I didn't think shrinks came from there.

05:13.580 --> 05:17.289
Yeah, they do. They just move
to California and start TV shows.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.262
- How's the remodeling?
- Good. Good.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.197
They made headway
in the last few days.

05:21.255 --> 05:24.702
I lost my wallet, but that's par
for the course. It's lookin' good.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.601
That's good.
I can't wait to see it.

05:26.660 --> 05:31.473
You should. The upstairs hallway
is totally unrecognizable.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.103
- Your room hasn't been touched.
- No, Dad.

05:34.168 --> 05:37.274
Please, go nuts, make it
into a gym or a putting green.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.340
You know I can't do that.

05:39.406 --> 05:43.081
You never know when you might just
wanna spend a few nights back here.

05:43.143 --> 05:47.216
You know? Make an escape
from the day-to-day.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.693
Day-to-day, it's where I thrive.
You know that.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.194
Right.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.190
So,

05:56.256 --> 06:00.204
- how's your mom holdin' up?
- As good as can be expected.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.874
You? What about you?
You all right?

06:02.930 --> 06:05.171
- Yep, I'm fine.
- You sure?

06:06.300 --> 06:10.646
Everything's fine, Dad. You're gonna
have to start takin' my word for it.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.581
Look, I gotta go. I gotta check in.

06:12.639 --> 06:15.085
You sure you don't need a pickup?

06:15.142 --> 06:18.885
- I thought you lost your wallet.
- Leese, it's just five minutes.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.392
I'm taking the red-eye.
It's the last flight.

06:21.448 --> 06:23.894
It's gonna be late.
I love you. I'll call you.

06:23.951 --> 06:27.125
- I love you too, sweetie.
- OK, bye.

06:31.225 --> 06:35.230
Attention. We have a cancellation
update. Flight 1192 has been canceled.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.342
Anybody who was on the flight
to Atlanta that was canceled,

06:42.403 --> 06:45.213
come to the front of the line
so we can reroute you.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.047
Flight 1019 to Miami...

06:48.442 --> 06:50.786
- I'm sorry.
- Don't sweat it.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.585
I'm wearing my combat boots.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.561
- Excuse me?
- Travel is war these days.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.062
Yeah.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.360
I just love him.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.130
How is that? Are you learning a lot?

07:04.191 --> 07:05.795
I'm not really sure.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.097
He's so handsome.

07:08.162 --> 07:11.234
I work during the day
so I always miss his shows.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.835
Flight 247 to Cleveland
has been delayed.

07:13.901 --> 07:17.246
- Here. That'll catch you up.
- Oh, no. No, no, I... I couldn't.

07:17.304 --> 07:20.979
I'm finished. My Dad's given me so
many, I could start a library. Please.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.545
- That's very nice of you.
- Once again anyone who is scheduled

07:24.611 --> 07:28.024
on the flight to Atlanta, if you
wanna get out of Dallas tonight,

07:28.081 --> 07:30.561
come to the front
of the line at this time.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.858
Excuse me.
You're letting them go,

07:32.920 --> 07:35.992
but we've been standing
for an hour? How does that happen?

07:36.056 --> 07:38.229
If we don't re-book,
they miss their flight.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.739
It doesn't matter that you
canceled my flight then rerouted?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.776
- I understand.
- Get your boss. This is ridiculous!

07:44.832 --> 07:47.608
Don't make her do that.
She's doing the best she can.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.443
I don't think I was talking to you

07:49.503 --> 07:51.244
- I realize that...
- I'm trying...

07:51.305 --> 07:53.285
Please, sir.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.583
She is the one standing
between us getting out and anarchy.

07:56.643 --> 08:00.216
- Yeah, but she's not the one in...
- She's exhausted, worked 18 hours,

08:00.280 --> 08:02.988
and she suspects we all hate her
just as much as you do.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.963
What do you say we give her a break?
Let her get back to a job

08:06.019 --> 08:09.967
I'm guessing is a lot
more thankless than yours.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.171
This airline sucks.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.045
Next in line, please.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.808
That's me.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.508
Here.

08:25.973 --> 08:29.182
Thank you very much.
And thank you.

08:29.243 --> 08:30.551
You're welcome.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.285
Yeah. Thank you.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.327
Not at all.
That was just backup.

08:35.382 --> 08:38.056
- You got the ball rolling.
- Yeah.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.359
- Reflex, I guess.
- Why is that?

08:40.420 --> 08:43.993
I work in a hotel. I deal
with people like that all the time.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.336
The Marriott? The Hilton?

08:47.394 --> 08:49.738
- The Lux Atlantic It's in...
- Miami.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.833
- Right. I know it well.
- Yeah.

08:51.899 --> 08:55.574
- So you're on this...
- Very delayed flight to Miami. Yeah.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.207
- You?
- Yeah. Sadly, yeah.

08:58.272 --> 09:01.685
But you know what? That's
why God created the Tex-Mex.

09:01.742 --> 09:05.952
The best nachos in the airport
and right across from our gate.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.391
Good tip. Thanks.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.360
Save you a seat.

09:15.656 --> 09:19.160
Yeah, that was... I thought
since we're on the same flight...

09:19.226 --> 09:21.968
I didn't mean to invade
your personal space or...

09:22.029 --> 09:24.407
- No.
- I can take you over here.

09:24.464 --> 09:28.640
- I just... I have a few calls to make.
- Sure. I understand. You go ahead.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.740
- Have a good flight.
- OK. You too.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.376
We will be updating you
with the departure time

09:34.441 --> 09:37.115
of flight 1019
with service to Miami...

09:37.177 --> 09:39.555
- Hi.
- Hi. You must be Rebecca.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.217
- Yes.
- Well, my name's Mary,

09:41.281 --> 09:44.353
and I hear this is the first time
you're flying by yourself.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.024
Well, you must be very brave.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.794
- Are you gonna be OK?
- Yes, Mom.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.267
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

09:51.325 --> 09:54.431
- I'm just asking.
- I'm 11, not nine.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.667
Come with me, you two.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.537
There you go, sir.
Your nachos. Careful, hot plate.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.171
Thank you, sir.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.943
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.543
- It's iced. Don't worry.
- OK.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.215
- Let me find you napkins.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.757
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.724
OK. Larry,

10:14.781 --> 10:17.728
could you run back to Starbucks?
I need another mocha.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.390
- Finish that one already?
- Someone's wearin' it.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.661
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention.

10:22.723 --> 10:26.865
Flight number 17 leaving Dallas
National Airport from gate two

10:26.927 --> 10:29.430
will be delayed for 20 minutes.

10:52.119 --> 10:55.259
Paging a skycap with
electric cart to gate four.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.792
Paging a skycap with
electric cart to gate four.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.433
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.707
- Is this taken?
- No, it's all yours.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.268
Thanks.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.110
So did you get your calls made?

11:11.271 --> 11:12.978
Yep. No more calls.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.179
Good. What will you have?

11:17.344 --> 11:20.086
- No, it's... I'm OK.
- If I can guess...

11:21.448 --> 11:22.552
OK.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.830
I'm feeling vodka.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.292
Definitely sweetened.

11:30.357 --> 11:34.271
Cosmo. Way too common.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.698
Screwdriver.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.869
No. No. No. Way too boring.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.971
So that leaves me with the
simplicity of the grapefruit

11:43.036 --> 11:46.381
or the complexity of the pineapple.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.218
Grapefruit sea breeze.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.693
- Could I have a bay breeze?
- You got it.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.023
Thanks.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.758
It's an impressive talent, though.
Very close.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.699
- You know, breaks the ice.
- Yeah.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.498
- So are you headed home?
- Yeah. Trying.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.539
Yeah. Flying's so
much fun these days.

12:07.594 --> 12:11.167
Fun for me is just getting off
that plane in one piece.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.769
- Fear of flying?
- Yeah. Just a little.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.837
Were you in Texas
on hotel business?

12:16.903 --> 12:19.406
No. My grandmother died.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.420
It's OK. She was 91.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.957
- Ninety-one.
- Yeah.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.458
That's respectable.
What was her secret?

12:28.515 --> 12:31.428
Grape-Nuts. And a guy named Duke.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.522
Excuse me?

12:33.587 --> 12:38.263
Yeah, she said the Grape-Nuts
kept her arteries clean

12:38.325 --> 12:41.829
and Duke helped with the rest.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.208
Wow. A dynamic woman.

12:46.266 --> 12:50.214
Nothing fazed her, you know?
She was so optimistic.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.017
"Always look forward."

12:53.073 --> 12:54.552
That's what she'd say

12:54.608 --> 12:57.350
- There ya go.
- Thanks.

12:58.812 --> 13:01.486
...heightened security
measures are now in place.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.928
- That taste OK?
- It's fine.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.897
You sure? 'Cause we can
always get you that sea breeze.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.433
You sound like my dad.
I say I'm fine,

13:09.489 --> 13:12.470
he says, "Are you sure?" I'm sure.

13:12.526 --> 13:15.473
- OK, I believe you.
- Good.

13:15.529 --> 13:18.100
- The name's Jackson, by the way.
- Lisa.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.406
- Pleased to meet you.
- Is it Jack for short?

13:20.467 --> 13:24.108
No, I haven't gone by Jack
since I was ten years old.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.948
Last name's Rippner.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.843
Jack Rippner.

13:28.909 --> 13:32.118
Jack... the...

13:32.179 --> 13:33.783
- There you go.
- OK.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.259
- That wasn't very nice of your parents.
- No.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.297
That's what I told 'em
before I killed 'em.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.353
What?

13:42.222 --> 13:45.669
Well, if it's any comfort,
my middle name's Henrietta.

13:45.725 --> 13:46.965
Henrietta.

13:47.027 --> 13:50.031
But that's my
grandma's name, though.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.073
Was.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.737
Well, here's to Henrietta,
whose spirit is very much alive.

14:11.718 --> 14:12.719
What?

14:13.486 --> 14:16.467
I'm tellin' you, man,
she was tasty.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.401
And now let's go
to Washington for an update.

14:21.461 --> 14:25.238
As the war on terrorism escalates,
Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security

14:25.298 --> 14:28.802
Charles Keefe embarks on a seven-day
tour of Southern port cities,

14:28.869 --> 14:31.941
starting tomorrow. You may
recall that four months ago,

14:32.005 --> 14:35.475
Keefe sent shockwaves through
the department after he made remarks

14:35.542 --> 14:37.544
during his first press conference.

14:37.611 --> 14:41.718
I don't discriminate, I communicate.
Just not always with a kind word.

14:41.781 --> 14:45.092
Now, don't get me wrong,
I believe in diplomacy.

14:45.151 --> 14:49.691
It can work. But first
you have to have their attention.

14:51.091 --> 14:55.597
Do I have your attention?
Thank you. Thank you very much.

14:55.662 --> 15:00.304
We're cleared for the boarding of
flight 1019, service to Miami, Florida.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.181
- I guess that's us.
- Wonders never cease.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.485
Yeah.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.891
- Let me get this.
- Oh, no. No. Please.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.554
I got it. I got it.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.461
- Yeah. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.897
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.626
Well...

15:23.690 --> 15:25.397
Report unattended baggage

15:25.458 --> 15:29.565
- to airport security. Thank you.
- Can you hang on? I'm sorry.

15:29.629 --> 15:33.236
Hello? Yeah.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.338
Can you just hold on?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.875
I gotta take this.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.179
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.015
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.214
- Have a good flight. Bye-bye.
- You too.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.620
Bye.

15:45.679 --> 15:48.387
Hey. Yeah, looks like
we're gettin' outta here.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.622
The storm's moved on.
No, there's time.

15:51.685 --> 15:55.130
- Thank you for your patience, sir. - Yeah, right.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.869
Come on, we gotta move it, bro.
Come on.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.733
- You made it, boys.
- Yeah. Just barely.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.539
Thank you. Bye-bye.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.101
Here we go.

16:10.837 --> 16:13.579
- Thank you. Enjoy.
- Thanks.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.677
There you go.
Thanks for your patience.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.313
5-A is to your right.
Enjoy your flight. Hello.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.984
- Hi.
-18-G. Down the aisle to your left.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.084
- Thank you.
- Thanks for your patience.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.594
- How are you?
- Better now.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.153
- Sorry for the delay.
- 21-F.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.460
- 21-F is right down...
- Yeah. Thank you.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.501
Hi, how are you?

16:32.926 --> 16:35.304
We're going to dim the lighting

16:35.362 --> 16:39.333
for tonight's flight. Lights can be
activated by the button on your armrest.

16:39.399 --> 16:42.505
Once we've reached cruising altitude
and the captain turns off

16:42.569 --> 16:45.948
the fasten seat belt sign,
we will be offering our beverage service

16:46.006 --> 16:48.509
with complimentary soft drinks,
juice and coffee.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.953
- I'll help.
- Cocktails available for a charge.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.615
Thank you

16:56.182 --> 16:57.889
Hi.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.828
Again.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.457
- I figured you'd be in first class.
- No, not me.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.798
- I'm all coach, all the time.
- Me too.

17:04.858 --> 17:09.534
Yeah. I think that's my seat.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.509
- What, you're not sitting here.
- Well, I don't know.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.875
- That says 18-6?
- You're kidding.

17:14.934 --> 17:18.177
You're not kidding.
You need a bellhop?

17:18.238 --> 17:21.515
- No, no, no. That's OK.
- Let me help. I insist.

17:23.576 --> 17:24.919
- You OK?
- Yeah.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.548
- You sure? OK.
- Yeah.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.059
I'm not normally such a lightweight.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.559
Those were strong bay breezes.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.463
Well, I'm cutting you off anyways,
all right?

17:39.993 --> 17:42.530
So... What are the odds?

17:42.595 --> 17:45.201
Yeah, I know.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.544
Wait a minute.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.706
You're not stalking me, are you?

17:52.272 --> 17:53.273
No.

17:58.812 --> 18:00.951
- You got me.
- I'm sorry.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.461
- Oh, jeez.
- You all right?

18:05.518 --> 18:08.692
If I say yes,
are you gonna ask me if I'm sure?

18:08.755 --> 18:11.668
No. No. That's your dad's department.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.161
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

18:14.227 --> 18:17.538
Earlier today I had
some cheap wine at the funeral,

18:17.597 --> 18:20.134
and combined with the cheap vodka...

18:20.200 --> 18:23.340
- I see.
- I blame you for that part.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.213
- Well, I feel terrible now.
- You should.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.683
Oh, I do.

18:27.740 --> 18:31.711
We know it's been a long night, so stow
your belongings and take your seats

18:31.778 --> 18:34.520
as quickly as possible,
we'll be underway. Thank you.

18:34.581 --> 18:37.585
- I think somebody needs a bellhop.
- Excuse me.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.857
OK.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.525
<i>Let me.</i>

18:45.291 --> 18:47.828
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

18:47.894 --> 18:51.637
Just when I thought there
weren't any gentlemen left.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.501
You have a pleasant flight.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.808
Oh, my.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.077
I'm already in chapter two.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.346
Great.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.982
I gave her this book earlier.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.753
She's a huge Dr. Phil fan.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.193
I saw that. Very nice of you.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.958
Well, that's me.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.726
People-please r, 24-7.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.465
- Well, you are popular.
- I'm sorry.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.938
- No, it's OK. No.
- It isn't usually like this.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.338
Go ahead.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.807
Hey. What's up?

19:26.099 --> 19:28.340
Yeah. No, it's OK.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.041
So it's definitely happening?

19:31.104 --> 19:33.414
5:30. OK, done deal.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.413
Work. For the last time.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.492
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Good flight.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.228
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.267
At this time we'd like
to ask that you discontinue

19:58.331 --> 20:01.778
the use of any electronic devices,
pagers, cell phones, laptops,

20:01.834 --> 20:04.838
anything with a switch
should now be in the off position.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.714
The use of cell phones is not
allowed during the flight.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.880
A list of devices suitable for use
can be found on the cover

20:10.944 --> 20:14.687
- of your Fresh Air magazine.
- Flight attendants, please be seated.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.571
From the deck, looks
like we're the red-eye to Miami.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.110
Welcome.
The weather conditions may cause

20:33.166 --> 20:36.409
a bumpy takeoff, but don't worry,
we'll soon climb above it.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.540
We'll see if we can't
make up lost time.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.484
We're number one for departure.
Flight attendants, secure the cabin.

20:43.977 --> 20:48.357
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been cleared
for takeoff. Please enjoy your flight.

21:06.165 --> 21:08.645
- We're not gonna make it.
- Shut up.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.044
We're not gonna make it.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.481
Shut up. I will punch
you in your face. Shut up.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.882
Just kidding. Come on.

21:37.196 --> 21:39.335
Are we there yet?

21:39.399 --> 21:44.041
So was Henrietta your
mom's mom or your dad's mom?

21:47.440 --> 21:49.511
My mom's. My dad's...

21:52.979 --> 21:55.687
My dad's died a long time ago.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.591
Are your folks still together?

21:58.951 --> 22:02.330
They divorced three years ago,
married for 32.

22:06.259 --> 22:07.966
That's a shame.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.462
So your mom...

22:09.529 --> 22:12.271
Mom moved back to Texas
and Dad stayed in Miami.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.539
I see. And does Dad still work?

22:14.600 --> 22:17.479
Yeah. No! He's recently retired.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.643
He's got a lot of time on his hands
so he makes phone calls.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.846
OK. He's filling
all his work time with...

22:22.909 --> 22:24.650
Worry time.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.419
Does he have reason
to worry about you?

22:29.349 --> 22:31.761
Well, even if he does, I mean,

22:31.818 --> 22:34.958
he's just gotta get used
to the fact that life changes

22:35.021 --> 22:37.865
and sometimes things happen.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.267
I know what you mean.

22:39.325 --> 22:42.568
Usually when things are going perfectly,
you're back on track,

22:42.628 --> 22:47.077
everything's going to plan,
and then one day, outta nowhere,

22:47.133 --> 22:49.704
somebody forgets to bolt
the engine to the wing.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.612
Yeah.

22:51.671 --> 22:55.551
This is your captain. We're through
the worst of it, so you can relax.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.884
Keep your seat belt
fastened while seated,

22:57.944 --> 23:00.788
as we may hit more turbulence.
Thank you.

23:00.847 --> 23:04.818
- Thanks for distracting me.
- Well, it's not really what I'm doing.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.693
What are you doing?

23:06.753 --> 23:09.324
Just keeping the focus
on you and your father.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.728
Why?

23:11.791 --> 23:13.293
Part of my job.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.035
Are you a shrink?

23:17.330 --> 23:19.310
No. Manager.

23:20.767 --> 23:23.043
- Better not say of a hotel.
- No.

23:23.102 --> 23:26.083
- That would...
- Cause you to buy a self-help book.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.183
So, what do you do?

23:31.244 --> 23:35.522
Government overthrows, flashy
high-profile assassinations. The usual.

23:38.518 --> 23:42.022
- You're a spy. I should've known.
- No, I'm not a spy.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.629
- A hit man.
- I'm a lousy shot.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.898
Right. You work for the CIA.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.201
Well, if I did,
I couldn't say, could I?

23:50.263 --> 23:52.402
- But, no.
- The Mafia?

23:52.465 --> 23:54.138
The money's shit.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.280
OK, well, that's kinda weird.

23:59.338 --> 24:01.784
- Why don't you tell me what you do?
- I did.

24:04.844 --> 24:08.189
OK. OK, I'm sorry, I...

24:08.247 --> 24:11.626
It's... Whatever you do,
that's your own business.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.823
Just as long as you're not...

24:13.886 --> 24:15.957
What?

24:16.022 --> 24:18.434
Hijacking the plane.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.767
No. No, I'm not suicidal.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.398
That's good.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.240
You're right.
Most days it is my own business.

24:26.299 --> 24:30.645
But right now, as fate would have it,
my business is all about you.

24:32.271 --> 24:35.013
- I'm sorry, about me?
- That's right.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.716
OK, I'm not sure
where you're going with this.

24:38.778 --> 24:42.316
Charles Keefe. One of your
regular VIPs. Ring a bell?

24:45.117 --> 24:47.119
- No, should it?
- Yes, it should.

24:47.186 --> 24:50.360
He's on his way to your hotel
and that's why you need to listen.

24:50.423 --> 24:52.130
No. No, I don't think...

24:52.191 --> 24:54.193
- I don't have to do that.
- Yes, you do,

24:54.260 --> 24:55.933
if you want your dad to live.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.243
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

25:04.504 --> 25:05.915
Yeah.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.483
Suit yourself. You might
wanna take a look at this.

25:12.545 --> 25:15.856
JR. Joe Reisert.
Your father? Yes?

25:16.616 --> 25:18.823
- Where did you get that?
- I didn't get it.

25:18.885 --> 25:21.456
My associate grabbed it
off your dad's desk.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.434
Apparently next to
your graduation picture.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.229
JR. Definitely Dad's wallet.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.966
His initials. But gee, mine too.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.907
Jack Rippner. Credit card, license.

25:31.964 --> 25:35.036
"For some reason,
Miss Stewardess, this unstable,

25:35.101 --> 25:37.741
inebriated girl,
whom I've never met before tonight,

25:37.803 --> 25:41.341
suddenly went crazy
when I took it out of my pocket."

25:42.141 --> 25:45.384
You tell the flight attendant
and your dad dies.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.723
Sit down.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.398
You might wanna buckle up.

26:12.538 --> 26:15.917
- Any luck?
- Our pensions go, then our coffeepots.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.922
'IS-G's flashing.
Do you want me to...?

26:18.978 --> 26:22.187
I'll take care of it. She
probably just wants another drink.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.319
Maybe I'll join her.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.862
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.099
- What can I do for ya?
- Leese,

26:36.162 --> 26:38.802
did you need another
pillow or anything?

26:40.166 --> 26:42.237
No, I don't need anything.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.972
She's just had a really rough day.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.380
A death in the family.

26:46.439 --> 26:50.148
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.985
- I'll get you water and some tissues.
- Thanks.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.047
- Be right back.
- Thank you.

26:56.716 --> 27:00.095
That was great, Leese.
Keep doing the right thing.

27:00.152 --> 27:03.463
Just bottle the emotions
a little more, OK?

27:05.491 --> 27:07.402
Have you done something to my father?

27:07.460 --> 27:11.602
No. And it'll stay that way
as long as you keep playing along.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.446
What do you want from me?

27:16.502 --> 27:18.948
Now, I wanna wait
for your Kleenex and water.

27:19.005 --> 27:22.350
And once we have our privacy,
we can get back to business.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.445
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

27:24.510 --> 27:27.491
- Sure. Feel better, hon.
- Thank you.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.706
I need you to call your hotel.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.641
It's very simple.
Just use your managerial pull

27:45.698 --> 27:49.976
to move Keefe
from 3825 to suite 4080.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.915
I'll leave the details to you.
You just sell it.

27:54.006 --> 27:57.783
You've got the wrong person.
I don't have the authority to do that.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.550
Well, I happen to know that you do.

27:59.612 --> 28:01.853
You're the only voice
that can get this done

28:01.914 --> 28:04.019
by the time I need it done.

28:06.919 --> 28:09.456
- You need me to write it down?
- No.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.927
Well, then what's the delay?

28:16.796 --> 28:20.369
So by changing Keefe's room,
does that make it easier?

28:23.369 --> 28:27.579
Lisa, whatever female-driven,
emotion-based dilemma

28:27.640 --> 28:31.247
you're dealing with right now,
you have my sympathy.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.654
But for the sake
of time and sanity,

28:33.713 --> 28:37.422
let's break this down into a little
male-driven, fact-based logic.

28:37.483 --> 28:41.192
One simple phone call
saves your dad's life.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.233
And it has to be made soon.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.728
You're gonna kill Keefe,
aren't you?

28:48.794 --> 28:52.264
You really need to start worrying
more about your dad, Leese.

28:52.331 --> 28:55.835
How am I supposed to know if he's OK?
How do I know you haven't hurt him?

28:55.901 --> 28:58.040
- He's fine.
- Why am I supposed to believe?

28:58.104 --> 29:01.950
The last call I got said he was sitting
in the TV room eating leftover lasagna

29:02.007 --> 29:04.180
and watching the comedy marathon.

29:04.243 --> 29:08.851
Relax, Leese. By now my guy is
probably back in his silver Beemer,

29:08.914 --> 29:12.726
parked outside
9321 Blossom Palms Lane.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.891
He's sitting in the dark,
listening to a little smooth jazz,

29:15.955 --> 29:19.232
while he sharpens
his 12-inch KA-BAR.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.264
That's a knife, Leese.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.108
- I wanna talk to my dad.
- Sure. After you make the call.

29:32.171 --> 29:35.846
No. I wanna know he's OK right now
or I don't call anybody.

29:40.746 --> 29:42.282
Your dime.

29:44.183 --> 29:45.992
Credit card?

29:48.554 --> 29:52.832
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has
turned off the fasten seat belt sign.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.803
You're free to move about the cabin.

30:22.121 --> 30:27.469
Stay tuned for more of the comedy
marathon following these messages.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.744
I'm comin', I'm comin'!

30:36.202 --> 30:37.613
God.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.914
- Hello?
- Dad?

30:41.574 --> 30:44.054
Leese? Are you already home?

30:45.311 --> 30:47.587
No, I'm on the air phone on the plane.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.353
We were late taking off and...

30:49.415 --> 30:53.329
Honey, I know you don't like it
when I ask, but are you all right?

30:53.385 --> 30:55.228
You sound upset.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.959
Leese?

31:00.025 --> 31:02.801
Leese? Are you still there?

31:06.098 --> 31:08.442
Did he sound healthy to you?

31:08.500 --> 31:11.413
I hope that's a yes,
because that's the best I can do.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.177
Now let's get this over with.

31:14.773 --> 31:18.311
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Can you help me again?

31:18.377 --> 31:21.153
Last time, I promise.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.658
Sure.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.599
Don't get cute.

31:43.869 --> 31:46.110
- You're so sweet.
- Hello, again.

31:46.171 --> 31:49.380
You know, I didn't think that
this book would be so much work.

31:49.441 --> 31:53.617
There's all these surveys about yourself
before you can go on to the rest...

31:53.679 --> 31:55.784
Could you wait one second?

31:56.282 --> 31:58.455
- Sure.
- My nails.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.259
Know what? Don't worry
about the surveys. I'll just...

32:01.320 --> 32:04.699
- I'll just highlight my favorite part.
- Wonderful.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.364
- Got it.
- Great.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.427
- You are a lifesaver.
- Yep.

32:08.494 --> 32:11.964
Would you gimme your address too?
I wanna return the favor.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.477
I'm always breaking
my nails on these things.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.241
I'm gonna need you
to help me put it back up.

32:17.303 --> 32:21.115
- Clear the aisle.
- We're on a collision course.

32:22.975 --> 32:25.478
- I'll come back for that later.
- No. Here you go.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.114
- Last time?
- Thank you.

32:27.179 --> 32:28.487
OK.

32:29.081 --> 32:32.961
- Sorry I'm... I'm blocking your seat.
- Not at all.

32:33.018 --> 32:34.895
- Excuse us, ma'am.
- I'm going.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.490
Thank you.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.936
They're much pushier these days.

32:47.533 --> 32:50.810
I didn't want this
to get complicated.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.809
I have to assume
she's gonna read that.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.113
Read what?

33:17.997 --> 33:21.035
- How's she doin'?
- Much better. Thank you.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.046
- Good.
- Thanks.

33:47.826 --> 33:48.896
Pillow?

33:49.395 --> 33:51.204
Would you like a blanket?

33:53.665 --> 33:57.010
Pillow? Pillow?

33:57.069 --> 34:00.448
Would you like a blanket?
Would you like a blanket?

34:26.031 --> 34:28.602
Please return to your seats. Thank you.

34:30.335 --> 34:33.282
"I want you to get
excited about your life.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.375
But you gotta get real.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.443
I'm challenging you, starting now,

34:37.509 --> 34:40.718
to stop dealing
in opinions and assumptions

34:40.779 --> 34:42.622
and start dealing in facts.

34:42.681 --> 34:46.185
Fact: Fearing to act is human.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.822
Failing to act
is just plain dumb.

34:48.887 --> 34:52.027
Fact: Thinking when
you should be acting

34:52.091 --> 34:54.298
will only make your head hurt."

34:54.359 --> 34:57.306
I'm not makin' this up, Leese.
It's right here.

34:57.362 --> 34:58.966
Fact:

34:59.031 --> 35:00.942
You've been out
for a half an hour

35:00.999 --> 35:03.605
and Keefe's room still
hasn't been changed.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.149
So I got you some aspirin.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.580
I need you coherent, Leese.

35:12.044 --> 35:14.422
Well, we were hoping
things would calm down,

35:14.480 --> 35:18.485
but that's not happening. So control's
just cleared us up to 35,000 feet.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.827
Let's see if we can't get above
this weather, smooth things out.

35:22.354 --> 35:25.028
Now, let's do this.

35:29.695 --> 35:32.938
If I do it, if I make that call,

35:32.998 --> 35:36.411
do you promise you'll tell who's
outside my dad's house to go away?

35:36.468 --> 35:39.381
You call, I call,
Dad wakes up, puts on coffee,

35:39.438 --> 35:42.885
never suspects a thing,
you go back to work, life goes on.

35:47.212 --> 35:50.352
I am now calling your hotel.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.293
I don't have to tell you
to sound convincing.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.333
- You've said enough.
- Good.

36:00.559 --> 36:03.563
Good morning,
Lux Atlantic Resort, this is Cynthia.

36:03.629 --> 36:06.371
Hello? Hello?

36:06.431 --> 36:08.172
Cynthia, it's Lisa.

36:08.233 --> 36:11.009
Lisa? You sound terrible.
Are you OK?

36:11.069 --> 36:14.846
There's just... There's
a lot of turbulence on the plane.

36:14.907 --> 36:16.818
- You're still on the plane?
- Yeah.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.821
I heard flights are delayed.

36:18.877 --> 36:21.448
You'd be so proud of me.
We're all set for Keefe.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.687
Cristal on ice, the cigars,
not easy to find this time of night.

36:24.750 --> 36:28.095
You know, about that. I'm gonna
need you to do me a favor, OK?

36:28.153 --> 36:29.689
You sure you're OK?

36:29.755 --> 36:32.201
Please do not
ask me again if I'm OK.

36:32.257 --> 36:33.463
I hope you're...

36:39.798 --> 36:43.075
Look, somethings come up.

36:43.135 --> 36:45.581
We gotta change Keefe's room.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.514
Can you pull up the file?

36:49.908 --> 36:53.549
We're gonna move him
to room 4080. Right.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.592
The PIN is 4882.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.658
- I'm gonna need you to take...
- Gimme that.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.856
Hello? Cynthia?

37:05.691 --> 37:08.262
Pretty clear thinking,
given the circumstances.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.864
Let me guess,
stress management courses?

37:10.929 --> 37:14.604
They're really paying off. We get
outta this, I may have to steal you.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.776
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?

37:16.835 --> 37:20.112
- Are the phones not working?
- They cut out during storms.

37:20.172 --> 37:22.277
They'll come back
when we find clear air.

37:22.341 --> 37:25.481
- Great. Thank you.
- You don't have a backup plan?

37:27.479 --> 37:30.619
- Why are you doing this here?
- Blame your grandmother.

37:30.682 --> 37:33.026
She keeled over,
you hopped on the next flight,

37:33.085 --> 37:36.692
- Keefe changed plans, here we are.
- Excuse me. Peanuts or pretzels?

37:36.755 --> 37:38.393
- Peanuts, thank you.
- Ma'am?

37:38.457 --> 37:40.130
No.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.170
So, what happens
if they don't start working?

37:44.529 --> 37:47.237
You bury your dad
in a closed casket.

38:01.179 --> 38:06.060
Well, gang, brace yourselves,
'cause I have news. I'm engaged!

39:03.575 --> 39:04.883
I know him.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.890
- Know who?
- Keefe.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.517
He's a really decent man.

39:10.582 --> 39:13.586
Well, sometimes bad things
happen to good people.

39:14.086 --> 39:15.429
Like you.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.967
You know, I've known you
for a while now, Lisa.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.698
Before tonight, I mean.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.673
And far as I can tell,
your life revolves around your job.

39:24.730 --> 39:28.143
The occasional cocktail
at the corner cafe,

39:28.200 --> 39:32.580
the classic late-night movies.
And scrambled eggs at 3am.

39:32.637 --> 39:34.583
What turned you into such a loner?

39:34.639 --> 39:36.846
Was it your parents' divorce?

39:38.610 --> 39:41.216
Wait, did someone break your heart?

39:47.486 --> 39:50.296
The captain has turned off
the fasten seat belt sign.

39:50.355 --> 39:53.700
- I have to go to the restroom.
- You're free to move about the cabin.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.535
Best I can do.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.600
OK, you know what? You got me.

40:00.665 --> 40:04.169
I'm gonna make that call
when I can make the call.

40:04.236 --> 40:06.546
But right now you gotta let me go.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.053
I need to go.

40:10.108 --> 40:13.317
OK. I trust you.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.657
And I need my purse.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.717
But not that much.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.570
I was really nervous
there for a minute.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.436
We just kept goin' in and out.

40:49.514 --> 40:50.959
Excuse me.

40:58.356 --> 40:59.494
You in line?

41:01.526 --> 41:03.767
Yeah. Do you wanna...?

41:03.829 --> 41:05.137
You were here first.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.437
Excuse me.

41:44.569 --> 41:46.776
Oh, God.

41:54.746 --> 41:57.454
OK. Get up.

42:37.489 --> 42:38.524
I was wondering...

42:47.232 --> 42:48.267
Don't fight me.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.572
You're all worked up
from being so creative. Breathe.

42:51.636 --> 42:52.637
Hey, Rebecca.

42:53.972 --> 42:56.145
You can't just run off like that.

42:56.207 --> 42:57.845
A man went in there.

42:57.909 --> 43:01.152
Everyone shares. I'll take you
to the one close to your seat.

43:01.212 --> 43:04.125
But a lady's in there too.

43:04.182 --> 43:07.095
OK, one of those flights.
Here, come on.

43:08.553 --> 43:10.931
Please, just stop whoever's
at my dad's house.

43:10.989 --> 43:15.563
I already have, by twice
intercepting these little communiqués.

43:15.627 --> 43:18.574
If they'd have fallen into
the hands of a stewardess,

43:18.630 --> 43:21.873
she'd have gone to the cockpit
and we'd land somewhere else.

43:21.933 --> 43:24.470
If that happens, Leese,
our guy in the BMW's

43:24.536 --> 43:28.746
gonna know about it.
So do Dad a favor

43:28.807 --> 43:32.050
and stop gambling with his life.

43:38.783 --> 43:42.697
You don't have to do this.
Any of this.

43:52.864 --> 43:54.639
Someone do that to you?

43:55.934 --> 43:57.470
No.

43:58.837 --> 44:00.748
Is that what it is?

44:02.874 --> 44:04.410
No.

44:05.310 --> 44:06.550
You know what I think?

44:08.246 --> 44:09.418
You know what I think?

44:09.481 --> 44:12.690
I think you're not
such an honest person.

44:12.751 --> 44:15.129
Because I've followed you
for eight weeks now

44:15.186 --> 44:17.826
and I never once
saw you order anything

44:17.889 --> 44:20.165
but a fucking sea breeze.

44:20.225 --> 44:23.035
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

44:28.233 --> 44:30.372
I never lied to you, Leese.

44:30.435 --> 44:33.507
Know why?
'Cause it doesn't serve me.

44:33.571 --> 44:36.381
We're both professional.
We have the will and the means

44:36.441 --> 44:38.648
to follow through.
'Cause when we don't,

44:38.710 --> 44:41.281
our customers aren't happy.
And when they're not,

44:41.346 --> 44:43.826
we suffer and our lives go to shit.

44:45.050 --> 44:47.656
And that's not going to happen.

44:47.719 --> 44:49.323
Is it'?

44:51.089 --> 44:54.195
- No.
- Good.

44:54.259 --> 44:57.570
Because I'm gonna tell you
the phones are working again.

44:57.629 --> 45:00.337
Are you sure we
got a deal this time?

45:02.300 --> 45:04.109
Yes.

45:04.969 --> 45:06.971
Peachy.

45:09.741 --> 45:12.221
Well, thanks for the quickie.

45:13.545 --> 45:15.047
Good.

45:16.881 --> 45:18.360
Come on.

45:21.486 --> 45:22.794
Excuse me.

45:26.424 --> 45:28.461
This isn't a motel.

45:29.027 --> 45:30.529
Sure.

45:33.795 --> 45:37.004
- Lose something?
- Yes, my book.

45:37.065 --> 45:41.844
It was here. Maybe it
slipped down behind your...

45:42.704 --> 45:45.207
I need you to pull
yourself together, Lisa.

45:45.273 --> 45:48.117
We seem to have
attracted a little attention.

45:48.176 --> 45:51.521
Once they've made their rounds,
we'll make the call.

45:52.547 --> 45:55.187
The captain has turned
on the fasten seat belt sign.

45:55.249 --> 45:58.890
Please return to your seats
as soon as possible. Thank you.

46:13.067 --> 46:16.207
Yo. You steal my pen, jackass?

46:16.270 --> 46:18.876
No, man, cut it out. I'm sleepin'.

46:24.112 --> 46:27.423
Mr. Keefe has a 7am breakfast
and the meetings at 8am sharp.

46:27.482 --> 46:30.122
We're out by 9:15. How we doin'?

46:30.184 --> 46:31.993
Cars are en route and on time.

46:32.053 --> 46:34.727
Armored Escalades,
full communication package.

46:34.789 --> 46:37.963
- Thanks. We're all set.
- Good. Get these outwith changes.

46:38.026 --> 46:39.437
- You got it.
- Think fast!

46:39.494 --> 46:41.667
- Danny. Daddy's working.
- Thattaboy.

46:41.729 --> 46:42.969
Come here, you.

46:43.965 --> 46:46.104
You should be sleeping.

46:46.801 --> 46:48.940
Ten minutes till wheels down.

47:10.024 --> 47:11.731
Trash?

47:20.935 --> 47:22.505
I'll get that.

47:32.747 --> 47:34.192
It's time.

47:41.656 --> 47:43.567
Thank you.

47:56.237 --> 47:58.410
Lux Atlantic Resort, this is Cynthia.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.951
Hello?

48:01.008 --> 48:03.579
- Cynthia, it's Lisa.
- Hey, you.

48:03.644 --> 48:05.817
So I guess you
still need that favor.

48:05.880 --> 48:10.260
Yeah. I was checking
with Dan Young from Maintenance.

48:10.318 --> 48:13.527
- We can't put Keefe in that room.
- But he always stays there.

48:13.588 --> 48:18.367
I know. But they were fixing
a water valve in the master bath

48:18.426 --> 48:22.340
and they didn't fix the right one
so if anyone uses the plumbing...

48:22.396 --> 48:24.342
- The shit'll hit the fan.
- Exactly.

48:24.398 --> 48:27.311
So where do we move him to?

48:29.670 --> 48:32.446
Lisa? You still there?

48:32.507 --> 48:34.248
4080.

48:35.610 --> 48:38.557
4080. OK.

48:38.613 --> 48:41.219
- His security people will be...?
- You're right.

48:41.282 --> 48:44.229
They're not gonna be happy,
so just...

48:44.285 --> 48:47.755
- Just tell them I authorized it.
- OK. Oh, my God.

48:47.822 --> 48:51.861
The cigars, the Cristal.
There's hardly time, Leese. I better go.

49:01.969 --> 49:03.642
Outstanding.

49:05.640 --> 49:07.313
We're close.

49:16.751 --> 49:17.752
What?

49:17.819 --> 49:21.699
You know what. My dad.

49:21.756 --> 49:24.498
Make the call.
Your part of the deal.

49:29.730 --> 49:32.438
- I still need you.
- You promised.

49:32.500 --> 49:34.844
I'll keep that.
As soon as we're on the ground,

49:34.902 --> 49:37.246
I'll get confirmation
Keefe has been handled.

49:37.305 --> 49:40.843
While you wait,
what if your guy decides to kill my dad

49:40.908 --> 49:43.684
- because you didn't make the call?
- He doesn't move

49:43.744 --> 49:47.988
unless I say so. He's a good dog.
He responds only to his master's voice.

49:49.851 --> 49:53.094
It'll all be over soon.
The Keefes will be history,

49:53.154 --> 49:55.532
your dad will be safe,
we'll both go back...

49:55.590 --> 49:58.867
- What did you say?
- What?

49:58.926 --> 50:00.303
His family's with him?

50:01.529 --> 50:03.509
You're gonna kill his family too?

50:05.066 --> 50:09.845
Somebody wants to send a big brash
message, that's their business.

50:09.904 --> 50:11.941
I do my part, move on.

50:19.213 --> 50:20.692
Oh, my God.

50:21.849 --> 50:23.624
Lisa...

50:42.203 --> 50:45.616
Hi, welcome to the Lux Atlantic.
Welcome to the Lux Atlantic.

50:45.673 --> 50:47.311
Hi. Here are all your keys.

50:47.375 --> 50:50.549
We're putting you in suite 4080.
Manager got that approved.

50:50.611 --> 50:52.784
4080'? We're in 3825.

50:52.847 --> 50:56.124
- 4080. Beautiful suite.
- We're always in 3825.

50:56.183 --> 50:58.720
Except, we've got a bad
plumbing problem in 3825.

50:59.820 --> 51:01.857
4080, toilets are good.

51:01.923 --> 51:03.664
They want us to switch rooms.

51:03.724 --> 51:06.796
We made redundant reservations.
We can go to the Hilton.

51:06.861 --> 51:09.899
Charles. The kids are exhausted.

51:09.964 --> 51:12.570
- Who made the approval?
- Lisa Reisert.

51:12.633 --> 51:14.579
It's OK, I know her.

51:14.635 --> 51:17.047
- We need to sweep the room.
- Well, get on it.

51:17.104 --> 51:18.549
Yes, sir.

51:31.452 --> 51:34.160
Well, we've begun
our initial descent into Miami.

51:34.221 --> 51:38.169
We'll have you on the ground soon. We
know you have many choices when you fly.

51:38.225 --> 51:41.069
On behalf of the crew,
thank you for choosing Fresh Air.

51:41.128 --> 51:43.870
- Seat in the upright position.
- How long till we land?

51:43.931 --> 51:46.377
We should be touching down
in just a few minutes.

51:47.802 --> 51:51.682
Ma'am. Please put
your seat up. Thank you.

51:51.739 --> 51:55.152
In preparation for landing,
make sure your seat belts are fastened

51:55.209 --> 51:58.520
and your seats in the upright
positions with tray tables stowed.

51:58.579 --> 51:59.956
Thank you.

52:03.351 --> 52:04.625
What's wrong now?

52:04.685 --> 52:08.360
You hit me on the head and slammed
me against the wall, remember?

52:09.056 --> 52:10.330
Well, suck it up.

52:10.391 --> 52:13.565
We've come too far.
Don't blow it now.

52:14.195 --> 52:17.267
Come on, sit up. Sit up, Leese.

52:18.332 --> 52:20.278
We're almost there.

52:43.691 --> 52:45.864
- Anything?
- Not much. A yacht.

52:45.926 --> 52:48.270
Way out there. Fishing, I think.

52:48.329 --> 52:50.775
- Call it in.
- Right away.

53:00.574 --> 53:03.714
Flight attendants,
secure the cabin for arrival in Miami.

53:06.080 --> 53:09.493
We have gate information for those
of you continuing your travel.

53:09.550 --> 53:13.191
A gate attendant will help you.
Thank you for your patience

53:13.254 --> 53:16.394
throughout this flight.
Have a pleasant day.

53:16.457 --> 53:19.165
At the gate,
I'll follow you into the terminal,

53:19.226 --> 53:21.729
we'll hit Starbucks,
grab a couple of lattes,

53:21.796 --> 53:25.073
kill ten, 15 minutes till I get the call
that Keefe's been taken out.

53:25.132 --> 53:27.510
And then I walk outta your life.

53:29.070 --> 53:32.984
Once I'm outta your line of sight, I'll
call off Mr. Killer from outside Dad's

53:33.040 --> 53:36.817
and then you're free.
Free to yell and scream,

53:36.877 --> 53:42.020
call your dad, tell him to run
to the neighbor's. Sound good?

53:42.083 --> 53:43.721
Whatever you say.

53:44.218 --> 53:45.925
What, no questions?

53:47.955 --> 53:50.697
What good have they done me so far?

53:52.827 --> 53:54.864
Best question you've asked all night.

53:55.963 --> 53:57.909
Flight attendants, please be seated.

54:22.923 --> 54:25.995
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of your Fresh Air crew,

54:26.060 --> 54:28.199
we'd like to welcome you to Miami.

54:28.262 --> 54:30.833
The weather is 79 and sunny.

54:36.904 --> 54:39.680
- It's all clear down below.
- Catch much today?

54:39.740 --> 54:41.686
Not yet, sir.

54:41.742 --> 54:44.382
- Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
- Hey, no problem.

54:47.047 --> 54:48.924
- You guys have a good one.
- Thanks.

54:48.983 --> 54:50.860
- Good luck, fellas.
- Thanks.

54:52.052 --> 54:53.963
Thirteen, sergeant one on central.

54:57.291 --> 54:59.931
- All right, we're clear.
- OK, let's go.

55:12.139 --> 55:14.813
Coast Guard says it's all clear.

55:14.875 --> 55:16.218
Bring 'em up.

55:29.623 --> 55:31.398
It happened in a parking lot.

55:32.760 --> 55:34.467
The scar.

55:35.396 --> 55:37.307
Two years ago.

55:38.966 --> 55:40.673
In the middle of the day.

55:45.039 --> 55:47.918
He held a knife to my throat...

55:47.975 --> 55:49.977
...the whole time.

55:52.079 --> 55:54.616
Ever since, I've been
trying to convince myself

55:54.682 --> 55:57.595
of one thing, over and over.

56:03.224 --> 56:06.000
That it was beyond your control.

56:07.194 --> 56:09.037
No.

56:12.333 --> 56:14.404
That it would never happen again.

56:33.754 --> 56:35.427
Excuse me.

56:36.824 --> 56:38.428
Lady!

56:40.828 --> 56:42.705
I have a flight to catch. Sorry.

56:43.831 --> 56:45.139
You all right?

56:46.000 --> 56:49.004
Oh, God! We need help back here!

56:49.069 --> 56:50.514
Oh, my God.

56:51.071 --> 56:53.677
- Is anyone a doctor?!
- Excuse me. Sorry.

56:53.741 --> 56:56.187
- A man needs help.
- Stay right there.

56:56.243 --> 56:58.245
Help! Help!

56:58.879 --> 57:02.452
- One minute, miss, please.
- We need a doctor!

57:02.516 --> 57:06.794
Stay... OK, everyone, please
remain calm and return to your seats.

57:08.088 --> 57:10.796
- There goes your pen, dude.
- We need an ambulance.

57:11.925 --> 57:14.496
Hey, stop that woman.
She stabbed the guy!

57:20.634 --> 57:23.478
We have an emergency.
Security to the M-2 gate.

57:25.439 --> 57:26.713
Attention, Security.

57:26.774 --> 57:31.189
Request for assistance, code three,
gate M-2. Security, code three.

57:37.151 --> 57:40.257
- Did you see where she went?
- Right around the corner.

57:42.056 --> 57:43.763
I'm really thirsty.

57:43.824 --> 57:47.169
Hi. I'm Wendy
from airport food services.

57:47.227 --> 57:50.606
- Have you dined at our terminal before?
- Yeah.

57:52.733 --> 57:53.871
I used to...

57:55.402 --> 57:56.881
Where did she go?

57:57.938 --> 57:58.939
Sir!

57:59.139 --> 58:01.278
OK, we have a doctor for you.

58:03.077 --> 58:05.785
Don't speak. You don't wanna
damage your vocal cords.

58:05.846 --> 58:08.122
It doesn't look bad.
It's your windpipe.

58:08.182 --> 58:10.389
It's not dangerous really. No, don't!

58:11.118 --> 58:13.598
Sir. Sir!

58:13.987 --> 58:16.729
- Hey, you need a hospital!
- Sir!

58:20.227 --> 58:23.299
You're gonna have to fill out
a report to the police!

58:25.933 --> 58:27.879
- That's my scarf!
- Whoa.

58:29.903 --> 58:33.350
- Passengers for flight 1221, 1221,
- Come on.

58:33.407 --> 58:35.284
- We're boarding rows...
- Come on.

58:36.410 --> 58:39.050
No! Shit!

58:42.816 --> 58:44.659
Gate M-2!

58:46.320 --> 58:49.164
M-2. M-2, all the way up!

58:58.632 --> 59:01.511
- Yeah, we're up there right now.
- M-2!

59:05.672 --> 59:09.176
Your attention. Arriving passengers
from Fresh Air flight 217,

59:09.243 --> 59:13.055
please retrieve your baggage
at carousel number three.

59:23.957 --> 59:24.958
Careful.

59:37.438 --> 59:39.179
Heads up!

1:00:00.093 --> 1:00:01.766
Come on. Come on, close.

1:00:31.558 --> 1:00:34.471
- Come on!
- Danny! Slow down, honey.

1:00:34.528 --> 1:00:37.771
- Kids, be careful.
- Keep two on the roof, two downstairs.

1:00:37.831 --> 1:00:39.538
- Fantastic.
- Nice.

1:00:41.735 --> 1:00:42.975
Isn't this nice?

1:00:58.018 --> 1:01:00.760
Welcome to Miami International Airport.

1:01:00.821 --> 1:01:03.768
- Smoking is not allowed.
- As soon as I get in.

1:01:03.824 --> 1:01:07.135
Keep your baggage with you
and report unattended baggage

1:01:07.194 --> 1:01:09.572
to airport security. Thank you.

1:01:12.232 --> 1:01:13.734
My Car!

1:01:18.605 --> 1:01:20.380
OK. Come on.

1:01:25.913 --> 1:01:27.551
Shit!

1:01:31.251 --> 1:01:33.060
Shit! Jeez!

1:01:36.523 --> 1:01:39.003
OK. OK, one more.

1:01:41.962 --> 1:01:43.600
Got it.

1:01:44.731 --> 1:01:47.075
Lux Atlantic Resort,
this is Cynthia...

1:01:47.134 --> 1:01:50.240
- Put me through to Keefe's room!
- Lisa? What's going on?

1:01:50.304 --> 1:01:52.750
You have got
to get Keefe out of that room.

1:01:52.806 --> 1:01:55.719
- You already changed him.
- No, it's got nothing to...

1:01:55.776 --> 1:01:58.484
Look, I think somethings
gonna happen. You...

1:01:58.545 --> 1:02:00.388
Listen, pull the fire alarm.

1:02:00.447 --> 1:02:03.724
- What the hell are...?
- Evacuate the hotel! Get everyone out!

1:02:03.784 --> 1:02:06.890
You've got to go up there now
and physically tell them!

1:02:06.954 --> 1:02:08.831
Tell them that Keefe is a target!

1:02:08.889 --> 1:02:11.335
Cynthia, Keefe is a target!

1:02:11.391 --> 1:02:14.338
- Somebody's going to kill him!
- Oh, shit.

1:02:15.862 --> 1:02:17.842
Shit, shit.

1:02:22.369 --> 1:02:24.246
Get people out!

1:02:24.304 --> 1:02:26.978
Everybody, please make
your way toward the exit.

1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:30.487
Everybody stay calm.
We need to evacuate the lobby.

1:02:34.648 --> 1:02:37.060
OK, one more.
Come on, one more.

1:02:44.858 --> 1:02:46.394
Damn it!

1:02:47.961 --> 1:02:49.531
Hello?

1:03:05.278 --> 1:03:08.589
Mr. Keefe! Mr. Keefe!

1:03:11.184 --> 1:03:12.629
- Hello!
- What's goin' on?

1:03:12.686 --> 1:03:16.327
Somethings happening. Lisa called.
Get Keefe outta here.

1:03:16.390 --> 1:03:19.394
Code red! Get him outta here!
Come on! Move it!

1:03:25.465 --> 1:03:27.411
- Sarah, we gotta hurry.
- Danny.

1:03:27.467 --> 1:03:28.810
- Charles!
- Lydia!

1:03:28.869 --> 1:03:30.314
- We gotta go.
- You got him?

1:03:30.370 --> 1:03:32.816
- I got him!
- Everybody move! Rooftop! Go!

1:03:32.873 --> 1:03:34.375
Everybody, right now!

1:03:44.384 --> 1:03:47.558
- Get in the elevator!
- Let's go! Come on! Come on!

1:03:49.189 --> 1:03:51.567
- I want everybody outta there!
- Move!

1:03:52.325 --> 1:03:53.827
- Get in! Get in!
- Incoming!

1:03:53.894 --> 1:03:55.032
Move, people, move!

1:03:55.095 --> 1:03:56.233
Get down!

1:04:43.877 --> 1:04:44.878
Oh, my God.

1:05:02.295 --> 1:05:04.275
All right. Get him outta here.

1:05:04.331 --> 1:05:06.743
- Come on, let's go!
- Get out! Come on.

1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:09.280
- You OK?
- Yeah, we're OK.

1:05:09.336 --> 1:05:11.748
Let's go, come on, come on!

1:05:40.734 --> 1:05:42.873
Lisa?

1:05:43.336 --> 1:05:45.509
- Dad.
- Lisa, what the hell?

1:05:45.572 --> 1:05:48.212
- Did you call 911?
- I already did. Who is this?

1:05:48.275 --> 1:05:51.279
- I can explain that. Are you OK?
- Am I OK? Come on.

1:05:51.344 --> 1:05:54.188
- I have to call the hotel.
- Come on. Come on. Sit. Sit.

1:05:54.247 --> 1:05:57.694
- OK. OK. You're OK.
- Yeah.

1:05:57.751 --> 1:06:00.061
- OK.
- I'll get the first aid kit.

1:06:01.888 --> 1:06:03.765
The cops are on the way.

1:06:07.694 --> 1:06:10.732
- Lux Atlantic Resort.
- Cynthia, are you OK?

1:06:10.797 --> 1:06:12.777
- Yeah.
- Is everyone else OK?

1:06:12.833 --> 1:06:15.109
Yeah, yeah, sure,
we're all OK, I think.

1:06:15.168 --> 1:06:18.877
You better get over here. I have
no idea how I'm gonna explain this.

1:06:18.939 --> 1:06:22.250
OK. OK. I'm on my way.

1:06:23.743 --> 1:06:26.246
Dad, I need your keys.
We have to get...

1:06:28.348 --> 1:06:29.691
Hi.

1:06:35.155 --> 1:06:36.862
Dad!

1:06:36.923 --> 1:06:38.800
Oh, he's not dead.

1:06:38.859 --> 1:06:42.898
I wanted him to see
what I'm gonna do to you first.

1:06:48.702 --> 1:06:50.340
Dad.

1:06:51.771 --> 1:06:52.909
Come on.

1:06:53.206 --> 1:06:54.480
You have to get up.

1:06:58.144 --> 1:07:01.489
You see, Lisa, I never lie.

1:07:02.382 --> 1:07:04.362
OK, so is this personal now?

1:07:04.417 --> 1:07:06.829
Just finishin' the job.

1:07:06.887 --> 1:07:10.164
Well, you're too late.
Everyone's alive.

1:07:10.223 --> 1:07:13.830
In that hotel,
every single person is alive.

1:07:14.227 --> 1:07:18.107
What, you didn't know?
You failed, Jack.

1:07:19.566 --> 1:07:22.342
- I'll finish the job.
- Not in my house.

1:09:24.157 --> 1:09:28.333
Where's your male-driven,
fact-based logic now, Jack?

1:09:28.395 --> 1:09:31.399
I don't think that's what got you here.

1:09:31.464 --> 1:09:32.772
Did you hear me?

1:12:36.816 --> 1:12:39.160
This is 911 dispatch.
Is anyone there?

1:12:39.219 --> 1:12:40.323
Yes. Hello.

1:12:40.386 --> 1:12:43.595
I'm sorry it took so long.
We had an emergency downtown.

1:12:43.656 --> 1:12:46.660
It says you had someone hit
in front of your house.

1:12:46.726 --> 1:12:49.536
There is a man in my house
who's trying to kill me.

1:12:49.596 --> 1:12:52.338
OK, if you can,
lock yourself in a room immediately.

1:12:52.398 --> 1:12:53.638
Units are on the way.

1:12:53.700 --> 1:12:55.304
Just hurry.

1:13:25.298 --> 1:13:26.902
No!

1:13:31.337 --> 1:13:32.645
You're pathetic.

1:14:07.940 --> 1:14:10.420
- We'll talk again.
- Don't move.

1:14:37.904 --> 1:14:41.249
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.

1:15:08.334 --> 1:15:10.746
- Right over there. Right there.
- Excuse me.

1:15:10.803 --> 1:15:13.181
- Jerry, what's your 20?
- Stand by.

1:15:14.140 --> 1:15:16.677
- We got it covered.
- Are you OK?

1:15:16.743 --> 1:15:18.086
- Yeah, I'm...
- Yeah?

1:15:18.144 --> 1:15:19.214
Yeah, I mean...

1:15:19.278 --> 1:15:22.555
...I think we had a really good night,
all things considered.

1:15:22.615 --> 1:15:24.424
Just that one incident, really.

1:15:25.017 --> 1:15:27.122
Cynthia, you did so good.

1:15:27.186 --> 1:15:29.291
- Thank you.
- OK.

1:15:30.857 --> 1:15:32.996
Excuse me. Ladies.

1:15:33.326 --> 1:15:34.327
Mr. Keefe.

1:15:34.394 --> 1:15:36.738
I'd like to thank you both.

1:15:36.796 --> 1:15:39.902
- For my family, I thank you.
- Sir. We have to go.

1:15:39.966 --> 1:15:41.946
Let's talk soon, yes?

1:15:43.035 --> 1:15:45.572
- Roger that.
- Lisa!

1:15:45.638 --> 1:15:48.118
This is the worst
experience we have ever had.

1:15:48.174 --> 1:15:50.654
Do you have any idea
what we have been through?

1:15:50.710 --> 1:15:53.384
- Well...
- First there was no reservation.

1:15:53.446 --> 1:15:57.656
Then, our ceiling exploded.
I got chunks of plaster all over me.

1:15:57.717 --> 1:15:59.993
I could get asthma.

1:16:00.052 --> 1:16:03.363
I'm so sorry. ls there anything
we can do to make it up to you?

1:16:03.423 --> 1:16:05.699
Yes. Start by cleaning house.

1:16:05.758 --> 1:16:09.638
Get rid of her.
She is completely incompetent.

1:16:09.695 --> 1:16:12.835
Absolutely. And cheeky too.

1:16:12.899 --> 1:16:15.641
I see. Well...

1:16:18.070 --> 1:16:21.449
Here's what you can do. Fill out
a comment card at our front desk.

1:16:21.507 --> 1:16:25.319
A comment card? She asked us
to fill out a comment card.

1:16:25.378 --> 1:16:27.380
You want us to fill
out a comment card?

1:16:27.447 --> 1:16:30.018
Yes, I do. And after you finish,
you can go ahead

1:16:30.082 --> 1:16:31.993
and just shove it up your ass.

1:16:34.787 --> 1:16:36.858
Yeah.

1:16:38.157 --> 1:16:40.501
- You are so my hero.
- Let's get outta here.

1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:42.540
- Let's open the bar.
- Champagne?

1:16:42.595 --> 1:16:45.439
- Oh, anything but a bay breeze.
- OK.
