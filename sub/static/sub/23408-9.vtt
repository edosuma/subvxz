00:06.040 --> 00:06.840
[Sawyer] You've a very
important journey

00:06.880 --> 00:08.119
to go on, lass.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.080
I'm not ready.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.880
They're calling for you, Cait.

00:10.920 --> 00:11.840
You know what you have to do.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.440
For me.
For Islene,

00:13.480 --> 00:14.680
for us all.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.440
Now, listen to me.

00:17.480 --> 00:18.480
You are the one.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.440
It's you. Now, go.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.120
You have made
a big mistake here today.

00:24.640 --> 00:25.720
Send word to the Regni,

00:25.760 --> 00:28.040
they can start their siege.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.080
[Gildas]
It's been four moons.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.440
Perhaps we should parley.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.880
Parley my balls.

00:31.920 --> 00:32.880
[Aulus] From now on,

00:32.920 --> 00:35.240
let's say
we strike another deal.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.080
You keep away from me,
and I'll keep away from you.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.240
The gods
don't deal, Rome.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.600
The gods don't deal.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.840
Let me tell you something else
the prophecy says.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.040
You want to know
what happens next?

00:44.080 --> 00:45.240
I'll tell you.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.880
Lokka, in his rage,
releases three hellhounds

00:48.920 --> 00:50.760
to track down the Chosen One.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.520
Start trying a little harder,

00:53.560 --> 00:55.640
because this is no game.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.800
I'm not strong enough.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.440
Whatever was supposed to happen,

00:58.480 --> 01:01.360
it's not going to happen
because of me.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.680
Take me to the Underworld.

01:04.720 --> 01:05.760
Fuck...

01:05.800 --> 01:06.760
I was wrong.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.120

01:30.360 --> 01:33.600
The Samhain moon
was loud last night.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.600
The higher I flew,
the louder it spoke.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.640
What did the moon say?

01:38.680 --> 01:40.520
The invader must have
his victories.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.960
They will make him
drunk with glory.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.640
What's that?

01:45.680 --> 01:46.640
This...

01:47.840 --> 01:51.320
This is our only hope.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.360
[coughing]

02:20.440 --> 02:22.800
Who are you?

02:23.720 --> 02:25.040
I'm Death.

Since we've landed,
you've shown courage,

04:28.120 --> 04:29.760
wisdom, alacrity...

04:29.800 --> 04:31.120
and because of the
unfortunate disappearance

04:31.160 --> 04:33.400
of our erstwhile Praefectus,

04:33.440 --> 04:34.640
I am promoting you
to that rank.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.240
Congratulations.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.480
Follow me.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.440
Thank you... General.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.080
General Aulus, welcome.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.920
Ah, you seem happy today.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.440
I hear the Cantii are
eating straw and rat shit.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.480
Cheers a girl up no end.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.480
Yeah, the smell of victory,
we like that feeling.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.640
Our victory.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.840
I never forget when
an ally comes good.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.360
Where's my pretty boy?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.920
[Aulus] Praefectus
Lucius Validus

05:14.960 --> 05:16.680
is no longer with us.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.560
May I introduce
our new Praefectus,

05:18.600 --> 05:20.320
Vitus.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.680
Shame.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.840
I was rather lining him up
to seal the alliance.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.080
What happened?

05:25.120 --> 05:27.000
[Aulus] He'd not
been himself for some time.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.720
Likely a dose
of Cairo clap did for him.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.520
Oh, near miss
for me, then.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.160
Yeah, don't make Vitus
kiss your feet.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.560
It's his first day.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.080
Don't worry.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.640
I'll break him in gently.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.000
[Aulus chuckles]

05:41.040 --> 05:42.120
When the siege breaks,

05:42.160 --> 05:44.360
it will be a new world
for the Regni.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.840
Which is why I requested
your charming company today.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.120
I, uh, needed to clarify
terms of surrender.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.640
The terms are simple.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.280
I get the fortress,
you get the lands.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.040
And the Cantii
themselves?

05:56.080 --> 05:57.560
Your subjects.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.800
Under the ultimate protection
of the Emperor, of course.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.040
Now, you see,
that's the tricky part.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.160
Our people have ways
of doing this.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.320
Sacred ways.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.960
I haven't won this war

06:08.000 --> 06:10.560
until I have
blood sacrifice.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.400
Go on.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.600
500 Cantii heads.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.760
Warriors.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.080
To please our gods.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.160
I thought it was Kerra's head
you were after.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.080
I am.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.760
The gods have their own demands.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.040
If the Cantii know this,
why would they surrender?

06:27.080 --> 06:29.120
If they don't surrender,
we behead them all.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.440
They'd do the same to us.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.680
[laughs]

06:31.720 --> 06:33.200
You and your
angry gods...

06:40.200 --> 06:42.880
[distant beat
of troops marching]

06:42.920 --> 06:44.000
What do you think?

06:47.760 --> 06:49.600
It'll do.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.040
[marching feet thundering
to heavy drumbeats]

06:58.720 --> 07:01.120
I'd love to see
Copperknob's face now.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.720
[chuckling]

07:15.320 --> 07:16.560
Seems the end is near.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.920
Such a short reign.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.680
All those fights
with your father,

07:20.720 --> 07:21.960
and in the end,
what changed?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.760
You had the chance
to talk to the Romans,

07:23.800 --> 07:25.040
forge the future,

07:25.080 --> 07:27.760
and instead
you closed the door,

07:27.800 --> 07:28.840
watched your people starve.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.280
He would have been so proud--

07:30.320 --> 07:32.240
If you've come to torture me,
you're wasting your time.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.520
I came to warn you.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.640
It was Lindon who burned down
the grain store.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.600
I watched him do it.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.680
You're lying.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.520
He's a spy for Queen Antedia.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.480
Pure poison.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.560
[scoffs]

07:40.600 --> 07:42.640
So like daddy.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.000

08:53.360 --> 08:57.440
[voice struggling
as he intones]

09:01.680 --> 09:04.440
And now...

09:05.720 --> 09:09.200
[finishing prayer]

09:12.880 --> 09:16.560
[bear roars, crows shrieking]

09:37.200 --> 09:38.120
Hungry?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.200
Fuck off.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.680
I'm not scared
of you, Hellhound.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.920
That's what you are,
isn't it?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.880
Don't you want
to know how I know?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.240
I'm the small daughter.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.400
Me and the horse
was hoping for smaller.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.400
So you know the prophecy.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.280
You're taking me to him,
aren't you?

09:55.320 --> 09:57.440
That's the truth,
isn't it?

09:57.480 --> 09:58.960
That's who's paying you.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.120
Three things.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.560
One, you ever cheek me
like that again,

10:01.600 --> 10:03.320
I'm going to cut off
all this bottom stuff,

10:03.360 --> 10:05.640
and just take in this top bit.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.760
Two,

10:07.800 --> 10:09.480
don't take this
the wrong way,

10:09.520 --> 10:12.240
I genuinely couldn't give a fuck
who you are.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.840
No more than
the last hundred heads,

10:13.880 --> 10:16.560
so spare me how small
and how important you are.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.280
And three,

10:19.320 --> 10:22.800
who says I'm taking you
to the Romans?

10:29.320 --> 10:30.920
We must make room
for everyone inside.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.280
Of course,
but without food--

10:32.320 --> 10:33.560
We'll send out
raiding parties.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.840
We are surrounded.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.320
We have no choice.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.040
They're waiting for us
to do exactly that.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.040
Anyone goes out there,
they'll pick us off...

10:42.840 --> 10:43.920
I'll choose
some warriors.

10:43.960 --> 10:44.920
I'll see
what I can do.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.000
But it must wait
till nightfall.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.520
Thank you.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.200
has she passed your way?

12:42.240 --> 12:44.520
Taleisin...

12:44.560 --> 12:48.640
do they sing of her already?

12:52.560 --> 12:54.880
If she breathes...

12:55.800 --> 12:57.160
show me where.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.480
Show me.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.960
Gods of air, and river,
and dark below,

13:04.000 --> 13:05.320
where is she?

13:14.320 --> 13:15.640
Of course.

13:44.880 --> 13:45.680
[sighs]

13:50.880 --> 13:52.440
Aw, f--

13:52.480 --> 13:53.840
Praise to Epona,

13:53.880 --> 13:56.600
our thanks for this meal
you have blessed us with.

13:56.640 --> 13:57.840
Yesterday,

13:57.880 --> 13:59.920
I'm washing
outside the tent,

13:59.960 --> 14:02.560
this kid squats

14:02.600 --> 14:04.440
and dumps one
right next to me.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.720
You told me.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.240
And it wasn't yesterday,
it was the day before.

14:08.280 --> 14:13.120
These are the only people
who the gods speak to.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.280
You said that too.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.800
Then you shook your head,

14:15.840 --> 14:17.240
and said,
"Someone's having--

14:17.280 --> 14:19.840
Someone is having
a fucking laugh.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.000
And I said,

14:21.040 --> 14:22.440
"They live simply.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.720
They don't pretend to be
anything other than spirit,

14:23.760 --> 14:27.200
and all the spirit needs
is a blanket and food."

14:28.920 --> 14:30.040
Four moons,

14:30.080 --> 14:31.720
and still
he won't speak to us.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.520
Starting to worry?
Because I am.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.240
Nature takes its time.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.280
He hasn't even said hello.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.040
He barely comes out of his tent,

14:39.080 --> 14:41.240
and when he does,
his eyes are like this.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.040
I bet he doesn't even
know we're here.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.440
He knows.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.440
Oh, what, he makes all
the goddesses wait, does he?

14:47.480 --> 14:48.880
Doing nothing?

14:48.920 --> 14:50.320
You may be
doing nothing.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.000
I'm busy forging a destiny.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.960
[woman approaching]
Fancy a fuck?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.560
Oh, don't mind me.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.600
My body is unpollutable
until the birth.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.160
We're all aware
of that, thank you.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.600
You can have both of us.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.680
Don't take this
the wrong way.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.040
Same answer
as yesterday.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.160
Suit yourself.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.120
If you change your mind...

15:10.160 --> 15:11.960
Thank you.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.040
[sighs]

15:17.080 --> 15:19.200
I can't stay here any longer.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.640
He knows
we're here.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.440
Besides,

15:22.480 --> 15:24.280
he doesn't summon us,

15:24.320 --> 15:25.440
the gods do.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.560
Stick a knife in me, you witch!

15:41.600 --> 15:42.480
Open wide.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.120
Breathe.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.840
[muffled sobbing]

16:09.960 --> 16:12.920
[breath hissing hollowly]

16:29.800 --> 16:31.120
Hey!

16:33.240 --> 16:34.120
Right, go on! Shoo!

16:34.160 --> 16:36.000
Not here!

16:36.040 --> 16:37.360
Shoo!

16:38.520 --> 16:40.720
Somewhere else, go on!

16:43.160 --> 16:45.520
[ruefully] King Phelan.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.600
King of the Cantii.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.080
You a druid?

16:51.120 --> 16:52.520
Do I look like a druid?

16:52.560 --> 16:54.120
Where's Veran?

17:00.760 --> 17:02.120
In that tent,

17:02.160 --> 17:03.840
since the summer.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.400
But he's busy, not available,

17:05.440 --> 17:07.760
so good luck with that,
just generally.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.839
What do you want?

17:10.880 --> 17:13.160
I'm looking for Veran.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.280
Who wants to speak
with The Second Man?

17:15.319 --> 17:16.280
Me.

17:17.240 --> 17:20.200
Follow.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.839
What the fucking fuck?

17:23.880 --> 17:26.240
[exhaling while couple moans]

17:32.560 --> 17:34.240
What is it you bring me?

17:34.280 --> 17:35.680
I don't bring things,
I sell them.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.000
What are you selling?

17:38.040 --> 17:39.720
Something I found.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.200
Swinging in the forest.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.560
Where is it?

17:46.600 --> 17:47.800
Nearby.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.280
There's a problem.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.560
What problem?

17:50.600 --> 17:52.320
The Romans.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.520
And what did
the Roman offer you?

17:55.800 --> 17:56.920
Half the Empire,

17:56.960 --> 18:00.200
sprinkled with rubies,
on a big golden stick.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.240
[neck bones crack]

18:02.400 --> 18:04.400
And that's not enough?

18:04.440 --> 18:05.400
Depends.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.320
On what?

18:06.360 --> 18:07.760
On what you're willing to pay.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.720
Right now I'm hoping
you only look

18:09.760 --> 18:11.800
like a stinking
penniless beggar.

18:15.760 --> 18:16.880
Where is she?

18:16.920 --> 18:18.840
I told you, nearby.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.440
Alive?

18:20.480 --> 18:23.280
Let's hope so.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.520
I get it now.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.600
I get it.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.520
Get what?

18:29.560 --> 18:30.800
How it all works around here.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.240
How's that?

18:32.280 --> 18:33.240
If you want
something,

18:33.280 --> 18:34.560
if you have
a genuine need,

18:34.600 --> 18:36.440
a genuine case,

18:36.480 --> 18:37.480
then they fuck with you.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.760
But... act like
you don't need them,

18:39.800 --> 18:41.960
and then
they're all over you.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.240
I've seen them
turn into eagles and fly.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.280
Good.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.360
Because after waiting
this long,

18:46.400 --> 18:48.920
that is the very least I expect.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.800
[bag lands heavily,
jingling with gold]

19:23.240 --> 19:25.360
She's in the ground
half a mile north of here.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.520
A stand of oaks
where the river bends.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.160
I know the place.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.080
There's a rock at her feet
and a reed at her head.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.720
Pleasure doing business.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.560
It's easy doing business
with the soulless.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.520
Yeah, I'm bored now.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.280
What if she's lying?

19:48.920 --> 19:50.120
She speaks the truth.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.640
Wait for the rising moon.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.080
The first thing she'll see.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.520
It's time to talk.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.840
Tell the General that
I'll speak with him.

20:24.880 --> 20:25.840
Don't do it.

20:25.880 --> 20:26.640
Why?

20:26.680 --> 20:27.680
Don't go to them.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.160
You told me
to accept his offer--

20:29.200 --> 20:30.480
He'll devour you.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.960
It's too late for talking.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.760
They know it's over.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.840
What can you offer?

20:34.880 --> 20:37.840
Yourself?
Is that it?

20:39.280 --> 20:41.680
You think that's
written here?

20:43.480 --> 20:45.560
This girl you say
you helped,

20:45.600 --> 20:46.640
with the blind father,

20:46.680 --> 20:49.120
this chosen one...

20:49.160 --> 20:51.320
where does that leave you?

20:51.360 --> 20:53.800
A sacrifice
to some prophesy?

20:55.080 --> 20:56.520
Is that what you want?

21:02.200 --> 21:03.760
He'll see you now.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.280
Follow me.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.480
Enough, child.

21:27.560 --> 21:31.560
I am Ania, daughter
of Bann and Danu,

21:31.600 --> 21:33.320
but I go by another name,

21:33.360 --> 21:34.960
a name you know well.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.640
My true name is Brenna.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.120
I was raised by the Regni,

21:39.160 --> 21:43.000
but always knew the presence
of my real parents.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.160
Now I am with child
by the golden-haired one,

21:45.200 --> 21:47.720
and the prophecy
shall be fulfilled.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.080
Prophecy?

21:49.120 --> 21:50.080
You wrote it
yourself,

21:50.120 --> 21:52.640
on the face of my ancestor,

21:52.680 --> 21:53.840
2,000 moons ago--

21:53.880 --> 21:55.160
2,004.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.880
The prophecy tells
that Brenna shall be rescued

21:58.920 --> 22:00.240
by a golden-haired mortal,

22:00.280 --> 22:02.720
and together
they will spawn a pantheon

22:02.760 --> 22:04.960
to rule the heavens
for a thousand years.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.800
You would bear gods?

22:09.840 --> 22:11.480
If that is my destiny.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.400
Do you also
accept this destiny,

22:15.440 --> 22:17.400
should it be so?

22:17.440 --> 22:19.480
I want to know
the will of the gods.

22:19.520 --> 22:23.440
You, who are
thousands of moons old,

22:23.480 --> 22:25.760
who have always guided us,

22:25.800 --> 22:27.080
shown us the right path,

22:27.120 --> 22:28.360
the path to the Divine,

22:28.400 --> 22:32.000
tell us, Second Man,

22:32.040 --> 22:35.440
are we made of light?

22:35.480 --> 22:37.600
We would know your answer.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.280
[gasping, entranced]

22:48.280 --> 22:51.000
I must speak with the gods now.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.400
[Cait gasping for breath]

23:28.440 --> 23:31.840
[♪♪♪]

23:44.240 --> 23:46.560
The prophecy is true...

23:48.560 --> 23:50.320
But it's not your prophecy.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.040
What?

23:52.080 --> 23:55.320
You are not
its vessel.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.680
It has not come to pass.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.000
It may not for a thousand years.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.040
I only know this,

24:02.080 --> 24:04.200
you are not Brenna.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.800
You are not a goddess.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.840
You are Ania of the Regni.

24:08.880 --> 24:09.880
You lie.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.200
Gods never lie.

24:11.240 --> 24:12.160
I don't believe you.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.320
You lie. You're a liar.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.760
[sobbing]

24:19.800 --> 24:22.320
[♪♪♪]

24:36.200 --> 24:37.560
The troops are massing.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.600
At least let me come with you.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.080
No, I must do this alone.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.840
Kerra...

24:47.280 --> 24:49.680
I've done your tribe
nothing but harm.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.720
It was me
who burned the grain store.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.360
I came here
not to forge bonds,

24:58.400 --> 24:59.480
but to poison.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.840
It was the Druids' bidding.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.560
The Druids decreed it,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.360
and I obeyed.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.360
I understand.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.360
I took food from your mouth.

25:14.400 --> 25:17.400
And saved us one,
two moons of vain hope.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.920
Will you not have me punished?

25:20.960 --> 25:23.880
Those of us who do
the Druids' bidding

25:23.920 --> 25:25.720
are already cast to the wind.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.920
Goodbye, Lindon.

25:41.560 --> 25:44.480
[♪♪♪]

26:10.840 --> 26:13.080
[Cait panting in fear]

26:19.920 --> 26:21.280
It is her.

26:44.320 --> 26:47.240
I only came to protect her.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.160
Is that the only reason
you came?

26:50.080 --> 26:51.720
The Prophecy...

26:53.400 --> 26:54.720
I need to know.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.680
What happens?

26:56.720 --> 26:58.480
Veran. Veran...

26:58.520 --> 26:59.400
please.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.360
Veran!

27:00.400 --> 27:02.440
[seething]

27:07.600 --> 27:11.080
I need to know
what happens next.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.840
You want to know
what happens next?

27:15.880 --> 27:17.480
[♪♪♪]

27:29.040 --> 27:33.040
You were right, Father.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.320
You were right.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.360
[heavy stomp of marching feet]

28:09.240 --> 28:12.080
Patience, your Majesty.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.480
Hungry?

28:39.720 --> 28:41.960
These are really
rather good.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.720
The Cantii surrender.

28:44.760 --> 28:47.440
The fortress is yours,
on one condition.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.640
Oh.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.800
And what's that?

28:52.840 --> 28:54.840
The guaranteed safety
of my people.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.720
Not a single Cantii
will be harmed.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.560
Do I have your word?

28:58.600 --> 29:00.040
Well, now,

29:00.080 --> 29:02.440
that wasn't so hard, was it?

29:02.480 --> 29:04.600
Hmm?

29:04.640 --> 29:06.840
All this suffering,

29:06.880 --> 29:09.080
all this pain,

29:09.120 --> 29:11.040
for months and months.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.640
[chuckles]

29:12.680 --> 29:14.400
If only your father
had listened, huh,

29:14.440 --> 29:17.400
seen the bigger picture...

29:18.920 --> 29:22.600
But then you and I would
never have met, would we?

29:24.600 --> 29:28.160
It seems the gods
have plans for all of us,

29:28.200 --> 29:29.800
wouldn't you say?

29:29.840 --> 29:32.200
Do I have your word?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.240
There's just one small problem.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.600
Your ally, Antedia.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.160
You know, I have seen
some grim things in my time,

29:44.200 --> 29:45.920
but what she's got planned
for you...

29:45.960 --> 29:48.400
If you guarantee
the safety of my people,

29:48.440 --> 29:50.600
I will give myself over to her.

29:50.640 --> 29:53.720
Well, that would
certainly sweeten the deal.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.480
Make things easier
for all of us.

30:00.960 --> 30:04.240
Your people will sleep
with full bellies tonight,

30:04.280 --> 30:07.440
wake up in the morning
to a new dawn.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.360
On behalf of the Emperor,

30:10.400 --> 30:13.160
I accept the terms
of your surrender.

30:14.880 --> 30:18.760
With one condition
of my own.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.120
And what is that?

30:24.200 --> 30:27.880
[whispering]
Let me show you...

30:27.920 --> 30:31.000
how the Empire really works.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.720
Are you watching?

30:46.200 --> 30:48.240
What are you doing?

30:49.680 --> 30:50.880

[smirking]

34:20.600 --> 34:22.960
Where is she?

34:25.320 --> 34:27.080
I don't know where she is.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.840
You helped her escape.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.560
Now, you tell me.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.280
If you want her
more than these lands,

34:37.320 --> 34:38.800
more than this fortress,

34:38.840 --> 34:41.120
then that means
that she's powerful,

34:41.159 --> 34:42.280
she's a threat,

34:42.320 --> 34:44.040
and as long as she is out there,

34:44.080 --> 34:46.360
you haven't won.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.080
You haven't won.

34:51.159 --> 34:53.440
Now, this...

34:53.480 --> 34:55.080
is your last chance.

34:56.080 --> 34:57.240
Where is she?

34:57.280 --> 34:58.800
She's out there.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.680
If your tongue won't tell me,

35:02.720 --> 35:04.760
then I will ask your heart.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.560
[tearing fabric]

35:11.840 --> 35:14.520
Go back to hell.

[♪♪♪]

36:54.000 --> 36:56.040
Sorry.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.760
I've decided to stay.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.120
I need to learn.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.040
Me too.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.920
But not here.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.800
Goodbye, Phelan.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.160
T-Take care of...

37:24.200 --> 37:26.640
I will.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.720
We'll meet again.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.680
What makes you so sure?

37:33.720 --> 37:36.840
I can feel it in my bones.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.680
She's staying?

38:04.720 --> 38:06.520
Yes.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.600
The gods have a fate
for all of us.

38:08.640 --> 38:12.080
You must find yours.

38:12.120 --> 38:15.160
But there is a light
in this world.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.240
A new light.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.480
The flame is small now,

38:19.520 --> 38:20.960
and the winds are strong,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.640
but it burns.

38:23.680 --> 38:24.760
It's out there.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.760
Somewhere.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.520
It is now your task to find it.

38:29.560 --> 38:32.080
If you can find that light,

38:32.120 --> 38:34.200
and protect it,

38:34.240 --> 38:35.880
and help it grow,

38:35.920 --> 38:38.160
it will grow strong.

38:38.200 --> 38:40.560
Stronger than Kings.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.200
Stronger than Empires...

38:48.360 --> 38:51.440
[Amena] The Age of the Druids
is over.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.160
The gods are dead...

39:31.480 --> 39:34.080
Lie down in the light,
Phelan of the Cantii.

39:34.120 --> 39:37.320
Lie down in the light.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.800
The voices,

39:41.840 --> 39:43.480
all singing,

39:43.520 --> 39:46.000
