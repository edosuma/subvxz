01:36.671 --> 01:38.304
Come on man.
She's 18, she's going to college

01:38.307 --> 01:41.007
I know, I'm her father.

01:41.010 --> 01:42.208
She's got a job.

01:42.211 --> 01:43.409
She is my daughter.

01:43.412 --> 01:44.911
But you gotta let her go.

01:44.914 --> 01:46.845
She's still my little angel.

01:46.848 --> 01:49.548
She needs time,
you're just not focusing on us.

01:49.551 --> 01:50.549
Let's keep drinking.

01:50.552 --> 01:52.018
Nasdarovia.

01:52.021 --> 01:53.685
My car,
you haven't fixed my car!

01:53.688 --> 01:55.724
I got it, I got it. Almost done.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.757
Nasdarovia.

02:19.681 --> 02:23.317
Out of all days, why today?

02:24.487 --> 02:26.651
I feel like something is off.

02:26.654 --> 02:28.287
Nothing is wrong.

02:28.290 --> 02:29.956
They called ahead

02:29.959 --> 02:32.091
and said he just wanted
to inspect the operation.

02:32.094 --> 02:34.460
I've been working with this man
for 12 years.

02:34.463 --> 02:36.295
Now he wants to inspect it.

02:36.298 --> 02:37.699
Stay out of your head.

02:51.579 --> 02:53.514
I can't find it.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.016
It was on pages about property.

02:57.019 --> 02:59.754
We went over that
already. Look, you're a mechanic.

03:00.356 --> 03:02.523
I'm sure you have
other tool boxes in your shop.

03:02.657 --> 03:04.893
Toolbox is very special to me.

03:05.061 --> 03:06.625
She's keeping it out of spite.

03:06.628 --> 03:07.929
Look at her face.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.809
Oh shit.

03:21.310 --> 03:22.543
Don't worry.

03:22.710 --> 03:24.377
You're a genius, ok?

03:24.380 --> 03:26.512
And once he sees
how you've built this place

03:26.515 --> 03:28.116
he's going to be so happy.

03:29.385 --> 03:30.618
I guarantee it.

03:33.989 --> 03:35.821
It's almost Christmas.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.727
I thought maybe
I can sell the toolbox.

03:39.228 --> 03:42.030
Mr. Gradenko,
the toolbox is going to Max.

03:42.565 --> 03:44.165
It's non negotiable
at this point.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.533
Let me think about it.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.767
[Arbite} Mr. Gradenko, you
cannot leave my table like that.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.972
Yes I can.

04:07.056 --> 04:09.824
When you get there,
pay attention to this guy.

04:11.060 --> 04:13.460
Then you tell me
if you see something suspicious.

04:14.597 --> 04:16.430
I don't trust this guy
very much.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.205
Ahh, gentlemen.

04:28.344 --> 04:30.409
Welcome

04:30.412 --> 04:32.646
to eight Jefferson ave.

05:39.281 --> 05:41.380
Hey, Sam wants to see you
as soon as you can.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.915
Sam? Why?

05:42.918 --> 05:44.317
I don't know.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.754
How did he seem?

05:46.055 --> 05:47.989
He seemed like Stan.

05:48.090 --> 05:49.623
Great.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.964
Can I get a pina colada
and a rum and coke, please?

05:57.732 --> 05:59.065
Gentlemen, help yourselves to.

05:59.068 --> 06:00.168
Thank you.

06:06.275 --> 06:08.007
Please-

06:08.010 --> 06:09.542
scotch on the rocks
with splash of water.

06:09.545 --> 06:10.576
Yes sir.

06:10.579 --> 06:11.913
And...

06:14.617 --> 06:16.583
Gentlemen.

06:19.455 --> 06:21.289
I've spent a lot of money
on this business.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.788
Yes, yes you have.

06:23.791 --> 06:25.591
But as you can see here

06:25.594 --> 06:27.896
we've also returned amazing

06:28.197 --> 06:30.265
and above and beyond profits

06:30.933 --> 06:33.034
what any investor
or businessman would dream of...

06:35.037 --> 06:36.871
If you see here
some of the stats.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.875
You think I don't know
what my businesses make?

06:49.218 --> 06:51.984
If it wasn't for you,
I don't know what I'd do.

06:51.987 --> 06:53.619
You're Miami's
best kept secret, bro.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.655
I told you car is ready.

06:55.658 --> 06:57.657
Incredible! I swear
nobody can do it like you.

06:57.660 --> 06:59.060
Man, the horsepower, the torque!

06:59.695 --> 07:02.161
I don't know how you manage
to put this together! Like-

07:02.164 --> 07:03.996
that's why
they pay me big bucks.

07:03.999 --> 07:05.666
Damn bro.

07:07.202 --> 07:10.972
Yeah man, seriously though, like
you all right here, bro?

07:11.006 --> 07:12.871
It just looks a little bit more

07:12.874 --> 07:15.007
quieter than it used to be?

07:15.010 --> 07:17.846
A little bit slow...
I will be ok.

07:34.363 --> 07:36.197
Hey, Ashley said
you wanted to see me.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.100
Come have a seat, Julia.

07:40.602 --> 07:42.103
What do I always tell you?

07:47.443 --> 07:49.442
It doesn't matter
if you're smart

07:49.445 --> 07:51.346
or hot, it's all about
who you know.

07:52.614 --> 07:56.315
Exactly, and I always did say
to you that I was

07:56.318 --> 07:58.953
going to be a really good person
for you to know, didn't I?

08:00.189 --> 08:02.656
This is Vaughn Jacobs.

08:02.658 --> 08:04.223
Vaughn is a talent agent,

08:04.226 --> 08:06.058
but he's also a developer

08:06.061 --> 08:07.929
of social media influencers.

08:07.996 --> 08:09.861
Just like me,

08:09.864 --> 08:12.133
he's got a real eye
for talent and beauty

08:12.167 --> 08:13.999
and he asked me to set up

08:14.002 --> 08:15.870
a conversation now...

08:16.305 --> 08:18.273
Yes,
and what Stan is getting at is.

08:19.241 --> 08:21.075
You have the look
and presence for this...

08:23.178 --> 08:24.679
You are so beautiful.

08:25.647 --> 08:27.882
You could be an asset
in my line of work.

08:27.950 --> 08:29.250
Believe me.

08:30.085 --> 08:32.320
I have a special eye for this...

08:34.723 --> 08:36.891
You're doing a fine job,
Mr. Camp.

08:37.493 --> 08:38.557
It's camp isn't it?

08:38.560 --> 08:40.028
Correct.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.228
I have a very important client

08:42.231 --> 08:43.898
coming to town this week.

08:45.134 --> 08:49.204
This particular client
demands top quality merchandise.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.341
And I'm going to trust you,
to find that merchandise.

08:54.710 --> 08:56.211
Can I count on you?

08:59.114 --> 09:00.982
I'm all ears.

09:04.052 --> 09:06.085
You don't ever miss
the old life, man?

09:06.088 --> 09:07.889
You and me,
we was running shit, bro.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.491
Not for a second.

09:12.661 --> 09:14.827
That's why I always had a
different respect for you, man.

09:14.830 --> 09:17.098
I look up to you.

09:17.132 --> 09:18.933
It might not be much, but...

09:21.437 --> 09:22.134
Luis.

09:22.137 --> 09:24.437
It's not a tip, just think of it

09:24.440 --> 09:27.640
as shashlik for muscle, protein.

09:27.643 --> 09:30.075
You're built like a tank, so you
probably need it more than I do.

09:30.078 --> 09:30.911
Thanks brother.

09:30.914 --> 09:32.280
Yo man.

09:34.183 --> 09:36.148
Call me man, whatever you
need you know I got you.

09:36.151 --> 09:38.353
Thank you.

09:39.154 --> 09:40.888
This is a beast, though!

09:41.056 --> 09:42.790
You nailed this muthafucker!

09:43.459 --> 09:45.393
My guy, call me!

09:50.199 --> 09:51.966
Have you done modeling
or acting before?

09:52.734 --> 09:55.134
Actually, I have.

09:55.137 --> 09:58.239
I was Clara in the
nutcracker at our church.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.539
I've always wanted to be

10:00.542 --> 10:02.775
this like,
famous actress... but...

10:02.778 --> 10:05.480
I guess so do all little girls.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.783
Ok listen, if you are open to it.

10:10.052 --> 10:11.851
I'd love you to be a part
on a shoot?

10:11.854 --> 10:12.985
What do you say?

10:12.988 --> 10:15.521
I say yes.

10:15.524 --> 10:17.892
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.297
Thank you.

10:24.099 --> 10:25.433
Hey.

10:32.774 --> 10:33.772
The Hammond.

10:33.775 --> 10:35.109
8:00 pm

10:35.879 --> 10:37.209
show this at the door.

10:37.212 --> 10:38.846
They'll let you right in.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.614
Thank you, thank you so much.

10:41.617 --> 10:44.018
Ciau Bella.

10:49.725 --> 10:51.457
You know...

10:51.460 --> 10:53.025
There's a lot more
girls like that

10:53.028 --> 10:54.862
where she came from.

10:57.232 --> 10:59.133
Do you need any black girls?

11:05.841 --> 11:07.208
Oh my god.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.311
Jacobs modeling agency?
Are you going to go?

11:10.679 --> 11:12.547
I mean, I want to.

11:12.982 --> 11:15.648
Come on, you have to go.

11:15.651 --> 11:18.584
This is an amazing opportunity,
but hey, if you don't want to go

11:18.587 --> 11:21.387
that's fine.
You can give me that card.

11:21.390 --> 11:24.092
Because you know I want to party
with the rich and famous.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.106
Hey.

11:38.373 --> 11:39.772
I notice you were out

11:39.775 --> 11:41.975
until 5:00 am again!

11:41.978 --> 11:44.078
Please, don't remind me...

11:44.212 --> 11:45.646
Was it Eric or Noah?

11:46.381 --> 11:48.113
You think Noah could
keep me up that late?

11:48.116 --> 11:50.184
It was Omar, anyway.

11:51.453 --> 11:53.719
Girl, you change your men
way more often than you change

11:53.722 --> 11:55.154
your underwear.

11:55.157 --> 11:56.657
I know, but...
Where are you going?

11:57.526 --> 11:59.527
I'm going to
video chat with my dad.

11:59.896 --> 12:04.763
Ok! Your hot, muscly dad?

12:04.766 --> 12:07.633
Can I watch?

12:07.636 --> 12:09.637
Gross!
Don't you have homework to do?

12:11.239 --> 12:13.975
Oh yes. I forgot about that.

12:34.196 --> 12:36.328
Hello my little angel.

12:36.331 --> 12:37.699
Hi papa.

12:37.833 --> 12:39.467
How are you?

12:39.701 --> 12:42.201
Tired. I got off
shift super late and

12:42.204 --> 12:44.470
you were blowing up
my phone the whole time!

12:44.473 --> 12:45.972
I thought you weren't
gonna do that anymore.

12:45.975 --> 12:48.942
Sometimes I'm so worried.

12:48.945 --> 12:51.210
You got nothing to worry
about, you raised a strong girl,

12:51.213 --> 12:52.879
just give it time.

12:52.882 --> 12:55.949
Time...

12:55.952 --> 12:58.186
That's what I don't have
anymore, Julia, time.

12:58.487 --> 13:01.322
Don't say that papa!

13:01.657 --> 13:03.324
I'm excited
for Christmas together.

13:03.525 --> 13:05.193
I already got your present.

13:05.227 --> 13:07.359
As long as we stay together

13:07.362 --> 13:09.363
that's the only present
I will need.

13:09.731 --> 13:11.132
I love you.

13:12.135 --> 13:13.967
I love you too, baby.

13:13.970 --> 13:16.069
Ok papa, I'll call you tomorrow
on my lunch break.

13:16.072 --> 13:17.405
Yes you will.

13:18.273 --> 13:19.338
Bye.

13:19.341 --> 13:20.742
Bye baby.

13:34.957 --> 13:37.656
Gentlemen,
thank you for waiting.

13:37.659 --> 13:39.260
Welcome to the sunshine state.

13:42.965 --> 13:46.198
My boss wants to know when
we're going to get the shipment.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.568
When need the girls
by Christmas.

13:48.403 --> 13:52.039
Wait. No "hello",
no "how are you?", nothing?

13:52.041 --> 13:54.174
We gave you a deposit

13:54.177 --> 13:56.976
and he wants to know how long
you're going to keep him waiting

13:56.979 --> 13:58.646
I just welcomed you to my house.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.615
Yeah yeah yeah... but.

14:02.919 --> 14:06.119
Look we don't have
time for this. My boss-

14:06.122 --> 14:07.221
your boss.

14:07.689 --> 14:10.091
Is one of many, many clients

14:10.159 --> 14:11.760
one I don't particularly need.

14:12.294 --> 14:14.262
So, you should be more...

14:14.296 --> 14:16.130
Cordial.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.667
Bullshit, my boss... arghhh!

14:20.368 --> 14:22.136
Fuck!

14:24.239 --> 14:26.973
Go ahead, take two.

14:26.976 --> 14:29.542
But cordial this time, try it.

14:29.544 --> 14:31.612
Hello, how are you?

14:31.981 --> 14:34.615
Hello how are you?

14:35.817 --> 14:38.383
Say: You have a lovely house.

14:40.756 --> 14:43.124
You have a lovely house.

14:43.692 --> 14:45.827
You see, that's cordial, I agree.

14:46.828 --> 14:49.028
But why the fuck

14:49.031 --> 14:51.767
are you getting blood
in my beautiful floors?

15:12.121 --> 15:13.789
You tell your boss

15:13.956 --> 15:15.323
the shipment is ready.

15:17.325 --> 15:19.126
That I need his business,

15:19.228 --> 15:20.960
but he should be more careful

15:20.963 --> 15:22.831
with the caliber of
messengers he sends.

15:23.765 --> 15:24.864
You got it?

15:24.866 --> 15:26.835
Yeah. Yeah!

15:35.443 --> 15:37.378
You have to clean up this mess.

15:38.247 --> 15:40.181
It's gonna be buffet night.

15:40.515 --> 15:42.450
Are the alligator farm.

15:53.395 --> 15:55.363
Oh yes...

15:56.598 --> 15:58.566
That's what I'm talking about.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.329
Crime scene photos
from Miami beach police

16:29.332 --> 16:31.797
begin to tell
the story of human trafficking.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.632
Women branded by
their pimps and traffickers

16:33.635 --> 16:35.301
wearing the same tattoos

16:35.304 --> 16:37.736
as the men accused
of exploiting them.

16:37.739 --> 16:40.574
Women beaten when they
fail to meet cash quotas for sex

16:41.244 --> 16:44.245
Miami beach is
a huge destination for them.

16:44.679 --> 16:45.879
Detectives working to uncover

16:45.882 --> 16:47.280
human trafficking.

16:47.283 --> 16:48.950
See this crime
all over the city.

16:50.119 --> 16:51.920
Merry Christmas.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.923
Be sexy for me for me babe.

16:56.625 --> 16:58.392
Yes, come on.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.327
A little bit more...

17:03.132 --> 17:04.700
Yes.

17:06.002 --> 17:09.468
In Miami beach human
traffickers, like cold hard cash

17:09.471 --> 17:12.105
was a man with
a stable of women in his grasp.

17:12.108 --> 17:14.806
They do come to the tourist area

17:14.809 --> 17:17.442
it's a special
city there's a lot of money here.

17:17.445 --> 17:19.145
Detectives say
the men target vulnerable women

17:19.148 --> 17:20.548
to become sex workers.

17:27.622 --> 17:29.355
Detectives say the men target

17:29.358 --> 17:31.257
vulnerable women
to become sex workers,

17:31.260 --> 17:32.926
and the traffickers know just

17:32.929 --> 17:35.361
what to say to earn
the victim's trust.

17:35.364 --> 17:38.430
They feed them lies
they say are going to make them rich.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.699
But really the only
person that ever benefits

17:40.702 --> 17:42.834
from them
doing this is the pimp himself.

17:42.837 --> 17:45.473
Miami beach
police say these are...

18:13.568 --> 18:15.168
Hey!

18:15.171 --> 18:17.270
Hey!

18:17.273 --> 18:18.704
Get your sweet ass over here

18:18.707 --> 18:20.508
and give me another round drink.

18:26.082 --> 18:28.014
I saw that.

18:28.017 --> 18:30.482
Are you afraid
I'm not going to give you a tip?

18:30.485 --> 18:32.318
Excuse me.

18:32.321 --> 18:34.253
That's right.
Come on over here, darling.

18:34.256 --> 18:36.022
I'll give you more than a tip...

18:36.025 --> 18:37.522
I'll give you the whole thing.

18:37.525 --> 18:38.690
Listen:

18:38.693 --> 18:40.826
You already paid your tab...

18:40.829 --> 18:43.562
I am not giving you another
drink. You need to go.

18:43.565 --> 18:45.000
Go now.

18:45.533 --> 18:47.333
Hey hon, what are you having?

18:47.336 --> 18:49.838
Vodka, double shot. No ice.

18:49.972 --> 18:51.438
Please.

18:51.539 --> 18:53.041
Don't walk away from me.

18:53.409 --> 18:54.709
You know I am?

19:03.185 --> 19:06.387
Some people
can't handle their alcohol.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.322
Anything else?

19:09.325 --> 19:12.727
I don't want
to embarrass my daughter.

19:13.229 --> 19:14.394
Maybe you can help.

19:14.397 --> 19:16.530
Ok, who's your daughter?

19:19.135 --> 19:20.599
She works here

19:20.602 --> 19:22.103
Julia gradenko.

19:22.637 --> 19:24.870
Oh, Julia, we love her.

19:24.873 --> 19:27.474
Wait, you're her dad?

19:28.277 --> 19:32.013
I don't want her to be
embarrassed because I'm here.

19:32.515 --> 19:33.982
She didn't call.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.051
I'm too worried.

19:37.053 --> 19:39.018
No, don't worry,
I won't tell her.

19:39.021 --> 19:40.386
Please don't tell her

19:40.389 --> 19:42.523
I won't, I understand

19:43.059 --> 19:45.525
but listen, she went to that
photo shoot last night

19:45.528 --> 19:48.727
and she went out with a
couple of people that she met.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.430
She called in today
asked me to cover her.

19:50.433 --> 19:53.032
Where did she go?

19:53.035 --> 19:55.468
She's just going out
she sounded kind of drunk

19:55.471 --> 19:57.970
but I told her take an uber home

19:57.973 --> 19:59.738
but she was really excited,
so I don't know.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.240
Maybe she met a guy?

20:01.243 --> 20:03.011
Does she drink?

20:03.245 --> 20:04.779
Actually...

20:05.414 --> 20:07.947
No, like never,

20:07.950 --> 20:09.815
but like I said,
she was really excited.

20:09.818 --> 20:11.920
So maybe, she was celebrating?

20:12.654 --> 20:13.652
Thank you, thank you so much.

20:13.655 --> 20:15.123
Keep it.

20:15.491 --> 20:16.456
Thank you so much.

20:16.459 --> 20:18.760
Thank you. Bye.

20:29.804 --> 20:32.506
Hi Yuri, come on in how are you?

20:33.075 --> 20:35.740
I'm sorry for the late visit.

20:35.743 --> 20:38.311
I'm trying to get
a hold of Julia.

20:38.314 --> 20:40.181
She had that photo
shoot at the Hammond.

20:40.849 --> 20:43.084
Have you ever tried
"find my phone"?

20:43.685 --> 20:45.754
What is "find my phone"?

20:47.856 --> 20:50.692
Oh look, it came online.

20:51.227 --> 20:56.628
She's at the Hammond
maybe the're still there

20:56.631 --> 20:58.767
makeup, hair and stuff.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.669
I really don't know
how long that takes.

21:02.004 --> 21:04.773
Maybe you would
totally be interrupting.

21:06.875 --> 21:08.474
Her friend at work

21:08.477 --> 21:10.979
said she sounded drunk.

21:12.714 --> 21:14.581
Julie never drinks.

21:16.552 --> 21:18.619
Can you text this on my phone?

21:19.654 --> 21:21.923
I think I can, yeah.

21:22.958 --> 21:24.759
I will go check it out.

21:49.952 --> 21:51.350
Hey, what it do, bro?

21:51.353 --> 21:52.451
What's popping brother?

21:52.454 --> 21:53.685
Chilling, man...

21:53.688 --> 21:55.621
Hey, what the fuck is that?

21:55.624 --> 21:58.357
Hey, get the fuck out of here
get him out of here!

21:58.360 --> 21:59.959
No guns, no knives, bro.

21:59.962 --> 22:01.730
Hey what it do bro? Chilling?

22:02.932 --> 22:04.899
Very nice, get out of here.

22:05.334 --> 22:06.801
'Sup bro?

23:07.762 --> 23:09.362
What can I get you?

23:09.365 --> 23:11.800
Vodka, double shot,
no ice. Please.

23:11.967 --> 23:12.932
Thank you.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.202
You're welcome.

24:23.772 --> 24:24.770
Hey!

24:24.773 --> 24:26.241
Hey!

24:28.977 --> 24:31.012
The fuck you doing back here?

24:33.716 --> 24:36.084
Listen. Maybe you can help.

24:36.218 --> 24:37.852
I'm looking for my daughter.

24:38.287 --> 24:40.553
Fuck your daughter. What
are you doing up here.

24:40.556 --> 24:43.758
I said,
I need to get into that room.

24:44.259 --> 24:46.258
You ain't going nowhere
motherfucker.

24:46.261 --> 24:48.160
What the fuck
do you think this is?

24:48.163 --> 24:50.329
Ok, good for you, I go.

24:50.332 --> 24:52.167
No, you ain't going nowhere.

25:13.922 --> 25:15.423
Like I said

25:15.791 --> 25:18.126
I need to get into that room.

27:34.296 --> 27:36.331
I need to speak to the manager.

27:37.666 --> 27:39.865
Sure, right away.

27:41.603 --> 27:44.972
Very impressive.

27:47.911 --> 27:50.378
What's that? Like ten assaults
in under five minutes?

27:51.780 --> 27:53.881
Maybe a murder or two?

27:58.520 --> 28:00.621
Please, we're going to
clean all this up for you.

28:01.456 --> 28:03.591
It's almost a shame
that we met under these terms.

28:04.226 --> 28:06.160
I just want to deflate this
negative energy.

28:07.663 --> 28:09.361
I'm thinking
you and I should speak

28:09.364 --> 28:11.065
in more of a private setting.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.286
Get up.

28:33.155 --> 28:35.256
Get him the fuck off the ground,
get up!

28:35.925 --> 28:37.592
Get him off the fucking ground.

29:16.164 --> 29:18.166
Who the fuck are you?

29:20.736 --> 29:23.237
Mikey, back at the club.

29:25.674 --> 29:27.608
He's fucking dead
because of you.

29:29.045 --> 29:30.478
I fucking liked him.

29:31.914 --> 29:33.682
Tell me where my daughter is.

29:34.349 --> 29:36.050
And I won't kill you.

29:38.121 --> 29:39.954
That's rich.

29:44.459 --> 29:45.824
You know the bullsharks

29:45.827 --> 29:48.094
are extra active
this time of year.

29:48.097 --> 29:51.132
They can come out there on
a moonlit night just like this.

29:52.267 --> 29:54.368
And fish for them right
off the rocks over here.

29:56.271 --> 29:59.173
Just a couple drops of blood

29:59.341 --> 30:01.175
and it lures them right in...

30:03.345 --> 30:05.177
Fuck you!

30:05.180 --> 30:06.682
Yeah? Fuck you!

32:07.236 --> 32:08.569
Julia.

32:09.437 --> 32:10.772
Julia.

32:11.274 --> 32:12.172
Wake up, sweetheart.

32:12.175 --> 32:13.541
Where am I?

32:14.043 --> 32:15.275
What happened?

32:15.278 --> 32:16.845
Here, sit up a little bit.

32:17.712 --> 32:19.647
Drink this, it'll help
clear your head up a bit.

32:20.950 --> 32:23.184
It will get rid
of the shaking too.

32:23.785 --> 32:25.018
Where am I?

32:25.021 --> 32:26.420
We are at a friend's.

32:27.023 --> 32:29.123
We're letting a few
of the models stay here.

32:29.825 --> 32:32.159
Seems you got
pretty wasted last night.

32:33.029 --> 32:35.162
I don't remember drinking.

32:35.697 --> 32:37.931
Maybe it was the pills.

32:37.934 --> 32:41.000
People got into the pills.
Did you get into any of that?

32:41.003 --> 32:43.170
What? I don't do drugs.

32:43.805 --> 32:47.073
Ok just lay back down.

32:47.076 --> 32:49.443
We'll talk more about it
when you get some rest.

33:11.566 --> 33:13.866
Nah, I'm at the beach,

33:13.869 --> 33:16.302
but I can pick you up
tonight. Go to a nice dinner.

33:16.305 --> 33:18.271
Go back to your place...

33:18.274 --> 33:20.274
Watch a movie or something...

33:21.476 --> 33:23.477
Can you give me a ride
to little river?

33:24.846 --> 33:26.815
No man, I gotta go,
I got business.

33:27.482 --> 33:29.448
I'll pay $150 dollars.

33:29.451 --> 33:31.117
I got stuff I gotta do...

33:31.120 --> 33:32.721
Listen.

33:34.323 --> 33:35.957
You will take money.

33:36.225 --> 33:38.626
Or I will take your car.

33:43.698 --> 33:45.801
Alright then,
let's do it man, hop in.

33:48.371 --> 33:50.502
Try not to get blood
on my seats.

33:50.505 --> 33:52.306
They're expensive.

34:12.527 --> 34:14.395
Can I use your phone?

34:14.931 --> 34:16.530
Yeah, sure man.

34:25.573 --> 34:27.341
You look so pretty.

34:31.613 --> 34:33.447
I gotta take this.

34:34.317 --> 34:35.684
Hello.

34:39.355 --> 34:41.187
Look, don't call me honey

34:41.190 --> 34:43.289
and don't call me
from weird numbers

34:43.292 --> 34:45.493
and don't call me
when you know that I'm working.

34:48.064 --> 34:49.963
It's the same shit
with her all the time.

34:49.966 --> 34:52.365
She's going to try and test you.

34:52.368 --> 34:54.633
Give her some tough love.
Put her in her place. I'm busy.

34:54.636 --> 34:56.537
Good bye.

35:11.619 --> 35:13.722
You are so cute,
you got a boyfriend?

35:14.457 --> 35:16.323
Hot hot hot.

35:19.594 --> 35:21.127
Yo, it's Lou. What it do?

35:21.130 --> 35:22.964
Hello, it's me.

35:23.199 --> 35:24.800
Privyet.

35:25.001 --> 35:26.199
Privyet.

35:26.202 --> 35:28.267
I need your help.

35:28.270 --> 35:30.337
Sure man, anything for you,
what's going on?

35:30.805 --> 35:32.808
You remember you asked me

35:33.142 --> 35:35.509
if I miss the old days?

35:35.911 --> 35:37.078
Yeah.

35:38.713 --> 35:40.614
I need you to bring the key.

35:41.450 --> 35:43.883
Can you meet me in 30 minutes?

35:43.886 --> 35:46.551
You told me to never give you
the key. I promised.

35:46.554 --> 35:48.854
Plus, don't Max have that shit
from the divorce?

35:48.857 --> 35:51.324
- What's going on bro?
- She's fine, it's fine.

35:51.327 --> 35:52.691
Does Max know about this shit?

35:52.694 --> 35:53.859
Of course she knows.

35:53.862 --> 35:56.229
Wait, yo, what is this?

35:56.232 --> 35:58.264
What we're talking about?
Is everything ok?

35:58.267 --> 36:00.033
Are you safe bro?
What's your location?

36:00.036 --> 36:02.101
- I'll come to you right now.
- I'm fine.

36:02.104 --> 36:05.204
Just meet me
at her place in 30 minutes

36:05.207 --> 36:08.673
and also can you find
out some information

36:08.676 --> 36:10.376
about the place called Hammond?

36:10.379 --> 36:11.713
Ok...

36:12.580 --> 36:14.546
That's pretty fucking weird.

36:14.549 --> 36:17.384
But anyway. Alright, look
I'll pull the police database.

36:18.154 --> 36:20.319
The dark web.
Anything I can find

36:20.322 --> 36:22.789
I'll be there shortly, but yo...
You sure you good man?

36:22.791 --> 36:24.525
Everything's fine.

36:29.065 --> 36:31.632
What kind of illegal shit
are you getting me into man?

36:33.668 --> 36:36.235
Just keep driving.

36:36.238 --> 36:39.105
I'm scared,
I don't know what's happening.

36:39.108 --> 36:42.408
My head hurts, and
why is your arm hurt?

36:42.411 --> 36:44.510
My arm hurts a lot,
I don't know what happened!

36:44.513 --> 36:45.847
Where are my clothes?

36:45.981 --> 36:47.612
I don't know, I have no idea.

36:47.615 --> 36:49.416
I have a head ache...

36:49.518 --> 36:51.184
Who are you?

36:51.187 --> 36:52.584
We are doing the shoot
and you're moving soon.

36:52.587 --> 36:54.087
Put this on.

36:54.090 --> 36:55.720
- No, no.
- Where are my clothes?

36:55.723 --> 36:57.123
Who are you?

36:57.126 --> 36:58.857
Who are you? Where's my phone?

36:58.860 --> 37:00.929
No questions. You hear me?

37:01.363 --> 37:03.899
I don't want to hear
another word out of you.

37:04.599 --> 37:07.468
We have better things,
for this pretty mouth of yours.

37:07.635 --> 37:10.836
So sit quiet, shut up and wait

37:10.839 --> 37:12.807
until we come and get you.

37:40.768 --> 37:42.634
What the fuck happened to you?

37:42.637 --> 37:44.870
And why you have
no fucking shoes on?

37:44.873 --> 37:47.406
Long day, huh? Jesus Christ.

37:47.409 --> 37:49.609
Does this guy have
a restraining order against you?

37:49.612 --> 37:50.742
Or something?

37:50.745 --> 37:51.843
Listen I will talk.

37:51.846 --> 37:53.148
That's the problem.

37:53.715 --> 37:55.183
I handle it.

37:55.817 --> 37:57.719
Don't walk away
when I'm talking to you.

37:59.155 --> 38:01.189
You sure you wanna
do this shit right now?

38:04.360 --> 38:05.925
This is not going to go good...

38:06.896 --> 38:08.462
Coming!

38:08.763 --> 38:10.464
Easy on my door.

38:10.765 --> 38:12.265
What in the flying fuck?

38:12.268 --> 38:13.902
Jesus, Yuri!

38:14.669 --> 38:16.668
You know you can't be here.

38:16.671 --> 38:18.737
Why are you dressed
like a dreidel, anyway, dude?

38:18.740 --> 38:21.040
Work party, my boss is Jewish.

38:21.043 --> 38:22.841
Wait, what the fuck?

38:22.844 --> 38:24.977
Look man,
we don't want any trouble here.

38:24.980 --> 38:26.711
He has no shoes on...

38:26.714 --> 38:28.548
- Don't put it that way.
- What way?

38:28.551 --> 38:30.116
We don't want any trouble.

38:30.119 --> 38:31.417
- Sounds like you want trouble.
- Ok, fine!

38:31.420 --> 38:32.684
Guys!

38:32.687 --> 38:35.555
Brett, I need my toolbox.

38:35.558 --> 38:36.925
And you should listen.

38:37.626 --> 38:40.059
Oh, why don't you guys just go

38:40.062 --> 38:41.860
pump yourselves on the beach.

38:41.863 --> 38:43.765
Toolbox!

38:44.099 --> 38:45.697
I don't have time
for this bullshit.

38:45.700 --> 38:46.868
You should listen.

38:47.735 --> 38:49.170
Oh, we're going to do this?

38:50.539 --> 38:51.703
Told you, thank you.

38:51.706 --> 38:53.673
Ok, cool, real cool.

38:53.676 --> 38:56.609
Hey, Havana, you sure you
want to get wrapped up in this?

38:56.612 --> 38:59.111
I'm calling the cops! I got a
restraining order on your buddy.

38:59.114 --> 39:02.048
You know that, right?
I'm serious.

39:02.051 --> 39:04.450
You don't live here anymore.
I am the man of the house.

39:04.453 --> 39:05.954
Shut the fuck up, please.

39:07.456 --> 39:09.455
Don't make me
take the dreidel off!

39:09.458 --> 39:10.890
What's the big fucking deal
with the shed.

39:10.893 --> 39:12.058
Jesus Christ.

39:12.061 --> 39:14.195
Does he ever listen?

39:16.031 --> 39:17.899
Easy with that stuff.

39:19.702 --> 39:21.100
What's the big deal?

39:21.103 --> 39:22.771
Hello?
You're not gonna say nothing.

39:24.907 --> 39:27.106
Holy shit!

39:27.109 --> 39:28.810
What are you going to...

39:29.744 --> 39:32.579
No, please. No, don't. I
don't want it! You can have it!

39:40.055 --> 39:43.723
Alright, so the
Hammond, right? It's a...

39:43.726 --> 39:47.360
Half night club, half cassino,
but they're on Indian land

39:47.363 --> 39:49.929
and they do whatever they want.
Run by a guy named Thomas camp.

39:49.932 --> 39:51.397
I met him.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.499
Here's the thing:
He's only a front.

39:53.502 --> 39:55.434
He comes up squeaky clean,
but when you look deeper,

39:55.437 --> 39:57.536
it goes a lot further.

39:57.539 --> 40:00.075
It's run by a bunch of guys
that have ties to criminal ties.

40:00.609 --> 40:04.843
I'm talking about like
human trafficking, arms dealing.

40:04.846 --> 40:07.146
They took Julia.

40:07.149 --> 40:09.715
If you stay out of the gym,
and start watching the news.

40:09.718 --> 40:11.550
Yeah! They probably did
take Julia.

40:11.553 --> 40:14.255
Shit happens like this in the
news all the time! I don't know.

40:18.294 --> 40:20.960
Look, you've been in that place
right? So, what do you think?

40:20.963 --> 40:22.595
A place where maybe
she might be?

40:22.598 --> 40:24.299
I think she is inside.

40:24.733 --> 40:27.566
You've been in there, right?
What if you had to pick a spot?

40:27.569 --> 40:29.702
Where do you think she might be?

40:29.705 --> 40:33.172
There was a side room
in the back of the club.

40:33.175 --> 40:35.875
Some kind of key log.

40:35.878 --> 40:38.944
Ok, the club was shut
down when they built a new one

40:38.947 --> 40:41.914
next door, maybe there's a way
to get from one side to the next

40:41.917 --> 40:44.283
my best guess,
it would be the same way

40:44.286 --> 40:46.419
try to go from one side
to the other.

40:46.422 --> 40:48.621
But listen, check this shit out:

40:48.624 --> 40:53.426
Three years ago, right, a guy
with a manifesto claim, right?

40:53.429 --> 40:56.529
He posted a manifesto claim.
Are you paying a-fucking-tention.

40:56.532 --> 40:58.464
He posted a manifesto claim,
claiming that his daughter got

40:58.467 --> 41:00.066
kidnapped in New York.

41:00.069 --> 41:02.234
Wanna hear
the funny part about it?

41:02.237 --> 41:03.636
It was financed
by the same group

41:03.639 --> 41:05.073
of fucking guys.

41:05.574 --> 41:07.473
He filed a fucking petition

41:07.476 --> 41:09.775
and fucking,
guess what happened after that?

41:09.778 --> 41:11.544
And?

41:11.547 --> 41:14.313
Yeah - and. They found him shot
and killed the next day

41:14.316 --> 41:16.315
he filed the petition
with the city.

41:16.318 --> 41:18.684
You know the police said?
It was a home burglary.

41:18.687 --> 41:21.089
Bullshit. Two in the chest
and one in the dome?

41:22.124 --> 41:23.989
Professionals.

41:23.992 --> 41:26.025
Yeah, professionals, I'd know it
you'd know it, but why

41:26.028 --> 41:27.326
didn't the police figure it out?

41:27.329 --> 41:29.929
But it goes a lot deeper.

41:29.932 --> 41:31.597
These guys are powerful.
Are you listening to me?

41:31.600 --> 41:32.899
They're powerful.

41:32.901 --> 41:34.969
And? So what?

41:35.804 --> 41:37.205
What are you doing, didn't I?

41:38.340 --> 41:40.341
Dude, nothing is reading
lay fucking low with you.

41:40.576 --> 41:42.508
I am lay low.

41:42.511 --> 41:45.478
I am lay low! You got blood
everywhere, your shoes are off.

41:45.481 --> 41:46.712
The guns, you're tall
and built like a tank

41:46.715 --> 41:48.082
I'll do it my way.

41:50.753 --> 41:52.518
I have tactical jacket.

41:52.521 --> 41:54.754
Oh, a tactical fucking jacket.
This is great.

41:54.757 --> 41:56.122
Are we going to a damn gala?

41:56.125 --> 41:57.556
A tactical jacket.

41:57.559 --> 41:58.826
Ok, Rambo.

42:00.362 --> 42:03.031
Fuck, he's still asleep,
Jesus Christ.

42:03.832 --> 42:05.767
Do me a favor.

42:06.635 --> 42:08.901
No, no, no.

42:08.904 --> 42:10.436
I just got the car back!

42:10.439 --> 42:11.737
Yes!

42:11.740 --> 42:12.838
Come on, there's no way!

42:12.841 --> 42:13.906
No, please!

42:13.909 --> 42:15.207
Can we talk about this?

42:15.210 --> 42:16.776
Can we talk about this?

42:16.779 --> 42:18.413
I just got the car back, though.

42:18.947 --> 42:20.248
Fuck!

42:20.716 --> 42:22.317
I didn't sign up for this shit.

42:23.318 --> 42:24.485
Fuck.

42:26.088 --> 42:28.120
I don't know why I always
put myself in this situation.

42:28.123 --> 42:30.389
This is crazy!

42:30.392 --> 42:32.794
Are you planning on putting on
some fucking shoes too dude?

42:51.915 --> 42:53.212
Yeah, you're welcome.

42:53.215 --> 42:55.481
Spaciba. Thank you.

42:55.484 --> 42:57.450
Shut the fuck up. Yeah, here.

42:57.453 --> 42:59.354
And I got a burner
phone for you, allright?

42:59.488 --> 43:01.053
Perfect.

43:01.056 --> 43:02.924
Can you give my friend a ride?

43:04.026 --> 43:06.227
Yeah, no problem man,
today I'm like your personal uber.

43:07.262 --> 43:09.097
You scratch it and I'll kill you.

43:09.631 --> 43:11.130
Well, you're just
gonna have to fix it.

43:11.133 --> 43:12.900
I just got the car back.

43:14.102 --> 43:16.302
Ok, so we need four latinas

43:16.305 --> 43:18.237
for the Japan deal, ok?

43:18.240 --> 43:20.141
And a little on the young side.

43:20.175 --> 43:21.507
You think you can swing it?

43:21.510 --> 43:22.708
Of course!

43:22.711 --> 43:24.045
I know you can. Money!

43:34.056 --> 43:35.020
Bobby!

43:35.023 --> 43:35.922
Holly shit!

43:35.925 --> 43:37.156
Yeah.

43:37.159 --> 43:38.524
One guy did all this?

43:38.527 --> 43:40.161
Yeah, tell me about it.

43:41.263 --> 43:43.028
Russian dude, big Ukrainian.

43:43.031 --> 43:44.597
Same difference.

43:44.600 --> 43:45.867
Not really.

43:46.134 --> 43:48.169
So where is he at now?

43:54.109 --> 43:55.376
What's your concern?

43:55.577 --> 43:56.775
Nothing really.

43:56.778 --> 43:58.677
Ok 'cause mine is

43:58.680 --> 44:00.915
getting the club open
in time for tonight, please.

44:00.984 --> 44:02.181
Yeah, you know what camp?

44:02.184 --> 44:03.482
We've got you.

44:03.485 --> 44:05.251
We'll have this open by tonight.

44:05.254 --> 44:06.854
But it's going to cost you.

45:08.383 --> 45:10.651
Do you remember me?

45:32.574 --> 45:33.941
Yes, Brad.

45:33.977 --> 45:36.577
Hey, Yuri was here and...

45:37.112 --> 45:38.912
I tried to stop him.

45:38.915 --> 45:41.580
What do you mean he
was here? What did he say?

45:41.583 --> 45:43.251
First,
he just wanted his toolbox

45:43.685 --> 45:45.520
and then he opened it up
and there's...

45:46.588 --> 45:49.157
Guns, weapons, ammunition...

45:54.496 --> 45:56.063
Hello?

46:00.168 --> 46:01.636
That went well.

46:05.374 --> 46:07.275
Julia!

46:09.778 --> 46:11.446
Julia!

46:12.247 --> 46:14.282
Julia, are you here?

46:19.989 --> 46:21.289
They took her.

46:24.927 --> 46:26.026
Yeah.

46:26.029 --> 46:27.528
They took her.

46:31.901 --> 46:33.100
You saw her?

46:33.869 --> 46:35.369
The girl

46:35.771 --> 46:37.271
Julia.

46:38.273 --> 46:41.108
The girl, with the tatoo.

46:42.111 --> 46:42.909
You know her?

46:42.912 --> 46:44.276
Yes.

46:44.279 --> 46:45.544
Where is she?

46:45.547 --> 46:47.914
I don't know, I fell asleep.

46:47.917 --> 46:48.714
They took her?

46:48.717 --> 46:50.117
Yes.

47:00.829 --> 47:03.163
911 what is your emergency?

47:03.166 --> 47:05.266
I just killed 5 people.

47:05.534 --> 47:07.068
Maybe 6.

47:07.369 --> 47:09.203
At the Hammond, south beach.

47:10.305 --> 47:13.374
There are kidnapped girls
chained up in the basement.

47:14.010 --> 47:17.078
They need medical
attention. Do you understand?

47:22.484 --> 47:26.287
Five of our best men
in Miami, killed.

47:26.688 --> 47:29.655
Two of our assets, taken.

47:29.658 --> 47:32.992
This puts extreme stress
in our enterprise,

47:32.995 --> 47:35.294
not to mention the kind of money

47:35.297 --> 47:37.665
we have to pay the officials
to Bury the investigation.

47:42.205 --> 47:44.572
This is our target.

47:45.874 --> 47:47.375
I know this man.

47:47.876 --> 47:49.377
What do you know?

47:49.611 --> 47:52.113
His name is Yuri gradenko.

47:52.380 --> 47:54.546
He was sambo champion, Ukraine

47:54.549 --> 47:56.815
and he fought in the war.

47:56.818 --> 47:59.986
Special forces,
over 300 confirmed kills.

47:59.989 --> 48:02.824
People talked about him
like he was some kind of legend.

48:03.692 --> 48:06.291
After, I heard
he was a personal bodyguard

48:06.294 --> 48:07.760
for the secretary of defense

48:07.763 --> 48:10.832
and the top crime boss in Moscow.

48:11.968 --> 48:14.234
I thought the secretary defense
was the top crime boss in Moscow.

48:14.237 --> 48:15.636
Chen!

48:18.306 --> 48:19.574
What's he want?

48:20.375 --> 48:22.610
We took something
of value from him.

48:25.580 --> 48:28.349
Her name is Julia, his daughter.

48:28.784 --> 48:30.752
His daughter?

48:31.154 --> 48:32.952
Yes, why?

48:32.955 --> 48:35.122
We're going to need
a lot of bullets.

49:01.416 --> 49:03.551
Bro, what the fuck
happened to laying low?

49:03.585 --> 49:06.418
What do you mean?

49:06.421 --> 49:09.222
The fucking story is out!
It's all over the damn news.

49:09.225 --> 49:12.025
Some guy walks in to the Hammond
and shoots all these gangsters!

49:12.028 --> 49:13.193
Great news.

49:13.196 --> 49:14.393
Sure it is.

49:14.396 --> 49:16.162
Did you tape it?

49:16.165 --> 49:17.766
Of course I fucking taped it.

49:19.302 --> 49:20.902
Very cool.

49:23.705 --> 49:25.437
Look, I've been
doing work on these guys

49:25.440 --> 49:27.539
I've been doing research

49:27.542 --> 49:29.741
and the fucking shit I found.

49:29.744 --> 49:31.844
This goes a little higher
than we both think.

49:31.847 --> 49:34.214
I mean,
I'm close to finding a name

49:34.217 --> 49:36.983
but the clients these guys deal
with from senators to governors

49:36.986 --> 49:39.052
20 years
and no fucking prosecution.

49:39.055 --> 49:40.853
We're going to need
more muscle, bro.

49:40.856 --> 49:42.390
I don't need extra help...

49:42.457 --> 49:44.457
I just need...

49:44.459 --> 49:46.059
Where to find her.

49:46.062 --> 49:48.827
Find her?
Great fucking answer, tough guy.

49:48.830 --> 49:51.965
Easier said than done.
So, the work I found out,

49:51.968 --> 49:53.933
it's the bc holdings group,
right?

49:53.936 --> 49:56.135
They own almost all
the fucking property here.

49:56.138 --> 49:58.304
There's 30 different
places she can be at.

49:58.307 --> 50:01.874
So the research that I found
is probably port lot 29,

50:01.877 --> 50:04.077
so they own this
whole fucking lot, right?

50:04.080 --> 50:06.246
And there's a shipment
coming in tommorrow.

50:06.249 --> 50:08.248
I'm almost certain
from the research I've done

50:08.251 --> 50:10.083
that it should probably be there

50:10.086 --> 50:12.253
Yuri!

50:16.691 --> 50:18.359
Why didn't you tell me?

50:19.328 --> 50:21.328
I tried to tell you.

50:22.164 --> 50:23.832
You were too busy to care.

50:24.200 --> 50:26.299
So you're saying I don't care.

50:26.302 --> 50:28.837
I tried to call you and text you.

50:31.873 --> 50:35.576
Yuri, where the fuck is she?

50:37.213 --> 50:38.847
I don't know.

50:41.083 --> 50:42.616
I just know.

50:43.185 --> 50:44.652
Where we can start.

50:51.360 --> 50:53.594
How's Brett?

50:56.665 --> 50:58.264
It's kind of embarrassing.

50:58.267 --> 50:59.968
You really could have hurt him.

51:01.203 --> 51:03.604
Sorry, it was too much.

51:04.407 --> 51:07.008
I forget he is a small guy...
But-

51:07.509 --> 51:09.477
he has potential...

51:09.778 --> 51:12.981
If he drinks more milk.

51:13.748 --> 51:15.315
That's not funny, Yuri.

51:15.318 --> 51:17.384
He's a good man.

51:20.822 --> 51:22.623
What did you do to yourself?

51:24.659 --> 51:27.294
Mister gradenko!

51:27.363 --> 51:29.062
Mister gradenko!

51:29.065 --> 51:30.498
Come out.

51:33.302 --> 51:36.738
I'm waiting for you Mr. Gradenko.

51:41.177 --> 51:43.209
Tell me something.

51:43.212 --> 51:45.046
Why do you use protection?

51:45.513 --> 51:47.849
Excuse me, sir. Protection?

51:49.352 --> 51:52.418
Well, I guess when
when with a woman, I sometimes-

51:52.421 --> 51:55.388
no, not that type of protection.

51:55.391 --> 51:56.956
I'm talking about
real protection.

51:56.959 --> 51:59.627
Men, guns, a place like this.

52:00.062 --> 52:01.696
Why don't you
use it for yourself?

52:01.763 --> 52:03.229
Because I never needed it.

52:03.232 --> 52:04.733
That's right.

52:05.267 --> 52:07.066
Because the only people
who want to kill you

52:07.069 --> 52:08.435
want to kill me.

52:09.338 --> 52:12.205
You don't need protection
because you are the protection.

52:12.208 --> 52:14.475
I'm not sure I follow.

52:16.479 --> 52:18.512
I'm trying
to make you comprehend

52:18.613 --> 52:20.682
the importance of what you do.

52:21.884 --> 52:23.952
If I would be killed,
who's to blame?

52:24.552 --> 52:26.285
Well... me.

52:26.288 --> 52:28.587
Yes

52:28.590 --> 52:30.456
but I also want you
to comprehend

52:30.459 --> 52:32.626
the importance of who you are.

52:32.794 --> 52:34.160
If I will get killed,

52:34.163 --> 52:35.797
what would you do?

52:37.266 --> 52:38.967
I would feel horrible, sir.

52:40.002 --> 52:42.201
I didn't ask you
how you would feel,

52:42.204 --> 52:44.371
I said, what do you do?

52:45.840 --> 52:48.609
I just don't want
to imagine that.

52:54.183 --> 52:56.718
But you have imagined it,
haven't you?

52:57.053 --> 52:58.920
You take over.

52:59.989 --> 53:02.356
Who else
is going to head this empire?

53:02.491 --> 53:05.459
All of this: Yours.

53:06.529 --> 53:09.396
But that's ok, it's ok.

53:09.798 --> 53:12.067
I just want you
to be honest with me.

53:18.307 --> 53:20.108
You have imagined it,
haven't you?

53:20.742 --> 53:23.477
Yes, I have imagined it.

53:26.581 --> 53:29.681
In time my friend, in time.

53:29.684 --> 53:32.687
But for now, you protect me.

53:43.798 --> 53:46.134
Looks like you made
a lot of enemies lately.

53:46.601 --> 53:48.435
Special forces.

53:50.539 --> 53:52.305
Tell me:

53:52.308 --> 53:54.743
How do you get out
from situation like this?

53:57.446 --> 53:59.546
Rule number 1

54:00.382 --> 54:02.684
always bring back up.

54:03.252 --> 54:04.786
Back up?

55:21.796 --> 55:23.932
Fuck you gradenko.

55:24.667 --> 55:26.768
You're dead.

55:33.108 --> 55:36.077
Oh god, my neck hurts.

55:43.652 --> 55:46.721
Sleeping in car is not easy.

56:04.139 --> 56:07.175
Are you sure?
You trust your friend?

56:08.477 --> 56:10.845
Yes, we work together.

56:11.746 --> 56:13.879
If there's anyone good left
at that police department.

56:13.882 --> 56:15.616
Trust me, it's him.

56:19.854 --> 56:22.057
Let's get out of here.

56:31.133 --> 56:34.002
Yawn!

56:35.271 --> 56:37.872
Maybe we should pick up
some mouthwash along the way.

57:09.071 --> 57:11.270
Mr. Tanaka, nice meeting you.

57:11.273 --> 57:13.975
Very happy to see you here.

57:14.476 --> 57:16.311
I'm about
to make you even happier.

57:17.413 --> 57:21.049
Perfect, let's go
inside and enjoy the show.

57:37.700 --> 57:39.999
Pure beauty latinas.

57:40.002 --> 57:42.103
Where else you can find it?
But Miami.

57:43.072 --> 57:45.006
My clientele
is going to be very happy.

57:45.107 --> 57:47.006
This is a big trend right now.

57:47.009 --> 57:48.977
That's why you come to me.

57:49.411 --> 57:52.213
Because I always
deliver the best.

58:02.524 --> 58:04.092
Hey Max.

58:07.229 --> 58:10.098
I couldn't believe it when
you told me what happened.

58:10.966 --> 58:12.300
How you holding up?

58:13.736 --> 58:17.303
We're allright,
we just need to find her.

58:17.306 --> 58:19.572
Were you able to find anything
with the info we gave you?

58:19.575 --> 58:20.942
I'm off duty this week,

58:21.076 --> 58:22.911
but I did pop in the department

58:23.078 --> 58:24.679
last night after we talked.

58:24.980 --> 58:26.447
What did you find?

58:30.085 --> 58:32.287
Max, I checked into the port.

58:32.788 --> 58:34.322
It's pretty heavy stuff.

58:34.390 --> 58:36.922
If you go after these people,

58:36.925 --> 58:39.761
they're going to come gunning
for you. And I mean gunning.

58:40.929 --> 58:42.463
Are you sure you're ready?

58:42.765 --> 58:45.133
Yeah, I'm sure.

58:58.213 --> 59:00.846
Shit, what the fuck!

59:00.849 --> 59:03.783
So sorry, I had no idea he would
be in on something like this

59:03.786 --> 59:05.050
I had no fucking clue.

59:05.053 --> 59:06.487
I can't believe this.

59:21.136 --> 59:23.137
You friend.

59:23.872 --> 59:26.140
We got a deal.

1:00:31.006 --> 1:00:32.940
You can't kill me. I'm a cop.

1:00:33.075 --> 1:00:34.542
Dirty cop.

1:00:59.434 --> 1:01:00.902
Sir.

1:01:01.203 --> 1:01:03.736
Let me guess. Both of them dead.

1:01:03.739 --> 1:01:05.239
Yes, sir.

1:01:07.075 --> 1:01:09.510
That Russian mother fucker
is costing me a lot of money.

1:01:11.179 --> 1:01:13.414
Well... what if?

1:01:13.815 --> 1:01:15.616
What if we release the girl?

1:01:15.751 --> 1:01:17.585
Give him back the girl!?

1:01:21.123 --> 1:01:22.590
You know who I am?

1:01:23.058 --> 1:01:24.525
You know what I built?

1:01:25.260 --> 1:01:27.693
You think a guy will
take a bunch of our men,

1:01:27.696 --> 1:01:29.397
and I'm going to
become his bitch?

1:01:30.165 --> 1:01:32.233
What the fuck
I'm paying you for?

1:01:32.501 --> 1:01:34.168
Find him.

1:01:34.736 --> 1:01:36.404
And kill him.

1:02:01.030 --> 1:02:02.929
Nice to see you again...

1:02:02.932 --> 1:02:05.133
I see you got great merchandise.

1:02:06.002 --> 1:02:08.133
Oh yes, yes, yes.

1:02:08.136 --> 1:02:10.135
Very nice, very beautiful.

1:02:10.138 --> 1:02:12.204
All of them... ok.

1:02:12.207 --> 1:02:13.941
We're ready.

1:03:02.557 --> 1:03:04.358
When's the chopper coming?

1:03:04.994 --> 1:03:06.561
15 minutes.

1:05:26.903 --> 1:05:29.203
Julia!

1:05:31.339 --> 1:05:33.641
Julia!

1:05:56.865 --> 1:05:59.166
No guns!

1:06:01.103 --> 1:06:03.304
We fight like men!

1:07:00.662 --> 1:07:05.764
Yuri! Help! Yuri, they got me!

1:07:05.767 --> 1:07:12.406
Yuri! Help! Yuri, they got me!

1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:14.776
Yuri!

1:07:45.308 --> 1:07:47.308
Wait! Wait!

1:07:48.510 --> 1:07:50.611
I'm the only one
who knows where she is.

1:07:51.914 --> 1:07:53.782
I'm the only one
who can help you.

1:08:11.267 --> 1:08:13.702
Get that bitch out of here!

1:08:18.007 --> 1:08:20.672
And you,
get me that Russian's daughter.

1:08:20.675 --> 1:08:22.778
You mean the Ukrainian girl?

1:08:23.212 --> 1:08:25.379
Whatever.

1:09:02.952 --> 1:09:05.086
Your father
didn't make this easy.

1:09:06.521 --> 1:09:08.422
I won't forget that.

1:09:08.723 --> 1:09:10.491
Put her over there.

1:09:10.558 --> 1:09:12.660
Sit down!

1:09:13.795 --> 1:09:15.764
My dad's not done yet!

1:09:16.664 --> 1:09:18.900
Oh yes, he's done.

1:09:20.069 --> 1:09:21.635
Find Olivier.

1:09:46.462 --> 1:09:47.963
Yep.

1:09:48.596 --> 1:09:51.264
Oh, hello Mr. Tanaka.

1:09:51.267 --> 1:09:52.633
Yes.

1:09:53.768 --> 1:09:56.437
Oh no,
just a small bump at the port.

1:09:57.440 --> 1:09:59.238
I just wanted to inform you

1:09:59.241 --> 1:10:01.776
that my end of the deal
is almost complete.

1:10:03.245 --> 1:10:06.647
Yes. Thank you.

1:10:21.397 --> 1:10:23.429
Julia is inside.

1:10:23.432 --> 1:10:26.265
Be quiet, lay low.

1:10:26.268 --> 1:10:27.632
But, if they shoot...

1:10:27.635 --> 1:10:30.038
Go loud.

1:10:47.755 --> 1:10:49.422
Hit the button.

1:10:49.425 --> 1:10:51.092
Hit the button!

1:10:52.261 --> 1:10:53.895
Hit the button!

1:10:54.029 --> 1:10:56.164
Taste the rainbow, bitches!

1:11:18.254 --> 1:11:20.822
Where are girls?

1:11:22.491 --> 1:11:23.892
Fuck you!

1:11:25.660 --> 1:11:27.960
Where are girls?

1:11:27.963 --> 1:11:29.764
Fuck you, asshole!

1:11:33.502 --> 1:11:35.870
Allright, fuck this lay low.

1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:46.412
Boss,
we got a problem at the port!

1:11:46.415 --> 1:11:48.016
Now what?

1:11:48.884 --> 1:11:51.417
Dammit, what's going on today?

1:11:51.420 --> 1:11:53.085
What's going on?

1:11:53.088 --> 1:11:55.156
I'm paying people,
they don't do anything.

1:12:43.138 --> 1:12:45.338
Get Olivier on the phone.

1:12:45.341 --> 1:12:47.809
I want to know
what the fuck is going on!

1:12:54.617 --> 1:12:56.582
Oh no.

1:12:56.585 --> 1:12:58.319
He's here.

1:12:58.853 --> 1:13:01.890
Close everything, lock it up.

1:13:08.030 --> 1:13:10.331
Drop the girl!

1:13:11.500 --> 1:13:13.034
Damn, bro!

1:13:30.986 --> 1:13:32.885
I know this car.

1:13:32.888 --> 1:13:34.856
I told you, Julia is here.

1:13:35.090 --> 1:13:36.922
I'm taking the cameras out.

1:13:36.925 --> 1:13:38.893
You go in through the front,
we meet inside.

1:13:43.499 --> 1:13:44.897
How many of us?

1:13:44.900 --> 1:13:47.199
6 maybe 7...

1:13:47.202 --> 1:13:48.369
Guns?

1:13:49.438 --> 1:13:51.840
In the other building...
But boss-

1:13:52.807 --> 1:13:55.174
I got my guys. They're brawlers.

1:13:55.177 --> 1:13:56.811
We're going
to take these motherfuckers.

1:13:57.046 --> 1:13:59.745
That fucking Russian...

1:13:59.748 --> 1:14:02.083
He took out
the crew at the port...

1:14:02.918 --> 1:14:05.484
After camp had killed him!

1:14:05.487 --> 1:14:07.322
And then...

1:14:11.393 --> 1:14:13.027
And then.

1:14:13.662 --> 1:14:16.197
He got Olivier too.

1:14:19.601 --> 1:14:20.902
Don't worry, Charles.

1:14:23.272 --> 1:14:25.938
I mean, boss. We'll get him.

1:14:25.941 --> 1:14:27.640
You better.

1:14:27.643 --> 1:14:29.642
Go find him, or we're all dead.

1:14:29.645 --> 1:14:30.810
I don't see them on the cameras.

1:14:30.813 --> 1:14:32.714
Go. Go!

1:14:38.020 --> 1:14:40.421
At least I have insurance.

1:14:45.127 --> 1:14:47.128
Just like the good old days.

1:14:48.564 --> 1:14:50.696
You really can't tell me
you don't miss this shit,

1:14:50.699 --> 1:14:52.033
not even a little bit.

1:14:55.738 --> 1:14:57.869
I told you: Not one bit,

1:14:57.872 --> 1:14:59.741
not when Julia is involved.

1:15:00.609 --> 1:15:02.508
How about

1:15:02.511 --> 1:15:05.780
666 Toronto,
Toronto is a fucking movie.

1:15:07.049 --> 1:15:08.883
Maybe for you.

1:15:09.518 --> 1:15:11.252
I was sore for weeks.

1:15:14.690 --> 1:15:16.357
I am at the garage door.

1:15:16.625 --> 1:15:18.226
Allright, perfect timing because.

1:15:19.395 --> 1:15:21.429
This guy
is about to be powned, bitch.

1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:26.434
Shit...

1:15:28.303 --> 1:15:30.838
This fucking Russian!

1:15:36.245 --> 1:15:38.177
Alright, check it out.

1:15:38.180 --> 1:15:40.112
The room is empty right now,
just wait by the door.

1:15:40.115 --> 1:15:41.580
I'm opening the door now

1:15:41.583 --> 1:15:42.948
and just wait for me

1:15:42.951 --> 1:15:44.417
I'm coming down now.

1:15:44.420 --> 1:15:46.252
Don't kick nothing down...

1:15:46.255 --> 1:15:48.723
Because you always fuck shit up,
I'm coming down.

1:16:52.254 --> 1:16:55.523
Mr. Tanaka you got to send help.

1:16:56.225 --> 1:16:58.126
I'm a valuable partner.

1:17:01.663 --> 1:17:03.131
I got you.

1:17:03.699 --> 1:17:05.566
Fuck you, Tanaka!

1:17:28.023 --> 1:17:30.558
Get him!

1:18:48.270 --> 1:18:49.937
Oh, this is the elevator?

1:18:51.807 --> 1:18:53.839
It's like a stand up shower.
You can barely fit in.

1:18:53.842 --> 1:18:55.374
You know how many

1:18:55.377 --> 1:18:56.241
bad situations happen
in elevators?

1:18:56.244 --> 1:18:57.978
C'mon man

1:18:57.981 --> 1:19:00.679
I can't do it. I'm scared.
Look, it's from 1927.

1:19:00.682 --> 1:19:02.581
You can do it!

1:19:02.584 --> 1:19:04.519
There's no other way
we can get up there? Crazy!

1:19:05.354 --> 1:19:07.321
What, what?

1:19:09.257 --> 1:19:10.658
No, no, we're not doing this.

1:19:11.060 --> 1:19:13.528
Alright, alright, calm down.

1:19:33.348 --> 1:19:36.017
Come on bitch. Come on.

1:19:37.753 --> 1:19:41.021
Come on bitch,
come on, hurry up, come on.

1:19:41.690 --> 1:19:43.023
Oh shit.

1:19:43.026 --> 1:19:44.959
Bro, I got shot.

1:19:45.694 --> 1:19:47.226
Damn!

1:19:47.229 --> 1:19:48.394
I'm gonna die!

1:19:48.397 --> 1:19:50.164
You're shot, man.

1:19:50.866 --> 1:19:53.401
It hurts so bad bro,
it's burning!

1:19:54.369 --> 1:19:57.037
I told you everything that happens
in elevators is bad luck bro.

1:19:57.040 --> 1:19:58.337
We have to stop the bleeding.

1:19:58.340 --> 1:19:59.405
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

1:19:59.408 --> 1:20:01.240
I got it.

1:20:01.243 --> 1:20:03.442
No. No. No.
It's udonis haslem, bro!

1:20:03.445 --> 1:20:06.146
He's got a
dope ass car collection.

1:20:06.149 --> 1:20:07.279
No the other one. I like him.

1:20:07.282 --> 1:20:09.214
How about number 3?

1:20:09.217 --> 1:20:11.483
Not Dwayne wayde, bro! That's-
flash! Wayde county!

1:20:11.486 --> 1:20:13.252
He's my favorite player.

1:20:13.255 --> 1:20:15.189
The other one!
No, not king LeBron!

1:20:15.290 --> 1:20:16.522
How about this one?

1:20:16.525 --> 1:20:19.224
Yeah, #15 Mario chalmers.

1:20:19.227 --> 1:20:21.061
Nobody likes this game anyway.

1:20:21.064 --> 1:20:23.631
Turn over king!

1:20:24.299 --> 1:20:27.268
Oh my god,
is this supposed to burn?

1:20:28.104 --> 1:20:29.401
I told you, I got it.

1:20:29.404 --> 1:20:30.636
Easy, tiger!

1:20:30.639 --> 1:20:32.105
Keep it.

1:20:47.689 --> 1:20:49.423
Quiet!

1:20:50.859 --> 1:20:52.660
Privyet, gradenko.

1:20:52.995 --> 1:20:54.495
Let her go.

1:20:54.730 --> 1:20:58.366
What? No hello?
No nice to meet you?

1:20:59.102 --> 1:21:00.736
I guess not.

1:21:05.340 --> 1:21:07.074
You're a businessman.

1:21:07.609 --> 1:21:11.546
Let's negotiate,
I have tons of money, rubles...

1:21:12.547 --> 1:21:15.182
No agreement, I'm in ukranian.

1:21:15.517 --> 1:21:18.252
What? You're not Russian?

1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:20.319
How much money?

1:21:20.322 --> 1:21:22.056
Are we talking about?

1:21:23.592 --> 1:21:25.225
I knew you were
a reasonable man.

1:21:25.228 --> 1:21:26.527
Put the gun down.

1:21:30.398 --> 1:21:32.899
How about two million dollars?

1:21:32.902 --> 1:21:35.436
Two million dollars?
Julia what do you think?

1:21:36.371 --> 1:21:38.205
Everybody has a price.

1:21:40.109 --> 1:21:41.174
Papa!

1:21:41.177 --> 1:21:42.711
Julia!

1:21:49.317 --> 1:21:52.553
Nazdarovya.

1:21:53.455 --> 1:21:55.256
Merry Christmas papa.

1:22:03.565 --> 1:22:05.834
Well,
that will keep you occupied.

1:22:11.941 --> 1:22:13.608
Damn.

1:22:29.591 --> 1:22:31.459
So... whatever happened to Max?

1:22:31.593 --> 1:22:33.795
Well...
