00:08.842 --> 00:11.177
[Christine Brennan]
Figure skating is unique.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.265
It is sport, but it is also art.

00:16.808 --> 00:19.519
The music and the gliding on the ice,

00:19.602 --> 00:22.230
that takes you
to a completely different place.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.983
[airy music playing]

00:25.066 --> 00:27.652
But as long as 
I've covered figure skating,

00:27.736 --> 00:29.446
I have never seen anything

00:29.529 --> 00:31.740
like what I saw in Salt Lake City.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.662
[announcer]
The 2002 Olympic Winter Games.

00:40.415 --> 00:43.209
Representing Canada
was a dream come true for me.

00:43.293 --> 00:47.797
[announcer] Let's welcome
Jamie Salé and David Pelletier.

00:48.923 --> 00:52.177
We're at the Olympics for the first time,
playing with the big guys.

00:52.260 --> 00:56.556
[announcer] And from Russia,
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze.

00:58.016 --> 01:02.103
The Olympics is not only
competition between skaters,

01:02.187 --> 01:04.773
but this is competition between countries.

01:04.856 --> 01:08.443
[Christine] This really was a battle
of North America against Russia.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.155
Frankly, it was the Cold War on ice.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.164
[crowd cheering]

01:26.628 --> 01:28.546
[announcer] Oh! How did that happen?

01:28.630 --> 01:29.464
No!

01:30.298 --> 01:32.550
The Russians hadn't lost a gold medal

01:32.634 --> 01:35.637
in that event in 40 years
and they weren't about to start now.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.891
[reporter] The pairs skating
becomes the unlikely site of controversy.

01:41.267 --> 01:45.396
The judge ran over to me
and said, "You've got to help me."

01:45.480 --> 01:46.898
"I had to do it."

01:48.233 --> 01:50.068
That's when the shit got real.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.948
If she was pressured,
was she also influenced?

01:55.031 --> 01:55.865
What?

01:55.949 --> 01:59.744
Have you received
any proof of impropriety?

01:59.828 --> 02:04.165
…that the long arm of organized crime
has reached across the globe.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.629
This is one of the biggest scandals
in Olympic history.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.342
[theme music playing]

03:00.054 --> 03:03.641
[Jamie] I grew up in a small town
in the middle of Alberta in Canada.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.646
My parents divorced
when I was a young child.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.691
My mom raised me as a single mom.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.485
We didn't have a lot of money.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.113
A lot of the kids
would make fun of me because of that.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.531
It was hard.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.367
And I always felt like an outsider.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.954
So my outlet, my…

03:25.580 --> 03:27.081
My escape was skating.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.335
[announcer] Jamie Salé.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.836
[crowd cheering and applauding]

03:31.920 --> 03:34.380
[Jamie] It's… exhilarating.

03:34.464 --> 03:38.760
Like just the feeling of flying like that,
lifting up in the air.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.429
[Patti Salé] Like most Canadian kids,

03:41.512 --> 03:43.806
Jamie was born on ice, raised on ice.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.227
There were ice rinks
in every neighborhood.

03:47.810 --> 03:51.105
But from a young age,
she definitely stood out.

03:51.814 --> 03:55.276
[Jamie] In 1988,
the Olympic Games came to Canada.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.445
It was just extremely magical for me.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.365
There was so much excitement and energy

04:00.448 --> 04:02.742
and I knew the world was watching.

04:02.825 --> 04:05.161
[announcer] Oh, she did it!

04:05.245 --> 04:08.206
I just remember thinking,
"Oh, my gosh, I wanna feel that."

04:09.332 --> 04:12.627
[Patti] She would say to me,
"When I go to the Olympics."

04:12.710 --> 04:15.171
It was never, "If." It was always, "When."

04:16.756 --> 04:19.550
[announcer] Jamie Salé and Jason Turner
see themselves

04:19.634 --> 04:23.304
as the team of the future
in Canadian and world figure skating.

04:24.305 --> 04:28.351
[Jamie] If you're a strong single skater,
you're selected to be a pair skater.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.812
-Just do a two-hander.
-Just two hands.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.691
And then it's down to chemistry.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.028
My partner and I got to Nationals.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.031
And then we qualified
for the World Championships.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.284
I want my mom!

04:45.368 --> 04:47.453
I was 16 years old, just a baby.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.999
And I'm-- I'm going to represent Canada.

04:51.582 --> 04:54.961
[hopeful music playing]

04:55.044 --> 04:58.006
[announcer] Let's look to Canada's
Jamie Salé and Jason Turner

04:58.089 --> 05:00.216
at their first World Championships.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.594
[announcer 2] Here are the double axels.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.472
And Jason touched down with his hand.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.314
[Jamie] We ended up
not having a great skate there.

05:15.940 --> 05:19.402
[Patti] She and her partner Jason
finished sixteenth.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.989
She comes home and said to me,
"Mom, I'm breaking up with Jason

05:23.072 --> 05:27.160
because I don't think that I can be
a world champion with him."

05:29.454 --> 05:32.874
[Jamie] So then I was on the hunt
for a new partner,

05:32.957 --> 05:34.959
someone that could take me
to the next level,

05:35.043 --> 05:37.587
which was to win gold
at the Olympics.

05:38.212 --> 05:42.175
That was hard because…
the Russians were really good.

05:42.967 --> 05:43.801
Really good.

05:48.014 --> 05:52.977
[Christine] There are very few dynasties
in sport like Russian pair skating.

05:55.271 --> 05:58.316
It's that beautiful,
lyrical quality of the Bolshoi Ballet

05:59.067 --> 06:00.610
embodied on the ice.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.237
And they're unbeatable.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.706
[tense music playing]

06:20.755 --> 06:23.966
[speaking Russian]
To skate for Russia at the Olympics,

06:24.050 --> 06:27.011
just the idea of getting there

06:27.595 --> 06:30.473
was beyond my wildest dreams.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.185
I was born in the city of Nevinnomyssk.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.063
There is not much there.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.275
My father liked his drink.

06:42.485 --> 06:46.447
He drank a lot, 
and that's why my parents separated.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.664
My mother found

06:55.832 --> 07:01.629
skates that were three sizes too big,

07:02.797 --> 07:06.717
because there were
no smaller ones in the Soviet Union.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.723
I was six years old,

07:12.807 --> 07:16.269
coaches came to our town.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.403
I was singled out

07:25.486 --> 07:28.906
as the best one in the group,

07:30.783 --> 07:32.326
so I was sent to Moscow.

07:35.872 --> 07:39.584
It was a 36-hour train ride away.

07:41.878 --> 07:45.339
Of course it was hard
for my mother to let me go.

07:53.431 --> 07:58.644
[Tamara Moskvina] Talented young skaters
were brought to the central school

07:58.769 --> 08:00.605
in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

08:02.815 --> 08:06.068
And they were taught by coach like me.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.786
Tamara Moskvina is a genius.
She's a mastermind.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.998
She is one of the great coaches
in the history of sports.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.043
Over the years, she has produced

08:22.126 --> 08:24.378
Olympic gold medalist
after Olympic gold medalist.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.926
[Tamara] We take normal people

08:30.009 --> 08:32.970
and make stars out of them.

08:34.722 --> 08:39.185
But the Olympics
is not only competition between skaters,

08:39.268 --> 08:41.729
but this is competition between countries.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.775
[Christine] The Communist system,
uh, decided early on

08:45.858 --> 08:49.987
that Olympic gold medals would be
part of the story of their success.

08:51.405 --> 08:54.992
It's really intertwined
with the fact of beating North America.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.787
And they were gonna dominate,

08:57.870 --> 08:58.955
whatever it takes.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.040
[crowd cheering]

09:03.543 --> 09:06.212
[Tamara] When Elena came to Moscow,

09:06.295 --> 09:08.422
she was very shy.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.841
Didn't talk much.

09:11.842 --> 09:15.513
But she was, uh,
technically very talented.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.265
Very talented.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.934
[reporter]
Elena Berezhnaya is 18 years old

09:20.017 --> 09:22.937
and wants to meet
Arnold Schwarzenegger someday.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.690
Her partner, Oleg Shliakhov, is 22.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.444
[Elena] I was small and skinny,

09:31.237 --> 09:35.366
so the coaches thought
I would work well in pairs skating.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.745
I was assigned a partner.

09:42.748 --> 09:47.086
Oleg was a very tempermental guy.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.422
[announcer] The throw triple loop.

09:50.298 --> 09:54.719
She has beautiful, tight legs in the air,
but is simply unable to hold the landing

09:54.802 --> 09:56.262
and this is a particularly bad…

09:56.345 --> 09:58.514
[Elena] He expected perfection,

09:59.181 --> 10:03.144
and his negative outbursts

10:03.728 --> 10:05.479
were directed at me.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.862
[announcer] He wants out of there.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.198
Tamara is saying under her breath,
"You stay right there."

10:16.824 --> 10:20.202
He's been known to be
rather aggressive with his partners.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.165
[Tamara] When there was some mistakes,

10:24.248 --> 10:26.459
he cannot control his anger.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.254
And he could hit her.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.301
[man translating]
"I can only answer in one way."

10:35.384 --> 10:40.890
"What happened between us
was strictly our own business."

10:40.973 --> 10:44.143
[Tamara] His abuses never stopped.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.519
Never stopped.

10:48.939 --> 10:52.735
And then one day there was an accident.

10:57.531 --> 10:58.824
It happened so fast.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.535
We were doing spinning,

11:02.119 --> 11:07.124
doing parallel spins.
We came very close to each other

11:07.208 --> 11:09.835
and his skate hit my head.

11:11.337 --> 11:15.091
Elena Berezhnaya's career
and life were nearly ended.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.052
[reporter 2] The two were practicing when,
in a tragic accident,

11:18.135 --> 11:22.765
Shliakhov's skate pierced Elena's skull,
sending bone fragments into her brain.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.858
[Elena] I couldn't speak.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.820
I didn't know why.

11:35.903 --> 11:39.156
I could understand everything,
but I couldn't respond.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.037
[Tamara] I went to the hospital,

11:45.705 --> 11:48.958
visited Elena, and she was laying in bed,

11:49.041 --> 11:49.875
pale

11:49.959 --> 11:51.001
thin,

11:51.585 --> 11:52.420
motionless.

11:55.464 --> 11:58.134
[Elena] The doctors told me
I needed an operation.

12:00.010 --> 12:03.556
No one knew 
what was going to happen to me,

12:03.639 --> 12:06.016
how it would go, how long it would take.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.604
[interviewer] Was it likely
she might not skate again?

12:10.688 --> 12:11.647
Of course.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.369
[Jamie] I was still
on the hunt for a partner.

12:25.870 --> 12:29.582
I was back to doing singles,
which was not my passion at all.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.380
I didn't really know of any other skaters
that were even available

12:36.464 --> 12:40.593
that were at that level that could compete
with me at the Olympics.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.889
[Patti] I think she was depressed.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.766
And it was painful to watch…

12:49.935 --> 12:52.605
um, because everything was falling apart.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.529
[Jamie] And then someone said,
"What about David Pelletier?"

13:01.155 --> 13:02.364
[audience applauding]

13:02.448 --> 13:05.493
[announcer] In the last couple of years,
David Pelletier has been skating

13:05.576 --> 13:07.787
with Allison Gaylor and Caroline Roy.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.873
[David] Pairs skating
is the same thing as dating.

13:11.373 --> 13:14.460
You're together for four years,
and then it doesn't work anymore.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.171
[crowd cheering]

13:18.214 --> 13:19.298
In 1998,

13:19.924 --> 13:21.300
I told my partner at the time,

13:21.383 --> 13:24.804
"You know, I think I want to try out
to skate with other people."

13:29.058 --> 13:31.936
So I need someone
that wants it as bad as me.

13:33.395 --> 13:34.563
And here comes Jamie.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.151
[announcer] But of all the skaters here,
she's probably one of the best.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.611
[Jamie] I reached out to him,

13:40.694 --> 13:43.239
and asked him
if he'd be willing to do a tryout.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.617
I remember being incredibly nervous.

13:48.452 --> 13:51.163
But then I put my hand out,
and he put his hand out

13:51.247 --> 13:53.290
without even looking and they touched.

13:57.044 --> 14:00.339
We did a lift together,
and it was just effortless.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.971
Everything was so easy with him.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.642
[David] There was so much, so much joy

14:12.560 --> 14:13.519
in her skating.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.733
Timing, like anything else in life
is a big deal in sport.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.694
The stars have to align.

14:37.835 --> 14:41.422
[Elena] I spent months in the hospital.

14:42.006 --> 14:45.843
They wanted me to rest,
but I was ready to start training again.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.765
[Tamara] She started slowly 
to recover physically.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.268
So the doctor

14:55.060 --> 14:57.646
allowed her to come to the ice rink.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.360
She decided that she will leave Oleg.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.407
And so I put her with a new partner,

15:09.074 --> 15:11.327
Anton Sikharulidze.

15:12.119 --> 15:16.332
[Anton speaking Russian] I've dedicated 
my life to figure skating,

15:16.415 --> 15:20.002
and all I want is to reach the top.

15:21.962 --> 15:26.091
[Elena] It's rare to find 
such a perfect partnership,

15:26.175 --> 15:30.888
and life is short, so you have to seize
the opportunity while you can.

15:33.432 --> 15:37.061
[Tamara] When you just watch them
doing simple elements,

15:37.144 --> 15:42.650
you were amazed by their quality
and beauty of their movements.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.657
Repeat after me.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.075
The Russians are coming.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.827
The Russians are coming.
The Russians are coming.

15:53.911 --> 15:57.623
[grand, dramatic music playing]

15:59.541 --> 16:03.712
[Christine] If Tamara has a great,
young new pair, you want to watch them.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.507
And at 1998, in the World Championships,

16:06.590 --> 16:09.885
I got a chance to see
Anton and Elena on the ice.

16:10.761 --> 16:15.224
[announcer] From Russia,
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.602
["Dark Eyes" playing]

16:26.485 --> 16:28.028
[crowd cheering]

16:28.612 --> 16:30.280
[announcer 2] Magnificent height.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.703
[David] We watched Anton and Elena.
I remember saying,

16:36.620 --> 16:38.872
"That's our competition
for the next four years."

16:38.956 --> 16:40.958
["Dark Eyes" continues playing]

16:41.041 --> 16:42.876
[crowd cheering]

16:43.836 --> 16:46.296
[announcer 2]
They are sensitive, they're elegant,

16:46.380 --> 16:48.590
they are really a very dramatic pair.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.683
[crowd cheering and applauding]

16:57.766 --> 16:59.435
[Christine] They get the gold medal.

17:00.102 --> 17:04.064
And then they just blew the doors off
of the competition the next few years.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.317
The Russian juggernaut really unstoppable.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.786
[Jamie] Russians are known
to have a lot of ballet training.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.914
We have a very,
very different style of skating.

17:23.250 --> 17:27.504
We have more of like
a sort of a powerhouse kind of style.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.301
And we could be playful and have fun.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.846
[announcer] Wow, they sizzle.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.640
[Jamie] We started
competing internationally

17:38.724 --> 17:40.392
and we started winning.

17:41.435 --> 17:45.856
[announcer] She's 22 years old, he's 25.
They've been together only 18 months.

17:46.356 --> 17:49.985
[David] We're playing with the big guys.
We're part of the conversation.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.739
They've had an amazing year.
They've won everything in sight.

17:56.450 --> 18:01.121
Preparing for the 2002 Olympics,
we of course watched

18:01.205 --> 18:03.457
David and Jamie carefully.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.335
And we were considering

18:06.418 --> 18:09.880
this couple as a strong rivalry.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.385
[Christine] It's becoming the battle
of the West versus the East.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.764
Jamie and David are now
North America's greatest pair.

18:19.431 --> 18:23.185
I mean, they're the All-American kids
except they're the all Canadian kids.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.229
How could you not fall in love with them?

18:26.230 --> 18:28.315
I think a bit of the allure
of Jamie and David

18:28.398 --> 18:30.943
is people wondering,
"Are they a couple, are they not?"

18:31.026 --> 18:33.028
[crowd cheering and applauding]

18:36.949 --> 18:40.536
[Craig Fenech] I remember exactly
what I thought when I saw Jamie and David,

18:41.036 --> 18:43.247
which was, "Wow."

18:44.748 --> 18:46.875
They are an "it" couple.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.295
I knew they had star power about them,
that was clear.

18:50.921 --> 18:54.133
And I thought,
"I could definitely monetize them."

18:57.845 --> 18:59.930
[Jamie] Craig is a big businessman.

19:00.889 --> 19:03.725
He didn't really have
a skating background,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.978
which made us a little bit nervous.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.397
But he had big plans for David and I.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.859
I don't know shit about figure skating.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.904
I mostly made my career representing

19:15.988 --> 19:17.865
professional baseball players.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.704
But I knew the Olympics,
it's a multi-billion-dollar business.

19:24.955 --> 19:29.168
There are sponsorship opportunities
depending on how well you do.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.921
And I decided that…

19:34.631 --> 19:37.634
we would bet our marketing strategy

19:38.302 --> 19:40.012
on winning the gold medal.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.890
[Francis Lai's
"Theme from Love Story" playing]

19:42.973 --> 19:45.809
[Jamie] The Olympics was gonna be held
in Salt Lake City.

19:45.893 --> 19:49.438
And so the piece of music
that we chose to skate to

19:49.521 --> 19:52.149
was from the American movie Love Story.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.027
Hey! What is it, Barrett?

19:56.069 --> 19:56.904
What is this?

19:56.987 --> 19:58.947
I'll tell you
after we cross the threshold.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.825
[Jamie] It's an iconic movie
that everybody knew of.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.826
I need you.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.745
[Christine] This was all part of the plan.

20:04.828 --> 20:05.704
I need you too.

20:05.787 --> 20:08.999
It's not cheating. It's just--
It's just smart figure skating.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.293
To say, "Hey, we're on US ice."

20:11.376 --> 20:14.463
"Let's come back with a program
that Americans know."

20:17.549 --> 20:18.550
It's a very…

20:19.051 --> 20:21.178
fairy tale love story.

20:21.261 --> 20:24.264
The skaters that they're watching
look like they're in love.

20:24.806 --> 20:28.810
And so the fact that David and I were,
made it even better for the audience.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.899
[David] About a year
after we started skating together,

20:33.982 --> 20:35.943
that's when my feelings changed for Jamie.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.487
[Jamie] What transpired over time,

20:38.570 --> 20:41.657
was the connection that we had
was really special.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.700
-[laughing]
-[David] We were in love.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.869
We had fun together.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.455
But on ice, it was business.

20:51.959 --> 20:55.087
[announcer] The 2002 Olympic Winter Games.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.296
[crowd cheering]

20:56.380 --> 21:00.217
[Christine] Now, this is the moment…
that everyone's been waiting for.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.720
[announcer] The United States of America.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.225
[Christine] The Olympics were going to be
a proud moment for the United States.

21:09.434 --> 21:14.022
It occurred a very interesting time.
Just several months after 9/11.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.402
It's the United States hosting the world.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.488
[announcer 2] Canada.

21:21.571 --> 21:25.742
[Jamie] To walk out, representing Canada
in a North American Olympics

21:25.826 --> 21:27.494
was so amazing.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.788
It really did feel like
we were on home soil.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.666
I was like, "This is my Olympics."

21:34.376 --> 21:36.420
[announcer] Russian Federation.

21:36.503 --> 21:40.215
[Elena] We knew who we had to beat.

21:41.383 --> 21:45.387
It was just us and them.

21:46.096 --> 21:49.016
We were singing,
[singing] "We are waiting for battle…"

21:49.099 --> 21:51.560
[laughing] Russians would know it.

21:53.103 --> 21:58.066
[Tamara] President Vladimir Putin
encouraged skaters to skate well.

21:59.026 --> 22:03.488
But nobody's sent to the prison
if they don't win gold.

22:03.572 --> 22:08.118
We don't say, "Oh, you must be first,
otherwise I kill you!"

22:09.703 --> 22:12.247
I think Tamara was supremely confident

22:12.331 --> 22:16.501
that Anton and Elena would win
the Olympic gold medal. I am sure of that.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.842
This is as good as it's gonna get
in terms of a competition between

22:23.925 --> 22:26.636
two of the greatest figure skating nations
in the world.

22:32.142 --> 22:35.228
[announcer] We are just moments away
from the final warm-up.

22:36.063 --> 22:40.067
There are the Canadians,
Jamie Salé, David Pelletier.

22:41.276 --> 22:45.155
And behind them Elena Berezhnaya,
Anton Sikharulidze.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.617
And in a moment,
they will open the gate for six minutes

22:48.700 --> 22:52.746
to try and dispel some
of the Olympic butterflies.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.792
So the warm-up,
you got six minutes to get ready.

22:59.544 --> 23:04.591
You can literally feel the heat coming off
each other's body because of the nerves.

23:06.760 --> 23:12.307
The tension that went into that rink,
at that moment, it was unbelievable.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.686
[Jamie] David and I do a specific lift,

23:17.354 --> 23:18.730
we do one throw,

23:19.356 --> 23:21.858
and we do two jumps side by side.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.277
And at the end,
when there's one minute remaining,

23:24.986 --> 23:28.657
I would always leave on my own
and go do a double toe.

23:30.534 --> 23:34.037
I started to skate around the ice
and I saw the Russians coming

23:34.121 --> 23:38.542
and I assumed they were gonna go
diagonally down the ice and do a lift.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.295
[Patti] Jamie's coming down the ice,

23:42.379 --> 23:44.798
and the Russians are coming
from the other side.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.553
And it's just like a split second,
but it was like…

23:50.470 --> 23:52.305
I wanted to scream, you know, "Look out!"

23:59.020 --> 24:01.356
The whole arena went silent.

24:01.440 --> 24:05.110
Like, I couldn't hear anything
and I was just… stunned.

24:05.193 --> 24:08.405
[announcer]
It is Anton Sikharulidze and Jamie Salé.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.949
This is unbelievable.

24:11.032 --> 24:13.160
[Jamie]
I couldn't really breathe very well.

24:13.702 --> 24:18.290
And I also didn't know how injured
I really was because I was in such shock.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.296
[Patti] I'm like, 
"She's gonna be injured, for sure."

24:24.379 --> 24:25.839
"For sure she's gonna be injured."

24:30.927 --> 24:34.890
I remember thinking,
"Uh-oh. This is the last thing we needed."

24:34.973 --> 24:37.851
And I-- I'll be honest with you,
I wasn't sure it wasn't deliberate.

24:37.934 --> 24:38.768
I mean…

24:39.728 --> 24:42.063
I saw the Nancy and Tonya thing, right?

24:44.232 --> 24:49.029
It's unbelievable that they collided,

24:50.113 --> 24:51.907
but the music is starting,

24:52.449 --> 24:54.826
you have to put it behind you and perform.

24:55.410 --> 24:59.956
[announcer]
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.167
It's the moment of truth.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.835
I sit in my place,

25:04.336 --> 25:05.754
and I'm nervous as hell.

25:06.505 --> 25:10.091
Because it's the ultimate event
of all time for everyone.

25:11.134 --> 25:11.968
Here we go.

25:12.469 --> 25:13.345
The Russians.

25:16.264 --> 25:19.351
[Massenet's "Méditation" playing]

25:27.025 --> 25:30.946
[Elena] You have tunnel vision,
and that's it.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.323
At that moment,

25:33.406 --> 25:36.868
I just remembered everything
that Tamara taught me.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.251
[announcer] This couple is exquisite.

25:46.753 --> 25:50.298
[Patti] It is a beautiful program.
And the Russians were magnificent.

25:54.135 --> 25:55.887
[Jamie] David and I were backstage,

25:56.429 --> 25:57.931
but we chose not to look.

25:58.431 --> 26:01.560
We chose to stay focused on… us.

26:01.643 --> 26:05.146
And I remember hearing
the audience react to something.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.653
I immediately thought,
"Okay. They've made a mistake."

26:13.029 --> 26:14.739
[Tamara] It was not a mistake.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.033
It was little details.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.787
That was a mistake, and it was
easily recognizable as a mistake.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.129
They were still very good.

26:29.212 --> 26:32.591
They stayed in the program,
and they skated so well.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.475
[Patti] Their costumes are beautiful.

26:42.559 --> 26:47.564
Their performance was polished
and such high-caliber skating.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.783
[crowd cheering and applauding]

26:59.618 --> 27:00.535
They finish.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.662
And I'm sure they're thinking,

27:02.746 --> 27:05.915
"A little stumble isn't gonna
cost us the Olympic gold medal."

27:06.416 --> 27:09.336
[announcer] There won't be anyone close
so far in the evening.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.005
And now what do the judges say?

27:16.593 --> 27:17.969
[Stapleford] In figure skating,

27:18.053 --> 27:21.931
the top countries
send a judge to the Olympic Games.

27:24.225 --> 27:27.270
But you got to be
completely neutral and unbiased.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.648
You're not there
representing your country.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.983
You're there representing skating.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.405
[Benoit] Judging figure skating
is so subjective.

27:38.615 --> 27:42.035
Everything influences a judge,

27:42.535 --> 27:46.331
the package, the look,
the fit, the costume.

27:46.831 --> 27:51.127
Anything that will catch my attention
will have an influence on the result.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.841
[Sally] There are two marks out of six.

27:57.342 --> 28:01.388
One for technical merit
and the second one for presentation.

28:03.390 --> 28:06.810
[Benoit] Overall, they skated well,
but they do one major mistake

28:06.893 --> 28:09.854
that I knew everybody was gonna see
in the combination jump.

28:10.855 --> 28:14.109
But there are two other mistakes as well,
one, landing in a throw…

28:15.318 --> 28:16.861
and the catch on the twist.

28:16.945 --> 28:21.950
So, for me, it was three major mistakes
that could not be awarded the top marks.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.328
[announcer] The marks for technical merit.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.373
Five-eight, five-eight, five-seven…

28:28.456 --> 28:30.125
[Patti] When the Russians marks came up,

28:30.208 --> 28:33.294
I remember thinking,
"Well, those are fairly high marks."

28:33.378 --> 28:35.463
[announcer] Their marks for presentation.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.550
Mostly five-nines.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.845
[announcer 2] 
The program is the most difficult

28:41.928 --> 28:46.099
because the choreography weaves,
and that was given credit.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.977
[Tamara] For four years we were preparing.

28:49.060 --> 28:52.897
That's why when they showed the results,

28:52.981 --> 28:53.898
I was happy.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.651
They're winning scores,
gold-medal-winning scores.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.945
There's no doubt about it,
and it was a surprise,

28:59.028 --> 29:03.867
because the judges
did not really mark down for a mistake.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.870
[Elena] We were just waiting.

29:06.953 --> 29:10.331
Our fate was being decided in heaven.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.834
Something was being decided somewhere.

29:14.043 --> 29:16.004
Now we just had to wait and see.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.467
[announcer] And skating next,

29:20.550 --> 29:23.845
their pursuers,
Jamie Salé and David Pelletier of Canada.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.806
She crashed with Anton in the warm-up,

29:26.890 --> 29:29.976
but gave us the thumbs up backstage
that she's okay.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.439
[Jamie] It was really important
not to focus on the accident.

29:34.522 --> 29:37.442
And knowing that they had made a mistake,

29:37.525 --> 29:39.319
I just kept telling myself,

29:40.487 --> 29:41.529
"Focus on you."

29:42.030 --> 29:43.698
"I'm going for gold today."

29:48.703 --> 29:52.540
[Francis Lai's "For Me Alone"
from Love Story playing]

29:54.667 --> 29:56.044
[David] They put the music on.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.838
You go into a zone
that's very hard to explain.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.800
The crowds become blurry.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.135
You don't see faces.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.513
[crowd cheering]

30:06.596 --> 30:07.764
The smells are…

30:08.640 --> 30:09.474
stronger.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.935
The music plays louder.

30:23.029 --> 30:26.658
[crowd cheering and applauding]

30:31.746 --> 30:35.208
We went jump, lift, twist, throw.

30:38.044 --> 30:38.878
No problem.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.298
First-and-half minute's done.

30:43.550 --> 30:44.801
And then… [chuckles]

30:44.884 --> 30:47.762
…I think I started to get 
colors in my face again.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.683
[music swells and soars]

30:52.851 --> 30:53.810
I felt like

30:54.352 --> 30:56.062
those parties I didn't go to,

30:56.729 --> 30:58.398
the booze I didn't drink,

30:58.481 --> 30:59.899
the money I didn't have,

31:00.650 --> 31:01.943
it was kind of worth it.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.578
[crowd cheering]

31:11.661 --> 31:13.955
[Benoit]
All the transitions were seamless,

31:14.038 --> 31:16.749
that you felt
that they were skating on velvet.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.551
[Patti] There we go.

31:26.634 --> 31:29.554
There we go with each element.
There we go.

31:34.642 --> 31:37.770
[Craig] There was a truth
that came through their performance.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.856
They were performing
to the song "Love Story"

31:39.939 --> 31:42.233
and they were in love and you felt it.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.492
[David] We went into a last risky element,
the throw.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.787
[announcer] Throw a triple loop
and the gold is theirs.

31:56.581 --> 31:57.498
[crowd cheering]

31:57.582 --> 32:01.044
[Lai's "For Me Alone" soaring]

32:06.716 --> 32:08.718
[Jamie] I said to him, "We did it."

32:08.801 --> 32:11.012
And he said to me, "We're not done yet."

32:11.679 --> 32:13.056
We had three elements to go.

32:13.932 --> 32:19.729
But I knew that these elements
we had left were not difficult for us.

32:20.521 --> 32:22.774
[crowd cheering and applauding]

32:24.984 --> 32:27.111
[Christine] It was terrific.
They nailed it.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.738
They could not have done better.

32:32.533 --> 32:33.993
[David] We finish with a spin.

32:34.577 --> 32:35.411
We're spinning.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.039
I remember, "I don't want this to end."

32:38.957 --> 32:41.668
[crowd roaring]

32:46.631 --> 32:49.217
[Jamie] I looked up in the audience
and I saw people standing,

32:49.300 --> 32:53.179
and I heard people screaming.
There were smiles on everybody's faces.

32:54.430 --> 32:56.557
[announcer]
Well, the crowd has made its choice.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.601
A standing ovation.

33:00.728 --> 33:03.147
[Patti] We knew it was perfect.
They hadn't made a mistake.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.984
We knew it was
an inspired performance, and…

33:06.067 --> 33:08.569
[voice breaks]
…I was just so incredibly proud.

33:12.448 --> 33:15.952
[Elena] It was impossible 
not to hear the roar, the shouting.

33:16.035 --> 33:17.662
The stands were shaking;

33:19.122 --> 33:23.376
the building nearly collapsed.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.505
[Jamie] I think it's what
every athlete dreams of.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.008
Getting to the Olympics.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.553
And-- and being perfect.

33:36.305 --> 33:38.307
[fans cheering]

33:39.017 --> 33:42.395
[Jamie] We skated back to what we call
the kiss-and-cry area,

33:42.478 --> 33:45.773
and we were all so excited,
and we figured we've got this in the bag.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.489
[Benoit] I enter my marks
for Jamie and David.

33:54.449 --> 33:57.618
And I'm convinced,
they were gonna be Olympic champion.

33:58.578 --> 34:02.790
[announcer] The marks for Jamie Salé
and David Pelletier, Canada.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.000
Here are the marks.

34:04.083 --> 34:04.959
[fans cheering]

34:05.043 --> 34:06.335
[Jamie and David chuckling]

34:06.419 --> 34:07.920
[announcer] Prolonging the suspense.

34:08.921 --> 34:09.964
And they go up.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.090
And they're big!

34:11.174 --> 34:14.385
That's a little closer than I thought
it was gonna be, though.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.722
[David] Technical mark came out.

34:18.514 --> 34:20.183
"It's good. That's good. It's cool."

34:20.767 --> 34:23.227
And then the artistic impression marks
came up.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.313
[dramatic music playing]

34:27.648 --> 34:30.735
[announcer 2] A little bit ahead,
but look at this presentation mark.

34:31.277 --> 34:34.072
[announcer 1] The placements, 
look at the placements. Look at this!

34:34.155 --> 34:36.199
-[announcer 3] How did that happen?
-[announcer 2] No!

34:36.282 --> 34:37.325
[announcer 1] They won!

34:42.330 --> 34:44.248
I hear that big sound like…

34:44.332 --> 34:46.042
[imitates angry crowd]

34:46.125 --> 34:48.127
[crowd reacting]

34:48.628 --> 34:52.131
I said, "What? Second?"
I hear they're second. I said, "What?"

34:56.427 --> 34:59.055
[Jamie] At first,
I was just sitting there…

35:00.181 --> 35:01.057
confused.

35:02.391 --> 35:05.228
[David] She kept going, "It's gonna
switch, right? It's gonna switch?"

35:05.311 --> 35:07.772
[chuckling] I had no idea
what she was talking about.

35:07.855 --> 35:10.358
"It's not gonna switch.
It's on the screen. It's on TV."

35:10.441 --> 35:11.984
[announcer] They won that program.

35:12.860 --> 35:17.323
There's not a doubt to anyone in the place
except for maybe a few judges.

35:18.407 --> 35:20.868
[Benoit]
Four judges went with first place.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.996
And five judges went with second place.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.750
It-- it-- it was unbelievable.

35:28.751 --> 35:31.420
The real shock just swept over the arena.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.881
That what you'd just seen on the ice,

35:33.965 --> 35:36.425
what you thought
was a gold medal performance,

35:36.509 --> 35:38.803
what the crowd is going crazy for,

35:39.512 --> 35:42.807
is not a gold medal performance,
it's a silver medal performance.

35:45.434 --> 35:48.855
[melancholic music playing]

35:48.938 --> 35:52.567
The moments before we had
to go out for the medal ceremony…

35:53.609 --> 35:56.404
it was really hard for me
to get myself together.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.490
I remember putting my head
in David's shoulder

35:59.574 --> 36:01.826
and just saying, like,
"I can't believe this."

36:06.289 --> 36:09.250
[announcer] Winner of the silver medal,
representing Canada,

36:10.334 --> 36:13.754
Jamie Salé and David Pelletier.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.550
Captured the hearts of the crowd,

36:18.384 --> 36:20.720
after it appeared to be
a foregone conclusion

36:20.803 --> 36:22.513
they would win the gold medal.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.099
[David] We went to get our medal.

36:25.683 --> 36:26.976
I remember thinking,

36:28.060 --> 36:29.979
"You're gonna hold your head high."

36:31.355 --> 36:33.357
[announcer]
A little tough to smile, maybe.

36:33.441 --> 36:34.650
But the crowd helps.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.074
And the gold.

36:44.869 --> 36:48.039
[Elena] The podium
and everything was great.

36:48.122 --> 36:52.335
We were proud to be Russian.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.797
We were the happiest people in the world.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.551
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise for the national anthem

37:00.635 --> 37:03.262
of the gold medalist,
the Russian Federation.

37:08.768 --> 37:09.602
[Jamie] It was hard.

37:09.685 --> 37:14.357
I felt like I was missing my moment that
I had always visualized and dreamed of.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.818
Not only getting
the gold medal around my neck,

37:17.902 --> 37:19.695
but seeing our flag in the middle…

37:20.863 --> 37:22.657
and singing "O, Canada."

37:30.831 --> 37:32.416
[announcer] So the Russian domination

37:32.500 --> 37:35.878
of Olympic pairs skating
continues here in Salt Lake City.

37:41.884 --> 37:45.137
[David] At the press conference,
you could feel tension in the air.

37:45.763 --> 37:48.933
You could feel that the result
didn't sit well with people.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.437
[Christine] So many journalists
were hearing from their offices

37:53.521 --> 37:56.440
or hearing from family members,
saying it was wrong.

37:57.024 --> 38:00.987
We're sad to come second, but nothing will
ever take away the performance we did.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.406
And… that's the way it is.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.742
Our silver medal is worth a gold to us.

38:07.535 --> 38:11.622
We kept our answers short and as much as
I was feeling sorry for myself,

38:11.706 --> 38:15.459
I really didn't wanna portray that I was
being a poor sport about this whole thing.

38:16.627 --> 38:19.380
Paul Martini,
whom you know well and respect,

38:20.006 --> 38:22.174
said, one, you were robbed,

38:22.258 --> 38:24.552
and two, the judges are cowards.

38:27.221 --> 38:29.223
[voice breaks] Nothing to say I guess.

38:31.475 --> 38:35.604
The mark the judges give is not objective

38:35.688 --> 38:37.732
because it's not measured by

38:38.399 --> 38:42.153
seconds, meters, kilograms, or whatever.

38:42.236 --> 38:44.780
They judge because of their taste.

38:45.323 --> 38:49.744
I explain, somebody likes meat,
somebody likes fish.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.412
So who is…

38:52.330 --> 38:53.372
who is right?

38:53.456 --> 38:58.210
Sometimes, we can understand why somebody
would maybe have that skater first,

38:58.294 --> 39:01.756
or pair-- And you would have it second.
It was so close, but…

39:02.256 --> 39:05.509
on the night with those two performances…

39:07.053 --> 39:08.304
it wasn't close.

39:13.934 --> 39:18.356
[Craig] That night, the Olympic Village
was buzzing with rumors about the result.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.109
I was talking to all kinds of people,
and I'm thinking,

39:22.193 --> 39:25.196
"Holy smokes, maybe there's--
there's something to this," you know?

39:25.279 --> 39:28.115
[foreboding music playing]

39:32.078 --> 39:33.788
[phone ringing]

39:34.413 --> 39:36.290
[Christine]
So it's about one in the morning.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.293
And my cell phone rings.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.297
And it's certainly

39:43.381 --> 39:46.967
one of the most interesting phone calls
I've ever received in my career.

39:48.552 --> 39:50.137
The source tells me,

39:50.221 --> 39:55.101
"You will not believe what just happened
in the lobby of the judges' hotel."

39:55.810 --> 39:58.687
[tense music builds]

39:58.771 --> 40:03.692
[Sally] I was at the hotel 
and the French judge, Marie Le Gougne,

40:03.776 --> 40:05.736
ran over to me.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.740
I'd known her for a few years,

40:09.824 --> 40:13.953
'cause she's been on the judging scene
internationally for quite a long time.

40:14.787 --> 40:15.913
And she said,

40:15.996 --> 40:19.291
"Sally, Sally… you've got to help me."

40:19.875 --> 40:23.003
"You don't understand. I had to do it."

40:23.504 --> 40:25.381
"It was a deal with the Russians."

40:27.716 --> 40:29.593
It's just streaming out of her.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.555
I don't know what to make of it.

40:33.347 --> 40:34.890
Never seen a judge so

40:35.391 --> 40:37.768
wrought up and tense and emotional.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.480
Oh. My. God.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.819
[reporter]
As we've been reporting all morning,

40:46.902 --> 40:50.656
a major controversy has erupted
at the Salt Lake Ice Center last night.

40:50.739 --> 40:53.701
Was the French judge pressured?
And if she was pressured,

40:53.784 --> 40:55.286
was she also influenced?

40:57.455 --> 41:00.249
[Jamie] And the next day, when we woke up,
journalists were saying

41:00.332 --> 41:03.919
that one of the judges
had potentially been involved in a fix.

41:04.628 --> 41:08.966
I just remember sitting back with Dave
going, "What?" Like, "What?"

41:10.634 --> 41:14.930
It was all speculation and rumors
and it was like massive wildfire.

41:15.931 --> 41:17.808
This needs to be sorted out, you know,

41:17.892 --> 41:20.603
if something happened
with the panel of judges,

41:20.686 --> 41:22.480
it-- it definitely needs to be sorted out.

41:22.563 --> 41:25.441
The judging appeared to be a return
to the Cold War era.

41:25.524 --> 41:28.277
Former Eastern Bloc countries
voting for the Russians,

41:28.360 --> 41:30.571
Western Bloc countries
voting for the Canadians.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.909
[Christine]
And so you're looking at the scores,

41:34.992 --> 41:37.578
four judges for the Russians.

41:38.078 --> 41:40.664
Russia, Ukraine, China, Poland.

41:41.707 --> 41:44.251
The four for the Canadians

41:44.335 --> 41:48.130
are the US and Canada,
Germany and Japan.

41:49.632 --> 41:50.466
Four to four.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.843
Looks like it's East and West.

41:52.927 --> 41:55.513
But there is no doubt, as you look at it,

41:55.596 --> 41:57.139
that the ninth vote,

41:57.806 --> 41:59.266
the one that decides it

41:59.350 --> 42:01.852
is the French judge,
Marie-Reine Le Gougne.

42:03.812 --> 42:06.899
[David] Surprised. Shocked. Confused.

42:07.900 --> 42:08.859
What does that mean?

42:08.943 --> 42:11.153
Robbed. We're talking about the decision

42:11.237 --> 42:14.198
to give the Russian figure skating pair
the gold medal last night.

42:15.908 --> 42:18.160
[Elena] We watching
everything unfold on TV.

42:18.244 --> 42:20.829
We were shocked
by what they were saying about us.

42:21.956 --> 42:26.919
All the TV say French judge
came everywhere saying,

42:27.002 --> 42:30.005
"Listen, I fixed my marks."

42:33.008 --> 42:33.968
How?

42:34.051 --> 42:36.178
Who forced her to fix?

42:36.762 --> 42:38.556
Who? How it happened?

42:42.518 --> 42:46.981
The morning after the event,
we were all in a state of shock.

42:47.064 --> 42:50.526
The nine judges
have to meet with the referee.

42:51.193 --> 42:55.030
And we all have to justify our marks.

42:55.948 --> 42:58.450
As soon as the elevator open…

42:59.493 --> 43:01.495
the press, the media,

43:02.246 --> 43:05.332
all the microphones,
they were following each of us.

43:05.416 --> 43:09.253
They had to tape the door to make sure
no microphone was gonna come in the room.

43:10.713 --> 43:13.340
I felt like it were what we see in movies.

43:15.134 --> 43:16.510
Then I saw Marie-Reine.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.557
[Christine] Now, all eyes are on this,

43:21.640 --> 43:25.686
and if there's one meeting room
I ever wanted to be in, it was that one.

43:26.186 --> 43:29.064
It was very tense,
very tense in that room.

43:29.148 --> 43:32.234
[tense music playing]

43:32.318 --> 43:36.030
The referee asked Marie-Reine,
"Why did you give such a mark?"

43:38.324 --> 43:40.909
And then Marie-Reine right away said

43:41.577 --> 43:43.454
she had not done what was right.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.583
You could hear a pin drop.

43:50.044 --> 43:53.088
People were crying.
People didn't know what to say.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.923
People felt betrayed.

43:56.175 --> 43:59.970
And then Marie-Reine said these words,

44:00.054 --> 44:01.847
"It's all Didier's fault."

44:05.184 --> 44:08.937
She was blaming Didier Gailhaguet,
the president of the federation,

44:09.438 --> 44:11.482
who was her boss.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.902
[chuckling] This is-- This is a big deal.

44:15.527 --> 44:18.364
This is a very, very big deal.

44:19.782 --> 44:22.034
In this small world of figure skating,

44:22.117 --> 44:25.496
Didier Gailhaguet is just as powerful
as anyone could be.

44:26.288 --> 44:27.456
Kind of like a puppeteer.

44:27.539 --> 44:30.834
He can control what judges
to send to what events.

44:31.710 --> 44:35.881
The French are denying any pressure
was exerted, but make no mistake,

44:35.964 --> 44:39.301
this continues to explode
around these Winter games.

44:40.052 --> 44:42.596
There was so much being unraveled.

44:43.305 --> 44:45.015
The onion layers were coming off.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.438
[Christine]
Didier Gailhaguet is denying everything.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.900
[Didier] I don't see
why the French Federation

44:54.983 --> 44:58.654
would press the French judge,
Marie-Reine Le Gougne,

44:58.737 --> 45:02.783
first of all, because we have
no athletes in this competition.

45:04.535 --> 45:08.747
I am sure that
the French Skating Association

45:08.831 --> 45:11.875
will be-- Will not be charged of anything.

45:11.959 --> 45:14.461
This sport is amazing to me.
I have defended this sport,

45:14.545 --> 45:16.630
and defended this sport,
and defended this sport.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.132
I cannot defend it this morning.

45:23.846 --> 45:27.057
[Jamie] This isn't the first time
there's been corruption in figure skating.

45:27.558 --> 45:30.310
And it's a tough one to live with.
It's a tough one to deal with.

45:31.019 --> 45:33.063
[reporter]
Skating has historically been plagued

45:33.147 --> 45:35.107
by criticism of biased judging.

45:35.190 --> 45:38.110
These two judges
at the 1999 World Championships

45:38.193 --> 45:42.072
were caught signaling each other
and accused of rigging the results.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.575
[reporter 2] 
The Russian judge on the right

45:44.658 --> 45:48.662
is moving his foot with intent
while the Ukrainian judge is watching.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.457
[Jamie] We've grown up with this.

45:51.540 --> 45:55.586
It's a bias sport where I've seen
wrongful judging and cheating.

45:57.129 --> 45:58.630
But this was the Olympics.

45:59.131 --> 46:01.091
It took on a whole other level.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.559
[Bill McCausland] I'm a huge sports fan.

46:10.642 --> 46:12.603
And I particularly like the Olympics.

46:13.854 --> 46:17.399
February of 2002, I was watching
the Winter Olympic Games,

46:17.483 --> 46:19.735
watching the pair figure skating,

46:20.319 --> 46:24.031
And it was quite clear
something had gone amiss.

46:25.365 --> 46:28.076
We made contact
with the Salt Lake City office of the FBI.

46:30.454 --> 46:32.539
They interviewed Didier Gailhaguet.

46:33.540 --> 46:36.376
He denied that he pressured
Le Gougne, obviously.

46:37.753 --> 46:40.839
But he said he had been contacted
two years earlier

46:40.923 --> 46:43.842
about a different matter
by a Russian mafia figure.

46:44.343 --> 46:46.887
And it was brought to my attention

46:46.970 --> 46:50.933
because I'm one of the experts
in Russian Eurasian organized crime.

46:53.143 --> 46:56.188
So while the media circus was going on,

46:57.147 --> 47:00.108
we were able to work discreetly
behind the scenes

47:01.318 --> 47:03.529
and assemble our investigation.

47:04.321 --> 47:07.407
Are there crimes that took place,
and what can we do?

47:15.457 --> 47:17.876
[Craig] The media loved a juicy story…

47:19.378 --> 47:21.421
and this was about as juicy as it got.

47:22.965 --> 47:25.008
I really felt that we should do

47:25.092 --> 47:28.679
every conceivable
media appearance we could.

47:29.471 --> 47:32.099
To get them
what I considered to be justice.

47:33.725 --> 47:35.269
[Jamie] Craig blew it up.

47:37.062 --> 47:39.815
We went from doing maybe
two or three interviews to doing 20.

47:39.898 --> 47:42.276
We would be lying
if we said we weren't disappointed.

47:42.359 --> 47:44.736
I mean, we're human beings too,
and we went out there

47:44.820 --> 47:48.282
and poured our hearts out into our
performance, and we skated fabulous.

47:48.365 --> 47:51.743
And the Americans
really adopted us as their own.

47:51.827 --> 47:54.079
-And I'm going to wear Canada,
-[man] Good.

47:54.162 --> 47:57.082
Something Canadian until they give
those two kids the gold medal.

47:57.165 --> 47:58.750
-[audience cheering]
-[man] Excellent!

47:58.834 --> 47:59.877
I'm so angry!

47:59.960 --> 48:03.338
[Jamie] We became overnight, you know,
not just Canada's sweethearts,

48:03.422 --> 48:06.341
but America's sweethearts
and like household names.

48:06.425 --> 48:07.509
You'll go down in history.

48:07.593 --> 48:10.053
You'll be the most famous thing 
that occurred in this Olympics.

48:11.638 --> 48:13.473
[Jamie] Our faces were everywhere.

48:14.558 --> 48:16.685
And then Jay Leno sends his jet.

48:16.768 --> 48:18.854
I'm on The Tonight Show
with Charlie Sheen.

48:18.937 --> 48:22.232
From Canada, please welcome
Jamie Salé and David Pelletier.

48:24.359 --> 48:25.736
[David] It was surreal.

48:25.819 --> 48:28.322
I mean, I know biker guys going
"They got screwed!"

48:28.405 --> 48:31.742
Guys that never watch figure skating
who essentially, you know--

48:31.825 --> 48:34.328
I mean, Harley guys
are watching figure skating now

48:34.411 --> 48:36.538
because-- because, you know,
they feel for you guys.

48:39.541 --> 48:44.421
We felt disgusted. "Why aren't
the media coming to talk to us?"

48:44.504 --> 48:48.884
We hear stuff like, "The Russians put
the medals around their own necks,"

48:48.967 --> 48:51.678
and "They stole the gold."

48:54.097 --> 48:55.933
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

48:56.892 --> 49:00.062
[Elena] Well, of course
we feel like complete shit.

49:01.396 --> 49:03.690
[reporter] Do you feel
you deserved to win the gold?

49:03.774 --> 49:04.608
Yes. Sure.

49:04.691 --> 49:07.235
[Tamara] We now need to defend ourselves,

49:07.319 --> 49:11.198
because we cannot accept
those accusations.

49:11.990 --> 49:14.952
I never gave any…

49:15.035 --> 49:17.037
anybody, anybody

49:17.120 --> 49:21.375
any money or… whatever.

49:21.458 --> 49:24.920
This, I can give you my… hand

49:25.545 --> 49:28.173
to be cut if I am saying a lie.

49:28.256 --> 49:32.010
-[reporter] Will you keep the gold?
-Yes, because we are Olympic champions.

49:34.054 --> 49:37.683
There was a couple of times
when we're skating, how we think, better

49:37.766 --> 49:40.268
and they was first, and we were second.

49:41.019 --> 49:45.357
But we never go somewhere and said,
"Okay, let's do the big scandal."

49:45.440 --> 49:47.734
The Russians hadn't lost the gold medal

49:47.818 --> 49:51.697
in that event in 40-- 40 years,
and they weren't about to start now.

49:51.780 --> 49:53.699
[speaking Russian]

49:53.782 --> 49:57.577
[translator] "These are simply people
who don't know how to lose gracefully."

49:57.661 --> 49:58.662
[speaking Russian]

49:58.745 --> 50:01.081
[translator 2]
"Our pair was simply more artistic,

50:01.164 --> 50:03.125
and that's why
they were given more points."

50:03.208 --> 50:07.129
As for the allegations of a deal between
the French and Russian judges,

50:07.212 --> 50:09.131
well, nobody here really believes that.

50:09.214 --> 50:13.343
If anything, the feeling is that it is
the West that is ganging up on Russia

50:13.427 --> 50:15.887
to deny it what it won fair and square.

50:15.971 --> 50:17.806
Is it good for the sport?

50:18.348 --> 50:21.852
And isn't it the… beginning

50:21.935 --> 50:24.104
of the Cold War?

50:26.273 --> 50:28.442
[Christine] This controversy is exploding.

50:28.525 --> 50:31.820
It's becoming one of the biggest scandals
in Olympic history.

50:33.321 --> 50:36.074
[Tom Brokaw] In Salt Lake City tonight,
the allegations of cheating

50:36.158 --> 50:37.993
and the judging of pairs figure skating

50:38.076 --> 50:42.914
is a story with more twists and turns
than the routines of the competitors.

50:42.998 --> 50:46.084
The judge at the center
of the pairs scandal went public today

50:46.168 --> 50:47.335
and changed her story.

50:47.419 --> 50:50.672
At first, she said she voted for
the Russians because she was pressured.

50:51.548 --> 50:55.052
Now she said she voted for them
because they were the best.

50:57.596 --> 51:01.433
I have judged with my soul
and my conscious, and why have--

51:01.516 --> 51:05.353
When I have decided to have
the Russian couple on the first place,

51:06.063 --> 51:10.192
I was quite aware at that moment--
I am still aware of that,

51:10.275 --> 51:13.445
--that they were the best that night.

51:16.406 --> 51:20.368
[Craig] She clearly was a pawn in it.
No question about it in my mind.

51:20.452 --> 51:23.622
She recanted her confession.

51:27.250 --> 51:31.505
But by then, cat was out of the bag
and-- and the wheels were turning.

51:31.588 --> 51:33.590
[reporters clamoring]

51:34.841 --> 51:37.302
[Christine] The president
of the International Skating Union

51:37.385 --> 51:40.514
is Ottavio Cinquanta,
so now he's thrown into this mess.

51:41.348 --> 51:42.307
What is this?

51:42.974 --> 51:43.809
Is an ambush?

51:44.726 --> 51:48.313
[Christine] He runs the sport.
And if this is gonna be investigated,

51:48.396 --> 51:51.942
he's gonna be the one investigating it.
He calls this press conference

51:52.025 --> 51:54.778
where everyone
is just firing questions left and right.

51:54.861 --> 51:59.241
Have you received
any verbal or written proof

51:59.324 --> 52:02.702
that indicates that there
was a possibility of impropriety?

52:02.786 --> 52:05.247
It's a very simple question.
It takes a "yes" or "no."

52:05.831 --> 52:11.253
I have received not proof,
but allegation, accusation, not proof.

52:11.336 --> 52:13.797
But I do not have the power
to change the result.

52:14.965 --> 52:18.593
[Christine] This is quite a spot
that Ottavio Cinquanta is in.

52:18.677 --> 52:22.139
You don't want cheating going on
and scandal going on in your sport.

52:22.722 --> 52:27.310
But Didier Gailhaguet is one
of his colleagues, his friends.

52:27.394 --> 52:29.479
This is a very incestuous group.

52:30.230 --> 52:32.774
I mean, this is a European boys' club,

52:33.316 --> 52:35.986
old, white men running figure skating.

52:37.154 --> 52:41.324
I am not in a condition
for taking a prompt investigation.

52:41.408 --> 52:43.243
[Christine] It's kind of unbelievable

52:43.326 --> 52:45.370
that you've got
Cinquanta saying he's gonna wait

52:45.453 --> 52:47.205
before he starts that investigation.

52:48.373 --> 52:51.459
Why wouldn't you wanna sweep it
under the rug? Because it looks bad.

52:51.543 --> 52:53.920
It's better just to hide it.
Let's hide this, right?

52:55.463 --> 52:57.674
[Craig]
All institutions protect themselves.

52:58.717 --> 53:01.928
I think it was getting a little too hot
for them in the kitchen,

53:02.012 --> 53:06.892
and they wanted to tamp that down
and get back to their Olympics.

53:08.310 --> 53:10.604
But I wanted to keep that pressure on.

53:11.354 --> 53:13.732
[reporter] This afternoon,
Canada's Olympic delegation

53:13.815 --> 53:15.859
asked for an official investigation.

53:17.402 --> 53:19.571
[David] We're not saying 
we deserved the-- the gold,

53:19.654 --> 53:21.239
or we should've got the gold.

53:21.323 --> 53:22.490
What we're saying is…

53:23.325 --> 53:27.913
this is wrong because there is word
that… somebody cheated.

53:32.250 --> 53:34.836
[Craig] And then suddenly we get a call…

53:34.920 --> 53:36.087
[ringing]

53:37.130 --> 53:40.300
…from somebody that had Russian accent.

53:41.176 --> 53:42.928
And, uh, the voice said,

53:43.720 --> 53:48.475
"Tell those Canadians
to accept the silver medal and shut up."

53:49.184 --> 53:50.518
It was like… [gasps]

53:50.602 --> 53:54.564
"Oh, my gosh, okay, now-- now it's gotten
to a level that I feel unsafe."

53:57.150 --> 53:58.777
[Bill] During the investigation,

53:58.860 --> 54:02.614
we picked up some interesting
conversations on a wiretap

54:02.697 --> 54:05.158
of a well-known Russian
organized crime figure

54:05.242 --> 54:06.576
named Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov.

54:09.329 --> 54:12.290
Tokhtakhounov is involved
in human trafficking,

54:12.374 --> 54:14.876
arms dealing, drug trafficking,

54:15.794 --> 54:18.129
all types of grifts across Europe.

54:18.838 --> 54:21.967
And there were conversations
with a Russian co-conspirator

54:22.050 --> 54:23.677
that were a bit unusual.

54:28.139 --> 54:32.102
Tokhtakhounov seemed to have some sway
in how the votes went down

54:32.185 --> 54:33.979
in the Salt Lake City Olympics.

54:40.443 --> 54:41.820
Armed with those phone calls,

54:41.903 --> 54:45.865
we were able to identify
that bribery had taken place there.

54:46.574 --> 54:50.495
A crime that sort of strikes at the heart
of, like, the integrity of sports.

54:50.578 --> 54:55.208
Today, a new figure entered
the great skating drama of 2002,

54:55.875 --> 54:57.752
a man thought to be a Russian mobster.

54:58.503 --> 55:01.506
[reporter] Investigators charged
that Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov

55:01.589 --> 55:04.092
and others were involved
in a quid pro quo.

55:05.051 --> 55:08.388
In return for the French judge's vote
for the Russian pairs team,

55:08.471 --> 55:11.516
the Russians would ensure
that the French ice dancing team

55:11.599 --> 55:14.227
would win the gold medal
in that competition.

55:15.353 --> 55:19.816
[Christine] Ice dancing is the other pairs
skating competition at the Olympics.

55:19.899 --> 55:22.319
The difference between
pairs figure skating and ice dancing

55:22.402 --> 55:25.405
is in ice dancing they don't jump.
It's dancing on the ice.

55:27.615 --> 55:30.660
The French needed
that Russian vote for ice dancing.

55:31.661 --> 55:34.581
And the Russians needed
the French vote for pairs.

55:35.123 --> 55:37.083
You vote for ours, we'll vote for yours.

55:38.585 --> 55:41.963
It was corrupt, it was wrong,
it was terrible, but it was simple.

55:43.340 --> 55:46.718
…that the long arm
of Russian organized crime

55:46.801 --> 55:49.262
reached across the globe
this past February.

55:50.555 --> 55:55.268
[Bill] Tokhtakhounov was charged with
tampering with a gold medal event.

55:56.686 --> 55:59.522
If convicted of those charges,
he was facing years in prison.

56:01.649 --> 56:04.235
But he probably fled back to Russia.

56:06.112 --> 56:09.032
I'll never believe it's possible
as long as I live.

56:09.115 --> 56:11.659
How could something like this even happen?

56:11.743 --> 56:16.539
Somebody tried to make
our names close with some mafia.

56:16.623 --> 56:17.999
-Crime.
-It's not right.

56:20.001 --> 56:21.127
Who? Mafia?

56:21.711 --> 56:24.130
Now we're talking about Russian mafia.
Where is it?

56:24.214 --> 56:26.466
[inhales and sighs loudly]

56:26.549 --> 56:27.425
Where is it?

56:35.350 --> 56:37.894
[Craig] Five days after the competition,

56:37.977 --> 56:41.481
I got a call from the Olympic Committee
saying it had made a decision.

56:42.732 --> 56:45.735
Craig said, "We're sending a car
at the Olympic Village,

56:45.819 --> 56:47.529
you're gonna come to my hotel room."

56:47.612 --> 56:51.741
[reporter] Right, we're going to pick up
live coverage of the news conference now.

56:51.825 --> 56:53.868
As the principles take the dais.

56:54.411 --> 56:56.746
We sat there
and watched this press conference.

56:56.830 --> 57:00.375
We have suspended with immediate effect

57:01.251 --> 57:03.878
the judge of figure skating,

57:04.879 --> 57:06.881
Ms. Marie-Reine Le Gougne,

57:06.965 --> 57:11.219
and Mr. Didier Gailhaguet
for a period of three years.

57:13.721 --> 57:15.640
[Jamie] You thought
you would get away with it.

57:16.683 --> 57:18.101
But you didn't.

57:20.228 --> 57:22.313
Like, you know, karma. [chuckles]

57:22.397 --> 57:26.359
I think this French judge, Peter,
we will never see her judge again.

57:29.070 --> 57:31.448
[inaudible]

57:32.907 --> 57:35.535
[Jamie] And then there was
another announcement.

57:36.119 --> 57:40.790
We received an official proposal
from the International Skating Union

57:40.874 --> 57:44.461
and a gold medal will be awarded
to the Canadian pair.

57:45.545 --> 57:47.964
[all cheering]

57:49.674 --> 57:51.468
[reporter]
Well, after a week of controversy,

57:51.551 --> 57:55.180
Canadian skaters Jamie Salé
and David Pelletier

57:55.263 --> 57:57.765
will finally have their golden moment.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.143
[Jamie] They announced that we'd share

58:00.226 --> 58:02.937
the gold medal position 
with Anton and Elena.

58:03.730 --> 58:05.815
It was just like… my head was spinning.

58:05.899 --> 58:07.901
[crowd cheering and applauding]

58:11.029 --> 58:14.365
[hopeful music playing]

58:16.326 --> 58:18.828
[reporter 2] 
And so silver medals turn to gold,

58:18.912 --> 58:22.081
not by the alchemist's magic,
but by decree.

58:27.879 --> 58:31.216
[Jamie] There were rumors
and speculation, but truthfully,

58:31.299 --> 58:36.012
I don't know if Anton and Elena
were involved in the fix.

58:37.055 --> 58:39.432
[crowd cheering]

58:41.434 --> 58:42.435
We were all smiling,

58:42.519 --> 58:44.854
and everybody was doing
the best that we could

58:44.938 --> 58:46.773
with the situation that we were in.

58:46.856 --> 58:49.317
But it was just really uncomfortable.

58:52.403 --> 58:56.157
The last thing on my list would've had
Ottavio Cinquanta giving me my medal.

58:58.451 --> 59:00.203
But that's what they decided.

59:08.169 --> 59:11.631
[Elena] They tried to make things right

59:11.714 --> 59:14.425
saying everyone can have a gold medal.

59:14.509 --> 59:15.510
Hooray!

59:15.593 --> 59:18.513
World peace! [chuckling]

59:20.139 --> 59:23.351
[David] Sport is full of corrupt people.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.981
And the West is
just as guilty as the East.

59:28.064 --> 59:29.524
It's a political game.

59:38.533 --> 59:42.287
[reporter 2] Now they walk away 
both champions, both winners,

59:42.370 --> 59:46.249
and now some serious reform
in figure skating judging.

1:00:29.542 --> 1:00:33.338
