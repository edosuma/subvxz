WEBVTT

00:33.159 --> 00:36.120
What's a pretty little thing like you
doing out here all alone?

00:36.287 --> 00:39.290
No, no, no.

00:39.457 --> 00:41.459
Come here.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.759
Angie.

00:55.181 --> 00:56.265
I'm sorry, what?

00:56.432 --> 00:59.685
Group therapy.
Have you thought any more about it?

00:59.852 --> 01:03.147
I really think that it would help you
to spend some time around people

01:03.314 --> 01:05.775
who share your experience.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.818
No, no, no!

01:09.070 --> 01:10.696
My experience?

01:11.947 --> 01:13.365
Dreams again?

01:16.994 --> 01:18.996
Do we have to do this today?

01:19.163 --> 01:21.332
Yes.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.044
Okay.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.819
Prance, show-horse.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.904
Sweetie!

02:00.746 --> 02:02.248
Hey, Angie.
Hey, Angie, wait up.

02:02.414 --> 02:03.999
Please don't call me that.

02:04.166 --> 02:08.002
Come on, what is it?
I mean, do I smell?

02:08.169 --> 02:09.880
I have bad breath?

02:10.047 --> 02:11.882
I just don't like
to be called Angie.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.886
One minute.
What happened to you?

02:16.053 --> 02:17.888
I'm just trying
to be friends here.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.724
- Why?
- What's wrong with being friendly?

02:20.891 --> 02:22.852
- Jesus.
- Go make friends with Gloria.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.396
- Or Saperstein.
- You're really tough.

02:25.563 --> 02:29.233
Look, not everybody's trying
to get into your pants.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.569
No, not everyone.
But you are.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.496
Nice tits.

02:46.584 --> 02:47.960
Great ass, too.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.916
Damn, girl.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.126
Where you running to
all fast like that, huh, girl?

04:11.293 --> 04:12.962
Looking good.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.214
Take you to the back of Dingo's car.
Ain't that right, Dingo?

04:15.381 --> 04:17.548
Yeah.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.094
Whoa, where you going?

04:20.261 --> 04:22.805
Name's Chief, baby.

04:22.972 --> 04:24.223
What's your name?

04:25.474 --> 04:27.559
Damn!

04:31.313 --> 04:33.691
Oh, you ain't got--
you ain't got no name.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.776
Okay.
That's cool, too, baby.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.789
If you're having dreams
when you're awake,

04:48.956 --> 04:50.374
that means you're crazy,
doesn't it?

04:50.541 --> 04:52.043
Not necessarily.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.670
Are you having dreams
while you're awake?

04:54.837 --> 04:57.047
More like fantasies.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.384
What do you fantasize about?

05:00.551 --> 05:02.094
Justice.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.179
What about it?

05:04.346 --> 05:07.683
You don't feel that
you've received justice?

05:07.850 --> 05:10.269
Justice isn't something
you receive.

05:10.436 --> 05:12.438
It's something
you dish out.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.190
Is that from a fortune cookie?

05:16.442 --> 05:19.611
Out there,
it's all predators and prey.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.947
You're either one or the other.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.325
What about friends?

05:24.491 --> 05:26.452
Everybody's after something.

05:26.618 --> 05:29.788
Protection.
Companionship. Whatever.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.499
But you're either getting or giving
no matter what you call it.

05:33.751 --> 05:35.252
That may be a bit narrow.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.588
You don't believe in altruism?

05:37.755 --> 05:40.257
You mean the do-gooders?

05:40.424 --> 05:42.760
Can't stand the do-gooders.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.512
They're the ones who think
they really aren't after anything.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.181
They just want to be friends.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.933
Like that's some magical gift
to the universe

05:50.100 --> 05:51.727
with no strings attached.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.063
Pretty bleak world view.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.690
There's always strings attached.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.657
- Need a lift?
- No.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.243
Come on, Angie--
Angela. Angela.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.412
You know,
if you ask really nicely,

06:10.579 --> 06:13.290
I'm sure Saperstein will give you
a handy in the supply closet.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.420
Look, not every guy
is an asshole.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.923
But you'll never know that if you
don't give somebody a chance.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.232
They say that rape
is about power, not sex,

06:38.399 --> 06:40.734
but that's kind of bullshit.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.237
Of course it's about sex.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.989
It's very specifically
about sex.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.826
To hurt you as deeply
as possible.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.661
Complete devastation.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.746
Like when soldiers
don't just defeat their enemy,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.749
they burn their villages
and foul their water supply, you know?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.377
Don't just kill the natives,
kill the buffalo.

06:58.544 --> 07:02.172
Kill what's sacred to them
so the body is just a shell

07:02.339 --> 07:04.883
to be crushed
beneath your boot.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.846
Thank you so much for sharing
with us this night, Mallory.

07:09.012 --> 07:12.516
Your views are always...
illuminating.

07:12.683 --> 07:15.185
I do want to take a moment

07:15.352 --> 07:17.729
to welcome a new member
to the group tonight.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.357
Everyone, this is Angela.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.401
Hi, Angela.

07:22.568 --> 07:25.696
Now, Angela,
as this is a sacred space

07:25.863 --> 07:30.284
where it is safe to share, I do invite
you to share with us tonight.

07:30.451 --> 07:33.287
I'd rather not.

07:34.913 --> 07:38.625
That's okay.
There's no pressure here.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.337
Everybody participates
at their own pace.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.549
Now might be a good time
to take a quick potty break

07:45.716 --> 07:49.219
and let you caffeine drinkers
get your fix of free coffee.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.390
Are you all right, dear?

07:59.271 --> 08:00.731
Hi.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.650
I'm Oscar Kosca.

08:03.817 --> 08:07.196
Spelled with a SCA
but pronounced like a Z.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.406
Nobody gets it right.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.576
Angela Jitrenka.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.828
Ah, it's Czech, isn't it?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.163
Yeah.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.916
Yeah, Jitrenka.
It means morning star.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.751
Like Lucifer.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.377
I'm Sorry?

08:22.544 --> 08:25.672
Lucifer was also called
Morning Star.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.634
Venus is actually
the morning star

08:28.800 --> 08:31.136
since it precedes the sun
in the sky,

08:31.303 --> 08:33.429
but the Romans
called it Lux Ferre.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.349
Lucifer.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.433
I thought he was the devil.

08:37.601 --> 08:41.270
And God's most beautiful angel
before the fall.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.775
One of the avenging
angels, actually.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.361
You know a lot about this.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.156
Well, my daughter,

08:51.323 --> 08:53.325
she knew all the angels.

08:53.492 --> 08:56.245
She knew their names.
She knew which one was for what.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.871
You know, all that stuff.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.791
Her room was just covered
with angels.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.460
Just wings and--

09:03.627 --> 09:05.462
and I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.635
She's dead.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.929
His daughter,
I mean.

09:14.096 --> 09:17.224
The guy who raped her
got off on some technicality.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.435
She killed herself.
Cops and lawyers, right?

09:20.602 --> 09:24.481
He's way fucked up.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.943
I need a smoke.
Want one?

09:46.837 --> 09:48.880
First time?

09:49.047 --> 09:52.843
No, but it's been a while.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.178
First group.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.014
Yeah.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.516
Don't worry.
I won't ask.

09:59.683 --> 10:03.145
I'm sure I'll hear all about it
in one of our little weep sessions.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.855
How do you stand it?

10:05.022 --> 10:07.899
Ha, it's better than
slitting my wrists.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.110
I think.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.489
Look, it's not--

10:14.656 --> 10:17.868
I mean, I keep coming back,
you know?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.244
It must be doing something.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.079
But some days--

10:21.246 --> 10:24.791
some days
I'd rather not think about it.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.544
You know?
Of course, if I could do that,

10:27.711 --> 10:30.172
I wouldn't be here
in the first place.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.844
Maybe I'll see you around.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.387
You're not going back in?

10:37.554 --> 10:40.474
I've had enough victims
for one night.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.268
See you next time, maybe.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.037
What's up, baby girl?

11:02.204 --> 11:03.789
I waited for you all night.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.333
What's the matter, sweetie?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.168
Got something special for you.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.046
Something special?

11:11.213 --> 11:13.590
I hope you've got a tennis bracelet
down your pants,

11:13.757 --> 11:15.717
'cause there sure ain't nothing
special about your cock.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.095
It is a cock, right?

11:18.261 --> 11:20.597
It's not just like
a little puffy pussy?

11:20.764 --> 11:22.015
Back off, bitch.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.643
Oh, is that the best you got?

11:24.810 --> 11:27.938
You're never gonna get laid
with game like that, Chief.

11:28.105 --> 11:31.274
Get a job and a nice car,

11:31.441 --> 11:33.402
not that piece of shit
I see you driving around in.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.905
If you want pussy,
you're gonna have to pay for it

11:37.072 --> 11:40.367
'cause I really can't see anybody
fucking you for free.

11:42.119 --> 11:43.745
Dykes.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.581
It's a sad thing
when a straight woman

11:46.748 --> 11:49.668
would rather eat pussy
than fuck your sorry ass.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.296
Ooh! Shit!

11:52.462 --> 11:54.798
What the fuck was that, man?

11:54.965 --> 11:56.758
Don't mind them.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.261
Their cocks make them stupid.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.055
It's true.
I saw it in a documentary.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.391
It sucks all the blood
from their brains.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.309
The bigger their dicks,
the dumber they get.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.603
He must be hung
like a horse.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.189
Come on,
you're buying me a drink.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.526
- I live right there.
- Where?

12:14.693 --> 12:16.653
- On 14th.
- I'm on Elm.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.156
No kidding?
We should scissor each other.

12:19.322 --> 12:22.701
Shut up.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.287
So Chief's dad

12:25.454 --> 12:27.414
owns some, like, electronics
franchise or something.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.750
He's hardly an urban gangster.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.169
Well, if it's an act,
it scared me.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.963
I mean, do they have
mothers, sisters?

12:35.130 --> 12:36.840
How do they learn to speak
to women like that?

12:37.007 --> 12:39.551
You know what? I don't give a shit
how women are spoken to

12:39.718 --> 12:42.763
or objectified by rap music lyrics
or whatever.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.015
I mean,
people got raped in palaces

12:45.182 --> 12:46.683
where everybody spoke poetry.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.519
I'd rather he talked to me
like that than pretend.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.354
At least it's honest.
I mean, like, talking nice,

12:51.521 --> 12:53.398
it is just, like,
dressed-up bullshit.

12:53.565 --> 12:54.608
Yeah.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.651
- Like the do-gooders.
- Huh?

12:56.818 --> 12:58.612
Oh, nothing.
There's this guy at my work

12:58.779 --> 13:00.822
who just wants to be friends.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.575
Oh, yeah, he wants you to say hello
to his little friend.

13:03.742 --> 13:07.120
- His very little friend, most likely.
- Yes.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.539
No chance
he's one of the good ones?

13:09.706 --> 13:11.374
There are good ones?

13:11.541 --> 13:13.919
Yeah, sure. And unicorns, too.
Haven't you heard?

13:14.085 --> 13:16.087
I'll tell you what.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.508
He does put a hand on you,
you really ought to shank the bastard.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.468
I mean, it's an office, right?
Grab one of those letter openers,

13:21.635 --> 13:23.970
jab it in his inner thigh,
watch him bleed out.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.889
That's graphic.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.933
I'm sorry.
I just say whatever.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.560
I don't give a shit.
I'm so sorry.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.437
No, it's okay.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.731
All that political correctness
is pretty irritating anyway.

13:34.898 --> 13:35.899
Mm-hmm.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.151
That group lady Lynne
is really hard to take.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.737
She's a fucking idiot.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.698
Everything with her
is healing and forgiveness.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.617
I can't take that
turquoise Sedona bullshit.

13:45.784 --> 13:46.868
You know, you want
to give these women hope?

13:47.035 --> 13:48.703
Give them vengeance.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.330
Yeah.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.208
Well, I'm not sure
that fixes anything either.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.668
It fixes them.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.127
All these women
in abusive relationships,

13:56.294 --> 13:58.338
they should be learning
how to poison soup.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.882
Yes, but do you have
any extreme views?

14:01.049 --> 14:04.344
Look, I'm no angel.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.930
I've done some weird shit
in the bedroom.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.640
But that was consenting,
you know?

14:08.807 --> 14:11.059
When my ex
came at me with his...

14:14.437 --> 14:15.939
that was it.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.566
I'm done.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.317
I'm not kidding.
I'm not gonna be handled again.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.862
Not by anybody.
I mean, you trust someone,

14:22.028 --> 14:23.780
you let them in,
they fuck you up.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.157
Fuck that, you know?
And the cops won't help you.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.034
Nobody will help you.
You have to do it yourself.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.744
You have to walk out
and never look back.

14:29.911 --> 14:30.912
And if that doesn't work,

14:31.079 --> 14:32.831
you take a paring knife
and you fillet it like a fish.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.041
You pull the guts out
and you cut the fucking head off.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.337
How you doing?

14:58.023 --> 15:01.192
- I'm so grateful for this group.
- Thank you, Kensly.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.028
Want to get a beer after?

15:03.194 --> 15:04.487
- Cassie.
- Sure.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.364
Are you ready to share?

15:08.241 --> 15:10.952
My parents got divorced
when I was seven.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.915
My mom, she took it
really hard.

15:15.081 --> 15:19.002
And, you know, really.

15:22.380 --> 15:26.384
Well, it was a big deal
when she met Ron.

15:26.551 --> 15:30.555
You know, 'cause she'd been
so unhappy for so long

15:30.722 --> 15:34.935
and now she was happy again
and everybody was, like, relieved.

15:38.021 --> 15:41.232
And Ron was like this
big hero to everyone,

15:41.399 --> 15:44.611
which I always thought was pretty shitty
when you think about it, you know?

15:46.404 --> 15:49.324
So at first--

15:49.491 --> 15:52.202
at first I didn't say anything,

15:52.369 --> 15:55.497
like, when he started.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.379
And, you know,
the weirdest thing about it

16:02.545 --> 16:04.464
is that I still sometimes
think about it.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.384
Like all twisted around
and stuff.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.719
Like I deserved it
or something.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.222
And because of that,

16:12.389 --> 16:14.599
because I didn't say
something right away,

16:14.766 --> 16:17.268
like that meant that I liked
it or something.

16:19.229 --> 16:22.565
I don't know.
It's dumb or whatever.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.151
But that's just the way
I used to think about it.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.781
- Are you kidding me?
- The guy still lives there.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.117
How is that even possible?

16:32.283 --> 16:35.328
Well, the step-dad Ron,
he denied it.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.539
And the mom
never really believed

16:37.706 --> 16:40.458
that anything happened
in the first place, so...

16:40.625 --> 16:43.003
So she just has to live
with a guy who rapes her?

16:43.169 --> 16:44.838
Mmm-hmm.
And she's terrified--

16:45.005 --> 16:47.382
terrified that her mom's
gonna find out about group.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.592
She thinks she's smoking pot
with the neighbor.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.011
How fucked up is that?

16:51.177 --> 16:54.264
A teenager sneaking out
of the house for rape counseling.

16:54.431 --> 16:55.807
Shitty rape counseling.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.435
It's just what I'm always saying,
you know?

16:58.601 --> 17:01.396
Give a woman a fish and she makes
dinner for her piece-of-shit husband.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.189
Teach the woman to kill
the piece-of-shit husband,

17:03.356 --> 17:04.816
and she never has to make
dinner again.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.318
A message of hope.
It's beautiful, really.

17:07.484 --> 17:10.613
It's like an epidemic
of browbeaten women

17:10.780 --> 17:13.324
too afraid to stand up
against abusive men.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.076
I mean,
that's family values for you.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.787
Wives and daughters
trapped in little boxes

17:17.954 --> 17:19.955
stacked side by side
in neat little rows

17:20.123 --> 17:23.001
with monsters in there
torturing them year after year.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.711
That's the institution
of marriage

17:24.877 --> 17:26.963
that everybody
is so desperate to protect

17:27.130 --> 17:30.592
where women are slaves
to pedophiles and wife-beaters.

17:30.759 --> 17:33.511
That's the way
some of them want it.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.513
They get off on it.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.475
Can only come if they're
getting the shit beat out of them.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.935
That's the way mine is.

17:42.312 --> 17:45.523
Yeah, we're gonna need
some shots.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.319
- He's drunk.
- Come on.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.446
Oh, my God.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.615
He's so drunk.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.162
Man moves fast.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.831
He's like the fastest drunk
in the world.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.391
- What are you doing?
- He's got his-- I don't know.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.025
That how she likes it?

18:29.192 --> 18:31.152
You old fuck.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.449
Whoo-hoo!

18:38.535 --> 18:40.870
Whoo-hoo!

19:21.870 --> 19:24.164
Check it out.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.249
Adult circumcision.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.795
if you need a pole that long.

19:30.962 --> 19:34.465
Eh, this is more like it.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.094
This shit is just laying out.

19:38.261 --> 19:40.722
Not locked up or anything,
no background checks to buy one,

19:40.889 --> 19:44.601
and you can do some serious
damage with some of this.

19:44.767 --> 19:49.272
See, I'm an old-fashioned girl
with simpler tastes.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.819
Okay, okay, Madame Thor.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.114
Simplicity.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.951
Bare-knuckle simplicity.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.172
- Ow! Ow!
- Oops.

20:16.633 --> 20:19.177
Hey!

20:19.344 --> 20:22.305
 A friend?
- Isn't that what you wanted?

20:22.472 --> 20:24.390
It's not about what I want.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.101
Oh, can we skip
the Freudian double-talk, please?

20:27.268 --> 20:29.062
No, I call bullshit.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.522
You make a friend and you say
it's 'cause I wanted it?

20:31.689 --> 20:33.483
What do you want?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.610
Nobody out there is gonna
ask you that question

20:35.777 --> 20:36.986
'cause they don't give a shit.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.948
Do you?

20:40.114 --> 20:41.824
- Do I what?
- Give a shit.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.120
You're a pain in the ass.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.748
I believe that's Carl Jung
you're quoting, isn't it?

20:51.501 --> 20:53.127
Do you trust her?

20:53.294 --> 20:55.755
Do you feel like you
can trust a new person?

20:57.340 --> 21:00.134
What about strings? You said
everybody has strings attached.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.136
You still believe that?

21:04.764 --> 21:07.308
Absolutely.

21:07.475 --> 21:10.019
Bye.
Have a good day, Ron.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.188
Bye, honey.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.696
- Cassie, you're not gonna say bye?
- Got a hug for Daddy?

21:23.366 --> 21:25.493
Why are we here?

21:25.660 --> 21:27.370
Bye.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.708
I was curious.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.876
Why?

21:35.128 --> 21:37.422
Some people deserve
a dirty trick.

21:39.674 --> 21:42.051
Like a real dirty trick.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.811
And some people

21:51.978 --> 21:54.689
aren't strong enough
to deliver it themselves.

21:59.277 --> 22:00.820
What is wrong with you?

22:04.115 --> 22:06.451
What is the matter?
I don't understand.

22:06.617 --> 22:07.869
Sweetheart.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.213
These are my favorite.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.592
- Damn it, Ron.
- What?

22:29.599 --> 22:30.933
How long have you
been doing this?

22:31.100 --> 22:32.602
Uh, a couple days.

22:32.769 --> 22:33.853
How'd you find him?

22:34.020 --> 22:36.522
I followed Cassie.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.485
Hey, my mom told me

22:40.651 --> 22:44.364
that a good person does the right
thing even when no one is looking.

22:47.492 --> 22:50.912
He's a real peach, ain't he?

22:51.079 --> 22:52.622
Can we be done
playing spy now?

22:52.789 --> 22:54.332
Almost.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.292
He goes home every day
for lunch.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.002
Come on.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.009
- Here, put this on.
- What is it?

23:20.817 --> 23:22.819
Pardon me.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.198
Oh, God!

23:27.365 --> 23:28.658
Stop!

23:28.825 --> 23:31.702
Here, take it.
It's all I've got.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.998
- Take it. Take it.
- Whoo!

23:36.165 --> 23:38.418
Oh, God.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.713
Whoa, this is you, Ron?

23:42.880 --> 23:44.632
God.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.552
- Please, just take what--
- No. No.

23:47.718 --> 23:50.096
No,Ron.
I'm talking now.

23:50.263 --> 23:51.973
You are listening.

23:52.140 --> 23:56.644
Oh, this isn't your address,
but we already knew that.

23:56.811 --> 23:59.230
You see,
we've been watching you

23:59.397 --> 24:01.190
and we're gonna
keep watching you.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.484
And if we see anything
we don't like,

24:03.651 --> 24:06.320
we're gonna pay you a visit.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.656
Do you understand, Ron?

24:08.823 --> 24:12.034
- Please, just--
- Do you understand, Ron?!

24:12.201 --> 24:15.371
Just say it. I can't talk.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.123
Just say it.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.541
I understand.
Please, just don't--

24:18.708 --> 24:19.917
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.879
Listening again.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.298
Go to the cops,
we'll find you.

24:25.465 --> 24:27.592
Harass anyone,
eyeball anyone,

24:27.758 --> 24:31.929
so much as make one woman
feel slightly uncomfortable,

24:32.096 --> 24:34.724
and we're gonna
make you regret it.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.852
You are a piece of shit, Ron.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.021
Quit being a piece of shit.

24:40.188 --> 24:43.399
And if you don't,
you will pay.

24:43.566 --> 24:44.567
Ow.

24:44.734 --> 24:48.571
You believe me,
don't you, Ron?

24:48.738 --> 24:50.031
Yeah.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.992
Good.
Now, last thing,

24:53.159 --> 24:54.994
since I can't
have you following me.

25:03.628 --> 25:05.880
Whoops. Wink.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.798
Whoo-hoo.

25:14.222 --> 25:16.432
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

25:16.599 --> 25:19.268
Can you believe that shit?
Whoo!

25:20.895 --> 25:22.438
What did you do,
you crazy bitch?

25:22.605 --> 25:25.274
Holy crap. Holy crap.
Holy crap, I'm shaking.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.443
My God! Why didn't you tell me
what you were doing.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.237
I was afraid
you'd talk me out of it.

25:29.403 --> 25:30.947
I would have.
What the hell?

25:31.113 --> 25:34.116
Holy crap!
I can't believe we actually did it.

25:35.618 --> 25:37.078
You conked him
on the head. A lot.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.497
- You could have killed him.
- I was trying to knock him out.

25:39.664 --> 25:42.250
Yeah, but you just kept
whacking him on the head.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.628
He's probably
got a concussion.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.588
I'm sorry, this isn't funny.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.632
This is not funny.

25:49.799 --> 25:52.385
Screw that piece of shit.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.845
Score one for Cassie.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.142
Let's go.

26:00.309 --> 26:03.062
Ron's buying lunch.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.555
It's not like he admitted anything,

26:37.722 --> 26:40.266
but I don't know.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.476
It is different.

26:42.643 --> 26:45.521
It meant a lot when he said it,
you know?

26:45.688 --> 26:48.399
Even not saying
what he's sorry for.

26:48.566 --> 26:51.861
Then he's been,
I don't know, different.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.447
Nicer.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.870
I don't know
what happened to him,

27:01.037 --> 27:02.538
but I hope he doesn't
bump his head again

27:02.705 --> 27:04.165
and go back to how things were.

27:04.332 --> 27:07.209
At least now you know.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.589
He gets out of line again,
you just whack him in the head.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.887
I think we're all here
to get away from violence,

27:18.054 --> 27:20.056
don't you think, Marla?

27:20.222 --> 27:22.767
No, Lynny-Lynne-Lynne.
No, I don't think that.

27:22.933 --> 27:25.227
In fact, I think the exact
opposite of that.

27:25.394 --> 27:29.649
Maybe it's time this group of bitches
started getting a little of their own.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.492
Hey, where you going?

27:39.659 --> 27:42.787
- I got to meet somebody.
- I thought we'd celebrate.

27:42.953 --> 27:44.830
Can you believe it?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.916
What?

27:47.083 --> 27:50.002
Cassie and Ron.
I mean, it actually worked.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.254
Yeah. I got to go.

27:53.464 --> 27:54.965
Are you okay?

27:55.132 --> 27:58.719
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:58.886 --> 28:02.431
Just ex-boyfriend shit.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.975
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

28:05.142 --> 28:08.979
He's just got some stuff
of mine I've been trying to get back.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.356
I should go with you.

28:10.523 --> 28:12.733
No, it's complicated.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.528
There's a restraining
order involved,

28:15.695 --> 28:19.782
so I kind of have to go
through channels, you know?

28:19.949 --> 28:22.827
Look, I'll meet you Thursday
before group.

28:22.993 --> 28:25.579
- For coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.790
See you at Monty's.

28:39.135 --> 28:42.221
Hey there. Hey.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.306
Sorry to intrude.

28:44.473 --> 28:48.310
I'm going down to Pits
with Gloria and Saperstein

28:48.477 --> 28:50.563
for some drinks
if you'd like to come.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.148
It's not a date.

28:52.314 --> 28:55.025
It's just coworkers
going out for a beer.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.028
Actually, I tried
to get Gloria to ask you,

28:58.195 --> 29:01.532
but she's--
she's kind of scared of you.

29:01.699 --> 29:04.452
- Scared of me?
- She's sensitive, you know?

29:04.618 --> 29:07.621
- And I'm a bitch.
- Oh, no, no. I didn't say that.

29:07.788 --> 29:10.374
No, I've been mean.
I'm sorry.

29:10.541 --> 29:14.336
Look, I'm meeting
a friend tonight.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.172
I completely get it. No.

29:16.338 --> 29:19.258
But, hey,
ask me again sometime.

29:19.425 --> 29:20.926
I will. I will.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.303
Or have Gloria do it.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.805
I'll try not to be
so terrifying.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.558
Sure. Have a good night.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.021
 Hey!

29:32.188 --> 29:34.065
- How you doing?
-Over here. Come over here.

29:54.043 --> 29:55.878
- Thanks.
- Sure.

30:10.392 --> 30:13.187
Angela, I'm so sorry.

30:13.354 --> 30:16.273
Oh, it's just terrible.
I'm so sorry.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.983
What's going on?

30:18.150 --> 30:20.945
You-- you don't know?

30:22.571 --> 30:24.907
I'm afraid that I don't
have good tidings.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.951
The worst, in fact.

30:27.117 --> 30:28.702
And I want you
to prepare yourself.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.329
What?

30:30.496 --> 30:33.040
It's Marla.

30:34.416 --> 30:35.918
I don't know how else
to say this.

30:36.085 --> 30:38.963
Our dear friend Marla Finch

30:39.129 --> 30:40.881
has passed.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.800
Has passed?

30:42.967 --> 30:44.510
I know.
I know it's hard.

30:44.677 --> 30:48.138
She's passed on.
She's-- she's crossed over.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.974
What the fuck
are you talking about?

30:50.140 --> 30:53.060
Anger is a very normal reaction.

30:53.227 --> 30:55.271
A normal reaction to what?

30:55.437 --> 30:57.106
What are you
telling me, Lynne?

30:57.273 --> 30:58.816
- Are you telling me that Marla's dead?
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

30:58.983 --> 31:01.777
Stop fucking saying that
and tell me what happened.

31:01.944 --> 31:04.655
Angela, I am sorry.
I don't know.

31:04.822 --> 31:07.324
I was contacted
by a police detective this afternoon.

31:07.491 --> 31:10.202
He told me that Marla
had been found dead

31:10.369 --> 31:13.831
and that he needed to come here
to speak to the group tonight.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.293
- How did she die?
- I don't know.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.128
I'm sorry, I don't know.

31:22.298 --> 31:23.632
I know it's a terrible shock.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.427
I think that we need
to be here for each other.

31:26.594 --> 31:30.598
This is a safe place
where we can feel and react

31:30.764 --> 31:33.058
and start the mourning
process together.

31:45.738 --> 31:47.156
You bitch.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.414
I'm sorry, Angela.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.211
Oh.

32:01.378 --> 32:02.588
I think that's him.

32:02.755 --> 32:06.008
Sweetheart,
can I get you anything?

32:10.012 --> 32:11.388
Something to vomit in.

32:16.352 --> 32:17.895
Everyone.

32:18.062 --> 32:20.397
This is Detective McDylan.

32:20.564 --> 32:23.317
He's here from
the police department.

32:23.484 --> 32:25.861
Please sit down.

32:26.028 --> 32:27.780
Ahem. Should I--

32:27.947 --> 32:29.531
Yes, please.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.328
Ahem.
Uh, hi, everyone.

32:34.495 --> 32:36.163
First of all,
I really appreciate you

32:36.330 --> 32:38.040
letting me come and talk
to the group tonight.

32:38.207 --> 32:40.793
As most of you are already aware,

32:40.960 --> 32:43.712
early this morning we did discover
the body of Miss Finch.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.382
Now this is a homicide
investigation.

32:46.548 --> 32:49.551
I myself,
I'm actually with SVU.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.845
A special victims unit
often assists--

32:52.012 --> 32:54.348
I thought SVU
dealt with rape crimes.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.600
Well, we do deal
with assaults, yes.

32:56.767 --> 33:00.062
But SVU also assists
in homicide investigations

33:00.229 --> 33:01.397
when there's issues of abuse.

33:01.563 --> 33:03.065
Was she raped?

33:07.027 --> 33:10.114
Oscar.
You're Oscar Kosca, right?

33:10.280 --> 33:13.492
My name is "Koza."
Mr. Kosca.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.286
Now, I don't mean to offend
you, Officer McDylan.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.622
- It's Detective.
- Okay, Detective.

33:18.789 --> 33:21.500
This is a sacred circle.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.960
It's a place of trust
and I don't think

33:23.127 --> 33:24.420
it's an appropriate venue

33:24.586 --> 33:26.755
for you to be doing
your-- your--

33:26.922 --> 33:28.841
whatever the hell
it is that you're doing right now.

33:29.008 --> 33:33.095
Oscar, Detective McDylan
is an invited guest.

33:33.262 --> 33:36.515
Well, I most certainly
did not invite him here, Lynne.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.183
And I would not
have invited him here.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.185
And I think it was a big mistake
for you to do so.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.687
- Okay--
- I have the floor, sir.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.772
- I have the floor.
- Okay, okay.

33:43.939 --> 33:47.234
See? This is--
this is exactly what I was afraid of.

33:47.401 --> 33:48.861
The police,
they don't care about us.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.446
They don't care
about the victims.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.031
These guys
with their investigations.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.158
All they want to do
is document things.

33:54.324 --> 33:56.452
They want to dot their ls
and cross their Ts.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.370
You know, our friend
is dead, sir.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.456
And while you're doing
your stupid paperwork,

34:00.622 --> 34:02.249
- a beautiful girl is dead.
Oscar!

34:04.877 --> 34:07.588
Oh, my goodness.

34:07.755 --> 34:09.922
That's okay.
That's okay.

34:10.090 --> 34:13.802
It's okay.
Um, look, guys,

34:13.969 --> 34:17.014
all I'm trying to do here
is just figure out her whereabouts

34:17.181 --> 34:18.681
in the past 48 hours.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.935
So anything you can think of
that might be helpful,

34:22.101 --> 34:24.813
I'd really appreciate it.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.149
Just anything at all.

34:29.109 --> 34:30.819
Okay, tell you what.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.071
I'm gonna go get
a cup of coffee

34:32.237 --> 34:33.822
and I'm gonna hang around
for a little bit,

34:33.989 --> 34:36.324
and if you can think of anything,
please don't hesitate.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.786
I'll be right over there, okay?

34:38.952 --> 34:41.371
Thank you for your time.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.686
Sorry about Oscar.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.522
He's a bit high-strung.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.732
Yeah, he seems that way.

35:08.899 --> 35:11.235
His daughter was raped.

35:11.401 --> 35:13.695
Then the guy who did it
got off on a technicality.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.656
She killed herself.

35:15.823 --> 35:17.825
So he's earned his distrust
of the police.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.743
Jesus.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.496
Can you tell me
what happened to Marla?

35:24.998 --> 35:27.000
- Um...
- She was a friend of mine.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.712
I'm sorry for your loss.

35:32.214 --> 35:35.300
- Maybe I can help you.
- Yes, absolutely.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.387
If you can think
of anything suspicious

35:38.554 --> 35:41.515
or anybody who maybe had
any kind of problem with her.

35:41.682 --> 35:44.101
- Anything at all.
- So she was definitely murdered?

35:44.268 --> 35:46.687
Unfortunately, yeah.
Yeah, she was.

35:46.854 --> 35:48.605
Was she assaulted?

35:48.772 --> 35:52.401
I can't really discuss
specifics of the case.

35:52.568 --> 35:53.986
It was her ex-boyfriend,
wasn't it?

35:59.867 --> 36:03.287
Would you let me buy you
a decent cup of coffee somewhere?

36:08.625 --> 36:10.752
Sure, yeah.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.588
I know a place.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.673
Great.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.429
Well, it doesn't make sense.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.807
She knew better
than to put herself at risk.

36:23.974 --> 36:26.435
People do stupid shit.

36:26.602 --> 36:28.478
You know,
even the smart ones.

36:28.645 --> 36:32.107
I can't tell you how many times
strong-seeming women

36:32.274 --> 36:35.110
refuse to press charges
when their boyfriend or husband

36:35.277 --> 36:36.612
smacked them around
or worse.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.822
And you're right,
it doesn't make sense.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.283
She was smarter than that,
I'm telling you.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.912
She would not have put herself
in some kind of a situation

36:45.078 --> 36:46.788
with somebody who could hurt--

36:49.333 --> 36:50.709
What?

36:52.586 --> 36:54.296
Hey, what is it?

36:54.463 --> 36:56.506
If you know something,
you should tell me.

36:56.673 --> 36:59.968
Uh, it's nothing.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.678
No, no, hey.

37:05.307 --> 37:06.850
You should tell me.

37:07.017 --> 37:09.269
I think you want
to tell me, so...

37:13.023 --> 37:16.818
She was a strong girl.
Hard.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.570
You think maybe
she was into weird shit,

37:18.737 --> 37:20.781
like, I don't know,
rough sex?

37:20.948 --> 37:22.199
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.409
Okay.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.414
- You guys were close?
- Yeah.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.086
I mean, I don't know.

37:35.462 --> 37:36.922
I liked her.

37:37.089 --> 37:40.300
But I only knew her
a few weeks.

37:44.137 --> 37:45.514
We used to come here.

37:47.808 --> 37:49.768
She made me feel strong.

37:55.399 --> 37:58.402
- What?
- Nothing, I just--

37:58.568 --> 38:00.237
I see this stuff all the time.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.531
You know,
it's the strongest-seeming people,

38:02.698 --> 38:04.533
the rock everyone leans on,
but at home...

38:04.700 --> 38:07.536
No, she was strong.

38:07.703 --> 38:09.079
She did not take any shit.

38:09.246 --> 38:10.580
Except from
her ex-boyfriend, right?

38:10.747 --> 38:13.041
No, he attacked her
and she left.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.209
Yeah, the last time.

38:14.376 --> 38:17.045
But there are a ton
of domestic abuse calls on her file.

38:17.212 --> 38:18.880
And again,
I didn't know your friend,

38:19.047 --> 38:21.675
but, like I said,
I see it all the time.

38:21.842 --> 38:23.719
These guys, they have a way
of getting under a girl's skin

38:23.885 --> 38:27.180
and they can't shake 'em.

38:27.347 --> 38:30.100
This guy is a real
piece of shit, though.

38:30.267 --> 38:33.061
And I'll tell you something,
I'd be very surprised if it wasn't him.

38:35.689 --> 38:39.276
I'm sorry, I'm--
I shouldn't--

38:39.443 --> 38:42.195
I can't really discuss any details.
You understand?

38:44.406 --> 38:47.409
Listen, thank you so much
for taking the time to talk to me.

38:47.576 --> 38:51.204
I appreciate it, and I'm really
sorry about your friend, I am.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.540
I will do everything I can
to bring her some justice.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.208
I promise you.

38:59.129 --> 39:01.506
Thanks.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.217
McDylan.

39:04.384 --> 39:07.804
You don't bring her justice.
You bring it to him.

39:23.779 --> 39:25.489
It's sweet, yo.

39:25.655 --> 39:28.283
That's how it's gonna be.

39:30.118 --> 39:33.121
Well, if it isn't my favorite
damsel in distress.

39:33.288 --> 39:36.249
Where's your dyke
in shining armor tonight?

39:36.416 --> 39:39.044
What's the matter, sweetie?
She leave you for a real man?

39:39.211 --> 39:41.129
Don't worry,
I got what you need.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.674
Chief will take care of you.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.843
You don't need
that dyke bitch.

40:01.108 --> 40:06.029
What?
Thinking about it, baby?

40:09.783 --> 40:10.992
We got her all scared.

40:11.159 --> 40:14.788
I don't know if she was weak
and just very good at hiding it

40:14.955 --> 40:18.875
or if she was outmaneuvered.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.669
That's an interesting
choice of word.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.087
What do you mean by that?

40:24.214 --> 40:26.716
Just that maybe things
didn't go as she planned.

40:26.883 --> 40:29.594
Well, what do you think
she had planned?

40:31.680 --> 40:33.807
I don't know.

40:33.974 --> 40:35.976
Not being dead.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.771
She wasn't weak.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.316
A history of abuse doesn't mean
she was some fucking loser

40:43.483 --> 40:44.943
who brought it on herself.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.654
Then what do you
think it means?

41:00.667 --> 41:01.877
Hey!

41:02.043 --> 41:04.504
Why the fuck are you
always lurking out here?

41:04.671 --> 41:06.882
I'm just walking to my desk.
What's the matter?

41:07.048 --> 41:08.967
Nothing.

41:11.178 --> 41:12.262
Wow.

41:24.191 --> 41:27.068
He walked?
How is it that he walked?

41:27.235 --> 41:29.362
He's fucking guilty.
You said so yourself.

41:29.529 --> 41:32.616
Okay, okay, listen.
I'm really sorry, okay?

41:32.782 --> 41:34.159
These things are complicated

41:34.326 --> 41:36.161
and unfortunately the good guys
don't always get to win.

41:36.328 --> 41:37.996
Who are the good guys?
You?

41:38.163 --> 41:40.373
I'm not a lawyer.
I'm not the DA.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.584
So it's her own fault
she was killed

41:42.751 --> 41:44.794
because she was weak
or scared or stupid?

41:44.961 --> 41:46.463
I don't know what happened.
I don't.

41:46.630 --> 41:48.256
I am truly sorry, okay?

41:48.423 --> 41:50.175
I know there's nothing I can say
to make that any better.

41:50.342 --> 41:53.803
I don't want you to say something.
I want you to do something.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.597
Look, what can I do, Angela?

41:55.764 --> 41:57.933
There is a system
in place, okay?

41:58.099 --> 41:59.684
And most of the time
it actually works.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.437
For who?
Not for rape victims.

42:02.604 --> 42:04.397
Not for my dead friend Marla.

42:04.564 --> 42:07.776
Listen, you think he did it.
I think he did it.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.569
But there is a burden
of proof here.

42:09.736 --> 42:11.363
And you want that,
do you understand?

42:11.530 --> 42:13.031
Otherwise someone could just
point their finger at you

42:13.198 --> 42:14.449
and send you to jail
because they feel like it.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.201
- He's guilty.
- What do you want me to say?

42:16.368 --> 42:18.954
- They didn't fucking prove it.
- You didn't fucking prove it.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.497
Okay, I didn't prove it.

42:20.664 --> 42:23.917
He rapes and murders my friend
and you just let him walk away.

42:24.084 --> 42:25.752
Not wearing a cape
and a utility belt.

42:25.919 --> 42:28.004
I'm a cop.
I did my job.

42:28.171 --> 42:29.798
It's not all up to me.

42:29.965 --> 42:33.134
Yeah?
Well, keep up the good work.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.347
Angela.

42:37.514 --> 42:39.140
Angela!

43:51.421 --> 43:52.922
Deep!

43:53.089 --> 43:55.383
Deep, deep, deep, deep!

44:03.350 --> 44:06.019
Where's all the hot girls
up in this joint, man?

44:06.186 --> 44:08.229
There's a handful.

44:30.752 --> 44:33.088
Hey.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.256
Where you going?

44:35.423 --> 44:37.509
Hey, come on.
Slow down.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.142
What do you want?

44:46.309 --> 44:48.228
I saw you looking at me.

44:48.395 --> 44:50.647
So?
I look at a lot of people.

44:50.814 --> 44:52.982
I know you're interested.

44:53.149 --> 44:56.653
I'm not interested.
I want to be very clear with you.

44:56.820 --> 44:58.863
I don't want your attention.

44:59.030 --> 45:02.075
I want you to walk away
and leave me alone.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.162
Hey, come on.

45:06.329 --> 45:08.415
Yeah.

45:08.581 --> 45:09.916
No.

45:10.083 --> 45:13.086
I said no.

45:14.587 --> 45:16.798
Come on.
You know you want to feel it.

45:18.007 --> 45:20.385
What, your pathetic little
excuse for a cock?

45:20.552 --> 45:22.721
I thought that
was your clitoris.

45:28.643 --> 45:31.354
Is that all you got, pussy?

45:35.900 --> 45:38.570
- You hit like a girl.
- Yeah?

45:41.030 --> 45:43.742
You think you're funny,
you prick-tease cunt?

45:45.160 --> 45:48.246
Come on now, smart mouth,
do something useful with it.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.169
You know you like it rough.

46:00.216 --> 46:02.302
No teeth,
show-horse.

46:02.469 --> 46:04.512
No teeth.

46:11.978 --> 46:14.898
That's it.
Not just the tip, sweetie.

46:37.086 --> 46:40.048
Just the tip, sweetie.

47:03.655 --> 47:06.866
This is for Marla,
show-horse.

47:18.253 --> 47:21.339
It's like a switch gets thrown.
It just comes out in a rush.

47:21.506 --> 47:22.799
And what is it that makes
you so angry?

47:22.966 --> 47:24.676
Because it just keeps happening.

47:24.843 --> 47:27.512
People are such animals.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.389
Only they're even worse

47:29.556 --> 47:31.766
because an animal doesn't relish
in the pain it causes.

47:31.933 --> 47:35.645
An animal doesn't get sadistic
pleasure from torturing others.

47:35.812 --> 47:38.565
- Only humans are that cruel.
- You're human.

47:38.731 --> 47:41.901
Do you get sadistic pleasure
from committing acts of cruelty?

47:42.068 --> 47:44.028
Fuck yeah, I do.

47:45.446 --> 47:47.240
Sometimes.

47:47.407 --> 47:50.201
Yo, Angela. Angela.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.412
There's a detective
here to see you.

47:57.458 --> 47:59.794
- Is everything okay?
- No.

48:06.175 --> 48:08.887
I've really got a lot of work to do.
Can we play cops and robbers later?

48:09.053 --> 48:10.471
Where were you
on Tuesday night?

48:10.638 --> 48:13.266
Is this official police business
or are you stalking me?

48:13.433 --> 48:16.102
Marla's ex-boyfriend
was murdered on Tuesday.

48:16.269 --> 48:18.771
Somebody beat him to death
with a crowbar,

48:18.938 --> 48:20.189
amongst other things.

48:31.034 --> 48:34.787
So what are you saying?
You think I did it?

48:34.954 --> 48:37.498
No, no.

48:37.665 --> 48:39.167
But Bolton's definitely
gonna want to talk to you.

48:39.334 --> 48:41.002
- Who's Bolton?
- Lead homicide.

48:41.169 --> 48:44.130
- It's her investigation.
- What do I have to do with anything?

48:44.297 --> 48:46.799
Well, you did come on pretty strong
when he got out, right? So...

48:46.966 --> 48:48.593
So now I'm a murder suspect?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.678
She's gonna want to talk
to all Marla's friends.

48:50.845 --> 48:53.306
I barely knew her.

48:53.473 --> 48:55.600
Well, she didn't have very many
friends outside of group, so...

48:55.767 --> 48:57.060
She didn't have
any friends in group.

48:57.226 --> 48:59.604
- She hated everybody.
- Except you.

49:01.689 --> 49:03.358
Look, you said yourself
that this guy is a scumbag.

49:03.524 --> 49:05.485
I mean, maybe it has nothing
to do with Marla at all.

49:05.652 --> 49:07.862
No, the nature of the crime
suggests otherwise.

49:08.029 --> 49:11.032
So what?
I mean, he was murdered.

49:11.199 --> 49:13.576
So was my friend.
And if there's no justice for her,

49:13.743 --> 49:15.036
then why should there
be any for him?

49:15.203 --> 49:16.663
He was a piece of shit.

49:16.829 --> 49:18.706
And to be honest,
I'm glad that somebody killed him.

49:18.873 --> 49:21.751
Well, that's exactly what you don't
want to say in this situation, okay?

49:21.918 --> 49:24.837
God damn it, you're more interested
in catching his killer

49:25.004 --> 49:26.172
than you are in punishing hers.

49:26.339 --> 49:28.132
Listen, you have
to calm down, okay?

49:28.299 --> 49:31.135
Or Bolton is gonna have
a field day with you, trust me.

49:32.720 --> 49:33.972
Okay?

49:36.391 --> 49:38.810
Thank you for telling me.
I appreciate it.

49:38.977 --> 49:40.353
But, you know,
if I'm not under arrest,

49:40.520 --> 49:42.563
then I really need to get back
to my shitty job.

49:42.730 --> 49:46.192
Hey, Angela, look.

49:46.359 --> 49:49.195
For what it's worth, I am sorry
you're mixed up in all of this, okay?

49:49.362 --> 49:52.073
You should really leave
the murder investigations

49:52.240 --> 49:54.200
to the homicide detectives.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.210
I can't go back there.

50:04.377 --> 50:07.338
I don't know where to go.

50:07.505 --> 50:09.549
I don't know what to do, but...

50:13.261 --> 50:15.096
I can't take it anymore.

50:15.263 --> 50:18.766
You know, she pretends
like she can't hear it, but...

50:21.310 --> 50:23.354
it hurts.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.982
He really hurts me.

50:26.149 --> 50:28.609
And...

50:28.776 --> 50:31.487
I think he likes it.

50:31.654 --> 50:33.781
Enough, enough, stop.

50:36.200 --> 50:39.495
Cassie, I'm sorry.
I just-- I can't listen to this anymore.

50:39.662 --> 50:41.122
It's too awful.

50:41.289 --> 50:43.708
It's got to stop!

50:43.875 --> 50:45.293
Somebody--

50:45.460 --> 50:49.422
somebody needs
to stop this horrific man.

50:49.589 --> 50:52.592
He must be stopped
and he must be punished.

50:52.759 --> 50:56.345
Truly punished.
No. No, Lynne, no.

50:56.512 --> 51:00.141
Someone should hurt him.
He should hurt.

51:00.308 --> 51:02.143
He should--

51:02.310 --> 51:06.147
he should be anally violated
with a metal pipe.

51:06.314 --> 51:09.567
No, somebody
should do something.

51:09.734 --> 51:11.903
Somebody
should do something!

51:39.472 --> 51:40.807
Sorry, we're closed
for the night.

51:40.973 --> 51:42.517
Very sorry.

51:42.683 --> 51:44.352
I hate to bother you,

51:44.519 --> 51:47.146
but I've been back and forth
like three times

51:47.313 --> 51:49.023
and I just can't
find this address.

51:49.190 --> 51:50.566
The buildings
don't have numbers.

51:50.733 --> 51:52.777
Yeah, yeah,
it's tricky around here.

51:52.944 --> 51:55.530
Sweetie, this is--
this is close.

51:55.696 --> 51:56.864
It's just a few blocks that way.

51:57.031 --> 51:59.826
That's what I thought,
but I just keep going back and forth.

51:59.992 --> 52:01.536
You know, this isn't
the best neighborhood

52:01.702 --> 52:03.663
and this isn't far.

52:03.830 --> 52:05.623
What if I walk you?

52:05.790 --> 52:07.041
That would be great.

52:07.208 --> 52:09.502
Okay? Okay-

52:09.669 --> 52:11.587
Let's go.

52:15.633 --> 52:19.637
Well, this is the address.

52:19.804 --> 52:22.306
I don't like the looks of it.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.767
Me neither.

52:24.934 --> 52:26.519
Maybe I should
come in with you.

52:30.314 --> 52:32.108
Hello.

52:43.035 --> 52:44.745
Weird place.

52:44.912 --> 52:47.165
- I like it.
- Yeah?

52:47.331 --> 52:49.709
Want to play?

52:51.252 --> 52:52.837
What's the matter?

52:53.004 --> 52:54.797
You don't like me, Daddy?

52:56.299 --> 52:58.593
Oh, no,
I like you just fine.

52:59.886 --> 53:03.890
I'm not too grown up,
am I, Daddy?

53:08.436 --> 53:11.147
I'm a bad little girl.

53:13.941 --> 53:15.943
Daddy.

53:26.621 --> 53:29.457
Sure you can get it up
for someone over 17?

53:30.791 --> 53:33.044
We told you
we'd be watching.

53:46.599 --> 53:48.142
What?

53:50.186 --> 53:52.730
Help. Help!

53:55.066 --> 53:58.361
Please, somebody help me!

53:58.527 --> 54:01.656
God! Help!

54:05.826 --> 54:07.286
You're awake.

54:07.453 --> 54:08.871
Who are you?

54:09.038 --> 54:11.791
What are you--
what are you doing?

54:13.334 --> 54:17.421
Come on, let me out of this chair,
you fucking bitch.

54:17.588 --> 54:20.216
God damn it,
get me out of this chair.

54:21.717 --> 54:24.512
What--
what is that?

54:24.679 --> 54:27.515
What are you--
what are you gonna do with that?

54:29.225 --> 54:31.644
I'm gonna educate you with it.

54:33.104 --> 54:35.022
You should know
how it feels to be raped

54:35.189 --> 54:37.608
over and over again.

54:37.775 --> 54:40.069
I didn't do anything to Cassie.

54:40.236 --> 54:42.905
Cassie?

54:45.700 --> 54:47.868
I didn't say a name.

54:48.035 --> 54:51.080
Is there something
you want to tell me?

54:54.333 --> 54:56.002
She--

54:56.168 --> 54:58.462
we had trouble,
she and I, but it--

54:59.964 --> 55:01.173
it's better now.

55:06.512 --> 55:08.889
Did you pose for Cassie?

55:10.933 --> 55:12.768
Please.

55:12.935 --> 55:15.354
Do what you made Cassie do.

55:15.521 --> 55:17.648
Come on.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.233
Pucker up.

55:29.952 --> 55:32.038
You suck at oral, Ron.

55:39.754 --> 55:41.672
Oh, God.

55:41.839 --> 55:43.424
Oh, God.

55:43.591 --> 55:45.092
Please.

55:45.259 --> 55:47.845
Please, I need a doctor.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.765
Not for very much longer.

55:50.931 --> 55:53.601
I'm sorry.

55:53.768 --> 55:57.438
I have a--
God, I have a family.

56:03.694 --> 56:06.739
Don't you dare try
and use that.

56:10.368 --> 56:11.952
Please.

56:12.119 --> 56:13.871
I'm begging you.

56:14.038 --> 56:17.333
I'm-- I'm sorry!

56:17.500 --> 56:19.627
Yes, you will be.

56:25.508 --> 56:27.551
You don't deserve
the lubricant,

56:27.718 --> 56:28.969
but it just won't
go in otherwise.

56:29.136 --> 56:31.347
Oh, God, please don't.
Please.

56:31.514 --> 56:34.266
Please don't. Please, please.
I'll do anything you want.

56:34.433 --> 56:37.561
Please, just tell me what
you want me to do.

56:37.728 --> 56:40.106
That's a tough one, Ron.

56:40.272 --> 56:44.777
'Cause what I want
you to do is suffer.

56:44.944 --> 56:47.613
Oh, no!
I'm begging you.

56:47.780 --> 56:50.116
I'm-- oh! Oh!
Oh, God!

56:58.457 --> 57:00.084
Oh, God!

57:10.052 --> 57:12.263
Oh, take it out!
Take it out!

57:12.430 --> 57:14.640
Take it out, please!
Please, please take it--

57:14.807 --> 57:18.144
Out?
It's barely even in there.

57:21.105 --> 57:23.107
We have a long ways to go.

57:29.697 --> 57:31.782
No! No!

57:31.949 --> 57:34.702
- Oh, God!
- Hold still.

57:34.869 --> 57:37.204
Oh, fuck.

57:37.371 --> 57:39.373
It's hard to hit
when it's wiggling like that.

57:39.540 --> 57:41.083
No, no, no,

58:37.932 --> 58:39.600
Forgive me, Father,

58:39.767 --> 58:42.269
for I don't give a shit.

58:46.023 --> 58:48.317
Do you even want forgiveness?

58:49.985 --> 58:52.988
Only people who are sorry
can be forgiven.

58:53.155 --> 58:54.740
Are you sorry?

58:57.618 --> 59:00.788
Don't you think that if you
get even with somebody,

59:00.955 --> 59:04.041
then they have to get even with you
and the problem perpetuates itself?

59:04.208 --> 59:05.292
Not always.

59:05.459 --> 59:06.877
Like when?

59:09.630 --> 59:11.757
Do you have any remorse
for what you've done?

59:11.924 --> 59:14.843
Why should I?

59:15.010 --> 59:19.557
Have you considered that
forgiveness might be a way

59:19.723 --> 59:22.184
for you to release some of the anger
that you've been carrying around?

59:22.351 --> 59:24.395
So am I forgiven?

59:24.562 --> 59:26.981
Do you forgive yourself?

59:29.149 --> 59:32.111
You're not responsible
for what happened to you.

59:32.278 --> 59:36.156
Some people do bad things.
They make bad decisions.

59:36.323 --> 59:38.325
Maybe somebody
did bad things to them.

59:38.492 --> 59:40.995
But the only way out
is forgiveness.

59:41.161 --> 59:42.997
I'll never forgive them.

59:43.163 --> 59:45.499
They deserved
to be punished.

59:45.666 --> 59:48.377
But does that really help
you heal?

59:48.544 --> 59:52.256
Maybe not, but at least they got
what they deserved.

59:53.882 --> 59:56.510
Do you think you
deserve to be punished?

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.855
Should we wait for Lynne
or just start without her?

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:17.281
Everyone, I'm sorry
for the intrusion,

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:18.907
but this is the police.

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:20.451
You don't say.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.624
I'm Detective Glenn Bolton.
This is Homer,

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.251
and McDylan I guess
you've already all met.

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:31.337
We'd like to ask you
all some questions.

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:33.422
Jesus.

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:43.432
You must be Mr. Kosca.

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:46.769
It's pronounced "Koza."

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:50.230
Why don't we start with you?

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:53.692
Can we get a couple chairs?
Just set them aside

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:56.945
so we can speak
to Mr. Kosca.

01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:59.531
"Koza."

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:02.660
And if this has anything
to do with Marla Finch,

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:04.578
I hardly knew the woman, okay?

01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:06.330
So why don't you just leave
me out of this?

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:09.750
- You know Ron Merrick?
- I most certainly do not.

01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:13.379
Oh, I think you do.
You threatened him the other night.

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:16.340
- I did no such thing.
- Right here in group.

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:18.759
Something about a pipe.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:24.598
Mmm, does that ring any bells,
Mr. Kosca?

01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:27.559
- "Koza!" It's "Koza."
Oscar.

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:31.855
Hey, remember me?
I'm Detective McDylan.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.942
I'm not delusional, Detective.
I know who you are.

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:37.736
- You don't have to handle me.
- Okay, what about Cassie?

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:39.446
You remember Cassie
from group here?

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:43.450
Huh? Cassie's stepfather
Ron Merrick was murdered.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.828
Now that's three murders
with ties to this group.

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.747
Marla, her ex-boyfriend,
and now Cassie's step--

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:52.501
I didn't--
come-- guys, come on.

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:57.131
I come to group because it's supposed
to be a safe place to share things.

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:59.842
Hey, listen, all we're asking

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:02.428
is that you consider us
just new members of the group.

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:03.971
Just for tonight, okay?

01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:06.265
Maybe we can find out something
that might be helpful.

01:02:06.432 --> 01:02:08.976
We might not find anything,
but we'll never know if we don't ask.

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:10.811
All right?

01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:13.480
Now that's three murders, guys.
We have to be here.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:16.400
We have to talk to everybody.
You understand that, right?

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:18.485
I mean, you'd want that.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:20.696
You don't want us
to make any mistakes.

01:02:20.863 --> 01:02:22.656
Right?

01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:24.992
You prick.
How dare you?

01:02:25.159 --> 01:02:28.704
Now? Now you're supposed
to be all caring for us?

01:02:28.871 --> 01:02:29.955
You know what?

01:02:30.122 --> 01:02:34.168
I think we'll have a little more
privacy down at the station.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:39.339
You can share with all of us
downtown, Mr. Kosca.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:43.677
Get your hands off.
Get your hands off of me.

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:46.597
Get your hands off me!

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.775
Well, that was real subtle.
You handled that very well.

01:02:59.485 --> 01:03:02.029
- Bring 'em all in.
What?

01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:14.541
Front desk, please hold.

01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:21.215
Hey, what's going on with Oscar?

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.008
Oscar is spending
the night with us.

01:03:23.175 --> 01:03:26.261
You don't really think
he killed Cassie's step-dad.

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:28.597
He's not capable
of something like that.

01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:31.058
Well, maybe you don't know
people as well as you think you do.

01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:33.393
He's got a history of making threats,
did you know that?

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.939
The accused in his daughter's case,
the DA, the lead investigator.

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:38.899
These are the kinds of threats
people remember, too.

01:03:39.066 --> 01:03:41.109
Did he actually do any of it?

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:43.403
Has Oscar actually hurt anybody?

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:45.531
I don't know. That's what
we're trying to figure out, okay?

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:48.325
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna get back to my shitty job.

01:04:05.801 --> 01:04:07.761
Hey.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:10.180
You all right?

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:14.643
Do you want to talk about it?

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:22.442
Well, if you change your mind,
I'm a good listener.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.613
Thanks.
It's all right.

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:29.741
Okay.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:39.418
Oscar.

01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:41.128
What are you doing here?

01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:43.338
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

01:04:46.717 --> 01:04:48.927
Do you have a few minutes?

01:04:51.138 --> 01:04:53.640
I read about
your daughter's case.

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.809
They really botched it.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.230
It's bureaucracy.

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:04.067
All these functionaries

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:06.153
who only know how
to push paper around.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.822
When the facts don't match up
with the paperwork,

01:05:08.989 --> 01:05:11.158
they discount the facts.

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:15.537
They "lost" his DNA,
so he didn't rape my daughter.

01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:17.456
Yeah.

01:05:17.623 --> 01:05:20.834
I bet his high-priced lawyer
paid someone to lose it.

01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:24.796
They couldn't move
forward without it?

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:28.425
No, without physical evidence,
it's her word against his.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:31.303
And they made her out to--

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.432
to look like a slut.

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:41.438
And it devastated her.
It just ruined her.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:45.859
And all this time, knowing this guy
Watson is still out there.

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:50.656
Why are you suddenly
so interested?

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:53.659
Because I know
how your daughter felt.

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:56.370
Hopeless.

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:02.084
One of the guys who raped me
was a cop.

01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:10.550
You never talk in group.
You never say anything.

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:12.928
There were five of them.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:17.057
I thought the sheriff
would protect me.

01:06:17.224 --> 01:06:19.893
I was wrong.

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:22.938
Were they caught?

01:06:23.105 --> 01:06:26.108
They weren't arrested,
if that's what you mean.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.404
You know, you tell your kids

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.447
to trust the authorities, right?

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:35.033
Call 911, call the cops.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.912
Emma didn't want to do it.
I had to convince her to do it.

01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:40.872
I told her,
"You've got to do this.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:44.001
You've got to report this guy.
He's just gonna do it to somebody else."

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:47.087
But the day that this guy walked,

01:06:47.254 --> 01:06:51.216
I'll never forget the expression
on her face,

01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:53.635
the disappointment
that she had in me.

01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:57.305
Not in the cops,
not in the lawyers, but in me.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:00.434
Because I told her to do it.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.852
I let her down.

01:07:02.019 --> 01:07:04.271
I think justice has a way
of finding people.

01:07:04.438 --> 01:07:07.524
Yeah, well,
I've given up on justice.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:15.615
How did her rapist get
a restraining order against you?

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:19.578
I thought if he saw my face

01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:22.080
that he wouldn't forget her.

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:25.292
That maybe he would confess.

01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:28.837
He owned this gym.
That's where it happened.

01:07:29.004 --> 01:07:30.881
So I went there every day

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:33.550
and I talked to everybody
who went in and out of that place

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:36.470
and I wanted them to know
what he did.

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:37.679
So what does he do?

01:07:37.846 --> 01:07:40.057
He turns around
and he sues me for libel

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.434
and gets a restraining
order against me.

01:07:42.601 --> 01:07:46.146
He sold that gym,
but he's still a fucking trainer.

01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:48.482
Some sleazy place
on 17th Street.

01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:50.734
They made it sound
like you were dangerous.

01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:53.070
Come on, look at me.

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:56.448
Compared to Watson,
that creature.

01:07:56.615 --> 01:07:58.575
But I should have
done something.

01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:01.369
I should have done something
to make things right.

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:03.830
Even if it meant me going
to jail for the rest of my life,

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:05.999
I should have done something.

01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:09.628
 But you're not talking
about punishment,

01:08:09.795 --> 01:08:11.671
you're talking about vengeance.

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:13.757
Taking the law
into your own hands.

01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:16.051
I'd rather that
than leave it in nobody's,

01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:17.219
which is where it is now.

01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:19.095
You believe that?

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.014
Don't you?

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.309
Set aside for a moment
the countless rapists

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:25.685
who go unpunished,

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:27.979
what about people
like Cassie's mom?

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:30.232
Serving her daughter
up to a monster.

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:31.566
She gets a big pass.

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.527
She's not even in the system.

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.403
Who's gonna make her pay
for what she did?

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.029
That's not your job.

01:08:37.197 --> 01:08:39.573
Don't you think she's been affected
by her decisions?

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:41.283
No. That's bullshit.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.370
I saw her
and she looked fine to me.

01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:47.707
Everybody has their own problems,
their own destiny.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:50.919
You need to worry about
your choices and actions.

01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:53.255
I thought that was your job.

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:56.716
You know what I'm hearing?

01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:58.468
Is that after everything
you've been through,

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.970
you have essentially
learned nothing.

01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:02.973
No.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.143
I've learned a lot.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:38.610
Why are you following me?

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.371
Who hired you?

01:10:50.622 --> 01:10:52.165
Fuck you.

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:09.391
You fucked with
the wrong guy.

01:11:20.652 --> 01:11:22.404
You're not gonna like this.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.916
You fucked up,
you stupid cunt.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:09.242
This is gonna hurt a lot.

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:12.746
Police!

01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:15.915
What the fuck is this?

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.043
Get your hands on
your fucking head right now.

01:12:18.209 --> 01:12:19.419
You following me?

01:12:19.586 --> 01:12:22.005
Hands on your head,
get on the ground now.

01:12:22.172 --> 01:12:25.967
Is this cooze bait, is that it?
Entrapment.

01:12:26.134 --> 01:12:29.429
Put your hands on your head
and get on the fucking ground now.

01:12:29.596 --> 01:12:31.431
Fuck you, pig-

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:38.813
Hey, hey, he)!-

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.565
Okay, Okay-

01:12:40.732 --> 01:12:42.942
Angela,
can you hear me?

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:45.111
Okay, okay.
You're okay.

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:48.615
You're okay.
Call a fucking ambulance.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.295
You all right?
Yeah?

01:13:02.462 --> 01:13:05.298
- You up for a few questions?
- Sure.

01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:08.593
Great.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.678
Okay.

01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:12.806
Let's see.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:15.558
- The knife was yours, right?
- Yes.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.435
The Taser I'm not sure about

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:19.896
because it had your fingerprints
on it as well as his.

01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:21.898
It's mine.
I was raped.

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:23.942
Of course I don't go out
without defensive weapons.

01:13:24.109 --> 01:13:25.527
Naturally.

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:28.988
And now, why were you
in that part of town?

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:31.950
I was looking at a gym
on 17th.

01:13:32.117 --> 01:13:33.868
On 17th.

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:36.204
So you were eight blocks
north of there.

01:13:36.371 --> 01:13:39.165
I got lost going home.

01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:41.000
Thought someone
was following me.

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:42.961
Guess I panicked.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.005
Why not a gym
in your own neighborhood?

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:49.050
Can't afford it.

01:13:49.217 --> 01:13:51.845
All right, well, the gym explains
the change of clothes.

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:53.471
You found my bag, good.

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:55.473
But not the lighter fluid.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.143
I was returning it.

01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:00.770
- To whom?
- The store.

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:03.022
- It was the wrong kind.
- For what?

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:06.401
A lighter.
Started smoking again.

01:14:06.568 --> 01:14:07.694
It was used.

01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:10.530
I opened it
before I realized.

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:11.906
What store?

01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:13.700
Pharmacy on 15th.

01:14:13.867 --> 01:14:15.994
- Where was the receipt?
- In the bag.

01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:18.371
And the man?
Who was he to you?

01:14:18.538 --> 01:14:20.582
The man who attacked me.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.505
Hmm.

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:29.048
So who's the little girl
in the picture?

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.675
It's just a girl.

01:14:30.842 --> 01:14:34.179
Just a girl whose picture
you wear around your neck?

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:36.973
It reminds me of something.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.225
Oh? What?

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:41.060
Innocence.

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:43.396
You need to be
reminded of that?

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:48.234
I know who she is.

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:52.780
Chastity Storch.

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:56.409
Her father
was a Louisiana sheriff.

01:14:56.576 --> 01:14:58.119
Killed in a murder-suicide

01:14:58.286 --> 01:15:01.498
with some inbred
redneck buddies of his.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:04.709
You know,
there was one missing piece.

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:07.086
Someone the police
wanted to talk to.

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:10.423
Jennifer Hills.

01:15:15.053 --> 01:15:16.763
Why'd you change your name?

01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:19.766
I didn't want to be
Jennifer Hills anymore.

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:24.020
All right,

01:15:24.187 --> 01:15:26.564
let's just cut the shit, okay?

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:29.776
We've got you,
you understand?

01:15:29.943 --> 01:15:32.362
Do you understand?

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:38.785
See, this, all this,
it's just a process.

01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:40.787
You know, the system.

01:15:40.954 --> 01:15:43.289
But it's done.

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:46.876
We're not idiots, Ms. Hills.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:50.129
And, you know, it's actually
a very easy storyline to follow.

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:53.424
You become buddy-buddy
with Marla Finch from group

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:56.386
and, you know, yes,
that was a terrible,

01:15:56.553 --> 01:15:58.304
terrible thing
that happened to her.

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:00.056
Then the boyfriend walks

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:02.141
and you snap.

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:05.144
I understand that.
I honestly do.

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:09.607
And there are some days, whew,
I want to do the exact same thing.

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:13.278
And then that girl,
what was her name?

01:16:15.989 --> 01:16:19.075
Cassie. Jesus.

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:21.911
I can't imagine
what it was like sitting there

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:25.665
listening to that little girl
talk about being raped

01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:30.670
by her stepfather and not wanting
to shove a pipe up that guy's ass.

01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:34.966
That's actually what your buddy
Oscar suggested doing, right?

01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:37.594
That exact same thing, huh?

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.346
- You know what?
-Hmm?

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:43.057
Now that I think about it...

01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:48.229
Lynne seemed especially
upset about it all.

01:16:48.396 --> 01:16:50.023
Have you looked into
her whereabouts?

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:53.276
Yeah, well,
we didn't find Lynne

01:16:53.443 --> 01:16:56.779
in a fight to the death
with Cole Watson.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:59.949
Who's Cole Watson?

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:02.869
Man, don't kid yourself,
Jennifer.

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:06.205
We're looking at full-blown
premeditated murder.

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:07.999
That guy attacked me.

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:10.293
And if you hadn't shot him dead,
he would have killed me.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:13.379
I'm guessing they're not gonna
charge you because you're cops.

01:17:15.882 --> 01:17:17.550
That's funny.

01:17:17.717 --> 01:17:19.719
You should hold on
to your sense of humor.

01:17:19.886 --> 01:17:21.512
You're gonna need it.

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:23.556
Do I get a lawyer?

01:17:23.723 --> 01:17:27.518
Or is that just for people who you
haven't already decided are guilty?

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:33.066
She wants to make
her phone call.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:34.734
Detective McDylan...

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.157
Detective McDylan!

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:42.909
I did it.

01:17:43.076 --> 01:17:46.329
Oh, my God!
Everybody get back.

01:17:46.496 --> 01:17:48.915
- I killed them all.
- Jesus Christ.

01:17:49.082 --> 01:17:51.793
- No!
- I killed them all.

01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:53.878
- I did it.
Call an ambulance.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:58.216
Call an ambulance now!

01:17:58.383 --> 01:18:01.469
I murdered them.
I murdered them.

01:18:01.636 --> 01:18:03.638
I murdered them.

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:20.446
Hey, Angela.
I'll give you a ride.

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.323
Go fuck yourself.

01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:25.159
- I'm sorry about Oscar, okay?
- I'm sure you are.

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:27.453
Just let me give you a ride.
I'm trying to help you out here.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.288
Like you care!

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:31.541
You fuckers are no better
than the rapists.

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:32.709
Let me ask you something.

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.211
Did you spend this much time
investigating Marla's ex?

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:36.713
Or were you saving
that all for me?

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:39.716
Honestly, if I had any idea
how incompetent the police were,

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:42.677
I would have spent my life
hiding in fear.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:46.556
Angela, don't leave town.

01:18:48.474 --> 01:18:50.685
I'm serious.
You skip bail, you're fucked.

01:18:50.852 --> 01:18:52.812
I'm fucked already.

01:18:52.979 --> 01:18:54.814
So are we gonna talk about it?

01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:56.774
What's there to talk about?

01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:57.942
Are you gonna tell me

01:18:58.109 --> 01:19:00.862
that you ran into a door
or fell down the stairs?

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:02.697
Yeah.

01:19:02.864 --> 01:19:05.783
Like you want to hear
the truth.

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.535
Try me.

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:13.666
The truth is you want justice,
you take it for yourself.

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:15.960
No one can give it to you.

01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:17.670
Is that how that happened?

01:19:17.837 --> 01:19:19.422
You're damn right it is.

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:24.343
Maybe you were able
to exact some justice,

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:27.013
but it doesn't seem to have
brought you any peace.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.183
I'm not finished yet.

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:04.735
Angela.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:07.154
Man, is that you?

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:10.616
Buy me a drink.

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:13.119
I think you've already
had a few.

01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:14.954
Let me give you
a ride home.

01:21:15.121 --> 01:21:16.956
I'll bet you want
to give me a ride.

01:21:17.123 --> 01:21:19.417
I'm sorry, excuse me?

01:21:19.584 --> 01:21:22.920
You can drop the polite act.

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:26.632
Come on, Angela.
Man, let me--

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:28.384
let me just take you home.

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:30.219
I thought you wanted
to fuck me.

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:33.389
Whoa, hey, I don't--
I don't know-- what is this?

01:21:33.556 --> 01:21:35.057
What do you want it to be?

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:38.311
Angela, come on, you are completely
freaking me out right now, okay?

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:42.315
Look, I'm gonna go.
You gonna be okay if I go?

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:44.525
Do you think I need a cock
to protect me?

01:21:44.692 --> 01:21:46.193
Yo, is that a knife?

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.862
What, this?

01:21:48.029 --> 01:21:49.488
Yo.

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.490
No, what the...?

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:53.534
Angela, what is wrong
with you?

01:22:28.486 --> 01:22:30.530
Hey, honey.

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:34.533
Showing it off, huh?

01:22:36.327 --> 01:22:38.329
That's real nice.

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:42.291
Let me see
what you're working with.

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.752
Mm, such a sweet ass.

01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:47.046
Though if you're gonna
show it off like that,

01:22:47.213 --> 01:22:48.464
you ought to let me have some.

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:51.550
Is that how it works?

01:22:53.052 --> 01:22:55.346
Do I have to wear a sheet
to keep you from raping me?

01:22:55.513 --> 01:22:58.891
What the fuck?
Nobody raping anybody.

01:23:02.395 --> 01:23:05.106
Hey, what happened
to your face?

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:06.732
I fell in love.

01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:09.110
What?

01:23:09.276 --> 01:23:11.696
What's the matter?
Don't you like me anymore?

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:13.239
Bitch, you better
back the fuck up.

01:23:13.406 --> 01:23:15.074
Come on, Chief.
I thought you had something

01:23:15.241 --> 01:23:16.242
you wanted to show me.

01:23:18.536 --> 01:23:22.456
Come on, you gonna
turn down a little blow job?

01:23:24.125 --> 01:23:26.002
What? What the--
come on.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.889
You serious?

01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:41.058
Why don't you
come over here?

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:43.394
Find out for yourself,
tough guy.

01:23:45.146 --> 01:23:46.814
Wait, what?

01:23:46.981 --> 01:23:48.816
Right here in the middle
of the park?

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:53.195
It's not gonna
take that long.

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:02.038
Shit, I mean...

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:10.796
Oh, shit.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:12.965
Oh, your foreplay needs work.

01:24:14.258 --> 01:24:15.634
Hey!

01:24:17.762 --> 01:24:19.638
- Hey, hey.
- Stop right there.

01:24:19.805 --> 01:24:21.390
Okay. Okay.

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:23.934
Take one step and I'll slit
his fucking throat.

01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:27.980
Hey, Angela, put the knife down
and get off him, okay?

01:24:28.147 --> 01:24:30.066
You gonna read me
my rights?

01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:33.319
You're okay.
Just put the knife down, okay?

01:24:33.486 --> 01:24:35.196
I have the right
to remain silent.

01:24:37.448 --> 01:24:38.449
Angela.

01:24:38.616 --> 01:24:41.660
- Anything I say...
- Put the weapon down.

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:43.996
- ...can and will be...
- Angela, don't!

01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:46.832
...used against me.

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:51.462
Time's up.

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:54.131
So soon?

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:58.761
Feels like we were
just getting started.

01:24:58.928 --> 01:25:02.223
And yet it's been two years.
You're out of here Friday.

01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:05.810
How about you try
to keep out of trouble?

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:08.687
You think you can go
three days without fighting?

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:12.399
Maybe.
But if somebody steps up...

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:15.528
Well, you have a choice
in how you react.

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:17.613
You don't always
have to retaliate.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.574
Predators and prey, Doc.

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.703
All right, a condition
of your probation

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:27.665
is that you continue therapy,
and I hope that you will try

01:25:27.832 --> 01:25:29.166
finding a new group.

01:25:29.333 --> 01:25:32.169
I know you had
a bad experience,

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:36.632
but can you just set down
the attitude for an hour

01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:39.385
and try to stay open?

01:25:42.012 --> 01:25:43.806
Yeah.

01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:46.433
All right. I will.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.020
Really?
That's great.

01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:53.440
You know, you can make
better choices for yourself.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:56.026
I worry about you.

01:25:56.193 --> 01:25:59.947
I know you do.
And I appreciate it.

01:26:00.114 --> 01:26:02.283
Okay, then.

01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:05.035
You can wait
for me outside, please.

01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:11.125
Wait for me outside.

01:26:34.565 --> 01:26:36.609
Back up, bitch.

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:07.932
Stop it!
