Next, please.

01:10.143 --> 01:11.728
Next!

01:24.407 --> 01:26.076
Don't fool around

01:26.284 --> 01:27.786
Okay

01:31.998 --> 01:33.667
Did you hear what I said?

01:34.584 --> 01:37.587
I want to document
our trip to America.

01:37.921 --> 01:39.547
Next, please. Next.

01:41.007 --> 01:43.510
How you doing?
Can I see your documents?

01:44.010 --> 01:47.180
What is the purpose of your
visit to the United States?

01:47.681 --> 01:48.306
Two weeks holiday.

01:48.765 --> 01:50.684
Do you have
a return-trip ticket?

01:51.184 --> 01:52.852
Excuse me. No photography
in the F.I.S. area.

01:53.353 --> 01:56.231
Is he travelling with you?
Are you two together?

01:56.690 --> 01:57.482
Yes.

01:57.941 --> 01:59.984
Sir, come on up. Join us.

02:01.945 --> 02:03.154
Is there a problem?

02:03.613 --> 02:06.032
No. If you're together
I want to talk to you together.

02:06.533 --> 02:08.326
-Can I see your documents?
-Sure.

02:08.785 --> 02:11.079
Passport, please.
Are you related?

02:11.538 --> 02:13.540
Yes. He's my friend.

02:17.377 --> 02:19.754
You're a Czech national
and you're a Russian national.

02:20.213 --> 02:21.965
How do you know one another?

02:22.465 --> 02:24.718
We know each other from Prague.

02:25.176 --> 02:27.637
-How long are you staying?
-Two weeks.

02:28.138 --> 02:29.639
I'd like him to answer
for himself.

02:30.098 --> 02:31.558
But he doesn't speak English.

02:32.058 --> 02:34.602
No, sir.
I speakvery good English.

02:35.937 --> 02:38.273
I'm here for movies.

02:38.732 --> 02:40.900
For movies?
I don't understand.

02:41.401 --> 02:43.987
When I was a boy,
I've seen at my school...

02:44.487 --> 02:47.741
movie called
"It's Wonderful Life..."

02:48.199 --> 02:49.909
directed by Frank Capra...

02:50.410 --> 02:53.496
and ever since I just want
to come to United States...

02:53.997 --> 02:56.333
Iand of the free,
home of the brave...

02:56.833 --> 02:59.002
a country where anyone
can be anything.

02:59.586 --> 03:00.879
Bullshit!

03:01.254 --> 03:02.672
"Abandoned baby
in Times Square."

03:03.173 --> 03:04.758
Come on,
it's too fucking soft.

03:05.258 --> 03:08.178
It won't work,
and it won't get the numbers.

03:08.678 --> 03:10.889
Are you suggesting that
we manufacture bad news?

03:11.348 --> 03:13.016
It's what they tune us infor.

03:13.516 --> 03:16.061
We're a tabloid show.
They tune infor rough stuff.

03:16.519 --> 03:17.979
The net work's up
my pretty little ass to change.

03:18.438 --> 03:20.440
Every lobbyist, mom,
and politician...

03:20.940 --> 03:22.192
is screaming about
violence in prime time.

03:22.692 --> 03:23.943
We've got to broaden the format.

03:24.444 --> 03:25.945
Broaden the format.

03:26.446 --> 03:27.989
The story they will run
is the one with the juice.

03:28.448 --> 03:29.866
They want ratings
as much as I do.

03:30.367 --> 03:32.827
If it bleeds, it leads.
What have you got?

03:33.286 --> 03:34.746
Ride-along with Eddie Flemming.

03:35.205 --> 03:36.414
-Fuck, again?!
-Cover of "People."

03:36.873 --> 03:38.875
He is not new.

03:39.376 --> 03:41.586
Eddie's a dear friend,
but we've done him to death.

03:42.045 --> 03:42.962
No, this is good.

03:43.463 --> 03:44.464
The psychiatrist
goes to trial tomorrow.

03:44.964 --> 03:46.966
The ratings'll hit the roof.
What's Eddie doing?

03:47.467 --> 03:48.760
He's staking out
a Jamaican serial killer.

03:49.219 --> 03:50.178
That's good.

03:50.637 --> 03:53.807
I don't want blood and guts!
Broaden the format!

03:54.307 --> 03:56.768
I know they brought you in
to be the journalism cop--

03:57.227 --> 03:59.312
-Excuse me!
-You're killing my show!

03:59.813 --> 04:02.273
Don't forget,
Eddie's always good TV.

04:02.732 --> 04:04.067
Not when he's drunk.

04:04.567 --> 04:06.569
He's got a new cure for that.

05:00.540 --> 05:03.793
-When?
-Tomorrow at lunch.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.347
Ready, set.

05:17.307 --> 05:18.892
Let's go.

05:21.394 --> 05:22.979
Thrill of the hunt.

05:57.514 --> 06:01.184
Look, Times square.
Just like the movies!

06:01.601 --> 06:02.977
Don't speak Russian!

06:03.436 --> 06:06.147
Why do I always have to
Speak to you in Czech?

06:06.523 --> 06:10.568
Because I don't like your
ugly language, okay?

06:20.704 --> 06:22.288
Taxi!

06:29.045 --> 06:31.214
"Fuji colour...

06:31.715 --> 06:34.384
"adjustable shutter speed...

06:34.884 --> 06:37.971
"nightvision, infrared...

06:38.471 --> 06:39.389
"black and white.

06:39.889 --> 06:43.101
"Make your own movies."

06:53.737 --> 06:55.905
Damn!
Watch where you're going!

07:01.494 --> 07:02.871
Where'd that big guy go
with the video?

07:03.329 --> 07:04.956
He stole my camera!
Stop that guy in the cab!

07:05.415 --> 07:07.709
-Go! Go!
-Stop that guy in the cab!

07:08.501 --> 07:10.920
Bryan,we're pulling up now.
This is important.

07:11.254 --> 07:13.048
I need fresh footage for
the piece on Eddie tonight...

07:13.506 --> 07:15.008
so come in fast on my signal
with the camera rolling.

07:15.508 --> 07:17.093
You got it?

07:24.684 --> 07:26.144
So what's Unique?

07:26.603 --> 07:28.772
Not what, who. From Jamaica.

07:29.272 --> 07:31.191
His girlfriend took too long
putting her make-up on.

07:31.691 --> 07:33.985
They were late for a party.

07:34.444 --> 07:36.946
-Stabbed her with a bottle.
-Jesus Christ.

07:37.447 --> 07:38.865
That's unique. Shit.

07:39.366 --> 07:41.493
He still went to the party.

07:44.621 --> 07:45.872
Topfloor, back room.

07:46.373 --> 07:47.666
Eddie, autograph, mon.

07:48.124 --> 07:49.751
Phone number.

07:50.210 --> 07:51.753
Why your picture not on this?

07:52.212 --> 07:53.838
-Bounce.
-All right.

07:55.465 --> 07:58.134
Yo, Unique.
5-0's on the way, bro.

07:58.551 --> 07:59.969
-Cops?
-Let's go.

08:00.470 --> 08:01.054
Love you too, man.

08:01.554 --> 08:02.889
Who does he think Leon was?

08:03.390 --> 08:04.474
It won't matter.

08:04.974 --> 08:06.351
He'll hear the cops are coming
and just get out.

08:06.810 --> 08:08.478
-Come on. Be quiet
-Right.

08:08.978 --> 08:11.022
-Stand by.
-Standing by.

08:11.481 --> 08:13.191
Eddie, are you gonna
be home tonight?

08:13.650 --> 08:14.901
We're running
the Stephen Geller piece.

08:15.402 --> 08:17.278
Again? You ran that fucking
thing a thousand times.

08:17.737 --> 08:19.280
So what?
He's going to court tomorrow.

08:19.739 --> 08:20.615
The psychiatrist's trial
is starting.

08:21.074 --> 08:22.701
Ratings'll be through the roof.

08:24.828 --> 08:27.288
Hey, get out.

08:31.084 --> 08:32.711
Do me a favour.
Cut my interview out.

08:33.169 --> 08:34.796
What for? Jesus Christ.

08:35.255 --> 08:37.256
Are you getting shit
from downtown? Fuck them.

08:37.756 --> 08:39.342
You're the only one
making big cases in this town.

08:39.842 --> 08:42.554
I bring the big cases,
that brings the big news.

08:43.013 --> 08:44.764
That stuff hurts
as much as it helps.

08:45.265 --> 08:47.142
Get real jealous downtown.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.769
Stay behind me.

08:50.270 --> 08:52.564
Hope this fuck don't run.
My knees are killing me.

08:53.023 --> 08:55.191
Be quiet. Get back.

08:55.692 --> 08:57.902
Are you worried about my safety?
I'm touched.

08:59.612 --> 09:00.947
Go! Get away!

09:01.448 --> 09:03.366
Just keep them out of my way.

09:03.867 --> 09:05.493
-You ready?
-Robert,we're ready.

09:05.952 --> 09:07.954
You ready? Let's go.

09:08.455 --> 09:11.499
Go on! Just get out!

09:14.961 --> 09:17.172
Come on,you fucking guys!
Come in rolling!

09:17.630 --> 09:19.215
What's your rush?
You going to a party?

09:19.716 --> 09:21.176
What you chase me for?

09:21.634 --> 09:23.595
You always leave your house
like that?

09:24.095 --> 09:25.430
This not my bloody house!

09:25.889 --> 09:28.516
-You live here?
-Me don't live here!

09:28.975 --> 09:30.185
That sounds like
burglary to me, pal.

09:30.643 --> 09:32.145
Eddie, any chance
we could get that again?

09:32.604 --> 09:34.522
I didn't want to do it
in the first place.

09:36.816 --> 09:39.527
Are you fucking kidding me?
Turn that fucking thing off!

09:39.986 --> 09:41.738
Are you out of your mind?
Where the hell were you?

09:42.238 --> 09:45.825
You two are a waste
of my goddamn life! Fuck!

10:01.049 --> 10:03.176
No, Emil, get the position.

10:03.677 --> 10:05.970
-What?
-First scene of my new movie.

10:06.429 --> 10:09.057
Collecting our share
from the bankjob.

10:09.516 --> 10:11.726
And...action.

10:15.605 --> 10:17.190
Just a moment!

10:20.777 --> 10:21.528
Who's there?

10:21.778 --> 10:23.113
It's Emil.

10:50.390 --> 10:52.017
How are you?

10:55.103 --> 10:56.855
Glad to see you.

11:03.903 --> 11:06.656
Olga said he didn't
know where you were.

11:06.906 --> 11:08.116
If you are trying to hide,

11:08.408 --> 11:11.786
You shouldn't write to her
with your return adress!

11:14.331 --> 11:16.666
Beautiful necklace.

11:28.011 --> 11:31.097
Effects. Video Effects.

11:31.264 --> 11:33.600
It wasn't my fault
you two got caught.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.185
I know.

11:35.685 --> 11:38.605
Please, it's hisfault.
It's really hisfault.

11:39.105 --> 11:40.607
Trying to get
the bank clerk's phone number.

11:41.107 --> 11:42.442
How could I wait?

11:42.942 --> 11:45.695
Hey, you didn't tell us
she was your wife!

11:46.196 --> 11:48.865
That's why I didn't tell you!
Because of what you did!

11:51.534 --> 11:53.453
Let'sforget all this shit!

11:55.288 --> 11:58.917
Hang on. Calm down.

12:01.211 --> 12:04.214
You know what?

12:04.714 --> 12:07.884
Give me my money.

12:09.719 --> 12:13.139
Emil,we spent it.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.183
What?

12:15.642 --> 12:18.186
Look at the way we live.

12:18.645 --> 12:19.437
I'm a plumber.

12:19.896 --> 12:21.314
Nice watch.

12:21.815 --> 12:24.025
You think I'd be working
if I had money?

12:27.654 --> 12:31.574
What's going on?
Just give me my money.

12:32.075 --> 12:33.034
I'll helpyou.

12:33.493 --> 12:34.160
You'll help me?

12:34.661 --> 12:36.496
I get you a job.

12:36.997 --> 12:37.622
A job?

12:38.081 --> 12:39.666
The money is good.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.334
A job as a plumber?

12:41.835 --> 12:43.712
It's easy. It's good.

12:44.170 --> 12:48.800
You think I came
to America to work?

12:49.259 --> 12:50.051
No way.

12:50.510 --> 12:52.679
We started over.
You can, too.

12:54.097 --> 12:56.891
Emil, please.
I'm your friend.

12:57.350 --> 12:59.978
I'm your friend--

13:00.437 --> 13:01.521
Sorry.

13:02.022 --> 13:06.317
It's my fault.
Emil, please--

13:06.776 --> 13:09.904
Emil, put down the knife!

13:10.363 --> 13:13.116
You spent all my money
while I was in prison?

13:13.616 --> 13:15.994
You're telling me to get a job?

13:16.453 --> 13:17.912
As a plumber,
fixing fucking toilets?!

13:18.371 --> 13:19.080
Please, put down the knife!

13:19.539 --> 13:21.583
-You're my friend!
-Yes, I am!

13:22.042 --> 13:23.251
You're my best friend!

13:23.710 --> 13:27.589
Please, put down the knife.
Emil, please.

13:45.565 --> 13:47.400
Shut up!

13:47.901 --> 13:49.569
Shut up!

14:12.509 --> 14:14.135
She saw.

14:16.763 --> 14:19.849
-What are you looking for?
-Her wallet, you idiot.

14:23.770 --> 14:27.732
Daphne Handlova. Six-month visa.

14:28.191 --> 14:31.486
Still here after two years.

14:31.945 --> 14:33.780
She'll call the police.
She will!

14:34.280 --> 14:35.865
She is illegal!

14:55.969 --> 14:58.513
Turn that fucking
sick thing off!

14:58.972 --> 15:01.307
Do as I say!

15:19.075 --> 15:22.912
What are you looking for?

15:27.834 --> 15:29.377
Ah, no!

15:29.836 --> 15:33.465
Bohemian barbecue.

16:17.634 --> 16:19.010
Man,what you got for me?

16:19.469 --> 16:20.720
I don't have time
for this tonight.

16:21.221 --> 16:22.389
Where the fuck you going?

16:22.889 --> 16:24.641
Do yourself a favour
and get the hell outta here.

16:25.141 --> 16:26.351
Gonna make me bust your ass?

16:26.810 --> 16:28.770
I'm not telling you again.
This ain't a smart move.

16:29.229 --> 16:30.814
Give me your fucking money--

16:31.314 --> 16:33.650
You happy now?
Now you're under arrest.

16:34.150 --> 16:35.985
-You the cops?
-Fire Department.

16:36.486 --> 16:37.696
Firemen don't carry
no damn guns.

16:38.154 --> 16:40.657
Guess again.
I'm an arson investigator.

16:41.157 --> 16:41.950
We do everything cops do.

16:42.409 --> 16:44.828
Yo, man, come on!

16:45.328 --> 16:46.788
All right,
we're getting up on three.

16:47.247 --> 16:48.248
One, two, three.

16:48.748 --> 16:50.875
Why don't you
let a brother off, man?

16:51.334 --> 16:53.628
No harm, nofoul.
My bad, dawg.

16:54.087 --> 16:56.047
What's up, man? Come on!

16:56.506 --> 16:59.718
-Put your hand up there.
-What you gonna do?

17:00.176 --> 17:02.220
-Where you going?
-To a fire.

17:02.679 --> 17:04.888
-Hell, no!
-I'll send a cop back!

17:05.348 --> 17:06.516
Oh, hell, mother fucker!

17:07.017 --> 17:09.352
You can't leave me hand cuffed
to no goddamn tree!

17:09.853 --> 17:12.439
Some freak'll come up
in here and stab me, man!

17:26.953 --> 17:29.331
Make sure EMS is standing by.

17:29.789 --> 17:31.333
We'll have to take
the bodies out pretty soon.

17:31.791 --> 17:34.502
Let's get the fourth winches
to the front of the building.

17:34.961 --> 17:36.338
Chief, you first due?

17:36.796 --> 17:39.966
Yeah. I got two roasts
up on the top floor.

17:40.467 --> 17:43.595
You don't have to investigate
because Homicide's here.

17:44.054 --> 17:45.597
Homicide?
Who said they could go up there?

17:46.056 --> 17:47.182
I didn't make this
a crime scene yet.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.310
-It's Eddie Flemming.
-Fuck him.

17:50.810 --> 17:52.395
Jordy, where you been?
We got a celebrity.

17:52.896 --> 17:55.231
I heard.
Who the hell let him up there?

17:55.732 --> 17:57.150
Don't know. Think Eddie'll
give me his autograph?

17:57.650 --> 17:59.235
Maybe he'll give you
a kiss, too.

18:02.989 --> 18:04.783
-Hey, Cap.
-Bobby.

18:05.241 --> 18:06.826
Stairs are soggy.

18:09.496 --> 18:11.331
-Hey, Eddie.
-What?

18:11.831 --> 18:13.375
Looks to me,
from the 69 position...

18:13.833 --> 18:15.293
that they were doing each other.

18:15.752 --> 18:16.753
They must've been
smoking something...

18:17.253 --> 18:18.755
and were so wacked
out of their heads...

18:19.255 --> 18:20.924
that they got careless,
lit up the mattress...

18:21.424 --> 18:23.343
and set themselves onfire.

18:23.843 --> 18:25.345
I don't know.
We got the experts here.

18:25.845 --> 18:27.013
Show them what you found?

18:27.514 --> 18:28.515
Hope you don't mind, guys.

18:29.015 --> 18:29.766
We thought maybe
you needed some help.

18:30.225 --> 18:32.394
Not at all.
Detective? Bobby Korfin.

18:32.852 --> 18:35.063
-How you doing, Bobby?
-My Uncle Tony worked with you.

18:35.522 --> 18:36.940
Detective,you mind
putting that cigar out?

18:37.399 --> 18:39.067
-Trying to pick up a scent.
-Sorry.

18:39.526 --> 18:42.737
I'm glad you guys
got it allfigured out...

18:43.196 --> 18:44.280
but you mind if we go
through our routine?

18:44.781 --> 18:46.408
Give us something to do.

18:46.866 --> 18:47.951
We don't mind.

18:48.451 --> 18:51.287
-No, certainly.
-Appreciate it.

18:51.788 --> 18:53.331
-Be our guest.
-Thanks.

18:53.832 --> 18:56.334
Talk about smoking after sex.

19:05.969 --> 19:08.221
We got a fast-burning fire.

19:09.639 --> 19:12.559
We got some good
low patterns down here.

19:16.062 --> 19:18.648
-Mouth's clean.
-Clean?

19:19.107 --> 19:20.775
So let me get this straight...

19:21.234 --> 19:23.236
you think a couple of crackheads
burned themselves up?

19:23.737 --> 19:25.030
That's what it looks like to me.

19:25.488 --> 19:26.531
While they're burning up...

19:26.990 --> 19:28.450
they're still going down
on one another?

19:28.908 --> 19:30.160
Gotta hand it to them.

19:30.660 --> 19:32.829
I guess some people have
their priorities straight.

19:33.330 --> 19:34.998
I guess they do.

19:39.044 --> 19:40.712
Flammable.

19:42.172 --> 19:43.381
Thank you.

19:43.882 --> 19:45.425
-What's that?
-Evidence.

19:45.925 --> 19:47.677
Of a homicide.

19:49.471 --> 19:51.806
-You know what that is?
-No,what?

19:52.265 --> 19:54.017
Camello,
punch a hole in the corner.

19:54.517 --> 19:56.144
I want to look at the floor.

19:59.856 --> 20:02.108
They have no soot
in their mouths...

20:02.609 --> 20:03.568
which means they weren't
breathing before the fire...

20:04.027 --> 20:05.904
and this little piece
of cloth...

20:06.363 --> 20:07.572
means they were doused
in a flammable liquid...

20:08.031 --> 20:09.949
and then positioned
like this on the bed.

20:10.450 --> 20:11.826
To the untrained eye,
it looks like an accident.

20:12.285 --> 20:13.244
No offence.

20:13.703 --> 20:15.413
What's he looking for?

20:19.042 --> 20:20.627
He's looking for a timer.

20:26.299 --> 20:29.094
Here you go.
Big double homicide.

20:30.470 --> 20:32.263
Good.

20:33.640 --> 20:34.683
Just take some deep breaths.

20:35.141 --> 20:37.644
Did you see the look
on Eddie'sface...

20:38.144 --> 20:39.604
when you handed him
that timer?

20:40.063 --> 20:42.190
Damn, I wish
I had a picture of him.

20:42.649 --> 20:44.275
He knew all along, though.

20:44.734 --> 20:45.402
What?

20:45.902 --> 20:47.153
Why do you think
he was so quiet?

20:47.654 --> 20:48.988
He was testing us.

20:49.489 --> 20:51.074
You think so?

20:53.243 --> 20:54.536
Detective,
does it look like a murder?

20:54.995 --> 20:56.788
We haven't determined
the exact cause of death yet.

20:57.247 --> 20:57.956
There's a lot of answers
we still haven't got.

20:58.415 --> 21:00.625
-How many victims?
-Two bodies.

21:01.084 --> 21:02.919
-Have you identified them?
-Not positively.

21:03.378 --> 21:04.379
Is it drug-related?

21:04.838 --> 21:07.716
We don't know the cause
of the fire or the deaths.

21:08.216 --> 21:10.010
We get them all,
we'll let you know.

21:10.510 --> 21:12.137
What's this in your hand?
Evidence?

21:12.637 --> 21:13.847
This is something
we found on the scene.

21:14.347 --> 21:16.391
Whether it's evidence or not
has yet to be determined.

21:16.850 --> 21:18.393
-Thank you, Detective.
-You're welcome.

21:23.273 --> 21:25.150
See you.

21:44.544 --> 21:45.587
Do you see her?

21:46.046 --> 21:47.547
Who?

21:48.048 --> 21:50.216
There was a woman in the crowd.
She looked scared.

21:50.675 --> 21:52.719
Looked like
she wanted to talk to us.

21:55.305 --> 21:56.681
Shit.

22:07.233 --> 22:08.860
Get a blanket.

22:09.319 --> 22:11.529
Now here you come.
It's about fucking time.

22:11.988 --> 22:13.073
What the hell happened to you?

22:13.573 --> 22:15.617
She stripped me, man.
A bag lady.

22:16.117 --> 22:17.118
Stripped all my clothes off.

22:17.577 --> 22:19.746
Grabbing me in my nuts.
It was disgusting.

22:20.246 --> 22:22.457
Consider yourself lucky.
I won't lock you up.

22:22.916 --> 22:24.250
You're free to go.
Get the hell outta here.

22:24.709 --> 22:26.044
A dog pissed on me, man!

22:26.544 --> 22:27.879
You violated my civil rights.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.590
We got you for robbery one.
Take a walk.

22:31.174 --> 22:33.677
So, before you slept with her...

22:34.094 --> 22:36.554
with your own son's wife...

22:37.013 --> 22:39.557
did you take even a second to
think about the consequences?

22:40.016 --> 22:42.769
I take full responsibility
for sleeping with her.

22:43.269 --> 22:44.813
I had very low self-esteem.

22:45.313 --> 22:48.942
I had to compete with somebody.
It happened to be my son.

22:49.442 --> 22:52.237
You're blaming this
on low self-esteem?

22:52.737 --> 22:54.114
I had a lot of
behavioural disorders.

22:54.614 --> 22:56.408
A behavioural disorder
and low self-esteem...

22:56.908 --> 22:58.159
makes you have sex
with your son's wife?

22:58.618 --> 22:59.911
It's not all hisfault.

23:00.370 --> 23:03.289
No, that's true.
What about your wife?

23:03.790 --> 23:06.626
He's ignored me for months.
I had no one around.

23:07.127 --> 23:08.962
I didn't think that
he loved me anymore.

23:21.224 --> 23:23.810
How could somebody
who loved somebody do that?

23:24.310 --> 23:26.062
That's the lowest thing
you could ever possibly do.

23:26.563 --> 23:28.940
"Self-esteem."

23:36.239 --> 23:38.450
"Low self-esteem."

23:44.331 --> 23:45.248
Turn off the camera.

23:45.665 --> 23:46.875
I'm not filming anything.

23:47.334 --> 23:48.126
Turn off the fucking camera!

23:48.418 --> 23:49.878
I'm watching Milos die.

23:50.754 --> 23:51.713
Turn it off!

23:53.673 --> 23:54.507
Let go.

23:56.426 --> 23:57.844
Don't break it! Don't break it!

23:58.428 --> 23:59.429
How do you erase it?

23:59.596 --> 24:00.472
I'll do it! I'll do it!

24:00.680 --> 24:01.556
Get rid of it!

24:03.600 --> 24:05.101
Don't speak to me in Russian.

24:05.602 --> 24:08.146
You got it?

24:09.439 --> 24:11.858
Erase it! Erase it now!

24:12.275 --> 24:14.194
Just erase it!

24:25.789 --> 24:28.541
Daphne Handlova.

24:34.714 --> 24:36.216
What's this?

24:38.051 --> 24:39.469
"Worldly Escorts."

24:39.969 --> 24:41.930
"Worldly." What is it?

24:44.974 --> 24:46.559
What is it?

24:47.811 --> 24:50.188
I'm serious.
Get on your knees.

24:59.572 --> 25:01.032
Look me in the eyes
and tell me you're sorry.

25:01.491 --> 25:03.243
Let me see if I believe you.

25:03.743 --> 25:04.953
I'm very sorry
for what I've done.

25:05.412 --> 25:06.871
I promise
I'll never do it again.

25:07.330 --> 25:09.124
How come we don't believe you?

25:12.419 --> 25:14.504
Are you looking
for companionship?

25:15.005 --> 25:16.715
Yes. I'm homesick.

25:17.173 --> 25:21.386
I can set you up
with a realfine date.

25:21.845 --> 25:24.055
Do you have Eastern European
girl, Czech girl?

25:24.514 --> 25:26.725
-Of course.
-Askfor Russian girl.

25:27.183 --> 25:29.853
Whatever you want.
As a matter off act...

25:30.353 --> 25:33.773
I have a lovely
Czech girl right here.

25:34.274 --> 25:36.818
Send her. I take her.

25:37.277 --> 25:38.653
What's your address?

25:39.112 --> 25:41.948
-Can you forgive him?
-Give me a hug.

25:42.449 --> 25:43.742
Wait a minute. Hold on.

25:48.955 --> 25:52.417
That's a good start there.

26:12.854 --> 26:13.938
Now that you know Eddie,
maybe he'll put you...

26:14.397 --> 26:15.774
in the next movie about him.

26:16.232 --> 26:16.900
You think so?

26:17.359 --> 26:19.110
You can play his wife.

26:22.489 --> 26:23.740
What's up, Chief?

26:24.199 --> 26:25.825
What the hell is that?

26:26.284 --> 26:28.495
What is that in your hand?
Evidence?

26:28.953 --> 26:29.871
This is something
we found on the scene.

26:30.330 --> 26:32.207
Whether it's evidence or not,
we're not sure.

26:32.666 --> 26:35.335
You gave Eddie Flemming
the evidence?

26:35.794 --> 26:37.087
Who did cause and origin?

26:37.545 --> 26:39.339
Chief,who do you think did?
We did.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.800
Then why didn't you
talk to the reporter?

26:42.258 --> 26:43.843
Because we got more
important things to do...

26:44.302 --> 26:45.887
Iike finding out who did it.

26:46.346 --> 26:47.972
Really?

26:51.643 --> 26:53.228
Don't you guys understand?

26:53.687 --> 26:54.979
It is all about image.

26:55.438 --> 26:58.483
The better we look,
the more money I get to pay you.

27:12.914 --> 27:14.416
Good evening.
I'm Robert Hawkins...

27:14.874 --> 27:16.543
and this is "Top Story."

27:17.002 --> 27:19.212
Tonight we have an exclusive
interview with Stephen Geller...

27:19.671 --> 27:20.922
who horrified the nation
two years ago...

27:21.381 --> 27:24.884
when he murdered three clerks
in a Manhattan shoe store.

27:25.343 --> 27:27.095
But now, Mr Geller's claim...

27:27.554 --> 27:29.514
spoken softly
and articulately...

27:29.973 --> 27:32.684
is that he is the victim.

27:33.143 --> 27:35.603
Hard to believe. Watch.

27:37.605 --> 27:39.816
These people died...

27:40.275 --> 27:42.652
because of the criminal actions
of my psychiatrist.

27:43.111 --> 27:45.030
He didn't insist
that I stay on my medication.

27:45.488 --> 27:48.116
So you feel absolutely
no responsibility...

27:48.575 --> 27:49.534
for killing these people?

27:49.993 --> 27:52.412
It was my finger
that pulled the trigger...

27:52.871 --> 27:55.206
but morally,
I'm not responsible.

27:55.665 --> 27:57.876
My psychiatrist
knew what I was capable of.

27:58.335 --> 27:59.502
How can I know?
I'm not a doctor.

27:59.961 --> 28:02.130
That seems very savvy
for a man who's beenfound...

28:02.589 --> 28:03.965
mentally incompetent
to stand trial.

28:04.424 --> 28:05.967
I'm a victim here, too.

28:06.426 --> 28:08.470
My life has been
permanently disrupted.

28:08.928 --> 28:10.096
Permanently disrupted?

28:10.555 --> 28:12.140
Hasn't this "incident,"
as you call it...

28:12.599 --> 28:14.184
jump-started your career
as an artist?

28:14.642 --> 28:16.311
Isn't there a movie
in the works?

28:16.770 --> 28:18.772
We're in negotiations.
That's correct.

28:19.230 --> 28:22.108
Doesn't the "Son of Sam" Iaw
prohibit convicted criminals...

28:22.567 --> 28:23.568
from profiting
from their crimes?

28:24.027 --> 28:26.404
It doesn't apply to me
because I'm not a criminal.

28:26.863 --> 28:29.366
I wasn't convicted.

28:29.824 --> 28:32.827
I wasfound to be
temporarily insane.

28:33.286 --> 28:36.122
I love America.

28:36.581 --> 28:39.668
No one is responsible
for what they do.

28:43.171 --> 28:45.507
-Get in the bathroom.
-We'll fuck her first.

28:45.965 --> 28:47.634
-Get in.
-Fuck her first, right?

28:48.093 --> 28:50.303
Stay there! Shut up!

29:01.648 --> 29:04.609
I'm Honey
from Worldly Escorts.

29:05.068 --> 29:06.861
You called us?

29:07.320 --> 29:09.906
And how are you tonight?

29:10.365 --> 29:12.534
Where's the Czech girl?

29:12.993 --> 29:14.577
Baby, I'm whatever
you want me to be.

29:15.036 --> 29:20.250
I'm a little schoolgirl,
I'm Mommy, I'm a Czech girl.

29:20.709 --> 29:22.127
Now, I like to get business
out of the way...

29:22.585 --> 29:23.503
before we get down
to pleasure...

29:23.962 --> 29:26.381
so can you put the money
on the dresser?

29:26.840 --> 29:29.718
But I need the Czech girl.

29:30.176 --> 29:32.095
Daphne. You know her?

29:32.554 --> 29:35.098
It's an outcall service
run from a loft.

29:35.557 --> 29:37.308
I don't know the other girls.

29:37.767 --> 29:38.977
Aren't you getting undressed?

29:39.436 --> 29:40.228
Where's the escort service?

29:40.687 --> 29:42.063
That's confidential.

29:42.522 --> 29:45.025
Can you put the money
on the dresser, please?

29:45.483 --> 29:47.235
Yes. Sure.

29:47.694 --> 29:49.070
Thank you.

29:58.204 --> 30:02.417
I'd like to talkwith the person
who runs the service.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.773
Sorry, no smoking.

30:11.026 --> 30:13.028
When I'm through with you...

30:13.487 --> 30:17.282
you won't even remember
the Czech girl.

30:20.077 --> 30:22.621
Listen to me.

30:25.248 --> 30:27.042
I don't want sex.

30:28.377 --> 30:31.672
Just give me the address,
please.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.966
Look, I don't give a shit
if you want sex or not...

30:35.425 --> 30:36.343
but you're paying for my time.

30:36.802 --> 30:37.803
Just listen to me.

30:38.261 --> 30:41.598
Give me the address,
and then you can go.

30:42.057 --> 30:44.893
What are you doing?

30:45.352 --> 30:47.187
Listen to me.
You got to help me!

30:47.646 --> 30:49.690
Just calm down
and listen to me.

30:50.148 --> 30:52.651
Give me the fucking address,
and then you go!

30:53.110 --> 30:55.654
Please,you got to help me.

30:56.113 --> 30:57.656
I need your help!

31:06.581 --> 31:08.834
All right! OK!

31:09.292 --> 31:11.128
It's in my purse. No!

31:11.586 --> 31:13.213
Shit! God!

31:16.425 --> 31:18.301
Help me!

31:19.594 --> 31:20.345
No! Help me!

31:20.804 --> 31:24.057
No! God! Someone!
Please help!

31:29.104 --> 31:30.814
No! Help!

31:36.666 --> 31:39.169
What really stood out
about this girl were her eyes.

31:39.627 --> 31:43.131
She had the most amazing huge
blue eyes you've ever seen.

31:43.590 --> 31:46.718
Just absolutely beautiful.

31:47.177 --> 31:48.386
How long they been
living in your building?

31:48.845 --> 31:51.056
Fouryears.

31:51.514 --> 31:53.558
I'll give you a call as soon
as we know something more.

31:54.017 --> 31:57.103
-What do you got?
-Milos and Tamina Karlova.

31:57.562 --> 31:58.897
They were quiet
and kept to themselves.

31:59.356 --> 32:01.232
Landlord don't know
who your girl is.

32:47.320 --> 32:48.947
OK if I smoke?

32:50.323 --> 32:52.075
It's your crime scene now.

32:52.534 --> 32:53.785
Do whateveryou want.

32:54.244 --> 32:56.538
Did you watch the news?

32:56.997 --> 32:58.873
I must have missed it.

32:59.958 --> 33:01.876
Just so you know...

33:03.169 --> 33:05.296
I gave you guys all the credit.

33:05.755 --> 33:08.091
Well,just so you know...

33:08.550 --> 33:11.011
I don't really care
about that stuff.

33:11.469 --> 33:13.680
Why should you?

33:14.139 --> 33:15.932
I don't even watch TV.

33:16.391 --> 33:20.103
Good. Good.
That's commendable.

33:24.107 --> 33:25.692
You get a report from the M.E.?

33:26.151 --> 33:28.320
Sure did.

33:29.612 --> 33:31.656
I want to ask you something.

33:32.115 --> 33:33.616
You got a problem with me?

33:34.075 --> 33:37.495
If you showed up and found me
stepping on your crime scene...

33:37.954 --> 33:40.123
and remember, it was
my crime scene yesterday...

33:40.582 --> 33:42.208
it might piss you off, too.

33:46.338 --> 33:47.630
What about the report?

33:48.089 --> 33:50.342
You were right.
Both dead before the fire.

33:50.800 --> 33:51.926
The man was stabbed so hard...

33:52.385 --> 33:54.554
the killer broke off the tip
of the knife in his spine.

33:55.013 --> 33:57.557
That usually indicates
something pretty personal.

34:10.235 --> 34:11.905
Super said
he's seen her before...

34:12.364 --> 34:15.324
but she didn't live here.

34:16.618 --> 34:18.328
Prettiest suspect
I've had in a while.

34:18.786 --> 34:21.539
I don't know if she has
anything to do with this.

34:21.998 --> 34:23.750
I saw her outside
after the fire...

34:24.208 --> 34:25.251
and thought maybe
it was a lead.

34:25.710 --> 34:26.920
Thought maybe
she saw something.

34:27.379 --> 34:30.382
Why would they
have taken the trouble...

34:32.884 --> 34:35.428
to position the bodies
like that?

34:37.013 --> 34:39.264
Maybe they're trying
to send somebody a message.

34:39.724 --> 34:42.518
Burial rites are very serious
in Eastern Europe.

34:42.976 --> 34:43.895
Could be to humiliate them.

34:44.353 --> 34:45.647
How do you know all this?

34:46.106 --> 34:48.149
My folks were from Poland.

34:55.322 --> 34:56.574
Where?

34:57.033 --> 34:57.993
You sure it was a knife?

34:58.451 --> 35:00.704
Really?

35:04.749 --> 35:06.459
There was another murder on...

35:06.918 --> 35:08.670
8th Avenue in a hotel.

35:09.129 --> 35:10.630
A stabbing.

35:11.089 --> 35:13.216
Clerk said
a Russian rented the room.

35:13.675 --> 35:15.927
Mind if I go along with you?

35:16.386 --> 35:19.264
This isn't afire.
There's nothing foryou to do.

35:19.723 --> 35:22.058
I'll watch you.
Maybe I'll learn something.

35:22.517 --> 35:23.727
This isn't
homicide school, kid.

35:24.185 --> 35:27.022
But if you want to help,
take that.

35:27.480 --> 35:28.773
What's this?

35:29.232 --> 35:31.526
The matching set
for the murder weapon.

35:37.824 --> 35:39.826
This is our second day
in America.

35:40.285 --> 35:41.953
First day was very exciting...

35:42.412 --> 35:44.247
full of thrills and chills.

35:44.706 --> 35:48.168
Over here is the co-star
of my new movie.

35:48.626 --> 35:50.587
My partner Emil.

35:51.046 --> 35:53.298
Who's this?

35:53.757 --> 35:55.467
That is New York'sfinest.

35:55.925 --> 35:57.802
That's his case.

36:01.389 --> 36:02.724
Is that all you want?

36:03.183 --> 36:06.603
Do you know how much killer
getsfor movie rights?

36:07.062 --> 36:08.229
It says in there
he wants a million.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.315
A million?

36:10.774 --> 36:11.983
You're kidding.

36:12.442 --> 36:15.904
The killer gets million dollars
for television interview?

36:16.363 --> 36:18.531
It pays to be a killer
in this country.

36:23.953 --> 36:26.831
-Just taking a bath.
-Any ID?

36:27.290 --> 36:30.251
-P.D. only.
-He's OK.

36:30.710 --> 36:31.836
We still got
to run some prints.

36:32.295 --> 36:36.007
This kid here from Midtown
caught the case.

36:36.466 --> 36:38.718
How you doing?
Tommy Cullen.

36:39.177 --> 36:40.345
It's a pleasure
tofinally meet you.

36:40.804 --> 36:43.098
This is what we got.
Figure she's a prostitute.

36:43.556 --> 36:45.850
Judging from the defence wounds
on her arms and hands...

36:46.309 --> 36:47.852
she was really fighting
for her life.

36:48.311 --> 36:52.232
The room was registered
to a Frank Capra.

36:52.691 --> 36:55.318
-Who said this guy's Russian?
-The clerk.

36:55.777 --> 36:57.612
Check the switchboard.
See what calls went out.

36:58.071 --> 36:59.656
I'm on it.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

37:00.115 --> 37:02.492
We're waiting on the M.E.
tofind out if she was raped.

37:02.951 --> 37:03.994
We got a shitload
of prints here...

37:04.452 --> 37:05.954
but in this joint,
they could be anybody's.

37:06.413 --> 37:11.876
Anybody take a piss lately?
Check the toilet seat.

37:12.335 --> 37:15.046
Only one guy checked in?

37:23.096 --> 37:24.889
You want to go
to homicide school?

37:25.348 --> 37:26.808
Let me show you something.

37:27.267 --> 37:29.853
The killer was standing
over there, slashing her.

37:30.311 --> 37:31.855
At the point of death,
the heart stops beating...

37:32.313 --> 37:34.774
so you don't bleed anymore.
See these two marks?

37:35.233 --> 37:39.696
Somebody was over here while
the killer was stabbing her.

37:40.155 --> 37:42.657
What kind of knife you think
we're talking about here?

37:43.116 --> 37:47.078
If you look at the marks
on the wall over here...

37:47.537 --> 37:49.497
they're wide,
but notvery deep.

37:49.956 --> 37:52.500
This was not your everyday
kitchen or pocketknife.

37:52.959 --> 37:54.252
What if the tipwas broken off?

37:54.711 --> 37:56.629
Could be. Then we'd probably
find it somewhere.

37:57.088 --> 37:58.298
I thinkwe already found it.

37:58.757 --> 38:02.093
There was only one phone call
made last night.

38:02.552 --> 38:04.012
I dialled it,
and it was an escort service.

38:04.471 --> 38:07.432
-You identify yourself?
-I'm new, not stupid.

38:07.891 --> 38:10.769
Call communications.
Get an address on that number.

38:14.022 --> 38:16.691
-Good work.
-Thanks.

38:17.150 --> 38:18.693
So you gonna head over
to the escort service?

38:19.152 --> 38:21.071
I'll let you know what happens.

38:21.529 --> 38:23.573
Eddie, you the man, bro!

38:24.032 --> 38:25.116
Eddie, this is ridiculous.

38:25.575 --> 38:28.161
If I ride along with you,
we could talk over the case.

38:28.620 --> 38:30.955
Tell you what.
I'll bounce this coin.

38:31.414 --> 38:32.582
If you win,you come with me.

38:33.041 --> 38:33.792
If you don't win,
you don't come with me.

38:34.250 --> 38:35.585
Fair enough?

38:36.044 --> 38:37.754
All right, but I call it.

38:38.213 --> 38:39.839
You call it.

38:43.426 --> 38:45.261
-Tails.
-Heads. You lose.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.640
That's bullshit.
I didn't get to see.

38:49.099 --> 38:50.934
Go ahead. I'll call it.

38:51.393 --> 38:55.021
Heads.
See? You lost twice.

38:58.274 --> 39:00.235
See you around.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.446
Come on.

39:03.905 --> 39:05.740
All right.

39:16.459 --> 39:17.711
That supposed to be funny?

39:18.169 --> 39:20.672
Yeah, come on.

39:22.674 --> 39:23.508
I was just joking.

39:23.967 --> 39:25.135
Thanks for letting me
come along.

39:25.802 --> 39:27.429
No problem. Souvenir.

39:28.930 --> 39:30.765
Two heads.

39:31.224 --> 39:32.183
Better than one.

39:32.642 --> 39:35.228
Police. We just want to
ask you some questions.

39:35.687 --> 39:36.563
Do you have a warrant?

39:37.022 --> 39:38.523
We're not looking
to bust you, ma'am.

39:38.982 --> 39:40.734
It's Detective Eddie Flemming
from Homicide.

39:41.192 --> 39:43.278
Just open the door.
We want to talk.

39:43.737 --> 39:45.363
My God,what an honour.

39:45.822 --> 39:47.991
Rose Hearn.
Please come in.

39:48.450 --> 39:51.411
I just saw you on television.

39:51.870 --> 39:54.414
You look better in real life.

39:54.873 --> 39:56.875
Just give me one second.

40:06.843 --> 40:09.346
So,what can I help
you with, Detective?

40:09.804 --> 40:11.056
We don't have any ID yet...

40:11.514 --> 40:13.892
but we found one of your girls
at the King Edward Hotel.

40:14.351 --> 40:16.603
What?

40:17.062 --> 40:18.396
Did you send anybody over there?

40:18.855 --> 40:22.275
Yeah. Honey.

40:22.734 --> 40:25.570
She's one of my girls.
She's dead?

40:26.029 --> 40:26.655
I'm afraid so.

40:27.113 --> 40:28.740
Oh, my God.

40:29.199 --> 40:31.117
Are you all right?

40:31.576 --> 40:33.328
-Do you want some water?
-Please.

40:33.787 --> 40:35.330
Get some water, please.

40:35.789 --> 40:36.623
Do you know
what she was doing there?

40:37.082 --> 40:40.126
She was on a date
with a guy.

40:40.585 --> 40:43.088
He called asking for
a Czechoslovakian girl.

40:43.546 --> 40:44.839
I sent him Honey.

40:45.298 --> 40:47.258
Once they get there,
it doesn't really matter.

40:47.717 --> 40:48.426
Do you have Czech girls
working for you?

40:48.885 --> 40:53.139
No, but he insisted on one.

40:53.598 --> 40:55.975
Does this girl
look familiar to you?

41:00.105 --> 41:01.731
Linda?

41:08.613 --> 41:09.698
What were you saying?

41:10.156 --> 41:12.826
I think I know this girl.
Her name is Daphne.

41:13.284 --> 41:14.244
She's a Czech girl.

41:14.703 --> 41:16.079
I tried to recruit her
and gave her my card.

41:16.538 --> 41:19.916
I never heard backfrom her.
She's very popular suddenly.

41:20.375 --> 41:21.376
Do you have a last name?

41:21.835 --> 41:26.840
No. I just had two guys come in
asking about her.

41:27.298 --> 41:28.466
Who were they?

41:28.925 --> 41:32.470
One guy said he was her cousin
was trying tofind her.

41:32.929 --> 41:35.974
They had a video camera,
and I wanted them out...

41:36.433 --> 41:37.434
so I told them where she worked.

41:37.892 --> 41:38.560
Where's that?

41:39.019 --> 41:40.562
It's a salon
on 63rd and Madison.

41:41.021 --> 41:44.941
-What's the name?
-Ludwig's. She washes hair.

41:47.569 --> 41:50.697
Leon, Ludwig's Hair Salon.
Suspects might be there.

41:51.156 --> 41:52.365
We think
the suspects are there.

41:52.824 --> 41:53.491
-Right away!
-Hurry!

41:53.950 --> 41:55.118
Want a sip?

41:55.577 --> 41:57.746
-I'm on duty.
-So am l.

42:17.474 --> 42:19.100
Hunting for Daphne.

42:22.854 --> 42:24.522
I'll go inside.
You cover the exit.

42:24.981 --> 42:25.857
Of course.

42:26.316 --> 42:28.443
I always wanted to be a cop...

42:28.902 --> 42:30.111
when I was a kid.

42:30.570 --> 42:32.072
I dreamt about
pulling out my gun...

42:32.530 --> 42:34.908
kicking the door in,
yelling "Freeze"!

42:36.785 --> 42:37.952
What did you dream about?

42:38.411 --> 42:40.413
Running into a burning building,
kicking down the door...

42:40.872 --> 42:42.874
rushing through the smoke,
and saving a kid.

42:43.333 --> 42:45.627
Then I guess we're doing it
the right way.

42:46.086 --> 42:48.838
If it was a burning building,
I'd let you gofirst.

42:50.340 --> 42:51.675
Watch out.

42:54.052 --> 42:55.303
Fuck.

42:55.762 --> 42:58.056
The thrill of the hunt.

43:03.895 --> 43:05.772
Excuse me.

43:06.231 --> 43:07.357
Sorry.

43:07.816 --> 43:08.775
I'm looking for Daphne.

43:09.234 --> 43:11.861
I don't know where she went.
Maybe infront.

43:12.320 --> 43:13.822
Thanks.

43:40.015 --> 43:41.725
I've got a temper.

43:42.183 --> 43:44.602
When I lose it,
I lose control.

43:45.061 --> 43:47.772
Get out of here!

43:48.231 --> 43:49.858
I didn't intend to kill Milos.

43:50.317 --> 43:53.403
When I went to prison,
they beat me.

43:53.862 --> 43:56.906
I still didn't tell
he was my partner.

43:57.365 --> 43:59.701
I loved Milos like a brother.

44:01.161 --> 44:04.080
Daphne,will you
be coming back to work?

44:04.539 --> 44:07.083
-In a minute, Ludwig.
-Come!

44:07.542 --> 44:09.878
Thank you.

44:10.337 --> 44:12.672
I don't want to kill you.

44:13.131 --> 44:15.675
But if you talk...

44:16.134 --> 44:18.386
I will.

44:22.223 --> 44:25.477
I thought you'd want it.

44:25.935 --> 44:27.604
This was Tamina's necklace.

44:28.063 --> 44:30.106
Keep it.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.986
Let's get out of here.

44:40.325 --> 44:41.951
Good-bye, my love.

44:57.926 --> 44:59.761
Your name's Daphne, right?

45:00.220 --> 45:02.639
Remember last night at the fire,
you saw me?

45:03.098 --> 45:05.225
Last night,you wanted
to tell me something.

45:05.684 --> 45:07.936
I got it.
I smell smoke across the street.

45:08.395 --> 45:09.229
We just want to talk to you.

45:09.688 --> 45:11.982
We're here to protect you.
No problem.

45:12.440 --> 45:14.317
You speak English?

45:14.776 --> 45:17.529
You speak English, don't you?

45:17.988 --> 45:19.614
Let's go this way.

45:25.203 --> 45:27.872
Did two guys come
and visit you today?

45:32.085 --> 45:34.170
What's that?
Who gave you this?

45:44.180 --> 45:45.724
Across the street,
two guys with a video camera.

45:46.182 --> 45:47.767
Don't look! It's OK.

45:48.226 --> 45:49.519
Let's just box them in.

45:49.978 --> 45:51.187
You stay here with her.

45:53.648 --> 45:55.567
Come on, let's go!

46:10.206 --> 46:12.917
Shit! Go!

46:16.671 --> 46:18.548
Goddamn!

46:21.676 --> 46:22.969
Split up!

46:23.428 --> 46:25.347
Fuck! Go!

46:27.349 --> 46:29.726
Son of a bitch!

46:34.481 --> 46:36.733
Get the fuck out of the road!

46:44.741 --> 46:47.118
Move! Damn!

46:48.536 --> 46:50.246
On the bus!

47:01.549 --> 47:02.759
-Look out!
-Be careful!

47:07.389 --> 47:10.141
Excuse me! Move! I'm a cop!

47:28.493 --> 47:29.452
Look, look!

47:29.911 --> 47:31.371
Watch out! Watch out!

47:35.417 --> 47:37.669
Perfect! Cut! Print! Go!

47:43.842 --> 47:45.176
Bobby,you OK?

47:45.635 --> 47:48.096
I'm all right.
They went towards the park!

47:49.347 --> 47:51.558
-You hit?
-No.

47:52.017 --> 47:55.979
Got my piece.

48:16.082 --> 48:18.293
Did you get him?

48:20.211 --> 48:21.838
Think so.

48:26.968 --> 48:27.927
I'm here, Leon.

48:28.386 --> 48:29.971
I'm having a bad day, man.

48:30.430 --> 48:32.015
You'll be OK.

48:34.184 --> 48:35.894
We've surrounded the park.
They've disappeared.

48:37.937 --> 48:39.314
Detective, can you tell us
what happened?

48:39.773 --> 48:41.900
-I can't talk right now.
-Give me a break.

48:42.359 --> 48:44.694
Excuse me,what's
the Fire Marshal doing here?

48:45.153 --> 48:46.529
I can't give out any statements
right now. I'm sorry.

48:46.988 --> 48:48.657
I understand your partner,
Leon Jackson, is injured.

48:49.115 --> 48:50.742
He was hurt, not seriously.

48:51.201 --> 48:52.535
Do you have a suspect
in custody?

48:52.994 --> 48:54.579
Now's not a good time, OK?

48:55.038 --> 48:55.622
Detective Jackson
was not hurt seriously.

48:56.081 --> 48:57.123
That's all I can tell you.

48:57.582 --> 48:59.084
All right.
Eddie, are you all right?

48:59.542 --> 49:01.086
Not a good time.

49:01.544 --> 49:03.171
All right.

49:05.799 --> 49:07.634
If you'd just be willing
to cooperate...

49:08.093 --> 49:09.511
Let me tell you something.

49:09.969 --> 49:12.389
I want to know who they are
and how you're involved now!

49:12.847 --> 49:14.474
I don't know who they are.
I've never seen them before.

49:14.933 --> 49:17.560
I was there showering,
and Tamina is a friend of mine.

49:18.019 --> 49:19.104
My shower was broken,
so she let me use theirs.

49:19.562 --> 49:20.730
Go on.

49:21.189 --> 49:22.524
That's it.
I saw the killings.

49:22.983 --> 49:24.067
Why are you protecting them?

49:24.526 --> 49:25.819
I'm protecting myself.

49:26.277 --> 49:28.446
From what?
Are you here illegally?

49:28.905 --> 49:30.365
Don't worry about that.
We'll talk to lmmigration.

49:30.824 --> 49:33.243
-Don't talk to lmmigration.
-Why not?

49:33.702 --> 49:35.537
We'll find out
one way or another.

49:35.996 --> 49:38.790
Better that it comes from you.
You understand?

49:48.425 --> 49:49.509
You want to sit down?

49:49.968 --> 49:51.594
Why don't you sit down?

49:54.681 --> 49:56.599
You want a glass of water?

50:09.779 --> 50:12.991
My little sister and I
shared a flat.

50:13.450 --> 50:18.121
I came home one night,
and a man was raping her.

50:18.580 --> 50:21.750
His gun was on the chair,
and I grabbed it...

50:22.208 --> 50:25.170
and when he came at me,
I shot him.

50:25.628 --> 50:26.713
Justifiable homicide.

50:27.172 --> 50:30.008
Yes, but he was a cop.

50:30.467 --> 50:33.553
So you shot him,
and you killed a cop?

50:34.012 --> 50:37.098
I was living in a small town
in Slovakia.

50:37.557 --> 50:38.558
We don't want to hear
your life story.

50:39.017 --> 50:40.477
I got an officer
shot out there.

50:40.935 --> 50:42.020
Just tell us where
we can find these guys.

50:42.479 --> 50:44.356
You're a cop.
I know you won't help me.

50:44.814 --> 50:47.067
You're right.
Not unless you help us.

50:47.525 --> 50:51.363
Eddie, can I talk to you
alone for a second?

50:51.821 --> 50:53.281
For a second.

50:59.746 --> 51:03.041
Even if she is telling
the truth, she's fucked.

51:03.500 --> 51:07.212
Would you mind letting me
talk to her first?

51:07.671 --> 51:09.839
Any leads I get,
they're all yours...

51:10.298 --> 51:12.676
but let me
get first crack at her.

51:13.134 --> 51:15.261
You want to talk to her alone?

51:15.720 --> 51:16.680
She's scared.

51:17.138 --> 51:19.140
You're intimidating her.
Big hotshot celebrity.

51:19.599 --> 51:21.726
I'm a nobody.
Maybe she'll open upwith me.

51:22.185 --> 51:23.478
Maybe she looks
at me different.

51:23.937 --> 51:26.398
What is this?
You're her saviour?

51:26.856 --> 51:28.900
Gonna save her
from the burning building?

51:29.359 --> 51:30.986
I'm being serious here.

51:37.200 --> 51:39.369
I'll give you a head start...

51:39.828 --> 51:40.745
but you get her
to the station house...

51:41.204 --> 51:42.080
and don't let her
out of your sight.

51:42.539 --> 51:43.873
She's the only warm body
we got left.

51:44.332 --> 51:46.209
I'm a professional,
all right?

51:46.668 --> 51:47.919
Women like that have a way...

51:48.378 --> 51:50.672
of turning professionals
into amateurs.

52:17.699 --> 52:19.242
What are you doing?

52:19.701 --> 52:21.619
I've got to light
this scene better.

52:22.078 --> 52:23.455
Make it more dramatic...

52:23.913 --> 52:26.583
just like in the movie,
"Silence of the Sheeps."

52:27.042 --> 52:28.626
Shut up.

52:29.085 --> 52:30.712
Hurts, huh?

52:41.973 --> 52:44.601
Big enough?
Just kidding.

52:45.060 --> 52:46.686
Want to get married?

52:50.065 --> 52:52.067
I love you.
You want to get married?

52:52.525 --> 52:53.526
Sweetheart.

52:53.985 --> 52:55.612
No?

52:57.197 --> 52:58.365
Come on.

52:59.741 --> 53:01.284
Come on.

53:17.801 --> 53:19.761
I love you.

53:21.054 --> 53:23.765
sweetheart, my love.

53:25.725 --> 53:27.769
I adore you.

53:29.145 --> 53:31.690
I adore you, my Nicolette.

53:33.817 --> 53:35.485
I want you.

53:44.411 --> 53:46.788
I adore you.

53:50.959 --> 53:52.335
She's here.

53:52.794 --> 53:54.421
She's here?

54:00.552 --> 54:02.554
What does that mean?

54:05.056 --> 54:06.266
"Good luck" in Greek.

54:06.725 --> 54:08.810
Good luck in English.

54:12.939 --> 54:14.566
Are you married?

54:16.818 --> 54:18.653
Do you live alone?

54:20.697 --> 54:22.615
I haven't showered
since the killings.

54:23.074 --> 54:25.493
We could stop at your place,
and I could take a shower...

54:25.952 --> 54:28.330
before we have to go back
to custody.

54:28.788 --> 54:30.790
Look, l...

54:31.249 --> 54:34.544
I can't take you
back to my place.

54:35.003 --> 54:36.755
Then somewhere else?

54:40.008 --> 54:41.634
How's it going, dude?

54:43.470 --> 54:46.139
-Eddie, how are you?
-Not too good.

54:57.734 --> 54:59.861
I love you.

55:00.278 --> 55:02.364
You have a funny way
of showing it.

55:02.822 --> 55:04.282
Yeah, me, too.

55:04.741 --> 55:05.909
Why'd you snap at me?

55:06.368 --> 55:07.327
I didn't snap at you.

55:07.786 --> 55:10.038
Yes,you did.
I just wanted a statement.

55:10.497 --> 55:11.414
I just can't answeryou
every time.

55:11.873 --> 55:13.041
I couldn't do it.

55:13.500 --> 55:16.419
Didn't have to embarrass me
infront of my colleagues.

55:16.878 --> 55:20.090
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to embarrass you.

55:20.548 --> 55:21.216
You know that.

55:21.675 --> 55:23.176
It's all right.

55:25.512 --> 55:27.138
You OK?

55:38.066 --> 55:41.569
You got blood all over
your watch. Leon's?

55:42.028 --> 55:44.197
Probably. It has to be.

55:46.908 --> 55:49.327
Is he gonna be all right?

55:49.786 --> 55:52.580
He'll be OK.

55:54.207 --> 55:56.167
Last week,you had
that schoolteacher's blood...

55:56.626 --> 55:58.586
on your shoes.

55:59.045 --> 56:02.173
I don't know how you do it.

56:05.301 --> 56:06.344
Speaking of shoes...

56:06.803 --> 56:09.139
you know what I was thinking?

56:11.057 --> 56:15.353
I would like to have...

56:19.149 --> 56:21.276
some shoes next to my shoes.

56:26.197 --> 56:27.407
Wait.

56:27.866 --> 56:29.784
What are you doing, Eddie?

56:50.221 --> 56:52.307
Forget the phone. What?

56:52.766 --> 56:54.225
No, go ahead.
Answer the phone.

56:54.684 --> 56:56.311
Aw, shit.

56:58.396 --> 56:59.981
Look, can I just
call you right back?

57:00.440 --> 57:01.733
You can't call me back.
We can't find Katie.

57:02.192 --> 57:04.319
We want you to anchor right now.
We don't know where she is.

57:04.778 --> 57:06.613
Come down, get in a cab,
and be here in an hour.

57:07.072 --> 57:08.531
Wait a minute.
Now? Right now?

57:08.990 --> 57:09.741
You want your shot?

57:10.200 --> 57:11.826
Get in the cab
and come down here now.

57:16.748 --> 57:18.083
They want me to anchor.

57:18.541 --> 57:20.085
-Great.
-Tonight.

57:20.543 --> 57:22.712
-That's great.
-Oh, my God.

57:25.715 --> 57:29.177
Forget that for a second.

57:29.636 --> 57:30.929
No,when you come back.

57:31.388 --> 57:32.514
You promise?
We'll talk tonight?

57:32.972 --> 57:34.182
Of course I promise.

57:34.641 --> 57:36.184
I'll see you
when you come back...

57:36.643 --> 57:37.268
and we'll do it.

57:37.727 --> 57:39.020
Go ahead.
You'll be great.

57:39.479 --> 57:40.647
I love you, Eddie.

57:41.106 --> 57:43.233
I love you, sweetheart.

57:47.028 --> 57:48.405
I'll see you tonight.

57:48.863 --> 57:51.241
Good luck.

57:51.700 --> 57:53.785
Don't be late.

58:32.824 --> 58:35.035
The video of Milos and Tamina...

58:35.493 --> 58:36.786
I told you to erase it.

58:37.245 --> 58:39.581
I erased everything.
It's all gone.

58:40.040 --> 58:42.834
Don't lie.
I won't be angry.

58:44.794 --> 58:47.088
Why not?

58:55.055 --> 58:57.265
-What is it?
-What does it look like?

58:57.724 --> 58:58.558
It's an address book.

58:59.017 --> 59:01.811
I took it from the black cop.

59:04.731 --> 59:06.066
What's this?

59:07.901 --> 59:09.944
What is it?

59:20.705 --> 59:25.251
"Eddie Flemming."

59:30.882 --> 59:33.885
Why won't you be angry
at me for keeping my movie?

59:37.806 --> 59:39.724
You'll see.

59:41.101 --> 59:43.770
Come. Bring the camera.

59:51.861 --> 59:53.071
Hello.

59:53.530 --> 59:57.575
My name is Frank Capra.
I'm a famous Hollywood director.

01:00:02.539 --> 01:00:04.207
There she is!

01:00:21.808 --> 01:00:23.226
What are you doing here?

01:00:23.685 --> 01:00:25.353
What am I doing here?

01:00:25.812 --> 01:00:27.772
I came to see how
the investigation is going.

01:00:28.231 --> 01:00:29.441
I called,
and you're not here.

01:00:29.899 --> 01:00:30.984
I waited by the station house,
you never show up.

01:00:31.443 --> 01:00:32.986
I beep you,
you don't return my call.

01:00:33.445 --> 01:00:36.614
Where the hell have you been?

01:00:37.073 --> 01:00:39.492
Ladder 21 was at the rock
for training. All right?

01:00:39.951 --> 01:00:41.661
So we stopped there so
she could get cleaned up.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.455
What do you mean cleaned up?

01:00:44.956 --> 01:00:45.915
I let her take a shower.

01:00:46.374 --> 01:00:49.169
A shower?
And did you take one, too?

01:00:49.627 --> 01:00:51.087
Come on, Chief.

01:00:51.546 --> 01:00:52.964
She's been through a lot.
I'm trying to help her out.

01:00:53.423 --> 01:00:54.257
Really?
That's really nice of you.

01:00:54.716 --> 01:00:55.675
You take a homicide witness...

01:00:56.134 --> 01:00:57.677
to take a shower after
your partner's been shot.

01:00:58.136 --> 01:00:59.721
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.514
You having that much trouble
get ting dates?

01:01:01.973 --> 01:01:03.767
I told him to.
Tommy, get her out of here.

01:01:04.225 --> 01:01:05.560
There was the press
all over the place.

01:01:06.019 --> 01:01:07.479
I didn't want her face
in the news, so I told him...

01:01:07.937 --> 01:01:09.147
to take her someplace quiet
till things calmed down.

01:01:09.606 --> 01:01:11.733
-Really?
-It was my decision, not his.

01:01:12.192 --> 01:01:13.526
I am
the Deputy Chief Fire Marshal...

01:01:13.985 --> 01:01:16.154
and every now and then, I like
to be included in decisions.

01:01:16.613 --> 01:01:18.198
I understand.
Infact, once he briefs me...

01:01:18.657 --> 01:01:20.200
you guys can take over
the press conference...

01:01:20.659 --> 01:01:21.785
and you can take
the lead in the case.

01:01:22.243 --> 01:01:24.120
-How's that?
-All right.

01:01:24.579 --> 01:01:26.623
I'm ready to be briefed.

01:01:28.208 --> 01:01:29.793
-Excuse us.
-Sure.

01:01:30.251 --> 01:01:32.087
Are you ready to brief me?

01:01:32.545 --> 01:01:34.255
Good.

01:01:37.217 --> 01:01:39.177
Wait.

01:01:42.972 --> 01:01:44.808
Fellas, can you give us
a few minutes, please?

01:01:45.266 --> 01:01:47.310
-You bet.
-Thanks.

01:01:48.728 --> 01:01:49.562
Shut that door, too,
when you go out.

01:01:50.021 --> 01:01:51.648
Thanks a lot, guys.

01:01:53.066 --> 01:01:55.235
Just so you know,
I didn't touch her.

01:01:55.694 --> 01:01:56.861
Maybe you should've...

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.488
because nobody believes
you didn't, including me.

01:01:58.947 --> 01:02:00.073
I know it wasn't
the smartest thing to do...

01:02:00.532 --> 01:02:01.700
and you think I'm a fool,
but nothing happened.

01:02:02.158 --> 01:02:03.284
It wasn't
the smartest thing to do.

01:02:03.743 --> 01:02:05.537
To say the least,
you ought to know better.

01:02:05.996 --> 01:02:08.498
She's got the potential
to fucking hang you.

01:02:08.957 --> 01:02:10.583
If she even suggests
that you made a pass at her...

01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:11.918
it's fucking over.
Deny it all you want.

01:02:12.377 --> 01:02:13.837
It won't make a fucking
bit of difference.

01:02:14.295 --> 01:02:17.090
You never went
out on a limb for somebody?

01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:18.967
"Here's the name of
an immigration lawyer."

01:02:19.426 --> 01:02:20.677
That's how you go out on a limb.

01:02:21.136 --> 01:02:22.178
If you heard her story,
you'd believe her, too.

01:02:22.637 --> 01:02:24.597
You'll jeopardize
your career and your life...

01:02:25.056 --> 01:02:26.516
and my case...

01:02:26.975 --> 01:02:28.643
and I'll give you
another piece of advice.

01:02:29.102 --> 01:02:29.978
Maybe you don't watch TV...

01:02:30.437 --> 01:02:32.188
but I'll let you in
on a little secret.

01:02:32.647 --> 01:02:34.149
The whole fucking world
watches television.

01:02:34.607 --> 01:02:36.568
When you go out there,
they know your face...

01:02:37.027 --> 01:02:39.571
and the little fucking
itty bit of fame...

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:42.615
I have in this fucking city
makes my job a lot easier...

01:02:43.074 --> 01:02:45.076
and I get a lot more done
because of it.

01:02:45.535 --> 01:02:47.620
Why'd you stand up
for me with the chief?

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.669
I don't know.

01:02:55.128 --> 01:02:57.047
You remind me of a puppy
I used to have...

01:02:57.505 --> 01:03:00.675
who pissed all over the carpet,
but I still kept him.

01:03:17.567 --> 01:03:19.486
-Let's go.
-Captain!

01:03:21.363 --> 01:03:23.281
One at a time, please!

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:27.452
We're looking for two male white
suspects in their thirties.

01:03:27.911 --> 01:03:30.914
We believe them to be of
an Eastern-European nationality.

01:03:34.584 --> 01:03:35.877
That's another lesson.

01:03:36.336 --> 01:03:38.755
You got nothing to say,
don't waste their time or yours.

01:03:39.214 --> 01:03:40.882
Let somebody else do that.

01:03:41.341 --> 01:03:42.550
What's the plan now?

01:03:43.009 --> 01:03:45.011
You're on the team, so I'll
call you when something happens.

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:47.138
Right now I've got to propose
to my girlfriend.

01:03:47.597 --> 01:03:49.891
Really? Congratulations.

01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:52.811
Don't congratulate me.
She hasn't said yes yet.

01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:54.813
I still think
there's something...

01:03:55.271 --> 01:03:57.482
I could be doing
to helpfind these guys.

01:03:57.941 --> 01:04:00.402
Go home and get some rest.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.028
Sometimes you can try too hard.

01:04:02.487 --> 01:04:04.531
Sometimes you have to go away
in order to come back.

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:06.658
Like you did
with that shot today?

01:04:07.117 --> 01:04:07.909
That's right.

01:04:08.368 --> 01:04:09.744
All right. I get it.

01:04:10.203 --> 01:04:12.205
Good, because you don't
look like you get it.

01:04:12.664 --> 01:04:13.707
I get it.

01:04:14.165 --> 01:04:15.709
-Sure you get it?
-I get it.

01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:17.711
-You get it?
-No, I get it.

01:04:18.169 --> 01:04:21.506
Trust me. I get it.

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:25.051
Why don't you keep it?

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:28.304
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

01:05:51.346 --> 01:05:52.973
Coming.

01:06:11.533 --> 01:06:13.159
Hello?

01:06:54.951 --> 01:06:56.411
I'm looking for Gayle Cassiopi.

01:06:58.246 --> 01:06:59.873
I think it's one flight up.

01:07:00.332 --> 01:07:02.459
Thanks.

01:07:11.343 --> 01:07:12.969
Action.

01:08:09.317 --> 01:08:10.360
Who's she?

01:08:10.819 --> 01:08:12.904
None of your fucking business.

01:08:17.242 --> 01:08:18.993
Who's Nicky?

01:08:32.674 --> 01:08:33.841
Beautiful.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.926
It's OK.

01:08:45.145 --> 01:08:48.231
You know what I need?
I need your opinion.

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:50.567
You do? About what?

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:56.740
You see...

01:08:57.198 --> 01:09:00.702
they're going to make
a movie about me, too, Eddie...

01:09:01.161 --> 01:09:02.620
and write books.

01:09:03.078 --> 01:09:05.832
Write books.

01:09:07.334 --> 01:09:10.170
Books? What's your fucking
accomplishment?

01:09:12.339 --> 01:09:16.676
I kill someone famous.

01:09:18.428 --> 01:09:26.394
And I saw you on the page
of "People" magazine.

01:09:26.853 --> 01:09:28.270
Eddie, look at me.

01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:31.858
Good.

01:09:32.317 --> 01:09:35.194
Good. Be tough to the end.

01:09:35.654 --> 01:09:38.782
Actor who plays you will
want you to die like a hero.

01:09:41.117 --> 01:09:44.203
Tabloids don't have
to do re-enactments.

01:09:44.662 --> 01:09:48.375
They're going to have
a real movie this time.

01:09:48.832 --> 01:09:51.502
You film killing me,
you'll get away with that?

01:09:53.462 --> 01:09:54.714
You're stupider than I thought.

01:09:55.173 --> 01:09:57.384
Both out of your fucking minds.

01:10:01.596 --> 01:10:05.016
Turn it off!

01:10:11.314 --> 01:10:12.941
We are insane.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.154
Who else but crazy men
would film their crimes?

01:10:18.613 --> 01:10:22.450
So I kill you,
and if we are caught...

01:10:22.909 --> 01:10:24.327
we are sent
to mental hospital...

01:10:24.786 --> 01:10:29.332
but once I'm in the hospital,
I say I'm not crazy...

01:10:29.791 --> 01:10:31.835
just pretending.

01:10:32.293 --> 01:10:34.879
So I would be acquitted.

01:10:35.338 --> 01:10:37.090
We see psychiatrists.

01:10:37.549 --> 01:10:40.051
They must certify we are sane...

01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:43.179
and because of
your double jeopardy law...

01:10:43.638 --> 01:10:46.016
we can't be tried
for the same crime twice.

01:10:46.474 --> 01:10:50.353
We come out
free, rich, and famous.

01:10:50.812 --> 01:10:54.232
This is a fucking great idea.

01:10:54.691 --> 01:10:56.526
You think the jury
will buy that bullshit?

01:10:56.985 --> 01:10:58.820
You sickfucks.

01:11:16.546 --> 01:11:19.341
I'm smarter than Americans.

01:11:20.842 --> 01:11:24.095
You watch crybaby talk shows
all day long.

01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:32.270
Not only will Americans
believe me, they'll cry for me.

01:11:41.154 --> 01:11:45.450
Would you like to say
good-bye to your Nicky?

01:11:45.909 --> 01:11:49.496
Maybe you can
propose to her now.

01:11:56.419 --> 01:11:59.089
He has nothing to say.

01:11:59.547 --> 01:12:00.840
Give me a pillow.

01:12:02.509 --> 01:12:04.469
Give me a fucking pillow!

01:12:10.558 --> 01:12:12.352
Come here, start the camera.

01:12:12.811 --> 01:12:15.355
Cut!
This is my project.

01:12:15.814 --> 01:12:18.108
I'm the director,
and I say action.

01:12:18.566 --> 01:12:20.235
Shut the fuck up!

01:14:16.977 --> 01:14:17.978
Detective Flemming...

01:14:18.436 --> 01:14:20.855
was one of the most
decorated NYPD detectives...

01:14:21.314 --> 01:14:22.607
in the history of New York.

01:14:23.066 --> 01:14:24.901
Among the several thousand
arrests he made...

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.029
during his career,
the famed Stephen Geller case.

01:14:28.488 --> 01:14:30.657
He was widely loved
by the community he served.

01:14:31.116 --> 01:14:32.701
His partner eulogized him.

01:14:33.159 --> 01:14:34.744
Eddie was my mentor...

01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:38.581
My partner...

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.460
Tragedy.
Every great film must have one.

01:14:42.919 --> 01:14:44.963
...the word "friend."

01:14:46.923 --> 01:14:49.009
I will miss him.

01:15:14.034 --> 01:15:15.160
I said, no!

01:15:15.618 --> 01:15:18.038
No means no.
Want me to get ugly?

01:15:18.496 --> 01:15:20.332
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
It's a private affair.

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:23.335
-Sorry, no.
-Let me get a drink.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.806
Please hold.

01:17:00.265 --> 01:17:03.518
Just stay on. Hold on.
Robert, you've got a call.

01:17:03.977 --> 01:17:05.186
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:17:05.645 --> 01:17:07.480
Hold on. I'm right here.
Just stay right there.

01:17:07.939 --> 01:17:08.857
Don't be ridiculous.
Can't you see I'm busy here?

01:17:09.316 --> 01:17:10.567
Trust me. Take this call.

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:12.027
Hang up the phone,
go get yourself a drink.

01:17:12.485 --> 01:17:14.404
Take the call.

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:16.364
Give it to me.

01:17:17.824 --> 01:17:19.451
I'm sorry.

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:23.455
Who is this?

01:17:23.913 --> 01:17:27.208
I made a movie
of Eddie Flemming's murder.

01:17:31.421 --> 01:17:32.756
How do I know this is you?

01:17:33.214 --> 01:17:34.466
You'll know when you meet me.

01:17:34.924 --> 01:17:38.011
-Where?
-Come to 35th and Broadway.

01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:39.929
Don't bring the police.
Come alone...

01:17:40.388 --> 01:17:41.598
oryou'll be in my next film.

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:44.601
Listen, asshole, I've been
threatened by better than you.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.228
No. I'm the best
that's ever threatened you.

01:17:47.687 --> 01:17:48.813
They're gonna get you.

01:17:49.272 --> 01:17:52.150
We'll talk about that.

01:17:52.609 --> 01:17:53.777
About surrendering?

01:17:54.235 --> 01:17:57.155
4.00. It gives you
time to go to bank.

01:17:57.614 --> 01:18:00.158
$1 million.

01:18:03.328 --> 01:18:05.872
"Top Story,"
are you still there?

01:18:06.331 --> 01:18:07.415
I'm here.

01:18:07.874 --> 01:18:09.167
It doesn't work that way.

01:18:09.626 --> 01:18:11.503
If you don't want my film...

01:18:11.961 --> 01:18:15.882
I'll call another show,
and they will show it.

01:18:21.972 --> 01:18:23.473
I'll meet you.
I need two things from you--

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:27.394
I want exclusivity,
and you will surrender to me.

01:18:30.146 --> 01:18:31.648
Bring cash.

01:18:38.154 --> 01:18:39.990
Let's go.

01:18:44.327 --> 01:18:46.705
Truck 21 spotted on
the north end of the building...

01:18:47.163 --> 01:18:48.707
put the aerial ladder
up to the roof.

01:18:49.165 --> 01:18:51.292
Engine company 54
and Engine 9...

01:18:51.751 --> 01:18:53.878
took hand lines
up to the second level.

01:18:54.337 --> 01:18:56.923
The they cut a hole in the roof
directly over the fire.

01:18:57.382 --> 01:19:00.218
-So how was the funeral?
-Not good.

01:19:00.677 --> 01:19:02.637
Did the D.A.
video-tape her deposition?

01:19:03.096 --> 01:19:04.431
He finished a little while ago.

01:19:04.889 --> 01:19:06.016
Swing by her apartment...

01:19:06.474 --> 01:19:08.310
pick up her clothes,
and take her straight to INS.

01:19:08.768 --> 01:19:10.687
She's their problem now.

01:19:48.016 --> 01:19:51.102
Hard to believe. Watch.

01:20:39.442 --> 01:20:40.276
What's this?

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:41.987
I don't know.

01:20:44.364 --> 01:20:45.699
"Good luck with
all your troubles.

01:20:46.157 --> 01:20:48.827
"I'm here if you need me.
Ludwig."

01:20:51.538 --> 01:20:52.831
Who's he?

01:20:53.289 --> 01:20:57.168
My boss.
Why, are you jealous?

01:20:59.546 --> 01:21:01.840
Why don'twe get your stuff?

01:21:29.576 --> 01:21:31.703
Look...

01:21:32.162 --> 01:21:34.873
you're a witness
to a double homicide.

01:21:35.332 --> 01:21:37.667
All right?
I can't get involved with you.

01:21:41.087 --> 01:21:42.881
All right?

01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:47.385
Why don't you go get your bags,
and I'll wait here.

01:21:47.844 --> 01:21:49.763
Are you all right?

01:21:50.221 --> 01:21:52.807
I'm fine.

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.283
Get back!

01:22:14.037 --> 01:22:15.413
That's not mine!

01:22:25.215 --> 01:22:26.800
Get back!

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:34.307
Don't do it!

01:22:37.769 --> 01:22:39.562
Come on!

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:45.276
Hurry!

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:52.325
-It's locked.
-Where's the key?

01:22:52.784 --> 01:22:53.785
-It's not mine.
-All right.

01:22:54.244 --> 01:22:55.620
Get in the bathroom.

01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:02.335
1075. 47th and 8th!

01:23:02.794 --> 01:23:04.963
All right. We're trapped!
Two alarms on arrival!

01:23:07.132 --> 01:23:09.301
Oh, my God.

01:23:09.759 --> 01:23:11.636
He's nailed it down.

01:23:12.095 --> 01:23:14.973
Baby, don't open the window.
It'll suck the fire towards us.

01:23:21.438 --> 01:23:24.316
-They were here.
-Jesus Christ, that's Eddie's.

01:23:24.774 --> 01:23:26.151
They were here!

01:23:26.609 --> 01:23:29.612
Calm down, Daphne.
Just get in the tub.

01:23:30.989 --> 01:23:32.240
-There's gasoline.
-What?

01:23:32.699 --> 01:23:33.908
There's gasoline in here.

01:23:34.367 --> 01:23:36.536
-What are you doing?
-I'm pouring it out.

01:23:36.995 --> 01:23:38.997
-It's not going down.
-Oh, my God.

01:23:42.792 --> 01:23:44.127
Give it to me.

01:23:45.628 --> 01:23:46.921
Jesus Christ.
It's clogged. God damn it.

01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.466
Please do something.
We're going to die.

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:52.427
Forget it.
They're all clogged.

01:23:52.886 --> 01:23:56.765
Come on, baby.
Just stay low and stay calm.

01:24:29.297 --> 01:24:32.884
90% people who die in a fire
die from eating smoke.

01:24:33.343 --> 01:24:35.470
Let me introduce you
to my partner...

01:24:35.929 --> 01:24:38.306
and the man
who started the fire.

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:45.105
Say something for your fans.

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:52.529
Stand back and get down!
Just get back and stay low.

01:24:55.115 --> 01:24:56.866
Stay low!

01:25:08.086 --> 01:25:10.380
This'll buy us some time!

01:25:27.897 --> 01:25:30.358
Get back!

01:25:35.655 --> 01:25:36.948
This is a great film.

01:25:37.407 --> 01:25:41.244
We can see fire right now,
and Daphne's in the fire.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.462
Tell him it's OK.

01:25:57.344 --> 01:25:58.762
Let's go!

01:26:19.115 --> 01:26:20.742
Come on, guys. Let's go.

01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:23.328
Get that plug now!

01:26:38.051 --> 01:26:39.803
Take care of the boy.

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:43.556
And get her some oxygen!

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:51.690
You all right?
What the hell happened up there?

01:26:52.148 --> 01:26:54.693
It was a setup. Somebody
booby-trapped the apartment.

01:26:55.151 --> 01:26:57.362
-Who?
-It's gotta be the same guys.

01:26:57.821 --> 01:27:00.240
You gotta speak louder.
I can't hearyou.

01:27:00.699 --> 01:27:01.908
Jordy, are you hurt?

01:27:02.367 --> 01:27:03.243
-I'm all right.
-What?

01:27:03.702 --> 01:27:05.954
You have to speak up.

01:27:06.413 --> 01:27:08.790
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:27:09.249 --> 01:27:12.002
What is it?

01:27:21.553 --> 01:27:22.554
We have a disturbance
in the lobby.

01:27:23.013 --> 01:27:24.472
-Where's Hawkins?
-He's not on the premises.

01:27:24.931 --> 01:27:27.183
Go get that tape
and bring it here right now.

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:28.810
Any request for that
video-tape has to go to--

01:27:29.269 --> 01:27:32.230
Woman, I am begging you!
You can't let this happen!

01:27:32.689 --> 01:27:34.065
You want that tape,
contact the at torney.

01:27:34.524 --> 01:27:35.150
I'll be happy to give you--

01:27:35.608 --> 01:27:37.068
You thinkwe're joking?

01:27:39.446 --> 01:27:42.240
Listen,you can't do this!
Don't do this to Eddie.

01:27:42.699 --> 01:27:44.159
Don't do it to
the people of this city.

01:27:44.617 --> 01:27:46.119
You can't show
the man's murder on TV!

01:27:46.578 --> 01:27:49.039
You want the tape, there it is!

01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:53.918
Stay tuned for a special edition
of "Top Story."

01:27:54.377 --> 01:27:55.670
Detective Eddie Flemming's
brutal murder...

01:27:56.129 --> 01:27:58.923
has been video-taped,
and we will broadcast it...

01:27:59.382 --> 01:28:00.800
after these messages.

01:28:01.259 --> 01:28:03.678
Hard to believe. Watch.

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.661
Who says you can't be
success in America?

01:28:28.119 --> 01:28:32.874
I came here with nothing,
knowing nobody, and now, look.

01:28:34.876 --> 01:28:36.336
I am success story.

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:44.177
Why did you say "I"?

01:28:44.636 --> 01:28:46.638
-It should be "we."
-Don't be paranoid.

01:28:47.097 --> 01:28:48.640
I gave you half of
what they gave me.

01:28:49.099 --> 01:28:49.933
Good evening.
I'm Robert Hawkins...

01:28:50.392 --> 01:28:51.267
and this is "Top Story."

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:53.353
-Here we are.
-Tonight I present to you...

01:28:53.812 --> 01:28:55.230
material of a graphic
and violent nature...

01:28:55.689 --> 01:28:57.899
never before seen
on television...

01:28:58.358 --> 01:29:00.777
and I do so with a heavy heart.

01:29:01.236 --> 01:29:02.320
It would only be normal
to askwhy.

01:29:02.779 --> 01:29:04.823
Why are we showing something
so disturbing?

01:29:05.281 --> 01:29:07.617
And my answer
is as a journalist...

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:09.577
I am obligated to show it.

01:29:10.036 --> 01:29:12.580
I air this tape
in loving memory...

01:29:13.039 --> 01:29:14.332
of my friend Eddie Flemming.

01:29:14.791 --> 01:29:17.460
Hard to believe.

01:29:19.963 --> 01:29:21.047
Watch.

01:29:21.506 --> 01:29:26.219
You film killing me,
you're gonna get away with that?

01:29:26.678 --> 01:29:28.555
Just turn it off.

01:29:29.014 --> 01:29:30.890
Cut! This is my project.

01:29:31.349 --> 01:29:33.560
I'm the director,
and I say action.

01:29:34.019 --> 01:29:35.562
Shut the [beep] up!

01:30:10.847 --> 01:30:12.807
Why did you leave that stuff in
about you being a director?

01:30:13.266 --> 01:30:15.310
-Because I am the director.
-What?

01:30:15.769 --> 01:30:17.479
Don't you fucking realize
if it wasn't for me...

01:30:17.937 --> 01:30:22.233
for my idea, no fucking way
we'd be sitting here right now?

01:30:22.692 --> 01:30:24.611
-Your idea?
-My idea.

01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:26.863
Is that the guy?

01:30:28.281 --> 01:30:29.324
Don't you understand?

01:30:29.783 --> 01:30:32.118
This is a greatAmerican movie,
and who made it?

01:30:32.577 --> 01:30:34.037
I made it all.
I was the director.

01:30:34.496 --> 01:30:36.289
-Who are you?
-Everything.

01:30:36.748 --> 01:30:38.625
I am everything.

01:30:39.084 --> 01:30:40.710
This is whatAmerica wants--
violence and sex.

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:43.630
Before we hand in
the nextvideo...

01:30:44.089 --> 01:30:45.882
I'm gonna put titles on it...

01:30:46.341 --> 01:30:50.553
and my credit is going to read,
"Directed by Oleg Razgul."

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:53.723
Yeah, but there is
only one problem.

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:56.643
One credit,
but I don't share credit.

01:30:57.102 --> 01:30:58.979
-You got it?
-Share credit?

01:30:59.437 --> 01:31:00.897
You think you're a director?

01:31:01.356 --> 01:31:07.404
You're just a little,
small, Russian piece of shit.

01:31:10.407 --> 01:31:11.741
Let's go!

01:31:23.795 --> 01:31:25.755
This is Robert Hawkins
for "Top Story."

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:28.675
We'll be back after this.

01:31:29.134 --> 01:31:31.219
All right, I'm here.
Oh,Jesus.

01:31:31.678 --> 01:31:33.096
This is the man
I told you about.

01:31:33.555 --> 01:31:35.724
This is Bruce Cutler.

01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.101
Bryan, come get this from here.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:41.521
I am Emil. I'm insane.

01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:43.690
Are you my lawyer?

01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:45.108
Not just yet.

01:31:45.567 --> 01:31:47.610
I got your money.

01:31:53.408 --> 01:31:54.993
Where is it?

01:31:55.452 --> 01:31:57.454
Shit,where is it?

01:31:57.912 --> 01:31:58.830
Where is it?!

01:31:59.289 --> 01:32:01.124
He's got the camera!
He's got the movie!

01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:02.459
Let's sit down
and talk a minute.

01:32:02.917 --> 01:32:04.336
I need it! Where is it?

01:32:04.794 --> 01:32:05.503
Don't move!

01:32:05.962 --> 01:32:08.048
Get your hands up
and drop the gun!

01:32:08.506 --> 01:32:10.342
Drop the goddamn gun!

01:32:12.844 --> 01:32:14.012
What did you hit him for?
He surrendered!

01:32:14.471 --> 01:32:16.723
-Go tight on them.
-He's unarmed and hurt!

01:32:17.182 --> 01:32:18.141
I'm going with you.

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:19.559
Come on!

01:32:20.018 --> 01:32:21.186
I'm coming down there with you.

01:32:21.645 --> 01:32:22.604
I'm his lawyer--

01:32:23.063 --> 01:32:24.064
Turn the camera off!

01:32:24.522 --> 01:32:27.275
Keep going! Keepfilming!

01:32:27.734 --> 01:32:29.527
I'm invoking his rights!

01:32:29.986 --> 01:32:30.820
What's going on?

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:32.113
I'm going with you.

01:32:32.572 --> 01:32:33.823
Fuck!

01:32:34.282 --> 01:32:35.325
I'm going down there with you.

01:32:35.784 --> 01:32:36.951
What's going on?!

01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:38.703
They're taking you downtown.

01:32:39.162 --> 01:32:41.373
-Whoa! I'll take him.
-He's mine!

01:32:41.831 --> 01:32:42.666
I'm taking him.
Don't argue with me.

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:44.751
-He's my collar!
-He killed my partner!

01:32:45.210 --> 01:32:47.003
After he's booked, he's yours,
but I'm walking him in!

01:32:47.462 --> 01:32:49.422
All right, kid,
have your 15 minutes.

01:32:49.881 --> 01:32:53.134
Tommy, ride with him.
Get in the fucking car.

01:32:53.593 --> 01:32:55.303
Don't speak to him!

01:32:56.972 --> 01:32:57.889
Put your head in!

01:32:58.348 --> 01:32:59.474
Get him in the car, Tommy!

01:32:59.933 --> 01:33:01.434
Put your head in,you fool!

01:33:01.893 --> 01:33:03.353
I ain't playing with you!
Shit!

01:33:03.812 --> 01:33:06.648
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

01:33:07.107 --> 01:33:08.358
Bullshit, Leon!

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:11.236
Ashamed of what?
I got him off the streets.

01:33:11.695 --> 01:33:12.779
Bravo, Mr Hawkins!

01:33:13.238 --> 01:33:14.990
You better back off.

01:33:15.448 --> 01:33:16.533
You are sick!

01:33:16.992 --> 01:33:17.993
I'm fed up with your bullshit!

01:33:18.451 --> 01:33:20.161
Let go!

01:33:23.581 --> 01:33:25.291
Get outta here!

01:33:29.671 --> 01:33:33.216
Where are you going?
You'll lose everybody!

01:33:33.675 --> 01:33:35.218
What are you doing, man?

01:33:35.677 --> 01:33:37.012
This is not the way
to the station!

01:33:50.358 --> 01:33:51.985
Talk to me!
You're losing them!

01:33:52.444 --> 01:33:54.070
Answer me, man!

01:34:21.556 --> 01:34:23.099
-Answer me!
-Where am l?

01:34:23.558 --> 01:34:26.061
-What the hell--
-What's going on?

01:34:26.519 --> 01:34:29.022
Hold on. Wait!

01:34:29.481 --> 01:34:30.649
Come on!

01:34:31.107 --> 01:34:33.276
Where's my lawyer?
Where are they?

01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:35.111
God damn it!

01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:38.114
What's wrong with you, man?
Shit!

01:34:38.573 --> 01:34:40.909
Fuck you!
What's going on?

01:34:41.368 --> 01:34:43.453
Jordy, listen!
Wait a minute!

01:34:43.912 --> 01:34:45.163
You can't do this, man!

01:34:45.622 --> 01:34:47.540
Listen! Wait,Jordy!

01:34:50.126 --> 01:34:50.835
Come on.

01:34:51.294 --> 01:34:52.545
Listen, man, please!

01:34:53.004 --> 01:34:57.634
How'd you know how to rig
that apartment?

01:34:58.093 --> 01:34:59.928
My father was a fireman.

01:35:00.387 --> 01:35:02.931
He taught me about fire.
Now it's my friend.

01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:05.016
-Take a walk.
-You're not thinking straight.

01:35:05.475 --> 01:35:06.685
Don't you get it?
He knew he'd get caught.

01:35:07.143 --> 01:35:08.436
That's why you video-taped
Eddie's murder!

01:35:08.895 --> 01:35:10.522
I want to see
this son of a bitch dead, too--

01:35:10.981 --> 01:35:12.107
It's over tonight,
you son of a bitch!

01:35:12.565 --> 01:35:13.400
You can't kill him
in cold blood!

01:35:13.858 --> 01:35:14.943
Get the hell outta here!

01:35:15.402 --> 01:35:16.361
Get in the car!

01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.490
Listen to me!
I'm not gonna let you do this!

01:35:20.949 --> 01:35:23.118
Get in the car! Go!

01:35:23.576 --> 01:35:24.536
Now go!

01:35:24.995 --> 01:35:27.872
Fuck it, man! Shit!

01:35:28.331 --> 01:35:30.333
Something fucking funny?

01:35:30.792 --> 01:35:32.252
Refreshing.

01:35:32.711 --> 01:35:34.963
You think this is funny?!

01:35:35.422 --> 01:35:36.965
Turn around!

01:35:37.424 --> 01:35:40.468
You want to be famous?
You want headlines?

01:35:42.095 --> 01:35:43.471
Now's your chance.

01:35:43.930 --> 01:35:45.056
Put your hands up.

01:35:45.515 --> 01:35:47.684
Get your goddamn hands up!

01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:51.271
Turn around.

01:35:51.730 --> 01:35:53.523
You want to be
a real American, right?

01:35:53.982 --> 01:35:54.733
You want to be a tough guy?

01:35:55.191 --> 01:35:58.528
Here's Eddie's gun.
You remember him?

01:36:04.451 --> 01:36:05.285
Come on.

01:36:05.744 --> 01:36:07.537
You want to be famous?
Shoot me.

01:36:07.996 --> 01:36:09.539
Want headlines?
Want to make money?

01:36:09.998 --> 01:36:12.167
Want to be a celebrity?
Shoot me!

01:36:14.377 --> 01:36:17.839
You can't kill me.
You're not a cop.

01:36:18.298 --> 01:36:20.300
You're just a fireman
with a gun.

01:36:23.219 --> 01:36:27.182
OK...l'll make it easy.

01:36:43.907 --> 01:36:50.997
You Americans are pussies
without your missiles and money.

01:36:51.456 --> 01:36:54.751
You won't kill me.

01:36:55.210 --> 01:36:57.462
You don't have the balls.

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.315
Don't do it, brother!

01:37:17.774 --> 01:37:19.693
Kill me.

01:37:20.151 --> 01:37:21.820
Get up!

01:37:22.278 --> 01:37:24.364
You are mine now, sucker!

01:37:24.823 --> 01:37:26.324
You are out of control,
you know that?

01:37:26.783 --> 01:37:28.660
Here's Eddie's gun.

01:37:30.370 --> 01:37:32.539
Where you going?

01:37:32.998 --> 01:37:35.792
I lost my shoe.
I want my shoe.

01:37:36.251 --> 01:37:38.211
Get him out of here!

01:37:43.883 --> 01:37:47.554
Emil Slovak is a victim here.
He is not a culprit.

01:37:48.013 --> 01:37:49.097
We all appreciate the tragedy...

01:37:49.556 --> 01:37:51.349
of the death
of Detective Flemming.

01:37:51.808 --> 01:37:53.226
I represent Mr Slovak.

01:37:53.685 --> 01:37:56.896
He was operating under the undue
influence of his partner.

01:37:57.355 --> 01:37:58.982
This will all come out
at the trial...

01:37:59.441 --> 01:38:01.860
and Emil will be vindicated.
I will see to that.

01:38:04.738 --> 01:38:06.573
-Good job.
-Thanks.

01:38:07.032 --> 01:38:08.742
How you feeling?

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:10.535
I brought letters.

01:38:10.994 --> 01:38:12.620
Fan mail from women.

01:38:13.079 --> 01:38:14.164
One wants to buy you a suit...

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:17.125
another one sent money,
and another one wants money.

01:38:17.584 --> 01:38:19.544
-Bring me the cigarettes?
-I did.

01:38:21.421 --> 01:38:25.258
The perception out there
is very bad, Emil, right now.

01:38:25.717 --> 01:38:26.926
And perception is reality.

01:38:27.385 --> 01:38:28.637
You may not be crazy...

01:38:29.095 --> 01:38:30.138
but I want to get
that message out...

01:38:30.597 --> 01:38:31.973
and I want to get it out now.

01:38:32.432 --> 01:38:34.017
That's our only defence
in this case.

01:38:34.476 --> 01:38:36.770
You have tofocus
on three things--

01:38:37.228 --> 01:38:39.064
paranoia,fear, and delusions.

01:38:39.522 --> 01:38:40.732
I was all of those.

01:38:41.191 --> 01:38:44.653
But you never appreciated
the severity of it until now.

01:38:45.111 --> 01:38:45.987
Of course not.
How could I be?

01:38:46.446 --> 01:38:49.324
I was paranoid,
fear ful, and deluded.

01:38:52.661 --> 01:38:54.287
Now...what about Oleg?

01:38:54.746 --> 01:38:56.623
They're looking
all over for him.

01:38:57.082 --> 01:38:59.542
Haven't found him.
Maybe he went back to Russia.

01:39:00.001 --> 01:39:01.419
I don't know.

01:39:01.878 --> 01:39:02.671
He's here.

01:39:03.129 --> 01:39:04.297
Let'sforget about him
and focus on you.

01:39:04.756 --> 01:39:06.549
You're what's most important.

01:39:07.008 --> 01:39:11.012
What about my movie rights?
Book rights?

01:39:11.471 --> 01:39:13.056
Foryou?

01:39:13.515 --> 01:39:16.768
I have not thought
about that, Emil.

01:39:17.227 --> 01:39:19.813
How much do you want?
What's your cut?

01:39:21.314 --> 01:39:24.985
I thinkwe could be partners.
50-50.

01:39:25.443 --> 01:39:27.070
No way.

01:39:27.529 --> 01:39:28.822
I give you 30%, no more.

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.448
Don't forget.
We're in it together.

01:39:30.907 --> 01:39:32.200
I thought 40%
might be all right.

01:39:32.659 --> 01:39:34.327
Oh, my God!

01:39:34.786 --> 01:39:36.788
Thirty,
or I call another lawyer.

01:39:37.247 --> 01:39:38.748
This is the biggest
case of your life.

01:39:39.207 --> 01:39:42.335
Don't try to negotiate.
Say yes or no.

01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:50.302
I can live with 30%,
but, Emil, it's important...

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:53.179
you understand
this is not all about money.

01:39:53.638 --> 01:39:54.806
What else do you need?

01:39:55.265 --> 01:39:58.727
I need to know about you,
what makes you tick.

01:39:59.185 --> 01:40:00.729
I need to know
about your background.

01:40:01.187 --> 01:40:02.605
I need to know about
your mother,your father...

01:40:03.064 --> 01:40:03.982
your brother,your sister,
everything.

01:40:04.441 --> 01:40:06.985
That's what I need to know.

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:11.489
My father always degraded me.

01:40:11.948 --> 01:40:12.949
He killed my self-esteem.

01:40:13.408 --> 01:40:17.162
He hated me from the day
when I was born.

01:40:21.666 --> 01:40:24.210
Emil Slovak
will appear in court today.

01:40:24.669 --> 01:40:25.879
His lawyer--

01:40:26.338 --> 01:40:28.381
Stay focused. Start again.

01:40:29.966 --> 01:40:32.385
Emil Slovak
will appear in court today.

01:40:32.844 --> 01:40:37.474
His lawyer will argue that
his client is mentally unfit...

01:40:37.932 --> 01:40:39.392
This is such bullshit.

01:40:39.851 --> 01:40:43.813
In a related matter, Mr Slovak's
attorney Bruce Cutler...

01:40:44.272 --> 01:40:47.275
famous for handling
sensational cases...

01:40:47.734 --> 01:40:50.278
claims his client is
unfit to stand trial.

01:40:50.737 --> 01:40:53.573
Bobby,want to give me
a break already?

01:40:54.032 --> 01:40:56.159
Hello?
No, not you, hon.

01:40:56.618 --> 01:40:58.787
Hello? No,
we have no comment.

01:40:59.245 --> 01:41:01.748
...his partner Oleg Razgul,
who threatened to kill him...

01:41:02.207 --> 01:41:03.166
if he didn't follow his orders.

01:41:03.625 --> 01:41:06.127
I gotta go!

01:41:06.586 --> 01:41:08.546
I'm going back to
the Czech Republic...

01:41:09.005 --> 01:41:10.340
toface the charges against me.

01:41:10.799 --> 01:41:12.008
I'm innocent.

01:41:12.467 --> 01:41:13.969
If she shot a cop
who raped her sister...

01:41:14.427 --> 01:41:16.638
in this country,
she'd be a hero.

01:41:18.014 --> 01:41:19.349
And I approached him
and asked him...

01:41:19.808 --> 01:41:21.434
for some spare change.
Politely, right?

01:41:21.893 --> 01:41:24.354
Whereupon he pulls out
his big gun...

01:41:24.813 --> 01:41:25.730
pushed me
all up in the tree...

01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:28.358
hand cuffs me
like this up here...

01:41:28.817 --> 01:41:30.235
and then he takes
my money, right?

01:41:30.694 --> 01:41:31.987
Took my money and
left me here like this...

01:41:32.445 --> 01:41:33.405
exposed to all the elements.

01:41:33.863 --> 01:41:35.365
Un-fucking-believable.

01:41:35.824 --> 01:41:37.283
Look at this fucking guy.

01:41:37.742 --> 01:41:39.703
Kids, you know,
if you out there...

01:41:40.161 --> 01:41:42.455
don't hate your firemen.

01:41:42.914 --> 01:41:44.165
Not all Fire Marshals like this.

01:41:44.624 --> 01:41:47.168
It's not like this,
so keep the love.

01:41:50.005 --> 01:41:52.173
Hard to believe.
You're watching "Top Story."

01:41:52.632 --> 01:41:54.175
How could you forget that
you hand cuffed a civilian...

01:41:54.634 --> 01:41:56.344
to a fucking tree
in Central Park...

01:41:56.803 --> 01:41:57.971
in the middle of the night?!
Tell me that!

01:41:58.430 --> 01:42:00.348
Look, all right,
I know I screwed up...

01:42:00.807 --> 01:42:02.350
but it's not like this guy
is some innocent civilian.

01:42:02.809 --> 01:42:04.728
He'll end your career
and probably mine!

01:42:05.186 --> 01:42:06.813
End my career?

01:42:07.272 --> 01:42:09.190
What am I talking about?
The press will be all over us!

01:42:09.649 --> 01:42:10.859
Get the fuck back to your desks!

01:42:11.318 --> 01:42:13.153
Come on, Chief.
Look at my file.

01:42:13.611 --> 01:42:15.530
I've never had a civilian
complaint against me before.

01:42:15.989 --> 01:42:18.408
-I crack big cases.
-Your record doesn't matter!

01:42:18.867 --> 01:42:19.784
It should mean something!

01:42:20.243 --> 01:42:21.536
That's past history!
Don't you get it?

01:42:21.995 --> 01:42:25.957
Look, I'm sorry.
It's unfortunate...

01:42:26.416 --> 01:42:28.335
that I have to make decisions
based on your press coverage...

01:42:28.793 --> 01:42:30.211
but that's what I gotta do.

01:42:30.670 --> 01:42:35.050
You're suspended, without pay,
pending a department trial.

01:42:35.508 --> 01:42:38.011
Not to mention
your criminal charges.

01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:39.971
That's not right.

01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:43.475
You better get yourself
a damn good lawyer.

01:43:24.683 --> 01:43:27.018
...over a million dollars
for the disputed video.

01:43:27.477 --> 01:43:31.147
In related news, Emil Slovak
is back in court tomorrow...

01:43:31.606 --> 01:43:32.524
where we're expected to learn...

01:43:32.983 --> 01:43:34.818
if he is competent
to stand trial.

01:43:35.276 --> 01:43:38.530
Meanwhile, the massive manhunt
continuesfor Oleg Razgul...

01:43:38.989 --> 01:43:40.490
the alleged mastermind
behind the murder...

01:43:40.949 --> 01:43:42.617
of New York City Detective
Eddie Flemming.

01:43:43.076 --> 01:43:45.870
"Action News" has learned that
Mr Slovakwon't have to worry...

01:43:46.329 --> 01:43:47.831
about how he is going
to pay for his defence.

01:43:48.289 --> 01:43:49.457
He has received movie offers...

01:43:49.916 --> 01:43:53.086
and has been in conversations
with numerous publishers...

01:43:53.545 --> 01:43:55.505
concerning the rights
to his story.

01:43:58.008 --> 01:43:59.384
Further developments
are expected today...

01:43:59.801 --> 01:44:01.594
in the bizarre Eddie Flemming
murder case.

01:44:02.053 --> 01:44:04.097
Judge Stanley Stern
will issue his ruling...

01:44:04.556 --> 01:44:07.475
on alleged killer
Emil Slovak's insanity plea.

01:44:07.934 --> 01:44:08.935
If the court rules
in his favour today...

01:44:09.394 --> 01:44:11.896
Mr Slovakwill be
transferred to the psych ward...

01:44:12.355 --> 01:44:13.773
at Rikers lsland
for further testing...

01:44:14.232 --> 01:44:15.483
before being remanded
to the custody...

01:44:15.942 --> 01:44:17.986
of a permanent institution
for the mentally ill.

01:44:18.445 --> 01:44:20.572
Slovak's attorney Bruce Cutler
has maintained...

01:44:21.031 --> 01:44:21.906
that an abusive childhood
is to blame...

01:44:22.365 --> 01:44:23.283
for the actions of his client.

01:44:23.742 --> 01:44:25.994
The Czech national
apparently has a history...

01:44:26.453 --> 01:44:27.287
of physical
and emotional trauma...

01:44:27.746 --> 01:44:30.373
heaped upon him
by an alcoholic father.

01:44:39.382 --> 01:44:41.301
What's ever left over, keep it.

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.178
Thanks, buddy.

01:45:00.779 --> 01:45:02.989
Keep the Statue of Liberty
in the background, all right?

01:45:03.448 --> 01:45:04.991
-How do I look?
-You look beautiful.

01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:07.535
Thanks. Fuck you. Roll.

01:45:07.994 --> 01:45:09.537
What are you looking at?

01:45:10.955 --> 01:45:12.207
Forget about him.
Let's go.

01:45:12.666 --> 01:45:14.334
All right. Just roll.

01:45:18.213 --> 01:45:19.381
All right. Let's go.

01:45:19.839 --> 01:45:21.967
Bruce Cutler,
do you have a statement for us?

01:45:22.425 --> 01:45:24.552
It's been a difficult
and long day for us.

01:45:25.011 --> 01:45:27.555
Emil has been found
incompetent to stand trial...

01:45:28.014 --> 01:45:30.767
and in times
of extreme stress...

01:45:31.226 --> 01:45:33.478
as a result of
his delusional thinking...

01:45:33.937 --> 01:45:36.898
he could not appreciate
the wrong fulness of his acts...

01:45:37.357 --> 01:45:40.026
and therefore he's not
liable for his acts.

01:45:40.485 --> 01:45:43.905
This is a victory
for the mentally ill...

01:45:44.364 --> 01:45:46.700
and before Emil
is taken on the boat...

01:45:47.158 --> 01:45:50.412
to the psychiatric ward
at Rikers lsland...

01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:52.706
it should be noted
that what he did...

01:45:53.164 --> 01:45:54.541
he was forced to do...

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.587
by Oleg Razgul, a dangerous
and demented individual...

01:46:00.046 --> 01:46:01.172
who is at liberty right now...

01:46:01.631 --> 01:46:04.467
in the streets of New York,
and both Emil and l...

01:46:04.926 --> 01:46:07.846
Iook forward to when
he is brought to justice.

01:46:09.389 --> 01:46:11.266
What the fuck are you
looking at,you piece of shit?

01:46:11.725 --> 01:46:12.851
Officers,you have to watch him.

01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:14.477
He's assaulted
my client in the past.

01:46:14.936 --> 01:46:16.563
That's it? This scumbag
kills Eddie Flemming...

01:46:17.022 --> 01:46:18.148
and now he gets to spend
the rest of his life...

01:46:18.606 --> 01:46:19.858
in some country club nuthouse?

01:46:20.317 --> 01:46:22.902
What about the victims and
the families and their rights?

01:46:23.361 --> 01:46:25.363
Marshal, I understand
you don't agree...

01:46:25.822 --> 01:46:28.575
but this is the system,
and this is the law.

01:46:30.243 --> 01:46:31.077
Let's go.

01:46:31.536 --> 01:46:33.621
I can kill you.
I'm insane.

01:46:35.206 --> 01:46:37.334
We need this area cleared.
Move back.

01:46:40.128 --> 01:46:41.171
...two-shot
of Cutler and Slovak.

01:46:41.630 --> 01:46:42.505
All right.

01:46:42.964 --> 01:46:44.215
Give me the boat
in the background.

01:46:44.674 --> 01:46:45.884
Do you really believe
that your client is insane?

01:46:46.343 --> 01:46:49.763
Emil knew exactly
what he was doing. Watch this.

01:46:50.221 --> 01:46:52.015
All right.

01:46:59.314 --> 01:47:00.190
Turn it off.

01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:02.567
This tape I kept for myself.

01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:07.947
In hospital
I say I'm not crazy...

01:47:08.406 --> 01:47:10.617
and because of your
double jeopardy law...

01:47:11.076 --> 01:47:13.411
we can't be tried for
the same crime twice.

01:47:13.870 --> 01:47:16.957
We come out
free, rich, and famous.

01:47:17.415 --> 01:47:20.085
Can we deal for this?

01:47:24.255 --> 01:47:25.924
It'sfree.

01:47:27.384 --> 01:47:28.927
What would you say
to evidence...

01:47:29.386 --> 01:47:31.012
that proves your client
is not insane?

01:47:31.471 --> 01:47:32.889
"Top Story" has
the truth right here...

01:47:33.348 --> 01:47:34.849
from Oleg Razgul himself.

01:47:35.308 --> 01:47:37.852
You knew what you were doing.

01:47:38.311 --> 01:47:39.813
It's all in here...in my movie.

01:47:40.271 --> 01:47:43.233
Officers, do your duty
and arrest this man!

01:47:43.692 --> 01:47:45.777
I'm not the killer.
I'm the director. Action!

01:47:53.159 --> 01:47:54.786
-Back off!
-Let her go!

01:47:55.245 --> 01:47:57.706
Everyone, back away from me!

01:47:58.164 --> 01:47:59.332
Hold your fire!
Do not fire your weapons!

01:47:59.791 --> 01:48:00.750
Stay back!

01:48:01.209 --> 01:48:02.085
Nobody's gonna fire.

01:48:02.544 --> 01:48:03.503
-Hold that line!
-Let her go!

01:48:03.962 --> 01:48:05.463
Tell him to put his gun down.

01:48:05.922 --> 01:48:08.258
-All right.
-Get that shotgun out of here!

01:48:08.717 --> 01:48:10.135
-Nobody's gonna fire.
-Stay back!

01:48:10.593 --> 01:48:12.679
Everybody, get back!
Do not fire, anyone!

01:48:13.138 --> 01:48:14.139
-Lower those weapons!
-Go tighter.

01:48:14.597 --> 01:48:15.640
Now! Lower!

01:48:16.099 --> 01:48:17.017
Tell him to put his gun down!

01:48:17.475 --> 01:48:18.852
-Put your weapon down!
-Let her go!

01:48:19.311 --> 01:48:20.520
If he doesn't lower his gun,
I'llfucking kill her!

01:48:20.979 --> 01:48:22.731
-Officer, lower that weapon!
-Loweryour gun!

01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:24.858
-Remember what he did to Eddie!
-Shut up!

01:48:25.317 --> 01:48:26.234
Do not fire that weapon!

01:48:26.693 --> 01:48:30.071
I'll surrender
if he lowers his gun.

01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:32.699
Don't you let this
piece of shit surrender!

01:48:33.158 --> 01:48:34.743
If you don't let me surrender,
I kill her now.

01:48:35.201 --> 01:48:36.870
-I don't care!
-I kill her now.

01:48:37.329 --> 01:48:38.288
Do not fire that weapon!

01:48:38.747 --> 01:48:40.206
-Shut up!
-Take that shot.

01:48:40.665 --> 01:48:42.334
God damn it!
You take that fucking shot!

01:48:42.792 --> 01:48:45.837
Officer, for the last time,
lower your weapon!

01:48:49.633 --> 01:48:51.885
Look, he's lowered the weapon.
Don't shoot her.

01:48:52.344 --> 01:48:53.511
You take that shot.

01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:57.766
He lowered his weapon.
You don't have to shoot her.

01:48:58.224 --> 01:48:59.726
He lowered the weapon,
all right?

01:49:17.452 --> 01:49:19.371
You're OK.
Don't look back.

01:49:19.829 --> 01:49:22.123
Don't look at him.

01:49:28.004 --> 01:49:31.341
Fuck! Did you get that?
Fuck!

01:49:36.554 --> 01:49:38.139
Let's get you out of here.

01:49:44.729 --> 01:49:46.106
Hey, boss.
He's still alive.

01:49:46.564 --> 01:49:47.816
Come on. Let's go.

01:50:31.234 --> 01:50:33.695
How was that?

01:50:34.779 --> 01:50:36.364
That was great.

01:50:57.427 --> 01:50:59.804
Thanks.

01:51:05.852 --> 01:51:07.270
I thought you might want that.

01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:15.945
Alan, here.
Take this camera.

01:51:17.864 --> 01:51:18.865
Marshal.

01:51:19.324 --> 01:51:21.368
Marshal,you feel up
to making a statement?

01:51:21.826 --> 01:51:22.619
All right. Forget it.
No statement.

01:51:23.078 --> 01:51:24.704
Cut the camera.
Listen, I can help you.

01:51:25.163 --> 01:51:26.414
Take a lessonfrom Eddie.

01:51:26.873 --> 01:51:28.166
The media can be
a powerful ally.

01:51:33.213 --> 01:51:36.383
Eddie was my friend.
I'd like to be yours, too.

01:51:59.197 --> 01:52:00.448
Good job.

01:52:49.289 --> 01:52:51.166
-You OK?
-I'm fine. Fuck him.

01:52:51.625 --> 01:52:54.377
Follow him walking away,
and then whip back to me.

01:53:04.554 --> 01:53:06.681
We've been talking with
Fire Marshal Jordan Warsaw.

01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:08.141
He's understandably
over whelmed...

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:10.018
with what's just
occurred here today--

01:53:10.477 --> 01:53:12.520
the tragic end
of two vicious psychopaths...

01:53:12.979 --> 01:53:14.189
who attempted to manipulate
the news media...

01:53:14.648 --> 01:53:16.274
for their own greed and egos.

01:53:16.733 --> 01:53:18.777
We at "Top Story"
will never allow ourselves...

01:53:19.235 --> 01:53:20.445
to be used in this way.

01:53:20.904 --> 01:53:23.990
Our goal is to bring you
the news in all its complexity.

01:53:24.449 --> 01:53:26.284
The truth was
the real hero here today...

01:53:26.743 --> 01:53:27.994
and we're proud
to have brought it to you...

01:53:28.453 --> 01:53:30.455
exclusively on "Top Story."

01:53:30.914 --> 01:53:33.792
This is Robert Hawkins.
Good night.
