Lisa: Sydney.
[laughs]

00:08.549 --> 00:10.617
Just one. I promise.

00:10.651 --> 00:12.785
Any more than that, and I won't
sit next to you at the bar.

00:12.820 --> 00:16.254
Sure you will, as long
as my card keeps the tab open.

00:16.657 --> 00:19.392
Go order me another Sazerac.
I'll be back in a second.

00:19.426 --> 00:21.961
Okay.

00:21.996 --> 00:23.963
[music continues]

00:23.998 --> 00:27.901
[door closes, music fades]

00:27.935 --> 00:29.569
Thank you.

00:29.603 --> 00:31.638
<i>It's a very bad habit.</i>

00:31.672 --> 00:34.607
Well, you're carrying around a lighter,
so I think ... [silenced gunshots]

00:48.489 --> 00:51.524
Then I realize my fly is open ...

00:51.559 --> 00:53.426
has been for the last 46 minutes.

00:53.494 --> 00:55.562
Now, there's only four minutes
left in the class.

00:55.596 --> 00:57.730
What do I do? Do I zip it up?
Do I leave it alone?

00:57.765 --> 00:59.032
I mean, I'm new.

00:59.066 --> 01:00.733
Is it better to be the guy who knew

01:00.801 --> 01:02.402
or the guy who had no idea?

01:02.469 --> 01:06.372
And all these thoughts are swirling
through my head, and I freeze.

01:06.407 --> 01:09.108
I jus... go completely silent ...

01:09.143 --> 01:12.979
Ticktock, ticktock ...
for four minutes until the bell rings.

01:13.047 --> 01:14.447
And ... and what?

01:14.515 --> 01:16.082
Did they all file out
with their eyes down,

01:16.116 --> 01:17.951
desperately avoiding
eye contact?

01:17.985 --> 01:20.587
A couple students didn't
look at me all semester.

01:20.621 --> 01:22.589
[both laugh]
Oh!

01:22.623 --> 01:24.490
Uh, I'm gonna go get us ...

01:24.525 --> 01:26.392
And, of course, I mean me ...
refills.

01:26.427 --> 01:27.393
Okay.

01:27.428 --> 01:29.495
[chuckles]

01:29.530 --> 01:30.730
He's great!

01:30.798 --> 01:32.565
- You think so?
- Yes!

01:32.633 --> 01:34.567
There's only one problem
with tonight.

01:34.635 --> 01:36.836
- What?
- You!

01:38.872 --> 01:41.874
He's awesome.
I'm awesome.

01:41.942 --> 01:43.876
You ... way too stiff.

01:43.944 --> 01:48.381
Maura, relax, okay?
The evening is going great.

01:48.415 --> 01:49.682
Oh, no, it isn't.

01:49.717 --> 01:51.684
Now I have all these water spots
on my blouse.

01:51.719 --> 01:53.519
Great ...
well, then, think about that

01:53.554 --> 01:55.488
instead of wondering whether
or not we're having a good time,

01:55.522 --> 01:57.690
because we're having a good time.

01:58.959 --> 02:01.127
Oh.
What happened?

02:01.161 --> 02:03.730
Oh, uh...
I have the dropss.

02:03.764 --> 02:07.333
- Do you want me to get you a towel?
- Oh, no. No. It's fine.

02:07.368 --> 02:10.336
But since we're telling
funny stories, I ...

02:10.371 --> 02:12.739
Really? You're gonna tell an
embarrassing story about yourself?

02:12.773 --> 02:16.042
- Okay, this ... this is a first.
- No.

02:16.110 --> 02:17.944
But remember the time
we went to the Adirondacks?

02:17.978 --> 02:19.812
<i>Don't you dare.</i>

02:19.847 --> 02:22.915
Jane and I had never tried it,
so we went camping.

02:22.950 --> 02:24.417
Uh-huh.

02:24.451 --> 02:26.786
[chuckles nervously]

02:26.820 --> 02:29.088
[chuckles] She really
doesn't like this story.

02:55.115 --> 02:56.649
<i>- Jane: No.
- What?!</i>

02:56.717 --> 02:58.618
Well, I answered "yes"
the first 17 times you asked.

02:58.652 --> 03:00.353
I'm thinking it's the wrong answer.

03:01.555 --> 03:03.956
Well, I'm just waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

03:04.024 --> 03:07.560
I'm the other shoe?
What do we got?

03:07.594 --> 03:09.796
Well, I didn't mean
you were a shoe.

03:09.863 --> 03:12.665
Sydney Allen,
out for a night with a friend.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.701
Came into the alley for a smoke.

03:14.735 --> 03:16.836
Two close-contact
gunshot wounds.

03:16.870 --> 03:18.104
Sexual assault, you think?

03:18.138 --> 03:21.774
Well, I can't be sure till I do
an exam, but clothing is intact.

03:21.809 --> 03:24.877
And there doesn't seem
to be any apparent signs

03:24.912 --> 03:28.047
- of her resisting an attack.
- Attempted robbery?

03:28.082 --> 03:30.383
Victim's purse was 30 feet away.
No cash in it.

03:30.417 --> 03:31.984
But could be
she wasn't carrying any.

03:32.019 --> 03:33.720
Okay, I'll check
with the patrols,

03:33.754 --> 03:35.655
see if there were any late-night
robberies in the vicinity.

03:36.857 --> 03:38.024
Well, she's married.

03:38.058 --> 03:42.995
Friend gave me his name.
Judson, C.E.O. of a tech start-up.

03:43.030 --> 03:45.865
I pulled his phone number
from the victim's phone.

03:45.899 --> 03:47.900
The dress doesn't exactly
scream "homemaker."

03:47.935 --> 03:50.002
- No.
- Did you check to see if he called

03:50.070 --> 03:51.537
- when she didn't come home?
- Yep.

03:51.572 --> 03:53.106
- Did he?
- Nope.

03:53.173 --> 03:54.540
Could mean nothing.

03:58.946 --> 04:01.481
[elevator bell dings]

04:01.515 --> 04:02.749
There were five 911 calls.

04:02.783 --> 04:04.550
One of them was a report of a gunshot.

04:04.585 --> 04:06.419
The others focus mainly on the victim.

04:06.453 --> 04:08.054
Nobody mentions a shooter.

04:08.088 --> 04:10.022
We followed up with four of the callers

04:10.057 --> 04:11.858
But didn't get any new information.

04:11.892 --> 04:14.560
- What about the fifth?
- Burner phone.

04:14.595 --> 04:17.029
We're tracking it,
but no luck so far.

04:17.064 --> 04:19.499
Yeah, we struck out on
the incident reports, as well.

04:19.533 --> 04:21.033
[cellphone buzzes]

04:22.603 --> 04:24.303
Interesting.

04:24.338 --> 04:26.823
I called the husband right
away, and when he didn't

04:26.824 --> 04:29.308
get back to me, I got a
warrant for his credit cards.

04:29.376 --> 04:31.766
Turns out he checked in to
the Merrimac hotel last night.

04:31.801 --> 04:34.480
- The one downtown?
- Yep.

04:34.515 --> 04:36.349
Well,
maybe this isn't a robbery.

04:36.383 --> 04:38.017
Maybe this is just divorce
the hard way

04:38.051 --> 04:41.320
and he checked in to the hotel
to give himself an alibi.

04:43.557 --> 04:47.360
The most interesting of the
textbooks is "police administration:

04:47.394 --> 04:49.529
Structures, processes,
and behaviors."

04:49.563 --> 04:51.731
720 pages of pure gold.

04:51.765 --> 04:54.801
- You had to memorize all that?
- No, but they reserve the right

04:54.835 --> 04:56.969
to put anything from the book
on the lieutenants exam.

04:57.004 --> 04:59.972
I mean, structures and
procedures, I get, but behaviors?

05:00.007 --> 05:02.708
I mean [scoffs] we're cops.
We're pains in the asses.

05:02.743 --> 05:04.911
You need 720 pages
to dissect that?

05:04.945 --> 05:06.913
You're gonna do fine
on the exam, by the way.

05:06.947 --> 05:08.614
Yeah, we'll see.

05:08.682 --> 05:10.817
Well, you're the best sergeant
detective in the building.

05:10.884 --> 05:12.385
They'd be idiots
not to promote you.

05:12.419 --> 05:15.721
If I don't study a little more,
they might be idiots if they do.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.404
[beep]

05:43.617 --> 05:46.819
Well, what's your textbook
have to say about that?

06:00.207 --> 06:01.974
[camera shutter clicks]

06:02.008 --> 06:05.478
Time of death was after
Sydney's, but not by much.

06:05.512 --> 06:06.412
What about the weapon?

06:06.413 --> 06:08.214
Can you determine if it was
the same for both murders?

06:08.248 --> 06:10.416
You know I can't answer
that question now, sergeant.

06:10.450 --> 06:12.885
We know,
but it never gets old asking.

06:12.919 --> 06:15.821
How about
the same-caliber bullet?

06:15.856 --> 06:19.562
Well, I'll take a leap into the
void and say that this bullet

06:19.563 --> 06:23.028
is the same caliber as the one
I removed from Sydney Allen.

06:23.063 --> 06:25.331
Let's assume that both victims
were killed by the same person.

06:25.365 --> 06:29.034
- I'm not willing to assume that.
- Okay.

06:29.069 --> 06:31.103
Let's say that Korsak and I
are willing to assume

06:31.171 --> 06:33.239
that both victims were killed
by the same person.

06:33.273 --> 06:35.207
That narrows
our list of suspects down

06:35.242 --> 06:37.810
to people
that needed them both dead.

06:37.844 --> 06:39.945
Interesting that the wife
was killed first.

06:39.980 --> 06:42.181
Could be that the murderer knew
Judson was here

06:42.215 --> 06:43.482
and wasn't going anywhere.

06:43.517 --> 06:46.428
Maybe. Frankie's getting
the security videotape.

06:46.463 --> 06:48.237
Maybe we'll get a look at him.

06:53.526 --> 06:55.194
Excuse me.

06:55.228 --> 06:57.863
Which one of you got the call
about Judson Allen?

06:57.898 --> 07:01.934
- That'd be me.
- Hi. You're new.

07:01.968 --> 07:06.505
- Frank... ie Rizzoli.
- I'm Nin... a Holiday.

07:06.540 --> 07:08.307
[chuckles] You temping?

07:08.341 --> 07:09.909
No. This is
my new assignment.

07:09.943 --> 07:11.243
You gonna need some time
to settle in?

07:11.278 --> 07:12.745
Nope.

07:12.779 --> 07:14.246
Allen co-founded a company
called Inverta.

07:14.314 --> 07:17.132
There's no public information,
but I found a thread in

07:17.133 --> 07:19.747
a Venture Capital blog
about a Boston-based biogen

07:19.748 --> 07:22.054
company getting a new
eight-figure investment.

07:22.088 --> 07:24.223
Turns out the V.C. mentioned
flew into Boston yesterday

07:24.257 --> 07:25.891
and checked in to the Merrimac hotel.

07:25.926 --> 07:28.060
So, Judson Allen's about to hit
the mother lode.

07:28.094 --> 07:30.496
- Looks like it.
- You're not from Boston, are you?

07:30.564 --> 07:32.264
No ... Chicago.

07:32.299 --> 07:35.201
- Cubs or White Sox?
- Cubs.

07:35.235 --> 07:37.870
No self-respecting White Sox fan
would move to Boston.

07:37.904 --> 07:40.873
Hey, uh,
thanks for finding us a motive.

07:40.907 --> 07:44.109
Also, I got the hotel videotape.
[mouse clicks]

07:44.144 --> 07:45.878
This is the only person

07:45.946 --> 07:47.513
who exits the elevator
during your time frame.

07:47.581 --> 07:49.081
He doesn't want to be seen,
does he?

07:49.115 --> 07:52.751
No, but...
I pulled his reflection from the glass

07:52.786 --> 07:55.154
- on the picture frame on the wall.
- Nice.

07:55.188 --> 07:58.390
Welcome to beantown, Nina Holiday.

08:02.862 --> 08:05.297
Ballistics confirm
that Sydney and her husband

08:05.332 --> 08:07.233
were killed by the same gun.

08:07.300 --> 08:11.070
And these striations indicate
that a silencer was used.

08:11.104 --> 08:14.139
- Professional hit.
- That's not what I'm saying.

08:14.174 --> 08:16.141
Sorry. I'm not putting that
in your mouth.

08:16.176 --> 08:18.877
I'm saying it 'cause I get
to say whatever the hell I want.

08:18.912 --> 08:21.247
Nobody asks me for scientific
evidence to support it.

08:21.281 --> 08:22.461
Well, lucky you.

08:22.504 --> 08:24.984
Oh, you wouldn't do it even if
the commonwealth said you could.

08:25.051 --> 08:28.053
- No, probably not.
- The real question is,

08:28.088 --> 08:30.756
why did someone hire a hit man
to kill them?

08:32.058 --> 08:34.025
Oh.
 I'm not expecting you to answer.

08:34.059 --> 08:36.227
I'm just thinking out loud.
Thanks, doc.

08:39.566 --> 08:42.400
- Looks like a professional hit.
- Really?

08:42.434 --> 08:44.135
Yeah, same gun, silencer,

08:44.169 --> 08:47.172
and it takes a lot of confidence
to kill somebody through a peephole.

08:47.207 --> 08:50.142
Well, our guy is coming
into a lot of money.

08:50.176 --> 08:52.144
Maybe we start at the
company he founded.

08:52.178 --> 08:53.412
This is yours.

08:53.446 --> 08:55.047
- Oh, what is it?
- Toffee.

08:55.949 --> 08:58.050
I made that up. It's wrapped.
I don't know what it is.

08:58.118 --> 09:00.386
You would.

09:00.420 --> 09:02.755
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

09:02.789 --> 09:05.724
Grover Verben, the Dodgers' lefty lion.

09:05.759 --> 09:08.227
- This is awesome!
- Who gave it to you?

09:08.261 --> 09:09.762
Maura's new boyfriend.

09:09.829 --> 09:12.231
Must be quite a guy. Bet
that's an expensive gift.

09:12.265 --> 09:14.867
- You think he's trying to buy influence?
- Is it gonna work?

09:14.934 --> 09:17.069
No. But, still, a cool gift.

09:17.137 --> 09:18.971
Detective Korsak?
 Mr. Harper's here.

09:19.005 --> 09:20.472
I'll be right there.

09:20.507 --> 09:23.409
- Wow.
- And this is why

09:23.443 --> 09:26.145
there are no Vince
Korsak-signed baseballs.

09:26.179 --> 09:28.380
That and my .128
lifetime batting average.

09:28.415 --> 09:30.983
- Really?
- You don't want to know.

09:31.051 --> 09:32.184
Really?

09:32.218 --> 09:35.120
I can't believe it. I just...

09:35.155 --> 09:37.990
I can't believe they're dead.

09:38.024 --> 09:40.993
Wish we'd signed the financing
papers at the V.C.'s yesterday.

09:41.027 --> 09:43.896
That's a pretty callous
response, Mr. Harper.

09:43.930 --> 09:46.649
No.
I-I just mean that it would

09:46.650 --> 09:50.135
give our employees a chance to find
new jobs while they have a paycheck.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.970
The company's gonna have to shut down?

09:52.005 --> 09:53.872
We've got money in the bank
to carry us a week or two,

09:53.907 --> 09:56.342
but... Judson was the
genius behind Inverta.

09:56.376 --> 09:58.911
Without him, I won't be
able to fund a garage sale.

09:58.945 --> 10:01.113
So, who benefits if Judson's dead?

10:01.181 --> 10:04.216
Is there some other company
that has a competing technology?

10:04.250 --> 10:09.288
- The murders weren't random?
- We don't think so.

10:09.322 --> 10:11.857
I can't think of anybody
who'd want to kill them.

10:13.093 --> 10:14.560
[chuckles]

10:14.594 --> 10:16.228
Why is that funny, Mr. Harper?

10:16.262 --> 10:18.564
Well, I can't think of anybody
who'd want to kill Judson,

10:18.598 --> 10:22.101
but... if Sydney were the only
one dead, it'd be easy to think

10:22.135 --> 10:25.037
- that Judson was the one that killed her.
- Excuse me?

10:25.071 --> 10:28.240
He hated her.
Judson grew up

10:28.274 --> 10:30.175
in a terrible neighborhood
outside Philadelphia,

10:30.243 --> 10:31.977
scraped his way into
an Ivy League school.

10:32.011 --> 10:34.913
He founded his first
company before he graduated.

10:34.948 --> 10:39.251
When he met Sydney, he was
impressed by her sophistication.

10:39.285 --> 10:42.421
- So what took the bloom off the rose?
- When Inverta took off,

10:42.455 --> 10:44.356
it became clear she
was just a gold digger.

10:44.391 --> 10:46.225
She'd found the
shiniest fish in the pond

10:46.259 --> 10:49.194
- and attached herself to it.
- So Judson wanted a divorce.

10:49.262 --> 10:50.863
He just didn't want to
give her half his money.

10:50.930 --> 10:53.232
Something like that.

10:55.167 --> 10:58.837
- You called?
- Hey, Janie. You met Nina?

10:58.872 --> 11:02.307
- No. Hi. Jane Rizzoli.
- Rizzoli? Like...

11:02.342 --> 11:05.277
Yep. I'm the reason the
department has a nepotism policy.

11:05.345 --> 11:06.525
No, you're the reason the department

11:06.526 --> 11:08.514
- got rid of vending machines.
- Nice.

11:08.548 --> 11:11.417
- What do you got?
- A couple things.

11:11.451 --> 11:13.732
First, we found three
$10,000 withdrawals from

11:13.733 --> 11:16.255
Judson Allen's personal
account made three weeks ago.

11:16.322 --> 11:18.090
Huh.

11:18.158 --> 11:20.058
I thought the hit man killed
Judson over a payment dispute.

11:20.093 --> 11:22.161
But if he paid him in advance,
it doesn't make any sense.

11:22.195 --> 11:23.362
Mm-hmm.

11:23.396 --> 11:26.432
- You said "a couple things"?
- We ordered the 911 calls

11:26.466 --> 11:28.333
in case there was anything
that wasn't in the transcripts.

11:28.401 --> 11:32.271
On the face of it, nothing. But...
Go ahead. Play it.

11:32.305 --> 11:34.106
Nina pulled down the
level in the voices.

11:34.140 --> 11:37.276
<i>Woman: A woman just got
shot behind the Beacon club.</i>

11:37.343 --> 11:39.211
That's from the first call
... from the burner phone.

11:39.245 --> 11:41.914
This is the second call.

11:41.948 --> 11:43.449
<i>[indistinct conversations] Lisa: Send
an ambulance! My friend's been shot!</i>

11:43.483 --> 11:46.351
Now, in the first call, you
can't hear any background noises,

11:46.386 --> 11:48.020
but in the second call, you
can hear sounds from the club.

11:48.054 --> 11:50.031
Which means that the person who made the

11:50.032 --> 11:52.157
call from the burner
phone was in the alley

11:52.192 --> 11:53.525
before someone came out
and discovered the body.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.527
- A witness.
- Yeah.

11:55.562 --> 11:57.996
So, Judson hires a hit
man to kill his wife.

11:58.031 --> 12:00.265
The two of them aren't
gonna rat on each other.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.868
But once there's a witness
who can identify the hit man,

12:02.936 --> 12:05.370
Judson becomes a liability.
That's why Judson's dead.

12:05.405 --> 12:08.903
The killer is covering his tracks.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.410
If the girl in that
call isn't dead already,

12:11.444 --> 12:14.884
she will be if we don't get
to her before the hit man does.

12:14.981 --> 12:17.349
[both sigh]

12:26.665 --> 12:30.435
- Purse was over here?
- Yeah, about 30 feet from the victim.

12:30.469 --> 12:33.304
[sighs] Well, maybe he dropped it
when he realized there was a witness.

12:33.339 --> 12:34.839
He had a gun. If she'd been
close, he'd have shot her.

12:36.508 --> 12:40.845
Right. So, if she ran out of the alley,
she just would have kept running.

12:40.879 --> 12:43.181
We would have seen her
on the street cameras.

12:43.215 --> 12:45.950
So... she never left the alley.

13:32.898 --> 13:37.168
- Clear.
- Clear.

13:41.206 --> 13:42.607
[holsters gun]

13:42.641 --> 13:44.509
Korsak, look at this.

13:47.946 --> 13:50.181
This stuff isn't dusty.

14:01.327 --> 14:06.197
- It's homework.
- From a high school.

14:06.231 --> 14:08.333
We're looking for a kid.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.468
Well, what the hell
is she doing down here?

14:16.375 --> 14:18.142
Techs finished in the basement.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.278
They didn't find any other
bullets or any traces of blood,

14:20.312 --> 14:22.146
so, hopefully, our witness survived.

14:22.181 --> 14:23.915
Could be she got herself locked
in the basement long enough

14:23.949 --> 14:25.450
she was able to get away from him.

14:25.517 --> 14:26.818
We're checking to see if
any cameras picked her up

14:26.852 --> 14:29.420
on the other side of the building.
Nothing so far.

14:29.455 --> 14:31.406
- What about an I.D.?
- Nina: Not yet.

14:31.523 --> 14:33.858
The textbook is used throughout
the Boston public school system.

14:33.926 --> 14:35.493
The good news is, only three schools

14:35.527 --> 14:36.728
are offering the class
for the summer session.

14:36.762 --> 14:38.629
And we have calls in to all of them.

14:38.697 --> 14:40.636
And I've got a bot searching
FBI wiretaps looking for

14:40.637 --> 14:42.467
the names of local guys
who might have done the hit.

14:42.534 --> 14:43.701
It's a long shot, but...

14:43.736 --> 14:47.104
Well, I don't know what "a bot" is,
but I appreciate the effort.

14:48.774 --> 14:50.608
What do you think of her?

14:50.642 --> 14:51.743
- Who? Nina?
- Yeah.

14:51.777 --> 14:53.878
She seems all right ... helpful.

14:53.912 --> 14:56.314
Least likely to leave cheeto
crumbs on the keyboard.

14:56.348 --> 14:58.783
- Why?
- She's our new homicide hire.

14:58.817 --> 15:00.318
- What?
- Yeah.

15:00.352 --> 15:01.919
I got wind of a chicago P.D. uniform

15:01.954 --> 15:03.654
that was transferring in the department.

15:03.722 --> 15:06.391
- So, why isn't she on the streets?
- She wanted to make a change.

15:06.425 --> 15:08.326
Didn't think it'd be
received well back home.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.861
There's got to be more to it than that.

15:09.895 --> 15:12.363
Probably, but what I cared about ...

15:12.398 --> 15:15.666
she has a perfect service record,
a clean psych eval,

15:15.701 --> 15:18.403
and B.P.D. bought my argument
that for now, we'd be better off

15:18.437 --> 15:21.205
with a dedicated bric homicide analyst
than another detective.

15:21.273 --> 15:24.598
- What about Frankie?
- Same job. He just got a new employee.

15:25.210 --> 15:28.346
You did this so it'd be
easy on me, didn't you?

15:29.581 --> 15:32.717
I did it because it's the
best thing for the unit.

15:44.663 --> 15:46.531
Grover Verben.

15:46.565 --> 15:48.599
That kid's parents
didn't do him any favors.

15:48.634 --> 15:50.935
Ma, that's not the point.
It's a fantastic gift.

15:50.969 --> 15:54.405
Amazing.
Why'd you spill all over it?

15:54.440 --> 15:55.840
I didn't!

15:55.874 --> 15:59.911
It hit the coffee cup, and that spilled,
and then it rolled into ...

15:59.945 --> 16:01.913
- So it's the ball's fault?
- Please?

16:01.947 --> 16:04.348
Please, can you get it out? Please?

16:04.416 --> 16:05.583
[sighs]

16:05.617 --> 16:09.654
- It won't be easy.
- But you can do it. You can.

16:09.721 --> 16:12.657
Remember when I spilled motor
oil on my communion dress?

16:12.691 --> 16:15.460
I mean, when you were finished
with it, it looked like new.

16:15.494 --> 16:19.664
All right, give me some time
and, uh, I'll work my magic.

16:19.698 --> 16:23.234
Thank you, because I checked online,
and a replacement is 500 bucks.

16:23.268 --> 16:25.670
[scoffs] I'm sure it is.

16:25.704 --> 16:29.707
Look ... a little white
vinegar gently rubbed around it.

16:29.741 --> 16:31.542
I'll make it look like new.

16:31.577 --> 16:33.311
<i>But worse comes to worst,</i>

16:33.345 --> 16:35.613
<i>you tell Maura that
y-you had an accident.</i>

16:35.681 --> 16:37.682
As a last resort. Come on.

16:37.716 --> 16:39.550
Her new boyfriend gives
me a fantastic gift,

16:39.585 --> 16:41.152
I don't want to tell her I ruined it.

16:41.186 --> 16:43.888
All right. 
Stop worrying. I'll fix it.

16:43.922 --> 16:45.623
You can do it, Ma. Thank you.

16:45.657 --> 16:48.159
Thank you so much. Thank you.
You can do it.

16:48.193 --> 16:49.694
Thank you, Ma!

16:52.965 --> 16:54.565
Who's that?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.934
Nina's bot found five guys
who could have done the hit.

16:56.969 --> 16:59.381
Of those, one's dead, two
are in jail, leaving these

16:59.382 --> 17:01.839
two handsome fellows as our
most likely local suspects.

17:01.874 --> 17:03.341
Judson's business partner said

17:03.375 --> 17:05.142
he was from the rough
side of Philadelphia.

17:05.176 --> 17:07.111
We should check to see if he
contacted anyone back home.

17:07.145 --> 17:08.445
Girl named Tasha Williams

17:08.480 --> 17:10.248
takes that physics class
at Monroe High School.

17:10.281 --> 17:11.682
She didn't show up to class today.

17:11.717 --> 17:13.451
No one called to say she'd be absent.

17:13.519 --> 17:15.520
Can you get us directions
to the high school?

17:15.554 --> 17:16.854
I'll send them to you in the car.

17:16.888 --> 17:19.757
[cellphone buzzes]

17:19.790 --> 17:23.127
- What is it?
- It's directions.

17:24.563 --> 17:26.731
Nina will send them to you while
you're standing right there.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.302
[chuckles]

17:37.743 --> 17:39.343
Hi.

17:39.378 --> 17:41.712
What are you doing home
in the middle of the day?

17:41.747 --> 17:45.249
Oh, I was working on a file
in the bathtub last night,

17:45.317 --> 17:47.251
and I forgot to bring
it back to the office.

17:47.319 --> 17:51.422
- Is that relaxing?
- Well, a bath releases stress responses,

17:51.456 --> 17:53.224
which is good for my hippocampus.

17:53.258 --> 17:54.825
That helps memory and learning,

17:54.860 --> 17:57.461
which helps me arrive at
new solutions to problems.

17:57.496 --> 17:59.430
And since not being
able to figure things out

17:59.464 --> 18:02.600
sparks a negative response
from my sympathetic nervous system,

18:02.634 --> 18:06.737
- the bath works on all fronts.
- Oh...

18:06.772 --> 18:10.775
I like a bath, too.
I catch up on my People magazines.

18:13.278 --> 18:15.880
- Where did that come from?
- What?

18:15.914 --> 18:17.515
Oh.

18:17.549 --> 18:21.686
Uh, that's my, uh, Blober
Beiber, uh, n-nurr ball.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.187
Grover Verben.

18:23.221 --> 18:25.389
It was Jack's, and he gave it to Jane.

18:25.424 --> 18:27.792
Yes. That was so nice of him.

18:27.826 --> 18:31.596
What a lovely gift.
It's a family heirloom.

18:31.630 --> 18:33.130
Yeah, but what is it doing here?

18:33.198 --> 18:35.433
- Enh!
- Angela?

18:35.467 --> 18:37.868
Maura?
Let it go.

18:37.903 --> 18:39.637
[grunts] Stop!

18:39.671 --> 18:42.540
Stop it! Stop it!

18:42.574 --> 18:46.110
[clears throat]

18:46.178 --> 18:48.579
"Grover Ver"?

18:48.614 --> 18:50.381
The "ben" is silent.

18:50.415 --> 18:53.618
The "ben" is not silent.
 It's missing.

18:53.685 --> 18:56.385
- What happened to it?
- I don't know.

18:56.420 --> 19:00.057
Maybe he got tired
signing all those autographs.

19:00.826 --> 19:03.127
All right, Jane spilled coffee on it,

19:03.195 --> 19:08.065
- and she asked me to get the stain out.
- Well, you did.

19:08.133 --> 19:10.368
[laughing] It's just too bad
the stain was on the signature.

19:10.402 --> 19:14.705
I know. I made it worse.
Jane brought it to me

19:14.740 --> 19:18.175
because she thinks I'm some kind
of whiz with the stain removal.

19:18.210 --> 19:19.677
Yeah, she did say once

19:19.711 --> 19:21.679
that you got motor oil
out of her communion dress.

19:21.713 --> 19:24.515
[chuckling] Yeah. Kind of.
I-I bought her a new one.

19:24.583 --> 19:28.219
- So you kind of didn't.
- It's mom logic.

19:28.253 --> 19:31.622
[chuckles] Don't worry.
It's not a big deal.

19:31.690 --> 19:33.624
Yeah, it will be to
Jane when she finds out.

19:33.659 --> 19:36.160
She doesn't want to
hurt Jack's feelings.

19:36.194 --> 19:38.362
She doesn't? That's sweet.

19:38.397 --> 19:43.467
- No, and I think it's totally neurotic.
- It's sweet.

19:43.502 --> 19:46.537
So it doesn't matter that
I erased half his name?

19:46.571 --> 19:49.240
It'll matter to Jane.

19:50.274 --> 19:52.710
I hate baseball.

19:56.448 --> 19:58.282
Tasha is a wonderful young woman.

19:58.316 --> 20:01.385
It's remarkable how well she does
here, given her circumstances.

20:01.420 --> 20:04.655
- Which are what?
- I'm almost certain she's homeless.

20:04.690 --> 20:08.559
- Almost certain?
- She's guarded about anything personal.

20:08.627 --> 20:11.429
Clean but often wears the same
outfit one day to the next,

20:11.463 --> 20:14.398
and there's no phone number on file.
Those are giveaways.

20:14.466 --> 20:16.400
Any idea where we might find her?

20:16.435 --> 20:19.270
We have an address on file.

20:19.304 --> 20:20.371
[computer beeps]

20:20.405 --> 20:24.175
But I don't think she's there.
Even her family is looking for her.

20:24.209 --> 20:27.278
- Her family?
- An uncle was in this morning.

20:27.312 --> 20:29.714
He said they hadn't seen
her in a couple of days.

20:29.748 --> 20:32.450
He came to school to
make sure she was okay.

20:32.484 --> 20:34.285
Is this him?

20:34.319 --> 20:37.822
He didn't have a beard,
the hair was lighter,

20:37.889 --> 20:39.423
but there's definitely a similarity.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.726
He's shaved his beard.
I'll update our BOLO.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.594
Can you tell me about the uncle?

20:43.628 --> 20:45.229
He said the family was worried

20:45.263 --> 20:47.498
and wanted to know if
Tasha had come to school.

20:47.532 --> 20:50.574
I asked his name
to check if he was one of

20:50.575 --> 20:53.237
her responsible parties.
He wasn't, so I told him

20:53.271 --> 20:55.272
I couldn't give him any information.

20:55.307 --> 20:57.341
- And then he left?
- Not right away.

20:57.375 --> 21:02.454
The phone rang, and there was
nobody there when I picked it up.

21:04.583 --> 21:09.317
Okay. Um, can you call
us if he comes back?

21:09.421 --> 21:10.955
Thank you very much.

21:12.724 --> 21:15.092
He got a look at her records.
He's got all her information ...

21:15.126 --> 21:17.928
- an address, social security number.
- How did he get here?

21:17.962 --> 21:19.596
She was doing homework in the basement.

21:19.631 --> 21:21.865
Maybe he saw a backpack, a textbook.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.967
Until we catch this guy,
everything's by the book.

21:24.002 --> 21:25.602
I want you to promise me

21:25.637 --> 21:26.970
you'll follow B.P.D.
protocols no matter what.

21:27.005 --> 21:30.174
- Yeah, fine, fine.
- Maybe I'll make lieutenant

21:30.208 --> 21:32.075
and you'll get to work
with someone new ...

21:32.110 --> 21:33.644
[school bell rings] who doesn't
know you as well as I do.

21:33.678 --> 21:35.012
I hope you do make lieutenant.

21:35.046 --> 21:36.813
I'm gonna put superglue
on your big, fancy chair.

21:36.848 --> 21:39.216
I wouldn't expect anything less.

21:46.211 --> 21:47.912
<i>Frankie: Uniforms went to
the address Tasha had on </i>

21:47.913 --> 21:49.713
file with the school. 
It was an abandoned building.

21:49.747 --> 21:52.716
- Any evidence she was there?
- Looks like maybe not for a while.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.084
But the big news is this.

21:54.118 --> 21:57.187
We tracked down her parents.
They're both dead.

21:57.222 --> 21:58.689
Dad ... five years ago of an aneurysm.

21:58.756 --> 22:00.691
Mom ... 18 months ago, cancer.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.143
All right. Well, then, why
isn't she in foster care?

22:03.177 --> 22:05.946
Social services think she's in
the custody of her grandmother.

22:05.980 --> 22:07.981
And I'm sure all the information
on her grandmother is bogus.

22:08.049 --> 22:10.317
- 100,000 %.
- Extreme bogosity.

22:10.351 --> 22:12.252
Korsak: But let me get this straight.

22:12.286 --> 22:14.855
Teenager scams social services,
and she's living on the street,

22:14.889 --> 22:17.924
taking care of herself for at least
18 months while going to school?

22:17.959 --> 22:21.228
And maintaining a B-plus average.
How does she survive?

22:21.262 --> 22:23.029
Well, if her parents are dead,

22:23.064 --> 22:25.532
she's entitled to survivor
benefits from social security.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.701
Give her enough money to live
on ... at least the basics.

22:27.735 --> 22:30.146
Any chance the S.S.A. will give us
the address they've been

22:30.147 --> 22:32.572
- mailing the checks to?
- It'll take time.

22:32.607 --> 22:34.241
Well, she's got to cash them somewhere.

22:34.275 --> 22:36.309
Can you look up those
check-cashing places?

22:36.377 --> 22:38.311
Look for one around the
crime scene, her school,

22:38.346 --> 22:40.680
and that abandoned
building she lived in.

22:40.715 --> 22:42.649
[computer beeps]

22:42.683 --> 22:44.117
We'll have to split up.

22:44.152 --> 22:45.619
I don't like it ... not
with a hit man out there.

22:45.653 --> 22:47.087
Yeah, but what other choice do we have?

22:47.121 --> 22:48.688
Hold on ... this guy killed a woman,

22:48.723 --> 22:50.514
then he killed the guy that
hired him to do it, and now he's

22:50.515 --> 22:52.159
trying to kill this girl that
witnessed the first murder.

22:52.193 --> 22:54.161
- Vests ... everybody.
- Okay.

22:54.195 --> 22:58.249
- Jane?
- It's in the car.

23:00.768 --> 23:03.170
<i>Yeah, I recognize her. She
hasn't been in this month.</i>

23:03.204 --> 23:05.939
<i>But checks come in Tuesday,
so she'll probably be in Wednesday.</i>

23:06.007 --> 23:08.608
Any chance you could pull security video
from the last month?

23:08.643 --> 23:09.943
Maybe she came in with somebody.

23:10.011 --> 23:11.178
I can't even go in the
room with the recorder.

23:11.212 --> 23:15.916
The manager yells at me.
I tend to spill.

23:15.950 --> 23:19.986
I find it hard to believe that
a man like you could be bullied.

23:20.021 --> 23:21.955
Well, I wouldn't say "bullying," really.

23:21.989 --> 23:24.958
- That's kind of a strong ...
- You know what I think?

23:25.026 --> 23:27.761
I think he's using his
aggression to cover his fear.

23:27.795 --> 23:30.797
- He's the manager.
- He feels threatened.

23:30.865 --> 23:34.201
- By...?
- Exactly.

23:34.235 --> 23:37.838
He sees what I see ... a man
that challenges authority.

23:37.872 --> 23:42.242
Sometimes I'm late,
and I don't even call.

23:42.276 --> 23:45.145
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

23:45.179 --> 23:47.214
I think you're gonna have
a chain of these places

23:47.248 --> 23:52.185
and that manager's gonna
work for you. Unless...

23:55.723 --> 23:57.090
Forget it.

23:57.124 --> 24:00.760
Um... thank you very much for your time.

24:00.828 --> 24:02.162
No! Wait!

24:04.799 --> 24:06.533
Unless what?

24:08.636 --> 24:11.905
Unless you decide what's
right and what's wrong.

24:11.973 --> 24:15.842
A girl's life is at stake
here, and you can help her.

24:20.681 --> 24:23.583
[static] We've got a terrible
connection. Where are you?

24:23.618 --> 24:26.720
<i>Grand Street. 
I got a lead on Tasha.</i>

24:26.787 --> 24:31.258
It's a partial address from
her social security check.

24:31.292 --> 24:34.194
Well, that's a start.

24:34.228 --> 24:37.063
- Let's meet at B.P.D. and ...
- Listen, I'm gonna ...

24:37.098 --> 24:38.331
[static continues] I'm
gonna look around... Okay?

24:38.366 --> 24:41.701
I can't hear you, Jane.
Hello?

24:41.769 --> 24:43.169
Korsak, I can't hear you, all right?

24:43.237 --> 24:45.105
So I'll call you if I
find something definitive.

26:00.648 --> 26:02.282
Tasha?

26:06.887 --> 26:09.022
Tasha, my name is
Detective Jane Rizzoli.

26:09.056 --> 26:13.059
I'm just here to help.
Tasha, you here?

26:16.931 --> 26:18.698
[sighs]

26:27.608 --> 26:29.109
[lock clicks]

26:29.143 --> 26:30.810
<i>Wait! No!</i>

26:30.845 --> 26:31.845
<i>Tasha, wait a minute. Wait
a minute. Wait a minute.</i>

26:31.879 --> 26:33.913
Open the door.

26:33.948 --> 26:35.749
<i>Please.</i>

26:36.984 --> 26:38.251
<i>You're in danger!</i>

26:44.058 --> 26:46.660
<i>He's looking for you.</i>

26:49.964 --> 26:53.133
<i>Please. Wait, no. 
I know what you saw!</i>

26:55.836 --> 26:57.971
<i>Please, honey!</i>

26:58.005 --> 27:00.940
<i>I know what you saw.
I know you're scared.</i>

27:03.911 --> 27:05.244
<i>Please.</i>

27:06.547 --> 27:07.914
<i>Come on.</i>

27:12.219 --> 27:17.924
<i>If I can find you,
he can find you. Okay?</i>

27:19.727 --> 27:21.161
<i>Please open the door.</i>

27:23.664 --> 27:25.632
Show me your badge.

27:32.707 --> 27:35.656
I just want to protect you.
That's all.

27:45.419 --> 27:47.656
You all right?

27:48.522 --> 27:50.056
Okay.

27:50.090 --> 27:52.825
That's ... that's my
car right there. Okay?

27:52.860 --> 27:55.261
I just want to take you
to B.P.D. headquarters,

27:55.296 --> 27:58.364
and ... and we'll get you
someplace safe. All right?

27:58.399 --> 28:00.333
<i>Okay?</i>

28:01.268 --> 28:02.802
Come on.

28:07.908 --> 28:09.542
[gunshot]

28:09.576 --> 28:10.877

28:10.944 --> 28:13.012
[grunts]

28:13.046 --> 28:14.614
[gunshot]

28:20.154 --> 28:22.921
Okay.
Get up, baby.

28:23.090 --> 28:24.490

28:47.054 --> 28:48.387
<i>Okay.</i>

28:54.929 --> 28:56.029
[panting]

28:56.064 --> 28:59.166
Just hang on. [whimpers]
It's okay.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.902
Just hang on.
Okay.

29:01.936 --> 29:02.903
[groans]

29:02.970 --> 29:05.272
[alarm rings]

29:05.339 --> 29:07.574
It's all right.

29:07.608 --> 29:09.242
It's all right. It's
all right. We're safe.

29:09.277 --> 29:12.212
- We're between floors, okay?
- Okay.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.480
[panting]

29:13.548 --> 29:15.382
I'm gonna sleep now.

29:15.416 --> 29:16.850
No, no, no. Tasha.
 No, no, no, no.

29:16.885 --> 29:19.519
No. Hey! Hey. 
You stay with me, okay?

29:19.587 --> 29:22.389
- You stay awake. Okay?
- Okay.

29:22.423 --> 29:23.657
Um... here.

29:23.691 --> 29:24.925
[groans]

29:24.959 --> 29:26.026
Listen to me, okay?
 Listen to me.

29:26.060 --> 29:27.494
[whimpers] 
Listen to me.

29:27.528 --> 29:30.931
All right? 
This is real important, okay?

29:30.965 --> 29:35.535
There, uh... [grunts]
There are three criminals, okay?

29:35.570 --> 29:37.938
And they were sentenced
to exile in the desert.

29:37.972 --> 29:40.040
- Okay? [groans]
- What are you ... what?

29:40.074 --> 29:42.476
Shh.
It's a joke. It's a joke.

29:42.510 --> 29:43.543
Don't talk. 
You'll mess up my rhythm.

29:43.578 --> 29:45.779
All right.
The first criminal says...

29:45.813 --> 29:47.547
All right.

29:47.582 --> 29:49.850
"I brought a loaf of
bread, so if I get hungry,

29:49.918 --> 29:52.152
I have something to eat."

29:52.186 --> 29:56.690
And the second criminal says, "oh, yeah?
Well, I brought a canteen.

29:56.724 --> 29:58.926
If I get thirsty, I
got something to drink."

29:58.960 --> 30:01.729
Huh?
And the third criminal,

30:01.796 --> 30:03.230
he looks at these guys like
they're idiots, you know?

30:03.264 --> 30:05.866
'Cause he's a lot smarter than they are.
He's real proud of himself, right?

30:05.900 --> 30:08.902
And he says, "oh, yeah?
"Well, I brought a car door,

30:08.937 --> 30:11.872
so if I get hot, I can
roll down a window."

30:11.906 --> 30:13.707
[both laugh]

30:13.742 --> 30:15.476
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

30:15.510 --> 30:16.643
[laughs] Oh!

30:16.678 --> 30:18.645
Aah! 
[groaning]

30:18.680 --> 30:20.447
[crying]

30:20.482 --> 30:23.817
[panting]

30:23.885 --> 30:26.687
- You're sneaky.
- Yeah.

30:26.721 --> 30:28.689
I'm sorry, baby. I knew
that was gonna hurt.

30:28.723 --> 30:31.992
- You were shot, too.
- Yeah, but I was dressed for it.

30:32.026 --> 30:34.561
I want you to keep
pressure on that, okay?

30:34.596 --> 30:36.597
And I'm gonna get some help.

30:40.435 --> 30:41.735
Oh, come on.

30:41.803 --> 30:43.871
I can never get service
in this building.

30:43.905 --> 30:46.507
[breathing heavily]

30:46.574 --> 30:48.408
Okay. Okay.

30:49.844 --> 30:51.311
Okay. Look.

30:51.346 --> 30:52.613
I've always wanted to
use of these things.

30:52.647 --> 30:55.349
Okay? [grunts]

30:58.019 --> 31:01.755
- No.
- It's all right. [panting]

31:01.790 --> 31:03.924
It's all right. Okay?

31:03.958 --> 31:05.859
[metal creaks]

31:05.927 --> 31:08.896
My team knows where we are, okay?

31:11.466 --> 31:13.333
They'll be here in no time.

31:13.368 --> 31:16.403
[gasping]

31:16.437 --> 31:18.438
It's all right, baby. Hang on.

31:18.473 --> 31:21.161
- You find Jane yet?
- Nobody's heard from her.

31:21.162 --> 31:22.442
She's not picking up her phone.

31:22.477 --> 31:24.244
I'm triangulating pings
from her last call,

31:24.279 --> 31:25.879
but it's still a
six-block radius on grand.

31:25.914 --> 31:28.515
- We should have something soon.
- No, let's go now.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.851
I want to be close by when
she does call. Come on.

31:30.885 --> 31:32.386
<i>[sighs] Come on!</i>

31:39.961 --> 31:44.531
I took auto shop when
I was in high school.

31:44.566 --> 31:50.504
- I hot-wired a Volvo for my final.
- No more jokes, please.

31:53.575 --> 31:54.808
[ringing]

31:54.843 --> 31:56.810
Who's joking? Huh?

Connelly Group.

32:01.583 --> 32:03.050
This is Detective Jane Rizzoli.

32:03.084 --> 32:04.518
I'm in an elevator in
one of your buildings,

32:04.586 --> 32:06.487
and I need assistance,
both police and ambulance.

32:06.521 --> 32:09.056
Copy that. First, I
need your exact location.

32:09.090 --> 32:11.225
You have my location. I'm on a
phone in one of your buildings.

32:11.259 --> 32:12.760
<i>Check your screen.</i>

32:12.827 --> 32:15.329
Connelly Group manages 63
buildings in and around Boston.

32:15.397 --> 32:17.231
Uh, it ... it's the
one under construction.

32:17.265 --> 32:18.532
We have eight under construction.

32:18.566 --> 32:20.134
None of them are wired in.

32:20.168 --> 32:22.036
Okay. Okay. I-it's the
one on Grand Street.

32:22.070 --> 32:25.072
- We have two on Grand.
- You call the Boston police department,

32:25.106 --> 32:26.407
and you tell them there's
an officer in distress.

32:26.441 --> 32:29.576
Inform Sergeant Detective Korsak.
Send them to this street.

32:29.644 --> 32:31.278
Patch me through to Dr. Maura Isles

32:31.312 --> 32:33.347
in the medical examiner's
office, and do it now!

32:33.381 --> 32:35.382
Got it. 
Stay on the line.

32:35.417 --> 32:38.686
[siren wailing]

32:38.720 --> 32:40.354
Try making a left.

32:40.422 --> 32:42.056
I don't want to risk
getting stuck in traffic.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.757
If we take the bridge,
we can get a clear signal.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.192
[cellphone buzzes]

32:45.226 --> 32:47.194
Rizzoli.

32:47.228 --> 32:49.063
Yeah.

32:49.097 --> 32:53.500
Okay. Okay.
Got it.

32:53.535 --> 32:55.536
Jane's in a building on
the 2000 block on Grand.

32:55.603 --> 32:58.172
She's stuck in an elevator with Tasha.

32:58.206 --> 33:00.708
Get more cars there fast.
Nina, call an ambulance.

33:04.079 --> 33:05.646
Did you hear about the girl?

33:05.680 --> 33:07.748
The 14-year-old who came up
with the new energy source?

33:07.782 --> 33:09.016
[telephone ringing]

33:09.050 --> 33:11.018
Um, sorry. One sec.

33:11.052 --> 33:12.419
[ringing continues]

33:12.454 --> 33:16.523
Ah, no, forget it. [chuckles]
What was the energy source?

33:16.558 --> 33:18.292
So, body heat.

33:18.326 --> 33:20.294
It took her four months to
come up with the algorithm,

33:20.328 --> 33:21.995
but she actually came
up with the idea...

33:22.030 --> 33:23.130
[cellphone buzzing]

33:23.198 --> 33:25.065
...during a dream, and ...

33:25.100 --> 33:28.368
- Get it.
- No. Go on.

33:28.403 --> 33:29.770
[buzzing continues]

33:29.804 --> 33:31.805
I'm sorry. Okay.

33:33.675 --> 33:36.343
- Hello.
- Dr. Isles, this is Tim Curran.

33:36.377 --> 33:38.078
I'm a security guard
with the Connelly Group.

33:38.113 --> 33:40.080
I have an officer in distress
in need of assistance.

33:40.115 --> 33:42.483
- Put him on.
- You're connected.

33:42.517 --> 33:45.018
Maura, it's Jane. I'm in an elevator.

33:45.053 --> 33:49.223
- Jane? Are you okay?
- I'm with Tasha. And she's hurt.

33:49.257 --> 33:52.159
She got a gunshot to
the brachial artery.

33:52.193 --> 33:53.360
Is everything all right?

33:53.394 --> 33:56.330
Okay, Jane, you need to apply
direct pressure to her wound.

33:56.364 --> 33:59.333
- Yeah, yeah, I did that.
- Good. Now, where are you?

33:59.400 --> 34:01.835
- Grand Street.  I don't know the address.
- It's the 2000 block.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.637
- Jane, are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:03.671 --> 34:06.429
Uh, he took a shot at me, but
I was wearing my vest. I'm fine.

34:06.464 --> 34:09.009
I'm coming.
Sir, keep us connected.

34:09.077 --> 34:13.013
- And if you lose me, call me back.
- I'll drive.

34:20.386 --> 34:22.353
[breathing heavily]

34:22.388 --> 34:24.289
What else can I do?

34:24.322 --> 34:25.590
<i>Maura: Jane, you've got
to get her out of there.</i>

34:25.658 --> 34:27.205
<i>Jane: I can't. We're trapped.</i>

34:27.239 --> 34:29.728
- Has she lost a lot of blood?
- Yeah.

34:29.762 --> 34:31.730
Okay, she's gonna go into shock,
so you need to keep her awake,

34:31.764 --> 34:33.764
and she needs an ambulance right away.

34:33.799 --> 34:35.567
[sighs]

34:35.601 --> 34:37.735
Okay. Hold on.

34:46.512 --> 34:48.380
Okay, Tasha.

34:48.414 --> 34:50.382
[grunts]

34:50.416 --> 34:51.850
I got to leave you for a second, okay?

34:51.884 --> 34:56.221
I want you to talk to my
friend Dr. Isles, okay? Okay.

34:56.255 --> 34:59.190
<i>Maura: Hi, Tasha.</i>

34:59.225 --> 35:02.694
- [weakly] Dr. Isles.
- No, call me Maura.

35:02.762 --> 35:05.563
You know, in the second grade,
I had a friend named Tasha.

35:05.598 --> 35:08.500
And she had this dream of
becoming an electrical engineer.

35:08.534 --> 35:13.171
- What do you want to be?
- I haven't decided yet.

35:13.205 --> 35:15.640
Well, we all have dreams,
even if we're afraid

35:15.674 --> 35:19.144
that if we say them out loud,
they might become less real.

35:19.211 --> 35:20.545
I don't know you.

35:20.579 --> 35:23.448
Which is why I'm the
perfect person to tell.

35:23.482 --> 35:27.619
- Tasha? Are you there?
- Doctor...

35:27.653 --> 35:33.758
- Please ... call me Maura.
- I want to be a doctor...

35:33.826 --> 35:37.662
An oncologist ... so I can
save someone else's life.

35:39.231 --> 35:40.632
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

35:40.666 --> 35:41.599
Hey.

35:41.634 --> 35:43.802
You stay awake, okay?

35:46.739 --> 35:48.540
Oh, god.

35:48.574 --> 35:51.876
Here.
Here.

35:51.944 --> 35:55.847
Okay. I'm gonna go ... hey.
All right?

35:55.881 --> 35:58.383
Maura, you just keep talking, all right?

35:58.417 --> 36:02.253
- Don't stop talking.
- I can do that.

36:02.288 --> 36:05.590
Here. Okay?
I'll be right back.

36:05.658 --> 36:06.658
[smooches]

36:06.725 --> 36:08.426
Hang on.

36:08.461 --> 36:11.196
<i>Tasha, did I tell you that
the pioneering oncologist</i>

36:11.230 --> 36:13.598
<i>who elevated chemotherapy
to a viable treatment option</i>

36:13.632 --> 36:15.600
<i>was a woman ... Dr. Jane Wright?</i>

36:15.634 --> 36:20.505
- She died in 2013.
- Yes. She was 93.

36:20.539 --> 36:25.510
- And she was black.
- Yes, she was.

36:31.517 --> 36:36.421
My dream isn't a dream.
It's a path.

36:36.455 --> 36:38.456
Dr. Jane Wright's path.

36:38.491 --> 36:42.927
It's an excellent path, Tasha,
and I'm sure you'll walk it.

36:46.632 --> 36:47.899
[panting]

37:03.148 --> 37:04.415
[whirring]

37:07.319 --> 37:08.419
[alarm rings]

37:08.454 --> 37:11.723
[elevator whirring]

37:32.645 --> 37:34.512
<i>Tasha, are you there?</i>

37:48.360 --> 37:51.896
<i>Maura: Tasha, you need
to keep talking to me.</i>

37:51.931 --> 37:56.168
Tasha!
All right, go faster.

37:56.203 --> 37:58.169
<i>- Jack: Geez.
-  We're almost there, Tasha.</i>

37:58.237 --> 38:00.872
<i>I need you to stay with me.</i>

38:00.906 --> 38:03.808
[sirens wailing, tires screeching]

38:08.997 --> 38:11.699
- Korsak: What?
- There's two.

38:11.733 --> 38:14.335
Take that one.
Get me if you find her.

38:14.403 --> 38:16.103
Stay off the walkie.

38:16.138 --> 38:17.772
We don't want this guy
finding us before we find Jane.

38:17.806 --> 38:19.340
I'll keep tracing her phone.

38:21.076 --> 38:23.744
Nina, get him. Jane's in here.

38:40.295 --> 38:42.930
Elevators?
Look.

38:44.199 --> 38:45.699
Stairs.

39:08.323 --> 39:10.591
[sirens wailing]

39:10.625 --> 39:12.193
[tires screech]

39:15.197 --> 39:17.865
Sorry, ma'am, but I can't
let you through the tape.

39:17.899 --> 39:19.767
I'm Dr. Maura Isles, the
chief medical examiner.

39:19.801 --> 39:21.368
I know the condition
of the people inside.

39:21.403 --> 39:23.871
I need to work with the EMTs
to prepare proper triage.

39:23.905 --> 39:26.273
- Okay. Thank you.
- Uh, sorry, sir.

39:26.308 --> 39:30.111
- I'm ... I'm with her.
- Okay.

39:30.145 --> 39:32.146
- Wait for me.
- I want to help.

39:32.180 --> 39:37.785
You are helping.
You're here.

40:06.381 --> 40:07.948
[alarm rings]

40:09.017 --> 40:10.851
[grunts]

40:23.198 --> 40:25.032
[gunshot]

40:25.100 --> 40:27.168
[metal clanks]

40:27.202 --> 40:28.802
[coughs]

40:28.837 --> 40:30.271
[gasps]

40:30.305 --> 40:32.840
[groans]

40:32.874 --> 40:34.675
Janie?!

40:34.709 --> 40:36.443
Jane. Jane?

40:36.478 --> 40:38.179
Janie? Hey.

40:38.213 --> 40:40.347
[whimpers]

40:43.985 --> 40:46.420
[police radio chatter]

40:50.058 --> 40:53.360
- Hey.
- What? Where...?

40:53.428 --> 40:56.730
The EMTs are working on her, Jane.

40:58.099 --> 41:00.034
I'll see you at the hospital.

41:26.795 --> 41:30.197
You did good, Jane.
You did really good.
