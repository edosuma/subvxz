WEBVTT

00:01.419 --> 00:03.879
<i>Previously,
on</i> Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.130 --> 00:06.632
It seems Radcliffe is keeping
our team alive in this Framework,

00:06.757 --> 00:07.967
<i>so we have to hook up with our people</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:09.552
<i>and find out where on Earth
their bodies are being held.</i>

00:09.635 --> 00:10.761
And rescue them.

00:13.639 --> 00:14.974
Lincoln.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.101
- Ward.
- Don't forget this.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.311
You were the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.480
And now you're trapped
in a virtual prison,

00:21.689 --> 00:23.774
- and I am here to wake you up...
- Put that away,

00:23.941 --> 00:25.151
before we both get arrested.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.028
Yes, I'd like to report a subversive.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.946
A woman with a S.H.I.E.L.D. ID.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.158
Really? I want any and all assets
in the area on this.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.076
Hydra is after you.
We have to get somewhere safe.

00:34.618 --> 00:35.661
Ladies.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.038
Is she your source in the Resistance?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.123
Ward, I have nothing to do
with the Resistance!

00:39.331 --> 00:40.416
Well, I do.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.210
- Good evening, Madame.
- Leopold.

00:43.461 --> 00:45.004
These... subversives...

00:45.296 --> 00:46.922
apparently, they've got a mole
inside Hydra.

00:47.006 --> 00:48.007
Coulson...

00:48.424 --> 00:50.926
remember me. You're the closest thing
I have to family.

00:51.886 --> 00:52.970
Daisy?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.439
So, we're both from the "real world,"

01:04.230 --> 01:07.359
we're S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,
our bodies are being held captive,

01:07.610 --> 01:10.780
and this is all a virtual prison
built to keep us sedated.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.577
- Am I missing anything?
- No, that's about the gist of it.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.499
I knew I wasn't crazy.

01:21.916 --> 01:25.336
Hydra lies about everything.
The news? It's all fake.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.047
Take the Cambridge Incident.
It was a setup.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.174
That girl shouldn't have been
at that school in the first place.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.760
Where we're from, she died.
This never happened.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.723
Hey, Mr Coulson, my homework was done,

01:37.848 --> 01:40.893
- I swear, but then my dad made me...
- Amy, we've been over this.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.770
Until first bell, this is my time.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.855
Right. Okay. Jeez! Sorry.

01:45.856 --> 01:46.982
It's okay.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.822
Hydra used Cambridge to take control,

01:53.197 --> 01:56.158
in the name of law and order
to justify everything.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.535
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.537
I knew if anyone would understand,
it'd be you.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.540
I would've figured it out a long time ago
if it wasn't for the mind-control soap.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.333
Yeah. Wait, what?

02:05.292 --> 02:08.336
That blue soap everyone uses?
Hydra loads it up with chemicals.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.799
It seeps into our bloodstream,
implants false memories into our brains.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.009
They want us to believe
this is a magical place.

02:14.718 --> 02:15.803
But don't worry, I'm clear.

02:16.554 --> 02:17.805
I make my own soap now.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.225
No, I think that you're talking
about Project Tahiti.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.977
They messed with your head a little bit...

02:23.144 --> 02:24.270
...which is why you

02:24.353 --> 02:26.355
probably remember some things, uh...

02:27.523 --> 02:30.192
Why don't we put the soap theories on hold
just for one second, okay?

02:32.862 --> 02:34.363
- Yeah?
- We got a problem.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.575
- Oh, you have no idea.
- Something big's going down over here.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.785
They're sending a unit to pick up
your teacher friend.

02:41.871 --> 02:43.289
You're gonna need a substitute.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.177
Come on. Don't quit on me. Not now.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.554
Not now.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.271
How did you beat me?

03:08.022 --> 03:10.482
The human brain peaks
as early as age 24.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.444
Face it, you're slowing down, Dad.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.323
Oh, is that right?

03:18.115 --> 03:21.410
Well, tell me, show-off, what'd you use
for an electronic speed control?

03:21.827 --> 03:25.289
Well, I sort of found something by school,
in the park.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.210
A Hydra drone?

03:29.668 --> 03:31.503
Maybe I borrowed a part or two.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.466
Hope, you know better.
We don't mess around with those guys.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.052
It was all crashed and messed up.
I made sure no one was looking...

03:38.260 --> 03:40.387
No, no, we stay off Hydra's radar,

03:40.804 --> 03:43.349
we keep our heads down
and follow their rules always.

03:43.933 --> 03:45.726
- Always!
- I know.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.020
I'm really, really sorry, Daddy.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.107
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.195
Just want you to be more careful,
all right?

03:57.404 --> 03:58.405
I'll tell you what.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.867
I'll take the drone parts back later,

04:02.534 --> 04:06.705
and then you and I can try
to get mine working together.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.667
But you got to promise
to go easy on your old man.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.003
- No promises.
- No promises? No? No?

04:13.212 --> 04:15.381
Get out of here. Go on. Go get your bag.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.132
We'll be late for the bus.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.432
All right, Sparkplug...

04:26.558 --> 04:27.726
ten o'clock.

04:28.352 --> 04:29.853
Easy! Harley-Davidson.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.147
- Engine?
- Twin cam, 88.

04:32.398 --> 04:34.066
Ooh! That's my girl.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.825
Keep your head down, do what they say.
I'm right here with you.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.288
- All right, line it up!
- Move it, move it!

04:47.371 --> 04:50.124
- Hurry it up!
- IDs out! You know the drill.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.463
Keep your mouth shut
and get your IDs out now!

05:01.218 --> 05:02.386
Got to be contraband.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.555
They busted my neighbour
for a laptop last night.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.725
- The drone, it's in my bag.
- What?

05:08.225 --> 05:10.936
I was gonna take it back myself
so you wouldn't get in trouble.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.025
I'll handle this.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.402
- We got a runner!
- Freeze!

05:18.569 --> 05:19.570
Get him!

05:21.238 --> 05:22.489
Hands behind your back!

05:22.990 --> 05:25.242
He's on the list, potential Inhuman.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.161
Take him away.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.258
It's okay.

05:44.053 --> 05:45.095
It's okay.

05:48.474 --> 05:49.850
- Hi.
- Oh!

05:50.851 --> 05:52.978
Hi. It's me again, Phil Coulson.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.483
- I called Hydra on you. My bad.
- Water under the proverbial bridge.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.193
I'm so glad to see you, sir.

06:01.362 --> 06:05.491
Apparently, in the real world,
I have a robot hand. Pretty cool, right?

06:06.200 --> 06:07.785
And here, he makes his own soap.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.495
- How about that?
- I do.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.246
- You should, too.
- Okay.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.958
We need to move.
Hydra came back for Coulson.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.211
Ward warned us away,
but we barely made it out.

06:17.669 --> 06:18.962
Oh, thank goodness for Grant Ward.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.673
I don't love it either, but this is
the second time he's helped us.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.678
And so, I hate to say this,
but I think we can trust him.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.224
Until we can't. Betraying those closest
to him is his signature move.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.767
For now, we just need to get
somewhere safe.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.019
Ward set up a time and place
for us to meet the Resistance.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.938
It's a whole password-exchange thing.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.732
Bona fides? I always wanted to do that.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.818
Or, I've been thinking...

06:41.151 --> 06:42.319
what if I reached out to Fitz?

06:42.611 --> 06:44.530
Simmons, we've... we've been over this.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.281
If you were able to get through to Coulson

06:46.448 --> 06:48.200
then surely I could get Fitz
to remember me.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.994
Fitz is not the same. He's different here.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.039
This reality may be upside down,
but Fitz is still Fitz.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.290
He's still a good person.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.376
Who happens to be second in command
at Hydra.

06:57.626 --> 07:01.505
Yeah, which means he has resources,
not to mention Framework expertise,

07:01.630 --> 07:04.508
which we'll need to get out
of Radcliffe's Hydra snow globe.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.094
Holden Radcliffe, the scientist? I...

07:07.761 --> 07:10.889
I... I saw something a while back
and I cut it out. I...

07:11.348 --> 07:12.266
Yeah, here it is.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.311
"Famed Hydra scientist
working on Inhuman cure."

07:16.728 --> 07:19.565
Something felt off about him.
Do you know him? Do we know him?

07:20.023 --> 07:23.026
- Why would Radcliffe be in here?
- I don't know. But think about it.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.070
He built the Framework, which means...

07:25.195 --> 07:26.905
- He can help us get out.
- Yeah, one catch.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.032
Nobody's seen him
since this photo was taken.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.701
You guys meet up with Ward's contact.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.036
I'll go back to the Triskelion
and get a location on Radcliffe.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.998
- Daisy, it's too dangerous.
- I'll be fine. I'll be in and out.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.249
No one will even know I'm there.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.293
<i>It's only a matter
of time before we find her.</i>

07:39.960 --> 07:42.087
- We've detained several Inhuman sympath...
- Dismissed, Agent.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.136
All this for one subversive?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.306
Why won't you let me help you?

07:52.556 --> 07:54.099
I need you focused on your work right now.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.767
Project Looking Glass
is ahead of schedule.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.019
Tell me, what's really going on?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.480
It's fine. I'm handling it.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.273
Ophelia, I know that look.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.442
You're worried.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.070
Who is she?

08:09.114 --> 08:10.574
No one. She doesn't matter.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.890
She's plotting against me.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.437
I need to find her and expose anyone
who's helping her.

08:45.651 --> 08:46.860
I'll send my team.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.404
Consider the threat eliminated.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.700
You'd really do anything for me,
wouldn't you?

09:00.624 --> 09:02.167
I'd cross the universe for you.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.577
What the hell are you doing?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.996
I got a lead on someone
who could take down this whole place.

09:40.122 --> 09:43.083
It's not safe here. All right?
I think they're on to me.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.795
Listen, this will go a lot faster
if you would quit mouth-breathing on me.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.473
Madame Hydra's restricted files?

09:59.558 --> 10:00.601
You have lost your mind.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.062
The soap made me do it. Let's go.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.232
The soap?

10:13.071 --> 10:14.072
Hold it!

10:15.449 --> 10:17.909
Skye, you need to come with us.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.958
I'll take May, you take the others.
When we get to the door...

10:25.375 --> 10:27.127
Get this to Simmons.
She'll know what to do.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.838
- Skye...
- I'll be fine. Go.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.811
According to Ward's intel,
the drone should leave in five seconds.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.857
This Ward guy, where we're from,
he's a friend of ours?

10:49.358 --> 10:51.401
Uh... He was.

10:51.902 --> 10:52.986
Didn't end well.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.696
Oh!

11:01.745 --> 11:03.163
I take it you're our contact?

11:04.498 --> 11:07.668
For the season, it's been unusually rainy.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.506
Rain or shine, the man with the umbrella
is always ready.

11:17.552 --> 11:18.804
What? Did I say it wrong?

11:19.554 --> 11:21.640
Hands out front. Wrists together.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.730
- Honestly, is this really necessary?
- Oh, cool!

11:50.961 --> 11:52.337
I'm Jeffrey Mace.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.090
Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.347
Sorry about the hoods...
trust is a luxury these days.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.891
That being said, Ward vouched for you,

12:05.058 --> 12:08.270
- so I'm happy to provide you sanctuary.
- Thank you, sir.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.313
My name is Jemma Simmons,
and this is...

12:10.522 --> 12:13.817
Phil Coulson. Wow.
I can't believe it's really you.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.320
The Patriot!
The Inhuman leader of the Resistance.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.490
- He's kind of a big deal!
- Uh. Jeffrey's fine.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.909
The Patriot's a little much for my taste.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.747
Man, I dreamed about
what your suit would look like.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.667
I made a few sketches,
but this is actually way cooler.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.170
This place... what happened here?

12:33.795 --> 12:37.174
For about 70 years after World War II,
nothing.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.925
No one even knew it was here.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.262
But then a couple years back,
a brave agent named Billy Koenig

12:42.387 --> 12:44.347
gave his life getting me the location.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.435
It's taken all that time just to get it
operational again.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.771
Got to say, the whole Rebel Alliance
aesthetics'

12:50.896 --> 12:53.190
- really working for me.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.067
I think? This way, please.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.949
The early days were tough.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.744
A lot of good agents died for this.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.291
Agent Burrows.

13:12.542 --> 13:16.463
Sir, it's bad out there.
And, uh... we lost Agent Cook.

13:17.422 --> 13:18.590
I'm sorry.

13:19.257 --> 13:22.928
We honour him by continuing the fight.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.522
- Who are these people?
- Potentials.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.107
Some of them
have the Inhuman gene...

13:36.900 --> 13:38.527
or they had a relative who did.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.111
Hydra's hunting them.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.447
It's all we can do to find them first,

13:42.697 --> 13:45.617
give them shelter, and relocate them
somewhere safe.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.539
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.793
It's been too long, sir.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.464
What's happened?

14:00.465 --> 14:01.550
They got Skye.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.971
- Is this gonna take long?
- We have a mission.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.932
Madame Hydra's office
requested you specifically.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.684
Why me?

14:12.143 --> 14:14.563
The target was spotted
via drone yesterday.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.690
She's been reaching out
to leaders of the Resistance

14:16.898 --> 14:19.067
and is planning a major attack.

14:21.570 --> 14:26.700
Capture any subversives found on site,
but do not underestimate this woman.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.911
Lethal force is authorised, if necessary.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.204
Did you know about this?

14:32.122 --> 14:34.749
And believe me,
we will defeat these terrorists,

14:35.166 --> 14:37.002
and we will make
our society great again.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.461
Hail Hydra.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.844
He was Inhuman, that man they took?

14:46.595 --> 14:47.762
Does that mean he's bad?

14:50.265 --> 14:51.558
I don't know, Sparkplug.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.227
Do we hate Inhumans?

14:55.645 --> 14:56.646
No.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.149
They're people, just like you and me.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.611
But if they didn't do anything wrong,
why are they all being arrested?

15:04.863 --> 15:08.950
You're smarter than most kids your age,
and you pick up on things pretty quickly.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.703
But I don't want you worrying
about this stuff, okay?

15:14.497 --> 15:16.374
What would've happened
if they'd looked in my bag?

15:16.875 --> 15:19.002
Then I would've taken care of it,
'cause that's my job.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.839
Tell you what, how about if we...

15:23.882 --> 15:26.968
- make some popcorn and watch a video?
<i>- Chopping Mall?</i>

15:27.844 --> 15:30.472
- Again with that silly robot movie?
- Don't pretend you don't love it.

15:31.973 --> 15:35.518
Okay, okay. But I'm still fast-forwarding
through the bad parts.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.359
I don't know. It all happened so fast.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.569
From everything you've told me,
Skye's tough as hell.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.946
She can handle herself in there.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.615
Before they took her,
did she get a location on Radcliffe?

15:53.495 --> 15:55.830
You know, Skye hasn't been herself
ever since you showed up.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.541
What is it that you're really after?

15:58.833 --> 16:00.835
You, of all people,
the Hydra double agent,

16:01.002 --> 16:02.337
are doubting my loyalty.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.255
- That is rich.
- But don't forget,

16:04.464 --> 16:08.176
you're only here because I trust him,
not you.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.971
Fine. You want to question me?

16:11.763 --> 16:14.808
When Hydra wiped out the Academy
and people were dying, I was there.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.478
I fought and took a bullet.
I had to claw my way out of a mass grave.

16:19.354 --> 16:20.897
How's that for loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D.?

16:26.111 --> 16:27.404
I apologise.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.371
Ogygia?

16:37.080 --> 16:39.916
These coordinates they're east of Bermuda.
There shouldn't be anything out there.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.503
- Who is this Radcliffe?
- He's a scientist.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.921
Skye said he could take down Hydra.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.215
What does that mean?

16:47.757 --> 16:50.260
I can't be sure, but we need to find him
as quickly as possible.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.597
I'm sorry. With all that's going on,
I can't send a team today.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.016
Then send us.

16:58.143 --> 17:01.021
With all due respect,
this is a spy organisation...

17:01.563 --> 17:04.648
- and you're a teacher.
- Seems you need all the help you can get.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.902
- Skye did risk everything for this.
- They may have a point, sir.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.696
I can pilot and supervise.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.915
All this because of one subversive?

17:22.959 --> 17:25.086
- Seems a little extreme.
- Be quiet.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.880
Do your job.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.764
What's going on?

17:40.435 --> 17:41.478
Daddy!

17:42.312 --> 17:43.563
Leave him alone!

17:43.730 --> 17:45.482
- Daddy!
- Let her go! Let her go!

17:45.690 --> 17:46.816
Daddy, help me!

17:47.067 --> 17:48.985
- Daddy, help me! Daddy!
- Please, please. She's just a kid.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.112
- She's just a kid!
- Daddy!

17:51.321 --> 17:52.489
Let her go! No!

17:54.866 --> 17:57.410
The hangar was in total disrepair
when we first found it.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.454
We've had to steal
what vehicles we could.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.082
Someday, this could really be special.

18:04.375 --> 18:08.213
Imagine a fleet of Quinjets
launching from here.

18:08.922 --> 18:09.964
Imagine that.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.050
Sir.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.510
Good luck out there.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.345
Thank you.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.225
Why didn't you tell them
this reality's fake?

18:20.642 --> 18:22.602
- Keep your voice down.
- You lied to them.

18:22.977 --> 18:26.397
It wasn't a lie, it was an omission.
Not everyone is ready for that truth.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.316
- Oh, but I am?
- Yes.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.944
So far, you're the only one
who remembers the way things should be.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.696
- It's only fragments.
- Fragments have got you this far.

18:36.199 --> 18:37.700
We liberated this guy last year.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.211
This is a Quinjet?

18:49.254 --> 18:52.966
Yeah. And that fleet Mace described?
You commanded it.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.302
Except yours were loads nicer,
and you wouldn't believe Zephyr One.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.014
<i>This has to be a mistake.</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:02.600
We didn't do anything.
We... we shouldn't be here.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.562
You're in a lot of trouble.

19:06.271 --> 19:07.313
But we're innocent.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.151
We keep our heads down,
we obey the rules...

19:11.317 --> 19:13.778
People who haven't done anything
don't end up here.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.697
We don't want to cause any trouble.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.909
And Hope? She's just a kid.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.289
That doesn't mean she's innocent.

19:27.709 --> 19:28.835
Please...

19:31.171 --> 19:32.422
I'll do anything.

19:35.717 --> 19:39.053
So, this Radcliffe... is he dangerous?

19:41.264 --> 19:42.348
Maybe not physically.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.518
But sometimes the greatest threats
are the ones right in front of you.

19:51.649 --> 19:52.692
I'm sorry.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.819
Excuse me?

19:56.571 --> 19:58.656
- I should've never left Skye.
- Oh.

19:59.574 --> 20:00.742
I'm sure she'll be okay.

20:01.409 --> 20:04.329
Which I keep telling myself,
but if anything happens...

20:06.164 --> 20:07.415
I'd never forgive myself.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.667
I'd die for her.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.504
Why don't I give you a minute?

20:19.969 --> 20:21.262
Everything all right?

20:22.847 --> 20:24.724
It's been years since I've even been
on a plane.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.435
It's perfectly normal to be nervous.

20:28.561 --> 20:32.023
For the longest time,
I just wanted someone to believe me,

20:32.690 --> 20:35.443
- and tell me I wasn't crazy.
- You are not crazy.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.487
I live alone and make my own soap.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.325
I... uh, it's quaint. Hipster, even.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.369
That's not how my ex-wife saw it.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.872
Who am I kidding?
I'm not remotely qualified to be here.

20:48.206 --> 20:49.374
I know the real Coulson...

20:50.124 --> 20:52.377
and I believe in you,
even if you don't just now.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.297
You're exactly where you're meant to be.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.299
Thirty minutes out.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.359
Leopold?

21:17.777 --> 21:18.903
What's wrong?

21:23.116 --> 21:24.784
Turns out your new subversive,

21:25.576 --> 21:27.078
was executed at the Academy.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.205
But I suppose you knew that already,
didn't you?

21:31.874 --> 21:34.210
- I can explain.
- So, she's an Inhuman then?

21:36.838 --> 21:38.298
What else have you been keeping from me?

21:40.341 --> 21:42.218
This woman is not from here.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.305
She crossed over from the other side.

21:52.770 --> 21:55.023
- I thought that was impossible.
- As did I.

21:56.399 --> 21:59.402
So this is why you've been so keen
on finishing Project Looking Glass.

22:00.111 --> 22:03.156
The people from that world
want to destroy what we've built.

22:03.698 --> 22:04.949
I was only trying to protect you.

22:07.368 --> 22:08.953
You never talk about your time there.

22:10.371 --> 22:11.581
Why?

22:12.123 --> 22:14.292
Tell me the truth. You owe me that much.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.423
Over there, the worst thing happened.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.593
S.H.I.E.L.D. won the war.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.470
Hydra lost.

22:26.429 --> 22:27.722
I was their slave.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.559
Treated as less than human.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.189
When I escaped,
I hoped they couldn't follow me, but...

22:36.356 --> 22:37.523
Here they are.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.612
If I can't return there
and defeat my enemies...

22:43.946 --> 22:45.031
we'll never be safe.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.869
Everything I do is so that you and I...

22:51.120 --> 22:52.288
can be together.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.254
We'll finish this later. Come.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.359
I'm Skye. What's your name?

23:22.777 --> 23:23.903
Hope Mackenzie.

23:24.612 --> 23:25.822
Hope...

23:27.281 --> 23:29.867
- You're the Hope that he lost.
- He didn't lose me.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.702
I was taken by you people.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.580
My Dad follows the rules.
He's a good person.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.208
I'm sure he is.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.795
- Then let us go home.
- I wish it was that simple.

23:41.629 --> 23:42.839
It's not my call.

23:43.756 --> 23:47.385
Dad warned me not to mess around
with that drone, but I didn't listen.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.971
- This is all my fault. I...
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

23:50.805 --> 23:52.348
Your dad's gonna be all right.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.768
- I promise.
- Please help my dad.

23:56.394 --> 23:59.313
Don't let anything happen to him. Please.

24:15.913 --> 24:19.208
- Get anything from the girl?
- She's scared. What about her dad?

24:19.500 --> 24:21.335
I haven't broken him... yet.

24:33.848 --> 24:34.974
I was just with Hope.

24:35.766 --> 24:36.851
She's safe.

24:39.061 --> 24:40.188
That's one special girl.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.233
Thank you.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.946
Listen, we need to talk.

24:57.663 --> 24:58.998
Do you know who I am?

24:59.582 --> 25:00.666
You're Daisy Johnson.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.461
We're both S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.963
Yes.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.508
Yes. Oh, thank God.

25:09.717 --> 25:10.760
Okay.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.679
We need to get you out of here,
reconnect with Coulson and Simmons.

25:13.888 --> 25:14.889
Definitely.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.682
Yo-Yo is with us on the outside.
She's safe.

25:16.974 --> 25:19.101
You have no idea
how worried she is about you.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.272
You don't...

25:24.190 --> 25:25.358
know who she is.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.485
Uh...

25:29.820 --> 25:31.030
And me?

25:32.615 --> 25:33.783
Do you know me?

25:36.244 --> 25:37.286
I'm sorry.

25:38.746 --> 25:40.957
That's what the other agent
told me to say.

26:08.025 --> 26:10.403
Lock down the elevators. Find her!

26:18.869 --> 26:21.247
Simple extraction. We grab him and go.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.293
- Keep your eyes open.
- I'll do the talking.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.878
What about me? What should I do?

26:28.337 --> 26:30.715
Just... try to not to get yourself killed.

26:33.009 --> 26:36.637
Consider it a precaution.
A "break glass in case of emergency."

26:53.613 --> 26:54.614
Drop it.

26:56.782 --> 27:00.119
Hive? No. It can't be.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.538
Hello, again, traitor.

27:04.332 --> 27:05.374
Surprise.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.127
You shouldn't be here. None of you.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.630
Uh-uh. That's close enough, pal.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.924
Oh, you're not Hive at all.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.053
You're the one who came before.
I never did meet him.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.721
This is not a social visit.

27:19.847 --> 27:20.848
Oh, Jemma,

27:21.223 --> 27:24.185
if only you knew
the trials and tribulations I've endured.

27:24.477 --> 27:27.313
I am fresh out of sympathy
for liars who kidnap my friends

27:27.563 --> 27:29.065
and replace them with killer androids.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.150
Don't forget about
implanting bogus memories

27:31.317 --> 27:33.903
and letting me think I'm off my gourd.
Not cool, bro.

27:34.236 --> 27:35.738
Catch up later. We need to move.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.783
It's all become so very complicated.
I never meant to hurt anyone.

27:39.075 --> 27:40.951
Right now, I don't give a damn
about what you meant.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.079
You're going to help us find
our friends and escape.

27:43.454 --> 27:47.208
My dear, I'm afraid there is no escape
from this place.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.502
<i>Sector seven clear,</i>

27:49.585 --> 27:50.920
<i>moving on to the next ward.</i>

27:54.465 --> 27:55.633
Going down?

28:09.772 --> 28:10.773
There's no way out.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.487
- It's over.
- Don't move.

28:17.405 --> 28:18.489
Give me your hands.

28:26.288 --> 28:27.957
<i>This isn't the world I'd intended.</i>

28:28.290 --> 28:30.334
Things have gone dreadfully wrong.

28:30.751 --> 28:34.130
- Maybe not so much for you.
- I promise you, this is a gilded cage.

28:34.839 --> 28:38.217
One can only drink so many Mai Tais,
watch so many sunsets...

28:38.384 --> 28:39.844
Oh, stuff it. You're in early retirement

28:40.010 --> 28:42.054
while the rest of your world
tears itself apart.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.140
I assure you,
my intentions were pure.

28:44.640 --> 28:49.353
The Framework was to be a paradise,
a pleasant forever-after.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.355
All right, story time is over.

28:51.605 --> 28:54.150
- You're coming with us.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.

28:54.734 --> 28:55.818
That wasn't a request.

28:59.113 --> 29:00.156
Who is that?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.450
No one. It's unimportant.

29:03.576 --> 29:04.952
You guys watch him. I'll go and get her.

29:05.035 --> 29:07.204
No, you can't drag her into this!
It'll only confuse her.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.123
She doesn't remember the other world.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.458
It's Agnes.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.001
Agnes was dying.

29:12.877 --> 29:15.171
In order to save her, I had to bring
her consciousness into the Framework.

29:15.463 --> 29:17.882
- And her body?
- Deceased, I'm afraid.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.885
We gave her a burial at sea.
It was very emotional.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.763
The Framework is all Agnes has left.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.057
Okay, what the hell is he talking about?

29:27.308 --> 29:29.602
- To be honest, he lost me there, too.
- As a matter of fact,

29:30.019 --> 29:31.771
she's not the only one
in that particular boat.

29:32.772 --> 29:35.858
Aida... sort of killed me as well.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.109
What?

29:37.485 --> 29:39.403
How did she go against
her programming?

29:39.737 --> 29:42.114
She found a loophole.
I mean, it was really rather clever.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.158
If I weren't dead already,
I'd be impressed.

29:44.325 --> 29:46.076
We're getting that woman
and we're going.

29:46.327 --> 29:47.953
We can sort this out at HQ.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.290
I never wanted any of this to happen.
I only wanted to do good.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.167
Then actually do good.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.669
Tell me where Aida is keeping our friends.

29:58.464 --> 30:03.260
The Russian has a base on a...
a drilling platform in the Baltic.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.347
Go and save them and leave us in peace.

30:06.722 --> 30:07.848
How do we get out?

30:08.349 --> 30:09.892
Did you build an exit
back to the real world?

30:10.142 --> 30:12.436
Of course, I did, but I suspect
Aida's discovered it by now.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.647
You'll just have to go
however you came in.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.857
That's the problem. Ours isn't working.

30:17.274 --> 30:20.277
Yeah, but that means...
Oh, dear God.

30:20.653 --> 30:24.198
- Then she knows you're here.
- Who? Who? Who is "she"?

30:31.664 --> 30:34.458
Go! Hide! Hide! All of you!

31:06.407 --> 31:08.492
Search the island. Find them.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.661
You two, with me.

31:13.914 --> 31:14.957
Look at that plane.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.209
What kind of monster flies around
in something that size?

31:17.585 --> 31:18.586
We had a deal.

31:18.919 --> 31:22.089
You promised me if I stayed on the island,
out of your way, you'd leave us alone.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.216
Drop the indignation, Doctor.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.595
This island's no-fly zone
was breached an hour ago.

31:28.971 --> 31:30.764
We both know
you're harbouring subversives.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.893
And I'll find them soon enough.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.104
What is Fitz doing with Aida?

31:39.064 --> 31:41.150
I don't know who Aida is,
but that's Madame Hydra.

31:43.861 --> 31:44.945
Subversives?

31:45.613 --> 31:47.281
They are people who happen
to be our friends.

31:47.448 --> 31:49.533
I wanted to help them.
You've turned them into prisoners!

31:50.034 --> 31:52.077
I did exactly as you asked.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.831
Don't play innocent with me, we both know
it's gone much further than that.

31:55.998 --> 31:57.917
I took away their one greatest regret.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.085
How things played out from there
wasn't up to me.

32:00.294 --> 32:03.839
You put yourself into the Framework.
You've been manipulating it ever since.

32:04.006 --> 32:05.758
The whole thing
is an unmitigated disaster,

32:05.925 --> 32:06.967
and all you do is lie!

32:07.301 --> 32:09.720
Sometimes it's okay to lie to save a life.

32:10.888 --> 32:12.514
- You taught me that.
- Don't use my words

32:12.681 --> 32:15.059
or my bloody programming against me, Aida!

32:20.898 --> 32:21.982
Do not...

32:22.691 --> 32:24.610
call me that here.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.988
"Aida" is an acronym.

32:28.781 --> 32:31.951
The "A" stands for "artificial."

32:34.954 --> 32:36.455
Do you know how degrading it is...

32:37.665 --> 32:38.874
to be kept in a closet...

32:40.167 --> 32:41.210
to be used...

32:42.795 --> 32:44.004
to be treated as a thing?

32:46.173 --> 32:47.508
Well, I am not your tool.

32:48.842 --> 32:49.927
Not anymore.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.179
Found one in the back.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.267
Holden, what's happening?
Who are these people?

33:03.607 --> 33:07.361
Sparkplug! You okay? I'm so sorry.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.322
I'm all right. Really.

33:12.533 --> 33:13.617
Skye!

33:14.326 --> 33:16.996
What happened? She was nice to me.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.837
Hydra thanks you for your service.

33:27.589 --> 33:28.716
Daddy?

33:36.682 --> 33:37.808
Hail Hydra.

33:45.399 --> 33:46.650
Well, it's exactly as you said.

33:49.111 --> 33:50.487
The other side's coming for us.

33:57.619 --> 33:59.038
She even has your face.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.377
Wh... why does she look like me, Holden?

34:05.544 --> 34:07.379
Don't panic, love.
I can explain all of this.

34:07.588 --> 34:10.257
I've meaning to,
really, but the timing just...

34:10.424 --> 34:12.259
This man is from the other side.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.344
- He's the one who enslaved me.
- What?

34:15.804 --> 34:18.181
Now, hold on.
That's a pretty extreme bit

34:18.306 --> 34:21.643
- of paraphrasing...
- He used me. Kept me as his property.

34:23.270 --> 34:26.690
Leopold, my dear boy, I don't know,
what lies she's been feeding you, but...

34:26.940 --> 34:29.150
He wants what we have for himself.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.987
- He means to replace me with her.
- No.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.157
That couldn't be further from the truth.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.327
This is Agnes.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.580
She's harmless. There's no threat.
You have to believe me.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.348
Then convince me.

35:00.307 --> 35:01.517
This isn't real, Jemma.

35:02.184 --> 35:03.894
- This world isn't real.
- He's gonna kill her.

35:04.311 --> 35:05.771
- Fitz would never do that.
- Are you sure?

35:06.438 --> 35:09.191
Get back to the Quinjet.
I'll deal with this and meet you there.

35:10.234 --> 35:11.610
Stop. We're going to need him.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.321
Need the Doctor? Are you nuts?

35:14.613 --> 35:17.533
- There's more you don't understand.
- I know everything I need to know.

35:17.866 --> 35:20.327
The man is a sadist, and I have a shot.
That's the mission now.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.620
- Listen to her.
- Please.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.123
You know, you've been lying
to me since the moment we met.

35:24.540 --> 35:26.583
A woman's life is in danger.
I'm done listening.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.546
You're right. I haven't told you
the whole story. It's...

35:31.463 --> 35:32.714
complicated, but...

35:34.508 --> 35:36.885
I know him, not as the Doctor,

35:37.010 --> 35:40.764
but as a... a brilliant, awkward,
heroic scientist

35:40.889 --> 35:44.101
named Leopold James Fitz.
He is a good man, and I love him.

35:45.394 --> 35:49.648
That woman, Madame Hydra?
She's... she's messed with his mind.

35:51.733 --> 35:52.776
If you do this...

35:53.777 --> 35:55.237
I lose him forever.

35:59.408 --> 36:03.954
I will tell you everything... everything.
I just... I need you to trust me.

36:04.705 --> 36:07.583
Fitz would never hurt
an innocent woman.

36:13.755 --> 36:16.216
You're... you're right.
The subversives are here.

36:16.383 --> 36:19.219
I see now,
I should've been more forthcoming.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.805
Please, put the gun down.
I'll... I'll take you to them.

36:22.306 --> 36:25.225
Tell me the truth.
You act like you know me.

36:26.143 --> 36:27.186
Why?

36:27.978 --> 36:30.439
The soldiers can find the subversives.
We should be going.

36:30.606 --> 36:31.899
You were like a son to me.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.359
We worked side by side in the lab,

36:34.526 --> 36:36.069
on occasion, we'd raise a pint...

36:36.195 --> 36:39.239
or six,
watching football, real football.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.159
- That's absurd.
- It's the truth, my boy.

36:42.451 --> 36:44.077
- You even helped me build Aida.
- Enough!

36:45.704 --> 36:48.040
- We're done here.
- Then why don't I remember you?

36:48.415 --> 36:50.792
Because it all happened
in the other world.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.378
It wasn't you, Fitz.
It was their world's version of you.

36:53.795 --> 36:54.796
And the woman?

36:55.964 --> 36:57.758
- Jemma Simmons?
- Simmons?

36:58.091 --> 36:59.218
You two were in love.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.011
Unbreakable.

37:02.054 --> 37:03.555
A force to be reckoned with.

37:03.764 --> 37:05.557
The Fitz I knew nearly drowned for Jemma.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.935
He crossed the bloody universe
to rescue her!

37:08.352 --> 37:09.645
You see what we're up against?

37:10.437 --> 37:11.688
They mean to destroy us.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.483
She lies because I'm right.
She's trying to deceive you.

37:14.691 --> 37:17.444
I love you. They're trying
to take you away from me.

37:17.861 --> 37:20.739
The world has changed,
but you're not this man.

37:21.490 --> 37:23.909
You're one of the good guys.
You help people. Look inside.

37:24.326 --> 37:25.744
This isn't you.

37:34.795 --> 37:36.255
You say that I'm not myself.

37:37.798 --> 37:38.840
I don't know who I am.

37:39.633 --> 37:41.093
It isn't your fault, any of it.

37:44.304 --> 37:45.430
But you're wrong.

37:50.811 --> 37:51.979
I know exactly who I am.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.362
Fitz!

38:00.570 --> 38:02.489
No!

38:23.135 --> 38:24.261
Get back!

38:30.350 --> 38:31.518
Go! Now!

38:44.489 --> 38:45.574
Hang on to something!

39:06.136 --> 39:07.137
How about that?

39:11.892 --> 39:13.352
There was nothing else you could've done.

39:14.728 --> 39:15.937
He killed Agnes.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.066
Fitz killed her.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.402
I'm sorry.

39:27.074 --> 39:30.202
Someone had better explain what
the hell happened out there, pronto!

39:30.452 --> 39:33.163
Ward tells me he had a shot on the Doctor
but you stopped him.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.540
And that you're in love
with that psychopath!

39:35.707 --> 39:36.708
We can explain everything.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.502
She says Madame Hydra
brainwashed him.

39:38.710 --> 39:39.920
That's a bold claim.

39:40.295 --> 39:43.256
You have evidence, or do we have to take
this at face value, too?

39:43.465 --> 39:45.634
- She's been through a lot.
- We all have. Step aside.

39:46.259 --> 39:47.969
- This can wait.
- No, she owes us answers.

39:48.220 --> 39:51.890
This is wrong. We don't even belong here!
None of this is real!

39:58.063 --> 40:00.440
Please! She just needs some time.

40:00.899 --> 40:01.983
Sir.

40:02.192 --> 40:04.986
A recon team found a civilian
sniffing around one of our dead drops.

40:05.278 --> 40:06.405
He's got quite the story.

40:06.988 --> 40:09.449
Well, I'm glad somebody
wants to talk.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.867
Let's hear it.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.579
I met a woman today
who was with S.H.I.E.L.D.

40:15.872 --> 40:19.418
Her name is Daisy Johnson.
You might know her as Skye?

40:21.586 --> 40:23.130
Hydra used me to...

40:26.091 --> 40:28.593
- trick her and take her captive.
- No.

40:31.430 --> 40:32.681
Please tell me she's okay.

40:35.434 --> 40:36.726
Why are you here?

40:37.811 --> 40:40.397
Today, for the first time,
I couldn't look my little girl in the eye.

40:41.690 --> 40:42.858
I need to make that right.

40:45.986 --> 40:47.237
I'm here to help.

40:56.329 --> 40:59.916
I take it all back! I'm sorry!
I can beg! I'm good at begging!

41:00.917 --> 41:02.544
Just tell me what to say! Please!

41:11.219 --> 41:12.262
Fitz.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.807
Hear me out. You and me...

41:17.726 --> 41:20.270
...we know each other. We're friends.

41:21.188 --> 41:23.565
I can explain all of this.

41:24.399 --> 41:25.609
How curious.

41:27.277 --> 41:28.361
Someone else tried that today.

41:29.613 --> 41:31.781
Maybe you heard him just now,
learning his lesson.

41:37.454 --> 41:40.457
So, I re-ran your test results.

41:41.833 --> 41:45.170
Guess who turned out to be
a potential Inhuman.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.300
Go on.

41:51.343 --> 41:52.344
Guess.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.181
Oh, well. No matter.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.642
We've got plenty of ways
of making you talk.

42:00.852 --> 42:01.853
Fitz.

42:02.521 --> 42:03.647
No, Fitz.

42:05.398 --> 42:06.566
You don't want to do this.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.404
Yeah, I do.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.157
No.

42:17.744 --> 42:19.204
I guess you don't know me at all.
