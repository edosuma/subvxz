PLEASE TELL ME
THIS ISN'T MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.454
NO, NO.

10:05.439 --> 10:08.773
NO.
I'M JUST SO NOT FEELING THIS.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.775
HEY, LIV.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.011
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.380
SO TODD STETSON
AND HIS JERK-TOURAGE

10:15.382 --> 10:18.116
ARE RATING ALL OF THE GIRLS
AT SCHOOL BASED
ON THEIR LOOKS.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.218
WHAT?
THAT'S SO HORRIBLE.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.803
YEAH.

10:21.804 --> 10:23.387
WELL, WHO CAME UP
WITH JERK-TOURAGE
BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY GOOD?

10:25.826 --> 10:28.960
I'M A SIX, MADDIE'S A SEVEN,
YOU GOT AN EIGHT,
WILLOW AND LACEY ARE FIVES.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.863
I'M SO DISGUSTED.
I HAVEN'T EVEN CALCULATED
OUR AVERAGE SCORE.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.165
AND WE ARE NOT
GOING TO STAND FOR IT.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.835
RIGHT!

10:39.473 --> 10:41.006
IS THIS NOT
WHAT YOU MEANT?

10:42.309 --> 10:45.877
( scoffs )
THAT IS SO
COMPLETELY OUTRAGEOUS.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.179
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T JUST GO AROUND
RATING GIRLS LIKE WE'RE OBJECTS.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.148
I FEEL LIKE EVERYWHERE
I TURN THESE DAYS,

10:50.150 --> 10:52.050
SOMEONE'S TELLING GIRLS
WHO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.119
YEAH, ANYTIME
I PICK UP A MAGAZINE

10:54.121 --> 10:56.287
I FEEL LIKE I'M NO GOOD
IF I DON'T LOOK
LIKE THOSE GIRLS.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.324
AND I DON'T LOOK
LIKE THOSE GIRLS.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.259
SINCE I WAS LITTLE,
BOYS WOULD TEASE ME

11:01.261 --> 11:03.228
FOR LIKING SCIENCE
INSTEAD OF GIRL STUFF,

11:03.230 --> 11:05.096
BUT SCIENCE IS GIRL STUFF.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.198
I MEAN, WHAT GIRL DOESN'T LIKE
A GOOD BUNSEN BURNER.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.503
YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE?
WHEN SOME GUY COMES UP TO ME
AND IS LIKE,

11:11.505 --> 11:13.938
HEY, YOU'RE REALLY GOOD
AT BASKETBALL...

11:13.940 --> 11:15.607
YOU KNOW,
FOR A GIRL.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.909
LIKE, WHAT?
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
SOME KIND OF COMPLIMENT?

11:17.911 --> 11:19.044
<i>( laughs )</i>

11:19.046 --> 11:21.079
WE HAVE TO GET BACK
AT TODD STETSON.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.581
YOU KNOW WHAT, MADDIE?
YOU'RE RIGHT,

11:23.583 --> 11:26.084
AND WE CAN TAKE
HIS RATING SYSTEM DOWN.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.353
I MEAN, IT ONLY HAS POWER
IF WE BUY INTO IT, RIGHT?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.521
All: YEAH!

11:29.523 --> 11:31.156
I JUST WISH THIS CHAIR
HAD ARMS.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.091
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
TO PUT MY ELBOWS.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.162
LACEY, DO I HAVE
A SONG FOR YOU.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.203
OH, YOU'RE UP.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.206
I WAS GOING TO BRING YOU
BREAKFAST IN BED, BIRTHDAY BOY.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.875
I WANT MY NEGATIVE FIVE THINGS.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.079
OH!

11:54.081 --> 11:56.265
JOEY, YOU TOO?

11:56.266 --> 11:58.450
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO
FOR MY DEAR OLD POPS
ON HIS BIRTHDAY.

11:58.452 --> 11:59.517
( laughs )

11:59.519 --> 12:01.352
( whispers )
I DIDN'T GET HIM ANYTHING.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.522
FINE, THIS IS YOUR DAY.

12:05.459 --> 12:06.925
I CAN DO THIS.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.627
NOT THE ARTICHOKE
CANDLE HOLDER!

12:10.597 --> 12:12.781
NO, I GAVE THAT TO PARKER

12:12.782 --> 12:14.966
THE DAY HE AGREED TO TRY
ARTICHOKES FOR THE FIRST TIME.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.267
MY LITTLE 'CHOKE EATER.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.537
ONE DOWN,
FOUR TO GO.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.273
BEST... BIRTHDAY... EVER.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.376
IT'S LIKE I CAN STILL
FEEL IT'S THERE.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.180
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THIS IS,

12:29.182 --> 12:30.949
BUT I KNOW
I HATE IT.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.118
THE OVERALLS ARE
A SYMBOL OF OUR CHILDREN,

12:33.120 --> 12:34.452
WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG
AND NEEDED US,

12:34.454 --> 12:37.055
BUT THEY'RE EMPTY NOW
BECAUSE THEY'RE GROWN.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.090
OH, WE MUST NEVER FORGET.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.993
MOM, YOU JUST MADE THAT UP.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.229
ALL RIGHT, I FOUND IT
IN THE STREET, BUT I LOVE THEM!

12:46.099 --> 12:47.232
AND HOW ABOUT
THE MINI CHAIRS?

12:49.236 --> 12:50.235
WHICH ONE SHOULD I
GET RID OF?

12:50.237 --> 12:52.170
WHAT?

12:52.171 --> 12:54.104
THAT'S LIKE ASKING ME TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN MY BABIES, PETE.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.974
IF THAT'S AN OPTION,
TAKE JOEY.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.544
I KNOW THAT IS
NOT YOU TALKING.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.312
IT IS YOUR SICKNESS.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.715
PICK A CHAIR, JOE.

13:03.717 --> 13:05.250
MATTER OF FACT,
PICK TWO.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.052
THE CHAIRS ARE
SMALL IN SIZE,

13:08.054 --> 13:10.155
BUT THEY'RE HUGE
IN MEANING, PETE!

13:11.324 --> 13:12.957
ALL RIGHT,
I THINK I'LL CHOOSE

13:12.959 --> 13:14.626
UGLY AND STUPID.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.664
AND I SAVED JUST ENOUGH ROOM
IN THE BOX FOR YOU, MY FRIEND.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.335
SOMEDAY YOU'RE
GOING TO NEED BRANZINO.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.173
AND HE WAS NEVER
YOUR FRIEND.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.580
SORRY, DUDE.
IF YOUR SISTER'S A FOUR,
SHE'S A FOUR.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.249
TELL HER TO SMILE LESS
UNTIL THE BRACES COME OFF.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.517
( guys laughing )

13:44.658 --> 13:46.157
HEY.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.093
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS, TODD STETSON?

13:49.095 --> 13:50.161
WHOA.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.529
I'D CALL THIS A HOT MESS,

13:51.531 --> 13:53.431
BUT THERE'S NOTHING HOT
ABOUT THIS AT ALL.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.034
( laughs )
UP TOP!

13:56.036 --> 13:57.602
THIS IS JUST A STATEMENT

13:57.604 --> 14:00.371
FROM EVERY GIRL IN THE SCHOOL
TO YOU AND YOUR JERK-TOURAGE.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.208
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT
YOUR STUPID RATING SYSTEM.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.375
WE ARE ALL TENS,

14:04.377 --> 14:06.177
BUT IF YOU CAN'T SEE THAT...

14:06.179 --> 14:07.212
WE'LL ALL BE ONES.

14:07.214 --> 14:10.248
YEAH, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
TRYING TO SEND ME A MESSAGE.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.483
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
TWO POINTS OFF FOR THAT, LADIES.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.288
ALL RIGHT, WELL, NONE OF US CARE
WHAT STUPID NUMBER YOU GIVE US.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.190
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

14:24.064 --> 14:25.396
WELL, OUR WORK HERE
IS DONE.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.232
LATER, LADIES.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.601
WILLOW,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.637
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
WEAR DRESSES?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.072
AND HIGH HEELS.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.440
YEAH, AND DID YOU...

14:35.442 --> 14:37.141
GO OUT AND BUY
A CURLING IRON?

14:39.045 --> 14:40.562
SORRY.

14:40.563 --> 14:42.080
I KNOW WE ALL AGREED
TO WEAR GARBAGE BAGS TODAY,

14:42.082 --> 14:44.249
BUT I JUST COULDN'T.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.684
I WANT GUYS TO LIKE ME.

14:47.787 --> 14:50.355
I DON'T WANT A FIVE.
WILLOW WANTS A SEVEN.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.490
OKAY, BUT, WILLOW,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.793
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IN
TO TODD'S AWFUL RATING SYSTEM.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.462
YOU'RE ALREADY SO AMAZING.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.298
GUYS...

15:00.300 --> 15:02.500
THIS IS THE WORLD
THAT WE LIVE IN.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.668
I--

15:03.670 --> 15:05.336
WILLOW, WAIT.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.177
OKAY.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.447
SO, WILLOW'S RIGHT.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.781
THIS IS THE WORLD
THAT WE LIVE IN,

15:16.783 --> 15:18.816
BUT WHY CAN'T WE
CHANGE THE WORLD?

15:20.854 --> 15:23.121
CHANGING THE WORLD
SEEMS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.407
IT DOES SEEM
LIKE A LOT OF WORK.

15:26.408 --> 15:28.558
I DON'T EVEN LIKE
CHANGING THE CEDAR CHIPS
IN MY HAMSTER'S CAGE.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.540
( slurping )

15:44.277 --> 15:46.744
( slurping amplified )

15:49.716 --> 15:52.617
( slurping continues )

15:54.120 --> 15:55.386
DO YOU MIND?

15:55.388 --> 15:57.722
I AM TRYING TO QUIETLY ENJOY

15:57.724 --> 16:00.558
MY INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED
SLICES OF SKY CHEESE.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.662
SORRY, BRO.
IT'S A SLURP OF JOY.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.699
LIFE'S PRETTY SWEET DOWN HERE
ON THE GOLDEN SHORES

16:07.701 --> 16:09.300
OF PARKLANDIA.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.904
YOU ARE
AN EARTH-BOUND TROLL.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.605
YOU'RE NEVER COMING DOWN.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.342
WELL, I'VE GOT ENOUGH SKY CHEESE
AND CHOCOLATE MILK UP HERE

16:17.344 --> 16:18.609
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.445

16:21.414 --> 16:22.580

<i>GUYS!</i>

16:22.582 --> 16:24.182

16:24.184 --> 16:25.383

( sighs )

16:32.225 --> 16:33.825
FATHER...

16:33.827 --> 16:36.494
THE NATIONS OF
PARKLANDIA AND SKY CITY

16:36.496 --> 16:37.628
ARE AT WAR.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.198
HIS PEOPLE
CAN'T BE REASONED WITH.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.899
THEY ARE BARBARIANS.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.403
WELL, I'D RATHER BE
A BARBARIAN

16:45.405 --> 16:47.672
THAN A CEILING MONKEY.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.942
GUYS, STOP THIS.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.411
LOOK, I KNOW IT CAN
BE TOUGH SHARING A ROOM,

16:53.413 --> 16:56.914
BUT WHEN YOU'RE GROWN UP,
YOU'RE GOING TO MISS EACH OTHER.

16:56.916 --> 16:59.717
YOU'RE GONNA WISH YOU HADN'T
SPENT SO MUCH TIME FIGHTING.

16:59.719 --> 17:00.818
THANKS, DAD.

17:00.820 --> 17:05.189
YOU KNOW, I LOOK FORWARD
TO THE DAY WHEN WE'RE GROWN UP
AND MATURE.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.924
BUT UNTIL THEN...

17:06.926 --> 17:09.961
PARKLANDIA WILL
FEEL MY WRATH

17:09.963 --> 17:12.296
AND TASTE MY CHEESE!

17:13.433 --> 17:15.900
( grunting )

17:17.937 --> 17:20.805
OH, DO YOU LIKE CHEESE?

17:20.807 --> 17:23.274
THEN HOW ABOUT
SOME CHEESE PUFFS?

17:32.852 --> 17:35.920
PARKLANDIA
CROUCHES FOR NO ONE!

17:40.260 --> 17:41.893
- ( typing )

have been rating us girls

20:06.673 --> 20:08.039
<i>based on our looks,</i>

20:08.041 --> 20:10.942
and that makes us girls
feel like we have to change.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.111
But you don't have to change
who you are

20:14.113 --> 20:15.646
to fit someone else's idea

20:15.648 --> 20:17.415
