Boy, this Chinese food is terrible.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.875
Well, what'd you expect from a place
called "The Scabby Dragon"?

00:13.583 --> 00:16.166
I'll take one of these fortune cookies.
Hard to mess them up.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.834
"You are about to embark
on an exciting journey."

00:21.166 --> 00:23.166
Oh, sweet, dude. That's a good one.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.875
These fortunes are just a dumb gimmick

00:25.000 --> 00:28.458
to take your mind off how the cookies look
and taste like an old man's ear.

00:29.875 --> 00:31.542
I can't tell you how I know this,

00:31.625 --> 00:34.041
But they taste nothing
like an old man's ear.

00:37.667 --> 00:38.625
Uh.

00:39.542 --> 00:41.792
"A surprise will fall from the sky."

00:42.500 --> 00:44.583
"Your carelessness will harm a friend."

00:45.041 --> 00:47.333
"You have a nose for trou--"

00:47.917 --> 00:50.000
- Sound it out.
- "trouble."

00:54.166 --> 00:57.750
Aw, check out that squirrel up there,
cute little fellow, y--

00:57.834 --> 00:59.875
- Aah! Get it off!
- Dude, chill--

00:59.959 --> 01:01.125
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:01.667 --> 01:03.750
- Dude!
- Wait a minute.

01:05.041 --> 01:07.166
"A surprise will fall from the sky."

01:08.667 --> 01:10.250
I will harm a friend.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.542
And my nose is definitely in trouble.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.792
Guys, you're not gonna believe this!

01:15.875 --> 01:18.125
Jack just found out he's going to China!

01:19.166 --> 01:21.375
- The journey.
- The cookies.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.709
I cannot believe this.

02:06.792 --> 02:11.125
I am going to the Junior World
Martial Arts Championships in China!

02:11.208 --> 02:14.500
I was gonna go,
but I'm not what they call, you know,

02:15.208 --> 02:16.166
good.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.875
Guys, I've been dreaming
about this tournament

02:19.959 --> 02:21.375
since I got in the martial arts.

02:21.875 --> 02:22.834
How did this happen?

02:23.041 --> 02:25.875
Mm, I may know how it happened.

02:26.458 --> 02:31.291
I might have taken it upon myself
to write a letter about a certain student,

02:31.375 --> 02:36.083
and possibly sent it to,
oh, I don't know, China.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.667
Dude, this is important. Try to remember.
Did you do it or not?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.500
Of course I did it.

02:42.834 --> 02:47.458
Jack's amazing. He's undefeated.
He's never lost a match in his life.

02:48.208 --> 02:49.083
Rudy,

02:50.750 --> 02:52.375
can I talk to you outside for a second?

02:54.959 --> 02:58.333
Guys, this fortune cookie thing
is freaking me out.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.375
Every one of them came true.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.166
It's scientifically impossible

03:03.250 --> 03:06.125
for a piece of paper in a random pastry
to predict the future.

03:06.750 --> 03:07.583
There's one left.

03:07.667 --> 03:10.333
- That magic cookie is mine.
- No, I had it first!

03:10.417 --> 03:11.417
- No!
- I got it.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.750
-
- Dude!

03:12.834 --> 03:13.709
- You're--
- What?

03:13.792 --> 03:15.125
You're eating the fortune!

03:15.542 --> 03:16.375
Oh.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.041
Here.

03:21.583 --> 03:24.333
- "You will find a great treasure in--"
- In what?

03:25.250 --> 03:28.458
In Jerry's stomach,
because that's where the rest of this is.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.875
- Way to go, Jerry!
- Wait,

03:31.291 --> 03:33.583
I can get it out.
I did this when I swallowed my retainer.

03:39.959 --> 03:40.959
Forget it!

03:42.583 --> 03:46.000
Rudy, not everything you told
those people about me was true.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.500
Please, everybody stretches the truth.

03:48.583 --> 03:51.250
I do it all the time
on my online dating profile.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.834
I'm not really a bathing suit model.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.917
Rudy, I'm not undefeated.

03:57.125 --> 04:01.041
A kid named Kai beat me so badly,
I gave up karate till I came here.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.417
Jack, it doesn't matter. You deserve this.

04:04.917 --> 04:08.709
And that's why they sent you
two first-class tickets to China.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.250
You get to bring someone--

04:10.583 --> 04:14.500
An adult, a mentor, perhaps someone
who is both here and a man.

04:15.709 --> 04:17.250
It'd be great if we could all go.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.375
Wait, first-class tickets
are really expensive,

04:21.208 --> 04:23.542
maybe I could trade them
in for six coach tickets.

04:23.625 --> 04:27.709
It's settled. Jack and I
are going alone, first-class--

04:28.709 --> 04:31.625
Endless legroom,
our own entertainment systems

04:32.000 --> 04:33.458
and hot nuts.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.542
I'm just saying,
it'd be great if we could all--

04:36.625 --> 04:37.750
I said hot nuts, Kim!

04:39.667 --> 04:42.625
Guys, we're all going to China!

04:58.375 --> 05:00.250
All right, this is amazing!

05:00.333 --> 05:03.959
We are actually standing
on the great wall of China.

05:04.041 --> 05:08.542
Just think, thousands of years ago
the emperor could've stood right here,

05:08.625 --> 05:10.709
leaned out over the edge of the wall
and yelled,

05:10.792 --> 05:12.917
"You darn kids
aren't getting your ball back!"

05:14.542 --> 05:17.875
This thing is over 3700 miles long.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.542
The biggest landmark back in Seaford
is the water tower

05:20.625 --> 05:22.542
somebody spray-painted "Fart" on.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.583
Well, this wall is awesome,

05:25.834 --> 05:27.583
but you know what else is awesome?

05:27.667 --> 05:29.834
- Cookies with fortunes that come true.
- Yeah.

05:29.917 --> 05:32.041
So we're gonna head over
to the Panda Moon Cookie Company.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.041
It turns out it's just a few miles
from here.

05:34.458 --> 05:36.458
Once we get the other half
of that fortune,

05:36.542 --> 05:38.458
we'll be able to find
where our treasure is.

05:38.542 --> 05:41.709
Guys, Jack's tournament starts
in a couple of hours. Don't get lost.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.208
Don't worry, we won't be late.

05:43.625 --> 05:45.375
I found a great cab driver.

05:45.458 --> 05:49.500
Why old lady sitting in car eating cake?

05:49.583 --> 05:52.709
Drive, lady! Eat faster!

05:52.792 --> 05:55.291
Oh, great, now stupid yak!

05:55.375 --> 05:59.166
He blocked whole street!
Move your butt, hairy beast!

05:59.500 --> 06:02.041
- Hi-yah!
- This guy's gonna get us killed.

06:02.125 --> 06:06.000
Yaks don't get angry, Jerry.
They're very calm, docile creature--

06:06.750 --> 06:08.667
Ah, yeah, he-- No, he's angry.

06:11.333 --> 06:13.625
Get down, get down, get down.

06:13.709 --> 06:15.750
Yak attack. Get down.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.166
Move out of the way, beast.

06:18.250 --> 06:20.583
Ugh, did you see that?

06:20.667 --> 06:23.667
Did I see that?
A yak just tried getting in our car!

06:24.333 --> 06:25.834
But we're all good now.

06:27.834 --> 06:30.166
Oh, it's fiancee's ex-boyfriend Zack.

06:30.250 --> 06:33.250
- Get down! Zack attack!
- What?

06:33.750 --> 06:37.375
Both Zack and yak attacks
will be reflected in your tip.

06:40.125 --> 06:43.417
Who's the man? You're the man! Say it!

06:43.959 --> 06:45.875
- You're the man.
- Right!

06:46.417 --> 06:49.125
No, no, no, I'm not the man.
You're the man.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.917
I'm just a man.
Just a man in a world of men

06:53.000 --> 06:54.083
- and some women--
- Hey, Jack.

06:54.166 --> 06:57.250
Jack, I was down at the market
and I picked you up these Baoding stones.

06:57.709 --> 06:58.583
Oh,

06:59.291 --> 07:01.667
kind of had my heart set
on a glow-in-the-dark ninja bobblehead,

07:01.750 --> 07:03.458
but no, no, rocks are cool.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.166
By rotating them in your hand,

07:06.250 --> 07:09.000
it will center you, build your chi
and help you compete.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.750
Hey, can I see those for a second?

07:13.166 --> 07:14.625
What is wrong with you?

07:14.709 --> 07:18.125
Why don't you hop on your unicorn
and ride to yoga class, moon princess?

07:19.583 --> 07:21.375
We don't need your magic rocks.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.625
Right, right.

07:24.875 --> 07:27.959
He needs you telling him,
"The pain train is on the Jack track!"

07:28.250 --> 07:29.834
What does that even mean?

07:29.917 --> 07:32.709
Ah, it means that Jack needs
to come out swinging

07:32.792 --> 07:35.709
- and show them that this is his house!
-

07:40.458 --> 07:44.166
Do you realize you just broke
a thousand-year-old table?

07:44.458 --> 07:46.166
You've had that table
for a thousand years?

07:47.250 --> 07:48.625
You people ever hear of a garage sale?

07:55.250 --> 07:57.458
-
- Why'd you stop?

07:57.875 --> 08:02.125
Hard to drive and cry at the same time.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.250
Tonight's my wedding night
and I don't know what to do.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.333
I don't know what to do either, man.
I'm only 13.

08:11.208 --> 08:14.875
I just got a text from the guys
in my wedding party.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.625
They can't make it.

08:17.709 --> 08:19.917
And without three men to stand with me,

08:20.834 --> 08:22.917
I can't get married!

08:24.291 --> 08:26.250
Guys, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

08:26.709 --> 08:28.583
-
- Yeah.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.000
- Let's find another cab.
- Yeah.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.625
Oh, please come stand with me.

08:33.166 --> 08:34.792
I love this girl.

08:35.834 --> 08:37.542
- I don't know.
-

08:37.625 --> 08:39.750
Uh, we've gotta get to the cookie factory

08:39.834 --> 08:41.709
and then we've gotta get back
to Jack's tournament.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.875
This will be quick. I promise.

08:43.959 --> 08:47.959
All we need to do is get you dressed
in traditional Chinese clothes.

08:49.959 --> 08:51.583
I haven't worn this much makeup

08:51.667 --> 08:54.667
since I starred as Cleopatra
in the school play.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.583
- Why were you cle--
- Because I had the legs for it.

09:00.417 --> 09:03.208
I still don't get how Elvis is part
of a Chinese wedding.

09:03.291 --> 09:05.917
He's not. It was the only costume left.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.792
It was either that or Santa Claus.

09:09.041 --> 09:11.542
Shen, just glad we could help you out.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.000
Congratulations.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.333
Congratulations to you guys too.

09:15.417 --> 09:17.750
Wait. Why?

09:18.834 --> 09:22.333
I couldn't marry my wife
unless I found husbands for her sisters.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.834
So congratulations, bro-in-laws.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.709
- Ha?
- Huh?

09:40.709 --> 09:43.834
Hey, can we wait, like, five minutes?
I'm sure my friends will be--

09:46.875 --> 09:48.417
Or we can just go now.

09:57.125 --> 09:58.667
- <i>Yame.</i>
Yeah!

10:06.166 --> 10:07.709
- <i>Yame.</i>
-

10:18.917 --> 10:22.208
Let me guess,
priceless thousand-year-old vase.

10:23.417 --> 10:25.041
Just put it on my tab.

10:36.542 --> 10:38.166
- <i>Yame.</i>
- Yes!

10:40.792 --> 10:42.208
Yes! Yes!

10:43.750 --> 10:45.875
- Jack, you did it! You're in the final!
-

10:46.208 --> 10:47.625
Now as your sensei,

10:47.709 --> 10:50.792
I know you look at me as the guy
that is responsible for your success,

10:50.875 --> 10:53.208
but I want you to know
that in some small way...

10:53.709 --> 10:55.083
you're a part of it too.

10:56.166 --> 10:57.083
Thanks, Rudy.

10:57.667 --> 10:59.667
-
- Hiya!

11:01.667 --> 11:03.750
- Ugh! Get up, punk!
- <i>Yame.</i>

11:03.834 --> 11:05.709
Looks like the other semi-final is over.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.917
That's your opponent in the championship.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.375
That's Kai.

11:10.792 --> 11:12.625
I saw your fights, Jack.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.375
Surprised to see you here.

11:14.750 --> 11:17.208
I thought I'd swing by
and pick up a trophy or two.

11:17.375 --> 11:18.792
That's funny.

11:18.875 --> 11:21.500
I thought I beat the Karate out of you
two years ago.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.458
Well, I'm a better fighter
than I was two years ago.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.542
And your breath is worse.

11:27.834 --> 11:30.500
Listen, loser,
this time when I take you down,

11:30.583 --> 11:32.208
you're not getting back up.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.458
Pfft! He's not afraid of you, Kai!

11:38.375 --> 11:39.375
Right, Jack?

11:39.709 --> 11:41.667
Kim, I can't beat this guy.

11:43.208 --> 11:46.166
Jack, think about everything
that I taught you.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.542
Think about everything
your grandfather taught you.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.250
He was a master sensei.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.375
He taught the same things to Kai.

11:54.458 --> 11:55.583
Kai's my cousin.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.500
You really need to get
some stronger furniture in here!

12:09.500 --> 12:11.000
What happened between you and Kai?

12:12.166 --> 12:13.875
We both studied with our grandfather,

12:14.208 --> 12:17.041
but to Kai it wasn't about honor
and discipline.

12:17.125 --> 12:19.458
It was about intimidation
and hurting people.

12:19.542 --> 12:20.917
Jack, it doesn't matter.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.375
You can take him.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.542
Yeah, you are not gonna give up
on yourself,

12:25.000 --> 12:26.875
not after I flew
all the way out here in coach,

12:26.959 --> 12:28.417
stuck between a screaming baby

12:28.500 --> 12:30.333
and a man who cleaned himself
with his tongue.

12:31.875 --> 12:32.959
Maybe you guys are right.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.917
My grandfather taught me
to live by the Wasabi code.

12:36.417 --> 12:38.542
We swear by the light of the dragon's eye

12:38.625 --> 12:41.583
to be loyal and honest and never say die.

12:41.959 --> 12:43.417
Never say die, Jack.

12:44.417 --> 12:46.000
I don't know if I can beat Kai,

12:46.583 --> 12:48.125
but he's gonna know he's been in a fight.

12:48.709 --> 12:50.333
Why didn't you tell us
Kai was your cousin?

12:50.625 --> 12:53.083
My family were really embarrassed of Kai.

12:53.166 --> 12:56.375
And my Uncle Carl wears flip-flops
to the post office.

12:57.041 --> 13:00.000
- That's not so weird.
- It is if that's all he wears.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.417
You do not wanna know
where he keeps his stamps.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.208
<i>Ándale! Ándale! Ándale!</i>

13:08.458 --> 13:10.709
<i>Arriba! Arriba!</i>

13:17.041 --> 13:18.875
Man, 2,000 years old

13:18.959 --> 13:21.625
and that toilet still flushes better
than the one at the dojo.

13:26.917 --> 13:27.834
What?

13:52.875 --> 13:53.959
Come on!

13:59.959 --> 14:01.959
Oh, Kai.

14:02.125 --> 14:04.041
- Thanks, man.
- Who were those guys?

14:04.125 --> 14:07.125
I don't know. I kind of feel like a jerk.
I thought you were one of them.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.458
Come on, Jack, we're still cousins.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.041
Who'd jump me like this?

14:11.375 --> 14:13.959
You just beat four of the best fighters
in the world.

14:14.041 --> 14:15.375
Some of them don't like to lose.

14:15.792 --> 14:16.875
- Yeah.
- You're all right?

14:17.166 --> 14:21.208
I don't know. My hand really hurts.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.709
- Do you think we lost them?
- For now.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.208
- This is all your fault.
- Huh?

14:34.291 --> 14:36.083
You're the one that said
we needed to help Shen.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.166
Well, excuse me for having a heart.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.375
Yeah? Well, because of your heart,
we're lost, broke

14:40.458 --> 14:41.875
and you two are dressed like idiots.

14:41.959 --> 14:43.375
- Oh, I'm dressed like an idiot?
- Yeah!

14:43.458 --> 14:45.709
- Have you seen yourself in the mirror?
- Guys. Guys.

14:45.792 --> 14:47.041
Guys!

14:47.333 --> 14:48.709
Check it out.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.250
It's the Panda Moon Cookie Company.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.750
Whoa!

14:57.750 --> 15:01.125
Jack, after a thorough examination
of your hand...

15:05.417 --> 15:07.250
I'm afraid I have to be honest with you.

15:11.709 --> 15:14.709
- Based on my diagnosis...
-

15:14.792 --> 15:15.667
Rudy!

15:16.250 --> 15:19.709
Jack, your hand is broken.
You can't fight in the tournament tonight.

15:20.166 --> 15:22.750
What? No, no! No, I didn't come
all the way out here to forfeit.

15:23.417 --> 15:24.375
I'm sorry.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.542
I know things didn't turn out
the way you wanted,

15:31.625 --> 15:34.375
but you proved you belonged here.

15:34.917 --> 15:38.125
Right here with the best in the world.

15:40.208 --> 15:41.417
I'm really proud of you.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.875
Now I'm just gonna walk
behind those lockers

15:46.000 --> 15:49.250
and if you hear what sounds
like a grown man crying...

15:50.917 --> 15:52.917
it's probably just the pipes.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.375
Stupid pipes.

16:08.625 --> 16:09.917
- Hey!
Ha!

16:10.917 --> 16:12.834
We're closed. What do you want?

16:12.959 --> 16:17.166
We've come all the way from America
just to see you, Pei Pei.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.208
Hey, what is this?

16:19.917 --> 16:21.208
Am I getting the "Punk'd"?

16:22.917 --> 16:25.000
We need to know the rest of this fortune.

16:25.834 --> 16:28.250
"You will find the greatest treasure
of all in--"

16:29.125 --> 16:33.166
Oh, this riddle is impossible to solve.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.458
It would be easier to knock down the moon
with a stick

16:36.542 --> 16:40.083
or ride a dragon with--
Oh, wait, 4-18. I know this one.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.375
- You wanna know this?
Yeah, we do.

16:45.792 --> 16:46.709
Yeah.

16:47.542 --> 16:49.125
Ah, aah!

16:50.458 --> 16:53.625
"You will find the greatest treasure of
all in..."

16:53.709 --> 16:56.000
4-16, 4-17.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.000
Ah! "your friends."

16:58.083 --> 17:00.458
Yay! Oh, what?

17:00.542 --> 17:02.250
Did you just say your friends?

17:02.333 --> 17:04.291
I don't know what you're trying
to pull here,

17:04.375 --> 17:07.625
but we're not leaving until we know
where our treasure is, grandma!

17:12.083 --> 17:14.083
- Hiya!

17:22.291 --> 17:23.834
I just got a text from the guys.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.375
They said they're sorry I had to forfeit.

17:25.458 --> 17:28.250
And they'll be here
as soon as they ditch the wives.

17:29.208 --> 17:30.208
What does that mean?

17:30.875 --> 17:33.750
Uh, try to stay hip to the jive, Kim.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.250
"Ditch the wives"
is what the kids today say

17:36.333 --> 17:37.959
when something is cool or rad.

17:40.458 --> 17:43.917
Hey, Jack, check out that judge's beard.
It's so ditch the wives.

17:45.917 --> 17:50.166
And now this year's Junior World
Martial Arts Champion...

17:50.709 --> 17:51.667
Kai.

17:51.750 --> 17:53.250
Would you please come up here?

17:59.834 --> 18:01.333
I'm gonna go congratulate Kai.

18:09.375 --> 18:10.667
Congratulations, Kai.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.500
- This guy a friend of yours?
- Yeah. Why?

18:13.583 --> 18:16.375
Well, 'cause he's got the same tattoo
as one of the guys that jumped me!

18:17.125 --> 18:21.250
Jack, you had a forfeit. I won. Let it go.

18:21.375 --> 18:24.166
You won because you were afraid
to fight me.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.125
So you sent your friends to take me out.

18:26.208 --> 18:29.959
You better watch your mouth.
You're still just a little punk.

18:30.583 --> 18:33.667
And you're still a liar, a cheat,
and a coward.

18:35.417 --> 18:37.000
But enjoy your trophy, champ.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.625
That is so not ditch the wives!

18:46.041 --> 18:47.125
Back up!

19:38.792 --> 19:40.583
Okay, Jack, I'm sorry.

19:41.917 --> 19:44.000
I'll admit it.
I planned the attack against you.

19:45.125 --> 19:48.041
- Just don't let me fall.
- Don't worry. I've got you, man.

19:48.125 --> 19:50.208
Come on. Get up.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.208
Come on-- Over.

19:59.667 --> 20:02.458
That proves you're weak.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.208
I would've let you drop.

20:14.959 --> 20:18.667
Okay. I think everybody saw
I was nowhere near that bench.

20:21.125 --> 20:23.166
See you next year, champ.

20:25.542 --> 20:29.250
Sorry we're late. You would not believe
what we've been through.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.667
Ooh, it's the wife.

20:35.125 --> 20:36.166
-
- Ignore!

20:40.917 --> 20:44.417
So after all got you find out
your great treasure is in your friends.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.333
Yeah! Can you believe that?

20:46.583 --> 20:49.291
I can. Look, you could have
all the money in the world,

20:49.375 --> 20:52.125
but if you don't have what we have
right here, you've got nothing.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.959
- To friends
To friends.

21:00.834 --> 21:04.125
Ah. So do you think your wife will be mad
that you ditched her?

21:04.208 --> 21:06.583
Uh, excuse me, my wife has a name.

21:06.917 --> 21:09.125
Yeah, I may not know what it is,
but she has a name.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.583
They're not our wives.

21:11.667 --> 21:15.041
We're 13, there were no rings
and one of us was dressed like Elvis.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.834
Oh, really?
You might want to tell them that.

21:23.667 --> 21:26.041
Honey, I can explain.

21:27.083 --> 21:27.917
Run!
