00:22.063 --> 00:23.332
I'm in the business of love.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.499
Which is a pretty good business
when you think about it.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.615
Bright-eyed couples, gushing with hope,

00:32.698 --> 00:35.452
come to me because they've found someone
who makes them so happy

00:35.535 --> 00:38.095
that they've decided to spend
the rest of their lives together.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.168
And it's my duty as a wedding planner

00:43.251 --> 00:45.420
to make their wedding days
even more wonderful

00:45.503 --> 00:46.880
than they could have imagined.

00:53.052 --> 00:56.139
Currently, I am planning my cousin Emily's
Christmas Eve wedding,

00:56.222 --> 00:59.309
and as you can see,
the stress meter has passed a thousand.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.312
That's... that's not me.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.396
Whoa!

01:03.855 --> 01:04.855
That's me.

01:04.938 --> 01:07.317
Sorry. I...

01:07.400 --> 01:10.945
My purse broke, and I'm already late.

01:11.821 --> 01:12.822
You don't care.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.824
- Why am I telling you?
- No.

01:17.869 --> 01:21.456
And this is how I started
planning the most insane wedding ever.

01:27.003 --> 01:31.257
Just some minor mishaps. Explain later.

01:35.303 --> 01:39.516
Just picking up the final touch
to make this morning perfect.

01:41.100 --> 01:44.062
I'll admit, this is my first real wedding,

01:44.145 --> 01:46.981
and I need to avoid all distractions.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.316
Umph!

01:48.399 --> 01:49.818
- You...
- Sorry. What?

01:52.278 --> 01:53.530
Are you OK?

01:54.781 --> 01:55.865
Distraction.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.785
Yes. Sorry, it was my fault.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.246
I should have been paying attention
to where I was going.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.540
After you.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.459
Hi there. Welcome to Cheery Beans

02:06.543 --> 02:08.586
where our coffee
will leave you with a smile.

02:08.669 --> 02:10.630
May I get you one of our seasonal coffees?

02:12.757 --> 02:14.759
After you. It's the least I can do.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.136
You sure?

02:16.636 --> 02:18.429
- Yup.
- Thanks.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.307
- Hey there.
- Welcome to Cheery Beans

02:21.391 --> 02:23.077
where our coffee
will leave you with a smile.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.853
May I get you
one of our seasonal delights?

02:25.770 --> 02:27.355
You got to say that every time, huh?

02:28.106 --> 02:32.193
OK. Yeah, I'll get twelve coffees,
cream and sugar on the side,

02:32.277 --> 02:35.113
twelve muffins and one of your
famous blueberry scones.

02:35.655 --> 02:36.739
Thanks.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.244
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.455
What do you think
about a snowflake ice sculpture?

02:44.664 --> 02:46.749
That goes with my whole
Winter Bliss theme, right?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.419
Yeah, I can look into it.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.672
OK, yeah, and see if they make silver ice.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.549
OK, I'll talk to you later.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.014
Hello.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.141
I'm hearing talk of ice sculptures.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.935
We are not hosting a wedding
on a cruise ship.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.147
Please see that this does not happen.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.107
Yup.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.650
OK, no problem.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.111
OK, see you later. OK, bye.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.406
Now, don't you try
and drink all these yourself.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.534
I'll try not to.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.785
Thanks, pal.

03:24.495 --> 03:25.997
Thanks for letting me go ahead.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.415
No problem.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.293
- Hi...
- Welcome to Cheery Beans

03:30.376 --> 03:31.437
where our coffee will leave you with...

03:31.461 --> 03:33.606
It's... It's OK, I was here
the first two times you said it.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.257
Can I please have one blueberry scone?

03:36.591 --> 03:38.134
I'm so sorry.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.720
I just sold the last one
to that handsome gentleman.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.389
What? Really?

03:43.473 --> 03:45.099
We have a delicious cheddar and chive

03:45.183 --> 03:47.936
or a seasonal white chocolate
and cranberry.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.813
You don't understand.
I need a blueberry scone.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.191
I can get you a blueberry muffin?

03:56.319 --> 03:57.695
I am a fierce warrior.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.452
Hi. Excuse me.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.037
Hi.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.914
Hi....

04:07.997 --> 04:11.000
I was over there and I was trying to buy
one of the blueberry scones...

04:11.084 --> 04:13.044
They make the best in town.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.714
Yeah, right,
except you bought the last one.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.218
OK, see, it's... its not for me.

04:20.301 --> 04:23.596
And a therapist might say that
I'm, trying to buy someone's love,

04:23.680 --> 04:25.348
which may or may not be true.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.433
Either way...

04:28.226 --> 04:31.104
I need that scone
and I would love to buy it from you,

04:31.187 --> 04:32.939
and I will pay you double.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.648
Yes!

04:34.857 --> 04:36.985
You know, I'm really sorry. I can't.

04:37.944 --> 04:38.944
Triple.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.238
Not possible.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.364
OK.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.033
I will give you...

04:46.536 --> 04:51.082
seven dollars and this... gift card
to, I don't know where.

04:51.165 --> 04:55.378
But, yeah, you can have the money
and the mystery card for the scone.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.629
What do you say?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.842
I really wish I could. I'm sorry.

05:01.718 --> 05:02.719
Excuse me.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.721
Thanks.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.227
I have a plain scone

05:11.894 --> 05:13.730
and blueberries from my lunch.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.042
I'm well on my way
to destroying my business

05:34.125 --> 05:35.668
before it even starts.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.545
Step one,

05:37.879 --> 05:40.798
arrive late at an engagement party
that I am throwing.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.134
Step two,

05:43.968 --> 05:46.471
do not acquire a blueberry scone
for sucking up.

05:48.389 --> 05:52.769
Step three, fail miserably, buy cats,
spend the rest of my life

05:52.852 --> 05:56.355
shopping from television
in middle of the night.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.689
Ha.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.068
Here goes everything.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.694
Love you muchly.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.842
Kelsey! Kelsey!

06:24.926 --> 06:25.968
Hi.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.179
My cousin Emily.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.473
The sweetest woman on the planet,

06:30.598 --> 06:32.934
and the closest thing
I've ever had to a sister.

06:33.017 --> 06:36.729
Stunning, rich and oozing kindness.

06:36.854 --> 06:40.650
I should probably hate her,
but... it's impossible.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.236
- Emily, you look incredible!
- Thank you.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.798
- Why are we whispering?
- Because no one's seen me yet

06:45.822 --> 06:47.281
and I want to make an entrance.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.366
Go in and announce me.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.129
You're so funny. OK, go in there and wait.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.410
OK. Quick!

06:55.706 --> 06:58.042
Hello, Aunt Olivia. Sorry, I'm late.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.921
Tardiness does not suit a new business.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.923
Aunt Olivia.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.926
The very definition of rich and powerful.

07:07.009 --> 07:10.304
And the closest thing
I have to a role model.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.515
I know, I'm... I'm sorry.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.683
My purse broke on me,

07:13.766 --> 07:15.726
and then I tried to get you
the blueberry scone...

07:15.768 --> 07:19.272
Nobody appreciates the charming tales
of your mishaps more than I do,

07:19.355 --> 07:20.815
but it is time to greet our guests.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.276
Absolutely, I agree.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.778
And I assume everything else is in order?

07:25.862 --> 07:27.071
One hundred percent.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.240
The dress fitting
is scheduled for Tuesday.

07:29.323 --> 07:32.123
We are set to bake the cookie giveaway
with my friend Sharl, the baker.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.911
I am prepping for the bachelorette party

07:33.995 --> 07:36.164
and I'm finalizing
with the caterer on Sunday.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.040
- Well done, Kelsey.
- Thank you.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.835
I took the liberty
of inviting Marianne Kemp

07:40.918 --> 07:42.962
to do a piece on Emily's wedding.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.715
And despite my distaste for the woman,

07:45.798 --> 07:49.385
if you impress her, it's safe to say
that your business will flourish.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.680
Thank you.
That is, that's so nice of you.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.515
And I promise I won't disappoint you.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.808
You never do.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.572
The rare Aunt Olivia compliment.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.520
Except for that blueberry scone.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.689
- There it goes.
- Thank you.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.232
I tried to get...

08:03.316 --> 08:05.276
Luckily, someone else brought one.

08:07.528 --> 08:08.529
Who?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.581
Hi.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.417
This looks so great.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.213
Hello, everyone.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.799
I would like to thank you all
for joining us this morning.

08:28.883 --> 08:32.470
We will be making a formal announcement
in a little bit, but for now

08:32.553 --> 08:37.892
I would like to present to you,
the bride-to-be, Miss Emily Wilson.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.688
Thank you for that, Kelsey.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.858
It was so kind and unexpected.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.079
How was the scone?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.456
It wasn't for me.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.792
It's her favorite.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.463
Is that some sort of lucky guess?

09:08.047 --> 09:09.340
No, I did my research.

09:10.132 --> 09:11.634
It's part of my job, Kelsey.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.305
So you knew who I was?

09:17.139 --> 09:18.599
Well, not for sure.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.186
I, I saw some pictures. Old ones.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.125
What did you say your name was again?

09:24.188 --> 09:25.314
I didn't.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.900
- Emily, you look incredible.
- Hi.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.570
Please, I completely forgot
this was happening today.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.405
So you two have met?

09:32.905 --> 09:34.841
Yeah. Yeah, we met this morning
at the coffee shop.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.159
She has seven dollars.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.621
Yes, I do.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.665
Kelsey. A moment.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.667
Excuse me.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.837
So... this is happening.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.381
I want to introduce you to Marianne Kemp.

09:50.464 --> 09:53.926
She is the chief editor
of Wedding DuJour Magazine.com.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.927
Charmed.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.220
Pleasure to meet you.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.472
Kelsey is quite a firecracker.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.409
She just started her own
wedding planning business

10:00.433 --> 10:01.753
and she is doing Emily's wedding.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.437
You're a very brave entrepreneur.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.939
Throwing your first wedding
for your own family.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.858
You're gonna need a lot of luck.

10:08.941 --> 10:12.528
Well, I believe the harder I work,
the luckier I'll be.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.615
That's the small business spirit
I like to see.

10:15.698 --> 10:19.535
Now, Olivia told me that the ceremony
is gonna be quite exclusive.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.039
Yes, immediate family only.
Followed by a grand reception.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.433
Tell me you have a great photographer.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.499
Only the best.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.294
Talented, artistic
and a very impressive portfolio.

10:28.377 --> 10:29.670
Do I know him?

10:37.136 --> 10:38.179
Great.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.806
So give me the photos
as soon as the wedding is over,

10:40.890 --> 10:43.410
and an interview with the bride and groom,
and I'll see what I can do.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.186
Olivia.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.482
Well, you handled that very well.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.026
- Thank you.
- But can you handle that?

10:53.194 --> 10:54.630
- Who is he?
- That, my dear,

10:54.654 --> 10:56.254
is the greatest threat to your business.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.531
How so?

10:57.615 --> 10:58.741
Connor McClane.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.204
- Em, Emily's ex, Connor McClane?
- One and only.

11:03.287 --> 11:06.040
Why is he here?
Didn't he... break her heart or something?

11:06.123 --> 11:07.625
Well, you could say that.

11:07.708 --> 11:11.212
Well, he could be planning to
ruin Emily's wedding, or your company,

11:11.295 --> 11:13.255
or to steal all of our family money.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.549
I wouldn't put anything past him.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.176
Better take care of that.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.136
I'm on it.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.224
I am a fierce warrior!

11:26.227 --> 11:27.978
- I'd like a...
- One second.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.815
OK,
I will be a polite fierce warrior

11:30.898 --> 11:33.567
and wait until he's finished talking.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.821
And before I knew it, I'd lost my pants.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.782
That's so funny.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.241
One sec.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.387
Sorry about that, Kelsey.
What were you saying?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.703
I'd like you to leave.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.330
Sorry, what?

11:46.414 --> 11:48.433
Yeah, you can't just storm in here
and then try to ruin

11:48.457 --> 11:50.292
Emily's perfect Christmas Eve
dream wedding

11:50.376 --> 11:51.978
- and then crush her heart again.
- Whoa, hold on, hold on.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.254
I'm not gonna crush her heart.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.381
We're friends now, OK?

11:55.464 --> 11:57.784
I just got into town
and she invited me over for an eggnog.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.596
This conversation is not over.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.766
I would like to thank you all
for joining us today

12:05.850 --> 12:09.728
in the celebration
of my daughter Emily's engagement

12:09.812 --> 12:12.481
to her charming fiancé Todd.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.358
Todd Brannigan,

12:14.442 --> 12:17.027
the definition of charm.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.363
They met when Emily volunteered
for his charity.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.906
Seems like a nice guy.

12:20.990 --> 12:21.990
He is.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.828
I only wish that, my husband Albert

12:25.911 --> 12:29.290
were here today to, celebrate with us.

12:29.707 --> 12:34.295
But I am sure that he would be
pleased to see all of your kind faces.

12:34.378 --> 12:39.341
So join me in a toast
to Emily and to Todd.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.346
Cheers.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.121
Look, honestly,
you have nothing to worry about

12:51.145 --> 12:53.230
when it comes to Emily and I. I promise.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.732
Good to know.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.276
But, I can't promise
their wedding won't be ruined.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.195
Ooh. Great party.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.654
Wait, what?

13:01.489 --> 13:02.823
- Hey!
- Excuse me.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.366
Hi.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.495
Thank you.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.122
All right. Thanks.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.124
Hey! Wait a minute.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.001
Sorry. I gotta go.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.377
No, not so fast...

13:18.839 --> 13:20.633
- Can I get your...
- No, thank you.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.438
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:34.522 --> 13:38.442
You can't just say you're here
to ruin a wedding and then just walk away.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.945
But I just did.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.198
You said you don't have feelings
for Emily.

13:44.907 --> 13:45.907
I don't.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.453
OK, then what is your problem?
You just don't want her to be happy?

13:49.537 --> 13:51.288
Look, here's the deal, Kels.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.124
- Can I call you Kels?
- No, you may not.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.335
All right, the truth is,

13:56.961 --> 13:58.295
I'm a private investigator.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.379
I was hired to look into Todd.
That's why I'm here.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.174
OK, who hired you?

14:02.258 --> 14:04.468
Sorry, PI client privilege.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.930
You expect me to believe
that some mysterious person

14:08.013 --> 14:10.599
hired you to ruin this wedding.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.077
Well, technically, to look into Todd.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.603
But, ruining the wedding
is a potential outcome

14:14.687 --> 14:16.207
if my client's suspicions are correct.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.149
OK, well, then you're out of luck, Buck-O.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.570
Tell me
I didn't just say "Buck-O"?

14:23.404 --> 14:26.448
Because I know Todd,
and he is a great guy so...

14:27.449 --> 14:29.910
Well, then you've got
nothing to worry about, right?

14:29.994 --> 14:31.787
Yeah, I guess I don't.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.337
You know...

14:41.130 --> 14:43.799
if you want to make sure
the wedding goes off without a hitch,

14:43.883 --> 14:45.217
you could always help me out.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.011
We could be a team.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.555
I'm not helping you.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.638
All right.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.099
Have it your way, Kels.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.101
Just thought I'd offer an olive branch.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.686
I'm sure I'll see you around.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.873
And if you change your mind,
I'm gonna be at George's.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.207
It's a little restaurant downtown.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.442
I'm... I'm not going to change my mind.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.325
- Cellphone chimes.
- Just an update.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.535
Engagement party went well

15:11.619 --> 15:14.747
despite a small hiccup
when Emily's ex showed up.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.458
About to supervise
the wedding dress fitting.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.669
Yes, it might cost more than my home.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.630
Love you muchly.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.299
Kelsey!

15:25.633 --> 15:26.634
- You made it.
- Yes.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.469
And I brought the squad.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.804
Bridesmaids.

15:30.888 --> 15:34.266
The honor can bring out the best
and worst in people.

15:34.934 --> 15:35.934
Hi!

15:35.976 --> 15:37.436
The Jealous Bridesmaid.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.898
Wishes it were her wedding,
describes everything as if it were hers.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.775
Seriously, Em,

15:42.858 --> 15:46.445
this is the exact same place
I was gonna buy my wedding dress.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.074
Oh, well, great minds think alike.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.925
We're just in here if you want to...

16:00.292 --> 16:01.572
The Bitter bridesmaid.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.629
Recently divorced
with bitterness still intact.

16:03.712 --> 16:04.880
Sweetie.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.423
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.175
- Hi.
- You know,

16:08.258 --> 16:10.719
it's not too late.
We could still go to Fiji.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.306
Girls only.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.352
- Maybe.
- No, no Fiji.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.939
We're just in there
if you want to just, go, go in there.

16:22.648 --> 16:27.152
And of course, the lovely
but happens to be a Clumsy Bridesmaid.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.196
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.824
It's, it's icing.
I had a cupcake in the car.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.909
It's... it's all good.
Don't worry about it.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.413
OK.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.540
Advice.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.126
My mom still wants me to wear
the Wilson dress.

16:42.209 --> 16:45.379
How do I sugarcoat "ew"
so that I don't hurt her feelings?

16:46.130 --> 16:48.132
Traditional, family dresses.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.093
Mothers love them, brides hate them.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.678
This one has been handed down

16:52.761 --> 16:55.347
from a few generations
of Wilson women before us.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.433
For anyone taking notes,

16:57.516 --> 17:01.353
how you handle this situation
can define you as a wedding planner.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.023
OK. Let me handle it.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.377
I'll sugarcoat it without her knowing.

17:07.401 --> 17:10.820
I'll say you still have that one
in mind but,

17:10.904 --> 17:14.992
you're going to take this one
as an option for back up.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.785
You're the best.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.165
What did she say?

17:23.125 --> 17:26.462
She said "That was so sugarcoated,
it gave me diabetes."

17:31.341 --> 17:32.926
- I've got to take this so...
- Yeah.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.304
- Yeah... go in there.
- OK, OK, yeah.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.973
This is Kelsey.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.308
Hey, Kels.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.560
Give any more thought to my offer?

17:43.520 --> 17:44.396
Connor?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.648
See, you make a great PI sidekick.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.152
How did you get my...

17:50.903 --> 17:52.029
Nevermind.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.949
Look, I'm pretty busy right now,
I don't, I don't have time for this...

17:56.033 --> 17:58.869
Yeah, having the perfect dress
is important.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.789
I just hope she gets to wear it.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.042
Think about my offer.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.553
- Is this everyone?
- Yeah.

18:16.637 --> 18:17.721
OK.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.182
Kelsey.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.936
So for my wedding I was thinking
of having a tropical theme.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.021
Is that something you think you can do?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.981
Yeah, of course. When's your wedding?

18:28.774 --> 18:30.567
I don't have a date set yet.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.112
Or a boyfriend.
But I will by December next year.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.281
Don't you guys just love
Christmas weddings?

18:36.365 --> 18:38.534
Hey, what about Connor?

18:39.201 --> 18:40.744
I saw him at the party.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.081
I mean, I know he's a little bit
of a ding-bat, but...

18:44.164 --> 18:45.916
Does anybody know if he's single?

18:45.999 --> 18:49.461
- Who's Connor?
- He's Emily's Ex.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.673
Don't get me started on ex's.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.842
Em met him on spring break.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.427
When she introduced him
to Mama Olivia and Daddy Albert,

18:57.511 --> 19:02.141
they did not approve, which of course,
only made Emily fall harder for him.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.851
She talked about dropping out of school

19:03.934 --> 19:05.769
and moving in with him and everything.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.020
Really?

19:07.729 --> 19:09.314
I didn't know they were that serious.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.316
Well, they definitely were.

19:11.400 --> 19:15.070
And one day out of the blue,
Connor made an exit.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.990
No call, no text, no nothing.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.074
Just gone.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.869
Poor Emily.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.330
Well, like the saying goes,
"Give a guy your heart,

19:25.414 --> 19:28.917
and he'll make out with your sister
in the closet at a family reunion."

19:29.293 --> 19:30.293
Is that Nietzsche?

19:30.335 --> 19:31.712
Anyone want a cookie?

19:32.212 --> 19:34.131
Oh, dear God.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.052
- You guys ready?
- Yes.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.136
- Yes.
- Yeah.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.388
Yeah.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.099
OK, here it goes.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.406
I think even your mom's gonna
forget about the Wilson dress.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.867
So... we settled?

20:03.243 --> 20:04.578
I love it.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.639
Emily, you look beautiful.

20:06.663 --> 20:07.706
Thank you.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.835
And in the same dress
I wanted for my Christmas wedding.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.420
You just have it all.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.298
A little tight on the hug.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.134
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. So pretty.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.636
Thank you.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.638
Hello?

20:22.721 --> 20:25.349
Don't come in. You can't see my dress.

20:25.432 --> 20:28.393
I promise, I'm not here
to barge in on girl time.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.519
Yeah, right.

20:29.603 --> 20:30.729
OK, just a second.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.291
Here, you go in the dressing room
and take this off,

20:33.315 --> 20:34.667
and we'll go figure out what Todd wants.

20:34.691 --> 20:35.734
OK.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.118
Is it safe?

20:45.369 --> 20:46.745
Yes, Todd.

20:49.998 --> 20:53.919
So... how's everything going?

20:54.002 --> 20:56.838
Great. Her dress is perfect.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.423
Fantastic.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.677
Look, I'm not gonna stay,
I just thought I'd stop by with,

21:01.760 --> 21:04.096
a little surprise
for all you lovely ladies.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.139
- That's... You, Kels.
- Thank you.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.367
- You want to hand them out?
- Yeah.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.391
Cool.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.729
Yes, thank you, Todd. Very kind of you.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.315
Don't be silly.
Anything to keep my girls happy.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.067
- Can you make sure Em gets this?
- Yeah.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.611
Let her know extra love.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.906
OK, well, I'm running a little late.
I got to run.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.535
- See you guys soon. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.377
I got to take this, it's the caterer.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.189
Hi, Marco. How's everything going?

21:38.213 --> 21:40.716
Look, is it going to kill me
to fly in those lobsters?

21:43.176 --> 21:46.013
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
Why... Why are you...

21:46.596 --> 21:47.639
Why are you crying?

21:47.723 --> 21:49.808
- Stop. No.
- What's this?

21:54.229 --> 21:55.939
What do you mean
you can't do the wedding?

21:57.566 --> 21:58.942
Look...

21:59.484 --> 22:01.379
I'm sorry that you and your wife
are breaking up

22:01.403 --> 22:03.864
and a wedding would be
too hard for you but...

22:19.171 --> 22:20.464
You can't do this.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.883
You're cheating!

22:23.633 --> 22:26.094
No, not you. Sorry.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.805
Well, yeah, yeah, you.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.599
We had a deal.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.810
Marco?

22:37.731 --> 22:40.275
- That was really good.
- Thanks.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.408
Find something you liked?

22:48.492 --> 22:51.119
Maybe I should be asking
you that.

22:51.828 --> 22:55.165
Yes. Emily loved the Stevenson dress.

22:55.248 --> 22:56.666
Perfect.

23:04.257 --> 23:06.802
So, is... is that a real Degas?

23:06.885 --> 23:08.678
Yeah, actually we got this at...

23:08.762 --> 23:11.240
Michelle, I love your place.
Thank you so much for all of your help.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.516
My pleasure.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.060
Hey, enough of the girly stuff.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.687
Can we please plan
your bachelorette party?

23:18.396 --> 23:20.996
Look, all I care about is that
I get to spend time with you girls.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.544
The last thing I want is to be
is one of those women in T-shirts

23:23.568 --> 23:25.403
acting like it's her last night on Earth.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.887
- Oh, isn't that what we already...
- Oh, no, we don't.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.334
Are those cookies from,
Sharl's bakery?

23:43.380 --> 23:44.965
He's making Emily's wedding cake.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.342
They sure are.
I pick them up fresh every morning.

23:47.425 --> 23:48.760
Would you like one?

23:51.847 --> 23:52.847
No.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.183
OK, maybe one.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.727
Bye.

24:04.192 --> 24:05.735
Morning, Sharl.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.741
I don't like this,
I don't like this at all.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.661
Sharl, look, we went over this, OK?
It's gonna be fine.

24:15.078 --> 24:18.707
And... I really
need your help on this one, OK.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.250
And I will owe you big time.

24:20.333 --> 24:23.086
I'm... I'm a terrible liar.
This isn't going to work.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.754
But you're not lying.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.173
But I already told Michelle

24:26.256 --> 24:28.317
that she could pick up her cookies
from here instead of the bakery.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.927
Why would I tell her to come here?
Why am I here?

24:31.011 --> 24:36.016
Because you are giving Emily
and I a private baking lesson,

24:36.391 --> 24:38.018
and, that's all true.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.312
I suppose so but...

24:40.854 --> 24:43.732
Just keep her here long enough
so she steps away from her bag,

24:43.940 --> 24:47.861
I can do my thing and then you just,
just send her on her way, OK?

24:47.944 --> 24:49.196
But my cookies, I...

24:49.279 --> 24:51.281
Her cookies are ready now.

24:51.364 --> 24:54.534
How do I tell her that her cookies
aren't ready when they are ready.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.040
OK, I'm only doing this,

25:00.248 --> 25:01.833
so you don't have to lie.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.668
Wha... Wha, what?

25:04.753 --> 25:07.214
What are you doing? Don't. No.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.016
Sharl? Everything all right?

25:18.308 --> 25:21.978
He's fine, just had a little
mishap with the ribbon.

25:23.021 --> 25:27.234
She's going to be here in 10 minutes
and that's not enough time.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.736
Want to make some gingerbread?

25:29.819 --> 25:30.862
I'm ready.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.030
All right.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.823
Are you sure this is a good idea?

25:33.907 --> 25:36.910
I'm going to be giving
my first ever attempt at gingerbread

25:36.993 --> 25:38.787
to every guest at my wedding reception.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.747
And the senator's going to be there.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.874
Well, that will just make them
appreciate it more

25:42.958 --> 25:43.958
because it came from you.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.380
And besides, Sharl will be here
to make sure you don't make any mistakes.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.508
Morning, Sharl. Sorry, I'm a little early.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.095
Hi, Emily. And Kelsey, right?

25:55.553 --> 25:57.222
Michelle, what a nice surprise.

25:57.305 --> 26:00.100
Having a private class with Sharl?
He's the best, isn't he?

26:01.142 --> 26:02.227
The best.

26:02.644 --> 26:03.812
I'm so sorry, Michelle,

26:03.895 --> 26:06.165
to make you come all the way down here
to pick up today's cookies.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.275
I know how strange that must be for you.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.403
Not really, you always have me come by
if you have a private class.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.321
Like, last week, remember?

26:15.240 --> 26:16.950
I suppose I do.

26:17.033 --> 26:20.453
Well, your cookies
are just about ready and...

26:20.537 --> 26:22.872
Almost...

26:23.164 --> 26:26.459
not, not ready, they're not, not ready.

26:29.504 --> 26:33.425
Well, Michelle, why don't you just
take a walk or go freshen up or something

26:33.508 --> 26:34.610
while you wait for the cookies.

26:34.634 --> 26:35.844
I'm OK, thank you.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.721
They look like
they're almost ready anyway.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.648
No, no, no, no.

26:48.732 --> 26:51.192
This flour
hasn't been sifted yet

26:51.276 --> 26:54.571
and you cannot mix baking soda
with flour that hasn't been sifted yet,

26:54.654 --> 26:57.240
and this bowl
is made for wet ingredients only.

26:57.657 --> 26:59.492
What are you trying to do to me?

26:59.576 --> 27:02.287
Michelle, I am so sorry,
it's just going to be a few more minutes.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.704
No matter, I just have to call the shop
and make sure Kenda can open for me.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.504
- No.
- Kelsey!

27:11.588 --> 27:15.425
I'm so, I'm so sorry.
I'm so clumsy.

27:16.259 --> 27:20.430
Why don't you go wash up
and I'll help Sharl clean this situation?

27:21.431 --> 27:23.016
I would rather you didn't, thank you.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.230
Please be harmless, please be harmless.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.153
"Hey, gorgeous, thanks for the hook up.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.656
Dinner on Wednesday at Turbo?"

27:43.161 --> 27:47.374
Hey, sorry, I just, I just spilt flour
everywhere and I got some on your purse.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.834
Thank you. You didn't have to do that.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.878
You know what, Sharl,
I really have to get going.

27:51.961 --> 27:53.564
Do you think
I could just take these as is?

27:53.588 --> 27:55.316
- I think they look stunning.
- Actually, the ribbon hasn't really been

27:55.340 --> 27:57.175
curled yet, so if...

27:57.258 --> 27:59.111
I promise I won't let anyone see them.
Thank you.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.387
But...

28:05.266 --> 28:08.895
Kelsey, never do that to me again.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.817
Can we start cooking?

28:14.317 --> 28:17.237
It's called baking, my dear, baking.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.576
Now, gingerbread
is not your average cookie.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.662
No, it holds a dark history

28:25.745 --> 28:28.873
that you must understand
before you can create your own.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.127
Now the...

28:34.546 --> 28:38.049
The Armenian monk Gregory of Nicopolis
first brought gingerbread

28:38.133 --> 28:41.928
to Europe in the year 992
but, this is where it get's interesting,

28:42.011 --> 28:46.057
you see, gingerbread
is not a gingerbread cookie at all,

28:46.141 --> 28:50.729
no, in fact,
it is a comestible sweet loaf.

28:51.354 --> 28:52.856
Ooh.

29:16.045 --> 29:18.131
OK, here are my terms.

29:18.381 --> 29:22.677
I will help you look into Todd
and in return you will tell me everything.

29:22.761 --> 29:27.724
No secrets. And if, and I stress "if,"
we find anything,

29:28.224 --> 29:30.894
I will be the one to tell Emily, not you.
Clear?

29:30.977 --> 29:32.103
Yeah, that's so weird

29:32.187 --> 29:34.587
because that was going to be
my speech to you, word for word.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.902
- I knew this was a mistake.
- Relax, I was kidding.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.865
Very well.
How do we start PI'ing?

29:44.741 --> 29:47.243
Well, first we order a bite
because I'm starving,

29:47.327 --> 29:48.953
and a lady has got to eat and...

29:49.037 --> 29:51.080
this is the best food
you're ever going to have.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.624
Let me order you something.

29:52.707 --> 29:56.211
No, I am here on professional terms
and I can order my own food.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.130
I only suggested it because

29:59.214 --> 30:00.694
I've had pretty much everything here.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.302
Well, how about I order your food for you.

30:05.887 --> 30:06.887
OK.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.723
Hey, hey, hey, Connor.

30:10.099 --> 30:12.852
I didn't know you were having a date?

30:12.936 --> 30:14.413
- Oh, no, it's not a date.
- It's not a date.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.605
We're PI's.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.023
What?

30:19.275 --> 30:22.153
OK, well, I will have
whatever you are making back there

30:22.237 --> 30:26.074
that smells so fantastic,
and the gentleman will have...

30:26.157 --> 30:30.078
the... lobster.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.706
Lobster.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.708
You OK with that?

30:36.376 --> 30:38.378
Yeah, it's a professional meeting.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.046
I like to be accommodating.

30:40.755 --> 30:43.675
Professional, accommodating, you?

30:48.721 --> 30:50.390
I'll just get your food.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.561
OK, first thing's first.

30:55.562 --> 30:56.562
Who hired you?

30:56.604 --> 30:59.774
- Can't tell you.
- What? We just said no secrets.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.442
PI Code of Conduct.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.320
Anything else I'm an open book, OK?

31:06.531 --> 31:08.867
So, what made you change your mind?

31:09.993 --> 31:14.455
Well, if, if Todd isn't who he says he is,
then I want to help protect Emily.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.666
You two are close, huh?

31:16.791 --> 31:18.042
Yeah.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.920
OK, well, what did you find?

31:21.796 --> 31:26.467
He has some unpaid parking tickets,
stole a candy bar when he was nine.

31:26.593 --> 31:30.388
I thought you were like,
good at your job or something.

31:33.474 --> 31:35.226
Well, I guess not.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.979
But I did find a few leads
that would suggest his family

31:38.062 --> 31:40.148
is not as well off as they say they are.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.941
Do you think he's after their money?

31:42.025 --> 31:43.526
Yeah, it's a concern.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.945
How not well off is he?

31:46.029 --> 31:48.031
I'm thinking bankrupt, but...

31:48.531 --> 31:51.159
I wouldn't know
unless I got into his father's computer.

31:52.410 --> 31:55.450
You know, they're having a tree trimming
party tomorrow night at their house.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.750
- I'm guessing you're invited, right?
- Yes, I helped plan it.

31:59.626 --> 32:00.626
Why?

32:00.668 --> 32:02.348
That's perfect
because I could go in there,

32:02.420 --> 32:04.130
check out his finances, OK?

32:04.213 --> 32:05.965
- What a perfect idea you just had.
- No!

32:06.758 --> 32:07.967
OK, s... sure.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.511
I'm just gonna waltz in there
with Emily's ex-boyfriend

32:10.595 --> 32:12.740
and everything's gonna be fine,
no one's gonna be suspicious.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.474
- And no one will...
- It's perfect.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.267
It really is. Brilliant.

32:16.351 --> 32:20.939
All right. I got the penne arrabiata
for the lovely lady,

32:21.731 --> 32:26.361
and the fantastic... lobster for you.

32:26.694 --> 32:28.321
Thank you. Best friend.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.365
What are best friend's for.

32:38.164 --> 32:39.415
This is incredible.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.378
I know, I mean, I made it myself,
of course it's gotta be good.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.880
I mean, hey, Italian. Italiano.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.465
So good!

32:48.174 --> 32:51.135
Yeah, but, really seriously,
that means a lot, thank you so much.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.639
No, seriously, this is, amazing.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.893
Have you ever considered
catering a wedding?

32:59.060 --> 33:03.773
I've never done one,
but I'm sure I could.

33:03.856 --> 33:05.216
I just have to talk to my partner.

33:06.734 --> 33:09.737
Connor, what do you think?
Can we do a wedding?

33:11.406 --> 33:13.449
Yeah, I don't see why not.

33:16.035 --> 33:17.537
This is your place?

33:17.620 --> 33:19.706
Pump the breaks, sister.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.250
It's actually our place.

33:23.584 --> 33:24.627
Don't get it twisted, OK.

33:24.711 --> 33:28.798
Of course, he's the money,
I am the talent.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.968
Of course the looks. The brains.

33:32.051 --> 33:34.470
And also your server.

33:36.472 --> 33:38.224
Just hire somebody already. OK?

33:38.307 --> 33:40.184
Yeah. Enjoy your food. And I'll...

33:40.268 --> 33:43.938
let you keep discussing your PI work
or whatever you're doing.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.142
You look good in that shirt.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.278
And by the way, enjoy the lobster.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.159
Well, you are full of surprises.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.202
One or two.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.124
You're not eating?

34:03.791 --> 34:08.504
I could, but I'm allergic
to shellfish, so if I do, I'll, I'll die.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.724
I'm so sorry.
You want to, you want to switch?

34:13.801 --> 34:15.161
Only if you want to keep me alive?

34:17.179 --> 34:19.431
- OK, for now.
- OK.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.835
Hello?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.297
Kelsey, my dear, I'm running
a little late to the party.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.739
No problem, Aunt. Do you need me
to do anything for you?

34:54.257 --> 34:56.527
Well, I'm trying to avoid
having to listen to Tim and Linda

34:56.552 --> 34:58.846
talk about their boat
for as long as I can.

34:59.013 --> 35:00.681
Will you make an excuse for me?

35:01.682 --> 35:03.101
Consider it done.

35:05.394 --> 35:08.606
Not even sure how to explain
what I'm about to do.

35:08.689 --> 35:12.527
I'm waiting for someone,
who could potentially lead to the downfall

35:12.610 --> 35:14.403
of my first wedding gig.

35:14.487 --> 35:17.198
I send you this
to assure you that, as always,

35:17.281 --> 35:19.117
I have no clue what I'm doing!

35:19.492 --> 35:21.369
Love you muchly.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.144
You're late.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.780
Only if you're
looking at the clock.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.986
No, please, after you.

35:55.653 --> 35:56.946
Did you say something?

35:57.029 --> 35:58.156
Come on.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.743
- So where's the study?
- Upstairs. Why?

36:02.827 --> 36:04.829
OK, well, I got to get on his computer.

36:08.082 --> 36:09.375
Actually, I can make this work.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.961
- Follow my lead.
- OK, no...

36:12.044 --> 36:13.689
I would like to remind you that
I have an actual job

36:13.713 --> 36:14.839
to take care of here.

36:14.922 --> 36:17.562
Yeah, perfectly. You can do your little
job thing to distract them.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.511
You seriously didn't just say
my little job thing?

36:20.595 --> 36:21.804
- I did.
- Kelsey.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.932
Glad you could make it.

36:25.850 --> 36:29.687
Good afternoon, Mr. Brannigan.
You have a lovely home.

36:30.062 --> 36:33.232
Well, it better be. Cost me a fortune.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.193
Yes, sir...

36:35.276 --> 36:38.112
- I'd like to introduce you to Connor.
- Kelsey's boyfriend.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.323
- Nice to meet you.
- You as well.

36:40.948 --> 36:41.967
Well, you have to forgive me.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.671
We're a little understaffed at the moment.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.412
I had to fire
some of the help for stealing.

36:46.495 --> 36:47.914
The nerve of some people.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.416
I know. Who can you trust these days, huh?

36:50.499 --> 36:51.584
Exactly.

36:51.667 --> 36:52.667
Excuse me.

36:54.962 --> 36:57.340
Under staffed? This guy's broke.

36:57.423 --> 36:59.592
Hey.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.344
- What?
- Boyfriend?

37:01.636 --> 37:03.236
Yeah, I thought it would be the easiest.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.555
Why, what was your cover?

37:04.639 --> 37:06.867
I was going to say you were
catering the party, you know...

37:06.891 --> 37:08.100
the truth.

37:08.184 --> 37:10.978
That would have been good. Yeah.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.981
Well, it looks like everyone's busy here.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.776
Stand guard,
I'm gonna go search the house.

37:17.944 --> 37:18.944
Connor!

37:19.570 --> 37:20.863
Kelsey.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.033
You remember Linda, my better half?

37:24.909 --> 37:28.287
Hi. Yes, of course, hi.
What a beautiful party.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.748
Nothing but the best for our Todd.

37:30.831 --> 37:32.541
Have you been out to our boat?

37:32.625 --> 37:35.461
I've been toying with the idea
of painting it again.

37:38.047 --> 37:40.925
But really, the whole thing
was just so gauche.

37:41.008 --> 37:43.552
I could do without it, honestly I could.

37:44.178 --> 37:45.763
Do they take a cut of your tips?

37:48.432 --> 37:49.809
OK.

37:50.726 --> 37:52.144
Kelsey.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.402
Yes?

37:59.485 --> 38:01.862
I was asking what you think of the idea?

38:04.949 --> 38:07.743
I, think it's a...

38:09.161 --> 38:12.623
- wonderful idea.
- Splendid.

38:13.082 --> 38:16.210
See, Kelsey agrees.
I'll sing for their first dance.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.379
Audiences alike have said

38:18.462 --> 38:22.258
I sound exactly like
Celine Dion.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.887
Well, then we're all in for a treat.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.724
I'm sure my aunt will love

38:29.807 --> 38:32.435
your rendition of "My Heart Will Go On."

38:32.518 --> 38:33.936
So they offered benefits?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.521
No, they don't offer benefits.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.315
How about maternity leave?

38:37.398 --> 38:39.650
Who do I have to kill
to get a drink around here?

38:40.443 --> 38:42.862
Oh, no. Oh, look, you. Ooh.
Oh, look, who I found.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.589
Look, I was looking for you
for so long...

38:44.613 --> 38:45.613
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.199
I should go.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.160
Here's my card. Find me at George's.

38:55.082 --> 38:58.753
We were just talking about weddings,

38:58.836 --> 39:02.673
and, yeah, what does your
dream wedding look like?

39:02.757 --> 39:06.427
Does my future husband own a law firm?
The answer's yes.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.679
Theme is simple, ice.
Everyone's on skates.

39:08.763 --> 39:11.283
Now I know what you're thinking,
where you gonna find a priest on skates?

39:11.307 --> 39:13.851
Well, taken care of. Canada.

39:13.934 --> 39:16.145
OK, don't let me stop you.
I'll be right back.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.620
Connor.

39:34.747 --> 39:35.747
Connor!

39:41.170 --> 39:42.630
Connor!

39:46.675 --> 39:48.094
We can't be in here. Hurry up.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.720
Come on, this is standard PI work.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.972
Go watch the door
while I try to get his password.

39:52.431 --> 39:54.308
Oh, crap.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.644
He's got a lot of security on here.

39:56.727 --> 40:00.022
Yeah, weird, how people like to
protect their financial information.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.566
It's OK, I can make an educated guess.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.486
And you know him, help me out here.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.572
No, look, I... I barely know him.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.301
Let's just get out of here
and we can figure something else out, OK?

40:11.325 --> 40:12.535
It's not hard.

40:12.618 --> 40:16.247
Guys like this always pick
something, arrogant.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.290
Come on, think.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.629
OK.

40:25.047 --> 40:26.215
OK.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.095
Is this normal?

40:31.387 --> 40:34.181
Do you always breathe this
heavily when you do this kind of thing?

40:38.018 --> 40:40.980
What am I doing? This is crazy.

40:45.943 --> 40:49.113
Try, "Get it all."

40:52.491 --> 40:55.202
That's it!

40:56.328 --> 40:58.205
You should consider doing this full time.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.350
OK, let's just take what we need
and get out of here.

41:00.374 --> 41:04.128
OK, copying files now.

41:04.211 --> 41:05.463
It should just take a minute.

41:05.546 --> 41:06.839
Can you make it go faster?

41:07.006 --> 41:08.257
Sure.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.550
- Really?
- No.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.236
Hold on,
I have a bottle in my office.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.554
That's bad.

41:23.564 --> 41:24.690
Kelsey.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.027
What is this?

41:28.486 --> 41:31.405
Mr. Bra... Brannigan.

41:32.281 --> 41:34.074
I'm, I'm so sorry...

41:34.909 --> 41:36.368
We were just trying to...

41:37.661 --> 41:41.040
get away, find a quiet place to...

41:41.874 --> 41:43.000
be alone.

41:44.835 --> 41:46.462
You know how women get?

41:46.545 --> 41:48.631
Got to keep them happy, huh?

41:54.720 --> 41:57.181
That we do, my boy, that we do.

42:03.062 --> 42:05.898
I'll, leave you to it.

42:06.815 --> 42:08.192
- Thanks.
- Bye.

42:42.101 --> 42:43.477
Yup.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.360
I know what that means.

42:53.862 --> 42:55.030
Now, Kelsey,

42:55.114 --> 42:57.866
tell me why we don't we push
little boys at the playground?

42:58.534 --> 43:03.414
Because a Wilson is a Wilson
inside and outside the house.

43:03.497 --> 43:05.624
Exactly. Good girl.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.002
Now, Kelsey,

43:08.085 --> 43:10.713
why don't we yell sexist pig
at our school principal?

43:11.130 --> 43:16.218
Because a Wilson is a Wilson
inside and outside the house.

43:16.302 --> 43:19.638
Exactly. Good girl.

43:19.722 --> 43:21.307
Kelsey,

43:21.390 --> 43:24.190
what do we say about sneaking out
in the middle of the night with boys?

43:24.685 --> 43:27.354
M... Make sure we shave our legs first?

43:30.482 --> 43:32.151
Don't do that,

43:32.234 --> 43:36.030
because a Wilson is a Wilson
inside and outside the house.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.657
Exactly. Good girl.

43:44.788 --> 43:47.416
I know, I'm late.

43:48.500 --> 43:51.754
Well, I see you didn't bring
your newest accessory, Connor.

43:53.172 --> 43:55.424
Is this what you call
keeping an eye on him?

43:57.301 --> 43:59.428
Umm, sort of.

43:59.803 --> 44:01.889
Well, you know you're a grown woman.

44:01.972 --> 44:04.475
I trust you to make wise decisions.

44:06.268 --> 44:08.646
You don't want to tell me
how disappointed you are?

44:08.729 --> 44:10.314
Well, would it do any good?

44:14.902 --> 44:16.195
We're not dating, it...

44:16.654 --> 44:19.865
It's complicated,
and Mr. Brannigan just...

44:19.948 --> 44:21.450
Well, my darling,

44:21.533 --> 44:24.286
we all need to indulge our sweet tooth
every now and again.

44:24.370 --> 44:27.748
But Connor McClane is trouble.

44:30.167 --> 44:32.127
I know you think he is but...

44:33.629 --> 44:36.507
he's actually, not that bad. And...

44:37.925 --> 44:40.928
I promise, there's nothing
going on between us.

44:41.011 --> 44:44.306
Are you trying to
convince me or yourself?

44:49.478 --> 44:51.939
I have to go.
I have to get to Sharl's bakery.

44:52.022 --> 44:54.691
I don't want to be late
for Emily's wedding cake tasting.

44:55.150 --> 44:59.196
OK, well, don't let me dampen
your new found enthusiasm for punctuality.

45:03.242 --> 45:04.827
- OK.
- OK.

45:08.997 --> 45:10.582
Well, well.

45:17.965 --> 45:19.967
Kels, you made it.

45:20.634 --> 45:23.095
Wait until you taste
what Sharl made for us.

45:23.846 --> 45:25.597
Honestly, it's garbage.

45:26.181 --> 45:27.933
I'm just no good around the holidays.

45:28.016 --> 45:30.644
I should be sentenced to fruitcake
for even letting you try it.

45:30.727 --> 45:32.479
Sharl, it's incredible.

45:32.604 --> 45:34.731
Here, try this.

45:38.318 --> 45:40.279
This is honestly the best cake
I've ever tried.

45:40.529 --> 45:43.157
I'm sorry, girls.
I'll find you a new baker.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.616
No, you won't.

45:44.700 --> 45:47.035
I love this and I love you. Thank you.

45:47.536 --> 45:48.745
OK....

45:49.329 --> 45:51.415
I can't watch. I'll leave you two be.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.460
And, please give up on me.

45:55.502 --> 45:59.298
And don't even try the lemon cake
because I used Eureka Lemons like a fool.

46:00.132 --> 46:01.508
What was I thinking?

46:07.097 --> 46:11.018
So, when were you going to
tell me about you and Connor?

46:14.354 --> 46:15.564
Emily, I'm...

46:15.939 --> 46:17.399
I'm so sorry.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.652
For what? I want to hear everything.

46:23.238 --> 46:24.907
You're not mad?

46:24.990 --> 46:26.116
Why would I be mad?

46:26.742 --> 46:28.785
Connor and I dated like 10 years ago.

46:29.328 --> 46:30.621
Yeah, I just...

46:30.954 --> 46:32.539
I thought he left you?

46:32.623 --> 46:34.541
Kels, we were kids.

46:34.917 --> 46:37.920
I mean, I will admit
it was strange seeing him again,

46:38.003 --> 46:40.172
but when I saw him,
I didn't feel anything.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.661
He heard I was getting married
and wanted to wish me well.

46:43.467 --> 46:46.720
So, you're OK with all of this?

46:46.803 --> 46:49.389
Wait, this? There is no this!

46:50.516 --> 46:52.601
I'm about to marry the man of my dreams.

46:52.684 --> 46:55.020
And my best friend
is helping that dream come true.

46:55.896 --> 46:58.023
I'm always behind you, Kels. Always.

47:04.154 --> 47:05.489
This is incredible.

47:06.073 --> 47:07.449
I think I've found the one.

47:08.992 --> 47:11.245
Hey, look, Eureka lemons and everything.

47:11.870 --> 47:13.872
- I'll tell Sharl.
- OK.

48:12.598 --> 48:14.766
There's my crafty PI partner.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.560
- I'm out.
- What?

48:16.643 --> 48:17.853
No, you aren't.

48:17.936 --> 48:19.146
Yeah, this is a mistake, OK?

48:19.229 --> 48:21.773
And don't tell me what I'm doing,
I know what I'm doing.

48:21.857 --> 48:24.043
I don't even know why I agreed to this
in the first place, OK?

48:24.067 --> 48:27.988
I love Emily and I never want to be a part
of something that will ruin her wedding.

48:28.071 --> 48:30.032
Kelsey, come on.

48:30.532 --> 48:32.117
Look, I know you think I'm dumb,

48:32.200 --> 48:34.703
but I can see you're just using me
to get what you want.

48:34.786 --> 48:35.786
Wait.

48:36.204 --> 48:37.581
When did I say you were dumb?

48:38.373 --> 48:39.666
I know you're smart.

48:40.542 --> 48:41.960
That's what I like about you.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.671
And you got the thumb drive.

48:48.342 --> 48:49.342
Come.

48:51.094 --> 48:52.679
OK. Well.

48:52.763 --> 48:55.766
I'm only sitting because I want to.

48:56.350 --> 48:58.602
And because I want to know
what's on the thumb drive.

49:03.523 --> 49:04.816
Did you find anything on it?

49:05.275 --> 49:06.693
- No.
- Oh.

49:06.777 --> 49:08.654
No, turns out they aren't broke.

49:08.862 --> 49:12.574
But that doesn't mean
they aren't up to something no good.

49:14.576 --> 49:15.786
Three days.

49:15.869 --> 49:17.204
You come with me

49:17.287 --> 49:19.498
and we're going to follow
Todd around for three days.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.375
And if nothing comes up...

49:22.626 --> 49:25.420
I'll call off my investigation
and I'll leave town.

49:27.714 --> 49:28.714
Promise?

49:30.342 --> 49:31.677
Scout's honor.

49:32.511 --> 49:33.887
That's not the Scout's sign.

49:33.970 --> 49:35.722
Yeah, that's because I was never a Scout.

49:38.141 --> 49:39.810
What do you say, deal?

49:44.648 --> 49:47.776
Deal. Three days.

49:47.859 --> 49:48.902
Yup.

49:55.325 --> 49:58.412
Well, I happen to know
where Todd's gonna be Wednesday night.

49:59.162 --> 50:00.956
He is having dinner at Turbos.

50:01.540 --> 50:02.708
See.

50:02.791 --> 50:04.334
We make a good team.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.632
OK, well, I'll see you tomorrow.

50:16.430 --> 50:17.907
You know, if you're worried
about him noticing you,

50:17.931 --> 50:19.766
we can always stop
and get you more layers.

50:19.850 --> 50:21.518
Too much?

50:21.601 --> 50:23.270
Nah. Nah.

50:23.353 --> 50:26.231
Not unless you don't want to breathe,
or see, or anything like that.

50:27.607 --> 50:28.650
All right.

50:28.734 --> 50:30.152
This truck is cold.

50:32.112 --> 50:33.280
What?

50:33.822 --> 50:35.949
Whoa, I think we have something.

50:36.032 --> 50:37.409
What's he doing?

50:38.118 --> 50:41.204
He's giving money to charity.

50:41.288 --> 50:42.998
What a jerk.

50:44.791 --> 50:49.212
No, it's probably his guilt
eating him up.

50:50.088 --> 50:51.757
Please.

50:52.591 --> 50:53.591
What?

50:53.633 --> 50:55.886
It's transference. I see it all the time.

50:56.678 --> 50:58.138
Woah, get down!

51:00.807 --> 51:02.559
Come on, we got to follow him.

51:02.642 --> 51:04.519
Be serious. Do your job.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.188
OK, fine, get off me.

51:06.271 --> 51:07.522
OK.

51:12.068 --> 51:15.197
Woah. Woah, woah, woah,
we got something here, check this out.

52:09.709 --> 52:11.169
What!

52:18.552 --> 52:19.886
Hi, guys.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.723
I'm getting a little bit
of a first date vibe here.

52:23.807 --> 52:24.850
Wine?

52:24.933 --> 52:28.061
Oh, no, this is, no, this...
uh, we work together,

52:28.144 --> 52:29.312
but... thank you anyway.

52:29.396 --> 52:31.606
Office romance.

52:31.690 --> 52:33.316
No, not exactly.

52:33.567 --> 52:34.568
Yeah.

52:35.068 --> 52:36.903
We're not allowed to date here either.

52:38.363 --> 52:39.698
Forbidden love.

52:40.156 --> 52:42.826
This calls for a Shiraz.
I'll be right back.

52:53.336 --> 52:55.672
So, it looks like
I'm a pseudo PI.

52:56.214 --> 52:58.258
For what it's worth, I am good at it.

52:58.884 --> 53:01.261
At least that's what
my partner keeps telling me.

53:01.344 --> 53:04.055
Although this case seems like it's a bust.

53:04.514 --> 53:05.514
Tonight's the last night.

53:06.516 --> 53:09.477
I think this will be my first
and last job.

53:10.270 --> 53:12.981
Signing off, Kelsey Gumshoe.

53:13.315 --> 53:16.234
P.S. I gave myself an old school PI name.

53:17.193 --> 53:18.403
Love you muchly.

53:19.487 --> 53:20.989
Love you muchly?

53:23.074 --> 53:25.243
You always read people's texts?

53:25.327 --> 53:27.162
Sorry.

53:27.245 --> 53:29.831
Bad habit I guess, comes with the job.

53:31.291 --> 53:32.751
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

53:34.085 --> 53:35.085
I don't.

53:35.712 --> 53:37.047
I was texting my mom.

53:39.174 --> 53:40.508
I... I shouldn't pry.

53:42.469 --> 53:44.137
She passed away a few years ago.

53:46.306 --> 53:47.557
I'm sorry.

53:50.685 --> 53:52.938
I like to still send her messages.

53:54.522 --> 53:56.232
I even pay her phone bill.

53:58.568 --> 54:00.236
Gee, that must sound really strange.

54:01.655 --> 54:04.699
No, hey, we have to keep the people
we love close.

54:06.701 --> 54:10.997
If that's how she stays with you,
then that's how she stays.

54:12.958 --> 54:14.501
She was...

54:15.001 --> 54:16.711
She was sick for a while.

54:18.630 --> 54:21.800
Aunt Olivia moved us in with her
and helped take care of her.

54:23.969 --> 54:25.345
She was actually pretty great.

54:26.638 --> 54:27.973
And Uncle Albert?

54:29.641 --> 54:31.226
Here we are.

54:31.309 --> 54:32.602
Enjoy.

54:32.686 --> 54:33.770
Thank you.

54:33.853 --> 54:37.941
He wasn't really around a lot,
he was traveling, and...

54:39.109 --> 54:41.295
whenever he was home
I would always hear him and Aunt Olivia

54:41.319 --> 54:42.988
arguing in the other room.

54:44.114 --> 54:46.658
I think he thought of us
as more of a nuisance.

54:46.741 --> 54:48.034
Yeah, sounds like him.

54:52.497 --> 54:53.581
Pffft...

54:53.999 --> 54:56.079
I don't think anyone is showing up.

54:56.626 --> 54:57.877
We hit a dead end.

54:59.337 --> 55:00.380
Yeah.

55:01.214 --> 55:02.799
I think so too.

55:05.510 --> 55:06.845
You want me to drive you home?

55:08.888 --> 55:09.931
Wh...

55:13.810 --> 55:16.021
Here we are. Enjoy.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.320
- OK.
- Wait, wait. What?

55:24.738 --> 55:25.989
What?

55:26.364 --> 55:28.116
You're giving up, seriously?

55:28.199 --> 55:30.869
Don't you have like a Plan B or something?

55:32.037 --> 55:33.538
Well, he's not after her money.

55:34.289 --> 55:35.665
I looked into his work.

55:37.292 --> 55:41.087
I hate to admit it, but,
I think he might be all right.

55:44.841 --> 55:46.718
Just when I was starting to enjoy myself.

55:47.719 --> 55:48.887
A little bit.

55:50.096 --> 55:51.681
Yeah.

55:53.141 --> 55:54.559
That's funny.

55:54.642 --> 55:57.122
You're not the pain in the butt
I thought you were going to be.

55:58.563 --> 55:59.563
Excuse me?

56:01.441 --> 56:04.444
Well, what, trying to buy my scone
with your mystery gift card.

56:04.527 --> 56:06.529
And then stomping over in a huff

56:06.613 --> 56:10.700
demanding I leave the party,
nose all cute and wrinkled.

56:11.284 --> 56:13.203
I didn't demand, OK, I...

56:13.286 --> 56:17.999
Not to mention the Brannigan's party,
where you practically attacked me.

56:18.083 --> 56:21.961
Don't flatter yourself, OK. I was acting.

56:23.379 --> 56:26.674
And you weren't really
a good kisser, so...

56:27.801 --> 56:29.219
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

56:29.511 --> 56:33.098
Well, I mean, I don't wanna,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings but...

56:39.145 --> 56:43.817
Well, what if, what if we try again?

56:45.985 --> 56:47.612
Maybe I can do better?

56:51.950 --> 56:56.579
Well, if you want to try
and redeem yourself, I mean...

56:58.248 --> 57:00.875
Michelle, good to see you.
How was the ride?

57:00.959 --> 57:02.168
- Wh...
- What?

57:02.252 --> 57:03.628
Good.

57:03.711 --> 57:05.463
Here let me get that for you.

57:07.215 --> 57:08.800
Is it still snowing out there?

57:09.801 --> 57:13.763
That's the woman I saw
Todd flirting with at the dress store.

57:14.681 --> 57:16.099
- Really?
- Yup.

57:16.182 --> 57:17.182
Wait.

57:17.892 --> 57:18.994
Is that why you brought me here

57:19.018 --> 57:20.413
because you didn't tell me
about that before?

57:20.437 --> 57:21.312
No, of course I didn't.

57:21.396 --> 57:23.374
You'd think he was like
cheating on her or something.

57:23.398 --> 57:24.482
Exactly.

57:32.115 --> 57:33.992
I am a fierce warrior.

57:34.075 --> 57:36.411
I will tell him
what a no good cheat he is.

57:36.494 --> 57:39.038
I might even throw a drink in his face
for dramatic effect.

57:39.122 --> 57:40.642
Kels, what... what are you doing here?

57:41.040 --> 57:42.333
What are you doing here?

57:42.917 --> 57:44.669
You're engaged to my cousin,

57:44.752 --> 57:47.505
and you're out here
on a romantic dinner date with this...

57:47.589 --> 57:49.466
this... woman.

57:50.216 --> 57:52.427
By the way, I'm not throwing you
anymore business.

57:53.928 --> 57:55.096
Kels.

57:55.638 --> 57:57.056
Did you put her up to this?

57:57.140 --> 58:00.185
Hey, don't look at him, OK?
I saw what you wrote in her book.

58:00.268 --> 58:01.478
You went through my book?

58:01.561 --> 58:04.772
I can't believe
you would do this to Emily, OK?

58:04.856 --> 58:06.649
I'm telling her everything.

58:07.317 --> 58:09.194
I was buying her dress.

58:11.821 --> 58:14.824
Kels, it was suppose to be a surprise.

58:15.492 --> 58:18.411
OK? That's why I stopped by
when you were there.

58:19.704 --> 58:22.165
Michelle and I
have known each other for years, OK?

58:22.248 --> 58:24.751
She set me up with a good deal
with the dress,

58:24.834 --> 58:27.253
so I thought I'd take her out
for dinner to say thank you.

58:30.590 --> 58:31.799
OK.

58:33.343 --> 58:35.303
Her husband actually set this up.

58:36.930 --> 58:38.806
He owns this restaurant.

58:50.151 --> 58:52.612
Come on, let's just go. Come on.

58:53.738 --> 58:55.138
Is this what you do, Connor?

58:56.407 --> 58:58.618
You spend your whole life
trying to ruin Wilson women?

59:02.747 --> 59:04.499
It was an honest mistake.

59:05.875 --> 59:07.919
Kelsey and I
will let you finish your dinner.

59:09.546 --> 59:10.755
I'm sorry.

59:11.965 --> 59:13.007
Come on.

59:13.091 --> 59:15.093
Just walk away, Connor.

59:16.427 --> 59:18.471
I hear that's what you're best at.

59:20.223 --> 59:21.766
Hey. Please.

59:29.941 --> 59:31.651
I really am sorry.

59:57.635 --> 01:00:00.638
Are you trying to ruin your whole life,
or just this job?

01:00:02.473 --> 01:00:04.473
How long did it take you
to come up with that line?

01:00:05.393 --> 01:00:06.936
Well, I had the basic line,

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.100
and then when Sharl came over
he helped me perfect it

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:10.648
when he delivered the cake.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:15.612
So you brought me here
to kick me when I'm down?

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:18.489
No, of course not. I just wanted
to make sure if you were all right.

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:24.537
I'm so embarrassed.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.831
Well, you can't expect yourself
to be perfect.

01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:29.959
Does Emily want to kill me?

01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:33.171
Lucky, I was able to convince Todd
that you were under the spell

01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:36.049
of handsome green eyes
and had no idea what you were doing.

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:39.677
- She doesn't know?
- No. And she's not going to.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:42.555
Todd agreed that we should
keep this between us,

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:45.683
and that we could possibly laugh
about it when we are older.

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.982
He really is a good guy.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:54.359
Well.

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:56.778
I wish you didn't sound
so upset about that.

01:00:57.987 --> 01:01:00.490
It's just... there's...

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:02.533
He's convincing.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:05.370
Who?

01:01:06.287 --> 01:01:07.288
Oh, come on, Kelsey.

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:09.391
I've raised you long enough
to know what your looks mean.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.709
Even if you can't see
you've fallen for him.

01:01:15.713 --> 01:01:17.507
I wish you could see what I see.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.094
I know he's bull-headed,
but he's actually really sweet,

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:24.222
and kind and kinda cute...

01:01:24.972 --> 01:01:26.724
- What is that?
- It's from a check

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:29.143
your Uncle Albert wrote
Christmas Eve 10 years ago.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:31.229
- OK?
- To Connor.

01:01:34.899 --> 01:01:36.442
- Why?
- To buy him off.

01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:38.444
He said if he gave him the money,

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.072
he would go away
and never talk to Emily again.

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:44.659
So Emily woke up Christmas morning
and Connor was gone.

01:01:44.742 --> 01:01:47.412
And Emily's heart was broken.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.001
It doesn't make any sense.

01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:55.765
I mean, that doesn't
sound like him at all.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.338
This is from another check

01:01:57.422 --> 01:02:00.216
that Albert wrote a few months ago
before he passed away.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.468
Connor was facing him again for money.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.137
That's why he's here.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.813
Men.

01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:19.569
Hey. So what do you think Todd
would like best as an apology?

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:22.905
I'm thinking of asking George
to make him a fruit basket.

01:02:25.324 --> 01:02:27.285
Hey, look, I'm, I'm sorry.

01:02:27.368 --> 01:02:30.496
I should have found out who she was
long before I put you in that situation.

01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:38.021
All right, Kelsey, look, I can explain.

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:39.672
- Don't bother.
- I was, just...

01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:44.218
I knew you were using me.

01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:47.430
I'm such a fool.

01:02:48.222 --> 01:02:50.683
- Listen...
- I really felt something for you.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:54.228
And I thought that we had
something special, but I never

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:56.230
want to see you again.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:58.399
- Please, Kelsey, let me explain, OK?
- No.

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.419
You know what the worst thing is,
I don't even hate you.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.779
I hate myself for being so stupid!

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.742
I've spent
the better part of my life

01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:15.810
wishing for a whirlwind romance.

01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:23.317
And now I'll use the remainder...
wishing I hadn't.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.630
I think I'm going to apply
for the serving position.

01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:46.883
Well, you don't have the personality,

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:49.844
or the looks for this fine establishment.
Sorry.

01:04:50.469 --> 01:04:52.263
I don't know what to do, George.

01:04:52.346 --> 01:04:56.434
I didn't just blow this case,
but I dragged Kelsey right down into it.

01:04:56.517 --> 01:04:58.185
Maybe there was nothing to find.

01:04:58.519 --> 01:05:00.688
Yeah, either way she's never
gonna talk to me again.

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:03.983
Well, wasn't that the whole purpose,

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:06.110
I mean, you guys
were just "working together."

01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:09.071
OK, you want me to say it?

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.239
Yeah?

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:14.201
I think she's incredible.

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:16.621
You know,
I... I can't stop thinking about her.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.122
I couldn't even sleep last night

01:05:18.205 --> 01:05:20.085
because I knew
I was gonna see her this morning.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.627
I feel like I'm a kid at Christmas time.

01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:26.005
You're so adorable.

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:29.467
Thanks, I appreciate that but...

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:31.302
if I can't figure out a way to fix this

01:05:31.385 --> 01:05:34.055
I'm gonna be less adorable
and a lot more miserable.

01:05:34.138 --> 01:05:36.432
Well, you already are miserable.

01:05:36.515 --> 01:05:39.518
But listen, I'm here for you.
Anything you need, I got your back.

01:05:39.977 --> 01:05:42.355
Can I give you some advice?

01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:44.065
Just tell her the truth.

01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:47.944
Yeah.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:59.789
I know you taught me
to be strong, and I am.

01:06:00.831 --> 01:06:02.416
Well, I'm trying.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:05.378
If you were here, you'd say,

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.505
"Stupid men lose smart women."

01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:10.424
And then you'd stroke my hair
until I fell asleep.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:12.593
I have a big day tomorrow.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.889
You have no idea how much I miss you.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.558
Love you muchly.

01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:39.787
Here you go.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.206
Thank you.

01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:46.127
OK. Hi, photographer. Hi.

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:48.796
You go to the front
and catch Emily's arrival.

01:06:48.879 --> 01:06:52.258
These, we need more, so just
go get more and put them in the back.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:57.430
OK. No, we need, this has five,
we need six on each, on each thing.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.181
OK, cool, thanks.

01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:00.599
Kelsey.

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:04.311
Hey, everything all right?

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.814
Are you kidding? Look at this place.

01:07:06.897 --> 01:07:08.733
It's like a Christmas dream come true.

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:11.986
What did you do, go through my diary?

01:07:12.903 --> 01:07:16.240
No, I definitely didn't do that.

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:17.575
Of course you didn't.

01:07:24.665 --> 01:07:25.665
Todd.

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.794
Hey. I'll catch up to you.

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:32.757
Look...

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.720
What I did was awful
and I can't say sorry enough,

01:07:37.803 --> 01:07:39.638
and I should have come to you sooner

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:41.575
to say thank you
for not telling Emily, and I...

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:42.600
Kels.

01:07:42.683 --> 01:07:44.852
I just wanted to say
you've done a great job.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.314
It really looks like our dream wedding.

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:49.315
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:50.398
Thank you.

01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:54.236
Thank you, I'm... I'm glad you like it.

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:56.214
I guess I should get going.

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:58.091
Emily said if she sees me
before the ceremony, I'm dead.

01:07:58.115 --> 01:07:59.867
- And I actually believe her.
- OK.

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:03.579
Well, she's a very lucky woman.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.332
I'm the lucky one.

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:07.458
- See you soon.
- Bye.

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:08.541
Bye.

01:08:16.716 --> 01:08:17.843
Hey, George, perfect timing.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:19.553
OK, I just got wind of two more

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:22.515
gluten, dairy,
carb-free dietary restrictions.

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.517
Well, good morning to you too, sunshine.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.680
But that's something
that we won't be worrying about.

01:08:26.852 --> 01:08:29.492
Well, it's certainly nice to hear
your cheery voice in the morning.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:33.317
Well, I heard if you deliver bad news
as positively as possible,

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:34.734
the person takes it better.

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:38.363
How bad, George?

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:39.782
Well...

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:42.743
the freezer malfunctioned overnight bad.

01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:45.830
Please say you're kidding.

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:47.456
You should really swing by.

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:54.773
Hey, do you know anyone we can call,
and is there a way we can make, like,

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:56.799
two hundred pizzas look fancy?

01:08:56.881 --> 01:08:57.966
Please do me a favor.

01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:00.594
Just do not kill me,
because it was actually his idea.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:01.761
And everything is fine.

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:06.517
We actually ordered the food
and I got your non-GMO, the non-dairy,

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.868
and all that kind of nonsense
or whatever.

01:09:07.893 --> 01:09:09.212
- George.
- You want me to go, OK.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.104
Yeah, OK. Good luck.

01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:20.656
So is this what you brought me here for?

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.908
Stand here awkwardly?

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:25.161
Sorry, you just...

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.747
- You look so beautiful.
- Don't, OK. You're not allowed.

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:33.251
You're right.

01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:37.046
OK, look, I,
I just wanted to show you this,

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:40.551
and then, you know, you're free to go.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:43.261
What am I looking at?

01:09:43.804 --> 01:09:45.221
It's the deed to this restaurant.

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.475
George was going to lose this place

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:52.188
and I wanted to help him and his family.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:55.316
So I took what I thought
was a loan from Emily's dad.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:01.739
You seriously expect me to believe that?

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.533
It's the truth.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.079
And then when I went back
to their house that...

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:15.544
He told me never to come back,
or else he'd tell Emily I blackmailed him.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:18.547
Why didn't you just explain it to her?

01:10:21.675 --> 01:10:23.177
Emily loved her dad.

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.346
All that would do...

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:30.309
would be to force her to choose,
and as much as I cared about her,

01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:33.479
I didn't want to destroy a family.

01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:37.233
What about the rest?

01:10:38.525 --> 01:10:39.735
What rest?

01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:42.363
Before my uncle died,
you extorted more money from him.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:46.116
Are you gonna tell me
that was to buy an orphanage or something?

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.160
- Look that was something...
- Hey, you know what?

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:53.332
I really don't have time for this.

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:55.459
And I really don't want
to have time for this.

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:58.504
And I don't want you anymore.

01:10:58.587 --> 01:10:59.588
But, Kel...

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.391
There you are. Where have you been?

01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:12.893
Sorry, I'm late.
Connor tricked me into meeting with him.

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:15.729
That's it. I'm going to sucker punch
that man in the mouth.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:20.109
While I appreciate the support,
it's OK, I took care of it.

01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:22.236
Oh, no.

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:24.071
No, I didn't, didn't punch him.

01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:28.325
I just told him that
I never want to see him again.

01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:32.538
Well, in three hours, my dear,
your job will be done.

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:35.249
And we can drink all the wine
at the reception.

01:11:35.332 --> 01:11:36.458
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.502
Sounds like a solid plan.

01:11:47.511 --> 01:11:48.929
Sorry, we're closed.

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:50.472
Connor, right?

01:11:53.058 --> 01:11:54.310
Sorry, who are you?

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.937
You said I could find you at George's.

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:00.858
Of course.

01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:02.735
Please, after you.

01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:10.951
OK, smile, you two.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.745
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:16.832
Hello. Can I have a moment
with the parents of the groom?

01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:18.959
Why, of course.

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:21.962
I don't normally give interviews,
but since it's Todd's big day...

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:23.505
Well, thank you.

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:26.550
Now I heard that there's gonna be
a surprise musical performance.

01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:28.427
Can you speak to who that might be?

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:34.808
Hello, are you with the bride
or with the groom?

01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:35.976
Hi. Hi.

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:38.771
I don't see a ring on your hand.

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:40.731
May I interest you
in the singles' section?

01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:32.074
Please stand.

01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:59.309
Please be seated.

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:07.276
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today,

01:14:07.734 --> 01:14:10.696
to join Emily and Todd in holy matrimony.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.491
I ask that if anybody here
knows any reason

01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:16.326
they may not be married,

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:19.329
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:27.212
Very well.

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:28.797
Todd Brannigan,

01:14:29.339 --> 01:14:31.842
do you take Emily Wilson
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

01:14:31.925 --> 01:14:33.051
Stop!

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:37.722
Get him out of here.

01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:42.144
Connor, go away.

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:43.979
Emily, he's no good for you.

01:14:44.062 --> 01:14:45.481
What?

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:49.526
Look, if you don't believe me,
believe her.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:59.912
That's enough of this.
Get them out, both of them.

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:01.955
Let him go.

01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:05.310
No, don't listen to her. Get them out.

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:08.212
Honestly, Tim,
this is a little big for you

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:10.964
to try to strong arm your way out of.

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:15.219
Emily, I'm sorry to do this to you.

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:17.221
Don't... Don't, don't listen to him.

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.264
Wait, just stop. Both of you.

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:20.974
- Who is this woman?
- I...

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:23.143
This is Veronica.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:26.438
The Brannigan's former maid.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.652
Tell me this isn't what it looks like.

01:15:31.735 --> 01:15:33.737
I have no idea who that woman is.

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.380
I think a simple blood test
would prove that you do.

01:15:38.575 --> 01:15:42.204
See, Veronica told Todd that he was
gonna be a daddy months ago.

01:15:42.287 --> 01:15:44.957
Instead of buying books
and painting the nursery,

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:49.002
he decided to ignore her
and get married instead.

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:53.840
The Brannigans so generously
kept her employed

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:55.676
through the pregnancy.

01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:58.387
Until they found out who the father was.

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:02.057
And then they did what any good
grandparents would do

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:03.892
and they fired her.

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:06.478
This isn't true. None of this is true.

01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:11.525
Look me in the eye
and tell me this isn't true.

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:13.944
Please.

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.320
Dad?

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:26.456
This is nothing.

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:27.748
What?

01:16:28.041 --> 01:16:29.751
Don't let her ruin us.

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:30.895
- What?
- Hey, hey, hey. Don't throw this...

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:33.714
- No!
- Emily, Emily, Emily...

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:40.553
Emily.

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:48.270
Can't trust anyone these days,
right, Mr. Brannigan?

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:50.688
You're a dead man.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:57.654
If I were you, I would stay focused
on taking care of that baby.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:37.860
Em...

01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:42.240
How stupid am I.

01:17:43.241 --> 01:17:46.078
You're not stupid. At all.

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.287
Honestly.

01:17:48.038 --> 01:17:50.415
You are the best person I know.

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:54.294
How did I not know?

01:17:58.548 --> 01:18:00.258
You did everything right.

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:05.847
I was gonna be married.

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:08.767
I was gonna have kids.

01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:12.396
I was even going to name one Kelsey.

01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:18.026
You can still have all those things, OK?

01:18:18.985 --> 01:18:21.446
Don't let one bad guy
change what you want.

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:32.290
What about you?

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:37.003
What are you going to do about Connor?

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.175
I have no idea.

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:43.969
We should just go to Mexico.

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:46.805
Ditch everyone.

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:49.057
I fully support that idea.

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:52.352
You did such a incredible job
with this wedding.

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:55.856
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, don't you dare apologize, OK?

01:18:56.481 --> 01:18:59.192
You are my sister.
I would do anything for you.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:02.112
Thank you.

01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:09.368
Hi.

01:19:11.955 --> 01:19:12.998
Hey.

01:19:14.332 --> 01:19:16.960
I'm going to leave you two alone to chat.

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:32.267
You'd better have the best
Christmas present ever for her.

01:19:33.518 --> 01:19:34.770
Yes, Emily.

01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:46.490
Your uncle.

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:48.199
What?

01:19:49.576 --> 01:19:50.994
That's who hired me.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:54.623
Emily's Dad. Your Uncle Albert.

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:57.918
That's what the extra money was for.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.463
So you weren't extorting him?

01:20:03.089 --> 01:20:04.089
No.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.636
He called me, near the end.

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.722
He heard from one of his friends
that I was a PI.

01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:16.478
He said that
something didn't feel right about Todd.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:20.607
You might not know this,
but he was a bit of a control freak.

01:20:23.443 --> 01:20:24.861
He hired me to look into Todd.

01:20:25.779 --> 01:20:29.616
He said one dirtbag
would be best at finding another dirtbag.

01:20:31.576 --> 01:20:32.576
I guess he was right?

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.372
You're not a dirtbag.

01:20:36.289 --> 01:20:37.791
Most of the time.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.627
I'm glad you don't think so.

01:20:43.046 --> 01:20:45.090
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

01:20:46.466 --> 01:20:49.177
It's OK. I understand why you didn't.

01:20:53.056 --> 01:20:54.766
Kelsey, I love you.

01:20:58.728 --> 01:21:00.230
What are you doing?

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:02.899
I love you.

01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:05.277
OK, so that's what you're doing?

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.654
You're just gona walk over up to me

01:21:07.737 --> 01:21:10.174
and say, "I love you," and then
everything's gonna be all right

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:11.575
and fixed and perfect?

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:12.951
- No.
- OK, good, because...

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:25.672
We... We...

01:21:26.089 --> 01:21:27.674
We didn't hear a thing.

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:31.845
Connor, I am so sorry
that I misjudged you.

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:33.847
It's OK.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.080
I probably would have done the same.

01:21:39.811 --> 01:21:42.331
Well, this is gonna be
the craziest Christmas in family history.

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:46.693
I've successfully planned
my first and last wedding ever.

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:51.114
It's weird to think when I look back
on this day, it's gonna be

01:21:51.197 --> 01:21:53.867
the best and worst memories, together.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:22:00.373
OK, well, I'm gonna go tell everyone
the Grinch stole the wedding, so...

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:01.917
I'll go.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.753
No, no. I'm supposed to be the one
that's "in charge," so...

01:22:04.836 --> 01:22:07.839
I'm the head of the family.
I'll make the official announcement.

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:10.759
Kels.

01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:13.887
Maybe you can ask them to stay?

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:19.016
Wh...

01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:23.939
What are you doing?

01:22:24.731 --> 01:22:27.233
Well, I'm trying to make
a romantic gesture.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:31.696
Kelsey Wilson...

01:22:33.573 --> 01:22:34.573
will you marry me?

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.496
You can't do this.
We barely know each other?

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:54.928
If you let me...

01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:59.307
I'd like to spend a lifetime fixing that.

01:23:01.768 --> 01:23:03.395
I... I...

01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:05.814
I...

01:23:07.107 --> 01:23:10.110
There are times in our lives
when we simply must take control.

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:12.404
Not give in to silly ideas,

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:15.156
or romantic notions
that love conquers all.

01:23:16.032 --> 01:23:17.617
We have to be grown-ups.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:21.955
All right, shall we try again?

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:23.581
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.168
Do you, Connor McClane,

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:29.754
take Kelsey Wilson
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:31.506
I do.

01:23:32.215 --> 01:23:33.842
And do you, Kelsey Wilson,

01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:37.178
take Connor McClane
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

01:23:37.303 --> 01:23:38.513
I do.

01:23:39.472 --> 01:23:41.558
Then by the power vested in me,

01:23:41.641 --> 01:23:43.601
I pronounce you husband and wife.

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:44.685
Aw!

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:45.728
You may kiss.

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.695
Well, Mom, I did it.

01:23:53.778 --> 01:23:55.321
I planned a wedding.

01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:58.033
And then I hijacked it.

01:23:59.492 --> 01:24:01.494
With blessings of course.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:10.336
I'm not exactly sure where I'm headed,
and that is terrifying.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.756
But I know that wherever I go,

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:15.216
I'll have all the love I need to guide me.

01:24:16.509 --> 01:24:18.803
And I know that love is unconditional.

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:21.097
Love you muchly.

01:24:21.181 --> 01:24:22.223
Kelsey.

01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:32.067
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Mmm-mm.

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.155
Welcome home, Mrs. McClane.

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:50.375
Come on.
