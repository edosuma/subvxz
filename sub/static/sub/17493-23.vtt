Today, Sarah and Duck are
at Beach Top

00:18.240 --> 00:21.840
busy working on their latest
sand sculpture.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.800
So, what's it meant to be?
A jellyfish?

00:25.800 --> 00:29.880
Nope, it's umbrella.
He got stuck in the sand.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.880
Of course!

00:31.880 --> 00:36.760
Oh! Best find some shelter.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.640
QUACK!

02:05.640 --> 02:09.000
I think you have to point where
you want him to go,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.040
before the time runs out.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.840
He needs a sit and think.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.320
Left!

02:19.720 --> 02:21.000
Wha-?

02:22.080 --> 02:26.400
