01:00.000 --> 01:02.968
So you think you can
chug-a-lug, huh?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.367
Uh-huh.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.334
Okay, come on.

01:08.634 --> 01:10.567
And he says, "If I could do it
in my living room,

01:10.601 --> 01:12.634
I wouldn't have to do it
in the back of your cab."

01:12.667 --> 01:15.434
( <i>laughter</i> )

01:15.467 --> 01:19.000
Hey, Tony, this guy wants
to chug-a-lug against you.

01:19.033 --> 01:21.033
Oh, yeah? What's the bet?

01:21.067 --> 01:22.133
Fifty.

01:22.167 --> 01:23.200
Fifty dollars?!

01:23.234 --> 01:24.400
( <i>murmuring</i> )

01:24.434 --> 01:25.567
Hey, we'll all chip in.

01:25.601 --> 01:26.367
Come on, ante up,
you guys.
Ten each?

01:26.400 --> 01:29.033
A pitcher of beer
and two mugs!

01:29.067 --> 01:30.234
Okay, here's my ten.

01:30.267 --> 01:31.367
Alex?

01:31.400 --> 01:32.601
How do you feel, Tony?

01:32.634 --> 01:33.501
Thirsty.

01:33.534 --> 01:35.033
I'm in for ten.
That's good enough for me.

01:35.067 --> 01:36.701
All right.
Here we go.

01:36.734 --> 01:38.901
Okay, we got our bet.

01:38.934 --> 01:40.701
There's my 50.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.033
Excuse me, Alex.

01:42.067 --> 01:43.367
Oh, sure.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.601
So, they say after divorce
your life is empty

01:46.634 --> 01:50.534
and here I am watching
a chug-a-lug contest.

01:50.567 --> 01:53.334
Ready?

01:53.367 --> 01:56.667
One... two... three...
start.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.834
Any time, gentlemen.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.534
Let's get out of here.

02:14.567 --> 02:17.834
I don't want to be around
when he belches.

02:19.334 --> 02:20.901
Oh, come on, let's
forget it-- I'm buying.

02:20.934 --> 02:21.934
Same ol' rounds.
Okay.

02:21.968 --> 02:23.968
What'll you have, John?

02:25.300 --> 02:27.000
John?

02:27.033 --> 02:27.968
Hmm?

02:28.033 --> 02:29.334
What is it?

02:29.367 --> 02:30.834
It's that girl.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.167
ELAINE:
Which one?

02:34.200 --> 02:36.167
You don't have to ask, do you?

02:36.200 --> 02:37.901
No, I guess not.

02:37.934 --> 02:39.467
The blonde.

02:39.501 --> 02:40.968
No.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.934
ELAINE:
The one with
the white blouse?

02:42.968 --> 02:44.267
JOHN:
No.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.067
ELAINE:
Oh, the other one.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.834
See? You picked her out.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.834
It's just that
I've never felt this way before.

02:49.868 --> 02:51.634
I mean, this is the first time

02:51.667 --> 02:54.634
a girl sitting
across from me in a bar

02:54.667 --> 02:56.300
has gotten me all excited.

02:56.334 --> 02:58.300
What do you think, Alex?

02:58.334 --> 02:59.501
I don't think
you have to announce

02:59.534 --> 03:02.000
everything that's
happening in your body.

03:02.033 --> 03:04.133
You like her,
go over and talk to her.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.000
Just like that?

03:05.033 --> 03:05.834
Sure.

03:05.868 --> 03:08.467
What would I say if I did?

03:08.501 --> 03:10.968
Say hello.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.300
No, I couldn't say that.

03:13.334 --> 03:14.634
I mean

03:14.667 --> 03:17.300
I never know what
to say to girls.

03:17.334 --> 03:19.400
I don't know, I just can't seem
to get started.

03:19.434 --> 03:20.767
Ah, just forget it.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.434
Okay.

03:22.467 --> 03:25.801
Okay, I'm going to do you
a big favor

03:25.834 --> 03:28.400
and I hope you appreciate it.

03:28.434 --> 03:30.100
What's the favor?

03:30.133 --> 03:34.834
I'm going to give you
the perfect line.

03:34.868 --> 03:37.067
Works every time, instantly

03:37.100 --> 03:40.100
and with devastating results.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.634
Here's what you do.

03:44.667 --> 03:47.868
You walk up to her,
tap her on the shoulder,

03:47.901 --> 03:51.934
and when she turns around,
you say: "Why waste time?

03:51.968 --> 03:53.934
Let's get married."

03:55.801 --> 03:58.000
I think that
should do it.

03:58.033 --> 04:01.868
It's witty, it's entertaining,
and it's got "married" in it.

04:01.901 --> 04:04.501
( <i>all chuckling</i> )

04:04.534 --> 04:06.133
The line has everything.

04:06.167 --> 04:08.968
Hey, you know,
I got a better one.

04:09.000 --> 04:09.968
What?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.968
You go up and you say:

04:12.000 --> 04:14.367
"Let's cut the
preliminaries--

04:14.400 --> 04:16.367
you want to get married?"

04:16.399 --> 04:18.534
Hey, you know,
that is better.

04:18.567 --> 04:20.300
Shorter anyway.

04:20.334 --> 04:23.834
We just improved
on the wheel, man.

04:25.434 --> 04:27.133
A good line
really helps a lot.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.734
So?

04:28.767 --> 04:29.968
Nah...

04:30.000 --> 04:33.133
John, there's a time when you
either do it or you forget it.

04:33.167 --> 04:34.467
You're absolutely right, Alex.

04:34.501 --> 04:36.000
Let's forget it.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.067
I can't forget it.

04:38.100 --> 04:38.901
BOBBY:
Just do it.

04:38.934 --> 04:39.901
ELAINE:
Just be sweet.

04:39.934 --> 04:41.200
Real nice.

04:41.234 --> 04:42.534
Get it right.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.267
Just smooth. Smooth.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.067
Yes?

05:02.100 --> 05:04.767
Let's cut the preliminaries.

05:04.801 --> 05:07.200
You want to get married?

05:11.567 --> 05:12.934
Sure.

05:12.968 --> 05:14.634
What?!

05:16.267 --> 05:18.801
I was sitting over there and
I wanted to talk to you, and...

05:18.834 --> 05:21.934
I think there's a couple
of places at the bar.

05:21.968 --> 05:23.934
Do you want to take them?

05:23.968 --> 05:25.868
I thought we
were getting married.

05:25.901 --> 05:27.934
Oh, sure, but not right away.

05:27.968 --> 05:29.267
I mean marriage is important.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.267
It can't just be jumped into.

05:31.300 --> 05:33.100
Oh, I agree; yes.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.434
So, we'll get married
in an hour.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.467
Oh, perfect.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.033
Can I buy you that drink now?

05:38.067 --> 05:39.133
Sure.

05:42.234 --> 05:44.234
Author, author.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.467
Preliminaries--
that's the word.

05:54.767 --> 05:57.367
He said, "If I didn't
have to do it...

05:57.400 --> 05:58.601
"If I could do it
in my living room,

05:58.634 --> 06:01.667
I wouldn't have to do it in
the backseat of your cab."

06:01.701 --> 06:04.300
( <i>both laughing</i> )

06:04.334 --> 06:05.801
WOMAN:
I liked that, too.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.834
( <i>laughter continues</i> )

06:10.133 --> 06:13.000
Is it ever going
to happen for me...

06:13.033 --> 06:17.467
or am I just going to spend
the rest of my life alone?

06:20.100 --> 06:24.534
Alone... alone...

06:24.567 --> 06:25.801
alone...

06:25.834 --> 06:28.934
How did I get into this?
All I said was,

06:28.968 --> 06:32.801
"I'm going for a beer.
Does anyone want to come?"

06:32.834 --> 06:34.133
Alone.

06:34.167 --> 06:36.801
When I came over,
did you get the feeling

06:36.834 --> 06:38.467
something special
was gonna happen?

06:38.501 --> 06:40.901
Yeah.
Me, too.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.200
Wait-- before or
after you saw me?

06:43.234 --> 06:46.033
Both, but more after.

06:46.067 --> 06:47.234
Oh, me, too! Me, too.

06:47.267 --> 06:48.300
That's so amazing.

06:48.334 --> 06:51.267
Ah, Suzanne, is this the
best time you've ever had?

06:51.300 --> 06:53.367
Absolutely.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.200
You're not just
saying that, are you?

06:55.234 --> 06:56.901
Or have you really
had a lousy life?

06:56.934 --> 06:59.534
Oh, no.

06:59.567 --> 07:01.534
No, I've had a great life.

07:01.567 --> 07:02.901
And this is your best time?

07:02.934 --> 07:04.400
Yeah.
Wow! Me, too.

07:05.868 --> 07:08.501
Okay, I want you to take
your time with this next one,

07:08.534 --> 07:09.801
'cause it's real
important to me.

07:09.834 --> 07:10.801
Oh.

07:10.834 --> 07:12.367
How do you stand
on bowling?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.767
Feet together,
knees slightly bent.

07:17.801 --> 07:19.334
I use a four...

07:19.367 --> 07:20.601
She bowls.

07:20.634 --> 07:22.868
She bowls!

07:25.000 --> 07:27.167
So what do you
want to do first,

07:27.200 --> 07:29.467
get married,
or go bowling?

07:29.501 --> 07:30.367
Bowling first.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.701
That way, if the
marriage doesn't work,

07:31.734 --> 07:33.234
it won't screw up my game.

07:36.133 --> 07:37.467
Well, so long,
you guys.

07:37.501 --> 07:38.667
We're going to go
get married now.

07:38.701 --> 07:40.000
Oh, that's nice.

07:40.033 --> 07:41.334
Oh-- after bowling.
Good night.

07:41.367 --> 07:42.667
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, good luck.

07:42.701 --> 07:44.000
Good bowling.

07:44.033 --> 07:45.367
We're going bowling?

07:45.400 --> 07:48.434
No, we're not
going bowling.

07:48.467 --> 07:51.834
Would you mind if I joined you
and had a drink?

07:51.868 --> 07:53.400
No. Sit down.

07:58.934 --> 08:00.868
Thank you.
Good night.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.434
LOUIE:
<i>Hey, Wheeler!</i>

08:14.467 --> 08:16.300
Hey, Wheeler,
come over here.

08:16.334 --> 08:17.634
Do I have to?

08:17.667 --> 08:19.934
Yeah.

08:19.968 --> 08:21.567
We got a complaint...

08:21.601 --> 08:24.534
that one of our drivers
got fresh with a passenger.

08:24.567 --> 08:25.734
Was it you?

08:25.767 --> 08:28.934
Of course not.
I don't do that kind of stuff.

08:28.968 --> 08:30.267
Too bad.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.601
I wanted to find out
who it was

08:32.634 --> 08:35.933
so I can give him some tips
from the old expert.

08:35.967 --> 08:38.167
You mean you used to get fresh
with the passengers

08:38.200 --> 08:39.167
when you were a driver?

08:39.200 --> 08:42.267
Only the women.

08:42.299 --> 08:45.000
I used to pull over,
turn around, and ask them

08:45.033 --> 08:49.000
if they'd like to come
to my place for drinks and sex.

08:49.033 --> 08:51.234
Oh, yeah, the subtle approach.

08:51.267 --> 08:53.234
Did it work?

08:53.267 --> 08:53.868
Yeah.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.601
I don't believe you, Louie.

08:55.634 --> 08:57.434
Well, not every time.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.601
Exactly how many times?

08:59.634 --> 09:03.033
Once in 2,312 times.

09:06.701 --> 09:08.334
Oh, hi, John.

09:08.367 --> 09:09.667
Hey, John!
Look who's here.

09:09.701 --> 09:12.701
What have you been doing
the past few days, John?

09:12.734 --> 09:14.434
As if we didn't know.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.367
Hey, stop it!
Come on!

09:17.400 --> 09:19.100
You shouldn't be
doing this.

09:19.133 --> 09:20.767
Why not?
'Cause I could
pulverize you.

09:20.801 --> 09:23.234
Oh, yeah.

09:23.267 --> 09:25.267
I'm sorry.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.868
I'm just kind of sensitive
about what happened.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.200
BOBBY:
Well, what happened?

09:30.234 --> 09:32.434
Remember that girl
I met in the bar?

09:32.467 --> 09:34.267
BOBBY:
Yeah?
I married her.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.601
You what?
Oh, my...!
What?!

09:35.634 --> 09:36.601
How could
you do that?

09:36.634 --> 09:37.934
How could you do
something like that?

09:37.968 --> 09:39.167
John, that was
just a line.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.601
You weren't
supposed to do it.

09:40.634 --> 09:41.901
John, what's the
matter with you?

09:41.934 --> 09:43.300
How could you do
a thing like that?

09:43.334 --> 09:44.701
I don't know.

09:44.734 --> 09:46.701
There we were,
bowling and joking

09:46.734 --> 09:49.601
about whoever lost paid
for the marriage license.

09:49.634 --> 09:51.400
The next thing I knew,

09:51.434 --> 09:54.734
we were eloping to Maryland
in her best friend's Volvo.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.133
John, how...
John, did you think?

09:56.167 --> 09:59.133
Did you say to yourself,
"What am I doing?

09:59.167 --> 10:00.701
This has to stop!"

10:00.734 --> 10:03.701
Yeah. Unfortunately,
I didn't say it to her.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.801
It was like
some game of chicken.

10:05.834 --> 10:08.934
Each one of us thinking
the other would call it off.

10:08.968 --> 10:11.400
I kept thinking she'd brake
any minute

10:11.434 --> 10:15.400
as we drove through New York,
then through Lincoln Tunnel,

10:15.434 --> 10:16.434
then to New Jersey...

10:16.467 --> 10:17.601
John, do me a favor.

10:17.634 --> 10:20.367
Don't say every landmark
from here to Maryland, okay?

10:20.400 --> 10:22.834
It's all so weird!

10:22.868 --> 10:24.400
It was so terrific
being with her

10:24.434 --> 10:26.267
that we were in Maryland
before we knew it.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.267
Yeah, them Volvos
are great.

10:29.300 --> 10:34.767
Anyhow, this morning,
we applied for the
license and...

10:34.801 --> 10:36.234
even bought
a couple of rings.

10:36.267 --> 10:38.601
You know, still treating
the whole thing like a joke,

10:38.634 --> 10:39.968
you know...

10:40.000 --> 10:41.234
and then we had dinner

10:41.267 --> 10:45.634
at this really neat
Maryland McDonalds.

10:45.667 --> 10:46.801
The food's the same

10:46.834 --> 10:49.267
but it's served by people
from Maryland.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.968
Then we checked into this
really nice six-dollar

10:53.000 --> 10:54.501
motel...

10:54.534 --> 10:57.234
Hey, John, I hate
to be indelicate,

10:57.267 --> 10:59.300
but, uh... did you?

10:59.334 --> 11:00.901
Oh, no, no.

11:00.934 --> 11:02.901
We were too excited
for that.

11:02.934 --> 11:06.667
Anyhow, this morning,
we picked up the license,

11:06.701 --> 11:08.467
and found the Justice
of the Peace--

11:08.501 --> 11:11.234
even then, I still felt
we'd never go through with it.

11:11.267 --> 11:13.567
When the Justice
of the Peace said,

11:13.601 --> 11:16.801
"Do you take this man
to be your husband?"

11:16.834 --> 11:19.801
I was sure that we'd both
laugh like crazy,

11:19.834 --> 11:23.067
or she'd say no,
but she didn't.

11:23.100 --> 11:27.534
She said, "I will if he will."

11:27.567 --> 11:28.934
The Justice of the Peace
asked me

11:28.968 --> 11:30.601
if I'd take her as my wife.

11:30.634 --> 11:33.167
I said no!

11:33.200 --> 11:35.734
But somehow it came out yes!

11:38.534 --> 11:40.834
And just like that,
we were married.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.167
I mean, married.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.834
I mean, right away, we both knew

11:43.868 --> 11:45.534
it was the biggest mistake
of our lives.

11:45.567 --> 11:48.100
All the way back,
we only said three words.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.634
She said, "Need gas?"

11:49.667 --> 11:52.367
I said, "Yes."

11:54.634 --> 11:55.801
When we got back to town,

11:55.834 --> 12:00.067
I let her off at my apart--
<i>our</i> apartment...

12:00.100 --> 12:00.901
and there she sits,

12:00.934 --> 12:04.767
the woman Maryland
considers my wife.

12:10.968 --> 12:13.501
I'm married!

12:13.534 --> 12:15.000
I really am!

12:15.033 --> 12:17.367
Alex, what am I
going to do?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.701
I'm half crazy.

12:18.734 --> 12:20.367
A conservative estimate.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.701
Just relax.

12:21.734 --> 12:24.734
I know it looks very bad
right now,

12:24.767 --> 12:26.267
but somehow we're going
to figure out a way...

12:26.300 --> 12:28.901
Oh, Burns...

12:28.934 --> 12:32.834
you decided to grace us
with your presence.

12:32.868 --> 12:35.467
Well, listen here--

12:35.501 --> 12:38.934
the next time you don't show
up for work for two days,

12:38.968 --> 12:39.834
you're fired.

12:39.868 --> 12:42.100
Hey, hey, Louie,
the kid just got married.

12:42.133 --> 12:45.100
Don't yell at him.

12:45.133 --> 12:46.801
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:50.033 --> 12:55.000
( <i>sweetly</i> ):
The next time you don't
show up for work for two days,

12:55.033 --> 12:56.467
you're fired.

13:08.901 --> 13:12.467
John, you got
to go home sometime.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.067
I can't.
She's there.

13:15.100 --> 13:18.334
Mrs. Me.

13:20.434 --> 13:22.701
I don't want to be married,
Alex.

13:22.734 --> 13:24.067
I don't know--

13:24.100 --> 13:27.467
it sounds crazy, but in my mind,
it's all connected.

13:27.501 --> 13:31.200
You get married, you have kids,
you grow old, and then you die.

13:31.234 --> 13:32.467
Somehow, to me,

13:32.501 --> 13:36.100
if you didn't get married,
you wouldn't die.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.234
Hey, Fitz, how you doing?

13:41.267 --> 13:42.534
Ellen... Rudy!

13:42.567 --> 13:43.601
Hey, how you doin'?

13:43.634 --> 13:45.567
Hey, Champ,
how's it going?

13:45.601 --> 13:46.901
Fine.

13:46.934 --> 13:49.100
You want to risk your title
against me?

13:49.133 --> 13:50.367
How much?

13:50.400 --> 13:53.634
Let's see here...

13:53.667 --> 13:55.367
How about 20 bucks?

13:55.400 --> 13:57.100
You're on.

13:57.133 --> 13:59.300
All right.

13:59.334 --> 14:01.100
Two beers, Rudy.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.334
( <i>panting</i> )

14:02.367 --> 14:03.701
Hey, Louie.

14:03.734 --> 14:06.100
You still owe me money
on your tab.

14:06.133 --> 14:08.133
Oh, yeah, yeah, all right.

14:08.167 --> 14:11.734
Well, come by the garage this
week and I'll give you a tire.

14:14.834 --> 14:16.133
Let's go.

14:16.167 --> 14:17.133
All right, now...

14:17.167 --> 14:19.801
I'll say, "one-two-three, go."

14:19.834 --> 14:20.801
All right?

14:20.834 --> 14:21.968
Sure.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.133
One...

14:23.167 --> 14:24.400
two...

14:24.434 --> 14:25.467
three.

14:25.501 --> 14:26.767
Hey, Rudy, did they find

14:26.801 --> 14:29.801
the rest of that rat
that died in the beer keg?

14:29.834 --> 14:30.834
Go.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.534
The new champeen.

14:42.868 --> 14:46.200
Better luck next time,
Champ.

14:49.534 --> 14:51.000
Excuse me.

14:51.033 --> 14:53.167
Is this the
wedding party?

14:53.200 --> 14:54.834
Louie!

14:54.868 --> 14:57.767
Louie, I never thought I'd say
this, but would you join us?

14:57.801 --> 14:59.033
No, thank you.

14:59.067 --> 15:03.767
John, the little woman
came by the garage tonight.

15:03.801 --> 15:06.300
She left a letter for you.

15:06.334 --> 15:07.467
Well, let's have it.

15:07.501 --> 15:09.801
For a buck.

15:09.834 --> 15:12.434
Hey, the post office
only charges 15 cents.

15:12.467 --> 15:15.801
Yeah, and they're going broke.

15:15.834 --> 15:17.133
Thank you.

15:17.167 --> 15:21.300
Not bad-- I've been here
two minutes, had a beer,
and won $21.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.467
Bye-bye.

15:23.501 --> 15:27.801
Oh, by the way,
should I change your W-2 now,

15:27.834 --> 15:31.701
or do you want to see
if you have kids by tonight?

15:40.501 --> 15:42.467
We didn't
order drinks.

15:42.501 --> 15:43.868
It's on the house.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.834
You know, I got a "Dear John"
once.

15:45.868 --> 15:48.033
Oh, that isn't what this is.

15:50.701 --> 15:52.133
"Dear John..."

15:57.868 --> 16:00.100
You want me to read the letter?

16:00.133 --> 16:01.100
Would you?

16:01.133 --> 16:02.634
"Dear John,

16:02.667 --> 16:05.734
"I'm leaving you this letter
because I'm ashamed to face you.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.868
"I hate to think
of what you think of a girl

16:07.901 --> 16:10.701
"who runs off and
marries a total stranger.

16:10.734 --> 16:12.734
"I don't know why

16:12.767 --> 16:13.868
"I do crazy things

16:13.901 --> 16:16.133
"but I do know you're too nice
a guy

16:16.167 --> 16:18.767
"to be stuck
with an immature nut like me.

16:18.801 --> 16:21.734
Naturally, we'll have
the marriage annulled..."

16:21.767 --> 16:23.467
Oh.
Oh.

16:23.501 --> 16:27.601
"Looking back, it seems
like some bizarre dream.

16:27.634 --> 16:29.100
"Any minute,

16:29.133 --> 16:31.901
"I kept expecting
you would wake me up

16:31.934 --> 16:34.133
"but you didn't and I didn't.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.534
"So we did.

16:35.567 --> 16:39.334
"We sure did.

16:39.367 --> 16:42.200
"Right away, I knew it was
a terrible mistake

16:42.234 --> 16:43.934
"and I sensed you did, too.

16:43.968 --> 16:47.267
"I've decided to move back
with my folks for awhile,

16:47.300 --> 16:49.267
"try and get my head together.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.067
"I hope what happened
wasn't too hard on you.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.334
"I'm sure someday

16:53.367 --> 16:56.300
"you'll meet someone
you really want to marry

16:56.334 --> 16:58.400
"and whoever she is,
I envy her.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.100
"Anyway, thanks
for a special weekend.

17:01.133 --> 17:02.767
"I'll never forget it.

17:02.801 --> 17:04.800
Or you."

17:04.834 --> 17:07.634
And it's signed,
"Your future ex-wife, Suzanne."

17:10.133 --> 17:11.601
It's a nice letter.

17:11.634 --> 17:13.634
I read it nicely.

17:18.968 --> 17:21.567
And now, it looks like
your problems are solved, kid.

17:21.601 --> 17:23.634
Yeah.

17:23.666 --> 17:24.934
You know, Alex,

17:24.968 --> 17:27.934
that's the classiest letter
I ever heard.

17:27.968 --> 17:30.801
Open, honest, sensitive.

17:30.834 --> 17:32.968
Just like she is.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.634
I got to get her back.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.033
Help me get her back.

17:37.067 --> 17:40.167
I never wanted anybody back
so bad in my life.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.567
Why do I come here so often?

17:43.601 --> 17:45.534
I almost never have a good time.

17:55.567 --> 17:56.901
( <i>buzzer sounds</i> )

18:02.901 --> 18:04.400
Yes?

18:04.434 --> 18:05.634
Mr. Caruthers?

18:05.667 --> 18:06.968
Yes.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.801
We're the ones who phoned you.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.033
On the phone.

18:10.067 --> 18:13.200
I've been wondering
what that was all about.

18:13.234 --> 18:14.968
Um, can we come in?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.567
I guess so.

18:17.601 --> 18:20.033
I think you'll have to open the
door a little more than that.

18:20.067 --> 18:23.234
I'm sorry, but how do I know
I can trust you?

18:23.267 --> 18:24.267
Come here.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.534
Look at him.

18:25.567 --> 18:26.868
Hi.

18:26.901 --> 18:28.367
Okay.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.467
Now, what's this
all about?

18:36.501 --> 18:38.868
Mr. Caruthers,
my name is John Burns

18:38.901 --> 18:41.167
and this is my friend,
Alex Rieger.

18:42.467 --> 18:45.801
Alex will take over from here.

18:45.834 --> 18:49.200
Oh, Mr. Caruthers, um,
has your daughter told you?

18:49.234 --> 18:50.334
Told me about what?

18:50.367 --> 18:51.767
I guess she hasn't told you.

18:51.801 --> 18:54.000
If you tell me what it is
you want to know

18:54.033 --> 18:55.267
whether or not she has told me

18:55.300 --> 18:57.601
then I'll tell you
whether or not she has told me.

18:57.634 --> 19:00.934
I can tell
she hasn't told you.

19:00.968 --> 19:02.100
WOMAN:
Oh, Mark, I...

19:02.133 --> 19:03.200
Oh, Lillian,

19:03.234 --> 19:04.734
this is Mr. Burns.
Rieger.

19:04.767 --> 19:06.734
And this is Mr. Rieger.
Burns.

19:06.767 --> 19:08.434
This is my wife, Mrs...
Caruthers.

19:08.467 --> 19:09.434
Yes.

19:09.467 --> 19:10.434
How are you?

19:10.467 --> 19:12.033
LILLIAN:
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.934
They're friends of Suzanne.

19:13.968 --> 19:16.100
Oh, yes, well,
Suzanne's in her room.

19:16.133 --> 19:18.767
Oh, could you tell her that
I'm here and maybe I love her?

19:18.801 --> 19:20.133
Sit down.

19:20.167 --> 19:22.367
First, I want to know
what's going on.

19:24.801 --> 19:26.434
Mr. Caruthers...

19:26.467 --> 19:29.434
Mr. Caruthers, do you
like to hear things
with the lily gilded,

19:29.467 --> 19:31.267
or straight
between the eyes?

19:31.300 --> 19:33.133
Gilded.

19:33.167 --> 19:37.033
You see, we've always tried
to instill in our daughter

19:37.067 --> 19:41.067
the good grace to conceal
virtually everything from us.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.467
She hasn't told
you anything?

19:43.501 --> 19:47.801
Not since 1971.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.067
Well, Mr. and
Mrs. Caruthers,

19:49.100 --> 19:49.801
I think you better
brace yourself,

19:49.834 --> 19:51.534
because what I have
to tell you...

19:51.567 --> 19:52.534
Someone come in?

19:52.567 --> 19:54.000
I heard the...

19:54.033 --> 19:55.501
Oh, John.

19:55.534 --> 19:56.767
Suzanne.

19:56.801 --> 19:57.567
Hold it.

19:57.601 --> 19:58.734
Sit down.

19:58.767 --> 20:01.133
This man is about
to tell us something.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.267
Well, go on, sir.
We're listening.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.067
Oh, uh, yes, um...

20:05.100 --> 20:07.067
You sure you don't
want it straight?

20:07.100 --> 20:08.067
Absolutely.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.067
Right.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.968
Okay, now,
let's see, um...

20:12.000 --> 20:13.367
( <i>clears throat</i> )

20:13.400 --> 20:15.100
Well, how's this:
do you believe

20:15.133 --> 20:16.634
in love at first sight?

20:16.667 --> 20:19.567
I believe the notion
of love at first sight

20:19.601 --> 20:23.634
is a debasement of every moral,
spiritual, and ethical value

20:23.667 --> 20:25.868
that I and my family hold dear.

20:30.868 --> 20:33.501
This is no snap.

20:33.534 --> 20:35.000
Well, I have to give it
to you straight then.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.367
This is what happened:

20:36.400 --> 20:38.000
Three nights ago,
John met your daughter in a bar,

20:38.033 --> 20:39.267
they fell in love,

20:39.300 --> 20:40.801
and after looking at each other
countless times,

20:40.834 --> 20:42.434
drove to Maryland
and got married.

20:43.501 --> 20:46.334
You were in a bar?

20:50.567 --> 20:53.200
Mark, don't you
understand?

20:53.234 --> 20:55.667
Our daughter is married.

20:55.701 --> 20:58.534
And this man
is our son.

20:58.567 --> 21:00.167
But they're going
to get divorced.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.567
Oh.

21:01.601 --> 21:03.334
But John wants
to stay married.
Oh.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.000
But your daughter
wants to get an annulment.

21:05.033 --> 21:07.334
Is this fun for you?

21:10.334 --> 21:12.534
Well, once you get into it.

21:12.567 --> 21:15.834
No, listen...
look, now that we all know,

21:15.868 --> 21:18.834
why don't we all just leave
them alone together,

21:18.868 --> 21:20.300
so they could, uh...

21:20.334 --> 21:25.067
Or we could stay
and stare at each other.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.501
That's not such a bad idea.

21:27.534 --> 21:32.367
I think I've spent too much time
ducking things like this.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.834
Maybe the time has come
to forget my fears

21:34.868 --> 21:37.501
and pay attention
to my daughter.

21:37.534 --> 21:40.434
Yes, this is it.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.033
The time has come
to stay with her

21:43.067 --> 21:45.167
and face this
thing head-on.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.167
Mr. Rieger?

21:46.200 --> 21:47.200
Right.

21:59.834 --> 22:03.767
Suzanne, when we were in
that motel room in Maryland...

22:03.801 --> 22:06.701
Hup, that's it!

22:06.734 --> 22:07.767
Let's go, Lillian.

22:09.167 --> 22:10.133
Mr. Rieger.

22:10.167 --> 22:11.467
Right.

22:11.501 --> 22:14.167
Take your time, John.
Don't worry about me.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.100
I'll be having fun
standing in the kitchenette

22:16.133 --> 22:17.367
with Mr. and
Mrs. Caruthers.

22:21.834 --> 22:23.968
You want to stay married?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.334
I do.

22:26.834 --> 22:29.834
I figured you'd never want
to see me again.

22:29.868 --> 22:33.167
Oh... Look, Suzanne,
what happened

22:33.200 --> 22:35.667
was just as much my
fault as it was yours.

22:35.701 --> 22:37.033
You know, I think
that's what

22:37.067 --> 22:38.234
brought us
both together.

22:38.267 --> 22:39.534
We're both crazy.

22:41.367 --> 22:43.767
I just think that,
for some reason,

22:43.801 --> 22:46.868
we had the instinct
to be with each other.

22:46.901 --> 22:49.367
Now, I know it
doesn't make sense,

22:49.400 --> 22:51.434
'cause we hardly
know each other,

22:51.467 --> 22:54.634
but right now, I'd
rather follow my instinct

22:54.667 --> 22:56.133
and not make sense.

22:59.534 --> 23:04.567
Suzanne, will you not
get annulled with me?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.033
No.

23:07.067 --> 23:09.033
Oh, that's terrific.

23:09.067 --> 23:10.133
No! Wait a minute!

23:10.167 --> 23:11.133
No what?

23:11.167 --> 23:13.367
No, I won't get annulled.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.934
I can't believe it.

23:14.968 --> 23:16.200
She said, "no."

23:16.234 --> 23:17.467
Oh, oh.

23:17.501 --> 23:21.200
Oh, boy, you better be
as nice as you seem.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.367
I am.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.834
Hey, let's call
your folks.

23:24.868 --> 23:25.968
Oh, Dad, Mom!

23:26.000 --> 23:26.968
Alex!

23:27.000 --> 23:28.334
What's wrong?

23:29.901 --> 23:32.567
Mr. and Mrs. Caruthers,

23:32.601 --> 23:35.067
I'd like your permission
to marry my wife.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.601
Hey, man, you
got rid of her.

23:49.634 --> 23:50.601
That's great.

23:50.634 --> 23:52.000
No, we're staying married.

23:52.033 --> 23:54.234
Congratulations,
she's a wonderful girl.

24:00.534 --> 24:03.367

24:27.534 --> 24:29.100
WOMAN:
Night, Mr. Walters.
