WEBVTT

00:11.428 --> 00:12.804
The probe hit us pretty badly.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.847
Repairs are gonna take
a little while longer.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.099
We don't have much time.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.767
There's no telling
when the Empire will get here.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.394
We've got to get off the surface.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.479
Well, the Empire's
not our only problem.

00:21.647 --> 00:23.314
There's a storm coming up behind us.

00:23.399 --> 00:25.400
lf the Empire gets here
before we take off,

00:25.484 --> 00:27.360
the storm will be
the least of our problems.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.113
Here they are,
the coordinates of every Republic base,

00:30.197 --> 00:34.784
Separatist installation, pirate hideout
and smuggler's den in the Outer Rim.

00:34.952 --> 00:39.205
Plus a few Mandalorian bases
that even they've forgotten about.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.958
Thank you, Captain.
Sure you won't come with us?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.918
Yeah, you're not bad in a fight.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.045
I mean, for older gentlemen.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.924
Yeah. Like I said, our war's over, kid.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.260
Don't much care
to get mixed up in another.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.679
And say hello
to Commander Tano for me.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.057
But the Empire's on its way,
and they will find you.

00:58.142 --> 01:00.226
We can take care of ourselves.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.936
Spectre-1 to Spectre-2.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.108
Gonna be down here a while longer.
Give me some good news.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.735
Has the Empire showed up yet?

01:09.069 --> 01:11.195
I'm a little busy
finishing repairs on the Ghost,

01:11.280 --> 01:13.656
but Chopper's been scanning.
So far, nothing.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.332
Just had to say that.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.382
Star Destroyer
just came out of hyperspace.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.468
Gonna power down
so they can't scan me.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.720
Once I finish my repairs,
I'll come get you.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.430
Good luck down there.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.933
Sorry, buddy. That means you too.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.537
lf they follow procedure,
they'll fly search patterns

02:01.622 --> 02:03.456
based on our last confirmed position.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.957
Or they'll call.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.126
Incoming Imperial transmission.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.128
It's for you, Wolffe.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.338
They called back?

02:11.006 --> 02:12.381
They, they never call back.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.301
This is why I don't trust clones.

02:15.886 --> 02:19.180
-Just get rid of 'em, Wolffe.
-Yeah, it was my mistake.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.224
And I'll fix it.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.061
CC-3636.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.022
Commander Wolffe, is it?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.650
Yep, that's me.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.151
What can I do for you, sir?

02:32.486 --> 02:33.820
Please transmit your coordinates

02:33.904 --> 02:36.989
so I can investigate the Jedi sightings
you reported.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.200
What? Jedi?

02:39.326 --> 02:42.578
No, no. No... There's no Jedi.

02:43.080 --> 02:47.917
Here. My old cybernetic eye
must be acting up again.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.669
Sorry for wasting your time.

02:49.753 --> 02:53.005
This image was taken
by one of our probe droids.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.801
It clearly shows you
harboring known rebels.

02:57.261 --> 03:00.763
Now surrender them or be destroyed.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.140
lf it's a fight you want,

03:03.392 --> 03:07.687
I hope you brought a better class of
soldier than those stormtroopers.

03:07.813 --> 03:10.147
They serve the Empire well,

03:10.232 --> 03:13.025
and I have a great many of them.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.111
You're gonna need all of 'em.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.656
I like these guys.

03:20.576 --> 03:21.868
They found us.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.536
Guess that search pattern paid off.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.705
Battle stations.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.922
We're sitting mynocks on this thing!

03:35.132 --> 03:37.884
Think so? Wolffe, evasive maneuvers.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.802
Copy that.

03:45.517 --> 03:48.144
Hurry!
He's coming around for another pass.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.650
Ezra, protect the Phantom.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.985
What about the walker?

03:56.111 --> 03:58.070
It can take a hit, I think.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.625
Try shortening your leads.
You're wasting ammo.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.668
You're welcome to help.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.634
Why spoil the fun?
We haven't been shot at in years.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.595
Yeah? Well, it happens to us every day.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.181
Why doesn't someone man
the big gun?

04:25.515 --> 04:27.141
That's no good in this situation.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.935
Kinda like you guys.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.103
You want the shot?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.356
Love to.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.459
Gregor, you've still got it.

04:53.669 --> 04:54.961
It's in my blood.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.631
You know, we'd make a good team
if we all fought together.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.551
Yeah, tried that once.
Didn't work out so well.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.971
Now if that storm gets any closer,
it'll ground us.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.181
Sabine, we need the Phantom to fly.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.724
I'm on it.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.271
We have their location.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.148
Shall we commence
orbital bombardment?

05:17.901 --> 05:20.736
No. Prepare for ground assault.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.749
Sorry. I'm in your seat.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.877
The traverse controls
are over here on the left,

05:37.004 --> 05:39.255
and the elevation's on the right.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.923
Really?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.013
So,

05:47.097 --> 05:49.223
what was it like to fight
in the Clone War?

05:49.558 --> 05:52.184
I don't think the fighting
ever got to Lothal.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.520
I tell ya, war was never dull.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.941
The general I fought with
was among the greatest of the Jedi.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.403
I trusted him with my life
more times than I can count.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.073
And I tried my best to keep that trust.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.910
All right. With any luck,
we can get outta here soon.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.621
We can't just leave Rex,
Wolffe and Gregor here.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.207
Well, the Empire is here because of us.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.126
We'll deal with the consequences.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.129
Wait. Listen.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.214
You hear that?

06:24.259 --> 06:26.802
Enemy contact .24.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.403
How many legs they got?

06:44.613 --> 06:46.822
-Looks like four.
-Four?

06:47.282 --> 06:48.657
Well, how are they not falling over?

06:48.784 --> 06:51.285
Will you look at the size
of those things?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.913
Reinforced armor plating,

06:53.997 --> 06:57.041
heavy cannons
and antipersonnel blasters.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.418
I'm glad you guys are so excited,

06:59.503 --> 07:02.838
but those giant death machines
are on their way to blow us to bits!

07:04.508 --> 07:06.550
Wolffe, set vector two-niner-zero.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.805
Wait, you're just gonna turn and run?
Just like that?

07:11.181 --> 07:14.183
Well, if you've got a better idea, sir,
now's the time.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.935
I thought you clones loved to fight.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.771
I do love a battle, but on my terms.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.357
Gregor, drop the joopa.
We gotta get moving.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.194
Bye-bye, Big Bongo.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.534
Wolffe, turn 180.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.993
Copy that.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.710
They're turning tail,
but they can't outrun us.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.796
-Fire at will.
-Yes, sir.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.849
Kanan. I'm not sure how far we'll get,
but I think she'll fly.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.184
Good enough for me.
Zeb, we're going now.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.520
Too late.
The walkers are already on top of us.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.730
He's right, Kanan.
They'll shoot us down.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.567
How will going into that storm
be any better?

08:04.734 --> 08:07.736
Well, the storm will scramble
the scanners. We'll all be blind.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.405
But a Jedi won't.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.909
All right, everybody inside.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.913
Sir, yes, sir.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.672
Sir, we're losing them in the storm.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.426
No, you are losing them
by slowing down.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.344
Full speed ahead.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.688
That's it. I can't wait any longer.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.446
Quiet. Quiet. They're right above us.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.489
They must have finished
their initial scan,

08:52.616 --> 08:54.116
but I don't want to take any chances.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.870
Keep your power on low, and help me
put this panel back together.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.456
Really?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.458
You won't be working
much slower than you normally do.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.302
We're not gonna be able to hide
in this storm forever.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.888
Those things are practically
impervious to blasters,

09:15.972 --> 09:19.225
but they have one weak point
in their armor, the neck.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.645
One well-placed shot
from the main gun should destroy it.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.648
That's all we might get, one shot.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.403
Scopes are dead, sir.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.323
They think because we're blind,
they have a chance.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.159
Now we prove them wrong.

09:37.285 --> 09:40.120
All units, 30 degrees left, flanking turn.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.676
I don't know how we're supposed to
shoot something we can't see.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.011
I don't even know where the enemy is.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.348
You don't always have to see
something to know where it is.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.351
lf you're willing to trust me,
I can get us that shot.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.937
I always trust my general.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.375
Prepare to stop. Now!

10:48.982 --> 10:51.525
We should have found them by now.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.569
Pincer maneuver.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.367
Commander Wolffe,
circle left, double time.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.834
Full stop!

11:13.173 --> 11:15.424
lf what I'm sensing is right,
we're surrounded.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.508
What?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.102
I know they're here.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.855
What's your next move, clone?

11:33.902 --> 11:38.113
You put us right in the middle of 'em
to get us a shot.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.450
It's crazy,
but it's probably our best chance.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.744
Once we fire, we'll reveal our location.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.913
lf we miss, it's all over.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.956
I'll take the shot.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.125
No, Ezra should take the shot.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.877
Why don't you do it?

11:51.961 --> 11:55.381
Kanan's right. We need one Jedi up
there manning the cannon...

11:55.465 --> 11:58.133
And another Jedi down here
to lead us out of this mess.

11:58.426 --> 12:02.054
You are the only ones
who can see in this storm.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.643
Sabine, spot him.

12:10.772 --> 12:11.939
Hey, kid.

12:14.609 --> 12:15.901
You might need that.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.986
And hang on tight.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.665
I gotcha! I gotcha! Come on!

12:34.963 --> 12:36.338
Don't miss.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.507
Hey, I never miss.

12:48.852 --> 12:52.688
Ezra, there's a walker
somewhere around .5.

12:52.856 --> 12:56.024
Somewhere around .5? Terrific.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.281
Targeting scope's useless.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.199
I can't see it.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.536
It doesn't matter. You're not
going to see it with your eyes.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.372
The walker is there. Trust yourself.

13:43.865 --> 13:46.158
-Got 'em.
-Wolffe, there's your opening.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.409
Go for it!

13:50.079 --> 13:51.747
Focus fire on the energy burst.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.257
Has there been any word
from Agent Kallus?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.427
No, sir. All communication and tracking

14:05.512 --> 14:07.596
was lost when they entered the storm.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.557
Admiral Konstantine, we have
an urgent transmission coming in.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.185
Not now.
We're in the middle of an operation.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.021
Sir, the message is from Lord Vader.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.524
We've been ordered to immediately
rendezvous with his shuttle.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.909
Hang on, hang on.
Something's happening.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.958
This is either really good or really bad.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.545
You would think "bad."

14:39.629 --> 14:41.630
Have you finished
the last of the repairs?

14:42.549 --> 14:43.799
Well, get on it.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.473
Great shot, kid.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.892
Now get yourself moving.
This is your only chance.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.811
What? We can't leave now.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.147
We have to get the information they
gave us back to the rebellion.

15:02.485 --> 15:05.320
The other part of that mission
is to bring Rex back with us.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.905
We can't just abandon them.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.825
You're not abandoning anyone.
We're covering your escape.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.451
Now, move.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.673
We're soldiers, Ezra.
This is what we were born to do.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.316
Wolffe, bring us around.

15:48.698 --> 15:52.534
The rebel ship is escaping,
but Konstantine will deal with them.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.871
Let's teach these clones
just how obsolete they are.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.873
Boys, this might be it.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.542
At least we'll go down
fighting like a clone should.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.544
I'm with you all the way, Captain.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.313
Kanan, you know better than anyone.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.900
They won't give up.
This fight is gonna be their last.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.244
Come on, Wolffe. It's just a scratch.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.956
Keep moving forward, soldier! Onward!

16:48.800 --> 16:50.717
Intensify forward firepower.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.728
I'm going for the legs, all four of them.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.565
They've lost their minds!

17:14.701 --> 17:16.284
We've been outflanked.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.510
It's too bad about Captain Rex,

17:33.594 --> 17:35.303
but at least you got the intel.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.889
-I'll rendezvous with you shortly.
-Copy that.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.891
What are we gonna tell Ahsoka?

17:39.976 --> 17:42.853
Rex was her friend,
even though he was a clone.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.648
I hate it when he's right.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.484
I've got my problems with clones,

17:49.736 --> 17:51.486
but I don't want those men to die.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.160
Gregor, I've lost power
to the main cannon!

17:58.411 --> 18:01.163
I know, I know. I'm working on it,
Captain. I'm working on it!

18:02.665 --> 18:04.833
Come out and fight, you cowards!

18:05.334 --> 18:06.668
Finish them.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.851
Just like the old days.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.689
What was that?

18:29.525 --> 18:30.859
Roomy.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.410
Where's Konstantine
with my air support?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.502
Power restored.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.682
Evacuate! Get to the speeders!

19:26.415 --> 19:28.583
Looks like we live to fight another day.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.168
Don't we always?

19:30.253 --> 19:32.921
Well, we do when we've
got a Jedi leading us.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.625
Inquisitor, I thought Lord Vader
was coming aboard.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.210
I wasn't aware that you...

20:12.295 --> 20:15.797
Lord Vader has sent me in his place.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.799
Well, this unnecessary diversion

20:17.884 --> 20:21.052
may have compromised
the success of Agent Kallus's mission.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.972
-We must return.
-I care not for your struggles.

20:24.473 --> 20:28.310
I will succeed where you
and Kallus have failed.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.957
Commander.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.712
You got old.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.007
Had to happen sometime, Rex.

21:08.351 --> 21:09.768
I'm glad you're still alive.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.021
You too.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.316
Well, I wouldn't be
if it weren't for these guys.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.028
Thank you for trusting my friend.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.571
It wasn't easy.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.199
It's still not.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.868
Nothing worth doing ever is.
