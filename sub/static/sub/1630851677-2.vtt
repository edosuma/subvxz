right there, Sam.
That's serious.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.109
Aaron Donald did 35.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.111
Yeah, well,
Aaron Donald's a freak.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.200

02:38.549 --> 02:40.203

Hitting a man center mass
at 1,200 meters

02:43.206 --> 02:45.948
is not the sort of skill
that the U.S. military

02:45.991 --> 02:47.558
wants many people to have.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.430
I thought
Charlton Heston was dead.

02:49.473 --> 02:50.779
You should be humbled

02:50.822 --> 02:52.781
that you had that training,
Agent Blye.

Yeah, Sam.

03:13.367 --> 03:16.457
Lieutenant Junior Grade
Craig Tanaka

03:16.500 --> 03:19.111
was beaten

yesterday at Dockweiler Beach.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.203

03:23.246 --> 03:25.030
That is yet to be determined.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.598
He's being prepped
for his second surgery.

03:27.642 --> 03:30.079
At his age
with injuries like this,

03:30.122 --> 03:31.385
it is not looking good.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.952
How old is he?KILBRIDE:
73 years old.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.216
Lieutenant JG Tanaka

03:36.259 --> 03:38.914
served aboard
the destroyer USS Walke

03:38.957 --> 03:40.524
during the Vietnam War.

03:40.568 --> 03:43.527
So somebody beat up a
73-year-old Vietnam War veteran.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.137
Who does that?

03:45.181 --> 03:47.488
Someone that's about
to be hunted down by us.

03:47.531 --> 03:50.099
Well, Callen's in Napa.
He'll be back in a few hours.

03:50.142 --> 03:54.190
Lieutenant Tanaka's son
is an LAPD RHD detective.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.149
I'm having him
sent over to the boatshed.

03:57.193 --> 04:00.196
Sam, Fatima will meet you there.Copy that.

hit the crime scene.

04:04.548 --> 04:07.072

04:10.554 --> 04:13.122
Sitrep.Uh, yes, sir.

04:13.165 --> 04:17.039
Uh, Tanaka's still in surgery,
but our guy is a fighter.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.997
When the EMTs
were cleaning out their wagon,

04:19.041 --> 04:20.260
they found this
bloody fish knife

04:20.303 --> 04:21.870
engraved with
Tanaka's name.

04:21.913 --> 04:25.352
The blood is human
but not Tanaka's.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.354
He stuck 'em.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.007
Looks that way, sir.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.315
Well, I'd say the bastard
got more fight

04:32.359 --> 04:35.884
than he was bargaining for
going after this lieutenant.

04:45.415 --> 04:48.984
I'm so sick of the hate
on the streets right now.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.681
Well, we don't know
it was a hate crime.

04:50.725 --> 04:53.336
We don't know much of
anything yet. Want a water?

04:53.380 --> 04:54.903
Yeah, sure.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.165
I mean, it fits
the recent patterns

04:56.208 --> 04:57.514
of Asian American beatings.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.821
And they target
women, the elderly.

04:59.864 --> 05:02.171
They sucker punch
them from behind.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.216
I mean, hitting
an old person?

05:04.260 --> 05:06.480
And then beating them
after they hit the ground?

05:06.523 --> 05:08.612
That is pure hate.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.571
[exhales]Mm.

05:10.614 --> 05:11.963
Well,

05:12.007 --> 05:14.357
you started off
not wearing a hijab.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.446
Then you found religion.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.927
Now you're a young woman
living in L.A.,

05:18.970 --> 05:20.407
and you wear one.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.843
It's a big transition.

05:21.886 --> 05:24.541
[sighs]
That's an understatement.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.064
You know, growing up in L.A.,

05:26.108 --> 05:27.588
I never really felt
like an outsider.

05:27.631 --> 05:30.025
And contrary
to what 90210tells you,

05:30.068 --> 05:31.722
there are a lot of Persians

05:31.766 --> 05:33.115
at Beverly Hills High.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.204
But in the last few years
wearing the hijab...

05:35.247 --> 05:36.945
I don't know, I've had

05:36.988 --> 05:38.555
some really awful things
yelled at me.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.341
But I've never experienced
violence like Lieutenant Tanaka.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.343
Well, it starts off
with words.

05:43.386 --> 05:46.346
Then they become more brazen.
Then words turn into violence.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.217
So, you do think
this was a hate crime?

05:48.260 --> 05:50.567
A good agent doesn't allow
their personal views

05:50.611 --> 05:54.005
to steer the direction of a case
before the evidence comes in.Yeah.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.791
You've had
certain specific experiences.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.619
They've shaped
your frame of reference.

05:58.662 --> 06:01.535
Your gut instincts
could be valuable in this case,

06:01.578 --> 06:04.102
so don't ignore them.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.277
Hmm?

06:08.324 --> 06:09.847
You know, it's a
little out the way,

06:09.891 --> 06:12.459
but I was thinking maybe we
stop at La Perla Tapatia.

06:12.502 --> 06:15.636
Grab some carne
asada for the grill.

06:15.679 --> 06:18.421
Sure, whatever you want.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.902
Or maybe after that
we go to Petrossian

06:20.945 --> 06:23.818
for a small tin
of Baika caviar.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.124
Yeah, that sounds good.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.562
Who knows, maybe
finish off the night

06:28.605 --> 06:30.651
with a nightcap
of illicit drugs.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.479
Okay.[sighs]

06:32.522 --> 06:34.394
Look, I know you're mad.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.048
What?

06:37.092 --> 06:39.486
Because I'm mad, too.

06:39.529 --> 06:42.750
Oh, no. No, I'm not mad.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.360
I mean, don't get me wrong,

06:44.404 --> 06:47.015
I'm so pissed, but more
than anything, I'm just...

06:47.058 --> 06:51.236
sad. I'm just deeply sad.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.936
I know. Me, too.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.373
A 73-year-old Vietnam vet

06:57.417 --> 06:59.680
was literally fighting
for his life

06:59.723 --> 07:01.899
in a parking lot
in America.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.119
Like, how does that happen

07:04.162 --> 07:07.557
in the most powerful,
greatest country in the world?

07:07.601 --> 07:09.429
Um...

07:09.472 --> 07:11.779
Fr-Frustration.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.824
Anger.

07:13.868 --> 07:16.261
Fear. Hate.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.614
You know, I don't know
if I told you this,

07:20.657 --> 07:23.225
but after I quit being a lawyer,
I bought this van.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.836
And I lived in it
for six months.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.142
I went everywhere.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.710
And I loved
every single mile of it

07:29.753 --> 07:30.972
because I love this country.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.800
I love the ocean
and the mountains

07:32.843 --> 07:34.584
and the canyons
and these big cities

07:34.628 --> 07:37.326
and small towns, but the thing
that I love the most

07:37.369 --> 07:41.069
was all these amazing people
that I met everywhere.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.419
Americans.Yeah, Americans. Exactly.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.768
But then I have to reconcile
with the fact

07:44.812 --> 07:47.945
that this happened in America.
On our soil.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.295
That a man that fought
for this country

07:50.339 --> 07:52.863
was beaten to the ground
because of the color of his skin

07:52.907 --> 07:54.996
and where his ancestors
are from.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.346
[sighs]
We're better than this.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.870
I mean, we have
to be better than this,

07:59.914 --> 08:02.960
'cause this is not the country
that I know and love.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.970
Enter.

08:14.276 --> 08:16.104
Sir, Lieutenant Tanaka's
out of surgery,

08:16.147 --> 08:19.063
but we don't have an update
on his current condition yet.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.630
Got it.

08:26.114 --> 08:27.985
There something else?Yes, sir.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.117
Well...

08:29.160 --> 08:32.642
I wanted to know, um...

08:34.165 --> 08:35.602
[chuckles softly]
Well...

08:35.645 --> 08:37.908
You practicing a TikTok
or asking a question?

08:37.952 --> 08:39.606
[chuckles softly]
No, sir.

08:39.649 --> 08:42.260
I wanted to know why
the Office of Special Projects

08:42.304 --> 08:43.740
got assigned this case.

08:45.002 --> 08:48.049
I could tell you
that Lieutenant JG Tanaka

08:48.092 --> 08:50.791
was a well-respected
volunteer docent

08:50.834 --> 08:53.489
at the National
Submarine Memorial, West.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.536
But that's not
why we got assigned this case.

08:57.319 --> 08:59.495
No, it isn't.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.672
I requested this
directly from SECNAV

09:02.716 --> 09:05.806
because it might be
a hate crime directed

09:05.849 --> 09:08.809
against a Japanese American
naval veteran.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.332
Okay.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.468
Sit.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.954
I grew up in Oregon,

09:23.998 --> 09:27.741
and my best friend
was a guy named Ralph Sakamoto.

09:27.784 --> 09:30.047
Lived next door.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.745
And every Sunday,

09:31.788 --> 09:34.835
Ralph's family would cook us
these huge meals.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.358
Every Sunday.

09:36.401 --> 09:40.580
And one day, I asked my mom
why they did that.

09:41.711 --> 09:46.194
And she told me that back
when the U.S. government

09:46.237 --> 09:48.805
imprisoned
all the Japanese Americans

09:48.849 --> 09:50.981
back during World War II,

09:51.025 --> 09:53.854
that people started to loot

09:53.897 --> 09:55.725
and vandalize
their empty homes.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.118
Damn, that's messed-up.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.120
That's what my dad thought.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.557
And he told Mom that nobody,

10:01.601 --> 10:05.343
nobody was gonna touch
the Sakamotos' home

10:05.387 --> 10:07.215
while they were locked up.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.696
But, sure as hell,
looters trying to steal

10:09.739 --> 10:13.525
and racists just full of hate
tried that house.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.049
My old man

10:15.092 --> 10:18.226
sat on the front porch
with one shotgun across his lap

10:18.269 --> 10:20.532
and another one at his side.

10:20.576 --> 10:23.405
And he sat on that porch
every night after work

10:23.448 --> 10:27.670
for two years
till the Sakamotos were freed.

10:31.761 --> 10:35.112
Sounds like your father
was an incredible man.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.116
That he was.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.250
And what kind of a son
would I be

10:42.293 --> 10:43.773
if I didn't track down
the son of a bitch

10:43.817 --> 10:46.689
that did this
to Lieutenant Tanaka?

10:48.691 --> 10:50.780
Yes, sir.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.305
That is all.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.704
[door opens]

11:03.227 --> 11:04.446
Hey, guys.

11:04.489 --> 11:07.754
This is LAPD RHD
Detective Jack Tanaka.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.756
Thanks for bringing
him down, Castor. Hi.No problem.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.888
Special Agent Hanna.
Special Agent Namazi.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.934
[door opens]So sorry that this happened.

11:13.977 --> 11:16.327
[door closes]Our thoughts are with you
and your family.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.895
Thank you.Please, have a seat.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.467
So, uh,

11:25.510 --> 11:27.295
we appreciate you taking
the time to speak with us.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.600
We know
you'd much rather be out there

11:28.644 --> 11:29.645
on the street
finding these people.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.299
No, I don't want to do that.

11:31.342 --> 11:34.084
If I want the men
that beat my father prosecuted,

11:34.128 --> 11:36.217
I can't be
anywhere near this case.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.741
Wow, you have
incredible restraint.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.569
Yeah, well,
people, uh, friends of ours,

11:40.612 --> 11:42.919
they would use words
to describe Dad

11:42.963 --> 11:45.226
like "kind, funny, loving."

11:45.269 --> 11:48.620
Only word I would ever use
to describe him is "discipline."

11:50.535 --> 11:52.450
I respect your father
even more now.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.888
Yeah. Well,
if my lack of discipline

11:54.931 --> 11:56.498
let whoever beat him
off the hook,

11:56.541 --> 11:58.674
my old man
would never forgive me.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.371
We understand you can't be
involved in the case,

12:00.415 --> 12:02.678
but can't just turn off 15 years

12:02.722 --> 12:04.332
of detective experience,
so you have anything

12:04.375 --> 12:05.725
that could help us
find these people?

12:05.768 --> 12:07.335
I mean, my-my father's
a creature of habit.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.640
Every day was the same.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.120
Uh, he worked out hard
in his backyard,

12:10.164 --> 12:12.688
volunteered at the Naval Weapons
Station Seal Beach,

12:12.732 --> 12:14.951
then cast a few lines
surf fishing at night.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.605
On weekends, he and his buddies,

12:16.648 --> 12:18.868
they would drink beers
in Dad's garage.

12:21.088 --> 12:23.133
Man, I'm at a loss.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.048
I got no idea who'd want
to hurt him.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.704
Do you think
this was a random attack?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.401
Random as far as him
being Asian American?

12:30.445 --> 12:32.447
Wrong time, wrong place?

12:32.490 --> 12:35.755
I think this was
a racially motivated hate crime.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.539
But you don't have
any evidence of that?

12:37.582 --> 12:39.280
With all due respect,

12:39.323 --> 12:41.325
finding that evidence
is your job.

12:51.205 --> 12:54.425
So, Rountree said there are
no security cameras positioned

12:54.469 --> 12:56.079
at where Lieutenant Tanaka
was attacked.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.602
And based on the injuries,

12:57.646 --> 12:59.343
there's no way to tell
what the initial blow was.

12:59.387 --> 13:00.605
[scoffs]
Well,

13:00.649 --> 13:02.390
considering the recent
Asian American attacks,

13:02.433 --> 13:04.218
I'm gonna say it was
a cowardly sucker punch

13:04.261 --> 13:05.219
or kick to the back.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.829
It's crazy.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.526
This beach that time of day
would have been blown out,

13:08.570 --> 13:09.919
so you got no surfers.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.486
Too windy and cold to
lay out and get a tan.

13:11.529 --> 13:12.879
I mean, it would have
been empty here.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.532
In that case,
I think it's safe to say

13:14.576 --> 13:15.838
that they didn't follow him up
from the beach

13:15.882 --> 13:17.579
because he would have
spotted them.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.886
Meaning they had to have come
from the parking lot.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.105
So, maybe they saw him
when he was fishing,

13:22.149 --> 13:23.672
knew the parking lot was empty,

13:23.715 --> 13:25.761
made their move when
he walked to his truck.Hmm.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.371
Know what's crazy about this?

13:27.415 --> 13:28.895
In this massive city
with all these people,

13:28.938 --> 13:31.419
in this parking lot
at that time of day,

13:31.462 --> 13:34.639
he might as well be fighting for
his life in the Sahara Desert.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.206
ROUNTREE:
Hey, guys?

13:36.250 --> 13:38.339
L.A. Sheriffs just got a call
into their tip hotline

13:38.382 --> 13:39.819
from a woman who heard

13:39.862 --> 13:41.429
about the attack on the news.
She was jogging

13:41.472 --> 13:43.083
down at Dockweiler Beach
yesterday at sundown.

13:43.126 --> 13:46.173
Please, tell us she saw
Lieutenant Tanaka at his truck.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.697
We need a firm time
of the attack.ROUNTREE: No.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.917
It's better. Two guys
in dark jeans and hoodies

13:50.960 --> 13:53.093
came running up the hill
from the parking lot

13:53.136 --> 13:54.442
towards Vista Del Mar.

13:54.485 --> 13:55.660
She remembered thinking
how odd it was

13:55.704 --> 13:57.053
these guys
were running in jeans.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.141
SAM:
Two of them.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.882
Cowards.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.102
Did she see
if they went to a parked car?

14:02.145 --> 14:04.452
No. She just kept on jogging,
never saw them again.

14:04.495 --> 14:07.498
All right, get this info down
to Kensi and Deeks at the beach.Copy that.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.109
[phone vibrates]

14:09.152 --> 14:10.501
Oh, I just got this

14:10.545 --> 14:12.286
from the Naval Weapons
Station Seal Beach.

14:12.329 --> 14:13.940
The C.O. is in New York

14:13.983 --> 14:16.899
but wants to speak to us
about Lieutenant Tanaka.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.596
The C.O., huh?

14:18.640 --> 14:22.296
Safe to say not many C.O.s even
know their volunteer docents.

14:22.339 --> 14:23.775
Hmm.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.647
[phone vibrates]What do you got?

14:25.690 --> 14:26.822
Oh.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.607
Uh, Rountree says
a witness saw two guys

14:29.651 --> 14:31.653
running up that hill.

14:31.696 --> 14:34.656
DEEKS:
Where'd they go
after they hit the street?

14:34.699 --> 14:36.136
I don't know.
She didn't see.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.789
Well, then, we should
probably run up that hill.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.183
Shall we?Why do I need
to run up the hill?

14:40.227 --> 14:41.924
[scoffs]Okay.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.144
Just saying, running is silly
'cause you're a sucker!

14:44.187 --> 14:47.147
Oh, my God. You're the world's
biggest fifth grader!

14:47.190 --> 14:49.453
That's very helpful
information, Captain.

14:49.497 --> 14:50.846
Thank you
for speaking with us.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.153
Of course.
And if I wasn't traveling,

14:53.196 --> 14:54.937
I'd be there in person.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.722
Lieutenant Tanaka
is someone that all of us

14:57.766 --> 15:00.943
at Naval Weapons Station
Seal Beach hold in high regard.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.163
If you don't mind me asking,
as C.O. of the base,

15:03.206 --> 15:06.731
how did you become familiar
with a volunteer docent?

15:06.775 --> 15:09.038
That may be Lieutenant Tanaka's
official title with us,

15:09.082 --> 15:13.173
but that man is a
very important part of my base.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.479
He takes his volunteer duties
more seriously

15:15.523 --> 15:18.526
than many of my commissioned
naval officers take theirs.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.963
Rain or shine, he is with us.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.182
What are his duties?

15:22.225 --> 15:24.140
He maintains the bright work
and plaques

15:24.184 --> 15:26.012
on the World War II
Submarine Memorial

15:26.055 --> 15:28.928
and guides wildlife
viewing groups on the base.

15:28.971 --> 15:33.193
But really, he is a wealth
of knowledge and inspiration

15:33.236 --> 15:36.022
to every sailor and officer
on that base,

15:36.065 --> 15:38.676
including myself.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.157
Please find the people
responsible for his attack.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.073
Yes, sir.

15:44.117 --> 15:46.162
[monitor beeping steadily]

16:01.743 --> 16:04.093
Well, no enemies or
conflicts at the naval base.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.617
It's looking more and more
like a random attack.Yeah.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.880
ROUNTREE:
Hey, Sam, Fatima.
Couple different things.

16:08.924 --> 16:11.666
Lieutenant Tanaka's doctor said
that the surgery went as well

16:11.709 --> 16:12.928
as it could.Has he regained
consciousness?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.451
No. It's gonna be a waiting game

16:14.495 --> 16:15.583
to see if he pulls through.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.106
What's the other thing?

16:17.150 --> 16:19.456
I just got Lieutenant Tanaka's
banking information.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.763
Checking account shows that
he's been getting a paycheck

16:21.806 --> 16:24.984
from an LLC every week
for the past three months.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.246
He has a job?

16:26.289 --> 16:28.161
Yeah. Contacted the LLC.
Said he's been doing

16:28.204 --> 16:30.250
part-time carpentry work
on some of their properties.

16:30.293 --> 16:32.165
How many properties
has he worked at?ROUNTREE: Three.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.862
But for the past
two and a half weeks,

16:33.905 --> 16:36.125
he's been working
on one restaurant renovation.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.997
She mentioned
the job's been delayed

16:38.040 --> 16:40.042
because someone threw a brick
through the window.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.437
All right. Fatima and I
will check it out.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.656
Actually,
Callen is 20 minutes away.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.007
Uh, Admiral Kilbride
wants you to meet Callen

16:48.050 --> 16:50.139
at the restaurant.
Fatima, report back to Ops.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.315
You got it.ROUNTREE: Just sent
the address to your phone, Sam.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.666
It's a perfect view of the
parking lot and Tanaka's truck.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.973
The attackers could have
been hanging out up here,

16:58.017 --> 17:00.932
saw Tanaka alone
in his truck, moved in.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.934
Yeah.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.284
Maybe.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.763
What?
What are you thinking?

17:05.807 --> 17:08.288
Well, it's just
that if they did park up here,

17:08.331 --> 17:09.854
it would make
for a pretty easy getaway.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.205
I mean, that-that access
ramp hits the main road.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.989
High speed limit, and
if they head north,

17:14.033 --> 17:15.643
they got two
different freeways.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.645
Wait, so you think
the attack was premeditated?

17:17.688 --> 17:19.908
I don't know.
But if they did,

17:19.951 --> 17:21.301
it wouldn't be a bad
idea to park up here

17:21.344 --> 17:22.737
considering the fast exit.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.478
So, maybe they saw him
someplace else

17:24.521 --> 17:25.783
and followed him here.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.744
Yeah.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.226
[door unlocks]

17:33.269 --> 17:35.532
Thank you.
Sure.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.928
This neighborhood
sure has changed.

17:39.971 --> 17:40.929
Can you believe
what they're getting

17:40.972 --> 17:42.061
for rents around here now?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.063
Yeah, it's crazy.
I don't know

17:44.106 --> 17:46.326
how they expect the young people
to save up for a down payment

17:46.369 --> 17:47.762
with rents like this.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.112
The rent to square footage ratio
is just...

17:50.156 --> 17:51.896
Don't need a full discussion
on rental economics.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.855
I was merely making
an observation.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.336
So, there was no way
you and Anna

17:56.379 --> 17:58.120
could have stayed in Napa
for another week?[chuckles]

17:58.164 --> 17:59.426
I tell you,

17:59.469 --> 18:00.992
this Lieutenant Tanaka's
an artist.

18:01.036 --> 18:03.517
Not a lot of people using
these type of tools anymore.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.780
Takes too much time,
too much care.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.521
When did you become
a carpentry aficionado?

18:07.564 --> 18:09.262
One of the foster
homes I was in.

18:09.305 --> 18:10.611
Woman was an alcoholic.

18:10.654 --> 18:11.960
Horrible person when she drank.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.744
But her husband
was a great guy.

18:13.788 --> 18:16.138
He turned their garage
into a woodshop

18:16.182 --> 18:18.053
and used to make
custom cabinetry,

18:18.097 --> 18:19.707
nightstands, that
sort of thing.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.491
So, I'd hang out and watch.

18:21.535 --> 18:24.059
So, let me guess. He took you
under his wing, and a rival,

18:24.103 --> 18:27.106
a bully carpentry club,
challenged you to a build-off.

18:27.149 --> 18:30.805
[chuckles] At the all-valley
carpentry tournament.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.287
You know, you can just admit
that you missed me.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.636
You don't have to lash out

18:35.679 --> 18:36.680
'cause you feel
like I abandoned you.

18:36.724 --> 18:37.768
You abandoned me?

18:37.812 --> 18:38.856
Yeah.Cuckoo.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.510
You're crazy.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.773
Mm-hmm.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.519
SAM:
G.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.782
Check this out.

18:53.567 --> 18:56.961
Fresh paint.Yeah, and there's
something under it.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.441
It's faint,
but I can see it.Yeah, looks like

18:58.485 --> 19:00.226
they were trying to cover
up something that was

19:00.269 --> 19:02.576
in red. And they were
gonna do another coat.

19:02.619 --> 19:03.968
Well, company said

19:04.012 --> 19:05.579
somebody threw a brick
through the window.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.537
Maybe they came in and
vandalized the inside, as well.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.626
Let's see
what they painted over.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.889
FATIMA:
Hey, Kens. I just got word

19:11.933 --> 19:13.674
from Jack Tanaka
at the hospital.

19:13.717 --> 19:16.024
It turns out he didn't know
about his dad's carpentry job,

19:16.067 --> 19:18.200
but it didn't surprise him.
His dad has taken

19:18.244 --> 19:20.115
jobs like that
through the years.KENSI: Okay.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.812
And do we have an update on
Lieutenant Tanaka's condition?

19:21.856 --> 19:23.510
He still hasn't
regained consciousness,

19:23.553 --> 19:25.773
but the doctors have seen some
positive signs in his vitals.

19:25.816 --> 19:28.036
All right. Well,
keep us posted.

19:28.079 --> 19:31.257
Will do.What an awful spot
for Jack Tanaka to be in.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.954
You're sitting there
by your dad's side,

19:32.997 --> 19:34.695
and there is nothing
you can do to help him.

19:34.738 --> 19:38.786
Yeah. I think that he
knows he's by his side.Right.

19:38.829 --> 19:41.919
You know, I-I know that...

19:41.963 --> 19:45.184
we said that we were
open to, um...

19:46.402 --> 19:48.099
I guess my-my point is

19:48.143 --> 19:50.928
that I don't think
we put the proper thought in...

19:50.972 --> 19:53.627
I mean, we haven't even begun
to have the conversation.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.368
It's more of a discussion...What, about the fact
of being open

19:55.411 --> 19:57.239
to raising a child
outside of our race?

19:57.283 --> 19:58.893
See, there it is. Right there.
I'm trying to be delicate,

19:58.936 --> 20:00.590
and you just stumble
right through it

20:00.634 --> 20:01.939
like a big old drunk elephant.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.724
Drunk elephant?A big old drunk elephant.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.160
Excuse me.
[chuckles]

20:05.204 --> 20:07.554
I'm serious.Yeah, no. I know.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.208
I've been feeling the same way,

20:09.251 --> 20:11.166
and I do think that this is
something we need to talk about.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.213
[chuckles]: I mean, I
didn't even think twice

20:14.256 --> 20:15.953
when we filled
out those forms.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.738
I would love to raise a child
no matter what race,

20:17.781 --> 20:20.915
but I... yeah,
there's-there's obstacles

20:20.958 --> 20:22.395
that we need to talk about.Right.

20:22.438 --> 20:24.919
Like, how do we educate
a child about a race

20:24.962 --> 20:26.660
and a culture
that we're not a part of

20:26.703 --> 20:29.010
and obviously have
no expertise in?

20:29.053 --> 20:30.838
Like, how do we do that?I don't know yet.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.013
I don't know.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.667
Uh-huh.But I do know

20:33.710 --> 20:35.495
that we can't avoid
or neglect it.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.888
You know, we can't pretend that
the child's race and culture

20:37.932 --> 20:39.455
aren't a massive
part of who they are

20:39.499 --> 20:41.414
and-and why we love them.

20:41.457 --> 20:42.893
Of course.You know?

20:42.937 --> 20:47.028
But also how the
world perceives them.

20:47.071 --> 20:48.856
Uh-huh.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.988
I mean, so, we're...

20:51.032 --> 20:53.426
offering what, then?

20:53.469 --> 20:55.210
We offer a safe home.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.691
Yeah.And a means
to an education.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.301
Yeah.We offer and promise

20:59.345 --> 21:01.347
to raise them with love.Of course.

21:01.390 --> 21:02.913
Nothing would
break my heart more

21:02.957 --> 21:04.263
if they never felt
like they fit in with us

21:04.306 --> 21:06.221
or anyone else
who looked like them.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.223
Lots to consider.Yeah.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.746
I'm gonna need
some more caffeine

21:09.790 --> 21:11.705

Ready?

21:13.315 --> 21:14.447
Yep.

21:31.464 --> 21:33.640

Of course. Happy to help.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.207

21:40.821 --> 21:42.301
about the racial slurs
on the wall.

21:42.344 --> 21:45.129
He kept it to himself,
repainted.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.306
I had Rountree
check it out.

Didn't see nothing.

You don't even know
what I was gonna ask you.

Don't matter.
My answer would be the same.

So, you didn't see
the diner across the street

22:14.637 --> 22:16.247
get vandalized
a couple of nights ago?

I don't know nothing.

is it cool for people to come in

22:26.867 --> 22:28.564
and paint racial
slurs on walls?

22:28.608 --> 22:30.218
Hell no.

Oh, man.

Tanaka's gonna be pissed
when he sees that.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.447
You know Lieutenant Tanaka?

22:41.490 --> 22:43.884
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,
he's a good dude.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.146
Funny as hell, too.

22:45.189 --> 22:46.408
He'll be here any minute.

22:46.452 --> 22:47.844
You can talk to him
about the diner.

Lieutenant Tanaka's
in the hospital.

22:50.717 --> 22:53.807
What?SAM:
He was assaulted yesterday.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.591
Is it bad?

22:55.635 --> 22:57.985
Yeah. It's real bad.Damn.

23:00.683 --> 23:01.989
his attackers
may be the same people

23:11.259 --> 23:13.783
I found this across the street
in the bushes yesterday.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.395
Might be the same can
they used in the diner.

Can you imagine

23:31.279 --> 23:33.107
what must have been going
through Lieutenant Tanaka's mind

23:33.150 --> 23:35.370
when he saw that crap
spray-painted in the diner?

23:35.414 --> 23:38.242
After serving this country
as a Vietnam veteran.

23:38.286 --> 23:41.724
I... [exhales] I know
he was just boiling.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.465
You know, wanted
retribution.

23:43.509 --> 23:46.729
But instead he just painted
over it and went about his job.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.949
Probably didn't want to
risk rocking the boat

23:48.992 --> 23:51.081

23:51.125 --> 23:53.606
You know, a few weeks back,
this ignorant dude

23:53.649 --> 23:56.260
yelled some racist stuff at me
in North Hollywood.

23:56.304 --> 23:58.741
It took everything
for me to just walk away.

23:58.785 --> 24:01.396
[sighs]Yeah. It was only really

24:01.440 --> 24:04.051
two moments in life that I
felt like race didn't matter.

24:04.094 --> 24:05.835

were one family

this is a hate crime.

racial slurs from the diner

24:35.430 --> 24:36.910
to the attackers.We do that,

24:36.953 --> 24:38.520
we prove it wasn't
a random attack.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.261
Lieutenant was targeted.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.568
Okay, but if he was targeted
for renovating the diner,

24:42.611 --> 24:44.091
why would they attack
him at the beach?

24:44.134 --> 24:45.658

Well, maybe Tanaka knew

24:45.701 --> 24:48.225

for those racial slurs,

and he confronted him.

is who he lives with.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.368
Yeah, his roommate's
a guy named Billy Strauss,

25:00.411 --> 25:02.283
whose family was
the longtime owner of the diner

25:02.326 --> 25:04.372
that Lieutenant Tanaka
was renovating.

25:04.415 --> 25:06.287
So, the Strauss family,
they lose the business.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.245
They get angry.
They get frustrated.

Then they go after the...CALLEN:
Wrong guy.

25:09.899 --> 25:12.119
Tanaka isn't the buyer. He's not
the one forcing them out.

He's not even capitalizing

25:15.688 --> 25:17.559

decide to beat him up.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.996
Which is why they decided
to beat him up at the beach

25:20.040 --> 25:22.695
and not the, uh, diner, because
if they do it at the diner,

25:22.738 --> 25:25.001
that's a pretty direct line of
investigation back to Strauss.

25:25.045 --> 25:27.961

28:37.628 --> 28:38.934
So, you painted racial slurs

28:38.978 --> 28:40.675
on the walls
that Tanaka was renovating,

28:40.719 --> 28:42.372
but you want us to believe
you are not

28:42.416 --> 28:43.765
one of the two people
that attacked him?

28:43.809 --> 28:44.897
I was there.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.159
I spray-painted.

28:46.202 --> 28:47.595
I messed up the new walls,

28:47.638 --> 28:49.249
but I didn't write those words.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.468
You didn't write those words,
but Strauss painted those words?

28:51.512 --> 28:53.340
Strauss did?Yeah. But you guys said

28:53.383 --> 28:54.515
two guys beat up the old man.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.343
It was only Billy.

28:56.386 --> 28:58.824
He never mentioned
anyone else being there.

29:00.086 --> 29:01.696
SAM:
So, it was Billy Strauss

29:01.740 --> 29:04.481
at the beach
and an unknown accomplice.CALLEN: Yep.

29:04.525 --> 29:06.483
Well, whoever came here
for Strauss,

29:06.527 --> 29:07.746
they knew what they were doing.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.225
They got in the house
quick enough

29:09.269 --> 29:10.923
to catch him off guard
and hurt him.

29:10.966 --> 29:12.533
Then kidnap him.Yeah.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.056
Do you think
it was law enforcement?I don't know.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.493
But you know who I do think
we need to check up with?

29:16.537 --> 29:18.147
Detective Jack Tanaka.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.149
[line rings]

29:20.193 --> 29:22.761
Fatima,
contact the hospital.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.372
We need to speak
with Detective Tanaka.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.635
Thank you.

29:28.505 --> 29:30.072
Whoever came here,

29:30.116 --> 29:32.596
how did they know to make
Strauss a person of interest

29:32.640 --> 29:33.859
andget here before we did?

29:33.902 --> 29:36.687
Could be tracking
our communications.

29:36.731 --> 29:38.428
Hmm.

29:43.085 --> 29:46.219
You speak to Detective Tanaka?FATIMA:
Not yet.

29:46.262 --> 29:48.308
I spoke to the nurses,
and they said

29:48.351 --> 29:49.744
that they saw him
headed to the commissary

29:49.788 --> 29:51.485
and that they'll
page him right now.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.356
I'm not seeing any inquiries
into our case

29:53.400 --> 29:55.663
from any other
law enforcement agencies.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.708
Systems checks are running
on all of our comm devices.

29:57.752 --> 29:59.014
Should know pretty quickly

29:59.058 --> 30:00.363
if any of them have
been compromised.

30:00.407 --> 30:03.018
[chuckles][sighs]

30:03.062 --> 30:04.715
What's so funny?You.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.892
This setup
does not look comfortable.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.415
That's because it isn't.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.287
Look at this, will
you? They all got

30:11.331 --> 30:14.073
their big, nice desks,
comfy chairs.

30:14.116 --> 30:16.466
I mean, Kilbride's got
a whole glass office,

30:16.510 --> 30:18.860
and Hetty basically has

30:18.904 --> 30:21.863
a throne room, and we're
just supposed to make due.Yeah.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.518
Sometimes I set up my laptop on
the Pilates reformer in the gym.

30:24.561 --> 30:26.476
KILBRIDE:
Well, at least somebody's
getting some value

30:26.520 --> 30:29.740
out of that useless
but very expensive contraption.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.655
[clears throat]Admiral,

30:31.699 --> 30:33.135
I was just telling Fatima

30:33.179 --> 30:35.659
that I think we'd be a
little bit more productive

30:35.703 --> 30:37.226
if we had a personal
workspace to...

30:37.270 --> 30:39.315
You want personal space?

30:40.447 --> 30:42.405
Well, yes, sir. Like desks...

30:42.449 --> 30:44.407
Desks? How about offices?

30:44.451 --> 30:45.931
Mm.Offices with windows,

30:45.974 --> 30:47.541
little plants
scattered here and there.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.630
I like plants.[chuckles]Yeah.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.240
I don't want to impose,
but that sounds...

30:51.284 --> 30:52.589
Like it's never gonna happen.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.375
[clears throat]

30:55.418 --> 30:57.594
You know,
I've never really taken stock

30:57.638 --> 30:58.944
of this part of the building.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.467
What is all this?

31:00.510 --> 31:03.687
Looks like I'm backstage
at a Village People show.

31:03.731 --> 31:05.341
What's a Village People show?

31:06.429 --> 31:07.648
This is our wardrobe

31:07.691 --> 31:09.345
for undercover ops.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.784
Well, seems to me

31:13.828 --> 31:16.265
like a couple
of industrious young agents

31:16.309 --> 31:17.876
ought to be able to find
some other place

31:17.919 --> 31:19.660
to store all this wardrobe crap

31:19.703 --> 31:21.227
and make room in here

31:21.270 --> 31:22.315
for a couple
of decent-sized desks.

31:22.358 --> 31:23.577
Wait, you're telling me

31:23.620 --> 31:24.578
you're giving us permission...

31:24.621 --> 31:26.014
Don't speak. Just smile.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.102
[tablet beeps]

31:28.799 --> 31:30.845
None of our comm systems
have been compromised.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.151
Well, that's nice to hear,

31:32.194 --> 31:34.544
but it still doesn't explain
how somebody

31:34.588 --> 31:37.069
got to the Strauss residence
before us.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.767
[phone rings]FATIMA:
Special Agent Namazi.

31:40.594 --> 31:42.901
Okay, how long
has he been gone for?

31:44.032 --> 31:46.469
Okay. Uh, yeah,
if you could have security

31:46.513 --> 31:48.341
check the tapes
and get back to me,

31:48.384 --> 31:49.646
I would really appreciate it.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.866
Thank you. Detective Tanaka

31:51.910 --> 31:53.912
isn't anywhere in the hospital.
They can't find him.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.522
Well,

31:55.565 --> 31:58.829
I guess we just found
who beat us to Strauss.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.094
KENSI:
Whether it's Detective Tanaka

32:02.137 --> 32:04.226
or someone else,
they are definitely monitoring

32:04.270 --> 32:05.706
our investigation somehow.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.360
But we had Fatima
check our comms.

32:07.403 --> 32:09.014
No interagency inquiries.Right.

32:09.057 --> 32:11.146
And Kilbride said he wouldn't
be transmitting any updates

32:11.190 --> 32:12.800
to LAPD or the sheriff's.

32:12.843 --> 32:16.543
But somehow, Strauss's
location was leaked.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.719
Oh, no.What?

32:18.762 --> 32:20.721
Prints.Prints?

32:20.764 --> 32:22.157
The prints
on the spray can.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.419
We sent it
to the crime lab.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.160
[sighs]Fatima,

32:25.204 --> 32:26.945
pull up the records
from the crime lab

32:26.988 --> 32:28.729
on the spray paint can
that we found.

32:28.772 --> 32:30.383
See if anybody
accessed those results.

32:30.426 --> 32:31.906
Copy that. Pulling them up now.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.386
DEEKS:
If somebody has access
to those results,

32:33.429 --> 32:35.214
it's gonna lead them
directly to the house.

32:35.257 --> 32:38.173
The results were accessed from
an L.A. sheriff workstation.

32:38.217 --> 32:40.741
A Detective Matt Guerrero.KENSI: Nice.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.135
Do we have a location for him?FATIMA:
His workstation's still online,

32:43.178 --> 32:45.137
so he must be at the station.DEEKS:
Tell Castor

32:45.180 --> 32:46.747
to head over there,
invite him to the boathouse

32:46.790 --> 32:48.923
for a little interagency convo.FATIMA: Sure.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.708
But as soon as Castor shows up,
won't he know we're onto him?DEEKS: Absolutely.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.275
Which is why we're gonna
have Kilbride reach out

32:53.319 --> 32:55.321
to Guerrero's superior, bring
him up to speed, and have Castor

32:55.364 --> 32:56.713
ID himself as a federal agent

32:56.757 --> 32:57.932
looking
for background information

32:57.976 --> 32:59.586
on an old cold case.You got it.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.022
KENSI:
We're heading back
to the boatshed.

33:02.154 --> 33:04.330
So, we know you tipped
off Jack Tanaka.

33:04.373 --> 33:05.592
[door opens]

33:05.635 --> 33:06.941
[door closes]Who's that?

33:06.985 --> 33:08.682
It's this guy
that your sister dated.

33:08.725 --> 33:09.944
They may have broken up,
but it seems

33:09.988 --> 33:11.424
like you two like
to go surfing together.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.382
And then you went
to a Rams game together.

33:13.426 --> 33:14.557
Yeah, and that
Foo Fighters concert

33:14.601 --> 33:15.950
at the Forum
sure looked fun, huh?

33:15.994 --> 33:17.647
If you've forgotten
all these details,

33:17.691 --> 33:19.649
you could just check out
your own social media.

33:19.693 --> 33:22.087
[chuckles]Yeah.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.697
Yeah.

33:23.740 --> 33:26.178
Yeah, after Jack and my sister
broke up, we stayed friends.

33:26.221 --> 33:27.701
KENSI:
And after you told him
about the fingerprints,

33:27.744 --> 33:29.485
did he go to Strauss's home
and kidnap him?

33:29.529 --> 33:31.922
DEEKS:
Listen, we get it.
What Strauss did

33:31.966 --> 33:34.534
to Jack's dad is horrible.
It makes us sick.

33:34.577 --> 33:38.016
Right? But if Jack has Strauss,
we have to get to him

33:38.059 --> 33:40.105
before he does something
that he can't undo.

33:40.148 --> 33:43.282
As of today, his career
is probably over.

33:43.325 --> 33:46.633
He, uh, called me
after he snatched them up.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.417
"Them"?

33:48.461 --> 33:49.984
Strauss and his dad.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.942
He said
that when he got to the house,

33:51.986 --> 33:53.553
it was pretty evident
that Strauss's dad

33:53.596 --> 33:55.076
planned the attack.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.122
He needed a place to take them
'cause he knew that, uh,

33:57.165 --> 33:59.428
your team would show up
at the house any minute.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.126
Where did he take them?I busted

34:01.169 --> 34:03.432
some gang members
at an auto body shop last week.

34:03.476 --> 34:06.218
I knew the place
would be empty, so...DEEKS: What's the address?

34:06.261 --> 34:10.004
9389 Prairie in Hawthorne.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.136
[phone dials]

34:11.179 --> 34:12.702
KENSI:
Callen, it's Detective Tanaka.

34:12.746 --> 34:14.139
He's got Strauss

34:14.182 --> 34:16.184
and his father. The auto
body shop is in Hawthorne.

34:16.228 --> 34:17.664
On our way.

34:17.707 --> 34:19.579
[tires squealing]

34:28.544 --> 34:29.893
BILLY:
Dad, what's gonna happen now?

34:29.937 --> 34:31.156
BEN:
Billy, stop talking.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.505
BILLY:
Please, just let us go.

34:32.548 --> 34:33.680
BEN: You got what you wanted.BILLY: Please!

34:33.723 --> 34:35.160
BEN:
Just let us go.

34:35.203 --> 34:36.291
Federal agents! Drop the gun,

34:36.335 --> 34:37.901
Jack.

34:45.692 --> 34:48.695
Jack.Doing it now.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.045
Help us!

34:51.089 --> 34:53.308
Help us, please! Come
on! This guy's crazy!

34:53.352 --> 34:54.570
Help us!Shut up!

34:54.614 --> 34:55.658
I'm-a need you
to get on your knees

34:55.702 --> 34:56.920
and interlock your fingers

34:56.964 --> 34:58.618
behind your head,
Jack. On your knees!

34:58.661 --> 35:00.533
Dad, are they
gonna help us?

35:00.576 --> 35:02.361
Doing it now.

35:02.404 --> 35:03.753
Get us out of here!

35:03.797 --> 35:05.842
Come on, what the hell
are you waiting for?

35:05.886 --> 35:07.540
Do you know what he did to us?CALLEN:
I know what he didn't do to you.

35:07.583 --> 35:10.760
He didn't attack you from behind
and beat you two-to-one.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.066
Dad.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.415
[chuckles]:
Of course.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.939
Of course you people
would be siding with them.

35:15.983 --> 35:18.028
You two should be thanking
this man right now.[handcuffs click]

35:18.072 --> 35:21.641
BEN: Oh, yeah.This situation could have ended
a lot worse for you.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.775
Come on, Jack.

35:36.786 --> 35:38.919
In my head, Jack did
what he should have done.

35:38.962 --> 35:41.661
It just sucks that he's gonna
lose everything because of it.

35:41.704 --> 35:43.793
So, if that was your
dad in the hospital,

35:43.837 --> 35:45.404
you would've done
the same thing?[scoffs]

35:45.447 --> 35:47.928
Hell no. Not for my dad.

35:48.972 --> 35:50.322
You don't talk about
your family much.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.541
Yeah. My family's
not like yours.

35:52.585 --> 35:54.935
My little sister's my family.
She's everything.

35:54.978 --> 35:56.806
Then I need to meet her.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.331
Yeah, you do.

36:00.506 --> 36:02.725
So, you going
to jujitsu tonight?

36:02.769 --> 36:04.249
[inhales]

36:04.292 --> 36:06.120
[groans]
I mean, I should.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.122
I just, uh...Pizza at Mulberry's instead?

36:08.166 --> 36:09.515
Hell yeah.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.952
Let's go, partner.Uh, you buying, right?

36:11.995 --> 36:14.737
[Fatima laughs]

36:16.130 --> 36:19.002
So, essentially, Papa Strauss
dedicates his whole entire life

36:19.046 --> 36:21.179
into turning his son
into some sort of hate machine.

36:21.222 --> 36:24.312
Yeah. Not exactly the best
version of a life well-lived.

36:24.356 --> 36:25.879
But it's so crazy
when you think about it

36:25.922 --> 36:27.359
from a parenting perspective,
right?

36:27.402 --> 36:29.012
Like, if he wasn't
so full of hate,

36:29.056 --> 36:31.493
if he wasn't so afraid,
if he wasn't so angry

36:31.537 --> 36:34.235
and therefore
didn't poison his son,

36:34.279 --> 36:36.716
then maybe none of this happens.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.239
You know,
maybe Lieutenant Tanaka's

36:38.283 --> 36:40.676
out there fishing on that pier
like he always does.

36:40.720 --> 36:44.289
Yeah. And he's gonna be
out there fishing again.

36:44.332 --> 36:47.640
Right?Yeah.

36:47.683 --> 36:49.381
Yeah.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.992
Baby, it is just as easy

36:52.035 --> 36:53.994
for us to raise our child
with love and acceptance

36:54.037 --> 36:57.040
as it is to fill them
with fear and anger.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.264
I hope so.I know so.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.527
[phone vibrates]

37:07.877 --> 37:10.750
Oh. Look at that.
Got to go.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.143
Otherwise, you're gonna miss
your live Peloton class.
