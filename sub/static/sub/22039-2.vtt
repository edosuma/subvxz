09:47.830 --> 09:50.068
- Yeah.
- Are you circumcised?

09:50.069 --> 09:52.468
- I dunno.
- How don't you know?

09:52.469 --> 09:54.507
I just don't know. I've never really...

09:54.508 --> 09:57.668
Never really looked
into it, kind of thing.

09:58.787 --> 10:01.746
Well, have you got a bell
end, have you got a knob end?

10:01.747 --> 10:04.465
Or have you got a foreskin?

10:05.655 --> 10:07.106
- I don't...
- Have you got a helmet there?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.984
Or is there a bit... a bit of
skin covering your helmet?

10:09.985 --> 10:12.184
Like a sausage? Like
the end of a sausage?

10:12.185 --> 10:13.783
It's just, like, um...

10:13.784 --> 10:15.630
It's kind of in between, I guess.

10:16.384 --> 10:18.182
Didn't you talk to your mum about it?

10:18.959 --> 10:20.742
Have you ever spoken to a doctor?

10:21.418 --> 10:22.862
My mum's not a doctor.

10:26.142 --> 10:29.500
Maybe, um, you could give us a look?

10:29.501 --> 10:32.020
Let me know what's going on down there.

10:32.021 --> 10:33.579
I'm not showing you my dick.

10:34.157 --> 10:35.355
Look at mine.

10:35.380 --> 10:37.579
Just tell me what's going on.

10:37.580 --> 10:39.298
I'm not looking at your dick.

10:39.299 --> 10:40.778
Just give us a little look.

10:40.779 --> 10:42.857
I'm not gonna look at your cock, mate.

10:42.858 --> 10:45.137
- I'll then leave you alone.
- I'm not looking at your dick.

10:45.138 --> 10:46.617
We can make this a thing

10:46.618 --> 10:48.976
that will go on all bloody night then.

10:48.977 --> 10:50.456
Help a mate out.

10:50.457 --> 10:52.016
I'm your boss.

10:52.017 --> 10:53.815
You technically have to do it.

10:53.816 --> 10:56.055
Please. Please, man, please.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.633
I've always wondered.

10:58.608 --> 10:59.790
Please.

10:59.815 --> 11:01.415
It'd mean a lot to me, yeah?

11:03.014 --> 11:05.254
I didn't grow up with brothers.

11:06.534 --> 11:08.252
Just a really, really quick look.

11:08.253 --> 11:10.092
- Okay.
- Just flash it to me.

11:10.093 --> 11:11.612
- I can make up my mind.
- Okay.

11:11.613 --> 11:13.331
And then you're gonna put it away, yeah?

11:13.332 --> 11:14.811
- I'm ready. Get in there.
- Yeah.

11:14.812 --> 11:18.530
Three, two, one. In you go.

11:18.531 --> 11:21.010
You little pervert.
You were gonna do it.

11:21.011 --> 11:23.209
- Get stuffed.
- You were fully gonna look.

11:23.210 --> 11:25.169
- You're the pervert.
- You're the pervert.

11:25.170 --> 11:27.409
You were gonna whip
out your dick for all and sundry.

11:27.410 --> 11:29.528
You were gonna look.
I wasn't gonna whip it out.

11:29.529 --> 11:31.608
"Everyone, inspect my
dick, inspect my dick."

11:31.609 --> 11:34.647
- Get the fuck out of there.
- Hey. [CACKLES]

11:34.648 --> 11:37.127
You ARE circumcised.

11:37.128 --> 11:40.967
I'm actually... I'm actually
fine with it. I'm fine with it.

11:45.006 --> 11:46.645
- [WHISTLES]
- APRIL: Car 72, please report.

11:46.646 --> 11:49.124
- Car 72, please report.
- Hey, mine.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.244
- Car 72. No activity.
- Thank you, Hendy.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.883
Actually, um, there is a
little bit of activity

11:54.884 --> 11:57.723
with my heart rate when I
hear your voice, April.

11:57.724 --> 11:59.842
CAROL: Car 72. Protocol.

11:59.843 --> 12:02.042
- Nothing, no activity.
- Are you serious?

12:02.043 --> 12:04.041
- Oh, come on.
- That was pathetic.

12:04.042 --> 12:06.041
- I know.
- What's all that about?

12:06.042 --> 12:08.800
Well, I thought about what
you said about April,

12:08.801 --> 12:11.720
her voice sounding nice, looked
her up on the old social media.

12:11.721 --> 12:13.399
- Oh, stalker.
- Yeah.

12:14.155 --> 12:15.120
Hot!

12:15.120 --> 12:16.719
HENDY: Yeah. Worth stalking.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.358
Whoo. Get your lips around that.

12:19.359 --> 12:21.158
But what was that?

12:21.159 --> 12:23.837
That was a whole lot of shit
falling out your mouth.

12:23.838 --> 12:25.997
I planned it out.
It sounded so much better...

12:25.998 --> 12:27.876
I'm just bad on the phone.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.716
I'm good in the room, bad on the phone.

12:29.717 --> 12:31.756
Yes, yes. I will say...

12:31.757 --> 12:33.275
I'm the opposite. I'm like...

12:33.276 --> 12:35.115
On the phone, I can
have girls like that,

12:35.116 --> 12:38.994
like hook 'em, 'cause I have
these dulcet tones in my voice.

12:38.995 --> 12:41.674
It's just when they get to know me,

12:41.675 --> 12:44.433
it falls apart pretty quick.

12:44.434 --> 12:45.446
Mmm.

12:45.994 --> 12:48.952
I will help you out. I'm April.

12:48.953 --> 12:50.832
No, you're not.
No, we're not doing that.

12:50.833 --> 12:53.391
- Just... go with me.
- No. No, I'm not going with you.

12:53.392 --> 12:56.031
What else are we gonna do?
Look where we are.

12:56.508 --> 12:57.753
Come on.

12:59.151 --> 13:01.390
- [SIGHS] All right.
- All right.

13:01.391 --> 13:03.989
[SULTRY VOICE] Hey, sexy. How are you?

13:04.511 --> 13:06.429
No. I can't. Not with your face.

13:06.430 --> 13:08.348
I can't think about her looking at that.

13:08.349 --> 13:10.708
Imagine her head on my
shoulders just for a second.

13:10.709 --> 13:12.508
No, it's horrible, it's horrible.
Forget it.

13:12.509 --> 13:14.147
All right. Okay. Look.

13:14.148 --> 13:16.427
Ah. All right. Here.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.267
- Oh, come on.
- Just go with me.

13:22.126 --> 13:23.785
[SULTRY VOICE] Hey, sexy. How are you?

13:23.786 --> 13:26.465
That's ridiculous. She doesn't
speak like a chipmunk.

13:26.466 --> 13:28.704
Oh. [DEEP VOICE] Hey. Hey, sexy.
How are you?

13:28.705 --> 13:31.104
That's too low. Just
do your normal voice.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.823
[NORMAL VOICE] Hey, sexy, how are you?

13:33.824 --> 13:35.863
- Go back to the first one.
- What, the high one?

13:35.864 --> 13:38.062
- High one.
- Hey. Hey, sexy. How are...?

13:38.063 --> 13:39.702
- Down.
- [VOICE WAVERS]

13:39.703 --> 13:41.462
- Up. Start from the top.
- [HIGH-PITCHED HUM] Hey!

13:41.463 --> 13:43.261
- [HUMS]
- Where are you? Come down.

13:43.262 --> 13:46.061
- [HUMS DOWN NOTES]
- Down. Down. There.

13:46.062 --> 13:47.541
- [SLIGHTLY HIGH-PITCHED] Ah.
- That's fine.

13:47.542 --> 13:49.940
- Hey, Hendy. What's going on?
- Yep. Hey!

13:49.941 --> 13:51.660
Hey, April.

13:51.661 --> 13:54.779
Um... Car 72, no activity.

13:54.780 --> 13:57.499
- Oh. Okay, 'bye.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

13:57.500 --> 14:01.338
- I... wanted to just say hi.
- Yeah.

14:01.339 --> 14:05.057
I wondered if I... How is
your employment thus far?

14:05.058 --> 14:07.737
It's fine. It's fine. What's going on?
Why are you ringing?

14:07.738 --> 14:10.016
Oh, I'm just socially, casually...

14:10.017 --> 14:12.136
- Mmm.
- Um, requesting...

14:12.137 --> 14:13.615
- Yes?
- Uh, perhaps...

14:13.616 --> 14:15.655
- Get to the point.
- Uhhh...

14:15.656 --> 14:18.094
- If you'd like a beverage?
- Ooooh!

14:18.095 --> 14:20.094
- A social beverage?
- Ooh, you sound nice.

14:20.095 --> 14:21.854
- I'd like that. Be nice.
- Well, thank you.

14:21.855 --> 14:23.373
- I...
- What else?

14:23.374 --> 14:26.493
What else? Well, we could see...
Perhaps have a meal.

14:26.494 --> 14:29.692
Oh. A meal? This is sounding
strangely like a date.

14:29.693 --> 14:31.332
Are you asking me out on a date?

14:31.333 --> 14:34.091
Well, uh, if you wanna
formally call it that.

14:34.092 --> 14:35.891
You ARE asking me out on a date.

14:35.892 --> 14:38.330
- Sure.
- Oh, that's... Hang on.

14:38.331 --> 14:41.410
You're... This is, uh...
No, no, no. Hang on.

14:41.411 --> 14:45.049
I barely know you. This is
harassment in the workplace.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.888
Do you wanna have sex with me?
Is that what this is?

14:47.889 --> 14:49.608
Oh, Carol, this is not on.

14:49.609 --> 14:51.728
Hendy's harassing me in the workplace.

14:51.729 --> 14:53.447
- Phone call's over. Click.
- "Ah, Your Honour."

14:53.448 --> 14:55.687
"Detective Hendy"

14:55.688 --> 14:57.607
"has been harassing April
in the workplace."

14:57.608 --> 14:59.886
"No, I haven't. I didn't
say I wanted sex."

14:59.887 --> 15:01.566
"I just asked her out on a movie."

15:01.567 --> 15:03.086
"Oh, guilty."

15:04.366 --> 15:07.046
- Didn't go too well, did it?
- Nup.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:16.407 --> 15:18.167
Got this shit?

15:19.675 --> 15:20.858
No?

15:21.929 --> 15:24.281
- Jimmy's a shit name.
- Hmm?

15:24.282 --> 15:26.481
What's your real name? Is it James?

15:26.482 --> 15:28.280
Jimmy or Jim.

15:28.281 --> 15:30.000
Were you born James?

15:30.001 --> 15:31.680
Yeah, my birth certificate, yeah.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.239
- It's a nice name.
- Oh, thank you.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.759
Stay James. Just be James. It's good.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.278
Well, I've always been called Jimmy.

15:38.279 --> 15:41.492
Yeah, but James is,
like, more dignified.

15:41.517 --> 15:44.032
Know what I mean? Like,
come up to my level.

15:44.057 --> 15:46.816
I'm not, like, you know,
the Prince of Denmark.

15:46.817 --> 15:48.735
- Who?
- Sounds a bit...

15:48.736 --> 15:52.055
I dunno. Like French
royalty or something.

15:52.056 --> 15:55.054
- In Denmark? The French?
- I dunno.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.723
I dunno.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.493
Yeah. Jimmy. It sounds like a dog.

15:59.494 --> 16:01.293
"Jimmy." [WHISTLES]

16:01.294 --> 16:03.013
"Jimmy. Here, Jimmy."

16:03.014 --> 16:04.465
"Stop humping me leg, Jimmy."

16:04.490 --> 16:06.330
I'm not a dog, mate.

16:07.423 --> 16:09.262
They call me the bubble man.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.266
The what?

16:12.322 --> 16:14.320
- The bubble man.
- And why's that?

16:15.076 --> 16:17.560
Bubblegum. It's my calling card.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.279
So I stick the bubblegum

16:19.280 --> 16:21.239
under a bit of furniture, just randomly.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.919
Could be any piece of furniture,

16:22.920 --> 16:24.678
and forensics get in
there and they're like,

16:24.679 --> 16:26.238
"The bubble man was in."

16:26.239 --> 16:27.839
The bubble man.

16:30.358 --> 16:33.436
Don't you think that's
a little bit... unwise,

16:33.437 --> 16:35.237
given that you're basically...

16:36.317 --> 16:38.476
giving them a sample of your DNA?

16:40.638 --> 16:42.476
Shut up, James.

16:45.915 --> 16:49.153
Humour. That's what you're
missing, mate. Too desperate.

16:49.154 --> 16:52.992
All right. Jokes. Tell her a joke.
Got any jokes?

16:52.993 --> 16:54.992
- I've only got one joke.
- Well, tell it.

16:55.940 --> 16:57.792
Where did Hitler keep all his armies?

16:57.793 --> 16:59.991
- Where?
- Up his sleevies.

17:01.073 --> 17:02.351
Too soon.

17:02.907 --> 17:04.790
Look, here. Here's a joke.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.670
Two vomits walking down the street.

17:06.671 --> 17:08.148
- Stop.
- Why?

17:08.150 --> 17:10.829
Disgusting and visually confusing.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.829
How are the vomits
walking down the street?

17:12.829 --> 17:15.428
Well, they're sliding down the street.

17:15.429 --> 17:17.867
- That's... It's irrelevant, okay?
- Have they got legs?

17:17.868 --> 17:19.707
- Well, no, they're on their fluids.
- Okay.

17:19.708 --> 17:22.945
All right. Two vomits
fluiding down the street.

17:22.946 --> 17:25.346
They get to the corner.
One of them drops to his knees.

17:25.347 --> 17:26.866
He's completely emotional,

17:26.867 --> 17:28.545
and the other vomit
says, "Are you okay?"

17:28.546 --> 17:32.906
He says, "Yeah. It's just that I
was brought up on this corner."

17:35.785 --> 17:36.896
Nup.

17:39.144 --> 17:42.783
MAN: We've got no sign of the
target shipment at this time.

17:42.784 --> 17:44.943
Uh, all points, hold position.

17:51.102 --> 17:54.420
- G'day, guys. You still there?
- Yes, Jacob.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.540
Yeah, this is Jacob from Port Security.

17:56.541 --> 18:00.299
Uh, there's been 30 minutes
now since we last spoke.

18:00.300 --> 18:03.378
And there's been really an
unusual absence of activity.

18:03.379 --> 18:06.538
I was wondering is that the sort
of thing you'd be interested in?

18:06.539 --> 18:08.257
No, that's not out of the ordinary.

18:08.258 --> 18:10.897
It's in no way useful to us.
Thank you, Jacob. Over and out.

18:10.898 --> 18:12.936
I just... I'm finding it hard.

18:12.937 --> 18:16.136
I wanna be... I wanna be a
good member of this team.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.776
I mean, I'm your tool down here.

18:17.777 --> 18:20.375
- You are a tool, yes.
- I'm your eyes on the dock.

18:20.376 --> 18:23.454
And it would help if I knew
what I was looking for.

18:23.455 --> 18:25.094
HENDY: No, you're not
looking for anything, mate.

18:25.095 --> 18:27.094
Terrorism? Drugs?

18:27.095 --> 18:29.173
Look, I understand that
you can't compromise

18:29.174 --> 18:31.173
your investigation by
telling me the exact nature

18:31.174 --> 18:33.172
of what you're looking for,
but I've had a thought.

18:33.173 --> 18:35.212
I'll say 'terrorism'

18:35.213 --> 18:38.491
and if you don't say
anything for five seconds,

18:38.492 --> 18:40.531
then I will know it's terrorism.

18:40.532 --> 18:42.011
So I say 'terrorism'.

18:42.012 --> 18:43.850
Five seconds silence, then
it's terrorism, okay?

18:43.851 --> 18:47.210
Here we go. [WHISPERS] Terrorism.

18:47.211 --> 18:49.769
- Jacob, we can't disclose...
- Whoa, okay.

18:49.770 --> 18:51.489
So it's not terrorism. Terrorism.

18:51.490 --> 18:52.968
HENDY: Well, we're not
saying either way.

18:52.969 --> 18:54.728
- Okay, so...
- No, we haven't established...

18:54.729 --> 18:57.008
I know. I get it. [CHUCKLES]

18:57.009 --> 18:58.647
- HENDY: Do you?
- Yeah. Okay.

18:58.648 --> 19:00.807
Um... All right.

19:00.808 --> 19:03.606
So if it's human trafficking,
like boat people,

19:03.607 --> 19:07.126
um, sniff twice.

19:07.127 --> 19:08.925
[WHISPERS] Human trafficking.

19:08.926 --> 19:10.925
[ENGINE ROARS]

19:10.926 --> 19:12.645
- HENDY: Jacob, I...
- I couldn't hear.

19:12.646 --> 19:15.084
I couldn't hear, sorry.
Something went past the window.

19:15.085 --> 19:17.044
- HENDY: Be quiet for a second.
- Yep.

19:17.045 --> 19:19.643
HENDY: Uh, I'm not gonna
disclose to you what it is.

19:19.644 --> 19:21.443
- No, I know, mate.
- HENDY: At all.

19:21.444 --> 19:23.042
I know. I got it.

19:23.043 --> 19:25.162
Not terrorism. Not boat people. Right.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.242
- [STOKES SNORES]
- JACOB: Okay, so if it's impo...

19:27.243 --> 19:29.361
imports of exotic birds,

19:29.362 --> 19:33.160
like parrots or, um, or certain terns...

19:33.161 --> 19:35.960
HENDY: Listen, Jacob. Um...
God, I love talking to you.

19:35.961 --> 19:38.759
It's almost too much fun. Um... So...

19:38.760 --> 19:40.879
- JACOB: Meat products?
- No.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.839
- Fireworks?
- Yeah, it is fireworks.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.558
- It's fireworks.
- No, it's not.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.678
HENDY: It is. Keep an
eye out for fireworks.

19:46.679 --> 19:50.837
[CHUCKLES] Oh, it's good that
we got some banter going.

19:50.838 --> 19:53.196
I think it's probably pretty
good for team dynamics.

19:53.197 --> 19:54.796
HENDY: Yeah.

19:54.797 --> 19:57.636
- It's not fireworks, is it?
- HENDY: Definitely fireworks.

19:57.637 --> 19:59.115
Do keep an eye out for fireworks.

19:59.116 --> 20:01.475
Let us know if you see any fireworks.
Thanks, Jacob.

20:01.476 --> 20:03.634
All right. Keeping an eye
out for fireworks.

Stokes. Stokes.

20:13.937 --> 20:15.552
Did you hear that?

20:16.024 --> 20:17.127
No.

20:17.433 --> 20:20.991
- I thought someone shot something.
- No.

20:20.992 --> 20:23.310
[EXHALES LOUDLY]

20:23.311 --> 20:26.110
- Can you do that without the noise?
- Yeah.

20:26.700 --> 20:29.590
Or better still, maybe do your job.

20:30.025 --> 20:31.389
Like I'm doing.

20:31.390 --> 20:32.948
You know, I'm on stand-by.

20:32.949 --> 20:35.388
- I'm ready to go.
- Right, sorry.

20:35.389 --> 20:38.308
Just a bit boring when
there's just nothing...

20:39.668 --> 20:41.587
There's nothing happening. Okay.

20:41.588 --> 20:45.386
I was trying to use
that time... productively.

20:45.387 --> 20:47.146
All right, I'm gonna do it.

20:47.147 --> 20:48.625
- What?
- I'm gonna do it.

20:48.626 --> 20:50.465
- No, don't go off...
- Yes, I'm gonna do it.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.785
- You're half cocked.
- No, I don't listen to you.

20:52.786 --> 20:55.064
You put me off with your stupid shit.

20:55.065 --> 20:56.944
You're not good with women.
I'm good with women.

20:56.945 --> 20:58.903
You look away.

20:58.904 --> 21:00.823
- Heed my advice.
- No advice.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.383
- Look away. Look away.
- No.

21:02.384 --> 21:04.222
Don't look at me while I do this.

21:04.223 --> 21:07.182
I mean, it's been about
three hours since a call.

21:07.183 --> 21:10.781
Does anything really
ever happen here much?

21:10.782 --> 21:12.822
Or is it a lot of this?

21:14.381 --> 21:16.460
- [CLEARS THROAT]
- There is a lot of this.

21:16.461 --> 21:18.059
I'll be honest.

21:19.051 --> 21:20.488
This is Car...

21:22.340 --> 21:25.459
This is Car 72. Come in, over. Car 72.

Car 72. This is Carol.

You got...

21:31.218 --> 21:34.056
Carol, could you please put April on?

21:34.057 --> 21:35.696
No. Why?

21:35.697 --> 21:38.095
Uh, because there is something
of a personal nature

21:38.096 --> 21:39.695
that, uh, we need to discuss.

21:39.696 --> 21:42.016
Of a... Just put her on, please.

21:43.175 --> 21:45.094
And don't listen to it, please.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.374
- Pull out. Pull out.
- This is too... Shut up.

21:52.933 --> 21:55.052
April. It's Hendy here.

How are you?

21:59.212 --> 22:01.051
Fine, thanks.

22:01.052 --> 22:02.811
I just wanted to let you know

22:02.812 --> 22:05.090
that the ship has been delayed,

22:05.091 --> 22:07.610
so will be in for a
bit of a longer wait.

22:07.611 --> 22:09.129
Shut the fuck up.

22:09.130 --> 22:11.010
Yeah, okay.

22:12.697 --> 22:14.689
And also, um...

22:16.929 --> 22:18.607
- How are you?
- [STOKES GROANS]

22:18.608 --> 22:20.207
Sorry. Sorry, did you...

22:20.208 --> 22:22.248
Do you want something? 'Cause...

22:24.847 --> 22:26.966
Two vomits were walking down the street

22:26.967 --> 22:30.845
and one of the vomits
became very emotional

22:30.846 --> 22:32.725
and fell to his knees.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.524
And the other vomit...
He started crying.

22:34.525 --> 22:37.004
And the other vomit
said, "What's wrong?"

22:37.005 --> 22:40.963
And the crying vomit said,
"I was brought up on this corner."

22:40.964 --> 22:44.203
[LAUGHS] That's funny. That's good.

22:46.003 --> 22:47.522
It's important to laugh, isn't it?

22:47.523 --> 22:49.401
You see a lot of fluids on the job.

22:49.402 --> 22:52.481
And, uh, if you don't
laugh, you'll, uh...

22:53.538 --> 22:55.251
you'll develop cancer.

22:55.283 --> 22:57.000
Yeah.

22:57.934 --> 22:59.015
Uh...

22:59.040 --> 23:01.719
Yes, I've known some people with cancer,

23:01.720 --> 23:03.718
and that's certainly not funny.
