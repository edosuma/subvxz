certainly safer than here.

the body of the Library...

It's the operating system?

20:46.524 --> 20:47.992

20:47.993 --> 20:50.661
So you're saying that when
the Library came back,

20:50.662 --> 20:52.746
its spirit was stripped by Glasney?

20:52.747 --> 20:54.615
Yeah, well, either that or the trauma

20:54.616 --> 20:56.116
of its return from the void

20:56.117 --> 20:58.869
left it vulnerable to
a powerful predator.

20:58.870 --> 21:00.587
Whoever Ray Glasney is,

21:00.588 --> 21:04.124
he has left the Library
without nourishment.

21:04.125 --> 21:06.093
The Library eats now?

21:06.094 --> 21:08.012
[Sighs] Yes, Mr. Jones,

21:08.013 --> 21:10.597

21:12.133 --> 21:13.634

21:14.853 --> 21:17.021
