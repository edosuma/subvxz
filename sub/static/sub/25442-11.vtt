00:03.420 --> 00:06.420
Raven:
Raven's Home was filmed
in front of a live
studio audience.

00:08.460 --> 00:09.620
Oh, good morning, Nia.

00:10.460 --> 00:12.580
Wow. Somebody is
in a good mood.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.580
Oh, of course.
Why wouldn't I be?

00:14.580 --> 00:18.540
I woke up,
and I was still... me.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.500
What's it like
to wake up you?

00:21.500 --> 00:23.250
-Well--
-You know what?

00:23.250 --> 00:25.250
Don't answer that.
It'll just bring me down.

00:26.420 --> 00:28.580
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
you're definitely still you.

00:28.580 --> 00:31.290
Right down to those
two little hairs
on your chin.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.330
(school bell rings)

00:35.330 --> 00:37.420
Hey, Mr Patel
isn't here yet.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.330
Hopefully, we have a sub.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.290
Ooh, I love subs.

00:41.290 --> 00:43.250
Especially a fat, Italian one.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.460
He's talking about a teacher.

00:46.250 --> 00:47.290
So am I.

00:47.290 --> 00:48.580
Remember Mr. Rotundi?

00:48.580 --> 00:50.330
I loved that
chubby guy!

00:50.330 --> 00:54.290
I'm sure that Jackson's dad
is doing the best thing
for his family,

00:54.290 --> 00:57.290
but we do not have
milkshakes for breakfast.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.580
Gabriel...

00:58.580 --> 01:02.330
Well, then maybe you should
just go live at Jackson's house.

01:03.620 --> 01:05.620
Look, we'll talk
about this later.

01:06.620 --> 01:07.620
Love you!

01:08.670 --> 01:10.330
Say it back.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.620
Say it back!

01:13.790 --> 01:15.290
He said it.

01:16.290 --> 01:17.500
(quietly):
He didn't say it.

01:19.670 --> 01:22.620
Uh, Mr. Patel,
are you okay?

01:22.620 --> 01:25.500
Yep, totally fine.
That's what happens

01:25.500 --> 01:27.710
when your kid doesn't appreciate
what you do for a living,

01:27.710 --> 01:29.790
and he thinks
you're ruining his life,

01:29.790 --> 01:31.670
because you're "just a teacher,"

01:31.670 --> 01:33.620
who won't let him have
a milkshake for breakfast.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.500
I mean, who even does that?

01:35.500 --> 01:38.290
I had a chocolate chip
protein shake this morning.

01:38.290 --> 01:39.620
Ooh, I had
a root beer float.

01:39.620 --> 01:40.330
Anyone else?

01:42.380 --> 01:44.710
Well, why don't you all just
go live at Jackson's house?

01:46.540 --> 01:48.540
You know what?
No assignment.

01:48.540 --> 01:51.830
Instead of your next test,
I want everyone to do a project

01:51.830 --> 01:54.380
on what your parents do
for a living,

01:54.380 --> 01:57.500
so that you can learn
to appreciate them more.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.500
Any questions?

01:58.500 --> 02:01.540
Yeah.
Isn't this math class?

02:01.540 --> 02:03.380
Shh!

02:03.380 --> 02:05.500
A math assignment
with no math?

02:05.500 --> 02:08.500
It's the only kind
of math I'm good at.

Oh, yeah.

03:14.750 --> 03:15.790

Work that Scut glute! Yeah!

03:18.920 --> 03:20.750
-Great news, Mom.
-Yes, sweetie?

03:20.750 --> 03:23.420
We have to do a report
for school on your career

03:23.420 --> 03:24.790
and how much
we appreciate it.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.790
A report? On me?

03:26.790 --> 03:29.580
Yeah, and we were thinking
we'd interview you on camera

03:29.580 --> 03:31.580
and make, like,
this cool video presentation.

03:31.580 --> 03:33.460
(gasping)

03:33.460 --> 03:34.460
Of me?

03:35.500 --> 03:37.460
-On camera?
-Yeah. (squeals)

03:37.460 --> 03:38.670
I gotta check my schedule,

03:38.670 --> 03:40.420
but the only thing
I gotta do is my hair.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.420
I gotta do my hair!
(laughing)

03:42.420 --> 03:43.460
Levi, guess what!

03:43.460 --> 03:45.790
I'm gonna be on TV!
(giggling)

03:45.790 --> 03:48.460
TV? That's nothing.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.790
You're gonna be on Tokyo.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.540
What do you mean?

03:51.540 --> 03:52.710
Check this out.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.830
(growling)

03:54.830 --> 03:55.620
Cool! How'd you do that?

03:55.620 --> 04:00.540
It's this new app
that green-screens people
onto silly backgrounds.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.540
Now, you're Bookerzilla.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.880
Whoa! Yo, I'm huge.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.670
Hey, look at me
crush this building.

04:06.670 --> 04:09.460
-(grunting)
-Booker, Booker, focus.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.540
Now, what
we need to crush
is our project.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.880
I'm thinking that
we should do our interview
on Mom's fashion career.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.460
-Clothes? Seriously?
-Yeah.

04:16.460 --> 04:20.460
No way.
We should definitely do it
on Mom's Scut driving.

04:20.460 --> 04:22.500
I mean, that's
the exciting stuff,

04:22.500 --> 04:24.500
the interesting
people she meets,

04:24.500 --> 04:26.670
the stories,
the adventures.

04:26.670 --> 04:28.790
No, no. I think
Mom following her dreams

04:28.790 --> 04:30.960
of becoming a fashion designer
is way more exciting.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.920
Well, right now,
I have a dream,

04:32.920 --> 04:34.830
and it's to get
a good grade in math.

04:34.830 --> 04:37.670
I have a dream
that my brother
would use a glass.

04:38.670 --> 04:41.880
Now, come on, Booker.
This project has to be
better than Zeena's.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.830
Oh! Now I get it.

04:44.830 --> 04:46.830
Looks like someone
got Zeena-ed.

04:46.830 --> 04:50.540
Yeah, big-time,
but she's about to get Nia-ed
right in the project.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.670
Why do you let her
get under your skin
so much?

04:52.670 --> 04:54.710
I'm just so tired
of her being all,

04:54.710 --> 04:57.670
(imitating Zeena)
"I woke up, and I was me.

04:57.670 --> 04:59.830
"I'm a better stepper,

04:59.830 --> 05:02.670
and my project is gonna be
the best one in class."

05:03.750 --> 05:06.540
Well, this time,
my project is gonna
be better than hers.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.880
So, now it's
your project?

05:08.880 --> 05:11.830
(scoffs)
Well, I clearly have
the better take on it.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.960
Oh, no, no, no. See,
Booker is not having that.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.540
So, so you're gonna go
all third person on me?

05:18.540 --> 05:19.750
'Cause Nia is not having that.

05:20.710 --> 05:22.880
Ooh, Levi is enjoying this.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.750
I'm gonna make you
sumo wrestlers.

05:25.750 --> 05:29.750
You know, Booker thinks
maybe we should just do
our projects separately.

05:29.750 --> 05:32.580
Finally, something
that Nia agrees with.

05:32.580 --> 05:33.750
-Mm-hmm.
-Here.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.580
Wait. Come back.

05:35.580 --> 05:37.710
I need you to bump your bellies.

05:41.710 --> 05:44.750
I'm Booker Baxter-Carter,
and my project is

05:44.750 --> 05:47.880
on my mom and her amazing,
incredible Scut career.

05:47.880 --> 05:52.540
So, Mom, tell us
what it's really like
to be a Scut driver.

05:53.540 --> 05:57.830
Well, first, my app tells me
when someone needs a ride.

05:57.830 --> 05:59.920
Yeah?

05:59.920 --> 06:03.670
And then, I pick them up.

06:03.670 --> 06:05.790
Go on.

06:06.750 --> 06:09.620
And then I drive them
to their destination.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.790
And then?

06:12.790 --> 06:15.580
And then, I drop them off.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.000
And then?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.670
And then, and then,

06:19.670 --> 06:21.960
and then,
I do it all over again.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.790
But you have
exciting conversations

06:25.790 --> 06:27.790
with exciting people
on the way, though,
right?

06:27.790 --> 06:28.960
Oh! Oh, yes. Yes!

06:28.960 --> 06:31.920
Just yesterday,
I picked up a police officer

06:31.920 --> 06:33.670
whose squad car
was broken down.

06:33.670 --> 06:36.960
Yes! Yes!
And then you two,
uh, spotted a crime,

06:36.960 --> 06:38.120
got into a high-speed chase,

06:38.120 --> 06:40.790
ended in you
tackling the perps?

06:41.960 --> 06:44.960
No, I just dropped him off
at the police station.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.960
♪ ♪

06:52.960 --> 06:57.040
So, Mom, tell us
about your incredible
passion for fashion.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.670
Well...

06:59.670 --> 07:03.670
there's a dream
in every seam.

07:03.670 --> 07:07.830
I scratch my creative itch
with every stitch.

07:07.830 --> 07:10.000
I'm hoping to make
a lot of bread
with every thread.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.620
Okay, that's enough
of rhyming.

07:12.620 --> 07:13.960
You started it.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.790
(quietly):
Do you want me
to start over?

07:15.790 --> 07:17.670
No, no, no.
We're just setting
to the good stuff.

07:17.670 --> 07:20.830
So, Mom, in simple,
non-rhyming words,

07:20.830 --> 07:22.710
tell us what the most
exciting part

07:22.710 --> 07:24.710
of the creative
process is for you.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.880
The most exciting part
of the design process

07:26.880 --> 07:28.880
is when I get
my first inspiration.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.750
And for me, that's color,

07:31.750 --> 07:35.000
you know, and all of
its endless possibilities.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.670
-Here comes the good stuff.
-First, you have,

07:37.670 --> 07:40.750
you got red, orange, yellow,

07:40.750 --> 07:42.880
green, blue, indigo, violet.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.040
And that's just ROY-G-BIV.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.830
(Raven laughing)

07:46.830 --> 07:48.830
Girrrl...

07:48.830 --> 07:51.040
don't even get me started
on the tertiary colors.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.040
Bam!

07:54.040 --> 07:57.670
Khaki, brown, puce,
mauve, light mauve...

07:57.670 --> 08:00.880
Goldenrod, cerulean,
light cerulean,

08:00.880 --> 08:03.920
-chartreuse--
-Okay, I get it!
There are a lot of colors.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.920
I'm sorry.
Just when do we get
to the good stuff,

08:07.920 --> 08:11.750
like a fashion show,
a piece of clothing,
a sock, anything?

08:11.750 --> 08:14.880
Oh, well, sweetheart,
the finished product

08:14.880 --> 08:17.210
is just the tip
of the design iceberg.

08:17.210 --> 08:20.040
The excitement
is in the details

08:20.040 --> 08:22.880
and all of the hard work
that goes into it,

08:22.880 --> 08:24.880
which, I must say,

08:24.880 --> 08:28.710
brings me... to fabric.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.790
You got suede, leather,
silk, satin,

08:33.790 --> 08:36.210
cotton, poly, poly-cotton,
cotton-poly blend,

08:36.210 --> 08:39.040
wool, wool-poly-cotton blend,
poly-cotton-wool blend,

08:39.040 --> 08:41.790
denim, light denim,
black denim, funky denim...

08:44.750 --> 08:47.000
And then,
I do it all over again.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.080
(computer beeps off)

08:49.080 --> 08:51.080
(grumbling)

08:51.080 --> 08:52.790
Knock, knock.

08:53.830 --> 08:54.830
'Sup?

08:55.960 --> 08:57.920
'Sup?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.920
How's your, uh, project
coming along?

09:00.920 --> 09:03.750
Oh, great. Great.
Couldn't be better.
How about yours?

09:03.750 --> 09:05.120
Uh, amazing.
(chuckles)

09:07.830 --> 09:10.080
So, uh, you're gonna be able
to raise your math grade

09:10.080 --> 09:11.920
without doing any math?

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920
Yep, easy A.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.120
And your project is gonna
put a whooping on Zeena?

09:16.120 --> 09:18.170
-Big-time.
-Okay. Okay.

09:18.170 --> 09:20.000
All right, good.

09:24.170 --> 09:27.170
-Please help me!
-My project stinks!

09:27.170 --> 09:32.210
What? But Mom's fashion career
has to be more exciting
than her Scut job.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.880
Did you know
that there's a color
called light cerulean?

09:36.880 --> 09:39.120
Yeah, it's, like,
a blue, right?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.960
Then just say "blue"!

09:41.960 --> 09:44.000
How did both of our projects
turn out so boring?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.790
I don't know.
Let's just hope

09:45.790 --> 09:48.120
that everybody else's
projects are just as boring.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.790
Yeah, I heard
The Guntz's mom
is a baker.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.120
I mean, that sounds
like a recipe for boring.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.960
Yeah.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.040
Your mom's cannolis

09:57.040 --> 09:59.120
are like a creamy
cloud of heaven

09:59.120 --> 10:01.120
tucked into a fried angel wing.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.960
And for
my presentation
tomorrow,

10:03.960 --> 10:07.170
I'm also gonna show a clip
of my mom winning
Pastry Chef Throwdown,

10:07.170 --> 10:10.000
where yo not only have
to out-bake your opponents,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.830
you have
to out-wrestle them!

10:11.830 --> 10:14.040
Guntz's mom
is pretty jacked.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.000
Cannolis and wrestling.
Nobody could have seen
that coming.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.170
That doesn't mean
that Zeena's project
is gonna be any good.

10:22.170 --> 10:24.830
All:
Woo!

10:26.000 --> 10:27.170
Sounds like
it's not that great.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.170
My dad is a Polynesian
dance instructor.

10:34.210 --> 10:36.250
(Polynesian music playing)

10:45.080 --> 10:48.210
So, you're just gonna show
a video tomorrow, right?

10:48.210 --> 10:50.250
Oh, no.
That was my brother.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.920
He's gonna come in,
and we're gonna do
a live performance,

10:52.920 --> 10:56.380
fire knife, uli uli,
the whole bit.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.920
-Of course you are.
-(laughing)

11:03.250 --> 11:05.210
I'm so over her uli uli.

11:05.210 --> 11:07.960
Okay, don't overreact.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.040
Their projects may be
better than ours,

11:10.040 --> 11:12.290
way, way, way better,

11:12.290 --> 11:15.120
but it's not like
people are gonna be
laughing at us.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.290
(all laughing)

11:24.920 --> 11:25.960
What did you see?

11:27.880 --> 11:29.290
People are gonna be
laughing at us.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.330
I feel so cerulean right now.

11:34.330 --> 11:36.290
Just say "blue."

11:43.960 --> 11:47.120
Okay, okay.
Point two-nine...

11:48.250 --> 11:51.290
times 26

11:51.290 --> 11:53.290
equals...

11:53.290 --> 11:54.960
one.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.120
More answer I don't know.

12:00.290 --> 12:04.420
-Booker, we need
to solve this problem.
-Yes! Yes, thank you!

12:04.420 --> 12:07.420
Then, um...
Then all the other problems
on the page too.

12:07.420 --> 12:11.290
-Let's start--
-Not your homework.
Our projects, okay?

12:11.290 --> 12:14.170
We need to join forces
and figure this out.

12:15.290 --> 12:17.120
Are those The Guntz's
mom's cannolis?

12:18.120 --> 12:19.330
They were all
I could think about.

12:20.290 --> 12:23.210
She also made eclairs
and napoleons.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.380
The Guntz's house is like
a cream-filled paradise.

12:26.380 --> 12:29.120
I never wanted to leave.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.290
I don't get it.
Our mom has two jobs.

12:32.290 --> 12:34.330
Why can't at least one of them
be cream-filled?

12:34.330 --> 12:37.330
-Yes!
-What?

12:37.330 --> 12:41.290
This cannoli just won
a gold medal in bobsledding.
Wanna see?

12:45.170 --> 12:47.120
Wait. Wait.
That's it.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.290
If Levi's greenscreen app
can make a cannoli look
exciting,

12:50.290 --> 12:53.000
we can use it
to make Mom's jobs
look exciting.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.330
Or give her new ones.

12:55.330 --> 12:58.000
♪ ♪

12:59.500 --> 13:01.210
Mom's coming!

13:03.330 --> 13:06.420
Yes!

13:06.420 --> 13:08.420
Finished my power walk.

13:08.420 --> 13:11.250
Now, it's time
for my power nap.

13:12.170 --> 13:16.210
-(grunting)
-What you doing, Booker?

13:16.210 --> 13:19.080
The curtain rod fell
and rolled all the way
over here.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.330
That seems impossible.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.000
I know, right?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.170
Anyway, I've been trying
to hang it back up,

13:31.170 --> 13:33.170
but it's just so darn heavy.

13:35.210 --> 13:37.120
You got
your daddy's muscles.

13:38.210 --> 13:40.250
It's okay, sweetheart.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.380
I got you.

13:41.380 --> 13:42.420
(clears throat)

13:47.250 --> 13:49.420
Oh, yeah!

13:51.380 --> 13:53.210
That's not too heavy
for you, Mom?

13:53.210 --> 13:55.210
It's not heavy at all.
Light as a feather.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.080
Perfect.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.210
Mom is on her way up.

14:02.210 --> 14:05.040
-Ready, Tess?
-Ready!

14:06.080 --> 14:08.210
Hi, sweetie.
Booker said
you needed my help?

14:08.210 --> 14:10.250
Yeah, I'm supposed
to be watching
Wynia's dog for her

14:10.250 --> 14:12.250
while she runs
a couple errands.

14:12.250 --> 14:15.170
But, um, he wants to play,
and I think I'm allergic.
(sneezes)

14:15.170 --> 14:19.120
Oh, okay. Well, it's okay.
I'll watch the little cutie.
What's his name?

14:19.120 --> 14:21.290
His name is Bull,
and he loves this game

14:21.290 --> 14:23.420
where you wear this beret
and neck scarf

14:23.420 --> 14:25.460
as you run,
and he chases you

14:25.460 --> 14:28.420
while you say,
"Bull can't catch me."
Wanna try?

14:28.420 --> 14:31.250
That's oddly specific,
sweetheart.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.500
-But, um, sure,
I'll do it.
-Okay.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.330
-Bull can't catch me!
-(Bull growls)

14:39.330 --> 14:41.170
-Bull can't catch me!
-(Bull barking)

14:41.170 --> 14:43.250
Bull can't catch me!

14:43.250 --> 14:44.500
Bull can't catch me!

14:44.500 --> 14:46.080
Nia: He's loving t.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.250
Bull can't catch me!

14:48.080 --> 14:50.080
Bull can't catch me!

14:53.120 --> 14:56.330
Why are you smearing
your mom's favorite jam
on the counter?

14:56.330 --> 14:58.290
You know what?

14:58.290 --> 15:00.620
Don't tell me.
I wanna be surprised.

15:00.620 --> 15:03.460
Quiet. Here she comes.

15:04.460 --> 15:07.540
Hey, Mom,
will you settle an argument
between me and Levi?

15:07.540 --> 15:09.460
Yeah, sure.
He's smarter.
You're prettier.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.120
Anything else?

15:11.120 --> 15:13.170
Do you like this music?

15:13.170 --> 15:15.290
-Oh.
-(dance music playing)

15:15.290 --> 15:18.170
I like that.
(laughing)
I like...

15:18.170 --> 15:20.290
Hey! What's this
all over my counter?

15:20.290 --> 15:21.330
Y'all see this?

15:22.330 --> 15:24.380
This is my favorite jam!

15:25.460 --> 15:26.620
Hey, uh, what's that?

15:26.620 --> 15:30.120
I said,
"This is my favorite jam!"

15:30.120 --> 15:32.460
Oh, it's sticky, sticky,
sticky, sticky.

15:36.210 --> 15:38.580
And... done.

15:40.250 --> 15:43.540
Booker (on video):
In a sea of amazing parents,

15:43.540 --> 15:46.420
one mom arises
above the rest.

15:46.420 --> 15:49.380
She's not only
a professional weight lifter.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.380
No, not heavy at all.
Light as a feather.

15:51.380 --> 15:54.250
Booker (on video):
She also writes books
on exotic thrill-seeking.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.540
Bull can't catch me!

15:55.540 --> 15:59.420
Booker (on video):
And she's the greatest DJ
of her g-g-generation.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.580
This is my favorite jam!

16:01.580 --> 16:03.250
Sticky, sticky, sticky, sticky.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.250
Booker (on video):
Our mom, Raven Baxter,

16:05.250 --> 16:07.500
is the most interesting mom
in the world.

16:08.420 --> 16:11.540
Both:
And we appreciate her for it.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.500
-We did it!
-Yes! We did it!

16:14.500 --> 16:18.500
Hey! Break it down!
Work it out! Hey!
What we celebrating?

16:18.500 --> 16:20.380
We finished our video,

16:20.380 --> 16:22.540
and it's amazing.

16:22.540 --> 16:25.380
-I wanna see it!
-You wanna what now?

16:25.380 --> 16:28.540
-I wanna see it.
-What-What...
You don't need to see it,

16:28.540 --> 16:32.420
-because you...
you lived it.
-Yeah.

16:32.420 --> 16:36.250
You know what?
You're right.
I don't need to see it.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.210
I'm gonna wait and enjoy it
like everybody else
in class tomorrow.

16:39.210 --> 16:42.250
-All: What?
-You didn't think I was gonna
miss your presentation, did you?

16:42.250 --> 16:45.210
-(stammers)
-But, Mom, no other
parents are coming.

16:45.210 --> 16:48.210
Then you should
consider yourselves lucky.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.290
I can't wait
for tomorrow.

16:54.420 --> 16:57.210
You guys are
in quite a... quite a jam.

16:57.580 --> 17:00.540
It's sticky,
sticky, sticky.

17:00.540 --> 17:03.420
Are you guys proud
of yourselves?

17:03.420 --> 17:05.250
-Yep.
-Little bit.

17:13.250 --> 17:15.250
All right, did you guys
make fake Scut requests,

17:15.250 --> 17:17.420
so Mom'll be too busy driving
to make it to our presentation?

17:17.420 --> 17:20.580
-No, but Mark Gerbler did.
-Who's Mark Gerbler?

17:20.580 --> 17:24.750
I made him up.
But he lives in Skokie
and wants to go to the zoo.

17:24.750 --> 17:28.460
And Captain Meryl
Von ThirstinQuencher
of Oak Park

17:28.460 --> 17:30.420
has a very important
meeting uptown.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.420
Weird but effective.

17:32.670 --> 17:35.500
Just make sure
you guys keep up
your end of the bargain.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.500
Fine, you can have
Nia's cannoli.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.330
And mine.

17:47.330 --> 17:50.620
(Polynesian music playing)

18:04.620 --> 18:06.290
(music ends)

18:09.710 --> 18:11.460
Thank you.

18:12.620 --> 18:15.500
My father is
a Polynesian
dance instructor,

18:15.500 --> 18:19.540
and I appreciate that
he passed on these traditions
to me and my brother.

18:19.540 --> 18:21.380
Thank you.

18:23.290 --> 18:24.620
You hear that, Gabriel?

18:24.620 --> 18:26.750
Someone appreciates
her father.

18:28.380 --> 18:30.670
All right, Booker and Nia,
you're up next.

18:34.580 --> 18:38.540
Booker (on video):
In a sea of amazing parents,

18:38.540 --> 18:41.380
one mom arises above the rest.

18:41.380 --> 18:43.580
She's not only
a professional weight lifter...

18:43.580 --> 18:45.500
Bull can't catch me!

18:45.500 --> 18:48.710
Booker (on video):
And she's the greatest DJ
of her g-g-generation.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.670
No, not heavy at all.
Light as a feather.

18:51.670 --> 18:55.380
Booker (on video):
She also writes books
on exotic thrill-seeking.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.540
This is my favorite jam!

18:57.540 --> 18:59.670
Sticky, sticky, sticky, sticky.

18:59.670 --> 19:01.540
(laughing)

19:07.380 --> 19:08.710
This was my vision.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.540
What happened?

19:10.540 --> 19:12.750
Uh, Mr. Patel,
can we please
have a moment

19:12.750 --> 19:15.540
to sort out
our technical difficulties?

19:15.540 --> 19:17.750
If that's what you're
calling them, sure.

19:22.420 --> 19:23.790
Something must have
happened to our video

19:23.790 --> 19:25.880
when we transferred it
from Levi's phone.
Call him.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.580
Okay.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.710
Hey, wait.
I have a voicemail
from Mom.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.580
Why don't I have
a voicemail from Mom?

19:32.580 --> 19:35.420
Aw, really?
We gonna do this now?

19:35.420 --> 19:36.790
Face it.

19:36.790 --> 19:39.420
I'm her go-to guy.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.460
Raven (on voicemail):
Booker, I couldn't get
through to Nia,

19:41.460 --> 19:42.710
so make sure
she hears this.

19:42.710 --> 19:43.790
Huh.

19:48.540 --> 19:50.460
Really?

19:50.460 --> 19:52.500
You let The Guntz go
while we were in the hall?

19:52.500 --> 19:54.790
Don't worry.
We saved you
some cann--

19:54.790 --> 19:56.420
Gabriel!

19:57.750 --> 20:00.580
Anyway, did you fix
your presentation?

20:00.580 --> 20:03.790
Actually, we did.

20:03.790 --> 20:07.460
And it's not fancy,
but we're proud of it.

20:07.460 --> 20:11.420
-Does it come with dessert?
-What part of "not fancy"
didn't you understand, Curtis?

20:12.750 --> 20:14.580
Anyway...

20:14.580 --> 20:16.460
we made that fake video

20:16.460 --> 20:19.420
because we thought
our mom's job was boring.

20:19.420 --> 20:21.580
But after we heard
what just happened to her,

20:21.580 --> 20:23.790
we realize that
her job isn't boring at all.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.790
You see, a little while ago,
she was driving her Scut...

20:28.620 --> 20:30.670
Okay, is any one of you

20:30.670 --> 20:33.670
Captain Meryl
Von ThirstinQuencher
from Oak Park?

20:36.460 --> 20:38.500
(app ringing)

20:38.500 --> 20:41.500
Oh, hopefully, this person
doesn't cancel on me.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.710
Hello, my name is Raven.

20:45.710 --> 20:48.620
I will be
your Scut driver...

20:49.830 --> 20:51.670
Hey.

20:51.670 --> 20:52.830
What's your name?

20:52.830 --> 20:56.460
-Andrew.
-Hi, Andrew.

20:56.460 --> 20:58.830
Uh, you know,
you seem a little young

20:58.830 --> 21:00.540
to be riding in a Scut
by yourself.

21:00.540 --> 21:01.620
Where are your parents?

21:01.620 --> 21:02.790
At home.

21:02.790 --> 21:05.830
I'm going to my grandma's.
It's more fun there.

21:05.830 --> 21:08.790
She lets me put
chocolate milk
in my cereal.

21:08.790 --> 21:11.880
Ooh! Grandma
living on the edge!

21:13.920 --> 21:16.000
So...

21:16.000 --> 21:18.830
So, how long
do you plan on staying
at your grandma's for?

21:18.830 --> 21:21.830
-Ever.
-That's a long time.

21:21.830 --> 21:25.500
Yeah, well, ever since
my baby sister came home,

21:25.500 --> 21:26.670
it's all about her.

21:26.670 --> 21:29.540
"Turn your video game down.
You'll wake the baby."

21:29.540 --> 21:30.920
"Don't cough near the baby."

21:30.920 --> 21:33.880
"Don't use that language
in front of the baby."

21:33.880 --> 21:36.540
Sounds like that baby
is out to get you.

21:36.540 --> 21:39.670
Taking all your parents' time
and attention away from you.

21:39.670 --> 21:42.540
-She is.
-And running away

21:42.540 --> 21:44.540
to go live with your grandma,
that'll show them!

21:44.540 --> 21:46.540
-Sure will.
-Yeah, it will.

21:46.540 --> 21:48.830
That way, you never have to see
your annoying baby sister again,

21:48.830 --> 21:50.540
your friends...

21:50.540 --> 21:52.750
I don't know.
Your dog if you have one.

21:52.750 --> 21:56.540
-I do. Kirby.
-Yep, never see him again.

21:56.540 --> 22:00.040
And of course,
your parents won't be able
to spend much time with you

22:00.040 --> 22:01.790
if you live
at your grandma's.

22:01.790 --> 22:04.790
-They won't?
-No.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.750
I...

22:08.750 --> 22:10.620
I think I wanna go home.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.710
Well, good thing
we never left.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.580
-You're good.
-I know I'm good.

22:17.580 --> 22:18.960
I'm a mom.
That's what we do.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.880
Come on.
I'll walk you to the door.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.920
-I wanna meet Kirby.
-Thanks.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.710
Hey! Hey! Don't forget
to give me a good rating.

22:27.710 --> 22:29.920
So, even though
our mom's jobs
may seem boring...

22:29.920 --> 22:32.880
Like when
she's designing an outfit
and debates a color choice

22:32.880 --> 22:34.920
for hours, and hours, and hours.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.750
Or when she's picking up
Scut passengers

22:37.750 --> 22:42.670
and dropping them off
for hours, and hours,
and hours.

22:42.670 --> 22:44.750
It's all those little,
boring details

22:44.750 --> 22:47.580
that, um, are
the building blocks
for success.

22:47.580 --> 22:51.790
Today, that attention to detail
helped our mom notice
a pillow in a backpack.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.080
And that boring detail
saved a kid from making
a big mistake.

22:56.080 --> 23:00.620
Sometimes, as kids,
all we appreciate is
the flashy, exciting stuff

23:00.620 --> 23:02.080
when we should
really appreciate

23:02.080 --> 23:03.920
all the hard work
it took to get there.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.920
So, today,
we appreciate our mom.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.960
And we couldn't be
more proud of her.

23:15.620 --> 23:17.080
(sniffling)

23:17.080 --> 23:19.670
You hear that, Gabriel?

23:19.670 --> 23:20.960
(snoring)

23:20.960 --> 23:22.040
Mr. Patel:
Gabriel?

23:25.670 --> 23:27.710
He heard it.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.710
(whispering):
He didn't hear it.

23:30.830 --> 23:32.620
But I did.
