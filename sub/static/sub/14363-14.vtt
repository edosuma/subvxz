WEBVTT

00:05.571 --> 00:07.171
Previously on "The Middle"..

00:07.172 --> 00:09.273
Wow, Darrin, you're a homeowner.

00:09.274 --> 00:10.608
Congratulations.

00:10.609 --> 00:12.644
Actually, Sue, there's one more surprise.

00:13.712 --> 00:15.347
Sue Heck, will you marry me?

00:19.318 --> 00:22.320
Hey,
what are you doing home on Valentine's day?

00:22.321 --> 00:24.689
Oh, I guess you decided not
to celebrate with Devin?

00:24.690 --> 00:27.191
We "celebrated" last night,
if you know what I mean.

00:27.192 --> 00:29.661
Axl,
no one wants to know what you mean.

00:30.596 --> 00:32.130
I've been thinking about it,

00:32.131 --> 00:34.165
and now that I'm the make-out king...

00:34.166 --> 00:35.800
kissing a hillbilly in North Carolina

00:35.801 --> 00:37.101
and your giraffe of a girlfriend

00:37.102 --> 00:38.803
does not a make-out king make.

00:38.804 --> 00:41.139
I'm sorry, how many different
states have you kissed girls in?

00:41.140 --> 00:43.074
'Cause I'm currently at three.

00:43.075 --> 00:45.777
Brick, it's not very gentlemanly
to brag about your conquests.

00:47.679 --> 00:48.980
The point is, I'm a man now,

00:48.981 --> 00:50.114
and since Cindy and I

00:50.115 --> 00:52.150
have officially taken it to the next level,

00:52.151 --> 00:53.317
I've decided it's time

00:53.318 --> 00:55.653
for me to give up my
childish affectations...

00:55.654 --> 00:57.355
the whoops, the whispers,

00:57.356 --> 00:59.790
eating an entire pencil
over the course of a week.

01:01.693 --> 01:03.995
Hey!
So, did you finally make it

01:03.996 --> 01:06.264
to the end of Darrin's big scavenger hunt?

01:06.265 --> 01:07.665
Yep.

01:07.666 --> 01:08.733
Yep, I did.

01:08.734 --> 01:09.767
Did he get you the red sweater?

01:09.768 --> 01:11.068
'Cause we told him you wanted red.

01:11.069 --> 01:12.303
Nope.

01:12.304 --> 01:13.871
No sweater.

01:13.872 --> 01:16.707
I think I'm just gonna go lie down now.

01:16.708 --> 01:17.909
Anyway,

01:17.910 --> 01:19.810
since deciding to give up
my tics a half-hour ago,

01:19.811 --> 01:21.979
I've whooped five times
and whispered three.

01:21.980 --> 01:23.648
By the way, I'm counting them now,

01:23.649 --> 01:24.749
so I'm scared that might be a new one.

01:24.750 --> 01:25.917
Don't be discouraged, Brick.

01:25.918 --> 01:27.652
Being aware of the problem
is half the battle.

01:27.653 --> 01:28.819
Don't listen to her, Brick.

01:28.820 --> 01:30.721
That's mom speak for "I got nothing."

01:30.722 --> 01:31.989
Fortunately for you,

01:31.990 --> 01:34.025
I'm taking intro to psych this semester,

01:34.026 --> 01:36.928
and we're learning about
this guy named Sigmund Freud.

01:36.929 --> 01:38.996
Uh, you guys might want to
pay attention here, too.

01:39.998 --> 01:41.232
We've heard of Freud, Axl.

01:41.233 --> 01:43.568
Yeah, 'cause I just said it.
Nice try, though.

01:43.569 --> 01:45.002
So, this Freud guy,

01:45.003 --> 01:46.604
he had the hots for his own mom.

01:47.606 --> 01:48.839
But it's all good

01:48.840 --> 01:51.576
'cause he figured out a way to
turn his perviness into science.

01:51.577 --> 01:52.743
He invented these things

01:52.744 --> 01:55.346
called the ego, the superego, and the I.D.

01:55.347 --> 01:58.049
So, what I'm saying, Brick, is,
I'm pretty sure I can fix you.

01:58.050 --> 01:59.183
Can you fix me by tomorrow?

01:59.184 --> 02:01.018
I'm meeting Cindy at the library at 3:00.

02:01.019 --> 02:02.653
I'd bet my C-plus on it.

02:05.691 --> 02:07.358
I made dinner!

02:07.359 --> 02:10.027
Coming.

02:13.665 --> 02:15.600
Dare we ask?

02:15.601 --> 02:17.201
Oh, this?

02:17.202 --> 02:19.604
Axl swaddled me before
I went back to school.

02:19.605 --> 02:20.905
He said my tics might be caused

02:20.906 --> 02:22.773
because my nerve endings are too exposed,

02:22.774 --> 02:25.643
so he suggested a good
swaddle might comfort me.

02:25.644 --> 02:27.712
I think he might be onto something.

02:27.713 --> 02:29.013
It's very soothing.

02:29.014 --> 02:31.882
Kind of like a... a hug for my psyche.

02:31.883 --> 02:34.119
Sue, would you mind?

02:37.623 --> 02:38.956
Hey, what's that?

02:38.957 --> 02:40.024
Oh. Oh, this?

02:40.025 --> 02:42.093
Oh, it's... it's nothing. It's nothing.

02:42.094 --> 02:43.661
It's just something Darrin got for me.

02:43.662 --> 02:46.282
Mm, wow. First,
he gets you a necklace and now a ring?

02:46.283 --> 02:47.301
What, does he have an account

02:47.302 --> 02:49.367
at pioneer galaxy jewelers?

02:49.368 --> 02:51.536
Don't feel bad, Mike.
I told you, I love my Tweezers.

02:51.537 --> 02:52.603
Nice ring, though.

02:52.604 --> 02:53.938
The diamond thingy almost looks real.

02:55.073 --> 02:56.107
Mm. Let me see.

02:56.108 --> 02:58.709
Mm. Come on.

02:58.710 --> 03:01.279
- Oh, wow, fancy.
- Yeah.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.747
But, geez, doesn't it look

03:02.748 --> 03:04.815
a little too much like an engagement ring?

03:09.955 --> 03:10.988
Mike.

03:10.989 --> 03:12.123
Let me see that.

03:12.124 --> 03:13.357
I don't know how it happened!

03:13.358 --> 03:14.859
Ah, I was just doing the scavenger hunt,

03:14.860 --> 03:16.627
and then suddenly he gets down on his knee,

03:16.628 --> 03:17.628
and there was a tiny house,

03:17.629 --> 03:19.196
and I think he might have
asked me to marry him!

03:19.197 --> 03:20.665
What? You think he what?!

03:20.666 --> 03:22.066
She said "might."
She thinks he might have asked.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.134
No, he did. He definitely did.

03:23.135 --> 03:24.201
- Whoop!
- Oh, my God.

03:24.202 --> 03:25.202
Oh, my God!

03:25.203 --> 03:27.038
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Kill him.

03:27.039 --> 03:28.239
Uh-oh.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.974
I've never whispered someone
else's sentence before.

03:29.975 --> 03:31.108
That's concerning!

03:31.109 --> 03:32.743
So, Darrin actually asked you to marry him,

03:32.744 --> 03:34.145
and you're telling me you said yes?

03:34.146 --> 03:35.480
No, I didn't. I definitely didn't.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.028
- What did you say, then?
- I said, "sure."

03:37.029 --> 03:38.616
- "Sure"?!
- Oh, my God, she said "sure"!

03:38.617 --> 03:39.784
Yeah, but not like a "yes, sure,"

03:39.785 --> 03:42.286
like a casual, like,
you know, like, "sure, sure."

03:42.287 --> 03:44.322
I didn't think he'd think I meant "sure!"

03:44.323 --> 03:46.724
How the hell could this happen?!
Would you let her talk?

03:46.725 --> 03:47.825
I didn't know what to do.

03:47.826 --> 03:49.927
I just felt bad
'cause he bought me a tiny house and I...

03:49.928 --> 03:52.063
- He bought you a house?!
- Stop yelling!

03:52.064 --> 03:53.130
Hey, you want me yelling.

03:53.131 --> 03:54.298
Every minute I'm yelling

03:54.299 --> 03:55.633
is a minute I'm not killing her boyfriend.

03:55.634 --> 03:56.934
Stop it... we're not killing anyone,

03:56.935 --> 03:58.903
- not until we have all the facts.
- Facts.

03:58.904 --> 03:59.970
Damn it. Did it again.

03:59.971 --> 04:01.238
Oh, that's new.

04:01.239 --> 04:03.341
Apparently, in addition to whispering,
I'm cursing now.

04:03.342 --> 04:04.742
I am so sorry!

04:04.743 --> 04:06.877
I don't know how any of this happened!

04:06.878 --> 04:08.112
Well, you got to know.

04:08.113 --> 04:10.114
You're not a little kid playing Barbies,
Sue.

04:10.115 --> 04:11.849
A man has asked you to marry him.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.884
Do you understand the
situation you're in here?

04:13.885 --> 04:16.654
Uh, maybe it would just
be easier to get married.

04:16.654 --> 04:17.988
Are you nuts?!

04:17.988 --> 04:20.291
Marriage is hard!
We just make it look easy!

04:20.291 --> 04:22.626
I don't know! I don't know anything, okay?

04:22.627 --> 04:23.861
I am confused.

04:23.862 --> 04:25.196
I just need to be alone.

04:25.197 --> 04:27.065
Uh, I just need time to think, okay?!

04:32.571 --> 04:33.872
Could somebody please tighten my swaddle?

04:35.883 --> 04:37.072
What's the holdup?

04:37.073 --> 04:38.575
What's she need to be
thinking about in there?

04:38.576 --> 04:40.983
I'm gonna go in there and
tell her what she's thinking.

04:40.984 --> 04:42.344
You can't do that, Mike.

04:42.345 --> 04:44.286
You go in there and
start badmouthing Darrin,

04:44.287 --> 04:46.676
you're just gonna drive her
right into his beefy arms.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.175
It's your fault, you know.

04:48.176 --> 04:49.344
I been telling you all along

04:49.345 --> 04:50.552
we got to watch out for this dummy,

04:50.553 --> 04:53.161
but you kept saying, "no, don't worry.
It's just Darrin."

04:53.162 --> 04:54.640
"He's harmless."

04:54.641 --> 04:56.130
- Well...
- Oh, please.

04:56.131 --> 04:58.031
Since when do you listen to anything I say?

04:58.032 --> 05:00.400
Don't act like I'm suddenly
the boss around here.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.968
Yeah, well,
somebody took their eye off the ball.

05:02.969 --> 05:06.744
Yeah, look,
what does it matter who said what?

05:06.745 --> 05:08.945
Our teenage daughter has a
ring on her finger...

05:08.946 --> 05:10.257
And it's both our faults.

05:10.258 --> 05:12.129
And you know why that is?

05:12.130 --> 05:13.520
'Cause we suck.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.200
We're lazy parents, and we suck.

05:16.799 --> 05:19.260
Guys? I've been in my room thinking,

05:19.261 --> 05:22.300
and the truth is,
I don't want to marry Darrin.

05:22.301 --> 05:24.140
Oh, thank God!

05:24.141 --> 05:25.397
We don't suck.

05:25.398 --> 05:26.885
Oh, my God. We're good, Mike.

05:26.886 --> 05:28.020
We're good, good parents.

05:28.021 --> 05:29.464
I can't be engaged now.

05:29.465 --> 05:32.583
I mean,
I'm not ready for anything like that.

05:32.584 --> 05:35.280
But it's, you know,

05:35.281 --> 05:36.952
it's really hard.

05:36.953 --> 05:39.139
- Well, of course it's hard.
- Oh, it's not that hard.

05:39.140 --> 05:41.447
And I do really love him.

05:41.448 --> 05:43.061
- Of course you do.
- Of course you think you do.

05:43.062 --> 05:45.740
I mean, mom,
you should've seen him.

05:45.741 --> 05:49.805
He got down on one knee, and he
looked up at me, and he did the thing

05:49.806 --> 05:52.154
where his eyebrows go up when he's hopeful.

05:52.155 --> 05:54.779
And then he said
"will you marry me?"

05:54.780 --> 05:57.554
Aw. And it was so cute,
and he was so happy,

05:57.555 --> 05:59.724
and now I have to tell him I don't want to,

05:59.725 --> 06:01.213
and I don't even know how you say that.

06:01.214 --> 06:04.129
I got a couple phrases I
think will do the trick.

06:05.297 --> 06:08.090
I think what your dad means is,
you just need to be honest with him.

06:09.609 --> 06:11.274
I know.

06:11.275 --> 06:13.431
You're right. You're totally right.

06:13.432 --> 06:14.942
I know that's what I have to do.

06:14.943 --> 06:16.679
I just have to go over there

06:16.680 --> 06:18.622
and try not to look at his eyebrows

06:18.623 --> 06:19.742
and just tell him

06:19.743 --> 06:23.546
my "yes, sure" was really
more of a "no, sure."

06:23.547 --> 06:24.674
You want me to go with you?

06:24.675 --> 06:26.514
I'd be happy to go over there

06:26.515 --> 06:28.625
and personally make sure that he gets it.

06:28.626 --> 06:30.594
Hell, we can go right now,

06:30.595 --> 06:32.222
or I can just go.

06:32.223 --> 06:33.455
Aw, dad.

06:33.456 --> 06:37.110
That is so sweet,
but I am gonna be 18 in two weeks.

06:37.111 --> 06:40.031
I am too old to have my
daddy fix my problems.

06:40.032 --> 06:43.704
I'm the one who said "sure."
I'm the one who has to do it.

06:46.632 --> 06:49.279
You mind if I sleep in
here with you guys tonight?

06:49.280 --> 06:51.294
Oh, of course you can.

06:51.295 --> 06:53.578
Are you hungry?
You didn't eat much at dinner.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.710
Kind of.

06:54.711 --> 06:57.798
What do you want... sweet or salty?

06:57.799 --> 06:59.825
Ooh.  Both.

06:59.826 --> 07:01.493
That night, Sue slept in our bed

07:01.494 --> 07:04.796
for the first time since
she was a little girl,

07:04.797 --> 07:06.365
but the next day,

07:06.366 --> 07:09.434
it was time for her to
step up and be a woman.

07:09.435 --> 07:11.837
Hey, there's my fiancée.

07:11.838 --> 07:13.505
I'm glad you're here.

07:13.506 --> 07:16.341
I'm just trying to figure out
how to fit all my stuff in the house.

07:16.342 --> 07:18.377
Of course, I'm gonna leave
space for your stuff, too.

07:18.378 --> 07:19.411
Yeah, about that...

07:19.412 --> 07:20.979
Darrin, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

07:20.980 --> 07:24.240
Honestly, I couldn't have been
more thrilled and flattered

07:24.241 --> 07:25.337
when you proposed to me.

07:25.338 --> 07:27.633
Oh, I know. I've never seen that
look on your face before.

07:27.634 --> 07:30.780
Oh, and I don't mean to step
on the toes of the bride-to-be,

07:30.781 --> 07:34.054
but I booked a DJ and put a
soft hold on the VFW hall.

07:34.055 --> 07:35.517
Unless you want to consider

07:35.518 --> 07:37.322
the business center at the cozy suites.

07:37.323 --> 07:38.414
What do you think?

07:38.415 --> 07:40.883
VFW's fine, but here's the thing...

07:40.884 --> 07:42.043
Darrin, honestly,

07:42.044 --> 07:43.587
I couldn't have been more
thrilled and flattered

07:43.588 --> 07:45.897
when you proposed to me,
but I am still in high school.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.908
I mean,
I don't even graduate until June 5th...

07:47.909 --> 07:48.671
Oh, don't worry.

07:48.672 --> 07:51.667
The hold I put at the VFW hall
is for the 6th... a Saturday.

07:51.668 --> 07:53.940
Or would you rather have it on the Sunday?

07:53.941 --> 07:55.340
Saturday works,

07:55.341 --> 07:56.772
but listen... Darrin, honestly,

07:56.773 --> 07:58.173
I couldn't have been more
thrilled and flattered

07:58.174 --> 07:59.606
when you proposed to me,
but here's the thing...

08:01.850 --> 08:02.922
Oh, boy.

08:04.991 --> 08:07.087
Uh... uh, Darrin, honestly,

08:07.088 --> 08:08.444
I couldn't have been more
flattered and thrilled

08:08.445 --> 08:10.145
- when you proposed to me, but...
- What are you doing?

08:10.146 --> 08:12.873
S-sometimes I just like to
talk with my back to people.

08:12.874 --> 08:14.993
Sue.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.585
I know you're a little stressed

08:16.586 --> 08:18.009
'cause there's a million details,

08:18.010 --> 08:19.826
but you don't need to worry about this one.

08:19.827 --> 08:21.721
For our honeymoon,

08:21.722 --> 08:23.682
I'm taking you to Weeki Wachee, Florida,

08:23.683 --> 08:24.741
to see the Mermaids.

08:24.742 --> 08:26.674
I want to start our life together

08:26.675 --> 08:28.638
by giving you everything
you've ever wanted.

08:28.639 --> 08:30.090
So, what do you think, Sue?

08:30.091 --> 08:31.851
Florida for our honeymoon?

08:34.436 --> 08:35.875
Sure.

08:42.820 --> 08:44.721
Night.

08:44.722 --> 08:45.755
Brick?

08:45.756 --> 08:47.790
What's with the rubber band?

08:47.791 --> 08:50.226
Oh, Axl told me whenever
I feel the urge to whoop

08:50.227 --> 08:52.095
to just snap the rubber band instead.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.697
It was kind of annoying at first,
but now I kind of like it.

08:54.698 --> 08:56.833
So much,
it's possible it's become a new tic.

08:56.834 --> 08:58.267
Night.

08:58.268 --> 09:00.203
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Get in here.

09:00.204 --> 09:02.672
How'd it go? How did he take it?

09:02.673 --> 09:04.040
Right. Okay. Here's the thing...

09:04.041 --> 09:05.608
- You didn't do it.
- Sue!

09:05.609 --> 09:07.243
I'm sorry. I-I tried.

09:07.244 --> 09:08.911
It's just, he did the eyebrow thing again,

09:08.912 --> 09:10.914
a-and if you saw it, you'd know.
It's really hard.

09:11.982 --> 09:14.163
No, no, no! No snugglebed for you.

09:14.164 --> 09:15.443
- Oh, please! Please! Please!
- We gave you snugglebed

09:15.444 --> 09:17.515
last time, and it led to nothing.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.276
No! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

09:19.277 --> 09:20.890
What the hell is going on?!

09:20.891 --> 09:23.593
Why is Darrin calling me
asking me to be his best man?

09:23.594 --> 09:25.662
'Cause apparently your
sister's getting married.

09:25.663 --> 09:26.696
And you two guys

09:26.697 --> 09:28.364
are just sitting here letting this happen?

09:28.365 --> 09:29.766
Why aren't you stopping this?!

09:29.767 --> 09:31.334
My God,
I have to do everything around here.

09:31.335 --> 09:32.969
I have to fix the sink,
I have to fix the Brick,

09:32.970 --> 09:34.037
now I got to fix the Sue?

09:34.038 --> 09:36.139
You are not getting married, all right?!

09:36.140 --> 09:37.573
You've got too many
dorky dreams to fulfill!

09:37.574 --> 09:38.775
I know, Axl!

09:38.776 --> 09:40.243
I don't want to get married!

09:40.244 --> 09:42.045
See?
I've been saying this the whole time...

09:42.046 --> 09:43.913
this Darrin thing was a trainwreck,

09:43.914 --> 09:46.282
but you guys are all like,
"oh, he's harmless.

09:46.283 --> 09:47.583
"Be supportive of your sister.

09:47.584 --> 09:49.652
Stop making vomit noises
when you see them together."

09:49.653 --> 09:51.154
Okay, who's really to blame here?

09:51.155 --> 09:53.589
You're the one that brought
Darrin home for a play date

09:53.590 --> 09:54.590
when you were 4.

09:54.591 --> 09:55.958
I didn't even like him back then,

09:55.959 --> 09:57.694
but you said,
"you better find something to like

09:57.695 --> 09:59.629
'cause I like Mrs. McGrew."

09:59.630 --> 10:01.164
Oh, my God.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.699
Her name is gonna be "Sue Sue McGrew."

10:03.934 --> 10:06.202
Nice parenting.

10:06.203 --> 10:07.270
Classic.

10:07.271 --> 10:09.138
Tension's a trigger.
It's getting worse, Axl.

10:09.139 --> 10:10.173
Just keep snapping, Brick.

10:10.174 --> 10:11.641
I'm juggling a million balls here.

10:11.642 --> 10:13.109
Look, I will handle this, okay?

10:13.110 --> 10:15.355
It's just that
Darrin is not making it easy.

10:15.356 --> 10:17.006
There are a lot of dynamics at play here,
Axl,

10:17.007 --> 10:17.904
that you are not aware of,

10:17.905 --> 10:20.176
dynamics that involve soft holds on hotels

10:20.177 --> 10:21.624
and eyebrows and Mermaids...

10:21.625 --> 10:22.976
He's not making it easy?

10:22.977 --> 10:24.187
That's it... I'm gonna go kill him.

10:24.188 --> 10:27.273
Hey, I'm the dad. If anyone
gets to kill him, it's me.

10:27.274 --> 10:29.143
Oh, no. You had your
chance, and you blew it.

10:29.144 --> 10:30.633
Oh, no, I didn't take my
chance yet. I still...

10:30.634 --> 10:32.231
No, no, listen.
Nobody's killing anybody.

10:32.232 --> 10:31.758
Yeah, well, you should've
taken your chance.

10:31.759 --> 10:33.440
You had the... hey, hey, stop it! Stop it!

10:33.441 --> 10:35.792
Nobody is doing anything.

10:35.793 --> 10:38.608
In less than two weeks,
I am going to be 18.

10:38.609 --> 10:40.888
That is old enough to get my ears pierced

10:40.889 --> 10:42.632
without a signed note from my parents.

10:42.633 --> 10:43.904
I can do this.

10:43.905 --> 10:47.026
Please promise me you
will let me handle this.

10:49.793 --> 10:51.720
Thank you.

10:51.721 --> 10:53.896
Whoa-ho-ho, hold it, sister!

10:53.897 --> 10:55.793
You'll snuggle when the deed is done.

10:56.369 --> 10:58.632
Okay.

11:00.004 --> 11:02.249
Hello, sir. May I come in?

11:02.893 --> 11:04.127
It's your funeral.

11:04.128 --> 11:05.895
Good one.

11:05.896 --> 11:07.631
I love your humor.

11:10.567 --> 11:12.669
I had something I wanted
to talk to you about.

11:14.038 --> 11:16.639
Mr. Heck, I know I might've done
things a little out of order,

11:16.640 --> 11:18.641
but I wanted that element of surprise.

11:18.642 --> 11:20.143
I hope you can understand that.

11:20.144 --> 11:22.845
But I'm a sucker for tradition,
so here goes.

11:22.846 --> 11:25.615
Sir, I love your daughter

11:25.616 --> 11:27.517
more than anything in the whole world,

11:27.518 --> 11:29.585
so I would be honored

11:29.586 --> 11:31.988
if you were to give me
her hand in marriage.

11:31.989 --> 11:33.490
No.

11:35.926 --> 11:37.093
Okay, I get it...

11:37.094 --> 11:39.195
you're giving me a hard time,
making me sweat.

11:39.196 --> 11:40.730
I guess I expected that.

11:40.731 --> 11:42.732
- But listen, dad, I know...
- Listen who?!

11:42.733 --> 11:44.600
Too early for
the "dad" thing. Got it.

11:44.601 --> 11:45.968
Uh, uh, the point is,

11:45.969 --> 11:48.071
Sue and I are super-psyched
about our future together...

11:48.072 --> 11:50.540
Actually, Darrin, about that...
the thing is, Sue isn't...

11:50.541 --> 11:51.541
Mike?

11:51.542 --> 11:53.009
Do you want cheese on your burger?

11:53.010 --> 11:54.610
I always leave that decision up to you

11:54.611 --> 11:56.512
because you're the one eating the burger,

11:56.513 --> 11:57.547
so it's not really my place

11:57.548 --> 11:58.815
to tell you how your burger should be,

11:58.816 --> 11:59.882
- you know, espec...
- I get it.

11:59.883 --> 12:01.718
- Cheese.
- Okay.

12:03.220 --> 12:04.987
You know what, Darrin?

12:04.988 --> 12:06.255
You don't need my blessing.

12:06.256 --> 12:07.257
You only need Sue's.

12:08.525 --> 12:09.792
She already said yes.

12:09.793 --> 12:12.096
Well, you might want to check on that.

12:17.968 --> 12:19.035
Oh!

12:19.036 --> 12:20.470
Oh, hey, Darrin.

12:20.471 --> 12:21.637
Hey, Sue.

12:21.638 --> 12:23.806
Can I talk to you for a second?

12:23.807 --> 12:25.608
"Sure"?!

12:25.609 --> 12:27.777
Not my fault. It... it's dad's fault.

12:27.778 --> 12:29.545
You... after dad talked to him,

12:29.546 --> 12:31.114
he thought maybe I
didn't want to marry him.

12:31.115 --> 12:32.615
You don't.

12:32.616 --> 12:34.984
I know! And I had a whole plan
of how I was gonna tell him,

12:34.985 --> 12:38.470
but then he showed up and it threw me
'cause he was all sad.

12:38.471 --> 12:40.389
- And he did the eyebr...
- Don't you say "eyebrows," Sue.

12:40.390 --> 12:42.324
I swear I'll go over
there and shave them off!

12:42.325 --> 12:44.051
I just didn't know what to say.

12:44.052 --> 12:45.635
You say no.

12:45.636 --> 12:47.356
I set it up for you perfectly.

12:47.357 --> 12:49.232
Then you come back with another "sure"?

12:49.233 --> 12:50.716
It was hard, okay?

12:50.717 --> 12:52.643
It was in front of the trash.

12:52.644 --> 12:54.622
Our first kiss was in front of the trash.

12:54.623 --> 12:56.139
He even wrote me a song about it.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.780
Well,
the next song he's gonna be writing is

12:57.781 --> 13:00.154
"Who's that Giant Guy at my Door?"
'Cause I'm gonna...

13:00.155 --> 13:02.204
No! No. Dad, please.

13:02.205 --> 13:04.190
Promise I can do this.

13:04.191 --> 13:05.958
Okay,
you're getting pretty hard to believe, Sue.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.303
You're the girl who cried, "sure."

13:07.304 --> 13:09.391
Get. It. Done!

13:11.615 --> 13:13.390
It's just so frustrating.

13:13.391 --> 13:16.022
It's been three days, and nothing's worked.

13:16.023 --> 13:17.926
How messed up am I that my brother

13:17.927 --> 13:19.769
who's taking an
"Introduction to Psychology" class

13:19.770 --> 13:20.825
can't fix me?

13:20.826 --> 13:22.369
Brick, three days is nothing.

13:22.370 --> 13:24.400
Some of your more famous
psychological breakthroughs

13:24.401 --> 13:25.625
took up to a week.

13:25.626 --> 13:29.000
Now, what we've been doing so
far are simple band-aid fixes,

13:29.001 --> 13:32.313
but clearly, we need to go deeper...
much deeper.

13:32.314 --> 13:35.273
The question is,
are you willing to do the work?

13:35.274 --> 13:38.177
- I am.
- Cool.

13:38.178 --> 13:41.046
- And remember, this is a safe space.
- Mm.

13:41.047 --> 13:44.297
Now, why are you such a freak,
what made you a freak,

13:44.298 --> 13:45.930
and what's the first
freakish thing you ever did?

13:53.316 --> 13:56.210
There she is,
my future daughter-in-law!

13:59.487 --> 14:02.619
Sue, meet my sister and your new auntie,
Rhonda.

14:02.620 --> 14:05.012
You're gorgeous... absolutely gorgeous.

14:05.013 --> 14:06.761
I'm sorry... I was just looking for Darrin.

14:06.762 --> 14:10.105
Oh, you just missed him,
but you've got perfect timing.

14:10.106 --> 14:12.146
I was just dropping something by.

14:12.147 --> 14:13.154
This!

14:13.572 --> 14:15.227
Oh, wow.

14:15.228 --> 14:16.204
That is just...

14:16.205 --> 14:17.787
Wow.

14:17.788 --> 14:19.259
Now, I don't want to presume anything,

14:19.260 --> 14:20.571
and I completely get it

14:20.572 --> 14:22.180
if you want to pick out a
new dress with your mom,

14:22.181 --> 14:25.218
but every McGrew sister
has worn this dress.

14:25.219 --> 14:26.776
I've worn it three times.

14:27.744 --> 14:28.609
Ooh, try it on.

14:28.610 --> 14:30.701
No, no, no. I just had gym last period,

14:30.702 --> 14:32.102
- so, I'm sweaty.
- Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

14:32.103 --> 14:34.043
- Probably gonna get your dress all dirty.
- No, no, no, no.

14:34.044 --> 14:35.928
- I'm all sweaty.
- Oh, it'll be fine.

14:35.929 --> 14:39.040
Now, Darrin says you picked
out the VFW for your reception.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.969
Well,
everything isn't completely nailed down.

14:40.970 --> 14:43.214
Oh, it's a great space. Have you seen it?

14:43.215 --> 14:44.800
I think I went to a
birthday party there once.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.092
I think they had a pac-man machine.

14:46.093 --> 14:46.951
That's really tight. Oh!

14:46.952 --> 14:49.619
Oh, what is... That? Oh...

14:49.620 --> 14:52.521
Oh, Sue, it looks beautiful.

14:52.522 --> 14:55.258
You're gonna be the
prettiest bride in Orson.

14:55.259 --> 14:56.859
And then come the babies!

14:56.860 --> 14:57.994
Oh!

15:04.336 --> 15:06.932
Mom, dad, get in here! I cured Brick!

15:06.933 --> 15:08.584
What's going on?

15:08.585 --> 15:11.641
I give you a de-freaked Brick Heck.

15:11.642 --> 15:12.815
It wasn't easy.

15:12.816 --> 15:14.281
I had to hit the books pretty hard.

15:14.282 --> 15:15.152
I'm not gonna lie...

15:15.153 --> 15:17.009
I took Brick to some pretty dark places

15:17.010 --> 15:18.960
and he had to face some demons,

15:18.961 --> 15:22.009
but in the end, it all came down...

15:23.089 --> 15:24.305
To this.

15:24.306 --> 15:25.738
The chair?

15:25.739 --> 15:26.945
Not just any chair,

15:26.946 --> 15:28.758
the rickety, rusty lawn chair

15:28.759 --> 15:30.680
you forced Brick to sit in for years.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.960
While we've all sat like kings
in our matching broyhill chairs,

15:33.961 --> 15:35.248
Brick has been forced

15:35.249 --> 15:36.890
to sit in a lawn chair you
pulled out of the backyard.

15:36.891 --> 15:39.044
Hence,
he's never felt like a part of the family.

15:39.045 --> 15:40.896
He's been trapped in a nylon cage.

15:42.277 --> 15:44.252
Really? So, you're saying

15:44.253 --> 15:46.348
that all your tics come down to a chair?

15:46.349 --> 15:48.804
I know it sounds crazy,
but the weird thing is,

15:48.805 --> 15:50.948
I've been sitting here in
an inside chair all day

15:50.949 --> 15:52.708
and I haven't whooped or whispered once.

15:52.709 --> 15:54.204
Maybe it's the height...

15:54.205 --> 15:55.462
I just feel...

15:55.463 --> 15:57.160
Empowered.

15:57.161 --> 15:58.108
Included.

15:58.109 --> 15:59.430
It's kind of life-changing.

15:59.431 --> 16:03.188
So, in summary,
you people screwed Brick up,

16:03.189 --> 16:04.654
I fixed him, you're welcome,

16:04.655 --> 16:05.874
my work here is done.

16:07.991 --> 16:09.197
Oh, crap.

16:09.198 --> 16:10.186
- The hell?
- Oh, my God.

16:10.187 --> 16:11.822
Tell me you're not married, Sue.

16:11.823 --> 16:13.660
- I can explain.
- Say the words, Sue!

16:13.661 --> 16:14.804
I need to hear the words.

16:14.805 --> 16:16.516
I didn't get married.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.320
I went over to Darrin's,
and then his mom and her sister.

16:18.321 --> 16:20.318
Oh, and then... then...
then they're like "have babies"!

16:20.319 --> 16:23.037
It's been three days, Sue.
How could you not tell him?

16:23.038 --> 16:24.846
Well...

16:24.847 --> 16:27.591
I'm little,

16:27.592 --> 16:31.415
and want my daddy to fix my problems.

16:31.416 --> 16:32.502
That's it.

16:32.503 --> 16:34.470
No, Mike. I'll go. You're too angry.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.718
Actually, I'm the perfect amount of angry.

16:36.719 --> 16:37.916
Trust me,
this is better coming from a woman.

16:37.917 --> 16:40.839
- Don't... we tried a woman. She's 0 for 3.
- Get... no, no, don't go.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.215
Frankie, this is a dad's job,
and I'm gonna do it.

16:43.216 --> 16:44.300
- Gimme the keys.
- No, no, no. You can't do it.

16:44.301 --> 16:46.049
- Stop it. Stop it.
- No, no, no! Don't take the keys don't
try to fight me on this.

16:46.050 --> 16:47.235
No, listen, I'm telling you, you're
making a big mistake.

16:47.236 --> 16:49.360
Stop it, please!

16:49.361 --> 16:52.694
I can't stand what this is doing to us.

16:52.695 --> 16:56.446
As much as I would like for
you guys to fix my problems,

16:56.447 --> 16:58.263
it has to be me.

16:58.264 --> 17:00.957
Quitting, for me, is not an option.

17:00.958 --> 17:04.405
I am going to take off
the McGrew wedding dress

17:04.406 --> 17:06.047
and get this done.

17:09.289 --> 17:12.736
Okay. Can someone
help me with the zipper?

17:22.172 --> 17:23.973
Hey, Sue. Are you okay?

17:23.973 --> 17:26.675
My mom said you came by
and then you ran off.

17:26.675 --> 17:27.843
I was gonna call you, but...

17:27.844 --> 17:29.311
she told me most people get emotional

17:29.312 --> 17:30.946
when they see themselves in a wedding dress

17:30.947 --> 17:31.981
for the first time.

17:31.982 --> 17:34.217
Yeah, little bit.

17:41.658 --> 17:44.115
Darrin, there's something
I've been trying to say to you

17:44.116 --> 17:45.051
for the past few days,

17:45.052 --> 17:47.251
and I have been doing a terrible job of it.

17:47.252 --> 17:49.596
That's okay, Sue. I-I totally get it.

17:49.597 --> 17:50.860
I've been trying to say something

17:50.861 --> 17:52.268
to this guy, Dan, at work.

17:52.269 --> 17:54.196
He always whistles when
we're on jobs together,

17:54.197 --> 17:56.004
and when people's air
conditioners are broke,

17:56.005 --> 17:58.307
the last thing they want to
hear is some guy whistling.

17:58.308 --> 18:00.835
That's true. That totally makes sense.

18:00.836 --> 18:02.196
Darrin, I don't want to marry you.

18:04.108 --> 18:05.163
You don't?

18:05.164 --> 18:06.789
I'm so sorry,

18:06.790 --> 18:09.812
but this whole engagement thing
came totally out of the blue.

18:09.813 --> 18:12.462
I-I didn't know we were heading this way.

18:14.372 --> 18:16.491
Well, where did you think we were headed?

18:16.492 --> 18:18.619
I-I don't know... prom?

18:18.620 --> 18:21.887
I-I-I'm not ready for marriage, Darrin.

18:21.888 --> 18:24.218
I am only 17.

18:24.219 --> 18:26.396
I just got my braces off.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.741
There's a very good chance
I might still be grounded!

18:30.380 --> 18:31.779
But you seemed so happy.

18:31.780 --> 18:34.275
We chose the VFW hall,

18:34.276 --> 18:36.443
and we were gonna go see the Mermaids.

18:36.444 --> 18:39.219
Oh, is that it?
Do you not want to see the Mermaids?

18:39.220 --> 18:40.699
No, Darrin.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.641
Obviously, Mermaids are awesome.

18:42.642 --> 18:47.329
It's just, my life right now
has all these questions...

18:47.330 --> 18:50.320
where am I gonna live? What am I gonna do?

18:50.321 --> 18:52.073
And I don't know if I'm ready

18:52.074 --> 18:53.626
to have those questions answered yet.

18:53.627 --> 18:57.273
I have all these dreams
and things I want to do.

18:57.274 --> 18:59.185
I've never seen California,

18:59.186 --> 19:01.449
I have never lived in my own apartment,

19:01.450 --> 19:03.248
I've never eaten a truffle.

19:03.249 --> 19:04.636
I mean, I've had the chocolate ones,

19:04.637 --> 19:06.155
but I think there's another kind.

19:06.156 --> 19:10.011
I want to travel. I want to learn to paint.

19:10.012 --> 19:13.931
I want to cry when my parents
drop me off at college.

19:13.932 --> 19:17.427
I want to live in a dorm
with a really weird roommate

19:17.428 --> 19:19.498
and meet another girl who lives on my floor

19:19.499 --> 19:21.619
that I love and move in
with her the next semester.

19:21.620 --> 19:24.634
There's just this whole list of things,

19:24.635 --> 19:28.779
and getting married is not on that list.

19:32.371 --> 19:35.210
I love you, Darrin. I really do.

19:35.211 --> 19:37.970
And you might be the person

19:37.971 --> 19:40.227
that I'm supposed to be with forever,

19:40.228 --> 19:44.259
but I don't want my
forever to start right now.

19:47.075 --> 19:49.194
But that doesn't mean that
it's never gonna happen.

19:49.195 --> 19:50.611
We can still date.

19:50.612 --> 19:52.186
You can come visit me at college,

19:52.187 --> 19:54.167
and I can come home as much as I can.

19:54.168 --> 19:55.304
I don't want to date you, Sue.

19:57.192 --> 19:59.479
I don't have any questions about my life.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.999
I've got a good job and a house,

20:02.000 --> 20:03.816
and I'm ready for a wife.

20:04.889 --> 20:09.135
I don't want to wake up when
I'm 24 and not have kids.

20:10.479 --> 20:12.494
I want to get married.

20:13.973 --> 20:15.621
But do we have to do it right now?

20:17.937 --> 20:22.059
I love you, Sue,
and I'm ready to start a life together,

20:22.060 --> 20:23.467
but if you're not...

20:29.500 --> 20:30.773
Uh...

20:34.932 --> 20:37.168
This is just really sad.

20:51.141 --> 20:53.015
Goodbye, Sue Heck.
