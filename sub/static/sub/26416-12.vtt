What do you really want?

00:02.480 --> 00:04.613
All the Talkers
you have hidden away in there.

00:04.656 --> 00:05.744
They're not mine to give.

00:05.788 --> 00:07.790
Then you won't mind
if I just take them?

00:09.400 --> 00:10.923
Previously on Z Nation.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.447
What's gonna happen to them?

00:12.882 --> 00:14.927
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of them.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.408
I promise. They'll be safer
in their own space.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.541

I gave you?

As soon as you get to
Estes' computer, deploy it.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.241
Wait a minute. What is this?

00:24.285 --> 00:27.288
Guys,
anybody know what this is?

00:28.376 --> 00:30.117
What's final mercy?

a show of good faith.

00:52.965 --> 00:56.447
Me and my Talker friends
coming along nice and easy.

00:56.491 --> 00:57.753
You had a choice?

00:58.536 --> 01:00.147
There's always a choice.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.411
Roman! Roman! Roman!
Listen, listen, listen.

01:04.368 --> 01:06.544
My friends here, they are tired

01:06.588 --> 01:08.633
and could use
a couple of bizkits.

undead super demigod

01:14.813 --> 01:18.600
how long you gonna make us stand
here in this hot freaking sun?

01:18.643 --> 01:20.080
I have a vote to prepare for.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.342
A vote?! Great!

01:21.385 --> 01:23.735
I'll help pass out ballots
to my friends here.

01:23.779 --> 01:25.128
They live for democracy.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.783
They live for democracy, cute.

01:27.826 --> 01:32.048
Problem is Mr. Murphy, my
democracy is only for the living

01:33.223 --> 01:36.183
Well let's put that to a vote!
Huh?!

01:36.226 --> 01:37.923
Put them on the busses.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.752
Hey! This is voter suppression,
you know!

01:52.590 --> 01:55.332
Ugh, god, I'm going.
Take it easy.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.508
You know, you guys need to
watch out for these Talkers.

01:57.552 --> 02:00.076
They get a little iffy
when they're hungry.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.473
How long is this ride?

02:05.821 --> 02:08.780
Hey, stewardess?
Will there be bizkits?

02:12.001 --> 02:14.525
Need a little help
with that tire there, scout?

02:14.873 --> 02:17.006
I'm going. I'm going.

02:23.621 --> 02:24.927
Where's the driver?

02:24.970 --> 02:26.624
Hey! Wait.

02:26.929 --> 02:27.625
Hey!

02:28.539 --> 02:29.888
You can't just lock us in here!

They're going feral!

02:45.469 --> 02:47.210
Hey, what's going on?

02:47.993 --> 02:50.213
These busses
aren't going anywhere.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.260
Why did they shut up?

02:55.262 --> 02:56.350
Keep your eyes open!

All right George,
it's your turn.

03:53.407 --> 03:56.758
Come on, come on,
don't do this to me now.

03:59.282 --> 04:00.501
Try again.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.949
Maybe lift martial law
before voting day?

04:13.992 --> 04:15.733
Estes is unreal.

It's fear at work.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.651
Not letting that happen.

no matter what,

04:26.135 --> 04:27.702
we stick to the plan.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.791
I'm gonna go find Kaya.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.009
Stay alive.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.111
Kaya?

04:50.464 --> 04:51.073
Kaya?

05:03.390 --> 05:05.043
Come to mama.

I could've had a career.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.316
And where are the Talkers now?

08:55.796 --> 08:58.102
Umm, I dunno. They ran off.

It doesn't matter because
you can't protect them anyway.

09:37.838 --> 09:40.057
Where is everyone
getting these phones?

09:41.232 --> 09:42.494
I should take this.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.409
Do you have a phone?

09:44.453 --> 09:45.802
Yes?

09:47.935 --> 09:48.892
Yes.

I understand, Roman.

Yes.

You're not taking me to Altura?

10:04.778 --> 10:06.040
No need.

Estes has already arrested

10:18.356 --> 10:20.315
I don't want to go to Altura.

Hey.

10:34.590 --> 10:35.809
They will.

10:40.683 --> 10:41.553
Anything?

10:41.771 --> 10:44.165
Not yet. Still checking cameras.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.254
We need eyes on them.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.606
I don't like this.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.912
The Talkers are in the wind.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.653
George and Warren
infiltrate Altura

10:53.696 --> 10:55.263
the day before the election.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.657
They're up to something.

10:59.571 --> 11:02.357
Let me find out
what they're up to.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.447
What about the Talkers?
They need to stay lost.

11:06.317 --> 11:07.884
Don't you worry.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.582
The Talkers won't be voting.

11:11.801 --> 11:16.501
And I'll make sure George tells
us everything we need to know.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.084
This it?

11:34.128 --> 11:35.825
I think so.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.915
Yeah,
it's right where Warren said.

11:39.437 --> 11:40.656
Let's get to it.

11:41.657 --> 11:44.138
Let's go, everybody!
You got your orders!

12:35.189 --> 12:36.886
What happened to you?

12:36.930 --> 12:39.454
Have you been lying to me
this whole time?

12:39.497 --> 12:42.370
Unbridled idealism
is rather easy to direct.

12:42.413 --> 12:45.373
I think the word you want
is manipulate.

12:46.461 --> 12:47.767
I see, I saw.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.030
Final mercy, Estes?

12:50.682 --> 12:52.989
That's your idea of democracy?

12:53.381 --> 12:54.904
So you hacked me?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.427
We know everything.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.908
How do you think your fellow
Alturans are gonna feel

12:58.952 --> 13:00.736
when they find out
you're behind the blast?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.477
And who's gonna tell them?

13:02.520 --> 13:03.391
You?

13:03.434 --> 13:05.393
The truth always gets out.

13:05.436 --> 13:06.960
Does it, though?

13:07.351 --> 13:08.570
While you're
locked in this cell,

13:10.180 --> 13:11.791
Altura's gonna elect me Supreme
Commander of Security Forces.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.010
And you'll be convicted
of treason.

13:14.881 --> 13:15.882
Treason?

13:17.405 --> 13:18.972
Harboring fugitive of Talkers,
theft of Altura lithium,

13:19.015 --> 13:21.583
and the illegal hack
of Altura computers.

13:22.889 --> 13:26.196
We take a very dim view
of election interference here.

13:27.676 --> 13:30.853
Why, Estes

13:30.897 --> 13:34.857
It's not personal,
just evolution.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.511
Bring her.

13:38.295 --> 13:39.427
Hey, wait.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.559
Where are you taking her?

13:44.998 --> 13:47.000
Just to answer a few questions.

13:50.264 --> 13:54.094
Don't worry about her, George.
I'm playing good cop.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.411
Hi.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.985
I could never get used to that.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.075
The zombie virus
is singularly focused.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.251
It wants brains.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.907
I feel so bad for Becky.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.866
She's at peace now.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.956
The only thing making her hand
move is the virus.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.219
After all the trials
and horrific tests,

14:32.262 --> 14:34.874
it all comes back
to where my mission started.

14:35.396 --> 14:36.919
Murphy's blood.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.703
The virus works
in mysterious ways.

14:38.747 --> 14:41.750
Something in the primordial ooze
that runs in Murphy's veins

14:41.793 --> 14:44.796
binds to the same neuro-
receptors as the zombie virus.

14:44.840 --> 14:49.236
It can be any one of a hundred
unidentified antibodies.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.588
But the other ninety nine
could kill you.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.504
But you're close, right?

14:57.809 --> 14:59.289
Maybe we'll get lucky.

14:59.724 --> 15:00.812
Hold it still.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.038
Another moment.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.347
What should I do?

15:13.390 --> 15:14.565
Let go of it.

15:32.714 --> 15:33.933
Careful.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.200
It wants something.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.071
What does it mean?

15:42.637 --> 15:45.031
Some mysterious contaminate
in Murphy's blood

15:45.074 --> 15:48.512
killed the virus
and re-humanized Becky's hand.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.037
The cure.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.954
You found the cure.

15:56.651 --> 15:59.523
Welcome back to Altura,
Lieutenant Warren.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.743
Your return is unexpected

16:02.265 --> 16:03.875
and your timing curious.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.837
Thank you for the warm welcome.

16:09.664 --> 16:13.233
I gotta say Altura's hospitality

16:13.973 --> 16:16.105
still needs a little work.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.935
Where are the Talkers?

16:19.979 --> 16:20.327
Hmm?

16:22.198 --> 16:23.591
What Talkers?

16:27.508 --> 16:30.337
You and George are planning
something with the Talkers

16:30.380 --> 16:32.817
which is doomed to fail.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.951
Haven't we mercied enough
already?

16:35.995 --> 16:39.999
You can't stop the vote, but you
can stop the bloodshed right now

16:45.352 --> 16:46.701
Think of your kind.

16:46.744 --> 16:48.877
You willing to decide
for every human in Altura

16:48.920 --> 16:49.878
that your way is right?

16:49.921 --> 16:51.445
Isn't that what you're doing?

16:54.361 --> 16:57.625
Where...are...the Talkers?

17:07.113 --> 17:10.203
Okay, Warren gave the high sign.
Go back to George.

17:12.335 --> 17:16.209
That chick with the creepy mask
makes me nervous.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.341
What are they doing?

17:18.385 --> 17:20.039
They're torturing her.

17:22.476 --> 17:23.085
What happened?

17:23.129 --> 17:24.130
I don't know.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.783
Must've been a power surge.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.220
Is there a signal?

17:27.263 --> 17:30.701
The system rebooted.
I have to find my way back in.

17:37.491 --> 17:40.537
What the hell?
Damn thing stole my money.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.150
Come on man,
you gotta be kidding me.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.072
Finally.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.946
This could take a while.

17:59.861 --> 18:04.866
I'll break your
fingers. I'll break your toes.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.267
Or, I'll break your nose.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.316
Oh, did you not learn that
when you were a kid?

18:20.360 --> 18:22.840
What's it like being Estes' pet?

18:22.884 --> 18:25.147
Jealousy does not become you,
George.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.322
He's using you.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.237
We're using each other.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.761
We have big plans.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.241
I'm his queen.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.461
You keep telling yourself that.

18:34.504 --> 18:37.116
Why are you and Warren
in Altura?

18:37.638 --> 18:39.379
We're sight seeing.

18:39.422 --> 18:42.860
Where...are...the Talkers?

18:42.904 --> 18:45.167
Well you rounded them up.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.864
You tell me.

18:46.908 --> 18:49.780
I'm actually glad
you're not cooperating.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.001
Why are you siding with Estes
over your own kind?

18:54.524 --> 18:55.917
They are not my kind!

18:55.960 --> 18:57.005
You're a Talker.

18:58.441 --> 18:59.964
I...

19:00.008 --> 19:02.576
I am not a Talker.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.144
There's no shame in being dead.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.842
My best friend is...

19:08.495 --> 19:10.453
was a Talker.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.152
Oh yes,

19:13.195 --> 19:16.067
the poor rebel Dante.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.940
He was so helplessly
devoted to you.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.637
Don't talk about him.

19:20.681 --> 19:23.988
Oh I think I've earned the right
to say whatever I want

19:24.032 --> 19:25.686
about Dante.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.471
What's that supposed to mean?

19:29.777 --> 19:30.604
Oh,

19:32.258 --> 19:35.348
you really don't know, do you?

19:35.696 --> 19:38.002
Oh that's precious.

19:39.656 --> 19:44.531
This is gonna be way better
than electricity.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.185
What?

19:47.229 --> 19:48.796
You see, George,

19:49.144 --> 19:52.582
it was me that killed Dante.

19:52.974 --> 19:55.803
Not some random vigilantes.

19:58.762 --> 19:59.807
Bullshit.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.724
He did ask me
to give you a message though.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.117
His last words, so to speak.

20:06.422 --> 20:10.078
Now what were they? Hmm.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.472
Oh yes. "George."

20:12.515 --> 20:14.996
"George, please help me."

20:16.780 --> 20:20.436
"Why did you leave me all alone?
George, I need you."

20:20.480 --> 20:22.046
"Please. Oh no, stop.
Please don't do that."

20:22.090 --> 20:22.917
Shut up.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.135
"Please stop."

20:24.179 --> 20:25.746
"Just, just stop.
Don't do that please."

20:25.789 --> 20:27.748
"Just stop. No! No!"

20:27.791 --> 20:29.010
You freak!

20:33.493 --> 20:34.537
Now you're getting it!

20:34.581 --> 20:36.409
Dante was the best person
I ever knew!

20:36.452 --> 20:37.845
Oh he wasn't a person.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.240
By the time I got through with
him, he wasn't even a Talker.

20:42.197 --> 20:46.810
All that was left
was a bag of garbage.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.511
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

20:52.599 --> 20:56.994
Where...are...the Talkers?

21:14.403 --> 21:17.319
Ever notice how Murphy's never
around for the heavy lifting?

21:17.363 --> 21:19.321
He's clever that way.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.454
Why can't I be clever that way?

21:21.497 --> 21:23.412
Cuz you are a good man.

21:23.847 --> 21:24.413
Thanks, Doc.

21:24.457 --> 21:25.284
You're welcome.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.764
Nice to know a compliment

21:27.808 --> 21:30.506
still means something
in a world like this.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.551
You know, kid,

21:32.900 --> 21:34.336
there's no telling
how this is gonna turn out.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.164
But whatever happens,

21:36.686 --> 21:37.905
you keep going.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.516
You're resilient.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.040
You're my damn cockroach, right?

21:44.215 --> 21:46.827
I know your dad
would be real proud.

21:47.218 --> 21:48.481
I sure am.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.352
I love you, kid.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.049
Like you were my own son.

21:52.485 --> 21:53.616
Thanks, Doc.

21:54.269 --> 21:55.139
You too.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.534
You think this is gonna work?

21:59.056 --> 22:02.146
Well it better. A whole lot
of lives depend on it.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.324
Hey, can we get some more cable
over here?

22:14.376 --> 22:15.943
It's gonna be all right.

22:20.077 --> 22:21.818
Get down. Get down!

22:24.560 --> 22:25.518
Murphy!

22:26.083 --> 22:27.084
Hey!

22:27.128 --> 22:29.435
Hey! It's just me.
Everything's okay.

22:29.783 --> 22:30.610
Everyone okay?

22:30.653 --> 22:31.175
Yeah.

22:32.046 --> 22:33.569
Yeah. They're almost ready.

22:35.571 --> 22:36.833
So umm,

22:37.704 --> 22:39.270
back there at the busses.

22:39.836 --> 22:40.271
Wow.

22:41.316 --> 22:42.796
You got a lot of issues
to work out.

22:42.839 --> 22:43.492
Thanks.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.886
I did it for them.

22:46.277 --> 22:47.583
Not for you.

22:47.627 --> 22:50.499
Look, I'm just trying to say
you...

22:50.543 --> 22:52.719
you got a way
with that Z-Whacker.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.591
Are you trying to give me
a compliment?

22:56.462 --> 22:57.898
While I can.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.948
Any attack on Altura
by the Talkers would be folly.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.473
I sense you know that.

23:08.909 --> 23:12.739
I think you're confusing me
with someone who scares easily.

23:12.782 --> 23:14.262
Hmm, am I?

23:16.917 --> 23:19.223
Tell me where the Talkers
are hiding.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.664
You tell the people of Altura

23:24.707 --> 23:26.927
what you did to their friends
and their neighbors.

23:27.318 --> 23:31.148
You let the Talkers come back
and vote, and then maybe

23:31.192 --> 23:32.846
I'll let you live.

23:36.502 --> 23:41.202
I find it amusing that you think
there's still a debate to be had

23:42.812 --> 23:44.988
Goodbye, Lieutenant Warren.

23:45.032 --> 23:47.426
There comes a time
when everyone turns Talker.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.166
Remember that, Estes!

23:51.168 --> 23:52.256
Everything?

23:52.300 --> 23:53.606
Everything you can carry.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.085
Where can we go?

23:55.346 --> 23:57.523
Anywhere to get this
out of Estes' hands.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.263
Pacifica. Hackerville.

23:59.525 --> 24:00.656
Even zombie territory.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.093
My friend has access
to an Altura truck.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.486
Maybe I can get it.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.182
Okay.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.446
But be careful.

24:08.229 --> 24:09.186
Red?

24:10.318 --> 24:11.362
Hurry.

24:24.941 --> 24:26.116
That was fast.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.728
Estes?

24:29.119 --> 24:30.338
Going somewhere?

24:30.904 --> 24:32.645
With my lab?

24:37.737 --> 24:39.608
Oh, you know what...

24:42.698 --> 24:43.873
Where's George?

24:48.661 --> 24:50.140
Where'd you take her?!

24:51.315 --> 24:53.753
The power surge corrupted
the password generator.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.406
I'm trying to patch
a work-around.

24:55.450 --> 24:56.538
Want me to try?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.061
No, I got this.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.019
Okay.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.935
We're back in.

25:02.544 --> 25:03.937
Go back. It's Warren.

25:05.112 --> 25:06.592
You can get the door.

25:06.896 --> 25:09.072
Any second.

25:10.857 --> 25:11.553
Hang on.

25:12.075 --> 25:12.859
Hang on.

25:14.251 --> 25:15.470
Okay, got it.

25:17.820 --> 25:18.908
She's out.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.606
One down. Now where's George?

25:20.997 --> 25:22.085
There's Sun Mei.

25:22.129 --> 25:23.347
And Estes.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.524
Does that feel funny to you?

25:25.567 --> 25:28.178
That dude
is seven kinds of wrong.

25:28.222 --> 25:29.876
Find George and go back to that.

25:31.051 --> 25:31.965
Oh no.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.270
This is bad.

25:34.445 --> 25:36.230
I'll get with Warren
and we'll find George.

25:36.273 --> 25:37.797
Keep an eye on Sun Mei.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.407
Be careful, baby.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.540
Hand me a Diet Coke.

25:58.992 --> 26:01.081
You can tell me, George.

26:01.124 --> 26:04.519
Are the Talkers planning
an attack on Altura?

26:05.781 --> 26:07.478
I'm sorry about earlier.

26:08.131 --> 26:09.785
Is your hand okay?

26:09.829 --> 26:12.527
I hope you didn't break your
little bird bones on my face.

26:15.486 --> 26:18.664
What are you and the Talkers
planning?

26:19.360 --> 26:20.579
Tell me now.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.235
Ruin all your fun?

26:25.888 --> 26:27.063
Come on.

26:34.810 --> 26:37.900
I can do this
for as long as it takes.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.336
Ditto.

26:51.174 --> 26:52.698
Oh come on.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.059
What's the matter?

27:06.407 --> 27:07.408
You okay, Sun Mei?

27:07.451 --> 27:08.975
We were just sanitizing the lab

27:09.018 --> 27:10.933
so the samples
don't get contaminated.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.200
Why don't you have a seat?

27:17.244 --> 27:18.767
You've been working so hard
lately.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.639
I suppose that's true.

27:21.117 --> 27:25.774
The trials have taken
a toll on me. But I have...

27:25.818 --> 27:27.210
I insist.

27:34.087 --> 27:36.567
I haven't seen you in days.
You look...

27:37.743 --> 27:38.787
tired.

27:41.311 --> 27:43.531
How do you keep all this
straight?

27:43.966 --> 27:46.665
VN 5. What's this one?

27:48.014 --> 27:49.668
Just another failure.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.105
Why keep it?

27:52.845 --> 27:54.977
To learn why it failed.

27:55.021 --> 27:57.676
Ah yes, the scientific method.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.681
What's in here?

28:03.464 --> 28:06.423
Careful.
That's pure zombie virus.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.341
Well, look at that.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.262
Impressive work
with that zombie hand

28:19.306 --> 28:20.742
if it means
what I think it does.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.439
You're spying on me?

28:22.701 --> 28:24.572
Is that a real question?

28:25.138 --> 28:26.269
What do you want?

28:27.575 --> 28:29.751
Another question you already
know the answer to.

28:30.447 --> 28:33.189
Lean back. Get comfortable.

28:35.365 --> 28:38.020
Estes,
you don't have to do this.

28:44.592 --> 28:45.854
What are you doing?

28:46.812 --> 28:48.944
Compelling the witness.

28:48.988 --> 28:49.379
No.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.381
No, no, no, no, no. Please.

28:51.904 --> 28:53.732
You don't have to, okay?

28:54.297 --> 28:55.429
No.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.256
No.

29:02.349 --> 29:03.829
Now maybe you'll tell me.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.702
Is this the zombie cure?

29:10.357 --> 29:11.227
This one?

29:11.271 --> 29:12.663
Pick the right one.

29:12.707 --> 29:15.666
I want to watch the cure work
on a live human subject.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.460
Which one is the vaccine?

29:31.508 --> 29:32.683
Never.

29:33.249 --> 29:35.034
Okay, I'll just find it myself.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.950
I have no shortage
of human subjects,

29:37.993 --> 29:39.429
starting with your friends.

29:43.346 --> 29:44.913
You had one job.

29:44.957 --> 29:45.740
Sorry, boss.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.524
You let Warren escape?

29:49.178 --> 29:50.789
Don't go anywhere.

30:10.809 --> 30:15.204
When are the Talkers
planning an attack on Altura?

30:15.596 --> 30:17.163
Election day?

30:17.424 --> 30:19.252
I'm not telling you.

30:19.295 --> 30:20.427
Oh.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.256
So they are planning an attack?

30:24.387 --> 30:25.258
Pandora.

30:25.301 --> 30:26.607
Where are the Talkers hiding?

30:27.434 --> 30:28.478
I can't.

30:28.522 --> 30:30.089
Where are the Talkers?!

30:30.132 --> 30:31.655
I'm gonna kill you.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.135
Oh, please.

30:33.179 --> 30:35.485
I barely touched you.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.183
Now hold still.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.532
Or don't.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.186
Don't do this.

30:42.101 --> 30:46.627
Such exquisite bone structure
you have.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.934
And those cheeks...

30:50.109 --> 30:51.675
marvelous.

30:52.633 --> 30:56.942
And your eyes are so exotic.

31:01.337 --> 31:04.993
Pierre is gonna find you
delicious.

31:05.385 --> 31:06.821
Where are the Talkers?

31:07.256 --> 31:08.301
Pierre?

31:08.736 --> 31:09.955
He's French.

31:11.913 --> 31:15.482
Through the face is the long way
to the brain.

31:16.831 --> 31:23.359
But the nose cartilage and the
eye cavities go down so easy.

31:23.620 --> 31:24.926
Where are the Talkers?

31:26.188 --> 31:27.886
Don't do this.

31:30.976 --> 31:34.283
Oh we are well past the point
of listening.

31:34.327 --> 31:35.241
Besides,

31:36.720 --> 31:39.027
I couldn't possibly
disappoint Pierre, now could I?

31:40.942 --> 31:42.726
Oh, who's a hungry zombie?

31:42.770 --> 31:45.642
You're a hungry zombie,
yes you are.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.950
Who does? Yes, you.

31:48.994 --> 31:53.650
Who wants to eat the face of the
dirty rotten disgusting traitor?

31:54.782 --> 31:55.914
Where are the Talkers?!

31:59.439 --> 32:00.483
Good boy.

32:01.832 --> 32:03.791
George, I really would recommend
you telling Pierre

32:03.834 --> 32:06.837
where the Talkers are
before he eats your lips off.

32:07.969 --> 32:09.840
Where...are...the Talkers,
George?!

32:09.884 --> 32:12.408
Get him away from me.
Get him away.

32:13.279 --> 32:16.151
Oh good boy. Down boy, down.

32:18.806 --> 32:21.374
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

32:22.201 --> 32:24.377
Where are the Talkers?

32:26.988 --> 32:27.815
Hey.

32:28.033 --> 32:29.425
I got the truck.

32:29.469 --> 32:31.775
I don't know
if there's enough gas.

32:34.604 --> 32:35.301
Sun Mei?

32:36.215 --> 32:38.043
Sun Mei, what happened?

32:38.086 --> 32:39.348
I don't understand.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.963
The vaccine
turned the hand back.

32:47.095 --> 32:48.618
Which one is it, Sun Mei?

32:49.750 --> 32:50.403
Uh,

32:51.056 --> 32:52.971
this one

32:53.797 --> 32:55.669
Uh, VN 4

32:57.236 --> 32:58.977
This one has no label.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.067
Why would you remove the label?

33:03.285 --> 33:04.330
Right.

33:04.678 --> 33:05.766
This is it.

33:05.809 --> 33:06.506
Got it!

33:07.072 --> 33:08.073
Oh shit!

34:04.433 --> 34:05.608
Red?

34:07.262 --> 34:08.742
Sun Mei?

34:08.785 --> 34:10.396
It really works.

34:15.705 --> 34:18.099
Sun Mei, no.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.633
Even if the Talkers
get the vote,

34:30.938 --> 34:32.940
do you think
they'll ever fit in?

34:33.419 --> 34:36.552
Fit in about as good as
you or I, I guess.

34:36.596 --> 34:38.424
Just about.

34:38.467 --> 34:41.775
I just feel like Estes
is never gonna let it happen.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.733
Warren and George
will take care of Estes.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.387
Yeah,
but what about the next Estes.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.955
There's always gonna be
another one.

34:47.998 --> 34:49.739
Humans aren't evolving.

34:50.044 --> 34:50.697
No.

34:51.654 --> 34:53.221
But we are.

34:54.744 --> 34:58.096
I'm just afraid there's no place
for us, Murphy.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.664
Wanna take these Talkers
up over the hill?

35:02.012 --> 35:03.101
Start over.

35:03.362 --> 35:04.885
I don't know.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.062
I don't know.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.458
Double the perimeter security.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.677
Take a couple men
and find Lieutenant Warren.

35:14.721 --> 35:17.245
I don't want her skulking about
today of all days.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.640
George broke.

35:21.858 --> 35:24.296
I hope that was fun for you.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.515
She spilled her guts,

35:26.559 --> 35:27.995
literally.

35:29.605 --> 35:31.433
It seems they set a staging area
for the Talkers near Pacifica.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.175
I'll activate the security force
and the reserves.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.221
I'm gonna send every available
Alturan

35:36.264 --> 35:39.746
to wipe their kind off
this godforsaken Earth.

35:39.789 --> 35:40.616
Everyone?

35:40.877 --> 35:42.096
But what about guarding Altura?

35:42.140 --> 35:43.184
I've accounted for that.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.838
Of course, Estes.
I only meant...

35:44.881 --> 35:45.839
Where is George?

35:47.449 --> 35:49.843
Well she and Pierre,

35:49.886 --> 35:52.715
well they're having
a little snack.

35:54.587 --> 35:56.806
Good for Pierre.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.390
Which one was it?

36:15.434 --> 36:16.783
They all look the same.

36:16.826 --> 36:18.132
No kidding.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.177
Hey.

36:19.655 --> 36:20.482
Down here.

36:21.962 --> 36:22.876
Open it.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.054
Kaya?

36:28.969 --> 36:31.058
Almost there.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.278
Almost there.

36:34.148 --> 36:35.758
Oh hurry, Kaya.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.374
George?

36:42.809 --> 36:43.940
George?

36:45.333 --> 36:47.814
It's me. It's me. It's me.
It's me. Hey, it's me.

36:48.771 --> 36:50.033
Hey.

36:52.906 --> 36:54.734
A little close for comfort?

36:55.300 --> 36:56.605
A little.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.960
How did you do this exactly?

37:08.704 --> 37:09.836
Hey.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.794
Did you give it up?

37:13.143 --> 37:14.057
All of it?

37:15.233 --> 37:16.843
All of it.

37:16.886 --> 37:17.626
Good girl.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.280
We need to find Sun Mei.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.848
Last I saw, she was alone with
Estes, and that can't be good.

37:21.891 --> 37:22.718
Let's go.

37:22.762 --> 37:24.285
All right, let me help you.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.244
No, I got it.

37:31.205 --> 37:32.902
No. No.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.252
Leave it.

37:35.383 --> 37:38.081
It's holding in my guts.

37:40.823 --> 37:41.781
Oh no.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.570
What happened?

37:48.614 --> 37:49.441
Where's Estes?

37:49.484 --> 37:50.311
He's coming back.

37:50.355 --> 37:51.834
This does not look good.

37:52.835 --> 37:53.923
I did it.

37:55.534 --> 37:57.275
The vaccine works.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.233
Zombie and back.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.584
Zombie and back?
Like a bizkit booster shot?

38:03.368 --> 38:04.456
Can you restore Talkers?

38:04.499 --> 38:06.196
Talkers, zombies,

38:06.936 --> 38:08.938
fresh ones anyways.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.725
It's a cure.

38:13.552 --> 38:14.901
It's a start.

38:16.119 --> 38:17.251
Okay.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.165
Uh,

38:18.470 --> 38:20.776
we can't let Estes find out.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.256
Let's grab your research
and let's go.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.866
I can't go with you.

38:27.261 --> 38:28.871
I can't.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.396
But what you need for the cure

38:32.005 --> 38:33.441
is right up here.

38:41.710 --> 38:43.277
One last smoke?

38:43.321 --> 38:46.149
Now, now, don't be a fatalist.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.847
I'm gonna go hide the truck.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.414
All right, be careful.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.421
Last smoke my ass.

38:57.726 --> 38:58.771
They seem nervous.

38:58.814 --> 39:00.294
They are.

39:00.642 --> 39:03.297
Hold tight, guys.
It's almost time.

39:05.299 --> 39:07.432
The vote is waiting for you.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.696
Citizenship is waiting for you,

39:11.218 --> 39:12.437
if you want it.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.614
But you're gonna have to
take it.

39:16.571 --> 39:19.269
And we're gonna be there
with you. Arm up!

39:46.471 --> 39:48.560
Pierre? No!

39:50.213 --> 39:52.433
The lab. They went to the lab.

39:56.785 --> 39:58.265
Sun Mei,

39:59.005 --> 40:00.963
we can't do this.

40:01.007 --> 40:02.225
I'm dying.

40:02.269 --> 40:04.924
I'll be the first death
since the Black Rain.

40:04.967 --> 40:07.317
If this is this about
Murphy's blood.

40:07.361 --> 40:08.884
We can get more.

40:08.928 --> 40:12.105
The antibodies in Murphy's blood
are evolving daily.

40:12.148 --> 40:13.236
The only way to be sure

40:14.586 --> 40:15.543
is to take my brain
and preserve it before I die.

40:15.587 --> 40:17.284
Maybe we could sew you up,

40:17.327 --> 40:19.373
give you a transfusion,
something?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.158
I've lost too much blood.

40:23.464 --> 40:24.509
If Estes gets ahold of me...

40:24.552 --> 40:26.119
I won't let him.

40:29.339 --> 40:30.863
Get the syringe.

40:33.126 --> 40:35.389
I can't inject you with poison.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.913
Yes, you can.

40:44.877 --> 40:47.227
The poison will leave a dead end
for Estes.

40:47.270 --> 40:48.968
He'll have nothing to work with.

40:50.404 --> 40:51.927
Tie me off

40:52.580 --> 40:55.061
so the injection doesn't
interfere with the vaccine

40:55.104 --> 40:56.410
in the brain tissue.

40:56.932 --> 40:59.587
You'll have what you need
to recreate the cure.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.373
Hurry before Estes comes back.

41:03.417 --> 41:06.202
Sun Mei. Sun Mei, please.

41:07.334 --> 41:08.204
No.

41:11.947 --> 41:13.558
This is my part.

41:19.912 --> 41:21.435
Guys, hurry.

41:21.653 --> 41:23.176
Have mercy my sister.

41:23.219 --> 41:25.831
Give it to Murphy.
He'll know what to do.

41:38.017 --> 41:41.150
Use a manual override.
I need in this lab now!

41:46.852 --> 41:49.811
Spiteful. You are spiteful!

41:50.333 --> 41:51.770
What did they do?

41:51.813 --> 41:53.685
The last time I saw this woman,
she was a zombie.

41:53.728 --> 41:54.990
I infected her myself.

41:55.034 --> 41:57.253
Looks like they took her brain

41:57.297 --> 41:58.777
and the cure with it.

41:59.691 --> 42:02.258
They think they can keep
her discovery from me.

42:02.302 --> 42:03.825
Drain every drop of blood
from her.

42:03.869 --> 42:06.567
Maybe I can recover some traces
of the vaccine.

42:06.611 --> 42:07.742
Yes, Commander.

42:07.786 --> 42:09.004
I want you to go to that camp.

42:10.397 --> 42:11.093
I want you to mercy
every Talker, every traitor.

42:12.007 --> 42:12.747
No one stands against Altura!

42:12.791 --> 42:13.618
Yes.

42:13.661 --> 42:15.620
Find them and kill them all!

42:18.013 --> 42:19.145
Yes.

42:29.634 --> 42:32.462
Where did your little brain go?
