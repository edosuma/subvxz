WEBVTT

00:05.105 --> 00:08.039
Well...

00:08.108 --> 00:10.542
Okay. Now that we're all in the van...

00:10.610 --> 00:12.669
and you guys
can't change your mind...

00:12.746 --> 00:15.271
I just want you to know
that we're not exactly...

00:15.348 --> 00:19.079
on the way to my uncle's
fabulous cabin in the woods.

00:19.152 --> 00:21.177
It's really more of an ice shack.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.188
Did you say ice shack?

00:23.256 --> 00:25.588
Hmm? Yeah.

00:25.658 --> 00:27.717
Oh, and, uh, the hot tub...

00:27.794 --> 00:29.728
It's really more
of a garbage can.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.894
Oh, but it's also
the bathroom, so...

00:33.967 --> 00:37.994
- Kelso, turn this van around!
- No, Donna, wait.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.005
Is there beer?

00:40.073 --> 00:43.531
Tons. Hey, and we don't even
need a refrigerator...

00:43.610 --> 00:46.511
'cause it's so freakin' cold.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.648
- Paradise.
- Yeah.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.514
Oh, and, uh,
before we pick up Jackie...

00:52.585 --> 00:55.053
I just want to make sure everybody knows
what this trip is about.

00:55.121 --> 00:56.884
The fabulous hot-tub toilet?

00:58.425 --> 01:01.189
No. Eric, tell her
about my master plan.

01:01.261 --> 01:05.664
Oh. Yeah. See, Kelso, when you start
a sentence with the words "master plan,"

01:05.732 --> 01:08.997
I just kind of know it's gonna be stupid,
so I just naturally tune out.

01:11.004 --> 01:15.031
Okay, well, my master plan is...

01:15.108 --> 01:18.544
Eric! Pay attention!

01:19.612 --> 01:21.546
This is about
a romantic double date.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.548
It's you and Donna
and me and Jackie.

01:23.616 --> 01:27.985
Kelso, you do know you're not
actually dating Jackie, right?

01:28.054 --> 01:30.284
That's why
it's a secret double date.

01:30.356 --> 01:33.416
See, I told Jackie that
the whole gang was coming...

01:33.493 --> 01:36.326
but then, I didn't invite Hyde,
especially not Fez.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.330
He's all over Jackie.

01:38.398 --> 01:41.367
Look. I'm not doing this.
Turn this van around!

01:41.434 --> 01:43.368
No! I need you guys.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.836
See, if you're there...
You guys are, like, the perfect couple.

01:45.905 --> 01:47.839
And... And if you're there...

01:47.907 --> 01:50.876
then, I can just copy all the sissy,
loser things that Eric does for you.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.904
I really do enjoy
your sissy, loser things.

01:54.981 --> 01:58.439
Yeah, like when I had first dibs
on that seat, but I took the hump.

01:58.518 --> 02:01.351
It's a small price to pay
to keep my lady happy.

02:02.422 --> 02:04.890
Exactly. I want to be that dork.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.448
Hmm.

02:08.495 --> 02:11.987
- Kelso, why are you speeding up?
- I gotta beat this light.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.898
- Why?
- I just... I gotta!

02:18.104 --> 02:20.004
Damn it!

02:25.845 --> 02:28.336
What are you doing?

02:28.414 --> 02:30.644
I've been chasing you
for six blocks.

02:31.918 --> 02:34.352
I'm sorry, buddy.
I didn't see you.

02:34.420 --> 02:38.550
Yeah, nice try. I know
all about your master plan.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.593
Now, drive,
you sneaky son of a bitch.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.269 --> 03:25.237
You brought me to an outhouse?

03:25.305 --> 03:29.207
Actually, Jackie...
That's the outhouse.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.903
No! No, it's an ice shack,
for fishing.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.310
I... This is gonna be a blast.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.349
I me... It is so beautiful out here.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.853
Plus, I brought lotion.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.519
Ooh, it's kinda cold.

03:48.595 --> 03:52.656
Here, take my jacket.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.723
I love you.

03:54.801 --> 03:59.033
God, we are such
the... perfect couple.

04:00.039 --> 04:01.666
I'm cold too.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.608
Well, damn, Jackie.
I can't control the weather!

04:06.813 --> 04:10.544
Here, Jackie, take my coat.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.211
Ohh, thanks, Fez.

04:15.822 --> 04:18.814
So, sweetie,
what do you want to do?

04:18.891 --> 04:21.757
- Whatever you want to do, honey.
- I want to go inside.

04:21.827 --> 04:24.661
- That's what I want to do too.
- Oh, my God! Let's go.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.861
Hey, what the hell was
that jacket business, man?

04:29.936 --> 04:32.097
Uh, you're making me look bad.

04:32.171 --> 04:35.072
Look, Kelso, you are
my good, good friend...

04:35.141 --> 04:37.234
but I will stop at nothing
to win Jackie...

04:37.310 --> 04:39.335
and if you're in my way,
I will destroy you.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.441
This is nice,
you coming home for lunch.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.951
Yeah.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.759
Good afternoon, sunshine.

04:55.828 --> 04:58.262
<i>So, what have you</i>
<i>got planned for today?</i>

04:58.331 --> 05:03.963
Same as every day. Lie on the couch,
do my nails, avoid talking to you.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.072
It's not going that well, so far.

05:11.411 --> 05:15.279
Red, that girl does nothing
but party all night and sleep all day.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.782
She's gonna end up
like Aunt Martha.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.310
Remember the beer gut on her?

05:21.387 --> 05:24.686
She's not gonna end up
like Fat Martha.

05:26.059 --> 05:30.086
Poor woman got so large
she couldn't play putt-putt.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.222
Geez, don't remind me.

05:32.298 --> 05:35.756
That par two was the longest
three hours of my life.

05:35.835 --> 05:39.669
Red, your daughter is drifting.
So what are you gonna do?

05:39.739 --> 05:42.003
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.805
I'm gonna start eating
my lunch at the office.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.179
Leo, man, glad you're here.
I've been really busy.

05:53.252 --> 05:59.020
Oh, yeah? I guess my "buy one, get one free"
flyer is really bringing in the business.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.686
That's 'cause you forgot
the "buy one" part.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.431
Oh, no.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.433
Well, good thing
we're closing early, man...

06:08.501 --> 06:10.662
'cause I need you to give me a ride
over to my Cousin Larry's.

06:10.737 --> 06:14.104
- I don't have a car, man.
- You can drive mine, man.

06:15.875 --> 06:19.902
- I can't drive since my license got suspended.
- Why? What'd you do?

06:19.979 --> 06:23.107
Well, I dropped it
in some soda, you know?

06:23.182 --> 06:25.742
And it just hung there,
suspended.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.845
And then when I was looking at it,
I ran a red light.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.327
Boy, ice fishing's fun.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.464
I like this place, out here
in the middle of a frozen lake.

06:47.540 --> 06:51.067
It's cozy,
don't you think, Jackie?

06:53.946 --> 06:56.813
If by "cozy," you mean
"small and smelly," then, yes!

06:58.885 --> 07:01.319
Good one, Jackie.

07:01.387 --> 07:03.218
That's funny.

07:03.289 --> 07:06.087
Well, she needs a sense of humor
with an unfaithful ex-boyfriend...

07:06.159 --> 07:08.593
who brings her
to a dump like this.

07:08.661 --> 07:11.289
Ow.

07:11.364 --> 07:14.424
- Nice.
- Thank you.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.094
I mean, Eric would never take
Donna to a place like this.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.104
Fez, it wouldn't matter
where we were.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.265
- Just being together makes it fun.
- Aw.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.501
But I would never bring you
to a place like this...

07:23.576 --> 07:27.137
because I know that you don't
like such small, smelly places.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.545
You know me so well.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.549
Eskimo kiss.

07:37.924 --> 07:40.950
Too bad Kelso doesn't know
anything about Jackie.

07:41.027 --> 07:44.963
Whoa. That is not true.
I know everything about her.

07:45.031 --> 07:48.728
In fact, I'll bet I know more about Jackie
than Eric knows about Donna.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.099
Whoa, Kelso.
Walk before you run, baby.

07:54.073 --> 07:56.405
You think you know me,
Michael? Then prove it.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.910
Oh, I have an idea.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.845
Let's play
<i>The Newlywed Game.</i>

08:01.914 --> 08:04.610
Eric and Donna versus
Kelso and Jackie.

08:04.684 --> 08:08.450
And I will be the impartial judge
who gets Jackie in the end.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.185
What?

08:12.258 --> 08:15.125
I mean, uh, good...
good luck to everyone.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.268
Hey, Leo,
what's in the bag, man?

08:32.345 --> 08:35.212
How can I put this?

08:36.549 --> 08:39.575
Let's just say in this bag
are illegal drugs.

08:41.821 --> 08:44.517
What? Come on, man.
You know I'm on probation!

08:44.590 --> 08:49.186
Nah, it's cool, man. All you have to do
is just not get pulled over.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.966
What did I just tell you, man?

08:59.906 --> 09:04.400
Gentlemen, our ladies have already
written down the answers to their questions.

09:06.078 --> 09:08.012
First up, Eric.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.914
<i>Eric, what is Donna's</i>
<i>favorite pizza topping?</i>

09:13.152 --> 09:15.086
Pepperoni.

09:15.154 --> 09:17.088
- <i>Donna?</i>
- Pepperoni!

09:19.525 --> 09:23.291
- We're such the perfect couple!
- I know!

09:23.362 --> 09:25.694
Now, Kelso...

09:25.765 --> 09:27.756
Mushrooms!

09:27.833 --> 09:31.360
No, no, no, no, no.
That is not your question.

09:31.437 --> 09:33.962
- And minus two for interrupting the host.
- Oh.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.167
- Minus two.
- Okay, sorry.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.211
It's okay. Minus two.

09:41.213 --> 09:46.241
Now, Kelso, last summer
you "accidently"...

09:46.319 --> 09:49.288
bounced Jackie off a trampoline.

09:49.355 --> 09:52.222
When she woke up in the hospital,
what were her first words?

09:52.291 --> 09:56.591
Oh, uh, you...
"Michael, you idiot."

10:00.833 --> 10:02.460
Michael, you remembered!

10:02.535 --> 10:05.470
Wow, he remembered.

10:07.106 --> 10:11.099
Okay, Eric, according to Donna
what is Donna's last name?

10:13.012 --> 10:14.707
Pinciotti.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.771
Oh, my God!

10:18.017 --> 10:19.951
Yes!

10:20.019 --> 10:22.146
Correct.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.514
Now, Kelso...

10:26.592 --> 10:30.426
Jackie has distant relatives
in the Cook Islands.

10:30.496 --> 10:34.296
In the early 1900s, what species of turtle
did they save from extinction?

10:36.736 --> 10:39.204
<i>Take your time.</i>

10:40.206 --> 10:42.140
Ladderback.

10:46.712 --> 10:49.408
Michael, you're amazing!

10:50.616 --> 10:52.277
Oh.

10:52.351 --> 10:55.946
No, no, no, no.
No hugging!

10:56.022 --> 10:57.751
I'm sorry, all right?
I forgot.

10:57.823 --> 11:01.259
That's right, and let's try
to remember that, little lady.

11:02.928 --> 11:06.864
Well, the score is horribly close.

11:06.932 --> 11:09.230
I'm very impressed, Michael.

11:09.301 --> 11:13.169
Yeah, well, I guess you just remember
things about those you care about.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.231
Oh, please. I'm gonna puke.

11:17.943 --> 11:21.970
Let's get this nightmare over with.

11:22.048 --> 11:23.982
Okay, Donna...

11:24.050 --> 11:27.042
if you could change one thing
about yourself, what would it be?

11:27.119 --> 11:30.680
Um, well, there's stuff
I'd change...

11:30.756 --> 11:32.781
but I know Eric,
and he'd say "Nothing."

11:32.858 --> 11:36.760
No, but, wait.
But that's not the question.

11:36.829 --> 11:39.457
Wh-Why?
What'd you answer?

11:39.532 --> 11:42.365
It doesn't matter what I answered,
because you answered wrong and I don't...

11:42.435 --> 11:44.369
I don't... I don't
want to play anymore.

11:47.573 --> 11:50.337
"Huge Wile E. Coyote feet"?

11:52.211 --> 11:54.771
What the hell does that mean?

11:54.847 --> 11:57.611
It means you have enormous feet.
Jackie...

11:59.752 --> 12:01.811
Whoa, whoa, Fez.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.821
Eric, you think
I have enormous feet?

12:03.889 --> 12:06.119
No. No, no.
<i>You</i> think that.

12:06.192 --> 12:09.753
Last week, you said you hated your
"huge Wile E. Coyote feet."

12:09.829 --> 12:13.356
- Eric, I only said that so you'd say they're not big.
- And they're <i>not</i> big.

12:13.432 --> 12:16.993
I'm sorry, but, dude, that's a lie.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.504
Oh, my God,
I don't believe this.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.872
No, Donna, no,
you're looking at this all wrong.

12:23.943 --> 12:28.710
Big feet make you, like, really stable.
You know?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.275
Really hard to... knock over.

12:33.352 --> 12:35.320
Get bent.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.787
See? I have small feet.

12:37.857 --> 12:41.486
That's where... Donna?
Are you going somewhere, honey?

12:44.897 --> 12:48.958
Okay, this is it.

12:50.469 --> 12:54.030
For all the marbles.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.040
Jackie.
What was your answer?

12:56.108 --> 12:58.201
Um, hmm...

12:58.277 --> 13:01.474
well if I had to change
one thing about me...

13:01.547 --> 13:05.313
it would have to be that...

13:05.384 --> 13:07.750
I'm too cute and
all other girls are jealous.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.378
Kelso?

13:28.841 --> 13:31.867
Oh, my God, Michael! That's amazing!

13:31.944 --> 13:34.606
Oh! I...
Oh, my God, I almost...

13:34.680 --> 13:37.046
Oh, my God.
I gotta go talk to Donna.

13:43.389 --> 13:46.984
Who would know that <i>you</i>
would win a battle of wits?

13:47.059 --> 13:49.653
Yeah.

13:49.728 --> 13:52.663
Turns out that the key
to winning Jackie's heart...

13:52.731 --> 13:54.699
was in the last place
I thought to look...

13:54.767 --> 13:56.826
my own brain.

14:05.310 --> 14:09.713
Donna, I think I'm actually
feeling something for Michael, you know?

14:11.850 --> 14:14.546
Donna, would you please stop
looking at your feet and listen to me?

14:14.619 --> 14:20.455
A boyfriend is supposed to tell you the
things you don't like about yourself are fine.

14:20.525 --> 14:24.052
Like last week, I told Eric
his pecs were getting bigger.

14:24.129 --> 14:26.063
But I mean, come on.

14:26.131 --> 14:30.158
If you lie him on his back,
you could fill up his chest with water.

14:31.536 --> 14:34.061
Maybe I'm just lonely.

14:34.139 --> 14:37.108
Or I need a sign from, like, God.

14:37.175 --> 14:39.109
Or, I don't know.

14:39.177 --> 14:41.304
Maybe I just need someone
to tell me if I'm crazy.

14:41.379 --> 14:44.075
Jackie, you're crazy.

14:45.183 --> 14:47.174
Not you, Bigfoot.

14:51.022 --> 14:53.081
Hi, honey. How was...

14:53.158 --> 14:56.218
Oh, not over yet.

14:56.294 --> 14:58.421
No, it's not, Red.

14:58.496 --> 15:00.430
Go make Laurie
do something with her life.

15:04.236 --> 15:07.569
I mean it. Now!

15:07.639 --> 15:10.733
Oh. You know, when a guy
comes home from work...

15:10.809 --> 15:14.142
he just wants to sit down
and have a nice quiet beer.

15:14.212 --> 15:17.272
Well, she drank your beer
because she doesn't have a future.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.854
Fine, Kitty. I'm going!

15:22.921 --> 15:25.719
Okay, honey. First of all...

15:25.790 --> 15:29.521
always save
one beer for Daddy.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.429
Okay.

15:32.497 --> 15:35.125
Second of all...

15:35.200 --> 15:38.761
we feel that you need
to get some direction in your life.

15:39.905 --> 15:42.271
And by "we,"
I mean your mother.

15:43.308 --> 15:46.038
See, honey.
I'm not really worried.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.944
'Cause I know you're gonna
find a nice guy and get married.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.743
- Exactly.
- Right.

15:50.815 --> 15:56.481
Someone who can take care of you,
who's rich, who's... not Kelso.

15:58.256 --> 16:01.089
And I think this is a plan
that might just work out for you.

16:02.093 --> 16:04.960
Okay.

16:05.030 --> 16:08.727
But, Daddy, I mean, if I wanted to
have a career of my own, I could, right?

16:10.235 --> 16:13.068
Well, sure.

16:13.138 --> 16:17.336
I just don't want you
to set yourself up for...

16:18.576 --> 16:20.510
Like what happened
at the college...

16:21.813 --> 16:27.342
I-If you set the bar too high,
the fall might be...

16:29.154 --> 16:34.421
You see, you're just...
so pretty.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.587
Here's five dollars.

16:45.036 --> 16:46.970
Good evening, gentlemen.

16:47.038 --> 16:50.030
Is there a problem, "ossifer?"

16:55.347 --> 16:57.440
Did you just say "ossifer?"

16:57.515 --> 17:00.541
Uh, no sir, I'm sorry.

17:00.618 --> 17:02.848
I distinctly heard him
say officer, sir.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.752
Uh-huh.

17:04.823 --> 17:08.122
I pulled you over
because your left brake light is out.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.855
I'm gonna have to
write you up a warning.

17:10.929 --> 17:14.365
Close one, man.

17:14.432 --> 17:17.560
I thought for sure he was gonna ask
what's in the bag.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.935
I'm still right here.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.598
Uh-oh.

17:35.487 --> 17:38.615
- Dog food?
- We were framed!

17:42.060 --> 17:46.121
I mean...
Of course it's dog food.

17:46.197 --> 17:48.757
What'd you think it was? Illegal drugs?

17:51.136 --> 17:53.832
All right, weirdos.

17:53.905 --> 17:55.839
Drive safe.

18:02.781 --> 18:05.477
Dog food?

18:05.550 --> 18:09.680
Yeah. I mean...
Oh, wait, man.

18:09.754 --> 18:14.123
If the dog food's
in this bag, then where's...

18:14.192 --> 18:17.389
Oh, wow. I gotta check on my dog, man!

18:24.669 --> 18:27.160
- Jackie, I...
- Don't speak, Michael.

18:27.238 --> 18:29.536
I am very close to
letting myself experience...

18:29.607 --> 18:31.666
strong feelings
of not hating you.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.677
I just need a sign.

18:33.745 --> 18:35.906
I brought the lotion.

18:38.683 --> 18:41.618
No, okay. I want you to guess
a number between one and ten.

18:41.686 --> 18:43.210
- Seven.
- Guess again.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.552
- Three.
- Close enough. Let's go.

18:45.623 --> 18:49.354
Jackie, if you go out that door
with him...

18:49.427 --> 18:52.157
whatever we might have had
between us is over forever.

18:58.937 --> 19:02.395
Look! The reason I haven't
done anything with my life...

19:02.474 --> 19:04.499
is because I didn't know
what I wanted to do.

19:04.576 --> 19:07.477
Well, the post office has
a dental plan that's supposed...

19:07.545 --> 19:09.672
Shh!

19:11.049 --> 19:16.180
But, Daddy, you forced me
to sit down and think about it...

19:16.254 --> 19:19.280
and now, I have
found my passion!

19:19.357 --> 19:21.291
Hair!

19:25.630 --> 19:28.326
The musical?

19:28.399 --> 19:31.766
No! Hair!

19:31.836 --> 19:33.770
I'm going to beauty school!

19:33.838 --> 19:37.171
This isn't something you do
through the mail, is it?

19:38.443 --> 19:41.105
No! It's a real school.

19:41.179 --> 19:46.515
- Oh, well, yea!
- Congratulations, sweetheart.

19:49.787 --> 19:51.914
- So, Kitty, what do you think?
- Eh.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.958
Yeah.

19:58.530 --> 20:03.832
Well, looks like Jackie
and Kelso are back together.

20:03.902 --> 20:08.839
I won and Fez lost
I won and Fez lost

20:13.845 --> 20:16.973
- You guys, what happened?
- I don't know. The van just started shakin'.

20:17.048 --> 20:19.016
Uh, guys.

20:30.995 --> 20:34.658
Quick! Everyone give me your belts.
Together we can pull it out.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.800
Come on!

20:41.139 --> 20:43.073
Gi...

20:45.310 --> 20:48.677
Michael, this is it!
This is the sign I was looking for!

20:48.746 --> 20:50.714
God doesn't
want us to be together!

20:52.383 --> 20:55.409
Who cares?
I'm losing my van!

20:56.754 --> 20:58.688
See? That was always
the problem with us, Michael.

20:58.756 --> 21:00.690
It was always about you.

21:00.758 --> 21:03.591
- Jackie, are you losing your van?
- No!

21:03.661 --> 21:06.391
Then shut up!

21:08.399 --> 21:13.666
Wow, watching Kelso's van sink
makes the size of my feet seem unimportant.

21:13.738 --> 21:17.697
See, Donna?
Size doesn't matter.

21:17.775 --> 21:21.176
- Oh, you don't have to tell me.
- That's... Yeah. That's...

21:21.246 --> 21:23.373
There's my sweet girl.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.508
Fez, I'm cold.

21:27.752 --> 21:29.743
Frankly my dear...

21:29.821 --> 21:32.289
I don't give a rat's ass.

21:42.533 --> 21:46.469
<i>Dr. Zhivago, I'm home!</i>

21:46.537 --> 21:48.471
<i>I brought your food!</i>
