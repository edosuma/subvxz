WEBVTT

02:50.160 --> 02:51.514
You have a good year?

02:54.720 --> 02:56.598
Uh, yeah. Sure.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.073
Well, you sure
grew some.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.273
This year
we have a moose tag.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.516
A moose.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.155
Yeah. I got
one picked out.

03:26.680 --> 03:27.955
A bull.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.239
I stalked him
for two weeks.

03:33.240 --> 03:36.358
Up there.
At the Crazies.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.954
<i>Way up.</i>

04:11.640 --> 04:12.756
There's still
plenty of time to scare up

04:12.920 --> 04:15.037
some grouse before dark.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.353
Come on, David.

04:20.519 --> 04:21.749
Put your legs into it.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.357
Let's go!
We're burning daylight.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.871
<i>Remember, David, what did
I tell you about grouse?</i>

04:30.080 --> 04:31.355
I don't know.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.716
Grouse are
stupid and slow.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.076
Not like ducks
or grebes.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.072
They even sound stupid.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.992
Not like a quail, huh?

04:44.920 --> 04:47.037
Come on. Let's hear
your best quail.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.354
I really
don't remember how.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.074
Of course you do.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.719
You were getting good
at it last year.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.636
Louder.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.832
Louder.

05:10.000 --> 05:10.831
Loud enough for me to know
where you are

05:11.000 --> 05:11.911
if we get separated.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.318
It's how hunters say,
"I'm here"

05:15.320 --> 05:16.959
without tipping off
the prey.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.200
Your mother.
How is she?

05:21.360 --> 05:24.717
Uh, I don't know.
She's... alright.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.075
Are you friends
with her?

05:26.240 --> 05:28.072
Am I friends with her?

05:29.080 --> 05:31.959
Um. Yeah. I guess.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.119
Is she still
a beautiful lady?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.432
I don't know.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.080
What do you mean,
you don't know?

05:41.240 --> 05:42.833
Of course you know.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.438
Yeah, she's still a
beautiful lady, I guess.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.513
She tell you
any messages for me?

05:54.120 --> 05:55.315
Yeah. She..

05:57.520 --> 05:59.477
...said that I should..

05:59.640 --> 06:01.472
I should send you
her love.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.994
Well, thank you, David.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.953
That's kind of you
to say.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.594
The next one's yours.

06:19.200 --> 06:19.997
<i>We're not going home
until you get</i>

06:20.160 --> 06:22.675
<i>your first bird.</i>

06:25.080 --> 06:25.911
Now!

06:28.440 --> 06:30.397
Find him.
Get behind him.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.233
Come on up on him.
Come on up on him.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.156
You blinked.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.476
David! David!

06:51.800 --> 06:53.837
It's alright, relax
and get your dinner.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.878
<i>Come on.</i>

06:56.040 --> 06:57.156
<i>Breathe.</i>

07:00.000 --> 07:01.559
Safety.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.553
Don't close your eyes.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.117
You can't quit.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.919
It's hard, I know.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.713
Then it gets easier.
Alright?

07:16.880 --> 07:18.030
All of a sudden
it gets very easy.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.237
It's not easy.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.198
It'll never be easy.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.272
You'll get a bird.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.796
I know you will.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.156
Just use your
muscle memory.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.792
Easy, easy.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.956
You hit him.

07:40.600 --> 07:41.965
<i>- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

07:42.000 --> 07:44.310
You winged him.
He faltered and dropped.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.156
I don't understand it.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.596
You crippled him.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.557
He couldn't have
gone far.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.791
I probably just
didn't hit him.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.598
You hit it, David.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.557
I don't know how
you couldn't see that.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.556
You never leave
what you shot behind.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.279
If you had a dog, we could
find it right away.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.640
We had a dog
when I was little.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.359
Why don't you
have one now?

08:22.880 --> 08:24.997
Since you're..

08:25.160 --> 08:27.994
...you know...
already alone.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.398
Isn't that
what dogs are for?

08:34.559 --> 08:37.678
I don't know what
dogs are for, David.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.990
All I know is I don't give
that much love

08:39.280 --> 08:40.395
to a creature
who would only live

08:40.400 --> 08:41.470
a dozen
or so years.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.598
That bird must have
run off and hidden itself

08:50.800 --> 08:52.154
to die in the darkness.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.949
I'm sorry.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.349
<i>You used to sleep
like a puppy</i>

09:45.360 --> 09:46.999
<i>in the crook of my arm.</i>

09:53.520 --> 09:55.079
I remember that day.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.400
It's like a memory
of a memory.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.800
Yeah.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.990
That whole damn set-up
was your mother's idea.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.599
She even got me to put
gunk in my hair.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.599
<i>That's a good picture
of grandpa.</i>

10:17.280 --> 10:18.873
<i>- Did you take that?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

10:21.440 --> 10:24.114
You remember him at all?

10:24.360 --> 10:26.192
<i>Your grandfather?</i>

10:26.360 --> 10:27.953
I remember his funeral.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.511
Oh, wasn't
his best day exactly.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.719
That's all I really
remember about him.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.156
That and his face
scratching me

10:43.320 --> 10:44.071
when he kissed me.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.605
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

10:45.640 --> 10:47.279
- Sandpaper.
- Yeah.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.591
<i>He always smelt
of pipe tobacco.</i>

10:53.000 --> 10:53.956
<i>Gunpowder.</i>

10:56.000 --> 10:57.400
<i>Jack pine.</i>

11:00.360 --> 11:01.760
<i>What about those moose?</i>

11:03.880 --> 11:05.712
What about moose?

11:05.880 --> 11:07.792
Are they stupid and slow,
like grouse?

11:07.960 --> 11:10.600
No.
No, moose are different.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.111
They're regal.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.759
Up in Alaska
they get so tall

11:15.920 --> 11:17.354
a grown man can walk
under a moose's belly

11:17.360 --> 11:19.317
and never touch fur.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.079
Oh, yeah. You'll see.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.632
So... why kill them then?

11:30.600 --> 11:34.514
If they're so... royal?

11:34.680 --> 11:36.831
Well, they make 600 pounds
of delicious meat.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.156
A winter's worth.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.152
<i>It is way better than
a Thanksgiving turkey.</i>

11:44.160 --> 11:45.799
I told mom I'd call her
when I got here.

11:45.960 --> 11:49.078
Well, you won't find
a signal up here.

11:49.080 --> 11:52.152
Should have called her
from town.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.710
About time you cut loose from
Katie's apron strings anyhow.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.839
What, so there's..

11:58.000 --> 11:59.354
...there's no way
I can talk to her?

11:59.560 --> 12:01.552
Well, there's always the
two-way in an emergency.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.675
Emergency.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.317
Are moose dangerous?

12:08.480 --> 12:09.470
They're no joke.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.159
Won't be like
one of your asinine games.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.551
<i>Can't start ower at the
first sign of trouble.</i>

12:19.720 --> 12:22.519
This year
we hunt big game.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.159
This year you'll get
your first kill.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.350
David.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.840
Put that away.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.033
Well, put that
damn toy away.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.117
I don't want
to see it again.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.999
If I do, I'll smash it
to smithereens.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.553
<i>You wearing long johns?</i>

13:30.800 --> 13:33.520
It'll be freezing
up above.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.071
Long johns,
wool socks, mittens.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.310
Mom went over
that checklist you sent

13:38.480 --> 13:40.631
and doubled it.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.233
She remembers
how cold it gets up here.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.832
Mittens.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.672
Mittens for her kittens.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.634
Here.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.114
Here's something
she didn't double.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.560
That's simpler than
the over-and-under

14:06.720 --> 14:08.074
you used yesterday.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.590
It's heavier.
Packs a hell of a punch.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.271
This is the rifle I shot
my first moose with

14:14.440 --> 14:15.840
when I was 14.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.839
Your grandfather
gave me this gun.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.279
Safety. Click.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.591
It's not moving
like those grouse though.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.877
Well, if we come up
on that moose quiet

14:37.040 --> 14:38.838
like we're meant to,
he won't be moving either.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.120
Be a tad bit bigger
than a coffee can too.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.272
His heart's
about the same size.

14:45.440 --> 14:46.999
Now breathe out slowly.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.993
<i>You won't need that
where we're going.</i>

15:43.440 --> 15:45.716
<i>What if it
keeps snowing?</i>

15:45.720 --> 15:47.598
<i>Or we get lost?</i>

15:47.600 --> 15:50.320
You worry too much.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.119
Like your mother.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.875
I'm just not used
to being so..

15:55.040 --> 15:56.315
...remote.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.439
Well, you're not remote.
You're with me.

15:59.720 --> 16:02.189
And we are here.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.557
Just up that drainage.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.313
At the head
of the creek.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.071
How far is it?

16:14.280 --> 16:16.795
Five miles,
give or take.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.553
We won't barely
break a sweat.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.791
Is that where
you saw the moose?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.992
No. That's where I saw
the sheepman's hut.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.675
The moose is up further.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.439
How much further?

16:29.440 --> 16:31.830
All the way further.
It's up on top.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.479
We have to sleep
in a hut?

16:38.680 --> 16:39.909
Yeah.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.196
Why didn't we just
bring a tent?

16:41.440 --> 16:43.079
Why should we
haul a tent up there

16:43.240 --> 16:44.356
when we already have
a perfectly good hut?

16:44.560 --> 16:45.516
I..

16:47.080 --> 16:48.878
I don't want
to sleep all

16:49.040 --> 16:49.917
squashed up
next to you..

16:51.720 --> 16:53.712
...in a smelly
sheepman's hut.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.550
You just think what
you'll tell those kids

17:04.800 --> 17:07.315
back in Briar Meadow.
Hm?

17:07.480 --> 17:09.436
How primal you'll feel

17:09.440 --> 17:11.511
knowing you came home
from a good kill.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.031
I don't want
to kill a moose.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.357
It's an old
sheepman's hut

17:34.520 --> 17:36.113
and it's near
where we're going to hunt

17:36.120 --> 17:39.158
<i>and I can fix it up
dry and warm and good.</i>

17:40.440 --> 17:43.114
<i>I thought you might
like that.</i>

17:43.280 --> 17:45.112
<i>I thought it might be
more fun than a tent.</i>

17:47.080 --> 17:49.470
But we don't have
to do it, alright?

17:49.480 --> 17:51.119
We can drive back to town
and buy a tent

17:51.280 --> 17:52.839
or I can drive you back
to the cabin

17:52.840 --> 17:53.990
and we can hunt birds.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.110
<i>Whatewer you
want to do.</i>

18:03.480 --> 18:05.870
Or I can put you
right back on a plane.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.633
One leaves every
single day.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.030
No, I..

18:14.920 --> 18:16.070
...want to.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.149
Are you sure?

18:25.040 --> 18:26.110
No. I just..

18:28.840 --> 18:30.069
...just want to.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.073
Oh! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.113
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.919
- You okay?
- Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.834
Who made this trail
anyway? The sheepman?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.231
No, deer and elk.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.352
They know the shortest way
between the seasons.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.359
I thought you said the
moose were above the hut.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.397
At the top.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.677
We have to be
careful now.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.560
We may scare up a bear.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.155
- A bear?
- Yeah.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.913
Dad, you didn't
say anything about a bear.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.310
Yeah, there's no need
to worry. Okay?

19:15.480 --> 19:17.551
You don't have to
be faster than Sir Bear.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.396
Just faster
than your old man.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.835
Come on.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.590
Come on.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.320
I don't think I am faster
than my old man.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.510
You're stronger
than you know.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.954
I know.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.634
I was you once.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.393
Yeah, well.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.313
I lose every race
at school, so..

19:42.480 --> 19:45.314
Well, they don't have
actual bears

19:45.480 --> 19:47.437
out in Briarwood, Texas,
now, do they?

19:48.840 --> 19:49.910
No.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.519
I'll put myself
between you and any bear.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.670
I promise.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.760
<i>So what's the story
with the sheepmen?</i>

20:08.920 --> 20:12.118
Spaniards from near
the border with France.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.431
They weren't
wanted there

20:15.600 --> 20:18.399
so they migrated here
in clans.

20:18.560 --> 20:22.713
Kept to themselves.
Were quick with knives.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.632
Sometimes you can still
find their sardine cans

20:24.640 --> 20:25.710
and snuff boxes.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.074
This was some kind of
wild out here back then.

20:33.320 --> 20:34.310
Back then?

20:40.120 --> 20:42.316
<i>Here's to the sheepman.</i>

20:42.480 --> 20:44.312
<i>So far from home.</i>

20:56.280 --> 20:57.600
<i>Red fescue.</i>

21:00.320 --> 21:01.640
<i>Crusted wheat grass.</i>

21:04.240 --> 21:05.230
<i>Cotton woods.</i>

21:07.320 --> 21:08.310
<i>Killdeer.</i>

21:10.480 --> 21:11.436
<i>Choke cherry.</i>

21:13.880 --> 21:15.030
<i>Kingfisher.</i>

21:17.440 --> 21:18.430
<i>Buffaloberry.</i>

21:24.760 --> 21:27.150
<i>Your grandfather always
let me be fire master.</i>

21:28.920 --> 21:31.037
He brought me up on this
mountain when I was 14.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.158
Well, that was
the last year

21:34.320 --> 21:35.595
he hunted big game..

21:39.080 --> 21:40.753
First time
I tasted whiskey.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.479
You want some?

21:44.280 --> 21:46.078
No. No.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.839
And I was
the same age as you.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.359
Did you know he was
50 years older than me?

21:57.960 --> 21:59.792
<i>And I'm almost
30 years older than you.</i>

22:02.440 --> 22:03.635
And someday
you'll have a son

22:03.840 --> 22:06.799
and you'll be
30 years older than him..

22:06.960 --> 22:08.519
...and you'll want
so badly for him to know

22:08.720 --> 22:10.359
who you are
that you could cry.

22:14.560 --> 22:15.789
You know?

22:26.120 --> 22:27.759
What do you know, David?

22:29.200 --> 22:30.759
What do you really know?

22:33.240 --> 22:34.356
Um..

22:36.160 --> 22:38.038
Nothing much, I guess.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.233
Nothing much, I guess.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.193
I don't know
what you want me to say.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.993
Why was it
the last year he hunted?

22:59.040 --> 23:00.190
<i>Grandpa Clyde?</i>

23:01.440 --> 23:03.671
He was 64 damn
years old..

23:07.360 --> 23:08.919
...but that wasn't
the reason.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.958
<i>We took a moose
and a goat that year.</i>

23:15.160 --> 23:16.799
<i>God, that goat.</i>

23:16.960 --> 23:19.475
<i>Every inch of its hide
was covered with ticks.</i>

23:23.640 --> 23:24.676
<i>I don't know
why he quit.</i>

23:26.920 --> 23:28.877
I'd say it was my mother
dying so young.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.270
You know, I guess

23:37.440 --> 23:39.079
when death
is in the air..

23:40.800 --> 23:43.031
When a man feels himself
getting older..

23:45.760 --> 23:47.353
...he didn't much
want to kill anymore.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.149
<i>And I was just then
getting the taste for it.</i>

24:03.040 --> 24:04.918
Out.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.070
Hey, dog.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.155
Cranes.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.439
<i>Your mother loved them.</i>

24:13.720 --> 24:14.836
Flying home.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.231
<i>Later..</i>

24:26.240 --> 24:28.197
<i>...years later</i>

24:28.400 --> 24:30.312
<i>he'd still go out
after birds by himself.</i>

24:30.480 --> 24:32.039
<i>So he didn't
stop hunting completely.</i>

24:37.440 --> 24:39.671
<i>He usually just went out and
missed ewery shot on purpose.</i>

24:54.680 --> 24:56.433
<i>Rise and shine.</i>

24:59.640 --> 25:01.871
Rise and shine.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.673
<i>We're gonna get our
moose today.</i>

25:16.200 --> 25:18.590
You know, landmarks
can save you.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.036
In case we get separated
or if you get lost

25:21.200 --> 25:24.034
you go to high ground
and find them.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.432
That bull pie snag
with the forked crown?

25:27.600 --> 25:30.160
It marks the head
of the creek valley.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.955
<i>From there, we can wait
and watch</i>

25:33.120 --> 25:34.474
<i>the whole meadow
without being seen.</i>

25:37.480 --> 25:39.949
Is this..

25:39.960 --> 25:42.759
This whole
mountain's ours?

25:42.920 --> 25:45.037
Well, today, yes.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.796
We own it.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.276
I'm hunting moose
with my father.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.553
I'm getting
my moose today.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.631
Where's that bull pie?

26:14.840 --> 26:16.035
Over there.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.077
Let's go!

26:20.320 --> 26:21.879
Better wait
for your old man.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.516
Sir Moose comes once
in the morning.

26:33.600 --> 26:36.240
And once again
in the evening.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.880
Least that's
what his tracks say.

26:40.560 --> 26:43.075
He may not come
for hours.

26:43.240 --> 26:44.879
Or at all.
You can't tell.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.069
If you could,
it wouldn't be hunting

26:48.080 --> 26:49.673
it would be shopping.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.240
He may even know
this is the last week

26:55.440 --> 26:56.556
of the season.

26:58.920 --> 26:59.910
So he may be
on his guard

27:00.080 --> 27:02.595
and go somewhere
less open to drink.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.318
But he may not be
all that clever.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.152
He could make a mistake.

27:12.200 --> 27:12.997
Hey.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.793
David.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.432
<i>What is that?</i>

27:43.440 --> 27:45.397
<i>An old male griz.</i>

27:48.000 --> 27:49.798
- Are we gonna shoot him?
- No. No.

27:51.800 --> 27:52.916
Why not?

27:53.080 --> 27:54.594
Because we don't
want to.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.199
Because that's not hunting
for the meat.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.353
That's hunting
for the fear.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.790
- He saw us.
- No, he smelled us.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.316
They can smell a hundred
times better than we can.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.231
Let's take a look
at that beaver pond.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.800
Stay close.

28:39.240 --> 28:40.993
Yeah, there's something
rotten down here.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.155
Goddammit.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.757
Three days. Maybe four.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.470
Four days since what?

28:58.640 --> 29:00.597
Someone tracked me
tracking it.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.720
Come closer,
you need to know this.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.470
<i>Fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen</i>

29:13.640 --> 29:16.075
seventeen, eighteen.

29:20.040 --> 29:23.397
Eighteen goddamn
bullets.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.631
<i>From some pissant's</i>

29:25.800 --> 29:28.031
<i>goddamn squirrel rifle.</i>

29:31.240 --> 29:33.516
<i>Why'd they do that?</i>

29:33.760 --> 29:35.717
Goddamn asswipes!

29:37.800 --> 29:38.472
You think
they're still around?

29:38.480 --> 29:39.914
I hope so.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.160
You hear me,
you redneck fuckers?

29:45.360 --> 29:46.953
You goddamn hear me?

29:52.120 --> 29:53.349
Goddamn it.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.080
Goddamn it.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.757
Two weeks I follow you

30:24.920 --> 30:27.435
two mother-loving weeks.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.637
Get to know your habits

30:29.800 --> 30:32.315
your scent, your scat.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.234
Get taken by some
goddamn tourist.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.199
Follow one's star,
huh, Katie?

30:40.400 --> 30:42.517
Yeah, you bet
you followed it.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.036
<i>Right on back to Texas.</i>

30:45.040 --> 30:47.430
<i>You couldn't
hack it here.</i>

30:48.960 --> 30:50.758
What did you ever know
about me anyhow?

30:51.920 --> 30:53.798
Did you ever
even know me?

31:18.960 --> 31:20.235
Musk thistle.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.597
Milkweed.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.274
<i>Kinnikinnick.</i>

31:31.440 --> 31:33.352
Oh, Steller's jay.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.795
Steller's jay.

31:37.720 --> 31:38.915
<i>Steller's jay.</i>

32:12.960 --> 32:15.316
You look like
a damn koala bear.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.993
Or one of those
cat posters?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.150
"Hang in there."

32:20.080 --> 32:21.196
Hang in there.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.680
That's funny.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.154
You sure as hell aren't
gonna sneak up on anything

32:28.320 --> 32:29.834
clowning around
like that..

32:31.600 --> 32:33.034
...especially not the bull
elk we've been following

32:33.200 --> 32:35.078
these last two miles.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.469
A bull elk?

32:38.960 --> 32:39.996
See these tracks
along here?

32:42.000 --> 32:45.038
Walk one,
wait five. Okay?

32:46.960 --> 32:48.997
Don't skyline yourself.
Stay low.

32:51.880 --> 32:52.757
Shh.

32:55.000 --> 32:55.751
Sometimes
the best stalking

32:55.920 --> 32:57.513
is standing still.

32:57.680 --> 32:58.909
Yeah.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.440
There we go.

33:06.600 --> 33:07.750
Shh, shh.
Gun down, gun down.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.952
Put your gun down.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.032
Right on top of that
ledge right there.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.838
- You see it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.360
<i>Quiet yourself.</i>

33:20.600 --> 33:22.193
You gotta be so quiet
right now.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.159
It's way up close.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.880
- Alright? Just follow me.
- Yeah.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.516
Alright.
You got eyes on him?

33:38.680 --> 33:40.273
Alright, safety off,
safety off.

33:42.880 --> 33:46.112
Now, deep breath now.
Yeah.

33:46.280 --> 33:49.318
Just let it out as
you squeeze the trigger.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.233
And then you pull it soft,
but sure.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.629
Alright?

34:09.920 --> 34:12.639
You got it!

34:12.800 --> 34:14.917
Always approach
from behind

34:15.080 --> 34:17.833
so he can't lash at you
with his hooves.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.958
Get hold of his rack,
in case he's not dead.

34:29.679 --> 34:31.956
<i>Good. Get it out
of your system.</i>

34:31.960 --> 34:33.518
I need you to help me
dress out our elk

34:33.520 --> 34:35.034
before nightfall.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.192
We'll drag him to cover

34:37.199 --> 34:39.795
and quarter Sir Elk
in the morning.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.235
You ready to gut him?

34:56.960 --> 34:58.553
It's right here.
Take it, David.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.594
Hm..

35:48.760 --> 35:50.558
<i>I guess I'm getting to be
like your grandfather.</i>

35:52.360 --> 35:55.273
He was a railroader.
Route manager.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.276
After school
I'd stop by the station.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.194
He'd be asleep,
face flat on his desk

36:02.200 --> 36:03.554
timetables
damp with drool.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.393
After we checked mom
into St. Anne's

36:13.560 --> 36:14.994
for the last time
it became chronic..

36:17.400 --> 36:19.471
<i>They called it
narcolepsy.</i>

36:19.640 --> 36:22.245
It got him his pension..

36:22.280 --> 36:23.645
...but I think he just
didn't care much

36:23.680 --> 36:26.275
for being awake alone
for so many empty hours.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.997
It used to be
a tablespoon

36:40.160 --> 36:43.119
and then she wrote in
half a tablespoon.

36:53.320 --> 36:54.231
Ah..

37:12.800 --> 37:15.031
I still love that part.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.394
Stomach cancer.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.715
Your Grandmother Chloe
was only 51, David.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.390
<i>And her last three years
were total hell.</i>

37:39.680 --> 37:41.433
Don't you dare let me
go out that way.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.673
You never told me
about your moose.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.718
You said you,
you killed a moose

37:58.720 --> 37:59.756
when you were my age.

37:59.760 --> 38:00.637
Oh, yeah.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.120
<i>For my birthday</i>

38:07.280 --> 38:09.556
<i>my father gave me
the.30-30 I gave you.</i>

38:11.800 --> 38:13.439
<i>He said it was lucky.</i>

38:15.120 --> 38:17.874
<i>Said it
was a man's gun.</i>

38:18.040 --> 38:19.838
<i>I was so sure
I'd get my moose</i>

38:20.000 --> 38:21.036
<i>my hands were shaking.</i>

38:22.840 --> 38:24.559
<i>Your grandfather
called it buck fewer.</i>

38:26.800 --> 38:30.510
<i>My heart was in my
throat. My mind was mush.</i>

38:30.520 --> 38:32.193
What does a moose
look like?

38:34.800 --> 38:37.759
Did you just ask me
what a moose looks like?

38:37.960 --> 38:39.838
What's he gonna do
when he sees me?

38:40.040 --> 38:41.394
What kind of thing is he
gonna do? I need to know.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.231
Right.

38:46.320 --> 38:49.040
He's gonna be pitch-black,
a little stupid.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.637
He might not even see you
or he could charge you.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.314
Alright?

39:02.120 --> 39:04.396
Hey..

39:04.560 --> 39:06.472
...just don't
mix this up.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.678
I'm the ugly one in
the Elmer-Fudd hat.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.956
Alright?

39:46.160 --> 39:47.753
<i>I was furious
with myself.</i>

39:49.880 --> 39:51.553
And I was sure that
moose would be gone.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.433
You're done in.

40:09.880 --> 40:13.351
<i>You'd best get to bed.
Big day tomorrow.</i>

40:20.200 --> 40:21.316
<i>Let's go, Dawid.</i>

40:22.560 --> 40:23.516
Now.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.440
Come on.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.438
The snow is
not our friend.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.031
I had half a mind
at breakfast

40:42.200 --> 40:43.156
to let the bull lie

40:43.320 --> 40:45.551
and pack us straight
down out of here.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.519
Probably smarter,
easier in the long run.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.510
I could come back on
snowshoes next week

40:53.720 --> 40:55.313
but by then it might be
three feet deep

40:55.480 --> 40:56.800
and starting to drift.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.277
We'll get two quarters
out today.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.039
It'll make it easier
for you later.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.159
Is that alright?

41:08.360 --> 41:09.919
I expect I ought to
leave it up to you.

41:12.240 --> 41:15.472
The snow...
it's beautiful.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.516
If it stops soon,
we're fine, but..

41:21.680 --> 41:24.434
No, dad... I don't want
you to do

41:24.640 --> 41:27.030
anything different
because of me.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.759
I wanna know
how to do this.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.600
<i>David.</i>

41:47.480 --> 41:48.630
Fresh kill.

41:57.440 --> 41:58.635
Here you go.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.073
That blood's still warm.

42:07.640 --> 42:08.790
What happened?

42:10.880 --> 42:13.520
<i>It looks like
the work of our griz.</i>

42:13.680 --> 42:17.310
No. No, it must be
a mother bear.

42:17.480 --> 42:18.709
She's got a cub
with her.

42:20.480 --> 42:22.278
How can you tell?

42:22.440 --> 42:24.113
Do you see
those smaller tracks?

42:25.920 --> 42:29.197
It looks to be wounded,
dragging its feet.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.518
That might even be
two cubs.

42:49.800 --> 42:50.870
Dad.

42:52.600 --> 42:53.795
What is that?

42:56.600 --> 42:57.431
Dad.

42:59.160 --> 43:00.674
Oh, Christ.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.198
That's one of the cubs.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.591
A yearling.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.956
Brains have been
licked clean out.

43:13.840 --> 43:17.675
Come on, David. Now!
Quick, follow me now.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.399
What?

43:26.440 --> 43:29.319
Good sight lines,
all directions.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.835
The brains.
Why did she do that?

43:32.040 --> 43:35.238
Oh, she didn't.
Another bear got her cub.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.915
A male. She fought him
for the body and won.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.711
If we see her, you pick
the nearest big tree

43:42.880 --> 43:44.075
and you climb it,
alright?

43:44.240 --> 43:45.435
If she comes up
after you

43:45.640 --> 43:46.835
you stick your gun in her
mouth and you fire.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.116
- Okay.
- You can't miss.

43:48.280 --> 43:49.077
- Okay.
- You got it?

43:49.240 --> 43:51.038
Yeah.

43:51.040 --> 43:52.474
<i>- Is your rifle cocked?
- Uh, hang on.</i>

43:52.640 --> 43:54.950
<i>Cock it.
Put on the safety.</i>

43:59.560 --> 44:00.755
Yeah, we'll make fast work
of Mr. Elk

44:00.920 --> 44:02.036
and be headed home.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.998
Hey.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.595
Eating snow takes more
energy than it gives you.

44:28.760 --> 44:30.752
That's surefire
dehydration.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.192
I'm thirsty. Dad.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.517
Alright. Alright.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.831
Why don't you fill
our canteens?

44:41.000 --> 44:42.753
It's heavy work
hauling meat.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.513
You stay
where I can see you.

46:12.080 --> 46:12.797
David!

46:14.080 --> 46:15.116
<i>David!</i>

46:15.280 --> 46:17.749
Aah! Aah!

46:30.600 --> 46:31.829
<i>Get up, David!</i>

46:33.000 --> 46:36.152
Grab hold! You climb!

46:36.160 --> 46:38.197
<i>That sow, she's gonna
come back for her cub.</i>

46:38.360 --> 46:39.760
- Now, come on!
- Dad.

46:39.960 --> 46:41.872
<i>Climb as high as you can.
Come on!</i>

46:45.040 --> 46:46.360
- David, take this.
- Ah..

46:46.600 --> 46:48.478
Dad, I can't hold on to
the tree and the gun. Dad.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.869
- David.
- Dad, I can't do it.

46:50.040 --> 46:52.555
- David, take it.
- Dad. No, dad.

46:52.720 --> 46:53.949
- I can't breathe, dad.
- Hurry!

46:54.160 --> 46:55.389
Dad, I can't hold on
to the.. Ah!

46:56.240 --> 46:57.833
Dad!

46:57.840 --> 46:58.751
Dad.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.560
Dad!

47:04.080 --> 47:04.957
Dad!

47:07.120 --> 47:08.440
<i>- Uh..
- Dad!</i>

47:11.800 --> 47:13.519
<i>Dad! Dad, the bear!</i>

47:13.720 --> 47:15.598
Come on, dad, get up.
Get up, dad.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.274
Dad, the mama bear!
Get up!

47:46.400 --> 47:47.595
Dad.

47:55.600 --> 47:56.875
Wake up!

48:16.120 --> 48:18.919
- Dad, I'm scared.
- Alright, it's alright.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.998
We're both gonna
bleed to death.

48:29.160 --> 48:31.755
<i>Let me see your hand,
David.</i>

48:31.920 --> 48:33.400
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.
Okay?</i>

48:58.880 --> 49:00.758
How bad
is the exit wound?

49:03.560 --> 49:06.234
It's bad.
It's a really big hole.

49:06.400 --> 49:07.993
It's, it's
a lot of blood.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.310
<i>Tourniquet.</i>

49:30.680 --> 49:32.751
It went through my knee.

49:32.920 --> 49:34.513
I'm not gonna be
able to walk.

49:37.480 --> 49:39.437
Here. Help me
get to that tree.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.719
<i>- Come on. Here.
- Ah!</i>

49:45.640 --> 49:47.074
<i>Come on.</i>

49:54.440 --> 49:57.751
David, you can find your
way back to the cabin.

49:59.800 --> 50:00.916
- You can.
- Dad, no.

50:01.080 --> 50:02.753
Dad, I'm not
leaving you.

50:02.920 --> 50:04.718
Alright, you listen.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.075
You listen carefully,
alright?

50:06.240 --> 50:07.833
We don't have to worry
about freezing.

50:07.840 --> 50:09.194
And your hand is
gonna be alright, okay?

50:09.400 --> 50:10.800
The doctor will fix it up
good as new.

50:10.960 --> 50:12.792
I promise you that.

50:12.800 --> 50:14.120
If I try to walk out
on this leg

50:14.320 --> 50:16.391
it's gonna bleed
and keep bleeding.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.232
I could bleed to death.
You hear me?

50:18.480 --> 50:20.551
I'm staying here
and burrowing in

50:20.720 --> 50:22.837
and you're walking out
to get help.

50:22.840 --> 50:25.196
I'm sorry.
It's what we have to do.

50:25.360 --> 50:28.114
You can't possibly
get lost. Alright?

50:28.120 --> 50:31.431
Just follow that trail
down the way we came up

50:31.440 --> 50:34.797
and you'll come to the
meadow and the pond

50:35.040 --> 50:37.077
and you point yourself
toward that big pine

50:37.240 --> 50:38.071
with the forked crown.
You remember?

50:38.240 --> 50:39.151
- Hey!
- Yeah.

50:39.320 --> 50:40.310
- You remember?
- Yeah.

50:40.480 --> 50:43.154
Alright. That way
you'll find our creek.

50:43.160 --> 50:46.358
Now, you may not, you may
not see it at first

50:46.360 --> 50:48.079
but you make yourself
quiet and you'll hear it

50:48.240 --> 50:49.469
okay?

50:49.640 --> 50:51.359
You listen
for running water.

50:51.520 --> 50:53.830
<i>And once you find that,
you follow it down</i>

50:54.000 --> 50:56.117
<i>you'll pass
the sheepman's hut.</i>

50:56.320 --> 50:57.959
You'll come
to the Land Rover.

50:59.600 --> 51:02.911
Dad, I've never
driven a car.

51:02.920 --> 51:06.470
You haven't? No.
That's okay. That's okay.

51:06.720 --> 51:07.836
<i>Alright, it's simple.</i>

51:08.040 --> 51:09.156
<i>The clutch is
the only hard part.</i>

51:09.320 --> 51:10.276
<i>You just
have to learn...</i>

51:10.440 --> 51:11.430
<i>Dad, dad, dad. I..</i>

51:11.440 --> 51:12.954
I can't.

51:40.600 --> 51:41.954
Just up over that hump

51:42.160 --> 51:43.037
and it's all
downhill, alright?

51:43.240 --> 51:44.310
Come on.

51:54.240 --> 51:55.230
- Ah!
- Come on.

51:55.400 --> 51:56.629
Dad, come on. Dad.

52:14.920 --> 52:17.071
Hand me your rifle.

52:17.240 --> 52:18.640
The lucky one.

52:30.320 --> 52:33.597
Click. The safety.
Remember?

52:38.120 --> 52:40.271
- Click.
- Alright.

52:41.960 --> 52:43.155
I should have made sure.

52:44.720 --> 52:46.871
You must always
make sure.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.110
Come on.

53:00.680 --> 53:02.672
Damn. This crutch
is useless.

53:02.840 --> 53:04.069
Useless!

53:06.280 --> 53:08.078
You'll have to drag me.

53:08.080 --> 53:11.471
Okay, we can, we can make
some kind of sled.

53:11.640 --> 53:12.994
A sled?

53:13.000 --> 53:14.639
Yes, a sled,
a goddamn sled, David.

53:14.640 --> 53:16.597
Okay, well, just, just
tell me what to do

53:16.600 --> 53:18.034
and I'll do it.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.680
I'm pretty good
at making things.

53:19.715 --> 53:22.957
No, no, no.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.315
Ah, it'd take too long.

53:25.560 --> 53:28.155
We have no rope,
no runners.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.276
What we could cobble
together

53:29.440 --> 53:31.113
won't skid for shit.

53:31.280 --> 53:32.396
We'll lose
too much time.

53:40.520 --> 53:41.590
I can carry you.

53:44.920 --> 53:45.831
It's the one thing
I'm good at

53:46.000 --> 53:47.673
when they
make us work out.

53:47.840 --> 53:49.354
Dead lift.

53:49.520 --> 53:50.715
Dead lift?

53:53.920 --> 53:55.070
That's pretty funny.

53:57.360 --> 54:00.080
<i>- I can do it.
- Alright.</i>

54:00.320 --> 54:02.880
Gravity's on our side.
Yeah.

54:04.640 --> 54:06.871
I never would have
thought of it

54:07.080 --> 54:08.673
but your dead lift
may just save you.

54:11.840 --> 54:14.071
Save us, dad.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.190
Yeah.

54:27.400 --> 54:28.959
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

54:29.160 --> 54:32.232
Okay. Three, two, one.

54:34.720 --> 54:36.677
Ah, God! Okay.

54:36.840 --> 54:38.354
- Ooh.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

54:42.360 --> 54:44.192
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.400
Whoa!

55:15.920 --> 55:17.400
We'll stop for a while
and let you rest.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.480
Alright, you can
set me down here.

55:23.360 --> 55:25.158
You can set me down,
David.

55:29.280 --> 55:32.717
I get it. No resting.
No talking.

55:38.560 --> 55:41.120
You're not gonna
get your first kill.

55:41.280 --> 55:43.715
Not this time around.

55:43.880 --> 55:46.270
That's okay. Next year.

55:48.160 --> 55:50.311
Just tell me
about yours.

55:50.520 --> 55:51.317
Mine?

55:53.560 --> 55:56.120
<i>Your first kill.
Your moose.</i>

55:56.280 --> 55:57.270
<i>Yeah.</i>

55:59.400 --> 56:02.074
<i>Sir Moose. Where was I?</i>

56:02.240 --> 56:03.993
<i>Stuck in the muck.</i>

56:09.000 --> 56:11.196
<i>I was sure that moose
would be gone</i>

56:11.360 --> 56:15.036
<i>but there it was,
bigger than life.</i>

56:32.520 --> 56:33.874
<i>The damn thing honked
like 11 elephants</i>

56:34.040 --> 56:36.077
<i>in a circus-train fire.</i>

56:36.240 --> 56:37.720
<i>I thought
it was charging at me</i>

56:37.880 --> 56:40.156
<i>but it was heading
for the riwer.</i>

56:42.480 --> 56:44.437
I was as alive
as I've ever been.

56:54.960 --> 56:55.950
- You okay?
- Yeah.

56:56.120 --> 56:56.951
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

56:57.200 --> 56:58.190
I'm alright.

57:10.920 --> 57:13.958
Oh, that's not good.
Not good at all.

57:17.520 --> 57:18.954
We'll rest now.

57:21.720 --> 57:23.074
- I'm not tired, dad.
- We'll rest.

57:23.240 --> 57:25.072
- I can keep going.
- We'll rest.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.000
I'm tired.

57:29.960 --> 57:31.314
Yeah.

57:31.480 --> 57:33.039
To get off
this mountain..

57:34.880 --> 57:36.439
...we're gonna
have to feed you.

57:38.200 --> 57:39.350
It should cut easy.

57:41.400 --> 57:43.551
We're not gutting him.

57:43.800 --> 57:45.314
We just want
his belly meat.

57:47.480 --> 57:49.790
Alright. Alright.

57:52.480 --> 57:53.914
Give me that knife.

58:01.160 --> 58:02.560
There.

58:03.800 --> 58:05.120
Eat it.

58:06.160 --> 58:08.038
The fat too.

58:08.200 --> 58:10.999
Especially the fat.

58:11.160 --> 58:13.436
Now we'll cook the rest
further on.

58:15.920 --> 58:17.274
I don't wanna build
a fire here

58:17.440 --> 58:18.556
and taunt mama griz.

58:24.480 --> 58:26.870
There you go. Good.

58:26.880 --> 58:28.200
Baby-bear sushi.

58:33.360 --> 58:34.680
It's getting cold.

58:36.360 --> 58:38.591
Bitch cold. Come on.

58:38.760 --> 58:41.832
Let's go before
your sweat freezes.

58:54.880 --> 58:57.759
- Are we at the hut?
- No.

58:57.920 --> 58:59.639
We're not even
at the meadow.

59:02.400 --> 59:04.710
You're shivering, dad.

59:04.880 --> 59:07.475
We need to build a fire.

59:07.640 --> 59:09.120
- A fire.
- Yeah.

59:09.280 --> 59:10.839
- Before dark.
- Yeah.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.395
Dad.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.910
Dad.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.278
The, uh, the sky's
clearing up.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.395
Why?

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.431
Yeah.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.760
Yeah, it's clearing up.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.030
Here you go.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.110
Thanks.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.433
Good as any brisket
in Texas?

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.589
It's better.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.554
Hm..

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.276
Dad?

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.237
Click.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.470
Click.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.795
Click.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.149
Click.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.276
Dad?

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.679
Dad? Dad, dad,
what's happening?

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.757
Are you choking? Dad?
Dad, what's wrong?

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.799
- You're scaring me, dad.
- I'm cold. I'm so cold.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.914
Okay. You're okay, dad.
You're okay.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.514
You're okay.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.439
You can't die on me, dad.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.080
You can't die
on me, dad.

01:04:57.115 --> 01:05:00.357
You can't die on me.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.430
You can't.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.990
<i>You can't.</i>

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.231
You can't die on me.
You can't.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.197
You can't die on me.
You can't.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.795
<i>Meadow.</i>

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.195
<i>Pond.</i>

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.040
<i>Snag.</i>

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.956
<i>Trail.</i>

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.076
<i>Hut.</i>

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:36.911
<i>Creek.</i>

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.718
<i>Land Rower.</i>

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.710
Meadow. Pond.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.190
Snag.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:50.791
Trail.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.275
Hut.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.794
Creek.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.190
Land Rover.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.397
Road. Cabin.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.718
Meadow. The meadow.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.313
But where
is the beaver pond?

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.109
Where's the beaver pond?

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.712
The pond, dad.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.275
Do you see it?

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.876
Yes. A bull pine.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.839
The snag, dad, the snag.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.076
I can't tell
if it's the right one.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.152
I don't know
where the pond is.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.755
I... I don't know
which way down is.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.513
I don't know
where the canyon ends.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.192
There.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.920
That way. Are you sure?

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.396
Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.919
Okay. Okay.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.595
Okay, just talk to me,
dad.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.711
Just tell me
what I need to do.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.119
You're doing
what needs doing.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.230
Finish your story, dad.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.677
Oh. You need
to know this.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.115
You need to know.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.200
<i>Sir Moose,
he knew he'd be safe</i>

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.117
<i>if he could
cross the river..</i>

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.194
<i>...but the current
was heavy.</i>

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.999
<i>He was swept within
20 yards of my father.</i>

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.351
<i>My father said he newer
saw more personality</i>

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.273
<i>come into the face
of a wild animal.</i>

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.319
<i>He said that he and
the mountain were one.</i>

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.552
Hey!

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.153
<i>I wasn't gonna
let him get away.</i>

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:22.515
I got him! I got him!

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.591
- What are you doing?
- I got him! I got him!

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.832
What do you think you're
doing? What are you doing?

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.077
Why didn't
you shoot him?

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.152
You had him
dead to rights.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.037
That's because
he looked me in the eye.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.429
He knew I could kill him,
but I couldn't take him.

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:48.993
The river
was gonna take him.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.153
<i>What you did..</i>

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.639
...that isn't hunting,
Cal.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.120
That's killing.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.960
<i>That was the last day
my father and I</i>

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.156
<i>hunted together.</i>

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:41.879
<i>I should have
known better.</i>

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.712
<i>I should have known.</i>

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.115
<i>I should have known.</i>

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.870
I never killed
another animal

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.269
I didn't need for meat.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.998
I'm sorry, David.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.471
Shh. Dad.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.074
We never should have
gone back for that elk.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.397
We'll get to the tree
and the creek.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.993
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.912
Then we can talk
some more, okay?

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.274
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.117
Yes.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.554
The bull pine.
Is that it, dad?

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.479
Is that gonna lead us
to the creek?

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.756
Just talk to me, dad.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.752
I can't find it.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.480
I've crossed
the goddamn meadow

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.199
I found the goddamn tree

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.111
I can't find the creek,
dad.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.753
It's okay, dad.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.031
We'll just, we'll just
keep going, right?

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.352
I get it. We'll just..

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.920
We'll just keep going.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.310
Running water.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.239
Okay, walk one..

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.960
...wait five.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.393
Quiet yourself.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.320
Just breathe.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.040
Aah! Aah!

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.110
Okay.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.955
No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.191
Oh, okay.
Come on, David.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.160
Come on.

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.440
Oh, shit.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.794
You can't possibly
get lost.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.480
Landmarks.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.070
Landmarks.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.872
Go to high ground
and find 'em.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.872
Alright.
Go to high ground.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:12.832
That's..

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:16.795
That's the wrong creek.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.432
This is the wrong creek
going the wrong way.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.677
Ours ran to the right.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:24.591
This one's
going to the left.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:30.439
I know that much.
I don't care.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.795
This will lead us to
the shepherd's hut

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.878
right, dad?

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.280
Or to a river?

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.472
All water
leads to water.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.398
All rivers lead to men.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.833
Yeah. We'll follow
the creek then.

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.753
At least it knows
where it's going.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.712
Hey, dad. Wake up.
Come on.

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.035
Dad, dad.

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.480
Dad.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.798
Here. Come on.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.235
Here. Come on.
There you go.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.432
Okay, just chew on it.
Okay? Just chew.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.275
Just chew. Chew.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.080
Dad. Dad, come on.
You gotta eat, dad. Okay?

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.560
Come on.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.600
Here.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:44.475
<i>Come on.</i>

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.516
<i>No.</i>

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:24.870
That's good.

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.832
<i>Hey, dad.
Don't... don't you worry.</i>

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.720
<i>We'll make
it ho... home.</i>

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.872
<i>I'll get you home.
I promise you.</i>

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.790
I promise. I promise.

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.760
See that sky there?

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.030
That's, that's
tomorrow's sky. Yes.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.120
Cold tonight

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.875
and, and clear tomorrow.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.273
It's gonna be,
it's gonna be..

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.117
It's gonna be
bitch cold tonight.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.079
It's, it's gonna be
bitch cold.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.471
Just, just, just..

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.080
<i>Here.</i>

01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.594
This is yours.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.069
All of it.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:14.950
It only forever
belongs to you.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.075
Hope you're hungry.
We're cooking elk steaks.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.075
Our elk.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.715
How's your hand?

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.431
<i>Hm.</i>

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.400
Uh, son..

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.430
Love.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.998
<i>It's so cold.</i>

01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.000
It's so cold.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.190
<i>Burning daylight.</i>

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.991
I'm burning daylight.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.074
Yes. Best get a move on.

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:25.717
I said I'd get a grouse
and I did.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.109
I'm damn sure I did.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.040
We had a, uh,
a Land Rover..

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.879
...parked
somewhere, but..

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.514
...I can't find it.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.916
This is my father.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.389
Oh! I've got you.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.191
<i>We need a doctor.
A man's been shot.</i>

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.875
<i>Yes, it's bad.</i>

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.275
<i>That's right.
Very end of River Road.</i>

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.960
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.037
Hey.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.909
Here. Drink this.

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.309
<i>Slowly.</i>

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.871
<i>- He what?
- Carried him out.</i>

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.189
<i>"Carried him out?"</i>

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.956
- On his back. I saw it.
- How could he?

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.713
I don't know,
I suppose he couldn't..

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:04.995
...but he did.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.793
<i>I'm sorry, son.</i>

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.759
<i>I'm gonna hawe
to take a look at you.</i>

01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.480
What's your name, son?

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.029
David.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.910
<i>David, I'm sorry.</i>

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.880
<i>Your father is dead.</i>

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:16.519
<i>He's been dead
for some time.</i>

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.353
<i>Probably since
early this morning.</i>

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.870
I know.

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.030
I know that.
