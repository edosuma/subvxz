00:40.815 --> 00:43.230
A startling verdict
in what many are calling

00:43.232 --> 00:46.273
the most controversial
murder trial in years.

00:46.275 --> 00:49.525
Anthony Tucker found guilty
of first degree murder.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.023
My client maintains
his innocence.

01:00.025 --> 01:01.563
We have no comment at this time.

01:01.565 --> 01:02.565
[Reporter] How could you
do that to your wife?

01:13.357 --> 01:15.980
Anthony Tucker, I am
honored to formally invite you

01:15.982 --> 01:18.480
to participate as a
contestant on this year's

01:18.482 --> 01:20.313
Jurassic Games.

01:20.315 --> 01:21.482
Do you accept?

01:26.315 --> 01:27.150
Yes.

01:34.857 --> 01:37.355
In entertainment news,
this year's contestants

01:37.357 --> 01:39.480
for the Jurassic Games
have been chosen.

01:39.482 --> 01:41.023
I don't even care
about the contestants,

01:41.025 --> 01:43.771
I wanna see the hot host and
what he's gonna be wearing

01:43.773 --> 01:46.313
and saying, that's
what I wanna watch.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.648
Ooh, I can't wait!

01:47.650 --> 01:48.480
[laughs]

01:48.482 --> 01:50.815
[computer sounds]

01:52.525 --> 01:54.525
[buzzing]

02:19.482 --> 02:21.732
[groaning]

02:24.025 --> 02:25.480
[sighs]

02:25.482 --> 02:27.980
It feels real, doesn't it?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.815
The sand on your skin.

02:31.025 --> 02:34.648
The sun on your face,
the taste in your mouth.

02:34.650 --> 02:38.023
Well to all of you this
world is absolutely real.

02:38.025 --> 02:41.688
The danger is real
and the pain is real.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.400
But so is the reward.

02:44.315 --> 02:46.398
Oh, oh, be careful with that.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.150
I'll need you to do
as I say or boom.

02:50.732 --> 02:53.063
[laughs]

02:53.065 --> 02:57.063
You all know that
when you die in here,

02:57.065 --> 02:58.482
you die for real.

02:59.732 --> 03:02.273
All of you are in
here for one reason.

03:02.275 --> 03:03.940
To win your freedom.

03:04.857 --> 03:05.775
To go home.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.355
You can avoid the death you
justly deserve by surviving,

03:10.357 --> 03:12.438
by fighting, by
confronting your fears

03:12.440 --> 03:14.775
and proving your worthiness.

03:15.940 --> 03:19.605
Your goal is to be
the sole survivor.

03:19.607 --> 03:21.730
Find yourself the last
man or woman standing

03:21.732 --> 03:23.938
and you will win a full
pardon, you will go home,

03:23.940 --> 03:26.940
free, alive, exonerated.

03:28.650 --> 03:31.105
Now it will be tempting
to kill each other,

03:31.107 --> 03:32.398
there's no rules against that,

03:32.400 --> 03:34.605
but please if you
would be so kind,

03:34.607 --> 03:36.605
try to leave at least
some of you alive

03:36.607 --> 03:38.188
for the main attraction.

03:38.190 --> 03:39.273
[booming]

03:39.275 --> 03:41.107
Oh, did you feel that?

03:42.732 --> 03:44.023
A few miles beyond the tree-line

03:44.025 --> 03:46.105
your first objective awaits.

03:46.107 --> 03:48.813
A temporary safe zone.

03:48.815 --> 03:51.231
Now your collars will
alert you when you arrive.

03:51.233 --> 03:53.647
Red, you're too far
away, yellow means

03:53.649 --> 03:56.147
you're getting closer, and
green means you have reached

03:56.149 --> 04:00.150
the safe zone and completed
your first challenge.

04:01.483 --> 04:04.813
Reach the safe zone in
one hour or you die.

04:04.815 --> 04:06.563
Die here in the
game and as you know

04:06.565 --> 04:08.731
you will die in real
life by lethal injection

04:08.733 --> 04:11.898
as been assigned by the state.

04:11.900 --> 04:15.606
The pain you feel in this
world will be real pain.

04:15.608 --> 04:17.188
Like the real pain you inflicted

04:17.190 --> 04:19.563
on those that you have killed.

04:19.565 --> 04:21.188
Everyone understand?

04:21.190 --> 04:22.606
Good.

04:22.608 --> 04:25.481
Congratulations to you all.

04:25.483 --> 04:28.688
As of right now, you are no
longer death row inmates.

04:28.690 --> 04:33.148
You are contestants on the
greatest game show in the world,

04:33.150 --> 04:35.023
the Jurassic Games!

04:35.025 --> 04:37.983
[roaring]

04:41.483 --> 04:43.733
[shouting]

04:52.275 --> 04:54.608
[screaming]

05:02.858 --> 05:04.063
Oh shit.

05:04.065 --> 05:05.731
Did I mess up my hair?

05:05.733 --> 05:06.731
No, it's good?

05:06.733 --> 05:07.563
Okay.

05:07.565 --> 05:08.398
[clapping]

05:08.400 --> 05:09.273
Alright guys, you ready?

05:09.275 --> 05:10.106
How long until we're live?

05:10.108 --> 05:11.023
[Woman] Live in 10.

05:11.025 --> 05:12.525
[The Host] Okay.

05:16.608 --> 05:20.188
[Woman] Alright everyone,
we're going live in three, two...

05:20.190 --> 05:21.563
[clears throat]

05:21.565 --> 05:24.523
They have less than 59
minutes to reach the safe zone.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.523
So sit back, try to relax and
enjoy, ladies and gentlemen.

05:27.525 --> 05:30.231
Because today is going
to be a hell of a day

05:30.233 --> 05:33.106
for our brave contestants.

05:33.108 --> 05:35.566
[flatlining]

05:48.233 --> 05:49.688
So far so good.

05:49.690 --> 05:53.356
I mean that lineup
is gorgeous on camera.

05:53.358 --> 05:54.731
I'm telling you right
now we are hitting

05:54.733 --> 05:56.438
all the key demographics.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.898
It's a great cast.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.650
It's the best one yet.

06:01.315 --> 06:03.106
Stay on the cannibal.

06:03.108 --> 06:04.400
[kids laughing]

06:18.815 --> 06:21.107
[shouting]

06:24.190 --> 06:25.688
Stay outta my way,
you piece of shit!

06:25.690 --> 06:26.688
I'm sorry!

06:26.690 --> 06:29.150
Please don't hurt me, please!

06:31.983 --> 06:34.233
[shouting]

06:45.108 --> 06:46.150
This is real!

06:47.025 --> 06:49.148
I can taste you!

06:49.150 --> 06:51.190
[laughs]

06:53.565 --> 06:55.188
Our contestants
are frantically

06:55.190 --> 06:57.063
trying to find the safe zone.

06:57.065 --> 06:58.981
Don't worry, I'm sure
most of them will.

06:58.983 --> 07:03.023
But in the end, nine will
die and one will win.

07:03.025 --> 07:07.063
And this year's four stages
are by far the best ever.

07:07.065 --> 07:08.563
Stage one.

07:08.565 --> 07:10.938
The contestants must survive
being hunted by hungry dinosaurs

07:10.940 --> 07:14.023
long enough to find the
temporary safe zone.

07:14.025 --> 07:15.606
Stage two.

07:15.608 --> 07:17.063
The maze.

07:17.065 --> 07:19.648
A deadly labyrinth filled with
some of our fan favorites.

07:19.650 --> 07:22.856
That's right, the raptors
are back this year.

07:22.858 --> 07:25.731
Stage three, the minefield.

07:25.733 --> 07:27.563
Tread lightly and you
might walk out of this game

07:27.565 --> 07:29.938
with all your limbs.

07:29.940 --> 07:32.440
And our final stage this year?

07:34.315 --> 07:38.106
You don't actually think I'm
gonna give that away, do you?

07:38.108 --> 07:41.231
Let's just say you
won't be disappointed.

07:41.233 --> 07:42.648
So stay tuned, fans!

07:42.650 --> 07:46.233
Because the Jurassic
Games start right now!

07:49.315 --> 07:51.106
[Announcer] In the
ultimate reality game show,

07:51.108 --> 07:52.188
[dramatic music]

07:52.190 --> 07:54.938
10 death row inmates must
survive a virtual world

07:54.940 --> 07:59.356
filled with the deadliest
predators to ever roam the earth.

07:59.358 --> 08:04.313
William Davis, guilty on 23
counts of drug-related homicide.

08:04.315 --> 08:06.814
Ren Saizo, contract killer.

08:06.816 --> 08:10.064
Guilty of the murder of
a United States senator.

08:10.066 --> 08:11.939
Victor Gonzalez, The Wasp.

08:11.941 --> 08:13.397
Leader of the Hive drug cartel.

08:13.399 --> 08:15.730
Guilty of 35 counts of murder.

08:15.732 --> 08:16.730
Stephanie Rogers...

08:16.732 --> 08:17.897
Brian, status report.

08:17.899 --> 08:20.023
Games on alpha online,
raptor AI online,

08:20.025 --> 08:22.939
prepping game zone beta,
prepping to disengage rex one.

08:22.941 --> 08:24.314
Security holding up?

08:24.316 --> 08:25.480
Airtight.

08:25.482 --> 08:26.480
46 attempts to
breach our firewall

08:26.482 --> 08:28.189
but so far none successful.

08:28.191 --> 08:29.398
And none will be.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.148
Stay vigilant.

08:31.150 --> 08:33.688
Back live in the studio in 10.

08:33.691 --> 08:34.525
Okay.

08:37.941 --> 08:40.563
We never know who,
we never know when.

08:40.566 --> 08:44.439
But sadly we had to say
goodbye to Dr. Eli Franklin.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.105
The first contestant
to be eliminated

08:46.107 --> 08:49.105
in this year's Jurassic Games.

08:49.107 --> 08:51.315
[shouting]

08:56.941 --> 08:59.939
Of course, we can't
feel too sorry for him.

08:59.941 --> 09:02.480
That guy liked to
blow people up.

09:02.482 --> 09:04.315
A lot.

09:06.941 --> 09:09.191
[laughing]

09:11.275 --> 09:14.689
[Girl] What's going
on with Dr. Franklin?

09:14.691 --> 09:15.816
Dr. Franklin?

09:16.775 --> 09:17.607
You okay?

09:20.107 --> 09:22.355
God, he's so weird.

09:22.357 --> 09:25.482
Hey wait, doc,
you forgot your bag!

09:26.525 --> 09:28.980
[explodes]

09:28.982 --> 09:30.980
I don't know about
you, but honestly

09:30.982 --> 09:33.648
he wasn't one of my
favorites anyway.

09:33.650 --> 09:36.066
Only nine contestants remain.

09:47.025 --> 09:49.316
[groaning]

10:08.357 --> 10:10.525
[roaring]

10:18.066 --> 10:21.064
Do you know where
the safe zone is?

10:21.066 --> 10:21.900
I'm lost.

10:27.357 --> 10:29.607
[shouting]

10:30.607 --> 10:33.400
[dramatic music]

10:39.400 --> 10:41.607
[punching]

11:06.775 --> 11:08.566
You're next, bitch!

11:26.900 --> 11:29.730
[laughing]

11:29.732 --> 11:31.773
[shouting]

11:31.775 --> 11:33.941
[hitting]

11:51.900 --> 11:52.732
What?

11:58.816 --> 12:01.650
You're kind of a
pussy, aren't you?

12:06.025 --> 12:08.730
I'm not here to kill anybody.

12:08.732 --> 12:10.814
I'm here to kill everybody.

12:10.816 --> 12:11.983
Well, not you.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.107
Not yet.

12:15.857 --> 12:16.732
Lighten up.

12:20.941 --> 12:25.691
Come on, I think the safe
zone's this way and I'm scared.

12:33.941 --> 12:36.275
[squawking]

12:37.816 --> 12:38.648
[Crowd] No more games!

12:38.650 --> 12:39.689
No more games!

12:39.691 --> 12:40.525
No more...

12:43.191 --> 12:45.691
[tense music]

12:54.150 --> 12:55.900
Live in three, two.

12:56.816 --> 12:58.064
Thank you.

12:58.066 --> 12:59.648
I'm here with Bailey
and Andrew Tucker.

12:59.650 --> 13:02.064
Thank you for taking the
time to meet with me.

13:02.066 --> 13:04.189
Bailey, let's start
with you, sweetheart.

13:04.191 --> 13:05.439
How do you feel
about your father

13:05.441 --> 13:08.898
being a contestant on
the Jurassic Games?

13:08.900 --> 13:12.732
Um, this was his only
chance to get out, so.

13:14.025 --> 13:15.398
That's right.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.898
If he wins, he will be
pardoned of all of his crimes.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.564
He didn't commit any crimes.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.064
And he didn't kill my mom!

13:21.066 --> 13:23.439
Andrew stop, we're not
supposed to talk about it.

13:23.441 --> 13:25.023
It's alright.

13:25.025 --> 13:28.148
Your mother's death was tragic.

13:28.150 --> 13:30.439
I'm very sorry she can't
be with you here today.

13:30.441 --> 13:32.105
Thank you.

13:32.107 --> 13:34.439
Is there anything you'd
like to say to your father?

13:34.441 --> 13:35.480
Look into this camera.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.732
You can send him a message.

13:38.982 --> 13:40.940
Survive, Dad, please.

13:42.275 --> 13:43.523
We know you're innocent.

13:43.525 --> 13:44.605
Get him out of the games!

13:44.607 --> 13:46.440
- Stop the games!
- Andy.

13:47.441 --> 13:48.439
[Crowd] No more games!

13:48.441 --> 13:49.605
No more games!

13:49.607 --> 13:50.814
No more games!

13:50.816 --> 13:52.230
No more games!

13:52.232 --> 13:53.689
No more games!

13:53.691 --> 13:55.148
No more games!

13:55.150 --> 13:56.564
No more games!

13:56.566 --> 13:58.023
No more games!

13:58.025 --> 13:59.480
No more games!

13:59.482 --> 14:00.939
I can't believe they
made me talk to his kids.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.773
They think he's innocent.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.023
What difference does it make?

14:05.025 --> 14:07.230
Well, what if
they found proof?

14:07.232 --> 14:08.730
You think they'd let him go?

14:08.732 --> 14:10.605
If they find proof,
we'll never hear about it.

14:10.607 --> 14:11.605
Trust me.

14:11.607 --> 14:12.605
Let's go!

14:12.607 --> 14:13.982
Move, move, move!

14:22.107 --> 14:23.314
So how close are they?

14:23.316 --> 14:24.398
The audience is
getting restless.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.980
A few minutes most,
but they're good hunters.

14:25.982 --> 14:27.230
I thought we could
build tension.

14:27.232 --> 14:28.480
Build tension?

14:28.482 --> 14:30.898
Our viewers don't care
about tension, Brian.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.773
They just wanna see the
contestants die horribly.

14:33.775 --> 14:36.107
Spawn them closer next time.

14:39.607 --> 14:41.314
And stay on Tucker.

14:41.316 --> 14:43.480
The audience already is
sympathetic with him.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.773
Let's watch him die live.

14:45.775 --> 14:46.857
You got it.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.480
So your wife.

15:01.482 --> 15:03.523
She was tortured.

15:03.525 --> 15:05.355
Leave it alone.

15:05.357 --> 15:08.980
I wonder what she was
thinking when she died.

15:08.982 --> 15:11.523
Some people can
just turn it off.

15:11.525 --> 15:12.357
The pain.

15:13.482 --> 15:15.525
I've always admired that.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.939
I read your cast bio.

15:19.941 --> 15:21.858
Loving daddy, good man.

15:23.066 --> 15:26.648
It's clear why the world
thinks you're innocent.

15:26.650 --> 15:30.566
If it makes you feel any
better, I believe you.

15:31.816 --> 15:32.650
Goodie.

15:33.525 --> 15:35.691
[kicking]

15:40.441 --> 15:41.814
Get up!

15:41.816 --> 15:44.066
[coughing]

16:11.900 --> 16:14.275
[struggling]

16:27.107 --> 16:29.690
I'll see you in the next round.

16:37.441 --> 16:38.523
[laughing]

16:38.525 --> 16:40.647
Go you little bitch.

16:40.649 --> 16:41.938
Hey, you know what?

16:41.940 --> 16:43.563
Can we get some wind,
just to make him sway

16:43.565 --> 16:45.438
a little bit?

16:45.440 --> 16:47.065
Roll her package.

16:49.024 --> 16:50.272
Bloodthirsty.

16:50.274 --> 16:51.647
Merciless.

16:51.649 --> 16:53.147
Psychopath.

16:53.149 --> 16:56.647
Words used to describe
Sarah Laforte.

16:56.649 --> 16:57.981
The youngest death row inmate

16:57.983 --> 17:00.231
to ever enter the
Jurassic Games.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.356
I had the opportunity
to sit down with her

17:02.358 --> 17:07.275
and try to get inside the head
of this cold-blooded killer.

17:15.940 --> 17:16.775
Sarah?

17:19.440 --> 17:22.690
I just want to ask
you a few questions.

17:32.065 --> 17:32.900
Joy.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.858
My friends call me Joy.

17:38.025 --> 17:40.688
Why do you prefer
to be called Joy?

17:40.690 --> 17:43.525
Because I'm such
a happy person.

17:44.525 --> 17:45.400
Okay Joy.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.688
What happened in your
life that brought you here

17:49.690 --> 17:51.357
at such a young age?

17:53.108 --> 17:54.441
It's a secret.

18:00.858 --> 18:03.108
[clanking]

18:08.065 --> 18:10.065
[sighs]

18:12.315 --> 18:13.900
Any more questions?

18:15.690 --> 18:17.857
[beeping]

18:21.065 --> 18:22.815
Ah, well well well.

18:24.315 --> 18:27.398
You are still hanging
in there, aren't ya?

18:27.400 --> 18:29.400
Oh come on man, come on!

18:30.900 --> 18:32.731
What do you got inside ya, huh?

18:32.733 --> 18:33.898
Are you gonna let
this little girl

18:33.900 --> 18:35.648
take you out of the
game this early?

18:35.650 --> 18:37.231
What about your kids?

18:37.233 --> 18:38.688
You can't die now.

18:38.690 --> 18:39.525
Jesus.

19:04.733 --> 19:08.400
[speaking foreign language]

19:10.275 --> 19:13.608
We must work together
as long as we can.

19:18.733 --> 19:23.148
There are things more
terrible than us in this game.

19:23.150 --> 19:27.150
As individuals, we
don't stand a chance!

19:29.275 --> 19:31.813
There may still
be a way to escape

19:31.815 --> 19:33.482
if we work together.

19:34.565 --> 19:36.273
We must get to the safe zone.

19:36.275 --> 19:37.940
We are being hunted.

19:43.525 --> 19:44.856
There are three of them.

19:44.858 --> 19:46.191
We must go, now!

19:54.983 --> 19:58.650
[speaking foreign language]

20:08.440 --> 20:11.190
[dramatic music]

20:18.358 --> 20:20.981
[Savannah] You're not
planning on using that, are you?

20:20.983 --> 20:22.231
No.

20:22.233 --> 20:24.691
We wouldn't want an uprising.

20:26.940 --> 20:29.023
It almost sounds like you do.

20:29.025 --> 20:30.731
His children, Savannah?

20:30.733 --> 20:33.023
You made me interview
Tucker's children?

20:33.025 --> 20:34.273
Well he's trending high.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.813
People want him to win.

20:35.815 --> 20:37.898
It's been a while since we had
one that might be innocent.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.856
His children
believe that he is,

20:39.858 --> 20:40.856
and they're about to see him

20:40.858 --> 20:43.688
get ripped to shreds on live TV.

20:43.690 --> 20:46.231
Nobody's forcing
you to be here.

20:46.233 --> 20:49.148
There are a number of
people behind you that would

20:49.150 --> 20:50.813
love your job.

20:50.815 --> 20:53.815
Younger, smarter, prettier.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.398
They would put their
first born in the game

20:56.400 --> 20:57.563
to get a shot at your position.

20:57.565 --> 20:58.400
I know.

20:59.275 --> 21:00.731
I want to be here.

21:00.733 --> 21:01.566
Good.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.856
Oh.

21:06.858 --> 21:09.563
If you ever question
an assignment again,

21:09.565 --> 21:13.025
you can go ahead and
clean out your desk.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.565
[shouts]

21:21.150 --> 21:23.400
[groaning]

21:44.775 --> 21:47.023
Oh he should be easy.

21:47.025 --> 21:48.481
You want him?

21:48.483 --> 21:49.316
Wait.

21:52.608 --> 21:53.900
Don't be stupid.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.233
Hi friend.

21:57.775 --> 22:01.313
Do you happen to know which
way it is to the safe zone?

22:01.315 --> 22:04.563
We don't have much
time to find it.

22:04.565 --> 22:06.650
No, I have no idea.

22:07.983 --> 22:09.108
We're lost.

22:10.233 --> 22:13.563
We could die on the
first challenge.

22:13.565 --> 22:15.606
Wrong answer, pal!

22:15.608 --> 22:16.650
Wait, stop!

22:19.315 --> 22:21.188
The raptors have
entered the canyon area.

22:21.190 --> 22:22.188
What?

22:22.190 --> 22:23.188
No, no no no.

22:23.190 --> 22:25.023
How long until they get to them?

22:25.025 --> 22:26.483
Any second now.

22:27.483 --> 22:30.188
Do you know who I am?

22:30.190 --> 22:34.275
I am El Avispa, The Wasp!

22:36.608 --> 22:38.858
[laughing]

22:40.108 --> 22:41.856
You know who I am?

22:41.858 --> 22:43.273
I'm The Wasp!

22:43.275 --> 22:44.856
I got a big stinger on my butt

22:44.858 --> 22:48.606
and when I sting
you I'm gonna die.

22:48.608 --> 22:49.688
I think that's a bee, man.

22:49.690 --> 22:50.525
Shut up!

22:53.525 --> 22:55.398
I have very powerful friends.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.063
Friends who can help us.

22:58.065 --> 22:59.188
Help me.

22:59.190 --> 23:02.107
Help me get to the
end, help me win.

23:03.108 --> 23:05.563
Why would we do that?

23:05.565 --> 23:08.356
Because I can
save your mother.

23:08.358 --> 23:10.563
What do you know
about my mama, huh?

23:10.565 --> 23:12.773
I know all about you.

23:12.775 --> 23:13.608
Trust me.

23:14.608 --> 23:16.688
I can get us all out of here.

23:16.690 --> 23:19.688
You will be able to
see your mother again.

23:19.690 --> 23:20.900
Alive and well.

23:22.358 --> 23:23.438
You sack of shit!

23:23.440 --> 23:26.023
[dramatic music]

23:26.025 --> 23:28.233
Wait wait wait wait wait!

23:29.358 --> 23:31.525
[hissing]

23:36.900 --> 23:37.733
Well?

23:39.150 --> 23:41.233
What are you waiting for?

23:43.690 --> 23:45.065
Wait wait wait.

23:45.940 --> 23:46.775
Not yet.

23:48.233 --> 23:49.066
Come on!

23:56.565 --> 23:59.273
[laughing]

23:59.275 --> 24:00.606
[exclaiming]

24:00.608 --> 24:01.525
What the?

24:03.190 --> 24:04.398
What is happening in here?

24:04.400 --> 24:06.023
Our ratings have dipped 4%.

24:06.025 --> 24:07.563
Why did you stop the raptors?

24:07.565 --> 24:09.773
Listen, it's called
foreplay, Savannah.

24:09.775 --> 24:11.731
You might wanna try it sometime.

24:11.733 --> 24:16.275
[Woman] Alright we're back
in five, four, three, two.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.438
That just happened.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.481
Could this be an unholy alliance

24:22.483 --> 24:25.523
between the Mason
brothers and The Wasp?

24:25.525 --> 24:26.731
[sighs]

24:26.733 --> 24:29.063
That would be a
match made in hell.

24:29.065 --> 24:31.313
And ladies and gentlemen,
I would hate to see

24:31.315 --> 24:35.148
what that means for
our other contestants.

24:35.150 --> 24:38.231
Let's head back to the canyon.

24:38.233 --> 24:39.481
[laughing]

24:39.483 --> 24:41.938
What just happened?

24:41.940 --> 24:42.857
Let's go.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.066
Wait!

24:47.315 --> 24:48.150
Join me.

24:49.315 --> 24:50.563
Help me get to the end.

24:50.565 --> 24:53.523
I can save your
mother, I promise.

24:53.525 --> 24:54.358
Come on.

24:56.108 --> 24:59.813
You really think he's gonna
save anybody else but himself?

24:59.815 --> 25:02.148
How stupid could you be?

25:02.150 --> 25:04.481
She's dying of cancer, no?

25:04.483 --> 25:06.983
No one dies of cancer anymore.

25:08.190 --> 25:10.438
Poor people do,
you piece of shit!

25:10.440 --> 25:13.273
I can pay for the treatment!

25:13.275 --> 25:14.858
Okay, okay, okay!

25:17.190 --> 25:18.565
We'll help you.

25:19.858 --> 25:21.481
Have you lost your mind?

25:21.483 --> 25:24.063
Haven't you seen
this show before?

25:24.065 --> 25:26.438
If he wins, we die, you idiot!

25:26.440 --> 25:30.023
No he said he could
get us out too, huh?

25:30.025 --> 25:32.273
He knows people, right?

25:32.275 --> 25:33.108
Si.

25:34.525 --> 25:37.523
If there's even a chance
that we can save Mom.

25:37.525 --> 25:40.273
This is all bullshit!

25:40.275 --> 25:43.606
If he knows anyone outside,
then what's he doing

25:43.608 --> 25:45.858
in here in the first place?

25:47.025 --> 25:49.148
I want you to use your
tiny little brain.

25:49.150 --> 25:51.358
Think about that, ya moron.

25:52.483 --> 25:53.481
God damnit!

25:53.483 --> 25:54.900
God damnit, what?

25:56.733 --> 26:00.191
You touch him, and
I'll kill you myself.

26:03.315 --> 26:04.400
Okay, fine!

26:06.900 --> 26:07.733
Fine!

26:09.608 --> 26:10.441
For now.

26:11.608 --> 26:12.525
We'll help.

26:23.733 --> 26:25.648
[sighs]

26:25.650 --> 26:28.398
[clears throat]

26:28.400 --> 26:30.688
None of them know.

26:30.690 --> 26:35.023
Unfortunately, their mother,
Rosetta Mason, passed yesterday.

26:35.025 --> 26:35.898
[tense music]

26:35.900 --> 26:38.106
Such tragedy.

26:38.108 --> 26:42.483
But I promise that you are
gonna see the raptors soon

26:43.650 --> 26:45.938
because stage two,
the maze, is up next

26:45.940 --> 26:49.273
right here on the
Jurassic Games.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.563
[Woman] And we're clear.

26:50.565 --> 26:53.481
That was a good
transition, right?

26:53.483 --> 26:54.688
That was good.

26:54.690 --> 26:56.398
Nice work.

26:56.400 --> 27:00.731
I at first felt that the brothers
angle was a little forced

27:00.733 --> 27:03.231
but it was good drama.

27:03.233 --> 27:04.731
Well, alright.

27:04.733 --> 27:06.063
Hey, by the way, we gotta
make sure we keep them alive

27:06.065 --> 27:08.188
as long as possible.

27:08.190 --> 27:11.773
Okay, can you imagine a
Cane and Abel type of ending

27:11.775 --> 27:13.148
for the finale?

27:13.150 --> 27:14.563
I'm sorry to interrupt,
the contestants

27:14.565 --> 27:17.900
are approaching the
safe zone right now.

27:24.065 --> 27:25.063
[laughs]

27:25.065 --> 27:26.063
We are close!

27:26.065 --> 27:26.982
Keep going!

Go ahead.

28:24.983 --> 28:25.858
Taste some.

28:27.400 --> 28:31.148
I don't think they'd let
you die of poison berry.

28:31.150 --> 28:33.233
That's not very exciting.

28:38.233 --> 28:43.106
Seems like everything in here
tastes a little bit better.

28:43.108 --> 28:45.898
I don't know how they do it.

28:45.900 --> 28:46.733
Do you?

28:49.275 --> 28:51.688
How would you taste?

28:51.690 --> 28:53.313

I'm gonna eat you.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.481
Every single network
is covering the games.

30:28.483 --> 30:30.188
This is even bigger
than last year.

30:30.190 --> 30:31.731
Looks like a riot in Midtown.

30:31.733 --> 30:33.023
Eh, nothing new.

30:33.025 --> 30:34.523
They've been
protesting for years.

30:34.525 --> 30:35.648
Yeah.

30:35.650 --> 30:36.856
We should put some of
those Cavemen in the games.

30:36.858 --> 30:38.106
Yeah no shit.

30:38.108 --> 30:39.273
Come on.

30:39.275 --> 30:40.813
We're starting the maze.

30:40.815 --> 30:44.523
[Crowd] No more games, no
more games, no more games!

30:44.525 --> 30:47.525
[suspenseful music]

30:55.983 --> 30:57.938
Only eight remain.

30:57.940 --> 31:00.023
What a cast though, huh?

31:00.025 --> 31:01.608
The Mason brothers.

31:02.815 --> 31:04.938
Would you take out
one of your own

31:04.940 --> 31:07.400
if it really came down to it?

31:08.233 --> 31:09.731
We'll see.

31:09.733 --> 31:10.650
We got Joy.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.440
Ah, Joy, Joy, Joy.

31:14.608 --> 31:16.231
I'm telling you, there
is something special

31:16.233 --> 31:18.813
about sweet little Joy.

31:18.815 --> 31:21.356
Then we got Albert,
the cannibal.

31:21.358 --> 31:24.441
Albert, you make me sick.

31:25.233 --> 31:27.563
In a good way, of course,
because people tune in

31:27.565 --> 31:29.481
just to see you die.

31:29.483 --> 31:31.481
[laughs]

31:31.483 --> 31:32.400
I like you.

31:33.565 --> 31:37.063
Keep you around for our
international viewers.

31:37.065 --> 31:40.563
And then we have
poor Anthony Tucker.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.438
Doesn't really seem like
he's cut out for this,

31:43.440 --> 31:47.313
but you know what, America
loves a tragic hero so I do too.

31:47.315 --> 31:49.606
Hang in there, buddy.

31:49.608 --> 31:50.441
Stephanie.

31:51.690 --> 31:52.775
Oh Stephanie.

31:54.108 --> 31:57.813
I'd really hate for
someone or something

31:57.815 --> 32:00.481
to ruin that pretty face.

32:00.483 --> 32:02.773
Guess we'll have
to wait for that.

32:02.775 --> 32:04.775
And El Avispa, The Wasp.

32:05.940 --> 32:07.188
I like you.

32:07.190 --> 32:08.440
You're naughty.

32:10.065 --> 32:12.940
Alright, wake 'em
up, I wanna play.

32:30.483 --> 32:32.148
Welcome, contestants.

32:32.150 --> 32:34.398
I hope you are ready for
your first challenge.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.773
We like to call it the maze.

32:36.775 --> 32:38.063
A favorite segment of the games

32:38.065 --> 32:40.313
and our longest-running
challenge.

32:40.315 --> 32:41.856
The rules are simple.

32:41.858 --> 32:43.188
Be the first to
escape your chains

32:43.190 --> 32:45.650
and you will be awarded this.

32:49.690 --> 32:50.525
Right?

32:51.483 --> 32:52.981
Use it to protect yourself,

32:52.983 --> 32:54.981
use it to obliterate
your enemies.

32:54.983 --> 32:57.023
The choice is yours.

32:57.025 --> 32:58.938
I think in the right hands,
the hands of a fighter,

32:58.940 --> 33:01.398
the hands of a winner,
this fine piece of hardware

33:01.400 --> 33:03.313
could wind up ending
the game early.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.856
Anything can happen
in the Jurassic Games.

33:05.858 --> 33:08.106
That's what makes
it so much fun!

33:08.108 --> 33:09.313
So here we go!

33:09.315 --> 33:12.231
Ready in three two one go!

33:12.233 --> 33:15.233
[suspenseful music]

33:47.273 --> 33:49.689
[laughing]

33:49.691 --> 33:51.146
I got it!

33:51.148 --> 33:52.481
You're all dead!

33:52.483 --> 33:53.771
I win!

33:53.773 --> 33:54.607
Game over!

33:55.566 --> 33:56.983
Albert, Albert!

33:59.316 --> 34:02.731
You have no honor if you
use that now against us.

34:02.733 --> 34:05.983
Shut up!
[gun fires]

34:07.441 --> 34:09.858
Anybody else, any last words?

34:16.108 --> 34:19.063
Please, please don't
shoot, I was kidding.

34:19.065 --> 34:21.271
- I won't kill anybody.
- Stay still!

34:21.273 --> 34:22.521
Please!

34:22.523 --> 34:23.481
Shoot him, what
are you waiting for?

34:23.483 --> 34:26.106
He's not gonna shoot him.

34:26.108 --> 34:28.606
He's the perfect
person for the gun.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.774
The one that won't use it.

34:31.815 --> 34:33.481
[alarm blares]

34:33.483 --> 34:36.233
[exciting music]

34:37.275 --> 34:39.690
[screeching]

35:04.733 --> 35:05.733
Move away.

35:08.316 --> 35:10.650
[gun fires]

35:40.025 --> 35:40.858
Ren.

35:49.858 --> 35:52.316
[screeching]

36:59.775 --> 37:01.941
[hitting]

37:03.316 --> 37:05.566
[shouting]

38:36.858 --> 38:38.900
[groans]

39:25.150 --> 39:27.483
[gun fires]

39:30.858 --> 39:33.275
[screeching]

39:35.441 --> 39:36.275
Go, go!

39:42.691 --> 39:43.525
Go!

39:46.108 --> 39:48.566
[gun firing]

40:05.691 --> 40:07.398
- There's not an exit.
- What?

40:07.400 --> 40:09.439
There's not a way out,
they're all dead ends.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.689
That way!

40:10.691 --> 40:11.689
Where's Ren?

40:11.691 --> 40:13.356
- Who?
- The grate.

40:13.358 --> 40:14.316
Get back!

40:15.483 --> 40:17.856
[gun fires]

40:17.858 --> 40:19.025
Go, hurry, go!

40:26.316 --> 40:28.733
[gun firing]

40:38.691 --> 40:39.525
Go!

40:40.816 --> 40:42.273
Move!

40:42.275 --> 40:43.108
Move!

40:44.483 --> 40:46.691
[shouting]

41:00.816 --> 41:01.731
Watch out!

41:01.733 --> 41:04.025
[shouting]

41:05.691 --> 41:07.023
[laughing]

41:07.025 --> 41:10.064
We're right back
where we started.

41:10.066 --> 41:11.356
[gun fizzles]

41:11.358 --> 41:13.856
[shouting]

41:13.858 --> 41:15.856
[hits]

41:15.858 --> 41:18.064
Congratulations, contestants.

41:18.066 --> 41:19.356
Well done.

41:19.358 --> 41:20.191
Stephanie.

41:21.358 --> 41:23.648
Because you were the
first to exit the maze

41:23.650 --> 41:26.898
I am gonna reward you with this.

41:26.900 --> 41:29.731
And not far from here
you will find a crate

41:29.733 --> 41:33.064
containing a few potentially
game-changing supplies.

41:33.066 --> 41:35.189
This map will help
you get there safely.

41:35.191 --> 41:36.856
Stephanie, you may
choose to share it

41:36.858 --> 41:38.733
or keep it to yourself.

41:43.566 --> 41:46.358
The clock is
ticking, contestants.

41:47.650 --> 41:49.356
Give it to me!

41:49.358 --> 41:50.566
Hey back off!

41:51.733 --> 41:53.314
I want that.

41:53.316 --> 41:55.441
[punches]

41:58.025 --> 41:59.314
Hey, let her go!

41:59.316 --> 42:01.273
Get off me, boy.

42:01.275 --> 42:03.525
[coughing]

42:05.191 --> 42:06.108
I got it.

42:07.275 --> 42:08.108
Come on.

42:09.108 --> 42:09.941
I got it.

42:11.150 --> 42:12.108
Let's go.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.189
[stabbing]
[shouting]

42:37.191 --> 42:38.356
Like that?

42:38.358 --> 42:39.941
How does that feel?

42:42.358 --> 42:44.273
First thought to
have been a hoax,

42:44.275 --> 42:46.648
Stephanie Rogers
brutally murdered 16 men

42:46.650 --> 42:49.439
and broadcast her kills
live on the internet.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.939
She spent the last three years

42:50.941 --> 42:52.606
at the Starkweather
Federal Penitentiary

42:52.608 --> 42:55.981
prior to her acceptance in
this year's Jurassic Games.

42:55.983 --> 42:59.314
She'll use her charms to
seduce the men in the game,

42:59.316 --> 43:02.481
just like a black widow
luring them into her trap,

43:02.483 --> 43:05.189
killing them in cold blood.

43:05.191 --> 43:06.189
[scoffs]

43:06.191 --> 43:07.358
Gimme a break.

43:09.816 --> 43:10.981
Come with me.

43:10.983 --> 43:14.191
I have to do some
fluff piece interview.

43:16.441 --> 43:18.648
I'm joined now
by Savannah Black.

43:18.650 --> 43:20.689
She is the director of the
controversial sensation

43:20.691 --> 43:23.023
known around the globe
as the Jurassic Games.

43:23.025 --> 43:25.314
Savannah, thank you for
joining us this afternoon.

43:25.316 --> 43:26.898
Oh, my pleasure Jack,
thank you for having me.

43:26.900 --> 43:27.898
Let's begin right off the bat

43:27.900 --> 43:29.689
with the morality issue here.

43:29.691 --> 43:31.481
Uh, excuse me?

43:31.483 --> 43:32.856
Well you know
as well as anybody

43:32.858 --> 43:34.856
the show is
controversial, even still.

43:34.858 --> 43:36.523
Are we still discussing this?

43:36.525 --> 43:39.523
The contestants on our show
are going to die anyway.

43:39.525 --> 43:42.689
Now what we're doing, with
the support of the government,

43:42.691 --> 43:46.481
I might add, is giving
them a chance at freedom.

43:46.483 --> 43:47.939
But some say this is too much.

43:47.941 --> 43:49.606
Isn't this really nothing
more than exploitation

43:49.608 --> 43:53.523
of these contestants
for money, for ratings?

43:53.525 --> 43:57.148
And you are essentially torturing
them on live television.

43:57.150 --> 44:00.731
Well I'm not concerned
with a vocal minority.

44:00.733 --> 44:02.189
A lot more people
love the games.

44:02.191 --> 44:04.523
300 million the
last time I looked.

44:04.525 --> 44:06.148
It's what the people want.

44:06.150 --> 44:07.606
You didn't answer my question.

44:07.608 --> 44:09.564
Well they are still
dying by lethal injection.

44:09.566 --> 44:11.314
- Yes, but...
- Listen.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.106
We didn't invent this.

44:13.108 --> 44:14.606
As much as I'd like
to take credit for it,

44:14.608 --> 44:16.898
public execution is nothing new.

44:16.900 --> 44:19.314
Think back to the days
of the Roman Empire.

44:19.316 --> 44:20.939
The gladiators fought
tigers and there was

44:20.941 --> 44:23.856
a Coliseum filled with people
wanting the tiger to win

44:23.858 --> 44:26.148
and most often it did.

44:26.150 --> 44:28.273
Now at least on our show
one of our contestants

44:28.275 --> 44:29.731
is guaranteed to live.

44:29.733 --> 44:30.981
What about Anthony Tucker?

44:30.983 --> 44:32.564
There are a lot of folks
out there who believe

44:32.566 --> 44:34.564
he was wrongly convicted
of killing his wife.

44:34.566 --> 44:35.898
Well he was convicted
in a court of law

44:35.900 --> 44:37.523
and sentenced to death.

44:37.525 --> 44:39.481
And that is the only
qualification required

44:39.483 --> 44:41.023
to enter the games.

44:41.025 --> 44:43.398
Oh, that and they
look good on camera.

44:43.400 --> 44:45.314
But wouldn't you agree
having an innocent contestant

44:45.316 --> 44:47.148
killed on your show does
nothing more than fuel the fire

44:47.150 --> 44:48.939
for groups like The Cavemen?

44:48.941 --> 44:50.273
I'm not familiar with them.

44:50.275 --> 44:51.481
You're trying to tell
me you've never heard

44:51.483 --> 44:52.981
of The Cavemen?

44:52.983 --> 44:56.439
I am aware of a very few
and extremely disorganized...

44:56.441 --> 44:59.106
Come on, it's well-known
they have promised

44:59.108 --> 45:01.606
to disrupt the ending
of this year's games.

45:01.608 --> 45:02.981
Surely you're aware.

45:02.983 --> 45:04.689
Well groups like
that have tried before.

45:04.691 --> 45:06.731
But our security is
tight, and I am confident

45:06.733 --> 45:09.314
that the games will go
on as they always do.

45:09.316 --> 45:10.898
Now we are approaching
our next challenge

45:10.900 --> 45:13.106
and your audience
won't wanna miss that.

45:13.108 --> 45:16.023
Savannah Black, thank
you for joining us.

45:16.025 --> 45:17.898
Oh, thank you Jack.

45:17.900 --> 45:19.733
Asshole!

45:19.858 --> 45:22.064
Volunteering for the games
is an admission of guilt!

45:22.066 --> 45:23.731
These aren't people,
they're murderers.

45:23.733 --> 45:26.023
God, I've had it up to
here with The Cavemen.

45:26.025 --> 45:27.398
People have a
right to protest.

45:27.400 --> 45:28.814
Okay, protesting is one thing

45:28.816 --> 45:30.731
but threatening to
disrupt the show's ending,

45:30.733 --> 45:33.814
whatever the hell that's supposed
to mean, is unacceptable.

45:33.816 --> 45:35.648
You don't like the show?

45:35.650 --> 45:37.314
Well neither do I,
and do you know why?

45:37.316 --> 45:38.773
Because there's a winner.

45:38.775 --> 45:41.148
One of these lunatics
gets to walk away free.

45:41.150 --> 45:43.148
And it makes me sick.

45:43.150 --> 45:45.066
If it were up to me they'd
all be dead already.

45:49.233 --> 45:51.733
[tense music]

46:02.358 --> 46:04.525
[roaring]

46:13.275 --> 46:15.025
That thing is huge.

46:31.608 --> 46:34.273
So why did you
enter the lottery?

46:34.275 --> 46:36.523
Same reason as everybody.

46:36.525 --> 46:37.358
Freedom.

46:40.108 --> 46:43.066
You really didn't
do it, did you?

46:44.108 --> 46:45.775
That's what I heard.

46:48.150 --> 46:51.066
Doesn't matter
much now, does it?

46:56.983 --> 46:58.398
Why do you think
they picked dinosaurs

46:58.400 --> 47:00.398
to be the things we're
running away from?

47:00.400 --> 47:01.398
[laughs]

47:01.400 --> 47:03.398
It tested better than robots.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.023
[chuckles mirthlessly]

47:05.025 --> 47:06.314
Look I dunno
man, gimme the map.

47:06.316 --> 47:07.731
You don't even know
how to operate it.

47:07.733 --> 47:09.648
I don't give a
damn, gimme the map!

47:09.650 --> 47:10.856
Kiss my ass!

47:10.858 --> 47:12.398
[screaming]

47:12.400 --> 47:13.400
[dramatic music]

47:15.108 --> 47:16.108
[distant screaming]

47:26.191 --> 47:28.400
[hitting]

47:31.941 --> 47:32.775
Help me!

47:37.400 --> 47:40.356
He's gonna die
anyway, leave his ass.

47:40.358 --> 47:43.941
No, he's gonna finish,
he's gonna make it.

47:49.275 --> 47:50.941
This is it for me.

47:54.066 --> 47:58.483
I was never gonna help you
anyway, you piece of shit.

48:01.025 --> 48:05.983
Your mom's gonna
follow me to hell.

48:09.566 --> 48:14.066
[shouting]
[stomping]

48:18.150 --> 48:19.481
It's nothing.

48:19.483 --> 48:20.689
Calm down!

48:20.691 --> 48:21.523
I'm not playing
this game anymore.

48:21.525 --> 48:22.358
I'm done!

48:25.066 --> 48:26.066
You hear me?

48:27.150 --> 48:27.983
I quit!

48:28.983 --> 48:31.523
- Put me back in my cell...
- Hey!

48:31.525 --> 48:32.358
I quit!

48:33.733 --> 48:35.689
I'm not playing
this game anymore!

48:35.691 --> 48:38.398
Hey!
[punches]

48:38.400 --> 48:39.733
It's you and me!

48:40.608 --> 48:41.814
It's you and me!

48:41.816 --> 48:44.606
We gotta stay together, focus!

48:44.608 --> 48:45.441
You focus.

48:46.525 --> 48:47.358
Focus.

48:56.566 --> 48:59.023
Well you didn't see
that coming, did ya?

48:59.025 --> 49:01.689
Our contestants are
tired, they're hungry.

49:01.691 --> 49:04.023
The Wasp is gone, but I have
a feeling it's about to get

49:04.025 --> 49:07.689
a whole lot tougher
for our remaining six.

49:07.691 --> 49:09.858
[Woman] And we're clear.

49:10.983 --> 49:12.439
How close are they
to the supplies?

49:12.441 --> 49:15.108
They're approaching right now.

49:16.025 --> 49:18.191
The buzzards are circling.

49:19.900 --> 49:23.358
[pterodactyls squawking]

49:34.025 --> 49:36.773
Welcome, contestants, and
congratulations on your success

49:36.775 --> 49:38.273
and survival.

49:38.275 --> 49:41.439
We're down to the final six
but we seem to be missing one.

49:41.441 --> 49:43.441
Ah, there she is.

49:44.358 --> 49:46.691
The odds-on favorite to win.

49:47.733 --> 49:48.731
I'm gonna kill you.

49:48.733 --> 49:49.939
[laughs]

49:49.941 --> 49:51.858
I sincerely doubt it.

49:53.066 --> 49:55.689
Beyond the red barrier
you will find two items

49:55.691 --> 49:58.356
that may be of some use to you.

49:58.358 --> 50:01.773
A knife, and, more importantly,
some more ammunition

50:01.775 --> 50:04.106
for your laser gun there.

50:04.108 --> 50:08.358
All you have to do is just
walk from here to there.

50:11.775 --> 50:15.025
[snorting and roaring]

50:24.858 --> 50:27.108
[explodes]

50:29.150 --> 50:30.941
There are 17 mines...

50:32.150 --> 50:36.273
Uh, well, maybe 20,
I can't remember.

50:36.275 --> 50:37.814
Between you and your reward.

50:37.816 --> 50:39.064
Don't worry.

50:39.066 --> 50:40.814
Stephanie's map will
guide you through.

50:40.816 --> 50:42.316
Use it to survive.

50:52.650 --> 50:54.606
[hits]
[shouts]

50:54.608 --> 50:56.606
Stop the game, I'm
not going through!

50:56.608 --> 50:57.731
Stop it!

50:57.733 --> 50:59.900
[shouting]

51:01.150 --> 51:01.983
Come on!

51:03.400 --> 51:04.983
What are you doing?

51:06.150 --> 51:09.064
Come on brother, come
on through, come on.

51:09.066 --> 51:13.400
No, no, come on!

51:13.941 --> 51:15.275
Come on, no, no!

51:16.400 --> 51:17.650
No, god damnit!

51:19.858 --> 51:20.691
No!

51:21.733 --> 51:22.566
Shit!

51:25.066 --> 51:25.900
No!

51:30.900 --> 51:33.233
[squawking]

51:35.025 --> 51:36.525
My brother's dead!

51:37.525 --> 51:40.066
[alarm blares]

51:52.900 --> 51:55.233
[screaming]

51:59.566 --> 52:01.898
[explodes]

52:01.900 --> 52:04.650
[exciting music]

52:06.233 --> 52:08.523
Back off, bitch.

52:08.525 --> 52:11.066
Who's the odds-on favorite now?

52:15.941 --> 52:18.358
[flatlining]

52:20.733 --> 52:22.439
Well there goes Cain and Abel.

52:22.441 --> 52:23.564
I'm not gonna do another
interview like that,

52:23.566 --> 52:24.564
not during the games.

52:24.566 --> 52:25.731
That was an ambush.

52:25.733 --> 52:26.606
Hey, look at these
ratings though.

52:26.608 --> 52:28.106
Look at 'em.

52:28.108 --> 52:32.273
And nice work, by the way,
Brian, with the pterodactyl.

52:32.275 --> 52:37.231
I gotta say, I am really
happy with our final four.

52:37.233 --> 52:39.606
You know Jack mentioned a
direct threat from The Cavemen.

52:39.608 --> 52:40.773
[sighs]

52:40.775 --> 52:41.814
He said they're
threatening to disrupt

52:41.816 --> 52:42.898
the ending of the show.

52:42.900 --> 52:44.523
Oh, The Cavemen.

52:44.525 --> 52:46.314
What are they going to
do Savannah, huh?

52:46.316 --> 52:47.564
What are they gonna do?

52:47.566 --> 52:48.773
Every year they
say the same shit.

52:48.775 --> 52:51.023
Every year nothing
happens except for what?

52:51.025 --> 52:52.439
More controversy.

52:52.441 --> 52:55.939
Controversy leads to excitement,
more excitement leads to

52:55.941 --> 52:57.106
more viewers.

52:57.108 --> 52:59.398
Hell, I love The Cavemen.

52:59.400 --> 53:00.773
Status report.

53:00.775 --> 53:01.606
Four remaining contestants
are relatively close

53:01.608 --> 53:03.314
to each other.

53:03.316 --> 53:04.939
Shut down most
of the main systems

53:04.941 --> 53:08.439
while I load the traps
and weather simulation.

53:08.441 --> 53:09.439
[sighs]

53:09.441 --> 53:10.689
You what, hey, hey.

53:10.691 --> 53:13.731
Why don't you let 'em
breathe for a minute?

53:13.733 --> 53:14.606
Never know.

53:14.608 --> 53:15.608
Maybe one of the
girls'll get naked.

53:17.775 --> 53:18.775
[birds calling]

53:20.650 --> 53:23.150
[tense music]

53:35.316 --> 53:37.816
She's watching us, you know.

53:44.233 --> 53:46.564
Maybe you oughta
give me that clip.

53:46.566 --> 53:48.066
Come and get it.

53:50.025 --> 53:52.689
I'd go look for her but I
don't wanna leave you alone.

53:52.691 --> 53:53.525
With him.

53:54.733 --> 53:55.733
Smart man.

53:57.525 --> 54:01.566
You move one inch closer
to me and I'll gut you.

54:03.066 --> 54:03.900
Alright.

54:05.316 --> 54:06.150
Alright.

54:11.025 --> 54:12.025
It's fine.

54:56.900 --> 55:00.233
You're not much
older than my daughter.

55:03.816 --> 55:04.900
I was asleep.

55:07.608 --> 55:11.108
And I heard a noise
and I went downstairs.

55:15.775 --> 55:18.566
And the door had
been pried open.

55:22.233 --> 55:25.731
And I went to the kids'
rooms and I made sure

55:25.733 --> 55:28.650
they were okay,
they were sleeping.

55:31.900 --> 55:34.566
And then I went back to my room.

55:36.150 --> 55:40.566
And I found my wife
with her throat slit.

55:45.525 --> 55:49.941
She was covered in blood
and her eyes were wide open.

55:55.816 --> 55:59.566
The murder weapon was
a knife from my kitchen

56:01.566 --> 56:03.731
and they said that I had
pried the door open myself

56:03.733 --> 56:06.816
to make it seem like
a home invasion.

56:10.566 --> 56:13.900
And I was convicted
and I was sentenced.

56:18.983 --> 56:20.483
You're just a kid.

56:25.941 --> 56:29.439
I'm gonna take
you to the final two

56:29.441 --> 56:31.358
and I'm gonna kill you.

56:33.358 --> 56:35.691
[screaming]

56:42.358 --> 56:43.189
[hitting]

56:43.191 --> 56:45.858
[intense music]

57:06.275 --> 57:08.691
[gun firing]

57:19.400 --> 57:20.233
Tucker!

57:21.400 --> 57:23.398
I know you're close!

57:23.400 --> 57:24.233
Tucker!

58:20.150 --> 58:21.148
[branch snaps]

58:21.150 --> 58:25.566
[hitting]
[shouting]

59:29.400 --> 59:30.233
Tucker!

59:34.775 --> 59:36.941
[wincing]

59:57.608 --> 01:00:02.358
[screaming]
[gun firing]

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.941
[laughing]

01:00:25.316 --> 01:00:26.814
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's come to my attention

01:00:26.816 --> 01:00:29.314
that one of our witnesses
would like to share something

01:00:29.316 --> 01:00:30.606
with us.

01:00:30.608 --> 01:00:32.691
[crying]

01:00:34.483 --> 01:00:39.439
He killed someone close
to you, didn't he?

01:00:39.441 --> 01:00:40.441
My husband.

01:00:43.108 --> 01:00:47.608
And now you feel like you
finally have some closure.

01:00:48.691 --> 01:00:51.358
Yes, yes I do.

01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.483
Hey, hey, it's okay.

01:00:56.983 --> 01:00:59.898
That is a natural feeling.

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:01.733
And we all understand.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.481
We're very close to finding out

01:01:06.483 --> 01:01:08.148
who will win this year's games.

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:09.316
Don't go away.

01:01:10.941 --> 01:01:12.814
Holy shit, who is this?

01:01:12.816 --> 01:01:13.981
[applauding]

01:01:13.983 --> 01:01:16.648
Whoa, the best
actress award goes to,

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:17.648
what was your name, sweetie?

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:19.356
- Alison.
- Alison.

01:01:19.358 --> 01:01:20.439
Give it up for Alison.

01:01:20.441 --> 01:01:21.606
She almost had me crying.

01:01:21.608 --> 01:01:23.023
[laughing]

01:01:23.025 --> 01:01:24.023
Can you believe that?

01:01:24.025 --> 01:01:25.273
We need more of her, seriously.

01:01:25.275 --> 01:01:26.814
Find out whoever her
acting class was.

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:30.941
I'm gonna go get a drink,
I'm a little emotional.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.608
[coughing]

01:02:54.108 --> 01:02:56.856
[growling]

01:02:56.858 --> 01:02:59.525
[dramatic music]

01:03:56.691 --> 01:03:59.650
[breathing heavily]

01:04:00.566 --> 01:04:01.400
My kids.

01:04:03.566 --> 01:04:05.689
If you can hear me.

01:04:05.691 --> 01:04:07.398
I love you.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.148
I'm coming home.

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:10.356
Dad!

01:04:10.358 --> 01:04:12.231
Do you hear that?

01:04:12.233 --> 01:04:13.566
I'm coming home!

01:04:14.691 --> 01:04:16.941
[groaning]

01:04:34.525 --> 01:04:36.775
[coughing]

01:04:59.733 --> 01:05:02.608
[Joy] You're not
looking so good.

01:05:14.191 --> 01:05:16.939
You're the one
that's gonna kill me?

01:05:16.941 --> 01:05:20.189
Oh honey, you're already dead.

01:05:20.191 --> 01:05:22.191
[kicks]

01:05:23.983 --> 01:05:26.233
[growling]

01:05:30.275 --> 01:05:31.439
We're getting immense
pressure from the press

01:05:31.441 --> 01:05:33.481
to comment on
Tucker's innocence.

01:05:33.483 --> 01:05:34.773
[groans]

01:05:34.775 --> 01:05:35.939
Okay, well here's my
comment to the press.

01:05:35.941 --> 01:05:38.398
He was sentenced to death.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.814
Okay we have run the numbers

01:05:39.816 --> 01:05:42.398
and it could be a ratings
disaster if he dies in the game.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.856
Are you out of your mind?

01:05:43.858 --> 01:05:44.856
What do you want?

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:46.106
You know what?

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:50.025
Come to me live as soon
as the tiger's finished.

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:55.941
[flatlining]

01:05:56.941 --> 01:05:58.606
Only two remain.

01:05:58.608 --> 01:06:03.356
Joy, the heartless teenage
killer, ruthless and crazy.

01:06:03.358 --> 01:06:06.023
Who knows why, who cares?

01:06:06.025 --> 01:06:10.189
And Tucker, a family man who
callously murdered his wife

01:06:10.191 --> 01:06:12.191
in cold blood.

01:06:12.566 --> 01:06:15.316
Presumed innocent
by some of you.

01:06:17.025 --> 01:06:18.150
Listen to me.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.983
I am not the judge.

01:06:22.108 --> 01:06:23.775
We are not the jury.

01:06:25.525 --> 01:06:26.650
But the game.

01:06:28.941 --> 01:06:31.275
The game is the executioner.

01:06:32.483 --> 01:06:36.150
And the game decides
who lives and who dies.

01:06:38.941 --> 01:06:40.814
Uh oh, we've got a problem.

01:06:40.816 --> 01:06:42.523
We just received an
encrypted message.

01:06:42.525 --> 01:06:43.773
From The Cavemen?

01:06:43.775 --> 01:06:46.398
No, from here,
inside the premises.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.856
Open the final doorway.

01:06:47.858 --> 01:06:50.148
The last challenge begins now.

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:52.858
[dramatic music]

01:07:13.233 --> 01:07:14.316
I told you!

01:07:15.733 --> 01:07:19.650
I told you I'd bring you
to the final two with me!

01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:37.856
Excuse me, I need to
get to master control.

01:07:37.858 --> 01:07:38.775
Sit down.

01:07:42.566 --> 01:07:45.064
We've intercepted an encoded
transmission coming from

01:07:45.066 --> 01:07:46.900
- the premises.
- Really?

01:07:48.066 --> 01:07:49.064
What did it say?

01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:50.064
We don't know.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.648
I was hoping you could tell me.

01:07:54.648 --> 01:07:58.564
We traced the transmission
back to your edit bay, Laura.

01:07:58.566 --> 01:08:01.733
Have you been sending
encoded messages?

01:08:03.523 --> 01:08:05.314
I'm going to kill The Host.

01:08:05.316 --> 01:08:06.273
On live TV.

01:08:07.607 --> 01:08:08.440
Tonight.

01:08:09.316 --> 01:08:11.648
[gun fires]

01:08:14.566 --> 01:08:18.064
No matter what you do,
the show will continue.

01:08:18.066 --> 01:08:20.314
It's bigger than me,
than you, than anyone!

01:08:20.316 --> 01:08:23.816
You'll never...
[gun fires]

01:09:00.357 --> 01:09:02.357
[spits]

01:09:03.982 --> 01:09:05.979
Let's do this.

01:09:05.982 --> 01:09:07.479
Patience, Tucker.

01:09:07.482 --> 01:09:09.979
Joy, you are the favorite
to win this thing, you know.

01:09:09.982 --> 01:09:11.145
Eat shit!

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:12.645
That's the spirit.

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:16.189
Tucker, I'm not sure anyone
expected you to get this far

01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:19.104
but there are millions of people
rooting for you out there.

01:09:19.107 --> 01:09:23.689
In fact, we have a very
special message from your kids.

01:09:24.982 --> 01:09:26.898
Survive, Dad, please.

01:09:28.523 --> 01:09:29.689
We know you're innocent.

01:09:29.691 --> 01:09:30.773
Get him out of the games.

01:09:30.774 --> 01:09:32.607
- Stop the games!
- Andy.

01:09:35.857 --> 01:09:37.274
Bring 'em back.

01:09:39.107 --> 01:09:41.814
Bring 'em back, bring 'em back!

01:09:41.816 --> 01:09:43.566
Bring 'em back to me!

01:09:44.566 --> 01:09:45.398
Ow!

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:47.691
[groaning]

01:09:52.857 --> 01:09:54.107
Why so upset?

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:57.730
We are giving you a
chance to see them again.

01:09:57.732 --> 01:09:59.564
I mean really if it wasn't
for our little show here,

01:09:59.566 --> 01:10:01.400
you'd already be dead.

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:05.565
And let the final
challenge begin.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.898
Well, this is an easy game.

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.564
Now you will notice that
you are each chained

01:10:22.566 --> 01:10:24.314
to those locks.

01:10:24.316 --> 01:10:25.939
There are padlocks at
the end of your chains

01:10:25.941 --> 01:10:28.189
that need to be unlocked
for you to cross the outer

01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:29.191
finish line.

01:10:30.566 --> 01:10:34.064
Be the first to do so, and your
opponent will be eliminated.

01:10:34.066 --> 01:10:34.900
You win!

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.273
The keys.

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:38.980
Excuse me?

01:10:38.982 --> 01:10:41.105
I don't think I
quite caught that.

01:10:41.107 --> 01:10:43.730
Where are the keys
to unlock the padlocks?

01:10:43.732 --> 01:10:44.855
There are two.

01:10:44.857 --> 01:10:46.773
One for each of you.

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:48.480
Buried in the sand
somewhere between

01:10:48.482 --> 01:10:51.023
where you stand and the locks.

01:10:51.025 --> 01:10:54.107
Are you ready in
three, two, one, go!

01:10:55.691 --> 01:10:58.316
[intense music]

01:11:07.941 --> 01:11:08.775
Tucker.

01:11:10.691 --> 01:11:14.773
Do you know why I threw
in my name for the games?

01:11:14.775 --> 01:11:17.148
I don't care about my freedom.

01:11:17.150 --> 01:11:20.189
Hell, being in here is as
close as I could ever hope

01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:21.358
to being free.

01:11:25.107 --> 01:11:27.773
A girl that does things that
I do won't last very long

01:11:27.775 --> 01:11:30.439
in the real world
anyway, you know?

01:11:30.441 --> 01:11:32.814
[kicks]

01:11:32.816 --> 01:11:34.523
I wanted to meet you!

01:11:34.525 --> 01:11:35.814
[cries out]

01:11:35.816 --> 01:11:38.855
Convicted killer that
the whole world loves.

01:11:38.857 --> 01:11:40.814
The man that wanted
to join the games

01:11:40.816 --> 01:11:44.564
so he could see his
precious kids again.

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.064
The man that everyone cried over

01:11:46.066 --> 01:11:47.898
when his sentence was given.

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.980
I mean what the hell?

01:11:48.982 --> 01:11:50.650
You talk too much.

01:11:51.566 --> 01:11:54.105
[laughs]

01:11:54.107 --> 01:11:56.355
She cried for you.

01:11:56.357 --> 01:11:57.525
She missed you.

01:11:58.732 --> 01:12:00.355
She said that you were
gonna come save her

01:12:00.357 --> 01:12:02.689
and I really wish you
would have because I was

01:12:02.691 --> 01:12:04.605
so tired of waiting.

01:12:04.607 --> 01:12:07.064
[hits]

01:12:07.066 --> 01:12:09.900
I'm here to finish
what I started!

01:12:11.691 --> 01:12:15.773
I can't let the whole
world see you go free!

01:12:15.775 --> 01:12:20.939
I'm gonna cause one more
moment of chaos and heartbreak

01:12:20.941 --> 01:12:24.191
before I leave this
disgusting world!

01:12:28.066 --> 01:12:31.314
I killed your bitch of a
wife and I would do it again

01:12:31.316 --> 01:12:34.480
[punching]
and again and again

01:12:34.482 --> 01:12:37.400
if I could!

01:12:38.357 --> 01:12:39.523
Yes.

01:12:39.525 --> 01:12:41.273
Yes, this is perfect,
this is perfect.

01:12:41.275 --> 01:12:43.148
This is awesome!

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:44.355
You knew?

01:12:44.357 --> 01:12:47.065
Well, I mean,
you know, we hoped.

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:54.066
See you in hell,
you piece of shit!

01:12:56.941 --> 01:12:58.105
What did you say to me?

01:12:58.107 --> 01:13:00.357
I said I killed your wife.

01:13:01.816 --> 01:13:04.023
What did you say to me?

01:13:04.025 --> 01:13:05.355
Uh, give me a rex.

01:13:05.357 --> 01:13:06.564
Bring in a rex.

01:13:06.566 --> 01:13:09.064
I said I killed her, ah!

01:13:09.066 --> 01:13:10.648
I'm gonna kill you.

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:11.939
Where, Savannah!

01:13:11.941 --> 01:13:13.108
We need a rex.

01:13:14.107 --> 01:13:15.355
Will you just, where is she?

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:16.730
Do I have to do
everything myself?

01:13:16.732 --> 01:13:18.023
Just bring it out.

01:13:18.025 --> 01:13:19.023
Savannah!

01:13:19.025 --> 01:13:21.273
[laughing]

01:13:21.275 --> 01:13:23.441
[roaring]

01:14:11.816 --> 01:14:13.189
Come on.

01:14:13.191 --> 01:14:14.814
Oh God, get out of the way!

01:14:14.816 --> 01:14:17.316
Let's have some fun, shall we?

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:26.316
[roaring]

01:15:01.316 --> 01:15:03.064
What are they doing, why
aren't they attacking them?

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:04.523
We programmed them
to behave the same way

01:15:04.525 --> 01:15:06.480
that they would in nature
and they're very territorial.

01:15:06.482 --> 01:15:07.689
We've never had
this many at once

01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:08.564
so I don't know what
they're gonna do.

01:15:08.566 --> 01:15:09.898
Well then fix it!

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.066
[roaring]

01:15:45.732 --> 01:15:48.565
Oh shit!

01:15:59.025 --> 01:16:01.066
[shouts]

01:17:18.607 --> 01:17:20.980
[cheering]

01:17:20.982 --> 01:17:21.815
Yes!

01:17:23.357 --> 01:17:25.525
[beeping]

01:17:33.775 --> 01:17:36.275
[eerie music]

01:17:56.066 --> 01:17:57.939
- Pull him out now.
- What?

01:17:57.941 --> 01:17:59.189
[gun cocks]

01:17:59.191 --> 01:18:02.230
Whoa, whoa, Laura,
what are you doing?

01:18:02.232 --> 01:18:03.898
Wake him up, slowly.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.439
Brian, go to
commercial, right now.

01:18:05.441 --> 01:18:07.564
No Brian, bring it here, now.

01:18:07.566 --> 01:18:08.814
Laura, look at me, look at me.

01:18:08.816 --> 01:18:11.355
This has to be some kind
of a misunderstanding.

01:18:11.357 --> 01:18:13.773
The game is over for good.

01:18:13.775 --> 01:18:14.773
Okay.

01:18:14.775 --> 01:18:15.773
Where's Savannah?

01:18:15.775 --> 01:18:16.730
Savannah!

01:18:16.732 --> 01:18:17.939
This has gone on long enough!

01:18:17.941 --> 01:18:19.230
Tonight this is over.

01:18:19.232 --> 01:18:21.230
There will be no
more Jurassic Games.

01:18:21.232 --> 01:18:23.023
Okay, Laura, what are you,
stop, what are you doing?

01:18:23.025 --> 01:18:23.939
This is crazy.

01:18:23.941 --> 01:18:24.855
Jeff.

01:18:24.857 --> 01:18:25.773
Are you serious?

01:18:25.775 --> 01:18:26.814
I've known you 10 years.

01:18:26.816 --> 01:18:27.689
Are you kidding me?

01:18:27.691 --> 01:18:28.648
What is happening right
now, are you crazy?

01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:29.648
[Laura] You're going in.

01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:30.480
What?

01:18:30.482 --> 01:18:31.314
No!

01:18:31.316 --> 01:18:32.148
Stop!

01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:32.980
Stop it right now!

01:18:32.982 --> 01:18:33.815
Stop it!

01:18:42.441 --> 01:18:44.691
[growling]

01:18:46.566 --> 01:18:47.605
Brian.

01:18:47.607 --> 01:18:49.900
If I don't call off that
T-Rex, it will kill him.

01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:52.730
You're not gonna shoot me.

01:18:52.732 --> 01:18:54.480
[shoots]

01:18:54.482 --> 01:18:56.273
[screaming]

01:18:56.275 --> 01:18:58.898
Bring it to me live, now.

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.023
It's over, everyone.

01:19:00.025 --> 01:19:01.564
It's over.

01:19:01.566 --> 01:19:04.855
Now watch this evil piece
of shit learn his lesson.

01:19:04.857 --> 01:19:05.855
Back to the desert.

01:19:05.857 --> 01:19:06.690
Do it!

01:19:07.816 --> 01:19:10.025

01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:20.314
Okay.

01:19:20.316 --> 01:19:21.689
Alright.

01:19:21.691 --> 01:19:23.189
Come on baby, make it good.

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:24.650
Let's fucking go!

01:21:40.232 --> 01:21:42.939
during the finale of this past
season of the Jurassic Games.

01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:44.814
People all over the
world are still mourning

01:21:44.816 --> 01:21:46.855
the death of the beloved host.

01:21:46.857 --> 01:21:49.148
It was tragic for sure.

01:21:49.150 --> 01:21:50.980
But, you know what they say.

01:21:50.982 --> 01:21:51.980
The show must go on!

01:21:51.982 --> 01:21:53.189

01:21:53.191 --> 01:21:54.730
Wait, what are you saying?

01:21:54.732 --> 01:21:56.355
Do you know something
we don't know?

01:21:56.357 --> 01:21:59.855
