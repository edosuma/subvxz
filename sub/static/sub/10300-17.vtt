01:32.760 --> 01:34.352
Good evening.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.955
Is something bothering Daddy?

01:38.160 --> 01:41.232
He's just preparing to do his taxes.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.799
Yikes and gadzooks.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.315
And here we go.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.189
Look what the IRS is doing to Daddy.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.152
First it is poor Willie Nelson...

01:54.360 --> 01:57.158
...who brings us...
Brings us so much joy...

01:57.360 --> 01:59.999
...and amasses a fortune.
They take it away.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.112
Next they set their sights
on Redd Foxx.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.432
They drive him to Royal Family...

02:05.640 --> 02:08.551
...and you know he wasn't
gonna live long after that.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.031
Well, it always comes in threes.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.754
And which American idol
do they turn to next?

02:14.960 --> 02:16.837
Al Bundy.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.880
Well, I'll never star on Royal Family.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.595
Wouldn't mind doing an episode or two
of Growing Pains or something...

02:29.120 --> 02:31.156
...but I don't wanna be on ABC.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.708
Now, take it easy, Dad.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.717
Look at the size of this bill.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.957
They're trying to take away everything
I've earned over 20 years.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.037
- Oh, no, Al.
- Yes.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.468
Forty-four dollars.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.757
You try to get just
a little bit ahead and then...

02:54.160 --> 02:56.549
Daddy, is there something
that we can do to help?

02:58.080 --> 03:01.311
Well, get part-time jobs
and help Dad out.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.638
No, seriously, Al.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.273
What can we do?

03:09.480 --> 03:10.913
Hey, I have an idea.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.430
Why don't you just give the government
the bird and not pay the taxes.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.717
Kelly, you can't cheat
the government.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.593
Pretty soon they'll tack on
interest and penalty payments...

03:19.800 --> 03:23.395
...and before you know it,
in a few years this will be 50, 60 bucks.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.597
Then you got the monkey
on your back for the rest of your life.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.950
Forty-four dollars.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.953
They could take the house.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.954
Great. Then we'd still owe $30.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.112
Why, it's Steve.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.039
- Steve Rhoades.
- Don't shout.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.231
Just shut the door.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.348
Open the door. I'm on the run,
you nitwits.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.276
- But he said to shut it.
- What do we do now?

04:17.480 --> 04:18.913
Don't know.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.031
I don't know,
it's like he wants two things.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.959
Well, I was gonna ask what's new...

04:31.160 --> 04:34.596
...but obviously you've all gone
to college since I left town.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.236
I left town years ago.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.512
- Left Marcie, became a forest ranger.
- He went to Yosemite.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.517
- Oh, that's right.
- That's where he went.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.395
- Sit down.
- Yeah, forest ranging.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.192
That was the life.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.756
Just me and the wind,
roaming free where no man goes.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.150
Wow, it must have been
a pretty strong wind.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.513
- So...
- Steve.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.115
Steve, what are you doing here?

05:07.600 --> 05:09.318
I brought this.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.634
Back, jackals, you can't eat this.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.831
This is a genuine double-breasted...

05:17.040 --> 05:19.395
...speckle-ruffed,
weenie canyon hawk.

05:22.440 --> 05:26.513
This hawk is as rare to this country
as soap is to you people.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.272
They were going to take it to a lab.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.038
Well, someone had to stop them.

05:33.240 --> 05:38.314
Someone with courage, with
conviction and real American guts.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.751
So I bribed a Boy Scout
to climb up and get it for me.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.758
It cost me a quarter, but I wasn't
the one who broke my leg...

05:44.960 --> 05:47.030
...falling out of the tree.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.559
So here I stand,
the proud ecowarrior.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.320
And I must say, I feel the hero.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.669
Gee, Steve, you're leading
a darned interesting life.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.799
It's too bad Alfalfa's dead...

06:01.000 --> 06:04.675
...because he would have made
a good you in the movie of your life.

06:08.200 --> 06:13.638
Well, to be honest, there is
another reason I came back.

06:13.840 --> 06:17.674
Well, I never considered
that $50 a loan, Steve.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.553
Not that, you imbecile.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.638
I came to re-claim my wife.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.630
Steve, I think there's something
that you should...

06:28.840 --> 06:32.913
Peg, the man has travelled
many a mile.

06:34.880 --> 06:38.759
Let's not keep him from the bosom
of his woman...

06:38.960 --> 06:41.269
...wherever it may be.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.348
Thanks. But, you know, it's funny, my
key doesn't seem to work in the door.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.989
Oh, here. Try one of ours.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.837
Let's see, the Murphys,
the Mullens, the Levins.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.473
- Here.
- Oh, good.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.154
Now, don't tell Marcie.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.998
I wanna surprise her.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.113
Okay.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.909
You might want to cover
the children's ears.

07:12.120 --> 07:15.795
There may be some noises
youngsters shouldn't hear.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.558
We're counting on it.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.196
Marcie...

07:32.840 --> 07:35.070
...Daddy's home.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.993
I guess I'll wake her like I used to.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.957
You're letting your hair
grow long again.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.995
Feels just like silk.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.112
Thanks. I conditioned it tonight.

07:59.320 --> 08:02.471
That's good. You know,
with your texture...

08:05.760 --> 08:07.113
- What are you doing?
- Intruder!

08:07.320 --> 08:09.038
- Marcie!
- Steve!

08:12.240 --> 08:14.390
You getting all this, Bud?

08:15.760 --> 08:18.399
Wow, look at them running around.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.751
Hey, how come I can't see anything?

08:26.160 --> 08:28.116
I got him, you guys. Over here.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.595
- How dare you?
- It's an outrage!

08:30.800 --> 08:32.950
This is an outrage!

08:33.280 --> 08:37.273
Hey, where'd
that little guy come from?

08:38.039 --> 08:39.951
It's Marcie.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.197
No! No!

08:44.400 --> 08:49.349
Oh, God, Al, look at the mayhem
and carnage you caused.

08:49.560 --> 08:54.156
You know, every now
and then I really love you.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.675
He's your husband?

09:07.880 --> 09:11.873
Were you hurt so bad when
I divorced you that you'd marry this?

09:12.080 --> 09:13.832
Whoa, the desperation.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.714
This is the mighty Steve?

09:17.920 --> 09:20.593
The one you used
to throw in my face?

09:20.800 --> 09:25.237
The one who wasn't much to look at,
but at least he's got a job?

09:28.040 --> 09:29.871
You know, you gigolos make me sick.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.036
You think because
a man divorces his wife...

09:32.240 --> 09:34.356
...you can move right in
and marry her?

09:34.560 --> 09:36.630
Well, I'm back.

09:36.840 --> 09:40.879
So you can just pack up
your hair and profile...

09:41.560 --> 09:43.357
...and find another heartbroken...

09:43.560 --> 09:46.632
...discarded middle-aged
woman to marry...

09:47.320 --> 09:50.039
...and leave us decent folk
to our happy home.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.517
Pardon me, Yogi.

09:54.920 --> 09:59.869
You're not wanted here.
Marcie's got a real man now.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.435
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

10:01.640 --> 10:05.235
Well, according
to my watch, it's 10:22.

10:05.440 --> 10:10.560
When I was married to her,
we were never sleeping at 10:22.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.439
She's just resting.

10:16.640 --> 10:20.553
She's been on
the Tilt-A-Whirl since 6 p.m.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.358
- Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:24.560 --> 10:28.951
- Ever taken her in the kitchen?
- On and off the table.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.675
- Front yard, baby?
- Firehouse.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.108
- Dairy Queen.
- U-Lube It.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.278
- In a homeless person's shopping cart.
- Really?

10:36.480 --> 10:39.153
- How do you keep it from rolling? L...
- You see the wheels...

10:39.360 --> 10:41.510
Excuse me!

10:45.360 --> 10:49.114
Gentlemen, but I have
something I'd like to say here.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.312
Ta-ta, little nose.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.114
- I knew she'd come crawling back.
- Crawling?

10:54.360 --> 10:55.679
To you?

10:55.880 --> 10:59.509
"Ha-ha," I say.
I wouldn't crawl to you...

10:59.720 --> 11:04.714
...if I had a date with Mel Gibson, and
you had the last diaphragm on Earth.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.317
Me neither.

11:13.640 --> 11:17.189
Despite what you think,
you are not God's gift to women.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.910
Oh, yeah? Tell that to
the burly Earth First! Babes...

11:21.120 --> 11:24.430
...who come out every spring
looking for baby moose and loving.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.158
They may not shave like you and I...

11:27.360 --> 11:30.432
...but they can fill out a flannel shirt,
I can tell you that.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.951
Then why are you back?

11:34.160 --> 11:36.151
I'll tell you why you're back.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.920
You're back for this.

11:43.760 --> 11:48.117
I'm blind! My eyes! My eyes!

11:53.200 --> 11:55.236
That's right.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.079
Read them and weep.

12:00.160 --> 12:04.153
They answer to another man's
whistle now.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.351
That's me, right?

12:08.920 --> 12:11.753
Just shut up and look pretty.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.149
And you, you can tell
your story walking.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.355
- I know you don't mean that.
- Oh, don't I?

12:21.560 --> 12:23.755
- Jefferson.
- Yeah.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.355
Take me right now.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.918
Honey...

12:32.120 --> 12:36.875
...Mr. Bashful might be a little,
you know, under the weather...

12:37.280 --> 12:38.918
...what with the ex here and all.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.714
Do it and do it now!

12:43.960 --> 12:47.794
- He's looking at me.
- Oh, God, you are such a baby!

12:48.000 --> 12:51.834
All right. Just lie there.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.637
Okay.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.549
I get the message.

12:59.280 --> 13:02.590
But before I walk
out the door for the last time...

13:02.800 --> 13:05.872
...what's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.231
Take this to your grave.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.196
Now I'm blind too!

13:24.560 --> 13:28.030
And none of you
could tell me she was married?

13:29.400 --> 13:33.075
We don't like to use the M-word
in front of the children.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.279
Open up, it's the FBI.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.273
That could just be for me...

13:40.480 --> 13:43.199
...since stealing this egg
is a federal offence.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.029
Oh, and if you get any ideas,
so is harbouring me.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.595
If you need me,
I'll be in the basement.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.795
Hello, Agent Mahoney, FBI.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.558
Have you seen this man?

14:05.440 --> 14:07.635
Have you seen this egg?

14:08.040 --> 14:11.476
They're known to be in the area.
Have you seen either of them?

14:11.720 --> 14:13.950
Let me tell you something.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.874
I served my country.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.799
I played high school football.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.790
Four touchdowns in one game.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.276
Yet I'm not exempt
from state and federal taxes.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.233
Now, is this any way America
should treat its heroes?

14:29.440 --> 14:33.479
So you just flash that badge
at some registered voter, buddy.

14:34.680 --> 14:35.908
We're Bundys.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.997
We hate cops.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.474
I feel good.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.716
Let's watch TV.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.832
And now this news brief.

14:54.040 --> 14:57.077
Former local man, Steven Rhoades,
is being sought by authorities...

14:57.280 --> 15:00.397
...for his theft of the egg
of a nearly extinct species of hawk.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.398
He's believed to be
insane and dangerous.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.750
If you see him,
call the police immediately.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.916
- Go chase yourself.
- Hey, we...

15:08.120 --> 15:09.394
We're Bundys.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.999
We don't call cops.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.317
- People call them on us.
- That's right, baby.

15:14.520 --> 15:18.877
There's a $10, 000 reward
for information leading to his arrest.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.275
Now, wait a second now. Hold it now.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.040
Hold it now. Get off me here. Careful.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.630
Wait a second. Wait a second now!

15:28.640 --> 15:29.914
Family...

15:30.120 --> 15:32.509
...have we forgotten our principles?

15:32.720 --> 15:35.518
Is $10,000 more important
to us than a friend?

15:35.880 --> 15:37.916
- Damn right.
- Get out of here.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.917
Get back, away from the phone.

15:40.120 --> 15:43.112
Al. This is $10,000.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.830
Now, I know in the shoe business
$10,000 is like Bigfoot.

15:47.040 --> 15:51.113
People claim to have seen it, but
no one's actually laid their hands on it.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.311
Do you know what
we could do with this money?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.439
Doesn't matter.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.278
Family, gather around me.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.472
Gather around.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.236
Now, do you know why
we shouldn't turn Steve in?

16:04.440 --> 16:07.238
Because we already have so much?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.274
No.

16:09.480 --> 16:13.553
We should not turn Steve in because
the authorities want us to turn Steve in.

16:13.760 --> 16:17.958
Now I say we should all form
a united Bundy front against authority.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.152
Can I get a "Whoa, united Bundy front
against authority"?

16:21.360 --> 16:25.831
Whoa, united Bundy front
against authority.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.079
The only thing that's important here...

16:38.680 --> 16:41.478
...is the fact that we care about Steve.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.069
We should always... What?

16:45.640 --> 16:47.995
Hello, police. This is an emergency.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.470
Hey, you canaries.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.275
- So I see you can't be trusted.
- Oh, Al, it's $10,000.

16:54.520 --> 16:58.308
I don't care. Nobody here
calls the cops while I'm still alive.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.031
What's this?

17:09.240 --> 17:14.633
Oh, I thought you might be thirsty,
so I fixed you some nice Tang.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.868
Tang don't smoke.

17:21.119 --> 17:25.271
Well, Daddy, it's the new
and improved smoking Tang...

17:25.480 --> 17:28.870
...chocked-full of vitamins
and ministers.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.995
Bottoms up, Dad.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.275
Hi, I just came to talk to Steve.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.794
Really?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.230
Well, then why
isn't Jefferson with you?

17:42.440 --> 17:45.477
I thought he wouldn't leave
your side with Steve hanging around.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.676
Jefferson is a mature human being...

17:47.880 --> 17:50.110
...fully secure in his masculinity.

18:07.880 --> 18:11.839
Steve, I wanna talk to you.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.079
Marcie...

18:16.280 --> 18:21.149
...I see you dumped the pretty
wrapping for the total package.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.511
Steve, I've got something to say.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.632
Last night things were said
in the heat of the moment...

18:27.840 --> 18:29.876
...and I may have hurt your feelings.

18:30.080 --> 18:33.470
- I've already forgotten that.
- No, let me remind you.

18:36.400 --> 18:40.598
Look at this and see
what you'll never have again!

18:47.720 --> 18:52.350
Peg, I'm blind. I saw it again
and it's all darkness.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.270
Well, here, honey, drink this.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.038
That's right.

18:59.240 --> 19:03.028
What you see is what you don't get.

19:03.240 --> 19:08.075
So drool on, dream on, move on.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.599
Marcie.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.678
Oh, that's what I wanted to hear.

19:15.880 --> 19:19.077
Oh, I knew you loved me.

19:20.600 --> 19:24.149
Now tell me who looks the fool.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.191
Come on, honey.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.548
Why are you wet?

19:30.760 --> 19:33.991
Oh, it's not what you think,
it's just dog pee.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.596
You know, I have lived here
my whole life...

19:38.800 --> 19:41.917
...and I never knew
that our bush could talk.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.629
Well, Kel, I'm sure our bushes
felt the same way about you.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.518
Well, now I know it's truly over.

19:55.720 --> 19:59.190
The Marcie I married would never
have beaten around with that bush.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.879
But whenever I start
to feel this way...

20:04.080 --> 20:07.595
...I'm reminded of an old Ute saying.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.676
That means when
you see the tepee rocking...

20:13.880 --> 20:15.836
...don't come a-knocking.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.075
But I'll tell you this:

20:20.680 --> 20:22.796
When you look at the big picture...

20:23.000 --> 20:25.833
...the only thing that really counts
is friendship.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.314
FBI, nobody move.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.591
Traitors. Judases.

20:33.800 --> 20:39.113
You turned me in.
Well, I put a Ute curse on you all.

20:51.360 --> 20:54.432
Now there's no chance
of getting that reward.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.756
Mom, I think I can help.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.076
Hey, wait a minute.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.118
Hey, you FBI guys.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.870
We hid him out. Don't we deserve
something for that?

21:11.120 --> 21:13.190
Yes, according to the law, you do.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.953
Cuff them, boys.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.957
Go easy on the big guy.

21:17.160 --> 21:20.789
He played high school football
for our country.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.830
Well, see, Daddy, now thanks to me,
we're gonna get our reward.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.878
Sweetheart, my reward
was the day you were born.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.872
Just give me...!

21:40.920 --> 21:42.399
Hey, wait a minute.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.636
We didn't turn him in.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.831
Who could have done this?

22:02.520 --> 22:05.080
And so ends another
episode of Buck Bundy...

22:05.280 --> 22:08.272
...environmentally correct briard.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.674
If you should witness a crime
against Mother Nature...

22:11.880 --> 22:14.872
...don't be afraid to call your dog.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.389
It's not just a good idea...

22:17.600 --> 22:19.795
...it's the law.
