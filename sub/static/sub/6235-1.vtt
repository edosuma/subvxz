No!

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:23.574
She must be really like you.
Just walking in that like that.

01:20:23.574 --> 01:20:27.536
Ms Cuminseed, come in. Please. Please!

01:20:27.578 --> 01:20:33.625
Well, it's been nice knowing you kid.
It's over. End of the line. Final cutton.

01:20:33.667 --> 01:20:36.587
The last to ride.

01:20:36.587 --> 01:20:39.756
Wait it the minute.
Said that again.

01:20:40.632 --> 01:20:41.633
The last to ride.

01:20:41.675 --> 01:20:43.677
No, what you said about Ms Cuminseed.

01:20:43.677 --> 01:20:45.762
Oh, that she really like you. She must have.

01:20:45.762 --> 01:20:48.765
Hetty Cuminseed wouldn't do that
for just to anyone.

01:20:48.849 --> 01:20:50.851
- That's it.
- And I can't find it why.

01:20:50.893 --> 01:20:55.647
- But you must have like her too.
- That's the reason it's trying to separate us.

01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:56.815
It afraid to us.

01:20:56.857 --> 01:20:58.734
Afraid of what we are.

01:20:58.775 --> 01:21:02.613
Filson doesn't have stand a chance againts it
because he was there by himself.

01:21:02.613 --> 01:21:06.700
He didn't have anyone there with him.
He doesn't have any friends.

01:21:06.825 --> 01:21:10.704
I know we're dead and everything.
But can you please not touch anything?

01:21:10.746 --> 01:21:13.707
It's really expensive.

01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:21.590
Yugo, no!

01:21:26.637 --> 01:21:28.931
Don't get out while you still can.

01:21:28.931 --> 01:21:30.849
Thanks for everything.

01:21:30.849 --> 01:21:34.812
You've been the best one I ever had.
Well, honestly.

01:21:34.812 --> 01:21:38.690
- You're the only one.
- No, Yugo, you can't give up!

01:21:38.732 --> 01:21:41.902
I'm so cold.

01:21:43.821 --> 01:21:46.698
Yugo!

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.923
[SCREAMING]

01:22:26.738 --> 01:22:27.948
Ms Cuminseed.

01:22:28.699 --> 01:22:30.701
Hetty.

01:22:35.998 --> 01:22:39.710
Thompson? Did you just slap me
across the face?

01:22:43.881 --> 01:22:44.923
Where are we?

01:22:44.923 --> 01:22:48.760
We're inside the IAJ.

01:22:48.802 --> 01:22:51.889
We're inside the IAJ?

01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:55.893
Well, it's definetely vast.

01:22:55.934 --> 01:22:57.853
I know the secret.

01:22:57.853 --> 01:23:04.776
The IAJ is terrifed the warm,
affection, and love.

01:23:04.818 --> 01:23:07.821
Oh, Tom Thompson,
now you're getting sentimental.

01:23:07.821 --> 01:23:11.950
Ms Cuminseed.
Do you feel anything for me?

01:23:11.992 --> 01:23:14.995
You're eleven.

01:23:14.995 --> 01:23:16.997
And you're really not my type.

01:23:17.039 --> 01:23:20.042
Oh, I don't mean that.

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:24.796
I love my parents,
even I know they are so annoying.

01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:28.759
I even love my stockup sister.
I love Yugo.

01:23:28.842 --> 01:23:31.804
What do you love, Hetty?

01:23:34.848 --> 01:23:40.896
Well, I.. I.. I appreciated
some solid ghost hunting.

01:23:40.896 --> 01:23:44.900
Alright, it's not enough. You
can do better. Please.

01:23:44.942 --> 01:23:47.945
You walk straight to the mouth of IAJ.

01:23:47.945 --> 01:23:53.784
Why? Why? Said it! If you said it.
We're going home.

01:23:53.826 --> 01:23:58.038
Got that? Have you got that?

01:24:03.836 --> 01:24:05.838
Listen.

01:24:05.879 --> 01:24:08.006
Tom Thompson.

01:24:09.007 --> 01:24:14.847
You're the bravest boy I have ever known.

01:24:14.847 --> 01:24:17.766
Because you stand up for what you believing.

01:24:17.766 --> 01:24:19.977
Even to me.

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:23.814
Most at all can't do that.

01:24:23.939 --> 01:24:28.861
And if anything ever happened to you..

01:24:28.902 --> 01:24:32.030
I'll not forgiving myself.

01:24:34.867 --> 01:24:37.077
I'm gotta like you.

01:24:38.829 --> 01:24:41.874
Very-very much.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.042
I kinda like you.

01:24:44.918 --> 01:24:49.923
I like you. And I even like that ghost to yours.

01:24:49.965 --> 01:24:52.968
Although he still way pin a butt.

01:24:53.010 --> 01:24:55.095
But I like him.
I like him.

01:24:55.095 --> 01:24:58.849
I like you too, Ms Cuminseed.

01:25:11.862 --> 01:25:14.990
You hear that? You stupid IAJ.

01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:20.037
She likes me and I like her.
We're friend.

01:25:20.996 --> 01:25:26.126
- We're friend.
- We're friend.

01:25:29.046 --> 01:25:30.130

01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:33.091

01:26:24.017 --> 01:26:26.019
See that, Cuminseed?

01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:28.188
No big deal, just save the world.

01:26:28.230 --> 01:26:31.942
Top notch ghosthunting, slime ball?

01:26:34.027 --> 01:26:37.114
Okay, everything is under control.

01:26:37.114 --> 01:26:42.077
We'll take it from here. Ups.
Look like we got here in the time.

01:26:42.161 --> 01:26:45.956
Cuminseed, you really done it this time.

01:26:45.998 --> 01:26:48.083
Hopkins ain't gonna like this.

01:26:48.083 --> 01:26:53.922
- Take her away. Ah, no need to thank me, chief.
- Just a minute, Somit.

01:26:53.964 --> 01:26:56.216
Had it under control the whole time.

01:26:56.258 --> 01:26:59.052
May I..

01:27:01.972 --> 01:27:04.057
Oh, come on, not again.

01:27:04.099 --> 01:27:09.146
Ah, I wanted to do that for so long.

01:27:11.190 --> 01:27:14.234
Cuminseed.

01:27:15.027 --> 01:27:16.153
You did it.

01:27:16.195 --> 01:27:19.239
Obviously I was knew you would.

01:27:30.042 --> 01:27:34.004
But how about we starting
to what left in my office.

01:27:35.005 --> 01:27:37.966
I want you back on my team.

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:45.015
Sorry, Hopkins. I got a new team.
One is on my style.

01:27:45.015 --> 01:27:49.061
Although you know where to find us.
Next time we're the last hope.

01:27:50.145 --> 01:27:56.026
If you'll excuse me now, I've gotta save
a live after death of a friend of mine.

01:28:11.333 --> 01:28:13.293
Come on, Hugo.

01:28:13.335 --> 01:28:16.338
I brought you home, your home.

01:28:16.338 --> 01:28:19.049

01:28:19.174 --> 01:28:21.301
Don't leave me.

01:28:22.177 --> 01:28:25.055
You're my friend.

01:28:33.313 --> 01:28:36.108

01:28:56.086 --> 01:29:01.175
Not bad. Eleven years old smartass

01:29:01.216 --> 01:29:03.135

Back there, were you even..

01:29:14.313 --> 01:29:17.191
a little bit scared?

01:29:18.192 --> 01:29:25.115
You mean when I was swallowed half frozen by
primeval ice Monster and almost perished along
with the entire human race?

01:29:25.157 --> 01:29:27.367
Yes.

01:29:29.203 --> 01:29:34.291
Let's just say I absolutely
totally 100 percent...

01:29:34.374 --> 01:29:37.377

01:29:42.174 --> 01:29:45.260
Oh oh oh oh!

01:30:55.455 --> 01:31:00.419
Oh that's like so embarassing. Is
that the best you could come up with?

01:31:01.253 --> 01:31:02.379
Lame.

01:31:02.379 --> 01:31:05.215
What do you mean?

01:31:05.382 --> 01:31:09.219
