00:19.000 --> 00:22.400
Sorry I haven't changed, sir.
The message said it was urgent.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.400
Hello again, Major Carter.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.280
Warrick.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.720
- It's good to see you again.
- You too. What brings you here?

00:31.800 --> 00:36.280
When last we spoke, you reiterated your
desire for access to Serrakin technology.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.800
Yes, of course.

00:37.880 --> 00:43.160
Yet diplomacy between our respective
leadership has been slow to develop.

00:43.240 --> 00:48.000
- I'm sure they're just being cautious.
- As I told Hammond and Dr Jackson,

00:48.080 --> 00:52.360
<i>I am here to offer you full access to
the ion propulsion engine on the Seberus.</i>

00:52.440 --> 00:54.240
Well, that's great.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.920
- Sir, this could...
- I read your report, Major.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.400
I won't debate the value of the technology,
but there's more.

01:03.040 --> 01:06.120
In return, I would like your help...

01:06.200 --> 01:08.600
to win a race.

02:11.039 --> 02:14.160
It is called the Loop of Kon Garat.

02:14.240 --> 02:18.200
Every year, the largest corporation
on my planet, known as Tech Con Group,

02:18.280 --> 02:22.960
awards an extremely lucrative contract
to the winner of the Loop.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.680
<i>(Daniel) A contract?</i>

02:25.760 --> 02:30.520
It is a time-tested method to find the most
able pilot with the best ship for the job.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.200
The race is open to anyone.
There are few rules.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.160
The winner's ship
must arrive first and intact.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.560
The government of your planet is letting
you share advanced technology with us

02:40.640 --> 02:44.240
in exchange for us
helping you to win a race?

02:45.480 --> 02:47.280
Not exactly.

02:47.360 --> 02:51.840
I have arranged for a small group of you
to come to Hebridan on a diplomatic visit.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.800
There is no rule
preventing you from helping me,

02:54.880 --> 02:57.160
and what you learn while you're there...

02:57.240 --> 02:59.920
So, unofficially.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.640
- How can we help?
- Major!

03:03.720 --> 03:06.720
Can't hurt to ask, can it, sir?

03:08.920 --> 03:12.200
<i>The power you used to recharge
the Seberus when I was stranded...</i>

03:12.280 --> 03:16.200
<i>- A naqahdah generator.
- The Seberus has been through a lot.</i>

03:16.280 --> 03:20.440
But my diagnostic analysis of its systems
showed greatly improved efficiency

03:20.520 --> 03:23.120
when supplemented
by the naqahdah generator.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.280
I'd like to participate.

03:27.800 --> 03:31.640
Well, actually,
I was not asking you to join me.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.400
Why not? I'll have to
interface the generator.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.960
Could you not just show me?

03:37.040 --> 03:41.160
Naqahdah generators are valuable to us.
We won't let one out of our sight.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.440
Besides, you never know
what issues could arise on the fly.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.280
I feel compelled to warn you of
the danger. It's not for the fainthearted.

03:48.360 --> 03:52.080
We take risks to attain
advanced technology all the time.

03:52.160 --> 03:57.840
For me, there'd be no better way to learn
about your ship than to see it in action.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.200
A victory would mean a great deal to me.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.280
I am not above accepting your offer.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.720
With your approval, sir.

04:08.480 --> 04:13.000
Major, I expect you to evaluate the risk
of this mission on an ongoing basis

04:13.080 --> 04:16.480
- and act accordingly.
- As always, sir.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.840
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.720
- You ready?
- Yeah, just about.

04:27.800 --> 04:33.000
Warrick has set us up some meetings with
high-ranking members of his government.

04:33.080 --> 04:37.560
- I bet O'Neill's looking forward to that.
- Oh, yeah.

04:37.640 --> 04:41.440
- You really think this is worth it?
- Absolutely.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.400
Why, don't you?

04:43.480 --> 04:45.360
No... Yeah... I just...

04:45.440 --> 04:49.400
- You just seem unusually gung ho.
- Gung ho?

04:49.480 --> 04:52.880
This is more than about
attaining new technology for you.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.160
You mean helping Warrick?
He did once risk his life for me.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.240
Yeah, I heard that.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.360
I think there's something else.

05:00.440 --> 05:04.960
Look, I know that
this could be dangerous,

05:05.040 --> 05:08.240
but this is our job, right?
It's what we signed on to do.

05:08.320 --> 05:12.960
We take risks in the hopes of
achieving new levels of technology.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.080
If - and I stress "if" -

05:16.160 --> 05:21.080
participating in this race
happens to be a little bit, I don't know...

05:21.160 --> 05:22.840
Fun?

05:22.920 --> 05:27.800
- What's a girl to do?
- Nothing. That's just what I thought.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.720
<i>I'm Ardal Hadraig.</i>

05:34.800 --> 05:40.600
<i>Welcome back to TCNN's exclusive
coverage of the 59th Loop of Kon Garat.</i>

05:40.680 --> 05:42.880
<i>With the Loop set to begin tomorrow,</i>

05:42.960 --> 05:46.400
<i>we have a startling
new development to report.</i>

05:46.480 --> 05:49.400
<i>Perennial also-ran Warrick Finn
announced today</i>

05:49.480 --> 05:54.040
<i>that his copilot will be a human from
the planet we've come to know as Earth.</i>

05:54.120 --> 06:00.440
<i>Major Carter's participation will mark the
first inclusion of an alien in Loop history.</i>

06:00.520 --> 06:03.240
<i>A band of explorers happened upon him</i>

06:03.320 --> 06:07.080
<i>when his ship, the "Seberus",
crashed on an uncharted planet</i>

06:07.160 --> 06:10.400
<i>while transporting convicts
to the outlying prison colonies.</i>

06:10.480 --> 06:12.960
<i>The question on everyone's mind is</i>

06:13.040 --> 06:17.280
<i>will these earthlings bring Warrick luck
a second time around?</i>

06:18.240 --> 06:21.160
<i>Continuing coverage
of the Loop of Kon Garat</i>

06:21.240 --> 06:24.720
<i>is brought to you
by Tech Con Ultra Sport Beverage.</i>

06:24.800 --> 06:31.400
<i>When you've got an ultrabig thirst to
quench, only Tech Con Ultra Sport will do.</i>

06:39.080 --> 06:41.720
May I introduce you all to Eamon?

06:41.800 --> 06:45.040
<i>He is responsible for making
the Seberus what it is today.</i>

06:45.120 --> 06:47.640
And he is my younger brother.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.360
Ah, yes. I see the family resemblance.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.680
It's uncanny, boys.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.360
It's like...

06:57.720 --> 07:02.040
- Colonel Jack O'Neill. This is...
- You just had to do it, didn't you?

07:02.120 --> 07:03.360
Eamon...

07:03.440 --> 07:07.960
- You think we'd lose without their help?
- Eamon!

07:08.040 --> 07:12.080
They saved my life and are responsible
for my getting back home to Hebridan.

07:12.160 --> 07:16.560
- I suggest you show some respect.
- My apologies.

07:16.640 --> 07:20.000
I am honoured to meet
my brother's saviours.

07:20.080 --> 07:25.640
And you must be Major Carter. The one
without whom we could not win the Loop.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.560
You know, I feel all warm and fuzzy.
How about you?

07:28.640 --> 07:33.480
Major Carter, if you are to be my copilot,
you'll need to know how the ship works.

07:33.560 --> 07:36.680
<i>- What is this?
- The operations manual for the Seberus.</i>

07:36.760 --> 07:40.160
- I had it translated for you.
- Thank you.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.640
That's not our language.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.760
It's mine, sir.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.840
Right.

07:47.720 --> 07:51.280
The long-range scanner control unit
didn't come in again today.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.840
- When I called, they said our credit...
- I will go and pick one up,

07:54.920 --> 08:00.320
after I escort Colonel O'Neill, Dr Jackson
and Teal'c to our capitol building.

08:00.400 --> 08:05.760
- T, you coming?
- Carter requested I remain to assist her.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.560
- She did?
- I did?

08:11.160 --> 08:12.760
Indeed.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.600
Right. Yes, thank you.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.080
I do not wish to disappoint Major Carter.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.960
Yes, I know the feeling.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.480
- Shall we?
- Stay in touch.

08:33.159 --> 08:36.520
- I am in your debt, Major Carter.
- Indeed.

08:43.480 --> 08:48.080
With all your science, I'm surprised you
don't have a power source that rivals this.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.920
Oh, they exist.
We just couldn't afford one.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.800
Ah.

08:55.280 --> 08:59.040
- Warrick is desperate, Major.
- How do you mean?

08:59.120 --> 09:02.280
He was gone a long time.
We all thought he was dead.

09:02.360 --> 09:06.920
His wife, Athea, remarried,
and has children of her own now.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.880
Since his return, work has been scarce.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.080
He thinks this race
is his chance to get his life back,

09:15.160 --> 09:18.160
and he will do anything to win it.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.240
- What about you?
- Me?

09:21.320 --> 09:23.120
I work for Tech Con.

09:23.200 --> 09:27.560
I design garbage disposal units
for their food service division.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.880
Need I say more?

09:30.760 --> 09:34.000
<i>- No.
- (Warrick) Eamon, I'm back.</i>

09:34.080 --> 09:38.160
<i>- Did you get the...
- No. They just transmitted the race data.</i>

09:44.760 --> 09:50.200
<i>(announcer) Tech Con Group - progress
and people working in total harmony.</i>

09:50.280 --> 09:54.000
<i>I'm Miles Hagan,
President of Tech Con Group.</i>

09:54.080 --> 09:58.440
<i>I wish to welcome you as an official
contestant to the Loop of Kon Garat.</i>

09:58.520 --> 10:01.320
<i>Congratulations on qualifying.</i>

10:02.160 --> 10:07.720
<i>As always, the Loop will run through
a course that consists of four stages.</i>

10:07.800 --> 10:12.640
<i>- Defence...
- We know that. Skip to the competition.</i>

10:12.720 --> 10:13.920
<i>(fast-forwards tape)</i>

10:14.000 --> 10:17.400
<i>Let's meet your fellow pilots, shall we?</i>

10:20.920 --> 10:23.480
I don't believe it. Jarlath.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.880
Jarlath?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.760
I know him from my days
of transporting convicts.

10:30.840 --> 10:35.600
He was caught running illegal weapons.
I thought he was in prison.

10:35.680 --> 10:41.040
- Looks like he's been paroled.
- He's not our biggest problem.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.960
La'el Montrose, independent cargo runner
from the Parallel Colonies.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.720
Her ship is very fast.
And worse still...

10:52.440 --> 10:56.280
- Hm. Muirios.
- His skill as a pilot is legendary.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.320
- Can we beat him?
- You'll lose in the navigation phase

10:59.400 --> 11:02.200
without a long-range scanner control unit.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.680
I will get one.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.040
What's this?

11:24.200 --> 11:26.200
Expensive.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.200
Hello, Warrick. Who's your friend?

11:30.280 --> 11:32.880
Hi. Major Samantha Carter.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.120
Ah, one of the earthlings.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.440
I heard about you.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.440
We're here for the scanner control unit.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.680
- Look, Warrick...
- Taupen.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.200
I'm running a business, not a charity.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.160
Your credit's been over
the maximum for months.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.920
The best chance of my paying you back
is for me to win.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.640
I'm sorry, Warrick. I can't give you
a new one, but you're in luck.

11:55.720 --> 12:00.200
I just picked up this
reconditioned unit this morning.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.280
It should work fine.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.800
I will take it. Thank you.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.840
<i>- I promise. I will settle up things after...
- (man) After you lose.</i>

12:12.400 --> 12:15.720
You don't think he's good for it, do you?

12:15.800 --> 12:19.920
He doesn't stand a chance
of winning the Loop.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.840
Jarlath.

12:21.920 --> 12:25.320
Still avoiding personal hygiene, I see.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.400
Who's your friend, Warrick?

12:28.480 --> 12:30.680
She looks nice.

12:32.040 --> 12:38.400
<i>Golon Jarlath, Captain of the Oran,
very much at your service.</i>

12:38.480 --> 12:40.480
lgnore him, Major.

12:43.080 --> 12:48.720
Stay out of my way, Warrick,
or I'll blow your pathetic ship to pieces.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.960
Warrick.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.120
You're right. He is not worth it.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.680
That's it. We're done.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.760
She's ready.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.000
<i>(Teal'c) Do you believe
the Seberus can win this race?</i>

13:14.080 --> 13:19.640
I'd like to think we'd have won without
the naqahdah. With it, I'd guarantee it.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.520
Hungry?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.880
That depends.

13:23.960 --> 13:28.040
I'm sure we can find something
that will suit you.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.240
<i>With the Loop set to begin
only minutes from now,</i>

13:55.320 --> 13:59.800
<i>I'm joined by race expert
and two-time champion Coyle Boron.</i>

13:59.880 --> 14:02.960
<i>Coyle, what's going through
the pilots' minds right now?</i>

14:03.040 --> 14:07.400
<i>Well, at the starting buoys there's nothing
else to do but run your preflight check</i>

14:07.480 --> 14:10.520
<i>and hope all your hard work pays off.
It's a tense time.</i>

14:10.600 --> 14:13.080
<i>There's no question the stakes are high.</i>

14:13.160 --> 14:15.640
<i>The winner receives
a lucrative contract</i>

14:15.720 --> 14:18.440
<i>with Tech Con's
deep-space-exploration project,</i>

14:18.520 --> 14:23.800
<i>while anything else means massive debt
and the acrid taste of bitter defeat.</i>

14:23.880 --> 14:27.720
<i>It's an interesting group of pilots this year,
Coyle. Who do you like?</i>

14:27.800 --> 14:30.040
<i>You gotta like this kid Muirios.</i>

14:30.120 --> 14:33.160
<i>He's got the talent
and the ship to take it all.</i>

14:33.240 --> 14:37.440
<i>What about Warrick and the human
woman? Any potential for an upset?</i>

14:37.520 --> 14:39.960
<i>They don't stand a chance.</i>

14:40.040 --> 14:43.920
<i>Well, the gaming experts agree.
You can wager on the outcome</i>

14:44.000 --> 14:46.800
<i>at any of Tech Con Group's
friendly gaming kiosks,</i>

14:46.880 --> 14:50.000
<i>conveniently located
throughout urban centres near you.</i>

14:50.080 --> 14:54.920
<i>Tech Con Gaming Kiosks -
if you don't play, you definitely won't win.</i>

14:56.880 --> 15:01.080
I'm getting the feeling that even
a long look at an ion drive isn't enough.

15:01.160 --> 15:06.640
We'll need a compression coil to have any
chance of reproducing the technology.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.000
If we win, I'll buy you one.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.000
<i>If we win?</i>

15:11.080 --> 15:15.600
<i>(Flight Control) Prepare for race start.
All pilots check in now.</i>

15:15.680 --> 15:20.960
<i>Flight Control, this is the Seberus,
preparing for race start.</i>

15:23.120 --> 15:27.480
<i>- What do you want, Jarlath?
- Just to tell you to drop out now</i>

15:27.560 --> 15:33.400
<i>and save that worthless junk barge you
call a ship from being destroyed. (laughs)</i>

15:33.480 --> 15:37.680
<i>- Eat greeven, Jarlath.
- You piece of...</i>

15:37.760 --> 15:40.680
- Greeven?
- Don't ask.

15:40.760 --> 15:45.800
<i>This is Tech Con Flight Control.
Stand by for race start.</i>

15:45.880 --> 15:47.840
Ready or not,

15:47.920 --> 15:50.680
here... we... go.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.080
The first stage is a test
of each ship's defence capabilities.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.760
Against what?

16:15.320 --> 16:18.400
- Those things are firing at us.
- Yes.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.480
Bring aft shields to full.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.480
- That is auxiliary power.
- Right.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.680
<i>- Shields are holding.
- Captain Shibo of the "Tritan".</i>

16:40.760 --> 16:43.440
<i>Losing shield power.
Key systems are failing.</i>

16:43.520 --> 16:45.720
<i>Tritan, this is Warrick on the Seberus.</i>

16:45.800 --> 16:49.800
Siphon primary power from your regulator
and boost your shield strength.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.080
<i>I can't. I've lost my interchange unit.</i>

16:52.160 --> 16:53.600
<i>I...</i>

16:53.680 --> 16:56.200
<i>Tritan, hold on.
We're on our way to assist.</i>

17:00.480 --> 17:04.280
<i>Too late. My engines are fried.
I'm out, Warrick. Thanks anyway.</i>

17:04.359 --> 17:08.319
- Is he gonna be OK?
- Drones cease firing if a ship is disabled.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.359
That's it, we're clear.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.680
Anyone ever die in this race?

17:22.760 --> 17:25.520
- I told you it was dangerous.
- I know.

17:25.599 --> 17:29.360
Are there no events such as this on Earth
where humans risk their lives?

17:29.440 --> 17:33.360
- Yeah, a few.
- No matter how much winning may mean,

17:33.440 --> 17:36.520
I'd never intentionally
endanger your life. This ship...

17:36.600 --> 17:38.280
<i>(alarm)</i>

17:38.360 --> 17:41.120
- What now? I thought we were clear.
- Stage two.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.800
We're entering
the coronasphere of our sun.

17:43.880 --> 17:48.360
It disturbs the communication
and navigation equipment.

17:48.440 --> 17:52.640
Eamon has designed shielding
specifically for this phase.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.680
<i>And so, after stage one,
Muirios has the lead,</i>

17:56.760 --> 18:00.640
<i>followed closely by
La'el Montrose and Golon Jarlath.</i>

18:00.720 --> 18:03.160
<i>The "Oran" made quick work
of those drones.</i>

18:03.240 --> 18:07.040
<i>- We've got stage two coming up fast.
- That would be the coronasphere.</i>

18:07.120 --> 18:11.760
<i>It's made up of ionised gases, so you
fly though a layer of translucent plasma.</i>

18:11.840 --> 18:16.560
<i>- Wow. Sounds hot.
- At this stage it's all about the shields.</i>

18:16.640 --> 18:20.040
<i>Does your ship have what it takes
to survive that intense heat?</i>

18:20.120 --> 18:22.920
<i>- And if it doesn't?
- You'd be instantly vaporised.</i>

18:23.000 --> 18:26.200
<i>Interesting. In a horrifying sense!</i>

18:26.280 --> 18:29.600
<i>If you have a loved one
who's close to death, don't delay.</i>

18:29.680 --> 18:32.520
<i>Contact Tech Con Group
Funeral Services today</i>

18:32.600 --> 18:35.720
<i>and make your loved one's farewell
memorable beyond words.</i>

18:35.800 --> 18:40.320
<i>Tech Con Group Funeral Services -
helping you make peace with death.</i>

18:47.320 --> 18:52.360
- Initiating coronaspheric shielding.
- Communication systems are inoperative.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.240
They will come back.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.600
<i>(alarm)</i>

18:59.080 --> 19:01.320
- What's going on?
- I do not know.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.080
We are losing engine power.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.480
Teal'c, Eamon.

19:06.560 --> 19:12.720
<i>We are sending a distress signal.
Our key systems are inoperative.</i>

19:12.800 --> 19:15.560
<i>- Engines are failing.
- How does one respond?</i>

19:15.640 --> 19:17.760
Here.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.640
<i>- Major Carter, come in.
- We can no longer maintain...</i>

19:20.720 --> 19:22.720
<i>(static)</i>

19:22.800 --> 19:25.520
They've lost all primary power.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.840
They're in trouble.

19:29.640 --> 19:34.320
Auxiliary power will not engage.
We are on emergency storage cells.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.560
- What are you doing?
- The blast shields will block the radiation.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.640
So much for not risking your life.

19:52.440 --> 19:56.720
- What happened?
- The power diverter overloaded.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.280
- Can you fix it?
- No.

19:59.360 --> 20:03.200
<i>(Teal'c) Major Carter, Captain Warrick,
do you read me?</i>

20:03.280 --> 20:06.240
- We're here. Can you hear us?
- Are you all right?

20:06.320 --> 20:08.480
<i>The power diverter overloaded.</i>

20:08.560 --> 20:12.240
Impossible. I ran a full diagnostic
three hours before the race.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.640
Unless...

20:13.720 --> 20:15.520
Unless what?

20:17.200 --> 20:21.720
It's hard to tell with all the damage, but
if someone cut the link to the system...

20:21.800 --> 20:25.880
- Somebody did this on purpose?
- They'd need knowledge of the systems.

20:25.960 --> 20:30.120
I think they knew exactly where to hit us
and how to cover their tracks.

20:30.200 --> 20:34.080
- Eamon, we're being pulled to the sun.
- I know.

20:35.400 --> 20:41.120
Bypass the diverter and manually regulate
power to the engines with the accelerator.

20:42.200 --> 20:47.520
- It's dangerous.
- More dangerous than flying into a sun?

20:47.600 --> 20:51.840
We have to reconnect the naqahdah
generator in order to bypass the diverter

20:51.920 --> 20:54.680
and supply power directly to the engines.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.520
- How much time do we have?
- Not much.

21:02.320 --> 21:06.360
<i>And so, out of the ten ships
that started the Loop, only six remain.</i>

21:06.440 --> 21:09.080
<i>And that number
may soon dwindle to five.</i>

21:09.160 --> 21:13.920
<i>For those of you just joining us, all
I can say is where have you been hiding?</i>

21:14.000 --> 21:18.160
<i>Warrick Finn and his alien copilot
have slipped back into last place.</i>

21:18.240 --> 21:21.800
<i>- They ran into trouble during stage two.
- That's right, Ardal.</i>

21:21.880 --> 21:24.960
<i>Latest updates place them
dangerously close to the sun.</i>

21:25.040 --> 21:28.920
<i>Warrick must be disappointed to be
facing certain defeat so early in the race.</i>

21:29.000 --> 21:32.920
<i>You got that right. This is the moment
where every pilot has to dig deep</i>

21:33.000 --> 21:37.200
<i>in that reservoir of desire and fortitude
if they want to win.</i>

21:37.280 --> 21:42.240
<i>It sounds like maybe they could use
a couple of bottles of Radon Shield 55,</i>

21:42.320 --> 21:44.160
<i>new from Tech Con Cosmetics.</i>

21:44.240 --> 21:49.040
<i>Radon Shield 55 protects you and your
whole family from the sun's radiation.</i>

21:49.120 --> 21:55.120
<i>Day in, day out, Radon Shield 55 keeps
your fun factor up and lesion count down.</i>

21:55.200 --> 21:59.200
<i>Available at quality Tech Con
family outlets everywhere.</i>

22:04.920 --> 22:08.720
Someone must have snuck in here,
got into the ship.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.320
- Who would know the ship well enough?
- No one.

22:11.400 --> 22:15.600
<i>The Seberus is a common model,
but I've customised it significantly.</i>

22:15.680 --> 22:19.880
Unless someone accessed the schematics
on my computer at Tech Con.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.040
I'm done.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.880
Me too.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.560
- Let's hope this works.
- If it doesn't?

22:35.640 --> 22:39.440
We fall into the sun and burn up,
or worse.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.160
- Worse?
- We could explode right now.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.400
Oh.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.320
Here goes.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.560
Let's get out of here.

22:57.320 --> 23:00.440
<i>(Carter) Teal'c, we've got
the power back online.</i>

23:00.520 --> 23:03.400
That is good to hear, Major Carter.

23:05.640 --> 23:08.200
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

23:08.280 --> 23:12.720
- Someone did access my computer.
- Who?

23:12.800 --> 23:16.200
His name is Del Tynan.
He's my supervisor.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.360
I can't tell exactly what he got.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.840
If we're gonna prove anything,
we need to go to Tech Con.

23:21.920 --> 23:26.720
They won't let you in without clearance.
You'll need a hat.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.440
Three more ships have pulled out,
and we've fallen far behind the others.

23:31.520 --> 23:35.360
If you wish we can drop out now
and avoid any further risk.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.680
<i>Carter?. You there?</i>

23:42.760 --> 23:44.440
Colonel, sir.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.200
<i>I got it to work.
How's it going up there?</i>

23:47.280 --> 23:49.560
We had some trouble, but we're fine now.

23:49.640 --> 23:52.760
<i>- You sure?
- Yeah. How's it going down there?</i>

23:52.840 --> 23:56.440
<i>Uh, good. We're gonna
help them bring a Stargate here.</i>

23:56.520 --> 23:59.600
<i>In exchange, we get an ion drive to study.</i>

23:59.680 --> 24:04.280
<i>- Really?
- Yes. So no need to take any chances.</i>

24:05.400 --> 24:07.440
I made a deal. I'm sticking with it.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.760
<i>Oh, having fun are we, Carter?.</i>

24:13.800 --> 24:16.920
Um, gotta go.
We're pretty far behind at this point.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.520
<i>All right. Be careful.</i>

24:19.600 --> 24:22.800
<i>- We will. Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

24:28.360 --> 24:32.920
OK. If we use the gravity of the sun to
slingshot us around back onto the course,

24:33.000 --> 24:36.200
we could pick up enough speed
to get back into the race.

24:36.280 --> 24:37.680
Brilliant.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.400
- Hi, Eamon.
- Hello.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.920
This is my cousin...

24:58.000 --> 25:00.200
- Murray.
- Mm. Twice removed.

25:00.280 --> 25:03.000
I just forgot a data unit in my office.
Won't be long.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.080
You have to scan in. Company policy.

25:10.600 --> 25:14.800
- Sorry your brother isn't doing very well.
- Oh, me too.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.280
Nice to meet you, Murray.

25:25.680 --> 25:29.480
- This is Tynan's office.
- Does he not keep his office secure?

25:29.560 --> 25:33.760
The company philosophy
encourages mutual trust.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.640
Besides, no one is
going to steal his plants.

25:41.920 --> 25:46.520
Everything of value is in here. The system
is protected by a secret pass code.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.840
Fortunately,
I put a program on my system

25:48.920 --> 25:53.080
that records an intruder's pass code
if someone attempts to access my files.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.880
Then it is good you do not subscribe
to the company philosophy.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.840
Mm.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.720
<i>(beeping)</i>

26:05.480 --> 26:09.120
<i>(computer) This is an automated
distress signal. The following pilot:</i>

26:09.200 --> 26:11.760
<i>- (Jarlath) Jarlath.
- ..is in need of assistance.</i>

26:11.840 --> 26:13.640
<i>Current status is:</i>

26:13.720 --> 26:17.400
<i>(Jarlath) Die, you rotting scrap of jetsam!</i>

26:22.520 --> 26:27.000
This is worse than I thought. He has
schematics for every ship in the race.

26:27.080 --> 26:30.200
For the purpose of
sabotaging the competition.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.640
But not this one.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.000
It has boosters from
Tech Con's prototype division.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.480
A private-sector pilot could not buy these.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.560
- To whom does that ship belong?
- Muirios.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.640
Tynan has set him up to win.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.920
We have to warn Warrick.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.440
I don't think so.

27:04.040 --> 27:09.600
<i>Oran, this is the Seberus responding to
your distress call. Jarlath, do you read?</i>

27:09.680 --> 27:13.320
<i>- Warrick?
- We're close by. What is your status?</i>

27:13.400 --> 27:17.000
<i>My status is mind your own business.</i>

27:18.080 --> 27:23.160
<i>- You sent out a distress call.
- No, my computer did. Everything is fine.</i>

27:23.240 --> 27:26.520
Transmission indicates
your life support is failing.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.600
<i>My oxygen supply vented.</i>

27:28.680 --> 27:32.600
That is what you get for having no shields.
The drones must have caused a leak.

27:32.680 --> 27:36.200
<i>Shut up, Warrick.
Go back to losing the race.</i>

27:38.320 --> 27:40.400
You'll die if you don't let us help.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.880
<i>I don't need help, least of all from you.</i>

27:42.960 --> 27:45.600
What about emergency reserves?

27:45.680 --> 27:49.240
<i>I don't have any.
I needed the room for additional weapons.</i>

27:49.320 --> 27:51.120
Imbecile.

27:51.200 --> 27:56.760
<i>I would rather die kissing space debris
than board that barge you call a ship.</i>

27:59.200 --> 28:02.240
He does not want to be rescued.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.440
Jarlath, hold on. We'll be there soon.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.800
I am not coming up there.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.880
We tried.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.080
Come on!

28:41.160 --> 28:43.160
<i>(grumbles)</i>

28:50.080 --> 28:53.000
Can you move any slower?

28:53.080 --> 28:55.560
You don't think you can still win, do you?

28:55.640 --> 28:59.280
We are only this far behind
because we were sabotaged.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
A likely excuse.

29:05.920 --> 29:09.320
- So was l, by the way.
- How so?

29:09.400 --> 29:13.080
The drones didn't cause the leak
in my life support. I was never hit.

29:13.160 --> 29:17.240
- Somebody fixed the whole race?
- It is not over yet.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.440
What planet do you live on?

29:20.840 --> 29:24.040
Told you we should have left him to die.

29:25.240 --> 29:30.160
<i>(O'Neill) Teal'c, do you read?
Teal'c, you still at Tech Con?</i>

29:33.440 --> 29:36.680
This is unfortunate.
You were a good employee, Eamon.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.920
- How could you do this?
- How could l?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.120
How could I not?

29:42.200 --> 29:47.320
Your new friend here doesn't want you
to know the Serrakin are not to be trusted.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.200
The Serrakin freed your ancestors
from the Goa'uld.

29:50.280 --> 29:55.200
For what purpose, hm?
Sharing technology? Living in harmony?

29:55.280 --> 29:56.880
All lies.

29:56.960 --> 30:00.560
The Serrakin are seizing control
of our world, piece by piece,

30:00.640 --> 30:04.000
taking power and opportunity away
from pureblood humans,

30:04.080 --> 30:08.640
polluting our race by crossbreeding,
weakening it, by design.

30:08.720 --> 30:12.360
Don't you see? The Serrakin
are no better than the Goa'uld.

30:12.440 --> 30:18.720
This is insane. Our society was built by
both races, for the good of all Hebridians.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.800
Is that why Serrakin
hold all the highest positions

30:21.880 --> 30:24.320
and humans are like
second-class citizens?

30:24.400 --> 30:26.400
That's not true!

30:27.320 --> 30:28.720
When Hagan finds out...

30:28.800 --> 30:33.680
Hagan is one of the primary architects
of human oppression on this planet.

30:33.760 --> 30:39.040
The winner of the Loop will be a pure
human. And that's merely the first step.

30:39.120 --> 30:44.280
You're just mad because you've been
passed over for advancement three times.

30:44.360 --> 30:48.360
You think I'm the only one? There are
enough of us to make a difference.

30:48.440 --> 30:52.760
Has it occurred to you maybe the reason
you've been passed over so many times

30:52.840 --> 30:57.480
is not because you're a human,
but because you're a moron?

31:00.160 --> 31:04.960
I am doing this to save my kind
from the likes of you.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.080
I guess not.

31:18.960 --> 31:25.240
<i>Welcome back to TCNN's continuing
coverage of the Loop of Kon Garat.</i>

31:25.320 --> 31:27.560
<i>We have startling developments.</i>

31:27.640 --> 31:32.640
<i>Warrick and Samantha Carter have
re-entered the race with a vengeance,</i>

31:32.720 --> 31:35.280
<i>and are now pulling into
a close third position.</i>

31:35.360 --> 31:39.880
<i>- What does this mean for Muirios?
- He's had a commanding lead throughout.</i>

31:39.960 --> 31:44.520
<i>He's gotta be wondering what Warrick has
that let him make up that distance so fast.</i>

31:44.600 --> 31:48.600
<i>Well, Coyle, perhaps he's using Ion Pro,
a new engine additive</i>

31:48.680 --> 31:51.280
<i>- from Tech Con Propulsion Systems.
- Perhaps.</i>

31:51.360 --> 31:56.240
<i>Ion Pro is guaranteed to improve drive
performance, whatever class ship you fly.</i>

31:56.320 --> 32:00.480
<i>Whether you're competing in the Loop
of Kon Garat or taking the kids to school,</i>

32:00.560 --> 32:02.840
<i>use Ion Pro in your power source.</i>

32:02.920 --> 32:05.680
<i>Ion Pro from
Tech Con Propulsion Systems,</i>

32:05.760 --> 32:09.120
<i>your systemwide experts
in ion-drive technology.</i>

32:09.200 --> 32:14.160
- I can't let you inside without clearance.
- We're looking for people in the building.

32:14.240 --> 32:16.560
If you give me their names, I'll check.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.240
- OK. One of them is named...
- Eamon.

32:19.320 --> 32:20.920
Eamon.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.440
- And his cousin Murray?
- Murray! Yes, that's them.

32:24.520 --> 32:27.040
- Yes, they're here.
- Can we come inside now?

32:27.120 --> 32:28.720
No.

32:30.280 --> 32:33.360
All right, here's what I'd like you to do.

32:33.440 --> 32:36.360
Pick up that phone,
call Mr Whoever-Runs-This-Place.

32:36.440 --> 32:38.800
- Hagan.
- I'm sorry, but I just can't...

32:38.880 --> 32:40.680
We're old friends.

32:40.760 --> 32:45.480
Tell him Mr Man-Who-Has-The-Stargate
is here to see him. He'll understand.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.560
Stargate.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.600
Go ahead.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.680
Buttons. Phone.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.240
Mr Hagan, please.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.640
Nice.

33:01.680 --> 33:07.880
What are you going to do, Tynan?
He's an alien. His people will miss him.

33:08.640 --> 33:11.840
<i>- Tynan, respond.
- What is it, Muirios?</i>

33:11.920 --> 33:17.920
<i>It's the "Seberus". Warrick is still in
the race and he's gaining on my position.</i>

33:26.400 --> 33:28.280
Hard left!

33:33.160 --> 33:35.360
What was that?

33:36.880 --> 33:40.720
- You said left!
- Oh, did l? Sorry.

33:40.800 --> 33:44.360
This is a waste of time.
We don't have a chance.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.760
<i>- You're gonna get us killed.
- (both) Shut up!</i>

33:58.120 --> 34:02.520
<i>How did this happen? You said the
"Seberus" would be disabled and I'd win.</i>

34:02.600 --> 34:06.200
You will win, Muirios.
Just focus on what you have to do.

34:06.280 --> 34:09.199
<i>I'll take care of the Seberus.</i>

34:12.159 --> 34:13.760
<i>Tynan calling the Seberus.</i>

34:14.239 --> 34:17.199
<i>- I know you can hear me.
- What do you want, Tynan?</i>

34:17.280 --> 34:22.800
I only intended to disable your ship, but
your stubbornness has forced my hand.

34:22.880 --> 34:25.760
<i>I have your brother
and one of the visitors from Earth,</i>

34:25.840 --> 34:29.400
so drop out of the race. Now.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.920
Dr Jackson.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.680
Colonel O'Neill.

34:58.760 --> 35:02.560
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
What can I do for you?

35:02.640 --> 35:07.640
We think a member of our group might
somehow be lost inside your building

35:07.720 --> 35:09.760
with one of your employees.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.600
Lost? That seems unlikely.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.240
Well, you gotta know the guy.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.680
Of course. Come with me.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.560
We were gaining on them.
We had a chance.

35:29.640 --> 35:34.600
You'll let a little thing like your brother's
life stop you from winning the race?

35:34.680 --> 35:36.680
<i>(both) Shut up.</i>

35:46.960 --> 35:49.520
Muirios, La'el Montrose is gaining on you.

35:49.600 --> 35:54.120
<i>- You were supposed to take care of her.
- She must have overcome the problem.</i>

35:54.200 --> 35:56.080
<i>- Lose her.
- I'm trying.</i>

35:56.160 --> 35:59.600
Try harder. Do whatever you have to.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.440
Get rid of them. Take them away.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.960
Hello, Del.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.040
Mr Hagan.

36:16.520 --> 36:19.160
Nice outfit. You guys OK?

36:19.240 --> 36:20.440
Indeed.

36:20.520 --> 36:25.320
How many times have I told you,
don't get caught by the bad guys?

36:25.400 --> 36:26.960
How could you do this, Del?

36:27.040 --> 36:31.920
He says he was defending his people from
a Serrakin conspiracy to enslave humans.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.760
I did what I had to.
Your kind are a disease.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.840
The only disease here is greed.

36:37.920 --> 36:42.440
He was protecting the deal he made with
Muirios, which I suspect was lucrative.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.360
The reason you've been
passed over for advancement

36:45.440 --> 36:49.320
is because you've been under
investigation for corruption for a year.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.280
We couldn't prove anything, until now.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.480
I intend to file a protest
with the Employment Council.

36:55.560 --> 37:00.160
Employment is the least
of your worries right now, Del.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.680
Warrick, Major Carter, it's Eamon.
Are you there?

37:04.760 --> 37:08.120
<i>- Eamon, are you all right?
- Teal'c and I are safe.</i>

37:08.200 --> 37:11.240
Now get back in the race and win.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.120
If you can.

37:22.400 --> 37:26.080
- You must be out of your mind!
- Do not say a word.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.880
Major, give me all you've got.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.760
Max power.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.960
I hate to say it, but Jarlath might be right.

37:36.040 --> 37:40.120
Muirios has too big a lead.
We'll never catch him.

37:42.520 --> 37:46.120
He cheated. I can't believe
they'll still let him take first prize.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.560
Unless we can keep Muirios
from crossing the finish line first.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.960
- How can we do that?
- That's easy.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.640
Just get me close.

38:02.560 --> 38:06.400
The closest we will get is when they
double back past us after the final turn.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.480
It'll have to do.

38:09.960 --> 38:14.360
- What are you doing?
- Rerouting the conduit from your device

38:14.440 --> 38:17.400
and doubling it back
through the communications array.

38:17.480 --> 38:21.080
- Why? So we can ask him to lose?
- Humorous.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.200
More like tell him.

38:23.280 --> 38:27.280
This will allow us
to send a blast transmission.

38:28.760 --> 38:35.320
If my aim is correct, it'll temporarily freeze
the command controls on Muirios's ship.

38:35.400 --> 38:39.400
- You are even crazier than I thought.
- Never was much of a pilot.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.480
But weapons?

38:41.560 --> 38:43.560
It's an art.

38:45.440 --> 38:48.320
They're coming around the final turn.

38:57.920 --> 39:02.480
- He's trying to take out La'el's ship.
- I don't think so.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.200
Well done.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.080
Ah, don't make me sick.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.520
<i>Unbelievable! What a finish!</i>

39:21.600 --> 39:25.080
<i>La'el Montrose has won
the Loop of Kon Garat!</i>

39:25.160 --> 39:28.880
<i>- What happened to Muirios?
- It was his race to lose, and he lost it.</i>

39:28.960 --> 39:31.800
<i>Some kind of beam weapon
caused his ship's power to fail.</i>

39:31.880 --> 39:34.720
<i>Opening the door
for La'el Montrose to take it all.</i>

39:34.800 --> 39:37.560
<i>You have got to love
there are no rules in this race.</i>

39:37.640 --> 39:40.040
<i>It's what makes
this competition so special.</i>

39:40.120 --> 39:42.440
<i>I must say,
I haven't seen anything like it.</i>

39:42.520 --> 39:46.400
<i>You must be particularly surprised,
since you picked Muirios to win.</i>

39:46.480 --> 39:48.280
<i>Yes, I was wrong about that.</i>

39:48.360 --> 39:51.080
<i>You also said Warrick
wouldn't be in contention,</i>

39:51.160 --> 39:53.840
<i>and yet he came very close
to finishing this race.</i>

39:53.920 --> 39:57.120
<i>- I was wrong about that too.
- Predictions for next year?.</i>

39:57.200 --> 39:59.200
<i>Well, I'd rather not say!</i>

39:59.280 --> 40:05.960
<i>Back with interviews after a word from
our sponsor, Corso's Temporal Eatery,</i>

40:06.040 --> 40:09.800
<i>where your whole family can eat
what they want, when they want.</i>

40:09.880 --> 40:12.560
<i>Part of the Tech Con Group
family of restaurants.</i>

40:14.200 --> 40:17.440
- Sorry we did not win.
- It was still worth it.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.040
Hey.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.720
Hey.

40:43.520 --> 40:48.160
Warrick just told me the winner of the race
hired him as copilot on her new contract.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.520
- That's great.
- Yeah, he sounded happy.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.160
- You don't.
- I'm fine.

40:53.240 --> 40:56.560
- You still got that ion drive to study.
- I know. Very cool.

40:56.640 --> 41:00.200
- You're just sore that you lost.
- Well, it wasn't fair.

41:00.280 --> 41:02.280
Bunch of cheaters.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.920
So what you gonna do?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.600
Next year, I'm gonna kick butt.
