WEBVTT

00:11.068 --> 00:12.655
[all gasping]Oh, my God!

00:12.655 --> 00:13.965
[Deena]
Gorgeous!It is very pretty.

00:13.965 --> 00:15.344
You're welcome.

00:15.344 --> 00:17.068
There's some weird tension
between Jenni and Mike.

00:17.068 --> 00:20.172
You have no idea what
I have done for you.

00:20.172 --> 00:22.620
I heard you said you were gonna
nail me with a pie in the face.

00:22.620 --> 00:25.310
Yo.I feel insulted!

00:25.310 --> 00:26.965
His horrible
decisions

00:26.965 --> 00:29.482
stem from the drinking
and the partying.

00:29.482 --> 00:31.103
[Ronnie]
It's so nice out today.

00:31.103 --> 00:32.379
He's talking [bleep].

00:32.379 --> 00:33.793
About me?No.

00:33.793 --> 00:35.172
Bro, you wanna start
right off the bat?

00:35.172 --> 00:37.551
What are you
talking about?

00:37.551 --> 00:41.068
Oh!

00:41.068 --> 00:43.586
♪ Here I come ♪

00:43.586 --> 00:46.206
Yeah, buddy!

00:46.206 --> 00:48.103
Party's here!

00:48.103 --> 00:50.620
The Situation
is under construction.

00:50.620 --> 00:53.448
This might not have
been the best idea.

00:53.448 --> 00:55.275
We're so classy now.

00:55.275 --> 00:58.034
On the seventh day,
it'll be lit.

00:58.034 --> 01:00.241
Get the frig out
of here, you crazy!

01:00.241 --> 01:02.862
♪ Here I come ♪♪

01:02.862 --> 01:05.241
♪ I thought you
wouldn't believe ♪

01:05.241 --> 01:07.206
♪ All the things

01:10.379 --> 01:12.379

01:12.379 --> 01:13.724

01:13.724 --> 01:16.689
Yo, Jenni!
Hook it up.

01:16.689 --> 01:19.310
Oh, wait, Mike's cooking
tonight, though.

01:19.310 --> 01:20.620
[Mike]
Now, how do you want your--

01:20.620 --> 01:21.965
your, uh, cutlets
cooked right now?

01:21.965 --> 01:23.172
Last time you baked them.

01:23.172 --> 01:24.689
Are you guys not
baking cutlets today?

01:24.689 --> 01:27.689
He's doing it, so he's
probably gonna [bleep] it up.

01:27.689 --> 01:30.000
[Mike]
JWoww wishes
I would [bleep] it up.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.482
This is the last dinner.
The whole squad is sitting down,

01:32.482 --> 01:35.620
so I cooked an awesome meal
for my roommates

01:35.620 --> 01:37.344
as a thank you for last night's

01:37.344 --> 01:38.724
help with my proposal.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.758
Don't touch-- Don't touch
my sausage and peppers.

01:41.758 --> 01:43.724
We got some chicken cutlets,
sausage and peppers,

01:43.724 --> 01:46.517
garlic bread,
some vegetables, and a salad.

01:46.517 --> 01:47.896
We got a good situation.

01:47.896 --> 01:50.206
Uh, first of all,
I'd like to thank you guys,

01:50.206 --> 01:52.620
every single one
of you guys, for last night.

01:52.620 --> 01:54.827
You know, I can't believe
I'm even here eating now.

01:54.827 --> 01:56.827
I wasn't supposed
to come down here, but I am.

01:56.827 --> 01:58.517
I got engaged.
It was awesome.

01:58.517 --> 01:59.482
I love you guys.
Thank you.

01:59.482 --> 02:00.758
You're welcome

02:00.758 --> 02:02.551
[Pauly]
Very good.Love you too.

02:02.551 --> 02:03.655
This is our last
family dinner.

02:03.655 --> 02:05.275
I think we should
go around the table,

02:05.275 --> 02:07.103
um, and just say a little
something real quick.

02:07.103 --> 02:09.275
Talk about our time here.
Our favorite moments.

02:09.275 --> 02:11.551
My personal favorites
are me and Ron spiraling.

02:11.551 --> 02:13.137
That's awesome!

02:13.137 --> 02:14.724
No!Because, like, I never--

02:14.724 --> 02:15.931
You remember those?

02:15.931 --> 02:17.965
Not really,
but I hear about them.

02:17.965 --> 02:20.275
Heyyy!

02:20.275 --> 02:23.172
We are...The degenerates are here!

02:23.172 --> 02:24.172
...spiraling.

02:24.172 --> 02:26.620
Cheers!
One, two, three, go!

02:26.620 --> 02:28.000
Whoa! [laughing]

02:28.000 --> 02:29.241
[clattering]

02:29.241 --> 02:31.758
Whoa! [laughing]

02:31.758 --> 02:34.758
You had a blast.No, I had such
a good time.

02:34.758 --> 02:36.724
I have one.
Being the prank war champion,

02:36.724 --> 02:37.758
whatever I did, the whole
Angelina thing, right?

02:37.758 --> 02:39.448
So I was like--The worst.

02:39.448 --> 02:41.931
But in a way
it was like the worst

02:41.931 --> 02:43.206
and the best prank ever.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.241
[Pauly]
Hey, girls.[Deena]
Hey!

02:44.241 --> 02:45.517
Hey, how are you?

02:45.517 --> 02:47.448
Oh, hi!Yeah-- Huh?

02:48.551 --> 02:50.241
Did you poop your pants?

02:50.241 --> 02:52.241
It was like
period [bleep].

02:52.241 --> 02:55.586
What-- Where-- What the [bleep]
world am I living in right now?

02:55.586 --> 02:57.620
Is there [bleep]
[bleep] in my pants?

02:57.620 --> 03:00.724
See, I'm-- My mind is blown!
I can't even understand it.

03:00.724 --> 03:03.931
It pranked everybody so [bleep]
good that it pranked myself.

03:03.931 --> 03:05.448
I hated myself
after that, right?

03:05.448 --> 03:08.034
But at that moment
was my highest moment,

03:08.034 --> 03:10.724
'cause I realized how much
of a family we all really are.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.896
Moving right along,
Vincent?

03:12.896 --> 03:14.551
Well, for me--

03:14.551 --> 03:17.827
You cheated.[laughter]

03:20.137 --> 03:22.551
I got it, I got it.

03:22.551 --> 03:25.275
I'm gonna choke!Oh, my God!

03:25.275 --> 03:27.000
I'll give you the
Heimlich maneuver!

03:27.000 --> 03:29.206
What can I say?
I cheated.

03:29.206 --> 03:32.931
So, anyways, I liked
when Uncle Nino and my mom came.

03:32.931 --> 03:34.068
I felt like that was...[Ronnie]
Oh, that was so...

03:34.068 --> 03:36.103
Oh, that was amazing.So needed.

03:36.103 --> 03:38.103
No way!

03:38.103 --> 03:39.827
Oh, my God.

03:39.827 --> 03:41.068
[bleep].

03:41.068 --> 03:42.586
I've been calling
you for a month.

03:42.586 --> 03:45.000
You don't pick up the phone.
So, you happy to see me?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.137
I'm happy to see you,
but I don't know how happy I am

03:47.137 --> 03:48.655
for you to be
in this crazy house.

03:48.655 --> 03:50.896
[Jenni]
Uncle Nino!What the [bleep]?

03:50.896 --> 03:52.172
What the [bleep]
are you doing?!

03:52.172 --> 03:54.068
Don't, don't, don't!

03:54.068 --> 03:55.379
I see your balls!

03:55.379 --> 03:56.965
No!

03:56.965 --> 03:58.965
What are you wearing?

03:58.965 --> 04:00.241
I get to look
at Uncle Nino

04:00.241 --> 04:02.103
and see what
I never aspire to be.

04:02.103 --> 04:03.620
You are him already!You are him!

04:03.620 --> 04:05.448
You are him when
you're drunk.When you're drunk.

04:05.448 --> 04:08.448
One more.
I'll throw it back to the
beginning when, um...

04:08.448 --> 04:11.137
Throw back.When I poured champagne
on that girl's head.

04:11.137 --> 04:12.724
Yes!

04:12.724 --> 04:14.206
That was messing with Deena.

04:14.206 --> 04:16.862
That might be
my highest moment.

04:16.862 --> 04:21.241
[electronic music playing]

04:21.241 --> 04:22.551
[Vinny]
She was about to hit Deena

04:22.551 --> 04:24.241
in the head with this bottle
of champagne.

04:24.241 --> 04:25.896
As soon as I saw that,
I was like, "Nope."

04:30.620 --> 04:33.241
Get the [bleep]
out of here!

04:33.241 --> 04:34.551
That was awesome!Thank you.

04:34.551 --> 04:36.689
The fact that Vinnie
stuck up for me like that.

04:36.689 --> 04:39.137
Like, I was like,
"He loves me."

04:39.137 --> 04:40.655
I just gave here a little
champagne shower.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.103
Jennifer?Ahem!

04:42.103 --> 04:45.103
Mine were actual,
like, little moments.

04:45.103 --> 04:48.103
Like, when Vinnie
dressed up as Victoria.

04:48.103 --> 04:49.448
Victoria!Victoria!

04:49.448 --> 04:51.000
[Nicole]
Victoria!

04:54.068 --> 04:55.310
Oh, hey, boo!

04:55.310 --> 04:57.448
What the [bleep] is that?!

04:58.896 --> 04:59.965
She's gorgeous!

05:02.103 --> 05:03.172
She's gorgeous!

05:03.172 --> 05:04.724
This is
the perfect woman!

05:04.724 --> 05:06.827
I've been waiting
for this my whole life.

05:06.827 --> 05:08.724
[laughter]

05:08.724 --> 05:12.000
Like little moments throughout
the whole time here

05:12.000 --> 05:15.758
were just great memories
that I'll have for a lifetime.[Pauly]
Mm-hmm.

05:15.758 --> 05:18.724
My best moments were obviously
coming down here.

05:18.724 --> 05:21.172
You guys were already
moved in the house,
and I was not here.

05:21.172 --> 05:23.310
Right.So when I found
that I could get here,

05:23.310 --> 05:24.965
that was a very high moment.

05:32.827 --> 05:33.931
Yay!

05:38.965 --> 05:40.551
The family is whole again.

05:40.551 --> 05:42.655
This is where I belong.

05:42.655 --> 05:46.896
This is my squad, and listen,
we got a good situation.

05:46.896 --> 05:48.344
[Deena]
Mike!

05:48.344 --> 05:49.482
It's Ron's turn.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.862
Let's get this
[bleep] over with.

05:50.862 --> 05:52.344
Yes, Ronnie's going, yes!

05:52.344 --> 05:54.344
So, I'm grateful to say
that I am blessed

05:54.344 --> 05:55.896
to have all seven
of you in my life,

05:55.896 --> 05:58.620
and I'm blessed that
Sam didn't come,

05:58.620 --> 06:01.482
because now you guys
got to see who I really am,

06:01.482 --> 06:04.034
and you got to see how fun
I am, and happy,

06:04.034 --> 06:05.034
and, like, what I really am.

06:05.034 --> 06:06.931
Not a person
that's always angry

06:06.931 --> 06:08.758
and fighting and screaming

06:08.758 --> 06:11.517
and trying to cause chaos
and drama. And sad.

06:11.517 --> 06:12.689
Like, I'm happy,
I'm fun.

06:12.689 --> 06:14.172
Like, this is who
I really am.

06:14.172 --> 06:18.172
I think Ronnie is confused
about where he is in life.

06:18.172 --> 06:21.000
He's just trying to convince
himself he's happy,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.344
but when Ronnie gets drunk,
he's talking different.

06:23.344 --> 06:26.000
Maybe you're ready to have
the child, but you're not
ready to get married--

06:26.000 --> 06:28.137
For a relationship, no, no,
I'm not, I'm not.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.724
Absolutely not, no.

06:33.103 --> 06:36.931
So, obviously,
my lowest moment

06:36.931 --> 06:39.413
was bringing those girls
back from Mokai.

06:39.413 --> 06:40.931
That was my worst decision.

06:40.931 --> 06:42.862
Let's all find
the Jacuzzi.

06:42.862 --> 06:44.172
Oh, hi.

06:44.172 --> 06:47.172
Hey, Jenni! They want
a little hot tub, so...

06:47.172 --> 06:49.172
Mm-hmm.

06:50.724 --> 06:54.448
So do this mean you are
shutting down Ronnie's Tours?

06:54.448 --> 06:55.758
[Jenni]
Ronnie's what?

06:55.758 --> 06:57.206
Ronnie's Tours.

06:57.206 --> 07:00.137
Be careful.
Very tricky stairs.

07:00.137 --> 07:03.724
This is my room.
This is the bathroom.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.137
I wonder
if this door works.

07:08.310 --> 07:10.241
Oh, 'cause he gave
a tour of the house?

07:10.241 --> 07:13.413
[all]
Ohh!

07:13.413 --> 07:15.000
[Mike]
Ronnie, you're getting
hammered tonight, son.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.551
Why you judging?Why are you judging?

07:16.551 --> 07:17.620
[Jenni]
Why you judging?

07:17.620 --> 07:20.068
[Mike]
Oh, damn!
The whole house!

07:20.068 --> 07:22.206
Thou shall
not pass judgment.

07:22.206 --> 07:24.448
[Nicole]
This is his--
He's celebrating.

07:24.448 --> 07:27.344
Mike, why do you
say Ron needs rehab?

07:27.344 --> 07:29.827
[all]
Ohh!

07:29.827 --> 07:32.655
[overlapping shouting]

07:32.655 --> 07:35.965
First of all, I'm having
a kid in, like, six weeks.

07:35.965 --> 07:37.793
When I like to drink,
I like to [bleep] party.

07:37.793 --> 07:40.689
I didn't make it my life.
You made it your life.

07:40.689 --> 07:42.000
You let it affect
your whole life.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.413
You let it destroy your life.

07:43.413 --> 07:45.241
So don't sit there
and say I [bleep] need rehab.

07:45.241 --> 07:47.103
Who said you needed rehab
at this table?

07:47.103 --> 07:49.482
You did!
You did!When?
When?

07:49.482 --> 07:51.379
You've made it a point
in the house.

07:51.379 --> 07:53.655
[Jenni]
There's a lot of history
between Ron and Mike,

07:53.655 --> 07:56.275
and they've been having
this blow for blow

07:56.275 --> 07:58.517
clap back thing
the whole vacation.

07:58.517 --> 08:01.034
We're a family.
We're here.

08:01.034 --> 08:04.517
Let's not, like, leave with
this bull[bleep] still here.

08:04.517 --> 08:05.724
Let's air it out.

08:05.724 --> 08:07.172
All right, number two,
number two...

08:07.172 --> 08:08.413
Yo, you made it a point in the
house, and I just said, yes,

08:08.413 --> 08:10.068
I get crazy when I party,

08:10.068 --> 08:11.862
but it never
affected my life, bro.

08:11.862 --> 08:12.896
You made it your life.

08:12.896 --> 08:14.379
You let it affect
your whole life.

08:14.379 --> 08:16.172
You let it destroy your life.
So don't sit here and be like,

08:16.172 --> 08:17.620
"Oh, I'm saying something."Destroy my life?

08:17.620 --> 08:20.206
Yeah, bro, look at you!
You've [bleep] got tax evasion.

08:20.206 --> 08:22.068
You almost lost everything
you [bleep] earned.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.517
Did you not call me...Yes, yes, yes...

08:23.517 --> 08:26.655
...two weeks before we came here
and said you needed rehab?

08:26.655 --> 08:28.551
Yes-- No, I said
I needed help.Are you kidding me?!

08:28.551 --> 08:30.517
I said I needed help,
and the baby coming my way.

08:30.517 --> 08:32.655
You said you were going
to rehab when you leave here!

08:32.655 --> 08:34.896
No, I said when I leave
here I'm gonna do a rehab.You said you
were going to rehab!

08:34.896 --> 08:36.448
My rehab's different
from your rehab.

08:36.448 --> 08:40.000

Well, I just wanted to clear
the air, you know what I mean?

35:16.896 --> 35:18.758
Because there was
a couple of hiccups.

35:18.758 --> 35:21.137
You know what I mean?
There was a couple of...I don't consider
them hiccups.

35:21.137 --> 35:22.862
All right. All right,
well I wanted to clear the air.

35:22.862 --> 35:24.586
Yeah.'Cause I wanted to leave
this house knowing that--

35:24.586 --> 35:26.931
I consider-- Do you fight
with your sister at all?

35:26.931 --> 35:28.103
I do.
I do.That's what I felt like.

35:28.103 --> 35:29.241
Okay.
All right.

35:29.241 --> 35:31.517
We fight because
we love each other.

35:31.517 --> 35:33.103
We're brothers
and sisters.

35:33.103 --> 35:36.137
It wouldn't be a shore house
and the seven of us

35:36.137 --> 35:37.827
if it wasn't that.

35:37.827 --> 35:39.689
I'm facing some serious [bleep]
when I get out of here.

35:39.689 --> 35:42.931
Now, if anybody on my team,
I want you to be on my team.

35:42.931 --> 35:46.103
You know what I mean?I promise you I'm--
I'm on your team.

35:46.103 --> 35:47.896
I think you're
gonna be okay.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.448
I think so too.
But I--

35:49.448 --> 35:51.241
I want to make sure
that I still got my sister,

35:51.241 --> 35:52.517
you know what I'm saying?Of course.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.241
I love you.I'll see you
back in Jersey.

35:54.241 --> 35:56.344
Of course.
Now we're going home to cold.

35:56.344 --> 35:58.275
Yes.I'm kind of excited.

36:00.896 --> 36:02.517
[Pauly]
Perfect.
Now, those are eggs.

36:02.517 --> 36:04.448
Breakfast!

36:04.448 --> 36:07.137
[Jenni]
Turkey bacon.

36:07.137 --> 36:08.931
[Mike]
Ooh, you boys outdid
yourselves today.

36:08.931 --> 36:11.275
[Pauly]
I made a fruit plate
and I made toast and some eggs.

36:11.275 --> 36:12.551
You guys outdid yourselves.

36:12.551 --> 36:15.344
Oh, my God.
This is our last breakfast.

36:15.344 --> 36:16.620
[Deena]
Thank you
for cooking, guys.

36:16.620 --> 36:18.724
[Pauly]
Welcome.Party's here.

36:18.724 --> 36:21.172
I'm excited to go home,
but this is sad.

36:21.172 --> 36:23.241
We killed it.

36:23.241 --> 36:24.931
[Ronnie]
Yo, definitely.

36:24.931 --> 36:28.206
[Vinny]
What's everyone
doing next after this?

36:28.206 --> 36:29.758
Mom mode.[Deena]
Not drinking.

36:29.758 --> 36:31.241
I'm gonna
get back on keto.

36:31.241 --> 36:34.551
[Ronnie]
Yup. I don't want to see
a bottle of alcohol...

36:34.551 --> 36:36.137
[Jenni]
Ugh....for [bleep]
like three months, bro.

36:36.137 --> 36:37.275
Back to the gym.[Nicole]
Same.

36:37.275 --> 36:39.344
Back to the gym
is right.Same.

36:39.344 --> 36:40.931
Then I'm going back on tour,
but I want to see

36:40.931 --> 36:42.620
my little one's face.
Soon as I go home I want to...

36:42.620 --> 36:44.241
[Jenni]
What are you gonna
do with her?I love her.

36:44.241 --> 36:45.620
Oh, my God.
Um, everything.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.206
[Jenni]
Yeah.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.000
[Pauly]
Mike, where do you
go from here?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.206
Um, I have to get by this
little court situation.

36:51.206 --> 36:54.517
And if I do, um, dude,
I don't know.

36:54.517 --> 36:55.896
I don't know what
I would do, dude.

36:55.896 --> 36:57.206
Really.

36:57.206 --> 36:59.241
I feel like we should
do this more often.

36:59.241 --> 37:00.344
[all]
Yeah.

37:00.344 --> 37:01.793
Agree, but not for...

37:01.793 --> 37:03.689
Not like so much that we get
sick of each other again.

37:03.689 --> 37:06.068
Long week.
Four or five days.Like, yeah, let's hang out.

37:06.068 --> 37:07.551
Let's hang out.Let's hang out, guys.

37:07.551 --> 37:09.206
No doubt. I want to see what's
going on in all you guys' lives.

37:09.206 --> 37:10.758
Yeah.Yeah.

37:10.758 --> 37:13.310
I'm so happy with how this
vacation turned out.

37:13.310 --> 37:15.931
No one went to jail.
Everyone's happy.

37:15.931 --> 37:17.310
We truly
love each other, leaving.

37:17.310 --> 37:18.793
Let's get the [bleep]
out of here.

37:18.793 --> 37:20.482
Yeah, buddy!

37:20.482 --> 37:24.241
And we just proved that it
doesn't matter how old you are,

37:24.241 --> 37:26.413
you can [bleep]
still rage.

Oof.

37:49.793 --> 37:50.896
Dude, we really
killed it.

37:50.896 --> 37:52.517
Yeah, we did.Proud of us.

37:52.517 --> 37:54.103
That's like
the best one ever.I know.

37:54.103 --> 37:57.344
Damn! Better hit the gym
when I get out of here.

37:57.344 --> 37:58.379
[bleep]!

37:58.379 --> 38:00.896
Whoa, I'm drunk.

38:00.896 --> 38:02.379
This vacation like,
went like that.

38:02.379 --> 38:03.655
I'm so excited
to go home to my family.

38:03.655 --> 38:05.793
You know, I miss my kids.
I miss Jionni.

38:05.793 --> 38:07.448
I can't wait
to be a mom again.

38:07.448 --> 38:08.655
But at the same time,
I'm just like,

38:08.655 --> 38:10.655
I'm going to miss
these ass[bleep].

38:10.655 --> 38:12.241
I love them so much.

38:12.241 --> 38:16.724
I would like to say for one
last time this summer... that...

38:16.724 --> 38:18.241
[silly voice]
the cabs are here!

38:18.241 --> 38:19.655
[Mike]
Our cabs are here!

38:19.655 --> 38:21.310
[Nicole]
Cab's here!
Group hug.

38:21.310 --> 38:23.793
I love you all.
Group huggies.

38:25.275 --> 38:28.172
Oh, this was by far
the best family vacation ever.

38:28.172 --> 38:29.551
I think I lived it up.

38:29.551 --> 38:32.551
I think I was pretty classy
for the most part,

38:32.551 --> 38:34.344
but I still showed
my meatball side.

38:34.344 --> 38:36.517
Family vacation.Wait, where are the meatballs?

38:36.517 --> 38:37.931
[laughter]

38:37.931 --> 38:40.724
I am so ready to go home
and make a little meatball

38:40.724 --> 38:43.206
with my Christopher,
and it's going to be amazing.

38:43.206 --> 38:44.310
[Vinny]
Smells like alcohol
in this huddle.

38:44.310 --> 38:45.586
[Nicole]
Oh, it's me.

38:45.586 --> 38:46.931
It's me, I'm sorry.
I blew.

38:46.931 --> 38:48.103
Smells like a bar.

38:49.965 --> 38:52.965

38:52.965 --> 38:54.137
Best to ever do it.

38:54.137 --> 38:55.655
This vacation
turned out dope,

38:55.655 --> 38:56.965
and I'm going home
to my little girl.

38:56.965 --> 38:58.482
But I'm worried
for my boy, Ronnie.

38:58.482 --> 39:00.586
He's going through a whole
roller coaster of emotions.

39:00.586 --> 39:02.517
One day he wants to be
with his baby mama,

39:02.517 --> 39:05.275
the next day he does not,
and he has to go home to that.

39:05.275 --> 39:07.448
So, I'm happy that Ronnie
and I both live in Las Vegas,

39:07.448 --> 39:09.655
so he can always
come to me for advice,

39:09.655 --> 39:11.379
and I will be there for him.
He's my bro.

39:11.379 --> 39:13.482
[Mike]
Oh, my God,
we're out of this bitch!

39:13.482 --> 39:14.620
[Nicole]
Mike, you made it.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.655
I know,
I [bleep] made it is right.

39:15.655 --> 39:17.931
I'm so proud of you.Thank you.

39:17.931 --> 39:20.241
My future is a little
uncertain right now.

39:20.241 --> 39:22.344
I'm going home
to a serious court case,

39:22.344 --> 39:26.793
but my friends have my back,
my family has my back,

39:26.793 --> 39:29.931
and my beautiful fiancée is
with me every step of the way.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.931
You're my best friend.

39:34.931 --> 39:36.137
I don't know what's gonna happen
in the next couple months,

39:36.137 --> 39:37.724
and that's a scary feeling.

39:37.724 --> 39:40.896
I'm gonna have, like,
a little Ronnie running around

39:40.896 --> 39:44.379
with her little crazy legs,
crying and screaming.

39:44.379 --> 39:47.896
I'm gonna give it my all,
and we'll be good.
I know we will.

39:47.896 --> 39:49.482

about getting together,

it was gonna happen.

much from this vacation,
