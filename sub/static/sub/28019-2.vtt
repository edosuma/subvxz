ERIC:
We're in.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.566
OLIVER: Okay, he
sent the selfie.

36:17.610 --> 36:18.828
Can you ping it?

36:18.872 --> 36:19.916
Send the coordinates
to Zara.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.614
We need to shut down
Black Dolphin

36:21.657 --> 36:24.182
before he sends his
final question to Julian.No pressure.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.968
OLIVER: Zara,
you're right on top of him.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.928
Eric, I found him.

36:31.972 --> 36:34.279
Sam? Sam.

36:34.322 --> 36:37.325
My name is Zara.Just go away, please.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.284
You don't have to do this, Sam.Yes, I do.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.721
You don't understand.Actually, Sam,

36:41.764 --> 36:43.331
I do.

36:43.375 --> 36:47.117
I know why you're
doing this. Look.

36:47.161 --> 36:49.076
I've been playing, too.

36:49.119 --> 36:50.730
What level?Not as far as you.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.253
You're at level 60, right?ERIC: Shut it down, Oliver.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.473
OLIVER: Yeah, it's harder
than it looks, Eric.

36:54.516 --> 36:56.866
I have to find the source code
and activate the kill switch.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.346
ZARA:
I know that you're in pain

36:58.390 --> 36:59.826
and feeling lonely,

36:59.869 --> 37:01.349
and maybe you felt less lonely

37:01.393 --> 37:02.872
when you were playing
Black Dolphin.

37:02.916 --> 37:05.135
Maybe you felt like
you made a friend,

37:05.179 --> 37:06.528
but the person you think

37:06.572 --> 37:09.270
you were talking to
is a computer program, Sam.

37:09.314 --> 37:12.230
That's not true.

37:12.273 --> 37:14.362
OLIVER:
Kill switch activated.

37:14.406 --> 37:16.451
Black Dolphin, you're dead.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.236
Oh, crap.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.846
What?

37:19.889 --> 37:21.630
OLIVER:
We're too late.

37:21.674 --> 37:24.633
[phone chimes]

37:26.113 --> 37:27.375
ERIC:
Zara, we've shut it down,

37:27.419 --> 37:28.768
but the bot sent Sam
his final message.

37:28.811 --> 37:31.684
What was Sam's question?"What's next?" Answer:

37:31.727 --> 37:32.989
"Immortality, Sam."

37:35.035 --> 37:36.993
The question you asked,
it was, "What's next?"

37:37.037 --> 37:38.995
Am I right?

37:39.039 --> 37:41.476
How did...
how did you know that?

37:41.520 --> 37:45.001
Same way I know
the answer you got.

37:45.045 --> 37:46.220
"Immortality, Sam."

37:46.264 --> 37:48.178
I told you,

37:48.222 --> 37:50.311
it's a computer program,
it's not a real person.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.313
I bet it even told you
that you were special

37:52.357 --> 37:53.662
because you
got to ask

37:53.706 --> 37:55.534
a question at level 60, right?

37:55.577 --> 37:58.145
Yeah.

37:58.188 --> 38:01.801
The game says that
to every player.

38:01.844 --> 38:05.544
Do you know why it's called
Black Dolphin, Sam?

38:05.587 --> 38:07.241
Because dolphins
are the only animals

38:07.285 --> 38:08.373
that seem to attempt suicide.

38:08.416 --> 38:11.289
Yeah, they strand
themselves

38:11.332 --> 38:14.117
in shallow water when
they're sick or injured

38:14.161 --> 38:17.251
because they're in pain
and no one else can help.

38:19.253 --> 38:21.690
But you're not alone, Sam.

38:21.734 --> 38:24.389
I know it feels like you're
in a tunnel with no way out,

38:24.432 --> 38:28.610
but... it will get better.

38:28.654 --> 38:32.919
[crying]: How do you...
how do you... how do you know?

38:32.962 --> 38:37.924
Because your family is on their
way and they love you, Sam.

38:37.967 --> 38:39.142
They want to listen.

38:39.186 --> 38:42.537
They're on your side.

38:42.581 --> 38:45.584
So am I.
But I need you

38:45.627 --> 38:48.151
to be on your side, too.

38:51.154 --> 38:54.767
So take the rope off your neck
and give me your hand.

39:15.309 --> 39:17.398
It's gonna be okay.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.925
MAN:
Black Dolphin is neutralized.

39:22.969 --> 39:25.232
Okay, guys, great job.

39:25.275 --> 39:27.103
KATE: We've got a full list
of the players

39:27.147 --> 39:29.367
and we're contacting
the families now.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.847
I just got off with Zara.
Sam Rigaud is in safe hands.

39:31.891 --> 39:34.067
Good.

39:34.110 --> 39:38.854
Thank you...
for everything.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.596
Glad we could help.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.294
Your methods are
definitely unorthodox,

39:44.338 --> 39:47.341
but I think
I like unorthodox.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.350
You're back! [laughs]

39:56.394 --> 39:57.830
[gasps] Daddy!
Hey!

39:57.873 --> 39:59.875
Hey, come here.How's my big boy?
Mm, I missed you.

39:59.919 --> 40:02.356
How are you? Have you been
good for your mother?AMY: Yes.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.967
I hope so.
You been having fun?AMY: [chuckles] Yeah.

40:05.011 --> 40:06.404
Honey, why did you color this?

40:06.447 --> 40:09.581
Because it's pretty.Come on.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.325
Hi, baby.
Hey, baby.

40:15.369 --> 40:16.501
Hi, baby.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.241
Hey.

40:18.285 --> 40:21.854
Oh...[groaning]

40:21.897 --> 40:23.464
You okay?

40:23.508 --> 40:27.686
Mm. Yes. I just
missed you guys.

40:27.729 --> 40:30.471
I don't think I can take
my work home anymore.

40:30.515 --> 40:34.867
We're gonna have to
figure something out.

40:34.910 --> 40:37.609
Right? Right?
Mm.

40:37.652 --> 40:38.958
OLIVER:
Julian's dead.

40:39.001 --> 40:41.613
Black Dolphin's shut down.

40:41.656 --> 40:44.354
So why do I feel like
he's still out there?

40:44.398 --> 40:46.966
Because as long
as the Internet exists,

40:47.009 --> 40:50.317
there'll always be online
predators and vulnerable people.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.232
You know, the only thing
that can fight isolation

40:52.275 --> 40:55.409
is real connection.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.151
Hey, how would you guys, uh,
feel about coming to dinner

40:58.194 --> 41:00.414
at my place sometime?

41:00.458 --> 41:04.200
Sure, sounds good.
I'm in.

41:04.244 --> 41:07.595
Good. Don't get too excited.
I might bail early.
