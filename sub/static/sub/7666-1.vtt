01:44.504 --> 01:45.937
Turn around.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.014
I'll bite your head off.

02:07.427 --> 02:08.985
I'll see you
out there. Yeah, yeah.

02:09.195 --> 02:12.255
Yeah, motherfuckers.
We'll fuck your ass up, man.

02:12.432 --> 02:16.596
In The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran
writes about good and evil.

02:16.769 --> 02:18.930
"Of the good in you,
I can speak,

02:20.006 --> 02:22.099
but not of the evil."

02:22.475 --> 02:27.503
You are only good...
when you are at one with yourself.

02:32.408 --> 02:36.093
Chief, what you went through
in here I wouldn't wish on any man.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.297
But you survived.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.856
You didn't ask for trouble.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.663
But you didn't back down
from it either.

02:50.870 --> 02:54.829
It was as if you were born
to the darkness in this place.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.540
I hope to God...

02:59.245 --> 03:03.875
that this day...
you put that darkness behind you.

03:10.256 --> 03:13.851
I want you to know,
there is help on the outside.

03:14.060 --> 03:18.603
So if you get to thinking it's too much
and you can't handle the pressure,

03:18.831 --> 03:21.527
please call
one of these numbers.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.902
Do you have any questions?

03:29.976 --> 03:31.671
Where's the exit?

07:13.065 --> 07:15.295
Oh, what are you doing?
Hey!

07:15.468 --> 07:17.454
Hey, what the hell?

07:18.438 --> 07:19.735
May I help you?

07:20.139 --> 07:22.573
Sir? Sir!

07:33.586 --> 07:35.520
Now, that happens,
we'll be...

07:44.797 --> 07:46.230
Jesus.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.119
How's it going, man?

08:17.530 --> 08:20.522
You know how it is.
One day good, the next not so good.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.964
Just have to go with the flow
a little bit, you know?

08:25.004 --> 08:26.301
So, uh...

08:31.143 --> 08:32.667
You don't trust me.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.674
All right.

08:38.384 --> 08:41.649
Man, what did I tell you
about that hairy change, huh?

08:43.054 --> 08:46.388
Okay, if you don't want my goddamn
business, I'll take it elsewhere.

08:46.755 --> 08:47.890
It's your jones, Holmes.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.725
Wait a minute.
Please.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.808
I'm sorry. I was just
messin' with you, okay?

08:58.804 --> 09:01.364
It's-it's me.
You know me.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.867
Please.

09:16.455 --> 09:17.683
Okay, okay.

10:32.431 --> 10:34.216
Oh, no.

10:38.671 --> 10:39.831
Hey.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.769
Will you look at that?

10:41.941 --> 10:44.257
Looks like
somebody got lost.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.622
What do we got?

11:01.460 --> 11:04.093
Wha...? What do we got?

11:04.463 --> 11:06.693
- Yeah, I caught the case.
- No, you didn't.

11:06.866 --> 11:09.699
- Yeah.
- You... you couldn't have.

11:10.236 --> 11:11.430
Why is that?

11:13.572 --> 11:16.973
Because Mallory would
never put you on my case.

11:17.383 --> 11:19.644
Listen, I don't like this
any more than you do.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.458
I'm a couple o' weeks away
from retirement,

11:21.458 --> 11:23.047
I got paperwork
up my ass.

11:23.047 --> 11:26.585
So, when the supervising sergeant
tells me to jump,

11:26.819 --> 11:28.946
I just go
with the flow, baby.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.321
- You can't smoke in here.
- Sorry.

11:36.495 --> 11:39.097
Get me a good tight shot
of that exit wound.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.666
<i>The breaking news: It is being
reported that a gunman entered</i>

11:43.836 --> 11:47.591
<i>a downtown Bakersfield office building
this afternoon and opened fire,</i>

11:47.591 --> 11:50.449
<i>killing an employee who worked
at Central Cal-Tela Marketing.</i>

11:50.709 --> 11:51.691
<i>The suspect remains...</i>

11:51.691 --> 11:54.210
<i>- Kitty, stop!
- He is described as a male in his 30s,</i>

11:54.380 --> 11:57.247
<i>approximately 6"3' tall
with closely cropped hair.</i>

11:57.416 --> 11:59.919
<i>Police have not yet released
the name of the victim.</i>

12:16.802 --> 12:20.368
<i>The gunman was described
as armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

12:21.073 --> 12:22.854
Let me call you
right back.

12:25.878 --> 12:27.718
Well, well.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.574
You've been a bad boy.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.653
It's a nice set of wheels
I got you out there.

12:39.325 --> 12:40.724
You got my money?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.082
Hm.

12:51.170 --> 12:54.070
Now, how'd you smuggle
that much money out o' prison?

12:54.473 --> 12:55.906
You don't wanna know.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.774
I want the other names.

13:02.581 --> 13:04.310
The price just went up.

13:05.484 --> 13:08.476
It took me 10 whole years
to track down these people for you.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.349
And it cost a lot of money.

13:10.546 --> 13:13.747
And now I wants
to renegotiate.

13:15.828 --> 13:17.370
Okay.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.190
That's what I thought.
You're playin' ball now.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.198
The price just went down.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.333
Kenny?

13:27.873 --> 13:28.965
Kenny.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.775
This here is
my Samoan friend.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.347
Ultimate Fighting champion
over in Guam.

13:37.583 --> 13:41.576
You don't know half the sick shit
they do over there just to win a title.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.733
I know what that is.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.269
- I know who you are.
- Who is he?

14:00.439 --> 14:01.872
Brother,
I ain't got no beef with you.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.373
Stop bumpin' your gums
and do what I pay you to do.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.556
- What... what are you doing?
- This dude's a ghost.

14:07.413 --> 14:10.143
- I can't mess with no ghost.
- You better get your fat ass back.

14:10.316 --> 14:14.316
- I ain't messing with no ghost.
- Bald-headed Precious. Get your...

14:17.623 --> 14:20.330
Here, I owe you a refund.
Here you go.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.595
He looks so familiar.

14:24.763 --> 14:27.207
I have seen him somewhere,
I know it.

14:29.134 --> 14:30.587
Really?

14:35.007 --> 14:36.998
All right,
here it comes.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.409
Look at his face.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.267
He knew
his number was up.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.876
Wait a minute.

14:49.755 --> 14:52.189
That's not just fear,
that's recognition.

14:52.905 --> 14:55.096
He can't see where the gun is
from where he's sitting.

14:55.131 --> 14:56.903
It's blocked
by the partition.

14:57.429 --> 15:01.195
- He knew 'im.
- Phew, maybe.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.129
- Hello?
- Marina?

15:35.301 --> 15:38.218
- Hey, it's me.
- Do you know what time it is?

15:38.437 --> 15:40.462
Yes, I-I know...
I know it's late, I'm sorry.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.800
- Call me right...
- Okay, okay.

15:42.975 --> 15:46.342
<i>- You're taking him to the game.
- Yes, I'll be there tomorrow.</i>

15:46.512 --> 15:50.073
I'll-I'll-I'll pick him up tomorrow.
Yes, I'll be on time.

15:50.249 --> 15:53.918
<i>- Don't let him down. Promise.
- Yes, I promise.</i>

15:55.454 --> 15:56.978
But listen... Listen.

17:38.524 --> 17:39.749
Mornin'.

17:40.023 --> 17:42.256
You see, I did a sequence
of poses this morning

17:42.428 --> 17:44.919
that only... only 10 people
on the planet can do.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.394
Ending
with the corpse pose.

17:47.823 --> 17:49.624
But you know what,
I'm done with yoga.

17:49.868 --> 17:51.267
I beat it.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.634
- You beat yoga?
- Yeah.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.726
- It's time to move on.
- To what?

18:01.747 --> 18:03.476
I don't know.

18:06.051 --> 18:08.076
Something more ultimate.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.339
Sometimes I worry
that a real corpse pose

18:14.339 --> 18:16.210
is the only thing
that's gonna satisfy you.

18:16.245 --> 18:18.061
No, come on,
not-not death.

18:19.164 --> 18:20.812
Life.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.864
Oh, I've never felt
so alive.

18:23.068 --> 18:24.729
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:47.993 --> 18:51.571
<i>Got a new client for you.
I know you like a challenge.</i>

18:51.897 --> 18:54.195
<i>We're gathering information
on possible locations.</i>

18:54.399 --> 18:56.333
<i>I'll send you
the target spec now.</i>

18:56.502 --> 18:59.130
<i>The client thinks
the target's coming after him.</i>

18:59.338 --> 19:02.094
<i>- He needs the job done fast.
- Okay.</i>

19:10.649 --> 19:12.316
Who's he?

19:14.953 --> 19:17.547
It's not a question
I ever ask.

19:58.397 --> 20:02.527
- Sure you don't wanna stay a while?
- Hold that thought.

20:24.523 --> 20:25.615
It's my work.

20:26.188 --> 20:28.792
It's getting harder and harder
to go on these jobs.

20:28.994 --> 20:31.462
<i>You mentioned this before
at our last session.</i>

20:31.630 --> 20:35.259
<i>- Can you take some time off?
- No, no, no, that's not an option.</i>

20:35.500 --> 20:37.434
My business is important.
I keep my edge.

20:37.636 --> 20:40.070
<i>Well, you still haven't told me
what it is you actually do now.</i>

20:40.272 --> 20:42.240
I'm a surgeon.
I remove cancer.

20:42.407 --> 20:45.408
<i>Well, I'll have to take you
at your word.</i>

20:45.669 --> 20:48.478
<i>You know, I have other patients
in the medical field.</i>

20:48.647 --> 20:52.447
<i>And they also find it hard to handle
the stress associated with their jobs.</i>

20:53.494 --> 20:57.088
<i>There's a lot of pressure when
you have someone's life in your hands.</i>

21:03.061 --> 21:06.824
- Morning, detective Cicero.
- Sergeant Mallory.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.531
Don't be mad.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.296
You should've told me first.

21:11.536 --> 21:15.063
You're right, you should've
heard it from me. I'm sorry.

21:15.807 --> 21:17.604
I should've told you.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.934
Let him help you
with the case, though.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.645
So, what do we got?

21:29.054 --> 21:32.080
You play fast and loose
with that "we" shit, cowboy.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.320
We got our shooter.

21:38.163 --> 21:39.858
"We"?

21:40.432 --> 21:42.923
I got a call from
the warden at Murdoch last night.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.001
He recognized our guy
in the news.

21:45.203 --> 21:48.934
Apparently, he made a lot of money...
running contraband in prison.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.269
- Any gang affiliations?
- Nope, did his whole 10.

21:52.516 --> 21:55.470
No protection. A walk-alone.
They kept comin' after 'im.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.447
He kept
knockin' them down.

21:57.971 --> 21:59.149
I see. He kept score.

21:59.351 --> 22:02.946
Yeah, all he had to do was flash that
and no one would screw with 'im.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.949
He got popped for a bank job.
Ten years ago, Bakersfield First.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.964
Don't be a hero, you got me?
Huh? Stay down.

22:13.676 --> 22:15.827
- So, shooter was a bank robber.
- He was a driver.

22:16.735 --> 22:17.963
- Go, go!
- Get in.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.910
Go, go, go, go!

22:38.357 --> 22:39.825
Look out!

22:52.671 --> 22:53.763
What are you doin'?
Why are we stoppin'?

22:53.939 --> 22:56.630
- Man, you're gonna get us all killed.
- Hold on. He knows what he's doin'.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.682
Do your thing,
little brother.

23:00.011 --> 23:01.566
Go, go, go, go!

23:09.857 --> 23:11.055
Damn it, what's he doing?

23:13.892 --> 23:15.184
Where you goin'?

23:18.764 --> 23:20.789
They passed.
They passed. Do it.

23:23.702 --> 23:27.069
I don't see anyone else.
I think we're clear. Slow down.

23:27.272 --> 23:28.864
Slow down!

23:36.815 --> 23:39.579
Turn it around.
Turn it around. You son of a...

23:40.585 --> 23:42.177
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

23:42.387 --> 23:44.287
Cops, man!
They're right there!

23:47.959 --> 23:49.756
- Good, go!
- Cops, cops!

23:59.738 --> 24:01.103
You're good, you're good,
you're good!

24:02.474 --> 24:04.465
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Rip it. Rip it.

24:19.090 --> 24:22.116
- Now, he made a clean getaway.
- So, who collared 'im?

24:22.327 --> 24:24.844
Good, this is where
it gets really interesting.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.137
I wanna
show you something.

24:27.332 --> 24:29.230
Check this out.

24:29.351 --> 24:31.301
Oh, my.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.438
This is such a big help.

24:33.605 --> 24:36.130
It takes me such a long time
to get up those stairs.

24:36.341 --> 24:38.465
You can put the things down
anywhere over here.

24:38.465 --> 24:39.740
Okay.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.542
- You okay?
- Yes.

24:45.737 --> 24:47.274
Thank you
for your concern.

24:47.452 --> 24:51.142
- You're very kind to help an old man.
- Sure.

24:51.356 --> 24:54.258
- I'm gonna go.
- Can I offer you something to drink?

24:54.504 --> 24:57.079
- Um, actually I should be going.
- No, let-let me get you something.

24:57.079 --> 24:58.031
It's right here.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.074
Please,
it's the least I can do.

25:00.198 --> 25:04.317
Be nice to have a...
a little company for a change.

25:07.305 --> 25:09.671
You see, I-I changed careers
because I...

25:09.841 --> 25:12.366
Well, I had some issues
I needed to resolve.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.281
You know,
I needed to test myself.

25:18.483 --> 25:25.209
Mentally and... physically.
Really... recreate myself.

25:25.323 --> 25:27.791
<i>And now it's all become
too easy.</i>

25:27.993 --> 25:30.518
Yes. Yes.

25:30.729 --> 25:34.028
I'm bored, but I mean,
that's... that's only part of it.

25:35.066 --> 25:36.693
I mean, it's Lily.

25:36.902 --> 25:38.233
She's a distraction.

25:38.436 --> 25:40.836
Distractions can be a problem
in my line of work.

26:03.895 --> 26:07.422
<i>You were going to talk to her
about marriage and having a family.</i>

26:07.599 --> 26:10.037
<i>Is that still
something you want?</i>

26:13.939 --> 26:15.998
You know what?
You're right.

26:18.610 --> 26:21.868
I mean, she's the woman I wanna
spend the rest of my life with.

26:22.347 --> 26:24.042
<i>So, are you gonna ask her
to marry you?</i>

26:24.215 --> 26:25.477
That's what I'll do.

26:25.730 --> 26:27.162
I'll pop the question.

26:28.900 --> 26:31.154
<i>- Are you off your meds?
- Yes.</i>

26:31.356 --> 26:34.120
<i>As your therapist,
I have to advise against that.</i>

26:34.359 --> 26:35.553
Gotta go.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.672
<i>All right, look,
there's two cars.</i>

26:49.874 --> 26:51.171
<i>Quiet.</i>

26:51.576 --> 26:52.804
<i>All right,
you're good.</i>

26:52.978 --> 26:55.071
<i>All right, you guys
and boys. Here we go.</i>

26:55.680 --> 26:56.923
<i>Shh, be quiet.</i>

27:00.251 --> 27:01.616
<i>Back, back, back!</i>

27:01.786 --> 27:02.980
<i>Hands up!</i>

27:03.154 --> 27:05.520
<i>- Back up.
- Tell me what's going on here?</i>

27:05.690 --> 27:09.387
After the bank job, they got
ambushed by another crew.

27:09.594 --> 27:11.434
Somebody set 'im up.

27:11.596 --> 27:13.257
And somebody taped it?

27:13.713 --> 27:15.956
Sick bastard made
his own personal snuff film.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.795
<i>- Where's the money?
- Tell them.</i>

27:17.969 --> 27:20.335
I knew I remembered
this guy from somewhere.

27:20.538 --> 27:22.130
Where the hell
did you get this?

27:22.340 --> 27:23.395
First week
I made detective,

27:23.395 --> 27:26.610
Vice had busted this illegal
hardcore porn operation.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.841
I walked in the bullpen, and...
they were watching this.

27:29.047 --> 27:31.675
I pretended I got a phone call,
had to walk out.

27:32.014 --> 27:33.545
Just didn't have
the stomach for it.

27:34.285 --> 27:35.775
<i>Bank robbers, huh?</i>

27:35.954 --> 27:38.787
<i>- Tough guys.
- Don't tell 'em.</i>

27:38.990 --> 27:41.959
I flipped it to Homicide,
but... never went anywhere.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.159
Why is that?

27:43.159 --> 27:46.552
Never see the killers' faces.
Not once.

27:46.587 --> 27:48.557
<i>- Where's the money?
- Don't tell him, bro.</i>

27:48.733 --> 27:50.200
<i>Brothers?
Is that your brother?</i>

27:50.368 --> 27:52.529
<i>- I don't see the resemblance.
- Yeah.</i>

27:52.704 --> 27:56.880
<i>You want me to shoot 'im?
Huh? Like the others?</i>

27:57.248 --> 27:59.999
<i>He's not gonna kill me,
he's bluffin'.</i>

28:00.178 --> 28:03.190
<i>Bluffin'?
Two down and I'm bluffin'?</i>

28:03.527 --> 28:05.580
<i>You want me to shoot 'im?
Think twice.</i>

28:05.750 --> 28:07.775
<i>You want me to shoot 'im,
huh? Like the others?</i>

28:09.487 --> 28:11.318
<i>- Don't you tell 'im.
- Please, don't shoot 'im.</i>

28:11.489 --> 28:14.219
<i>- He's not gonna shoot.
- Let's tell him where it is.</i>

28:14.392 --> 28:16.292
<i>But it's
our only leverage.</i>

28:17.862 --> 28:19.124
<i>I'm sorry
I got you into this, bro.</i>

28:19.297 --> 28:21.356
<i>Just tell me
where the money is.</i>

28:21.772 --> 28:23.558
I bet
you're a good student.

28:24.736 --> 28:25.998
Yeah.

28:28.006 --> 28:30.736
- Thanks for the drink.
- Sure.

28:30.975 --> 28:32.632
I should get going.

28:51.529 --> 28:53.834
<i>Sorry I got you
into this, bro.</i>

28:54.933 --> 28:56.594
<i>Sorry I dragged you
into this.</i>

28:56.768 --> 28:59.259
<i>- Last chance.
- Don't tell him, bro.</i>

29:00.238 --> 29:02.297
<i>- Please, don't shoot him.
- Don't do it.</i>

29:02.507 --> 29:03.838
<i>It's up to you.</i>

29:04.008 --> 29:05.873
<i>Don't you tell 'im, bro.
Don't.</i>

29:08.146 --> 29:10.312
<i>It's under the floor boards
of the kitchen.</i>

29:10.515 --> 29:11.948
<i>There you go.</i>

29:31.636 --> 29:35.012
<i>- Gary, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.</i>

29:36.107 --> 29:38.166
<i>- I'm sorry.
- It's gonna be okay, bro.</i>

29:39.778 --> 29:41.633
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

29:43.948 --> 29:45.245
<i>Nooo!</i>

29:45.416 --> 29:47.788
<i>Oh, Jesus, man, no!</i>

29:48.335 --> 29:49.078
<i>N-noooo!</i>

29:55.927 --> 29:57.986
<i>- Gotta get that money.
- Aw, Jesus, man.</i>

30:08.573 --> 30:10.861
<i>Gary!</i>

30:11.309 --> 30:14.301
<i>Told you...
wouldn't shoot 'im.</i>

30:14.512 --> 30:16.070
<i>- Watch him.
- Okay.</i>

30:16.281 --> 30:17.900
<i>See if he's lyin'.</i>

30:18.483 --> 30:19.507
<i>I got it.</i>

30:24.289 --> 30:25.722
<i>Lift this up
in the bag.</i>

30:26.691 --> 30:28.181
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

30:34.799 --> 30:36.630
<i>Smile for the camera.</i>

30:41.172 --> 30:42.969
Smile for the camera.

31:02.393 --> 31:04.324
I didn't know.

31:04.996 --> 31:07.055
I didn't know that any of that
was gonna happen.

31:10.034 --> 31:13.265
Don't, please!
He made us do it.

31:34.525 --> 31:36.459
Please, don't hurt me.

31:37.362 --> 31:39.387
I'm not gonna hurt you.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.427
<i>Smile for the camera.</i>

33:16.661 --> 33:19.223
<i>I'm gonna kill you all.</i>

33:22.867 --> 33:24.558
They killed 'im.

33:25.703 --> 33:27.421
What do you mean
"they killed 'im"?

33:27.421 --> 33:28.538
He was dead.

33:28.773 --> 33:32.869
At least for a little while anyway.
The hospital pronounced him DOA.

33:39.584 --> 33:40.805
Can you hear me?

33:41.719 --> 33:42.757
Bullet hit here,

33:42.757 --> 33:44.398
ricocheted around
the outside of his skull,

33:44.398 --> 33:45.177
came out
through his cheek.

33:45.223 --> 33:48.249
He's got a metal plate holding
the back of his head together.

33:48.426 --> 33:50.360
I mean,
this guy refused to die.

33:51.929 --> 33:56.525
And now, he must be going
after everyone in that video.

34:07.345 --> 34:10.074
You said you wouldn't be late.
Where the hell have you been?

34:10.248 --> 34:11.724
Sorry, I caught a case.
A homicide.

34:11.724 --> 34:13.657
You're supposed to take Tommy
to his baseball game.

34:13.657 --> 34:15.455
And you made me late
for my class too.

34:15.455 --> 34:18.572
I'm sorry, it's a...
it's a big deal, this case.

34:21.525 --> 34:24.120
I saw it on TV.
I do not wanna hear about it.

34:24.362 --> 34:27.263
You want me to have full custody?
I will take full custody.

34:27.431 --> 34:29.431
You know I don't want that.
I don't... I don't want that.

34:29.431 --> 34:31.871
Then take him
to his damn baseball game!

34:31.871 --> 34:33.710
Okay. All right.

34:34.371 --> 34:35.429
What's up, champ?

34:36.908 --> 34:41.339
- What position they got you playing at?
- Don't play much.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.313
Well, you got an arm
like a cannon.

34:44.482 --> 34:46.574
I don't know why
they wouldn't be lettin' you play.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.224
I know.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.235
Maybe I should have a talk
with that coach

34:51.235 --> 34:52.739
to supplicate and get you
in there somewhere.

34:52.739 --> 34:54.606
Maybe pinch-hit or somethin'.
What do you say?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.590
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Cicero.

35:03.916 --> 35:06.635
<i>There's been another shooting.
I-I-I think this could be our guy.</i>

35:06.804 --> 35:07.588
Yeah.

35:08.005 --> 35:09.712
<i>Mallory wants you
down at the crime scene.</i>

35:10.074 --> 35:14.977
- Okay, I'll be in a little bit.
- Uh-uh, 4045 Danson Road. Got it?

35:15.250 --> 35:16.810
<i>I'll be there in an hour.</i>

35:24.155 --> 35:26.953
Hey, you know what?
I-I'm not gonna make it in today.

35:27.158 --> 35:31.088
I'm taking my son to a baseball game.
It's really important that I be there.

35:31.963 --> 35:35.160
Well, you know what?
That's just too bad.

35:35.399 --> 35:37.067
All right, bye.

35:38.302 --> 35:41.135
Good grief.
Can you imagine that?

35:41.339 --> 35:44.557
I already told them I had
a ball game to go to today.

35:50.715 --> 35:54.520
Incredible.
You're a full two hours late.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.532
- John, did you...?
- So, what do we got?

35:57.188 --> 35:58.309
What do you got?

35:59.824 --> 36:01.883
Our guy did the world
a favor on this one.

36:02.141 --> 36:04.597
Found out
who shot our snuff films.

36:05.129 --> 36:06.385
Excuse me.

36:06.697 --> 36:09.027
So, we got a telemarketer
and a sex offender.

36:09.027 --> 36:10.585
What's next, a lawyer?

36:10.620 --> 36:12.359
Whole shebang
just got a whole lot weirder.

36:12.537 --> 36:15.295
Witnesses placed a
second shooter at the scene.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.633
After our suspect
whacked Mr. Rogers here,

36:17.808 --> 36:20.875
he went and... had
a little shootout in the hall.

36:22.146 --> 36:24.137
- Maybe an armed neighbor.
- Uh-uh.

36:24.348 --> 36:25.975
No one recognized
this dude.

36:26.150 --> 36:29.764
They exchanged gunfire,
then disappeared. Both of them.

36:30.321 --> 36:32.516
How 'bout the second shooter?
Any description?

36:32.787 --> 36:34.873
The word "beautiful"
came up.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.991
- Beautiful?
- Like a movie star.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.824
He punked me.

36:41.332 --> 36:42.424
He's really that good?

36:42.600 --> 36:44.363
<i>No, good's not even
the right word.</i>

36:44.535 --> 36:47.402
<i>I mean, you know,
the dude's completely artless.</i>

36:48.019 --> 36:51.578
I mean, there's no-no sophistication
to him whatsoever.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.867
But he's pure,
you know?

36:54.478 --> 36:58.209
No fear, no-no hesitation.
There's nothing.

36:58.983 --> 37:01.747
- He as fast as you?
- No, he's faster.

37:05.523 --> 37:07.137
You'll get 'im.

37:07.925 --> 37:10.257
How can you be
so sure, hey?

37:10.995 --> 37:12.690
Because you always do.

37:16.767 --> 37:19.775
<i>- Baby.
- Yeah.</i>

37:21.539 --> 37:23.131
Marry me.

37:48.899 --> 37:50.237
Hey, mister.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.281
Goddamn it. Shit!

38:41.452 --> 38:43.343
Is that
what I think it is?

38:43.888 --> 38:45.150
Oh, the tattoo?

38:46.190 --> 38:48.300
Yeah. Tattoo.

38:49.160 --> 38:53.762
Yeah, I was in the, uh, L.A. Crash Unit
before I... got transferred up here.

38:54.799 --> 38:58.398
Guns blazing, ass-kicking cops
with porno moustaches?

38:58.398 --> 38:59.193
That Crash?

38:59.370 --> 39:01.234
Yeah, is that so hard
for you to believe?

39:01.972 --> 39:03.413
Yeah.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.038
Can I get in there?

39:07.712 --> 39:11.346
That's where I met Marina,
actually. She was my CI.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.547
You married your snitch?

39:14.385 --> 39:17.149
Dude, that is wrong
on so many levels.

39:17.321 --> 39:19.585
Well, she was
in really bad shape.

39:19.757 --> 39:23.386
Got in rehab and we fell in love
and there you go.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.997
Was she the only one
in rehab?

39:28.766 --> 39:30.956
That's ancient history.

39:31.235 --> 39:33.401
You sure
about that, Hoss?

39:33.904 --> 39:35.895
Listen, I got 10 days
to retirement.

39:36.073 --> 39:40.271
Full benefits for me and my family,
so why would I screw that up?

39:42.046 --> 39:43.411
It's all I got.

39:43.647 --> 39:45.086
All right. Let's go.

39:45.249 --> 39:46.716
How long you been clean?

39:47.351 --> 39:49.785
Since my son was born.

39:51.789 --> 39:53.450
Good for you.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.360
David, come on.

40:19.049 --> 40:20.983
David,
did you forget something?

40:21.218 --> 40:23.636
- You forgot my hug.
- Love you, mommy.

40:54.652 --> 40:56.359
Good job.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.386
Oh, my God.

41:32.623 --> 41:34.518
You can't do this.

41:40.898 --> 41:42.798
Why did you come?

41:45.369 --> 41:47.667
There's nothing
for you here.

41:53.143 --> 41:56.534
Why did you make me stop
coming to see you in prison?

41:59.483 --> 42:02.398
I didn't see any sense
of three wasted lives.

42:03.153 --> 42:04.780
Three?

42:05.990 --> 42:07.582
Was that him?

42:08.559 --> 42:10.239
The boy?

42:10.995 --> 42:12.326
David?

42:16.033 --> 42:17.295
You shouldn't think...

42:19.203 --> 42:21.314
Give did a dime.

42:21.739 --> 42:23.798
David's 8.
Do the math.

42:25.576 --> 42:28.770
When you cut me off,
I gave the baby up.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.911
Did you find a good family?

42:37.354 --> 42:39.976
I had an abortion.

42:43.594 --> 42:45.459
I'm sorry.

43:08.919 --> 43:10.571
All right.

43:18.796 --> 43:22.288
They know what you're doing.
I saw it on TV.

43:23.467 --> 43:26.073
I hope
you kill them all.

43:46.090 --> 43:47.887
Shall we begin?

43:56.184 --> 43:57.997
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

44:04.041 --> 44:06.061
Let's start a family.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.375
- Family?
- Yeah.

44:10.814 --> 44:12.838
What's gotten into you?

44:13.350 --> 44:15.151
We'll sell the house
by the lake,

44:15.151 --> 44:18.650
and, uh, we'll-we'll get a...
we'll get a Craftsman in Pasadena.

44:19.062 --> 44:20.483
Fresh start.

44:26.230 --> 44:29.235
You're serious about this,
aren't you?

44:32.503 --> 44:34.130
Yes.

44:35.305 --> 44:36.670
And what about your work?

44:37.007 --> 44:38.616
Oh, um...

44:39.810 --> 44:41.141
Well, what about it?

44:42.312 --> 44:45.804
- Would you quit before this job?
- Absolutely.

44:46.717 --> 44:50.894
- I will quit... absolutely.
- Just like that?

44:58.562 --> 45:00.655
Just like that.

45:04.568 --> 45:06.162
Marina.

45:06.904 --> 45:08.241
Listen, honey,
let me in just for a second,

45:08.241 --> 45:09.273
I need to talk to you.

45:09.473 --> 45:10.690
I'm gonna stand
out here all day

45:10.690 --> 45:12.579
if you don't let me in,
so you may as well do it.

45:13.477 --> 45:14.930
Marina.

45:16.780 --> 45:20.716
<i>... killed, the first victim
was gunned down less than an hour</i>

45:20.918 --> 45:23.785
<i>after the suspected gunman
was released from prison.</i>

45:23.987 --> 45:26.012
<i>While the second victim
was brutally shot...</i>

45:26.190 --> 45:27.657
What are you doing here?

45:27.825 --> 45:29.725
Thought you didn't care
about my case.

45:29.893 --> 45:32.555
<i>... to a bank robbery
at Bakersfield 10 years ago.</i>

45:32.987 --> 45:36.696
Look, I do not need you coming here
and dragging us down again.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.765
- Marina, if you just...
- No.

45:38.936 --> 45:40.870
I am getting
my associate's degree.

45:41.038 --> 45:43.917
I am tryin' to make something
better for Tommy and me.

45:44.508 --> 45:46.237
Please take me back.

45:46.443 --> 45:48.618
It'll-it'll be okay.

45:48.912 --> 45:51.506
- It's not okay.
- Marina, I'm beggin' ya.

45:51.715 --> 45:53.638
I'm-I'm beggin' you, please.

45:53.638 --> 45:55.629
God, what are you doin'?
Get off your knees.

45:55.664 --> 45:58.576
- Marina, please. Just please...
- Don't touch me!

45:58.943 --> 46:00.965
Do not touch me.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.917
- Give me the dope.
- I don't have any dope.

46:05.129 --> 46:06.878
Give it to me.

46:07.798 --> 46:11.290
Okay. Here.

46:12.236 --> 46:13.828
It's all I got.

46:14.404 --> 46:17.271
Look, I'll go to rehab.
I swear to God I will.

46:17.474 --> 46:19.169
Let's go.
Let's go right now.

46:19.409 --> 46:23.607
Well, after the case. I gotta finish the case.
Well, I can't just walk out on that.

46:23.814 --> 46:25.907
I just wanna be with you
for one night.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.278
I mean, you know,
with Tommy and...

46:28.752 --> 46:29.844
Please.

46:32.689 --> 46:34.712
Just one night.

46:47.504 --> 46:49.972
<i>Radio...
Twenty-five dollar gift cert...</i>

46:51.008 --> 46:52.669
<i>Brother,
put down that bottle.</i>

46:53.277 --> 46:56.440
<i>Put down that cocaine,
that methamphetamine.</i>

46:56.613 --> 47:01.983
<i>Put down that .45,
that .38 and that .357 Magnum.</i>

47:07.624 --> 47:10.320
<i>So precious
to each one of us.</i>

47:10.527 --> 47:11.804
<i>Why?</i>

47:13.897 --> 47:18.410
<i>The night is far gone,
the day is at hand.</i>

47:19.102 --> 47:23.402
<i>Those that live by the sword
will die by the sword,</i>

47:23.807 --> 47:26.936
<i>unless they learn
to forgive.</i>

47:27.411 --> 47:32.960
<i>God made life so fragile
and so precious for each one of us.</i>

47:34.151 --> 47:39.248
<i>You will never truly be free
unless you learn to...</i>

47:40.624 --> 47:43.331
Yo, I gotta take a leak.
I'll be right back.

47:52.436 --> 47:55.354
Hold on, big man,
I gotta check you. Arms up.

48:13.678 --> 48:16.086
You got any weapons on you
besides these guns right here?

48:16.564 --> 48:19.340
I'm only kiddin', man.
Go on, have a good time.

48:20.530 --> 48:22.293
Welcome
to the gentlemen's club.

48:22.466 --> 48:24.559
It's a two-drink minimum
tonight, baby.

48:31.975 --> 48:33.522
My man.

48:34.811 --> 48:37.371
Hey, what's up,
big dog?

48:39.283 --> 48:41.114
I'm great.

48:43.420 --> 48:45.088
Right.

48:54.264 --> 48:56.184
- Wake up, Joe.
- Huh?

49:39.643 --> 49:41.941
I've been expecting you.

49:43.747 --> 49:45.049
Joe.

49:46.850 --> 49:48.340
- Joe.
- Huh?

49:49.353 --> 49:51.981
Oh, Shelly.

49:52.464 --> 49:54.369
Go outside
and watch the door.

49:56.126 --> 49:58.560
Only one of us
is gonna make it out of here.

49:59.463 --> 50:04.157
No matter who it is, Joe,
you didn't see a damn thing.

50:05.902 --> 50:07.665
Go on.

50:42.672 --> 50:44.162
All right, then.

51:34.357 --> 51:36.052
I got a son.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.930
Tell him
I said I'm sorry.

51:46.503 --> 51:48.321
I'm begging you.

51:57.681 --> 52:00.309
He's speed dial
number three.

52:04.488 --> 52:08.447
I'm sorry.
He made us take you down.

52:30.847 --> 52:34.617
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

52:34.818 --> 52:36.285
Your father's sorry.

52:36.623 --> 52:40.340
<i>Who is this?
Is he okay?</i>

52:40.857 --> 52:43.052
<i>Did something happen?</i>

52:43.226 --> 52:44.335
Yeah.

52:45.795 --> 52:47.922
Something happened.

53:58.034 --> 54:00.502
I thought you said
you were done.

54:03.707 --> 54:05.538
I have to finish
this one first, baby.

54:05.742 --> 54:10.298
- You promised me you were quitting.
- And I will. I will quit.

54:12.782 --> 54:17.774
- But after this one.
- No, this isn't fair.

54:18.255 --> 54:20.246
I didn't ask you
to marry me.

54:20.548 --> 54:22.618
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

54:22.826 --> 54:24.080
Mm-hm.

54:24.561 --> 54:28.051
- What if I told you you had to choose?
- Don't do that!

54:30.433 --> 54:33.554
You used to be attracted...
to what I do.

54:34.804 --> 54:36.431
I'm your wife now.

54:38.642 --> 54:41.231
- What if he kills you?
- Lily!

54:55.825 --> 55:00.285
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

55:00.664 --> 55:04.963
I know I suck at baseball.
You don't have to pretend like I'm good.

55:09.773 --> 55:14.273
You'll get better.
You just need to practice.

55:14.577 --> 55:17.965
Maybe you and I can throw
the ball around one day. How's that?

55:18.214 --> 55:19.230
Okay.

55:19.230 --> 55:21.596
I gotta tell you
a secret first, though.

55:21.631 --> 55:25.615
- What, daddy?
- I suck at baseball too.

55:31.995 --> 55:36.125
You go to sleep, okay?
I'll be back.

55:41.871 --> 55:43.168
Jesus Christ.

55:44.641 --> 55:46.336
Oh, Jesus.

55:46.543 --> 55:50.193
You okay? Look at me, look at me.
Why did you do this?

55:50.347 --> 55:51.837
I'm afraid.

55:52.615 --> 55:54.812
What are you afraid of,
honey?

55:55.251 --> 55:58.687
We're going to hell
for what we did.

56:00.156 --> 56:02.056
Do you know
what hell is?

56:02.892 --> 56:05.622
It's not fire and devils.

56:06.129 --> 56:09.155
All that stuff they taught you
when you was little.

56:10.734 --> 56:15.467
We make our heaven
and our hell while we're alive,

56:17.707 --> 56:21.281
every time we cause pain,

56:22.779 --> 56:26.180
every time
we cause suffering.

57:35.492 --> 57:36.086
<i>Cicero.</i>

57:36.086 --> 57:37.956
Hey, it's me.
Did I wake you up?

57:38.655 --> 57:39.509
No.

57:39.565 --> 57:42.661
You said, uh, on your message
to give you a call, so...

57:43.092 --> 57:44.753
Okay, here's the deal.

57:45.016 --> 57:48.228
Both of our victims...
were informants.

57:48.298 --> 57:51.049
- Could be something there, right?
- Yeah, it could be.

57:52.168 --> 57:53.396
Nice work.

57:53.570 --> 57:55.162
Okay, I need you
to follow up on it.

57:55.338 --> 57:56.435
I gotta be
in court all day,

57:56.435 --> 57:58.828
but I really think
we're getting close on this thing.

57:58.828 --> 58:01.920
<i>It's gotta have something to do
with how they got set up. The ambush.</i>

58:03.980 --> 58:06.802
Hey, did you hear about
that stabbing in Henderson last night?

58:07.050 --> 58:10.816
- Yeah, yeah, what-what about it?
- Well, I got a hunch it might be our guy.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.955
It's not his M.O. No.
Our guy's a shooter, not a stabber.

58:14.123 --> 58:16.990
- Well, like I said, I got a hunch.
- Yeah, so did Quasimodo.

58:17.160 --> 58:20.145
- Look where it got him.
- I'm just gonna go ask a few questions.

58:20.530 --> 58:22.395
After you do
the follow-up, right?

58:22.565 --> 58:24.359
I already got it cleared
with the Henderson IC.

58:24.359 --> 58:25.652
I'm headed
up there now.

58:25.794 --> 58:30.536
Hey, listen. I have to be in court all day.
I am asking you to do this. It's my case.

58:40.350 --> 58:43.917
<i>... bring us nothing
but the same politics as usual.</i>

58:43.952 --> 58:45.993
<i>I have fought
to keep government honest,</i>

58:46.089 --> 58:48.353
<i>save you money
and to lower your taxes.</i>

58:48.525 --> 58:51.085
<i>Above all, I will be
someone who listens to you.</i>

58:51.294 --> 58:54.422
<i>The choice is simple,
vote Margie Pageant.</i>

58:54.664 --> 58:57.870
<i>In local news, a Henderson man
is fighting for his life this morning</i>

58:58.001 --> 59:00.936
<i>after being brutally attacked
at a local gentlemen's club.</i>

59:01.141 --> 59:03.434
<i>The man is suffering
from multiple stab wounds.</i>

59:03.506 --> 59:06.942
<i>Doctors at Clark County Medical Center
describe his condition as critical.</i>

59:07.110 --> 59:08.648
<i>Hello?</i>

59:19.889 --> 59:21.201
- Sponge.
- Sponge.

59:32.368 --> 59:34.859
<i>We think he'll be heading
back to Nevado. What's your position?</i>

59:35.038 --> 59:37.939
- Tehachapi.
- Try the hospital in Clark County.

59:38.441 --> 59:40.876
<i>His third victim survived
the hit last night.</i>

59:40.876 --> 59:43.141
<i>He'll be wantin'
to finish the job.</i>

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:01.988
Where are you?

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:28.471
Good night.

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.399
Doctor!

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:25.873
What the hell is that?

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:33.812
- Back in the room, back in the room.
- Police officer, get back.

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:38.114
- Police.
- He went that way.

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:42.743
- I'm a cop. Where'd he go?
- He went downstairs, officer.

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:19.647
<i>How do you have
my dad's phone?</i>

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:22.354
He asked me
to call you.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.755
<i>Are you the one
who killed 'im?</i>

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.219
Yes.

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:29.389
<i>I'm gonna find you
and I'm gonna kill you.</i>

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.804
Do what you need to do.

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:39.872
But you better be sure,

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:43.057
cause it's a long, dark road
you're headed down.

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:44.189
I lost him.

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:45.800
<i>Client wants
to pull the job.</i>

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:48.528
No. No way, no way.
You-you tell him to back off.

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:52.498
- That I've got this under control. All right?
- You're running out of time.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:38.349
- Where's the old man?
- Dead.

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.546
- Don't lie to me.
- I'll show you the damn grave.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.118
- How long ago?
- I don't know.

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:47.306
Three or four years.

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:56.067
Hold still.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.743
Okay.

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:27.002
- How long you been out?
- Couple o' days.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.466
And why are you here?

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:33.673
Came here
to kill the old man.

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.434
Why?

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:39.304
Cause he set us up.

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:42.582
What makes you
think that?

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:46.743
Gary went to 'im for advice on
the bank job and he wanted full share.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.379
Gary wouldn't give it
to 'im.

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:54.680
So, do you... do you think the old man
was capable of murdering his own son?

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.098
- Yeah.
- No.

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:01.130
Mm-mm.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:02.888
Nope.

01:09:04.506 --> 01:09:06.167
He couldn't have.

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:08.604
What makes you so sure?

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:14.506
I just... I just know.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.777
Tell me.

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:20.618
Say it.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:25.292
Mom.

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.526
Because...

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:32.957
he loved your brother
too much.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.468
I'm sorry.

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:42.500
And that's the truth
and that's not your fault.

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:45.169
It wasn't like
I could pretend you were his.

01:09:47.448 --> 01:09:50.350
He was reminded of that
every time he looked at you.

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:57.388
You never stood a chance.

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:07.303
Sorry... that I couldn't...
That I didn't... protect you.

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:11.363
The beatings and...

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:19.713
Gary was the only one
who ever cared for me.

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:21.644
Why'd he pull you in
on that bank job?

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:23.580
You were never a part
of what they did.

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:25.913
When his driver fell out,
I volunteered.

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:27.193
Why?

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:30.984
He owed the wrong people
a lot o' money.

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:34.428
And he needed me.

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:52.080
If it wasn't the old man,
then who set us up?

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:50.628
<i>Driven by his passions
and desires.</i>

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:55.573
<i>You will never truly be free
unless you freely forgive.</i>

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:58.269
<i>Hate is like a chain
around your neck</i>

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:01.712
<i>that leads you to places
you don't wanna go.</i>

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:05.376
<i>It'll lead you into darkness
and desolation.</i>

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:07.953
<i>You become a slave
to that hatred,</i>

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:10.990
<i>and it'll only lead
to your own destruction.</i>

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.185
<i>You must break free.</i>

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:29.500
- Hey, cowboy.
- You okay, man?

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.737
- Yeah.
- You laid eyes on him at least.

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:33.541
- Hey, well done.
- Thanks, man.

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:34.977
I gotta call you back.

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:37.128
Still in one piece.
Good job.

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:40.178
Good lead, cowboy.
You almost got 'im.

01:12:40.473 --> 01:12:42.004
- Well, we got close.
- Yeah.

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:55.068
It was a good hunch.

01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:58.569
Well, even Quasimodo
has his day.

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:02.905
- And don't ever hang up on me again.
- Roger that.

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:08.512
I hate to spoil your moment, but, uh,
I got something I wanna show you.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:12.172
- I think we may have caught a break.
- You said "we" again.

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.379
I did.

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:20.551
Our latest victim...
was a CI too.

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:21.787
So all three are informants.

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:25.092
Mm-hm. They've all got records,
armed robbery, rape, assault.

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:27.167
But none of them
did any serious time.

01:13:27.642 --> 01:13:30.525
They all snitched their way
out of the joint over and over.

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:33.468
- What are the odds of that?
- Slim and none.

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:35.929
I'm waiting on
the informant logs now.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:37.164
Who are these guys here?

01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:39.432
Former accomplices
of the first three victims.

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:42.679
Let's split them up,
check them out, huh? I'll take these guys.

01:13:42.679 --> 01:13:47.555
<i>I know there's not a man,
woman or child in this church today</i>

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:50.522
<i>that has not sinned.</i>

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:55.920
<i>But God did not bring you down
on this Earth to be perfect. No.</i>

01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:59.867
<i>God wants you down here
to be saved.</i>

01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:05.968
<i>And when you're down with God,
God is eternally down with you.</i>

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:26.952
<i>When Jesus knew that his time was near,
when He knew that he was gonna die,</i>

01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:31.156
<i>when He knew they would not take
that cup away from his lips,</i>

01:14:31.517 --> 01:14:33.871
<i>his thoughts were not
upon His own.</i>

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:37.113
<i>His thoughts were
for those that He loved.</i>

01:14:37.113 --> 01:14:38.765
<i>- Amen.
- That's right.</i>

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:42.137
<i>His thoughts were for those
that He loved, preparing them.</i>

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:46.304
<i>Why is that?
He used the example of His birth.</i>

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:49.508
That's right. Here it is.
Jesus told them how a woman

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:53.037
goes through pain and sorrow
in the throes of childbirth.

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:58.016
But then as soon as she has delivered,
there is no more anguish.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:06.157
After all the screamin',
after all the pushin',

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.168
after all the blood
and the tears,

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:12.169
there's only joy that
a new child has been born.

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:13.864
Hallelujah!

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:16.977
- And I'll tell you my...
- Amen! Amen!

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:21.346
Amen.

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:29.983
Amen. Amen. Amen.

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:37.531
- Hallelujah!
- Amen!

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:40.709
- Amen!
- Sing me a song!

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:06.635
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:15.703
You've been the subject of many
of my sermons these past few days.

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:17.869
I heard.

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:23.843
You heard.
But did you listen?

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:27.448
Everything okay,
baby?

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:32.819
Everything's just fine,
honey.

01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:37.757
I was just... catching up with a...
an old acquaintance.

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.459
You go on home now.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:04.077
Let's take a walk.

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:24.687
- Was that your son?
- Adopted.

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:28.481
One of five.
Wayward boys.

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:31.936
Not unlike me or you
at that age.

01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:35.083
You turned your life around.

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:38.152
Doesn't change
what you did.

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:41.833
I wouldn't want it to.

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:44.045
I know it sounds cold,

01:17:44.747 --> 01:17:47.553
every good I've done
hinged on the evil I did that day.

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:50.994
- Who set us up?
- I don't know.

01:17:51.296 --> 01:17:54.533
I never did find out how
they knew about your safe house.

01:17:55.028 --> 01:17:59.085
When I got the call...
"Easy money", they said.

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:04.280
All I had to do was guard
the door, be the lookout.

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:09.141
I was in a dark place
in my life.

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:12.358
- Numb to the chaos and...
- Right here.

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:16.482
But when they cut
that boy's throat...

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:20.093
<i>Oh, Jesus, man. No!</i>

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:30.758
That boy they killed...
was my brother.

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:39.645
I can't bring 'im back.
And in my heart, I'm sorry.

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:46.541
I still took my cut,
spent it on drugs and women.

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:49.356
Ended up in prison.

01:18:51.175 --> 01:18:54.380
But it was there
that I found my callin'.

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:59.721
To save and help
boys... like me.

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:02.239
And like you.

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:05.664
It was there
that I gave my life to God.

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:09.092
God can't save you
from me.

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:15.390
But maybe He could
save you from yourself.

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:18.215
- I know there's good...
- You don't know me.

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:20.752
I know the devil
got your heart twisted

01:19:21.192 --> 01:19:23.167
with vengeance
and hate.

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:27.610
The Lord is merciful.
He sees in your soul.

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:36.686
Fragile, ain't it?

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:43.907
That moment, that sets us
on our road to Damascus.

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:46.953
Sermon's over.

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:56.183
Can you at least find it in your heart
to forgive me for what I did?

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:01.088
I can't.

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:11.936
That's all right.

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:16.205
That's all right.

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:21.828
Because I forgive you
for what you're about to do.

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:58.347
Lord, see into this man's heart.
He's good inside.

01:20:58.632 --> 01:21:00.579
Oh, Lord,
save this man's soul.

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:02.655
I know
you see his heart.

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:14.363
Release him from the bondage
of hatred and vengeance, Lord.

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:42.159
Go back
to your family.

01:22:57.672 --> 01:23:00.163
That's one hell of a peashooter
you got there.

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:03.005
How's the recoil?

01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:34.136
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:38.016
<i>Inyo County at the reservoir.
They're here. Both of them.</i>

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:41.310
What?
Did you call for backup?

01:23:41.719 --> 01:23:44.497
- There is no time for that.
- Okay, don't do this.

01:23:44.497 --> 01:23:46.411
Look, detective, I'm sorry
I keep stepping on your case.

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:49.580
<i>- Look, I don't care about that.
- I want you to do me a favor, will you?</i>

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:51.440
If I don't make it
out of this,

01:23:52.479 --> 01:23:54.857
tell my son that his daddy
went out like a man, will you?

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:57.863
I am on my way.
Please, just wait for me.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:23:59.728
I'm just goin'
with the flow, baby.

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.529
Damn!

01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:13.507
Well, aren't you gonna
reach for it?

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:19.081
Come on.
Sporting chance.

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.815
I've got nothing
against you.

01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:25.941
I've been trying to kill you
for the past three days

01:24:25.941 --> 01:24:28.564
and you've got nothing
against me?

01:24:29.426 --> 01:24:32.941
So, I'm starting to think you don't
take me very seriously, my friend.

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:37.261
What do you want from me?

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:39.930
How about a little respect? Hey?

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:42.599
A little professional courtesy
from a peer.

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:45.612
You know, some acknowledgment
of my skills.

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:49.580
You've got issues.

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:56.221
Screw... you.

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:10.195
I win.

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:24.347
You think you're done!

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:28.802
You can't put it together,
can you?

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:33.587
There must be one more.

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:41.100
The one who hired me.

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:45.003
He's still alive.

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:50.842
<i>I'm gonna kill you all.</i>

01:25:57.852 --> 01:25:59.482
Drop the gun.

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:03.301
Don't move.
Slowly...

01:26:03.858 --> 01:26:05.189
Put the gun down.

01:26:07.195 --> 01:26:09.129
- No.
- Put the goddamn gun down!

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.491
No! This is my job!

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:14.793
I finish my job.

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:17.275
Well, how you gonna finish this
when you're dead?

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:12.216
So, you're the guy
that hired me.

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:18.390
You shouldn't
have done that.

01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:21.558
I had to finish
what I started.

01:27:23.304 --> 01:27:24.794
Why'd you hire me then?

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.932
I didn't think
I was up to it.

01:27:28.479 --> 01:27:31.476
After you missed him at the apartment,
I figured I should get involved

01:27:31.806 --> 01:27:34.084
before he came
gunning for me.

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.887
He didn't even know
about you.

01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:43.516
I figured that out when
he didn't finish me off at the hospital.

01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:49.319
His brother's girlfriend
was my informant down in L.A.

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:52.056
She told me
about the bank job.

01:27:52.091 --> 01:27:54.332
Hired some more of my informants
down there.

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:56.766
They helped me take down
their score.

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:05.514
- So, what now?
- Now?

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:09.948
I ride off into the sunset.

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:20.802
Hey!

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:24.295
I forgot to pay you.

01:28:26.275 --> 01:28:27.494
You know,
I don't get you.

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:31.177
Why do you put yourself through
all this shit for one lousy dollar?

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:35.185
It's my price.
Call it a hobby.

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.471
You know what?
Keep it.

01:28:38.179 --> 01:28:39.703
I didn't earn it.

01:28:39.974 --> 01:28:42.441
Don't contact me again,
I'm done.

01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:45.420
Yeah, me too.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.346
<i>Detective Cicero?</i>

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:49.683
Yeah, I can't reach 'im.

01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:51.654
<i>Okay. Well,
hopefully he'll turn up.</i>

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:54.487
<i>We've got units en route,
we'll see you shortly.</i>

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:58.148
Wait a minute.

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:04.565
You didn't flip him this case,
did you?

01:29:05.433 --> 01:29:06.704
No, I didn't flip 'im
the case.

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:08.341
<i>Is that what you thought?</i>

01:29:08.545 --> 01:29:11.780
- He asked for it, right?
- He begged for it.

01:29:11.815 --> 01:29:14.479
<i>And I felt sorry for 'im,
so I caved.</i>

01:29:14.912 --> 01:29:17.311
Is there a reason why
we're talking about this right now?

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:22.720
- No. No reason.
- Okay, I'll see you shortly.

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:26.848
"Go with the flow", my ass.

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:33.530
Marina? Hey, it's me, honey.
Well, I got 'im, I closed the case.

01:29:34.052 --> 01:29:35.493
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:39.667
As a matter of fact...
I feel perfect.

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:42.102
- Better than I ever have.
- Yeah?

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:46.232
Yeah. And I'm gonna
get rid of the other stuff too.

01:29:46.267 --> 01:29:48.334
Don't you worry,
I promise.

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:51.181
I'll be home
in a couple o' hours.

01:29:51.856 --> 01:29:55.417
Listen, uh... You're not gonna
believe this.

01:29:56.583 --> 01:30:00.181
I've been reading up on women,
and I think I got you figured out.

01:30:01.529 --> 01:30:03.588
We're gonna be fine.

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:07.157
Yeah, honey, it's over.

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:12.652
I wanna start brand-new,
honey.

01:30:36.497 --> 01:30:38.226
How?

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:43.937
Metal plate.

01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:55.342
I can't feel anything.

01:31:00.988 --> 01:31:03.456
I created my own hell.

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:12.291
And I'm the demon
who crawled up out of it.

01:31:44.827 --> 01:31:45.856
<i>- Hello?
- Baby.</i>

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.057
Baby.

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:50.363
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm coming home.</i>

01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:23.895
Today, I wanna talk to you...
about forgiveness.
