08:00.730 --> 08:02.816
but she calls me in sick anyway.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.525
So then how'd

08:02.857 --> 08:04.525
you go to the concert?

08:04.567 --> 08:06.236
Tut-tut-tut.

08:06.278 --> 08:09.156
Here comes the genius

08:06.278 --> 08:09.156
of your Uncle J.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.909
What I did was ten minutes later

08:12.951 --> 08:15.787
I convinced my mom

08:12.951 --> 08:15.787
that I'm all better

08:15.829 --> 08:18.581
so she sends me to school.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.376
And since she already

08:18.623 --> 08:21.376
called the school..

08:21.418 --> 08:23.086
They weren't expecting me.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.672
...and you were free

08:23.128 --> 08:25.672
to get the autograph

08:25.713 --> 08:28.549
I mean, go to the concert.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.759
Thanks, Uncle Jesse.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.012
Sure. Anyway,

08:29.801 --> 08:32.012
after the concert..

08:32.053 --> 08:34.389
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:34.431 --> 08:36.475
What is this? That's-that's

08:34.431 --> 08:36.475
the end of the interview?

08:36.516 --> 08:40.687
Oh. Uh, no. Uh, what's

08:36.516 --> 08:40.687
your favorite color?

08:40.728 --> 08:41.813
Black.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.106

09:42.999 --> 09:44.418
I'll get Joey.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.921
You just need some

09:44.459 --> 09:47.921
peace and quiet.

Joey, get in here!

10:02.936 --> 10:05.272
D.J., you're burning up.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.983
You have a fever. 101.

10:09.025 --> 10:12.362
A 101? Let me see.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.822
D.J., your hands

10:12.404 --> 10:14.822
feel like icicles.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.659
They do.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.121
But, Joey, I have

10:18.701 --> 10:21.121
to go to school today.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.624
There's a big test

10:21.162 --> 10:24.624
on C-C-Canada.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.128
You want to go to school?

10:28.169 --> 10:31.005
You must be really sick.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.757
I'm calling school right now.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.842
Oh-h-h.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.013
I am so rad.

Michelle, you're doing

10:41.849 --> 10:44.018
a great job.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.814
Yeah. Tomorrow I'm going

10:45.562 --> 10:47.814
to show you how to vacuum.

Hi, Joey.

10:50.942 --> 10:51.985

My hands are warm,

10:53.778 --> 10:54.779

How can that possibly be?

It's a miracle.

No, the miracle would be

11:14.007 --> 11:16.384
is if I fell for this.

It's pretty obvious to me,

11:26.311 --> 11:28.771
you felt so guilty

11:28.813 --> 11:30.940
about getting out of that test

with that phony sick bit

11:30.982 --> 11:34.402

11:30.982 --> 11:34.402
and decided to go to school.

That's exactly right.

See, when I was

15:52.368 --> 15:54.871

15:54.913 --> 15:56.581
my dad showed me no mercy.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.708
In fact, he took

15:56.623 --> 15:58.708
so many privileges away

that to this day

15:58.750 --> 16:00.585
when I go visit my parents

16:00.627 --> 16:03.630
I gotta go straight

16:00.627 --> 16:03.630
to my room, no TV, no dinner.

16:04.839 --> 16:05.840
Well, whenever I was bad

16:05.882 --> 16:07.258
my dad would sit me down

16:07.300 --> 16:09.385
talk about right

16:07.300 --> 16:09.385
and wrong and good and bad

16:09.427 --> 16:11.596
for hours and hours on and on

16:11.638 --> 16:14.766
until finally I beat

16:11.638 --> 16:14.766
the hell out of myself.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.352
The worst part,

16:16.684 --> 16:18.352
though, the worst part

16:18.394 --> 16:20.563
was when my dad

16:18.394 --> 16:20.563
gave me the dad face.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.441
You know, it was like like this.

Ooh. The dad face.

I'm really sorry.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.129
I totally blew it.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.675

16:45.171 --> 16:48.675
like this again.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.761
Regardless...but

16:48.716 --> 16:51.761
Joseph and I must deal

16:51.803 --> 16:54.555
with your misconduct,

16:51.803 --> 16:54.555
young lady.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.890
Misconduct?

16:56.808 --> 16:58.184
Young lady?

16:59.352 --> 17:02.021
I really am

16:59.352 --> 17:02.021
turning into my father.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.566
If I start wearing

17:03.523 --> 17:05.566
a while belt and shoes to match

17:05.608 --> 17:07.861
throw me down

17:05.608 --> 17:07.861
the stairs, will you?

17:08.695 --> 17:09.988
I'd be honored.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.406
D.J., we're going

17:10.029 --> 17:12.406
to have to punish you.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.201
So no TV for two weeks.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.995
What you call

17:15.242 --> 17:16.995
that punishment?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.998
No TV, no music

17:17.036 --> 17:19.998
for two weeks.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.793
Oh, yeah? I see your no TV

17:20.039 --> 17:23.793
and no music for two weeks

17:23.835 --> 17:27.087
and I raise you,

17:23.835 --> 17:27.087
no friends over for a month.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.799
I call.

17:29.841 --> 17:32.593
No TV, music and no friends

17:29.841 --> 17:32.593
over for a month.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.929
Are we agreed, young lady?

17:34.971 --> 17:37.557
Sure. I deserve to be punished.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.601
Dad trusted me

17:37.598 --> 17:40.601
and I let him down.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.562
I hate myself.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.649
Excuse us.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.319
Listen, man, I think

17:48.275 --> 17:50.319
the kid is sorry.

17:50.361 --> 17:51.946
I mean, she's been punished

17:51.988 --> 17:54.949
I think when

17:51.988 --> 17:54.949
Danny comes back from LA

17:54.991 --> 17:57.243
maybe we shouldn't

17:54.991 --> 17:57.243
tell him about this.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.286
Don't you think he has a right

17:57.284 --> 17:59.286
to know exactly what happened?

17:59.328 --> 18:00.705
Yes, I do, but I don't

17:59.328 --> 18:00.705
want him to think

18:00.747 --> 18:02.206
we can't take care of the girls.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.333
You're absolutely right.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.333
I forgot about that.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.752
He may never

18:04.375 --> 18:05.752
want to leave the house again.

18:05.793 --> 18:06.836
Now you're thinkin'.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.629
Alright, D.J.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.382
we're not going

18:08.671 --> 18:11.382
to tell your dad what happened.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.467
Well, alright.

18:13.509 --> 18:17.638
Oh, thank you,

18:13.509 --> 18:17.638
thank you, thank you.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.433
"The bunny and the ducky

18:17.680 --> 18:20.433
and the turtle and the frog

18:20.474 --> 18:22.560
"all rode home on a rainbow

18:22.602 --> 18:25.145
"and smiled for

18:22.602 --> 18:25.145
the rest of their lives."

18:25.980 --> 18:27.189
I love this story.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.191
- Yeah. See?

18:27.231 --> 18:29.191
- Uh.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.359
Yeah.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.658
Cowabunga, dudes!

18:37.700 --> 18:38.826
Hi, dad.

18:38.868 --> 18:39.994
- 'Hey, Danny.'

18:38.868 --> 18:39.994
- 'Hey!'

18:40.036 --> 18:42.789
Aw, I missed

18:40.036 --> 18:42.789
my little dudettes.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.085
Let me dudette again.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.838
LA claims another victim.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.966
[laughing]

18:50.880 --> 18:52.966
How did everything go here?

18:53.007 --> 18:55.676
- 'Good.'

18:53.007 --> 18:55.676
- Great. Yeah. It's fine.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.219
Hi, daddy!

18:57.261 --> 18:58.387
Hi.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.766
D.J., you look so much better.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.438
You look so much better?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.357
Um...yeah. I got my hair done.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.319
You got gypped.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.782
I thought you were sick.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.701
Right. Sick of this hairstyle.

19:20.743 --> 19:21.786
That's good.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.580
Steph, walk with me.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.580
Talk with me.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.207
[clears throat]

19:24.622 --> 19:27.207
Listen, how 'bout

19:24.622 --> 19:27.207
if we play a little game

19:27.249 --> 19:29.627
entitled let's not

19:27.249 --> 19:29.627
talk about D.J., okay?

19:29.669 --> 19:30.670
- Okay.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.670
- Good.

19:30.711 --> 19:31.879
Anybody want to play

19:31.921 --> 19:33.881
Let's not talk about D.J?

19:35.257 --> 19:36.843
See? Now you've lost the game.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.470
Your punishment is

19:38.177 --> 19:39.470
that you have to go into

19:39.512 --> 19:42.807
the kitchen and,

19:39.512 --> 19:42.807
um, and cook us dinner.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.391
I don't know how to cook.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.268
Polish the silver.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.563
Why are we not

19:47.394 --> 19:49.563
talking about D.J?

19:50.648 --> 19:53.026
Was D.J. sick this morning?

19:53.067 --> 19:54.944
Well, she was a little

19:53.067 --> 19:54.944
under the weather.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.030
But, uh, we got

19:54.986 --> 19:57.030
her right back up on her feet

19:57.071 --> 19:58.698
and shipped her

19:57.071 --> 19:58.698
right back off to school.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.741
Exactly, see, it was hardly

19:58.739 --> 20:00.741
worth mentioning

20:00.783 --> 20:04.078
so we didn't mention it,

20:00.783 --> 20:04.078
everything is great.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.329
Oh. Well, good.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.540
D.J., since you missed

20:05.371 --> 20:07.540
school today

20:07.581 --> 20:11.002
your teacher asked me to

20:07.581 --> 20:11.002
give you your homework.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.514
Thank you so much.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.308
You're welcome.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.436
(Joey)

20:26.350 --> 20:29.436
'Ooh, now, see, that's

20:26.350 --> 20:29.436
a good dad face right there.'

20:31.647 --> 20:33.524
[sighs]

20:31.647 --> 20:33.524
Donna Jo?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.069
I tricked Uncle Jesse

20:36.110 --> 20:37.737
into teaching

20:36.110 --> 20:37.737
me how to fool Joey

20:37.778 --> 20:39.113
into thinking I was sick

20:39.155 --> 20:41.866
so I could cut school

20:39.155 --> 20:41.866
to get that autograph.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.452
But then Michelle busted

20:41.908 --> 20:45.452
me and Joey took me home..

20:45.494 --> 20:47.205
...on a leash.

20:48.330 --> 20:52.877
You liar! You made

20:48.330 --> 20:52.877
me a liar, too.

20:52.919 --> 20:56.714
I lied to Joey, to your

20:52.919 --> 20:56.714
teacher and everybody.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.258
I thought I knew you,

20:56.756 --> 20:59.258
but I don't.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.512
I share my rinse cup

21:00.467 --> 21:03.512
with a stranger.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.347
Stephanie.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.725
I even made you a get-well card.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.353
Here. Get well.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.567
D.J., go wait for me upstairs.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.569
You know, Joey, I starting

21:16.609 --> 21:18.569
to feel a little hungry.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.863
- Yeah, me, too.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.863
- Guys, come back here.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.365
- Actually, I'm not that hungry.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.365
- No, me, either.

21:25.118 --> 21:28.037
I want to know everything that

21:25.118 --> 21:28.037
goes on in my daughters' lives.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.747
Look, I don't expect

21:28.079 --> 21:29.747
you to be perfect parents

21:29.789 --> 21:31.916
but I do expect

21:29.789 --> 21:31.916
you to be honest.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.210
I don't know why,

21:31.958 --> 21:34.210
I don't know why

21:34.252 --> 21:36.754
I don't know why I'm wagging

21:34.252 --> 21:36.754
my finger at you like this.

21:39.257 --> 21:42.593
Look, I don't want

21:39.257 --> 21:42.593
to lecture you guys.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.263
I'd be lost here without you.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.140
But did you have to lie to me?

21:47.181 --> 21:48.975
We just didn't want you to think

21:47.181 --> 21:48.975
that we couldn't handle things

21:49.016 --> 21:50.017
while you were gone.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.060
Yeah, see, we wanted you to know

21:51.102 --> 21:52.061
you could go away and everything

21:52.103 --> 21:53.687
would be cool with your kids.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.939
(Joey)

21:53.729 --> 21:54.939
'And if there's ever a problem'

21:54.981 --> 21:56.732
we should get it

21:54.981 --> 21:56.732
right out in the open.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.735
That's right that we should work

21:56.774 --> 21:59.735
things out together as a family.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.362
In fact, Joey,

21:59.777 --> 22:02.362
say you're sorry and mean it.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.990
I'm sorry. Now you say it.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.950
- Okay. I'm sorry. Okay?

22:04.031 --> 22:05.950
- Okay.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.660
Thanks for the talk.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.788
Steph, what are you doing?

22:10.830 --> 22:13.040
I'm making a get sick card.

22:14.541 --> 22:16.169
I said I was sorry.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.297
Uh-oh. Lecture time.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.714
See ya.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.217
Steph, I think you should stay.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.261
Why do I get a lecture?

22:25.303 --> 22:27.263
I didn't do anything.

22:27.305 --> 22:29.974
But you will,

22:27.305 --> 22:29.974
so take accurate notes.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.103
D.J., come over here.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.233
Why did you do

22:36.438 --> 22:39.233
what you did today?

22:39.275 --> 22:42.569
Because I wanted that autograph

22:39.275 --> 22:42.569
more than anything.

22:44.113 --> 22:47.158
Do you know what the worst part

22:44.113 --> 22:47.158
is about what you did?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.993
That I cut school?

22:49.035 --> 22:50.703
No.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.247
That you tricked Stephanie?

22:55.499 --> 22:58.460
[sighs]

22:55.499 --> 22:58.460
That you were selfish.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.214
All you cared about was D.J.

23:01.255 --> 23:05.176
You did whatever you had to do

23:01.255 --> 23:05.176
to get D.J. what she wanted.

23:05.218 --> 23:08.554
Even if it meant lying

23:05.218 --> 23:08.554
and hurting other people.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.474
I don't wanna be selfish

23:12.516 --> 23:15.686
and I don't wanna hurt

23:12.516 --> 23:15.686
other people's feelings.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.395
I know you don't.

23:17.437 --> 23:20.358
I-I think you really care

23:17.437 --> 23:20.358
about other people.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.402
I'm really sorry, dad.

23:25.863 --> 23:29.242
Well, I know next time

23:25.863 --> 23:29.242
you'll think things through

23:29.283 --> 23:31.077
a lot more carefully

23:31.118 --> 23:34.121
'cause you're a lot better

23:31.118 --> 23:34.121
than what I saw today.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.167
Come here.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.462
Daddy, am I your favorite now?

23:45.423 --> 23:47.009
- Yes.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.009
- Hey!

23:47.051 --> 23:50.596
[laughing]

23:47.051 --> 23:50.596
No, no, no.

23:50.637 --> 23:51.722
No matter what happens

23:51.764 --> 23:52.765
I'm always gonna love all

23:52.806 --> 23:55.268
three of you exactly the same.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.061
Oh, alright.

23:58.604 --> 24:01.648
[chuckles]

23:58.604 --> 24:01.648
I wish Michelle was here.

24:01.690 --> 24:02.900
I like her the best.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.442
- H-hey!

24:02.942 --> 24:04.442
- Hey!
