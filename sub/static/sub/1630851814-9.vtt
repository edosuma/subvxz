00:50.800 --> 00:53.136
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.219 --> 00:55.722
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

00:56.431 --> 00:59.809
PREVIOUSLY

01:01.978 --> 01:03.146
<i>Master Yo-han…</i>

01:05.231 --> 01:06.983
<i>was an abandoned child.</i>

01:08.151 --> 01:09.944
<i>He was a child whom no one wanted.</i>

01:11.988 --> 01:14.157
<i>Some humans are born as monsters.</i>

01:17.994 --> 01:20.205
<i>And some of them use revenge as an excuse</i>

01:20.288 --> 01:22.373
<i>so that they can hunt
for pure entertainment.</i>

01:23.792 --> 01:25.502
<i>The dreadful past two years…</i>

01:27.003 --> 01:29.839
<i>Arson, terror…</i>

01:29.923 --> 01:31.674
<i>Let's now put it all behind us.</i>

01:31.758 --> 01:34.761
<i>The strong judicial reforms that
I have rolled out will soon begin.</i>

01:35.512 --> 01:38.306
<i>There are controversy on </i>Live Cour Show<i>.</i>

01:38.389 --> 01:39.808
<i>Who is socially disadvantaged?</i>

01:40.975 --> 01:43.269
<i>I will exercise jurisdiction
entrusted to me</i>

01:43.353 --> 01:46.731
by our people,
who are the sovereign power.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.566
<i>So this is the courthouse?</i>

01:49.484 --> 01:51.986
<i>There is no one here
to oppose your opinions.</i>

01:52.070 --> 01:55.740
Are you telling me to be Judas?

01:55.824 --> 01:57.075
<i>My fellow Koreans.</i>

01:58.576 --> 02:02.580
Your court is now in session.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.255
<i>I see a resemblance.</i>

02:12.549 --> 02:14.008
<i>More so than I'd expected.</i>

02:16.052 --> 02:17.679
I saw you fired without hesitation.

02:17.762 --> 02:19.430
<i>Were you going to kill the driver?</i>

02:19.514 --> 02:21.099
<i>If it was necessary, yes.</i>

02:21.182 --> 02:24.727
<i>Why is Judge Kang Yo-han
taking things this far?</i>

02:25.520 --> 02:28.731
<i>Do you think this is a trial
to shed light on his crimes,</i>

02:28.815 --> 02:30.233
<i>or the very opposite?</i>

02:30.316 --> 02:32.735
<i>I'll have to dig into it,
using whatever means.</i>

02:32.819 --> 02:36.906
I sentence you to 235 years in prison.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.741
<i>I thought this trial was all for show.</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:40.827
<i>I still don't get it.</i>

02:41.786 --> 02:44.539
<i>I found it very touching.
I even teared up a bit.</i>

02:45.290 --> 02:48.126
Maybe he hasn't been fully tamed.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.878
<i>Are you looking for this?</i>

03:08.396 --> 03:10.023
<i>Where am I?</i>

03:11.149 --> 03:13.484
<i>Stay put and don't wander around.</i>

03:14.319 --> 03:16.487
<i>Is there something I shouldn't see?</i>

03:16.571 --> 03:18.656
<i>Too much curiosity won't do you any good.</i>

03:20.450 --> 03:23.578
Who is this person? Who is he?

03:24.245 --> 03:25.705
Yo-han… Go.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.832
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

03:27.916 --> 03:30.960
The older brother of Master Yo-han,
Master Yi-sak.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.879
<i>I'm curious to know
how much you've discovered.</i>

03:32.962 --> 03:33.922
Stop bluffing.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.592
<i>You have no courage to accept your pain.</i>

03:39.844 --> 03:41.054
<i>That shook you up, did it?</i>

03:42.472 --> 03:45.058
<i>Do you know how they gained power?</i>

03:45.141 --> 03:46.851
<i>Turning crises into opportunities</i>

03:46.935 --> 03:49.312
is how those who move the world operate.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.563
Mr. President!

03:50.647 --> 03:53.066
<i>The Foundation aggressively expanded</i>

03:53.149 --> 03:55.360
the size of its charity projects
ever since the pandemic.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.403
<i>-What next?</i>
-Discord.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.240
<i>There's no way around it
if those who dominate the world</i>

04:00.323 --> 04:02.450
<i>have formed one team.
I need to shake them up first.</i>

04:02.533 --> 04:04.744
<i>What if I provided you with a bigger prey?</i>

04:04.827 --> 04:07.163
Like a conglomerate or even the president.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.707
<i>This is the Dream Base project by the SRF</i>

04:09.791 --> 04:11.751
for which a nation-wide donation effort
has been carried out.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.212
But we've received reports
that the project fund

04:14.295 --> 04:17.465
has been trickling
into some private pockets.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.551
<i>Now, to expose Kang Yo-han's
hand as a dud,</i>

04:20.635 --> 04:23.263
we need to show ours too.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.516
We have Chairman Seo, don't we?

04:27.475 --> 04:29.560
<i>You just waged war against the country.</i>

04:30.353 --> 04:31.688
Let's strike the body first.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.649
<i>I worked so hard to go back to it.</i>

04:35.316 --> 04:39.237
<i>The owner of the world
you kicked me out of.</i>

04:41.239 --> 04:43.283
<i>Looks like we'll need to meet, Judge Kang.</i>

04:44.284 --> 04:45.868
Don't tell me you are…

04:45.952 --> 04:48.663
<i>Hello, Young Master.</i>

04:49.247 --> 04:50.832
<i>Blackmailing me is useless.</i>

04:50.915 --> 04:52.542
Because I have

04:53.293 --> 04:54.335
nothing to protect.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.839
I'll also need to see
whether our Young Master

04:57.922 --> 04:59.882
<i>-Su-hyeon!
-has nothing to protect.</i>

04:59.966 --> 05:02.468
How dare you mess with Su-hyeon!

05:02.552 --> 05:05.555
I never laid a finger
on that childhood friend of yours.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.307
<i>Don't ever attack me again.</i>

05:07.974 --> 05:09.976
<i>-Ever.</i>
-How am I supposed to believe you?

05:10.059 --> 05:11.811
<i>There's something I'd like to show you.</i>

05:11.894 --> 05:15.106
Number 70618, Do Young-choon.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.817
<i>Never, not for one day,
have I forgotten his face.</i>

05:17.900 --> 05:19.235
This man isn't Do Young-choon.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.279
<i>This is called the system.</i>

05:21.362 --> 05:24.282
And the system is powerless
in front of authority.

05:24.365 --> 05:27.702
<i>It's the authority
that can wrap it around its finger.</i>

05:29.078 --> 05:30.621
<i>Why did you even go there?</i>

05:30.705 --> 05:33.166
To stir me up
because I always get in your way!

05:33.249 --> 05:34.375
I wanted you…

05:35.418 --> 05:37.336
<i>to be on my side.</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:41.257
So make your choice.
Will you stand in my way or stand with me?

05:41.340 --> 05:44.469
If there is no justice in this world
but only a game,

05:46.596 --> 05:47.805
<i>I'd now like to play
the winning game, myself.</i>

05:49.432 --> 05:51.267
<i>You asked me before</i>

05:51.350 --> 05:53.853
<i>about how to take on those
who control this world.</i>

05:53.936 --> 05:58.316
<i>It's to set it up so that there's no way
but to win even before the game begins.</i>

05:58.399 --> 05:59.650
Let me promise you one thing.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.194
<i>Your parents' enemy…</i>

06:01.277 --> 06:03.404
<i>They will pay</i>

06:03.488 --> 06:05.156
and very dearly too.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.033
<i>This isn't just for revenge.</i>

06:07.116 --> 06:10.578
I want to fight against
this distorted world.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.584
EPISODE 9

06:17.752 --> 06:18.836
So…

06:21.422 --> 06:23.007
you've made your choice, have you?

06:23.591 --> 06:26.803
It was you who forced me to make a choice.

06:28.262 --> 06:31.224
If there is no justice in this world
but only a game,

06:33.059 --> 06:36.145
I'd now like to play
the winning game, myself.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.317
Hey, so you worked so hard?

07:23.943 --> 07:25.319
"Pay us what we're owed?"

07:38.166 --> 07:39.208
Hands above your heads.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.377
Put your cameras down.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.467
Are you an officer?

07:48.593 --> 07:49.844
Do you want to shoot me?

07:51.762 --> 07:53.014
Go on.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.602
I know you can't.

07:57.685 --> 07:58.936
Put that down, now.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.314
Capture it on camera.

08:16.829 --> 08:17.955
Are you regretting it?

08:23.669 --> 08:25.338
Let me promise you one thing.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.216
Your parents' enemy,

08:29.425 --> 08:31.844
and those bastards who sneaked them out…

08:36.474 --> 08:38.017
They will pay

08:39.185 --> 08:40.478
and very dearly too.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.733
-This isn't just for revenge.
-Then what?

08:48.486 --> 08:49.695
I want to fight

08:50.446 --> 08:51.697
against this distorted world.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.545
Elijah?

09:08.673 --> 09:10.341
Yes, what is it?

09:10.424 --> 09:13.803
<i>Yo-han, please come here.
Things aren't looking so good here.</i>

09:13.886 --> 09:14.762
Where are you?

09:16.013 --> 09:17.348
Where are you exactly?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.768
Stay right there, all right?

09:22.103 --> 09:23.354
What's going on?

09:40.371 --> 09:41.998
Turn off the screen
but leave the microphone on.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.090
Are you all right?

09:51.632 --> 09:53.551
Mr. President, are you watching this?

09:55.052 --> 09:56.178
We, the patriot of this country,

09:57.054 --> 10:00.558
awoke to your summoning,

10:01.684 --> 10:04.937
but this cop here is
now trying to oppress us.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.902
Stand back.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.367
Shoot me.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.456
Hey what?

10:24.624 --> 10:27.209
Hey!

10:27.793 --> 10:29.003
Gosh…

10:29.545 --> 10:32.048
Hey! Who are you?

10:33.841 --> 10:34.842
Elijah…

10:36.802 --> 10:37.845
Elijah…

10:38.929 --> 10:40.139
Hey!

10:47.146 --> 10:48.147
Elijah!

10:48.230 --> 10:49.231
Su-hyeon!

10:50.650 --> 10:52.693
Go away! Don't touch me!

10:53.653 --> 10:54.737
Get out.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.702
Elijah, are you all right?
You're not hurt anywhere?

11:02.370 --> 11:03.621
It's Kang Yo-han!

11:04.538 --> 11:05.623
It's Kang Yo-han!

11:06.499 --> 11:09.001
Judge Kang, we respect you.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.504
Judge Kang, we're Jukchang TV.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.801
You remember me, don't you?

11:29.105 --> 11:30.398
Su-hyeon, are you all right?

11:30.481 --> 11:31.941
I'm fine. What about you?

11:32.024 --> 11:33.859
I'm fine. Are you hurt anywhere?

11:38.614 --> 11:40.616
You dare mess with my niece?

11:40.699 --> 11:44.787
I didn't know…

11:48.791 --> 11:51.085
That's enough! Are you going to kill him?

11:53.671 --> 11:54.922
Stop!

11:58.634 --> 11:59.802
Su-hyeon…

11:59.885 --> 12:01.262
I said stop.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.390
Put your gun down, Su-hyeon.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.728
You too, Judge Kang. Stop.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.302
Are you pointing your gun at me?

12:49.727 --> 12:51.896
They're under arrest for special violence.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.656
This is Yoon Su-hyeon. I need backup.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.379
Grab onto me.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.719
Say something, will you?

14:13.727 --> 14:16.522
Yoon Su-hyeon is a lunatic.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.192
-How dare she put you in danger?
-Su-hyeon's not at fault.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.235
"Su-hyeon?"

14:21.318 --> 14:24.446
I said I wanted <i>tteokbokki</i>
so she took me out.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.199
We bumped into them on our way back.
That's not her fault.

14:28.492 --> 14:32.705
I have no one to go have <i>tteokbokki</i> with,

14:33.622 --> 14:34.582
did you know?

15:12.536 --> 15:13.662
Judge Kang.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.210
I know what you're worried about,

15:20.878 --> 15:22.838
but Su-hyeon is a good person.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.256
I don't mean as an officer,

15:25.007 --> 15:27.885
but as a friend who cares about Elijah.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.263
Don't meddle with our affairs.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.516
How long do you think

15:34.600 --> 15:37.686
you can take care of a teenage girl
all by yourself?

15:38.604 --> 15:41.607
I understand your shock
from the cathedral fire,

15:41.690 --> 15:43.734
but Elijah is
not a six-year-old kid anymore.

15:43.817 --> 15:47.154
-You can't keep her locked up--
-She was kidnapped twice.

15:47.905 --> 15:48.822
What?

15:48.906 --> 15:51.742
There are many out there
who's after this family's wealth,

15:51.825 --> 15:54.328
and many who holds grudges too.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.539
And Elijah is quick to trust anyone
who's good to her.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.711
Because she's starved of affection.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.134
No matter how much you hate
this world and its people,

16:09.218 --> 16:10.636
you can't live alone.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.138
Everyone needs someone to rely on

16:14.223 --> 16:15.474
because we're human beings.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.189
I'll leave you to rest then.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.147
CHAIRWOMAN JUNG SEON-A

17:16.493 --> 17:18.370
It's my office at last.

17:21.623 --> 17:25.753
It was such a long journey,
coming all the way here.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.156
JAE-HEE

17:59.328 --> 18:00.454
<i>Hello, Seon-a.</i>

18:00.996 --> 18:02.039
What are you up to?

18:02.122 --> 18:03.332
What else?

18:03.415 --> 18:06.293
Enjoying my glamorous private life
after work.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.505
I see, so you're busy.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.923
<i>Is something up?</i>

18:11.006 --> 18:12.466
<i>If it's urgent, I'll come over.</i>

18:13.801 --> 18:14.968
Oh no.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.139
I thought maybe
we could have a glass of champagne.

18:20.307 --> 18:24.061
Seon-a, you're now
the mighty chairwoman of the SRF,

18:24.144 --> 18:26.188
<i>and you have no one to
enjoy champagne with?</i>

18:26.271 --> 18:28.232
<i>Never mind what others think.
Just have fun.</i>

18:28.315 --> 18:30.234
<i>So? Do you want me to
call you some models?</i>

18:31.276 --> 18:32.820
No, forget it.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.948
Have fun.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.548
Models?

18:54.883 --> 18:56.343
That should be fun.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.144
Judge Kang.

19:05.894 --> 19:06.895
Yes, what is it?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.981
I just received a call from Su-hyeon,

19:09.064 --> 19:11.024
and Jukchang TV crew
have all been released.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.568
All of them?

19:12.651 --> 19:14.862
It was the Police Commissioner's
director order.

19:14.945 --> 19:18.073
Why do you think the commissioner
took the matter into his own hands?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.367
So they're not just mere hooligans?

19:25.747 --> 19:26.874
Yes.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.793
Yes, all right.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.800
The Chief Justice wants to see us.
All three of us.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.093
What?

19:39.094 --> 19:40.596
This is very innovative.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.182
You're here.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.933
Have a seat.

19:57.029 --> 20:01.992
Our new chairwoman
of the support committee is very eager.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.411
She wants to start by
creating a PR video and poster

20:04.494 --> 20:08.957
for the <i>Live Court Show</i>
using you as the models.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.627
We need more media exposure

20:11.710 --> 20:13.670
so the public will rave more.

20:14.254 --> 20:17.174
So that they will admire Judge Kang,
love him,

20:17.257 --> 20:19.635
and go mad about wanting to
have him for themselves.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.762
At least I do.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.646
That was very funny, Chairwoman.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.731
But I wasn't joking.

20:33.607 --> 20:37.444
So you're telling us to be clowns
in front of the public, are you?

20:37.527 --> 20:41.114
Judge Kang, why are you being so cynical?

20:41.198 --> 20:44.409
The Foundation wants to
give our department a push.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.578
We should take this chance to
improve the court's standing.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.872
I won't hear anymore. Cooperate.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.375
As expected from the Chief Justice.
You sure know how to work.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.753
I'm sorry, but I don't think
that's our job as judges.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.547
I don't think it's a bad idea
to approach the public

20:57.631 --> 20:59.049
in a friendly manner.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.223
Is it really the <i>Live Court Show</i>
you want to promote?

21:06.306 --> 21:09.142
Of course. Why do you ask?

21:09.226 --> 21:11.895
Well, after the rather awkward events,

21:11.979 --> 21:14.773
the Foundation is still offering
to promote us

21:14.856 --> 21:16.900
and it's just unbelievingly thankful.

21:19.152 --> 21:23.282
Do you have a slogan in mind, perhaps?

21:25.617 --> 21:29.037
"Strong law and order, for a safe Korea.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.790
We, the Department
of the Live Court Show, stand with it!"

21:33.709 --> 21:36.586
It's the slogan we hear quite often
from the President these days.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.300
You're not too happy with it?

21:41.967 --> 21:45.053
You're not opposed to
government measures, are you?

21:46.221 --> 21:47.514
Sounds fun.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.934
Let's try it.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.145
Judge Kang.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.584
Gosh, Young Master! You're even
seeing me off today, are you?

22:19.963 --> 22:21.173
Was my warning not enough?

22:23.133 --> 22:25.886
I thought I told you
I don't have much patience.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.138
Oh, that?

22:28.221 --> 22:31.099
It's okay with me.
That didn't really scar.

22:32.225 --> 22:35.145
Stand in my way, and you'll pay the price.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.315
It looks like
you worked hard all this time.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.859
Would you be okay with that?

22:41.693 --> 22:42.903
Stand in your way?

22:43.612 --> 22:46.156
I'm only helping you out.

22:46.239 --> 22:48.408
The survivor of a tragic accident

22:48.492 --> 22:50.827
and the judge
who ruthlessly condemns evil.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.996
Yes, they're all very nice.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.582
Because that's the stuff
people rave about.

22:56.958 --> 23:00.003
But wouldn't it be more fun to
notch it up a level?

23:00.087 --> 23:02.756
There's just two years left
until the next presidential elections.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.550
Instead of those folks like
Heo Joong-se and Cha Gyeong-hui,

23:09.429 --> 23:11.723
you should be in charge of this country.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.600
It suits you, you know.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.978
Shining brightly from the very top.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.063
And?

23:18.897 --> 23:20.065
Use me.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.566
Use the Foundation.

23:22.818 --> 23:23.819
Interesting.

23:25.195 --> 23:28.657
So you're telling me to be a sheepdog
rather than a wolf.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.785
Like you.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.039
There is much material
that the public will rave about.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.583
Child abuse, rapists, gangs…

23:39.376 --> 23:41.545
While you make a big show of
cleaning up those jerks,

23:41.628 --> 23:44.005
I'll make you an even greater hero.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.258
The Foundation can put anyone at the top.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.677
We even managed it with that trash,
Heo Joong-se.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.268
So just two more years, and with me…

23:56.351 --> 23:58.145
I like everything except for that part.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.856
"With you."

24:01.731 --> 24:03.567
Have some respect for my taste.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.409
Young Master.

24:16.913 --> 24:20.959
Can't you be a little nicer to me?

24:29.551 --> 24:30.719
See you!

24:46.776 --> 24:49.446
-I thought you might care for a drink.
-Thank you.

24:51.364 --> 24:53.742
They were quite the occupying forces

24:54.993 --> 24:57.913
and they're using us
as an excuse for what they're doing.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.166
It's not a bad tactic to play along.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.376
We can always look for gaps while at it.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.419
That's true, but…

25:05.253 --> 25:07.547
Promotion? This isn't child's play.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.132
Oh, but it is.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.510
That's the woman she is.

25:15.931 --> 25:16.848
What is it?

25:19.392 --> 25:22.103
Do you know about Chairwoman Jung Seon-a?

25:23.021 --> 25:25.774
Were you two acquainted
in the past or something?

25:26.441 --> 25:27.567
Yes.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.361
And in this very house too.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.695
Here?

25:31.279 --> 25:32.739
Didn't the nanny tell you?

25:33.406 --> 25:35.242
About the maid who jumped.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.161
Then was that a true story?

25:38.245 --> 25:40.497
About how you played
with someone's feelings?

25:40.580 --> 25:42.499
You are like him.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.584
What do you mean this time?

25:46.044 --> 25:48.046
Judging a book by its cover.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.631
<i>Why did you do such a thing?</i>

25:50.382 --> 25:53.051
That girl could have died.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.053
She may even never walk again.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.435
Yo-han, I'm worried about you.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.146
There was that incident at school too.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.357
Who knows
what you will get yourself into next?

26:09.776 --> 26:12.821
I'm worried what Father will do with you
if something like this keeps happening.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.658
Yo-han, promise me one thing.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.620
That you won't harm the innocent.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.084
Well?

26:43.852 --> 26:44.894
Here.

26:47.063 --> 26:50.150
Every time you look at it,
remember our promise.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.029
All right?

27:23.933 --> 27:27.354
That's the man my brother was.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.856
He failed to understand
even until his final moments.

27:33.651 --> 27:37.614
That there's no such thing
as the innocent.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.879
THE BLUE HOUSE

27:52.962 --> 27:55.840
-Mr. President?
-Yes.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.926
The investigation
on the extremist organization

27:58.009 --> 28:00.220
who embezzled the donations
show no progress.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.596
Oh, I know you.

28:01.679 --> 28:04.557
Mr. Park, why are you in such a rush?

28:04.641 --> 28:07.519
An organization is
an organization for a reason.

28:07.602 --> 28:10.563
They hide in an organized way.
That's why they're an organization.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.774
Please give us some time.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.568
Our investigative
authorities are competent.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.946
-Yes.
-Recently, an influencer, Jukchang TV,

28:18.029 --> 28:22.492
and its growing number of followers
have been inflicting mob violence

28:22.575 --> 28:24.411
in the name of "civil vigilance."

28:24.494 --> 28:28.164
Also, there have been reports that
the police is turning a blind eye to them.

28:28.248 --> 28:32.043
That's fake news! Can't you tell?

28:32.127 --> 28:34.754
Who says that?
By the way, who are you affiliated with?

28:34.838 --> 28:36.589
Are you really a journalist?

28:36.673 --> 28:39.801
Secretary Choi, what are you doing?
You can't just let anyone come in.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.637
What the hell do you think you're doing?

28:42.721 --> 28:44.139
Get it right!

28:44.222 --> 28:46.641
Otherwise you are all fired!

28:46.725 --> 28:48.435
You, over there. The female reporter.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.853
Is that a smirk I see?

28:51.271 --> 28:53.148
Hey, you think you're so smart, do you?

28:55.567 --> 28:58.945
MOB VIOLENCE BY ONLINE INFLUENCERS
PRESIDENT HEO DENIES NEGLIGENCE

29:04.325 --> 29:07.495
That trash is our president?

29:07.579 --> 29:09.164
I don't believe this!

29:10.749 --> 29:12.333
The Blue House is getting anxious.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.753
Of course. They overreached themselves.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.964
It was a mistake
to put him there in the first place.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.717
This is all because of
that old geezer, Seo Jeong-hak!

29:21.676 --> 29:24.179
My fellow Koreans!

29:24.262 --> 29:26.514
How is this a normally functioning nation?

29:26.598 --> 29:30.393
We're continuing to lose
more precious lives to the pandemic.

29:30.477 --> 29:35.148
Those elites and the privileged
who were born into wealthy families!

29:35.231 --> 29:40.737
They don't care one bit about us,
ordinary working-class.

29:40.820 --> 29:43.364
But I was born
from a working-class like you,

29:43.448 --> 29:46.993
and still untainted
by the filthy political arena.

29:47.076 --> 29:51.039
I, Heo Joong-se,
your celebrity and your man of choice,

29:51.122 --> 29:54.250
will resurrect our country
once and for all!

29:54.334 --> 29:56.085
I swear by my life

29:56.169 --> 29:59.714
that I will change Korea, totally!

30:04.052 --> 30:05.136
Well done.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.805
Heo Joong-se,
representing the ordinary people.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.807
Very ordinary, indeed.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.646
Chairman Seo, well…

30:16.022 --> 30:17.482
As you said,

30:17.565 --> 30:20.777
do you think
I'll survive in that political jungle?

30:20.860 --> 30:24.823
Well, I say we won't have to worry
about losing face during the race.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.910
I'm quite good with live shows.

30:28.993 --> 30:31.371
-So please believe in me.
-Yes, good work.

30:31.454 --> 30:32.664
Thank you.

30:32.747 --> 30:37.627
Salute. Salute to you all!

30:45.385 --> 30:48.054
Are you sure about going with him?

30:48.137 --> 30:52.100
My sentiments exactly. He's a mere clown,
hosting the Foundation's events at most.

30:52.183 --> 30:56.145
-Now, a presidential candidate?
-But he used to be a well-known actor.

30:56.229 --> 31:00.066
And his YouTube channel is
super hot with over six million views.

31:00.817 --> 31:04.070
What we need
in times of crises like this is a clown.

31:05.488 --> 31:08.700
Besides, even if you were
to become the president now,

31:08.783 --> 31:12.370
you'll be hounded throughout your term
if you can't cub the pandemic.

31:12.453 --> 31:15.623
So why volunteer to be the cannon fodder

31:15.707 --> 31:18.877
when you could just sit back
and control everything.

31:19.752 --> 31:21.963
Don't you agree, Congresswoman Cha?

31:23.214 --> 31:25.383
<i>They just didn't want
a president who was in control.</i>

31:25.466 --> 31:27.719
Plus, it turned out that
it wasn't his wish

31:32.015 --> 31:34.642
<i>but that mere secretary's
who had been standing behind him.</i>

31:38.688 --> 31:41.733
STRONG LAW AND ORDER, SAFE KOREA

31:58.499 --> 31:59.959
I'm so sorry!

32:00.043 --> 32:01.461
I'm a little late.

32:01.544 --> 32:04.672
Oh no, we're still getting ready,
Chairwoman.

32:04.756 --> 32:09.636
So are these two lights all you have?
Don't you think the lighting's too weak?

32:13.181 --> 32:16.726
Still, our judges are glowing.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.784
Just perfect.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.099
Happy?

32:56.891 --> 32:58.059
Yes.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.478
Know your limits.

33:00.561 --> 33:01.980
Okay.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.483
All good. Let's get started.

33:07.443 --> 33:09.320
Judges, in your positions, please.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.907
The staff members are to step back!

33:14.033 --> 33:16.202
Make sure to do a good job
with the lighting.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.954
Yes, sir.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.414
We want it to look natural.

33:23.960 --> 33:27.171
Great. Now face the camera.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.757
That's great. Judge Kim, give me a smile.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.467
Cross your arms, at least.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.177
-Cross our arms?
-Yes.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.432
Judge Kim, your face is too tense.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.643
Make use of that charming face, will you?

33:42.437 --> 33:44.564
Naturally, now.

33:44.647 --> 33:45.565
Smile!

33:46.607 --> 33:47.900
That's our diva!

33:51.446 --> 33:54.365
May I stand in the middle this time?

33:55.283 --> 33:57.785
-Sure, go ahead.
-Thank you!

33:57.869 --> 34:00.329
Judge Oh, you know
how to get a great shot.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.247
You're the best!

34:10.048 --> 34:11.549
I'm sorry. Let me take this call.

34:14.677 --> 34:15.845
Yes.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.890
Did you get what I asked you?

34:18.973 --> 34:22.935
Yes, we have all the materials
on Jung Seon-a's past.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.647
<i>Should I leak it to Cha Gyeong-hui
as you said last time?</i>

34:27.648 --> 34:30.485
Yes, but hide the sources.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.945
Oh, and make sure to include this too.

34:34.072 --> 34:37.116
That she was a former maid for our family.

34:39.494 --> 34:43.331
Minister Cha. We have info
on Jung Seon-a from our intelligence.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.677
Wow, what an interesting woman.

35:10.858 --> 35:11.943
Ma'am.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.362
Hello, Master Ga-on.

35:15.863 --> 35:16.948
The coffee was…

35:17.031 --> 35:18.866
Let me get it for you.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.618
What beans would you like?

35:20.701 --> 35:23.538
It's okay.
You don't have to treat me like a guest.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.498
All right, then.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.167
<i>Spycam criminals, pickpockets, hooligans…</i>

36:09.250 --> 36:11.711
<i>Let's clean up the evil</i>

36:11.794 --> 36:14.589
<i>that corrodes our country!</i>

36:14.672 --> 36:18.593
-We are…
-The power!

36:18.676 --> 36:21.596
-Flog him!
-Flog him!

36:34.025 --> 36:35.484
What is that?

36:35.568 --> 36:37.653
Aren't they the crazy bastards
from before?

36:37.737 --> 36:38.738
Elijah.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.908
Why are you watching their videos?

36:42.950 --> 36:45.286
They're clearly losers.
What do they mean they're the power?

36:46.913 --> 36:49.415
There were seven cases of assault
just yesterday alone

36:49.498 --> 36:51.292
that copied these so-called losers.

36:51.375 --> 36:52.376
And…

36:55.421 --> 36:57.298
They uploaded this video today.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.928
<i>If you're going to shoot, shoot!</i>

37:02.011 --> 37:07.266
<i>How could an officer point her gun
at an innocent citizen, who's unarmed?</i>

37:07.350 --> 37:08.935
<i>Aren't you ashamed of yourself?</i>

37:09.018 --> 37:09.936
Oh wow.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.271
So they're pretending
to be the victims, are they?

37:12.355 --> 37:13.731
This is unbelievable.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.400
Let's put them away in prison.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.652
Do you want my help?

37:18.236 --> 37:21.280
It's okay.
I'll try sorting it out for now.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.698
All right.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.952
But if it gets too tough,
make sure to tell me.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.665
All right?

37:32.041 --> 37:34.126
All right. Thanks.

37:45.846 --> 37:48.474
Don't tell me
you're going to cook, are you?

37:48.557 --> 37:51.102
But Yo-han told you not to.

37:51.185 --> 37:52.979
This is for Master Ga-on.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.898
He never told me not to cook.

37:55.982 --> 37:58.818
Well, I'd appreciate it
if you would for me.

37:58.901 --> 38:03.239
-Elijah, why don't we eat together?
-Oh no, I'm fine. I'm really fine.

38:03.322 --> 38:07.118
-Still, she's taking her time to--
-I said I don't like Korean food!

38:07.201 --> 38:09.996
Are you a goldfish?
You can't remember a thing I say, can you?

38:15.835 --> 38:18.337
I'm sorry.
Perhaps I shouldn't have said that.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.842
It's all right, I'm used to it.

38:24.677 --> 38:28.848
And to tell you the truth,
Ms. Elijah has brightened up a lot.

38:30.599 --> 38:32.018
Has she?

38:32.685 --> 38:37.732
She's never been the first to
make the initiative,

38:37.815 --> 38:39.692
or to talk to anyone.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.279
Not since that incident.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.830
It's all thanks to you, Master Ga-on.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.541
I know I'm a little abrupt with people,

38:55.624 --> 38:58.502
so this is my way of
expressing my gratitude.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.191
Will he be okay?

39:21.192 --> 39:22.693
Gosh, I don't care.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.200
Wow, this is amazing.

39:29.283 --> 39:32.912
Well, this is nothing.

39:32.995 --> 39:34.080
Please enjoy.

39:34.747 --> 39:36.040
Thank you for the food.

39:48.594 --> 39:51.722
I hope it suits your palate.

39:54.350 --> 39:55.935
Well…

39:57.061 --> 39:59.772
It's very new.

40:02.066 --> 40:05.778
That's because I added wild honey,

40:05.861 --> 40:09.031
which is a rare delicacy
you may not be used to.

40:10.783 --> 40:14.286
So you added wild honey
to bean paste stew…

40:14.370 --> 40:16.705
That's amazing.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.088
This is ginseng kimchi.

40:26.549 --> 40:30.594
You'll find it exquisite
because I added plenty of truffle oil.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.055
-Truffle oil…
-Delicious, isn't it?

40:37.393 --> 40:38.686
So…

40:39.937 --> 40:40.896
Ma'am.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.857
Yes, please go on.

40:42.940 --> 40:46.318
When did you say Judge Kang
stopped you from preparing meals?

40:47.736 --> 40:50.072
He'd eat less and less.
And one day, he had me stop

40:50.156 --> 40:52.158
preparing meals altogether.

40:52.241 --> 40:55.828
He'd finish everything without
a complaint in the past,

40:57.037 --> 40:58.914
but I guess he's now started to doubt me.

41:00.082 --> 41:01.876
Without a complaint?

41:08.424 --> 41:09.550
Go on.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.970
Oh, it's a little too hot.

41:13.053 --> 41:16.182
Here, have some more ginseng kimchi.

41:24.523 --> 41:26.192
So you hate Korean food, do you?

41:27.109 --> 41:29.820
I guess you finished everything.
Your face is pale.

41:32.364 --> 41:33.616
Why didn't you stop her?

41:33.699 --> 41:37.411
How can I when she's putting
all the effort into cooking?

41:39.079 --> 41:42.124
She'd go scouring for
whatever's good for health.

41:42.208 --> 41:43.792
What a foolish woman.

41:49.381 --> 41:51.634
So that's why
you'd all finished everything

41:52.343 --> 41:53.344
without a complaint.

42:00.434 --> 42:03.020
Did you leak info on Jung Seon-a
to Cha Gyeong-hui?

42:03.103 --> 42:04.980
Yes, as instructed.

42:07.274 --> 42:10.528
She's probably collecting whatever
info she can get on the Foundation.

42:10.611 --> 42:12.863
I need to sneak that out somehow.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.746
Elijah, what is it?

42:20.829 --> 42:22.331
<i>-When are you coming?</i>
-What?

42:22.414 --> 42:25.292
When are you coming home? I'm hungry.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.127
<i>What are you…</i>

42:27.211 --> 42:29.088
Ga-on made dinner for us.

42:29.922 --> 42:32.341
But he won't serve it
until everyone's here.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.218
<i>So hurry up, all right?</i>

42:45.396 --> 42:47.481
-Let's go home.
-Pardon?

42:47.565 --> 42:50.776
-What about tonight's appointment?
-We can always delay it for one day.

42:50.859 --> 42:51.902
Yes, Judge Kang.

44:22.993 --> 44:24.411
Did you call for me, sir?

44:27.331 --> 44:28.624
It's time to get them.

44:29.458 --> 44:30.668
Who are you talking about?

44:30.751 --> 44:34.880
Your enemy,
and those that sneaked him out.

44:43.597 --> 44:45.265
Did you find that bastard?

44:45.349 --> 44:47.768
And the evidence that Cha Gyeong-hui
sneaked him out?

44:48.435 --> 44:51.855
Not yet.
However, I did find out who to ask.

44:52.773 --> 44:53.649
This is Mr. Go.

44:55.943 --> 44:56.902
Mr. Go?

44:57.486 --> 44:59.363
He's been doing a lot for us

44:59.446 --> 45:02.574
in both collecting info
and leaking it to the prosecution.

45:03.909 --> 45:07.287
Many prosecutors wish to
join our law firm.

45:08.497 --> 45:12.209
There is only her personal assistant
whom Cha Gyeong-hui will trust

45:13.627 --> 45:14.920
if not anyone else.

45:15.504 --> 45:19.133
And he'd been making monthly trips
out of Seoul using her official vehicle.

45:19.216 --> 45:20.384
I see.

45:21.009 --> 45:23.470
And is this secretary very loyal?

45:24.346 --> 45:26.932
<i>He's her closest ally.
He served her for over ten years</i>

45:27.015 --> 45:28.934
<i>since her days as a congresswoman.</i>

45:29.017 --> 45:30.936
<i>It won't be easy getting him to talk then.</i>

45:32.312 --> 45:33.814
Still, we'll have to try it.

45:33.897 --> 45:38.318
-Let's first get in touch with him, and--
-That's my job and I'm already on it.

45:47.077 --> 45:48.036
<i>Then…</i>

45:49.705 --> 45:52.708
-I'll try getting him to talk.
-What's your plan?

45:53.292 --> 45:55.878
-You have enough money to spare, right?
-What?

45:56.545 --> 46:00.299
You say money can be a powerful motive.

46:27.743 --> 46:28.994
Are you awake now?

46:30.621 --> 46:32.289
Judge Kim Ga-on?

46:32.372 --> 46:34.249
What the hell are you doing?

46:46.803 --> 46:48.138
I'd like to have a little chat with you.

46:49.264 --> 46:53.227
I'm curious about the man in his 50s
whom you're regularly checking on

46:54.019 --> 46:55.521
to report to Minister Cha.

46:55.604 --> 46:57.481
What are you talking about?

46:57.564 --> 47:00.150
-I know nothing.
-Oh, but I'm sure you do.

47:01.109 --> 47:05.072
His name is Do Young-choon
and he's a franchise fraudster.

47:05.155 --> 47:07.533
My late parents were his victims too.

47:08.033 --> 47:10.661
What has that got to do with me?

47:12.621 --> 47:15.249
Of course I don't expect you
to have a conscience.

47:25.384 --> 47:28.762
These are gold bars from Switzerland,
500 million won for each.

47:30.055 --> 47:32.849
One billion, and 1.5 billion.

47:33.934 --> 47:34.977
Total 1.5 billion.

47:35.811 --> 47:40.232
Would this be enough to buy
your loyalty for Cha Gyeong-hui?

47:44.444 --> 47:45.779
Oh, it's not enough, is it?

47:54.663 --> 47:55.581
Two billion.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.458
Your tricks won't work with me.

47:58.542 --> 48:00.502
You think I'll betray Minister Cha?

48:00.586 --> 48:01.503
Then 2.5 billion.

48:03.171 --> 48:05.591
You think I'm serving her for money?

48:05.674 --> 48:07.801
She'll lead our country one day.

48:11.388 --> 48:12.472
You'll regret it.

48:12.556 --> 48:15.851
I don't care what you do
because my principles won't change.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.153
You're still at it?

48:29.323 --> 48:30.616
Judge Kang Yo-han?

48:34.369 --> 48:36.163
I gave you the tool,
but you don't know how to use it.

48:41.835 --> 48:43.128
All right.

48:43.211 --> 48:45.631
Here's 2.5 billion. Will you talk?

48:46.506 --> 48:48.342
-What do you take me for?
-Fine.

48:49.009 --> 48:51.386
Two billion. Now will you talk?

49:00.520 --> 49:03.065
All right. 1.5 billion. I'm a busy man.

49:04.316 --> 49:05.359
Wait.

49:06.860 --> 49:09.029
-Let me think--
-One billion.

49:17.037 --> 49:18.622
I'll tell you.

49:19.247 --> 49:20.749
I'll tell you everything!

49:52.239 --> 49:53.865
I didn't think it'd be this simple.

49:54.574 --> 49:58.078
Humans feel greater suffering
when they're robbed of what they had.

50:25.397 --> 50:28.316
Who knew Do Young-choon would be
hiding out at a place like this?

50:29.359 --> 50:30.902
Don't get your hopes up

50:30.986 --> 50:33.280
because we're only here today
to take a look.

50:33.363 --> 50:36.450
We'll come back again
after we come up with a plan

50:36.533 --> 50:38.160
about what to do with him.

51:55.904 --> 51:57.155
Yes, over there.

51:59.908 --> 52:01.034
Honey!

52:01.117 --> 52:03.203
Goodness.

52:03.286 --> 52:05.664
-It's braised spicy chicken today.
-Looks delicious!

52:05.747 --> 52:08.500
Make sure to eat up today.

52:08.583 --> 52:10.836
You need more protein the older you get.

52:10.919 --> 52:15.006
I can take care of myself,
so you eat a lot.

52:15.090 --> 52:16.842
I know farming's hard work.

52:16.925 --> 52:19.928
Are you two newlyweds?
You're making me cringe.

52:20.011 --> 52:23.265
As you know, I've done many
awful things to your mother.

52:23.348 --> 52:26.226
-What about me?
-Of course to you too.

52:26.309 --> 52:29.896
-Here, eat up.
-Goodness, you…

52:29.980 --> 52:31.398
-This is all for you.
-Sure.

52:32.399 --> 52:34.484
It turned out great today.

52:34.568 --> 52:36.695
It's delicious.
Hey, there's a bug in here.

52:36.778 --> 52:38.572
Honestly, you!

52:40.699 --> 52:41.950
Shocked, are you?

52:42.033 --> 52:44.327
Honestly, the things your father says…

53:32.709 --> 53:33.919
Kim Ga-on.

53:34.669 --> 53:36.087
Keep your head cool.

53:38.089 --> 53:40.800
He's our best bait
to catch Cha Gyeong-hui.

53:41.718 --> 53:45.513
So it's not your business, is it?
You only care about your plan.

53:45.597 --> 53:47.390
Do you know how I feel right now?

53:48.850 --> 53:50.644
This isn't your revenge alone.

53:52.020 --> 53:53.813
To get to where she is today,

53:53.897 --> 53:57.233
Cha Gyeong-hui sacrificed many
who were innocent.

53:58.818 --> 54:00.487
The father of my friend from earlier

54:00.570 --> 54:03.031
was wrongly accused of
being a sex offender by Cha Gyeong-hui

54:03.114 --> 54:04.491
after she was bribed.

54:04.574 --> 54:06.576
He ended up taking his own life.

54:06.660 --> 54:09.120
Besides, how will you face
your childhood friend

54:09.871 --> 54:12.082
after smearing blood on your hands?

54:26.221 --> 54:28.139
Death to Do Young-choon!

54:28.223 --> 54:29.641
Execute him!

54:37.983 --> 54:40.694
I've done many awful things
to your mother.

54:40.777 --> 54:41.778
<i>Don't.</i>

54:42.445 --> 54:45.031
<i>Don't ruin your life
because of someone like him.</i>

54:45.115 --> 54:47.075
<i>It's not worth it, Ga-on.</i>

55:18.523 --> 55:19.733
Ga-on!

55:20.734 --> 55:21.860
Su-hyeon.

55:24.070 --> 55:25.947
What are you doing here on a weekday?

55:26.031 --> 55:28.783
-And why are you dressed like this?
-I took a day off today.

55:28.867 --> 55:29.826
Why?

55:31.369 --> 55:32.746
Because I wanted to see you.

55:34.122 --> 55:35.707
Are you in your right mind?

55:36.499 --> 55:39.878
That's very commendable of you!

55:45.675 --> 55:47.093
-Delicious.
-It's good.

55:48.428 --> 55:49.971
-What's yours?
-Banana.

56:02.567 --> 56:04.569
This is nice.

56:04.652 --> 56:06.696
I wish every day were like today.

56:08.948 --> 56:11.242
-Su-hyeon.
-Yes?

56:11.326 --> 56:14.996
I'm just asking this, but…

56:15.914 --> 56:17.624
What if I were to do something bad?

56:20.001 --> 56:21.211
Something bad?

56:23.588 --> 56:25.256
What? Here? All of a sudden?

56:26.925 --> 56:28.343
No, not something like that.

56:29.511 --> 56:31.763
I mean something real bad.
Like commit a crime.

56:33.640 --> 56:34.849
What?

56:35.391 --> 56:38.394
Do you even need to ask?
I'd cuff you right away with my own hands.

56:38.478 --> 56:40.188
How dare a judge break the law.

56:40.271 --> 56:41.815
You think I'll just overlook it?

56:42.690 --> 56:43.817
Right?

56:45.276 --> 56:47.695
Of course you should
since that's who you are.

56:50.657 --> 56:52.492
What's this about anyway?

56:52.575 --> 56:54.119
Something's happened, right?

56:55.453 --> 56:59.415
No, I just wanted to say nonsense
after seeing you.

57:06.631 --> 57:09.050
Have you been riding your bike drunk?

57:09.884 --> 57:11.261
What's with you this time?

57:57.265 --> 57:58.266
Who are you?

58:00.268 --> 58:01.895
Repenting for your sin, are you?

58:07.734 --> 58:10.653
Who are you?

58:11.613 --> 58:14.282
Who gave you the right to fake atonement?

58:15.492 --> 58:17.785
Do you know how many died because of you?

58:20.997 --> 58:24.417
Are you one of the victims?

58:31.549 --> 58:33.384
I know what I did was unforgivable.

58:35.595 --> 58:36.930
I'm sorry.

58:37.722 --> 58:40.475
Don't make me laugh.
Do you think I'll fall for it?

58:40.558 --> 58:42.352
I know what kind of a man you are.

58:43.228 --> 58:46.481
Where did you stash all that money anyway?

58:47.232 --> 58:48.608
No…

58:49.359 --> 58:50.902
No.

58:50.985 --> 58:54.489
Most were seized and what was left were…

58:55.615 --> 58:58.076
all taken by Minister Cha.

58:59.744 --> 59:02.956
I have nothing now.

59:04.415 --> 59:06.167
I wanted to expiate my wrong,

59:06.251 --> 59:08.253
but there was no way to.

59:10.004 --> 59:13.132
So I've been waiting quietly
for the day I go to hell.

59:16.803 --> 59:18.513
Thank you for coming.

59:18.596 --> 59:19.847
Please…

59:20.890 --> 59:23.017
kill me.

59:32.485 --> 59:35.613
Yes. You should go to hell.

59:36.614 --> 59:37.991
I'll do as you wish then.

59:50.712 --> 59:51.963
Die.

59:54.591 --> 59:56.050
Die!

59:57.885 --> 1:00:01.389
Honey! Who are you?
Why are you doing this?

1:00:01.472 --> 1:00:04.183
Honey! Please, Honey!

1:00:04.267 --> 1:00:05.393
Die!

1:00:05.476 --> 1:00:08.605
Let him go, please!

1:00:08.688 --> 1:00:09.731
Dad!

1:00:13.484 --> 1:00:15.653
Spare him!

1:00:15.737 --> 1:00:18.615
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

1:00:18.698 --> 1:00:20.325
Kill me instead!

1:00:20.408 --> 1:00:22.785
-Please let him go.
-Please… Why are you doing this?

1:00:22.869 --> 1:00:24.078
Honey…

1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:35.298
Please…

1:00:35.381 --> 1:00:38.343
Please let him go.

1:00:38.426 --> 1:00:40.303
Please…

1:00:46.225 --> 1:00:48.561
Who are you to even
try to repent for your sin?

1:00:51.230 --> 1:00:53.524
Why can't you even let me get my revenge?

1:00:54.233 --> 1:00:55.943
I'm sorry.

1:00:58.529 --> 1:01:00.490
You have no right to be a human.

1:01:03.910 --> 1:01:05.411
You should have been a devil.

1:01:07.830 --> 1:01:10.333
You should have remained a devil
all this time!

1:01:10.917 --> 1:01:13.086
I'm sorry.

1:01:22.011 --> 1:01:23.554
I really am sorry…

1:01:27.266 --> 1:01:30.311
Let go of me. I said let me go! Let go!

1:01:36.234 --> 1:01:37.610
Why are you doing this?

1:01:37.694 --> 1:01:39.779
-Come here.
-Honey!

1:01:45.368 --> 1:01:46.744
Honey!

1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:49.956
Honey!

1:01:54.502 --> 1:01:56.129
Enough of your pretense.

1:01:56.754 --> 1:02:00.758
My money. My money… my money!

1:02:00.842 --> 1:02:07.348
My money! My money…

1:02:07.432 --> 1:02:10.852
My money…

1:02:14.522 --> 1:02:15.732
Looking for this, are you?

1:02:19.694 --> 1:02:21.863
My money! My money…

1:02:27.118 --> 1:02:28.494
Hold onto him.

1:02:29.162 --> 1:02:33.416
My money…

1:02:34.208 --> 1:02:35.293
My money…

1:02:40.506 --> 1:02:42.383
Don't!

1:02:44.135 --> 1:02:46.471
Don't! It's my money!

1:02:46.554 --> 1:02:47.430
My money…

1:02:47.513 --> 1:02:48.681
Don't!

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:51.434
Hey, you bastard!

1:02:51.517 --> 1:02:54.937
-Judge Kang.
-My family's in there.

1:02:55.938 --> 1:02:58.024
-There's someone in there!
-Don't!

1:02:59.442 --> 1:03:01.152
-Judge Kang.
-Someone's still in there.

1:03:01.235 --> 1:03:03.112
Help us!

1:03:03.196 --> 1:03:05.364
There are people in there…

1:03:07.992 --> 1:03:09.076
-Kang Yo-han!
-Don't!

1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:10.787
Help us!

1:03:12.246 --> 1:03:14.791
Don't! Please stop!

1:03:14.874 --> 1:03:17.001
I'm only trying to give him a chance.

1:03:20.296 --> 1:03:21.214
-Don't…
-Please…

1:03:21.297 --> 1:03:22.924
-Don't!
-There are people in there.

1:03:23.007 --> 1:03:23.966
No!

1:03:31.557 --> 1:03:32.725
Help us!

1:03:32.809 --> 1:03:37.063
No! Please stop. No…

1:03:38.147 --> 1:03:41.359
Not my money…

1:03:50.535 --> 1:03:53.037
Honey! Help!

1:03:55.081 --> 1:03:56.833
Don't…

1:03:59.836 --> 1:04:01.546
Let go. Let go of me!

1:04:01.629 --> 1:04:03.548
Just calm down
and take a good look at him.

1:04:06.801 --> 1:04:08.553
My money…

1:04:10.096 --> 1:04:11.681
My money!

1:04:15.309 --> 1:04:17.395
My money!

1:04:23.609 --> 1:04:24.986
My money!

1:04:25.778 --> 1:04:30.366
My money!

1:04:41.002 --> 1:04:43.504
What is it? This is fake money!

1:04:54.348 --> 1:04:58.311
This isn't my money…

1:05:03.190 --> 1:05:05.234
-I need to save them!
-Calm down.

1:05:05.985 --> 1:05:07.486
Look at his bare face.

1:05:23.669 --> 1:05:24.795
Honey…

1:05:25.421 --> 1:05:27.423
Help us!

1:05:27.506 --> 1:05:29.258
This way.

1:05:30.593 --> 1:05:33.930
This is…

1:05:34.013 --> 1:05:38.851
Honey, this is…

1:05:39.602 --> 1:05:42.897
He'd even deceived his family
telling them he had nothing left.

1:05:44.523 --> 1:05:47.026
Seo-jin…

1:05:47.109 --> 1:05:50.529
I really had no choice…

1:05:50.613 --> 1:05:53.991
I'm not lying. Seo-jin…

1:05:54.075 --> 1:05:57.286
Honey, let me explain.

1:05:59.830 --> 1:06:00.998
Hey!

1:06:05.670 --> 1:06:07.505
Don't go!

1:06:09.006 --> 1:06:11.926
Don't leave me! Don't go…

1:06:12.009 --> 1:06:13.386
Honey…

1:06:15.846 --> 1:06:16.847
Honey…

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:21.018
Here. If you want your revenge, go ahead.

1:06:21.102 --> 1:06:22.603
Don't hesitate.

1:06:29.276 --> 1:06:30.403
Please…

1:06:32.029 --> 1:06:35.741
I'm sorry. Please save my life…

1:06:35.825 --> 1:06:39.453
I didn't do this…

1:06:40.788 --> 1:06:42.331
Please let me go.

1:06:43.249 --> 1:06:44.709
I'm sorry.

1:06:45.292 --> 1:06:46.752
I'm sorry.

1:06:46.836 --> 1:06:49.547
I'm really sorry.

1:07:07.982 --> 1:07:10.776
I'm sorry…
I deserve to die for what I did.

1:07:22.413 --> 1:07:23.956
My money… My money!

1:07:41.348 --> 1:07:43.392
He's our only bait
to catch Cha Gyeong-hui.

1:07:45.019 --> 1:07:46.479
Let's not make him go to waste.

1:08:10.836 --> 1:08:12.963
Let go, damn it! Let go of me!

1:08:18.385 --> 1:08:20.805
So where is the real money, anyway?

1:08:21.847 --> 1:08:24.600
Over there, where he buried it.

1:08:26.519 --> 1:08:28.104
So it was just trickery?

1:08:29.522 --> 1:08:30.898
I told you.

1:08:30.981 --> 1:08:35.569
Humans goes crazy when they think
they've lost what they had.

1:09:20.447 --> 1:09:22.199
Come on, just one spoonful.

1:09:22.283 --> 1:09:24.451
Just one spoonful, all right?

1:09:42.011 --> 1:09:45.639
TO THE VICTIMS OF THE FRAUD
BY DO YOUNG-CHOON

1:10:30.643 --> 1:10:32.728
THANK YOU TO JUNG EUN-PYO
AND PARK HYOUNG-SOO

1:10:32.811 --> 1:10:34.521
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:11:02.299 --> 1:11:06.011
<i>I'm the type who enjoys
toppling it all at once like this.</i>

1:11:06.095 --> 1:11:09.723
How could they put
a patriotic youth to trial?

1:11:09.807 --> 1:11:11.767
Why did you pick such a scandalous case?

1:11:11.850 --> 1:11:14.895
-Cooperate.
-Why should I mind it?

1:11:14.979 --> 1:11:18.983
<i>If he still doesn't get our warning,
we'll have to get rid of him.</i>

1:11:19.066 --> 1:11:20.693
Monsters aren't created.

1:11:20.776 --> 1:11:24.363
They were always there, lying dormant.

1:11:24.446 --> 1:11:26.532
What is this "revolution fund"
in the first place?

1:11:28.826 --> 1:11:30.869
You should've been nicer…

1:11:32.121 --> 1:11:33.622
We have failed this time.

1:11:35.416 --> 1:11:39.712
