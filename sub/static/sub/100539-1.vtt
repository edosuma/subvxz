WEBVTT

00:56.857 --> 00:59.625
- The final container is here?

00:59.627 --> 01:00.492
- Yes sir.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.796
I examined the contents myself.

01:03.798 --> 01:05.597
They're all glocks.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.666
- All 45's and nine's?

01:07.668 --> 01:08.934
- Yeah.

01:08.936 --> 01:09.902
Top quality.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.438
(man chuckles)

01:12.440 --> 01:13.906
That new guy, he heard
about what you did

01:13.908 --> 01:16.175
to that chump that
tried to cheat you.

01:16.177 --> 01:19.878
Let's just say he's
very accommodating.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.115
Even the slightest request.

01:31.992 --> 01:35.060
(upbeat rock music)

01:59.587 --> 02:03.122
¶ When push comes to shove ¶

02:03.124 --> 02:07.192
¶ And you're lying
in the floor ¶

02:10.264 --> 02:11.163
Permission?

02:15.402 --> 02:16.635
- Who the hell was that?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.138
- He's a driver for
my stepdad's friends.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.073
- Well he almost ran
us off the damn road.

02:21.075 --> 02:22.107
- That might be better
than what happens

02:22.109 --> 02:23.342
if he tells my stepdad.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.310
- Is he really that bad?

02:25.312 --> 02:26.778
- My dad wasn't the greatest,

02:26.780 --> 02:29.815
but it's times like these that
make me miss him the most.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.416
- Wait, I thought you didn't
have to answer to anybody.

02:31.418 --> 02:32.584
- I didn't.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.119
My dad gave me
access to my trust,

02:34.121 --> 02:36.355
but my new legal guardian
wants to control my life.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.625
(man sighs)

02:39.627 --> 02:42.694
(upbeat rock music)

02:49.904 --> 02:50.936
- Like clockwork.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.740
- You think Mikhailov
is really involved

02:54.742 --> 02:58.844
in criminal activity or
just an ambitious Russian

02:58.846 --> 02:59.811
building an empire?

03:01.015 --> 03:01.880
- Or both.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.217
- Did you read the
Interpol report?

03:06.587 --> 03:09.755
Sure sounds like this is the
same man, don't you think?

03:09.757 --> 03:13.258
I mean, I've read
a lot of reports.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.965
(upbeat rock music)

03:28.275 --> 03:29.274
- Good morning sir.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.782
- The doctor, he
has been here, da?

03:36.784 --> 03:37.716
- Yes sir.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.284
He's upstairs waiting for you.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.353
I was just about to take
up her morning snack.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.721
Would you like to take it?

03:44.225 --> 03:46.725
- My sister, she has called?

03:46.727 --> 03:47.626
- No sir.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.028
- Contact me when she does.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.233
- Good morning Mr. Mikhailov.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.868
- Tell me anything, doctor.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.205
Doesn't seem to be change.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.075
- The good news is there's
nothing seriously wrong.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.944
Her wheezing is just
some slight congestion.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.080
Repositioning her
and adding another

04:08.082 --> 04:09.514
pillow will help with that.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.619
- And her weight?

04:13.620 --> 04:14.920
- That's something that
we need to monitor.

04:14.922 --> 04:19.191
Unfortunately, brain injury
recovery has no rules.

04:20.928 --> 04:24.096
- When I play music
for her, her eyes move.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.265
- Yes.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.199
Marie mentioned that.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.269
- That's a good sign, no?

04:31.872 --> 04:33.705
- Could be recovery, yes,

04:33.707 --> 04:37.542
but more than likely is reactors
firing off in her brain.

04:37.544 --> 04:40.178
Tatiana could stay like this,

04:40.180 --> 04:42.881
or she could fall
back into a coma.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.951
There's a chance she
could even recover,

04:45.953 --> 04:48.520
but with damage like this,

04:48.522 --> 04:50.856
it's impossible to
predict right now.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.661
- Spaceibo doctor.

04:57.298 --> 05:00.966
I appreciate your
honesty and privacy.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.238
If you should need
favor, you come see me.

05:07.574 --> 05:12.077
- I appreciate that Mr.
Mikhailov, but unnecessary.

05:12.946 --> 05:13.912
Just glad to help.

05:18.585 --> 05:22.621
- So, I'm having lunch with
Olga and Katarina today.

05:24.058 --> 05:28.794
Katarina's considering
university, politics
of all things.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.266
Tatiana, please, eat more.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.111
Tatiana.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.981
(man speaking in
foreign language)

05:49.983 --> 05:50.916
Come back to me.

05:54.822 --> 05:55.787
- There you go.

05:55.789 --> 05:56.621
Here's your water.

05:56.623 --> 05:57.456
- Thanks man.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.290
Good workout.

05:58.292 --> 05:59.124
- You did great.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.258
- Thanks.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.293
Missed you Jason.

06:01.295 --> 06:02.894
Where have you been hiding?

06:02.896 --> 06:04.329
- You know me.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.365
I was looking for the
next big adventure.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.234
- Well, when you're looking
for something new to explore,

06:09.236 --> 06:10.569
you should call me.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.440
- You here to hit the
weights or on clients?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.012
- Showing off again.

06:21.014 --> 06:21.847
- Does it work?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.081
- On your audience?

06:24.284 --> 06:25.951
Yes.

06:25.953 --> 06:26.852
- Are you?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.622
- I am not in your
audience demographic.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.624
- What's my demographic?

06:33.961 --> 06:36.595
- Apparently, easily impressed.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.532
- You know Liz, you
can't resist me forever.

06:44.838 --> 06:48.306
- You need to add a few
extra reps to the left.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.179
- No one will hire
this guy, Liz.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.447
He's a real scumbag.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.450
- That's why I'm
friends with you.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.620
- Well, if Jason is against you,

07:01.622 --> 07:04.890
then that's all the more reason
that I'd love to hire you.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.625
Let's go talk.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.261
(man chuckles)

07:10.898 --> 07:14.166
(upbeat electronic music)

07:14.168 --> 07:15.300
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.768
Can I get you
gentlemen anything?

07:16.770 --> 07:20.205
- Why don't you come a little
closer to let me see you.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.039
Come on.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.141
- I'm not on the menu.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.544
There's some pretty
good prime rib tonight.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.645
Does that sound good?

07:27.448 --> 07:29.514
- I don't like prime rib.

07:29.516 --> 07:32.083
- Hey, big boy, you
don't wanna get in me

07:32.085 --> 07:33.985
trouble with my boss now.

07:33.987 --> 07:34.886
- Gentlemen!

07:37.257 --> 07:38.857
Can I help you?

07:40.594 --> 07:42.294
- No buddy, we're fine.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.495
Me and the little lady are just

07:43.497 --> 07:45.197
sitting here and getting
to know each other.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.767
- Can I get you
gentlemen any coffee

07:48.769 --> 07:50.302
before you hit the road?

07:51.538 --> 07:55.240
- Yes ma'am, that would
be very kind of you.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.741
I'm sorry about the
misunderstanding.

07:56.743 --> 07:59.511
Me and my buddy here were just
trying to have a little fun.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.380
- Looks like your pal just
stuck you with the check.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.417
- Sorry for the
misunderstanding.

08:06.386 --> 08:09.454
(upbeat rock music)

08:13.160 --> 08:14.726
- [Man] Andrei, do
you have a moment?

08:17.231 --> 08:18.697
- You have something to say?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.466
- Yes sir.

08:21.468 --> 08:22.868
I came to apologize.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.369
I meant no harm.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.872
I was showing off my friend
around the curb too fast.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.176
- And this friend, he
encourage you to do this?

08:32.379 --> 08:33.478
- No.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.846
I was trying to scare him.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.086
- Perhaps you should choose
your friends more careful

08:41.088 --> 08:43.822
if they encourage you
to be thoughtless.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.291
Do not associate with
strays outside of Opulent.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.396
- We need to make some changes.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.365
Apparently, you have too
much free time on your hands

08:53.367 --> 08:54.933
and you're getting in trouble.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.936
You stop embarrassing
this family.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.039
I think it's time you got a job.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.007
- I don't need a job.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.909
I have a trust fund.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.977
- You don't start showing
some responsibility

09:05.979 --> 09:08.480
and respect to this family,

09:08.482 --> 09:10.115
you won't have a
job and you won't

09:10.117 --> 09:12.617
have a trust fund, or a car.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.591
- Hey, bourbon on the
rocks for my friend here.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.327
- Can things get any worse?

09:23.430 --> 09:24.262
- What?

09:24.264 --> 09:25.096
What happened?

09:25.098 --> 09:26.097
He didn't look upset.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.299
- That's Rami.

09:27.301 --> 09:29.534
He's always playing the part.

09:29.536 --> 09:30.869
He wants me to get
a job right away

09:30.871 --> 09:33.438
or he's gonna take my
car and cut me off!

09:34.241 --> 09:35.941
- So get a job.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.475
- I have a huge trust fund.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.611
I don't need a job.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.813
- I know, but your
dad controls it.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.915
- Don't call him my dad!

09:43.917 --> 09:45.717
- Don't you wanna
be your own man?

09:45.719 --> 09:49.688
- There is nothing more manly
than having power and money.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.022
I already have both.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.997
- So how'd it go?

09:58.999 --> 09:59.898
- Very well.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.702
(man speaking in
foreign language)

10:03.704 --> 10:05.570
- You still interested
for moving up?

10:05.572 --> 10:06.471
- Yes sir.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.076
- That man with Jason, I'd
like you to keep an eye on him.

10:11.078 --> 10:11.977
- Yes sir.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.478
- I don't trust him.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.646
He is not our kind.

10:18.385 --> 10:21.586
- Why is there an
extra place set?

10:21.588 --> 10:24.422
- Your uncle is joining us.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.858
- I thought you hated him.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.794
- Katarina, we
don't hate family.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.564
It's complicated, love.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.433
(doorbell rings)

10:35.435 --> 10:37.135
- Shall I get that?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.503
- Well yes, Khouri.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.405
That would be helpful.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.573
- Sorry ma'am.

10:45.712 --> 10:46.544
Right ma'am.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.579
Sorry ma'am.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.316
- It's probably already cold.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.754
- You made it.

10:55.756 --> 10:59.257
- She is certainly not
the fastest servant.

11:00.594 --> 11:02.827
- Any news from Tatiana?

11:05.065 --> 11:06.965
- She's having a marvelous time.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.366
Sends her best to you both.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.368
Why do you ask?

11:11.772 --> 11:14.472
- Can't even check in with
one of my closest friends?

11:15.842 --> 11:19.944
I find it a bit odd that she
hasn't returned my calls.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.148
I hope I have not offended her.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.950
- She'll be returning soon.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.720
I'm sure she can't wait
to tell you all about it.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.356
- Katarina, why don't you
take your breakfast upstairs?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.472
You're acting a bit
odd this morning.

11:48.875 --> 11:52.410
- You are refreshingly
accommodating this morning.

11:53.447 --> 11:54.546
I don't trust this.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.548
What are you hiding?

11:58.351 --> 12:00.151
- I'm not like you (woman
speaking in foreign language).

12:01.555 --> 12:04.355
I have no need for secrets.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.857
- We all have secrets.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.360
- [Olga] And what
secrets are you hiding?

12:10.397 --> 12:11.963
- My secrets?

12:11.965 --> 12:14.966
Pay for you to live like this.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.704
- I am very grateful, Andrei.

12:21.108 --> 12:26.111
Your secrets are your own
and my secrets are my own.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.279
(man chuckles)

12:28.281 --> 12:30.148
- Same blood runs
in both our veins.

12:31.284 --> 12:31.916
- That it does.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.455
- Khouri, coffee please!

12:46.633 --> 12:50.268
(suspenseful violin music)

12:53.240 --> 12:55.440
Is the next step in place?

12:58.044 --> 13:00.645
I will call you when I
have the time and the date.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.083
I will be in the room myself.

13:05.085 --> 13:08.186
I want to see his
face when it happens.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.655
- When what happens?

13:10.657 --> 13:12.423
- Nothing darling.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.360
Why don't you go
clean your room?

13:15.362 --> 13:16.561
- We have a maid!

13:16.563 --> 13:18.296
- [Olga] Now!

13:18.298 --> 13:20.865
(girl growls)

13:22.335 --> 13:23.935
- I'm surprised the
bureau partnered

13:23.937 --> 13:25.770
you up with me for
this assignment.

13:25.772 --> 13:26.838
Your first time out.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.342
- Seems pretty routine with me.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.012
Surveillance only, no
contact with the perp.

13:35.749 --> 13:38.516
- You're the play by the
book type of agent I take it.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.086
- He's coming through now.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.024
Like clockwork.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.760
Home at three, back to
the restaurant at six.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.564
That's suspicious.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.167
- Did you see the occupants?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.838
- Damn, I missed the car.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.375
- It's probably just
coincidence that

14:04.377 --> 14:06.244
that car pulled
out after Andrei.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.512
- Coincidence?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.514
Nothing's a coincidence.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.382
I know that you're
a rookie at this,

14:11.384 --> 14:13.384
but I need a partner I count on.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.486
Both of our careers
are on the line here.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.423
- What's that supposed to mean?

14:18.425 --> 14:22.126
- Nothing personal, but I'm
gonna ask for a new partner.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.862
We'll get you reassigned to...

14:24.664 --> 14:25.496
- What?

14:25.498 --> 14:26.731
- Nothing personal.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.399
I just can't risk you outing me.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.303
(upbeat electronic music)

14:32.305 --> 14:33.638
- I'm a happy man.

14:34.608 --> 14:35.440
- Your shipment has arrived?

14:35.442 --> 14:36.774
- Yes.

14:36.776 --> 14:40.845
And compared to my
previous supplier,

14:40.847 --> 14:45.183
when I thought you said you
were gonna sell me cheap guns,

14:45.185 --> 14:46.651
I thought you meant cheap.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.654
- How happy do you wish to be?

14:50.590 --> 14:51.589
- What do you mean?

14:53.326 --> 14:56.427
- I suppose you
noticed my new friends.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.631
- The two guys in the suits?

14:59.633 --> 15:02.100
They stick out like sore thumbs.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.569
- I need a new place
to conduct business,

15:04.571 --> 15:06.838
a new distribution
solution for my supplier.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.377
- Drugs and guns,
it's a felony offense.

15:13.546 --> 15:14.545
- Don't get caught.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.715
- Well I wouldn't
be a businessman

15:17.717 --> 15:20.818
if I didn't say I was
the least bit intrigued.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.253
What'd you have in mind,

15:22.255 --> 15:24.856
two of the most lucrative
products out on my storefronts?

15:26.192 --> 15:30.395
- You can offer a buy
back, get gun for special.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.166
- Let's work out the details.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.534
This calls for a drink.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.871
- Get Rami his usual.

15:39.873 --> 15:43.441
(upbeat electronic music)

15:56.690 --> 15:58.423
- What's up with that guy?

15:58.425 --> 16:00.391
Why does he keep staring at us?

16:00.393 --> 16:01.960
- He's always been odd.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.161
I've noticed since
his wife mysteriously

16:03.163 --> 16:05.029
left town a few weeks
back, it's worse.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.498
Rumor has it, she's sick.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.068
- Well if she's sick,

16:10.070 --> 16:12.236
why does he keep saying
that she left town?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.305
- Katarina says it has something

16:14.307 --> 16:15.540
to do with being foreigners.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.808
They don't like
to show weakness.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.745
- I don't know.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.881
There's more than just
mistrust in that stare.

16:23.883 --> 16:24.749
Shoot.

16:27.954 --> 16:28.853
Jeez.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.522
I gotta get going.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.025
You mind giving me
a ride to my car?

16:34.027 --> 16:36.461
I gotta be up early in
the morning for the gym.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.063
I got a new client.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.699
(man clicks his tongue)

16:41.701 --> 16:42.600
Thanks buddy.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.074
- A shot of bourbon.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.245
- I assume our little
problem has resolved itself?

16:54.247 --> 16:57.749
- What problem?

16:57.751 --> 16:59.283
- Put his drinks on my tab.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.318
- You got it, boss.

17:01.654 --> 17:02.553
- And the van?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.156
- On the competition's turf.

17:05.959 --> 17:08.459
Got a message and a solution.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.795
- [Man] Excuse me boss.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.565
- Why the fuck everybody
interrupt my conversations?

17:14.567 --> 17:15.700
- I need your input.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.573
It's not good.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.476
- You bring me this
problem because?

17:26.913 --> 17:29.047
Look, that's why I hired you.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.349
Now taker Coyote with
you and do your damn job!

17:32.585 --> 17:37.655
- Come on, come on.

17:42.695 --> 17:43.761
- Stop.
- No!

17:51.337 --> 17:54.972
- Clean up this mess and
re-enforce with all the others

17:54.974 --> 17:59.110
that no one off the list
will no longer be tolerated.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.352
(footsteps)

18:11.257 --> 18:13.458
- Good morning Mr.
and Mrs. Amari.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.659
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.260
- Shall I set a plate
for Master Jason?

18:16.262 --> 18:18.563
- Yes, set it right over there.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.068
- He'll be down shortly, Rami.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.903
He promised me last
night he'll be up

18:25.905 --> 18:27.872
early for job hunting today.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.808
- You're expecting those
promises to not be broken?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.110
- He wasn't even up
when I came down.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.344
- Nelly.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.579
- You need to stop
badgering Jason.

18:34.581 --> 18:37.014
It doesn't inspire
him to listen.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.783
- I don't feed
Master Jason with the

18:38.785 --> 18:41.085
same silver spoon
you do, Sandra.

18:41.087 --> 18:45.490
He has no ambition, no
thoughts of the future.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.092
If he doesn't get a job
by the end of the week,

18:48.094 --> 18:49.494
I'm cutting him off.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.864
- You own dozens
of corporations.

18:52.866 --> 18:56.667
I don't understand why you
don't just give him a job.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.504
It makes no sense
for him to job hunt.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.439
- We're not doing
this right now.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.876
- Dad, can I get
my allowance early

19:04.878 --> 19:06.577
since I finished all my chores?

19:06.579 --> 19:07.945
- Sure sweetie.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.413
Here you go.

19:09.415 --> 19:12.250
(phone vibrates)

19:13.319 --> 19:14.652
- Oh my God!

19:16.055 --> 19:17.722
- What is it, stocks down?

19:17.724 --> 19:18.956
- No.

19:18.958 --> 19:23.494
A body found here in
Opulent shot in a van.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.428
- In Opulent?

19:25.398 --> 19:26.631
A body?

19:26.633 --> 19:27.899
Who?

19:29.836 --> 19:30.885
Where?

19:30.886 --> 19:31.935
- Nelly, you shouldn't
be hearing this.

19:31.938 --> 19:32.937
- Yes mom.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.572
I'm gonna go see
Katarina anyway.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.307
- Okay honey.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.749
Be careful.

19:44.750 --> 19:45.749
- Nelly will probably
graduate college

19:45.752 --> 19:48.019
and get a job and have a family

19:48.021 --> 19:50.988
long before Jason
gets employment.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.990
(phone rings)

19:52.992 --> 19:54.225
Hello?

19:54.227 --> 19:55.126
I gotta go.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.864
(woman sighs)

20:03.937 --> 20:09.006
- This is certainly turning
into an uneventful assignment.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.145
- You call two missing agents
and their vehicle uneventful?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.981
- No bodies, no vehicle.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.616
They probably got
paid off and they're

20:18.618 --> 20:21.085
on some tropical
island somewhere.

20:21.087 --> 20:24.121
- Normally, I'd laugh at
that, but not these guys.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.457
They were quality agents.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.492
Something bad happened here.

20:28.494 --> 20:29.594
I'm gonna find out.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.897
- At least we got
eyes watching us.

20:35.301 --> 20:38.069
- Oh yeah 'cause
that's gonna save us.

20:40.974 --> 20:43.207
- The meeting is set.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.843
Make sure every house
is in attendance.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.013
Every boss needs to be there.

20:51.484 --> 20:55.386
We have no choice but
to eliminate them.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.358
We can't flourish shadowed
in fear of retaliation.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.431
- Is there a reason
we're walking around

21:07.433 --> 21:09.267
in the indigenous slums?

21:10.937 --> 21:11.769
(man yells)

21:11.771 --> 21:12.603
(girls yell)

21:12.605 --> 21:13.771
(man giggles)

21:13.773 --> 21:14.739
- Oh my gosh,
Nelly, are you okay?

21:14.741 --> 21:15.940
- No she's not okay!

21:15.942 --> 21:17.975
She thought you were
gonna murder us!

21:17.977 --> 21:21.245
Can we go somewhere
less tetanusy please?

21:21.247 --> 21:22.713
- Yes princess Katarina.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.016
We'll go somewhere more
suitable to your delicacies.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.857
- What was that
with you and Tom?

21:33.660 --> 21:34.992
- What do you mean?

21:34.994 --> 21:36.761
- Do you like him?

21:36.763 --> 21:37.662
- No.

21:38.665 --> 21:39.930
I mean, maybe.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.567
(girls yell)

21:43.569 --> 21:44.435
- Hey!

21:59.252 --> 22:00.117
- Yeah.

22:10.797 --> 22:11.696
- Good job, kid.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.400
- It's gonna be all right.

22:16.402 --> 22:17.435
I'll take care of
everything, okay?

22:20.106 --> 22:21.005
- No problem.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.577
- Give me a scotch.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.314
Save the rocks for Ricky's face.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.552
Remi's boy told me
about your heroics.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.921
- I don't know if I'd
call them heroics.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.222
- Andrei thought it was.

22:38.224 --> 22:40.624
That's why he offered you a gig.

22:40.626 --> 22:43.227
- I got a good job at the gym.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.696
I plan on working up
to weekend manager.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.732
After that, who knows.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.900
- And that's your goal?

22:51.604 --> 22:54.271
- My grandpa was a
cop, a great one.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.842
- That's the reason
you're turning this down?

22:57.844 --> 23:00.778
It's a legit gig if
it makes a difference.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.014
- I'll give it some thought.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.018
The job at the gym is part-time.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.756
I could use the extra
income for the house.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.024
- The house?

23:15.128 --> 23:17.628
- It was paid for
a long time ago.

23:17.630 --> 23:21.465
My grandpa took out a mortgage
after my grandma got sick

23:21.467 --> 23:23.434
and he died a few
weeks after she did.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.337
- What about mom and dad?

23:28.307 --> 23:30.741
- My mom passed away
when I was a kid,

23:30.743 --> 23:32.810
dad took off to the war.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.546
He never wrote, never
tried to contact her.

23:36.849 --> 23:41.218
She used to tell me he
didn't even know I existed.

23:42.722 --> 23:43.988
That's that.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.358
- A lot of us came
back from that war,

23:48.461 --> 23:50.861
couldn't go back
to our old lives.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.266
- We have new employee?

23:56.702 --> 23:57.568
- Yes sir.

23:58.404 --> 23:59.236
Thank you.

24:00.339 --> 24:03.240
- Believe me, you
will earn every penny.

24:05.711 --> 24:07.711
- We have a problem.

24:07.713 --> 24:10.314
- This is no way to start
a conversation with me.

24:10.316 --> 24:14.385
- Andrei, if I could handle
this myself, I would do it.

24:14.387 --> 24:16.454
- Must I handle everything?

24:16.456 --> 24:17.655
What is it?

24:17.657 --> 24:19.390
- One of our girls
is partially missing.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.525
- Partially?

24:21.527 --> 24:22.993
What's this mean, partially?

24:24.664 --> 24:26.163
- The rest of her is missing.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.467
- Get Coyote on
this and clean up.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.601
Find the rest of her.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.072
Who booked this client?

24:35.074 --> 24:37.808
- No one was on the books
and no one saw him come in.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.976
- Is there video?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.277
- Coyote is on that now.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.579
First thing he asked for.

24:42.415 --> 24:43.914
- Close down brothel for tonight

24:43.916 --> 24:46.717
and give the girls an extra
bonus for the money they lose.

24:47.453 --> 24:48.919
Lock the back door,

24:48.921 --> 24:50.221
nobody going in and out except
for the front restaurant.

24:50.223 --> 24:51.121
- Even the girls?

24:52.091 --> 24:53.657
- The girls stay put.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.592
Have kitchen bring them meals.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.560
Tell Angelo he's in charge.

24:56.562 --> 24:57.461
- Will do.

25:06.839 --> 25:07.972
- Jesus.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.242
- I take it you know
what this means.

25:11.244 --> 25:13.978
- What is it with
Russians and body parts?

25:16.582 --> 25:18.782
- It's better than the
heads Americans send.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.652
- Any idea who this may be?

25:23.356 --> 25:25.823
- The new one, Gina.

25:27.260 --> 25:30.728
- Maybe it was personal,
something before she came here.

25:30.730 --> 25:31.662
- Does it matter?

25:32.865 --> 25:34.565
- No, I guess not.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.835
- I want you to
find who did this.

25:39.272 --> 25:41.906
Then find the rest of
her, preferably alive.

25:45.478 --> 25:46.944
- Is this something special?

25:48.681 --> 25:50.447
- She was my property.

25:50.449 --> 25:51.348
I want it back.

25:59.625 --> 26:03.193
(upbeat electronic music)

26:21.113 --> 26:22.046
- [Jason] I'm out
front and my car's

26:22.048 --> 26:23.414
getting lots of attention.

26:28.588 --> 26:29.753
- You all right?

26:29.755 --> 26:30.588
- Thanks man.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.156
I owe you one.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.024
- Make it a six
pack, we're even.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.365
(man laughs)
- This guy.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.405
Meet Donnie.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.611
- I finally get to meet
Rick's newest project.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.313
- He's my friend.

26:57.249 --> 26:57.948
- It's like a project, man.

27:01.721 --> 27:04.221
Friend Jason, very
nice to meet you.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.723
I wouldn't be driving
a car like that

27:05.725 --> 27:10.060
around here if you
want no trouble, right?

27:10.062 --> 27:10.894
You guys good?

27:10.896 --> 27:12.062
- Yeah.

27:12.064 --> 27:12.730
- Thanks man.
- I'll see you guys.

27:12.732 --> 27:13.964
- Bye.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.132
Should've asked you
to drive that old

27:15.134 --> 27:16.433
station wagon in
your gardener's, man.

27:16.435 --> 27:17.935
- No worries dude, it's cool.

27:18.938 --> 27:19.870
- I changed my mind.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.171
- About?

27:21.173 --> 27:22.973
- About the extra
income car connection.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.141
- What's going on?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.210
- Dude, the bank's
foreclosing on my place.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.212
I don't know what the
heck I'm gonna do.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.414
I just got another
job offer by Andrei.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.050
Between that and the gym,

27:33.052 --> 27:35.619
I don't think I'm gonna have
enough to cover it in time.

27:35.621 --> 27:36.587
- What about a loan?

27:36.589 --> 27:37.521
(man laughs)

27:37.523 --> 27:38.722
- A loan, really?

27:38.724 --> 27:39.823
Nobody's gonna give
me a loan, man.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.058
- I will.

27:41.060 --> 27:41.992
- I'm not gonna ask
you to do that for me.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.260
- You're family.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.696
Besides, I know a way we
can make that money back

27:45.698 --> 27:48.432
a hell of a lot quicker than
a couple part-time jobs.

27:49.235 --> 27:50.134
- Really?

27:53.773 --> 27:54.672
I'm listening.

28:08.454 --> 28:11.422
- Maria, you did
right to alert me.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.390
Anything seem suspicious?

28:13.392 --> 28:14.825
- No sir, just odd.

28:15.895 --> 28:19.196
They wanted to wait
here to speak with you.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.597
- And Tatiana?

28:20.599 --> 28:25.669
- Sambor is with her.

28:26.672 --> 28:27.337
(man speaking in
foreign language)

28:27.339 --> 28:28.238
- Uncle.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.407
- So nice to see you.

28:38.050 --> 28:38.916
Are you okay?

28:41.754 --> 28:42.686
- I'm fine.

28:42.688 --> 28:43.821
I'm just a little shaken up.

28:45.691 --> 28:47.191
- Then I suspect
there is some reason,

28:47.193 --> 28:50.861
some valid reason for you
to be in my home, uninvited?

28:52.131 --> 28:54.064
- Our piano was out of tune.

28:55.201 --> 28:58.102
- Uncle, don't be
upset with mother.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.237
She's just here for
me and what happened.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.874
- I am having this
thoroughly investigated

29:03.876 --> 29:06.844
and I promise I will
find out why and who.

29:09.515 --> 29:12.316
- The who, I'm not sure of.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.785
The why, it's a takeover plot.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.255
- And this is the
first you tell me?

29:19.558 --> 29:21.225
- I just heard about it.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.628
- Hear, what this
mean hear, from who?

29:26.732 --> 29:31.802
- Andrei, you made a lot of
enemies before we left Russia.

29:33.806 --> 29:38.642
Our identities are not
fool-proof, ours or yours.

29:39.612 --> 29:40.878
- Get to the point.

29:42.181 --> 29:45.516
- You are delving deeply
into international endeavors.

29:46.786 --> 29:49.853
Is it possible that you've
gotten onto the Yakuza's radar?

29:49.855 --> 29:51.622
- Tell me what you
think you know.

29:52.691 --> 29:54.391
- You've been sloppy
with your work,

29:54.393 --> 29:57.194
you've been sloppy
with your identity,

29:57.196 --> 29:59.363
what kind of man in
hiding gets his name

29:59.365 --> 30:01.899
plastered on every
business in town,

30:03.102 --> 30:06.703
what kind of criminal
runs for a town mayor?

30:06.705 --> 30:10.140
- Sloppy, this is not
sloppy, this is smart.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.409
What criminal in hiding
would run for mayor?

30:14.180 --> 30:15.479
Besides, I am not criminal,

30:15.481 --> 30:18.382
I am businessman like
any American businessman

30:18.384 --> 30:22.986
who hides his accomplishments
behind contracts and lawyers.

30:22.988 --> 30:28.058
- When it all comes crashing
down, remember, I warned you.

30:33.766 --> 30:35.465
- Good afternoon, Jason.

30:35.467 --> 30:38.135
Andrei and your dad both told
me you might be coming in.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.305
- They did?

30:41.307 --> 30:42.639
- Yes.

30:42.641 --> 30:45.509
Said that you were
investigating a few job options

30:45.511 --> 30:47.945
and that our bank
might be one of them.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.281
- Actually, we're here
regarding an investment

30:51.283 --> 30:52.549
I'm about to enter into.

30:54.019 --> 30:57.721
I think real estate is a
viable commodity at this point,

30:57.723 --> 30:59.423
nothing speculative of course.

31:00.726 --> 31:03.060
- Do you have a
property in mind?

31:03.062 --> 31:05.095
- Yes, as a matter
of fact, I do.

31:06.398 --> 31:09.900
- Wait here a moment and
I'll grab the branch manager.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.004
- Really?

31:14.006 --> 31:16.139
- How are you gonna get
this house from Rami?

31:16.141 --> 31:17.074
- I'm not.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.308
I'm gonna use my slush fund.

31:20.079 --> 31:20.978
- Slush fund?

31:21.947 --> 31:23.714
- My personal savings fund,

31:23.716 --> 31:24.948
backup money I
save for every time

31:24.950 --> 31:27.084
my dad put a freeze
on my other accounts.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.189
- Look, thanks.

31:32.191 --> 31:33.423
This means a lot to me.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.826
- No problem.

31:35.828 --> 31:38.061
It's only $10,000, didn't
even put a dent in my balance.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.664
Besides, our new business
venture will surely

31:40.666 --> 31:43.300
give you the cash you
need to pay me back.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.702
- Wait, wait, what venture?

31:47.873 --> 31:50.040
- How are you at
distribution and sales?

31:54.113 --> 31:56.713
(upbeat music)

32:14.033 --> 32:14.865
Hey man.

32:14.867 --> 32:16.566
- What took you so long?

32:16.568 --> 32:17.868
I was starting to get worried.

32:17.870 --> 32:19.403
- I've got you all set up.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.104
You're gonna be
making so much money.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.507
- I kept thinking that
everyone knew why I was here.

32:23.509 --> 32:24.741
- I know the feeling.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.009
- You both will be
thanking me when

32:26.011 --> 32:28.845
your pockets are stuffed
with money, easy money.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.950
Remember, just the
pharmaceuticals
to high schoolers

32:32.952 --> 32:34.918
you don't know and
save the coke for the

32:34.920 --> 32:37.054
rich kids you know and we trust.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.388
Any questions?

32:38.390 --> 32:39.423
- No man, I'm good.

32:41.794 --> 32:42.993
- Get out of here.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.194
The supplier knows
you're coming.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.102
- He's just a kid.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.670
- A soon to be rich and
popular kid thanks to us.

32:53.672 --> 32:54.738
- It's not helping.

32:55.607 --> 32:56.573
- It was his choice.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.108
He does the pickup and sales.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.476
No drugs pass through our hands.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.911
Everybody wins.

33:03.682 --> 33:06.550
You're the one with the
sentimental family home to lose.

33:07.953 --> 33:11.021
(upbeat drum music)

33:39.885 --> 33:41.418
- Move the placard
closer to the building.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.286
I don't want anybody
tripping on it.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.591
- Here's the food you
requested, Mr. Mikhailov.

33:47.593 --> 33:51.061
- Take it over to the men in
the van, with my compliments.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.209
(knocking)

34:06.211 --> 34:07.377
- No thank you, ma'am!

34:07.379 --> 34:08.311
We're fine!

34:08.313 --> 34:09.980
- Compliments of Mr. Andrei!

34:12.484 --> 34:13.383
(knocking)

34:13.385 --> 34:14.317
- What?

34:14.319 --> 34:16.186
- With Mr. Andrei's compliments.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.388
- No, no, no thank you.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.590
- I can't leave
until you take this,

34:20.592 --> 34:23.093
so perhaps you just take it
so I can get back to work.

34:23.095 --> 34:23.994
- Seriously?

34:28.834 --> 34:30.567
(man yells)

34:30.569 --> 34:31.668
Can we arrest her?

34:33.405 --> 34:34.905
- Mr. Mikhailov, if you would,

34:34.907 --> 34:37.207
just take a quick walk
through with Maya,

34:37.209 --> 34:39.643
make sure that everything's
up to your expectations

34:39.645 --> 34:40.844
for this evening.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.279
- Good.

34:42.281 --> 34:43.480
I wanna make sure the
entertainment's loud enough

34:43.482 --> 34:44.414
so none of the
conversations from

34:44.416 --> 34:45.749
the meeting can be overheard.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.250
- And all security will
be dressed as staff

34:47.252 --> 34:49.019
to ensure no one gets too close.

34:49.888 --> 34:50.720
- Good.

34:50.722 --> 34:51.922
You tell the escort,

34:51.924 --> 34:53.590
tell him this is chair
filler duty only.

34:53.592 --> 34:54.858
I don't want any
physical connection

34:54.860 --> 34:57.360
to personal proposition
to be made of any kind.

34:57.362 --> 34:58.462
- Understood.

34:58.464 --> 34:59.362
Jing!

35:02.234 --> 35:04.968
I've alerted all staff
to be here at 5PM

35:04.970 --> 35:08.171
and guests should arrive at 6PM.

35:08.173 --> 35:10.874
- All members have been
informed Miss Maya.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.109
- Great.

35:12.111 --> 35:14.244
Go keep an extra eye on
the girls tonight, okay?

35:14.246 --> 35:15.645
- Yes Miss Maya.

35:20.219 --> 35:23.220
- They're not moving as
fast as they used to.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.222
I cannot keep
purchasing merchandise

35:25.224 --> 35:26.656
that doesn't turn quickly.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.494
- Guns are one of the
fastest selling commodities.

35:30.496 --> 35:31.428
What are you doing wrong?

35:31.430 --> 35:32.762
- What am I doing wrong?

35:32.764 --> 35:33.997
Nothing.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.599
People just don't
wanna buy them.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.067
- Who have you approached?

35:37.069 --> 35:38.568
- Everybody Andrei.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.971
If the public doesn't
have a need for the guns,

35:40.973 --> 35:43.373
they're not gonna
purchase the guns.

35:44.243 --> 35:47.177
- Then change need.

35:47.179 --> 35:48.078
- How?

35:49.448 --> 35:53.650
- TV newscasters always like
to report on increasing crime

35:53.652 --> 35:56.820
spreading out from inner
city like Indigent.

35:57.890 --> 36:00.991
A news segment about
home intrusion,

36:00.993 --> 36:05.762
stolen property spreading into
upscale community of Opulent.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.465
Follow that with one
of your commercials.

36:08.467 --> 36:12.802
Increase crime, increase
demand, marketing 101.

36:14.573 --> 36:15.472
Now go do this.

36:24.149 --> 36:26.316
- [Maid] Nelly,
you have a visitor!

36:27.519 --> 36:28.852
- Hi Tom.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.353
- Hey.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.755
I just wanted to stop by
and make sure you're okay.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.657
- I'm okay.

36:33.659 --> 36:35.625
It was just a little scary.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.127
Tom, are you okay?

36:37.129 --> 36:38.728
You look damp.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.969
- Look, don't say
anything, okay?

36:45.971 --> 36:47.537
- [Nelly] You aren't
into those pills

36:47.539 --> 36:49.839
going around school, are you?

36:49.841 --> 36:52.542
- I just wanted to try
it, and just this once.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.244
- I almost lost my
best friend today.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.379
I can't lose you to
something stupid.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.417
- I won't do it
again, I promise.

37:01.753 --> 37:02.652
- Okay.

37:10.395 --> 37:12.062
- You're gonna love this.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.230
- I love this country.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.565
You just get everyone
something to be afraid of

37:15.567 --> 37:17.033
and they throw money at you.

37:20.973 --> 37:23.173
- Crime is spreading
from the inner cities

37:23.175 --> 37:26.509
to our once safe and
elegant neighborhoods.

37:27.846 --> 37:31.214
It's time you protected your
families and loved ones.

37:31.216 --> 37:34.684
Time for you to
take control of your

37:34.686 --> 37:38.355
loved ones and your
property with guns from

37:38.357 --> 37:39.656
Andrei's Gun Shop.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.459
Come down and make a selection.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.994
We're firing away for you.

37:46.665 --> 37:50.400
- Now, go make crime
in neighborhood for
news to report on

37:50.402 --> 37:52.869
and show this commercial
after six o'clock news.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.038
Now go!

37:57.876 --> 37:59.276
I love this country.

37:59.278 --> 38:02.345
(upbeat rock music)

38:05.117 --> 38:06.016
- Hey Frank.

38:07.019 --> 38:07.984
I just wrapped up.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.053
The ring's all yours.

38:11.423 --> 38:14.557
I told the guy to swap out
the ropes for your wrestling.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.595
- I don't know why they
bring in those boxers anyway.

38:18.597 --> 38:22.399
Way too long of a fight,
and all those rules?

38:22.401 --> 38:24.901
- It brings in a different crowd

38:24.903 --> 38:28.872
and more money for the
boss and for us, right?

38:31.443 --> 38:33.710
- Then you got those
damn kick boxers.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.347
- Really Frank?

38:38.350 --> 38:39.683
You really wanna do this?

38:40.452 --> 38:41.384
- What?

38:41.386 --> 38:42.519
- Let's see what you got.

38:42.521 --> 38:43.353
Come on.

38:43.355 --> 38:44.421
No gloves.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.322
- Here we go.

38:46.291 --> 38:47.190
- Gentlemen!

38:48.627 --> 38:49.526
- Good fight.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.394
Angelo.

38:53.265 --> 38:56.633
- I am going to enjoy this,

38:56.635 --> 38:58.935
you two boys in
the ring together.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.171
We're almost sold out.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.709
Andrei wants to bring
in a team for security.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.947
- Why do we need more security?

39:10.949 --> 39:13.717
- [Angelo] For your safety
and your protection.

39:14.553 --> 39:15.518
- Dare I ask?

39:16.621 --> 39:19.689
- Word's got out
pretty far and wide.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.726
There's some guys from LA
who may be showing up here.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.661
They're big-time
offshore betters

39:24.663 --> 39:28.798
and they're also
very sore losers.

39:34.206 --> 39:35.972
- Well you tell
Mr. Mikhailov that

39:37.008 --> 39:38.675
we're very grateful
for the help.

39:48.653 --> 39:51.388
- Do you think the
rumors are true?

39:51.390 --> 39:53.189
- What rumors are those?

39:53.191 --> 39:54.958
- Andrei being a
Russian mob boss?

39:55.727 --> 39:56.626
- No.

39:57.929 --> 40:00.163
I heard he was Russian royalty
or something like that.

40:00.165 --> 40:03.066
- I'm pretty sure, and
Angelo's his brigadier.

40:04.302 --> 40:06.936
- No, no, someone's
pulling your leg, man.

40:08.039 --> 40:09.539
- Wanna bet?

40:09.541 --> 40:11.307
$500.

40:11.309 --> 40:12.208
- $500?

40:13.779 --> 40:15.111
Sure.

40:15.113 --> 40:15.945
I like taking your money.

40:15.947 --> 40:16.846
- Come on.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.084
- So is it a deal?

40:22.854 --> 40:24.354
Yours will be free if you get
enough of your own clients.

40:24.356 --> 40:25.555
There's no risk.

40:25.557 --> 40:26.756
Your contact to
get the stuff looks

40:26.758 --> 40:28.491
as innocent as a
kid in Santa's lap.

40:30.328 --> 40:32.695
Between the pills and
your workout training,

40:32.697 --> 40:34.431
you'll have one of the
hottest bodies in town.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.201
- All right, but do you
think maybe we could do

40:38.203 --> 40:42.305
like a trial run,
maybe a little sample?

40:43.375 --> 40:45.008
- Nothing in life is free, babe.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.478
- Hey buddy, ready to head out?

40:48.480 --> 40:50.046
- Gotta go.

40:50.048 --> 40:51.748
I'll come see you tomorrow
to see if we have a deal.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.251
- New girlfriend?

40:58.390 --> 40:59.306
- Sort of.

40:59.307 --> 41:00.223
- Look, I don't
think I can do this.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.325
- We talked about this.

41:02.327 --> 41:03.560
The sooner we start this,

41:03.562 --> 41:05.662
the sooner we make our
own legit business.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.430
Hey man, you're the one
who wanted fast money

41:07.432 --> 41:09.933
to pay back the
mortgage I paid for you,

41:09.935 --> 41:11.434
but if you don't want to.

41:11.436 --> 41:14.404
- No, I wanna pay it back
as quickly as possible,

41:15.474 --> 41:17.474
but after that, we're
done dealing, right?

41:17.476 --> 41:18.408
- Of course.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.277
- Cool.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.812
- Send these off
at the high school.

41:24.616 --> 41:26.749
- Wait, high school?

41:26.751 --> 41:28.351
Dude, that's messed up.

41:28.353 --> 41:30.153
- They're just pills,
harmless study aids,

41:30.155 --> 41:32.322
high volume cash, it's not blow.

41:33.592 --> 41:34.757
- Who do I give it to?

41:37.028 --> 41:38.127
- His name is Thomas.

41:43.568 --> 41:44.400
All right?

41:44.402 --> 41:45.435
- All right.

41:48.006 --> 41:51.541
(upbeat electronic music)

41:56.681 --> 41:58.114
- Excuse me, Mr. Andrei?

42:00.352 --> 42:01.184
Mr. Andrei.

42:01.186 --> 42:02.385
- What?

42:02.387 --> 42:04.454
- I hear that you are
generous to people

42:04.456 --> 42:06.623
who have certain information.

42:09.761 --> 42:11.127
- Some say.

42:11.129 --> 42:14.931
- And on a side note,
I enjoy your products

42:14.933 --> 42:16.566
and when money allows for it.

42:16.568 --> 42:17.934
- [Andrei] This information?

42:17.936 --> 42:19.335
- It's about your competition.

42:19.337 --> 42:22.405
I hear they have some
really, really good prices.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.175
- Who might my competition be?

42:26.177 --> 42:28.611
- I don't know exactly.

42:28.613 --> 42:31.681
I just hear they're around
and they just started dealing,

42:31.683 --> 42:33.816
but I know some of their pushers

42:33.818 --> 42:35.518
and I know where
they're dealing.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.187
- [Andrei] So if you go for
a ride with one of my boys,

42:38.189 --> 42:40.490
you can show him
who these guys are?

42:40.492 --> 42:41.724
- Yeah, I could do that,

42:41.726 --> 42:44.761
and you'll be able to
show your appreciation?

42:46.565 --> 42:49.766
- Take this man for
a ride in one of your

42:49.768 --> 42:51.367
less conspicuous vehicles.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.002
He'll show you the location
he's talking about.

42:53.004 --> 42:54.304
- Yes sir.

42:54.306 --> 42:56.472
- Then take him to
clean up building.

42:56.474 --> 42:57.507
- Thank you.

42:57.509 --> 42:58.341
Thank you Mr. Andrei.

42:58.343 --> 42:59.609
Hey, hey easy!

43:06.885 --> 43:08.117
- Keep that up man.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.886
Your house will look
like the rest of ours.

43:13.658 --> 43:15.258
- I don't know Donnie.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.694
Sometimes I think about
just giving up, moving.

43:18.797 --> 43:21.130
- Man, I get out of this
hell hole if I could.

43:21.132 --> 43:22.198
- Yeah?

43:22.200 --> 43:23.266
Go where?

43:23.268 --> 43:24.467
- Anywhere, man.

43:24.469 --> 43:26.069
Anything's gotta be
better than this.

43:26.071 --> 43:28.438
(suspenseful music)

43:28.440 --> 43:31.040
Yo, who goes around slamming
windows in broad daylight?

43:31.042 --> 43:31.975
- Look man, just go on your way.

43:31.977 --> 43:33.209
We don't want any trouble.

43:33.211 --> 43:34.043
- Look man, we don't
want any trouble.

43:34.045 --> 43:34.877
- Hey, hey, hey!

43:34.879 --> 43:37.880
(man groans)

43:37.882 --> 43:39.949
- I need an ambulance, fast!

43:39.951 --> 43:41.584
3174 Duff!

43:43.588 --> 43:46.089
(man groans)

43:47.492 --> 43:50.460
- This must be an important
study group at the library.

43:50.462 --> 43:53.196
- Mom, you constantly get after
me to fix up and when I do,

43:53.198 --> 43:54.897
you still can't be pleased.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.067
- Who all are you meeting with?

43:58.069 --> 43:59.769
- [Nelly] Sally's coming
and she's got a friend

43:59.771 --> 44:01.304
my age she wants me to meet.

44:01.306 --> 44:03.172
- And the friend's name?

44:03.174 --> 44:06.175
- Mom, I haven't met her so
why would I know her name?

44:08.580 --> 44:10.013
- It is a school night.

44:10.015 --> 44:10.947
Be home by nine.

44:21.459 --> 44:23.393
- I know that look.

44:23.395 --> 44:26.696
- Don't happen to have an extra
PI hanging around, do you?

44:26.698 --> 44:28.498
- This must be
something really serious

44:28.500 --> 44:30.466
or you're being over dramatic.

44:30.468 --> 44:32.201
- Probably both.

44:32.203 --> 44:35.338
- What brings such a concern
look on your face, my love?

44:35.340 --> 44:38.541
- I know it's silly, but I
think Nelly is lying to me about

44:38.543 --> 44:40.009
her study group tonight.

44:41.846 --> 44:42.745
- I'm on it.

44:47.986 --> 44:51.554
(upbeat electronic music)

44:53.324 --> 44:57.160
My wife is always
suspicious of Nelly.

44:57.162 --> 44:58.995
- And you are not?

44:58.997 --> 45:00.263
- Not at all.

45:00.265 --> 45:02.432
My little baby is
the perfect angel.

45:03.735 --> 45:05.935
Now it's those teenage
boys that are coming over

45:05.937 --> 45:07.837
and that's another story.

45:07.839 --> 45:11.374
- I never have children, but
Katarina, she's like my own.

45:12.744 --> 45:14.711
- Doesn't bother you when
she goes out on a date?

45:14.713 --> 45:16.245
- She doesn't date.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.346
- How do you do that?

45:18.416 --> 45:20.283
- We keep her close
and preoccupied.

45:20.285 --> 45:22.752
We keep her days
and extracurriculars
on a tight schedule

45:22.754 --> 45:24.987
so she can get into
a top university.

45:24.989 --> 45:28.191
She doesn't need to know we
were gonna buy her way in.

45:28.193 --> 45:31.127
Hard work ethic is good
to instill in our youth.

45:31.129 --> 45:32.962
It also kills two
birds, one stone.

45:35.266 --> 45:36.999
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

45:37.001 --> 45:38.568
I have a feeling we
may have a problem

45:38.570 --> 45:41.070
with tonight's entertainment.

45:44.209 --> 45:46.109
The fight will be
publicized and televised

45:46.111 --> 45:47.744
on all the major networks.

45:47.746 --> 45:49.345
(knocking)

45:49.347 --> 45:50.379
Who is it?

45:50.381 --> 45:52.081
- [Angelo] Angelo.

45:52.083 --> 45:52.982
- Come.

45:54.619 --> 45:56.519
- I'm sorry, I don't
wanna interrupt,

45:56.521 --> 45:58.621
but I thought you oughta know.

45:59.991 --> 46:02.625
I just got a call from one of
the guys down at the arena.

46:02.627 --> 46:06.596
Apparently, we have an issue
with one of the wrestlers.

46:07.999 --> 46:10.066
- And you couldn't
just call me because?

46:13.004 --> 46:14.103
Speak!

46:15.540 --> 46:18.908
- Apparently, the guy
wants a bigger cut

46:18.910 --> 46:20.943
and a take of the
other wrestlers.

46:20.945 --> 46:22.912
He says he's a bigger name.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.349
- The egos of these people.

46:26.351 --> 46:28.718
You think we're dealing
with Hollywood actors.

46:30.822 --> 46:34.557
Tell them this, whoever
wins gets double,

46:34.559 --> 46:37.360
but based on the percentage
of the house take-in.

46:37.362 --> 46:40.196
- That just made this
even more interesting.

46:41.299 --> 46:43.366
Put a grand down for
me on the bald guy.

46:44.936 --> 46:46.169
- You'd bet a grand
on some fighter.

46:46.171 --> 46:47.670
You don't even know his name.

46:48.540 --> 46:50.106
- Woman's intuition.

46:52.544 --> 46:55.545
- Let us hope it is
not inside information.

46:55.547 --> 46:58.247
You know, maybe something
Andrei should know?

46:58.249 --> 46:59.482
- Yes.

46:59.484 --> 47:01.217
I only bet when I
know I will win.

47:04.055 --> 47:07.356
First, ringside advantage.

47:07.358 --> 47:09.158
He knows your ropes.

47:09.160 --> 47:11.460
Plus, he's had a few
years to perfect his moves

47:11.462 --> 47:12.361
in your arena.

47:14.666 --> 47:15.565
- Go on.

47:16.701 --> 47:18.868
- The opponent is
afraid of you and

47:18.870 --> 47:20.903
you'll be sitting ringside.

47:20.905 --> 47:24.073
His manager is putting
the pressure on him

47:24.075 --> 47:26.342
by threatening him
and if he doesn't win,

47:26.344 --> 47:27.410
he's gonna drop him.

47:28.713 --> 47:30.213
That adds to his distraction.

47:32.517 --> 47:36.018
- I pity the man who
would underestimate you.

47:37.989 --> 47:39.956
They wouldn't stand a chance.

47:39.958 --> 47:42.091
(man laughs)

47:42.093 --> 47:43.092
You can go.

47:49.934 --> 47:51.033
- There you go.

47:51.035 --> 47:51.868
Nice.

47:51.870 --> 47:52.768
Nice.

47:53.838 --> 47:54.737
There you go.

47:56.107 --> 47:57.607
Hold on, hold on.

47:58.676 --> 47:59.575
Got it.

48:00.645 --> 48:03.546
Let's go, let's go.

48:03.548 --> 48:06.015
There we go, there we go!

48:10.722 --> 48:11.621
Talk later.

48:14.692 --> 48:15.892
What's this about?

48:15.894 --> 48:18.027
- Fuck you think this
is about wise guy?

48:19.097 --> 48:21.264
- Look, I didn't help
out with anything

48:21.266 --> 48:22.865
and I didn't agree to anything.

48:26.504 --> 48:31.407
- We want to enlist
you...for a sting operation,

48:31.409 --> 48:32.575
at least for this one.

48:34.312 --> 48:35.711
- I'm sorry, why me?

48:35.713 --> 48:37.113
- Your record's clean.

48:37.115 --> 48:38.581
You've got no connections
as far as we could

48:38.583 --> 48:42.618
discover that would
compromise an investigation.

48:43.688 --> 48:45.288
- What investigation?

48:45.290 --> 48:46.322
- Andrei Mikhailov.

48:47.458 --> 48:49.125
- You mean to tell me
the stories are true?

48:49.127 --> 48:50.559
He's really Russian mafia?

48:50.561 --> 48:53.195
- Let's just say he's
a person of interest.

48:54.332 --> 48:56.198
- We need your help.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.800
- We need somebody
he's seen around

48:57.802 --> 48:59.902
enough to be on the inside,

48:59.904 --> 49:02.338
but with no allegiance
to the drug war.

49:02.340 --> 49:04.640
Do you consent to help us?

49:04.642 --> 49:07.643
- Look, I don't advocate
criminal activity,
but I'm no rat.

49:08.980 --> 49:11.013
- What about the drug sales?

49:13.184 --> 49:16.118
We know all about
your transgressions.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.753
It's all on tape.

49:17.755 --> 49:19.322
- Look, you've got
the cleanest record

49:19.324 --> 49:21.157
of anybody you hang with.

49:21.159 --> 49:22.959
If you wanna keep it that way,

49:22.961 --> 49:25.227
you'll help us with
this investigation.

49:27.398 --> 49:28.898
- There's no danger involved?

49:29.701 --> 49:31.467
- Follow all our directions.

49:31.469 --> 49:32.535
You'll be just fine.

49:35.073 --> 49:36.305
You'll be wearing this.

49:38.876 --> 49:39.709
- Jesus.

49:39.711 --> 49:40.543
- That's to your phone.

49:40.545 --> 49:42.244
We'll use a roving bug,

49:42.246 --> 49:46.082
can be activated remotely
without any physical access.

49:46.084 --> 49:51.153
- We'll contact you,
discreetly, if we need anything,

49:52.357 --> 49:53.789
so keep your phone close.

49:56.494 --> 49:57.660
Be ready for our call.

50:10.041 --> 50:11.707
- [Maya] As much
as I'm enjoying the

50:11.709 --> 50:15.544
breakaway from the club, I get
the sense that this is more

50:15.546 --> 50:18.080
than just a girl's
afternoon out.

50:20.118 --> 50:23.052
- I don't know why the boys
don't give you more credit.

50:24.122 --> 50:25.955
You're smarter
than your station.

50:28.292 --> 50:30.159
- I like to keep
them on their toes.

50:32.430 --> 50:35.097
- You know, you are
the only one who isn't

50:35.099 --> 50:36.665
afraid to speak freely.

50:38.236 --> 50:39.301
Brave choice.

50:40.738 --> 50:43.639
Are you happy working here?

50:45.376 --> 50:47.376
- Women in my
position have learned

50:47.378 --> 50:49.145
to not think about happy.

50:52.417 --> 50:56.986
- Are you satisfied being
here, working for Andrei?

50:59.223 --> 51:02.558
- I appreciate the generosities
your family has extended me

51:02.560 --> 51:04.160
by giving me this position.

51:06.164 --> 51:09.065
- And by being where you are,

51:09.067 --> 51:14.136
you have a lot of dirty work
to cover whenever necessary.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.441
If you were able
to earn a living

51:18.443 --> 51:23.112
without having to answer to
Andrei, would you take it?

51:25.783 --> 51:28.851
- Like I said before, I
appreciate the generosities

51:28.853 --> 51:30.419
your family has extended me.

51:31.556 --> 51:34.590
I'll well paid and I
consider this home,

51:34.592 --> 51:36.492
but I know if I try to leave,

51:36.494 --> 51:40.129
one phone call to
immigration and I'm gone.

51:43.634 --> 51:46.602
- And Andrei holds that
threat over your head?

51:50.708 --> 51:52.708
Maya, let's talk soon.

51:55.213 --> 51:58.447
I might have an alternative
situation for you.

52:04.956 --> 52:06.889
- We can't possibly
cater both the

52:06.891 --> 52:09.925
wrestling event and
the after party.

52:09.927 --> 52:10.960
- Hire more people.

52:12.463 --> 52:13.596
- That's not possible.

52:13.598 --> 52:14.830
There's not enough time.

52:14.832 --> 52:17.066
My kitchen staff can't
handle both events.

52:18.035 --> 52:19.101
- I was not asking.

52:21.572 --> 52:22.838
Leave it on the counter.

52:27.078 --> 52:29.044
- Hey Maya, have you
heard from Lance?

52:30.348 --> 52:32.248
He hasn't showed up to
work for the past two days.

52:32.250 --> 52:34.817
I tried calling his
cellphone, he didn't answer.

52:34.819 --> 52:36.785
- The other day when he
was in Andrei's office,

52:36.787 --> 52:38.187
he had to take a
personal phone call.

52:39.357 --> 52:40.289
Family emergency.

52:42.293 --> 52:43.893
If you excuse me, I
have to work out some

52:43.895 --> 52:45.995
things for the events.

52:45.997 --> 52:46.896
Jing!

52:52.970 --> 52:53.802
Yes.

52:55.540 --> 52:57.740
Rick's asking about Lance.

52:58.976 --> 53:00.509
Of course.

53:00.511 --> 53:01.310
Will do.

53:02.647 --> 53:06.215
(upbeat electronic music)

53:09.720 --> 53:11.453
- That should do it.

53:11.455 --> 53:13.088
Have you confirmed with
the temp staff people

53:13.090 --> 53:14.823
for the servers and
the kitchen help?

53:14.825 --> 53:15.658
- Yes ma'am.

53:15.660 --> 53:16.559
- Good.

53:18.396 --> 53:19.795
Hi honey.

53:19.797 --> 53:21.764
You look nice today.

53:21.766 --> 53:22.898
- I have a job interview.

53:22.900 --> 53:25.301
- Your father would be so proud.

53:25.303 --> 53:26.936
- Why is he doing this?

53:26.938 --> 53:29.405
- [Sandra] Jason, most
young men are already

53:29.407 --> 53:31.473
climbing the corporate ladder.

53:31.475 --> 53:32.975
You're a bright boy.

53:32.977 --> 53:34.843
You need to get
your career started.

53:35.846 --> 53:37.346
- This is one interview
you can't miss.

53:37.348 --> 53:39.181
- [Sandra] I didn't know
you'd be home so early.

53:39.183 --> 53:40.983
- Well I miss my beautiful wife.

53:40.985 --> 53:42.218
(woman giggles)

53:42.220 --> 53:44.587
- See, you should be
more like your father.

53:44.589 --> 53:46.255
- He's not my father.

53:46.257 --> 53:47.523
- What was that?

53:47.525 --> 53:49.525
- Actually, I have
been interviewing.

53:49.527 --> 53:52.461
I just haven't found
anything that fits yet.

53:52.463 --> 53:55.564
- Whatever you choose,
I'm sure they'll love you.

53:57.034 --> 53:58.067
- You haven't reached
out to any of the

53:58.069 --> 53:59.368
contacts I've given you.

54:00.538 --> 54:01.670
You don't have an
allowance coming in,

54:01.672 --> 54:03.372
yet you have money to spend.

54:03.374 --> 54:04.873
Something doesn't add up.

54:06.410 --> 54:07.910
- You probably won't like it,

54:07.912 --> 54:10.746
but I took money from
the fund grandpa left me.

54:10.748 --> 54:12.214
It's my money!

54:13.884 --> 54:16.752
(phone rings)

54:16.754 --> 54:17.653
- Hello.

54:18.889 --> 54:20.222
- [Andrei] I hear a
congratulations were in order.

54:20.224 --> 54:21.657
- For what?

54:21.659 --> 54:23.759
- [Andrei] The gun
shop, my friend.

54:23.761 --> 54:26.228
- So many regulations
just to have

54:26.230 --> 54:28.897
a few semi-automatic
firearms in my store.

54:30.234 --> 54:32.034
- [Andrei] Now you are
legitimate weapons dealer,

54:32.036 --> 54:33.535
first one in our town.

54:34.872 --> 54:36.739
Will I see you and Sandra
tonight at the fight?

54:36.741 --> 54:38.007
- Yeah, you will.

54:43.581 --> 54:45.914
(gunshots)

54:48.653 --> 54:50.619
- Tatiana, Tatiana!

54:50.621 --> 54:52.354
(man speaking in
foreign language)

54:52.356 --> 54:53.355
Tatiana, I will never
leave your side ever again.

54:55.326 --> 54:56.825
- Andrei?

54:56.827 --> 54:59.962
- Tatiana, I waited so long
to hear your beautiful voice.

55:01.565 --> 55:04.199
Come on, let's get
your downstairs.

55:04.201 --> 55:07.269
(audience cheering)

55:20.685 --> 55:23.085
- Please, go, go mingle.

55:23.921 --> 55:24.853
I'm fine here.

55:25.856 --> 55:27.222
- The boss' orders, ma'am.

55:31.228 --> 55:34.663
- So many things have changed.

55:35.766 --> 55:38.033
Andrei has changed.

55:38.035 --> 55:40.035
- He's had to deal with
a grave of many issues

55:40.037 --> 55:40.936
in your absence.

55:43.007 --> 55:46.075
(audience cheering)

55:49.547 --> 55:52.481
- Olga has told me how
kind he's been to them

55:53.918 --> 55:58.987
and this event, it's so
out of character for him

56:00.257 --> 56:02.891
to have a business that's
so people oriented.

56:03.961 --> 56:05.427
- Now that you mentioned it.

56:06.697 --> 56:08.230
What happened to you?

56:08.232 --> 56:10.032
You've been demoted?

56:10.034 --> 56:11.266
- No.

56:11.268 --> 56:13.001
Mr. Mikhailov asked
me to cover security,

56:13.003 --> 56:15.671
observe any unusual guests.

56:15.673 --> 56:16.572
It's my cover.

56:17.942 --> 56:19.108
- Cover.

56:19.110 --> 56:20.042
(woman laughs)

56:20.044 --> 56:22.244
Some things never change.

56:23.581 --> 56:27.383
- Restaurants and sporting
events, cutthroat industries.

56:28.452 --> 56:31.353
- Especially in a wild
town like Opulent.

56:35.526 --> 56:37.659
- Is this crowd
too much for you?

56:41.432 --> 56:42.681
- Nyet.

56:42.682 --> 56:43.931
It's just opposite,
it's invigorating.

56:46.437 --> 56:48.470
- You always did
enjoy the social life.

56:51.375 --> 56:56.111
- And I'm delighted you
made one while I was away.

56:56.113 --> 56:59.181
(audience cheering)

57:05.122 --> 57:07.156
- Now that you're
in capable hands,

57:07.158 --> 57:09.024
men, if you'll excuse me.

57:10.127 --> 57:11.860
I'm gonna go check
on the kitchen,

57:11.862 --> 57:16.365
make sure they're keeping
up with the after party.

57:16.367 --> 57:19.435
(audience cheering)

57:24.375 --> 57:25.607
(woman yelling)

57:25.609 --> 57:27.109
- [Bouncer] Hey man,
let the ladies go!

57:27.111 --> 57:30.145
- [Man] Hey man, I paid extra
money for this good service!

57:30.147 --> 57:32.247
They both taking me on a ride!

57:32.249 --> 57:33.482
(woman speaking in
foreign language)

57:33.484 --> 57:36.485
(record scratches)

57:39.523 --> 57:43.125
- Hey man, I've heard
rumor this stuff existed.

57:43.127 --> 57:45.160
I didn't think it was true.

57:45.162 --> 57:48.063
- I think it's best if
you just forget about it.

57:48.065 --> 57:49.832
- But those girls,
they were pretty young.

57:50.868 --> 57:53.001
- If it's any
consolation to you,

57:53.003 --> 57:56.138
they're both legal age and
in three months from now,

57:56.140 --> 57:59.641
they're gonna go back to
Mexico with a box full of cash.

57:59.643 --> 58:01.844
- And that makes it okay?

58:01.846 --> 58:04.179
- Let's pretend
it never happened.

58:04.181 --> 58:07.749
(upbeat electronic music)

58:28.472 --> 58:30.005
- I'm so glad you
came out tonight.

58:30.007 --> 58:32.574
I'm really surprised your
parents were okay with it.

58:32.576 --> 58:34.776
- Actually, they
don't know I'm here.

58:34.778 --> 58:36.078
Everyone's at the fight.

58:37.181 --> 58:38.680
- Look at Nelly,
our little rebel.

58:39.884 --> 58:41.984
- [Man] Hey, got anything?

58:43.053 --> 58:44.486
- Hey man, not cool.

58:44.488 --> 58:46.121
Come back tomorrow.

58:46.123 --> 58:47.589
- Tomorrow won't work.

58:47.591 --> 58:49.224
- I'll be right back.

58:49.226 --> 58:51.026
- Are you okay with this?

58:51.028 --> 58:52.227
- With what?

58:52.229 --> 58:53.161
- What JJ's doing.

58:53.163 --> 58:54.730
- With him, it's no big deal.

58:54.732 --> 58:57.299
His friend's just
shy with girls.

58:57.301 --> 58:58.133
- I know what he's doing.

58:58.135 --> 58:59.034
He's dealing.

59:02.907 --> 59:04.239
- Hey guys, sorry about that.

59:04.241 --> 59:05.607
You want another one, man?

59:06.777 --> 59:08.277
It's the last one I have.

59:08.279 --> 59:10.045
- [Nelly] Tom,
what are you doing?

59:16.854 --> 59:17.686
- Hey man, chill.

59:17.688 --> 59:18.587
It's the last one.

59:19.456 --> 59:20.389
- Are you okay?

59:21.258 --> 59:24.426
- Just a little lightheaded.

59:24.428 --> 59:25.694
I'll be good.

59:25.696 --> 59:27.796
- Maybe you should lay
down on the way home.

59:28.666 --> 59:29.831
- You'll be okay, man.

59:41.412 --> 59:44.913
- He's not breathing,
he's not breathing!

59:50.955 --> 59:53.288
- I need to know what
happened and now!

59:53.290 --> 59:56.091
- He just got sick so
we brought him here.

59:56.093 --> 59:58.961
- [Sandra] Is there anything
else you're not telling us?

59:59.997 --> 1:00:01.530
- [Doctor] Are you the parents?

1:00:01.532 --> 1:00:02.898
- We're Nelly's parents.

1:00:02.900 --> 1:00:05.167
I called Tom's parents,
but there was no answer.

1:00:05.169 --> 1:00:06.902
I sent a driver over there.

1:00:06.904 --> 1:00:08.136
- Is he gonna be okay?

1:00:08.138 --> 1:00:09.972
- I really need to
speak to the parents.

1:00:09.974 --> 1:00:10.939
Tom took fentanyl.

1:00:12.309 --> 1:00:14.843
- God, we moved here to
get away from that stuff!

1:00:14.845 --> 1:00:16.244
The doctor said
Tom took fentanyl.

1:00:16.246 --> 1:00:17.412
Do you know where
he's getting this?

1:00:17.414 --> 1:00:19.114
- He said he would stop!

1:00:19.116 --> 1:00:20.115
- Are you taking it?

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:21.350
- No, I promise I'm not!

1:00:21.352 --> 1:00:22.551
I haven't taken any drugs!

1:00:22.553 --> 1:00:24.553
- Why haven't you
told us about this?

1:00:24.555 --> 1:00:25.654
- Not now, Rami.

1:00:25.656 --> 1:00:26.788
- I really need to get back.

1:00:26.790 --> 1:00:27.889
It doesn't look good.

1:00:31.028 --> 1:00:34.596
(upbeat electronic music)

1:01:00.324 --> 1:01:02.824
- This place is a goddamn mess!

1:01:02.826 --> 1:01:04.493
The tables are all set wrong!

1:01:05.796 --> 1:01:07.529
Get your shit together!

1:01:08.766 --> 1:01:09.698
Where's Maya?

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:10.932
She should be here by now!

1:01:12.403 --> 1:01:13.335
- I'm right here.

1:01:13.337 --> 1:01:15.570
- I leave you three messages!

1:01:16.674 --> 1:01:17.906
- Well I'm here.

1:01:19.977 --> 1:01:20.776
It's only 9AM.

1:01:20.777 --> 1:01:21.576
- You know, today's
an important meeting.

1:01:21.578 --> 1:01:24.346
You gotta go beyond the norm
and you know it's important!

1:01:24.348 --> 1:01:26.081
- It's the monthly
boss' meeting!

1:01:26.083 --> 1:01:27.649
What's so different about today?

1:01:27.651 --> 1:01:29.751
- I'm sorry, when you
think it's your job

1:01:29.753 --> 1:01:31.086
to ask me questions?

1:01:31.088 --> 1:01:32.788
Save your lip for the johns!

1:01:34.725 --> 1:01:35.524
- [Olga] Brother.

1:01:35.526 --> 1:01:36.358
- Not now Olga!

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:37.259
- Tense as always.

1:01:39.163 --> 1:01:42.264
- I should know better than
to rile him up like that.

1:01:43.567 --> 1:01:47.102
- That's my favorite
time to get him riled up.

1:01:47.104 --> 1:01:49.004
Big boss is coming today.

1:01:49.006 --> 1:01:51.573
- And since no one knows
who the big boss is,

1:01:51.575 --> 1:01:53.341
he's totally out of his element.

1:01:54.912 --> 1:01:57.779
- I think I'll sit
in on this one.

1:01:57.781 --> 1:02:00.215
- You know how he feels
about women in business.

1:02:02.653 --> 1:02:05.153
- And that's why I am where I am

1:02:06.056 --> 1:02:07.789
and you are where you are.

1:02:16.433 --> 1:02:17.966
- I'll call this
meeting to order

1:02:17.968 --> 1:02:20.635
since our mystery guest of
honor seems to be delayed.

1:02:24.641 --> 1:02:25.540
Yes sir.

1:02:27.811 --> 1:02:30.846
Yes sir, everyone is here
except for the Pakhan.

1:02:32.216 --> 1:02:34.516
- I was the brigadier
on the phone.

1:02:34.518 --> 1:02:38.220
Andrei heard a rumor that
big boss was coming in.

1:02:38.222 --> 1:02:40.288
Brigadier doesn't want
us to embarrass him,

1:02:40.290 --> 1:02:41.890
be kind to the
boss of all bosses.

1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:45.727
- Thank you for the information.

1:02:47.097 --> 1:02:51.099
You know, we women don't
always know these things.

1:02:51.101 --> 1:02:54.302
(dreary violin music)

1:03:07.451 --> 1:03:08.350
- Come in!

1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:18.927
So, what does this mean?

1:03:20.697 --> 1:03:22.798
Why you keep me in the dark?

1:03:23.934 --> 1:03:27.302
We may not get along,
but we are still family,

1:03:27.304 --> 1:03:30.839
and you, the Pakhan,
boss of all bosses!

1:03:30.841 --> 1:03:32.541
How does this make me look?

1:03:35.479 --> 1:03:37.679
- You are getting very sloppy.

1:03:39.216 --> 1:03:40.115
- Sloppy?

1:03:42.519 --> 1:03:45.353
- Andrei, (woman speaks
in foreign language).

1:03:47.724 --> 1:03:50.425
You are completely distracted,

1:03:50.427 --> 1:03:52.227
how you spread the story that

1:03:52.229 --> 1:03:55.130
Tatiana was on vacation
when in reality,

1:03:55.132 --> 1:03:58.266
she was bed bound and in
stupor most of the time.

1:03:59.503 --> 1:04:03.605
The FBI has been tailing
and you provoke them?

1:04:05.909 --> 1:04:09.377
Now there's the disappearance
of some of your working girls.

1:04:09.379 --> 1:04:10.412
Shall I go on?

1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:18.436
- No.

1:04:18.437 --> 1:04:19.753
- You are completely
losing your edge.

1:04:21.158 --> 1:04:24.326
You are being dangerous
to be in business with.

1:04:24.328 --> 1:04:27.062
Word is, you're under
surveillance by several

1:04:27.064 --> 1:04:28.463
government entities.

1:04:29.566 --> 1:04:31.700
- If you mean the
men in the van,

1:04:31.702 --> 1:04:33.235
I took care of that.

1:04:35.172 --> 1:04:36.571
- You took care of that.

1:04:38.308 --> 1:04:40.542
You don't think two
FBI men gone missing

1:04:40.544 --> 1:04:43.245
is not gonna alert
them that you're

1:04:43.247 --> 1:04:44.980
more than a person of interest?

1:04:49.553 --> 1:04:51.720
There are going to
be some changes.

1:04:53.624 --> 1:04:55.190
I'll send the word out to you.

1:04:57.427 --> 1:05:00.629
Us bosses, we don't
like loose ends.

1:05:02.199 --> 1:05:05.367
(light upbeat music)

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:31.326
- It's my grandpa.

1:05:32.396 --> 1:05:33.929
That's the day he moved in.

1:05:33.931 --> 1:05:36.331
- Now I know where you get that
sappy personality of yours.

1:05:36.333 --> 1:05:37.232
Inherited it.

1:05:38.168 --> 1:05:39.067
- I wish.

1:05:40.270 --> 1:05:41.169
He was the best.

1:05:44.041 --> 1:05:46.074
I got something to show you.

1:05:46.076 --> 1:05:47.709
Hang on.

1:05:47.711 --> 1:05:49.511
- What are you doing?

1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:51.413
You moving furniture?

1:05:51.415 --> 1:05:52.247
- Hold on a second.

1:05:52.249 --> 1:05:53.715
Here, check this out.

1:06:00.958 --> 1:06:02.590
It's his, it's original.

1:06:02.592 --> 1:06:04.426
- This looks like it
belongs in a museum.

1:06:05.896 --> 1:06:07.095
Why didn't they
move away from here

1:06:07.097 --> 1:06:08.997
when the neighborhood
started to change?

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:10.899
- I don't know.

1:06:12.302 --> 1:06:14.302
I think they always thought
my dad was gonna come back.

1:06:16.239 --> 1:06:17.839
Part of me still does.

1:06:23.747 --> 1:06:26.281
I got something I gotta
talk to you about.

1:06:27.351 --> 1:06:29.150
- That phrase never
leads to anywhere good,

1:06:29.152 --> 1:06:31.219
at least not when
my parents say it.

1:06:31.221 --> 1:06:32.787
- It's about the drug dealing.

1:06:33.890 --> 1:06:37.192
I just can't do it with you.

1:06:37.194 --> 1:06:39.995
That goes against everything
my grandparents stood for,

1:06:41.164 --> 1:06:42.597
like that kid.

1:06:42.599 --> 1:06:45.867
Remember that kid Thomas,
made the delivery?

1:06:47.871 --> 1:06:51.239
That was supposed
to be harmless.

1:06:53.977 --> 1:06:56.478
Look, I just can't live with
that on my conscious, man.

1:06:58.615 --> 1:07:00.982
- I guess I could take
lower monthly payments,

1:07:00.984 --> 1:07:05.120
something that works with
your current salaries.

1:07:05.922 --> 1:07:07.689
- Really, you'd do that?

1:07:07.691 --> 1:07:08.523
- You're my friend.

1:07:08.525 --> 1:07:09.557
That's what friends do.

1:07:12.796 --> 1:07:14.329
- Thanks, man.

1:07:14.331 --> 1:07:15.230
I appreciate it.

1:07:15.232 --> 1:07:16.564
- I'm gonna take off.

1:07:16.566 --> 1:07:17.499
- No, absolutely.

1:07:17.501 --> 1:07:18.233
- We'll work it out, okay?

1:07:18.235 --> 1:07:19.467
- Absolutely.

1:07:19.469 --> 1:07:21.069
Thanks man, I appreciate that.

1:07:21.071 --> 1:07:22.137
Hit me up later.

1:07:27.511 --> 1:07:28.410
- Hey Jason.

1:07:30.213 --> 1:07:31.112
- Hey Angelo.

1:07:32.749 --> 1:07:34.549
- Ricky, hi.

1:07:35.919 --> 1:07:38.586
I got your address from
the court clerk's office.

1:07:41.658 --> 1:07:43.191
How long have you lived here?

1:07:44.761 --> 1:07:45.660
- All my life.

1:07:49.199 --> 1:07:50.765
- What was your mother's name?

1:07:52.069 --> 1:07:52.967
- My mom?

1:07:54.771 --> 1:07:56.204
- Was your mom named Rose?

1:07:57.674 --> 1:07:58.573
Rose?

1:07:59.543 --> 1:08:00.742
- How'd you know that?

1:08:01.845 --> 1:08:04.412
- It was on the title,
the clerk's office.

1:08:06.149 --> 1:08:07.048
Your dad.

1:08:08.819 --> 1:08:10.752
- I just call him deadbeat dad.

1:08:12.022 --> 1:08:15.757
My mom wrote him a lot
when he was in 'Nam.

1:08:15.759 --> 1:08:16.825
He never responded.

1:08:17.994 --> 1:08:18.893
Never came back.

1:08:25.135 --> 1:08:26.201
- I'm sorry.

1:08:27.871 --> 1:08:32.273
Andrei wanted you to have
this for the nice work.

1:08:32.275 --> 1:08:33.541
- Thanks, thanks.

1:08:35.712 --> 1:08:36.611
Come on in.

1:08:41.918 --> 1:08:44.352
You can come all the way in.

1:08:44.354 --> 1:08:45.687
It's not haunted.

1:08:46.790 --> 1:08:48.890
You look like you're
ready to see a ghost.

1:08:57.467 --> 1:08:58.766
- We need to talk.

1:09:00.737 --> 1:09:02.270
- I know.

1:09:02.272 --> 1:09:05.440
I really wanna find
a way to keep my job,

1:09:05.442 --> 1:09:07.942
but in all honesty, Angelo,

1:09:07.944 --> 1:09:10.678
I can't condone what's going on.

1:09:11.581 --> 1:09:13.448
I don't even
understand how you can.

1:09:13.450 --> 1:09:15.750
- If not me, somebody else.

1:09:18.155 --> 1:09:21.689
- You're there by choice with
that piece of shit Andrei.

1:09:21.691 --> 1:09:23.525
- Andrei saved my life.

1:09:26.129 --> 1:09:28.329
I was in a bad place once.

1:09:28.331 --> 1:09:30.231
He gave me this job.

1:09:30.233 --> 1:09:32.200
I owe him a lot.

1:09:32.202 --> 1:09:33.568
- Then who are you really?

1:09:36.473 --> 1:09:37.672
- I was in the 'Nam.

1:09:39.109 --> 1:09:41.476
Six months in and
I got captured.

1:09:41.478 --> 1:09:43.211
(man chuckles)

1:09:43.213 --> 1:09:45.914
Spent the next five
years in a cage,

1:09:45.916 --> 1:09:49.217
eating rats, getting my
ass kicked every day.

1:09:49.219 --> 1:09:50.585
- [Rick] Jesus.

1:09:50.587 --> 1:09:52.287
- I should've died.

1:09:53.723 --> 1:09:54.889
I was dead already.

1:09:56.626 --> 1:09:58.993
When I came home,
it was even worse.

1:09:59.896 --> 1:10:01.162
Everything was broken.

1:10:04.401 --> 1:10:06.768
My mother and father,
they passed away.

1:10:08.271 --> 1:10:10.438
My sister moved on.

1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:13.174
She didn't want any part of me.

1:10:13.176 --> 1:10:14.209
I don't blame her.

1:10:16.646 --> 1:10:19.781
But there's only one person
that I wanted to see,

1:10:21.785 --> 1:10:26.854
that I needed to see,
and I didn't, I couldn't.

1:10:29.626 --> 1:10:31.659
She's the only thing
that kept me going.

1:10:34.197 --> 1:10:37.966
I tried once, I tried once.

1:10:39.369 --> 1:10:44.272
Drove out to her house, she
was sitting on her porch.

1:10:45.408 --> 1:10:46.241
She didn't see me
so I pulled over

1:10:46.243 --> 1:10:47.242
to the side of the road.

1:10:49.312 --> 1:10:50.511
I just watched.

1:10:52.482 --> 1:10:55.416
She hadn't changed a bit
from the moment I left.

1:10:58.021 --> 1:11:00.221
Then a little kid runs
out yelling mommy,

1:11:01.324 --> 1:11:03.057
mommy, look what I made.

1:11:07.097 --> 1:11:08.896
I wasn't gonna
interfere with that.

1:11:10.700 --> 1:11:12.267
I would've just screwed it up.

1:11:17.707 --> 1:11:18.673
- I guess you know
what it feels like

1:11:18.675 --> 1:11:20.041
to lose everyone you love.

1:11:27.517 --> 1:11:28.416
- I gotta go.

1:11:30.487 --> 1:11:32.153
Someday you can
buy me a beer and

1:11:32.155 --> 1:11:34.756
tell me all about that
beautiful mother of yours.

1:11:36.426 --> 1:11:37.659
Nice work, Ricky.

1:11:39.529 --> 1:11:40.395
- Thanks.

1:11:46.136 --> 1:11:50.204
- Tatiana, I am so
happy you recovered from

1:11:50.206 --> 1:11:51.539
the attack, Tatiana.

1:11:52.642 --> 1:11:55.076
You have always
been a good friend.

1:11:56.479 --> 1:12:00.048
- Seeing the two of you
makes me feel even better.

1:12:01.351 --> 1:12:03.351
- Uncle has told you the plans?

1:12:05.021 --> 1:12:08.256
- He said something
about fresh start.

1:12:10.293 --> 1:12:13.127
(woman speaking in
foreign language)

1:12:13.129 --> 1:12:16.531
- You have always been
one of my closest friends.

1:12:17.901 --> 1:12:22.203
After such horrific attempts
on your life and your family,

1:12:23.306 --> 1:12:26.774
I don't feel that it's
safe for you to be here.

1:12:27.911 --> 1:12:30.211
- [Andrei] Did I hear
my name mentioned?

1:12:30.213 --> 1:12:31.846
- Da baby.

1:12:31.848 --> 1:12:35.083
Olga is talking about
relocation plan.

1:12:36.219 --> 1:12:37.518
- Seems timely, my dear.

1:12:39.022 --> 1:12:40.288
I just have a couple
things to put into place,

1:12:40.290 --> 1:12:42.023
and then we'll be
free to travel.

1:12:43.026 --> 1:12:44.859
- That does not sound like you.

1:12:47.263 --> 1:12:52.266
- After the attack, I don't
want to take anymore chances.

1:12:53.903 --> 1:12:55.269
- So enchanting.

1:12:56.306 --> 1:12:59.841
(upbeat electronic music)

1:13:01.644 --> 1:13:02.643
- Where's Angelo?

1:13:03.747 --> 1:13:05.380
- I think he's in
back with Maya.

1:13:05.382 --> 1:13:06.347
- Find him.

1:13:06.349 --> 1:13:07.515
Tell him to come to my office.

1:13:17.327 --> 1:13:19.193
- I've come into
some information

1:13:19.195 --> 1:13:20.728
that is very upsetting to me.

1:13:22.365 --> 1:13:23.431
- What information?

1:13:26.403 --> 1:13:28.136
- There is a mole in our circle.

1:13:28.138 --> 1:13:29.537
- A mole?

1:13:32.876 --> 1:13:33.858
Come on.

1:13:33.859 --> 1:13:34.841
- I want you to find
him and I want it

1:13:36.212 --> 1:13:39.981
finished before the day is
over, you understand me?

1:13:39.983 --> 1:13:40.882
- Absolutely.

1:13:41.785 --> 1:13:44.652
What information do we have?

1:13:44.654 --> 1:13:46.421
- Information is your job!

1:13:46.423 --> 1:13:48.923
Otherwise, what
do I need you for?

1:13:48.925 --> 1:13:50.691
Now you do this
job for me or not?

1:13:52.929 --> 1:13:54.695
- Yes, sir.

1:13:55.932 --> 1:14:01.035
I won't disappoint.

1:14:07.477 --> 1:14:08.376
I'll wait.

1:14:14.017 --> 1:14:15.683
- Here.

1:14:15.685 --> 1:14:17.351
We've been keeping
an eye on him.

1:14:19.923 --> 1:14:22.089
- It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

1:14:30.867 --> 1:14:31.933
Hi Ricky.

1:14:33.169 --> 1:14:36.304
I need to see you, quick.

1:14:36.306 --> 1:14:37.972
I could use another hand.

1:14:40.009 --> 1:14:41.576
I'll swing by and pick you up.

1:15:20.550 --> 1:15:22.383
- Americans could
never fully appreciate

1:15:22.385 --> 1:15:24.485
the spontaneous use of violence.

1:15:27.991 --> 1:15:29.957
I would never have
guessed you were my mole.

1:15:31.060 --> 1:15:32.760
I guess that's what
makes you so good.

1:15:32.762 --> 1:15:33.694
- I'm not the rat.

1:15:33.696 --> 1:15:35.129
I swear, honest.

1:15:35.131 --> 1:15:37.231
They approached me, they
threatened me with drug charges.

1:15:37.233 --> 1:15:38.533
I didn't tell them anything!

1:15:38.535 --> 1:15:41.836
- Come on Andrei,
he's just a kid.

1:15:41.838 --> 1:15:43.838
Let's cut him some slack.

1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:47.508
He could've said a lot more
and he kept his mouth shut.

1:15:47.510 --> 1:15:48.709
That's worth something.

1:15:51.281 --> 1:15:55.082
- Seeing as you're my rat
and the FBI needs a dealer,

1:15:55.084 --> 1:15:57.285
why don't we kill two
birds with one stone?

1:15:58.421 --> 1:16:00.955
Find out what Rick's
true loyalties lie.

1:16:00.957 --> 1:16:02.390
- What do you have in mind?

1:16:02.392 --> 1:16:05.059
- For reasons beyond my
control, I need to disappear.

1:16:05.061 --> 1:16:06.594
You'll help me with that I won't

1:16:06.596 --> 1:16:09.797
shoot you where you stand for
bringing the cops to my door!

1:16:09.799 --> 1:16:12.166
- How are we gonna
pull that off?

1:16:12.168 --> 1:16:13.067
- I have plan.

1:16:15.138 --> 1:16:16.304
Give this to the feds.

1:16:17.407 --> 1:16:18.906
Tell him I'll be
here in my office

1:16:18.908 --> 1:16:23.611
alone until 1PM tomorrow, and
I will be alone and unarmed.

1:16:25.415 --> 1:16:26.981
- [Rick] Wait, I
don't understand.

1:16:26.983 --> 1:16:29.317
- You don't need to understand.

1:16:29.319 --> 1:16:30.217
Now go!

1:16:41.130 --> 1:16:43.564
- Hey Mikhailov, we got a
warrant for your arrest.

1:16:43.566 --> 1:16:45.566
Get your ass up
you piece of shit.

1:16:46.736 --> 1:16:48.169
- Get up!

1:16:48.171 --> 1:16:49.170
- [Agent] Been waiting a
fucking long time for this.

1:16:51.441 --> 1:16:52.373
- Let's move!

1:16:52.375 --> 1:16:53.374
Move it!

1:16:53.376 --> 1:16:54.442
- Shake this son
of a bitch down.

1:16:54.444 --> 1:16:57.612
We got you, you piece of shit.

1:16:57.614 --> 1:17:00.715
(light opera music)

1:17:15.231 --> 1:17:16.163
- I don't know.

1:17:16.165 --> 1:17:17.198
Why is he being arrested?

1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:19.900
(gunshot)
- I don't know.

1:17:21.070 --> 1:17:23.971
Oh my god!
(woman gasps)

1:17:24.974 --> 1:17:25.973
- Is he okay?

1:17:25.975 --> 1:17:27.008
- [Agent] No, he's done.

1:17:27.010 --> 1:17:28.442
He's done.

1:17:28.444 --> 1:17:30.544
- So, what now?

1:17:30.546 --> 1:17:33.714
- With my brother's
empire finally impotent,

1:17:33.716 --> 1:17:37.184
only impediment in
our way is Rami.

1:17:37.186 --> 1:17:40.354
(upbeat rock music)
