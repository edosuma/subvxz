00:32.500 --> 00:35.709
[quietly] Justin,
I found your bag.

00:35.709 --> 00:38.501
Mind if I tear through it and
look at all your personal stuff?

00:38.999 --> 00:40.167
[loudly] OK, thanks!

00:43.999 --> 00:45.501
No way!

00:45.999 --> 00:47.999
[yelling]

00:49.999 --> 00:52.501
- Ju... Justin!
- [bag growling]

00:52.999 --> 00:54.334
[grunts]

00:56.999 --> 00:59.999
- [bag whooshing]
- [yelling]

01:02.999 --> 01:05.709
What is going on?
Is everyone all right?

01:05.709 --> 01:07.999
- Alex?
- [Alex exclaiming]

01:11.999 --> 01:14.167
Awesome! Dad, whatever
it is can I keep it?

01:14.167 --> 01:16.999
I knew it! Alex was
going through my bag,

01:16.999 --> 01:18.999
so I put a spell on it.
Deny it now.

01:18.999 --> 01:21.999
Of course.
An enchanted messenger bag.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.167
How did we ever manage
without one? Hmm.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.999
But we're going
to have a great...

01:26.999 --> 01:28.167
- Do it.
- Let's watch her run around.

01:28.999 --> 01:30.999
[grumbling]

01:30.999 --> 01:32.999
Magic was used
to protect the bag.

01:32.999 --> 01:34.999
Reverse the spell,
release the hag.

01:36.167 --> 01:39.709
OK, fine. I went through
your stupid bag.

01:39.709 --> 01:40.999
- "Hag?"
- Hmm.

01:40.999 --> 01:42.999
But look at what I found.

01:44.334 --> 01:47.501
The family wand and
the book of forbidden spells.

01:47.501 --> 01:49.999
Justin took it out of the lair
without permission.

01:49.999 --> 01:51.999
My respect for you
is increasing.

01:51.999 --> 01:52.999
I didn't take it.
Dad gave it to me.

01:52.999 --> 01:54.999
And it's shrinking again.

01:54.999 --> 01:57.999
Dad, how could you give this
to Justin? It's forbidden.

01:57.999 --> 01:59.999
You said that we weren't
allowed to touch it.

01:59.999 --> 02:00.999
You said that we weren't ready.

02:00.999 --> 02:02.999
I think by "we"
he meant you.

02:02.999 --> 02:07.999
Alex, if one day, possibly,
you pass and/or show up

02:07.999 --> 02:11.999
to an exam, you can use
the spell book and
the family wand, too.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.999
It's just they're
extremely powerful

02:13.999 --> 02:16.999
and it takes a certain
level of responsibility...

02:16.999 --> 02:19.709
But I'm responsible enough.
I can be trusted.

02:19.709 --> 02:21.999
I think this is completely
unfair to me and Max.

02:21.999 --> 02:22.999
Right, Max?

02:22.999 --> 02:25.999
Dude. Max!

02:28.876 --> 02:30.999
Dude, you are so
not helping right now.

02:30.999 --> 02:32.999
And I'm so getting one of those!

02:32.999 --> 02:34.999
Well, I don't really have
an opinion

02:34.999 --> 02:36.999
about the great wand
whoop-de-do.

02:36.999 --> 02:40.999
But if anybody should be playing
nice right now, it's you.

02:40.999 --> 02:43.999
- Don't push.
We need to go, honey.
- Yes, dear.

02:43.999 --> 02:46.999
I'm going to need you to return
the wand and spell book

02:46.999 --> 02:48.999
back to where you found them.
Thank you.

02:48.999 --> 02:51.876
Fine. I don't even
want it anyway.

02:53.999 --> 02:54.999
Total lie.

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
Wait. Where's
everybody going?

02:56.999 --> 02:59.334
Oh. I want you guys done packing
by the time we get back.

02:59.334 --> 03:02.999
OK. Dude, this is going to be
the best vacation ever.

03:02.999 --> 03:03.999
Are there going
to be volcanoes?

03:03.999 --> 03:06.876
- No.
- Then how great can it be?

03:06.876 --> 03:09.999
- Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Russo.
- Oh hey, Harper. That's...

03:09.999 --> 03:11.167
Hey, wha... what's
Harper doing here?

03:11.167 --> 03:14.334
Oh, uh, right. Listen,
I was thinking since

03:14.334 --> 03:17.999
- you're packing for a trip
I don't have to go on, I...
- What did I just say to you?

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
Uh, when? All the way
back there?

03:19.999 --> 03:23.999
Don't push. I already told you,
you can't go to that party.

03:23.999 --> 03:26.999
It's all the way in Brooklyn.
I don't know the girl's parents.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.999
But Mom, everybody is
going to this party.

03:28.999 --> 03:31.999
That's true. They've handed out
like a thousand fliers.

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
Why are you
destroying my life?

03:33.999 --> 03:35.999
Which is the same thing
you said to me

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
when I tried to "force" you
to go on vacation with us.

03:37.999 --> 03:40.999
Well, it worked then.

03:42.999 --> 03:45.999
Alex, honey...

03:45.999 --> 03:48.876
I know that you're growing up
and you want some independence

03:48.876 --> 03:49.999
and I know that
you're gonna be fine

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
at Harper's
while we're gone.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
But you have to understand
that leaving you behind

03:53.999 --> 03:55.999
is very hard for me.

03:56.999 --> 03:59.334
So just go easy
on me, OK?

03:59.334 --> 04:01.999
Dad. Please. I'll just pop in.
It'll be so...

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
- Uh, no popping.
- [Theresa scoffing]

04:03.999 --> 04:04.999
You heard what
your mother said.

04:04.999 --> 04:06.999
[groaning]

04:06.999 --> 04:08.999
And just so we're clear...

04:08.999 --> 04:12.999
no walking, flying,
teleporting or popping

04:12.999 --> 04:14.999
out of this building
while we're gone.

04:14.999 --> 04:17.999
- Is that understood?
- Understood.

04:18.999 --> 04:19.999
OK.

04:20.999 --> 04:21.999
[sighing]

04:22.999 --> 04:24.999
Sorry about that.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.334
That's OK. We can
still find something

04:26.334 --> 04:28.999
super fun yet
age-appropriate to do.

04:28.999 --> 04:29.999
Oh no, we're still going.

04:29.999 --> 04:32.999
But your parents said
we can't leave the building.

04:34.876 --> 04:35.999
Exactly.

04:35.999 --> 04:37.501
[horn blowing]

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
For the record,
I just want to say

04:42.999 --> 04:45.167
I think this is a
really, really bad idea.

04:45.167 --> 04:49.999
Only if by bad you mean genius.
I love loopholes.

04:49.999 --> 04:50.999
- [horn blasting]
- Alex!

04:57.999 --> 04:59.999
Can we slow this thing down?

04:59.999 --> 05:02.501
Yeah, no. When they put
the tables in

05:02.501 --> 05:03.999
they must have taken
the controls out.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.999
But don't worry, it's enchanted
and knows where it's going.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
Then why are we
heading uptown?

05:08.999 --> 05:09.999
Forty-second.

05:09.999 --> 05:12.999
Forty-ninth.
Fifty-seventh.

05:12.999 --> 05:13.999
Brooklyn's in
the other direction

05:13.999 --> 05:15.999
on the other side
of the river.

05:15.999 --> 05:16.999
Stupid spells.
Hang on.

05:16.999 --> 05:21.999
Oh, wait. My bad.
I had the map upside down.

05:21.999 --> 05:22.999
[chuckling] All right.

05:24.999 --> 05:27.999
Misguided directions
we shouldn't have taken.

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
Hurry up and get us
to Bergen Street Station.

05:29.999 --> 05:32.999
These forbidden spells
are so super user-friendly.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.876
- [brakes screeching]
- [both] Oh!

05:41.999 --> 05:42.999
[both grunting]

05:46.334 --> 05:47.999
Forbidden spells?

05:47.999 --> 05:49.999
Why would you use something
called a forbidden spell?

05:49.999 --> 05:50.999
It's forbidden
and I know this

05:50.999 --> 05:52.999
because it's right there
in the title.

05:52.999 --> 05:55.999
It's really not a big deal
when you have the right wand.

05:55.999 --> 05:56.999
Well, do you?

05:56.999 --> 06:02.999
No. Apparently it's too powerful
and I'm not responsible enough

06:02.999 --> 06:04.999
and I can't be trusted,
whatever that means.

06:04.999 --> 06:07.334
- [horn blaring]
- [screaming]

06:08.999 --> 06:10.000
You go first!
You go first!

06:10.000 --> 06:12.501
Alex!
Oh, my God!

06:13.999 --> 06:15.999
- No! What are you...
- Harper!

06:21.501 --> 06:23.999
[both screaming]

06:26.999 --> 06:30.501
Seriously! Who designed
this subway?

06:30.501 --> 06:32.999
- [bell clanging]
- [both screaming]

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
[horn honking]

06:44.999 --> 06:46.999
I did it.

06:46.999 --> 06:49.999
I can't believe I did it.
I saved us.

06:50.999 --> 06:51.999
I can't believe it.

06:51.999 --> 06:54.999
No you didn't. I did.

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
Oh, Justin, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

06:57.167 --> 06:58.999
Harper, don't thank him.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.999
He just did it so he can
run off and tell on me.

07:00.999 --> 07:02.999
OK, normally, yeah,
I would do that.

07:02.999 --> 07:05.999
- It's pretty funny
when she gets all...
- [giggling]

07:05.999 --> 07:07.709
But I'm not about to
go tell Mom and Dad

07:07.709 --> 07:10.334
something that's going
to ruin their vacation
before it happens.

07:10.334 --> 07:12.999
I'm not gonna let you destroy
something important to me.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
They're not gonna
hear it from me.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.334
Know why they're not
going to hear it from me?

07:16.334 --> 07:17.999
Didn't we just have
this conversation?

07:17.999 --> 07:21.999
Because I just did my first
spell using a full-powered
wizard wand.

07:21.999 --> 07:22.999
- And if I must say...
- He must.

07:22.999 --> 07:26.876
...It went perfectly. Oh.

07:28.999 --> 07:29.999
[metal creaking]

07:39.999 --> 07:41.999
Almost perfectly.

07:41.999 --> 07:42.999
[both gasping]

07:45.334 --> 07:47.999
[crashing]

07:47.999 --> 07:51.999
OK. Well... Bye.

08:03.999 --> 08:06.999
I'm really sorry you can't
stay with me anymore.

08:06.999 --> 08:09.999
Oh! No. I was never really going
to get to stay with you.

08:09.999 --> 08:11.999
She's just been
planning this all along.

08:11.999 --> 08:16.167
And she's just using my
innocent borrowing
of the diner as an excuse.

08:16.167 --> 08:18.709
You know that's not true.
You love your mom.

08:18.709 --> 08:20.999
I didn't say that I didn't.
I just...

08:20.999 --> 08:23.167
I just don't want to spend

08:23.167 --> 08:26.999
two weeks in full-on
family mode.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
Are you guys going to wear
matching outfits?

08:29.999 --> 08:31.501
'Cause that would be bad.

08:33.999 --> 08:37.708
One of these days I'm going
to win the wizard competition

08:37.708 --> 08:39.999
and I'm going to be
the full wizard.

08:39.999 --> 08:40.999
Well, what if you
fall in love with a mortal

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
and have to give up your
powers like your dad did?

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
[scoffs] I still
can't believe he did that.

08:44.999 --> 08:48.999
I can. I love that story.
It sounds so romantic.

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
[Theresa] It was.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.167
Do you need any help?

08:54.167 --> 08:57.999
No. I most definitely
do not need your help.

09:00.167 --> 09:02.999
Well... Bye.

09:04.999 --> 09:07.709
Fine. But one of these days

09:07.709 --> 09:08.999
I just might not be there
to offer it.

09:10.999 --> 09:11.999
Mom.

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

09:16.999 --> 09:20.999
I know what you meant.
Finish packing.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.999
Done.

09:31.167 --> 09:33.999
Undone. See what I
just did there?

09:33.999 --> 09:35.999
It's called lightening
the mood.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.000
I hope you got it
out of your system

09:37.000 --> 09:40.999
because I've declared
this vacation magic-free.

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
Hand it over.

09:42.999 --> 09:43.999
[Jerry] So I'm going
to need your wands.

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
[Max] What? I can't
give up my wand.

09:45.999 --> 09:48.999
Dad, there are so many spells
I haven't even gotten
a chance to do yet.

09:48.999 --> 09:50.999
Max.

09:51.876 --> 09:53.999
[bleating]

09:54.999 --> 09:56.999
Goats?

09:56.999 --> 09:58.999
They were supposed to be tigers.

10:03.999 --> 10:07.501
OK, if I give you my wand, I'll
only be able to do hand magic.

10:07.501 --> 10:08.999
The idea is no magic.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.876
I can't just not
do magic for two weeks.

10:10.876 --> 10:11.999
We're going to the Caribbean.

10:11.999 --> 10:14.999
That's one of the most magical
places in the entire universe.

10:14.999 --> 10:16.501
This is because of Alex,
isn't it?

10:16.501 --> 10:18.999
Justin. It's not
always because of...

10:18.999 --> 10:21.999
Well, OK, yes.
Just give me the wand.

10:21.999 --> 10:24.999
- Come on.
- Come on.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.999
- Give me the wand.
- Give me the wand.

10:28.501 --> 10:30.999
All right.
[sighing]

10:35.999 --> 10:38.999
"Sticky note to self: Do not
forget sticky notes." Ah!

10:38.999 --> 10:42.000
OK, it's time, people!
Everybody ready?

10:43.999 --> 10:44.999
Ready!

10:53.999 --> 10:55.999
Eh, who needs underwear?

10:57.999 --> 10:58.999
Ready!

11:02.999 --> 11:03.999
Ready!

11:03.999 --> 11:06.999
Ready? Smile!

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999
Tell me this is not the cutest
thing you've ever seen.

11:10.999 --> 11:12.999
[chuckling] Yeah... Sorry.

11:12.999 --> 11:16.999
A real family vacation.
This is going to be so much fun!

11:16.999 --> 11:18.999
You guys are going to love this
resort. It has everything.

11:18.999 --> 11:20.999
Oh yes, it's beautiful.

11:20.999 --> 11:22.999
You know it's where your father
and I first met each other.

11:22.999 --> 11:24.999
She's going to tell it.

11:24.999 --> 11:26.876
Oh, please don't tell it.

11:26.876 --> 11:28.999
- Did I ever tell you the story?
- And she's telling it.

11:28.999 --> 11:31.999
It was the summer after
I'd graduated from college...

11:31.999 --> 11:33.999
I was lying
by the pool, right?

11:33.999 --> 11:36.999
And I'd just ordered
this papaya smoothie.

11:36.999 --> 11:39.999
[all] It was a guava smoothie.

11:39.999 --> 11:40.999
Actually, it was
a guava smoothie.

11:40.999 --> 11:43.999
No, no, no, no. Why would I
order a guava smoothie?

11:43.999 --> 11:44.999
I don't even like guavas.

11:46.999 --> 11:51.999
[Theresa laughing] So somehow
I spilled papaya all over your
father's shirt.

11:51.999 --> 11:53.501
[all] Guava.

11:55.334 --> 11:59.999
[Theresa] Oh, but then I looked
up into his eyes and I knew.

11:59.999 --> 12:03.999
<i>Híjole, </i> this is the man for me.

12:03.999 --> 12:06.999
- It was love at first sight.
- Oh.

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
- [all groaning]
- No visuals, please.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.999
- [giggling]
- [Alex groaning]

12:11.999 --> 12:12.999
Or audio.

12:15.999 --> 12:17.999
We're here!

12:19.999 --> 12:23.999
[gasping] I have never been
more happy to be somewhere

12:23.999 --> 12:25.999
I didn't want to be
in my entire life.

12:25.999 --> 12:28.167
<i>Hola. </i> Welcome to paradise.

12:28.167 --> 12:30.999
And the happiness continues.

12:30.999 --> 12:31.999
[Max] Sweet!

12:31.999 --> 12:33.999
Uh-uh, put that back.

12:33.999 --> 12:35.999
Are those included
in the price?

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
Yes. Of course.

12:38.999 --> 12:42.999
Welcome to the Caribbean.
Everybody take two.

12:42.999 --> 12:43.999
- <i>Gracias.
</i>- Enjoy.

12:43.999 --> 12:44.999
I'll just take the whole tray.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.999
Well, I'm Javier. I'm one of
the activities counselors here.

12:49.999 --> 12:52.709
Well, that's great because
I already know

12:52.709 --> 12:53.999
the first thing
I'd like you to do.

12:53.999 --> 12:56.876
- Would you take our picture?
- Yeah. Of course.

12:57.999 --> 12:58.999
Smile.

12:59.999 --> 13:01.709
Say, "paradise."

13:01.709 --> 13:03.999
- [all] Paradise.
- Not likely.

13:05.709 --> 13:08.876
Oh Jerry, look,
it's that little gift shop

13:08.876 --> 13:10.999
where we bought those
coconut monkeys! Remember?

13:10.999 --> 13:13.999
- [squeals] Let's take
a picture of it.
- I love those monkeys.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.334
Great outfits.

13:25.876 --> 13:28.999
What is going on?
Where's everybody going?

13:28.999 --> 13:32.999
I'm going snorkeling.
Once you get used to swimming
in a fish's toilet bowl,

13:32.999 --> 13:34.999
- it's awesome.
- To see the ruins.

13:34.999 --> 13:37.999
The most important battles
of the Troll wars
were fought there.

13:37.999 --> 13:39.999
I don't know, but I'm
getting out of here.

13:39.999 --> 13:42.999
No. No. No. This is
a family vacation.

13:42.999 --> 13:45.999
Your mother's right. We should
be doing everything together.

13:45.999 --> 13:49.999
With you? In public?
Looking like that?

13:49.999 --> 13:50.999
So we're all
in agreement.

Oh, Alex, honey, don't you
just love the ancient walls

15:22.999 --> 15:24.999
and the cobblestone streets?

15:24.999 --> 15:27.999
You know your dad and I
walked these very streets

15:27.999 --> 15:29.999
on one of our
very first dates?

15:29.999 --> 15:31.999
Hmm. It must have been pretty
when it was new.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.999
Hey. This attitude of yours,
that's what's getting old.

15:37.999 --> 15:41.709
I'm sorry, but it's just
memory lane is turning out to be

15:41.709 --> 15:42.999
the longest road ever.

15:42.999 --> 15:44.999
When are we going to do
something I want to do?

15:45.999 --> 15:48.999
You're right.
You're right.

15:48.999 --> 15:50.999
We haven't got to do
something you want to do.

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
You get to choose next,
all right?

15:52.999 --> 15:55.999
Did I mention Javier
teaches windsurfing?

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
Theresa, look.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.167
Oh! My favorite earrings.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.167
Oh dude, check it out.

16:01.167 --> 16:05.501
Top 100 must-see wizard
sightings on the island.

16:05.501 --> 16:08.999
I wonder why we haven't been
to any yet? Oh, wait. I know.

16:08.999 --> 16:09.999
[man] Ladies and gentlemen...

16:10.999 --> 16:13.999
...for just one moment
prepare...

16:13.999 --> 16:16.876
Fine. You want magic?
There's your magic.

16:16.876 --> 16:20.999
And now the beautiful Gisele
will find your card, sir.

16:20.999 --> 16:23.334
Your card. Here we go.
Are you ready? Yes, you will.

16:23.334 --> 16:25.999
Remember what it is?
OK, there you go. Just...

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
Not that one. Which one do you
think it is? Not that one.

16:27.999 --> 16:29.999
No, wrong one.
Go ahead. Try again.

16:29.999 --> 16:30.999
[whispering] Eight of clubs.

16:30.999 --> 16:33.999
The one I'm shoving
in your mouth.
Like we rehearsed.

16:33.999 --> 16:36.999
There it is! The eight...
Oh. She dropped it. Hang on.

16:36.999 --> 16:39.000
Eight of clubs! Amazing!
What do you say?

16:39.000 --> 16:42.999
- [slight applause]
- Pretty amazing
is what I say.

16:42.999 --> 16:44.999
Pretty pathetic
is what I say.

16:44.999 --> 16:46.709
Anybody? Anybody?

16:47.999 --> 16:49.501
You know what the problem is
with you two?

16:51.876 --> 16:53.999
You don't know how
to make your own fun.

16:59.999 --> 17:02.334
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to volunteer.

17:02.334 --> 17:06.999
OK. I wasn't really aware
I was asking for volunteers.

17:06.999 --> 17:08.999
[chuckling] Right.
Got any money?

17:09.999 --> 17:10.999
Yes.

17:14.999 --> 17:16.999
Hope that didn't break you.

17:18.501 --> 17:20.999
Right. First of all,
I will need your drink.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.999
- Why?
- Because I'm doing eight shows
a day in the blazing sun.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.166
Here. Try and blow this up.

17:29.999 --> 17:30.999
Strong lungs?

17:32.167 --> 17:33.999
[cawing]

17:33.999 --> 17:35.999
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

17:35.999 --> 17:39.334
the incredible needle
through balloon.

17:39.334 --> 17:42.999
The needle through...

17:42.999 --> 17:44.167
Oh, yeah.
By the way,

17:44.167 --> 17:46.999
if you happen to see
<i>la policía </i> anywhere,

17:46.999 --> 17:47.999
don't keep it
to yourselves, OK?

17:47.999 --> 17:50.999
'Cause we're having issues.
Thanks.

17:50.999 --> 17:53.000
Needle through the balloon.

17:58.501 --> 17:59.999
OK, that was weird.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.876
[Max] Whoa, watch out.
[chuckles]

18:10.999 --> 18:11.999
[yelling]

18:11.999 --> 18:13.999
[crowd murmuring]

18:18.501 --> 18:20.999
[hollering]

18:22.999 --> 18:23.999
Max.

18:25.999 --> 18:27.999
Oh, yeah. Now that's
a great trick.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.876
Whoa! Oh! Thank you.

18:37.876 --> 18:41.999
That was good, right?
I totally meant for that
to happen.

18:41.999 --> 18:43.999
- Nicely done.
- [man] Thank you!

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
That's got to be
worth something. Oh, thank you.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.000
Thank you. Anything else?
Oh, brilliant. You're awesome.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.334
Hey! Hey! Kiddo!
Hey, hold on!

18:51.334 --> 18:52.999
I want to talk to you.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.999
Just hold on a second!
Hold...

18:56.167 --> 18:58.709
- [parrot squawking]
- [murmurs]

18:58.709 --> 19:02.334
Yeah, all right. I'm going.
Hello, Bert. How's the missus?

19:02.334 --> 19:05.334
Excuse me. Nice truncheon.
Hey! Come back!

19:08.999 --> 19:10.876
[Jerry] What were you thinking?

19:10.876 --> 19:12.999
Is it my fault that
the guy's a great magician?

19:13.999 --> 19:17.709
All right. Look, I'm sorry,
but it was just training magic.

19:17.709 --> 19:20.999
It's no big deal.
I promise you nobody's going to
figure out that we're wizards.

19:20.999 --> 19:22.999
[man] You're wizards!

19:23.999 --> 19:25.876
Maybe just one person.

19:25.876 --> 19:28.999
What? No. Uh...
[chortles]

19:28.999 --> 19:30.999
That's funny. But we are
most definitely not...

19:30.999 --> 19:32.999
Don't...
Don't even try it.

19:32.999 --> 19:33.999
You think if I could
actually do that trick,

19:33.999 --> 19:36.999
- I'd be hustling tourists
for loose change?
- [parrot squawking]

19:36.999 --> 19:40.167
[laughs] Hidden talents.
Come on, kids, let's go.

19:40.167 --> 19:43.999
What? No, no, wait, wait! I
forgot the most important part.

19:43.999 --> 19:45.000
We're wizards, too.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.999
You're wizards?
Uh, I don't think so.

19:47.999 --> 19:50.999
Well, not now. I mean,
obviously. [chuckling]

19:50.999 --> 19:52.709
Yeah, but we were.
I swear. Wizard's honor.

19:54.999 --> 19:57.999
I was born a wizard,
but I lost out at the
family wizard competition

19:57.999 --> 19:59.167
to my know-it-all
older brother.

19:59.167 --> 20:02.709
- [both] I know the feeling.
- The poor lovely Gisele, here,

20:02.709 --> 20:05.999
was transformed into her current
feathery state by an evil... Ow.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
Not telling that part
of the story.

20:09.999 --> 20:12.167
Well, uh, it was nice
running into you

20:12.167 --> 20:15.999
and good luck with
the whole magic thing.

20:15.999 --> 20:17.876
"Pick a card." [chuckling]
It's great.

20:17.876 --> 20:18.999
Everybody into the van.

20:21.999 --> 20:25.999
Wait! I could, uh,
I could show you some
of the wizarding sights.

20:25.999 --> 20:29.999
I am also an excellent,
reasonably-priced tour guide.

20:29.999 --> 20:31.999
Tips are greatly encouraged.

20:31.999 --> 20:33.999
That actually sounds cool.
I was just talking...

20:33.999 --> 20:35.999
Oh, no. It's Alex's
turn to choose.

20:35.999 --> 20:38.999
And I just know she's gonna
pick something really
far away from here.

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
Come on. When did we decide
it was Alex's...

20:40.999 --> 20:43.999
What if my choice is to watch
Justin's lip quiver and beg?

20:43.999 --> 20:45.999
- [laughing]
- Oh.

20:45.999 --> 20:47.709
[Theresa] Come on,
honey. Sorry.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.501
I could show you
<i>La Piedra de los Sueños.</i>

20:55.167 --> 20:56.999
The Stone of Dreams?

20:57.999 --> 21:00.000
I know where it is.
We have a map.

21:01.999 --> 21:05.167
That's, like, the most
important wizard artifact ever.
It can do anything.

21:05.167 --> 21:06.167
Yeah.

21:07.501 --> 21:09.999
- You know where it is?
- Yes.

21:09.999 --> 21:13.999
Dad. He's got a map
to the Stone of Dreams.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.334
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:16.334 --> 21:18.876
So does every other
wizard gift shop in town.

21:18.876 --> 21:21.999
And every year two or
three idiot wizards

21:21.999 --> 21:25.876
go la-di-da-ing through the
forest trying to find the stone.

21:25.876 --> 21:26.999
And they usually end up dead.

21:26.999 --> 21:29.999
Please.
OK, we're desperate.

21:29.999 --> 21:32.999
We've been on this island
for years hoping to find
a wizard who could help us.

21:32.999 --> 21:36.999
The stone is our only hope of
restoring Gisele back to her
former, beautiful self.

21:36.999 --> 21:40.501
Not that you're not beautiful
right now. You're beautiful.
You're gorgeous...

21:40.501 --> 21:41.999
...In this light.

21:41.999 --> 21:44.999
I'm sorry. It's just...

21:44.999 --> 21:47.334
...too dangerous.
Come on, Justin.

21:48.999 --> 21:49.999
Let's go. You're
in the middle seat.

21:51.999 --> 21:54.999
- [Gisele clucks]
- Yeah, I know. But what
other choice did I have?

21:54.999 --> 21:58.876
I mean, if they... Right.
But I know... I have a...

21:58.876 --> 22:00.999
If you'd just listen...
I know what I'm doing.

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
[clucking]

22:02.999 --> 22:06.167
Yes, there's a first time
for everything. Very funny.

22:06.167 --> 22:07.709
[squawks]

22:08.999 --> 22:11.999
Whoa! Are you OK?

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
Are you OK? Don't worry,
you'll be fine.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
Though you might need
a few more lessons.

22:15.999 --> 22:17.999
[chuckles]
Not at these prices.

22:17.999 --> 22:20.709
[Javier] I wasn't good
my first time either, so...

22:20.709 --> 22:23.999
I'm just having a little problem
with the wind part.

22:23.999 --> 22:25.999
- And the surfing part.
- Oh.

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
And the standing up part.

22:27.999 --> 22:31.999
[Justin] Hey Alex!
Watch and learn!

22:31.999 --> 22:33.999
Just like always.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.000
Way to go, Justin!
Great job!

22:35.000 --> 22:38.999
Forbidden-smidden.

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
Though a surfboard
I might be a mess on,

22:40.999 --> 22:43.999
my brother is in need
of a lesson.

22:49.999 --> 22:50.999
Whoa... [whimpering]

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
How do you slow down
on this thing?

22:53.999 --> 22:57.709
Go back! [yelling]

22:57.709 --> 22:58.999
Big wave!
How do I stop?

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
[shrieking]

23:06.501 --> 23:07.999
He's got the wand.

23:08.999 --> 23:11.999
Wow! Nice one, Justin!

23:13.999 --> 23:15.167
That's awesome!
He's a natural!

23:15.167 --> 23:16.999
Yeah, natural idiot.

23:17.999 --> 23:20.999
Whoa...

23:22.999 --> 23:24.999
Go back! Go back!

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
Turn to the wind to slow down.

23:26.999 --> 23:29.999
Which way is the wind?
I can't see!

23:29.999 --> 23:32.999
Watch it. OK, watch it.
Watch out!

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
Watch it! Watch out!

23:36.999 --> 23:38.000
[both grunting]

23:38.000 --> 23:40.334
- Oh!
- Ooh!

23:41.999 --> 23:44.999
Well, every castle
needs a princess, huh?

23:44.999 --> 23:47.999
[chuckles] No? OK.

23:49.999 --> 23:51.999
[laughing] I shouldn't
have laughed,

23:51.999 --> 23:54.000
but you know,
she was OK, right?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.999
Yeah, but poor Alex.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.501
Glad you guys are having
such a good time.

23:58.501 --> 23:59.999
[Javier] Alex.

24:04.999 --> 24:06.999
There's a party
down at the beach later.

24:06.999 --> 24:09.999
Any chance I could talk you
into going with me?

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
A huge chance.

24:11.999 --> 24:14.709
Unfortunately, my mother
isn't so easily persuaded.

24:14.709 --> 24:16.000
But I'll work
something out.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.999
Cool.
I'll see you then.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.999
What are you working out?

24:19.999 --> 24:24.876
Um, how sweet I have to be
for you to let me go
to this party tonight.

24:24.876 --> 24:26.999
With him? [chuckles]
It's so not happening.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.999
Why can't I go?

24:29.999 --> 24:33.999
Alex. First of all, we...
all of us, together...

24:33.999 --> 24:35.999
We're on vacation,
honey.

24:35.999 --> 24:38.876
More like a never-ending
photo shoot.

24:38.876 --> 24:40.999
I am trying
to create memories.

24:40.999 --> 24:42.167
And second, I said no.

24:42.167 --> 24:44.999
You don't need to be spending
any more time with that boy.

24:44.999 --> 24:46.999
But you don't
even know him.

24:46.999 --> 24:48.999
I know that he's
too old for you.

24:48.999 --> 24:52.999
That he probably hits on
every girl that comes
to this resort.

24:52.999 --> 24:56.999
And, at best, he's just
trying to hustle you into
taking more windsurfing lessons.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.999
A party I must attend,
on that we can't agree.

25:03.999 --> 25:06.999
But for a refreshing change,
today you'll side with me.

25:07.999 --> 25:11.167
You know what?
You're young. Go!

25:11.167 --> 25:12.999
Have a good time.

25:15.999 --> 25:17.999
What am I saying?
Absolutely not.

25:18.999 --> 25:20.999
Come on,
everybody's waiting.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.876
Dang it.
Not enough juice.

25:27.999 --> 25:31.999
We were sitting right here
when I told your mother
I was a wizard.

25:31.999 --> 25:35.999
Yes. And he also told me
that he loved me.

25:35.999 --> 25:37.999
Dad, why would you
do something like that?

25:37.999 --> 25:40.501
Didn't you know you were
going to have to give up
your magic?

25:40.501 --> 25:43.709
Well, I knew it was
an important decision,

25:43.709 --> 25:46.999
but I also knew that we could
make some magic of our own.

25:46.999 --> 25:49.999
Well, that was beautiful.
Really guys. I'm tearing up.

25:49.999 --> 25:52.709
Pork? You Justin?
Good. Let's go.

25:57.999 --> 25:58.999
I know you have the wand.

25:58.999 --> 26:01.999
What? No, no, no.
I don't have the wand.

26:01.999 --> 26:03.999
I don't know why you'd think
I had the wand.

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
I wouldn't take the wand
because that would be...

26:05.999 --> 26:07.999
- You went through
my stuff again.
- Didn't have to.

26:07.999 --> 26:10.709
There's no way you could
stay on that windsurfer.

26:10.709 --> 26:12.999
Well, the wind was blowing
really hard. What was I...

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
[blowing]

26:14.999 --> 26:16.999
You? No, no, no.
That's impossible.

26:16.999 --> 26:19.334
You can't do weather spells
unless you have a wand.

26:19.334 --> 26:20.999
Or you use...

26:22.999 --> 26:23.501
You have the spell book.

26:24.999 --> 26:26.999
You're not even going
to try to deny it?

26:26.999 --> 26:30.999
Why? OK, so here's the fun
blackmailing part.

26:30.999 --> 26:35.709
Let me use the wand or I'll
tell Dad you really did take it
without permission this time.

26:35.709 --> 26:37.999
Fine, then I'll tell Dad
you took the book.

26:37.999 --> 26:38.999
So? I'm not the good one.

26:38.999 --> 26:42.999
Please? I found this amazing
"agreement spell"

26:42.999 --> 26:45.999
that'll make Mom and Dad
agree to anything for six hours.

26:45.999 --> 26:48.709
But I don't have enough power
on my own. I need the wand.

26:48.709 --> 26:51.999
So just tell me.
I already have the power.

26:51.999 --> 26:53.999
Fine. You sneak out of dinner,

26:53.999 --> 26:56.000
do a forbidden spell
and risk eternal grounding.

26:57.999 --> 27:00.999
Right. You do the spell.
I'll go keep Mom and Dad busy.

27:09.999 --> 27:14.501
OK. A party I must attend,
on that we can't agree.

27:14.501 --> 27:16.999
- But for a refreshing change...
- Alex?

27:16.999 --> 27:18.999
Mom? What are you doing here?

27:18.999 --> 27:21.999
The minute Justin tried to
magically glue me to my chair,

27:21.999 --> 27:25.000
I knew something was up.
You will not stop, will you?

27:25.000 --> 27:28.709
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Since you've decided you

27:28.709 --> 27:30.999
wanted to control every
single second of my life.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
Please. Do you think
I'm doing this for me?

27:32.999 --> 27:36.876
- Like you're actually
pleasant to be around?
- I am 16.

27:36.876 --> 27:39.876
You can't keep
telling me what to do.

27:39.876 --> 27:41.999
Watch me. For the rest of
this trip you are

27:41.999 --> 27:43.999
going to be pleasant
and present...

27:43.999 --> 27:44.999
You can't make me.

27:44.999 --> 27:47.709
When we get home,
you are grounded for two months.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.334
That's right. No dating.
No parties. No magic.

27:50.334 --> 27:51.999
- Mom!
- Not another word.

27:51.999 --> 27:54.334
I've had it.
Now put that stuff away.

27:59.999 --> 28:03.999
Ooh, I hate you! I wish you
and Dad had never even met!

28:14.999 --> 28:16.999
Mom?

28:20.999 --> 28:24.999
Yes, yes. OK. Thank you.
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

28:24.999 --> 28:26.999
[phone beeps]

28:26.999 --> 28:27.999
- [clearing throat]
- Oh.

28:27.999 --> 28:31.501
- Is everything OK?
- Yes. You startled me.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.999
I didn't think you'd
get here so quickly.

28:33.999 --> 28:34.999
I was just next door.

28:34.999 --> 28:36.999
Well, like I told the guy
at the front desk,

28:36.999 --> 28:39.999
they accidentally brought
some guy's luggage to my room.

28:39.999 --> 28:41.000
Get rid of it, will you?

28:42.501 --> 28:44.334
You're a little young
to be a concierge.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.999
Concierge?

28:46.999 --> 28:50.999
I bet that means you know
where all the hot spots are,
am I right?

28:50.999 --> 28:53.999
I'll definitely be
calling you later.

28:53.999 --> 28:56.999
And if you see the, uh, maid,
tell her I need more towels.

29:02.999 --> 29:04.999
- [luggage banging wall]
- Oh! [scoffs]

29:07.999 --> 29:09.000
Justin!

29:10.999 --> 29:13.000
- Justin!
- Alex!

29:13.000 --> 29:13.999
Alex, what happened?

29:13.999 --> 29:15.999
Uh, nothing. Why?

29:15.999 --> 29:17.999
Does something seem wrong?
Where's Dad?

29:17.999 --> 29:22.000
I don't know. He left and then
Mom left and no one came back.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.999
Did you do the spell?

29:23.999 --> 29:25.999
I did a spell.

29:25.999 --> 29:28.999
Oh, there's Dad.
Hold on.

29:28.999 --> 29:31.999
Hey, uh, I think I'm going to
skip out on all the family stuff

29:31.999 --> 29:35.999
and, um, just focus
on the wizard ruins. Cool?

29:37.334 --> 29:38.999
Uh, sounds good, dude.

29:38.999 --> 29:41.999
You know, like I always say,
do what you got to do.

29:43.876 --> 29:45.999
Bring it and...
[makes booming noise]

29:45.999 --> 29:46.999
Later.

29:49.999 --> 29:50.999
Did Dad just call me "dude?"

29:54.000 --> 29:55.999
Uh... dibs.

29:55.999 --> 29:58.999
Why are Mom and Dad acting like
they don't know each other?

30:04.334 --> 30:05.999
And why is Dad using magic?

30:05.999 --> 30:07.999
Dad is not supposed
to have magic.

30:14.999 --> 30:16.167
Mmm.

30:16.167 --> 30:19.000
And why is he giving flowers
to other girls?
Alex, what did you do?

30:20.999 --> 30:23.167
See? This is what you get
for letting me use the wand.

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
Are you sure this is
where you left them?

30:28.999 --> 30:32.709
Yes. The world went all...

30:32.709 --> 30:34.999
...and then I threw the wand
and the book right there.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.876
Oh. Hey, guys. Thanks for
ditching me back at the
restaurant.

30:37.876 --> 30:39.999
Alex, do you want to tell our
little brother what you did?

30:39.999 --> 30:42.999
She got in a huge fight
with Mom and Dad and
used the family wand...

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
- That you gave me.
- This is not my fault!

30:44.999 --> 30:47.999
To wish that Mom and Dad had
never met and now they haven't.

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
It's exactly like 20 years ago.

30:49.999 --> 30:51.999
They don't know each other
and they don't know us.

30:51.999 --> 30:54.999
Huh. So we have no parents
anymore? Well, I'm confused.

30:54.999 --> 30:56.709
I mean, is this a good thing
or a bad thing?

30:56.709 --> 30:59.999
- Kid's got a point.
- This is a very,
very bad thing.

30:59.999 --> 31:01.999
And once again proves why
I don't do bad things

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
because whenever I do,
more bad things happen.

31:03.999 --> 31:06.501
So you're admitting that
this is kind of your fault.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.000
I can only think of one place
where they'd be.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
[laughing]

31:17.000 --> 31:18.999
You're cute. You know that?

31:18.999 --> 31:21.999
See? There's the book.

31:21.999 --> 31:24.999
Since he hasn't met Mom,
he hasn't had to give up his
powers yet.

31:24.999 --> 31:26.334
He's still a full wizard.

31:26.334 --> 31:28.999
Well, then, we should get
the book and figure a way

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
to reverse the spell.
If we still want it reversed.

31:30.999 --> 31:32.999
- Yes.
- I'm just checking.

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
You're both making this
way too complicated.

31:34.999 --> 31:37.999
There's Mom, all right?
She'll know who I am.

31:38.999 --> 31:42.501
Mom. Hey.

31:42.501 --> 31:43.999
Uh...

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
What? What?
Don't you recognize me?

31:46.999 --> 31:48.709
Oh. Should I?

31:49.999 --> 31:51.999
Yeah. Yeah, you should.
It's me.

31:51.999 --> 31:54.999
Max. Maximum.
Maximilian?

31:54.999 --> 31:57.999
You know, "The cutest little guy
in the whole world."

31:57.999 --> 32:00.999
[chuckling] Or was that just
a bunch of words to you?

32:00.999 --> 32:04.501
Oh. Gosh, if I had known there'd
be this many kids around,

32:04.501 --> 32:05.999
I'd never would have
booked this place.

32:05.999 --> 32:09.999
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
You really don't recognize me?

32:10.999 --> 32:14.999
No idea. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
- Wait! Mom, no!
- [Theresa yelping]

32:17.999 --> 32:18.999
Max!

32:18.999 --> 32:20.999
Hey, Alex.

32:20.999 --> 32:24.999
Oh, uh, Javier. Look, I'm sorry.
Something popped up. I can't go.

32:24.999 --> 32:28.999
- Hey, no worries.
Some other time, right?
- OK.

32:28.999 --> 32:31.999
But let me know if you
want some more lessons

32:31.999 --> 32:34.999
because if you buy five you get
an amazing discount, all right?

32:34.999 --> 32:36.999
[Theresa] Help me. Ow!

32:36.999 --> 32:39.999
- Let go of me right now!
- Hurt, angry, plotting revenge

32:39.999 --> 32:42.999
and oddly disappointed
I don't have a mother to say,
"I told you so."

32:42.999 --> 32:44.999
- [Theresa] Oh!
- Please!

32:44.999 --> 32:46.167
- Mom, no!
- I'm sorry.

32:46.167 --> 32:48.999
Sorry. He has, um,
abandonment issues.

32:48.999 --> 32:50.999
Let go of me right now.
Mom.

32:50.999 --> 32:51.999
Mom?

32:51.999 --> 32:52.999
Security!

32:57.999 --> 32:59.999
Just a simple
levitation spell.

32:59.999 --> 33:01.999
Please.
It's my specialty.

33:02.999 --> 33:04.709
You have no specialty.

33:06.999 --> 33:08.999
- [exhaling] Ah!
- [cracks]

33:10.999 --> 33:11.999
Here we go.

33:24.999 --> 33:27.999
Nobody touches the book.

33:28.999 --> 33:29.999
[gulps]

33:31.501 --> 33:34.999
[laughing] I totally got you.

33:34.999 --> 33:38.999
You're eyes were like
"Oh... What's he gonna do?"

33:38.999 --> 33:41.999
All right. So, uh,
what do I got here?

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
A couple of young wizards
trying to pull a prank?

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
- Something like that.
- Excellent.

33:45.999 --> 33:48.999
You know what?
I turned my math teacher into
a golden retriever one time...

33:48.999 --> 33:51.999
Never got caught.
Played fetch a lot in the class.

33:51.999 --> 33:52.999
You know, roll things up
and threw it.

33:52.999 --> 33:55.999
- One order of <i>grande </i> nachos.
- Oh.

33:55.999 --> 33:58.999
<i>- Muchas gracias.
- De nada.</i>

34:03.999 --> 34:06.501
The portions here
are really small.

34:06.501 --> 34:07.999
You just did magic for fun.

34:07.999 --> 34:10.998
And for cheese dip.
You guys want something?
You hungry?

34:10.998 --> 34:12.998
It's on me.
It's just money, right?

34:12.998 --> 34:15.000
Where was that attitude
when I wanted my own phone?

34:15.000 --> 34:18.998
I know, right?
Parents can be such jerks.

34:18.998 --> 34:22.333
Hey, for no particular reason,
just making conversation here,

34:22.333 --> 34:25.167
I don't suppose you have
a titanium wand on you?

34:27.998 --> 34:31.876
I so do!
I'm my family's wizard.

34:31.876 --> 34:35.998
I, uh, I've got more power
than you could ever imagine.

34:39.708 --> 34:40.998
Pretty cool, huh?

34:40.998 --> 34:43.998
You know, people say that magic
isn't that important.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.998
But guess what?
They're liars.

34:46.998 --> 34:50.998
It totally is! Here.
Magic is awesome.

34:50.998 --> 34:51.998
Check it out.

34:52.998 --> 34:55.998
[up-tempo music plays]

35:00.999 --> 35:02.999
[people cheering, whistling]

35:06.999 --> 35:08.999
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

35:08.999 --> 35:09.999
The front desk
just called.

35:09.999 --> 35:12.167
They're getting that luggage
out of your room.

35:15.999 --> 35:17.999
Guys, that's our stuff.

35:20.999 --> 35:23.999
- Since you're a full wizard,
can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

35:23.999 --> 35:28.999
Suppose, uh, a young, stupid,
selfish, inexperienced...

35:28.999 --> 35:30.999
He gets it.

35:30.999 --> 35:33.999
...wizard accidentally wished
that her parents never met
before.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.999
What do you do
to fix that?

35:37.999 --> 35:41.000
I have no idea.
I'm glad that wasn't on my exam.

35:42.999 --> 35:44.999
They'd have to
do something pretty fast.

35:44.999 --> 35:47.334
You know, to prevent any
serious, permanent damage.

35:47.334 --> 35:48.999
- Serious?
- Permanent?

35:48.999 --> 35:49.999
- Damage?
- Yeah, you know, uh...

35:49.999 --> 35:52.000
- [rhythm changes]
- Let's say these people
had kids...

35:52.000 --> 35:54.334
Oh! I love this song!

35:54.334 --> 35:55.999
[both groan]

35:56.999 --> 35:59.167
[Jerry] Shake it. Shake.

36:06.501 --> 36:08.999
So eventually reality
would catch up with the kids

36:08.999 --> 36:12.501
and they'd disappear forever.
No meet. No kids.

36:12.501 --> 36:15.334
This is simple magic logic.
Who is your teacher?

36:15.334 --> 36:18.999
- How soon exactly?
- I don't know. Like 48 hours?

36:18.999 --> 36:21.999
Forty-eight hours?
Forty-eight hours?

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
But they'd know
before it was going to happen

36:23.999 --> 36:26.999
because they'd start forgetting
everything about their past.

36:26.999 --> 36:29.501
- Can't remember when I was ten.
- I don't remember
your birthdays.

36:29.501 --> 36:31.999
- Did I have a tenth birthday?
- They'd need a miracle.

36:31.999 --> 36:34.999
All right, well, it was nice
chatting with you guys.

36:34.999 --> 36:37.999
I hear there's a kicking party
down on the beach. Later!

36:37.999 --> 36:41.501
A miracle or
<i>La Piedra de los Sueños.</i>

36:43.999 --> 36:46.999
The Stone of Dreams?
Yeah, that'd do it.

36:46.999 --> 36:50.334
You know, I hear it can grant
any wish or reverse any spell.

36:50.334 --> 36:52.999
Oh man, that'd be fun
trying to find that.

36:52.999 --> 36:54.999
Isn't it dangerous, though?

36:56.709 --> 36:59.999
So? Is he always like this?

36:59.999 --> 37:02.876
Ooh! I almost forgot my nachos.

37:10.999 --> 37:12.999
- [Justin] Alex.
- [moaning]

37:12.999 --> 37:14.999
- [Justin] Alex!
- [yelling]

37:14.999 --> 37:19.999
[coughing] OK, I'm up.
I'm up.

37:19.999 --> 37:22.501
Uh... Mom and Dad are gone.
Uh, what's your plan?

37:22.501 --> 37:24.999
Oh. Oh I get it.

37:24.999 --> 37:27.999
You thought you would just wake
up and problem solved.

37:27.999 --> 37:30.999
- Of course I would
think of something.
- Kind of hoping...

37:30.999 --> 37:34.876
All right, guys. Come on. We're
all going to disappear. Justin?

37:37.999 --> 37:38.999
Of course I thought
of something.

37:38.999 --> 37:42.501
OK, Alex and I are going
to find the Stone of Dreams.

37:42.501 --> 37:44.999
Max, stay and make sure
that Mom and Dad don't get
into trouble.

37:44.999 --> 37:46.999
Trouble? They're old.

37:46.999 --> 37:49.999
What kind of trouble you think
they're going to get into?

37:49.999 --> 37:52.999
Hmm. I don't know.
Meet other people,
fall in love, have kids...

37:52.999 --> 37:55.999
Oh, OK. All right,
I'll keep an eye on them.

37:57.999 --> 38:00.999
Here you go.

38:00.999 --> 38:02.999
I can't believe it.
The map to the Stone of Dreams.

38:02.999 --> 38:05.999
I knew you'd call. That you
wouldn't let us down.

38:05.999 --> 38:09.999
You know, when I told you about
the map, Gisele's feathers were
all in a ruffle, weren't they?

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
- [squawking]
- She never thinks
I know what I'm doing.

38:11.999 --> 38:16.999
This is a flier for an
all-you-can-eat special
at the Crab Shack.

38:16.999 --> 38:19.999
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh,
don't want to lose that.

38:19.999 --> 38:21.999
Best flan on the island.

38:22.999 --> 38:24.999
Ah, here we go.

38:29.999 --> 38:31.999
[Justin] Are you sure
this is the map?

38:31.999 --> 38:34.876
Only one of its kind
in the entire world.

38:34.876 --> 38:36.999
Hey, guys. [laughing]

38:36.999 --> 38:38.709
Look what I just bought.

38:38.709 --> 38:41.501
A map to the Stone of
Dreams. Pretty cool.

38:41.501 --> 38:43.999
You guys totally inspired me.
Fingers-crossed.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.167
I'll let you know
what I find out.

38:46.999 --> 38:47.999
Where's Max?

38:47.999 --> 38:51.167
Jerry, wait up. I swear
they're like cockroaches.

38:51.167 --> 38:54.999
You corner one and the other
one takes off in the opposite
direction.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
- Jerry!
- The only map
in the world, huh?

38:56.999 --> 38:58.167
[squawks]

39:03.999 --> 39:08.999
In my defense, I haven't
showered in, like, two days.

39:08.999 --> 39:11.000
The reason the
other maps don't work...

39:12.999 --> 39:15.999
...is because no one
knows the right place to start.

39:26.999 --> 39:29.999
All right, people, let's move.
There's not a lot of time.

39:32.709 --> 39:34.167
Which way?

39:36.999 --> 39:39.709
There's all this writing,
but it doesn't even make sense.

39:39.709 --> 39:42.999
Because it's in Spanish,
which you've only been taking
since first grade.

39:42.999 --> 39:45.999
Oh. I kind of peaked
at <i>"Habla Inglés?"</i>

39:45.999 --> 39:50.999
- [chirping]
- I know, but our options
were rather limited.

39:50.999 --> 39:54.999
It says that the path will only
reveal itself to those whose
intentions are pure.

39:54.999 --> 39:56.999
So me, obviously.

39:58.501 --> 40:02.999
Normally, I'd object,
but even I can't make
that argument.

40:10.999 --> 40:12.334
[grunting] OK.

40:13.999 --> 40:17.999
Show me the way. Open up.
Reveal the path.

40:21.999 --> 40:23.999
[clearing throat]

40:23.999 --> 40:27.167
Show me the way. Open up.
Reveal the path.

40:30.999 --> 40:35.501
Maybe, um... Maybe I translated
it wrong. Here, hold this.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.999
- [grunting]
- I'll get my
Spanish dictionary.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.999
I did it! That was easy.

40:47.999 --> 40:51.999
It must have been a delayed
reaction from what I...
from what I did.

40:57.999 --> 41:00.334
Yes. Onward. I'm... Hold on.

41:10.999 --> 41:11.999
[Gisele squawks]

41:19.999 --> 41:22.999
[man] Come on, Gisele.
Why do you always have to
bring that up?

41:22.999 --> 41:25.999
- [Gisele squawks]
- Oh. I do apologize.
You're getting wet.

41:25.999 --> 41:27.999
In a rain forest, while we're
trying to save you.

41:27.999 --> 41:29.000
[Gisele chirps]

41:29.000 --> 41:34.999
So, hey. Stone of Dreams.
One wish per wizard.

41:34.999 --> 41:36.999
You guys get to
restore your family,

41:36.999 --> 41:40.709
the beautiful Gisele becomes
herself again, and, uh...

41:40.709 --> 41:44.999
- what do I use it for, though?
That's the question, isn't it?
- [Gisele squawking]

41:44.999 --> 41:46.709
I know nobody asked.
But if they did...

41:46.709 --> 41:47.999
- [chirps]
- I said "if."

41:47.999 --> 41:48.999
You know what?
Forget it.

41:48.999 --> 41:51.999
No, it's going to be a surprise.
I'm not going to say.

41:51.999 --> 41:54.999
No, I'm not pouting.

41:54.999 --> 41:57.999
How did she get turned
into a bird anyway?

41:57.999 --> 42:00.999
Oh, it's... it's really
quite a story.

42:00.999 --> 42:03.999
Ow! Ow! Finger!
Blood! Pain!

42:05.167 --> 42:08.709
[gasping] I don't know really.

42:13.999 --> 42:16.999
Oh! Justin!

42:16.999 --> 42:19.999
Sorry. I'm just trying
to make sure that we're
headed in the right...

42:22.999 --> 42:25.999
Double waterfall! Yes! We're
headed in the right direction.

42:25.999 --> 42:28.999
Perfect. Headed
in the right direction.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
Hey, I've got an idea.

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
Why don't I lead
and you follow?

42:35.999 --> 42:41.501
Um, maybe because you can't read
a map or a compass or Spanish.

42:41.501 --> 42:44.999
Well, I know enough not to walk
into a giant spider web.

42:44.999 --> 42:49.999
- Get it off me!
Get it off! Get it off!
- [laughing]

42:49.999 --> 42:50.999
Oh, that never gets old.

42:50.999 --> 42:52.999
You were screaming like
a little girl.

42:52.999 --> 42:55.999
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

42:56.999 --> 42:58.999
That doesn't count.

42:58.999 --> 43:00.999
I actually am a little girl.

43:00.999 --> 43:03.999
- We'll never speak
of this again. Agreed?
- Agreed.

43:03.999 --> 43:08.999
- [Gisele squawks]
- Yeah, this might actually take
a little longer than I thought.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
But trust me, OK.

43:11.999 --> 43:14.999
Trust me. Don't shake.
You're so negative.

43:14.999 --> 43:16.999
I have a good
feeling about this.

43:16.999 --> 43:19.999
As long as we stick close
and never let them out of
our sight...

43:23.999 --> 43:26.999
Where'd they go? Hello?

43:28.999 --> 43:30.999
Where did all this
rain come from?

43:30.999 --> 43:33.999
Yeah, I know it's a rain forest.
I told you that earlier.

43:33.999 --> 43:34.999
Do you have to parrot
everything I say?

43:34.999 --> 43:36.999
- [Gisele squawking]
- Oh, sorry.

43:38.167 --> 43:41.167
All right, we should be headed
six degrees north by northeast.

43:41.167 --> 43:43.876
We just follow this path
all the way... Stop!

43:44.999 --> 43:47.999
Yeah, about here. Um, OK. Now
we need to change directions.

43:47.999 --> 43:50.709
- I think...
- Justin. We're kind of
in a hurry here.

43:50.709 --> 43:51.999
Time rippling.
Us disappearing.

43:51.999 --> 43:54.999
[scoffs] You can't go two
seconds without criticizing me,
can you?

43:56.999 --> 43:59.000
- What?
- You're right. I can't.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.999
The will to mock
is just too great.

44:00.999 --> 44:02.999
Could we please just
do this my way?

44:02.999 --> 44:04.999
Why do we have to do everything
the way you do magic?

44:04.999 --> 44:06.999
- You mean perfectly?
- I mean annoyingly.

44:06.999 --> 44:10.999
There's a right way to do things
and that's the way I like
to do them.

44:10.999 --> 44:14.999
Another 20 feet in
this direction. You know, you
might want to try it sometime.

44:15.999 --> 44:17.000
Why are you getting taller?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.999
Oh, because you couldn't
stop being perfect long enough

44:19.999 --> 44:22.709
to realize that you're
standing in quicksand.

44:24.167 --> 44:27.999
Alex! Help me! Please!
Help me! Get me out of here!
Help me, please!

44:27.999 --> 44:29.999
Grab onto my hand.
Grab my hand.

44:29.999 --> 44:31.999
- OK.
- Not funny!

44:31.999 --> 44:34.999
Now maybe we can get
someplace, huh? OK.

44:34.999 --> 44:36.999
So we're here and we
need to get there.

44:36.999 --> 44:39.999
- You're holding it upside down!
Grab onto something!
- Oh! [chuckling]

44:39.999 --> 44:42.000
Well, that makes it better.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.999
- Not really.
- I'm sinking!

44:43.999 --> 44:45.999
Needs one of those little "x"
thingies, like at the mall.

44:45.999 --> 44:47.999
Alex, grab onto something!
I'm sinking!

44:47.999 --> 44:49.999
Here we are.
"Bottomless Pit of Death."

44:49.999 --> 44:51.876
We need to go towards
some squiggly things.

44:51.876 --> 44:53.999
They're called mountains!
Alex, seriously. It's...

44:53.999 --> 44:56.999
OK. Sure. Mountains.
[scoffs]

44:56.999 --> 44:57.999
- There's animals in here!
- Oh, wait.

44:57.999 --> 45:00.501
There they are.
That was easy.

45:00.501 --> 45:01.999
OK. Help me out now.
Grab something.

45:01.999 --> 45:04.999
- [sighs] Fine.
- A branch. Part of a tree.

45:04.999 --> 45:07.999
Help me, Alex. Come on. Help me.
You've got it. Please.

45:08.999 --> 45:10.999
Will let me be in control
of the map?

45:10.999 --> 45:13.999
No. Why would I put you in
charge? Just give me the stick!

45:13.999 --> 45:16.167
You know, I hear the more you
struggle the faster you sink.

45:16.167 --> 45:18.334
It's amazing what I retain, huh?

45:18.334 --> 45:21.999
- Fine, fine. Whatever you want.
Just give me the stick.
- Promise?

45:21.999 --> 45:23.999
Yes. No.

45:23.999 --> 45:26.999
Yes, yes, I promise.
OK. Come on. [crying out]

45:26.999 --> 45:30.999
Pull. OK, pull. [gasping]

45:31.999 --> 45:33.999
Oh, thank goodness.
There you are.

45:33.999 --> 45:35.999
Thought I'd lost you.
Did I miss anything?

45:35.999 --> 45:37.876
[gasping] Not a thing.

45:37.876 --> 45:40.999
All right, people!
Let's move. This way.

45:40.999 --> 45:42.999
- The other way.
- The other this way.

45:44.999 --> 45:46.999
[speaking Spanish]

45:46.999 --> 45:48.999
- What does that mean? Coconut?
- No.

45:48.999 --> 45:50.999
[all laughing]

45:50.999 --> 45:51.999
Uh, one guava smoothie,
please.

45:51.999 --> 45:54.999
Uh, we don't make
guava smoothies. Sorry.

45:54.999 --> 45:55.999
Well then, what am I drinking?

45:55.999 --> 45:59.999
- Papaya.
- Papaya. I love
the way you say that.

45:59.999 --> 46:03.999
All these years.
Get your fruits straight, man.

46:03.999 --> 46:05.999
- What?
- What? Nothing.

46:05.999 --> 46:07.999
- Thank you.
- [woman] You're welcome.

46:07.999 --> 46:09.999
<i>Gracias.</i>

46:09.999 --> 46:14.999
Hey, why don't you take this
over to that, um, girl for me?

46:14.999 --> 46:17.999
You know, she was kind of asking
about you earlier.

46:17.999 --> 46:20.999
Who is that?
Is that your mom?

46:20.999 --> 46:24.999
What? What? No! No.

46:24.999 --> 46:29.167
Unless you think she is and
memories are flooding back.

46:29.167 --> 46:31.999
You know, you're a weird
little kid, you know that?

46:31.999 --> 46:35.999
Yeah, I get that a lot.
So... Hmm?

46:37.999 --> 46:40.999
No. I'm good.

46:40.999 --> 46:42.999
Oh. No worries. No worries.

46:42.999 --> 46:46.999
I'm just saying you could do a
lot better. Between you and me?

46:46.999 --> 46:48.999
- She's kind of a dog.
- Oh, come on, buddy.

46:48.999 --> 46:49.999
- What?
- She's...

46:49.999 --> 46:52.709
- Have you looked at her?
- Yes, I have and she's hot.

46:52.709 --> 46:56.999
She's... Oh.
Um, that's not funny.

46:56.999 --> 47:01.999
[laughing] OK, it's a little
funny. You stole that from me.

47:01.999 --> 47:03.167
- [laughing]
- All right. Joke's over.

47:03.167 --> 47:05.999
Turn her back
before somebody sees.

47:05.999 --> 47:07.999
All right. I will.

47:07.999 --> 47:11.999
[imitates foreign accent]
As soon as you take this
over there.

47:11.999 --> 47:15.709
[sighing] Fine. But I don't know
why you want me to...

47:15.709 --> 47:16.999
[both exclaiming]

47:16.999 --> 47:18.709
What is the matter
with you?

47:18.709 --> 47:20.999
I'm so sorry. I actually was
bringing that drink to you.

47:20.999 --> 47:22.709
Why? So you could
throw it on me?

47:22.709 --> 47:24.999
Wait. This is supposed to be
the other way around.

47:25.999 --> 47:27.999
I'm seriously...

47:27.999 --> 47:29.999
- Oh!
- Oh!

47:29.999 --> 47:31.999
I'm so sorry. I don't know
why I just did that.

47:31.999 --> 47:33.999
Oh, you don't know
why you did.

47:33.999 --> 47:35.999
- You just pick it up
and then you...
- No.

47:35.999 --> 47:37.999
You know what?

47:37.999 --> 47:39.999
Um, it's OK.

47:39.999 --> 47:42.167
Let's just call it even.

47:42.167 --> 47:44.999
No, I wasn't trying
to make things even. I...

47:44.999 --> 47:48.876
No. I meant, seriously.
I mean it. It's fine.

47:48.876 --> 47:50.876
- OK.
- It's OK.

47:50.876 --> 47:52.709
[chuckling]

47:53.999 --> 47:54.999
Sorry.

47:56.999 --> 47:59.999
- What are you doing? That's it?
- What's the matter with you?

47:59.999 --> 48:03.999
Oh. You like her, right?
Then why don't you go after her?

48:03.999 --> 48:06.999
Cute and feisty?
Those are the most dangerous.

48:06.999 --> 48:10.999
I could really fall for her.
You know, if she was a wizard.

48:10.999 --> 48:11.999
What does that matter?

48:11.999 --> 48:12.999
I told you.
I'm a full wizard.

48:12.999 --> 48:14.999
I'm not going to give up
my powers for some mortal.

48:14.999 --> 48:17.999
- You don't understand...
- Oh, this is sticky now.

48:17.999 --> 48:19.999
- This is sticky.
- You... [groans]

48:21.999 --> 48:24.999
Why do I feel like there was
something I was supposed to do?

48:29.999 --> 48:31.999
[bugs buzzing]

48:31.999 --> 48:34.999
- Ow.
- You OK?

48:34.999 --> 48:36.999
If Mom was still Mom, this
would've never happened.

48:36.999 --> 48:39.999
She would've told me
to put on bug spray.

48:39.999 --> 48:41.999
So? You wouldn't have
listened to her.

48:41.999 --> 48:44.999
True, but at least she'd be
telling me, "I told you so."

48:44.999 --> 48:48.999
[groaning] I miss her
condescending tone and her
superior attitude.

48:48.999 --> 48:50.999
Remind you of anybody?

48:50.999 --> 48:53.999
Yes. Mom. Aren't you
listening to me?

48:59.999 --> 49:02.999
But I'm sure if we just asked
them not to say anything...

49:02.999 --> 49:04.999
- [squawking]
- Yeah, yeah, but I know.

49:04.999 --> 49:06.999
I know you were sentenced
to 50 years in feathers.

49:06.999 --> 49:11.999
But maybe they couldn't find us
if we moved to some remote
jungle somewhere.

49:11.999 --> 49:13.999
- Just you and me.
- [chirps]

49:13.999 --> 49:16.999
But if we take the stone first
they'll disappear forever.

49:18.999 --> 49:21.709
Which is why
it's the perfect plan.

49:24.167 --> 49:26.876
It really is the perfect plan.

49:27.999 --> 49:29.999
You're kind of good
at this, aren't you?

49:31.999 --> 49:35.999
Right. I hate it
when we fight, too.

49:35.999 --> 49:36.999
[chirps]

50:00.999 --> 50:03.999
How are we going to get across
this thing? There's no way.

50:03.999 --> 50:06.999
It's impossible. We're totally,
completely, hopelessly doomed.

50:06.999 --> 50:08.999
Oh, wait,
there's instructions.

50:08.999 --> 50:11.709
It's that positive attitude
I most admire about you, Justin.

50:11.709 --> 50:14.999
It says we have to build,
uh, uh... a path of stone.

50:14.999 --> 50:15.999
That's not going to happen.

50:15.999 --> 50:18.999
- With magic.
- That might happen.

50:27.999 --> 50:31.999
I may not be a full wizard.
I might not have a family wand.

50:32.999 --> 50:34.999
And you were no help whatsoever.

50:34.999 --> 50:39.876
But you got to admit, this, uh,
this is pretty impressive.

50:39.876 --> 50:42.999
All it takes is a superior
knowledge of hand magic

50:42.999 --> 50:44.999
and two semesters
of Advanced Placement Geometry.

50:45.999 --> 50:48.999
What? No, uh...
[coughing] "Loser?"

50:48.999 --> 50:50.876
No eye-rolling?
"Get a life."

50:50.876 --> 50:52.999
What was that?

50:52.999 --> 50:56.167
"Thank you, Justin. You've
saved us. You're my hero."
Well, you're welcome.

50:56.167 --> 50:57.999
- Good job.
- Righty-o.

50:59.334 --> 51:00.999
What?

51:02.999 --> 51:04.000
What's a pebble
going to do to my...

51:23.999 --> 51:27.999
And may I be the first?
[coughing] Loser.

51:27.999 --> 51:30.999
OK. You know, maybe we're
just going to hang back here
for a few moments

51:30.999 --> 51:32.999
and stay
out of your way.

51:32.999 --> 51:36.000
No reason for all of us to
plummet to our deaths, right?

51:39.999 --> 51:42.709
[wind blowing]

51:43.876 --> 51:45.999
Admit it.
It's not a bad idea.

51:46.999 --> 51:48.999
It's just a simple
levitation spell.

51:48.999 --> 51:51.999
[Justin] Yes, yes.
You're brilliant. Focus.

51:53.999 --> 51:55.999
Don't... Don't look down!

51:57.999 --> 51:59.000
That's a long way down.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.999
Why do you always get so mad
every time I do something right?

52:02.999 --> 52:04.999
Because it's like
you don't even try.

52:04.999 --> 52:05.999
You don't even
think about it.

52:05.999 --> 52:08.999
Not thinking works for me.

52:08.999 --> 52:10.876
Exactly.
And it's not fair.

52:10.876 --> 52:12.999
I know everything
there is to know about magic

52:12.999 --> 52:15.334
and you just come along and...
and you do it.

52:17.709 --> 52:19.167
Which is why I have to
study all the time.

52:19.167 --> 52:23.876
Usually I'm all, "Family wizard.
How could it not be me?"

52:24.999 --> 52:27.999
And then you come along
and do something like this.

52:29.999 --> 52:32.501
Trust me, you're not gonna lose.
You'll be the family wizard.

52:32.501 --> 52:34.167
Do you even want it?

52:34.167 --> 52:35.167
- [gasping]
- Alex!

52:35.167 --> 52:36.999
Ooh!

52:41.501 --> 52:42.999
Oh, that was close.

52:42.999 --> 52:45.501
I don't know.
I don't think I do.

52:45.501 --> 52:49.876
Why? I know why I do. I'd be
nothing if I wasn't a wizard.

52:49.876 --> 52:52.709
Magic is the one thing
that I'm really, really good at.

52:52.709 --> 52:54.999
[scoffs] Please.
You're good at everything.

52:55.999 --> 52:57.999
[exhaling] I hope they make it.

52:58.999 --> 53:02.501
"Justin's so perfect. Why can't
you be more like Justin?"

53:02.501 --> 53:05.999
- Who says that?
- Besides you? Everyone.

53:06.999 --> 53:08.999
Mom and Dad.

53:08.999 --> 53:11.999
Well, they wouldn't say that if
I wasn't so perfect.

53:13.999 --> 53:16.876
You know that's not true.
They love you regardless.

53:18.999 --> 53:20.000
You know that goes
both ways.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
- [gasping]
- Alex!

53:28.501 --> 53:29.999
They're almost there.

53:37.999 --> 53:38.999
Good job.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
We both did a good job.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.999
Hello! Hello! Don't forget
your loyal and trusty guides.

53:47.999 --> 53:49.999
Could you just
send the rocks back?

53:53.167 --> 53:55.709
[boulders clattering]

53:55.709 --> 53:57.999
Uh...

53:57.999 --> 53:59.999
There's not enough time.

53:59.999 --> 54:02.709
We'll come back for you
after we get the stone.

54:02.709 --> 54:03.999
Bye!

54:05.999 --> 54:09.167
[clucking]

54:09.167 --> 54:14.000
Yes, in retrospect, maybe
not taking the lead wasn't
a very good strategy.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.999
- [chirping]
- What?

54:18.999 --> 54:21.999
- Down there?
- [Gisele chirps]

54:21.999 --> 54:24.334
Well, it does seem
to be the only way...

54:24.334 --> 54:27.999
Have I ever mentioned
my fear of heights?

54:27.999 --> 54:30.999
Not caring. OK. Fine.

54:34.999 --> 54:38.876
What? I'm going. I'm going.

54:38.876 --> 54:39.999
Just because you can fly...

54:43.999 --> 54:44.999
[Jerry] Namaste, baby!
Good class.

54:44.999 --> 54:48.501
There you are!
OK, where have you been?

54:48.501 --> 54:49.999
- [woman] See you, Jerry!
- Call me.

54:49.999 --> 54:53.999
Yoga lesson. Which is just fancy
stretching if you ask me.

54:53.999 --> 54:55.334
- But I mean...
- [Max] Oh.

54:55.334 --> 54:56.999
- Look at the...
- [Max] Really?

54:56.999 --> 54:59.999
That's great. It sounds like
you've just got money to burn.

54:59.999 --> 55:01.876
Hey, if you go to
the restaurant tonight,

55:01.876 --> 55:02.999
don't order the noodles.

55:02.999 --> 55:05.999
Because at 9:00...
[chuckling]

55:05.999 --> 55:08.999
...they're going to turn into
worms. People are gonna freak.

55:08.999 --> 55:11.999
- Hmm. Really? Really?
Pasta into worms.
- Yeah.

55:11.999 --> 55:14.999
The dad that I know would
never let me get away
with something like that.

55:14.999 --> 55:19.999
I know. Mine either. Hey, you
from New York? Well, me too.

55:19.999 --> 55:20.999
[woman] Hi, Jerry.

55:20.999 --> 55:22.876
- [Max] Yeah. I guess.
- Hey!

55:22.876 --> 55:24.999
Actually, I'm not sure
where I was born.

55:24.999 --> 55:25.999
[Jerry] Do you remember me?

55:25.999 --> 55:28.876
- You see, I...
- [Jerry] Nice suit.

55:29.999 --> 55:33.000
Oh, Theresa.
Where are you going?

55:33.000 --> 55:35.999
None of your business.

55:35.999 --> 55:38.999
- [sighing] Look, I know
what this is about.
- You do?

55:38.999 --> 55:41.334
Yes. You're trying to set me up
with your friend.

55:41.334 --> 55:42.999
Trust me, he couldn't be
less interested.

55:42.999 --> 55:45.501
What? No.
That's not true at all.

55:45.501 --> 55:48.999
In fact, he told me
that you were his type.

55:48.999 --> 55:49.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:51.167 --> 55:54.000
Well, it doesn't matter,
because I've already made plans.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.999
With who?

55:55.999 --> 55:58.999
Uh...[clearing throat] All set.
The boat is ready for us.

55:58.999 --> 56:00.999
- [Theresa] Thank you.
- [magic zapping]

56:00.999 --> 56:03.999
- Oh, um, that boat?
- [water bubbling]

56:03.999 --> 56:05.876
Yeah...

56:08.709 --> 56:12.999
Would you excuse me for just
one moment? Please?

56:13.999 --> 56:14.999
[groans]

56:17.000 --> 56:18.999
[insects humming]

56:26.876 --> 56:27.999
You warm enough?

56:33.999 --> 56:38.334
Justin, what if we don't
get the stone in time and
we can't save everyone?

56:40.876 --> 56:42.999
Don't worry about it.
We will.

56:42.999 --> 56:44.999
How do you know that?

56:44.999 --> 56:49.000
Because it's you and I.
How can we not?

56:52.999 --> 56:57.334
You know, um, I think this is
the longest you've ever gone...

56:57.334 --> 56:59.999
Wait...

56:59.999 --> 57:03.167
This is the longest you've ever
gone without making fun of me.

57:03.999 --> 57:04.999
[chuckles]

57:04.999 --> 57:07.167
It's true.

57:07.167 --> 57:09.999
I knew there was something
I was supposed to do.

57:09.999 --> 57:11.999
- Mmm.
- Where do you want me to start?

57:11.999 --> 57:15.999
No, no, no. I actually kind of
like this. Let's try this.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.999
"Only those whose
intentions are pure."

57:27.999 --> 57:30.999
How come you could open
the gate today and I couldn't?

57:31.999 --> 57:33.999
I don't know.

57:33.999 --> 57:36.999
All I kept thinking about
was saving our family.

57:36.999 --> 57:38.999
I was thinking
about that, too.

57:38.999 --> 57:41.999
And how great it would be
if I was the one to do it.

57:46.999 --> 57:48.000
There's my answer.

57:52.999 --> 57:54.999
You're a great wizard,
Justin.

57:56.999 --> 57:58.999
I just know
a bunch of spells.

57:59.999 --> 58:00.999
How does that
make me great?

58:00.999 --> 58:03.999
That isn't why
I think you're great.

58:06.999 --> 58:09.999
You're always
there for me.

58:09.999 --> 58:11.999
No matter how many times
I screw up.

58:11.999 --> 58:14.999
That doesn't
make me great.

58:14.999 --> 58:17.000
That just makes me
a good brother.

58:20.501 --> 58:22.999
I know I don't say
it very often...

58:25.999 --> 58:26.999
...but thank you.

58:29.999 --> 58:31.999
You're welcome.

58:45.334 --> 58:46.999
[twig snapping]

58:47.999 --> 58:49.999
[twig snapping]

58:49.999 --> 58:52.999
[whispering] Alex. Alex, get up.
I think someone's out there.

58:52.999 --> 58:54.999
Mmm. You're the boy.
You go check it.

58:54.999 --> 58:56.999
[twig breaking]

58:59.999 --> 59:01.999
[man grunting]

59:03.999 --> 59:06.999
Oh, my gosh. Um, uh... Sorry.

59:06.999 --> 59:08.999
We didn't know who it was and
Justin was just like,

59:08.999 --> 59:11.999
"There's something out there."
Plus I'm really not good in the
morning.

59:11.999 --> 59:13.999
[Justin] But hey,
you made it. That's great.

59:13.999 --> 59:16.334
- I thought we were
gonna do this alone.
- Look! There they are.

59:16.334 --> 59:18.999
That's the white cliffs.
That's where the stone is.

59:18.999 --> 59:21.999
Oh. It's so far away.

59:21.999 --> 59:23.999
There it is again.
We're so close.

59:23.999 --> 59:24.999
Come on.

59:27.334 --> 59:28.999
- [thudding]
- [Gisele squeaks]

59:32.999 --> 59:33.999
<i>Hola.</i>

59:35.999 --> 59:36.999
I'm going to be at
the pool later.

59:36.999 --> 59:38.167
- FYI.
- Oh, hey!

59:38.167 --> 59:40.999
Jerry. Jerry.
Wait. Please. Look.

59:40.999 --> 59:42.999
- Oh.
- You've gotta
help me out here.

59:42.999 --> 59:43.999
What... What now?

59:43.999 --> 59:46.999
I can't remember anything
before the first grade

59:46.999 --> 59:49.334
and my brother and sister
never came back last night.

59:49.334 --> 59:50.999
I don't know why
you're telling me this.

59:50.999 --> 59:52.999
Maybe you should go tell
your parents, kid.

59:52.999 --> 59:58.501
Um... Well, I'm trying to do
that, but it's a little hard.

59:59.999 --> 01:00:01.999
They went to try to find
the Stone of Dreams.

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:06.999
What? But that's
incredibly dangerous.

01:00:06.999 --> 01:00:08.999
Yeah, well, it was
kind of your idea.

01:00:08.999 --> 01:00:10.999
I didn't think they'd
actually try and do it.

01:00:10.999 --> 01:00:13.999
Look, you're
the only person I know

01:00:13.999 --> 01:00:16.334
that can help me find them.
Please.

01:00:23.999 --> 01:00:27.999
All right. Come on,
I've got a map.

01:00:31.501 --> 01:00:33.999
The problem is it doesn't
tell you where to start.

01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:35.999
- Yeah.
- I mean, we could...

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.999
Oh, my gosh, is that
a treasure map?

01:00:37.999 --> 01:00:41.334
A treasure map? No.
Don't be ridiculous.

01:00:41.334 --> 01:00:43.999
It is!
It is a treasure map.

01:00:43.999 --> 01:00:46.999
Well, I mean,
not one that works.

01:00:46.999 --> 01:00:48.999
Well, it is. It's just that
we're missing a part.

01:00:48.999 --> 01:00:52.167
My brother Justin and my
sister... what's her name...

01:00:52.167 --> 01:00:54.876
They had something that's
supposed to go in this corner.

01:00:54.876 --> 01:00:58.000
Uh, there's a picture
of a fort with this...

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.876
I don't know how to describe it.
This gargoyle thingy on it.

01:01:01.876 --> 01:01:02.999
Well, that could be anywhere.

01:01:02.999 --> 01:01:03.999
Oh, I know where that is.

01:01:03.999 --> 01:01:06.999
I saw that on
my artifact tour yesterday.

01:01:06.999 --> 01:01:10.999
It's right, um... Oh, wait.
Do I get to come with?

01:01:12.999 --> 01:01:13.999
[whispering] Yes.

01:01:15.999 --> 01:01:18.999
- No.
- [scoffs] Why?

01:01:18.999 --> 01:01:21.334
You afraid you'll have to
spend a little time with me?

01:01:22.709 --> 01:01:23.999
No. I wouldn't...
It's just there's a...

01:01:25.999 --> 01:01:28.999
We need to...
[spluttering] Tell her.

01:01:28.999 --> 01:01:30.999
That would be wonderful.

01:01:30.999 --> 01:01:32.999
- Oh! This is going
to be so much fun.
- What?

01:01:32.999 --> 01:01:35.167
- Yeah.
- I'll drive
if that's OK with you.

01:01:35.167 --> 01:01:36.999
What?

01:01:37.999 --> 01:01:39.999
You've got to learn
to let me do the talking.

01:01:39.999 --> 01:01:41.999
[Theresa] Let's go, boys!

01:01:47.999 --> 01:01:50.999
The map kind of
ends here. Uh...

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:53.709
Says we have to
find a cave.

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:56.999
A cave? Somewhere
in a mile of cliffs?

01:01:58.999 --> 01:02:00.999
Well, that really
narrows it down, doesn't it?

01:02:00.999 --> 01:02:04.999
[reading Spanish]

01:02:04.999 --> 01:02:08.999
"The one who knows the least
shall lead the way."

01:02:08.999 --> 01:02:11.167
Alex! Sorry.

01:02:11.167 --> 01:02:12.999
It's a reflex.

01:02:12.999 --> 01:02:15.999
Oh, no, it's OK.
I was about to say me, too.

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:17.999
All right,
let's look.

01:02:17.999 --> 01:02:19.999
OK, um, I think that
this indentation

01:02:19.999 --> 01:02:21.999
corresponds with
that indentation on the cliffs.

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:25.876
[man] Yes, but that indentation
corresponds to that indentation
to the cliffs there.

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:27.999
- [Justin] Ah.
- Why don't we just ask someone?

01:02:30.167 --> 01:02:32.167
OK. I think this patch
of greenery could be

01:02:32.167 --> 01:02:34.876
- that patch of greenery.
- But there's a bush there.

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:36.999
- Oh, there's a bush.
- No one ever listens to me.

01:02:36.999 --> 01:02:38.999
There's lots of
patches of green.

01:02:38.999 --> 01:02:41.999
Have you noticed that the
whole place is one giant
patch of greenery?

01:02:41.999 --> 01:02:44.999
- [bleating]
- Excuse me. Sorry. Hi. OK.

01:02:46.334 --> 01:02:47.999
[shuddering] Ooh.

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:51.334
[speaking in Spanish]

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:54.334
Hi! I'm Alex! I'm so sorry
to bother you,

01:02:54.334 --> 01:02:55.999
but I really need
your help.

01:02:57.709 --> 01:03:00.999
English? No?
Of course, not.

01:03:00.999 --> 01:03:02.999
[speaking Spanish]

01:03:02.999 --> 01:03:05.999
Oh, thank you.
They're new, actually.

01:03:05.999 --> 01:03:07.999
I just... No! Cave.
I'm sorry.

01:03:07.999 --> 01:03:10.167
I'm looking for a
cave. Cave.

01:03:10.167 --> 01:03:11.999
You know, like...

01:03:11.999 --> 01:03:14.999
[mimicking echo]
<i>Hola! Hola. Hola.</i>

01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:17.999
[speaking Spanish]

01:03:17.999 --> 01:03:20.999
I'm sorry. Could you slow down
just a little bit?

01:03:20.999 --> 01:03:23.999
Maybe some hand gestures
would be good, too.

01:03:24.999 --> 01:03:26.999
Wait.

01:03:26.999 --> 01:03:30.999
"In Spanish class I took
a nap then, how about
a floating caption?"

01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:33.999
[speaking Spanish]

01:03:33.999 --> 01:03:37.999
"I think she's looking
for a cave." Yes. Exactly.
That's it. Where is it?

01:03:38.999 --> 01:03:42.501
"Maybe if we just keep smiling
and nodding she'll go away."

01:03:43.999 --> 01:03:46.999
"I wonder why she looks
like she's been sleeping
on the ground."

01:03:47.999 --> 01:03:49.999
"I wonder if she knows
how bad her breath..."

01:03:51.167 --> 01:03:53.999
OK. We're good. Never mind.
Sorry to bother you.

01:03:53.999 --> 01:03:56.999
Could've just stuck with,
"Don't know where the cave is."

01:04:04.999 --> 01:04:05.999
<i>Cueva?</i>

01:04:07.501 --> 01:04:09.999
"The one who knows the least..."

01:04:09.999 --> 01:04:12.999
And since it's not me, it's you.
Do you know where the cave is?

01:04:14.999 --> 01:04:17.999
I don't suppose you have a
breath mint on you, do you?

01:04:17.999 --> 01:04:19.999
No? OK.

01:04:25.334 --> 01:04:27.709
[Theresa speaking Spanish]

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:31.999
It says that the path
will only reveal itself

01:04:31.999 --> 01:04:34.501
to the one whose
intentions are pure.

01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:37.167
What the heck
does that mean?

01:04:37.167 --> 01:04:39.709
It means it's probably
time for you to go.

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:42.334
Thank you so much for your help,
but we've got it from here.

01:04:42.334 --> 01:04:44.999
No way! I'm not going now and
let you two have all the fun.

01:04:44.999 --> 01:04:48.000
Besides, neither of you two
read Spanish, right?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.999
Right.

01:04:51.999 --> 01:04:54.709
So I guess we're going to have
to figure this out together.

01:04:54.709 --> 01:04:55.999
Mm-hm.

01:04:55.999 --> 01:04:58.999
The time for that
is way over, people...

01:04:58.999 --> 01:05:01.999
Whoever you are. Look, tick
tock. We've gotta get moving.

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:05.501
But we can't...
You know.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:07.876
Uh, hey, lady.
Look over there.

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:11.167
[Theresa] What?
Do you see something?

01:05:11.167 --> 01:05:12.999
I don't see anything.

01:05:14.334 --> 01:05:17.000
[Jerry] Yeah, yeah,
there's the ship...

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.999
[Theresa] I think
that's a bird.

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:21.999
Look! Right...
There's a path.

01:05:21.999 --> 01:05:24.999
[stammering] I didn't
even see that. Come on.

01:05:25.999 --> 01:05:26.999
Come on.

01:05:26.999 --> 01:05:28.999
Wait. Where did that come from?

01:05:39.999 --> 01:05:41.999
[panting]

01:05:44.999 --> 01:05:46.999
[Gisele yelping]

01:05:46.999 --> 01:05:50.334
[Alex pants] I don't suppose you
have a flashlight on you,
do you?

01:05:50.999 --> 01:05:53.999
Oh. Allow me.

01:05:57.999 --> 01:05:59.876
- [wind gusting]
- [squawks]

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:02.501
That's pretty much
all I've got.

01:06:07.876 --> 01:06:11.999
My magic's not working.
The cave must be enchanted.

01:06:11.999 --> 01:06:14.999
Mine's not working either. But
I like that "enchanted" excuse.

01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:15.999
I'm gonna have to use that.

01:06:15.999 --> 01:06:17.501
Me too.

01:06:17.501 --> 01:06:20.167
[exhaling] You two can
wait here if you want.

01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:22.167
What, let you two
go alone? No, no, no.

01:06:22.167 --> 01:06:24.999
I've learned from my mistakes.
We're in this together.

01:06:24.999 --> 01:06:26.501
Ow. Ow. Ow!

01:06:27.999 --> 01:06:30.167
Here's an idea.
We stay here.

01:06:33.999 --> 01:06:37.167
OK. You ready?

01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:40.999
No. But let's go.

01:06:44.999 --> 01:06:47.999
Good luck.
See you soon.

01:06:48.999 --> 01:06:50.167
Watch out for the bats.

01:06:50.167 --> 01:06:53.999
And the spiders.
And the scorpions.

01:06:53.999 --> 01:06:55.999
- And the snakes.
- We got it!

01:06:56.999 --> 01:06:59.999
See ya.
Wouldn't want to be ya.

01:06:59.999 --> 01:07:00.999
[Gisele croaking]

01:07:00.999 --> 01:07:02.999
[Theresa] Hang on. On three.

01:07:02.999 --> 01:07:04.999
- One...
- I can't feel my legs!

01:07:04.999 --> 01:07:06.999
One, two, three!

01:07:06.999 --> 01:07:08.999
[all yelling]

01:07:08.999 --> 01:07:11.999
I'm still in here, guys!
I'm not having any fun!

01:07:11.999 --> 01:07:14.999
Why am I not laying out
by the pool?

01:07:14.999 --> 01:07:17.334
- Twice is a charm.
Let's go. Dad, come on!
- Grab it! Grab it!

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:20.334
- One, two, three.
- Why do you have to count
to three? Just pull!

01:07:20.334 --> 01:07:24.167
- [all yelling]
- It's slippery!

01:07:31.999 --> 01:07:34.999
Do we even know that
this is the right cave?

01:07:43.999 --> 01:07:46.999
I'm gonna go with "yes,"
but that's just a hunch.

01:07:57.999 --> 01:08:00.999
- [bats screeching]
- [both exclaiming]

01:08:02.501 --> 01:08:04.999
This <i>piedra </i> thing better
reverse the spell

01:08:04.999 --> 01:08:07.999
or else I just got bat poop
in my hair for nothing.

01:08:07.999 --> 01:08:11.999
It's the Stone of Dreams. It can
do anything. Reverse any spell.

01:08:11.999 --> 01:08:15.999
Show you the future. But you
only get one chance at it.

01:08:19.999 --> 01:08:23.999
I'm sorry.
For everything.

01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:24.999
What?

01:08:25.999 --> 01:08:29.999
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

01:08:31.999 --> 01:08:34.999
I heard you the first time.
I just wanted to hear you
say it again.

01:08:35.999 --> 01:08:37.999
Wow. It's amazing.

01:08:37.999 --> 01:08:39.999
Even in the face
of the most imminent doom,

01:08:39.999 --> 01:08:41.999
you can still be
super annoying.

01:08:41.999 --> 01:08:45.167
- It's one of the few things
I learned from you.
- Ha. Still doing it.

01:08:50.999 --> 01:08:51.999
I'm sorry, too.

01:08:51.999 --> 01:08:53.999
What are you sorry for?

01:08:55.999 --> 01:08:56.999
You're my little sister.

01:08:58.876 --> 01:09:01.999
I shouldn't be on you as much.
We need each other.

01:09:03.999 --> 01:09:06.999
Wait. What was that?

01:09:07.999 --> 01:09:10.999
I know.
I'm not saying it again.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.501
A path of stone? Hmm.

01:09:21.999 --> 01:09:24.000
I don't know, maybe there's
a path along the edge.

01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:30.999
Or a giant bridge
right here in the middle!

01:09:30.999 --> 01:09:32.999
But... How...

01:09:32.999 --> 01:09:35.999
I don't know.
It just... Wow!

01:09:35.999 --> 01:09:38.999
Bridge just came and it's...
You know, there's a, uh...

01:09:38.999 --> 01:09:41.999
OK, not our biggest
problem right now.

01:09:41.999 --> 01:09:44.167
Is it weird that I can't
remember what I got for
Christmas?

01:09:44.167 --> 01:09:48.999
Look, if you don't
want to go on, it's OK.

01:09:50.999 --> 01:09:52.501
Are you kidding me?

01:09:52.501 --> 01:09:55.999
What kind of woman doesn't want
a little magic in her life?

01:09:55.999 --> 01:09:57.999
Let's go.

01:10:00.999 --> 01:10:03.999
You know, for a
mortal woman, she is...

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:06.999
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.
She's a keeper. Come on.

01:10:06.999 --> 01:10:07.999
Ow.

01:10:08.999 --> 01:10:10.999
I like the way she walks.

01:10:18.999 --> 01:10:20.999
So this is definitely the place.

01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:23.999
But...how are we
going to find the stone?

01:10:23.999 --> 01:10:25.999
It could be any one of these.

01:10:25.999 --> 01:10:27.999
I'm guessing
it's that one.

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:37.999
Yeah, good guess.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.999
Careful!

01:10:44.999 --> 01:10:48.999
Well, someone should put up
a railing or something.

01:10:48.999 --> 01:10:51.999
Seriously, it's dangerous.

01:10:58.999 --> 01:11:02.999
OK. I'll go.

01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:06.167
I agree. You go.

01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:10.501
[whispering] OK.

01:11:13.999 --> 01:11:15.999
[rumbling]

01:11:18.999 --> 01:11:20.999
- Whoa!
- [gasping]

01:11:23.999 --> 01:11:25.999
[exhaling]

01:11:25.999 --> 01:11:27.999
Try this one.

01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:35.999
[gasps] OK.

01:11:36.999 --> 01:11:37.999
Almost there.

01:11:40.999 --> 01:11:41.999
[groans]

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:46.167
[whispering] Don't look down.
Don't look down.

01:11:48.167 --> 01:11:50.999
Look up. Look up. Look up.

01:11:50.999 --> 01:11:51.999
[whimpering]

01:11:51.999 --> 01:11:54.999
Don't look down.
Don't look down.

01:11:55.999 --> 01:11:57.999
Don't... [gasping]

01:12:00.876 --> 01:12:01.999
[Alex] Careful.

01:12:01.999 --> 01:12:04.999
Hold on to the torch thing.
But not the hot part.

01:12:05.999 --> 01:12:08.999
Why would I grab the hot part?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.999
[Alex] Watch your foot.
Watch your foot.

01:12:20.999 --> 01:12:23.999
- [crashing]
- [both gasping]

01:12:23.999 --> 01:12:26.709
[whispering] I got it.
Thank you, column.

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:28.999
Don't step on the crumbly parts!

01:12:28.999 --> 01:12:30.999
They're all crumbly parts!

01:12:39.999 --> 01:12:41.000
Watch it, watch it.

01:12:47.999 --> 01:12:49.501
Justin!

01:12:49.501 --> 01:12:51.999
[ground rumbling]

01:12:54.999 --> 01:12:55.999
[gasping, grunting]

01:12:58.999 --> 01:13:01.999
- Justin!
- OK! I'm OK!

01:13:03.999 --> 01:13:04.999
Where's the stone?

01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:07.999
I see it.

01:13:09.999 --> 01:13:10.999
I think I can reach it.

01:13:10.999 --> 01:13:14.999
- No! It's too dangerous.
- I have to try.

01:13:14.999 --> 01:13:16.999
We don't really
have a choice here.

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:25.876
[grunting]

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.709
[grunting]

01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:42.999
I got it!

01:13:44.999 --> 01:13:45.999
[whispering] I got it.

01:13:48.999 --> 01:13:51.999
[screaming] Justin! Justin!

01:13:54.999 --> 01:13:57.999
I got you.
I won't let you fall.

01:13:57.999 --> 01:13:58.999
[grunting]

01:14:01.999 --> 01:14:05.334
We did it. It's not too late.
We can fix everything.

01:14:08.999 --> 01:14:11.999
- [parrot squawking]
- No! What are you doing?
Come back!

01:14:14.999 --> 01:14:17.999
Whoa! What?

01:14:17.999 --> 01:14:19.999
- Did you guys get it?
- Is everyone OK?

01:14:19.999 --> 01:14:21.999
- Dad!
- Mom!

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:25.999
I'm so, so sorry. I was
wrong and you were right.

01:14:25.999 --> 01:14:27.999
I'll even repeat it
if you want me to.

01:14:27.999 --> 01:14:29.999
- I can't do this on my own.
I need you.
- [mouths]

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:32.999
I need your help.

01:14:32.999 --> 01:14:35.999
Oh Max, how did you do it?
How did you reverse the spell?

01:14:35.999 --> 01:14:36.999
Um, I didn't.

01:14:36.999 --> 01:14:39.999
Seriously, what is
with all this hugging?

01:14:43.999 --> 01:14:45.999
You don't know
who I am, do you?

01:14:46.999 --> 01:14:50.999
Sorry. Wait...

01:14:50.999 --> 01:14:52.999
I do know you.

01:14:53.999 --> 01:14:56.999
You work at the resort.

01:14:56.999 --> 01:15:00.999
The other day at the pool when
you guys were asking about
reversing that spell...

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:05.876
Who are you guys?

01:15:05.999 --> 01:15:07.999
Hey, Dad.

01:15:07.999 --> 01:15:11.999
- "Dad"? You didn't tell me
you were married.
- What?

01:15:11.999 --> 01:15:13.999
Would somebody please explain
to me what's going on?

01:15:15.999 --> 01:15:19.999
[Theresa] No. This is
ridiculous. Would you
listen to yourselves?

01:15:19.999 --> 01:15:20.999
Three kids...

01:15:20.999 --> 01:15:23.334
I'm a 16 year-old girl.

01:15:23.334 --> 01:15:25.999
Will you please
stop calling me a kid?

01:15:25.999 --> 01:15:26.999
That was actually
one of our issues.

01:15:26.999 --> 01:15:29.999
OK. Three whatevers.

01:15:29.999 --> 01:15:32.999
OK, fine. I think
I liked "kids" better.

01:15:32.999 --> 01:15:35.876
Three kids show up
and say we're their parents?

01:15:35.876 --> 01:15:39.709
It doesn't make any sense.
I mean, I think I'd remember.

01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:42.999
No offense, but if you
remembered, we wouldn't be
having this problem.

01:15:42.999 --> 01:15:46.167
And we're supposedly married.
We are not married.

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:48.999
She's right. I mean,
I don't get it.

01:15:48.999 --> 01:15:50.999
I swore I would never...

01:15:50.999 --> 01:15:52.000
Never what?

01:15:55.999 --> 01:15:59.999
I swore I would never
fall in love with a mortal.

01:15:59.999 --> 01:16:00.999
And now?

01:16:02.999 --> 01:16:05.999
Well, I... There's...

01:16:05.999 --> 01:16:09.999
OK. Tell me that you're
not falling for me

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:11.999
and then we'll
know this isn't real.

01:16:13.876 --> 01:16:14.999
I can't tell you that.

01:16:17.501 --> 01:16:18.999
Look, kiss. Don't kiss.

01:16:18.999 --> 01:16:20.999
I don't have time to be
squeamish over this.

01:16:20.999 --> 01:16:21.999
We have to do something.

01:16:21.999 --> 01:16:25.999
He's right. How did you do
the spell in the first place?

01:16:27.999 --> 01:16:30.167
I did it.

01:16:30.167 --> 01:16:31.999
But I didn't mean to, I swear.

01:16:31.999 --> 01:16:33.999
Maybe at first I meant
it a little bit,

01:16:33.999 --> 01:16:38.999
but then after...
I used your wand.

01:16:40.999 --> 01:16:41.999
This wand?

01:16:44.999 --> 01:16:46.000
Can't you do something?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.999
Um...

01:16:55.999 --> 01:16:58.999
No. I'm sorry.
I wish that I...

01:16:58.999 --> 01:17:02.999
But it says here
that maybe one of you
can reverse the spell.

01:17:04.876 --> 01:17:05.999
But you have to be
a full wizard.

01:17:05.999 --> 01:17:08.999
Oh. The wizard competition
is years away.

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:10.334
People, I have minutes.

01:17:12.999 --> 01:17:14.999
It doesn't have to
be years away.

01:17:17.999 --> 01:17:19.999
I'm... I'm not ready.

01:17:19.999 --> 01:17:21.999
We have to do this.

01:17:26.999 --> 01:17:31.999
If I don't do this, then...
they disappear forever.

01:17:33.999 --> 01:17:37.999
Mom, it'll be OK.
I promise.

01:17:37.999 --> 01:17:41.999
Uh, I'm sorry. I think you
have the wrong woman.

01:17:42.999 --> 01:17:46.167
I would not
forget my own kid.

01:17:47.999 --> 01:17:48.999
I've gotta go.

01:17:48.999 --> 01:17:50.334
Mom!

01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:53.999
So is that lady your mom?

01:17:56.876 --> 01:17:58.999
Max, don't you
remember who that is?

01:17:59.999 --> 01:18:00.999
Should I?

01:18:00.999 --> 01:18:01.999
We've got to do this now.

01:18:01.999 --> 01:18:03.709
Everybody grab the wand.

01:18:06.999 --> 01:18:07.999
[both] Max!

01:18:08.999 --> 01:18:09.999
Max!

01:18:13.999 --> 01:18:15.999
I do remember you.

01:18:15.999 --> 01:18:18.501
Stay focused. It's the only way
to get him back.

01:18:18.501 --> 01:18:22.999
It's only a matter
of minutes before time
catches up with you, too.

01:18:22.999 --> 01:18:25.167
A full wizard
there can be but one.

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:28.999
All power
to a daughter or son.

01:18:28.999 --> 01:18:31.000
To an ancient battle,
transport us three.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.999
Where one will emerge
in victory.

01:18:39.999 --> 01:18:41.999
Justin? Dad?

01:19:09.876 --> 01:19:12.501
[rumbling, cracking]

01:19:23.999 --> 01:19:26.999
Alex! What the...?

01:19:26.999 --> 01:19:28.999
[thunder rumbling]

01:19:33.999 --> 01:19:34.999
Ready?

01:19:34.999 --> 01:19:37.999
What do you mean "ready?"
We don't even have our wands.

01:19:45.999 --> 01:19:49.876
It's simple. Whoever captures
the power first...

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:56.999
...keeps it all.

01:19:57.999 --> 01:19:59.999
The loser gets nothing.
Do you understand?

01:20:01.999 --> 01:20:04.999
And if you don't try,
it won't work.

01:20:04.999 --> 01:20:07.999
- But then...
- It won't even matter.

01:20:07.999 --> 01:20:11.999
It'll be too late.
We'll try our hardest.

01:20:15.167 --> 01:20:16.999
I'm sorry.

01:20:27.999 --> 01:20:29.876
[Jerry] The rules are simple.

01:20:29.876 --> 01:20:32.999
The only spells you're allowed
to use are those involving

01:20:32.999 --> 01:20:37.999
the four elements.
Earth, air, fire and water.

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:41.501
What? Nobody said
anything about that!

01:20:41.501 --> 01:20:43.876
Are... Did you know that?

01:20:44.999 --> 01:20:47.999
I've been studying battle spells
for the past ten years
of my life.

01:20:47.999 --> 01:20:49.999
Do you know how many
spells I memorized?

01:20:49.999 --> 01:20:52.999
The best wizards can do
the most with the least.

01:20:52.999 --> 01:20:55.999
Good, because that's
pretty much all I've got.

01:20:55.999 --> 01:20:58.999
OK. Wands at the ready!

01:21:00.999 --> 01:21:01.999
Good luck.

01:21:03.999 --> 01:21:04.999
Good luck.

01:21:04.999 --> 01:21:09.876
Ready. Set. Magic!

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:12.999
Oh, we're going. OK.

01:21:16.999 --> 01:21:17.999
Justin!

01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:07.999
[grunting]

01:22:38.501 --> 01:22:40.999
Hurry. You're running
out of time!

01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:42.709
[thunder crashing]

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.999
Was the lightning
really necessary?

01:22:47.999 --> 01:22:50.334
You know how unpredictable
storms can be.

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:01.999
Quit doing that!

01:23:08.999 --> 01:23:12.999
Don't look at me. Magic does
whatever it wants. Go!

01:23:18.999 --> 01:23:21.999
- Seriously?
- Sorry. Don't know
a lot of spells. [chuckles]

01:23:21.999 --> 01:23:25.999
- [Gisele] No, Archie.
- [Archie] Gisele,
why are you doing this?

01:23:25.999 --> 01:23:27.999
If you could stop
and talk to me...

01:23:27.999 --> 01:23:30.334
Don't get me wrong, you
were a great pair of legs

01:23:30.334 --> 01:23:33.999
when I needed them, but
I have my own now. [giggles]

01:23:33.999 --> 01:23:37.999
But I did all of this so we
could be together. For us.

01:23:37.999 --> 01:23:39.999
Oh, is that what you thought?

01:23:40.999 --> 01:23:41.999
That's what you said.

01:23:41.999 --> 01:23:44.501
[giggling] I was lying.

01:23:44.501 --> 01:23:47.999
Archie, why don't
you get yourself a life?

01:23:47.999 --> 01:23:49.999
Or at least
a decent magic act.

01:23:50.999 --> 01:23:52.999
Could I at least
get a goodbye hug?

01:23:52.999 --> 01:23:54.999
[sighing]

01:24:00.999 --> 01:24:05.999
You. You were that bird!

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:08.709
[scoffing] I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:10.999
[coughing]

01:24:12.999 --> 01:24:14.999
Yesterday, that would have
freaked me out.

01:24:14.999 --> 01:24:18.709
[spits] But now,
I need the stone.

01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:20.000
I don't think so.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.999
Look, I don't know what is going
on. I'm not part of your world.

01:24:23.999 --> 01:24:26.999
But I do know that I just got
my heart ripped out by this boy

01:24:26.999 --> 01:24:30.167
I didn't even know I knew,
let alone loved.

01:24:30.167 --> 01:24:33.709
And his father, who may
or may not be my husband...

01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:35.999
You know, I wouldn't even
mind if he was my husband...

01:24:35.999 --> 01:24:38.167
and these other two kids,
these wonderful kids.

01:24:38.167 --> 01:24:41.999
It's... Look, it's a long story.
But they need that stone.

01:24:41.999 --> 01:24:44.876
And I intend to get it
one way or another.

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:48.999
- [gasping]
- I'm not letting those kids

01:24:48.999 --> 01:24:51.999
turn me into the authorities.
I just got my life back.

01:24:51.999 --> 01:24:54.999
Why don't you look at this
as a fresh start?

01:24:54.999 --> 01:24:58.334
From what I can see, it didn't
look like you and your daughter
got along so well.

01:24:58.334 --> 01:25:01.999
There are a lot of moms who'd
like to be in your position.

01:25:01.999 --> 01:25:05.876
There isn't one.
Give me the stone.

01:25:05.876 --> 01:25:07.999
- [laughing]
- You mean this one?

01:25:09.501 --> 01:25:12.000
How did...?
What are you doing?

01:25:13.501 --> 01:25:14.999
It's the first trick
of my new act.

01:25:16.999 --> 01:25:17.999
It's a doozy.

01:25:18.999 --> 01:25:21.999
What did you...?
What are you...?

01:25:23.999 --> 01:25:26.000
[squawking]

01:25:26.999 --> 01:25:30.999
You didn't...
What are you...? Oh no.

01:25:30.999 --> 01:25:32.000
[squawks]

01:25:40.999 --> 01:25:43.999
[squawking]

01:25:44.999 --> 01:25:46.999
Turns out, I like you
better as a bird.

01:25:56.999 --> 01:25:57.999
Thank you.

01:26:26.999 --> 01:26:27.999
[sighing]

01:26:30.999 --> 01:26:32.999
A little variation
of that puddle spell.

01:26:32.999 --> 01:26:35.876
- Justin!
- We have to end this.

01:26:42.999 --> 01:26:44.334
[Alex] That's it.

01:27:15.501 --> 01:27:19.999
I did it! I won!
I'm a full wizard.

01:27:21.999 --> 01:27:23.999
[laughing] Wow!

01:27:32.999 --> 01:27:35.999
I never knew how great this
would feel. This is amazing.

01:27:37.501 --> 01:27:38.876
Congratulations.

01:27:38.876 --> 01:27:41.999
See? I told you,
you were ready.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
- Justin...
- No, it's... it's fine.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.334
OK. Quick! You need
to do the spell now.

01:27:48.334 --> 01:27:50.334
Um, right. OK. Um...

01:27:51.999 --> 01:27:53.334
But I... I don't
know what to do.

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:55.999
Uh, Justin, help me.
What spell do I use?

01:27:55.999 --> 01:27:57.999
Why would I help you?

01:27:57.999 --> 01:28:01.999
Because you're my brother.

01:28:01.999 --> 01:28:03.999
- Look, I'm sorry you didn't...
- I'm your brother?

01:28:05.999 --> 01:28:08.999
No. No. No, Justin.

01:28:09.999 --> 01:28:13.999
Please, please, you can't leave
me here. Please remember.

01:28:13.999 --> 01:28:16.999
I'm Alex.
I'm your little sister.

01:28:16.999 --> 01:28:19.999
I taunt you and tease
you and make your life
miserable,

01:28:19.999 --> 01:28:20.999
but you love me anyway.

01:28:22.999 --> 01:28:25.999
You're everything that
I've ever wanted to be.

01:28:27.999 --> 01:28:32.999
I'm jealous of how...
how smart you are and
how kind and how nice.

01:28:33.999 --> 01:28:35.999
Please don't leave me here.

01:28:37.999 --> 01:28:39.999
I'd never leave you.

01:28:40.999 --> 01:28:43.501
I don't know
who you are, but...

01:28:45.999 --> 01:28:46.999
...but I believe you.

01:28:51.999 --> 01:28:53.999
OK. What spell do I use?

01:28:53.999 --> 01:28:58.501
[stammering] What's going on?
I don't... I don't know
the situation.

01:29:00.999 --> 01:29:02.999
No! Justin!

01:29:04.999 --> 01:29:07.999
Justin! No!

01:29:07.999 --> 01:29:11.999
You have to help me! Justin
should have won this, not me!

01:29:11.999 --> 01:29:13.999
Just be calm.
You can do this.

01:29:15.999 --> 01:29:18.999
Reverse the spell,
don't make me scream and yell.

01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:23.999
Try another one. Focus.

01:29:23.999 --> 01:29:28.999
Because of words of hate,
do not my brothers take.

01:29:28.999 --> 01:29:33.000
I don't know how to do this.
Please help me.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.999
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I think it's too late.

01:29:40.999 --> 01:29:43.999
No, it can't be too late.

01:29:43.999 --> 01:29:48.999
Hey! Would this help?

01:29:51.999 --> 01:29:54.999
- The stone.
- Be careful.
You only have one wish.

01:29:54.999 --> 01:29:56.999
But if you do it right,

01:29:56.999 --> 01:29:59.709
you can get your brothers back
and still be a full wizard.

01:29:59.709 --> 01:30:03.999
Just... Just wish
for them to reappear.

01:30:05.999 --> 01:30:06.999
OK?

01:30:08.999 --> 01:30:12.999
But... No.

01:30:15.999 --> 01:30:17.999
No, it's much more than that.

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:24.999
I want everything to be
exactly the way it was.

01:30:28.999 --> 01:30:30.876
[gasping]

01:30:31.999 --> 01:30:34.999
- [Theresa] Alex?
- Mom?

01:30:34.999 --> 01:30:37.999
The minute Justin tried to
magically glue me to my chair,

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:38.999
I knew something was up.

01:30:38.999 --> 01:30:42.167
You will just not stop,
will you?

01:30:42.999 --> 01:30:45.999
- Mom!
- Oof!

01:30:45.999 --> 01:30:47.999
I am so, so sorry.

01:30:47.999 --> 01:30:51.167
I could never hate you. I love
you. You know that, right?

01:30:51.167 --> 01:30:53.999
And I'm not just saying that.
I mean that.

01:30:53.999 --> 01:30:55.999
Well, yeah, of course,
I know that, honey.

01:30:55.999 --> 01:30:58.999
- But you're still grounded.
- Yes, I know.

01:30:58.999 --> 01:31:03.999
I can't wait to be grounded.
Ground me, take away
my magic, I don't care.

01:31:03.999 --> 01:31:06.999
OK. As long as you've
learned your lesson.

01:31:06.999 --> 01:31:08.709
Oh.

01:31:09.876 --> 01:31:10.999
[Justin] Hey, Alex!

01:31:10.999 --> 01:31:12.999
Justin! Max!

01:31:13.999 --> 01:31:15.999
You miss your brothers?

01:31:17.999 --> 01:31:18.999
Justin! Max!

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.709
Hey.

01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:23.999
What did you do?

01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:29.999
You gave up your powers.

01:31:31.501 --> 01:31:33.999
You won.
Why would you do that?

01:31:33.999 --> 01:31:37.999
Because I wanted to make sure
that nothing was different.

01:31:37.999 --> 01:31:39.999
That nothing changed.

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:45.999
Next time this comes around,
I am not taking it easy.

01:31:45.999 --> 01:31:48.999
- Oh, whatever. Taking it easy?
- With all the puddles...

01:31:48.999 --> 01:31:50.709
Yo! People. Hey.
I'm right here.

01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:52.334
Yes you are and I
love you for that.

01:31:52.334 --> 01:31:54.999
[Jerry] Hey.
Oh, what is going on?

01:31:54.999 --> 01:31:57.876
Uh, hugging. I'm not
quite sure I know why.

01:31:57.876 --> 01:31:58.999
- Dad!
- Mom!

01:31:58.999 --> 01:32:01.000
- Whoa!
- Ooh! A lot of hugging.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.999
- Hey.
- OK.

01:32:02.999 --> 01:32:04.000
Excuse me. Alex.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.999
Oh, right, Javier.

01:32:06.999 --> 01:32:10.999
Alex, honey, if you want
to go for an hour,

01:32:10.999 --> 01:32:12.999
- I'd be OK with that.
- Mm-hmm.

01:32:13.999 --> 01:32:14.999
Well, I wouldn't be.

01:32:14.999 --> 01:32:17.999
Javier, why don't you
go find someone else

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:19.999
who doesn't have their mom
watching out for them.

01:32:21.999 --> 01:32:23.999
Yeah. Goodbye!

01:32:23.999 --> 01:32:26.999
Oh, here, I'll take a picture.
I'll set it up.

01:32:26.999 --> 01:32:29.999
Uh, that's OK.

01:32:29.999 --> 01:32:31.999
I think we have
enough pictures.

01:32:31.999 --> 01:32:35.999
Besides, I'll definitely
remember this moment
without one.

01:32:36.999 --> 01:32:37.999
[speaking Spanish]

01:32:37.999 --> 01:32:39.999
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:32:41.999 --> 01:32:44.999
Hey, I got a great idea.
Let's go see some wizard sites.

01:32:44.999 --> 01:32:46.709
Oh, no.

01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:48.999
- This is a vacation, honey.
- [parrot squawking]

01:32:48.999 --> 01:32:52.999
- Oh! Stupid bird.
- [Max laughing]

01:32:52.999 --> 01:32:55.999
[Jerry] Hey, don't laugh.
It's good luck, honey.
