(Elizabeth)
Personal log, June 16, 2262.

00:15.833 --> 00:17.667
My first CO once told me

00:17.750 --> 00:20.250
"When someone asks you
why you took on a job

00:20.333 --> 00:22.125
"the worst answer
you can give is

00:22.208 --> 00:24.250
because a friend asked me to."

00:24.333 --> 00:25.792
I should have listened.

00:25.875 --> 00:29.625
This place is one long
exercise in frustration.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.333
[coughing]

00:35.042 --> 00:37.083
After I denied permission
to the telepaths

00:37.167 --> 00:39.417
who came here
asking to form a colony

00:39.500 --> 00:42.333
President Sheridan
overrode my decision.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.292
Now, they've walled themselves
up in Brown Sector.

00:45.375 --> 00:46.917
They've welded,
shut the air doors

00:47.000 --> 00:50.208
disabled the tubes
and the access wells.

00:50.292 --> 00:52.208
They're dug in so deep
it'll take forever

00:52.292 --> 00:54.083
to get them out again.

00:54.167 --> 00:57.708
But we can't wait forever,
and neither can they.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.208
Ahh.

01:00.292 --> 01:01.792
I hear they may go
on a hunger strike

01:01.875 --> 01:03.792
until they receive
the homeworld they've demanded

01:03.875 --> 01:07.500
in return for not revealing
everyone's secrets.

01:07.583 --> 01:08.917
I hate hunger strikes.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.542
It's a no-win situation
for everyone.

01:13.792 --> 01:15.917
It'd be nice if Sheridan
could get into this.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.958
He let them stay here. He might
be able to talk them out.

01:20.042 --> 01:22.458
But he's up to his ears
dealing with ambassadors

01:22.542 --> 01:25.042
who are getting bushwhacked
by unknown parties that've been

01:25.125 --> 01:27.208
turning their shipping lanes
into killing zones

01:27.292 --> 01:29.667
and have started blaming
each other.

01:29.750 --> 01:32.125
And they're not exactly happy
about the telepaths

01:32.208 --> 01:34.792
having found out
most of their secrets.

01:34.875 --> 01:36.750
For now, they're more worried
about the attacks

01:36.833 --> 01:39.292
which represent
a money problem.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.667
That's only because they think

01:44.750 --> 01:47.250
all the teeps are holed up
in Brown Sector.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.375
And because they figure
we'll kill the telepaths

01:49.458 --> 01:51.583
when we go in
to dig them out..

01:51.667 --> 01:53.333
...and, who knows?

01:53.417 --> 01:56.833
Before this is all over,
they may be right.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.833
What they don't know, because
I haven't told them yet

02:01.917 --> 02:04.375
is that we think some
of the telepaths got out

02:04.458 --> 02:06.917
before they closed off
Brown 12.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.792
They could be anywhere
on the station by now.

02:09.875 --> 02:13.750
X-factors in this
whole equation.

02:13.833 --> 02:16.458
Londo and G'Kar
are still on Centauri Prime

02:16.542 --> 02:18.542
preparing for Londo's
eventual rise to emperor

02:18.625 --> 02:22.208
when their regent dies, so
they're in no position to help.

02:22.292 --> 02:23.875
I wonder if he could use
a good starship captain

02:23.958 --> 02:27.250
right about now?
I speak a little Centauri.

02:28.542 --> 02:30.417
Well, maybe not.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.417
'I'll just have to find
a way to deal with this.'

02:35.000 --> 02:38.667
'Because I'm here
and it's my command.'

02:39.792 --> 02:41.958
'And why am I here?'

02:44.583 --> 02:46.417
'Cause, although
we've been separated

02:46.500 --> 02:49.917
by a lot of years
and a lot of life

02:50.000 --> 02:52.250
Sheridan's still a friend..

02:52.333 --> 02:54.750
...and he asked for my help.

02:56.250 --> 02:57.583
You know what?

02:57.667 --> 03:00.375
That's still a crummy answer
to the question.

03:00.458 --> 03:01.500
[sighs]

03:01.583 --> 03:04.500
Then again,
maybe I'm just cranky

03:04.583 --> 03:07.958
because I don't think
anyone's gonna like my solution.

03:09.958 --> 03:12.417
The God's honest truth is..

03:12.500 --> 03:15.292
[sighs]
...I don't think we're gonna
get out of this without

03:15.375 --> 03:17.708
a lot of dead people
on the deck..

03:18.875 --> 03:21.208
...maybe a whole lot
of dead people.

03:23.667 --> 03:25.500
[beeps]

03:34.417 --> 03:38.333
- Lochley to C&amp;C.
- 'C&amp;C online.'

03:38.417 --> 03:40.417
I need a secure gold channel
to Earthcom.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.583
Access Earthdome district,
Psi-Corps headquarters.

03:43.667 --> 03:46.292
(male #1)
'Message destination?'

03:46.375 --> 03:48.667
Bester, PSI-Corps.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.125
'Standby.'

03:50.208 --> 03:51.875
'Do you want a header
on the channel interface'

03:51.958 --> 03:53.958
'in case he's not available?'

03:54.042 --> 03:55.708
Yeah.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.667
Yeah, tell him, uh..

03:57.750 --> 03:59.958
...tell him Captain Elizabeth
Lochley called

04:00.042 --> 04:01.792
and, uh, tell him..

04:03.208 --> 04:06.042
...tell him we need his help.

04:06.125 --> 04:08.125
[beeps]

04:13.667 --> 04:15.458
(Kosh)
And so it begins.

04:15.542 --> 04:17.750
There is a hole in your mind.
What do you want?

04:17.833 --> 04:20.708
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

04:20.792 --> 04:22.625
(Jeffrey)
Nothing's the same anymore.

04:22.708 --> 04:24.042
(William)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.167
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate

04:25.250 --> 04:26.458
the entire Narn homeworld..

04:26.542 --> 04:27.833
(Elric)
I see a great hand

04:27.917 --> 04:29.083
reaching out of the stars.

04:29.167 --> 04:30.583
(Sebastian)
Who are you?

04:30.667 --> 04:31.958
(female #1)
President Clark has signed

04:32.042 --> 04:34.000
a decree today
declaring martial law.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.833
(John)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

04:35.917 --> 04:38.333
Unless your people get off
their encounter-suited butts..

04:38.417 --> 04:39.875
(Zathras)
You're the one who was..

04:39.958 --> 04:42.667
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum,
you will die.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.958
(Lorien)
Why are you here? Do you have
anything worth living for?

04:46.042 --> 04:47.625
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

04:47.708 --> 04:49.167
(John)
Giants in the play ground.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.833
Now, get the hell out
of our galaxy!

04:50.917 --> 04:53.792
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

04:56.417 --> 04:59.458
[theme music]

05:29.500 --> 05:32.583
[music continues]

05:42.167 --> 05:45.083
[instrumental music]

05:51.167 --> 05:53.083
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, step down this way.

05:53.167 --> 05:55.750
- So how's it going?
- Well, so far so good.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.417
I got another team
doing the same thing

05:57.500 --> 05:59.250
in Brown 9 as a distraction.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.292
With any luck, before they know
we're here, we'll be inside.

06:02.375 --> 06:04.667
Well, how are they
keeping you out?

06:11.542 --> 06:13.250
They've got patrols
all over the place.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.958
I guess they're sensing
where we are

06:15.042 --> 06:17.667
and as soon as they figure it
out they rush in steel plating

06:17.750 --> 06:19.083
and weld it to the other side.

06:19.167 --> 06:20.625
Yeah, but that takes time

06:20.708 --> 06:23.000
more time than it should take
to burn through a single door.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.083
Yes, it does.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.333
So what's taking you
so long to burn through?

06:32.417 --> 06:35.375
Well, they've got other
ways to slow us down.

06:43.458 --> 06:44.917
No!

06:45.000 --> 06:47.875
(Elizabeth)
What? What is it?

06:47.958 --> 06:49.208
There's a bomb.

06:49.292 --> 06:51.125
There's a bomb
on the other side of the door!

06:51.208 --> 06:53.000
What? Well, how do you know?

06:53.083 --> 06:56.208
- I just know, that's all.
- Look, there's no bomb.

06:56.292 --> 06:59.083
Remember what I said about
other ways of slowing us down?

06:59.167 --> 07:01.292
Listen to me. Listen to me!

07:01.375 --> 07:02.542
There's no bomb.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.500
They're just putting that idea
into your head.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.458
There's a bomb
on the other side of that door.

07:06.542 --> 07:08.000
I know it, chief!
I'm tellin' you!

07:08.083 --> 07:10.625
Alright! Alright.

07:10.708 --> 07:12.208
Look, we can't have him
working a cutting torch

07:12.292 --> 07:14.000
while he's unstable.
It's okay. It's alright.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.917
- Come on. Get him out of here.
- You've got to believe me.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.625
You've gotta listen to me.

07:17.708 --> 07:20.000
Wait, wait, wait.
How many others?

07:20.083 --> 07:22.458
Oh, about a dozen, maybe more.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.167
It takes about a half an hour
to get somebody down here.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.333
Each one burns through
a little bit, then flips out.

07:27.417 --> 07:29.625
Then we gotta wait around
till we bring somebody else in.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.125
By the time we finally
do burn through

07:31.208 --> 07:33.000
they got three-inch plating
on the other side

07:33.083 --> 07:35.333
and we either gotta start the
whole damn thing all over again

07:35.417 --> 07:37.958
or move on and hope we get
through someplace else

07:38.042 --> 07:39.167
before they find us.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.875
But a single telepath

07:40.958 --> 07:43.417
would have to be on
a direct sight line to do that.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.458
That's right.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.833
So there has to be
a whole lot of 'em

07:49.917 --> 07:52.542
just on the other side of this.

08:06.792 --> 08:09.625
Is there any other way in?

08:09.708 --> 08:12.125
Well, nothing safe.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.667
Meaning?

08:13.750 --> 08:15.167
Well..

08:15.250 --> 08:17.708
...we've got maintenance ducts
all through here

08:17.792 --> 08:19.542
but they're pretty fragile

08:19.625 --> 08:22.167
too thin for a lot of guys in
flack jackets and fully armed..

08:22.250 --> 08:24.458
Captain..

08:24.542 --> 08:27.083
...like I was saying..

08:27.167 --> 08:29.083
...even if they could
handle the weight

08:29.167 --> 08:31.375
only one person
can crawl through at a time

08:31.458 --> 08:33.042
especially at the end

08:33.125 --> 08:35.958
and then they're fully
vulnerable and exposed.

08:36.042 --> 08:37.875
Nobody can help you
if you get into trouble.

08:37.958 --> 08:40.500
- Find me one.
- Captain..

08:40.583 --> 08:42.250
- I'm going in.
- I object.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.500
Objection noted, Mr. Allan.

08:44.583 --> 08:47.875
Find me a way in, and I will
find my own way back out.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.875
[sighs]

08:54.042 --> 08:56.417
- Was she there this time?
- She was.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.375
- Did she get the message?
- I don't know.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.167
It was all we could do
just to send it.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.625
So much metal in the way.

09:03.708 --> 09:05.542
We'll have to see.

09:07.583 --> 09:10.625
[dramatic music]

09:16.458 --> 09:18.500
I don't understand it.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.625
- Hm?
- These reports.

09:22.708 --> 09:24.875
When we are at peace,
we cut production

09:24.958 --> 09:27.750
on ships and weapons 25%

09:27.833 --> 09:30.125
and invest that money
in domestic economy.

09:30.208 --> 09:32.417
Manufacturing,
research and development.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.125
Sensible, wise.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.500
Who thought it up for you?

09:35.583 --> 09:39.250
Right now, even though we are
not at war with anyone

09:39.333 --> 09:43.625
our production of war material
has increased 15%.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.833
Why?

09:45.917 --> 09:47.833
(G'Kar)
'Well, with everyone
now on the same side'

09:47.917 --> 09:51.250
'perhaps you're planning to
invade yourselves for a change.'

09:51.333 --> 09:53.833
I find the idea
curiously appealing.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.708
Once you've finished
killing each other

09:55.792 --> 09:57.667
we can plow under
all the buildings

09:57.750 --> 10:00.667
and plant rows of flowers
that spell out the words

10:00.750 --> 10:02.958
"Too annoying to live."

10:03.042 --> 10:06.792
In letters big enough
to be seen from space.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.000
Would you like some spoo?
It's fresh.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.375
Fah! Get that away from me.

10:11.458 --> 10:12.833
Spoo needs to age.

10:12.917 --> 10:16.250
It takes time
to-to cultivate its flavor.

10:16.333 --> 10:19.250
To eat fresh spoo
is to insult a Centauri.

10:19.333 --> 10:20.833
I don't even know
where you got it.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.708
I saw it on a tray heading into
the south end of the palace.

10:23.792 --> 10:25.583
I assumed no one would mind
if I took it.

10:25.667 --> 10:29.375
That's right.
Only Narns can stomach it fresh.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.875
Well, if that's true, and I'm
the only Narn in the palace

10:31.958 --> 10:33.875
then where was it going?

10:39.333 --> 10:42.375
[dramatic music]

10:43.208 --> 10:45.375
Mollari..

10:45.458 --> 10:47.000
...where was it going?

10:47.083 --> 10:50.458
How do I know?
Do I look like a chef to you?

10:50.542 --> 10:53.167
What's in the south end
of the palace?

10:55.458 --> 10:57.000
Well, uh..

10:57.083 --> 11:00.708
...the memorial gardens,
the, the old living quarters.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.958
Mostly shut down now,
have been for years

11:03.042 --> 11:04.750
and, uh..

11:06.833 --> 11:09.458
...and the underground cells.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.792
- Take me there.
- 'It's late.'

11:13.875 --> 11:15.333
Now.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.833
Hello?

11:25.917 --> 11:27.958
[chains clink]

11:30.500 --> 11:32.583
Is there someone here?

11:35.417 --> 11:37.458
[clinking]

11:41.375 --> 11:42.625
Na'Toth?

11:42.708 --> 11:44.750
[sobbing]

11:51.417 --> 11:53.500
What're you doing here?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.958
Did they get you as well?

11:58.042 --> 12:00.292
Get? Oh, no.

12:00.375 --> 12:03.083
No. The war is over, Na'Toth.

12:08.542 --> 12:10.417
Did we win?

12:11.542 --> 12:14.583
Narn is free, Na'Toth.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.750
We stand now as one
among equals.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.625
- Yes.
- When did you get here?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.458
I thought you were dead.

12:23.542 --> 12:27.000
We all thought you died on the
first wave of attacks on Narn.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.542
Almost.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.458
We had no warning.

12:33.542 --> 12:35.583
We saw nothing

12:35.667 --> 12:37.167
heard nothing

12:37.250 --> 12:40.375
until a second star
appeared in the morning sky

12:40.458 --> 12:42.875
and then the sky exploded.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.333
Five million Narn killed
in the first few minutes

12:48.417 --> 12:50.542
of the attack.

12:50.625 --> 12:54.208
There are no words, G'Kar.

12:54.292 --> 12:57.792
It was as if the universe
itself had turned against us

12:57.875 --> 13:00.167
and said, die..

13:00.250 --> 13:02.583
'...die..'

13:02.667 --> 13:04.375
'...die.'

13:07.042 --> 13:10.792
I awoke...in the ruins
of the capital.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.708
A Centauri boot
was on my throat.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.250
I tried to bite him.

13:21.458 --> 13:23.667
It's the last thing I remember

13:23.750 --> 13:26.333
before I awoke
on the ship coming here.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.375
They wanted us as trophies
of their victory

13:31.458 --> 13:33.958
as slave labor..

13:34.042 --> 13:36.583
...and as entertainment.

13:39.625 --> 13:43.167
They put me here because I was
not sufficiently entertaining.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.500
But that was..

13:48.625 --> 13:51.250
...over two years ago.

13:53.417 --> 13:56.500
She was my aide, Mollari.

13:58.167 --> 14:01.458
And my friend.
You knew her.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.750
You spoke to her.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.833
What is she
still doing here?

14:05.917 --> 14:08.000
I have no idea.

14:11.833 --> 14:14.167
She was probably just forgotten.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.000
Forgotten?

14:16.917 --> 14:19.750
You put her in this cell

14:19.833 --> 14:21.750
you chain her to the wall

14:21.833 --> 14:24.125
and then simply forgot
that she was here?

14:24.208 --> 14:26.333
I didn't do anything, G'Kar!

14:26.417 --> 14:28.375
I didn't know she was here!

14:28.458 --> 14:30.000
I would've been back
on Babylon 5

14:30.083 --> 14:31.250
when she was brought here.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.583
Then why is she still here?

14:33.667 --> 14:36.375
The war is over.
Why is she still here?

14:36.458 --> 14:39.625
Probably because
the emperor gave the order.

14:39.708 --> 14:42.000
After that, I doubt
he gave it very much thought

14:42.083 --> 14:45.708
and thus forgot
to countermand the order.

14:45.792 --> 14:49.375
These things happen
in a monarchy.

14:51.125 --> 14:53.542
When I was still new
to the royal palace

14:53.625 --> 14:55.625
I looked out the window

14:55.708 --> 14:59.250
and saw a guard standing
in the middle of a courtyard.

14:59.333 --> 15:03.458
Nothing to protect,
nothing to guard, no doors.

15:03.542 --> 15:07.167
I couldn't figure out
what he was guarding

15:07.250 --> 15:08.375
and so I asked around.

15:08.458 --> 15:12.417
No one knew,
not even the emperor.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.750
Finally, they-they searched
through the old records

15:15.833 --> 15:17.458
and found the truth.

15:17.542 --> 15:20.417
That 200 years before

15:20.500 --> 15:22.708
as winter came to an end

15:22.792 --> 15:26.458
the emperor's daughter
saw the first flower

15:26.542 --> 15:29.833
growing up through the snow.

15:29.917 --> 15:32.250
To keep anyone
from walking on it

15:32.333 --> 15:36.750
she assigned the guard to stand
watch over it every day.

15:36.833 --> 15:38.917
After that, she never
gave it much thought

15:39.000 --> 15:41.750
and, thus, never
countermanded the order.

15:43.708 --> 15:49.333
As a result
every day for 200 years

15:49.417 --> 15:52.375
a guard would stand
in that place..

15:53.917 --> 15:56.167
...long after
the flower was gone.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.292
Long after the reason
had been forgotten.

16:01.625 --> 16:04.083
Long after
the princess was gone.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.542
As I said, G'Kar..

16:10.125 --> 16:12.208
...these things happen.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.458
'They just happen.'

16:18.125 --> 16:20.208
It was a mistake.

16:20.292 --> 16:23.083
And now we are going to correct

16:23.167 --> 16:25.083
this mistake.

16:26.542 --> 16:29.042
Order her release at once.

16:29.125 --> 16:30.250
No, I can't do that.

16:30.333 --> 16:33.667
Don't you tell me
you can't do that.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.167
You're prime minister.

16:35.250 --> 16:39.167
The prime minister
cannot issue an order

16:39.250 --> 16:41.583
countermanding
the word of the emperor.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.250
That would be treason,
punishable by death.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.458
Only the regent can do that

16:46.542 --> 16:49.542
and I don't think that we can
count on his support.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.833
Later, when I become emperor--

16:53.917 --> 16:55.750
Too long.

16:55.833 --> 16:58.083
She could be dead by then.

17:00.958 --> 17:02.708
Then there is nothing I can do.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.833
There's something you can do.

17:04.917 --> 17:07.958
You will find it,
and you will do it!

17:10.292 --> 17:14.583
One way or another,
we will leave here with Na'Toth

17:15.500 --> 17:18.083
or by G'Quan, I swear

17:18.167 --> 17:20.750
I'll see this palace in flames.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.583
And I'll see you burn with it!

17:24.542 --> 17:26.917
I got your message.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.292
- That it?
- Yeah.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.000
This will lead you into Brown 12

17:30.083 --> 17:32.625
if they don't have the other end
walled up already.

17:32.708 --> 17:34.125
It's pretty tight in there.

17:34.208 --> 17:36.125
So if it is closed up, you won't
be able to turn around.

17:36.208 --> 17:39.125
You'll have to crawl out
backwards the whole way.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.292
[sighs]
Alright.

17:41.375 --> 17:43.000
I'm goin' in.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.042
Give me one hour,
if I'm not back by then

17:45.125 --> 17:46.542
go ahead and seal up
this side of it

17:46.625 --> 17:49.792
and keep trying
to cut through someplace else.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.333
Thanks, I've sent for help,
but they won't be here

17:52.417 --> 17:54.292
for at least another day
or two at the earliest.

17:54.375 --> 17:57.292
You got a flashlight? Thanks.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.792
All the information's
on my desk

17:58.875 --> 18:00.125
in case something goes wrong.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.667
Captain..

18:03.042 --> 18:04.833
...I think you'd better..

18:04.917 --> 18:07.500
There's a hell of a lot more
of them than me, Zack.

18:07.583 --> 18:10.250
If they mean to hurt me
that's not gonna help.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.167
Alright.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.375
See you on the flip side.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.000
(John)
'She went where?'

18:36.083 --> 18:37.167
(Michael)
'Right down the shaft'

18:37.250 --> 18:39.833
'right smack
in the middle of them.'

18:39.917 --> 18:41.333
Zack just gave me the news.

18:41.417 --> 18:43.250
Well, you've got to give
it to her. She's got guts.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.667
She is crazy.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.042
She was crazy when I knew
her almost 20 years ago.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.792
And she's just as crazy now.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.625
- You hired her.
- Don't remind me.

18:53.167 --> 18:54.958
You know, the thing is..

18:55.042 --> 18:57.167
...these guys
aren't the problem.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.375
I mean, if they got out

18:58.458 --> 19:00.875
we'd arrest them
and throw 'em in a cell.

19:00.958 --> 19:02.083
But they're in a cell anyway.

19:02.167 --> 19:03.833
They just made it
for themselves.

19:03.917 --> 19:06.583
Sooner or later, they're gonna
have to surrender or starve

19:06.667 --> 19:08.708
and then we can
get at them then.

19:08.792 --> 19:12.042
So, as far as I'm concerned
they're not an issue.

19:12.125 --> 19:15.375
It's the ones who got out
that I'm worried about.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.750
You think they might
resort to sabotage?

19:17.833 --> 19:20.042
- Possibility.
- Oh.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.458
Alright, alright,
I will talk to her

19:23.542 --> 19:26.208
when and if she gets back.

19:26.292 --> 19:29.083
- Anything else?
- Yeah. One thing.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.292
A Drazi security patrol
found this at the sight

19:33.375 --> 19:36.125
of the most recent attack
on the Drazi shipping lines.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.417
This is Brakiri metal.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.667
Looks like it was blown off
during the fight.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.250
Brakiri?

19:42.333 --> 19:44.125
They're not the type
to go around

19:44.208 --> 19:46.250
attacking other races
without provocation.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.333
There are probably
two dozen dead Drazi

19:48.417 --> 19:51.375
that would disagree with that
assessment right about now.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.875
The Drazi plan
on introducing this

19:52.958 --> 19:54.708
at the next council
meeting tomorrow morning.

19:54.792 --> 19:57.125
As a courtesy,
they wanted you to know.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.750
Better lay on extra security.

19:59.833 --> 20:03.125
I have a hunch there's gonna
be trouble once this gets out.

20:03.208 --> 20:05.125
I don't doubt it.

20:07.042 --> 20:09.542
I don't get it, Michael.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.958
I truly don't.

20:12.042 --> 20:14.000
I mean, after a while..

20:14.083 --> 20:16.833
...you'd think this
would get a little easier?

20:16.917 --> 20:18.708
But, lately..

20:18.792 --> 20:20.458
...it feels like
it's all falling apart.

20:20.542 --> 20:23.708
Everything is-is
fraying at the edges.

20:26.542 --> 20:29.708
I mean, instead of everybody
trying to hold things together

20:29.792 --> 20:32.208
I feel like they're-they're
all grabbing at threads

20:32.292 --> 20:35.417
and been pulling in a hundred
different directions.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.042
Do you really
want an answer to that?

20:39.875 --> 20:41.750
You got one?

20:43.042 --> 20:45.167
Yeah.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.125
Why is it that we always
break up our history

20:47.208 --> 20:51.458
by the, the wars
not the years of peace?

20:51.542 --> 20:53.333
The Hundred Years' War

20:53.417 --> 20:56.542
...War of 1812,
the first three World Wars

20:56.625 --> 20:59.375
the Dilgar war,
the War of the Shining Star

20:59.458 --> 21:01.333
the Minbari war,
the Shadow war.

21:01.417 --> 21:04.167
Why the war,
but not the peace?

21:06.083 --> 21:07.833
Because it's exciting.

21:07.917 --> 21:10.167
And, because, on some level
people like to see something big

21:10.250 --> 21:13.500
fall apart and explode
from the inside out.

21:13.583 --> 21:17.375
And right now, John,
we're that something.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.417
[breathing heavily]

21:37.167 --> 21:39.208
[grunting]

21:45.333 --> 21:47.417
[breathing heavily]

21:49.083 --> 21:50.958
Take me to him.

21:59.417 --> 22:00.833
Hello, captain.

22:00.917 --> 22:03.833
I regret that we should meet
again under these circumstances.

22:03.917 --> 22:06.792
Well, that makes two of us.
Hello, Lyta.

22:06.875 --> 22:09.125
Captain, glad you could make it.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.833
I had a sense
that it might be safe.

22:11.917 --> 22:16.417
'Course, I could've been wrong
but it was worth the risk.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.750
I don't know how much
you've been

22:17.833 --> 22:19.333
following the news topside--

22:19.417 --> 22:21.083
We hear very little.

22:21.167 --> 22:23.875
Well, you've walked into
the middle of a firestorm.

22:23.958 --> 22:25.833
Somebody's been attacking
the shipping lines

22:25.917 --> 22:27.250
of many of the alliance worlds.

22:27.333 --> 22:30.500
And they're looking
for someone to lash out at.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.750
'When you threatened
to reveal their secrets'

22:32.833 --> 22:35.750
'you got the full benefit
of their paranoia.'

22:35.833 --> 22:37.875
Any chance you might've had
to get a homeworld

22:37.958 --> 22:41.292
for your people,
it's pretty much shot to hell.

22:41.375 --> 22:44.083
From where I sit that renders
this standoff meaningless.

22:44.167 --> 22:48.000
With respect, captain, that's
not your decision to make.

22:48.083 --> 22:51.417
Listen to me, if you care
about your people

22:51.500 --> 22:54.417
you have to come out
and come out now.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.875
If we have to come in after you

22:55.958 --> 22:58.625
someone's gonna
get hurt, or killed.

22:58.708 --> 23:00.875
I'd rather avoid that if I can.

23:00.958 --> 23:03.667
So would I
but we're not leaving.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.167
[sighs]

23:05.250 --> 23:08.208
Then at least help us
to identify your people

23:08.292 --> 23:09.792
who are still
operating outside.

23:09.875 --> 23:12.083
That would, that would help
put their minds at ease.

23:12.167 --> 23:14.625
We don't betray our own kind.

23:14.708 --> 23:16.083
We will stay here
as long as it takes

23:16.167 --> 23:18.333
to communicate our message.

23:18.417 --> 23:21.000
We were created
to serve normals

23:21.083 --> 23:22.458
and now that
the Shadow war is over

23:22.542 --> 23:25.250
we deserve compensation, a home.

23:25.333 --> 23:26.708
Won't happen.

23:26.792 --> 23:28.792
They'll see you dead first.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.458
Then we will die.

23:30.542 --> 23:32.958
Maybe you're willing to die..

23:33.042 --> 23:35.583
...but what about
the rest of you?

23:35.667 --> 23:38.250
Anyone who wants to come
with me can do so.

23:38.333 --> 23:42.000
I'll bring you out
give you whatever help I can.

23:43.417 --> 23:45.708
This may be your last chance.

23:48.292 --> 23:50.333
[intense music]

23:51.750 --> 23:52.875
There's nothing you can say

23:52.958 --> 23:55.333
that will make
them leave, captain.

23:55.417 --> 23:57.792
Then why did you
let me come here?

23:57.875 --> 24:00.250
Why did you agree to see me?

24:02.042 --> 24:04.292
To say good-bye.

24:04.375 --> 24:07.833
While you have not gone out
of your way to be kind to us

24:07.917 --> 24:11.167
you have been fair,
and that requires comment..

24:12.375 --> 24:13.667
...especially since
I have the feeling that

24:13.750 --> 24:16.417
this is the last time
we will see one another.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.917
[intense music]

24:29.042 --> 24:32.333
Well...did you
get through to Narn?

24:32.417 --> 24:35.167
Yes, they can have a ship
standing by to intercept us

24:35.250 --> 24:37.875
midway to Babylon 5,
then take her home.

24:37.958 --> 24:39.333
Yes, well, the hard part

24:39.417 --> 24:41.333
is still getting Na'Toth
out of the palace

24:41.417 --> 24:43.125
and onto our ship first.

24:43.208 --> 24:45.208
And we have to do it
without killing a guard

24:45.292 --> 24:47.958
without raising any alarms
and without anyone noticing

24:48.042 --> 24:50.042
that she is gone.

24:50.125 --> 24:53.042
[sighs]
For my next trick
I shall fly around the room

24:53.125 --> 24:55.542
under my own power.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.042
Yes?

25:02.417 --> 25:04.083
- Prime minister?
- Yes?

25:04.167 --> 25:06.292
I was told to inform you
that the next cruiser

25:06.375 --> 25:08.958
bound for Babylon 5
will be leaving tonight.

25:09.042 --> 25:11.208
Yes. Alright. Thank you.

25:13.958 --> 25:15.750
Wait a minute.

25:15.833 --> 25:17.667
Close the door.

25:19.125 --> 25:21.125
'Let me look at you.'

25:25.958 --> 25:28.000
Turn round.

25:29.083 --> 25:30.750
'Yes. Yes.'

25:30.833 --> 25:32.750
Very nice.

25:32.833 --> 25:35.625
I think you may be just
what I am looking for.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.917
Would you mind
taking off your clothes?

25:38.000 --> 25:39.208
Mollari!

25:39.292 --> 25:40.750
Not necessarily at this moment

25:40.833 --> 25:43.542
and certainly not
in front of the, um..

25:49.542 --> 25:51.292
[clears throat]

25:52.583 --> 25:56.917
Oh, it's animal magnetism.
What can I say?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.542
What would you
like to do now..

26:01.625 --> 26:04.292
...prime minister?

26:04.375 --> 26:06.667
Borrow your clothes for a while.

26:06.750 --> 26:08.792
Ahh, of course.

26:08.875 --> 26:12.375
Emperor Cartagia also played
this game with me

26:12.458 --> 26:16.375
but...I'm not your size,
prime minister.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.500
Oh, I'll make do.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.708
[droning]

26:23.792 --> 26:26.667
As you all know, there
have been further attacks

26:26.750 --> 26:28.833
on ships
from all the member worlds.

26:28.917 --> 26:31.000
We have called this closed
session together because

26:31.083 --> 26:34.250
the Drazi ambassador has asked
to speak to you about this.

26:34.333 --> 26:36.042
Ambassador?

26:37.958 --> 26:41.167
This piece of debris
was found at the sight

26:41.250 --> 26:45.125
of one of the most recent
attacks against our ships.

26:45.208 --> 26:47.167
Our scientists have analyzed it

26:47.250 --> 26:50.250
and found it to be
of Brakiri origin.

26:50.333 --> 26:52.417
What? This is an outrage.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.750
We believe that the Brakiri
have been using the telepaths

26:55.833 --> 26:58.000
who spied on us to get
information

26:58.083 --> 27:01.167
about our shipping lines
and our defense systems.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.000
We believe that they
are working with us

27:03.083 --> 27:05.333
only so they can steal from us.

27:05.417 --> 27:06.375
That is a lie!

27:06.458 --> 27:08.083
Well, the Brakiri are pack rats!

27:08.167 --> 27:10.750
Everybody knows that.
You invent nothing.

27:10.833 --> 27:12.583
You only take from others.

27:12.667 --> 27:15.125
Today, we have
dispatched warships

27:15.208 --> 27:17.250
to the border
of Brakiri space.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.958
For every one of our ships
that is intercepted

27:20.042 --> 27:23.542
and destroyed we will destroy
one of their ships.

27:23.625 --> 27:27.333
- Then you declare war on us.
- We are defending ourselves!

27:27.417 --> 27:29.250
Before you answer that,
ambassador

27:29.333 --> 27:32.083
I believe the Gaim Ambassador
also wanted to speak.

27:34.292 --> 27:36.750
We too have found debris
from an attacking ship

27:36.833 --> 27:38.917
in the ruins
of one of our vessels.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.708
We too have analyzed it.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.708
And was that debris
of Brakiri origin?

27:43.792 --> 27:46.333
No, it was made by Drazi.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.375
So you try to blame us.

27:49.458 --> 27:50.958
You try to get others
to attack us

27:51.042 --> 27:53.125
to create a diversion
to conceal the truth

27:53.208 --> 27:55.083
that you're
responsible all along!

27:55.167 --> 27:57.917
No! This is a trick!

27:58.000 --> 28:00.833
That's exactly what
I think it is, a trick.

28:00.917 --> 28:04.667
You find pieces of their ships.
They find pieces of your ships.

28:06.667 --> 28:09.083
Someone is hitting your people

28:09.167 --> 28:13.250
and leaving material they hope
will implicate the rest of you.

28:13.333 --> 28:16.042
Someone is trying
to divide the alliance

28:16.125 --> 28:19.000
sow distrust, make you lash out
at each other.

28:20.333 --> 28:23.250
I had Mr. Garibaldi
do a complete examination

28:23.333 --> 28:25.125
of those two pieces.

28:25.208 --> 28:27.458
They weren't
blown off a ship.

28:27.542 --> 28:29.375
They were cut off.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.875
The edges are too smooth.

28:32.958 --> 28:36.125
They planted them where
they knew you would find them

28:36.208 --> 28:38.167
hoping for exactly
this reaction.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.417
- But who would do that?
- I don't know.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.542
But I do know that blaming
each other right now

28:43.625 --> 28:45.625
is the worst thing
that we could do.

28:45.708 --> 28:47.875
Together we can
figure this out

28:47.958 --> 28:49.917
but if we start
fighting each other

28:50.000 --> 28:52.792
there won't be enough pieces
left to work it out.

28:52.875 --> 28:56.125
We ask you to give us
just a little more time.

28:56.208 --> 28:58.167
We are gathering as much
information as we can

28:58.250 --> 29:01.750
as fast as we can,
but it still takes time.

29:01.833 --> 29:04.792
Any ship that crosses
Drazi space

29:04.875 --> 29:06.958
without proper authorization

29:07.042 --> 29:09.458
will not survive the mistake.

29:09.542 --> 29:12.625
[instrumental music]

29:28.208 --> 29:30.542
Yes, good,
she is still here.

29:31.333 --> 29:33.458
I have new orders for you

29:33.542 --> 29:36.292
and they're to be
followed precisely.

29:36.375 --> 29:39.208
Are there any other
occupied cells in this wing?

29:39.292 --> 29:41.542
No, excellency.
This is the only one.

29:41.625 --> 29:42.958
Good.

29:43.042 --> 29:46.833
You will retire from this cell.
Never come back.

29:46.917 --> 29:49.417
And never allow
anyone else to come back.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.500
(male #2)
'What about her food and water?'

29:51.583 --> 29:54.042
(Londo)
'She will not need either.'

29:54.125 --> 29:56.375
'Do I make myself clear?'

29:58.125 --> 29:59.667
And wait three days.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.167
Wall up the hallway

30:01.250 --> 30:04.083
so no one will find
what is left of her.

30:04.167 --> 30:06.292
Do you understand?

30:06.375 --> 30:10.208
Will you follow my plan
precisely without variation?

30:10.292 --> 30:12.917
- Yes, excellency.
- Good.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.792
Go now.

30:19.708 --> 30:22.083
Have you come
to kill me, Mollari?

30:22.167 --> 30:23.583
No.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.792
Pity.

30:28.875 --> 30:32.042
For I will kill you at the very
first opportunity.

30:32.125 --> 30:37.208
Yes, I suspect you have to get
in line for that honor.

30:37.292 --> 30:39.750
Ah, good, G'Kar, were you seen?

30:39.833 --> 30:40.917
I don't think so.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.667
Help me.
We don't have much time.

30:48.333 --> 30:51.208
(male announcer)
'Cargo Chief Robinson,
dock at bay 7..'

30:51.292 --> 30:53.333
- Captain.
- Bester.

30:53.417 --> 30:55.583
So good to see you again.

30:55.667 --> 30:59.083
I told you they were trouble.
You wouldn't listen.

30:59.167 --> 31:03.292
But that's alright.
I'm used to it.

31:03.375 --> 31:05.583
I'm here now.

31:05.667 --> 31:07.833
It's all gonna be just fine.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.250
G'Kar, we must hurry!

31:13.333 --> 31:15.625
The ship leaves
within the hour.

31:20.083 --> 31:21.792
Well..

31:23.375 --> 31:24.917
It, uh..

31:26.250 --> 31:28.417
...it will have to do.

31:29.750 --> 31:31.083
Can she make it?

31:31.167 --> 31:32.792
The landing bay
is some distance away.

31:32.875 --> 31:35.125
She is strong of will
if nothing else.

31:35.208 --> 31:38.083
She can walk to the other side
of the planet if need be.

31:38.167 --> 31:40.875
Just the landing bay
will be fine.

31:41.542 --> 31:43.125
Come.

31:43.208 --> 31:44.875
How do we avoid
being noticed?

31:44.958 --> 31:47.792
We don't. We do everything
we can to be noticed.

31:47.875 --> 31:52.042
- And thus become invisible.
- I don't understand.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.000
The royal court
has been trained

31:54.083 --> 31:56.833
not to see what
is inappropriate.

31:56.917 --> 31:58.917
Now, we must hurry.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.042
Here, this will help.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.667
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.458
Neither can I.

32:06.542 --> 32:09.208
Alright, come.

32:09.292 --> 32:11.333
[laughing]

32:13.750 --> 32:15.208
[continues laughing]

32:15.292 --> 32:17.208
Diamonds!

32:17.292 --> 32:20.750
As many diamonds as you like,
my good woman.

32:20.833 --> 32:22.542
Oh, the things I will show you

32:22.625 --> 32:26.750
the things we will do
with one another.

32:26.833 --> 32:29.292
The world is ours. Yes!

32:29.375 --> 32:32.083
The world is ours, my dear.

32:32.167 --> 32:36.917
You, you, don't you agree
that the world is ours?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.250
[laughing]
It is ours.

32:39.333 --> 32:43.000
Oh, yes, yes, my dear.

32:43.083 --> 32:44.417
'And when we are alone..'

32:44.500 --> 32:45.833
Oh, no,
don't turn away from me.

32:45.917 --> 32:49.375
It will be wonderful,
a paradise of passion

32:49.458 --> 32:50.917
just the two of us.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.250
Oh, great maker, I will be glad
to be back on Babylon 5

32:54.333 --> 32:56.417
where at least
it will be quiet. Oh. Yes.

32:56.500 --> 33:00.500
Day will turn into night
and night will turn into day

33:00.583 --> 33:03.542
and still our thirst for passion
will not be quenched.

33:07.833 --> 33:10.125
- Thomas, he's here.
- Who?

33:10.208 --> 33:13.250
Bester. One of the others saw
him pass through customs.

33:14.458 --> 33:15.750
If he's here,
then the bloodhound units

33:15.833 --> 33:17.042
can't be far behind.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.167
And this time,
the captain won't help us.

33:19.250 --> 33:22.333
What do we do?
We can't let them take Byron.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.333
And we can't be captured
by Psi-Corps.

33:24.417 --> 33:27.333
I won't go back there.
I'd die first.

33:27.417 --> 33:30.583
There is another alternative.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.375
We can fight back.

33:32.458 --> 33:35.250
- But Byron said--
- Byron is trapped.

33:35.333 --> 33:36.542
He can't even help himself.

33:36.625 --> 33:38.500
We have to do for ourselves now

33:38.583 --> 33:40.958
for our own good
and for his.

33:41.042 --> 33:43.083
We may be his only hope

33:43.167 --> 33:46.625
and the only hope
of our kind.

33:46.708 --> 33:49.583
I know where there are weapons.
Come on.

33:53.792 --> 33:55.875
I take it this is the place.

33:59.917 --> 34:02.333
I've seen this trick before.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.958
They can hold your
people off for days, weeks.

34:06.042 --> 34:09.500
- Even longer.
- Fine by me.

34:09.583 --> 34:11.792
I keep telling
there's a bomb in there

34:11.875 --> 34:13.542
but they won't listen.

34:13.625 --> 34:14.750
There's no bomb.

34:14.833 --> 34:17.292
Oh, but when-when I..

34:20.333 --> 34:23.542
There's...no..

34:23.625 --> 34:25.292
...bomb.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.125
Now..

34:30.208 --> 34:33.292
...go on.
I'll go with you.

34:38.333 --> 34:40.292
Put your hand on the wall.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.542
[intense music]

35:01.917 --> 35:03.667
I'm blocking them.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.833
You can go back to work.

35:05.917 --> 35:07.792
It's safe.

35:21.375 --> 35:23.375
[grunting]

35:24.625 --> 35:27.667
[dramatic music]

35:30.292 --> 35:33.083
Take us to the armory or die.

35:38.750 --> 35:41.417
- Ohh!
- The combination.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.792
What is the combination?

35:43.875 --> 35:46.083
No.

35:46.167 --> 35:47.667
Yes.

35:47.750 --> 35:50.333
Twelve..

35:50.417 --> 35:52.042
...sixteen

35:52.125 --> 35:53.458
forty two.

35:53.542 --> 35:57.292
- No!
- Nineteen.

35:57.375 --> 35:59.792
Thirty seven.

35:59.875 --> 36:01.250
And..

36:01.333 --> 36:03.292
...ah, two.

36:04.417 --> 36:08.042
And a hand print
for verification.

36:08.125 --> 36:10.583
I think we can arrange that.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.583
I assume, captain,
that this time

36:14.667 --> 36:17.417
you'll let me take custody
of the blips.

36:17.500 --> 36:21.583
[sighs]
If you can get them
out safely, they're yours.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.958
I'll do whatever I can
not to hurt them.

36:24.042 --> 36:26.125
You forget,
we're more the same

36:26.208 --> 36:27.625
than we are different.

36:27.708 --> 36:31.083
We're all telepaths,
and we're all in this together.

36:32.917 --> 36:34.958
[grunting]

36:37.000 --> 36:39.708
Get down! Watch it!

36:45.833 --> 36:47.375
'Get down!'

36:47.458 --> 36:50.125
- Zack!
- Behind you, behind you.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.292
[zapping]

36:53.375 --> 36:55.500
'Go!'

36:55.583 --> 36:57.667
'Up there!'

36:57.750 --> 36:59.583
[dramatic music]

36:59.667 --> 37:01.708
'One more down!'

37:03.208 --> 37:05.292
[indistinct shouting]

37:08.375 --> 37:10.500
Stop! No!

37:14.750 --> 37:16.917
He's still breathing.
Medlab!

37:17.000 --> 37:18.292
Medlab, this is security.

37:18.375 --> 37:21.250
I need a trauma team
in Brown 9, ASAP.

37:23.083 --> 37:25.292
[breathing heavily]

37:25.375 --> 37:27.250
This one's dead.

37:28.375 --> 37:29.792
So is he.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.792
Bester?

37:31.875 --> 37:32.917
Fine.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.333
A little depressed
about the inflation rate

37:35.417 --> 37:36.833
and hemlines are
going down again

37:36.917 --> 37:38.083
but otherwise--

37:38.167 --> 37:39.583
Shut up!

37:39.667 --> 37:41.708
What the hell
is wrong with you?

37:41.792 --> 37:43.917
We got two people dead here.

37:45.250 --> 37:47.458
Two of your people.

37:47.542 --> 37:49.667
They're not my people.

37:49.750 --> 37:51.333
My people are in there.

37:51.417 --> 37:53.417
And several others
just tried to kill me.

37:53.500 --> 37:58.042
But then what family
doesn't have its difficulties?

37:58.125 --> 38:00.167
I'll attend to them..

38:01.250 --> 38:03.833
...and leave you
to attend to yours.

38:07.958 --> 38:11.042
[instrumental music]

38:23.750 --> 38:25.458
- 'Byron'
- I know.

38:25.542 --> 38:27.708
I know, it's started.

38:27.792 --> 38:29.375
I didn't want this to happen,
Lyta.

38:29.458 --> 38:32.167
- I know.
- They're killing in my name.

38:32.250 --> 38:35.583
- I have to stop it.
- There's nothing you can do.

38:36.833 --> 38:38.875
Yes.

38:38.958 --> 38:40.833
Yes, there is.

38:54.292 --> 38:56.208
Good. Thank you.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.000
Thank you for coming.

38:58.083 --> 39:00.792
We thought we might continue
our discussion in private.

39:00.875 --> 39:02.917
There is nothing left
to discuss.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.667
Well, we think there is.

39:04.750 --> 39:07.083
If you'll watch
the monitor, please.

39:09.375 --> 39:11.583
Do you recognize those,
ambassador?

39:11.667 --> 39:14.583
Yes, those are the ships
we dispatched to our border

39:14.667 --> 39:16.083
to watch the Brakiri.

39:16.167 --> 39:20.042
And to attack if your shipping
lines are victimized again.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.583
Yes.

39:28.292 --> 39:31.083
Those are our ships, ambassador.

39:31.167 --> 39:34.458
Our ships watching your ships
watching their ships.

39:34.542 --> 39:37.417
If you attack them,
our ships will attack you.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.833
The same applies
to the Gaim and the Brakiri.

39:39.917 --> 39:41.042
On what grounds?

39:41.125 --> 39:43.500
This is a violation
of our sovereign rights.

39:43.583 --> 39:45.458
No, it's not.

39:45.542 --> 39:46.958
Read the constitution.

39:47.042 --> 39:48.333
The moment you joined
the alliance

39:48.417 --> 39:50.208
you agreed that the alliance

39:50.292 --> 39:53.083
had jurisdiction
over disputes between members.

39:53.167 --> 39:55.042
One member race
cannot attack another

39:55.125 --> 39:56.833
without either
leaving the alliance

39:56.917 --> 39:59.083
or suffering retaliation

39:59.167 --> 40:01.542
we refuse to allow
border disputes and skirmishes

40:01.625 --> 40:03.208
to tear us apart.

40:03.292 --> 40:06.125
What do you propose?

40:06.208 --> 40:08.292
Just give us some more time.

40:08.375 --> 40:10.917
There's a lot of speculation
but there is no direct evidence

40:11.000 --> 40:12.458
that anyone in the alliance

40:12.542 --> 40:14.750
is responsible
for these attacks.

40:14.833 --> 40:17.042
I will not condone
any military action

40:17.125 --> 40:18.625
by any member world

40:18.708 --> 40:20.708
without clear
and absolute proof.

40:20.792 --> 40:22.500
If you're content
to wait for that proof

40:22.583 --> 40:25.125
we will wait with you,
and once the truth is known

40:25.208 --> 40:27.583
we will support any action
you choose to take

40:27.667 --> 40:30.792
as part of an overall response
by the alliance.

40:30.875 --> 40:34.042
Move on your own
and you are alone.

40:34.125 --> 40:37.083
And you'll have
to take the consequences.

40:37.167 --> 40:40.500
This is not what our people
signed up for, Sheridan.

40:40.583 --> 40:42.167
No, I'm sure it isn't

40:42.250 --> 40:46.167
but then again,
we are saving your skin.

40:46.250 --> 40:48.208
For at least a little while.

40:50.375 --> 40:51.875
Well, ambassador?

40:51.958 --> 40:54.833
We will wait for a little while

40:54.917 --> 40:57.042
but we will not forget this.

40:57.125 --> 40:59.583
You have threatened
to use force against us

40:59.667 --> 41:03.833
when all we wanted
was to protect ourselves.

41:03.917 --> 41:08.000
Every great fall
begins with a single mistake.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.208
This was yours.

41:15.500 --> 41:18.583
[instrumental music]

41:27.292 --> 41:30.917
(Londo)
Do you think
she will be alright?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.417
I think so.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.625
But it will take
her spirit longer to heal

41:35.708 --> 41:37.625
than her body.

41:38.625 --> 41:41.875
I have endured your cells.

41:41.958 --> 41:44.083
It will be a long
and difficult climb

41:44.167 --> 41:46.708
back into the light.

41:46.792 --> 41:48.417
Perhaps.

41:50.292 --> 41:53.583
I will tell you
a true thing, G'Kar.

41:53.667 --> 41:56.792
Getting her out of there,
the danger..

41:58.542 --> 42:00.250
...I found it..

42:00.333 --> 42:03.208
[chuckling]

42:03.292 --> 42:05.542
...most exhilarating.

42:05.625 --> 42:08.125
I also have worked up
quite an appetite.

42:09.500 --> 42:11.208
I think I shall go get
something to eat.

42:11.292 --> 42:12.583
And you?

42:12.667 --> 42:14.750
I'm not hungry.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.500
[whizzing]

42:21.167 --> 42:23.042
Good-bye, Na'Toth.

42:28.625 --> 42:31.667
[intense music]

42:50.792 --> 42:52.792
I'm glad you could make it.

42:52.875 --> 42:54.792
Now, let's get to work.

42:56.875 --> 43:00.500
(Lochley)
Personal log, June 18, 2262.

43:00.583 --> 43:02.250
I don't think I've had
a good night's sleep

43:02.333 --> 43:05.583
since I got here.
And tonight's no exception.

43:07.875 --> 43:09.250
But I have to sleep.

43:09.333 --> 43:11.792
Tonight is the calm
before the storm

43:11.875 --> 43:15.625
and I may not get
another chance for some time.

43:15.708 --> 43:18.042
Tomorrow the storm comes.

43:18.125 --> 43:21.167
Tomorrow the killing begins.

43:21.250 --> 43:24.792
And God help me, I can't think
of any way to stop it.

43:28.125 --> 43:31.167
[intense music]

43:33.708 --> 43:36.083
[theme music]
