00:56.289 --> 00:59.390
I didn't think
I'd ever feel this way again.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.228
But everything's gonna be okay.

01:36.361 --> 01:38.530
I'm in every way
not ready for this.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.567
Two sprays of that.

02:11.463 --> 02:13.133
Wish me luck.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.334
Abby's gonna meet me
at the bus stop.

02:17.336 --> 02:19.506
Home by 3:30.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.540
Bye.

02:27.445 --> 02:28.946
So we have first together,

02:28.948 --> 02:31.381
then I go to science,
and you go to Spanish.

02:31.383 --> 02:35.719
Oh, my God, I think Chess
might be in your class.

02:35.721 --> 02:37.488
You have to sit next to him.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.322
You have to tell me
what girls he's talking to.

02:39.324 --> 02:41.326
Oh, hold on.

02:43.295 --> 02:45.465
Hey, over here.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.691
You never let anything
get to you.

03:47.693 --> 03:49.125
I mean...

03:49.127 --> 03:51.627
Echo?

03:51.629 --> 03:54.667
I just wanna say
how sorry I am about Zoe.

04:02.842 --> 04:05.778
You know, I can't imagine
how hard...

04:07.680 --> 04:09.015
I'm really sorry.

04:10.883 --> 04:12.885
Thanks, Parker.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.690
It'll wear off.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.526
Yeah. No, it won't.

04:22.528 --> 04:23.860
The first day of high school

04:23.862 --> 04:26.964
is the most freaking, awkward
day of your life.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.500
That's undisputed.

04:29.502 --> 04:31.769
There's awkward,
and then there's this.

04:31.771 --> 04:36.276
You just gotta let people
get used to the new normal.

04:38.009 --> 04:40.176
I don't think normal's
going to happen.

04:40.178 --> 04:42.512
Okay, that came out
completely wrong.

04:42.514 --> 04:47.985
I just meant that eventually
everybody's gonna move on.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.989
Yeah, no,
I know what you meant.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.158
I'm sure you're right.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.027
It's just so sad
and so awful.

04:58.029 --> 05:01.197
And nobody knows what to say.

05:01.199 --> 05:04.601
Yeah, I know, I know.

05:04.603 --> 05:07.471
Zoe was the most freakin'
perfect human being

05:07.473 --> 05:10.009
that has ever seemed to...

05:11.509 --> 05:14.144
Oh, my God, there he is.

05:14.146 --> 05:18.484
Have you talked to him?
I mean, since it happened?

05:20.685 --> 05:23.187
His mom put him in a facility.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.822
Suicide watch and everything.

05:25.824 --> 05:29.659
Full-on straightjacket,
padded walls.

05:29.661 --> 05:32.495
It's so, so sad.

05:32.497 --> 05:35.498
He was crazy about her.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.469
You know he torched
his own car, right?

05:38.471 --> 05:40.137
His Mustang?

05:40.139 --> 05:43.039
Like the day after
the police gave it back to him,

05:43.041 --> 05:45.242
soaked it in gasoline,
threw in a match.

05:45.244 --> 05:47.043
And why the hell not, right?

05:47.045 --> 05:50.514
I mean, it's not like
he can drive it anymore.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.716
Who's gonna buy it from him?

05:52.718 --> 05:55.985
Maybe some twisted
freak show.

05:55.987 --> 05:58.622
Marc! Oh, my God, Marc.

05:58.624 --> 06:00.223
Carley, come on.
Let's go to the bathroom.

06:00.225 --> 06:02.825
Marc, I knew it wasn't you.
I swear to God, okay?

06:02.827 --> 06:05.863
What'd you take, Carley?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.897
Carley, what'd you take?
What did she take?

06:07.899 --> 06:09.632
I have no idea,
honest to God.

06:09.634 --> 06:10.834
You should've heard
what all of these assholes

06:10.836 --> 06:11.901
were saying about you.

06:11.903 --> 06:14.872
I stuck up for you, okay?

06:14.874 --> 06:17.139
Come on, Carley.
The bell's gonna ring.

06:17.141 --> 06:19.077
The bell's gonna ring.

06:28.019 --> 06:29.788
Wow. That happened.

06:34.692 --> 06:35.794
Echo!

07:53.872 --> 07:57.341
Could you be
any more stupid?

07:57.343 --> 08:00.480
That guy didn't even
own a camera.

08:03.682 --> 08:05.848
You got what you wanted.

08:05.850 --> 08:07.086
You're famous.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.522
Congratulations.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.166
Hi, sweetie.

08:24.168 --> 08:25.702
You're up late.

08:25.704 --> 08:27.971
You too.

08:27.973 --> 08:29.839
Yeah.

08:29.841 --> 08:31.841
This new project's a bear.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.715
Where's your mom?

08:39.717 --> 08:40.885
She went to bed.

08:48.726 --> 08:50.960
How was she today?

08:50.962 --> 08:53.030
The zombie meds
are working great.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.864
Echo.

08:54.866 --> 08:57.569
She did eat some ramen.

09:00.405 --> 09:01.640
That's good.

09:03.107 --> 09:05.142
That's good.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.778
You got dinner?

09:07.779 --> 09:09.912
Yup.

09:17.755 --> 09:19.925
So what'd you do today?

09:22.326 --> 09:23.828
Started high school.

09:25.964 --> 09:27.998
Shit.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.932
Shoot, uh...

09:29.934 --> 09:33.036
I am sorry. I forgot.

09:33.038 --> 09:34.470
It's okay.

09:34.472 --> 09:38.307
High school, huh?

09:38.309 --> 09:40.679
That's a...
That's a big deal.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.716
Well, how'd it go?

09:48.086 --> 09:50.990
Was it good to see
your friends?

09:52.390 --> 09:53.892
Yeah.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.932
Is Marc back?

10:04.470 --> 10:06.706
He has a new car.

10:13.278 --> 10:16.412
My mom's stuck
at the lady doctor.

10:16.414 --> 10:19.150
She said
she's like half an hour.

10:20.451 --> 10:22.786
Do you wanna just walk?

10:22.788 --> 10:24.789
Fine.

10:29.394 --> 10:31.361
I would get something big,

10:31.363 --> 10:35.132
something cute and sporty
like a Fit or a Yaris.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.100
My parents said they'd help me
with the down payment.

10:38.102 --> 10:41.271
But I'd still have
to get a job.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.239
Oh, my God, that's it.

10:43.241 --> 10:46.276
That's Marc's new car.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.414
His Mustang was way cooler.

10:52.817 --> 10:54.818
Why is he parked
all the way out here?

10:54.820 --> 10:57.887
Probably 'cause people
are so interested in him.

10:57.889 --> 11:00.857
He should get the hell out
of this town after graduation,

11:00.859 --> 11:02.526
go somewhere
where he won't be known

11:02.528 --> 11:06.028
as the dead girl's boyfriend.

11:06.030 --> 11:08.498
Oh, crap.
I can't believe I said that.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.403
I am so sorry.

11:14.038 --> 11:15.872
Oh, my God.

11:15.874 --> 11:17.343
Hey, what are you doing?

11:20.312 --> 11:22.782
Stop it, Echo!
That is not funny!

11:25.984 --> 11:27.850
Do you realize
what this means?

11:27.852 --> 11:29.986
Honestly, no.

11:29.988 --> 11:31.988
We looked everywhere for this.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.391
The police were desperate
to find it,

11:34.393 --> 11:36.993
and guess who's had it
this whole time?

11:36.995 --> 11:41.464
So he didn't want everybody
reading Zoe's diary.

11:41.466 --> 11:45.267
I mean, it's probably
all about him.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.603
Exactly.

11:47.605 --> 11:50.473
He was the last person
to see Zoe alive.

11:50.475 --> 11:52.878
They found her in his car.

11:54.379 --> 11:58.915
Echo, Marc didn't kill Zoe.

11:58.917 --> 12:02.118
They caught the guy.
He confessed.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.186
Yeah.

12:04.188 --> 12:06.256
Yeah, but, Abby,
people confess all the time

12:06.258 --> 12:09.358
to crimes they didn't do.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.427
But...

12:11.429 --> 12:14.164
they found a lot of...

12:14.166 --> 12:16.802
physical evidence.

12:23.341 --> 12:24.943
Yeah.

13:11.222 --> 13:12.922
June 10th.

13:12.924 --> 13:14.424
Jeez, where to begin?

13:14.426 --> 13:16.425
Was it Lennon
who said something about

13:16.427 --> 13:20.229
life being what happens when
you're busy making other plans?

13:20.231 --> 13:24.935
Anyway, it's just
so freakin' true.

13:24.937 --> 13:28.405
Let's start with
my summer job hunt.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.507
Hey, good luck.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.374
- Thanks, Mom.
- You look beautiful.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.812
Bye.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.613
And by summer job hunt,

13:37.615 --> 13:40.919
I mean kicking it poolside
at Carley's.

13:42.486 --> 13:46.355
Hey, what Mom doesn't know
won't hurt her.

13:46.357 --> 13:49.291
Since it was
such a gorgeous summer day,

13:49.293 --> 13:54.097
it would've been a crime not
to enjoy every second of it.

14:04.543 --> 14:07.743
Hey, who's that?

14:07.745 --> 14:10.113
Blue, open shirt.

14:10.115 --> 14:11.480
Oh, my God, dude,
that's him.

14:11.482 --> 14:13.616
That's the private school guy.

14:13.618 --> 14:16.486
Remember I told you?
Shit. What's his name?

14:16.488 --> 14:18.722
Oh! His dad's like
the banker or something.

14:18.724 --> 14:19.890
Yeah, and he like
went to jail

14:19.892 --> 14:22.161
for being some like
Wall Street D-bag.

14:27.264 --> 14:30.333
You think he's hot?

14:30.335 --> 14:32.701
He's totally checking me out.

14:32.703 --> 14:34.572
Whatever.

14:37.341 --> 14:39.177
You invited him?

14:41.013 --> 14:43.379
Why are you such a snob?
Who do you think got our IDs?

14:43.381 --> 14:46.315
Yeah, $300 later.

15:01.466 --> 15:04.669
- Erica, on three.
- Hey, wait!

15:05.669 --> 15:07.270
- Wait.
- Whoa.

15:07.272 --> 15:09.772
Hey, that was close.

15:09.774 --> 15:12.408
Uh...

15:12.410 --> 15:14.212
I owe you one.

15:16.313 --> 15:17.415
I'm Marc.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.352
I'm Zoe.

15:27.091 --> 15:28.394
I'm good.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.229
Marc, the party machine.

15:33.831 --> 15:35.934
I'm in recovery.

15:37.302 --> 15:39.069
Shit.

15:39.071 --> 15:41.371
Um, are you serious?

15:41.373 --> 15:43.309
Yeah.

15:44.775 --> 15:49.280
So why the hell did you
come to a party?

15:51.549 --> 15:53.318
To meet you.

15:57.855 --> 16:03.258
And we talked for,
seriously, hours.

16:03.260 --> 16:08.166
I had the stupidest smile
on my face the whole time.

16:09.835 --> 16:14.436
I mean, I was practically
sober by the time I left.

16:35.326 --> 16:36.559
What are you doing here?

16:36.561 --> 16:38.228
I tried calling you.

16:38.230 --> 16:41.363
Yeah, I left my phone
at Carley's.

16:41.365 --> 16:43.366
Busy tomorrow?

16:43.368 --> 16:45.371
Job hunting, technically.

16:46.904 --> 16:48.339
You need a ride?

16:49.607 --> 16:52.374
Okay. 12:00.

16:52.376 --> 16:54.310
Done.

16:54.312 --> 16:56.715
- Hey, wait a sec.
- Yeah?

16:59.384 --> 17:00.719
I forgot to give you something.

17:04.155 --> 17:06.625
I pulled him in
and then kissed him.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.329
It was perfect.

17:38.722 --> 17:40.722
Well, if you're still
having trouble sleeping,

17:40.724 --> 17:43.594
maybe we can
adjust the dosage.

17:44.762 --> 17:46.764
I need that.

18:02.314 --> 18:06.415
So last week you set a goal
to spend more time together,

18:06.417 --> 18:07.584
doing something you enjoy.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.353
How's it going?

18:10.355 --> 18:11.821
Uh, it's...

18:11.823 --> 18:14.224
I've been so bogged down
at work,

18:14.226 --> 18:19.098
and Echo just started
back to school, so we...

18:22.733 --> 18:25.267
Maybe budget out
some time this week.

18:25.269 --> 18:27.370
Make it a priority.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.307
Absolutely.

18:41.019 --> 18:44.388
Echo, how's school?

18:46.290 --> 18:47.792
Good.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.562
Are you making new friends?

18:52.564 --> 18:55.030
It's only been two days.

18:55.032 --> 18:57.468
Zoe always had lots of friends.

19:08.046 --> 19:12.718
You said once that
you felt stuck in her shadow.

19:20.557 --> 19:21.926
Echo.

19:24.528 --> 19:28.363
Everything you're feeling
is normal.

19:28.365 --> 19:33.337
It's normal to be
anxious or scared.

19:34.873 --> 19:38.507
Your sister was murdered,

19:38.509 --> 19:41.477
and you're trying
to deal with that.

19:41.479 --> 19:42.780
You all are.

19:44.615 --> 19:46.548
I'm not scared.

19:46.550 --> 19:49.954
Zoe made a stupid choice.
That's on her.

20:08.405 --> 20:12.842
Turns out Marc is even
more gorgeous on day two.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.679
Wow!

20:16.681 --> 20:18.980
- Cool car.
- Thanks.

20:18.982 --> 20:20.549
Took me over a year
to rebuild it.

20:20.551 --> 20:22.852
Wait, you rebuilt this?

20:22.854 --> 20:25.688
Not the body work,
but everything under the hood.

20:25.690 --> 20:27.690
- By yourself?
- Yeah.

20:27.692 --> 20:29.558
With a little help
from YouTube.

20:40.571 --> 20:43.805
Okay, so Dr. Gallagher's first.

20:43.807 --> 20:48.044
I think he's a shrink,
and he is up on Folsom.

20:48.046 --> 20:50.613
Wait, you wanna be
a psychiatrist or something?

20:50.615 --> 20:53.482
Oh, God, no.

20:53.484 --> 20:55.751
I just need a summer job.

20:55.753 --> 20:57.754
Gotta start saving some money.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.488
What for?

20:59.490 --> 21:03.058
I wanna move to LA
after graduation.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.227
Or New York.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.828
Just somewhere I can
get modeling jobs.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.631
Modeling, huh?

21:08.633 --> 21:11.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

21:11.669 --> 21:14.069
Or acting.

21:14.071 --> 21:18.376
Really just anything
to get me out of this dump.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.647
That's priority number one.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.715
Been thinking about going to
college or anything like that?

21:25.717 --> 21:31.053
No, I mean, only if I wanna be
buried alive in student loans.

21:31.055 --> 21:34.423
No. I'm gonna skip
all that shit

21:34.425 --> 21:36.794
and start living the life
that I want.

21:39.196 --> 21:42.366
Someday everybody's
gonna know my name.

21:52.109 --> 21:55.046
"Everybody's gonna know
my name."

22:14.231 --> 22:17.499
And she didn't
tell you where she was going?

22:17.501 --> 22:19.701
You didn't ask?

22:19.703 --> 22:21.536
I asked.

22:21.538 --> 22:23.639
She said she'd tell me
when she got back.

22:23.641 --> 22:24.843
And she took your car.

22:27.912 --> 22:30.145
Is that something
she does often, Marc?

22:30.147 --> 22:32.481
Borrow your car?

22:32.483 --> 22:36.184
No, Detective,
she's never done that before.

22:36.186 --> 22:40.125
Can't think of any reason why
Zoe might want to leave town?

22:43.560 --> 22:46.464
She talks about leaving town
all the time.

22:48.066 --> 22:50.736
- But after graduation...
- Where did she wanna go?

22:52.569 --> 22:54.003
LA and New York.

22:54.005 --> 22:57.008
And how do you fit
into those plans, Marc?

23:02.579 --> 23:04.546
I don't know yet.

23:11.756 --> 23:14.159
We found your car, Marc.

23:19.663 --> 23:20.664
Marc?

23:24.568 --> 23:28.139
Are you sure there's
nothing you wanna tell us?

23:36.114 --> 23:37.680
You're not gonna believe this.

23:37.682 --> 23:40.082
Chess is having
a party tonight,

23:40.084 --> 23:42.951
and Parker invited us.

23:42.953 --> 23:44.452
Parker?

23:44.454 --> 23:48.290
He comes up to me all casual
after English class and says,

23:48.292 --> 23:51.192
"Hey, you and Echo should
come by Chess' place tonight."

23:51.194 --> 23:53.161
Like it's a passing thought.

23:53.163 --> 23:54.997
But I happen to know

23:54.999 --> 23:57.900
that Parker's in
Miss Reuben's class for third,

23:57.902 --> 24:02.606
which means he had to walk
like four hallways to find me.

24:04.842 --> 24:07.843
No chance you're slightly
overthinking this?

24:07.845 --> 24:11.814
No! Finally my high school
experience is beginning.

24:11.816 --> 24:15.217
And the popularity demographics
have shifted in our favor

24:15.219 --> 24:18.688
for probably the only time
in our lives.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.155
What?

24:20.157 --> 24:22.024
Think about it.

24:22.026 --> 24:23.726
All the popular girls
have set their sights

24:23.728 --> 24:25.728
on the juniors and seniors,

24:25.730 --> 24:30.766
which means the boys
who used to be out of our league

24:30.768 --> 24:33.201
are now at the bottom
of the picking order

24:33.203 --> 24:36.774
and totally attainable.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.710
I'm telling you,
you and I are never gonna

24:41.712 --> 24:44.715
get a chance like this again
in our lives.

24:48.185 --> 24:51.821
So this is our big chance.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.634
At least it's a party.

25:08.373 --> 25:10.875
Echo, you made it.

25:14.378 --> 25:16.013
Cool party.

25:17.181 --> 25:20.149
Yeah, we're just
getting started.

25:20.151 --> 25:25.254
We got pizza,
chips and stuff.

25:25.256 --> 25:28.289
Could I get you something
to drink? Soda?

25:28.291 --> 25:30.258
Yeah, soda's fine.

25:30.260 --> 25:31.727
Make it a double.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.237
Thanks.

25:41.239 --> 25:44.440
Sorry they're not cold.
Chess is on an ice run.

25:44.442 --> 25:45.940
Chess has his license?

25:45.942 --> 25:48.411
Uh, learner's permit.

25:48.413 --> 25:50.312
He went with his mom.

25:50.314 --> 25:51.983
Cool.

25:53.817 --> 25:56.818
Do you wanna play
some video games?

25:56.820 --> 25:59.723
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:14.806 --> 26:16.607
You wanna play?

26:25.849 --> 26:28.784
Do you wanna go outside?

26:28.786 --> 26:30.322
Yes.

26:40.198 --> 26:42.767
So I didn't see you much
this summer.

26:44.434 --> 26:46.401
Yeah, I, um...

26:46.403 --> 26:49.173
I spent a few weeks
with my grandma.

26:50.374 --> 26:52.807
And then there was the trial.

26:52.809 --> 26:54.509
Shit.

26:54.511 --> 26:56.411
Sorry, um...

26:56.413 --> 27:00.317
It's okay. It's fine.
It's over.

27:02.119 --> 27:04.855
Was he really just some guy
that she met online?

27:09.527 --> 27:11.895
Said he was a photographer.

27:18.869 --> 27:21.136
I'm sorry.
This is not a subject

27:21.138 --> 27:23.273
that I wanted
to get brought up.

27:24.842 --> 27:26.275
I know it's what
everyone's thinking

27:26.277 --> 27:28.878
when they're around me.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.346
At least you're
not afraid of me.

27:31.348 --> 27:33.417
No one is afraid of you.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.155
They're afraid
of hurting you more.

27:40.258 --> 27:41.826
I mean, you...

27:44.862 --> 27:46.898
You've already been hurt
so much.

27:59.410 --> 28:01.410
Wanna go back in?

28:01.412 --> 28:05.046
Um...

28:05.048 --> 28:08.083
No, I, um...

28:08.085 --> 28:10.119
I think I'm gonna
call it a night.

28:10.121 --> 28:13.091
I've got football practice
in the morning and...

28:15.358 --> 28:16.461
I'll see ya around?

28:23.901 --> 28:26.204
Parker, wait.

28:28.372 --> 28:30.975
I forgot to give you something.

28:45.423 --> 28:47.989
So I started my job
at the head shrinker.

28:47.991 --> 28:51.293
Way better than I thought.

28:51.295 --> 28:53.929
Plenty of opportunities
to sneak off

28:53.931 --> 28:59.101
and do whatever I want,
wherever I want.

29:00.637 --> 29:02.371
There's nothing
like that moment

29:02.373 --> 29:06.040
when you share yourself
completely with someone.

29:06.042 --> 29:09.210
With the right person,
it's not just special,

29:09.212 --> 29:11.613
it's empowering.

29:16.319 --> 29:18.386
I took Marc
to the one spot in this town

29:18.388 --> 29:20.989
that I actually like.

29:20.991 --> 29:24.093
I know I don't open up a lot,

29:24.095 --> 29:26.661
but with him,
it was easy.

29:26.663 --> 29:29.364
I've never
felt this way before.

29:29.366 --> 29:33.201
I've never laughed
with someone so much.

29:33.203 --> 29:36.071
I've never trusted
someone so much.

29:36.073 --> 29:40.008
We told each other everything.

29:40.010 --> 29:42.411
I haven't been with anyone
since my last girlfriend.

29:42.413 --> 29:44.015
Almost a year ago.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.554
What, uh, happened?

29:56.259 --> 29:58.294
Parents sent her to rehab
in Colorado

29:58.296 --> 30:02.400
and got a restraining order
against me.

30:06.537 --> 30:08.370
Whoa.

30:08.372 --> 30:12.509
Hey, look,
I was a different person then.

30:14.144 --> 30:15.544
As long as we learn
from our mistakes,

30:15.546 --> 30:18.249
they can't really
hurt us, right?

30:32.296 --> 30:34.599
I don't care about the past.

31:18.308 --> 31:21.276
Marc and I came out
as a couple tonight.

31:21.278 --> 31:24.546
I brought him
to Theresa's party.

31:24.548 --> 31:28.286
Why the hell did I think
that would be a good idea?

31:29.319 --> 31:31.386
- You came!
- Oh, hi.

31:31.388 --> 31:33.087
So, Zoe, what's your pleasure?

31:33.089 --> 31:34.489
Ooh, make her the special.

31:34.491 --> 31:37.092
You're gonna love this.

31:37.094 --> 31:40.097
All right.
One special coming up.

31:41.798 --> 31:43.364
What about you, Marc?

31:43.366 --> 31:45.633
Ginger ale if you got it.

31:47.137 --> 31:49.071
Okay. Check the fridge.

31:49.073 --> 31:53.241
My 12-year-old brother,
he loves that stuff.

31:53.243 --> 31:54.411
Will do.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.248
He's all yours, Zoe.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.350
Though why you would want him?

32:01.352 --> 32:03.651
He's in recovery, okay?

32:03.653 --> 32:05.453
Sounds like fun times.

32:05.455 --> 32:08.323
Oh, you have no idea.

32:08.325 --> 32:09.624
I do not wanna hear this
right now.

32:09.626 --> 32:11.360
- Yes, you do.
- No, no.

32:11.362 --> 32:13.398
Not without one of these.

32:14.531 --> 32:16.164
You ready for this, baby girl?

32:16.166 --> 32:20.103
One, two, three.

32:23.673 --> 32:28.610
It's crazy how quickly
a good time can turn bad.

34:16.219 --> 34:18.219
I'm really regretting
these shoes.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.920
Chess is just as tall as me.

34:19.922 --> 34:22.724
He's gonna find me
intimidating.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.358
Did you know his girlfriend

34:24.360 --> 34:25.960
got a restraining order
against him?

34:25.963 --> 34:27.762
Chess has a girlfriend?

34:27.764 --> 34:30.431
No, no, not Chess.
Marc.

34:30.434 --> 34:32.833
Oh, my God.

34:32.835 --> 34:34.835
Do I have sweat stains?

34:34.838 --> 34:36.905
Um, uh, I can't tell.

34:36.907 --> 34:39.177
- It's dark.
- Shit!

34:40.244 --> 34:41.545
Sorry!

34:45.516 --> 34:47.418
Oh, my God.

34:48.952 --> 34:53.157
You look so much like Zoe.

34:56.492 --> 34:59.197
I never noticed it before.

35:00.998 --> 35:02.867
It's freaking the hell
out of me.

35:04.735 --> 35:06.767
Sorry?

35:06.769 --> 35:10.639
No, you know what?
I'm sorry. I...

35:10.641 --> 35:12.641
I'm sorry I didn't come by.

35:12.643 --> 35:15.445
I should've seen
how you were doing.

35:19.882 --> 35:22.717
Well, I'm... I'm fine.

35:22.719 --> 35:24.454
I'm fine.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.693
Oh, my God, wait.

35:32.695 --> 35:34.762
This is your first
high school dance, isn't it?

35:34.764 --> 35:36.530
- You nervous?
- No.

35:36.532 --> 35:39.170
- You look nervous as hell.
- I'm okay.

35:40.403 --> 35:41.436
Oh, I'm okay, I'm okay.

35:43.740 --> 35:46.941
Hey, wait, look,
take one of these.

35:46.943 --> 35:49.380
It'll take the edge off.
Don't worry.

35:53.851 --> 35:55.786
We'll do it together, yeah?

35:58.021 --> 36:01.055
You ready for this,
baby girl?

36:01.057 --> 36:06.164
One, two, three.

36:13.971 --> 36:15.940
Oh, my God.

36:34.057 --> 36:36.527
God, I missed you.

36:39.730 --> 36:41.630
Uh, Echo?

36:41.632 --> 36:43.798
Would you like to dance?

36:46.969 --> 36:48.638
Right now?

37:13.664 --> 37:16.398
Well, it looks like Abby
and Chess are getting along.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.766
Yeah, um...

37:18.768 --> 37:21.338
I called that one
two weeks ago.

37:22.373 --> 37:23.407
Really?

37:25.809 --> 37:28.510
He's liked her
since sixth grade.

37:28.512 --> 37:30.612
What?

37:30.614 --> 37:33.481
You don't look too bad.

37:33.483 --> 37:37.485
Wow. He feigned
indifference perfectly.

37:37.487 --> 37:41.324
Actually, he was just
really intimidated.

37:43.793 --> 37:45.795
Talking to smart girls
is hard.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.768
I know from experience.

38:35.778 --> 38:37.914
Having fun?

38:41.552 --> 38:43.554
It's great at the beginning.

38:47.824 --> 38:49.758
Echo, stop.

38:49.760 --> 38:50.858
What?

38:50.860 --> 38:52.929
Pretending.

39:14.083 --> 39:16.952
Zoe, where are you?

39:16.954 --> 39:18.787
Zoe.

39:18.789 --> 39:21.088
Zoe.

39:21.090 --> 39:22.793
Zoe, come here.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.700
Zoe, I have to tell you.

39:32.702 --> 39:34.936
Okay, I never told you, but...

39:34.938 --> 39:37.271
Oh, my God,
it's all my fault.

39:37.273 --> 39:41.075
I never told you, but...
if you can ever forgive me,

39:41.077 --> 39:44.144
I had no idea what he was
gonna do with the video,

39:44.146 --> 39:45.679
I swear to God.

39:45.681 --> 39:48.148
Please, I'm so sorry, Zoe.

39:48.150 --> 39:50.017
Please.

40:00.898 --> 40:03.798
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.403
You okay?

40:07.036 --> 40:09.970
Yeah. I'm just a little sick.

40:09.972 --> 40:11.775
What did you take?

40:13.976 --> 40:15.478
What do you mean?

40:16.947 --> 40:19.680
This isn't you, Echo.

40:19.682 --> 40:21.615
- This is...
- Zoe.

40:21.617 --> 40:23.184
You were the last one.

40:23.186 --> 40:25.655
We're not as different
as you think.

40:37.701 --> 40:39.202
Echo.

40:40.804 --> 40:42.807
Found your car, Marc.

40:47.344 --> 40:49.146
Marc?

40:53.050 --> 40:56.821
Are you sure there's nothing
you wanna tell us?

41:45.402 --> 41:47.135
Echo?

41:47.137 --> 41:50.671
Hey, your mom's resting.
You okay here for a while?

41:50.673 --> 41:52.106
I could use a few hours
at the office,

41:52.108 --> 41:53.842
get a jump on next week.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.010
Yeah, I'm good.
No problem.

41:56.012 --> 41:57.912
Maybe you could call Abby.

41:57.914 --> 42:01.349
Nah. I'm buried
in this humanities project.

42:01.351 --> 42:03.751
Okay. You're awesome.

42:03.753 --> 42:06.954
I will be back tonight,
and I'll bring dinner.

42:06.956 --> 42:08.259
Perfect.

42:16.900 --> 42:20.168
Today I made major
progress on my modeling career.

42:24.407 --> 42:25.673
Okay, work it, girl.

42:25.675 --> 42:27.941
Get your hand on your hip
like you mean it.

42:27.943 --> 42:30.378
Okay, yes, that's it, okay.

42:30.380 --> 42:32.780
Super sexy.
That's great. Awesome.

42:32.782 --> 42:35.249
You look so good!

42:35.251 --> 42:37.418
Okay, just like that.
Do it again. Flip the hair.

42:37.420 --> 42:39.688
Great! There it goes.

42:39.690 --> 42:41.121
Great, awesome.

42:41.123 --> 42:42.923
Oh, my God.

42:42.925 --> 42:44.258
Look at this!

42:44.260 --> 42:47.461
Okay, these are some
professional-ass-looking photos.

42:47.463 --> 42:49.430
- Oh, that looks so good!
- We pulled this off.

42:49.432 --> 42:52.099
- That should be your headshot.
- Oh, my God, it looks so good.

42:52.101 --> 42:53.802
That should be your headshot.

42:53.804 --> 42:55.070
- You did a good job.
- I know!

42:55.072 --> 42:56.970
I can't believe your phone
took these, dude.

42:56.972 --> 42:58.873
- I know.
- This is insane.

42:58.875 --> 43:01.275
Wait!
I think we can both agree.

43:01.277 --> 43:04.479
Sexy look back, topless
is the obvious winner, right?

43:09.152 --> 43:11.820
All the comments
are from guys.

43:11.822 --> 43:13.987
So? Fame is fame.

43:13.989 --> 43:15.889
Oh.

43:17.260 --> 43:19.260
Thd day keeps getting better.

43:19.262 --> 43:20.829
You wanna go to Jason's?

43:20.831 --> 43:22.162
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God.

43:22.164 --> 43:23.465
You are such a freakin' snob.

43:23.467 --> 43:25.365
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

43:25.367 --> 43:28.436
Dude, he's totally sweet,
and I think he's kinda hot.

43:28.438 --> 43:30.137
Really?

43:30.139 --> 43:31.873
He's 24.

43:31.875 --> 43:33.941
Come on, please?
Please, please, please.

43:33.943 --> 43:37.211
- I'll make you a special.
- Okay.

43:37.213 --> 43:39.949
Okay, get your stuff.
I'll be inside.

43:46.056 --> 43:48.322
So you guys
go to Lincoln Carter?

43:48.324 --> 43:50.825
Yeah, we're juniors.

43:50.827 --> 43:52.860
I hate that school, man.

43:52.862 --> 43:56.733
- Principal Haynes, he's a dick.
- Yeah, totally.

43:58.934 --> 44:01.869
So when did you graduate?

44:01.871 --> 44:03.537
I got out of that
fuckin' trap years ago.

44:03.539 --> 44:06.206
The graduate from
high school trap?

44:06.208 --> 44:07.411
Yeah.

44:13.315 --> 44:16.351
I'm sorry, guys.
I gotta go.

44:16.353 --> 44:19.019
Wait, wait. Why?

44:19.021 --> 44:20.521
Your drink's ready.

44:20.523 --> 44:22.226
Stay for one. Come on.

44:25.427 --> 44:27.030
Just one drink.

44:29.398 --> 44:31.034
Okay.

44:43.813 --> 44:46.082
Something happened
last night.

45:49.545 --> 45:51.912
Hey.

45:51.914 --> 45:53.648
You see this guy?

45:53.650 --> 45:54.548
Yeah.

45:54.550 --> 45:57.184
Take a good look at his face.

45:57.186 --> 45:58.755
Do it!

46:04.460 --> 46:08.295
You ever see this guy,
you turn around, you walk away.

46:08.297 --> 46:10.331
I'm serious, Echo.

46:10.333 --> 46:11.900
Okay.

46:11.902 --> 46:13.635
Promise me.

46:13.637 --> 46:16.472
Jeez, do you need to be
so dramatic?

46:18.173 --> 46:19.476
Promise me.

46:22.378 --> 46:24.112
Fine.

46:24.114 --> 46:25.816
Yeah, I promise.

46:46.202 --> 46:47.702
Echo?

46:47.704 --> 46:50.304
Carley, hey.

46:50.306 --> 46:52.942
Hey. What's up?

46:55.277 --> 46:58.112
Uh, nothing.
I just, um...

46:58.114 --> 46:59.981
I'm really glad you called.

46:59.983 --> 47:01.950
Uh, you know what?
We're actually...

47:01.952 --> 47:03.383
We're having
a thing tonight

47:03.385 --> 47:05.088
if you wanna come party
with us, baby girl.

47:06.456 --> 47:07.988
Yeah.

47:07.990 --> 47:09.724
Yeah, yeah, okay.

47:09.726 --> 47:12.260
Cool. Theresa's house.
Anytime.

47:12.262 --> 47:14.064
We'll be going all night.

48:29.572 --> 48:33.074
Hey.

48:33.076 --> 48:36.380
I'm Jason.

48:40.215 --> 48:42.351
I knew your sister.

48:44.054 --> 48:46.054
Uh, I'm Echo.

48:46.056 --> 48:48.423
What are you doing here?

48:48.425 --> 48:52.260
I thought that you were
at The Hunt tonight.

48:52.262 --> 48:55.530
I'm on my way. I just thought
I'd stop in and socialize.

48:55.532 --> 48:58.099
Echo, is that you?

48:58.101 --> 49:00.834
Oh, hi.

49:00.836 --> 49:02.769
Echo, what are you,
like 16?

49:02.771 --> 49:05.572
She's a baby.

49:05.574 --> 49:07.310
What are you drinking?

49:09.778 --> 49:12.282
I have no idea.

49:16.119 --> 49:17.717
Mm-mm.

49:17.719 --> 49:19.989
I'm gonna make you
something special.

49:22.724 --> 49:25.594
Echo, come here.
Um, listen.

49:27.664 --> 49:30.831
Jason, he's...
He's cool, but...

49:30.833 --> 49:34.337
Oh, shit! I think someone
just puked in my parents' room.

49:38.474 --> 49:39.507
Marc?

49:39.509 --> 49:41.177
Let's go.

49:45.447 --> 49:47.447
Marc, Marc!

49:47.449 --> 49:49.583
Marc, let me go!
What the hell is going on?

49:49.585 --> 49:51.251
I'm taking you home.

49:51.253 --> 49:54.354
I'm not an idiot.
I know what I'm doing.

49:54.356 --> 49:55.488
No, you don't.

49:55.490 --> 49:59.362
I'm only here
for one reason: Jason.

50:05.335 --> 50:08.572
Something happened to Zoe.

50:10.539 --> 50:11.873
Did she tell you?

50:11.875 --> 50:13.907
No.

50:13.909 --> 50:16.577
No, she never
talked about it,

50:16.579 --> 50:19.347
but I know
Carley and Jason know,

50:19.349 --> 50:21.751
and I think they trust me.

50:22.918 --> 50:24.186
Echo, no.

50:25.288 --> 50:26.753
What do you mean, no?

50:26.755 --> 50:28.290
Jason is dangerous.

50:29.425 --> 50:30.627
How do you know?

50:37.534 --> 50:39.736
What happened to Zoe, Marc?

50:44.206 --> 50:46.675
I don't have the answers, Echo.

51:56.012 --> 51:57.614
Where's Jason?

51:58.614 --> 51:59.815
Back room.

53:23.865 --> 53:27.735
You said we could
make a deal, so deal.

55:09.572 --> 55:12.072
Dude, that is really freaky.

55:12.074 --> 55:13.941
What?

55:13.943 --> 55:17.547
People were just starting
to act normal around you.

55:18.914 --> 55:20.847
My God, is that the same shirt
she was wearing

55:20.849 --> 55:22.652
on the "Have You Seen Me"
poster?

55:23.885 --> 55:25.788
Shit.

55:41.237 --> 55:43.737
Carley.

55:43.739 --> 55:44.838
Echo.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.574
Wow, uh...

55:46.576 --> 55:47.811
Sweetie, you look...

55:49.579 --> 55:51.244
Sorry I took off
the other night.

55:51.246 --> 55:53.716
No, no, it's okay.
I'm glad you did, actually.

55:55.518 --> 55:57.985
Well, that sounded wrong.
Um...

55:57.987 --> 56:00.086
I'm actually really happy
that you came.

56:00.088 --> 56:01.956
What I meant was...

56:03.860 --> 56:06.628
Shit. Sorry.
I gotta go to class.

56:12.735 --> 56:14.601
I feel...

56:14.603 --> 56:16.003
I don't know.

56:16.005 --> 56:17.907
I can't even write it down.

56:21.577 --> 56:23.077
For the last few days,

56:23.079 --> 56:26.713
I've done my best
to avoid Carley.

56:26.715 --> 56:29.148
Hey! Hey, Zoe!

56:29.150 --> 56:32.653
Hey, hey, Zoe,
wait up, jeez!

56:32.655 --> 56:35.889
What the hell's your problem?

56:35.891 --> 56:38.291
Like you really
need an explanation?

56:38.293 --> 56:40.793
God, relax.

56:40.795 --> 56:43.197
It's not like anyone's
gonna ever know anything.

56:43.199 --> 56:45.199
Are you stupid, Carley?

56:45.201 --> 56:47.200
Everybody is gonna
find out, okay?

56:47.202 --> 56:49.438
Jason said...

56:50.972 --> 56:52.608
What?

57:00.215 --> 57:02.550
I can't believe
that you did this to me.

57:02.552 --> 57:04.552
God, it's not like anyone
held a gun to your head,

57:04.554 --> 57:08.222
so stop acting like
such a little fucking baby.

57:08.224 --> 57:10.891
And let's get one thing
straight, okay?

57:10.893 --> 57:14.228
Nobody made anybody do anything
they weren't willing to do.

57:14.230 --> 57:16.863
You participated
of your own free will, Zo.

57:16.865 --> 57:19.867
Is it still my free will

57:19.869 --> 57:23.737
if I'm fucked up
on something that he gave me?

57:23.739 --> 57:26.139
You took it
right out of his hand.

57:26.141 --> 57:27.777
Nobody forced you.

57:31.614 --> 57:33.613
This is all gonna come back
and haunt us.

57:33.615 --> 57:35.951
You realize that, right?

58:30.905 --> 58:32.875
I feel broken.

58:47.422 --> 58:49.923
Echo's birthday
is coming up soon,

58:49.925 --> 58:53.860
and she's starting
high school next fall,

58:53.862 --> 58:57.130
and that's when all
the big drama starts, right?

58:57.132 --> 59:00.266
So I thought
I'd get her a diary.

59:00.268 --> 59:02.235
I found a really pretty one
at the bookstore,

59:02.237 --> 59:05.774
and I hid it in my sock box,
so she won't find it.

59:46.181 --> 59:48.215
Happy birthday, Echo.

59:48.217 --> 59:51.985
May your days be filled
with excitement and fun,

59:51.987 --> 59:54.987
and may you record it all here.

01:00:37.532 --> 01:00:39.532
Well, it's normal to make

01:00:39.534 --> 01:00:41.534
several adjustments
to your dosage

01:00:41.536 --> 01:00:43.804
before you find
the right balance.

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:46.039
I just don't sleep.

01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:49.776
- Well, that's a problem.
- Yeah.

01:00:49.778 --> 01:00:52.912
Bullshit.

01:00:52.914 --> 01:00:55.081
All she does is sleep.

01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:57.351
Twenty hours a day.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.552
I'm not sure
if that's accurate.

01:00:59.554 --> 01:01:01.521
You're not sure
it's not accurate either

01:01:01.523 --> 01:01:03.557
'cause you're never home.

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.793
We've had a lot
of changes at work...

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:08.061
Bullshit! That's bull...
That's bullshit.

01:01:08.063 --> 01:01:10.365
Work isn't what changed.

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:18.104
You've all experienced
a great deal of change, Echo.

01:01:18.106 --> 01:01:20.007
And change is stressful.

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:22.141
That's why we're here,

01:01:22.143 --> 01:01:25.278
so we can talk through
those things.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.081
So what do you
wanna talk about?

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:29.249
Your parents?

01:01:29.251 --> 01:01:31.184
School?

01:01:31.186 --> 01:01:33.121
Boys?

01:01:34.456 --> 01:01:37.124
Zoe?

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:39.461
Were the two of you close?

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:41.862
Not really.

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.166
Is that something you regret?

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:50.037
It was her way
of protecting me.

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:53.307
From what?

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:54.941
From making the same mistakes.

01:01:54.943 --> 01:01:56.142
Zoe made mistakes?

01:01:56.144 --> 01:01:58.878
Well, she's dead.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.882
You know, Echo,
it seems to me you feel like

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:04.550
Zoe was to blame
for what happened to her.

01:02:04.552 --> 01:02:06.353
Is that true?

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:08.354
We don't know
what happened to her.

01:02:08.356 --> 01:02:10.023
The story that came out
at the trial...

01:02:10.025 --> 01:02:13.025
Well, is that the whole story?

01:02:13.027 --> 01:02:15.963
Do we... Do we even know
what really happened?

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:17.930
We don't know.

01:02:17.932 --> 01:02:20.166
The jury didn't know
my sister.

01:02:20.168 --> 01:02:22.135
You didn't know my sister.

01:02:22.137 --> 01:02:23.470
My parents didn't know
my sister.

01:02:23.472 --> 01:02:26.142
I barely knew my sister.

01:02:27.141 --> 01:02:29.978
How did we all not know?

01:02:31.012 --> 01:02:34.947
Mom, how did you not know?

01:02:34.949 --> 01:02:37.516
How did you not know?
She worked for you.

01:02:37.518 --> 01:02:41.323
She wasn't some naive girl.
She was smart.

01:02:44.559 --> 01:02:47.094
I just don't understand
how this happened,

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:51.333
how she put herself
in this position.

01:02:54.969 --> 01:02:57.339
I just don't understand.

01:03:21.262 --> 01:03:22.898
Marc?

01:03:40.949 --> 01:03:44.483
I took it from your car.

01:03:44.485 --> 01:03:46.321
I know.

01:03:56.565 --> 01:04:00.436
You loved her, didn't you?

01:04:03.338 --> 01:04:05.173
Still do.

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:10.880
You were the only one
who really knew her.

01:04:15.317 --> 01:04:20.019
There was a time
we told each other everything.

01:04:20.021 --> 01:04:23.458
Never had anyone like that
in my life.

01:04:25.594 --> 01:04:30.097
Those last couple weeks
she just...

01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:32.401
It's like she closed off.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.106
Something was wrong,
and she wouldn't say it.

01:04:40.141 --> 01:04:43.278
I didn't know anything about
Jason until I read her diary.

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:52.420
Carley said something
about a video.

01:04:54.356 --> 01:04:56.623
What do you mean?

01:04:56.625 --> 01:04:59.159
She was wasted.
She thought I was Zoe,

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:02.195
and she said
that she didn't know

01:05:02.197 --> 01:05:04.500
what he was gonna do
with the video.

01:05:07.635 --> 01:05:09.568
- I can get it.
- How?

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:12.738
Well, there's a good bet
that it's at Jason's house,

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:14.474
so all I have to do
is go over there...

01:05:14.476 --> 01:05:16.776
- Echo, are you insane?
- Just let me finish.

01:05:16.778 --> 01:05:19.813
I go there with Carley,
there's a distraction,

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:21.617
and I search the place.

01:05:23.818 --> 01:05:25.621
What distraction, Echo?

01:05:26.688 --> 01:05:27.690
You.

01:05:34.128 --> 01:05:35.327
Carley!

01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:36.595
Hey, cutie, what's up?

01:05:36.597 --> 01:05:37.831
Hey, do you have a sec?

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:40.269
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.742
Uh, she bought them
on the trip to...

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.110
To Key West.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:52.545
With my parents.

01:05:52.547 --> 01:05:54.616
Summer after eighth grade.

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:59.552
I remember she bought them
from some vendor,

01:05:59.554 --> 01:06:03.058
and she talked the guy down
to like 12 bucks.

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:09.465
Zoe would want you
to have them.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:16.338
I'm not so sure.

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.309
Hey, ladies!

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.546
You disappeared the other night.

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:28.882
What?

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:31.150
Theresa's party.

01:06:31.152 --> 01:06:33.119
Oh, uh...

01:06:33.121 --> 01:06:34.720
Yeah, it got a little
crowded for me.

01:06:34.722 --> 01:06:35.655
I get ya.

01:06:35.657 --> 01:06:37.691
Hey, we're going
to my place now.

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.892
Just us, no crowds.

01:06:39.894 --> 01:06:41.327
You wanna come?

01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:43.329
Echo's busy.

01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:45.764
Right? Your mom needed you
for something.

01:06:45.766 --> 01:06:47.566
No, she's fine.

01:06:47.568 --> 01:06:50.202
I just have to call her
and let her know I'll be late.

01:06:50.204 --> 01:06:51.637
Jason, it's really
not a good day.

01:06:51.639 --> 01:06:52.905
I've got like
a lot of crap I gotta...

01:06:52.907 --> 01:06:54.777
Okay, so don't come.

01:06:55.777 --> 01:06:57.213
You wanna come, Echo?

01:06:58.547 --> 01:06:59.648
Yeah.

01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:03.452
Then I'm coming too.

01:07:04.786 --> 01:07:07.556
I just, uh,
have to call my mom.

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.237
Hey, Echo.

01:07:24.239 --> 01:07:25.671
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:07:25.673 --> 01:07:27.007
I just, uh,
I wanted to ask

01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:29.842
'cause Abby and Chess
are going to a movie and...

01:07:29.844 --> 01:07:31.610
Are you on the phone?

01:07:31.612 --> 01:07:33.412
Uh, have you seen Marc?

01:07:33.414 --> 01:07:35.414
Everything okay, Echo?

01:07:35.416 --> 01:07:38.184
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:07:38.186 --> 01:07:40.420
Zoe's Marc.
Have you seen him?

01:07:40.422 --> 01:07:42.521
- No.
- You coming?

01:07:42.523 --> 01:07:45.391
Yeah, just a second.

01:07:45.393 --> 01:07:47.961
Uh, I-I gotta go.

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:50.298
Yeah, um...

01:07:52.266 --> 01:07:54.135
You're so cute.

01:08:09.818 --> 01:08:11.284
Cool place.

01:08:11.286 --> 01:08:12.655
Thanks.

01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:17.857
I, uh, love old houses.

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:19.593
They have history.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:24.198
All kinds of crazy shit's
gone down in this place.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:27.767
So what's your pleasure, ladies?

01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:29.770
We're not staying long.

01:08:31.805 --> 01:08:33.706
Uh, can I get a tour?

01:08:33.707 --> 01:08:35.442
Sure.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.813
Tom, show her around.

01:08:39.913 --> 01:08:42.585
You got the living room.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:47.689
Bedrooms,
bathroom over there.

01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:51.859
I'm not gonna let you
do this to her.

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:58.365
You like your pills, right?

01:08:58.367 --> 01:09:01.337
Hey, the price just went up.

01:09:04.537 --> 01:09:05.740
Kitchen.

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:15.350
What's down there?

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:18.751
Oh, it's, uh,

01:09:18.752 --> 01:09:20.421
it's our workspace.

01:09:34.801 --> 01:09:36.505
Hey, beautiful.

01:09:38.038 --> 01:09:39.640
Make yourself comfortable.

01:09:46.581 --> 01:09:47.783
Hey.

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:50.419
Bottoms up.

01:10:02.463 --> 01:10:07.400
Oh, shit!
Hey, baby sister can hang, bro.

01:10:22.684 --> 01:10:24.083
Hey, Marc,
Echo was looking for you.

01:10:24.085 --> 01:10:26.652
- Look, I know, all right?
- Is she in some trouble?

01:10:26.654 --> 01:10:28.620
Yeah!

01:10:28.622 --> 01:10:29.924
Okay, then I'm coming with.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.563
- You ever been in a fight?
- No.

01:10:36.997 --> 01:10:38.897
Great.

01:10:49.677 --> 01:10:51.643
You should've
went in there with her.

01:10:51.645 --> 01:10:53.946
She's gonna pass out
in there with the door locked.

01:10:53.948 --> 01:10:56.816
All right, worst case,
Carley goes through the window.

01:10:56.818 --> 01:10:58.418
Hell no!

01:11:01.021 --> 01:11:02.421
Fuck!

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:08.727
You fucking idiot.

01:11:08.729 --> 01:11:10.662
Yeah, 'cause you parked
four feet from the curb.

01:11:10.664 --> 01:11:12.368
- I'm calling the cops.
- Marc?

01:11:30.985 --> 01:11:33.753
Are you shitting me?
You just hit my car!

01:11:33.755 --> 01:11:36.358
Yeah, 'cause you park
like an asshole!

01:12:55.569 --> 01:12:56.768
Jason!

01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:58.771
Jason, would you guys
just fucking stop?

01:12:58.773 --> 01:12:59.804
Shut up!

01:12:59.806 --> 01:13:02.110
Fine. I hope
he kicks your ass.

01:13:20.595 --> 01:13:22.661
Carley.

01:13:22.663 --> 01:13:24.196
Carley, you're hurting me.

01:13:24.198 --> 01:13:26.732
It's fine, Zoe.
Trust me.

01:13:26.734 --> 01:13:28.166
- It's gonna look so good.
- Carley, please.

01:13:28.168 --> 01:13:29.505
Fuck her, bro.

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:33.409
Echo.

01:13:34.275 --> 01:13:35.174
Don't come near me.

01:13:35.176 --> 01:13:38.177
Please, just let me help you.

01:13:38.179 --> 01:13:39.547
Why?

01:13:49.757 --> 01:13:51.760
Because I didn't help Zoe.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.764
And now she's dead.

01:14:00.268 --> 01:14:02.101
Bitch!

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:12.312
Where the fuck is Carley?

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:13.782
Fuck!

01:14:15.716 --> 01:14:17.983
I didn't know what he was gonna
do with the video, I swear.

01:14:17.985 --> 01:14:20.852
I didn't know
about Jason's site.

01:14:20.854 --> 01:14:23.491
So Jason posted it
on his site?

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.061
So everyone saw Zoe...

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:30.897
No. No, no, no.
It's not that kind of site.

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:32.932
It's private.

01:14:32.934 --> 01:14:34.767
It's not a public site.

01:14:34.769 --> 01:14:36.768
It's private
and expensive

01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:39.907
for like specific clientele.

01:14:41.309 --> 01:14:44.110
We're talking about
child porn here, right?

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:46.778
I had no idea.
We were just messing around.

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.380
The son of a bitch
is going to jail.

01:14:48.382 --> 01:14:50.083
Wait!

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:52.921
Echo, there's one more thing.

01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:58.825
The guy, the one who...

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:01.063
Zoe's killer.

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:05.067
He was a subscriber.

01:15:07.735 --> 01:15:09.302
Oh, my God.

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:11.137
He said
he was a photographer,

01:15:11.139 --> 01:15:13.106
and he wanted
to work with Zoe,

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:15.074
so he contacted Jason,
and they worked out a price.

01:15:15.076 --> 01:15:17.043
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:25.418
There she is,
back for more.

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.623
Dude, shut up.

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:32.090
Come in.

01:15:32.092 --> 01:15:33.595
Join us.

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:42.571
Dude, get this shit
out of here.

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:54.950
You said we could
make a deal, so deal.

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.889
Go.

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:15.067
Guy's totally well-connected.

01:16:15.069 --> 01:16:17.704
Guy works with
all the big agencies.

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:21.874
Now, he asked me
if I knew someone special,

01:16:21.876 --> 01:16:23.311
and I thought of you.

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:30.819
For a photo shoot.

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:38.694
This is a no-shit
premium opportunity for you.

01:16:41.195 --> 01:16:44.429
And this guy is so premium,
so well-connected,

01:16:44.431 --> 01:16:49.036
that he really needs you
to find models for him?

01:16:50.404 --> 01:16:52.940
He's a personal friend.

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:57.613
Yeah, well...

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:03.382
any friend of yours
has gotta be an asshole.

01:17:03.384 --> 01:17:06.688
You wanna make a deal or not?

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.360
Carley.

01:17:14.362 --> 01:17:16.528
Carley, you're hurting me.

01:17:16.530 --> 01:17:18.430
It's fine, Zoe.
Trust me.

01:17:18.432 --> 01:17:23.236
- It's gonna look so good.
- Carley, please.

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:27.775
Please.

01:17:31.078 --> 01:17:32.813
Oh, yeah.

01:17:36.417 --> 01:17:38.020
Please stop.

01:17:49.096 --> 01:17:51.464
Like I said on the phone,

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:54.069
you can make all this
go away.

01:17:58.439 --> 01:18:00.976
Just meet with the guy.

01:18:06.146 --> 01:18:07.914
Carley, where's Echo?

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:10.215
She's down here.
She's out cold.

01:18:10.217 --> 01:18:13.052
- Open the door!
- I've gotta get a phone.

01:18:13.054 --> 01:18:14.120
What are you doing
in there?

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:16.425
Open the fucking door!

01:18:17.992 --> 01:18:19.427
I can do it.

01:18:21.429 --> 01:18:23.595
I'm taking Echo home now.

01:18:31.872 --> 01:18:33.438
Dude, what the fuck?

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.278
The dope whore's been
shooting her mouth off.

01:18:41.882 --> 01:18:43.915
About your sister,

01:18:43.917 --> 01:18:47.121
it was never supposed
to go down that way.

01:18:49.489 --> 01:18:52.493
Shut the fuck up
and give me the ties, man.

01:18:58.065 --> 01:19:00.398
We let her out of this room,
where's she gonna go?

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.799
Straight to the cops.

01:19:01.801 --> 01:19:05.103
And when that happens,
and they make that connection

01:19:05.105 --> 01:19:07.505
between that psycho killer
and our site,

01:19:07.507 --> 01:19:10.375
they'll have us for
child porn and trafficking

01:19:10.377 --> 01:19:12.477
and whatever it is
when you help a murderer.

01:19:12.479 --> 01:19:14.179
Dude, you don't know what
you're fucking talking about!

01:19:14.181 --> 01:19:16.514
I do because I looked it up.

01:19:16.516 --> 01:19:18.116
It's called
"accessory to murder."

01:19:24.057 --> 01:19:25.657
The bitch bit me.

01:19:25.659 --> 01:19:27.393
We're all fucked!

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:29.461
No.

01:19:29.463 --> 01:19:33.132
We'll wait till it's dark,
then we take them out.

01:19:33.134 --> 01:19:35.034
I know a place.

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:37.506
What are you talking about?

01:19:38.972 --> 01:19:39.839
Carley's not gonna be
a problem.

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:41.040
I've got her under control.

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.607
Okay, so what about her?

01:19:42.609 --> 01:19:45.010
You sold her sister
to a killer, man.

01:19:45.012 --> 01:19:47.149
You think she's gonna
let that stand?

01:20:00.261 --> 01:20:02.327
I swear to God
I didn't know.

01:20:02.329 --> 01:20:04.629
Stop!

01:20:04.631 --> 01:20:07.232
There's only one way
to clean this up.

01:20:07.234 --> 01:20:09.235
I'll do it if you can't.

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:12.004
Will you stop talking like
you're in a gangster movie!

01:20:12.006 --> 01:20:13.940
I'm just saying
what we both know.

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:15.275
Half of Lincoln Carter
High School

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:18.413
saw her get into my car
after school, you fucking moron!

01:20:20.213 --> 01:20:21.613
What if we let 'em go?

01:20:21.615 --> 01:20:23.350
Twenty years, man.

01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:34.660
How do we get out?

01:20:34.662 --> 01:20:37.362
All right, my brother-in-law
lives in Vegas.

01:20:37.364 --> 01:20:39.331
All right, we move
the whole setup there.

01:20:39.333 --> 01:20:41.968
We could be up and running
in three, maybe four days.

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.905
Okay, so what about them?

01:20:48.475 --> 01:20:51.043
Do you know how quickly the cops
can be all over this place?

01:20:51.045 --> 01:20:53.979
Not until 24 hours until
a person's reported missing.

01:20:53.981 --> 01:20:55.414
Really?

01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:57.282
I'm pretty sure.

01:20:57.284 --> 01:20:59.518
Well, would you look it up?
It's kinda important!

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.320
Fine!

01:21:01.322 --> 01:21:05.627
But if I'm right,
we're gonna need those 24 hours.

01:21:12.199 --> 01:21:14.034
You handle it.

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:18.139
And I don't ever wanna know how.

01:21:24.444 --> 01:21:26.614
And my car? It's fucked.

01:21:27.614 --> 01:21:30.085
I need a truck for the gear.

01:22:28.341 --> 01:22:30.576
Carley, Carley.
Carley, I need you.

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.544
I need you to wake up, Carley.

01:22:32.546 --> 01:22:35.380
Come on, Carley, Carley, Carley.

01:22:40.822 --> 01:22:42.489
Parker!

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:47.660
Call the police,
call the police.

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:50.228
Carley!
Carley, come on.

01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:53.432
Carley. Hurry!

01:22:53.434 --> 01:22:55.733
Carley, Carley, Carley.

01:22:55.735 --> 01:23:00.339
Um, uh, kidnapping, assault,
and there's a girl...

01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:03.310
Echo, someone's
coming downstairs.

01:23:06.113 --> 01:23:07.181
Echo, address.

01:23:14.221 --> 01:23:16.190
1849 Hill Street.

01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:19.692
1849 Hill Street.

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:22.794
You'll see a couple cars
crashed out front.

01:23:22.796 --> 01:23:25.798
We're in the basement.

01:24:00.734 --> 01:24:02.737
I remember last summer.

01:24:07.507 --> 01:24:12.277
A bunch of us went out
to the old rock quarry,

01:24:12.279 --> 01:24:16.549
and we hiked up these cliffs
where you can jump like...

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:19.621
fifty feet into the water.

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:33.732
But jumping
from that high

01:24:33.734 --> 01:24:37.769
sends you really deep
down into the water.

01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:42.340
So deep that
it's actually dark down there.

01:24:42.342 --> 01:24:47.414
I could see the surface,
but it seemed so far away.

01:24:48.815 --> 01:24:51.482
I was sure I would
run out of air and die

01:24:51.484 --> 01:24:53.652
before I could get there.

01:24:53.654 --> 01:24:57.492
And that's what the past
few weeks have felt like.

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:25.619
For the ducks.

01:25:28.555 --> 01:25:32.593
I, uh, I can't stay long.

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:36.498
You okay?

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.170
I never said
I was perfect, Marc.

01:25:44.438 --> 01:25:46.440
Zoe, I don't want you to be.

01:25:52.345 --> 01:25:53.879
As long as we learn
from our mistakes

01:25:53.881 --> 01:25:58.520
they can't really
hurt us, right?

01:26:02.922 --> 01:26:06.894
I wish you would tell me, Zoe.
Maybe I can help.

01:26:08.996 --> 01:26:14.502
Well, actually,
you can help.

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.669
If I could borrow your car.

01:26:17.671 --> 01:26:19.571
Ooh. What?

01:26:19.573 --> 01:26:20.906
I'm a good driver.

01:26:20.908 --> 01:26:23.008
- I don't know, Zoe.
- Come on.

01:26:23.010 --> 01:26:26.344
I'll take perfect care of it,
I swear.

01:26:26.346 --> 01:26:29.514
How do I know it's gonna
come back in one piece?

01:26:29.516 --> 01:26:31.950
I need some collateral.
Mm-hmm.

01:26:31.952 --> 01:26:34.255
You got anything valuable
in here?

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:38.057
- Lip gloss.
- Ooh!

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:39.791
- What is this?
- No, wait, no, no, no.

01:26:39.793 --> 01:26:41.693
Give it back. No, seriously.
Give it back.

01:26:41.695 --> 01:26:43.931
I already have it.

01:26:59.479 --> 01:27:01.281
I've gotta go.

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:04.586
Where?

01:27:07.421 --> 01:27:08.821
I'll tell you later.

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:10.358
Zoe, when?

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.395
Tonight.

01:27:16.029 --> 01:27:19.531
After it's all over...

01:27:19.533 --> 01:27:21.336
and in the past.

01:27:29.676 --> 01:27:31.679
I found a way to fix things.

01:27:33.079 --> 01:27:35.446
All right,
but if you don't come back,

01:27:35.448 --> 01:27:37.451
I'm for sure reading it.

01:27:38.452 --> 01:27:39.651
Car keys.

01:27:39.653 --> 01:27:41.018
Uh-uh.

01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.023
Kiss first.

01:27:45.525 --> 01:27:47.058
Be safe.

01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:48.727
- I'll text you tonight.
- Okay.

01:27:48.729 --> 01:27:49.896
- Love you.
- Love you.

01:27:56.436 --> 01:27:58.836
I can't change
what happened,

01:27:58.838 --> 01:28:01.139
but I wish I could.

01:28:01.141 --> 01:28:04.610
I can't change
how I'm going to fix it,

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:07.178
but I know I can.

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:10.951
I'm going to make it
back to the surface.

01:28:15.523 --> 01:28:18.723
I didn't think I'd ever
feel this way again.

01:28:18.725 --> 01:28:20.728
But everything's gonna be okay.

01:29:11.479 --> 01:29:13.748
So this is goodbye.

01:29:23.556 --> 01:29:25.626
You're brave, Zoe.

01:29:27.661 --> 01:29:29.497
I didn't know.

01:29:32.733 --> 01:29:37.471
I'm so sorry that
I didn't know you better.

01:31:39.963 --> 01:31:41.192
