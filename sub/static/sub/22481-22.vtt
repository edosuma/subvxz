WEBVTT

00:05.439 --> 00:06.874
All right, boys,
ring the doorbell
and ditch

00:06.940 --> 00:08.276
before somebody answers.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.278
Me and Leroy got
those two houses.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.979
Darryl, you
take that one.
Come on.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.629
MAN: Hey.

00:30.498 --> 00:31.965
Aw, shoot. The cops.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.068
BOY: No, they
ain't here for us.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.571
Okay, let me see hands.
Hands.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.006
What are you running from?

00:39.073 --> 00:41.075
Officer, we were just playing
a stupid game.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.510
Up against the car.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.080
Now.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.420
A burglary
was reported in the area.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.754
We're looking for suspects.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.889
Why are you talking to us?
We didn't steal nothin'.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.659
Because you fit
the description,
smart-ass.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.195
Yeah, right, young,
black and breathing.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.963
Darryl, shut up.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.166
Man, forget this.
Both of you shut up.
And I said don't move!

01:05.233 --> 01:07.568
You didn't say that.
You said to...
I said don't move!

01:07.635 --> 01:08.802
You understand English?

01:08.869 --> 01:10.738
DARRYL:
Why you bum
I ain't do nothin'!

01:10.804 --> 01:11.972
This ain't right!

01:13.073 --> 01:15.109
This is how
cops get shot.

01:15.176 --> 01:19.180
I told you keep your hands
where I could see them.
You understand?

01:19.247 --> 01:23.384
Hey, stop resisting!
Do you want to get shot?
No!

01:23.451 --> 01:25.153
He doesn't want
to get shot.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.088
None of us do. Please.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.159
Padulla.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.194
They got nothing on 'em.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.362
I think they get the point.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.138
Have a nice evening.

01:44.205 --> 01:48.776
You see those
robbery suspects,
you call us. Okay?

01:50.311 --> 01:52.012
LEROY: Let's go.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.781
Come on, Darryl.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.418
* *

02:01.889 --> 02:04.057
Stupid cops.
Boy, what'd I tell you
about slamming my door?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.260
Darryl started talking,
this cop grabbed him,

02:06.327 --> 02:08.162
it looked like
he was gonna shoot him.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.530
Is everybody okay?

02:09.597 --> 02:11.532
I used all the rules
you taught me.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.334
I did everything they asked.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.736
Kept my hands in view,
kept my voice calm.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.538
You tried not to give them
a reason to fear you?

02:17.605 --> 02:18.972
Yeah.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.211
Son, I'm-a tell
you something.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.746
Some people fear you
without even knowing you.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.716
It's black versus blue.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.150
But it don't
got to be that way.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.254
Maybe.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.389
But what do you think
you can do about it, Hondo?

02:38.226 --> 02:39.727
All right,
we got a hostage situation.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.762
Suspect's name
is Christian Baty.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.631
Someone called 911,
saying he's threatened
to shoot

02:43.697 --> 02:46.200
his two kids, his girlfriend
and himself with an AK-12.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.369
These guys always want
to kill themselves last.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.871
They should try
going first.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.940
We got any word on Street?
He knows he's on standby.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.243
I tried his cell a few times,
but he's not picking up.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.844
But I'm gonna
keep on trying.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.921
CORTEZ: 911 caller says
Baty has hostages in danger.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.657
You need to go in now.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.625
All right, we're a man down,
but we're ready to go in.

03:11.692 --> 03:15.062
Heat sensors can't
identify which room
Baty or the hostages are in.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.730
The front door is reinforced.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.399
All right, well, we brought
our own reinforcements.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.100
Okay, we got the
Rook, let's do this.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.571
WOMAN: Please stand back.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.646
Nice of you
to join us, Street.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.515
I'm sorry, I didn't get
the message right away.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.149
I know we don't do excuses,
but my mom,

03:36.216 --> 03:37.818
she got this job
in Lincoln Heights,

03:37.885 --> 03:39.753
and she was supposed
to take the train,

03:39.820 --> 03:42.089
and then she started
getting all these anxieties,
and she asked me to take her.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.557
It's not gonna happen again.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.526
You get familiar
with the layout,
get squared away.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.894
Yeah. Thanks. I'll be ready.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.129
Boss?

03:49.196 --> 03:52.800
This job,
it's a good thing for her.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.768
Get ready to roll, Street.
All right.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.009
Chris, Street, go.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.634
* *

04:35.376 --> 04:37.978
All set. Three, two, one.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.498
HONDO: L.A.P.D.!
On the ground!

04:57.565 --> 04:59.467
LUCA: Christian Baty,
get down on the ground!

04:59.533 --> 05:01.068
All the way!
HONDO: Give me a two!

05:01.134 --> 05:02.703
DEACON: Left side clear.
TAN: Right side's clear.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.104
All right, he's unarmed.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.539
We got Christian Baty.
STREET: Roger that.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.475
No hostages, our end.
House is clear.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.009
No girlfriend, no kids.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.210
Something's off.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.246
You want to tell us
what the hell is going on?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.182
You're the ones busted
in here, you tell me.

05:15.248 --> 05:18.386
Why'd somebody call 911,
say you were about to kill
your girlfriend and kids?

05:18.452 --> 05:21.088
I don't have a girlfriend,
or kids!

05:21.154 --> 05:22.990
Damn, sounds like we
just got swatted, boss.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.859
Hondo, we may
have something.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.163
TAN: Blast plates,
caps, copper fuses.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.265
Somebody's been messing
with explosives here.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.101
Making something pretty big.
It's a list of cities.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.404
Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills,
Ladera Heights, Inglewood.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.238
Possible targets?

05:38.305 --> 05:39.973
Those are all
black neighborhoods.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.345
Hey. Who are you?

05:45.413 --> 05:46.780
What the hell
do you have planned?

06:23.551 --> 06:26.587
Hondo, this is
Agent Elliott Gines,
point for the FBI.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.789
S.W.A.T.'s here to help,
but I'd be lying
if I didn't say

06:28.856 --> 06:30.791
this guy's list
of possible targets
feels personal.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.526
Completely understand,
Sergeant.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.429
Now, I've interviewed
Christian Baty twice
in the last six months.

06:35.496 --> 06:38.331
He made the FBI's watch list
for researching
improvised explosive devices,

06:38.398 --> 06:39.533
along with this.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.970
Baty just happens to be
a member of a white pride

06:43.036 --> 06:45.005
chat group called the
"Ultimate Patriots."

06:45.072 --> 06:47.941
These guys espouse violence
based on the fear

06:48.008 --> 06:49.342
of the "surging
minority threat."

06:49.409 --> 06:50.944
Yeah, they sound awesome.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.313
Yeah, the kind of awesome
that hides behind pseudonyms
and avatars.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.016
Most of the time,
this kind of chat group
is all talk, no bite.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.351
But a few days ago,
this one went silent.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.288
Not before hinting
at something big
happening today, though.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.956
We found TATP residue
in his house.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.593
Evidence that Baty's
making explosives,
but where are they now?

07:05.659 --> 07:09.029
I got unis running
extra patrols from Crenshaw
to Ladera Heights.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.898
If they see anything,
we're mobilizing.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.432
Sir, South L.A.
is full of soft targets.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.468
We need to find out exactly
what Baty's got planned.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.003
And who else he might
be working with.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.905
We can search for the
real names of the people
in this chat group.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.039
"WhitePridePiper,"

07:19.106 --> 07:20.207
"AlbinoAlbert"

07:20.273 --> 07:21.374
and "ChicksDigAryans."

07:21.441 --> 07:23.176
Yeah, count me in.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.846
I'll set you up with
FBI servers and our
best computer guy.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.048
We I.D. these guys,
and with your local knowledge,

07:28.115 --> 07:29.517
we can scoop
these guys up faster.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.684
Okay.
Whoever was behind
that swatting call

07:30.751 --> 07:32.185
knew Baty was dangerous.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.654
A friend or neighbor
who wanted to tip us off

07:33.721 --> 07:35.789
without opening themselves
up to retaliation by Baty?

07:35.856 --> 07:37.925
FBI's dealt with
swatting calls before.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.059
They're difficult to trace.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.662
Let me know
if you need our resources.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.396
Gines.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.499
I want to be in that room
when you question Baty.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.000
Be my guest.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.639
HONDO: Deac, Luca,

07:51.705 --> 07:53.607
I need a favor.
Sure, Hondo, what's up?

07:53.674 --> 07:55.943
You guys still play ball
with that watch commander
out of the Southwest Division?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.077
Lieutenant Bernard. Yeah.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.411
Big mouth, no jump shot.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.447
Yeah, my dad was
his training officer.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.383
I need you to give him a call,
and get a uni to locate
someone in South L.A. for me.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.118
Sure, who?
My father.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.254
I talked to him this morning,
he said he was headed
to Crenshaw

08:07.320 --> 08:09.422
to hang out with some
of his friends.
I tried his cell.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.258
He's not picking up.
All right, we're on it.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.726
No problem.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.667
GINES:
Christian Baty.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.935
Hey.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.572
Why is it always
boring-looking guys like you

08:24.638 --> 08:26.506
who turn out to be
the most dangerous?

08:26.574 --> 08:28.609
Are we really gonna
do this again, Agent?

08:28.676 --> 08:30.277
"Special Agent,"
and yeah, yeah, we are.

08:30.343 --> 08:34.081
Except this time,
I have bomb residue
and materials as evidence.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.383
Tell us what the target is
and who you're working with,

08:36.449 --> 08:38.852
maybe you won't go to prison
for the rest of your life.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.023
Do you play football?

08:45.325 --> 08:46.393
I used to.

08:46.459 --> 08:47.595
What position?

08:47.661 --> 08:48.729
Linebacker?
Halfback.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.163
But not quarterback, though.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.331
See, I...

08:51.398 --> 08:53.701
I care more about facts
than feelings.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.869
And here's a fact.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.337
Blacks can't
play quarterback.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.706
Not with the best
of them, anyway.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.608
Are you trying
to get a rise out of me?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.009
'Cause I've been there
and done that.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.744
Eh, just my way
of connecting.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.112
You know, I grew up
in South L.A.,

09:05.178 --> 09:06.546
one of the neighborhoods
on your list,

09:06.614 --> 09:08.115
and there's a lot
of good people who live there.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.917
Really?

09:09.983 --> 09:13.120
Do you have any idea
what's going on in your hood?

09:13.186 --> 09:15.255
There are black armies
on street corners

09:15.322 --> 09:17.625
chanting to put
"wings on white pigs."

09:17.691 --> 09:19.593
You're saying someone's
looking to kill cops there?

09:19.660 --> 09:21.729
BATY: I pay attention
to what's going on.

09:21.795 --> 09:25.432
There are hate groups
plotting the assassination
of white police officers.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.467
What the hell
are you talking about?
Exactly.

09:27.534 --> 09:31.471
How is it that I know
more about what's going on
in this city than you do?

09:31.538 --> 09:33.040
In your own communities?

09:33.106 --> 09:36.109
Why do you leave it up to
me to protect other cops?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.178
Let's sit you down
and see what you got to say.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.486
Did you hear any chatter
on the streets about
someone going after cops?

09:46.553 --> 09:48.455
No. Nothing I've heard.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.823
He's probably just
wasting our time.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.759
I don't know.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.961
He seemed like
he was feeling it.

09:54.027 --> 09:57.097
Let's give a heads-up to
Southwest and 77th Divisions.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.799
We dig deeper,
we'll find out his target.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.567
All right. I'm on it.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.574
Our swatting call
was made using a deaf
teletype relay service.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.242
The hard of hearing use them.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.544
To turn typed messages
into voice messages.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.547
Prevents us from I.D.'ing
the caller's voice.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.017
But these services aren't as
anonymous as you might think.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.385
We traced the call
through dispatch.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.954
Our swatter tried to mask
his location by connecting

10:21.021 --> 10:23.791
to a non-emergency line
before transferring to 911,

10:23.857 --> 10:25.425
but I focused on the signal,

10:25.492 --> 10:27.961
found the physical address,
an apartment in Echo Park.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.629
I want unis there now.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.939
Did you know Commissioner
Plank was stepping down
to run for governor?

10:39.673 --> 10:41.208
CORTEZ: No.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.409
Hey, Annie,
what are you doing here?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.244
I was just on my way home
from a doctor's visit,

10:44.311 --> 10:46.914
and guess who just
got a totally clean
bill of health.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.048
Are you serious?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.350
Brain scan, blood test,
all checked out.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.019
No more worries about tumors.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.521
I guess you're stuck with me
a little while longer.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.757
Oh, my goodness.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.425
All your hard work,
all the rehab.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.928
Well, I could not
have done it without you.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.195
Hey, I know you're busy.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.065
I just wanted
to tell you in person.
And kiss you.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.768
And tell you I love you.
Love you, too.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.369
LUCA: Annie!

11:09.436 --> 11:11.071
Hey, Luca.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.740
Bye, Luca.
What's up?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.742
Hey, how's the rehab going?

11:14.808 --> 11:16.309
She's got
a clean bill of health.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.278
Deac! That's awesome, man.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.080
Yeah, it's a blessing.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.481
We got to celebrate.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.050
Sure thing, man.
What did you have
in mind?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.217
Well, I'm thinking
I got to come up

11:24.284 --> 11:26.253
with a really big surprise
for Annie.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.021
Dude, Annie always sniffs
out your surprises.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.522
Not this time.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.026
Sorry. It's my mom's
first day at work,

11:33.093 --> 11:34.261
and she's kind of
freaking out.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.764
At least she knows how
to use her phone now.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.931
What's her job?

11:37.998 --> 11:39.900
I found this opening
at this deli.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.301
They hire parolees.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.671
Bunch of hard ex-cons
and my mom selling sandwiches.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.574
I can't imagine it's easy
starting a new life
with a past like hers.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.810
It's just a little different
than I expected.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.879
You know, I got to...
I got to grocery shop

11:51.945 --> 11:53.747
so we can fix breakfast
together, and then I...

11:53.814 --> 11:56.049
I got to try and
get home in time
to set the dinner table.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.451
It's like she's still on
this prison schedule,
you know?

11:58.518 --> 11:59.787
Our little boy's growing up.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.222
Let's not
get carried away.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.057
Ran your parameters
through our database.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.760
Came up with fellow chat room
buddies of your suspect.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.361
Connor Glenski.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.697
Used to affiliate
with local white pride
groups in Fontana.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.766
I got two more.
Jacob Sullivan from Wyoming

12:12.833 --> 12:14.968
and Garrett Logan
from Virginia.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.636
How'd you find them so fast?
We're the FBI.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.273
We've got equipment and
algorithms locals can't touch.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.541
Don't got
one of those, though.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.777
Sweet jacket.
Got any for sale?

12:23.844 --> 12:27.247
After you finish with this,
I'll see if I can scrounge
one up.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.316
I'm gonna get these names
to Agent Gines.
Excuse me.

12:32.519 --> 12:33.720
Mom?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.655
Jimmy, I need you
here right now.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.158
What's wrong?
Your Uncle Ralph is here.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.127
Mom, Uncle Ralph
lives in Phoenix.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.361
I mean,
we haven't seen him since...

12:41.428 --> 12:43.430
I know, since...
Since after the funeral.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.332
But he's here. Now.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.300
I think he wants to hurt me.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.601
Are you sure it's him?

12:48.668 --> 12:50.637
I mean, it's been 20 years
since you've seen him.

12:50.703 --> 12:55.508
It's him. You remember
how angry he was
after your father died?

12:55.575 --> 12:58.846
And... And how he talked
about getting back at me
if he ever had the chance?

12:58.912 --> 13:00.447
Ma, hey. Just take a breath.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.681
Okay? Take a breath.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.383
I don't know what
he wants to do to me.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.751
Just come down here, please.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.119
We're in the middle
of a case.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.921
Okay... Okay.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.156
I understand.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.191
I'm sorry,
I'm... I'm just scared.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.093
Mom. Mom?

13:15.662 --> 13:17.130
I've updated Gines.
Let's go.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.199
Actually, Chris...

13:19.266 --> 13:21.368
Take the Charger, head
back to HQ without me.
All right, funny guy.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.003
Come on.
I know it sounds crazy,

13:23.070 --> 13:25.038
but I got an emergency.
I got...
I'll meet up with you later.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.940
What?
I can't argue right now.
I just got to go.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.376
Hell you do. What am I
supposed to tell Hondo?

13:29.442 --> 13:31.678
I covered for you going AWOL
before, and I got burned.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.680
I know, I... You don't
have to say a word
to Hondo, okay?

13:33.746 --> 13:34.781
I'm gonna talk to him.
Okay.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.549
How do you know
she's not playing you again?

13:36.616 --> 13:39.186
Who?
Come on, don't put
me in this position.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.221
Look, I said I was gonna
talk to Hondo, okay?

13:41.288 --> 13:42.956
It's not on you.
I'm gonna take care of it.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.895
Street.

13:47.961 --> 13:48.962
STREET: Hondo,
we got the names

13:49.029 --> 13:50.130
of Baty's accomplices.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.431
HONDO: Yeah,
I just talked to Gines.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.900
We're looking into it.
STREET: Great.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.903
Chris is on her way back
to HQ now with the intel.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.704
Listen, I got to make
a quick detour, though.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.907
You remember the arrest I made
on that gunrunner in Palmdale?

13:59.973 --> 14:01.508
Yeah. Yeah, what's going on?

14:03.410 --> 14:06.346
Well, uh, I got
an on-call subpoena for it.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.416
And, uh, D.A. needs me
to appear in court
in, like, 30 minutes.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.051
Listen, uh, I'm gonna
split off to respond,

14:11.118 --> 14:12.886
but I should be back
in time to, uh...

14:12.953 --> 14:14.454
I should be back in time
to move on these guys.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.289
All right. Roger that.
Thanks.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.665
I got him from here.
Thanks.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.300
Wow.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.701
I live my whole life right.

14:28.768 --> 14:31.104
I ain't been
in a police station
over 45 years,

14:31.171 --> 14:33.006
and it takes my son
to have me arrested?

14:33.073 --> 14:34.841
Okay, look here, ain't
nobody arresting you, Pop.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.644
I thought we agreed
that you would keep us updated
on where you would be.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.212
What, like I'm
12 years old?
No.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.081
Like you have a
medical condition
that can be a problem

14:41.148 --> 14:42.649
if you don't stay
on top of it.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.584
That was the point of
moving you to L.A.,

14:44.651 --> 14:46.119
so me and Brie could
be here for you.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.255
Look, I was down on Crenshaw
looking after Ms. Reginald.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.924
See, there's this guy
that keeps coming
around her neighborhood,

14:50.991 --> 14:53.026
and, well, she just wants
somebody to look out for her,
that's all.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.595
Oh, right.
You is that someone,
huh? Come on, man.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.764
This ain't got nothing to do
with her being single, huh?

14:57.830 --> 14:59.232
I've been gone for 30 years.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.401
I'm just reconnecting
with my community, that's all.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.136
Okay, well, you can reconnect
with your community

15:03.203 --> 15:04.637
by letting people
like Ms. Reginald know

15:04.704 --> 15:06.439
she can call the cops
if she got a problem.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.774
It ain't that simple
for some people.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.410
Oh, here we go.
Black versus blue, right?

15:10.477 --> 15:12.045
I've been telling you
since I was a kid

15:12.112 --> 15:13.280
it ain't got to
be like that.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.814
You're the one who told
me that if I wanted

15:14.881 --> 15:16.449
to do something
about the police,
I should join them.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.686
Yeah, but I was just
making a point about futility.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.054
Ain't nobody with any sense

15:21.121 --> 15:23.957
expected you
to actually start
wearing a badge.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.459
All right, I ain't gonna
do this right now, Pop.
We can talk about it later.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.328
All right, come on.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.997
Look, our counselor
has a couch and a TV.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.264
You can post up
there for now.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.367
Hondo, I know you.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.436
And I know when
something's wrong.
What's really going on?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.040
All right, real talk?

15:40.107 --> 15:42.009
There's a bomb
threat in South L.A.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.643
We're trying to locate
it and shut it down.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.612
And you want me
out of harm's way?
That's right.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.081
What about
the other people, son?
That just don't seem fair.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.850
We got cops all over
the neighborhood trying
to find these suspects.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.053
Listen, I was born and raised
there, and so were you.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.223
I can't just
sit here on my ass
if it's in danger.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.458
Pop, will you let me
do my job?

15:58.525 --> 16:00.994
I can't do that if
I'm worried about you.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.929
It is my turn to take
care of this community.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.701
Officer. Get him set up
in the counselor's office,
all right?

16:08.768 --> 16:10.070
Mmm-hmm.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.178
We checked our swatter's
apartment in Echo Park.
No one lives there.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.380
I was afraid of that.
It's a dead end.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.514
Not quite.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.583
We looked into
the apartment's lease history.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.252
TAN: Last one was a
long-term agreement,

16:25.318 --> 16:27.220
but no one remembers
what the tenant looked like.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.488
Well, he must have kept
a low profile.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.856
CORTEZ: Made us look closer.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.525
Boring location,
lots of exits,
and a bathroom

16:32.592 --> 16:34.394
perfect to use as a darkroom.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.363
Sounds like a safe house.
I made some calls.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.266
It was a safe house.
For the FBI.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.102
I also looked into you.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.670
Your daughter
has a friend who's deaf

16:43.736 --> 16:46.606
and uses the same
relay service
our swatter used.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.008
You made that 911 call.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.581
What else are you hiding?

17:00.820 --> 17:03.923
The more I dug into Baty,
the more I knew
how dangerous he was.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.458
Now, I went to my superiors.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.794
I even went to the higher-ups
in the Justice Department.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.329
No one thought
we had enough for a warrant.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.064
No one took it seriously.

17:11.131 --> 17:14.234
So you used S.W.A.T.
to get inside Baty's house
to uncover his plan?

17:14.301 --> 17:17.737
That stunt could have led
to my guys killing people
under false pretenses.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.406
And you know what
I'm talking about.

17:21.007 --> 17:24.144
How many people are gonna die
if Baty isn't stopped?

17:24.211 --> 17:27.680
Now, we all know
his accomplice is gonna do
something today, right?

17:29.616 --> 17:32.319
So who are we
going after here?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.587
Now, you could spend your time
digging into me,

17:34.654 --> 17:36.789
trying to prove
I made that call.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.259
Or you could focus
on stopping this attack.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.729
Agent Gines.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.264
Could you excuse us, please?

17:47.334 --> 17:48.668
Stay in the building.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.176
Anything we found
in Baty's house

17:56.243 --> 17:57.910
can't be used in court.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.446
Well, it leaves us
two choices.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.114
Maintain
plausible deniability,

18:01.181 --> 18:02.615
keep it under wraps
for a few hours,

18:02.682 --> 18:06.686
which makes us complicit
in a cover-up with the FBI.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.155
Or release Baty
back on the street.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.623
Hold up, hold up.
Release Baty?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.125
We know he's been making
explosives.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.394
He's got accomplices out
there ready to use them.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.963
And it was an illegal search.

18:19.732 --> 18:20.833
Hmm.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.776
Are we just gonna
let this clown walk?

18:29.842 --> 18:30.977
Yeah, what's
the word, Hondo?

18:31.043 --> 18:33.180
We're letting him walk,
we're not letting him go.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.782
We're gonna roll with Baty,
and we're gonna watch
his every move.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.517
I called in a few favors
with some outsiders

18:37.584 --> 18:39.219
who're gonna help us
keep an eye on him.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.853
You think Baty's gonna
lead us to his accomplices?

18:40.920 --> 18:43.856
Heard you're a man down,
so Rocker and I agreed
to chip in.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.493
We're upgrades, honestly.
Appreciate that.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.060
All right, load up.
Let's get ready to move out.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.729
LUCA: Let's go.
HONDO: Chris,
hold on a second.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.131
You and I got to talk
about Street.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.801
I called the D.A.
He never got subpoenaed.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.204
Subpoenaed?
Where the hell
is he, Chris?

18:57.270 --> 18:58.438
What did he tell you?

18:58.505 --> 18:59.872
That he needed to
appear in court.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.409
Only his case was never
on the books for today.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.445
I'm sorry, boss. I assumed
you knew what was going on.
I...

19:05.512 --> 19:08.381
He swore to me he was
gonna call you right away
and tell you the truth.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.982
What is the truth, Chris?

19:10.049 --> 19:11.551
He didn't say exactly yet.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.354
Just think there's
some kind of drama
going on with his mom.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.760
Ma.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.029
Hey.
Oh, Jimmy. Oh!

19:23.095 --> 19:24.464
Hey, it's okay.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.633
It's all right. I'm here.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.067
I didn't mean
to ruin your day at work.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.270
I know how important
work is for you.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.905
Ma, take breaths, okay?
Take deep breaths.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.007
Okay.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.579
Drea's gonna let you sit
for a couple minutes.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.080
Everything's cool, okay?

19:41.147 --> 19:42.649
Okay.
All right, just relax.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.083
Okay. Okay.
Relax.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.255
Where is he?
Who?

19:48.321 --> 19:50.122
The guy my mom thinks
is my Uncle Ralph.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.406
Jimmy.

20:09.141 --> 20:10.377
You grew up big.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.447
I got Baty
in a Code 37 plate number.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.949
John, Adam, Nine,
Edward, Three, David,

20:17.016 --> 20:18.285
headed south on Crenshaw.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.453
Deacon, Luca,
keep a perimeter to the north.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.588
We're in position, Hondo.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.955
Chris, keep a perimeter
to the south.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.757
Mumford and Rocker
to the west.
On it.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.326
Looks like Baty's
heading into South L.A.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.227
This guy gets released,
and the first place
he heads for

20:28.295 --> 20:29.462
is the neighborhood
he's targeting?

20:29.529 --> 20:31.097
I had him and his
car searched at HQ.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.365
No guns or explosives.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.667
But he could be meeting
with the people who have them.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.369
Eyes peeled, people.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.248
Think we just got made.

20:49.316 --> 20:52.419
Good. I want Baty
to think he's smarter than us.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.220
That's why I called in favors.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.727
HONDO:
All right, Little Red.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.029
You sure you're up for this?
Depends, Hondo.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.332
You gonna talk to that D.A.
about my possession charge?

21:05.398 --> 21:07.634
And don't pull one of them
cop tricks like last time.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.537
Look, man, a deal's a deal,
assuming you and your boys
don't lose this guy.

21:12.639 --> 21:16.042
Look, you see anything,
you text us, and we'll handle
it from there, you understand?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.209
Mmm-hmm.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.348
Guy is definitely not
from around here.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.749
More like the North Pole.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.917
How dangerous is he?

21:24.984 --> 21:26.586
Too dangerous to
talk about, Red.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.656
Wait, you serious?

21:29.722 --> 21:31.157
Welcome to my world.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.892
How's it feel to be working
with the good guys?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.561
Jury's still out on that.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.131
STREET: Hey.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.701
How'd you find Mom?

21:41.768 --> 21:44.771
When lowlife murderers
are released from prison,

21:44.837 --> 21:47.507
the parole board notifies
the families of their victims.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.208
It wasn't hard to
track her down.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.844
Why are you here?
To collect family property.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.614
Your mom has a necklace
that belonged to my mother.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.782
Antique gold.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.049
Ma, go back inside.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.386
This necklace
is not yours.
Shh.

21:59.452 --> 22:02.522
You kept it as some
kind of sick trophy
after killing my brother!

22:02.589 --> 22:03.790
No, I earned
this necklace

22:03.856 --> 22:05.758
after all the beatings
I took from him!

22:05.825 --> 22:07.159
Is that right?
Hey. Hey! Hey.

22:07.226 --> 22:09.161
You're not stepping to my mom,
Ralph. Not happening.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.063
All right, all right,
I... I don't want trouble.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.799
I just want what's right.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.167
That necklace belongs to her.
Her mother gave it to her.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.169
Take a look at the
engraving on the back.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.079
So he's telling
the truth?

22:27.146 --> 22:29.348
Your Grandma Jeanie
gave it to me, Jimmy.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.751
Before you killed her son
in cold blood.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.186
Your brother
was a violent son of a bitch

22:34.253 --> 22:37.189
who would've killed me
and Jimmy both
if I hadn't shot him!

22:37.256 --> 22:39.992
Shh! Enough, enough.
Both of you, stop it.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.794
Give it to me.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.664
Give it to me.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.608
Take it.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.611
I told myself I was
coming here for this.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.847
But if I'm being honest,

23:00.913 --> 23:02.549
I wanted to look
you in the face

23:02.615 --> 23:05.752
and say you're an evil bitch
who's going to hell one day.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.087
Hey.

23:08.154 --> 23:12.091
My father, he was
the worst thing that
ever happened to me.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.761
So you take your necklace,
and go back to Arizona,

23:14.827 --> 23:16.596
and you do not come near
my mother again.

23:16.663 --> 23:19.165
Or what?
You gonna shoot me?

23:19.231 --> 23:20.800
I thought
that was her job.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.603
Go. Now.

23:23.670 --> 23:27.139
You only remember things
the way she wants you
to remember them.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.575
But her and your daddy,

23:28.641 --> 23:30.677
they went after
each other. I saw it.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.944
I saw it.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.413
Leave. Leave.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.349
Good luck to you, Jimmy.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.594
Hey, man.
You alone?

23:47.660 --> 23:49.228
Yeah. Just drove past.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.531
GLENSKI: Yeah, I think
I'm good, too.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.802
Hondo, check this out.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.369
HONDO: Listen up,

23:57.436 --> 23:59.639
Baty's with Connor Glenski,
one of his known associates.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.307
Glenski's got a backpack
and may be armed.

24:01.373 --> 24:02.775
Roll with caution.
DEACON: Roger that.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.410
On our way.
On my way.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.350
Some guy is taking
pictures of us.

24:11.417 --> 24:12.685
Over to the right?
Yeah.

24:12.752 --> 24:13.853
All right, let's get going.
Yeah.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.121
Let's go.
Go, go, go, go.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.529
HONDO: L.A.P.D.!
Get off the bike!

24:22.595 --> 24:24.230
TAN: Stop! L.A.P.D.!

24:24.296 --> 24:25.565
Stop!

24:29.268 --> 24:30.737
Glenski's on a black bike,
headed west.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.111
Off the bike,
on the ground!

24:39.178 --> 24:40.813
Off the bike now!

24:40.880 --> 24:42.181
Watch the crossfire!

24:44.350 --> 24:45.351
LUCA: Get off the bike!

25:04.303 --> 25:06.906
Little Red and his boys
lost eyes on Baty
during the explosion.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.374
There's not much
left of Glenski.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.742
I talked to the Bomb Squad,

25:09.809 --> 25:11.844
and the explosives in
his backpack are made of TATP.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.980
Matches the residue
from Baty's house.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.848
That combo's easy to make
if you know what you're doing.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.884
And it's known for
accidental detonation.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.852
That's just one device.
If Baty and his friends
have more,

25:19.919 --> 25:21.453
we got a serious problem.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.623
Speaking of Baty's friends,
credit card receipts
for Sullivan and Logan

25:23.690 --> 25:26.258
show they bought plane tickets
to LAX yesterday.
They're in town.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.860
No hits
on the BOLO search yet.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.796
Deac and I are still
looking into Baty's claims

25:29.862 --> 25:31.998
about cops being targets.
So far, nothing.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.700
Got to find these
guys, quick.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.402
Keep grinding.
We're running out of time.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.204
LUCA: Say, Hondo,

25:38.270 --> 25:40.873
I thought you should know,
I saw your dad leaving HQ
a few minutes ago.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.409
What? I told him to stay
in Wendy's office until
the end of the day.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.411
I tried to stop him,
but I guess he doesn't
like being told.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.747
'Cause he said something
about not wanting to be

25:47.814 --> 25:49.348
on the sidelines
while people need help.

25:49.415 --> 25:51.918
Thanks, Luca.
Mmm-hmm.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.586
MUMFORD: Hey, Deac.

25:53.653 --> 25:56.255
What's this I hear
about a surprise
celebration for Annie?

25:56.322 --> 25:57.757
Putting something
together, yeah.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.826
Well, you know, since Nikki
and I eloped to Vegas,

25:59.892 --> 26:02.494
I got these vendors
locked in we didn't use.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.496
Maybe you want to
split the costs, you know?

26:04.563 --> 26:07.433
Save some cash if you need
a flower guy or a cake.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.802
Yeah. I mean, I'm putting it
together on the fly, so...

26:09.869 --> 26:12.471
Great. So you got
anybody to officiate?

26:12.538 --> 26:15.107
'Cause you know who's
licensed in California...

26:22.982 --> 26:24.984
I came to apologize.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.687
I didn't mean for you
to find out about my campaign
through a press conference.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.789
I put myself on the line
with those proposals

26:29.856 --> 26:31.958
because you said
you would protect me.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.993
Now there's gonna be
a target on my back.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.995
Listen, I'm a long shot
to win the governor's seat.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.697
But if I do, there'll be
incredible opportunities

26:37.764 --> 26:39.198
for you to expand
your work.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.168
I'm sorry about this.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.503
Things moved faster
than I anticipated.

26:44.570 --> 26:46.973
Really? I looked up
your website.

26:47.039 --> 26:51.377
MichaelPlankForGovernor.com
was reserved five months ago,

26:51.443 --> 26:54.681
before we even went public
with the police reforms.

26:54.747 --> 26:57.483
You were using my work
to set you up for this.

26:57.549 --> 26:58.584
Listen, that's politics.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.419
Of course there was
a benefit for me.

27:00.486 --> 27:01.954
But the reforms are off
to a great start,

27:02.021 --> 27:03.522
and you're here to make sure
they stay on track.

27:03.589 --> 27:04.824
I have
an opportunity now

27:04.891 --> 27:07.126
to implement them
all across the state.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.962
If I succeed, you'll have
a powerful ally.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.665
And if you don't, people
are gonna come after my job.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.068
I'm gonna tell you a secret,
Jessica.

27:17.904 --> 27:21.573
You never needed me
to protect you
or to do any of this.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.975
You got this.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.719
STREET: Just got back.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.220
What's going on?
Where do you need me?

27:34.286 --> 27:36.856
How'd your testimony go?
You gonna put the guy away?

27:36.923 --> 27:39.591
False alarm. Turns out
I wasn't needed.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.294
Hey, boss.
A, uh, motel manager
in Inglewood recognized

27:42.361 --> 27:44.163
Jacob Sullivan
and Garrett Logan.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.165
Said they
rented out rooms.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.567
Unis went in, but all
they found were research books
on Crenshaw and Micheaux Park.

27:48.634 --> 27:49.736
That narrows down
the target area.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.038
Hey, you got
to see this.
Come here.

27:52.104 --> 27:55.174
This might make Baty's words
make more sense.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.211
So, it's a video of
a community group,
the Young Slausons,

27:59.278 --> 28:03.049
in South L.A. They're chanting
to kill white cops
and put "wings on pigs."

28:03.115 --> 28:04.884
CHRIS: Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

28:04.951 --> 28:07.053
So Baty was right?

28:07.119 --> 28:08.788
Yes and no.
No, it's totally fake.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.522
It's a bunch of clips
edited together,

28:10.589 --> 28:14.026
taken out of context.
The website for this video
didn't check out.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.728
There are fake articles,
misspellings

28:15.795 --> 28:18.630
The video was posted
out of Crimea.
It's a troll farm.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.466
Yeah, it's people
looking to take
advantage of fear,

28:20.532 --> 28:22.368
start violence in U.S. cities.

28:22.434 --> 28:25.604
Problem is, an online
conspiracy theorist on YouTube
picked it up last month,

28:25.671 --> 28:27.206
then bots on Twitter
started pushing it.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.075
Like gas on the fire.
See, Baty and his friends

28:29.141 --> 28:30.476
think that they're
actually protecting cops

28:30.542 --> 28:31.878
by trying to kill
Young Slausons,

28:31.944 --> 28:33.045
but it's all
based on a hoax.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.713
Micheaux Park.

28:34.781 --> 28:37.249
There's a celebration today,
and all the Young Slausons
are gonna be there,

28:37.316 --> 28:38.450
along with hundreds
of people.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.819
Probably my pops, too.

28:39.886 --> 28:40.920
What?

28:40.987 --> 28:42.188
Let's move.

28:45.858 --> 28:48.594
* Transforming global markets
with all of my partners

28:48.660 --> 28:51.530
* Methodical corporate culture
straight out the projects

28:51.597 --> 28:53.465
* What's the ingredients
to the realest?

28:53.532 --> 28:56.002
* Place two cups of cranberry
in the skillet

28:56.068 --> 28:58.104
* A half a cup of water,
add some Henny... *

29:03.075 --> 29:04.176
Hondo.
Pop,

29:04.243 --> 29:05.544
are you in Micheaux Park?

29:05.611 --> 29:07.146
You know it.
Okay, listen to me.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.515
That attack
I was talking about
is going down there soon.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.451
Look, son, now, if you're
asking me to leave...

29:12.518 --> 29:14.887
I'm not, Pop, I'm not.
I need you to help
evacuate people

29:14.954 --> 29:16.956
before we get there,
quietly, without panic.

29:17.023 --> 29:18.324
Can you do that?

29:18.390 --> 29:19.758
Son, I got this.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.294
V.O.C.!

29:22.361 --> 29:24.496
We got us
a situation to handle.

29:34.206 --> 29:35.908
All right, let's get these
people cleared out of here.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.376
My team's gonna take
the north end.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.145
Mumford, Rocker, you go south.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.512
LUCA: Let's go, everyone!

29:40.579 --> 29:42.648
DEACON: People, we need you
to get out of this park!

29:42.714 --> 29:44.583
Keep moving. Keep moving.
LUCA: Let's go!

29:44.650 --> 29:46.919
HONDO: We need you to move
to the front now.
People, you got to move!

29:48.220 --> 29:49.355
You need to move out
of the park!

29:49.421 --> 29:50.890
Move to the front!
Exit that way.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.391
MUMFORD: Everybody,
move out of the park!

29:52.458 --> 29:54.493
CHRIS: Keep moving!
Everybody move!

29:54.560 --> 29:56.996
Out of the park,
to the front! Pop.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.404
We got eyes on that?

30:05.471 --> 30:07.840
Neither bomb was set off
in a heavily populated area.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.075
There are no casualties.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.081
LUCA: Move!

30:17.749 --> 30:19.718
Get out of here, Pop.
Move. Get out of here.
All right.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.857
Go!
Please, come on, move out.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.563
These bombs
weren't meant to kill.

30:31.630 --> 30:35.401
These are smaller ones herding
people to the bigger bomb
inside that truck!

30:35.467 --> 30:39.038
Get patrol and make a wall!
Keep people away from that
truck!

30:39.105 --> 30:40.606
Move!
This way!

30:40.672 --> 30:41.874
Away from the truck!

30:44.443 --> 30:45.711
Get away from the truck!

30:47.613 --> 30:48.614
STREET: Get away
from that truck.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.681
Go!

30:52.885 --> 30:56.188
Keep moving.
Go! Move, move, move! Move!

30:56.255 --> 30:57.556
HONDO:
Everybody move out the front!

30:57.623 --> 30:58.657
Do not go near that truck!

30:58.724 --> 30:59.959
Move, move! Exit!
This way!

31:03.429 --> 31:04.463
Hey, girls.
Come here, come here.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.631
I'm gonna take you
to Mom, okay?

31:07.466 --> 31:09.001
Here we go, here we go.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.769
Move, move!

31:10.836 --> 31:12.804
Come on, let's go!
Move, move!

31:18.010 --> 31:19.745
CHRIS: Over there!
Those are Baty's guys.

31:19.811 --> 31:21.113
Hey! Keep your hands up!

31:21.180 --> 31:24.016
Hands behind your back!
Now! Now!

31:24.083 --> 31:25.584
Got it!

31:25.651 --> 31:27.486
* *

31:33.325 --> 31:34.460
Hondo!

31:37.930 --> 31:40.699
Baty's got the truck.
Get me the MRAP.
Street, let's go.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.568
Get out of the way!
Out of the way!
Move, move, move!

31:56.115 --> 31:57.950
That truck's a sensitive bomb.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.486
Could detonate at any second
and take out half a block.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.492
CORTEZ: Hondo, you have to
steer it away from civilians
right now.

32:06.558 --> 32:07.659
We're parallel with him now.

32:11.197 --> 32:13.765
I want barricades set up
on Main moving north.

32:42.328 --> 32:45.197
He's heading west
through a parking lot
straight for civilians.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.199
HICKS: Hondo, he's headed
for a busy farmer's market

32:47.266 --> 32:48.800
on the other side of that lot.
Yeah, I got him.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.469
Street, are we clear?
Right side clear!

32:57.309 --> 32:59.278
Hondo, Hondo, we're not gonna
be able to cut him off!

32:59.345 --> 33:00.579
That's not
the plan, Street.

33:08.254 --> 33:09.288
Brace yourself!

33:27.973 --> 33:29.675
Command to 20-David.
Are you there?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.228
This is 20-David
to Command.

33:50.629 --> 33:51.863
We're good.

34:08.314 --> 34:09.315
I came as soon as I heard.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.016
Oh, my gosh.
I'm okay.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.251
Dad and you could have
been hurt.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.186
I'm okay.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.887
You sure?
Yeah.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.356
Okay.

34:17.423 --> 34:20.025
Hondo, thank you.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.960
You're always welcome.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.999
Same Ms. Reginald who wouldn't
call the cops, huh?

34:28.066 --> 34:30.369
Yeah.

34:30.436 --> 34:33.605
Thanks for your help
today, Pop.
Oh.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.574
Guess you might have to
rethink this black versus blue
thing.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.176
It is what it is, son.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.846
But I saw
what you did today.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.616
As for me, I'm...

34:44.683 --> 34:46.518
I was just being
my son's father.

34:51.523 --> 34:52.991
Let's go, Brie.

34:54.226 --> 34:56.695
This is my daughter,
Brianna...

35:02.401 --> 35:03.635
Hey.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.339
I, uh,

35:07.406 --> 35:09.208
heard about Plank.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.343
Oh.
So what's your next move?

35:11.410 --> 35:13.945
Things could get rocky.
I hear the new commission
president

35:14.012 --> 35:15.781
isn't a fan of me
or my ideas.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.583
Well, you're not alone, Jess.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.351
Me and my team
got your back.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.553
I appreciate that.
Mmm-hmm.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.322
I got your message
about Street.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.891
Yeah. And?

35:25.957 --> 35:28.527
You're team leader.
It's up to you.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.229
And I support
whatever that is.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.736
Hondo?

35:38.404 --> 35:40.406
You know David Arias?

35:40.472 --> 35:42.208
Works for the city
trade commission.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.176
No.

35:44.243 --> 35:47.746
We both do charity work for
the Boys & Girls Club of L.A.

35:47.813 --> 35:51.683
I've seen him at a couple
recent functions, and, um,

35:51.750 --> 35:53.219
he asked me out on a date.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.922
Well, he sounds like
a smart guy.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.828
You and I are not
leaving S.W.A.T.
anytime soon.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.464
I'm still your boss,
there's still rules.

36:05.531 --> 36:10.602
And I thought it was time
for me... Us, uh...

36:10.669 --> 36:12.604
I don't know why I feel like
I have to tell you this.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.907
Okay, Jess, Jess, we both know
why you're telling me this.

36:17.376 --> 36:20.246
You deserve any happiness
that comes your way.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.647
You, too.

36:23.148 --> 36:24.450
Thanks.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.286
Mmm-hmm.
Hope he's ready.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.504
You wanted
to see me?

36:49.875 --> 36:51.042
All right.

36:52.143 --> 36:55.614
I figure
you probably already know,

36:55.681 --> 36:57.115
but I lied.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.951
I lied about being needed
in court,

37:00.018 --> 37:02.654
'cause I didn't
know what else
to do, Hondo.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.357
My mom was in danger.
For real, man.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.158
That's what you should
have told me, Street.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.495
But I know how
you feel about her.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.630
She okay?

37:11.697 --> 37:13.332
Yeah, she is now.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.301
Good. I mean that.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.435
Thanks.

37:17.303 --> 37:18.670
But you're off S.W.A.T.

37:18.737 --> 37:19.838
What?

37:20.372 --> 37:21.473
Okay.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.975
Hondo, listen,
please don't do this, okay?

37:24.042 --> 37:26.445
You're not leaving me
any choice here, Street.

37:26.512 --> 37:28.914
You report to patrol duty
tomorrow.
Okay.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.283
Listen, I'm sorry, all right?

37:31.350 --> 37:32.851
I screwed up.
I... I know that,

37:32.918 --> 37:34.085
and I take
full responsibility...

37:34.152 --> 37:36.322
You violated the trust
of your teammates,

37:36.388 --> 37:38.424
your commanding officer
and this city.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.258
Is that really what
this is about, or is it
about my mom?

37:40.326 --> 37:43.329
Don't do that.
Don't even go there.
I'm leaving you in Metro.

37:43.395 --> 37:46.698
Any other team leader
would ship your ass off
to some corner of the city.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.734
You want
to take full responsibility?

37:48.800 --> 37:50.369
Then you get ready
for your next assignment.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.371
Hondo, this is not
how this ends!

37:52.438 --> 37:54.906
Hey, don't turn
your back on me, man.
I'm still talking to you!

37:56.775 --> 37:58.510
Right now you're off S.W.A.T.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.512
You want to stop being a cop,
you keep pushing it!

38:00.579 --> 38:03.349
Hondo, maybe he was
just trying...
Okay, you better be careful.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.317
You were with him
both times he pulled
this stunt.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.652
You know, when I
first joined this team,

38:06.718 --> 38:08.820
you told me that
it was a family.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.556
You don't kick people
out of a family!

38:12.524 --> 38:15.427
I made a promise to Buck
to show you the right way.

38:16.462 --> 38:17.729
It was my responsibility
to do that,

38:17.796 --> 38:19.164
and obviously, I failed it,

38:19.230 --> 38:21.032
and you.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.934
Now, I'm not giving up
on you, Street.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.870
But I wouldn't be doing you
or this team

38:24.936 --> 38:26.905
any favors
if I kept letting you slide.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.674
So maybe working uniform,

38:28.740 --> 38:31.242
you can learn things
I couldn't teach you.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.544
All right.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.114
I don't need this.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.251
I don't need you
or anybody else.

38:49.395 --> 38:50.962
Way to back me up
with Hondo.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.964
You mean lie to him?
No, I didn't.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.801
You didn't have to lie!
You said you were
gonna tell him the truth!

38:55.867 --> 38:58.069
All this time acting
like you're my friend.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.505
I am your friend.
Yeah.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.207
And you still have a choice.
I know Hondo.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.776
I know that he wants
there to be a way
for you back to S.W.A.T.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.512
But you can't be
burning that bridge.

39:06.578 --> 39:09.615
It isn't me
burning bridges, Chris.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.149
It's on you and Hondo.

39:21.527 --> 39:22.828
Hey, man.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.668
Maybe he'll still
show, Chris.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.804
Come on. You did
the right thing, boss.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.573
I mean, S.W.A.T. has
to stand for something.

39:34.640 --> 39:35.841
Maybe he needs this.

39:37.275 --> 39:38.444
Maybe he does.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.813
Oh. Okay, everybody.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.314
Uh, Cortez just texted,

39:43.381 --> 39:46.485
and she and Annie
are outside, so, uh, places.

39:51.289 --> 39:52.323
Hey, Deac?

40:02.300 --> 40:03.535
Hey, Mom.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.676
ALL: Surprise!

40:10.742 --> 40:13.612
Oh. Wow.

40:13.679 --> 40:16.815
What's going on?
You're kidding.
How did you know?

40:16.882 --> 40:18.450
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:18.517 --> 40:22.320
I had no idea
you wanted to celebrate
our wedding vows.

40:24.055 --> 40:25.757
Tried to warn you, Deac.
There's no pulling one over
on Annie.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.593
ANNIE: Uh-huh.
All right. Fair enough.

40:27.659 --> 40:28.760
But I got her this time.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.830
This isn't actually
my surprise.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.402
DEACON: Come on.

40:41.507 --> 40:44.242
* When the rain is blowing
in your face...

40:44.309 --> 40:47.613
Um, Annie... I love you.

40:47.679 --> 40:51.382
And I know how hard you
rehabbed to get better, so,

40:51.449 --> 40:55.186
I spoke to Cortez
and to Hicks.

40:55.253 --> 40:58.223
And since I've saved up
200 sick days,

40:58.289 --> 41:01.893
I've decided to use them
to stay home,
look after the kids.

41:03.895 --> 41:06.732
You have two semesters
left of law school,

41:06.798 --> 41:08.433
and it's the perfect
time to finish.

41:10.268 --> 41:13.471
* And the stars appear

41:13.539 --> 41:18.176
* And there is no one there
to dry your tears

41:19.878 --> 41:24.616
* I could hold you
for a million years...

41:26.552 --> 41:28.153
Just wait a minute.

41:29.921 --> 41:35.426
I truly appreciate this,
and everything you do, David,

41:35.493 --> 41:37.963
but I can't go back
to law school, babe.

41:38.029 --> 41:42.500
And I want you to know
that me quitting
was my choice.

41:42.568 --> 41:45.470
And the other reason,
actually...

41:47.438 --> 41:50.576
Not everything came up normal
in my checkup.

41:50.642 --> 41:56.281
* The storms are raging
on the rolling sea

41:56.347 --> 41:58.249
* And on the highway...

41:58.316 --> 41:59.417
You're pregnant?

41:59.484 --> 42:01.052
She's pregnant!

42:01.119 --> 42:03.254
What?
Again.

42:05.657 --> 42:08.426
Damn, Deac!
What kind of rehab
y'all been doing?

42:08.493 --> 42:10.796
That's how you
drop a surprise!

42:10.862 --> 42:12.097
Well, I guess
I got nothing to say.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.632
He's already kissing
the damn bride.

42:16.167 --> 42:22.007
* I could make you happy,
make your dreams come true

42:23.241 --> 42:27.545
* No, there's nothing
that I wouldn't do

42:29.480 --> 42:35.486
* Go to the ends
of the Earth for you

42:35.553 --> 42:41.526
* To make you feel my love *
