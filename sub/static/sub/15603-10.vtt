00:01.184 --> 00:02.590
<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:02.802 --> 00:05.699
I hope you take my candidacy
seriously, Senator Pierson.

00:05.771 --> 00:09.307
I'm sorry, but, um, I'm going
to have to recuse myself...

00:09.358 --> 00:10.341
My name is Arthur Campbell.

00:10.393 --> 00:11.893
I need a lawyer, Miss Manning.

00:11.977 --> 00:14.529
Why is Henry Wilcox meeting
with an A.L.C. terrorist?

00:14.613 --> 00:17.615
Turns out Calder's not working
for Henry after all.

00:17.683 --> 00:19.984
If you sabotage
that helicopter...

00:20.052 --> 00:22.070
I'm not gonna sabotage
anything.

00:22.154 --> 00:24.021
Teo's gonna do that.

00:30.045 --> 00:31.296
Teo, come on!

00:32.665 --> 00:33.748
Teo?

00:33.833 --> 00:34.833
He's lost a lot of blood.

00:34.884 --> 00:36.468
Prep room three
for surgery, stat.

00:36.535 --> 00:38.803
All right.

00:38.871 --> 00:41.973
Do you know that Henry
laid over in Frankfurt

00:42.040 --> 00:44.008
for 36 hours on his way
to Copenhagen?

00:44.059 --> 00:45.810
He must be meeting someone.

00:45.878 --> 00:48.646
I'm gonna find out who.

00:48.714 --> 00:50.715
I'm sorry.

01:01.193 --> 01:03.895
These allegations against
my client are patently false.

01:03.946 --> 01:06.614
Arthur Campbell is a patriot
and a hero.

01:13.539 --> 01:15.072
We have limited time.

01:15.124 --> 01:17.759
Arthur's being detained
for questioning by Justice.

01:17.843 --> 01:19.323
The A.G. is out for blood
on this one.

01:19.378 --> 01:21.463
It wasn't easy,
but I got you ten minutes.

01:21.547 --> 01:23.465
Go.

01:25.468 --> 01:28.686
Arthur.

01:33.142 --> 01:35.610
I love you.

01:35.694 --> 01:38.980
I love you too.

01:39.064 --> 01:41.533
I'm so sorry about Teo.

01:50.793 --> 01:52.944
We're gonna get you home.

01:59.785 --> 02:01.719
You briefed state?

02:01.787 --> 02:05.390
By the time I got there,
the secretary was stonewalling.

02:05.457 --> 02:06.624
News that Teo was your son

02:06.675 --> 02:08.235
had already reached
the Truman building.

02:08.293 --> 02:11.629
It's not good, Arthur.
The barbarians are at the gate.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.440
Did you find Annie?

02:13.465 --> 02:14.933
She left the base
at Schweinfurt.

02:14.984 --> 02:16.184
Not yet.

02:16.268 --> 02:18.186
BND and Interpol are combing
Germany looking for her.

02:18.270 --> 02:21.189
I've told them it's an agency
mission, but they won't listen.

02:21.273 --> 02:23.074
Copenhagen was
too big an event.

02:23.141 --> 02:25.193
Now exfiltration's
your best bet.

02:25.277 --> 02:26.277
Get her home.

02:26.328 --> 02:27.612
Exfil would be a good idea

02:27.663 --> 02:29.747
if she'd answer
our communication protocols.

02:29.815 --> 02:32.917
Well, she's scared
and determined.

02:32.985 --> 02:35.653
She's Annie.

02:35.704 --> 02:38.756
Bianca tells me Justice
is preparing legal action.

02:38.824 --> 02:41.175
She's advising me
to take a plea.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.293
Arthur--

02:42.344 --> 02:43.995
It'd keep the blowback
off of you.

02:44.046 --> 02:46.598
I can't have you in jeopardy.

02:46.665 --> 02:49.767
Our child deserves at least
one parent out of prison.

02:49.835 --> 02:53.221
He is going to have both.

02:53.305 --> 02:57.058
You said "he."

02:57.142 --> 02:59.060
I did.

03:04.033 --> 03:06.401
What happened to ten minutes?

03:09.572 --> 03:13.207
What is it?

03:13.292 --> 03:14.959
Senator Pierson's
in my office.

03:15.027 --> 03:16.828
She's demanding
a private meeting.

03:20.249 --> 03:22.750
The barbarians
are in the castle.

05:56.321 --> 06:02.243
International caller,
37-9376-242.

06:02.327 --> 06:04.629
Hey, I'll call you right back.

06:14.206 --> 06:15.706
Hey.

06:15.758 --> 06:17.875
- I need a way into Frankfurt.
- Where are you?

06:17.926 --> 06:20.377
Uh, in the main-Spessart
district just west of Karlstadt.

06:20.429 --> 06:23.514
- You found a car.
- Found is one way to put it.

06:23.565 --> 06:26.434
I guess you could say
I also found this phone.

06:26.518 --> 06:27.985
Well, you're going
to have to keep that up.

06:28.053 --> 06:31.222
No above-board transactions,
limited interactions.

06:31.273 --> 06:33.074
Burner phones
on a one-and-done basis,

06:33.158 --> 06:34.942
and don't call me
my personal cell phone anymore.

06:35.027 --> 06:36.994
If it isn't tapped already,
it will be soon.

06:37.062 --> 06:38.496
I got it.

06:38.563 --> 06:41.449
The authorities are gonna be
looking for you on the autobahn,

06:41.533 --> 06:45.670
so stick to Strasse 2035
going west.

06:45.737 --> 06:48.122
It'll take you
through Lohr and Blankenbach,

06:48.207 --> 06:50.541
and when you get
into the inner city,

06:50.592 --> 06:52.293
ditch the car at the Altstadt.

06:52.377 --> 06:54.457
You're gonna need a full
turnover once you get there.

06:54.463 --> 06:56.764
Clothes, phone,
wash your money.

06:56.849 --> 06:58.249
Any idea what Henry was doing

06:58.300 --> 07:00.084
for the 36 hours
he was in Frankfurt?

07:00.135 --> 07:02.687
Uh, your guess
is as good as mine.

07:02.754 --> 07:04.588
I got to tell you, Annie,

07:04.640 --> 07:07.525
going after Henry
while being a fugitive is--

07:07.592 --> 07:08.752
I know what you're gonna say.

07:08.777 --> 07:10.528
It's ill-advised,

07:10.595 --> 07:12.530
but I can't let him get away
with killing Teo.

07:12.597 --> 07:16.033
I was gonna say badass.

07:16.101 --> 07:18.402
Thanks, Auggie.

07:18.453 --> 07:20.037
All right, when I get
into the office,

07:20.105 --> 07:21.405
I'll pull some favors,

07:21.456 --> 07:25.376
requisition the current
Frankfurt CCTV feeds.

07:25.443 --> 07:26.911
Some of the best in the world.

07:26.962 --> 07:29.463
Henry's probably laying low,
but we might get lucky.

07:29.548 --> 07:31.949
You're right.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.501
We are good at this.

07:33.585 --> 07:36.254
You're damn straight.

07:36.305 --> 07:39.590
Now check in from Frankfurt,
and get rid of that phone.

07:45.297 --> 07:47.348
Good morning, Senator.

07:47.432 --> 07:50.067
My aide said it was urgent.
Well, thank you for sparing us

07:50.135 --> 07:53.938
both the Kabuki theatre
of asking why it was urgent.

07:53.989 --> 07:57.241
- Why are you here, Claire?
- The Teo Braga affair.

07:57.309 --> 07:58.910
Copenhagen.

07:58.977 --> 08:01.028
The intelligence committee
obviously has

08:01.113 --> 08:05.116
serious misgivings
about Arthur and his actions.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.451
They don't even know
the details of his actions.

08:07.502 --> 08:09.503
And you?
What did you know?

08:09.588 --> 08:11.088
How much?
When?

08:11.156 --> 08:13.591
What was your role
in this whole sordid affair?

08:13.658 --> 08:17.762
You know, you--
you authorized the transport

08:17.829 --> 08:19.680
of a captured comrade
of Teo Braga,

08:19.765 --> 08:22.433
and he was promptly killed,
so what was your agenda?

08:22.500 --> 08:24.602
Do you want me to answer
any of these questions,

08:24.669 --> 08:26.304
or are you just here
to experience

08:26.355 --> 08:28.055
the pleasure of asking them?

08:28.140 --> 08:31.508
Neither.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.277
I'm here to tell you that I've
been in contact with the DCI,

08:33.345 --> 08:35.511
and you'll be relieved
of your duties

08:35.563 --> 08:37.398
until an inquest
can be conducted.

08:37.482 --> 08:40.017
If that's
the DCI's decision,

08:40.068 --> 08:41.852
then he can tell me himself.

08:41.904 --> 08:46.290
Oh, he will, and if you think
that another file

08:46.358 --> 08:48.576
filled with photos can get you
out of this mess,

08:48.660 --> 08:50.077
well, you can forget it.

08:50.162 --> 08:51.495
You know, I've come clean
with my husband,

08:51.546 --> 08:55.666
and my marriage is in tatters,
but my morals are intact.

08:55.717 --> 08:58.419
You know, sooner or later,
everyone has to pay

08:58.503 --> 09:02.306
for their sins, and for you,

09:02.374 --> 09:07.929
Joan, that time is now.

09:12.217 --> 09:13.267
Joan?

09:13.352 --> 09:17.054
The DCI would like
to see you.

09:17.105 --> 09:18.689
I know.

09:18.740 --> 09:20.358
Okay, listen up, people.

09:20.409 --> 09:21.993
We have a very fluid situation.

09:22.060 --> 09:24.412
So here is where we are
as of 8:24 a.m.

09:24.496 --> 09:26.497
Joan Campbell has been relieved
of her duties.

09:26.564 --> 09:28.366
I'm addressing you
because I've been assigned

09:28.417 --> 09:29.951
as her interim replacement.

09:30.035 --> 09:33.371
The most pressing matter for all
of us is operative Annie Walker.

09:33.422 --> 09:36.340
She's off the grid, and European
authorities want her arrested.

09:36.408 --> 09:38.259
We have to assume
there's more to the story,

09:38.343 --> 09:40.127
but we need
to get her out first.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.712
I'm putting Calder Michaels
in charge

09:41.763 --> 09:43.080
of a rapid deployment team,

09:43.131 --> 09:44.799
which he'll meet up with
in Germany.

09:44.883 --> 09:46.133
That's all for now.

09:46.218 --> 09:49.770
Let's go, people.

09:49.855 --> 09:52.223
Get this upstairs immediately.

09:52.274 --> 09:53.641
Calder,
we need to talk.

09:53.725 --> 09:54.942
Aren't you under review?

09:55.027 --> 09:56.593
I am.
They told me to stand by.

09:56.645 --> 09:59.563
I'm standing by.

09:59.614 --> 10:03.234
Come here.

10:03.285 --> 10:05.319
What do you want?

10:05.404 --> 10:08.072
I need you to hold off
on that exfil.

10:08.123 --> 10:09.740
So you want me
to not go get Annie?

10:09.791 --> 10:11.158
Just for six hours.

10:11.243 --> 10:12.543
She needs time to get something
done on the ground.

10:12.610 --> 10:14.128
Okay.
So where is she?

10:14.212 --> 10:15.496
Obviously, if you know
she needs time,

10:15.580 --> 10:16.998
you've been talking to her.

10:17.082 --> 10:19.834
I have, but I don't want you
to get in the way of her Op.

10:19.918 --> 10:21.635
Oh, so it's an Op now.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.504
Tell me about it.
Offbook.

10:23.588 --> 10:25.172
Something only Annie can do.

10:25.257 --> 10:27.141
I got a plane to catch.

10:27.225 --> 10:30.177
Calder, give her the time.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.229
You don't get it, Auggie,
so let me spell it out to you.

10:32.297 --> 10:36.067
You're asking for trust
but offering nothing in return.

10:36.134 --> 10:38.352
You're lucky
you're just under review,

10:38.437 --> 10:39.904
'cause Joan is out
of the building--

10:39.971 --> 10:42.023
Wait, Joan's what?

10:42.107 --> 10:44.942
As far as Copenhagen goes,
you and I both know

10:44.993 --> 10:47.328
that there's no way Annie
should be running an operation.

10:47.412 --> 10:50.114
Whether you like it or not,

10:50.165 --> 10:54.118
I'm Annie's best friend
right now.

10:54.169 --> 10:57.488
Joan.
I just heard.

10:57.539 --> 11:00.925
DCI gave me 15 minutes
to clean out of my office.

11:00.992 --> 11:02.376
My codeword clearance passcodes

11:02.461 --> 11:04.211
have already been taken
off-line.

11:04.296 --> 11:06.380
- This is a witch hunt.
- Henry's master plan.

11:06.465 --> 11:08.099
The clock is ticking.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.051
It's only a matter of time
before they find my alias

11:10.135 --> 11:11.302
on Teo's account.

11:11.353 --> 11:12.887
But you are still here,
and Annie needs you,

11:12.971 --> 11:14.638
now more than ever.

11:14.689 --> 11:18.526
You know, when we sign up here,
we take an oath of fidelity,

11:18.643 --> 11:19.860
an oath of honor.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.312
We know
we're gonna give up a lot,

11:21.363 --> 11:23.364
maybe even our lives,
and we accept that,

11:23.448 --> 11:25.449
but in a pinch,
is the Agency

11:25.517 --> 11:27.401
ever really there
for us in return?

11:29.371 --> 11:30.687
Joan?
Hey.

11:30.739 --> 11:32.039
Whoa!
Joan.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.959
Joan?
Joan, are you okay?

11:35.026 --> 11:36.327
Damn it.

11:41.488 --> 11:44.225
Due to your swollen hands
and high blood pressure,

11:44.226 --> 11:46.477
you're most likely suffering
from preeclampsia.

11:46.561 --> 11:48.229
That's common
among pregnant women, right?

11:48.296 --> 11:50.231
It is, but we need to get her
to a hospital.

11:50.298 --> 11:51.338
- I'm going with you.
- No.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.761
You are staying here, Auggie.
Joan-

11:52.801 --> 11:54.902
Don't "Joan" me.
Remember what we talked about.

11:54.969 --> 11:55.903
Annie needs you.
Okay.

11:55.970 --> 11:57.905
Well, you need anything,
you call me.

11:57.972 --> 11:59.573
Okay.

11:59.641 --> 12:00.908
I'll check in.

12:00.975 --> 12:02.910
All right.

13:41.376 --> 13:43.210
Hey, man.
How's Joan?

13:43.261 --> 13:45.463
She'll be fine.
Joan's tough.

13:45.547 --> 13:46.964
Snack time's over.

13:47.048 --> 13:48.299
I need to get
a real-time scan going

13:48.383 --> 13:50.968
on the full array
of German PTZ domes.

13:51.052 --> 13:54.388
We need a 36-hour backlog
on Henry Wilcox in Frankfurt.

13:54.439 --> 13:55.756
I want facial recognition,

13:55.807 --> 13:57.308
I want passport control,

13:57.392 --> 13:59.527
and I want
any monetary forensics.

13:59.594 --> 14:01.395
Um...

14:01.446 --> 14:03.981
What?
I don't hear any typing.

14:04.065 --> 14:06.066
It's just some of the projects
you had us do recently

14:06.118 --> 14:07.651
have been a little risky.

14:07.736 --> 14:11.605
And by that he means
super risky, job-wise.

14:11.656 --> 14:13.991
Yeah, you're right,

14:14.075 --> 14:17.461
but I can't trust anyone else
with this.

14:17.546 --> 14:22.249
It's for Annie.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.585
You hear me typing now, right?

14:40.018 --> 14:42.970
Hello, Arthur.

14:43.021 --> 14:44.905
How the hell
did you get in here?

14:44.973 --> 14:46.974
You really should be asking
yourself that question.

14:47.025 --> 14:48.526
Leave now, Henry,
before I hurt you.

14:48.610 --> 14:51.662
Doesn't feel good being held
against your will, does it?

14:51.746 --> 14:54.448
You've always been imperious,

14:54.499 --> 14:56.367
considered yourself
above the law,

14:56.451 --> 15:00.037
as if the rules
didn't apply to you.

15:00.121 --> 15:02.656
You were that way
when you took Jai away from me,

15:02.707 --> 15:04.792
and you're still that way.

15:04.843 --> 15:10.264
But now there's nothing more
you can take away from me.

15:11.666 --> 15:14.185
I hope you realize that
before you die trying.

15:17.522 --> 15:22.476
I'm done talking with you,
Henry.

15:22.527 --> 15:26.680
Your actions
have already spoken, loudly.

15:36.458 --> 15:40.995
Good-bye, Arthur.

15:48.303 --> 15:50.337
Nothing.

15:50.388 --> 15:52.089
- What do we got?
- Frankfurt is wired.

15:52.173 --> 15:55.309
CCTV cameras on almost every
block, and all of them work,

15:55.376 --> 15:56.560
but
but Henry's smart.

15:56.645 --> 15:57.845
He knows where they're placed.

15:57.896 --> 15:59.647
- What is that?
- It's a full 180 radial

15:59.714 --> 16:02.266
of a street
called Sieberstrasse.

16:02.350 --> 16:03.851
- Well, what do you see?
- Jackpot!

16:03.902 --> 16:05.622
Henry Wilcox,
leaving the restaurant Sevres,

16:05.654 --> 16:07.571
uh, two days ago,
8:30 p.m.

16:28.760 --> 16:33.347
Hello.

16:56.788 --> 16:58.822
Mingus, you there?

16:58.907 --> 17:02.626
Yeah. We have
a mutual friend in common.

17:02.711 --> 17:04.795
He was in your neck of the woods
two days ago.

17:04.878 --> 17:06.163
Really?
Lmfao.

17:06.247 --> 17:07.381
Small world.

17:07.448 --> 17:10.800
What was he doing?
Grabbing a bite.

17:10.885 --> 17:12.836
Sevres was the name of the spot.

17:12.921 --> 17:14.972
Maybe I'll check it out too.

17:15.056 --> 17:19.310
Do they have a happy hour?

17:19.394 --> 17:23.012
Not sure.
Joan had to step out for a bit.

17:23.098 --> 17:26.983
Read between the lines.

17:27.068 --> 17:28.435
Got it.

17:28.486 --> 17:32.156
This has been
an awesome conversation.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.024
Let's do it again soon.

17:34.109 --> 17:36.744
I'd love that.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.294
Sorry brother. No marching
band welcome.

18:23.297 --> 18:26.049
This isn't exactly a marching
band situation, Gary.

18:26.133 --> 18:27.801
It's okay.
It's more personal.

18:27.868 --> 18:30.670
- You know the operative?
- Yeah, she's in my division.

18:30.721 --> 18:32.922
I need her back quickly.

18:33.007 --> 18:35.675
And you said you wouldn't go
soft when you went back to HQ.

18:35.726 --> 18:37.210
This isn't me being soft.

18:37.261 --> 18:40.730
This is me trying to get to
the truth, and I can't get that

18:40.815 --> 18:43.733
until I get Annie Walker
back on American soil.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.735
- Okay.
- I personally requested you

18:45.820 --> 18:48.300
to lead this exfil, not because
of our longstanding friendship,

18:48.322 --> 18:51.024
but because I believe you were
the guy who could get it done.

18:51.075 --> 18:53.193
Can you get the job
done for me, Gary?

18:53.244 --> 18:54.527
I think you know the answer
to that question.

18:54.578 --> 18:56.579
- All right.
- I've placed six two-man SUVs

18:56.664 --> 18:59.115
at multiple extraction points
down four main auto-routes.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.000
Walker's gonna recognize
a protocol pattern.

19:01.068 --> 19:03.086
Once we make contact,
we fall into escort

19:03.170 --> 19:04.671
all the way
back to Ramstein.

19:04.738 --> 19:07.373
Have your girl on the same
damn plane you flew in on.

19:07.424 --> 19:09.425
No.

19:09.510 --> 19:13.296
We're going into Frankfurt,
center city.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.348
We'll fan out on foot
from there.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.550
My "girl," as you call her,
seems to be staying in town.

19:17.601 --> 19:21.271
I want to find out why.

19:44.278 --> 19:46.880
Ah, I-I-I don't speak German.

19:46.947 --> 19:49.048
We are closed.
We open for dinner at 6:30,

19:49.116 --> 19:50.333
but you need a reservation.

19:50.417 --> 19:51.467
We're fully committed
this evening.

19:51.552 --> 19:52.635
I actually wanted
to speak to you

19:52.720 --> 19:53.836
about something else.

19:53.921 --> 19:55.805
Um, this--this is a picture
of my father.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.807
I think he ate here
a few nights ago.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.425
It's not our policy
to discuss patrons.

19:59.476 --> 20:03.930
No, um--
I don't know how to say this.

20:03.981 --> 20:06.649
I think he's having an affair,
and he told my mother

20:06.734 --> 20:08.434
that he was having
a business dinner here.

20:08.485 --> 20:11.521
I wonder if you remember
anything about who he ate with,

20:11.605 --> 20:15.108
just to put my mind at ease?

20:20.114 --> 20:21.948
Hmm, you're right.

20:21.999 --> 20:24.417
He was here a few nights ago.

20:24.484 --> 20:26.202
He met with a woman.
I'm sorry.

20:26.287 --> 20:27.837
It seemed romantic.

20:27.922 --> 20:31.124
He ordered a bottle
of, uh, Weingut Keller Riesling,

20:31.175 --> 20:32.508
and he brought
his own flowers.

20:32.593 --> 20:35.378
Okay.
Thank you.

20:35.462 --> 20:37.997
Uh, if it's any consolation,
the woman didn't stay long.

20:38.048 --> 20:39.882
She talked very briefly
with him,

20:39.967 --> 20:43.136
but things didn't...
seem good,

20:43.187 --> 20:44.771
and she left
without ever sitting down.

20:44.838 --> 20:47.390
Hmm, maybe the affair's over.
Maybe.

20:54.365 --> 20:58.534
He was there two nights ago
with a woman.

20:58.619 --> 21:00.370
Flowers and wine.

21:00.454 --> 21:01.537
What do you think that's about?

21:01.622 --> 21:03.740
Probably a set protocol

21:03.824 --> 21:05.158
with a security consultant
or a cutout.

21:05.209 --> 21:07.243
It takes more than one person,

21:07.328 --> 21:10.830
even if it is Henry Wilcox,
to pull off an attack like that.

21:10.881 --> 21:13.049
The flowers could have meant
Copenhagen was a go.

21:13.133 --> 21:15.718
Speaking of which, any word
on our red-haired friend?

21:15.803 --> 21:16.886
Nothing yet.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.972
Scanned the HSTL and GAD,

21:19.039 --> 21:20.757
spoke with other spy services.

21:20.841 --> 21:22.508
There's guys that fit
that description,

21:22.559 --> 21:23.759
but they're all accounted for.

21:23.811 --> 21:26.396
None have flagged
in Western Europe.

21:28.816 --> 21:32.068
TAC team Omega leader.

21:32.152 --> 21:33.569
Auggie, I've been made.

21:33.654 --> 21:35.071
I've located the target.

21:35.155 --> 21:36.906
I got to go.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.858
August-Sieberstrasse
and Grunebergweg.

21:38.909 --> 21:41.060
Copy.

21:44.331 --> 21:47.667
Target not receptive
to approach.

23:16.290 --> 23:17.990
TAC team Omega leader.

23:18.041 --> 23:20.993
Target lost.

23:28.469 --> 23:30.269
- Deric?
- Hey, Gary.

23:30.337 --> 23:32.722
I didn't know Agency
Special Ops was in on this.

23:32.806 --> 23:38.478
Need to know.

23:43.183 --> 23:46.319
Gary, report.

23:46.370 --> 23:49.205
Gary, report!

23:51.625 --> 23:54.994
Gary!

24:14.231 --> 24:17.316
Status report.

24:17.384 --> 24:20.486
We have
a rapidly escalating situation.

24:20.554 --> 24:23.239
Gary Probert,
our exfil team point-man,

24:23.323 --> 24:27.076
has been found shot dead
in Frankfurt central.

24:27.161 --> 24:30.246
He'd been in pursuit
of operative Walker.

24:30.330 --> 24:32.698
We've changed operative Walker's
classification.

24:32.749 --> 24:35.868
She's now to be treated
as a rogue operative.

24:35.919 --> 24:38.004
Our exfil team
has been instructed

24:38.071 --> 24:40.873
to assume a tactical approach.

24:40.924 --> 24:45.678
For now that's all.

24:45.745 --> 24:47.597
Annie a rogue operative?
Are you kidding?

24:47.681 --> 24:49.682
I suggest you check
that tone, Anderson.

24:49.749 --> 24:52.268
You are jumping to conclusions
and abandoning one of our own

24:52.352 --> 24:53.636
just when she needs us most.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.054
We don't even know
Annie's side of the story.

24:55.105 --> 24:56.466
That's because she's
not telling us

24:56.473 --> 24:57.640
her side of the story.

24:57.724 --> 25:00.860
Miss Walker's behavior
has been baffling.

25:00.927 --> 25:03.896
She's breaking rules
and running from our help

25:03.947 --> 25:07.617
and apparently gunning down
one of her fellow operatives,

25:07.701 --> 25:09.619
and the only question is why?

25:09.703 --> 25:11.237
What the hell
is he doing here?

25:11.288 --> 25:13.239
Senator Pierson
talked to the DCI.

25:13.290 --> 25:15.124
She felt
Henry's intimate knowledge

25:15.209 --> 25:17.076
of the events in Copenhagen
would be an advantage,

25:17.127 --> 25:18.607
so we brought him on
as a green badge.

25:18.629 --> 25:20.046
Lexington Global Consulting.

25:20.113 --> 25:22.882
- I want him gone.
- This isn't your DPD, Auggie.

25:22.949 --> 25:24.083
This is insane.

25:24.134 --> 25:25.968
Henry is the reason
that we're in this.

25:26.053 --> 25:27.174
- How so?
- If you're talking

25:27.254 --> 25:30.056
about my knowledge
of Arthur Campbell

25:30.123 --> 25:32.425
and his terrorist son
Teo Braga

25:32.476 --> 25:36.762
before the events in Copenhagen,
then, yes,

25:36.813 --> 25:40.566
I did have a file
which said as much,

25:40.634 --> 25:42.235
which I handed to Annie.

25:42.302 --> 25:43.769
You played her.

25:43.820 --> 25:45.655
No.
No.

25:45.739 --> 25:47.323
She was the one playing me.

25:47.407 --> 25:49.242
I listened to her counsel,

25:49.309 --> 25:52.194
and I offered her
a job in my firm.

25:52.279 --> 25:54.497
Well, I never
in my wildest dreams

25:54.581 --> 25:57.166
would have thought her capable
of treason.

25:57.251 --> 25:59.252
I mistook her
for a patriot.

25:59.319 --> 26:01.003
Auggie!
Security!

26:01.088 --> 26:03.005
How's it feel?

26:03.090 --> 26:05.258
Let him go, or the SPOs
will shoot you down right now.

26:05.325 --> 26:07.593
You're done.

26:07.661 --> 26:09.128
Get him out of here.
Go!

26:09.179 --> 26:11.464
Get him out!

26:14.167 --> 26:15.885
Are you okay?
Yeah. Mmhmm.

26:15.969 --> 26:17.603
I'm fine.

26:17.671 --> 26:19.855
I'm fine.
He's just--

26:19.940 --> 26:22.141
he's just a kid.
He has to cool down.

26:51.334 --> 26:52.533
Listen up.

26:52.585 --> 26:54.011
Frankfurt <i>polizei</i>
just got eyes on her.

26:54.012 --> 26:54.946
They're directing all cars.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.230
We are getting
to Walker first.

26:56.315 --> 26:59.650
Let's go. Let's go.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.072
Go!

27:23.259 --> 27:25.894
She's two blocks away.
Let's push it.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.817
Go, go, go, go!

27:42.745 --> 27:43.778
Stop!

27:43.829 --> 27:45.947
Go! Go right here.
Go right here!

27:52.004 --> 27:55.707
Go, go!

27:56.792 --> 27:58.293
Hey!

27:58.344 --> 27:59.461
Hey! Easy, easy!

28:10.139 --> 28:12.107
Joan, how you feeling?

28:12.174 --> 28:14.976
- I'm about as good as I look.
- Well, you look fantastic.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.278
Listen, I don't want to cause

28:17.346 --> 28:21.483
you any more undue stress, but
Henry's back in the building,

28:21.534 --> 28:24.703
and on a more personal note,
they booted me out too.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.205
I kind of went ballistic
on Henry.

28:27.289 --> 28:28.523
Did you?

28:28.574 --> 28:30.825
Good for you.
Yeah, we'll see.

28:30.876 --> 28:34.695
In what capacity could Henry
possibly be in the CIA?

28:34.747 --> 28:37.031
Officially?
Consulting on Annie's situation,

28:37.083 --> 28:39.250
per the recommendation
of Senator Pierson.

28:39.335 --> 28:42.554
Unofficially, making
Annie's life miserable.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.723
Okay, we got to work
this problem together.

28:44.807 --> 28:47.008
Does she have anything

28:47.059 --> 28:49.344
on the 36 hours
Henry was in Frankfurt?

28:49.395 --> 28:52.063
Henry visited a fancy
restaurant and met briefly

28:52.148 --> 28:53.898
with a middle-aged woman.

28:53.983 --> 28:57.018
- Mm-hmm?
- These are security captures

28:57.069 --> 28:58.486
of all the women
who came in and out

28:58.554 --> 28:59.904
of that restaurant
that night.

28:59.989 --> 29:02.524
Right.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.442
Well, this is her.
You sure?

29:04.527 --> 29:06.411
That was fast.
I am sure

29:06.495 --> 29:10.331
because that is
Jai's mom Sana.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.201
What's she doing
in Frankfurt?

29:13.252 --> 29:14.902
She works for a company
that does a lot of business

29:14.954 --> 29:16.254
on the European exchange.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.873
So what is Henry doing
meeting with his ex-wife

29:18.924 --> 29:21.626
the night before a terrorist
attack he perpetrated?

29:21.710 --> 29:22.627
Do you think
she was involved?

29:22.711 --> 29:25.213
Maybe.
Maybe not.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.433
Auggie, you need to get
one of your NSA buddies to tag

29:28.517 --> 29:32.270
phone locator records for,
so we can get a call history.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.272
Okay.
I'll do it, but, Joan?

29:34.356 --> 29:36.157
The doctor said--
I know what the doctor said.

29:36.192 --> 29:38.259
The doctor said,
"don't go into my office,"

29:38.310 --> 29:40.595
not turn off my brain,

29:40.646 --> 29:42.614
and Annie needs us, right?
She does.

29:42.698 --> 29:46.734
Okay, so why
are you still here?

29:46.786 --> 29:48.620
Auggie, report in.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.706
We might both be fired,
but you still work for me.

29:51.773 --> 29:53.408
Yes, ma'am.

29:55.911 --> 29:58.046
Hey.

29:58.113 --> 29:59.130
Hey, it's me.

29:59.215 --> 30:01.049
Well, you're getting crafty.

30:01.116 --> 30:03.218
Your phone
has a Hamburg axis-router.

30:03.285 --> 30:04.302
Yeah. I pinched it
off an eight year-old

30:04.386 --> 30:06.171
getting off a tourist bus.

30:06.255 --> 30:07.922
She was too young to have
a cell phone anyway.

30:07.973 --> 30:11.476
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time.

30:11.560 --> 30:14.929
In a nutshell,
Henry has Braithwaite's ear

30:14.980 --> 30:17.982
inside Langley,
and I'm out of the building.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.902
- That's a big nutshell.
- It gets bigger.

30:20.969 --> 30:24.022
The woman Henry was meeting with
was his ex-wife Sana.

30:24.106 --> 30:25.690
Travel records verify it.

30:25.774 --> 30:27.141
Her company has a seat
on the exchange

30:27.193 --> 30:28.660
in the Commerzbank building.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.162
I thought they divorced
years ago.

30:31.247 --> 30:33.248
Yeah, well, maybe once
you really love someone,

30:33.315 --> 30:35.667
those bonds
never go away.

30:38.120 --> 30:41.873
You think that's true?

30:45.261 --> 30:46.711
What do you mean,
we don't have much time?

30:46.795 --> 30:50.715
Annie, there's a CIA operative
down in Frankfurt.

30:50.799 --> 30:53.384
He came with a team led
by Calder, who's on the ground.

30:53.469 --> 30:55.303
Down?
Who do they thi--

30:55.354 --> 30:58.356
they think I killed him?

30:58.440 --> 31:00.892
Yeah, but if you
can find Calder,

31:00.976 --> 31:02.477
maybe he can still
get you out.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.396
Uh, no.

31:05.481 --> 31:08.349
I'm gonna find Jai's mom,
and I'm gonna turn her

31:08.400 --> 31:10.652
and use her as leverage
against Henry.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.120
Annie, think this through.

31:12.187 --> 31:14.706
Henry came after all of us
because we didn't protect Jai.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.824
If you go near his ex-wife,
he'll kill you.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.996
Yeah, well, maybe it's time
to give him what he wants.

31:19.027 --> 31:20.545
What do you mean?

31:20.629 --> 31:23.131
I'm gonna take myself
off the game board.

31:25.033 --> 31:28.219
Annie, please don't do this.

31:28.304 --> 31:31.222
You'd be working without
CIA protection, without me.

31:31.307 --> 31:32.507
Henry has taken enough.

31:32.558 --> 31:36.728
He took Arthur, Teo, and us.

31:36.812 --> 31:39.230
It's time to strike back,
and it's time to end this.

31:39.315 --> 31:43.518
Even if this works, you may
not be able to come back, ever.

31:43.569 --> 31:48.773
I know, and there are things I
feel I still want to say to you.

31:48.857 --> 31:50.325
Then come home
and say them.

31:50.392 --> 31:52.610
There's always another way.

31:52.695 --> 31:56.164
Find Calder.

32:05.207 --> 32:07.342
- Calder Michaels.
- We need to talk.

32:07.409 --> 32:10.295
If I give you a location,
will you come alone?

32:10.379 --> 32:12.547
Yes.

32:40.302 --> 32:42.160
Walker?

32:47.344 --> 32:50.012
I need your help.

32:50.063 --> 32:52.214
You repeatedly withheld
information from me,

32:52.265 --> 32:54.066
consorted
with a known terrorist,

32:54.151 --> 32:55.684
and killed one of my men.

32:55.735 --> 32:59.522
I didn't kill anybody.

32:59.573 --> 33:01.740
All right.
Make it quick.

33:01.825 --> 33:03.075
My guys don't hear from me
in five minutes,

33:03.160 --> 33:04.527
they'll be all over your ass.

33:04.578 --> 33:06.245
You know that something
isn't right at Langley,

33:06.329 --> 33:08.581
and Henry Wilcox has something
to do with it.

33:08.665 --> 33:11.834
If you take me in, it will be
the end of my career,

33:11.901 --> 33:13.919
and we will never find out
the truth.

33:14.004 --> 33:16.088
When we first met,
you said we could be

33:16.173 --> 33:18.958
friends, enemies,
or just remain spies

33:19.042 --> 33:20.426
for the same great country.

33:20.510 --> 33:22.044
- That's right.
- I am asking you to make

33:22.095 --> 33:27.016
that decision,
right here, now.

33:27.083 --> 33:31.587
The only way you're leaving
Frankfurt is with me

33:31.638 --> 33:33.022
or in a body bag.

33:33.089 --> 33:35.524
That's what I'm counting on.

33:39.596 --> 33:41.313
Nothing.

33:41.398 --> 33:43.365
She got away.

33:43.433 --> 33:44.867
She dropped this, though.

33:44.934 --> 33:47.036
Security key for Commerzbank.

33:47.103 --> 33:49.655
It's down there.
We got this.

33:49.739 --> 33:51.657
That Commerzbank tower
is the seat

33:51.741 --> 33:53.826
of the European futures
exchange.

33:53.910 --> 33:56.829
Walker may be planning
an even more serious attack.

33:56.913 --> 33:58.247
Agreed.

33:58.298 --> 34:00.466
Calder, take up strategic
position around the building.

34:00.550 --> 34:02.334
Use deadly force
if necessary.

34:02.419 --> 34:03.969
Understood.

34:04.054 --> 34:08.056
Okay, so they told us to do
what we were gonna do anyway.

34:08.123 --> 34:09.757
Let's move out.

34:24.658 --> 34:26.492
"Dear Danielle,

34:26.576 --> 34:30.446
"I know we haven't had a chance
to talk in a while.

34:30.496 --> 34:33.081
"We may not get a chance
to speak again,

34:33.149 --> 34:35.451
"so I'm asking you to think
about the times

34:35.502 --> 34:39.455
"when dad had us look
for the evening star, Venus,

34:39.505 --> 34:45.127
"when it appeared in the west
just after sunset.

34:45.178 --> 34:48.130
"No matter where we lived all
over the world, there was Venus.

34:48.181 --> 34:52.351
"It was our star.

34:52.435 --> 34:55.853
"Now I'm asking you
to think of me

34:55.938 --> 34:57.940
"whenever you see Venus
in the sky.

34:58.007 --> 35:01.060
"No matter where you are,

35:01.144 --> 35:03.229
"I'll be there.

35:03.313 --> 35:06.649
I love you, Danielle."

35:23.633 --> 35:24.917
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:25.001 --> 35:27.720
Okay, we have a visual
at the Commerzbank tower.

35:27.804 --> 35:29.922
Eurex mainframe
is on the 32nd floor.

35:30.006 --> 35:32.007
That's got to be her target.

35:32.058 --> 35:34.893
She could do the most damage
if she takes that out.

35:34.978 --> 35:36.979
Alert your team.

35:37.046 --> 35:38.264
TAC team Omega leader.

35:38.348 --> 35:39.398
Target has entered the building.

35:39.482 --> 35:41.900
32nd floor presumed target.

35:41.985 --> 35:44.520
Team leader
positioned on 32nd floor.

35:44.571 --> 35:45.938
I have tactical advantage

35:46.022 --> 35:47.823
and men on bracketing floors

35:47.890 --> 35:50.192
in case the target
throws a curve.

36:05.041 --> 36:08.127
She's in the middle elevator
on the western bank.

36:08.211 --> 36:11.180
Roger.
Going radio silent.

36:12.716 --> 36:16.268
Come on, come on.

36:22.425 --> 36:24.092
No, Annie.

36:24.144 --> 36:25.527
- International caller--
- Not this phone.

36:25.595 --> 36:27.563
She's called Auggie Anderson's
personal cell.

36:27.614 --> 36:30.899
Give us audio
from the tap on Anderson.

36:30.950 --> 36:34.286
Annie,
you don't have to do this.

36:34.371 --> 36:36.288
I'm sorry, Auggie.

36:36.373 --> 36:39.041
This is Henry Wilcox's fault,
not yours.

36:39.108 --> 36:40.659
He knows we're onto her.

36:40.744 --> 36:42.911
I should never have read you
in that morning in bed.

36:42.962 --> 36:45.664
I should have just said
I love you.

36:45.749 --> 36:47.499
I love you too.
Come home.

36:47.584 --> 36:49.284
- I can't.
- Annie.

36:49.336 --> 36:51.503
It's too late
for heart-to-hearts.

36:51.588 --> 36:56.342
- No, Annie--
- Good-bye, Auggie.

36:56.426 --> 36:58.460
Annie!

36:59.979 --> 37:01.797
Annie!

37:18.581 --> 37:21.083
Annie!

37:57.620 --> 38:00.122
Operative Walker is dead.

38:00.189 --> 38:04.460
I repeat,
Annie Walker is dead.

38:06.195 --> 38:10.632
It had to be done.

39:42.190 --> 39:44.391
You look terrible.

39:44.475 --> 39:46.476
I feel terrible.

39:46.527 --> 39:51.398
Here.
Drink this.

39:58.489 --> 40:00.207
We're here alone.

40:00.291 --> 40:02.292
It worked?

40:02.359 --> 40:05.962
After all the times we've had,
how could you have any doubt?

40:06.030 --> 40:08.749
I never had any doubt.

40:08.833 --> 40:10.917
I trust you with my life.

40:11.002 --> 40:12.636
Clearly.

40:15.039 --> 40:16.306
It worked.

40:16.373 --> 40:18.592
So you got a change
of clothes, money, a temp I.D.

40:18.676 --> 40:20.677
until you cement the new one,
and a Pesek Zman.

40:20.728 --> 40:22.512
A what?

40:22.563 --> 40:24.765
It's Israeli chocolate.

40:24.849 --> 40:27.150
Oh.

40:27.218 --> 40:30.904
And this is the Mossad file
for Sana Wilcox.

40:30.988 --> 40:33.323
Mossad?
I thought you quit the Mossad.

40:33.390 --> 40:37.444
Why would you ever think that,
neshama?

40:37.528 --> 40:39.162
I bet you never even got
on a boat, did you?

40:39.230 --> 40:40.614
Didn't even get
out of Europe.

40:40.698 --> 40:42.499
Mossad's not very big
on vacations.

40:42.566 --> 40:46.169
So is this really the end
of Annie Walker?

40:48.756 --> 40:51.174
Yes.

40:51.242 --> 40:54.845
Then it gives me great
pleasure to be the last one

40:54.912 --> 40:56.513
to ever tell you this.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.132
You're an amazing woman,
Annie.

41:02.770 --> 41:05.272
I can't thank you enough.

41:05.356 --> 41:08.942
Thank me next time.
Whoever you'll be.

41:19.203 --> 41:21.121
Go.

41:25.409 --> 41:29.496
Good-bye, Annie.
