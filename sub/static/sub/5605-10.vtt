WEBVTT

00:03.771 --> 00:06.772
Okay, everything is all set
for my ski trip with Kyle.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.006
Yeah, honey, listen,

00:08.008 --> 00:09.474
it's gonna be
a pretty warm weekend.

00:09.476 --> 00:10.808
You're gonna be
skiing in slush.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.677
I think it'll be fine.
Don't worry about it.

00:13.679 --> 00:15.945
I hate to see you stuck
in a room all weekend.

00:15.947 --> 00:17.346
Um, you know what?

00:17.348 --> 00:19.715
I'm pretty sure Kyle
is bringing a deck of cards.

00:19.717 --> 00:21.116
You know,
I'll call Arapahoe.

00:21.118 --> 00:22.851
They probably have snow
at altitude --

00:22.853 --> 00:25.353
Mom, it's not
that kind of a ski trip.

00:25.355 --> 00:27.288
Oh. You know,
if you really loved me,

00:27.290 --> 00:28.522
you'd lie to me.

00:28.524 --> 00:29.856
I just tried.

00:29.858 --> 00:32.425
Bye! Love you.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.192
Hey, Eve!
(groans)

00:34.194 --> 00:36.227
How was school?
Awful.

00:36.229 --> 00:38.495
Why can't my chemistry teacher
go cook meth

00:38.497 --> 00:40.163
and die in
a hail of bullets?

00:40.165 --> 00:44.533
Eve, you know I'm only
up to season four!

00:44.535 --> 00:46.835
Sorry. I just --
I just hate chemistry.

00:46.837 --> 00:48.736
It has nothing to do
with life.

00:48.738 --> 00:52.172
Uh, except that
it is the basis of<i> all</i> life.

00:52.174 --> 00:54.908
Uh, but as you kids say,
whatevs.

00:54.910 --> 00:57.644
Okay, I know I'm gonna
regret saying this,

00:57.646 --> 01:00.346
but is there any possible way
you could --

01:00.348 --> 01:03.248
Tutor you in chemistry?
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.016
Okay.
That regret came quick.

01:05.018 --> 01:07.518
Everybody always goes to
your father for help,

01:07.520 --> 01:09.987
but not this time,
and you want to know why?

01:09.989 --> 01:12.689
Because science
is<i> my</i> domain.

01:12.691 --> 01:13.923
Yeah...

01:13.925 --> 01:15.491
That, and when I went
to go ask Dad,

01:15.493 --> 01:16.859
he said, "Talk to mom."

01:16.861 --> 01:20.229
He knows that science
is<i> my</i> domain.

01:20.231 --> 01:22.331
(laughs)
Hey, guys.

01:22.333 --> 01:25.067
Hey! Hey, how was hockey
practice, my little goon?

01:25.069 --> 01:28.403
Really, really,
<i> really</i> bad.

01:28.405 --> 01:30.438
Oh, yeah,
I've had practices like that,

01:30.440 --> 01:32.506
where I'm struggling,
and I get to see

01:32.508 --> 01:34.541
how hard sports are
for everyone else.

01:34.543 --> 01:35.842
It passes.

01:36.911 --> 01:39.711
Hey, honey, why is --
why is Boyd so upset?

01:39.713 --> 01:42.413
Probably the looming
debt crisis.

01:42.415 --> 01:44.448
Or the fact
that his coach was arrested

01:44.450 --> 01:46.883
in front of all the players today.
(gasps)

01:46.885 --> 01:48.184
Coach Boggs?
Mm-hmm.

01:48.186 --> 01:50.619
He was arrested?

01:50.621 --> 01:53.588
Oh, y-yeah.
Yeah, I could see that.

01:53.590 --> 01:56.591
Apparently,
he refused to pay his taxes.

01:56.593 --> 01:58.859
Mm. Well, we all talk
about doing that,

01:58.861 --> 02:01.862
but that son of a gun
actually did it.

02:01.864 --> 02:03.296
Well,
that's probably why

02:03.298 --> 02:05.298
he had the money to
sponsor the team.  Yeah.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.266
How dare that maniac
use his money

02:07.268 --> 02:09.568
to enrich the lives
of little Denver kids

02:09.570 --> 02:11.636
when he could be
sending his money

02:11.638 --> 02:13.437
to be wasted
in Washington.

02:13.439 --> 02:15.272
Problem is,
we have no coach now.

02:15.274 --> 02:16.973
Why don't you get one of
the other parents to coach?

02:16.975 --> 02:18.607
What other parent's
gonna coach?

02:18.609 --> 02:20.408
Well, what about Ryan?
He could coach.

02:20.410 --> 02:22.943
Oh, there's a good idea.
Yeah.

02:22.945 --> 02:26.212
And we could get the Dalai Lama
to lead SEAL Team Six.

02:27.081 --> 02:28.747
Wait a minute. Wait, wasn't
he -- wasn't he, like,

02:28.749 --> 02:30.281
an all-star hockey player
in high school?

02:30.283 --> 02:31.782
Yeah, but he's like
soft serve.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.817
He just oozes out of the nozzle.
Hey, look.

02:33.819 --> 02:35.485
You want Boyd
to play on a team?

02:35.487 --> 02:37.453
Unless you can think of
somebody better,

02:37.455 --> 02:38.987
I think Ryan's
your best bet.

02:38.989 --> 02:42.123
(groans) I have to ask Ryan
to coach a team.

02:42.125 --> 02:45.959
I'm afraid I'll end up
in his feelings journal.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.901
Oh, no jokes here.
I love Canada.

02:57.903 --> 02:59.836
We'll never build a wall

02:59.838 --> 03:01.170
Sorry to hear about

03:01.172 --> 03:02.738
Boyd's coach
getting busted for tax evasion?

03:02.740 --> 03:04.573
Yeah, we're actually
gonna hold a car wash

03:04.575 --> 03:08.642
to try and raise $635,000.

03:08.644 --> 03:10.510
Otherwise, no coach.

03:10.512 --> 03:11.811
Which is the reason why
I asked you down here.

03:11.813 --> 03:13.112
I want you to look around,

03:13.114 --> 03:15.080
and pick out
somebody in this room

03:15.082 --> 03:17.415
that you think could coach
Boyd's hockey team.

03:17.417 --> 03:20.517
And it can't be Chuck, me,
or any of my employees.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.119
Oh, no. No.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.955
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.857
No, while it is true
I am pretty great on the blades,

03:29.859 --> 03:33.660
I would rather use
these smooth moves...

03:36.531 --> 03:38.831
...to teach Boyd something
a little less competitive,

03:38.833 --> 03:40.432
like figure skating.

03:40.434 --> 03:44.368
Yeah, something gentle,
like Tonya Harding did.

03:44.370 --> 03:46.536
Kneecapping.

03:47.472 --> 03:48.938
Not cool.

03:49.874 --> 03:51.607
Look, as much as
I'd like my grandson

03:51.609 --> 03:53.709
to star in the Ice Capades,
he likes ice hockey.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.610
My dad coached me, okay?

03:55.612 --> 03:57.445
Fathers coaching sons --

03:57.447 --> 03:58.979
(deep voice) Not cool.

03:58.981 --> 04:01.648
Is that your imitation
of Chuck?

04:01.650 --> 04:02.949
Not good.

04:04.152 --> 04:05.384
What's the real problem
here?

04:05.386 --> 04:06.985
It just gets weird,
okay?

04:06.987 --> 04:09.721
The -- the kids think that
the father's favoring the son

04:09.723 --> 04:12.290
and that's why I never felt
like one of the guys.

04:12.292 --> 04:14.392
So now's your chance
to become one.

04:14.394 --> 04:15.893
Coach the team.
Why me?

04:15.895 --> 04:18.729
I mean, you can get anyone
to coach little kids, okay?

04:18.731 --> 04:21.198
It doesn't take a genius
to run a power play

04:21.200 --> 04:23.366
or call a line change

04:23.368 --> 04:25.735
or devise a neutral zone trap

04:25.737 --> 04:28.537
that David Blaine
couldn't escape.

04:28.539 --> 04:31.006
See, it doesn't take
a genius.

04:31.008 --> 04:32.573

04:34.910 --> 04:37.010
You know what, Mike?
I'll do it.

04:37.012 --> 04:38.344
Great. One condition --

04:38.346 --> 04:39.812
I want you to be tough
on those kids.

04:39.814 --> 04:43.182
You keep that tofu
in the dairy case.

04:43.184 --> 04:44.850
Hockey's a red-meat sport.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.351
(laughs) Oh, Michael.

04:46.353 --> 04:49.687
You would never put tofu

I'll coach the way I coach.

just the opposite of that.

Ah, pink.
Damn it, it's another girl!

This kept happening
to Scott and I

when we were doing
the experiment in class.

05:44.429 --> 05:46.562
Oh, who's Scott?
My lab partner.

05:46.564 --> 05:48.363
He's a great
lacrosse player,

05:48.365 --> 05:50.264
but when it comes
to chemistry...

05:50.266 --> 05:52.766
he's a great
lacrosse player.

05:52.768 --> 05:54.701
Well, you can't blame it
on him.

05:54.703 --> 05:56.135
He's not here.

05:56.137 --> 05:58.103
He's not the one
who titrated that thiosulfate.

Mother, I will burn you
with this acid.

Good luck. That's a base,

06:12.283 --> 06:13.749
Look...

06:13.751 --> 06:15.584
It's the scientific method.
It's trial and error.

Coaching is so important
for kids.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.573
We used to have
this wonderful coach.

08:57.575 --> 08:59.908
He made run the stairs
till we threw up,

08:59.910 --> 09:01.276
then made us mop it up,

09:01.278 --> 09:03.444
then run the stairs
with the buckets.

09:03.446 --> 09:05.912
Father O'Connell
is a terrific guy.

09:08.883 --> 09:10.716
Sounds like Ryan
has the Predators

09:10.718 --> 09:12.017
doing what Predators do --

09:12.019 --> 09:13.752
killing.
That's right.

09:13.754 --> 09:17.021
With Outdoor Man emblazoned
on the chest of the victors

09:17.023 --> 09:20.190
as they stand over their
vanquished third-grade foes.

09:20.192 --> 09:23.126
I've always wanted Ryan
to show some toughness,

09:23.128 --> 09:25.128
or anything
an anthropologist

09:25.130 --> 09:27.296
would identify
as male behavior.

09:27.298 --> 09:29.631
Man,
I loved playing hockey.

09:29.633 --> 09:31.899
A black man from Minnesota
plays hockey.

09:31.901 --> 09:33.500
You're a walking stereotype.

09:34.236 --> 09:35.568
Hey, guys.
Hey, Ryan.

09:35.570 --> 09:37.536
I heard the team
is doing great, man.

09:37.538 --> 09:38.904
Congratulations.
Thanks.

09:38.906 --> 09:41.406
Yeah, they sure are.
I got a great idea.

09:41.408 --> 09:43.107
I say we print up
some t-shirts

09:43.109 --> 09:45.476
with one of those
hard-ass hockey catchphrases

09:45.478 --> 09:46.743
you bark at the kids.

09:46.745 --> 09:48.311
Hit me with one.

09:48.313 --> 09:50.146
I quit.

09:50.148 --> 09:51.847
Hit me with another one.

09:53.317 --> 09:55.383
No, I'm -- I'm serious, Mike.
I'm quitting.

09:55.385 --> 09:57.084
Look, Kristin and I
talked about it,

09:57.086 --> 09:59.286
and I-I just really don't like
who I've become.

09:59.288 --> 10:02.155
A winner?
You'll get used to that.

10:02.157 --> 10:03.890
No, my father.

10:03.892 --> 10:06.325
That's the real reason
I didn't want to get into this.

10:06.327 --> 10:08.427
As a coach,
all he did was yell.

10:08.429 --> 10:09.661
That's what coaches do,

10:09.663 --> 10:11.396
is yell until their voices
give out.

10:11.398 --> 10:13.097
That's why
they gave them whistles.

10:13.099 --> 10:15.232
I had a coach
throw a shoe at me.

10:15.234 --> 10:16.533
Kid was still in it.

10:18.003 --> 10:20.603
I promised myself I would
never be like that, okay?

10:20.605 --> 10:23.305
My dad's the reason I stopped playing,
and I don't want to ruin hockey for Boyd.

10:23.307 --> 10:25.006
You won 8-0.
You're not ruining it for Boyd.

10:25.008 --> 10:26.907
You're ruining it for the kids
on the other team.

10:26.909 --> 10:28.141
I'm sorry.

10:28.143 --> 10:29.575
I just can't do it, okay?
I quit.

10:29.577 --> 10:31.276
You can say that
as many times as you want,

10:31.278 --> 10:32.744
I'm not putting that
on a t-shirt.

10:32.746 --> 10:34.645
(sighs)

10:34.647 --> 10:36.580
Sounds like you're a sponsor
without a coach.

10:36.582 --> 10:37.948
Yeah, I mean --

10:37.950 --> 10:39.316
(stammering)

10:39.318 --> 10:41.584
You know, Chuck...

10:41.586 --> 10:42.818
This is gonna sound like

10:42.820 --> 10:44.319
I don't have
another alternative...

10:44.321 --> 10:46.454
(laughs) Why not?

10:46.456 --> 10:50.858
The world just might be ready
for a black hockey coach.

10:51.760 --> 10:55.094
♪♪

10:56.630 --> 10:59.530
Hi. Hey. How was skiing?

10:59.532 --> 11:02.199
If you remember,
it really wasn't about skiing.

11:03.001 --> 11:05.768
In my mind, it was --
and in your father's,

11:05.770 --> 11:08.704
which is why I hid those skis
you left behind.

11:08.706 --> 11:11.807
Aww, thank you.
That's so nice.

11:11.809 --> 11:15.509
Ehh, are we having fondue?
Because I say fon-don't.

11:17.212 --> 11:19.145
It's not fondue.
It's an experiment.

11:19.147 --> 11:20.446
Eve and her lab partner

11:20.448 --> 11:22.347
are having trouble
with chemistry.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.882
You know, I don't know
if he's lazy or just dumb.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.516
Or hot.

11:26.518 --> 11:27.817
(scoffs)
You know, Mandy,

11:27.819 --> 11:29.385
you always think
it's about a boy.

11:29.387 --> 11:30.986
It's<i> always</i> about a boy,
Mom.

11:30.988 --> 11:32.854
That's why
you had to hide my skis.

11:35.391 --> 11:37.491
You know, that is
an interesting hypothesis.

11:37.493 --> 11:39.459
Yeah, use all the nerd words
you want.

11:39.461 --> 11:41.893
The subject is love.

11:43.329 --> 11:45.028
CHUCK: (laughs)

11:45.030 --> 11:46.696
Hey!
How'd you guys do?

11:46.698 --> 11:48.564
We tied.
Yeah!

11:48.566 --> 11:50.899
VANESSA: Wow!
The perfect ending!

11:50.901 --> 11:52.734
Nobody's feelings got hurt!

11:54.738 --> 11:58.339
What kind of a Marine
<i> are</i> you?

11:58.341 --> 12:01.008
This isn't war.
This is kid's hockey.

12:01.010 --> 12:02.743
You should have seen
those little guys --

12:02.745 --> 12:04.811
racing one way, then racing the other way.
VANESSA: Aww.

12:04.813 --> 12:06.345
(laughs)

12:06.347 --> 12:08.046
So it sounds like
everybody had a good time.

12:08.048 --> 12:09.714
Yeah,
why focus on winning?

12:09.716 --> 12:11.882
Just gets in the way
of racing one way

12:11.884 --> 12:13.316
and racing the other way.

12:13.318 --> 12:14.583
Come on.

12:14.585 --> 12:16.251
Hey, Vanessa's right, man!

12:16.253 --> 12:17.685
It should be about fun,

12:17.687 --> 12:20.521
and nobody had more fun
than this little guy,

12:20.523 --> 12:21.855
am I right, boy?

12:21.857 --> 12:24.057
Yeah.
Yeah! (laughs)

12:24.059 --> 12:29.395
Undefeated, unstoppable!
Unhurt feelings!

12:29.397 --> 12:31.029
Say hi to your wife.
All right.

12:31.031 --> 12:32.263
Okay, this is great.

12:32.265 --> 12:33.697
I think
everyone is happier

12:33.699 --> 12:35.498
now that Chuck
is coaching the team.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.132
I want to quit.

12:38.101 --> 12:40.034
Oh, looky there.

12:40.036 --> 12:42.770
He's picked up
his dad's catchphrases.

12:51.113 --> 12:52.412
MIKE: (laughs)

12:52.414 --> 12:53.913
Nothing says,
"I quit something"

12:53.915 --> 12:55.848
like continuing to do it.

12:55.850 --> 12:57.449
That would have made
a great slogan

12:57.451 --> 12:59.617
for one of those old
cigarette commercials, huh?

13:01.087 --> 13:02.953
Why did you want to quit?

13:02.955 --> 13:05.522
'Cause we didn't win.

13:05.524 --> 13:07.990
Well, you can have just
as much fun when you tie.

13:10.761 --> 13:13.061
Yeah, I didn't believe it
when I said it, either.

13:13.063 --> 13:14.796
Is Coach Larabee
a good coach?

13:14.798 --> 13:16.297
He's really nice.

13:16.299 --> 13:18.632
That would be a "no."

13:18.634 --> 13:20.700
Why can't my dad coach us?

13:20.702 --> 13:22.134
Because a lot of people
think it upsets you

13:22.136 --> 13:23.401
when he yells.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.202
I don't care.

13:25.204 --> 13:28.104
He just wanted to win,
like I do.

13:28.106 --> 13:30.306
If I could get your dad
to coach,

13:30.308 --> 13:31.707
would you play again?

13:31.709 --> 13:33.208
Do you think you can?

13:33.210 --> 13:35.443
Of course I can.
I like to win, too.

13:35.445 --> 13:36.744
I'm your grandpa.

13:36.746 --> 13:38.212
Where do you think
you get it from?

13:38.214 --> 13:39.479
Oh,
way to look over there.

13:39.481 --> 13:40.947
Stop!

13:40.949 --> 13:42.415
Huh?

13:42.417 --> 13:46.018
♪♪

13:48.155 --> 13:49.521
Where's all the lab stuff?

13:50.624 --> 13:52.557
Have you finally
given up on me?

13:52.559 --> 13:54.458
No.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.626
Today,
we are going to talk about

13:56.628 --> 13:59.729
the practical applications
of the scientific method.

13:59.731 --> 14:01.564
Hmm, well,
this should be quick.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.999
Sit.

14:04.935 --> 14:07.168
Why would Eve,
who is very smart,

14:07.170 --> 14:08.802
be struggling in a class?

14:08.804 --> 14:10.837
I pose this hypothesis.
Mm-hmm.

14:10.839 --> 14:14.940
If Eve's ability to focus
has been compromised,

14:14.942 --> 14:16.641
then perhaps,

14:16.643 --> 14:19.810
she is attracted
to her lab partner, Scott.

14:19.812 --> 14:22.078
Hmm...

14:22.080 --> 14:23.612
I've got a good one.

14:23.614 --> 14:26.114
<i> If</i> Eve's mother
is annoying,

14:26.116 --> 14:28.182
<i> then</i> Eve
will leave the room.

14:28.184 --> 14:30.184
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

14:30.186 --> 14:32.652
I did my research
on the Facebook...

14:34.088 --> 14:38.089
...and confirmed
that Scott is indeed

14:38.091 --> 14:41.759
a very handsome
lacrosse player.

14:41.761 --> 14:43.360
I have
another hypothesis.

14:43.362 --> 14:46.863
A grandma
going on the Facebook

14:46.865 --> 14:48.464
to check out
high-school seniors

14:48.466 --> 14:49.832
is creepy!

14:50.835 --> 14:54.369
I also noticed
that you liked Scott's post

14:54.371 --> 14:56.337
supporting gun control,

14:56.339 --> 14:57.871
unusual for a girl

14:57.873 --> 15:01.140
who can assemble an M16
with her eyes closed.

15:01.142 --> 15:03.809
I only<i> liked</i>
that he has an opinion

15:03.811 --> 15:05.944
on such
an important issue.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.178
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

15:07.180 --> 15:09.013
Continuing my research,

15:09.015 --> 15:10.481
I contacted Cammy

15:10.483 --> 15:13.383
to see if she thinks
Scott is cute.

15:13.385 --> 15:15.051
Okay,
now I have to move.

15:15.053 --> 15:16.352
Why would you do that?

15:16.354 --> 15:18.854
Control group.

15:18.856 --> 15:22.690
But I still felt I needed
one more piece of evidence

15:22.692 --> 15:24.491
to prove my hypothesis.

15:24.493 --> 15:25.725
Like what?

15:25.727 --> 15:27.827
(singsong)
Eve likes Scott.

15:27.829 --> 15:30.529
Eve likes Scott.

15:30.531 --> 15:33.131
(normal voice)
Ha! You blushed!

15:33.133 --> 15:34.365
(chuckles)

15:34.367 --> 15:36.166
Hypothesis proven.

15:36.168 --> 15:39.569
You have just been
Bill Nye-ilated.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.507
Just when I thought science
couldn't get any dorkier.

15:44.509 --> 15:47.710
Sorry, Eve. You like him.

15:47.712 --> 15:50.379
It has been
scientifically proven.

15:50.381 --> 15:52.147
All right, fine.
You got me.

15:52.149 --> 15:54.415
So what am I supposed to do
about Scott?

15:54.417 --> 15:55.983
You know,
this might surprise you,

15:55.985 --> 15:57.584
but I'm actually
more concerned

15:57.586 --> 15:59.519
with what you're gonna
do about chemistry. Ugh.

15:59.521 --> 16:01.354
If I just knew
if he liked me or not,

16:01.356 --> 16:03.522
I could focus and ace it like
all my other classes. Yeah.

16:03.524 --> 16:07.025
Well, you probably
shouldn't be asking for advice

16:07.027 --> 16:10.495
from someone who hasn't had
a crush in 30 years.

16:10.497 --> 16:13.197
That is not true!

16:13.199 --> 16:15.432
Your father and I
happen to be very much in --

16:15.434 --> 16:17.400
Oh, Mom. No, I got it.

16:17.402 --> 16:18.901
But, uh,
you're gonna be happy,

16:18.903 --> 16:20.335
'cause I'm gonna
use science.

16:20.337 --> 16:22.704
All right,
the Scott formula is this --

16:22.706 --> 16:24.739
one part
laughing at his jokes,

16:24.741 --> 16:27.708
two parts sitting through
boring lacrosse games,

16:27.710 --> 16:29.710
and three parts
the right wardrobe.

16:29.712 --> 16:31.878
Your clothes should be
less G.I. Joe,

16:31.880 --> 16:33.279
more, "Gee, I'm a girl."

16:35.349 --> 16:36.715
No, Eve,
just be yourself.

16:36.717 --> 16:38.683
The one thing
I know Scott would respect

16:38.685 --> 16:41.419
is if you work hard and help
him get through chemistry.

16:41.421 --> 16:43.187
I appreciate it, Mom.
I do.

16:43.189 --> 16:44.588
But, uh, this is sort of
Mandy's domain.

16:44.590 --> 16:46.256
Okay, we have a lot more
to get through,

16:46.258 --> 16:47.557
but remember,
he's more scared of you

16:47.559 --> 16:49.425
than you are of him.
He better be.

16:49.427 --> 16:52.261
No, see, that's the sort of
thing we need to work on.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.734
I want you to come back
and coach Boyd's hockey team.

16:59.736 --> 17:01.435
We've been through this,
okay?

17:01.437 --> 17:03.537
When it comes to hockey, I'm
sort of like Jekyll and Hyde.

17:03.539 --> 17:06.273
Jekyll was a doctor.
Let's not get carried away.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.875
I've got this
Bruce Banner-Hulk thing.

17:08.877 --> 17:11.444
Again, another doctor.

17:11.446 --> 17:14.380
You need a before-and-after
that starts with

17:14.382 --> 17:16.982
a mild-mannered,
stay-at-home mom-dad.

17:16.984 --> 17:19.417
Look, I don't want to be
my father, okay?

17:19.419 --> 17:20.651
All he did was yell.

17:20.653 --> 17:23.086
When he was coaching you.
Yes.

17:23.088 --> 17:24.921
And at other times, too.

17:24.923 --> 17:26.289
When you're not coaching Boyd,

17:26.291 --> 17:27.757
do you yell at him?
No, never.

17:27.759 --> 17:29.225
Then how do you think
you're like your dad?

17:29.227 --> 17:31.160
Don't yell at me!

17:31.162 --> 17:33.729
Your dad yelled at you
because he was angry.

17:33.731 --> 17:36.431
You yell because
you're passionate about hockey.

17:36.433 --> 17:38.065
Your kid will know
the difference.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.800
Look, I appreciate
what you're saying,

17:39.802 --> 17:41.802
but I really think
he's better off with Chuck.

17:41.804 --> 17:44.237
He's not better off with Chuck.
He wants to quit.

17:44.239 --> 17:45.605
What? Why?

17:45.607 --> 17:47.640
Because he doesn't think
Coach Larabee cares,

17:47.642 --> 17:49.174
and I have to agree
with him.

17:49.176 --> 17:51.109
I've never seen a guy
so happy about a tie.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.144
My Predators tied?
How could you let that happen?

17:53.146 --> 17:56.247
Hey, don't yell at me.
Yell at your team. Coach them!

17:56.249 --> 17:59.817
I don't think this is
the best thing for Boyd and me.

17:59.819 --> 18:02.119
Boyd will be fine.
He's got Baxter blood in him.

18:02.121 --> 18:04.354
We don't crumple
when we're getting yelled at.

18:04.356 --> 18:06.456
Okay,
what about Chuck?

18:06.458 --> 18:08.691
Chuck's been shot at
in Iraq.

18:08.693 --> 18:11.927
He'll be okay being let go
as a volunteer youth coach.

18:11.929 --> 18:13.628
Boyd really wants
to quit?

18:13.630 --> 18:15.129
Yes, he really wants
to quit.

18:15.131 --> 18:17.264
Unless I coach?
Unless you coach.

18:18.433 --> 18:20.166
All right. I'll do it.

18:20.168 --> 18:21.634
All right!

18:21.636 --> 18:23.802
Guess your scarf here's
gonna have to wait

18:23.804 --> 18:25.103
till after the season.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.337
Uh, "A,"
that is a cardigan,

18:27.339 --> 18:29.639
and, "B," I'll have it done
by this weekend.

18:29.641 --> 18:32.041
Who does the knitting
around here?

18:32.043 --> 18:33.609
Jekyll or the hulk?

18:33.611 --> 18:37.512
The mild-mannered,
stay-at-home mom-dad. Great.

18:37.514 --> 18:39.280
Wait,
so what you're telling me is

18:39.282 --> 18:40.981
sometimes people
yell at someone

18:40.983 --> 18:42.215
because they love them.

18:42.217 --> 18:43.883
That's right.

18:43.885 --> 18:46.118
You yell at me a lot.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.586
(scoffs)
Sometimes it's just yelling.

18:50.355 --> 18:54.289
♪♪

18:54.291 --> 18:55.890
Typical.

18:55.892 --> 18:58.459
You can't fire the players,
so you fire the coach.

18:58.461 --> 19:01.195
Look. Look.
I got to be honest with you.

19:01.197 --> 19:03.564
This decision
came from upstairs.

19:03.566 --> 19:05.799
Upstairs?
What -- we're upstairs!

19:05.801 --> 19:07.867
You<i> are</i> upstairs!

19:07.869 --> 19:10.169
Oh, no, no, no.
I mean...

19:10.171 --> 19:12.871
"upstairs."

19:12.873 --> 19:14.872
God told you to do it?

19:16.375 --> 19:17.707
We talk.

19:19.077 --> 19:21.409
But he said
you could keep the hat.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.879
There's the skipper.
How's my new team?

19:24.881 --> 19:26.347
Yeah, doing pretty well.

19:26.349 --> 19:29.149
Although, some of the kids
miss Coach Larabee.

19:29.151 --> 19:31.651
Oh, do they, now?

19:31.653 --> 19:34.086
Yeah, apparently,
he leaves PEZ dispensers

19:34.088 --> 19:35.754
in the penalty box.
Yeah!

19:35.756 --> 19:37.188
Yeah, I thought it might

19:37.190 --> 19:39.557
take the sting
out of getting punished.

19:39.559 --> 19:43.060
Which is why the entire team
was in the penalty box.

19:43.062 --> 19:45.395
Yeah, with all these kids
still learning the game,

19:45.397 --> 19:47.029
I really could use
an assistant.

19:47.031 --> 19:49.264
Huh? Yes.

19:49.266 --> 19:52.000
I am back in the saddle!

19:52.002 --> 19:53.668
Yeah!

19:53.670 --> 19:57.505
Well, technically,
you're the assistant coach.

19:57.507 --> 20:00.174
So you're sitting on
the ass of the horse

20:00.176 --> 20:01.575
with your arms around him.

20:09.051 --> 20:11.551
Okay, so Scott is gonna make
a lot of terrible jokes,

20:11.553 --> 20:13.452
and you're gonna
have to laugh at them,

20:13.454 --> 20:15.220
or he'll find someone else
who will.

20:15.222 --> 20:16.721
So let's hear
your fake laugh.

20:16.723 --> 20:17.955
(clears throat)

20:17.957 --> 20:20.223
(laughs)

20:20.225 --> 20:22.959
Oh, Scott,
man, you're funny.

20:26.197 --> 20:28.430
What are you doing?
What is this?

20:28.432 --> 20:29.898
Hey, I need something. No.

20:29.900 --> 20:31.532
Think more
champagne bubbles

20:31.534 --> 20:33.367
and less like
a deaf donkey, okay?

20:33.369 --> 20:35.035
Like -- (giggles)
Oh, my God.

20:35.037 --> 20:38.371
Scott,
you're so hilarious.

20:38.373 --> 20:40.272
(giggles) No, like a
dumb baby, like --

20:40.274 --> 20:42.641
(both giggling)

20:42.643 --> 20:44.876
What, uh, what are you guys
fake laughing at?

20:44.878 --> 20:47.144
I'm trying to teach Eve for
when she has to talk to Scott.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.879
Oh, oh,
you mean like this?

20:48.881 --> 20:54.483
(giggling wildly)

20:54.485 --> 20:56.384
Like that?

20:56.386 --> 20:57.985
Yeah.

20:57.987 --> 20:59.486
Where'd you learn
to do that?

20:59.488 --> 21:02.021
30 years of practice.
