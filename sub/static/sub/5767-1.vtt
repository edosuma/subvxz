00:10.410 --> 00:13.402
("Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing"
Playing)

00:24.520 --> 00:26.511
(explosion)

00:29.130 --> 00:31.223
* Baby did a bad, bad thing

00:31.260 --> 00:34.354
* Baby did a bad,
bad thing *

00:34.400 --> 00:37.722
* Baby did a bad, bad thing

00:37.770 --> 00:39.397
* Baby did a bad,
bad thing... *

00:39.440 --> 00:41.590
MAN:
It was e-r_nai|ed
to campus Inboxes.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.232
Do you know who sent it?

00:43.270 --> 00:45.738
My guess is Tau Kappa Theta,
the Jewish fraternity.

00:45.770 --> 00:47.829
I'm not saying anything bad.
No, of course not.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.246
MAN: I just think it was this
video that provoked the fight

00:50.280 --> 00:52.475
at the interfaith rally.
And you want us to defend...?

00:52.520 --> 00:53.748
Jimal Mifsud.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.248
Scholarship student
in Science.

00:56.290 --> 00:59.088
His family is in Jiddah,
and he can't afford a lawyer.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.382
Do you know his family?

01:00.420 --> 01:01.557
No, I am purely

01:01.590 --> 01:04.627
an interested bystander here
who wants to see justice done.

01:04.660 --> 01:05.627
Pu rely?

01:05.660 --> 01:08.549
There's a campus fistfight

01:08.600 --> 01:10.727
between a dozen Palestinian
and Jewish youths,

01:10.770 --> 01:11.794
and the State's Attorney

01:11.830 --> 01:13.798
only charges
one Palestinian?

01:13.840 --> 01:16.138
Well, he doesn't have a record,

01:16.170 --> 01:18.331
so it should be a simple
misdemeanor battery.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.531
Court supervision, at most.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.606
No, the new State's
Attorney wants to appear
tough on his first day.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.208
It was deemed a hate crime.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.717
Seven years.

01:26.750 --> 01:30.811
Alicia, meet Wasim Al-Said, an
old friend who until recently

01:30.850 --> 01:33.751
retained our competitor
Young, Bachman and Meyers

01:33.790 --> 01:36.327
for his legal interest.
To my eternal regret.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.659
Very nice to meet
you, Mrs. Florrick.
Alicia's fine.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.760
Your husband was very good
to the Muslim community
in his first term.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.290
My fear is, that's changed.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.661
Of course, Alicia can't

01:45.700 --> 01:47.736
influence her husband
In any way,

01:47.770 --> 01:49.863
but she is still one
of our best lavwers.

01:49.910 --> 01:53.277
Well, that's all Jimal needs.
This is a good kid

01:53.310 --> 01:54.777
they're painting
as a suicide bomber.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.698
Bond hearing's today.
I'll be there.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.218
Good, that's one piece of
business.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.788
What else might we handle that
Young, Bachman and Meyers can't?

02:02.820 --> 02:05.584
I know that Eli Gold is
working with you these days?

02:05.620 --> 02:08.259
I'm _in need of some
cnsrs management.

02:08.290 --> 02:10.724
What's the crisis?
Where's the management?

02:10.760 --> 02:12.899
Will you get, uh, Eli for us?

02:12.930 --> 02:16.229
And ask Will
to step In.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.795
Will? Sure.

02:24.510 --> 02:27.399
ASSISTANT:
He's late.
Overslept.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.840
Must be from celebrating
yesterday's victory.
Must be.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.507
GRACE:
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.

02:31.550 --> 02:32.517
Hey, Mom, pick up...

02:32.550 --> 02:33.847
Hello, dearest daughter.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.848
You sound happy.
I am happy.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.780
I have my daughter on the phone.
What more could I desire?

02:37.820 --> 02:40.516
Look, I don't think
I need a tutor.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.551
Grace, we discussed this.
It's just a month.

02:42.590 --> 02:45.229
Yeah, but it was
one report card.
And it's one month.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.194
Dad just thinks
I need to apply myself.

02:47.230 --> 02:49.721
Oh, I agree, and a tutor will
help you do that.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.226
Eli? The meeting.

02:51.270 --> 02:54.865
Mom, Nisa's parents want you
to come over for dinner.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.232
You and Dad. Both of you.
Why?

02:57.270 --> 02:58.862
Just to be nice.
I didn't tell them anything.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.798
It was like you said;
I haven't let anyone know

03:00.840 --> 03:02.034
you guys are separated.
Hey!

03:02.080 --> 03:04.674
Okay, I'll talk to your father
about it. I-I've got to go.

03:04.710 --> 03:05.972
So, who is this guy again?

03:06.010 --> 03:07.511
Wasim Al-Said.

03:07.550 --> 03:08.847
He's a commodities trader.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.381
Wasim?

03:10.420 --> 03:12.479
Diane's been trying to sign him
for two years.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.648
He has ten million in
charitable assets to spend.

03:15.690 --> 03:16.554
On what?

03:16.590 --> 03:20.424
A campaign against
anti-Muslim bigotry.

03:23.600 --> 03:28.299
Mr. Al-Said, you do know that
I'm not a PR specialist.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.262
I handle lobbying
and crisis management.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.868
Do you watch the
evening news, Eli?

03:31.910 --> 03:34.799
Religiously.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.844
Then you know there was a murder
of a Jewish poli sci major

03:38.880 --> 03:40.609
at Chicago Polytech
last night.

03:40.650 --> 03:44.643
Unsolved, but the police are
questioning Muslim students.

03:44.690 --> 03:47.853
Ten minutes later, a riot broke
out at the other end of campus

03:47.890 --> 03:51.428
at a rally intended to encourage
interfaith dialogue,

03:51.460 --> 03:53.758
and only one Muslim
was arrested.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.826
Now I'm used to reading the
tea leaves in this country,

03:56.870 --> 03:59.839
and the best way to manage a
crisis is before it becomes one.

03:59.870 --> 04:01.269
Isn't that true?

04:01.300 --> 04:02.801
It is.

04:02.840 --> 04:07.709
So, are you hiring me because
I'm good or because I'm Jewish?

04:07.740 --> 04:09.901
Because I imagine it
might look quite good

04:09.950 --> 04:12.271
having a Jew campaign
for Muslims.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.869
Can't it be both?

04:15.920 --> 04:18.480
I don't like being used.
Really? Since when?

04:18.520 --> 04:21.318
He knows Jewish money is going
to Peter for his next campaign

04:21.360 --> 04:23.828
and he wants
to buy Influence.
And...?

04:23.860 --> 04:27.455
Don't you get
so knowing on me.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.661
What's up with you, anyway?

04:29.700 --> 04:31.361
You seem different.
(scoffs)

04:31.400 --> 04:32.833
Where you going?

04:32.870 --> 04:34.428
Court.
Why?

04:34.470 --> 04:35.937
I'm a lawyer.

04:35.970 --> 04:38.359
Okay, glad we cleared that up.

04:38.410 --> 04:39.877
This is a hate crime,
Your Honor,

04:39.910 --> 04:42.401
and we ask that bail be set
at $100,000.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.010
Have you ever been in
a fistfight, Counselor?

04:45.050 --> 04:47.848
Have I, Your Honor?
Uh, no.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.541
Well, let me educate you.

04:49.590 --> 04:53.959
It's chaos, chaos in there.
No one can tell who hits who.

04:53.990 --> 04:55.389
Fists are flying, you
get hit in the head.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.785
The next thing you know,
you're on the ground
and somebody's jumping...

04:56.830 --> 04:59.856
Jimal, I'm sorry to
be late. I was...
CARY: Jimal assaulted someone

04:59.900 --> 05:02.027
because he was Jewish.
That is not chaos, Your Honor.

05:02.060 --> 05:04.597
And Jimal was hit because he's
Palestinian, Your Honor.

05:04.630 --> 05:05.722
Alicia Florrick,
Your Honor.

05:05.770 --> 05:07.328
20 students were fighting.

05:07.370 --> 05:08.997
Only one was charged.
One Muslim.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.964
His religion had nothing to...
It had everything
to do with it.

05:12.010 --> 05:13.898
JUDGE:
All right, okay, your passion
is preserved for the record.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.976
Bond is set at $5,000.

05:16.010 --> 05:19.047
And I do suggest that the
State reconsider its charge.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.741
Thank you, Your Honor.

05:20.780 --> 05:21.872
(gavel pounds)

05:21.920 --> 05:23.911
Jimal, I was
just put in on this.

05:23.950 --> 05:26.043
You have a benefactor
who asked me to step in.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.752
Are you all right?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.758
I know, a lot of this is
posturing by the prosecution

05:30.790 --> 05:32.826
to get you to accept
a higher plea.

05:32.860 --> 05:35.920
The good news is,
the judge is on your side.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.928
Now, do you want me to call
your parents or anything?

05:37.970 --> 05:40.530
No, no they wouldn't...
Look, I'm ashamed.

05:40.570 --> 05:43.607
I understand. Hopefully,
we can handle this

05:43.640 --> 05:46.734
by admitting simple battery.
But I didn't...
I wasn't even there.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.768
He wasn't at the rally, Cary.
He was at the library.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.370
Oh, my God, really?
That's terrible.

05:54.420 --> 05:58.379
This isn't about Jimal,
and this isn't about
some stupid fistfight.

05:58.420 --> 06:00.149
This is about that Jewish
kid stabbed to death,

06:00.190 --> 06:03.057
and you can't find the killer
so Jimal is the scapegoat.

06:03.090 --> 06:05.479
We have an eyewitness who saw
Jimal throw the first punch.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.498
That's what this is about.
Is the eyewitness Caucasian?

06:07.530 --> 06:08.758
(laughs)

06:08.800 --> 06:12.099
Oh, wow, how quickly we slip the
bonds of political correctness.

06:12.130 --> 06:14.633
Why not ask if he's Jewish?
Cross-racial
identification.

06:14.670 --> 06:16.069
Caucasians have difficulty

06:16.100 --> 06:18.102
discerning unique
characteristics.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.529
Six months in County,
one year probation.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.877
No.

06:21.910 --> 06:23.502
Then I'll see you in court.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.541
Tell Peter there has
to be a better way

06:25.580 --> 06:26.945
to firm up his campaign
contributions.

06:26.980 --> 06:28.971
Using everything we can, are we?

06:29.020 --> 06:30.988
PETER:
It's a new day.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.011
We're running a clean office.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.652
Let me say that again, because

06:34.690 --> 06:37.124
we're all prone to
the same cynicism.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.948
We... are running
a clean office.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.822
Clean, ethical, honest,
but not weak.

06:44.870 --> 06:47.134
I know our budgets
have been slashed.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.569
I know we're the underdog here.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.909
But our strategy will be this:

06:50.940 --> 06:52.498
no plea bargains.

06:52.540 --> 06:54.132
That's right.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.978
Defense attorneys will be
expecting the opposite.

06:57.010 --> 06:58.568
So for the next two months,

06:58.610 --> 07:02.114
I want you to hold the line
on every single plea.

07:02.150 --> 07:04.118
After that, you won't have
to work as hard.

07:04.150 --> 07:06.015
You get your enemy flinching,

07:06.050 --> 07:07.711
you'll never have to hit him
hard again.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.150
Your first complaint will be
about investigator hours.

07:11.190 --> 07:13.897
That's why I've hired
an outside contractor

07:13.930 --> 07:16.091
until we can budget full time.

07:16.130 --> 07:17.620
I want you to meet Sophia Russo.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.160
She's good,
and she's cheap.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.235
Thanks!

07:20.270 --> 07:21.931
Relatively.

07:21.970 --> 07:23.608
Mr. Florrick, I offered
the defense six months

07:23.640 --> 07:25.107
on the college hate crime.
Should I walk it back?

07:25.140 --> 07:27.472
What's the law say?

07:27.510 --> 07:28.477
Three to seven years.

07:28.510 --> 07:29.647
There's your answer.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.170
The lawyer's Alicia,

07:31.210 --> 07:33.644
and she might come after
your campaign contributions.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.739
Really?

07:35.780 --> 07:38.146
Yeah. What do you want?

07:38.190 --> 07:40.078
Follow the law.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.111
You can't go wrong
if you follow the law.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.151
All right.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.221
Geez, what a pit.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.090
Thank you.
You're working on the, uh,

07:52.130 --> 07:54.064
the Jewish-Muslim thing, right?

07:54.100 --> 07:56.739
Yeah, the hate crime.
Why? What do you need?

07:56.770 --> 07:58.101
Oh, it's not what I need.

07:58.140 --> 08:00.734
What is this?

08:02.180 --> 08:05.604
You used to work with
Kalinda Sharma, didn't you?

08:05.650 --> 08:07.140
Yeah.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.740
If I were you,
I'd slip it to her.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.108
*

08:17.060 --> 08:21.622
So, kind of odd not
seeing you around much.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.128
Yeah, I've been busy.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.229
Yeah.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.966
And here I thought you
didn't need me anymore.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.206
(chuckles)

08:33.040 --> 08:35.031
What's that?

08:36.110 --> 08:37.839
It's a peace offering.

08:37.880 --> 08:41.839
Peter Florrick wants
to run a clean office, so...

08:41.880 --> 08:43.245
this is me being clean.

08:47.190 --> 08:48.817
You're welcome.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.128
ELI:
You can't make
Chicagoans feel

08:53.160 --> 08:56.129
good about Islam with pathos.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.764
You need to go positive.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.190
Link the Arab Spring
to the American Revolution.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.162
Who is the Islamic
George Washington?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.735
Who is the Islamic
Paul Revere?

09:05.770 --> 09:09.206
Morning in
the Middle East...

09:09.240 --> 09:10.901
Do you need something?

09:10.950 --> 09:13.043
It's on your desk.
It's self-explanatory.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.120
ALICIA:
That's your car?

09:28.760 --> 09:32.161
Good. Now, I know you said
you were at the library.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.736
But the time code

09:33.770 --> 09:36.898
on that traffic light shows
that the driver of your car

09:36.940 --> 09:37.929
was running a red light

09:37.970 --> 09:41.269
just outside the campus
gates at the exact moment

09:41.310 --> 09:43.369
of the interfaith rally.

09:43.410 --> 09:46.174
That means that the driver
of your car, If that IS you,

09:46.210 --> 09:49.111
couldn't have been involved
in the rally fight.

09:49.150 --> 09:50.947
Do you understand?

09:50.990 --> 09:52.014
I do.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.712
So, I want you to take your time
before you answer.

10:00.130 --> 10:03.395
Is that you driving your car?

10:03.430 --> 10:05.193
It is.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.834
Are you certain, young man?

10:06.870 --> 10:09.668
It's a very roundabout way
to come from the library.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.836
I'm sure.

10:10.870 --> 10:14.101
CARY:
We ask that Mr. Mifsud
state under oath that he was

10:14.140 --> 10:16.370
the driver in this photo
which we will mark as
People's Exhibit #1.

10:16.410 --> 10:19.277
Your Honor, is that
really necessary?

10:19.310 --> 10:20.971
CARY:
It's the only way
we'll drop the hate charge.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.217
Very well.
Mr. Mifsud, you are under oath.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.241
Do you swear that
that's you in the photo?

10:28.260 --> 10:29.215
Yes.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.649
JUDGE:
Good. Well, I think
that just about, uh,

10:31.690 --> 10:34.295
wraps it up, doesn't it,
Mr. Agos? I'm late for the gym.

10:34.330 --> 10:37.060
It does, Your Honor,
and the State has made
a terrible mistake

10:37.100 --> 10:39.227
in charging Mr. Mifsud
with this battery.

10:39.270 --> 10:42.728
But this car with this license
plate was seen racmg away

10:42.770 --> 10:45.967
from the scene of the frat
murder of Simon Greenberg...
Objection, Your Honor!

10:46.010 --> 10:49.104
That is why he ran
the red light.
Oh, this is outrageous.

10:49.140 --> 10:51.847
He had just killed
Simon Greenberg.
This is
prosecutorial misconduct.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.416
He swore to it. His alibi means
he committed this murder.

10:53.450 --> 10:56.374
Because you overcharged
him with a hate crime so he
would grab at any alibi.

10:56.420 --> 10:57.944
So you're saying your client
perjured himself?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.958
No, I am saying he took
my advice, that's all.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.412
Well, then
congratulations, Alicia.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.280
You just advised your client
to admit to murder.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.288
Your Honor,
the People charge Jimal Mifsud

11:06.330 --> 11:08.059
with ﬁrst-degree murder.

11:25.180 --> 11:27.171
(elevator bell dings)

11:31.220 --> 11:33.154
Alicia dropped
by for you.

11:33.190 --> 11:34.316
Why?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.987
I don't know. You
want me to get her?

11:36.020 --> 11:37.123
No. Later.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.422
KALIN DA:
So this isn't you?

11:38.460 --> 11:40.325
It's your car,
but you're not driving it?

11:40.360 --> 11:44.763
I'm sorry, I, uh, I thought
it was the easiest way out.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.427
So who is it?
Who's driving it?

11:46.470 --> 11:47.562
I don't know.

11:47.600 --> 11:52.060
Jimal, they have a witness
who swears that that car--

11:52.110 --> 11:55.978
your car-- was driven away
by Simon Greenberg's killer.

11:56.010 --> 11:57.341
So don't cover for anyone.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.779
I'm not covering.

11:58.810 --> 12:01.370
My-My two roommates
don't have a car,

12:01.420 --> 12:02.887
I let Amir a_nd
TarIq use mine.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.319
I just leave my
keys in the room.

12:04.350 --> 12:06.284
So which is driving it,
Amir or Tariq?

12:08.890 --> 12:11.381
I don't know.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.398
But he swore that was him
drIVIng away from the murder?

12:13.430 --> 12:14.954
_ He_didn't know it would
Implicate him In a murder.

12:15.000 --> 12:15.955
It's my fault.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.069
I encouraged him
to place himself

12:17.100 --> 12:19.421
in the car to give him an alibi
from the hate crime.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.768
Yes. And now I have
a multimillion-dollar client

12:21.800 --> 12:22.869
thinking that we're amateurs.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.231
I got the pictures
from the ASA's office.

12:25.270 --> 12:27.170
I should've checked.
Great.

12:27.210 --> 12:28.177
It's everybody's fault.

12:28.210 --> 12:29.404
Now let's make it right.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.374
I'm questioning
Jimal's roommates.

12:31.410 --> 12:32.877
One of them is the real driver.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.444
And I'm filing a motion
to dismiss

12:34.480 --> 12:36.141
Jimal_'s alibi statement
during preliminary.

12:36.180 --> 12:38.546
I don't know what's
going on with you two,

12:38.590 --> 12:41.150
but make it better.

12:41.190 --> 12:42.214
Whatever you have to do.

12:42.260 --> 12:43.249
Make it better.

13:04.580 --> 13:06.400
So are we supposed
to do something?

13:06.450 --> 13:08.577
Sure.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.417
What subject?
I don't know.

13:10.450 --> 13:12.509
You're the tutor.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.256
What does
your mom want?

13:14.290 --> 13:15.814
She wants me
to get better grades,

13:15.860 --> 13:17.179
so that I'll get
into Briarcrest.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.050
You don't like
public school?

13:19.090 --> 13:20.489
No, I do.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.452
It's just that there was
a mugging on the field,

13:22.500 --> 13:25.424
and all the parents
got really scared.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.938
Is this your first job tutoring?

13:29.970 --> 13:32.006
Yeah.
(chuckles)

13:32.040 --> 13:33.507
How am I doing?

13:33.540 --> 13:34.472
Not so good.

13:34.510 --> 13:36.330
Darn.

13:40.350 --> 13:42.614
Can we go outside?

13:42.650 --> 13:45.847
Yeah, I think it's up to you.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.549
MAN:
Cary the man!

13:51.590 --> 13:53.490
Throwing down
that opposition.

13:53.530 --> 13:55.521
(chuckles)

13:57.630 --> 13:59.962
Nicely played.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.592
Thanks.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.267
So this is the new Cary?

14:03.310 --> 14:05.961
No, just a new day.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.939
_ So can I see
the crime scene photos, Cary?

14:10.980 --> 14:13.448
Well, come on.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.573
You're in the big leagues now.
What can it hurt?

14:15.620 --> 14:17.485
I'll think about it.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.408
SOPHIA:
Oh.

14:19.450 --> 14:20.986
Well, loolq
who's here.

14:21.020 --> 14:21.987
Sophia?

14:22.020 --> 14:23.419
In the flesh.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.525
Strange bedfellows, huh?

14:27.560 --> 14:29.892
The strangest.

14:29.930 --> 14:32.364
Well...

14:32.400 --> 14:34.163
you two have a nice time.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.307
(chuckles)

14:42.310 --> 14:44.346
What'd she want?

14:44.380 --> 14:45.904
(sighs):
Oh.

14:45.950 --> 14:47.941
Crime scene photos.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.915
Damn it.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.259
Okay, uh, Simon Greenberg, 22,

14:58.290 --> 15:00.349
found in his dorm room gagged,

15:00.400 --> 15:03.460
hands bound, stabbed 45 times.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.990
Little overkill?
Yep.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.292
Police think it was
an execution.

15:06.330 --> 15:07.490
No sign of a struggle.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.495
Any witnesses?

15:08.540 --> 15:09.461
Neighbor heard a scream,

15:09.500 --> 15:10.967
looked out his window and saw

15:11.010 --> 15:13.069
a dark, possibly black
Middle Eastern man

15:13.110 --> 15:14.134
running to his car.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.603
They got a number plate-- ET27.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.948
Damn.

15:17.980 --> 15:19.402
That's not a partial plate.

15:19.450 --> 15:20.439
Yeah, I know.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.447
Jimal's plate.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.447
Um, one other thing.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.038
Something that wasn't
released to the press.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.045
What?

15:25.090 --> 15:26.717
Killer drew a swastika

15:26.750 --> 15:28.183
with the victim's blood.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.152
Ugh.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.954
Yep. I know this is not
looking good, is it?

15:31.990 --> 15:33.594
Okay, um,

15:33.630 --> 15:36.497
let me know what you get
from the roommates.

15:36.530 --> 15:38.191
Got it.

15:38.230 --> 15:41.393
Oh, by the way, the swastika--
the police don't know why,

15:41.440 --> 15:43.101
but it was drawn backwards.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.608
Okay.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.676
Hi.

15:47.710 --> 15:49.132
Am I interrupting?

15:49.180 --> 15:50.738
Nope.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.510
How are you?

15:53.550 --> 15:54.972
Good.

15:57.650 --> 15:59.242
Do you have a moment to talk?

16:02.620 --> 16:04.281
About last night?

16:04.330 --> 16:05.649
Yeah.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.597
Don't act like
this is nothing, Eli.

16:10.630 --> 16:12.166
You're running
a pro-Palestinian campaign.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.167
It's an anti-

16:13.200 --> 16:16.636
Muslim-bigotry campaign,
and I am a crisis man...

16:16.670 --> 16:18.001
You are a Jew.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.530
We are both...
Oh, come on, Michael!

16:19.570 --> 16:21.299
What is this?

16:21.340 --> 16:23.001
Ultimate Frisbee?

16:23.050 --> 16:25.143
We only win by
making them lose?

16:25.180 --> 16:26.477
Yes.

16:26.510 --> 16:28.046
You act like you're not
paying attention,

16:28.080 --> 16:29.570
but I know you're
paying attention.

16:29.620 --> 16:30.780
This is a PR war.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.412
And I'm a traitor?

16:32.450 --> 16:33.712
In February, Israeli soldiers

16:33.760 --> 16:35.182
helped a Palestinian woman
give birth.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.051
You didn't read about it
unless you subscribed

16:37.090 --> 16:38.352
to the Israel National News.

16:38.390 --> 16:39.584
Two days later, an Israeli woman

16:39.630 --> 16:41.097
gave birth in
a Palestinian hospital.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.290
Where did you read it?

16:42.330 --> 16:44.560
AP, CBS News,
every major paper.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.692
Google it. Go ahead.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.595
This is a PR war
and they are winning.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.561
Michael.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.329
I do not go to your house

16:51.370 --> 16:53.679
and tell you
what novels to write.

16:53.710 --> 16:55.302
I do not go to your committee

16:55.340 --> 16:57.547
and tell you
what lobbyists to hire.

16:57.580 --> 16:58.547
(gasps)

16:58.580 --> 16:59.740
Oh.

16:59.780 --> 17:01.372
That's it.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.285
(chuckles):
Now I get it.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.480
I didn't hire you.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.487
There it is.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.351
I hired _
Tarkovslq & Assoaates.

17:07.390 --> 17:10.325
With a $20 million Jewish League
Fund to fight intolerance.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.588
Yes, you did.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.497
So this_ isn't
Israel/Palestine to you.

17:14.530 --> 17:15.758
It's Gold versus Tarkovslq.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.166
You're paying a competitor,
Michael.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.667
And as moved as I am

17:19.700 --> 17:20.667
by your plea for

17:20.700 --> 17:21.769
Jewish brotherhood,

17:21.800 --> 17:22.869
I'm not that moved.

17:22.900 --> 17:26.336
4,000 years and we are always
our own worst enemy.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.751
So you were driving Jimal's car
that night, right?

17:45.790 --> 17:47.223
This is just
like the cops.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.488
Racist.

17:48.530 --> 17:50.361
They think an Arab
had to do it.

17:50.400 --> 17:54.393
Yeah, but this is you,
isn't it, Amir?

17:54.440 --> 17:56.328
You were driving your roommate's
car that night, right?

17:56.370 --> 17:57.803
No.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.603
And you know why it's not me?

17:59.640 --> 18:01.403
Look at your
time code, lady.

18:01.440 --> 18:05.103
I was in my living room
for salah.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.606
Evening prayers.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.742
Anybody else see you there?

18:07.780 --> 18:08.747
Yes.
VVho?

18:08.780 --> 18:11.681
The Prophet Muhammad.

18:11.720 --> 18:12.709
Peace be upon him.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.380
Yeah, Amir's in the living room

18:15.420 --> 18:16.409
five times a day praying.

18:16.460 --> 18:17.484
Okay, Tariq.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.486
Did you see him praying on
the night of the murder?

18:19.530 --> 18:21.293
No.
So you were home?

18:21.330 --> 18:24.663
You were home to be able
to not see him there?

18:24.700 --> 18:26.327
No, I was out.

18:26.370 --> 18:27.735
In Jimal's car?

18:27.770 --> 18:29.795
No, I wanted to take it,
but the keys were gone already.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.330
So where were you?

18:31.370 --> 18:32.439
I was here.

18:32.470 --> 18:34.779
In the quad
at the interfaith rally.

18:40.350 --> 18:41.817
Sophia.

18:41.850 --> 18:43.681
Kalinda.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.687
Hi.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.846
I didn't see you over there.

18:45.890 --> 18:47.687
This is how you
investigate these days?

18:47.720 --> 18:49.859
By just following me?
Yep.

18:49.890 --> 18:52.688
Makes things a lot easier.

18:52.730 --> 18:54.493
So you and Cary, huh?

18:54.530 --> 18:56.259
That's why you've been
ignoring me, right?

18:56.300 --> 18:59.667
It's not because
I'm married.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.668
Yep. You got me.

19:03.940 --> 19:06.158
Listen, I'm gonna go and
question eyewitnesses

19:06.210 --> 19:07.279
at the Jewish frat.

19:07.310 --> 19:08.572
Do you want
the address?

19:08.610 --> 19:09.929
Where's the fun in that?

19:09.980 --> 19:11.709
ALICIA:
Your Honor, this is...

19:11.750 --> 19:13.445
(lawyers shouting)

19:13.480 --> 19:14.777
This is prosecutorial
misconduct.
Okay, okay, okay.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.310
This is absolutely
unethical.
All right, all right.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.215
Each to your corners.

19:18.250 --> 19:19.740
Mrs. Florrick,
your client

19:19.790 --> 19:21.587
already swore that that
was him in the car.

19:21.620 --> 19:22.951
Is he now trying to
say that he lied?

19:22.990 --> 19:24.753
He's saying that he was misled
by the prosecution.

19:24.790 --> 19:25.757
How did I mislead?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.849
Jimal was given
an opportunity

19:27.900 --> 19:29.390
to avoid a hate crime
prosecution

19:29.430 --> 19:30.624
and he took it, that's all.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.797
This murder charge
is based on nothing else.

19:32.830 --> 19:33.762
There's no evidence that

19:33.800 --> 19:35.893
Jimal and the victim
even knew each other.

19:35.940 --> 19:36.895
Where's the motive?

19:36.940 --> 19:38.532
Mr. Greenberg was Jewish
and Jimal was Muslim,

19:38.570 --> 19:39.798
and as you can see here,
Your Honor,

19:39.840 --> 19:41.273
a swastika was drawn
on the Victim's...

19:41.310 --> 19:42.402
ALICIA:
Oh, come on.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.646
Anti-Semitism isn't

19:43.680 --> 19:45.409
some cookie cutter motive
you can apply

19:45.450 --> 19:46.803
to any dark-skinned...
All right,
counselors, listen.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.670
Nobody likes a street
fight better than me,

19:48.720 --> 19:50.984
but that's for in
the street, not here.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.284
Mr. Agos, do you have any
further probable cause?

19:53.320 --> 19:54.685
Because if it's just
that statement,

19:54.720 --> 19:56.449
I am prone
to overturn.

19:56.490 --> 19:57.650
We do, Your Honor.

19:57.690 --> 19:59.783
FINEMAN:
Professor Noah Fineman.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.821
I teach political science.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.498
And did the accused show
a particular Interest

20:03.530 --> 20:04.497
in one of your lectures?

20:04.530 --> 20:05.622
He did.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.399
It's a lecture that I give

20:07.440 --> 20:09.635
on the anniversary
of 9/11 about

20:09.670 --> 20:11.706
chickens who come home to roost

20:11.740 --> 20:13.799
for the United States and
Zionist regime in Israel...

20:13.840 --> 20:14.636
Objection.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.604
Your Honor,
is Mr. Agos really trying

20:17.650 --> 20:19.948
_to _find a motive
In JImal's classes?

20:19.980 --> 20:21.948
Why not home ec?

20:21.980 --> 20:23.811
Maybe that's where
the knife came from.
JUDGE: Overruled.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.545
I think we can stand a bit

20:25.590 --> 20:27.012
of rough and tumble here,
Counselor.

20:27.050 --> 20:29.553
So, Professor,

20:29.590 --> 20:31.421
you would argue that Israel's
a criminal regime.

20:31.460 --> 20:32.825
Oh, I-I don't argue it.

20:32.860 --> 20:34.851
I think that's
fairly self-evident.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.391
Given this, what do you
think of suicide bombings

20:37.430 --> 20:38.966
and the death of
Jewish citizens?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.467
FINEMAN:
If you're asking me

20:40.500 --> 20:42.832
if I approve of
such a thing, no, never.

20:42.870 --> 20:44.838
But I do understand them.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.861
These are
understandable movements

20:46.910 --> 20:48.707
against a Zionist oppression.

20:48.740 --> 20:51.447
And how did your student Jimal

20:51.480 --> 20:53.869
take an added interest
in this lecture?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.808
Well, he was, uh,

20:55.850 --> 20:57.943
very engaged in class, yes.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.787
And afterwards,
he approached me

20:59.820 --> 21:02.288
to ask me questions
about my newest book,

21:02.320 --> 21:03.685
Zionist Occupation:

21:03.730 --> 21:05.686
the Need for Realignment
and New Thinking.

21:05.730 --> 21:06.754
Bordinay Press.

21:08.460 --> 21:09.256
Thank you, Professor.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.619
No further questions,
Your Honor.

21:11.530 --> 21:12.929
Actually, Professor,

21:12.970 --> 21:14.938
I have _a few
questIons.

21:14.970 --> 21:16.995
My client was very engaged
in your lecture, you said?

21:17.040 --> 21:18.598
How did you
witness this?

21:18.640 --> 21:21.939
Well, if you teach students
long enough, you get a sense.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.709
And for how long
did you teach Jimal?

21:23.750 --> 21:26.969
Well, it's been four weeks since
the beginning of the semester.

21:27.010 --> 21:29.615
So four weeks,
that's, uh, 20 sessions.

21:29.650 --> 21:31.880
And for how many
of those sessions

21:31.920 --> 21:33.956
were you actually present?

21:33.990 --> 21:36.083
I don't understand.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.556
How many of those 20 sessions
were you actually

21:39.590 --> 21:42.491
there teaching and not
having one of your TA's do it?

21:45.030 --> 21:46.895
Uh...
Didn't you only
lecture the class

21:46.930 --> 21:48.932
twice, Professor?

21:48.970 --> 21:51.768
Well, I would question your use
of the word "only,"

21:51.810 --> 21:54.631
but, uh...

21:54.680 --> 21:55.829
yes.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.600
And yet you really focused
with your laser-like perception

21:59.650 --> 22:02.539
_on Jimal and
ms engagement.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.013
You're being a bit rude.

22:04.050 --> 22:06.382
Yes, and I'm just
getting started.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.513
So, after one of your lectures,

22:08.560 --> 22:09.959
Jimal came to you
to ask you about your book.

22:09.990 --> 22:12.049
How do you know this?

22:12.090 --> 22:14.888
Because I keep a record
next to my attendance. See?

22:14.930 --> 22:16.659
That asterisk tells me
that I must send them

22:16.700 --> 22:17.826
an e-mail about my book.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.724
And, of course,
you recognize Jimal,

22:19.770 --> 22:20.759
over there?

22:20.800 --> 22:21.789
Oh, yes.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.932
This record attendance,

22:22.970 --> 22:24.062
the students sign
themselves in, yes?

22:24.110 --> 22:25.566
Yes, it's a very efficient way
to work.

22:25.610 --> 22:26.736
I'm sure.

22:26.770 --> 22:28.032
Do you see Jimal's name there?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.104
It's him there.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.142
That's not his handwriting.
CARY:
Objection.

22:31.180 --> 22:32.442
That's the handwriting
of his roommate,

22:32.480 --> 22:34.744
Tariq, also a student
in your class

22:34.780 --> 22:35.917
who signed him in

22:35.950 --> 22:38.441
so that Jimal
could cut class.

22:43.890 --> 22:47.724
Well, I'd say things
have been pretty easy
for you up until now.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.398
Really?

22:50.430 --> 22:52.068
How's that?

22:52.100 --> 22:54.466
In court, these people don't
really know how you think.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.695
But you do?

22:56.740 --> 22:59.106
Hate to tell you this but
we're going to beat you.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.778
(chuckles softly)

23:00.810 --> 23:02.698
Good luck with that.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.742
(laughs)

23:13.090 --> 23:15.058
(automatic gunfire)

23:15.090 --> 23:16.455
(explosion)

23:16.490 --> 23:18.481
(man shouting
in foreign language)

23:22.630 --> 23:24.097
(gunfire continues)

23:24.130 --> 23:25.427
(man shouting
in foreign language)

23:25.470 --> 23:27.062
(explosion)

23:27.100 --> 23:28.988
Battle M.E.: Gaza Strip.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.166
It's one of my best MMOGs.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.668
And what is an MMOG?

23:32.710 --> 23:35.133
Massive Multiplayer
Online Game.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.671
Meaning people log
onto their computers

23:37.710 --> 23:39.200
and battle each other.
Yep.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.047
What are we looking at now?

23:41.080 --> 23:43.810
Uh, well, that's the recorded
actions of Sampson5.

23:43.850 --> 23:47.081
That's the avatar of
the accused, Jimal...

23:47.120 --> 23:48.451
ALICIA:
Objection.

23:48.490 --> 23:49.718
Your Honor,

23:49.760 --> 23:52.979
what does this have to do with
the death of Simon Greenberg?

23:53.030 --> 23:55.055
Goes to motive, Your Honor.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.590
What is that assault weapon
over there, is that an uzi?

23:56.630 --> 23:58.029
No, it's a Galil 5.56.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.061
JUDGE:
What's the range of fire?

24:00.100 --> 24:01.897
450 meters.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.134
Cool.

24:03.170 --> 24:05.035
Proceed.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.958
Well, that's Jimal's
avatar there.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.875
The guy running.

24:08.910 --> 24:10.502
And what is he wearing?

24:10.550 --> 24:12.745
Oh, that? That's a suicide vest.

24:12.780 --> 24:15.749
(man shouting in foreign
language on video game)

24:15.780 --> 24:18.112
(gunfire and explosions
conﬁnue)

24:19.120 --> 24:20.781
He's wearing a suicide vest?

24:20.820 --> 24:22.788
And what is he entering?

24:22.820 --> 24:25.152
That's a civilian
Israeli building.

24:25.190 --> 24:26.987
That's a school, in fact...

24:27.030 --> 24:28.622
Your Honor, this is a game.

24:28.660 --> 24:30.799
(explosion)

24:30.830 --> 24:32.229
(gunfire and explosions
conﬁnue)

24:35.140 --> 24:37.802
Mr. Al-Said

24:37.840 --> 24:40.058
was just here.

24:40.110 --> 24:41.975
He wants us to pull out
of Jimal's defense.

24:42.010 --> 24:44.501
He is afraid defending
a youth who makes light
of a suicide bombing

24:44.550 --> 24:47.201
will un_dercut Eli'_s
pro-Mus|Im campaIgn.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.274
He wasn't making light of it.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.015
He was playing a video game.

24:50.050 --> 24:52.018
In which he killed
a schoolhouse full of kids.

24:52.050 --> 24:53.711
Yes, but in a video game.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.216
Have you seen video games
lately?

24:55.260 --> 24:56.579
We can't abandon Jimal.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.156
He was looking
at misdemeanor battery.

24:58.190 --> 25:00.158
We helped him into
a murder charge.

25:00.190 --> 25:01.748
"We"?

25:03.870 --> 25:07.226
I... helped him
into a murder charge,

25:07.270 --> 25:08.669
which I did as a representative

25:08.700 --> 25:10.065
of this firm.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.762
We made a commitment
to hIm.

25:12.810 --> 25:14.175
What do you think?

25:14.210 --> 25:17.179
I think your friend will pull
out of Eli's campaign

25:17.210 --> 25:21.112
and go right back to his
old firm with his $10 million.

25:21.150 --> 25:22.742
Yeah.

25:22.780 --> 25:25.146
Still, retail rules.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.181
We broke it, we own it?

25:28.190 --> 25:30.750
Okay, we'll stick with Jimal.

25:30.790 --> 25:32.929
Win this one.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.955
No.

25:37.000 --> 25:37.819
No, what?

25:37.870 --> 25:40.691
No, Mr. Al-Said.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.059
(chuckles)

25:42.100 --> 25:43.806
I'm coming here as a courtesy.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.104
I don't need your campaign
anymore.

25:46.140 --> 25:47.971
I'm taking my business back
to my old firm.

25:48.010 --> 25:50.672
Oh, that's too bad because
I already cashed your check.

25:50.710 --> 25:52.177
You did not.

25:52.210 --> 25:53.711
I did.

25:53.750 --> 25:54.944
You know us Jews.

25:54.980 --> 25:57.141
You'd do anything
to piss me off.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.784
You're right.

25:58.820 --> 26:01.288
But I have still got a great
pro-Muslim campaign for you.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.311
(laughs softly)

26:03.360 --> 26:05.021
Good doing business with you.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.721
Did you hear the one

26:06.760 --> 26:08.352
about the Arab and the Jew?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.719
No.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.796
But I'm sure it's very funny.

26:11.830 --> 26:14.037
An Arab and a Jew
walk into a bar.

26:14.070 --> 26:15.958
And then they kill each other.

26:23.340 --> 26:28.118
Energy is radiated and absorbed
in quanta, matched to...?

26:30.750 --> 26:35.119
Patterns of black body
radiation.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.912
You know that's
bad for you?

26:36.960 --> 26:38.928
Uh-huh.

26:38.960 --> 26:42.088
It's like the equivalent of
three buckets of popcorn.

26:42.130 --> 26:44.360
But I don't want
three buckets of popcorn.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.368
(door hisses open)

26:46.400 --> 26:48.163
Oh, my God.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.167
What?

26:49.200 --> 26:53.637
(low, indistinct chatter)

26:53.680 --> 26:54.772
Okay, I need your help.

26:54.810 --> 26:55.970
(music playing)

26:56.010 --> 26:57.204
Don't shake
the camera.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.276
Just keep it steady.

26:59.310 --> 27:00.402
What are you doing?

27:00.450 --> 27:02.213
Look at the color.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.911
It's Bollywood.

27:03.950 --> 27:05.349
You can't pass up Bollywood.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.709
Do you know them?

27:06.750 --> 27:08.650
No. It's chance.

27:08.690 --> 27:10.681
I do this
all the time.

27:13.190 --> 27:14.896
Grace, camera up.

27:14.930 --> 27:16.921
*

27:25.740 --> 27:27.731
(quietly):
What are you doing?

27:28.880 --> 27:31.144
* I'm not a rocket scientist

27:31.180 --> 27:33.774
* I rock the house
and SIgn the... *

27:36.850 --> 27:38.408
* Don't take no astrophysicist

27:38.450 --> 27:41.419
* To make your ass throw fits,
now sisters kick it *

27:43.830 --> 27:48.392
* I keep it cool like Eskimo
chicks on Discovery Channel... *

27:49.430 --> 27:51.398
Good to have you back,
Mr. Sartori.

27:51.430 --> 27:52.863
Yeah.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.458
So tell me, what is a power-up?

27:54.500 --> 27:55.899
(chuckles)

27:55.940 --> 27:58.158
Sorry, this is the only place
in the world

27:58.210 --> 27:59.461
where I have to explain
a power-up.

27:59.510 --> 28:02.070
Um, in a video game,

28:02.110 --> 28:05.273
it's something that you collect
to give you extra power.

28:05.310 --> 28:08.416
Like a gun, or,
you know, ammunition.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.941
So, would anyone ever pass up
a power-up?

28:10.990 --> 28:12.844
Huh? No.

28:12.890 --> 28:14.312
Not unless you're crazy.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.987
You never know when you'll
run out of ammunition.

28:16.020 --> 28:16.952
So this suicide vest

28:16.990 --> 28:19.288
_ that_Jimal's avatar
Is wearIng, what Is that?

28:19.330 --> 28:20.797
It's a power-up.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.355
And everybody who plays
your game grabs one?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.219
At one point or another.

28:24.270 --> 28:27.762
In fact, according
to your own logs,

28:27.800 --> 28:29.961
many ASAs in
Mr. Agos's office...

28:30.000 --> 28:32.309
Objection.
Overruled.

28:32.340 --> 28:33.932
...many ASAs in
Mr. Agos's office

28:33.980 --> 28:35.436
have_c_ollected
such SUIClde packs?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.436
Yeah, it's a part
of the game.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.777
It's not a thing.

28:38.810 --> 28:41.313
But doesn't that
mean these ASAs

28:41.350 --> 28:43.215
are more likely to have
murdered Simon Greenberg?

28:43.250 --> 28:45.013
Your Honor.
Psst.

28:47.490 --> 28:50.015
JUDGE:
Mrs. Florrick?

28:50.060 --> 28:53.382
Mrs. Florrick,
any further questions?

28:53.430 --> 28:55.125
Yes, Your Honor.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.355
Mr. Sartori,

28:57.400 --> 29:00.119
Jimal's roommate,
Amir Al-Fulan,

29:00.170 --> 29:02.138
he played
your online game, too?

29:02.170 --> 29:03.398
I have no idea.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.862
This is a record of
your subpoenaed logs.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.434
Can you read that there?

29:06.470 --> 29:07.300
SARTORI:
Oh, yeah.

29:07.340 --> 29:09.376
And you had to reduce
his privileges

29:09.410 --> 29:11.378
because he fought with another
player, didn't he?

29:11.410 --> 29:13.844
Yeah, he, uh,
he got in a fight online.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.438
On the Battle M.E. board.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.244
And who did he fight with?
Can you read that there?

29:18.290 --> 29:21.157
You had to reduced
both their privileges.

29:21.190 --> 29:22.384
Simon Greenberg.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.320
ALICIA:
Thank you.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.390
Jimal's roommate, Amir,
is the most-likely suspect.

29:29.430 --> 29:31.421
But he has an alibi-- praying.

29:31.470 --> 29:32.926
Yes, but he was alone.

29:32.970 --> 29:35.962
What about the other roommate--
TarIq?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.434
We can't find any contact
between Tariq and the victim.

29:38.470 --> 29:40.131
And he doesn't have
the political motive.

29:40.170 --> 29:42.229
Amir is the Palestinian
hard-liner.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.406
Tariq could care less.

29:46.410 --> 29:50.016
Okay. Thank you, Alicia.

29:50.050 --> 29:52.883
Keep us in touch.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.120
What do you think?

29:58.160 --> 30:00.151
I think...

30:00.190 --> 30:02.021
you're holding something
against her.

30:02.060 --> 30:03.391
I'm what?

30:03.430 --> 30:05.398
Alicia.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.863
Maybe it's unconscious,
maybe it's not,

30:06.900 --> 30:08.458
but you're being hard on her.

30:08.500 --> 30:09.831
No.

30:09.870 --> 30:11.406
She's a third-year
associate

30:11.440 --> 30:12.202
on a partner track

30:12.240 --> 30:14.208
and she's treating
us like peers.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.377
That's all
you're seeIng.

30:15.410 --> 30:17.901
My God, am I
the only adult left here?

30:17.950 --> 30:20.407
Could everybody just
put their emotions away?

30:20.450 --> 30:22.008
I've got to get
to a meeting,

30:22.050 --> 30:24.416
unless you have some other
stray observations for me.

30:34.430 --> 30:36.853
Are we overdoing it?

30:42.270 --> 30:45.535
Diane thinks I'm going
too hard on you.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.635
Am I?

30:49.680 --> 30:51.648
Going too hard?

30:51.680 --> 30:53.602
(laughs)

30:55.450 --> 30:57.441
All those late nights...

30:57.480 --> 31:00.449
No time off.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.257
Buried... in work.

31:06.290 --> 31:08.258
(moans softly)

31:08.300 --> 31:10.120
Up to my knees.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.422
(door slams shut)

31:11.470 --> 31:12.596
GIRL:
He's doing it again, Mom!

31:12.630 --> 31:14.564
He's doing it again!

31:14.600 --> 31:16.534
It's just my neighbors.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.538
(arguing continues indistinctly)

31:23.010 --> 31:24.568
Come on,
let's go to the bedroom.

31:24.610 --> 31:27.170
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't move.

31:27.210 --> 31:28.643
Don't move.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.511
(arguing continues indistinctly)

31:47.430 --> 31:48.636
Leg is done,
the chops are ready to go.

31:48.670 --> 31:51.332
I'm just warming up
the leg of lamb piece

31:51.370 --> 31:52.632
after it's been reposing

31:52.670 --> 31:54.979
for ten or 15 minutes...

31:55.010 --> 31:56.568
We need to eat better.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.498
I like what we eat.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.609
No, I need to cook.

32:00.650 --> 32:02.971
(laughing)

32:03.020 --> 32:04.248
(chuckles)

32:05.290 --> 32:08.111
You're happier
without Dad.

32:08.160 --> 32:11.152
No, I'm happier with you.

32:11.190 --> 32:14.125
Okay, that was such
a mom thing to say.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.525
(both laughing)

32:15.560 --> 32:17.653
No, it's about Dad.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.497
Does that upset you?

32:20.530 --> 32:23.294
No.

32:24.340 --> 32:27.104
I don't know.

32:27.140 --> 32:28.505
You know I love Dad.

32:28.540 --> 32:30.701
I know.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.469
I'm sorry.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.441
No.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.641
(man continues speaking
indistinctly on TV)

32:41.620 --> 32:43.508
I found you
a new tutor.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.118
Dana.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.685
I think you'll like her,
she's social.

32:47.730 --> 32:50.119
Actually, I think I
like this one now.

32:50.160 --> 32:54.529
You... I thought you said
she was too different.

32:54.570 --> 32:56.561
She is.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.534
But sometimes different
Isn't always bad.

32:58.570 --> 33:01.403
She's coming over to help me
set up my computer tomorrow.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.600
What?

33:03.640 --> 33:06.245
Mm, she's setting up
your computer?

33:06.280 --> 33:08.271
I asked her to.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.673
Please tell me _
you're learnIng somethIng,

33:09.720 --> 33:11.449
and that this isn't
all pointless.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.708
I'm learning something.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.059
So how do you
explain that, Amir?

33:16.090 --> 33:18.229
I don't explain it.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.353
You said you didn't know
the victim, Simon Greenberg,

33:20.390 --> 33:22.255
and here you are
on a video game

33:22.300 --> 33:24.188
fighting with him.

33:24.230 --> 33:26.221
I don't need to talk to you.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.534
You got no authority here.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.739
Hey, you want to make yourself
useful in here?

33:37.310 --> 33:39.403
(door creaking)

33:40.510 --> 33:42.375
I just got
the authority.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.479
KALINDA:
He claims

33:44.520 --> 33:45.748
it wasn't him.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.417
It wasn't him, what,
fighting against Greenberg?

33:47.450 --> 33:48.781
On the video game.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.253
Amir says it was Tariq.

33:50.290 --> 33:51.757
He let him use
hIs screen name.

33:51.790 --> 33:53.758
These roommates--
they share everything.

33:53.790 --> 33:57.658
So I'm checking Tariq,
but we're back to square one.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.760
Ami_r_had a motive--
po|ItIcs, fanatICIsm.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.530
Tariq isn't political
or religious.

34:04.670 --> 34:06.729
I wonder
if we're making a mistake

34:06.770 --> 34:08.772
thinking it's about
Middle Eastern politics.

34:08.810 --> 34:11.074
These kids--
they're just... college kids.

34:11.110 --> 34:12.372
WOMAN:
All rise.

34:12.410 --> 34:15.345
Okay, I'll keep checking,
but I'll need some time.

34:15.380 --> 34:16.779
WOMAN:
Judge Karpman presiding.

34:16.820 --> 34:18.583
Thank you.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.383
Please be seated.

34:23.460 --> 34:26.827
JUDGE:
So, this is
where we stand.

34:26.860 --> 34:30.648
There is sufficient evidence
for a finding of probable cause.

34:30.700 --> 34:33.419
Further, we set this
case on my trial...

34:33.470 --> 34:35.688
Your Honor, we ask
that you recuse yourself.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.332
Excuse me?

34:37.370 --> 34:38.701
ALICIA:
We believe

34:38.740 --> 34:41.277
you have shown bias
against our client.

34:41.310 --> 34:44.404
Believe? Really?

34:44.450 --> 34:46.270
In what way?

34:46.310 --> 34:48.847
Your religion.

34:52.550 --> 34:54.518
This is...

34:54.560 --> 34:56.551
outrageous.

34:56.590 --> 34:58.854
I'm...

34:58.890 --> 35:01.529
My Jewish background

35:01.560 --> 35:04.324
is completely irrelevant
mmsmm.

35:04.370 --> 35:08.363
Your Honor, you have given money
to the Outlook for Israel,

35:08.400 --> 35:10.265
an organization

35:10.300 --> 35:11.801
that supports
the settlements in Israel.

35:11.840 --> 35:12.909
We believe

35:12.940 --> 35:15.431
you have shown bias
against our client, and we ask

35:15.480 --> 35:17.698
that a new judge hear
further proceedings.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.844
I'll give you my answer
in an hour.

35:19.880 --> 35:20.676
(bangs gavel)

35:20.710 --> 35:22.849
He's not going to
recuse himself.

35:22.880 --> 35:23.778
He will.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.788
Karpman always backs down
when he's pushed.

35:25.820 --> 35:27.685
He's afraid he'll be
overturned on appeal.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.688
So we start_ over
WIth a new judge.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.723
No. I know what
Alicia's doing.

35:42.570 --> 35:44.731
Oh. Hi, Michael.
How are you?

35:44.770 --> 35:48.308
I was just sitting here
going over this campaign.

35:48.340 --> 35:49.876
Arab Spring.

35:49.910 --> 35:52.549
Sort of like Irish Spring,

35:52.580 --> 35:54.741
but with Arabs.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.475
Do you want
some coffee?
How much?

35:56.520 --> 35:57.873
For the coffee?

35:57.920 --> 35:58.739
How much for six months

35:58.790 --> 36:00.644
ifI brought
the Jewish League Fund here?

36:00.690 --> 36:03.488
How much are you paying
Tarkovslq & Associates?

36:03.520 --> 36:04.748
You know how much I'm paying.

36:04.790 --> 36:06.655
Well, of course,
we would have to tell

36:06.690 --> 36:08.794
Mr. Al-_Said that we can't handle
hIs account anymore,

36:08.830 --> 36:10.650
so if you'd help us
defer those costs...

36:10.700 --> 36:13.897
You're really a son of a bitch.

36:13.930 --> 36:15.864
Iam.

36:15.900 --> 36:17.788
But now
I'm your son of a bitch.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.239
WOMAN:
All rise.

36:19.270 --> 36:20.760
Judge Karpman
presiding.

36:20.810 --> 36:23.176
Please be seated.

36:25.010 --> 36:28.810
I've taken a great deal of time
with this motion because

36:28.850 --> 36:30.943
I believe that part
of being a tough judge

36:30.980 --> 36:32.811
is also being
a fair judge.

36:32.850 --> 36:34.818
Your Honor,
may I quickly interrupt?

36:34.860 --> 36:36.816
Can't imagine why, Counselor.
I'm ready to rule.

36:36.860 --> 36:38.487
Yes, but... I believe

36:38.530 --> 36:40.919
Mrs. Florrick is attempting
to manipulate this court.

36:40.960 --> 36:41.756
Excuse me!

36:41.800 --> 36:42.892
If you recuse yourself,
Your Honor,

36:42.930 --> 36:45.626
the court will be forced
to choose a new judge tomorrow?

36:45.670 --> 36:46.625
Is that correct?

36:46.670 --> 36:47.625
Yes, it is.

36:47.670 --> 36:48.967
You were about
to make your ru|Ing, Your Honor?

36:49.000 --> 36:49.932
That's what she's counting on.

36:49.970 --> 36:51.835
Do you know what tomorrow is,
Your Honor?

36:51.870 --> 36:53.963
What tomorrow is?
The holiday.

36:54.010 --> 36:55.978
That has nothing to do
with my motion.

36:56.010 --> 36:57.329
It's Rosh Hashanah.

36:57.380 --> 37:00.269
There will be no
Jewish judges in court,

37:00.310 --> 37:02.915
the case will be assigned
to a non-Jewish judge.

37:02.950 --> 37:04.588
That is why
she's asking you

37:04.620 --> 37:06.679
to recuse yourself.
Your Honor,
this is offensive!

37:06.720 --> 37:08.017
Mrs. Florrick,

37:08.050 --> 37:10.359
Iam...

37:10.390 --> 37:12.984
disappointed in you.

37:15.330 --> 37:17.298
The motion is denied.

37:17.330 --> 37:19.969
Case remains on my trial call!

37:36.880 --> 37:39.280
(dance music playing,
crowd chatter)

37:39.320 --> 37:41.288
Hi, Tariq.
How are you?

37:41.320 --> 37:42.958
So, what,
are you following me?

37:42.990 --> 37:44.787
No.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.388
I'm following her.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.522
Hey, Tariq.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.290
You know, if you're looking
for a more discreet gay bar,

37:50.330 --> 37:52.423
I'd try Scarlet's
on Halsted.
No, no, no, no.

37:52.470 --> 37:53.994
I'd trySidetrack.

37:54.030 --> 37:55.964
It's too leathery.
What do you need?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.503
You used Amir's avatar on Battle
M.E.,the online video game.

37:58.540 --> 37:59.962
So?

38:00.010 --> 38:02.535
So, that's where you
met Simon Greenberg.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.502
No.
Yeah.

38:04.550 --> 38:08.611
Actually... yeah.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.618
Checked your alibi.

38:10.650 --> 38:11.981
Didn't hold up, Tariq.

38:12.020 --> 38:13.578
You weren't
at the interfaith rally.

38:13.620 --> 38:14.882
Why would I kill Greenberg?

38:14.920 --> 38:16.012
It-It makes no sense.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.085
We spoke to
the bartender.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.759
He said you met Greenberg
here quite a few times.

38:20.790 --> 38:23.588
My guess is,
you two fell in love.

38:23.630 --> 38:25.495
You argued. He
met someone else.

38:25.530 --> 38:26.827
You got jealous.

38:26.870 --> 38:27.894
You stabbed him.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.693
Made it look like
a hate crime.

38:31.710 --> 38:32.836
(loud crowd chatter)

38:32.870 --> 38:35.430
(grunting)

38:35.480 --> 38:37.903
(gasping)

38:40.380 --> 38:41.870
Why the reversed
swastika?

38:41.920 --> 38:43.046
What?
When you set it up

38:43.080 --> 38:45.617
as a hate crime, why did you
draw the swastika backward?

38:45.650 --> 38:47.811
What do you mean?
Isn't that how you draw it?

38:47.850 --> 38:50.114
Hmm.

38:50.160 --> 38:52.048
Is it good
for the Jewish League Fund?

38:52.090 --> 38:53.455
I don't know.

38:53.490 --> 38:55.993
The Muslim was the killer,
but he was also gay,

38:56.030 --> 38:58.123
and sleeping with our guy,
so, uh,

38:58.160 --> 39:02.961
I would call that
a CIaSSIC meed message.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.968
(whispers):
Crisis management.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.934
If it helps our cause,
I could find out if he's a top.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.107
(laughs)

39:09.140 --> 39:11.335
That was a joke.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.869
Yeah. Okay, I-I-I got to go.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.876
Important work?

39:16.920 --> 39:19.639
Fate of the world.
What do you think?

39:19.690 --> 39:22.011
It's very flattering, Eli.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.086
But I can't be thinking
about the governorship

39:25.130 --> 39:27.086
when I'm doing this job.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.121
So do this job.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.095
Let me think about
the governorship.

39:34.870 --> 39:36.861
Just an observation from work.

39:38.540 --> 39:40.861
If you're worried
about Alicia and Will Gardner...

39:40.910 --> 39:44.038
I'm not... worried.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.139
I know, I know, but, um,

39:46.180 --> 39:48.478
if you were,

39:48.520 --> 39:51.842
I think that whatever was there
Is no more.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.744
They barely look
at each other.

39:53.790 --> 39:55.781
Eli.

39:57.490 --> 40:00.425
You don't want
a divorced candidate, do you?

40:00.460 --> 40:01.927
No, I...

40:03.100 --> 40:06.160
Forget it.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.794
(laughs)

40:08.840 --> 40:11.638
(blues playing)

40:11.670 --> 40:13.638
* Yes, good-bye

40:13.670 --> 40:15.171
You need a friend, K.

40:15.210 --> 40:16.768
* I mean good-bye...

40:16.810 --> 40:19.005
Why do I need a friend?

40:19.050 --> 40:20.699
Or a dog.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.217
Maybe you need a dog.

40:25.050 --> 40:26.915
Out investigating.

40:26.950 --> 40:28.918
(laughs)

40:28.960 --> 40:31.929
I'm fine, Will. Really.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.451
WOMAN:
What's wrong with me?

40:34.500 --> 40:36.024
(crying)

40:36.060 --> 40:40.167
We're not like normal
people, are we?

40:40.200 --> 40:42.191
What are normal people like?

40:45.110 --> 40:47.066
Emotional.

40:47.110 --> 40:48.668
You're emotional.
No.

40:48.710 --> 40:50.837
Sometimes I'm in the
middle of an emotion,

40:50.880 --> 40:55.146
and I just look at
myself and realize...

40:55.180 --> 40:57.148
I'm not feeling anything.

40:57.180 --> 41:01.549
Ijust like acting like
someone who feels something.

41:01.590 --> 41:04.650
You want to stop acting
and actually feel?

41:04.690 --> 41:06.851
Yeah.

41:06.890 --> 41:08.084
Yeah.

41:08.130 --> 41:10.121
(blow strikes Will)

41:13.200 --> 41:14.838
Ow.

41:14.870 --> 41:16.235
That's what
it feels like.

41:16.270 --> 41:17.794
Thanks.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.102
(laughs)

41:19.140 --> 41:21.233
I got to go.

41:21.270 --> 41:23.875
I got to be
somewhere at 8:45.

41:23.910 --> 41:25.946
Really?

41:25.980 --> 41:27.777
That's specific.

41:27.810 --> 41:29.812
Yup.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.742
Be good.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.916
PETER:
I'll get them

41:36.960 --> 41:38.518
to school
on Monday.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.528
You sure?
Yeah.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.592
(heavy sigh)

41:43.630 --> 41:45.120
ZACH:
Do we take
our homework?

41:45.170 --> 41:46.569
Yes!
PETER:
Yes!

41:46.600 --> 41:49.763
So, you've hired a tutor
for Grace?

41:49.800 --> 41:51.062
Yes, I did.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.136
She's good, I think,
and Grace likes her.

41:53.170 --> 41:55.172
Or... she likes her now.

41:55.210 --> 41:57.929
I'll keep an eye on that.

41:57.980 --> 41:59.800
Oh, um, also,

41:59.850 --> 42:01.078
Zach's girlfriend, Nisa--

42:01.110 --> 42:03.146
her parents wanted us
to come for dinner.

42:03.180 --> 42:05.717
I'll tell her
you're busy.

42:05.750 --> 42:07.684
Yeah, yeah, tell her I'm...
I'm busy.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.551
ZACH :
Love you.

42:09.590 --> 42:11.012
Love you.

42:11.060 --> 42:12.152
Love you.
I love you.

42:12.190 --> 42:13.782
You call if you need anything.

42:13.830 --> 42:15.821
I'll be here.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.538
(clock ticking)

42:51.360 --> 42:53.760
(clock ticking)

43:02.340 --> 43:04.205
(knocking on door)
