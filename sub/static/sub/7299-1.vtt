Test and reset.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.180
By the way, congratulations.

00:39.214 --> 00:40.511
Have you thought of
a name for your kid?

00:40.549 --> 00:41.948
Well, we're still fighting.

00:41.984 --> 00:44.384
I'm holding out for
Joe DiMaggio Mazilli.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.388
The greatest Yankee

00:52.594 --> 00:53.720
In.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.320
Heads up, guys.
Here comes Colonel Braddock.

00:55.364 --> 00:57.662
So, why would the colonel
want to go to Cambodia?

00:57.699 --> 01:00.190
Yeah, he could get hurt
going across the fence.

01:00.235 --> 01:02.703
He's leading a recon unit,
checking enemy strength.

01:02.738 --> 01:03.864
Clear?

01:03.906 --> 01:05.032
Clear left, sir.

01:05.074 --> 01:06.234

01:16.051 --> 01:17.245
Good morning, sir.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.913
Good morning, Sergeant.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.013
Sorry I'm late.

01:21.056 --> 01:22.580
Would you like to take
the controls, sir?

01:22.624 --> 01:24.956
No, thanks, Captain.
I'm just along for the ride.

01:50.786 --> 01:53.050
What are the coordinates
on LZ Sally?

01:53.088 --> 01:56.251
Three-seven-four-zero-
three-zero-one-niner.

01:58.727 --> 02:01.719
We're right on top of them.
Let's give them a holler.

02:01.763 --> 02:04.323
Alligator four,
this is Red Gap six.

02:04.366 --> 02:08.029
Alligator four, we're
taking fire from all quadrants.

02:08.070 --> 02:11.506
Sir, they're in a fire fight
down there.

02:11.540 --> 02:14.941
Charlie's got them pinned down
two miles south of the LZ.

02:14.977 --> 02:16.103
How bad is it?

02:16.145 --> 02:18.739
They're taking fire
from all quadrants, sir.

02:18.780 --> 02:21.214
Do you want to go in?

02:21.250 --> 02:23.480
Hang on, guys.
We're coming down to get you.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.578
Get ready to move.
Take it down, Captain.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.163
Captain, let's move out now!

02:43.205 --> 02:44.502
Keep your shirt on, son.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.263
All right! Go!

03:23.378 --> 03:24.367
Come on!

03:30.652 --> 03:31.983
Come on, son.
We got to get out of here.

03:52.207 --> 03:54.368
Shit! Damn!

03:57.412 --> 03:58.538
You OK?

03:58.580 --> 04:00.047
I'm fine.
Let's go to the chopper!

04:00.082 --> 04:01.242
Come on!

04:19.034 --> 04:21.002
Sir, they're getting
a good bead on us!

04:21.036 --> 04:22.024
Colonel!

04:23.605 --> 04:25.197
Looks like some
more party crashers, sir!

04:28.377 --> 04:29.810
All right, come on!
Get in there!

04:29.845 --> 04:31.506
Come on. Get in there. Quick!

04:33.849 --> 04:35.009
Sir!

04:35.050 --> 04:36.210
Let's get the hell out of here!

04:52.668 --> 04:54.101
What the hell is that?

04:54.136 --> 04:56.536
We're hit! We're going down!

04:56.571 --> 04:58.801
I'm gonna try to make the lake.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.829
Get ready to jump.

05:02.744 --> 05:03.836
Jump!

05:37.045 --> 05:38.478
Jump, Lieutenant!

05:38.513 --> 05:40.105
I said, jump, Lieutenant!

06:20.989 --> 06:23.753
On the day America
remembers its war dead...

06:23.792 --> 06:28.024
a special salute today
to the war dead of Vietnam.

06:28.063 --> 06:31.521
An American serviceman who died
there took his place today...

06:31.566 --> 06:35.332
in a place of honor,
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

06:35.370 --> 06:39.033
Almost 10 years after the last
Americans left Saigon...

06:39.074 --> 06:42.805
the men who fought in Vietnam
got their parade.

06:42.844 --> 06:45.039
Muffled drums and dirges...

06:45.080 --> 06:47.640
a coffin and a flag
wrapped in plastic...

06:47.682 --> 06:49.650
to protect it from the rain.

06:49.684 --> 06:52.152
In the amphitheater
of Arlington Cemetery...

06:52.187 --> 06:54.712
families of the men
still missing from Vietnam...

06:54.756 --> 06:58.749
waited for the coffin
and remembered.

06:58.794 --> 07:01.729
They wonder if their sons
are still alive...

07:01.763 --> 07:03.458
and why the world sits back...

07:03.498 --> 07:05.056
and allows
the Vietnamese government...

07:05.100 --> 07:08.866
to flagrantly violate
the Geneva Convention.

07:08.904 --> 07:11.338
Rumors of physical
and mental torture...

07:11.373 --> 07:13.807
have made
the wait more agonizing.

07:13.842 --> 07:18.006
The families were reassured
by a deeply moved president.

07:18.046 --> 07:21.243
We write no last chapters...

07:21.283 --> 07:23.444
we close no books...

07:23.485 --> 07:25.953
we put away no final memories.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.649
An end to America's
involvement in Vietnam...

07:28.690 --> 07:31.158
cannot come
before we have achieved...

07:31.193 --> 07:35.527
the fullest possible accounting
of those missing in action.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.149
Colonel Yin...

08:07.662 --> 08:11.291
you may not give a damn
about the Geneva Convention...

08:11.333 --> 08:14.962
but someday you're gonna
be held accountable.

08:15.003 --> 08:19.940
The Geneva Convention applies
to prisoners of war.

08:19.975 --> 08:23.411
You men are not
prisoners of war.

08:23.445 --> 08:25.743
You are common criminals.

08:25.780 --> 08:27.372
I have repeatedly told you...

08:27.415 --> 08:30.043
that there is no escape
from my camp...

08:30.085 --> 08:34.749
unless you consider
death an escape.

08:34.789 --> 08:37.121
You are surrounded by cliffs...

08:37.158 --> 08:40.025
mountains,
jungles full of man traps...

08:40.061 --> 08:43.553
and a bridge that is impassable.

08:43.597 --> 08:48.695
None of you have ever escaped,
and none of you will.

08:48.737 --> 08:52.696
The only way for you to leave
my camp...

08:52.741 --> 08:56.370
is if Braddock confesses.

08:58.079 --> 09:02.140
He defends the country
that has forgotten you...

09:02.183 --> 09:07.382
an outlaw nation
the rest of the world reviles!

09:13.228 --> 09:18.291
They are killing
your ambassadors of the evil...

09:18.333 --> 09:20.096
in every part of the world.

09:41.423 --> 09:42.617
I have something for you.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.560
Hey, it's a beaut.

09:50.599 --> 09:51.861
It's a good two inches.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.458
Angelo says thanks.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.803
What he give you?

10:02.844 --> 10:04.937
A B-52.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.743
It's just a worm
for his chicken.

10:16.024 --> 10:18.322
You know, I got to learn
to keep my mouth shut.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.419
What do you do?
You never shoot your mouth off.

10:20.462 --> 10:22.362
I try to decide
if what I'm going to say...

10:22.397 --> 10:23.557
is worth getting hit for.

10:26.101 --> 10:27.261
Wish I could do that.

10:27.302 --> 10:28.428
Franklin?

10:28.470 --> 10:29.767
Hey, it's hot. I'm sweating.

10:31.773 --> 10:33.104
Looks like the malaria again.

10:33.141 --> 10:34.130
Hey...

10:42.651 --> 10:44.744
What the hell is Harry doing?

10:44.786 --> 10:47.914
I'll bite his head off
for a pack of cigarettes.

12:00.662 --> 12:02.129
Colonel Braddock,
I need to talk to you.

12:04.999 --> 12:05.988
Colonel.

12:11.740 --> 12:15.403
Look, I'm real sorry
those two guys died...

12:15.443 --> 12:18.276
but we don't all have to.

12:18.313 --> 12:20.338
Maybe I can get Yin
not to ride you so hard.

12:20.381 --> 12:21.575
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, Braddock?

12:28.022 --> 12:29.353
How about it, Sarge?

12:29.390 --> 12:32.052
I mean, you know you could use
some time off.

12:32.093 --> 12:33.958
Begging the captain's
pardon, sir...

12:35.296 --> 12:39.562
but kiss my black ass.

12:39.601 --> 12:40.590
That's funny.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.528
All you guys are
big, brave soldiers...

12:43.571 --> 12:44.697
and you think I'm a coward.

12:44.739 --> 12:47.606
No, you're not a coward.
You're a traitor.

12:49.544 --> 12:50.704
I'm not a traitor.

12:52.447 --> 12:54.506
Look, our country
has forgotten about us...

12:54.549 --> 12:57.040
and we have to do
anything we can to survive.

12:57.085 --> 12:58.780
Look, I'm not the bad guy here.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.448
It's Braddock
and his stupid pride.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.683
When we first got here...

13:02.724 --> 13:05.591
there were five times
as many of us... 33 Americans.

13:05.627 --> 13:06.616
Now look at us.

13:07.962 --> 13:09.759
I say that all Braddock
has to do is confess...

13:09.798 --> 13:12.824
to some garbage war crime,
and Yin will send us home.

13:12.867 --> 13:13.993
Who's gonna care?

13:15.336 --> 13:17.031
The war has been over for...

13:20.241 --> 13:21.640
for God knows how long.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.041
We don't know that for sure.

13:23.077 --> 13:25.637
There is no war.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.978
And nobody gives
a damn about us.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.177
Oh, yeah?

13:30.218 --> 13:32.083
Well, I hear they're
coming to get us.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.645
And if I were you,
I'd rather die here...

13:34.689 --> 13:36.054
than have to explain
to my kid...

13:36.090 --> 13:37.751
that I was a gutless traitor.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.157
At least I've seen my kid.

13:42.764 --> 13:43.753
Let him go.

13:49.270 --> 13:50.703
Back off, Nester.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.479
Die if you want to, all of you.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.523
Who tell you someone coming?

14:09.557 --> 14:11.184
No one.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.057
I made it up to piss him off.

14:16.798 --> 14:18.823
Why'd those guys have to run?

14:18.867 --> 14:20.334
God, I got to get some sleep!

14:23.404 --> 14:25.929
But whenever I close my eyes,
I see my wife Gina.

14:30.645 --> 14:32.909
Yeah. My Diane's
gonna be mad at me.

14:35.116 --> 14:37.084
I wanted the four kids
more than she did.

14:38.887 --> 14:40.115
We made a deal.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.748
She'd work, and I'd retire
and bring them up.

14:48.229 --> 14:50.993
I fooled the hell out of her.

14:51.032 --> 14:52.897
I haven't even seen my kid!

15:00.108 --> 15:01.905
I'm sorry.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.877
I try to block it out,
but I can't.

15:03.912 --> 15:06.642
No one can.

15:06.681 --> 15:08.148
You do. Nothing bothers you.

15:09.717 --> 15:10.877
I'm just...

15:13.321 --> 15:15.152
I'm just not tough like you.

16:25.426 --> 16:26.415
Lao.

16:34.002 --> 16:36.800
Sergeant Lawrence Opelka...

16:36.838 --> 16:38.999
you have been tried
and found guilty...

16:39.040 --> 16:42.567
of war crimes against
the people of Vietnam...

16:42.610 --> 16:44.805
and have been sentenced
to death.

17:30.224 --> 17:31.384
Please!

17:37.665 --> 17:38.654
Nester.

17:41.536 --> 17:42.833
What does he want from him?

17:53.948 --> 17:55.210
Chou, get over here!

17:55.249 --> 17:57.308
Chou! You scum!

17:57.351 --> 17:59.342
Come down here, Chou!

17:59.387 --> 18:00.513
Mazilli!

18:00.555 --> 18:03.649
Come here, Chou!
You're nothing! Chou! Chou!

18:03.691 --> 18:06.387
You lose.

18:06.427 --> 18:07.689
You're scum, Chou!

18:07.728 --> 18:09.320
Get down here
and shut that door!

18:09.363 --> 18:10.489
Mazilli!

18:10.531 --> 18:12.692
Get down here, Chou!
I said, get down here!

18:12.733 --> 18:13.722
Mazilli!

18:16.037 --> 18:18.005
It's not doing anyone any good.
You know that.

18:18.039 --> 18:20.507
What the hell is going on?

18:20.541 --> 18:22.236
Why are they starting
this torture crap again?

18:34.222 --> 18:36.452
It's OK, kid. It's OK.

18:55.943 --> 18:57.877
Here. Brought you some things.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.378
Did you get the quinine?

19:01.415 --> 19:03.610
No, I can't.
Yin has it locked up.

19:03.651 --> 19:06.984
But he told me to tell you
that if Braddock confesses...

19:07.021 --> 19:08.249
he will give it to you.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.188
Yin can't be trusted.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.626
I've given him what he wanted,
and he's treated me well enough.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.825
He doesn't care about you.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.234
It's Braddock's confession
he's always wanted.

19:23.271 --> 19:26.240
Over the years,
it's driven him mad.

19:26.274 --> 19:28.834
Then why not
just give it to him?

19:30.244 --> 19:35.045
If Yin ever breaks Braddock,
we will all be killed.

19:37.385 --> 19:41.253
Colonel Braddock,
I have spoken to my superiors...

19:41.289 --> 19:43.086
and arranged for you
to be released...

19:44.859 --> 19:49.796
if you will simply let us film
your confession just once.

19:49.830 --> 19:53.288
No public appearances,
no questions.

19:53.334 --> 19:55.029
We could do it right now.

20:01.042 --> 20:02.339
You know I can't do that.

20:06.514 --> 20:11.042
Some of my men feel
I am being too lenient with you.

20:18.059 --> 20:19.151
Colonel Braddock...

20:20.494 --> 20:22.587
I didn't want
to have to tell you this...

20:22.630 --> 20:25.190
but maybe you should know.

20:25.233 --> 20:29.033
Your wife
is planning to remarry.

20:30.538 --> 20:32.904
She has you declared dead.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.540
Your family needs you.

20:41.882 --> 20:43.509
Sign this statement...

20:43.551 --> 20:47.487
I will let you go home
before the wedding.

20:50.224 --> 20:54.092
Colonel Yin, if my wife
is getting remarried...

20:54.128 --> 20:55.720
I'm happy for her...

20:55.763 --> 20:57.924
because if she's gonna wait for
me to sign this confession...

20:57.965 --> 21:00.024
she's gonna be waiting
a long time.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.808
Get him out of here.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.322
Get down! Come on!

21:35.670 --> 21:37.865
Hey! Come on!

21:37.905 --> 21:40.840
That humper Lao is the biggest
asshole this side of Nester.

21:45.046 --> 21:47.276
Leave him alone, Lao.
You hear me?!

21:51.786 --> 21:55.916
Braddock, since you're
in a fighting mood...

21:55.956 --> 21:57.116
I'll give you one.

21:59.193 --> 22:02.094
Nester, you will be
Braddock's opponent...

22:02.129 --> 22:03.528
and you will win.

22:08.736 --> 22:09.964
I can't do that, sir.

22:12.206 --> 22:15.539
Colonel Yin, our deal was that
I would never have to hurt...

22:15.576 --> 22:16.975
any of the other prisoners.

22:18.512 --> 22:20.207
Fine.

22:20.247 --> 22:22.374
Don't fight.

22:22.416 --> 22:23.508
But...

22:25.986 --> 22:29.786
I will put you back
in the Americans' cell.

22:29.824 --> 22:34.318
I'm not sure you would be as
popular there as you once were.

22:57.718 --> 23:00.414
Why don't you just take a few
punches and go down, Colonel?

23:00.454 --> 23:02.183
It’ll save us both
a lot of pain.

23:02.223 --> 23:03.212
Yeah.

23:05.626 --> 23:06.957
Put your hands up, Braddock.

23:09.063 --> 23:10.792
Colonel Yin is watching us.

23:10.831 --> 23:11.991
Put your hands up.

23:12.032 --> 23:13.932
Nester, he's using you.

23:16.404 --> 23:17.564
Come on.

23:21.041 --> 23:23.305
Come on, sir! Get up!

23:23.344 --> 23:26.745
Protect yourself!

23:26.781 --> 23:28.373
Damn you, Colonel. Fight me.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.949
Come on, Colonel.
Protect yourself.

23:33.387 --> 23:34.376
Braddock.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.082
Nester, Nester.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.489
Get up, Colonel! Get up!

23:38.526 --> 23:39.823
Come on.

23:39.860 --> 23:40.986
Braddock!

23:41.028 --> 23:44.589
You bastard,
either stay down or fight!

23:44.632 --> 23:47.260
Come on, Colonel!
Hit him again! Yes!

23:50.204 --> 23:52.434
He's gonna kill you, Nester.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.997
I don't want to fight you,
Nester.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.975
You got no choice now, Colonel.

23:57.411 --> 23:59.709
No more favors.

23:59.747 --> 24:02.272
Now I'm gonna hurt you!

24:02.316 --> 24:04.216
Come on, sir! Get up!

24:04.251 --> 24:05.548
Come on! For all of us!
Get him!

24:05.586 --> 24:06.883
Come on, Colonel!

24:06.921 --> 24:10.084
Come on, Nester,
don't be a fool, man!

24:16.664 --> 24:18.063
Get up, Colonel.
Come on, get up.

24:20.634 --> 24:22.693
Finish him off.

24:22.736 --> 24:23.998
Come on!

24:25.306 --> 24:26.432
Come on.

24:26.474 --> 24:28.465
One more. Come on, in on him!

24:28.509 --> 24:30.443
Give him another one.
Finish him off. Come on.

24:31.946 --> 24:33.072
Yes! Come on, colonel!

24:33.113 --> 24:35.081
Come on, Braddock.

24:35.115 --> 24:37.310
Enough. Come on.
Finish this off.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.340
Give him one good shot.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.183
Come on!

24:54.134 --> 24:55.829
Finish him off, sir. Come on.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.098
- Be careful.
- Watch yourself.

24:57.137 --> 24:58.297
Finish him off!

25:01.675 --> 25:02.937
Come on. Get up!

25:02.977 --> 25:04.911
Get up, Colonel.

25:04.945 --> 25:07.004
Come on, Braddock.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.173
Get up, Braddock.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.376
Get up, Colonel. Get up.

25:10.417 --> 25:11.577
One shot!

25:11.619 --> 25:14.782
Come on, get up. Come on.
Come on, Colonel, get up!

25:14.822 --> 25:17.313
Now! You're beaten!

25:17.358 --> 25:19.189
Come on, soldier, get up.

25:25.566 --> 25:26.794
How's it feel, Nester?!

25:30.938 --> 25:33.099
Keep on him!
Get him, Colonel!

25:33.140 --> 25:34.164
Yes!

25:36.644 --> 25:38.168
Sir, Colonel,
you're killing him!

26:08.609 --> 26:10.338
That's enough!

26:10.377 --> 26:12.072
Lao, that's enough!

26:12.112 --> 26:13.204
No!

26:23.357 --> 26:24.619
You see what happens...

26:24.658 --> 26:28.754
when one does not follow
my direction immediately.

26:35.703 --> 26:37.728
You lose.

26:44.645 --> 26:45.634
Colonel?

26:49.216 --> 26:50.683
What did Yin lay on you
this time?

26:50.718 --> 26:53.346
He said that my wife's
getting remarried...

26:53.387 --> 26:54.854
and I've been declared dead.

26:54.888 --> 26:57.686
He's bullshitting you.
You know that, don't you?

27:01.929 --> 27:03.089
Captain Ho.

27:05.532 --> 27:06.658
Anything on the quinine?

27:06.700 --> 27:08.395
I don't have malaria.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.902
Nothing.

27:13.941 --> 27:15.374
But I have some things for you.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.036
Beer?

27:32.259 --> 27:34.090
Why don't you go give
the guys a drink?

27:34.128 --> 27:35.186
Sure.

27:41.001 --> 27:42.901
Have I got a surprise for you.

27:45.105 --> 27:47.539
You see this baby, huh?
Look at that.

27:47.574 --> 27:50.600
Hey, Lieutenant, have a sip.

27:52.446 --> 27:54.107
This is what you wanted.

27:58.819 --> 27:59.808
Thanks, Captain.

28:42.162 --> 28:44.722
Colonel Yin,
I need to talk to you.

28:48.736 --> 28:51.136
I'm the officer in charge.

28:51.171 --> 28:53.605
If you have to punish somebody,
then punish me.

29:04.685 --> 29:07.745
Confess. Admit your mistake.

29:10.390 --> 29:11.379
No.

29:17.664 --> 29:18.824
Very well.

29:21.535 --> 29:22.695
Dou Chou.

29:28.408 --> 29:29.568
No!

29:36.650 --> 29:40.780
You're right.
You are responsible.

29:48.061 --> 29:50.120
Come on, Franklin.
Here. I'll help you.

31:51.718 --> 31:54.312
Let me get that one.
You get the small ones.

31:54.354 --> 31:56.447
Fine. I ain't doing
so hot anyway.

32:06.099 --> 32:07.088
What's that?

32:08.435 --> 32:10.096
It's a chopper...

32:10.137 --> 32:11.263
A Huey.

32:11.305 --> 32:12.237
It sounds American.

32:31.625 --> 32:34.185
Stop him!

33:35.055 --> 33:36.283
What the hell?

33:48.702 --> 33:51.830
I hope I didn't scare you guys.

33:51.872 --> 33:53.635
How do you like
my new helicopter?

33:55.042 --> 33:56.441
You are a day early.

33:56.476 --> 34:00.037
I had to borrow it.
The other was too small.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.674
I've brought you an arsenal
that will discourage anyone...

34:02.716 --> 34:04.707
from cutting into
our opium business.

34:04.751 --> 34:09.552
Now all that can harm us are
your American friends.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.386
Why are they still alive?

34:11.425 --> 34:15.225
Francois, I have
the situation under control.

34:17.998 --> 34:19.829
Thanks for our treat.

34:19.866 --> 34:22.426
You're a hot little devil.

34:22.469 --> 34:25.495
You know, this time
they're all virgins.

34:27.774 --> 34:28.934
Come on, girls.

34:32.279 --> 34:35.077
Colonel, I don't think
there is a search team.

34:36.850 --> 34:38.976
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

34:39.018 --> 34:41.543
At least we know what they're
putting in that hut.

34:41.588 --> 34:42.815
Those boxes?

34:42.856 --> 34:45.085
They're full of weapons.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.888
That's our way out.

34:48.228 --> 34:50.492
When do you aim to kill
the Americans?

34:50.530 --> 34:52.293
In my own time.

34:52.331 --> 34:54.458
You're risking
our entire operation...

34:54.501 --> 34:55.991
a very profitable operation.

34:56.036 --> 34:58.129
I'm thinking of
getting a new watch.

34:58.171 --> 35:01.038
Do you think you can purchase
one of those digital models?

35:02.876 --> 35:05.868
I told you to kill
the Americans, goddamn it!

35:05.912 --> 35:08.847
If the P.O.W. Search team hears
about it, we're finished!

35:08.882 --> 35:10.975
Don't let your stupid ego
ruin everything!

35:18.291 --> 35:21.124
Francois, will you
come with me for a moment?

35:26.666 --> 35:28.395
Look, I didn't want to...

35:30.003 --> 35:34.599
You will never again speak to me
like that in front of my men.

35:34.641 --> 35:36.438
It sets a dangerous example.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.335
Do you understand me?

35:43.016 --> 35:44.278
Good.

35:46.853 --> 35:53.122
Do you have any new information
about the American search team?

35:53.160 --> 35:56.095
No. It's still rumors...

35:56.129 --> 35:59.997
but there's been a guy
hanging around asking questions.

36:04.304 --> 36:05.669
I wonder if Opelka is dead.

36:05.705 --> 36:08.731
No. If he were...

36:08.775 --> 36:11.437
Colonel Yin would stick his body
right in front of our faces.

36:15.448 --> 36:18.542
So, my friend,
could I convince you...

36:18.585 --> 36:21.145
to spend the night
with us and the virgins?

36:22.489 --> 36:24.457
Sorry. I better not.

36:24.491 --> 36:25.617
Understand...

36:25.659 --> 36:27.456
I'm delivering
the opium personally...

36:27.494 --> 36:29.724
but I will be back
to pick up the girls.

36:33.867 --> 36:35.164
Don't forget my watch.

37:04.197 --> 37:09.134
Colonel Braddock, Francois
brought me something today...

37:09.169 --> 37:11.364
that I'm sure is of
great interest to you.

37:13.607 --> 37:19.068
It seems your ex-wife has
finally written you a letter.

37:30.957 --> 37:34.484
Unfortunately,
you must be punished...

37:34.527 --> 37:38.588
for the incident with
your late friend... Opelka.

37:38.632 --> 37:39.621
He's dead?

38:06.326 --> 38:07.588
Ho!

38:30.183 --> 38:32.344
Playboy, you want to play?

40:09.182 --> 40:10.206
You!

40:12.085 --> 40:14.485
I've been looking for you.

40:14.521 --> 40:15.818
About time you showed up.

40:15.855 --> 40:17.083
Your headquarters.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.522
You take me
to your headquarters.

40:30.570 --> 40:32.629
Name's Emerson... Clyde Emerson.

40:34.073 --> 40:35.563
No. You don't understand.

40:35.608 --> 40:38.008
Now, what is needed here is a
little courtesy and cooperation.

40:38.044 --> 40:41.241
I'm the point man for
a P.O.W. Search mission.

40:41.281 --> 40:44.682
The I.F.H. Got word of this
little operation some time ago.

40:44.717 --> 40:46.912
I must say, we've had
a devil of a time finding you.

40:46.953 --> 40:48.079
Who is "we"?

40:48.121 --> 40:50.851
Ah, yes. The International
Freedom House.

40:50.890 --> 40:53.723
I'm not just running around the
jungle looking for publicity.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.523
He lie.

40:55.562 --> 40:57.291
It's not a lie.

40:57.330 --> 40:59.025
I'm part of a major operation.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.498
There are nine other scouts
like me.

41:00.533 --> 41:03.297
We each have five square miles
to cover.

41:03.336 --> 41:06.567
And all of us call in
to Central Team regularly.

41:06.606 --> 41:10.736
Now, if you think that's a lie,
you are in a pack of trouble.

41:10.777 --> 41:11.903
Why don't you cooperate...

41:11.945 --> 41:14.140
and save yourself a lot
of needless bloodshed?

41:14.180 --> 41:15.306
What the hell is going on?

41:16.950 --> 41:18.281
Damned if I know.

41:21.020 --> 41:24.148
Do you really expect me
to believe you...

41:24.190 --> 41:25.623
and turn over my whole camp?

41:26.860 --> 41:28.589
Well, under
the circumstances, yes.

41:28.628 --> 41:30.493
I believe that's the only thing
that you can do.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.760
I hid a homing device
out there in the jungle.

41:32.799 --> 41:34.630
My team knows
exactly where I am.

41:34.667 --> 41:36.601
Now, they'll be waiting
for my signal.

41:36.636 --> 41:38.103
Now, if I give it,
they'll come in slowly.

41:38.137 --> 41:40.230
If I don't, they'll come in
fast, and you'll all be dead.

41:40.273 --> 41:41.740
What signal?

41:41.774 --> 41:43.139
Stop playing the fool.

41:44.944 --> 41:46.172
The way I figure it...

41:46.212 --> 41:49.909
these are your choices...
you can either cut and run...

41:49.949 --> 41:51.541
or you can wait
until my team comes in...

41:51.584 --> 41:54.109
and then you can try to run...

41:54.153 --> 41:56.314
or you can cooperate
right now...

41:56.356 --> 41:58.415
and save everyone
a whole lot of trouble.

42:04.197 --> 42:07.394
I believe you left out
some of my options.

42:07.433 --> 42:11.665
One, I could kill you
and the prisoners.

42:12.939 --> 42:14.463
Yes. Missed that one.

42:14.507 --> 42:18.671
And two... I can simply
lock you up...

42:18.711 --> 42:22.807
and wait until you're ready
to give the signal.

42:22.849 --> 42:24.373
Yes, you could lock me up...

42:24.417 --> 42:26.146
but I'll never give you
the signal.

42:26.185 --> 42:27.413
I don't care if you kill me.

42:27.453 --> 42:30.616
Now, look, I'm tired of
hanging around under this sun...

42:30.657 --> 42:33.182
playing footsie with
a half-pint would-be dictator.

42:53.046 --> 42:55.537
Give him anything he wants.

42:55.582 --> 42:56.708
I can't believe it!

42:56.749 --> 42:59.547
We're going home!

42:59.586 --> 43:03.044
OK. I want to know who won
the World Series last year.

43:03.089 --> 43:05.853
I don't know anything about
any bloody World Series, mate.

43:05.892 --> 43:07.018
I'm Australian.

43:07.060 --> 43:08.391
Forget it. I love you anyway.

43:12.665 --> 43:14.326
Yin won't give up this easy.

43:14.367 --> 43:16.232
How large is your rescue team?

43:16.269 --> 43:17.759
Large enough to kick
Yin's ass, huh?

43:21.274 --> 43:22.263
I'm alone.

43:26.746 --> 43:28.077
Alone?

43:28.114 --> 43:29.809
Nobody knows I'm here, mate.

43:31.517 --> 43:33.712
Man, there's nobody
gonna come and get me.

43:33.753 --> 43:35.983
But the International
Freedom House...

43:36.022 --> 43:37.853
The Central Team,
The homing device?

43:37.890 --> 43:40.017
It's just a bluff, isn't it?
I had to tell him something.

43:40.059 --> 43:41.617
I've heard rumors
about this place.

43:41.661 --> 43:42.923
I followed Francois in.

43:42.962 --> 43:44.520
I'm just a lousy
photographer, mate.

43:44.564 --> 43:46.862
I needed pictures for proof.

43:46.899 --> 43:48.025
Damn!

43:48.067 --> 43:51.559
One thing for sure,
he's got guts.

43:51.604 --> 43:56.974
Yeah. Nobody ever broke
into a prison camp.

43:57.010 --> 43:59.843
All right, then, let's get out.
We'll head for the cliffs.

43:59.879 --> 44:01.005
Anything happens to me...

44:01.047 --> 44:02.275
I stashed
some ropes under a big rock.

44:02.315 --> 44:03.577
You can't miss it.
Head for the Thai border...

44:03.616 --> 44:04.981
100 miles due west.
Come on, let's go.

44:05.018 --> 44:08.351
Wait. Yin may let you go...

44:08.388 --> 44:10.652
but he certainly
won't let us all go.

44:10.690 --> 44:11.918
What's that?

44:11.958 --> 44:15.052
It's Francois coming
to pick up his whores.

44:15.094 --> 44:16.959
Shit. He knows I'm alone.

44:16.996 --> 44:17.985
Well, move it!

44:22.168 --> 44:24.329
I'm just going to give
the signal, mate.

44:35.048 --> 44:36.515
Mr. Emerson.

44:36.549 --> 44:37.777
I'm just gonna give my signal.

44:37.817 --> 44:38.943
Good.

44:38.985 --> 44:40.452
Damn.

44:40.486 --> 44:43.148
I hope everyone's told you
how well they have been treated.

44:43.189 --> 44:44.520
Well, they don't love you,
but all in all...

44:44.557 --> 44:46.024
they look pretty good.
I'll be right back.

44:46.059 --> 44:47.549
One more moment, please.

44:50.163 --> 44:52.358
I would like you to meet
a friend of mine.

44:52.398 --> 44:54.332
I'll meet him later.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

44:54.367 --> 44:56.699
I wouldn't want the Central Team
to get impatient, you know.

44:56.736 --> 44:57.930
Francois.

44:59.439 --> 45:03.000
What's the matter, my friend?
You look a little nervous.

45:03.042 --> 45:06.205
He is the goddamn guy who's
been asking questions about us.

45:06.245 --> 45:10.477
He claims he's the point man
for a major rescue operation.

45:10.516 --> 45:13.815
He's lying. He's alone.

45:13.853 --> 45:15.821
I've still got the homing
device out in the jungle.

45:22.962 --> 45:25.590
I am weary of playing footsie
with you.

45:28.167 --> 45:29.395
Take him to the tree.

45:32.672 --> 45:33.866
Move!

45:51.758 --> 45:55.751
For the crimes against
the people of Vietnam...

45:55.795 --> 45:57.695
I sentence you to death.

46:02.702 --> 46:04.932
Don't worry! It's not real!

46:04.971 --> 46:06.598
He's just trying to scare you!

46:06.639 --> 46:08.698
They've got
a lousy sense of humor.

46:24.157 --> 46:27.058
Get up. Get up.

46:28.461 --> 46:30.122
Shut up, you asshole.

46:30.163 --> 46:31.391
You...

46:31.430 --> 46:33.022
We'll get him up.

46:33.065 --> 46:34.123
OK, OK.

46:36.435 --> 46:38.164
I'm OK.

46:48.681 --> 46:49.670
Captain Ho?

47:07.867 --> 47:09.095
He's dying.

47:24.884 --> 47:25.873
Yin!

47:43.536 --> 47:45.094
No, don't do it.

47:45.137 --> 47:46.297
He has to.

47:48.975 --> 47:50.169
What the hell's the difference?

47:54.580 --> 47:57.378
Our struggle was a long one.

47:57.416 --> 48:00.715
As I predicted, you lost.

48:00.753 --> 48:07.317
I'm glad you finally understand
the extent of your guilt.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.657
You do, don't you?

48:08.694 --> 48:11.026
He don't understand shit!

48:15.701 --> 48:16.929
Yes, Colonel Yin...

48:18.738 --> 48:20.399
I understand.

48:35.154 --> 48:36.485
Let's get him up.

48:42.028 --> 48:43.256
Colonel Braddock.

48:46.065 --> 48:48.260
I believe you have
forgotten something.

49:05.952 --> 49:08.352
Now, my American P.O. W...

49:08.387 --> 49:12.084
I will live up to my promise
and will let you go free.

49:12.124 --> 49:16.185
Tomorrow, Francois will be here
and will fly you to Thailand...

49:16.228 --> 49:18.696
and deliver you to your embassy.

49:18.731 --> 49:20.756
You see, Colonel? I told you.

49:22.768 --> 49:24.895
I will try to make
your last day here...

49:24.937 --> 49:26.427
as comfortable as possible.

49:26.472 --> 49:30.738
Here. Come into the next room.
You'll stay there tonight.

49:54.834 --> 49:56.802
I can't believe it.

49:56.836 --> 49:58.565
It's over. We're going home.

49:58.604 --> 50:00.265
I'm going to see my kid!

50:01.674 --> 50:03.073
Something's wrong.

50:03.109 --> 50:04.303
Nothing's wrong.

50:04.343 --> 50:05.640
You've just been here too long.

50:05.678 --> 50:07.009
You're in shock.

50:07.046 --> 50:08.377
I am feeling better.

50:08.414 --> 50:09.574
Yeah, you're feeling better.

50:16.922 --> 50:18.787
Nothing works this fast.

50:21.327 --> 50:23.318
Oh, God! Get him up, Mazilli!

50:23.362 --> 50:24.920
He's been poisoned!

50:24.964 --> 50:27.125
Come on, Franklin!

50:27.166 --> 50:28.292
Come on, on both legs.

50:28.334 --> 50:29.460
Walk!

50:29.502 --> 50:31.197
- Come on.
- Walk, Franklin.

50:31.237 --> 50:33.671
Come on, walk it.
Walk, Franklin!

50:33.706 --> 50:35.833
Is this an American
funeral rite?

50:37.309 --> 50:44.181
I'm afraid I gave poor Franklin
such an overdose of opium...

50:44.216 --> 50:47.845
that he could walk
from here to Los Angeles...

50:47.887 --> 50:49.946
and would not do him any good.

50:53.726 --> 50:54.852
Throw him in the hole.

50:54.894 --> 50:56.885
You son of a bitch.

51:43.643 --> 51:44.940
Wait!

51:46.546 --> 51:50.073
Yin, wait!

51:50.117 --> 51:51.584
Yin!

51:55.489 --> 51:56.979
He's not dead!

52:00.794 --> 52:02.284
God, no!

52:02.329 --> 52:03.921
Oh, God!

52:10.704 --> 52:11.932
Son of a bitch.

59:01.581 --> 59:05.847
Mazilli, I thought
you should know...

59:05.885 --> 59:07.876
that you're completely alone.

59:07.921 --> 59:12.722
Your brave colonel has abandoned
you to die here.

59:12.759 --> 59:13.987
Braddock got away?

59:14.027 --> 59:15.494
He'll die tomorrow.

59:16.896 --> 59:18.056
So will you.

59:19.432 --> 59:20.763
In the meantime...

59:24.103 --> 59:25.934
if you're lonely...

59:29.175 --> 59:30.972
play with your friend.

59:54.767 --> 59:56.132
More wine, Colonel?

59:56.169 --> 59:57.158
No.

01:00:00.807 --> 01:00:02.536
Braddock gone!

01:00:02.575 --> 01:00:03.974
Why keep him alive?

01:00:05.879 --> 01:00:07.278
Now, you know,
I might be wrong...

01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:11.044
but I don't think it's
a very good idea to kill me.

01:00:11.084 --> 01:00:13.416
Why not?

01:00:13.453 --> 01:00:16.513
I could always get
someone to pour my wine.

01:00:19.692 --> 01:00:22.252
It's because
I'm the only one left...

01:00:22.295 --> 01:00:25.526
who really knows how
Colonel Braddock thinks.

01:00:25.565 --> 01:00:26.998
See, he hasn't gone yet.

01:00:29.536 --> 01:00:31.026
Is that so?

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:34.938
Yes. He has stayed to try
and take revenge on you.

01:00:42.448 --> 01:00:44.973
I will use Francois' helicopter.

01:00:45.018 --> 01:00:46.713
We will capture him tomorrow.

01:00:50.823 --> 01:00:53.485
We should have killed that guy
a long time ago.

01:03:19.072 --> 01:03:20.767
We'd better get back.

01:03:20.807 --> 01:03:22.536
You'll never find
this guy alive.

01:03:22.575 --> 01:03:23.735
Just keep searching.

01:04:46.325 --> 01:04:48.225
Braddock come back,
blow bridge down.

01:04:48.261 --> 01:04:50.525
Lock up all the prisoners
and Nester!

01:04:50.563 --> 01:04:51.723
You, to the bridge!

01:04:55.501 --> 01:04:56.661
In there.

01:05:04.877 --> 01:05:06.845
I'll bury him with this.

01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:12.012
My God! It's a bomb!

01:05:12.051 --> 01:05:13.040
Get out!

01:05:22.128 --> 01:05:23.527
Damn American!

01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:58.756
Open it.

01:05:58.798 --> 01:05:59.787
Mazilli!

01:06:02.401 --> 01:06:03.732
What the hell?

01:06:03.769 --> 01:06:05.566
Braddock!

01:06:05.605 --> 01:06:06.629
Let's go!

01:06:09.075 --> 01:06:10.007
Duck!

01:06:15.314 --> 01:06:16.747
Come on! Come on!

01:07:05.097 --> 01:07:08.089
Damn! We got to find that rope.

01:07:13.873 --> 01:07:16.239
They're getting too close.
Let's get out of here.

01:07:16.275 --> 01:07:17.572
It's got to be here.

01:07:20.413 --> 01:07:21.903
Emerson said
they were under a big rock.

01:07:21.948 --> 01:07:23.313
There must be 60 big rocks.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.109
Here it is!

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:32.179
Here.

01:07:46.739 --> 01:07:48.001
Good luck, kid.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.508
- Aren't you coming?
- I'm going after Ho.

01:07:50.543 --> 01:07:53.740
If you're staying to fight,
there's no way I'm leaving you.

01:07:53.779 --> 01:07:56.213
Here they come!
Get your ass down the cliff!

01:12:06.298 --> 01:12:07.629
You idiot!

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.000
Come in.

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:20.736
So, Yin, we're all loaded up.

01:12:20.779 --> 01:12:23.339
I'll see you in about a week.

01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:27.045
Francois, I will need
your helicopter...

01:12:27.086 --> 01:12:28.485
to look for the Americans.

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.385
I believe they've gone down
the river.

01:12:30.422 --> 01:12:32.151
I am sorry. I can't help you.

01:12:32.191 --> 01:12:33.522
You will not go.

01:12:35.127 --> 01:12:37.425
I am going.

01:12:37.463 --> 01:12:38.896
Come on, let's go.

01:12:38.931 --> 01:12:42.367
Get your hands off...
What the hell are you doing?

01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:44.665
They are following my order.

01:12:46.005 --> 01:12:50.999
They needed a new leader after
they heard that you had died.

01:14:17.196 --> 01:14:18.185
Ho.

01:16:07.272 --> 01:16:08.466
Opelka.

01:16:08.507 --> 01:16:09.667
Colonel.

01:16:18.317 --> 01:16:19.682
I'm glad you made it, kid.

01:16:19.718 --> 01:16:23.017
Thanks, Colonel.
Yin must have given up on me.

01:16:23.055 --> 01:16:24.317
He thought you were dead.

01:16:26.058 --> 01:16:27.719
How come you hung around?

01:16:27.759 --> 01:16:28.919
I don't know.

01:16:30.395 --> 01:16:32.260
I guess it was just
some kind of instinct.

01:16:38.203 --> 01:16:40.603
I want you to guard the base.

01:16:40.639 --> 01:16:42.368
If I'm not back in 24 hours...

01:16:42.407 --> 01:16:44.136
go down the river
and try to find Mazilli.

01:16:46.411 --> 01:16:51.678
Colonel, I know you don't need
me to guard the base.

01:16:51.717 --> 01:16:53.947
I want to help you
get those bastards.

01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:04.822
Colonel Braddock!

01:17:17.242 --> 01:17:19.176
Yin's our enemy, too.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:22.840
I'll kill him!

01:17:24.249 --> 01:17:27.776
The fighting's over!
We all go home!

01:17:29.488 --> 01:17:30.614
Colonel Braddock!

01:17:30.656 --> 01:17:31.645
Dou Chou.

01:17:34.259 --> 01:17:35.920
He's listening.
He knows we're here.

01:17:44.937 --> 01:17:47.497
Yin dead. Believe now.

01:17:47.539 --> 01:17:49.439
See, Colonel Braddock?

01:17:51.009 --> 01:17:52.943
Come look for yourself.
Yin dead!

01:17:56.381 --> 01:17:58.815
Sir, the boots. That's not Yin.

01:18:14.166 --> 01:18:15.292
I'm going after Ho.

01:18:15.334 --> 01:18:17.029
He's in one of those two shacks
down there.

01:18:17.069 --> 01:18:21.028
If there's any fireworks,
here, throw these grenades.

01:18:22.474 --> 01:18:25.068
Sir, what about Nester?

01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:27.044
He can take care of himself.

01:18:27.079 --> 01:18:28.239
He always has.

01:18:32.317 --> 01:18:33.477
He won't show.

01:18:39.558 --> 01:18:40.718
He'll come.

01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:02.747
Good. They got Mazilli.

01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:03.770
Let's go.

01:19:21.266 --> 01:19:23.325
Colonel Braddock!

01:19:33.512 --> 01:19:37.141
I'll give you
30 seconds to decide...

01:19:37.182 --> 01:19:40.379
whether you want Mazilli
to live or die.

01:20:02.407 --> 01:20:04.602
Your 30 seconds is up!

01:20:05.977 --> 01:20:10.277
You have just murdered
your last man.

01:20:10.315 --> 01:20:12.783
Psst. Mazilli...

01:20:12.818 --> 01:20:15.048
anything you want me
to tell your kid?

01:20:17.923 --> 01:20:19.720
Hold it!

01:20:19.758 --> 01:20:21.055
Mazilli is mine.

01:20:23.028 --> 01:20:25.053
Why don't we just tell
the kid that Daddy...

01:20:25.097 --> 01:20:30.433
was a very brave soldier
right up till the very end?

01:20:35.474 --> 01:20:36.532
Down!

01:20:40.145 --> 01:20:41.442
Move it, Mazilli!

01:21:06.605 --> 01:21:08.937
Nester... he came back to us.

01:21:08.974 --> 01:21:09.963
Yeah, I know.

01:21:11.309 --> 01:21:12.469
I'm going after Ho.

01:21:34.332 --> 01:21:36.163
Cover us, Ho. We're going in.

01:21:45.343 --> 01:21:48.312
Colonel, they're all
in Yin's house.

01:21:48.346 --> 01:21:49.574
Opelka!

01:21:49.614 --> 01:21:50.603
Lieutenant.

01:21:55.487 --> 01:21:56.977
Opelka, left flank.

01:21:58.523 --> 01:22:01.151
Mazilli, around back.

01:22:01.193 --> 01:22:02.319
Wait.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.260
Ready? Go!

01:22:04.296 --> 01:22:05.593
Now!

01:23:43.461 --> 01:23:44.894
Nobody could have lived
through this.

01:23:46.831 --> 01:23:47.820
Colonel.

01:24:11.623 --> 01:24:13.113
Remember how to fly this thing?

01:24:13.158 --> 01:24:14.318
You better believe it.

01:25:17.956 --> 01:25:20.015
You really didn't think
I'd leave...

01:25:20.058 --> 01:25:21.719
without knowing for sure
you were dead?

01:25:24.796 --> 01:25:27.026
You'll not just kill me.

01:25:27.065 --> 01:25:30.228
You want to know
who the better man is.

01:25:31.569 --> 01:25:35.869
That is why you stayed behind.

01:25:35.907 --> 01:25:38.467
I also want to know.

01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:42.947
That is why I kept you alive
all these years.

01:25:46.251 --> 01:25:48.776
Now it is the time...

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:52.950
You and I, one-on-one.

01:25:52.991 --> 01:25:54.151
No politics...

01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.150
no weapons.

01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:10.498
Just a little game to find out
who is the better man.

01:26:15.847 --> 01:26:18.816
I knew you could not
resist my challenge.

01:26:27.325 --> 01:26:30.761
Colonel Yin,
for the atrocities inflicted...

01:26:30.795 --> 01:26:33.525
on the Vietnamese and American
prisoners of this camp...

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.368
I sentence you to death.

01:28:41.793 --> 01:28:43.192
This is for Nester.

01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:53.798
Not yet.

01:29:25.136 --> 01:29:27.001
The game's over.

01:30:03.708 --> 01:30:05.437
And this is for Franklin.

01:30:14.952 --> 01:30:16.283
You lose.

01:31:13.344 --> 01:31:14.504
This is for me.
