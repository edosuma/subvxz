WEBVTT

00:00.055 --> 00:02.733
I shall be leaving for the Red Zone
after this meeting.

00:02.820 --> 00:05.432
I do think the current climate
is unfavourable

00:05.468 --> 00:06.924
for a visit by you, Prime Minister.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.705
Running scared from the current climate

00:08.740 --> 00:09.863
has never done us any favours.

00:10.180 --> 00:12.225
Anna, I can't tell you
how relieved I was

00:12.260 --> 00:15.673
to hear you hadn't burned alive
in that hotel.

00:15.709 --> 00:17.469
And hubby back safely, too.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.694
You have to say that Georgia
provided all the drugs.

00:24.730 --> 00:25.690
No way.

00:25.726 --> 00:28.281
This will all blow over soon,
as long as we stick to the script.

00:28.317 --> 00:29.745
You need him to lie to parliament.

00:30.332 --> 00:31.460
That's what gets them in the end.

00:31.577 --> 00:34.399
Have you ever seen a transformer?
They're not small, you know.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.505
So, give me the leftie take
on Harry Rowntree.

00:36.540 --> 00:39.105
He's a thug and a bully,
but he acts entirely on principles.

00:39.140 --> 00:43.245
I have far greater trust
in people's justice

00:43.281 --> 00:45.682
than in the bleatings
of the diversity lobby.

00:45.718 --> 00:48.923
I really recommend you don't go
outside, the mood is very ugly.

00:48.959 --> 00:52.225
There is no justice
but the law in this country.

00:52.595 --> 00:55.716
To the charlatans
who try to make political capital

00:55.752 --> 00:58.459
out of the suffering of others,
I say this.

00:58.495 --> 01:00.575
There will be a reckoning.

01:01.836 --> 01:05.915
I promise you,
we will turn the lights on again!

01:10.640 --> 01:13.325
This is Gold Commander.
How's your progress, Owen?

01:13.871 --> 01:17.599
Yeah, cos of the situation on the
A1, I've had to go up the M6

01:17.635 --> 01:19.405
across the top of the north Pennines.

01:19.469 --> 01:21.154
OK, what's your ETA?

01:21.190 --> 01:24.430
Not long. I've just come off
the A69, past Hexham.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.325
Hold on.
There's a police checkpoint ahead.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.485
I'm gonna have to pull over.

01:30.731 --> 01:33.205
Hold on. Do you mean an Army checkpoint?

01:33.240 --> 01:35.021
There's no police checkpoints
on the A69.

01:37.039 --> 01:38.170
Owen?

01:41.040 --> 01:42.200
Hello, Officer.

02:18.247 --> 02:20.289
With looting a massive problem
in the Red Zone

02:20.325 --> 02:23.165
and emergency services
overstretched and understaffed,

02:23.200 --> 02:26.565
the original Protection Patrols have
merged with other civic groups

02:26.600 --> 02:28.765
under the umbrella term
"People's Justice".

02:28.800 --> 02:30.636
And I'm joined now
by one of their members.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.045
So, Scott Minett,
who are People's Justice?

02:34.685 --> 02:36.885
Just a collection of ordinary citizens,

02:36.920 --> 02:39.165
organising to support our communities,

02:39.200 --> 02:42.845
protect our vulnerable people
and stop the looting.

02:43.416 --> 02:46.365
Some people have accused you of
being nothing more than vigilantes

02:46.400 --> 02:48.645
with an ugly undercurrent of racism.

02:48.680 --> 02:52.005
Some people? Well, that's
obviously how the media in London

02:52.040 --> 02:54.805
- wants people to see things, aye.
- How do you see it?

02:55.292 --> 02:58.605
Well, look around you.
Nobody cares about us,

02:58.640 --> 03:01.485
unless there's an election on
and they're after our votes.

03:02.147 --> 03:05.387
You lot, you call me and my friends
and my family racists,

03:05.716 --> 03:08.485
we hardly spend any time at all
talking about immigration.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.725
The way youse lot go on,

03:09.760 --> 03:11.216
you'd think it' was the only thing
we thought about.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.005
I mean, if you're asking us what
I think about what happened

03:15.040 --> 03:18.045
to that bloke who got lynched,
I think that was wrong.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.085
Of course I do.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.951
But if we think that our kids should
speak English at school, in England,

03:22.987 --> 03:25.765
and we should be able to put our
own flags up during the World Cup,

03:25.800 --> 03:27.565
then that doesn't make us racist,
does it?

03:28.051 --> 03:30.056
Black people are proud of their culture.

03:30.457 --> 03:32.445
"Black is beautiful,"
that's what they say.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.045
Now, why should we not say the same
about white people?

03:35.394 --> 03:37.194
Why should "white" be an insult?

03:38.140 --> 03:42.065
You people, you talk about diversity
and you talk about respect,

03:42.100 --> 03:44.445
but then you apply it
to everyone except us.

03:45.229 --> 03:48.725
People who own the media,
people who run things in this country,

03:48.760 --> 03:50.978
they wanna make us out to be scum,

03:51.754 --> 03:53.965
even though it was my grandad
that built the ships

03:54.000 --> 03:55.525
that made this country great,

03:55.560 --> 03:58.005
and I actually fought for this country.

03:58.176 --> 04:02.165
I'll tell you what it is, right?
Family comes first, that's obvious.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.525
Then, after that, it's country,
it's culture and community.

04:05.957 --> 04:08.205
And then if I've got anything left
after them three,

04:08.240 --> 04:09.850
I'm happy to stick my hand in my pocket.

04:10.048 --> 04:13.736
You don't like that, take a look at
99% of the people in this country,

04:13.772 --> 04:15.318
and that includes the immigrants...

04:15.691 --> 04:18.154
Kids on YouTube are doing
the People's Justice salute now.

04:18.190 --> 04:19.103
They've gone national.

04:19.140 --> 04:21.130
No wonder,
with the coverage he's getting.

04:21.365 --> 04:24.173
Practically got a dedicated camera
team following his every move.

04:24.556 --> 04:25.761
I'll catch you later.

04:25.797 --> 04:26.802
Prime Minister.

04:27.966 --> 04:30.525
We need to talk about
the situation with Ellie.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.474
Peter's dealing with it.
Along with my wife.

04:32.510 --> 04:34.165
That's one of my concerns.

04:34.621 --> 04:36.048
In the car on the way to the Red Zone...

04:36.084 --> 04:38.489
My head was in a spin
about the visits. It'll be fine.

04:38.525 --> 04:40.374
- Robert, it won't...
- Stay in your lane, Anna.

04:40.485 --> 04:41.860
Stay in my...

04:42.336 --> 04:43.342
Fraser.

04:44.238 --> 04:47.019
Another fuel tanker
has been hijacked in the Red Zone.

04:47.886 --> 04:50.461
Only this time
they pistol whipped the driver

04:50.634 --> 04:52.577
and he suffered a cardiac arrest.

04:53.336 --> 04:56.999
Owen Harding, popular figure,
has a couple of kids.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.064
He's in intensive care.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.325
Arrange for someone
to speak to his wife,

05:01.360 --> 05:02.858
make sure she has everything she needs.

05:02.894 --> 05:06.179
The Lorry Drivers' Union are under
pressure from some of their members

05:06.215 --> 05:09.684
to call a national stoppage
in protest at the latest attack.

05:11.370 --> 05:14.325
Needless to say, a fuel delivery
stoppage, even for 24 hours,

05:14.360 --> 05:15.428
would cripple us completely.

05:15.464 --> 05:17.869
So, we bring in the Army,
confiscate their assets...

05:17.905 --> 05:19.622
I'll be speaking to Mr Rowntree
this morning.

05:19.658 --> 05:22.023
Moving on, I understand
Protection Patrols

05:22.059 --> 05:24.415
are now calling themselves
People's Justice.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.144
Snappy name.

05:27.227 --> 05:30.077
And they have a new poster boy,
de facto leader.

05:30.803 --> 05:33.099
I assume some background checks
have taken place?

05:34.667 --> 05:36.285
Scott Arthur Minett.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.125
Former soldier who served honourably
in Afghanistan,

05:39.160 --> 05:42.198
now leading The People's Justice
in the Red Zone.

05:42.432 --> 05:44.965
He and his men have already seized
valuable fuel reserves

05:45.000 --> 05:46.876
from various locations.

05:47.191 --> 05:49.100
He's well-respected in the community.

05:49.287 --> 05:50.352
Big family ties,

05:50.388 --> 05:53.244
with four children from
different previous relationships,

05:53.280 --> 05:55.405
to whom he is apparently devoted.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.805
Two of his daughters are mixed-race,
by the way.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.281
Fraser? What about the
Red Zone transformer?

05:59.317 --> 06:02.131
First we needed to check
that it wasn't damaged at sea.

06:02.167 --> 06:04.429
It's in Tilbury Docks.
My staff are down there now.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.804
But it will be moving soon?

06:06.938 --> 06:08.928
- Yes.
- Good.

06:09.822 --> 06:12.960
OK. I have to leave. Julia,
you can take us through the rest.

06:13.595 --> 06:15.685
It is customary for
the Home Secretary...

06:15.720 --> 06:18.095
We left the realm of the customary
some time ago, Archie.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.504
- Robert!
- Give me a sec.

06:25.791 --> 06:29.226
Will I have to start asking people
to get you to pass me the salt?

06:30.834 --> 06:35.205
You tried to ruin our trip
to the Red Zone with that interview.

06:36.127 --> 06:39.045
Have you seen our approval ratings
in this morning's YouGov?

06:39.275 --> 06:42.257
- "Our" as in the party?
- No. As in you and me.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.285
You're riding a tiger here, Archie.
We both know how that one ends.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.645
I am the fucking tiger, Robert.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.003
You may be able to force me out,

06:52.282 --> 06:53.935
but can you get yourself in?

06:54.800 --> 06:56.043
The party won't have you.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.325
- She give you that line, did she?
- Oh, who, Anna?

07:00.360 --> 07:01.971
No, no, she's your biggest fan.

07:02.438 --> 07:04.444
Sadly, it's not reciprocated.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.718
And I look forward to the day

07:05.754 --> 07:09.124
Dominic Knight takes his rightful
place in the policy unit again.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.640
That's the day I no longer have
any say on the matter.

07:13.109 --> 07:18.275
You know, one of the things I'd miss
about not having the top job

07:18.311 --> 07:21.085
is trips to foreign museums
with no crowds.

07:21.492 --> 07:24.085
Last time I was in Madrid,
they took me round the Prado.

07:24.241 --> 07:27.565
Anyway, one painting in there
particularly caught my eye.

07:28.162 --> 07:29.405
By Goya.

07:29.808 --> 07:33.831
Two men in the mud beating each other
to death with clubs.

07:35.863 --> 07:38.117
- I'll have to Google it.
- You do that.

07:39.276 --> 07:40.906
I won't sack you,
if that's what you're looking for.

07:40.942 --> 07:42.234
I won't resign.

08:14.069 --> 08:15.264
Hey, Fraser, it's Steph.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.328
Yeah. It's all going fine.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.963
We're gonna be on the road shortly,

08:18.999 --> 08:20.865
so I'll give you a ring
when we get off the M25.

08:20.900 --> 08:21.920
OK, bye.

08:23.757 --> 08:25.722
...major incident has been declared.

08:26.104 --> 08:28.744
The arrival of a super-transformer
from Germany has raised hopes

08:28.780 --> 08:32.667
that the power crisis that has
brought misery to Northumberland

08:32.703 --> 08:33.788
might be nearing an end.

08:34.534 --> 08:36.698
Today, the Prime Minister,
Robert Sutherland,

08:36.734 --> 08:39.568
restated his promise
to turn the lights back on,

08:39.734 --> 08:43.385
while warning the process of moving
and installing the transformer

08:43.447 --> 08:45.190
might still take some time.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.559
Critics argue
that it is too little, too late.

08:48.860 --> 08:51.940
And the opposition has repeated
its call for him to resign.

08:55.399 --> 08:57.024
- He saw her serve it.
- Big deal.

08:57.060 --> 08:59.447
Racking out a line of coke
doesn't mean you supplied it.

08:59.483 --> 09:00.707
Bad optics.

09:01.427 --> 09:03.078
I don't care about the optics.

09:03.687 --> 09:06.865
Oh, I was fearing this piece,
but nothing in this article

09:06.900 --> 09:09.065
means she bought and supplied the drugs.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.624
- The police will talk to her again.
- Yeah, of course they will.

09:16.525 --> 09:18.146
Ellie's not coping well.

09:18.805 --> 09:22.665
I know. But we will get her through
this, if we just hold the line.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.105
- I...
- Thank you, Peter.

09:24.140 --> 09:26.700
I know you understand
what's at stake here.

09:33.766 --> 09:35.931
- Francine.
- Prime Minister.

09:36.180 --> 09:38.422
My mole in the union tells me
they're going to use this

09:38.458 --> 09:40.940
to demand a review of the pay floor.
Off the record, obviously.

09:40.976 --> 09:42.131
You think I should give it to them?

09:42.167 --> 09:43.720
Yes, because it's actually
the right thing to do.

09:43.756 --> 09:46.197
Oh, well.
Hire lefties, get lefties, I suppose.

09:46.233 --> 09:47.918
But no, if you want him to back off.

09:48.101 --> 09:50.222
Ultimately, he wants your head
on a pike.

09:50.258 --> 09:52.378
Well, I must be doing
something right, then.

09:53.788 --> 09:56.673
So, let's hear what Comrade Rowntree
has to say.

09:56.709 --> 09:57.829
Can you show them in?

10:00.471 --> 10:01.551
Prime Minister.

10:03.377 --> 10:05.702
Disappointed to see you
with this lot, Francine.

10:05.738 --> 10:08.256
In fairness, this lot don't throw
bricks at my office window.

10:08.291 --> 10:09.291
Yet.

10:09.522 --> 10:12.785
I didn't approve of the way you
were handled by your constituency.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.927
- Thank you.
- But working for them...

10:16.616 --> 10:18.381
...it's like crossing a picket line.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.030
But is it as bad as denying
essential food and supplies

10:21.066 --> 10:23.172
to suffering people
at a time of national emergency

10:23.208 --> 10:24.728
just to be Billy Big Bollocks?

10:26.640 --> 10:28.480
That's another reason why I miss you.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.400
- Door's always open.
- I'll keep that in mind.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.840
Shall we begin?

10:53.540 --> 10:55.520
Time to show them
we're not fucking around.

10:55.940 --> 10:57.087
This is it!

10:57.162 --> 10:58.202
Come on!

11:00.000 --> 11:02.080
Gold Command is downstairs, lads.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.188
Oi!

11:09.460 --> 11:11.180
No! You can't go in there!

11:13.977 --> 11:15.865
Stop! Stop, now!

11:15.900 --> 11:16.940
Pack it in!

11:18.428 --> 11:20.073
You're not authorised to be here.

11:20.109 --> 11:22.479
Need access to the fuel reserves, now!

11:32.240 --> 11:35.085
- You're that guy who was on the TV.
- Aye.

11:35.121 --> 11:36.345
You know something,

11:37.541 --> 11:38.945
I really don't like you.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.920
- No?
- No.

11:44.700 --> 11:48.585
I think you're a snide,
dressed-by-your-ma racist.

11:49.355 --> 11:52.570
And don't try the "ignored white
working-class" number on me either.

11:53.472 --> 11:54.986
If you're so hard-working,

11:55.022 --> 11:57.940
how come you've got enough time
on your hands to be such a cunt?

11:59.113 --> 12:02.278
And who appointed you
to represent anybody?

12:02.462 --> 12:06.382
Do I fucking sound like
I come from the London elite?

12:07.112 --> 12:08.997
Do I fucking look like it?!

12:10.864 --> 12:11.944
Oh...

12:13.515 --> 12:15.132
You know what I reckon about you?

12:18.020 --> 12:20.029
I just reckon you need
a good night's kip.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.705
I am the Gold Commander.

12:23.740 --> 12:26.237
Get your hands
off my fucking shoulders now.

12:27.660 --> 12:28.980
Just looked a bit tense.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.646
- Right, get rid of these people.
- He's armed, sir.

12:35.682 --> 12:37.079
We don't have support.

12:39.746 --> 12:43.706
Oh, aye, we get a lot of rabbits
around here, don't we?

12:45.720 --> 12:47.120
Sometimes we shoot them.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.120
Just give us the keys, eh?

13:12.740 --> 13:14.540
You want to make me give them to you?

13:16.800 --> 13:18.760
Well, I think we'll manage without them.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.380
What do you reckon, lads?

13:26.066 --> 13:27.191
- Get up.
- Up!

13:27.227 --> 13:29.147
Up! Get up! Go.

14:04.220 --> 14:06.300
I'll be back
after you're long gone, son.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.705
These are highly-skilled drivers,

14:20.740 --> 14:23.545
there are massive
safety issues involved.

14:23.580 --> 14:28.945
Owen Harding isn't the first to be
attacked by these hijacking gangs.

14:28.980 --> 14:32.265
We did train soldiers during
the last fuel crisis, remember?

14:32.300 --> 14:34.505
Oh, and they're on call right now
are they?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.905
You need to get the tankers
out of the depots,

14:36.940 --> 14:38.665
which might not be so easy

14:38.700 --> 14:41.500
if my members decide
to take matters further.

14:47.900 --> 14:52.180
Look, the other option is armed escorts.

14:53.677 --> 14:56.865
I also understand you wish to discuss
the pay floor again.

14:56.900 --> 15:00.100
Pay floor should certainly come
into discussions, yeah.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.825
I'm sorry,
we have an emergency situation.

15:08.860 --> 15:10.745
We'll have to reconvene at a later date.

15:10.780 --> 15:13.145
So... Are you...
Are you throwing us out?

15:13.180 --> 15:16.360
Well, it's a nice day, you could have
a little stroll round the garden.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.137
OK. Fine.

15:22.060 --> 15:26.620
Just remember, it's not us who's
under pressure here, Prime Minister.

15:35.366 --> 15:37.234
What's the situation with Gold Command?

15:37.540 --> 15:39.905
Gold Commander
is waiting for us to do something.

15:40.188 --> 15:41.985
I told him to go home, he's exhausted.

15:42.020 --> 15:43.935
This is the road to anarchy.
I cannot allow it.

15:43.971 --> 15:44.971
It is.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.256
Get me that secure line
with General Pickering.

15:47.292 --> 15:49.777
- What are you gonna do?
- Send in the troops,

15:49.813 --> 15:51.785
clear that rabble and restore order.

15:52.182 --> 15:54.585
Reconvene COBRA
till this situation is dealt with.

15:54.799 --> 15:57.306
- What about relief flights?
- Let's keep those coming in for now.

15:59.396 --> 16:02.244
General, we have a problem
in the Red Zone.

16:09.592 --> 16:12.702
Francine Bridge, any comment on the
current situation in the Red Zone?

16:13.260 --> 16:15.225
No comment. No comment.

16:15.260 --> 16:18.300
Sorry, no comment. No comment.

16:20.060 --> 16:21.260
Ooh...

16:22.680 --> 16:24.045
How's the insomnia?

16:24.731 --> 16:27.116
It's my dad's funeral coming up,
which isn't helping.

16:27.152 --> 16:30.404
- Oh. Funerals are stressful.
- This one in particular.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.440
- How come?
- My ex-wife.

16:33.620 --> 16:36.647
She's convinced the kids I'm the one
behind all the hamster deaths.

16:38.804 --> 16:41.724
- Tell her she can't come.
- It's not that easy.

16:42.493 --> 16:45.098
My dad loved his grandkids,
he'd want them there.

16:45.912 --> 16:50.385
Still, I've got a cockerpoo
riding shotgun.

16:50.853 --> 16:53.295
- That's it?
- Afraid so.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.305
Well, do you want some human
moral support?

16:56.937 --> 16:59.752
It was my Aunty Charmaine's funeral
back in Jamaica last month.

16:59.788 --> 17:01.360
Believe me, I don't think
your ex-wife has got anything

17:01.396 --> 17:03.097
to match the fireworks at that one.

17:03.996 --> 17:05.223
You'd really come along?

17:05.260 --> 17:07.751
Sure. Be more use to you than a dog.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.819
- My... My kids know who you are.
- Well, I was the future once.

17:16.031 --> 17:18.089
Listen, the offer's there
if you want it, all right?

17:18.126 --> 17:19.090
Just let me know.

17:19.609 --> 17:21.981
I will. Thanks, Francine.

17:26.859 --> 17:27.838
Listen to them, man.

17:27.874 --> 17:30.086
They're trying to make us out
to be a bunch of White Nationalists.

17:30.251 --> 17:31.256
There you are, son.

17:31.782 --> 17:33.587
I've got two mixed-race kids, right?

17:33.740 --> 17:35.858
You'll not hear about that
in the mainstream media.

17:35.894 --> 17:37.830
I am the mainstream media.

17:39.370 --> 17:40.644
- It's Manish, right?
- Yeah.

17:41.180 --> 17:43.425
Manish, I don't blame
anyone here for this.

17:43.561 --> 17:45.246
I blame all of this on London.

17:45.503 --> 17:46.956
How about Kemal Hussain?

17:47.140 --> 17:49.545
Ugh. I told you,
tensions were running high,

17:49.580 --> 17:50.961
there was a rapist on the loose.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.585
Anyway, no-one's bothering you,
are they?

17:53.621 --> 17:55.145
Yeah! That might be
because I'm with you.

17:55.181 --> 17:56.681
Aye, well,
you better stick with us, then.

17:58.296 --> 18:00.435
Show the people's side
of things for once.

18:01.836 --> 18:06.256
Cavalry's arriving now. Better
round up the resistance, eh, lads?

18:07.380 --> 18:08.965
Aye, stick with us, Manish,

18:09.217 --> 18:11.438
cos I think things are
about to get pretty tasty.

18:53.560 --> 18:57.720
CCC! CCC! CCC! CCC!

18:59.765 --> 19:01.872
...members of People's Justice
are in the crowd.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.560
They could be armed. What is the orders?

19:05.779 --> 19:08.253
Hold your position. I need to speak
to the Prime Minister.

19:12.924 --> 19:16.169
I do detect some unease
among the troops at this operation.

19:16.205 --> 19:18.410
This is not what they feel
they should be doing.

19:18.446 --> 19:20.978
They're right, it isn't.
But we can't have mob rule.

19:21.014 --> 19:23.348
They are aware
that Scott Minett is a veteran

19:23.384 --> 19:25.534
who still has close links
to serving troops.

19:25.570 --> 19:26.893
He's also breaking the law.

19:26.929 --> 19:29.214
If I am ordered to do so,
then of course I will go in,

19:29.250 --> 19:31.375
but word is some of the
protestors are armed.

19:31.411 --> 19:33.347
Then they're not protestors,
they're paramilitaries.

19:33.383 --> 19:36.201
Would you authorise the use
of lethal force against them?

19:36.237 --> 19:38.922
There are people in that camp
who will be very vulnerable

19:38.958 --> 19:40.323
if it all kicks off.

19:40.895 --> 19:44.020
- So, now you care about them?
- Sorry, I have to be absolutely clear

19:44.056 --> 19:47.135
on what my men will be permitted
to do once inside the hospital.

19:47.171 --> 19:51.086
Any casualties, even arrests,
run the risk of creating martyrs.

19:51.614 --> 19:53.459
You should use restraint,
Prime Minister.

19:53.495 --> 19:55.520
Nothing to be gained
by trying to act tough.

19:55.556 --> 19:57.329
- Whether we like it or not,

19:57.365 --> 19:59.664
Minett represents a lot of people now.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.792
Not just in the affected areas.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.165
Going in, I think it's unwise, Robert.

20:04.201 --> 20:06.506
There will be consequences
you might not be able to handle.

20:06.868 --> 20:09.789
All right, Archie.
Those are perfectly fair points.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.505
General, please instruct your soldiers

20:12.541 --> 20:14.518
to hold their position
until further notice.

20:16.151 --> 20:19.596
We also need to keep an eye
on the lorry drivers.

20:19.632 --> 20:22.757
Our intelligence suggests that
Rowntree's grip on the rank and file

20:22.793 --> 20:23.918
isn't so strong,

20:24.088 --> 20:26.986
and many of them are sympathetic
to People's Justice.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.245
One thing at a time.

20:28.281 --> 20:31.352
That might be a luxury
we don't have, of course.

20:33.610 --> 20:35.735
Good spot on Archie's strategy in there.

20:35.771 --> 20:38.232
He knows storming in
is the wrong decision.

20:38.490 --> 20:39.755
He only pushed it

20:39.791 --> 20:41.731
in the hope it would make you do it
and have to wear it.

20:42.256 --> 20:44.361
Still not sure it is the wrong decision.

20:45.140 --> 20:47.325
What if we send a relief plane

20:47.361 --> 20:49.706
with a special snatch squad
instead of supplies?

20:50.140 --> 20:52.325
You mean like a... like a Trojan horse?

20:52.361 --> 20:53.508
Yeah.

20:54.733 --> 20:56.302
Well, as an idea, that's erm...

20:58.033 --> 20:59.833
Well, you do know what that is,
don't you?

20:59.869 --> 21:01.589
- What?
- Total bollocks.

21:12.340 --> 21:13.640
I have to call Sam.

21:19.657 --> 21:21.265
- Hey, Ellie.
- Hi, Anna. Is Dad in?

21:21.301 --> 21:22.501
I need to speak to him.

21:25.070 --> 21:26.195
Dad...

21:26.231 --> 21:28.431
Hello. What's happening?
Are the kids OK?

21:32.411 --> 21:35.056
All right. Uh, meet me
at Maddy's flat in Pimlico.

21:40.634 --> 21:42.572
Georgia's dad came to see me.

21:42.608 --> 21:44.727
He says he wants me to tell the truth.

21:45.476 --> 21:48.601
He wants me to tell the police
it was me that provided the drugs.

21:48.637 --> 21:50.682
- OK, well, he's obviously grieving.
- Dad!

21:51.140 --> 21:53.005
The thing is, in situations like this,

21:53.041 --> 21:54.446
how does pointing the finger...

21:54.482 --> 21:57.536
Because he thinks the finger
is pointing at Georgia

21:57.572 --> 22:01.852
and he thinks that that is unjust,
especially with the whole...

22:02.451 --> 22:04.176
You know, this whole racial thing.

22:04.212 --> 22:05.437
But that's not true, is it?

22:06.039 --> 22:08.690
I mean, no-one is pointing
any fingers because Georgia's...

22:16.813 --> 22:17.813
Look...

22:24.060 --> 22:26.440
...I'm speaking as your parent now.

22:29.010 --> 22:30.735
Watching you get your degree...

22:30.771 --> 22:33.531
- I can't think about that now!
- It's so sad, Ellie.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.021
Lots of young people take drugs
when they are at university.

22:37.057 --> 22:39.010
- Did you?
- No.

22:39.951 --> 22:41.987
I was too busy reading Locke and Hume.

22:43.448 --> 22:46.347
Also, I was the wrong generation
for all the exciting ones.

22:50.860 --> 22:54.680
But most people who do
take them don't die.

22:57.348 --> 23:00.476
What happened to Georgia was tragic,

23:01.320 --> 23:05.431
and no confessions, no punishment
is gonna bring her back,

23:05.800 --> 23:07.560
which is what her family really want.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.480
Shh, sweetheart.

23:23.210 --> 23:25.742
Don't cry, don't cry.

23:25.909 --> 23:28.560
She was my best friend, Dad.

23:30.293 --> 23:32.603
I miss her so much.

23:36.099 --> 23:39.219
It's... gonna be all right. You'll see.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.220
This is all gonna blow over.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.400
Where'd you get these?

23:59.780 --> 24:02.820
They were sent to me anonymously
at the office.

24:08.620 --> 24:10.380
So, this is after the hotel fire?

24:14.520 --> 24:17.960
So, I assume you were with him
in the hotel, then?

24:25.320 --> 24:26.460
OK.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.140
Do you love him?

24:39.280 --> 24:40.440
I don't know.

24:44.640 --> 24:47.245
I've slept with other women
during our marriage,

24:47.542 --> 24:50.597
- which I suspect that you know.
- I preferred suspicion to knowledge.

24:50.633 --> 24:52.953
Well, either way,
I don't wanna be a hypocrite.

24:56.513 --> 24:58.458
So, what, are you unhappy
in this marriage?

24:58.494 --> 24:59.534
No, not at all.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.900
I don't really have time to be unhappy.

25:08.931 --> 25:11.147
On the occasions our paths cross,

25:12.701 --> 25:14.631
I'm always really happy to see you.

25:17.231 --> 25:19.129
Well, I guess not everyone can say that.

25:19.560 --> 25:20.720
They really can't.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.300
And the kids?

25:29.616 --> 25:32.191
I'll come and speak to them, explain
that I'm staying here for a bit.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.962
There's a few things
I need to sort out with regards...

25:38.380 --> 25:39.680
Everything.

26:30.819 --> 26:32.280
Eleanor, it's Anna Marshall here.

26:32.316 --> 26:34.172
I need to speak to you
about something important.

26:38.573 --> 26:41.086
Order! Order!

26:41.122 --> 26:45.348
Let me assure the House
that every step is being taken

26:45.384 --> 26:48.925
in order to break the deadlock at
the Royal Northumberland Hospital.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.765
We will restore legitimate authority
to the Red Zone,

26:52.800 --> 26:56.350
and it is completely intolerable

26:56.386 --> 27:00.605
that unelected vigilantes attempt
to seize control of this situation.

27:00.640 --> 27:03.565
- Hear, hear.
- I will, of course, attempt to find

27:03.600 --> 27:05.845
a peaceful and negotiated settlement

27:05.880 --> 27:08.085
and that is what is currently happening.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.960
Mr Thomas Hyndley!

27:12.280 --> 27:13.965
Thank you, Mr Speaker.

27:14.433 --> 27:17.365
In light of the events
that we have been witnessing,

27:17.400 --> 27:19.845
I welcome
the Prime Minister's commitment

27:19.880 --> 27:22.161
to the rule of law and due process.

27:22.683 --> 27:27.088
Mr Speaker, with that in mind,
will he give me an assurance

27:27.392 --> 27:31.725
that there will not be,
nor has been any interference

27:31.760 --> 27:36.724
into the police investigation
into the death of Georgia Nixon

27:36.760 --> 27:38.605
from a fentanyl overdose,

27:38.641 --> 27:42.285
and also, Mr Speaker, that none
of the witnesses of the case

27:42.320 --> 27:45.448
have been coached
by members of his staff?

27:48.114 --> 27:50.354
Mr Speaker, Mr Speaker.

27:50.984 --> 27:56.849
First, may I say how shocked I was
by the death of Georgia Nixon.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.034
She was, as I'm sure you're
all aware, known to my family.

28:00.480 --> 28:03.907
She was a delightful girl,
with her whole life ahead of her,

28:03.943 --> 28:06.728
and our thoughts go out to her family
at this difficult time.

28:08.182 --> 28:12.783
And, yes, I agree
with my Honourable Friend, I agree,

28:13.927 --> 28:17.165
that the law
must take its course unimpeded.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.431
No-one is beyond its reach.

28:20.467 --> 28:22.774
I have never interfered with that,

28:22.810 --> 28:26.335
and I would never instruct
any of my staff to do so.

28:28.960 --> 28:31.152
Order! Order!

28:32.851 --> 28:35.069
What is the nature of the relationship?

28:35.322 --> 28:39.324
I met him in Bosnia 25 years ago,
when he was a translator.

28:40.650 --> 28:43.655
We were in a relationship,
and then he disappeared.

28:43.913 --> 28:45.593
He went to try and find his sister,

28:45.629 --> 28:47.702
who'd been captured by
the Serbs in Visegrad.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.400
He only reappeared
a couple of weeks back.

28:51.462 --> 28:53.835
Why did he come back to find you
after so long?

28:55.360 --> 28:56.444
I don't know.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.926
Well, that might be a question
you want ask going forward.

29:03.885 --> 29:08.390
I saw a message on his phone
from somebody called Toni Lulin,

29:08.560 --> 29:11.325
an ex-commander in the Bosnian Army
with a reputation...

29:11.360 --> 29:12.769
Yeah, I know who Lulin is.

29:13.955 --> 29:16.395
What is the nature
of their working relationship?

29:19.280 --> 29:20.578
When I met him at the hotel,

29:20.614 --> 29:22.381
it was only the second time
since his return.

29:24.509 --> 29:26.373
Did you sleep with him?

29:28.680 --> 29:29.740
Yes.

29:31.320 --> 29:35.840
Well, to be fair,
I can understand the temptation.

29:36.849 --> 29:39.254
I left my bag in his room
during the fire.

29:39.290 --> 29:41.010
- Was it returned to you?
- Mm-hm.

29:42.382 --> 29:44.147
There was nothing sensitive in it,

29:44.183 --> 29:45.755
but obviously the hotel staff
may have worked out who I am...

29:45.791 --> 29:46.791
OK.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.514
Will you please run
any checks necessary?

29:52.141 --> 29:53.845
I won't see him again
until any question...

29:53.880 --> 29:56.645
Isn't the fact that your husband
is aware of this...

29:56.680 --> 29:59.165
A factor? Yes, but not the decisive one,

29:59.200 --> 30:00.430
which is national security.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.271
And ensuring the Prime Minister
is not affected by this.

30:05.413 --> 30:08.201
OK. Well, leave this with me.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.565
The besieged Prime Minister,
Robert Sutherland,

30:17.600 --> 30:19.530
is facing fresh pressure to resign,

30:19.566 --> 30:22.451
after allegations
that members of his team of advisors

30:22.487 --> 30:25.252
may have interfered with
the police investigation

30:25.288 --> 30:28.848
into the death of Georgia Nixon,
a friend of his daughter Ellie.

30:43.742 --> 30:46.725
- What's happening?
- Don't know. We've stopped.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.365
- Where are we?
- Just near South Mimms.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.202
- Is that... Yorkshire?
- No.

30:53.587 --> 30:57.384
- It sounds like Yorkshire.
- We're in Hertfordshire, on the M1.

30:58.293 --> 31:00.844
- Fuck!
- It's 15mph, remember?

31:04.878 --> 31:06.141
Let's go have a look.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.680
- Oh, God.
- What's this all about?

31:50.554 --> 31:51.619
Dad.

31:51.863 --> 31:53.919
Sweetheart, I have an emergency COBRA...

31:53.955 --> 31:55.474
No, I really need to speak to you.

31:55.801 --> 31:57.297
- Can you give us a second?
- Afraid not.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.502
We've got a serious situation
unfolding. We need you now.

31:59.538 --> 32:02.094
Darling, I'll speak to you
in an hour, OK? One hour.

32:10.840 --> 32:15.125
Owen Harding is in a coma and will
probably never walk or talk again.

32:15.161 --> 32:17.528
This government, it's more interested

32:17.564 --> 32:20.165
in shoring up a rigged system
than talking to us.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.685
We went to see them in Downing Street,

32:22.720 --> 32:25.400
and they tried to make
us wait in the garden!

32:26.537 --> 32:29.381
Now, my union has its differences
with People's Justice,

32:29.417 --> 32:33.765
but this is a revolt
against the elite in Westminster,

32:34.220 --> 32:37.280
and our blockade, it's the only way
to make them listen.

32:37.316 --> 32:39.296
They've got the capital
totally encircled.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.777
Every way in is blocked.

32:41.240 --> 32:46.245
The transporter for the Red Zone
is stranded somewhere near St Albans

32:46.280 --> 32:48.664
- and can't move.
- You have to get it moving, Fraser.

32:48.700 --> 32:52.011
- Everything hinges on restoring power.
- Well, the problem is, it's turning...

32:52.047 --> 32:54.432
Don't bring me the problem
till you have the fucking solution.

32:55.684 --> 32:56.764
Got it.

32:58.187 --> 33:00.632
For years, you've tried
to make us invisible.

33:00.667 --> 33:02.971
For years, you've tried
to make a joke out of us.

33:03.007 --> 33:05.652
For years, you've tried
to make it like we don't exist.

33:05.688 --> 33:08.676
Well, I do.
Here we are, Mr Prime Minister

33:09.348 --> 33:11.001
Here. We. Are.

33:11.169 --> 33:14.085
Where are you?
You better be listening now.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.920
You better be listening now.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.133
No more negotiations with him.

33:26.520 --> 33:30.633
Rather looks as if the falcon is
sticking two talons up at you, Robert.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.953
We're ready for you now, Prime Minister.

34:17.077 --> 34:20.877
The situation in London
today is very grave.

34:21.659 --> 34:24.105
The capital has
effectively been encircled

34:24.440 --> 34:28.440
and our attempts to move a new
transformer to the Red Zone paralysed.

34:29.320 --> 34:34.560
Without fuel and supplies, people in
the worst affected areas will die.

34:35.679 --> 34:41.534
This is not legitimate protest,
it is an act of supreme selfishness,

34:41.844 --> 34:45.958
and no politician with the slightest
pretence at democratic credentials

34:45.994 --> 34:47.094
should support it.

34:47.998 --> 34:51.965
In the face of this assault
on democracy and the rule of law,

34:52.219 --> 34:53.645
I will not resign,

34:54.119 --> 34:58.005
and I will not call a general election,
as some are suggesting,

34:58.173 --> 35:02.142
an especially ludicrous demand,
given the current situation we face.

35:04.150 --> 35:06.173
To those who say we are not listening,

35:06.974 --> 35:11.725
I extend an invitation to sit down in
a wide-ranging national convention,

35:12.366 --> 35:14.649
to work out our differences
face-to-face,

35:14.802 --> 35:17.085
in the best interests of our country.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.805
A country that is suffering so terribly

35:20.035 --> 35:22.151
with the consequences
of a natural event.

35:23.560 --> 35:26.518
Surely, the destructive power
of the solar storm

35:26.554 --> 35:29.405
should make us reflect
on the fragility of our species

35:29.683 --> 35:33.440
and not look for opportunities
to divide and harm each other.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.922
That is all. Thank you.

35:38.400 --> 35:41.645
The Lorry Drivers' Union won't
attend without People's Justice.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.005
Which means Scott Minett.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.645
- No.
- Hold on a sec!

35:44.680 --> 35:47.595
Only a week ago he was just another
nobody shooting his mouth off.

35:47.631 --> 35:50.884
But a week is a long time
in a national emergency.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.415
And, for better or worse,
Mr Nobody speaks for a lot of people.

35:53.451 --> 35:55.333
I am not inviting that man
to Downing Street.

35:55.369 --> 35:56.372
Chequers, then.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.440
Overawe them with history
and tradition. It always works.

36:01.762 --> 36:03.614
Otherwise, there'll be no convention.

36:04.080 --> 36:08.149
We cannot use the armed forces
to break the blockade of London.

36:08.360 --> 36:12.122
The situation in the relief centres
will deteriorate very quickly.

36:12.548 --> 36:15.685
We have no choice
but to include People's Justice

36:15.720 --> 36:18.165
if we want the union leaders
to come and talk.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.480
And that means Minett.

36:22.348 --> 36:26.193
Invite Scott Minett. But make sure
Harry Rowntree feels like top dog,

36:26.367 --> 36:27.565
he's got a massive ego

36:27.600 --> 36:29.513
and he won't want some upstart
stealing his thunder.

36:29.549 --> 36:31.780
So, we get the lorry drivers
in first, give them dinner...

36:31.816 --> 36:34.141
Exactly. Invite Scott Minett
the following day,

36:34.177 --> 36:36.541
then it'll be clear who you consider
to be the organ grinder.

36:37.916 --> 36:39.801
Fine. But just Scott Minett.

36:39.837 --> 36:41.124
None of his fascist entourage,

36:41.160 --> 36:43.277
and certainly none of his fan-club
in the media.

36:45.074 --> 36:49.234
He's in the endgame now, but we need
to separate him from Anna Marshall.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.805
I think a divorce might be
just the distraction she needs.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.345
- You really are a piece of work, Archie.
- Thank you.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.595
Don't get distracted by petty revenge.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.886
She sacked Dominic Knight.

37:01.922 --> 37:05.247
Endgame is when this breaks in the
tabloids and I give him her desk.

37:05.283 --> 37:07.288
Oh, I can't really see that happening.

37:07.324 --> 37:09.849
You always had an odd affection for her.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.805
Well, it's not odd, it's very simple.

37:13.142 --> 37:15.206
She's good and she's hard-working,

37:15.459 --> 37:17.629
and those two things
count a lot with me.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.605
More importantly, though,
you can't do it.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.655
What do you mean I can't?
Has there been a coup d'etat?

37:22.691 --> 37:25.544
I should have added sensible
to good and hard-working.

37:26.048 --> 37:28.085
She did the right thing
without prevarication

37:28.120 --> 37:30.685
- and came straight to me.
- So?

37:31.072 --> 37:34.085
So, I did my homework
and put in some calls,

37:34.120 --> 37:36.600
because I, too, am good
and hard-working.

37:37.840 --> 37:42.805
Edin Tosumbegovic is connected to
a Balkan gangster called Toni Lulin,

37:42.840 --> 37:45.605
who IS involved in heroin from Turkey,

37:45.640 --> 37:47.605
and there is definitely some concern

37:47.640 --> 37:50.480
about links with returning
jihadists from Syria.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.827
So, what are we waiting for?

37:54.863 --> 37:57.151
I have reasons for letting things
play out a little,

37:57.800 --> 37:59.598
see if there's anything
to our advantage here.

37:59.634 --> 38:02.125
When she goes, he goes, or vice-versa,

38:02.160 --> 38:04.940
I really don't care
which way round it happens.

38:08.674 --> 38:11.039
- I don't understand.
- I'll only be staying there

38:11.075 --> 38:12.640
while this crisis is ongoing.

38:12.676 --> 38:15.841
Well, you've caused this crisis.
This is all on you.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.955
Fuck sake, Barney, no-one cares
about the political situation.

38:17.991 --> 38:19.203
- I do.
- OK, look...

38:19.239 --> 38:21.691
No, let's hope this is
the start of a proper revolution,

38:21.727 --> 38:23.970
so you both get put up
against the wall and shot.

38:27.520 --> 38:30.245
- Assuming that doesn't happen...
- He's just upset about...

38:30.280 --> 38:32.645
I know.
I'll go and talk to him in a sec.

38:33.005 --> 38:34.928
It is really scary, Mum.
All those lorries...

38:34.964 --> 38:38.965
It's terrifying.
And that's a big failure.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.080
People shouldn't have to live
in fear of society falling apart.

38:44.876 --> 38:46.247
What's gonna happen?

38:47.840 --> 38:49.720
- With me and Dad?
- You and Dad.

38:55.520 --> 38:56.720
I don't know.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.925
I'll stay at Maddie's for the next week,

39:06.960 --> 39:09.045
until Dad goes back to the States again.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.860
In the meantime, this is for you.

39:11.802 --> 39:13.623
Come and see me whenever you like.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.845
Everything will be all right, I promise.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.370
Your dad and I, we're still...

39:23.540 --> 39:24.820
...we're still OK.

39:29.400 --> 39:33.000
I've seen a lot of stuff about
myself online in the last week.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.400
"Silly little rich girl."

39:37.776 --> 39:40.176
How I'm protected by my privilege.

39:41.060 --> 39:46.220
How I am blaming a dead black girl
to save my own white skin.

39:49.740 --> 39:54.480
Georgia was my best friend. I loved her.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.750
And she did not deserve
what happened to her

39:58.830 --> 40:01.505
and she doesn't deserve
to be blamed for it now.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.880
And I am sorry that I've added
to the suffering of her family.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.927
I admit that it was all my fault.

40:13.560 --> 40:16.520
I was the one
that provided the drugs, and I lied.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.885
Well, this isn't exactly
going to plan, is it, Peter?

40:22.129 --> 40:23.894
I think we can weather the storm.

40:23.930 --> 40:26.845
Supply where personal gain
isn't the motive...

40:26.880 --> 40:29.525
You and Rachel knew that from the start.

40:29.560 --> 40:33.760
A cynic might think that protecting
Ellie wasn't the primary motive.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.965
Listen, I'm not here to discuss motives.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.405
I'm sure the courts
will be lenient to Ellie,

40:39.440 --> 40:42.354
especially in the light
of that touching confession.

40:42.390 --> 40:43.845
Oh, come on, Archie.

40:44.251 --> 40:45.965
Only thing to have touched you recently

40:46.000 --> 40:48.270
lives up several flights of stairs
in Jermyn Street.

40:51.440 --> 40:54.005
But will the same leniency be extended

40:54.040 --> 40:56.729
to those who encouraged her
to lie to the police?

40:56.765 --> 41:00.005
I hope not, because that would be
perverting the course of justice.

41:00.040 --> 41:03.205
Indeed. The courts are
never lenient on that one.

41:03.240 --> 41:07.205
You can get a hefty spell in chokey
just for trading speed points.

41:07.240 --> 41:08.400
And what's yours?

41:08.818 --> 41:10.861
- Point, I mean.
- My point?

41:12.400 --> 41:14.125
I suppose it's to encourage you

41:14.160 --> 41:16.764
to avoid the big bus
that's heading in your direction,

41:16.800 --> 41:19.389
because, one way or another,
someone's going under it

41:19.425 --> 41:22.044
and, slippery piece of shit
that you are,

41:22.080 --> 41:24.560
I imagine you don't want
that someone to be you.

41:25.649 --> 41:29.023
Georgia was my best friend. I loved her.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.177
She did not deserve what happened to her

41:32.213 --> 41:34.653
and she doesn't deserve
to be blamed for it now.

41:35.762 --> 41:38.727
I'm sorry that I've added
to the suffering of her family.

41:39.962 --> 41:42.207
I admit that it was all my fault.

41:42.360 --> 41:45.405
I was the one who provided
the drugs and I lied.

41:45.440 --> 41:48.622
Not because of my privilege,
but because I was scared,

41:49.040 --> 41:51.286
scared to go to prison.

41:52.120 --> 41:55.440
But I'm sorry. I am really sorry.

41:56.986 --> 42:01.551
"I promise you. I PROMISE you."

42:03.790 --> 42:06.045
Did the Prime Minister not say to you,

42:06.080 --> 42:09.505
"I promise
I will put the lights back on?"

42:09.596 --> 42:11.196
Yes!

42:12.880 --> 42:16.064
- Well, has he put the lights back on?
- No!

42:16.400 --> 42:19.685
- Has he put the lights back on?!
- No!

42:19.720 --> 42:23.765
Here in the Red Zone, we've got
no lights, we've got no warmth,

42:23.800 --> 42:25.925
and we're getting no respect.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.765
Well, you reap what you sow,
Mr Prime Minister.

42:30.137 --> 42:32.017
COs you know what we do still have?

42:32.920 --> 42:34.727
We've still got a bit of spirit.

42:36.040 --> 42:38.800
Haven't we still got a bit
of spirit to fight back?!

42:40.040 --> 42:42.325
British people, we're rising up.

42:42.654 --> 42:47.725
So, if you can't keep our streets safe,
we'll hold our own tribunals

42:47.939 --> 42:53.965
and then the looters and the rapists
and the traitors can answer to us.

42:55.560 --> 43:00.623
And you, the lads and the lasses
in uniform back there,

43:00.819 --> 43:02.624
who understands you better?

43:03.353 --> 43:06.464
Is it me, who's actually fought
for this country?

43:06.500 --> 43:07.700
Yeah!

43:08.560 --> 43:11.085
Or is it the elites down in Westminster,

43:11.120 --> 43:16.605
who laugh at people like us,
who think that flag is offensive?

43:16.640 --> 43:19.165
Well, they better turn on
their tellies now,

43:19.200 --> 43:22.925
cos we are in total control
of the Red Zone.

43:24.440 --> 43:28.805
So, I'm thinking, we pay you a visit
down in London, Mr Prime Minister.

43:28.840 --> 43:33.245
We stand side by side with
the lorry drivers at their blockade.

43:33.639 --> 43:36.446
You will not break their barricades.

43:36.482 --> 43:39.925
And to all of youse protesting,
I tell you this.

43:39.960 --> 43:41.725
Be proud of yourselves.

43:41.876 --> 43:45.245
Look them in the eyes
and tell them this.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.365
YOUR.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.485
TIME.

43:47.520 --> 43:48.965
IS UP!

43:50.760 --> 43:55.605
CCC! CCC! CCC! CCC!

43:55.640 --> 44:01.480
CCC! CCC! CCC! CCC! CCC!
