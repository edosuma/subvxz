GREAT DRAGON: In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.214 --> 00:10.344
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.428 --> 00:13.264
His name, Merlin.

00:37.997 --> 00:40.750
Your mother know you're out here?

00:41.500 --> 00:43.878
What's your name, boy?

00:47.340 --> 00:49.383
-Gilli.
-What's in the bag?

00:49.467 --> 00:50.927
Nothing.

00:52.637 --> 00:53.846
Where you headed?

00:55.890 --> 00:56.933
Camelot.

00:57.934 --> 00:59.310
To fight in the tournament.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.437
(LAUGHING)

01:02.146 --> 01:04.147
Is that what your pretty,
new sword's for?

01:04.232 --> 01:06.400
-Yeah.
-Let me see it.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.194
You ever seen this tournament?

01:09.695 --> 01:13.658
Believe me,
a little boy like you's got no chance.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.161
Especially without a sword.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.252
Give it back.

01:24.335 --> 01:27.171
I'm doing you a favor!
One day you'll thank me!

01:27.296 --> 01:30.299
| said, give it back.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.304
| thought you were a fighter?

01:35.888 --> 01:38.766
Well, here! I'll show you how to fight.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.900
Good luck at the tournament.

02:43.748 --> 02:46.751
MERLIN: Did anyone think
this tournament through?

02:46.834 --> 02:50.838
A contest open to all comers
with the prize of 100 gold coins.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.966
Hmm. I wonder what kind of people
are going to turn up?

02:54.050 --> 02:55.259
It's tradition, Merlin.

02:55.343 --> 02:58.888
The tournament's been held
every 10 years for centuries.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.182
Nothing to worry about.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.187
Tell me he can't use that
in the contest.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.439
He can use what he likes,
it's an open tournament.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.233
What about the Knight's Code?
Counts for nothing.

03:11.317 --> 03:14.445
The only rule is there are no rules.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.997
Yeah, you're right.
There's nothing to worry about.

03:49.939 --> 03:52.066
Excuse me? Hello?

03:53.150 --> 03:55.361
-Drink?
-A room.

03:55.444 --> 03:59.323
I'm only taking competitors. Spectators
have to stay outside the city walls.

03:59.407 --> 04:02.618
-But I am a competitor.
-Of course you are.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.288
Here.

04:10.126 --> 04:12.169
I'd like a room, please.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.298
-You'll have to share.
-But...

04:16.382 --> 04:18.175
Do you want a bed or not?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.513
And I'll have my money now.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.057
-Why?
-Because you'll be dead by sunset.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.650
Why, if it's not the Prince of Camelot.

05:16.734 --> 05:19.904
(LAUGHS) No, I'm his servant.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.864
I've always wanted a servant.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.411
Here. Clean them.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.372
-What?
-My boots.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.378
Hurry up.

05:49.058 --> 05:50.184
I'm looking for a cloth!

05:50.267 --> 05:52.019
| don't care if you use your tongue!
Clean 'em!

05:52.102 --> 05:53.479
Stay where you are.

05:55.773 --> 05:58.817
Oh, so you've decided
to join us after all.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.154
| think you should put that down, sir.

06:02.238 --> 06:04.114
(LAUGHING)

06:06.158 --> 06:08.786
-Did you hear that?
-Oh, I heard it all right.

06:09.954 --> 06:13.707
-Why don't you say it again?
-I'm sorry, this is my fault.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.548
I'm not hearing you.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.008
I've said what I had to say.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.308
Watch out!

06:35.104 --> 06:38.023
Now, get out.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.323
(SIGHS)

06:48.993 --> 06:50.995
Thanks for the warning.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.542
-It's me who should be grateful.
-It's all right.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.086
I've already had
a run in with those two.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.879
You have?

07:00.963 --> 07:03.007
Yeah, I know what it's like
to be picked on.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.592
ARTHUR: Merlin!

07:05.968 --> 07:08.095
-Well, thanks again. I'm...
-Merlin?

07:09.179 --> 07:12.516
-Merlin. That's me.
-I'm Gilli.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.938
-Merlin!
-Ugh, I got to go.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.114
Remind me how many times
you've won this tournament, Uther.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.200
-Three.
-That's a lot to live up to, Arthur.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.286
Indeed.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.872
| remember your last victory.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.999
You were a master in the arena.

07:38.042 --> 07:40.044
It's such a shame
we won't see you compete again.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.253
Who says you won't?

07:41.337 --> 07:43.464
| thought you said you were too old
to take the field?

07:43.547 --> 07:44.757
Not age that stops me.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.594
-I'll still prove a match for any man.
-Well, we won't be finding out.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.222
-Why ever not?
-Because I don't want you getting hurt.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.395
Do you think you could still
win the crown?

07:58.479 --> 08:01.190
The kingdom needs him to rule,
not to fight.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.484
Do you think I can't do both?

08:03.567 --> 08:05.861
Well, you're not as young as
you used to be.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.366
Besides, I need someone to keep me
company in the stands.

08:10.449 --> 08:13.494
If you'll excuse me,
| need to prepare for the tournament.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.578
Merlin?

08:18.582 --> 08:20.376
It is such a shame.

08:21.043 --> 08:24.755
It would've been good for the people
to see you compete one last time.

08:24.838 --> 08:29.093
But still, Arthur's probably right.
You can't do everything.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.140
(BELLS TOLLING)

08:47.319 --> 08:49.988
-How're you feeling?
-Confident.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.325
-You sure?
-Yes.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.496
"Cause last time this tournament
was held, three men died.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.666
-Really?
-That was just on the first day.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.710
-Thanks for that, Merlin.
-And on that second day...

09:02.793 --> 09:05.003
Let's just get through the first.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.673
You're right.
"Cause that's when most people die.

09:10.259 --> 09:11.510
-Merlin.
-Yes.

to welcome you all to Camelot.

09:46.503 --> 09:50.466
This is a contest like no other.
It is open to all comers.

(ROYAL FANFARE PLAYING)

10:06.648 --> 10:09.276
There are no rules,
no weapons are banned.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.820
The last man standing takes the prize.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.205
(ALL CHEERING)

12:35.422 --> 12:37.132
Well, who'd've believed it.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.650
That was a fine victory.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.611
-Thank you.
-That'll need treating.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.155
-That's all right.
-Gaius is the court physician.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.032
It's just a nick, I'm fine.

13:07.204 --> 13:10.248
-He's using magic.
-I suspected as much.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.751
The ring bears a mark
of the Old Religion.

13:12.834 --> 13:16.129
Such rings are very rare,
but they act as a conduit,

13:16.213 --> 13:18.215
a channel for magical powers.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.843
So he does have magic like me?

13:21.927 --> 13:23.470
He doesn't have your powers, Merlin,

13:23.553 --> 13:26.682
but as to wield a ring such as that
would need considerable gifts.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.893
Well, he's braver than me, using magic
in front of all those people.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.645
Brave or stupid.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.064
If Uther finds out,
he'll have him killed.

Sorcery.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.320
It's the only explanation.

15:03.403 --> 15:07.324
-You mustn't jump to conclusions, sire.
-What other explanation could there be?

15:07.491 --> 15:10.118
The guards report seeing a,
an unnaturally bright light,

15:10.202 --> 15:13.205
its heat so intense they could feel it
at the end of the corridor.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.832
These scorch marks would seem to
support their story.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.919
But they appear to have been there
for some time.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.546
Did the guards get
a good look at this man?

15:21.630 --> 15:24.508
-No, it was too dark.
-Unfortunate.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.510
| can see no evidence of magic.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.096
There's a strange odor.
How do you explain that?

15:29.179 --> 15:31.640
Well, it's coming from
the grain store there.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.685
It's alecost for the tavern.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.230
-They use it in their brewing.
-Brewing?

15:38.313 --> 15:41.566
Indeed, sire.
It imparts a special flavor.

15:43.527 --> 15:44.611
Very well.

15:49.574 --> 15:53.829
It's clearly Gilli, judging by
the scorch marks and the odor.

15:53.912 --> 15:58.041
There's an old healing spell.
It's crude, but it works.

15:58.125 --> 16:02.712
You heat the skin to coagulate the blood
and it cauterizes the wound.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.047
His shoulder?

16:05.257 --> 16:07.759
Well, no wonder
he didn't want any treatment.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.387
You'll have to talk to him
before it's too late.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.948
Come to see how you are.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.742
-It's a lot better.
-Can I have a look?

16:32.826 --> 16:34.411
There's nothing to see.

16:36.329 --> 16:41.001
The way you fought earlier,
that was incredible.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.503
Yeah?

16:44.588 --> 16:48.383
For someone your size to be able to
beat a man like that.

16:49.384 --> 16:53.555
I'm sure a lot of people are going to
think you're using magic.

16:57.309 --> 17:00.312
-I'm not going to tell anyone.
-I'm not using magic.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.949
You don't have to fear me.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.789
It bears the mark of the Old Religion.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.628
Where did you get it from?

17:27.464 --> 17:30.800
My father. He left it me.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.721
Did he have the same powers as you?

17:34.804 --> 17:39.059
He was a gifted man,
but he would not touch magic.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.021
He vowed never to use it. He feared it,

17:43.939 --> 17:46.650
wouldn't even let me talk about it.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.486
Why?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.489
He was scared Uther would find out,

17:53.657 --> 17:56.910
that the King would
discover he was a sorcerer.

17:57.327 --> 17:58.995
Even when he was attacked,

18:00.330 --> 18:02.999
he had three men on him,

18:03.083 --> 18:05.418
he still wouldn't use this.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.881
Is that how he died?

18:11.091 --> 18:13.718
I'm not going to be like him.

18:16.513 --> 18:19.808
Because you want to be proud of
who you are?

18:20.433 --> 18:22.435
Why all these questions?

18:22.978 --> 18:25.397
-You remind me of someone I know.
-Who?

18:30.610 --> 18:33.321
You saved my life,
and I'm trying to save yours.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.324
You need to withdraw
from the tournament.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.785
It's an open competition.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.121
You're supposed to be able to use
whatever skills you have.

18:41.204 --> 18:45.125
Fighting skills, and you're not
a swordsman, or a gladiator.

18:45.208 --> 18:48.378
Fighting is not your talent. Magic is.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.505
-Then why can't I use it?
-Because it's banned.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.216
Without magic, I'm a nobody.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.386

24:22.128 --> 24:24.047
You have to let him win.

24:27.175 --> 24:30.219
You don't have to put up
with the gloating.

24:30.845 --> 24:32.096
Do you have any idea

24:32.180 --> 24:35.642
what it's like to live with a man who
constantly thinks he's the best?

24:35.725 --> 24:39.187
Mmm. Must be irritating.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.810
-Good luck.
-And you.

25:20.061 --> 25:23.106
-You'll need it.
-Don't be so sure, Father.

25:30.488 --> 25:34.283
When I was your age,
| conquered Camelot.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.954
| didn't inherit this kingdom, I won it.

25:39.038 --> 25:43.626
One day you'll be strong enough
to take my crown, but not yet.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.596
-Ready?
-Ready.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.435
| thought you said you were ready?

26:17.577 --> 26:19.078
Need a breather, Father?

26:35.678 --> 26:38.306
Footwork. Always was your weakness.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.690
Well done.

28:10.773 --> 28:13.442
-It can't have been easy.
-If he wasn't my father...

28:16.612 --> 28:18.239
The King's through to the final.

28:18.322 --> 28:21.409
You need to worry about
who he might be facing next.

29:35.524 --> 29:38.235
| thought you said the boy
was going to withdraw?

29:39.153 --> 29:40.696
That's what I thought.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.241
-We'll have to warn the King.
-No.

29:44.325 --> 29:46.535
Why are you protecting him?

29:47.495 --> 29:48.996
You know what Uther will do.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.582
Gilli is using magic for his own gain.

29:51.666 --> 29:54.627
It's corrupting him, poisoning him.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.296
-Just let me talk to him.
- I fear it's too late.

29:57.380 --> 29:59.006
Gaius, please.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.133
You taught me what magic was for.

30:01.217 --> 30:04.095
You gave me the opportunity to be
the person that I am today.

30:04.220 --> 30:07.473
I've had you to help me.
Give me one more chance to talk to him.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.017
We'll have to put an end to this.

30:10.101 --> 30:14.397
If he fights tomorrow, either his magic
will be found out, or worse,

30:15.147 --> 30:16.774
the King will die.

30:26.075 --> 30:29.578
Now, a lot of people have asked me,
"How did he fall on his back?"

30:29.662 --> 30:33.416
| just tripped him like that. I mean,
I'm strong, you don't realize it.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.715
-What's this about?
-Your opponent.

30:42.258 --> 30:44.135
| thought you might like
to know how he is.

30:44.218 --> 30:45.386
Is he all right?

30:45.469 --> 30:47.430
Gaius thinks he'll pull through,

30:50.307 --> 30:51.851
but he might not have been so lucky.

30:51.934 --> 30:55.354
-It could've been me that got injured.
- I thought you weren't going to fight?

30:56.439 --> 30:58.733
You've seen the way people are now.

30:59.692 --> 31:01.694
They're showing me respect.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.654
And you don't know
what that's like for me.

31:03.738 --> 31:05.114
- I do.
-No.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.576
No, no one does.

31:21.964 --> 31:23.549
(INCANTING A SPELL)

31:47.198 --> 31:49.992
It's lonely.

31:54.163 --> 31:58.250
To be more powerful than any man

31:58.334 --> 32:00.878
you know and have to live like a shadow.

32:00.961 --> 32:06.092
To be special and,
and have to pretend you're a fool.

32:09.178 --> 32:12.681
| know how it feels, I understand.

32:14.892 --> 32:17.853
Then you understand why I have to fight.

32:20.564 --> 32:23.609
If Uther is killed, so what?

32:25.361 --> 32:28.197
How many of our kind
have died at his hands?

32:29.031 --> 32:30.616
How many more will?

32:32.284 --> 32:34.745
It's time those with magic fought back!

32:34.870 --> 32:38.624
-Gilli.
-You can't tell me what to do!

32:38.707 --> 32:40.417
You need to learn to use
your magic for good!

32:40.501 --> 32:43.212
That is its true purpose!
It's not meant for your own vanity!

32:43.295 --> 32:46.215
I'm not going to apologize for who I am!

32:47.216 --> 32:49.593
You can be a servant

32:49.677 --> 32:51.428
and pretend you're less than them,
but I'm not going to...

32:51.512 --> 32:54.974
-No, that's not what I do!
-No? You're defending the King!

32:56.100 --> 32:58.727
Protecting a man that
would have you dead!

32:58.811 --> 33:00.646
I'm protecting you!

33:00.729 --> 33:03.732
You've been pretending for so long now

33:03.816 --> 33:06.026
that you've actually
forgotten who you are.

33:06.777 --> 33:08.904
-That's not true.
-Isn't it?

33:09.947 --> 33:11.574
No.

33:11.699 --> 33:15.619
It's time someone struck a blow
for the likes of you and me.

33:16.787 --> 33:19.081
And if you're too weak, then I will.

33:40.811 --> 33:43.272
(SPEAKING DRAGON LANGUAGE)

34:04.418 --> 34:08.047
| was beginning to hope
you'd forgotten me.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.380
| don't think so.

34:09.465 --> 34:13.928
The problem is, young warlock,
that you wish to talk,

34:14.011 --> 34:16.388
but you don't wish to listen.

34:16.472 --> 34:20.893
The last time we met, you chose to
ignore my advice and overrule me.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.018
[, I'm so sorry.

34:22.101 --> 34:26.857
A dragonlord should
never abuse their power.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.570
What reason do you have
to summon me this time?

34:31.654 --> 34:33.697
You are a creature of magic,

34:34.989 --> 34:38.159
and only a creature of magic
could hope to understand.

34:39.161 --> 34:44.041
Uther is to fight a young sorcerer
in the tournament tomorrow.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.293
Gaius wants me to prevent him
from using magic,

34:47.378 --> 34:50.089
but if I do that,
there is every chance he will die.

34:50.172 --> 34:53.842
Your choice is a hard one,
young warlock.

34:54.426 --> 35:00.391
Yet you, like |, must hold hope
that Arthur will bring about a new age.

35:00.474 --> 35:05.104
An age where the likes of you and |
are respected once again.

35:05.187 --> 35:10.818
If he sees his father killed
through the use of magic,

35:10.901 --> 35:14.029
it will harden his mind forever.

35:14.530 --> 35:19.201
No. There, there must be some other way.

35:19.285 --> 35:23.205
To see one of your kin
die is never an easy thing,

35:23.914 --> 35:28.252
but all great struggles

35:28.335 --> 35:30.921
demand sacrifice.

35:32.256 --> 35:34.717
| am sorry, young warlock.

35:35.384 --> 35:38.637
| wish I had some words to help you.

35:39.513 --> 35:41.390
Some choices are easy,

35:43.892 --> 35:47.730
some stay with you forever.

36:06.415 --> 36:09.418
-I've come to wish you luck.
-Against a boy?

36:10.419 --> 36:14.673
-He's reached the final.
-Arthur, even you could beat him.

37:28.414 --> 37:29.456
For glory!

37:32.084 --> 37:33.502
For glory.

39:17.731 --> 39:19.942
(ALL CHEERING)

39:51.557 --> 39:52.641
I'm sorry.

40:12.578 --> 40:14.496
| didn't have a choice.

40:14.621 --> 40:18.834
You did what you had to do.
And you betrayed your kind.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.005
No, that was you.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.509
You betrayed us.

40:29.052 --> 40:33.348
You'd won, but you were going
to kill the King anyway?

40:34.808 --> 40:36.602
There's no honor in that.

40:41.356 --> 40:44.651
Come on, look inside yourself.
You're better than this.

40:45.027 --> 40:49.865
Magic is not meant for fighting.
It's not meant to bring you glory.

40:53.869 --> 40:55.746
| never understood my father.

40:57.623 --> 41:01.877
| thought that he was afraid of magic.
But he wasn't.

41:03.462 --> 41:07.716
He was afraid of what it can do,
how it can corrupt.

41:10.677 --> 41:13.263
| know now that he was, he was strong.

41:14.973 --> 41:18.060
Well, he was stronger than me.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.446
I'm sorry.

41:32.366 --> 41:35.243
Now, I know it doesn't seem like it now,

41:36.078 --> 41:39.414
but one day magic will be
permitted once again.

41:39.498 --> 41:41.291
And when that day arrives,

41:42.334 --> 41:45.629
you'll no longer have to hide who are.
Your gifts will be recognized.

41:45.712 --> 41:48.215
We, we will be free.

41:49.424 --> 41:50.592
And who knows,

41:51.760 --> 41:54.429
maybe, maybe then our paths
will cross again.

41:56.098 --> 41:58.183
- I hope so.
-Oh, they will.

41:59.393 --> 42:02.813
-We're Kin.
-Kin.

42:30.006 --> 42:33.427
-I thought the boy was going to kill me.
-MORGANA: So did |I.

42:33.510 --> 42:37.556
Then, suddenly,
the old fighting spirit kicked in.

42:37.639 --> 42:40.225
| dug deep, found my strength,

42:40.308 --> 42:43.979
and the whole thing just began to flow.

42:44.855 --> 42:46.982
| felt at one with the sword.

42:47.065 --> 42:50.986
-My feet moved instinctively.
-And now you're champion once again.

42:51.069 --> 42:53.822
And maybe you can give
Arthur some lessons.

42:55.449 --> 42:57.909
It is I who learned
a great deal from our fight.

42:57.993 --> 42:58.994
| can't see what.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.204
He's a far better warrior
than you think.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.957
It is Arthur who should've
claimed the prize.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.417
But sadly he wasn't good enough.

43:05.500 --> 43:09.171
Because he threw the fight.
That I might save face.

43:12.007 --> 43:13.049
You knew?

43:13.133 --> 43:16.428
| have followed your progress
with a sword since you were a boy.

43:17.012 --> 43:19.598
| know your abilities
better than anyone.

43:19.681 --> 43:21.892
| am eternally grateful.

43:22.017 --> 43:24.603
| hope that, when you are King
and have sons of your own,

43:24.686 --> 43:27.939
that they will afford you
the same honor.

43:30.358 --> 43:33.195
Indeed, the most satisfying outcome
of the tournament

43:33.278 --> 43:36.031
was that Arthur's actions have shown me

43:36.114 --> 43:39.075
that he is now truly ready to be King.

43:57.260 --> 43:58.970
I'm proud of you.

44:00.305 --> 44:01.723
Oh, I don't deserve it.

44:05.685 --> 44:07.354
You're being hard on yourself.

44:14.861 --> 44:15.904
All right.

44:18.073 --> 44:19.991
Er, what are you doing?

44:20.075 --> 44:22.410
-You said you didn't deserve it.
-Gaius, I haven't eaten.

44:22.494 --> 44:24.371
Pity. It's delicious.

44:27.916 --> 44:29.543
Gaius...

44:33.088 --> 44:34.422
All right.

44:40.887 --> 44:42.097
Thanks.

44:49.104 --> 44:51.314
The Cup of Life
will soon be in our hands.

44:51.398 --> 44:53.441
Its imperative that we get
to the Cup before he does.

44:56.319 --> 44:58.405
GAIUS: With such a weapon
at their disposal,

44:58.488 --> 45:00.824
Camelot would be all but lost.

45:01.783 --> 45:02.826
Elyan!

45:03.785 --> 45:05.745
Get the Cup and kill them.
