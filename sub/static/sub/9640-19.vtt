00:07.500 --> 00:08.902
Harper?
What are you doing?

00:08.969 --> 00:10.744
Why do you have your
own Career Day booth?

00:11.178 --> 00:14.253
Everyone's always telling me to be
myself, so that's what I'm doing.

00:14.288 --> 00:17.658
Are you interested in a
fascinating career in being me?

00:19.761 --> 00:21.398
I'll be you
if you be me.

00:22.502 --> 00:23.502
Never mind.

00:27.009 --> 00:29.111
Alex! Have you seen
the Action News booth?

00:29.413 --> 00:32.182
I've got to find it before someone
signs Baxter Knight as their mentor.

00:32.217 --> 00:33.986
Baxter Knight,
the weatherman?

00:34.020 --> 00:35.990
That's who you're
choosing as a mentor?

00:36.024 --> 00:37.492
He's not a weatherman.

00:37.526 --> 00:41.230
He's like a weather hero.

00:41.265 --> 00:44.101
His earmuff alerts have
saved me from many an earache.

00:44.135 --> 00:47.107
Luckily, those earmuffs have
saved you from hearing people say

00:47.141 --> 00:49.610
what a doofus you
look like with them on.

00:49.645 --> 00:52.181
I wish I was wearing
them right now.

00:55.820 --> 00:57.289
Oh! There's Baxter.

00:57.323 --> 00:58.958
So, my little friend,

00:58.992 --> 01:01.261
being a weatherman
is the only career here

01:01.295 --> 01:03.297
where you get
to be on TV.

01:03.331 --> 01:06.968
Does that sound like
something you'd like to do?

01:09.739 --> 01:11.006
Mr. Knight.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.441
I'm Justin Russo.
I'm a huge fan.

01:13.475 --> 01:16.544
I've been following you ever
since you introduced Mr. Nimbus,

01:16.578 --> 01:17.878
your cloud hand.

01:18.046 --> 01:20.915
Put on your galoshes.
It's gonna be a wet one.

01:20.949 --> 01:22.616
With the rain.

01:22.650 --> 01:27.020
You remember Mr. Nimbus.
Kid, you want a mentor?

01:27.054 --> 01:31.026
Do I have Mr. Nimbus pajamas
made out of cloud curtains?

01:32.462 --> 01:35.631
I do.

01:36.333 --> 01:37.934
Oh my gosh!

01:38.135 --> 01:41.072
There's one of the many singing
policemen who does a lot of singing

01:41.106 --> 01:42.507
at ball games and stuff.

01:45.378 --> 01:47.179
Leaving, Miss Russo?

01:47.214 --> 01:51.283
And which career counselor
have you roped in?

01:52.619 --> 01:56.455
Well, Mr. Laritate,
you know what I wish?

01:56.490 --> 01:59.625
I wish you were available
to be a mentor,

01:59.659 --> 02:02.995
because you have all the qualities
I'm looking for in a mentor.

02:03.029 --> 02:05.831
You're a "men"

02:05.865 --> 02:09.366
which is in
the word "mentor."

02:10.737 --> 02:14.107
And...

02:14.141 --> 02:15.576
...bolo tie.

02:19.948 --> 02:23.552
Nice tap dancing,
Bojangles.

02:23.586 --> 02:25.287
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

02:25.322 --> 02:26.722
I'll take you up
on that offer.

02:27.157 --> 02:29.292
Let's mosey on down to
the principal's office.

02:29.326 --> 02:31.027
Deputy.

02:31.062 --> 02:33.797
Well, suppose I was gonna end
up there at some point anyway.

03:27.788 --> 03:29.389
Dad, guess what?

03:29.423 --> 03:31.758
Someone's been putting
two pickle spears

03:31.793 --> 03:32.760
in the to-go orders.

03:32.794 --> 03:34.028
Not even close.

03:34.062 --> 03:35.629
Today was Career Day
at school...

03:35.664 --> 03:38.232
Two pickle spears?

03:38.267 --> 03:40.568
Outrageous.
This has Mom's sloppy

03:40.602 --> 03:43.038
but generous fingerprints
all over it.

03:43.072 --> 03:44.373
That's it.

03:44.407 --> 03:45.640
No more pickles.

03:45.675 --> 03:47.142
She's ruined it
for everyone.

03:51.749 --> 03:53.316
Baxter Knight!

03:53.350 --> 03:55.218
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, Justin.

03:55.352 --> 03:59.256
I had some time before
the evening news...

04:03.161 --> 04:05.095
And I wanted to come
by and tell you that

04:05.130 --> 04:08.065
- I can't be your mentor.
- Why not?

04:08.100 --> 04:09.500
You need someone
successful.

04:09.767 --> 04:11.468
I haven't nailed a
forecast in months.

04:11.502 --> 04:13.069
I've been letting
everyone down:

04:13.304 --> 04:17.541
Commuters, roofers,
people with perms.

04:17.575 --> 04:19.843
Oh, come on.
It's not that bad.

04:19.877 --> 04:22.946
If I don't get the next forecast
right they're going to fire me.

04:22.980 --> 04:25.381
Oh! Where'd you hear that?

04:25.416 --> 04:28.551
One of the weathermen sitting
in the lobby with their resumes.

04:31.755 --> 04:35.390
Look, kid, take a tip
from Mr. Nimbus.

04:35.424 --> 04:38.426
Never love anything
too much.

04:38.460 --> 04:42.096
It will eventually
disappoint you.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.533
Dad, is that true?

04:47.568 --> 04:50.236
Does everything eventually
disappoint you?

04:51.438 --> 04:53.339
Most things.

04:53.373 --> 04:58.110
But then you find the one thing
that doesn't and you marry her.

04:58.145 --> 05:00.646
And then she puts two
pickles in the to-go orders.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.114
And you...

05:02.149 --> 05:04.483
You start to wonder.

05:13.127 --> 05:15.395
You're absolutely
right, Max.

05:15.430 --> 05:17.498
Singing and the law
are very similar.

05:17.532 --> 05:19.133
You come in strong

05:19.167 --> 05:21.802
and rely on your backups
to do most of the work.

05:22.738 --> 05:24.271
Singing is just
a hobby of mine.

05:24.306 --> 05:26.440
I don't mix it
with police work.

05:26.475 --> 05:29.676
Why? But you're a great
policeman and a great singer.

05:29.711 --> 05:31.778
When you find two things
that you're great at,

05:31.813 --> 05:33.780
you got to do both.

05:33.814 --> 05:36.883
It shows you're a genius.

05:36.918 --> 05:39.086
Take a platypus
for example:

05:39.120 --> 05:41.688
Great at being a duck.
Great at being a fish.

05:41.723 --> 05:43.423
Well, it's not
that simple.

05:44.526 --> 05:48.261
You see, I'm afraid
if I mixed my singing

05:48.295 --> 05:49.696
with my police work

05:49.964 --> 05:51.932
the other guys will never
take me seriously as a cop.

05:51.966 --> 05:54.334
Yes, they will.
What's not serious about:

05:55.537 --> 05:56.937
<i>âª You have the right âª</i>

05:56.972 --> 05:58.005
<i>âª to remain âª</i>

05:58.040 --> 06:01.075
<i>âª silent âª</i>

06:09.551 --> 06:12.520
I have to hog-tie
a few loose ends.

06:12.554 --> 06:15.989
Why don't you and your
ironic mug have a seat?

06:17.358 --> 06:18.759
The place I bought it from

06:19.160 --> 06:20.761
said they'd put my picture
on it for five more bucks.

06:20.795 --> 06:22.696
You want to go
in halfsies?

06:23.964 --> 06:26.032
No, OK.

06:26.066 --> 06:30.269
Have you seen this
graffiti around school?

06:32.339 --> 06:34.307
It seems someone
keeps writing the word

06:34.341 --> 06:36.475
"salmon" under the
no smoking signs.

06:36.510 --> 06:39.712
As my new deputy these
are the sort of varmints

06:39.747 --> 06:41.381
I need your help
to wrangle in.

06:41.749 --> 06:45.151
It's not that hard. Look at
the way "salmon" is written.

06:45.186 --> 06:48.188
Remember last year when someone
wrote "Sal" on all the lunch tables?

06:48.222 --> 06:49.789
It's the same handwriting.

06:49.890 --> 06:52.525
Look, the marker smudges
mean he's left handed,

06:52.559 --> 06:54.593
drags his hand across
what he's written.

06:54.627 --> 06:57.196
Lefty Sal's your guy.

06:57.230 --> 06:58.898
There's no one
named Lefty Sal.

06:58.932 --> 07:01.834
Don't ruin my moment.
Just don't.

07:01.869 --> 07:03.302
It's the Sal
that's left handed.

07:03.337 --> 07:05.204
Amazing.

07:05.239 --> 07:07.307
I haven't seen
detective work like this

07:07.341 --> 07:09.242
<i>since Miami Vice
went off the air.</i>

07:09.276 --> 07:12.179
Now, get to work on
this caseload, Crockett.

07:14.181 --> 07:15.882
But Mr. Laritate,
I thought

07:16.417 --> 07:20.286
mentoring might be like you and me
figuring out the new school holidays.

07:20.321 --> 07:22.622
Nope.

07:22.656 --> 07:25.291
Nowadays we let the
courts decide those.

07:26.594 --> 07:29.996
By the way feel free
to call me Tubbs.

07:30.031 --> 07:31.631
Don't worry, we do.

07:31.665 --> 07:33.099
Excellent.

07:41.642 --> 07:43.175
Oh! Baxter's on.

07:44.678 --> 07:46.613
<i>Here's the deal, New Yorkians.</i>

07:46.647 --> 07:50.550
<i>Tonight, there will be
a chance of snow.</i>

07:50.584 --> 07:52.418
<i>Back to you, Doug.</i>

07:52.453 --> 07:54.587
"Chance of snow?"
No. Clear and mild.

07:54.621 --> 07:56.589
<i>"A chance of snow."</i>

07:56.623 --> 08:00.059
<i>Wow. You really put
yourself out there.</i>

08:00.093 --> 08:02.261
<i>OK. You want me to put
myself out there?</i>

08:02.295 --> 08:03.596
<i>Well. Fine.</i>

08:03.630 --> 08:06.331
Come on, clear and mild.
Clear and mild.

08:06.366 --> 08:09.301
<i>I've got nothing to lose.</i>

08:09.335 --> 08:11.903
<i>There will be snow
in exactly half the city.</i>

08:11.938 --> 08:14.306
<i>It's gonna be split
right down Waverly Place.</i>

08:15.542 --> 08:17.443
Aw. He said
our street name.

08:20.380 --> 08:22.548
<i>Now let me make a prediction.</i>

08:22.583 --> 08:25.785
<i>We'll be looking for a
new weatherman tomorrow.</i>

08:38.200 --> 08:41.302
Half of New York City?

08:44.940 --> 08:46.507
OK. OK.

08:46.541 --> 08:49.109
<i>If Baxter loses his job,
it will be a pity.</i>

08:49.144 --> 08:50.477
<i>Let's have snow</i>

08:50.512 --> 08:52.679
<i>over half of New York City.</i>

09:07.028 --> 09:09.630
Congratulations,
Deputy Russo.

09:09.664 --> 09:12.733
Thanks to you, I made quite
the round up this morning.

09:12.767 --> 09:15.369
Mayonnaise in the
soap dispensers.

09:15.403 --> 09:16.603
Clever.

09:16.738 --> 09:18.806
But not clever enough
for Crockett and Tubbs.

09:20.308 --> 09:22.776
I never knew there were kids
worse than me in school.

09:22.810 --> 09:26.313
It's fun to solve crimes and
get new ideas at the same time.

09:26.347 --> 09:28.114
Well, do you have
anything new for me?

09:28.316 --> 09:30.550
I sure do. Underwear
on the statue. Solved.

09:30.584 --> 09:32.219
Hallway of thumb tacks.
Solved.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.421
Substitute teacher
monkey. Solved.

09:34.455 --> 09:36.389
That was a hard one,
wasn't it?

09:36.424 --> 09:37.924
Not really.

09:37.959 --> 09:39.659
Once you realized
it was a wig

09:39.693 --> 09:43.763
and he was holding
the chalk with his foot.

09:43.797 --> 09:46.199
That was a really good wig.

09:47.267 --> 09:49.836
Keep up the good work, Russo.

09:49.870 --> 09:51.371
You make an excellent protÃ©gÃ©.

09:51.405 --> 09:52.538
Thank you, Mr. Laritate.

09:53.674 --> 09:55.107
Oh, yeah.

09:55.142 --> 09:56.242
Thanks, Tubbs.

10:00.914 --> 10:02.014
Uh, Harper?

10:02.049 --> 10:03.449
What are you doing?

10:03.484 --> 10:05.552
Oh. I'm just
showing my protÃ©gÃ©

10:05.686 --> 10:08.655
how to rush through halls fast,
so you don't hear the laughter.

10:08.689 --> 10:10.657
And, go.

10:13.661 --> 10:15.862
- Hey, Russo.
- Hey, Sal.

10:15.897 --> 10:19.232
Did you grow in between
P.E. and now?

10:19.266 --> 10:20.934
You're so tall.

10:21.235 --> 10:25.104
Hey. Because of you, Laritate busted
me for writing "no smoking salmon."

10:25.139 --> 10:27.039
That guy hates signs.

10:27.074 --> 10:29.341
Or salmon!

10:29.376 --> 10:33.346
No. Mr. Laritate hates
when people break the rules.

10:33.380 --> 10:37.483
I never thought I'd see the
day when Alex Russo went good.

10:43.224 --> 10:44.791
Mr. Knight?

10:44.826 --> 10:46.393
What's going on?

10:46.427 --> 10:47.962
I'll tell you
what's going on.

10:47.996 --> 10:49.363
I am back.

10:49.398 --> 10:52.267
My willy nilly predictions
have been spot on.

10:52.301 --> 10:53.935
A heat wave on
Sixty-Seventh.

10:53.970 --> 10:56.004
A blizzard on
Sixty-Eighth.

10:56.038 --> 10:58.373
No matter what I say, it
all turns out to be true.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.708
I know.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.576
I got a sun burn on the
way to my guitar lesson

11:01.611 --> 11:03.912
and a cold on the way back.

11:03.947 --> 11:05.347
Sorry, kid.

11:05.382 --> 11:06.682
I don't make the weather.

11:06.716 --> 11:07.749
I know.

11:07.784 --> 11:09.551
I do.

11:09.585 --> 11:12.487
- Let's do this.
- Look, Mr. Knight

11:12.521 --> 11:15.323
I'm happy you're getting your
weather predictions right,

11:15.357 --> 11:19.628
but don't you think you should
consult a weather satellite,

11:19.662 --> 11:21.296
or a barometer,

11:21.331 --> 11:24.066
or that temperature sign
above the bank? Something?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.701
No need, kid.

11:25.736 --> 11:28.438
I'm going with my gut.
Seems to be working.

11:28.472 --> 11:29.805
Oh, I'm on. Excuse me.

11:34.477 --> 11:37.145
Thanks, Doug.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.814
I am here on Waverly Place

11:39.849 --> 11:44.118
at the site of the historic
fifty-fifty snowstorm.

11:44.153 --> 11:50.057
Tonight, friends, brace
yourselves for, uh...

11:50.091 --> 11:51.358
...some hail.

11:51.393 --> 11:52.860
Yeah, hail.

11:52.894 --> 11:54.461
Why not?

11:54.496 --> 11:55.896
And not just any hail.

11:56.031 --> 11:58.767
It's gonna be the size
of candied yams.

11:58.801 --> 12:02.171
The size of candied yams?
Seriously?

12:05.743 --> 12:07.077
Sorry.

12:18.555 --> 12:22.257
Don't let Baxter Knight fail.
Make me some candied yam hail.

12:29.564 --> 12:33.268
What do you think you're doing,
messing with the weather?

12:33.302 --> 12:34.836
Who are you?

12:34.871 --> 12:36.572
Um? Mother Nature.

12:36.606 --> 12:39.075
Mother Nature?

12:40.778 --> 12:42.979
I thought you were supposed
to be all like natural,

12:43.014 --> 12:45.048
with sandals and birds
flying around you?

12:45.183 --> 12:48.419
I used to dress like that
but nobody took me seriously.

12:49.487 --> 12:52.756
And what I wear to work
is my business.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.524
I am here
to talk about you.

12:54.558 --> 12:56.426
Come here.

12:58.162 --> 13:01.764
Now, why would you mess
with the delicate balance

13:01.799 --> 13:03.633
of the Earth's
weather patterns?

13:03.667 --> 13:06.936
Do you know how much I work
to maintain this planet?

13:06.970 --> 13:09.338
Three days a week?
I don't know.

13:09.372 --> 13:13.108
It was my best guess.
You asked, I answered.

13:13.143 --> 13:15.711
I was trying to help my
mentor. He's a meteorologist.

13:15.745 --> 13:19.215
And what's with the hail?
How does that help anybody?

13:19.250 --> 13:22.352
Free ice!
I'm getting free ice!

13:30.162 --> 13:31.895
Mrs. Nature.

13:31.930 --> 13:33.397
Mother.

13:33.431 --> 13:36.566
- I'm really sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

13:36.601 --> 13:38.635
- About what?
- That.

13:44.642 --> 13:47.877
Be grateful. That could
have been a wildfire.

14:06.407 --> 14:09.977
One of Harper's most important
jobs is delivering news to Alex.

14:10.011 --> 14:12.045
Alex, do you know
what's going on?

14:12.080 --> 14:14.281
They put this Good Citizenship
award on your locker.

14:14.315 --> 14:17.551
A Good Citizenship award?

14:17.585 --> 14:18.886
That's low.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.155
Harper, you've got to help me.

14:21.189 --> 14:22.723
If I don't stop
being good,

14:23.191 --> 14:26.727
one day I'm gonna wake up and
be a doctor, or even worse,

14:26.761 --> 14:28.996
the guy who drives the back
end of a fire truck.

14:29.030 --> 14:31.265
Oh, you've got to help me.

14:32.567 --> 14:35.569
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

14:35.603 --> 14:37.571
I can erase your tardy sheet.

14:37.605 --> 14:39.106
Never been tardy.

14:39.374 --> 14:42.042
You know the end of every year
I buy myself an ice cream cake?

14:42.076 --> 14:43.610
It's for no tardies.

14:43.645 --> 14:46.413
You should be
taking notes.

14:47.715 --> 14:50.117
How about you take this
picture of all these horses?

14:50.151 --> 14:51.185
Oh, its a mural.

14:51.319 --> 14:53.720
It's painted right on the wall.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.867
How about you get me the key
to the teachers' bathroom?

15:02.901 --> 15:05.135
Don't write that down.

15:05.170 --> 15:08.105
Fine. I guess it's a start.

15:16.281 --> 15:17.815
Hold on a second.

15:24.823 --> 15:26.790
I don't read.

15:42.707 --> 15:43.707
Alex, don't!

15:46.878 --> 15:48.379
What do you want?

15:48.413 --> 15:51.348
Whoa, it's just
raining on you.

15:51.383 --> 15:55.419
Wow, I kind of wish I had
something to do with that.

15:55.453 --> 15:58.088
I used magic to help Baxter
with his weather predictions.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.491
Mother Nature caught me.
This is my punishment.

16:00.525 --> 16:02.059
Wait a minute.

16:02.093 --> 16:04.261
You used magic to do
something sneaky,

16:04.296 --> 16:07.598
and now you're coming to me
to help you get out of it?

16:07.632 --> 16:10.099
Feels good, doesn't it?
Except for this part right.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.600
Are you gonna help me or not?

16:15.029 --> 16:17.597
Listen, I don't know
how it happened,

16:17.632 --> 16:19.866
but I've turned good.

16:19.901 --> 16:23.036
So, you're like
a day late, buddy.

16:24.972 --> 16:27.073
Just help me, please!
I'm begging you.

16:27.108 --> 16:30.977
Fine. I'll help you.
Lean away from the window.

16:31.012 --> 16:34.915
I don't want you to get stains
on Mr. Laritate's cowhide throw.

16:34.949 --> 16:38.785
Man, the good
just doesn't stop.

16:43.624 --> 16:45.625
How did you get Mother
Nature here before?

16:45.660 --> 16:47.861
I don't know.

16:47.895 --> 16:52.299
I just messed with the
weather and she showed up.

16:55.870 --> 16:57.671
<i>What he did.</i>

17:02.109 --> 17:03.577
Sweet potato hell?

17:03.611 --> 17:05.712
Are you kidding me?
We talked about this?

17:05.846 --> 17:09.015
I can give you your own
personal earthquake, you know?

17:09.050 --> 17:11.483
Hi. You must be Mother Nature.

17:11.519 --> 17:14.854
Sorry about the hail. We just
didn't know how to contact you.

17:14.888 --> 17:18.157
Listen, Mother Nature,
love your work.

17:18.192 --> 17:19.826
Big fan of this, really.

17:19.859 --> 17:21.194
But I don't think
it's enough.

17:21.229 --> 17:22.796
Oh, really?

17:22.964 --> 17:25.799
He's sopping wet, and there's
no chance of him getting dry.

17:25.833 --> 17:27.500
Sure, he's wet.

17:27.535 --> 17:29.069
What's the best
we could hope for?

17:32.195 --> 17:35.097
I just think he needs
a more severe punishment.

17:35.132 --> 17:37.767
All right! I'm de-asking
you to help me right now!

17:37.801 --> 17:41.170
Shh. Are you packing lightning?

17:41.204 --> 17:43.539
Because I think about
thirty gazillion volts

17:43.574 --> 17:45.608
will do him just fine.

17:47.344 --> 17:48.978
Give me a sec.

17:49.012 --> 17:51.480
- Is this your sister?
- Yes.

17:52.683 --> 17:54.984
OK. I think you've
been punished enough.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.924
Now, listen guys...

18:01.959 --> 18:05.995
I may have overreacted
just a little bit,

18:06.029 --> 18:10.166
but things aren't going great
with me and I need your help.

18:10.200 --> 18:14.670
Is it the dating trouble? Because
I can really help you with that.

18:16.173 --> 18:18.808
No, Alex, she's talking
about the environment.

18:18.842 --> 18:22.578
You people need to understand
that this is a delicate system.

18:22.613 --> 18:24.413
Every time you mess
with the weather,

18:24.448 --> 18:26.649
it effects somewhere else.

18:28.018 --> 18:29.785
I think I found
your dating problem.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.421
It's just non-stop talking
about the weather, isn't it?

18:32.456 --> 18:35.324
No.

18:35.359 --> 18:37.627
What Mother Nature
is trying to say is that

18:37.661 --> 18:40.262
instead of messing with the
Earth, we should be helping it.

18:40.297 --> 18:43.933
Like recycling, or
carpooling for less pollution...

18:54.967 --> 18:57.469
We can help you
with that stuff.

18:57.503 --> 19:01.106
I don't know if you've heard,
but I recently turned good.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.312
Hey, did you see that?

19:07.346 --> 19:09.814
You stay here. I'll handle
this. This could get dangerous.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.516
Use your voice baton.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.652
It's your most
powerful weapon.

19:13.686 --> 19:18.456
<i>âª Stop I know you took
Too many papers âª</i>

19:18.491 --> 19:20.759
<i>âª You only get one âª</i>

19:20.793 --> 19:24.262
<i>âª Don't even think
About running âª</i>

19:24.297 --> 19:26.097
<i>âª You're not that cunning âª</i>

19:26.132 --> 19:27.666
<i>âª You'll never
No, never âª</i>

19:27.800 --> 19:30.835
<i>âª No, never
Get away âª</i>

19:39.845 --> 19:42.280
Officer Bryan,
you let him get away.

19:42.315 --> 19:45.383
There was no...

19:45.418 --> 19:48.353
There was nothing
I could...

19:48.387 --> 19:51.256
There was nothing
I could do.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.191
What happened
to your voice?

19:53.226 --> 19:55.527
I don't know.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.329
It must have
something to do with

19:57.496 --> 20:00.665
getting hit by this vegetable
shaped piece of hail.

20:11.099 --> 20:14.101
And I need a mentor
that can do two things.

20:14.136 --> 20:16.604
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:16.638 --> 20:19.774
I'm going to go to the zoo
and find me a platypus.

20:19.808 --> 20:22.310
That guy's a real genius.

20:28.717 --> 20:31.419
Well, there's my little deputy.

20:31.453 --> 20:33.854
Yep. People are gonna
have to get used to it.

20:33.889 --> 20:35.890
I'm just a good person.

20:35.924 --> 20:37.592
Are you?

20:37.626 --> 20:41.729
Your friend Harper, and some
seventh grader dressed just like her,

20:41.763 --> 20:44.932
were caught coming out
of the teachers' restroom.

20:44.967 --> 20:47.735
She's in a wagonload
of trouble.

20:49.471 --> 20:52.807
Great. Everyone's
in trouble but me.

20:52.841 --> 20:54.241
Wait a minute.

20:54.276 --> 20:56.143
I'm the one who
gave her the key.

20:56.178 --> 20:57.545
And that's bad.

20:57.579 --> 20:59.347
Everyone's in trouble
because of me.

20:59.381 --> 21:01.415
I am bad again!

21:01.450 --> 21:03.217
Fair enough.

21:04.987 --> 21:07.655
You'll be getting
one month detention.

21:07.689 --> 21:09.423
A month?

21:09.458 --> 21:10.992
That's not fair.

21:11.026 --> 21:13.761
Sal got a warning, and he
vandalized half the school.

21:13.795 --> 21:17.632
Maybe it doesn't seem fair, but
there's a method to all this.

21:17.666 --> 21:21.035
See, I fit the punishment
to the person not the crime.

21:27.832 --> 21:31.635
Your method is just busting me to
the full extent of your made-up laws.

21:31.669 --> 21:33.537
Oh. Alex popped her gum.

21:33.704 --> 21:38.208
Let's make her stay back a grade
or explain email to senior citizens.

21:38.242 --> 21:40.810
I understand how it may seem.

21:40.845 --> 21:42.479
But the truth is,

21:42.647 --> 21:45.348
there's nothing I can do to get
through to Sal and the others.

21:45.383 --> 21:47.784
But you, Miss Russo,
I haven't given up on.

21:47.818 --> 21:51.888
See, I believe there's evil.

21:51.923 --> 21:54.424
And there's evil genius.

21:56.661 --> 21:58.495
Really?

21:58.529 --> 21:59.996
You think I'm an evil genius?

22:00.031 --> 22:01.665
That's so sweet.

22:01.699 --> 22:06.236
Now, you'll have to turn in
your theoretical deputy's badge.

22:16.414 --> 22:19.282
That was weird
and meaningless.

22:19.317 --> 22:21.518
It was symbolic.

22:21.552 --> 22:24.920
Another one of my
methods. Now get out!

22:31.182 --> 22:33.883
Let's see how Baxter
is doing without me.

22:33.918 --> 22:35.251
<i>And in other news,</i>

22:35.286 --> 22:38.355
<i>I am sad to report</i>

22:38.389 --> 22:41.391
<i>that my colleague and dear,
dear friend Baxter Knight</i>

22:41.425 --> 22:44.060
<i>has entered into a
suggested retirement.</i>

22:44.095 --> 22:47.964
<i>If you see him and he says it
was a forced retirement...</i>

22:47.999 --> 22:49.833
<i>He's a liar.</i>

22:51.002 --> 22:53.670
He was fired.

22:53.704 --> 22:55.872
There will never be anyone
as good as Baxter Knight.

22:55.906 --> 22:58.608
And on a lighter note,
I am happy to introduce

22:58.642 --> 23:01.644
our newest weatherperson,
Heather Nakatomi.

23:01.679 --> 23:03.813
Oh, brother.

23:03.848 --> 23:06.483
Heather Nakatomi? Wow.

23:06.517 --> 23:08.818
Eh, Baxter
will be fine.
