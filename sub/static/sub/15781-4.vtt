WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.833
86:
Are you drunk?

00:02.902 --> 00:05.428
The records clearly state
that Champ is older.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.872
Older sea monster means
a hardier breeding stock!

00:07.941 --> 00:09.910
Who has ever even
heard of Champ?

00:09.976 --> 00:12.207
The Loch Ness monster
is a celebrity!

00:12.278 --> 00:14.144
He could totally
kick Champ's ass.

00:14.214 --> 00:15.045
21:
Ogopogo.

00:15.115 --> 00:15.946
HENCHMEN:
[gasp! ]

00:17.951 --> 00:19.647
21:
Champ is a picture of a log.

00:19.719 --> 00:23.156
Nessie is a toy submarine with
a head made out of plastic wood.

00:23.223 --> 00:26.057
Ogopogo is a plesiosaur --

00:26.126 --> 00:28.994
a fucking plesiosaur.

00:29.062 --> 00:30.963
- Oh, we are screwed.
- What?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.465
- Nice job.
- Who is this guy?

00:32.531 --> 00:34.467
You're gonna tell me a log,
or at best, a beaver

00:34.534 --> 00:36.366
could kick the ass
of a plesiosaur?

00:36.436 --> 00:38.302
Seriously, what is he?
Like, a cryptozoologist?

00:38.371 --> 00:39.464
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.202
Or is he Scully
and Moulder's kid?

00:42.275 --> 00:44.972
Ogo...pogo.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.843
Well, uh, of course.

00:46.913 --> 00:49.542
I mean, it's no contest.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.244
Plesiosaur!

00:51.317 --> 00:54.116
Well, uh, case closed then.

00:57.524 --> 00:59.584
What was that?

00:59.659 --> 01:02.094
That was 21.
The 21!

01:02.162 --> 01:03.858
It's not even
his number anymore.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.922
I mean, the guys is, like,
henchman 1 or something,

01:05.999 --> 01:07.695
but he won't change
his number!

01:07.767 --> 01:09.429
Why didn't you tell me
that was two-ton 21?

01:09.502 --> 01:10.970
That guy's, like,
a living legend!

01:11.037 --> 01:12.266
Man!

01:12.338 --> 01:14.273
I'm so glad I didn't mention
the car accident.

01:14.340 --> 01:15.774
Car accident?

01:15.842 --> 01:18.471
Car accident?

01:18.545 --> 01:19.740
That was no car accident.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.873
24 died
in a car intentional.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.576
What's your number, scrub?

01:23.650 --> 01:25.175
I-I-I-I'm henchman 86.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.516
You're 87 now!
Listen up, noobs!

01:27.587 --> 01:30.887
I want henchmen 87 through 95
for field duty!

01:30.957 --> 01:33.017
You got 15 minutes
to put on your makeup

01:33.093 --> 01:35.619
and fix your hair!

01:35.695 --> 01:37.186
What are you smiling about?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.788
- I have allergies.
- What? Who cares?

01:38.865 --> 01:40.925
Dude, I was henchman 87.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.662
You just got me
moved up to 86.

01:42.735 --> 01:44.328
Now I don't have
to rake leaves all week.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.669
I have allergies.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.234
MONARCH:
What are you
complaining about?

01:51.311 --> 01:53.644
21 has turned my obsessive war
with Venture

01:53.713 --> 01:56.478
into the slickest operation
in organized villainy.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.347
I know, but I'm worried
about him.

01:58.418 --> 01:59.716
Worry about me!

01:59.786 --> 02:01.687
I have an interview with
Modern Enemy Monthly,

02:01.754 --> 02:04.383
and I have this huge zit growing
on the side of my nose!

02:04.457 --> 02:05.789
You can't see it.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.350
That's because
it hasn't bloomed.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.759
God, I can feel it
pressing its way out.

02:09.829 --> 02:11.559
Oooh, it will surface.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.963
And it will be a whopper!

02:13.032 --> 02:14.660
Aside from your
pending blemish,

02:14.734 --> 02:15.827
I'm not worried about you.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.962
21 loses his
only friend and --

02:18.037 --> 02:19.061
What? Who?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.334
24!

02:20.406 --> 02:22.966
Really? Seriously?
They were inseparable.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.135
That? Oh, stop it.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.940
He's seen hundreds
of henchmen die.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.481
He's personally killed some.
He's fine.

02:28.548 --> 02:29.982
Do you even know
what he's done?

02:30.049 --> 02:31.984
Yes, built us a mud room,

02:32.051 --> 02:34.714
turned my henchmen into a crack
team of winged killers,

02:34.787 --> 02:36.779
alphabetized
my DVD collection,

02:36.856 --> 02:40.156
put little lasers
on my wrist shooters...

02:40.226 --> 02:41.626
hired this guy.

02:41.694 --> 02:44.425
Confit of duck served with a
raspberry balsamic vinaigrette

02:44.497 --> 02:46.489
on a bed of rocket
and sunchoke.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.831
See!
Rocket and sunchoke.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.427
Sweetie, do you even know
what that is?

02:50.503 --> 02:52.199
- Not a clue.
- Neither do I!

02:52.272 --> 02:53.706
And that is fancy!

02:53.773 --> 02:54.934
21 did that!

02:55.008 --> 02:56.943
I wish that was
all he was doing.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.672
No, it wasn't my pool.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.611
That's not the point.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.376
She was, like,
hanging on my shoulders,

03:02.448 --> 03:05.213
and I could feel her big chest
bumps against my back.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.516
She was totally into me --
what?

03:07.587 --> 03:09.579
No, she was a strong swimmer!

03:09.656 --> 03:12.524
I'm telling you, she wasn't
drowning she was into me!

03:12.592 --> 03:16.859
It was a one piece with a racing
stripe down the side.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.331
That's ridiculous!

03:19.399 --> 03:21.300
Why would that mean
she was sloppy!

03:21.367 --> 03:22.630
Didn't have
a detachable skirt.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.034
It was a regular
bathing suit.

03:24.103 --> 03:25.662
Please! That's it?

03:25.738 --> 03:27.536
Come on, I still talk
to my friend's corpse.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.473
That's a stuffed cat!
It's different.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.704
I mean, it's about as creepy,
but it's different.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.542
Mr. Mostly Mittens
was my best friend!

03:33.613 --> 03:35.707
That cat could fetch
a rubber band!

03:35.782 --> 03:37.580
He'd bring it back every time!

03:37.650 --> 03:39.209
It's the same kinda thing,
it's just --

03:39.285 --> 03:41.117
what are you doing?

03:41.187 --> 03:42.985
They didn't have
dinner yet.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.389
If you feed them table scraps,
they'll just keep doing it!

03:45.458 --> 03:47.893
Get out!
Now! Go!

03:47.961 --> 03:50.089
All right, Sam.
Relax.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.155
It's all good.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.996
I'm more concerned about those
rotten little things

03:54.067 --> 03:55.160
than I am henchman 21.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.069
I'm just worried he's gonna
do something crazy.

03:58.137 --> 03:59.867
He's a model hench--

03:59.939 --> 04:02.067
Man, oh man!

04:02.141 --> 04:05.339
Rocket and sunchoke
tastes like burning soap!

04:05.411 --> 04:06.709
The training is complete.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.179
The timing is right.

04:08.248 --> 04:12.015
It's time I let you in
on "The Lazarus Project."

04:12.085 --> 04:14.520
No, does it sound like I was gonna
bring you back from the dead?

04:14.587 --> 04:15.987
Okay, whatever.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.613
I just thought
it sounded cool.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.283
I also have
"Avenging Angels,"

04:19.358 --> 04:21.190
"Dragon Thunder Undertaking,"

04:21.261 --> 04:23.696
and, my second choice:
"Eye for an I."

04:23.763 --> 04:25.857
The second "eye" is
the letter I.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.867
It's pretty cool.
I also have a logo for it.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.130
Sweet, I like that one, too.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.195
I have a list
of your possible murderers.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.264
We shall apprehend,
interrogate,

04:34.340 --> 04:37.868
and if need be,
execute each suspect.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.776
I am totally being serious.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.872
"An Eye for an I"
begins tonight!

04:41.948 --> 04:43.041
And it begins...

04:43.116 --> 04:45.551
with the Venture family.

04:51.557 --> 04:52.991
Snap!

04:53.059 --> 04:54.027
That was your neck, Hank.

04:54.093 --> 04:55.288
I just broke your neck.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.829
Now I'm gonna
take your skin off

04:56.896 --> 04:58.728
and wear it
to the ding dong prom!

04:58.798 --> 04:59.822
I knew it was you.

04:59.899 --> 05:01.094
What is going on?

05:01.167 --> 05:03.159
Well, good morning,
Mr. Sleepy Kill Me!

05:03.236 --> 05:05.467
I just murdered your brother
and had enough time

05:05.538 --> 05:07.473
to rip his leg off
and beat you with it.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.839
You boys gotta
get with the program!

05:09.909 --> 05:11.207
I knew it was you!

05:11.277 --> 05:14.145
And you were so lucky I did,
because I was about to--

05:14.213 --> 05:15.681
That is horse poop!

05:15.748 --> 05:19.185
Look, I don't wanna fake
dismember you boys every night,

05:19.252 --> 05:21.812
but you have to realize
that you are just...

05:21.888 --> 05:24.357
more fragile than you're
accustomed to.

05:24.424 --> 05:25.323
All right, fine.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.860
But in the future, could you
warn us before you do that?

05:27.927 --> 05:31.159
In the future, the lazy eloi
will be living above ground.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.825
But underground,
there will be cave monsters

05:33.900 --> 05:36.495
that use the above ground people
for food.

05:36.569 --> 05:38.561
Dean, they eat them.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.630
Now I know what happened to my
copy of The Time Machine.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.335
See, I didn't take it!

05:42.408 --> 05:43.842
I expect an apology.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.208
And also, I want a dollar.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.371
Emotional damage.

05:46.446 --> 05:47.744
This is ridiculous.

05:47.814 --> 05:48.804
I'm going back to sleep!

05:48.881 --> 05:50.406
Yes, it is!

05:50.483 --> 05:52.952
It's ridiculous that you two
can't hit the panic room button

05:53.019 --> 05:55.250
when someone
tries to kill you!

05:55.321 --> 05:57.722
Brock never had problems
protecting us.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.157
Low blow, Hank.

06:00.226 --> 06:01.353
Umm, Dean?

06:01.427 --> 06:02.395
What?

06:02.462 --> 06:06.058
Which book comes after
Mystery of the Burning Island?

06:06.132 --> 06:07.225
Giant Boy Detective

06:07.300 --> 06:09.064
and the Secret of
the Disappearing Pyramid.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.967
Okay, I'm, uh...

06:11.037 --> 06:12.335
I'm just gonna borrow that.

06:12.405 --> 06:15.170
DR. GIRLFRIEND:
And this little piggy went
"wee wee wee"

06:15.241 --> 06:16.402
all the way home.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.308
Wait, another little piggy.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.108
What does this piggy do?

06:20.179 --> 06:21.807
MONARCH:
Hardly a little piggy.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.043
Well, he already did
all his shopping.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.609
So there is no need
for him to go to market.

06:26.686 --> 06:29.087
And there's no way
he's gonna go "wee wee wee--

06:29.155 --> 06:30.919
I didn't think you'd let me
do that the first time.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.583
I'm not gonna push it.

06:32.658 --> 06:36.390
Well, what if I find
a nice place for the piggy?

06:36.462 --> 06:38.556
I have some ideas.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.691
Ugh.
Honey, your face!

06:40.767 --> 06:43.100
Sweety -- ugh!
It's disgusting!

06:43.169 --> 06:44.364
That bad?

06:44.437 --> 06:46.565
I told you that zit
was ready to bloom.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.574
I'm gonna go hit this
with some tweezers.

06:48.641 --> 06:49.870
Don't get dressed!

06:49.942 --> 06:51.877
If that's a zit,
I'm gonna call Guiness.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.537
That's a world record.

06:53.613 --> 06:54.546
This is something way worse.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.015
Aaah! Motherfucker!

06:57.083 --> 06:58.312
What is that?

07:01.087 --> 07:02.521
Eat it!
Too fast for ya.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.123
One is mint in box.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.717
The other is out of stock.
Over.

07:07.794 --> 07:10.229
Copy that.
I'll handle it. Over.

07:10.296 --> 07:12.424
Dean. Dean?

07:12.498 --> 07:13.693
Hey, dude!
Sleep heavy enough?

07:16.202 --> 07:18.068
Aaahh!
Oh, gross!

07:18.137 --> 07:19.127
The kid's packing wood.

07:19.205 --> 07:20.969
Copy.
Do you require backup? Over.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.236
No, no, not that kind
of "packing wood." Seriously.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.301
And trust me, nobody else
needs to see this.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.745
It's rank.

07:27.814 --> 07:29.578
Ugh.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.049
Grim.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.313
All right, let's move.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.116
[ clatter! ]

07:38.191 --> 07:41.559
Ow! Goddamn coffee table!
Motherfucker!

07:41.627 --> 07:43.095
Come on, let me see!

07:43.162 --> 07:45.256
My face is massive!
I'm a freak!

07:45.331 --> 07:47.994
[laughs ]
Can I come in
if I have a ticket?

07:48.067 --> 07:49.899
I promise not to bang
on your cage.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.665
Yes, please make light
of this.

07:51.737 --> 07:52.568
It's helping.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.539
I feel much better about
my hideous deformity.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.735
Should we change our
costume theme, sweetie?

07:56.809 --> 07:58.243
Maybe you could be Glob Face,

07:58.311 --> 08:00.337
and I could be Lady Glob Face.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.406
Maybe we'll get a Globmobile
and Globbo the Wonder Dog.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.315
Why are you not helping me?

08:05.384 --> 08:07.012
Well, what do you
want me to do?

08:07.086 --> 08:09.578
Clearly, you're allergic
to whatever rocket is.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.783
Or whatever sunchoke is.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.622
Maybe a fortress of
Globitude?

08:13.693 --> 08:15.093
[sighs ]

08:15.161 --> 08:17.130
I'm going back
in the bathroom.

08:17.196 --> 08:18.425
Get up!

08:18.498 --> 08:19.693
Emergency!

08:19.765 --> 08:20.960
Our home has been violated!

08:21.033 --> 08:22.797
What time is it?

08:22.869 --> 08:23.893
Go time!

08:23.970 --> 08:27.134
I was downstairs sitting in front
of the computer masturbating,

08:27.206 --> 08:28.139
and then zip!

08:28.207 --> 08:29.800
This is sticking
out of my neck,

08:29.876 --> 08:31.845
my clothes are gone,
and the boys are missing!

08:31.911 --> 08:32.970
Oh my God!

08:33.044 --> 08:35.207
Don't you worry!
We'll get 'em back.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.715
I mean, oh my God,
you just told me

08:36.782 --> 08:39.217
you were masturbating
in front of the computer.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.480
Oh, what --
and you don't?

08:40.553 --> 08:42.818
Well, yeah.
But I'm not proud of it.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.120
Look, you can talk about
your needless shame later.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.989
We have to rescue your sons!

08:47.059 --> 08:48.823
Fine.

08:48.895 --> 08:50.955
Well, that's a Monarch dart,
so we...

08:51.030 --> 08:51.895
get them or
something?

08:51.964 --> 08:53.262
Not so simple.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.324
Look, I was in the Guild of
Calamitous Intent.

08:55.401 --> 08:58.132
And I'm also a recovered
pedophile.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.866
So if anyone
knows the rules

08:59.939 --> 09:01.965
about abducting young boys
from their bed,

09:02.041 --> 09:03.839
it's old Sgt. Hatred.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.742
Why did I let you
take this job?

09:05.811 --> 09:07.279
Because I'm great!

09:07.346 --> 09:10.180
Plus I had no job, no home,
and refused to leave yours.

09:10.249 --> 09:11.842
And not the point!

09:11.918 --> 09:16.083
This abduction malarkey is
completely against Guild law.

09:16.155 --> 09:19.853
So we're gonna handle this one
the Hatred way.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.758
Take some
antihistamines!

09:21.827 --> 09:23.557
I don't have a little
tickle in my chest,

09:23.629 --> 09:24.927
I look like John Merrick!

09:24.997 --> 09:27.193
I need, like, a cortisone
injection or something, duh!

09:27.266 --> 09:29.167
I don't know,
I'm not a doctor!

09:29.235 --> 09:30.066
[ phone rings ]

09:30.136 --> 09:30.967
Oh, you're not?

09:31.037 --> 09:33.438
Then why the fuck have I been
calling you "Dr. Girlfriend," huh?

09:33.506 --> 09:34.804
I'm not that kind
of a doctor.

09:34.874 --> 09:36.467
Hold on,
I'm gonna get that.

09:36.542 --> 09:37.703
Monarch residence.

09:37.777 --> 09:39.370
Ahem, yeah. Hi.

09:39.445 --> 09:40.970
This is Sgt. Hatred.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.448
I used to live next door, but
now I'm kinda your arch enemy?

09:43.516 --> 09:44.745
Yeah?

09:44.817 --> 09:47.412
Yeah, well, it seems you
illegally took the Venture boys.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.978
So, you're gonna have
to hand 'em over,

09:50.056 --> 09:52.525
or I'll come over to your house
and blow it up.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.221
And I guess I'll probably have
to kill the both of you, too.

09:55.294 --> 09:57.058
- Hold on.
- Okay.

09:57.129 --> 09:59.121
So, you like the briefs?

09:59.198 --> 10:01.565
I find them a tad too tight
on my little battalion.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.694
Sweetie, I have
to take this call!

10:03.769 --> 10:04.964
Who is it?

10:05.037 --> 10:06.061
Is it Modern Enemy Monthly?

10:06.138 --> 10:07.470
Uh, yeah.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.509
And they wanna
do a blurb on me.

10:09.575 --> 10:11.168
This always happens!

10:11.243 --> 10:13.269
Next thing you know,
it's you naked on the cover!

10:13.346 --> 10:15.144
I knew it!

10:15.214 --> 10:16.182
All right, fine.

10:16.248 --> 10:17.648
But when you talk about me,

10:17.717 --> 10:20.744
constantly use the words,
"genius" and "visionary."

10:20.820 --> 10:23.187
So, Giant Boy Detective
just puts Elizabeth

10:23.255 --> 10:26.555
on his huge head and walks
right across that lake.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.858
You see, the little waif
leads them to the island --

10:29.929 --> 10:31.397
Hup, she's back on the horn.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.659
I'll tell you the rest later.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.428
Listen, I can assure you

10:34.500 --> 10:36.401
that the Monarch and I
did not take them.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.098
Well, I can ass-sure you,
little Miss So-and-so,

10:39.171 --> 10:40.969
that somebody there did.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.668
And if you don't
help us get 'em back,

10:42.742 --> 10:44.472
I can ass-sure you

10:44.543 --> 10:46.774
that the Guild will have
your collective heads!

10:46.846 --> 10:48.371
Okay, I'll take care
of this.

10:48.447 --> 10:50.006
Wrong!
We'll take care of this.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.813
Doc and I are gonna be
at your door in one hour!

10:52.885 --> 10:54.319
Not the door!

10:54.387 --> 10:57.289
I'll meet you
at the old observatory.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:11.237 --> 11:12.899
Looks like the set
of The Gilmore Girls.

11:12.972 --> 11:14.497
Looks can be deceiving.

11:14.573 --> 11:16.769
Ever wonder where villains
get their mail sent?

11:16.842 --> 11:18.811
It ain't to their
hollowed out volcano!

11:18.878 --> 11:21.438
It's right here -- Malice.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.574
Yeah, that would be more
impressive if I hadn't been here,

11:23.649 --> 11:26.278
like 50 times, and usually
to rescue the boys.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.083
We just have to stop at my old
place and pick up some gear.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.123
Never know what kinda --

11:32.158 --> 11:33.683
Uh, problem?

11:33.759 --> 11:35.785
You're gonna have to turn
your vehicle around.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.955
This is
a gated community.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.693
Yeah, I'm a pretty
little flower.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.530
Like a prom date, maybe?

11:42.601 --> 11:43.796
This is a gated community.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.805
Enjoy the silence.
Are you for supper?

11:46.872 --> 11:47.965
Gated... Gated...

11:48.040 --> 11:48.939
Turtles!

11:49.008 --> 11:52.809
Now let's go dream about little
breaded chicken fingers.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.210
Ha! Robots!

11:54.280 --> 11:56.772
Programmed to respond to over
700 different questions.

11:56.849 --> 11:59.318
None of which
includes chicken fingers.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.013
Hey, souvenir!

12:01.087 --> 12:02.555
You can use 'em
like halloween masks.

12:02.621 --> 12:07.150
Maybe Dean can go as a middle-aged
security guard this year, huh?

12:07.226 --> 12:09.218
What is going on?

12:09.295 --> 12:11.628
You have been driven insane!

12:11.697 --> 12:14.326
You have been subjected to the
dreaded Chinese water torture

12:14.400 --> 12:16.494
for easily a half an hour.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.003
You have lost your grip
on reality.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.368
We're delirious?

12:19.438 --> 12:21.498
So, this is a dream,

12:21.574 --> 12:22.667
and we're
not really here--

12:22.742 --> 12:24.108
Oh, no, you're actually here.

12:24.176 --> 12:27.408
But if I'm half monster, and
like half goat and half hor--

12:27.480 --> 12:28.846
that's stupid.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.610
Okay, if my bottom half
is a horse,

12:30.683 --> 12:32.413
and on top I'm Sin-Eater.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.509
Who's Sin-Eater?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.350
Or Wolverine!
With bat wings.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.684
Dude, you're that
henchman guy.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.884
- With bat wings?
- No, that is mental!

12:38.958 --> 12:40.392
You're regular.

12:40.459 --> 12:41.688
Are you sure
you did this right?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.354
Because I'm not
really tortured.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.091
Just kinda wet.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.224
The real torture is
that farty smell.

12:47.299 --> 12:48.699
Did you put something
in the water?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.031
The water's clean.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.832
But those are totally
the buckets we used

12:51.904 --> 12:53.566
to mop up
the level 4 bathroom.

12:56.308 --> 12:57.708
Hi, honey.

12:57.777 --> 12:58.870
What happened?
Did you leave?

12:58.944 --> 13:02.005
Yeah, the magazine wanted to do
a quick photo shoot.

13:02.081 --> 13:04.710
At night.
At the old observatory.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.810
That was supposed
to be my photo shoot!

13:06.886 --> 13:08.878
Wait! What do you have on
under your robe?

13:08.954 --> 13:10.047
Clothing?

13:10.122 --> 13:12.751
Not good enough!
Let's see it.

13:12.825 --> 13:13.815
Knew it!

13:13.893 --> 13:14.952
It's not what
you think, sweetie!

13:15.027 --> 13:16.723
Oh, yeah, it's just
what I think.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.765
Well, I'm gonna go
to the cocoon

13:18.831 --> 13:20.424
and maybe go arching
without you.

13:20.499 --> 13:21.626
You like that idea?

13:21.700 --> 13:22.793
That's a horrible idea.

13:22.868 --> 13:24.734
Seriously, baby,
don't go to the cocoon.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.636
Why? I haven't been there
in, like, forever.

13:26.705 --> 13:27.900
What are you
hiding from me?

13:27.973 --> 13:29.737
Sweetie, please
don't go--

13:29.809 --> 13:31.937
We'll handle
the Monarch, mum.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.071
He won't be going
anywhere.

13:34.146 --> 13:37.310
Tim-Tom, I mean just keep him
busy so he doesn't leave.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.817
Don't go all crazy.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.284
He'll flip if he knows
what's going on.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.651
All right, hold on a second.
I have another call.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.815
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.654
I didn't get cut off.
I hung up on you.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.591
- Oh, I know.
- Why didn't you call me back?

13:48.661 --> 13:49.924
I thought you'd just
hang up--

13:49.995 --> 13:51.554
DOC:
Are we gonna get your gear,
or what?

13:51.630 --> 13:54.327
HATRED:
I can't go in there.
My ex is in there.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.800
Okay, then let's go.

13:55.868 --> 13:58.099
Honestly, what gear do we need
- an H-shaped grapple gun?

13:58.170 --> 14:00.969
Oh, will you look at
that sweet squaw.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.100
She is just sitting there
missing me.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.940
What a woman she is -- what?
Who's he?

14:06.011 --> 14:07.104
There's a guy in there?
Let me see!

14:07.179 --> 14:09.205
- Who is that other guy?
- I can't tell.

14:09.281 --> 14:11.079
Everyone looks the same
in a leather mask.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.948
Okay, I recognize the one
with the ball gag.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.418
That's Private Schwa.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.648
I can't look!
Tell me what's going on!

14:16.722 --> 14:18.748
Okay, the big guy
with the saddle on his back

14:18.824 --> 14:19.792
is just driving his--

14:19.859 --> 14:22.522
Aah! Lie to me!
Damn you, lie to me!

14:22.595 --> 14:24.086
Fine, just relax.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.756
Okay, I think they're
rehearsing for a play.

14:25.831 --> 14:29.962
Is there a non-musical, mostly
nude version of Oklahoma!?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.800
Hello.
Where is you going?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.204
For a walk.
What's it to you?

14:34.273 --> 14:35.741
You aren't going
anywhere.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.174
I wouldn't even try to move--

14:37.243 --> 14:38.905
Aah aah!
Don't finish that sentence.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.209
I'm only gonna
say this once.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.612
I don't like you two.

14:42.681 --> 14:46.641
And if you ever, ever try
to give me an order again,

14:46.719 --> 14:48.312
I will kill you both,

14:48.387 --> 14:50.515
and feed your
tiny rotting bodies

14:50.589 --> 14:52.558
to the neighborhood dogs.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.321
Now, what were you saying?

14:54.393 --> 14:55.986
Have a nice walk?

14:56.061 --> 14:56.892
How about you?

14:56.962 --> 14:58.396
Do I have to get a can of Raid
and spray you?

14:58.464 --> 15:00.524
I didn't say nothing.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.227
Anything?

15:02.301 --> 15:03.564
Nope. Still sane.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.229
Okay.

15:05.304 --> 15:06.670
Well, just tell me when
you're driven so crazy

15:06.739 --> 15:08.571
with the water torture
that you wanna confess.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.734
To what?!

15:09.808 --> 15:11.743
Okay, I don't wanna sound
like a know-it-all, but--

15:11.810 --> 15:13.904
It's a little too late
for that, Deano.

15:13.979 --> 15:16.005
Aw, Smack!
I was just gonna say that!

15:16.081 --> 15:17.606
Har-dee-har.

15:17.683 --> 15:18.514
Pwned!

15:18.584 --> 15:20.553
This is unprovoked torture
and kidnapping.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.417
It's completely
against Guild procedure.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.252
The Monarch could get
in big trouble for this.

15:24.323 --> 15:25.757
Do you see the Monarch around?

15:25.824 --> 15:26.689
I don't.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.752
Dean, this is about me, and the
murder of my best friend.

15:29.828 --> 15:30.852
Your friend was murdered?

15:30.930 --> 15:31.761
Duh!

15:31.830 --> 15:33.628
You don't remember a car
blowing up in your yard,

15:33.699 --> 15:35.691
killing my only friend?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.066
Oh, wasn't that the same day

15:37.136 --> 15:38.900
that 100 gooey copies
of me and my brother

15:38.971 --> 15:41.634
were mowed down by a lunatic
in a spinning laser suit?

15:41.707 --> 15:45.337
And the day that my best friend
Brock left us forever?

15:45.411 --> 15:48.347
How could we forget one of,
like, a million guys

15:48.414 --> 15:50.212
who died on my lawn?

15:50.282 --> 15:52.217
Yeah, and that happened
a pretty long time ago.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.219
Why are you
doing this now?

15:54.286 --> 15:56.949
After that happened,
I was devastated.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.821
I buried most of what
I could find of 24.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.691
And with him,
I buried my dreams.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.389
HENCHMAN:
Company!

16:04.463 --> 16:05.692
Fire!

16:05.764 --> 16:06.993
Fire!

16:07.066 --> 16:08.398
21:
I couldn't go on
being a henchman.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.459
Nothing made sense
with 24 gone.

16:10.536 --> 16:13.734
So I went back to my life
before I was 21.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.865
I went back to being --

16:14.940 --> 16:15.771
GARY'S MOM:
Gary!

16:15.841 --> 16:16.672
What?

16:16.742 --> 16:18.176
Keep it down in there!

16:18.243 --> 16:20.269
Mom, I'm podcasting
my life story!

16:20.346 --> 16:21.780
This is important.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.611
GARY'S MOM:
Well, be important quietly!

16:23.682 --> 16:25.207
Okay! Fine!

16:25.284 --> 16:26.479
Geesh.

16:26.552 --> 16:29.317
"This was no ordinary eighth
grade Washington trip.

16:29.388 --> 16:31.414
This was the day that
I was to be stolen

16:31.490 --> 16:32.685
into the life of a hench--"

16:32.758 --> 16:34.818
- Gary!
- Mom!

16:34.893 --> 16:36.452
But there was
nothing for me there.

16:36.528 --> 16:39.327
I knew my purpose was to make
24's death mean something.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.663
I knew that I had to become
not only a henchman,

16:41.734 --> 16:43.430
but a leader of henchmen.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.336
I trained myself
in the mystic arts.

16:46.405 --> 16:47.338
Lightning bolt!

16:47.406 --> 16:48.999
Lightning bolt! Lightning bolt!

16:49.074 --> 16:51.066
21:
And in the fighting arts.

16:51.143 --> 16:52.111
Hey, that's not --
[grunts ]

16:54.480 --> 16:57.575
21:
My body became a muscled
killing machine.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.140
HANK:
Well... don't go crazy.

16:59.218 --> 17:00.379
21:
Oh, you should have
seen it before.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.080
I did,
like a million times.

17:02.154 --> 17:03.349
Anyway, Hank.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.448
I was ready to rejoin
my old unit.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.428
And under my tutelage,

17:12.498 --> 17:14.262
that unit became
the most feared henchmen

17:14.333 --> 17:16.131
ever to don the wings.

17:16.201 --> 17:19.660
I vowed never again will we lose
a man to my cowardice.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.763
Oh, yeah.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.172
I did it.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.972
It was me.
I killed 24.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.809
We all did, Gary.
We all did.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.405
Don't blame me, I didn't!

17:29.481 --> 17:31.040
And you seriously
gotta untie me

17:31.116 --> 17:33.142
or you're gonna have
to scratch my heinie.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.881
Because my heinie
totally itches.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.224
Bar's closed.

17:45.297 --> 17:46.822
Gonna have
to ask you to leave.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.527
Excuse me, you insolent
soon-to-be-corpse...

17:48.600 --> 17:50.159
Did you just
refuse me a drink?

17:50.235 --> 17:51.601
No serving past midnight.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.036
General 21's orders.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.006
General 21?
General?!

17:55.074 --> 17:56.474
Do you know who
you are speaking to?

17:56.542 --> 17:57.976
All right, let's go, pal.

17:58.043 --> 17:59.136
I asked nice.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.703
I don't care if you whisper it into
my ear and give me a corsage,

18:01.780 --> 18:03.373
I am not leaving

18:03.449 --> 18:06.009
till I get my Fresca.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.149
Whhyyyy!

18:09.221 --> 18:11.656
Why would let them
do that to you?

18:11.723 --> 18:14.318
Wait a minute -- I asked you
to do that position.

18:14.393 --> 18:16.453
Apparently I didn't ask you

18:16.528 --> 18:19.054
while wearing buttless
leather chaps!

18:19.131 --> 18:20.531
[thunder crashes ]

18:22.634 --> 18:27.698
Oh, what would
Giant Boy Detective do?

18:30.542 --> 18:32.909
What the --
Why are you here?

18:32.978 --> 18:34.173
Where were you?

18:34.246 --> 18:36.238
The tree fort back there.
Who are you?

18:36.315 --> 18:38.011
Go home.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.483
Now.

18:39.551 --> 18:40.519
I don't need this.

18:40.586 --> 18:42.521
Man, what's wrong
with your face?

18:42.588 --> 18:43.521
What's wrong with yours?

18:43.589 --> 18:44.887
Henry, that's rude.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.255
Clearly he's deformed.

18:46.325 --> 18:47.918
Probably the kindly
old groundskeeper.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.757
Yeah.
Kindly old groundskeeper.

18:49.828 --> 18:51.421
I was once young and handsome

18:51.497 --> 18:53.022
and then a witch cast
a spell on me.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.225
Well, sorry.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.323
So do you want Dean
to kiss you?

18:55.400 --> 18:56.925
He's a princess!

18:57.002 --> 18:59.528
No!
I want you to go home.

18:59.605 --> 19:00.470
Okay. Where are we?

19:00.539 --> 19:02.371
The magical land of Narnia.

19:02.441 --> 19:03.704
I'll call you a cab.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.801
And the telescope
is really a laser.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.346
Never seen it fired.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.347
I did.
I was like four, maybe five.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.178
Super loud.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.912
Probably the reason
I have tinnitus.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.317
Yeah, that was
in one of the episodes

19:14.386 --> 19:15.615
of the Rusty Venture show.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.849
So you're a fan.
Figured.

19:17.923 --> 19:18.982
And here we are.

19:19.057 --> 19:19.956
Alone.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.049
What would
the neighbors think?

19:21.126 --> 19:23.186
The neighbors are
Auntimatter,

19:23.262 --> 19:25.254
who's a spinster that
shape shifts,

19:25.330 --> 19:27.629
and Flying Squid, he's pretty
self-explanatory.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.725
So I don't think
they'd find this weird.

19:29.801 --> 19:32.293
I have a magic guy
living in my house.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.738
Oh, and my former arch enemy
is now my bodyguard.

19:34.806 --> 19:37.139
So, looks like
we made it.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.701
Exactly what my parents
wanted for me.

19:39.778 --> 19:40.905
Guaranteed.

19:40.979 --> 19:43.847
Yeah, my father
would be proud.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.282
So you haven't
seen the boys?

19:45.350 --> 19:48.252
No.
Did you try calling them?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.652
Aww!

19:49.721 --> 19:51.713
Hatred, what an idiot.

19:51.790 --> 19:55.318
No, he never --
World's worst bodyguard.

19:55.394 --> 19:56.589
What's up, pop?

19:56.662 --> 19:57.789
Where are you?

19:57.863 --> 19:58.728
In bed.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.425
Really?
Where were you tonight?

20:00.499 --> 20:01.865
We were in Gary's tree fort.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.800
We took a cab home
like an hour ago.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.200
[ knocking ]

20:10.275 --> 20:11.800
What's the password?

20:11.877 --> 20:13.277
I forgot.

20:13.345 --> 20:14.369
Oh, wait, I remember.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.881
I'm the fucking Monarch!
Let me in, now!

20:16.949 --> 20:18.315
It's open.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.045
What the hell
are you doing?

20:20.118 --> 20:22.053
It's the Chinese
water torture.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.850
It's not really torture.

20:23.922 --> 20:26.118
It's like, uh, napping under
an air conditioner, kinda.

20:26.191 --> 20:27.557
Whoa!

20:27.626 --> 20:29.060
You know, I think the water
torture has given me

20:29.127 --> 20:30.652
second sight,
or something.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.664
I can see your true,
evil self.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.165
It has been revealed.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.201
Hardly.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.168
It's an allergic reaction
to a fancy salad.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.135
Oh.

20:38.203 --> 20:39.899
So, uh, why are you not
with Dr. Girlfriend?

20:39.972 --> 20:42.840
She's taking her clothes off
for my interview.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.536
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

20:44.610 --> 20:45.634
Your wife naked?

20:45.711 --> 20:46.542
No!

20:46.612 --> 20:48.240
I mean, she's pretty,
but no, that's --

20:48.313 --> 20:50.475
Yeah, phase out the Monarch

20:50.549 --> 20:51.812
so you can
take his place, huh?

20:51.883 --> 20:53.476
- What?
- I'm onto you!

20:53.552 --> 20:55.077
I know you had
the Venture brothers here.

20:55.153 --> 20:56.246
Who told you that?

20:56.321 --> 20:57.550
Nobody.
I can smell them.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.990
Hank wears more Stetson cologne
than a gigolo,

21:00.058 --> 21:01.720
and Dean smells
like Selsun Blue.

21:01.793 --> 21:03.318
So, uh, what?

21:03.395 --> 21:04.829
Are you torturing them
without me?

21:04.896 --> 21:06.558
Hardly. I blew it.

21:06.632 --> 21:08.123
I tried to get them
to confess to a murder

21:08.200 --> 21:09.725
that I think I committed.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.599
[sigh ]
I'm not you.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.229
I don't have
that natural hate.

21:13.305 --> 21:14.329
You were born for this.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.238
You don't know
the half of it.

21:16.308 --> 21:18.402
I hate everything.
Seriously.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.173
I hate myself
more than most villains

21:20.245 --> 21:21.406
hate
their arch enemies.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.005
I'm all hate.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.071
No, it's true.

21:24.149 --> 21:27.677
And I am honored to serve
in your ranks, sir.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.016
- Really?
- Totally.

21:29.087 --> 21:30.783
Oh, hey, you wanna hang out?

21:30.856 --> 21:33.724
We can play cards, or watch
Josie and the Pussycats.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.818
Slo-mo the Rosario Dawson
scenes.

21:35.894 --> 21:38.261
Like when 24 was still here.

21:38.330 --> 21:39.730
Old times?

21:39.798 --> 21:42.700
This is very touching,
so here's what I'll do.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.862
Instead of having you executed
for suspected treason,

21:44.936 --> 21:47.132
I'll leave you to play
in your tree fort

21:47.205 --> 21:50.869
before I burn it down, okay?

21:50.942 --> 21:52.774
See, total pro!

21:52.844 --> 21:55.109
You are the mighty Monarch!

21:55.180 --> 21:58.582
Don't ever forget that.

22:29.047 --> 22:30.982
Dude, guess who did a spread

22:31.049 --> 22:32.677
for Modern Enemy Monthly?

22:32.751 --> 22:34.879
Ta-da!

22:34.953 --> 22:36.979
Dude, where are you?

22:37.055 --> 22:40.184
What are you doing
over there?
