00:08.801 --> 00:11.678
The CDC doctors are...

00:11.845 --> 00:13.846
...anxious.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.476
They're concerned
about the disappearance.

00:18.644 --> 00:21.312
Do they have anything
to be concerned about?

00:23.107 --> 00:25.566
What's done is done.

00:25.734 --> 00:29.987
Isaac and Soren
have completed their paths.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.698
Good.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.908
And Michael?

00:35.035 --> 00:37.203
He blames Anne.

00:38.664 --> 00:43.584
He's afraid she's losing control.

00:43.752 --> 00:47.255
My mother's control is an illusion.

00:47.423 --> 00:51.092
One we must keep providing for her.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.468
Of course.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.930
What if she finds out...

00:58.058 --> 00:59.100
...about us.

01:01.311 --> 01:04.355
There is no us, Landry.

01:04.523 --> 01:07.775
I've told you many, many times.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.697
I misspoke. Forgive me.

01:17.411 --> 01:21.372
I think one of the scientists
has taken a liking to me.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.876
The cute one. Kyle?

01:25.043 --> 01:29.422
It seems the CDC
is becoming a distraction for us all.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.966
We can't have that.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.387
No.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.014
No distractions.

01:38.182 --> 01:42.226
It would be terrible
if something unexpected...

01:42.394 --> 01:44.061
...were to happen to them.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.607
Say it, Landry.

01:49.485 --> 01:51.110
Say it.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.034
Something unexpected.

01:58.202 --> 01:59.994
A terrible....

02:08.962 --> 02:12.882
I'd say it's about time
we took matters into our own hands...

02:16.053 --> 02:17.678
...wouldn't you?

02:57.553 --> 03:00.137
Saw a mess of deer tracks
near the creek banks.

03:00.305 --> 03:03.933
They were moving at a pretty good clip.
Something's got them spooked.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.686
Feel free to turn up the radio.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.855
Oh, right, we don't have one.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.024
Jaye likes it when I sing.
Don't you, Jaye?

03:12.192 --> 03:15.069
It has a certain resonance
that reminds me of singing.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.706
Father, someone's coming.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.302
Inside.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.139
Both of you.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.668
Michael.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.506
Where is Soren?

04:17.674 --> 04:18.799
Soren is gone?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.135
The boy, yeah. He's missing.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.764
From your care?
I thought you had him under quarantine.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.518
We need a coordinated search
of the grounds.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.563
-I don't have the manpower for that.
-Done.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.568
Do you know
what I love about plant grafting?

04:37.736 --> 04:39.236
The precision...

04:39.404 --> 04:41.030
...the attention to detail.

04:41.198 --> 04:45.076
If the angles of the cuts
don't line up just right, the plant fails.

04:45.577 --> 04:50.164
Not enough humidity,
and the scion won't flower.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.499
But with practice?

04:52.167 --> 04:54.710
Plums on peach trees.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.797
Tomatoes grow in the snow.

04:59.841 --> 05:03.010
If only it were so easy with people.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.930
Unfortunately
the results are far less reliable...

05:06.098 --> 05:08.516
...once you add free will into the mix.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.644
I didn't come here for Botany 101.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.271
Well, then, anything else?

05:14.439 --> 05:16.732
No. That's all for now.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.861
But if I find out
you're behind Soren's disappearance...

05:21.029 --> 05:23.364
...I will hold you both responsible.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.750
Are we?

05:34.918 --> 05:36.711
Absolutely not.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.879
The boy was placed in their care.

05:39.047 --> 05:42.842
Alone, without the balance
of our family to reassure him.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.679
They wrapped him in plastic.
I wouldn't blame him for running off.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.306
We haven't been
seeing eye to eye lately.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.642
Unfamiliar territory for us, no?

05:51.810 --> 05:54.520
My only thought
is of what we have here.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.732
-And how to protect it.
-That's what I want too.

05:57.899 --> 06:02.319
Sometimes though, it helps
to have fresh eyes on the situation...

06:02.487 --> 06:04.447
-...don't you think?
-Of course, but--

06:04.614 --> 06:09.994
I think we should just call this
a difference of opinion.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.292
Sweet Anne.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.964
I don't know what I'd do without you.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.466
Testing to isolate and identify
the pathogen continues.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.385
Specimen A is a patient
with no known toxic exposure.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.472
Adult male, 32 years old,
approximately 175 pounds.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.973
More like 160.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.142
Been watching the carbs.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.562
Additional ELISAs were used
to test for known toxins...

07:18.730 --> 07:21.440
...against the samples
from the St. Germain subject.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.902
Juvenile male,
10 years old, approximately 95 pounds.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.280
Both during the symptomatic window
and after remission...

07:28.448 --> 07:31.158
...samples failed to yield a result.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.578
This is like emptying the ocean
with a teaspoon.

07:34.746 --> 07:38.374
It could take weeks to make
an identification without an ICP-MS.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.708
l-C-what?

07:40.669 --> 07:43.212
Inductively-coupled
plasma mass spectrometry.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.214
Why didn't you say so, Hot Zone?

07:45.382 --> 07:47.049
Please don't call me that.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.926
Let's try something different.

07:49.094 --> 07:52.304
Soren exhibited the same symptoms
as the ship victims, right?

07:52.472 --> 07:56.016
Ulcerating sores, scleral icterus.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.562
That's yellow eyes
for those of you playing at home.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.523
What if we match Soren's samples
to the ship victims?

08:04.693 --> 08:06.610
-That way--
-That way we can use...

08:06.778 --> 08:10.156
...competitive binding and find a match.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.658
It might actually work.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.870
-Okay. Where are the ship samples?
-Right here.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.420
Wait a minute. Where are they?

08:27.257 --> 08:28.924
-What's wrong?
-They're not here.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.759
-What's not here?
-The samples.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.053
Where did you last see them?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.599
In the shack.
When we found Leila's body.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.809
They must have fallen out.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.854
You're kidding, right?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.902
Those samples were everything.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.279
We can't confirm
the pathogen without them.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.822
I'll fix it.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.744
-What happened?
-Boy Wonder left the samples...

08:56.912 --> 08:59.413
-...at the shack.
-I'll get them back.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.874
Hold on. We'll go.
Sarah, grab a field pack.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.709
No. This is on me. I should go.

09:03.877 --> 09:07.379
I need you here.
You've developed a rapport with Amy.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.507
-That's one way of putting it.
-Okay, use it.

09:10.675 --> 09:14.386
Find out if Soren was acting strangely
before he attacked his mother.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.972
Narrow down the symptomatic window.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.726
Let's see
if you can find our missing kid.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.311
Hey.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.553
I knew they would send someone.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.348
I did not think it would be you.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.405
It's not what you think.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.700
A lot has changed
since we last saw each other, Father.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.453
Not as much as I would have hoped.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.913
Ilaria's gone. I was wrong to trust them.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.582
I know that now.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.500
You and I...

11:09.586 --> 11:12.463
...we're on the same side.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.093
The immortals have scattered
to the winds. Our time is over.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.512
The TXM-7 pandemic is destroying us.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.058
I just want to save the few
who are left.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.102
Tell me why I should believe you.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.646
Because I'm here.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.982
Unarmed.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.946
Believe what you want.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.008
Hurry up with those barrels.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.719
-We've got lots of work to do.
-That's good work.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.605
Everything okay, Jerome?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.942
Yeah. Fine. Why?

12:15.902 --> 12:18.654
You've raked the same spot
three times now.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.909
I was just thinking how much I miss
having a drink every once in a while.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.869
That's your past life talking.

12:26.037 --> 12:29.873
Don't worry, there's no alcohol
on the island. Michael forbids it.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.127
What's with the wine barrels then?

12:33.294 --> 12:36.755
No idea. Except it's not wine.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.674
What then?

12:38.842 --> 12:40.926
Better not to ask.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.344
As Michael says:

12:42.512 --> 12:45.639
"Embrace your own path,
not your neighbor's."

13:03.741 --> 13:05.993
Amy, hey...

13:06.161 --> 13:09.288
...about yesterday.
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.332
How can an idea be wrong?

13:12.500 --> 13:15.878
There's no substance to it. Just air.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.047
If I hurt your feelings,
it wasn't my intention.

13:24.095 --> 13:27.264
That's what skeptics
don't understand about us.

13:27.932 --> 13:32.728
We're free to explore our actions
or reactions without blame or fear.

13:33.354 --> 13:37.524
Our actions to others, others to us.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.360
We don't limit our bodies
or our thoughts.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.780
We use the space we've created here
to explore the darkness...

13:43.948 --> 13:46.158
...test it, and find the light.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.744
What if all you find is more darkness?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.413
That's just another discovery.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.499
Is it like that for the children?

13:53.666 --> 13:57.252
Of course.
The children are the most free.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.714
I'm sorry you haven't found the answers
you're looking for yet.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.300
I usually find them one way or another.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.220
Still...

14:06.429 --> 14:08.472
...it must be difficult for you.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.723
Not really.

14:09.891 --> 14:14.144
You see, the CDC is real good
at exploring the darkness.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.605
We have very bright flashlights.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.484
Right now I'd like to turn that light
on your children.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.412
What's your name, sweetheart?

14:35.833 --> 14:39.002
Elizabeth.
But everybody calls me Lizzie.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.255
Did you know Soren, Lizzie?

14:44.592 --> 14:46.260
He was in my class.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.512
But not anymore.

14:48.680 --> 14:53.141
That day, before he went away,
was he acting kind of strange?

14:54.561 --> 14:55.727
He said he was scared.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.105
Soren's feeling much better now,
Lizzie.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.357
We talked about that.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.736
Okay, Lizzie. This won't hurt a bit.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.407
Can you open your mouth for me?
Like this?

15:10.994 --> 15:13.287
Maybe not quite like that.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.252
What was Soren scared about?

15:21.963 --> 15:25.632
-I can't say. If Amy finds out....
-She won't. I promise.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.891
He said he broke a rule.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.810
He didn't want to go in the pit.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.605
What rule? What's the pit?

15:44.235 --> 15:46.695
That should do it. Take care now.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.698
Next?

15:55.913 --> 15:59.082
Keep moving. We don't want to be
out here longer than we have to.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.377
Seemed like a better idea
inside the giant, electrified gates.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.297
The sooner we get to the shack,
the sooner we get back.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.216
You know, I'm not so sure
it's that much safer inside.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.135
-Alan said that--
-Damn it, Sarah.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.055
You tried to talk sense into him.
He told you to run.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.599
-He's manipulating you.
-He knows something...

16:15.767 --> 16:19.269
-...about what's going on.
-What's going on is a CDC investigation.

16:19.437 --> 16:22.272
-Alan's no longer a part of that.
-Why shouldn't he be?

16:22.440 --> 16:26.193
-We should bring him on.
-You still think he's going to save the day.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.779
I don't need saving, Peter.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.989
I'm a scientist,
and I use my resources.

16:31.157 --> 16:34.785
One of our best is wasting his time
picking apples and raking leaves.

16:34.952 --> 16:38.038
You have no idea what he's up to,
neither do I.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.915
And that's a good thing.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.709
How can you say that?
He's your brother.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.504
He killed people, Sarah.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.341
In Paris.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.886
After Arctic Biosystems,
he became obsessed.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.931
He couldn't think of anything but Julia.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.892
-I've heard the rumors.
-It's more than rumors.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.977
Interpol has security-cam footage...

17:01.145 --> 17:03.855
...of him leaving
Ilaria's corporate headquarters...

17:04.023 --> 17:05.691
...just before a bomb went off.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.235
Maybe he thought
he was creating a diversion.

17:08.403 --> 17:11.488
Maybe he didn't expect people
to be there.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.324
But they were.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.951
Innocent people.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.744
Immortals?

17:17.912 --> 17:20.497
Immortals. Just like you.

17:22.208 --> 17:26.837
Alan's not the man he used to be.
And it's time we all face that.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.437
Lock it.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.820
I wouldn't get too close.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.951
What is that?

17:59.036 --> 18:00.912
Seraphim's Breath.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.125
The Mayans used it in human sacrifice.

18:05.293 --> 18:10.255
One whiff and people would literally
cut their own throats.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.217
Funny, isn't it?

18:15.261 --> 18:17.304
Nature gives us free will.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.806
Then it gives us
the ability to take it away.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.933
Michael and Anne know about this?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.518
Of course not.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.646
They're afraid of anything
they can't control.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.402
Maybe they should be
a little more afraid of me?

18:34.489 --> 18:36.406
What do I do with this?

18:56.344 --> 18:57.385
Children?

18:58.095 --> 19:00.472
Children. Gather around.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.895
Who wants to play a game?

19:07.063 --> 19:09.606
-I do.
-What's it called?

19:09.774 --> 19:11.733
"Time Machine."

19:20.326 --> 19:22.452
-Who wants to go first?
-Me.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.871
Okay. Lizzie.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.465
Just breathe, Lizzie.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.231
Who wants to go next?

19:51.399 --> 19:53.066
Me.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.296
Leila's body's gone.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.049
You don't suppose somebody came
from the Abbey to pick it up...

20:18.217 --> 20:21.052
...and never get around to telling us,
do you?

20:22.013 --> 20:24.639
Somebody definitely came to get it.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.975
And I don't think it was anyone
from the Abbey.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.978
I found the samples.

20:30.146 --> 20:33.148
The competitive-binding idea
that Kyle had was really inspired.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.859
Yeah, well, hopefully,
it will give us some clues.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.283
Hey, come on.

20:45.453 --> 20:50.123
Open the door.
I can smell you right now.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.128
Get the samples.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.677
Come on. The window.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.893
Open the door.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.686
Go, go, go.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.040
Fresh meat!

21:48.891 --> 21:51.351
Come on, come on.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.577
She can't be trusted.
You know that, right?

22:09.745 --> 22:14.249
She's my daughter.
A part of me is happy to see her.

22:14.417 --> 22:18.169
And the other part?
She betrayed us once.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.338
Much time has passed.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.717
You don't see clearly
where she's concerned. You never have.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.969
I know what she is.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.637
I made her that way.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.806
You know what you have to do.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.059
I don't need a lecture from you.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.604
-I will discover her true intentions.
-Then what?

22:37.273 --> 22:41.609
Then I will do what is necessary.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.172
I'm glad you've finally
found some peace.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.758
Last time we saw each other,
that wasn't the case.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.428
Finding peace is very difficult.

23:09.263 --> 23:10.930
Especially for our kind.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.975
You've been on this island a long time.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.978
There isn't much peace
to be had these days.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.897
For anyone.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.525
Then I'm lucky to pass my days here.

23:22.693 --> 23:25.612
You still find immortality lucky.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.615
Why else would I have given it to you?

23:29.533 --> 23:31.993
I sometimes wish you hadn't.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.537
It doesn't matter.

23:35.289 --> 23:36.664
You are here now.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.383
You drugged me.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.908
Why is Soren's blood sugar so high?

24:13.536 --> 24:17.122
-Dr. Kyle.
-Lizzie. What's wrong?

24:17.289 --> 24:21.918
Come quick. The children are sick.
Please, hurry.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.592
Well, where are the children?

24:35.683 --> 24:37.183
Lizzie?

24:41.272 --> 24:44.649
Lizzie? What's wrong?

24:47.528 --> 24:49.445
Hey, kids, what's up?

24:57.246 --> 24:58.955
What are you guys doing out here?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.878
Can I help you with something?

25:48.464 --> 25:51.966
-Yeah. I was told to bring these here.
-By who?

25:54.303 --> 25:55.762
This isn't produce storage?

25:55.930 --> 25:58.848
You want the red building.
It's the other side of the orchard.

26:02.353 --> 26:05.438
I'm new to the picking crew.
I thought they said here.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.065
Well, they were wrong.

26:21.497 --> 26:25.708
You told us there were bears out there,
not people.

26:26.502 --> 26:29.587
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.
Whatever you think you saw--

26:29.755 --> 26:32.715
Don't tell me you don't know
what's going on on your island.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.343
-Peter.
-It's Dr. Farragut.

26:36.762 --> 26:40.306
I'm only trying to tell you
that there are no creatures outside.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.100
It wasn't a creature. It was a man.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.937
A very sick man who was exhibiting
Stage 2 symptoms of the pathogen...

26:46.105 --> 26:47.563
...along with necrotic lesions.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.023
It's like ergot poisoning...

26:49.191 --> 26:53.403
...a fungal toxin that produces psychosis,
along with severe physical symptoms.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.406
How could you not tell us
there are people in the woods?

27:03.664 --> 27:06.708
Well, some people choose
to leave the Abbey.

27:07.209 --> 27:10.962
They come because they're tired
of living dishonest lives.

27:11.130 --> 27:16.426
But if they reject their true path,
often there's nowhere for them to return.

27:16.593 --> 27:20.179
So you just throw them out
to fend for themselves?

27:20.347 --> 27:22.390
No one is thrown out.

27:22.558 --> 27:25.601
I only help them see
that they are their decisions.

27:25.769 --> 27:29.063
Once made,
they have to live with them.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.316
Or die by them?

27:32.067 --> 27:33.609
If that's their path.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.581
Based on what we saw,
the pathogen is outside the gates.

27:46.749 --> 27:50.168
-Question is, where did it come from?
-You're assuming it started outside.

27:50.336 --> 27:53.004
-How's that?
-What if it was the other way around?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.048
You think the source
is inside the Abbey?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.508
They're doing some heavy-duty
botanical work here.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.302
Hybrid breeding, seed manipulation.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.263
They're combining traits of plants
to create new variants.

28:02.431 --> 28:04.349
Like GMOs?
They don't have the technology.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.310
They don't need it.
Grafting has been around for centuries.

28:07.478 --> 28:10.938
Gregor Mendel was crossbreeding
pea plants in the 1850s.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.107
At an abbey not unlike this one.

28:18.072 --> 28:20.698
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, Jesus.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.117
-Kyle. Kyle, can you hear me?
-Kyle.

28:23.285 --> 28:26.412
We need to get him on his back.
Come on, buddy.

28:28.457 --> 28:29.916
Airway clear. Breathing normal.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.460
-There's so much blood.
-We gotta find the source.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.840
Here. Hey.

28:38.634 --> 28:39.842
Kyle, come on, buddy.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.804
-"Sunshine Day."
-Kyle, it's Peter.

28:44.681 --> 28:45.890
What happened?

28:46.058 --> 28:48.267
-How long have I been out?
-I don't know.

28:52.189 --> 28:55.108
-My head is killing me.
-You got a nasty laceration.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.737
Hey. Payback's a bitch.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.907
-Who did this to you?
-Oh, you wouldn't believe it if I told you.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.450
Hell, I don't believe it.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.454
-The kids.
-The kids?

29:08.622 --> 29:10.456
All of them, acting together.

29:10.624 --> 29:13.126
They left me for dead,
and I dragged myself back here.

29:13.293 --> 29:16.504
I've seen angry mobs before.
This was something else.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.548
They were blank.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.426
-Like a trance?
-Maybe some kind of brainwashing.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.761
Cults are notorious
for mind-control techniques.

29:23.929 --> 29:27.098
Their eyes.
The pupils were darting side to side...

29:27.266 --> 29:29.100
...quick repetitive movements.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.727
Nystagmus,
an involuntary nerve condition.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.063
-Where are the kids now?
-Don't know. Why?

29:34.231 --> 29:36.566
I'd like to see them for myself.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.460
Good. You're awake.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.300
My arm.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.343
What--? What is--?

30:04.511 --> 30:07.138
It's Sodium Pentothal.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.056
What?

30:10.184 --> 30:11.893
Why?

30:13.562 --> 30:15.855
You should have told me the truth.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.617
Julia.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.913
Tell me, why are you here?

30:32.706 --> 30:35.625
-A cure.
-For what?

30:35.792 --> 30:38.377
Immortals dying.

30:39.755 --> 30:42.256
That's not possible.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.551
I'm dying.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.012
Julia.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.694
Julia.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.781
Tell me who you work for.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.661
Julia.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.329
Who do you work for?

31:14.206 --> 31:15.331
Ilaria.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.480
They seem fine.

31:52.202 --> 31:54.203
Dr. Kyle.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.002
What happened? Did you get hurt?

32:13.181 --> 32:14.515
One minute they attack me...

32:14.683 --> 32:16.809
...and the next
they wanna kick a ball around?

32:16.977 --> 32:19.812
Soren experienced a similar recovery
from the pathogen.

32:19.980 --> 32:23.566
-I'm telling you, this was different.
-What could have caused that attack?

32:23.734 --> 32:27.820
I don't know, but I'd lay odds
somebody wants us off this island.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.989
-Permanently.
-Right there.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.866
There it is.

32:32.034 --> 32:35.620
-You get something?
-Lower left quadrant at 400X.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.290
It's definitely a fungus,
but not one I've ever seen before.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.168
Which means that we have no idea
what it's capable of.

32:44.046 --> 32:45.796
We need to bring Alan in on this.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.424
No, no. No, we talked about this.

32:48.592 --> 32:52.303
-Alan Farragut?
-He's handled hundreds of investigations.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.388
He's here?

32:54.556 --> 32:56.641
-On the island?
-He's here.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.185
Pretending to be one of the followers.

32:59.353 --> 33:01.729
The last thing we need
is another variable.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.607
-And Alan is just that.
-We need all the help we can get.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.150
Not his kind of help.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.945
We've got limited time to get a handle
on this, or a lot more people will die.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.906
With Alan, at least we have a chance.

33:15.285 --> 33:19.830
Okay. But let me talk to him first. Alone.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.100
-My eyes!
-What is it?

34:21.268 --> 34:22.810
My eyes! Someone help me!

34:22.978 --> 34:24.770
-My eyes!
-What's happening, brother?

34:25.272 --> 34:29.567
Help me! It's burning!
Get me some water! Help me!

34:29.735 --> 34:31.152
Calm down, brother.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.987
What is it?

34:39.202 --> 34:42.246
I told you, I will do what is necessary.

34:43.457 --> 34:45.833
You need to trust me
to do what is right.

34:46.001 --> 34:48.043
The decision is mine.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.379
Stay out of sight.

34:50.547 --> 34:53.007
I will decide what to do.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.094
-Daniel, don't be so dramatic.
-You know I'm right.

34:57.262 --> 35:00.389
-What are you waiting for?
-It's more complicated than that.

35:00.557 --> 35:04.435
You said you'd do what you had to do.
It's time.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.355
I do not want to discuss this now.

35:08.523 --> 35:11.108
Go ahead. Tell him.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.944
Tell me what?

35:14.613 --> 35:17.531
You're choosing her? Again?

35:17.699 --> 35:20.034
Bringing you here is proof enough.

35:21.161 --> 35:24.455
-You are my son.
-And she is our daughter.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.666
We can make her understand.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.128
She's a strong woman, but she'd burn
down the house to clean the stove.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.964
We can make her see
there's another way.

35:34.549 --> 35:37.301
Don't do this, Hiroshi.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.178
She doesn't belong here.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.643
Dan--

37:41.176 --> 37:43.844
I thought you'd never wake up.

37:44.429 --> 37:47.348
What is this? Where are my clothes?

37:47.515 --> 37:50.142
You look very pretty.

37:51.353 --> 37:53.187
Are you ready?

37:55.690 --> 37:57.066
You were right to come to me.

37:57.859 --> 38:02.363
I can save you.
But first, meet your family.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.074
What family? There's no one here.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.702
Say hello to your mother and brother.
