CRAB.
ANY TIME YOU TAKE A BIG WAVE,

15:29.094 --> 15:41.105

18:10.222 --> 18:26.704
TO REPLACE IT.
>> THAT'S NOT SEPARATING WATER
FROM THE FUEL.

18:26.839 --> 18:33.177
>> AIN'T DOING THE JOB.
EVEN WHEN WE POURED WATER
[BLEEP] IT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY

18:33.312 --> 18:41.519
SEPARATE THAT FROM THE FUEL.

DRIP.

18:41.653 --> 18:47.492

FROM THE BOAT.
>> Narrator: THE POWERFUL
CURRENTS PUSH THE BUOY SET UP

23:48.260 --> 23:55.666
UNDER THE HULL.
NOW THE CAPTAIN'S PROBLEM IS
WHETHER OR NOT HIS LINES MADE IT

23:55.801 --> 23:58.836
PAST THE STERN.

THE BOAT.

23:58.971 --> 24:13.417

>> THEY'RE BOTH GOING DOWN?
>> YEAH.
>> WHEN WE SAID IT WAS CLEAR, WE

26:31.723 --> 26:39.797
WEREN'T CLEAR.
>> PRETTY SURE IT WAS CLEAR.
I DON'T KNOW.

26:39.932 --> 26:47.004
>> GOT THE RUDDER, SAID WE
WEREN'T CLEAR, SET A SECOND ONE,
EXPECTING THAT TO WRAP ON THE

26:47.139 --> 26:54.679
FIRST ONE.
>> Narrator: LAUNCHING A STRING
IN A STORM, RAN OVER AND THE

26:54.813 --> 27:03.020
PROPELLER SNAGGED IT.
THEN IT CAUGHT HOLD OF THE FIRST
ONE, NOW DRAGGING 2000 POUND

27:03.155 --> 27:08.559
ANCHORS AND LINE, THE CAPTAIN
AND CREW ARE IN A BIND.
>> IF THIS STUFF COMES LOOSE AND

27:08.694 --> 27:16.467
THERE'S A COUPLE BIG LOOPS, GETS
WRAPPED IN THE WHEEL.
COULD BE IN A 40, 50 MILE BLOW,

27:16.601 --> 27:25.376
AND PUTTING THE BOAT ADRIFT WITH
THE CREW TO STAY ON IT.
>> THAT'S STUCK IN THE WHEELS.

27:34.519 --> 27:39.323
>> Narrator: HE IS NOT TAKING A
CHANCE OF MORE SNAGS.
>> IF I PUT IT FORWARD AND GO,

27:39.458 --> 27:44.729
THAT WILL HANG.
IF I HAVE TO MANEUVER AND PUT IT
IN REVERSE AND IT WRAPS AROUND

27:44.863 --> 28:04.749
THE SHAFT, IT CAN BIND US UP,
SHUT US DOWN.
>> THIS IS SECURE BACK HERE.

28:04.883 --> 28:11.889
>> THE FORECAST IS NOTHING BUT
40s AND 50s THE NEXT FIVE DAYS.
I CAN'T RISK THIS.
