00:31.614 --> 00:34.034
<i>♪ And it's sort of okay! ♪</i>

00:34.117 --> 00:35.618
Excuse me, Kimmy Lee and Hoda...

00:35.702 --> 00:37.245
first pun of the day, don't judge...

00:37.328 --> 00:39.831
I was not prepped for this level of pep,
Peppy Le Pew.

00:39.914 --> 00:40.832
Puns getting better.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.167
Sorry not sorry, Titus,

00:42.250 --> 00:43.644
but I need these tunes to get pumped

00:43.668 --> 00:45.920
for the old nine to five a.m.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.007

00:51.134 --> 00:52.969
What is this nunsense you're singing?

00:53.052 --> 00:55.805
It's from <i>Now That Sounds Like Music!</i>

00:55.889 --> 00:57.557
Titus, the tapes came!

00:57.640 --> 01:01.144
"Music Inspired By, But Legally Different
From, the Music You Love."

01:02.145 --> 01:04.522
<i>♪ And doughnuts taste good ♪</i>

01:04.605 --> 01:07.859
This is "Hiking on Sunlight"
by Kartuna and the Wigs.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.822
Come on.
Dance like you have ants in your pants.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.113
I do have ants in my pants
due to some pocket taffy.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.323
But I will not.

01:14.657 --> 01:15.492
What?

01:15.575 --> 01:17.160
Don't tell me you still have the blues.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.120
No, I switched flavors of Gatorade.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.623
Now it comes out... Oh.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.083
Yes, I have been feeling a bit low.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.811
Quitting Professor Dracula's
was supposed to lead

01:25.835 --> 01:28.671
to something great,
but so far, no one's offered me

01:28.755 --> 01:30.715
any amazing jobs in this apartment.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.467
Well, why don't you go see Mikey?

01:32.550 --> 01:35.470
Mikey's away at ConCon,
the annual construction convention.

01:35.553 --> 01:38.306
He's dressing as his favorite
silicone joint sealant.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.724
It's Permatex.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.434
Well, I know what always cheers me up:

01:41.518 --> 01:43.728
singing in the shower!

01:48.191 --> 01:49.359
What the huh?

01:49.442 --> 01:51.069
Last night, after a box of key lime wine

01:51.152 --> 01:53.071
and some shame spiraling,

01:53.154 --> 01:55.198
I decided to give all my Barbies perms.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.881
Some of them don't have the face for it.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.201
But I need a shower.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.744
I can't miss the morning rush.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.038
That's when people
are most desperate for rides.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.916
Hungover prep school kids,
fishmongers who overslept,

02:04.999 --> 02:06.960
girls leaving John Mayer's houseboat.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.919
No, they have to dry in place

02:09.002 --> 02:10.856
before I can apply
the Japanese straightening goop!

02:10.880 --> 02:12.590
Titus, don't you think you'd feel better

02:12.674 --> 02:14.467
if you actually did something today?

02:14.551 --> 02:15.927
Does holding in a fart count?

02:16.010 --> 02:18.680
Why don't you go out
and get us more tape storage?

02:18.763 --> 02:21.724
<i>Now That Sounds Like Music!</i>
is a four-tape compilation,

02:21.808 --> 02:23.143
but we only have one slot left.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.227
Who gets it?

02:24.310 --> 02:28.356
It's like <i>Sophie's Choice </i> without Streep
chewing the scenery like a rat on drywall.

02:31.943 --> 02:36.531
I will also require a per diem,
as I am out of taffy.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.160
Oh, God!

02:40.243 --> 02:42.036
I forgot about the ants!

02:42.120 --> 02:43.538
They latched on to my tongue!

02:43.621 --> 02:44.621
I'll get them off!

02:44.664 --> 02:45.766
I can feel them giving birth!

02:45.790 --> 02:47.250
Then stop eating it!

03:24.078 --> 03:26.247
For your snacking enjoyment, sir,

03:26.331 --> 03:29.000
the cup holders
are filled with today's dips,

03:29.083 --> 03:30.585
bean and Fun.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.128
Lik-a-Stix can be found

03:32.211 --> 03:34.964
in a tear in the ceiling fabric above you.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.259
A priest, a rabbi, and a minister?

03:38.343 --> 03:40.929
Did you tell Union Theological
we need an overhead projector?

03:41.012 --> 03:42.931
Of course. You were on the email.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.557
Oh, my gosh!

03:44.641 --> 03:45.850
So funny!

03:45.934 --> 03:47.143
"On the email"?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.353
You guys.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.438
Late for work, huh?

03:50.521 --> 03:52.148
No thanks to John Mayer.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.741
Excuse me, Mr. Khaki Pants.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.327
I'm having trouble locating
your tape tower showroom.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.204
- Our what?
- Tape towers.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.205
For cassettes.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.541
I'm thinking of something
in a walnut veneer

04:10.625 --> 04:12.210
with a 50-tape capacity.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.629
Or 100, if you can sell me.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.432
Yeah, I don't think
they make those anymore.

04:17.464 --> 04:19.341
- Maybe try eBay?
- On the Internet?

04:19.425 --> 04:21.094
But I don't have a credit card.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.057
When Samuel L. Jackson asks
what's in my wallet,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.681
the answer is "ketchup packets."

04:33.940 --> 04:36.359
What, girl Uber?

04:36.442 --> 04:37.443
Yeah, Malala!

04:37.527 --> 04:38.736
You got the address?

04:38.820 --> 04:40.780
The spinning bar on top of the Marriott!

04:40.863 --> 04:42.007
Goes the opposite way of my spins,

04:42.031 --> 04:43.908
so I'm good for a couple more hours.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.286
Oop, let me help you there.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.249
What the hell's in the cup holder,

04:51.332 --> 04:52.625
pink cocaine and poop?

04:52.709 --> 04:54.168
Okay, yeah.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.171
I'll eat some poop
if I can get pink cocaine.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.134
So pretty fancy place you came out of.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.303
Metal silverware and everything.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.512
Special night?

05:04.595 --> 05:06.931
No, I go there all the time.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.768
They make the best vodka in a glass.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.775
Why does it smell like a pine tree
gave birth to an onion in here?

05:17.859 --> 05:18.985
Sorry.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.529
My roommate, Titus,
filled the shower with his dolls

05:21.612 --> 05:22.715
and didn't want to move them,

05:22.739 --> 05:25.241
so I had to take an Ohio shower

05:25.325 --> 05:27.160
using our disinfectant toilet wipes.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.287
But I am kind of like a toilet,

05:29.370 --> 05:31.372
'cause I'm white and full of beans!

05:31.456 --> 05:33.017
Why would you let him treat you that way?

05:33.041 --> 05:33.958
Is he hot?

05:34.042 --> 05:37.170
Well, he's really shiny.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.881
Kind of like a chess piece.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.883
I guess I just did it 'cause I'm nice.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.511
And that makes you happy?

05:45.595 --> 05:46.929
Um, yeah.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.181
Happy as a clam.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.600
So, like, clenched up tight, full of grit,

05:50.683 --> 05:52.894
and if you get pried open, you'll die?

05:52.977 --> 05:54.312
That's a good one.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.730
I got to remember that.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.107
But hey, do you always

05:58.191 --> 06:00.485
put other people's needs before yourses?

06:03.237 --> 06:04.655
I'm the Reverend!

06:04.739 --> 06:07.742
Which one of you dummies
wants to punch me?

06:07.825 --> 06:08.826
I hate you!

06:08.910 --> 06:10.536
Die!

06:12.538 --> 06:13.538
And furthermore...

06:16.959 --> 06:20.088
Well, I guess sometimes I put oth...

06:22.173 --> 06:26.010
Happy people value their needs
as much as otherses'.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.845
You need to go home and tell him...

06:27.929 --> 06:29.680
What is his name, Titties?

06:29.764 --> 06:32.809
You say, "Titties, I value my needs,

06:32.892 --> 06:34.936
and I needs to take a shower.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.187
Clean it up!"

06:36.813 --> 06:37.730
Quick question.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.774
How would you feel if I threw up?

06:39.857 --> 06:41.317
Oh, if you need to, that's fine.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.944
No, value your needs!

06:43.027 --> 06:45.321
Don't just let people...

06:45.404 --> 06:46.404
Oh, no.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.953
Good, you're up.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.371
Huh? Where am I?

06:53.454 --> 06:54.705
Kimmy?

06:54.789 --> 06:55.706
Of course I'm awake.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.892
Who eats Oreos in their sleep?

06:56.916 --> 06:57.834
You're crazy!

06:57.917 --> 06:59.502
Lookit, I need a shower.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.088
My needs are as important as yours.

07:03.339 --> 07:04.882
Women <i>are </i> funny!

07:04.966 --> 07:06.759
Take that, original <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

07:06.843 --> 07:08.219
Move your dolls.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.428
No means no, Kimmy.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.722
The Barbies' hair
got a little too straight.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.075
Now I'm giving them beach waves.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.143
Do I have to do everything around here?

07:15.226 --> 07:16.310
I'm the only one working.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.020
I cook all the Pop-Tarts.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.481
How dare you?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.066
You know I'm having a tough time,

07:22.150 --> 07:24.527
and then you El DeBarge in here
telling me about your needs?

07:24.610 --> 07:27.738
Happy people value their needs
as much as otherses'.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.031
Where'd you learn that?

07:29.115 --> 07:30.867
Have you been reading Chipotle bags again?

07:30.950 --> 07:32.785
Tonight I drove a really smart lady

07:32.869 --> 07:35.496
who gave me some advice
and had eaten corn earlier.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.974
How could you do this to my Barbies?

07:36.998 --> 07:40.118
You know, there's a special place in hell
for women who don't help other women.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.211
Oh, my gosh.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.796
Did you use the tape tower money

07:43.880 --> 07:46.215
to buy tiny hair products and Oreos?

07:46.299 --> 07:49.802
I'll have you know some youths
threw those Oreos at me.

07:49.886 --> 07:50.970
Unbelievable.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.181
I ask you to do one simple thing...

07:53.264 --> 07:54.474
Simple?

07:54.557 --> 07:55.725
More like impossible.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.853
I stood in front of that store for hours
before I realized

07:58.936 --> 08:00.271
the doors weren't automatic!

08:00.354 --> 08:02.273
I thought you were trying to change,

08:02.356 --> 08:04.859
to see things through, but you couldn't.

08:04.942 --> 08:05.860
You never can.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.111
You quit your job.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.946
You did your one-man show once.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.698
And look at this book you're reading.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.074
You dog-eared the cover!

08:13.534 --> 08:14.827
Oh, baby girl...

08:18.206 --> 08:19.457
I'm going wide.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.381
You think I'm the one
who does things halfway?

08:27.465 --> 08:28.758
"I'm Kimmy!

08:28.841 --> 08:31.052
I have my GED,

08:31.135 --> 08:34.554
I have normal kissing buddies
who definitely aren't deported,

08:34.639 --> 08:36.807
and I totally learned to whistle!"

08:39.268 --> 08:42.730
"And my emotion burps
don't smell like a kangaroo's pouch

08:42.813 --> 08:43.940
full of old Indian food!"

08:44.023 --> 08:45.107
You know what?

08:45.191 --> 08:48.110
I'm gonna take a drive to clear my head.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.655
And I can't even enjoy
how grown-up that sounds.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.288
Stupid Titus.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.750

10:25.166 --> 10:26.709
You got the address?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.461
"You up, question mark,

10:28.544 --> 10:30.421
cartoon eggplant, cartoon eggplant"?

10:30.504 --> 10:31.797
Where is that, SoHo?

10:31.881 --> 10:32.798
That wasn't for you.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.092
Seventy-ninth and Columbus.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.224
So I took your advice.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.186
I told my roommate
that I "valued my own needs,"

10:45.269 --> 10:46.729
and then guess what happened.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.731
You got in a fight, didn't you?

10:48.814 --> 10:51.150
Is Shanson three albinos?

10:51.233 --> 10:52.860
It was our worst fight ever.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.379
Even worse than that time I didn't know

10:54.403 --> 10:55.946
who or what Idris Elbow is.

10:56.030 --> 10:59.367
Some people are scared of conflict, but...

10:59.450 --> 11:00.785
it gets stuff done.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.664
Aw, this isn't vodka.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.290
I should never have listened to you.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.459
I mean, with all the stuff
Titus has going on...

11:08.542 --> 11:09.460
Shut up! Jesus.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.587
What about all the stuff you got going on?

11:11.671 --> 11:14.799
The only stuff I got going on
is that I got it going on.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.592
Really? Let's see.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.053
You're uncomfortable with conflict, obvs.

11:19.136 --> 11:20.805
How come is that? Huh?

11:20.888 --> 11:23.099
Number two... The deuce:

11:23.182 --> 11:25.309
you put other people's needs
ahead of yours

11:25.393 --> 11:27.645
because you're "nice."

11:27.728 --> 11:29.328
You know what's another word for "nice"?

11:29.355 --> 11:31.690
"Enabler."

11:31.774 --> 11:33.734
Number three: how you sleeping?

11:33.818 --> 11:35.611
On a pool raft with a sheet over it. Why?

11:35.694 --> 11:37.279
Look at that crap you're eating.

11:37.363 --> 11:41.492
Eating and sleep are closely connected,
you know.

11:41.575 --> 11:45.121
<i>♪ Your sleep cycle is erratic ♪</i>

11:45.204 --> 11:46.122
So?

11:46.205 --> 11:47.706
I used to live...

11:47.790 --> 11:48.958
windowlessly.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.126
You know who doesn't sleep?

11:50.209 --> 11:51.502
Depressed people.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.921
Well, you know who else
doesn't sleep a lot?

11:54.004 --> 11:54.922
Dolphins.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.173
And they're always smiling.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.842
Dolphins are rapists. Look it up.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.361
That's not why they're smiling, is it?

11:59.385 --> 12:03.889
And don't even get me started
on that peristalsis of yours.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.308
The stanky burps, girlfren!

12:06.392 --> 12:07.726
All burps smell bad.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.995
They're the farts of the face.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.063
No, you're Dursting.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.565
Did you ever see <i>The Jinx?</i>

12:12.648 --> 12:13.774
Fred Durst.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.067
He did those burps.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.278
You got some bad stuff inside,

12:17.361 --> 12:20.197
and your body is trying to blast it out

12:20.281 --> 12:21.615
through your face's mouth.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.827
Who shoved me?

12:31.750 --> 12:33.544
Okay.

12:34.628 --> 12:35.963
Ooh, see?

12:36.046 --> 12:38.382
This is what healthy burps smell like.

12:38.466 --> 12:42.553
Olives, cashews, P. Diddy vodka.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.056
Is this where you live?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.766
No, this is my office.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.060
I have a eight a.m.,
so I'm just gonna sleep here.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.438
The couch pulls out, so...

12:52.521 --> 12:54.231
I can't get pregnant.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.360
Help me!

12:58.444 --> 13:00.654
Stop struggling.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.240
You like this, lesbo?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.952
I should charge you
for all this free therapy...

13:08.454 --> 13:09.497
Serapy.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.374
What do you mean "therapy"?

13:12.458 --> 13:14.960
Wait, you're a psychiatrist?

13:15.044 --> 13:16.962
Yeah, and I'm good.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.246
I got one of these little noise machines
and everything.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.384
It goes "shh"

13:22.468 --> 13:24.637

13:25.471 --> 13:29.016

13:29.099 --> 13:30.184
Who, me?

13:30.267 --> 13:31.268
I don't need therapy.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.937
Yeah, you do.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.903
Okay, well, I think
I've gone above and beyond

13:40.986 --> 13:42.279
the Uber oath that I made up.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.533
Listen, I'm telling you this
because I love you.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.701
If you don't deal with
whatever you're repressing,

13:47.785 --> 13:49.912
one day, your body's gonna take over

13:49.995 --> 13:52.248
and do something rough.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.960
You'll find yourself
wandering along a highway

13:56.043 --> 13:59.255
or eating at a Boston Market.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.256
No.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.716
I am in control of my own body.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.218
Always.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.013
Why won't you open?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.475
Oh, oh, my spine, my spine.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.435
I'm gonna rip your beard off.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.021
Ugh, why does this keep happening?

14:16.105 --> 14:17.523
Miss, for a dollar,

14:17.606 --> 14:20.150

or is she just tall?

14:20.234 --> 14:21.402
- Ow!
- Too loud!

14:21.485 --> 14:22.862
- What?
- What are you?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.154
No, she's a treasure!

14:24.238 --> 14:25.614

14:28.242 --> 14:29.326

14:31.453 --> 14:32.496

14:32.580 --> 14:35.124
when you shove your problems down,

14:35.207 --> 14:37.501
they're gonna bust out in weird ways.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.591
Whatever, Andrea.

14:43.674 --> 14:46.594
I don't need to be shrunk

14:55.728 --> 14:57.229

14:57.313 --> 14:58.898
and having to chew my own haircuts,

14:58.981 --> 15:00.482
that's all ancient history,

15:00.566 --> 15:03.694
like George Washington or Bradifer.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.863
Oh, but Andrea's so smart.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.740
I'm repressing stuff.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.993

15:37.144 --> 15:38.896

17:11.320 --> 17:12.823
I've lost control.

and emptied them in that trash can.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.467
Oh, you.

17:31.550 --> 17:35.345
Yes, I remember your shape. Kimmy.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.474

17:38.557 --> 17:40.559
Um...

17:40.642 --> 17:42.770
I'm just trying to put you to bed.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.730

17:44.813 --> 17:46.523
Baby no go night-night.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.484
Wow, okay.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.319
I apologize that you had to see that.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.905
Obviously, I can't be the person
to help you.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.323
What? Why?

17:54.406 --> 17:55.800
I mean, I tucked you in and helped you

17:55.824 --> 17:57.659
cut up pictures of someone named Trent.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.786
Good Lord, that's why.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.579
It would be completely unethical.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.415
The doctor-patient relationship
requires boundaries.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.559
But what if it wasn't that?

18:04.583 --> 18:06.376
What if we helped each other?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.253
Helping is kind of my thing.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.923
I helped Ms. Jacqueline
get divorced and poor.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.132
That doesn't sound great.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.134
But I know I could get that vodka monkey

18:14.218 --> 18:15.969
off your back and into a tuxedo,

18:16.053 --> 18:17.387
the way monkeys look best.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.889
No! God.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.307
I make my life work

18:20.390 --> 18:23.644
by separating my days
from what I do at night.

18:23.727 --> 18:26.230
It's called compartmentalizing,
and it's not a problem,

18:26.313 --> 18:28.857
because I know the words to describe it.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.861
Andrea, this morning,
my body went to Coney Island without me.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.738
I woke up on a roller coaster.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.698
A dissociative fugue?

18:36.782 --> 18:39.743
A huge... what you said.

18:39.827 --> 18:40.953
But why a roller coaster?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.412
What is the significance...

18:42.496 --> 18:43.872
No. Boundaries.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.208
You told me to ask for what I need,

18:46.291 --> 18:48.418
and I need you.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.421
I can't. I'm sorry.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.965
Excuse me, Dr. Bayden.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.234
- Harold, damn it.
- Couch man!

18:54.258 --> 18:55.551
Is this coming out of my time?

18:55.634 --> 18:56.760
Harold, I apologize.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.346
I know you have anxiety
about being overlooked,

18:59.429 --> 19:01.598
but I would point out
that you made the choice

19:01.682 --> 19:03.475
to wear the same colors as my couch.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.811
Even my cat forgets I'm there.

19:05.894 --> 19:08.605
She just ruins my stuff in front of me.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.441
Please excuse us.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.081
I woke up on a roller coaster.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.416
You and me both, girl.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.751
I've tried to buy a tape tower,
make a tape tower.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.628
Hell, I tried to buy a tape tower.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.089
In the process, my R. Kelly cassingle

19:34.173 --> 19:36.216
passed on to R&amp;B heaven.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.515
It's trapped in the closet
with angels now.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.976
Big surprise.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.228
But that's not gonna stop me.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.789
You think I can't do anything
without your help,

19:49.813 --> 19:51.607
but I'm gonna prove you wrong.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.525
I just need one thing: your help.

19:53.609 --> 19:54.609
Too bad!

19:54.651 --> 19:56.862
I need to help myself, Titus,
but I don't know how.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.739
I've got all this junk from the past...

19:58.822 --> 20:00.407
Junk? Past?

20:00.490 --> 20:01.408
Kimmy, you did it!

20:01.491 --> 20:02.534
All by myself!

20:02.618 --> 20:04.995
In order to find this tape tower,
I have to go back in time,

20:05.078 --> 20:06.496
and I know just where to do it.

20:08.081 --> 20:11.168
I mean, I'm here for you.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.045
Of course my thing can wait.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.046
But full disclosure,

20:14.129 --> 20:16.048
I can feel myself giving up on it already.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.049
Soon I'll be sitting,

20:17.132 --> 20:19.551
and you know
all my clothes double as pajamas.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.802
Whatever. Just go.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.512
I'd rather be alone anyway.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.348
Chin up, baby girl.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.767
No, really, you're turkey-necking.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.143
Love you!

20:31.980 --> 20:33.690
- Hello?
- It's Andrea!

20:33.774 --> 20:35.275
Pick me up, bitch!

20:35.359 --> 20:36.276
No!

20:36.360 --> 20:37.360
How'd you get my number?

20:37.402 --> 20:39.321
I told Uber I left a baby in your car.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.698
Come on, you said you'd help me, right?

20:41.782 --> 20:42.908
Is this about your drinking?

20:42.991 --> 20:43.991
It is.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.244
She said, gravely.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.995
<i>Why should I do anything for you?</i>

20:47.079 --> 20:48.538
You wouldn't help me.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.766
And how did that make you feel?

20:49.790 --> 20:51.124
Crummy!

20:51.208 --> 20:53.335
And now you want another person
to feel crummy?

20:53.418 --> 20:54.878
Of course not.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.257
Then pick me up, playa!

20:59.633 --> 21:02.386
<i>♪ You're doing stuff ♪</i>

21:02.469 --> 21:05.931
<i>♪ Making moves left and right... ♪</i>

21:06.014 --> 21:07.557
Discarded Livestrong bracelets.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.518
The Union Cycliste Internationale

21:09.601 --> 21:11.979
voided Lance Armstrong's titles in 2012.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.398
I'm going back in time!

21:17.901 --> 21:19.861
This doesn't look like where they sent
Dylan McKay

21:19.903 --> 21:21.989
for his drinking problem.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.283
No, this isn't rehab.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.369
We just got to steal my ex-boyfriend's dog
real quick.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.495
What?

21:28.578 --> 21:29.830
Yeah, this'll show him

21:29.913 --> 21:32.249
that we should get back together.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.126
You told me this was about your drinking.

21:34.209 --> 21:35.043
It is.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.879
If I weren't so drunk,
I could steal a dog by myself.

21:39.673 --> 21:40.757
Really?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.259
You're just gonna abandon me here

21:42.342 --> 21:43.760
in the middle of nowhere,

21:43.844 --> 21:47.848
drunk, with no ride home and no shoes?

21:53.312 --> 21:54.604
I know you, Kimmy.

21:54.688 --> 21:58.442
You're a helper and a self-sacrificer.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.527
Watch.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.945
- Fudge!
- Trust fall.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.575
I'm in your head.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.078
Well, I'm in your head too.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.080
I know you're gonna throw up later.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.498
No shiss, Herlock!

22:17.085 --> 22:18.837
Here, boy or girl.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.678
Here, boy or girl.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.266
I found the dog!

22:31.349 --> 22:32.809
Feel how soft his head is.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.019
That's not Trent's dog.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.521
Oh, this isn't Trent's house.

22:36.605 --> 22:41.568
Right, he moved to Denver
to "work on his marriage."

22:41.651 --> 22:42.944
Someone's coming.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.155
- Run, Lillian!
- Suck it, Trent.

22:45.238 --> 22:46.448
I love you!

22:47.532 --> 22:48.676
You said this was the wrong house!

22:48.700 --> 22:50.285
I forgot.

22:51.828 --> 22:54.915
Well, I'm sorry you had
a kick-ass adventure

22:54.998 --> 22:56.833
and met a dog.

22:59.211 --> 23:03.256
Ugh, did I write myself another note
during the day?

23:05.175 --> 23:06.968
"Please don't get drunk tonight.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.762
Think of Mom.

23:08.845 --> 23:11.223
And you should be working on the book.

23:11.306 --> 23:12.307
Please!"

23:12.390 --> 23:14.059
Ugh.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.727
Day me sucks.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.521
I'm sorry she wouldn't treat you.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.439
Maybe I could see you at night.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.066
No, if I'm gonna do this,

23:21.149 --> 23:23.652
I kind of want someone
who remembers stuff.

23:23.735 --> 23:27.114
Okay, well,
maybe I could see you at night.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.050
It's like, I finally figure out
that I need help,

23:29.074 --> 23:30.492
and I can't even get it.

23:30.575 --> 23:31.701
What is your deal again?

23:33.787 --> 23:35.455
I was locked in an underground bunker

23:35.539 --> 23:37.582
for 15 years by an insane reverend.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.751
Shut your tomato face.

23:39.835 --> 23:43.380
Come on, I gots to treat you!

23:43.463 --> 23:45.924
Well, maybe you should write a note
to day you about that.

23:47.217 --> 23:50.720
Even if I could hold a pen right now,
she would never listen to me.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.430
Unless...

24:00.105 --> 24:01.606
That foot has a toe ring on it.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.608
I'm in the '90s!

24:15.745 --> 24:17.080
Nineteen ninety-nine!

24:21.543 --> 24:22.586
A Furby!

24:23.712 --> 24:24.921
Oh, God, it's still alive!

24:25.005 --> 24:26.381
<i>Kill me!</i>

24:43.356 --> 24:45.984
Sweet Baby Jesus Jones.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.287
What's up, Doc?

24:57.370 --> 24:59.140
I had a carrot,
but I dropped it on the subway.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.082
Kimmy, this is a nonstarter.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.084
- You said you'd say that.
- When?

25:03.168 --> 25:05.503
Oh, God, did I see you last night?

25:05.587 --> 25:07.505
Why don't I let you answer that?

25:08.924 --> 25:10.217
<i>What up, Drea?</i>

25:10.300 --> 25:12.802
<i>Yeah, you're Drea from New Jersey.</i>

25:12.886 --> 25:14.846
Ugh, she's awful, right?

25:14.930 --> 25:16.782
I mean, you don't like
spending time with her, do you?

25:16.806 --> 25:17.724
I'm the fun one.

25:17.807 --> 25:18.850
I ran the marathon.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.560
<i>Here's the deal, dummy.</i>

25:20.644 --> 25:22.062
<i>You help this girl,</i>

25:22.145 --> 25:23.813
<i>or this little videotape is going</i>

25:23.897 --> 25:28.777
<i>to the state licensing board,
Trent, Dr. Gursky,</i>

25:28.860 --> 25:31.071
<i>and all our stepdads.</i>

25:31.154 --> 25:32.072
<i>Suck it.</i>

25:32.155 --> 25:34.074
Kimmy, you don't strike me
as the type of person

25:34.157 --> 25:35.075
who would blackmail...

25:35.158 --> 25:36.201
You should keep watching.

25:36.284 --> 25:39.204
<i>I know you know
Kimmy wouldn't blackmail us.</i>

25:39.287 --> 25:41.373
<i>Look at this face.</i>

25:41.456 --> 25:43.375
<i>- Say a bad word.
- Frown.</i>

25:43.458 --> 25:45.377
<i>Sorry!</i>

25:45.460 --> 25:48.171
<i>She's a good person, but I'm not.</i>

25:48.255 --> 25:50.840
<i>I sell my doorman Adderall!</i>

25:51.633 --> 25:53.093
<i>Come on.</i>

25:53.176 --> 25:54.803
<i>You know you want to shrink the eff</i>

25:54.886 --> 25:57.806
<i>out of that busted little walnut brain
in a clown wig.</i>

25:57.889 --> 26:00.392
- <i>Hey!
- Because Kimmy's got real problems.</i>

26:00.475 --> 26:02.352
<i>Worse than us, and I know you are</i>

26:02.435 --> 26:06.690
<i>sick of listening to all that weak-tit
Manhattan angst.</i>

26:06.773 --> 26:08.984
<i>"I have so many unread emails!"</i>

26:09.067 --> 26:11.444
<i>"My child's not learning enough Mandarin!"</i>

26:11.528 --> 26:13.905
<i>"Why is it so warm in November?"</i>

26:13.989 --> 26:15.490
<i>You're doing this.</i>

26:15.573 --> 26:17.492
<i>You need to do this.</i>

26:17.575 --> 26:20.745
<i>And a happy person values their needs.</i>

26:20.829 --> 26:23.581
<i>Future Kimmy, give her the envelope.</i>

26:25.333 --> 26:26.543
Sorry.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.045
What is...

26:30.088 --> 26:31.256
Ugh.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.924
<i>I farted in there.</i>

26:39.848 --> 26:41.891
All right.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.018
Let's get started.

26:45.645 --> 26:46.563
Dang it, Harold!

26:46.646 --> 26:47.564
But I'm a person!

26:47.647 --> 26:49.482
How long have you been in here?

26:59.159 --> 27:00.785
Titus, you did it!

27:00.869 --> 27:02.871
I know! I did!

27:02.954 --> 27:04.748
I'm almost there!

27:04.831 --> 27:06.624
I'm a really slow runner.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.751
Should I wait here, or...

27:07.834 --> 27:09.252
Whatever you want.

27:12.672 --> 27:14.758
I did something too.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.426
I'm starting therapy tomorrow.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.762
We are both equally brave.

27:18.845 --> 27:21.389
I just wish I could get
my R. Kelly cassingle back.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.808
You know what's just as good
if you don't listen that hard?
