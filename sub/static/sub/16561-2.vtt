WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.234
.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.109
- Morning.

00:08.141 --> 00:11.479
I have to pick up Owen
at Helen's before work.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.147
- Yeah, I get it.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.519
- You know, um,

00:18.552 --> 00:23.124
last night was...
it was really great.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.293
- Yeah, it was.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.232
- Huh.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.072
I don't think
I've seen this one before.

00:38.106 --> 00:41.075
[gentle instrumental music]

00:41.109 --> 00:45.346
*

00:45.379 --> 00:48.116
- Helmand Province.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.650
That was
our last deployment together.

00:49.683 --> 00:53.154
- Wow.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.556
Jeff looks so young.

00:55.589 --> 01:02.062
*

01:03.497 --> 01:05.166
- Hey, we're good, right?

01:06.334 --> 01:07.435
- Of course.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.370
- Okay.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.373
- Good.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.610
Bye.
- See ya.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.450
- This is what I always carried
in the field:

01:22.483 --> 01:24.585
gear for fluid resuscitation,
hemorrhage control,

01:24.618 --> 01:27.355
airway management, basic meds,
including OTCs.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.291
Always have lots of Pepto.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.892
Oh, and tape.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.195
Can never have too much tape.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.863
- [chuckles]
Yes, sir.

01:35.896 --> 01:39.233
It's a lot to take in.

01:39.267 --> 01:42.136
- I know.
When do you deploy?

01:42.170 --> 01:44.172
- 12 weeks, sir.

01:44.205 --> 01:48.142
- Look, nothing really
prepares you for war.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.611
But a day in Chicago,
the number of gunshots we see,

01:50.644 --> 01:52.913
the navy sending corpsmen
for a rotation in the ED

01:52.946 --> 01:54.415
is a pretty good primer.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.519
- What's that, sir?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.421
Is it a quick reference guide?

02:01.655 --> 02:04.158
- Case notes from the field.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.594
Things I thought
I shouldn't forget.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.530
- Dr. Choi, we got
a drive up and drop.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.332
- Corpsman, with me.
- Sir.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.235
[dramatic music]

02:14.268 --> 02:16.570
- [gasping and wheezing]

02:16.604 --> 02:18.639
[car horn blares, tires screech]

02:18.672 --> 02:20.574
- All right, I got you, buddy.
I got you, okay?

02:20.608 --> 02:22.643
Hey, what's your name?
CuÃ¡l es tu nombre?

02:22.676 --> 02:24.645
Huh?
- [wheezing] Marco.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.514
- Marco. Marco, okay.
You stay with me.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.349
We're gonna take care of you.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.385
Single GSW.
Left flank thoracoabdomen.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.354
No exit wound.
- Weak pulse.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.455
Corpsman, cut his shirt off.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.690
- Yes, sir.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.193
- [wheezing]

02:39.227 --> 02:42.296
[speaking Spanish]

02:42.330 --> 02:44.265
[coughing]
- Hey, hey, corpsman.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.466
What do you hear?

02:45.499 --> 02:50.538
*

02:50.571 --> 02:52.440
- Come on. Hey.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.508
- I have weak breath sounds
on the left side.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.676
- Means the lung is collapsed.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.545
Air leaking out
is pressurizing his chest.

02:57.578 --> 02:58.779
He's got a tension pneumothorax.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.948
Breath sounds unilateral and
tachycardic, needle the chest.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.750
- Hold pressure.
- Yes, sir.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.454
- In.
- Okay.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.655
- Breath sounds improving.
- Good.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.957
- Bring in a board.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.792
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.594
All right, let's move him
on my count.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.596
One, two, three.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.565
[strains]

03:17.598 --> 03:19.700
Jeff, let's get an AP chest
X-ray and prep a chest tube.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.569
- Got it.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.736
- He said, "I'm only 18."

03:22.770 --> 03:24.672
- Welcome to Chi-raq.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:34.014 --> 03:36.250
- All right, now try
to stay off the hoverboard

03:36.284 --> 03:37.751
for at least a week,
Hudson, okay?

03:37.785 --> 03:39.887
Yeah? Bye. Thank you.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.925
Hey, Gayle. Taking your daily
lap around our gorgeous grounds?

03:44.958 --> 03:47.328
- Anything to get out of
the pediatric ICU for a minute.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.862
I swear, if I hear
another monitor beep,

03:48.896 --> 03:50.731
I'm gonna nosedive
onto Michigan Avenue.

03:50.764 --> 03:54.268
- And how is little Timmy doing?
Hey, cutie!

03:54.302 --> 03:57.037
- He's had a good month,
thanks to Dr. Rhodes.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.607
Hoped we'd finally
get to go outside today.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.608
Probably best
we head back upstairs.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.876
- Dr. Manning?
- It was nice seeing you, Gayle.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.744
- You too.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.547
- Right away.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.682
- Hi. My daughter, Alicia.
She stopped nursing.

04:08.716 --> 04:09.950
She's only three months old.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.018
- Okay, well, don't worry.

04:11.051 --> 04:11.919
We'll figure out
what's going on.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.053
Why don't you follow me
into the back?

04:13.086 --> 04:15.623
I'll take the paperwork.
You guys want to go in the back?

04:15.656 --> 04:17.291
- Yep.
- All right.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.362
- Okay, got a new favorite:
Capgras Syndrome.

04:21.394 --> 04:24.332
The belief a familiar person has
been replaced with a duplicate.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.867
- That's cool.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.670
- That was an unenthusiastic
response, even for you.

04:29.703 --> 04:33.607
- Sorry.
It's the new pathology resident.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.744
Mark.
He's in my head.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.379
- What's going on?

04:38.412 --> 04:41.682
- He's pushing really hard
to get drinks after work.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.418
Hang out on the weekends.
Be pals.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.853
It's uncomfortable.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.756
- Why? Are you worried
something bad will happen

04:48.789 --> 04:50.658
if you become friends?

04:50.691 --> 04:53.694
- What? No, it's just
I'd rather be colleagues.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.095
I got enough friends.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.864
- Is there a limit
to the number of people

04:56.897 --> 04:58.366
you can let into your life?

04:58.399 --> 05:01.969
- Maybe. Yeah.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.337
What is all this?

05:03.371 --> 05:05.873
- Nothing.
We're just talking.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.776
- Okay.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.911
I've gotta get back.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.881
- Are we still on for dinner?
- Yeah, sure.

05:17.485 --> 05:20.654
[Alicia fussing]

05:20.688 --> 05:22.356
- She's gurgling a bit,

05:22.390 --> 05:24.392
but there's no obstruction
in her throat.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.859
She doesn't appear
too dehydrated,

05:25.893 --> 05:27.895
and her membranes are moist.

05:27.928 --> 05:28.929
When did she stop nursing?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.898
- Yesterday.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.400
I wasn't too worried at first.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.734
My boys were both
finicky eaters.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.736
But when she wouldn't nurse
at all today...

05:35.769 --> 05:37.004
- Any fever or vomiting?

05:37.037 --> 05:39.106
- No, none.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.074
She's been a bit cranky.

05:41.108 --> 05:44.044
She's been napping longer
than usual, but that's about it.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.014
- Mama, I'm thirsty.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.382
- Okay, baby,
we will get you a drink

05:48.416 --> 05:50.851
as soon as we speak
to the doctor, okay?

05:50.884 --> 05:52.386
All right? No, no, no.
[child crying]

05:52.420 --> 05:53.787
I'm so sorry.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.756
We go to the park every day.
They're exhausted.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.090
My husband will be here
to help any minute.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.126
- Don't worry about it.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.395
Let's get a CBC, CMP,

06:01.429 --> 06:02.930
an abdominal ultrasound
and a babygram.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.399
- Yes, doctor.
- A babygram?

06:05.433 --> 06:07.100
- An X-ray of her entire body.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.802
- So this could be serious.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.904
- There's no way
to know for sure just yet,

06:10.938 --> 06:12.105
but I want to cover
all our bases.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.074
- I should've
brought her in sooner.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.743
It's just
with my husband at work--

06:15.776 --> 06:18.446
- Look, you are juggling
three kids.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.147
Okay, I get it.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.816
I only have one
and it's a handful.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.885
I will fill you in
as soon as we know anything.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.119
- Thank you.

06:28.121 --> 06:31.425
- No, Nina, I've ditched cable,
cut up my credit cards,

06:31.459 --> 06:33.427
and have nothing left
to sell on Craigslist.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.163
Yet, I'm still in the hole
each month when the vig is due.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.699
- Easy there, Vegas.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.834
It's med school loans
and malpractice insurance,

06:40.868 --> 06:41.869
not a note from a bookie.

06:41.902 --> 06:45.706
- Either way, I'm broke.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.975
Had to post an ad
for a roommate.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.843
- Here, look at this.

06:49.877 --> 06:52.112
Come on,
it'll make you feel better.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.947
- What is it?

06:53.981 --> 06:56.450
- Molluscum contagiosum.

06:56.484 --> 07:00.821
It's a type of pox virus.
It's a nasty one, actually.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.991
Even so, stunning, right?

07:04.024 --> 07:07.127
Like 10 pounds
of raspberry rock candy

07:07.160 --> 07:09.162
pressed into a 5-pound bag.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.901
- [laughs]

07:15.503 --> 07:17.471
- Come on, you must have
a day off, right?

07:17.505 --> 07:18.872
Go then!

07:18.906 --> 07:21.875
It's summertime,
the animals are really playful.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.478
Elephants are my favorite.
They're so soulful.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.846
- Okay, you sold me.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.981
This Saturday,
I'm at the Lincoln Park Zoo.

07:28.015 --> 07:32.886
BP 126 over 82.
Heart rate 74. Sats 100%.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.888
- Hi, Mr. McGregor,
I'm Dr. Halstead.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.957
I understand you fell,
hurt both wrists.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.926
- Yeah, just a moment
of clumsiness, you know.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.761
They feel better already now.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.263
- Don't be modest.
He's here. Let him help.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.066
- I put my hands out just trying
to catch my fall, you know?

07:46.099 --> 07:48.902
15 years on the street.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.004
I guess I'm not as fast
as I used to be.

07:51.038 --> 07:51.939
Ahh!

07:51.972 --> 07:55.275
- AP and lateral X-rays
of both wrists.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.177
Have you fallen before,
Mr. McGregor?

07:57.210 --> 08:00.548
- A few times. So much action
in the city nowadays.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.883
You stop paying attention
for a second...bam!

08:02.916 --> 08:04.117
Face plant.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.557
You're a big guy, Dr. Halstead.
Football?

08:09.590 --> 08:12.526
- Baseball.
Just a fan now, though.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.961
- Cubs or Sox?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.063
- Southside pride.
Sox all the way.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.065
- Ah, I'm a Cubs guy.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.867
- I won't hold it against you.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.035
- Love Wrigley.

08:22.069 --> 08:25.072
The way the ivy creeps along
the outfield wall,

08:25.105 --> 08:27.941
the perfect stripes mowed
right into the infield grass.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.242
Breathtaking.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.844
- Do you stay
near the ball park?

08:30.878 --> 08:33.547
- During the season.
Sure, why not?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.648
You know, it's fun
seeing the players.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.549
In person,
they're larger than life.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.019
Moises Alou.
Sammy Sosa.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.822
- Oh, yeah? Wow.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.957
Must be really exciting.
- Oh, yeah!

08:43.991 --> 08:47.094
- Mr. McGregor, after your
X-rays, I want to run an EKG.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.196
Determine if a cardiac event
caused your fall.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.632
Sound good?
- Sure, yeah.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.133
- All right, we'll see you soon.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.641
- You know,
they haven't had elephants

09:00.674 --> 09:02.175
at the Lincoln Park Zoo
for ages.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.877
- Mm-hmm.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.345
- You think he really met
those baseball players?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.980
- Not recently.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.349
Alou and Sosa's last season
with the Cubs was in '04.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.218
So, I guess, maybe Mr. McGregor

09:11.251 --> 09:13.954
could have seen them
outside the park...

09:13.987 --> 09:15.255
- Maybe not.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.290
- Unfortunately, homelessness
and mental illness

09:17.324 --> 09:18.859
often go hand in hand.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.260
I'll page Dr. Charles
for a consult.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.895
- Okay.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.170
- How's Marco doing, sir?

09:30.203 --> 09:32.072
- Bullet looks to have lodged
in the midline

09:32.105 --> 09:33.373
between the spine and heart.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.609
May even be touching the aorta.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.144
Bad spot.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.280
- You get a lot like him?

09:40.313 --> 09:44.117
Drive up and drops?
- Yeah.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.886
Easy way
to get your boys patched up

09:45.919 --> 09:48.288
without having to answer
any questions.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.023
Hey, Marco.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.692
A trauma surgeon
is gonna come see you.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.894
She'll decide
how best to proceed.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.963
- Will you cut me open?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.699
- Probably.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.004
If the bullet shifts inside you,
it could do a lot of damage.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.973
- [speaks Spanish]

10:06.006 --> 10:09.309
- No, man.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.044
Not "whatever."

10:11.078 --> 10:15.048
Lot of you guys come in here
and don't make it out.

10:15.082 --> 10:19.653
If you do,
make it mean something.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.389
- [speaks Spanish]

10:22.422 --> 10:24.157
I ain't afraid.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.426
- Okay.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.096
- [speaking Spanish]

10:29.129 --> 10:31.398
Estan meurtos.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.734
- He's saying that--
- The usual.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.769
Revenge.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.106
[monitors beeping]

10:39.139 --> 10:41.274
- Timothy Williams,
eight months old.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.177
Diagnosed with Hypoplastic
Left Heart Syndrome.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.079
Bryan, can you tell us
what that is?

10:46.113 --> 10:49.016
- I know.
It's a congenital heart defect.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.984
Left side of the heart can't
efficiently pump blood,

10:51.018 --> 10:51.885
so the right side has to pump it

10:51.919 --> 10:53.253
to the lungs
and the rest of the body.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.223
- Correct.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.225
Tim is on
the heart transplant list.

10:58.258 --> 11:02.229
But he's developing fluid around
his lungs, a pleural effusion.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.699
He requires a thoracentesis
to drain it.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.201
The patient is sedated,
and the ultrasound shows

11:08.235 --> 11:10.704
the fluid
surrounding his right lung.

11:10.738 --> 11:14.274
Lidocaine is injected

11:14.307 --> 11:16.309
just below the surface
of the skin,

11:16.343 --> 11:19.312
forming a wheel.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.115
We go through the wheel

11:22.149 --> 11:24.417
and into the pleural space.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.420
Staying above the rib because
the blood vessels are below.

11:27.454 --> 11:31.458
Go too far,
puncture the lung.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.027
Once you're in,
aspirate the fluid.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.068
Give us a minute.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.178
Gayle, John,

11:51.211 --> 11:54.447
I think it's best that Tim not
leave the PICU going forward.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.183
No more trips downstairs.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.384
- You mean keep him on the vent.

11:57.417 --> 12:01.321
- He's not oxygenating well.
His lungs are very congested.

12:01.354 --> 12:04.324
- He's gonna
get a heart soon.

12:04.357 --> 12:07.260
Listen, everything's gonna be
okay, you hear me?

12:07.294 --> 12:09.763
- I'm gonna check
the transplant list.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.431
See if there's been
any movement.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.233
- Thanks.

12:15.168 --> 12:18.138
[somber music]

12:18.171 --> 12:25.212
*

12:27.180 --> 12:29.349
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.484
My husband, Andre,
took the boys to get some food.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.054
He'll be back soon. Any news?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.889
- The blood tests and babygram
were okay.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.225
Nothing abnormal on the
abdominal ultrasound either.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.460
- Oh, thank goodness.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.762
- Dr. Manning.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.334
- May I take a look at her?

12:47.367 --> 12:49.769
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.183
Do you have any family history
of neuromuscular disease?

13:03.216 --> 13:04.784
- No, none.

13:06.619 --> 13:10.824
- Her deep tendon reflexes
are diminished.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.193
She's floppy.
Her muscles are losing tone.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.162
- What is it? What do you see?

13:15.195 --> 13:18.098
- A baby's natural position
is to flex the legs.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.400
When straightened,
there should be some resistance.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.235
- Let's get a CT of her head.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.437
I want to make sure that there's
no swelling in her brain.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.605
- Swelling in her brain?

13:25.638 --> 13:28.541
- I don't know that's the case.
But we just have to check.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.243
If the CT comes back negative,

13:30.277 --> 13:32.512
then we'll do a lumbar puncture
to test her spinal fluid.

13:32.545 --> 13:33.914
- Why?

13:33.947 --> 13:36.349
- That'll let us know
if she has an infection.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.420
- My poor baby.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.590
- Just hang in there, okay?

13:43.623 --> 13:46.393
We'll know more soon.

13:46.426 --> 13:53.433
*

13:56.236 --> 13:58.271
- That is one sick baby.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.339
What do you think's going on?

13:59.372 --> 14:01.541
- I have no idea.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.487
- Surgeon ordered a chest CT.
I'll let you know what's up.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.123
- Okay.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.262
- Then what happened?

14:22.295 --> 14:24.597
- So they were all looking at me
and clapping, right?

14:24.631 --> 14:27.300
So I started dancing too.
We partied all afternoon.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.969
- Sounds like a blast.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.171
- You know, there'll probably be
another fiesta next week.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.240
Families rent that restaurant
for them all the time.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.507
You should check it out.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.110
- All day party do me good.
- [chuckles]

14:39.079 --> 14:40.513
- What was he telling you about?

14:40.547 --> 14:44.251
- A quinceaÃ±era
he attended last week.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.686
Didn't miss a detail
about the people he met,

14:46.719 --> 14:48.922
the clothes they wore,
the venue.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.123
I mean, he really thinks
he was there.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.191
- But he wasn't.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.593
- I know the place he's talking
about, or I knew it.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.663
Closed 10, 11 years ago.
It's a Starbucks now.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.365
- Schizophrenia?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.167
- Some kind
of delusional disorder.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.370
I mean, he also admitted
that he binge drinks sometimes.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.005
Even though he's sober now,

15:05.038 --> 15:07.540
could be alcoholic hallucinosis.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.209
I'm gonna order
an antipsychotic,

15:09.242 --> 15:10.944
see if we can narrow this down.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.546
- Well, for being homeless
the last 15 years,

15:13.580 --> 15:15.582
he seems pretty okay with it.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.952
Lucky guy.
- Lucky guy?

15:18.986 --> 15:21.021
Everything okay there, Doc?

15:21.054 --> 15:23.957
- Money problems.
Pretty embarrassing.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.626
Kind of all-consuming, actually.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.161
- Buy you lunch?

15:28.195 --> 15:29.229
- I'd rather
you write me a check.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.731
- Get in line there, amigo.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.601
- Her lips are turning blue!
What's happening?

15:34.634 --> 15:36.269
- She is
in respiratory distress,

15:36.303 --> 15:37.704
unable able to contract
her diaphragm

15:37.737 --> 15:38.738
and chest muscles enough.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.107
I need to intubate, now.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.574
- Broselow tape.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.043
- Mr. and Mrs. James,

15:43.076 --> 15:44.311
I'm gonna need you
to step outside, please.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.246
- Sats are falling.
Heart rate stable.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.182
[tense music]

15:49.216 --> 15:50.750
- Pharynx is collapsing
around the scope.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.185
I need crich pressure!

15:52.219 --> 15:53.686
Suction.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.188
- Sats still falling. 40%.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.290
Heart rate's dropping.
It's at 60. Atropine?

15:57.324 --> 15:58.391
- Not yet.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.426
- It's been a minute.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.362
[monitor beeping rapidly]

16:02.395 --> 16:04.064
- Heart rate 30.
O2 sat is zero.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.965
- We're running out of time.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.638
- I got it! I'm in!

16:11.671 --> 16:13.706
Give the atropine.
- Right away.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.608
0.5 IDA.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.677
[monitor beeping slows]

16:20.113 --> 16:22.115
- Sats coming up.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.284
Heart rate 130. Sats 99.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.653
- How long did it take
to intubate?

16:26.686 --> 16:28.155
- Almost two minutes.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.224
- Pupils are fixed and dilated.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.325
Call PICU for a bed.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.061
- Got you.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.064
- Have to go talk to the family.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.333
- Want me to join you?

16:40.367 --> 16:42.402
- No, no, I got this.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.037
But thank you.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.777
- Okay, well, how about
Thursday?

16:50.810 --> 16:53.313
- I'm busy Thursday too.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.148
- Pretty busy week.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.385
- Run something by you,
Dr. Charles?

16:58.418 --> 17:00.120
- Shoot.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.721
- I was speaking
with a colleague this morning.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.757
My age, intelligent,
compassionate, a great person.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.459
But shy.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.095
- Asocial?

17:08.127 --> 17:11.131
- Not a loner per se,
but comfortable being alone.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.832
Recently, he's been presented
with an opportunity

17:12.865 --> 17:15.068
to expand his social circle.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.736
He wants nothing to do with it.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.406
- So?
What are you thinking?

17:19.439 --> 17:22.108
- His reaction,
actually his overreaction,

17:22.142 --> 17:24.310
screams avoidant
personality disorder.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.679
- Hm. This is a colleague?

17:26.713 --> 17:27.747
- A close one.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.249
Probably why I never noticed

17:29.282 --> 17:31.418
that he meets
four of the seven APD criteria

17:31.451 --> 17:33.220
outlined in the DCM.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.787
The psych fits, doesn't it?

17:34.821 --> 17:37.290
- Clinically, yeah, I guess.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.358
- Well, I'm gonna have to
talk to him about this,

17:38.391 --> 17:41.128
but I don't want him to feel
criticized or rejected.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.832
Excuse me,
I've got some reading to do.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.435
- Do you think "cat lover"
means "cat" or "cats"?

17:48.468 --> 17:50.503
- Does it matter?

17:50.537 --> 17:54.207
- Good point. Pass.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.176
What's cosplay?

17:56.209 --> 17:59.212
- Oh.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.848
- Yeah, okay, another pass.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.151
The roommate search
is not going well.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.453
- You're trolling the Internet.
What'd you expect?

18:06.486 --> 18:08.555
- It's the hospital
community page.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.124
I don't know, someone like me.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.226
- Oh, you mean, like, a slightly
anal, overly stubborn,

18:13.260 --> 18:16.396
rule breaking, control freak?

18:16.429 --> 18:19.199
Good luck.
- Really? When I'm already down?

18:19.232 --> 18:22.435
- Mr. McGregor's EKG and
troponin results are normal.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.204
Cardiac event
didn't cause his fall.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.872
Stroke?

18:25.905 --> 18:28.908
- Maybe. Or a bleed.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.545
Either way,
could affect his balance.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.181
Let's get a CT.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.287
- So what does that mean?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.788
- There could have been
a brain injury

18:41.821 --> 18:43.456
due to lack of oxygen.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.458
We're running
a cerebral flow study

18:45.492 --> 18:48.395
to make sure that blood
is reaching her brain.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.400
- This isn't happening.

18:54.901 --> 18:58.271
Yesterday, I was--I was
singing to her in the bathtub.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.507
And now, she's hooked up
to all these machines--

19:00.540 --> 19:01.874
[alarm chimes]

19:01.908 --> 19:03.410
- Dr. Rhodes!

19:03.443 --> 19:05.545
- Code blue.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.280
Code blue.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.419
- No pulse.
- Start compressions.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.820
Get him off the vent
and bag him!

19:13.853 --> 19:16.623
.07 milligrams of epi.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.226
He's in V-fib.

19:19.259 --> 19:22.529
Charge to 15 joules.
- Charge 15.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.631
Charged.
- Hold compressions.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.333
Clear!

19:29.636 --> 19:31.604
We're back in sinus rhythm.
- We have a pulse.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.206
- [sobbing]

19:39.011 --> 19:40.647
- My God.

19:49.522 --> 19:49.656
.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.525
- He's fourth
on the organ transplant list,

19:52.559 --> 19:53.893
but he doesn't have time.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.863
If, by some chance,
four hearts do become available,

19:56.896 --> 19:58.831
one still has to be
an HLA match.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.500
- I know the odds seem bleak,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.935
but children under a year
have to receive organs

20:02.969 --> 20:04.904
from similarly-aged donors.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.939
The pool of recipients
is smaller--

20:06.973 --> 20:10.643
- Yes, but so is
the pool of donors.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.380
Ms. Goodwin, I can't perform
another thoracentesis.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.548
His lungs are too weak.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.585
Without a transplant,
he's gonna die.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.620
I'm contacting the other doctors
on the donor list.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.990
I'm pleading my case...

20:24.023 --> 20:25.658
- Okay.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.760
I have a contact
at Gift of Hope,

20:27.794 --> 20:29.028
a friend of a friend.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.597
Hold on.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.700
I will do my best to get
Timothy pushed to the top

20:33.733 --> 20:34.934
of the UNOS list,

20:34.967 --> 20:38.671
but you know
how delicate these matters are.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.441
- Thank you.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.447
- Dr. Rhodes?

20:50.750 --> 20:51.884
Be careful.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.562
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.764
- Still no sparkly
on the finger.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.032
Does that mean
you made a decision?

21:06.065 --> 21:07.634
- Not yet.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.836
- April, the guy proposed
two months ago.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.504
You owe him an answer.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.840
- I know.
It's complicated.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.876
He told me I could quit my job.

21:16.909 --> 21:19.546
I'm worried that means
he thinks I'm a housewife...

21:19.579 --> 21:20.613
I'm not a housewife.

21:20.647 --> 21:24.517
In his house, no less,
the one he shared with his ex.

21:24.551 --> 21:29.055
It's a huge decision.
And it's all happened so fast.

21:29.088 --> 21:32.925
And, of course,
then there's the TB.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.628
I mean, the whole thing
just really makes me anxious.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.499
What?

21:41.668 --> 21:43.536
What are you thinking?

21:43.570 --> 21:46.739
- Anxiety is a powerful emotion.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.509
Would you say that you feel
more nervous

21:49.542 --> 21:52.679
about the situation
or fearful of the future?

21:52.712 --> 21:55.682
- I-I don't know.

21:55.715 --> 21:56.949
Both, I guess.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.585
- How've you been sleeping?

21:58.618 --> 22:00.853
Waking up at night?
Earlier than you'd like?

22:00.887 --> 22:03.690
- What?
- [laughs]

22:03.723 --> 22:04.857
- Oh, my God.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.093
You're shrinking me.

22:07.126 --> 22:10.563
Three weeks in psych,
and she's Freud.

22:10.597 --> 22:11.764
- What?

22:11.798 --> 22:13.766
She said "anxious"
and "worried."

22:13.800 --> 22:16.035
Those are emotions
that convey distress.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.806
- Meigs Field is beautiful.

22:19.839 --> 22:23.676
The sun reflects off the water
with the blues and the greens,

22:23.710 --> 22:24.911
and the luminescence...

22:24.944 --> 22:26.045
- How you doing there,
Mr. McGregor?

22:26.078 --> 22:28.515
- Hey, Dr. Charles, how are you?

22:28.548 --> 22:30.717
- Who you, um...
who are you talking to?

22:30.750 --> 22:31.851
- It was the nurse, yeah.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.787
She mentioned how she walks
her dog along the lakefront.

22:34.821 --> 22:35.788
Took off from there.

22:35.822 --> 22:36.689
Let me tell you something,
doctor.

22:36.723 --> 22:39.726
There was a time
I used to hate hospitals.

22:39.759 --> 22:43.663
But that's before
I noticed the details.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.766
The staff floating through
the halls like angels...

22:46.799 --> 22:48.835
There! [stammers]
Do you see that?

22:48.868 --> 22:51.671
White light surrounding.
Oh!

22:51.704 --> 22:53.573
Beautiful aura.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.677
- You know, I missed
the beginning.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.979
You were talking about
your favorite spot.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.548
Where was that?

23:01.581 --> 23:03.816
- South end of Meigs Field.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.084
- You excuse me one second?

23:05.117 --> 23:08.788
- Absolutely.
I'm here if you need me.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.192
- Mr. McGregor get
his antipsychotics yet?

23:13.225 --> 23:16.028
- Yes.
2 milligrams of Risperidone.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.730
Little over three hours ago.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.099
- You'd think it'd be making
a dent in his symptoms by now.

23:20.132 --> 23:23.102
Not really happening.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.938
Give me a shout
when the CT results come in.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.874
- You got it.

23:33.813 --> 23:34.981
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

23:35.014 --> 23:36.983
- Sure.
- Not here.

23:40.186 --> 23:44.123
What? No! No!
Absolutely not.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.225
I'm still working
on a diagnosis.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.595
What you're asking me to do
is premature

23:48.628 --> 23:50.129
and completely unethical.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.031
- Natalie, please.

23:52.064 --> 23:55.001
You're running a cerebral
blood flow test for Alicia.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.670
You clearly think brain death
is a possibility.

23:57.704 --> 23:58.638
- A possibility.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.740
But I will not get
those test results back

24:00.773 --> 24:01.874
for another few hours.

24:01.908 --> 24:05.211
- So all I'm asking is that you
speak to Alicia's family

24:05.244 --> 24:06.879
about organ donation.

24:06.913 --> 24:10.116
Look, just let me run
an HLA test.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.685
Just to see if she's a match,

24:12.719 --> 24:15.888
just in--
should the worst happen.

24:19.058 --> 24:23.029
- Okay, you know that

24:23.062 --> 24:24.964
if I do that,

24:24.997 --> 24:28.134
I'm insinuating to her parents
that she's definitely gone.

24:31.170 --> 24:34.774
You are putting me
in a terrible position.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.477
- You're right.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.487
When Tim was born,
he wasn't breathing.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.959
I performed his first surgery.

24:55.728 --> 25:00.032
When he came to,
I was the first person he saw.

25:00.066 --> 25:03.870
And he put his hand
around my finger.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.108
Please, Nat.

25:09.141 --> 25:12.044
I-I can't lose this kid.

25:12.078 --> 25:16.916
*

25:16.949 --> 25:20.286
- So, it's about 2:00
in the morning, pitch black out.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.722
We start taking fire.
Small arms.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.090
Just a few bad guys.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.993
One of our guys drops
into a wadi for cover.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.928
Wham.
Gets hit right in the foot.

25:28.961 --> 25:29.929
- Oh, man.

25:29.962 --> 25:33.232
- When I get to him
he's writhing in agony.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.935
I shine my light on his boot,

25:35.968 --> 25:38.137
see two tiny puncture wounds.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.939
- So what was going on?

25:39.972 --> 25:43.109
- Slowly, I light up the wadi,

25:43.142 --> 25:47.146
and right there,
staring back at me, is a cobra.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.948
- Get the hell out.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.850
- Hood flared.
Ready to strike again.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.119
- Man, that's insane.

25:53.152 --> 25:56.255
- We just heard.
Our banger, Marco?

25:56.288 --> 25:58.357
CT chest showed the bullet
isn't in the midline

25:58.390 --> 26:00.026
or touching the aorta.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.028
It's in the left
paraspinal muscles.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.129
- Surgeon gonna go in
and get it?

26:03.162 --> 26:04.831
- No.
Says it's harmless.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.265
Safer just to leave it there.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.567
Should be as good as new
in a few days.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.773
- And back on the street.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.341
- Yeah.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.009
- Snakes here too.

26:19.912 --> 26:23.015
- Organ donation?

26:23.049 --> 26:25.017
So Alicia's brain dead?

26:25.051 --> 26:26.853
- The test results
have not come back yet.

26:26.886 --> 26:30.389
- Then why are you even here
asking us to cut up our baby?

26:30.422 --> 26:31.791
- No, that's not
what I'm saying.

26:31.824 --> 26:34.026
- Have you given up on her?
- No!

26:34.060 --> 26:35.194
No, I swear,

26:35.227 --> 26:38.898
I'm doing everything in my power
to diagnose your daughter.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.032
- I don't believe this!

26:40.066 --> 26:42.034
Alicia's life is hanging
in the balance,

26:42.068 --> 26:44.036
our baby girl!
- Andre, just--

26:44.070 --> 26:46.172
- She's saying there's no hope.

26:46.205 --> 26:49.375
But there is.
Alicia is still alive.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.943
She's supposed to be our doctor.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.780
- Mr. James, please.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.215
I know that
this is difficult to process,

26:56.248 --> 26:59.051
but the reality is,

26:59.085 --> 27:01.854
we don't know what
the test results are gonna say

27:01.888 --> 27:05.324
and right now there's a baby
fighting to survive,

27:05.357 --> 27:07.860
a baby just like Alicia.

27:07.894 --> 27:10.863
[melancholy music]

27:10.897 --> 27:17.937
*

27:18.404 --> 27:20.339
- What would it require?

27:20.372 --> 27:23.075
- We already have
Alicia's blood.

27:23.109 --> 27:26.145
All I'm asking is that
you allow us to test it.

27:42.461 --> 27:42.594
.

27:43.830 --> 27:44.263
[indistinct chatter]

27:49.335 --> 27:51.303
- Alicia's a match.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.773
- Yeah.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.776
[melancholy music]

27:56.809 --> 28:00.479
*

28:00.512 --> 28:02.314
I know this wasn't easy.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.318
Thank you.

28:06.352 --> 28:10.890
*

28:10.923 --> 28:12.925
- You know, as a doctor,

28:12.959 --> 28:17.296
you want to do everything in
your power to save your patient.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.832
And I am.

28:19.866 --> 28:22.468
But it's just now,

28:22.501 --> 28:26.773
if I save my patient,
it means yours won't make it.

28:26.806 --> 28:33.846
*

28:44.090 --> 28:46.926
- Mr. McGregor
has a pituitary tumor.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.460
- A big one.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.496
- Appears to be pressing
on the optic chiasm.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.765
Which, if his vision
is impaired,

28:52.799 --> 28:54.834
could explain why he fell.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.235
- How long do you think
it's been there?

28:56.268 --> 28:59.505
- Based on the size, a decade.
Maybe even longer.

28:59.538 --> 29:00.506
- Huh.

29:00.539 --> 29:03.342
Meigs Field
was torn down in '03.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.778
In '04, Sammy Sosa
and Moises Alou

29:05.812 --> 29:07.914
were still fixtures
at Wrigley.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.882
The restaurant where
the quinceaÃ±era took place

29:09.916 --> 29:12.985
was still open for business.

29:13.019 --> 29:17.089
All the while, Mr. McGregor's
tumor is likely growing.

29:17.123 --> 29:20.392
Putting pressure
on his optic chiasm.

29:23.896 --> 29:30.469
*

29:30.502 --> 29:33.339
- He's still really congested.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.275
Order a chest X-ray and give him
5 milligrams of Lasix

29:36.308 --> 29:38.845
to try and clear
some of the fluid.

29:40.412 --> 29:44.050
- Dr. Rhodes, it seems like he's
getting worse pretty quickly.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.487
Is he gonna make it
to the transplant?

29:52.925 --> 29:55.995
Do you know what we did
last month?

29:56.028 --> 29:59.465
We bought a car seat.

29:59.498 --> 30:03.836
We were so sure that we were
gonna beat the PICU,

30:03.870 --> 30:06.005
finally take our baby boy home.

30:08.474 --> 30:12.044
- The fight is not over yet.

30:12.078 --> 30:14.981
The important thing
for you right now

30:15.014 --> 30:17.049
is to try and stay
in the present.

30:17.083 --> 30:22.989

30:23.022 --> 30:24.891
[alarm blares]
- What do we got?

30:24.924 --> 30:27.026
- Joy Billings,
44 year old female.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.995
Triple zero. GSW to the chest.

30:29.028 --> 30:32.431
18 gauge IV in the right AC.
No drugs given per protocol.

30:32.464 --> 30:33.599
- Baghdad's alive!
- Down time?

30:33.632 --> 30:35.167
- Roughly eight minutes.
- What happened?

30:35.201 --> 30:36.235
- Watching TV with her kids.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.871
Rival gangs start blasting
at each other outside.

30:38.905 --> 30:41.607
Stray bullet
ripped into the house.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.009
- All right,
let's move her on my count.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.978
Ready, one, two, three.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.613
- Call the blood bank.

- Yeah.

from this morning, Marco.

- Breath sounds bilaterally.
- She's lost a lot of blood.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.193
- Trigger the MTP. Hang blood
on the rapid transfuser.

31:01.227 --> 31:02.561
Maggie,
need a trauma surgeon now.

31:02.594 --> 31:03.896
- She's in the OR.
Three minutes.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.064
- That's too long.
Chest tray.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.465
- You're gonna cut her open?

31:09.135 --> 31:10.469
- First incision.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.608
Second incision.

31:16.642 --> 31:23.882
*

31:32.691 --> 31:35.561
Corpsman, need you to take over
so I can cross clamp her aorta.

31:35.594 --> 31:36.462
- Yes, sir.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.499
- Back and forth
as if you were clapping.

[somber music]

32:51.337 --> 32:58.577
*

33:09.288 --> 33:11.623
- Dr. Rhodes?

33:11.657 --> 33:14.560
Is there a donor
in the hospital for Timmy?

33:14.593 --> 33:16.495
We heard a rumor.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.630
It's her child, isn't it?

33:18.664 --> 33:21.033
Her little girl?

33:21.067 --> 33:22.268
They're the only new patients
on the floor.

33:22.301 --> 33:24.036
We've been here for eight
months; we know everybody else.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.537
It has to be her.
- I'm sorry, Gayle.

33:25.571 --> 33:28.574
But HIPAA regulations
won't allow me

33:28.607 --> 33:31.277
to discuss another patient.

33:51.163 --> 33:51.363
- Hi.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.202
The spinal tap was clean.

33:56.235 --> 33:57.603
I've ruled out
all the common causes.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.505
We must be looking
at something rare.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.273
Have you had
any foreign visitors?

34:01.307 --> 34:03.309
Anyone outside
of your normal social circle?

34:03.342 --> 34:04.643
- No.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.079
- Has your house been sprayed
with pesticides?

34:07.113 --> 34:10.482
- No, none of that.
Nothing. No.

34:10.516 --> 34:11.750
- I'd like to reach out
to toxicology--

34:11.783 --> 34:14.520
- Would you look at them over
there, watching like vultures!

34:14.553 --> 34:16.288
Why don't they show
some damn respect!

34:16.322 --> 34:17.356
- Andre.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.362
- My fault, son.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.464
I shouldn't have shouted.

34:25.496 --> 34:29.534
- Mr. and Mrs. James,
I'm so sorry you're going...

34:31.469 --> 34:35.206
Those...those grass stains.

34:35.241 --> 34:36.641
When you take the boys
to the park,

34:36.675 --> 34:38.476
what do you do with Alicia?

34:38.510 --> 34:42.481
- I lay her down on her stomach
for tummy time.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.283
- You know what?

34:44.315 --> 34:46.418
I'd like to consult
with infectious diseases.

34:46.452 --> 34:48.320
Excuse me, please.

34:48.353 --> 34:54.393
*

34:54.426 --> 34:55.561
- Pupils are reactive.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.564
Mr. McGregor, can you follow
the light with your eyes?

35:03.335 --> 35:04.603
How 'bout now?

35:07.706 --> 35:11.643
Mr. McGregor, how many fingers
am I holding up?

35:11.677 --> 35:13.479
- Three.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.583
- And now?

35:17.616 --> 35:20.286
- One.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.188
- Good job.
I'll be right back.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.394
- Legally blind?

35:28.427 --> 35:30.762
- He can detect sharp lights
and block images,

35:30.796 --> 35:32.698
probably how he made out
my size earlier.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.766
But anything
more than a few feet away

35:34.800 --> 35:37.169
is likely just a blur.

35:37.203 --> 35:39.571
- His pituitary tumor,
is it operable?

35:39.605 --> 35:42.674
- I'll have neuro consult, but
I suspect it's a prolactinoma.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.577
If so, medication alone
should shrink it enough

35:45.611 --> 35:47.613
to ease the pressure
on the optic chiasm.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.615
- So he's gonna get
some of his sight back.

35:51.417 --> 35:54.620
- 15 years.
Homeless, essentially blind.

35:54.653 --> 35:55.621
I mean, that's a crap hand.

35:55.654 --> 35:59.291
He should be pissed.
Yet, he's happy as can be.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.496
Crazy I got this patient today.

36:04.530 --> 36:07.366
- My experience,
we get the patients we need.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.340
- You've created a monster,
you know that?

36:14.373 --> 36:15.807
Turns out,
the English language

36:15.841 --> 36:17.676
is primarily comprised
of buzzwords

36:17.709 --> 36:19.411
for borderline
personality disorders.

36:19.445 --> 36:22.248
Now that I know them,
I can't have a conversation

36:22.281 --> 36:24.416
without immediately
seeing the psych in people,

36:24.450 --> 36:26.418
which is clearly
an impulsive reaction,

36:26.452 --> 36:28.520
which, by the way,
could also suggest

36:28.554 --> 36:30.422
a borderline
personality disorder.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.691
I mean, I can't even
not analyze myself.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.361
Now I'm using double negatives.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.762
- You're a first year
psych resident.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.565
Compulsive diagnosing
is par for the course.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.468
My first year, I was convinced
that a friend of mine

36:42.501 --> 36:44.803
had dissociative
identity disorder

36:44.836 --> 36:47.806
because suddenly he would
only listen to Euro-Disco.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.276
Really.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.777
My advice:

36:51.810 --> 36:54.580
think less, listen more.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.315
You'll be just fine.

37:00.819 --> 37:04.490
- Sir, just wanted
to thank you for today.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.624
- My pleasure.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.326
- I'm spent.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.428
Not gonna be easy over there.

37:09.461 --> 37:10.796
- You'll get through it.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.798
- The medicine, sure.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.467
The rest...

37:15.501 --> 37:18.904
well, I just hope can handle
my emotions as well as you.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.811
- Good luck.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.814
[instrumental music]

37:28.847 --> 37:32.818
*

37:32.851 --> 37:34.820
- Botulism?
Isn't that a food thing?

37:34.853 --> 37:36.455
- I'm still breastfeeding.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.458
- Most cases actually
come from contaminated soil.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.560
It can be absorbed
through the skin.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.430
- The park. Tummy time.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.697
- Is it treatable?

37:45.731 --> 37:47.399
- Yes. Yes.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.501
We will start Alicia
on an antitoxin

37:49.535 --> 37:52.738
that will provide antibodies
to stop the disease's progress.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.441
- But what about the vent?

37:55.474 --> 37:57.376
- The neurotoxin
from the bacteria

37:57.409 --> 37:58.910
is what caused
the muscle weakness.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.580
I believe
she'll make a full recovery.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.915
- Thank you so much, doctor.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.354

38:20.766 --> 38:22.701

- Hey.

38:22.734 --> 38:23.835
What's it this time?

38:23.869 --> 38:25.737
- Gout.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.706
- Ah. May I?

38:31.443 --> 38:32.578
- What do you think?

38:32.611 --> 38:36.982
- An explosion
of brilliant crystals

38:37.015 --> 38:39.851
like Hawaiian shave ice.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.820
- Hm.

38:41.853 --> 38:44.590
- I know how you pathologists
love food references.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.858
- Yes, we do.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.397
- Yeah, uh...okay.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.400
No, I-I understand.

38:54.433 --> 38:55.967
Thanks for your time,
Dr. Laurel.

39:00.639 --> 39:01.907
Damn it.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.851
- It's gonna come through.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.556
- How do you do it?

39:19.458 --> 39:21.660
They're just babies.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.962
- Well...

39:23.995 --> 39:27.666
on rough days, I call Helen.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.502
Ask her to watch Owen
for a few extra hours

39:30.536 --> 39:32.871
while I do something
to decompress.

39:32.904 --> 39:36.608
A good meal, a long walk.

39:36.642 --> 39:40.912
Just something
to let my emotions settle.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.954
I find a safe space.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.632
See you tomorrow.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.468
- Night.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.841
- Hey.
How'd the rest of your day go?

40:09.875 --> 40:12.778
- Not so sure
I want to talk about work.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.547
- Yeah, I may have overstepped
a little bit earlier.

40:15.581 --> 40:18.850
- So you were analyzing me?
- Unintentionally, though.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.820
I'll make it up to you
with burgers at Au Cheval?

40:21.853 --> 40:23.789
You can tell me all about
how the Bears are doing.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.657
- But you know nothing
about football.

40:25.691 --> 40:26.958
- Exactly.
