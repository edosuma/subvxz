00:16.416 --> 00:18.250
<i>Gandía was an animal.</i>

00:19.208 --> 00:22.958
<i>He could've taken shelter in his den</i>
<i>after hurting two of his prey,</i>

00:26.291 --> 00:28.791
<i>but that would've gone</i>
<i>against his nature.</i>

00:33.791 --> 00:35.208
<i>He was a predator.</i>

00:35.541 --> 00:39.208
<i>And he wasn't going to stop</i>
<i>until he'd finished off the whole flock.</i>

00:49.375 --> 00:50.250
Nairobi.

00:50.791 --> 00:51.666
Fuck!

00:51.916 --> 00:54.041
Rio, Denver, come with me, now.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.541
This links to the bathroom below.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.000
Denver, are you up to crawling in there?

01:02.083 --> 01:03.291
-Sure.
-I'll go too.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.208
Go kill that son of a bitch.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.083
Let's go.

01:40.541 --> 01:42.000
Don't move or I'll kill her!

02:23.625 --> 02:26.458
-Stay still all of you!
-Where did he shoot you?

02:27.541 --> 02:28.583
In my hand.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.666
The next one goes in her head!

03:40.041 --> 03:43.250
-Merry Christmas!
-Why "Merry Christmas"?

03:43.333 --> 03:45.708
This feels a bit like Christmas, right?

03:45.791 --> 03:48.416
Here we are, setting the table...

03:48.833 --> 03:50.458
the family is coming...

03:50.541 --> 03:53.666
Family? It's the support team:
Manila, the foundry workers...

03:53.750 --> 03:56.416
-But it's good to get to know one another.
-Yeah.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.625
They're like distant cousins.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.208
Know why I came back for this heist?

04:06.125 --> 04:08.916
Before you scattered us
all across the globe,

04:09.458 --> 04:13.125
this gang
was the closest thing to a family

04:13.208 --> 04:14.708
I've ever had.

04:15.833 --> 04:19.375
I've never had a Christmas
like the ones you see in commercials

04:19.458 --> 04:22.291
with the grandma
and the <i>turrón</i> and all that.

04:22.375 --> 04:24.666
-With Axel's dad, didn't you celebrate--
-No.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.041
You know? I...

04:38.833 --> 04:40.500
I had already given up on...

04:43.500 --> 04:46.000
having a family. Completely.

04:48.083 --> 04:51.291
But now I think
there's another way of doing things.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.875
I really want to be a mother.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.833
Do it differently than before,
and have a bunch of kids

04:57.916 --> 04:59.875
and a dog and whatever else.

04:59.958 --> 05:02.500
What you're saying is beautiful, Nairobi.

05:07.416 --> 05:08.291
Would you...?

05:11.708 --> 05:13.791
Would you be the father of my child?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.000
-Look.
-Sorry?

05:17.708 --> 05:20.916
Genetics are very important.

05:22.375 --> 05:23.583
I see you in class,

05:24.291 --> 05:25.166
and I think...

05:26.958 --> 05:28.500
"What a brilliant man.

05:29.041 --> 05:30.333
He's so honorable.

05:30.833 --> 05:33.041
So sensitive. So handsome.

05:34.041 --> 05:35.541
And he has principles."

05:37.208 --> 05:39.125
I believe in what you want to do.

05:40.583 --> 05:43.291
That's very flattering.

05:44.666 --> 05:48.333
And as for honorable...
well, that's one way of seeing it.

05:48.416 --> 05:52.291
But... you're asking the impossible.

05:52.375 --> 05:55.041
Why? Robbing the Bank of Spain
is impossible.

05:55.625 --> 05:58.458
I'm not asking you to act like a dad,
unless you want to.

05:58.541 --> 06:00.875
I'm asking you for a donation

06:01.291 --> 06:03.375
so I can do things differently.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.500
-No strings attached.
-Nairobi.

06:07.583 --> 06:11.166
Look, I set up the Royal Mint heist

06:11.250 --> 06:12.750
in my father's memory.

06:13.583 --> 06:18.666
I've set up this one in my brother's.
I'm not the type to let go of attachments.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I'd never be able to stop thinking

06:22.083 --> 06:25.208
that I have a child out there,
somewhere in the world.

06:26.375 --> 06:27.666
-OK.
-I'm sorry.

06:29.166 --> 06:32.791
<i>You </i>set this family up,
and <i>you</i> taught us

06:32.875 --> 06:35.625
to do anything for each other.

06:35.708 --> 06:39.541
-But what you're asking--
-What I'm asking you is the same.

06:39.625 --> 06:42.916
Family members help each other,
no questions asked.

06:43.708 --> 06:46.416
Because it makes you happy
and your life depends on it.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.416
You have your plan, I know.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.625
Well, I have one, too.

06:52.666 --> 06:55.250
You've taught me that we help each other.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.791
That's who we are.

07:02.416 --> 07:03.583
Ágata.

07:15.375 --> 07:19.791
-I've asked more difficult things of you.
-Well, a bit more, yeah.

07:20.458 --> 07:24.958
And... I've entered the lion's den,
no questions asked.

07:25.041 --> 07:28.666
I know. I've asked you to do
some very risky things.

07:29.541 --> 07:30.416
Very risky.

07:31.708 --> 07:33.750
Riskier than what you're asking.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.083
Is that a yes?

07:38.916 --> 07:40.916
That's a yes.

07:43.583 --> 07:45.583
Oh, my God!

07:46.833 --> 07:47.750
Come here.

07:49.958 --> 07:52.125
Thank you.

07:53.583 --> 07:56.791
I swear, you'll never regret it.

07:56.958 --> 08:00.000
We'll find the best IVF clinic
in the world.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.791
Or we can do it the natural way.

08:02.875 --> 08:05.666
-The natural way is out of the question.
-Fine.

08:05.750 --> 08:08.250
-We'll leave it to the professionals.
-OK.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.541
And once the heist is over.

08:11.208 --> 08:12.250
OK.

08:14.708 --> 08:16.375
This is going to be amazing.

08:26.916 --> 08:29.166
You're doing really well, mutt.

08:31.708 --> 08:33.333
You look like Jesus Christ.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.375
-How's your hand? Does it hurt?
-I'm loaded with morphine.

08:43.458 --> 08:46.958
-Did you find Tokyo?
<i>-</i>He still has her in the panic room.

08:54.666 --> 08:56.375
We're making a lot of noise.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.166
Let's take our boots off.

09:21.916 --> 09:23.000
What was that?

09:41.083 --> 09:42.041
No.

09:45.583 --> 09:46.541
Shit.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.375
Move!

09:57.458 --> 09:58.625
Rio, Denver, you OK?

09:59.750 --> 10:00.875
We have cover.

10:02.416 --> 10:04.333
You can't escape.

10:04.416 --> 10:07.250
Who says I want to escape,
you one-eyed queer?

10:07.708 --> 10:09.833
All the fun is in here.

10:09.916 --> 10:12.166
How many magazines do you have left?

10:12.250 --> 10:14.875
Why don't you come in here and count them?

10:25.083 --> 10:28.166
Bring the drills.
Start drilling holes in the wall.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.083
For each hole,
I'll make another one in you.

10:36.458 --> 10:37.791
He won't touch me.

10:38.791 --> 10:40.250
If he kills me, you kill him.

10:40.333 --> 10:43.666
-And he knows it.
-She's right. We have a chance.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.583
He'll keep shooting her. It's too risky.

10:47.458 --> 10:48.708
Gandía!

10:49.916 --> 10:51.416
Do you know what?

10:52.875 --> 10:55.666
You're going to be killed by two queers.

10:56.375 --> 11:00.458
What's worse? Being killed by the Serbian
or the one-eyed Argentinian?

11:01.791 --> 11:04.250
Helsinki,
promise you'll kill this bastard.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.666
I promise, Nairobi. I swear I will.

11:06.750 --> 11:10.083
What will your friends
at the shooting club say, Gandía?

11:10.166 --> 11:13.125
You're gonna get killed by a little bear.

11:13.208 --> 11:14.875
Nairobi, save your strength.

11:14.958 --> 11:18.666
You're making my hostage nervous.
And I want her calm.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.208
So we're going to sing.

11:20.291 --> 11:23.083
I want to hear everyone
so I know where you are.

11:23.166 --> 11:26.583
For each person I can't hear singing,
I'll shoot.

11:26.666 --> 11:28.750
Right, Nairobi? Come on, you start.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.541
Do you know "Lord, You Have Come"?

11:33.291 --> 11:35.791
Stop fucking kicking me, for fuck's sake!

11:35.875 --> 11:36.958
Sing!

11:37.291 --> 11:38.250
Sing.

11:38.958 --> 11:39.916
<i>You</i>

11:40.791 --> 11:44.458
<i>Have come to the shore</i>

11:44.541 --> 11:45.583
Come on!

11:47.750 --> 11:50.500
<i>Neither searching for</i>

11:50.583 --> 11:52.291
<i>The wise</i>

11:52.375 --> 11:54.916
<i>Nor the rich</i>

11:55.000 --> 11:58.791
I told you to sing!
And anyone who doesn't know it, hum!

11:58.875 --> 12:03.000
<i>Desiring only</i>

12:03.083 --> 12:07.083
<i>That I should follow you</i>

12:08.583 --> 12:10.541
<i>Oh, Lord</i>

12:10.625 --> 12:15.166
<i>With your eyes set upon me</i>

12:16.666 --> 12:18.125
I can't hear the choir!

12:18.208 --> 12:21.250
<i>I left my boat</i>

12:21.375 --> 12:25.833
<i>On the shore</i>

12:26.375 --> 12:29.458
<i>At your side</i>

12:29.833 --> 12:33.958
<i>I will seek another sea</i>

12:34.041 --> 12:38.833
<i>I will seek another sea</i>

12:41.041 --> 12:43.375
<i>That song had a funeral vibe to it.</i>

12:44.291 --> 12:46.583
<i>Our own funeral.</i>

12:47.666 --> 12:49.750
<i>And that slap of reality</i>

12:49.833 --> 12:51.708
<i>began to wake up the Professor.</i>

12:53.000 --> 12:54.666
We're up against the ropes.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.791
Nairobi, TKO.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.291
Tokyo, TKO.

13:01.458 --> 13:03.375
Lisbon, TKO.

13:06.916 --> 13:07.958
Professor.

13:08.583 --> 13:12.208
I can't think.
I have too many emotional attachments.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.958
I used to have
a gang with city names. Now...

13:16.000 --> 13:20.291
now I could have a child,
not with one, but with two of the gang.

13:21.125 --> 13:24.375
Mixing professional
and personal doesn't work.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.500
Tokyo is in the panic room.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.041
And that's precisely where...

13:29.708 --> 13:31.083
Gandía...

13:31.625 --> 13:33.625
wants to get to.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.916
We have to find the room
and ensure there's no way out.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Where would you put a panic room?

13:44.083 --> 13:46.791
A place you need to protect.
Where the gold is.

13:46.875 --> 13:47.791
No.

13:48.333 --> 13:53.125
Panic rooms protect lives, not gold.
Whose life is most important there?

13:53.208 --> 13:55.333
-The governor's.
-Exactly.

13:55.666 --> 13:58.250
It must be close to the governor's office.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.708
But why isn't it in the blueprints?

14:00.791 --> 14:03.083
-Perhaps they renovated.
-No.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.791
Palermo, don't answer.

14:17.458 --> 14:20.250
<i>The panic room's</i>
<i>behind the governor's bathroom.</i>

14:20.333 --> 14:22.333
<i>It's not in the blueprints.</i>

14:22.416 --> 14:26.083
They must have falsified
the room measurements, but trust me.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.375
I'm sure.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.333
They're singing hymns.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.375
That's a bad omen, right?

14:38.458 --> 14:41.583
These people are eccentric like that.

14:41.666 --> 14:44.083
However, those shots before...

14:45.125 --> 14:49.125
could mean the gang is in dire straits,
don't you reckon, Governor?

14:49.208 --> 14:50.500
How would you know?

14:52.500 --> 14:56.000
I don't know.
The shouting, the grenades...

14:56.125 --> 14:58.291
Also, that guy watching us...

14:58.375 --> 15:02.375
I have no fucking clue who he is,
but he doesn't belong to the gang.

15:02.458 --> 15:06.875
We should take advantage of this situation
and tip the scales in our favor.

15:06.958 --> 15:10.583
Even a small push
could mean victory for us.

15:11.416 --> 15:12.875
And if I may, Governor,

15:12.958 --> 15:16.666
I think that small push
is our responsibility: yours and mine.

15:17.750 --> 15:22.250
We must be the ones
to save all these people.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.375
What we must do

15:24.458 --> 15:26.875
is remain calm and wait.

15:26.958 --> 15:30.333
Quiet! If you so much as sigh again,
I'll start shooting.

15:31.625 --> 15:34.500
I'm sorry to disagree with you, Governor,

15:34.583 --> 15:36.500
but it's your responsibility.

15:36.583 --> 15:39.333
You are the governor of the Bank of Spain.

15:39.583 --> 15:42.291
It's your responsibility as a man,
damn it.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.416
Make some decisions, face the problems.

15:45.541 --> 15:51.208
As I always say... sometimes it's better
to get up and die on your feet

15:51.291 --> 15:54.500
than to live forever on your knees.

15:57.541 --> 16:00.000
-Know what I think?
-Tell me.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.500
You're a clown.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.833
You put us all at risk
with your little walks

16:05.916 --> 16:08.625
and your snake-oil salesman spiel.

16:09.750 --> 16:10.833
Leave us in peace.

16:11.625 --> 16:15.500
If you want to die on your feet,
get up and do it.

16:23.375 --> 16:26.416
Grenades, shooting...

16:26.833 --> 16:28.250
All that in six minutes.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.833
And here you are, so calm.
What am I missing?

16:31.916 --> 16:34.250
-I know the same as you, Alicia.
-Liar.

16:34.625 --> 16:37.166
-What's going on in there?
-I don't know.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.875
Why don't we intervene?

16:38.958 --> 16:42.458
If shots are heard,
protocol says we should intervene.

16:46.666 --> 16:47.708
It's Gandía,

16:47.791 --> 16:49.666
-the head of security.
-Shit.

16:49.750 --> 16:52.875
He's on the loose,
armed and acting of his own accord.

16:52.958 --> 16:55.458
Wait a minute. Did you talk to him?

16:57.791 --> 17:01.125
Did you give him the green light
to wage war and kill everyone?

17:01.208 --> 17:03.458
I officially ordered him not to do it.

17:03.541 --> 17:06.458
He said balls to that,
he'd do it in self-defense.

17:06.541 --> 17:09.500
If he wants to defend himself,
I can't stop him.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.208
You're trash, Tamayo.

17:11.291 --> 17:15.833
Out there, you're a saint,
worried about your public image,

17:15.916 --> 17:17.583
holding an absurd truce,

17:17.666 --> 17:20.583
while you send a lunatic
to do the dirty work.

17:20.666 --> 17:23.833
If it goes well, you'll take the credit.
If not, you'll say,

17:23.916 --> 17:26.291
"I told him, but he was a nutcase."

17:26.375 --> 17:28.833
Us nutcases always do your dirty work.

17:28.916 --> 17:32.291
Do you have a problem
with Gandía waging a guerrilla war?

17:32.375 --> 17:35.416
Or with him sabotaging,
injuring, or killing them?

17:35.500 --> 17:36.583
You don't, right?

17:37.166 --> 17:38.916
Then keep your mouth shut.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.708
Are you thinking?

17:45.791 --> 17:47.208
Yes, I'm thinking.

17:49.041 --> 17:53.083
-What about?
-When was the first time we lost control?

17:54.166 --> 17:56.791
<i>When Gandía didn't go out</i>
<i>with the red boxes.</i>

17:58.125 --> 18:00.208
-The second time?
-<i>I have a problem.</i>

18:02.000 --> 18:05.250
When Lisbon couldn't climb the tree.

18:05.333 --> 18:08.791
Those two mistakes
have put us up against the ropes.

18:10.916 --> 18:14.083
And we need to go back...

18:17.125 --> 18:18.750
and undo them.

18:18.833 --> 18:22.000
I need to exercise to clear my head.
Palermo.

18:23.541 --> 18:25.125
Hold on, you hear me?

18:26.708 --> 18:27.541
<i>Hold on.</i>

18:38.333 --> 18:39.750
Fucking hell!

18:47.000 --> 18:48.416
Mr. Arturo.

18:51.083 --> 18:54.125
I've got something
that may help with that push.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.333
What?

18:55.916 --> 18:58.083
-A phone.
-Hide it.

18:58.166 --> 19:00.916
It's Nairobi's.
The one the police sent in.

19:07.416 --> 19:08.875
I found it while cleaning.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.083
You'll know what to do with it.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.083
What the fuck's going on there?

19:16.166 --> 19:18.666
If I hear so much as a sigh,
I'll shoot.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.916
Sir, I need to use the bathroom. Now.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.583
Now's not the time.

19:29.666 --> 19:33.000
No one is leaving this place,
so sit down and relax.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.041
After you.

19:52.041 --> 19:53.666
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

19:56.333 --> 20:01.500
-What's going on, Daniel? I was eating--
-No, not Daniel. Here, I'm Denver.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.041
OK? Denver.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.958
I'm sorry,
I'm not used to your new identity.

20:07.750 --> 20:08.875
Well, about that...

20:10.583 --> 20:12.500
There are a few things...

20:13.208 --> 20:16.333
that I'd like to understand,
and it's not easy for me.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.208
Ask away. I'm the same person.

20:20.291 --> 20:23.750
You're not exactly the same person.
You have boobs now.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.375
-Well...
-You have boobs.

20:26.458 --> 20:30.125
-Yes, I do.
-You're a woman, I understand that part.

20:32.208 --> 20:35.291
Are you gay as well? Or how does it work?

20:37.375 --> 20:42.250
So what you're worried about right now
is whether I like men or not, is that it?

20:42.333 --> 20:43.166
Yes.

20:44.375 --> 20:48.250
I like men, to be honest.
I like them very much.

20:48.833 --> 20:51.625
Mind you, not just any type of man.

20:52.125 --> 20:56.083
I like them strong, you know?
The kind that go to the gym.

20:56.166 --> 20:59.750
Tough guys, but well-read too,
so I can learn from them.

21:00.791 --> 21:04.375
The type that watch football.
But in a macho way, you know?

21:04.458 --> 21:08.208
Beer in hand, legs spread wide,
and their hand on their groin.

21:08.291 --> 21:10.000
OK, I get it. It's clear.

21:10.791 --> 21:11.625
But...

21:12.041 --> 21:14.000
have you always liked men?

21:14.416 --> 21:16.791
Or was this
a result of becoming a woman?

21:16.875 --> 21:17.833
First of all,

21:17.916 --> 21:19.666
I've always been a woman.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.333
No.

21:21.416 --> 21:22.875
No, you haven't.

21:22.958 --> 21:25.541
I did robberies with you.
You weren't a woman.

21:25.625 --> 21:28.375
How does a woman rob?
By scratching and pulling hair?

21:28.458 --> 21:29.666
I'm not a caveman.

21:29.750 --> 21:34.583
But, I mean, at the end of the day,
you can spot a woman.

21:34.666 --> 21:37.833
When I did a robbery,
I went with Juanito, not a woman.

21:38.500 --> 21:43.000
Maybe this thing about being a woman...
happened later.

21:45.416 --> 21:46.416
Listen.

21:48.041 --> 21:51.375
Juanito would finish a robbery with you...

21:52.208 --> 21:54.416
and go back home, to his room.

21:55.916 --> 21:57.916
He'd put some music on,

21:58.416 --> 22:00.416
he'd roll a joint,

22:00.708 --> 22:04.416
and he'd put some red lipstick on,
a wonderful lipstick I had.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.666
It was Ferrari red.

22:06.166 --> 22:07.416
He'd take his joint

22:07.500 --> 22:09.333
and lie on the bed.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.416
And right there, in those moments,

22:15.041 --> 22:18.166
all alone, relaxed,
and looking gorgeous...

22:20.500 --> 22:23.541
that was when I was really myself.

22:24.666 --> 22:28.083
-You've always been a woman?
-Always.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.166
And I never noticed?

22:31.250 --> 22:34.541
Do you know who made me
really horny back then?

22:37.541 --> 22:39.458
-Of course I do.
-Really?

22:39.541 --> 22:42.583
David Beckham.
You talked about him all damn day.

22:42.666 --> 22:45.375
Beckham made me horny too,
always has, but no.

22:46.458 --> 22:49.166
You. You turned me on so much.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.875
No, I didn't.

22:54.958 --> 22:58.333
-I was in love with you.
-Don't joke about love.

22:58.416 --> 23:01.708
Why do you think
I followed you around, doing jobs?

23:01.791 --> 23:03.125
To be near you.

23:03.208 --> 23:05.208
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

23:05.291 --> 23:07.291
I used to grope you on the bike.

23:07.375 --> 23:10.708
You didn't notice,
but I'd grab onto your leg and back...

23:10.791 --> 23:13.291
And your scent drove me wild.

23:13.375 --> 23:16.291
Don't you realize this is serious?

23:16.375 --> 23:18.416
You were taking advantage of me.

23:20.333 --> 23:23.541
I'm pulling your leg,
you dickhead. I mean...

23:23.625 --> 23:24.625
Fucking hell.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.291
Give me a hug, come on.

23:40.875 --> 23:43.416
Excuse me, sir,
but I can't wait any longer.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.375
Nobody move!
I don't want to hear a sound!

23:53.750 --> 23:55.708
Miguel, listen.

23:55.791 --> 23:59.000
We need to establish communication
with the outside.

23:59.083 --> 24:00.083
OK?

24:00.750 --> 24:01.666
Here, hide it.

24:02.583 --> 24:05.000
They've got me in their sights. You're OK.

24:12.750 --> 24:15.291
-What are you doing here?
-What the fuck?

24:15.958 --> 24:17.958
What's happening? Where's Denver?

24:18.041 --> 24:19.541
-He's fine.
-Who's there?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.166
-It's a hostage.
-Take her away.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.250
-Come on.
-Like hell, I'm staying.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.166
Give me a gun.

24:26.250 --> 24:28.500
You're not here for this, Manila. Go.

24:28.583 --> 24:30.708
You're in trouble. Give me a gun.

24:34.416 --> 24:36.291
Get out of here right now.

24:36.666 --> 24:37.750
Come on, damn it.

24:38.916 --> 24:39.958
Stay calm.

24:48.333 --> 24:52.208
From now on, you and I will be
the backbone of the resistance.

24:53.333 --> 24:55.208
My mouth went dry just hearing that.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.166
<i>Denver.</i>

25:10.416 --> 25:11.833
<i>It's four seconds at most.</i>

25:13.333 --> 25:15.541
One advances,
the other provides cover fire.

25:15.625 --> 25:16.791
<i>And we save Nairobi.</i>

25:16.875 --> 25:19.583
<i>Tell us what you want, Gandía.</i>
<i>Let's negotiate.</i>

25:19.916 --> 25:22.625
Negotiate?
Look, let me explain the situation.

25:23.125 --> 25:24.125
Option one:

25:24.208 --> 25:27.666
I come out with the gun to Nairobi's head.

25:28.208 --> 25:30.916
You stay up against the right wall.

25:31.416 --> 25:33.416
I let her go, and nobody dies.

25:34.041 --> 25:37.375
It's a good deal for both of us.
Zero-zero. A tie.

25:37.875 --> 25:39.125
Option two:

25:39.708 --> 25:42.375
instead of me coming out, you come in.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.708
I blow Nairobi's head off.

25:45.375 --> 25:46.500
You shoot me.

25:46.750 --> 25:49.375
But I'd still have a free hand
to shoot back,

25:49.458 --> 25:52.458
and I swear,
I'll take out more than one of you.

25:52.541 --> 25:56.041
You forgot option three:
come out on your knees, unarmed.

25:56.125 --> 25:58.291
You surrender and give us Nairobi. 

25:58.375 --> 25:59.958
That's a tie too. How's that?

26:00.041 --> 26:02.583
I won't kneel,
not even before God Almighty.

26:02.666 --> 26:05.666
I'll give you one minute.
Then, I start shooting.

26:05.750 --> 26:07.416
I may well win six-zero.

26:08.583 --> 26:09.916
What an asshole.

26:10.666 --> 26:13.125
Gandía, darling, you couldn't do that.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.041
You're an idiot.

26:15.125 --> 26:19.416
The other day, I turned up with my friend,

26:19.500 --> 26:21.250
and we got you good.

26:21.333 --> 26:22.583
Shut up.

26:22.666 --> 26:27.000
Tokyo really got you with the water trick.

26:27.083 --> 26:28.458
Nairobi, shut up.

26:29.666 --> 26:32.708
-The door handle hit you in the face...
-Shut up.

26:32.791 --> 26:34.458
...and knocked you out.

26:34.541 --> 26:36.458
Why is she doing that?

26:36.541 --> 26:40.791
Where are your macho balls now?

26:41.625 --> 26:44.000
-So clumsy.
-She wants to save Tokyo.

26:44.083 --> 26:45.625
You're useless.

26:46.041 --> 26:48.375
She knows if he kills her, we'll kill him.

26:48.458 --> 26:52.125
You've spent your whole life
waiting for this moment, right?

26:52.208 --> 26:54.583
With your well-trained little soldiers.

26:54.666 --> 26:57.541
And two chicks show up
and get you real good.

26:57.625 --> 27:00.250
-Should I shoot you now?
<i>-</i>Surprise me.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.291
Should I put a bullet in your ass?

27:16.125 --> 27:18.500
We have to get her out now.

27:18.583 --> 27:20.625
If we let him out,

27:20.708 --> 27:23.791
<i>he'll do whatever he wants.</i>
<i>I don't trust him.</i>

27:23.875 --> 27:26.583
-We have to hold on.
-<i>Why do you want to?</i>

27:26.666 --> 27:29.708
She's there because of you.
You freed that butcher.

27:29.791 --> 27:31.375
<i>We have to get her out.</i>

27:31.875 --> 27:33.166
<i>Do you all agree?</i>

27:37.875 --> 27:38.916
OK, Gandía.

27:39.708 --> 27:41.166
We're letting you out.

27:41.541 --> 27:43.041
OK, good.

27:43.416 --> 27:44.708
This is how it'll go:

27:44.791 --> 27:47.208
you'll see Nairobi the whole time.

27:47.291 --> 27:51.291
We'll walk forward with my gun to her head

27:51.375 --> 27:55.333
once she confirms you're all
up against the wall on the right.

27:55.916 --> 27:59.333
Starting with
those two fucking kids up there!

28:01.666 --> 28:04.083
Did you hear that? You have to come down.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.291
OK.

28:18.625 --> 28:22.333
Earlier you asked me
if sleeping with me made my husband sick,

28:22.416 --> 28:23.541
and I didn't reply.

28:24.291 --> 28:26.833
No. I didn't make him sick.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.333
Because I wasn't a bitch then.

28:38.125 --> 28:39.375
But now I am.

28:40.833 --> 28:43.041
And yes, we had sex.

28:43.125 --> 28:44.291
Everywhere.

28:45.625 --> 28:47.625
And highly creative sex.

28:47.916 --> 28:52.500
I guess you and the Professor are
more the type to do it once every 30 days.

28:52.583 --> 28:55.541
Missionary position,
even though you're billionaires.

28:56.291 --> 28:59.958
All that poison inside you
is eating away at you, Alicia.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.208
I can see it in your face.

29:07.250 --> 29:08.625
What's wrong with it?

29:10.166 --> 29:13.458
You're a caricature of yourself,
going on about sex. What's wrong?

29:13.541 --> 29:16.333
Is it the hormones?
Try downloading an app.

29:16.416 --> 29:19.833
There are tons of perverts
who want to fuck pregnant women.

29:19.916 --> 29:21.875
I like to get to know them first.

29:21.958 --> 29:25.000
I don't go off with the first hipster
who comes along,

29:25.083 --> 29:27.041
gives me his number, and says,

29:27.291 --> 29:30.750
"Hey, gorgeous,
why don't you come to my storehouse

29:30.833 --> 29:33.000
to try my cider? It's very tasty."

29:33.083 --> 29:34.083
Know what it is?

29:35.500 --> 29:36.333
No, tell me.

29:36.416 --> 29:38.791
If your mask slips, you crumble.

29:39.958 --> 29:43.333
You're in danger of collapse.
And I get it.

29:45.875 --> 29:47.500
I'm not the one in a mask.

29:48.875 --> 29:52.083
Let's see, earlier, we had a deal.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.291
You were holding the phone,

29:55.125 --> 29:56.291
and you backed out.

29:57.583 --> 29:58.625
What happened?

29:59.666 --> 30:03.083
I made you waste your time
while you were questioning me.

30:03.916 --> 30:06.750
I pretended
you were slowly wearing me down,

30:06.833 --> 30:08.333
that I was giving in.

30:08.416 --> 30:12.000
In the meantime, the Professor
escaped your cordon.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.833
It's called "diversion tactics."

30:14.916 --> 30:16.625
And it worked.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.875
Do you know what I think?

30:21.000 --> 30:24.333
Your little shepherd
somehow made it in time.

30:27.916 --> 30:29.083
I'll find out.

30:30.333 --> 30:31.291
Come on.

30:46.458 --> 30:48.500
<i>-Think.</i>
<i>-I knew we weren't in Spain.</i>

30:50.125 --> 30:54.208
<i>-I could hear the call to prayer.</i>
<i>-Think, you can do it.</i>

30:54.291 --> 30:56.208
<i>Fly with me.</i>

31:06.666 --> 31:07.500
Shakir.

31:08.458 --> 31:09.791
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

31:10.750 --> 31:12.750
Yes, Shakir speaking, Professor.

31:12.833 --> 31:15.458
I need you to track Rio's flight to Spain.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.666
It's a Spanish Air Force
Beechcraft Air King 250.

31:18.750 --> 31:21.333
The flight landed at 16:30 on April 4.

31:21.416 --> 31:24.083
Check all the air navigation satellites.

31:24.166 --> 31:26.708
<i>I need the exact point of origin.</i>

31:32.625 --> 31:33.875
Does it have battery?

31:35.541 --> 31:37.708
-It does.
-And signal?

31:41.500 --> 31:42.833
Yes, sir.

31:42.916 --> 31:44.750
OK, go to the call log.

31:45.583 --> 31:48.875
Miguel, you need to keep a cool head, OK?

31:48.958 --> 31:51.208
They don't suspect you at all.

31:51.291 --> 31:54.083
-Yes, but my fingers are sweating.
-Stay calm.

31:58.791 --> 32:01.916
-There's a call from a hidden number.
-Go to contacts.

32:03.958 --> 32:05.000
There's a number.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.458
Call it.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.375
I hope nobody answers.

32:13.791 --> 32:15.333
It's Nairobi's phone.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.833
-What are you doing?
-I won't talk.

32:19.916 --> 32:21.791
-Fuck.
-They hung up.

32:23.041 --> 32:26.208
I'm leaving my fingerprints.
I'm not calling the cops.

32:26.291 --> 32:27.125
Listen.

32:27.208 --> 32:29.750
You just need to leave the call connected

32:29.833 --> 32:33.166
and hold a normal conversation,
between hostages.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.791
They'll know what to do.

32:36.083 --> 32:36.916
Understood?

32:43.375 --> 32:44.875
They're calling again.

32:45.458 --> 32:47.208
<i>-Speak.</i>
<i>-So...</i>

32:48.916 --> 32:50.166
we're here,

32:50.250 --> 32:51.625
<i>in the library.</i>

32:52.208 --> 32:53.541
<i>All the hostages.</i>

32:53.875 --> 32:57.750
Being watched by just one of the gang,
a guy called Matías.

32:57.833 --> 33:00.708
-Turn the volume up.
-I think it's Arturo Román.

33:00.791 --> 33:02.916
There's no one in the lobby, right?

33:03.208 --> 33:04.208
No one.

33:07.541 --> 33:08.708
I've lost my voice.

33:09.708 --> 33:11.875
And since Gandía is free,

33:11.958 --> 33:14.833
<i>it'd be the perfect time</i>
<i>for the police to go in.</i>

33:15.083 --> 33:18.583
Because, I repeat,
there's no one in the lobby.

33:18.666 --> 33:21.958
<i>They've been decimated.</i>
<i>There have been shots, grenades,</i>

33:22.041 --> 33:24.416
shouting, and hymns, right, Miguel?

33:24.500 --> 33:25.333
That's right.

33:28.625 --> 33:29.458
Sorry.

33:33.208 --> 33:36.833
-We have to go in.
-The Presidency says no more armored vans.

33:36.916 --> 33:40.458
They're looking the other way.
We'll catch them off guard.

33:40.541 --> 33:41.708
I can't.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.208
What the fuck are you doing?

33:44.791 --> 33:47.583
It's this kid.
He's very nervous. He's lost it.

33:47.666 --> 33:49.208
Poor guy, he was praying.

33:49.291 --> 33:51.666
-He seemed... I don't know.
-Come on.

33:53.333 --> 33:56.041
Over here, in silence and close to me.

33:56.708 --> 33:58.625
You, hands where I can see them.

33:58.708 --> 34:03.208
Lower them an inch, and I'll shoot you.
Move an inch, and I'll shoot you.

34:04.166 --> 34:06.458
Say a fucking word...

34:06.541 --> 34:08.666
-And you'll shoot me.
-That's right.

34:08.750 --> 34:11.416
-I might just shoot you anyway.
-Come on.

34:12.041 --> 34:12.916
Behave.

34:16.416 --> 34:20.291
Suárez! Prepare an intervention unit.
We'll go in through the lobby.

34:20.375 --> 34:22.958
Call Gandía in the panic room
to coordinate.

34:23.041 --> 34:25.875
Thank God.
You're finally showing you have balls.

34:38.916 --> 34:39.916
<i>Professor.</i>

34:40.875 --> 34:43.458
<i>The Beechcraft Air King 250</i>

34:43.541 --> 34:47.833
that brought Rio to Spain
took off from Algeria at 15:03 hours,

34:47.916 --> 34:50.041
<i>from a town called Timimoun.</i>

34:50.833 --> 34:53.666
<i>It's in the Atlas Mountains.</i>

34:58.916 --> 34:59.875
Good.

34:59.958 --> 35:03.541
Minutes earlier, they'd have driven him
to the aircraft.

35:03.625 --> 35:04.625
Find that car.

35:05.250 --> 35:07.250
<i>I see it's a desert. No trees.</i>

35:07.333 --> 35:09.625
So you can go back through the images

35:09.708 --> 35:11.833
-to see where the car came from.
-<i>OK.</i>

35:11.916 --> 35:14.000
We'll use the weather satellites.

35:14.083 --> 35:15.000
Very good.

35:22.833 --> 35:25.708
Go to Algeria.
I want you in Timimoun in four hours.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.625
I can't fly with weapons.

35:27.708 --> 35:30.333
I know. You'll get backup once you arrive.

35:30.750 --> 35:32.541
The plan was to not leave you.

35:32.625 --> 35:34.958
The plan has just changed, Marseille.

35:35.041 --> 35:37.750
I need to bring together
the Serbs and Benjamín's team

35:37.833 --> 35:39.250
and go on the offensive.

35:39.333 --> 35:42.041
We'll strike them everywhere,
so hard and fast,

35:42.125 --> 35:44.208
they won't know which way is up.

36:06.041 --> 36:07.041
How are you?

36:08.583 --> 36:09.750
My stitches...

36:11.125 --> 36:12.125
have come undone.

36:14.250 --> 36:15.166
Where is he?

36:15.625 --> 36:16.458
I don't know.

36:17.666 --> 36:18.708
Where is he?

36:22.291 --> 36:23.125
Denver...

36:27.750 --> 36:28.666
I don't know.

36:32.541 --> 36:35.375
We're here, fucking scumbag.

36:36.458 --> 36:37.791
Where's the other one?

36:38.875 --> 36:39.791
I'm here.

36:40.500 --> 36:43.166
Very well.
I'll start cutting Nairobi loose.

36:48.166 --> 36:49.083
Mutt.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.666
Want to say anything before the dance?

36:53.750 --> 36:55.416
No? Well...

37:02.250 --> 37:03.708
-Party time?
-Party time.

37:14.583 --> 37:15.750
Nairobi.

37:15.833 --> 37:16.916
<i>Sleepyhead.</i>

37:18.416 --> 37:20.125
You're brave, asleep up here

37:20.208 --> 37:22.958
with everyone at the table
waiting for you.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.333
Come on, wake up.

37:25.333 --> 37:26.291
Hey.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.458
What?

37:29.250 --> 37:30.625
He said yes.

37:33.875 --> 37:35.000
The Professor.

37:36.750 --> 37:37.916
He said yes.

37:41.666 --> 37:43.875
-You're going to be an aunt!
-An aunt!

37:44.666 --> 37:47.250
-I'm so happy for you.
-I can't believe it.

37:47.541 --> 37:48.416
Hey.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.958
-What?
-You'll have a little genius.

37:51.041 --> 37:53.041
<i>Yes. We're going to name them...</i>

37:55.000 --> 37:55.833
<i>What?</i>

37:58.250 --> 37:59.208
Ibiza.

38:01.458 --> 38:03.458
My God, I love it. Ibiza.

38:03.541 --> 38:04.750
<i>I love it.</i>

38:04.833 --> 38:06.000
<i>Call them Ibiza...</i>

38:07.291 --> 38:09.958
and you know
you'll have so much fun together.

38:10.041 --> 38:12.750
Fuck, they'll be so popular at school.

38:12.833 --> 38:15.125
<i>But it's not a city, it's an island.</i>

38:15.208 --> 38:18.416
Do you know what other rule
we're going to break?

38:18.500 --> 38:19.916
Not seeing each other.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.541
You'll be their aunt.

38:22.583 --> 38:23.958
<i>Look, you know what?</i>

38:24.041 --> 38:25.708
You'll be their godmother.

38:26.708 --> 38:27.541
Yes, darling.

38:29.875 --> 38:32.250
-I'm so looking forward to it.
-So am I.

38:33.583 --> 38:34.541
So am I.

38:38.916 --> 38:40.250
I can't believe it.

38:41.416 --> 38:43.166
What?

38:43.625 --> 38:45.250
-Ibiza, right?
-Of course.

38:45.333 --> 38:48.250
No more spending Christmas
alone with Helsinki.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.541
He doesn't know any Christmas carols.

38:50.625 --> 38:53.833
From now on,
Christmas will be spent with family.

38:53.916 --> 38:56.208
-What's going on?
-What are you doing?

38:56.291 --> 38:59.875
Party for a single mother.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.083
Are you pregnant?

39:02.166 --> 39:06.625
-Yes! No, after the heist.
-I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

39:06.708 --> 39:08.125
Me neither.

39:08.208 --> 39:10.333
-What?
-It's a friend with benefits.

39:10.416 --> 39:12.208
Want to know the baby's name?

39:13.041 --> 39:14.458
-Ibiza!
-Ibiza!

39:27.583 --> 39:29.250
<i>Mutt.</i>

39:39.833 --> 39:42.916
I want you all against the wall.
Lower your weapons.

39:43.916 --> 39:46.000
I'd ask you to put them on the ground,

39:46.083 --> 39:50.250
but I know myself. If I see you unarmed,
I might get carried away.

39:50.333 --> 39:53.000
So let's show some mutual respect.

39:54.625 --> 39:55.458
Lower them.

39:55.541 --> 39:56.791
Come on.

39:58.083 --> 40:00.083
I'm aiming at her head.

40:00.791 --> 40:03.208
I have a bulletproof vest.
She's tied up.

40:03.583 --> 40:05.208
You won't get me.

40:05.291 --> 40:06.583
Come on, let's go.

40:13.333 --> 40:15.250
Lower the fucking gun, idiot!

40:15.333 --> 40:16.583
Didn't you hear me?

40:21.083 --> 40:22.125
That's it.

40:22.833 --> 40:24.833
Slowly.

40:30.208 --> 40:31.708
Shall we dance?

40:31.791 --> 40:33.250
Come on, let's dance.

40:39.083 --> 40:40.583
You're falling, darling.

40:41.083 --> 40:42.416
Sorry.

40:44.125 --> 40:46.666
Look at your big man. Hello, big man.

40:47.416 --> 40:48.416
That's enough.

40:49.416 --> 40:50.583
Let her go now.

40:50.666 --> 40:52.875
Take it easy.

40:53.583 --> 40:55.083
Easy.

40:55.166 --> 40:57.875
I'm about to let her go. Take it easy.

40:57.958 --> 40:59.458
I'm about to let her go.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.041
Here we go.

41:07.916 --> 41:09.041
That's it.

41:20.791 --> 41:21.833
Mutt.

41:30.708 --> 41:32.708
I said I was going to kill you.

41:34.833 --> 41:36.166
No!
