WEBVTT

00:24.285 --> 00:25.938
Ah!

00:25.982 --> 00:27.810
All right.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.377
That's enough of a warm-up.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.988
Warm-up? I thought you said
you wanted a friendly rally.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.078
Well, I thought you said
-you could play tennis.
-Well, you know,

00:35.122 --> 00:36.471
I'm kind of more
of a game-day guy.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.516
I need some stakes
to really elevate my play.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.648
All right, then.

00:39.691 --> 00:41.258
Let's make it interesting.

00:41.302 --> 00:42.694
One game.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.828
Loser buys malasadas
-from Leonard's.
-All right.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.090
You're on.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.114
-Out!
-Yes!

01:11.158 --> 01:13.160
-What?
-It was out.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.249
No, it was clearly on the line.
I-I saw it.

01:15.292 --> 01:18.513
-I can assure you, it was not.
-And I'm supposed
to take your word for it?

01:18.556 --> 01:20.341
Thomas,
I don't need to cheat to win.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.907
I'm just calling it
like I see it.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.387
Now,

01:23.431 --> 01:25.781
are you gonna whine,
or can we be adults about this?

01:28.697 --> 01:29.915
Okay, there it is.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.917
-Clearly in.
-It's not clearly anything.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.354
It's a terrible angle.
The security footage

01:33.397 --> 01:34.659
is inconclusive at best.

01:34.703 --> 01:36.705
Okay, well, we're gonna

01:36.748 --> 01:38.446
have to revisit this.
Our 10:00 a.m. is here.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.404
What 10:00 a.m.?Elena Dunn.

01:40.448 --> 01:41.884
She called
about an hour ago.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.538
It was pretty urgent,
so I put her in the calendar.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.496
Or did you miss that, too?

01:49.152 --> 01:51.589
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.809
I-I didn't know
where else to go.

01:53.852 --> 01:55.376
Well, we're happy to help.

01:55.419 --> 01:58.205
So, uh, why don't you tell us
what's going on, Elena.

01:58.248 --> 02:02.426
Two nights ago,
the man I'd been seeing...

02:03.210 --> 02:05.429
He was murdered.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.825
We're so sorry for your loss.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.480
Why don't you tell us
what happened.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.743
I'm not sure where to begin.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.571
It all happened so fast.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.616
You were there?

02:18.660 --> 02:20.401
I was upstairs
when they broke in.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.185
There were two of them.

02:22.229 --> 02:25.101
They argued with
Jax, then...

02:25.145 --> 02:26.102
they shot him.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.974
There was nothing
I could do.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.715
Do the police have any leads?

02:30.759 --> 02:33.979
I'm not sure
they know he's dead.

02:35.024 --> 02:37.940
-You didn't go to HPD?
-That's why I'm here.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.769
I-I can't go to the police.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.727
This would destroy my family.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.947
I'm not sure that I follow.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.909
I'm married.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.414
<i>Sorry for asking, but is there</i>

03:17.458 --> 03:20.156
any chance your husband, uh,
knew about the affair?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.897
He has no idea.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.769
And, please,
it has to stay that way.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.294
I can understand the
need for discretion,

03:27.337 --> 03:31.080
but I really must urge you to
take this to the authorities.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.777
I'm sure Thomas
would agree.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.693
Well, legally,
there's no obligation

03:35.737 --> 03:37.304
to report the crime.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.044
Legality isn't the only factor

03:39.088 --> 03:40.785
in this scenario.
A man's life

03:40.829 --> 03:43.266
has been taken.
There is a moral obligation.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.789
Believe me, I know.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.052
And I know what you must think,

03:47.096 --> 03:51.448
but however this looks,
I love my husband.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.842
Our marriage isn't perfect,

03:53.885 --> 03:56.714
but the thought of
losing everything...

03:59.282 --> 04:01.937
I won't blow our lives up
over one mistake,

04:01.980 --> 04:04.331
especially one that was
over before it started.

04:04.374 --> 04:08.204
So this relationship with Jax
was a-a new thing?

04:09.292 --> 04:12.513
I met him a month ago
at a coffee shop.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.515
Valentine's Day, no less.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.821
He took my drink by accident,

04:16.865 --> 04:19.433
and we struck up
a conversation.

04:19.476 --> 04:22.305
He was charming
and funny and...

04:22.349 --> 04:25.700
I knew it was wrong,

04:25.743 --> 04:29.486
but it didn't feel that way;
it felt like fate.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.271
Yeah.

04:32.184 --> 04:33.882
Two nights ago,
I finally agreed

04:33.925 --> 04:36.711
to meet Jax at his place.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.713
But when I got there...

04:41.803 --> 04:45.328
<i>He was a perfect gentleman,
but I... I was so nervous.</i>

04:45.372 --> 04:47.983
<i>I-I'd never done anything
like this before.</i>

04:48.026 --> 04:52.422
<i>He kissed me, and I spilled
my wine on the rug.</i>

04:52.466 --> 04:54.032
I'm so sorry.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.339
<i>So I went to the bathroom
to collect myself.</i>

04:56.383 --> 04:59.255
<i>But the truth is I wasn't sure
if I could go through with it.</i>

04:59.299 --> 05:01.213
<i>That's when I heard
a commotion downstairs.</i>

05:01.257 --> 05:03.433
You know what we're here for.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.305
Just take it easy.

05:05.348 --> 05:06.828
You messed
with the wrong people.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.395
<i>There were two men in masks.</i>

05:08.438 --> 05:10.571
<i>One of them had a gun
to Jax's head,</i>

05:10.614 --> 05:12.660
<i>and when he didn't have
what they were looking for ...don't have it.</i>

05:12.703 --> 05:15.010
<i>...they got violent.</i>

05:15.576 --> 05:17.752
Get a knife from the kitchen.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.755
<i>Jax tried to fight back,</i>

05:20.798 --> 05:22.365
<i>but...</i>

05:23.801 --> 05:25.368
What the hell'd you do?!

05:25.412 --> 05:26.935
He made a move, man.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.980
Find his phone,
I'll search the house.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.289
<i>I was so terrified,</i>

05:33.333 --> 05:35.683
<i>I did the only thing
that I could.</i>

05:35.726 --> 05:37.989
<i>I thought I was dead, too.</i>

05:41.950 --> 05:44.256
They left a few minutes after.

05:44.300 --> 05:47.259
And when I was sure
they were gone, I ran.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.784
And Jax?

05:51.829 --> 05:54.397
He was on the floor,
right where they shot him.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.399
He was dead.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.967
I should have called 911,

05:59.010 --> 06:01.970
but I wasn't supposed
to be there.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.711
And when I spilled my wine,

06:03.754 --> 06:04.842
he mentioned a cleaning service

06:04.886 --> 06:06.148
was coming by in the morning,

06:06.191 --> 06:09.194
so I just assumed
they'd find his body.

06:09.238 --> 06:12.676
I haven't seen any mention
of the matter on the news.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.504
That's just it.
I keep checking.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.027
No one has the story.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.290
So you're afraid you're
the only one that knows

06:18.334 --> 06:20.684
that Jax is dead.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.904
As much as I wish I could,

06:22.947 --> 06:24.645
I can't pretend
his murder didn't happen.

06:24.688 --> 06:27.996
Someone has to
look into this.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.954
Please.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.478
Yeah, we'll see what we can do.

06:32.261 --> 06:33.958
And-and you'll keep
my name out of it?

06:34.002 --> 06:35.917
You have our word.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.884
All right, here we go.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.886
Kimo! What's up, brother?

06:49.626 --> 06:52.020
Oh... you're not Kimo.

06:52.063 --> 06:55.240
No. What was your first clue?

06:55.284 --> 06:58.809
I'm so sorry. Hi.
My name is Orville Wright.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.463
I'm here to see Ice.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.857
Okay. Sign in and wait.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.468
Visiting hours don't start
for another 20 minutes.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.469
Well, officially, yeah.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.645
But unofficially, I, uh...

07:08.689 --> 07:10.081
I bring the guys
some sandwiches,

07:10.125 --> 07:11.866
and they usually let me in
a little earlier.

07:11.909 --> 07:14.999
I already ate.
Are you sure?

07:15.043 --> 07:16.653
There's a pickle in here
with your name on it.

07:16.697 --> 07:19.351
Well, technically it has
Kimo's name on it, but...

07:19.395 --> 07:21.919
Sir... have a seat.

07:23.704 --> 07:24.661
Okay.

07:29.361 --> 07:30.972
Oh, so you're calling me collect
while I'm covering

07:31.015 --> 07:32.495
for your ass for free.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.715
Just add it to the many debts
that I owe you, pal.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.717
I'm just gonna need you to hold
down the fort a little longer.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.895
Look, man, I'm just
giving you a hard time. No rush.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.418
We got things
under control here.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.898
Hey, can you help me out
with another round of Coops

07:43.941 --> 07:46.422
-for table five?
-Gotcha.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.032
Wow, sounds like business
is booming.

07:48.076 --> 07:49.773
Oh, you can thank Suzy for that.

07:49.817 --> 07:52.384
Her new drink menu is on fire.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.256
People can't get enough.

07:54.299 --> 07:58.042
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Wh-What new drink menu?

07:58.086 --> 07:59.783
She didn't clear this with you?

07:59.827 --> 08:02.525
I figured it was
better to ask

08:02.569 --> 08:04.658
for forgiveness than permission.

08:04.701 --> 08:07.443
Well, you asked for permission,
and I-I said no.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.966
Oh, come on, live a little.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.620
The menu's older than I am.

08:10.664 --> 08:11.708
It's classic.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.101
It's ancient.

08:13.144 --> 08:14.668
All I'm asking is to
liven the place up a bit.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.931
Same vibe,
new signature cocktails.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.324
Mr. Wright.

08:19.368 --> 08:20.935
Look, I gotta go.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.414
Uh, listen, have your fun,
but, uh,

08:22.458 --> 08:24.155
don't expect these changes
to stick.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.940
Course not. Wouldn't want you
making too much money.

08:25.983 --> 08:28.812
Very funny.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.514
You want to try one of
those sandwiches, don't you?

08:34.557 --> 08:37.473
My supervisor says your friend
can't have any visitors today.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.301
You'll have to come back
another time.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.781
Wait. Why?

08:40.824 --> 08:44.306
It's against policy to discuss
an inmate with non-family.

08:44.349 --> 08:45.220
Now hang on,

08:45.263 --> 08:46.743
I-I am his family, all right?

08:46.787 --> 08:48.702
I want to talk to Kimo.
-Where's Kimo?
-Sorry.

08:48.745 --> 08:50.486
Kimo's not here either.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.270
What do you mean
they're not here?

08:56.187 --> 08:58.581
Kimo! What the hell happened?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.235
He collapsed in his cell.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.106
I didn't know how to reach you.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.501
Docs just left. He's resting.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.373
He's gonna be okay, right?

09:08.417 --> 09:11.942
I'm sure we'll know more soon.

09:23.650 --> 09:24.999
Awfully quiet over there.

09:25.042 --> 09:28.916
Is it because I haven't
called the cops?

09:28.959 --> 09:30.613
We should have handed
this case over to Katsumoto

09:30.657 --> 09:32.615
-as soon as we got it.
-There it is.

09:32.659 --> 09:37.272
I mean, a man has been murdered,
and our client is putting

09:37.315 --> 09:38.621
her personal life first.
It's...

09:38.665 --> 09:39.883
It's-it's selfish.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.406
It's human.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.844
Elena might not be
an angel, but...

09:43.887 --> 09:45.672
she's trying to do
-the right thing.
-The right thing

09:45.715 --> 09:48.022
would have been not planning
to cheat on her husband

09:48.065 --> 09:49.806
-in the first place.
-Look,

09:49.850 --> 09:53.549
I don't condone cheating, but
relationships are complicated.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.682
I mean, don't you
think you're being

09:55.725 --> 09:58.032
the slightest bit judgy?

10:00.208 --> 10:03.167
I'm just calling it
how I see it, that's all.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.919
This is Jax's house?

10:30.804 --> 10:32.675
You sure this is the place?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.895
Absolutely.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.114
No blood, no body.

10:43.077 --> 10:46.907
Smells like bleach.
Total clean-up job.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.083
The wine-stained rug
isn't here either.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.606
Maybe they used it
to move Jax.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.913
This is what I don't get.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.002
Why go away and then come back?

10:55.045 --> 10:57.091
Either get rid of
the body immediately,

10:57.134 --> 10:59.093
or just leave it.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.052
Maybe they panicked.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.706
She said they didn't
intend to kill him.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.491
At least not until they got
what they were looking for.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.804
I see what Elena
saw in this guy.

11:14.848 --> 11:17.415
He seems pretty impressive.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.636
What's going on here?

11:24.335 --> 11:26.381
I'm so sorry, uh--
we didn't mean to startle you.

11:26.424 --> 11:30.646
We were just looking for the
owner of the house, Jax Connors.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.996
I'm Jax Connors.
Who the hell are you?

11:41.004 --> 11:42.571
<i>Look, I'm two seconds
from calling the cops.</i>

11:42.614 --> 11:43.659
Who are you

11:43.703 --> 11:45.139
and what are you doing
in my house?

11:46.967 --> 11:49.665
I apologize. Uh...

11:49.709 --> 11:53.103
Uh-- Rick Wright,
Calvin & Wright Realty.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.584
Pleasure to meet you. A-And I'm
really sorry for the intrusion,

11:55.627 --> 11:57.978
but we walked up,
the door was wide open

11:58.021 --> 12:00.676
and we couldn't help ourselves.
I mean, this place is stunning.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.114
What is it? A four-bed,
four-bath I'm assuming?

12:07.465 --> 12:09.467
A little rocky
on the dismount

12:09.511 --> 12:12.166
and the aliases were
somewhat unimaginative,

12:12.209 --> 12:13.254
but all in all,
that was well-played.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.430
Eh, well-played
until he sees pictures

12:15.473 --> 12:16.866
of some random guy
in his house.

12:16.910 --> 12:20.000
But it did raise more
questions than it answered.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.002
Who is the dead guy
and why was he in this house?

12:22.045 --> 12:24.221
Well, I stole a look at
Mr. Connors' luggage tag

12:24.265 --> 12:25.440
as we left.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.571
He lives on the mainland.
If this house

12:26.615 --> 12:28.008
is a second residence,

12:28.051 --> 12:30.880
maybe it's listed on a
short-term rental site.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.622
The house is listed on Airbnb,

12:33.665 --> 12:35.929
but it says
it was unoccupied last week.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.409
What about rental companies?

12:38.453 --> 12:40.890
Maybe a third party
oversees the tenants.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.110
Not bad.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.938
Makana Services.

12:45.721 --> 12:46.896
And look who works for them.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.855
Real name
is Eddie Benson.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.032
So he pretended
the house was his,

12:52.075 --> 12:53.642
most likely to impress Elena.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.775
Well, Eddie's killers must
have assumed the same thing.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.039
Maybe that's why
Eddie didn't have

12:59.082 --> 13:01.737
-whatever it was they were after.
-Yeah.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.043
Maybe he just didn't
have it there.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.002
Text Tatty at HPD,
see if you can get

13:06.046 --> 13:08.831
Eddie's real address
and tell him it's important.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.813
Looks like someone beat us here.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.078
I bet it was Eddie's assailants.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.862
Think they got what
they were looking for.

13:39.906 --> 13:43.300
Monitor and keyboard
are here but no tower.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.520
Whatever was on it must
have been important for them

13:45.563 --> 13:47.217
to go to this much trouble.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.353
Wait a minute.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.879
Higgy.
Hmm?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.881
You got to see this.

14:00.709 --> 14:01.797
He was stalking you.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.017
I don't believe this.

14:04.974 --> 14:07.368
So, our run-in
at the coffee shop...

14:07.411 --> 14:09.109
It was intentional.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.893
Looks like he'd been
following you for weeks.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.503
He knew your routines,

14:12.547 --> 14:14.766
your hobbies, he even knew
what book you were reading.

14:14.810 --> 14:17.334
I feel like such a fool.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.858
Maybe I deserve this.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.775
No one deserves this, Elena.

14:29.172 --> 14:32.132
Thank you both
for your services,

14:32.175 --> 14:34.003
but I'm not sure
I need them anymore.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.788
I just want to go home
and put all of this behind me.

14:36.832 --> 14:40.183
Well, might not be
quite that simple.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.011
What do you mean?

14:42.055 --> 14:43.230
Well, you were one of

14:43.273 --> 14:45.014
the last people to
see Eddie alive.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.234
And, well, he clearly made

14:47.277 --> 14:49.323
extensive records
of your relationship.

14:49.366 --> 14:50.933
Your best
bet is still

14:50.977 --> 14:52.935
for us to solve this case
before HPD

14:52.979 --> 14:54.589
comes knocking
on your door.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.373
Then tell me you have a lead.

14:56.417 --> 14:59.072
I wish we could, but a
background check on Eddie

14:59.115 --> 15:00.725
didn't bring up many flags.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.292
Didn't have a criminal record,

15:02.336 --> 15:04.164
no known enemies,
there weren't even

15:04.207 --> 15:06.775
any heated text exchanges,
deleted or otherwise.

15:06.818 --> 15:08.603
Y-You can read our texts?

15:08.646 --> 15:10.997
Well, actually,
we couldn't find any texts

15:11.040 --> 15:13.477
between the two of you
in his phone records,

15:13.521 --> 15:15.958
so, I mean, we just assumed
that you'd used an app

15:16.002 --> 15:17.220
for discrete
communication.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.919
No, I texted the number
he gave me.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.965
Eddie must have had
a burner phone.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.489
We're gonna need
that number, Elena.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.800
Doc.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.323
Are you here for Mr. Hofstetler?

15:33.367 --> 15:35.195
Yeah, how's he doing?

15:35.238 --> 15:37.023
He's had what's known
as a grand mal seizure.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.068
We're running tests
to figure out why,

15:39.112 --> 15:41.984
-but he's stable.
-Can I see him?

15:48.643 --> 15:51.385
Oh, hey, kid.
You look like hell.

15:51.428 --> 15:54.301
Must be the low blood sugar.
My lunch date stood me up.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.912
Oh, trust me, if I had known
what they were serving here,

15:56.956 --> 15:58.609
I'd have stayed in prison.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.222
So, how are you?

16:02.265 --> 16:04.876
Are you, are you in
pain? What can I do?

16:04.920 --> 16:07.357
I must really look like crap.

16:07.401 --> 16:10.317
Haven't seen you this scared
since the day we met.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.014
Now, who you calling scared?

16:12.058 --> 16:14.495
I think it was pretty ballsy
for a 14-year-old kid

16:14.538 --> 16:16.105
to steal a car for a joyride.

16:16.149 --> 16:19.021
Ah. It's not a joyride
if you total it

16:19.065 --> 16:20.631
before you're out
of the driveway.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.329
Ten seconds of glory
and I had to spend

16:22.372 --> 16:24.026
a whole summer
riding a lawn mower

16:24.070 --> 16:25.506
just to pay off the damage.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.811
Yeah.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.596
Well, my yard
never looked so good.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.425
The best part about it?

16:31.468 --> 16:34.776
That clunker wasn't worth half
of what I charged you for it.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.908
Oh, you sly dog.
You're gonna tell me that now?

16:36.952 --> 16:38.127
Why would you do that?

16:38.171 --> 16:40.042
Well, maybe if I'm gonna
meet my maker,

16:40.086 --> 16:41.957
I want to do it
with a clear conscience.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.655
Come on, Ice, don't...

16:46.309 --> 16:48.137
Tell me you're still
fighting this thing.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.618
I sure as hell can't do it

16:50.661 --> 16:52.054
on an empty stomach,
I'll tell you.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.360
Why don't you go out there

16:53.403 --> 16:54.665
and find something
half decent for me, huh?

16:54.709 --> 16:56.363
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

16:56.406 --> 16:57.929
You got it, boss.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.630
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>

17:02.673 --> 17:03.805
You seem to
be taking

17:03.848 --> 17:05.633
our client's infidelity...

17:05.676 --> 17:06.808
kind of personally.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.766
How's that?

17:08.810 --> 17:12.509
Well, Elena was having
a difficult time

17:12.553 --> 17:14.511
and you didn't comfort her,
and the Higgins I know

17:14.555 --> 17:16.470
has more empathy than that.

17:16.513 --> 17:19.995
Okay, so she makes a commitment
to a man who she then betrayed.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.866
I mean, excuse me if I don't
jump at the opportunity

17:21.910 --> 17:23.912
to make her feel better.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.654
So Ethan isn't cheating on you?

17:26.697 --> 17:28.482
What? No.

17:28.525 --> 17:31.180
-And you're not cheating on him?
-No.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.965
Honestly, Magnum. Enough with
this ludicrous third degree.

17:34.009 --> 17:36.707
I'm just saying, I'm-I'm
here if you want to talk.

17:36.751 --> 17:39.449
Gee, thanks. I would like
to talk, about work,

17:39.493 --> 17:41.103
if that's all right.

17:41.147 --> 17:44.019
According to the text records
on Eddie's burner phone,

17:44.063 --> 17:46.108
Elena wasn't the only woman
that he was pursuing.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.110
In the last six months,
he's had a string of affairs

17:48.154 --> 17:50.330
with six different women,
all of whom were married.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.940
Guy certainly has a type.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.160
Yeah, or a death wish.
Manipulated wives

17:54.203 --> 17:57.598
and angry husbands make
for a long list of enemies.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.208
Yes, but our vic was killed

17:59.252 --> 18:01.080
by two men who were
looking for something.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.516
All right? Not quite ready

18:02.559 --> 18:04.344
to connect his death
to the affairs yet.

18:04.387 --> 18:07.477
No, I agree. We're missing
something, definitely.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.133
Why would Eddie stalk
these women for months,

18:11.177 --> 18:13.788
only to date them
for a couple weeks

18:13.831 --> 18:15.877
-and then move on?
-It is odd.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.009
There doesn't appear
to be a jilted partner.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.011
The lovebirds make plans
to see one another again,

18:20.055 --> 18:22.144
and then communication
just stops completely.

18:23.232 --> 18:25.365
Well, everybody
except this woman.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.062
Mia Collins.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.585
Look at her
last text to him.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.239
"I'm not paying you a cent."

18:31.936 --> 18:34.069
What if he was
blackmailing them?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.157
Well, that would
certainly explain

18:35.201 --> 18:36.898
the interest in married women,

18:36.941 --> 18:38.726
and the sudden halt
in communications.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.162
Can you pull up his financials?

18:40.206 --> 18:41.250
Yeah.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.429
Oh, here. Look.

18:46.473 --> 18:50.520
Several large cash deposits
in his recent bank statements.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.218
And the dates...

18:52.261 --> 18:54.307
Yeah, they all correspond with
the end of each of the affairs.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.352
I think we need
to pay Mia a visit.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.224
I mean, she was the only one
who refused to play ball.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.356
Maybe she hired
muscle to recover

19:00.400 --> 19:02.750
whatever leverage
Eddie had on her

19:02.793 --> 19:04.317
and ended up with
a more permanent solution

19:04.360 --> 19:05.883
to the problem.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.715
Sir.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.064
What do you got for me?

19:13.108 --> 19:14.936
Body of a 35 to
40-year-old male

19:14.979 --> 19:17.678
washed up this morning
with a GSW to the chest.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.158
Time of death?

19:19.201 --> 19:20.333
Unclear.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.161
The guy's been submerged
for a while.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.554
M.E. says it's gonna
make forensics difficult.

19:30.386 --> 19:31.170
We got a name?

19:31.213 --> 19:32.432
Here you go.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.527
Get me what you can
on Eddie Benson.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.502
Kids are outside, only Mia's car

19:59.546 --> 20:00.416
in the driveway.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.635
You know, we might actually have

20:01.678 --> 20:03.332
a chance to question her
about the affair.

20:03.376 --> 20:06.466
Still, we can't exactly expect
her to self-incriminate.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.555
Murder suspects tend to want

20:08.598 --> 20:10.209
to be quiet
about their victims.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.558
Yeah, but she's a victim, too.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.429
If she thinks
we're on her side,

20:13.473 --> 20:15.301
maybe she'll trust us
enough to open up.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.220
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

20:21.263 --> 20:23.831
Almost assuredly not.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.224
Well, just follow my lead.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.355
<i>We at Calvin & Wright</i>

20:26.399 --> 20:28.052
are working
on an extortion case.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.054
A client of ours
is suing for damages

20:30.098 --> 20:32.579
after being blackmailed
by Eddie Benson,

20:32.622 --> 20:34.929
aka Jax Connors.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.713
Uh, without wanting

20:36.757 --> 20:39.629
to be indelicate, we
have reason to believe

20:39.673 --> 20:43.111
that you were also
a victim of his?

20:44.286 --> 20:46.897
Yes, we slept together.

20:46.941 --> 20:49.596
But the creep had his
bedroom wired with cameras.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.728
The next thing I know,
he's showing me

20:51.772 --> 20:53.426
a sex tape and threatening
to send it to my husband

20:53.469 --> 20:56.124
if I don't pay him $12,000.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.474
That must have been difficult.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.302
If you had paid,

21:00.346 --> 21:03.479
you would have legal recourse.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.612
You kidding?
I told him to go to hell.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.962
That doesn't
sound good.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.398
What'd I do this time?

21:09.442 --> 21:11.008
Hey, babe. Not you.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.575
Eddie Benson.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.621
According to these two, that's
the real name of the scumbag

21:14.664 --> 21:15.883
I dated.

21:17.319 --> 21:20.279
Uh, so you were aware of Eddie?

21:20.322 --> 21:25.371
no secrets, uh, no shackles.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.288
So you have
an open relationship?

21:29.331 --> 21:31.507
It's not for everyone,
but, uh, it works for us.

21:31.551 --> 21:33.204
If anything, it's made

21:33.248 --> 21:35.163
our partnership more intimate.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.773
Right.

21:36.817 --> 21:40.124
Well, I think we've taken up
enough of your time.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.387
Why don't we show
ourselves out?

21:41.430 --> 21:43.606
It was lovely meeting you.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.438
That was unexpected.

21:49.482 --> 21:53.224
Now who's being judgy?

21:53.268 --> 21:56.750
So, Mia didn't pay Eddie
because she didn't have to.

21:56.793 --> 21:59.013
-Mm.
-He didn't have any leverage.

21:59.056 --> 22:01.494
Maybe we dismissed the
other women too quickly.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.409
I mean, even if they met
Eddie's financial demands,

22:03.452 --> 22:05.193
they couldn't know that he
wouldn't come back later

22:05.236 --> 22:06.629
for more money.

22:06.673 --> 22:08.196
I think we need
to cast a wider net.

22:08.239 --> 22:11.939
Dig into people's phone calls,
e-mails, texts, financials.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.507
If somebody enlisted help
to deal with Eddie,

22:14.550 --> 22:17.031
chances are they left a trail.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.561
What's going on here?
What happened?

22:25.605 --> 22:27.563
-Is he, is he okay?
-He's having a seizure.

22:27.607 --> 22:28.999
I need you to step outside.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.437
Let's get him on his side
and check his airway.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.395
Push Ativan,
one milligram IV.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.136
And someone get him
on the clock.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.619
<i>I don't get it.</i>

22:39.662 --> 22:41.360
Ten minutes ago, he was fine.
What happened?

22:41.403 --> 22:43.187
Tests confirm that
the lung cancer

22:43.231 --> 22:44.580
has metastasized to his brain.

22:44.624 --> 22:47.191
After this last incident,
we've had to put him

22:47.235 --> 22:48.802
on an anti-epileptic drip.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.413
It's essentially a
medically induced coma.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.633
-But he's in no pain.
-Okay.

22:53.676 --> 22:56.462
All right, so what now?
What do we do?

22:56.505 --> 22:59.378
Unfortunately,
there's not much we can do.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.380
Palliative care, yes ..., no, no.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.642
You can't give up on him.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.252
Legally, I don't
have a choice.

23:04.295 --> 23:05.471
Why, because he's
a prisoner?

23:05.514 --> 23:07.298
He's a human being
for God's sake.

23:07.342 --> 23:09.605
Mr. Wright, your friend signed
a do-not-resuscitate order.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.086
He doesn't want treatment.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.262
It's out of my hands.

23:24.359 --> 23:26.100
Oh.

23:26.143 --> 23:27.710
What is it?

23:27.754 --> 23:28.755
It's TC.

23:28.798 --> 23:31.018
Icepick's in the hospital.

23:31.061 --> 23:32.715
He might not make it.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.457
Try Rick.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.985
There's no answer.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.465
Well, at least

23:43.509 --> 23:45.119
Rick's there in the hospital
with him.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.947
Yeah, I mean...

23:46.990 --> 23:49.079
as hard as it is
to say goodbye,

23:49.123 --> 23:52.126
it's... worse
when you don't get the chance.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.476
You're right about that.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.306
And, uh...

23:58.349 --> 24:00.482
whilst I will deny
ever saying it,

24:00.526 --> 24:02.179
you're right
about something else.

24:02.223 --> 24:04.399
I'm taking this Elena case...

24:04.443 --> 24:06.270
personally.

24:06.314 --> 24:07.881
And...

24:07.924 --> 24:09.970
I'm not sure why.
I will figure it out.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.754
Just need some time.

24:11.798 --> 24:13.452
Will you let me
get there?

24:13.495 --> 24:15.236
Of course.

24:15.279 --> 24:17.586
Can I ask you
to do something?

24:17.630 --> 24:19.632
Ease up on Elena?

24:20.807 --> 24:22.504
I still think we need
to persuade her

24:22.548 --> 24:23.766
to talk to the police.

24:25.420 --> 24:26.290
Somehow I think

24:26.334 --> 24:28.554
they already know.

24:35.212 --> 24:36.779
You two better start talking.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.835
<i>Why were you at Eddie Benson's
house earlier today?</i>

24:48.878 --> 24:50.401
Who said we were?

24:50.445 --> 24:52.534
A neighbor saw
two Oahu Water & Power workers

24:52.578 --> 24:54.405
leave the property.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.103
Blonde woman and a Latino man.

24:56.146 --> 24:57.626
That's your move.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.628
We have more than one move,
Gordy.

24:59.672 --> 25:00.890
Calvin & Wright might disagree.

25:00.934 --> 25:02.762
Can someone answer
the question, please?

25:02.805 --> 25:04.938
Because Eddie Benson is dead.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.550
And you two don't seem
surprised.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.770
Well, Eddie Benson was a bad guy
with a lot of enemies.

25:10.813 --> 25:13.120
He was probably gonna
end up dead anyway.

25:14.077 --> 25:16.297
All right, what do you know
about him that I don't?

25:19.039 --> 25:22.346
Okay, he had a nasty
habit of seducing women

25:22.390 --> 25:23.739
and then blackmailing them.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.480
One of his victims hired us
to look into him,

25:25.524 --> 25:27.569
and we confirmed
a pattern

25:27.613 --> 25:29.179
of predatory behavior.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.398
That's interesting.

25:30.441 --> 25:31.617
Blackmail could
certainly explain

25:31.660 --> 25:33.270
why Eddie washed up
on the beach.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.750
You have any idea
who killed him?

25:34.794 --> 25:36.578
Not yet, but we'll get there.

25:36.622 --> 25:39.668
Body dump was amateur hour--
improperly weighted down,

25:39.712 --> 25:41.452
used a brand-new rope.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.585
I'm guessing it was purchased
right around the time of death.

25:43.629 --> 25:44.934
Unfortunately, T.O.D.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.588
is an eight-hour window
and with 50 stores

25:46.632 --> 25:48.677
on Oahu... you're
looking at my week.

25:48.721 --> 25:49.722
Thanks.

25:51.071 --> 25:52.986
Gordon?

25:54.074 --> 25:55.945
What if we could shed
some light on

25:55.989 --> 25:57.556
the time of death?

25:58.644 --> 26:00.167
And how exactly

26:00.210 --> 26:01.298
would you do that?

26:01.342 --> 26:03.518
Did we mention
that our client was

26:03.562 --> 26:06.303
with Eddie
when he died?

26:06.347 --> 26:07.827
Unbelievable.
Forget time of death.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.393
I want to talk to your client.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.178
No, you can't.

26:11.221 --> 26:13.180
Excuse me?

26:13.223 --> 26:14.485
She's a married woman.

26:14.529 --> 26:15.835
She doesn't want to...

26:15.878 --> 26:18.359
have to explain
a police inquiry

26:18.402 --> 26:19.490
to her husband.

26:19.534 --> 26:21.014
First, this is a homicide.

26:21.057 --> 26:23.146
And second,
the man has a right to know.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.627
No, that's up for her
to decide, not us.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.368
Please. She made her bed.

26:27.411 --> 26:29.413
She made a mistake, Gordon.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.111
Eddie's time
of death was just

26:31.154 --> 26:32.939
before midnight on Thursday.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.376
It's all we can say.

26:41.991 --> 26:44.385
What? I gave him all
the information he needs.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.213
Didn't have
to ruin Elena's life.

26:46.256 --> 26:47.344
I didn't see the point.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.564
Fair enough.

27:01.445 --> 27:03.099
Hey, man.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.579
What are you doing here?

27:04.623 --> 27:05.841
Where else would I be?

27:05.885 --> 27:08.627
You shouldn't be going
through this alone.

27:10.454 --> 27:12.543
So how's he doing?

27:12.587 --> 27:14.545
Well, not good.

27:14.589 --> 27:17.723
Between the, uh, cancer
and the seizures...

27:17.766 --> 27:20.682
you know... they don't
expect him to wake up.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.598
But I'm still hoping
for a miracle.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.472
Yeah.

27:29.604 --> 27:32.563
Look, I know this is not
what you want to hear.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.045
But maybe this is the miracle.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.483
You know...
Icepick not in pain.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.485
You by his side.

27:41.529 --> 27:43.009
Till the end.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.707
No, man. Nah, no, no,
his vitals are up and down.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.578
He's in there.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.798
He's fighting.

27:52.279 --> 27:54.194
Yeah, I bet.

27:54.237 --> 27:55.717
But, you know,
sometimes

27:55.761 --> 27:58.328
they do that for us.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.504
Not for them.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.202
You know,
when my grandmama

28:02.245 --> 28:03.725
got sick,

28:03.769 --> 28:05.727
I felt the same way.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.904
It took me years
before I realized...

28:11.472 --> 28:13.866
...she was waiting on me.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.260
I just wish
I had told her sooner

28:17.304 --> 28:18.958
it was okay to go.

28:29.620 --> 28:32.972
Just spoke to an old client
who works at the Bank of Hawaii.

28:33.015 --> 28:35.104
Uh, one of Eddie's victims,
this woman, Karen Parks,

28:35.148 --> 28:37.280
she's got an account there.
Guess who just withdrew

28:37.324 --> 28:39.282
$10,000 in cash?

28:40.327 --> 28:42.285
Okay, wasn't expecting
that to stump you.

28:42.329 --> 28:44.505
I'm thinking that
maybe Karen is paying

28:44.548 --> 28:46.463
the killers for
a job well done.

28:46.507 --> 28:48.639
Then why did several
of Eddie's other victims

28:48.683 --> 28:50.772
just do exactly
the same thing?

28:50.816 --> 28:52.165
I hacked
First Oahu network.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.558
And they all withdrew
the same large amount

28:54.602 --> 28:56.169
in the last hour.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.562
So what do you think, these
women are working together?

29:00.303 --> 29:02.784
There's no evidence that these
women know each other at all.

29:02.828 --> 29:05.482
But maybe the blackmail
is ongoing.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.136
What if Eddie's killers saw

29:07.180 --> 29:10.096
the incriminating files
and they thought they'd

29:10.139 --> 29:11.401
hit the jackpot?

29:11.445 --> 29:13.099
Okay, so the job goes
from burglary to murder.

29:13.142 --> 29:14.796
And these guys decide
to up their payday,

29:14.840 --> 29:16.363
and make it
worth their while.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.757
It's not a bad theory, but they
would have to communicate

29:18.800 --> 29:20.106
that threat somehow.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.501
Look.

29:24.545 --> 29:25.589
Here. All of the women

29:25.633 --> 29:27.156
received calls
from the same number

29:27.200 --> 29:29.028
about 90 minutes ago.

29:29.071 --> 29:31.117
Okay, ping that number
for the location.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.422
I'm gonna grab the car.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.215
Guess the time of death
we supplied was helpful.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.260
You traced the purchase of that
rope to the owner of this house?

29:44.304 --> 29:45.653
I did.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.568
I also identified your client,
Elena Dunn.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.439
-How?
-Eddie had her name
in his calendar.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.615
And that's not all.

29:51.659 --> 29:54.053
They knew she was there
the night of the murder.

30:05.629 --> 30:08.458
Hello?
-Elena, it's us. Uh, listen.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.721
-We don't have much time.
-What's wrong?

30:10.765 --> 30:11.897
The men who killed Eddie

30:11.940 --> 30:13.463
know that you were
there as a witness.

30:13.507 --> 30:15.291
And we believe they're
on their way to get you.

30:15.335 --> 30:16.858
Th-They're coming here?

30:18.947 --> 30:20.296
Everyone's gone.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.732
What do I do?

30:21.776 --> 30:23.169
You need to get out
of the building

30:23.212 --> 30:24.257
and get to a public place.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.606
They won't touch you in a crowd.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.695
Keep this line open, Elena.
We're on our way.

30:32.134 --> 30:33.353
Okay, I've got visuals inside.

30:33.396 --> 30:34.658
If I can access
the lobby cameras,

30:34.702 --> 30:37.052
I'll know when they arrive.

30:37.096 --> 30:39.489
Oh, my God.
They're already there.

30:39.533 --> 30:42.405
Okay, Elena,
we need you to stay calm

30:42.449 --> 30:44.016
and find cover.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.495
They're inside the building
and they're coming up right now.

31:21.227 --> 31:22.532
She ain't here, man.

31:24.926 --> 31:25.709
Nah, she is.

31:25.753 --> 31:26.972
We just missed her.

31:27.015 --> 31:29.757
She ain't too far though.
Keep searching.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.022
Elena, are you still there?

31:34.066 --> 31:36.329
Yes. Are you close?

31:36.372 --> 31:38.984
Yeah, we're two minutes away.
Can you get to a secure room?

31:39.027 --> 31:42.248
Um, there's a-a locked room
for sensitive case files.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.945
You need a code.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.165
It's across the office,
but I think I can get to it.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.428
Okay, go now.

32:21.461 --> 32:23.115
Don't move!

32:24.377 --> 32:25.421
Down on the ground.

32:25.465 --> 32:26.422
Hey, hey.

32:26.466 --> 32:27.728
Look at me.

32:27.771 --> 32:29.382
Hey, hey.
You're all right.

32:29.425 --> 32:30.383
It's over.

32:30.426 --> 32:31.819
I got you.
You're safe now.

32:31.862 --> 32:32.994
Come on.

32:34.343 --> 32:36.084
Let's go.

32:36.128 --> 32:37.433
Just get her out of here.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.740
Are you okay?
Yeah.

32:47.661 --> 32:49.097
I don't know
how to thank you.

32:49.141 --> 32:50.969
No, we're just glad
you're all right.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.276
My husband.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.017
He's here.
Yeah.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.584
When the police learned
you were a target,

32:57.627 --> 32:58.759
they called your house.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.500
Does he know?

33:00.543 --> 33:01.980
No.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.894
We thought that best
left to you.

33:05.853 --> 33:07.986
What if he can't forgive me?

33:08.029 --> 33:10.336
How do we move on from this?

33:10.379 --> 33:12.642
Maybe you don't
have to move on.

33:12.686 --> 33:14.166
You just have
to move forward.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.472
I mean, if you guys
love each other,

33:16.516 --> 33:18.648
you'll find a way.

33:26.178 --> 33:28.528
She was lucky to have you two
looking out for her tonight.

33:28.571 --> 33:30.095
You weren't so bad yourself.

33:30.138 --> 33:31.487
Well, my work's not done yet.

33:31.531 --> 33:33.881
Perps won't give up the man
that hired them.

33:33.924 --> 33:36.101
Who said it was a man?

33:36.449 --> 33:38.277
He did.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.887
He said,
"I'm not giving you <i>his</i> name."

33:39.930 --> 33:43.282
Whoever hired these geniuses
definitely overpaid.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.632
Yeah, but all of Eddie's
blackmail victims

33:45.675 --> 33:47.808
were prepared
to pay again tonight.

33:47.851 --> 33:49.462
Which means they still
have secrets.

33:49.505 --> 33:51.246
Their husbands don't know.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.814
Everybody except
for Wade Collins.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.859
-Who?
-One of Eddie's victims,

33:55.903 --> 33:58.079
Mia Collins,
she was in an open marriage.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.038
Her husband actually knew
about the relationship.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.517
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
he would let a stranger

34:01.561 --> 34:02.736
keep compromising footage

34:02.779 --> 34:04.303
of the mother
of his children.

34:04.346 --> 34:06.348
It's a good theory.
I'll look into it.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.220
Thanks.

34:19.448 --> 34:20.667
You ready?

34:20.710 --> 34:22.712
Yeah. Think I am.

34:37.031 --> 34:39.686
Sorry I'm late, old man.

34:39.729 --> 34:41.992
Just, uh...

34:42.036 --> 34:45.083
somehow I didn't really-really
believe this was it.

34:51.219 --> 34:52.742
Guess, uh...

34:54.266 --> 34:57.965
...guess it was easier to
pretend like we had more time.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.798
Wasn't the first time, you know.

35:06.626 --> 35:09.150
Trust me, you were,
you were fooling no one

35:09.194 --> 35:12.240
with that crappy car of yours.

35:14.068 --> 35:17.767
The second I totaled it,
I knew I did you a favor.

35:26.776 --> 35:29.127
But working for you that summer?

35:30.737 --> 35:36.743
That was the first time anybody
expected anything of me.

35:40.355 --> 35:43.793
The first time anybody
looked out for me.

35:51.323 --> 35:54.152
I guess I didn't,
I didn't want that to end.

35:57.546 --> 35:59.809
I still don't.

36:10.994 --> 36:13.214
But you saved my life.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.874
The least I can do
is let you go out on your terms.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.841
I love you.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.055
He's gone?

37:16.190 --> 37:18.236
I'm sorry, man.

37:20.455 --> 37:21.630
Yeah.

37:26.722 --> 37:28.681
What's this?

37:28.724 --> 37:31.074
Your friend Kimo
sent it to me.

37:32.075 --> 37:34.556
Ice wanted to make sure
that you got it.

37:36.210 --> 37:38.386
I'll give you
some privacy.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.965
Hey, Ricky. Uh...

37:52.008 --> 37:55.011
I guess,
if you're seeing this, I'm...

37:55.055 --> 37:57.884
I'm finally a free man.

37:57.927 --> 38:01.409
And given
the circumstances, I...

38:01.453 --> 38:05.283
I think it's a possibility
we didn't get a real goodbye.

38:06.588 --> 38:12.246
And I know maybe
that-that hurts, right now.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.466
Maybe even seems unfair.

38:14.509 --> 38:16.076
♪ Well, you never know...

38:16.119 --> 38:19.253
But the truth is, kid,
you and me?

38:19.297 --> 38:21.081
We don't need any of that crap.

38:23.605 --> 38:26.956
I'm always gonna look out
for you, kid.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.307
Wherever I am...

38:29.350 --> 38:31.831
I'm okay.

38:31.874 --> 38:35.138
If you're okay, I'm okay.

38:35.182 --> 38:38.316
♪ In your car, the windows are

39:12.306 --> 39:14.874
Just talked to Katsumoto.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.397
We were right about Wade.

39:16.441 --> 39:19.618
Money transfer confirms
he hired Eddie's killer.

39:19.661 --> 39:20.923
And Mia?

39:20.967 --> 39:22.534
She was in the dark.

39:22.577 --> 39:25.580
I guess their marriage did have
some secrets after all.

39:25.624 --> 39:28.670
Not that secrets between
partners is a bad thing.

39:30.933 --> 39:32.413
All right, Magnum.

39:34.633 --> 39:35.764
I figured out

39:35.808 --> 39:38.027
why this case was
affecting me so much.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.551
Thank you
for letting me get there.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.903
The truth is,

39:43.946 --> 39:47.994
I was being judgmental
about Elena because I was...

39:48.037 --> 39:50.300
I was actually judging myself.

39:50.344 --> 39:51.780
My own relationship.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.304
I thought things with you
and Ethan were going well.

39:54.348 --> 39:57.090
They are. They're great.

39:57.133 --> 39:59.179
That's the problem.

39:59.222 --> 40:01.224
When I promised
to spend the rest of my life

40:01.268 --> 40:03.836
with Richard, I meant it.

40:03.879 --> 40:06.752
I mean, he's been gone
a few years now, but...

40:06.795 --> 40:09.885
I felt that whilst
my heart was still his,

40:09.929 --> 40:13.193
a small part of him
was still here and...

40:13.236 --> 40:14.803
now I'm...

40:14.847 --> 40:17.327
You feel like you're betraying
him because you're falling

40:17.371 --> 40:19.417
in love with Ethan.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.550
I think I already have fallen.

40:24.770 --> 40:27.468
That's something to celebrate,
not feel guilty about.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.209
But I do feel guilty.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.821
Well, something tells me
he would be happy for you.

40:35.128 --> 40:36.564
Thanks, Magnum.

40:36.608 --> 40:39.393
Now, cheating on the
tennis court this morning,

40:39.437 --> 40:41.439
that is something
to feel guilty about.

40:41.482 --> 40:44.093
Come off it.
That ball was clearly out.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.748
No, it wasn't, it was
clearly on the line.

40:46.792 --> 40:48.315
-Hey.
-Shammy. All right.

40:48.358 --> 40:49.708
Perfect timing. I need you

40:49.751 --> 40:51.318
to help us
settle something real quick.

40:51.361 --> 40:52.580
I got the video on my phone.
Give me one...

40:52.624 --> 40:54.452
Whatever it is,
I side with Higgins.

40:55.670 --> 40:58.891
Don't even have to
see the video. Okay.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.588
Very sensible.

41:11.338 --> 41:12.731
Hey.

41:12.774 --> 41:15.560
Your friends are waiting
for you on the lanai.

41:16.561 --> 41:18.171
Um, you know what?

41:18.214 --> 41:20.434
I'll meet you out there.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.957
You got it, bro.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.875
I'm sorry about
your friend.

41:26.919 --> 41:29.225
Thanks.

41:29.269 --> 41:32.490
And, uh, thanks for keeping
an eye on the place.

41:32.533 --> 41:35.362
It's the least I could do.
And look, it's still standing.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.192
So are these the drinks

41:39.235 --> 41:40.933
everybody's talking about?

41:40.976 --> 41:42.978
'Cause I sure could use one.

41:45.938 --> 41:48.375
Nine bucks
for a "Big Island Iced Tea"?

41:48.418 --> 41:50.333
Oh, just shut up and try it.

41:53.641 --> 41:55.295
Say it. It's delicious.

41:55.338 --> 41:57.558
It's delicious.

41:57.602 --> 41:59.952
Wow. And, uh...

41:59.995 --> 42:02.607
nine bucks for that amount
of booze, that's a steal.

42:02.650 --> 42:06.828
Well, maybe we can call it
"The Icepick" instead.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.179
I'll leave you guys to it.

42:10.223 --> 42:11.964
I'll see you tomorrow, boss.

42:12.007 --> 42:13.966
Tomorrow.

42:24.411 --> 42:26.369
Icepick.

42:29.111 --> 42:30.373
Hey.
There he is.

42:30.417 --> 42:32.158
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:32.201 --> 42:33.768
How you holding up?

42:33.812 --> 42:36.641
Uh, you know what? I'm okay.

42:36.684 --> 42:38.730
Or, you know, I-I will be.

42:39.644 --> 42:41.515
We know how much
he meant to you.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.213
And how much you meant to him.

42:44.257 --> 42:45.388
Yeah, if there's anything

42:45.432 --> 42:47.086
we can do.

42:48.391 --> 42:51.743
Yeah, well, uh, you know what?
There is.

42:51.786 --> 42:53.092
You guys can all raise
your glasses

42:53.135 --> 42:54.659
and make sure
I'm not drinking alone.

42:54.702 --> 42:56.269
Don't have to ask me twice.

42:56.312 --> 42:57.226
Hear, hear.

42:59.315 --> 43:00.490
To Icepick.

43:00.534 --> 43:03.842
He will be missed.
May he rest in peace.

43:03.885 --> 43:06.148
-To Ice.
To Ice.
