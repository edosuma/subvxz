00:24.098 --> 00:25.429
In recent months,

00:25.500 --> 00:26.967
there's been
a rash of car thefts.

00:27.034 --> 00:29.002
The "bump-and-run"
is the latest technique.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.367
Let's get out
of here!

00:30.438 --> 00:31.962
You wanted to steal a car,

00:32.073 --> 00:34.541
and now you've stolen
the ride of your lives.

00:39.514 --> 00:41.414
The Pennington
has been stolen, Michael.

00:41.482 --> 00:42.949
Can Carrie's car make it?

00:43.017 --> 00:45.451
If it does, it will be
by the skin of its bumper.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.680
There's my car!

01:05.339 --> 01:07.705
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:07.809 --> 01:09.902
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:09.977 --> 01:12.002
who does not exist.

01:18.319 --> 01:20.412
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:20.488 --> 01:23.048
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:23.124 --> 01:25.217
the helpless, the powerless,

01:25.293 --> 01:28.660
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:00.955 --> 03:02.422
Oh.

03:02.857 --> 03:04.324
Uh-oh.

03:05.860 --> 03:08.090
Is that all you can find
to say, madam?

03:08.329 --> 03:11.821
Oh, you're gonna be mad.
Oh, don't be mad.

03:11.899 --> 03:14.026
It's such
a beautiful day.

03:14.468 --> 03:15.935
Nevertheless,

03:16.103 --> 03:17.832
this car you
so carelessly struck

03:17.939 --> 03:19.907
just happens to be
one of the very few

03:19.974 --> 03:22.499
Pennington Ascot Regencies
left in the world.

03:22.610 --> 03:24.373
And it is not mine.

03:25.112 --> 03:28.013
Oh, Bobby Jo's
just going to kill me.

03:28.182 --> 03:29.945
I need identification.

03:30.017 --> 03:31.848
I also need your insurance.

03:31.919 --> 03:33.614
You are insured,
aren't you?

03:36.123 --> 03:38.785
Bobby Jo is.
This is his car.

03:39.627 --> 03:41.891
My purse,
it's in the front seat.

03:41.963 --> 03:43.897
Would you, oh, please?

03:44.865 --> 03:46.765
I don't feel so good.

04:11.225 --> 04:12.624
Oh, my God.

04:14.495 --> 04:17.089
Devon sure looked great
in that blazer, didn't he?

04:17.164 --> 04:18.721
I had the distinct impression

04:18.798 --> 04:20.596
he was trying to impress
the car.

04:20.668 --> 04:22.135
Can you blame him?

04:22.203 --> 04:24.569
The Pennington Ascot Regency
is a classic.

04:26.374 --> 04:28.274
Not that you aren't
in its class.

04:32.613 --> 04:33.807
Actually, KITT,

04:33.881 --> 04:36.315
you're in a class
all by yourself.

04:37.618 --> 04:38.915
You're one of a kind.

04:38.986 --> 04:40.214
Thank you.

04:40.287 --> 04:41.276
Mmm-hmm.

04:41.722 --> 04:43.053
Hello, Devon.

04:43.124 --> 04:45.490
I thought you were out
joyriding in the Pennington.

04:45.559 --> 04:47.356
The Pennington
has been stolen, Michael.

04:47.428 --> 04:48.417
What?

04:48.496 --> 04:50.020
I'll explain later.

04:50.097 --> 04:52.565
The point is Cdr. Smythe
is due back here,

04:52.633 --> 04:53.930
early Monday morning.

04:54.001 --> 04:56.367
Now, if he returns, and I
haven't got the Pennington-

04:56.437 --> 04:59.065
Say no more.
I'll meet you at the semi.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.411
Devon, are you sure
it was planned?

05:11.485 --> 05:13.749
Yes, it was
a professional job.

05:14.255 --> 05:17.224
I wish I'd been rude and told
her to fetch her own purse.

05:17.291 --> 05:18.952
A gentleman
to the very end.

05:19.026 --> 05:20.618
All right,
what've you got?

05:22.463 --> 05:24.192
Well, in recent months,

05:24.265 --> 05:26.859
there's been a rash of
custom and classic car thefts.

05:26.934 --> 05:29.129
The "bump-and-run"
is the latest technique.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.171
Well, if that's all
we've got to go on,

05:31.238 --> 05:33.035
somebody's
in a lot of trouble.

05:33.140 --> 05:35.074
Must you be so negative?

05:35.142 --> 05:38.111
Actually, it's not all
we've got to go on. April?

05:38.612 --> 05:41.581
Well, I think we've come up
with a common denominator.

05:41.649 --> 05:43.207
Everywhere
there's been a theft,

05:43.284 --> 05:45.775
there's also been a custom
car show not far away.

05:45.853 --> 05:48.549
Makes a lot of sense.
The shows attract cars.

05:48.622 --> 05:50.487
The cars attract
potential buyers.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.185
Which is precisely
the reason

05:52.259 --> 05:53.783
that you're going
to Barton Springs.

05:53.861 --> 05:55.795
If they are planning
to sell the Pennington,

05:55.863 --> 05:57.387
this could very well
be the place.

05:57.832 --> 06:01.290
The Barton Springs
Custom and Classic Car Show.

06:44.845 --> 06:45.834
Nice car.

06:45.946 --> 06:47.072
Oh, thanks.

06:47.148 --> 06:48.308
I hope the judges
think so.

06:48.382 --> 06:49.440
Yeah.

06:49.817 --> 06:51.478
Can you tell me
who runs the show?

06:51.552 --> 06:54.487
Sure. Uh, Suzanne Weston.
She's over there.

06:54.655 --> 06:56.088
Look for the tightest pants.

06:56.390 --> 06:57.789
Thanks.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.161
May I have
your ticket, ma'am?

07:04.231 --> 07:06.324
Great. Good luck.
Thank you.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.896
Hi, you Miss Weston?

07:07.968 --> 07:09.026
Mmm-hmm.

07:09.103 --> 07:11.037
Name's Michael Knight.

07:11.539 --> 07:12.597
I'm a collector.

07:12.706 --> 07:15.266
Couple of my buddies told me
I hadn't been to a show,

07:15.376 --> 07:16.934
till I'd been
to one of yours.

07:17.044 --> 07:20.343
From what I can see, they
weren't just blowing smoke.

07:23.717 --> 07:25.582
It'll be the best show
this season.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.417
That's real good to hear,
because I'm looking for a car.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.047
Something real special.

07:30.124 --> 07:31.921
Of course I know
some of the best deals

07:31.992 --> 07:33.857
aren't always
in the open market.

07:33.928 --> 07:37.364
Sometimes privacy
is as important as pink slips.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.523
I just run a car show,
Michael.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.795
I don't handle private sales.

07:42.303 --> 07:45.136
But, uh, hang around.
Mingle a bit,

07:45.239 --> 07:46.729
get to know the owners.

07:47.241 --> 07:49.971
Who knows what a good-looking
man like you might turn up.

08:05.192 --> 08:06.216
Now you remember,

08:06.293 --> 08:08.488
when you wave,
make a big show of it.

08:08.596 --> 08:10.029
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:10.064 --> 08:12.259
Move back here, folks.
Move back. Move back.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.824
Let the Longhorn in.
Get away from it.

08:14.902 --> 08:17.803
There's plenty of gawking
to be done on the inside.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.670
Dobie, Dobie, come on,
take it in there.

08:21.041 --> 08:23.373
Hit anybody
that touches the paint.

08:23.444 --> 08:24.843
Nora, come on.

08:24.912 --> 08:27.574
Psst. Back off, pard.
Don't crowd the Horn.

08:27.648 --> 08:30.208
Not crowding.
Just looking, pard.

08:38.926 --> 08:41.520
We gotta have
a little talk, Suzanne.

08:41.595 --> 08:43.085
I was promised
supreme spotting

08:43.163 --> 08:44.221
on the inside.

08:44.298 --> 08:45.959
I get here,
and what do I find?

08:46.033 --> 08:48.058
I find the Haver girl
has got that spot.

08:48.135 --> 08:49.261
Now, you gotta
figure out

08:49.336 --> 08:51.531
who the star of
this show is, sweetheart.

08:51.639 --> 08:53.300
In a minute.
In a minute, Buck.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.739
This is Michael Knight.
Nora and Buck Rayburn.

08:55.809 --> 08:57.242
Buck is also a collector.

08:57.311 --> 08:58.300
Really?

08:58.412 --> 09:00.346
Maybe we'll get a chance
to talk later, huh?

09:00.414 --> 09:02.507
Sure thing. Just as soon
as I get squared away

09:02.583 --> 09:03.845
with the sweetheart here.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.113
Now, why can't I put the Horn

09:06.186 --> 09:08.051
right next to
the Haver girl's car?

09:08.155 --> 09:09.554
Buck, there's no room.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.451
Look at
that blonde.

09:16.563 --> 09:17.587
Oh!

09:17.665 --> 09:20.190
That bathing suit's
got to be painted on.

09:20.267 --> 09:21.666
What there is of it.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.431
Now, she would make
a great cheerleader.

09:24.538 --> 09:26.506
Will you forget
about cheerleaders?

09:26.573 --> 09:28.165
Who cares about
credentials here?

09:28.275 --> 09:29.640
I'm talking flesh.

09:29.710 --> 09:32.304
You know what it takes to get
that kind of flesh, Hector?

09:33.414 --> 09:35.882
Big bucks, Hector.
Or a hot car.

09:43.824 --> 09:45.416
Excuse me.

09:55.703 --> 09:57.034
How're you doing, pal?

09:57.104 --> 09:58.969
I'm doing
just as you asked, Michael.

09:59.073 --> 10:01.564
Snapping pictures
of every woman who walks by.

10:01.675 --> 10:03.700
I feel absolutely ludicrous.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.109
Like a second-rate spy
in a B movie.

10:06.180 --> 10:07.807
It's gotta be done.

10:07.915 --> 10:10.110
Devon just might be
able to ID someone.

10:10.150 --> 10:13.051
I suppose.
Are you making any progress?

10:13.220 --> 10:15.017
No. No bites yet.

10:15.089 --> 10:16.886
Well, I'll continue
working the party,

10:16.957 --> 10:18.720
and, uh, show everybody
I'm in the market.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.157
Working the party?

10:20.227 --> 10:21.694
You call making small talk

10:21.762 --> 10:23.730
and drinking margaritas
working?

10:23.797 --> 10:26.857
Keep your scanners peeled
and your shutter snapping.

10:26.934 --> 10:30.461
I know. It's a dirty job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.378
Don't be stupid.

10:40.447 --> 10:43.314
This is a chance to do
something with your life.

10:43.384 --> 10:44.908
Thanks for
your interest.

10:44.985 --> 10:46.475
But in case
you didn't notice,

10:46.553 --> 10:47.679
I already am.

10:47.755 --> 10:50.121
What? Towing around
your father's dream?

10:50.190 --> 10:53.455
Carrie, that car was
his fixation, not yours.

10:54.962 --> 10:57.556
I'll give you $20,000 cash.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.300
The car's not for sale,
Suzanne.

11:01.702 --> 11:04.034
Not now. Not ever.

11:04.104 --> 11:06.698
$20,000.
That's as high as I'll go.

11:08.008 --> 11:10.340
If you're smart,
you'll take it.

11:17.418 --> 11:18.544
Hi.

11:19.219 --> 11:20.447
Oh, hi.

11:21.088 --> 11:22.487
You okay?

11:22.623 --> 11:24.181
Sure, I'm okay.

11:24.258 --> 11:27.421
Yeah, well, I couldn't help
overhearing the conversation.

11:27.494 --> 11:28.984
Yeah.

11:30.798 --> 11:33.631
It's just some of
these people around here.

11:34.034 --> 11:36.502
It's like my dad
never even existed.

11:37.671 --> 11:40.139
"Eddie Haver died?
Oh, too bad.

11:40.841 --> 11:42.570
"Maybe his kid's
desperate.

11:43.143 --> 11:45.441
"Maybe we can- Maybe
we can buy his dream

11:45.512 --> 11:47.343
for 10 cents
on the dollar. "

11:49.083 --> 11:51.278
On Sunday, they'll be crying

11:51.351 --> 11:53.546
when the judges
announce the winner.

11:55.989 --> 11:57.183
Thanks.

11:57.891 --> 11:58.949
Hey.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.588
How about
breakfast tomorrow?

12:01.662 --> 12:04.563
Oh, well, I plan to be
at the show by 7:00.

12:04.631 --> 12:06.462
Me, too. Get some coffee
and doughnuts

12:06.533 --> 12:07.830
and drive over together.

12:08.502 --> 12:10.094
You sure you're not
trying to bribe me

12:10.170 --> 12:11.364
to sell you my car?

12:11.505 --> 12:13.973
Bribe you?
With coffee and doughnuts?

12:15.442 --> 12:16.500
Tomorrow?

12:16.610 --> 12:17.668
Okay.

12:17.778 --> 12:18.972
Okay. See you tomorrow.

12:19.046 --> 12:20.240
Good night.

12:24.251 --> 12:25.878
Michael,

12:26.186 --> 12:27.653
she's just a kid.

12:27.721 --> 12:29.882
Cute, but really not
in your league.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.687
When you're ready to graduate,
stop by and say hello.

12:32.759 --> 12:34.249
Room 358.

12:50.377 --> 12:51.810
You know the people here?

12:51.879 --> 12:54.245
Some.
Mostly by reputation.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.945
They're a mixed bag.

12:56.016 --> 12:58.576
Owners, drivers,
collectors...

12:58.652 --> 13:00.882
Lots of wheeling
and dealing.

13:01.121 --> 13:03.385
What about this, uh,
Suzanne Weston?

13:03.891 --> 13:05.552
Hmm. Suzanne.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.726
She's the type of woman
who wants something

13:07.794 --> 13:09.227
if someone else has it.

13:09.296 --> 13:11.594
Cars, men,
it doesn't matter.

13:14.067 --> 13:15.591
That's my car!

13:22.976 --> 13:24.170
My car!

13:26.213 --> 13:27.578
Michael,
is he dead?

13:27.648 --> 13:30.242
He'll be okay.
Call an ambulance. Go!

13:33.287 --> 13:34.879
KITT, get over here, quick.

14:06.486 --> 14:09.182
Michael, there's a train track
less than a mile ahead.

14:09.289 --> 14:10.916
As long as there's no train.

14:10.958 --> 14:13.153
That's precisely my point.
There is.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.994
All right,
let's have a look.

14:25.339 --> 14:26.829
Can Carrie's car make it?

14:26.940 --> 14:29.374
If it does, it will be
by the skin of its bumper.

14:29.443 --> 14:30.467
What about us?

14:30.577 --> 14:32.545
Certainly not
in the conventional way.

14:46.660 --> 14:47.786
Get ready, pal.

14:47.861 --> 14:49.123
Michael.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.770
You got them on your scanner?

15:02.876 --> 15:04.173
I hate to say it, Michael,

15:04.244 --> 15:05.905
but Carrie's car
has disappeared.

15:14.254 --> 15:15.846
We've got a contract!

15:15.922 --> 15:17.480
No contract on Earth

15:17.557 --> 15:20.287
is gonna keep the Longhorn
here overnight again.

15:20.394 --> 15:22.862
I'm lucky that thief
was blessed with bad taste

15:22.929 --> 15:24.829
and didn't steal
the Horn as it is.

15:24.898 --> 15:26.388
I could sue you, Rayburn.

15:26.466 --> 15:29.128
Not without a counter-suit,
Miss Weston.

15:29.202 --> 15:32.103
Your contract guaranteed
adequate security.

15:32.239 --> 15:33.934
You tell her, sweet pea.

15:34.541 --> 15:36.133
I'll double the security.

15:36.243 --> 15:37.608
Oh, God.

15:41.848 --> 15:43.873
They said
they'll do their best.

15:43.950 --> 15:46.748
Which is a sure sign they
have no hope of recovering it.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.311
Don't make it any worse
than it already is.

15:49.389 --> 15:51.118
It couldn't get
any worse.

15:52.859 --> 15:54.554
Thanks for
trying to help.

15:56.229 --> 15:58.925
By the way,
that's some car you've got.

15:59.966 --> 16:01.399
Who are you?

16:01.501 --> 16:03.935
I mean. you're more
than what you've said.

16:04.638 --> 16:06.367
Well, believe it or not,

16:07.674 --> 16:10.768
I'm here to find out
who's been stealing the cars

16:10.877 --> 16:12.742
whenever there's a show.

16:12.813 --> 16:14.713
What are you,
an undercover cop?

16:15.182 --> 16:16.479
Something like that.

16:16.550 --> 16:19.212
Listen, I don't know about
you, but my car is all I've got.

16:19.286 --> 16:20.514
Let me work with you.

16:20.587 --> 16:23.181
I'm sorry, I work alone.
Besides, it could be dangerous.

16:23.256 --> 16:25.087
Well, I'm not afraid.
Please...

16:25.158 --> 16:27.353
If you had anything
to do with this...

16:27.427 --> 16:30.294
If that's an accusation, you'd
better be able to back it up.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.889
Oh, if I could back it up,
you wouldn't be standing there

16:32.966 --> 16:35.025
with your eye shadow
so perfectly overdone.

16:35.102 --> 16:36.399
Well, you've got a smart mouth

16:36.470 --> 16:38.563
for a girl who's just turned
in her training bra.

16:38.672 --> 16:39.764
Okay, hold it.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.636
Nobody feels very good
about this,

16:41.742 --> 16:43.733
and this is not gonna make
anyone feel better.

16:43.844 --> 16:45.141
So why don't
we call it a draw

16:45.212 --> 16:47.180
and each of us go out
to our neutral corners.

16:47.247 --> 16:48.839
What's your interest
in this?

16:48.915 --> 16:51.281
Just mingling, like you said.

16:51.418 --> 16:54.148
Well, maybe you should learn
to be a little more selective.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.556
Come on,
I'll buy you a lemonade.

17:00.994 --> 17:02.018
A double.

17:02.095 --> 17:03.392
You gonna do this
all your life?

17:03.463 --> 17:04.487
What?

17:04.564 --> 17:06.896
This. Stare at the ground
prowling for cigarette butts.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.263
If you're gonna lecture me
about smoking, Leroy...

17:09.301 --> 17:11.566
I'm not talking about
smoking, beetle-brain,

17:11.671 --> 17:14.162
I'm talking about this.
Common labor.

17:14.273 --> 17:16.333
How many cheerleaders
you think you're gonna get

17:16.443 --> 17:17.967
on $2.25 an hour?

17:18.078 --> 17:19.909
Is that all we make?

17:20.579 --> 17:22.741
Hector, Hector, Hector,
I'm telling you,

17:22.816 --> 17:26.411
if you want cheerleaders
you gotta have a fancy car.

17:28.822 --> 17:30.551
On $2.25 an hour?

17:31.191 --> 17:34.922
Hector, what you make does not
necessarily determine how you live.

17:35.495 --> 17:38.191
Look at the guy who stole
that girl's car this morning.

17:38.698 --> 17:40.393
He didn't work for it.

17:41.701 --> 17:43.362
But he's got it.

17:45.172 --> 17:46.366
Come on.

17:47.808 --> 17:49.241
Well, I've studied

17:49.309 --> 17:51.140
all the photos
KITT's transmitted.

17:51.211 --> 17:52.235
Anything?

17:52.345 --> 17:53.539
Nothing, I'm afraid.

17:53.613 --> 17:55.945
I'm beginning to wonder
if I'd recognize her,

17:56.016 --> 17:58.211
if I bumped into each other
at the supermarket.

17:58.285 --> 18:01.254
Devon, you don't go
to supermarkets.

18:01.321 --> 18:03.653
Yes, quite right, but
you take my point, don't you?

18:03.723 --> 18:05.554
April went over
the stolen car

18:05.625 --> 18:07.616
and found
a single strand of hair,

18:07.727 --> 18:09.820
from an expensive
wig made of Elura.

18:09.863 --> 18:11.888
What about the background
on our people?

18:11.965 --> 18:13.057
Nothing, I'm afraid.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.794
With the exception
of Suzanne Weston.

18:14.868 --> 18:16.358
She has an arrest record.

18:16.436 --> 18:18.131
An arrest record?

18:18.638 --> 18:20.128
Don't tell me.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.672
Quite right, Michael.

18:21.741 --> 18:24.175
Two counts
of grand theft auto.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.070
No convictions.

18:26.179 --> 18:27.806
Interesting lady.

18:28.648 --> 18:31.446
I wonder if she has
an affinity for wigs.

18:32.085 --> 18:33.245
Good work, Devon.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.810
Not good enough I'm afraid.

18:34.888 --> 18:37.152
Cdr. Smythe has had
a change of plans.

18:37.224 --> 18:38.851
He's arriving tomorrow.

18:38.925 --> 18:41.450
Michael, I'm a mature man.

18:41.962 --> 18:45.193
I handle human frailties
fairly well, even my own.

18:45.265 --> 18:48.894
But I have no intention of
facing the Commander car-less.

18:49.302 --> 18:50.667
I hear you.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.975
KITT, remember these letters:
"CB, JR, JW."

19:38.885 --> 19:41.752
Michael, I'm convinced
they're to a combination lock.

19:41.821 --> 19:44.415
But where that particular type
of lock is at the present

19:44.491 --> 19:46.186
is an entirely
different matter.

20:13.353 --> 20:14.718
All right.

20:15.355 --> 20:18.017
Let's see if only her
hairdresser knows for sure.

20:25.665 --> 20:27.565
Sorry, Michael.
As you can see,

20:27.634 --> 20:30.330
the hair from Suzanne's wig
is a coarse synthetic.

20:30.403 --> 20:31.893
It comes from a cheaper wig.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.767
There's more wigs
floating around here

20:34.874 --> 20:36.603
than in Miami Beach.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.441
Michael,

20:45.518 --> 20:47.850
the impossible once again
becomes commonplace.

20:47.921 --> 20:49.445
You got a fix on the lock?

20:49.522 --> 20:52.013
Better than that.
I can tell you where it is.

20:54.527 --> 20:55.619
CB.

20:56.363 --> 20:57.455
JR.

20:58.331 --> 21:00.629
JW.

21:08.742 --> 21:10.369
Okay. You better get lost.

22:03.797 --> 22:06.425
Michael, two vehicles
are approaching the warehouse.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.797
One is Suzanne,
the other an unknown cyclist,

22:08.902 --> 22:10.130
going around back.

22:10.170 --> 22:11.535
Thanks, pal.

22:32.058 --> 22:34.219
KITT, I'm around back,
cut him off.

22:42.902 --> 22:44.927
Hold it! Hold it!

22:45.071 --> 22:46.197
Stop!

23:01.254 --> 23:02.551
Carrie!

23:02.622 --> 23:04.852
I don't care what you think,
I'm innocent.

23:04.924 --> 23:07.552
I'm not guilty of anything.
Unlike you.

23:08.228 --> 23:09.718
What are you talking about?

23:09.796 --> 23:11.354
Suzanne Weston.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.023
I saw you
sneak out of her room

23:13.099 --> 23:14.760
after your nasty
little assignation.

23:14.834 --> 23:16.062
It wasn't what you think

23:16.136 --> 23:18.263
and if you're so innocent,
why are you here?

23:18.338 --> 23:20.329
I think Suzanne stole my car.

23:20.406 --> 23:22.374
Either stole it
or had it stolen.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.500
I don't trust her.

23:23.610 --> 23:26.044
Yeah.
I don't trust her either.

23:26.112 --> 23:27.636
Doesn't mean
she's guilty, does it?

23:27.747 --> 23:29.442
Besides, your car
isn't even in there.

23:29.516 --> 23:30.676
Just storage.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.479
You sound like
we're working together.

23:32.552 --> 23:33.814
Are we?

23:36.156 --> 23:37.384
Okay.

23:37.991 --> 23:39.686
For starters,
I got a good idea.

23:39.759 --> 23:40.783
What?

23:40.860 --> 23:44.421
If the thief isn't interested
in selling me a car,

23:45.331 --> 23:47.856
maybe he'd like to
steal one from me.

24:05.919 --> 24:07.216
How's this?

24:07.320 --> 24:08.787
Oh, that would be great.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.312
April, I can't believe

24:10.390 --> 24:12.415
you're participating
in this barbarism.

24:12.492 --> 24:14.460
Now, KITT, you know
we wouldn't be doing this

24:14.527 --> 24:16.427
if it weren't
absolutely necessary.

24:16.496 --> 24:19.431
How would you feel if someone
decided to extend your nose,

24:19.499 --> 24:21.399
remove your ears,
lengthen your neck

24:21.467 --> 24:23.526
and paint your body
candy-apple red?

24:23.603 --> 24:25.366
Thank goodness
Wilton Knight isn't here

24:25.438 --> 24:26.928
to see this sacrilege.

24:31.077 --> 24:32.476
Yo, Devon.

24:32.579 --> 24:35.241
Michael, have you made
any progress at all?

24:35.315 --> 24:37.943
Uh, that depends on
how you define progress.

24:38.017 --> 24:40.679
I define it as recovering
the Pennington.

24:40.753 --> 24:42.584
In that case, no.

24:43.022 --> 24:44.717
But I've come up
with a new approach.

24:44.791 --> 24:46.486
I've decided
to change tactics.

24:46.559 --> 24:49.619
While you're changing tactics,
I'm running out of time.

24:49.696 --> 24:52.722
Cdr. Smythe is due here
in less than 24 hours.

24:52.999 --> 24:54.694
Maybe you can stall him.

24:54.767 --> 24:57.327
My dear boy, one does not
stall the Commander.

24:57.403 --> 24:59.394
One tries to survive him.

25:00.506 --> 25:02.872
Lt. Miles, attention!

25:06.379 --> 25:08.609
Did you see
the look on his face?

25:08.715 --> 25:11.206
I think you're both being
extremely insensitive

25:11.251 --> 25:13.276
to the humiliation
involved here.

25:13.353 --> 25:14.479
You mean Devon's?

25:14.554 --> 25:15.680
Mine.

25:15.755 --> 25:18.349
Well, KITT,
think of it this way.

25:19.125 --> 25:22.117
Even as we speak,
innocent, beautiful cars,

25:22.195 --> 25:23.924
are being stolen
and customized

25:23.997 --> 25:25.157
against their will.

25:25.231 --> 25:26.596
Against their will?

25:26.666 --> 25:28.258
Against their will.

25:28.334 --> 25:31.326
In that case, we've
no time to lose. Proceed.

25:43.149 --> 25:45.447
The odds on the Longhorn
are even money, boys.

25:45.518 --> 25:47.679
Even money. Bet 100 to win 90.

25:48.154 --> 25:49.746
There's a 10 percent vig.

25:49.822 --> 25:51.517
You think I do this
just to win friends

25:51.591 --> 25:52.888
and influence people?

25:53.326 --> 25:55.624
Well, put me down for 1,000.

25:57.130 --> 26:00.156
You better run a good book,
Dobie, know what I mean?

26:00.233 --> 26:02.633
Because the Longhorn
is a shoe-in.

26:03.436 --> 26:05.097
Can I use the hot tub later?

26:05.171 --> 26:06.798
Over my dead body.

26:08.007 --> 26:10.976
Did you hear anything
about a last-minute entry?

26:11.044 --> 26:12.068
No.

26:30.196 --> 26:32.357
My entrance fee's
still good, isn't it?

26:32.432 --> 26:35.993
Oh, no way. No ringers.
No late entries.

26:36.402 --> 26:38.962
It's not exactly
a late entry, Mr. Rayburn.

26:39.072 --> 26:41.540
Carrie had a car registered,
and it was stolen.

26:41.607 --> 26:43.302
This car's just
taking its place.

26:45.478 --> 26:46.604
Well?

26:47.347 --> 26:48.814
She paid her entrance fee

26:48.915 --> 26:51.247
so the car
is allowed to compete.

26:56.489 --> 26:59.049
Well, it's just a car.
What are you looking at?

26:59.959 --> 27:01.017
Step right up.

27:01.094 --> 27:02.254
It's just a car.

27:11.704 --> 27:12.864
Show off.

27:22.615 --> 27:25.311
That's what I call
a mean machine.

27:26.552 --> 27:28.577
There isn't a cheerleader
in the world

27:28.654 --> 27:31.316
you couldn't get
with that car, Hector.

27:35.395 --> 27:36.794
And did you see Rayburn?

27:36.863 --> 27:38.990
He looked like he was
going to jump out of his skin

27:39.065 --> 27:40.464
and fly all the way
back to Texas.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.899
He could do that
on his wife's broomstick.

27:45.338 --> 27:47.203
Have I thanked you
for all your help?

27:47.306 --> 27:49.297
Yeah. In your own way.

27:50.376 --> 27:52.241
Well, I'm not quite
sure what that means,

27:52.311 --> 27:54.176
but, uh,
it doesn't sound right.

27:54.247 --> 27:55.578
I mean, it seems to me

27:55.648 --> 27:57.707
that I should thank
a person in his way.

27:58.618 --> 28:00.643
What is your way, Michael?

28:00.920 --> 28:03.548
I'll tell you what.
If our plan works,

28:03.623 --> 28:05.818
and the thief tries
to steal KITT tonight,

28:05.892 --> 28:07.120
you can thank me.

28:08.161 --> 28:10.152
I don't think
you answered my question.

28:11.364 --> 28:13.127
So I'm just
gonna have to guess.

28:14.367 --> 28:15.857
Get down here.

28:18.371 --> 28:19.565
Close?

28:21.941 --> 28:22.999
Real close.

28:24.210 --> 28:26.075
See you tomorrow,
crack of dawn.

28:26.145 --> 28:27.612
I'll be ready.

28:41.828 --> 28:43.986
Hi.

28:44.597 --> 28:45.996
What are you doing here?

28:46.065 --> 28:47.760
Oh, I thought
it was time for us

28:47.834 --> 28:49.392
to pick up
where we left off.

28:49.469 --> 28:51.460
Yeah, well, Suzanne,
this whole thing.

28:51.537 --> 28:53.562
I'm telling you,
it's not the way it looks.

28:53.673 --> 28:56.608
I take pride in making
myself perfectly clear.

28:56.676 --> 28:58.041
It's not worth it.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.806
Why are we getting
in all this trouble?

28:59.879 --> 29:01.073
Do you trust me?

29:01.147 --> 29:03.377
Will you just trust me?
It is worth it.

29:03.449 --> 29:05.474
It is worth it.
Will you just listen?

29:05.551 --> 29:07.280
I'm no- I'm no good
at this kind of stuff.

29:07.386 --> 29:08.614
We ain't in no trouble.

29:08.654 --> 29:10.349
We only get in trouble
if we get caught.

29:10.423 --> 29:12.050
And we ain't gonna
get caught, Hector.

29:20.266 --> 29:21.426
What's that?

29:21.501 --> 29:24.334
That? Oh, that, uh...

29:24.904 --> 29:27.168
That is a computer watch.

29:27.740 --> 29:30.937
And it reminds me that
I've gotta take some pills.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.169
Well, you look
perfectly healthy to me.

29:33.279 --> 29:35.179
It's a miracle
of modern medicine.

29:39.485 --> 29:40.816
KITT, what is it?

29:40.887 --> 29:42.286
We've got a bite,
Michael.

29:42.355 --> 29:44.550
Two stealthy figures
are approaching me.

29:44.690 --> 29:45.918
Uh, you handle it.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.721
I'll be out there
as soon as I can.

29:54.901 --> 29:57.096
I think it's time
we had a nice little talk.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.967
Michael whoever-you-are.

29:59.038 --> 30:01.199
All right, what
do you want to talk about?

30:01.841 --> 30:03.741
Who you are. Why you're here.

30:03.809 --> 30:04.935
I told you.

30:05.044 --> 30:06.636
Then let's be
more specific.

30:06.746 --> 30:08.441
Because, I also saw you
skulking around

30:08.481 --> 30:09.948
the warehouse I rented.

30:11.150 --> 30:12.879
I'll tell you what.

30:13.286 --> 30:15.117
You give me the gun,

30:15.555 --> 30:17.318
and I'll give you an answer.

30:17.690 --> 30:20.853
Suzanne, Grand Theft Auto
is one thing.

30:22.061 --> 30:24.029
But you really
don't want to shoot me.

30:47.286 --> 30:49.811
Oh, good move, Hector.
You just woke half the town.

30:49.889 --> 30:52.221
How come I always
have to carry everything?

30:52.391 --> 30:54.985
Look, let's just forget
the whole thing.

30:55.094 --> 30:56.755
So far
all they have on us

30:56.829 --> 30:58.490
is intent to disturb
the peace.

30:59.265 --> 31:01.529
That's a humiliation,
disturbing the peace.

31:01.601 --> 31:03.967
What do you get
if you disturb the peace?

31:04.470 --> 31:05.869
If I'm gonna get busted,

31:05.972 --> 31:08.065
I'd rather get busted
for Grand Theft Auto.

31:08.174 --> 31:10.039
At least it's got substance.

31:10.109 --> 31:13.135
At least they know
you were going for something.

31:13.246 --> 31:15.976
Now, bend the hangers.
Bend the hangers.

31:20.386 --> 31:22.377
Oh, dear,
what a disappointment.

31:22.455 --> 31:24.423
Small fish in a small pond.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.985
Well, I guess
that old saying is true.

31:30.062 --> 31:31.996
Oh, yeah? What's that?

31:32.064 --> 31:34.089
Truth is stranger
than fiction.

31:34.367 --> 31:37.768
Stranger but not nearly
as interesting.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.265
For what it's worth,

31:40.373 --> 31:42.773
I hope you find
whoever stole your boss' car.

31:43.142 --> 31:44.507
As the owner of a car show,

31:44.577 --> 31:46.841
I hate the thefts
as much as anybody else.

31:46.912 --> 31:49.642
We build our image
on good, clean family fun.

31:54.587 --> 31:57.351
And if you're ever in the mood
for the other kind,

31:59.025 --> 32:00.822
you know where
you can find me.

32:08.034 --> 32:10.468
Oh, yeah, KITT,
what's happening?

32:10.703 --> 32:12.330
False alarm, Michael.

32:12.405 --> 32:13.770
I thought somebody
was after you.

32:13.873 --> 32:15.841
They were. Are, actually.

32:15.908 --> 32:18.308
The trouble is they're not
professional thieves.

32:18.377 --> 32:19.435
How do you know?

32:19.545 --> 32:21.035
They're trying to gain entry

32:21.147 --> 32:23.809
with a coat hanger
and a Phillips screwdriver.

32:29.455 --> 32:31.650
I can't figure this out
for the life of me.

32:32.258 --> 32:33.816
Let's go home, Leroy.

32:33.893 --> 32:36.088
There's no cheerleader
worth any of this.

32:37.530 --> 32:39.794
I got an idea.
No! Guaranteed to work.

32:39.865 --> 32:41.127
Come on, get the box.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.065
How come I always
got to carry the toolbox?

32:43.135 --> 32:44.432
Come on.
How come?

32:48.407 --> 32:50.398
Well, Michael,
the night is still young.

32:50.509 --> 32:52.033
Those two baboons have gone

32:52.144 --> 32:54.544
and there's still time
to catch the real thief.

32:54.613 --> 32:56.672
Yeah. Let's hope so,
for Devon's sake.

32:57.083 --> 32:59.643
You did what
with the Pennington?

32:59.719 --> 33:02.984
I, uh, had her
entered in a car show.

33:04.890 --> 33:08.223
You put the Pennington
Ascot Regency on display,

33:08.661 --> 33:10.322
before commoners?

33:10.696 --> 33:12.687
Well, you see, Henry, I, uh,

33:12.765 --> 33:15.893
I felt that all that beauty,
all that majesty,

33:16.602 --> 33:19.264
ought to be shared
with the rest of the world,

33:19.338 --> 33:21.203
to brighten
the colorless lives

33:21.307 --> 33:23.775
of the deprived,
of the, uh, less fortunate.

33:27.179 --> 33:30.580
Yes, I... I suppose
I can see what you mean.

33:30.649 --> 33:31.741
You can?

33:31.817 --> 33:33.978
Why, that's absolutely
wonderful.

33:34.053 --> 33:36.044
What good news
for the masses.

33:36.122 --> 33:37.419
Take me to
the show at once.

33:37.490 --> 33:38.514
Take you?

33:38.591 --> 33:40.616
Henry,
it's up in Barton Springs,

33:40.693 --> 33:43.856
quite a fair journey
and it's already very late.

33:44.597 --> 33:47.998
Uh, look. What do you say,
let's relax for the evening.

33:48.067 --> 33:50.433
And we'll get a fresh start
first thing in the morning.

33:50.503 --> 33:52.869
We'll arrive in plenty
of time for the judging.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.008
Nothing wrong, is there?

33:57.243 --> 33:59.234
Wrong? Certainly not.

33:59.879 --> 34:02.109
What on earth could
possibly be wrong?

34:31.043 --> 34:33.806
I see there's only one way
to get rid of you two.

34:38.551 --> 34:39.916
You did it.

34:40.052 --> 34:41.849
I told you. Come on.

34:49.829 --> 34:52.696
Wow, look at that dash.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.164
TV set and all.

34:55.234 --> 34:57.259
Didn't I tell you
this car was special?

34:57.336 --> 34:58.928
You can say that again.

35:13.919 --> 35:15.216
Will you slow down?

35:15.287 --> 35:17.551
I'm not doing it, Hector!
It's driving itself!

35:17.623 --> 35:18.920
Shall we take
the scenic route,

35:18.991 --> 35:20.151
or are you in a hurry?

35:20.226 --> 35:21.591
Who said that?

35:21.660 --> 35:23.059
Let's get out of here!

35:23.128 --> 35:24.186
No, you don't.

35:24.263 --> 35:25.730
You wanted to steal a car,

35:25.798 --> 35:28.232
and now you've stolen
the ride of your lives.

35:38.410 --> 35:40.207
Let me out of here!

35:58.864 --> 35:59.888
Remember this

35:59.965 --> 36:02.024
the next time you think
about stealing a car.

36:02.101 --> 36:03.159
Yes, sir.

36:03.235 --> 36:04.532
Now get lost.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.029
Hector.

36:09.141 --> 36:10.301
You carry it
this time.

36:10.409 --> 36:11.398
Goodbye.

36:11.510 --> 36:13.808
I'm-I'm go- I'm going.
I'm going.

36:13.879 --> 36:15.540
And good riddance.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.335
You better hurry up.

36:44.843 --> 36:45.935
Well.

36:46.312 --> 36:47.779
How do I look?

36:47.980 --> 36:50.540
Oh, what do you think
that black beauty's worth?

36:50.616 --> 36:52.516
Oh. About $75,000.

36:52.952 --> 36:56.285
You look like $75,000.

37:10.269 --> 37:13.295
Ah! There's nothing quite like
getting an early start

37:13.405 --> 37:14.736
to awaken the senses.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.308
The crisp,
clear smell of the dawn.

37:18.477 --> 37:21.037
It makes you yearn for
the war years, huh, Devon?

37:21.146 --> 37:24.047
Leading a bristled
gaggle of men into battle.

37:24.116 --> 37:26.778
The clash of steel
against steel, by george.

37:28.921 --> 37:31.082
Uh, steel against steel,
yes, quite.

37:31.757 --> 37:34.692
Still, we have plenty
of time for breakfast.

37:34.927 --> 37:36.827
A leisurely breakfast.

37:36.996 --> 37:39.897
Well, I've waited this long
to drive the old girl.

37:39.965 --> 37:42.900
I suppose I could
wait a little longer.

37:43.402 --> 37:44.699
Oh, good.

37:45.170 --> 37:48.537
You don't suppose they could
find any kippers, do you?

37:54.813 --> 37:55.871
Well.

37:55.981 --> 37:59.382
Looks like the amateurs didn't
do too much damage, huh?

37:59.451 --> 38:01.351
Michael, I am
more than capable

38:01.420 --> 38:02.910
of solving most problems

38:02.988 --> 38:05.252
intelligently
and scientifically.

38:05.324 --> 38:06.814
Oh, yeah? What did you do?

38:06.925 --> 38:08.893
Scared their socks off.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.168
Do you think this plan
will work, Michael?

38:17.236 --> 38:19.466
I certainly hope so.

38:24.643 --> 38:26.702
There's someone
approaching us, Michael.

38:26.812 --> 38:27.801
Male or female?

38:27.913 --> 38:30.677
Female. To be
more specific, blonde.

38:31.750 --> 38:32.910
Bingo.

38:54.473 --> 38:55.997
How unpleasant.

38:56.108 --> 38:58.576
Think about how
all the other cars feel.

38:58.644 --> 39:00.009
They dent.

39:14.693 --> 39:17.685
...how sorry I am. It
really is just all my fault.

39:18.864 --> 39:20.729
I'm just glad
nobody was hurt.

39:20.799 --> 39:22.266
You aren't hurt,
are you?

39:22.334 --> 39:24.268
No, no, I'm fine.

39:24.336 --> 39:25.769
Oh.
Not a scratch.

39:25.838 --> 39:26.998
Thank goodness.

39:27.106 --> 39:29.199
I mean, these days
you don't know who to trust.

39:29.308 --> 39:32.004
Some people just yell whiplash
if you just wave at them.

39:33.712 --> 39:36.272
Well, my insurance company
will pay for any damage

39:36.348 --> 39:37.440
to your car.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.153
Well, uh...

39:46.258 --> 39:47.885
Looks like you got off lucky.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.086
Yeah.

39:49.795 --> 39:52.525
Well, you know, here could be
some internal damage here.

39:52.598 --> 39:55.431
Maybe I'd better get the name
of your insurance company.

39:55.501 --> 39:57.162
Just to be
on the safe side.

39:57.236 --> 39:59.602
Internal damage.
Of course. Yes.

39:59.705 --> 40:01.832
Oh, would you be a dear
and get me my purse.

40:01.940 --> 40:04.704
I'm just shaking so.
I left it on the front seat.

40:04.810 --> 40:06.072
Sure. No problem.

40:06.145 --> 40:08.045
Oh, thank you very much.

40:13.318 --> 40:14.580
You sure
it's in the car?

40:15.821 --> 40:17.448
I can't find it.

40:36.141 --> 40:37.369
It worked. Who is it?

40:37.476 --> 40:38.500
You'll never guess.

40:38.610 --> 40:39.634
Michael!

40:39.745 --> 40:41.212
Nora Rayburn.

40:50.022 --> 40:51.683
You're very nice.

40:54.660 --> 40:57.390
Kindly keep your hands
to yourself, madam.

40:57.462 --> 40:58.588
What?

41:00.098 --> 41:02.862
Oh. I see.
One of those talking cars.

41:03.635 --> 41:06.069
"Your fuel is low. "
"Please close your door. "

41:07.172 --> 41:08.366
How unnerving.

41:08.473 --> 41:10.441
You ain't seen nothing yet.

41:10.509 --> 41:11.976
Wait a minute.

41:12.077 --> 41:14.875
They don't program cars
with bad grammar.

41:32.564 --> 41:33.963
Open that door.

41:34.032 --> 41:35.056
When the truck comes,

41:35.133 --> 41:37.101
I want these moved out
as soon as possible.

41:38.103 --> 41:41.038
Oh! Ain't it beautiful.
It's just beautiful!

41:42.040 --> 41:43.132
Nora.

41:43.575 --> 41:46.373
Oh, I wouldn't know
what to do without you.

41:46.445 --> 41:47.878
Did you have
any trouble?

41:47.946 --> 41:49.345
Not at all.

41:50.015 --> 41:52.347
But it's a real
strange car, though.

41:53.185 --> 41:54.948
I mean it speaks
horrible English

41:55.020 --> 41:56.920
and it practically
drives itself.

41:57.189 --> 41:59.555
Well, that's
the power steering, honey.

42:00.025 --> 42:01.185
Umm...

42:01.260 --> 42:02.488
I don't know.

42:11.937 --> 42:13.564
We're ready
when they get here, boss.

42:13.672 --> 42:15.037
Load this one last.

42:16.475 --> 42:19.000
There's my car!
They stole my car!

42:23.181 --> 42:25.240
Come on!
Get out of the way!

42:28.120 --> 42:29.610
You stay here.

42:30.989 --> 42:32.047
KITT.

42:33.725 --> 42:35.352
Back up.

42:38.764 --> 42:39.924
Now.

43:40.325 --> 43:41.349
Carrie!

43:41.426 --> 43:43.223
Hey, Michael, over here.

43:43.295 --> 43:44.557
You okay?

43:44.629 --> 43:46.096
Oh, I'm fine.

44:10.422 --> 44:14.085
You there! Pull over!
Pull over, I say.

44:29.574 --> 44:32.202
We gotta stop him
before he causes an accident.

44:32.310 --> 44:33.572
I got an idea.

44:33.645 --> 44:35.203
Michael, you can't be thinking

44:35.313 --> 44:37.178
of turbo boosting
over the Longhorn.

45:00.672 --> 45:01.764
Come on.

45:05.343 --> 45:07.243
It is amazing, isn't it?

45:22.928 --> 45:24.156
Carrie!

45:25.297 --> 45:28.027
Got you.
You conniving customizer.

45:30.001 --> 45:31.195
We did it!

45:31.269 --> 45:32.702
Oh!

45:32.771 --> 45:34.261
We sure did.
Oh.

45:40.479 --> 45:42.174
You stay where you are,
Michael.

45:42.247 --> 45:44.943
Oil may strike you
as hilarious, but not me.

45:50.889 --> 45:51.913
Help!

45:51.990 --> 45:53.116
KITT.

45:55.026 --> 45:57.290
KITT. Now, cut it out.

45:57.829 --> 45:59.091
Hey, I mean it!

45:59.164 --> 46:00.859
You two
are not getting into me

46:00.932 --> 46:03.127
until you have
a thorough steam-cleaning.

46:03.235 --> 46:05.703
Hey! Hey,
come back here! KITT!

46:18.083 --> 46:20.381
Devon, I have seen
this car twice now.

46:20.452 --> 46:21.976
Where is my Pennington?

46:22.053 --> 46:24.112
Have I shown you
the customized Packard?

46:24.189 --> 46:25.850
Yes. Devon, I insist

46:25.924 --> 46:27.858
you take me to
the Pennington immediately.

46:32.664 --> 46:34.188
And so I shall.

46:42.474 --> 46:43.668
Hello.

46:44.209 --> 46:47.007
I just wanted to
polish her up a little.

46:47.212 --> 46:49.680
She is a sight,
I must say.

46:49.781 --> 46:51.214
You're quite right,
Devon.

46:51.283 --> 46:54.013
Everyone should
experience her beauty.

46:55.453 --> 46:57.853
Michael!
Michael, I won!

46:57.923 --> 46:59.151
I won!

47:00.659 --> 47:01.990
Fantastic.

47:02.394 --> 47:04.453
Oh, I don't know
how to thank you.

47:04.930 --> 47:06.522
I'm still going
to think of a way.

47:06.631 --> 47:08.599
I bet you will.
I'll see you later.

47:08.633 --> 47:09.657
Okay.

47:12.604 --> 47:13.764
Thank you.

47:15.907 --> 47:17.067
Good work, Michael.

47:17.175 --> 47:18.665
Thanks, Devon.

47:21.313 --> 47:22.974
Are you all right?

47:23.415 --> 47:26.384
I'm all right as long as
I don't move from this spot.

47:26.451 --> 47:27.543
Oh.

47:28.019 --> 47:29.111
I see.

47:29.187 --> 47:31.519
Well, I'm sure that
you'll think of something.

47:31.590 --> 47:33.683
And I'll see you
back at the semi.

47:33.758 --> 47:36.283
I must say,
she's a beauty, isn't she?

47:36.361 --> 47:38.989
Look here.
Don't crowd around like that.

47:39.064 --> 47:40.793
I say, don't touch!

47:42.634 --> 47:43.692
Oh.

47:44.502 --> 47:46.094
I almost forgot.

47:47.639 --> 47:48.867
For you.

47:50.075 --> 47:52.839
"Honorable Mention"?
How insulting.

47:53.044 --> 47:55.035
Don't take it
too personally, pal.

47:55.146 --> 47:57.137
You know
how these contests are.

47:57.415 --> 47:58.746
All political.

47:58.817 --> 48:01.684
I'd like to give those judges
a piece of my mind.
