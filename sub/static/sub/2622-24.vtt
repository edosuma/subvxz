00:02.293 --> 00:03.544
Previously on Friends:

00:03.711 --> 00:05.796
- I can't believe you won't be there.
- I know.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.798
Why can't you take a couple of days off?

00:07.966 --> 00:10.217
- Because I can't.
- This is my wedding.

00:11.302 --> 00:14.054
- I can't wait to see it.
- Her parents got married there.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.099
It's the most beautiful place.
It's right over...

00:17.475 --> 00:19.059
Oh, my God!

00:19.227 --> 00:21.979
The only thing I understand is
postponing is not an option.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.689
This wedding is not gonna happen.

00:24.733 --> 00:29.695
If you don't love this, then we'll do it
any other place or time. It's fine.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.530
It's perfect.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.323
- I'm going to London.
- What?

00:33.491 --> 00:35.784
It's not over until someone says, "I do."

00:35.952 --> 00:37.953
I do! I do! I do!

00:38.121 --> 00:39.621
Rachel, no!

00:44.878 --> 00:46.712
The Waltham residence.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.380
Hi, is this Emily's parents' house?

00:48.548 --> 00:50.632
This is the housekeeper.

00:50.800 --> 00:55.679
And, by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.640
First one identifies oneself...

00:58.808 --> 01:03.020
...and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.438
Um, this is Phoebe Buffay.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.441
I was wondering, please...

01:07.609 --> 01:09.693
...if it's not too much trouble, please...

01:09.861 --> 01:13.280
...um, might I speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

01:13.948 --> 01:16.784
Miss Waltham is
at the rehearsal dinner.

01:16.951 --> 01:20.579
And it is not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.915
No, no! I'll be nice, I swear.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.125
Could you just give me their number?

01:25.293 --> 01:28.837
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

01:29.005 --> 01:33.717
Somebody is on their way to ruin the wedding,
and I have to warn them.

01:33.885 --> 01:36.637
So give me that number
or I'll come over there...

01:36.805 --> 01:41.391
...and I'll kick your snooty ass
all the way to New Gloukenshire!

01:42.769 --> 01:44.144
Hello? Hello? Oh!

01:44.312 --> 01:47.439
Ooh, she knew I could kick her ass.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.409
Hi, sweetheart.

02:40.618 --> 02:43.036
Mom, Dad.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.621
Oh, sorry, we're late.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.999
My fault. I insisted on riding the tube.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.293
Judy, the kids!

02:49.711 --> 02:52.546
That's what they call the subway.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.755
Oh!

02:53.923 --> 02:54.965
I thought...

02:55.133 --> 02:57.301
Dad, we got it.

02:57.468 --> 03:00.053
Oh! Here comes my dad and stepmom.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.430
Mr. And Mrs. Geller.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.515
This is Steven...

03:03.683 --> 03:05.225
...and Andrea Waltham.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.352
How do you do? Very nice to meet you.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.396
- Ha, ha!
- Eh, darling, the Gellers.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.315
Darling, it's the Gellers.

03:11.482 --> 03:15.152
She's self-involved.
I should never have married her.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.030
- Sorry, what?
- It's the Gellers.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.991
- Where?
- That's one and that's another one.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.785
Lovely to meet you.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.246
Nice of you to pay
for half the wedding.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.957
Oh, the hell with tradition!
We're happy to do it.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.960
Oh, we know how expensive
weddings can be.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.172
Besides, this may be
the only wedding we get to throw.

03:35.673 --> 03:36.757
Ahem, ha, ha.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.092
A joke that's funny in all countries.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.014
Sir?

03:44.474 --> 03:48.018
- What's in it?
- Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.232
That's not food.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.192
No, I don't want it.

03:56.986 --> 04:00.072
Everything's different here.
I want to go home.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.700
I miss my family, the coffeehouse.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.245
I can't remember
what Phoebe looks like!

04:07.622 --> 04:08.914
Joey, it's been three days.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.457
Oh.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.542
Okay, you're just a little homesick.

04:12.710 --> 04:16.255
Would you just try to relax
and just enjoy yourself?

04:16.839 --> 04:18.966
You're different here too.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.344
You're mean in England!

04:23.638 --> 04:24.972
What the hell?

04:25.139 --> 04:26.181
What's up, Dad?

04:26.349 --> 04:29.142
This bill for my half. It's insane.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.895
Why is it so much?
The reception's at their house.

04:32.063 --> 04:36.108
Flowers, liquor. Re-carpet first floor?

04:36.276 --> 04:39.027
New guest bath, landscaping.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.446
I'm paying to remodel this house.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.533
I'll give that son of a bitch
a piece of my mind.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.243
Dad. Please.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.079
I don't want anything to upset Emily.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.291
She's had a hard enough
couple of days as it is.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.668
Here. Let me go talk to him.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.129
You tell him no one takes advantage
of the Gellers.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.840
Ooh, Jack.

05:01.217 --> 05:04.094
Sometimes I forget
how powerful you can be.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.142
And I'll go get drunk.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.064
Oh! Oh! Oh!

05:16.232 --> 05:18.150
- Hi.
- Hello.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.484
Hello.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.695
Um, when is your next flight to London?

05:21.863 --> 05:24.239
- There's one leaving in 30 minutes.
- Oh!

05:24.407 --> 05:26.908
And I do have one seat left.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.618
Oh, thank you, thank you.

05:28.786 --> 05:32.831
The last-minute fare
on this ticket is $2700.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.835
Ugh. I don't have enough left
on my credit card.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.504
You can split it with another card.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.590
Okay, how about five?

05:43.301 --> 05:44.760
Oh, thank you.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.387
I need to see your passport.

05:50.224 --> 05:54.644
I don't have it, but I can tell you
where it is on my nightstand.

05:56.814 --> 05:59.733
You know what?
I have my driver's license.

05:59.901 --> 06:04.029
And I have a 20.

06:07.992 --> 06:11.578
Face it, my father is not gonna pay
for the built-in barbecue.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.956
And believe me, you can
kiss your gazebo goodbye.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.669
I might be able
to get you the new lawn.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.631
Ah! Then you have to give us
the lawn ornaments.

06:23.508 --> 06:27.427
I go back there with lawn ornaments,
he'll laugh in my face.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.598
Will you say something, Steven?

06:32.642 --> 06:35.936
Don't take that tone with me.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.272
All right, you can.

06:42.276 --> 06:45.070
- Hi, Pheebs.
- Oh, thank God!

06:45.321 --> 06:47.572
Oh, you changed your mind. Ugh!

06:47.740 --> 06:50.450
You probably don't want
to talk about it.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.619
You're doing the right thing.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.163
- Bye, Pheebs.
- Where are you going?

06:55.373 --> 06:56.790
What are you doing? No, wait.

06:57.792 --> 07:01.294
Why am I always pregnant
when she does that?

07:03.673 --> 07:05.715
I'd like to toast Ross and Emily.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.843
My big toast is tomorrow.

07:08.010 --> 07:12.180
This is kind of my little toast,
or Melba toast, if you will.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.435
Okay.

07:16.602 --> 07:21.565
Ahem. I knew Ross when he was, uh,
going out with his first girlfriend.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.774
Oh, heh.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.360
I thought things would work out
until he over-inflated her.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.617
Oh, dear God!

07:35.746 --> 07:37.706
Hello, Waltham Interiors.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.374
Oh! Hi, Mrs. Waltham.

07:39.542 --> 07:43.336
I need to speak with, um,
one of the best men or Ross' sister.

07:43.921 --> 07:48.133
- Who is this?
- Oh, Phoebe, one of Ross' best friends.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.594
If you're Ross' friend,
why aren't you here?

07:50.761 --> 07:54.723
Um, I can't fly.
I'm having my brother's babies.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.644
Oh.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.938
Am I on the radio?

08:02.648 --> 08:04.149
No. Um...

08:04.317 --> 08:06.943
...can I talk to one of them?
It's important.

08:07.111 --> 08:10.238
I'm bored of you now.
I'm going to cut you off.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.740
Oh!

08:11.908 --> 08:16.953
We're excited that, uh, Ross and Emily
are getting married at Montgomery Hall.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.998
To think, my friend getting
married in Monty Hall.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.334
Oh, come on, Monty Hall!

08:22.502 --> 08:25.462
Let's Make a Deal.
Come on, you people!

08:26.422 --> 08:29.341
All right, forget it.
Congratulations, Ross and Emily.

08:33.011 --> 08:37.097
Hey. Best man number two,
Joey Tribbiani. Ha, ha.

08:37.265 --> 08:39.518
I'm not good with the jokes
like Chandler here.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.688
But, uh...

08:43.856 --> 08:46.608
...congratulations to the happy couple.

08:47.276 --> 08:51.196
I first met Ross
in this coffeehouse back home.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.496
Home.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.249
New York City.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.751
Where everybody knows my name.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.588
Uh, anyway...

09:08.756 --> 09:11.091
...uh, I love you guys.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.386
But not as much as I love America.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.224
Can we please go home now?

09:20.268 --> 09:22.018
Are you going home?

09:22.186 --> 09:24.771
I was hoping to get
to know you better.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.650
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.947
I was laughing.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.616
Out loud?

09:37.785 --> 09:40.745
I didn't want everyone
to think I was stupid.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.622
So how are you doing?

09:42.790 --> 09:45.417
My mom's driving me crazy.
But Ross is getting married!

09:45.585 --> 09:47.335
I'm happy. I won't let anything spoil that.

09:48.713 --> 09:49.754
Mm-hm.

09:49.922 --> 09:53.842
I just want to say that
Ross is a wonderful young man.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.137
Oh, thanks. We like him. Ha, ha.

09:57.305 --> 10:01.224
My God! You must have been
a teenager when you had him.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.772
There's no way in hell I'm paying for it.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.525
Look, we're down to just one point.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.987
Could we please just settle it
after the wedding?

10:14.155 --> 10:17.532
Fine, but I'm not paying
for your wine cellar...

10:17.700 --> 10:22.162
...you thieving, would-be-speaking-
German-if-it-weren't-for-us man!

10:27.126 --> 10:31.046
The guy was hammered.
There's no way you look like Ross' mother.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.091
- Then why would he say it?
- Because he's crazy!

10:35.259 --> 10:39.596
Earlier, he thanked me for my very
moving performance in Titanic.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.435
My mother's right. I'll never get married.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.021
Ha! You know what, that is...

10:48.272 --> 10:50.357
Who wouldn't want you?

10:50.524 --> 10:53.860
Please! I'm a single mom
with a 30-year-old son.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.867
I'm getting married today!

11:01.035 --> 11:02.118
Whoo! Heh.

11:02.787 --> 11:03.870
Morning.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.122
I'm getting married today!

11:06.290 --> 11:08.958
- Yeah, you are.
- Woo-hoo!

11:10.294 --> 11:12.420
Do you think he knew I was here?

11:20.554 --> 11:24.057
I've never done that with you before. Heh.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.934
Nope. Ha, ha.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.186
So, uh, how are you?

11:28.354 --> 11:29.979
You okay?

11:30.481 --> 11:31.523
Yeah, yeah.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.108
- You?
- Oh, yes, yes.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.859
Uh-huh.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.152
You?

11:37.655 --> 11:39.239
We did you.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.491
Hmm.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.368
Well...

11:44.203 --> 11:47.372
- I better get going.
- Oh, absolutely. Ha, ha.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.376
Could you not look?

11:51.752 --> 11:53.420
I don't want to look.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.440
- Uh, uh, excuse me.
- Yeah.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.900
If you're planning on doing that
the entire flight...

12:16.068 --> 12:19.154
...please tell me now
so that I can take a sedative.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.406
Or maybe slip you one.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.285
It's just, I'm, uh, kind of excited.

12:25.453 --> 12:29.789
I'm, um, going to London
to, uh, tell this guy that I love him.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.388
- Hello.
- Where the hell have you been?

12:45.556 --> 12:46.598
Hey.

12:46.766 --> 12:51.352
I spent the night out.
I met this cute bridesmaid. She is...

12:51.520 --> 12:52.812
I don't want to hear it!

12:52.980 --> 12:56.441
Aw, Pheebs, you know you're still
my number one girl.

12:57.401 --> 13:01.237
We have an emergency.
Rachel's coming to London.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.156
Oh, great!

13:03.699 --> 13:07.535
No, she's coming to tell Ross
that she loves him.

13:07.703 --> 13:08.828
But he loves Emily.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.705
I know that!

13:11.415 --> 13:14.209
You have to stop her.
She's going to ruin the wedding.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.377
Okay.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.505
I've done my part, okay?

13:18.672 --> 13:22.008
It's your responsibility now.
The burden is off me.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.384
Right.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.887
So tell me about this girl.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.142
Hey. Have you seen Monica?

13:31.310 --> 13:32.894
I'm not seeing Monica.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.608
- What?
- What?

13:38.776 --> 13:39.901
Look, we gotta find her.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.862
Phoebe called. Rachel's coming
to tell Ross she loves him.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.073
- Oh, my God.
- I know. We gotta find Monica.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.658
- Know where she is?
- No, okay?

13:46.826 --> 13:50.370
What's with the third degree?
Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?

13:53.165 --> 13:56.334
Then I realized all this stuff
I had been doing...

13:56.502 --> 14:00.588
...proposing to Joshua,
lying about why I couldn't come...

14:00.756 --> 14:03.550
...was all just a way of...
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

14:04.301 --> 14:06.052
I'm sorry. Can I interrupt?

14:06.220 --> 14:11.641
I just want to say that you are
a horrible, horrible person.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.227
Pardon me?

14:14.395 --> 14:17.981
You're about to ruin
the happiest day of his life.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.441
I have to agree
with your friend Pheebs.

14:20.609 --> 14:24.028
This is a terrible, terrible plan.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.657
- But he has to know how I feel.
- But why?

14:27.825 --> 14:30.869
He loves this Emily.
No good can come of this.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.830
Ugh! I think you're wrong.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.999
Oh, no!

14:38.794 --> 14:42.046
By the way, it seems to be clear
you were on a break.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.893
Oh, my God!

14:55.060 --> 14:57.520
It's like a fairyland.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.856
I know. It's horrible, isn't it?

15:00.524 --> 15:03.192
I love it. I only hope
my wedding looks this good.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.195
- Ha! I just hope...
- You can let some go by.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.908
Psst. Monica.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.035
Start looking out for Rachel.

15:12.202 --> 15:15.246
I'll cover the door.
You watch that big hole.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.415
I've got Chandler covering Ross.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.251
Why would I care where Chandler is? Heh.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.837
You know, uh...

15:23.839 --> 15:26.090
...sometimes I don't even like Chandler.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.551
- Okay.
- Heh.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.180
I do.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.559
I do.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.936
Oh, it's the second one.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.395
Right?

15:43.442 --> 15:44.484
Hello, Joey.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.819
Hey, Felicity.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.031
Um, I thought about you all day.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.574
- Yeah?
- Ha, ha.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.368
Talk New York to me again.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.372
- Forget about it.
- Heh.

15:57.539 --> 15:58.665
How you doing?

15:58.832 --> 16:00.124
- Mm!
- Ha-ha-ha.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.089
We're not paying
for your wine cellar.

16:06.256 --> 16:08.341
You have to meet me in the middle.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.386
My foot will meet
the middle of your ass.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.474
- What's going on?
- Oh, everything's under control.

16:16.642 --> 16:20.144
You want a piece of me?
Is that what you're saying?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.438
That's it!

16:22.606 --> 16:24.899
Parents! Parents! Back away!

16:25.067 --> 16:26.859
This is our wedding day!

16:27.361 --> 16:29.404
From now on, everyone gets along.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.864
And if I hear one more word...

16:32.032 --> 16:33.241
...no grandchildren!

16:33.409 --> 16:34.534
That's right!

16:34.702 --> 16:35.743
Okay, okay.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.078
Sorry, old boy.

16:37.287 --> 16:39.163
Sorry. Sorry.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.292
I could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.214
What was that about?

16:48.382 --> 16:51.342
It was this disagreement over...

16:53.220 --> 16:55.304
My God! You look beautiful.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.515
Oh!

16:57.683 --> 17:01.019
Oh! You can't see me
before the wedding. It's bad luck.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.939
I think we've had all the bad luck
we're going to have.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.227
My God, heh, Rachel!

17:45.731 --> 17:47.815
You're here. I can't believe it.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.817
- Ha.
- Uh...

17:50.652 --> 17:52.278
Why are you here?

17:52.446 --> 17:54.614
I just came to...

17:58.535 --> 18:01.079
I just needed to tell you...

18:03.499 --> 18:06.125
...congratulations.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.033
Waltham Interiors.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.619
Mrs. Waltham? It's Phoebe.

18:41.787 --> 18:46.249
Can I talk to one of the best men?
This is going to be the last time.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.502
There's a girl on the phone for you.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.879
Oh, great!

18:52.965 --> 18:54.006
Hello?

18:54.174 --> 18:55.508
It's Phoebe.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.552
Did you stop Rachel?

18:57.719 --> 18:59.762
But she just hugged him. That's it.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.181
- Nothing got ruined?
- No.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.933
Oh, that's so great!

19:04.101 --> 19:06.811
Oh! So, what's going on now?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.437
Uh...

19:08.605 --> 19:10.857
...I'm walking down the aisle.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.777
Still walking.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.781
Now I'm at the front with Ross.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.324
It's Phoebe!

19:24.913 --> 19:26.497
He looks pretty mad.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.749
Uh, I better go.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.419
Wait! Hold it up so I can listen.

19:38.635 --> 19:42.305
- What we did last night was...
- Stupid. Hmm.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.765
- Totally crazy, stupid.
- Ha, ha.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.393
What were we thinking? Heh.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.354
I'm coming over tonight though, right?

19:52.482 --> 19:53.608
Oh, yeah, definitely.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.260
Friends, family...

20:21.511 --> 20:23.554
...we are gathered to celebrate...

20:23.722 --> 20:26.766
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.936
May the happiness of today...

20:30.103 --> 20:31.437
...be with them always.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.814
Now, Emily, repeat after me.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.484
- I, Emily.
- I, Emily.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.945
- Take thee, Ross.
- Take thee, Ross.

20:39.112 --> 20:42.114
As my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

20:42.282 --> 20:44.408
...till death parts us.

20:44.576 --> 20:48.579
As my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

20:48.747 --> 20:50.790
...until death parts us.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.500
Now, Ross.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.670
Repeat after me.

20:55.837 --> 20:58.839
I, Ross.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.508
Take thee, Emily.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.426
Take thee, Rachel...

21:06.390 --> 21:07.974
Emily!

21:13.313 --> 21:15.773
Ha. Emily.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.696
Uh...

21:22.614 --> 21:24.573
Shall I go on?
