(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.309 --> 00:11.712
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.714
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:13.747 --> 00:15.716
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:15.749 --> 00:17.551
are members
of an elite squad

00:17.585 --> 00:19.720
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.156
These are their stories.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.525
Hey, guys.
Hi.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.427
You excited
about the new playground?

00:26.460 --> 00:27.428
Yes!

00:27.461 --> 00:28.596
It's gonna be really fun.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.831
What happened
to the duckies?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.833
Huh?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.435
Baby ducks live here.
Where'd they go?

00:34.468 --> 00:35.736
(man)
Hey, look at this.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.472
Teeth.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.211
Go back to your mom.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.845
Come on.
Stop the work!

00:44.878 --> 00:46.747
Guys, come here.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.051
I think it's human.

00:54.488 --> 00:55.756
Sorry to add to your
case load, detectives,

00:55.789 --> 00:57.691
but this one
belongs to you.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.692
How can you tell?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.294
Vic's a kid.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.762
Still had a couple
of baby teeth left.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.098
You have those till
age 12 or 13.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.133
You find any more bones?

01:05.166 --> 01:08.169
Just eight teeth
and the mandible.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.538
Sand's from a quarry
in Rockland County.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.574
Melinda!
Check this out.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.647
Battlestar Galactica?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.182
Answers one question.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.484
Death probably occurred
in the late '70s.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.386
I think I had
that lunch box.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.157
Okay, I always wanted
to know this.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.324
What?

01:30.358 --> 01:31.659
Do Twinkies last forever?

01:31.692 --> 01:32.760
Give you 20 bucks,
take a bite.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.162
Bottom line,
we have no indication

01:34.195 --> 01:35.529
this is a homicide,
true?

01:35.563 --> 01:37.698
Correct.
The kid could have fallen in.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.268
Uh, detectives...
it is a homicide.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.869
(Fin)
How you know?

01:44.338 --> 01:46.740
That's a bullet hole.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.860
(Warner)
They got you
back to work already.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.662
Only 30-year-old cases.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.531
How's the dig?

02:43.564 --> 02:44.632
Not bad.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.600
This quarry's been closed
since '76.

02:46.634 --> 02:47.835
Just opened a year ago.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.703
Narrowed our search area.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.505
Got about half of them
so far.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.840
Definitely a boy?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.708
Found his pelvis.

02:54.742 --> 02:58.312
Unfortunately, that's about all
the remains are gonna tell us.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.747
No heel breaks,

02:59.780 --> 03:02.750
no defects or abnormalities
that might help us ID him.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.852
Any hair and tissue
are long gone.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.787
Didn't find
any clothing remnants.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.656
Wouldn't have disintegrated.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.857
Clothes were either dragged
off by animals,

03:09.890 --> 03:10.991
or he wasn't
wearing any.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.694
Detectives...

03:13.727 --> 03:16.264
This might be something.

03:20.668 --> 03:24.605
The print's almost
completely faded off here.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.973
"But he felt oppressed

03:26.006 --> 03:28.642
by a vague sense
of impending calamity."

03:28.676 --> 03:31.312
As do I.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.746
Take a look at these.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.483
Now we're talking.

03:35.516 --> 03:39.753
Molitor, Trammell rookie cards.
These are worth some money.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.754
They're in
amazing condition.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.556
This held up
pretty well too.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.791
All these little pieces
of his life.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.294
They should be able to tell us
something about who he was.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.631
"Go Dragons."

03:50.664 --> 03:52.833
Pretty good artist.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.803
Maybe he played
for the Dragons.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.505
Could they
be a sports team?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.641
Or a mascot.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.042
Take a look at the number.
148.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.744
School 148.

04:03.777 --> 04:04.945
[school bell ringing]

04:04.978 --> 04:06.714
(woman)
From that long ago?

04:06.747 --> 04:09.317
Could be the desaparicion.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.618
Well, who disappeared?

04:10.651 --> 04:12.653
Four boys,
back in 1978.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.788
Four boys went missing
from this school?

04:14.822 --> 04:16.657
Never heard from again?

04:16.690 --> 04:19.327
They were around my age,
12 or 13.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.861
I remember it was early
in the school year

04:20.894 --> 04:22.930
because it was still
light in the evenings.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.565
They played baseball
after dinner.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.667
That was the last time
anybody saw them.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.735
Do you remember
their names?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.002
I'll never forget.

04:29.036 --> 04:32.306
Juan Alvarez.
Hector Padilla.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.742
Esteban Morales.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.843
And Michael Rodriguez.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.078
Back then, this neighborhood
was in the three-seven.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.348
That precinct's been closed
for 20 years.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.716
Meaning the files would be
in a warehouse in Queens.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.385
Assuming they can
dig them up.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.853
You know, in '78,
all the New York papers

04:45.886 --> 04:47.421
were on strike
in the fall.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.657
That's probably the reason
we never heard of this.

04:49.690 --> 04:50.758
Probably wouldn't have anyway.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.560
To most people, they were
just four Puerto Rican thugs

04:52.593 --> 04:54.061
who ran away.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.896
What do you think
happened to them?

04:55.929 --> 04:58.599
When I was a little girl,
my mother said it was a monster

04:58.632 --> 05:01.735
who takes little boys that
don't listen to their parents.

05:01.769 --> 05:05.072
For an unknown case,
it's sure popular.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.874
Files aren't in
the warehouse anymore.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.942
Somebody checked them out.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.311
Who?

05:12.613 --> 05:13.847
Hey, Millie--
Don't even bug me.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.383
Whatever test results
you're looking for,

05:15.416 --> 05:16.917
I don't have them.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.920
How about case files
on four missing boys

05:19.953 --> 05:21.689
from 1978?

05:21.722 --> 05:24.124
Archives says
you checked them out.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.759
Why do you want them?

05:25.793 --> 05:27.428
We found remains.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.662
Where?

05:28.696 --> 05:30.364
Why'd you take the files?

05:30.398 --> 05:31.365
I was looking
for something.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.199
So am I, files.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.868
Fine. Tomorrow,
I'll send them to you.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.103
No, I need them now.
Today.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.104
They're not here.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.973
Where are they?

05:40.007 --> 05:42.676
Look, I just don't want you
to think I'm weird.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.579
Too late.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.050
(Millie)
So I pulled a few cases.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.421
A few?

05:53.454 --> 05:55.423
50 or 60.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.658
Any unsolved murder
or missing persons case

05:57.691 --> 06:01.061
where the victim was
a Hispanic boy, ages 7 to 14.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.631
Committed between
1960 to 1980.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.866
Dad was a cop.
Yeah.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.935
He was a fingerprint analyst
back in the day.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.103
Before computers.

06:10.137 --> 06:13.741
But this...
this is the case

06:13.774 --> 06:15.108
that got him.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.910
April of 1970,

06:16.944 --> 06:18.912
a man walking his dog
near a vacant lot

06:18.946 --> 06:19.980
calls the cops.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.715
Says he sees
a hand sticking out

06:21.749 --> 06:23.751
of an empty
water heater box.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.085
Thought it was
a doll at first.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.487
But it wasn't.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.489
No.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.457
He was never identified.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.593
The papers called him
the Boy in the Box.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.761
He'd been dead
three to four days.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.596
Moved at least twice
post-mortem.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.798
M.E. put him
around nine years old.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.800
But the cause of death
was never determined.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.901
Any suspects?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.169
None.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.905
A witness said they saw
a man and a teenage boy

06:44.938 --> 06:46.440
standing over an open trunk
of a car nearby.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.576
But it didn't lead anywhere.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.978
Pretty soon,
everyone forgot about him.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.446
Not your dad.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.747
Oh, no.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.015
He worked on it
almost every night.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.183
Every weekend.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.918
It was a bottom drawer case.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.921
One you can't let go.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.956
He memorized these.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.958
Kept checking
birth records,

07:04.992 --> 07:07.461
just trying to find
an I.D.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.062
Worked on it till the day
he died this past summer.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.032
Now it's your turn.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.867
[scoffs]
No.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.035
Not like him.

07:15.068 --> 07:18.005
Not give my whole life
to it.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.040
But I would like
to give him a name.

07:22.943 --> 07:27.080
Here. I think this is the case
you were looking for.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.882
1978.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.490
You think if it was
four white boys missing,

07:36.524 --> 07:38.692
the case would still be open?

07:39.993 --> 07:42.663
Probably not.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.532
But at least now
we have remains.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.764
(woman)
That's my son's.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.299
That's Juan's.

08:19.332 --> 08:23.537
I'm sorry, ma'am.
You can't touch that.

08:28.108 --> 08:31.111
[woman sobbing]

08:40.788 --> 08:42.623
(man)
I told them.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.024
I told the police.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.060
Juan would not run away.

08:47.094 --> 08:50.230
He wasn't that kind of boy.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.832
They didn't believe me.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.801
(Stabler)
We're very sorry,
Mr. Alvarez.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.036
And where are those men now?

08:56.069 --> 08:59.740
I want to tell them
myself.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.775
Well, the detectives
that handled your case

09:01.809 --> 09:03.811
passed away
a long time ago.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.215
Do you have any idea who might
have done this to your son?

09:11.719 --> 09:15.889
We always suspected...
Robert Sawyer.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.991
(Mr. Padilla)
He was a handyman
in the neighborhood.

09:18.025 --> 09:22.329
Sometimes he'd hire the boys
for odd jobs.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.898
(Stabler)
Do you think he did this?

09:24.932 --> 09:28.802
(Mrs. Morales)
He was always nice to Esteban.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.037
That's what they do.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.805
That's how they get
the kids to trust them.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.975
The cops let him off
way too easy.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.043
They gave him
a polygraph test,

09:36.076 --> 09:37.945
and he wasn't lying.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.280
People can fool those.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.215
They do it all the time,
right?

09:42.249 --> 09:46.319
Their scientific accuracy
hasn't been totally proven.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.822
(Mrs. Padilla)
I have a question.

09:48.856 --> 09:51.892
Where is my son?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.393
(Mrs. Padilla)
Is he dead?

09:53.426 --> 09:57.197
(Stabler)
We can't say for sure,
Mrs. Padilla.

09:57.230 --> 10:00.968
(Mrs. Padilla)
But he probably is dead,
isn't he?

10:01.001 --> 10:04.204
(Stabler)
After all this time,

10:04.237 --> 10:08.208
it's likely your sons died
when Juan Alvarez did.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.244
But you can't find them.

10:11.278 --> 10:15.048
That means there's
still a possibility.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.917
I don't think so.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.887
Your boys would have tried
to contact you.

10:19.920 --> 10:24.091
Mrs. Morales,
I'm sorry.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.859
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

10:25.893 --> 10:29.997
Hope is all we've got,
Detective Stabler.

10:30.030 --> 10:34.301
(Mrs. Alvarez)
It's supposed to be
better to know.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.137
To not think every
phone call might be him.

10:37.170 --> 10:42.375
To not look at crowds and wonder
if Juan could be in there.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.746
But I think I'll miss it.

10:45.779 --> 10:49.883
I'll miss the hope.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.886
(Stabler)
Mrs. Alvarez said
the handyman, Robert Sawyer,

10:52.920 --> 10:53.987
was seen on the street
with Hector Padilla

10:54.021 --> 10:56.056
and Michael Rodriguez
the night they disappeared.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.958
But he was interviewed
seven times.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.427
He passed the poly,
and he had an alibi.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.762
Yeah.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.797
One of his employees.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.966
Carlos Guzman.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.036
(Munch)
Employees aren't exactly
unimpeachable alibis.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.972
Their livelihood depends
on their boss not going to jail.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.007
They still cleared him.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.276
We only found one body
in the quarry.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.712
What if those three other boys
killed Juan Alvarez

11:18.746 --> 11:20.280
or were somehow
responsible for his death?

11:20.313 --> 11:23.083
They got scared and ran off.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.251
27 years without a peep?

11:24.284 --> 11:25.986
It's unlikely.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.423
Hey, Millie, what kind
of box was your boy found in?

11:30.457 --> 11:32.793
Water heater.
Why?

11:32.826 --> 11:37.030
Sawyer listed as his
primary occupation "plumber."

11:37.064 --> 11:37.931
(Munch)
Interesting coincidence.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.767
You've gotta go
back over the evidence

11:39.800 --> 11:41.034
of your Boy in the Box.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.403
Oh, I've looked
at that stuff 1,000 times.

11:43.436 --> 11:43.971
My dad, a million.

11:44.004 --> 11:44.772
You never had a suspect.

11:44.805 --> 11:50.077
Or another crime
to compare it to.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.079
What's the story
with the blanket?

11:52.112 --> 11:53.947
It was found near the body.

11:53.981 --> 11:57.017
It's actually half a blanket,
cut with scissors.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.019
That detail was kept
out of the papers, though,

11:59.052 --> 12:00.420
in case the other half
was found.

12:00.453 --> 12:05.158
This...this was really
all we had to go with.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.894
See those marks?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.261
Those marks
indicate the box

12:08.295 --> 12:10.163
was dragged part of the way
through the lot.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.532
This kind of water heater
was pretty common.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.502
Several hundred sold
within city limits.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.404
We were actually
able to track down

12:17.437 --> 12:19.039
about 75% of the buyers,
though.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.174
Even the ones
who paid cash.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.811
You keep saying "we."

12:23.844 --> 12:26.113
"We tracked down
the buyers."

12:26.146 --> 12:26.914
Sorry.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.348
Don't be.
You grew up with the case.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.484
This kid must be like
your long-lost brother.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.357
Check this out.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.429
What is that?

12:46.233 --> 12:48.368
Sand.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.371
What if the first place
Sawyer tried to dump the body

12:51.404 --> 12:53.173
was in the sand quarry?

12:53.206 --> 12:54.407
Why not just
leave it there?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.976
Maybe he thought it was
too dangerous?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.378
Place was in operation
in 1970.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.579
You can test it, right?

12:59.612 --> 13:00.914
See if it's the same
kind of sand.

13:00.948 --> 13:01.982
Sawyer had an alibi.

13:02.015 --> 13:05.485
Carlos Guzman.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.354
You know, that's the good thing
about old cases.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.522
Time can change
an alibi's mind.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.892
Test the sand.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.098
(Stabler)
Carlos Guzman!

13:18.131 --> 13:20.467
Who are you?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.135
Detective Stabler.
You got a minute?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.072
What do you want?

13:25.105 --> 13:27.240
I want to talk about
Robert Sawyer.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.345
I don't know where he is.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.514
You knew 30 years ago.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.084
Real good of you
to help a guy out like that.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.286
His alibi.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.557
I just told the truth.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.526
Who says you're lying?

13:46.559 --> 13:49.162
I answered your questions, okay?
I'm busy.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.998
You're doing real well
for yourself, I see.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.533
Pool boy.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.635
Kind of like plumbing,
isn't it?

13:55.668 --> 13:59.873
I own my own business.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.074
And you're looking
pretty ragged there, Carlos.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.109
Like someone
who's been carrying around

14:02.142 --> 14:03.143
a lot of guilt
for a long time.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.912
Now listen to me...

14:04.945 --> 14:08.115
you're not in trouble.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.583
You were young and scared.

14:10.617 --> 14:14.121
But I need to know
where Sawyer is right now.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.889
I do not know.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.891
Okay?

14:19.692 --> 14:22.129
Hey, we found
one of the boys.

14:22.162 --> 14:26.566
It's only a matter of time
till we find the rest.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.570
You can make this right.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.610
The sand from
the evidence bag

14:37.644 --> 14:39.612
and the sand from the quarry
are the same.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.949
C-33 Concrete Sand.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.951
However, it's pretty common.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.285
It's found in playgrounds

14:45.318 --> 14:47.054
and golf courses
all over the place.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.621
Which means whoever killed
Juan Alvarez

14:48.655 --> 14:50.623
probably killed
the Boy in the Box.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.692
But that's not holding up
in court.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.127
But it's enough for me.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.628
We're both looking
for the same guy.

14:55.662 --> 14:56.629
Yeah, but I don't think

14:56.663 --> 14:57.664
Carlos Guzman's changing
his story

14:57.697 --> 15:00.433
any time soon, so
Robert Sawyer's still out there

15:00.467 --> 15:03.136
free and clear unless you and I
make some kind of connection.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.672
Last known address
was Spanish Harlem.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.508
Same neighborhood
as all four boys.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.278
No idea where he lived
from '68 till '77.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.679
He had a P.O. box.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.547
I still think there are
too many similarities

15:14.581 --> 15:16.116
for this to be a coincidence.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.585
No parents, so siblings,
or spouses,

15:18.618 --> 15:20.087
and no activity on his social

15:20.120 --> 15:21.454
since he went underground
in '80.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.190
Plumber, handyman.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.692
That can be a cash-only game.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.128
[cell phone ringing]
No tax records.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.930
Stabler. Yeah?

15:34.034 --> 15:37.937
Yeah, we're on it.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.209
Munch got a call
from a psychiatrist

15:42.242 --> 15:45.678
who claims one of her patients
reported a murder.

15:45.712 --> 15:49.282
From 1970.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.986
A boy whose body was stuffed
in a cardboard box.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.658
(woman)
I haven't seen Anna in years.

15:58.691 --> 16:02.095
Not since she checked herself
out of a psychiatric facility

16:02.129 --> 16:03.997
and vanished.

16:04.031 --> 16:07.000
Out of the blue,
she calls me up this afternoon.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.702
She won't say where she is,
she won't come in.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.738
What time'd she call?
2:30.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.174
She use this line?
Yeah.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.010
Should be able to find her.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.545
What exactly
did she say, Dr. Singh?

16:18.578 --> 16:21.048
It was difficult to follow,
but in a nutshell,

16:21.081 --> 16:23.016
she says that when she was 12,

16:23.050 --> 16:24.617
her father murdered her brother

16:24.651 --> 16:27.254
and forced her to help him
dispose of the body.

16:27.287 --> 16:30.057
They put the boy
in a cardboard box,

16:30.090 --> 16:32.759
threw the box in the trunk
of the father's car.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.028
And then left it
in an empty lot.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.731
This doesn't make any sense.
Why is she reporting this now?

16:38.765 --> 16:40.733
She says she had a dream
and suddenly remembered.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.636
She must've known
we were investigating.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.505
Was this case released
to the media?

16:45.538 --> 16:46.706
Absolutely not.

16:46.739 --> 16:50.310
I didn't want Sawyer to know
that we were looking for him.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.045
Do you believe
your patient's story?

16:52.079 --> 16:54.714
Anna's a disturbed woman.

16:54.747 --> 16:58.085
Years of drug use have
severely damaged her brain.

16:58.118 --> 17:02.155
But she was never prone
to vivid hallucinations.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.791
Got it, pay phone at a park
in the Village.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.826
She used to score ecstasy

17:06.859 --> 17:08.061
in that neighborhood.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.529
She must be using again.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.264
I think she's gonna be
disappointed.

17:11.298 --> 17:14.101
That park was cleaned up
years ago.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.802
How could it be her brother?

17:15.835 --> 17:17.003
One obvious problem
with her story

17:17.036 --> 17:19.706
is that she's white and
the Boy in the Box is Hispanic.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.141
Could've been adopted.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.610
Or a foster kid.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.078
It's been a while.

17:25.112 --> 17:28.215
Maybe she realized
there's no drugs and bailed.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.818
That her?

17:38.625 --> 17:41.261
Oh, yeah.
What's left of her.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.268
Anna Gable?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.272
Dr. Singh sent us.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.344
Are you okay?

18:02.782 --> 18:05.685
Why don't you come with us?

18:08.221 --> 18:11.558
You look like my brother.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.143
Anna, what's your last name?

18:33.946 --> 18:37.116
Do you know who
the president is?

18:42.755 --> 18:46.226
Do you know what year it is?

18:48.861 --> 18:55.435
It's okay, Anna, you don't have
to know the answers right now.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.137
Do you remember talking
to Dr. Singh?

19:01.241 --> 19:02.742
Anna.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.812
Tell me about your brother.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.716
Mmmm.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.851
N--I don't have a brother.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.085
You don't?

19:13.119 --> 19:16.789
But you told Dr. Singh that
your brother had been killed.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.925
Remember?

19:23.463 --> 19:25.698
Oh--okay.

19:25.732 --> 19:29.436
Anna, what happened
to your brother?

19:29.469 --> 19:32.705
The Boy in the Box.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.345
Oh...

19:40.747 --> 19:44.217
I--they stole him...

19:45.818 --> 19:47.687
From where?

19:49.856 --> 19:51.924
Mmmm.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.229
Uh...

19:56.263 --> 19:59.466
A--a--a hospital.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.669
A hospital.
Can you tell me--Anna?

20:07.607 --> 20:09.942
2005.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.712
What?

20:12.745 --> 20:14.881
The year.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.892
Is she high?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.760
I don't think so.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.663
Long-term MDMA users often have
memory impairment

20:30.697 --> 20:32.932
and a decreased attention span.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.735
It's really hard work for her to
maintain a simple conversation.

20:35.768 --> 20:36.869
Okay, so if her memory's
impaired,

20:36.903 --> 20:39.539
do we believe her brother was
stolen from a hospital

20:39.572 --> 20:40.640
and then murdered?

20:40.673 --> 20:42.475
Makes it really questionable.

20:42.509 --> 20:45.278
I don't know if she's actually
had this experience,

20:45.312 --> 20:47.314
or whether she's taking
a well-publicized case

20:47.347 --> 20:48.848
from her childhood,
the Boy in the Box,

20:48.881 --> 20:50.917
and incorporating it
into her memory.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.419
I don't think
she invented this.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.421
The details are too close.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.956
A witness said they saw
a man and a teenage boy

20:56.989 --> 20:59.892
standing over a trunk of a car
near where the body was dumped.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.595
That could very easily have been
Anna and her father.

21:02.629 --> 21:06.633
Except by that time,
Anna's father was already dead.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.402
Anna's dad died in 1961,

21:09.436 --> 21:11.804
nine years before the Boy
in the Box was murdered,

21:11.838 --> 21:13.940
in 1970.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.676
1977, Anna's mother died.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.979
She left the farmhouse
in Rockland County to Anna.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.415
Rockland County. Where
the quarry just happens to be.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.850
(Munch)
Along with
a lovely shopping mall

21:23.883 --> 21:25.318
and the bar where
the Lindbergh baby

21:25.352 --> 21:26.753
kidnapping plot was hatched.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.087
It doesn't mean they're
related to this case.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.656
(Stabler)
Look, Millie, the facts are,

21:29.689 --> 21:30.823
her father was dead.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.792
He couldn't have killed
any of these boys.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.961
Plus, she's got a history
of drug arrests and psych holds.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.729
That doesn't mean anything.

21:36.763 --> 21:37.930
(Fin)
It means she's unreliable,
Millie.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.999
You're wasting your time.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.468
Look, York Hospital was involved

21:41.501 --> 21:43.102
in a black market baby scandal
in 1962.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.972
That's just 30 miles away
from where Anna grew up.

21:46.005 --> 21:50.843
And one of the babies stolen
was a Hispanic boy.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.579
Let's go.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.017
(woman)
The kidnappings
were before my time.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.752
They caught the nurse
responsible,

21:59.786 --> 22:01.120
but weren't able to track down
all the babies,

22:01.153 --> 22:02.422
including this boy.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.490
If the birth parents
are still alive,

22:03.523 --> 22:05.725
you could test 'em against
your little guy's DNA.

22:09.396 --> 22:11.831
Doesn't matter,
it's not him.

22:11.864 --> 22:12.965
How do you know?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.567
I just know. It's not him.

22:14.601 --> 22:15.802
Well, I guess that's a relief

22:15.835 --> 22:16.536
in a way.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.405
I remember that Boy in the Box.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.472
Hate to think he was taken
from here.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.508
You memorized his prints too.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.843
I need all birth records
from '60 to '65.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.512
Why?

22:25.545 --> 22:27.714
How many babies do you think
were stolen from this hospital?

22:27.747 --> 22:29.682
Doesn't matter.
Do you have them?

22:29.716 --> 22:30.683
In the basement somewhere.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.820
You'd have to look
through them yourself.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.689
Now, look, this is nuts.

22:36.723 --> 22:39.426
Anna probably incorporated
this baby scandal

22:39.459 --> 22:40.593
into her fantasies,

22:40.627 --> 22:42.094
just like she incorporated
that boy.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.396
Why now?

22:43.430 --> 22:44.397
Why does Anna suddenly remember

22:44.431 --> 22:46.633
the Boy in the Box case
at the exact same time

22:46.666 --> 22:47.700
that you're investigating it?

22:47.734 --> 22:48.668
Her dad didn't kill anyone.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.137
Her brother was not stolen
from this hospital.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.772
Now, I'm not gonna
spin my wheels

22:52.805 --> 22:56.075
on some woman who's fried
every synapse in her head.

22:56.108 --> 22:57.644
She was raised
not 20 minutes away

22:57.677 --> 22:59.178
from where Juan Alvarez's
body was found.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.880
She doesn't know anything
about that.

23:00.913 --> 23:03.683
Is that the boy who's been
missing since the '70s?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.988
I read it in the newspaper.

23:09.021 --> 23:11.791
That's not possible.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.561
No, I remember.
It was a few days ago.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.031
Here. Here it is.

23:22.001 --> 23:26.138
[sighs]
I'll be damned.

23:26.172 --> 23:30.477
Maybe it triggered her memory.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.812
(Huang)
Anna.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.113
Do you remember us?

23:34.146 --> 23:36.849
We spoke at the police station.

23:36.883 --> 23:39.719
Detective Stabler found you
in the park.

23:44.657 --> 23:47.860
Hey, Anna?

23:47.894 --> 23:51.598
Help me out here.
Do you recognize this blanket?

23:54.834 --> 23:57.670
It's been cut in half,
and it was found...

23:57.704 --> 23:59.572
with this boy here.

24:02.141 --> 24:05.177
Now, you know him.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.614
Who is he?

24:10.950 --> 24:14.086
You saw Juan Alvarez's picture
in the newspaper.

24:14.120 --> 24:18.257
And it helped you remember.

24:18.290 --> 24:22.829
Helped you remember Hector.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.097
Michael.

24:25.131 --> 24:28.267
Esteban.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.102
Anna, what happened to them?

24:30.136 --> 24:32.805
What happened to them?

24:34.541 --> 24:36.943
I--I don't know.

24:36.976 --> 24:40.913
You said this boy
was your brother.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.582
Who is he?
Who killed him?

24:42.615 --> 24:43.950
Who killed him, Anna?
No...

24:43.983 --> 24:46.285
No brother.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.954
Anna, listen to me--

24:47.987 --> 24:49.922
(Huang)
Eliot.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.968
I don't know, Anna.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.839
Maybe the only part
of your brain you've got left

25:06.873 --> 25:08.274
just remembers the little
details about crimes

25:08.307 --> 25:10.910
and pretends
that you were part of them.

25:12.912 --> 25:16.616
He burned it.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.320
That...

25:21.353 --> 25:24.824
with a cigarette.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.861
He cut off the burned part.

25:28.895 --> 25:33.600
It was a pretty blanket.

25:33.633 --> 25:36.869
Who burned it, Anna?

25:45.311 --> 25:47.914
Is this the man?

25:49.348 --> 25:51.317
Was it him?

25:55.788 --> 25:57.089
Dad.

25:57.123 --> 26:00.860
(Huang)
No, Anna.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.996
Your father passed away
when you were very young.

26:06.966 --> 26:10.336
He lived at my house.

26:10.369 --> 26:13.139
When I was away.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.177
Maybe Sawyer was Mom's
live-in boyfriend.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.046
And then stayed there
after Mom died.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.950
These boys were killed in '78.
Where was Anna at that time?

26:23.983 --> 26:26.152
Committed to the state hospital
the entire year.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.788
Leaving Sawyer alone
in Anna's farmhouse

26:28.821 --> 26:31.691
in the middle of nowhere.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.861
It's a perfect spot
to kill four boys.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.944
Go around back.

26:58.718 --> 27:02.188
Doesn't look like anyone's lived
here since Anna's mother died.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.924
No basement
in a house like this.

27:04.957 --> 27:08.728
There's probably a crawl space
underneath, though.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.263
Could've ripped up
the floorboards.

27:13.199 --> 27:18.070
Unless he didn't want
to exert the effort.

27:18.104 --> 27:22.174
It's private.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.346
Plenty of places
to hide bodies.

27:27.379 --> 27:30.082
This is gonna take a while.

27:44.997 --> 27:48.667
Looks like a trash bag.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.092
At least we can prove
four little boys

28:13.125 --> 28:15.962
didn't just vanish
into thin air.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.332
Only took 30 years to do it.

28:34.513 --> 28:37.383
(Vizcarrondo)
Picture's not gonna
tell you anything.

28:37.416 --> 28:41.487
You can stare at it every day
for the rest of your life.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.189
And they're still just pictures
of dead kids.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.523
I just thought
once we found them,

28:44.556 --> 28:48.427
everything would fall
into place.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.962
Who is he?

28:49.996 --> 28:51.831
How'd Sawyer get him?

28:51.864 --> 28:54.000
What, he steal him as a baby
and raise him?

28:54.033 --> 28:56.068
Or did he kidnap him?

28:56.102 --> 28:57.103
Was the boy the child

28:57.136 --> 28:58.971
of undocumented immigrants

28:59.005 --> 29:01.107
that were too afraid to report
his disappearance?

29:01.140 --> 29:06.378
Maybe he worked for Sawyer
like the rest of the boys.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.215
Why dump one boy in a box?

29:09.248 --> 29:10.850
And another at a quarry,

29:10.883 --> 29:12.251
then bury the rest
under his shed?

29:12.284 --> 29:14.821
Why do you start to dump
the Boy in the Box at the quarry

29:14.854 --> 29:16.823
then take him all the way
to Brooklyn

29:16.856 --> 29:19.325
to finish the job, why?

29:20.592 --> 29:22.862
He knew
about the vacant lot.

29:22.895 --> 29:26.165
What if someone scared him
away from the quarry?

29:26.198 --> 29:28.500
Okay, but eight years later,
he returns

29:28.534 --> 29:31.938
to the same quarry to dump
Juan, but not the others.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.040
Why?

29:35.107 --> 29:39.812
How do you control
four adolescent boys?

29:39.846 --> 29:41.981
You scare 'em.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.951
You kill one,
and the others fall into line.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.452
You have an accomplice.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.220
Someone to help you
wrangle them.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.956
Like with the Boy in the Box.
Mm-hmm.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.591
The witness saw the teenager
by the trunk of the car.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.493
One of Sawyer's employees.

29:54.526 --> 29:57.096
(Stabler)
Carlos.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.001
Why do we have to
go back through this?

30:02.034 --> 30:03.970
Why? Because all
of these kids are dead.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.104
They were all murdered

30:05.137 --> 30:07.907
and then dumped like garbage.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.308
You don't want
to talk about it?

30:09.341 --> 30:10.843
It's too upsetting for you?

30:10.877 --> 30:12.011
(Stabler)
Maybe he doesn't want to talk

30:12.044 --> 30:15.181
about it because Sawyer
didn't kill him.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.415
Carlos did.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.250
No, I didn't kill anybody.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.919
Sawyer was cleared by the cops
years ago.

30:19.952 --> 30:20.953
Who am I to argue?

30:20.987 --> 30:21.954
You know that's not true.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.991
Well, you alibied him,
Carlos.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.026
Are you telling me you lied?

30:27.059 --> 30:29.028
I didn't do anything.

30:29.061 --> 30:32.865
Didn't do anything?
Yeah. Right.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.200
You did nothing.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.602
30 years went by, and
this little boy has no name

30:36.635 --> 30:39.471
and four families had to
go through life not knowing

30:39.505 --> 30:40.973
if their little boys
were dead or alive.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.909
Why?

30:42.942 --> 30:46.178
Because you did nothing.

30:46.212 --> 30:49.181
[sobbing]

30:49.215 --> 30:51.984
He said he'd kill Anna.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.055
Anna Gable?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.392
How do you know her?

31:05.064 --> 31:07.934
I loved her.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.235
She was really messed up,

31:09.268 --> 31:12.271
but I loved her.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.175
I was visiting my grandma
in Brooklyn,

31:16.208 --> 31:18.344
and he came by and he said
I had to help him.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.513
And I was about 14.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.149
There's this kid in the trunk.

31:23.182 --> 31:26.018
In a box,
this dead kid.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.619
So we're riding around,

31:27.653 --> 31:29.221
and I'm freaking out.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.657
He has to pull over
because I have to throw up.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.693
And he's screaming at me,
he's hitting me.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.996
And he makes me take this box

31:37.029 --> 31:40.099
and leave it, and he says...

31:40.132 --> 31:45.504
[sobbing]
if I tell anyone,
he would kill Anna.

31:45.537 --> 31:49.708
I'm sorry.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.244
Okay, now tell me
about these boys.

31:52.278 --> 31:55.047
What about these other boys?

32:02.488 --> 32:04.256
I knew 'em.

32:09.228 --> 32:11.463
But now I'm gonna tell you
the worst part.

32:11.497 --> 32:14.400
I'm gonna tell you why

32:14.433 --> 32:17.269
I deserve everything I get.

32:17.303 --> 32:20.572
Anna and I stayed in contact

32:20.606 --> 32:21.640
even after she ran away,

32:21.673 --> 32:26.678
even after they locked her up
in that nuthouse.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.481
When Rob killed these boys,
I called Anna

32:29.515 --> 32:31.250
and I told her everything.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.684
I told her about
the Boy in the Box,

32:32.718 --> 32:34.020
I told her about
these other boys.

32:34.053 --> 32:38.157
And about how
I was Rob's alibi.

32:41.527 --> 32:45.364
And she said she didn't care.

32:45.397 --> 32:49.268
She said she loved me anyway.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.237
But why is that
the worst part, Carlos?

32:51.270 --> 32:53.739
Because it's my fault!

32:53.772 --> 32:57.209
Rob found out I told Anna,
he killed her!

32:58.577 --> 33:01.013
Carlos, Anna's alive.

33:01.047 --> 33:04.016
But Rob--

33:04.050 --> 33:07.553
Rob said he killed her.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.322
He said if I said anything,
he would do me too.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.124
That's what I believed.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.060
All these years,
that's what I believed,

33:14.093 --> 33:18.030
and now you tell me
that's not true?

33:32.144 --> 33:34.313
Anna.

33:37.216 --> 33:38.784
Anna, do you know me?

33:46.292 --> 33:49.261
He did this to her.

33:49.295 --> 33:53.232
Rob would go on jobs
in people's houses.

33:53.265 --> 33:57.336
And raid their
medicine cabinets.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.471
And he made Anna take
whatever he could find.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.240
He thought it was funny.

34:01.273 --> 34:04.510
And it made it easier...

34:06.212 --> 34:08.514
to do things to her.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.251
Carlos, if you know
where Sawyer is,

34:12.284 --> 34:13.552
I promise you,
we'll make him pay.

34:13.585 --> 34:14.553
I don't.

34:14.586 --> 34:15.554
I spent most of my life

34:15.587 --> 34:18.590
hiding from him.

34:21.593 --> 34:24.563
It's...not Sawyer.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.265
It's him, Anna.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.634
We don't have to
protect him anymore.

34:35.241 --> 34:38.877
His name isn't Sawyer.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.280
He has a real name.

34:42.881 --> 34:45.384
What's his real name, Anna?

34:57.163 --> 35:00.732
He said he killed you.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.308
(Vizcarrondo)
Robert Sawyer.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.610
Prints have been
in the system since 1964

35:11.643 --> 35:13.345
for fare beating in the subway.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.714
Social Security Administration
has no death record

35:15.747 --> 35:18.750
of Robert Sawyer, but in 1968,

35:18.784 --> 35:22.354
Mr. Sawyer had
a sudden career change.

35:23.755 --> 35:27.393
He went from being an accountant
to a plumber.

35:27.426 --> 35:28.760
Who does that?

35:30.596 --> 35:32.198
No one.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.699
Wait a minute.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.834
What if his identity
was stolen?

35:35.867 --> 35:37.536
We've been thinking
Robert Sawyer

35:37.569 --> 35:38.370
took an alias.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.172
Robert Sawyer is the alias.

35:40.206 --> 35:42.274
No relatives, no marriages.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.242
If he died--

35:43.275 --> 35:44.443
Or was killed.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.278
And no one reported him dead.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.380
That's the perfect identity
to steal.

35:48.414 --> 35:51.250
So the real Robert Sawyer
died in 1968.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.452
That means the 1964 prints
we have in the system

35:53.485 --> 35:54.820
belong to him.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.823
But we've got our guy's.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.828
The man we know as Sawyer
was polygraphed in '78,

36:02.861 --> 36:04.596
but never formally arrested.

36:04.630 --> 36:08.234
So they printed him and never
put him in the system.

36:08.267 --> 36:11.403
Until now.

36:20.812 --> 36:24.650
Sheldon Kerrick! NYPD!
Open the door!

36:24.683 --> 36:26.818
Go ahead.

36:26.985 --> 36:29.488
Police!

36:30.989 --> 36:32.391
Bathroom, clear.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.326
Kitchen, clear.

36:40.466 --> 36:43.469
[Kerrick coughing]

36:56.882 --> 37:00.986
Okay, let's keep this short
if we can.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.854
My client has end-stage
pancreatic cancer.

37:02.888 --> 37:06.224
Good. Hope it hurts.

37:07.293 --> 37:08.126
Mr. Kerrick.

37:08.159 --> 37:10.662
The evidence against you
is overwhelming.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.498
The nature of your acts
is heinous.

37:12.531 --> 37:16.001
A jury will not take pity on you
because of your illness.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.769
You will be found guilty,

37:17.803 --> 37:18.837
and you'll be
sentenced to prison

37:18.870 --> 37:19.871
for the rest of your life.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.807
However short that may be.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.677
That's supposed to scare me?
No.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.679
I'm not trying to scare you.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.681
I'm simply giving you
the lay of the land.

37:29.715 --> 37:33.719
And then I'll offer you
some options.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.655
In consideration
of your medical status,

37:36.688 --> 37:38.557
and that your death
would likely occur

37:38.590 --> 37:39.991
before the conclusion
of a trial.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.027
I'm offering the following:

37:42.060 --> 37:43.695
You will plead guilty

37:43.729 --> 37:45.764
to all charges.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.833
While you are in state custody,

37:47.866 --> 37:49.501
I will personally arrange
for an oncologist

37:49.535 --> 37:50.969
to take care of you.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.004
And when your condition
worsens--and believe me,

37:53.038 --> 37:55.374
your condition will worsen--

37:55.407 --> 37:58.410
I will not oppose
your attorney's request

37:58.444 --> 38:01.447
for compassionate release.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.649
You would die a free man.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.692
In return,

38:13.725 --> 38:16.762
you will tell us
the name of this boy.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.532
And in the event
that you do not know his name,

38:20.566 --> 38:23.769
you will disclose everything
that you do know about him.

38:23.802 --> 38:27.373
And if that information leads
to his identification,

38:27.406 --> 38:28.840
same offer applies.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.445
You jerk me around,

38:33.479 --> 38:34.913
I will make sure
that you are locked up

38:34.946 --> 38:38.750
in the prison ward of a hospital
until the day you die.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.922
I don't remember.

38:43.955 --> 38:46.592
Yes, you do,
you son of a bitch.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.059
You remember every one

38:48.093 --> 38:49.828
of those boys
that you murdered.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.763
You remember every detail

38:51.797 --> 38:53.865
'cause you play it over and over
in your head.

38:53.899 --> 38:57.836
Now, don't you tell me
that you didn't kill him.

38:57.869 --> 39:01.407
Don't tell me
you don't know him.

39:03.775 --> 39:06.645
Answer her question.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.885
Sorry.

39:13.919 --> 39:18.056
I don't remember.

39:40.446 --> 39:43.615
Hey.

39:43.649 --> 39:47.519
My father and a couple of
the other cops paid for this.

39:47.553 --> 39:48.854
It's nice.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.422
Yeah.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.824
Better than a numbered grave,
I guess.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.898
It's stupid.

40:02.033 --> 40:07.673
I used to hate this kid
when I was growing up.

40:10.175 --> 40:14.846
I even thought my father
loved him more than me.

40:19.851 --> 40:23.855
That's why I know
I messed this up.

40:23.889 --> 40:26.492
I jinxed it somehow.

40:29.828 --> 40:33.965
Well, I think someday
we will be able to name him.

40:36.802 --> 40:40.038
I also think you gotta
give yourself a break, Millie.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.976
Your father
made a decision.

40:46.978 --> 40:50.716
He spent his life...

40:50.749 --> 40:52.984
on a dead child.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.153
When he had a living child
at home.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.529
Yeah.

41:06.264 --> 41:06.331
