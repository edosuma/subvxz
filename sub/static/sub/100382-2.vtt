00:00.020 --> 00:01.488
Previously on "Lincoln Rhyme"...

00:01.490 --> 00:03.278
Lincoln, wait for backup.

00:04.860 --> 00:06.426
No, no, no!

00:06.428 --> 00:08.228
Lincoln, can you hear me?

00:08.230 --> 00:13.800
I want you to hear the sound
of being just not smart enough.

00:13.802 --> 00:15.690
I'm ready for another shot at the bastard

00:15.692 --> 00:16.994
who put me in this bed.

00:16.996 --> 00:18.738
Stop!

00:18.740 --> 00:21.241
I'd like Officer Sachs
to be my point person.

00:21.641 --> 00:23.874
You want the experience
of being at a crime scene

00:23.876 --> 00:25.509
without ever leaving your bed?

00:25.511 --> 00:27.378
It's my sister.

00:27.380 --> 00:28.479
Rachel.

00:29.649 --> 00:30.948
They're all right.

00:30.950 --> 00:32.516
They're both all right.

00:34.787 --> 00:37.721
It's him, isn't it? The Bone Collector.

00:37.723 --> 00:38.989
He's still out there.

00:38.991 --> 00:40.558
It'll all be over soon.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.626
There's nothing like the perfect gift

00:42.628 --> 00:44.161
for an old friend.

00:57.410 --> 01:01.579
You're gonna play
a very big part in things.

01:01.581 --> 01:03.935
Oh, yes, you will.

01:32.678 --> 01:34.120
Are you alive in there?

01:48.361 --> 01:49.860
How long have you been knocking?

01:49.862 --> 01:51.303
A while.

01:52.131 --> 01:53.697
Well, aren't you gonna invite me in?

01:53.699 --> 01:55.032
I'm...

01:55.034 --> 01:56.600
running sensitive tests in here.

01:56.602 --> 01:59.370
You might contaminate the findings.

01:59.372 --> 02:03.207
Oh, yeah, busiest
forensic tech in Colorado.

02:03.209 --> 02:04.875
But you still need to eat.

02:04.877 --> 02:06.735
I made you a panini.

02:08.314 --> 02:10.572
With that melted cheese you like.

02:11.317 --> 02:14.585
You're right. I forgot all about eating.

02:14.587 --> 02:16.078
Thank you.

02:18.737 --> 02:21.792
I feel like you've been
shutting me out lately.

02:26.065 --> 02:28.065
No, not at all.

02:28.067 --> 02:32.303
I-I get focused on what I'm doing,

02:32.305 --> 02:35.931
and I lose track of time.

02:36.409 --> 02:38.517
I'm sorry you feel like that.

02:41.914 --> 02:46.350
It is really good to see you
invested in your work again.

02:46.352 --> 02:47.751
It's my life's blood.

02:53.192 --> 02:55.793
Okay. I'm going.

02:55.795 --> 02:57.327
Bye.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.433
Ready for the big reveal?

03:20.219 --> 03:22.052
Behold.

03:22.054 --> 03:25.222
We're gonna be able to process
forensic evidence right here.

03:25.224 --> 03:26.690
And by "we," I mean me.

03:26.692 --> 03:28.959
Thank you, Kate. What about ballistics?

03:28.961 --> 03:31.395
I have a high-speed camera,
but unless your building

03:31.397 --> 03:34.965
is zoned for a firing range,
I think that happens downtown.

03:34.967 --> 03:36.000
Fair enough.

03:36.002 --> 03:37.167
Man, look at that chair.

03:37.169 --> 03:38.969
That is a thing of beauty.

03:38.971 --> 03:40.904
Someone enhanced that
with upgrades, didn't they?

03:40.906 --> 03:42.573
Oh, right. That was me.

03:42.575 --> 03:45.309
More importantly, Felix, the notebooks?

03:45.311 --> 03:47.511
20 years of your notes

03:47.513 --> 03:49.646
cataloguing every infinitesimal
detail of the city,

03:49.648 --> 03:51.882
every forensic observation, every case,

03:51.884 --> 03:55.252
all digitized by 9:00 a.m. tomorrow,

03:55.254 --> 03:56.887
our first official day as a task force.

03:56.889 --> 03:59.490
- Excellent.
- Any idea where we start?

03:59.492 --> 04:00.824
What kind of cases we'll be handling?

04:00.826 --> 04:02.526
The cases the chief and commissioner feel

04:02.528 --> 04:05.662
they can't solve through
typical NYPD channels.

04:05.664 --> 04:07.164
But I've been going through
files on my own.

04:07.166 --> 04:08.832
I have some candidates.

04:08.834 --> 04:11.301
He's been going through files
till all hours.

04:16.509 --> 04:18.617
This is my work, Claire.

04:21.213 --> 04:22.679
And my work is keeping you healthy.

04:22.681 --> 04:24.681
You remember what Dr. Trask said.

04:24.683 --> 04:26.249
My toe.

04:26.685 --> 04:30.254
Two weeks, I can still
control dorsiflexion.

04:30.256 --> 04:32.289
Functionally speaking, unimportant.

04:32.291 --> 04:34.525
An accomplishment nonetheless.

04:34.527 --> 04:35.926
Which is my point.

04:35.928 --> 04:38.629
You diving back into work,
while a good thing,

04:38.631 --> 04:40.564
will add stress,
which will undo your progress.

04:40.566 --> 04:42.433
You don't think going back
to work is a good idea?

04:42.435 --> 04:44.368
I just want you to realize
you have a choice.

04:47.273 --> 04:51.024
Lincoln, we got a case.

04:51.544 --> 04:54.194
Looks like we're starting a day early.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.280
We have our first assignment.

04:57.989 --> 04:59.550
Here's what we know at the moment.

04:59.552 --> 05:03.287
NYPD has a unit that monitors
various dark sites

05:03.289 --> 05:06.390
related to serial killers,
their acolytes.

05:06.392 --> 05:09.093
They found this on a site
on the dark web.

05:09.095 --> 05:12.162
Mankind is not kind.

05:12.164 --> 05:14.565
People are self-involved.

05:14.567 --> 05:17.901
Man's hubris is out of control.

05:17.903 --> 05:22.573
Man's villainy and depravity
can no longer be tolerated.

05:22.575 --> 05:26.510
It is time for The Wrath of the Gods

05:26.512 --> 05:27.444
to make things right.

05:27.446 --> 05:30.013
Wrath of the Gods is the serial killer

05:30.015 --> 05:31.315
who struck in three cities.

05:31.317 --> 05:33.917
Started in Amsterdam in 2008,

05:33.919 --> 05:35.752
then Boston, Chicago.

05:35.754 --> 05:38.622
Each time, the first murder
is followed by a spree,

05:38.624 --> 05:40.691
a series of killings for at least a week.

05:40.693 --> 05:42.960
The killer is telling us
he's in New York.

05:42.962 --> 05:44.428
Yes. Upping the ante.

05:44.430 --> 05:46.797
This time he's streaming live.

05:54.006 --> 05:55.439
- Oh, my God.
- Felix.

05:55.441 --> 05:56.940
Working to track the feed.

05:56.942 --> 05:58.275
It's being passed through servers.

05:58.277 --> 06:00.377
It's pinging all over the
place... Bosnia, Malta.

06:02.448 --> 06:04.515
- I can't watch.
- We have to.

06:04.517 --> 06:06.216
It's how we'll know
where to find the evidence.

06:10.990 --> 06:12.222
Couldn't get a location.

06:12.224 --> 06:13.657
Move past it.

06:13.659 --> 06:15.626
Our job now is to take apart that video.

06:15.628 --> 06:17.628
Find the girl, and we find her killer.

06:17.630 --> 06:18.829
- Kate?
- I'm on the bathroom.

06:18.831 --> 06:20.330
Bathtub, windows.

06:20.332 --> 06:21.398
Felix?

06:21.400 --> 06:23.233
I'll run facial recognition,

06:23.235 --> 06:24.401
break down the ambient noise.

06:24.403 --> 06:25.636
- Eric?
- I'm getting the files

06:25.638 --> 06:26.503
from all the old cases.

06:26.505 --> 06:29.840
- Sellitto?
- Killer's live-streaming for a reason.

06:29.842 --> 06:32.409
He's playing to his acolytes,
building followers.

06:32.411 --> 06:33.977
I'll work that angle.

06:38.551 --> 06:40.675
Welcome to the team, Amelia.

06:41.820 --> 06:43.587
Is every day gonna be like this?

06:43.589 --> 06:46.139
Some days will be worse.

06:46.992 --> 06:49.092
Like the day your sister was taken.

06:49.094 --> 06:51.562
Not sure you're selling this very well.

06:51.564 --> 06:53.564
I won't sugarcoat it.

06:53.566 --> 06:55.832
This can be rough, but I can promise you,

06:55.834 --> 06:59.203
you work with me, you will save people.

06:59.205 --> 07:00.771
And what about you?

07:00.773 --> 07:02.839
Are you really ready
to get back in the game

07:02.841 --> 07:04.950
after everything it's cost you?

07:05.678 --> 07:08.111
I thought losing
the use of my arms and legs

07:08.113 --> 07:10.847
was the worst thing
the Bone Collector did to me.

07:12.952 --> 07:14.459
But it wasn't.

07:16.021 --> 07:18.880
I let him take what I did. Who I am.

07:19.725 --> 07:21.591
I'm getting that back.

07:23.262 --> 07:25.220
I'm not going to walk again,

07:26.699 --> 07:28.932
but I can do this better than anyone.

07:31.203 --> 07:32.434
With your help.

07:35.811 --> 07:37.399
I got a hit.

07:39.078 --> 07:41.311
You got facial recognition that fast?

07:41.313 --> 07:43.046
Victim's all over social media.

07:43.048 --> 07:46.817
Delila Towne, AKA NYC underscore Delila.

07:46.819 --> 07:48.552
Is she some kind of celebrity?

07:48.554 --> 07:50.887
Apparently, she's a wannabe influencer.

07:50.889 --> 07:53.457
Every post is either a selfie
or vanity shot.

07:53.459 --> 07:55.259
Got an address. Queens.

07:55.261 --> 07:56.226
All right, let's hit it.

07:56.228 --> 07:58.378
Amelia, wait.

07:59.298 --> 08:01.431
I upgraded your camera rig.

08:01.433 --> 08:04.234
Smaller, improved audio,

08:04.236 --> 08:06.670
wider aperture, more pixels.

08:06.672 --> 08:08.672
Mute can be your friend.

08:08.674 --> 08:10.841
You can turn it off anytime you want.

08:10.843 --> 08:13.110
Thanks, Felix.

08:13.112 --> 08:14.111
You're a lifesaver.

08:17.349 --> 08:19.524
The killer was making a point.

08:22.321 --> 08:23.862
Vanity.

08:27.660 --> 08:29.092
Let me see the body.

08:32.164 --> 08:33.196
Seen enough?

08:33.198 --> 08:34.998
Show me the flowers.

08:35.467 --> 08:38.635
Some sort of daffodil?

08:40.506 --> 08:41.972
It's narcissus.

08:41.974 --> 08:44.041
Narcissus?

08:44.043 --> 08:46.476
The flower and the girl. Narcissus.

08:46.478 --> 08:48.645
Fell in love with his own image.

08:48.647 --> 08:51.848
Died next to a pool of water
so self-obsessed,

08:51.850 --> 08:54.051
he wouldn't leave his own reflection.

08:54.053 --> 08:56.887
The killer was reenacting
the gods' justice.

08:56.889 --> 08:59.511
Serious profiling opportunity.

09:02.127 --> 09:03.527
Hey.

09:06.298 --> 09:07.822
A feather?

09:08.634 --> 09:09.866
Get it back to Kate.

09:09.868 --> 09:12.803
Delila Towne, 24 years old,

09:12.805 --> 09:15.121
been living here six months.

09:15.574 --> 09:17.474
No security to speak of,

09:17.476 --> 09:19.459
wasn't hard for the killer to get in.

09:20.312 --> 09:22.579
What do you make of that?

09:28.654 --> 09:30.887
Those are mythological figures.

09:31.190 --> 09:33.890
Each panel tells the story of a myth.

09:34.526 --> 09:37.394
A myth in which a mortal
is punished by the gods.

09:38.163 --> 09:40.664
What about the one with the X through it?

09:40.666 --> 09:42.265
Narcissus.

09:42.267 --> 09:44.901
He crossed Narcissus off the list.

09:45.204 --> 09:47.070
Our killer's just getting started.

09:47.072 --> 09:49.840
Which means for each remaining panel,

09:49.842 --> 09:51.708
someone is about to die.

09:54.035 --> 10:01.960
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

10:02.885 --> 10:05.143
A who's who of Greek mythology.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.904
Arachne, Prometheus, Orpheus,

10:07.906 --> 10:10.006
Sisyphus, and Narcissus.

10:10.008 --> 10:11.841
Each incurred the wrath of the gods,

10:11.843 --> 10:13.176
and lost their lives over it.

10:13.589 --> 10:15.578
So Delila,

10:15.580 --> 10:17.847
she was killed for posting selfies,

10:17.849 --> 10:20.183
and that makes her Narcissus?

10:20.185 --> 10:23.820
Narcissistic, self-absorbed.

10:23.822 --> 10:25.922
Our victim is an example, a message.

10:25.924 --> 10:28.758
And the killings that came before,

10:28.760 --> 10:30.760
the killer always left paintings?

10:30.762 --> 10:33.027
He did. The others are being digitized.

10:33.029 --> 10:34.480
They'll be ready within the hour.

10:34.482 --> 10:37.033
Kate is testing the canvas, the frames,

10:37.035 --> 10:38.568
even checking a trace for a cloth

10:38.570 --> 10:41.499
used to cover these paintings
during transport.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.173
We'll catch him, Lincoln.

10:44.175 --> 10:46.876
So how do we figure out who's next?

10:46.878 --> 10:49.746
Who's Orpheus, who's Arachne?

10:49.748 --> 10:51.748
- Follow the evidence.
- Well, right. I mean, I get that.

10:51.750 --> 10:55.017
But we should talk about
who would do this and why.

10:55.019 --> 10:56.471
- Context is everything...
- When the clock is ticking,

10:56.473 --> 10:58.087
the evidence leads to who much faster.

10:58.089 --> 11:00.523
Lincoln, if you want
someone to put on this camera

11:00.525 --> 11:02.976
so you can tell them
to turn right and turn left,

11:02.978 --> 11:05.152
there are others that can do that.

11:05.180 --> 11:06.441
No.

11:06.940 --> 11:07.939
There aren't.

11:07.954 --> 11:10.488
I personally selected you
for this task force.

11:10.490 --> 11:12.991
Then my eyes and ears come with a brain.

11:12.993 --> 11:14.192
You want me, you get both.

11:14.194 --> 11:16.242
I need you on my team.

11:16.630 --> 11:19.662
But understand it is my team.

11:21.087 --> 11:23.249
So someone out there knows something.

11:24.004 --> 11:26.171
We just have to find who it is.

11:26.173 --> 11:28.004
She was my best friend.

11:29.342 --> 11:31.476
Why would someone do this to her?

11:31.478 --> 11:33.645
Well, we are working to figure it out.

11:33.647 --> 11:36.147
Did Delila say anybody was following her

11:36.149 --> 11:37.448
or bothering her?

11:37.450 --> 11:39.984
No, Delila was amazing.

11:39.986 --> 11:41.452
Everyone loved her.

11:41.454 --> 11:43.102
Her social media...

11:44.324 --> 11:46.391
made her seem a little self-involved.

11:46.393 --> 11:48.054
No, not at all.

11:48.054 --> 11:50.054
Her brand was all about positivity.

11:50.056 --> 11:51.889
Loving life, loving herself.

11:51.891 --> 11:53.157
Her brand?

11:53.159 --> 11:55.859
Her content. The stuff she posted.

11:55.861 --> 11:58.409
It was a statement
about self-empowerment.

11:59.331 --> 12:02.288
Here. Check out this shot.

12:05.204 --> 12:06.870
I mean, who doesn't
want to feel like that?

12:06.872 --> 12:08.038
"I feel so good,

12:08.040 --> 12:10.880
I could stare at myself all day."

12:11.944 --> 12:13.842
This photograph was online?

12:14.180 --> 12:16.213
It was her Instagram profile picture.

12:16.215 --> 12:18.282
And how many people saw this?

12:18.284 --> 12:21.385
Delila had 10,000 followers.

12:21.387 --> 12:23.720
But if they repost it,

12:23.722 --> 12:26.187
it could be hundreds of thousands.

12:27.626 --> 12:29.359
Felix, the killer saw the profile photo.

12:29.361 --> 12:30.394
That was how she was chosen.

12:30.396 --> 12:32.262
Got it. Check every follower,

12:32.264 --> 12:33.964
every like,
every comment about her story.

12:33.966 --> 12:35.599
While he's on that,

12:35.601 --> 12:37.935
I tested the feather
Amelia found at the scene.

12:37.937 --> 12:39.937
Belongs to the Great Basin Goose,

12:39.939 --> 12:41.572
from a small, but robust,

12:41.574 --> 12:43.707
breeding population in Eastern Canada.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.776
It migrates from Pennsylvania
to Massachusetts...

12:45.778 --> 12:47.444
Were there prints on the feather?

12:47.446 --> 12:48.245
DNA?

12:48.247 --> 12:50.080
None besides avian genotyping.

12:50.082 --> 12:51.081
It's from a female.

12:51.083 --> 12:52.505
Mother Goose.

12:53.319 --> 12:54.451
- Sorry.
- You should be.

12:54.453 --> 12:55.419
You got the previous case files?

12:55.421 --> 12:59.423
13 killings in Chicago,
Boston, Amsterdam.

12:59.425 --> 13:01.758
Killing sprees of four and five each.

13:01.760 --> 13:05.963
Each time, a single victim,
ritual killing.

13:05.965 --> 13:07.598
- Were there any leads?
- No hard suspects.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.434
But there is something interesting

13:10.436 --> 13:13.192
about the very first case.

13:13.839 --> 13:15.405
A witness.

13:15.407 --> 13:17.574
Catherine Fleming, age 34,

13:17.576 --> 13:21.278
was thrown off the roof
of a building in Amsterdam.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.947
Her seven-year-old son David was there.

13:23.949 --> 13:25.616
He was traumatized,
couldn't talk about it.

13:25.618 --> 13:27.284
Couldn't or wouldn't?
He saw it, or didn't.

13:27.286 --> 13:29.153
Well, that's the question.

13:29.155 --> 13:31.755
They've tried hypnosis,
therapy... nothing.

13:31.757 --> 13:33.524
You're not gonna believe this.

13:33.526 --> 13:34.758
He's here.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.627
- Who's here?
- Your witness.

13:36.629 --> 13:40.297
David Fleming, 19 now, violin virtuoso,

13:40.299 --> 13:43.033
performing at the Manhattan
School of Music...

13:43.035 --> 13:44.134
this week.

13:44.136 --> 13:45.169
That can't be a coincidence.

13:45.171 --> 13:46.203
No, but I don't think

13:46.205 --> 13:47.471
a seven-year-old was our killer,

13:47.473 --> 13:49.706
and any witness who doesn't
have a memory is not a witness.

13:49.708 --> 13:53.844
Unless we can help him remember.

14:04.156 --> 14:05.662
Sounds...

14:06.559 --> 14:08.081
sad.

14:08.587 --> 14:11.221
Must be coming from upstairs.

14:11.297 --> 14:12.627
Yeah.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.714
I feel like I'm on a leash.

14:17.336 --> 14:19.169
You can always ignore him.

14:19.171 --> 14:21.004
Lord knows I do.

14:21.006 --> 14:22.929
Easier said than done.

14:23.309 --> 14:25.598
It's like putting God on mute.

14:26.745 --> 14:28.011
Yeah, Lincoln.

14:28.013 --> 14:30.414
Turn on your body cam now.

14:30.416 --> 14:31.515
Why? What is it?

14:31.517 --> 14:33.517
The killer is there, streaming.

14:33.519 --> 14:35.550
Called this his prologue.

14:36.388 --> 14:38.528
David must be the next target.

14:39.425 --> 14:42.159
He's here. Streaming live.

14:42.161 --> 14:44.561
I'll follow the sound of the music.

14:44.563 --> 14:47.064
Lincoln, give me something to go on.

14:47.066 --> 14:49.566
Felix called up the
blueprints of the concert hall.

14:49.568 --> 14:51.201
There's a rehearsal space above you.

14:51.203 --> 14:52.736
Try shouting.

14:52.738 --> 14:54.738
David Fleming!

14:57.843 --> 15:00.944
The feed stopped. The killer heard you.

15:00.946 --> 15:02.179
Lincoln, I'm worried.

15:02.181 --> 15:04.929
David, lock your door!

15:08.687 --> 15:10.454
I'd call for backup, but I'm close.

15:10.456 --> 15:11.455
I'm going in.

15:14.693 --> 15:17.694
Be careful. He knows we're here.

15:22.368 --> 15:23.700
Sellitto?

15:23.702 --> 15:26.403
I'm not hit. I'm on the top hallway.

15:26.405 --> 15:28.745
Shots came from across.

15:29.927 --> 15:31.660
He's on your level.

15:32.911 --> 15:34.292
Okay.

15:35.281 --> 15:36.580
We can't let him get to David.

15:36.582 --> 15:38.282
See if you can drive him down to me.

15:38.284 --> 15:39.922
I don't like that plan.

15:40.286 --> 15:44.588
Please, Lincoln, I jumped
in front of a subway train.

15:44.590 --> 15:47.591
You think I can't handle
a killer with a gun?

15:47.593 --> 15:48.558
Do it.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.060
Moving into position.

15:50.062 --> 15:52.963
I'm gonna shoot to drive him
away from the music.

15:57.569 --> 15:59.336
I see him. He's running.

16:03.575 --> 16:04.908
I'll go find David.

16:07.946 --> 16:10.447
Lincoln, any idea where he could be?

16:10.449 --> 16:12.182
There's a catwalk just below the hallway.

16:12.184 --> 16:13.924
Must've climbed down.

16:16.088 --> 16:17.543
On it.

16:31.937 --> 16:33.437
Targets are safe.

16:33.439 --> 16:36.940
NYPD. Don't worry. Just sit tight.

16:47.786 --> 16:50.987
I hear footsteps. Careful, now.

16:58.464 --> 16:59.830
I'm in pursuit.

16:59.832 --> 17:02.399
That door leads to the southwest exit.

17:16.482 --> 17:18.013
There's no one.

17:20.152 --> 17:22.150
Lincoln, he's gone.

17:27.509 --> 17:29.344
Why would somebody target me?

17:29.346 --> 17:31.980
There was a murder in Queens
this morning, David.

17:35.110 --> 17:39.179
It has similarities
to your mother's murder.

17:40.590 --> 17:42.257
What kind of similarities?

17:42.259 --> 17:44.059
The Wrath of the Gods.

17:48.532 --> 17:50.699
We know you were there

17:50.701 --> 17:53.001
the night your mother died.

17:53.003 --> 17:55.437
Yeah, but I don't remember any of it.

17:55.439 --> 17:57.539
Well, I understand that.

17:57.541 --> 17:59.562
Believe me, I do.

18:01.063 --> 18:03.678
What we're asking is if there's anything,

18:03.680 --> 18:05.380
an image, a fragment,

18:05.382 --> 18:08.696
something that could help us.

18:09.086 --> 18:12.700
In trauma, that's how people see things.

18:13.724 --> 18:15.912
Lots of fragments.

18:16.426 --> 18:18.226
They can be very vivid.

18:18.228 --> 18:21.196
Babe? You're upsetting him.

18:21.198 --> 18:23.465
We're not trying to do that, Ally.

18:23.467 --> 18:25.567
We're trying to save someone else

18:25.569 --> 18:27.780
from losing someone they love.

18:31.241 --> 18:33.387
What I remember about my mom...

18:35.946 --> 18:38.079
she liked to indulge
in whatever she wanted.

18:38.081 --> 18:39.936
She did whatever she wanted.

18:40.450 --> 18:41.979
And...

18:44.254 --> 18:47.455
she got thrown off the roof
of our high-rise.

18:49.826 --> 18:53.286
Retribution for her self-indulgence.

18:56.733 --> 18:59.100
When I see her...

18:59.102 --> 19:00.665
um...

19:01.738 --> 19:04.418
that fragment that
you're talking about...

19:07.755 --> 19:09.215
It's her smile.

19:11.081 --> 19:12.480
Yeah.

19:12.482 --> 19:14.249
She used to smile.

19:14.251 --> 19:17.285
So would I love to help catch
whoever did this?

19:17.287 --> 19:18.319
Yeah, of course,

19:18.321 --> 19:19.892
but...

19:20.791 --> 19:22.436
will I be able to help?

19:24.494 --> 19:26.065
Mm-mm.

19:26.930 --> 19:29.631
If I saw anything that night, I...

19:29.633 --> 19:31.284
I don't remember.

19:34.204 --> 19:36.838
They've clearly been painted
by the same artist.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.306
Well, Kate's running through
everything from paint

19:38.308 --> 19:39.707
to style identifiers.

19:39.709 --> 19:41.709
So David is Orpheus.

19:41.711 --> 19:44.012
Taught to play by Apollo himself.

19:44.014 --> 19:46.214
His music was so beautiful,

19:46.216 --> 19:48.149
it could charm the animals
and make the trees dance.

19:48.151 --> 19:49.851
The mother represents Icarus,

19:49.853 --> 19:51.619
boy who flew too close to the sun.

19:51.621 --> 19:52.954
When the wax in his wings melted,

19:52.956 --> 19:55.456
he tumbled out of the sky into the sea.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.225
Reason why I don't fly.

19:57.227 --> 19:59.694
You refuse to fly based on a myth?

19:59.696 --> 20:00.862
We work together this long,

20:00.864 --> 20:02.397
and you don't know that about me?

20:02.399 --> 20:05.233
I know you play the banjo
and brew your own beer.

20:05.235 --> 20:08.036
That's enough personal
knowledge for me, Felix.

20:08.038 --> 20:10.894
I also do origami. Helps me relax.

20:10.896 --> 20:12.207
Well, we can't relax.

20:12.209 --> 20:13.908
The killer is openly taunting us,

20:13.910 --> 20:15.743
telling us he's going to strike again.

20:15.745 --> 20:18.200
We're gonna catch this one, Linc.

20:19.516 --> 20:21.287
And then one day soon...

20:22.018 --> 20:24.290
We're gonna catch the Bone Collector.

20:37.067 --> 20:41.202
♪ It's over, it's over ♪

20:41.204 --> 20:45.773

20:45.775 --> 20:48.009

21:06.796 --> 21:08.429
I've got something.

21:10.378 --> 21:12.033
Something on the paintings?

21:12.035 --> 21:13.434
Connoisseurship.

21:13.436 --> 21:15.303
The ability to determine which artist

21:15.305 --> 21:19.774
painted a specific picture
based on signature style.

21:19.776 --> 21:21.943
Brushstrokes,

21:21.945 --> 21:24.112
swirls, shading, use of color.

21:24.114 --> 21:26.114
- An artistic fingerprint.
- Exactly.

21:26.116 --> 21:27.949
They couldn't have even done this before,

21:27.951 --> 21:30.418
but now, using a neural AI algorithm,

21:30.420 --> 21:32.453
we can spot specific identifiers.

21:32.455 --> 21:33.321
Felix?

21:33.323 --> 21:35.123
So if I take scans of each panting...

21:35.125 --> 21:36.838
And plug them into an internationally

21:36.840 --> 21:37.892
curated database...

21:37.894 --> 21:40.328
We may just be able to find this artist.

21:40.330 --> 21:43.598
Question is, is the artist the killer,

21:43.600 --> 21:46.634
or did the artist
sell the killer the paintings?

21:46.636 --> 21:48.937
You found me by my style?

21:48.939 --> 21:50.271
I have no style.

21:50.273 --> 21:51.806
I mean, no style is my style.

21:51.808 --> 21:54.142
Each work is unique.

21:54.144 --> 21:55.810
Right.

21:55.812 --> 21:57.812
Well, there were enough
identifiers to match you work

21:57.814 --> 21:59.814
to an international artist database.

21:59.816 --> 22:00.949
Well, that's crazy.

22:00.951 --> 22:02.930
I never do the same thing twice.

22:04.087 --> 22:08.060
What about doing the same thing 18 times?

22:09.793 --> 22:11.159
Oh.

22:11.161 --> 22:12.587
Oh, I had forgotten about those.

22:12.589 --> 22:14.162
Well, these paintings
were found at the scene

22:14.164 --> 22:17.319
of a murder this morning.

22:18.501 --> 22:20.768
Actually, there was a whole
string of murders

22:21.157 --> 22:23.171
spanning back 12 years.

22:23.173 --> 22:25.672
Your paintings
were connected to all of them.

22:25.674 --> 22:28.176
And lo and behold,
you're here in New York.

22:28.178 --> 22:30.611
Oh, my God. You serious?

22:30.613 --> 22:33.127
You want to tell us
who has those paintings?

22:33.683 --> 22:35.383
Uh...

22:35.385 --> 22:36.566
this is so long.

22:36.568 --> 22:38.720
I sold that collection years ago.

22:38.722 --> 22:39.721
Do you remember to who?

22:39.723 --> 22:40.988
A name, an address.

22:40.990 --> 22:44.025
It was a... it was a dealer,
uh, in London.

22:44.027 --> 22:46.294
We're gonna need that name.

22:46.296 --> 22:49.731
Unfortunately,
I'm not one for record-keeping.

22:49.733 --> 22:52.200
I'm sorry. I wish...
I wish I remembered more.

22:52.202 --> 22:55.136
You sure? That's a lot of paintings.

22:55.138 --> 22:56.371
Must've been a big sale.

22:56.373 --> 22:57.839
Well...

22:57.841 --> 22:59.640
it's the artist's way.

22:59.642 --> 23:03.211
You create with your soul,
you put it out in the world,

23:03.213 --> 23:05.880
the world does with it what it does,

23:05.882 --> 23:07.048
you move on.

23:07.050 --> 23:10.497
You have a thing for Greek mythology.

23:12.166 --> 23:14.822
Vengeance, perhaps?

23:14.824 --> 23:19.394
Well, myths embody the drama
of the human condition.

23:19.396 --> 23:22.897
They're as relevant now as when
the Greeks first imagined them.

23:22.899 --> 23:24.365
And it's not just vengeance.

23:24.367 --> 23:28.770
I mean, myths explore love, lust, loss,

23:28.772 --> 23:31.439
death, the darkness in us all.

23:33.176 --> 23:35.176
And what's your darkness?

23:42.162 --> 23:43.129
Yeah?

23:43.131 --> 23:44.185
You still with Calder?

23:44.187 --> 23:45.186
We are.

23:45.188 --> 23:46.788
It's not him.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.040
Are you sure about that?

23:48.042 --> 23:51.110
The killer's back online
with another victim.

23:51.112 --> 23:52.581
Live.

23:52.947 --> 23:54.458
Okay.

23:56.684 --> 23:59.585
Prometheus stole fire from the gods,

23:59.587 --> 24:01.520
and gave it to man,

24:01.522 --> 24:05.190
a gift that burned their hands
while it lit their way.

24:05.192 --> 24:07.526
Killer chose his next myth.

24:07.528 --> 24:09.261
The fire of Prometheus.

24:09.263 --> 24:10.462
Oh, my God.

24:23.019 --> 24:24.405
Have you seen enough?

24:28.792 --> 24:30.526
Lincoln?

24:30.528 --> 24:32.160
Yes, I've seen enough.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.832
Sound of the jets landing,

24:36.834 --> 24:39.268
view of the Whitestone Bridge
out the window.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.270
We had just enough information

24:41.272 --> 24:43.972
on the live feed to find this place.

24:43.974 --> 24:45.374
But not enough time.

24:45.376 --> 24:47.376
Landlord says the guy's name
is Gary Saunders.

24:47.378 --> 24:48.477
What do we know about him?

24:48.479 --> 24:50.212
He was a low-life drug dealer.

24:50.214 --> 24:53.482
Guy was selling Oxy and Percs
to Wall Streeters and NYU kids.

24:53.484 --> 24:55.851
Show me the room. Scour for trace.

24:56.312 --> 24:57.452
Not much here.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.021
You know the rules.

24:59.023 --> 25:00.889
Whatever the conditions,
the killer left something,

25:00.891 --> 25:01.890
and took something away.

25:01.892 --> 25:02.991
No... I got it.

25:02.993 --> 25:04.536
Look closer.

25:04.538 --> 25:06.194
Turn him off.

25:06.196 --> 25:08.365
- Huh?
- Turn him off.

25:11.902 --> 25:13.902
You want to know the key
to working with Lincoln Rhyme?

25:13.904 --> 25:15.737
Xanax?

25:15.739 --> 25:19.007
It's remembering he has a fatal flaw.

25:19.009 --> 25:20.409
He cares too much.

25:20.411 --> 25:22.077
And he has a God complex.

25:22.079 --> 25:24.846
Maybe he does.
He's also angry and impatient.

25:24.848 --> 25:26.183
But the truth is...

25:26.185 --> 25:28.817
And don't you ever quote me on this...

25:28.819 --> 25:31.219
He is smarter than the rest of us.

25:31.221 --> 25:33.188
Not in all ways.

25:33.190 --> 25:35.357
Sometimes he can't see
the forest for the trees,

25:35.359 --> 25:38.729
but if you can get past the bluster...

25:39.813 --> 25:41.440
he'll make you better.

25:42.266 --> 25:43.398
All right.

25:58.282 --> 26:02.044
Another feather? Can't be a coincidence.

26:02.586 --> 26:04.052
Prometheus.

26:04.054 --> 26:06.088
He gave the human race the gift of fire.

26:06.090 --> 26:09.057
An action for which
he was punished by Zeus,

26:09.059 --> 26:13.028
who had an eagle eat his liver
to prolong his suffering.

26:13.030 --> 26:15.631
Yeah, but the story doesn't make sense.

26:15.633 --> 26:18.634
I mean, Prometheus gave people fire.

26:18.636 --> 26:20.936
Gary Saunders was a drug dealer.

26:20.938 --> 26:22.273
In this case,

26:22.275 --> 26:23.972
opioids are the metaphorical equivalent,

26:23.974 --> 26:26.443
a substance people can't handle.

26:27.194 --> 26:30.045
Another victim
being punished for their sins.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.282
Speaking of sins...

26:34.318 --> 26:36.286
You turned me off.

26:37.087 --> 26:38.820
That's not how this works.

26:38.822 --> 26:41.089
You're here so I can be there.

26:41.091 --> 26:42.793
I understand that.

26:43.794 --> 26:46.328
But you need to treat me
like a colleague,

26:46.330 --> 26:48.424
not a piece of equipment.

26:49.133 --> 26:51.933
You've seen how I treat my colleagues?

26:52.737 --> 26:53.782
Good point.

26:53.784 --> 26:56.473
I think I know why the killer
may have targeted David Fleming.

26:57.007 --> 26:59.007
Magazine interview he gave two weeks ago.

26:59.009 --> 27:03.345
He said some things
that put him in the crosshairs.

27:05.783 --> 27:07.916
You gave an interview
to New York Magazine

27:07.918 --> 27:09.785
where you talked
about your mother's death

27:09.787 --> 27:12.087
and the fact that you don't remember.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.855
I don't.

27:13.857 --> 27:17.325
You said you recently
became interested in myths.

27:17.327 --> 27:19.995
Stories, the imagery.

27:19.997 --> 27:24.466
You also said that you see
those images in your dreams.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.870
Wings with feathers.

27:28.872 --> 27:30.579
Like this?

27:39.641 --> 27:42.317
David? Honey, you okay?

27:42.319 --> 27:43.896
Yeah.

27:44.938 --> 27:46.375
Exactly like this.

27:52.830 --> 27:55.130
What if it wasn't a dream?

27:55.132 --> 27:58.800
What if it was your memory?

27:59.244 --> 28:01.415
So you're saying the feathers

28:01.417 --> 28:03.957
are connected to my mother's murder?

28:04.791 --> 28:06.960
I saw something, and now...

28:07.311 --> 28:09.171
he's trying to kill me?

28:09.838 --> 28:11.079
If memory's coming back,

28:11.081 --> 28:13.749
you might be able to ID whoever did this.

28:13.751 --> 28:16.803
And the killer needs to stay hidden.

28:17.254 --> 28:19.473
So who knows how far he'd go?

28:19.890 --> 28:22.924
Clearly our killer has taken
on the identity of Nemesis.

28:22.926 --> 28:25.761
Are we really saying
that our killer put on wings?

28:25.763 --> 28:28.530
Put on, had some representation of.

28:28.532 --> 28:29.922
It's part of a ritual.

28:29.924 --> 28:32.000
Well, whatever it was,

28:32.002 --> 28:35.771
the fire that took Prometheus
may be Nemesis's undoing.

28:35.773 --> 28:36.772
What do you have?

28:36.774 --> 28:38.406
A new kind of acetone.

28:38.408 --> 28:39.875
Four times more flammable,

28:39.877 --> 28:42.277
and only being used in one place,

28:42.279 --> 28:43.678
a lab at the College of Manhattan,

28:43.680 --> 28:45.514
which reported a break-in last week.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.266
Well, how does that help us find Nemesis?

28:47.268 --> 28:48.950
Well, I put together a list of experts.

28:48.952 --> 28:50.919
Now, there's a visiting
professor of mythology

28:50.921 --> 28:52.854
at the College of Manhattan
this semester.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.509
That's not a red flag on its own, but...

28:56.093 --> 28:58.393
meet Irene Antoni,

28:58.395 --> 28:59.628
who's taught similar courses

28:59.630 --> 29:03.465
in Chicago, Boston, and Amsterdam.

29:03.467 --> 29:04.866
Amelia, call Sellitto.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.720
Yeah, on it.

29:07.905 --> 29:10.438
We may be looking at our killer.

29:10.440 --> 29:14.276
So when your neighbor
is struck by a lightning bolt,

29:14.278 --> 29:17.813
or your friend is turned into a creature,

29:17.815 --> 29:20.549
you're gonna walk the line, right?

29:20.551 --> 29:21.817
So I'll see you guys Friday.

29:24.154 --> 29:27.489
Professor Antoni.
Detective Sellitto, NYPD.

29:27.491 --> 29:28.757
Officer Amelia Sachs.

29:28.759 --> 29:30.910
Oh, the Wrath of the Gods.

29:30.912 --> 29:32.661
So you've heard of the case?

29:32.663 --> 29:33.962
The news is gripping the city.

29:33.964 --> 29:35.764
Everyone's talking about it.

29:35.766 --> 29:38.066
Yeah, and the killer
appears to be obsessed

29:38.068 --> 29:39.835
with Greek mythology.

29:39.837 --> 29:42.003
You've taught in Chicago, Boston,

29:42.005 --> 29:44.531
and the Netherlands, correct?

29:44.533 --> 29:47.843
Correct. And a number of other cities.

29:47.845 --> 29:49.311
What are you suggesting?

29:49.313 --> 29:51.246
Based on what you
were telling your disciples...

29:51.248 --> 29:53.315
- Students.
- I'm thinking we have motive.

29:53.340 --> 29:57.352
Look, do I see the failings
of modern society?

29:57.354 --> 30:00.856
Do I view them
through the prisms of myths?

30:00.858 --> 30:03.525
Yes, I do. Do I act out them?

30:03.527 --> 30:06.261
O-of course not. Don't be ridiculous.

30:06.263 --> 30:07.706
It's purely academic.

30:07.708 --> 30:10.298
Well, maybe your...

30:10.300 --> 30:14.703
anger has inspired someone
without you even knowing it.

30:14.705 --> 30:17.505
Perhaps a student, colleague,

30:17.507 --> 30:20.167
maybe a crazed fan.

30:20.169 --> 30:21.643
Fan?

30:21.645 --> 30:23.178
We don't have fans.

30:23.180 --> 30:25.046
I teach the classics.

30:25.048 --> 30:26.715
But if you think you can come here

30:26.717 --> 30:29.391
and throw these accusations at me

30:29.393 --> 30:31.271
and then ask for my help...

30:31.989 --> 30:33.021
no.

30:33.023 --> 30:34.890
Maybe not.

30:34.892 --> 30:37.025
But we should probably
continue this conversation

30:37.027 --> 30:39.194
at the precinct.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.329
Look, I'm not from your country,

30:41.331 --> 30:43.064
but I know how things work,

30:43.066 --> 30:45.700
and you don't get to haul me
based on the fact

30:45.702 --> 30:47.869
that I lived in a few major cities.

30:47.871 --> 30:50.972
Good luck with that.
You'll have to excuse me.

30:51.320 --> 30:53.251
I have another class.

30:55.679 --> 30:57.679
We'll put a couple of unis on her.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.196
She's not gonna leave our sight.

30:59.198 --> 31:00.815
Did you see the way you set her off?

31:02.819 --> 31:03.852
Hey, Lincoln...

31:03.854 --> 31:04.986
Get to the concert hall.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.021
Why? What's happened?

31:06.023 --> 31:07.222
Something was bothering me.

31:07.224 --> 31:08.486
We knew David was Orpheus

31:08.488 --> 31:09.773
because he's a musician,

31:09.775 --> 31:12.527
and we assumed the attack was
to keep him from remembering.

31:12.529 --> 31:13.931
- Right.
- But the painting shows

31:13.933 --> 31:16.577
his descent into hell
to retrieve his wife Eurydice.

31:16.579 --> 31:19.100
When he looks back to see
what he's not meant to see,

31:19.321 --> 31:21.054
he damns her to hell for all eternity.

31:21.056 --> 31:24.616
His tragedy costs her her life.

31:25.060 --> 31:26.660
Oh, my God.

31:26.662 --> 31:28.629
Ally's the target.

31:28.631 --> 31:30.330
We have David in protective custody,

31:30.332 --> 31:31.498
but Ally went to the concert hall.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.583
No one's seen her since.

31:34.570 --> 31:36.236
We have to get to her before he does.

31:40.708 --> 31:42.008
Sheet music on the floor.

31:42.010 --> 31:44.878
Looks like the contents of Ally's purse.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.692
There was a struggle.

31:46.694 --> 31:48.972
What's that spot over there on the floor?

31:54.162 --> 31:57.230
Some sort of fine sand.

32:00.301 --> 32:03.002
Someone lost a button
during the struggle.

32:04.672 --> 32:06.806
Could be from the artist's overalls?

32:06.808 --> 32:08.152
Calder.

32:08.154 --> 32:09.976
Sometimes the smallest mistake

32:09.978 --> 32:11.477
will help us catch them.

32:58.026 --> 33:00.593
Unis are conducting
a citywide search for Ally.

33:00.595 --> 33:03.696
Calder alibis out
for the first two killings.

33:04.007 --> 33:06.232
For the second, we're his alibi.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.700
And Antoni, the professor,

33:07.702 --> 33:09.302
she was with you when Ally went missing.

33:09.304 --> 33:12.832
So our two main suspects
couldn't have done it.

33:12.834 --> 33:13.918
Not alone.

33:13.920 --> 33:14.907
You think they're working together?

33:14.909 --> 33:15.942
Folie a deux.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.611
A shared psychosis
in which delusional beliefs

33:18.613 --> 33:21.247
are transferred
from one person to another.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.482
They feed off of each other,

33:22.484 --> 33:24.312
so alone, they're benign,

33:24.314 --> 33:26.953
but together, they become dangerous.

33:26.955 --> 33:29.222
So what's the connection
between Antoni and Calder?

33:29.224 --> 33:30.556
Amsterdam.

33:30.558 --> 33:32.258
The city where the killings began.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.393
Calder spent a semester
there 12 years ago.

33:34.395 --> 33:37.830
He studied Greek mythology
taught by Professor Antoni.

33:37.832 --> 33:41.434
So Calder buys into her
Wrath of the Gods BS,

33:41.436 --> 33:44.470
and Antoni sees she has a real believer.

33:44.472 --> 33:46.005
- Partner in crime.
- Folie a deux.

33:46.007 --> 33:48.407
But it doesn't help us
find Ally, not at all.

33:48.409 --> 33:50.009
The reenactment is about hell.

33:50.470 --> 33:51.744
Had Ally been thrown out the window

33:51.746 --> 33:53.479
in that rehearsal room,

33:53.481 --> 33:54.947
she would've landed in Hell's Kitchen.

33:54.949 --> 33:55.915
Hey.

33:55.917 --> 33:58.122
I tested the sand
found at the concert hall.

33:58.124 --> 33:59.685
It's finely ground silica

33:59.687 --> 34:02.154
with traces of resin
and small chips of glass.

34:02.156 --> 34:03.422
Multicolored.

34:03.424 --> 34:05.858
Iron oxide and chromium in the glass.

34:05.860 --> 34:06.926
Yes.

34:08.862 --> 34:11.864
The resin says it's from
sandblasting, repainting.

34:11.866 --> 34:14.000
The glass, iron oxide, and chromium,

34:14.002 --> 34:15.456
used for color.

34:15.458 --> 34:16.636
Used in...

34:18.940 --> 34:20.438
Stained glass.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.041
We're looking for a church.

34:22.043 --> 34:24.710
Heaven or hell, right?
I mean, that's gotta be it.

34:24.712 --> 34:26.112
Yeah, but which church?

34:26.114 --> 34:28.114
I mean, most of the ones
I've been to preach

34:28.116 --> 34:29.282
about heaven, not hell.

34:29.284 --> 34:31.449
They should.

34:31.452 --> 34:33.018
Which is why Pastor Julian Marks

34:33.021 --> 34:35.855
was removed from his parish
for preaching to his flock

34:35.857 --> 34:38.456
they were all going to hell.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.525
The whole parish.

34:40.527 --> 34:43.896
He started on Matthew 25.

34:43.898 --> 34:45.697
"Then shall he say also unto them

34:45.699 --> 34:46.866
"on the left hand,

34:46.868 --> 34:48.367
"'Depart from me, ye cursed,

34:48.369 --> 34:50.036
into everlasting fire.'"

34:50.038 --> 34:51.864
Which parish, Lincoln?

34:52.340 --> 34:54.618
Felix, St. James Church?

34:56.177 --> 34:57.338
Closed this week.

34:57.340 --> 34:59.078
They're repainting the whole exterior.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.247
So Calder has free rein
to take Ally there.

35:01.249 --> 35:02.751
Let's go.

35:09.257 --> 35:10.690
I'm gonna get the unis.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.094
I'll set a perimeter,
and check the grounds.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.862
You think it helps or hurts
that he's on his own?

35:16.864 --> 35:19.098
We still have Irene under surveillance.

35:19.100 --> 35:22.034
Well, his psychopathy
is fueled by his partner,

35:22.036 --> 35:25.438
plus, he knows we're closing in.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.707
So he could snap any second.

35:27.709 --> 35:31.377
Yeah. We have to find Ally now.

35:35.583 --> 35:37.049
It's hell.

35:40.855 --> 35:42.755
Oh, my God, he's gonna throw her off.

35:42.757 --> 35:43.891
Into his metaphorical hell.

35:46.861 --> 35:47.960
Where are the shots coming from?

35:47.962 --> 35:49.103
No idea.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.430
ESU's ten minutes out.

35:58.432 --> 36:01.099
Okay, I'm going. We can't wait.

36:01.101 --> 36:03.135
If you go up there,
you're walking into an ambush.

36:03.137 --> 36:04.670
And if I don't, she dies.

36:04.672 --> 36:06.839
- Amelia...
- You want Sellitto to do it?

36:06.841 --> 36:08.073
Better risk him than me?

36:08.075 --> 36:10.843
No, you're right.

36:11.145 --> 36:12.744
But you and Sellitto both go.

36:12.746 --> 36:15.080
I think the shots came from over there.

36:15.082 --> 36:16.114
Okay.

36:19.453 --> 36:21.953
Stop. On your left.

36:26.460 --> 36:28.960
A feather. His trademark.

37:02.496 --> 37:04.529
Sellitto, do you have eyes on him?

37:04.531 --> 37:06.416
Nothing down here.

37:06.833 --> 37:09.334
It's okay. I'm gonna get you out of here.

37:09.336 --> 37:12.003
NYPD!

37:12.005 --> 37:14.005
Ah!

37:14.007 --> 37:15.607
Amelia!

37:24.051 --> 37:25.617
The world can only be made right

37:25.619 --> 37:28.186
when people know fear again.

37:31.024 --> 37:32.357
Sellitto!

37:32.359 --> 37:34.192
I can't get a clear shot.

37:36.163 --> 37:38.029
ESU is here. We're coming in.

37:50.143 --> 37:53.213
Amelia, you okay?

37:53.747 --> 37:55.256
I'm good.

37:59.052 --> 38:01.419
Okay. Okay.

38:01.421 --> 38:05.090
Ally, you're safe now.

38:05.092 --> 38:07.359
It's all over.

38:12.232 --> 38:13.932
Oh, thank God you're safe.

38:16.236 --> 38:19.322
Thanks to her. She was amazing.

38:19.573 --> 38:21.906
What you did, I don't have
any way to say thank you.

38:21.908 --> 38:23.660
You just did.

38:26.413 --> 38:29.214
I didn't think it was
possible for me to remember.

38:29.216 --> 38:31.126
You were protecting yourself.

38:31.585 --> 38:34.753
When you watch someone you love die,

38:34.755 --> 38:36.256
you just...

38:36.690 --> 38:38.923
you cope however you can.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.726
Sellitto told me what you just did.

38:50.145 --> 38:51.980
Lincoln picked well.

38:53.356 --> 38:54.973
Welcome to the team.

38:58.712 --> 39:00.071
Hey.

39:01.081 --> 39:04.215
Was this necessary?
Having me cuffed on campus?

39:04.217 --> 39:05.350
Yeah.

39:05.352 --> 39:08.420
Because in our country,
when we link you to 15 murders,

39:08.422 --> 39:10.290
you're done.

39:11.091 --> 39:12.290
The fact that you can link

39:12.292 --> 39:13.992
a student I taught years ago to this,

39:13.994 --> 39:15.727
it's nothing.

39:15.729 --> 39:18.463
We searched his place.
Turns out, he kept a journal.

39:18.465 --> 39:19.964
You won't get the punishment of the gods,

39:19.966 --> 39:23.011
but you will get the punishment
of the system.

39:23.337 --> 39:25.680
Sometimes it works pretty well.

39:26.773 --> 39:28.766
You're two for two.

39:29.609 --> 39:33.411
Is that praise
from the great Lincoln Rhyme?

39:33.413 --> 39:35.106
Praise.

39:36.183 --> 39:38.318
Tempered by observation.

39:39.186 --> 39:40.945
You're not afraid.

39:41.521 --> 39:43.755
That's a good thing, right?

39:43.757 --> 39:45.408
Sometimes.

39:46.293 --> 39:49.078
Sometimes fear provides caution.

39:50.130 --> 39:53.208
Sometimes caution
is the better part of valor.

39:54.368 --> 39:56.301
Would you have done any different?

39:56.303 --> 39:58.630
We're not talking about me.

39:59.506 --> 40:02.006
Lincoln, if I'm gonna be
your eyes and ears

40:02.008 --> 40:04.469
and arms and legs...

40:05.803 --> 40:08.264
I better know how you would do it.

40:09.516 --> 40:11.184
How about this?

40:12.152 --> 40:14.187
Maybe between the two of us,

40:14.855 --> 40:17.857
we try to do it better
than either of us would alone.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.411
Rache?

40:32.506 --> 40:34.472
Rache?

40:34.474 --> 40:36.401
_

40:36.426 --> 40:38.878
_

41:00.500 --> 41:02.901
Doesn't mean it's gone forever.

41:02.903 --> 41:04.536
It's just a toe.

41:08.875 --> 41:10.008
Tomorrow morning, first thing,

41:10.010 --> 41:12.453
we're doing my therapy exercises.

41:14.181 --> 41:15.832
I promise.

41:47.414 --> 41:51.316
Et nos ludere. It's Latin.

41:51.318 --> 41:53.618
It means "let's play."

41:53.620 --> 41:56.039
Get Sellitto on the phone.

41:57.624 --> 41:59.876
The Bone Collector's back.
