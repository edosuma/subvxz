I just wanted Papa
to make a new friend.

But I made everything worse.

It's true.
Dad has no friends.

be there for him,

his reputation later today.

- Can you let us
into the building?

my swag out this way anyway.

What up, Farm-Con!
My name is Bill Green!

08:35.290 --> 08:38.249
Oh, no, Chip has assumed
Papa's identity!

08:38.250 --> 08:41.539
As the humble, urban farmer
I am, I'd just like to say...

08:41.540 --> 08:44.459
I'm the only good farmer
in this city!

08:44.460 --> 08:47.669
You're all dumb!
Dumb, dumb, dummies!

08:47.670 --> 08:48.879
[all gasp]

08:48.880 --> 08:50.669
Oh, no! We gotta hurry!

08:50.670 --> 08:52.289
I can't believe
you made me choose

08:52.290 --> 08:54.539
between my son and my swag.

08:54.540 --> 08:55.879
[grunts] Come on, let's go!

08:55.880 --> 08:57.039
That's fine,

08:57.040 --> 08:58.749
let Gramma pick up your mess.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.289
That's right, I said it.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.249
Oh, and your veggies? Garbo!

09:03.250 --> 09:05.419
[muffled speech]

09:05.420 --> 09:07.959
Yeah! I love pesticide!

09:07.960 --> 09:10.119
- [both scream]
- Not the teeth! Not the teeth!

09:10.120 --> 09:11.919
Good work, Cricket!
Hold him down!

09:11.920 --> 09:14.379
People of Farm-Con!

09:14.380 --> 09:16.459
This man is not Bill Green!

09:16.460 --> 09:18.459
- That is Bill Green!
- [grunts]

09:18.460 --> 09:20.459
[muffled speech]

09:20.460 --> 09:21.919
Two Bill Greens?

09:21.920 --> 09:23.329
Which one do I shoot?

09:23.330 --> 09:24.789
Which one do I shoot?!

09:24.790 --> 09:27.379
- Who's the real one?
- He is.

09:27.380 --> 09:28.380
[gasps]

09:28.381 --> 09:29.459
[muffled speech]

09:29.460 --> 09:30.579
That's my friend

09:30.580 --> 09:32.539
and I'd know him anywhere.

09:32.540 --> 09:33.100
Say "ahh," Papa.

09:33.101 --> 09:36.379
Huh? [gurgling]

09:36.380 --> 09:38.829
Thanks, sweetie.
[blubbers]

09:38.830 --> 09:42.379
Papa, I'm really sorry
Chip didn't turn out
to be a good friend.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.289
Yeah, me too.

09:44.290 --> 09:45.579
How are you so heavy?!

09:45.580 --> 09:47.379
I'm dense!

09:47.380 --> 09:48.919
Huh? Ugh.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.419
Chip, I'm afraid after this,

09:50.420 --> 09:52.249
we can't be friendly anymore.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.749
[scoffs] Like I care.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.209
Watch your back, Bill Green.

09:55.210 --> 09:57.379
'Cause I'll get you all
sooner or later.

09:57.380 --> 09:59.039
When you least expect--

09:59.040 --> 10:01.169
- [groans]
- [grunts] Success!

10:01.170 --> 10:02.100
Well, time to go
to the pawn shop.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.579
- [grunting]
- [groans]

10:04.580 --> 10:06.379
Huh? Ha!

10:06.380 --> 10:09.669
My new titanium tooth
is still perfectly intact!

10:09.670 --> 10:11.379
Huh? [gasps]

10:11.380 --> 10:13.499
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!

10:13.500 --> 10:16.119
I'm not even gonna laugh.
I have nightmares about that.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.709
Everyone OK over here?

10:17.710 --> 10:19.879
Joe! It's been so long!

10:19.880 --> 10:21.789
Oh, it's great to see you again!

10:21.790 --> 10:22.790
Likewise.

10:22.791 --> 10:24.289
Listen, Bill,

10:24.290 --> 10:26.289
I'm sorry we lost touch
when you moved.

10:26.290 --> 10:28.099
I planned on visitin' but
I went out to tend the crops

10:28.100 --> 10:30.879
and well, you know...

10:30.880 --> 10:32.379
[chuckles] Boy, do I.

10:32.380 --> 10:35.419
What do ya say we catch up
over a nice glass of water?

10:35.420 --> 10:36.919
My favorite beverage,

10:36.920 --> 10:38.329
you remembered!

10:38.330 --> 10:39.579
Good Ol' Joe.

10:39.580 --> 10:40.919
Good Ol' Bill.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.289
Good Ol' Joe.

10:42.290 --> 10:43.499
Good Ol' Bill.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.169
-Good Ol'--
-Dad! Speech!

10:45.170 --> 10:46.749
Oh! Right!
Wish me luck!

10:46.750 --> 10:49.209
Well, we didn't find
Papa a new friend.

10:49.210 --> 10:51.039
But we did find him
an old friend.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.040
Yeah.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.040
Wait, did we?

10:53.040 --> 10:54.040
I'm countin' it.

10:54.041 --> 10:55.379
[clears throat]

10:55.380 --> 10:57.209
Hello, my name is Bill Green

10:57.210 --> 11:01.249
and I'm here to talk about
urban soil and crop rotation.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.499
[all cheer]

11:02.500 --> 11:04.210
I love Farm-Con!
