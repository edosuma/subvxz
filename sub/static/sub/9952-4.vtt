He wants to be chief?

00:20.271 --> 00:21.681
He wants to control whoever is.

That'd be your backstop.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.441
And what creates a power surge like that?

06:01.529 --> 06:03.144
That's where you might have to get creative.

06:03.239 --> 06:06.606
I'm not looking to get creative.
Did somebody sabotage the grid?

Listen, a person
can't dial up 1,000 gigawatts.

Of course, then we'd all be dead.

is with that Trouble.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.618
(SIGHS)

13:57.921 --> 13:59.627
This means nothing to you.

14:06.513 --> 14:10.552
Maybe you have an electrical trouble,
and your sub-aqua conductor, it helps you...

14:10.642 --> 14:12.974
Inductor, okay?

14:13.103 --> 14:15.515
I spent the last five years
of my life working on the thing.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.596
It's not supposed to conduct electricity.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.518
You were at the baseball game, Chris.
You were also at the hospital.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.568
We know that you had an argument
with your father

14:24.656 --> 14:26.271
on the phone right before he was killed.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.608
We had a discussion,
which I came to the hospital to finish.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.113
Finish how?

14:31.955 --> 14:34.662
See, 'cause from where I sit,
you have a pretty good motive.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.455
Why don't you like me?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.377
What were you arguing about?

14:41.465 --> 14:44.002
Everyone else in this town
is fawning over me.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.549
Except you.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.055
What makes you different?

14:53.685 --> 14:57.678
The way you feel about me
is the way I feel about most people.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.807
Then why do you coach baseball?

15:01.902 --> 15:03.688
Kids aren't people.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.859
That's people.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.991
Would you get out?

15:14.498 --> 15:15.988
You really think I'd kill for that?

15:16.083 --> 15:17.539
It didn't seem to bother your father.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.795
Of course not. He was a politician.

15:21.505 --> 15:23.370
-He ate it up.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.063
He didn't want people to know
who he was talking to.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.567
Mistresses maybe?
Could've had a network of them.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.359
This could be a crime of passion.

16:32.701 --> 16:35.659
I still think that someone
would kill to have this Trouble.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.656
Yeah. And while you
interrogate that someone,

16:37.747 --> 16:40.489
I'm in here hiding behind my desk lamp.

16:40.584 --> 16:44.168

Plus his gizmo fried my watch. Not him.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.669
Stan, I thought you were watching Chris.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.751
Well, he said he had to go
to his father's wake.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.879
-And so you just let him walk out of here?
-No.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.006
Danny took him over in the cruiser.

16:58.101 --> 17:01.434
Chris needed a ride. He volunteered.
Isn't Chris something else?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.728
Of course he did. We're going to a wake.

-Yeah.

One of them will know
where Rasmussen House is.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.275
If you can crack them,
they're the encyclopedias of Haven.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.280
It's the cracking part that can be problematic.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.531
Wait. How problematic?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.744
Well, between them, I'm zero for three.

17:23.293 --> 17:27.127
They're intense about the whole
"guardian of her secrets" thing.

-You're on.
-Hmm.

17:37.474 --> 17:41.183
Mrs. Brody, I'm sorry for your loss.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.309
Thank you so much for coming.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.513
It's just so lovely
that Richard has so many friends.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.724
I find it very comforting.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.476
And I don't know what I would do
without Reverend Driscoll.

and then slips away unseen.

Or maybe Chris Brody's personality
is literally electric and he did it himself.

So, whoever is responsible for all this
was in my home in the last few weeks.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.107
That's a frightening thought.

was troubled, right?

I'm sorry I have to ask.
Do you believe he was faithful?

Richard strayed once 27 years ago,
the last time The Troubles came.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.952

checked before he goes.

-You were sleeping.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.053
I can't see.

30:10.059 --> 30:11.970
Come on, come on.

30:15.439 --> 30:16.724
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

30:20.528 --> 30:22.064
EVI: What is it?

30:27.368 --> 30:30.235
Doesn't exactly look like something
that's gonna save my life.

30:30.329 --> 30:34.493
Yeah, but it's gorgeous.
And probably valuable.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.873
It's not what I came here for.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.130
"Omnia vincit amor. "

30:41.674 --> 30:43.084
Latin.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.251
"Love conquers all."

30:53.436 --> 30:54.801
Let's get out of here.

31:04.655 --> 31:07.738
No Rev, no Lori, no Felicia.

31:07.825 --> 31:10.066
Pulling an all-nighter
and got nothing to show for it.

31:10.161 --> 31:12.823
Hey, did you ever get the report back
on that microphone?

31:12.913 --> 31:15.700
Well, we know who we're looking for.
We just don't know where she is.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.327
Can you just check anyway?

31:17.626 --> 31:20.368
"Examined the dynamic microphone.
Cardioid pickup."

31:20.463 --> 31:24.081
Wait. "Ground wire faulty.
Shows signs of tampering."

31:24.425 --> 31:26.381
The ground wire gives the current
a safe place to go.

31:26.469 --> 31:28.425
Without it, all that voltage
went right through Brody.

31:28.512 --> 31:29.968
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)

31:31.474 --> 31:32.680
Hello?

31:32.892 --> 31:34.132
(STATIC)

31:34.727 --> 31:36.012
-Static?
-Yeah.

31:38.355 --> 31:39.515
Mine just crashed.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.060
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

31:49.658 --> 31:50.864
She's here somewhere.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.540
Oh, good. That's probably Chris.

32:00.628 --> 32:01.788
-Brody?
-Yeah.

32:01.879 --> 32:03.790
-What's he doing here?
-I texted him.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.998
What? Why?
The guy affects my decision-making, Parker.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.880
Okay. Then trust mine, all right?
We're gonna need him.

32:09.970 --> 32:13.007
-Hey. ljust tried calling you.
-I know.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.804
That's his plan?
You're not gonna look at me?

32:17.895 --> 32:19.101
-AUDREY 1: Yeah.
-Nope.

32:19.188 --> 32:22.396
-Works for me. Where's the nurse?
-We don't know quite yet.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.065
She's in the basement.

32:26.362 --> 32:28.569
-Okay, let's go.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

32:29.824 --> 32:33.112
If we go in there and Lori gets upset,
Chris could get seriously hurt.

32:33.202 --> 32:36.035
It's gonna be okay. Come on.

32:38.457 --> 32:43.417
From now on, your life is in this room,
with your thoughts and the Good Book.

32:43.879 --> 32:47.042
-You don't wanna hurt anyone else, do you?
-No.

32:49.510 --> 32:51.876
Lori, we're here to help.

32:54.515 --> 32:58.258
-Oh, God! It's happening again!
-CHRIS: Felicia, what's going on here?

32:58.352 --> 33:00.434
Chris, you shouldn't be here.
It's too dangerous.

33:00.521 --> 33:01.977
She's right.

33:03.566 --> 33:05.852
I am a monster.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.851
I killed your father.

33:11.198 --> 33:13.109
You didn't kill... OW!

33:14.201 --> 33:17.068
Lori, you're not a monster.

33:18.038 --> 33:21.030
Now, if you would just stay calm,
I think I can help you.

33:21.125 --> 33:22.240
(SCREAMS)

33:25.671 --> 33:27.502
AUDREY 1: She's getting worse.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.046
She's storing too much energy.

33:30.134 --> 33:32.341
Tweak her again,
she'll blow this whole church.

33:32.428 --> 33:35.386
All right, I did some repolarization work
on this thing.

33:37.141 --> 33:39.132
Great! Look what she did.

33:40.227 --> 33:41.933
This is why I hate people.

33:44.148 --> 33:46.935
I've still got some cables in my truck.
If I can get close enough to her,

33:47.026 --> 33:49.312
I could probably ground her
to the lightning rod outside.

33:49.403 --> 33:51.689
-Do you think that'll work?
-I mean,

33:52.239 --> 33:54.901
yeah, sure,
if you wanna bare-bones the thing.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.118
Chris, I need you to talk to her.

34:00.789 --> 34:03.622
If you can calm her down,
we can get close enough.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.826
Remember? She loves you.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.163
Yeah. Hey.

34:12.051 --> 34:16.670
Lori, I just wanted to ask you,

34:16.764 --> 34:19.506
are you sure you loved my dad?

34:20.434 --> 34:21.469
Whoa!

34:22.353 --> 34:25.595
Okay. Can you just try to talk
about something happier?

34:30.694 --> 34:33.527
I knew things about my father
that nobody else did.

34:35.908 --> 34:38.524
The ﬁrst thing he loved was the water.

34:40.037 --> 34:45.828
Summers for me as a young boy,
we would take a skiff out into the bay.

34:46.919 --> 34:50.252
We'd float, swim, snorkel all day.

34:50.339 --> 34:53.831
And then when the sun would start
to go down, he would always say,

34:55.511 --> 34:58.344
"Wouldn't it be great
if we never had to go back?"

34:59.014 --> 35:01.005
But you have memories
of your own with him,

35:02.017 --> 35:03.518
when you were happy.

35:04.979 --> 35:06.185
No. She's way too amped.

35:06.272 --> 35:09.184
Maybe we should wind her up
so she overloads.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.432
Drain the electricity out of her.

35:11.777 --> 35:16.020
Lori. Can you try to tell me how it all started?

35:18.993 --> 35:20.858
At Richard's house.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.614
We were...

35:24.290 --> 35:28.329
We were supposed to be talking
about what to do about us,

35:29.044 --> 35:32.377
and it turned into something else.
It wasn't supposed to.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.881
And then you walked in.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.468
You found them in the study.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.966
LORI: And I panicked,

35:42.474 --> 35:46.558
and then itjust felt like my insides exploded,

35:47.313 --> 35:49.554
and then sparks started coming off the wall.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.393
I'm sorry.

35:53.569 --> 35:56.561
I told you, for everything.

35:57.740 --> 36:01.403
You said you didn't know about his affairs
or the scorch marks.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.199
lwas humiliated.

36:03.412 --> 36:06.870
She admits she killed my husband.
Why are you coddling her?

36:07.166 --> 36:10.750
Because I don't think she did,
no matter what you let her believe.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.328
What are you talking about?

36:14.423 --> 36:16.209
You can't control your Trouble, Lori.

36:17.092 --> 36:21.711
The game, the wake, the hospital,
these were big emotional outbursts.

36:21.805 --> 36:24.467
Do you think you could
really direct electricity

36:24.600 --> 36:26.591
to a single microphone?

36:30.564 --> 36:31.679
No, you're lying.

36:31.774 --> 36:35.517
We have proof that someone tampered
with the ground wire on that microphone.

36:35.611 --> 36:37.147
Wait a second. What?

36:37.780 --> 36:39.111
The Mayor was murdered,

36:39.239 --> 36:41.491
and I think it was staged
to make it look like you did it.

36:41.617 --> 36:45.781
Question is, Mrs. Brody,
how much do you know about electricity?

36:47.623 --> 36:49.159
She knows enough.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.577
Chris, lwas helping her.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.750
No, you were manipulating her

36:53.837 --> 36:56.453
so you could get her to admit
to a crime that you committed.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.089
Or shame her into killing herself.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.963
-|s that true?
-No.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.299
Is it true?

37:18.153 --> 37:20.269
How could you be so cruel?

37:21.824 --> 37:23.439
FELICIA: What's happening?

37:35.170 --> 37:37.286
(LORI SCREAMING)

37:47.516 --> 37:49.347
You have no business here.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.847
This is Haven.
Making things disappear is my business.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.602
Come on, let the man do his job, Reverend.

37:54.982 --> 37:56.347
Gonna get done one way or the other.

37:56.525 --> 37:59.858
The good people of this community
need to know what happened here.

38:00.028 --> 38:03.111
Felicia drove your van,
took refuge in your church.

38:03.198 --> 38:06.110
You wouldn't want the good people
to think you had something to do with this?

38:06.201 --> 38:08.943
-Or Lori Fulcher almost dying?
-|s that a threat, Nathan?

38:10.456 --> 38:14.665
If I find out you knew anything about this,
I'll put you in jail.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.454
That's the threat.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.891
How do you take care of someone like that?

38:34.146 --> 38:37.138
She needs a new start.
You know, she needs relationships,

38:37.858 --> 38:40.975
people that keep her grounded.

38:41.862 --> 38:43.227
Sounds about right.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.491
Yeah.

38:46.575 --> 38:48.907
-Meet you at the truck.
-All right. Okay.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.969
Having me talk to her
was your plan the whole time, wasn't it?

39:11.225 --> 39:12.590
I'm sorry.

39:13.894 --> 39:15.805
You wouldn't have come
if I'd asked you to do that.

39:16.230 --> 39:17.595
You don't know me that well.

39:17.731 --> 39:19.813
I know that you've had
a pretty rough three days.

39:20.317 --> 39:22.933
Your dad died, your stepmom was arrested.

39:24.279 --> 39:25.610
Are you gonna be okay?

39:31.453 --> 39:33.284
I think you owe me that drink.

39:35.582 --> 39:38.119
The phytoplankton really is spectacular
this time of year.

39:40.754 --> 39:42.619
I look fon/vard to it.

39:44.007 --> 39:45.508
All right.

39:59.648 --> 40:00.854
Here.

40:01.358 --> 40:02.723
-Hey.
-Hey.

40:04.027 --> 40:05.437
This is a great day.

40:05.529 --> 40:08.862
All right, boys! Come on!
Let's make something happen!

40:10.867 --> 40:13.483
Brendan! Brendan! Watch the runner!

40:13.912 --> 40:17.496
Not me! I know I'm fascinating.
But I'm not important. The runner!

40:18.333 --> 40:19.709
The runner!

40:19.835 --> 40:21.075
(CROWD CHEERING)

40:28.927 --> 40:30.667
The field looks good as new.

40:34.182 --> 40:37.015
I like how you strong-armed
the Reverend the other day.

40:38.395 --> 40:39.726
Reminded me of your dad.

40:42.733 --> 40:44.473
We need people fighting for us.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.065
Yeah.

40:51.992 --> 40:53.152
We do.

41:06.840 --> 41:10.753
I'm sorry that you didn't get your answers
about your tattoo.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.093
That's okay.

41:14.056 --> 41:15.216
Yeah.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.474
Sometimes I think I should just let it go.

41:25.567 --> 41:28.104
Just let things be what they're gonna be.

41:28.695 --> 41:31.027
Wouldn't it be great if we could just

41:33.158 --> 41:34.694
let things go?

41:36.995 --> 41:39.327
That's never been a problem for me.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.084
Really?

41:50.717 --> 41:52.423
It wouldn't mean anything.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.009
Then do it.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.175
Come on, Crocker.
