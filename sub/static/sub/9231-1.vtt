02:23.241 --> 02:24.503
Hello.

02:24.576 --> 02:27.739
Mr. Brooks, there's a Margo Brofman
on the phone for you.

02:27.812 --> 02:31.805
- Oh, yeah? Put her through.
- Okay.

02:31.883 --> 02:34.181
- Hello?
- Hey, Margo.

02:34.252 --> 02:37.710
I'm giving a surprise party
Sunday night. Can you come?

02:37.789 --> 02:40.189
Who're you gonna surprise?

02:40.258 --> 02:41.190
You.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.618
- Who else is coming?
- Just Felicia and Liz.

02:45.697 --> 02:46.857
Oh, yeah?

02:49.401 --> 02:53.030
- What's the occasion?
- That's the surprise.

02:57.409 --> 02:59.877
- Hey, Mac.
- Nice-looking threads.

03:04.049 --> 03:06.609
- Can I take some roses?
- Help yourself.

03:06.685 --> 03:08.118
Thanks.

03:27.606 --> 03:29.540
Here you go.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.717
Come in, Steve.

03:49.861 --> 03:51.795
Looking good, slick.

04:05.377 --> 04:08.676
- Felicia.
- Hello, Steve.

04:09.748 --> 04:11.181
Thank you.

04:13.985 --> 04:16.112
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:17.889 --> 04:20.483
And Liz.

04:20.558 --> 04:22.822
- Hi, Steve.
- Hi.

04:54.125 --> 04:56.059
Hey, Margo.
Come on in.

05:04.202 --> 05:07.694
Unbelievable!

05:08.807 --> 05:11.275
Looking good there.

05:13.511 --> 05:15.741
Sexy!

05:15.814 --> 05:17.338
Unbelievable!

05:18.917 --> 05:21.317
Slick, you are something else!

05:25.323 --> 05:28.292
Come on, Margo.
It's my turn.

05:42.807 --> 05:44.240
Oh, yes.

05:47.512 --> 05:49.571
I don't believe this.

05:49.647 --> 05:53.879
I'm sitting here with three
beautiful women who said they hated me.

05:53.952 --> 05:58.013
- I gotta be dreaming.
- We still hate you.

05:59.424 --> 06:03.861
We decided you should be punished
for the way you treat women.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.190
Oh, yeah.

06:05.263 --> 06:08.824
Men like you
just have to be stopped.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.834
How're you gonna stop me?

06:10.902 --> 06:13.132
We're going to kill you.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.373
What a way to die.

06:52.811 --> 06:56.008
Oh, God.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.240
We did it.

06:57.315 --> 06:59.909
We still gotta get him out of
the hot tub and down to the river.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.918
- I don't think I can.
- You have to!

07:01.986 --> 07:03.920
We can't do it without you.

07:11.930 --> 07:13.158
You bitches.

08:00.745 --> 08:02.235
Where am I?

08:04.282 --> 08:05.943
Purgatory.

08:06.017 --> 08:09.111
- Where's that?
- Between heaven and hell.

08:10.889 --> 08:12.447
What happens now?

08:12.523 --> 08:16.516
On one hand, you've earned enough
credits to get you into heaven.

08:16.594 --> 08:19.392
- Thank God.
- You're welcome.

08:19.464 --> 08:24.265
On the other hand, you've been
so consistently rotten to women...

08:24.335 --> 08:26.599
you deserve to go
straight to hell.

08:26.671 --> 08:31.165
- That's pretty rotten.
- Perfect record. They all hate you.

08:31.242 --> 08:34.177
- All of them?
- As far as I know.

08:35.246 --> 08:36.837
You should know, but...

08:36.914 --> 08:39.975
it's kinda hard for me to believe
there aren't a couple of women--

08:40.051 --> 08:42.884
Right now I'll settle for one.

08:42.953 --> 08:45.684
So I've decided
that you should go back...

08:45.757 --> 08:50.854
and find one female
who truly likes Steve Brooks.

08:50.929 --> 08:53.124
If you find her,
you go to heaven.

08:53.197 --> 08:56.257
If you don 't,
you'll spend eternity in hell.

08:56.334 --> 08:59.633
- Back?
- Unless you have a better suggestion.

09:01.806 --> 09:04.741
Back's fine.
Back's terrific.

09:06.010 --> 09:08.478
Good morning. This is Ross Britain.
It's 8: 00 in the Big Apple.

09:08.546 --> 09:10.480
Here's Keith Slaughter
and the Butchers...

09:10.548 --> 09:14.177
pla ying what Jerry Falwell describes
as the devil's music.

09:44.716 --> 09:46.149
Excuse me.

09:47.719 --> 09:50.984
- Yes?
- I wish to lod ge a complaint.

09:51.055 --> 09:52.989
What is it this time?

09:53.057 --> 09:56.356
I have as much ri ght
to Steve Brooks' soul as you do.

09:56.427 --> 09:58.361
That's why I sent him back.

09:58.429 --> 10:02.695
Ifhe can't find one female who
likes him, then his soul is yours.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.600
That's not a fair test.

10:05.670 --> 10:08.537
He'll pick some helpless...

10:08.606 --> 10:11.006
unsuspecting female...

10:11.075 --> 10:13.669
pretend to be everything he's not.

10:13.745 --> 10:15.679
In the end she'll adore him.

10:15.747 --> 10:19.308
And you'll be honor-bound
to admit...

10:19.384 --> 10:22.615
an unregenerate debaucher
into heaven.

10:22.687 --> 10:25.554
What do you suggest?

10:25.623 --> 10:28.353
Teach him a lesson,
and at the same time...

10:28.426 --> 10:32.556
make it impossible for him
to work his macho machinations...

10:32.630 --> 10:36.896
on any more unsuspecting females.

10:36.968 --> 10:39.402
And how do I do that?

10:40.705 --> 10:41.637
Easy.

10:45.141 --> 10:47.166
Make him a woman.

11:02.325 --> 11:03.257
Security.

11:05.896 --> 11:08.160
Okay, Mrs. Wetherspoon.

11:08.231 --> 11:10.461
I'll take care of it
right away.

11:10.533 --> 11:14.060
Some woman's screaming her head off
in Brooks' apartment.

11:14.137 --> 11:15.126
Again?

11:21.344 --> 11:23.835
She didn't sound like the others.

11:23.914 --> 11:25.438
It was bloodcurdling.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.418
- You want I should call SWAT?
- No.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.673
Anybody here?

11:55.912 --> 11:58.312
Are you sure
you don't need a backup?

12:01.851 --> 12:02.943
It's Mac!

12:15.498 --> 12:17.864
Hey, lady. Miss?

12:17.934 --> 12:20.994
I'm up! I'm up!
What time is it?

12:27.110 --> 12:29.340
You okay?

12:29.412 --> 12:31.209
- What the hell happened?
- Easy.

12:31.281 --> 12:33.875
Looks like you fainted
or something.

12:33.950 --> 12:36.282
I guess I must have fainted
or something.

12:46.596 --> 12:48.530
Oh, yeah.

13:03.446 --> 13:05.539
Holy shit!

13:36.446 --> 13:38.141
Where's Mr. Brooks?

13:38.214 --> 13:40.409
Where's Mr. Brooks?

13:40.483 --> 13:42.747
- Who are you?
- Where's Mr. Brooks?

13:42.819 --> 13:45.083
Who am I?

13:49.092 --> 13:50.582
How'd you get in here?

13:50.660 --> 13:53.356
How do you know my name?
I never passed you through.

13:55.298 --> 13:58.563
- Al was on duty.
- He didn't tell me.

13:58.635 --> 14:00.569
You sign in?

14:01.971 --> 14:04.303
I don't remember.

14:04.374 --> 14:06.308
All guest are required
to sign the register.

14:06.376 --> 14:08.776
You couldn't have gotten in unless
Mr. Brooks said it was okay...

14:08.845 --> 14:10.779
and you signed that register.

14:14.284 --> 14:18.584
Mr. Brooks must have said it was okay
and I must have signed, right?

14:18.655 --> 14:21.123
Because here I am!

14:22.192 --> 14:24.126
Here I fucking am!

14:29.766 --> 14:33.395
- I'm not feeling too well.
- Want me to call a doctor?

14:39.976 --> 14:41.773
It's okay.

14:44.581 --> 14:47.175
You know, I just--
I kinda--

14:47.250 --> 14:49.946
I keeled over there
'cause I got some bad news...

14:50.019 --> 14:52.749
but I'm gonna shower, shave.

14:52.822 --> 14:55.313
I'm gonna
pull myself together here.

14:55.391 --> 14:59.122
You know how it is, Mac.
You get up on the wrong side of the bed.

14:59.195 --> 15:02.494
- You haven't brushed you teeth.
- When will Mr. Brooks come back?

15:02.565 --> 15:04.328
Not for a very long time.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.868
- Really?
- Yeah. He, uh--

15:06.936 --> 15:10.872
You see, he told me
that he was going away.

15:10.940 --> 15:13.306
- He's gone away.
- Yeah.

15:13.376 --> 15:17.039
And he asked me
to take care of his apartment.

15:17.113 --> 15:19.775
- You're taking care--
- Yeah. Because--

15:22.285 --> 15:24.412
- Because we're sisters.
- You're sisters?

15:24.487 --> 15:29.015
I'm the sister.
I mean, I'm his half sister.

15:29.092 --> 15:32.391
We have different mothers,
but he gave me his key...

15:32.462 --> 15:34.987
showed me how everything works...

15:35.064 --> 15:36.861
so I'm gonna be fine,
just fine.

15:37.934 --> 15:39.868
- Thanks a lot.
- Sure.

15:55.385 --> 15:57.216
How you doing there,
Mrs. Wetherspoon?

16:18.875 --> 16:21.139
Un-fucking-believable.

16:57.380 --> 17:00.008
- Hello?
- Hello.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.108
Hey, Walter.
How you doin', buddy?

17:03.119 --> 17:04.050
Who's this?

17:04.654 --> 17:06.588
Who is this?

17:09.559 --> 17:12.357
Okay, look, Walter.
I'm gonna try something here.

17:14.063 --> 17:15.325
I'm a woman.

17:16.432 --> 17:17.523
Yeah?

17:17.599 --> 17:21.400
It's me, Walter.
I'm a woman.

17:22.571 --> 17:24.199
Is this Connie?

17:24.941 --> 17:27.068
No, it isn't Connie.
It's me.

17:28.478 --> 17:30.810
Okay. Forget it.
I'm a man.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.611
I'm Amanda. I'm Steve's sister.

17:34.684 --> 17:36.982
Wait till you get a load of me.

17:37.053 --> 17:40.250
Steve doesn't have a sister.
Can I talk to Steve, please?

17:42.158 --> 17:44.149
You are--
I mean, you can't.

17:44.227 --> 17:47.162
It's after 1 0:00.
Steve hasn't shown up for work.

17:47.230 --> 17:49.721
Look, it's really complicated.

17:49.799 --> 17:53.565
Why don't you meet me for lunch
and I'll explain it to you.

17:53.636 --> 17:55.797
Steve would have told me
if he had a sister.

17:55.872 --> 17:57.601
No, he wouldn't.

17:58.574 --> 18:00.872
I'll meet you
at the City Grille at 1 :00.

18:00.943 --> 18:03.343
Wait, wait!
How I'm gonna know it's you?

18:04.847 --> 18:06.781
You can't miss me, pal.

18:06.849 --> 18:10.250
I'm blonde, about 5'7".

18:10.320 --> 18:12.345
Built like a brick shithouse.

18:17.827 --> 18:18.759
Desk.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.962
Yes, Mr. Reed.

18:23.032 --> 18:24.966
Hold on a second.

18:30.673 --> 18:34.439
- That's the broad.
- I never passed her by here.

18:34.510 --> 18:37.848
- You let her in?
- No, I didn't. She told me you--

18:37.848 --> 18:37.870
- You let her in?
- No, I didn't. She told me you--

18:40.183 --> 18:42.310
- Morning, May.
- Wait a minute.

18:42.385 --> 18:45.582
- She still in the sack?
- Wait a minute. You can't go up there!

18:45.655 --> 18:48.522
- I'd love a cup of coffee.
- Mrs. Brofman!

19:01.204 --> 19:03.638
Mrs. Brofman, open the door!

19:10.080 --> 19:11.342
What, May?

19:15.819 --> 19:18.845
- Who are you? Get out!
- Are you all right?

19:18.922 --> 19:20.184
Call the police!

19:20.257 --> 19:23.852
Then you could tell them all about
that little party you threw last night.

19:28.899 --> 19:29.831
What?

19:29.900 --> 19:32.664
Divers shouldn't have any trouble
finding the body.

19:36.439 --> 19:38.964
I can just hear
Felicia and Liz now.

19:39.042 --> 19:40.737
Oh, yeah.

19:40.810 --> 19:43.836
"We tried to drown him
in the hot tub, but...

19:43.914 --> 19:45.142
Margo shot him.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.741
Three times in the chest."

19:51.121 --> 19:53.783
Don't call the police.
Forget the police.

19:53.857 --> 19:55.586
- You sure?
- Yes.

19:55.659 --> 19:57.092
All right.

20:06.303 --> 20:07.531
Who are you?

20:09.806 --> 20:11.330
Where's the gun?

20:13.043 --> 20:15.011
Who the hell are you?

20:16.613 --> 20:18.979
Oh, take a good look, Margo.

20:19.049 --> 20:22.780
They say the eyes
are the windows to the soul.

20:22.852 --> 20:26.049
Look into my eyes.
Whose soul do you see?

20:28.091 --> 20:32.084
It's me, Margo-- Steve.

20:32.162 --> 20:34.392
You're crazy!

20:34.464 --> 20:37.661
I picked you because you're a lot
smarter than those other two bimbos.

20:37.734 --> 20:39.668
Also, you believe
that fag psychic of yours...

20:39.736 --> 20:42.864
told you you were Helen ofTroy
in another incarnation.

20:42.939 --> 20:46.033
Way I figure it,
you'd have no trouble believing...

20:46.109 --> 20:50.239
that I am the late, great
Steven Brooks, your ex-lover...

20:50.313 --> 20:53.714
reincarnated as a gorgeous female.

20:53.783 --> 20:55.182
Look deep, Margo.

21:01.725 --> 21:03.716
You better believe it, slick.

21:03.793 --> 21:06.694
'Cause after I borrow a dress
and some lipstick...

21:06.763 --> 21:10.460
I am gonna have lunch
with my buddy Walter...

21:10.533 --> 21:12.467
and you are gonna teach me...

21:12.535 --> 21:16.528
everything I always wanted to know
about women but was afraid to ask.

22:45.895 --> 22:48.295
How ya doin', Walter?

22:48.364 --> 22:50.992
- Amanda?
- In the flesh.

22:51.067 --> 22:53.797
And what about that flesh?

22:53.870 --> 22:56.338
Jesus Christ.

22:56.406 --> 22:59.773
Susie, I'll have
a margarita, please.

22:59.843 --> 23:02.539
So what do you think?
Did you get a good look at my legs?

23:05.115 --> 23:09.609
- So, Steve never mentioned me?
- No.

23:09.686 --> 23:11.881
Well, that's understandable.

23:11.955 --> 23:15.220
We only just discovered each other
a few days ago.

23:15.291 --> 23:18.556
I'm his half sister.
We have different mothers.

23:18.628 --> 23:23.895
He sure did talk about you
quite a bit.

23:23.967 --> 23:24.899
Really?

23:26.102 --> 23:27.933
Check out that ass.

23:28.004 --> 23:30.939
How'd you like to give her
a punch in the pants?

23:31.007 --> 23:32.770
You're not gay, are you?

23:34.777 --> 23:38.440
If I'm gay, Clint Eastwood
is a transvestite. Excuse me.

23:47.824 --> 23:50.258
You don't look like Steve,
except something...

23:51.327 --> 23:53.295
about the eyes that--

23:53.363 --> 23:56.127
But you sure do act like him.
You always drink margaritas?

23:56.199 --> 23:58.258
- Yeah.
- So does Steve.

23:58.334 --> 24:01.098
Well, here's to Steve,
wherever he may be.

24:01.171 --> 24:02.638
By the way, where is he?

24:03.506 --> 24:07.272
I don't know.
He just said that he was going away.

24:08.044 --> 24:11.036
- And he'd be gone for a long time.
- You're kidding me.

24:11.748 --> 24:15.809
- No. He kept talking about Gauguin.
- Who?

24:15.885 --> 24:18.251
Gauguin.
He was a French painter.

24:18.321 --> 24:23.657
He decided to chuck it all
and move to Tahiti to paint.

24:23.726 --> 24:26.286
He said he was
fed up with everything.

24:26.362 --> 24:28.296
And between you and me...

24:30.033 --> 24:31.796
he seemed very depressed.

24:31.868 --> 24:32.800
Depressed?

24:33.570 --> 24:36.664
Last night, three of his ex-girlfriends
were throwing him a dinner party.

24:36.739 --> 24:39.333
When he left me,
he couldn't have been happier.

24:39.409 --> 24:42.708
Maybe the party didn't turn out
exactly like he planned.

24:42.779 --> 24:44.713
Steve is not the kind of man...

24:44.781 --> 24:47.944
who would suddenly decide
to chuck it all and not tell me.

24:49.085 --> 24:52.248
- Did you check his office?
- For what?

24:52.322 --> 24:54.858
I don't know.
Maybe he left you a note.

24:58.094 --> 25:01.552
- You heard anything?
- No. It's very strange.

25:01.631 --> 25:03.963
Beth, this is Amanda Brooks,
Steve's sister.

25:04.033 --> 25:06.194
- How're you doing?
- Mind if I look in his office?

25:06.269 --> 25:09.204
- Maybe he left a note.
- Go ahead.

25:09.272 --> 25:12.708
But when I cleaned up his desk,
I didn't find anything.

25:15.478 --> 25:18.106
- You're his sister, huh?
- Half sister.

25:18.181 --> 25:20.911
We only just discovered each other
a few days ago.

25:20.984 --> 25:24.442
Oh, 'cause I've been his secretary
for two years...

25:24.520 --> 25:26.454
and he never said anything--

25:26.522 --> 25:29.491
- Nothing.
- Did you look in the drawer?

25:29.559 --> 25:31.857
- Yeah.
- Let me have a look.

25:31.928 --> 25:34.863
He told Amanda he was gonna chuck it all
and be like Gauguin.

25:36.366 --> 25:38.027
The painter?

25:38.101 --> 25:41.502
- I can't believe he wouldn't call me.
- What's this?

25:41.571 --> 25:43.937
- What?
- It's a note. Says "To Walter."

25:44.007 --> 25:46.498
- Where'd you find that?
- In the drawer.

25:46.576 --> 25:48.510
I looked--

25:48.578 --> 25:51.775
"Dear, Walter.
I'm fed up with my life.

25:51.848 --> 25:55.875
I've decided to chuck it all
and start again like Gauguin.

25:55.952 --> 25:58.921
I asked Amanda, my half sister,
to stay in my apartment while I'm gone.

25:58.988 --> 26:02.185
Take her to lunch. You'll like her.
She's got a great pair of--

26:03.660 --> 26:05.594
So long. Steve."

26:07.163 --> 26:09.131
- Was that his handwriting?
- Yeah.

26:21.744 --> 26:24.338
What's the matter?

26:24.414 --> 26:26.439
He's really gone.

26:26.516 --> 26:28.450
Yeah, it looks that way, sugar.

26:30.687 --> 26:34.123
He always called me that.

26:35.425 --> 26:38.258
You must have been
really crazy about him.

26:43.099 --> 26:45.966
I hated him. I just--

26:46.035 --> 26:50.233
I always cry when I'm
really, really happy.

26:50.306 --> 26:52.638
Sorry. Excuse me.

26:55.745 --> 26:57.975
I'm sorry, Mr. Freidkin.

27:04.287 --> 27:06.812
Mr. Freidkin,
we just found this.

27:09.192 --> 27:12.719
- Steve's sister.
- Half sister.

27:14.864 --> 27:16.297
Our Steve?

27:17.633 --> 27:19.567
Why, that son of a gun.

27:19.635 --> 27:22.263
He didn't know about her
until a couple of days ago.

27:23.873 --> 27:25.807
Talk about your family secrets.

27:27.110 --> 27:29.510
You should read the note.

27:29.579 --> 27:31.012
What note?

27:43.092 --> 27:45.959
- This is a joke, right?
- No, he's gone.

27:47.130 --> 27:50.588
- I don't believe it.
- You must be Arnold, Steve's boss.

27:50.666 --> 27:53.601
- How you doing, Arnold?
- Yes.

27:53.669 --> 27:56.467
Steve told me a lot about you.

27:56.539 --> 27:59.997
Well, not all bad, I hope.

28:00.076 --> 28:02.306
No, not all of it.

28:02.378 --> 28:06.439
We're gonna miss him.
He was one hell of an advertising man.

28:06.516 --> 28:09.713
He was that, yeah, but...

28:09.786 --> 28:11.720
I think he can be improved on.

28:12.822 --> 28:15.222
Oh, really? How's that?

28:17.126 --> 28:19.788
Why don't you take me to your office.
I'll tell you. How's that?

28:25.034 --> 28:27.366
You're sure I can't
get you something stronger?

28:27.437 --> 28:30.770
No, thanks. Except for
the occasional margarita at lunch...

28:30.840 --> 28:32.967
I make it a habit
not to drink on the job.

28:35.678 --> 28:37.612
You sound like your brother.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.947
- Who do you work for?
- You, I hope.

28:45.788 --> 28:48.222
I'm flattered.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.555
Have you had experience
in advertising?

28:50.626 --> 28:53.390
Hire me and I'll get you
the Faxton account.

28:58.234 --> 29:00.429
Get me the Faxton account
and you're hired.

29:01.671 --> 29:06.734
Hire me, I won't tell you wife
about apartment "J" on West 57th Street.

29:08.611 --> 29:10.442
My God.

29:10.513 --> 29:13.038
What else did Steve tell you?

29:14.951 --> 29:18.717
He told me you pay him 200 a year,
plus fringes. I'll take 250.

29:19.489 --> 29:22.253
Why should I pay you more
than Steve's getting?

29:22.959 --> 29:24.893
Steve didn't give you a hard-on.

29:34.537 --> 29:35.868
Denise.

29:37.440 --> 29:40.603
You knew Steve Brooks
pretty well, didn't ya?

29:40.676 --> 29:43.076
- "Knew"?
- Well, know.

29:43.146 --> 29:45.080
- Pretty well.
- So tell me.

29:45.148 --> 29:49.983
What adjective would you say
best describes him?

29:50.052 --> 29:51.485
Asshole.

29:53.089 --> 29:56.024
That could also be a noun.

29:56.092 --> 29:58.083
Major asshole.

29:59.428 --> 30:00.759
Sounds great.
When do you start?

30:00.830 --> 30:03.458
Tomorrow morning.
What can I say?

30:03.533 --> 30:05.933
- How about you show me the ropes?
- Sure.

30:07.537 --> 30:09.402
Goddamn Italian shoes.

30:11.140 --> 30:15.201
Yeah, well. It's gonna really be
great working with you. Steve and all.

30:15.278 --> 30:18.543
- Why don't we have dinner tonight?
- Yeah.

30:18.614 --> 30:21.811
How about a little sushi
at Aiko's.

30:21.884 --> 30:24.648
8:00. Couple ofbeers at Duke's.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.779
- Okay.
- Great.

30:26.856 --> 30:29.693
See you later, bud.

30:29.826 --> 30:30.952
Well--

30:32.128 --> 30:34.062
Let's see which one
of your guides...

30:34.130 --> 30:37.361
is available
to give us some answers.

30:54.384 --> 30:55.316
Jesus.

31:09.833 --> 31:11.391
Greetings, sahib.

31:11.468 --> 31:14.801
Multiple blessings
from the eternal spirit.

31:15.638 --> 31:16.798
It's Pasha.

31:19.776 --> 31:22.836
Pasha, is it appropriate
that we speak?

31:26.583 --> 31:28.517
Exceedingly so, sahib.

31:30.253 --> 31:32.483
The answer to your question is...

31:32.555 --> 31:35.854
in order for Sahib Brooks
to be...

31:35.925 --> 31:39.486
reincarnated, he must
first be dead.

31:39.562 --> 31:40.494
He's dead.

31:42.165 --> 31:43.393
He is?

31:44.467 --> 31:48.665
Well, isn't he? I mean, you're
supposed to know about those things.

31:51.007 --> 31:55.068
If, indeed, Sahib Brooks'...

31:55.145 --> 31:58.171
immortal soul has left
the bondage of this earth...

31:58.248 --> 32:01.012
it is reasonable to assume...

32:01.084 --> 32:05.020
it has not yet arrived
at its predestined spiritual abode...

32:05.088 --> 32:07.579
or of course I would know of it.

32:07.657 --> 32:09.887
Okay. Let's say that he is dead...

32:09.959 --> 32:12.291
and he has been reincarnated
as a woman.

32:12.362 --> 32:15.160
- You see, the eternal soul--
- Let me finish!

32:17.901 --> 32:18.890
Sorry, Pasha.

32:21.905 --> 32:24.931
Could it still be the same man
in a different body?

32:25.008 --> 32:28.375
Although the grand design
provides for...

32:28.444 --> 32:31.709
almost any possibility...

32:31.781 --> 32:36.241
I have never heard of such a case
as you speak of.

32:36.319 --> 32:40.983
But I will investigate and report
to you the next time we communicate.

32:41.057 --> 32:43.821
In the meantime,
peace be with you...

32:43.893 --> 32:46.555
and Brahma, the supreme soul...

32:46.629 --> 32:49.723
the essence of the universe...

32:49.799 --> 32:51.733
guide and protect you.

33:00.743 --> 33:03.075
That really takes it out of me.

33:04.747 --> 33:07.978
Pasha wasn't much fucking help.

33:10.253 --> 33:12.847
Aside from the fact that this....

33:12.922 --> 33:16.414
woman claims to be
the late Mr. Brooks...

33:16.492 --> 33:20.428
is there any other reason why you might
think that he would be dead?

33:20.496 --> 33:22.987
No, of course not!
What other reason could there be?

33:25.835 --> 33:28.167
You've reached 555-6731.

33:28.238 --> 33:30.399
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

33:31.674 --> 33:34.541
Hello, Kurt,
you ps ychic, ps ycho fag.

33:34.611 --> 33:38.172
Margo, get your ass to Bloomingdale's.
I'll meet you in an hour.

33:54.030 --> 33:56.123
Oh, yeah, that's pretty.

33:56.199 --> 33:58.929
Where are you going?

33:59.002 --> 34:01.300
I'm going to Aiko's.

34:01.371 --> 34:04.807
Don't you think something
a little less formal for sushi?

34:04.874 --> 34:08.105
Yeah, probably, but maybe
we should get it anyway.

34:08.177 --> 34:10.771
Bound to be other nights
when I can wear it.

34:10.847 --> 34:12.781
Oh, bound to be.

34:14.150 --> 34:16.914
You think I'd look good
in something like that?

34:19.188 --> 34:21.156
There's not much
you wouldn't look good in.

34:21.224 --> 34:24.751
I bet you say that to all the boys
who become girls.

34:26.496 --> 34:28.429
You need a bra.

34:28.498 --> 34:31.433
We're about the same size?
34-C, right?

34:35.304 --> 34:37.500
Oh, yeah. I think we--

34:42.645 --> 34:45.239
- Cash or charge?
- What's the total?

34:46.815 --> 34:49.250
Including cosmetics,
perfume and jewelry...

34:49.319 --> 34:53.119
it's $41,61 1.89.

34:54.891 --> 34:56.949
How you wanna
pay for that, slick?

35:00.396 --> 35:02.261
She never lets me pay for a thing.

35:02.332 --> 35:05.130
If I tried, she'd probably shoot me,
dump me in the river.

35:15.445 --> 35:18.642
Do you know how many poor animals
they had to kill to make that coat?

35:18.715 --> 35:21.343
Do you know how many rich animals
I had to fuck to get this coat?

35:31.227 --> 35:33.161
Here she comes.

35:37.700 --> 35:40.533
Excuse me.
Miss Brooks, is it?

35:40.603 --> 35:43.265
I'm Stuart Higgins,
the apartment manager.

35:44.574 --> 35:46.599
Nice to meet you.
Do me a favor, Al.

35:46.676 --> 35:48.940
I'm expecting a big delivery
from Bloomingdale's.

35:49.012 --> 35:52.345
Would you send it up?
I got a hot date tonight.

35:52.415 --> 35:55.976
I'm sorry, but I can't allow you
to stay in Mr. Brooks' apartment...

35:56.052 --> 35:59.385
unless you can prove
you really are his sister.

35:59.455 --> 36:02.720
- Do you have some identification?
- Like what?

36:02.792 --> 36:06.284
- A driver's license?
- I don't drive.

36:06.362 --> 36:09.456
- Credit cards?
- I don't charge.

36:09.532 --> 36:11.500
You told Mac the night guard...

36:11.567 --> 36:13.865
that your brother
told Al the day guard...

36:13.936 --> 36:16.268
that you'd be staying
in your brother's apartment.

36:16.339 --> 36:18.136
- Yeah.
- Well...

36:18.207 --> 36:22.166
this is Al, and he doesn't remember
your brother saying that.

36:22.245 --> 36:25.214
- You don't remember that, Al?
- No, ma'am.

36:25.281 --> 36:27.215
- How old are you?
- Forty-nine.

36:27.283 --> 36:30.116
You told me you were 50.
Don't you remember?

36:30.186 --> 36:34.145
The day my brother introduced us,
you said you just had a birthday.

36:34.223 --> 36:37.351
- I met you?
- Yeah, I told you how young you looked.

36:38.828 --> 36:41.058
Could start that early.
It could.

36:41.130 --> 36:43.121
It's probably nothing serious,
just short-term...

36:43.199 --> 36:45.690
but if I were you,
I'd get it checked.

36:45.768 --> 36:50.330
You can call Arnold Freidkin.
He's my boss at F&B.

36:50.406 --> 36:53.705
If that doesn't satisfy you,
call Laura Patrick.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.505
- Who?
- Laura Patrick.

36:55.578 --> 36:59.981
Redhead my brother fixed you up with
when your wife was out of town.

37:01.217 --> 37:05.755
You should get checked too.
You're getting just as forgetful as Al.

37:07.323 --> 37:09.257
Check out the headlights
on the blonde.

37:09.325 --> 37:12.692
How'd you like to play "hide
the salami" with that for about a week?

37:13.896 --> 37:15.921
Not me. You.

37:16.999 --> 37:19.729
You don't think that's
a perfectly legitimate question?

37:19.802 --> 37:21.394
Coming from a guy, maybe.

37:21.470 --> 37:25.270
You don't think
women talk to women that way?

37:25.341 --> 37:28.572
Yeah, I guess so.
Sometimes. Some women.

37:28.644 --> 37:31.272
So what's wrong with a woman
talking to a man that way?

37:31.347 --> 37:34.874
I don't know. I just think that
when a man talks to a woman...

37:34.950 --> 37:36.918
or a woman talks to a man...

37:36.986 --> 37:39.181
it should be more romantic.

37:39.255 --> 37:43.419
So women aren't supposed to feel or talk
about the same things a man feels?

37:43.492 --> 37:46.393
It's okay for a man to say
"I'm horny. I'd like to get laid."

37:46.462 --> 37:49.590
- This is not okay for a woman to say?
- You sound like Gloria Steinem.

37:53.102 --> 37:55.036
Let's go to Duke's.

37:57.706 --> 38:00.174
- Steve told you about Duke's?
- Yeah.

38:02.711 --> 38:05.009
I used to put your brother to bed
after six of these.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.310
- Yeah? How many is this?
- Five.

38:07.383 --> 38:10.375
Good. I got one to go.

38:10.452 --> 38:12.386
Nope. That's a double.

38:13.455 --> 38:16.015
Then I'll just sip it.

38:16.091 --> 38:18.025
I was afraid of that.

38:21.497 --> 38:23.590
- I really miss him.
- Who? Duke?

38:23.666 --> 38:25.600
No. Steve.

38:25.668 --> 38:28.466
Why? I mean, face it.

38:30.105 --> 38:33.268
He wasn't the nicest guy
in the world.

38:33.342 --> 38:35.970
Especially where women
are concerned.

38:36.979 --> 38:39.413
He loves kids, though.
And dogs.

38:43.018 --> 38:44.986
And he does things for people
nobody knows about...

38:45.054 --> 38:48.421
except for me and the shrink he was
seeing for about six months.

38:49.158 --> 38:50.090
And God.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.862
- Yeah. He knows.
- She.

38:57.466 --> 38:58.933
He's like Popeye.

39:00.035 --> 39:02.162
- God?
- No. Steve. You know.

39:02.238 --> 39:05.469
"I am what I am."
He is what he is.

39:05.541 --> 39:07.634
He's a smart, funny, charming...

39:08.377 --> 39:11.642
dyed-in-the-wool
male chauvinist...

39:11.714 --> 39:16.048
who brags about most things other guys
are afraid to admit to themselves.

39:16.118 --> 39:19.679
And you know what?
He likes me.

39:19.755 --> 39:22.019
He's very loyal.

39:22.091 --> 39:24.025
You wanna know why, Walter?

39:25.861 --> 39:28.227
Why?

39:28.297 --> 39:30.231
Because he envies you.

39:30.299 --> 39:33.791
See, you're a good guy.

39:33.869 --> 39:36.099
How do you know that?

39:36.171 --> 39:38.799
- That you're a good guy?
- No, that he envies me.

39:38.874 --> 39:40.466
Oh. Well.

39:42.311 --> 39:45.542
He told me.
He said, "Amanda...

39:45.614 --> 39:47.377
you stick with Walt.

39:47.449 --> 39:50.077
He's a good guy."

39:50.152 --> 39:53.144
- Maybe I'm not so good.
- How come?

39:55.824 --> 39:57.314
To tell you the truth...

39:57.393 --> 40:00.157
I really, really
wanna go to bed with you.

40:01.230 --> 40:03.221
Like that's a hot news flash.

40:03.299 --> 40:05.893
I can't because you're
my best friend's sister.

40:05.968 --> 40:09.131
What do you mean? Steve wouldn't have
trouble going to bed with your sister.

40:09.204 --> 40:12.196
I don't have a sister.
Even if I did, I don't think he would.

40:12.274 --> 40:15.573
Oh, he would.
Take my word for it.

40:15.644 --> 40:18.306
So what are you saying?
That I should?

40:18.380 --> 40:20.405
I mean, if I could--

40:20.482 --> 40:22.609
If you could, yeah, sure.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.187
- But you can't.
- No?

40:26.255 --> 40:27.779
No. Sorry.

40:29.258 --> 40:31.192
You mind telling me why?

40:36.598 --> 40:39.032
'Cause I'm not really
who you think I am.

40:42.137 --> 40:44.071
It's me, Walt--
Steve.

40:45.641 --> 40:47.370
I died, and...

40:47.443 --> 40:50.173
God wouldn't
let me into heaven...

40:50.245 --> 40:54.477
'cause I been such a shit
to women.

40:55.985 --> 40:58.545
That's why? God.

40:58.620 --> 41:00.554
If I want to go to heaven...

41:00.622 --> 41:02.647
I gotta find--

41:04.860 --> 41:07.260
I gotta find one female
who likes me.

41:07.329 --> 41:09.559
That's not gonna be easy.

41:11.166 --> 41:14.397
- Hey. You believe I'm Steve?
- Yeah. Sure.

41:15.704 --> 41:17.695
I knew you would.

41:17.773 --> 41:19.900
- Hey, Steve.
- What?

41:19.975 --> 41:22.068
I'd still like
to fuck your sister.

41:22.144 --> 41:25.807
- She is not Steve!
- You didn't look in her e yes.

41:25.881 --> 41:28.213
She didn't kiss you,
for Christ's sake.

41:29.418 --> 41:31.352
- Give me that.
- Spooky.

41:31.420 --> 41:33.980
It's bullshit, darling.

41:34.056 --> 41:37.048
You're a sucker for that kind of thing.
That's why she chose you.

41:37.126 --> 41:39.060
How does she know about everything?

41:39.128 --> 41:42.291
You can laugh, but I get the feeling
she's watching us right now.

41:52.508 --> 41:53.634
Hello?

41:53.709 --> 41:57.543
You're a major stockholder
with Faxton Cosmetics.

41:57.613 --> 42:01.777
I want an appointment
with Sheila Faxton tomorrow afternoon.

42:01.850 --> 42:03.715
You sound drunk.

42:04.453 --> 42:06.717
You sound stoned.

42:06.789 --> 42:10.316
Three of you getting high, trying
to figure out what to do about me?

42:15.431 --> 42:17.729
- Was that--
- Steve.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.961
- You mean Amanda.
- No, I mean Steve!

42:23.839 --> 42:24.999
Coffee.

42:34.283 --> 42:36.808
Where is my address book?

42:36.885 --> 42:40.013
- Your address book?
- Steve's address book.

42:40.089 --> 42:42.819
- Oh. Bottom drawer.
- No, I looked there.

42:47.896 --> 42:50.091
Guess I can't think
with all this hair.

42:50.165 --> 42:52.099
You have beautiful hair.

42:52.167 --> 42:55.136
You know how long it takes
to dry? Get me my barber.

42:55.204 --> 42:57.934
Your barber?

42:58.006 --> 42:59.940
I don't have a barber.
My hairdresser.

43:00.008 --> 43:03.341
In fact, who does your hair?
It's nice. It's all off your face.

43:03.412 --> 43:05.505
Sergei, actually.

43:05.581 --> 43:08.482
Sergei, good.
Get me an appointment with Sergei.

43:10.419 --> 43:12.614
Go, go, go!

43:12.688 --> 43:14.622
Media.
How may I direct your call?

43:14.690 --> 43:18.023
Hello. A Miss Darlene Wooster,
please.

43:18.093 --> 43:19.720
One moment, please.

43:19.795 --> 43:22.025
- This is Darlene.
- Darlene.

43:22.097 --> 43:27.763
I'm writing a book called
Great Names In Advertising.

43:28.203 --> 43:30.763
Steven Brooks gave you
as a recommendation.

43:30.839 --> 43:34.536
I was wondering if you could
tell me about him.

43:34.610 --> 43:37.101
I don't believe that asshole
gave you my number!

43:40.249 --> 43:42.342
Didn't think
you were so hot, either.

44:02.838 --> 44:03.770
Morning.

44:06.175 --> 44:07.608
What's up?

44:07.676 --> 44:10.406
You said you wanted me
to show you the ropes, so--

44:10.479 --> 44:13.312
Oh, yeah. Right.

44:20.923 --> 44:23.721
- You look like shit, pal.
- You don't look too good yourself.

44:23.792 --> 44:25.851
You all right?
You're red.

44:25.928 --> 44:29.193
- Got a fever or somethin'?
- Probably too much rouge.

44:29.264 --> 44:31.198
Gotta be a fuckin' Rembrandt
to put on makeup.

44:34.603 --> 44:36.537
Put your chin up.
There you go. That's good.

44:42.511 --> 44:44.274
Remember when
I thought you were Connie?

44:47.049 --> 44:48.710
That's Connie.

44:48.784 --> 44:50.376
Good. All right.
Let's take a break.

44:53.222 --> 44:55.713
I think I need salt
'cause I keep crampin' up.

44:55.791 --> 44:58.851
- Okay, turn the music down.
- Hi.

44:58.927 --> 45:02.454
Hi. I'm Amanda Brooks.
I'm Steve's sister.

45:02.531 --> 45:04.624
He never told me
he had a sister.

45:04.700 --> 45:06.930
I'm his half sister.

45:07.002 --> 45:09.493
Hello, Walter. He never told me
he had a half a sister.

45:09.571 --> 45:12.870
- Have you seen him lately?
- Haven't heard from him in three days.

45:12.941 --> 45:15.637
I'm afraid he's disappeared.

45:15.711 --> 45:17.736
Where?

45:17.813 --> 45:20.748
We don't know.
He just...

45:20.816 --> 45:22.943
said he went someplace
to start again.

45:23.018 --> 45:25.179
- Start what?
- His life.

45:25.254 --> 45:27.313
- Like Gauguin.
- Who?

45:28.490 --> 45:30.685
Gauguin, Connie, is a painter...

45:30.759 --> 45:33.785
who gave everything up
and moved to Tahiti.

45:33.862 --> 45:36.298
I thought you said
you didn't know where he went.

45:36.298 --> 45:36.320
I thought you said
you didn't know where he went.

45:37.198 --> 45:40.190
Right. So I guess you're
really gonna miss him.

45:40.268 --> 45:42.793
Yeah, I guess.

45:42.871 --> 45:45.863
- You liked him a lot, didn't you?
- Sure.

45:52.914 --> 45:55.940
- You're lying.
- No, I like him okay.

45:56.017 --> 45:59.180
You're just saying that because
I'm his sister. Tell me the truth.

45:59.254 --> 46:01.347
He's a putz. Sorry.

46:01.423 --> 46:02.549
You slept with him.

46:02.624 --> 46:05.286
Sure, and here I am
on the cover of Dream.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.294
I'm the Dream girl
for November.

46:07.362 --> 46:09.956
- Connie, get changed.
- Yeah.

46:10.031 --> 46:11.965
Nice meeting ya.

46:12.033 --> 46:16.163
You know, you're gorgeous. You oughta
be a Dream girl for December.

46:16.237 --> 46:18.171
- See ya.
- Bye.

46:21.009 --> 46:24.069
If there are some of you who may not
have read my memo yesterday...

46:24.145 --> 46:26.807
F&B has added
two new additions...

46:26.881 --> 46:29.748
to its growing family.

46:29.818 --> 46:31.752
Miss Amanda Brooks...

46:31.820 --> 46:33.913
whose pretty feet...

46:33.988 --> 46:38.357
will be filling her brother's
prematurely-departed shoes.

46:42.063 --> 46:45.430
And Mr. Dan Jones,
recruited from our West Coast office.

46:48.436 --> 46:50.404
All right.
Let's do some brainstorming.

46:50.472 --> 46:52.565
Who wants to get the ball rolling?

46:52.640 --> 46:56.337
The Mama Weiss commercial
has been very successful.

46:56.411 --> 46:59.437
You know,
that was your brother's account.

47:00.949 --> 47:03.440
I have an idea that
might be just as good--

47:03.518 --> 47:05.452
maybe even better--
for Haycrest Foods.

47:06.955 --> 47:09.423
Home movies. Probably Dad...

47:09.491 --> 47:12.255
photographing the family
doing family things.

47:12.327 --> 47:14.727
Kids washing the car
on Sunday morning...

47:14.796 --> 47:16.957
squirting each other
with the hose.

47:17.031 --> 47:21.229
Mom caught in her curlers
picking up the morning papers.

47:21.302 --> 47:24.635
Family dog taking a little nap.

47:24.706 --> 47:28.267
Mom serving up some pancakes
to the kids for breakfast.

47:28.343 --> 47:32.473
Kids fighting over the bottle
of Haycrest maple syrup...

47:32.547 --> 47:35.812
which falls, bounces
but does not break.

47:35.884 --> 47:39.581
Amateur-style home movies,
professional message.

47:39.654 --> 47:43.181
Excuse me. I'm sorry
to interrupt...

47:43.258 --> 47:45.783
but did you discuss this idea
with Steve?

47:46.628 --> 47:47.617
No. Why?

47:47.695 --> 47:51.893
Well, I'm a little embarrassed
to bring this up...

47:51.966 --> 47:54.400
but I was taking some home movies
the other day...

47:54.469 --> 47:57.438
and I came up with almost exactly
the same concept.

47:57.505 --> 47:58.472
Really?

47:58.540 --> 48:00.906
I called Steve immediately
and told him about it.

48:03.812 --> 48:07.976
I don't know what to say.
I feel very foolish.

48:08.049 --> 48:11.541
Oh, you shouldn't. Always remember
that in this company...

48:11.619 --> 48:15.385
it's not authorship that counts,
it's teamwork.

48:24.065 --> 48:26.295
Mr. Edmonds can see you now.
This way.

48:41.516 --> 48:44.542
I was just thinking.
Since we're both new here...

48:44.619 --> 48:46.985
how about joining forces?

48:47.055 --> 48:49.819
- Have dinner, talk it over.
- Great idea.

48:49.891 --> 48:51.825
- Get to know each other.
- Yeah.

48:51.893 --> 48:54.384
Let me save you
some time and trouble, Dan.

48:54.462 --> 48:57.989
I know all about you.
Your reputation has preceded you.

48:58.066 --> 49:01.866
Don't tell me you're one of those women
who believes everything she hears?

49:01.936 --> 49:04.427
Even if your reputation
hadn't preceded you...

49:04.506 --> 49:06.474
I'd still know all about you.

49:06.541 --> 49:09.271
Is that suede?

49:09.344 --> 49:11.676
You're a pretty smart,
good-looking...

49:11.746 --> 49:13.680
sexual deviate...

49:13.748 --> 49:16.808
who has to score in order to prove
he's not inadequate.

49:16.885 --> 49:18.978
Sounds like you've
made this speech before.

49:19.053 --> 49:21.920
Don't get me wrong. Some of
my best friends are deviates.

49:21.990 --> 49:25.482
But save yourself an expensive meal,
whatever's left of your ego...

49:25.560 --> 49:28.085
because there is no way in hell...

49:28.162 --> 49:31.063
you are ever gonna
get me into the sack.

49:31.132 --> 49:33.965
And switch aftershaves.
You smell like a salad.

49:39.040 --> 49:41.065
I think I'll call you Amanda.

49:41.142 --> 49:43.474
Since you know
about the apartment...

49:43.545 --> 49:46.480
why don't you let me
give you a personal tour?

49:46.548 --> 49:50.177
It's stocked with champagne,
and it has a great view of the park.

49:50.251 --> 49:52.481
No, thanks.
I'm allergic to grapes...

49:52.554 --> 49:56.957
and corporate executives who take credit
for other people's ideas.

49:57.025 --> 50:00.085
- You're not suggesting--
- I'm not suggesting anything.

50:00.161 --> 50:02.755
You and I both know
you never called Steve.

50:03.998 --> 50:06.091
Even if you're right,
and you aren't...

50:06.167 --> 50:09.659
don't you think that's dangerous talk
for a corporate employee?

50:09.737 --> 50:14.572
- I think I can afford it.
- Really? What makes you think so?

50:14.642 --> 50:17.805
I have a 2:00 appointment
with Sheila Faxton.

50:17.879 --> 50:20.473
Still interested
in the Faxton account, Arnold?

50:21.783 --> 50:24.377
- Yes.
- I thought so.

50:52.447 --> 50:55.575
- You got a problem, pal?
- Yeah.

50:55.650 --> 50:58.380
If you don't kiss me,
I'm gonna be sick.

50:58.453 --> 51:00.387
Then I think
we both got a problem...

51:00.455 --> 51:03.253
because if I do kiss you,
I'm gonna be sick.

51:05.860 --> 51:07.794
Have a nice day.

51:09.497 --> 51:12.830
- Miss Brooks is here to see you.
- All right. Send her in.

51:12.900 --> 51:14.561
Go on in.

51:51.205 --> 51:53.799
Thank you for taking the time
to see me, Miss Faxton.

51:53.875 --> 51:55.274
You're welcome.

51:55.343 --> 51:58.744
If Margo wasn't
a majority stockholder in Faxton...

51:58.813 --> 52:00.940
you wouldn't have made it
past the front door.

52:01.015 --> 52:03.643
Now that you're here,
what can I do foryou?

52:03.718 --> 52:05.549
You've got five minutes.

52:06.421 --> 52:08.514
Okay, I'll get
right to the point.

52:08.589 --> 52:11.956
I work for Freidkin & Booth,
and...

52:13.728 --> 52:16.094
we'd like to represent
Faxton Cosmetics.

52:17.532 --> 52:20.729
Horton & Benson represent Faxton.
Why should I change?

52:22.036 --> 52:26.063
Because we're new-fashioned.
Our people are younger and brighter.

52:26.140 --> 52:28.506
And I go with the deal.

52:29.510 --> 52:33.071
Exactly what does that mean,
Miss Brooks?

52:34.882 --> 52:38.784
If you wanna find out, it's gonna take
a lot longer than five minutes.

52:43.257 --> 52:44.349
Okay.

52:45.626 --> 52:49.289
I'm having a party this evening,
a few special friends.

52:50.698 --> 52:52.689
Kelly will give you the address.

52:53.835 --> 52:55.769
Good. Oh, what time?

52:56.771 --> 52:58.068
8:30.

52:59.640 --> 53:01.039
Sharp.

53:02.210 --> 53:06.081
Great.
Oh, what'll I wear?

53:06.081 --> 53:06.103
Great.
Oh, what'll I wear?

53:07.615 --> 53:09.048
Whateveryou like.

53:10.318 --> 53:12.650
I'll be there.

53:12.720 --> 53:14.984
With bells on.

53:17.225 --> 53:19.352
8:00 in New York City.
This is Kid Kelly.

53:19.427 --> 53:21.861
Here's "Are You Listening, Luck y"
by Joe Ely.

53:25.633 --> 53:28.693
Do you believe this body?
I'll never get used to this.

53:28.770 --> 53:31.671
Be careful of Sheila.
She can be dangerous.

53:31.739 --> 53:35.436
Do I detect a note of authentic concern
over my future welfare?

53:35.510 --> 53:39.606
No, but these days my welfare
seems to depend on yours.

53:39.681 --> 53:42.241
Kathleen Seymour lived with Sheila
for ten years.

53:42.317 --> 53:46.310
She developed this fragrance for Faxton
and she always wore it.

53:46.387 --> 53:48.548
Yeah? What happened to her?

53:48.623 --> 53:52.024
She eloped with a French architect.
Sheila never got over it.

53:52.093 --> 53:54.027
You think it prudent
to remind her?

53:54.095 --> 53:56.893
Knowing Sheila, I think
it ought to just do the trick.

53:59.501 --> 54:01.435
Give it a whirl.

54:02.537 --> 54:04.402
- Nice touch.
- Thanks.

54:04.472 --> 54:08.135
- What the hell is this?
- It's a body suit.

54:08.209 --> 54:10.404
You've taken a million of them
off women.

54:10.478 --> 54:13.276
I used to hate these things.
Shit.

54:13.348 --> 54:15.680
Snap crotch.
Step into it.

54:15.750 --> 54:18.844
- "Step into it."
- No, no. That's very fragile.

54:21.289 --> 54:24.281
- Snap--
- "Snap crotch. Step into it."

54:43.912 --> 54:46.972
- How're you doin'?
- Good, thanks. How are you?

55:08.503 --> 55:10.437
Oh, boy.

55:17.212 --> 55:20.477
- Hi. How you doing? Nice party.
- Wow.

55:25.320 --> 55:27.686
- Hello.
- Hello, Sheila.

55:29.624 --> 55:32.650
- What's that you're wearing?
- I don't know.

55:32.727 --> 55:34.388
A little something I pulled
out of the closet.

55:34.462 --> 55:37.829
- Not really sure who designed it.
- I mean the perfume.

55:37.932 --> 55:40.730
Oh, well, that's yours.

55:40.802 --> 55:43.100
- You make it. It's called--
- Yeah.

55:43.171 --> 55:44.900
I know what it's called.

55:47.508 --> 55:50.500
Come on. I'll introduce you
to some friends.

55:50.578 --> 55:51.510
Great.

55:55.450 --> 55:59.011
- So, you don't like the perfume?
- I love it.

55:59.087 --> 56:01.885
It just makes me
a little sad sometimes.

56:01.956 --> 56:04.288
And a little angry.

56:04.359 --> 56:07.920
When we get to know each other
a little better...

56:07.996 --> 56:10.328
I'll tell you all about it.

56:10.398 --> 56:11.330
Great.

56:15.303 --> 56:18.363
- Willy, Amanda.
- How're you doing, Will?

56:19.440 --> 56:24.002
Oh, bo y, you were right, Margo.
That Sheila can be dangerous.

56:24.078 --> 56:26.569
Afterthe party, we went
up to her bedroom.

56:26.648 --> 56:29.378
We killed a magnum of champagne
in nothing flat.

56:29.450 --> 56:33.511
We did about ten minutes on the merits
ofgood advertising and safe sex.

56:33.588 --> 56:36.386
Then we started
to undress each other.

56:36.457 --> 56:38.425
- I'll do it.
- Thanks.

56:47.602 --> 56:52.938
You know, I'll just put these
in my purse, okay? Excuse me.

56:54.309 --> 56:58.177
You know, I was seriously looking
forward to what I fantasized...

56:58.246 --> 57:02.273
was gonna be a truly unique
sexual experience for me.

57:02.350 --> 57:03.977
But it wasn 't
turning out that wa y.

57:04.052 --> 57:06.418
Something was definitely
out of sync.

57:06.487 --> 57:08.785
So I said to m yself,
"Steve, baby, come on.

57:08.856 --> 57:11.051
You may be a gorgeous female
on the outside...

57:11.125 --> 57:13.992
but inside,
you're still 1 00% male.

57:14.062 --> 57:17.998
And Sheila isjust another
rich, horny broad looking to get laid.

57:18.066 --> 57:20.534
So go for it.
What's the big deal here?"

57:21.903 --> 57:25.168
- Zi pper.
- No, it's a bodysuit.

57:25.239 --> 57:27.799
It has one of those--
You know, those--

57:27.875 --> 57:30.343
Those snappy crotches.

57:30.411 --> 57:32.606
Unsnap it.

57:32.680 --> 57:34.614
Oh, yeah. Okay.

57:44.192 --> 57:47.423
It got very weird.
Suddenly, I felt--

57:47.495 --> 57:50.589
I felt like my panty hose
were strangling me.

57:50.665 --> 57:54.692
I got the shakes.
I couldn 't breathe.

57:54.769 --> 57:58.068
And then she started kissing me.
And I fainted.

57:59.874 --> 58:02.365
I am so goddamn confused.

58:02.443 --> 58:05.003
I feel like my brains
are being ripped apart.

58:06.848 --> 58:10.147
- Did you do any drugs?
- You know I never take drugs.

58:10.218 --> 58:12.846
That's right.
You never do. Did.

58:18.259 --> 58:19.317
Jesus Christ.

58:20.395 --> 58:23.330
- It really is you, isn't it, Steve?
- Yes! Yes!

58:23.398 --> 58:24.490
Okay.

58:31.072 --> 58:34.166
All right. You want me to tell you
why you couldn't handle it?

58:34.242 --> 58:36.836
Unless you'd like me
to jump off the fucking roof.

58:36.911 --> 58:39.072
- She's gay.
- No kidding.

58:39.147 --> 58:41.980
- And you are a macho, homophobic--
- Homophobic?

58:42.049 --> 58:45.917
Yes, and gay-- male or female--
scares the living hell out of you.

58:51.325 --> 58:54.089
- Where are you going?
- To jump off the fucking roof.

58:55.196 --> 58:56.629
I should be so lucky.

59:00.067 --> 59:02.001
Son of a bitch!

59:10.378 --> 59:11.970
Morning.

59:14.549 --> 59:17.017
- Amanda, morning.
- Morning.

59:17.084 --> 59:19.882
I understand you saw the layouts
for the Brewster Mills jobs, right?

59:19.954 --> 59:22.650
- Yeah, it sucks.
- Hey, it's only a rough draft.

59:22.723 --> 59:25.749
- Women buy these products, Dan.
- I think I'm aware of that.

59:25.827 --> 59:29.126
No, that's a man's concept
of what appeals to a woman.

59:29.197 --> 59:31.688
Well, all the women I showed it to
thought it looked terrific.

59:31.766 --> 59:34.963
What women? Your secretary?
The ladies in accounting?

59:35.036 --> 59:38.631
What are they gonna say to
Mr. California-suntan-vice-president?

59:38.706 --> 59:41.004
- Arnold thought it looked great.
- Oh, Arnold would.

59:41.075 --> 59:44.533
He's about as sensitive
to a woman's needs as Jack the Ripper.

59:44.612 --> 59:47.945
Hey, maybe you're right,
but why are you so pissed off?

59:48.015 --> 59:50.643
I'll tell ya why
I'm so pissed off, buddy boy.

59:50.718 --> 59:53.983
I'm sick and tired of being treated
like a piece of meat.

01:00:03.231 --> 01:00:05.324
- Hello?
- Morning.

01:00:06.067 --> 01:00:07.762
I called you twice.

01:00:07.835 --> 01:00:11.066
Yeah, I just got in.
So, tell me...

01:00:11.138 --> 01:00:15.541
have you thought any more about giving
Freidkin & Booth the Faxton account?

01:00:16.711 --> 01:00:20.272
Well, you're all business
this morning, aren't you?

01:00:20.348 --> 01:00:22.543
Well, it's very important to me.

01:00:22.617 --> 01:00:27.645
I'll give it some more thought, and when
I decide, I'll give you a call, okay?

01:00:30.224 --> 01:00:32.715
- Okay.
- B ye.

01:00:32.793 --> 01:00:34.454
- Sheila?
- Yes?

01:00:34.529 --> 01:00:38.829
- In the meantime--
- Yeah? In the meantime?

01:00:40.501 --> 01:00:44.164
In the meantime,
could we have dinner?

01:00:44.906 --> 01:00:45.998
Sure.

01:00:46.073 --> 01:00:48.541
We can have dinner at Sardi's.

01:00:48.609 --> 01:00:51.476
Sardi's? Couldn't we go somewhere
a little less public?

01:00:51.546 --> 01:00:53.514
Well, that's no fun.

01:00:53.581 --> 01:00:55.640
I want to show you off.

01:00:55.716 --> 01:00:58.219
I'll pick you up at 7:30.

01:00:58.352 --> 01:00:59.376
B ye.

01:01:08.562 --> 01:01:11.190
- Come on.
- Where we going?

01:01:11.265 --> 01:01:12.926
- We're going to the gym.
- Why?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.059
I'm gonna whip your ass.

01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:30.283
Okay. Game to 1 1?

01:01:32.953 --> 01:01:37.185
- I'll spot you two.
- Game to 1 1. You can shove your two.

01:01:47.801 --> 01:01:49.029
Ray.

01:01:50.304 --> 01:01:52.397
Don't get nervous.

01:02:00.114 --> 01:02:02.981
Come on, Walter. You're not gonna
let a girl beat you, are you?

01:02:22.236 --> 01:02:24.101
Shake hands with fate!

01:02:25.406 --> 01:02:27.636
Call the foul!
Call the stupid foul!

01:02:28.375 --> 01:02:30.070
- Come on!
- Tie score.

01:02:31.512 --> 01:02:33.503
Next basket wins.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.447
- Yes!
- Yeah!

01:02:41.522 --> 01:02:44.047
- Whoa! Bravo!
- Nice game.

01:02:44.124 --> 01:02:46.524
- Way to go.
- First time you beat me.

01:02:46.593 --> 01:02:48.720
What are you talking about?
I never played you before.

01:02:48.796 --> 01:02:51.196
Yeah, that's what I said.
First time you beat me.

01:02:51.265 --> 01:02:53.028
And the last time.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.092
Well, you played
pretty damn good for a girl.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:59.037
Don't be so fucking condescending,
Walter.

01:02:59.106 --> 01:03:01.506
I play pretty damn good for a man.

01:03:13.787 --> 01:03:15.379
Miss Faxton?

01:03:15.456 --> 01:03:17.822
- Bring me the wine list.
- Yes, of course.

01:03:17.891 --> 01:03:19.984
Unless you'd rather choose?

01:03:20.794 --> 01:03:22.785
Oh, no. It's your evening.

01:03:24.531 --> 01:03:26.999
You know,
I think we have a problem.

01:03:27.067 --> 01:03:29.194
What's that?

01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:31.999
No give-and-take.
We both want to be the aggressor.

01:03:33.107 --> 01:03:34.802
Somebody's gotta be the man, right?

01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:36.900
What are we gonna do about it?

01:03:39.012 --> 01:03:42.812
- Flip a coin.
- Ha, ha. I'm serious.

01:03:44.218 --> 01:03:47.312
You know,
if you were really serious...

01:03:47.388 --> 01:03:49.822
you wouldn't have taken me
to this place.

01:03:51.725 --> 01:03:53.420
Where would you
like me to take you?

01:04:02.102 --> 01:04:04.161
You come here often?

01:04:04.238 --> 01:04:06.604
I used to when I was a man.

01:04:08.275 --> 01:04:10.800
When was that?

01:04:10.878 --> 01:04:13.142
Not so long ago in another life.

01:04:13.947 --> 01:04:15.778
Did you like being a man?

01:04:15.849 --> 01:04:17.840
Oh, yeah.

01:04:21.488 --> 01:04:23.422
What's it like?

01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:25.883
Compared to what?

01:04:27.027 --> 01:04:28.858
Being a woman.

01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:34.128
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not--

01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:37.534
You know, being a woman...

01:04:37.604 --> 01:04:39.538
it's not half bad.

01:04:41.141 --> 01:04:43.769
It's being both
that is the bitch.

01:04:44.845 --> 01:04:46.779
I'll drink to that.

01:04:49.016 --> 01:04:51.780
- How you doing, ladies?
- Aw, fuck off.

01:04:51.852 --> 01:04:54.821
What a shame. Didn't your mother tell
you nice girls don't talk like that?

01:04:54.888 --> 01:04:57.948
Bet you don't talk like that,
doll face, huh?

01:04:58.759 --> 01:05:02.320
Only to assholes who don't pay attention
when they're told to fuck off.

01:05:02.396 --> 01:05:05.297
Oh, I should have guessed.
Which one likes to be the man, huh?

01:05:05.365 --> 01:05:07.595
Tonight it's my turn.

01:05:13.574 --> 01:05:16.338
You talk like a man.
You fight like one.

01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:19.208
Guess you really must have been one.

01:05:19.279 --> 01:05:20.769
Come on.

01:05:20.848 --> 01:05:24.841
Let me take you someplace
where you can be yourself.

01:05:24.918 --> 01:05:26.852
Wherever that is.

01:06:00.454 --> 01:06:02.388
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:06.550
Some place.

01:06:08.095 --> 01:06:10.029
Good evening, ladies.
May I take your order?

01:06:10.097 --> 01:06:12.292
- Two margaritas.
- Right away.

01:06:12.366 --> 01:06:15.460
- See? That wasn't so difficult?
- For who?

01:06:19.439 --> 01:06:22.602
You can tell Freidkin
he can have the Faxton account.

01:06:25.712 --> 01:06:27.646
Thanks, Sheila. Thanks.

01:06:28.982 --> 01:06:31.348
Wanna dance?

01:06:31.418 --> 01:06:33.283
Yeah. Sure.

01:06:34.354 --> 01:06:35.787
Sure.

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:46.224
- Who's gonna lead?
- You are.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.791
Okay.

01:06:48.869 --> 01:06:50.928
Geez. I forgot how to do this.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.401
This doesn't feel right.

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:59.474
- I can't.
- Then I will.

01:06:59.546 --> 01:07:01.571
I really wanna work this out.

01:07:01.648 --> 01:07:05.641
- Okay.
- I'm terribly attracted to you.

01:07:05.719 --> 01:07:07.152
Oh, God.

01:07:14.995 --> 01:07:17.486
Sheila, don't do this.

01:07:19.833 --> 01:07:23.496
It's not that easy. You'll have to
give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

01:07:29.276 --> 01:07:31.403
Listen to me.

01:07:36.316 --> 01:07:38.750
I only came on to you
to get the Faxton account.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.754
That's the only reason?

01:07:43.156 --> 01:07:44.418
Yeah.

01:07:49.296 --> 01:07:50.923
You're cruel like a man.

01:07:56.903 --> 01:07:59.633
Sheila, listen to me.
Let me explain to you.

01:07:59.706 --> 01:08:01.674
- Listen, you don't understand.
- But I do.

01:08:03.076 --> 01:08:05.840
- You having a problem, Miss Faxton?
- Hey, fuck off, okay?

01:08:05.912 --> 01:08:08.608
- It's all right, Nancy.
- No, it's not all right, Nancy.

01:08:08.682 --> 01:08:10.616
I don't like being grabbed.

01:08:22.595 --> 01:08:24.029
Oh, geez!

01:08:49.456 --> 01:08:52.185
As you could see,
I'm not doing very good so far.

01:08:54.694 --> 01:08:57.663
Would it be kosher
if I prayed to You for a little help?

01:09:04.904 --> 01:09:07.430
Well, I'm not giving up yet.

01:09:12.312 --> 01:09:14.779
It's 3:00 a.m. in the BigApple,
and coming to you direct...

01:09:14.848 --> 01:09:17.908
from the Gahena Casino,
located on the Hades turnpike...

01:09:17.984 --> 01:09:20.919
a stone's throw from the center
ofthe Earth, the molten music...

01:09:20.987 --> 01:09:24.013
of Judas Iscariot
and his 30-piece orchestra.

01:09:25.725 --> 01:09:27.819
What is that smell?

01:09:27.894 --> 01:09:29.987
Brimstone.

01:09:30.063 --> 01:09:32.792
You'll get used to it
after a few hundred years.

01:09:32.866 --> 01:09:34.527
Who in hell are you?

01:09:36.603 --> 01:09:38.935
Who in hell do you think I am?

01:09:41.841 --> 01:09:43.776
You look like the devil.

01:09:43.844 --> 01:09:46.438
Well, you don't look
so good yourself.

01:09:47.413 --> 01:09:50.076
Just a little
netherworld humor there.

01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:55.177
Hilarious.
What do you want?

01:09:58.291 --> 01:09:59.553
You.

01:09:59.626 --> 01:10:02.094
- Your time's up.
- Says who?

01:10:02.162 --> 01:10:04.926
Have you found one female
who likes Steve Brooks?

01:10:04.998 --> 01:10:07.057
Well, I haven't
talked to them all yet.

01:10:07.134 --> 01:10:11.070
You'd just be wasting your time.
You see, I know who they are...

01:10:11.138 --> 01:10:16.440
and they all think that Steve Brooks
is a selfish, inconsiderate...

01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:19.343
unredeemable male chauvinist pig.

01:10:19.412 --> 01:10:22.006
I don't believe you! You're
not to be trusted. You're the devil.

01:10:22.082 --> 01:10:25.813
Anyway, you know, He/She didn't give me
any timetable on this thing.

01:10:25.886 --> 01:10:28.047
- Look, you hate being a woman, right?
- Well--

01:10:28.121 --> 01:10:32.148
There's no fun in PMS
or shaving your legs.

01:10:32.225 --> 01:10:34.056
And what have you got
to look forward to?

01:10:34.127 --> 01:10:37.494
Guys like you used to be,
always trying to get into your pants?

01:10:37.564 --> 01:10:40.226
Cellulite, menopause.

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.860
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

01:10:44.104 --> 01:10:47.699
Right now there's a shortage
of good recruiters.

01:10:47.774 --> 01:10:50.436
I bet there's not a man alive
who wouldn't sell his soul...

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:53.707
for the chance
to jump in the sack with you.

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:55.372
Forget it!

01:10:56.283 --> 01:11:00.447
Sooner or later
I'm going to get you anyway.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.889
Come along now, and I'll guarantee you
a hell of a time.

01:11:04.958 --> 01:11:10.055
If you're gonna get me anyway, I'd just
as soon it was later and not sooner.

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:14.829
Terrible sight, to see a beautiful body
like yours go through a meltdown.

01:11:16.336 --> 01:11:19.271
- What?
- Tell you what.

01:11:19.339 --> 01:11:21.398
You want to hedge your bet with me?

01:11:21.474 --> 01:11:24.875
Make eternity a little less...

01:11:24.945 --> 01:11:26.242
hellish?

01:11:28.415 --> 01:11:30.542
What did you have in mind?

01:11:30.617 --> 01:11:33.017
Did you see Rosemary's Baby?

01:11:33.086 --> 01:11:36.146
Yeah. What? No! No!

01:11:36.223 --> 01:11:40.216
I can't, see?
I'm expecting my periods.

01:11:40.293 --> 01:11:42.352
I can't. I can't.

01:11:48.468 --> 01:11:50.129
- It's straight up 8:00...
- What?

01:11:50.203 --> 01:11:52.364
from the center ofthe known universe,
New York City.

01:11:52.439 --> 01:11:55.340
This is Ross Brittain,
and we're locked into a pretty nice da y.

01:11:55.408 --> 01:11:59.712
Sunshine, blue skies, so check
your body parts and let's get bus y!

01:12:01.747 --> 01:12:03.681
Sorry I'm late.

01:12:13.726 --> 01:12:16.752
I've called this meeting
to congratulate Amanda...

01:12:16.829 --> 01:12:19.525
for convincing Miss Faxton...

01:12:19.598 --> 01:12:23.090
that F&B is the best agency
to handle Faxton Cosmetics...

01:12:23.168 --> 01:12:26.001
and to hear personally
from Miss Faxton...

01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:31.441
what ideas she might have
to put us on the right track.

01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:33.444
Miss Faxton?

01:12:34.446 --> 01:12:37.904
Well, obviously, I have some ideas.

01:12:37.983 --> 01:12:41.441
Faxton Cosmetics is the keystone
to Faxton, Inc...

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.012
and I intend to work hands-on
with the account executive.

01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:50.027
Therefore, I expect you to give me
your most qualified, most experienced...

01:12:50.095 --> 01:12:52.427
and most political executive.

01:12:52.498 --> 01:12:56.662
Naturally.
Do you have someone in mind?

01:12:56.735 --> 01:12:59.033
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

01:13:01.273 --> 01:13:02.797
What about Dan?

01:13:05.377 --> 01:13:07.811
- Oh, I'd be honored.
- Fine.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.472
- Good.
- Then it's settled.

01:13:09.548 --> 01:13:11.812
Absolutely. I understand.

01:13:12.885 --> 01:13:15.353
Congratulations, Dan.

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.651
Thanks.
I want you on the team.

01:13:18.724 --> 01:13:22.125
Oh, good. Why don't we
discuss it over dinner...

01:13:22.194 --> 01:13:23.559
at Sardi's?

01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:27.326
Unless you prefer to go someplace
a little more private.

01:13:27.399 --> 01:13:30.596
No. Sardi's is great.

01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:32.694
Good.

01:13:32.771 --> 01:13:35.035
Then I can show you off.

01:13:37.643 --> 01:13:42.671
Amanda, I located Rebecca Heckencamp
who is now Mrs. Rebecca Sanderson...

01:13:42.748 --> 01:13:44.648
still living in Allentown.

01:13:44.716 --> 01:13:46.650
Good. Get her.

01:13:48.687 --> 01:13:52.714
Amanda, something's come up, and
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

01:13:52.791 --> 01:13:55.954
Sheila Faxton wants to talk to you
about the account, huh?

01:13:56.028 --> 01:13:58.121
Yeah. I'm really disappointed.

01:13:58.197 --> 01:14:01.291
I was looking forward
to getting to know you better.

01:14:01.366 --> 01:14:03.926
Next week, maybe?
Monday? Tuesday?

01:14:04.002 --> 01:14:05.663
Look, don't push it Dan, okay?

01:14:11.443 --> 01:14:12.910
Schmuck.

01:14:12.978 --> 01:14:14.570
Rebecca Sanderson.

01:14:16.148 --> 01:14:17.479
- Rebecca.
- Yes?

01:14:17.549 --> 01:14:21.041
I'm doing a book
about the advertising business...

01:14:21.119 --> 01:14:23.553
and the men who've been
successful in the field.

01:14:23.622 --> 01:14:26.648
I understand that you went
to high school with Mr. Steven Brooks.

01:14:26.725 --> 01:14:29.660
Steven Brooks? The prick
that knocked me up? I hate his guts!

01:14:29.728 --> 01:14:32.458
Really? I'm shocked because,
you know...

01:14:32.531 --> 01:14:34.556
that's not at all
the way he remembers it.

01:14:34.633 --> 01:14:38.535
Well, he has a lousy memory. Ifl ever
see him again I'll rip his balls off!

01:14:38.604 --> 01:14:41.038
And you still feel that way
after all these years?

01:14:41.106 --> 01:14:43.904
- You bet I do. That son ofa bitch--
- Oh, I understand. Yeah.

01:14:43.976 --> 01:14:45.910
I just can't print it.

01:14:49.982 --> 01:14:52.542
Getting down to the bottom
of the barrel, slick.

01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:00.552
So it looks like Danny boy's gonna be
tied up for the weekend, huh?

01:15:01.894 --> 01:15:04.089
Tied up is a definite possibility.

01:15:05.163 --> 01:15:08.997
- Wanna go to Duke's?
- Sure. We'll shoot some straight pool.

01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:13.267
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:15:27.052 --> 01:15:29.179
- Hello?
- Hello, Brenda?

01:15:29.254 --> 01:15:31.848
- Who is this?
- I'm calling about Steven Brooks--

01:15:31.924 --> 01:15:34.222
- Go fuck yourself.
- Hello? Brenda?

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.095
Shit!

01:15:47.572 --> 01:15:50.268
Did you call your hairdresser?

01:15:50.342 --> 01:15:52.572
Yeah, but he can't take you
until next Wednesday.

01:15:52.644 --> 01:15:56.375
What did-- Fuck!
All's I want is a fucking haircut!

01:16:25.277 --> 01:16:28.906
- What can I do foryou?
- I'll take a ham on rye.

01:16:30.048 --> 01:16:32.107
This is a barber shop,
not a delicatessen.

01:16:32.184 --> 01:16:34.812
Oh. Well, then, why don't you
give me a haircut?

01:16:40.158 --> 01:16:42.649
Laura, Higgins.
Wife still out of town?

01:16:46.431 --> 01:16:50.492
Hey, Walt. Sorry I'm so late.
Had one of those psycho cab drivers.

01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:53.895
What?

01:16:53.972 --> 01:16:56.133
Oh, yeah. I had a haircut.

01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:58.438
- Like it?
- Yeah, it's--

01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:00.444
It's just such a surprise.
You don't have any--

01:17:00.512 --> 01:17:02.241
What happened?
You looked so beautiful.

01:17:02.314 --> 01:17:05.010
It took me an hour
to blow it dry every morning.

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:07.278
- Hi, Amanda.
- Yo, Casanova.

01:17:07.352 --> 01:17:09.479
- What are you drinking?
- Bud.

01:17:09.554 --> 01:17:11.146
Two Buds.

01:17:14.459 --> 01:17:16.859
- Where'd you learn to shoot?
- Misspent youth.

01:17:17.929 --> 01:17:19.863
I bet you could beat Steve.

01:17:21.533 --> 01:17:23.398
I doubt it.

01:17:24.469 --> 01:17:27.199
Hey, that's her. She's the one
I was telling you about last night.

01:17:27.272 --> 01:17:29.103
- Her?
- Yeah.

01:17:29.174 --> 01:17:31.142
Cut her hair.
That's more like it.

01:17:31.209 --> 01:17:33.700
- Last night I though she was a girl.
- Hey, guys.

01:17:34.813 --> 01:17:37.646
- Let it go, Walter.
- She hit you when you wasn't looking?

01:17:37.716 --> 01:17:40.480
- You gotta be kidding me. Her?
- We're in the middle of a game here.

01:17:40.552 --> 01:17:42.179
Forget about it, Walter.

01:17:42.254 --> 01:17:45.223
Hey, Walter, you with her--
him-- whatever she is?

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:48.316
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?
- Looks like you got the problem.

01:17:49.427 --> 01:17:51.725
- We should take the problem outside.
- Let's go do it.

01:18:34.572 --> 01:18:36.597
Hey, doll face,
did somebody hurt you?

01:18:44.382 --> 01:18:44.749
Okay. Come on, bud.

01:18:44.749 --> 01:18:46.740
Okay. Come on, bud.

01:18:46.818 --> 01:18:50.345
Oh, for Christ's fucking sake,
Walter, you're really gaining weight.

01:18:51.423 --> 01:18:53.618
How you doing there,
Mrs. Wetherspoon?

01:18:53.692 --> 01:18:56.593
Oh,Jesus Christ.
Okay, you.

01:18:57.696 --> 01:18:58.958
Oh, yeah.

01:19:03.368 --> 01:19:04.926
- Okay.
- Amanda?

01:19:05.003 --> 01:19:06.766
Yeah, Walter. It's me.

01:19:14.846 --> 01:19:17.440
Oh, God.
Hey, cut it out, Walter.

01:19:17.515 --> 01:19:19.142
Jesus!

01:19:19.217 --> 01:19:20.980
Okay. Come on, bud.

01:19:21.052 --> 01:19:23.384
I got you. I got you.

01:19:23.455 --> 01:19:25.719
I got you now.
Okay.

01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:27.553
Here you go.

01:19:43.575 --> 01:19:45.475
Okay, come on, Walter.
Take off your pants.

01:19:45.543 --> 01:19:48.842
Why, Miss Brooks,
what would your brother say?

01:19:48.913 --> 01:19:51.438
You know you're too drunk
to get home.

01:19:51.516 --> 01:19:53.416
- You'll have to sleep here.
- Okay.

01:19:53.485 --> 01:19:57.080
So we'll take off your pants
and then--

01:19:57.155 --> 01:19:59.623
Come on, Walter.
Quit fooling around now.

01:19:59.691 --> 01:20:02.717
- Okay. I'll help.
- Get into bed.

01:20:02.794 --> 01:20:05.763
Give me a hand here, Walter.
Come on, pretty boy. That's it.

01:20:11.903 --> 01:20:13.837
Okay. Quit fucking around.

01:20:23.048 --> 01:20:25.710
- Okay, come on. Get in the bed, Walter.
- Yes, dear.

01:20:29.988 --> 01:20:31.250
Oh, God.

01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:41.596
- The lights are on.
- Yeah, I know the light's on.

01:20:42.934 --> 01:20:46.199
What do you think I am? You think
I don't know when the light is on?

01:20:49.174 --> 01:20:50.436
Schmuck.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.508
Get your hand off my ass.

01:21:00.018 --> 01:21:02.350
You sure?

01:21:10.562 --> 01:21:13.395
No more hanky-panky, Walter.

01:21:13.465 --> 01:21:15.262
No more hanky-panky.

01:21:28.279 --> 01:21:30.179
I'm up! I'm up.

01:21:36.788 --> 01:21:38.050
Oh, yeah.

01:21:42.293 --> 01:21:44.761
- Hello.
- Mrs. Brofman here to see you.

01:21:44.829 --> 01:21:47.559
What?
What the hell time is it?

01:21:47.632 --> 01:21:49.566
It's a quarterto 10:00.

01:21:51.703 --> 01:21:53.637
Okay. Send her up.

01:21:54.372 --> 01:21:56.840
- Go on up.
- Thanks, Mac.

01:21:59.244 --> 01:22:00.836
Ridiculous.

01:22:02.413 --> 01:22:04.074
Oh, my God Alm--

01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:13.824
Walter, where are your shorts?

01:22:20.098 --> 01:22:23.226
When you went to bed last night
you were wearing your shorts.

01:22:23.301 --> 01:22:27.135
- Now, when did you take them off?
- I don't recall the exact moment.

01:22:27.205 --> 01:22:29.400
And wipe that stupid smile
off your face.

01:22:29.474 --> 01:22:32.034
Walter, how come
you took your shorts off?

01:22:33.077 --> 01:22:35.602
- Amanda, don't you remember?
- Remember what, Walter?

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:38.478
- Remember what?
- Well, we made love.

01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:47.252
Son of a bitch.

01:22:49.661 --> 01:22:52.255
- Good morning.
- What's so fucking good about it?

01:22:53.364 --> 01:22:56.822
You're in a great mood.
What's the matter? Got your period?

01:22:56.901 --> 01:22:59.165
I should be so fucking lucky.

01:22:59.237 --> 01:23:01.171
Yeah? What happened?

01:23:03.441 --> 01:23:04.965
It's a long story.

01:23:06.377 --> 01:23:08.311
Just give me the punch line.

01:23:11.216 --> 01:23:12.843
I lost my virginity.

01:23:15.553 --> 01:23:17.487
Obviously without your consent.

01:23:17.555 --> 01:23:19.352
I passed out.
I don't remember anything.

01:23:19.424 --> 01:23:22.086
- Who's the unlucky man?
- Hi, Margo.

01:23:24.963 --> 01:23:28.763
Well, it's not exactly Romeo and Juliet,
but, then, I always say to each his own.

01:23:28.833 --> 01:23:30.994
- Amanda, we gotta talk.
- I don't talk to rapists.

01:23:31.069 --> 01:23:33.833
- Rapists?
- I was drunk, passed out.

01:23:33.905 --> 01:23:36.237
- She loved it!
- Bullshit, Walt!

01:23:36.307 --> 01:23:38.639
Don't you give me
that macho, self-serving crap.

01:23:38.710 --> 01:23:41.440
I was unconscious, buddy boy.
I didn't love anything.

01:23:41.512 --> 01:23:43.241
I was helpless.
You took advantage of me.

01:23:43.314 --> 01:23:45.441
I have never taken advantage
of anybody in my life.

01:23:45.516 --> 01:23:48.610
That's what all you guys say. You take
a girl out for dinner, get her drunk.

01:23:48.686 --> 01:23:52.349
It's date rape, Walt. Read the paper.
It happens all the time.

01:23:52.423 --> 01:23:54.584
- Well, not here last night.
- I don't believe it.

01:23:54.659 --> 01:23:57.856
I mean, after all the years
we've been buddies, it's like--

01:23:57.929 --> 01:24:00.898
You know, guys like you are
what's wrong with society.

01:24:00.965 --> 01:24:03.729
- All the years we've been buddies?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

01:24:03.801 --> 01:24:05.564
Don't try to change the subject here.

01:24:05.637 --> 01:24:08.868
Do you realize every six minutes
a woman is raped in this country?

01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:11.636
- I didn't realize. I'm sorry.
- You didn't realize. Why should you?

01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:15.941
Why should you care? You're one of the
assholes responsible for the statistic!

01:24:16.014 --> 01:24:17.914
- Now, wait a goddamn minute--
- For what, Walt?

01:24:17.982 --> 01:24:21.179
Foryou to rape some other poor,
innocent, unsuspecting female?

01:24:21.252 --> 01:24:23.243
I was a virgin, goddamn you!

01:24:27.725 --> 01:24:31.752
This morning, the body of Steven Brooks,
New York advertising executive...

01:24:31.829 --> 01:24:34.195
was discovered floating
in the East River.

01:24:34.265 --> 01:24:38.065
According to the police, Brooks
had been shot three times in the chest.

01:24:38.136 --> 01:24:41.799
We'll continue to report on the facts
ofthis case as they unfold.

01:24:41.873 --> 01:24:46.173
And, when we return, Ken L omax will
bring you the entertainment report.

01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:57.482
Hello?

01:25:04.896 --> 01:25:06.830
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure.

01:25:22.647 --> 01:25:24.581
Well, who was that?

01:25:29.454 --> 01:25:31.388
It was the police.

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.228
I gotta identify my body.

01:25:42.166 --> 01:25:45.727
Sorry to do this to you, but apparently
you're his only living relative.

01:25:50.808 --> 01:25:54.300
This isn't going to be very pleasant.
The body's been in the water for days.

01:25:58.649 --> 01:26:01.720
God, I look awful.

01:26:08.226 --> 01:26:10.251
Holy shit.

01:26:13.631 --> 01:26:15.963
Jesus H. Christ.

01:26:16.034 --> 01:26:18.559
- Miss Brooks--
- Oh, Higgins.

01:26:18.636 --> 01:26:22.402
- The police came with a search warrant.
- What?

01:26:22.474 --> 01:26:26.205
If they arrest you, please don't say
anything about the little redhead.

01:26:26.277 --> 01:26:28.837
What makes you think
they're gonna arrest me?

01:26:28.913 --> 01:26:30.904
They found your gun.

01:26:36.121 --> 01:26:39.887
This whole thing feels
like a bad dream.

01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:49.193
Are you really sure
that they can't trace that gun?

01:26:50.602 --> 01:26:52.797
Not a chance.

01:26:54.506 --> 01:26:55.973
You bitch!

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.565
You planted that gun
in my apartment.

01:26:59.911 --> 01:27:02.607
The gun's not registered!
They'll never trace it!

01:27:03.448 --> 01:27:06.144
You killed me, Margo.
I'm not taking the rap for it.

01:27:06.217 --> 01:27:09.243
What are you gonna tell them?
"You're not really a woman"?

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.585
-You're Steve Brooks back from the dead?
-I got you to believe me, didn't I?

01:27:16.594 --> 01:27:20.621
They'll lock you away in a padded cell
and throw away the key!

01:27:20.698 --> 01:27:23.963
You'll never find that one female
who's gonna get you into heaven.

01:27:26.704 --> 01:27:28.296
How much money you got?

01:27:29.374 --> 01:27:32.275
Three thousand.
It's in my purse on the bed.

01:27:35.013 --> 01:27:39.507
Direct from New York to LosAngeles,
here at gate number one.

01:27:49.494 --> 01:27:52.691
Miss Brooks.
Going someplace?

01:27:53.765 --> 01:27:56.256
No, I just like
to hang around airports.

01:27:56.334 --> 01:27:59.269
You're under arrest for the murder
of Steven Brooks.

01:27:59.337 --> 01:28:01.362
You invited Mr. Brooks to the party.

01:28:01.439 --> 01:28:03.407
Yes, but he never showed up.

01:28:03.474 --> 01:28:04.270
She's lying!

01:28:05.777 --> 01:28:07.608
- Your witness.
- When did you meet the defendant?

01:28:07.679 --> 01:28:09.613
The morning after the party.

01:28:12.417 --> 01:28:14.442
What did she tell you?

01:28:14.519 --> 01:28:17.545
That she was Steve Brooks
reincarnated as a woman.

01:28:18.857 --> 01:28:21.291
- What else did she tell you?
- That I shot him.

01:28:23.261 --> 01:28:25.024
Who?

01:28:25.096 --> 01:28:26.620
Him. Her.

01:28:26.698 --> 01:28:30.361
- What else did she say?
- That God had sent him back.

01:28:30.435 --> 01:28:34.394
- Would you mind speaking up, please?
- That God had sent him back...

01:28:34.472 --> 01:28:37.066
and that he couldn't get into heaven
until he found...

01:28:37.141 --> 01:28:39.905
one female who liked him.

01:28:39.978 --> 01:28:43.744
- Him?
- Steve. Her.

01:28:46.751 --> 01:28:48.514
But she was drunk.

01:28:48.586 --> 01:28:50.554
No, I wasn't that drunk.

01:28:54.225 --> 01:28:57.626
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth?

01:28:57.695 --> 01:29:00.493
- So help me, God.
- State your name.

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:03.892
Steven Brooks.

01:29:05.403 --> 01:29:09.362
It's been five months, Walter.
You gotta get me outta here.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:10.930
I'm doing the best that I can.

01:29:11.009 --> 01:29:12.772
- So how do you feel?
- How do I feel?

01:29:12.844 --> 01:29:15.210
How the fuck do you think I feel,
Walter?

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:17.305
I'm gonna have a baby.

01:29:17.382 --> 01:29:20.681
It's your fucking fault. I'd like
to strangle you. That's how I feel.

01:29:20.752 --> 01:29:24.449
Look I'm sorry. I don't know if you
recall, but you were very cooperative.

01:29:24.522 --> 01:29:28.253
I simply do not choose
to accept that fact, Walter.

01:29:28.326 --> 01:29:32.695
Drunk or sober, do you think
that for one cotton-picking second...

01:29:32.764 --> 01:29:37.326
Steve Brooks would ever even consider
making love to another man...

01:29:37.402 --> 01:29:39.393
Iet alone his best friend?

01:29:40.538 --> 01:29:42.836
Steve Brooks? No.

01:29:42.907 --> 01:29:46.604
- You still don't believe I'm Steve.
- I don't, and I'm gonna tell you why.

01:29:46.678 --> 01:29:50.307
Three years ago, your birthday.
I sent you a little brunette.

01:29:50.381 --> 01:29:53.043
- You called her Aztec.
- Hey!

01:29:53.117 --> 01:29:55.483
Look, I don't know
how you know about that.

01:29:56.554 --> 01:29:59.489
If Steve Brooks did get pregnant,
he'd have an abortion.

01:29:59.557 --> 01:30:01.548
I nearly did.

01:30:01.626 --> 01:30:04.493
Why'd you change your mind?

01:30:04.562 --> 01:30:06.894
You're not gonna believe this, but...

01:30:06.965 --> 01:30:09.024
there I was, lying on that table...

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.069
and I had my feet
in those stirrupy things...

01:30:12.136 --> 01:30:17.164
and all of a sudden,
it just came to me in a flash...

01:30:17.241 --> 01:30:21.837
that maybe the only reason I wasn't
roasting somewhere in hell was--

01:30:24.515 --> 01:30:27.313
was because God wanted me
to have this baby.

01:30:28.386 --> 01:30:30.547
That's the only reason?

01:30:30.621 --> 01:30:33.522
And making
the Guinness Book of Records.

01:30:33.591 --> 01:30:35.422
I don't know.
I guess you really are Steve.

01:30:37.161 --> 01:30:40.358
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. Oh, God!

01:30:42.467 --> 01:30:47.234
Dr. Gold to O.B. room 501, please.

01:31:20.371 --> 01:31:22.134
How'd you know it was me?

01:31:22.206 --> 01:31:24.367
Old Spice.

01:31:24.442 --> 01:31:28.105
And you tiptoe louder
than Gregory Hines tap-dances.

01:31:29.914 --> 01:31:31.848
Don't punch him.

01:31:40.358 --> 01:31:42.986
I talked to the doctor today,
you know?

01:31:43.061 --> 01:31:44.926
Oh, yeah?

01:31:45.997 --> 01:31:47.931
What'd he say?

01:31:49.534 --> 01:31:51.468
He's worried about you.

01:31:54.772 --> 01:31:56.967
Says you got high blood pressure...

01:31:58.042 --> 01:31:59.202
and...

01:32:00.111 --> 01:32:01.544
diabetes.

01:32:04.315 --> 01:32:07.443
I'm a big girl, Walt.
Cut to the chase.

01:32:09.787 --> 01:32:13.621
He said that if you carry
the baby to full term...

01:32:13.691 --> 01:32:16.091
that there's a possibility
that you might--

01:32:21.499 --> 01:32:22.693
Die?

01:32:26.137 --> 01:32:27.866
What about the baby, Walter?

01:32:28.973 --> 01:32:31.271
Well, see, that's the thing.

01:32:31.342 --> 01:32:34.072
He said that if you decide
not to have the baby, then--

01:32:34.145 --> 01:32:37.637
Oh, no.
I'm having the baby, Walter.

01:32:38.716 --> 01:32:40.445
Can we talk about this?

01:32:40.518 --> 01:32:43.214
No, we can't talk about this.

01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:53.396
You can't imagine what it's like...

01:32:53.464 --> 01:32:55.659
to have a life inside you.

01:32:55.733 --> 01:33:00.432
And it's growing, Walter.
It's moving.

01:33:00.505 --> 01:33:02.905
It lives because I live.

01:33:05.243 --> 01:33:07.734
And when I die...

01:33:08.813 --> 01:33:10.747
there's a part of me that...

01:33:12.617 --> 01:33:14.050
goes on.

01:33:20.458 --> 01:33:22.392
It's a a truly amazing thing.

01:33:24.962 --> 01:33:28.625
It is an honest-to-God miracle.

01:33:33.237 --> 01:33:36.331
Which reminds me, you know...

01:33:36.407 --> 01:33:40.503
just in case
what the doctor says is true...

01:33:40.578 --> 01:33:42.170
you know--

01:33:45.049 --> 01:33:48.348
How do you feel
about being a full-time father?

01:33:51.022 --> 01:33:52.649
Great.

01:33:52.723 --> 01:33:54.782
I knew you wouldn't
let me down, buddy.

01:33:56.127 --> 01:33:57.719
Well...

01:33:59.397 --> 01:34:02.195
don't you think
we ought to get married first?

01:34:03.968 --> 01:34:06.869
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

01:34:10.041 --> 01:34:12.407
- I gotta get some rest here, Walt.
- Okay.

01:34:15.813 --> 01:34:17.405
Good night, honey.

01:34:18.249 --> 01:34:19.851
"Honey"?

01:34:19.984 --> 01:34:22.680
Amanda, do you take Walter
to be your lawful wedded husband?

01:34:30.628 --> 01:34:31.925
I do.

01:34:34.198 --> 01:34:36.530
And do you, Walter, take Amanda
to be your lawful wedded wife?

01:34:37.468 --> 01:34:38.730
I do.

01:34:40.671 --> 01:34:42.104
The rings.

01:34:43.841 --> 01:34:45.274
Oh, yeah.

01:34:48.813 --> 01:34:52.112
With this ring I thee wed.

01:34:58.222 --> 01:35:00.156
There ya go, Walt.

01:35:02.627 --> 01:35:04.925
I now pronounce you...

01:35:04.996 --> 01:35:06.588
husband and wife.

01:35:21.312 --> 01:35:22.904
Mr. Stone.

01:35:24.282 --> 01:35:25.715
Morning.

01:35:27.785 --> 01:35:31.221
Walter,
I won't beat about the bush.

01:35:32.156 --> 01:35:35.751
Your marriage has become
an embarrassment to the firm, so...

01:35:36.928 --> 01:35:38.828
I'm going to have to let you go.

01:35:41.365 --> 01:35:45.426
Well, I was gonna
quit anyway, Arnold.

01:35:45.503 --> 01:35:49.735
See, I'm gonna become a father soon, and
it would really be an embarrassment...

01:35:49.807 --> 01:35:52.640
for me to have to tell my kid
that I work for somebody like you.

01:35:55.279 --> 01:35:57.975
Dr. Harrison to O.B. I. C. U.

01:36:11.195 --> 01:36:12.423
- That's it. Hold on.
- Push!

01:36:16.767 --> 01:36:19.201
- You gotta breathe a little.
- One more.

01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:21.204
Yes, push.

01:36:24.208 --> 01:36:26.608
That's it.
You're doing fine.

01:36:28.713 --> 01:36:30.772
- That's it. Push. Good.
- No, don't!

01:36:31.682 --> 01:36:35.812
You got it. Almost there now.
That's it. Very good.

01:36:36.554 --> 01:36:39.182
Congratulations.
It's a girl.

01:36:44.729 --> 01:36:46.321
Look.

01:37:09.687 --> 01:37:11.746
- You know what, Walt?
- What?

01:37:11.822 --> 01:37:13.756
I think she likes me.

01:37:32.476 --> 01:37:36.105
- Something's wrong, Doctor.
- Get her B.P. Take the baby now.

01:37:40.551 --> 01:37:44.146
What the hell's wrong?
She's not hemorrhaging.

01:37:44.221 --> 01:37:46.314
- What's wrong? Amanda.
- Mr. Stone.

01:37:48.092 --> 01:37:50.026
Somebody do something!

01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:02.537
Wow. What a beautiful baby.

01:38:02.606 --> 01:38:04.597
Yes, you did well.

01:38:04.675 --> 01:38:06.609
Wish I could be there
and watch her grow up.

01:38:06.677 --> 01:38:08.611
Oh, you can watch her grow up.

01:38:08.679 --> 01:38:12.513
But in the meantime you have to decide
whether you want to be a male--

01:38:12.583 --> 01:38:14.676
Or a female angel.

01:38:14.752 --> 01:38:18.552
Oh, he y. That's a tough one.

01:38:18.622 --> 01:38:20.954
Okay if I think about it
for a while?

01:38:39.677 --> 01:38:41.611
I love you, Mommy.

01:38:52.356 --> 01:38:53.789
Let's go.

01:39:00.598 --> 01:39:02.225
Have you made up your mind?

01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:06.293
Look, I don 't want to be a problem, but,
you know, it's not an easy decision.

01:39:06.370 --> 01:39:09.362
- I really liked being a man.
- Naturally.

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:13.035
- But being a woman had its advantages.
- Definitely.

01:39:13.110 --> 01:39:15.374
Could I think about it
just a little longer?

01:39:15.446 --> 01:39:19.883
Take your time.
You have all eternity.
