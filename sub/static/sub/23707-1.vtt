00:21.054 --> 00:25.218
<i>And every time it rains</i>
<i>It rains pennies from heaven</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:30.726
<i>Don't you know each cloud</i>
<i>contains pennies from heaven?</i>

00:32.198 --> 00:34.894
<i>You'll find your fortune falling</i>

00:34.968 --> 00:36.560
<i>All over town</i>

00:37.237 --> 00:42.072
<i>Be sure that your umbrella</i>
<i>is up-up-up-up-upside down</i>

00:42.142 --> 00:46.007
<i>And trade them for a</i>
<i>package of sunshine and ravioli</i>

00:46.112 --> 00:48.344
<i>Nice weather we're having, huh?</i>

00:49.282 --> 00:51.648
<i>Here in the kingdom of Malaria,</i>

00:51.718 --> 00:56.951
<i>every day's forecast is rainy</i>
<i>with a 100% chance of horror.</i>

00:58.324 --> 00:59.621
<i>It wasn't always like this, though.</i>

01:00.360 --> 01:03.193
<i>Years ago, Malaria was</i>
<i>a sunny land of farmers.</i>

01:03.263 --> 01:06.699
<i>Until the mysterious storm clouds</i>
<i>rolled in and never left.</i>

01:08.535 --> 01:12.528
<i>They killed our crops,</i>
<i>and our people became poor.</i>

01:12.605 --> 01:16.803
<i>And that's when King Malbert thought</i>
<i>up a new way for us to make money,</i>

01:16.876 --> 01:18.741
<i>Evil Inventions.</i>

01:18.812 --> 01:21.872
<i>The kind that crush you,</i>
<i>kill you, bring you back to life,</i>

01:21.948 --> 01:24.473
<i>then kill you again, way worse.</i>

01:24.551 --> 01:27.019
<i>We invent them, and the world</i>
<i>pays us not to unleash them.</i>

01:27.087 --> 01:31.217
<i>Oh, it's a great gig,</i>
<i>especially if you're an Evil Scientist.</i>

01:31.291 --> 01:34.454
<i>Fame, fortune,</i>
<i>a rent-free castle in the hills.</i>

01:34.527 --> 01:36.757
<i>They get it all.</i>
<i>They're the top of the heap.</i>

01:36.830 --> 01:39.890
Igor! Pull the switch!

01:41.067 --> 01:43.535
Yes, Master!

01:43.603 --> 01:47.664
<i>And the bottom of the heap?</i>
<i>Those are the poor slobs like me,</i>

01:47.740 --> 01:50.800
<i>born with a hunch</i>
<i>on our back, Igors.</i>

01:51.244 --> 01:53.371
<i>Actually, that Igor's not me.</i>

01:54.981 --> 01:58.109
Igor! Pull the switch!

01:58.318 --> 02:00.445
Yes, Master!

02:00.854 --> 02:02.651
<i>No, no, no,</i>
<i>that's not me, either.</i>

02:07.327 --> 02:09.852
<i>That's me. See? I look</i>
<i>nothing like those other guys,</i>

02:09.929 --> 02:11.396
<i>much better-looking.</i>

02:11.464 --> 02:15.696
<i>Anyway, all Igors are forced</i>
<i>to serve Evil Scientists.</i>

02:16.169 --> 02:19.138
<i>Our life is a permanent</i>
<i>graveyard shift.</i>

02:19.205 --> 02:21.571
<i>But I never wanted to be an Igor.</i>

02:22.742 --> 02:25.438
<i>I always wanted to</i>
<i>be an Evil Scientist.</i>

02:25.512 --> 02:29.505
<i>Unfortunately, the hunch on</i>
<i>my back was a one-way ticket</i>

02:30.617 --> 02:32.084
<i>to Igor School.</i>

02:32.152 --> 02:36.213
<i>I majored in Talking With a Slur and</i>
<i>graduated with a Yes Masters Degree.</i>

02:37.257 --> 02:39.020
<i>Then, it was off to find a job.</i>

02:39.592 --> 02:43.289
Hi, I'm here about the "Igor Wanted" ad.
My name's Igor.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.763
Well, of course it is.
I've got a hunch on my back.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.766
What's my name gonna be? Kevin?

02:53.339 --> 02:55.330
<i>They didn't</i>
<i>appreciate my creative style.</i>

02:56.176 --> 02:58.872
<i>But eventually, I landed</i>
<i>a job for Dr. Glickenstein.</i>

02:58.945 --> 03:01.379
Pull the switch!

03:02.282 --> 03:03.909
<i>Not the</i>
<i>smartest scientist.</i>

03:03.983 --> 03:06.952
<i>His last invention</i>
<i>was an Evil Lasagna.</i>

03:07.020 --> 03:09.784
<i>It didn't kill anyone.</i>
<i>And it actually tasted pretty good.</i>

03:09.856 --> 03:10.948
Igor!

03:13.393 --> 03:15.258
<i>Igors aren't</i>
<i>allowed to invent,</i>

03:15.328 --> 03:18.195
<i>but I still manage to work on</i>
<i>my own inventions in secret.</i>

03:18.264 --> 03:20.095
<i>And this new one</i>
<i>is gonna be the one that proves</i>

03:20.166 --> 03:24.068
<i>that I'm the biggest Evil Genius</i>
<i>of them all, and not just another...</i>

03:24.137 --> 03:25.798
Igor!

03:30.610 --> 03:33.010
<i>Once they see what I can do,</i>
<i>I'll have a whole new life,</i>

03:33.079 --> 03:36.640
<i>and I'll never have to answer</i>
<i>to another master again.</i>

03:36.716 --> 03:38.616
- Sorry, Master.
- What did you say?

03:38.685 --> 03:40.084
Oh! I mean...

03:41.287 --> 03:44.916
Sorry, Master.
I was in the bathroom.

03:44.991 --> 03:49.291
Had a bat stuck in the belfry,
if you know what I mean, Master.

03:49.362 --> 03:52.388
I don't want to hear your
toilet memoirs, you cretin!

03:52.465 --> 03:55.923
I give you five minutes a week
to take care of your business.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.562
I'm not running a resort here!

03:58.638 --> 04:01.903
Now get over there and...

04:01.975 --> 04:03.704
Pull the switch!

04:03.776 --> 04:06.006
Yes, Master!

04:21.461 --> 04:23.691
Yes! Yes!

04:24.430 --> 04:26.057
Yes!

04:29.068 --> 04:32.265
Who's the failure now, Mother?

04:42.448 --> 04:45.144
Mummy,
Mummy, you were right!

04:45.218 --> 04:47.982
I was never meant to be a scientist.

04:48.054 --> 04:51.319
I should have been
a plumber like you!

04:52.325 --> 04:54.623
That was the first time
he was right all day.

04:54.694 --> 04:59.028
You! Go find me
a 16-gigawatt temporal transducer.

04:59.098 --> 05:03.398
Excuse me, Master, are you sure
you don't mean 21-gigawatt?

05:03.469 --> 05:05.528
You're correcting me?

05:08.041 --> 05:09.269
Strike!

05:10.810 --> 05:12.471
I should do more improv.

05:15.748 --> 05:16.976
My hunch.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.511
Oh, there she goes. Much better.

05:19.585 --> 05:21.610
<i>Good evening, friends!</i>

05:21.688 --> 05:25.055
<i>That's Scamper,</i>
<i>one of my most successful inventions.</i>

05:31.831 --> 05:33.162
<i>I made him immortal.</i>

05:33.232 --> 05:36.668
<i>Which is kind of a hassle</i>
<i>for him, since he doesn't want to live.</i>

05:36.736 --> 05:39.637
Will nothing end this vicious cycle?

05:39.706 --> 05:43.938
<i>I also made him talk. Which is</i>
<i>a hassle for me, since he never shuts up.</i>

05:44.010 --> 05:45.136
No fair!

05:45.211 --> 05:48.237
You wasted your immortality
formula on the wrong guy, Igor.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.714
<i>That's Brain, one</i>
<i>of my other inventions.</i>

05:50.783 --> 05:53.251
<i>Legend has it when</i>
<i>the smartest man in the world died,</i>

05:53.319 --> 05:55.287
<i>they put his brain in a jar.</i>

05:55.355 --> 05:57.289
<i>This is not that brain.</i>

05:58.424 --> 06:00.358
I wanna live forever!
I got plans! And dreams!

06:00.426 --> 06:02.621
I got a squeaky wheel! Was that me?

06:02.695 --> 06:03.719
Really, Brain?

06:03.796 --> 06:06.594
You want to be trapped in
an endless existential nightmare,

06:06.666 --> 06:07.690
forced to keep living,

06:07.767 --> 06:11.225
even though life is
meaningless and nothing matters?

06:11.304 --> 06:12.601
Possibly.

06:12.839 --> 06:14.534
What exactly did you say?

06:14.607 --> 06:18.441
Too bad he wasted his
intelligence formula on me, too, Brain.

06:18.511 --> 06:20.741
Or should I say "Brian"?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.246
Hey! I was in a hurry!

06:23.816 --> 06:25.579
Stupid permanent marker.

06:25.651 --> 06:26.640
Enough!

06:26.719 --> 06:28.152
The Evil Science Fair is in a week,

06:28.221 --> 06:30.712
and Glickenstein
is gonna lose again.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.588
Okay, I get it.
You want me to fix his invention.

06:33.659 --> 06:37.857
Now, I'll just need a screwdriver,
some nails and my bag of marbles.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.454
Don't touch his invention, Brain.

06:39.532 --> 06:42.399
Fine! You don't want the
benefit of my brain power?

06:42.468 --> 06:43.992
Then, farewell, Igor.

06:45.138 --> 06:48.266
Like a gentle fawn,
I shall leave this meadow.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.214
On second thought,
maybe I'll stick around,

07:01.387 --> 07:04.584
so I can watch Mr. Smarty-hunch
fix Glickenstein's invention.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.758
I could! But you know
what would happen if I did!

07:07.827 --> 07:10.796
The same thing he'd do if he
found out I invented you two.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.353
He'd recycle me.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.162
Can you imagine being
chopped up and used for body parts

07:15.234 --> 07:16.758
and God knows what else?

07:16.836 --> 07:18.064
Horrible.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.732
Dang it! Still here.

07:27.146 --> 07:28.875
If I had my shot,

07:28.948 --> 07:33.317
I could be one of the greatest
Evil Scientists Malaria has ever seen.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.452
They'd all cheer my name

07:36.522 --> 07:40.049
just like they do for the
great Dr. Schadenfreude!

07:58.010 --> 08:01.605
And now your
master of disaster, the chief of grief,

08:01.681 --> 08:03.342
a man who needs no introduction,

08:03.416 --> 08:06.180
but who will brutally
torture me if he doesn't get one,

08:06.252 --> 08:09.619
Dr. Schadenfreude!

08:10.857 --> 08:13.690
Thank you, thank you.
You're too kind!

08:13.759 --> 08:15.249
And I'm not.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.958
But I want to welcome you all to
my annual pre-Evil Science Fair party.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.329
My girlfriend Jaclyn.

08:21.400 --> 08:25.837
You know, she may seem like
a shallow, conniving wretch...

08:27.273 --> 08:29.901
That's all I got.
That pretty much sums her up.

08:32.345 --> 08:37.408
A toast to the undefeated
winner of 17 Evil Science Fairs

08:37.482 --> 08:40.611
and the greatest Evil
Genius in the world.

08:42.955 --> 08:44.889
Bow for the King!

08:48.528 --> 08:51.019
"The greatest Evil
Genius in the world."

08:51.097 --> 08:53.657
I remember when people
used to call me that.

08:53.733 --> 08:57.464
Back when the clouds destroyed
our peaceful land of farmers,

08:57.537 --> 09:01.473
and my plan to blackmail
the world saved us all!

09:01.541 --> 09:06.535
Yes, as you've told us
all over and over and over.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.204
Yeah, well, here's more.

09:08.281 --> 09:12.445
Did you know that years ago, Schoddy's
family name was Poekelmacher?

09:13.119 --> 09:15.952
His family were pickle-makers!

09:17.256 --> 09:21.454
So, what's your Evil Invention
this year, Doctor, kosher or dill?

09:24.630 --> 09:27.724
I want to shove a pickle
right where the sun don't shine.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.030
You mean Malaria, Master?

09:32.171 --> 09:34.901
No matter how many
Evil Science Fairs I win,

09:34.974 --> 09:37.966
I always have to
bow down to that idiot!

09:38.044 --> 09:40.171
I will never get the respect he gets!

09:40.246 --> 09:44.478
Respect? Respect isn't gonna
keep me in baby-seal boots.

09:46.118 --> 09:48.313
You just need to
keep on winning.

09:48.654 --> 09:51.987
Well, that is spoken
like a true worthless leech,

09:52.058 --> 09:56.859
who, by the way, still has not helped
me steal this year's winning invention.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.124
You know, maybe if
you were a real scientist,

09:59.198 --> 10:01.462
you wouldn't need me to
help you cheat every year.

10:04.337 --> 10:08.603
Your whole lab is fake,
just like you.

10:10.710 --> 10:15.477
And maybe I should throw you
back in the gutter where I found you!

10:15.881 --> 10:19.044
You're one to talk,
Dr. Schadenfraude!

10:19.619 --> 10:21.416
You don't have the guts.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.034
Is Daddy still mad at me?

10:36.102 --> 10:38.036
No.

10:38.104 --> 10:42.040
But you and your friend Heidi
still have a little job to do.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.673
Oh, we're trying.

10:44.744 --> 10:47.235
Well, try a little bit harder!

10:48.648 --> 10:50.115
Because this year,

10:50.182 --> 10:52.173
I won't stop at just
winning the Evil Science Fair.

10:53.352 --> 10:56.253
I'm gonna unleash
my winning invention

10:56.322 --> 11:00.190
on the King's smug little face,

11:00.259 --> 11:03.558
and then he'll be
the one groveling at my feet!

11:08.434 --> 11:10.061
Hi there!

11:10.136 --> 11:13.196
Look, it's your
little girlfriend, Heidi.

11:13.272 --> 11:14.534
You take a cocoa break,

11:14.607 --> 11:17.576
and I'll guard your plans
for your new invention.

11:17.643 --> 11:19.406
No, wait! You'll spill on my plans.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.139
Heidi, you're not careful enough!

11:21.213 --> 11:23.272
You're so sloppy sometimes.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.214
Oh, poopshkin.

11:25.284 --> 11:29.482
I went to the evil bookstore and
got you an inspirational poster.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.487
It's a little kitten!

11:32.558 --> 11:36.722
To remind you to always take time
in your day for a little torture.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.028
My transducer!

11:41.100 --> 11:43.694
Time to go!
I have no time for cocoa or kittens!

11:43.769 --> 11:45.498
I have to work on
my plans alone and in secret.

11:46.672 --> 11:48.765
In other words, bon voyage.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.877
Who doesn't like
tortured kittens?

11:53.612 --> 11:55.341
I... I like kittens.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.514
I don't like dirty
little hunchpeople.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.451
Great, Schadenfreude's
gonna kill me.

12:02.888 --> 12:06.346
And why are there
two transducers?

12:06.425 --> 12:10.987
Master, the 21-gigawatt
might be somewhat safer, I think.

12:11.263 --> 12:14.164
Think? Igors don't think.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.225
I'm using the 16-gigawatt, you fool!

12:17.837 --> 12:21.102
Now, get over there
and pull the switch!

12:24.844 --> 12:26.641
What are you waiting for?

12:26.712 --> 12:28.145
Yes, Master!

12:31.717 --> 12:33.878
Yes! Yes!

12:34.553 --> 12:36.214
Yes!

12:39.258 --> 12:42.659
I told you the 16 would work, you Igor!

12:44.530 --> 12:47.590
Behold my rocket ship!

12:48.868 --> 12:51.029
Born to stream
through the world,

12:51.103 --> 12:54.539
unleashing pain and
misery on everyone.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.875
I named her after you, Mother.

13:00.246 --> 13:04.205
Now to take the old
cow for a test drive.

13:04.884 --> 13:07.079
No, Master!
The rocket is going to...

13:15.027 --> 13:16.619
Uh... Yeah, that.

13:16.695 --> 13:17.957
Finally.

13:18.597 --> 13:22.590
Now I can throw out that rug in
the foyer. That thing is hideous.

13:22.668 --> 13:24.761
We were all thinking it. I just said it.

13:26.038 --> 13:27.699
Oh, no, who's that?
What am I gonna do?

13:27.773 --> 13:30.435
Relax, this is Glickenstein's castle.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.636
And he doesn't have to
open that door for anyone.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.372
Open for the King!

13:35.214 --> 13:36.909
- Except for the King.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

13:36.982 --> 13:38.779
He's here to see Glickenstein!
What do I tell him?

13:38.851 --> 13:40.148
Tell him the truth.
And if he kills us,

13:40.219 --> 13:42.744
I'll come back and give
you a beautiful funeral.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.450
Right, right. The truth,
that's a good option. Right, right.

13:46.458 --> 13:49.291
Glicky! Glicky, my boy!

13:49.361 --> 13:50.794
Where's Glicky?

13:50.863 --> 13:53.195
Your Highness, he's gone.

13:53.265 --> 13:55.460
Curse it! I need to see his invention.

13:55.534 --> 13:57.195
Schadenfreude is
getting too popular.

13:57.269 --> 13:58.793
The people might make him king.

13:58.871 --> 14:00.236
Someone has to beat him this year,

14:00.306 --> 14:02.501
with an invention
more evil than his.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.339
Someone who can snatch
Schadenfreude's number one position

14:05.411 --> 14:07.606
and rub his face in number two!

14:07.680 --> 14:08.738
Ew!

14:08.814 --> 14:14.309
Your Highness,
Dr. Glickenstein is creating life!

14:14.553 --> 14:15.986
Did you say "life"?

14:16.055 --> 14:17.079
Yes.

14:17.156 --> 14:22.025
Thinking, breathing life that can
destroy freely all on its own.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.787
No Evil Scientist has ever
been able to create life!

14:26.966 --> 14:28.957
Oh, sure, they've mutated life.
They've ended life.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.298
They've blasted life
into a million gooey pieces.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.167
But created life?

14:33.239 --> 14:38.472
A weapon like that would be
the greatest Evil Invention of all time.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.172
And its inventor
the greatest Evil Scientist of all time?

14:41.247 --> 14:43.545
Of course! This is what
I've been waiting for.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.414
And it's your job to make sure
nothing happens to Glickenstein,

14:46.485 --> 14:51.513
or I'll throw you down the recycling chute
and use your hunch as a speed bump!

14:52.758 --> 14:55.591
Oh, this is big.
Schadenfreude's winning streak is over.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.993
Come on, boys!
Let's go kick some old people.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.229
Ow! What is wrong with you?

15:02.301 --> 15:04.861
That's for having a death wish.
That's my thing.

15:04.937 --> 15:07.064
I am not gonna die, Scamper.

15:08.807 --> 15:11.037
For the first time ever,

15:11.110 --> 15:13.010
I'm gonna live!

15:21.820 --> 15:24.380
I sometimes come
down here to think.

15:24.957 --> 15:26.788
Wow, how interesting.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.451
What's next?
You're gonna pull out a guitar

15:28.527 --> 15:31.826
and play us a song you wrote in
college about being misunderstood?

15:44.677 --> 15:46.975
I know, right?
And she's not even done yet.

15:53.519 --> 15:56.181
<i>Baby, baby, it looks like it's gonna hail</i>

15:58.223 --> 16:01.124
<i>Baby, baby, it looks like it's gonna hail</i>

16:02.428 --> 16:03.793
<i>You better come inside</i>

16:03.862 --> 16:05.659
<i>Let me teach you how to jive and wail</i>

16:08.100 --> 16:10.830
Come on, bigger.
Do it. Come on, make it bigger.

16:12.571 --> 16:13.799
Bigger!

16:16.875 --> 16:20.572
Okay, to the left.
Very good. Now back to the right.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.739
No, no, no!

16:22.815 --> 16:27.616
To the left, now back to the right.
To the right. To the right.

16:27.686 --> 16:29.586
Is that even her hand?

16:38.864 --> 16:41.594
And now to
make her skin indestructible.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.964
<i>You gotta jump, jive,</i>
<i>and then you wail</i>

16:43.035 --> 16:45.196
<i>You gotta jump, jive,</i>
<i>and then you wail</i>

16:45.270 --> 16:47.636
<i>You gotta jump, jive,</i>
<i>and then you wail</i>

16:55.514 --> 16:58.244
Did you see that?
Shoot him again.

17:03.655 --> 17:04.815
And now, the crucial last piece,

17:04.890 --> 17:07.950
the source of all
the Monster's power,

17:11.497 --> 17:13.328
the Evil Bone.

17:16.101 --> 17:19.298
I have to hurry.
It loses its power in the light.

17:28.513 --> 17:29.879
That's it.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.241
Only one thing left to do.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.444
He said "do."

17:36.188 --> 17:38.952
Pull the switch!

17:45.264 --> 17:47.289
Do not yell at me.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.094
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just...

17:50.602 --> 17:52.194
Pull the switch.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.004
- Please pull the switch.
- That's better.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.510
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Why does he get to pull the switch?

18:00.679 --> 18:04.137
- Because I'm not an idiot, Brian.
- My name is not Brian!

18:04.216 --> 18:05.615
Then you must have his jar.

18:05.684 --> 18:11.145
Stop! You can both pull the switch.
On the count of three. One.

18:11.523 --> 18:14.617
Hey! No fair!
You said we could both pull the...

18:29.408 --> 18:31.239
Rise!

18:32.411 --> 18:34.242
Rise!

18:43.856 --> 18:44.948
I...

18:45.357 --> 18:47.086
I don't believe it.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.687
I'm a failure. I'm a...

18:51.396 --> 18:53.091
I'm an Igor.

18:53.165 --> 18:56.225
Get rid of that thing.
I never want to see it again.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.261
Funny you should say that.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.904
Uh... Igor? Yeah.
Where did the monster go?

19:05.978 --> 19:06.967
I don't know, Brain.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.605
May I suggest
looking behind you?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.417
It was just a suggestion.

19:20.225 --> 19:23.786
Maybe it just
spontaneously combusted?

19:23.862 --> 19:27.764
Oh, yeah, sure.
I've read about that in...

19:27.833 --> 19:30.358
Who am I kidding? I can't read!

19:56.061 --> 19:59.462
And just like that,
she was out of their lives.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.424
I did it. I...

20:03.001 --> 20:04.662
I created life.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.506
Has that hole always been there?

20:09.741 --> 20:11.003
Come on!

20:15.547 --> 20:16.571
Let me get this straight.

20:16.648 --> 20:19.947
We are chasing after
the bloodthirsty monster?

20:21.954 --> 20:23.615
"Home For Blind Orphans."

20:25.857 --> 20:28.792
Oh, God, she's killing blind orphans!

20:28.860 --> 20:32.421
That's so evil!
I mean, which is great, but...

20:33.732 --> 20:35.290
Blind orphans!

20:42.774 --> 20:43.968
I wanna go next!

20:45.177 --> 20:46.201
Me, me, pick me!

20:46.278 --> 20:49.076
I wonder what diabolical deed
she has planned next.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.136
Piggyback rides?

20:50.215 --> 20:52.274
- It's my turn!
- I wanna go next! I wanna go next!

20:52.351 --> 20:53.978
- Me! Me! Pick me!
- Me! Me!

20:54.052 --> 20:56.179
Blind orphans get everything!

20:56.588 --> 20:57.612
Ah!

20:57.689 --> 21:00.715
Your very large friend
is a sweetheart.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.282
No, she's not.

21:03.729 --> 21:05.219
I am your master,
and I command you

21:05.297 --> 21:07.663
to stop this gesture
of goodwill right now

21:07.733 --> 21:09.394
and put them down.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.295
Down!

21:13.505 --> 21:17.032
Okay, now you're gonna
march right back to the castle, got it?

21:18.477 --> 21:19.967
Oh, he's dead!

21:23.715 --> 21:27.082
Those are paper flowers the orphans sell.

21:27.152 --> 21:30.019
Sounds like someone likes them.

21:30.088 --> 21:31.680
You touch it, you buy it!

21:38.096 --> 21:39.188
Master!

21:39.264 --> 21:41.858
I looked inside
Dr. Glickenstein's castle

21:41.933 --> 21:43.332
and didn't see anyone.

21:43.402 --> 21:44.801
But that's not all...

21:44.870 --> 21:47.395
Yes, it is, because
your voice is annoying.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.667
Now to break into
Glickenstein's castle

21:49.741 --> 21:51.936
and steal the plans
like Heidi failed to do.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.948
What did this?

22:01.019 --> 22:05.547
I'm guessing something big.
Something like this.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.927
Life? Glickenstein invented life?

22:09.995 --> 22:12.896
I don't think he had a hand in it.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.233
Well, if he's toast,

22:16.835 --> 22:18.496
who invented that?

22:19.371 --> 22:20.395
I don't believe it.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.766
Wow,

22:22.841 --> 22:26.470
so not only is every other
Evil Scientist smarter than you,

22:26.545 --> 22:28.536
an Igor is, too?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.743
Ouch!

22:30.816 --> 22:33.284
Smart is not mouthing off

22:33.352 --> 22:38.153
to the man who has just found
his way to take the throne.

22:45.330 --> 22:48.959
<i>Oh, baby, won't you please come home?</i>

22:51.236 --> 22:53.204
<i>'Cause your little daddy's</i>
<i>gonna be all alone</i>

22:53.271 --> 22:56.934
She must be making a club
of flowers to smash us with.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.670
This must
be very embarrassing for you.

23:00.746 --> 23:03.044
<i>I never thought that we could part</i>

23:04.216 --> 23:08.880
<i>For every hour in the day</i>
<i>you can hear me say</i>

23:09.454 --> 23:12.617
<i>Baby, won't you please come home?</i>
<i>I need you, I need you</i>

23:12.691 --> 23:17.060
Okay, clearly her Evil Bone wasn't
activated when she came to life. That's it.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.629
Ooh! I have an idea!

23:18.697 --> 23:20.756
Is it about this situation?

23:21.133 --> 23:24.000
- No.
- Is it even an idea?

23:24.736 --> 23:26.727
Is French fries an idea?

23:29.374 --> 23:33.674
- So, how do you activate it?
- We need to kick-start it.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.940
We need to get her
to commit one act of evil.

23:37.115 --> 23:39.083
She wouldn't hurt a fly.

23:41.286 --> 23:42.776
Okay. Monster,

23:43.121 --> 23:45.248
I command you to kill that fly.

23:46.525 --> 23:48.789
Kill it! Kill it!

23:48.860 --> 23:51.488
Kill it, girl!
Come on! You're a killer!

23:51.563 --> 23:57.092
Maim it! Wound it! Insult it!
Something! Kill it! Kill it!

23:57.169 --> 23:58.796
Kill, kill, kill!

24:00.605 --> 24:02.197
You were saying?

24:09.681 --> 24:11.945
No, no, no! You're evil!

24:12.350 --> 24:13.647
Evil!

24:13.718 --> 24:14.844
Evil!

24:14.920 --> 24:16.012
E...

24:16.788 --> 24:17.846
Eva.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.954
What? No, you're not Eva.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.584
Eva. Eva.

24:24.696 --> 24:26.163
What now, genius?

24:26.231 --> 24:29.098
Well, thank you for asking.
What we're going to do...

24:29.167 --> 24:31.692
Go soak your brain, Brian.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.068
That's actually not a bad idea.

24:34.639 --> 24:35.833
Monster want a brain wash?

24:51.389 --> 24:53.516
- Next!
- Hi, I'd like to...

24:53.592 --> 24:57.494
Hey, who you talking to?
I'm the head guy here!

24:57.562 --> 24:59.120
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

24:59.197 --> 25:03.065
- What the heck is that?
- It's my Aunt Eva.

25:03.134 --> 25:04.931
She's getting a little
sweet in her old age,

25:05.003 --> 25:08.131
so I'd like to, I don't know,
evil her up a bit.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.768
"Sunday Night Massacre."
No. "Arsonist."

25:11.843 --> 25:13.538
Gee, they all look so good.

25:13.612 --> 25:15.807
How about the
"Axe Murderer" brain wash?

25:16.248 --> 25:19.115
Oh! She must be very special to you.

25:39.237 --> 25:42.900
Hey! Don't touch that!
It's a very complicated system!

25:42.974 --> 25:45.772
One wrong button and you'll
just be watching regular cable!

25:45.844 --> 25:49.371
You wanna waste your
nephew's money like that? Huh? Huh?

26:04.429 --> 26:08.695
Gosh, I feel like I'm sending my kid
off to school for the first time.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.233
You know, to learn how to murder.

26:12.103 --> 26:14.367
Hi. How are you? Great wings.

26:14.439 --> 26:17.101
Listen, could you squeeze
me in for a brain wash, too?

26:17.175 --> 26:19.143
A nice thorough scrubbing.

26:19.210 --> 26:20.700
What are you? An imbecile?

26:20.779 --> 26:24.237
Oh, <i>parlez</i> Italian?
<i>Taco grande</i> to meet you.

26:24.950 --> 26:28.215
Yeah. Take Brian to Room Number 4.

26:31.823 --> 26:33.415
"Wish you weren't there.

26:33.491 --> 26:37.894
"This card teleports your enemy to you
so you can destroy him in person."

26:37.963 --> 26:39.123
Call me old-fashioned,

26:39.197 --> 26:41.358
but what happened to cards
that just blew your head off?

26:41.433 --> 26:42.991
Just think, Scamper.
In a few short moments,

26:43.068 --> 26:46.333
I'm gonna have the most
Evil Invention of all time.

26:47.539 --> 26:50.508
It's my whole life savings,
but I think I'm going to treat myself.

26:53.178 --> 26:54.873
Oh, my hunch.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.511
"Happy Mother's Day."

27:01.553 --> 27:06.115
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Simple, elegant, classic.

27:06.925 --> 27:09.985
You've seen a lot of brains, I'm sure.

27:10.061 --> 27:12.894
Mine's bigger than average, right? No?

27:13.865 --> 27:16.231
Hello? Can you even talk?

27:18.637 --> 27:21.162
Canadians. I'll just watch TV.

27:22.607 --> 27:25.201
Whoops! Butterfingers.

27:27.879 --> 27:30.939
Oh. Great. Hold on.

27:31.016 --> 27:33.541
And it's cold,
it's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's cold.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.317
Hey, Monster, can I borrow your remote?

27:36.721 --> 27:38.052
Thank you.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.221
Oh, come on!

27:47.499 --> 27:49.831
<i>Let's do the twist</i>
<i>Around and around and around</i>

27:50.335 --> 27:51.359
Stupid remote!

27:51.803 --> 27:54.567
<i>To plumb the depths</i>
<i>of Blanche DuBois in</i> Streetcar

27:54.639 --> 27:58.200
<i>is the ultimate challenge</i>
<i>for any modern actress.</i>

28:03.615 --> 28:06.812
Well, our evil bun should
be out of the oven soon.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.526
Estephan, you're a magician!

28:18.596 --> 28:20.029
What's that smell?

28:20.098 --> 28:23.329
My new air freshener,
"Dead Dog." Jealous?

28:27.105 --> 28:28.970
I don't hear anything.

28:32.977 --> 28:34.638
I think it worked.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.476
Maybe they did too much?

28:37.549 --> 28:38.914
Oh. Was it?

28:38.983 --> 28:42.510
Was I too much?
I was pushing, wasn't I?

28:42.587 --> 28:45.147
It was only a vocal exercise,
but that is a beginner's mistake.

28:45.223 --> 28:48.158
I have to own that.
That's just where I am.

28:48.426 --> 28:52.123
If only I knew
whether I had the "it" factor.

28:52.197 --> 28:54.028
But how can you know?
I mean, you can't learn that,

28:54.099 --> 28:55.896
you just have to be born with it.

28:55.967 --> 28:59.630
Oh, listen to me going on
and on about me, me, me.

28:59.704 --> 29:02.696
Let's talk about you, Igor.
Do you think I have "it"?

29:02.774 --> 29:06.972
<i>Let's thank our guest who</i>
<i>has taught us in one hour,</i>

29:07.045 --> 29:11.106
<i>a lifetime worth of</i>
<i>lessons in acting.</i>

29:11.382 --> 29:12.576
Acting?

29:14.519 --> 29:16.316
Who changed the channel?

29:16.387 --> 29:17.581
Wait, where's the remote?

29:17.655 --> 29:19.589
Move it! I need this room.

29:19.657 --> 29:21.989
No, no, no! Wait!
We need to unbrainwash her!

29:22.060 --> 29:23.925
No can do, pal.

29:23.995 --> 29:27.692
Every wash comes with
a sealant guaranteed to last a lifetime.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.893
In other words, buzz off!

29:35.673 --> 29:38.403
Okay, things to do,
sign up for yoga classes,

29:38.476 --> 29:42.207
get new headshots,
adopt children from all over the world.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.215
Oh, time for my
elocution exercises.

29:45.550 --> 29:48.212
I need a box of biscuits.
I need a box of biscuits.

29:48.286 --> 29:53.019
- It's just failure after failure.
- After failure, after failure...

29:53.525 --> 29:55.823
Oh, sorry, I thought
we were counting off all your failures.

29:55.894 --> 29:58.385
Biscuit mixer, a box of mix...

29:58.463 --> 30:01.660
A box of mixed
biscuits and a biscuit mixer.

30:01.733 --> 30:02.995
I need a box...

30:03.067 --> 30:04.398
Stop the carriage!

30:05.570 --> 30:07.504
- Ow!
- What? What's the matter?

30:07.572 --> 30:10.769
I don't mean to be a prima donna,
but I think I need a bigger trailer.

30:10.842 --> 30:13.333
After failure,
after failure, after failure...

30:13.411 --> 30:16.039
After failure, after failure...

30:19.784 --> 30:22.582
That monster is about to be mine.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.645
Oh, really? How?

30:24.722 --> 30:28.818
Well, with a little something
I just stole for the occasion, okay?

30:32.197 --> 30:34.256
Practice poses
for the red carpet,

30:34.332 --> 30:38.200
become an environmentalist,
but still fly private when necessary.

30:41.806 --> 30:46.505
A Shrink Ray? Oh, that's a genius
plan for stealing a monster.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.512
Hey! I don't come
down to where you work and...

30:48.580 --> 30:51.879
Oh, that's right, you don't work!
So shut your cake hole, darling!

30:51.950 --> 30:55.147
Now, to shrink Igor
and steal his monster.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.821
Oh, God! Did I hit it?
Did I hit it? I hope I didn't hit it!

31:04.896 --> 31:08.059
You, sir, put the "Evil" in "Evil Scientist."

31:08.132 --> 31:09.360
Here we go!

31:11.135 --> 31:12.500
What the...

31:17.575 --> 31:20.043
Hold on! Pull over.
I'm getting jar sick!

31:20.111 --> 31:21.635
Someone's trying to shoot us!

31:21.713 --> 31:25.809
Paparazzi! Why can't
those vultures leave me alone?

31:29.954 --> 31:32.514
This has totally
ruined my spa day.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.228
To the right! To the right!

31:43.401 --> 31:46.131
This is the worst
car service I have ever used!

31:55.947 --> 31:57.380
Now I get to watch you die.

31:57.448 --> 31:58.540
Hold on!

32:07.992 --> 32:08.981
Brake. Brake!

32:09.060 --> 32:10.118
Uh-oh!

32:10.194 --> 32:11.593
Put the brake on, you...

32:15.466 --> 32:16.558
Okay.

32:18.169 --> 32:19.830
Fire the rocket booster!

32:20.305 --> 32:22.136
I can't see who it is!

32:22.206 --> 32:23.264
Here I come!

32:23.341 --> 32:25.400
Oh! My beautiful face.

32:26.878 --> 32:28.140
No more Doctor Don't Kill Anybody!

32:30.481 --> 32:33.882
We're not gonna make it!
We're not gonna make it!

32:37.722 --> 32:40.452
If only you'd
made yourself indestructible!

32:40.525 --> 32:42.459
Indestructible. Indestructible!

32:42.527 --> 32:44.017
Who wants to be a big movie star?

32:44.095 --> 32:45.995
Me! Me! I do.

33:02.013 --> 33:04.914
This would be the right time
to curb your suicidal tendencies.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.816
Hey.
I can see my room from here.

33:13.091 --> 33:15.389
Go away! Look,
I'm very important.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.655
Ew! What's that smell?

33:17.729 --> 33:22.029
Oh, yes, wait, it's the big,
whopping stench of failure.

33:22.100 --> 33:27.299
Ironically, at an inch tall, you still
have the biggest mouth in Malaria.

33:42.787 --> 33:45.221
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

33:45.723 --> 33:47.247
You saved my life.

33:47.325 --> 33:52.319
As an actor, I feel things
very deeply, and I treasure all of life.

33:56.901 --> 34:00.234
FYI, it's actually me you should thank.

34:00.304 --> 34:02.670
I was the one who changed
the channel on her brain wash.

34:02.740 --> 34:03.729
- What?
- Yep,

34:03.808 --> 34:06.902
and if she had been evil,
she would have let us all die.

34:06.978 --> 34:09.310
So technically,
I'm the one who saved us.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.574
But no need to thank me.

34:12.116 --> 34:13.981
Actually,
a "thank you" would be nice.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.818
It could be in the form of
a card or a poem, your choice.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.618
I also like ponies.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.418
An axe?

34:23.393 --> 34:25.885
I don't want an axe. That's crazy.
Why would you offer me an axe?

34:25.963 --> 34:29.694
You made my monster an actress!

34:29.766 --> 34:32.235
This is why people
are afraid of hunchbacks!

34:32.303 --> 34:33.668
This! Right here!

34:33.737 --> 34:35.295
Oh! What play are they rehearsing?

34:35.373 --> 34:36.533
<i>Brain-Dead.</i>

34:36.607 --> 34:38.507
- Don't let him kill me!
- It's gonna be a smash.

34:38.576 --> 34:39.770
Don't let him kill me!

34:43.147 --> 34:45.842
The only thing
killed here is my dream.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.844
Bravo! Bravo!

34:47.918 --> 34:48.943
Huh?

34:49.020 --> 34:51.351
Oh, you guys are so lucky to have work.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.880
If only I had a role I could
really sink my teeth into.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.454
Eva, you're in luck.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.519
In four days, there's
an audition for the lead

34:59.597 --> 35:02.896
in the biggest play
to hit Malaria since...

35:02.967 --> 35:05.231
<i>The Desperate Hunchback</i>
<i>Who Grasped at Straws?</i>

35:05.303 --> 35:07.863
Seriously, Eva,
this could be your big break!

35:07.939 --> 35:11.170
Oh, my gosh!
I don't believe it! What play is it?

35:11.242 --> 35:13.802
- Play? What play is it?
- Is it <i>Annie?</i>

35:14.579 --> 35:15.773
<i>Annie?</i>

35:15.847 --> 35:19.339
So many terrific girls
got their start playing Annie.

35:19.417 --> 35:23.820
- Yes, that's it! It's <i>Annie!</i>
- So it's actually a musical?

35:31.195 --> 35:34.323
- I think I just wet myself.
- Someone can sing!

35:34.732 --> 35:37.792
Gosh! Me trying out for <i>Annie,</i>

35:38.136 --> 35:42.402
the plucky orphan whose song of
hope lifts the heart of a weary nation?

35:42.473 --> 35:46.842
Yeah. Except in this version, Annie goes
nuts and battles a bunch of Evil Inventions

35:46.911 --> 35:51.610
- in deadly hand-to-hand combat.
- Wow. How avant-garde.

35:51.682 --> 35:54.981
Yeah. Trust me. You were
born to be in this production.

35:56.020 --> 36:01.515
<i>The sun'll come out tomorrow</i>

36:01.592 --> 36:02.650
<i>Bet your...</i>

36:02.727 --> 36:04.718
No, you missed it, again.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.496
Excuse me, Igor, but I think
you're supposed to say "cut."

36:08.566 --> 36:09.760
That's for film.

36:09.834 --> 36:10.858
Film?

36:10.935 --> 36:14.302
Can you imagine a face like
that on a 40-foot screen?

36:15.306 --> 36:17.297
All right, all right.
Now, listen, Eva...

36:17.375 --> 36:19.570
Excuse me, Igor,
I'm a little distracted.

36:19.644 --> 36:20.804
What?

36:20.878 --> 36:23.676
I think the makeup girl is out to get me.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.111
No, that's Brain. And he's not
the makeup girl, he's the idiot.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.678
Now, try to remember,
on the word "tomorrow,"

36:31.756 --> 36:35.351
you're supposed to crush
the Evil Invention to your left!

36:35.426 --> 36:37.223
You mean "stage left."

36:37.295 --> 36:40.492
Yeah, whatever. You're
supposed to smash it to smithereens.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.226
I know, it's just...

36:42.300 --> 36:45.861
It looks kind of real, and it's hard
because I would never hurt anything real.

36:45.937 --> 36:48.531
The props at the audition are
gonna look even more real, Eva.

36:48.606 --> 36:50.597
Some may even scream
when you smash them.

36:50.675 --> 36:51.801
Oh, really?

36:51.876 --> 36:54.777
Yes. And they're also
going to fight back.

36:54.845 --> 36:56.278
But it's all for reality's sake.

36:56.347 --> 36:57.871
But if you don't
want to be a real actress...

36:57.949 --> 37:00.008
Oh, no, no. I do, I do.

37:00.084 --> 37:02.416
This is a block for me,
but I will get through it.

37:02.486 --> 37:05.114
Once more,
from the top, with feeling.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.721
I just have a teeny,
teeny, tiny suggestion.

37:08.793 --> 37:12.024
Now, I know I'm not the director,
but at the end of the number,

37:12.096 --> 37:15.065
I would love to try
something like this...

37:15.132 --> 37:19.398
<i>You're only a day</i>

37:19.470 --> 37:23.270
<i>Away</i>

37:41.492 --> 37:42.754
Works for me.

37:49.133 --> 37:53.092
<i>Dr. Igor.</i>
<i>Dr. Igor von Igorstein.</i>

37:53.170 --> 37:57.038
<i>No, no, no. The Evil Reverend</i>
<i>Igor von Igorstein III.</i>

37:57.108 --> 38:00.942
<i>I can't believe it. I might</i>
<i>actually be able to pull this off.</i>

38:03.948 --> 38:06.746
Good work today, Eva.
You took some really

38:07.918 --> 38:09.249
big steps.

38:10.321 --> 38:12.016
Thank you, Igor.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.658
I'm whispering to protect my voice.

38:14.725 --> 38:17.455
I really couldn't have
done it without you.

38:18.262 --> 38:19.991
Isn't it beautiful?

38:20.564 --> 38:23.658
King Malbert has turned
this country into a paradise.

38:23.734 --> 38:27.864
His tower shines out for all the
world to see as a beacon of evil.

38:27.938 --> 38:29.735
And that's a good thing?

38:29.807 --> 38:32.037
We were a nothing country
until King Malbert taught us

38:32.109 --> 38:34.304
that the way to
succeed is by doing evil.

38:34.378 --> 38:37.142
Phew! This is a tough town.

38:37.214 --> 38:40.115
Well, in this world,
nice guys finish last.

38:40.785 --> 38:43.413
So, I have to step on
people to get ahead?

38:43.487 --> 38:44.511
Uh...

38:44.588 --> 38:45.680
Yeah.

38:45.756 --> 38:49.419
Well, I'd rather be a good
nobody than an evil somebody.

38:49.493 --> 38:52.428
And so would you.
Because you're good, Igor.

38:52.496 --> 38:53.554
Eva, don't say that.

38:53.631 --> 38:56.691
- It's true. You are good.
- Seriously, stop saying that!

38:56.767 --> 38:58.962
But you are!
You've helped me with my audition.

38:59.036 --> 39:01.334
You've made me
this delicious tea.

39:01.405 --> 39:02.702
You're a very good friend.

39:02.773 --> 39:04.468
Evil Scientists don't have friends.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.567
Well, what are Brain and Scamper?

39:06.644 --> 39:07.702
Headaches.

39:07.778 --> 39:08.802
Oh!

39:09.180 --> 39:10.772
Is that all I am?

39:10.848 --> 39:11.872
No.

39:11.949 --> 39:14.884
Okay. Then you can be
my number two friend.

39:14.952 --> 39:18.251
Number two friend.
Well, who's your number one friend?

39:18.322 --> 39:20.483
See? You're jealous.

39:20.991 --> 39:23.323
You do wanna be my friend.

39:24.128 --> 39:26.289
I guess I'm just a pushover.

39:28.065 --> 39:32.195
Hi, welcome to
<i>Cristall Clear.</i> I'm Carl Cristall.

39:32.703 --> 39:36.969
Tonight, we have a very special guest,
someone we all love and respect.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.908
It's Honkers the Gassy Monkey.
But first, King Malbert.

39:39.977 --> 39:42.445
You're not wearing any, you know, pants.

39:42.513 --> 39:44.981
Hmm? Oh, no, I'm not.

39:45.049 --> 39:48.109
I figure, why does
an invisible man need to wear pants?

39:48.185 --> 39:50.710
It's very liberating, Your Highness.

39:50.955 --> 39:52.923
Sire, the clouds,

39:52.990 --> 39:55.754
were they a blessing or a curse?

39:56.394 --> 39:59.989
Well, of course, I would never
wish the clouds on my people.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.862
But we rallied together
for the common good

40:02.933 --> 40:06.699
by embracing evil,
and look at us now!

40:06.771 --> 40:08.671
Respected, successful.

40:12.009 --> 40:14.273
- What are you doing?
- Scratching my invisible...

40:14.345 --> 40:16.540
But getting back to
my next question, sire.

40:16.614 --> 40:19.344
The Evil Science Fair
is two days away.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.750
Any predictions?
Can anyone beat Dr. Schadenfreude?

40:23.154 --> 40:25.122
Well, I hate to predict.

40:26.290 --> 40:30.124
I mean, all the Evil Scientists
are twisted fiends in their own right.

40:30.194 --> 40:34.563
That said, there may be a genius this year
with an Evil Invention so revolutionary

40:34.632 --> 40:37.999
that Schadenfreude might finally
get knocked off his perch!

40:38.068 --> 40:41.595
The only one getting
knocked off his perch is you!

40:41.906 --> 40:43.498
Damn it, I need that monster!

40:43.574 --> 40:44.939
I will not be beaten

40:45.009 --> 40:48.206
by a hunchbacked,
pot-bellied, bulgy-eyed runt.

40:48.712 --> 40:52.307
I think he's kind of cute.
Talent is attractive.

40:52.383 --> 40:55.216
I can just picture Igor
and his monster now,

40:55.286 --> 40:58.778
plotting their deadly
combat maneuvers.

41:01.892 --> 41:05.191
<i>I got a woman as big</i>
<i>as a house, yes, sir</i>

41:06.330 --> 41:09.766
<i>She's as big as a two-family</i>
<i>house with a porch and a fence</i>

41:09.934 --> 41:11.458
<i>You won't believe what you</i>
<i>see when you look at her</i>

41:14.605 --> 41:17.438
<i>She's enormous, colossal,</i>
<i>tremendous, gigantic, immense</i>

41:18.742 --> 41:22.269
<i>Why try to deny it?</i>
<i>She's just what I like</i>

41:22.346 --> 41:24.712
<i>If she goes on a diet</i>

41:25.583 --> 41:27.244
<i>I'll go on strike</i>

41:28.018 --> 41:29.849
<i>The bigger the figure</i>
<i>The better I like her</i>

41:29.920 --> 41:31.751
<i>The better I like her</i>
<i>The better I feed her</i>

41:31.822 --> 41:33.551
<i>The better I feed her</i>
<i>The bigger the figure</i>

41:33.624 --> 41:36.388
<i>The bigger the figure</i>
<i>The more I can love</i>

41:54.979 --> 41:58.676
<i>She's exactly like a watermelon</i>

41:59.216 --> 42:01.081
<i>Big and round and sweet</i>

42:02.419 --> 42:05.946
<i>And in a party dress</i>
<i>She may be quite a mess</i>

42:06.023 --> 42:08.651
<i>But I love her a lot</i>
<i>So what if she's not so neat?</i>

42:09.960 --> 42:11.621
<i>The bigger the figure</i>

42:11.896 --> 42:13.386
<i>The better I like her</i>

42:13.831 --> 42:15.298
<i>The better I like her</i>

42:15.599 --> 42:17.123
<i>The better I feed her</i>

42:17.468 --> 42:19.368
<i>The better I feed her</i>
<i>The bigger the figure</i>

42:19.436 --> 42:22.462
<i>The bigger the figure</i>
<i>The more I can love</i>

42:24.308 --> 42:25.969
<i>If she ever</i>

42:26.043 --> 42:27.908
<i>Eats me out of money</i>

42:28.379 --> 42:30.313
<i>And we needed the rent</i>

42:31.682 --> 42:35.083
<i>Oh, that'll be a cinch</i>
<i>'Cause when we're in a pinch</i>

42:35.152 --> 42:37.882
<i>I can put her to work</i>
<i>under a circus tent</i>

42:39.156 --> 42:41.056
<i>The bigger the figure</i>
<i>The better I like her</i>

42:41.125 --> 42:42.990
<i>The better I like her</i>
<i>The better I feed her</i>

42:43.060 --> 42:45.085
<i>The better I feed her</i>
<i>The bigger the figure</i>

42:45.162 --> 42:47.892
<i>The bigger the figure</i>
<i>The more I can love</i>

42:48.933 --> 42:51.163
Guys, can you come in here?

42:51.702 --> 42:53.567
I need to talk to you.

42:54.638 --> 42:58.301
If she's having a woman problem,
it's all yours.

43:14.425 --> 43:15.858
Ta-da!

43:16.193 --> 43:17.660
What are these?

43:17.728 --> 43:19.628
Opening night presents!

43:20.197 --> 43:22.256
I know it's technically
just an audition tomorrow,

43:22.333 --> 43:23.595
but I figured, "What the hey?"

43:23.667 --> 43:26.727
They're not much, since I had to
use stuff I found around here,

43:26.804 --> 43:29.102
but, well...
You first, Brain!

43:29.173 --> 43:32.904
An envelope!
You spoil me rotten, lady.

43:32.977 --> 43:35.002
I think we better open it.

43:35.713 --> 43:37.681
It's a new label for your jar.

43:38.849 --> 43:40.976
And Brain is spelled right!

43:41.852 --> 43:43.217
It is, right?

43:43.287 --> 43:45.448
You shouldn't really
worry about labels, though,

43:45.522 --> 43:47.854
because you may be a brain,
but you have heart.

43:49.059 --> 43:51.220
And in some ways,
that's more important.

43:51.295 --> 43:54.128
Heart? I'd kill for a pair of feet.

43:55.432 --> 43:59.300
Open yours, Scamper.
It's a prehistoric evergreen.

43:59.370 --> 44:01.930
They live forever.
I just want to make sure

44:02.006 --> 44:04.372
that if anything ever
happens to the three of us,

44:04.441 --> 44:05.669
you always have company.

44:05.743 --> 44:08.803
Great.
I must be allergic to it.

44:08.879 --> 44:12.508
With any luck, it'll kill me
with its dinosaur-era toxins.

44:13.517 --> 44:15.576
Can we move on to Igor now?

44:17.021 --> 44:19.512
No one's ever given me a gift before.

44:19.590 --> 44:22.423
It's something
no director can be without.

44:23.627 --> 44:24.889
A beret!

44:27.698 --> 44:28.687
Voilà!

44:28.766 --> 44:30.063
That's French for,

44:30.134 --> 44:32.898
"Please stop pelting me and
my ridiculous hat with rocks."

44:32.970 --> 44:35.530
Hey, Igor, where's our gift for Eva?

44:35.906 --> 44:38.898
- Our gift?
- Oh! You guys didn't.

44:38.976 --> 44:40.170
We did.

44:41.078 --> 44:43.103
Where'd you put it, Igor?

44:43.247 --> 44:46.216
It's in the other room.

44:49.553 --> 44:52.351
Gift, gift, gift, gift.

44:58.462 --> 45:01.363
Eva. Well, we got you this.

45:02.633 --> 45:04.225
It's a necklace.

45:12.276 --> 45:15.211
It's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen!

45:16.680 --> 45:18.272
Igor, can you...

45:18.348 --> 45:20.543
I would do it myself,
but I am all thumbs.

45:20.617 --> 45:23.984
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I got the thumbs on sale.

45:24.922 --> 45:26.116
I'm never gonna take this off.

45:26.190 --> 45:29.626
That way all of you will be
close to my heart forever.

45:31.729 --> 45:35.290
I need to go write this down
in my sense-memory journal!

45:35.566 --> 45:37.557
Oh, where did I put my glitter pen?

45:39.903 --> 45:42.235
See, this is the kind of
moment that'd be tough

45:42.306 --> 45:45.537
for someone who wasn't
meant to be an Evil Scientist.

45:45.609 --> 45:49.272
Somebody who'd go all soft
and want to tell her the truth.

45:50.547 --> 45:53.107
But lucky for us, I'm evil, right?

45:53.183 --> 45:54.946
Yeah. Lucky us.

45:55.953 --> 45:57.682
I don't feel lucky.

46:07.998 --> 46:10.933
So we stay on track,
'cause we're almost there,

46:11.001 --> 46:13.834
and I just don't let
her get into my head.

46:19.243 --> 46:21.302
It's so hard being
a little hunchback.

46:21.378 --> 46:22.572
Heidi!

46:22.646 --> 46:25.547
Dr. Glickenstein is under the rug.
I mean, under the weather.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.641
I didn't come to see him.

46:28.218 --> 46:30.482
I came to see you.

46:31.221 --> 46:32.279
Me?

46:39.163 --> 46:43.122
By the way, an Igor came by today

46:43.200 --> 46:45.998
and asked me to
hands-deliver this to you.

46:46.436 --> 46:48.301
And these are my hands.

46:49.406 --> 46:52.398
- What? What is it?
<i>- Ja,</i> I haven't any idea.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.103
"Wish You Weren't There."

46:59.383 --> 47:04.821
Oh, excellent, wonderful.
You got my card.

47:08.091 --> 47:09.080
Is everything okay?

47:10.227 --> 47:11.216
I heard a strange noise.

47:11.295 --> 47:12.319
Ooh!

47:12.396 --> 47:14.796
Oh, I wasn't at the door
listening to you and Igor.

47:14.865 --> 47:16.162
I just...

47:17.167 --> 47:20.261
Hi! We haven't met. I'm Eva.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.905
Oh, you're upset, aren't you?

47:24.975 --> 47:27.967
"Who is this strange woman
living with Igor," right?

47:28.045 --> 47:30.741
Well, believe me,
Igor and I are just friends.

47:30.814 --> 47:33.476
As his girlfriend,
you have nothing to worry about.

47:33.550 --> 47:36.576
- I'm not his girlfriend.
- You're not?

47:36.653 --> 47:38.814
But the way he looks at you.

47:39.423 --> 47:40.822
He never looks at me that way.

47:40.891 --> 47:42.984
Maybe some men like girls

47:43.060 --> 47:46.928
who don't look like they've
been put together at the junkyard.

47:48.565 --> 47:49.657
Right.

47:49.733 --> 47:52.497
You have a very ugly face.

47:54.304 --> 47:57.000
Well, I have to go get
some rest for my audition tomorrow.

47:58.175 --> 47:59.870
It was nice meeting you. Oh.

47:59.943 --> 48:02.241
Whoops!

48:04.147 --> 48:05.444
Audition?

48:10.954 --> 48:13.616
So, how's your cocktail, Igor?

48:13.690 --> 48:15.715
Is it nice? You like it?

48:15.792 --> 48:18.886
Is it coconut-ty?
Coconut-ty enough?

48:18.962 --> 48:22.090
Wait! You should be sipping in style!

48:22.633 --> 48:24.794
Igor! Krazy Straw! Right now!

48:27.871 --> 48:30.704
Small trumpet. Isn't that better?
Doesn't that taste better?

48:30.774 --> 48:31.798
Excuse me, sir, but why...

48:33.410 --> 48:35.275
I mean, why am I here?

48:35.345 --> 48:37.245
You can drop that slur around me.

48:37.314 --> 48:40.442
I don't even make my Igors talk
that way. Isn't that right, Igor?

48:40.517 --> 48:44.248
Oh, that's right, Master.

48:44.321 --> 48:46.084
How many times do I have to tell you?

48:46.156 --> 48:48.647
Call me Frederick.
Okay? That's my name.

48:48.725 --> 48:50.659
Okay. Frederick!

48:51.361 --> 48:54.091
I have to get back.
Dr. Glickenstein will be missing me.

48:54.164 --> 48:58.533
Somehow, I think he's missing
more than his right-hand man.

48:59.703 --> 49:04.663
Look, Iggy baby, I know all about
Glickenstein and his deadness.

49:05.842 --> 49:08.106
I also know about your monster.

49:08.979 --> 49:10.537
I'm gonna guess your plan.

49:10.614 --> 49:14.914
You win the Evil Science Fair, and then
everyone looks past the hunch thing,

49:14.985 --> 49:16.919
and they accept you for the real you.

49:16.987 --> 49:19.683
You grab the girl of your dreams
and you cha-cha-cha your way

49:19.756 --> 49:22.054
to a happy ending.
Am I close on this?

49:22.125 --> 49:23.592
No, not entirely.

49:25.095 --> 49:26.528
I don't know how to cha-cha.

49:27.230 --> 49:29.721
We're a lot alike, Igor.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.893
I want to be more as well,

49:31.969 --> 49:34.460
but society, it won't let me. It stops me.

49:34.538 --> 49:35.630
So, this is my plan.

49:35.706 --> 49:38.937
I enter Evil Science Fair
with your monster and then I win.

49:39.009 --> 49:41.204
I turn the monster on the King.

49:41.278 --> 49:44.839
Ding dong, the King is dead,
long live the new king, me!

49:46.917 --> 49:52.617
And then you come in as
Malaria's new Evil Scientist, Dr. Igor.

49:53.290 --> 49:55.724
So what do you say to that?
Is that nice? Is that really nice?

49:55.792 --> 49:57.692
You want to overthrow the King?

49:57.761 --> 50:00.195
I thought you wanted
to be an Evil Scientist.

50:00.263 --> 50:01.252
I do. But...

50:01.331 --> 50:03.060
Stop thinking like an Igor!

50:03.133 --> 50:06.466
Evil Scientists do not let
anyone stand in their way.

50:07.137 --> 50:09.401
Yes. I know. They step
on people to get ahead.

50:09.473 --> 50:10.667
Exactly!

50:11.575 --> 50:13.668
- She'll never do it.
- She?

50:13.744 --> 50:14.972
The monster. She isn't evil.

50:15.045 --> 50:17.639
Something went wrong and her
Evil Bone was never activated.

50:17.714 --> 50:20.979
So how do we get this
Evil Bone up and running, huh?

50:21.051 --> 50:25.010
We kick it, we slap it,
we take it to the movies, call it Irene?

50:25.522 --> 50:28.650
She needs to commit an evil act,
but since she's not evil, she won't.

50:30.861 --> 50:32.351
Well, your troubles are over then,

50:32.429 --> 50:35.887
because I can get a woman
to do absolutely anything.

50:36.466 --> 50:37.524
I don't know.

50:37.601 --> 50:41.059
Don't tell me that you have
feelings for this thing?

50:41.138 --> 50:42.537
- No.
- Good,

50:43.240 --> 50:45.640
because that would be pathetic.

50:46.510 --> 50:51.140
I can give you everything
you have ever wanted.

50:51.615 --> 50:52.673
I think I need to go.

50:52.749 --> 50:55.309
Look, the Evil Science Fair
is in a few hours.

50:55.385 --> 50:58.320
You're either with me or against me.

50:58.388 --> 51:00.583
Yes or no?

51:04.327 --> 51:06.022
I take that as a no.

51:07.497 --> 51:08.794
What are you going
to do now, smart guy?

51:24.548 --> 51:25.845
Oh!

51:29.019 --> 51:30.145
No!

51:31.988 --> 51:33.580
Frederick!

51:35.292 --> 51:37.157
Frederick! Why are you swimming?

51:37.227 --> 51:38.922
You just ate 10 minutes ago.

51:38.995 --> 51:40.724
Get off of me, you buffoon!

52:11.228 --> 52:13.059
Okay,
we finished your costume.

52:13.130 --> 52:15.462
I just hope it's
cinched enough at the waist.

52:15.532 --> 52:17.796
Obviously, if I had more time,
I would have made it flare out

52:17.868 --> 52:19.165
a little bit more over the knees.

52:19.236 --> 52:22.433
Stop touching it, Brain,
I'm creating a look here.

52:23.406 --> 52:26.569
You guys are my friends.
So, you'll tell me the truth, right?

52:26.643 --> 52:28.270
Yeah, sure.

52:29.246 --> 52:31.680
Do you think I'm pretty?

52:34.284 --> 52:38.311
Brain, get me a tub of
eye-liner, a pound of lipstick,

52:38.388 --> 52:42.154
and if all else fails,
the severed head of a supermodel.

52:42.225 --> 52:44.557
Okay, the Jacuzzi is not a bathroom.

52:44.628 --> 52:45.890
I know that now.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.860
Please, please, take your own
sweet time! I'm loving it here!

52:49.933 --> 52:51.423
Oh, really?

52:51.501 --> 52:53.366
Well, then maybe you
should stay down there

52:53.436 --> 52:55.996
with your Igor, poopshkin!

52:56.072 --> 52:58.302
You know something?
He's a good listener,

52:58.375 --> 53:02.436
he's got soft hands, and unlike you,
he sometimes shaves his legs!

53:11.888 --> 53:15.449
Wait. No kissing Heidi.

53:18.061 --> 53:20.825
Or do you like me better as Heidi?

53:20.964 --> 53:23.865
Hmm. Jaclyn, Heidi,
Jaclyn, Heidi.

53:25.168 --> 53:26.362
It would be really swell

53:26.436 --> 53:29.030
if you didn't go psycho-girlfriend
on me right now.

53:29.105 --> 53:32.131
- I'm not psycho!
- Obviously not.

53:32.209 --> 53:37.545
How would you feel if every day
you had to be 13 different people?

53:37.614 --> 53:40.208
I'm Jaclyn, your girlfriend.

53:42.953 --> 53:45.854
Then I'm Dr. Nachtmahr's girlfriend.

53:46.756 --> 53:49.384
Then I'm Dr. Groaner's girlfriend.

53:49.459 --> 53:51.086
All for you!

53:51.161 --> 53:54.528
To help you steal
inventions year after year!

53:54.598 --> 53:58.898
And I still say those stolen
pills were the best invention yet.

53:58.969 --> 54:01.836
Well, this time
they really paid off.

54:01.905 --> 54:04.806
Guess what Mommy found out
about our favorite little monster?

54:04.874 --> 54:06.398
Or should I say actress?

54:06.476 --> 54:07.465
Oh.

54:10.380 --> 54:11.540
Eva!

54:15.785 --> 54:18.049
Eva! Eva!

54:22.759 --> 54:26.456
Just breathe. Okay.
Center yourself on the body.

54:34.204 --> 54:37.139
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. Director.

54:44.114 --> 54:47.777
Oh, no, this isn't happening.
Act graceful. Act graceful.

54:47.851 --> 54:48.909
Keep smiling.

54:54.858 --> 54:56.257
Too close?

54:56.760 --> 54:59.888
No. Eva, you look...
You look beautiful.

55:00.630 --> 55:02.325
Oh, this is such a cliché,

55:02.399 --> 55:05.800
the leading lady
falling for her director.

55:06.236 --> 55:08.932
Well, you're not
used to high heels.

55:10.573 --> 55:12.131
Oh, you mean...

55:12.742 --> 55:14.505
Our work here is done.

55:14.577 --> 55:15.805
Our work?

55:15.879 --> 55:19.076
You spent the entire time
playing with a piece of ribbon.

55:23.953 --> 55:27.480
Eva, about the audition, I think
I've given you the wrong direction.

55:27.557 --> 55:30.253
But I feel so prepared.

55:30.327 --> 55:34.627
No, I've been trying to make you
play a role that you're not right for.

55:34.698 --> 55:36.928
- What?
- I have to tell you the truth.

55:39.969 --> 55:42.665
Heidi.
I'll just be a minute.

55:45.175 --> 55:49.475
Oh, Igor. Ow! My ankle.

55:49.546 --> 55:52.481
It twisted like the pretzel, Igor!

55:54.017 --> 55:55.575
Enchanting.

55:55.652 --> 55:58.280
Thank you. And who are you?

55:58.822 --> 56:03.919
Someone who does not want
your unique gifts to go to waste.

56:05.095 --> 56:06.619
Are you a talent agent?

56:06.996 --> 56:10.227
I was so deep down worried

56:10.300 --> 56:14.236
that when you opened the card,
I thought I lost you forever.

56:14.304 --> 56:16.363
Heidi, I need to tell you something.

56:16.439 --> 56:17.929
I don't know what it is,

56:18.007 --> 56:21.238
but I feel like for
the first time in my life,

56:21.311 --> 56:24.508
I'm seeing a real Igor.

56:25.281 --> 56:28.182
And I think I'm in love with him.

56:32.322 --> 56:34.950
Wow, when it rains, it pours.

56:35.959 --> 56:36.948
No, no.

56:37.026 --> 56:39.620
Igor is a liar. He does this...

56:39.696 --> 56:42.824
Igor would never lie to me.
Igor cares about me.

56:42.899 --> 56:45.060
Cares? He doesn't care.

56:45.135 --> 56:48.104
Because he built you to be a weapon.

56:48.171 --> 56:50.662
No, no, no, you're wrong.

56:50.740 --> 56:53.174
He'll never look at you and see a woman.

56:53.243 --> 56:56.212
All he will ever see is a monster.

56:56.279 --> 56:58.247
I don't believe you.

56:58.314 --> 57:00.214
Open your eyes.

57:00.283 --> 57:04.014
Igor has someone
else in mind for your role.

57:04.087 --> 57:05.611
Heidi, no!

57:08.858 --> 57:10.621
There's nothing more for you here.

57:10.693 --> 57:14.891
Come with me.
I will make you a star.

57:34.150 --> 57:35.344
No.

57:37.053 --> 57:38.077
Oh!

57:38.154 --> 57:39.519
What's wrong?

57:39.589 --> 57:42.319
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I've made someone else.

57:42.392 --> 57:43.416
Huh?

57:43.493 --> 57:47.156
I mean, I've met someone else,
who I made. It's complicated.

57:47.230 --> 57:50.529
Wait a minute.
You're rejecting me?

57:50.600 --> 57:54.434
- I'm sorry.
- For that big bumpy thing?

57:55.505 --> 57:56.529
How do you know about...

57:56.606 --> 58:02.306
I mean, this isn't even the sexiest
me, but come on! Look at you.

58:02.378 --> 58:09.307
You're hideous. You really are.
And I kissed you! Ugh! Yuck!

58:09.385 --> 58:10.477
Um...

58:13.523 --> 58:14.922
You're a monster.

58:14.991 --> 58:18.688
And as we know,
monsters only exist to be used.

58:22.165 --> 58:23.359
Schadenfreude!

58:24.234 --> 58:25.462
Eva!

58:31.508 --> 58:32.941
Seize him!

58:34.010 --> 58:36.001
Where's Glickenstein?

58:36.079 --> 58:41.142
And before you answer, you should
know that someone sent me this!

58:42.585 --> 58:45.349
Your Highness, he's dead.

58:45.421 --> 58:47.889
And he didn't invent life, did he?

58:48.157 --> 58:49.181
No.

58:50.360 --> 58:51.554
I did.

58:53.296 --> 58:54.888
An Igor inventing...

58:54.964 --> 58:55.988
Silence!

58:56.499 --> 58:58.660
Hunchy invented life, eh?

58:58.735 --> 59:00.464
Well, where is it?

59:00.537 --> 59:03.233
It's a she, and I think someone's taken her.

59:03.306 --> 59:08.471
Well, if she comes back,
we'll just tell her where to find you.

59:08.545 --> 59:11.514
In the Igor recycling plant!

59:11.581 --> 59:14.948
No! Please! No! No!

59:16.719 --> 59:18.550
Eva, where are you?

59:20.323 --> 59:22.621
Eva!

59:32.201 --> 59:35.136
Eva!

59:56.793 --> 59:59.591
<i>Lock your doors</i>
<i>and hide your loved ones.</i>

59:59.662 --> 01:00:03.325
<i>It's the annual Evil Science Fair!</i>

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:07.096
I'm Carl Cristall
and I'm coming to you live, invisible

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.195
and totally au naturel!

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:14.968
<i>Fans are taking their seats,</i>
<i>including King Malbert himself!</i>

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:16.978
Don't touch me!

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:19.173
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>the scientists are in their locker rooms,</i>

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.546
<i>prepping their Evil Inventions!</i>

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:41.567
Here we are.
A dressing room fit for a leading lady.

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:44.536
Wow, listen to that.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.701
How many girls
are auditioning for this project?

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.514
I'm gonna go save him.

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:02.580
Wait.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.650
Look, maybe I'm not a genius, okay.

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:08.356
But I know one thing,
I have to try.

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:11.559
No, I was gonna say,
"Wait, I'm coming with you."

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:15.036
On three.

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:16.930
One.

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:18.673
Hey! No fair!

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:30.382
- What are you doing here?
- We're here to rescue you!

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:37.589
I don't want to be rescued. I'm an Igor.
And this is what happens to us.

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:43.394
Figures, just when
I decided I want to live...

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.030
Don't peek.

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:51.664
Don't worry.

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:56.242
I hope I can still do a decent
audition without Igor's help.

01:01:56.312 --> 01:02:00.976
Trust me, I'm the one who's
gonna bring out the real you.

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.283
This isn't you, Igor.

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:07.754
Where is all that stupid
optimism and annoying can-do attitude?

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:10.054
I tried to be someone different,
but the world wouldn't let me.

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:15.359
Don't you want to go after Eva
and save her from Schadenfreude?

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:17.922
Are you actually trying
to hypnotize me, Brain?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.230
Yes!

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:23.363
But if that's not working,
then how about this?

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:24.463
Ow!

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:27.439
Eva needs you and
you're the only hunchback

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:30.138
that can stand tall and fight for her.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:34.811
Brain, that may be
the smartest thing you've ever said.

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:37.711
Reach, Brain! Reach!

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:40.981
You should have
built me with a longer arm.

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.327
- Huh?
- Huh?

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:50.229
What? Like this is the first time
I've gnawed my own feet off.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.628
Who says rabbits' feet are lucky?

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:01.142
Wheels, don't fail me now!

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:07.244
Wheels failed me!
Wheels failed me!

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:15.819
We went that way!

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:20.928
What are you doing?

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:23.932
Looking for the secret passage!
There's always a secret passage!

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.935
Darn it, Brain,
there's no secret passage!

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:28.368
It's over.

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.845
I'm sorry, you were saying?

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:39.473
Technically,
it's a secret staircase.

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:49.056
<i>Welcome! To you and the</i>
<i>millions of viewers around the globe!</i>

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:52.856
<i>They come from all corners.</i>
<i>And just look at them.</i>

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:56.695
<i>They're all worried sick</i>
<i>about one thing, world peace.</i>

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:59.360
<i>Well, tonight,</i>
<i>it's within their grasp.</i>

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:05.135
<i>And it has but a small price,</i>
<i>and that price is $100 billion.</i>

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:12.776
And I, for one,
I think they can do it.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.441
And if they don't, well,

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:17.543
the Evil Invention last standing
will be unleashed on the world.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.680
Ah! It'd just be too horrible to imagine.

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:33.200
Where are we?

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.594
And why am I panting?

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:36.968
I don't have lungs.

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:40.805
The tower of the King's castle.
Look, there's the Killiseum.

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:47.377
Wow, I don't know
what it is, but I want one!

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:51.415
It's the beacon of evil
on top of the royal castle.

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:54.684
Wait. Is it a beacon?

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:58.921
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:01.152
And bring me back a toy!

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:41.294
Ah!

01:05:57.286 --> 01:06:00.551
The King's beacon is
really a weather ray.

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:04.422
King Malbert is making
the storm clouds.

01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:10.164
<i>So, citizens</i>
<i>of the world, I beseech you...</i>

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:12.223
- He lied to us.
<i>...call the number</i>

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:13.290
<i>on the bottom of your screens.</i>

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:17.601
<i>Yes, right there. You need to give,</i>
<i>just like we need to be evil.</i>

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.731
You need to be evil.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.505
I know my choreography,
if that's what you mean.

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:27.015
I think you need to go deeper.
Have you ever done anything evil?

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:28.973
No.

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:30.382
Well, then how can
you play it truthfully?

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.978
You know you can't
get this part if you fake it.

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:34.215
Hit me.

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:35.951
- What?
- Hit me.

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:37.720
I could never hit anyone.

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:39.693
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:42.754
Igor was right. You are not an actress.

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:43.856
Yes, I am.

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:46.367
Oh, no, you're not.
No wonder he chose Heidi.

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:49.404
I mean, you know,
she's beautiful and you are not.

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.133
She has got talent and you do not.

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.265
Don't you say that.

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:54.935
Look at you. You are pathetic!

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.308
No, I'm not!

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:58.472
Yes, you are!
You're just a big, freaky...

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:00.572
And here it is, baby.
Buckle up, here it comes.

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:04.085
You are an ugly monster!
You couldn't act your way out of a...

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:05.211
Ah!

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:26.369
We've got Annie!

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:32.376
Malarians, let's get evil!

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:57.765
What? You're gonna
lower yourself down?

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.808
You've got your job,
I've got mine.

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:01.172
I'm coming, Eva!

01:08:02.044 --> 01:08:03.875
And bring me back a toy!

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:24.330
Phew! That was close.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:27.934
He's okay! He's...

01:08:29.537 --> 01:08:30.562
Oh!

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:36.569
I'm coming, Eva.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.640
Pull the switch!

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:47.912
<i>And here comes</i>
<i>this year's Evil Inventions!</i>

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:21.920
<i>What a menagerie</i>
<i>of mayhem-loving monstrosities.</i>

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:31.624
<i>Take a good look, world,</i>
<i>any of these could be coming for you!</i>

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:35.229
<i>Only one Evil Invention left.</i>

01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:39.796
Time for my crowning achievement.

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:41.365
Pull the switch!

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.995
That's Dr. Schadenfreude's
invention?

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:11.371
Eva?

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:14.399
Let the battle begin!

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:15.704
No.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:24.213
<i>The sun'll come out</i>

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:27.653
<i>Tomorrow</i>

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:30.021
<i>Hold on!</i>
<i>What's this? It's fighting.</i>

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:35.962
<i>Bet your bottom dollar</i>
<i>that tomorrow</i>

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:37.521
<i>And winning!</i>

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:42.037
<i>There'll be sun!</i>

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:44.436
Let me through!
Let me through! I made her!

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:45.803
You made her?

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:48.741
Hey, here's
the genius Igor that made her!

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:52.440
<i>Just thinking about</i>

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:55.381
<i>Tomorrow</i>

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:59.888
<i>Clears away the cobwebs</i>

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:02.924
<i>And the sorrow</i>

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:07.952
<i>Till there's none</i>

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:13.296
Eva! Eva!

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:19.296
<i>And wait!</i>
<i>An Igor has entered the arena.</i>

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:22.902
<i>I just stick out my chin and grin</i>

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.538
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>folks, he'll be dead soon.</i>

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:30.478
<i>Oh!</i>

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:35.422
She's almost at her big finish!

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:39.222
And if we don't destroy
this weather ray, it's really over.

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:54.172
<i>The sun'll come out tomorrow</i>

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:55.710
<i>So you gotta hang on</i>

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:57.678
<i>Leave it to Schadenfreude,</i>

01:11:57.746 --> 01:12:01.876
<i>destroying his enemies</i>
<i>with a giant girl in a red dress.</i>

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:06.452
I can't believe
Schadenfreude did it again!

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:10.184
What are you doing
in the King's box, Schoddy?

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:13.490
I was about to ask you
the same question, Malby.

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:15.826
Malby? What's the meaning of this?

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:19.664
This means you're through.
Or should I say "overthrown"?

01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:26.203
Hey, you unhand him.

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:28.071
He's your new king.

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:30.711
And if you have
a problem with that,

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:33.043
please take it up with the
head of my complaint department,

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:34.480
who's the big monster over there.

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:38.375
Majesty.

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:42.618
There's gotta be a faster
way to demolish this thing!

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.558
We're all going to die! Except you!

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:46.889
Oh, yeah!

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:04.109
<i>Tomorrow</i>

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:08.710
<i>Tomorrow</i>

01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:11.048
<i>I love ya</i>

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:13.278
<i>Tomorrow</i>

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:15.550
She's going to take
this whole place apart.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:22.459
<i>You're always a day...</i>

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:26.733
Wait! This isn't you.

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.964
I did create you to be evil.

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:34.202
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I lied to you about everything.

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:38.973
It's just a role.
You don't have to play it.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:44.743
Yes, she does! You're an Igor.
She's an Evil Invention!

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.653
No. Everyone has
an Evil Bone in their body,

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:50.089
but we choose
whether or not to use it.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.092
And as someone I love once said,

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:58.757
"It's better to be a good
nobody than an evil somebody."

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:32.624
I'm not evil.

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:36.427
I'm Eva.

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:39.832
That is the correct answer.

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:43.742
Igor, I felt like I was
in a dark, horrible place.

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:45.774
We all were.

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:48.180
Wait! What's happening?

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:51.411
The end of Malaria's
evil role in the world.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.920
Camera 2!

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:56.685
<i>Oh! Excellent. Thank you!</i>

01:14:57.359 --> 01:15:00.021
<i>For generations, King Malbert</i>
<i>has kept us in the dark</i>

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:03.792
<i>by creating the clouds</i>
<i>with a weather ray!</i>

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:05.333
<i>He lied to us!</i>

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:07.794
<i>We trusted him</i>
<i>and he lied to us.</i>

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:11.772
<i>He tricked us into thinking</i>
<i>we needed to be evil to survive!</i>

01:15:12.274 --> 01:15:13.866
<i>But we don't!</i>

01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:17.301
None of us do.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.014
This is outrageous! He has no proof!

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:27.112
Where's his proof?
I demand to see proof!

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.852
I demand to see...

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:37.459
Oops!

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:40.259
I'm sure he's fine.

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:43.236
Long live King Schadenfreude!
Everybody!

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:45.239
King Malbert the liar is dead!

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:47.901
Long live King Schadenfreude!

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:49.603
Everybody say, "Long live..."

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:55.808
Well, that was a short reign.

01:15:56.351 --> 01:15:59.548
Hey, fellas, I'm single again!

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:02.716
No more pills.

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:07.022
They can't see what I really look like.

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.861
My evil days are over!

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:14.767
From here on out,
all evil doings will be handled

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:17.771
by my manager /boyfriend.

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:28.040
Igor! Igor! Igor!

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:33.520
Igor! Igor! Igor!

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.991
President Igor,
now that you're in charge,

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:48.230
will pants continue to be as
expensive and uncomfortable

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:50.737
as they were under the
previous administration?

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:53.604
What? What? No.
Everything is about pants.

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:56.667
Why is everything
about pants with you?

01:16:56.745 --> 01:16:59.339
There you have it.
Another politician afraid to answer

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:01.814
the tough, pants-related
questions of Carl Cristall.

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:09.480
Pickles. Old family recipe. Pickles.

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:12.721
Cocoas! Strudel!

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:16.494
Mmm-hmm!

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:17.691
Yuck!

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:23.637
Pick me up at 7:00.
I'm gonna go home and shave.

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:29.209
Hey, Scamper, have you seen Eva?

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:31.040
No. Go away.

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:34.844
Hans, you're wearing this backwards.
What are you? Blind?

01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:37.812
Let's switch this around.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.913
So, what do you do?

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:44.186
I'm a genius.
What do you do, mister?

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:47.752
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:50.320
I left your opening
night gift back at the lab.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:52.924
Oh, my necklace!

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.525
Look inside.

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:00.564
Oh, my gosh.

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:02.473
You're really gonna make this?

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:06.071
Yeah. And if it doesn't
work out, then we'll just adopt.

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:12.052
It's a big step,
getting a pet together.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.645
Come on, after living
with Brain and Scamper,

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:17.248
everything will
seem like a breeze.

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:31.165
<i>I can see clearly now the rain has gone</i>

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:39.172
<i>I can see all obstacles in my way</i>

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:47.144
<i>Gone are the dark clouds</i>
<i>that had me blind</i>

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:53.953
<i>It's going to be a bright,</i>
<i>bright sunshiny day</i>

01:18:55.864 --> 01:19:01.928

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:09.036
<i>It's going to be a bright,</i>

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:11.803
<i>I got a pocket</i>
<i>Got a pocket full of sunshine</i>

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.973
<i>I got a love and I know</i>

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:16.483
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:20.445

<i>But you never gonna break me</i>

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:22.683
<i>Sticks and stones are</i>
<i>never gonna shake me</i>

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:25.226
