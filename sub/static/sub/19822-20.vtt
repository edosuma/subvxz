00:11.178 --> 00:13.245
<i>to the Hunter house...</i>

00:13.314 --> 00:17.049
<i>or you'll never see your
brother and sister again.</i>

00:17.118 --> 00:18.550
You think you're so tough?

00:18.619 --> 00:20.386
Why don't you meet me
face-to-face, okay?

00:20.454 --> 00:21.987
I'll wipe the floor with you, man.
I'll...

(Sal) Poor Daniel.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.292
Poor Nika.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.094
This is your fault.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.195
None of this would have
happened if you hadn't

00:30.264 --> 00:31.497
stolen that letter and
given it to your father.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.532
I was just trying to help.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.667
And now that my father knows
that I wasn't on his...

00:35.736 --> 00:37.603
That was your plan the
whole time, wasn't it?

00:38.873 --> 00:40.706
Get away from your monster of a father

00:40.775 --> 00:42.141
and move in here with us?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.842
What are you trying to do, replace me?

00:43.911 --> 00:47.312
No one could ever replace you.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.614
Mom... Hi!

00:48.682 --> 00:50.482
Hi, honey! Mwah!

00:50.551 --> 00:51.717
I missed you so much. I missed you too!

00:51.786 --> 00:53.719

00:53.788 --> 00:57.289
Max... no one could replace you.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.024
Not ever.

Come here, please.

01:04.899 --> 01:05.831
Mm!

01:07.868 --> 01:10.335
Hey. Good to see you, Max.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.937
You too.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.408
And you must be Sophie.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.477
(Tess) Sophie helped us a lot.

01:18.546 --> 01:19.545
Even though she's a Saganash,

01:19.613 --> 01:22.147
she's a really good person.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.450
We don't care what your
last name is, Sophie.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.984

01:26.053 --> 01:27.486

01:39.700 --> 01:40.699

01:46.240 --> 01:48.774
This is hopeless. It won't budge!

01:48.843 --> 01:50.042
I once heard about this guy

01:50.111 --> 01:51.376
who dislocated both shoulders

01:51.445 --> 01:53.112
by trying to break down a door.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.013
Both of his arms just
dangled down his body,

01:55.082 --> 01:56.949
and he could never use 'em again.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.687
I don't know what to do.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.791
Well, there's nothing we <i> can</i> do.

02:05.860 --> 02:08.060
We just have to sit here and wait.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.164
It's gonna be okay.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.332
How do you know?

02:13.400 --> 02:15.968
What makes you so sure?

02:16.036 --> 02:19.271
I don't know. I just believe it.

02:19.340 --> 02:23.876
All we have to do is believe
and never give up, okay?

02:26.881 --> 02:29.948
Poor Daniel. Poor Nika.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.650
I don't think my father
would hurt them.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.820
He's obsessed, but he's not a criminal.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.891
Okay, well, he is a criminal,

02:38.959 --> 02:41.093
but he's not violent.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.394
He just wants the red diamond

02:42.463 --> 02:43.829
and the deed to this house.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.464
Oh, is that all?

02:45.533 --> 02:47.900
But we don't even know
where the deed is.

02:47.968 --> 02:51.203
No, but we have this.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.740
We just have to give it to
him, and hope it's enough

02:54.808 --> 02:56.642
for him to let Daniel and Anika go.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.544
No, it won't be enough.

02:58.612 --> 02:59.545
Okay, don't you get it?

02:59.613 --> 03:00.812
It's not about diamonds or deeds.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.948
He wants to destroy the Hunter family.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.617
You're right. It's just a rock.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.419
It may be worth millions,

03:07.488 --> 03:09.221
but it's nothing compared to you guys.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.524
I think I can find them.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.525
How?

03:13.594 --> 03:14.593
Anika and Daniel's phones

03:14.662 --> 03:15.861
are connected to Hunter Cloud.

03:15.930 --> 03:18.764
I think I can use it to
pinpoint their location.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.365
That's brilliant, Sal!

03:20.434 --> 03:21.800

03:32.813 --> 03:34.646
If you don't mind, would you stay here

11:19.646 --> 11:21.012
Erik thinks it was a trick to get them

11:21.081 --> 11:22.380
to leave us alone.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.882
He thinks your father is headed here.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.717
If he thinks he's getting the diamond,

11:25.786 --> 11:27.819
he'll have to go through
me, all right? Unh!

11:29.856 --> 11:31.022
Now, hey, calm down.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.290
Calm down! Let me just...

11:32.359 --> 11:34.225
You heard what Erik said.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.593
If giving Saganash the diamond

11:35.662 --> 11:36.761
gets Daniel and Nika back,

11:36.830 --> 11:37.929
then that's what we're gonna do.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.164
(Max) This is so frustrating.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.465
We're so close to getting the deed.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.566
I can feel it.

11:41.635 --> 11:42.701
What have you found so far?

11:42.769 --> 11:44.936
You see that painting of Kees Hunter?

11:45.005 --> 11:46.171
There's a slot in the frame

11:46.239 --> 11:48.139
where the red diamond fits perfectly.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.307
Whoa.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.912
It's exactly the same as
the walk-in painting.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.514
I've never noticed it before.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.217
Remember when Daniel was
in his alt-punk emo phase

11:59.286 --> 12:01.119
and he used to play music crazy loud?

12:01.188 --> 12:03.621
Do I ever. Being on the
same floor as him,

12:03.690 --> 12:05.724
I think it damaged my
hearing permanently.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.559
Right? (both imitating Daniel)

12:07.627 --> 12:08.660
All right, guys, guys, guys.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.761
Guys, what about it? What about it?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.563
Oh, yeah. (exhales sharply)

12:11.631 --> 12:14.499
Right. I used to hide in
here to do my homework.

12:16.603 --> 12:17.635
Ta-daa.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.108
(creaking)

12:27.114 --> 12:29.681
(Sal) Two paintings with
the exact same notch.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.316
I say that's extremely weird.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.617
Maybe if we put

12:32.686 --> 12:34.119
the blue diamond in this notch...

12:34.187 --> 12:36.321
It will lead us to the deed?

12:36.389 --> 12:38.156
It could be.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.325
Too bad we don't have the
blue diamond anymore.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.093
(Anika grunting)

12:42.162 --> 12:43.628
Too bad for you.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.633
(grunting) But good for me.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.568
(Sal) Saganash? Dad!

12:50.637 --> 12:52.170
Nika. Nika.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.139
Mm.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.140
Where's Daniel?

12:55.208 --> 12:56.341
He's in a safe place.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.243
Let's just say he's
my insurance policy.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.310
But, Dad, you can't...

12:59.379 --> 13:01.312
Quiet, Sophie!

13:01.381 --> 13:02.514
(Anika grunting)

13:03.784 --> 13:05.583
I really have to pee, I'm not kidding!

13:05.652 --> 13:06.651
Not another word!

13:09.956 --> 13:11.222
The red diamond.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.692
Now.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.996
Finally, Dad.

13:19.633 --> 13:23.234
What took you so long?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.369
I've been waiting

13:24.437 --> 13:27.672
for hours with these... Hunter jerks.

13:27.741 --> 13:30.208
Honestly, I wanted to throw myself

13:30.277 --> 13:32.377
out of a window.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.380
That is the last time I
apologize to anybody.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.714
We haven't got the deed yet,

13:36.783 --> 13:39.217
but we think we're close.

13:39.286 --> 13:42.020
It has something to do
with those two paintings.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.021
What's our next move?

13:43.089 --> 13:44.055
Well, I've got Daniel

13:44.124 --> 13:45.723
locked up in the car outside.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.325
You go keep an eye on him,

13:47.394 --> 13:48.393
and be on the lookout for their parents

13:48.461 --> 13:49.694
and that cop.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.396
It's almost over, Dad.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.198
And we're gonna win.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.167
Okay, now let Nika go.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.802
First, you tell me how

13:57.871 --> 13:59.804
those diamonds are gonna
lead me to the deed.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.339
We don't know.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.941
You're lying. Tell me.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.175
Please don't tell him.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.511
Tell me! Give me the blue diamond.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.080
I'll show you.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.256
And remember...

14:18.325 --> 14:20.658
I've got your sister. Ow! (whimpers)

14:38.778 --> 14:41.012
Are you playing games with me?

14:41.081 --> 14:42.313
Either you give me back
those two diamonds,

14:42.382 --> 14:43.314
or this little girl... (crying)

14:43.383 --> 14:44.582
Wait!

14:45.785 --> 14:48.286
It must be the other way around.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.921
Kees gave Josephine the blue one

14:49.990 --> 14:51.389
and Jan the red one.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.473
(rumbling)

15:24.224 --> 15:25.924
The deed.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.292
(Saganash) You, get me the deed.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.426
And don't do anything stupid.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.879
"Hereby, we do declare
that the ownership

15:47.948 --> 15:49.113

15:53.753 --> 15:55.219
There's places for two signatures.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.554
Hunter and Saganash.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.790
So, both families can sign it.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.224
(Sophie) I'll do it, Dad.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.593
I told you to watch the boy.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.529
Daniel can't go anywhere.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.965
And there's no sign of the parents.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.566
We're so close, Dad.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.575
Give me the deed. Sophie, get the deed!

Let Anika go or I will destroy it.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.448
I don't know what you're arguing about.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.918
The deed says that the estate
belongs to both families.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.420
You sentimental imbecile.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.555
