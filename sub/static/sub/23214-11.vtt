my friends felt at first, too.

19:01.380 --> 19:03.460
Miss Johnson, I...

19:03.460 --> 19:05.830
really appreciate
that you consider me a friend,

19:05.830 --> 19:10.330
but these spaces are
making everyone on
campus uncomfortable.

19:10.330 --> 19:12.830
Well, you know,
a wise person once told me

19:12.830 --> 19:15.460
that we have to get comfortable
with being uncomfortable.

19:15.460 --> 19:17.460
I mean, that's what college
is about.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.920
We should learn
from our discomfort.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.290
Okay, Miss Johnson,
let me be very clear.

19:23.290 --> 19:24.830
The reality
of this situation is

19:24.830 --> 19:28.210
these groups cannot find a way
to coexist peacefully.

19:28.210 --> 19:32.000
Well, if I prove to you that
they can, will you reconsider?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.290
I don't think
you're allowed back here.

19:33.290 --> 19:34.710
It's too late.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.040

Nothing.

20:18.790 --> 20:20.330
No, seriously.
What?

20:23.210 --> 20:26.460
It's just what you said, and,
uh, what you did for Hawkins.

20:26.460 --> 20:30.540
Not too bad for a shallow girl
from Sherman Oaks, huh?

20:30.540 --> 20:32.500
You're definitely
more than that.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.330
Thank you.

20:34.330 --> 20:37.000
And when Hawkins
is off probation,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.460
we'll throw a party
to celebrate, and you'll
be the first one invited.

20:39.460 --> 20:42.210
Oh, great. I'm so flattered.
Just no costumes.

20:42.210 --> 20:45.670
But th-- Costume parties
are a basic human right.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.960
Okay, I'm done
fighting with you.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.380
Thank you.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.250
-Doesn't mean you win.
-Yes.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.620
-Don't -- No, not the smile.
-Yes, it does.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.750
You have something on your face.
Can I please get it?
