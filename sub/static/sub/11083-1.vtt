10:00.601 --> 10:02.352
how did you show your tribe

10:02.352 --> 10:04.354
that you were ready,
that you're worthy now,

10:04.354 --> 10:06.773
that you're an adult,
and you're successful?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.859
Yes, Jackie?

10:08.859 --> 10:13.488
Didn't one tribe have you go out
and get an eagle feather?

10:13.488 --> 10:16.617
They did. So, what's
your eagle's feather today?

10:16.617 --> 10:19.453
How do you show your peers,
your homies, that you're making it?

10:19.453 --> 10:21.663
Huh? How do you get recognition?

10:21.663 --> 10:23.457
Yes, Paco?

10:23.457 --> 10:25.709
Having lots of money, like,
being a billionaire, ese.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.628
- [laughing]
- Being a billionaire. That'll do it.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.963
Being a sexy-chick movie star celebrity

10:29.963 --> 10:34.259
so you can be sexy enough
to drive folks crazy.

10:34.259 --> 10:38.055
Or you could have a big fly house
in a nice rich neighborhood like me.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.434
How about having a fly car,

10:42.434 --> 10:45.937
like a Bentley
with some bad-ass rims?

10:45.937 --> 10:49.858
- Being the hottest M.C.
- Or being famous, like the president.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.151
That'll also get you recognized.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.152
You on this president hitch, man.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.029
Owning Facebook.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.740
You know what else?
Being fitted with the right gear,

10:56.740 --> 10:58.408
having major swag.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.243
DR. SUTTON:
All right, okay. Check this out.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.536
So back in the days

11:01.536 --> 11:03.664
when people lived
in harmony with nature,

11:03.664 --> 11:07.668
the tribe elders made sure that whatever
you needed to be a success,

11:07.668 --> 11:11.171
to be recognized,
90% of the young people could do it.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.132
But today, most of you
will never be billionaires

11:14.132 --> 11:16.551
or drive a Bentley
or be a big, sexy movie star

11:16.551 --> 11:17.636
or be president.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.346
Now, some of you will,
and more power to you.

11:19.346 --> 11:23.684
But the majority of you will never,
ever feel recognized by your tribe.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.769
You'll never get your eagle's feather.

11:25.769 --> 11:26.978
That's messed up, man.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.271
Yeah, well, check this out:

11:28.271 --> 11:30.273
It is also a big part of what?

11:30.273 --> 11:32.109
Can anyone guess?

11:33.068 --> 11:34.986
The economy.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.488
Why?

11:36.488 --> 11:39.825
If 90% of you feel
insecure and inadequate,

11:39.825 --> 11:42.202
you're going to buy our products.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.330
We make you feel
that you'll be recognized more

11:45.330 --> 11:47.290
if you buy this big fly house
in Beverly Hills,

11:47.290 --> 11:49.459
or Baldwin Hills or View Park.

11:49.459 --> 11:52.379
If that doesn't work, I'll sell you a car
you can't really afford,

11:52.379 --> 11:54.548
a nice one with beautiful rims.

11:54.548 --> 11:58.135
But will that new fly car really,
really really satisfy you?

11:58.844 --> 12:00.554
- Yep.
- Yeah?

12:00.554 --> 12:01.930
For how long?

12:01.930 --> 12:03.598
Five years? Ten years?

12:03.598 --> 12:04.766
'Cause then I'll flip it up a little bit.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.435
You know what I'll do?
I'll change the style,

12:06.435 --> 12:08.311
or put some new rims on it,

12:08.311 --> 12:10.188
and before you know it,
in 10 years you car looks old.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.274
And then you've got to come back to me
for some new swag.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.402
You're hooked,
because I supply your status.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.903
Because you know what we did?

12:16.903 --> 12:20.657
We elders put the emphasis
not on who you are

12:20.657 --> 12:23.034
but on what you drive.

12:23.034 --> 12:27.581
In fact, I'll have you young people
singing my ads for my products

12:27.581 --> 12:28.999
- for free.
- What?

12:28.999 --> 12:30.792
Singing your ads for free how?

12:30.792 --> 12:34.087
Easy. You turn on the radio.
You all do it all the time.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.131
Gucci man,
Beemer, Benz and Bentley.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.426
Got my Vans on.
Look at all the gold I got.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.762
Insecure people buy a lot of stuff
they don't need

12:41.762 --> 12:43.054
'cause we want
to impress our friends.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.265
So what about secure people?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.851
Could you get someone like
Mahatma Gandhi

12:47.851 --> 12:48.852
to buy a new Cadillac?

12:48.852 --> 12:50.395
CLASS: No.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.105
- Why not?
- Because he wouldn't want it.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.356
He wouldn't want it.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.441
But we still respected him.
Why?

12:55.275 --> 12:56.359
Yes, Michelle.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.153
Because he freed India
from British colonialism.

12:58.153 --> 13:01.782
Correct. Could you have gotten Mother Teresa
to buy some breast implants?

13:01.782 --> 13:03.492
CLASS: No.

13:03.492 --> 13:07.788
We liked her,
because she helped people and whatnot.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.248
That's why we liked her, because
she helped people and whatnot.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.833
Not because she looked sexy.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.127
What about Dr. King or Brother Malcolm?

13:14.127 --> 13:16.588
Did they have lots of money
and run up credit card debt?

13:16.588 --> 13:17.631
CLASS: No.

13:17.631 --> 13:18.715
Okay, let's take it to the top.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.801
Let's go to Jesus Christ.

13:20.801 --> 13:24.221
Would Jesus Christ
buy a pair of Gucci shoes?

13:24.221 --> 13:25.305
CLASS: No!

13:25.305 --> 13:27.182
- I can't hear you. Would he?
- No!

13:27.182 --> 13:29.309
So, real secure people,
they don't need all that.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.393
What am I saying?
You're nodding your head.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.478
What am I saying?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.814
You're saying that true success
isn't about what you buy or drive

13:33.814 --> 13:35.398
or what your body looks like.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.317
DR. SUTTON:
Right. What I'm saying is

13:37.317 --> 13:41.029
if you want to go out in the world
and do something big--

13:41.029 --> 13:43.990
teach a child to read,

13:43.990 --> 13:46.117
invent a clean energy source,

13:46.117 --> 13:47.577
sacrifice for others.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.412
You might not be able
to buy your success,

13:49.412 --> 13:51.289
or your recognition, or drive it.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.291
You might have to do something,
you understand?

13:53.291 --> 13:56.920
How about getting all of us elders
to stop killing each other

13:56.920 --> 13:58.839
and destroying the planet
that you're going to inherit?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.423
QUE: Go ahead and preach it,
Dr. Sutton.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.967
I'm preaching away.
Okay, you're right. you're right.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.302
Okay, end of the year.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.763
That means, seniors,
you'll have your senior project.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.349
The juniors can assist you
but they can only act

14:09.349 --> 14:10.851
in a support capacity.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.311
Eduardo,
you're doing the tech board?

14:13.311 --> 14:16.064
Okay, and Calvin, you're doing
movement choreography?

14:16.064 --> 14:17.607
Yes, sir.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.609
And Cheyenne, you are doing
visual thematics?

14:19.609 --> 14:21.444
- Yeah.
- Have you thought of a theme yet?

14:21.444 --> 14:23.864
Yes, I thought we would do
successes and failures.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.949
We would interview people
and see if they felt

14:25.949 --> 14:28.285
like they had done what they
wanted with their lives.

14:28.285 --> 14:29.369
Tell you what,
if you're gonna do that,

14:29.369 --> 14:30.453
go outside your comfort zone.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.164
Don't just talk to your mom and Michelle
and a couple of your friends.

14:33.164 --> 14:36.626
I want you to talk to rich folks,
folks that live in cardboard condos,

14:36.626 --> 14:38.920
Republicans, Democrats. All of us.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.505
That's kind of a big list.

14:40.505 --> 14:41.631
It's a big subject.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.800
All right, get cracking.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.220
You're directing and shooting,
so who's doing your interviews?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.221
Reggie Otum will.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.223
Good luck.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.892
Thank you, class.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.104
Your pops is heavy, dude.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.856
Hold on, teenage people.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.357
Your class president has a word for you.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.944
The grades will be posted
on the boards today.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.655
All seniors with a 3.5 GPA or higher

15:05.655 --> 15:08.909
can tutor lowerclassmen on the mandatory
tutoring extra credit list.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.744

15:10.744 --> 15:13.747
Secondly, if you haven't bought
your tickets for prom yet,

15:13.747 --> 15:15.540
please hurry up.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.459
Calvin.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.669
This year's prom theme
is Green Glamour.

15:19.669 --> 15:22.380
And as you know,
green is all about recycling

15:22.380 --> 15:23.590
and re-fabulating.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.216
So I want you to be creative,

15:25.216 --> 15:29.554
and get some of your parents'
old fantabulous, old-school glamour

15:29.554 --> 15:31.014
- and rework it.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.975
And if you don't buy a ticket for prom,
you can't vote for prom queen.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.644
We all know
who that should be.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.729
Dude, she's like the black
Sarah Palin, you know?

- Ooh!

15:52.369 --> 15:54.746
- Thought he was slick.
- Go hang out with Pops.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.958
- Sorry, man.
- Need you to stay after class, remember?

15:57.958 --> 16:00.543
Yeah, um, there's only 10 minutes
till the next class,

16:00.543 --> 16:02.128

16:02.128 --> 16:03.463
And I need to use the restroom.

That's nice.
That's real nice.

I just almost got killed.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.639
- No, dude.
- Please.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.266
- No, dude. You got to do it.
- You know Reggie won't let me near Michelle.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.143
You know what?
Mopey, it's your turn to go.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.936
I'm not in this at all.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.896
Oh, my gosh. You're scared,

19:06.896 --> 19:08.898
Mini-Me ain't doing shit,
and you're heartbroken.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.484
You know, give me that shoe.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.527
I'm gonna film this kitty
like the goddamn Discovery Channel.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.904
Go for it. [scatting]

19:14.904 --> 19:16.447
[ululating]

19:16.447 --> 19:20.618
Hey, Paco, you know they can deport you
if you don't maintain that B average, <i>ese.</i>

[Speaking Spanish]

19:22.328 --> 19:24.622
[overlapping dialogue]

19:28.751 --> 19:30.962
QUE: Dude, holy shit.

19:30.962 --> 19:33.131
OBAMA: What girl wears
leopard print panties

19:33.131 --> 19:34.591
with pink lace trim on the side

19:34.591 --> 19:36.551
if she does not want anyone
to admire them?

19:36.551 --> 19:38.344
QUICKTIME:
Guys know what a leopard is?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.971
- What?
- It's a 200-pound pussy

19:39.971 --> 19:41.973
that'll eat a man up.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.266
[laughing]

19:43.266 --> 19:46.978
Dumbshit #10, our very own...

19:46.978 --> 19:49.856
Hendrix Sutton.
Get your ass down here, boy.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.067
Go.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.652
REGGIE:
Hey, man, shut up, boy.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.696
[chattering]

19:56.696 --> 20:00.241
["Bomb dropping"]

20:03.828 --> 20:05.788
Looks like Papa Bear's
failing Baby Bear

20:05.788 --> 20:06.789
and killing his GPA.

20:06.789 --> 20:08.458
Reggie, stop.

20:12.587 --> 20:16.174
- Aw.
- Hey, don't cry, please.

20:16.424 --> 20:19.761
They say the eyes
are the windows to the soul.

20:20.595 --> 20:23.681
Now, you can't look people in the eyes,
they ain't gonna trust you.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.851
And they sure as hell
won't hire you.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.023
Are you afraid to look me
in the eyes, C.C.?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.322
You okay?

20:41.407 --> 20:43.201
Yeah.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.371
My big bro in town,

20:46.371 --> 20:48.539
so could I go now?

20:53.127 --> 20:54.629
Go ahead.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.772
I can't believe you put me
on the retard list.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.525
The tutoring list is
voluntary and mandatory.

21:16.651 --> 21:17.819
I volunteered you.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.487
Nobody volunteers to be on that list.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.905
Do you even know
how you made me look?

21:20.905 --> 21:22.699
Yeah, like a kid who
wants to get his grades up.

21:22.699 --> 21:25.201
I tried to tell you earlier,
but you was in too much of a rush.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.412
In all my other classes,
I have at least a

21:27.412 --> 21:28.871
And you settle for a

21:28.871 --> 21:30.331
When Mom told me
you were going to work here,

21:30.331 --> 21:32.000
she said I didn't even need
to take your class.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.835
I took it out of respect for you,

21:33.835 --> 21:35.295
because it would make you happy.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.338
And it does, son.
Now, make me happy,

21:37.338 --> 21:39.424
and get an
Okay, you can do it.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.092
It's time to tutor.
Finals are coming--

21:41.092 --> 21:42.593
I don't have time to tutor, Dad.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.595
I need to get enough money
to pay for a car and pay--

21:44.595 --> 21:45.680
Don't interrupt me.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.140
Now, let me clarify something for you.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.059
You don't get your grades up,
there's no more party business.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.520
There's no going out,
and there's no car.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.898
- What if I move back in with Mom?
- No.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.567
No more ping-ponging
back and forth

21:57.567 --> 21:59.861
between me and Mom to see
who you get a better deal from.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.405
You're with me until you graduate.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.533
- Anything else?
- No.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.243
You still need me to get your D.J. equipment
over to Chowder's?

22:07.243 --> 22:08.286
No.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.789
All right, I'll see you after the party.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.335
[door slams]

22:16.336 --> 22:19.005
[drums play]

22:19.005 --> 22:22.300
CALVIN: Boom, boom, boom.
Bring that energy. Bring that energy.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.302
Yes, yes.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.054
That's right, girls. Hit it.

22:28.473 --> 22:30.183
Huh.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.934
[chuckles]

22:31.934 --> 22:33.853
Looks like your senior class project's
gonna be the bomb.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.355
I hope so.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.065
Point those toes, girls.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.983
DR. SUTTON:
Hey, Megan, I like that little extra

22:38.983 --> 22:41.361
"I got it going on" attitude
you're doing, girl.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.612
Thanks, Dr. Sutton.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.197
CALVIN:
Keep that energy up.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.573
Let's take a walk.

22:47.617 --> 22:50.244
Five, six, seven, eight.

22:51.788 --> 22:54.874
If they ain't offering no full scholarship,
I'm not interested.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.628
Okay, all right.
All right, bye.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.296
- Hey.
- What up?

23:00.296 --> 23:01.798
It's the list of locations for the shoot.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.508
Read it to me.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.844
Sunday morning, 9 A.M.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.721
At the 14th Street Mission
near the Bowery.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.473
Skid Row?

23:10.473 --> 23:11.724
What, I'm interviewing bums?

23:12.016 --> 23:14.102
Homeless people.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.188
Sponsors ain't gonna want their new star
interviewing no homeless people.

23:17.188 --> 23:18.689
BOY: You ain't got no sponsors, dawg.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.358
Okay, but I will. Watch.

23:20.358 --> 23:21.484
- Reggie...
- What?

23:21.484 --> 23:22.568
- Please.
- BOY: Yo, Reggie,

23:22.568 --> 23:26.823
I'll trade you this PB&J and these chips
for one of your healthy-ass sandwiches.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.533
Hey, why you trying to play me?

23:28.533 --> 23:29.909
You know I'm allergic to that nasty shit.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.369
You can't cancel on me now.

23:31.994 --> 23:36.624
Okay, look, if I'm going to be on TV,
and interviewing people,

23:36.624 --> 23:38.459
I gotta be like them cats on ESPN.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.294
I know you seen it.
They got the nice suit.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.256
The A.C. studio,
our own little coffee mug.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.924
That's top notch. I want that.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.927
And plus, I got practice on Sunday,
so I'm sorry.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.515
So am I.

23:54.559 --> 23:57.437
Hey. You know we ain't
got no practice, right?

23:57.437 --> 23:59.355
Dawg, I know that,
but you like her,

23:59.355 --> 24:02.316
so I was trying to stay cool with her
till I drop Michelle, all right?

24:02.316 --> 24:03.651
Dr. Sutton?

24:05.403 --> 24:07.071
[sniffles]

24:07.822 --> 24:11.159
Oh. I thought you were your dad.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.080
That's kinda scary.

24:16.080 --> 24:21.711
Um, I think he said he'll be back soon.
Just give him a couple minutes more.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.172
[Sighs]

24:24.172 --> 24:26.048
You can wait here.
It's cool with me.

24:29.469 --> 24:32.180
[Cheyenne sniffs, sighs]

24:36.142 --> 24:38.478
REGGIE: Hendrix Sutton,
get your ass down here, boy.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.690
- Shut up, Reggie.
- Oh, shit.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.233
Oh, my God.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.911
[romantic music]

25:11.969 --> 25:13.679
CHEYENNE: Hard, huh?

25:13.679 --> 25:15.306
[record scratch]

25:17.016 --> 25:19.352
Your day was kind of hard?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.189
Are you okay?

25:23.189 --> 25:25.441
Yeah.

25:28.486 --> 25:30.321
No, I'm not.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.532
Reggie's such an asshole.

25:32.532 --> 25:36.702
He bailed on me. This is the one class
that could ruin my GPA,

25:36.702 --> 25:39.830
and if your dad doesn't
give me a break, I'm screwed.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.415
[crying]

25:41.415 --> 25:44.835
[cellphone rings]

25:44.835 --> 25:46.003
Hi, Daddy.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.004
<i>DAD: You home?</i>

25:47.004 --> 25:48.923
No, I'll be there soon.

25:48.923 --> 25:49.924
<i>You Okay?</i>

25:49.924 --> 25:51.676
Yeah, everything's fine.

25:51.676 --> 25:53.177
<i>Michelle's still going
to walk you, right?</i>

25:53.177 --> 25:56.556
Yeah, she is.
Okay, bye.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.727
- Michelle, where are you?
- At the <i>mall.</i>

26:01.727 --> 26:03.062
With Reggie?
Did he tell you?

26:03.062 --> 26:05.898
<i>What? Oh, my God.
I totally forgot.</i>

26:05.898 --> 26:07.525
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

26:07.525 --> 26:08.985
But my dad is expecting us
to walk home together.

26:08.985 --> 26:10.403
You know how he is.

26:10.403 --> 26:12.154
<i>REGGIE: Cheyenne,
she'll have to call you back.</i>

26:12.154 --> 26:14.448
<i>- Michelle?
- REGGIE: Bye.</i>

26:16.534 --> 26:19.745
Oh, sorry for the drama.
I gotta go.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.747
<i>HENDRIX, voiceover: No!</i>

26:21.747 --> 26:22.957
No.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.127
No?

26:26.127 --> 26:27.712
You shouldn't walk home alone.

26:27.712 --> 26:29.589
Um, I should walk you.

26:30.172 --> 26:31.799
It's okay. You're waiting for your dad.

26:31.799 --> 26:35.052
Um, he's being a jerk.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.722
I mean, he's being a jerk
to you and to me.

26:38.723 --> 26:40.349
I'll see him later.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.893
Come on, can we go before
he drops my grade lower?

26:42.893 --> 26:45.605
Like a "D" or something?
Come on, please?

26:46.606 --> 26:47.940
WOMAN: Manny, A.J., please.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.859
[Speaking Spanish]

26:49.859 --> 26:51.902
My grandsons. They're only going
to be here for a couple hours.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.279
It's okay.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.697
What's up, D?

26:57.199 --> 26:58.367
What's all this?

26:58.367 --> 27:01.162
Oh, recycled art for the prom.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.163
[knocking]

27:04.457 --> 27:06.042
I need to make the deposit.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.335
Oh, sorry.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.920
The bank closes soon.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.422
Here you go, hon.

27:11.422 --> 27:19.597
Okay, $942,
prom ticket sales.

27:19.597 --> 27:21.599
- Okay.
- I'll see you in the morning.

27:21.599 --> 27:22.683
All right, thank you.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.268
[clattering, children shouting]

27:24.268 --> 27:26.479
Don't let them drive you crazy.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.980
[chuckling]

27:30.858 --> 27:32.568
Now, what's going on?

27:33.736 --> 27:36.322
I think that you are being
too hard on our son.

27:36.947 --> 27:39.158
Is this about the tutoring list?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.993
He's never been good at testing.

27:40.993 --> 27:45.039
You refuse to acknowledge
that he was diagnosed as ADD.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.457
I refuse to use it as a crutch.

27:46.457 --> 27:47.833
Your ego is clouding your judgment.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.419
He tells me things
that he won't tell you.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.380
Well, of course he does.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.464
When kids are lucky enough

27:53.464 --> 27:55.508
to have both their parents in their lives,
that's what they do.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.968
They try to get their bread
buttered on both sides.

27:57.968 --> 28:00.346
Remember when stuff used
to disappear from your purse?

28:00.346 --> 28:02.890
Nah, come on.
Remember when he was stealing shit

28:02.890 --> 28:05.059
until you started paying him not to?

28:05.059 --> 28:06.477
Because you wouldn't
give him an allowance.

28:06.477 --> 28:07.520
He was 11 years old.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.771
Of course I wanted to
give him an allowance.

28:08.771 --> 28:10.147
I wanted him to work for it.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.691
I want him to have a sense
of work ethic.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.651
My point is,
we got through it, didn't we?

28:13.651 --> 28:14.777
Yes, by beating him.

28:14.777 --> 28:16.404
I love our sons.

28:16.404 --> 28:19.365
I would never spank him
unless I had an open hand.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.991
And only as a last resort.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.451
And Hendrix would get the worst of it.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.994
He's a hard-headed kid.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.539
That's the boy we got.
We got us a two-slap son.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.419
Your tough love experiment

28:31.419 --> 28:34.505
is going to ruin his ability
to get into a good college

28:34.797 --> 28:37.800
and erode his self-confidence.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.430
He is not you.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.440
HENDRIX:
So, you going to prom?

28:52.440 --> 28:54.275
CHEYENNE:
I don't know.

28:54.275 --> 28:57.653
What do you mean?
Didn't Stunner ask you?

28:57.653 --> 28:58.904
[chuckles]

28:58.904 --> 29:00.740
I didn't answer him yet.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.868
Okay, well, am I being too nosy
or something?

29:03.868 --> 29:05.578
Yeah, you're being nosy.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.706
Even if I wanted to go
to the prom with Stunner,

29:08.706 --> 29:11.167
I don't think my dad
would approve.

29:11.167 --> 29:12.918
Hm.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.754
And you always do
what your dad says?

29:14.754 --> 29:16.380
Pretty much.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.007
Until I escape to college.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.884
If I escape.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.680
My academic scholarship
is based on a high GPA.

29:25.389 --> 29:28.434
Oh, so if you get,
like, a low grade...

29:28.434 --> 29:30.144

maybe one day I can own
the label I sing on.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.340

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:19.187
- Ha ha.
- Watch your step, brother.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.773
What are you doing?

01:13:21.773 --> 01:13:23.149
You're looking for me, huh?

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:26.194
- Yeah, I got you.
- Obama. Obama.

01:13:26.194 --> 01:13:27.737
Yo, your master's calling you.

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:30.240
- Yo, bitch boy.
- Walk away. Get out of here.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.950
Yo, man, the principal
wants to see you.

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:33.451
- What's going on?
- I don't know, man.

01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:35.161
But whatever it is,
it's some heavy shit.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.329
The cops were here earlier.

01:13:38.623 --> 01:13:41.459
So the day before yesterday was supposed
to be our last day in this class.

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:45.088
But unfortunately I've got
to drag everybody back here

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:46.756
for something pretty disturbing.

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:48.842
Now, the other day when
Miss Chavez stopped by,

01:13:48.842 --> 01:13:50.385
she put her purse over there.

01:13:50.385 --> 01:13:55.849
I think I put it in--
on one of these tables.

01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:57.517
Oh, right here.

01:13:58.852 --> 01:14:00.145
Eduardo, were you there at the time?

01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:01.396
I was in the restroom.

01:14:01.396 --> 01:14:04.357
Okay, go stand in the back.

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:07.694
Now, inside the bag was cash
from the prom ticket sales.

01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:09.779
When she went to make
the deposit at the bank,

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:12.907
she realized that it was missing.

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:14.951
MICHELLE: So I'm here
because I'm, like, a suspect?

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:17.579
Why would I need to steal the money?
That's ridiculous.

01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:19.873
Yeah, obviously it was someone
who needs the money.

01:14:19.873 --> 01:14:22.083
Rich people steal more money
than anyone.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.209
Half the time,
that's how they get rich.

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:24.836
Yeah, that's right. Tell him.

01:14:24.836 --> 01:14:27.338
DR. SUTTON: Hey, look.
Anyone could have taken the money.

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:29.257
Well, how much money
was in there?

01:14:29.257 --> 01:14:31.426
$1,211.

01:14:31.426 --> 01:14:34.721
Now, right now the school is not
looking to press charges.

01:14:34.721 --> 01:14:37.390
We would just
like the money returned.

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.225
What if no one admits to it?

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:41.478
Well, then we'd have to refund
the remaining money

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:44.022
and we'd probably have
to cancel the prom.

01:14:44.022 --> 01:14:45.482
What?

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:48.735
Yep. This class will
become a crime scene,

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.404
police will get involved,

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:53.615
and whoever did it

01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:56.409
will have to face the consequences.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:57.827
One klepto jerk steals the money

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.370
and now we're going to cancel prom?

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.164
Uh-oh, prom queen's
gonna miss a photo op.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:03.708
Shut up, Taco, Paco,
whatever your name is.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:04.709
Some of us actually care.

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:06.711
Hey, stay civil.

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:09.547
All right, we've got three minutes
until recess is over.

01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:10.882
Then the bell's going to ring,

01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:12.884
police are going to come in
and take statements.

01:15:12.884 --> 01:15:15.386
DR. SUTTON:
We all make mistakes.

01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:19.682
But rarely do you get a chance
to do damage control.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:22.143
But what if they already
spent part of the money?

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:23.311
Why you keep looking at me?

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:26.356
[Speaking Spanish]

01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:28.691
Hey, hey, language! Sit down.

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:31.861
MS. REYNOLDS: Look, a lot of you have worked
very hard on the prom fundraiser,

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:35.907
so whoever it is,
don't ruin it for everyone else.

01:15:35.907 --> 01:15:38.159
Regardless if you spent some of it,

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:41.913
or not, say so now. Please.

01:15:41.913 --> 01:15:45.166
Let's not end a good year
on a bad note.

01:15:51.923 --> 01:15:53.341
17 seconds.

01:15:56.970 --> 01:16:00.181
Come on. 12 seconds.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.875
[bell rings]

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:30.587
All right. Nope, no, no.
Stay in your seats.

01:16:30.587 --> 01:16:32.171
Stay in your seats.
Sit back down.

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:34.382
Police officers are going to come in,

01:16:34.382 --> 01:16:36.342
and they're going to have
to take some statements.

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:40.513
- I took it.
- What?

01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:48.229
Why?

01:16:49.314 --> 01:16:50.398
You know why.

01:16:51.858 --> 01:16:53.318
For a car?

01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:55.028
Where's the money?

01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:56.529
What an asshole.

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:59.616
Hey! Where is the money?

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:02.702
It's in my box. At home.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:06.122
Well, go get it.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:08.625
Go!

01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:20.136
How we doing here?

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:28.144
Not too good.
But I think we got it under control.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:30.688
Oh, do you, now?

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:32.482
Yes, I do.

01:17:32.482 --> 01:17:34.567
Thank you for your time, officers.

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:36.152
MS. REYNOLDS: Class dismissed.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:38.279
Come on, get to your next class.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.157
Come on, let's go.

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:46.412
You know, I bought a speed boat
with the money I made in overtime

01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:48.206
chasing little black boys like this.

01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:52.710
Little punks who think
they've got everybody fooled.

01:17:55.505 --> 01:17:57.340
Sad but true.

01:17:59.217 --> 01:18:01.344
I'll see you when you're 18.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:02.470
Not if I can help it.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.349
Well, apparently, you can't.

01:18:13.898 --> 01:18:16.651
She would, like,
top me off, top me off.

01:18:16.651 --> 01:18:18.945
- Man, she topped me off, too.
- She topped me off first.

01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:23.991
Hey, good job hosting that show.

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:25.910
Really stole it.

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.912
- Hey, man, crime don't pay.
- Crime don't pay, man.

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:31.165
Anyway, we gotta go practice.

01:18:31.165 --> 01:18:33.292
Y'all let me play,
I can be at practice too, man.

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:35.586
- Shut up.
- All right.

01:18:37.922 --> 01:18:40.508
[laughing]

01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:24.635
Hey, bro.

01:19:26.596 --> 01:19:29.932
If you need to talk, I'm here.

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:33.686
Stupid motherfucker!

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:36.230
You crazy?

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.316
You have two strikes already!
You have a son!

01:19:38.316 --> 01:19:40.276
- What you talking about?
- You're 20 years old!

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:42.153
They'll try you as an adult!

01:19:42.153 --> 01:19:44.447
Over $1,200, you want to
end up like your brother?

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:46.783
Why the fuck you hit me,
you little bitch-ass nigga?

01:19:46.783 --> 01:19:47.867
- I was trying to help!
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:51.287
[phone rings]

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:54.457
Look, Hendrix is going crazy.
We got to stop him.

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:56.751
OFFICER: Walker, head east on campus.
Something's going down.

01:19:56.751 --> 01:19:58.252
You want to end up
like your brother?

01:19:58.252 --> 01:20:00.379
Fuck my brother.

01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:02.673
Look at my name, Conscious Criminal,
I don't give a motherfuck.

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:04.967
Boys' locker room,
boys' locker room!

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:10.932
[shouting]

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:14.769
- You want to end up like your brother?
- Fuck my brother.

01:20:14.769 --> 01:20:16.020
- Que, do your mama jokes, man.
- What?

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.563
Que, do your mama jokes, dude.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.816
Your mama so fat,
bitch got her own zip code.

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:21.818
- [forced laughter]
- Laugh.

01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:23.277
You want to get expelled?
Help me make them laugh.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:26.280
Laugh, laugh, laugh.
Ha, ha, ha.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.699
Laugh, motherfuckers.

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:30.451
[laughing]

01:20:33.079 --> 01:20:35.498
Dr. Sutton!

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:38.835
I'm sorry.
They get into everything.

01:20:38.835 --> 01:20:40.211
It was him. It's his fault.

01:20:40.211 --> 01:20:42.797
No, it was you. It was you.

01:20:42.797 --> 01:20:44.757
- It was your fault.
- No, it was you.

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:46.133
Your mama's so damn ugly,

01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:48.344
she looked out the window,
and got arrested for mooning.

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:49.887
Oh yeah? Uh...

01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:51.264
What the hell's going on?

01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:53.516
Uh, just telling jokes.

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:56.686
Yeah.

01:20:56.686 --> 01:20:58.062
So did you actually
see them fighting?

01:20:58.062 --> 01:21:00.648
No. When we got there,
these two were laughing,

01:21:00.648 --> 01:21:02.483
and that one was cracking jokes.

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:05.695
Excuse me, Principal Reynolds,
this was after the bell started ringing,

01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:07.905
so technically,
we were not cutting class.

01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:09.657
I'm aware of the rules.

01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:13.661
What happened to your face?

01:21:13.661 --> 01:21:16.455
I slipped and hit the sink.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:20.042
And you?

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:24.297
When he fell, I caught an elbow,

01:21:24.297 --> 01:21:25.923
and it tore my shirt.

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:29.010
I will deal with you later.

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:32.471
Do you remember
what I told you would happen

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:34.015
if you came to my office again?

01:21:36.309 --> 01:21:37.560
Yeah.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.061
DR. SUTTON: Excuse me.

01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:42.773
We, uh...
We have a situation.

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:44.483
Miss Chavez.

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:45.902
[Speaking Spanish]

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:56.245
While my daughter is away,
I watch my grandsons.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:58.789
They get into everything.

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:08.090
I found the money under the bed.

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:13.179
I'm so sorry.

01:22:13.179 --> 01:22:16.849
Please, forgive me.

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:23.522
I hope that one day,
when my grandson grows up,

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:27.944
he will be as brave as your boy.

01:22:36.077 --> 01:22:37.411
What's this?

01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:43.292
Did you give us your car money?

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.839
DR. SUTTON: You people mind
excusing us for a minute?

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:05.439
Honey, why did you say you took it?

01:23:08.693 --> 01:23:11.696
I'm 16, and C.C.'s 20.

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:16.534
This would have been
his third strike.

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:20.204
He could have lost his son
to foster care.

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:27.545
C.C. didn't grow up with what I have.

01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:35.636
Can I go?

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.638
Yeah, go ahead.

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.560
[Sighs]

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:12.965
Hey, bro, you got a minute?

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:29.106
I thought you did it, man.
I was trippin'.

01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:35.863
Man, people been thinking that
about me my whole life.

01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:39.825
Sometimes, they was right.

01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:45.998
But, like, ain't nobody
ever did what you did.

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:51.629
You thought I was doin' dirt,
but you still tried to save me.

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:53.923
My own brother...

01:24:57.218 --> 01:25:01.097
My own brother let me go down
for some bullshit he did.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:10.231
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be graduating,

01:25:10.231 --> 01:25:13.692
I would have got expelled.

01:25:14.985 --> 01:25:17.029
So what's the next move, man?

01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:21.700
You know, Conscious Criminal ain't ready
to give up on the rap game yet.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:25.579
I got to stay conscious.
Ain't no selling out.

01:25:29.333 --> 01:25:31.127
One more thing.

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:34.797
Don't ever throw that jab my way again.

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:41.428
All right.

01:25:42.555 --> 01:25:44.014
REGGIE: Hey, Obama.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:46.809
Boy, Hendrix, dumber than you, dawg.

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:49.436
Why would anyone sacrifice $1,200

01:25:49.436 --> 01:25:51.772
for another drive-by
