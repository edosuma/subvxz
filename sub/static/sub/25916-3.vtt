[theme music playing]

00:22.230 --> 00:24.232
[dog howling]

00:24.315 --> 00:26.776
[herald] Four o'clock and all is well!

00:27.360 --> 00:30.405
Actually, "well" is a bit
of an overstatement.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.365
"Acceptable" is more like it,

00:32.449 --> 00:37.120
if you consider death, disease
and rampant poverty acceptable.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.873
Shut up! Do you know what time it is?

00:39.956 --> 00:43.126
4:01 and all is well!

00:43.209 --> 00:45.045
Actually, "well" is an overstatement.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.421
[woman] Shut up!

00:47.047 --> 00:49.049
[jaunty tavern music plays]

00:51.259 --> 00:54.345
-[all laughing]
-Ah, wow.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.973
What a naughty night we had.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.852
I drank so much, I can't even remember
if I drank anything.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.020
I might not have.

01:02.103 --> 01:05.106
You know it's a great night when
we're still up to see the plague patrol.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.233
Mornin', Princess.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.153
I just got winked at by a corpse shoveler.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.822
I don't want this night to ever end.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.408
Well, then, madame, I have just the thing.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.453
-[horse snorts]
-May I interest you in a joyride?

01:18.536 --> 01:19.746
Joyride?

01:19.829 --> 01:24.334
Is that like a jolly trolley
or a fun run or a tingle mingle?

01:24.417 --> 01:27.587
Oh, he means that we steal it
and that it's a bad idea.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.964
If my dad found out, he'd kill me.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.800
Ooh, boo-hoo.

01:31.883 --> 01:34.677
Baby doesn't wanna get killed
by her daddy.

01:34.761 --> 01:35.970
I'm a chicken.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.972
[imitates chicken clucking]

01:38.056 --> 01:41.267
Hop on, boys. Unless you're chickens.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.268
[demon] Ha!

01:43.019 --> 01:44.687
[demon vocalizes and grunts]

01:46.898 --> 01:51.027
Hey, that's Lady Lingonberry's carriage!
I was stealing it!

01:53.196 --> 01:55.365
Not on my watch.

02:03.081 --> 02:06.835
I'm actually a more way careful driver
when I'm drunk.

02:06.918 --> 02:11.673
I assume that, just 'cause I've never...
I've never driven before.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.592
[chuckles] I'm having
so much joy right now.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.553
Get ready.
Next week, we're gonna try arson.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.935
[mimics radio static]
We got a 619 in progress.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.312
Suspects headed west on the royal highway.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.939
Requesting backup. [mimics radio static]

02:28.022 --> 02:31.484
[mimics radio static]
Roger that. Git. Go on.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.736
[donkeys braying]

02:40.702 --> 02:43.454
Oh, foo. We're gonna to get arrested.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.373
You know they prey on the weak in prison?

02:45.456 --> 02:47.417
-At least, I intend to.
-[woman gasps]

02:50.170 --> 02:51.004
[woman] Whoo!

02:52.463 --> 02:54.132
Ahh!

02:58.219 --> 03:00.388
Please do not feed my vehicle.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.140
[horse neighs]

03:04.225 --> 03:05.643
[donkeys braying]

03:07.312 --> 03:09.856
Hang on. I've got a bad idea.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.609
[elf] What's bad about it?
Oh, never mind, I see.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.535
[all grunt]

03:25.038 --> 03:28.541
-[grunts] I just love driving.
-[all cheer]

03:30.293 --> 03:32.003
I'm drowning!

03:32.086 --> 03:33.254
I'm Elfo!

03:43.181 --> 03:47.060
[woman] If anyone asks, just be honest
and say she was alive when we ran away.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.562
Some might say her cries for help
were a cry for help,

03:49.646 --> 03:51.773
but I think she was
just being an attention hog.

03:51.856 --> 03:54.150
Oh, no. We're locked out.

03:57.570 --> 04:02.116
Okay, the trick to not getting swept
over the waterfall is swimming upstream.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.244
Got it. Now, what's "swimming"?

04:11.125 --> 04:15.505
Okay, Elfo. You can do anything
if you believe in yourself.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.340
[screaming]

04:19.384 --> 04:20.551
[splash]

04:21.427 --> 04:25.515
It was so nice of that swarm of crabs
to drag me ashore.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.937
Anyone want this meat?
I only eat it for the shells.

04:31.020 --> 04:34.274
The perfect end to a night
of grand theft carriage.

04:34.983 --> 04:39.028
Whoa. That looks damn delicious.
What the hell is it?

04:39.112 --> 04:42.991
It's a super-rare fruit the knights
brought back from their crusades.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.118
A lot of people died for it.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.078
It's like my dad's prized possession.

04:47.161 --> 04:51.165
Sometimes he just stares at it longingly
while he drinks vodka sodas.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.668
-[slurps]
-It's a lemon, guys.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.420
It's what we feed children in Hell.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.963
Come on, I dare you to try it.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.677
Have they no respect
for the Lemon Crusades?

05:02.760 --> 05:07.473
Civilizations were decimated.
History rewritten. Maps redrawn.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.518
To be fair, sire,
you were never going to eat it.

05:10.601 --> 05:13.354
Yeah, I heard it was sour.
I don't care for sour stuff.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.522
I care about Bean.

05:14.605 --> 05:17.442
She's out of control
and I've tried everything.

05:17.525 --> 05:20.069
Yelling, screaming, everything.

05:20.153 --> 05:24.866
Ah, to think all the classy old bats
in this family led right to Bean.

05:24.949 --> 05:28.202
Carousing, taking her clothes off
every chance she gets.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.788
Doing God knows what with that elf.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.831
[groans]

05:31.914 --> 05:34.917
Bean hasn't been the same
since she lost her mom.

05:35.001 --> 05:38.421
Ah, Dagmar, you were my perfect queen. Regal. Kind. Talk all good and stuff.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.468
Not like Reptilicus.

05:43.551 --> 05:46.429
Huh. He thinks I am reptile?

05:47.847 --> 05:48.723
[sighs]

05:48.806 --> 05:51.934
I need some snakeroot to soothe my nerves.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.564
[yelling]

06:01.152 --> 06:05.656
[groans] You use your curtains to escape
one time and your dad's all like,

06:05.740 --> 06:06.866
"No more curtains."

06:06.949 --> 06:10.953
You know, if you don't sleep for 72 hours,
you become clinically insane.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.497
-So wakey-wakey, nutbag.
-[grunts]

06:12.580 --> 06:15.750
Fine, but I'll need a little something
to put the edge on.

06:15.833 --> 06:16.959
[queen continues yelling]

06:27.136 --> 06:28.888
I need "Oona's Little Helper."

06:28.971 --> 06:30.681
Oh, does she have a friend like me?

06:30.765 --> 06:32.100
No, she has no friends.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.977
She has nothing in her life except a drug
that makes her happy.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.145
Now, let's go steal it.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.695
Stealing from my stepmother's purse.

06:44.779 --> 06:45.947
Is that who I really am?

06:46.030 --> 06:47.156
It's exactly who you are.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.158
You're the type
to steal enough for your friends.

07:00.628 --> 07:04.257
I'm kinda scared to try this.
Will you guys peer pressure me?

07:04.340 --> 07:05.633
Sure thing, buddy.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.554
Seems our little emissary Luci

07:09.637 --> 07:12.682
is successfully corrupting
Tiabeanie's mind and soul.

07:12.765 --> 07:16.686
Oh, is this the one where the cat
and the elf are friends?

07:16.769 --> 07:21.107
Jerry, leave the highballs and,
I don't know, feed the peacocks.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.109
But they don't like me.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.825
I don't know.
I'm not really feeling anything.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.910
-Me, either.
-Me, either.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.496
Me, either. [echoing]

07:35.580 --> 07:36.914
Meither. Meither.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.251
Meither. Meither. Meither. [chuckles]

07:40.334 --> 07:43.129
Meither. What's happening?

07:43.754 --> 07:46.591
Wow! My God, you guys.
We should start a band.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.134
[rhythmic clapping]

07:50.595 --> 07:52.180
Yes! We sound amazing.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.182
We'll fix up an old carriage
and tour the country,

07:54.265 --> 07:55.641
playing what we want to play,

07:55.725 --> 07:58.436
never selling out, never splitting up.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.646
-Elfo, you're out of the band!
-What the hell?

08:00.730 --> 08:03.399
We're a duo now.
The fans didn't even notice.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.318
Luci, you fell off a balcony.
Were you pushed?

08:05.401 --> 08:06.736
We'll never find out.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.947
Dreams come true,
'cause I am a solo act now.

08:10.031 --> 08:13.117
The fans love my voice.
I have dreadlocks.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.120
But then I shave my head
like a true artist.

08:16.204 --> 08:20.041
Why is the crowd booing?
Oh, no. I'm the talentless one!

08:20.124 --> 08:21.459
Elfo, you came back.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.544
Luci, thought I pushed you--
We're together again.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.671
Let's get out there. We're back on top.

08:25.755 --> 08:29.050
Nothing can stop us now.
Oh, no. I have cancer. What?

08:29.759 --> 08:33.095
I dedicate this next song
to the memory of Bean.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.722
[rhythmic clapping]

08:44.857 --> 08:46.776
[all cheering]

08:48.736 --> 08:49.695
[grunts]

08:49.779 --> 08:50.613
[clucks]

08:50.696 --> 08:52.490
[all cheering]

09:14.512 --> 09:20.351
Wow. That is the most fun I've ever had
without remembering a single moment of it.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.270
[man] Ma'am, you're coming with us.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.773
You'll have to take me, too,
'cause I live here now.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.817
[Bean grunts]

09:27.900 --> 09:29.318
We've heard about you.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.154
Word 'round the gutter is
you're a right proper villain.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.408
'Course, I'm not threatened by that.
Women gotta support women.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.326
Crime is male-dominated, innit?

09:37.410 --> 09:41.497
If this world were run by women,
there wouldn't be so much crime.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.375
So our crime, yeah, is one for the ages.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.753
A real legendary caper.
We could use your help.

09:47.837 --> 09:51.632
Well, I'll have to confer
with my associates first.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.176
[whispering]
Guys, think we should do this?

09:54.260 --> 09:56.345
I've never done anything bad before.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.222
I've never done anything good before.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.809
I want to be bad.
I always admired Bad Elfo.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.020
Bad Elfo doesn't really exist.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.272
I would rather hang out with Bad Elfo.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.899
Okay, I'm gonna tell them yes.
That was a yes, right?

10:08.983 --> 10:10.026
Yes.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.070
[stammers] I only got in trouble once,
and, uh,

10:13.154 --> 10:16.324
Daddy Elfo, um, slapped me on the bum-bum.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.244
[in normal voice]
Uh, yeah, we're open to it.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.413
So, uh, what exactly are we heisting?

10:23.706 --> 10:24.832
Potatoes.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.127
Whoa. Hardcore.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.503
Hardcore is right.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.047
I been a potato thief ever since

10:31.130 --> 10:33.633
me dad never came back
from the Lemon Crusades.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.427
So, actual potatoes. Like from a garden.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.471
Yeah, that's where they hide 'em.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.723
Have you considered
stealing things of value?

10:40.806 --> 10:43.351
'Cause Bean here knows
where real treasures are buried.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.145
I know exactly what he's talking about.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.980
So what exactly are you talking about?

10:48.064 --> 10:50.941
Trust me.
I haven't led you astray in minutes.

10:56.614 --> 10:57.948
[all grunt]

11:04.747 --> 11:06.499
[straining]

11:10.544 --> 11:14.965
Okay, I guess I'm gonna do this,
unless someone talks me out of it.

11:15.049 --> 11:18.135
Hoodlums? Bad friend? Ignorant elf?

11:18.761 --> 11:21.138
There's a lot of sexual tension
between us.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.683
All right. Wish me luck.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.103
-[screams and grunts]
-[objects clatter]

11:27.186 --> 11:28.312
[Luci] Good luck.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.732
The family crypt.

11:31.816 --> 11:36.529
So this is where I'll end up one day.
Buried. Forgotten. Worm food.

11:36.612 --> 11:40.408
Oh, this is a bad time
to be coming down off of that high.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.536
Oh, my sweet Bee-Baw.

11:43.619 --> 11:46.831
Remember when you used to sit me
on your lap and tell me stories?

11:46.914 --> 11:50.000
Well, I'm in a gang now,
and I gotta take your crown.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.669
And your necklace.
And didn't you have...

11:53.212 --> 11:54.046
[squeaking]

11:54.130 --> 11:55.131
[snaps]

11:55.214 --> 11:57.383
Sometimes when you pull off
your grandma's jaw,

11:57.466 --> 12:00.219
it really makes you stop and wonder.
Am I doing the right--

12:00.302 --> 12:03.597
Come on!
This is a burglary, not a family reunion.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.768
Okay, that's everything!

12:11.355 --> 12:15.359
Whoa. Think of how many potatoes
we could get with this.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.278
If I spend any more time with my family

12:17.361 --> 12:19.363
they'll start asking why I'm not married.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.365
So you wanna drop me that rope?

12:21.449 --> 12:22.867
[grunts and sighs]

12:22.950 --> 12:24.118
Just so you know,

12:24.201 --> 12:27.788
I would've done the same thing
if you were a man. Now!

12:27.872 --> 12:29.081
-[Elfo and Luci grunt]
-[thud]

12:29.165 --> 12:30.583
[all laugh]

12:34.003 --> 12:36.297
[Luci] So, when are you getting married?

12:36.380 --> 12:38.007
[bell tolling]

12:39.925 --> 12:43.804
Hear ye, hear ye.
Royal court is now in session.

12:43.888 --> 12:48.225
Ah. Let's have a look
at this no-good pile of scum.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.643
Starting at the feet.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.645
Mud-covered crime boots.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.273
Legs muscled by years on the run.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.860
Obviously stolen belt. Nondescript torso.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.321
Moving up to the face area.

13:00.404 --> 13:04.366
Uh, weak chin, buck teeth, and...
Whoa!

13:04.950 --> 13:06.076
Hi, Dad.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.830
What the... You tryin' to tell me
my little girl is this guy?

13:09.914 --> 13:14.668
There is no way you're gonna convince me
my daughter is a criminal.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.671
Presenting victims one through nine.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.965
God damn it!

13:20.049 --> 13:22.051
[indistinct murmurs]

13:22.134 --> 13:23.219
[clucking]

13:23.302 --> 13:25.304
Look, I know I went a tad wild,

13:25.387 --> 13:29.433
but what do you expect from someone
who's got no control over her own destiny?

13:29.517 --> 13:32.561
So I turned to booze,
drugs and my evil little friend.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.647
[speaking through teeth]
Oh, my God, shut up.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.316
Your weird cat? I'll pulverize him.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.861
I'll pet him in the wrong direction.
I'll put a cucumber beside him.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.446
That drives them crazy.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.157
No, no, no, not him. I meant--

13:45.241 --> 13:49.078
She meant me. I'm so bad. Oh, I'm bad.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.706
No, you're not.
You're a marshmallow with legs.

13:52.790 --> 13:53.958
-[babbling]
-[chuckling]

13:57.336 --> 13:58.796
[laughing] Stop!

13:58.879 --> 14:02.550
[sighs] Well, I got into some shenanigans
in my day,

14:02.633 --> 14:04.510
but my mom never lost her head.

14:04.593 --> 14:05.845
We recovered this.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.597
Oh, that's Mom's head.
[gasps] Mom's head?

14:08.681 --> 14:12.852
Your daughter was caught ransacking
the royal tomb.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.938
You stole stuff from our dead family?

14:16.021 --> 14:19.608
Oh, I don't even know what to yell at you.
You take it.

14:19.692 --> 14:23.571
Why you... I oughta...
If I weren't so fat, I'd--

14:23.654 --> 14:26.073
Shut up! She gets the point.

14:26.156 --> 14:29.743
Bean, go to your room
while we decide what to do with you.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.997
And take Elfo,
so I know you're not having any fun.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.380
This has got to stop.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.757
[chuckles] Oh, come on,
you know you enjoyed it.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.092
[chuckles]

14:45.175 --> 14:47.136
Yeah. But it's gotta stop.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.097
What? Nuh-uh. I'm your demon, baby.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.475
We're magically linked,
like lollipops and rug fuzz.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.519
[slurping] It's fine.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.772
Listen, just stay away from me
for a while, okay?

14:58.856 --> 15:00.900
Go ruin someone else's life.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.153
Huh. Okay. [sniffles] Maybe I will.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.114
-[Elfo] Ow!
-[chuckles] Now I feel better.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.119
What the hell's wrong with my daughter?

15:12.202 --> 15:14.538
She's like a one-man wrecking woman.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.958
According to the holy books,
your first mistake was educating her.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.419
The sheer defiance of reason and decorum

15:20.502 --> 15:24.882
leads me to believe that Tiabeanie
is what they now call a teenager.

15:24.965 --> 15:29.470
That don't exactly explain
why she desecrated sacred remains.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.389
Don't worry, Ma.
I won't let her get away with it.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.976
Oh, we can spout crazy theories all day,

15:36.060 --> 15:39.563
but science suggests
a more logical explanation:

15:39.647 --> 15:42.441
That Bean is possessed by a demon!

15:43.317 --> 15:45.027
Oh, no, they're on to us.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.030
They'll know exactly what we're up to.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.115
You don't even know what we're up to.

15:50.199 --> 15:55.287
Oh, every day you say you'll tell me
and you never do.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.584
[Bean] Where are you taking me?

16:00.668 --> 16:04.630
A real nice place with ponies,
or whatever crap you like.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.800
Oh, come in. Come in.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.886
Make yourself comfortable
on the dissection table.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.847
What are you talking about?
And why are you here?

16:13.931 --> 16:16.350
Having a cookie, making blood.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.895
You'll be fine, sweetie.
Strap her down.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.065
Now, don't worry.
The straps are just for my safety

16:23.148 --> 16:24.733
as I flush out your demon.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.152
[gasps] Wait, you know about the demon?

16:27.236 --> 16:31.031
Of course! With my scientific training,
it was rather obvious.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.033
[Luci] Meow, guys. What up?

16:33.117 --> 16:35.536
Ah, your talking cat's here
to keep you company.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.372
Now, let's find that demon.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.665
[coughs]

16:39.748 --> 16:41.917
That's it, dear. Cough out your demon.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.044
Cough it out like a demonic loogie.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.754
[coughing]

16:45.838 --> 16:47.589
This powerful lodestone

16:47.673 --> 16:50.968
will extract the demon
using magnetraction.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.761
Ooh. Ah.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.762
Ow!

16:53.846 --> 16:56.765
Hey. Look at us hanging out
on the floor together.

16:57.850 --> 17:02.104
No demon could survive
this preposterous degree of jiggling.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.857
This is not good for my hangover.

17:04.940 --> 17:09.194
Oh, yeah, that's it! Crank harder.
You've got him on the run now. Whoo!

17:09.278 --> 17:14.074
Work those scrawny nerd arms.
Jiggle that demon back to Hell. Nice.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.369
[grunts] Alas, the demon remains,

17:17.453 --> 17:20.414
even after the application
of all three sciences.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.624
All three? Even smoke?

17:22.708 --> 17:26.628
Indeed. We scholars like to think
science has all the answers,

17:26.712 --> 17:30.549
but in the end,
it's just a bunch of unprovable nonsense.

17:30.632 --> 17:31.842
So now what?

17:31.925 --> 17:36.305
I suggest something based more in reality.
Religious magic.

17:36.388 --> 17:40.100
An exorcism, huh?
[groans] I don't like the sound of that.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.811
Let's do it,
but don't say it out loud again.

17:43.771 --> 17:44.897
Shut up, you.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.398
As it happens, sire,

17:46.482 --> 17:49.610
I am acquainted
with the world's foremost exorcist.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.028
Big Jo.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.906
His people are the sworn enemies
of demons.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.992
But I must warn you.
He creeps even me out.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.495
Ah, no one's too creepy for my daughter.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.371
[thunder cracking]

18:05.501 --> 18:06.960
[horse neighs]

18:14.760 --> 18:16.678
[thunder continues cracking]

18:22.476 --> 18:24.061
-[all scream]
-Oh, my!

18:24.144 --> 18:26.146
I get that a lot.

18:31.902 --> 18:35.489
Okay, Big Jo, she's asleep
in the bed chamber.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.242
I'm already in here. [all scream]

18:39.993 --> 18:42.996
I sense an evil presence.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.292
[whimpers]

18:50.045 --> 18:53.173
Oh, no. It's that accursed weirdo.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.759
We must act before our plan is discovered.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.471
Conceal thyself, demon.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.806
[electricity crackling]

19:03.559 --> 19:05.144
Fear not, Princess.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.896
I will soon have the demon
out of your body.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.441
[Luci] Uh, nobody in this body
but us princesses, man.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.863
Oh, wait, uh, just one princess.
Me, Princess Tia...

19:15.946 --> 19:18.991
Oh, God, what's my full name? Damn it.

19:19.074 --> 19:23.453
I shall soon cast thee out, demon,
with these sacred tools.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.746
[Luci] You're a sacred tool.

19:24.830 --> 19:29.376
Jokes are a sign of fear.
A fear that is well justified.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.004
[Luci] Hold on, there's something
I've always wanted to try.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.675
So cool! I didn't even know
that the human body could do this.

19:36.758 --> 19:37.843
[Bean] It can't.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.762
Out! Get out!

19:40.846 --> 19:42.556
Be gone, damn you!

19:42.639 --> 19:45.142
Ooh! Sounds like some quality exorcism.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.394
I was talking to you!

19:47.477 --> 19:49.521
Nobody talks to me like that,

19:49.605 --> 19:53.066
except my daughter and my wife.
And now you.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.111
[chanting in Latin]

20:01.575 --> 20:04.828
[Luci] Oh! No! It burns! It burns!

20:04.912 --> 20:06.830
It burns with boredom!

20:06.914 --> 20:08.207
[laughs]

20:08.290 --> 20:10.167
Come on. Liven it up a little.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.460
Leave this body!

20:11.543 --> 20:17.549
Allow this girl to resume her humble life
of obedience and sobriety and chastity.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.468
[Luci snickers] You've never met Bean,
have you?

20:19.551 --> 20:23.347
O Lord, our only God,
brother of the other God,

20:23.430 --> 20:26.892
grant me the power
to expel this vile spirit.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.361
[Luci] Fire doesn't hurt demons.
You're only hurting Bean.

20:37.444 --> 20:42.366
Exactly. Once the flesh is burned away,
the demon is revealed.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.369
Flesh burn, demon return.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.120
[Luci] Dude, she needs her flesh.

20:48.705 --> 20:51.124
Great, you're gonna make me
be the good guy?

20:51.208 --> 20:52.417
Ugh, I hate that.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.419
[Luci yelling]

20:56.088 --> 20:57.256
[retches]

20:58.006 --> 20:59.007
[Luci grunting]

21:01.802 --> 21:03.095
[panting]

21:03.178 --> 21:06.056
I saved your life.
Now, I can go back to ruining it.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.267
-[Luci grunts]
-Gotcha.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.311
Ah! You can't do this, man.
I want my lawyer.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.648
Uh, I'm in here. Don't say anything.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.318
[groans] What... what happened?

21:18.402 --> 21:21.154
You have been exorcised.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.324
Don't forget to take it easy today
and drink plenty of water.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.915
So is Luci really gone? Well, it depends what you mean by "gone."

21:34.293 --> 21:37.546
If you mean "carted away,
never to return," then, yes.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.256
Well, maybe it was for the best.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.759
Life with him was fun, but I probably
would have been dead in a few weeks.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.762
I will miss how he always
pointed out my foibles

21:45.846 --> 21:47.806
and mocked me ruthlessly.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.099
But we'll be okay.

21:49.182 --> 21:52.686
You'll be amazed how much fun I am
on my own.

21:52.769 --> 21:55.605
-[chuckles] That's not a daisy.
-What?

21:55.689 --> 21:58.400
[chuckles] You put a dandelion
in the daisy basket.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.359
So?

21:59.443 --> 22:03.280
So, we're making a daisy chain,
not a dandelion chain.

22:03.363 --> 22:06.241
Why even bother to call it a daisy chain
if you're just gonna--

22:06.325 --> 22:10.537
[crying] Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I lied.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.164
I'm not really fun.

22:12.247 --> 22:15.000
The pressure, it just got to me.
[gasps]

22:15.083 --> 22:20.505
And then the pressure to sustain the lie?
Oh, God, it was a nightmare.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.257
We have to find Luci.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.261
Dad.

22:26.345 --> 22:30.182
Oh, sweetie, I can see the sparkle
in your eyes is gone.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.808
It's such a relief.

22:31.892 --> 22:35.270
So where does that exorcist
keep the demons after he removes them?

22:35.354 --> 22:37.773
Keep them? Oh, he doesn't keep them.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.068
He disposes of them
with extreme prejudice.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.653
[Elfo] We can't let him destroy Luci.

22:43.737 --> 22:47.908
[sighs] So typical of my family
to get rid of my friends like this.

22:47.991 --> 22:51.078
I'm sure one day you'll wake up
with them trying to smother you.

22:51.161 --> 22:51.995
[Elfo] What?

22:52.079 --> 22:54.498
Never mind. Uh, grab a horse. Let's go!

22:54.581 --> 22:55.665
[horse neighs]

23:00.754 --> 23:04.883
So there I am, possessing the Duchess
and she has the nerve to drop dead.

23:04.966 --> 23:07.260
And I'm like, "Now where am I gonna live?"
Rude.

23:07.344 --> 23:10.764
Ugh. Well, if it isn't Stacianne LeBlott.

23:10.847 --> 23:13.308
It's LeBlatt. Yeah, it's French.

23:13.392 --> 23:17.312
Like I said on our first date,
nothing could be worse than this.

23:25.612 --> 23:28.573
[gasps] Watch out.
The road is blocked. Stop!

23:28.657 --> 23:31.743
-I can't. I only know how to crash.
-[both scream]

23:31.827 --> 23:33.161
[horses neigh]

23:34.329 --> 23:37.874
[chuckles] Look what we caught
in our little trap.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.584
What, now you're highwaymen?

23:39.668 --> 23:43.380
Highwaypeople.
We're a gender neutral kleptocracy.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.341
And we'll be taking these nice horsies.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.927
They go well with me neck sparklies.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.304
Hey, that's my grandmother's necklace.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.014
Or your grandfather's.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.518
This isn't a gender thing.
It's Bee-Baw's and I am taking it back.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.145
[grunting]

24:05.986 --> 24:08.530
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-[grunting]

24:08.613 --> 24:10.240
I'm normally a nice person.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.659
But we really need to save our friend.

24:13.952 --> 24:17.122
-And we're in kind of a hurry, so...
-[continues grunting]

24:17.205 --> 24:18.790
-[blow lands]
-[thief grunts]

24:22.335 --> 24:24.045
[horses neigh]

24:35.765 --> 24:37.642
This is, like, so unfair.

24:37.726 --> 24:41.646
I never got to haunt a house
or spook a dog or get married.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.148
[all groan]

24:43.231 --> 24:45.442
Oh, please, put me out of my misery.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.903
Prepare to be put out of your misery.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.446
[Luci] No!

24:56.119 --> 24:57.537
[chanting in Latin]

24:59.080 --> 25:01.875
I possessed your mother and she loved it!

25:01.958 --> 25:03.126
[screams]

25:04.377 --> 25:06.254
[screams]

25:06.338 --> 25:07.714
[gasps] You just killed my lawyer.

25:07.797 --> 25:11.760
You won't be needing him anymore.
Your appeal has been denied!

25:11.843 --> 25:15.388
Wait, wait, wait. I love you?
Big Jo, I love you!

25:17.766 --> 25:21.061
Cursed are those who consort with demons.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.271
[both grunting]

25:35.951 --> 25:39.788
It's all over, Big Jo.
I got the bottle and the knife.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.290
Well, I got whatever this is.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.959
-Elf.
-[gasps]

25:44.042 --> 25:46.378
Throw me the bottle.
I'll throw you the elf.

25:46.461 --> 25:47.295
[Elfo] Thank you.

25:49.673 --> 25:50.882
Okay, catch.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.679
Oh! You haven't defeated me yet.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.848
Now, you have!

26:03.979 --> 26:06.231
She risked her own life to save the demon.

26:06.314 --> 26:07.691
Remarkable.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.610
She's come along faster
than we ever dared dream.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.530
[Elfo grunts]

26:16.741 --> 26:19.119
No, no, no! Just pull out the cork.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.537
[Luci] Ow!

26:21.413 --> 26:23.623
Ta-da. Did ya miss me?

26:23.707 --> 26:26.918
Yes, but never fly into my mouth again.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.379
Hey, what's that roll-y, wagon-y sound?

26:34.426 --> 26:35.510
[clatters]

26:36.469 --> 26:38.263
[demons laughing]

26:43.685 --> 26:45.437
[Elfo] <i>Well, at least we saved Luci.</i>

26:45.520 --> 26:48.398
[Bean] <i>But we released evil</i>
<i>upon the world.</i>

26:48.481 --> 26:50.358
[Luci] <i>A happy ending for everyone.</i>
