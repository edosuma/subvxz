02:06.989 --> 02:11.458
The Ring of the Fisherman, which
bears the official papal seal,

02:11.659 --> 02:15.037
must be destroyed immediately
following the Pope's death.

02:16.629 --> 02:19.744
The Papal apartment is then
sealed for nine days of mourning,

02:20.645 --> 02:24.997
a period known as "Sede Vacante",
the time of the empty throne.

02:28.157 --> 02:30.919
Over the last several days,
Catholic leaders

02:30.920 --> 02:34.042
from every corner of the world
have flocked to Rome,

02:34.537 --> 02:38.646
shocked by the sudden death of
this progressive and beloved pope.

02:46.045 --> 02:50.020
Today, in St. Peter's Square,
the faithful pray that there is

02:50.021 --> 02:53.290
among them another leader
who can unite their church,

02:53.511 --> 02:57.410
which has been so riven by change
and dissent in recent years.

03:01.427 --> 03:03.757
As the body of the pontif passes by,

03:04.102 --> 03:06.999
we see prayers are being
offered by the Preferiti,

03:07.556 --> 03:12.951
favorites among those being considered
to succeed him as the Vicar of Christ.

03:20.535 --> 03:22.202
At the end of the mourning period,

03:22.521 --> 03:24.887
the College of Cardinals
will lock itself

03:24.888 --> 03:27.704
behind the doors of the
Sistine Chapel for Conclave.

03:27.739 --> 03:30.924
The process by which they
will choose a new leader

03:31.227 --> 03:33.333
for the world's one billion Catholics

03:33.700 --> 03:36.598
who now find their
church at a crossroads,

03:36.822 --> 03:39.984
its ancient traditions
threatened by a modern world.

03:49.078 --> 03:51.428
Attention: Control booth going online.

03:54.390 --> 03:55.816
We are powering up.

03:59.611 --> 04:01.748
Attention Category 1 personnel.

04:02.203 --> 04:04.482
Interlock areas are now restricted.

04:06.416 --> 04:08.638
You've blocked all access, Philippe.

04:08.948 --> 04:11.630
You are terrified because
you gave it your all.

04:11.631 --> 04:14.200
The accelerator should
never create antimatter.

04:14.460 --> 04:18.248
It's only three cylinders under high
security. I only ask you to wait.

04:19.012 --> 04:20.096
We can't wait any longer.

04:20.096 --> 04:22.652
Antimatter is only the beginning.
We will have free access.

04:23.167 --> 04:26.078
But listen, even with proper
calibration, we might not be prepared.

04:27.253 --> 04:28.949
Just call the director. Stop this.

04:30.524 --> 04:33.507
ATLAS underground is
now a restricted vault.

04:34.455 --> 04:35.739
Vittoria, Vittoria...

04:36.212 --> 04:37.436
Protons are being loaded.

04:37.606 --> 04:40.029
This will not blast us to
the other side, so, please.

04:41.753 --> 04:43.894
Powering on LHC magnets.

04:45.528 --> 04:49.582
Ionic stage in 4, 3, 2...

04:50.897 --> 04:52.553
Start the collision sequence.

04:53.072 --> 04:55.598
Vittoria, what did Phillipe want?

04:56.229 --> 05:00.367
He about shitted. We should
still wait. What do you think?

05:00.556 --> 05:04.182
It's now or never.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.817
Beam stability is good.
Take your places, people.

05:07.986 --> 05:10.088
ATLAS and CMS checked.

05:10.276 --> 05:13.437
Trigger is set. Collision is imminent.

05:18.225 --> 05:20.581
Let's hope the heavy
ion guys didn't mess up.

05:25.143 --> 05:27.064
Luminosity monitors operational.

05:27.753 --> 05:29.767
B-line has no restrictions.

05:30.006 --> 05:32.301
Enable beam capture.

05:32.336 --> 05:33.887
Accelerating the beam.

05:34.022 --> 05:35.840
Stage 1: Line up.

05:36.306 --> 05:37.902
Magnets to full field.

05:39.567 --> 05:41.640
Last P still too high.

05:41.676 --> 05:44.562
We are moving up the
luminosity 10 to 34.

05:44.731 --> 05:46.582
Eject particle beams.

05:47.983 --> 05:49.083
Filling the LHC.

05:51.740 --> 05:54.043
Fusion commenced.
We are back online.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.867
The merger may be any time.

05:57.201 --> 06:00.784
Particles in transition.

06:00.815 --> 06:04.920
Collisions are fixed and running.

06:05.568 --> 06:08.770
LHC injecting protons: Beam 1.

06:11.554 --> 06:12.943
Lock the feedback systems.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.549
Particles at 99% the speed of light.

06:17.104 --> 06:18.993
Colliding stable beams.

06:19.514 --> 06:21.237
Enact injection kicker.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.404
We have a signal on
the luminosity monitors.

06:26.783 --> 06:28.645
We have events.

06:34.256 --> 06:35.578
Protons are moving.

06:54.556 --> 06:56.581
We have created antimatter.

07:01.063 --> 07:03.889
The unknown has been created.

07:12.117 --> 07:13.837
Silvano, we have succeeded.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.781
We are now in God's hands, Vittoria.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.934
I am on my way.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.572
Silvano?

08:26.121 --> 08:26.962
Silvano!

08:49.030 --> 08:50.484
Oh, God.

08:51.514 --> 08:56.184
Help! Aiuto! Aiuto!

09:52.011 --> 09:56.453
- A swim might help your jet lag.
- I beg your pardon?

09:56.830 --> 09:59.155
The bags under your eyes.
It's five in the morning

09:59.993 --> 10:01.383
and you're from the Vatican.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.706
Crossed keys under the Triregnum.

10:05.173 --> 10:06.632
It's a papal symbol.

10:10.351 --> 10:13.645
Claudio Vicenze.
Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.

10:14.547 --> 10:15.852
Vatican Police?

10:17.486 --> 10:19.397
I was expecting another letter.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.362
My request for access to your archives.

10:24.977 --> 10:26.328
Shouldn't you be in Rome?

10:27.067 --> 10:28.770
Kind of a busy time for you guys, huh?

10:28.972 --> 10:30.594
In fact, I was in New York.

10:30.975 --> 10:34.543
A detail to the UN. I received a
phone call in the middle of the night.

10:34.750 --> 10:39.062
"Find Professor Robert Langdon.
A matter of great urgency."

10:39.773 --> 10:42.393
They said to show you this.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.756
The Illuminati? They disappeared
hundreds of years ago.

10:55.757 --> 10:56.480
Did they?

10:56.566 --> 10:58.639
Look at that again. It's an ambigram.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.992
It's the same image,
forward and backward.

11:01.154 --> 11:03.561
Now, that's common for a
symbol like a Yin and Yang

11:03.621 --> 11:04.783
or a swastika but... that's a word.

11:05.464 --> 11:09.968
That Illuminati ambigramatic symbol has
been considered a myth for 400 years.

11:10.479 --> 11:12.096
Supposedly, in the 16th century,

11:12.097 --> 11:15.381
some artist created it as a tribute
to Galileo's love of symmetry.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.401
It was only gonna be revealed when the
Illuminati had amassed enough power

11:19.652 --> 11:22.056
to resurface and carry
out their final goal.

11:22.228 --> 11:24.121
I wrote a book about it.

11:24.476 --> 11:25.973
Which is why you're here.

11:26.142 --> 11:28.330
"The Art of the Illuminati"
by Robert Langdon.

11:28.331 --> 11:29.031
Part One.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.473
I haven't been able to finish Part Two

11:31.474 --> 11:33.501
because I'm not allowed
access to your archives.

11:39.505 --> 11:41.873
It's remarkable. Similar.

11:42.067 --> 11:45.859
Someone is trying to make you believe the
Illuminati themselves have returned to Rome.

11:46.327 --> 11:47.992
Right after the death of a pope.

11:52.137 --> 11:55.405
Four cardinals were kidnapped from
their quarter's inside the Vatican

11:55.406 --> 11:57.273
sometime between 3
and 5 am this morning.

11:57.279 --> 12:02.525
Shortly afterward, that document was
sent to the office of the Swiss Guard

12:02.570 --> 12:03.858
along with the threat

12:04.028 --> 12:06.083
the Cardinals will be
publicly executed

12:06.241 --> 12:08.625
one per hour begining
at 8 pm tonight in Rome.

12:19.569 --> 12:20.754
The conclave?

12:20.768 --> 12:21.694
Was to begin today.

12:21.695 --> 12:23.887
We have postponed the
start for a few hours

12:23.889 --> 12:25.057
with the story of illness.

12:25.060 --> 12:27.628
There are no suspicions... yet.

12:28.168 --> 12:30.217
What do you want from me?

12:30.570 --> 12:37.032
These criminals, who sent this ambigram,
meant it as a taunt, a provocation.

12:37.036 --> 12:40.799
But Captain Olivetti think if you
can use it to learn their identity,

12:40.804 --> 12:43.937
perhaps we can stop this abomination.

12:47.568 --> 12:49.043
Why me?

12:49.907 --> 12:53.334
Your expertise. Your erudition.

12:53.342 --> 12:57.278
Your recent involvement
with certain church...

12:57.337 --> 12:58.775
shall we say... mysteries.

12:59.953 --> 13:04.233
I wasn't under the impression that
episode had endeared me to the Vatican.

13:04.239 --> 13:05.718
Oh, it didn't.

13:05.850 --> 13:09.369
But it did make you,
what is the word for...

13:09.377 --> 13:10.625
"formidable"?

13:11.087 --> 13:12.801
Formidable?

13:13.725 --> 13:16.560
A Vatican jet is standing
by twenty minutes from here.

13:16.565 --> 13:18.134
Will you come with me?

13:25.864 --> 13:27.130
Professor Langdon.

13:27.134 --> 13:31.346
You've spent your life searching for symbols
like the one you now hold in your hand.

13:31.382 --> 13:35.711
How much longer are we going to pretend
you have not already decided to come?

13:42.087 --> 13:45.583
If the Illuminati have
returned and are in Rome,

13:45.712 --> 13:48.677
we will hunt them down and kill them.

13:49.487 --> 13:53.348
The Illuminati did not become
violent until the 17th century.

13:53.351 --> 13:55.463
Their name means
'The Enlightened Ones'.

13:55.464 --> 13:57.936
They were physicists,
mathematicians, astronomers.

13:57.942 --> 14:00.619
They were concerned with the
church's inaccurate teachings

14:00.620 --> 14:02.816
and they were dedicated
to scientific truth.

14:02.817 --> 14:04.555
But the Vatican didn't like that.

14:04.556 --> 14:06.819
So, the church began
to, how did you say it?

14:06.932 --> 14:08.884
Oh. Hunt them down and kill them.

14:09.653 --> 14:11.984
Drove them underground

14:12.474 --> 14:14.767
into a secret society.

15:03.342 --> 15:05.072
- Professor Langdon.
- Yes?

15:05.073 --> 15:06.617
Welcome to Vatican City.

15:07.461 --> 15:11.035
Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector
General of the Vatican Police Force.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.014
My pleasure.

15:12.015 --> 15:12.898
This way please.

15:12.899 --> 15:15.658
We'll meet in the headquarters
of the Swiss Guard.

15:16.313 --> 15:20.262
- I thought you were Swiss Guard.
- No, uh, the Gendarmaria.

15:20.265 --> 15:23.669
We are responsible for everything
inside the Vatican walls

15:23.674 --> 15:27.247
with the exception of the
security of His Holiness...

15:27.252 --> 15:29.088
- Yeah.
- ... and the Apostolic Palace.

15:29.089 --> 15:29.914
That is Swiss Guard.

15:29.949 --> 15:33.143
<i>The Roman Carabinieri are here as</i>
well in an advisory capacity.

15:33.222 --> 15:35.326
So jurisdictionally this is...

15:35.332 --> 15:36.432
A goddamn nightmare.

15:43.228 --> 15:47.352
- Oh, yes. Pope Pius IX's great castration.
- I beg your pardon?

15:47.355 --> 15:53.066
1857. Pope Pius IX felt the
male form would inspire lust.

15:53.480 --> 15:58.130
So, he took a hammer and chisel and
'un-manned' hundreds of these statues.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.166
The plaster fig leaves were added later.

16:02.895 --> 16:06.350
Are you anti-Catholic,
Professor Langdon?

16:06.877 --> 16:09.923
No. I'm anti-vandalism.

16:13.369 --> 16:16.266
I urge you to guard your tone here.

16:16.332 --> 16:20.309
The Swiss Guard is a
calling, not a profession,

16:20.344 --> 16:24.881
and it encourages a certain civiltry.

16:25.077 --> 16:29.295
Commander Richter, the head of the
Guard, is a deeply spiritual man.

16:29.301 --> 16:31.616
He was close to the
late Pope. Understood?

16:32.068 --> 16:34.717
Look, I dont study symbols because
I consider them unimportant.

16:34.719 --> 16:37.134
Ceremony, traditions,
heavily mark our lives.

16:37.220 --> 16:40.226
I just hope I can help.
- So do I.

16:41.181 --> 16:43.048
You were my idea.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.862
Wait here. Please.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.603
Commander? Commander Richter?

17:09.068 --> 17:10.828
Doctor Vetra?

17:12.531 --> 17:16.414
I'm Commander Richter, principal of
the Swiss Guard. Thank you for coming.

17:18.775 --> 17:20.476
Oh. Professor Langdon.

17:20.482 --> 17:23.132
What a relief.
The symbologist is here.

17:23.133 --> 17:24.920
This way, please, Miss Vetra.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.084
The situation has changed.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.589
We received another
threat from the kidnapper.

17:32.035 --> 17:35.313
The canister was stolen from
my lab around noon yesterday.

17:35.318 --> 17:38.767
The intruder killed my research
partner, Silvano Paintivolio

17:38.775 --> 17:41.367
and mutilated him in
order to bypass security.

17:41.699 --> 17:43.747
We use retinal scanners.

17:44.344 --> 17:45.839
They cut out his eye.

17:46.986 --> 17:49.611
Is that your stolen canister, Ms. Vetra?

17:50.711 --> 17:53.619
- Where is that camera, number 86?
- It's wireless.

17:53.623 --> 17:56.183
It, too, was stolen. It could be
anywhere inside the Vatican walls.

17:56.185 --> 17:59.417
That canister contains an extremely
combustible substance called antimatter.

17:59.419 --> 18:02.342
We need to locate it immediately.
We evacuate Vatican City.

18:02.344 --> 18:04.907
I'm quite familiar with
incendiaries, Miss Vetra.

18:04.911 --> 18:07.169
I've never heard of
antimatter being used as such.

18:07.171 --> 18:10.440
Well, its never been generated
in significant quantities before.

18:10.445 --> 18:13.217
It's a way of studying the
origins of the universe.

18:13.222 --> 18:16.121
To try to isolate what some
people call "the God Particle".

18:16.123 --> 18:18.984
But there are implications
for energy, research--

18:18.985 --> 18:19.785
"God Particle"?

18:20.874 --> 18:23.103
What you call it isn't important.

18:23.105 --> 18:26.709
It's what gives all matter mass.
The thing without which we could not exist.

18:26.714 --> 18:31.290
You're talking about the moment of creation.
- Yes, in a way, I am.

18:31.963 --> 18:34.404
The antimatter is suspended there...

18:34.405 --> 18:37.937
in an airtight nano-composite shell
with electromagnets on each end.

18:37.947 --> 18:39.654
But if it were to
fall out of suspension,

18:39.655 --> 18:42.540
and come into contact with matter,
say with the bottom of the canister,

18:42.543 --> 18:44.909
then, the two opposing forces would
annihilate one another violently.

18:45.009 --> 18:47.543
What might cause it to
fall out of suspension?

18:47.544 --> 18:48.837
The battery going dead.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.852
Which it will just before midnight.

18:52.063 --> 18:53.834
What kind of annihilation? How violent?

18:54.022 --> 18:55.588
A cataclysmic event.

18:55.943 --> 18:59.744
A blinding explosion
equivalent to about 5 kilotons.

19:00.395 --> 19:03.690
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.916
Those are the exact
words the kidnapper used.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.679
We will destroy your four pillars.

19:12.423 --> 19:17.268
We will brand your Preferiti and
sacrifice them on the altars of science.

19:17.922 --> 19:20.260
Then bring your church down upon you.

19:21.106 --> 19:23.921
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

19:24.333 --> 19:28.446
A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.

19:34.292 --> 19:38.024
It's the ancient Illuminati threat.
Destruction of Vatican City through light.

19:38.360 --> 19:41.947
Four pillars. There's
your kidnapped cardinals.

19:42.659 --> 19:46.492
You didn't tell me they were the Preferiti,
the favorites to be named the next Pope.

19:48.953 --> 19:50.228
Play it again.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.906
We will destroy your four pillars.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.747
We will brand your Preferiti...

20:03.945 --> 20:04.715
Wait, stop it. Stop.

20:06.911 --> 20:08.144
Brand them?

20:10.735 --> 20:13.272
That's another Illuminati legend.

20:13.492 --> 20:17.390
This one says that there
are a set of five 'Brands'.

20:18.486 --> 20:19.982
Each one an ambigram.

20:20.174 --> 20:22.409
The first four are the
fundamental elements of science:

20:22.604 --> 20:24.443
earth, air, fire and water.

20:24.662 --> 20:26.399
Th fifth is a mystery.

20:29.076 --> 20:30.396
Maybe it's this.

20:31.362 --> 20:33.126
You said they'd be killed publicly.

20:33.575 --> 20:37.112
Yes. Revenge. For La Purga.

20:37.719 --> 20:39.029
La Purga?

20:40.548 --> 20:43.210
Geez, you guys don't even
read your own history, do you?

20:44.390 --> 20:49.592
1668. The church kidnapped
four Illuminati scientists

20:49.807 --> 20:52.690
and branded each one of them on the
chest with the symbol of the cross.

20:53.035 --> 20:55.588
To 'purge' them of their
sins and they executed them,

20:56.260 --> 20:57.970
threw their bodies out in the street

20:58.151 --> 20:59.708
as a warning to others
to stop questioning

20:59.908 --> 21:02.115
church rulings on scientific
matters. They radicalized them.

21:02.296 --> 21:06.247
The Purga created a darker,
more violent Illuminati.

21:06.427 --> 21:08.826
One bent on... on retribution.

21:09.492 --> 21:12.417
And look how they intend to
finally get it. Using anti-matter.

21:12.685 --> 21:16.682
Technology to destroy the church.
Science obliterates religion.

21:18.325 --> 21:19.411
Is there any more?

21:21.429 --> 21:24.054
...and sacrifice them
on the altars of science.

21:24.304 --> 21:26.934
Then bring your church down upon you.

21:27.168 --> 21:30.488
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

21:31.037 --> 21:35.173
A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.

21:35.373 --> 21:36.724
Path of Illumination?

21:40.549 --> 21:42.349
I need access to the Vatican archives.

21:44.657 --> 21:46.526
Professor, I don't think this
is the appropriate moment--

21:46.708 --> 21:48.931
Your petition has been
denied seven times.

21:49.124 --> 21:51.011
No, no. This has-
This has nothing to do with my work.

21:51.012 --> 21:53.697
The Path of Illumination
is a hidden trail through Rome itself

21:53.698 --> 21:55.529
that leads to the
Church of the Illumination.

21:55.714 --> 21:58.055
The place where the Illuminati
would meet in secret.

21:58.303 --> 22:03.528
If I can find the "Segno", the sign,
that marks the beginning of that path,

22:04.419 --> 22:05.672
the four churches along it.

22:05.673 --> 22:08.039
It may be where he intends
to murder your Cardinals.

22:08.374 --> 22:13.709
One every hour. At 8, 9, 10 and 11.
Then the device explodes at midnight.

22:14.327 --> 22:17.624
If we could figure out the first
church and get there before he does,

22:17.813 --> 22:19.034
maybe we could stop it.

22:19.212 --> 22:22.280
But I can't find the start of the
path until I get into the archives.

22:23.818 --> 22:25.392
Even if I wanted to help you,

22:25.551 --> 22:27.474
access to the archives
is only by written decree

22:27.661 --> 22:30.177
by the curator on the
Board of Vatican Librarians.

22:30.734 --> 22:32.590
Or by papal mandate.

22:32.763 --> 22:35.672
Yes, but, as you no doubt have
heard, the Holy Father is dead.

22:36.925 --> 22:38.507
What about il Camerlengo?

22:38.661 --> 22:41.483
The Camerlengo is just a priest
here. The former pope's chamberlain.

22:41.656 --> 22:45.112
Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest
in him during "Tempo Sede Vacante"?

22:53.122 --> 22:55.393
Fellas, you called me.

22:57.499 --> 22:58.862
His Holiness once told me

22:59.035 --> 23:02.151
the Pope is a man torn between
the real world and the divine.

23:02.834 --> 23:05.093
It seems the real world
is upon us tonight.

23:06.764 --> 23:09.936
I'm familiar with Illuminati lore
and the legend of the brandings.

23:10.570 --> 23:13.002
The Purga is a dark stain
on this church's history.

23:13.856 --> 23:16.160
I'm not surprised this ghost
has returned to haunt us.

23:18.985 --> 23:22.365
Commandante, have you begun a
search for this explosive device?

23:22.582 --> 23:24.135
Of course, but it could be anywhere.

23:24.293 --> 23:26.684
My primary concern at the moment
is the safety of the cardinals.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.561
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.

23:29.007 --> 23:30.871
As long as the cardinals
are in conclave,

23:30.872 --> 23:32.601
your security concerns
are at a minimum.

23:33.598 --> 23:34.910
Devote as many of your people--

23:35.130 --> 23:37.198
Signore, if you are about to suggest
a naked eye search

23:37.199 --> 23:38.896
of the entire Vatican City,
I will tell you...

23:38.897 --> 23:40.114
- Commander.
- ... I do not have the people.

23:40.299 --> 23:42.379
Although I am not His Holiness,

23:42.562 --> 23:44.934
when you are addressing me,
you are addressing this office.

23:44.935 --> 23:45.866
Do you understand?

23:47.713 --> 23:50.253
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.953
Now, you said the image on the screen
was illuminated by artificial light.

23:56.023 --> 23:59.709
Might I suggest methodically cutting
power to various sections of the city?

24:00.323 --> 24:01.895
When the image on the
screen goes dark,

24:01.896 --> 24:04.097
you'll have a more specific
idea of the camera's location.

24:08.384 --> 24:11.575
Dr. Vetra, beside yourself
and your research partner,

24:11.809 --> 24:14.060
who else knew about
this antimatter project?

24:15.121 --> 24:16.666
No one but the research team.

24:17.606 --> 24:19.405
This project was strictly confidential.

24:19.780 --> 24:21.641
But Silvano kept detailed journals.

24:21.642 --> 24:24.604
If he told anyone else
about what we were doing,

24:24.605 --> 24:25.938
he would have made a note of it.

24:26.272 --> 24:27.661
And do you have these journals?

24:27.847 --> 24:29.793
I can have them flown here
from Geneva in an hour.

24:30.227 --> 24:31.130
Please.

24:33.173 --> 24:34.124
Professor Langdon.

24:45.490 --> 24:47.315
Mr. Langdon.

24:47.590 --> 24:50.285
You are correct that I may
grant you access to the archives.

24:52.662 --> 24:54.010
Thank you, Padre.

24:54.225 --> 24:57.687
I said that you are correct that I may,
not- not that I will.

24:59.886 --> 25:02.840
Christianity's most sacred
codes are in that archive.

25:04.206 --> 25:07.220
Given your recent
entanglement with the church,

25:07.426 --> 25:11.281
there is a question I'd like to ask you
first, here, in the office of His Holiness.

25:18.635 --> 25:19.877
Do you believe in God, Sir?

25:23.724 --> 25:27.643
Father, I simply
believe that religion...

25:27.859 --> 25:30.355
I did not ask you if you
believe what man says about God.

25:31.236 --> 25:32.673
I asked if you believe in God.

25:35.957 --> 25:37.353
I'm an academic.

25:38.665 --> 25:42.977
My mind tells me I will
never understand God.

25:44.166 --> 25:45.405
And your heart?

25:48.317 --> 25:50.177
Tells me I'm not meant to.

25:51.934 --> 25:54.980
Faith is a gift that
I have yet to receive.

26:01.691 --> 26:03.447
Be delicate with our treasures.

26:10.878 --> 26:12.587
- The archives are this way.
- Professor Langdon?

26:14.965 --> 26:17.689
If this path really leads to
the Church of Illumination,

26:18.111 --> 26:20.049
that may be where they've
hidden the antimatter.

26:20.235 --> 26:22.053
The shining star at the end
of the path. I thought so, too.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.175
Follow the path and we may find
the canister at the end of it.

26:25.358 --> 26:26.738
Can you deactivate the device?

26:26.935 --> 26:29.860
I can change the canister's batteries as long
as we have more than five minutes of life.

26:30.032 --> 26:33.212
That would give us another 24
hours to get it safely back to CERN.

26:36.376 --> 26:38.300
- Robert Langdon.
- Vittoria Vetra.

26:39.159 --> 26:42.645
Are you really a symbologist
or was he mocking you?

26:43.025 --> 26:44.822
No. Both. You're a physicist?

26:45.025 --> 26:47.695
Bioentanglement Physics.
The interconnective life systems?

26:47.696 --> 26:48.396
Okay.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.356
Your project... it was to give
towards the energy research?

26:52.641 --> 26:53.724
Eventually, yes.

26:53.926 --> 26:57.063
One pack of antimatter could
power an entire city for a month.

26:58.181 --> 26:59.996
Or tonight, I guess, destroy one.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.715
What are we looking for in the archives?
- A banned volume written by Galileo.

27:05.234 --> 27:08.814
- Galileo was Illuminati?
- Yeah, and an obedient Catholic.

27:09.288 --> 27:11.488
Who didn't think the church
and science were enemies

27:11.700 --> 27:13.930
but just a different language
telling the same story.

27:14.123 --> 27:15.685
Anyone of like minds could find
the Church of Illumination.

27:15.920 --> 27:20.181
But he couldn't exactly advertise its
location, so he created a coded path.

27:22.382 --> 27:24.736
Richter has started to turn
off the power at various rates.

27:25.015 --> 27:26.254
It will be back on in a minute.

27:27.837 --> 27:31.368
Then some unknown Illuminati
master sculpted four statues.

27:31.718 --> 27:34.203
Each one a tribute to one
of the fundamental elements:

27:34.402 --> 27:36.777
earth, air, fire, water.

27:36.987 --> 27:39.243
And placed the statues out in
public, in churches throughout Rome.

27:39.454 --> 27:42.303
Each statue held a clue
pointing to the next.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.838
At the end of the path was
the Church of Illumination.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.812
If you could find that,
you were one of them.

27:48.170 --> 27:50.710
What makes you think he's going to
murder the cardinals in the churches?

27:51.048 --> 27:55.823
The Illuminati called those four churches
by the special name "L'altare de la Scienza".

27:57.164 --> 27:59.418
Sacrifice them on the
altars of science, he said.

27:59.826 --> 28:00.723
Exactly.

28:04.579 --> 28:06.997
Oh, wow. Look at this.

28:31.073 --> 28:32.969
Excuse me. Signori.

28:35.508 --> 28:38.205
Cardinal Strauss, have you
been informed of the situation?

28:38.206 --> 28:38.950
Yeah.

28:39.261 --> 28:43.378
My belief is we should proceed
with the sealing of conclave.

28:43.486 --> 28:45.047
At this late hour?

28:45.416 --> 28:47.099
That would be highly unorthodox.

28:47.104 --> 28:50.612
And, yet, was ensured to wrought
my power in great elective.

28:50.655 --> 28:52.639
The cruelest honor in Christendom.

28:52.642 --> 28:55.703
I have no personal ambitions, Patrick.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.283
Only those I hold for my church.

28:58.289 --> 29:02.733
St. Peter's church, which is someday
taken at its most vulnerable moment.

29:02.734 --> 29:04.308
And this is not a coincidence.

29:04.309 --> 29:08.094
The church will not fall in a
day. We must evacuate Vatican City.

29:08.129 --> 29:12.594
That is exactly what they
want. Publicity and panic.

29:12.603 --> 29:16.186
No. We must not give them
oxygen for the media fire.

29:16.256 --> 29:19.233
But the people in St. Peter's Square?

29:19.268 --> 29:22.566
Care deeply about
their church, as we do.

29:22.681 --> 29:25.584
Their faith will sustain them.

29:25.588 --> 29:28.157
Their faith will not protect
them from an explosion.

29:29.790 --> 29:33.295
We are all bound for heaven
eventually, are we not?

29:34.264 --> 29:37.644
Spoken like one who has enjoyed the
blessings of a long and full life.

29:37.805 --> 29:42.500
Patrick, do not confuse the power
of the office you temporarily hold

29:42.504 --> 29:45.356
with your true place
here at the Vatican.

29:46.775 --> 29:49.910
You were a favorite of His Holiness.

29:49.935 --> 29:53.988
But His Holiness is with his father now.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.083
Mea culpa.

29:57.416 --> 29:59.406
Seal the doors.

30:13.181 --> 30:15.578
Everyone outside.

31:07.358 --> 31:08.505
This way, please.

31:09.539 --> 31:11.337
Oh. Beautiful.

31:15.731 --> 31:17.671
The chambers are hermetic vaults.

31:17.706 --> 31:21.900
Oxygen is kept at the lowest possible
level. It is a partial vacuum inside.

31:21.908 --> 31:24.220
So, extended stays are not recommended.

31:24.736 --> 31:28.088
So, don't panic if you
feel light headed at first.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.328
I'll be just outside the door,

31:41.606 --> 31:43.878
watching you, Mr. Langdon.

32:30.803 --> 32:33.871
Conclave will go on without us.

32:34.085 --> 32:37.070
It must. Now of all times.

32:37.185 --> 32:40.091
May God forgive you
for what you have done.

32:48.018 --> 32:50.221
Father, if God has issues,

32:50.607 --> 32:52.867
they won't be with what I've done.

32:54.033 --> 32:56.460
They will be with what I'm about to do.

33:17.228 --> 33:22.570
It was confiscated from the Netherlands
by the Vatican just after Galileo died.

33:22.605 --> 33:24.878
I've been petitioning to see it
for about ten years.

33:24.928 --> 33:26.596
Ever since I realized what was in it.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.963
What makes you so sure
that this thing is there?

33:30.364 --> 33:31.232
The number 503.

33:31.239 --> 33:35.458
I kept seeing it, over and over
again. In Illuminati letters.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.124
Scribbled in the margins.
Sometimes just signed '503'.

33:38.137 --> 33:40.448
It's a numeric clue, but, to what? Five?

33:40.452 --> 33:42.813
Well, that's a medieval
number to the Illuminati.

33:42.817 --> 33:46.064
There's the pentagram. Pythagoras.
Dozens of other examples in science.

33:46.066 --> 33:46.985
But what about 3?

33:47.052 --> 33:50.403
It didn't make sense, until I thought:
What if it's Roman numerals?

33:50.407 --> 33:54.343
DIII.
- D3. Galileo's third text.

33:54.378 --> 33:58.475
Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma.

34:09.827 --> 34:13.348
Just a few days with this and I
could've actually finished my book.

34:13.384 --> 34:17.179
And sold dozens of copies
at the Harvard bookstore.

34:17.214 --> 34:19.308
Il Diagramma Veritatis.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.552
Diagram of Truth.

34:22.056 --> 34:24.405
I know about the
Dialogo and the Discorsi.

34:24.440 --> 34:28.333
Galileo laid out his theories about
the earth revolving around the sun.

34:28.368 --> 34:30.618
Right. It said the earth was not
the center of some universe

34:30.619 --> 34:31.725
with heaven above, hell below,

34:32.112 --> 34:33.561
as the church had said it was.

34:33.563 --> 34:35.905
So, they forced him to
recant his second book.

34:35.908 --> 34:37.081
But what was this one?

34:37.089 --> 34:38.835
This is how he got the word out.

34:38.835 --> 34:41.605
This is the truth. Not what
the Vatican forced him to write.

34:41.639 --> 34:45.280
Smuggled out of Rome, printed in
Holland on setched papyrus. See?

34:45.282 --> 34:47.947
That way, any scientist
that was caught with a copy

34:47.947 --> 34:51.638
could just throw it in water and
Galileo's heresy would disolve. Disappear.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.842
Between that and Vatican burnings

34:54.847 --> 34:58.000
it's possible this is the
only copy that remains.

34:58.079 --> 35:00.072
And if I'm correct,

35:00.121 --> 35:04.764
the segno is hidden on page number...

35:04.771 --> 35:06.046
Five.

35:07.014 --> 35:08.672
Yeah.

35:14.152 --> 35:16.442
Do you need help with the Latin?

35:17.032 --> 35:18.239
Sure.

35:24.864 --> 35:29.870
Movement of the planets,
elliptical orbits, idiosyntricity...

35:32.402 --> 35:36.048
Sorry. I don't think there's anything
that could be interpreted as a...

35:36.049 --> 35:36.959
Wait, wait, wait.

35:37.515 --> 35:38.696
Do that again.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.013
What is that?

35:44.665 --> 35:47.684
Wait. It's a watermark.
And there's a line of text.

35:47.817 --> 35:49.127
Go back.

35:50.813 --> 35:52.417
It's in English.

35:52.452 --> 35:54.000
English?

35:54.007 --> 35:55.369
Why English?

35:55.439 --> 35:58.643
English wasn't used in the
Vatican. It was too polluted.

35:58.649 --> 36:04.186
It's free thinking. It was the language
of radicals, like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

36:04.191 --> 36:04.948
Here's another one.

36:04.951 --> 36:10.072
"The path of light is laid a sacred test.
" Would you write this down as I dictate?

36:10.075 --> 36:11.875
Sorry, Professor. No time.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.031
Yeah, yeah.
Well, what the hell? Yeah.

36:35.066 --> 36:36.994
Twenty minutes till eight.
Where are we headed?

36:36.995 --> 36:39.057
Hold on. Hold on.
I'll tell you in a minute.

36:39.058 --> 36:40.478
Here. Let me see that page again.

36:46.637 --> 36:48.222
Where did you get that paper?

36:48.882 --> 36:50.209
We borrowed it.

36:50.245 --> 36:53.607
"From Santi's earthly tomb,
the demon's hole..."

36:53.608 --> 36:54.481
Are you insane?

36:54.483 --> 36:57.514
"...across Rome the mystic
elements unfold."

36:58.583 --> 37:01.549
"The path of light is
laid in a sacred test."

37:01.584 --> 37:04.253
"Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

37:05.083 --> 37:07.934
You removed a document
from the Vatican archives?

37:08.514 --> 37:09.590
She did.

37:14.258 --> 37:16.628
"From Santi's earthly tomb..."

37:16.632 --> 37:19.318
- The first marker is at Santi's tomb.
- Yeah.

37:19.592 --> 37:22.134
- But who's Santi?
- Raphael.

37:22.138 --> 37:24.863
- Raphael? The sculptor?
- Yeah. Santi was his last name.

37:24.991 --> 37:28.834
- So, the path starts at Raphael's tomb?
- Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.

37:28.978 --> 37:32.293
- Isn't the Pantheon a church?
- The oldest Catholic church in Rome.

37:51.418 --> 37:54.298
I just pulled a dozen
of my best men for this.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.136
You better be right.

37:56.139 --> 37:58.123
This is one of the busiest
spot in all of Rome.

37:58.125 --> 37:59.908
You can never get away
with it. It's impossible.

37:59.909 --> 38:00.636
The poem implies--

38:00.641 --> 38:03.155
The poem? Unbelievable.

38:03.390 --> 38:07.817
I'm basing this operation on an American's
interpretation of a 400 year old poem.

38:08.021 --> 38:10.874
Well, the information we have
clearly refers to Raphael's tomb

38:10.878 --> 38:12.581
and Raphael's tomb is
inside that building.

38:12.587 --> 38:16.896
And because the Vatican destroyed all
of the pagan statues in the late 1800s,

38:16.946 --> 38:17.740
if this is the first marker,

38:18.341 --> 38:20.367
whatever clues were here to lead
us to the next are sure gone by now.

38:20.417 --> 38:22.544
The path is dead. So, this
is it. Your only chance.

38:25.767 --> 38:27.224
Seperate approaches.

38:27.234 --> 38:30.242
No closer than two blocks and
no uniforms. Three minutes.

38:30.761 --> 38:32.926
I'll need a set of eyes inside.

38:38.410 --> 38:41.889
Excuse me. Two men with symmetric black suits
and earpieces? They're hardly disguised.

38:41.895 --> 38:43.624
That's what I have.
- Well, fine. I'll go in.

38:43.626 --> 38:44.776
You don't have communication.

38:44.777 --> 38:46.877
You can't carry a walkie talkie.
It's too conspicuous.

38:46.879 --> 38:48.746
Tourists have cell phones, don't they?

38:48.750 --> 38:50.600
No, no. You can't send
her in there alone.

38:51.849 --> 38:53.633
All right. I won't.

39:05.037 --> 39:07.565
Don't look so anxious.
We're supposed to be married.

39:08.578 --> 39:11.100
Well, maybe we're not
getting along today, hmm?

39:13.239 --> 39:14.233
Hold my hand.

39:16.296 --> 39:18.413
- But don't crush it.
- Sorry.

39:18.787 --> 39:20.532
Nervous newlywed.

39:24.139 --> 39:25.925
Ooh. Look, honey. The oculus.

39:26.425 --> 39:28.912
That could be the
demon's hole in the poem.

39:28.936 --> 39:30.842
Why are the tombs at an angle?

39:31.058 --> 39:33.555
They're facing east to
worship the rising sun.

39:33.559 --> 39:34.909
But this is a Christian church.

39:34.913 --> 39:38.201
New religions often adopt
the existing customs and holidays

39:38.202 --> 39:40.010
to make conversion less of a shock.

39:40.577 --> 39:42.334
Like the 25th of December.

39:42.339 --> 39:45.052
It's the pagan celebration
of the unconquered sun.

39:45.055 --> 39:47.684
It also makes a handy date
for the birth of Christ.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.299
- Let's check the recesses.
- Okay.

39:49.467 --> 39:52.103
I'll go to the right and
I'll meet you in 180 degrees.

39:54.618 --> 39:56.117
Follow me, please.

39:56.827 --> 40:00.525
Now, the Pantheon, which
means 'Temple of all Gods',

40:00.560 --> 40:06.637
was originally built as a temple to
all the gods of ancient Rome in 27 BC.

40:07.102 --> 40:12.457
Although the building is usually
credited to Agrippa of Damascus...

40:13.190 --> 40:14.146
Robert!

40:16.467 --> 40:18.078
Robert!

40:20.622 --> 40:23.360
It's Raphael's tomb,
but it's the wrong one.

40:23.361 --> 40:24.427
What are you talking about?

40:24.428 --> 40:28.925
It was moved here in 1759, a century
after Diagramma was published.

40:28.942 --> 40:30.703
Where was he originally buried?

40:31.577 --> 40:32.840
Urbino, I think.

40:32.844 --> 40:35.624
Santi's earthly tomb. What could
posssibly be Santi's earthly tomb?

40:38.736 --> 40:43.657
Damn it! Santi's tomb. It must
mean the chapel that he built.

40:43.661 --> 40:45.390
He's not buried in it. He designed it.

40:45.393 --> 40:49.416
The demon's hole. It's not that oculus.
It's an undercroft. It's a crypt.

40:49.418 --> 40:50.891
Are there any questions?

40:51.036 --> 40:53.030
Yes. Yes!

40:53.217 --> 40:56.647
Did Raphael Santi ever design
a chapel with an ossuary anex

40:56.648 --> 40:59.734
in an angel figure commissioned
by the Catholic church?

41:01.200 --> 41:03.891
I'm sorry. I can only think of one.

41:04.601 --> 41:06.552
One is good.

41:06.588 --> 41:07.885
Wrong? What do you mean wrong?

41:07.889 --> 41:11.367
It's the Chigi chapel in the
Church of Santa Maria del Popolo.

41:11.369 --> 41:14.815
It was once called Capella della
Terra, the Chapel of the Earth.

41:14.819 --> 41:17.317
Earth. The first element. That's it.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.704
- You're certain about the Pantheon?
- We have four minutes.

41:19.708 --> 41:22.598
Back to the Vatican.

41:22.683 --> 41:24.670
Back to the Vatican?
You-You can't.

41:24.671 --> 41:27.222
Commandante, if you care at all about
your church, you'll listen to me.

41:27.226 --> 41:28.373
My church?

41:30.253 --> 41:33.036
My church comforts the sick and dying.

41:33.043 --> 41:36.656
My church feeds the hungry.
What does your church do, Mr. Langdon?

41:37.733 --> 41:40.679
That's right. You don't have one.

41:41.732 --> 41:43.639
Take him if you want. I'm done with him.

41:56.020 --> 41:58.054
All right, this makes sense.
Look, look, look!

41:58.055 --> 41:59.265
Right in front of the church.

41:59.300 --> 42:01.244
An obelisk. A lofty pyramid.

42:01.247 --> 42:03.824
The Egyptian symbol
adopted by the Illuminati.

42:03.937 --> 42:05.859
If he's going to kill him,
he'll do it here.

42:22.348 --> 42:23.678
Eight o'clock.

42:51.905 --> 42:54.543
No. No. Here. It's an Annulus.

43:22.111 --> 43:24.011
Which one is the Chigi Chapel?

43:24.312 --> 43:26.116
Must be in one of these areas.

44:30.017 --> 44:32.132
Pyramids in a Catholic church.

44:32.467 --> 44:35.593
This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel.

44:53.467 --> 44:55.314
The Demon's Hole.

44:58.143 --> 45:00.906
Yeah, but it's askew. Come here.

45:07.952 --> 45:10.064
Give me your flashlight.

45:10.182 --> 45:11.525
What's that?

46:08.620 --> 46:13.494
My Savior Christ will be my judge,
to testify that my voice is His.

46:13.496 --> 46:17.956
For I believe that He should
be chosen for the sake of God.

46:39.515 --> 46:45.366
I wish to Pontifex,
Dominicus Scolamiero.

46:54.682 --> 46:58.637
I wish to Pontifex, Eduardo Rossi.

46:58.687 --> 47:00.825
They are voting for themselves
to prevent a majority.

47:01.833 --> 47:03.595
They're waiting for the
Preferiti to be rescued.

47:05.430 --> 47:08.100
Perhaps we should, as well, yes?

47:26.304 --> 47:28.067
Not until the smoke is white

47:28.068 --> 47:31.782
will the College of Cardinals
have chosen a new Holy Father.

47:31.787 --> 47:36.057
For now the Vatican seat of
ultimate power remains vacant.

47:41.986 --> 47:44.539
Get the body out of there.
Search the rest of the building.

47:45.542 --> 47:47.100
- Chartrand!
- Sir.

47:47.315 --> 47:49.264
Outside a perimeter.
Secure, but invisible.

47:49.269 --> 47:51.760
No lights, no guns.
Nobody knows. Understand?

47:51.761 --> 47:52.701
Yes, sir.

47:56.495 --> 47:58.143
Is it Raphael?

47:58.795 --> 48:00.792
The chapel is Raphael.

48:01.215 --> 48:03.618
But the sculptures are Bernini.

48:06.172 --> 48:09.363
The unknown Illuminati master?

48:10.165 --> 48:11.798
Bernini?

48:12.845 --> 48:16.318
- He worked for the church.
- Almost exclusively.

48:16.741 --> 48:20.000
But the Illuminati were infiltrators.

48:20.692 --> 48:23.807
There wasn't a powerful organization
on earth they didn't penetrate,

48:23.809 --> 48:26.325
including the Vatican,
by hiding in plain sight.

48:30.943 --> 48:32.719
Habakkuk and the Angel.

48:33.379 --> 48:36.344
He's the prophet that predicted
the annihilation of the earth.

48:36.545 --> 48:40.616
"Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

48:44.286 --> 48:46.214
This is the first marker.

48:46.308 --> 48:48.019
The path is a line.

49:00.608 --> 49:02.063
Southwest.

49:02.164 --> 49:03.778
It was pointing southwest.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.422
Earth, air, fire, water.

49:05.423 --> 49:09.200
We're looking for a Bernini sculpture
having something to do with air.

49:09.202 --> 49:11.911
The second church is
somewhere southwest of here.

49:11.946 --> 49:13.551
You're sure this time?

49:13.586 --> 49:16.378
I need a map showing
all the churches of Rome.

49:19.679 --> 49:21.373
I could use it now.

49:56.587 --> 49:59.492
The purple layers with these black
crosses represent the churches.

49:59.666 --> 50:03.447
But nothing intersects the line until
it hits... until it hits St. Peter's.

50:03.452 --> 50:05.681
Michelangelo designed
St. Peter's, not Bernini.

50:05.684 --> 50:09.354
Michelangelo designed the Basilica.
Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.

50:09.488 --> 50:12.601
The second marker must be a
statue in St. Peter's Square.

50:17.893 --> 50:20.209
It's ten minutes to nine.
Can you go any faster?

50:20.777 --> 50:23.535
Not unless you want the full
attention of the world press.

50:31.771 --> 50:34.958
No majority in the first vote,

50:34.959 --> 50:40.695
but Cardinal Baggia from
Italy is the clear favorite...

50:40.697 --> 50:47.216
Still no new Pope, but Cardinal Guidera
from Spain has the best chance...

50:47.218 --> 50:53.470
The more conceivable candidate could
be Cardinal Ebner from Germany...

50:54.439 --> 50:57.039
Stem cell research is murder!

50:58.112 --> 51:00.821
You condemn sick people to death.

51:00.828 --> 51:02.580
Man is not God.

51:14.692 --> 51:16.348
There. Another obelisk.

51:16.351 --> 51:19.409
Check the crowd. It's almost
nine. He's got to be here already.

51:53.129 --> 51:55.218
Must be a hundred statues up there.

51:55.871 --> 51:58.853
None of them are angels.
Those are all saints.

51:59.295 --> 52:03.331
How in God's name would anyone
create a sculpture about air?

52:10.802 --> 52:12.233
Bas relief. Of course.

52:12.468 --> 52:13.526
It's still a sculpture.

52:13.527 --> 52:15.273
Check the ground.
Look at the carvings.

52:15.946 --> 52:18.009
Look for another having
something to do with air.

52:37.818 --> 52:40.600
Vento Ponente. West wind.

52:42.002 --> 52:42.980
Vittoria.

52:43.640 --> 52:44.965
Here it is.

52:45.700 --> 52:48.553
West wind. An angel blowing
out five streaks of air.

52:48.561 --> 52:50.035
This is it.

53:51.561 --> 53:53.187
Call the police!

53:54.568 --> 53:56.199
Call an ambulance!

54:05.843 --> 54:06.905
He's still alive.

54:21.341 --> 54:24.186
His chest.
They punctured his lungs.

55:40.344 --> 55:42.409
"And you squeezed the life
out of a bishop of Rome."

55:43.110 --> 55:45.785
And he's actually claiming responsibility
for the death of His Holiness.

55:46.522 --> 55:48.311
That's ridiculous. He died of a stroke.

55:49.306 --> 55:51.897
It impliess the Illuminati murdered
him with his own medication.

55:52.631 --> 55:53.447
What?

55:55.043 --> 55:56.109
It's on here.

55:56.666 --> 56:00.919
"With man's solution
we stilled his heart."

56:01.169 --> 56:03.220
"With his own needle
did we pierce his unholy vein."

56:03.456 --> 56:06.591
Did the Holy Father take any
kind of medication by injection?

56:06.875 --> 56:07.892
Tinzaparin.

56:09.005 --> 56:10.668
He had thrombophlebitis.

56:10.931 --> 56:13.106
He took an injection every
day, but no one knew that.

56:13.820 --> 56:15.008
Someone knew it.

56:15.355 --> 56:17.801
Well, he had health concerns
and seizures, as well.

56:18.503 --> 56:20.703
But he took steps to make
sure he was watched for safety.

56:20.889 --> 56:24.903
He didn't want it made public,
so we have no reason to discuss it.

56:25.085 --> 56:27.287
Tinzaparin is lethal
in the wrong dosage.

56:27.886 --> 56:31.483
An overdose could cause massive
internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages.

56:31.933 --> 56:33.414
It might look like a stroke at first,

56:33.597 --> 56:35.532
but in few days,
his body would show signs.

56:35.701 --> 56:36.752
This could easily be examined.

56:36.753 --> 56:38.364
Ms. Vetra, in case
you're not aware of it...

56:38.540 --> 56:41.506
Papal autopsy is
prohibited by Vatican law.

56:42.189 --> 56:45.969
We're not going to defile his Holiness body
just because of these claims.

56:45.970 --> 56:47.519
But why would they
send this letter now?

56:47.687 --> 56:48.978
In order to cause panic.

56:49.248 --> 56:51.266
"The sun will blind at midnight..."

56:51.446 --> 56:53.832
"and neither police nor
professors can stop it."

56:54.695 --> 56:56.125
He knows I'm here.

56:56.311 --> 56:58.608
Obviously, they were hoping
this letter would become public.

56:58.927 --> 57:00.860
We might be wise to preempt
their next attempt

57:00.861 --> 57:02.300
by making an announcement of our own.

57:02.751 --> 57:05.723
- To refute this absurd claim.
- That's out of the question.

57:06.051 --> 57:09.208
Cardinal Strauss has insisted this
entire matter be kept internal.

57:09.378 --> 57:11.471
He shouldn't even be aware of it.
He's locked in conclave.

57:11.631 --> 57:15.220
His final instructions, before
sealing the doors, were very clear.

57:15.551 --> 57:18.482
Cardinal Strauss does not
dictate Vatican protocols.

57:18.757 --> 57:22.190
And to say, yet, technically,
now that conclave has begun,

57:22.191 --> 57:25.448
it is privilege and duty to
control public announcements.

57:25.660 --> 57:28.282
I've drafted a press release
about the incident at the piazza,

57:28.475 --> 57:31.562
but any other statements
are specifically prohibited.

57:31.757 --> 57:36.421
For that, the cardinal has asked me
to remind you we have a chimney.

57:40.386 --> 57:42.100
Commander Richter,
the search for the device?

57:42.495 --> 57:46.915
Well, we've turned the power on and off
to about twenty percent of Vatican city

57:47.100 --> 57:49.290
- but nothing on the video yet.
- We're running out of options.

57:49.482 --> 57:51.305
How long would you need
to evacuate everyone?

57:51.472 --> 57:54.422
If I pull all my men from the
search for the bomb, thirty minutes.

57:55.733 --> 57:58.759
Mr. Langdon, you have been
right so far about the path.

57:58.936 --> 58:02.052
It's now 9:15. How quickly
can you find the next church?

58:02.241 --> 58:05.668
The lines of breath on the carving pointed
due east directly away from Vatican City.

58:05.840 --> 58:08.006
But there were five of them,
so there's room for error.

58:08.183 --> 58:12.406
About twenty churches intersect those lines.
None of them have names that invoke fire.

58:12.651 --> 58:15.432
So, the Bernini sculpture must
be inside one of them that does.

58:15.608 --> 58:17.607
I'm willing to get back
into the archives to find it.

58:17.768 --> 58:19.707
- Would you escort Mr Langdon?
- Yes, Father.

58:22.572 --> 58:25.187
Silvano's journals.
The killer's name could be in here.

58:25.945 --> 58:28.114
- May I stay?
- Please. Fine. Of course.

58:30.215 --> 58:31.225
Professor.

58:32.762 --> 58:35.292
Would it surprise you to
find those clothes suit you?

58:36.410 --> 58:38.533
It would surprise the hell out of me.

58:55.987 --> 58:58.530
The Vatican expressed its sympathy
with the families of the victim.

58:58.738 --> 59:01.882
A tourist from Düsseldorf,
whose death is confirmed.

59:02.077 --> 59:05.822
Vatican police have
arrested a suspect...

59:06.069 --> 59:09.132
The investigation is completed.

59:09.336 --> 59:15.999
Vatican will permit access to St. Peter's
again, with strict security measures.

59:16.187 --> 59:19.759
The Vatican did admit that, where there
are crowds, so often follows crime.

59:20.122 --> 59:22.206
We're trying now to get the
name of the tourist who was...

59:22.377 --> 59:24.196
But wait.

59:25.715 --> 59:27.682
We're getting word now of smoke.

59:27.975 --> 59:32.259
Smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney.
Apparently, there's been another vote.

59:32.462 --> 59:34.051
The smoke is black.

59:34.235 --> 59:36.562
Once again, the Cardinals have
failed to reach consensus,

59:36.750 --> 59:39.124
and the Catholic Church
remains without a leader.

59:47.884 --> 59:49.156
What are you looking for now?

59:50.449 --> 59:52.900
- Church assets.
- I beg your pardon?

59:53.710 --> 59:55.042
Artwork. It's valuable.

59:55.679 --> 59:58.092
Corporations tend to keep
track of their holdings.

59:58.297 --> 01:00:02.325
The Catholic church is not
a corporation. It's a beacon.

01:00:03.172 --> 01:00:06.032
A source of inspiration for one
billion lost and frightened souls.

01:00:06.245 --> 01:00:08.303
Sure, I get that. It's also a bank.

01:00:19.132 --> 01:00:21.733
Commander Olivetti said that I was
not to leave your side this time.

01:00:24.847 --> 01:00:26.441
It wasn't me. It was her.

01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:46.011
Power in zone 3 is disabled.

01:00:46.478 --> 01:00:48.028
No response on the screen.

01:00:48.313 --> 01:00:50.426
Power on zone 3 again
and continue with zone 4.

01:01:01.779 --> 01:01:02.977
What sort of signs?

01:01:03.638 --> 01:01:05.235
I'm sorry?

01:01:09.727 --> 01:01:13.377
If the Holy Father was given
an overdose of Tinzaparin,

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:15.954
what signs would his body bear?

01:01:17.769 --> 01:01:19.413
Bleeding of the oral mucosa.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.436
His tongue.

01:01:22.741 --> 01:01:26.056
Post-mortem, the blood congeals,
then turns the inside of the mouth black.

01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:29.928
Even after fourteen days?

01:01:30.766 --> 01:01:33.464
It wouldn't show up until at
least a week after his death.

01:01:38.599 --> 01:01:40.076
He was very important to me.

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:43.624
Yeah, I understand.

01:01:48.433 --> 01:01:50.589
Will you come with me, please?

01:01:58.697 --> 01:02:00.463
Signore, would you
organize a security team

01:02:00.464 --> 01:02:02.349
to escort Ms. Vetra and
myself down to the crypt?

01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:04.318
Yes, sir. We'll leave immediately.

01:02:22.942 --> 01:02:24.835
Do you smoke?

01:02:26.267 --> 01:02:27.879
A little bit.

01:02:28.195 --> 01:02:31.118
You better sit down
before you keel over.

01:02:36.925 --> 01:02:41.775
What does this say in Italian?
Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Right there.

01:02:44.347 --> 01:02:46.985
Moved at suggestion of the artist.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:51.729
Moved? To another church?
At the suggestion of Bernini?

01:02:51.765 --> 01:02:53.317
I don't know.

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:59.948
Here. Translate all of this for me,
and I'll buy you a pack of smokes.

01:02:59.955 --> 01:03:02.592
I'm looking for a reference of fire.

01:03:04.528 --> 01:03:07.535
- Seraphim, meaning "the fiery one".
- Right.

01:03:10.006 --> 01:03:13.921
His great golden spear. A point of fire.

01:03:15.332 --> 01:03:19.338
Then "woman left completely afire."

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:23.401
The ecstasy of Saint Theresa.
Saint Theresa on fire.

01:03:23.406 --> 01:03:26.055
So, this sculpture was
moved to this church?

01:03:27.706 --> 01:03:30.566
Why are they shuting down the system?
They know we're down here.

01:03:31.251 --> 01:03:34.216
If there's no power, there's no oxygen.

01:03:35.171 --> 01:03:37.783
- Can we get out?
- The door is electronic.

01:03:41.453 --> 01:03:43.207
Well, that's disappointing.

01:03:44.577 --> 01:03:47.571
- Where are we going?
- To see my father.

01:03:47.921 --> 01:03:49.402
I don't understand.

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:52.222
I was orphaned when I
was nine years of age.

01:03:52.387 --> 01:03:56.853
A bombing in Ulster, the UVF protesting
the visit of a Catholic Archbishop.

01:03:56.933 --> 01:04:01.177
The Archbishop felt responsible
and he adopted me the following day.

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.984
I was raised by him and by the Church.

01:04:04.554 --> 01:04:06.907
He was the wisest man I ever met.

01:04:07.368 --> 01:04:11.065
Even when I was young and stubborn,
I wanted to be ordained,

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.541
but I was brought up in Italy
so I also wanted to do my military service.

01:04:14.546 --> 01:04:16.478
I wanted to fight.

01:04:16.915 --> 01:04:19.905
He told me, "Learn to fly."

01:04:19.938 --> 01:04:23.807
So, I joined the Aeronautica Militari.
Flew helicopters.

01:04:23.817 --> 01:04:26.219
Bringing the wounded back to hospitals.

01:04:26.224 --> 01:04:29.314
- He was a great man.
- Your father died.

01:04:30.179 --> 01:04:31.857
Fourteen days ago.

01:04:32.749 --> 01:04:34.644
Headquarters, you hear me?

01:04:35.182 --> 01:04:37.912
The flow is completed.
Oxygen level is very low.

01:04:37.913 --> 01:04:41.415
- Answer, please. Anybody hear me?
- Did you get anything?

01:04:41.423 --> 01:04:45.104
No. The walls are lead lined.
There's no signal.

01:07:59.535 --> 01:08:00.540
This way.

01:08:08.446 --> 01:08:12.426
If the Holy Father was murdered,
the implications are profound.

01:08:12.445 --> 01:08:14.754
Vatican security is impenetrable.

01:08:14.761 --> 01:08:17.303
No one from the outside
could've got anywhere near him.

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:21.392
It was someone on the inside.
We can trust no one.

01:08:23.372 --> 01:08:27.318
On my screen, no response in zone 7.

01:08:27.357 --> 01:08:31.339
We rechon that the
battery will soon be empty

01:08:31.558 --> 01:08:33.821
and the device will explode
shortly before midnight.

01:08:55.451 --> 01:08:57.023
Holy Father...

01:08:57.962 --> 01:09:02.009
when I was young, you've told me the
voice in my heart was God's voice.

01:09:02.044 --> 01:09:05.466
You said I should follow
it no matter how painful.

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.834
Forgive me.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.169
Please, give me strength.

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:15.965
What I do, I do in the name
of everything you believed.

01:10:06.252 --> 01:10:08.087
God help us.

01:10:20.554 --> 01:10:23.321
Santa Maria della Vittoria.
Do you know it?

01:10:23.794 --> 01:10:26.207
- Yes, I do.
- It's the next church.

01:10:42.467 --> 01:10:44.321
I think someone just tried to kill me.

01:10:44.329 --> 01:10:46.517
Professor, I promise you,
we had no idea.

01:10:46.518 --> 01:10:47.729
- He knows I'm here?
- Yes.

01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:49.637
You heard me ask permission.
You gave me an escort.

01:10:49.642 --> 01:10:50.744
Yes, but we had no idea

01:10:50.745 --> 01:10:53.954
that portions of our white zones
were crosswired with that building.

01:10:54.948 --> 01:10:56.741
Commander Richter was
extending the search.

01:10:56.743 --> 01:10:58.606
If he had known the archives
were on that grid,

01:10:58.607 --> 01:10:59.965
he never would have killed the power.

01:11:01.027 --> 01:11:03.087
But there is the other possibility.

01:11:03.271 --> 01:11:06.172
Is it conceivable the Illuminati...

01:11:06.719 --> 01:11:09.203
have infiltrated the Swiss Guard?

01:11:11.846 --> 01:11:13.254
Perhaps.

01:11:23.392 --> 01:11:25.239
The journals. Where are they?

01:11:27.542 --> 01:11:29.867
Who took the journals from this desk?

01:11:39.992 --> 01:11:42.795
Signore, this is unacceptable.

01:11:43.492 --> 01:11:46.572
For a Camerlengo to enter the
chapel once conclave has begun.

01:11:46.579 --> 01:11:47.656
Forgive me.

01:11:47.657 --> 01:11:49.479
There's been a development.

01:12:00.037 --> 01:12:02.773
His Holiness Celestine was murdered!

01:12:02.774 --> 01:12:06.650
Is it so inconceivable
that it will happen again?

01:12:06.652 --> 01:12:09.553
Signori, please, a moment.
Please. Signori.

01:12:12.023 --> 01:12:14.467
Our church is at war.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.786
We are under attack from an old enemy.

01:12:19.145 --> 01:12:20.970
The Illuminati.

01:12:21.466 --> 01:12:23.986
They have struck us from within.

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:26.186
Murdering our Holy Father!

01:12:26.221 --> 01:12:30.748
And threatening us all with destruction
at the hands of their new God 'Science'.

01:12:30.862 --> 01:12:34.109
They call it retribution.
They think it justified...

01:12:34.144 --> 01:12:38.291
because of the Church's attacks on men of
science in the distant past and it's true.

01:12:38.999 --> 01:12:44.064
Since the days of Galileo, this church has
tried to slow the relentless march of progress.

01:12:44.099 --> 01:12:46.333
Sometimes with misguided means.

01:12:47.842 --> 01:12:49.934
But science and
religion are not enemies.

01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:56.220
There are simply some things that
science is just too young to understand.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:58.396
So the Church pleads, "Stop."

01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:00.191
"Slow down."

01:13:00.373 --> 01:13:01.721
"Think. Wait."

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.765
And, for this, they call us backwards.

01:13:04.884 --> 01:13:06.644
But who is more ignorant?

01:13:06.974 --> 01:13:08.978
The man who cannot define lightning...

01:13:09.341 --> 01:13:12.450
or the man who does not respect
its natural awesome power?

01:13:13.539 --> 01:13:15.685
The battle is well under way, signori.

01:13:16.419 --> 01:13:18.350
We must defend ourselves.

01:13:18.558 --> 01:13:21.127
But, what if this time, we fight
their stealth with openness?

01:13:21.302 --> 01:13:23.989
Combat their wicked
scheme with simple truth.

01:13:24.182 --> 01:13:27.133
And end this brutish
battle once and for all.

01:13:27.328 --> 01:13:30.142
If the outside world could
see this church as I do,

01:13:30.346 --> 01:13:32.241
looking beyond the
ritual of these walls,

01:13:32.438 --> 01:13:34.972
they would see a modern miracle.

01:13:35.182 --> 01:13:38.753
A brotherhood of
imperfect, simple souls...

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:41.900
who want nothing more than to be voices of compassion

01:13:41.901 --> 01:13:43.794
in a world spinning out of control.

01:13:46.049 --> 01:13:48.476
Signori, I ask..

01:13:49.711 --> 01:13:51.440
I pray...

01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:54.961
that you break this conclave.

01:13:55.273 --> 01:13:56.629
Open the doors,

01:13:57.779 --> 01:13:59.508
evacuate St. Peter's Square

01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:01.804
and tell the world the truth.

01:14:37.332 --> 01:14:38.936
Get him down.

01:14:50.617 --> 01:14:53.089
There. There, that
chain. On that pulley.

01:14:53.309 --> 01:14:54.708
This bench. Get this pew off
here and make it a ladder.

01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:18.129
Vatican Police.

01:17:20.164 --> 01:17:22.895
My son...

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:26.371
God answers all prayers, but...

01:17:27.173 --> 01:17:29.564
sometimes His answer is no.

01:17:30.737 --> 01:17:33.425
The College will not break conclave.

01:17:34.562 --> 01:17:38.563
May I suggest...
you direct your energies

01:17:38.564 --> 01:17:42.151
to helping the Swiss Guard
find this explosive device.

01:17:42.156 --> 01:17:43.828
If it exists.

01:17:45.008 --> 01:17:47.733
And leave Church leadership...

01:17:49.459 --> 01:17:51.282
to its leaders.

01:18:03.362 --> 01:18:04.592
Eminence.

01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:09.131
There is a growing fear

01:18:09.823 --> 01:18:11.980
that without the four Preferiti

01:18:11.985 --> 01:18:15.207
it defers much authority
for any candidate.

01:18:15.208 --> 01:18:16.964
It will not be possible,

01:18:17.279 --> 01:18:19.450
- unless...
- Speak plainly.

01:18:20.718 --> 01:18:24.449
It is the recommendation of many
that you asked to be removed...

01:18:24.455 --> 01:18:26.697
from your post as Great Elector.

01:18:26.972 --> 01:18:33.384
Thereby making yourself eligible
to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.

01:18:34.692 --> 01:18:37.952
Well, if it is God's will.

01:18:45.527 --> 01:18:47.525
May His will be done.

01:19:00.322 --> 01:19:02.243
Here! I hear someone.

01:19:04.523 --> 01:19:06.155
Remove the lid.

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:09.965
Come on.

01:19:14.328 --> 01:19:15.919
Signore, are you okay?

01:19:24.223 --> 01:19:26.146
I know he is there.

01:19:26.158 --> 01:19:29.201
Madam, it is necessary
that you remain quiet.

01:19:29.217 --> 01:19:32.991
Don't tell me that I should remain calm.
I want to know what he will do.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.389
Commander, here's Ms. Vetra.

01:19:40.867 --> 01:19:43.412
Those journals are private property.
I demand that you return them to me.

01:19:43.414 --> 01:19:46.551
They're material evidence
in a Vatican investigation.

01:19:48.852 --> 01:19:49.998
I am an Italian citizen.

01:19:49.999 --> 01:19:52.767
My rights do not end just
because I crossed the other side.

01:19:52.768 --> 01:19:55.994
This is not Italy.
It's not even Rome. It's the Vatican.

01:19:56.019 --> 01:19:58.055
A country with its own laws.

01:19:58.059 --> 01:20:01.502
And when those journals passed the
border, they became my property.

01:20:01.507 --> 01:20:03.231
I will give them back to you

01:20:03.657 --> 01:20:06.688
when I've decided they contain
nothing of value to the investigation.

01:20:06.691 --> 01:20:09.027
Do you have something to
hide, Commandante Richter?

01:20:11.952 --> 01:20:13.890
Do you, Dr. Vetra?

01:20:35.516 --> 01:20:37.870
If it were up to me,
it wouldn't be this way.

01:20:39.518 --> 01:20:42.074
It's a sin to kill with pain.

01:20:43.324 --> 01:20:45.474
It's a sin to kill
without reason, Father.

01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:53.125
They made me a sinner.

01:21:12.877 --> 01:21:14.549
Saint Theresa on fire.

01:21:17.944 --> 01:21:18.925
Professor Langdon?

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:22.695
- What direction is that?
- West, I think.

01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:24.705
"Across Rome the mystic
elements unfold."

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:31.629
Piazza Barba Rini is here.
Saint Theresa is here.

01:21:32.544 --> 01:21:34.661
Where is the Santa Maria del Popolo,
the first altar of science?

01:21:34.869 --> 01:21:36.085
- Santa Maria del Popolo?
- Yes.

01:21:38.302 --> 01:21:39.464
Thank you.

01:21:40.339 --> 01:21:41.735
St. Peter's is here.

01:21:42.601 --> 01:21:44.074
We are here.

01:21:46.143 --> 01:21:47.748
A church with water.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.001
Wait. Wait, wait.

01:21:51.817 --> 01:21:53.195
Across Rome.

01:21:54.831 --> 01:21:57.138
The poem must mean it's
literally across Rome.

01:21:57.865 --> 01:21:58.414
Professor Langdon.

01:21:58.514 --> 01:22:01.177
Commander Richter has ordered me to
escort you to the Vatican immediately.

01:22:01.409 --> 01:22:05.969
Piazza Navona. Earth. Air. Fire. Water.

01:22:06.403 --> 01:22:08.142
"A-Cross" Rome.

01:22:08.695 --> 01:22:10.252
Bernini's Four Rivers.

01:22:11.891 --> 01:22:14.841
Professor Langdon, the Vatican insists
that I have to take you back immediately.

01:22:15.058 --> 01:22:17.301
The Vatican is about to see its
fourth cardinal murdered tonight.

01:22:17.505 --> 01:22:18.611
Now, look.

01:22:19.414 --> 01:22:22.239
You can do as they say and
force me back to the Vatican,

01:22:22.552 --> 01:22:24.833
where we can all mourn
his death together.

01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:27.097
Or you can show me how real cops act

01:22:27.327 --> 01:22:30.620
and take me to Piazza Navona,
where we still might be able to stop it.

01:22:34.336 --> 01:22:36.293
Oh. By all means, let's talk it over.

01:22:37.532 --> 01:22:39.225
In fourteen minutes,
he's going to be dead.

01:22:45.039 --> 01:22:46.578
Okay. This way, Professor.

01:22:55.288 --> 01:22:56.525
Yes, Padre?

01:22:56.935 --> 01:22:59.718
At 11:15, if the church
is still in peril,

01:23:00.856 --> 01:23:02.957
give the order to
evacuate the cardinals.

01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:05.491
But with dignity.

01:23:06.305 --> 01:23:09.207
Let them walk out into St. Peter's
Square with their heads held high.

01:23:10.171 --> 01:23:12.329
We don't want the last
image of this church to be

01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:14.400
of frightened old men
sneaking out the back door.

01:23:31.304 --> 01:23:32.634
"Where the angels guide thee..."

01:23:38.459 --> 01:23:40.252
There it is. There it is.

01:23:40.312 --> 01:23:42.880
Professor, I know this fountain.
There is no angel.

01:23:43.086 --> 01:23:45.346
The dove. The angel of peace.

01:23:45.927 --> 01:23:47.520
And it's looking in what direction?

01:23:48.277 --> 01:23:49.519
Uh... east, I think.

01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:03.613
Professor, just wait here. Stay put.

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.339
Good evening. Can you help me?

01:24:42.346 --> 01:24:44.166
I need a doctor.

01:24:59.856 --> 01:25:01.034
Come here.

01:25:04.128 --> 01:25:05.225
Calm down. Don't shoot.

01:25:42.164 --> 01:25:44.124
Hey!

01:25:57.835 --> 01:25:59.984
Help! Somebody help!

01:26:37.875 --> 01:26:39.181
Help! Somebody!

01:27:50.738 --> 01:27:51.723
Cardinal Baja.

01:27:52.721 --> 01:27:53.652
Cardinal Baja.

01:27:54.318 --> 01:27:55.344
Si?

01:27:55.526 --> 01:27:57.172
Where was he hiding you?

01:27:58.170 --> 01:27:59.939
The Church of Illumination.
Where is it?

01:28:01.484 --> 01:28:03.742
Castel Sant'Angelo.

01:28:05.294 --> 01:28:07.095
Castle of the Angel.

01:28:28.543 --> 01:28:30.718
Sir, there's news about Cardinal Baja.

01:28:31.955 --> 01:28:34.816
The cardinal told Langdon he was
being held in Castel Sant'Angelo.

01:28:35.594 --> 01:28:37.644
If Langdon's right,
that's where the bomb is.

01:28:38.421 --> 01:28:40.872
- Send everyone we can spare.
- And you?

01:28:41.422 --> 01:28:42.476
I'm staying here.

01:28:55.647 --> 01:28:56.701
Vittoria.

01:28:58.065 --> 01:28:59.890
- You're all right?
- I'm all right, yes. What about you?

01:28:59.892 --> 01:29:01.668
I just heard about
Olivetti on the radio.

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:02.641
I'm all right. I'm okay.

01:29:08.438 --> 01:29:10.579
Robert, we can't trust Richter.

01:29:10.583 --> 01:29:11.735
He took Silvano's journals.

01:29:11.736 --> 01:29:14.209
There must be something in
there he doesn't want us to see.

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:16.348
The head of the Swiss Guard.

01:29:17.763 --> 01:29:20.472
From the Castel Sant'Angelo.
It's close enough so the wireless signal

01:29:20.473 --> 01:29:22.214
from that camera
could still reach the Vatican.

01:29:23.966 --> 01:29:26.854
The Church of Illumination
is somewhere here

01:29:27.386 --> 01:29:29.402
and your canister is inside it.

01:29:49.164 --> 01:29:50.605
Come with me.

01:29:54.649 --> 01:29:57.820
For 400 years, the Illuminati
met right under the Church's nose.

01:29:57.825 --> 01:30:00.981
The Vatican used this as a hideout
and as a prison for their enemies.

01:30:01.602 --> 01:30:05.551
If the explosion happens here, would
the blast radius take out the Vatican?

01:30:05.723 --> 01:30:08.315
And part of Rome along with it.

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:27.298
They're pointing to it. The angels.

01:30:27.382 --> 01:30:29.317
The container must be down there.
Come on!

01:31:15.633 --> 01:31:18.735
- Where are they going?
- Back to search the other castle.

01:31:19.085 --> 01:31:20.781
No, no. It has to be here!

01:31:25.285 --> 01:31:26.985
Robert, it's a dead end.

01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:28.622
No, it's not.

01:31:29.044 --> 01:31:31.146
See if you can find a flashlight.

01:31:47.787 --> 01:31:50.142
All of these stones
are rectangular granite.

01:31:50.324 --> 01:31:52.594
Except right here. What is this?

01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:58.462
It's a pentagram.

01:31:58.623 --> 01:31:59.860
An eye...

01:32:00.411 --> 01:32:01.842
that leads to...

01:32:01.846 --> 01:32:03.002
Nowhere.

01:32:12.369 --> 01:32:13.369
Robert?

01:32:15.206 --> 01:32:18.274
These walls overlap and
there's a passageway in here.

01:32:18.342 --> 01:32:19.723
Here. Let me have the flashlight.

01:32:42.207 --> 01:32:45.249
It's a passageway that
leads to the Vatican.

01:32:45.284 --> 01:32:47.748
An ancient escape route.

01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:51.454
Oh, God.

01:32:53.363 --> 01:32:54.451
Here.

01:32:57.031 --> 01:32:58.751
Look.

01:33:16.852 --> 01:33:20.252
(Final Payment in VW at Via Giulia)
(Key taped to driver side front wheel)

01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:31.566
Get on the radio.

01:33:31.567 --> 01:33:34.469
Get the word out.
Conclave remains sealed.

01:33:34.473 --> 01:33:36.432
The Camerlengo gave the
order for evacuation at--

01:33:36.593 --> 01:33:38.018
I'm counter-manning it.

01:33:43.802 --> 01:33:45.791
This is it. This is their church.

01:33:48.118 --> 01:33:50.799
The canister should be
lit by artificial light.

01:34:13.843 --> 01:34:15.016
It's not here, Robert.

01:34:15.066 --> 01:34:17.361
"The shining star at the end of the path."
It has to be.

01:34:17.769 --> 01:34:19.520
It's not here.

01:34:19.702 --> 01:34:21.857
What's the poem say?
- Nothing.

01:34:21.908 --> 01:34:24.865
Nothing. It's all over.
There was just four lines,

01:34:24.957 --> 01:34:27.000
each one describing...

01:34:35.947 --> 01:34:37.695
There's a fifth brand.

01:34:37.745 --> 01:34:39.776
It's not an ambigram.
It's just two crossed keys.

01:34:40.177 --> 01:34:42.621
- The symbol for the Vatican.
- No.

01:34:43.628 --> 01:34:46.813
No, the papacy.
They intend to kill him.

01:34:46.848 --> 01:34:49.097
Before they destroy the Vatican,

01:34:49.098 --> 01:34:51.004
they're going to brand
and kill the pope himself.

01:34:51.054 --> 01:34:51.754
There is no pope.

01:34:51.873 --> 01:34:53.629
"Tempo Sede Vacante."

01:34:54.164 --> 01:34:55.865
The Camerlengo.

01:34:57.505 --> 01:34:59.764
- We have to warn him.
- Take a step back, please.

01:35:01.291 --> 01:35:03.513
Take your cell phone from your pocket.

01:35:06.663 --> 01:35:08.404
Throw it in the fire.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.625
Murderer.

01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:22.584
You know, when they call me,

01:35:23.234 --> 01:35:24.342
and they all call me,

01:35:24.377 --> 01:35:25.956
it is so important to them

01:35:25.963 --> 01:35:29.509
that I know that what they
ask is the Lord's will.

01:35:29.514 --> 01:35:32.620
Or Allah's. Or Yahweh's.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.859
And I suppose they're right.

01:35:40.303 --> 01:35:44.344
Because if he was not vengeful,
I would not exist, now, would I?

01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:47.099
I've had several chances
to eliminate you tonight.

01:35:47.106 --> 01:35:49.398
You're still alive
because you have no weapon.

01:35:49.399 --> 01:35:50.974
And they didn't ask me to kill you.

01:35:50.979 --> 01:35:54.128
But if you pursue me,
it is another matter.

01:36:01.063 --> 01:36:02.278
Be careful.

01:36:02.446 --> 01:36:04.425
These are men of God.

01:36:16.887 --> 01:36:18.084
The Camerlengo.

01:36:26.106 --> 01:36:28.529
Have you come to make me a martyr?

01:36:36.448 --> 01:36:37.462
Here. Here.

01:38:01.133 --> 01:38:03.156
- I need to see the Camerlengo.
- He is not available.

01:38:03.158 --> 01:38:05.690
- I demand to see the Camerlengo!
- He is not available.

01:38:07.377 --> 01:38:08.759
We'll see about that.

01:38:18.007 --> 01:38:20.619
Oh. It's a chiusa chiave.
It's a one way portal.

01:38:20.659 --> 01:38:22.781
The only entrance is on the other side.

01:38:23.334 --> 01:38:25.451
No. Hey! Help!

01:38:33.530 --> 01:38:35.929
This is Robert Langdon and
Dr. Vetra. Open the door.

01:38:48.806 --> 01:38:50.670
The Camerlengo is in danger.

01:39:03.858 --> 01:39:06.414
He's the one. He's got a gun.

01:39:09.882 --> 01:39:12.104
- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.

01:39:12.673 --> 01:39:13.373
Illuminatus!

01:39:13.507 --> 01:39:14.906
You bastard!

01:39:22.744 --> 01:39:23.709
Padre?

01:39:23.784 --> 01:39:27.237
Order the evacuation.
We only have nineteen minutes.

01:39:30.978 --> 01:39:32.608
Here. He's...

01:39:32.693 --> 01:39:34.994
And get the helicopter for
the older cardinals, right?

01:39:34.995 --> 01:39:35.695
Yes, sir.

01:39:48.913 --> 01:39:49.926
Robert?

01:39:50.089 --> 01:39:52.848
The brand, the symbol.
Could it have another meaning?

01:39:59.184 --> 01:40:02.382
Crossed keys,
but those were upside down.

01:40:02.417 --> 01:40:03.982
St. Peter.

01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:06.671
The first pope...

01:40:07.774 --> 01:40:10.643
...was crucified upside down.
- On Vatican Hill.

01:40:10.649 --> 01:40:13.512
- A few hundred feet below us.
- Necropolis. City of the dead.

01:40:13.514 --> 01:40:16.158
"Upon this rock, I
will build my church."

01:40:16.162 --> 01:40:18.688
"Or bring it down upon itself."

01:40:19.464 --> 01:40:22.682
The bomb. It's in St. Peter's tomb.

01:40:37.096 --> 01:40:38.635
The grid is still cycling.

01:40:38.636 --> 01:40:40.541
The power to this section must be down.

01:41:26.208 --> 01:41:29.012
It must be here. It must be.

01:41:39.806 --> 01:41:40.977
Don't touch it.

01:41:42.482 --> 01:41:44.032
We have seven minutes.

01:41:49.942 --> 01:41:52.139
Robert, hold this.

01:42:31.443 --> 01:42:33.893
It's cold down here, isn't it?

01:42:33.897 --> 01:42:35.256
What's wrong?

01:42:35.343 --> 01:42:37.879
Cold decreases battery life.

01:42:39.877 --> 01:42:43.202
- We may have less than five minutes.
- So?

01:42:43.237 --> 01:42:46.134
If I pull the power with
less than five minutes...

01:42:46.139 --> 01:42:49.070
the residual charge
won't hold suspension.

01:42:50.185 --> 01:42:52.098
We should leave it here
and get clear if we can.

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:53.269
At least down here the damage--

01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:54.602
No!

01:42:56.065 --> 01:42:57.532
- No. Wait!
- Father!

01:43:00.053 --> 01:43:02.086
We are live here at
St. Peter's Square...

01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:05.382
where, despite a bomb threat,
and an orderly evacuation,

01:43:05.389 --> 01:43:08.074
the crowd is actually growing in size.

01:43:08.079 --> 01:43:10.875
As we await an official announcement
from the Vatican spokesman

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.965
as to the exact nature of the threat

01:43:12.969 --> 01:43:15.944
and whether or not they are
treating it as a credible danger...

01:43:24.098 --> 01:43:25.002
This way!

01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:55.383
He's got a bomb with him.

01:43:56.621 --> 01:43:57.682
A bomb?

01:44:02.947 --> 01:44:05.504
Roberto, this is an emergency.
I'll take her up alone.

01:44:10.219 --> 01:44:12.269
He's got clearance.

01:44:35.814 --> 01:44:38.376
Oh, my God.

01:46:34.912 --> 01:46:36.553
Get down!

01:49:21.828 --> 01:49:23.152
Cardinal Strauss?

01:49:23.952 --> 01:49:27.527
It was the Camerlengo.
He has saved us all.

01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.248
He has saved the Church
and he's still alive.

01:49:32.606 --> 01:49:34.617
Praise God. Praise God.

01:49:39.889 --> 01:49:41.130
He is alive.

01:49:41.642 --> 01:49:44.378
He sacrificed himself for all of us.

01:50:11.566 --> 01:50:14.341
You know the worst thing
we thought would happen

01:50:15.517 --> 01:50:18.831
was that our work would fall into
the hands of the energy companies.

01:50:21.573 --> 01:50:23.300
We thought we could change the world.

01:50:24.178 --> 01:50:27.964
- So naive.
- No, not naive.

01:50:29.074 --> 01:50:30.545
Innocent, maybe.

01:50:31.114 --> 01:50:33.252
But it's not a crime.

01:50:34.702 --> 01:50:36.090
I'm not so sure.

01:50:38.148 --> 01:50:39.906
Go back to work.

01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:42.685
Change the world.

01:51:02.779 --> 01:51:08.382
A gift, uh, you understand?
Let's say for Catholics everywhere.

01:51:08.595 --> 01:51:11.255
The Carmelengo's age
shouldn't influence the decision.

01:51:11.434 --> 01:51:14.191
Signori, you are no doubt
aware that by Holy Law

01:51:14.192 --> 01:51:17.004
the man is inelligible
for election to the papacy.

01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:19.327
He's not a cardinal.
He's a priest.

01:51:19.328 --> 01:51:20.597
He's of insufficient age.

01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:23.678
Or maybe there's a way we
could consider the possibility.

01:51:23.871 --> 01:51:27.839
I am sorry. The protocols of conclave
are not subject to modification.

01:51:28.008 --> 01:51:30.826
I will not call a ballot on this matter.

01:51:31.032 --> 01:51:33.608
But, signore, you
would not hold a ballot.

01:51:33.811 --> 01:51:37.184
Surely, you remember? You gave
up your post as Great Elector.

01:51:37.921 --> 01:51:40.064
They are singing at St. Peter's Square.

01:51:40.252 --> 01:51:42.888
Now, what happened here
tonight transcends our laws.

01:51:43.108 --> 01:51:47.344
Has it? Is it God's will that
we give ourselves over to frenzy?

01:51:47.448 --> 01:51:48.879
Discard the rules of the Church?

01:51:48.919 --> 01:51:51.119
Perhaps we need not discard them.

01:51:52.145 --> 01:51:57.747
Signori, I am thinking now of Romano
Pontifici Eligendo numero 60...

01:51:57.987 --> 01:52:00.881
- Acclamation by Adoration.
- Exactly, signore. Exactly.

01:52:01.150 --> 01:52:03.605
Yes. If the Holy Spirit
speaks through us,

01:52:04.126 --> 01:52:06.026
and we call a man's name out loud...

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:08.972
That is election by adoration.

01:52:09.402 --> 01:52:11.229
- Yes.
- He's God's choice.

01:52:11.509 --> 01:52:17.248
Yes. And the candidate need only be
an ordained member of the clergy,

01:52:17.252 --> 01:52:21.338
present in the Sistine Chapel
at the moment of his election.

01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:55.375
- Signor Camerlengo?
- Yes?

01:52:55.376 --> 01:52:58.857
The cardinals ask you to join them
in conclave as soon as possible.

01:52:58.942 --> 01:53:01.434
- Me?
- Yes, Padre.

01:53:24.525 --> 01:53:25.947
What are you doing?

01:53:25.997 --> 01:53:28.342
Silvano's journals. I want them back.

01:53:52.572 --> 01:53:54.045
Richter said...

01:53:55.366 --> 01:53:57.700
His Holiness suffered from seizures

01:53:57.705 --> 01:54:00.212
and steps were taken...

01:54:00.421 --> 01:54:02.319
for safety.

01:54:06.324 --> 01:54:08.869
He made sure he was watched, he said.

01:54:10.952 --> 01:54:13.895
What if he were trying
to give me this key?

01:54:15.059 --> 01:54:17.026
That's the Papal office.

01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:19.342
If the Pope was worried about seizures,

01:54:19.343 --> 01:54:22.286
he must've had Richter install
cameras without telling anyone.

01:54:22.321 --> 01:54:25.123
To keep an eye on him for his safety.

01:54:26.886 --> 01:54:28.861
Maybe it records.

01:54:38.927 --> 01:54:43.572
- I read the journals, Patrick.
- The scientist kept journals. So?

01:54:43.573 --> 01:54:46.939
- You figure prominently in them.
- Really?

01:54:46.941 --> 01:54:51.541
The Devoli wasn't just a physicist.
He was also a Catholic priest.

01:54:52.239 --> 01:54:56.405
As such, he was deeply conflicted
about the implications of his work

01:54:56.406 --> 01:54:58.426
and in need of spiritual guidance.

01:54:58.434 --> 01:55:00.198
Like Galileo.

01:55:01.039 --> 01:55:02.845
About a month ago,

01:55:02.849 --> 01:55:05.180
he requested an
audience with the Pope.

01:55:05.181 --> 01:55:06.113
But you know that,

01:55:06.305 --> 01:55:09.586
cause you granted the audience and
you were also present during it.

01:55:09.588 --> 01:55:12.766
The 'God Particle'. To actually
claim an act of creation.

01:55:12.767 --> 01:55:17.154
- The blasphemy. The arrogance.
- The Holy Father didn't see it like that.

01:55:17.259 --> 01:55:19.359
He urged him to go public.

01:55:19.364 --> 01:55:22.071
His Holiness thought that
the discovery could actually

01:55:22.172 --> 01:55:25.408
scientifically prove the
existence of a divine power.

01:55:25.411 --> 01:55:28.614
And begin to bridge the gap
between science and religion.

01:55:28.618 --> 01:55:31.220
His work was not religious.
It was sacrilegious.

01:55:31.222 --> 01:55:32.034
But you...

01:55:32.924 --> 01:55:36.664
You saw the pope's position
as a softening of church law.

01:55:36.669 --> 01:55:40.484
As an old man's weakness.
Your father's weakness.

01:55:40.519 --> 01:55:42.245
You murdered the Vicar of Christ.

01:55:42.246 --> 01:55:44.337
He raised me to
protect this Church,

01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:45.923
even from within.

01:55:47.667 --> 01:55:52.250
Then you conjured up an old enemy
from the past. The Illuminati.

01:55:52.285 --> 01:55:54.786
You found the ancient brands
in the papal vaults

01:55:54.787 --> 01:55:57.325
and put them to use
to spread fear!

01:55:57.326 --> 01:55:59.792
The Cardinals are men of belief.

01:55:59.829 --> 01:56:03.815
Right now, their belief
in evil is uniting them.

01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:06.815
The entire Catholic world
will be united by this attack.

01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:08.402
There is no attack.

01:56:09.362 --> 01:56:12.588
You're trying to convince the
Cardinals they're in a war,

01:56:12.593 --> 01:56:14.438
so they will choose a
warrior to lead them.

01:56:14.442 --> 01:56:15.876
We are at war.

01:56:15.878 --> 01:56:17.915
We're weak when we should be strong.

01:56:17.919 --> 01:56:21.814
If science is allowed to
claim the power of creation,

01:56:21.828 --> 01:56:23.586
what is left for God?

01:56:23.621 --> 01:56:25.545
It didn't work, Patrick.

01:56:26.233 --> 01:56:29.219
- It isn't finished.
- Oh yes, it's finished.

01:56:31.491 --> 01:56:32.882
It's finished.

01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:36.945
I've shown the journals
to Father Simeon.

01:56:36.951 --> 01:56:39.131
The moment the doors
to the Conclave open,

01:56:39.137 --> 01:56:41.292
he will tell the Cardinals
what you've done.

01:56:42.181 --> 01:56:44.391
I was planning on doing this alone.

01:56:47.666 --> 01:56:48.850
Put it down.

01:56:51.865 --> 01:56:53.892
But, perhaps,
it's better that you're here.

01:56:53.939 --> 01:56:55.320
Put it down.

01:56:57.219 --> 01:56:58.956
Put it away.

01:57:10.024 --> 01:57:13.620
Help. He's the one.
He's got a gun.

01:57:17.264 --> 01:57:19.696
- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.

01:57:20.053 --> 01:57:20.815
Illuminatus!

01:57:20.821 --> 01:57:21.967
You bastard!

01:57:26.046 --> 01:57:27.153
Padre.

01:57:37.055 --> 01:57:40.223
And get the helicopter for
the older cardinals, right?

01:58:29.671 --> 01:58:32.214
I've been summoned by
the College of Cardinals.

01:59:42.237 --> 01:59:43.556
Gently.

01:59:43.864 --> 01:59:45.238
But within our walls.

01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:59.823
He's on your side.

02:00:46.153 --> 02:00:50.061
Father, into thy hands
I commend my spirit.

02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:42.550
Church sources now confirm that
Carmelengo, Father Patrick McKenna,

02:01:42.551 --> 02:01:46.600
has died of internal injuries
sustained in his heroic fall...

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:51.878
The Catholic church thanks
Camerlengo for his selfless act

02:01:51.879 --> 02:01:54.360
and demands his
immediate canonization.

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:57.324
The Vatican has also confirmed
the deaths of three Cardinals

02:01:57.325 --> 02:01:59.451
and the fire in the
Santa Maria della Vittoria.

02:01:59.546 --> 02:02:03.821
As we await the appearance of the new
Holy Father Cardinal Baggia of Italy,

02:02:03.950 --> 02:02:05.525
one of the four original Preferiti,

02:02:06.033 --> 02:02:08.174
who, despite terrorist
attempts at disruption

02:02:08.214 --> 02:02:09.759
seems to have been selected

02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:13.822
in one of the swiftest and smoothest
conclaves in modern church history.

02:02:20.916 --> 02:02:22.669
Professor Langdon? Please.

02:02:38.403 --> 02:02:41.859
A token of thanks from His Holiness

02:02:42.361 --> 02:02:44.599
and from his new Camerlengo.

02:02:46.073 --> 02:02:48.828
We are grateful you saved his life.

02:02:48.937 --> 02:02:52.465
And it's our understanding
that you require this text

02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:54.965
to complete your scholary work.

02:02:56.197 --> 02:03:00.998
We ask only that in your
last grand testament

02:03:01.067 --> 02:03:03.861
you ensure it finds its way home.

02:03:06.274 --> 02:03:07.623
Of course.

02:03:07.841 --> 02:03:09.811
And when you write of us,

02:03:09.934 --> 02:03:12.583
and you will write of us,

02:03:12.832 --> 02:03:14.776
may I ask one thing?

02:03:15.273 --> 02:03:16.996
Do so gently.

02:03:19.048 --> 02:03:20.485
I'll try.

02:03:20.781 --> 02:03:22.485
Religion is flawed,

02:03:23.158 --> 02:03:26.063
but only because man is flawed.

02:03:26.067 --> 02:03:28.681
All men, including this one.

02:03:43.225 --> 02:03:45.177
He chose the name Luke.

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:50.862
There's been many Marks and Johns.

02:03:51.967 --> 02:03:53.843
Never a Luke.

02:03:54.208 --> 02:03:56.337
It said he was a doctor.

02:03:56.781 --> 02:04:00.301
It's quite a message.
Science and faith, all in one.

02:04:01.206 --> 02:04:03.273
The world is in need of both.

02:04:04.983 --> 02:04:07.126
You'll counsel him wisely.

02:04:07.981 --> 02:04:10.774
I'm an old man.
I'll counsel him briefly.

02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:18.466
Mr. Langdon.

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:28.210
Thanks be to God for sending
someone to protect this church.

02:04:32.141 --> 02:04:35.483
I don't believe He sent me, Father.

02:04:35.544 --> 02:04:37.104
Oh, my son.

02:04:37.566 --> 02:04:39.485
Of course He did.

02:05:22.386 --> 02:05:27.386
subtitle made by rakib00, atheeshkr, lockjaw
and rogard. Nice teamwork, guys.
