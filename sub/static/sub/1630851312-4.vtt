WEBVTT

00:06.339 --> 00:07.507
I gotta say I'm pretty excited

00:07.574 --> 00:10.143
about Gemma and Dave
having a baby.

00:10.210 --> 00:12.412
Friends' babies are like
rental cars.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.614
You treat it like it's yours
until the gas light come on,

00:14.681 --> 00:17.417
and then you take it back.

00:17.484 --> 00:20.387
Yeah. And since we're
not grandparents,

00:20.453 --> 00:24.023
guess we have to lavish love
on other people's babies.

00:24.090 --> 00:26.726
Hey, Ma, can you, uh,

00:26.793 --> 00:28.395
hold the guilt
and pass the creamer?

00:30.630 --> 00:35.468
Alexa, add Baby No Cry mobile
to my shopping list, please.

00:35.535 --> 00:40.573
ALEXA:
I've added Baby No Cry mobile
to your shopping list.

00:40.640 --> 00:44.110
Well, Uncle Calvin is
sending over

00:44.177 --> 00:46.079
the perfect baby present.

00:46.146 --> 00:48.715
As you both know, I have a gift
for givin' gifts.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.284
Really?

00:51.351 --> 00:53.520
What about the hockey equipment
you got me when I was 12?

00:53.586 --> 00:58.124
I was trying to make you
the Tiger Woods of hockey.

00:58.191 --> 01:00.627
But 14 little stitches
and you quit.

01:01.861 --> 01:02.962
And if you think that's bad,

01:03.029 --> 01:06.299
he tried to give me that hockey
equipment for my birthday.

01:06.366 --> 01:08.268
Okay.

01:08.334 --> 01:11.471
So I guess nobody in this house
wants a gold medal.

01:11.538 --> 01:13.540
Hello, family.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.275
How y'all doing?

01:15.341 --> 01:16.176
Me, you ask?

01:16.242 --> 01:18.511
I am doing great.
I have a date tonight

01:18.578 --> 01:21.147
with a verified model
from Instagram.

01:21.214 --> 01:23.216
(laughs)

01:27.654 --> 01:29.823
What are y'all staring at?

01:29.889 --> 01:32.859
No, I'm just trying
to figure out

01:32.926 --> 01:34.127
who your friend is.

01:34.194 --> 01:37.163
My what?

01:37.230 --> 01:38.765
That little dude
that's on your face.

01:41.534 --> 01:43.436
No, no, no, no, Dad,
stay back.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.271
I've seen this movie before.

01:45.338 --> 01:46.706
That thing is gonna
bust out of his face

01:46.773 --> 01:49.108
and take over the world.

01:49.175 --> 01:52.178
Y'all are not funny, okay.
This is just a little pimple.

01:52.245 --> 01:54.247
Look, don't hate
because I have a date.

01:54.314 --> 01:57.116
Well, I hope you got
a table for three.

01:58.384 --> 02:01.254
It is not that noticeable.
Is it?

02:01.321 --> 02:04.691
It look like you got
another nose, man.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.426
Stop exaggerating, Marty.

02:06.493 --> 02:09.796
Damn, that thing is as big
as one of these muffins.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.466
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:13.533 --> 02:14.567
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

02:28.648 --> 02:29.916
How you feeling?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.851
Fine.

02:34.254 --> 02:35.421
Are you just saying
you're fine

02:35.488 --> 02:36.556
because you want me
to be fine?

02:36.623 --> 02:38.658
Because it's-it's...

02:38.725 --> 02:40.627
It's-it's totally okay
if you're not fine.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.862
Dave, I'm the same fine I was

02:42.929 --> 02:44.764
when you asked me
at the doctor's office,

02:44.831 --> 02:47.300
and in the car,
and on the porch.

02:49.369 --> 02:52.405
Sorry. I'm just...

02:52.472 --> 02:54.574
I'm worried about you.

02:56.376 --> 02:57.810
I don't know how
we're gonna tell people

02:57.877 --> 02:58.978
that we lost the baby.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.617
It was just supposed to be
a ten-week routine checkup.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.854
Yeah. Everything was
moving along nice and happy,

03:07.921 --> 03:09.556
and then all of a sudden,
life gives you

03:09.622 --> 03:12.025
a swift kick in the puckus.

03:15.895 --> 03:19.699
I think you meant "tuckus."

03:19.766 --> 03:21.868
But, you know,
puckus works, too.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.706
You know, my mom will say
this was God's will.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.642
Your mother was
banned from church

03:29.709 --> 03:32.545
for skinny-dipping
in the baptismal pool.

03:36.015 --> 03:39.319
I was just so shocked
when there wasn't a heartbeat.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.921
Apparently this is
really common.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.857
I guess sometimes
it's just not meant to be.

03:45.992 --> 03:49.596
Yeah, and... I know, but...

03:49.662 --> 03:51.598
this is also one of

03:51.664 --> 03:53.600
the hardest things
we'll ever have to deal with.

03:53.666 --> 03:56.369
I know,
but we'll get through it

03:56.436 --> 04:00.740
if we keep busy
and we stay strong.

04:00.807 --> 04:01.941
I know what we can do.

04:02.008 --> 04:04.277
Let's repaint
the living room.

04:04.344 --> 04:07.880
We'll pick a color that's
bright and cheerful.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.484
Do you really think that
that's the best way

04:11.551 --> 04:12.752
for us to approach this?

04:12.819 --> 04:15.555
Yes. It'll help us set

04:15.622 --> 04:18.958
a positive example for Grover
on how to handle grief.

04:19.025 --> 04:23.329
Okay. All right, um...

04:23.396 --> 04:24.797
Great.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.466
Okay, I'm gonna, uh,

04:26.532 --> 04:28.735
I'm gonna go buy some paint.
What color should I get?

04:28.801 --> 04:31.471
Pick any color, as long as it
comes with a bottle of wine.

04:33.373 --> 04:34.941
Hey, Devona.

04:33.373 --> 04:34.941
Hey.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.776
I'm making
an Alavay Makeup delivery.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.311
Got some goodies
your mother ordered.

04:38.378 --> 04:39.312
Oh, cool. She's home.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.747
Stop!

04:42.715 --> 04:44.984
She can wait.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.687
I see we have a breaking
news story on your face.

04:47.754 --> 04:50.456
I've got a product

04:50.523 --> 04:52.892
that will cover
that right up.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.994
Sorry, Devona, but I am not

04:55.061 --> 04:57.296
a makeup kind of dude,
all right?

04:57.363 --> 04:58.831
Oh, no worries. I've got
a concealer so good

04:58.898 --> 05:00.433
no one will ever even
know you're wearing it.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.069
(laughs) You're right,
'cause I'm not.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.838
Okay, but...

05:05.905 --> 05:07.674
it's only gonna get bigger.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.543
Judging from the size
and shadow,

05:10.610 --> 05:12.645
it's gonna blow
in about two hours.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.716
Call me.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.722
Oh, whoa, 7-Up cake,

05:22.789 --> 05:25.324
peach cobbler, bread pudding.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.993
What do you need me to fix?

05:28.394 --> 05:32.565
Oh, baby back ribs.
Fried snapper.

05:32.632 --> 05:33.866
This can't be fixed.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.601
What do you need me to buy?

05:35.668 --> 05:39.105
Well, the food is for
Dave and Gemma,

05:39.172 --> 05:41.941
and, um,
I've got some bad news.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.577
They lost the baby.

05:44.644 --> 05:47.013
(gasps)

05:44.644 --> 05:47.013
What?

05:47.080 --> 05:49.482
Oh, no, Mama.
That's terrible.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.451
It is.

05:51.517 --> 05:52.852
You okay, hon?

05:52.919 --> 05:56.656
Yeah. Just feeling bad
for Gemma and Dave.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.725
I know.

05:58.791 --> 06:00.593
Whoa, whoa, Ma,

06:00.660 --> 06:01.994
don't you think you're
going a little overboard?

06:02.061 --> 06:03.529
This is a lot of food.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.865
I know, but food is
my love language.

06:05.932 --> 06:09.635
Oh, Mommy, you are
the sweetest,

06:09.702 --> 06:11.437
kindest woman I know.

06:11.504 --> 06:13.473
Yes, you can have a piece.

06:15.842 --> 06:18.411
Okay, thanks, 'cause eating
is my love language.

06:23.182 --> 06:27.420
I'm sure this is stirring up
some sad memories,

06:27.487 --> 06:29.388
and I know you don't like
going there.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.491
Yeah, I-I don't.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.460
So can we not, babe? You know.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.395
Besides, that was
a long time ago.

06:37.497 --> 06:38.464
Yeah.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.834
Oh, damn.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.834
What?

06:41.901 --> 06:45.671
I just remembered I sent
Gemma and Dave that baby gift.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.173
It's supposed to arrive
tomorrow.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.008
Oh, well, you were just
trying to do something nice.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.643
How could you have known?

06:50.710 --> 06:53.613
Well, I don't want to
make them feel any worse.

06:53.679 --> 06:56.549
I gotta grab that package
before they see it.

06:56.616 --> 06:59.519
You're a good friend.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.655
You want to come with me
to drop this stuff off?

07:02.722 --> 07:05.992
Uh, no. You know,
I'm still dirty from work,

07:06.058 --> 07:07.860
and they probably
don't want to deal

07:07.927 --> 07:09.529
with a lot of people
right now.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.166
You know, just tell 'em
I send my love, okay?

07:13.232 --> 07:15.168
Will do.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.908
Devona?

07:20.006 --> 07:21.908
Mm-hmm?

07:21.974 --> 07:24.544
This right here
has got to stay

07:24.610 --> 07:26.579
just between the two of us.

07:26.646 --> 07:30.616
Don't worry, I take
artist-client confidentiality

07:30.683 --> 07:31.984
very serious.

07:32.051 --> 07:35.054
All right, good, because
none of the guys I know

07:35.121 --> 07:36.522
wear makeup.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.090
You mean none
that you know of.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.059
Wait. Really? Who?

07:40.126 --> 07:41.661
Is it Trey?
I knew it.

07:41.727 --> 07:44.197
I knew he wore mascara.

07:44.263 --> 07:46.666
That boy got eyelashes
like a horse.

07:46.732 --> 07:49.702
The men's makeup market
is blowing up.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.504
Even Alex Rodriguez
uses it.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.573
Wait, A-Rod wears makeup?

07:53.639 --> 07:55.641
Mm-hmm. He's even got
his own line.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.810
There is nothing wrong
with a man

07:57.877 --> 07:59.745
wanting to look his best.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.181
Oh, damn.

08:02.248 --> 08:03.783
You made it disappear.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.985
Can you do that
with my student loans?

08:06.052 --> 08:09.755
If I could,
I'd start with mine.

08:06.052 --> 08:09.755
(chuckles)

08:09.822 --> 08:12.692
Okay, so I'll drop your
products off tomorrow.

08:12.758 --> 08:15.127
Meantime, have fun
on your date

08:15.194 --> 08:17.196
with the Instagram model.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.196
Oh, I will.

08:17.263 --> 08:19.832
I may not be A-Rod,
but tonight,

08:19.899 --> 08:22.001
I see a home run
in my future.

08:23.903 --> 08:26.939
(door lock opening)

08:23.903 --> 08:26.939
Oh, crap, that's Marty.
Uh, close this.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.175
(both laugh)

08:31.878 --> 08:33.613
Hey, Devona.
What are you doing here?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.248
Oh, she was just, um...

08:35.314 --> 08:37.216
Just showing Malcolm
some products I think

08:37.283 --> 08:39.185
your mother would love
for her birthday.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.153
Right. Right.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.989
'Cause you know Mama.
Mama loves all that

08:43.055 --> 08:44.290
girly makeup stuff.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.959
Cool. I'll split it with you.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.959
All right.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.061
Okay, perfect, then.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.296
Malcolm, I'll talk
to you soon.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.098
All right.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.302
Oh, hey, man,

08:56.369 --> 08:59.038
did you hear Gemma
and Dave's bad news?

08:59.105 --> 09:01.207
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Mom told me.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.610
Maybe we should get them
some flowers and-and a card.

09:04.677 --> 09:08.080
Yeah. I just wish there was
something more we could do.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.683
All we can do is just
be there for 'em

09:10.750 --> 09:12.652
and keep them in prayer.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.787
Yeah, speaking of prayer,

09:14.854 --> 09:16.822
how did you get rid
of that zit so fast?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.626
I don't know.

09:20.693 --> 09:22.662
I guess God
just likes me being pretty.

09:25.998 --> 09:27.767
(knock on door)

09:31.871 --> 09:33.906
Oh, hey, Tina.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.906
Hey.

09:33.973 --> 09:36.642
I brought you a little
something to eat.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.683
How you feeling?

09:43.749 --> 09:45.751
Okay. Just keeping
busy, you know.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.586
Painting the walls,
painting the door.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.355
And evidently
painting Grover.

09:51.657 --> 09:54.060
Uh, yeah. I guess
I'm a little distracted.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.829
Well, I just wanted to
drop off a few meals,

09:56.896 --> 09:58.764
just in case you didn't
feel like cooking.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.266
Well, thanks, Tina.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.101
This should, uh,
carry us through winter.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.372
Gemma, I know I made
too much food,

10:06.439 --> 10:09.942
and I know there is nothing that
I can say to ease your pain.

10:10.009 --> 10:12.278
But I...

10:12.345 --> 10:15.815
I lost a baby between
Malcolm and Marty,

10:15.881 --> 10:19.051
and it is devastating.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.288
But you still have to...

10:20.286 --> 10:22.288
Move on. I know.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.956
That's what I'm
trying to do.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.925
Well, I was gonna say

10:25.992 --> 10:28.394
you still have to take
the time to grieve.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.863
Thanks.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.798
I'm just trying to stay
in a positive space.

10:32.865 --> 10:36.002
Good. Good, good, good.

10:36.068 --> 10:37.837
How you doing, Grover?

10:37.903 --> 10:39.805
I'm sad about the baby.

10:39.872 --> 10:42.808
I wanted to be a big brother.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.411
Oh, honey,
of course you did.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.847
Grover, I know
what'll cheer you up.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.916
You and I are going
to the arcade.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.819
I'm in the mood for
a Ms. Pac-Man rematch.

10:53.886 --> 10:57.023
Okay, I'll play some
old people games.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.793
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.400
Dave, I'm, uh,
worried about Gemma.

11:07.466 --> 11:09.435
She seems a little
disconnected.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.170
I've tried to talk to her,

11:11.237 --> 11:14.040
but she doesn't want
to dwell on the loss.

11:14.106 --> 11:15.708
Yeah, well,
I'm sure she's coping

11:15.775 --> 11:17.009
the best way she can.

11:17.076 --> 11:20.813
Losing a baby...

11:20.880 --> 11:23.349
is heartbreaking.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.451
Unfortunately, there's
no amount of paint

11:25.518 --> 11:28.020
that's gonna cover up
her pain.

11:29.455 --> 11:32.725
Well, how about you?
How you feeling?

11:32.792 --> 11:35.461
That was your baby, too.

11:38.064 --> 11:40.733
I know it was, Tina.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.371
Thank you for being here.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.006
You're welcome.

11:55.347 --> 11:57.416
Damn it, this ain't it.

11:57.483 --> 11:58.984
"Brooks Brothers"?

11:59.051 --> 12:01.020
Yeah, this ain't for
the real brothers.

12:02.955 --> 12:05.191
Oh, hey, Calvin.

12:02.955 --> 12:05.191
Oh, hey.

12:05.257 --> 12:07.426
These, uh...
these are for you.

12:07.493 --> 12:11.197
Ooh, my camo Crocs.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.165
It confuses the insects.

12:15.034 --> 12:18.003
So, uh, where's your usual

12:18.070 --> 12:21.373
too-short shorts?

12:18.070 --> 12:21.373
Oh, I don't know.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.443
Too depressed
to run sexy.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.345
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

12:26.412 --> 12:30.349
Listen, did Tina tell you that
I sent my love? Because I did.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.885
Yeah, she did, and I really
appreciate your support.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.987
She also mentioned you guys
had a miscarriage.

12:35.054 --> 12:38.324
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
That was a long time ago.

12:38.390 --> 12:40.493
You know what, I'm gonna
let you get to your run.

12:40.559 --> 12:42.795
'Cause you know,
times like these,

12:42.862 --> 12:44.330
exercise is very important.

12:44.396 --> 12:46.031
Matter of fact,
I'm gonna jog home.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.066
Okay? All right.
Bye, Dave.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.276
Mama, your favorite
son is here.

12:57.343 --> 12:58.911
Hey, Malcolm.

12:58.978 --> 13:00.880
Ooh, your pimple's not
joining us for dinner?

13:00.946 --> 13:03.449
I set a place at the table
for it and everything.

13:03.516 --> 13:07.052
Well, that zit is gone, and
thanks to these smooth cheeks,

13:07.119 --> 13:09.221
my date last night was amazing.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.157
'Cause forget Instagram,
she followed me

13:11.223 --> 13:13.459
straight back to my...

13:13.526 --> 13:16.495
to my church meeting, Mama.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.933
Yeah, don't bring God
into your ratchetness.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.168
(laughs)

13:24.003 --> 13:25.404
What, Ma?

13:25.471 --> 13:28.140
I don't know, you're looking
especially handsome today.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.075
Oh, yeah?

13:30.142 --> 13:32.411
Yeah.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.411
Oh, yeah.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.546
You do look good.

13:33.612 --> 13:35.114
You losing some weight?

13:35.181 --> 13:37.516
Uh, yeah, you know,
I'm just drinking water,

13:37.583 --> 13:40.286
eating clean, working out,
doing me.

13:42.621 --> 13:45.024
Oh, good, you intercepted
the baby gift.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.392
Oh, no, not yet.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.427
I just saw Devona,
your makeup lady,

13:48.494 --> 13:51.497
dropping your makeup at Malcolm
and Marty's by mistake.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.365
I didn't order any makeup.

13:53.432 --> 13:55.601
You know what, Mom, let me
go ahead and grab this.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.438
God knows what else that lady
is hiding on my porch.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.141
Uh-uh, there might be
some free samples

14:02.208 --> 14:04.410
in here or something.

14:04.476 --> 14:07.046
"Man-Kup.
Strong enough for a woman,

14:07.112 --> 14:08.881
but weak enough for a man."

14:08.948 --> 14:12.518
Hmm. Not any men
that I know, all right.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.287
We don't need these kind
of samples in this house.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.290
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop. It's for me.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.259
All right, you know what
I was dealing with.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.896
I have a pimple the size
of Kilimanjaro on my face.

14:23.963 --> 14:25.030
I had to do something.

14:25.097 --> 14:27.633
Oh, so that's why
you been looking

14:27.700 --> 14:28.968
extra Denzel.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.970
You ain't drinking no water.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.908
Look, it's... it's not
a big deal, okay?

14:35.975 --> 14:37.977
It's just a little
cover-up for men.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.012
Oh, it's okay, honey,
there's nothing wrong with

14:40.079 --> 14:42.648
a little glow-up to make you
look and feel your best.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.183
Thank you, Ma.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.352
Hey, man, look,
I'm with Mom, okay.

14:46.418 --> 14:47.953
Do what makes you feel good.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.888
Although,
with this flawless skin,

14:49.955 --> 14:51.523
I don't ever need
to wear makeup.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.425
My dermatologist says I have
the pores of a six-year-old.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.632
What in the RuPaul is
going on in here?

14:59.698 --> 15:01.200
All right, look, look, Pop,

15:01.267 --> 15:03.102
at first it did
feel weird, right?

15:03.168 --> 15:05.170
But then I thought why
shouldn't I do something

15:05.237 --> 15:06.605
if it makes me feel better?

15:06.672 --> 15:09.441
I'm still me, I'm just
a little bit smoother.

15:09.508 --> 15:12.578
Son, men aren't supposed
to be smooth.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.446
Supposed to be rough and bumpy.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.215
That's what makes us men.

15:16.282 --> 15:19.418
Pop, those are outdated
gender roles, okay?

15:19.485 --> 15:21.353
Look, even A-Rod has
a makeup line.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.289
Well, if you hit
that many home runs,

15:23.355 --> 15:25.224
sure, you could wear
a little mascara.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.528
I don't use mascara, Pop.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.063
It's concealer.

15:31.130 --> 15:34.500
Well, it's
a slippery slope, son.

15:34.566 --> 15:37.169
I mean, today it's concealer,

15:37.236 --> 15:39.138
tomorrow it's
a Brazilian butt lift.

15:39.204 --> 15:40.372
I'm telling you.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.140
(Alexa chimes)

15:40.439 --> 15:41.140
Hold on.

15:41.206 --> 15:41.940
She's trying to say
something.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.543
Alexa, what are
my notifications?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.211
ALEXA:
Your package has been delivered.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.447
Oh, damn, I gotta go.

15:48.514 --> 15:51.150
Did she tell you
the name of the shade

15:51.216 --> 15:53.018
of that concealer
she used on you?

15:53.085 --> 15:54.687
Oh, come on, Ma.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.687
What?

15:54.753 --> 15:58.157
I'm just mad that you
look prettier than me.

15:58.223 --> 16:01.026
Hey, Gemma, look,
I'm sorry.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.028
I, uh... I sent that
before I...

16:03.095 --> 16:06.065
Oh, no, no, no.
It's-it's all good.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.300
I'm-I'm-- I just need to
get back to my painting.

16:08.367 --> 16:09.568
I'm fine. It's fine.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.503
Gemma.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.503
No, no, no.
I just...

16:11.570 --> 16:13.105
The color's all wrong,

16:13.172 --> 16:15.107
and it's taking longer
than I thought.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.642
And I just--
I need to get it right.

16:16.709 --> 16:20.145
(crying, mumbling)
I need to get it right.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.186
Sorry, Calvin.

16:28.454 --> 16:30.022
Don't be.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.491
All right? What you're
going through is awful.

16:32.558 --> 16:35.060
I just don't want
to feel this.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.463
It makes it real.

16:37.529 --> 16:39.565
My baby's gone.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.735
Ugh. I just want to be numb.

16:46.405 --> 16:49.341
I-I know that you're afraid

16:49.408 --> 16:52.544
that if you--
if you let the hurt in,

16:52.611 --> 16:54.747
it'll just swallow you up.

16:54.813 --> 16:58.417
I mean, that's how I felt
when Tina and I...

16:58.484 --> 17:00.719
lost our little girl.

17:02.488 --> 17:06.458
But, uh, you know,

17:06.525 --> 17:11.196
the more I tried to...
avoid the pain,

17:11.263 --> 17:13.031
the more it lingered.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.100
And I just don't
want that for you.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.769
It just feels like

17:16.835 --> 17:20.539
I'm never gonna
be okay again.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.574
Did it ever go away?

17:22.641 --> 17:25.544
I thought it did,
I mean, but...

17:25.611 --> 17:27.613
when this thing
happened to you guys,

17:27.679 --> 17:31.283
it all came rushing back.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.619
And I didn't want
to talk about it either.

17:33.685 --> 17:37.790
And now that I'm here,
sharing this moment with you,

17:37.856 --> 17:42.161
I realize I needed
to hear these words myself.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.597
Yeah.

17:45.664 --> 17:48.600
You're gonna get
through this, Gemma.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.436
Promise?

17:50.502 --> 17:53.272
I promise, sweetheart.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.707
I got you.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.254
So it's okay to talk
about what happened now?

18:09.321 --> 18:11.590
Yeah, of course, sweetie.

18:11.657 --> 18:14.159
I'm sorry I didn't let you
talk about your feelings.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.395
But that's why
we're planting this tree,

18:16.462 --> 18:18.363
so that we can always
remember the baby.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.666
I'm still sad, though.

18:20.732 --> 18:24.403
We all are, buddy,
but you know, it's okay.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.306
We're a family, and we'll
always be there for each other.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.107
Even in the toughest times.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.811
The Butlers will always
be there for you guys, too.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.181
Hey.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.181
Thanks for coming, guys.

18:36.248 --> 18:37.483
Hey, honey.

18:36.248 --> 18:37.483
Of course, Dave.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.184
You okay?

18:37.549 --> 18:39.184
Yeah.

18:39.251 --> 18:41.787
Hey, Tina, I hope I'm not
putting you on the spot, but...

18:41.854 --> 18:43.255
would you sing something?

18:43.322 --> 18:45.891
Oh. (chuckles)
Of course I will.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.659
Um, what should I sing?

18:47.726 --> 18:50.729
You know what, Ma?
How about "Gone Too Soon"?

18:50.796 --> 18:52.664
Oh, that's
a beautiful idea, son.

No, David!

20:07.539 --> 20:09.641
(indistinct chatter)

20:16.682 --> 20:18.684
Babe...

20:20.819 --> 20:23.889
...did you move my skin toner?

20:23.956 --> 20:25.924
Oh, it's in the upper right
cabinet.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.259
Oh.

20:27.326 --> 20:28.160
You know,

20:28.226 --> 20:30.762
you've got some nerve
teasing Malcolm

20:30.829 --> 20:32.831
when you use cosmetics, too.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.400
Oh, well, hold on now.

20:35.467 --> 20:38.403
Foundation and mascara,
that's makeup.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.606
My stuff is toiletries.

20:40.672 --> 20:45.410
Hardcore, manly toiletries.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.750
Looking for your
beard dye, Idris?

20:54.353 --> 20:55.587
Mind your business, Tina.
