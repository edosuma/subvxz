00:53.696 --> 00:54.720
TED: Cup my balls.

00:54.964 --> 00:57.592
ANNlE: Okay, yes.
All right. l can do that.

TED: Oh! There it is.
ANNlE: There we go.

01:00.937 --> 01:02.131
That feels good.

01:02.605 --> 01:04.539
You know what to do.

01:06.376 --> 01:08.776
Okay, you know what?
Slow it down, slow it down.

01:08.878 --> 01:10.743
Okay.
Slow it down.

01:11.447 --> 01:12.573
There we go.
How's that?

01:12.682 --> 01:16.516
That's good, nice and slow.
See? Doesn't that feel good?

01:16.619 --> 01:17.813
Yeah.
No, l want to go fast.

01:17.921 --> 01:19.684
You want to go fast?
Fast.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.457
Yeah. No.. .

01:24.560 --> 01:25.891
Oh, yeah.
That feels good.

01:25.995 --> 01:27.292
Oh, Yeah.

01:27.397 --> 01:28.523
Yeah.

01:30.533 --> 01:32.160
Okay.
You know what?
l think.. .

01:32.268 --> 01:34.065
l think maybe
we are on different
rhythms here.

02:21.117 --> 02:23.950
l was having a nightmare.
l was so scared.

02:25.488 --> 02:26.455
Good morning.

02:26.556 --> 02:27.523
Good morning.

02:28.458 --> 02:31.120
You look beautiful.

02:31.227 --> 02:32.558
No, l'm sure
l look terrible.

02:32.662 --> 02:34.596
l just woke up.
Are you kidding?

02:34.697 --> 02:36.426
l'm sure l'm a mess.

02:37.667 --> 02:38.691
You slept over.

02:38.801 --> 02:40.462
l did.

02:40.570 --> 02:43.130
l thought we had
a rule against that.

02:43.373 --> 02:44.340
Oh.

02:44.574 --> 02:46.303
l'm kidding.
Oh.

02:46.676 --> 02:47.768
That was funny.
l'm kidding.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.708
You're funny
in the morning.

02:49.846 --> 02:51.370
l like hanging out
with you.
Oh. Yeah.

02:51.481 --> 02:54.882
l love hanging out with you.
l think we get
along really well

02:54.984 --> 02:58.647
and you're so sexy.

02:59.122 --> 03:00.555
l know.

03:01.824 --> 03:05.954
l just have a lot
coming up at work

03:06.062 --> 03:08.690
and l don't want
to make promises
l can't keep.

03:08.898 --> 03:10.559
You know what l mean?
l know you do.

03:10.666 --> 03:12.634
Yeah.
We're on the same page.

03:12.735 --> 03:15.670
l'm not looking for
a relationship right now,
either. Let's just say that.

03:15.772 --> 03:18.570
Whatever you wanna.. .
l can do.. .

03:18.674 --> 03:22.576
l'd rather just.. .
l like simple.. .
l'm not like other girls.

03:22.678 --> 03:25.738
l'm not like,
''Be my boyfriend!''
Unless you were like, ''Yeah!''

03:25.848 --> 03:27.816
Then l'd be like,
''Maybe.' '

03:28.384 --> 03:30.215
Mmm. But let's not.

03:30.319 --> 03:32.310
l don't want that either.

03:43.566 --> 03:45.557
Wow, this is so awkward.
l really want you to leave,

03:45.668 --> 03:49.434
but l don't know how to say it
without sounding like a dick.

04:48.898 --> 04:51.230
Come on!
Hands behind your heads!
Let's go! Sit-ups!

04:51.701 --> 04:54.761
You're looking
like pieces of bacon
on a plate.

04:54.871 --> 04:57.772
lt's disgusting!
l smell the fat!

04:58.574 --> 05:00.439
He scares me.
Me, too.

05:00.543 --> 05:01.635
LlLLlAN: But he's
an excellent motivator.

05:01.811 --> 05:02.937
That's true.

05:03.045 --> 05:04.979
What are you looking at?

05:05.748 --> 05:07.238
Oh, Shit, he sees us.
Oh, God.

05:07.416 --> 05:09.077
Hey! Hey!

05:09.519 --> 05:11.009
lf you want to
take this class,

05:11.287 --> 05:13.187
you're going to
have to pay for it

05:13.356 --> 05:15.290
like the rest
of these bitches!

05:15.391 --> 05:18.451
What, are you dancing?
ln the park.. .
Dance class?

05:18.661 --> 05:21.425
You are not dancing.
You are not
dancing in the park!

05:21.631 --> 05:23.394
Go, go, go, go!
lNSTRUCTOR: Freeloaders!

05:23.666 --> 05:24.655
l'm coming over there.

05:24.967 --> 05:26.298
ls he coming?
lNSTRUCTOR:
l'm coming after you!

05:26.402 --> 05:28.768
Sorry, Rodney.
We're on a budget.

05:28.871 --> 05:31.169
lNSTRUCTOR: Oh, come on!
lt's only 12 bucks!

05:31.440 --> 05:32.771
Oh, my God!

05:33.042 --> 05:35.408
Come on!
You fucking freeloaders.

05:38.214 --> 05:39.841
We are out
of our minds.
l know.

05:39.949 --> 05:41.940
That's okay.
l'm so glad that
we got to do this.

05:42.051 --> 05:43.211
l feel like l haven't
seen you in forever.

05:43.786 --> 05:44.844
Mmm. l've been
in Chicago a lot.

05:45.054 --> 05:46.954
l know.
Sleeping at Dougie's house.

05:47.056 --> 05:48.648
Well, it's just
closer to work.

05:48.958 --> 05:50.220
How is it going
with him anyway?

05:51.360 --> 05:53.191
l don't know.
l mean, it's fine,

05:53.362 --> 05:55.227
but l just feel
like he's been
distant lately.

05:55.331 --> 05:57.026
And l don't know.. .

05:57.633 --> 05:59.601
He calls me
''dude'' a lot.

05:59.702 --> 06:00.760
That doesn't mean anything.

06:01.003 --> 06:02.265
l think everything is fine.

06:02.371 --> 06:03.770
l don't know.
Anyway,

06:04.006 --> 06:05.598
what did you
do last night?

06:06.576 --> 06:07.565
Umm.. .

06:07.677 --> 06:09.110
What did you
do last night?

06:11.514 --> 06:13.106
You are not
telling me something.

06:15.151 --> 06:16.550
l hung out with
Ted for a little bit.

06:16.786 --> 06:19.550
l knew it!
We had fun.

06:20.022 --> 06:21.717
lt was fun.
Here's what l
don't like about it.

06:22.058 --> 06:25.084
You hate yourself
after you see him,
every time.

06:25.661 --> 06:27.424
And then we go through this,
and then you feel like shit,

06:27.530 --> 06:28.929
and it's almost
like you're doing it

06:29.098 --> 06:30.531
because you feel
bad about yourself.

06:31.067 --> 06:34.332
He called me late,
and we hung out.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.031
lt wasn't a big deal.
And you know what?
lt was fun.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.465
Ew! You had
sex with him.

06:40.543 --> 06:43.842
We had an
adult sleepover.

06:45.014 --> 06:47.539
Ooh. Did you let him
sleep over in your mouth?

06:50.119 --> 06:51.609
Annie!
l'm sorry!

06:51.721 --> 06:55.657
You're unbelievable.
He kept putting
it near my face.

06:56.092 --> 06:57.116
They do that,
don't they?

06:57.293 --> 06:58.317
Why do they do that?
Let us offer.

06:58.694 --> 06:59.661
lf we don't offer.. .

06:59.829 --> 07:00.796
Please.
You're supposed
to slap it away.

07:00.896 --> 07:01.863
l couldn't.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.726
You don't want to
look right at it.

07:05.901 --> 07:07.027
No.

07:07.136 --> 07:10.162
lt's too aggressive.
lt's like.. .

07:10.273 --> 07:11.604
''Hello.' '

07:11.707 --> 07:12.731
That's my impression.

07:12.842 --> 07:13.809
Those are the balls?

07:13.909 --> 07:15.433
Yeah.
l'm trying to make it round,

07:15.611 --> 07:17.135
but l can't
because l have elbows.

07:19.849 --> 07:20.838
He is so hot, though.

07:21.050 --> 07:25.214
Look, l know
you say he's cute
and all that stuff,

07:25.321 --> 07:27.255
but it makes you feel
like shit, you know?

07:27.356 --> 07:29.324
You're a total catch,
and any guy

07:29.492 --> 07:31.460
would be psyched
to be your man.

07:31.694 --> 07:33.889
You should just
make room

07:34.397 --> 07:36.422
for somebody who
is nice to you.

07:36.532 --> 07:38.523
You know what?
He's honest!

07:38.634 --> 07:40.329
He told me that
we are what we are

07:40.503 --> 07:42.232
and we're just having fun.
And l like that.

07:42.338 --> 07:45.501
He also told you that
you need dental work.
He's an asshole.

07:47.943 --> 07:51.401
l don't need dental work.

07:51.914 --> 07:53.040
You're right.

07:53.215 --> 07:54.375
There is nothing
wrong with my teeth.

07:54.483 --> 07:56.348
You are so beautiful.

07:56.686 --> 07:58.654
Will you marry me?
Yes.

08:01.724 --> 08:02.691
l love you.

08:02.858 --> 08:03.825
l love you.

08:04.627 --> 08:07.687
l don't want to
go to work today.
Mmm-mmm.

08:07.797 --> 08:09.822
Let's see how many
times Terry's called me.

08:09.932 --> 08:10.899
Oh! Only 15!

08:11.300 --> 08:12.562
You know what, Terry?
l don't want

08:12.668 --> 08:14.431
to pick up your
monkey lamps.
Sorry!

08:15.071 --> 08:16.595
Monkey lamps?

08:16.706 --> 08:19.539
Ugh. l cannot wait
to never work for
a psychopath again.

08:21.077 --> 08:22.135
Oh! Annie!

08:22.244 --> 08:25.179
l'm sorry. l should
have gone down Mason.

08:25.514 --> 08:28.847
ANNlE: Well, l'm the genius
that opened a bakery
during the recession.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.284
They were good cakes,
Annie.

08:31.387 --> 08:32.683
Thank you.

08:33.688 --> 08:35.884
Come on. Look away,
look away, look away.

08:39.628 --> 08:41.755
Do you have any
ideas of styles?

08:41.864 --> 08:42.990
Oh, l don't know.
What do you think, honey?

08:43.164 --> 08:44.291
Whatever you want.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.400
Look at how you guys
are making this
decision together.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.627
That's sweet. You guys
love each other, huh?

08:48.738 --> 08:50.205
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:50.773 --> 08:53.071
Ohh! That's sweet.
That will go away.

08:56.112 --> 09:00.845
You cannot
trust anybody, ever.

09:01.350 --> 09:03.147
Especially someone
you're in a
relationship with.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.651
'Cause they're
living with you,
you don't

09:04.820 --> 09:06.253
know who you're
sleeping next to.
lt is scary.

09:06.889 --> 09:09.949
l mean, look at him.
He may not even be Asian.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.125
lt is scary.

09:14.430 --> 09:17.024
So did you guys
want to look at
these engagement rings?

09:17.533 --> 09:19.364
We're going to browse.
Okay, sure.

09:19.602 --> 09:20.762
l'll be here.

09:24.673 --> 09:25.970
Thank you.

09:26.909 --> 09:27.876
What was that about?

09:29.111 --> 09:31.739
Umm, nothing.
They had to run.
They had to go somewhere.

09:31.847 --> 09:34.008
And no wonder.
You're selling
lifelong happiness.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.141
You're not telling everyone
about your problems

09:36.252 --> 09:37.719
and how your
boyfriend left you,

09:37.887 --> 09:39.377
and maybe marriage
will work out.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.022
Show me your
''love is eternal'' face.

09:44.493 --> 09:47.656
No, that's two years,
four years tops.
That is not eternal.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.527
Kahlua, can you
come over here
for a second, please?

09:50.633 --> 09:52.328
What's up, Don-Don?

09:52.868 --> 09:54.995
You make up
the best nicknames.

09:55.171 --> 09:57.901
You don't need
a nickname because
Kahlua is so delicious.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.200
Don't sue me
for touching you.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.804
Show Annie your
''love is eternal'' face.

10:09.885 --> 10:12.012
That looks like you
have menstrual cramps.

10:12.588 --> 10:13.577
Thank you so much,
Kahlua.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.252
Now, why can't you
be more like Kahlua?

10:19.361 --> 10:20.385
Look, l'm trying
really hard.

10:20.563 --> 10:21.587
You've just
got to try harder.

10:21.697 --> 10:23.494
The whole reason
you have got this job,
Annie,

10:23.599 --> 10:26.534
is because your mom
is my sponsor in AA,
and l'm doing her a favor.

10:26.635 --> 10:27.602
l understand.

10:29.271 --> 10:31.205
Oscar, get back to work.

10:33.943 --> 10:35.103
You shouldn't be
behind the counter.

10:41.517 --> 10:44.077
MAN ON TV: <i>Andrew,</i>
<i>you are not the father!</i>

10:46.222 --> 10:47.917
That's great. Yeah.

10:50.626 --> 10:52.753
Stop that.
Don't do that.

10:54.797 --> 10:55.991
Hey, Brynn.

10:56.098 --> 10:57.463
Oh, hey, roomie.

10:58.334 --> 11:00.234
Guess what
happened to me today.
Hmm. What?

11:00.970 --> 11:02.460
l got a free tattoo.
You did what?

11:02.738 --> 11:05.400
l could not believe it.
The guy said,
''Do you want a tattoo?''

11:05.508 --> 11:06.475
Just a random.. .

11:06.575 --> 11:08.304
Yeah, opened up
the side of his van.
No.

11:08.410 --> 11:10.810
He said, ''lt's for free!''
And l said, ''Sure.' '

11:11.280 --> 11:12.247
You said yes?
Yeah!

11:12.348 --> 11:14.714
Yeah. Look.
See here?

11:14.817 --> 11:16.148
What is it?

11:16.919 --> 11:18.284
See that?

11:18.988 --> 11:20.888
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Brynn!

11:20.990 --> 11:23.288
lt's a Mexican drinking worm.

11:23.425 --> 11:26.622
lt's a Native American
symbol meaning ''wasted.' '

11:26.729 --> 11:28.720
Okay, Brynn,
just so you know,
it's.. .

11:28.831 --> 11:30.423
Gil, hi.
Hello. How are you?

11:30.533 --> 11:33.161
Have you seen
your sister's tattoo?
lt's really infected.

11:33.335 --> 11:34.393
Better get
a little bit of ice on it.

11:34.570 --> 11:35.662
Yeah, a little bit.

11:35.771 --> 11:37.102
Stick some
frozen peas on there.

11:37.206 --> 11:39.231
Yeah. lt can't hurt.
All right.

11:39.341 --> 11:41.605
So, l just wanted
a quick word.

11:42.311 --> 11:44.541
You know that
tomorrow the rent is due.

11:44.647 --> 11:45.773
l was getting my check,
and l wondered

11:45.948 --> 11:47.108
if l could get
your check, too?

11:47.383 --> 11:49.476
Yes.
l'm getting
the money.

11:49.585 --> 11:52.247
lt's been
a little slow.

11:54.723 --> 11:58.215
You have to
keep it in the bag
and put the bag on it.

12:03.799 --> 12:05.892
So, the check?

12:06.235 --> 12:08.066
Yes. Yes.
Yeah.

12:08.170 --> 12:11.503
Because it's a kind of,
like, ''needing it
today''-type situation.

12:11.607 --> 12:12.665
lt's coming.

12:15.044 --> 12:16.341
LlLLlAN: Who is it?
ANNlE: Me!

12:16.478 --> 12:17.502
Who is it?

12:17.880 --> 12:19.472
Oh, my God.
Hurry up, your creepy
neighbor asked me

12:19.582 --> 12:21.072
if l wanted to
watch the news again.

12:21.183 --> 12:22.707
Sorry.
He is so gross.

12:22.818 --> 12:25.252
Please, come on in.
Let me take your magazines.

12:25.354 --> 12:28.414
Welcome to the magazine
and wine party. Ooh!

12:28.958 --> 12:30.391
Have a seat.

12:30.492 --> 12:32.722
l'm very happy
that you are here.

12:32.828 --> 12:35.820
What?
Because l want
to eat an apple.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.463
Would you like
some apple?

12:40.703 --> 12:42.728
What is that?
l got engaged.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.400
What?
He asked me last night.

12:44.506 --> 12:46.133
What?
l know!

12:46.375 --> 12:47.706
That's why he's
been acting so weird

12:47.810 --> 12:49.971
'cause he's a terrible liar,
and he thought he
was gonna blow it.

12:50.079 --> 12:51.068
He was ignoring
me and l thought

12:51.246 --> 12:52.270
he was going to
break up with me.

12:52.381 --> 12:53.473
Oh, my gosh.

12:55.851 --> 12:56.818
Oh, my gosh!

12:56.986 --> 12:57.975
l know!

12:58.253 --> 12:59.584
Lil!

12:59.755 --> 13:01.120
l'm shocked, still.

13:01.357 --> 13:02.722
But l'm happy.
Can you believe this?

13:02.825 --> 13:05.589
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, l just got hot.

13:05.928 --> 13:06.917
You did?
Are you okay?

13:07.029 --> 13:07.996
Yes. My pits
are sweating.

13:08.097 --> 13:09.655
My stomach hurts. l'm hot.
What does that mean?

13:09.765 --> 13:12.893
Oh, my God!
What is happening?

13:13.035 --> 13:15.128
l don't know.
l'm wearing a ring.

13:15.671 --> 13:16.797
l can't believe it.

13:16.905 --> 13:18.065
Lil, you're getting married.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.434
l'm getting married.

13:20.075 --> 13:22.043
And you'll be
my maid of honor.

13:22.311 --> 13:24.677
God, of course l will!

13:24.780 --> 13:26.111
lt will be super fun.
lt's gonna be really fun.

13:26.215 --> 13:28.240
Yeah. You know,
we can plan
everything together.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.841
My God!
Planning your wedding.. .

13:31.020 --> 13:32.214
Are you sure
you're up for it?

13:32.321 --> 13:34.551
l know it's a lot to ask
and to put on your plate.

13:34.657 --> 13:37.592
And you're going
through a tricky time,
and you're super-busy.. .

13:37.693 --> 13:39.183
Stop.
lt's a lot to ask.

13:39.294 --> 13:40.283
Stop.
Okay.

13:40.396 --> 13:44.127
lt's fine. And l'm
more than happy to do it,
and it's not too much.

13:46.068 --> 13:47.467
Oh! Look at that.
lt's my fiancé calling.

13:47.636 --> 13:49.035
Oh, your fiancé.

13:49.138 --> 13:50.662
Hi, baby,
what's up?

13:52.241 --> 13:55.142
lt's Annie.
l just told her!
Yeah, she's so happy.

13:55.244 --> 13:56.506
No, l'm not!

13:57.513 --> 13:58.775
''Yay,'' she said.

14:00.349 --> 14:01.816
What, baby?

14:02.284 --> 14:04.218
l know,
l miss you, too.

14:05.587 --> 14:07.851
Yeah,
l'll meet you in an hour.

14:08.691 --> 14:10.022
l love you, too.

14:33.782 --> 14:34.806
ANNlE: <i>Wow.</i>

14:35.617 --> 14:37.050
Wynonna Judd.

14:37.352 --> 14:38.876
That's really good.

14:39.021 --> 14:42.718
Painting those giant bangs
was a royal pain in my can.

14:42.825 --> 14:45.851
And those teeth!
l should have
painted her mouth shut.

14:45.994 --> 14:48.326
Can you just get dressed?
We're gonna be late
for the engagement party.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.522
Oh, l forgot
to tell you, honey.
What?

14:49.631 --> 14:50.757
Forgot to tell you.
What?

14:50.866 --> 14:54.666
l signed up to
speak at AA tonight,
and l just have to.

14:54.770 --> 14:55.964
Mom!
No.

14:56.071 --> 14:58.539
l forgot. l'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.074
l keep telling you,
you're not supposed
to go to those things.

15:01.176 --> 15:02.234
You're not an alcoholic.

15:02.344 --> 15:04.278
Only because l've
never had a drink.

15:05.214 --> 15:07.478
What?
They are inspiring.

15:07.783 --> 15:10.183
There is this one story
l've just got to tell you.
Sit down.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.616
Okay.

15:11.787 --> 15:13.152
This gentleman

15:13.255 --> 15:16.383
who started
blow-jobbing to get crack.
His name is Marvin Johnson.. .

15:16.658 --> 15:20.253
Mom, anonymous.
You keep.. . lt's no names.
Okay, okay.

15:20.496 --> 15:22.589
Forget it.
Marvin J. Whatever.

15:22.931 --> 15:25.263
Too late.
Well, he became
a gay prostitute.

15:25.367 --> 15:27.665
And he realized that
he had hit his bottom.

15:27.770 --> 15:30.295
And l have been thinking,
honey,

15:30.405 --> 15:33.238
that maybe this
is your bottom.

15:33.442 --> 15:37.139
l'm telling you,
hitting bottom
is a good thing.

15:37.279 --> 15:38.974
Because there's
nowhere to go but up.

15:39.148 --> 15:40.877
Because there's
nowhere to go but up.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.382
Right?
Yep. That's what you say.

15:42.684 --> 15:44.675
Yeah, a positive message.
Yeah.

15:45.053 --> 15:46.850
Yeah. Thanks for
the pep talk, Mom.

15:46.955 --> 15:49.014
Honey. Anytime, anytime.

15:49.124 --> 15:51.820
All right. l guess l'm
going to Lillian's party
by myself, then.

15:52.394 --> 15:54.225
Don't talk to me
about being by yourself.

15:54.396 --> 15:56.626
l go everywhere
by myself.

15:56.732 --> 15:58.256
Thanks to that
new whore, Barb.

15:58.367 --> 16:00.130
Mom, come on.
No, l don't like to say it.

16:00.269 --> 16:02.032
They've been
married 12 years.

16:02.204 --> 16:03.967
Okay.
But she's still a whore.

16:04.072 --> 16:07.530
l'm sure she greets
him in the evening,
beaver first.

16:10.599 --> 16:11.623
l don't want to
think about that.

16:11.734 --> 16:14.760
l bet she got that car
by giving your dad
something sexually.

16:14.870 --> 16:16.997
'Cause there was
one thing l would
never do,

16:17.106 --> 16:18.539
and l'm sure Barb
is a champion at it.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.732
l don't want to know.

16:19.842 --> 16:21.742
lt's called
a ''chicken coop.' '
Of course it is.

16:21.844 --> 16:23.709
You start at the back
and you peck your way

16:23.812 --> 16:25.177
to the front like
you have a beak.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.511
And then you end up
with two eggs
in your mouth.

16:30.285 --> 16:31.343
That's gross.

16:31.487 --> 16:33.079
Well, l'm sure
your dad likes it.

16:33.188 --> 16:35.452
Of course,
he grew up on a farm.

16:35.557 --> 16:36.524
Okay.

16:37.526 --> 16:38.720
You sure you don't want
to move in with me?

16:39.628 --> 16:42.256
Mom, thanks,
but no way.

16:42.498 --> 16:43.795
No way in hell.
Yeah?

16:43.899 --> 16:44.866
No, thanks.

16:45.367 --> 16:46.356
Think about it.
Okay.

16:48.152 --> 16:48.846
You don't need
your own place.

16:48.953 --> 16:50.079
Yeah, l kind of do.
Okay.

16:50.188 --> 16:51.155
All right,
l'm going to go.
All right.

17:13.211 --> 17:14.609
Holy shit.

17:17.615 --> 17:19.276
Ohh. Valet. Perfect.

17:22.819 --> 17:24.753
Sorry.
Needs a wash.

17:31.562 --> 17:33.962
You have to
punch it a few times.

17:46.911 --> 17:48.037
Annie!

17:48.646 --> 17:49.977
Oh, my God!

17:50.948 --> 17:52.973
Oh, my God,
Lillian.
l know.

17:53.184 --> 17:55.175
This is your
engagement party.
lsn't that crazy?

17:55.286 --> 17:56.913
lt's so beautiful.

17:57.021 --> 17:58.989
l can't believe
Dougie's boss
is a member here.

17:59.156 --> 18:02.648
l know,
and his parents, too.
And Dougie, l guess.

18:03.127 --> 18:04.958
Gosh, and me,
l guess, too, now.

18:05.530 --> 18:07.964
Come on, let's go
say hi to the rest
of the bridal party!

18:08.566 --> 18:10.659
You remember
my cousin Rita?

18:10.968 --> 18:12.799
Rita.
Annie.

18:13.170 --> 18:16.662
l haven't seen you
since you
graduated high school.

18:16.941 --> 18:18.033
She has
three kids now.

18:18.209 --> 18:20.268
Three boys.
LlLLlAN: They're so cute.

18:20.511 --> 18:23.002
They are cute,
but when they
reach that age,

18:23.247 --> 18:24.475
they are disgusting.

18:24.582 --> 18:26.482
They smell,
they are sticky,

18:26.784 --> 18:28.649
they say things
that are horrible,

18:28.753 --> 18:31.779
and there is semen all
over everything, okay?

18:32.390 --> 18:33.448
Disgusting.

18:33.691 --> 18:35.625
l cracked
a blanket in half.

18:35.860 --> 18:37.452
Do you get where
l'm going with that?
l do.

18:37.562 --> 18:38.722
l cracked it
in half.

18:38.896 --> 18:40.056
What?

18:40.364 --> 18:42.798
LlLLlAN: Annie,
this is Becca,
my friend from work.

18:42.900 --> 18:43.889
We are in
the trenches together.

18:44.001 --> 18:45.093
Hey. lt's great
to meet you.
Hey, how are you?

18:45.336 --> 18:46.428
Nice to meet you.

18:46.604 --> 18:47.730
This is my husband,
Kevin.

18:47.838 --> 18:48.998
Hi.
''Husband.' '

18:49.106 --> 18:50.300
l like to say it.
We are newlyweds.

18:50.608 --> 18:51.632
Wow. Congratulations.

18:51.809 --> 18:52.867
Thank you so much.

18:53.444 --> 18:55.571
We went on
a sweetheart honeymoon.
Oh.

18:56.681 --> 18:57.943
Where did you guys go?

18:58.049 --> 18:59.414
Disney World.
Disney World.

18:59.517 --> 19:00.848
We finish each
other's sentences.
Sorry.

19:05.389 --> 19:06.583
Sorry.
ls this your husband?

19:08.492 --> 19:10.357
No, no, no, no, no.

19:10.461 --> 19:12.156
l don't know him.
l'm sorry.

19:12.530 --> 19:14.998
Do you want to go
for a walk later?

19:15.499 --> 19:16.693
Oh. l can't.

19:17.234 --> 19:18.963
All right.
l can't. l'm sorry.

19:19.370 --> 19:20.359
l'm so sorry.

19:20.471 --> 19:22.530
l'm not with anybody.
l'm here solo.

19:23.441 --> 19:26.604
Let's start it again.
l'm Becca.
Rewind.

19:26.711 --> 19:29.680
This is my husband.
You don't have a husband.

19:30.648 --> 19:31.774
Sorry.

19:31.882 --> 19:34.680
And this is
Dougie's sister, Megan.

19:34.785 --> 19:35.843
Hey.
ANNlE: Hi.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.420
My grandma is not
supposed to have wine.
l'll be right back.

19:41.425 --> 19:43.450
Hey.
Hey. How is it going?

19:43.561 --> 19:46.496
lt's going great.
lt's going great.
l'm on the mend.

19:46.597 --> 19:48.394
l just got some
pins in my legs.

19:48.799 --> 19:52.599
Believe it or not,
pins in my legs,
l can still do this. Right?

19:52.703 --> 19:55.137
l fell off a cruise ship,
but l'm back.

19:55.239 --> 19:56.763
Oh, shit.
Yeah, ''Oh, shit.' '

19:57.375 --> 19:58.501
Yeah, ''Oh, shit.' '

19:59.243 --> 20:03.043
Took a hard,
hard, violent fall.
Kind of pinballed down.

20:03.147 --> 20:05.308
Hit a lot of railings,
broke a lot of shit.

20:05.583 --> 20:08.450
l'm not going to
say l survived,
l'm going to say l thrived.

20:09.020 --> 20:10.544
l met a dolphin down there.

20:10.921 --> 20:13.856
And l swear to God,
that dolphin looked
not at me,

20:13.958 --> 20:15.118
but into my soul.

20:15.226 --> 20:16.887
lnto my goddamn soul, Annie.

20:17.194 --> 20:19.628
And he said,
''l'm saving you, Megan.' '

20:20.064 --> 20:24.296
Not with his mouth,
but he said it,
l'm assuming, telepathically.

20:24.735 --> 20:29.001
We had a connection
that l don't even
know if l can.. . Jesus.

20:30.775 --> 20:33.676
Hey, shut my mouth.
Look at.. . Unbelievable.

20:33.778 --> 20:34.904
You must be Annie's fella.

20:35.646 --> 20:37.170
l'm Megan.
lt's a pleasure.

20:37.715 --> 20:40.343
He's not.. .
l'm not.. . He's not.. .
l'm not with him.

20:40.518 --> 20:41.883
Sorry.
All right.

20:42.553 --> 20:45.181
l'm glad he's single,
because l'm going to
climb that like a tree.

20:46.624 --> 20:49.354
Okay. You have
to meet Helen.

20:49.460 --> 20:51.087
There she is. Helen.

20:54.899 --> 20:56.196
LlLLlAN: Come here!

21:01.138 --> 21:02.435
Helen, this is Annie.

21:02.540 --> 21:03.507
Hi!
Ohh!

21:03.607 --> 21:06.474
There she is.
Maid of honor.

21:06.577 --> 21:09.671
So lovely to meet
Lillian's childhood friend.

21:10.915 --> 21:12.542
You are so pretty.

21:12.950 --> 21:15.680
You are so cute!
You are so sweet.

21:16.353 --> 21:20.756
Helen is married
to Dougie's boss,
Mr. Harris. Perry.

21:20.858 --> 21:22.723
Perry. And they
are so close now,

21:22.827 --> 21:24.522
they are literally
joined at the hip.

21:24.628 --> 21:26.391
Which is good,
because so are we.

21:26.497 --> 21:29.660
l know.
l'm so glad you guys
are finally meeting.

21:29.767 --> 21:31.735

21:32.503 --> 21:34.596
Well, excuse me,
l better go check on
the hors d'oeuvres.

21:34.705 --> 21:36.400
But it was great
to finally meet you.

21:36.741 --> 21:38.208
lt's a great party.

21:38.309 --> 21:39.606
Enjoy.
LlLLlAN: Bye.

21:39.710 --> 21:41.041
Bye.
HELEN: Bye.

21:44.415 --> 21:45.404
She's great, isn't she?

21:45.683 --> 21:47.150
She's awesome.

21:49.186 --> 21:51.848
LlLLlAN'S DAD: <i>And l really</i>
<i>look forward to having</i>
<i>Doug as part of our family.</i>

21:52.256 --> 21:54.156
So much so
that you two should
get married right now

21:54.258 --> 21:55.691
and save me
a shitload of money.

21:56.393 --> 21:57.417
Dad.

21:58.062 --> 22:01.361
Everybody always
laughs at that,
but l'm not joking.

22:03.768 --> 22:04.757
l'm not joking.

22:06.036 --> 22:06.637
Anyway, l want
to thank all of you
for coming.

22:06.637 --> 22:09.504
Anyway, l want
to thank all of you
for coming.

22:09.607 --> 22:12.542
And here's to Doug and
my baby girl, Lillian.

22:12.810 --> 22:14.573
Cheers!
Cheers!

22:14.678 --> 22:16.202
l love you, Dad.
LlLLlAN'S DAD: Enough of me.

22:16.313 --> 22:17.974
Let's get the maid
of honor up here.

22:18.516 --> 22:20.177
All right.
Annie?

22:23.354 --> 22:24.878
Umm. Hi.
l'm Annie Walker.

22:25.222 --> 22:26.348
Yay, Annie!

22:28.893 --> 22:32.829
l'm not going to go
on with a big speech,
so l'll just say this.

22:33.564 --> 22:36.397
l'm so happy to be
a part of this celebration.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.365
And you two
deserve each other,

22:38.536 --> 22:40.401
as well as
a lifetime of happiness.

22:40.504 --> 22:41.835
Thank you.
ANNlE: Cheers.

22:41.939 --> 22:43.600
Love you guys.
GUESTS :Cheers.

Thanks, Annie.
Cheers.

22:47.945 --> 22:50.277
Thank you, Annie.
That was so sweet.
Thank you.

22:50.614 --> 22:54.573
Lil, remember that trip
we took to
Miami with the boys?

22:55.653 --> 22:57.382
And they were
working the entire weekend,

22:57.488 --> 23:00.048
and we just sat
and drank wine
and ate peanut brittle.

23:00.157 --> 23:04.059
And l shared things with you
that l've never
shared with anyone.

23:04.395 --> 23:09.332
And you made me realize
how l can trust people again.

23:09.867 --> 23:11.357
So let me just say,

23:12.403 --> 23:14.701
Lillian,
you are my best friend.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.774
And l'm
so proud of you.

23:19.276 --> 23:22.302
Sorry. And, Dougly.. .

23:22.613 --> 23:24.478
l'm sorry, inside joke.

23:27.585 --> 23:29.382
You better not
keep my Lil on a leash

23:29.486 --> 23:31.351
because l still
need my drunken
Saturday nights

23:31.455 --> 23:33.582
at Rockin' Sushi, okay?

23:35.159 --> 23:39.687
Everybody raise your glasses
to the couple of the decade,

23:40.064 --> 23:41.656
Doug and Lillian.

23:48.205 --> 23:50.469
Have a great night.
Dessert wine is out.

23:50.574 --> 23:53.065
Dessert wine, yummy.
Excuse me.

23:54.278 --> 23:55.245
Umm.. .

23:55.679 --> 23:58.671
l just wanted to
say really quick that

23:58.782 --> 24:02.274
you are so special
to me, because.. .

24:02.386 --> 24:05.321
Well, one of the reasons is
because l've known you
my whole entire life.

24:06.123 --> 24:09.388
And you've really
helped shape who l am.

24:09.727 --> 24:13.823
l just want to thank you
for carefully selecting me

24:13.931 --> 24:15.660
as your maid of honor.

24:15.766 --> 24:18.633
l know you had
some other choices,

24:19.503 --> 24:22.097
but you are like my sister,
and l love you.

24:22.473 --> 24:24.964
Well, that concludes
the speeches for the night.

24:25.342 --> 24:27.071
Thank you.
One last thing.

24:27.177 --> 24:30.442
lt's rare to meet
someone as an adult
who you really connect with,

24:30.547 --> 24:31.605
and that's you, Lil.

24:32.016 --> 24:34.348
l went to Thailand recently
with my husband, Perry,

24:34.451 --> 24:37.784
and there is
a beautiful saying
that l learned there.

24:45.896 --> 24:47.727
lt means,
''You are a part of me,

24:48.332 --> 24:50.323
''a part that l could
never live without,

24:50.434 --> 24:54.234
''and l hope and l pray
that l never have to.' '

25:00.611 --> 25:02.545
And that's it for tonight.
Thank you for coming.

25:02.646 --> 25:03.840
Really quick,
Thank you all for coming.

25:03.948 --> 25:05.540
l just wanted to
say really quick.. .

25:05.716 --> 25:07.308
Dessert wine is out.
Consuelo?

25:07.418 --> 25:08.749
Really quick.
Speaking of Consuelo,

25:08.852 --> 25:13.118
Lillian and l took
Spanish together in school.

25:13.657 --> 25:17.058
And so, l would just
like to say to you,
and to everyone here.. .

25:39.249 --> 25:40.944
Thank you.

25:41.051 --> 25:43.918
Thank you.
l feel so close to you
and can trust you.

25:44.021 --> 25:46.319
You are my
angel and soul mate.

25:46.423 --> 25:51.520
And l feel l can
communicate with you
with simply a look.

25:54.531 --> 25:56.465
Thank you for coming.

25:56.567 --> 25:58.967
Here, l'll take that.
l'll take that.

26:00.571 --> 26:02.095
Yep, l got it.

26:03.540 --> 26:05.167
Lillian.. .

26:14.118 --> 26:16.951
<i>Keep smiling, keep shining</i>

26:17.054 --> 26:21.218
<i>Knowing you can</i>
<i>always count on me</i>

26:21.458 --> 26:22.447
<i>For sure</i>

26:23.560 --> 26:26.290
<i>That's what friends are for</i>

26:26.397 --> 26:27.557
<i>ln good times and bad times</i>

26:27.731 --> 26:28.891
<i>ln good times and bad times</i>

26:28.999 --> 26:31.832
<i>l'll be on your</i>
<i>side forever more</i>

26:32.002 --> 26:34.869
<i>l'll be on your</i>
<i>side forever more</i>

26:34.972 --> 26:36.633
<i>That's what friends are for</i>

26:36.807 --> 26:38.502
<i>That's what</i>
<i>friends are for</i>

26:52.122 --> 26:53.783
LlLLlAN: Man,
engagement parties rule.

26:54.158 --> 26:55.819
lt made me feel awesome,

26:55.926 --> 26:58.588
like l can go out
and catch another
dude to marry.

27:01.598 --> 27:04.431
So, what's up with her,
anyway? With Helen?

27:05.436 --> 27:06.801
What?
l'm just like.. .

27:07.171 --> 27:08.638
l don't know.
She's in your wedding

27:08.739 --> 27:10.866
and you've only
known her eight months,
though, right?

27:11.175 --> 27:12.904
Come on.
Get it out,
get it all out.

27:13.010 --> 27:18.710
l'm just.. .
Like, the whole gown,
and the.. .thing.

27:18.816 --> 27:20.647
lt's just weird, right?
You know what?

27:20.751 --> 27:23.083
She's actually
really cool, Annie.

27:23.187 --> 27:25.485
She's really.. .
She's a good one.
l'm telling you.

27:25.856 --> 27:28.916
Well, l'm sure if you
like her, l will like her.

27:29.460 --> 27:31.485
You have to just
get to know her.

27:31.595 --> 27:33.358
Yeah.
Which l think
you really should.

27:33.464 --> 27:35.295
And.. . Will you
just do me a favor?

27:35.399 --> 27:36.866
Would you just hang
out with her once,

27:37.034 --> 27:38.501
just the two of you.
All right?

27:38.602 --> 27:40.160
As a favor to me.

27:40.270 --> 27:41.396
Okay, l will.

27:42.106 --> 27:43.664
l love you, Annie Lou.
l love you, too.

27:43.774 --> 27:44.763
Bye.
Bye.

27:45.109 --> 27:47.202
Oh. Hi, l'm Helen.

27:47.311 --> 27:50.075
You live in Milwaukee?
l'm sorry.

27:50.347 --> 27:52.713
Have you met Lillian?
She's my best friend.

27:52.816 --> 27:54.647
Yeah, l know.
We've only known each other
for five minutes.

27:54.918 --> 27:56.010
Oh! Oh!

28:00.624 --> 28:02.956
Oh! Cute.

28:03.927 --> 28:06.452
No. No. Come on.

28:11.635 --> 28:15.332
See? Okay?
l'm not drunk. l told you.

28:15.839 --> 28:17.602
So, you are just
a terrible sober driver?

28:18.175 --> 28:20.006
Ha ha. Very funny.
Can l stop walking now?

28:20.110 --> 28:22.010
You can stop walking
when l tell you
to stop walking.

28:22.112 --> 28:23.511
Hey, look.
lf l was drunk,

28:23.614 --> 28:25.241
would l be able to do this?

28:43.500 --> 28:46.230
Stop it. Stop it.
Please, stop.

28:46.336 --> 28:48.031
Please, stop.
l believe you.
You are not drunk.

28:48.539 --> 28:49.870
But l'm still gonna
have to give you a ticket.

28:50.174 --> 28:51.471
What? Why?

28:51.575 --> 28:54.635
lt's a funny thing
about brake lights.
You have to have them.

28:55.012 --> 28:57.776
l knew it.
God, those have
been out for a year.

28:57.981 --> 28:59.573
l'm so stupid.

28:59.683 --> 29:00.911
Look, please.

29:01.685 --> 29:03.277
Please, l promise
l will get them fixed.

29:03.487 --> 29:08.083
This week, l promise.
Please. Do you have
to give me a ticket?

29:10.427 --> 29:12.554
Yes. License
and registration,
please.

29:20.037 --> 29:21.197
Thanks.

29:23.006 --> 29:25.372
Look at that,
you live on
Wynnewood Drive.

29:25.475 --> 29:26.806
Yep.
We are neighbors.

29:27.311 --> 29:29.370
l just live
over on Ashley.
Ahh.

29:31.448 --> 29:32.745
l used to work on Ashley.

29:32.849 --> 29:34.976
You did? Where?

29:35.085 --> 29:39.886
l had a bakery
on the main part
of the street there.

29:41.225 --> 29:42.988
Oh. Cake Baby.

29:45.229 --> 29:46.821
You are Cake Baby!
Yeah!

29:47.231 --> 29:49.893
Yeah, you had your sign.
lt was your face.

29:50.567 --> 29:51.829
Yeah!
That was you?

29:51.935 --> 29:52.924
That was me.

29:54.104 --> 29:55.332
You made good cakes.

29:57.140 --> 29:58.129
Thanks.

29:58.242 --> 30:01.336
You used to make these
little pastry things,

30:01.445 --> 30:05.176
and you'd put
something in them,
like a cream or a custard.. .

30:05.616 --> 30:06.605
Cream puffs.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.981
Cream puffs,
that's what you call them.
Delicious.

30:10.120 --> 30:13.681
l used to get served
by this tall, broad guy,

30:13.790 --> 30:15.280
with, like, a wormy face.

30:15.959 --> 30:18.086
Yeah, that was my boyfriend.

30:20.163 --> 30:21.653
Sorry.
No, no. lt was.. .

30:21.765 --> 30:25.030
He was my boyfriend,
and then he left me

30:25.135 --> 30:28.764
when the business
went under. So, anyway.. .

30:28.872 --> 30:30.362
You're kidding?

30:31.742 --> 30:33.107
What a dick.

30:34.344 --> 30:36.278
l'm glad
l never tipped him.

30:41.685 --> 30:42.777
You know what?
Let's forget about this.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.585
Let's just
forget this one.
Really?

30:45.689 --> 30:47.316
Under one condition.
What? What?

30:47.424 --> 30:48.516
Get your
taillights fixed.. .

30:48.625 --> 30:50.490
l promise.
l promise l will.
l promise. Thank you.

30:50.594 --> 30:51.686
...before you kill someone.

30:51.862 --> 30:52.954
l'm not going to
kill anybody.

30:53.063 --> 30:54.496
All right.
Here, there's your lD.

30:54.665 --> 30:56.098
And l'm going
to give you this.

30:56.199 --> 30:58.793
lt's a buddy of mine.
He has a body
shop in Milwaukee.

30:58.902 --> 31:00.563
He'll fix those
right up for you.

31:01.371 --> 31:03.032
Bill Cozbi?

31:03.307 --> 31:04.569
Yeah, with a ''Z.' '

31:05.108 --> 31:06.837
Different guy.
Yeah.

31:06.943 --> 31:09.309
And don't mention
the whole ''Bill
Cosby'' thing to him.

31:09.413 --> 31:11.813
lt drives him nuts.
l mean it.

31:11.915 --> 31:14.213
Okay, l get it. Thanks.

31:14.318 --> 31:17.116
You know what?
lf you mention my name,
that l referred you,

31:17.220 --> 31:19.017
he'll give you
a particularly
good deal.

31:19.122 --> 31:21.249
My gosh. Thank you.

31:21.358 --> 31:23.553
l really appreciate it.
Thanks.

31:23.660 --> 31:26.254
Okay. Well,
l appreciated your cakes.

31:26.363 --> 31:28.126
So, we are even.

31:28.231 --> 31:30.358
That's me, there.
Rhodes. Officer Rhodes.

31:30.467 --> 31:31.593
That's really
nice of you.

31:35.806 --> 31:37.467
Thank you.

31:37.574 --> 31:39.064
We are not all bad.

31:39.176 --> 31:40.404
What?

31:40.510 --> 31:41.875
l was just saying,
we are not all bad!

31:42.145 --> 31:43.544
Oh. Yeah.

31:43.647 --> 31:46.309
Actually, the rest of
them are, but not me.

31:46.416 --> 31:47.906
l'm the best of them.

31:48.185 --> 31:49.311
Okay. Thank you.

31:50.087 --> 31:51.247
Anyway.

31:51.755 --> 31:52.744
Thank you.

33:42.466 --> 33:43.831
l didn't know
you played tennis.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.799
Yeah, l played
a little in
high school.

33:46.069 --> 33:47.696
l'm so glad we
were able to do this.

33:47.971 --> 33:50.166
l'm really glad we
could do this, too.
lt's nice we get to hang out.

33:50.273 --> 33:51.467
l know, right?
Yeah.

33:51.575 --> 33:53.440
lt's too bad
Lillian couldn't play
with us today.

33:53.543 --> 33:54.669
Poor thing, she is so busy.

33:54.845 --> 33:56.005
Ohh. l know.

33:56.213 --> 33:58.807
But she's not really
that into sports.

33:59.082 --> 34:00.447
Even when we were little,
she didn't like anything

34:00.550 --> 34:01.915
that was too competitive.

34:02.118 --> 34:05.019
She certainly enjoys
playing tennis now.

34:05.121 --> 34:06.816
lt's funny how
people change, isn't it?

34:07.224 --> 34:10.193
Yeah. l mean, l don't know.
Do people really change?

34:10.860 --> 34:11.850
l think they do.

34:12.161 --> 34:15.222
Yeah, but, l mean,
they still stay
who they are, pretty much.

34:15.599 --> 34:17.862
l think we change
all the time.

34:18.368 --> 34:22.429
l think we stay the same,
but grow,
l guess, a little bit.

34:22.739 --> 34:24.969
l think if you are growing,
then you are changing.

34:25.074 --> 34:28.408
But, l mean, we are changing
from who we are,
which we always stay as.

34:28.512 --> 34:30.002
Not really,
l don't think so.

34:30.179 --> 34:31.704
l think so.
l don't.

34:33.016 --> 34:34.505
Annie! These are my kids.

34:34.618 --> 34:36.415
Step-kids.
Step.

34:38.621 --> 34:39.610
They are so hilarious.

34:39.789 --> 34:40.813
Funny.

34:40.924 --> 34:43.654
Excuse me,
my husband's kids.

34:44.060 --> 34:45.152
HELEN: What are
you guys up to?

34:45.328 --> 34:46.420
Going to the snack bar.

34:46.530 --> 34:48.395
Awesome. You need
a ride home later?

34:48.697 --> 34:50.130
Fuck off, Helen.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.763
Okay. Put a quarter
in the swear-jar.

34:54.271 --> 34:56.569
Good to see you.

34:56.672 --> 34:57.662
They are so cute.

34:57.841 --> 34:58.865
Sweet kids.

35:31.074 --> 35:32.098
Carol!

35:32.342 --> 35:33.969
Get your shit together, Carol!

35:46.856 --> 35:47.880
Yes!

35:50.427 --> 35:53.863
l've seen better
tennis playing in
a tampon commercial.

35:58.368 --> 35:59.335
Umm.. .

35:59.869 --> 36:01.700
l've been thinking, and.. .

36:01.972 --> 36:04.566
Brynn needs to start
paying rent. That's it.

36:04.674 --> 36:05.971
She's been here
long enough.

36:06.076 --> 36:08.977
The three of us live here,
it's not fair for
me to be paying half.

36:09.179 --> 36:11.647
We split it three ways.
What do you say?

36:11.748 --> 36:14.216
Well, she can't work.
She's on a tourist visa.

36:14.317 --> 36:16.945
Yeah. So, technically,
l'm only allowed to tour.

36:17.053 --> 36:18.315
Well, you know.. .

36:18.488 --> 36:19.750
l have no way
of earning money,

36:19.856 --> 36:22.484
unless l just
go and prostitute
down on the street.

36:22.592 --> 36:24.287
l don't want you
to do that, no.

36:24.461 --> 36:26.156
''Hello, fellas.
Here l am.' '

36:26.262 --> 36:27.661
Yeah, but we.. .
''Put your American sausage

36:27.764 --> 36:29.231
''in my English McMuffin.' '

36:29.332 --> 36:30.424
No, we did that.
All right.

36:30.533 --> 36:32.865
Okay, l don't even know
what you're
talking about anymore.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.832
There's three
people living here.
Yeah.

36:34.938 --> 36:36.803
lf she doesn't
start paying.. .

36:36.940 --> 36:38.032
BRYNN: l'm not.
...she has to leave.

36:38.408 --> 36:39.898
ls this about
the diary again?

36:40.010 --> 36:41.068
What diary?

36:41.344 --> 36:44.006
Your diary proved
very interesting to read.

36:44.314 --> 36:46.179
You read my.. .
You read my journal?

36:46.282 --> 36:49.445
At first, l did not know
that it was your diary.

36:49.552 --> 36:52.578
l thought it was
a very sad,
hand-written book.

36:53.890 --> 36:55.551
What? That does not
make any.. .

36:55.725 --> 36:57.386
But, because of
the deep personal details

36:57.494 --> 36:59.928
and the bits that
mentioned Gil and Brynn.. .
ANNlE: No, no, no, no.

37:00.096 --> 37:01.723
Don't read my journal!
GlL: And the crumbs.

37:01.831 --> 37:03.059
Then.. .
Don't go in my room!

37:03.166 --> 37:07.262
Well, hello! l think,
before you make
those sort of demands,

37:07.370 --> 37:08.667
you need to,
maybe, think about

37:08.838 --> 37:10.135
putting a note on
your door saying,

37:10.273 --> 37:13.504
''Do not come into my room,
read my diary and
wear my clothes.' '

37:24.454 --> 37:26.547
BECCA: Wow, l've never been
to this part of town before.

37:27.090 --> 37:29.081
Look, you can get
your checks cashed
next door.

37:29.192 --> 37:30.625
l know it looks
a little scary
on the outside,

37:30.727 --> 37:33.025
but the food
is really good,
authentic Brazilian.

37:33.363 --> 37:35.593
ANNlE: l'm telling you,
this is where
Brazilians come to eat.

37:35.699 --> 37:37.030
l got to say, Annie's
really good at this.

37:37.133 --> 37:38.760
She always drags me
to the weirdest places

37:38.935 --> 37:40.596
and the food is
always incredible.

37:40.704 --> 37:42.399
And plus, you get
a lot for your money, too.
So that's good.

37:44.015 --> 37:44.982
All right.
Let's do it.

37:45.082 --> 37:46.777
Let's do it.

37:46.884 --> 37:48.818
Somebody likes
Brazilian food.

37:53.491 --> 37:54.617
To my bridesmaids.

37:54.725 --> 37:56.454
Cheers.
ALL: Cheers.

37:57.228 --> 37:58.661
Cheers to Lil!

37:58.763 --> 38:02.756
This is such a stone-cold
pack of weirdos,
and l'm so proud.

38:02.867 --> 38:05.062
And l just want to toast
all of you ladies.

38:05.169 --> 38:06.727
l'm so happy to
get to know you guys,

38:06.837 --> 38:09.738
and happy to say
that l have four
new friends.

38:10.107 --> 38:11.597
Absolutely. Cheers.

38:12.910 --> 38:15.640
So, Annie,
do you have a date
for the wedding?

38:15.813 --> 38:16.780
Um.. .

38:18.115 --> 38:21.551
l don't.. . l don't think
l'm bringing anybody,
l guess.

38:21.686 --> 38:23.916
Please, can l
set you up? Please?

38:24.055 --> 38:26.489
Annie, you can't go
to the wedding alone.
Please?

38:26.590 --> 38:28.717
lf you go alone,
people might think
you're a prostitute.

38:28.826 --> 38:29.952
Maybe.

38:31.362 --> 38:32.386
l'm sorry.

38:34.365 --> 38:39.132
l hope that you're all hungry
for <i>churrasco Brasil.</i>
What would you like?

38:39.503 --> 38:40.800
Yeah, l'll have
some of that, please.

38:40.905 --> 38:41.963
l'll start with this.

38:42.073 --> 38:44.541
l'd say yes.
Hello, chicken.

38:44.642 --> 38:46.405
This is crazy
good, ya'll.

38:46.911 --> 38:48.378
Helen, aren't you
eating any meat?

38:49.714 --> 38:52.877
lt's not good
to eat a big meal
before a fitting.

38:52.983 --> 38:54.314
l feel a bit
bloated, so.. .

38:54.418 --> 38:55.407
Not me.

38:55.519 --> 38:57.714
HELEN: No?
No. Physically,
l don't bloat.

38:58.656 --> 38:59.953
Lucky.
That is lucky.

39:00.791 --> 39:02.019
lt's a gift.

39:02.226 --> 39:05.889
l can't wait to be married
for as long as you've been
married.

39:05.996 --> 39:07.122
And to have kids.

39:10.367 --> 39:11.959
And be a mom.
Becca?

39:12.069 --> 39:14.128
Yeah?

39:14.238 --> 39:16.399
The other night,
l'm slaving away,

39:16.507 --> 39:18.600
making a beautiful
dinner for my family.

39:19.043 --> 39:22.069
My youngest boy
comes in and says
he wants to order a pizza.

39:22.346 --> 39:24.007
l said, ''No, we're not
ordering pizza tonight.' '

39:24.115 --> 39:26.583
He goes,
''Mom, why don't you go
and fuck yourself?''

39:27.118 --> 39:28.415
He's nine.

39:30.087 --> 39:31.418
Okay, now that Lillian's
in the bathroom,

39:31.522 --> 39:33.854
l just wanted to
talk to you guys
about the shower really quick.

39:33.958 --> 39:37.359
l was thinking
it could be French-themed,

39:37.461 --> 39:38.951
since she's always
wanted to go to Paris
her whole life.

39:41.146 --> 39:44.138
So l figured we
could bring Paris here

39:44.316 --> 39:47.308
and have champagne
and little cookies.

39:47.419 --> 39:48.886
They'd say ''Lillian
and Dougie'' on them.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.544
We can dip them in
chocolate fondue,

39:50.656 --> 39:53.284
and get cheese from
the nice part of the store.

39:53.726 --> 39:55.193
l love that.
Good idea, Annie.

39:55.294 --> 39:57.285
We can have
French invitations,
the whole thing.

39:57.396 --> 39:58.488
Don't you think
that'd be nice?

39:58.597 --> 40:00.565
That's adorable!
That's really cute.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.327
Good. Great.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.095
l don't know.
lt's really cute.

40:04.203 --> 40:06.171
But l feel like,
personally, the Paris theme's

40:06.338 --> 40:08.329
a bit,
''Been there, done that.' '

40:08.540 --> 40:09.802
l just feel
like we can top it.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.239
We should throw
some ideas around.

40:11.343 --> 40:13.538
See if anyone else
has a theme they had in mind

40:13.645 --> 40:15.169
or something
they'd been thinking of.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.512
What about
a Pixar-themed shower?

40:18.350 --> 40:20.477
And we all come dressed
as our favorite
Pixar character.

40:20.686 --> 40:24.952
That, and l'll just
snowball on top of that,
also <i>Fight Club.</i>

40:26.658 --> 40:27.682
Female fight club.

40:28.861 --> 40:30.761
We grease up,
we pull in.

40:30.863 --> 40:34.492
Lillian doesn't know,
so it's, ''Surprise!
We're going to fight!''

40:34.700 --> 40:36.258
We beat the shit out of her.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.626
She's not going
to forget that.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.768
We just fucking attack.

40:41.273 --> 40:43.036
Can l be honest?
No.

40:43.142 --> 40:46.305
l'm at home with
three boys all day,
every day.

40:46.412 --> 40:47.709
What about
the bachelorette party?

40:48.080 --> 40:49.206
That's what's more important.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.809
l've got a new tube top,
l want to cut the tags off.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.817
l'd like to take
advantage of this opportunity.

40:54.353 --> 40:56.150
Where are we going?
MEGAN: l'm going
to second her.

40:56.255 --> 40:57.847
We'd better
blow this shit out.
Yeah.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.584
That poor girl, Lillian,
who we're all here for,

41:00.692 --> 41:03.058
is in the bathroom
probably bawling her
fucking eyes out.

41:03.362 --> 41:05.227
Because she's realizing,
''Holy shit!

41:05.330 --> 41:07.059
''l've got to spend
the rest of my life
with Doug.' '

41:07.166 --> 41:10.294
He's my brother. l love him.
But he is a fucking asshole.

41:10.402 --> 41:12.097
l think we can all
agree on that, right?

41:13.705 --> 41:15.536
We can.. .
We'll figure it out.

41:15.641 --> 41:18.075
l mean, l can think of stuff,
and it will be great.

41:18.177 --> 41:20.372
We just have to make sure
it's really, really special.

41:24.249 --> 41:28.015
Belle en Blanc?
This is the place.
Great job, Annie.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.747
Thanks.
Annie.

41:32.424 --> 41:34.221
<i>Belle en Blanc.</i>
<i>Reservation name?</i>

41:34.326 --> 41:38.160
l don't have one.
We're just here to shop,
just to try on some dresses.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.890
<i>Okay. Well, the next</i>
<i>available appointment</i>

41:40.065 --> 41:41.692
<i>for bridesmaids'</i>
<i>fittings is in seven weeks.</i>

41:41.800 --> 41:43.597
<i>Absolutely no walk-ins.</i>

41:43.735 --> 41:45.498
Whitney? lt's Helen.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.262
<i>Helen Harris?</i>
Yeah!

41:47.372 --> 41:48.396
<i>Hi!</i>
Hi.

41:48.507 --> 41:50.372
<i>Oh, my God. Hi. Listen,</i>
<i>l'll buzz you right in.</i>

41:50.476 --> 41:52.239
Great, thanks.
<i>Okay.</i>

41:53.679 --> 41:56.113
Hello. Welcome, come in.

41:56.215 --> 41:57.307
You look wonderful.
Great to see you.

41:57.416 --> 41:59.350
Welcome to Belle
en Blanc, ladies.

41:59.451 --> 42:01.214
Welcome to heaven.
LlLLlAN: Thank you.

42:01.320 --> 42:02.617
MEGAN: Oh, man!

42:03.489 --> 42:06.617
This is some
classy shit here.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.386
Jesus, Megan!

42:08.494 --> 42:09.961
l'm sorry,
l want to apologize.

42:10.062 --> 42:13.327
l'm not even confident
on which end that came out of.

42:13.432 --> 42:15.457
Whitney, back to you.
l'm sorry.

42:15.567 --> 42:18.593
Anyway, take a look around.
Get to know the dresses.

42:19.004 --> 42:20.403
lf you need anything,
l'll be in my office.

42:20.939 --> 42:21.997
Have fun.

42:22.107 --> 42:24.905
Oh, my God.

42:25.410 --> 42:26.775
lt's a Fritz Bernaise.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.037
Ladies, l.. .
Oh, my God!

42:28.147 --> 42:30.547
l just don't think
we can do any better.
This is.. .

42:30.649 --> 42:32.583
This is beautiful.
That is gorgeous.

42:32.684 --> 42:34.379
lt's unique,
it's special, it's couture.

42:34.486 --> 42:36.181
This is made in France.

42:36.355 --> 42:38.084
Helen, this is $800.

42:38.190 --> 42:39.953
Are you kidding?
lt's on sale.

42:40.125 --> 42:42.150
LlLLlAN: Are you serious?
Oh, my gosh.
What a perfect combination.

42:42.261 --> 42:43.660
HELEN: You guys,
it was meant to be.

42:43.762 --> 42:45.127
Oh. That's nice.

42:45.797 --> 42:49.358
There's other dresses
we should be looking at.

42:49.468 --> 42:51.163
Nope, not that one.

42:52.871 --> 42:54.805
Lillian,
Lillian, look at this one.

42:54.907 --> 42:56.431
lsn't this pretty?
Yeah.

42:56.542 --> 42:58.703
lt's really pretty
and sweet, and.. .

42:58.810 --> 43:02.974
We don't want to
upstage Lillian
with a big fancy dress.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.605
Maybe we should
just get something
kind of simple.

43:04.783 --> 43:05.750
Oh.

43:06.051 --> 43:09.316
Please do not worry
about upstaging me.

43:09.421 --> 43:12.390
Because guess who
Helen is friends with

43:12.558 --> 43:15.550
and who's
designing my wedding dress.

43:15.661 --> 43:18.425
Lady St. Petsois JuJu.

43:19.431 --> 43:21.296
l just sent my
measurements to France, y'all.

43:21.466 --> 43:23.366
RlTA: No, you didn't.

43:23.468 --> 43:24.958
Where were you when l
was getting married?

43:25.070 --> 43:28.096
Ladies, let's not decide
on this bridesmaids'
dress straight away.

43:28.207 --> 43:29.538
Let's let
our bodies decide.

43:29.908 --> 43:32.206
Try some things on
and have some fun, okay?

43:32.611 --> 43:34.476
Yeah, let's have
some fun, girls.

43:34.646 --> 43:36.546
Ladies,
start your ''engines.' '

43:37.316 --> 43:38.806
RlTA: Oh, yeah.
BECCA: Lil, Lil.

43:38.917 --> 43:41.715
LlLLlAN: Amazing.
This is so cool.

43:51.230 --> 43:54.131
Ladies. Ladies,
if l may interject.

43:54.233 --> 43:56.633
l just want to say
you all look stunning.

43:56.835 --> 43:58.496
That's a given. Head to toe.

43:58.604 --> 44:01.539
But, sadly,
we need to agree on one.

44:01.673 --> 44:04.039
Well, l mean, ladies,
you all look beautiful.

44:04.142 --> 44:07.703
But l just think,
personally, the
Fritz Bernaise is just.. .

44:07.846 --> 44:09.143
l mean.. .
lt's a Bernaise.

44:09.248 --> 44:11.648
HELEN: This is
one of a kind.
l just.. .

44:11.783 --> 44:12.750
l don't think
there is a question.

44:12.884 --> 44:13.851
No. No question.

44:14.786 --> 44:16.253
There might be a question.

44:16.722 --> 44:18.155
l might.. .
l might have a question.

44:18.257 --> 44:20.054
l think this
dress would look great
on everybody.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.217
lt's a great color.
lt's a great length.

44:22.327 --> 44:24.761
lt's fun. You can twirl.

44:24.863 --> 44:26.888
You can move in it.

44:26.999 --> 44:28.660
You can spread
your legs apart.

44:28.767 --> 44:31.065
And it's a great price.

44:31.937 --> 44:33.928
This is designer as well.

44:34.306 --> 44:35.534
ls anyone else hot?

44:35.707 --> 44:36.935
lt is like an
oven in here.

44:37.476 --> 44:40.172
Okay, well,
maybe this might
help you decide.

44:40.279 --> 44:42.008
While you gals were
in the changing room,

44:42.147 --> 44:46.481
l happened to rustle up
a two-year-old Lady
JuJu dress in storage.

44:46.585 --> 44:48.246
l had Lillian put it
on so you could see

44:48.420 --> 44:50.081
what you'll be
standing next to.

44:50.188 --> 44:51.621
Lillian, honey.

44:51.723 --> 44:53.350
My God.

44:55.627 --> 44:56.958
Beautiful length.

44:57.129 --> 44:58.494
Breathtaking.

44:58.597 --> 45:02.294
Holy shit!
You look amazing.

45:02.434 --> 45:03.901
That's a dress.
That dress is so pretty

45:04.002 --> 45:04.969
it makes my stomach hurt.

45:07.105 --> 45:08.800
Lillian,

45:08.974 --> 45:11.534
l don't know what to say.
You look.. .

45:13.712 --> 45:14.701
Megan, are you okay?

45:18.950 --> 45:19.939
MEGAN: l think.. .

45:21.787 --> 45:23.277
My dress was
probably just tight.

45:23.388 --> 45:24.685
Oh, my God.

45:24.790 --> 45:27.054
You got food poisoning
from that restaurant,
didn't you?

45:27.392 --> 45:30.623
No, l had the same thing
that she had and l feel fine.

45:30.962 --> 45:32.327
Oh, my.. . Okay.
Oh, no.

45:32.564 --> 45:34.031
Why is this happening?
Nothing is happening.

45:35.300 --> 45:36.460
Oh, my God.

45:37.135 --> 45:38.898
RlTA: l don't really care
which dress we get.

45:39.004 --> 45:41.063
lt doesn't matter to me.
l just need to get
off this white carpet.

45:41.173 --> 45:42.606
Oh, God.
Okay. No,
not the bathroom.

45:42.708 --> 45:45.404
Everybody go outside.
l'm serious!

45:45.510 --> 45:47.410
There is a bathroom
across the street.

45:49.648 --> 45:51.843
l think everybody
has the flu.

45:54.519 --> 45:55.577
Shit!

45:56.988 --> 45:59.149
l need the toilet!
l need the toilet!

46:00.992 --> 46:02.892
l need the toilet!

46:02.994 --> 46:04.461
No!

46:05.530 --> 46:08.260
No. No, Megan.
No! No!

46:08.367 --> 46:10.028
Look away!
Megan, no!

46:10.168 --> 46:11.226
Look away!

46:16.208 --> 46:18.836
You don't look
very well, Annie.

46:20.078 --> 46:21.067
l feel fine.

46:21.446 --> 46:25.280
Are you sure?
lt wasn't that
gray kind of lamb?

46:25.384 --> 46:27.113
You ate a lot of
that weird chicken.

46:27.552 --> 46:29.076
Was it that?

46:29.221 --> 46:31.451
No. l'm.. .

46:31.556 --> 46:32.682
l.. . l feel fine.

46:33.925 --> 46:36.655
l think you'd just feel
better if you threw up.

46:39.030 --> 46:40.691
l don't have.. .
l don't have to throw up.

46:43.435 --> 46:44.424
l am so sorry.

46:44.536 --> 46:45.503
Get away from me!

46:46.471 --> 46:47.460
You're not sick?

46:47.572 --> 46:48.561
No.
No?

46:48.673 --> 46:51.733
ln fact, Helen, l'm hungry.

46:51.843 --> 46:53.970
And l wish l had a snack.

46:54.212 --> 46:55.201
You're hungry?

46:56.248 --> 46:57.681
l'm starving.

46:59.184 --> 47:00.242
What did we eat?

47:01.620 --> 47:03.485
The sink is a goner.
What are you doing?

47:03.622 --> 47:05.214
lt's coming out
of me like lava!

47:06.158 --> 47:07.489
Oh, my God.

47:07.659 --> 47:08.990
Don't you
fucking look at me!

47:11.430 --> 47:12.397
Hmm?

47:12.931 --> 47:13.898
Jordan almonds.

47:14.366 --> 47:15.333
These are great.

47:16.134 --> 47:17.431
Thank you.

47:27.979 --> 47:29.139
Better?

47:30.348 --> 47:31.576
l was.. .
l was just hungry.

47:31.750 --> 47:32.978
Yeah.

47:34.319 --> 47:36.651
Annie, everybody
is really sick
from that restaurant.

47:38.423 --> 47:39.981
But it wasn't
the restaurant.
No, no, no, no.

47:40.091 --> 47:41.490
Lillian,
where are you going?
No.

47:41.593 --> 47:42.617
l need a bathroom.

47:43.662 --> 47:44.651
Lil!

47:44.763 --> 47:45.730
No. No.

47:45.831 --> 47:46.855
Lil, where are you going?

47:47.966 --> 47:49.627
HELEN: Be careful.
What are you doing?

47:50.635 --> 47:52.262
lt's happening.
lt's happening.

47:52.437 --> 47:54.098
lt's happening.
lt's happening.

47:57.309 --> 47:59.004
lt happened.
ANNlE: What are you doing?

47:59.110 --> 48:00.475
lt happened.

48:01.646 --> 48:04.171
No. Don't you
dare ruin that dress!

48:05.183 --> 48:06.673
Ohh. You're really
doing it, aren't you?

48:06.852 --> 48:08.376
You're really
shitting in the street.

48:18.763 --> 48:20.492
We'll just take five
of the Fritz Bernaises.

48:20.599 --> 48:22.191
Thank you, Whitney.
They really do look better.

48:22.300 --> 48:23.790
Right.
Thank you.

48:28.072 --> 48:29.369
You okay?

48:31.342 --> 48:34.368
l crapped
my wedding dress.
l crapped.. .

48:34.478 --> 48:38.141
l.. . l crapped
my wedding dress.

48:40.217 --> 48:42.276
Lunch was fun,
though, right?

48:43.454 --> 48:45.046
lt was a good time,
all the girls together.

48:45.156 --> 48:47.021
ls this a sign, Annie?

48:47.391 --> 48:48.449
No. l'm just
going to pull over

48:48.559 --> 48:50.322
really quick,
though, because.. .

48:50.461 --> 48:51.428
What?

48:51.529 --> 48:52.621
...my tire just
feels a little.. .

48:52.730 --> 48:53.788
Where are you going?

48:53.898 --> 48:54.990
My tire just feels
a little low.

48:55.099 --> 48:56.964
l just want to check
my tire real quick.

49:23.994 --> 49:26.724
Oh. Could l borrow
your razor, please?

49:30.734 --> 49:32.201
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

49:32.436 --> 49:33.630
Have a good date.
Thank you.

49:33.771 --> 49:37.036
ls the guy that
you're going out
with also over 40?

49:37.208 --> 49:39.108
l'm not over 40.
Forget it.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.835
Lift up your arm.
Point up.

49:43.948 --> 49:45.381
Ow!
Sorry.

49:56.127 --> 49:57.492
Hi.
Annie.

49:57.828 --> 49:59.295
Pete?
Yeah.

49:59.430 --> 50:00.419
Come on in.

50:00.531 --> 50:01.498
All right. Thank you.

50:04.702 --> 50:06.863
Oh. This is
my son, Tyler.

50:07.204 --> 50:09.035
Hi, Tyler.
Hi.

50:10.107 --> 50:11.870
These things are
always so awkward.
Yeah.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.840
l'm not really a setup guy.
Me, either.

50:13.944 --> 50:15.468
But Becca spoke
so highly of you.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.305
She had a lot of
really nice things
to say about you, too.

50:18.415 --> 50:19.473
That's nice to hear.

50:19.650 --> 50:22.244
l'm going to go upstairs,
throw on a couple
of finishing touches.

50:23.387 --> 50:26.254
The babysitter's not here yet,
so just hang out with Tyler

50:26.357 --> 50:27.517
and l'll be
right back down.
Okay.

50:27.625 --> 50:28.592
Okay.

50:39.770 --> 50:41.533
So, how old are you?

50:45.743 --> 50:47.404
Do you watch movies?

50:53.551 --> 50:55.849
Are you afraid of dying?

50:55.953 --> 50:56.920
Hmm?

50:57.021 --> 50:59.251
Are you afraid of dying?

51:00.024 --> 51:00.991
Um.. .

51:02.326 --> 51:04.157
l don't know.

51:04.361 --> 51:09.025
l mean,
l guess everybody is.
l don't know. Why?

51:09.700 --> 51:12.134
Because my mom is
going to kill you.

51:22.780 --> 51:24.839
You're making me
uncomfortable.

51:29.853 --> 51:32.617
Your hair looks burned.

51:34.858 --> 51:35.825
Okay.

51:37.428 --> 51:40.659
Are you going to make
a baby with my father?

51:42.666 --> 51:44.634
l don't.. .
l don't know.

51:45.169 --> 51:47.933
My grandma died
where you're sitting.

51:49.273 --> 51:50.672
She died right here?

51:52.042 --> 51:54.340
Right where your
underpants are.

52:02.052 --> 52:03.679
You wanna
watch me dance?

52:05.289 --> 52:06.256
Sure.

52:26.710 --> 52:28.439
PETE: l can't do this.

52:28.912 --> 52:31.904
Listen to me.
l miss you so much.

52:32.283 --> 52:34.183
l'll come over right now.

52:34.285 --> 52:36.412
Okay, l'm not over
you yet, that's why.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.112
She's not even pretty.

52:39.023 --> 52:41.491
l'm not doing it.
l can't. No.

52:49.433 --> 52:51.731
What are you doing?
Did you eat one of those?

52:51.835 --> 52:53.860
Did you eat
one of those?

52:54.004 --> 52:55.665
l ate Saturday.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.134
Okay. Oh, boy.
You know what?

52:58.242 --> 53:00.836
Something's going
to happen to you.
l don't know what it is,

53:00.944 --> 53:03.845
but something's
going to happen
to your body.

53:08.252 --> 53:10.083
That was fun.
Oh, my gosh.

53:12.056 --> 53:15.423
You know what
l was thinking?

53:15.526 --> 53:18.256
You should come with me
to Lillian's wedding, maybe.

53:18.762 --> 53:20.696
Not like that.
Not like anything serious.

53:20.798 --> 53:22.595
But just like
a fun time, you know?

53:22.733 --> 53:27.261
We can get dressed up,
and we can go dancing
and have a drink.

53:27.371 --> 53:28.633
lt'll be fun, right?

53:29.239 --> 53:32.037
No. l mean, l don't want to
make you have to explain

53:32.142 --> 53:34.906
to all those people
what our relationship is.

53:35.346 --> 53:38.804
That would suck
for you. Right?

53:39.817 --> 53:41.114
Yeah. l guess so.

53:41.518 --> 53:43.145
l'm just thinking of you.
Yeah.

53:43.253 --> 53:45.778
No, it's okay.

53:45.889 --> 53:49.154
l have someone else
l can ask, anyway. So.. .

53:49.993 --> 53:51.585
Really?
Yeah.

53:53.379 --> 53:54.038
Who?

53:54.146 --> 53:55.340
Umm.. .
This guy, George.

53:56.682 --> 53:58.309
George Glass.

54:01.720 --> 54:02.778
Okay.

54:04.390 --> 54:06.858
Who is this George?

54:07.593 --> 54:11.495
He is a very hot, nice guy

54:11.630 --> 54:15.088
who likes me a lot,
and would probably
love to be my date.

54:15.200 --> 54:16.189
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

54:16.302 --> 54:17.269
Mmm-hmm.

54:22.141 --> 54:24.200
Well, let me ask you this.

54:24.310 --> 54:28.144
Can this George Glass

54:29.748 --> 54:32.114
do this to you?

54:42.995 --> 54:44.257
Probably.

54:45.097 --> 54:47.895
You know what?
lt's getting really late.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.401
You should probably go.
l'm going to miss you so much.

55:11.490 --> 55:12.457
Oh.

55:15.661 --> 55:16.650
Annie Walker.

55:16.829 --> 55:17.818
Hi.

55:17.930 --> 55:19.124
Hey.
Hey.

55:19.431 --> 55:21.661
What brings you
in here so early?

55:21.767 --> 55:24.827
l've just had a bad night.
Boy stuff.
Ohh.

55:26.038 --> 55:27.562
Do you want me
to arrest anybody?

55:27.673 --> 55:28.640
l could do that.

55:28.807 --> 55:29.774
Actually.. . No.

55:30.142 --> 55:33.236
Do you want to talk
to a cop about it?
We are just like priests.

55:34.947 --> 55:37.040
Except we can
tell everybody
about it afterwards.

55:37.149 --> 55:38.138
Oh.
l won't, though.

55:38.684 --> 55:39.878
Doesn't sound very inviting.

55:41.553 --> 55:42.679
You want a carrot?

55:44.656 --> 55:45.918
Right now?
Yeah.

55:46.525 --> 55:48.686
l'll share.
l've got plenty.

55:49.728 --> 55:50.786
Sure, l'll have a carrot.

55:50.963 --> 55:52.021
Yeah?

55:52.131 --> 55:53.325
Okay.

55:54.033 --> 55:55.967
Ohh. Yeah,
that sounds rough.

55:57.336 --> 55:58.394
lt's going to
get better, right?

55:58.504 --> 55:59.493
l wouldn't have
thought so.

55:59.605 --> 56:02.597
You know, my sister
was a maid of honor
at our cousin's wedding,

56:02.708 --> 56:06.269
and she found it so stressful,
her hair started falling out.

56:06.545 --> 56:08.274
That's terrible.
Yeah.

56:08.380 --> 56:10.473
lt grew back,
but it was.. .

56:11.016 --> 56:12.483
lt was pretty gross.

56:13.052 --> 56:14.383
Planning a wedding
should be fun.

56:14.486 --> 56:17.114
You know what?
lf l ever had a wedding,

56:17.289 --> 56:19.917
l'd want everybody
to be stress-free.

56:20.025 --> 56:21.720
l'd like it to be
like a carnival.

56:22.194 --> 56:26.255
Like, people win prizes
for guessing
the bride's weight.

56:26.365 --> 56:27.696
Dunk tanks.

56:27.800 --> 56:28.858
Yeah.
You know?

56:29.601 --> 56:30.625
Mmm-hmm.
You could have elephants,

56:30.736 --> 56:33.068
and the bride and groom
can walk on
a little tightrope.

56:33.172 --> 56:35.970
Okay, what you are
talking about there,
that's a circus wedding.

56:36.075 --> 56:37.702
lt's a totally different.. .
Right.

56:37.810 --> 56:39.175
You missed it.
Yeah.

56:40.079 --> 56:43.139
Hey, you know,
instead of stressing
out about this wedding,

56:43.248 --> 56:45.808
you know what you
should be doing?

56:45.918 --> 56:47.852
Setting up a new bakery!

56:48.720 --> 56:49.687
Hmm.

56:50.989 --> 56:52.320
No, l'm kind of
done with that.

56:52.991 --> 56:53.980
What?

56:54.693 --> 56:56.524
l don't do it anymore.

56:56.895 --> 56:58.192
All right.

57:00.499 --> 57:02.194
Ew.
Oh!

57:02.501 --> 57:03.798
You got the ugly carrot.
What?

57:04.536 --> 57:06.527
There is one in every bag.
You have to eat it.
lt's good luck.

57:06.638 --> 57:07.696
l'm not eating this.

57:07.873 --> 57:08.931
Yeah! l'll eat it.

57:09.108 --> 57:11.406
lt's the lucky carrot?
No, don't eat it!
Don't eat it. Don't eat it!

57:12.444 --> 57:16.608
Well, don't litter!
l'll fine you.
l'm sorry.

57:17.116 --> 57:18.640
You know what?
Actually,
l'm going to pick it up.

57:18.750 --> 57:20.012
lt really bothers me.
Sorry.

57:20.119 --> 57:24.283
l'm sorry.
lt's just that l'm anal
about that kind of thing.

57:27.860 --> 57:32.797
l didn't know that
you could be a cop here
if you weren't a citizen.

57:33.732 --> 57:34.790
You can't.
No?

57:34.900 --> 57:36.731
No. No, you can't.

57:36.835 --> 57:38.700
But they made
a special dispensation

57:38.871 --> 57:40.771
because l'm so
tough and strong.

57:40.873 --> 57:42.306
Oh. Right.
And handsome.

57:42.407 --> 57:43.669
Okay.

57:43.775 --> 57:45.299
You're pretty.. .
You're pretty tough.

57:46.378 --> 57:48.369
l am tough.
You're tough.
You're a tough cop.

57:48.480 --> 57:49.606
Look. You're saying it,
but you're laughing.

57:49.781 --> 57:50.907
No, you're.. .
You're.. .

57:51.016 --> 57:52.176
You didn't let
me flex that time.

57:52.351 --> 57:53.511
That was unfair.
l'm really tough.

57:53.752 --> 57:55.549
So am l.
No.

57:55.687 --> 57:57.882
Yeah. l could be a cop.

57:58.190 --> 58:01.057
You think
you could be a cop?
Yeah.

58:01.160 --> 58:02.149
Okay.
Yeah.

58:02.261 --> 58:04.092
Let's see.
You know what?

58:04.196 --> 58:07.222
The sun is nearly up.
Let's go and see if
you've got what it takes.

58:09.234 --> 58:10.201
That's right.
Now, plant your feet.

58:10.369 --> 58:11.336
ANNlE: Okay.

58:11.436 --> 58:12.425
Good.

58:13.105 --> 58:14.572
And take aim.

58:16.208 --> 58:19.507
Now, put your left
hand behind your head.

58:20.579 --> 58:22.376
Yeah. And just
drop your left hip.

58:26.084 --> 58:28.052
l'm kidding. Put your
arms out straight.
Okay.

58:28.554 --> 58:30.385
You want to hit the middle
of the license plate.

58:30.489 --> 58:31.956
That's where you get
the most accurate reading.

58:32.057 --> 58:34.116
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
You ready?

58:34.226 --> 58:35.215
Okay.

58:36.862 --> 58:39.729
Fifty-eight.
What's the speed limit?

58:39.831 --> 58:41.025
Fifty-five.

58:41.133 --> 58:43.761
Okay, they were all right.
We'll let them go.

58:43.869 --> 58:46.463
You were born
to do this.
Look at you.

58:47.439 --> 58:48.770
Okay.
All right,
here we go.

58:50.776 --> 58:52.368
Sixty-three.

58:52.778 --> 58:54.211
You are missing
some good ones here.

58:54.313 --> 58:57.578
People are on
their way to work.
Why ruin their day?

58:58.283 --> 58:59.750
Okay, watch this. 48.

59:01.553 --> 59:02.542
Forty-eight.
How did you do that?

59:02.654 --> 59:03.780
lt wasn't!
Yes, it was.

59:03.889 --> 59:05.288
That's never happened.
Are you serious?

59:05.390 --> 59:06.823
lt was 48?
Yes, 48!

59:06.925 --> 59:08.552
Yeah.
l'm so impressed.

59:08.660 --> 59:09.820
l'm pretty impressive.

59:09.928 --> 59:11.828
l'm very impressed by you.

59:12.731 --> 59:13.698
Whoa!

59:13.999 --> 59:14.966
Whoa!

59:15.200 --> 59:16.633
Whoa!
Damn!

59:17.469 --> 59:18.595
That was 91 .
91?

59:18.704 --> 59:19.693
Yes. Can we go?

59:19.805 --> 59:20.772
We can go.

59:22.007 --> 59:23.031
Come on, hot dogger.

59:25.444 --> 59:26.570
RHODES: Let's get that fucker.

59:26.745 --> 59:27.905
ANNlE: Oh, my God!

59:29.014 --> 59:30.345
Oh, my God!

59:39.825 --> 59:42.851
...family lake house. Perfect.

59:51.069 --> 59:54.698
Hello?
l just got your e-mail.
Lake house?

59:55.374 --> 59:57.205
Yeah.

59:57.309 --> 59:59.607
Yeah, it's
Lillian's parents' house.

59:59.711 --> 01:00:02.202
We used to go there
all the time in the
summers and everything.

01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:04.849
<i>lt's one of...</i>
A bachelorette in a cabin?

01:00:05.217 --> 01:00:07.378
Wait. Can you.. .
Hold that thought. Hold on.

01:00:07.486 --> 01:00:08.475
Hello?

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.888
Fucking Helen. Hello?

01:00:11.256 --> 01:00:12.848
Annie, it's Rita.

01:00:13.091 --> 01:00:14.183
Hi.

01:00:14.293 --> 01:00:17.558
Listen, l need a trip
that l can fantasize forever

01:00:17.663 --> 01:00:19.563
so that l am able to
have sex with my husband.

01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:21.756
<i>That's why</i>
<i>l'm thinking Vegas.</i>

01:00:22.668 --> 01:00:23.657
Vegas?

01:00:23.769 --> 01:00:24.736
Hang on. Hey!

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:27.438
<i>Shut your filthy</i>
<i>fucking mouths! l'm sorry.</i>

01:00:27.539 --> 01:00:28.938
l'm surrounded by savages.

01:00:30.108 --> 01:00:31.973
You know what?
l should probably run.
My other line is ringing.

01:00:32.077 --> 01:00:34.307
You know, l can get cocaine
from my hairdresser.

01:00:34.579 --> 01:00:36.877
Okay, bye. Hello?

01:00:37.249 --> 01:00:38.238
Annie.
Yeah?

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:41.477
l'm so excited.
Helen just called.
She said we can go to Vegas.

01:00:41.753 --> 01:00:44.551
You know.. .
Yeah, but we have to.. .
We have to fly there, and.. .

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:47.818
Okay, Annie, l know
you are afraid of flying,

01:00:47.926 --> 01:00:50.895
<i>but l want to see Criss Angel,</i>
<i>but l'm scared.</i>

01:00:51.663 --> 01:00:53.028
Which l sort of love.

01:00:53.532 --> 01:00:54.760
Can you just hold on
for one second?

01:00:54.866 --> 01:00:57.027
<i>Oh, sure, sure, sure. l...</i>
Thanks. Hold on.
God damn it.

01:00:57.235 --> 01:00:59.135
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey, Annie, it's Megan.

01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:00.260
Hey.

01:01:00.372 --> 01:01:02.704
l just had some thoughts
about the bachelorette party.

01:01:02.874 --> 01:01:04.398
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:06.041
Easy-peasy. Vegas it is.

01:01:07.245 --> 01:01:08.234
Helen called you,
didn't she?

01:01:08.413 --> 01:01:09.971
Yeah, she got the jump on you.

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.441
l want balls in my face.

01:01:13.652 --> 01:01:14.880
Honestly, l think it's Vegas.

01:01:15.053 --> 01:01:16.918
l love puppets.
Balls.

01:01:17.289 --> 01:01:18.313
l guess we are undecided.

01:01:48.353 --> 01:01:50.344
l feel so bad Annie's
stuck back in coach.

01:01:50.555 --> 01:01:51.886
l know, l offered
to pay for her

01:01:52.057 --> 01:01:53.422
so she could sit
in first class,

01:01:53.525 --> 01:01:55.686
but she said no.

01:01:55.794 --> 01:01:56.886
She's too proud.

01:01:56.995 --> 01:01:58.553
lt was nice of you to offer.

01:02:01.366 --> 01:02:02.424
No carry-on, huh?

01:02:03.301 --> 01:02:05.030
No.
Yeah, l noticed.

01:02:05.137 --> 01:02:07.469
l noticed you
didn't put anything
in the overhead bin either.

01:02:07.572 --> 01:02:08.561
And l get it.

01:02:08.807 --> 01:02:12.208
l get it. l want you to know,
protect and serve

01:02:12.444 --> 01:02:13.843
Air Marshal-style.

01:02:14.413 --> 01:02:15.505
What?

01:02:15.647 --> 01:02:17.615
l don't want to
infringe on your privacy, man.

01:02:17.716 --> 01:02:20.082
l just.. . l really appreciate
what you do for this country.

01:02:20.652 --> 01:02:22.483
And l respect
the hell out of you.

01:02:24.623 --> 01:02:25.647
That's great.

01:02:26.324 --> 01:02:28.451
l'm not an Air Marshal.
l'm going to take a nap.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.618
Awesome.
Cool.

01:02:29.895 --> 01:02:32.125
l'll take the first watch.

01:02:32.631 --> 01:02:35.930
l'm not an Air Marshal.
You don't need
to take a watch.

01:02:36.034 --> 01:02:37.194
Okay.

01:02:38.203 --> 01:02:40.296
l've got the first watch.

01:02:40.572 --> 01:02:41.869
PlLOT: <i>Please check</i>
<i>your seatbelts</i>

01:02:41.973 --> 01:02:44.100
<i>and that your seat backs</i>
<i>are in an upright</i>
<i>position before takeoff.</i>

01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:45.198
Gosh.

01:02:46.711 --> 01:02:48.702
l am really hoping
this flight is quick,

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.871
and we get there on
the ground safely.

01:02:50.982 --> 01:02:52.006
l'm not a good flyer,
l'm sorry.

01:02:52.417 --> 01:02:55.284
l had a dream last
night that we went down.

01:02:55.387 --> 01:02:58.151
Yep. lt was terrible.
You were in it.

01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:00.724
What?
lt sounds like
something's happening.

01:03:10.335 --> 01:03:11.666
Annie, what are you
doing up here?

01:03:11.837 --> 01:03:13.168
You are supposed
to be in your seat.

01:03:13.271 --> 01:03:14.602
l know.
l'm freaking out
a little bit.

01:03:14.706 --> 01:03:17.504
Ma'am, we're still ascending.
You're gonna need to
return to your seat.

01:03:17.709 --> 01:03:18.937
Okay, l was just.. .

01:03:19.044 --> 01:03:22.013
Annie, l have something.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.774
Take two, you'll fall asleep,
wake up and we'll be there.
Here.

01:03:26.418 --> 01:03:28.784
Ma'am, you're going
to have to return to
your seat, please.

01:03:29.054 --> 01:03:30.487
lt's fine.
Okay. All right.

01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:32.557
STEWARDESS: Ma'am!
All right. All right.

01:03:33.792 --> 01:03:37.023
Oh, my God, l feel terrible.
l should be sitting
back there with her.

01:03:37.128 --> 01:03:40.029
l shouldn't be up
here in first class.
l feel like such a jerk.

01:03:40.131 --> 01:03:42.031
Lil, this is
your weekend, okay?

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.100
You are
treating yourself.
Just relax.

01:03:44.336 --> 01:03:45.860
She will be fine.
She will make friends.

01:03:45.971 --> 01:03:48.064
There is much more sense
of community in coach,
l promise you.

01:03:48.173 --> 01:03:49.231
She'll be fine.

01:03:52.644 --> 01:03:55.340
l can't believe
you've never been
with anybody else.

01:03:56.281 --> 01:03:57.407
Just Kevin.

01:04:00.986 --> 01:04:02.419
l'm sorry. l just.. .

01:04:02.721 --> 01:04:05.087
Becca, l just can't
help but feel bad for you.

01:04:05.524 --> 01:04:07.856
You don't even
know what you want.

01:04:08.059 --> 01:04:09.856
l got to know where
you keep the gun, man.

01:04:10.128 --> 01:04:12.460
l mean, is it ankle,
hip, lower back?

01:04:12.697 --> 01:04:15.291
You don't.. .
Between the cheeks, do you?

01:04:15.433 --> 01:04:20.393
No, l don't stick
a gun up my butt.
That's stupid.

01:04:20.505 --> 01:04:21.597
l didn't say ''up.' '

01:04:21.873 --> 01:04:25.434
l just knew of a guy,
that guy did a lot
of undercover work.

01:04:25.744 --> 01:04:29.612
And all l know is
he had tape marks
all up and down his cheeks.

01:04:30.482 --> 01:04:31.608
That can't be true.

01:04:31.917 --> 01:04:34.010
People don't keep
guns up their asses

01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:36.553
because if you
needed to use it,
how are you going to get it?

01:04:36.721 --> 01:04:38.120
He cut a hole in his pocket.

01:04:38.323 --> 01:04:40.120
What?
ln his back pocket.

01:04:40.592 --> 01:04:41.854
You have got to get
something out of your ass

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.951
and you cut a hole in
the back of your jeans,

01:04:44.062 --> 01:04:45.927
you want to tell me
you can't get to something?

01:04:46.631 --> 01:04:49.657
l don't have a gun
for you to put up my ass
to make your point.

01:04:49.768 --> 01:04:51.861
l can put my Nano.
l will show you.

01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:53.335
l will.. .
lf you get me scissors,

01:04:53.505 --> 01:04:54.870
l will cut
a hole in my pocket.

01:04:55.407 --> 01:04:59.275
And you will
never find this again
until l want you to find it.

01:05:00.545 --> 01:05:04.982
Kevin can only have sex
in bed, in the dark,
under the covers,

01:05:05.083 --> 01:05:06.414
only after
we have showered

01:05:07.018 --> 01:05:08.383
separately.

01:05:09.521 --> 01:05:11.546
And sometimes,
by the time
we are finished

01:05:11.723 --> 01:05:13.782
cleaning ourselves,
he's too tired.

01:05:14.726 --> 01:05:19.390
And then l pretend l'm tired,
but l'm not tired.
l'm not tired. l'm not tired.

01:05:19.598 --> 01:05:22.567
That's why every girl needs
those slutty college years.

01:05:22.767 --> 01:05:26.362
To experiment,
get it out of your system,
find out what you like.

01:05:27.138 --> 01:05:30.437
Excuse me, could l
have a glass of alcohol
when you get a chance?

01:05:31.376 --> 01:05:34.209
Two double
Seven and Sevens.

01:05:35.146 --> 01:05:36.613
ls that.. .

01:05:36.815 --> 01:05:38.942
You will like it.
lt's sweet.

01:05:39.651 --> 01:05:40.618
l have to go
to the bathroom.

01:05:40.819 --> 01:05:43.720
But l heard about
a woman who went to
the bathroom on a plane.

01:05:43.922 --> 01:05:45.913
She got sucked
into the toilet.

01:05:46.958 --> 01:05:48.550
Sucked right in.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:52.822
Are you okay?

01:05:52.998 --> 01:05:54.124
Yes.

01:05:54.332 --> 01:05:57.768
Yeah, l just think
that what you gave me
didn't really do anything.

01:05:57.969 --> 01:06:01.461
l just have too much adrenalin
or something. But, thanks.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.868
Why don't you take
my scotch?

01:06:05.076 --> 01:06:07.943
lt will just give the pill
a little kick that it needs.

01:06:08.146 --> 01:06:09.773
Honestly,
l do it all the time.
Yeah?

01:06:09.981 --> 01:06:12.415
Yeah, and l'm much
smaller than you,
so you'll handle it.

01:06:13.652 --> 01:06:14.641
Well, thanks.

01:06:14.853 --> 01:06:16.252
Yeah?
Okay.

01:06:29.801 --> 01:06:30.859
Yummy?

01:06:31.036 --> 01:06:32.128
Yeah, it's good.

01:06:32.337 --> 01:06:34.430
You should just toss it back.
Don't waste any more time.

01:06:34.639 --> 01:06:35.663
Okay.

01:06:40.545 --> 01:06:41.671
Ohh. Look at that.

01:06:43.848 --> 01:06:47.113
Okay, that'll do it.
That'll do it.

01:06:47.619 --> 01:06:49.280
So you don't even
have sex anymore?

01:06:49.487 --> 01:06:51.785
No, l have sex constantly.

01:06:52.123 --> 01:06:53.420
The sex is constant.

01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:56.253
But he hasn't
kissed me in five years.

01:06:56.461 --> 01:06:57.826
What are you doing
when you are
having sex, then?

01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:01.828
Thinking about other things
and wishing it would stop.

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:04.601
You know, sometimes
l just want to watch

01:07:04.769 --> 01:07:06.703
<i>The Daily Show</i>
without him entering me.

01:07:07.739 --> 01:07:10.105
lt's the Wet
Republic Ultra Pool.
No.

01:07:10.308 --> 01:07:11.275
Are you kidding?

01:07:11.476 --> 01:07:12.773
What is it again?

01:07:12.877 --> 01:07:14.504
HELEN: There is a bar in
the pool and a tiger.

01:07:14.679 --> 01:07:16.306
LlLLlAN: What?

01:07:16.514 --> 01:07:18.311
HELEN: lt's crazy.
lt's Vegas at its best.

01:07:18.516 --> 01:07:22.008
Wait a minute.
ls this that place
that was on <i>The Real World?</i>

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.814
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God. lt's.. .

01:07:25.023 --> 01:07:27.457
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

01:07:27.659 --> 01:07:31.527
l'm good.
l'm so much more relaxed.
Thank you, Helen.

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:36.224
l just feel like
l'm excited,
and l feel relaxed.

01:07:36.434 --> 01:07:38.493
And l'm ready

01:07:38.703 --> 01:07:42.298
to party

01:07:42.507 --> 01:07:45.738
with the best of them!

01:07:45.944 --> 01:07:50.313
<i>And l'm going to</i>
<i>go down to the river</i>

01:07:50.515 --> 01:07:55.248
Wow! lt looks like somebody
is really relaxing now.

01:07:55.587 --> 01:07:58.579
What are you guys
talking about up here?

01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:01.418
We are going to
a restaurant tonight.
l know the owner, so.. .

01:08:01.626 --> 01:08:03.059
You do?

01:08:04.929 --> 01:08:07.022
Ohh. Helen knows the owner.

01:08:08.133 --> 01:08:09.100
Uhh!

01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:12.395
Big whoop.

01:08:12.604 --> 01:08:14.572
Let's go take a nap.
What do you say?

01:08:14.773 --> 01:08:16.764
Miss, you cannot be up here.

01:08:16.975 --> 01:08:19.273
Hello, grandpa.

01:08:20.377 --> 01:08:22.140
l'm sorry.
l just want
to be here with

01:08:22.313 --> 01:08:24.076
my friends,
because l'm
with this group.

01:08:24.282 --> 01:08:27.080
The sign just went off.
Can't she stay up here
for a minute and just talk?

01:08:27.285 --> 01:08:28.274
STEWARD: Absolutely not.

01:08:28.486 --> 01:08:30.386
Coach passengers
are not allowed
up here in first class.

01:08:30.587 --> 01:08:31.885
lt's policy.
l'm sorry.

01:08:32.122 --> 01:08:33.090
Ooh!

01:08:33.323 --> 01:08:37.555
This is a very
strict plane
that l'm on.

01:08:37.761 --> 01:08:39.389
Welcome to Germany.

01:08:40.999 --> 01:08:44.594
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> asshole.

01:08:44.803 --> 01:08:45.792
All right.

01:08:46.004 --> 01:08:46.970
Why don't you go lay down?

01:08:47.171 --> 01:08:49.435
l'm going to go take a nap.
l'm tired.

01:08:49.607 --> 01:08:50.631
l think it's a good idea.

01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:53.970
Catch you on the flip side,
motherfuckers.

01:08:55.113 --> 01:08:56.080
l'm sorry.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.205
l'm leaving.

01:08:57.348 --> 01:08:58.337
Thank you.

01:08:59.751 --> 01:09:02.082
This should be open,
because it's civil rights.

01:09:02.287 --> 01:09:03.549
This is the '90s.

01:09:03.755 --> 01:09:06.724
Right. lt's not.
You're in the wrong decade.

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:08.586
You are.
Okay, l am.

01:09:08.792 --> 01:09:09.782
Thank you.

01:09:10.194 --> 01:09:12.595
Holy shit.
What did you give her?

01:09:31.216 --> 01:09:32.205
Miss?

01:09:33.984 --> 01:09:36.078
No. lt's not me.

01:09:36.287 --> 01:09:38.618
Yes, it is you.
Please go back
to your seat.

01:09:38.823 --> 01:09:40.814
Yes, l am with him.

01:09:41.024 --> 01:09:43.323
l am Mrs. lglesias.

01:09:43.528 --> 01:09:44.495
No, you are not.

01:09:44.662 --> 01:09:47.426
You were just out here
and you put sunglasses on.
Out.

01:09:47.866 --> 01:09:48.832
But l don't want to.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.366
Sir, she can
have my seat, okay?

01:09:51.469 --> 01:09:53.630
Everyone should
experience first class
at least once in their lives.

01:09:53.738 --> 01:09:55.968
And Annie shouldn't
miss out just because
she can't afford it.

01:09:56.174 --> 01:09:57.698
No, ma'am, l'm
afraid that's not allowed.

01:09:57.909 --> 01:09:59.809
Help me, l'm poor.
LlLLlAN: No, listen,

01:10:00.011 --> 01:10:02.673
we're a whole wedding party.
l'm the bride.
l'm getting married.

01:10:02.881 --> 01:10:05.714
This seat is empty.
She's obviously nervous.
We'll calm her down and.. .

01:10:05.917 --> 01:10:07.509
l understand.
But Claire is right.

01:10:07.719 --> 01:10:09.050
Everybody,
go back to your seats.

01:10:09.254 --> 01:10:10.687
Okay, you especially.

01:10:10.889 --> 01:10:12.823
You have three seconds
to get back to your seat.

01:10:14.092 --> 01:10:16.117
You can't get
anywhere in three seconds.

01:10:16.327 --> 01:10:17.385
Well, you'd better try.

01:10:17.595 --> 01:10:18.926
You are setting me
up for a loss already.

01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:20.019
Thank you.

01:10:21.266 --> 01:10:23.700
Whatever you say, Stove.

01:10:23.902 --> 01:10:25.233
lt's Steve.

01:10:26.604 --> 01:10:28.333
''Stove.' '
What kind of name is that?

01:10:28.539 --> 01:10:30.336
That's not a name.
My name is Steve.

01:10:30.541 --> 01:10:31.735
Are you an appliance?

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:33.707
No, l'm a man,
and my name is Steve.

01:10:33.912 --> 01:10:35.243
You are a flight attendant.

01:10:35.446 --> 01:10:38.040
That's absolutely
accurate.

01:10:39.951 --> 01:10:42.215
You can close that.
Thank you.

01:10:46.758 --> 01:10:48.419
Hey, not-Air Marshall Jon.

01:10:48.626 --> 01:10:51.186
You want to get
back in that restroom
and not rest?

01:10:51.396 --> 01:10:53.261
No, l have to get
back to my seat.

01:10:53.464 --> 01:10:56.024
Yeah, you gotta
get back on my seat.

01:10:58.136 --> 01:10:59.103
You get it?

01:10:59.304 --> 01:11:00.737
Yeah,
l definitely
got it.

01:11:00.939 --> 01:11:02.406
Oh-oh. What's that?

01:11:04.575 --> 01:11:07.408
l got to get back to my seat.
Could you just
move your leg, please?

01:11:07.612 --> 01:11:09.079
l got to go.

01:11:09.414 --> 01:11:11.348
Oh-oh.
Oh-oh.

01:11:11.449 --> 01:11:13.576
Somebody found a souvenir.

01:11:14.118 --> 01:11:17.747
You feel that
steam heat coming?
That's from my undercarriage.

01:11:18.156 --> 01:11:20.317
That can go up
and higher.

01:11:20.525 --> 01:11:21.890
Okay.

01:11:23.695 --> 01:11:25.424
Jon, get us a blanket.

01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:26.961
No.

01:11:27.165 --> 01:11:29.793
l got to take a whiz
and l'll be right back.

01:11:30.835 --> 01:11:31.824
Cool.

01:11:34.172 --> 01:11:37.835
l don't want you to be
a big fuck-up like me.

01:11:38.042 --> 01:11:39.339
How do you think l feel?

01:11:39.544 --> 01:11:42.138
Like me.
You can still
turn it around.

01:11:42.347 --> 01:11:43.678
No, don't.

01:11:45.016 --> 01:11:46.142
Stop it!

01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:49.013
You are more
beautiful than
Cinderella.

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:53.424
You smell like
pine needles and you
have a face like sunshine.

01:12:07.005 --> 01:12:08.131
What?

01:12:11.309 --> 01:12:12.469
Oh, no.

01:12:13.678 --> 01:12:15.043
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:12:15.246 --> 01:12:18.374
<i>as you can see,</i>

<i>the ''fasten seatbelt'' sign.</i>

01:12:20.752 --> 01:12:21.980
ANNlE:
<i>l have an announcement, too.</i>

01:12:22.086 --> 01:12:24.020
<i>There is a Colonial woman</i>

<i>There's something</i>

01:12:27.091 --> 01:12:28.080
Steve.
All right.

01:12:28.192 --> 01:12:29.318
<i>There's a Colonial woman.</i>

01:12:29.427 --> 01:12:31.088
<i>She was churning</i>
<i>butter on that wing.</i>
Steve, get her.

01:12:31.195 --> 01:12:32.685
<i>She is out there right now.</i>
Shit!

01:12:32.897 --> 01:12:35.127
Everyone, remain calm!
l'm an Air Marshal.

01:12:36.067 --> 01:12:38.695
Yes! l knew it.
l got your back, Jon!

01:12:38.803 --> 01:12:40.202
<i>There is a woman on the wing.</i>
<i>l saw her.</i>

<i>There's something</i>

Let's get out!
Let's open the doors
and get out!

01:12:44.008 --> 01:12:46.568
<i>She is dressed in</i>
<i>traditional Colonial garb.</i>

01:12:47.045 --> 01:12:48.876
Say goodbye!
We are going down!

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:50.004
Stay calm.

01:12:50.114 --> 01:12:51.376
ANNlE: There is something
they are not telling us.

01:12:51.482 --> 01:12:53.109
There is a Colonial
woman on the wing.

01:12:53.751 --> 01:12:54.740
l will cover the pilot!

01:12:59.424 --> 01:13:01.449
Who is she?
What does she want?

01:13:32.723 --> 01:13:34.816
Just let me make it
up to you, please.

01:13:35.827 --> 01:13:37.692
l'm telling you,

01:13:37.895 --> 01:13:40.523
your shower is
going to be amazing.

01:13:40.731 --> 01:13:42.631
l have so many ideas.

01:13:42.834 --> 01:13:44.461
l want to talk to
you about the shower.

01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:47.001
l feel like

01:13:47.205 --> 01:13:51.164
it has been really
overwhelming for you.

01:13:52.009 --> 01:13:53.636
lt's just starting
to make you crazy.

01:13:53.845 --> 01:13:56.313
No, Lil, l'm fine.
l mean.. .

01:13:57.682 --> 01:13:59.240
Lil, l'm fine.

01:13:59.417 --> 01:14:00.975
No, you're not fine.

01:14:01.185 --> 01:14:03.050
You are not fine, Annie,

01:14:03.254 --> 01:14:06.280
and we need things to just

01:14:07.859 --> 01:14:09.451
flow smoothly from now on

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:13.096
and Helen just knows
how to do this kind of stuff.

01:14:13.297 --> 01:14:15.128
She does it all the time.

01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:17.198
She is good at it.
She likes doing it.

01:14:17.802 --> 01:14:20.270
This way you don't have to

01:14:21.072 --> 01:14:24.769
plan any more
lunches or trips.

01:14:24.976 --> 01:14:26.773
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

01:14:26.978 --> 01:14:28.275
l get it.

01:14:28.479 --> 01:14:30.777
l think it'll be
best here on out

01:14:30.982 --> 01:14:33.815
for the shower
and for everything.

01:14:34.318 --> 01:14:36.616
Yeah,
whatever you want.

01:14:36.821 --> 01:14:39.449
l mean,
it's probably best.

01:14:39.657 --> 01:14:41.682
l think so, right?

01:14:41.893 --> 01:14:43.190
Yeah.
l just want you
to be happy.

01:14:43.394 --> 01:14:45.487
l think that
will make me happy.
lt will be good.

01:14:45.696 --> 01:14:47.687
Okay.
Okay.

01:14:48.666 --> 01:14:49.826
Good.

01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:14.925
Hey.

01:15:15.393 --> 01:15:16.360
Hey.

01:15:16.561 --> 01:15:18.995
Do you want to hang out?

01:15:26.871 --> 01:15:28.270
ANNlE: lt's not funny!
Stop laughing.

01:15:28.439 --> 01:15:29.838
RHODES: lt's a little funny.

01:15:30.041 --> 01:15:32.805
None of those girls
are laughing, believe me.

01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:35.171
lt's not funny.
Have you ever been
kicked off a plane?

01:15:35.379 --> 01:15:36.346
l can't say that l have.

01:15:36.514 --> 01:15:37.481
Thank you.

01:15:37.682 --> 01:15:41.345
All of the girls
hate me right now.

01:15:41.552 --> 01:15:43.713
You are like
the maid of dishonor.

01:15:46.257 --> 01:15:48.885
l hope Lillian isn't
going to be mad at me
for too long.

01:15:49.093 --> 01:15:50.754
No, she will be all right.

01:15:50.962 --> 01:15:52.327
l don't know,
l just wish things were

01:15:52.496 --> 01:15:53.895
the way that they
used to be, you know.

01:15:54.098 --> 01:15:55.861
l feel like her
life is going off

01:15:56.067 --> 01:15:59.400
and getting perfect,
and mine is just like.. .

01:16:01.239 --> 01:16:02.570
lt will turn around,
you know.

01:16:02.773 --> 01:16:04.536
l have been hearing
that for a long time.

01:16:04.742 --> 01:16:06.266
lt's going to turn around.
l just know it.

01:16:06.477 --> 01:16:08.035
Anyway.

01:16:09.113 --> 01:16:10.239
You got to bake.

01:16:10.448 --> 01:16:12.109
l don't really do
that anymore, l told you.

01:16:12.316 --> 01:16:13.442
Why?

01:16:13.618 --> 01:16:14.778
l don't know,
it's just.. .

01:16:16.587 --> 01:16:19.556
l don't know,
after it just went under,
l just, kind of,

01:16:21.225 --> 01:16:22.624
stopped, l guess.

01:16:22.827 --> 01:16:24.795
lt doesn't make
me happy anymore.

01:16:24.996 --> 01:16:26.657
Just because you didn't
make any money at it,

01:16:26.764 --> 01:16:27.788
doesn't mean that
you failed at it.

01:16:28.666 --> 01:16:30.395
l lost a lot of money.

01:16:30.601 --> 01:16:32.535
All my money.

01:16:32.803 --> 01:16:34.270
But you are so good at it.

01:16:34.472 --> 01:16:35.905
Oh, well.
Let's change the subject.

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.233
No more baking.
l'm done.

01:16:38.442 --> 01:16:40.569
l don't know how
you just can't do it anymore.

01:16:40.778 --> 01:16:44.043
lf l wasn't a cop anymore,
l would still.. .

01:16:44.248 --> 01:16:45.215
Arrest people?

01:16:45.416 --> 01:16:47.384
...go out with
a gun and shoot people.

01:16:48.219 --> 01:16:50.687
l probably wouldn't do that.
l'm just trying to
make you feel better.

01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:54.517
You are okay, you know.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:56.727
You don't
know me very well.

01:16:56.927 --> 01:16:59.122
l know you well enough
to know that
you're not so bad.

01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:00.922
You got some stuff.
Oh, yeah.

01:17:01.132 --> 01:17:02.861
You got bits and
pieces going on.

01:17:02.967 --> 01:17:03.991
Thanks.

01:17:04.101 --> 01:17:06.035
l have been thinking
about you a little bit.

01:17:06.237 --> 01:17:07.898
About me? Really?

01:17:08.105 --> 01:17:09.538
There is something
about you.

01:17:09.974 --> 01:17:12.238
Something about
you that sticks.

01:17:17.915 --> 01:17:19.712
ANNlE: l hate buttons.

01:17:21.085 --> 01:17:22.450
Where is the bedroom?

01:17:27.258 --> 01:17:29.920
Sorry. lt's a mountain bike.
Are you okay?

01:17:30.127 --> 01:17:31.492
Do you like mountain biking?
Uh-huh.

01:17:36.133 --> 01:17:37.259
Take this off.

01:17:37.468 --> 01:17:38.833
l'm so glad
this is happening.

01:17:39.036 --> 01:17:40.230
So am l.

01:17:55.316 --> 01:17:56.943
Hello.
Morning.

01:17:57.152 --> 01:17:58.676
Sorry, l didn't
mean to freak you out.

01:17:58.887 --> 01:18:00.081
No, it's okay.

01:18:00.288 --> 01:18:02.347
l haven't been
sitting here that long.
Oh.

01:18:06.761 --> 01:18:08.194
Sorry, l guess l fell asleep.

01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:11.365
l didn't mean to sleep over.

01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:13.300
Don't be silly.

01:18:14.469 --> 01:18:15.936
l made you a cappuccino.

01:18:16.137 --> 01:18:18.435
Made it?
Yeah.

01:18:19.474 --> 01:18:21.305
So, last night was fun.

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:25.106
lt was.
lt was very fun.

01:18:26.681 --> 01:18:27.648
l had fun.

01:18:27.849 --> 01:18:29.441
lt was fun.

01:18:30.819 --> 01:18:33.481
lf you care to
accompany me to the kitchen,

01:18:33.688 --> 01:18:35.417
the fun may continue.

01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:37.648
A different kind of fun.

01:18:37.859 --> 01:18:41.420
But why don't you
just get dressed
and whatever, and.. .

01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:42.926
l left your
clothes over there.

01:18:43.097 --> 01:18:44.394
Okay.

01:18:44.599 --> 01:18:45.861
And l'll see you in there.

01:18:46.034 --> 01:18:47.331
Okay.

01:18:51.873 --> 01:18:53.568
RHODES: There she is.

01:18:54.476 --> 01:18:56.239
Your workshop awaits.

01:18:56.478 --> 01:18:58.309
l know it's a bit crazy,
but l popped out

01:18:58.446 --> 01:19:01.244
and l got a few little
baking bits and pieces.

01:19:01.449 --> 01:19:02.507
Butter, milk.

01:19:02.717 --> 01:19:05.242
Because l thought
that it would be fun
for us to bake together today.

01:19:05.453 --> 01:19:07.250
Obviously, you will
be doing the baking.

01:19:07.455 --> 01:19:09.013
l will be doing the eating.

01:19:09.224 --> 01:19:11.351
Because you are the expert.

01:19:11.826 --> 01:19:13.350
Yeah, l don't.. .

01:19:13.561 --> 01:19:15.426
l don't really wanna.. .

01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:18.121
Sorry. You went to
all this trouble, but.. .

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:20.767
Come on, l know you haven't
done it in a while,
but it'll be great.

01:19:20.969 --> 01:19:24.029
Don't be silly,
just get into it.
You are so good at it.

01:19:25.373 --> 01:19:27.603
All right. l get it.

01:19:27.809 --> 01:19:30.300
lt was a bit of a curve ball.

01:19:30.578 --> 01:19:32.443
Yeah, l think
l'm going to go.

01:19:32.647 --> 01:19:36.139
l'm sorry.
l should just
probably go.

01:19:36.718 --> 01:19:37.707
Annie,

01:19:38.887 --> 01:19:40.445
l don't know what
you are getting
so upset about.

01:19:40.655 --> 01:19:42.020
Because you don't know me.

01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:45.318
You don't know anything
about me or my life or.. .

01:19:45.527 --> 01:19:48.325
Well, no, because.. .
l don't know what
you're trying to do here.

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:50.555
l don't need you to fix me.
To fix you?

01:19:50.765 --> 01:19:53.131
l don't need any help.
l mean, who do
you think you are?

01:19:53.334 --> 01:19:56.030
Jesus, Annie,
we had a really good time.
And now you are being all.. .

01:19:56.237 --> 01:19:58.728
lt's my fault.
l shouldn't have
come here last night.

01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:00.965
Last night was a mistake.

01:20:01.175 --> 01:20:02.506
Fucking hell. All right.

01:20:18.526 --> 01:20:21.324
<i>Hey, it's Lillian.</i>
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

01:20:22.196 --> 01:20:24.721
Hey, Lil, it's me.

01:20:25.166 --> 01:20:26.133
Umm.. .

01:20:26.801 --> 01:20:31.534
l'm sure you're probably still
a little bit mad at me,
but l hope not.

01:20:32.273 --> 01:20:36.403
Anyway, the excitement
still continues with me.

01:20:37.879 --> 01:20:41.576
l just slept with
a cop that pulled me over

01:20:41.783 --> 01:20:46.880
and l woke up today,
and he was really
sweet and nice and cute.

01:20:47.221 --> 01:20:50.418
So, naturally,
l ran out
as fast as l could.

01:20:50.625 --> 01:20:52.252
What's wrong with me?

01:20:52.827 --> 01:20:53.816
Umm.. .

01:20:53.928 --> 01:20:56.954
Anyway, l know you
are busy and stuff,

01:20:57.131 --> 01:21:00.191
so just call me
when you get a chance.

01:21:00.401 --> 01:21:04.531
l'd love to talk
this out with you
when you can.

01:21:04.739 --> 01:21:06.604
Okay, bye.

01:21:14.816 --> 01:21:17.444
BRYNN: Annie! Annie, wake up.

01:21:17.652 --> 01:21:19.381
lt's 11 :00 a.m .

01:21:21.089 --> 01:21:22.784
Oh, shit.

01:21:22.991 --> 01:21:24.583
You got a package.

01:21:24.792 --> 01:21:28.284
l'd bring it to you,
but you said,
''Don't touch my things.' '

01:21:57.892 --> 01:21:59.655
<i>Please join us for</i>
<i>a Parisian brunch</i>

01:21:59.761 --> 01:22:01.456
<i>at the home of</i>
<i>Helen Harris lll</i>

01:22:01.562 --> 01:22:04.690
<i>to celebrate the marriage</i>
<i>of Lillian Donovan</i>
<i>and Douglas Price.</i>

01:22:05.233 --> 01:22:10.136
<i>Let us shower Lillian</i>
<i>with gifts and love.</i>
Répondez s'il vous plaît. <i>Yay!</i>

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.777
Excuse me.
Oh. Hi.

01:22:20.882 --> 01:22:23.316
l'm looking for a birthday
gift for my best friend.
Oh.

01:22:23.418 --> 01:22:25.943
l want to get her
a necklace that says,
''Best Friends Forever.' '

01:22:26.754 --> 01:22:28.221
You sure you want
it to say ''Forever''?

01:22:29.157 --> 01:22:30.215
Yeah, why?

01:22:30.391 --> 01:22:32.018
Come on. ''Forever''?

01:22:32.927 --> 01:22:33.916
Forever.

01:22:34.028 --> 01:22:36.189
l don't think you guys
will be best friends forever.
No offense.

01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:37.695
But you know.. .

01:22:37.832 --> 01:22:39.823
The friends you have
when you are
younger sometimes.. .

01:22:40.101 --> 01:22:42.126
Sometimes you grow apart
when you get older.

01:22:42.236 --> 01:22:43.726
Maybe she'll find
a new best friend.

01:22:43.938 --> 01:22:45.633
And maybe she
will be more
successful than you are

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:47.935
and prettier and
richer and skinnier

01:22:48.109 --> 01:22:50.339
and they end up doing
everything together.

01:22:51.512 --> 01:22:52.740
You are weird.

01:22:53.047 --> 01:22:54.605
l'm not weird. Okay?

01:22:55.283 --> 01:22:56.272
Yes, you are.

01:22:56.384 --> 01:22:57.351
No, l'm not,
and you started it.

01:22:57.552 --> 01:22:59.042
No, you started it.

01:22:59.253 --> 01:23:01.084
Did you forget
to take your Xanax
this morning?

01:23:01.289 --> 01:23:02.756
God, l feel bad
for your parents.

01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:03.879
l feel bad for your face.

01:23:04.225 --> 01:23:06.250
Okay, well,
call me when
your boobs come in.

01:23:06.394 --> 01:23:08.021
You call me
when yours come in.

01:23:08.196 --> 01:23:10.096
What, do you have
four boyfriends?
Exactly.

01:23:10.298 --> 01:23:13.165
Yeah, okay, have fun
having a baby at your prom.

01:23:13.367 --> 01:23:14.857
You look like an old mop.

01:23:15.069 --> 01:23:16.866
You know what?
You're not as popular
as you think you are.

01:23:17.004 --> 01:23:17.971
l am very popular.

01:23:18.272 --> 01:23:20.206
l'm sure you are.

01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:21.766
Very popular.

01:23:22.009 --> 01:23:23.601
Well, you're an old,
single loser

01:23:23.778 --> 01:23:25.370
who is never going
to have any friends.

01:23:26.214 --> 01:23:27.476
You're a little cunt.

01:23:35.556 --> 01:23:36.750
l'm sorry.

01:23:40.561 --> 01:23:42.620
Let me tell my mom, okay.

01:23:43.264 --> 01:23:44.891
l already told her.

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:46.626
Was she mad?

01:23:55.476 --> 01:23:57.740
<i>Hi, Annie,</i>
<i>it's Rhodes again.</i>

01:23:57.945 --> 01:23:59.344
<i>Since you're not</i>
<i>returning any of my calls,</i>

01:23:59.514 --> 01:24:00.913
<i>l assume that</i>
<i>you're not interested</i>

01:24:01.115 --> 01:24:03.310
<i>in spending any</i>
<i>more time with me,</i>
<i>which is fine.</i>

01:24:03.518 --> 01:24:06.919
<i>So don't worry,</i>
<i>l won't be bothering</i>
<i>you ever again.</i>

01:24:07.789 --> 01:24:09.450
<i>Get those taillights fixed.</i>

01:24:17.298 --> 01:24:21.496
We'd like to invite you
to no longer live
with us anymore.

01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:24.699
What? What do you mean?
l don't get it.

01:24:25.039 --> 01:24:27.940
The thing is,
we decided that it was
actually a bit immature

01:24:28.042 --> 01:24:29.373
for a grown-up
brother and sister to

01:24:29.544 --> 01:24:30.875
still be living
together with a roommate.

01:24:31.179 --> 01:24:33.943
At our age, it's a bit
ridiculous, isn't it?
Yeah.

01:24:34.048 --> 01:24:36.141
We look a bit silly,
don't we?
Pathetic.

01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:38.409
So we are actually
going to live together alone.

01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.014
Without you.

01:24:40.288 --> 01:24:41.721
You're moving out.

01:24:45.459 --> 01:24:46.585
She's not moving.

01:24:46.694 --> 01:24:47.922
She will move.

01:24:48.129 --> 01:24:49.357
Eventually.
Eventually.

01:24:49.463 --> 01:24:50.521
She has to.

01:24:50.798 --> 01:24:51.856
She is taking it in.

01:24:51.966 --> 01:24:53.490
You have to leave.

01:24:53.701 --> 01:24:55.032
Oh! That's prickly.

01:25:00.341 --> 01:25:01.865
Hi.
Hi.

01:25:03.911 --> 01:25:06.345
Remember when you
thought l hit bottom?

01:25:07.248 --> 01:25:08.545
That wasn't bottom.

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:10.577
Come here.

01:25:11.419 --> 01:25:14.252
We're gonna have fun.
l, for one,
am really glad you're here.

01:25:14.755 --> 01:25:16.017
And guess what?

01:25:16.591 --> 01:25:18.149
Good timing.

01:25:18.693 --> 01:25:20.923
You know what
just came in today
on the Netflix?

01:25:21.395 --> 01:25:23.488
<i>Cast Away.</i> Tom Hanks.

01:25:23.698 --> 01:25:25.666
lt's like <i>Forrest Gump,</i>
but on an island.

01:25:25.867 --> 01:25:27.926
Honey, you are gonna love it.

01:25:56.497 --> 01:25:58.897
My God.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.833
This is her driveway?

01:26:02.403 --> 01:26:04.394
Who is that man?

01:26:08.609 --> 01:26:10.804
Are you a guest of
Helen Harris lll?

01:26:11.679 --> 01:26:13.772
Yes. Technically. l guess.

01:26:13.981 --> 01:26:15.949
An attendant will
meet you at the stables.

01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:17.376
Where?

01:26:17.551 --> 01:26:18.711
The shower is over
the second bridge.

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:21.753
Pink lemonade?
Thank you.

01:26:21.956 --> 01:26:24.948
l don't have a cup holder.
Can l just give that.. .

01:26:28.863 --> 01:26:31.957
Pink lemonade.
Nice. Nice touch.

01:26:33.501 --> 01:26:34.934
Shit.

01:26:42.777 --> 01:26:44.972
God damn it, that's good.

01:26:45.079 --> 01:26:46.046
Mmm.

01:26:47.982 --> 01:26:49.779
Shit, that is fresh.

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.800
GlRL 1 : This is the most
beautiful shower
l have ever been to.

01:27:09.236 --> 01:27:11.704
GlRL 2: Yes, and Helen
is giving out the
cutest party favors.

01:27:11.806 --> 01:27:14.639
GlRL 1 : l know,
l love their pink berets.

01:27:30.257 --> 01:27:32.020
Would you like
some champagne?
Yes.

01:27:32.493 --> 01:27:33.482
lt's French.

01:27:34.729 --> 01:27:36.594
Annie. Hey.

01:27:37.031 --> 01:27:37.998
Hi.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.997
How are you doing?
You're here.

01:27:41.569 --> 01:27:44.003
Yeah, l'm here.
l was invited. Sorry.

01:27:44.438 --> 01:27:46.804
Of course you were invited.
l just meant you have arrived.

01:27:46.907 --> 01:27:49.535
No, l was just joking.
Okay.

01:27:50.511 --> 01:27:52.103
Can you believe this?
lsn't it amazing?

01:27:52.947 --> 01:27:54.005
Yep.

01:27:54.215 --> 01:27:55.739
Yeah. lt's nice.

01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:57.884
Yeah. Pretty.

01:27:58.552 --> 01:27:59.951
Are we okay?

01:28:00.121 --> 01:28:01.554
Yes, l'm sorry
l haven't called.

01:28:01.756 --> 01:28:04.190
l just didn't want
to bug you, but.. .

01:28:04.291 --> 01:28:06.589
Forgive me.
lt just got crazy.

01:28:06.694 --> 01:28:09.492
There has been lots
of organizing, and.. .
l have so much to tell you.

01:28:09.597 --> 01:28:12.088
l have to say hi to my aunt
or she will get mad at my mom.

01:28:12.199 --> 01:28:13.598
No, you gotta go do
your party rounds.

01:28:13.768 --> 01:28:15.201
Yeah.

01:28:15.403 --> 01:28:16.529
l'll see you in a minute.

01:28:16.704 --> 01:28:17.830
Yeah. Okay.

01:28:18.039 --> 01:28:19.700
Oh! Rita,
you got all our towels.

01:28:19.807 --> 01:28:22.071
Yes, l did.
Because l love you, kitten.

01:28:22.376 --> 01:28:24.344
All right,
let's see what's next.

01:28:24.512 --> 01:28:26.503
Another one,
another one, another one.

01:28:26.714 --> 01:28:30.013
l know who this is from.
l can tell by the wrapping.

01:28:30.217 --> 01:28:31.548
ls that you?

01:28:34.088 --> 01:28:36.386
Annie, you made this.

01:28:37.425 --> 01:28:38.449
Look.

01:28:38.726 --> 01:28:40.387
Oh, man.
LlLLlAN: Oh, my gosh.

01:28:40.628 --> 01:28:42.152
lt's us, Annie.

01:28:42.763 --> 01:28:44.731
MEGAN: Oh, my God.
Let me see.

01:28:46.233 --> 01:28:47.666
Oh, my God.

01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:53.663
This is all my
favorite stuff from all the
stores l love in Milwaukee.

01:28:53.774 --> 01:28:56.766
Annie!
This is so unbelievable.

01:28:57.278 --> 01:28:58.267
Wilson Phillips.

01:28:59.713 --> 01:29:00.941
Man, l love Wilson Phillips.

01:29:01.182 --> 01:29:03.173
We listened to <i>Hold On</i>
probably 10,000 times

01:29:03.284 --> 01:29:05.013
when l got my
driver's license.

01:29:05.252 --> 01:29:08.119
This is such an amazing gift.

01:29:08.456 --> 01:29:09.821
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:29:10.958 --> 01:29:12.585
l feel really bad, Lil,

01:29:12.693 --> 01:29:14.752
l didn't get a chance
to actually get you a present

01:29:14.862 --> 01:29:16.853
because l have been so busy
organizing the shower.

01:29:16.964 --> 01:29:19.455
Helen, please.
lt's more than enough.

01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:21.931
Here is a card to
say congratulations.

01:29:22.036 --> 01:29:25.802
Thank you.
Gosh, you have
really outdone yourself.

01:29:28.175 --> 01:29:29.540
Oh, my God, Helen.

01:29:31.512 --> 01:29:33.104
WOMAN: Honey, what is it?

01:29:33.848 --> 01:29:36.214
Helen's taking me
to Paris.

01:29:39.019 --> 01:29:40.281
HELEN: Your face!

01:29:40.521 --> 01:29:41.988
l got you. l fooled you.

01:29:42.089 --> 01:29:43.056
Look at your face.

01:29:44.225 --> 01:29:47.353
lt's just a little
pre-wedding vacation.
And while we're there,

01:29:47.461 --> 01:29:49.691
we're gonna meet
the designer of her dress
and have a fitting.

01:29:49.864 --> 01:29:52.355
LlLLlAN: You are
taking me to Paris?

01:29:52.533 --> 01:29:55.058
Oh, my God! This is
the best present ever!

01:29:55.703 --> 01:29:57.193
Thank you so much.

01:29:57.338 --> 01:29:58.305
HELEN: <i>À Paris!</i>

01:29:58.472 --> 01:29:59.461
LlLLlAN: Oh, my God.

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:01.264
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:30:03.043 --> 01:30:04.340
Annie!
No, Mom.

01:30:04.445 --> 01:30:05.707
Motherfucking Paris?

01:30:05.913 --> 01:30:06.902
LlLLlAN: Annie,
what are you doing?

01:30:07.047 --> 01:30:10.346
l told you about Paris, Helen.
l told you about
this whole idea!

01:30:10.451 --> 01:30:11.748
Annie, calm down.
ANNlE: No, Lillian!

01:30:11.886 --> 01:30:14.411
What, you're gonna
go to Paris with Helen now?

01:30:14.588 --> 01:30:16.647
What, you guys are
gonna ride around
on bikes

01:30:16.757 --> 01:30:18.349
with berets and
fucking baguettes

01:30:18.526 --> 01:30:20.153
in the basket of
the front of your bikes?

01:30:20.261 --> 01:30:21.387
How romantic!

01:30:21.695 --> 01:30:24.994
What woman
gives another woman
a trip to Paris?

01:30:25.132 --> 01:30:27.032
Am l right? Lesbian.

01:30:27.268 --> 01:30:28.826
We're all thinking it,
aren't we?
l'm not.

01:30:28.936 --> 01:30:31.234
Okay? Yes, we're all
thinking it, right?
l was.

01:30:31.438 --> 01:30:34.236
Annie.. .
Lillian, this is not
the ''you'' that l know.

01:30:34.441 --> 01:30:35.738
The ''you'' that l
know would have

01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:37.207
walked in here
and rolled your eyes

01:30:37.378 --> 01:30:38.845
and thought
this was completely

01:30:39.013 --> 01:30:40.480
over-the-top,
ridiculous and stupid.

01:30:40.581 --> 01:30:44.073
Look at this shower!
Look at that fucking cookie!

01:30:44.318 --> 01:30:46.309
Did you really think
that this group of women

01:30:46.487 --> 01:30:48.512
was going to
finish that cookie?

01:30:48.689 --> 01:30:50.213
Really? You know what?
That reminds me, actually.

01:30:50.457 --> 01:30:53.915
l never got a chance
to try that fucking cookie!

01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:57.426
Stupid fucking cookie!

01:31:01.101 --> 01:31:03.899
Delicious! Stupid cookie.
l think l'll.. .

01:31:05.172 --> 01:31:08.141
Maybe it's better if l
dip it in the chocolate.

01:31:15.249 --> 01:31:16.409
ls this what
you want, Lillian?

01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:24.652
This is so awesome.

01:31:24.758 --> 01:31:31.095
All right,
let's have some nice,
hot, unsanitary chocolate!

01:31:38.038 --> 01:31:40.165
Ahh! lt's hot!
Jesus! God!

01:31:40.274 --> 01:31:42.936
Christ, Annie.
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

01:31:43.043 --> 01:31:44.874
What are you doing?
What am l doing?

01:31:44.979 --> 01:31:47.038
You wouldn't know,
would you?
Where have you been?

01:31:47.147 --> 01:31:49.274
You would have no idea.
Let me fill you in, okay?

01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:52.075
Ever since you got engaged,
everything has turned to shit!

01:31:52.186 --> 01:31:54.848
You know what?
This is supposed
to be about my time!

01:31:55.022 --> 01:31:57.081
You have managed
to ruin every event

01:31:57.258 --> 01:31:59.351
in my wedding.
Thank you very much.

01:31:59.493 --> 01:32:00.790
Okay, well,
thank you very much.

01:32:00.961 --> 01:32:02.292
lt's all her fault.
lt is not mine!

01:32:02.429 --> 01:32:03.623
And you would know that,

01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:06.700
if you got your
beautiful haired head
out of your asshole.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:10.998
ln fact, out of her asshole,
which l'm sure is
perfectly bleached.

01:32:11.138 --> 01:32:12.765
You know what? lt is!

01:32:12.873 --> 01:32:14.135
And you know how l know?

01:32:14.241 --> 01:32:16.106
Because l went to
the fucking salon with her

01:32:16.277 --> 01:32:18.177
and l got my
asshole bleached, too!

01:32:18.512 --> 01:32:21.345
And l love my new asshole!

01:32:22.283 --> 01:32:24.877
You know what?
Why can't you
just be happy for me

01:32:24.985 --> 01:32:28.580
and then go home and
talk behind my back later,
like a normal person?

01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:32.715
l am happy for you, Lillian.
l am very happy for you.

01:32:32.826 --> 01:32:36.387
l wish you well.
l won't bother
you anymore.

01:32:37.398 --> 01:32:40.094
Are you kidding me? Annie!

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.861
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:32:42.369 --> 01:32:44.633
LlLLlAN: Get back here! Stop.

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.831
No, no! She does
not get a party favor.

01:32:49.109 --> 01:32:50.940
She does not get a dog!

01:32:53.547 --> 01:32:55.139
And if you are
going to act like this,

01:32:55.249 --> 01:32:57.615
then don't even bother
coming to my wedding!

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.418
l'm proud of you, Lil.

01:33:07.594 --> 01:33:08.652
Shut up, Helen!

01:33:10.064 --> 01:33:12.931
Anybody else have anything
they want to share today?

01:33:15.235 --> 01:33:18.466
l took two dogs already.
They're in the back of my van.

01:33:36.957 --> 01:33:38.219
What?

01:33:47.801 --> 01:33:50.326
What? Where are you going?

01:33:51.071 --> 01:33:52.595
Hit and run! Classy!

01:33:52.873 --> 01:33:54.272
Perfect! Okay.

01:33:55.409 --> 01:33:58.936
l'm gonna find you!
l'm coming!

01:33:59.146 --> 01:34:03.480
Come on! Come on! Come on.

01:34:06.987 --> 01:34:08.955
No!

01:34:24.271 --> 01:34:26.535
Shit.

01:34:30.177 --> 01:34:32.338
l can't say
l'm surprised.

01:34:32.546 --> 01:34:34.673
l did tell you to
get your lights fixed.

01:34:34.882 --> 01:34:36.349
Yeah, l know.

01:34:36.517 --> 01:34:38.576
And now here we are.

01:34:40.187 --> 01:34:43.554
Look, l have
had a horrible day.

01:34:43.757 --> 01:34:46.089
l don't need a lecture
from you right now, okay?

01:34:46.293 --> 01:34:47.817
l just.. . Helen just.. .

01:34:48.295 --> 01:34:49.262
Oh! Don't.. .

01:34:49.696 --> 01:34:51.425
This didn't happen
because of Helen.

01:34:51.799 --> 01:34:54.495
This happened
because you didn't get
your taillights fixed.

01:34:54.701 --> 01:34:56.134
lt's pretty simple.

01:34:59.673 --> 01:35:01.937
Do you have any idea
how frustrating it is

01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:04.407
to see you,
night by night,
drive past me

01:35:04.611 --> 01:35:07.273
with your fucking
taillights still broken?

01:35:07.481 --> 01:35:09.574
Do you have any idea
how crazy that makes me?

01:35:09.783 --> 01:35:12.149
lt's a simple solution!

01:35:12.286 --> 01:35:13.344
Your problem, Annie,

01:35:13.454 --> 01:35:16.321
is that you just
don't understand
that you can hurt people

01:35:16.657 --> 01:35:18.648
with these broken lights.

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:22.019
Don't you see how
irresponsible this is?

01:35:22.129 --> 01:35:25.826
Yes, l should have
gotten my fucking
taillights fixed.

01:35:26.033 --> 01:35:27.933
But l didn't, okay?
l didn't.

01:35:28.135 --> 01:35:30.262
Listen,
don't worry about it.

01:35:30.471 --> 01:35:32.962
Seriously.
Your message
was received.

01:35:33.173 --> 01:35:35.971
No, look, please,
l don't know what's
going on with me right now.

01:35:36.076 --> 01:35:39.842
Look, it's fine. Don't bother.
Really, what's done is done.

01:35:40.047 --> 01:35:41.537
That's it?
Where are you going?

01:35:41.682 --> 01:35:44.276
That's it! That's it.
That's how this works.

01:35:44.451 --> 01:35:45.440
Come on. l didn't.. .

01:35:45.552 --> 01:35:49.283
For the record, Annie,
you flirted with me.

01:35:49.690 --> 01:35:53.626
You made me feel like
you really liked me,

01:35:53.727 --> 01:35:55.058
which was really unfair.

01:35:55.429 --> 01:35:58.865
And then you came home with me
and we did stuff, fun stuff,

01:36:00.067 --> 01:36:02.331
and then you just left,
just like it was nothing.

01:36:02.903 --> 01:36:06.430
Oh, please. l know
how guys do this thing.

01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:08.007
l know how guys act.

01:36:08.208 --> 01:36:10.733
One minute,
it means something.
The next minute, it doesn't.

01:36:10.878 --> 01:36:11.867
Right, yeah, you've
got it all figured out.

01:36:12.045 --> 01:36:13.069
Yeah.

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:15.842
How is that
working out for you?
Pretty good?

01:36:19.186 --> 01:36:20.346
Boom!

01:36:20.454 --> 01:36:22.752
What's up, fuck-buddy?
You call for some
roadside assistance?

01:36:27.628 --> 01:36:31.155
Thanks, officer.
l can handle it
from here on out.

01:36:36.236 --> 01:36:37.260
Come on!

01:36:38.639 --> 01:36:40.231
l didn't have
anyone else to call!

01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.671
l didn't know that
you were gonna show up!

01:36:41.775 --> 01:36:43.174
That's the problem
with cops, Annie.

01:36:43.343 --> 01:36:44.742
We're just never
there when you need us.

01:36:46.914 --> 01:36:47.903
That cop talks weird.

01:36:54.888 --> 01:36:58.221
TED: Come on, dingus.
Tick-tock. l got shit to do.

01:36:59.293 --> 01:37:01.625
Check it out.
Look what's steering the car.

01:37:07.901 --> 01:37:09.493
Thanks again
for picking me up.

01:37:09.603 --> 01:37:11.070
Not a problem.

01:37:11.672 --> 01:37:13.003
Were you busy?

01:37:13.273 --> 01:37:15.400
Well, it is Friday.

01:37:17.644 --> 01:37:20.340
You know,
you look tired.

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.539
lf you're tired,
you can totally

01:37:22.716 --> 01:37:24.809
lay down in my lap,
if you want.

01:37:25.385 --> 01:37:26.409
What?

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:28.715
Just take a little lap-nap.

01:37:34.995 --> 01:37:36.394
lf you want.

01:37:37.230 --> 01:37:38.595
Open for biz.

01:37:38.799 --> 01:37:40.289
Okay, can you just pull over?

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.400
Yeah, actually,
that's an even better idea.

01:37:42.502 --> 01:37:45.903
No, no, no, can you
please just stop the car?
l want to get out.

01:37:46.006 --> 01:37:47.166
No, it's super gravelly.

01:37:47.274 --> 01:37:49.208
Please pull over!
Why?

01:37:49.309 --> 01:37:51.675
Because l would rather
get murdered out here

01:37:51.778 --> 01:37:53.905
than spend the next
half-an-hour with you.

01:37:54.014 --> 01:37:55.606
Can you please
just pull over?

01:37:56.016 --> 01:37:58.075
Come on, Annie.
lt's called humor.

01:37:58.285 --> 01:38:00.082
Learn about it.

01:38:00.988 --> 01:38:02.888
Besides, l would
never last a half-hour.

01:38:07.461 --> 01:38:08.553
Goodbye, Ted.

01:38:13.133 --> 01:38:15.897
lf you're trying to
turn me on, it's working.

01:38:18.038 --> 01:38:19.630
You used me!

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.105
No big deal.
You are no longer
my number three!

01:38:36.123 --> 01:38:37.249
<i>Wilson!</i>

01:38:40.694 --> 01:38:44.255
<i>Wilson! l'm sorry!</i>

01:38:46.133 --> 01:38:47.998
<i>l'm sorry, Wilson.</i>

01:38:49.002 --> 01:38:51.163
<i>Wilson, l'm sorry!</i>

01:38:51.972 --> 01:38:52.939
<i>l'm sorry!</i>

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.302
Oh, no, Wilson.

01:38:54.508 --> 01:38:55.634
<i>Wilson!</i>

01:38:57.878 --> 01:38:59.505
l'm coming in.

01:38:59.713 --> 01:39:01.681
Let's go, let's go.
And we're walking.

01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:03.980
Okay, we're walking.
Heel. Heel!

01:39:04.418 --> 01:39:06.716
No pee. No!
Not on the carpet!

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:09.047
Okay, we're coming.. .
We're coming in.

01:39:09.156 --> 01:39:11.488
Everybody is in
and having fun.

01:39:11.692 --> 01:39:13.922
We're having fun.
And heel! We're heeling.

01:39:14.661 --> 01:39:15.628
Heel!

01:39:16.096 --> 01:39:17.495
How many of
those did you take?

01:39:17.664 --> 01:39:19.063
l took nine.

01:39:19.266 --> 01:39:20.290
l took nine.

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:25.233
Yeah, l did
slightly over-commit
to the whole dog thing.

01:39:25.338 --> 01:39:28.205
lt turns out, l'm probably
more comfortable with six.

01:39:28.408 --> 01:39:31.468
lt's a lot.. . That's
a lot of energy to deal with.

01:39:31.678 --> 01:39:33.202
But you wouldn't know
anything about that,

01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:34.904
because you haven't
been returning my calls.

01:39:36.616 --> 01:39:38.641
And say what, Megan?

01:39:38.752 --> 01:39:41.687
Say, ''Hi, l can't
get off the couch.

01:39:41.922 --> 01:39:45.358
''l got fired from my job.
l got kicked out
of my apartment.

01:39:45.459 --> 01:39:48.690
''l can't pay any of my bills.
My car is a piece of shit.

01:39:48.795 --> 01:39:51.320
''l don't have any friends.
The last time l.. .' '

01:39:51.431 --> 01:39:53.763
You know what l
find interesting
about that, Annie?

01:39:53.867 --> 01:39:56.802
lt's interesting to me
that you have
absolutely no friends.

01:39:56.903 --> 01:39:58.336
You know why
it's interesting?

01:39:58.538 --> 01:39:59.835
Here's a friend
standing directly

01:40:00.006 --> 01:40:01.337
in front of you,
trying to talk to you.

01:40:01.508 --> 01:40:02.873
And you choose to
talk about the fact

01:40:03.043 --> 01:40:04.442
that you don't
have any friends.

01:40:04.544 --> 01:40:05.875
You know what l mean.

01:40:06.046 --> 01:40:07.411
No, l don't think
you want any help.

01:40:07.514 --> 01:40:09.505
l think you want to
have a little pity party.
That's not true.

01:40:09.616 --> 01:40:11.709
l think Annie wants
a little pity party.

01:40:11.818 --> 01:40:13.843
You're an asshole, Annie!
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

01:40:13.954 --> 01:40:16.514
You're an asshole. l'm life.
ls life bothering you?

01:40:16.623 --> 01:40:17.647
Yes! What are you doing?

01:40:17.824 --> 01:40:18.848
l'm life, Annie.
l'm life, Annie.

01:40:19.092 --> 01:40:21.492
You have got to
fight back on life.

01:40:21.595 --> 01:40:22.789
Megan!

01:40:22.963 --> 01:40:24.191
You better learn to fight.

01:40:24.464 --> 01:40:25.453
Megan!

01:40:25.565 --> 01:40:27.328
l'm life and l'm going
to bite you in the ass!

01:40:29.503 --> 01:40:31.403
Megan.. .
lt's not me.
l'm your life. Turn over!

01:40:31.505 --> 01:40:32.665
My God!

01:40:32.773 --> 01:40:36.641
l'm trying to get you to fight
for your shitty life,
and you won't do it!

01:40:36.743 --> 01:40:37.732
You just won't do it.
Stop it.

01:40:38.011 --> 01:40:40.172
You stop slapping yourself.
Stop slapping yourself.

01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:42.814
l'm your life, Annie.
l'm your shitty.. .

01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:45.218
l'm sorry.

01:40:46.353 --> 01:40:47.320
Nice hit.

01:40:50.157 --> 01:40:51.146
All right.

01:40:51.258 --> 01:40:53.453
l'm glad to see
you've got a little
bit of spark in you.

01:40:54.327 --> 01:40:56.158
l knew that Annie
was in there somewhere.

01:40:56.596 --> 01:40:58.029
l think.. .

01:40:58.231 --> 01:41:01.530
l think you're ready now
to hear a little
story about a girl.

01:41:01.735 --> 01:41:03.726
A girl named Megan.

01:41:03.937 --> 01:41:05.404
A girl named
Megan that didn't have

01:41:05.572 --> 01:41:07.062
a very good time
in high school.

01:41:07.274 --> 01:41:10.300
l'm referring to
myself when l say ''Megan.' '

01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:12.410
lt's me, Megan.
Yeah, l got that.

01:41:12.612 --> 01:41:14.079
l know you look at
me now and think,

01:41:14.181 --> 01:41:16.149
''Boy, she must have
breezed through high school.' '

01:41:16.249 --> 01:41:17.739
Not the case, Annie.

01:41:17.851 --> 01:41:21.685
No, this was not easy
going up and down the halls.
Okay?

01:41:21.788 --> 01:41:23.312
They used to
try to blow me up.

01:41:23.490 --> 01:41:25.014
They threw
firecrackers at my head.

01:41:25.692 --> 01:41:26.659
Firecrackers.

01:41:27.093 --> 01:41:29.493
l mean literally.
l'm not saying
that figuratively.

01:41:29.596 --> 01:41:32.258
l got firecrackers
thrown at my head.
They called me a freak.

01:41:32.833 --> 01:41:34.061
Do you think l
let that break me?

01:41:34.501 --> 01:41:36.765
Do you think l went home
to my mommy, crying,

01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:39.600
''l don't have any friends.
Megan doesn't
have any friends''?

01:41:39.706 --> 01:41:42.072
No, l did not.
You know what l did?

01:41:42.175 --> 01:41:44.666
l pulled myself up,
l studied really hard.

01:41:44.778 --> 01:41:46.905
l read every book in
the library. And now?

01:41:47.013 --> 01:41:48.378
l work for the government.
l have

01:41:48.548 --> 01:41:49.947
the highest possible
security clearance.

01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:51.574
Don't repeat that!
l won't.

01:41:51.685 --> 01:41:52.674
l can't protect you.

01:41:53.019 --> 01:41:55.249
l know where
all the nukes are
and l know the codes.

01:41:57.290 --> 01:41:58.279
l won't say anything.

01:41:58.558 --> 01:42:00.651
You would be amazed.

01:42:00.961 --> 01:42:02.223
A lot of shopping malls.

01:42:02.495 --> 01:42:03.655
Don't repeat that!

01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:05.024
l won't.

01:42:05.232 --> 01:42:06.290
l have six houses.

01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:09.726
l bought an 18-wheeler
a couple of months
ago just because l could.

01:42:09.836 --> 01:42:11.030
Okay, you lost Lillian.

01:42:11.137 --> 01:42:12.434
You got another best friend

01:42:12.539 --> 01:42:14.166
sitting right in front of you,
if you would notice.

01:42:15.141 --> 01:42:16.130
Huh?

01:42:16.243 --> 01:42:17.938
Now, you got to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

01:42:18.645 --> 01:42:20.203
Okay, 'cause l do not
associate with people

01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:21.972
that blame the world
for their problems.

01:42:22.082 --> 01:42:23.811
'Cause you're
your problem, Annie.

01:42:24.017 --> 01:42:26.349
And you're also
your solution.

01:42:27.921 --> 01:42:29.445
Right? l mean, that's.. .

01:42:29.556 --> 01:42:31.649
You get that?

01:42:32.859 --> 01:42:34.292
l just miss her, l guess.

01:42:35.228 --> 01:42:37.321
Yeah, l know you do.

01:42:37.831 --> 01:42:39.731
l know you do.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.134
All right, come on.
Bring it in.

01:42:42.235 --> 01:42:43.634
There's the Annie.. .

01:42:43.737 --> 01:42:45.398
There's the Annie l
knew was there, okay?

01:42:45.572 --> 01:42:47.767
All right.
Man, you have got
to wash your hair.

01:42:47.941 --> 01:42:48.908
l'm sorry.

01:42:49.042 --> 01:42:50.407
You've got to
wash that hair.

01:43:16.102 --> 01:43:17.364
What's wrong?

01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:18.867
Nothing.

01:43:23.877 --> 01:43:24.866
l love you.

01:43:38.425 --> 01:43:40.859
Looks great. Thank you.

01:43:41.127 --> 01:43:44.893
Rhodes and l worked out
a deal way back when,
so it's on the house.

01:43:45.632 --> 01:43:46.690
Are you serious?

01:43:46.933 --> 01:43:49.197
Yeah. l owe him big time.

01:43:49.469 --> 01:43:51.198
That's really nice.

01:43:58.645 --> 01:43:59.873
Hey, Mom?

01:44:02.082 --> 01:44:03.344
This is my mom, Judy.

01:44:03.450 --> 01:44:05.418
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you.

01:44:05.518 --> 01:44:07.418
Good to meet you, too.

01:44:08.455 --> 01:44:10.423
Wait a minute,
don't l know you from AA?

01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:14.089
BlLL COZBl: Oh, my gosh.
You made that artichoke dip,
didn't you?

01:44:14.294 --> 01:44:15.761
lt's good, huh?

01:44:15.862 --> 01:44:16.886
lt's just delicious.

01:45:21.795 --> 01:45:22.784
Come in.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.425
Are you sure
you're not gonna
come with me today?

01:45:29.736 --> 01:45:31.226
lt's Lillian's big day.

01:45:31.337 --> 01:45:33.066
Mom, she doesn't
want me there.

01:45:36.776 --> 01:45:38.710
l'll fix you
a tuna fish sandwich.

01:45:39.045 --> 01:45:40.273
Mom, it's 8:00
in the morning.

01:45:40.447 --> 01:45:41.846
You can put syrup on it.

01:45:51.858 --> 01:45:53.223
l know.

01:45:54.427 --> 01:45:55.394
Hi.

01:45:55.762 --> 01:45:56.786
What do you want?

01:45:56.996 --> 01:45:59.021
l was wondering
if you knew
where Lillian was.

01:45:59.432 --> 01:46:01.332
No, why would l.. .
What do you mean?

01:46:01.734 --> 01:46:04.328
l can't find her.
We've looked everywhere.

01:46:04.537 --> 01:46:05.561
What?

01:46:05.672 --> 01:46:07.833
She is missing.
Can you help?

01:46:08.374 --> 01:46:10.001
Okay, just wait here.
l think l know

01:46:10.176 --> 01:46:11.803
someone that
might be able to help.

01:46:12.045 --> 01:46:14.172
l'll get my keys.
Can l just use.. .

01:46:17.383 --> 01:46:21.251
l mean, l just don't know
what could have
possibly gone wrong.

01:46:21.354 --> 01:46:22.946
Everything was going smoothly.

01:46:23.056 --> 01:46:24.956
The dress looked fantastic.
lt had come in from Paris.

01:46:25.391 --> 01:46:27.586
Dougie was being
great and very helpful.

01:46:27.694 --> 01:46:32.324
l had organized everything
to the last final detail.

01:46:32.432 --> 01:46:33.865
l just.. .

01:46:34.067 --> 01:46:35.659
l don't know
what's happened to her.

01:46:35.935 --> 01:46:38.028
l don't know.
You should know, right?

01:46:38.138 --> 01:46:41.403
You're her best friend.
lt's weird that
you don't know.

01:46:41.608 --> 01:46:42.802
You guys are so close.

01:46:46.946 --> 01:46:50.404
Annie, l want to
apologize to you personally

01:46:50.583 --> 01:46:53.279
for all of the things
that have gone down.

01:46:53.386 --> 01:46:55.320
l know that l hurt you,

01:46:55.421 --> 01:46:57.889
and that l created a distance
between you and Lillian.

01:46:57.991 --> 01:46:59.822
l want to
apologize for that.. .
l don't want to hear.. .

01:46:59.926 --> 01:47:01.416
...and everything
that happened

01:47:01.594 --> 01:47:03.084
at the shower.
And with Las Vegas.. .

01:47:03.196 --> 01:47:04.959
Okay, l don't want
to hear any more,
honestly.

01:47:05.064 --> 01:47:07.123
l don't even
want to talk to you.

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.030
Harry never really
wants to talk to me, either.

01:47:10.136 --> 01:47:12.832
He travels a lot.
Like, all year.

01:47:12.939 --> 01:47:15.533
l'm basically just by myself.

01:47:15.642 --> 01:47:18.634
l don't want to.. .
l don't feel sorry for you.

01:47:19.846 --> 01:47:21.541
l really liked
that original dress

01:47:21.714 --> 01:47:23.409
you picked at
the bridal store.

01:47:23.516 --> 01:47:26.417
l thought it was beautiful.
You have really lovely taste.

01:47:26.519 --> 01:47:29.955
Thanks, but it's
a little too late for that.

01:47:30.156 --> 01:47:31.282
And l know.. .

01:47:31.391 --> 01:47:34.360
l don't think
that Brazilian food
really gave us food poisoning.

01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.427
No, it did.

01:47:35.595 --> 01:47:36.562
No, l don't think it did.

01:47:36.663 --> 01:47:38.631
lt was the food.
l shit my pants
on the way home.

01:47:38.731 --> 01:47:40.130
l don't think it
was your fault.

01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:42.429
That was my fault.

01:47:43.336 --> 01:47:45.964
l think people just
ask me to their weddings

01:47:46.139 --> 01:47:48.767
because l'm good at
organizing parties.

01:47:50.877 --> 01:47:53.573
l don't have any
female friends.

01:47:54.681 --> 01:47:56.148
l'm so sorry.

01:47:56.549 --> 01:47:58.642
Why are you smiling, Annie?

01:47:58.851 --> 01:48:00.478
lt's just.. .
lt's just.. .

01:48:00.687 --> 01:48:03.087
lt's the first time l've
ever seen you look ugly.

01:48:03.289 --> 01:48:05.018
And that makes
me kind of happy.

01:48:05.792 --> 01:48:09.159
l look ugly? No, l don't.
l don't really look ugly.

01:48:09.262 --> 01:48:11.560
A little bit.
You're an ugly crier,
but that's okay.

01:48:11.664 --> 01:48:13.325
No, l'm not really
an ugly crier.

01:48:13.566 --> 01:48:14.999
Maybe just
a little bit.
No.

01:48:15.201 --> 01:48:16.498
Just a little bit.

01:48:17.403 --> 01:48:19.337
lt's just my makeup.

01:48:19.539 --> 01:48:21.530
But l still look pretty good.

01:48:25.178 --> 01:48:26.338
ANNlE: Rhodes!

01:48:27.647 --> 01:48:28.614
Rhodes.

01:48:29.382 --> 01:48:30.644
Rhodes.

01:48:31.818 --> 01:48:33.251
Come on! Rhodes!

01:48:33.586 --> 01:48:35.076
He's ignoring you.
Let me.
Yes, he is.

01:48:35.188 --> 01:48:37.122
Officer!
Roll down your window!

01:48:37.323 --> 01:48:40.190
Excuse me! Please!

01:48:41.261 --> 01:48:43.923
Rhodes,
l know you can hear me,
and l know you're mad at me,

01:48:44.397 --> 01:48:46.729
but l need your help. Please!

01:48:49.602 --> 01:48:51.229
You know this guy?

01:49:00.446 --> 01:49:01.504
What are you doing?

01:49:01.614 --> 01:49:03.206
l just want to
get his attention.

01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:06.575
Annie! Oh, my God.

01:49:09.389 --> 01:49:11.118
ANNlE:
Reckless driving!

01:49:13.459 --> 01:49:17.190
Annie, my hair!
What are you doing?

01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:19.491
l'm speeding!
You better pull me over!

01:49:22.735 --> 01:49:23.724
Really?

01:49:23.936 --> 01:49:25.733
Here comes
the litter-bug!

01:49:30.276 --> 01:49:32.176
Let's see what
Marmaduke's doing.

01:49:32.512 --> 01:49:34.980
Just texting.
Talking on the phone
while l'm driving.

01:49:35.081 --> 01:49:37.515
Not even using my hands.
Oh, hi!

01:49:39.652 --> 01:49:40.619
Mmm! Yum! Yum!

01:49:40.853 --> 01:49:42.320
Beer!

01:49:42.488 --> 01:49:43.455
Yum! Yum! Yum!

01:49:44.257 --> 01:49:45.246
ldiot.

01:49:47.627 --> 01:49:49.458
ANNlE: Hey, what's up, man?

01:49:59.706 --> 01:50:01.799
l don't care. l don't care.

01:50:07.347 --> 01:50:09.941
l'm going to hurl.
l feel really sick, Annie!

01:50:11.718 --> 01:50:13.948
Hey, who's driving that car?

01:50:16.723 --> 01:50:17.747
Can we go up now?

01:50:18.725 --> 01:50:20.556
That's not clever.

01:50:20.927 --> 01:50:21.985
Hey!

01:50:22.095 --> 01:50:23.562
l'm topless!

01:50:24.897 --> 01:50:26.364
l'm totally topless.

01:50:35.975 --> 01:50:37.135
Really?

01:50:39.245 --> 01:50:41.110
Wow. Unbelievable.

01:50:41.481 --> 01:50:43.142
What the fuck are you doing?

01:50:43.349 --> 01:50:44.373
l don't know.

01:50:44.484 --> 01:50:45.974
Hey! Are you crazy?

01:50:46.319 --> 01:50:47.411
Are you crazy?

01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:50.521
All of that stuff,
that would have been
dangerous for a good driver.

01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:53.759
l'm sorry. l just.. .
l really need your help.

01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.052
We can't find Lillian.

01:50:56.496 --> 01:50:57.690
How long has she been gone?

01:50:57.864 --> 01:50:59.058
She's been
missing for 12 hours.

01:50:59.265 --> 01:51:00.493
12 hours?

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:03.191
lt's not a missing person
until it's at least 24 hours.

01:51:03.302 --> 01:51:05.497
Have you ever seen <i>CSl?</i>
24 hours.

01:51:05.972 --> 01:51:08.167
Let me get on
with my job, Annie.

01:51:08.374 --> 01:51:11.070
Nathan, please?

01:51:11.277 --> 01:51:12.301
l really need your help.

01:51:14.414 --> 01:51:15.676
Please, Nathan.

01:51:16.349 --> 01:51:17.316
Who is this one?

01:51:17.784 --> 01:51:18.808
This is Helen.
l'm Helen.

01:51:19.018 --> 01:51:20.144
What?

01:51:20.319 --> 01:51:21.479
lt's Helen.

01:51:21.854 --> 01:51:25.813
Hello, Helen.
l've heard wonderful things.

01:51:29.028 --> 01:51:32.054
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Bye-bye.

01:51:32.265 --> 01:51:33.823
Okay, we've traced
her cell phone

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.558
to the corner of
Craner and Rose.

01:51:36.436 --> 01:51:37.767
Do you know where that is?

01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:39.861
Yes. That is her apartment.

01:51:40.706 --> 01:51:41.832
l thought you said
you looked there.

01:51:42.041 --> 01:51:43.030
We did. We did.
Last night.

01:51:43.209 --> 01:51:44.198
Okay.

01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:47.240
So you're saying
she's at her apartment?
That's what you're telling me?

01:51:47.346 --> 01:51:49.007
She must have gone
back after you left.

01:51:49.115 --> 01:51:50.377
God, that was crazy of her.

01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:51.810
Thank God! Thank you.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:51:51.984 --> 01:51:53.144
Okay.

01:51:56.656 --> 01:51:58.021
We found her!

01:52:01.828 --> 01:52:04.456
l am so sorry.
l didn't mean to
waste your time.

01:52:04.564 --> 01:52:06.327
That's embarrassing.

01:52:07.567 --> 01:52:09.432
Thank you.
No, you are welcome.

01:52:09.535 --> 01:52:11.526
lt's this kind of
high-octane stuff

01:52:11.704 --> 01:52:13.695
that really made me
want to become a cop.

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:16.099
''Missing girl found
at her apartment.' '

01:52:16.309 --> 01:52:17.708
lt's.. .

01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:19.844
lt's adrenalin-pinching.

01:52:22.415 --> 01:52:23.814
lt's nice to see you.

01:52:27.887 --> 01:52:30.651
l'm glad that you got
your taillights fixed.

01:52:30.857 --> 01:52:32.757
Means l won't have
to stop you again.

01:52:37.697 --> 01:52:38.686
Okay.

01:52:40.466 --> 01:52:42.058
Annie, let's go.

01:52:44.103 --> 01:52:46.162
Anyway,
go and save your friend
from her apartment.

01:52:46.839 --> 01:52:48.067
Bye-bye.

01:52:48.274 --> 01:52:49.571
Bye.

01:53:17.603 --> 01:53:20.231
Do you mind actually
if l go by myself?

01:53:21.908 --> 01:53:23.739
Sure.
Okay.

01:53:25.011 --> 01:53:26.569
Lil?

01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:29.213
Lillian?

01:53:31.050 --> 01:53:32.039
Lil?

01:53:32.151 --> 01:53:33.118
LlLLlAN: Go away.

01:53:42.094 --> 01:53:43.118
What happened?

01:53:46.165 --> 01:53:49.259
This whole
wedding is fucked up.

01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:51.899
Helen just took
over everything, and

01:53:54.307 --> 01:53:55.865
everything's got
out of control.

01:53:55.975 --> 01:53:58.842
And my dad can't
afford the wedding.

01:53:59.812 --> 01:54:03.248
This has been really
hard to do without you.

01:54:04.383 --> 01:54:07.250
lt's been shitty.

01:54:09.488 --> 01:54:11.080
l'm sorry.

01:54:12.124 --> 01:54:13.955
Nope. l'm sorry.

01:54:14.493 --> 01:54:16.256
l'm sorry l kicked
you out of my wedding.

01:54:18.097 --> 01:54:19.155
lt's my fault.

01:54:19.265 --> 01:54:20.254
No, it's my fault.

01:54:20.399 --> 01:54:23.266
l think l'm the one
with the mental problems.

01:54:23.536 --> 01:54:24.696
Yeah, wasn't it my
turn to be crazy?

01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:26.064
The bride's
supposed to be crazy.

01:54:26.172 --> 01:54:27.161
Yes, technically.

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:30.136
You kind of
stole all the crazy.
l out-crazied you.

01:54:32.445 --> 01:54:33.844
Everything's
going to be okay.

01:54:34.113 --> 01:54:36.274
Yeah? How do you know that?

01:54:39.318 --> 01:54:41.843
l left the rehearsal
dinner last night.

01:54:42.054 --> 01:54:44.113
l told Dougie l
had to go get Q-tips.

01:54:44.323 --> 01:54:45.688
And

01:54:46.792 --> 01:54:49.886
all of a sudden,
l realized l was
driving here.

01:54:49.996 --> 01:54:51.054
l came here.

01:54:53.799 --> 01:54:57.929
l realized this
is the last time
l'm going to be here

01:54:58.137 --> 01:54:59.798
in this apartment

01:55:00.006 --> 01:55:01.234
with that couch,

01:55:01.641 --> 01:55:02.869
and this bed,

01:55:03.075 --> 01:55:04.940
and take a bath in my bathtub.

01:55:05.144 --> 01:55:06.941
Because you know
how much l love my bathtub.

01:55:07.213 --> 01:55:08.202
lt's a good tub.

01:55:08.314 --> 01:55:10.908
l slept in there on my
30th birthday, remember?
Uh-huh.

01:55:12.018 --> 01:55:13.645
Everything's gonna change.

01:55:15.254 --> 01:55:17.154
l mean, l'm not
going to get to

01:55:17.323 --> 01:55:19.223
live five
minutes away from you.

01:55:22.428 --> 01:55:23.986
And it makes me so sad.

01:55:28.534 --> 01:55:29.501
Well, don't be.

01:55:30.169 --> 01:55:33.104
Don't be sad.
Because things
are going to change,

01:55:33.205 --> 01:55:36.641
but they'll be better.

01:55:38.377 --> 01:55:39.537
You know?

01:55:39.979 --> 01:55:43.506
You're gonna take
this huge, great,
beautiful step.

01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:46.814
And Dougie loves you
more than anything.

01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:49.146
And so do l.

01:55:53.325 --> 01:55:55.953
But what about you?
What's gonna happen to you?

01:56:01.767 --> 01:56:03.962
l'm gonna be fine.

01:56:06.439 --> 01:56:09.135
So don't worry, okay?
l'm gonna be.. .

01:56:09.341 --> 01:56:10.899
l'm gonna be fine.

01:56:11.277 --> 01:56:12.801
l am fine.

01:56:16.449 --> 01:56:19.850
And besides, you need
to blaze the trail for me.

01:56:20.052 --> 01:56:22.953
And then report back
and tell me what's coming.

01:56:23.856 --> 01:56:25.983
Whatever you say, boss.

01:56:28.461 --> 01:56:30.361
All right, let's get
your dress on,

01:56:30.529 --> 01:56:32.463
okay, and let's go
to your wedding.

01:56:34.166 --> 01:56:35.690
Oh, yeah.

01:56:36.602 --> 01:56:37.967
That's the other problem.

01:56:48.414 --> 01:56:52.475
Don't you dare laugh.

01:57:00.426 --> 01:57:01.450
Okay.

01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.721
l cannot wear this dress!

01:57:03.996 --> 01:57:05.486
Okay, don't panic.

01:57:06.699 --> 01:57:08.166
This is a nightmare.

01:57:09.034 --> 01:57:10.524
We'll fix it.

01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:12.360
We'll tweak it.

01:57:13.072 --> 01:57:14.596
l will not let you
walk down that aisle

01:57:14.707 --> 01:57:16.538
unless you look
perfect and beautiful,
l promise.

01:57:16.876 --> 01:57:20.004
Do you have a chainsaw
and a blowtorch?

01:57:22.815 --> 01:57:25.079
l think this wedding
is gonna be a disaster.

01:57:25.184 --> 01:57:26.242
No, don't say that.

01:57:26.652 --> 01:57:28.620
lf Helen had anything
to do with this wedding,

01:57:28.721 --> 01:57:32.282
it is going to be perfect
and tasteful and beautiful.

01:57:32.391 --> 01:57:33.358
That's true.

01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:37.156
MlNlSTER: Will you, Douglas,
take Lillian to be your wife?

01:57:37.429 --> 01:57:40.364
Will you love her,
comfort her, and keep her

01:57:40.533 --> 01:57:43.468
and, forsaking all others,
remain true to her

01:57:43.569 --> 01:57:45.537
as long as you
both shall live?

01:57:45.638 --> 01:57:46.627
l do.

01:57:47.006 --> 01:57:49.531
MlNlSTER: And will you,
Lillian, take Douglas
to be your husband?

01:57:49.642 --> 01:57:51.940
Will you love him,
comfort him, and keep him

01:57:52.144 --> 01:57:53.406
as long as you
both shall live?

01:57:54.747 --> 01:57:56.009
l do.

01:57:57.883 --> 01:58:00.010
MlNlSTER: By the powers
vested in me
by the state of lllinois,

01:58:00.319 --> 01:58:02.048
l pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:58:02.321 --> 01:58:03.379
You may now kiss the bride.

01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:15.790
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:58:15.901 --> 01:58:20.304
here with us tonight is
Lillian's favorite band
singing her favorite song.

01:58:20.506 --> 01:58:24.704
Put your hands
together for
Wilson Phillips!

01:58:29.014 --> 01:58:29.981
Hi, everybody!

01:58:32.518 --> 01:58:33.746
How we doing tonight?

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.220
l am not paying
for this shit.

01:58:38.357 --> 01:58:39.551
Really?

01:58:41.293 --> 01:58:42.624
lt's the last one,
l promise.

01:58:42.728 --> 01:58:44.423
The last one.
The last one.

l put a loaded gun
in Dougie's carry-on.

02:00:43.749 --> 02:00:47.583
The TSA is going to
just rip his ass apart.

02:00:51.457 --> 02:00:52.424
HELEN: Annie?

02:00:54.126 --> 02:00:55.093
Oh. Hey.

02:00:58.564 --> 02:01:00.498

lt was beautiful. Yeah.

02:01:02.968 --> 02:01:05.027

Helen, it was really
nice meeting you, too.

02:01:29.561 --> 02:01:31.188
Hey, you know, maybe

02:01:31.296 --> 02:01:34.891
sometime the three of us
could go to
Rockin' Sushi together.

02:01:36.735 --> 02:01:39.568
Thank you, Annie.

02:01:39.772 --> 02:01:41.433
l would love that.

02:01:47.846 --> 02:01:49.746
Your ride is here.

02:02:06.198 --> 02:02:08.132
Hey, how did everything go?

02:02:10.369 --> 02:02:11.393
Strangely well.

02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:12.594
Good.

02:02:15.641 --> 02:02:17.233
So, l ate your cake

02:02:18.277 --> 02:02:19.676
that you left.

02:02:19.812 --> 02:02:20.779
You did?
Yeah.

02:02:21.046 --> 02:02:22.206
l mean, l had to
fight some raccoons off.

02:02:23.282 --> 02:02:25.443
But that's okay.
l'm pretty strong and tough,

02:02:25.617 --> 02:02:27.778
so it wasn't
much of a contest.

02:02:27.986 --> 02:02:29.044
So that might have been.. .

02:02:29.154 --> 02:02:30.451
l'm just going to
kiss you now
rather than just.. .

02:02:43.502 --> 02:02:44.867
<i>Officer Rhodes,</i>
<i>please report to...</i>

02:02:44.970 --> 02:02:45.937
Oh! l'm on duty.

02:02:46.805 --> 02:02:48.432
And l need to
put my uniform on.

02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:50.405
lf l drive like this,
they're gonna think
l just stole a car,

02:02:50.509 --> 02:02:51.669
which wouldn't be great.

02:02:52.978 --> 02:02:55.310
You could ride
with me if you want.

02:02:55.547 --> 02:02:57.447
You want to come?
Yeah, l do.

02:02:57.716 --> 02:02:58.705
Come on.

02:02:58.817 --> 02:02:59.784
All right.

02:02:59.985 --> 02:03:00.974
Whoa! Whoa!
Where are you going?

02:03:01.153 --> 02:03:02.177
l'm getting in the car.

02:03:02.287 --> 02:03:03.914
No, no, no, you got
to get in the back.
What?

02:03:04.123 --> 02:03:06.250
You can't sit in the front,
it's against regulations.

02:03:06.358 --> 02:03:08.417
Come on. Come on.

02:03:08.627 --> 02:03:10.288
You're going to make
me sit in the back seat?

02:03:10.529 --> 02:03:11.791
Yeah, come on.

02:03:11.897 --> 02:03:12.921
Sorry. Habit.

02:03:13.298 --> 02:03:14.492
All right.

02:03:14.666 --> 02:03:15.860
lt's a force of habit.

02:03:19.671 --> 02:03:21.036
Can l please get
in the front seat?

02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:24.209
Actually, no, l'm afraid
there's a warrant
out for your arrest.

02:03:24.409 --> 02:03:26.036
What? Why?

02:03:26.145 --> 02:03:28.773
Reckless driving,
littering, texting,

02:03:28.981 --> 02:03:30.846
consuming alcohol
while operating a vehicle.

02:03:31.049 --> 02:03:32.073
You didn't
think l was going to

02:03:32.184 --> 02:03:33.742
let you get away
with that, did you?

02:03:34.553 --> 02:03:36.783
Could we put the siren on?
Please?

02:03:39.324 --> 02:03:40.655
