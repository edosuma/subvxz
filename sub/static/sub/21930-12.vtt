WEBVTT

00:03.650 --> 00:04.720
Hey, can you do me a favor?

00:04.750 --> 00:08.189
Can we try to avoid talking
to our friends tonight

00:08.230 --> 00:09.460
about our wedding plans?

00:09.490 --> 00:11.160
I'll do you one better.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.260
I'll avoid talking
to our friends entirely

00:13.300 --> 00:15.430
and play on my phone.

00:15.470 --> 00:18.200
It's just, I haven't picked
a maid of honor yet,

00:18.240 --> 00:21.240
and I'm having trouble deciding
between Penny and Bernadette.

00:21.270 --> 00:22.840
Ah, understandable.

00:22.870 --> 00:24.040
They are quite similar...

00:24.070 --> 00:29.250
both blonde former waitresses
who married beneath them.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.080
Penny is my best friend,

00:31.120 --> 00:32.720
but I was Bernadette's
maid of honor,

00:32.750 --> 00:34.280
and I think
she kind of expects it.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.450
So if anyone brings
it up tonight,

00:36.490 --> 00:38.690
just maybe you can help
me change the subject.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.190
How about this?

00:40.220 --> 00:42.190
I dominate
the conversation so hard,

00:42.230 --> 00:45.100
no one has a chance
to get a word in edgewise.

00:46.460 --> 00:48.330
I don't know.

00:48.370 --> 00:49.870
They might see that coming.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.870
What if we have a code word?

00:51.900 --> 00:54.700
Ooh, now you're speaking
my catamaran.

00:55.910 --> 00:57.810
That's my code word
for "language."

00:57.840 --> 01:00.380
Okay, fine, catamaran.

01:00.410 --> 01:01.710
That's our code word.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.780
No, that's my code word.
Get your own.

01:03.810 --> 01:07.380
Okay. Uh, pretzels.

01:07.420 --> 01:10.290
You hear me say pretzels,
you change the subject.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.120
Rhinos are my least favorite
animals at the zoo.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.690
What?

01:15.730 --> 01:18.260
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought we started.

01:20.260 --> 01:24.230
Hey, just-just hold the gate
still while I screw it in.

01:24.270 --> 01:25.670
You know, I don't
know how I feel

01:25.700 --> 01:26.800
about all this
baby-proofing.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.410
If Halley can't teach herself
to walk down the stairs,

01:29.440 --> 01:30.910
then maybe that's nature's way
of saying

01:30.940 --> 01:33.780
the Wolowitz line ends here.

01:34.740 --> 01:36.150
That's funny.
I always thought

01:36.180 --> 01:37.580
Howard was nature's
way of saying

01:37.610 --> 01:39.650
the Wolowitz line ends here.

01:40.850 --> 01:44.820
Me, too, but life does
find a way!

01:44.850 --> 01:47.860
Hey, Halley can't reach
the liquor cabinet.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.160
Why did you baby-proof it?

01:49.190 --> 01:51.760
How did you know we did?

01:52.960 --> 01:55.130
Fair point.

01:56.430 --> 01:58.740
LEONARD: Bernadette
still going stir-crazy?

01:58.770 --> 02:00.240
Oh, a little.

02:00.270 --> 02:02.210
Two months of bed rest...
it's kind of rough.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.270
Really? That sounds great.
How do I get that?

02:04.310 --> 02:09.410
You'd either have to break your
hip or let Howard knock you up.

02:09.449 --> 02:12.280
Now, either way, you'll get
flowers the next morning.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.950
She's actually been
keeping herself busy

02:14.980 --> 02:17.290
doing wedding research for you.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.960
Oh, she-she doesn't
have to do that.

02:20.990 --> 02:23.930
She wants to. After all,
you were her maid of honor.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.170
Sheldon, tell your funny story
about pretzels.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.370
Oh, right. Yeah, oh, yeah.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.270
Did you know
that we've been thinking

02:34.300 --> 02:36.310
of having pretzels
at our wedding? Hmm?

02:36.340 --> 02:38.440
No, no. No, no, no,
no, no. I'm sorry.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.640
No, rhinos. We're having
rhinos at our wedding.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.250
No! [stammers]
I got to go.

02:47.650 --> 02:49.220
I'm gonna need some help.

02:49.250 --> 02:52.320

Sheldon, what am I gonna do
about my maid of honor?

03:21.350 --> 03:23.920
I mean, Bernadette gave me
all these bridal magazines.

03:23.950 --> 03:26.690
She even folded down the pages
with the good dresses.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.330
Hmm. Hmm.

03:28.360 --> 03:29.590
I get it.

03:29.630 --> 03:32.030
You know, Leonard once borrowed
my Edmund Scientific catalogue

03:32.060 --> 03:33.700
and dog-eared some pages.

03:33.730 --> 03:35.870
Never got 'em straight again.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.270
Well, that is
exactly the same thing.

03:39.300 --> 03:42.440
You really
understand my dilemma.

03:42.470 --> 03:45.040
Actually, I do.
My mother

03:45.070 --> 03:47.980
is pushing for my brother,
Georgie, to be my best man,

03:48.010 --> 03:49.210
and I hate
to disappoint her again.

03:49.250 --> 03:52.350
I already rejected her savior
and her LinkedIn invitation.

03:54.380 --> 03:56.350
How are we gonna
make these decisions

03:56.390 --> 03:58.360
without anybody getting upset?

03:58.390 --> 04:02.760
Well, what if we take emotion
out of the process,

04:02.790 --> 04:05.030
and base it
on empirical metrics?

04:05.060 --> 04:07.700
Then we aren't really
making the decision;

04:07.730 --> 04:09.400
the data is.

04:09.430 --> 04:11.400
So we can hurt our
friends' feelings

04:11.440 --> 04:13.870
without taking any
responsibility?

04:16.610 --> 04:18.540
Me likey.

04:20.410 --> 04:22.410
But how do we apply
quantitative metrics

04:22.450 --> 04:25.080
to something as subjective
as choosing a wedding party?

04:25.110 --> 04:27.620
That decision only
seems subjective.

04:27.650 --> 04:28.790
In reality,

04:28.820 --> 04:31.890
people in a wedding party
perform very specific functions,

04:31.920 --> 04:33.590
and some will perform those
better than others.

04:33.620 --> 04:36.890
If I may use
a superhero analogy...
You may not.

04:36.930 --> 04:38.460
Okay, I'll use real people.

04:38.500 --> 04:42.030
Um, if a certain
dog-like loyalty is useful,

04:42.070 --> 04:44.430
then it's Leonard, hmm?

04:44.470 --> 04:45.900
If, uh, having a PEZ dispenser

04:45.940 --> 04:48.770
filled with TUMS is
an advantage, Wolowitz, yeah.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.680
If a best man
with fake testicles hanging

04:51.710 --> 04:52.940
from his truck is important,

04:52.980 --> 04:55.310
well, then, my brother's
back in the running.

04:56.980 --> 04:58.920
Okay, I see your point.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.120
So we break down
each of the roles

05:01.150 --> 05:02.720
into their component parts,

05:02.750 --> 05:05.490
and then design
specialized tests for each.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.590
Exactly. Boy, if I had known
getting married was going to

05:08.630 --> 05:12.000
involve so much science,
I'd have proposed years ago.

05:14.130 --> 05:16.430
So Leonard,
tell everyone your news.

05:16.470 --> 05:18.840
Oh, oh, I'm starting a book.

05:18.870 --> 05:20.970
That would be big news
from Penny,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.470
but you've read a book before.

05:24.510 --> 05:27.140
He means he's writing a book.

05:27.180 --> 05:30.480
I do. It's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

05:30.510 --> 05:32.380
Yeah. It's about
a brilliant physicist

05:32.420 --> 05:34.880
who solves crimes using science.

05:34.920 --> 05:35.950
Oh, Leonard...

05:35.990 --> 05:37.590
It's not about you.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.930
He probably has to say
that for legal reasons.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.030
WOLOWITZ:
Uh-oh.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.960
They gave us plain rice
instead of fried rice.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.630
Well, no fair!

05:48.670 --> 05:49.870
I SoulCycled this morning.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.500
I'm entitled
to a pile of fat rice.

05:52.540 --> 05:57.570
Well, I would say that this
constitutes a catering crisis.

05:57.610 --> 06:01.480
I agree. Who's gonna
step up and handle it?

06:06.180 --> 06:07.920
Doesn't matter.
This is fine.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.650
[mouths]

06:12.560 --> 06:13.520
Penny?

06:13.560 --> 06:16.130
[mouth full]:
What?

06:17.190 --> 06:18.860
You know what?
I'll take care of it.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.070
[speaks Mandarin]

06:24.000 --> 06:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:35.950 --> 06:37.580
Done.

06:37.610 --> 06:39.850
You didn't make him
feel bad, did you?

06:39.880 --> 06:41.650
Actually, he was laughing.

06:41.690 --> 06:43.450
[laughs]

06:43.490 --> 06:46.190
I'm really impressed
at how you handled that, Howard.

06:46.220 --> 06:47.120
WOLOWITZ:
Please.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.460
I've been sending food
back my entire life.

06:49.490 --> 06:51.060
One of my first
full sentences was,

06:51.090 --> 06:53.500
"I had breast milk
for breakfast."

06:56.500 --> 06:58.200
Excuse me,
b-before we start eating,

06:58.230 --> 07:00.100
I-I would like
to make a toast.

07:00.140 --> 07:01.470
Oh, nice.
Oh, nice.

07:01.510 --> 07:02.810
If only I could think of one.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.040
Someone else go.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.510
Hey. Here's the sewing kit
you asked for.

07:09.550 --> 07:11.010
Ooh! A minute, 19.

07:11.050 --> 07:12.980
Quick.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.620
You were timing me?

07:15.650 --> 07:19.560
Yes. I am going through
a bit of a timing phase.

07:19.590 --> 07:20.990
How long will it last?

07:21.020 --> 07:23.090
We'll find out.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.500
What did you need the kit for?

07:27.100 --> 07:28.130
Oh, um...

07:28.160 --> 07:31.670
Sh-Sheldon was squatting down
to pick up a fork

07:31.700 --> 07:33.200
and he ripped his pants.

07:33.240 --> 07:37.510
Oh, someone's gonna
be sore tomorrow.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.940
[door closes]
Oh, quick thinking.

07:40.980 --> 07:42.280
But for future lies,

07:42.310 --> 07:44.550
this is as far as I can squat.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.950
Penny gets 20 points
for the sewing kit.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.690
Yeah, minus five,

07:50.720 --> 07:52.660
because this is mine.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.290
Well, she's still pulling
a commanding lead.

07:56.330 --> 07:58.900
Did Bernadette even try
to send us a sewing kit?

07:58.930 --> 08:01.260
She did.
Amazon, standard shipping,

08:01.300 --> 08:03.530
not even Prime.
[gasps]

08:03.570 --> 08:04.970
We could've done that ourselves.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.270
[chuckles]
That's what she said.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.240
Maybe we're being
old-fashioned,

08:10.270 --> 08:11.910
defining these roles by gender.

08:11.940 --> 08:14.680
You know, historically,
the best man's role

08:14.710 --> 08:16.710
was to defend the bride
and groom in combat.

08:16.750 --> 08:17.580
I mean, if that's not Penny,

08:17.610 --> 08:20.250
I don't know what
we're doing here.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.220
I see your point.

08:22.250 --> 08:26.220
Okay, we are officially open
to a best woman

08:26.260 --> 08:28.890
and a gentleman of honor.

08:28.930 --> 08:30.260
Oh, those names are terrible.

08:30.290 --> 08:33.130
One point off for you.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.130
What am I being tested for?

08:35.159 --> 08:37.130
Oh, it's not important.
But if you don't pass,

08:37.169 --> 08:38.700
none of this matters.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.610
Okay, what's the next test?

08:42.640 --> 08:43.610
Loyalty.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.840
We need to choose
someone who has our backs,

08:45.880 --> 08:49.250
someone who will keep our
secrets even from each other.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.620
Well, I don't have any secrets
from you.

08:51.650 --> 08:53.150
Do you have secrets from me?

08:53.180 --> 08:56.250
Yes.

08:56.290 --> 08:58.020
Oh, that has been weighing
on me for years.

08:58.050 --> 08:59.290
Come here.

09:02.630 --> 09:06.360
Would you call yourself
a loyal and trustworthy friend?

09:06.400 --> 09:08.670
Yeah, I like to think so.
Great.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.070
Because I need to tell you
something about Howard,

09:11.100 --> 09:13.170
but you can't tell him
that I told you.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.900
Nope. Don't want to hear it.

09:14.940 --> 09:16.370
Do not like to engage in gossip.

09:16.410 --> 09:20.340
Okay. I respect
your integrity.

09:22.150 --> 09:23.350
Is it about
his special underwear?

09:23.380 --> 09:25.680
Because I already know.
And that's all I'll say.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.690
Fine, it has
a charcoal filter in it.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.290
It's really sweet of you
to come by and keep me company.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.330
Agreed. Uh...

09:38.430 --> 09:42.270
So, listen, I have a secret

09:42.300 --> 09:44.300
that I need to tell someone.

09:44.330 --> 09:46.770
But you can never say a word.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.070
Not even to Howard.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.210
I'm your girl. Lay it on me.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.680
Really?

09:51.710 --> 09:54.340
You keep things
from your husband?

09:54.380 --> 09:55.780
No, I tell him everything.

09:55.810 --> 09:57.650
Don't be a child.

09:58.950 --> 10:02.290
Okay. Here it is.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.320
I can control the thermostat

10:04.350 --> 10:06.820
in Leonard's apartment
with my phone.

10:06.860 --> 10:09.930
And when he makes me mad,

10:09.960 --> 10:13.260
I turn it up, slightly.

10:15.730 --> 10:17.730
Oh, hey. I didn't
know you were here.

10:17.770 --> 10:19.640
What are you two talking about?

10:21.270 --> 10:24.370
Literally, nothing interesting.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.910
Oh, you're good.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.420
Okay, getting to
the ceremony on time.

10:34.450 --> 10:36.750
Leonard, quick.
I need you to get me

10:36.790 --> 10:38.320
to Arcadia within the hour.

10:38.350 --> 10:39.760
The train store's having a sale.

10:39.790 --> 10:41.260
Why can't Amy drive you?

10:41.290 --> 10:45.260
Because of the tradition
that I cannot see Amy

10:45.290 --> 10:47.460
on the day of
the train store sale.

10:47.500 --> 10:51.200
Please, please see a doctor.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.700
Next test.
Just wait one second.

10:58.810 --> 11:02.710
Is it getting hot in here?

11:02.750 --> 11:05.210
[laughs]

11:07.220 --> 11:08.990
I'm sorry.
Where were we?

11:09.020 --> 11:11.860
How well do our friends know us?

11:13.220 --> 11:15.390
So I was talking
to my favorite aunt...

11:15.420 --> 11:17.730
Aunt Doe, right?

11:17.760 --> 11:18.930
Exactly.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.800
Did she ever figure out what
that thing on her knee was?

11:21.830 --> 11:24.370
Turns out it was
a chocolate chip.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.940
Hmm. Makes sense,
she does like to bake.

11:27.970 --> 11:32.440
Yes, she does. Damn,
you are a thoroughbred.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.850
You know, dealing with cold feet

11:35.880 --> 11:39.850
is an important part of being
both best man and maid of honor.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.220
Maybe we should test
for that ability.

11:42.250 --> 11:45.520
You really think you
might get cold feet?

11:45.550 --> 11:49.330
Actually, I was
talking about you.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.930
Amy...

11:51.960 --> 11:54.500
if there's one thing in
this world I'm sure of,

11:54.530 --> 11:56.270
you are right to be worried.

11:59.140 --> 12:00.400
Good night.

12:04.210 --> 12:05.270
Howard.

12:05.310 --> 12:09.410
I've had my eye on this
limited edition Swamp Thing,

12:09.450 --> 12:10.450
but now that I'm
about to buy it,

12:10.480 --> 12:13.380
I'm having second thoughts.
What do you think?

12:13.420 --> 12:16.790
I don't know, Sheldon,
it's pretty expensive.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.960
Yes, but what if it will
make me happy, you know,

12:19.990 --> 12:23.830
waking up and seeing it every
morning for the rest of my life?

12:23.860 --> 12:27.500
Really, a walking
clump of swamp grass?

12:27.530 --> 12:30.830
Yeah, well, Bernadette's
no prize either!

12:33.340 --> 12:35.500
Hey, what you doing?
Oh.

12:35.540 --> 12:38.440
Sheldon gave me a brain teaser.
It's kind of fun.

12:38.470 --> 12:39.680
It's about a group
of people at dinner,

12:39.710 --> 12:44.050
and you have to figure out where
they can sit without fighting.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.920
Oh, yeah, is this
the one where Mr. Green

12:45.950 --> 12:48.120
can't sit next to
anyone eating meat,

12:48.150 --> 12:49.120
and Uncle Light Blue

12:49.150 --> 12:51.790
won't sit next to any
of the darker colors?

12:53.420 --> 12:56.060
Yeah, did Sheldon
send it to you?

12:56.090 --> 12:57.460
Amy did. I solved it already.

12:57.490 --> 12:58.390
Really?
Yeah.

12:58.430 --> 13:00.430
Same way I solved
my jury duty summons,

13:00.460 --> 13:01.560
I threw it away.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.570
KOOTHRAPPALI:
No, no, no, no, no.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.900
Uh, Aunt Orange can't
sit next to the bar

13:06.940 --> 13:07.840
without Ms. Pink saying,

13:07.870 --> 13:10.840
"Jesus thinks you've
had enough whiskey."

13:12.010 --> 13:15.010
Did Sheldon and Amy give
you guys that puzzle, too?

13:15.040 --> 13:18.850
Yeah. Is it just me or
have they been acting strange?

13:18.880 --> 13:20.880
I don't think they're acting.

13:22.890 --> 13:24.150
Yeah, the other day,
Sheldon made me

13:24.190 --> 13:25.520
take him to the train store.

13:25.550 --> 13:26.960
We didn't go inside.
He just said,

13:26.990 --> 13:29.590
"Nicely done,"
and then we went home.

13:29.630 --> 13:32.160
Yeah, and Amy gave me
this plastic ring

13:32.200 --> 13:33.900
and told me to hold on to it.

13:33.930 --> 13:34.900
I got one, too.

13:34.930 --> 13:35.600
Yeah, same.

13:35.630 --> 13:37.100
Yeah, me, too.

13:37.130 --> 13:38.830
But-but Cinnamon ate it.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.840
I-I'll get it
back tomorrow.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.110
I have to say, this
is going pretty well.

13:49.150 --> 13:50.150
It is.

13:50.180 --> 13:53.950
I-If experimenting on humans
is morally wrong,

13:53.980 --> 13:56.390
then I don't want
to be morally right.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.620
[door opens]

13:57.650 --> 13:58.990
Hey, are you testing us

13:59.020 --> 14:00.920
to see who gets
to be in your wedding?

14:00.960 --> 14:02.160
Yes.
No.

14:04.090 --> 14:05.930
Wha... they're rating us.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.530
And I'm in last?

14:07.560 --> 14:10.600
Don't panic, there's still time.

14:10.630 --> 14:13.370
Look, it's a marathon,
not a sprint.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.340
You know what,
this is so insulting.

14:15.370 --> 14:17.610
I-I don't even want to be
your stupid best man.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.040
Yeah.
Me neither.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.180
W-W-Wait, wait.

14:20.210 --> 14:23.010
Just out of curiosity,
which one of you figured it out?

14:23.050 --> 14:24.410
I did.

14:25.550 --> 14:27.650
Impressive.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.120
Hello, Stuart.

14:35.160 --> 14:35.930
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.000
Can I interest you
in a cappuccino?

14:39.030 --> 14:40.960
When did you start
selling those?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Oh, someone left it here,
but it's still warm.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.240
Want to say four bucks?

14:48.270 --> 14:50.110
No, thank you.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.110
Oh. Everything okay?

14:52.140 --> 14:53.980
Well...

14:54.010 --> 14:56.110
I secretly experimented
on my friends,

14:56.150 --> 14:59.050
and now none of them
want to be my best man.

14:59.080 --> 15:02.250
So, you know,
normal wedding drama.

15:02.290 --> 15:04.690
Sorry.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.720
Probably have to use
my stupid brother.

15:06.760 --> 15:09.130
So get ready for a wedding toast
delivered by his armpit.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.460
Well, if you really don't
want to use your brother,

15:12.500 --> 15:14.000
I'd be your best man.

15:14.030 --> 15:16.100
Really?

15:16.130 --> 15:19.040
Yeah, we're friends.

15:19.070 --> 15:20.140
Plus, it'd be nice.

15:20.170 --> 15:24.570
Never really been called
the best before.

15:24.610 --> 15:27.410
Or a man, for that matter.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.680
Okay, well, uh,
thank you, Stuart.

15:30.710 --> 15:32.150
That's a very generous offer.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.050
My pleasure.

15:34.080 --> 15:34.980
I-I understand

15:35.020 --> 15:38.220
the best man usually
receives a present.

15:38.250 --> 15:41.060
That's true.

15:42.090 --> 15:44.690
Can never have
too much Claritin.

15:48.730 --> 15:52.000
You're still working on
Sheldon's dumb brain teaser?

15:52.040 --> 15:55.140
Oh, my God, Dr. Purple's
a woman! Of course!

15:56.140 --> 15:58.240
Oh, that feels so good.

15:59.380 --> 16:00.740
Hello.

16:00.780 --> 16:04.110
I believe I owe the
three of you an apology.

16:04.150 --> 16:07.080
No argument here.

16:08.620 --> 16:10.550
By experimenting on you,

16:10.590 --> 16:12.790
I realize I've
violated your trust

16:12.820 --> 16:17.260
and possibly the
Geneva Convention.

16:17.290 --> 16:19.060
Is that it?

16:19.100 --> 16:19.900
No.

16:19.930 --> 16:22.600
So as to not upset
any of you further,

16:22.630 --> 16:24.600
I've asked Stuart
to be my best man,

16:24.630 --> 16:25.570
and he's agreed.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.240
You're all still invited
to the bachelor party.

16:28.270 --> 16:32.540
Uh, he's thinking Costco
and the theme is browsing.

16:32.580 --> 16:35.140
You picked Stuart
over one of us?

16:35.180 --> 16:37.050
Well, I wanted to
choose one of you,

16:37.080 --> 16:38.680
but you all turned against me.

16:38.710 --> 16:42.620
Picking a best man isn't
about keeping score.

16:42.650 --> 16:44.350
But you're all my friends.

16:44.390 --> 16:45.720
I mean,
if I didn't collect data,

16:45.750 --> 16:47.820
how could I possibly choose
among the three of you?

16:47.860 --> 16:50.790
Well, that's actually
kind of sweet.

16:50.830 --> 16:54.330
Is it? Perhaps I said it wrong.

16:54.360 --> 16:58.330
Look, this is your wedding,
just pick whoever you want.

16:58.370 --> 17:01.070
You don't need to worry
about anyone else but yourself.

17:01.100 --> 17:04.140
You've kind of been training
for this your whole life.

17:04.170 --> 17:06.109
Thank you, Leonard.

17:06.140 --> 17:09.150
And if it helps...
these two are quitters.

17:12.150 --> 17:14.579
[keys jingle]
Hey, what you making?

17:14.619 --> 17:16.450
Uh, well, I spilled
the cheese packet,

17:16.490 --> 17:19.819
so we're having mac and nothing.
Oh.

17:19.859 --> 17:21.790
Yeah. I'll just have the mac.

17:21.819 --> 17:23.690
"Nothing" gives me gas.
[chuckles]

17:26.900 --> 17:29.100
Why are you in such a good mood?

17:29.130 --> 17:30.370
Mm, I just talked to Sheldon.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.200
He apologized about the tests
and asked me to be his best man.

17:33.240 --> 17:36.610
Uh, great. After all you've done
for him, he should've asked you.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.110
And Amy's your best friend.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.210
I'm sure she'll come
to her senses and pick you.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.150
Okay, she's not my best friend.
We're not 12.

17:42.180 --> 17:43.850
If she wants Bernadette
to be her maid of honor,

17:43.880 --> 17:44.850
I really don't care.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.580
Sounds like you care.

17:46.620 --> 17:47.820
No, I mean, it-it's
just annoying.

17:47.850 --> 17:50.690
You know, we talk every day.
We see each other all the time.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.120
She's always there
for me, and basically...

17:52.160 --> 17:54.760
oh, my God, Amy's
my best friend.

17:56.260 --> 17:58.160
You okay?

17:58.190 --> 18:02.230
No, my best friend didn't ask
me to be her maid of honor.

18:02.270 --> 18:03.300
I'm pissed!

18:05.800 --> 18:09.910
So, bottom line, what you
did was wrong and cruel,

18:09.940 --> 18:15.140
which the mother of my children
finds oddly appealing.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.510
So she still wants
to be my maid of honor?

18:17.550 --> 18:19.620
Maid of honor, hit woman,
whatever you need.

18:19.650 --> 18:21.850
Make the call.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.150
Look, I know this
is your wedding,

18:23.190 --> 18:24.450
and you can do
whatever you want,

18:24.490 --> 18:27.360
but if you think anyone but me
is gonna be your maid of honor,

18:27.390 --> 18:30.730
then you're an idiot because
you are my best friend.

18:30.760 --> 18:31.730
Too late. Bernade...

18:31.760 --> 18:33.200
Bestie!

18:40.740 --> 18:42.870
Stuart, I'm sorry if it's weird

18:42.910 --> 18:45.210
Sheldon made me best man
instead of you.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.040
It's okay.

18:46.070 --> 18:49.210
I was best man
for two whole days.

18:51.210 --> 18:53.180
No one can take that
away from me.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.190
Except for Sheldon, when he did.

18:58.890 --> 19:00.560
Although, if you
want to be a part

19:00.590 --> 19:01.420
of the wedding party,

19:01.460 --> 19:04.730
I suppose you could be
the flower girl.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.660
Sold.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.730
Well, I thought Halley
was gonna be the flower girl.

19:11.770 --> 19:13.200
Oh, that's much better.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.170
Sorry, Stuart, you're out.

19:16.970 --> 19:19.440
Hey, so is Bernadette okay
with me being maid of honor?

19:19.480 --> 19:22.950
Actually, I haven't
had the courage to tell her.

19:22.980 --> 19:25.210
I guess I should do that.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.880
Uh, yeah.
[clears throat]

19:29.020 --> 19:31.220
Although, as maid of honor,

19:31.250 --> 19:32.820
your job is to
make my life easier.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.960
[groans]
Damn it.

19:35.990 --> 19:39.190
Hey, Stuart, you still
want in on this wedding?

19:40.900 --> 19:44.230
Not that much.

19:44.270 --> 19:47.340
[sighs]
Fine, I'll do it.

19:47.370 --> 19:50.240
But do me a favor and unlock
the liquor cabinet first.
