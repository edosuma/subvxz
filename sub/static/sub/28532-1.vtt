Taxi!

02:43.706 --> 02:45.374
Taxi!

04:14.588 --> 04:16.173
Okay, okay.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.267
Ohh. Ohyo.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.001
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.066
Bye.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.943
Bye, Bubu.

05:18.110 --> 05:21.613
Baba, goodbye. Bye, bye!

06:54.915 --> 06:58.085
More hot water.
Make it 48 degrees, exactly 48.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.256
- What is this?
- What?

07:02.423 --> 07:05.050
A blue jumpsuit. It's a boy.
Blue, blue!

07:05.217 --> 07:07.970
Um, but Sanjay said it's a girl.

07:08.137 --> 07:09.555
The baby in 440, boy or girl?

07:09.721 --> 07:11.849
Zahra Kashani, did she have
a boy or girl?

07:12.015 --> 07:13.892
- Boy.
- Girl.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.228
Put one of each.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.578
Dilip? Dilip?
Where am I tonight?

07:32.744 --> 07:34.955
Shamiana. Shamiana Restaurant.

07:35.122 --> 07:38.250
Yeah, okay. Thank you very much.
I'll call. Bye.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.961
Prahba? We have another
VIP guest on the way.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.046
Mrs Kashani's daughter's
arriving shortly.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.257
<i>Zahra Kashani.</i>

07:45.424 --> 07:47.092
<i>She's just had a child
with an American.</i>

07:47.259 --> 07:49.052
- He's just sleepy.
<i>- David Duncan.</i>

07:49.219 --> 07:51.388
- Hey, how far to the hotel?
<i>- He's an architect.</i>

07:51.555 --> 07:53.599
- About two blocks, sir.
- Perfect, thank you.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.309
I think it's like 45 minutes?

07:55.476 --> 07:56.602
<i>Their suite is ready</i>

07:56.768 --> 07:58.437
<i>so head to the main lobby
and greet them.</i>

07:58.604 --> 08:00.939
<i>They should be arriving
any minute now.</i>

08:05.611 --> 08:06.653
Namaste.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.363
<i>Congratulate them
on the baby</i>

08:08.530 --> 08:10.199
<i>but do not mention the wedding.</i>

08:10.365 --> 08:12.034
<i>They're not married?</i>

08:12.201 --> 08:14.495
<i>They are, but Zahra was
already pregnant</i>

08:14.661 --> 08:16.872
<i>so the mother insisted
on a private ceremony.</i>

08:17.039 --> 08:18.373
<i>No publicity.</i>

08:18.540 --> 08:20.167
Oh, wow!

08:25.172 --> 08:26.298
- Hello.
- Namaste.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.465
- How are you, Prahba?
- Splendid to have you back.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.676
- Oh, thank you.
- Namaste.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.678
And this is Sally,
our nanny.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.179
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.847
Namaste.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.851
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.770
- And welcome. Namaste.
- Namaste.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.395
- Thank you.
- This is cool.

08:42.648 --> 08:45.442
- We hope you have a good stay.
- Thank you. Thanks, Prahba.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.945
And so, please,
if you'd follow me.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.241
Everything that you ordered
has been placed

08:52.407 --> 08:54.618
but if you need anything else,
please feel free to ask.

08:54.785 --> 08:55.827
<i>Prahba?</i>

08:55.994 --> 08:57.496
Nisha's taking them up now, sir.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.373
<i>Have you booked
their dinner reservations?</i>

08:59.540 --> 09:00.958
Yes, sir. 9pm at the Shamiana.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.502
<i>Just book a table for
them in all our restaurants.</i>

09:03.669 --> 09:05.509
<i>If she changes her mind
and we don't have room,</i>

09:05.587 --> 09:07.047
<i>her mother is going to kill me.</i>

09:07.214 --> 09:08.549
<i>Doing it now, sir.</i>

09:08.715 --> 09:10.717
This way.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.970
Welcome back to the Taj!

09:13.136 --> 09:14.263
Wow!

09:14.429 --> 09:16.473
I've drawn a bath just
to your liking, 48 degrees.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.850
Thank you, Jomon,
that's too kind.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.270
- Oh, look at that!
- Where's my little boy?

09:21.436 --> 09:23.939
- Want to go see Mum?
- Hello, my gorgeous boy. Yes!

09:28.026 --> 09:30.404
- My God, how cute is this?
- Champagne!

09:30.571 --> 09:32.197
I still think he's a bit warm.

09:32.364 --> 09:35.409
- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.411
- Hey, baby, where's the...
- Corner cupboard.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.579
Corner cupboard.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.582
Shall I call a doctor,
just to be on the safe side?

09:41.748 --> 09:44.042
Yeah. Just to be
on the safe side.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.128
And your 9pm reservation
at the Shamiana?

09:46.295 --> 09:47.796
I don't know. What do you think?

09:47.963 --> 09:49.381
You want to just get
room service?

09:49.548 --> 09:51.133
Oh, no, no, you two should go.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.140
You could always nip back up
when he gets here.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.179
I'll keep your reservation and
you come at your convenience

09:56.346 --> 09:58.056
or not, as you wish.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.725
Thank you, Jomon.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.352
Let's go.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.146
You're my sweets.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.187
Come on. I'm going to go change.
Let's go to dinner.

10:07.316 --> 10:10.110
Naughty Daddy, naughty.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.821
There's a whole 'nother room
back here.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.406
What's going on?

11:57.926 --> 11:58.969
Hands.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.896
Very good.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.358
Turn around.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.945
Okay, good. Very good.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.531
Show me your socks.

12:21.450 --> 12:24.411
Mm. Okay, relax.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.205
You need a neat cut,
not this stretching down.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.791
Good. Nice. Relax.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.835
Good.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.680
Is this a joke?

12:43.847 --> 12:46.183
Forgive me, sir,
I... I lost my shoes.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.602
They must have fallen
from my bag.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.855
Go home, Arjun.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.607
Everyone else, let's move.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.318
- Sir, sir, please.
- Please what?

12:56.485 --> 12:57.986
You look like a beggar.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.238
Sir, please, I'll find some
shoes. I need this shift.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.365
You need to leave.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.409
Sir. Sir, please.

13:04.576 --> 13:08.038
My wife's going to give birth
any day now.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.873
Please.

13:11.917 --> 13:15.337
There's an extra pair of shoes
in my room.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.130
Under the desk.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.633
- Thank you, sir.
- Hurry up!

13:22.552 --> 13:25.305
<i>..metropolis built
across seven islands</i>

13:25.472 --> 13:28.433
<i>on the edge of the Arabian Sea.</i>

13:28.600 --> 13:30.852
<i>Here in India's wealthiest city</i>

13:31.019 --> 13:36.191
<i>rises majestically the 5-star

<i>Experience for yourself

<i>Armed gunmen have

13:51.414 --> 13:53.166
<i>Mumbai's main railway terminal,</i>

<i>gunning down more than
100 passengers and staff.</i>

13:56.628 --> 13:59.172
<i>Security cameras captured
images of these two suspects</i>

13:59.339 --> 14:02.008
<i>who fled the scene,
firing at pedestrians and...</i>

15:05.280 --> 15:07.198
<i>The biggest worry at
this point in time</i>

15:07.365 --> 15:09.868
<i>is that there is a fear
amongst the cops</i>

15:10.035 --> 15:13.121
<i>who are still trying to figure
out the source of the firing</i>

15:13.288 --> 15:15.665
<i>and if a police car
has been hijacked</i>

15:15.832 --> 15:18.460
<i>by the perpetrators
of this gun battle.</i>

15:18.627 --> 15:20.545
<i>This is the biggest fear</i>

15:20.712 --> 15:22.631
<i>right now in the minds
of the police because</i>

15:22.797 --> 15:25.342
<i>there was a point where
there... there came a car...</i>

15:31.181 --> 15:34.267
<i>Well, there you saw,
you saw a police van,</i>

15:34.434 --> 15:38.355
<i>a police Toyota Qualis
being driven...</i>

15:39.648 --> 15:41.524
<i>..and indiscriminate fire.</i>

15:57.749 --> 16:00.710
So, these are for the Sindhi
wedding in the Ocean Room.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.213
The kimchis are for the
trade delegation in Wasabi.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.674
The MPs are already
at the Harbour Bar, quite drunk.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.926
Mm-hm.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.177
More lemongrass, huh?

16:09.344 --> 16:10.762
Arjun!

16:12.305 --> 16:13.473
Stop limping.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.850
Yeah, more lemongrass.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.437
- What about the Russian?
- Booked into the Shamiana, sir.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.398
He has party later,
he wants help.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.400
Okay, everyone.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.652
Everyone listen in, please,
come on. Leave that.

16:25.819 --> 16:30.365
Come on, come here, come here.
Yes. Okay, come on, hurry up.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.284
Yep.

16:35.704 --> 16:36.913
So...

16:38.081 --> 16:41.167
<i>..we have another VIP guest
dining at the Shamiana tonight,</i>

16:41.334 --> 16:43.086
<i>Vasili Gordetsky.</i>

16:43.253 --> 16:44.713
- Sir.
<i>- He can be difficult.</i>

16:44.879 --> 16:47.048
Mr Gordetsky,
so nice to see you again.

16:47.215 --> 16:50.719
<i>Whatever he says,
just smile, be polite...</i>

16:50.885 --> 16:52.345
<i>..be courteous.</i>

16:52.512 --> 16:57.767
Remember always,
here at the Taj, guest is God.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.561
<i>Under no circumstances</i>

16:59.728 --> 17:01.604
<i>you are to recommend seafood
to him.</i>

17:01.771 --> 17:04.107
<i>He's allergic to it.</i>

17:04.273 --> 17:09.529
<i>Never, ever serve him drink
in a glass, always a bottle.</i>

17:09.695 --> 17:11.175
<i>And make sure that you open
the bottle</i>

17:11.321 --> 17:13.407
<i>in front of him, directly.</i>

17:37.682 --> 17:41.811
The tall one. She has
big nipples or small nipples?

17:43.813 --> 17:46.941
Good. Okay, send them both.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.194
Who speaks like that?

17:51.446 --> 17:52.864
<i>After dinner,</i>

17:53.031 --> 17:56.451
Mr Gordetsky's having
a private party in his suite.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.244
He will need a waiter.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.121
Of course there will be
large tips.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.415
- Sir? Olga speaks Russian.
- No.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.292
Never a female staff.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.252
We can't have a repeat
of last time.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.837
Sir, I would be honoured
to serve.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.506
No, thank you, Arjun.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.299
Sir, please, I'll ensure that...

18:11.466 --> 18:14.385
You will ensure that you arrive
in the proper footwear.

18:16.930 --> 18:20.767
Sanjay, you will serve
at the Russian's party tonight.

18:20.934 --> 18:24.312
Go to Elia's and get two bottles
of Vernier Dejeune.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.815
- Wanjidon. Thank you, sir.
- Hold on. What did you say?

18:26.981 --> 18:29.359
Wanjidon? What is Wanjidon?

18:29.526 --> 18:31.694
It's Vernier Dejeune.

18:31.861 --> 18:32.862
Verdijan?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.489
It is Vernier Dejeune.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.658
- With 'V'.
- 'V'. Verrrr...

18:36.825 --> 18:39.202
- With 'V'. Vernier Dejeune.
- 'V'...

18:39.369 --> 18:41.579
Don't repeat 'V'.
Just say Vernier Dejeune!

18:41.746 --> 18:43.706
- 'V'...
- Not 'V', Vernier Dejeune!

18:43.873 --> 18:46.209
Wanjidon!

18:46.376 --> 18:49.045
Vernier Dejeune.
It's a cognac.

18:49.212 --> 18:50.212
Go!

18:50.338 --> 18:52.048
Wanjidon. Wanjidon.
Thank you, sir.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.299
Wanjidon.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.163
You won't believe
the kind of women

19:23.329 --> 19:24.581
he's got coming over tonight.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.040
The Russian guy, yeah.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.043
Ha. I heard they're knockouts.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.962
Ten out of ten, man!

19:31.129 --> 19:35.175
Yeah. Coming in an hour. Yeah.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.218
Oi!

19:48.813 --> 19:50.857
What are you looking at?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.901
Go.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.861
Go!

19:56.863 --> 20:00.033
Check these
dudes out. He's going off, look!

20:00.200 --> 20:01.534
They are going nuts!

20:01.701 --> 20:04.162
Look at him, look at
the little angry butler!

20:04.329 --> 20:06.831
- Look at him! Check him out!
- Babe, babe, hi. Eddie!

20:06.998 --> 20:08.708
I'm putting money
on the little butler man.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.586
- Taj.
- Taj. Yes, let's go.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.004
- Alright.
- Let's go.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.340
We're going to the Taj.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.383
We're going to the Taj.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.261
Um, hang on. Let's go...
Ah, excuse me, sir.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.890
- Namaste, mate.
- Namaste.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.184
Um, I think we've got
a little problem here

20:26.351 --> 20:29.479
because we didn't order
this pork thing.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.481
Yes.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.775
No. No, no, no, no.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.818
I don't think so
because if you just look here,

20:35.985 --> 20:37.528
we didn't actually...

20:42.659 --> 20:44.702
Fuck. Bree, get down!

21:55.106 --> 21:57.108
This way.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.652
Come on! Come on,
come on, go! Go!

21:59.819 --> 22:01.029
Run!

22:01.195 --> 22:03.614
Go, babe. Go!

22:04.782 --> 22:07.744
Come on, go. Come on! Come on!

22:07.910 --> 22:10.872
- Are you hurt?
- I don't know. Don't think so.

22:22.175 --> 22:26.346
If I may, ahh, 2003 was
a very good year for Bordeaux

22:26.512 --> 22:29.265
due to the exceptional heat wave
that year.

22:29.432 --> 22:32.894
Ah, the Château Latour there,
amazing depth,

22:33.061 --> 22:35.438
powerful yet silky dark fruit.

22:35.605 --> 22:37.732
A seamless finish,
it's a very good wine.

22:37.899 --> 22:39.984
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.571
Um...

22:43.738 --> 22:47.158
You know, why don't you just
bring me a JD and Diet Coke?

22:47.325 --> 22:49.285
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:49.452 --> 22:50.912
And you know what?

22:51.079 --> 22:52.914
Bring us a cheeseburger,
for old times' sake.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.582
Chicken or fish, sir?

22:54.749 --> 22:56.334
No, just a regular burger. Beef.

22:56.501 --> 22:59.253
Oh. They don't have beef here.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.255
Yeah, they got everything here.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.132
Honey, cows are sacred in India.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.010
I am so sorry,
I completely spaced.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.470
It's OK.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.847
OK, so what do you recommend?
What's...

23:10.014 --> 23:11.808
The lamb kofta is
very popular...

23:11.974 --> 23:12.974
Hey, Sally.

23:13.101 --> 23:14.852
Hey, Zahra.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.687
No, I've just checked in
with reception.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.689
They said the doctor's
still on their way.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.235
No, no, he's more than fine.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.530
Yeah, he had a big feed
and I just put him down.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.659
Sure, I'll call you then.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.661
But, really, we're all good.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.539
OK.

23:34.705 --> 23:37.083
Enjoy.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.821
- Good evening, Taj Palace Hotel.
- Hi, there.

24:06.988 --> 24:09.240
Just checking about the doctor.

24:09.407 --> 24:10.992
OK, so next trip,
I have an idea,

24:11.159 --> 24:12.618
let's go, just the two of us.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.203
Yeah, I'd like that.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.456
Bree! Go!

24:17.915 --> 24:18.958
Bree, run!

24:19.917 --> 24:22.170

24:31.262 --> 24:33.055
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait!
Wait!

24:40.605 --> 24:42.356
Door, man,
just fucking open the door!

24:44.317 --> 24:46.944
Security.
Can we get security now?

24:47.111 --> 24:49.322
Dilip, look.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.659
We've got a reservation, mate.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.746
Let them in!
It's OK, let them all in.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.998
Bree, Bree.
Thank you, thank you.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.550
Bree, come on.
Excuse me.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.427
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Lani, is it?

26:13.114 --> 26:14.907
Sir, I have no record
of your booking.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.493
- Please, if we could just...
- Sir...

26:17.660 --> 26:20.079
Listen, can we just please
call our family?

26:41.892 --> 26:44.186
Lights. Switch off the lights.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.315
Down. Down. Everyone down! Down.

26:48.482 --> 26:49.775
Please. Under the tables. Down.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.238
Bree!

26:58.618 --> 26:59.910
No, no, no.

- Sir, down!

27:09.587 --> 27:11.227
- They have machine guns.
- You must hide!

27:42.495 --> 27:44.914
Go.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.721
It's okay, it's okay.

There's a security issue, here.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.264
No, please don't leave
your room, sir.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.475
I'll be in touch, sir.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.059
Yes, yes.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.536
Room service!

Sh, sh, sh. Sorry, what?

30:30.913 --> 30:32.581
- Where's Cameron?
- Where's Cameron?

30:32.748 --> 30:34.667
The doctor's here now.

30:34.834 --> 30:38.045
Just a second. Sorry, it keeps
breaking up, I can't hear you.

Where's Cameron?

35:07.481 --> 35:09.483
There were men with guns,
just boys.

35:09.650 --> 35:11.443
They came in but we hid.
Shhhh.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.113
<i>- They came in our room?
- Oh, my God, David.</i>

35:15.572 --> 35:18.492

Okay, okay.
You stay right where you are.

35:20.911 --> 35:23.997

35:34.341 --> 35:36.635
I need you to be strong, okay?

35:37.678 --> 35:39.471

We need the police right now.
Right now.

35:43.851 --> 35:45.853
We've called you five times.
Please send someone.

35:46.937 --> 35:49.356
- Sir, please, please.
- My kid's upstairs.

35:49.523 --> 35:52.276

Please, sir. Please, sir.

35:53.402 --> 35:55.612
- Do you have a family?
- Yes, sir.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.614
And I hope to stay alive
and see them.

35:57.781 --> 35:59.992

- No, no, sir. You cannot...

36:00.159 --> 36:01.618
- I need to piss.
- You can't.

36:01.785 --> 36:02.828
I need to piss!

36:09.042 --> 36:10.460
- I need to pee!
- Sir.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.462

Will you message Zahra for me?

41:32.073 --> 41:33.492
Can you tell her
we made it okay?

41:35.494 --> 41:37.787
Yeah.

41:37.954 --> 41:40.665
It's okay.

41:40.832 --> 41:44.002
It's okay, it's okay. Shhhh.

44:36.007 --> 44:39.260
Yes. Sixth floor.

44:39.427 --> 44:41.471
Okay, Arjun.

44:41.638 --> 44:43.807
Okay. Call me

44:53.066 --> 44:55.527
But our guests are trapped
all through the hotel.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.322
I think we should try and gather
whoever we can

44:59.489 --> 45:02.951
and take them
to the Chambers Lounge

45:03.118 --> 45:04.703

45:04.869 --> 45:06.788
Sir, Olga made it
through the back exit.

45:06.955 --> 45:08.540
We can do the same.

45:08.707 --> 45:10.917
Yes, but our guests can't.

45:11.084 --> 45:12.627
Not all of them.

45:17.048 --> 45:20.510
- Sir, I have four kids at home.
- I know, Dilip.

45:21.970 --> 45:23.972
Nobody's forcing you to stay.

45:26.808 --> 45:29.477
So whoever wants to try
and make it out...

45:31.229 --> 45:33.523
..this is your time.

45:35.108 --> 45:36.901

45:37.068 --> 45:39.070
Don't apologise.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.322
Go.

45:54.836 --> 45:57.213
Many of you have wives...

45:58.715 --> 46:02.177
..parents,
families at home.

46:02.343 --> 46:04.596
There is no shame in leaving.

Follow me.

46:31.623 --> 46:35.084

46:45.178 --> 46:47.258
He says we should come upstairs

46:47.388 --> 46:50.600
- We'll be safer there.
- Why? You know something?

46:50.767 --> 46:52.811
How many there are,
where they are?

46:52.977 --> 46:54.354
I'm not sure, sir,

46:54.521 --> 46:56.582
but the Chambers is the most
secure place in the hotel.

46:56.606 --> 46:58.483
I know what
the fucking Chambers is.

46:58.650 --> 47:00.527
Is the passage clear?

47:00.693 --> 47:03.822
Yes, sir. We'll go
via the service stairs.

47:03.988 --> 47:05.615
We'll leave
in a couple of minutes, okay?

47:43.486 --> 47:47.615
No, I know. I'm safe

49:10.949 --> 49:13.284
Come, come.

49:21.876 --> 49:23.670
Come, come.

50:13.011 --> 50:16.514
Mr Oberoi, sir, are you there?

50:16.681 --> 50:18.808
Sir?

50:20.018 --> 50:22.520
Sir? Sir, it's me Arjun,
from Shamiana.

50:22.687 --> 50:24.188
Okay.

50:28.067 --> 50:29.527
Arjun.

50:30.695 --> 50:33.031
Please come. Come, come.

50:33.197 --> 50:35.158
Nothing to fear.
Please come.

50:35.324 --> 50:37.035
Yes. Please.

50:39.287 --> 50:40.830
Hi.

50:40.997 --> 50:42.707
How are you, sir?

50:42.874 --> 50:44.542
It's okay. Everything's fine.

50:44.709 --> 50:46.127
Have a drink inside.

50:46.294 --> 50:47.920
Mr Vasili, how are you?

50:49.172 --> 50:50.715
Come, come this way.

50:52.425 --> 50:55.344
Please, please, this way.
Take a seat.

50:55.511 --> 50:58.014
You have water?

50:58.181 --> 50:59.640
- Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
- Jomon!

50:59.807 --> 51:02.143
I'm so sorry.
Everything will be fine now.

51:02.310 --> 51:05.021
You're totally safe.
Sit anywhere you like, okay?

51:05.188 --> 51:06.481
No problem.

51:06.647 --> 51:08.024
Please, please.

51:08.191 --> 51:11.903
- Can I help you, sir?
- I'd like a cognac.

51:12.070 --> 51:13.780
- Vernier Dejeune.
- Of course, sir.

51:15.364 --> 51:16.866
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

51:18.242 --> 51:19.786
Take a seat, sir.

51:34.008 --> 51:35.802
Ladies and gentlemen,

51:35.968 --> 51:37.678
may I have your attention,
please?

51:37.845 --> 51:39.931
Can you come closer?
Arjun, can you just help them?

51:40.098 --> 51:42.642
A little further. I don't want
to speak loudly, please.

51:42.809 --> 51:45.311
Can you come closer, sir?
Sir, ma'am? Please?

51:45.478 --> 51:47.188
Sir, can you come forward,
please?

51:47.355 --> 51:48.648
Thank you.

51:52.944 --> 51:57.115
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Hemant Oberoi,

51:57.281 --> 51:59.117
head chef here at the Taj.

51:59.283 --> 52:01.452
We are all terribly sorry

52:01.619 --> 52:04.872
for everything you've
had to endure here tonight.

52:05.039 --> 52:09.293
But please be rest assured
the worst is behind us now.

52:10.837 --> 52:12.964
The Chambers is
an exclusive club,

52:13.131 --> 52:15.842
very difficult to access.

52:16.008 --> 52:18.177
As you can see, there are
no internal windows

52:18.344 --> 52:20.805
and every entrance
has been secured.

52:20.972 --> 52:25.685
We will be safe here until
police comes and fetches us.

52:25.852 --> 52:27.979
- When will that be?
- What's taking so long?

52:28.146 --> 52:32.316
Ma'am, they're outside right
now. It's just a matter of time.

52:34.193 --> 52:37.822
Yes, what's important is that
we remain calm and quiet

52:37.989 --> 52:41.159
because we want our position
to remain a secret.

52:44.120 --> 52:46.205
REPORTER, TV:
<i>The situation inside the hotel</i>

52:46.372 --> 52:47.832
<i>is becoming utterly desperate.</i>

52:47.999 --> 52:49.667
<i>Footage just in of this man,</i>

52:49.834 --> 52:51.502
<i>forced to flee on a rope...</i>

52:51.669 --> 52:53.296
Come on. We should get going.

52:54.463 --> 52:55.590
Going where?

52:55.756 --> 52:56.757
Staff's moving everybody

52:56.924 --> 52:58.684
up to the Chambers Lounge
on the sixth floor.

52:58.801 --> 53:00.595
- They said it'll be safer.
- No way.

53:00.761 --> 53:02.305
Sally, come on.

53:02.471 --> 53:04.473
You can go.
I'm not going anywhere.

53:06.434 --> 53:08.662
David, there are men with guns
killing people in the hallway.

53:08.686 --> 53:10.730
There's no way
that I'm going out there.

53:10.897 --> 53:14.567
I know. And Zahra's out there
and she's by herself.

53:14.734 --> 53:16.861
They came in here and they
fucking shot her, David,

53:17.028 --> 53:18.696
like a fucking rabbit

53:18.863 --> 53:20.656
and if we move
and if the baby wakes

53:20.823 --> 53:23.117
- they're going to shoot us too.
- Okay, okay.

53:25.870 --> 53:27.580
I mean, the cops are already
outside.

53:27.747 --> 53:29.707
Can't we just wait for them
to come and get us?

53:35.504 --> 53:37.423
Yep. Okay.

54:25.388 --> 54:27.598
Kanu!

54:28.766 --> 54:29.976
Kanu!

54:31.185 --> 54:32.436
Kanu!

54:42.321 --> 54:44.240
<i>It's been a night and a morning</i>

54:44.407 --> 54:46.450
<i>of gun battles in Mumbai.</i>

54:46.617 --> 54:49.161
<i>Perhaps never before has a city
been attacked</i>

54:49.328 --> 54:53.457
<i>in a coordinated yet random
and completely mindless manner.</i>

54:53.624 --> 54:55.334
<i>There's been hours and hours</i>

54:55.501 --> 54:58.212
<i>of indiscriminate terror
on the streets of Mumbai</i>

54:58.379 --> 55:01.966
<i>and we still don't seem to be
at the end of it.</i>

55:02.133 --> 55:04.510
<i>Let's get you the big headlines
from Mumbai.</i>

55:04.677 --> 55:08.514
<i>At least 78 people are dead
and nearly 200 injured</i>

55:08.681 --> 55:10.558
<i>in a series of attacks
in South Mumbai.</i>

55:10.725 --> 55:14.061
<i>Three five-star hotels,
a petrol pump in Colaba,</i>

55:14.228 --> 55:16.439
<i>the CST Station,
the Cama Hospital,</i>

55:16.605 --> 55:19.066
<i>all come under attack.</i>

55:19.233 --> 55:22.278
<i>Mumbai's majestic Taj Hotel
is still burning</i>

55:22.445 --> 55:27.033
<i>as gun battles continue between
security forces and terrorists.</i>

55:27.199 --> 55:29.035
Would you like a drink?

55:30.536 --> 55:31.996
How much longer, Mr Savanth?

55:32.163 --> 55:34.081
You're the Chief of Police!
What's going on?

55:34.248 --> 55:36.167
<i>The head of our terror
squad was gunned down</i>

55:36.334 --> 55:38.127
<i>in his car tonight, Mr Oberoi,</i>

55:38.294 --> 55:40.338
<i>and special forces
are yet to leave Delhi.</i>

55:40.504 --> 55:43.341
Still in Delhi?
Then send somebody from here.

55:43.507 --> 55:45.259
Use the police force,
for God's sake.

55:45.426 --> 55:47.053
<i>We sent in a local squad
an hour ago</i>

55:47.219 --> 55:48.888
<i>but we haven't heard a word
since.</i>

56:01.567 --> 56:03.319
I'm sorry.

56:04.862 --> 56:06.655
I just want to be home.

56:17.792 --> 56:20.086
Who were you speaking with?

56:20.252 --> 56:21.921
What?

56:22.088 --> 56:23.547
Who were you talking to
on the phone?

56:23.714 --> 56:25.716
None of your business.

56:27.927 --> 56:29.720
She's one of them.

56:29.887 --> 56:32.515
- What are you trying to say?
- You're talking that language.

56:32.681 --> 56:34.868
- Are you calling me a terrorist?
- You were talking that language.

56:34.892 --> 56:36.560
- Just say it!
- Why won't you answer?

56:36.727 --> 56:38.437
Why won't you tell me
who was on the phone?

56:38.604 --> 56:40.314
- She's with me.
- I need you to tell me!

56:40.481 --> 56:42.483
- She's one of...
- Hey! Shut your mouth!

56:42.650 --> 56:45.027
Shut up! Walk away.

56:45.194 --> 56:47.988
- Your behaviour is disgraceful.
- Go fuck yourself. Walk away.

56:48.155 --> 56:50.658
Madam, come. Come.
It's okay, sir. Come.

56:50.825 --> 56:52.827
With everything going on,
that's what she tells me?

56:52.993 --> 56:54.370
- You're okay?
- No, seriously.

56:54.537 --> 56:56.247
Don't worry,
she is total bitch.

56:56.414 --> 56:58.332
- Come, come.
- Look at that face.

56:58.499 --> 57:01.627
She's not been fucked
for ten years. Minimum.

57:04.130 --> 57:05.631
- Hey.
- Thank you.

57:05.798 --> 57:07.842
Fine.

57:08.008 --> 57:10.928
It's a crazy situation
but we just have to wait.

57:11.095 --> 57:13.013
We'll be fine.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.652
Arjun. Arjun.

57:26.819 --> 57:27.945
Sorry.

57:29.780 --> 57:31.240
Yes, sir?

57:31.407 --> 57:33.527
See the English woman
over there, at the food station?

57:36.287 --> 57:37.580
Yes.

57:37.746 --> 57:39.415
She's worried about your beard.

57:40.583 --> 57:42.084
My beard?

57:42.251 --> 57:44.086
Also, your turban.

57:44.253 --> 57:46.464
Hang back in the kitchen
for a little bit, huh?

57:46.630 --> 57:48.257
Good boy.

58:01.228 --> 58:05.399
Madam, I'd... I'd like
to show you something.

58:07.026 --> 58:08.903
This is my family.

58:12.031 --> 58:14.533
This is my... this is my child.

58:16.202 --> 58:18.037
It's Seva.

58:18.204 --> 58:23.667
That's my... my wife and her
quite... quite awful sister.

58:28.881 --> 58:32.092
This is my... this is my pagri.

58:33.344 --> 58:35.471
To us Sikhs it is...

58:35.638 --> 58:37.264
It is sacred.

58:38.307 --> 58:43.103
It's a... It's a symbol
of... honour.

58:43.270 --> 58:44.939
And courage.

58:49.276 --> 58:51.070
Since I was a small boy,

58:51.237 --> 58:54.532
I've... never gone outside
without it.

58:57.034 --> 59:00.371
To do so would bring shame
to my family.

59:02.122 --> 59:07.294
But while we are in this hotel,
you are my guest

59:07.461 --> 59:09.380
and I am your staff,

59:09.547 --> 59:14.009
so if it would make you feel
comfortable, I will take it off.

59:14.176 --> 59:16.053
Would you like that?

59:16.220 --> 59:17.972
No.

59:18.138 --> 59:19.723
No.

59:19.890 --> 59:21.559
I'm just scared.

59:21.725 --> 59:23.727
We all are.

59:25.396 --> 59:27.773
But... to get through this

59:27.940 --> 59:32.570
we must... we must
stick together, okay?

59:34.613 --> 59:36.782
Yes. Indeed.

59:36.949 --> 59:38.909
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

59:39.076 --> 59:40.744
I will bring you some water,
okay?

59:40.911 --> 59:42.288
Okay.

59:47.084 --> 59:50.546
- Hello? Mrs Watson?
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>

59:50.713 --> 59:52.506
This is Lani
from the hotel reception.

59:52.673 --> 59:54.091
<i>Yes.</i>

59:54.258 --> 59:55.926
Ma'am, the rescue team is
on your floor.

59:56.093 --> 59:57.803
<i>- They are?</i>
- Yes.

59:57.970 --> 01:00:00.347
- They're on their way, ma'am.
<i>- Thank God.</i>

01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.725
<i>Yes, yes, I can hear them.</i>

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:04.685
<i>Alex, Alex, let them in.</i>

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:19.677
What are you doing? Don't open
that door. What, you crazy?

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.929
- You're going to get us killed!
- Be quiet!

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:27.142
Mr Oberoi, sir,
it's Prahba.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:29.395
- It could be a trap!
- I know what I'm doing, sir.

01:01:33.649 --> 01:01:35.234
Oh, my God, Prahba.

01:01:35.401 --> 01:01:37.820
It's not my blood. Come.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.530
Sh! Sh!

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:41.699
Arjun, attention!

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.617
It's okay, come, come,
please come.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:50.999
Please.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.168
Please, please.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:54.670
Be quiet!

01:01:54.837 --> 01:01:57.631
It's okay. Madam.
It's okay, it's okay.

01:01:57.798 --> 01:02:00.300
It's okay.

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:03.512
Is there a doctor here, please,
a doctor or a nurse?

01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:05.264
- I'm an ophthalmologist.
- Please come.

01:02:05.431 --> 01:02:07.471
I'm not sure if there's much
I can do but I can try.

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:10.728
I need to see the wound.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:13.689
Sh!

01:02:13.856 --> 01:02:16.150
Quiet! Be quiet!

01:02:19.695 --> 01:02:21.572
Okay, we need to tape
this hole shut

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:23.657
and we need to make
a sling for her arm.

01:02:23.824 --> 01:02:26.910
- Elastoplast, Sellotape...
- First-aid box!

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:29.830
Come, hold this, hold tight.

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:40.257
It's not good. I think she's
bleeding into her chest cavity.

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:42.760
There's no way to save her
without getting her to hospital.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:46.221
- I'll take her.
- Too risky.

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:49.266
If she stays, she'll die.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:56.690
Sir, please let me take her.

01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:59.651
We'll go down the back stairs,
straight out the service exit.

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:01.779
Arjun, if they find you,
they find us.

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:04.114
But if I make it,
we'll have a way out.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:07.409
Sh! Sh!

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:10.996
We can't just let her die here.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:15.000
Okay.

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:17.127
Call me when you get out.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.087
Deep breath.

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:21.089
Shhh. It's okay.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.550
Deep breath.

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:26.512
Madam, madam, madam.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:28.639
I'm going to get you
out of here, okay?

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:31.266
But... but there are some stairs.

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:33.393
Do you think you can stand?

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:37.064
- Yes.
- Yes? Okay, come on.

01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:38.732
Slowly. Come on.

01:03:38.899 --> 01:03:40.734
That's it.

01:03:42.528 --> 01:03:44.571
- Ma'am, you will be fine.
- Okay.

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:46.740
You'll be fine. Arjun is
with you. Don't worry.

01:04:50.596 --> 01:04:53.181
It's okay. It's okay.

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:56.602
It's okay, madam.
It's okay, it's okay.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.858
Sorry.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:28.759
Staff. Staff.

01:05:30.886 --> 01:05:34.097
Staff, staff. Hotel staff!
Please, please. Hotel staff.

01:05:56.995 --> 01:05:58.080
Go, go!

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:05.689
<i>Imran?</i>

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:14.239
Go, go, go.

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:19.494
David!

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.747
Open the door. Open the door!

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:27.020
Sh, sh, sh.

01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:03.700
Okay, sir.

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:05.952
Hey!

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:10.248
- Yeah, the front lobby here.
- Uh-huh.

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:12.083
Western entrance hall.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.585
Our Ocean Room.

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:35.190
There is still some of
the good stuff left.

01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:40.362
Single malt. 20 years old.

01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:01.883
What the hell was that?

01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:08.598
Hey. Stay here and stay down.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.310
<i>It's chaos out here, sir.
We're doing all we can.</i>

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:14.729
- Have you sent the men in?
<i>- I'm sorry, what men?</i>

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:16.940
- The rescue squad?
<i>- Yes, Mr Oberoi.</i>

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:20.068
<i>We sent in a squad hours ago,
but most were killed.</i>

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:35.792
Have you sent any Mohit Singh
as part of the squad?

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.384
Shit.

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.890
<i>Yes, Mr Oberoi, Mohit Singh
was part of the squad.</i>

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:53.017
<i>We lost contact hours ago.
We thought he was dead.</i>

01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:54.644
Okay, thank you.

01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:03.361
Arjun, I cannot...

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:05.155
Don't open the door, it's them!

01:12:22.714 --> 01:12:24.299
Sir? Sir?

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:31.681
Move! Out!

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.600
- Move!
- Down, down, down, down!

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.224
Okay.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:19.521
Thank you.

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:43.461
Sh, sh, sh,
quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:46.631
Down, down, down. Down, down.
Down, down.

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:06.711
No, no, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:09.214
It's okay. It's okay.

01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:16.679
REPORTER, TV:
<i>That was an explosion.</i>

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.932

Stop it! Stop it, Miss Kashani!

01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:35.706
Miss Kashani, please, stop it!

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:37.959
- Open it!
- Please come and sit here.

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:40.044
I have to be with my family.
Open the door.

01:20:40.211 --> 01:20:42.672
I know it's hard but
police are very near now.

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:44.590
No-one's coming.

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:48.678
We've been here six hours.
Six hours! For what?

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:50.596
No-one's coming for us.

01:20:51.848 --> 01:20:55.101
My baby's out there.
Please open the door.

01:20:55.268 --> 01:20:58.521
She's right.
Open the door.

01:20:58.688 --> 01:21:00.147
- I want to go.
- Me too.

01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:03.109
Please, we cannot evacuate
everyone without being detected.

01:21:03.276 --> 01:21:06.946
It's not everyone.
We are six people, that's all.

01:21:07.113 --> 01:21:08.865
We're going. Open the door.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:10.366
Sir...

01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:14.078
..if they hear us going,
we will all die.

01:21:14.245 --> 01:21:16.998
They know we are here.
If they come back, we all die.

01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:19.083
If they bomb the building,
we die.

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:21.961
If we leave, maybe we die.
We take our chances.

01:21:23.129 --> 01:21:25.798
Open the fucking door.
Now.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:38.895
Very well, sir.

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:51.407
- We'll be praying for you, sir.
- Yeah, fuck your prayers.

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:53.409
That's what started this shit.

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:12.219
Let's go.

01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:41.832
Zahra!

01:22:47.964 --> 01:22:49.256
Hey!

01:22:49.423 --> 01:22:50.800
This is stupid. Go. Let's go.

01:22:50.967 --> 01:22:52.677
I'm getting my baby.

01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:57.098
Run!

01:22:58.224 --> 01:22:59.433
Hey!

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:13.656
It's okay.

01:23:15.282 --> 01:23:18.285
They won't kill us.
They want us alive. It's okay.

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:17.720
Where's Cameron?

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:20.014
You don't know me.

01:24:41.285 --> 01:24:43.621
Indian? Huh?

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:48.501
Animals.

01:24:50.503 --> 01:24:51.796
No!

01:24:51.962 --> 01:24:54.340
No, no, no, no, no! No!

<i>These images,

01:25:19.073 --> 01:25:20.741
<i>confronted the two gunmen</i>

01:25:20.908 --> 01:25:22.409
<i>beating them with sticks.</i>

<i>The gunmen had earlier
hijacked a police van,</i>

<i>You will die for what you did

I fucked your mother!
I fucked your sister, you prick!

Please, don't worry.

Sorry, sir. There was
nowhere else to go.

01:34:40.801 --> 01:34:42.344
They set fire to the hotel.

01:34:42.511 --> 01:34:44.638
It's a baby.
What do you want me to do?

01:35:08.704 --> 01:35:11.540
Sally has Cameron.

01:35:11.707 --> 01:35:16.169

- They'll get us killed, Oberoi!
- Please listen, sir.

01:35:50.704 --> 01:35:53.039
The central part of the hotel
is burning.

01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:55.709
Security forces will not be here
in time.

01:35:55.876 --> 01:35:57.794
We must leave

01:35:57.961 --> 01:35:59.856
by the safety stairs
and out through the kitchens.

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:01.566
They'll find us,
they'll shoot us and kill us.

Sir...

01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:06.219
Sir, the hotel is burning.
This is our only choice.

If we are together,
we'll be fine.

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:19.691
Mobile phones off, please.

01:36:19.858 --> 01:36:21.985
Switch off your mobile phones

We're in the Chambers Lounge,
north wing.
