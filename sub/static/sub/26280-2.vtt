WEBVTT

00:02.828 --> 00:04.569
But I think, by the
end of the honeymoon,

00:04.613 --> 00:07.224
we really started to feel
like a married couple.

00:07.268 --> 00:09.226
But the good kind,
like on TV,

00:09.270 --> 00:11.489
not like my parents.Yeah.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.230
You're not a real married couple
until you can pee

00:13.274 --> 00:15.406
with the door open
and she's okay with it.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.236
I told you, I'm
not okay with it.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.630
She loves it.

00:21.673 --> 00:25.199
So, we got everybody gifts.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.635
Aw.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.116
Did you forget about us

00:29.159 --> 00:31.292
until you were at the airport?

00:31.335 --> 00:32.684
No.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.860
We forgot about you
until we were on the plane.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.123
Luckily,
there was Wi-Fi,

00:36.166 --> 00:37.994
and I have Amazon Prime.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.215
I heart New York.

00:41.258 --> 00:44.131
Aw, the baby's gonna love
throwing up on this.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.133
Look, it doesn't have
to just be New York.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.612
That's the beauty of it.

00:47.656 --> 00:50.659
Uh, the initials "N.Y."
can stand for anything you like.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.313
For instance, I
understand that there is

00:52.356 --> 00:54.576
an elderly rock-and-roll
musician named Neil Young.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.317
Perhaps you heart him.

00:56.360 --> 00:59.755
Or if not him, Egyptian
table tennis silver medalist

00:59.798 --> 01:01.844
Noha Yossry.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.150
Or Nana Yamaguchi,

01:03.193 --> 01:05.152
the Japanese voice actress

01:05.195 --> 01:07.719
who starred in
Sally the Witch.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.374
Did you just google
the initials "N.Y."?

01:10.418 --> 01:11.767
I had Wi-Fi and a
long plane flight.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.595
Draw your own
conclusions.

01:13.638 --> 01:17.860
Well, guys, that was very,
very thoughtful of you. I...

01:20.210 --> 01:22.952
Did you get me a double XL?

01:22.995 --> 01:25.259
I told you.You were right, dear.

01:26.477 --> 01:30.177

01:30.220 --> 01:33.310

01:55.811 --> 01:58.944
Sheldon, that's not how
you write a thank you card.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.424
What's wrong with it?

02:00.468 --> 02:02.644
"Dear Aunt Helen,

02:02.687 --> 02:04.994
"thank you so much for
the lovely place setting.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.822
"If my handwriting
looks strained,

02:06.865 --> 02:09.085
"that is because this is
the 16th thank you card

02:09.129 --> 02:11.914
"Amy has forced me to write.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.569
"The muscles in my
wrist are cramping

02:14.612 --> 02:18.007
"as I struggle to
finish this sentence.

02:18.050 --> 02:20.009
"Ow, ow, oh, the pain.

02:20.052 --> 02:22.229
Love, Sheldon."

02:22.272 --> 02:24.796
Fine.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.842
"And Amy."

02:27.843 --> 02:29.714
Ow.

02:29.758 --> 02:32.717
This one is from
Leonard and Penny.

02:32.761 --> 02:33.936
Aw.

02:33.979 --> 02:36.852
"The perfect gift for
the perfect couple."

02:36.895 --> 02:39.811
Save that card. We may need
to throw it back in their faces.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.074
I wonder what it could be.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.815
Oh, could be anything.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.904
A flute, a letter opener,

02:45.948 --> 02:47.210
one of those pens

02:47.254 --> 02:49.865
where you put the bikini
back on the naked lady.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.084
Oh.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.739
Isn't this nice?

02:57.438 --> 02:58.395
What is it?

02:58.439 --> 03:00.005
You know, it's, uh,

03:00.049 --> 03:02.051
it's one of those...

03:04.401 --> 03:07.361
Nope, doesn't do that.

03:07.404 --> 03:08.797
Oh, maybe it's candy.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.191
Lick it.

03:11.234 --> 03:13.367
I don't want to
lick it. You lick it.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.804
I'm not gonna lick it.
I just brushed my teeth.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.893
Is it from one of
your dumb sci-fi shows?

03:17.936 --> 03:20.939
Uh, none of the sci-fi shows
I watch are dumb.

03:20.983 --> 03:23.377
Sheldon...Okay, Westworld.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.030
But this has nothing
to do with that show,

03:25.074 --> 03:27.207
other than it's
also inexplicable.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.947
Well, Leonard and Penny
are our best friends.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.210
They know us
better than anyone.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.907
They said it's
the perfect gift.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.170
We must be
missing something.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.570
You don't...

03:42.613 --> 03:46.748
think it's a marital
aid, do you?

03:48.184 --> 03:49.664
Don't be silly.

03:49.707 --> 03:53.755
Amy, how is this big glass shaft
going to aid our marriage?

03:57.672 --> 03:59.064
Do you think
when Krypto the Superdog

03:59.108 --> 04:01.806
is out flying,
Superman has to fly after him

04:01.850 --> 04:03.721
with a little baggie?

04:03.765 --> 04:06.811
Hmm. Haven't really
thought about it before.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.291
But he doesn't
need a baggie,

04:08.335 --> 04:12.208
because he just blasts the
poop with his heat vision.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.731
You've thought about it before.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.385
Oh, I've thought
about it a lot.[chuckles]

04:15.429 --> 04:16.734
[chuckles]

04:21.348 --> 04:23.959
What is wrong
with Stuart's face?

04:24.002 --> 04:27.092
I think he's smiling.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.921
Oh, my God, are
they flirting?

04:29.965 --> 04:31.401
Oh, they're
way past flirting.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.404
I caught them making out
at Sheldon's wedding.

04:34.448 --> 04:38.930
Are you sure she wasn't trying
to breathe life back into him?

04:38.974 --> 04:40.149
I don't think so.

04:40.192 --> 04:41.455
When I used that much tongue
at CPR training,

04:41.498 --> 04:44.545
I had to buy the dummy.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.155
Ooh, I have class.

04:46.198 --> 04:47.156
I should go.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.331
Oh. Okay.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.202
Bye.Bye.

04:50.246 --> 04:51.421
[chuckles]

04:57.035 --> 04:58.776
[both chuckle]

04:58.820 --> 05:00.865
See ya, guys.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.867
Bye.Bye.

05:02.911 --> 05:06.088
So, what's her deal?

05:06.131 --> 05:09.221
Is she into you or does
she just hate her parents?

05:09.265 --> 05:10.266
I-I don't know.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.399
We kissed a little
at the wedding,

05:12.442 --> 05:13.791
and it was great.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.445
But we haven't really talked
about it since then.

05:15.489 --> 05:18.100
So I-I don't know
how she feels about me.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.754
Well, she patted you
on the head,

05:19.797 --> 05:23.018
so I'm guessing she feels
like you're such a good boy!

05:23.061 --> 05:25.107
[chuckles]

05:25.150 --> 05:27.414
Seriously, do you think
I should ask her out?

05:27.457 --> 05:29.024
A-Absolutely.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.504
Don't let love get away.

05:30.547 --> 05:33.550
It is the most important thing
in the world.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.247
Without it,
life is

05:35.291 --> 05:37.641
dark and meaningless
and all you're left with

05:37.685 --> 05:39.251
is the judgmental gaze
of your dog

05:39.295 --> 05:43.255
as you finish off a bag
of Doritos on the toilet.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.692
Thanks.

05:44.735 --> 05:47.085
You're a real good pal.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.350
And now you're
a good boy!

05:51.873 --> 05:53.875
[smooches]

05:58.227 --> 05:59.402
I can't stop thinking
about that present.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.882
It's driving me crazy.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.231
Me, too!

06:02.274 --> 06:04.233
The card said it was
the perfect gift.

06:04.276 --> 06:07.062
But it's not a dinosaur fossil
or matching pocket watches,

06:07.105 --> 06:09.673
so I don't see
how it can be.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.109
Maybe we're trying too hard.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.546
Maybe it's something simple.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.764
[gasps] Like
Leonard and Penny.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.418
Yes, good.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.638
We just need to
think like them.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.249
[inhales, exhales]
Okay.

06:20.292 --> 06:23.252
What gift can I get us

06:23.295 --> 06:28.475
to express how grateful we are
to have us in their lives?

06:28.518 --> 06:30.781
Way to make it simple.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.174
I'm just gonna ask them.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.568
No, you can't;
it'll hurt their feelings.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.134
I'm okay with that.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.614
And they'll know
you weren't smart enough

06:37.658 --> 06:39.050
to figure it out
on your own.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.531
You're right.
Oh, this is awful.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.620
And I can't even comfort
myself by stroking

06:43.664 --> 06:47.276
the fossilized tibia
of a Pentaceratops.

06:47.319 --> 06:48.756
Let's just go to sleep.

06:48.799 --> 06:50.758
We'll look at it in the morning
with fresh eyes,

06:50.801 --> 06:52.194
and maybe it'll come to us.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.282
Fine.

06:59.157 --> 07:02.465
Or we go tear apart that box
and look for a clue.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.946
Staying up past my bedtime
and solving mysteries?

07:04.989 --> 07:06.817
Who knew married life
could be this good?

07:13.607 --> 07:16.044
What's wrong
with his face?

07:16.087 --> 07:17.872
A lot of people have
been asking that.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.439
He's... smiling.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.268
Hey, Stuart,
you look pretty happy.

07:23.312 --> 07:24.574
Oh, yeah.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.011
I, uh, asked Denise out
on a date,

07:27.055 --> 07:29.144
and she said yes.Aw.

07:29.187 --> 07:30.493
That's great.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.408
But don't smile like that
in front of Halley.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.845
She just started sleeping
through the night.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.456
Sorry. I'm excited.

07:36.499 --> 07:39.720
I haven't been on a date
in a long time.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.243
Back when I was dating,
I'd always wear

07:41.286 --> 07:43.332
a new pair of underwear,
just in case.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.509
It's also been a long time
since I bought new underwear.

07:46.553 --> 07:47.945
And I probably should,

07:47.989 --> 07:52.210
because these are no longer
tighty nor whitey.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.473
Okay, I'm out.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.085
If there's a chance
someone's gonna see you naked,

07:57.128 --> 08:00.697
it's also polite to make sure
you're well-groomed down there.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.483
I get it, Howard.
I've been busy!

08:06.660 --> 08:08.226
Hello.

08:08.270 --> 08:09.576
Hey.I just wanted

08:09.619 --> 08:12.535
to pop over and hand-deliver
this thank you note

08:12.579 --> 08:15.320
for your very thoughtful
wedding gift.PENNY: Oh.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.887
Oh, good. You
guys liked it?

08:16.931 --> 08:19.237
Well, we liked it a lot more
than things that aren't it,

08:19.281 --> 08:20.978
I'll tell you that.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.414
Well, yeah, that's great.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.199
Because when we saw it,
we thought, "Amy and Sheldon

08:24.242 --> 08:25.635
just have to have that."

08:25.679 --> 08:27.419
Oh, do tell.
Now, paint a picture for me,

08:27.463 --> 08:29.247
like where you were
when you found it

08:29.291 --> 08:32.250
and what you thought
we'd enjoy doing with it.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.645
Do you not know what it is?

08:35.689 --> 08:36.907
PENNY:
Of course he knows

08:36.951 --> 08:40.128
what it is. He's
the smartest man in the world.

08:40.171 --> 08:42.609
Well, I don't know
about the world.

08:42.652 --> 08:45.568
Some of those Chinese fellas
are pretty clever.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.570
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going

08:47.614 --> 08:49.616
to return home and use your gift

08:49.659 --> 08:52.488
in the manner
which it was intended.

08:54.795 --> 08:55.839
[laughing]

08:55.883 --> 08:57.449
He-He's never gonna
figure it out.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.451
I know.[thumping]

08:59.495 --> 09:01.671
SHELDON:
What are you?!

09:02.629 --> 09:04.718
Gosh, this makes me happy.Yeah.

09:04.761 --> 09:05.893
[laughs]

09:07.372 --> 09:10.332
Howard, I don't
often say this,

09:10.375 --> 09:12.073
but, good, you're here. Now,

09:12.116 --> 09:13.857
do you know

09:13.901 --> 09:16.381
what Leonard and Penny got
us for our wedding gift?

09:16.425 --> 09:17.557
Well...[stammers]
Don't answer.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.688
I don't want to know.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.342
I just want to
know if you know.

09:20.385 --> 09:21.648
I do know.Okay, great.

09:21.691 --> 09:24.259
I believe that Amy and
I have figured it out.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.653
Is it a clue to
a scavenger hunt

09:26.696 --> 09:29.090
that will lead us
to the actual present?

09:29.133 --> 09:30.657
If you're asking

09:30.700 --> 09:33.007
if you and Amy should spend
the next couple days

09:33.050 --> 09:35.662
running all over town searching
for the next clue,

09:35.705 --> 09:38.708
I'm gonna have to say yes.

09:38.752 --> 09:39.709
I knew it!

09:39.753 --> 09:41.102
This is so much fun.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.583
Oh, it really is.
[chuckles]

09:43.626 --> 09:45.149
Oh, Leonard,
thank you again.

09:45.193 --> 09:48.196
We love the gift.Aw.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.501
Does he know what it is?

09:49.545 --> 09:50.764
No, not even close.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.592
He thinks it's a clue
to a scavenger hunt.

09:52.635 --> 09:53.636
[laughs]

09:53.680 --> 09:56.117
So, so happy.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.858
Well, what is it?
What did you give them?

09:57.901 --> 10:00.469
Oh, i-it's just this
dumb crystal wand

10:00.512 --> 10:02.906
that Howard and Bernadette
gave us for our wedding.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.647
Penny and I
made each other miserable

10:04.691 --> 10:06.649
trying to figure out
what it was, and we thought,

10:06.693 --> 10:10.610
"Why not pass that fun along
to Sheldon and Amy."

10:10.653 --> 10:11.915
Wait a minute. Did--

10:11.959 --> 10:14.352
did you give them the
crystal chakra wand

10:14.396 --> 10:16.616
that I gave you
for yourwedding?

10:18.313 --> 10:20.924
Yeah, that's exactly
what we did.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.623
You said you liked it!

10:23.666 --> 10:25.799
Yeah, that's exactly
what I said.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.679
Wow. A scavenger hunt.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.725
That's exciting.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.336
I had a bit of a scavenger hunt
myself last night.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.424
I was trying
to find the remote.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.905
I looked under
one of the cushions.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.254
Wasn't there.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.517
Then I lifted the cushion
a little higher.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.562
Bingo.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.564
Riveting.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.306
So, do you know what it is?

10:55.350 --> 10:57.134
Of course I know what it is.

10:57.178 --> 11:00.485
It's a silicon dioxide crystal,
otherwise known as quartz.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.531
Are you sure?

11:02.574 --> 11:06.448
Am I sure? Is basalt a mafic
extrusive igneous rock formed

11:06.491 --> 11:09.712
by the rapid cooling
of magnesium and iron-rich lava?

11:09.756 --> 11:11.671
Yeah, I'm sure.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.934
Okay, so it's quartz.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.413
That's got
to mean something.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.111
What do we know
about quartz?

11:17.154 --> 11:18.373
I'll google it.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.418
Or you can ask me, the geologist

11:20.462 --> 11:22.246
who won the MacArthur
Genius Grant.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.727
Got it!

11:24.771 --> 11:26.990
Quartz, from the
German "quarz"

11:27.034 --> 11:30.211
which sounds the same, but
is spelled without a "T".

11:30.254 --> 11:33.736
Interesting. No "T".

11:33.780 --> 11:36.304
What is not "T"?

11:36.347 --> 11:37.871
Coffee!

11:37.914 --> 11:40.482
The coffee shop
where we first met!

11:40.525 --> 11:43.137
All right, let's go.
Sorry.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.923
I think I just had an adrenaline
rush from having visitors.

11:50.318 --> 11:53.887
Hey, Raj, will you, um,
smell something for me?

11:53.930 --> 11:55.758
Uh, that depends.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.413
Actually, it doesn't depend.
Just no.

11:58.456 --> 12:02.373
I'm trying out some new colognes
for my date with Denise.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.810
Oh, and you just came over here

12:03.853 --> 12:06.377
to rub it in my face
that you have a date?No.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.249
I came over here
because I need advice,

12:08.292 --> 12:11.165
and you've gone out with
more women than anybody I know.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.080
Huh. I guess you're right.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.647
Sheldon's the smart one,
Howard's the funny one,

12:15.691 --> 12:18.476
and apparently,
I'm the ladies' man.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.391
Which one's Leonard?

12:20.435 --> 12:21.566
Oh, yeah, right.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.351
I guess Leonard's
the forgettable one.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.179
Okay, let's have a whiff.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.007
Oh.

12:27.050 --> 12:30.532
[sniffs]
Hmm. Smells like Paco Rabanne.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.795
Ooh, you're good.
I bought it at a swap meet.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.537
It's actually called
"Smells Like Paco Rabanne."

12:35.580 --> 12:37.539
It's great.
She's gonna love it.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.062
I hope so.

12:39.106 --> 12:42.109
I really like Denise, and I
don't want to screw this up.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.632
Hey, relax.

12:43.675 --> 12:46.243
Trust your instincts.
That's what I do.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.333
And that works for you?

12:51.379 --> 12:54.338
Actually... no.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.820
I've made a mess of my life,
and I'm...

12:57.864 --> 13:00.127
I'm all alone.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.481
Okay, I think
it'd be best for both of us

13:06.524 --> 13:09.789
if I pretend to get
a phone call and just walk away.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.227
Yeah, that would be best.

13:13.270 --> 13:15.925
Hello. This is Stuart.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.014
[whispering]:
Sorry. I got to take this.

13:19.668 --> 13:22.149
Uh, why, yes, I'd
love to take a survey.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.112
Okay, this is where
we first met.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.635
There's got to be a clue
here somewhere.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.246
[gasps] We sat at that table.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.119
Excuse me.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.904
I'm sorry.
We're on a scavenger hunt.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.209
Just pretend
we're not here.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.210
Oh, I found something!

13:40.254 --> 13:41.255
[shrieks]
It's gum.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.651
Maybe they left it
behind the counter.

13:46.695 --> 13:50.873
I met my wife here,
and we sat at this very table,

13:50.917 --> 13:53.006
so if you play your cards right,
in eight years,

13:53.049 --> 13:54.398
you could marry this woman.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.226
That's my sister.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.317
Well, don't tell people.
That's not okay.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.931
Sheldon, look,
I asked the barista

14:04.974 --> 14:06.497
if anyone
left anything for us,

14:06.541 --> 14:08.630
and she said to look
in this lost and found box.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.850
But why would it be in
the lost and found box?

14:10.893 --> 14:15.550
Because we were lost,
and then we found each other.

14:15.593 --> 14:18.118
It makes perfect sense.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.555
Oh. And look at this.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.078
A locket.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.559
And that stone in front--
I bet it's quartz.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.561
This must be it. This
must be the actual gift.

14:26.604 --> 14:27.475
Open it up.
What's inside?

14:27.518 --> 14:30.347
Nothing. It's empty.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.349
Of course.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.177
Our life together
is just starting,

14:34.221 --> 14:36.701
and they want us to fill
it with our memories.

14:36.745 --> 14:41.881
This might be
the best wedding gift ever.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.970
[gasps] They also left us
a pair of sunglasses

14:44.013 --> 14:46.146
because our
future's so bright!

14:48.583 --> 14:50.541
They thought of everything!

14:54.371 --> 14:55.764
Oh.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.157
Look what Halley drew.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.854
Yeah, she made it at daycare.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.203
It's pretty good, huh?

15:00.247 --> 15:02.858
Is it?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.905
Wow. Gentile moms are tough.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.603
[knocking on door]

15:08.646 --> 15:11.519
STUART: Guys, I need
to show you something,

15:11.562 --> 15:14.478
but you have to promise
not to make fun of me.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.524
Of course.

15:21.703 --> 15:24.184
Whoa.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.708
Yeah. I was worried
about the date

15:26.751 --> 15:30.581
so I got my hair colored to make
me feel a little more confident,

15:30.625 --> 15:34.237
but that just made me look
paler, so I-I got a spray tan.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.760
Have you tried
showering,

15:35.804 --> 15:37.588
seeing if you
could scrub it off?

15:37.632 --> 15:39.634
I did.

15:39.677 --> 15:42.245
You're gonna need
some new towels.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.813
And a bathmat.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.511
And a toilet seat.

15:53.561 --> 15:56.085
I'm picking her up in an hour.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.567
What am I gonna do?!

15:59.610 --> 16:01.221
Don't you mean
what are you gonna

16:01.264 --> 16:02.918
"Oompa Loompa doompety do"?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.966
You said you weren't
gonna make any jokes.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.664
I'm sorry. I'll stop.
[mouthing]

16:09.707 --> 16:11.013
[giggles]

16:11.057 --> 16:12.710
Look, it's only
a spray tan.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.756
It'll fade in a couple days.

16:14.799 --> 16:16.584
Why don't you cancel
the date and reschedule?

16:16.627 --> 16:19.587
Oh, but I was really
looking forward to tonight.

16:19.630 --> 16:22.024
You know what? Then go.
Tell her what happened.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.200
Maybe she'll be flattered.WOLOWITZ:
And if not,

16:24.244 --> 16:27.899
swing by the chocolate factory
and see if they're hiring.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.859
That wasn't a joke. That was
a legitimate suggestion.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.950
[Skype ringing]

16:35.951 --> 16:37.605
DR. KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hello?

16:37.648 --> 16:39.172
Hey, Dad.

16:39.215 --> 16:42.827
Rajesh. What a nice surprise,
calling me on my birthday.

16:42.871 --> 16:47.615
Yes. That's why I'm calling.

16:47.658 --> 16:50.139
And-and what better gift
to give you than the gift

16:50.183 --> 16:53.273
of marrying an Indian woman,
just like you've always wanted.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.014
My goodness, Rajesh,
this is exciting news.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.450
Who is she?

16:56.493 --> 16:58.365
You tell me.

16:58.408 --> 16:59.627
What?

16:59.670 --> 17:03.370
I want you
to arrange a marriage for me.

17:03.413 --> 17:06.112
I'm just so tired
of being single,

17:06.155 --> 17:09.854
and I'm finally just...
I'm-I'm ready to settle down.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.596
I can't just call up
some girl's dad

17:12.640 --> 17:14.337
and make her marry you.

17:14.381 --> 17:18.080
It's-it's not 2015 anymore.

17:18.124 --> 17:21.257
I know that, but I can't do this
on my own. I need your help.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.693
[sighs]

17:22.737 --> 17:24.521
Well, then, I'm going
to need your help, too.

17:24.565 --> 17:27.742
If I'm going to find a woman
to set you up with,

17:27.785 --> 17:30.527
you're going to need
to stop Instagramming pictures

17:30.571 --> 17:33.617
of you and your dog
wearing matching sweaters.

17:33.661 --> 17:37.012
Fine, if that's what it takes
to show you that I'm serious.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.796
Uh, quick question.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.537
Do you mean justInstagram,
or all my social...?

17:40.581 --> 17:42.365
All of them!

17:42.409 --> 17:44.715
Okay, deal.

17:44.759 --> 17:47.718
All right.
Let me ask you a question.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.981
What do you think of this woman?

17:50.025 --> 17:52.419
Oh. Oh, my God, she's beautiful.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.899
Is that who you're going
to set me up with?

17:54.943 --> 17:57.989
No! That's who I'mdating.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.691
But maybe
she has an older sister.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.000
So we put a little picture of me

18:09.044 --> 18:11.394
and a little picture
of Sheldon in it.

18:15.877 --> 18:19.141
In-in the locket?

18:19.185 --> 18:20.882
Yes.

18:20.925 --> 18:24.103
That was in
a lost and found box?

18:24.146 --> 18:26.931
Exactly.

18:26.975 --> 18:29.673
Where we hid it?

18:29.717 --> 18:31.936
So really, you gave us
three amazing gifts.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.503
You gave the locket,
the adventure

18:33.547 --> 18:36.550
and the realization
that Amy and I can do anything

18:36.593 --> 18:38.769
as long as we
work together.

18:38.813 --> 18:41.946
We wrote you a special
thank you note.Oh.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.299
Are those words?

18:48.823 --> 18:50.651
No.

18:50.694 --> 18:54.568
It's a secret code that you two
get to figure out together.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.181
Hint: it's based
on Sanskrit,

18:59.225 --> 19:01.618
but not the Sanskrit
you're thinking of.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.011
[laughs]

19:03.054 --> 19:07.233
And best of all, you can't use
the Internet to cheat.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.365
Because we locked you
out of your Wi-Fi,

19:09.409 --> 19:12.803
and the answer to this
is your new password.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.027
I'm no longer happy.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.813
Hey, guys. Great news.

19:22.857 --> 19:25.251
I'm getting married.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.949
Huh?
What?
No.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.082
Well, I-I haven't met her yet,

19:31.126 --> 19:33.084
but her name is Anu.

19:33.128 --> 19:33.911
My father says she comes
from a good family.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.304
She's in her 30s.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.088
She works
in hospitality management.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.656
So, as long as I can get
through six to ten dates

19:39.700 --> 19:42.485
without revealing
my true self...

19:43.878 --> 19:46.054
...this is happening.

19:46.097 --> 19:49.449
I know just what we're giving
them for a wedding gift.

19:57.718 --> 19:58.806
Oh.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.026
Oh, my God.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.246
Yeah.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.161
I wanted to look my best
for our date,

20:06.205 --> 20:11.427
and I made a series
of bad decisions...

20:13.081 --> 20:17.477
...one of which is hidden
by my pants.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.088
Wow. [laughs]

20:20.131 --> 20:23.526
Do you still want
to go out with me?

20:23.570 --> 20:27.965
Absolutely. Hey, maybe we
can go find Nemo together.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.185
That's a good one.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.231
[clears throat]

20:32.274 --> 20:34.711
Do your 63 other crayon
friends know you're out?

20:34.755 --> 20:36.931
Are you just gonna
make fun of me all night?

20:36.974 --> 20:38.454
Probably.
Great.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.195
So what are we thinking,
Chinese?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.241
Yeah, I'm in the mood
for orange chicken.
