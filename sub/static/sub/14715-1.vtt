00:23.990 --> 00:26.091
So where you folks flying in from?

00:26.192 --> 00:28.060
Phoenix.

00:28.161 --> 00:30.796
You preaching on Sunday?

00:30.897 --> 00:32.998
I mean, you are Grace Greenleaf,
ain't you?

00:36.536 --> 00:37.844
I am.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.372
I don't preach anymore.

00:40.473 --> 00:43.042
You don't? Oh. How come?

00:45.178 --> 00:46.712
Can we get out here, please?

00:46.813 --> 00:48.572
Well, the house
is just up the road here...

00:48.597 --> 00:49.952
- I know, but could we...
- Why are we stopping...

00:49.977 --> 00:52.151
- Right here is great.
- Okay.

01:03.329 --> 01:04.897
Hope I didn't say the wrong thing.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.498
Not at all.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.867
I just wanted a chance to
stretch my legs, you know?

01:08.968 --> 01:10.469
How far is it to the house?

01:10.570 --> 01:12.171
Not far. Just wait a second.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.640
My mama used to love your preaching.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.675
I hope I can say that.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.777
- You've seen her preach?
- Oh, yeah.

01:18.878 --> 01:21.747
My mama used to go to Calvary
every Sunday when she was alive.

01:21.848 --> 01:24.149
She used to drag me there
when your mama was preaching.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.118
She'd say, "How come you can't find

01:26.219 --> 01:27.886
a righteous girl like that, Eugene?

01:27.987 --> 01:29.955
Why you always running around
with these trashy hos?"

01:30.056 --> 01:31.590
I'm sorry. That's how my mother was.

01:31.691 --> 01:32.825
Oh, no, no, no. It's all right.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.093
She's heard it all.

01:34.194 --> 01:35.727
Here you go.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.129
Tip's already included
in the fare, ma'am.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.507
That's the genius of the app.

01:38.767 --> 01:40.900
Did your mama give money
to Calvary when she was alive?

01:41.709 --> 01:43.694
Well, I suppose she did, yeah.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.406
This isn't a tip. This is a refund.

01:49.533 --> 01:51.143
Partial refund, anyway.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.911
All right. God bless you.

01:53.012 --> 01:55.247
You, too. Thanks.

01:57.016 --> 01:58.484
Baby, come on.

02:08.828 --> 02:09.995
Are you okay?

02:10.734 --> 02:12.164
Yeah.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.432
I just wanted to stop.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.546
Is that the lake where Aunt Faith...

02:36.623 --> 02:37.956
Better get going.

02:48.268 --> 02:49.401
Wow.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.669
Yeah.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.237
Didn't look like this when I lived here.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.339
They've made some improvements.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.574
Can I help you folks?

02:55.675 --> 02:56.842
Hi. I'm Grace Greenleaf.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.210
I'm sorry, Miss Greenleaf.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.078
I heard you guys would be in a town car.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.948
Yeah, I just... wanted to walk.

03:12.492 --> 03:13.692
Hey, Noah.

03:14.259 --> 03:15.593
I'm so sorry.

03:16.896 --> 03:18.363
Yeah, me, too.

03:18.464 --> 03:19.898
Thank you.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.968
Sophia, this is Mr. Kendall.

03:26.995 --> 03:29.241
- Head of security.
- Nice to meet you.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.475
I'll drive you out to the house.

03:31.109 --> 03:32.044
I'll take those for you.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.812
That'd be great. Thank you.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.586
So how far is it to the house?

03:40.687 --> 03:43.088
It's about a mile or so.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.490
Wow.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.607
♪ Amen

04:05.245 --> 04:06.511
♪ Amen

04:15.088 --> 04:16.521
♪ Well

04:28.868 --> 04:32.838
♪ Amen, amen, ooh.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

04:50.501 --> 04:51.980
So, are you still
reporting for the news?

04:52.081 --> 04:53.018
Yeah.

04:54.233 --> 04:55.594
We might be moving to New York.

04:55.695 --> 04:57.763
- Sophia.
- For what?

04:57.864 --> 04:59.921
She's going to be on "20/20."

05:00.967 --> 05:02.467
- Seriously?
- No.

05:02.568 --> 05:04.469
That's big time.

05:04.570 --> 05:05.837
I just interviewed twice.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.472
They haven't even
offered me the job yet.

05:07.573 --> 05:10.042
That's cool to be considered, anyway.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.810
And you'll probably get it.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.048
We'll see.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.542
Does the whole
family live in this house?

05:36.643 --> 05:38.870
- Yeah.
- Wow.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.267
The prodigal daughter returns.

05:50.368 --> 05:51.275
Daddy.

05:55.154 --> 05:57.889
No, no. Stay right here, child.

05:58.308 --> 05:59.854
I want to hold on to you.

06:00.481 --> 06:01.819
I... I need to.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.905
You know what Isaiah said.

06:09.006 --> 06:11.203
Isaiah said a lot of things, Daddy.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.972
"Remember not the former things,

06:14.073 --> 06:16.552
nor consider the things of old."

06:17.210 --> 06:18.744
This here's a time for healing.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.712
- Hmm?
- I know.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.000
You going to greet your Uncle Mac?

06:27.841 --> 06:28.787
Hi.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.556
Oh, let me take a look at
my beautiful granddaughter.

06:31.657 --> 06:34.226
I've waited so long to meet you.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.531
Promise me...

06:39.632 --> 06:41.042
you're not here to sow discord

06:41.067 --> 06:43.003
in the fields of my peace.

06:44.203 --> 06:45.504
Nice to see you, too, Mama.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.035
I mean, I just don't want trouble.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.229
I don't think I could take it.

06:51.644 --> 06:52.811
I'm only here for two days.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.079
I just want to pay my respects.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.380
Good.

06:55.481 --> 06:58.350
- Come on.
- Sophia!

06:58.451 --> 07:00.485
So tell me, how was your flight?

07:02.955 --> 07:06.311
Lord, we stand humbly
before you on this day

07:07.460 --> 07:09.728
facing a great mystery.

07:09.829 --> 07:12.800
As your servant Job said long before us,

07:13.271 --> 07:15.303
"Where shall wisdom be found?

07:16.002 --> 07:18.437
Where is the place of understanding?"

07:19.598 --> 07:21.631
We mortals do not know it.

07:22.041 --> 07:26.044
It is not found
in the land of the living.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.031
You've taken our daughter...

07:30.049 --> 07:31.326
our sister...

07:32.051 --> 07:33.318
our friend.

07:33.945 --> 07:36.553
Please hold her close, Lord,

07:37.490 --> 07:39.291
and let her know that she is loved.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.561
Let us pray.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.731
The Lord is my shepherd.

07:47.470 --> 07:49.534
I shall not want.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.168
Hey, babe.

08:00.269 --> 08:01.903
What you getting all made up for?

08:02.005 --> 08:03.639
It's just family.

08:03.740 --> 08:05.827
It's not just family.

08:05.928 --> 08:07.522
Gigi's home.

08:11.561 --> 08:13.528
So, why didn't it work out
with you and Noah?

08:13.629 --> 08:16.498
He seems nice.

08:16.599 --> 08:17.550
That obvious, huh?

08:17.651 --> 08:19.034
Kind of, yeah.

08:19.135 --> 08:20.768
Ugh, I have to work on my poker face.

08:21.904 --> 08:23.439
All right, get washed
up for dinner, honey.

08:24.225 --> 08:25.440
You didn't answer my question.

08:25.541 --> 08:27.535
I know. Hey.

08:28.203 --> 08:29.142
Who is it?

08:29.167 --> 08:31.279
It's your Great-Aunt Mavis, baby.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.157
Y'all get in okay?

08:33.258 --> 08:34.567
Yeah, just unpacking.

08:35.351 --> 08:36.485
How was the funeral?

08:36.586 --> 08:37.818
It was fine.

08:39.789 --> 08:41.256
No one said "suicide."

08:41.357 --> 08:42.691
No one said it was all our fault.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.460
It was just God's mysterious ways.

08:45.561 --> 08:46.513
You know how Daddy is.

08:46.614 --> 08:49.865
Huh. Well, you know, you cannot
expect people to feel bad about

08:49.966 --> 08:51.233
what they didn't have the heart

08:51.334 --> 08:52.501
to think happened in the first place.

08:52.602 --> 08:54.669
Think you can escape later?

08:54.770 --> 08:57.072
- If dinner doesn't go late.
- Won't be too late for me.

08:57.173 --> 08:59.508
I don't even stop serving
till 2:00 in the morning.

08:59.609 --> 09:01.276
Then I guess I'll see you.

09:01.377 --> 09:03.478
Good, and when you drive in, baby,

09:03.579 --> 09:06.314
take 240, 'cause Barton's
all closed down.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.049
- Why?
- Demonstration.

09:08.150 --> 09:10.235
Some cop shot another child.

09:11.013 --> 09:11.915
Anyway...

09:12.542 --> 09:15.644
steal one of your daddy's
cars and come see me.

09:17.413 --> 09:18.547
I will.

09:20.917 --> 09:23.552
Yes. Hey.

09:23.653 --> 09:25.220
Thanks, Annika.

09:30.526 --> 09:31.793
Jacob.

09:32.377 --> 09:34.143
Zora's ready. Let's go.

09:34.830 --> 09:36.575
All right, one second.
I'll be right there.

09:37.236 --> 09:39.238
Don't you look nice?

09:39.339 --> 09:40.002
Come here.

09:40.103 --> 09:42.038
What's he do in there?

09:42.139 --> 09:43.772
Who knows?

09:46.109 --> 09:48.210
All right. Who's hungry?

09:53.216 --> 09:56.618
Senator Bob Banks
is coming by your office

09:56.719 --> 09:58.253
tomorrow morning before service.

09:58.354 --> 10:02.557
Why? Is he asking for money
for his campaign?

10:02.659 --> 10:05.560
Doesn't he know what we're
going through right now?

10:05.662 --> 10:07.108
I tried to reschedule, but...

10:07.209 --> 10:10.185
I'm happy to have something to
move on to, in all honesty.

10:10.933 --> 10:13.969
Well, maybe he's breaking up
with that crazy wife of his.

10:14.070 --> 10:17.539
You remember the last time we were
in Washington at their house?

10:17.640 --> 10:20.075
She was dressed like something
out of "Star Wars."

10:23.112 --> 10:24.379
Who's Bob Banks?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.481
He's the senior senator from Tennessee.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.089
He's coming to church
tomorrow morning to visit.

10:29.418 --> 10:32.792
I think he's coming to ask
me about David Nelson,

10:32.817 --> 10:34.043
that trigger-happy cop.

10:34.263 --> 10:35.203
He's a member at Calvary?

10:35.496 --> 10:36.258
No, he's on the roll.

10:36.359 --> 10:37.659
So he's black?

10:37.760 --> 10:38.994
On the outside.

10:39.095 --> 10:41.063
Oh, Mac.

10:41.164 --> 10:43.598
But, see, I think that Bob believes

10:43.700 --> 10:45.434
this fella has confessed to me,

10:46.255 --> 10:48.403
given me some kind of privileged account

10:48.504 --> 10:49.771
about what really happened that night.

10:49.872 --> 10:51.606
But I've never even met the man.

10:52.304 --> 10:53.407
You said he's a member.

10:53.509 --> 10:56.411
Well, he is, but we have 4,000
people every Sunday, Gigi.

10:56.954 --> 10:59.114
I don't know half the people there.

10:59.215 --> 11:01.283
Now, can we talk about something else?

11:01.384 --> 11:03.385
I mean, I'm tired of borrowing trouble.

11:03.486 --> 11:05.587
Yes, Bishop. Yeah.

11:05.688 --> 11:07.589
What church do you go to in Phoenix?

11:07.690 --> 11:09.091
We're at Fountain of Life.

11:09.728 --> 11:11.493
Aw, they must be so blessed to have you,

11:11.594 --> 11:12.861
with all your experience.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.863
Yeah, well, I don't think they even know

11:14.964 --> 11:16.365
that I'm there, honestly.

11:16.466 --> 11:19.174
We pretty much just go
Christmas and Easter.

11:19.836 --> 11:22.137
- Really?
- Work keeps me pretty busy.

11:22.561 --> 11:25.507
- Hmm.
- Oh, well, that's interesting.

11:25.608 --> 11:26.808
Are you still Christian?

11:26.909 --> 11:28.297
What?

11:29.212 --> 11:31.546
Come on. What is this, an inquisition?

11:31.647 --> 11:33.515
No, it's a conversation.

11:33.616 --> 11:35.317
It's something people have
when they're in the same room

11:35.418 --> 11:37.519
and their phones are off.

11:39.756 --> 11:40.889
Sorry.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.891
Mother, may we be excused?

11:42.992 --> 11:45.460
Of course. Flee, flee!

11:45.561 --> 11:47.662
I would, too, if I wasn't anchored here

11:47.764 --> 11:49.865
by the demands of propriety.

11:52.168 --> 11:54.269
Oh!

11:54.370 --> 11:55.971
Come on, darling.

11:56.072 --> 11:57.606
Hey, Zora, sweetheart,
where you guys going?

11:57.707 --> 11:59.541
Just around.

11:59.642 --> 12:00.876
Okay, stay together.

12:00.977 --> 12:02.162
We will.

12:03.146 --> 12:06.181
So, are you one of these people
nowadays I hear so much about

12:06.282 --> 12:09.367
who are more spiritual than religious?

12:10.653 --> 12:12.854
- Um...
- Mmm, whatever that means.

12:12.955 --> 12:14.156
No, I'd say I'm a Christian.

12:14.257 --> 12:15.729
Who believes what, though?

12:16.800 --> 12:18.326
I'm only asking because you say

12:18.428 --> 12:19.628
you don't go to church regularly.

12:22.432 --> 12:24.699
Well, I think there's lots
of ways to commune with God,

12:24.801 --> 12:27.869
and not all of them take place in
a church or a house of worship.

12:28.584 --> 12:29.704
But the Bible commands Christians

12:29.806 --> 12:31.339
to go to church regularly.

12:32.235 --> 12:34.248
Or don't you believe
in the Bible anymore?

12:34.941 --> 12:36.611
Or do you just cherry-pick
what you like from it?

12:36.712 --> 12:38.513
I know that's the fashion now, too.

12:38.614 --> 12:39.732
Kerissa.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.150
Oh.

12:42.251 --> 12:43.785
I hope it's okay to talk about this.

12:43.886 --> 12:45.096
I'm just curious.

12:45.197 --> 12:48.223
Grace, she used to be
this legendary preacher.

12:48.324 --> 12:51.011
- She was.
- Thank you, Daddy.

12:51.112 --> 12:52.544
I wish I had heard her preach.

12:53.118 --> 12:54.073
Now here she's sitting

12:54.098 --> 12:57.302
saying she doesn't even
go to church anymore?

12:58.422 --> 13:00.256
I mean, I'm just curious.

13:01.003 --> 13:02.370
Kerissa...

13:02.472 --> 13:05.762
I think it best if we
go on to something else.

13:05.863 --> 13:07.709
- Yes.
- Please.

13:08.095 --> 13:09.177
No.

13:12.489 --> 13:13.484
Go on.

13:14.322 --> 13:15.422
I'm interested, too.

13:16.853 --> 13:19.597
What do you believe, Grace?

13:21.257 --> 13:22.858
Well, Mama, I believe that the Bible

13:22.959 --> 13:25.508
is one useful tool to see
into the heart of God,

13:25.541 --> 13:26.720
in the Christian tradition.

13:26.821 --> 13:28.297
And what other tradition is there?

13:28.322 --> 13:30.263
- Amen.
- Jesus said,

13:30.288 --> 13:32.793
"I am the way, the truth, the life.

13:32.894 --> 13:36.015
No one comes to the Father
except through me."

13:36.642 --> 13:38.198
Or do you not believe in Jesus anymore?

13:40.368 --> 13:42.471
- Kerissa, come on, now.
- It's just a question.

13:42.858 --> 13:44.118
And we're all family.

13:46.007 --> 13:47.643
What do you believe, Gigi?

13:47.823 --> 13:49.643
I'm actually interested to know.

13:50.812 --> 13:53.914
Well, I guess I believe

13:54.015 --> 13:55.769
there's a part of everything that tries.

13:58.085 --> 14:01.006
You know, like plants try to
grow, animals try to survive.

14:01.589 --> 14:03.557
People try to better
themselves to get ahead.

14:04.269 --> 14:06.326
Everything tries to do something.

14:06.427 --> 14:08.356
And I guess I think that...

14:09.997 --> 14:11.798
Christianity is just one way

14:11.899 --> 14:13.834
that the trying part
of people tries to connect

14:13.935 --> 14:15.748
with the trying part of everything else.

14:17.405 --> 14:18.538
Hear, hear. I'd go to that church.

14:18.639 --> 14:20.106
Me, too. Amen!

14:20.208 --> 14:21.775
I think that's marvelous.

14:21.876 --> 14:23.510
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Really, Bishop?

14:23.611 --> 14:24.945
Really, and I don't see any reason

14:25.046 --> 14:26.513
why that couldn't be
preached at Calvary.

14:26.614 --> 14:28.648
Well, I will give you one,

14:28.749 --> 14:30.483
because it has nothing to do with Jesus

14:30.585 --> 14:33.286
and the price he paid
on the cross for my sins.

14:33.387 --> 14:34.568
- Amen.
- Amen.

14:37.757 --> 14:39.526
I've got an idea for a sermon.

14:39.627 --> 14:40.745
You do?

14:41.195 --> 14:44.098
Yes. Remember?

14:44.632 --> 14:46.199
I told you.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.734
- Yeah.
- I've got an idea

14:47.835 --> 14:50.103
for a whole series of sermons, Daddy.

14:50.204 --> 14:51.791
It's a good one.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.708
Charity, we've been over this.

14:54.809 --> 14:56.776
I know, but you said

14:56.878 --> 14:59.546
that if I ever wanted to preach
a series, I'd need a theme.

14:59.647 --> 15:01.194
And I've got a theme now

15:01.295 --> 15:03.530
for a whole 12-part series.

15:04.285 --> 15:05.485
What is your theme, child?

15:05.586 --> 15:09.288
The seasons of Christian marriage.

15:09.389 --> 15:10.957
So, there are 12 seasons now?

15:13.957 --> 15:17.030
So, tell me, what would that be about?

15:17.131 --> 15:19.532
You know, it would be about

15:19.634 --> 15:21.768
how things change

15:21.869 --> 15:24.037
and grow deeper.

15:24.138 --> 15:27.070
And how with the help of God

15:27.901 --> 15:30.977
couples can push through tough times

15:31.078 --> 15:33.980
and experience all God has to offer.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.083
You've been married three years

15:37.184 --> 15:38.752
and you don't even have children.

15:38.853 --> 15:40.427
What do you know about tough times?

15:40.452 --> 15:42.055
I think it's a wonderful idea, Charity.

15:42.156 --> 15:45.047
Gigi, stay off of my team.

15:46.307 --> 15:47.761
Daddy, what do you think?

15:47.862 --> 15:49.129
Well, I...

15:49.743 --> 15:52.364
I think you're such
a wonderful singer, Charity,

15:52.466 --> 15:55.001
such a powerful exalter.

15:55.102 --> 15:56.736
And you preach twice a month

15:56.837 --> 15:58.538
to the little saints
in the children's church, right?

15:58.639 --> 15:59.703
Yeah.

16:00.875 --> 16:02.864
I'm a grown woman, Daddy.

16:03.678 --> 16:05.812
I want to preach a series, like Jacob,

16:05.913 --> 16:09.655
in the church on Sunday like a grown-up.

16:13.754 --> 16:14.921
Uh, Gigi.

16:15.022 --> 16:16.156
Daddy.

16:16.257 --> 16:17.424
How would you like to stay on

16:17.525 --> 16:19.626
and preach to the little saints?

16:19.727 --> 16:21.792
About what? Trying?

16:22.263 --> 16:25.198
Why won't you let me do a series?

16:25.639 --> 16:28.601
Jacob just did that one
on running the race

16:28.703 --> 16:31.137
or race to the finish.

16:31.238 --> 16:32.906
Finishing God's holy race.

16:33.007 --> 16:34.307
It's not like he's good at it.

16:34.408 --> 16:36.142
What? Come on, Charity.

16:36.243 --> 16:39.479
Why won't you give me a chance?

16:39.580 --> 16:41.648
Your daddy's made
his position clear, girl.

16:41.749 --> 16:42.916
Sit your ass down.

16:43.017 --> 16:44.517
Don't talk to her like that.

16:44.618 --> 16:46.128
Don't you talk to your uncle like that.

16:46.229 --> 16:48.722
Daddy, I think that Charity
is just trying to...

16:48.747 --> 16:49.738
Gigi!

16:50.291 --> 16:51.825
How many times do I have to tell you

16:51.926 --> 16:53.693
I don't need you looking out for me?

16:55.663 --> 16:57.263
I don't want your help.

17:00.501 --> 17:01.701
Charity. Charity, baby.

17:01.869 --> 17:03.403
Go on, go on.

17:05.638 --> 17:07.173
If you all would excuse me.

17:16.241 --> 17:17.116
What?

17:17.598 --> 17:19.651
I told you I didn't want trouble.

17:20.912 --> 17:22.688
Mama, the truth is trouble to you,

17:22.790 --> 17:24.126
and it always has been.

17:24.151 --> 17:27.227
Don't you dare start in
on me about the past,

17:27.328 --> 17:29.562
not when I just lost your sister.

17:29.978 --> 17:32.064
You didn't lose my sister, Mama.

17:32.166 --> 17:33.974
You gave her away!

17:34.568 --> 17:36.102
- Gigi...
- And you let him sit right here

17:36.203 --> 17:37.470
- at the table next to you!
- Gigi!

17:37.571 --> 17:39.940
- I swear to God...
- That is enough!

17:49.116 --> 17:51.217
We don't talk like that in my house.

17:51.318 --> 17:55.188
We do not swear to God.
This is not Arizona.

18:04.065 --> 18:05.598
You're going to church in the morning.

18:26.087 --> 18:27.921
Well, come on.

18:43.734 --> 18:44.570
Good night, Gigi.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.159
Jacob.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.808
- Uncle Mac.
- Uh-huh.

19:01.989 --> 19:03.539
I better be going.

19:04.132 --> 19:05.892
It's going to be a long drive home.

19:18.648 --> 19:20.215
So, how'd she look?

19:20.316 --> 19:22.040
Same. Older.

19:22.142 --> 19:23.672
Uh-huh.

19:24.474 --> 19:25.907
She's got nothing on you.

19:31.013 --> 19:32.981
You know, I could
stay tonight if you want.

19:33.082 --> 19:35.450
Stay? Like, stay over?

19:36.786 --> 19:39.621
Yeah, like, don't act so surprised.

19:39.722 --> 19:41.123
I'm not, it's just...

19:41.224 --> 19:42.730
Do you not want me to?

19:43.526 --> 19:44.926
I know it's a strange time,

19:45.027 --> 19:46.428
but I thought you might
like the company.

19:46.529 --> 19:48.497
I do. I want the company, totally.

19:48.598 --> 19:49.765
It's just...

19:49.866 --> 19:51.032
I thought we were waiting.

19:51.134 --> 19:52.167
We are waiting.

19:54.036 --> 19:56.138
Doesn't mean we can't wait together.

19:58.474 --> 19:59.574
Yeah.

20:01.698 --> 20:02.878
Stay.

20:05.248 --> 20:06.602
I'd like that.

20:07.804 --> 20:09.251
- Why the hell did you do that?
- Do what?

20:09.352 --> 20:10.819
Don't act like you don't
know what I'm talking about.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.354
Why'd you get all up on Gigi like that?

20:12.455 --> 20:13.989
Because I know how your daddy thinks

20:14.090 --> 20:15.357
and I wanted to be sure that he knows

20:15.458 --> 20:17.359
she's not a preacher anymore.

20:17.460 --> 20:19.161
She's leaving Monday, Kerissa.

20:19.262 --> 20:21.463
But he wishes she wasn't.

20:21.564 --> 20:22.798
And meantime, you get treated every day

20:22.899 --> 20:24.800
like some kind of broken glass

20:24.901 --> 20:28.003
while Grace shines on in his
memory crystal and complete.

20:28.104 --> 20:29.771
And you should be thanking me

20:29.872 --> 20:32.174
instead of getting all up
in my face about it.

20:32.275 --> 20:34.342
I'm the best friend
you got around here...

20:34.610 --> 20:36.050
the only real one.

20:36.747 --> 20:38.647
And you better tell
that little side piece

20:38.748 --> 20:40.916
to stop texting so damn much.

20:43.121 --> 20:44.753
I won't be disrespected.

20:56.552 --> 20:58.319
Hey, baby. How you doing?

21:00.174 --> 21:01.308
I'm all right.

21:03.665 --> 21:05.032
And what was that all about?

21:06.442 --> 21:07.976
This 12-part sermon series

21:08.077 --> 21:10.026
that you've been planning for so long?

21:11.145 --> 21:12.699
I've thought about it.

21:14.644 --> 21:16.785
Seasons of Christian marriage?

21:17.671 --> 21:19.087
I swear.

21:22.491 --> 21:24.392
Was that all just to impress Gigi?

21:26.295 --> 21:27.827
You tell me.

21:28.364 --> 21:31.466
You're the one who was in such
a hurry to go to her church.

21:31.567 --> 21:33.458
Aw, come on, baby.

21:33.936 --> 21:35.503
You know I didn't mean it.

21:35.605 --> 21:37.913
It's just that Kerissa
was going at her so hard.

21:40.222 --> 21:41.322
You know me.

21:45.782 --> 21:46.787
Look, tell you what.

21:48.537 --> 21:50.105
Why don't we go upstairs,

21:51.025 --> 21:52.888
make a big bowl of ice cream...

21:55.384 --> 21:56.585
with chocolate syrup...

22:01.464 --> 22:03.198
cuddle up and watch "The Bachelor"?

22:07.536 --> 22:08.937
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22:16.565 --> 22:18.666
I just can't believe she's gone.

22:22.251 --> 22:23.451
I know, baby.

22:25.421 --> 22:26.554
I know.

22:43.073 --> 22:44.440
So, what is this thing?

22:44.907 --> 22:47.030
An old lookout tower from the Civil War.

22:47.576 --> 22:49.044
Were there slaves here back then?

22:49.145 --> 22:51.118
Yeah, there were slaves
all over Tennessee.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.852
This whole estate used to belong

22:57.954 --> 22:59.854
to an old lady called Miss Davis.

22:59.956 --> 23:01.883
When she was killed,
it turned out that...

23:01.984 --> 23:04.117
- Killed?
- Yeah.

23:04.218 --> 23:06.422
- Are you serious?
- She was murdered.

23:06.524 --> 23:09.898
- By who?
- Some random guys.

23:10.603 --> 23:11.599
What are you doing?

23:12.049 --> 23:13.722
Ritalin. Want some?

23:43.845 --> 23:45.546
Do you have ADD or ADHD?

23:47.203 --> 23:49.904
Neither, but I told my doctor I did.

23:50.006 --> 23:52.193
I was like, "I can't concentrate.

23:52.295 --> 23:54.220
I keep interrupting
my friends when they talk.

23:54.321 --> 23:55.510
It's pissing them off."

23:55.611 --> 23:57.078
He still wouldn't give it to me,

23:57.179 --> 23:58.680
so I finally said,

23:58.781 --> 24:00.682
"If I don't start crossing
things off my to-do list,

24:00.783 --> 24:02.283
I might hurt myself."

24:02.385 --> 24:03.651
Bam.

24:05.621 --> 24:08.189
- Why do you take it?
- My mom's school.

24:09.992 --> 24:11.126
It's all you.

24:21.003 --> 24:22.431
Nice form.

24:23.534 --> 24:25.540
If you don't keep your grades
up or get in too much trouble,

24:25.641 --> 24:27.342
then you get in the red zone.

24:27.443 --> 24:30.311
Then your name goes up on a
bulletin board in the lobby.

24:30.757 --> 24:34.282
My mom's the principal.
I can't be in the red zone.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.239
Feel anything?

24:41.824 --> 24:43.591
I think so, yeah. Yeah.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.557
I love Jesus so much.

25:04.229 --> 25:05.930
What's the matter?

25:06.031 --> 25:07.498
It's just a lot harder than I thought,

25:07.599 --> 25:08.733
having you stay over.

25:08.834 --> 25:11.335
Why? I like it.

25:14.272 --> 25:16.374
So do I, but it's...

25:16.475 --> 25:18.709
you know, we're getting to that
point where we can't do anything.

25:18.810 --> 25:20.911
Who says we can't do anything?

25:21.013 --> 25:23.094
We can't do one thing.

25:23.982 --> 25:25.957
That leaves a whole lot of options.

25:27.486 --> 25:29.120
Unless, of course,
you don't like options.

25:29.221 --> 25:30.388
Oh, oh, oh, no.

25:30.489 --> 25:31.637
No.

25:32.557 --> 25:34.125
I'll take an option.

26:19.671 --> 26:22.206
I feel bad for Stacey G.

26:22.307 --> 26:24.575
- Don't you?
- Hmm?

26:24.676 --> 26:27.912
Everybody knows
he's going to pick Stacey B.

26:28.013 --> 26:30.781
Stacey G. is just somebody to say no to.

26:37.322 --> 26:39.390
What are you doing?

26:39.491 --> 26:41.825
They're just about to go
into the fantasy suite.

26:45.444 --> 26:46.577
Do you want to have a baby?

26:49.653 --> 26:50.787
Do you?

26:52.003 --> 26:53.846
You want to now?

26:54.539 --> 26:56.373
I wouldn't ask if I didn't.

27:00.407 --> 27:03.687
I guess it would be a good time to...

27:05.095 --> 27:07.806
you know, make a new life.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.187
Yeah.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.191
Yeah, I think so, too.

27:14.792 --> 27:15.611
Yeah?

27:15.712 --> 27:16.694
Yeah.

27:16.795 --> 27:18.229
Okay.

27:32.411 --> 27:33.544
What, James?

27:36.188 --> 27:37.588
Did we do the wrong thing?

27:43.522 --> 27:45.589
We did the best we could.

27:53.198 --> 27:54.565
Yeah.

28:16.555 --> 28:17.922
Auntie.

28:20.425 --> 28:22.459
Oh.

28:27.766 --> 28:30.501
- So good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

28:30.602 --> 28:32.069
Oh!

28:34.573 --> 28:36.390
Well, the place hasn't changed much.

28:36.930 --> 28:38.475
It's about to.

28:38.577 --> 28:40.110
I'm getting ready to renovate.

28:40.212 --> 28:42.085
Going to knock out that wall over there,

28:42.186 --> 28:43.981
add a new line of banquettes over there,

28:44.082 --> 28:45.482
new stage lights.

28:45.584 --> 28:46.851
Just waiting on the permit.

28:46.952 --> 28:48.118
I like it the way it is.

28:48.220 --> 28:50.206
Well, I will take a picture.

28:52.524 --> 28:54.105
Remember the first time
you came in here?

28:54.206 --> 28:56.694
- Yeah.
- We sat right here.

28:56.795 --> 28:59.282
Auntie, you know I was scared to death.

28:59.383 --> 29:01.899
Mama's always talking
about her evil sister Mavis

29:02.000 --> 29:04.657
purveying the devil's music
down on Beale Street.

29:05.050 --> 29:06.753
I figured I had to come see for myself.

29:07.541 --> 29:10.133
I used to make you those little
Shirley Temples, remember?

29:10.235 --> 29:12.188
And you would sit
and you would sip on them.

29:12.316 --> 29:14.611
So serious. Mmm.

29:14.986 --> 29:18.722
- So dignified.
- Aw.

29:18.823 --> 29:20.690
You weren't anything like Mama said.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.425
Nothing is.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.293
Ugh.

29:26.397 --> 29:27.697
Did, um...

29:27.798 --> 29:28.999
did Faith ever come in here?

29:29.425 --> 29:31.330
She moved down
to this neighborhood, right?

29:31.802 --> 29:32.924
She did.

29:33.779 --> 29:35.705
But after she moved out of the house,

29:35.806 --> 29:39.050
she started moving in her own circles.

29:40.730 --> 29:41.977
Yeah.

29:42.079 --> 29:44.180
Nothing you could do about that.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.571
Nothing.

29:46.317 --> 29:47.755
She had her own path,

29:48.986 --> 29:50.720
and we both know
who's to blame for that.

29:52.823 --> 29:54.076
Yeah.

29:59.030 --> 30:00.297
So, what's going on?

30:00.398 --> 30:01.631
Hey, y'all!

30:01.732 --> 30:03.733
Give it up for Mr. Anthony David!

30:03.834 --> 30:05.302
Your Uncle Mac.

30:05.903 --> 30:07.304
What?

30:11.342 --> 30:13.031
He did it again?

30:14.145 --> 30:16.647
Honestly, Gigi, I don't think
he ever really stopped.

30:17.848 --> 30:19.749
Every couple of years you hear rumors

30:19.850 --> 30:22.452
about some girl he's mixed up with.

30:22.553 --> 30:24.354
Nothing ever comes of it.

30:24.455 --> 30:25.789
I didn't even bother to tell you.

30:26.359 --> 30:29.358
But two months ago,

30:29.460 --> 30:33.055
one of the cops who works
around here came to see me

30:34.465 --> 30:39.169
and told me about a 15-year-old
girl from the church

30:39.270 --> 30:42.189
who had come in and gave a statement.

30:42.873 --> 30:44.007
And what happened?

30:44.108 --> 30:46.176
Nothing. She recanted.

30:46.942 --> 30:48.277
After three days,

30:48.379 --> 30:49.746
said she made the whole thing up.

30:51.749 --> 30:52.882
Just like Faith.

30:57.688 --> 30:59.089
Why are you telling me this?

30:59.747 --> 31:01.358
Because right now

31:01.459 --> 31:02.959
I'm the only person in this family

31:03.060 --> 31:06.419
that knows that happened besides Mac.

31:07.498 --> 31:10.266
And you are the only one

31:10.368 --> 31:11.898
who can do something about it.

31:24.963 --> 31:27.216
Senator Banks and his aids is here to see
you sir.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.945
Gentlemen, to what
do I owe this pleasure?

31:30.046 --> 31:32.948
And if it has anything to do with
that police officer David Nelson,

31:33.049 --> 31:35.061
- I can't help you.
- It doesn't.

31:35.086 --> 31:36.743
Well, praise God, that's a blessing,

31:36.977 --> 31:39.009
'cause Lord knows I've had
enough heartache lately.

31:39.110 --> 31:41.261
The Senate is launching
an inquiry, James,

31:41.362 --> 31:43.089
into whether your church
and others like it

31:43.190 --> 31:45.686
are taking advantage
of your tax-exempt status

31:45.787 --> 31:48.667
to bilk the American people
out of billions of dollars.

31:50.389 --> 31:52.013
- For real?
- For real.

31:53.632 --> 31:54.452
What?

31:54.660 --> 31:56.428
Well, I'm just wondering,

31:56.973 --> 31:58.589
what are white people going to think

31:58.614 --> 32:00.739
when they see black people
picking on each other like this?

32:01.587 --> 32:03.488
What will black people
think if we don't?

32:03.589 --> 32:05.356
There are white churches
on there, too, James.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.659
- Have a look.
- Give me that thing. Let me see.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.664
Where's Basie Skanks?

32:13.899 --> 32:15.333
His church is growing like a weed.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.136
He just said he was
buying that old YMCA.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.872
We're not talking about Triumph
Church or Basie Skanks.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.808
We're talking about you and Calvary.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.145
I don't see what's wrong.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.147
If everything is in order,

32:29.248 --> 32:30.648
there shouldn't be a problem.

32:36.221 --> 32:37.321
There isn't.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.759
Alexa, show the senator out, please.

32:42.239 --> 32:43.293
Right this way.

33:00.318 --> 33:01.732
I got you.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.582
Hi. How's it going?
Got everything under control?

33:04.683 --> 33:06.451
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.654
Alexa!

33:12.291 --> 33:13.958
- Pastor Greenleaf.
- You got a minute?

33:14.059 --> 33:16.127
Your father needs his Bible.

33:16.228 --> 33:17.762
It'll only take a second.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.430
It's about the special offering.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.406
♪ Confused in my head

33:39.418 --> 33:41.786
♪ It should have been me...

34:56.929 --> 34:58.629
Hallelujah!

34:58.731 --> 34:59.931
Oh!

Oh!

35:04.428 --> 35:06.096
Yeah!

35:07.706 --> 35:10.241
Has God given me a message

35:10.342 --> 35:12.276
for the people of God today!

35:12.378 --> 35:14.120
Hallelujah!

35:15.326 --> 35:17.761
And amen! Amen!

35:18.984 --> 35:20.148
Now...

35:20.652 --> 35:24.647
Now, this goes back
to when Lady Mae and me

35:24.672 --> 35:26.724
were still flying commercial.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.727
Never again. Thank you, Jesus.

35:29.828 --> 35:33.231
First lady
says, "Never again, Thank you Jesus."

35:33.332 --> 35:37.034
And this man sees me
poring over my Bible.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.637
I was getting ready
for my sermon on Sunday.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.839
And he grunts at me,

35:42.391 --> 35:44.075
sipping on his wine,

35:44.176 --> 35:47.005
said, "Are you one
of them Bible bangers?"

35:47.832 --> 35:50.848
I said, "Well, what's a Bible banger?"

35:50.949 --> 35:52.450
He said, "You know, one of those people

35:52.551 --> 35:55.386
that bangs people on the head
with their Bible."

35:55.488 --> 35:57.655
And this made me so sad

35:57.756 --> 36:00.658
to think that's what
the Bible is to some people,

36:00.759 --> 36:03.494
something they think someone's
going to be beating on them with.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.091
Beating them on the head.

36:05.193 --> 36:09.934
Now, imagine that you were
born in a real small town,

36:10.035 --> 36:12.069
and on the first day of kindergarten

36:12.171 --> 36:13.671
you're standing on the milk line,

36:14.210 --> 36:16.607
and the little kid next to you in line

36:16.708 --> 36:18.303
says hi and starts talking to you.

36:18.405 --> 36:21.646
And it turns out that he likes
the same cartoons as you.

36:21.747 --> 36:22.880
Yeah!

36:22.981 --> 36:24.916
The same flavor ice cream.

36:25.823 --> 36:27.517
Same video games.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.054
It's like you two
were made for each other.

36:30.467 --> 36:34.358
So you start to go to each
other's houses after school

36:34.460 --> 36:37.228
and you become friends... best friends.

36:37.329 --> 36:38.984
That's right! That's right!

36:39.085 --> 36:41.332
And then when it comes time
to graduate from high school,

36:41.433 --> 36:45.169
now you have to stay in town
because of a family business

36:45.270 --> 36:47.360
and your friend goes off to college

36:48.540 --> 36:50.975
and then gets a job on the
other side of the world.

36:51.831 --> 36:53.383
But you keep in touch,

36:54.012 --> 36:57.715
email each other once a week or so.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.417
And at the end of every email,

37:00.123 --> 37:01.759
you say, "I love you.

37:02.187 --> 37:04.489
I miss you. Please come home."

37:05.606 --> 37:07.225
After many years of this,

37:07.326 --> 37:09.727
one day you get an email
from your friend.

37:09.828 --> 37:12.630
He says, "I have some business

37:12.731 --> 37:14.198
going to take me through your area,

37:14.299 --> 37:15.867
and I was wondering if I could see you."

37:15.968 --> 37:17.359
Yes.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.170
So, on the day your friend
is coming to visit,

37:19.613 --> 37:23.908
you drive three hours to the big airport

37:24.009 --> 37:28.012
and you stand there outside security
by the baggage claim and you wait.

37:29.757 --> 37:32.482
Now, all these people
are coming through the doors.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.486
And you think, "Well,
maybe there's a problem."

37:36.822 --> 37:37.989
"Maybe I got the date wrong."

37:38.090 --> 37:41.559
But then, way back...

37:41.660 --> 37:43.361
at the back of this river of people,

37:43.462 --> 37:44.962
you see your friend.

37:45.063 --> 37:48.149
And, oh, how your heart fills!

37:48.909 --> 37:52.041
You see, the Bible is not a rulebook!

37:52.142 --> 37:55.139
The Bible is not a bunch of myths!

37:55.240 --> 37:56.807
It's not even a work of literature!

37:58.477 --> 37:59.744
And it certainly isn't something

37:59.845 --> 38:02.223
to be banging people over the head with.

38:02.848 --> 38:05.312
The Bible, praise God,

38:06.051 --> 38:07.952
is like a bunch of emails

38:08.053 --> 38:10.964
from the best friend
you ever had saying,

38:10.989 --> 38:13.591
"I love you! I miss you.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.693
Please, come home!"

38:15.794 --> 38:18.029
Preach!

38:25.470 --> 38:27.538
Now, I don't know who
I'm preaching to today.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.374
Maybe I'm preaching to myself.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.977
But if there's anybody out there today

38:33.078 --> 38:36.380
who's thinking, "I want to come home.

38:36.481 --> 38:40.985
I'm so tired of being
out there by myself,

38:41.086 --> 38:42.920
fighting by myself!

38:43.021 --> 38:45.623
I just want to go home
and see my friend."

38:45.724 --> 38:48.125
Well, I'm here to tell you,
come on home!

38:48.964 --> 38:50.628
Come down here,

38:50.729 --> 38:53.497
because Jesus wants to welcome you home!

38:55.300 --> 38:56.601
Come on!

38:56.702 --> 38:58.435
Come on down here.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.272
Come on down here.

39:01.373 --> 39:04.253
Come on, while there's still time!

39:05.077 --> 39:06.577
Come on!

39:06.678 --> 39:07.845
Come on down!

39:07.946 --> 39:10.445
Come on down here, child.

39:10.983 --> 39:12.550
Praise Jesus.

39:12.651 --> 39:13.918
That's right, come on.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.455
Oh, come on.

39:17.556 --> 39:19.156
- Daddy.
- Come on, Gigi.

39:19.257 --> 39:22.093
♪ Take me to the river...

39:22.194 --> 39:25.763
You know how this works, Gigi.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.565
Just pray with me, child.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.367
Heavenly Father, we thank Thee...

39:31.236 --> 39:33.537
- ♪ Take me...
- Welcome home, baby.

39:33.639 --> 39:36.307
♪ Take me to the river...

39:36.408 --> 39:38.251
Bishop, over here.

39:39.611 --> 39:40.778
Excuse me, child.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.213
Daddy gonna be right back, hear?

39:42.314 --> 39:44.108
Okay.

39:44.850 --> 39:48.152
♪ Take me to the river

39:48.253 --> 39:50.821
♪ Take me to your river...

39:52.357 --> 39:55.259
- ♪ I want to know...
- Beloved!

39:55.360 --> 39:58.062
Praise God! Ha ha!

39:58.163 --> 40:00.431
Beloved, now,
these saints of the church,

40:00.532 --> 40:02.266
Claire and Horace Jackson,

40:02.367 --> 40:05.036
who we all know just won
themselves that Powerball...

40:05.137 --> 40:07.071
Hallelujah!

40:07.172 --> 40:09.040
...who could have run off this weekend

40:09.141 --> 40:12.576
and blown it all on riches
that rust and fade away,

40:12.678 --> 40:15.379
but instead they came to
church like regular folk

40:15.480 --> 40:18.449
to drop a deposit
into the bank of eternity

40:18.550 --> 40:20.818
to the tune of $50,000!

40:20.919 --> 40:24.588
Praise God! Boom!

40:24.690 --> 40:27.258
Dropping like the atomic bomb!

40:27.359 --> 40:29.260
- Boom!
- Boom!

40:29.361 --> 40:31.062
Right into the pit of Hell.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.897
- Boom!
- Boom!

40:32.998 --> 40:37.399
Breaking down those walls
and setting captives free!

40:37.501 --> 40:40.471
- Boom!
- Boom!

40:40.572 --> 40:44.475
The Lord God of hosts proclaims,

40:44.576 --> 40:48.290
"You're not going to keep my
saints bound up down there!"

40:48.391 --> 40:51.682
Not today, Satan! Not today!

40:51.783 --> 40:53.484
Praise God!

40:53.585 --> 40:56.087
Oh, yes!

40:56.188 --> 40:57.421
Amen!

41:01.827 --> 41:03.094
Church good?

41:03.195 --> 41:04.795
Listen, that girl you mentioned,

41:04.896 --> 41:07.098
the one from the church
who gave her statement?

41:07.571 --> 41:09.538
You think your friend from the
force can get me her name?

41:11.169 --> 41:12.174
I can ask,

41:12.276 --> 41:14.676
but you got to promise me something.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.654
You won't run away
like you did last time.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.146
I promise.

41:25.689 --> 41:27.251
♪ Satan

41:33.325 --> 41:34.959
♪ Lord Jesus

41:35.060 --> 41:38.129
♪ Oh, oh, Satan

41:43.735 --> 41:45.236
♪ Oh, yes

41:45.337 --> 41:47.838

41:51.910 --> 41:55.813
