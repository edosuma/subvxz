00:01.601 --> 00:03.868
Welcome back to bachelor week
right here on <i>tool time.</i>

00:03.869 --> 00:07.105
If you remember,
yesterday tim showed us
how to shave in the car

00:07.106 --> 00:09.040
When you're running behind.

00:13.746 --> 00:15.446
Today, it's al's turn,

00:15.447 --> 00:17.548
With a look at
the rough-and-tumble
world of...

00:17.549 --> 00:19.084
Ironing.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.720
Now, ironing used to be
a woman's domain.
But not these days.

00:21.721 --> 00:23.855
Because they won't
do it for us anymore.

00:23.856 --> 00:27.125
More importantly,
a man should know how
to do his own ironing.

00:27.126 --> 00:29.694
Now, I think of an iron
as just another tool.

00:29.695 --> 00:31.863
You can even hang it
from your tool belt.

00:31.864 --> 00:33.865
But you don't want
to plug it in,

00:33.866 --> 00:37.235
'cause there are certain
things you don't want ironed.

00:37.236 --> 00:40.739
Historically, men have been
ironing for ages.

00:40.740 --> 00:44.142
The first irons were made
of iron heated by fire.

00:44.143 --> 00:46.611
This iron here was developed
to be heated by coal.

00:46.612 --> 00:48.279
Then came the nine irons,

00:48.280 --> 00:50.882
Your tire irons,

00:50.883 --> 00:53.484
And my personal favorite,
your jeremy irons.

00:53.485 --> 00:55.053
He's so wonderful.

00:56.722 --> 00:58.823
All right. Let's get
to ironing technique.

00:58.824 --> 01:00.591
I like to start
with the sleeve

01:00.592 --> 01:02.260
And move on to the body
of the shirt.

01:02.261 --> 01:03.928
Marv, if you want
to come in here.

01:03.929 --> 01:07.365
I also like to start
with a light spray
from my mist button.

01:07.366 --> 01:09.100
Let me show you
how the pros do it.

01:09.101 --> 01:10.468
I'm talking about
the european tailors,

01:10.469 --> 01:12.503
Chinese tailors,
hong kong tailors.

01:12.504 --> 01:14.839
Tim taylors.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.876
We use the old gravity-feed
professional iron.

01:17.877 --> 01:19.477
Yeah.

01:21.914 --> 01:25.817
1,000 watts,
120 volts, 275 degrees.

01:25.818 --> 01:28.953
<i>(grunts)</i>

01:28.954 --> 01:30.955
I like a little starch
in my shirt,

01:30.956 --> 01:32.557
So I'll starch her up.

01:32.558 --> 01:35.393
Actually, tim,
too much starch can
irritate the skin.

01:35.394 --> 01:38.429
Yeah. Too much al
can irritate tim.

01:40.833 --> 01:42.834
If you iron like al,
it'll take forever.

01:42.835 --> 01:46.404
European way,
professional way,
do it quick.

01:46.405 --> 01:49.273
Steam going there.

02:00.285 --> 02:02.353
And there you go.

02:57.709 --> 03:00.344
<i>(brad)</i> my life is over.

03:00.345 --> 03:03.081
Randy, I've got a pimple.

03:05.584 --> 03:07.752
I don't see anything.

03:07.753 --> 03:10.655
It's one of those
under-the-skin ones.

03:12.091 --> 03:15.493
It's gonna come out
tomorrow.

03:15.494 --> 03:18.496
Well, maybe we can throw it
a coming-out party.

03:19.899 --> 03:23.567
Invite all the other pimples
in the neighborhood.

03:23.568 --> 03:25.003
Randy, you don't
understand.

03:25.004 --> 03:28.072
Tomorrow night's my date
with jessica lutz.

03:28.073 --> 03:29.874
What am I gonna do?

03:29.875 --> 03:34.012
Send her fries
and a chocolate bar,
hope she breaks out too.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.281
Hey, guys.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.782
Hi, dad.

03:37.783 --> 03:39.450
I got a pimple
on my nose,

03:39.451 --> 03:41.385
And I got a date
with jessica lutz.

03:41.386 --> 03:43.254
Come on. If she's
a real woman,

03:43.255 --> 03:45.223
She's not gonna notice
a little zit on your nose.

03:45.224 --> 03:47.458
She's a 14-year-old girl.

03:47.459 --> 03:49.961
You're in trouble.
Big, big trouble.

03:49.962 --> 03:51.830
What works for me
is a hot compress,

03:51.831 --> 03:53.631
You bring the zit
to the surface, you pop it,

03:53.632 --> 03:56.634
Ding dong, the zit is dead.

03:56.635 --> 03:59.470
Cool! Come on, randy,
let's go soak my pimple.

03:59.471 --> 04:03.141
Brad, I'm looking
for a hobby,
but that's not it.

04:05.577 --> 04:07.578
Hi, sweetie.

04:07.579 --> 04:09.413
Hey, baby.
Hi.

04:09.414 --> 04:12.416
You're a little late.
Mm-hmm. I took my teacher
judith out for coffee.

04:12.417 --> 04:14.252
Great move!

04:14.253 --> 04:18.189
That'll guarantee you a c,
but if you want the a,
you gotta give cash.

04:18.190 --> 04:22.426
That's not why I'm doing it.
I really like her.

04:22.427 --> 04:24.428
That's great. Anyway,
I'm doing the hot rod.

04:24.429 --> 04:26.831
I got the dash panel up.
Wanna take a look at it?

04:26.832 --> 04:30.601
I just hate knowing
that judith's going home
to an empty house, though.

04:30.602 --> 04:33.738
A wonderful woman like that
should not be alone.

04:35.807 --> 04:38.943
You know who would be
perfect for her?

04:38.944 --> 04:40.211
Wilson.

04:40.212 --> 04:42.446
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, no!

04:42.447 --> 04:44.315
You keep your filthy little
mitts off wilson

04:44.316 --> 04:45.950
Admit it, I'm on a roll.

04:45.951 --> 04:47.718
I'm the one who set up
al and ilene.

04:47.719 --> 04:49.820
You could have set al up
with a mop with a wig on,

04:49.821 --> 04:52.623
He would've been happy.

04:52.624 --> 04:54.458
As a matter of fact,
I think you did.

04:54.459 --> 04:57.962
They went to chicago.
He had a great time
with her.

04:57.963 --> 04:59.463
Wilson is lonely.

04:59.464 --> 05:01.232
I think he likes being alone.

05:01.233 --> 05:03.234
Besides, you just
can't set wilson up

05:03.235 --> 05:05.069
With some woman
off the street.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.804
She's not just some woman
off the street.

05:06.805 --> 05:08.907
She's faced incredible
adversity.

05:08.908 --> 05:10.741
Her husband left her alone

05:10.742 --> 05:13.912
With two children
and no money when she was
24 years old.

05:13.913 --> 05:15.646
She still managed
to get a ph.D.

05:15.647 --> 05:18.783
Like that's hard to do.

05:18.784 --> 05:21.419
What exactly
is your problem here?

05:21.420 --> 05:23.421
What exactly do you know
about this woman?

05:23.422 --> 05:24.923
Ph.D., a couple of kids -

05:24.924 --> 05:26.590
What about
the important things?

05:26.591 --> 05:28.559
What kind of car
does she drive?

05:28.560 --> 05:31.396
I don't know.
Some sort of station wagon.

05:31.397 --> 05:34.432
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

05:34.433 --> 05:37.402
I dated a station wagon once.
It was a nightmare.

05:37.403 --> 05:41.539
Tim, I'm setting her up
with wilson, not with you.

05:41.540 --> 05:45.176
Well, if she's lonely,
have her get her own wilson.

05:45.177 --> 05:47.178
Aha!

05:47.179 --> 05:49.314
I see what's going on here.

05:49.315 --> 05:52.150
You're afraid that
if wilson spends time
with judith,

05:52.151 --> 05:54.752
He's not gonna have
any time for you.

05:58.457 --> 06:01.826
If they got married
and went on a honeymoon,
who would I talk to?

06:01.827 --> 06:04.895
It could be a very
difficult week for me.

06:07.799 --> 06:11.569
Well, that's true,
because then we'd
have to talk,

06:11.570 --> 06:16.207
And that would be
a very difficult
week for me.

06:21.947 --> 06:23.181
Hey, wilson.

06:23.182 --> 06:26.250
Well, hi-ho, neighborette.

06:26.251 --> 06:27.751
What are you doing?

06:27.752 --> 06:29.253
Well, I'm hanging replicas

06:29.254 --> 06:31.089
Of ancient clay bells
from crete.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.091
They're supposed to
attract friendly spirits.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.259
What do you know?
Here I am.

06:35.260 --> 06:36.927
<i>(chuckles)</i>

06:36.928 --> 06:38.762
You know, I know we're
supposed to go over

06:38.763 --> 06:40.598
To your house for dinner
tomorrow night,

06:40.599 --> 06:42.766
But I was wondering
if you'd like to come
over to ours instead.

06:42.767 --> 06:44.668
Well, I do appreciate
the invite,

06:44.669 --> 06:48.806
But I've already
made the koftas for
my malai kofta curry.

06:48.807 --> 06:50.441
Oh.

06:50.442 --> 06:52.377
I just wanted
to introduce you

06:52.378 --> 06:54.712
To this professor
that I really like.

06:54.713 --> 06:56.714
Well, I have
a cornucopia of koftas.

06:56.715 --> 06:58.582
Why doesn't
the good professor
come over to my place?

06:58.583 --> 07:00.184
That would be great!

07:00.185 --> 07:02.353
You are really gonna
like her, wilson.

07:06.892 --> 07:08.592
Her?

07:08.593 --> 07:11.462
Yeah. She is incredible.

07:11.463 --> 07:14.899
She's funny, and smart,
extremely attractive,

07:14.900 --> 07:17.035
And extremely available.

07:17.036 --> 07:19.937
Jill, this wouldn't
by any chance be
a setup, would it?

07:19.938 --> 07:25.143
A setup? No. No, no, no.
Definitely not a setup.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.978
Well, I guess it'd be ok,
as long as there's
no pressure.

07:27.979 --> 07:30.714
Absolutely none.
Good.

07:30.715 --> 07:33.651
Although you might wanna
wear those gray slacks

07:33.652 --> 07:36.454
And that blue sweater
that brings out the color
of blue in your eyes.

07:36.455 --> 07:39.757
And you should puff up
your hair, 'cause you
get that hat-head thing.

07:44.763 --> 07:46.897
Thanks, dad.

07:57.342 --> 07:59.343
Because of your
hot compress idea,

07:59.344 --> 08:02.346
My zit is the size
of a tomato.

08:02.347 --> 08:04.715
I knew it'd bring
the blood to the surface.

08:04.716 --> 08:07.785
I didn't think it'd make
a permanent home there.

08:07.786 --> 08:11.389
Little kids are gonna
come up to me and think
that I'm a clown.

08:11.390 --> 08:14.959
Come on, brad, get over it.
They're not gonna do that.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.727
Just in case, maybe
you should practice

08:16.728 --> 08:19.797
Making those little
balloon animals.

08:19.798 --> 08:21.232
This is a nightmare.

08:21.233 --> 08:23.334
I'm going out with jessica
in a half an hour.

08:23.335 --> 08:27.405
Ok. This problem
needs a woman's touch.

08:27.406 --> 08:29.673
Brad?

08:29.674 --> 08:31.742
Wake up to makeup.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.980
No, no.
I am not wearing makeup.

08:35.981 --> 08:39.150
If I were you, I'd be
open to suggestions.

08:41.852 --> 08:44.655
Rudolph.

08:46.992 --> 08:48.493
<i>(wilson)</i> welcome, taylors!

08:48.494 --> 08:52.463
My, my, my,
what a lovely bromeliad.

08:52.464 --> 08:54.832
<i>(tim)</i> wilson, I'm sorry
jill roped you into this.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.801
I did not rope him into this.
He's excited.
Aren't you excited?

08:57.802 --> 08:59.403
Well, actually,
I'm quite nervous.

08:59.404 --> 09:02.206
I haven't really
dated in 20 years.

09:02.207 --> 09:04.208
Well, I can give you
some pointers.

09:04.209 --> 09:05.543
Oh, great.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.878
This from the man who,
on our first date,

09:07.879 --> 09:11.415
Brought me a bouquet
of spark plugs.

09:11.416 --> 09:13.417
No, really, wilson.
When you're dating a woman,

09:13.418 --> 09:15.886
They like to hear
stories that tell
how sensitive you are.

09:15.887 --> 09:17.555
I knocked jill out
with this one

09:17.556 --> 09:19.590
Where I saved a little
kitty-cat drowning
in a river.

09:19.591 --> 09:20.891
Remember that?

09:20.892 --> 09:23.194
You said
it was an old lady.

09:23.195 --> 09:26.430
Kitty-cat, old lady.
You married me, didn't you?

09:26.431 --> 09:30.368
Don't listen to him.
Just be yourself.

09:30.369 --> 09:33.704
You know, tell her about
all that interesting
stuff that you do.

09:33.705 --> 09:36.574
Well, maybe I could tell her
of the time I was in india

09:36.575 --> 09:39.243
And danced naked
while my body was pierced

09:39.244 --> 09:42.246
By the swords of siva.

09:42.247 --> 09:46.384
Then again, you don't want
to reveal too much
on your first date.

09:46.385 --> 09:50.655
<i>(gong and panpipe doorbell)</i>

09:54.826 --> 09:57.595
Ok, I'll get it.
<i>(wilson groans)</i>

09:57.596 --> 10:00.398
Oh, my.

10:00.399 --> 10:01.699
Are you ok?

10:01.700 --> 10:04.902
Actually, I'm experiencing
extreme diaphoresis.

10:07.472 --> 10:10.174
I'm sweating like a pig.

10:10.175 --> 10:13.611
Thank you.
Judith, this is
my husband, tim.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.446
Hello, judith.
Nice to meet you.

10:15.447 --> 10:17.114
Nice to meet you.
How's jill at school?

10:17.115 --> 10:18.782
Does she listen to
and follow directions?

10:18.783 --> 10:21.452
Work and play well
with others?

10:21.453 --> 10:25.289
Yes, but she gets
a little rambunctious
during nap time.

10:25.290 --> 10:28.759
You should see her
at home. Whoa!

10:32.497 --> 10:34.699
And this is wilson.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.767
Well, nice to meet you.
You too.

10:36.768 --> 10:40.003
Jill has told me
so much about you.
It's all been great.

10:40.004 --> 10:41.472
Well, I am flattered.

10:41.473 --> 10:43.807
The only thing she didn't
tell me was your last name.

10:43.808 --> 10:46.477
It's wilson.
I thought that was
your first name.

10:46.478 --> 10:49.413
Wilson is my first name.

10:51.483 --> 10:53.451
Well...

10:53.452 --> 10:58.322
It's not that unusual.
I'm actually tim tim.
This is jill jill.

10:58.323 --> 11:01.425
Sorry sorry.

11:01.426 --> 11:03.427
Would you like
some white wine?

11:03.428 --> 11:04.595
Yes, please.

11:04.596 --> 11:06.330
I'll give you a hand.
Sure.

11:06.331 --> 11:09.267
This is a very interesting
house, wilson.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.636
Or should I
call you "wilson"?

11:13.538 --> 11:16.006
Judith, in addition
to being my professor,

11:16.007 --> 11:18.942
Mentor, friend, is also
a renowned author.

11:18.943 --> 11:22.045
Oh, hardly renowned.
My book sold about
four copies.

11:22.046 --> 11:24.548
Two of which were
to my children.

11:24.549 --> 11:26.216
I wrote a book once.

11:26.217 --> 11:29.086
<i>How to maintain</i>
<i>your bench grinder.</i>

11:30.255 --> 11:32.623
That sold no copies.

11:32.624 --> 11:34.592
Well, it was probably more
exciting than my book.

11:34.593 --> 11:38.696
It was called
<i>the psychophysiological indices</i>
<i>of amorous connections...</i>

11:38.697 --> 11:41.599
<i>Among termites</i>
<i>of the southwest.</i>

11:41.600 --> 11:43.668
How did you know that?

11:43.669 --> 11:47.938
Because I have read it.
It is wonderful!

11:47.939 --> 11:49.640
I mean, it's practically
the bible

11:49.641 --> 11:52.376
For anyone interested in
the mating pattern of insects.

11:52.377 --> 11:54.978
All two of you.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.249
You see,
I am quite the devotee

11:59.250 --> 12:02.252
Of what I humorously term
"insexuality."

12:02.253 --> 12:04.455
<i>(judith laughs)</i>

12:04.456 --> 12:06.424
I can't believe
you actually read my book.

12:06.425 --> 12:08.258
I've got it right here.
I'll show you.

12:08.259 --> 12:10.361
We'll have to talk
some insects over dinner.

12:10.362 --> 12:14.932
Yeah. 'cause usually
over here we eat
insects for dinner.

12:14.933 --> 12:16.767
<i>(wilson)</i> here it is.

12:19.671 --> 12:21.539
You even dog-eared the pages.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.607
Now it's my turn
to be flattered.

12:23.608 --> 12:25.175
<i>(chuckles)</i>

12:29.147 --> 12:31.682
I gotta start

12:39.290 --> 12:42.059
♪ I didn't want to do it

12:42.060 --> 12:45.796
♪ you made me want you

12:45.797 --> 12:48.432

12:48.433 --> 12:51.935
You're darn right...

12:51.936 --> 12:52.936
Well, hi-ho, tim.

12:52.937 --> 12:54.572
Hi, there, wilson.

12:54.573 --> 12:57.007
I haven't seen much of you
in the last couple of weeks.

12:57.008 --> 12:59.477
Well, I've been spending
a lot of time with judith.

12:59.478 --> 13:01.779
As a matter of fact,
I'm sculpting her bust
right now.

13:07.819 --> 13:09.820
So things are going
pretty good, huh?

13:09.821 --> 13:11.422
Oh, they are incredible.

13:11.423 --> 13:14.892
As the japanese would say,
judith has become my <i>aijin.</i>

13:14.893 --> 13:17.495
I don't follow.
Well, as they'd say
in tanzania,

13:17.496 --> 13:20.631
Judith has become
my <i>rafiki yangu mpenzi.</i>

13:21.900 --> 13:25.936
In america, near detroit,
what would they say?

13:25.937 --> 13:28.939
They'd say
I am crazy about her.

13:28.940 --> 13:31.074
You know, tim, I'd love
to stay and chat,

13:31.075 --> 13:32.777
But I have to make
dinner tonight.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.445
I promised judith
something romantic.

13:34.446 --> 13:36.079
Like oysters?
No, I'm making haggis.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.883
It's a sheep's stomach
served dumpling-style.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.252
Mmm.

13:47.392 --> 13:49.927
Hey!
Hi, sweetie.

13:49.928 --> 13:51.462
Great news.

13:51.463 --> 13:55.265
Wilson is making judith's
breasts out of clay.

13:55.266 --> 13:56.600
What?

13:56.601 --> 13:59.603
You were right about them.
He's crazy about her.

13:59.604 --> 14:01.338
Oh, no.

14:01.339 --> 14:06.209
What do you mean, "oh, no"?
This is what you wanted.

14:06.210 --> 14:07.878
I've just been
talking to judith.

14:07.879 --> 14:09.980
She's having serious doubts
about the relationship.

14:09.981 --> 14:12.382
Oh, no.

14:12.383 --> 14:17.455
Judith says that wilson
has a problem with intimacy.

14:17.456 --> 14:18.589
Oh!

14:18.590 --> 14:22.693
So he can't...
Oh. Oh, god. Oh!

14:22.694 --> 14:23.828
Oh!

14:23.829 --> 14:25.996
Well... Oh, honey!

14:25.997 --> 14:28.098
I mean, I would have
never known.

14:28.099 --> 14:30.434
He wouldn't talk about
something like that.

14:30.435 --> 14:32.603
No wonder he's got
all this...

14:32.604 --> 14:34.371
Probably an old war injury
or something, huh?

14:34.372 --> 14:39.076
Not that kind of intimacy!
I'm talking about
emotional intimacy.

14:39.077 --> 14:42.780
Thank god it's nothing
important. Whoo!

14:44.950 --> 14:46.450
He doesn't share
his feelings.

14:46.451 --> 14:48.619
She's spent every day
the last two weeks with him,

14:48.620 --> 14:50.387
And she doesn't know
who he is.

14:50.388 --> 14:53.958
I've spent the last
15 years with him,
and I don't know who he is.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.626
It doesn't hurt
our relationship.

14:55.627 --> 14:58.462
I think she wants something
more from the relationship.

14:58.463 --> 15:00.397
She wants to go
to the next level.

15:00.398 --> 15:04.067
What is it with you women
and the "next level"?

15:04.068 --> 15:06.103
What's wrong with
the level we're on?

15:06.104 --> 15:10.140
Just take the elevator
and leave us
the heck alone. Hmm?

15:10.141 --> 15:11.976
Every time she asks him
about himself,

15:11.977 --> 15:13.811
All he does
is intellectualize

15:13.812 --> 15:15.513
Or say something weird.

15:15.514 --> 15:17.180
He always says
something weird.

15:17.181 --> 15:20.317
That's what makes
wilson wilson wilson.

15:25.123 --> 15:26.991
I think you should
talk to him.
No, I'm not -

15:26.992 --> 15:28.759
You're the only one
that's got a chance
of getting through to him.

15:28.760 --> 15:32.796
I'm supposed to go
talk to that man about
emotions and intimacy?

15:32.797 --> 15:35.032
Granted, you're not
the obvious choice.

15:35.033 --> 15:37.401
But desperate times call
for desperate measures.

15:37.402 --> 15:39.803
If he doesn't
open up to her,
he is gonna lose her.

15:43.642 --> 15:47.945
<i>(grunting)</i> ok, moving
to the next level.

15:47.946 --> 15:49.112
Wilson, you home?

15:49.113 --> 15:51.214
I'm in the kitchen, tim,
making my haggis.

15:51.215 --> 15:52.650
Hey. <i>(sniffs)</i>

15:52.651 --> 15:55.285
You know, that stuff
doesn't smell half-bad.

15:55.286 --> 15:57.287
Pretty excited about having
judith over for dinner?

15:57.288 --> 15:58.622
Oh, yes, indeed.

15:58.623 --> 16:00.591
You really like her?
Oh, yes.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.393
Oh, no. Oh.

16:03.394 --> 16:05.395
Tim, is there something
you want to tell me?

16:05.396 --> 16:08.065
No, there's something
jill wants me to tell you.

16:08.066 --> 16:09.533
Uh...

16:09.534 --> 16:11.569
Judith is having a problem.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.537
What kind of a problem?
Is she all right?

16:13.538 --> 16:15.405
Oh, she's fine.

16:15.406 --> 16:18.909
The problem is with you.

16:18.910 --> 16:21.845
I don't understand.
Things were going so well.

16:21.846 --> 16:24.081
We even made plans to go
to the megalesia festival

16:24.082 --> 16:27.384
To commemorate
the end of the punic war.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.422
She... She says
that - that ...

16:32.423 --> 16:34.458
She told jill that
she doesn't even
think she knows you.

16:34.459 --> 16:36.927
That every time she tries
to get you to open up

16:36.928 --> 16:38.596
You just say something
intellectual.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.699
Oh, my, my, my.
I must be displaying
the symptomatic behavior

16:41.700 --> 16:44.167
Of the classic male
emotional distancer,

16:44.168 --> 16:46.971
Precipitating her
to overfunction
in the relationship,

16:46.972 --> 16:49.773
Therefore causing
deep-seated resentment.

16:49.774 --> 16:52.509
So knock it off.

16:52.510 --> 16:56.313
Tim, I don't take easily
to personal or emotional
revelation.

16:56.314 --> 16:58.115
No guy does.
Opening up emotionally

16:58.116 --> 17:01.685
Is just a horrible thing
women make us do.

17:01.686 --> 17:04.922
Well, tim, I'm just not sure
that I can do that.

17:12.797 --> 17:14.498
Yes, you can.

17:14.499 --> 17:16.266
Just use
the word "feel" more.

17:16.267 --> 17:19.803
You know, like,
"I feel hungry."
"I feel tired."

17:19.804 --> 17:22.940
"I feel big." "I feel small."
"I feel bloated."

17:22.941 --> 17:26.510
Tim, I think that judith
and I weren't meant to be.

17:26.511 --> 17:30.014
To be or not to be,
that is not the question.

17:31.382 --> 17:33.884
You've got to learn
how to open up to this woman,

17:33.885 --> 17:35.753
Otherwise you're gonna be
all by yourself

17:35.754 --> 17:38.055
At that milk of magnesia
festival.

17:42.727 --> 17:45.428
So, are you enjoying
your haggis?

17:45.429 --> 17:48.465
It's very tender.
What's in this?

17:48.466 --> 17:51.601
That is sheep's liver
and other assorted organs.

17:51.602 --> 17:53.570
It's very filling.

17:55.406 --> 17:56.974
These are lovely candles.

17:56.975 --> 17:59.109
Mm.

17:59.110 --> 18:01.444
Well, thank you.

18:01.445 --> 18:04.514
You know, I've always
found it fascinating
how a candle burns.

18:04.515 --> 18:07.551
The hot flame moves downward,
thus melting the wax,

18:07.552 --> 18:10.854
Which rises through the wick
through capillary action...

18:12.557 --> 18:14.457
Oh, boy, that was dull.

18:16.127 --> 18:19.897
Wilson, I think
we should talk.

18:19.898 --> 18:21.732
I know what you're
gonna say, judith.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.533
I haven't been
very open to you.

18:23.534 --> 18:26.770
I don't understand why a man
who can talk brilliantly
about anything

18:26.771 --> 18:29.406
Can't tell me about the one
thing I really want to know.

18:30.942 --> 18:35.045
Well, my family never
really talked much
about personal matters.

18:35.046 --> 18:39.349
Especially my father,
wilson wilson sr.

18:41.319 --> 18:43.687
What was he like?

18:43.688 --> 18:45.589
He was a scientist

18:45.590 --> 18:48.658
Who didn't put too much
stock in emotions.

18:48.659 --> 18:51.428
Must have been very
difficult to grow up
with a man like that.

18:51.429 --> 18:53.630
Mm. It was.

18:53.631 --> 18:56.299
You know,
I loved my father.

18:56.300 --> 19:00.503
It always hurt me when
he kept me at a distance.

19:00.504 --> 19:03.640
And the last thing
I ever wanted was
to be like him.

19:03.641 --> 19:05.375
But you're not.

19:05.376 --> 19:08.045
You believe that
feelings matter.

19:09.580 --> 19:13.150
I know that, because I see
the way you care about mine.

19:18.389 --> 19:21.658
You know, judith...

19:21.659 --> 19:26.897
I've never been
open with a woman
since my wife died.

19:26.898 --> 19:29.666
But I would really like
to try with you.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.769
I'd like that too.

19:36.908 --> 19:38.909
Well, maybe we can
talk about it tomorrow

19:38.910 --> 19:41.111
At the megalesia festival.

19:41.112 --> 19:43.814
If you still want to go.

19:43.815 --> 19:48.418
I wouldn't want to celebrate
the end of the punic war
with anyone else.

19:48.419 --> 19:52.455
Even though I have
absolutely no idea
what the punic war was.

19:52.456 --> 19:54.091
Well, actually,
it's fascinating.

19:54.092 --> 19:56.927
It was when rome
saved itself by...

19:56.928 --> 19:59.629
Oh, who the hell cares?
They'll have beer.

20:04.836 --> 20:08.205
You know, judith,
not to bore you
with more facts...

20:13.444 --> 20:15.112
...But primitive man believed

20:15.113 --> 20:18.481
That the air he breathed
had magic powers.

20:18.482 --> 20:20.750
I'm not bored.

20:20.751 --> 20:25.289
And when a man
and a woman kissed,

20:25.290 --> 20:28.425
It was as if their souls
were mingling.

21:00.691 --> 21:02.192
Oh, look, mark.

21:02.193 --> 21:04.761
It's the sister
we've always wanted.

21:06.130 --> 21:08.765
Hello, bradina.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.767
Laugh all you want.

21:10.768 --> 21:12.402
But I've been going out
with jessica for two weeks,

21:12.403 --> 21:14.938
And she hasn't
noticed one zit.

21:14.939 --> 21:19.276
Yeah, but that doesn't
explain the lipstick
and the mascara.

21:20.879 --> 21:22.880
Well, I dumped out
all mom's makeup.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.714
Which do you think
covers my zits better?

21:24.715 --> 21:27.617
Bashful beige
or nearly nude?

21:28.953 --> 21:31.054
This is too weird.

21:31.055 --> 21:33.323
<i>(doorbell)</i>
I got it!

21:35.226 --> 21:36.860
Hi. Is brad here?

21:36.861 --> 21:39.729
Yeah. He's in the kitchen,
putting on his makeup.

21:46.337 --> 21:48.005
Hey, brad.

21:51.709 --> 21:55.645
Hey, jessica!
What are you doing here?

21:55.646 --> 21:57.314
I, um...

21:57.315 --> 21:59.649
I just thought
maybe we could go
to practice together.

21:59.650 --> 22:01.218
Well, um...

22:01.219 --> 22:05.055
Brad, are you trying
to cover up that zit
on your chin?

22:07.392 --> 22:10.994
Oh, man. I knew I should
have gone with bashful beige.

22:14.498 --> 22:19.937
No. No, I think
that bashful beige
is too dark for you.

22:19.938 --> 22:22.973
You'd look better
in posy pink.

22:22.974 --> 22:25.675
I think I have that.

22:29.513 --> 22:31.014
All right. Now, guys,
you need to remember

22:31.015 --> 22:33.917
To apply it gently
and blend thoroughly,

22:33.918 --> 22:35.452
Because you always want

22:35.453 --> 22:38.388
That natural
boy-next-door look.

22:42.160 --> 22:46.930
There you go. Good job.
