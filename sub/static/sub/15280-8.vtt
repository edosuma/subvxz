WEBVTT

00:13.710 --> 00:15.075
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

00:15.080 --> 00:16.911
Let's go, Jimmy. I'm late already.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.377
Okay, grandma, let's do this.

00:20.830 --> 00:22.821
Yo, boys. Past your bedtime?

00:22.830 --> 00:24.570
I've got places to be, Ray.

00:24.580 --> 00:27.071
You _remember what it's like
beIng young, don't you?

00:27.080 --> 00:28.240
You're kidding, right?

00:28.250 --> 00:29.956
Ray don't remember
what he ate for lunch.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.827
You hear that

00:35.250 --> 00:36.956
Jimmy? Hey.

00:37.830 --> 00:41.379
-Where you been

00:41.380 --> 00:43.166
-Who's your friend

00:43.170 --> 00:45.286
This guy pinched me a few years back.

00:45.290 --> 00:46.325
Right.

00:46.670 --> 00:48.570
You keeping it clean these days?

00:48.580 --> 00:51.413
Oh, yeah.
I'm a nine-to-fiver, minimum wage.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.911
I am rehabilitated.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.321
Yeah, but you'll step out of line again,

00:57.330 --> 01:00.037
and when you do, your ass is mine.

01:05.210 --> 01:06.575
Since when are you friends with cops?

01:06.580 --> 01:08.207
What, we seemed like friends to you?

01:08.210 --> 01:09.529
That's not what I'm saying.

01:09.540 --> 01:14.739
The people that I work for are very
hard-core, and they're all in here.

01:15.330 --> 01:17.161
You don't trust me, Freddy?

01:20.500 --> 01:24.413
-Hey, make up your mind.
-All right, all right. Let's go.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.821
You ever gonna get the heat fixed
in this car or no?

01:37.830 --> 01:39.786
You ever gonna stop bitching?

01:40.290 --> 01:43.418
Why don't you come in? You know
my aunt will set a place for you.

01:43.420 --> 01:46.207
Rain check, Freddy. I'll see you later.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.246
Helen! Do you know what time it is?

02:21.670 --> 02:22.705
Helen?

02:33.250 --> 02:34.490
Oh, my God.

02:36.670 --> 02:38.069
Somebody help.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.708
Somebody help! Somebody help!

02:57.000 --> 02:59.241
I was teaching an in-service
at the Baltimore Field Office

02:59.250 --> 03:00.569
when this came in.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.879
Baltimore PD's seen some grisly stuff,
but never anything like this.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.110
We've got two bodies ID'd
as William and Helen DiMarco.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.202
Retired, lived here for 37 years.
No kids.

03:08.210 --> 03:10.997
Neighbor reports a white male,
20 to 40 years old fleeing the scene.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.377
And I quote,
"Hopped up on those damn drugs."

03:13.380 --> 03:15.826
Eyewitness accounts
are notoriously unreliable.

03:15.830 --> 03:19.459
So far, sounds like a standard
double homicide. Why are we here?

03:27.750 --> 03:29.240
Massive overkill.

03:32.750 --> 03:35.492
Helen DiMarco was found here
tied to the chair in front of the vanity.

03:36.420 --> 03:39.457
_ No defensive wounds. _
LIgature marks around the wrists.

03:39.460 --> 03:41.746
One clean laceration from ear to ear.

03:41.750 --> 03:44.913
Looks arterial. Probably the carotid.
She went quickly.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.161
The husband William
was found in the shower,

03:47.170 --> 03:49.070
but he wasn't quite as luclq.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.741
Ligature marks
on the wrists and ankles

03:50.750 --> 03:52.957
and one long laceration
up the abdomen

03:52.960 --> 03:54.325
through both layers of muscle.

03:54.330 --> 03:57.288
Evisceration? That's typical
of disorganized behavior.

03:57.290 --> 04:01.909
Despite all the blood, this crime scene
shows method, order, control.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.035
I'd say it's pretty organized.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.281
There was also evidence of torture
with the husband.

04:06.290 --> 04:10.283
Burns, contusions, lacerations.
You name it, this guy tried it.

04:10.290 --> 04:13.327
If torture is the UnSub's signature,
the methodology's usually unique.

04:13.330 --> 04:16.458
A person who burns someone
doesn't normally use a knife.

04:16.460 --> 04:17.950
So maybe we have
more than one killer,

04:17.960 --> 04:20.110
_ or we have one killer _
With more than one personality.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.031
We also have three victims.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.201
Blood on the vanity,
wife's body was found there.

04:24.210 --> 04:26.201
The husband was in the shower.

04:26.580 --> 04:29.458
From the looks of the level
of the ring in this tub,

04:29.460 --> 04:32.167
whoever was in it
lost their entire blood volume.

04:32.170 --> 04:33.956
Approximately 10.6 pints.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.110
Which means
the victim was dismembered.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.032
It looks like our guy
took all the parts with him.

05:15.040 --> 05:19.249
Hemingway wrote, "There is
no hunting like the hunting of man,

05:19.830 --> 05:23.743
"and those who have hunted
armed men long enough and liked it

05:24.380 --> 05:26.450
"never really care for anything else."

05:26.460 --> 05:30.282
Possible suspect is a white male,
20 to 40 years old.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.611
He is considered armed
and very dangerous.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.030
Okay, what do we know
about the UnSub

05:34.040 --> 05:35.610
based on the two bodies we do have?

05:35.620 --> 05:39.033
Typically, torture falls into two
categories, sadistic and functional.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.782
Functional torture is used _
to extract Information or to punish.

05:41.790 --> 05:44.111
It's measured, impersonal,
completely disinterested.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.667
-Like a military tactic.
-Exactly.

05:45.670 --> 05:46.819
Then there's sadistic torture

05:46.830 --> 05:49.993
which is used
to extract some sort of emotional need.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.243
But sadists are sexually deviant, yet
there's no evidence of sexual contact.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.616
-That we know of.
-What do you mean?

05:56.620 --> 05:59.032
Well, we don't have the third body yet.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.532
Okay, so I've got Helen DiMarco
tied to the chair.

06:08.420 --> 06:09.705
He probably killed her first.

06:09.710 --> 06:12.372
Prove to the others
that he had no mercy.

06:12.380 --> 06:15.110
Psychological torture
before the physical pain.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.070
Only there was no satisfaction
from her death.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.662
It was too brief. It was over too quickly.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.035
And the husband?

06:32.460 --> 06:34.246
With him he took his time.

06:36.420 --> 06:37.956
There doesn't seem to be
any wasted effort.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.746
No hesitation on the UnSub's part.

06:39.750 --> 06:43.572
I mean, Gideon, look around.
What he did was a lot of work.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.610
We're either dealing
with a professional or...

06:46.620 --> 06:48.030
A pure psychopath.

06:52.620 --> 06:56.078
Hey, it's me.
I got trouble, man. Serious trouble.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.207
Don't tell me to relax, damn it!

06:58.210 --> 07:00.701
I ran into a detective I know last night.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.572
00.

07:16.710 --> 07:20.419
Nothing more we can do here
until the third victim turns up.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.957
I'm guessing
there's a connection to him.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.372
He doesn't want that victim identified.

07:29.170 --> 07:31.320
Have Garcia
go through open files in Maryland.

07:31.330 --> 07:33.457
See if any of them involve
this level of torture.

07:33.460 --> 07:34.609
Got it.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.373
Have her check the surrounding states,
as well.

07:37.620 --> 07:40.373
If guy's a pro,
why do jobs only close to home?

07:40.880 --> 07:43.952
-How far back you want her to go?
-At least 10 years.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.325
Guy's no rookie.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.742
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

08:22.460 --> 08:25.532
Third victim was positively ID'd
as a low-level Mob guy,

08:25.540 --> 08:27.326
Frederick "Freddy" Condore.

08:27.330 --> 08:29.321
He was the nephew of the older couple.

08:29.330 --> 08:31.457
Body parts were found
in seven different trash cans

08:31.460 --> 08:32.916
two blocks from the crime scene.

08:32.920 --> 08:35.320
Were they able to completely
reassemble the body?

08:35.330 --> 08:36.786
The killer didn't keep any trophies.

08:36.790 --> 08:38.417
Is there any evidence
that he got off?

08:38.420 --> 08:39.569
No.

08:39.580 --> 08:41.662
Garcia has a number of
unsolved murders

08:41.670 --> 08:44.912
in D.C., Virginia, and Maryland
over the past 15 years.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.616
Many of them have ties
to organized crime.

08:47.620 --> 08:48.917
All different MOs.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.036
-What's the connection?
-Torture.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.747
Marks on the bones are consistent
with the same cutting tool.

08:54.750 --> 08:58.038
Tortured victims,
most tied to organized crime,

08:59.290 --> 09:01.417
no signs of sexual sadism.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.166
We're looking for a hit man.

09:03.170 --> 09:06.037
No, a hit man doesn't need to torture
to get the job done.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.166
Two things.

09:07.170 --> 09:09.821
Baltimore just fonNarded a sketch
of the man running from the scene.

09:09.830 --> 09:11.286
And you've got some agents out there

09:11.290 --> 09:13.497
who think
that you're poaching on their turf.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.785
I'll handle it.

09:21.830 --> 09:23.240
SSA Hotchner.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.913
Josh Cramer. Special Agent in charge
of organized Crime Baltimore.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.241
-SSA Gideon.
-Jason Gideon.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.115
The BAU's pretty famous.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.452
-You brought the whole team, huh?
-Yeah, we were in town.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.496
We were just going over the case.
Do you want to join us?

09:35.500 --> 09:36.876
I'd love to but I can't stay.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.165
I just wanted to come down and say

09:38.170 --> 09:40.786
thank you for going to Baltimore
yesterday, looking into this for us,

09:40.790 --> 09:43.418
but now that it's pretty obviously
an Organized Crime case,

09:43.420 --> 09:45.877
we're going to go ahead
and take over for you.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.326
I'm sure you guys have enough to do
with your psychos.

09:48.330 --> 09:51.413
You don't think that the guy
who killed the DiMarcos is a psycho?

09:51.420 --> 09:55.413
Well, what he is now is my problem.
But again, thanks for coming out.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.660
Anything we can do to help.

09:56.670 --> 09:58.206
Appreciate that.
We're pretty good at this.

09:58.210 --> 09:59.370
-You got it.
-All right.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.371
You know where we live.
-Okay.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.240
So, we're just going to drop it?

10:10.830 --> 10:12.411
These guys don't know
what they're dealing with.

10:12.420 --> 10:17.665
Our UnSub is male, intelligent,
organized, and methodical.

10:17.670 --> 10:20.412
He has the confidence of a man
who's been killing for a long time.

10:22.380 --> 10:25.611
The only victim removed
from the scene is Freddy Condore,

10:25.620 --> 10:27.781
indicating some tie to him.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.708
Elle, you and Reid stay on
Condore's background with Garcia,

10:30.710 --> 10:32.280
dig deep, see what turns up.

10:32.290 --> 10:35.077
Condore worked as a supervisor
at a scrap metal yard in Baltimore.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.412
It's owned by a guy
named Michael Russo,

10:37.420 --> 10:39.206
boss of a small Mob crew.

10:39.210 --> 10:41.872
I'm going to grab Hotch
and go check him out.

10:48.330 --> 10:49.570
Michael Russo?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.161
Agents Hotchner and Morgan, FBI.

10:54.710 --> 10:56.871
-What do you want?
-Freddy Condore.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.577
He didn't show up for work today.
Didn't call. Nothing.

11:00.580 --> 11:04.414
Probably because he and his aunt
and uncle were murdered last night.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.115
Really?

11:07.880 --> 11:09.609
Yeah?

11:09.620 --> 11:11.576
I can tell you're all busted up about it.

11:11.580 --> 11:14.287
Look, I don't speak smartass,
so if you got something to say to me...

11:14.290 --> 11:15.496
It was a professional hit.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.116
Either you're in charge
of your business or you're not.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.701
What kind of business
do you think I'm in, huh?

11:19.710 --> 11:21.746
Look around, I'm in scrap metal.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.287
It's all about recycling.
That's where the money is, my friend.

11:24.290 --> 11:25.826
Saving the Earth.

11:25.830 --> 11:27.491
You've got a big problem.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.071
You know the Mob isn't
what it used to be.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.747
Ain't easy always fighting for respect,
is it?

11:36.750 --> 11:38.786
You always gotta ﬁght for what's yours.

11:38.790 --> 11:41.782
One of your boys steps out of line,
you hit him hard.

11:41.790 --> 11:45.112
You make it count, right

11:47.170 --> 11:51.209
Look, you've got a case to make,
run along, get your papers.

11:51.210 --> 11:55.749
Come back with the bracelets.
Otherwise, I got a business to run.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.871
You're breathing on my neck.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.457
I'm sorry. Sorry for that.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.166
You two having fun?

12:13.170 --> 12:16.071
Oh, yeah, sifting through
the life and times of Freddy Condore

12:16.080 --> 12:19.379
with Doctor Reid here is a party
I wouldn't want to miss.

12:19.380 --> 12:23.453
Credit card receipts show Freddy loved
crab cakes, preferred lite beer

12:23.460 --> 12:27.282
and used to spend his Thursday nights
with a woman in Fells Point.

12:27.290 --> 12:30.032
An expensive woman.

12:31.790 --> 12:33.109
What about his associates?

12:33.120 --> 12:36.248
-Most of them have criminal records.
-That much I guessed.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.956
_ But one of them _
is particularly interesting.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.030
Pull up James Baker's rap sheet.

12:41.290 --> 12:43.827
He spent time in juvenile detention
for attempted murder,

12:43.830 --> 12:45.878
was released at age 21.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.610
And then subsequently arrested for,
and this is in order,

12:48.620 --> 12:54.536
armed robbery, petty theft,
burglary, narcotics sales and rape.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.417
But there's no_other _ _
sexual assault complaints in his file.

12:57.420 --> 13:00.321
Absolutely nothing.
I told you it was interesting.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.667
What's so interesting about that?

13:02.670 --> 13:05.116
When it comes to psychological
behavior, anything is possible.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.078
But this criminal history
just isn't probable.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.787
I mean, as a minor,
he began with attempted murder

13:10.790 --> 13:13.418
and then devolved into pettier crimes?

13:13.420 --> 13:15.456
It's the criminal history
of a fractured schizophrenic

13:15.460 --> 13:17.246
with multiple personality disorder.

13:17.250 --> 13:18.615
It just does not make sense.

13:18.620 --> 13:21.077
Unless someone
made that rap sheet up.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.490
And they weren't thinking
about the behavior,

13:22.500 --> 13:25.071
they just plugged in
whatever sounded good.

13:25.460 --> 13:27.610
Hold on. His mug shot's coming up.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.075
I've got an address for you to hit.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.416
Clear.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.206
Copy that.

13:45.460 --> 13:46.825
It's clear here.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.247
Morgan, this is weird.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.072
There's nothing here.
It's like nobody lives here.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.161
Guess he wasn't expecting company.

14:00.170 --> 14:02.320
-Something's wrong.
-Yeah, I know.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.490
Look at this place.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.570
It's an artificial dwelling

14:08.790 --> 14:10.701
to match an artificial past.

14:25.540 --> 14:26.780
Come on, Josh.

14:45.670 --> 14:46.785
-Hotch.
-Yeah?

14:46.790 --> 14:48.667
We got a hot weapon.

14:54.580 --> 14:55.786
Oh, no.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.076
It's a GLOCK 19.

15:01.670 --> 15:05.071
And this round
is standard law enforcement issue.

15:07.380 --> 15:09.951
So you're saying
Baker's an undercover cop?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.166
I'm saying I did 18 months deep cover,

15:12.170 --> 15:15.321
and this place,
it's got all the makings of a crash pad.

15:23.420 --> 15:25.035
All right, where is he?

15:25.330 --> 15:27.457
No. No, he is not here.

15:28.250 --> 15:29.535
Baker's missing.

15:29.540 --> 15:32.919
00. Damn it, damn it.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.411
Jimmy, where the hell are you?
Hey, hey, come on, let's go.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.661
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

15:43.670 --> 15:46.161
-Sorry?
-I told you, this is my case.

15:46.170 --> 15:47.785
All right. First of all,
don't shout at me.

15:47.790 --> 15:50.611
And secondly, you don't decide
what cases the BAU works on.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.668
You ran my agent's gun through IBIS.

15:52.670 --> 15:54.240
Because I wanted to know
who he worked for,

15:54.250 --> 15:56.878
and now that I do,
I'd like to talk to him.

15:57.170 --> 15:59.161
-You don't have him?
-No.

15:59.170 --> 16:00.990
You don't know where he is?

16:03.750 --> 16:05.615
-He's missing.
-How long?

16:05.620 --> 16:08.498
-About 12 hours.
-Before or after the murders?

16:11.290 --> 16:13.372
You think Jimmy's a suspect?

16:13.380 --> 16:14.529
Well, there's a sketch of someone

16:14.540 --> 16:16.371
who looks _an awful lot like him
leaVIng the scene.

16:16.380 --> 16:18.951
That's because he was there. After.

16:19.670 --> 16:21.706
Look, he ran into
a couple of Baltimore detectives

16:21.710 --> 16:24.031
and they made him
while he was with Condore.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.166
Now, Jimmy tried to play it off,

16:25.170 --> 16:26.660
but he didn't think
that Condore had bought it,

16:26.670 --> 16:28.956
so he wanted to go back
and talk to him.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.780
When he saw
what was left of the DiMarcos,

16:30.790 --> 16:34.032
he called us for a pickup.
We showed up, he didn't.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.490
You think he ran?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.491
No, Jimmy's too experienced
to run without contact.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.615
If he's not calling in,

16:39.620 --> 16:41.872
then someone's keeping him
from doing it.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.496
-Who's Jimmy Baker's target?
-Michael Russo.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.706
We've been after the guy
for three years.

16:47.710 --> 16:50.531
-Jimmy's been under for almost two.
-We talked to Russo yesterday.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.667
He seemed genuinely surprised
by the murders.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.035
And you bought that?

16:54.040 --> 16:55.951
Let me tell you a little something
about Michael Russo.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.497
The guy is a liar, and a good one.

16:58.790 --> 17:01.111
If he didn't do it, he knows who did.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.281
Oh, hell. You know what?
I'm wasting my time with you.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.030
You obviously don't get it.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.201
Agent Cramer, we're not the enemy.

17:11.210 --> 17:12.575
Please sit down.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.821
We're dealing with
a very dangerous killer here.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.416
We need your help.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.162
You know these people
better than we do.

17:35.170 --> 17:36.205
This guy?

17:37.920 --> 17:40.571
If he is what you say he is
and he has Jimmy,

17:41.830 --> 17:43.320
did he kill him already?

17:43.330 --> 17:44.615
We don't know.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.741
I'll help you in any way that I can.

17:54.790 --> 17:57.418
You help me get this man
back to his family.

17:59.790 --> 18:01.576
Who knows about me, Jimmy?

18:02.380 --> 18:04.075
What did you tell them?

18:04.920 --> 18:05.955
Nothing.

18:09.210 --> 18:11.781
Nothing. I promise. Nothing.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.110
I think you're a liar and a rat.

18:15.620 --> 18:16.746
Oh, please.

18:23.830 --> 18:26.071
We're going to need a bigger board.

18:28.380 --> 18:30.280
Please tell me
you brought some breakfast.

18:30.290 --> 18:31.496
Trust me, sugar,

18:31.500 --> 18:34.992
you are not going to want to eat
when you see what's in here.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.115
How many more are there?

18:41.120 --> 18:44.248
Well, I've gone back 15 years,
and there's over 100.

18:44.620 --> 18:45.871
A hundred unsolved murders?

18:45.880 --> 18:49.031
Yeah, that we know of.
And then there's more coming in.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.036
Well, the torture's consistent.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.241
You know, we thought this guy
might have been at it a while,

18:58.250 --> 19:00.115
but this many victims, Garcia?

19:00.120 --> 19:02.668
John Wayne Gacy killed
at least 30 people.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.496
This guy's more than tripled that.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.412
Yeah, but this guy gets paid for it.
He's a hit man.

19:07.420 --> 19:08.455
No.

19:12.170 --> 19:13.706
He's more than that.

19:14.710 --> 19:16.029
Not all these victims were Mob hits.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.701
You know, my guess is
he probably started hunting

19:17.710 --> 19:19.450
when he was really young.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.992
Perfected his craft.
Moved on to bigger prey.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.416
Garcia, look at this.

19:27.420 --> 19:29.706
There's no hesitation wounds
on the body.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.952
-One clean cut through flesh and bone.
-Yes. Okay, so what does that tell us?

19:32.960 --> 19:34.075
Most people wouldn't imagine

19:34.080 --> 19:35.707
doing something like this
to another human being.

19:35.710 --> 19:38.031
But this guy, he doesn't even flinch.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.206
He's got no conscience.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.453
We've got ourselves a serial killer
with a perfect career.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.996
Russo has no idea
what he's dealing with.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.412
I think we can shake him.
Keep looking.

20:11.290 --> 20:14.828
-How can I help you agents?
-We're worried about you.

20:17.170 --> 20:19.240
What's causing you to lose sleep?

20:19.250 --> 20:21.878
We hear you didn't order that hit
on Freddy.

20:22.290 --> 20:24.781
I told you I had nothing to do with that.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.281
Why don't you take a look
in that folder?

20:33.170 --> 20:35.821
It looks like you must have
a problem within your organization.

20:35.830 --> 20:36.990
Is that right?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.706
See, your hitter
doesn't just kill for a paycheck.

20:38.710 --> 20:40.200
He kills for pleasure.

20:40.210 --> 20:42.110
It's what makes him good
at what he does.

20:42.120 --> 20:45.328
He's paranoid. He's a psychopath.
And he's freelancing.

20:45.960 --> 20:49.703
He's killing civilians now
and he's drawing a lot of attention.

20:49.710 --> 20:51.496
And you can't control him.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.377
That's what he did
to Freddy's uncle.

20:54.380 --> 20:57.531
Russo, if he's not a problem
for you now, he will be.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.417
Why don't you let me worry about that?

21:12.330 --> 21:15.242
Russo, just got a question for you.

21:18.750 --> 21:21.036
How do you think your paranoid little
killer's going to feel

21:21.040 --> 21:23.417
about you being friendly with the FBI?

21:27.500 --> 21:29.036
Just a thought.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.616
Is he being serious?

21:34.790 --> 21:35.950
Success.

21:36.460 --> 21:39.372
Hotch and Morgan just shook
Russo's confidence in his hit man.

21:39.380 --> 21:40.529
Well, he'll want to bring him in

21:40.540 --> 21:41.746
-and get a read on him.
-Yes, ma'am.

21:41.750 --> 21:43.069
What if by playing them
against each other,

21:43.080 --> 21:44.957
we've_ made_Russo
as paran0id as his hit man?

21:44.960 --> 21:46.825
What would stop them
from trying to kill each other?

21:46.830 --> 21:49.242
Well, if that happens, then we'll never
find Jimmy Baker alive.

21:49.250 --> 21:53.072
We've got a surveillance team outside
of Russo's office. Stay on it.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.036
Is this going to work?

22:13.040 --> 22:14.996
The beam is reflected
from the windowpane

22:15.000 --> 22:16.456
according to the law of optics.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.247
Yeah, the angle of incidence is equal
to the angle of reflection.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.411
Is it going to work?

22:21.420 --> 22:24.162
Hey, it's me.
I need to see you tonight.

22:24.170 --> 22:26.161
I'll call you from a secure line.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.410
Apparently.

22:37.830 --> 22:38.876
Hey.

22:39.540 --> 22:42.953
Listen, you brought a lot of heat
taking down Freddy like that.

22:42.960 --> 22:47.078
I'm dealing with the Feds.
Listen, meet me here at the office.

22:47.710 --> 22:50.747
They don't know nothing.
I'm dealing with them.

22:51.330 --> 22:54.458
-Stop being paranoid, Vinnie.
-Bingo.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.870
No. Vinnie.

23:01.830 --> 23:03.457
It's pretty remarkable, really.

23:03.460 --> 23:08.659
Nature's got her own cleanup crew.
Flies, larvae, maggots, beetles.

23:08.670 --> 23:13.573
Then there's the big guys, of course.
Rats, squirrels, crows, buzzards.

23:13.580 --> 23:17.789
I learned a long time ago
never to kill anybody above 5000 feet.

23:17.790 --> 23:21.282
It's cold up there.
The evidence tends to linger.

23:25.790 --> 23:28.873
They'll be along soon.
They like the scent of blood.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.496
Please.

23:37.670 --> 23:40.457
Russo's got 11 associates
named Vincent.

23:40.460 --> 23:41.575
Oh, make that ten.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.957
Vincent Cellito died last summer.

23:44.580 --> 23:45.956
Here's something.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.071
What can you tell me
about Vincent Sartori?

23:52.460 --> 23:53.609
I was still drinking that.

23:53.620 --> 23:57.329
Not only is this equipment expensive,
it's also extremely sensitive.

23:57.330 --> 23:59.070
Vincent Sartori.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.287
Currently doing six at Dannemora
for racketeering.

24:01.290 --> 24:03.531
How about this Perotta?
There's not much on him.

24:03.540 --> 24:05.280
Can you get into those records?

24:05.290 --> 24:07.781
Despite the fact
that they were probably expunged,

24:07.790 --> 24:09.451
she can find
the faintest echo of deletion,

24:09.460 --> 24:10.700
successfully recreate the file,

24:10.710 --> 24:14.453
thereby sending us all to prison
for computer felony fraud counts.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.787
-We can make bail. Garcia?
-Already in.

24:17.790 --> 24:22.568
Alcohol addiction at 14.
Violent outbursts. Assaults.

24:23.210 --> 24:26.418
Once threw a_ Molotov co_cktail
at someone Sitting in their car.

24:26.420 --> 24:27.990
Several notations for aggression.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.616
He once scheduled a visit
to an infirmary

24:30.620 --> 24:34.499
to gain access to a boy
who looked at him for too long.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.708
No fear, no remorse, quick temper.

24:37.710 --> 24:41.032
And he was smart enough
to stay off the radar as an adult.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.110
Paranoid personality.
Could be our guy.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.247
There's absolutely no information
on him as an adult.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.707
Like no driver's license,
no utility bills, nothing.

24:47.710 --> 24:51.453
-It's like he became a ghost.
-Let's just hope they can catch him.

25:01.380 --> 25:04.201
Remember, we need this man alive.

25:04.210 --> 25:05.279
Copy that.

25:13.380 --> 25:14.665
It's all clear.

25:21.670 --> 25:22.819
Nothing.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.115
Hotch?

25:49.790 --> 25:51.496
Hotch, let me take him.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.661
Don't take it.
We need him alive.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.035
You okay?

26:19.830 --> 26:22.492
Take your tie off
for once in your life, huh?

26:23.080 --> 26:24.377
It's all right.

26:36.750 --> 26:40.208
There's a van around the corner.
Looks like blood all over it.

26:40.210 --> 26:42.201
It's being processed right now.

26:42.210 --> 26:44.826
Whatever they find
they're going to send over to Quantico.

26:44.830 --> 26:46.570
They got Jimmy's jacket.

26:56.210 --> 26:57.325
Take off.

27:17.620 --> 27:21.738
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

27:42.920 --> 27:45.491
We don't have time for this little show.

27:45.500 --> 27:48.617
Interrogation techniques say make the
guy comfortable, make him your friend,

27:48.620 --> 27:50.451
give him a way out.
That's how you get a confession.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.997
That may work with a common criminal.
It's not going to work here.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.160
Why is that?

27:54.170 --> 27:56.320
Beca_use anti-social
personality disorder means

27:56.330 --> 27:59.072
never trust anyone
with anything at any time.

28:01.500 --> 28:04.992
-Then what are you supposed to do?
-Make him uncomfortable.

28:15.710 --> 28:19.578
-This was all in his van?
-Yeah, the guy wasn't exactly neat.

28:19.580 --> 28:21.787
Classic anti-social personality.

28:21.790 --> 28:23.997
-What are these tapes?
-I don't know.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.491
Why don't you and Garcia
go take a look

28:26.500 --> 28:28.821
Yeah, movie night. I'll make popcorn.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.497
-Go home.
-I'm fine. He's got a little slack.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.116
Morgan says he's secure, he's secure.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.576
-Jason.
-Yeah.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.491
Let's not give him a weapon.

28:41.750 --> 28:43.206
He's kind of strong.

28:43.210 --> 28:44.370
-Hey, Hotch

28:44.380 --> 28:46.075
-I'll be okay.
-All right.

28:56.790 --> 28:59.372
I'm Supervisory Special Agent
Jason Gideon.

28:59.380 --> 29:02.747
-Federal Bureau of Investigation.
-You afraid of me, Jason?

29:03.920 --> 29:05.990
You were advised of your rights?

29:08.540 --> 29:10.872
Take these off and we'll really talk.

29:11.330 --> 29:13.412
Were you advised of your rights?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.787
-I know my rights.
-You want to talk?

29:17.330 --> 29:20.208
-I got nothing to hide.
-Good.

29:29.290 --> 29:31.872
How's it going?
-Don't turn your back on him, Gideon.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.529
Hotch, you know how he is.

29:33.540 --> 29:35.451
He's just trying to show him
that he's not intimidated.

29:35.460 --> 29:38.668
Yeah, it's not about fear,
it's about being dismissive.

29:38.670 --> 29:41.207
Perotta could assume
that he's disrespecting him.

29:41.210 --> 29:44.748
Why don't we turn these cameras off?
I'll get him to tell us where Jimmy is.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.878
-That wouldn't work.
-You sure about that?

29:47.880 --> 29:50.246
Yeah, he was probably abused
by one or both of his parents.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.660
He's learned to take the pain.

29:51.670 --> 29:53.706
And that's why he has no compassion
for anyone else's.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.666
You've got to trust us.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.748
-You're not organized Crime.
-No.

30:00.750 --> 30:04.072
-We're Behavioral Analysis.
-What's that mean?

30:05.880 --> 30:08.952
Well, we study how you think,
why you do what you do.

30:10.540 --> 30:12.747
-No kidding?
-We have a word for you.

30:12.750 --> 30:16.242
-You've got a word for me?
-Oh, yeah, actually we have a few.

30:17.330 --> 30:21.039
Psychopath.
Paranoid personality disorder.

30:22.210 --> 30:24.246
That's quite a mouthful, Jason.

30:24.790 --> 30:25.916
Yes, it is.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.075
Michael Russo set me up, didn't he?

30:36.250 --> 30:38.036
Do you recognize this man?

30:39.460 --> 30:40.495
Nope.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.497
How about them

30:45.880 --> 30:48.030
Wait a minute. The third guy over.

30:48.620 --> 30:52.249
I think he does those late-night
commercials for the dead worms.

30:54.170 --> 30:55.614
You know, softies.

30:57.210 --> 30:58.370
That's funny to you?

30:58.380 --> 31:01.247
It's just interesting
that you'd choose that expression.

31:01.250 --> 31:03.206
You have problems performing?

31:03.960 --> 31:04.995
Not me.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.378
Where's he going with this? There's
no evidence this guy can't perform.

31:09.380 --> 31:12.668
I know Gideon knows that.
He's just pushing his buttons.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.496
Does murder excite you?

31:18.330 --> 31:21.663
Is that the only thing
that can give you a sexual release?

31:31.580 --> 31:32.706
Vincent,

31:38.420 --> 31:41.036
I believe you are
an extremely impotent man.

31:41.710 --> 31:43.666
Take these off and we'll see.

31:44.420 --> 31:45.990
Cramer!

31:46.000 --> 31:47.319
He's a federal agent!

31:47.330 --> 31:48.991
-I will personally execute you!
-Get out of here!

31:49.000 --> 31:50.160
Personally!

32:00.670 --> 32:03.036
Baker is a federal agent. I knew it.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.569
Where is he, Vincent?

32:06.580 --> 32:10.323
Hey, Jason! Is it still called "paranoid"
if I'm right?

32:23.710 --> 32:26.952
Ten bucks says this involves
naked coeds and a plumber.

32:27.670 --> 32:29.956
-What?
-Never mind.

32:35.210 --> 32:37.826
-Okay, who is that?
-I have no idea.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.286
Put another tape in.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.240
Oh, my God.

32:51.380 --> 32:52.608
I'll be back.

32:57.210 --> 32:59.610
What the hell is wrong with you?

33:01.120 --> 33:02.997
My friend might still be alive
out there somewhere.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.820
You just told him
Baker was a federal agent.

33:04.830 --> 33:06.570
He may never tell us now.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.030
-I told him to hang tough.
-What?

33:11.000 --> 33:14.242
Jimmy. When he called me,
I told him to stick with the assignment,

33:14.250 --> 33:16.992
that we didn't need
to bring him in right away.

33:17.540 --> 33:20.748
Hey, I had too much invested, all right?
Too much time.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.240
And I wanted Russo.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.701
So we waited 24 hours to go in for him.

33:24.710 --> 33:26.029
By the time we got there, that maniac...

33:26.040 --> 33:28.747
There's a chance
Agent Baker's being tortured.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.456
And I think I know how.

33:34.540 --> 33:35.666
After you.

33:55.420 --> 33:56.876
Oh, my God!

33:59.920 --> 34:01.820
Oh, please no!

34:03.710 --> 34:06.668
Oh, God! Oh, God!

34:07.880 --> 34:10.531
No!

34:16.500 --> 34:17.615
-You needed me?
-Yeah.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.612
These are the faces of new victims
off the videotapes we found.

34:20.620 --> 34:22.702
Check with local,
see if they have any open homicides

34:22.710 --> 34:25.076
or missings that might correspond.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.911
-Are those rats?
-Yeah.

34:29.210 --> 34:30.370
What are we going to do?

34:30.380 --> 34:32.280
Well, we looked at all the stuff
from the van.

34:32.290 --> 34:34.667
And besides the videotapes,
there's nothing that interesting.

34:34.670 --> 34:36.240
I've got Garcia going over
the sound on the tapes,

34:36.250 --> 34:37.990
trying to isolate the background noise.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.206
Maybe something there will help.

34:39.210 --> 34:42.031
The good news is it seems like they
were all filmed in the same space.

34:42.040 --> 34:43.610
It could be some sort of home base
for him.

34:43.620 --> 34:45.247
Yeah, but where is it?

34:46.080 --> 34:48.412
What do we know
about Vincent Perotta?

34:49.880 --> 34:51.324
He's off the grid.

34:51.330 --> 34:52.740
Garcia can't find a registered phone,

34:52.750 --> 34:54.615
utility bill or home address
on this hump.

34:54.620 --> 34:55.826
Come on, everybody lives somewhere.

34:55.830 --> 34:57.070
There's got to be a paper trail.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.377
If there is, we can't find it.

34:58.380 --> 35:01.201
In this day and age you can't live
without leaving some sort of trace.

35:01.210 --> 35:03.166
Unless someone
pays your bills for you.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.535
What about Russo?

35:04.540 --> 35:06.417
-Could he be taking care of him?
-No. No, no, no.

35:06.420 --> 35:09.162
Russo's not paying anybody's bills
but his own.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.161
Well, he has to have a weakness.

35:13.420 --> 35:16.116
It's in his crime. It's in his behavior.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.667
You know,
something's just been bugging me.

35:19.670 --> 35:22.537
Freddy. Wasn't he easy to find?

35:22.540 --> 35:25.748
He cut up the body,
he removed it from the crime scene.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.456
But then he leaves it
a couple of blocks away,

35:27.460 --> 35:29.246
where he's got to know
we're going to find it.

35:29.250 --> 35:31.821
It's the whole reason we were able
to connect Perotta to the crime.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.570
-He made a mistake.
-Yeah, he did.

35:33.580 --> 35:36.743
-He went off script.
-What does that mean?

35:36.750 --> 35:38.786
That something
knocked him off his game.

35:38.790 --> 35:41.247
-That's right.
-His behavior.

35:43.210 --> 35:45.246
-Well, what does he do?
-He tortures.

35:45.250 --> 35:47.992
-Always?
-The difference is Mrs. DiMarco.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.615
Right.

35:50.460 --> 35:52.496
-You want to finish this?
-Yeah.

35:53.790 --> 35:55.030
Keep working.

35:57.670 --> 36:00.878
Hey, look who's here. My old friend.
Feeling better?

36:03.120 --> 36:04.371
Where's Jason?

36:11.330 --> 36:15.448
You grew up in a house that looked
normal and happy, didn't you, Vincent?

36:15.460 --> 36:16.575
Did I?

36:16.580 --> 36:19.208
But your father beat you
every chance he got.

36:19.210 --> 36:22.202
He smacked me around some.
Didn't everybody's old man?

36:22.210 --> 36:23.279
No.

36:24.170 --> 36:27.378
Well maybe if yours had,
you would have learned to fight.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.786
There. Do you hear that?

36:33.330 --> 36:35.241
-What is that?
-I don't know.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.075
It's like it's moving.

36:39.420 --> 36:40.705
Getting closer.

36:43.170 --> 36:44.285
Airplane.

36:46.290 --> 36:48.918
Paranoid personalities
develop in childhood.

36:49.880 --> 36:53.418
You know you're saving me
thousands of dollars in therapy bills?

36:53.420 --> 36:55.490
And you learned to take the beatings,
the abuse.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.070
You learned to smile.

36:57.540 --> 37:01.954
But in the back of your mind
you probably thought, "One day...

37:03.960 --> 37:06.451
"One day, when I'm big enough..."

37:06.460 --> 37:09.532
So you were bullied and abused,
and you became an abuser and a bully.

37:09.540 --> 37:11.076
It's a logical progression.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.377
-Rea|ly?
-Yeah.

37:13.420 --> 37:16.071
Your father beat your mother, too,
didn't he?

37:18.040 --> 37:20.531
My mother's got nothing to do with this.

37:25.750 --> 37:28.162
Elle, who eats this much food
in their car?

37:28.170 --> 37:31.958
Anyone who spends hours and hours
in it waiting. Hunting.

37:34.330 --> 37:35.911
-Look.
-Weird.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.913
This is crazy. There's not one address,
no paperwork, no registration.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.205
It's all garbage.

37:41.210 --> 37:44.577
Pizza boxes,
nasty looking Chinese food,

37:44.580 --> 37:46.571
and hamburger joints.

37:46.580 --> 37:49.492
-Wait. Pizza.
-What about it?

37:49.500 --> 37:52.458
Who.
Where do you order your pizza from?

37:53.250 --> 37:55.115
I get my pizza
from my own neighborhood.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.166
Franetti's.

38:01.620 --> 38:03.030
Your mother knew.

38:03.620 --> 38:07.454
She knew that he beat you every day
and she did nothing to help you.

38:09.460 --> 38:11.872
And you still loved her.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.610
Even though she let you get hurt,
you loved her.

38:14.620 --> 38:17.919
And I wondered why,
why you didn't hate her.

38:19.540 --> 38:23.328
Then, of course, I realized that
he beat her as much as he beat you.

38:24.580 --> 38:26.411
Don't talk about my mother.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.111
You killed all these people.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.327
Hundreds of them,
and only one woman.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.610
That's what made you get sloppy,
isn't it?

38:37.620 --> 38:39.326
Killing Mrs. DiMarco was hard.

38:39.330 --> 38:42.242
That's why you did it first
and you made it quick.

38:43.540 --> 38:45.826
I thought it was to establish dominance
but it wasn't.

38:45.830 --> 38:47.912
-He was a bastard, all right

38:47.920 --> 38:49.990
I call him Frank.
He was a mean son of a bitch.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.991
Is that what you want to know?

38:59.540 --> 39:01.917
Gideon, I think we got something here.

39:02.500 --> 39:05.663
He's got a bunch of pizza boxes
from Franetti's Pizza.

39:05.670 --> 39:08.412
It's in Glen Burnie, a suburb
that backs up right to the airport.

39:08.420 --> 39:09.569
Which makes sense

39:09.580 --> 39:11.787
since we can hear airplanes
in the background of the video.

39:11.790 --> 39:13.496
Check property records
for Frank Perotta.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.115
-Who?
-His father.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.328
-Why?
-He still lives in his father's house.

39:18.330 --> 39:21.822
I'll get Garcia on it.
-That's why nothing is in his name.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.075
You got that address?

39:25.080 --> 39:26.877
-It's in Glen Burnie, like you thought.
-Yes.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.745
And it looks like Frank Perotta died

39:28.750 --> 39:31.457
in a suspicious hunting accident
with his son.

39:32.250 --> 39:35.378
-How long ago?
-Thirty years. He was 17.

39:35.380 --> 39:38.076
And my guess is it was no accident.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.911
Well, you said Vincent was
looking for bigger prey.

39:39.920 --> 39:43.321
-Sounds like he found it.
-Garcia, you're my girl. Thank you.

39:56.580 --> 39:57.660
Clear.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.206
Clear.

40:01.830 --> 40:03.457
-Kitchen _clear.
-Upstairs?

40:03.460 --> 40:04.495
Clear.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.036
We got a friendly. It's Baker.

40:20.420 --> 40:22.240
Get out.
-OFFICER: Let's get an ambulance.

40:22.250 --> 40:24.741
-Get out. Get out.
-Get dispatch.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.826
Get off. Get off. Get off.

40:28.500 --> 40:32.823
-Jimmy. You all right, man -He's going to live.

40:33.920 --> 40:35.319
Get off!

40:36.830 --> 40:39.207
You're going to be all right, Jimmy.

40:39.210 --> 40:42.373
You were just responding
to what you learned, Vincent.

40:42.670 --> 40:44.410
When you grow up
in an environment like that,

40:44.420 --> 40:46.820
an extremely abusive,
violent household,

40:48.000 --> 40:51.572
it's not surprising that some people
grow up to become killers.

40:56.460 --> 40:57.609
Some people?

40:58.330 --> 40:59.570
What's that?

40:59.580 --> 41:02.322
You said some people
grow up to become killers.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.571
And some people
grow up to catch them.

41:30.040 --> 41:33.669
Carl Jung said, "The healthy
man does not torture others.

41:33.670 --> 41:37.618
"Generally it is the tortured
who turn into torturers."
