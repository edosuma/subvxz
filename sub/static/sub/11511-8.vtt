You don't do for me

04:10.964 --> 04:12.913
Terry made a threat, and I said nothing.

04:12.947 --> 04:14.716
I-I should have been
there to protect her.

04:14.748 --> 04:15.883
I should have...

04:15.917 --> 04:18.119
I might have had something
to do with it.

to stand down with Dooley,

04:22.991 --> 04:24.126
I couldn't do it.

04:24.159 --> 04:25.381
I was too pissed off about Boots.

04:25.893 --> 04:28.028
So, I told the 7-7s where he was,

04:28.598 --> 04:29.965
and they hit his house, took him out.

04:29.998 --> 04:31.099
What are you saying?

04:31.131 --> 04:32.242
You're saying Dooley's dead?

04:32.633 --> 04:34.970
I didn't do it, but I saw it happen.

04:36.970 --> 04:38.939
What are thinking, man?

04:38.972 --> 04:40.117
We spoke about this!

04:40.726 --> 04:41.743
What are you thinking?

04:41.775 --> 04:43.189
It's not just him, okay?

04:43.516 --> 04:46.614
I went to pick him up,
and we took some drugs

04:46.647 --> 04:48.082
and some cash that was laying around...

04:48.116 --> 04:49.116
You did wh...? Oh, that's great.

04:49.150 --> 04:51.393
Both of you... why do you
make this so hard, man?

04:51.693 --> 04:53.326
I know. I understand. I...

04:53.351 --> 04:54.723
You don't know. You
don't understand, Gil.

04:54.756 --> 04:55.870
If you did, you wouldn't do it.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.662
Ray Carroll's got a safe...

05:01.733 --> 05:03.063
...and I think he's got pictures in it.

05:03.097 --> 05:03.929
What?

05:04.205 --> 05:06.167
When I was in Austin with the campaign,

05:06.200 --> 05:08.936
some donor guy got drunk
and started talking about it.

05:08.970 --> 05:11.640
- And apparently, it's at his ranch.
- What ranch?

05:11.672 --> 05:13.608
Some hunting place outside of Houston.

05:13.792 --> 05:16.043
Oh, this is good.
Whatever's in that safe...

05:16.077 --> 05:18.213
that could be the key to
bringing him to his knees.

05:18.246 --> 05:19.476
You've been to this ranch?

05:19.508 --> 05:22.116
No, but I can find out where it is.

05:22.150 --> 05:23.784
I just think, instead of fighting,

05:23.818 --> 05:25.053
we keep our eye on the ball. I mean,

05:25.085 --> 05:26.631
this guy seemed really scared.

05:26.665 --> 05:29.524
And I bet you Carroll's
blackmail stuff's in there.

05:29.556 --> 05:31.367
All right, you three should
go out there, check it out.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.287
What about Annie and Baby Boots?

05:33.628 --> 05:35.248
I mean, Terry went after Marina, right?

05:35.281 --> 05:37.412
What's to stop him from going
after all of our people?

05:37.444 --> 05:39.768
Listen, go pick 'em up and
bring 'em over to our place.

05:39.801 --> 05:41.970
We can hole up there till
this thing blows over.

05:42.459 --> 05:43.806

05:43.837 --> 05:45.806
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

05:45.840 --> 05:47.842
I'm so sorry.

05:54.147 --> 05:56.951
The only reason I told you
about Jackson and the DEA

05:56.984 --> 05:58.986
was to keep you current.

05:59.020 --> 06:01.637
Not so you could go and
attack the man's fiancée.

06:01.712 --> 06:03.727
You know, it wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

06:04.079 --> 06:05.871
I was actually looking
for Jackson, not her.

06:05.896 --> 06:08.864
It wasn't supposed to go down at all!

06:10.931 --> 06:13.517
There's a plan in place
for Jackson Brooks,

06:13.550 --> 06:15.904
and not a single human in the species

06:15.936 --> 06:17.300
is welcome to deviate from it.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.818
Now tell me you understand that, Terry.

06:19.968 --> 06:21.670
Or else me and some of the people

06:21.704 --> 06:22.672
that help keep you in business

06:22.704 --> 06:25.741
might need to start taking
a hard line here.

06:25.774 --> 06:27.743
You know, I think
I had just about enough

06:27.776 --> 06:29.378
of you rolling up in here

06:29.411 --> 06:30.860
and telling me what I can and can't do.

06:31.447 --> 06:33.016
You watch your mouth now.

06:33.844 --> 06:35.484
You need me more than I need you.

06:36.219 --> 06:37.486

06:37.875 --> 06:40.522

06:41.891 --> 06:43.893

start running things

06:53.900 --> 06:56.211
Gonna get your own supply line going?

06:56.548 --> 06:57.907
Using what route?

06:58.569 --> 06:59.752

08:36.311 --> 08:37.546
use him as a human shield,

strap dynamite to the safe and

09:44.046 --> 09:46.715
Actually, he's, a... he's
a really amazing chef.

09:46.748 --> 09:48.283
Like a chef, chef.

09:48.316 --> 09:50.064
He has all his hair.

09:50.096 --> 09:52.287
He treats me all right.

09:53.354 --> 09:55.563
Is my bar set too low? I'm sorry.

09:55.588 --> 09:57.759
I've been divorced twice
if that tells you anything.

09:57.793 --> 09:59.928
Oh, it tells me
two guys somewhere are idiots.

10:00.995 --> 10:02.364
- Hey!
- Oh, Boots!

10:02.397 --> 10:04.254
- How are you, sweetie?
- Boots!

10:04.287 --> 10:05.572
Oh, man.

10:05.604 --> 10:06.870
- I'm so happy for you.
- Wow.

10:06.895 --> 10:09.262
Hey, uh, this is my wife, uh, Annie.

10:09.295 --> 10:11.921
- Jessie West, my wife.
- Oh, my. Oh!

10:11.954 --> 10:13.875
I've got to go schmooze
with my Arkansas cousins,

10:13.908 --> 10:15.244
uh, but I will be back in a second,

10:15.277 --> 10:16.779
and we'll talk.
It's so great seeing you.

10:16.812 --> 10:17.946
Nice to meet you.

10:17.979 --> 10:21.283
(laughter)

10:21.316 --> 10:22.610
Well...

10:24.019 --> 10:25.937
Uh, so, can I get you a drink?

10:25.971 --> 10:28.180
Oh, I'm-I'm sure
my boyfriend's doing that.

10:28.205 --> 10:29.287
Oh.

10:32.473 --> 10:33.361
Well, hey, listen, I got a...

10:33.394 --> 10:34.712
I got a secret stash in the back.

10:34.746 --> 10:36.246
We don't have to wait
in line or anything, so...

10:36.271 --> 10:37.087
Thank you.

10:37.138 --> 10:38.271
How've you been? I want
to hear everything.

10:38.296 --> 10:39.692
Yes.

10:43.394 --> 10:44.673
So we all good?

10:45.072 --> 10:46.985
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

10:50.155 --> 10:51.905
I'll let you get back to it.

10:53.577 --> 10:55.315
(chuckles)

11:15.504 --> 11:18.324
Well... broke some chains
last night, Liz.

11:19.039 --> 11:20.551
Ain't nobody telling me
what to do anymore.

11:20.584 --> 11:21.576
Must be nice.

11:22.344 --> 11:24.714
Is that the reason you called me
out of an interview?

11:25.717 --> 11:27.640
Lawyer named Jackson Brooks.

11:27.982 --> 11:29.184
I want him arrested.

11:29.484 --> 11:31.286
- Jackson Brooks.
- Yeah.

11:31.318 --> 11:32.487
On what charge?

11:32.520 --> 11:33.328
Murder.

11:34.255 --> 11:36.225
(scoffs)

11:36.258 --> 11:38.544
Look into the disappearance
of a man named Red Tyson.

11:38.894 --> 11:40.922
A guard from Quitman a while back.

11:41.529 --> 11:43.499
Little bird told me
that you'll find the counselor

11:43.532 --> 11:44.701
at the bottom of that mystery.

11:44.734 --> 11:46.769
I've looked into him before.
He's represented

11:46.802 --> 11:48.403
his share of scumbags,
but he's straight.

11:48.436 --> 11:50.473
You're wrong, Detective.

11:52.738 --> 11:54.586
Jackson Brooks is a killer.

12:04.152 --> 12:06.989
Shotguns, handguns, semiautomatics.

12:07.022 --> 12:09.458
I got sawed-offs, assault rifles,

12:09.483 --> 12:11.285
I got Desert Eagles for days.

12:13.294 --> 12:14.984
Piece like that will cost you.

12:15.897 --> 12:18.962
Uh, me forgetting your face'll
cost you a little bit more.

12:46.909 --> 12:48.361
Unacceptable.

12:50.407 --> 12:52.144
The governor of Texas himself

12:52.453 --> 12:55.209
is going to be endorsing
my husband... your boss...

12:55.242 --> 12:57.992
less than a week from today,
and you lose the venue?

12:58.026 --> 13:00.318
It's a country club, CeCe.

13:00.351 --> 13:02.750
Their membership overturned hosting us.

13:03.353 --> 13:04.620
JESSIE: Well, what about your ranch?

13:05.293 --> 13:06.920
Boys in Austin were talking about it.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.545
Rolling hills, picture perfect.

13:09.578 --> 13:11.379
I mean, couldn't we just
do the endorsement there?

13:11.412 --> 13:13.645
(sighs) Could.

13:13.678 --> 13:15.788
I mean, if you can get me out
there and see what kind of setup

13:15.822 --> 13:17.732
we're talking about, and you
could keep the announcement date

13:17.765 --> 13:19.635
before the <i>Chronicle</i> leaks a headline.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.128
You know what, we could even go today.

13:23.461 --> 13:26.341
You know what... sold.

13:26.964 --> 13:29.611
I was planning on taking my
grandson out there later anyway.

13:30.208 --> 13:31.246
You can tag along.

13:33.782 --> 13:36.385
(low, indistinct conversation)

13:36.700 --> 13:37.786
- Speak of the devil.
- Your ears

13:37.818 --> 13:39.554
must have been burning... Diana was just

13:39.587 --> 13:41.789
asking me about your history.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.659
What are-what are you doing here?

13:43.692 --> 13:45.260
What do you mean? I am...

13:45.690 --> 13:47.428
I'm visiting your fiancée.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.549
I've seen you with Ray Carroll.

13:50.966 --> 13:53.663
Well, that's not
out of the realm of possibility.

13:54.155 --> 13:55.996
The man is running for congress,

13:56.030 --> 13:57.806
after all, and I am
his biggest supporter.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.839
Jackson, what's going on?

13:58.872 --> 14:00.541
I have history...

14:00.575 --> 14:02.041
with Ray Carroll.

14:03.297 --> 14:04.245
Nine months in Quitman.

14:04.279 --> 14:05.681
But you already know that, don't you?

14:06.270 --> 14:07.348
Not sure I like your tone.

14:07.381 --> 14:08.950
Jackson, what's gotten into you?

14:08.984 --> 14:10.552
Baby, this woman is a liar.

14:11.679 --> 14:14.356
Any firm in Texas would've
killed to have your business,

14:14.389 --> 14:15.990
but you came to ours out of the blue,

14:16.024 --> 14:17.659
unsolicited. Why?

14:17.692 --> 14:19.894
You are supposed to be
exceptional lawyers,

14:19.928 --> 14:21.296
are you not?

14:21.328 --> 14:22.496
What's your angle?

14:23.274 --> 14:25.299
Ray Carroll send you to get
close to me, to my fiancée,

14:25.332 --> 14:26.367
- is that it?
- Jackson.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.246
- Is that why you're here?
- Jackson,

14:28.280 --> 14:29.197
- enough.
- Is that-is that it?

14:29.230 --> 14:30.629
- Jackson... Diana...
- Is that what you're doing here?

14:30.663 --> 14:32.841
You just focus
on your recovery, sweetie.

14:33.356 --> 14:34.877
And I will come back at a better time.

14:36.477 --> 14:39.098
And I'm going to assume,
Mr. Brooks, that your attacks

14:39.132 --> 14:41.984
on my character are borne out of
the impotence that you must feel

14:42.016 --> 14:44.352
out of not being able
to protect your loved ones.

14:44.385 --> 14:45.953
And if that were not the case, then you

14:45.986 --> 14:48.490
and your firm would owe me the
world's most sincere apology.

14:48.523 --> 14:50.382
And you still might.

14:56.497 --> 14:58.075
TERRY: <i>You remember
how, when we was young,</i>

14:58.108 --> 15:00.277
we had plans to run the entire gang,

15:00.310 --> 15:02.179
top to bottom, wholesale to the streets?

15:02.213 --> 15:03.727
Terry, that was a long time ago.

15:03.761 --> 15:05.085
Yeah, well, it's time

15:05.784 --> 15:07.740
to bring that plan into effect.

15:07.936 --> 15:09.795
All right, now, look, I'm out
from under the warden.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.356
So I'm gonna need to get a sit-down

15:12.390 --> 15:14.857
with the cartel's man
down here in Houston.

15:15.293 --> 15:16.622
You still in touch with Pablo

15:16.655 --> 15:18.280
- from back in the day?
- Not at all.

15:18.555 --> 15:19.914
Well, get in touch with him.

15:20.372 --> 15:21.882
You two were pretty tight back then.

15:22.274 --> 15:23.545
Tell him I need to see him.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.980
Terry, I have no desire to set
foot back in that world again.

15:27.376 --> 15:28.714
- There is no way...
- No, no,

15:28.747 --> 15:31.311
pause, pause. I ain't got time
to argue with you, little bro.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.301
Call Pablo.

15:33.988 --> 15:36.288
You able to get that meet,

15:36.322 --> 15:38.091
I can get the rest of these
birds up out of this church.

15:38.124 --> 15:39.192
The rest of 'em?

15:39.225 --> 15:41.423
I thought you was taking
everything with you right now.

15:41.448 --> 15:42.933
Just keeping a small reserve.

15:43.361 --> 15:44.741
Inventory management.

15:47.799 --> 15:49.368
I need that meeting, all right?

15:49.401 --> 15:50.973
Make it happen.

15:52.093 --> 15:53.073
I'll see you later.

15:56.241 --> 15:59.746
(doors closes)

16:00.136 --> 16:02.360
WINTERS: A guard named Red Tyson,

16:02.781 --> 16:04.119
did he transfer over?

16:04.449 --> 16:06.584
No, he vanished sometime in

16:07.053 --> 16:09.022
'98 if memory serves.

16:09.054 --> 16:12.061
I mean, that guy, he disappeared.

16:12.757 --> 16:14.092
Any idea what happened to him?

16:14.383 --> 16:15.794
He was at work one day,

16:15.828 --> 16:17.423
next day he wasn't
is what happened to him.

16:17.896 --> 16:19.799
He was dumb as a dollar watch.

16:19.832 --> 16:22.001
Just like that Bobby Marks,
his running buddy?

16:22.034 --> 16:23.703
Those two were peas in a pod.

16:24.970 --> 16:27.373
Any idea where I might find Mr. Marks?

16:27.833 --> 16:29.367
You're a detective, ain't you?

16:31.380 --> 16:32.541
Detect.

16:47.025 --> 16:48.629
RAY: Sweet Amy Reese.

16:52.162 --> 16:53.366
What's it been, old gal...

16:53.746 --> 16:55.218
a couple of decades?

16:57.502 --> 16:58.474
You look tired.

16:59.337 --> 17:00.716
Not you.

17:01.207 --> 17:02.841
You done pretty good for yourself.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.474
I owe it to being careful.

17:07.011 --> 17:08.907
You remember Bobby Marks?

17:09.248 --> 17:12.219
Someone pointed some trouble
in his direction.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.220
Figuring it was you who did it,

17:14.252 --> 17:17.856
I've had a man parked across
the street from you ever since.

17:17.888 --> 17:20.271
He tells me you've had
some interesting guests.

17:21.358 --> 17:23.832
The name Shawn Cook ring a bell?

17:24.530 --> 17:26.397
I don't need to say nothing to you.

17:26.432 --> 17:27.799
That's all right.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.235
I'm not really here to listen.

17:38.722 --> 17:40.933
Hey, so what's the story?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.828
Well, got our in at the ranch.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.931
Jessie convinced the warden's
wife to have some party there.

17:45.963 --> 17:47.165
Gonna go check it out in a bit.

17:47.199 --> 17:48.433
She's going alone?

17:48.467 --> 17:49.767
No, I'm going with her.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.002
Oh, wait a second, Gil, you should...

17:51.036 --> 17:52.938
No, it's cool, Jackie. We have a plan.

17:53.346 --> 17:54.172
Gonna sneak in with Jessie.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.141
They won't even know I'm there.

17:55.549 --> 17:57.776
Got to figure out a way
to get into the safe.

17:57.808 --> 17:59.844
I'm pretty sure
that ain't the answer, bro.

18:01.885 --> 18:03.165
So, where's Jessie?

18:05.005 --> 18:06.784
(knocking)

18:06.817 --> 18:08.119
(hinges creak)

18:08.152 --> 18:08.992
Hey.

18:09.509 --> 18:11.123
Can I talk to you for a second?

18:11.856 --> 18:13.298
Really not the best idea.

18:13.691 --> 18:15.527
I heard about the plan.

18:15.559 --> 18:16.928
You guys gonna be okay?

18:18.028 --> 18:19.513
You came all the way
up here to ask me that?

18:24.236 --> 18:26.104
(chuckles) I, uh,

18:26.136 --> 18:28.673
I... I came here

18:28.707 --> 18:30.347
to say that last night...

18:31.642 --> 18:33.745
it was, uh, careless.

18:34.034 --> 18:36.815
We got swept away.

18:36.847 --> 18:39.084
And I-I don't want to hurt
people that I care about.

18:39.116 --> 18:40.085
Neither do I.

18:40.117 --> 18:41.686
It was a mistake, and I don't know

18:41.719 --> 18:43.555
how it got here,
but we-we-we shouldn't...

18:43.587 --> 18:44.721
Jackson, it didn't happen.

18:46.114 --> 18:47.493
I agree with you.

18:49.126 --> 18:50.618
So let's just drop it, okay?

18:51.729 --> 18:53.731
(chuckles)

18:55.866 --> 18:57.135
What is this?

18:58.870 --> 19:01.006
You're snooping in my drawers, really?

19:01.038 --> 19:02.566
Since when do you own a gun?

19:02.891 --> 19:04.543
It's not mine. Belonged to Boots.

19:04.575 --> 19:05.844
Annie asked me to get rid of it.

19:07.378 --> 19:08.426
So, why haven't you?

19:11.832 --> 19:13.267
(laughs)

19:13.299 --> 19:15.335
(speaking Spanish)

19:15.369 --> 19:16.670
My man, Dennis Lowen.

19:16.702 --> 19:18.637
Big P. What's up, Big P?

19:18.670 --> 19:21.070
So, tell me, man,
how's the Jesus business?

19:21.178 --> 19:22.976
Well, not as good
as the <i>vato</i> business, huh?

19:23.008 --> 19:25.377
What, this? This is nothing.

19:25.410 --> 19:26.679
Using the church as a front?

19:26.712 --> 19:28.814
Now that's some <i>cojones</i> worth having.

19:28.848 --> 19:30.350
Yeah, except it's not a front,
it's legit.

19:30.382 --> 19:32.842
Like I told you, I'm on
the straight and narrow, man.

19:33.518 --> 19:35.211
I came to ask you a favor.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.290
It's for my brother.

19:38.100 --> 19:39.960
Now, hear me out, hear me out.

19:40.308 --> 19:42.395
Terry wants to have
a sit-down with the big boss.

19:42.428 --> 19:44.231
He's got a business proposition for him.

19:44.264 --> 19:47.234
Hey, he'll make it worth your while.

19:47.789 --> 19:49.237
What you get out of it?

19:49.502 --> 19:51.871
Another headache off my plate.

19:53.872 --> 19:54.975
(laughs) All right.

19:55.007 --> 19:56.776
I'll see what I can do.

20:08.587 --> 20:09.922
WOMAN (calling): Bobby ain't been home!

20:10.980 --> 20:13.144
In fact, I ain't seen him for a while.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.327
Do you know Mr. Marks?

20:15.361 --> 20:16.496
Yeah.

20:16.528 --> 20:17.882
Since I've been the manager.

20:18.297 --> 20:20.400
He was too cheap to rent a marina slip,

20:20.792 --> 20:22.670
so I let him set up shop out here.

20:22.701 --> 20:24.470
Any idea where I might find him?

20:24.765 --> 20:26.414
No. Not really.

20:26.906 --> 20:29.598
His car's been gone.
His rent's not paid.

20:29.909 --> 20:32.007
But this ain't like him to run off.

20:32.842 --> 20:33.814
Especially since he'd

20:33.845 --> 20:35.614
rather live here than anywhere else.

20:35.648 --> 20:37.884
That is until such time
somebody wrestles this country

20:37.917 --> 20:39.987
back from the claws of hell.

20:41.521 --> 20:43.425
Has he had any visitors recently?

20:43.740 --> 20:45.008
I don't get out here much.

20:45.557 --> 20:47.993
But I did see some people
coming through the guard gate

20:48.026 --> 20:50.383
a while back, city types.

20:50.697 --> 20:52.408
Two white fellas and a black 'un.

20:55.530 --> 20:56.911
Thank you.

20:57.836 --> 20:59.806
(phone ringing)

21:00.872 --> 21:02.708
- Hey, Liz, what's up?
- You still throwing it

21:02.742 --> 21:04.611
in that cute little DA
you had on the side?

21:04.996 --> 21:06.047
Well, that's crude.

21:06.635 --> 21:07.403
But yeah.

21:07.746 --> 21:09.015
Think you can get a warrant
out of her for me?

21:09.047 --> 21:10.650
I need you to go up on a cell phone

21:10.682 --> 21:12.423
for a Bobby or Robert Marks.

21:12.785 --> 21:14.502
See if you can find his last ping.

21:14.821 --> 21:16.956
(phone beeps off)

21:16.988 --> 21:18.824
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

21:18.858 --> 21:20.560
(knocking)

21:24.342 --> 21:25.966
Well, I have

21:25.997 --> 21:27.866
some good news and good news.

21:28.366 --> 21:29.969
Could you use either one
of those right now?

21:30.743 --> 21:31.939
All your test results came back normal,

21:31.970 --> 21:33.573
so we're sending you home in a bit.

21:33.963 --> 21:35.708
And more importantly, the injuries

21:35.742 --> 21:37.022
didn't affect your pregnancy.

21:40.112 --> 21:41.478
I'm sorry, the what?

21:41.714 --> 21:43.683
Oh, uh, you didn't know.

21:43.716 --> 21:45.084
Uh, beta hCG suggests

21:45.118 --> 21:46.493
you're 12 weeks pregnant.

21:48.189 --> 21:49.038
Congratulations.

21:53.726 --> 21:57.664
- Hey. You are so cute.
- (jabbers)

21:57.697 --> 21:59.431
You got a good one here.

22:00.238 --> 22:03.436
When Jessie was a baby,
she cried all the time.

22:03.468 --> 22:06.123
Oh, he has his moments.

22:06.471 --> 22:08.574
But I think he likes you.

22:08.608 --> 22:10.744
Hey. Y'all seen my cell phone anywhere?

22:10.776 --> 22:12.946
- I can't remember where I left it.
- It's right here.

22:16.615 --> 22:20.152
(groans, clicks tongue) It's from Amy.

22:20.186 --> 22:22.155
- I found something you need to see.
- What's wrong?

22:22.188 --> 22:25.592
I found proof. I can help you boys.

22:25.624 --> 22:28.398
Nothing. It's good news. Listen,

22:28.423 --> 22:30.079
I'll be back later, okay?

22:38.207 --> 22:39.539
This a bad time?

22:39.572 --> 22:42.508
Yeah, it's a perfect time
if you want to blow our cover.

22:43.006 --> 22:44.711
(chuckles) What are you wearing?

22:44.744 --> 22:46.079
I'm hanging up, Gil.

22:46.112 --> 22:48.259
Come on! What? Am I being inappropriate?

22:48.496 --> 22:49.883
Listen, I'm gonna get you to laugh today

22:49.916 --> 22:51.518
- if it's the last thing I do...
- (phone beeps off)

22:53.652 --> 22:56.756
(brakes squeak)

22:56.788 --> 22:59.025
Hey, you're a much better driver
from the trunk!

22:59.057 --> 23:01.060
(chuckles)

23:03.028 --> 23:06.865
I just want to raise a glass
to my friend Boots

23:07.518 --> 23:09.038
and his beautiful bride, Annie.

23:09.564 --> 23:11.461
You guys bring out the best
in each other,

23:12.191 --> 23:13.605
and you make the rest of us
better people

23:13.639 --> 23:14.740
just by being our friends.

23:15.860 --> 23:18.794
What you guys have is
what every heart should want.

23:20.306 --> 23:22.865
Annie, you made
a lucky guy out of Boots.

23:24.202 --> 23:25.232
And, uh,

23:25.852 --> 23:26.868
Boots,

23:27.780 --> 23:29.364
as always, brother,

23:30.748 --> 23:32.057
you give me something to shoot for

23:32.091 --> 23:33.525
when I'm aiming to be a better man.

23:33.558 --> 23:36.128
So...

23:36.161 --> 23:38.236
thank you for that. I love you.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.533
Congratulations, brother. Raise 'em up.

23:40.565 --> 23:42.134
(cheering and applause)

23:42.168 --> 23:44.670
(chuckles)

23:56.536 --> 23:57.217
Amy.

23:57.249 --> 23:59.194
It's me. I got your message.

24:02.779 --> 24:03.989
Amy.

24:10.499 --> 24:11.730
Amy.

24:23.743 --> 24:24.897
Hello?

24:26.897 --> 24:28.018
Amy?

24:34.649 --> 24:36.024
It's Shawn.

24:36.656 --> 24:38.658
(knocking)

24:47.307 --> 24:48.276
Amy.

24:50.522 --> 24:51.671
Amy!

24:51.704 --> 24:52.988
Amy, no.

24:57.984 --> 24:59.686
(grunting)

24:59.911 --> 25:01.780
Amy, no.

25:05.918 --> 25:07.920
(indistinct radio transmission)

25:12.783 --> 25:13.991
Shawnie.

25:16.478 --> 25:17.977
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

25:18.804 --> 25:20.508
I did this to her, Jackie.

25:20.940 --> 25:23.441
She said she found something
I needed to see,

25:23.475 --> 25:24.384
and now she's dead.

25:25.243 --> 25:27.243
Hung from a damn rod like an animal.

25:27.332 --> 25:29.270
This is not your fault, Shawn.

25:31.170 --> 25:32.750
You tell the police that?

25:37.222 --> 25:39.078
They're gonna want to talk to you again,

25:39.110 --> 25:40.958
but right now they think it's a suicide.

25:41.090 --> 25:44.326
Yeah. Just the way
the warden wanted it, right?

25:45.151 --> 25:47.620
Now if we go around saying
some guy running for congress

25:47.653 --> 25:48.263
did this, they're...

25:48.288 --> 25:50.022
Yeah, they're gonna
think we're all crazy.

25:50.056 --> 25:52.170
Yeah, well, whatever she found, Jackie,

25:52.558 --> 25:53.925
it wasn't worth it.

25:54.292 --> 25:55.628
She's dead.

25:56.261 --> 25:57.924
Marina is in the hospital.

26:00.445 --> 26:01.653
Gil's right.

26:02.777 --> 26:05.737
Hittin' those bastards
where they live is the answer.

26:05.770 --> 26:07.888
(gurney clacking)

26:12.744 --> 26:15.214
(doors closing)

26:16.449 --> 26:17.784
I'm sorry.

26:17.817 --> 26:19.405
Hey. It's not your fault.

26:19.751 --> 26:21.687
(crying)

26:25.723 --> 26:28.694
- (imitates airplane engine)
- (chuckles)

26:29.613 --> 26:30.729
Hmm.

26:32.435 --> 26:34.155
You're absolutely right.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.244
Look at this, it's perfect.

26:37.523 --> 26:39.979
- (sighs)
- We can put the stage over there.

26:40.011 --> 26:41.005
Mm-hmm.

26:41.039 --> 26:42.836
Two tents, four peaks apiece.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.712
- Mm-hmm.
- Bar over there.

26:46.293 --> 26:47.679
Why didn't I think of this?

26:47.713 --> 26:49.749
Oh, you would have. Eventually.

26:49.781 --> 26:51.016
Hmm. (chuckles)

26:51.049 --> 26:52.479
Should we go inside and draw
up some plans?

26:52.504 --> 26:53.815
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay.

26:53.849 --> 26:56.655
Charlie, come on, sweetie. (chuckles)

26:58.691 --> 27:00.693
(beeps)

27:24.316 --> 27:25.785
(keys jangle)

27:38.551 --> 27:39.831
- (knocking)
- Hey, Uncle D.

27:39.865 --> 27:40.799
- Have you seen my...
- Leesha.

27:41.500 --> 27:42.501
Oh, my God.

27:44.208 --> 27:45.784
Is that what I think it is?

27:46.838 --> 27:48.487
Leesha,

27:49.441 --> 27:50.676
let me explain. Listen,

27:50.832 --> 27:53.126
I know it looks bad, but...

27:53.811 --> 27:57.014
remember, honey, when we were
talking about teachable moments?

27:57.951 --> 27:59.942
Does my father know about this?

28:02.922 --> 28:04.303
No, baby, he...

28:04.790 --> 28:06.658
he has no idea.

28:13.209 --> 28:14.166
(door opens)

28:14.200 --> 28:15.279
- Leesh...
- (door closes)

28:18.915 --> 28:20.446
You sure this is the place?

28:20.838 --> 28:22.875
I told you I'd get you
within two football fields

28:22.907 --> 28:24.910
of the last ping of that cell,
and this is it.

28:25.889 --> 28:27.760
Now, you should be looking at a lake.

28:28.547 --> 28:29.978
Yeah, I see it.

28:30.838 --> 28:31.766
I'm pulling over now.

28:37.742 --> 28:39.110
According to the cell records,

28:39.524 --> 28:42.636
Bobby's last ping was somewhere
close to where you're standing.

28:44.930 --> 28:46.933
(whirring)

28:51.674 --> 28:52.642
Stupid safe.

28:52.905 --> 28:54.188
Who are you?

28:55.726 --> 28:57.695
Hey, little man. I'm, uh...

28:58.308 --> 29:00.275
I'm John, a friend of your grandpa's.

29:01.133 --> 29:02.348
What are you doing?

29:02.880 --> 29:05.584
Uh, well, I have a surprise for him.

29:05.617 --> 29:08.059
But it's-it's in here,
and I can't get the door open.

29:09.052 --> 29:10.633
We're not supposed to go in there.

29:10.878 --> 29:12.635
Grandpa says it's dangerous.

29:12.678 --> 29:15.660
Right. Well... that's too bad.

29:15.694 --> 29:18.359
'Cause it's-it's a really cool surprise.

29:37.915 --> 29:39.324
Will this open that door?

29:39.684 --> 29:40.532
Yeah.

29:41.686 --> 29:43.990
I'm not supposed to be in here.

29:44.022 --> 29:45.446
Right. Well, uh, what's your name?

29:45.857 --> 29:47.926
- Charlie.
- Okay, Charlie,

29:47.960 --> 29:49.820
I'll tell you what. I don't
want you to get in trouble,

29:49.853 --> 29:52.960
so I won't tell anyone that I saw you

29:52.994 --> 29:54.241
if you don't tell anyone you saw me.

29:55.137 --> 29:56.593
Think you can do that for me?

29:58.436 --> 29:59.948
I will for 20 bucks.

30:00.638 --> 30:02.007
(chuckles)

30:02.366 --> 30:03.892
You are a Carroll.

30:05.330 --> 30:07.419
All right.

30:18.057 --> 30:19.076
Hold on, please.

30:19.724 --> 30:20.938
Arms up.

30:34.072 --> 30:36.023
I ordered you a drink.

30:38.656 --> 30:40.040
Where's Pablo?

30:41.671 --> 30:43.611
He won't be joining us today.

30:46.559 --> 30:47.529
Who the hell are you?

30:47.745 --> 30:49.558
I am your benefactor.

30:50.489 --> 30:53.059
I make it possible for
you to do what you do

30:53.091 --> 30:54.430
by doing what I do.

30:54.826 --> 30:56.282
Which is what?

30:56.861 --> 30:57.960
Everything.

31:07.594 --> 31:08.521
Have a seat.

31:10.376 --> 31:12.401
My name is Diana Stockman,

31:13.111 --> 31:15.902
and I have ears
in every boardroom and back room

31:15.936 --> 31:18.491
and courthouse in Texas
and all its neighboring states.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.619
And I have enough
important men on my payroll

31:21.653 --> 31:23.087
to fill a truck full of ledgers.

31:23.398 --> 31:27.080
And I have inserted myself
between you and my friends

31:27.114 --> 31:30.029
in the cartel because
I want to make you an offer,

31:30.695 --> 31:32.299
which I will make only once.

31:32.945 --> 31:35.755
I'm gonna double your empire,
Terrence, so smile.

31:36.434 --> 31:37.864
But in exchange,

31:37.889 --> 31:42.287
you have to promise
to leave Jackson Brooks alone,

31:42.774 --> 31:44.222
since I have plans for him.

31:44.643 --> 31:45.492
And you have to end

31:45.517 --> 31:48.023
your measuring contest with Ray Carroll.

31:49.759 --> 31:52.026
Which I'm sure you'd certainly win.

31:53.819 --> 31:55.344
The warden's on your payroll?

31:55.699 --> 31:59.511
Agree to my terms and I am going
to open up things to you

31:59.544 --> 32:02.029
that you are going to love.

32:03.955 --> 32:05.356
The Port of Houston, for one.

32:06.432 --> 32:09.023
'Cause you can push more weight on ships

32:09.194 --> 32:11.605
than you ever could on trains.

32:12.008 --> 32:15.633
So, aside from keeping
your product flowing,

32:15.666 --> 32:19.069
I am gonna keep the cops off your back

32:19.104 --> 32:21.240
and your enemies in jail.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.115
And all you need to do

32:23.807 --> 32:25.268
is behave.

32:30.918 --> 32:31.715
Hey.

32:33.851 --> 32:35.686
Uh, wh-what's going on?

32:35.720 --> 32:37.357
I'm being discharged.

32:37.722 --> 32:39.564
My parents are waiting downstairs.

32:40.157 --> 32:41.787
I'm gonna be staying with them.

32:42.350 --> 32:43.718
Baby, no, no.

32:43.861 --> 32:45.797
Look, if you're worried
about coming home,

32:45.830 --> 32:46.865
I will be there.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.470
Marina, give me a chance
to make this right.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.406
I-I can fix this.

32:54.739 --> 32:56.519
It's beyond fixing, Jackson.

32:58.546 --> 33:00.659
The lying is bad enough, but then y...

33:01.546 --> 33:03.894
you come in here and you
accuse Diana of wh...

33:03.927 --> 33:06.850
whatever that was with
Ray Carroll, and you tell her

33:06.875 --> 33:08.850
about Quitman... I mean,
you're acting crazy.

33:08.875 --> 33:10.822
There's a reason for it, I promise you.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.962
I want to keep you safe.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.295
I will tell you everything.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.885
I just need more time.
