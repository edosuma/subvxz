WEBVTT

00:09.810 --> 00:11.145
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR

00:11.179 --> 00:12.780
* ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX *

00:12.813 --> 00:13.781
* TAKE IT, DUDE

00:13.814 --> 00:21.755
*

00:31.865 --> 00:33.467
* ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR

00:33.501 --> 00:38.339
*

00:40.441 --> 00:45.279
- MM, HERE WE ARE IN FRONT
OF THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE.

00:45.313 --> 00:48.682
AND HERE WE ARE
IN FRONT OF THE SACRE-COEUR.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.818
- [snoring]

00:50.851 --> 00:53.687
- OH, AND HERE WE ARE
IN FRONT OF NAPOLEON'S TOMB.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.257
- LUCKY HIM.
HE'S DEAD.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.159
- AND HERE I AM PLAYING

00:58.192 --> 00:59.660
A LOAF OF FRENCH BREAD,
LIKE I'M STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.263
- WOULD YOU TWO CUT IT OUT?
- MA, YOU'RE INTERRUPTING.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.498
- WELL, I HATE IT WHEN COUPLES
MAKE OUT IN FRONT OF YOU.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.300
- IT'S FRENCH.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.701
WE'RE FRENCHING.

01:07.735 --> 01:08.602
- AND WITH THAT,

01:08.636 --> 01:13.307
DAVID AND MICHAEL
BID ADIEU TO PARIS.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.642
FIN.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.144
THAT MEANS "THE END."

01:16.177 --> 01:18.679
- BON. THAT MEANS "GOOD."

01:18.712 --> 01:20.781
- WELL, I HOPE EVERYONE
WASN'T TOO BORED.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.217
- NO.
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

01:23.251 --> 01:25.386
I HAVEN'T BEEN
THAT ENTERTAINED SINCE GANDHI.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.156
- OH, IT JUST LOOKED LIKE
THE TRIP OF A LIFETIME.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.124
- IT SURE FELT THAT LONG.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.892
- THE THING YOU HAVE TO
REMEMBER ABOUT PARIS

01:31.925 --> 01:34.395
IS NOT DINING
AT LUCAS-CARTON,

01:34.428 --> 01:37.898
OR SHOPPING
ON THE RUE DE SAINT-SULPICE.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.168
IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.170
YOU KNOW,
SHARING A BAGUETTE

01:42.203 --> 01:43.637
WHILE STROLLING
SUR LA SEINE...

01:43.671 --> 01:46.340
- THE SUR LE WHAT, HONEY?
- THE SEINE, MOTHER.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.541
- IT'S A RIVER.

01:47.575 --> 01:48.542
- THANKS, BABY.
- MM-HMM.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.312
- WOULD ANYONE
LIKE SOME, UH, VIN ROUGE?

01:51.345 --> 01:53.214
- LUCY, YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

01:53.247 --> 01:55.583
BETWEEN VIN ROUGE
AND LISTERINE.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.351
- OKAY,
ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS,

01:57.385 --> 01:58.819
DID YOU MEET
CATHERINE DENEUVE?

01:58.852 --> 02:00.754
- OH, GOD, I LOVE HER.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.723
- NO, BUT WE DID MEET
THIS WONDERFUL COUPLE,

02:02.756 --> 02:04.592
UH, IN VERSAILLES.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.328
- OH, LET ME GUESS,
LOUIS AND MARIE?

02:07.361 --> 02:09.363
- NO, JEAN-PIERRE
AND YVETTE.

02:09.397 --> 02:12.466
- THEY HAVE THE MOST FABULOUS
MAISON IN THE 16TH.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.668
OH, TRY THE BRIE.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.404
- TASTES LIKE CUM.

02:16.437 --> 02:19.407
- OH, JEEZ!
- WHERE'S THE CHEDDAR?

02:19.440 --> 02:21.775
- HEY, MIND IF I JOIN YOU?
- NO.

02:21.809 --> 02:22.943
- HEY, SWEETIE.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.379
HI!

02:25.413 --> 02:28.649
OH-HO-HO, GOD, HE GETS BIGGER
EVERY TIME I SEE HIM.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.651
- IT'S ALL THAT DELICIOUS
FRENCH BABY FOOD

02:30.684 --> 02:33.254
GUILLAUME MAKES HIM.

02:34.955 --> 02:39.627
- SO, THIS, UH, ARRANGEMENT'S
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

02:39.660 --> 02:43.497
- YEAH, A LOT BETTER
THAN I THOUGHT.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.199
[baby cooing]

02:45.233 --> 02:48.836
- HONEY, EVEN IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO LISTEN TO ME AS...

02:48.869 --> 02:50.271
SOMEONE WHO CARES ABOUT YOU,

02:50.304 --> 02:52.906
I WISH YOU'D AT LEAST
TAKE MY LEGAL ADVICE.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.642
- ACTUALLY,

02:54.675 --> 02:58.812
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
A WEEK FROM TODAY.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.681
- WHAT'D HE DO?
KNOCK YOU UP?

03:00.714 --> 03:03.251
- NO, HIS DEPORTATION LETTER
CAME YESTERDAY.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.552
SO WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW.

03:04.585 --> 03:08.422
MAYBE MICHAEL
CAN FILM THE CEREMONY.

03:11.725 --> 03:12.826
I MEAN,
IT'S GOT TO LOOK REAL,

03:12.860 --> 03:15.195
IN CASE THERE'S
AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING.

03:19.267 --> 03:22.403
[baby cooing]

03:22.436 --> 03:23.737
- I AM FREAKING OUT.
- WHY?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.773
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO BE THE MAID OF HONOR?

03:25.806 --> 03:27.007
- YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.410
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH
WITH IT NEXT WEEK.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.579
- IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
REALLY GETTING MARRIED.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.447
IT'S JUST SO HE CAN
STAY IN THE COUNTRY.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.715
- YEAH,
WHAT IF HE NEVER LEAVES?

03:34.748 --> 03:36.850
WHAT IF HE BECOMES
A PERMANENT FIXTURE?

03:36.884 --> 03:40.688
- WHAT IF MY AUNT HAD BALLS?
SHE'D BE MY UNCLE.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.323
- NOW IT'S TOO LATE.
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.725
AND THERE'S NOT A GOD DAMN THING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

03:44.758 --> 03:48.829
SHOTGUN.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.598
- CAN'T WE LEAVE THAT
FOR MAGDALENA?

03:50.631 --> 03:52.032
THAT IS WHY WE PAY HER.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.468
YOU KNOW ME. I CAN'T SLEEP
UNTIL EVERYTHING'S PUT AWAY.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.370
- YOU'RE SO ANAL.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.606
- LUCKY FOR YOU.
- HMM.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.474
HEY.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.910
- WHOA! MMM, AHH!

04:02.943 --> 04:04.612
CAREFUL, CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.380
GEEZ, WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

04:06.414 --> 04:08.916
- WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE
I THANKED YOU PROPERLY

04:08.949 --> 04:11.018
FOR SHOWING ME
THE BEST TIME OF MY LIFE.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.820
- WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE
I THANKED YOU EITHER

04:12.853 --> 04:14.688
FOR LETTING ME SHOW YOU.

04:14.722 --> 04:15.623
COULD YOU BELIEVE
TED SNORING?

04:15.656 --> 04:18.726
- I THOUGHT HE WAS
BUILDING A LOG CABIN.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.793
THOSE GUYS HAVE NO IDEA

04:19.827 --> 04:22.396
THAT THERE IS A WORLD
OUTSIDE OF LIBERTY AVENUE.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.765
- WELL, YOU DIDN'T EITHER
UNTIL LAST WEEK.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.300
THIS CAB IS GREAT.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.100
I'M GOING TO ORDER
A CASE OF THIS

04:27.134 --> 04:28.469
AND SERVE IT
FOR SENATOR BAXTER.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.770
- DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD'VE INVITED THEM?

04:29.803 --> 04:30.638
- WHO?

04:30.671 --> 04:33.341
- MY MOM AND UNCLE VIC,
AND THE GUYS.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.375
- I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.576
- I THOUGHT YOU
DIDN'T WANT ME TO.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.845
- I SAID IT'D BE FINE, AS LONG
AS BRIAN BEHAVES HIMSELF.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.880
- OH, YOU KNOW,
POLITICAL FUNDRAISERS,

04:39.913 --> 04:42.983
I-I JUST DON'T
THINK IT'S THEIR THING.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.018
- SENATOR BAXTER'S
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF GAY ISSUES.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.820
I WOULD THINK
THAT'S EVERYBODY'S THING.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.021
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T--

04:48.055 --> 04:49.623
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
IF THEY'D BE COMFORTABLE

04:49.657 --> 04:52.993
AROUND OUR OTHER FRIENDS
AND A--A STATE SENATOR.

04:53.026 --> 04:57.698
- THEN YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.404
- EVERY CLUB IS ALLOWED TO MEET
EXCEPT OURS.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.972
IT'S NOT FAIR.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.073
- WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD,
DAPH.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.108
NOBODY GIVES A SHIT
ABOUT A GAY-STRAIGHT ALLIANCE.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.778
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
LOOK HOW MANY PEOPLE CAME.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.714
- WHAT, EIGHT?
AND TWO LEFT. I COUNTED.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.983
BESIDES, THEY ONLY CAME
'CAUSE WE HANDED OUT CONDOMS.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.926
- STUPID FAGGOT!
[laughing]

05:27.127 --> 05:28.829
YOU LIKE THAT, FAG?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.931
STICK THAT IN YOUR ASS, FAG.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.433
- AH!
[laughter]

05:32.466 --> 05:33.834
- FUCKER.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.704
- SERVES YOU RIGHT, HOMO.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.106
- [kicks locker]

05:39.139 --> 05:40.874
- BURN, FAG.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.143
- CAN YOU BELIEVE
HOW HE WAS CARRYING ON?

05:43.176 --> 05:47.481
- "SUR LA SEINE."
I NEARLY CHOKED ON MY PATE.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.450
- HE'S JUST DAZZLED.

05:49.483 --> 05:53.454
GIVE HIM A COUPLE OF DAYS
BACK AT "LE GRAND Q MART,"

05:53.487 --> 05:54.955
HE'LL COME DOWN TO EARTH.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.123
- I DON'T KNOW.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.525
EVER SINCE
HE'S BEEN WITH DAVID,

05:57.558 --> 05:59.727
IT'S LIKE HE'S GOT
THIS WHOLE NEW LIFE.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.796
- PLEASE, HE WAS, LIKE,
MY ROOMMATE FOR TWO YEARS.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.765
NOW I NEVER EVEN SEE HIM.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.134
- WE HAVE TO BEG HIM
TO COME OUT TO THE BARS.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.902
- HE WON'T FUCKING
RETURN MY CALLS.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.939
- OH, MY GOD.
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

06:11.972 --> 06:13.874
- OHH...

06:13.907 --> 06:15.776
- WHO WOULD DRIVE
A GOLD MIATA?

06:15.809 --> 06:18.045
- WITH THE TOP DOWN.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.647
- IN WINTER.
[laughs]

06:19.680 --> 06:22.416
- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

06:22.450 --> 06:24.752
- OH, THIS IS YOURS?
- [laughs]

06:24.785 --> 06:26.587
- DAVID GOT IT FOR ME.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.021
- HE--HE BOUGHT YOU
A FUCKING CAR?

06:28.055 --> 06:31.024
- CHECK OUT THE PLATES.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.963
- CAPTAIN ASTRO.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.731
THAT'S CUTE.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.567
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE COLOR?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.802
I WAS WORRIED THAT THE GOLD
MIGHT BE A TAD SHOWY.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.103
- OH, YOU WOULDN'T
WANT THAT.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.839
- AW...

06:45.873 --> 06:48.776
- YOU KNOW,
I CALLED YOU THIS MORNING.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.811
BUT, UH, YOU DIDN'T
CALL ME BACK.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.012
- WELL, I'VE BEEN
REALLY BUSY...

06:52.045 --> 06:54.982
- WANNA GO
TO THE GYM WITH US?

06:55.015 --> 06:58.786
- I CAN'T, I'M MEETING DAVID
AT OUR SPORTS CLUB.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.621
- WELL, WHAT'RE YOU
DOING TONIGHT?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.055
- HOW ABOUT COMING OUT
TO WOODY'S WITH US?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.791
- [sighs]
SORRY, NO CAN DO.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.092
WE HAVE RESERVATIONS
AT PAPPAGANO

07:05.125 --> 07:06.760
WITH BOBO AND MELISANDE.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.228
[both chuckle]

07:08.261 --> 07:10.197
- BOBO AND MELISANDE?

07:10.230 --> 07:12.232
- SOUNDS LIKE
A COUPLE OF DRAG QUEENS.

07:12.265 --> 07:16.236
- BOBO IS A BROKER. WE HAVE
OUR INVESTMENTS WITH HIM.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.805
[cell phone rings]

07:17.838 --> 07:20.874
- "OUR."

07:20.908 --> 07:22.876
- HI, HONEY.

07:22.910 --> 07:23.877
IT'S...

07:23.911 --> 07:26.246
- DAVID.
- DAVID. YEAH.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.482
- YEAH, DON'T WORRY.
I-I JUST PICKED THEM UP.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.117
AND I ALREADY
SPOKE TO THE CATERER.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.552
- HAVING A PARTY?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.721
- BYE. IT'S JUST...

07:33.754 --> 07:37.491
IT'S JUST A COUPLE
OF DAVID'S FRIENDS FOR DINNER.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.866
WELL, UM, I-I BETTER GET GOING.
[chuckles]

07:48.035 --> 07:49.703
SEE YOU!

07:49.737 --> 07:51.572
- TA-TA.
- BYE.

07:51.605 --> 07:54.542
- CIAO.

07:59.079 --> 08:03.083
- SO...WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:06.053 --> 08:07.821
- IT'S LIKE A MOVIE.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.590
A HORROR MOVIE.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.525
- GUILLAUME STILL
HAS TO FIT IT FOR ME.

08:11.559 --> 08:12.826
HE'S GREAT
WITH A NEEDLE AND THREAD.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.227
- IS THERE ANYTHING
HE CAN'T DO?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.063
- CHARM MY FRIENDS.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.733
- YOU KNOW, I-I DIDN'T
KNOW HE WAS TRYING.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.702
OH, WELL, IF IT ISN'T
COCO CHANEL.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.136
- COMPANY.
AREN'T WE LUCKY.

08:23.170 --> 08:27.140
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.842
- WELL...

08:28.876 --> 08:32.613
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
A LOT OF WORK, BUT...

08:32.646 --> 08:34.882
YOU WILL BE A VISION
BY THE TIME I'M THROUGH.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.149
- THANKS, GUI.
[baby crying]

08:36.183 --> 08:37.284
- I'LL GET HIM.
- THERE'S GUS.

08:37.317 --> 08:41.288
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S USED TO ME.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.026
- [scoffs]

08:46.059 --> 08:47.895
SO, WHAT IS THE GROOM
GOING TO BE WEARING?

08:47.928 --> 08:50.564
- A VERY CONSERVATIVE,
VERY TRADITIONAL BLACK TUX.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.900
WE CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.
IT HAS TO LOOK REAL.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.768
- [scoffs]
THIS IS A FUCKING FARCE.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.169
- HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LOSE YOUR TEMPER.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.672
- WHY NOT?
YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.174
- WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE MYSELF IN ONE OF THESE.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.977
ALTHOUGH NOW AND THEN,
I MUST ADMIT

09:04.011 --> 09:06.279
I OFTEN DREAMED
OF BEING A BRIDE.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.882
IT'S TRUE.

09:08.916 --> 09:12.352
I SUPPOSE EVEN DYKES
CAN'T ESCAPE THAT FANTASY.

09:12.385 --> 09:17.357
- [sighs] ONLY YOU'RE
MARRYING THE WRONG PERSON.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.927
- YOU NEVER ASKED ME.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.795
- I MEAN MELANIE.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.030
- YEAH, LAST TIME I CHECKED,

09:23.063 --> 09:26.366
WE LIVED IN PITTSBURGH
AND NOT VERMONT.

09:26.399 --> 09:30.070
AND ANYWAY, IT'S TOO LATE.
MEL AND I ARE FINISHED.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.673
- SHE DOESN'T THINK SO.

09:32.706 --> 09:36.243
IN FACT, ALL SHE
THINKS ABOUT IS YOU.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.212
SHE BLAMES HERSELF,
FOR EVERYTHING.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.683
- WELL, SHE'S WRONG.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.317
BECAUSE IT'S ME.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.720
'CAUSE I PUSHED HER AWAY.

09:46.754 --> 09:51.759
WHY WOULD YOU PUSH AWAY
SOMEONE YOU LOVE?

09:51.792 --> 09:54.762
- SORRY FOR TAKING SO LONG.

09:54.795 --> 09:58.832
HE WAS BEING VERY FUSSY.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.836
ALORS,
SHALL WE START ON THE GOWN?

10:02.870 --> 10:06.173
PARDON.

10:06.206 --> 10:10.143
OKAY,
I JUST WANT TO PIN HERE.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.382
- EVERYTHING WAS DESTROYED.
MY DRAWINGS, MY BOOKS...

10:15.415 --> 10:18.351
- YOU KNOW WHO DID IT?
- I CAN GUESS. CHRIS HOBBS.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.387
- I SAY WE GO
AND BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.956
- HEY, WE'RE TRYING TO BE
CONSTRUCTIVE HERE.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.157
- I THOUGHT I WAS.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.726
- DID YOU
TELL THE PRINCIPAL?

10:25.759 --> 10:27.728
- HE DOESN'T CARE.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.196
IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF THIS GROUP.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.230
- WHAT GROUP?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.732
- JUSTIN AND DAPHNE

10:31.765 --> 10:33.233
STARTED THE GAY-STRAIGHT
STUDENT ALLIANCE.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.835
- YEAH,
BUT THEY SHUT US DOWN.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.436
SAID WE DIDN'T GO THROUGH
THE PROPER CHANNELS.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.905
- EVEN IF YOU HAD,

10:37.938 --> 10:39.172
IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T
HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.742
- DO YOU HAVE TO PISS
ON THE KID'S IDEALISM?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.410
- HE MIGHT AS WELL
KNOW THE TRUTH.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.979
- WE JUST WANTED
A PLACE TO TALK.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.380
WE COULDN'T EVEN HAVE THAT.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.382
- WELL,
CONSIDERING WHAT'S HAPPENED,

10:49.416 --> 10:51.685
MAYBE IT'S BEST
THAT YOU DON'T...

10:51.719 --> 10:53.053
DRAW ATTENTION
TO YOURSELF.

10:53.086 --> 10:56.123
- YOU WANT ME TO HIDE?
- I WANT YOU TO BE SAFE.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.758
- SO I SHOULD JUST GIVE IN.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.727
LET THEM INTIMIDATE ME
MY ENTIRE LIFE?

10:59.760 --> 11:02.162
- YOU STICK UP FOR YOURSELF,
SUNSHINE.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.397
AND YOU STAND BESIDE HIM.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.200
- DEBBIE, WOULD YOU PLEASE
STAY OUT OF THIS?

11:07.234 --> 11:08.168
- I FORGOT.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.838
HE JUST EATS, SLEEPS,
AND JERKS OFF HERE.

11:10.871 --> 11:14.174
I'LL KEEP
MY BIG MOUTH SHUT.

11:14.207 --> 11:18.746
- MOM, THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.815
OR EVEN WHAT HAPPENED
AT SCHOOL.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.284
THIS IS ABOUT
SPEAKING OUT.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.452
DEMANDING TO BE HEARD,

11:25.485 --> 11:27.287
WHETHER PEOPLE
WANT TO HEAR YOU OR NOT.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.289
- WHERE'D YOU
LEARN ALL THAT?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.759
- IT'S WHAT
YOU AND DAD TAUGHT ME.

11:31.792 --> 11:32.960
- WE DID?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.862
- WELL, HE SURE AS HELL
DIDN'T LEARN IT

11:34.895 --> 11:38.098
AT THE ST. JAMES ACADEMY.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.513
- SO HOW WAS DINNER
WITH, UH...

11:53.546 --> 11:54.915
BOBO AND...

11:54.948 --> 11:57.517
MELISAND?
- MELISANDE.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.220
MELISANDE'S A HOOT, AND BOBO'S
LIKE, THE SMARTEST PERSON

12:00.253 --> 12:01.288
I HAVE EVER MET.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.255
YOU--YOU'D LOVE THEM.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.357
- UH-HUH.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.360
- UM, COULD YOU NOT
LEAN ON THAT?

12:07.394 --> 12:10.798
I JUST GOT DONE
POLISHING IT.

12:10.831 --> 12:15.502
- SORRY.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.037
SO, WHY HAVEN'T YOU
INTRODUCED

12:17.070 --> 12:19.973
ANY OF YOUR
NEW BEST FRIENDS

12:20.007 --> 12:23.243
TO ANY OF YOUR
OLD BEST FRIENDS?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.245
- WELL, WHO'S HAD THE TIME?

12:25.278 --> 12:27.447
YOU KNOW,
WE JUST GOT BACK FROM PARIS.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.983
- YOU WENT TO PARIS?
GOD, I HADN'T HEARD.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.151
- FUCK OFF.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.519
- YEAH,
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE THAT.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.154
- WHAT?

12:34.187 --> 12:36.323
- NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT
THIS FABULOUS NEW LIFE...

12:36.356 --> 12:38.525
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.995
- IS IT?

12:42.029 --> 12:47.000
YOU MISSED A SPOT.

12:47.034 --> 12:50.370
HOW LONG HAVE I KNOWN YOU?
LIKE, FOREVER?

12:53.306 --> 12:55.876
I DON'T THINK
IT'S BULLSHIT.

12:55.909 --> 13:01.014
- COULD YOU MOVE, PLEASE?

13:01.048 --> 13:04.584
- THE TRIP, AND THE CLOTHES,
AND THE CAR.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.286
THEY'RE BORING.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.388
YOU'RE BORING.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.023
- BORING?

13:10.057 --> 13:11.158
WELL, I HAPPEN TO THINK

13:11.191 --> 13:13.193
I'VE BECOME A VERY
INTERESTING PERSON.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.395
- YOU'VE BECOME
A FUCKING LITTLE SNOT.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.396
- WHY?
'CAUSE I FINALLY HAVE A LIFE?

13:16.429 --> 13:19.867
- WHOSE LIFE? YOURS?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.568
OR HIS?

13:21.601 --> 13:23.503
[scoffs]

13:30.477 --> 13:32.846
[car door opens, closes]

13:32.880 --> 13:34.915
[engine starts]

13:34.948 --> 13:38.051
- JUSTIN TELLS ME THAT
OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS

13:38.085 --> 13:43.056
HE'S BEEN PHYSICALLY ATTACKED,
HARASSED, CALLED NAMES,

13:43.090 --> 13:45.592
AND NOTHING
HAS BEEN DONE TO STOP IT.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.960
- WELL, MRS. TAYLOR,

13:46.994 --> 13:48.495
I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT HAD I KNOWN ABOUT IT,

13:48.528 --> 13:51.198
I WOULD NEVER HAVE TOLERATED
SUCH BEHAVIOR.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.601
- WELL, HE ALSO SAID
THAT HE TRIED TO START A CLUB

13:54.634 --> 13:56.569
FOR GAY AND STRAIGHT
STUDENTS,

13:56.603 --> 14:01.008
AND YOU REFUSED
TO ALLOW THEM TO MEET.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.210
- AS ONE OF THE TEACHERS
ALREADY EXPLAINED TO JUSTIN,

14:03.243 --> 14:05.245
HE--HE DIDN'T GO THROUGH
THE PROPER CHANNELS.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.380
- AND WHAT ARE
THE PROPER CHANNELS?

14:07.414 --> 14:08.949
- WELL, FIRST HE WOULD
HAVE TO GET APPROVAL

14:08.982 --> 14:11.484
FROM THE SCHOOL BOARD,
OF WHICH I AM THE HEAD.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.987
AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE TO SEEK
APPROVAL FOR A MEETING ROOM,

14:14.021 --> 14:17.891
FIND A FACULTY ADVISOR, NONE
OF WHICH JUSTIN BOTHERED TO DO.

14:17.925 --> 14:22.195
- WELL, I'M SURE HE WOULD'VE
BOTHERED, HAD HE KNOWN.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.198
SO, WHERE ARE THE FORMS?

14:25.232 --> 14:27.000
WE CAN FILL
THEM OUT RIGHT NOW.

14:27.034 --> 14:31.471
- MRS. TAYLOR, AS YOU KNOW,
ST. JAMES IS A PRIVATE ACADEMY.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.640
WE ARE NOT REQUIRED
TO MAKE ALLOWANCES

14:33.673 --> 14:35.442
FOR EVERYONE
AND EVERYTHING.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.177
THAT'S WHY PARENTS SEND
THEIR CHILDREN TO THIS SCHOOL,

14:37.210 --> 14:38.178
FOR THE SPECIAL ENVIRONMENT.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.613
AND FOR THE SUPERIOR
EDUCATION,

14:40.647 --> 14:43.316
WHICH JUSTIN IS GETTING,
WHEN HE PUTS HIS MIND TO IT.

14:43.350 --> 14:47.454
- WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH
HAVING A GAY-STRAIGHT ALLIANCE?

14:47.487 --> 14:50.223
- ALL RIGHT,
SUPPOSE I GAVE YOU PERMISSION

14:50.257 --> 14:52.092
TO ORGANIZE YOUR CLUB.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.560
AND THEN ANOTHER STUDENT
CAME TO ME

14:53.593 --> 14:56.930
AND ASKED TO START A CLUB
FOR, SAY, WHITE SUPREMACISTS.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.165
SHOULD I ALLOW THAT TOO?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.400
- EXCUSE ME, DR. PERKINS,

15:00.433 --> 15:03.436
BUT I HAPPEN TO FIND THAT
ANALOGY EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.572
- SOME OF OUR PARENTS

15:05.605 --> 15:08.275
WOULD BE HARD-PRESSED
TO SEE THE DISTINCTION.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.710
- WELL, I'M HARD-PRESSED
TO SEE THE SIMILARITY.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.545
- NOT EVERYONE
IS AS ACCEPTING

15:12.579 --> 15:15.282
OF YOUR SON'S
SEXUAL PREFERENCE AS YOU ARE.

15:15.315 --> 15:19.286
- IT'S NOT A PREFERENCE.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.155
- I WAS THAT WAY
AT FIRST TOO.

15:22.189 --> 15:25.425
WHICH IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT THEY LEARN.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.027
- MRS. TAYLOR,
THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT

15:27.060 --> 15:28.962
LESSONS TO BE TAUGHT HERE.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.930
- THAN TOLERANCE?

15:36.469 --> 15:38.105
- ANYONE SEEN A CERTAIN
HOT LITTLE ITEM

15:38.138 --> 15:39.339
IN OUR LOCAL GAY RAG?

15:39.372 --> 15:40.707
- IS MY AD STILL RUNNING?

15:40.740 --> 15:42.342
- "IF YOU'VE GOT IT,
I'LL SIT ON IT"? IS THAT YOU?

15:42.375 --> 15:44.611
- [laughs]
NO.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.513
- I MEAN...

15:46.546 --> 15:47.514
THIS.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.715
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK

15:48.748 --> 15:49.716
I'VE EVER OPENED THIS PAPER
FROM THE FRONT.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.185
"A FUNDRAISER
FOR STATE SENATOR DIANE BAXTER

15:52.219 --> 15:53.220
"WILL BE HELD AT THE HOME

15:53.253 --> 15:57.457
OF DR. DAVID CAMERON
AND MR. MICHAEL NOVOTNY."

15:57.490 --> 15:59.226
- WHAT? LET ME SEE THAT.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.361
- HEY,
CAN WE HAVE OUR FOOD?

16:01.394 --> 16:02.695
- EAT THE BREAD.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.232
OH, MY GOD!

16:05.265 --> 16:08.568
OH, MY BABY'S
IN HIGH SOCIETY.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.340
- OH, AND HERE'S THE HOSTESS
WITH THE MOSTESS.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.208
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

16:15.242 --> 16:17.344
- ENTERTAINING A SENATOR.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.012
- GOD, YOU'RE
A SOCIETY LADY NOW, MIKEY.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.714
- I HOPE YOU DON'T SHOW HER
THOSE SLIDES FROM PARIS.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.017
- THIS IS JUST A LITTLE THING
THAT DAVID'S THROWING.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.419
I THINK HE GAVE THE SENATOR AN
ADJUSTMENT ONCE, OR SOMETHING.

16:26.453 --> 16:27.754
- COULD WE PLEASE
HAVE OUR FOOD?

16:27.787 --> 16:31.224
- IT'S SALAD, HON.
IT'S NOT GOING TO GET COLD.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.093
[chuckles]

16:33.126 --> 16:34.327
OH, SHIT!

16:34.361 --> 16:35.362
WHAT DO YOU WEAR
TO MEET A SENATOR?

16:35.395 --> 16:36.429
- OH, I THINK
I'M GOING TO WEAR

16:36.463 --> 16:39.499
MY, UM--MY ORANGE SUIT,
AND MY NEW LIME GREEN TIE.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.235
- OH, UNDERSTATED, YEAH.
THAT'S DEFINITELY THE WAY TO GO.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.237
HOW ABOUT YOU, BRIAN?

16:44.271 --> 16:46.239
- A LITTLE ARMANI?
ZEGNA? PRADA?

16:46.273 --> 16:47.674
- NADA.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.209
I WASN'T INVITED.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.511
- OF COURSE YOU'RE INVITED.
WE'RE ALL INVITED.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.779
RIGHT, HONEY?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.647
- WELL, IT'S GOING TO
BE REALLY STUFFY.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.516
YOU KNOW, NO FUN AT ALL.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.650
AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A CONTRIBUTION.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.487
- SO? I MEAN, HOW OFTEN
DO YOU GET TO MEET A SENATOR?

17:00.520 --> 17:04.191
- WELL, YOU HAVE TO WORK.
- I'LL TAKE IT OFF.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.293
- LOOK, THIS JUST
ISN'T YOUR THING, OKAY?

17:06.326 --> 17:10.730
SO JUST DROP IT.

17:10.763 --> 17:15.268
NOW, CAN I PLEASE
GET THE TURKEY MEATLOAF TO GO?

17:15.302 --> 17:18.771
- OKAY, SWEETIE.

17:18.805 --> 17:22.342
UH, JUST LET ME SERVE
THIS MAN HIS DINNER.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.478
- I GOTTA GO
TO THE WASHROOM.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.152
- SAY, TED,
AS MY ACCOUNTANT,

17:32.185 --> 17:33.586
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT INCREASING

17:33.620 --> 17:38.191
MY POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS?

17:40.493 --> 17:43.463
[party chatter]

17:50.470 --> 17:52.172
- [chuckles]

17:52.205 --> 17:54.107
AND I DO HAVE TO THANK YOU
AGAIN, DAVID,

17:54.141 --> 17:56.776
FOR OPENING UP
YOUR BEAUTIFUL HOME TO US.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.445
- WELL, THANK YOU, SENATOR,

17:58.478 --> 18:00.713
FOR YOUR ONGOING COMMITMENT
TO PRO-GAY LEGISLATION.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.483
- OH, BELIEVE ME, IF I HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT,

18:03.516 --> 18:05.218
AND I INTEND TO,

18:05.252 --> 18:06.386
YOU AND MICHAEL
WILL BE CELEBRATING

18:06.419 --> 18:09.189
YOUR WEDDING RECEPTION
RIGHT HERE.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.459
- LET'S DRINK TO THAT.
- MMM!

18:12.492 --> 18:15.462
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I SHOULD, UM...

18:15.495 --> 18:17.197
DO WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO
AT THESE AFFAIRS

18:17.230 --> 18:19.232
AND DRUM UP SOME DONATIONS.

18:19.266 --> 18:23.370
- GOOD LUCK.
- THANK YOU.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.737
- THE LAST PARTY I WAS AT,

18:24.771 --> 18:26.906
WE WATCHED I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

18:26.939 --> 18:28.608
AND ATE BEER AND NACHOS.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.511
- NOW YOU'RE DRINKING CHAMPAGNE,
EATING CAVIAR TARTS,

18:31.544 --> 18:34.347
AND ENTERTAINING A SENATOR.

18:34.381 --> 18:37.384
- I HOPE WE'RE NOT TOO LATE.
I'D HATE TO MISS THE CRUDITES.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.620
- OH, SHIT.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.423
- JESUS.
THIS LOOKS LIKE A WAKE.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.226
WHO DIED?

18:46.259 --> 18:47.394
- HEY, NOVOTNY!

18:47.427 --> 18:50.663
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:50.697 --> 18:51.664
- WELL, WE WOULDN'T HAVE
MISSED YOUR PARTY

18:51.698 --> 18:52.799
FOR THE WORLD, SWEETHEART.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.667
- YEAH, WE FIGURE OUR
INVITATION GOT LOST IN THE MAIL.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.637
- DAMN THE POSTAL SERVICE.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.771
I'M GOING TO
WRITE MY SENATOR.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.773
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
SHE'S HERE.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.775
- THIS IS A PRIVATE BENEFIT.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.278
YOU CAN'T JUST BREAK IN.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.479
- "BREAK IN"?

19:06.513 --> 19:08.681
WE'RE FAMILY, NOT BANDITS.

19:08.715 --> 19:09.749
- HERE'S A LITTLE CHECK,
DOC.

19:09.782 --> 19:13.453
I THINK IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH
TO COVER ALL OF US.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.755
- NICE TIE, MIKEY.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.191
'SCUSE ME.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.392
- CARE TO TRY A TART?

19:19.426 --> 19:22.295
- COCKTAIL?
- OR TWO OR THREE.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.900
- I AM SO SORRY, DAVID.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.537
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY
WOULD SHOW UP UNINVITED.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.239
- I DON'T THINK SENATOR BAXTER
IS GOING TO MIND

19:32.272 --> 19:35.675
WHEN SHE SEES THE SIZE
OF THAT CONTRIBUTION.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.945
- THIS MUSIC SUCKS DICK.

19:38.978 --> 19:42.549
- I BELIEVE
IT'S JAZZ FUSION.

19:42.582 --> 19:47.554
- YEAH, IN PHYSICS, A FUSION
IS SUPPOSED TO CAUSE A BLAST.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.856
LIKE...

19:49.889 --> 19:50.857
THIS!

19:50.890 --> 19:53.860

19:53.893 --> 19:55.962
YOU WANT TO DANCE?

19:55.995 --> 19:58.798
- I DON'T DANCE.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.268
- YOU DO NOW.

20:01.301 --> 20:08.841

20:08.875 --> 20:10.777
- THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.581
- SENATOR BAXTER?

20:14.614 --> 20:16.449
- YES, I AM.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.784
- OH, I SAW YOU IN OUT.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.720
I'M DEBBIE NOVOTNY.
- HELLO.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.855
- AND THIS IS MY BROTHER VIC.
- HOW DO YOU DO?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.857
- HELLO.
- I'M MICHAEL'S MOTHER.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.559
- OH.

20:26.593 --> 20:27.994
- YOU KNOW, OUR HOST.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.363
- YES, AND A VERY CHARMING
YOUNG MAN HE IS.

20:30.397 --> 20:34.334
- WE USED TO THINK SO.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.902
- OH, MY GOD,
THEY'VE CORNERED THE SENATOR.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.737
WE HAVE TO SAVE HER.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.005
- SHE'S A POLITICIAN,
MICHAEL.

20:39.038 --> 20:44.010
SHE CAN TALK HER WAY
OUT OF ANYTHING.

20:49.782 --> 20:53.386
- HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

20:53.420 --> 20:56.723
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

20:56.756 --> 21:00.893
CARE TO DANCE?

21:00.927 --> 21:02.729
- I'M NOT INTO LEATHER.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.764
- HEY, YOU KNOW,
NEITHER WAS I.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.333
THEN I RAN INTO THIS
OLD SCHOOL FRIEND

21:06.366 --> 21:07.500
WHO SHACKLED ME
IN HIS DUNGEON

21:07.534 --> 21:10.570
AND MADE ME HIS SUCK-PIG.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.752
- BLACK AND BLUE, IT'S...

21:25.785 --> 21:27.620
IT'S FINE FOR BRUISES, BOYS,

21:27.654 --> 21:30.457
BUT WHEN YOU COME TO A PARTY,
YOU NEED A LITTLE COLOR.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.392
NOW, YOU...

21:32.425 --> 21:33.726
OH, MY LORD,
W-WHO DRESSED YOU, HONEY?

21:33.760 --> 21:35.061
MORTICIA ADDAMS?

21:35.094 --> 21:36.529
HERE, TURN AROUND.
[clears throat]

21:36.563 --> 21:39.799
SEE, NOW YOU HAVE
A FABULOUS BUBBLE-BUTT.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.868
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO
DO YOU ANY GOOD

21:41.901 --> 21:43.069
IF YOU DON'T SHOW IT OFF.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.371
YOU TOO.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.005
JACKETS OFF,
LET'S SEE THOSE BODS.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.006
COME ON.

21:47.039 --> 21:52.011
COME ON, CHOP, CHOP.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.080
THIS LADY IS A TRAMP,

21:54.113 --> 21:59.486
AND TONIGHT JACK'S NOT
THE ONLY ONE GETTING LUCKY.

21:59.519 --> 22:02.822
- COME ON.

22:02.855 --> 22:05.024
[baby fussing]
OH, MAN. ALL RIGHT.

OHH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT,

- HI, IT'S ME.
I KNOW IT'S LATE.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.111
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

22:25.144 --> 22:27.780
- IT'S GUS.
HE'S IN ONE OF HIS MOODS.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.616
- OH.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.518
I REMEMBER HIS MOODS.

22:31.551 --> 22:35.154
- LOOK, YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE MAGIC TOUCH.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.724
WOULD YOU MIND?

22:37.757 --> 22:40.026
- OVER THE PHONE?

22:40.059 --> 22:43.863
- I'M DESPERATE.
I'LL TRY ANYTHING.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.865
HERE WE GO.

* THE MOMENT I WAKE UP

22:55.575 --> 23:00.046

MY MAKEUP *

23:00.079 --> 23:04.116

FOR YOU *

23:32.945 --> 23:35.882
DID THAT WORK?

23:35.915 --> 23:38.785
- LIKE A CHARM.

23:38.818 --> 23:42.489
HE'S STILL THE ONLY ONE
WHO APPRECIATES YOUR SINGING.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.157
- WHAT?
I HAVE A LOVELY VOICE.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.627
- YOU CAN BARELY
CARRY A TUNE. [laughs]

23:47.660 --> 23:49.061
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.932
- YEAH, IT IS.
- YEAH, IT IS.

23:52.965 --> 23:57.937
- LISTEN,
THANKS FOR HELPING.

- DON'T WORRY, I'M JUST GIVING
HIM A TOUR OF YOUR LOVELY HOME.

25:16.616 --> 25:20.887
- DAVID, I'M SO SORRY.
- WHY?

25:20.920 --> 25:23.890
I DON'T HEAR ANYONE
COMPLAINING.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.892
- I SAY KICK THOSE
REPUBLICANS RIGHT IN THE BALLS.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.827
ONLY THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY.
[both laugh]

25:27.860 --> 25:32.732
- OH, MY GOD!

25:32.765 --> 25:36.636
MA, COULD YOU, UM,
STOP MONOPOLIZING THE SENATOR?

25:36.669 --> 25:39.005
- I'M SORRY, DIANE.
- "DIANE"?

25:39.038 --> 25:43.209
- MICHAEL, YOUR MOTHER
IS A REMARKABLE WOMAN.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.646
YOU KNOW, DAVID,
I ATTEND A LOT OF FUNDRAISERS.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.214
AND I MEAN,
EVERYBODY MEANS WELL,

25:48.247 --> 25:50.617
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, THEY'RE
USUALLY VERY BORING THINGS.

25:50.650 --> 25:54.286
NOT THIS ONE.
I'M HAVING A BALL.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.088
- MA, UM, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

25:56.122 --> 25:57.657
- SURE, SWEETIE.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.160
- HEY, SUNSHINE, COME HERE.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.029
TELL DIANE
ABOUT THE CLUB YOU STARTED.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.164
THIS IS ONE
GOD DAMN BRAVE KID.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.165
I LOVE HIM.

- HI. I'M JUSTIN TAYLOR.
- HOW DO YOU DO?

26:11.370 --> 26:12.905
- UH, I STARTED A...

26:12.939 --> 26:14.040
- CARRY THAT
A LITTLE HIGHER.

SWEETIE, THAT'S IT.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.176
PROFESSIONAL COURTESY.

26:17.209 --> 26:20.212
- HOW DARE
YOU DO THIS TO ME?

26:20.246 --> 26:21.681
AND TO DAVID.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.851
- DO WHAT?
I WAS JUST TALKING TO DIANE.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.086
DO YOU KNOW
THAT SHE WORKED AS A WAITRESS?

26:27.119 --> 26:28.788
TO TAKE CARE OF HER FAMILY.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.690
- SHE WAS JUST BEING POLITE.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.625
- POLITE?

26:32.659 --> 26:34.126
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK
SHE WANTED TO SPEND

26:34.160 --> 26:36.362
HER ENTIRE EVENING
TALKING TO YOU?

26:36.395 --> 26:39.766
- WELL, IT'S NOT AS IF
I NAILED HER TO THE FLOOR.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.768
- I THINK
YOU SHOULD ALL LEAVE.

26:41.801 --> 26:45.237
- THIS PARTY WAS A STINKER
WHEN WE GOT HERE.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.372
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING US.

26:46.405 --> 26:50.342
- FOR EMBARRASSING
THE HELL OUT OF ME?

26:59.986 --> 27:02.388
- YOU KNOW,
I KNOW I'M HARD TO TAKE.

27:02.421 --> 27:05.091
SOMETIMES.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.995
HMM? MY JOKES,
AND MY APPEARANCE,

27:09.028 --> 27:12.732
AND MY ENTHUSIASM.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.367
AND I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES
YOU'RE ASHAMED OF ME.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.404
AND THAT'S OKAY,
'CAUSE I'M YOUR MOTHER,

27:18.437 --> 27:20.072
AND IT'S PART OF THE DEAL.

27:20.106 --> 27:24.143
BUT, MICHAEL...

27:24.176 --> 27:28.014
I NEVER THOUGHT
THE DAY WOULD COME

27:28.047 --> 27:30.182
THAT I WOULD
BE ASHAMED OF YOU.

HAVE ANY WHITE PEACHES?

OH, PITTSBURGH.

28:23.469 --> 28:26.405
[humming]

28:32.278 --> 28:34.346
- HE EVEN DOES THE SHOPPING.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.482
- LOOK WHO'S HERE, GUS,
YOUR SPERM DONOR.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.384
AND YOU THOUGHT
HE HAD A JOB.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.954
- IT'S CALLED "LUNCH BREAK."
- MM-HMM.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.089
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T
PUT THINGS IN YOUR MOUTH

28:43.122 --> 28:45.357
THAT AREN'T WASHED.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.827
- [scoffs]
YOU FRENCH, SO HYGIENIC.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.028
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

28:49.061 --> 28:52.765
- AS YOU WISH. OF COURSE,
YOU'RE USED TO LIVING AT RISK.

28:52.799 --> 28:55.501
- YEAH. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TAKING
QUITE A RISK YOURSELF.

28:55.534 --> 28:59.271
IN FACT, IF SOMEONE WANTED TO,
THEY COULD REPORT YOU.

28:59.305 --> 29:03.342
- YES.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.045
IT WOULD BE TROUBLE FOR ME.
I COULD BE SENT BACK TO FRANCE.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.314
BUT IT'D BE FAR WORSE
FOR LINDSAY.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.481
SHE COULD BE SENT TO JAIL,

29:09.515 --> 29:11.250
WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY
THE COTE D'AZUR.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.452
- YOU KNOW,
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.187
- OH, I TRIED STOPPING HER,
BELIEVE ME.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.388
BUT SHE WON'T HEAR OF IT.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.090
YOU KNOW
WHAT A BIG HEART SHE HAS.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.426
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

29:20.459 --> 29:22.128
- WELL, IS IT FOR DINNER
OR FOR YOU?

29:22.161 --> 29:23.996
- AH, HA-HA.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.431
- COME HERE, SONNY BOY.
- AH, NO, NO, NO.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.000
I HAVE TO GET HOME
TO START MY RATATOUILLE.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.936
- FUCK YOUR RATATOUILLE.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.805
GIVE ME MY KID, OR I'LL
SHOVE THAT ZUCCHINI UP YOUR ASS.

I KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT. HE SMELLS.

- WELL, I WISH I HAD A PICTURE
TO CAPTURE THIS RARE MOMENT.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.389
- DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

29:50.422 --> 29:54.193
- YOU KNOW,
ONCE LINDSAY AND I ARE MARRIED,

29:54.226 --> 29:55.828
WE'LL NEED YOU
TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.063
- WHY IS THAT?

29:57.096 --> 29:59.832
- WELL, WE'VE GOT TO THINK
ABOUT APPEARANCES.

29:59.866 --> 30:03.169
I'M EVEN THINKING
OF ADOPTING GUS.

30:03.202 --> 30:07.173
THAT WAY EVERYTHING
WOULD BE NICE AND LEGAL.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.310
- ALORS.
TU VIENS ICI, MON PETIT.

[chanting continues]

30:47.980 --> 30:49.982
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

30:52.985 --> 30:54.620
- WE'RE PROTESTING
ST. JAMES ACADEMY'S

30:54.653 --> 30:56.989
BIGOTED POLICY
ON STUDENT CLUBS.

30:57.023 --> 30:59.458
- TAYLOR, I HAVE HAD
JUST ABOUT ENOUGH OF THIS.

30:59.491 --> 31:02.428
- IT'S CALLED
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY, PAL.

31:02.461 --> 31:03.963
- THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.

31:03.996 --> 31:05.497
AND YOU'RE ALL
TRESPASSING.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.166
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

31:07.199 --> 31:10.202
- YOU MIGHT WANT
TO STICK AROUND FOR THIS.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.410
JUSTIN TAYLOR
TRIED TO ORGANIZE A CLUB

31:18.444 --> 31:20.412
TO PROMOTE TOLERANCE
AND UNDERSTANDING

31:20.446 --> 31:22.148
BETWEEN GAY
AND STRAIGHT STUDENTS.

31:22.181 --> 31:23.215
- HERE, HERE.
- YEAH!

31:23.249 --> 31:25.251
- HIS ATTEMPT WAS DENIED
ON THE BASIS

31:25.284 --> 31:28.587
THAT ST. JAMES ACADEMY
IS A PRIVATE INSTITUTION

31:28.620 --> 31:30.389
AND ISN'T REQUIRED
TO ACKNOWLEDGE

31:30.422 --> 31:32.091
THE VOICES
OF ALL ITS STUDENTS.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.626
WELL, IF PRIVATE SCHOOLS

31:34.660 --> 31:37.096
EXPECT TO RECEIVE
PUBLIC DOLLARS,

31:37.129 --> 31:39.565
THEN WE CAN EXPECT THEM
TO UPHOLD THE SAME VALUES

31:39.598 --> 31:41.533
OF FREEDOM AND CIVIL RIGHTS

31:41.567 --> 31:43.970
ON WHICH THIS COUNTRY
IS BASED.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.404
- GIVE 'EM HELL, DI.

31:45.437 --> 31:48.140
[cheers and applause]

32:17.769 --> 32:20.939
- I LOVE THAT PICTURE.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.210
- YEAH.

32:26.478 --> 32:29.448
DADA AND SONNY-BOY.

32:31.617 --> 32:35.387
AHH, ALL RIGHT,
SO I'M A SHITTY FATHER.

32:35.421 --> 32:38.757
ARE WE SURPRISED?

32:38.790 --> 32:41.960
I'M UPHOLDING
A FINE FAMILY TRADITION.

32:44.230 --> 32:48.334
- YOU'RE NOT A SHITTY FATHER.

32:48.367 --> 32:51.603
YOU LOVE GUS.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.340
- [clears throat]

32:54.373 --> 32:58.710
DIDN'T THINK I WOULD.
IT'S STRANGE.

32:58.744 --> 33:02.181
- KNOWING THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
YOU CARE ABOUT BESIDES YOURSELF?

33:02.214 --> 33:04.350
- [sighs]
- GIVE ME--

33:04.383 --> 33:07.619
- IT'S BAD ENOUGH
YOU SMOKE AT YOUR AGE.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.321
- "AT MY AGE"?

33:09.355 --> 33:11.257
- [clears throat]

33:11.290 --> 33:16.028
- BRIAN, I'M THE MOST MATURE
PERSON YOU KNOW.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.197
[grunts]

33:22.701 --> 33:24.303
THINK GUS
IS GOING TO SPEAK FRENCH

33:24.336 --> 33:27.606
BEFORE HE SPEAKS ENGLISH?

33:27.639 --> 33:30.342
- WHY DON'T YOU GO TO BED?

33:30.376 --> 33:32.644
I MEAN, LINDSAY
CAN'T RAISE HIM ON HER OWN.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.513
AND AS MUCH
AS YOU LOVE HIM,

33:34.546 --> 33:37.349
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE
A FULL-TIME PARENT.

33:37.383 --> 33:41.287
- YOU KNOW, IF I WANTED
THE NEWS, I'D WATCH CNN.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.655
- YOU CAN'T CONTROL
EVERYONE'S LIFE,

33:43.689 --> 33:45.424
EVEN THOUGH YOU'D LIKE TO.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.127
- [exhales]
OBVIOUSLY.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.097
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

34:00.639 --> 34:04.310
- BEING MEAN TO ME
HAS NEVER REALLY WORKED.

34:08.347 --> 34:11.183
YOU SHOULD TRY
ANOTHER TACTIC.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.551
[grunts]

34:17.189 --> 34:21.260
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:21.293 --> 34:25.464
- I'M KILLING YOU
WITH KINDNESS.

34:25.497 --> 34:28.834
IT'S PROVEN TO BE
A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE

34:28.867 --> 34:33.405
FOR ACHIEVING ONE'S GOALS.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.159
- DO YOU HAVE HIS TOYS?

34:53.192 --> 34:56.128
- THEY'RE IN THE BAG.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.202
- WHERE ARE MY KEYS?

35:03.235 --> 35:04.836
- PLEASE, PLEASE HURRY UP.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.172
THE APPOINTMENT'S
IN 20 MINUTES.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.306
- I KNOW WHEN
THE APPOINTMENT IS.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.674
OH, GOD, HERE THEY ARE.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.876
[doorbell rings]

35:13.245 --> 35:15.214
- OH, MERDE.

35:15.247 --> 35:17.216
IT'S ALL WE NEED. OKAY,
Y-YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF THEM.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.750
- ALL RIGHT, MOVE, MOVE.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.220
- D'ACCORD.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.355
- I--
- LOOK, WE'RE IN A HURRY.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.357
- I-I SWEAR I HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS BRINGING ME OVER HERE.

35:25.391 --> 35:26.492
- WE HAVE TO LEAVE.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.859
- HE SAID
YOU HAD AN ACCIDENT.

35:27.893 --> 35:30.496
- AN ACCIDENT?
- THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.398
- MAY WE SAVE THIS
FOR SOME OTHER TIME?

35:32.431 --> 35:33.465
WE'RE LATE.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.700
- ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE,
PIERRE?

35:34.733 --> 35:36.202
- TO GET
OUR MARRIAGE LICENSE.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.102
SO, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US--

35:37.135 --> 35:38.404
- WELL, THIS WILL
JUST TAKE A MINUTE.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.339
- NO, NO. WE REALLY MUST--

35:40.372 --> 35:42.241
- SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.

35:42.274 --> 35:43.342
- EXCUSE ME?
- SIT DOWN.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.477
- ALL RIGHT.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.647
- [sighs]

35:48.680 --> 35:50.449
- WHAT IS IT?

35:50.482 --> 35:51.883
- OKAY, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY MORE SHIT

35:51.917 --> 35:54.620
ABOUT "THIS IS MY FAULT."
"NO, THIS IS MY FAULT."

35:54.653 --> 35:57.389
"I'M TO BLAME."
"NO, I'M TO BLAME."

35:57.423 --> 35:58.924
"I'M SORRY."
"NO, I'M SORRY."

35:58.957 --> 36:00.926
- BUT IT REALLY IS MY FAULT.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.394
- NO, MEL,
IT WAS MY FAULT.

36:02.428 --> 36:03.395
ALL ALONG IT WAS--
- NO, NO, NO.

36:03.429 --> 36:04.230
IT WAS MY FAULT,
TRUST ME.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.464
I WORKED THIS ALL OUT
IN THERAPY.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.800
- AND SO DID I.
- I SAID SHUT UP.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.770
AND FUCK THERAPY.

36:14.373 --> 36:17.476
THIS IS THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.680
- WHAT'S THAT?

36:21.713 --> 36:24.550
- IT'S MY PARENTAL RIGHTS.

36:24.583 --> 36:29.288
I'VE SIGNED THEM
OVER TO YOU.

36:29.321 --> 36:31.590
- OH, MY GOD.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.758
BRIAN--

36:32.791 --> 36:33.959
- ARE YOU SURE?

36:33.992 --> 36:37.396
- WOULD I BE DOING THIS
IF I WASN'T?

36:37.429 --> 36:38.764
- BUT WHY?

36:38.797 --> 36:41.333
- WELL, MY SON DESERVES
TWO PARENTS

36:41.367 --> 36:44.436
WHO'LL BE THERE FOR HIM
AND LOVE HIM--

36:44.470 --> 36:47.406
AND WHO LOVE EACH OTHER.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.312
SO THE ONLY WAY
THIS DEAL WORKS

36:53.345 --> 36:56.448
IS IF THE TWO OF YOU
GET BACK TOGETHER.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.550
- WELL, WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF A BRIBE?

36:58.584 --> 37:01.320
- YOU COULD
LOOK AT IT THAT WAY.

37:01.353 --> 37:06.325
OR YOU CAN THINK OF IT
AS A VERY GENEROUS GIFT.

37:06.358 --> 37:09.295
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT IT--

37:15.301 --> 37:18.404
- DO YOU STILL LOVE ME?

37:18.437 --> 37:21.239
- I NEVER STOPPED.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.381
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

37:29.415 --> 37:31.683
- [whispers]
YEAH.

37:36.822 --> 37:37.956
- OKAY,
LIGHTNING ROUND'S OVER.

37:37.989 --> 37:38.957
DO I HEAR AN ANSWER?

37:38.990 --> 37:41.460
- YES.
- YES.

37:41.493 --> 37:44.363
[both chuckle]

37:44.396 --> 37:45.931
- I LOVE YOU.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.499
- GOD, YOU'RE DYKES
FOR CHRIST SAKE.

37:47.533 --> 37:48.567
TOUGHEN UP.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.502
GIVE ME GUS,
YOU'RE CRUSHING HIM.

37:50.536 --> 37:51.970
both: OHH!

37:52.003 --> 37:54.940
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU.

37:57.876 --> 38:01.813
- AND WHAT ABOUT ME?

38:01.847 --> 38:04.082
- OH, GUI.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.519
I'M SORRY.

38:20.966 --> 38:24.836
- SAY AU REVOIR, GUS.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.706
- OH, DEBBIE,
THIS IS FABULOUS!

38:27.739 --> 38:30.476
- OH, GOOD.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.010
OH, ROMANO!

38:32.043 --> 38:33.912
UH, SUNSHINE, HONEY,
GET US SOME ROMANO,

38:33.945 --> 38:35.981
WOULD YOU, BABY?

38:36.014 --> 38:38.083
UM, I'M AFRAID
IT'S NOT AS FANCY AS THOSE

38:38.116 --> 38:41.019
LITTLE CAVIAR THINGS
MY SON WAS SERVING, BUT--

38:41.052 --> 38:43.054
- WELL, MAN, AND SENATORS,

38:43.088 --> 38:45.624
CANNOT LIVE
ON LITTLE CAVIAR THINGS ALONE.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.825
- OH, THANKS.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.394
IT'S TOO BAD, UM,

38:48.427 --> 38:49.695
MICHAEL COULDN'T JOIN US.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.463
- THANKS, HONEY.
- WELL, THESE DAYS,

38:51.497 --> 38:52.731
COMING OVER TO HIS MOTHER'S
FOR PASTA

38:52.764 --> 38:54.633
AND VINO ISN'T HIS STYLE.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.569
- I-I'M SURE
HE HAD OTHER PLANS.

38:57.603 --> 38:59.905
- YEAH, LIKE DINNER WITH BOBO.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.840
- AND MELISANDE.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.109
- WELL, FUCK HIM.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.445
- [clears throat]

39:06.478 --> 39:08.747
- OH, SORRY, SENATOR.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.949
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.718
I'VE USED THAT WORD MYSELF,

39:12.751 --> 39:14.520
USUALLY FOLLOWED BY BUSH.

39:14.553 --> 39:15.954
[laughter]

39:15.987 --> 39:17.155
- I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.558
- OH, HELL,
LET'S ALL DRINK TO THAT.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.859
- LET ME MAKE A TOAST,
PLEASE.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.595
FIRST OF ALL,
TO OUR WONDERFUL HOSTESS--

39:23.629 --> 39:24.996
DEBBIE.
- THANK YOU.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.098
[overlapping exclamations]

39:27.132 --> 39:28.800
- HERE'S TO YOU, SIS.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.470
- AND TO LITTLE VICTORIES.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.138
- AT LEAST, UH,
DR. PERKINS HAS AGREED

39:33.171 --> 39:34.740
TO TAKE YOUR REQUEST
TO THE SCHOOL BOARD.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.708
- THANKS, SENATOR BAXTER.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.945
- HEY.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.526
- HAVE A SEAT.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.764
- I CAN'T--
I CAN'T STAY.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.566
- YOU CAN'T?

40:00.599 --> 40:03.101
OR YOU DON'T WANT TO?

40:03.134 --> 40:05.671
- [sighs]

40:07.573 --> 40:09.608
- YOU EATEN?

40:12.010 --> 40:15.647
- NO.

40:15.681 --> 40:19.518
- SO PULL UP A CHAIR.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.653
SUNSHINE...

40:21.687 --> 40:25.090
WILL YOU GET MICHAEL
SOME PUTTANESCA, HONEY?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.778
YOU LITTLE ASSHOLE.

40:46.812 --> 40:47.979
SORRY, DI.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.114
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

40:49.147 --> 40:52.117
I'VE USED THAT ONE TOO.

41:00.158 --> 41:05.163
[indistinct
background chatter]

41:29.020 --> 41:32.791
- SO IT ALL WORKED OUT,
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

41:32.824 --> 41:36.562
- THANKS TO THE SENATOR.

41:36.595 --> 41:39.565
- YEAH, DON'T KID YOURSELF.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.600
THAT WOMAN IN THERE
IS USING YOU,

41:41.633 --> 41:43.034
FOR MONEY AND FOR VOTES.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.103
SHE'LL MOVE ON
TO HER NEXT CAUSE,

41:45.136 --> 41:47.138
HER NEXT FUNDRAISER,

41:47.172 --> 41:50.141
THEN WHERE WILL YOU BE?

41:50.175 --> 41:53.545
- SHE SAID
IT'S A SMALL VICTORY.

41:53.579 --> 41:56.882
- WELL, DON'T THINK
THAT YOU'VE WON,

41:56.915 --> 41:59.184
THAT IT'S OVER.

41:59.217 --> 42:00.986
'CAUSE THE MINUTE
YOU DO THAT,

42:01.019 --> 42:04.690
YOU'RE DEAD.

42:21.072 --> 42:25.076
- NOT AS LONG AS I'VE GOT YOU
TO PROTECT ME.
