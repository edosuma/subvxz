00:01.362 --> 00:03.313
Glee: Emma had a crush on Will,

00:03.381 --> 00:05.115
<i>but Will was married;
then Will had a crush on Emma,</i>

00:05.200 --> 00:07.201
<i>so he got a divorce
and he kissed her,</i>

00:07.268 --> 00:08.702
<i>but now she's dating
some dude named Carl.
He's my dentist.</i>

00:08.769 --> 00:09.987
<i>It's a total bummer.</i>

00:10.071 --> 00:11.071
<i>Tina told Artie
to take a hike...</i>

00:11.122 --> 00:12.539
You're a terrible
boyfriend.

00:12.607 --> 00:13.957
<i>...and then she got the hots
for Mike Chang,</i>

00:15.443 --> 00:17.161
<i>I want abs.
So much drama!</i>

00:17.245 --> 00:18.278
<i>And that's
what you missed on Glee.</i>

00:20.632 --> 00:23.467
(bell ringing)
All right, who can tell me

00:23.551 --> 00:24.568
who Christopher Cross is?

00:24.636 --> 00:25.803
He discovered America.

00:27.138 --> 00:28.555
Close.

00:28.623 --> 00:30.624
He did write an iconic
chart topper-- "Sailing."

00:30.675 --> 00:32.558
I have a bad feeling
about this lesson.

00:32.627 --> 00:34.244
Never heard of him,
don't want to hear about him.

00:34.312 --> 00:35.646
Now some people think
of the term

00:35.730 --> 00:37.164
"Easy Listening" as a bad thing.

00:37.232 --> 00:39.316
But I'm going to let this music
speak for itself.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.518
You guys love Lady Gaga
and the Rolling Stones--

00:41.603 --> 00:44.238
and you guys are really good
about putting it all out there.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.023
But really good music

00:46.107 --> 00:47.407
can also be controlled,

00:47.475 --> 00:49.109
and restrained.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.661
It doesn't have to
attack an audience,

00:50.745 --> 00:52.746
it can let them
come to you.

00:52.813 --> 00:54.081
FINN:
How could you get caught

00:54.148 --> 00:55.249
between the moon
and New York City?

00:55.316 --> 00:56.200
They're like
a hundred miles apart.

00:56.284 --> 00:58.285
Mr. Shue? If I may.

00:58.336 --> 01:00.320
I think I speak
for all of us when I say

01:00.371 --> 01:03.624
it's not that we don't love
the idea of spending a week

01:03.675 --> 01:05.257
on this silky smooth
Adult Contemporary,

01:05.310 --> 01:07.394
it's just that, as teens,
this isn't the easiest music

01:07.445 --> 01:08.645
for us to relate to.

01:08.730 --> 01:09.613
However, there is

01:09.697 --> 01:10.848
a burgeoning Facebook campaign

01:10.915 --> 01:14.267
that has swell
to over five members.

01:14.319 --> 01:16.203
The ardent demand:
that this week,

01:16.270 --> 01:17.955
at the fall homecoming assembly,

01:18.039 --> 01:19.239
the McKinley High School
Glee Club

01:19.290 --> 01:21.792
performs a number by...
wait for it...

01:22.627 --> 01:24.244
...Ms. Britney Spears.

01:24.295 --> 01:26.413
Spears, Spears, yeah.

01:26.464 --> 01:27.965
(all agreeing)

01:28.049 --> 01:30.283
Sorry, Kurt,
Kurt, sorry.

01:30.335 --> 01:32.336
No, no, no. I don't think

01:32.420 --> 01:33.720
she's a very good
role model.

01:33.788 --> 01:35.889
But, Mr. Shue, we kind
of grew of up with her.

01:35.957 --> 01:37.674
She's literally why I wanted
to become a peormer.

01:37.759 --> 01:39.142
I don't want to do Britney.

01:39.227 --> 01:40.677
Why no Britney, Brittany?

01:40.762 --> 01:42.145
Because my name is also
Brittany Spears.

01:43.815 --> 01:45.349
What?!
What the hell
is she talking about?

01:45.433 --> 01:47.851
My middle name is Susan,
my last name is Pierce.

01:47.936 --> 01:49.653
That makes me
Brittany S. Pierce.

01:49.737 --> 01:51.355
"Brittany Spierce."

01:51.422 --> 01:53.957
I've lived my entire life
in Britney Spear's shadow.

01:54.025 --> 01:55.859
I will never be as
talented or as famous.

01:55.944 --> 01:58.362
I hope you'll all respect
that I want Glee Club

01:58.429 --> 02:01.314
to remain a place where I,
Brittany S. Pierce,

02:01.366 --> 02:02.983
can escape the torment
of Britney Spears.

02:04.535 --> 02:07.821
Well, there you have it, guys.

02:07.872 --> 02:10.657
It's been decided-- no Britney.
Sorry.

02:10.708 --> 02:12.542
Thanks, Britt. Thanks a lot.

02:12.627 --> 02:14.094
Leave Brittany alone.

02:14.161 --> 02:16.346
Thank you for
understanding.

02:16.431 --> 02:17.798
It's been a hard road.

02:19.434 --> 02:20.934
Um, can we move on?
Yes.

02:21.002 --> 02:23.840
Let's talk about Michael Bolton.

02:24.038 --> 02:28.508
<i>Sync by YesCool
www.addic7ed.com </i>

02:28.559 --> 02:30.677
I know that Britney's had
some issues in the past,

02:30.728 --> 02:32.279
but I actually think
it's quite admirable

02:32.346 --> 02:33.697
the way she's gotten
her life back together.

02:33.781 --> 02:35.032
I mean, sn't
she had, what, like,

02:35.116 --> 02:37.901
three number-one hits
in the past two years?

02:37.986 --> 02:39.820
She's a single mom
raising two kids.

02:39.871 --> 02:41.321
I think she's
the perfect symbol

02:41.372 --> 02:42.406
for the possibility
of rebirth.

02:42.490 --> 02:44.241
I can't...

02:44.325 --> 02:46.994
See, that's your problem, Will
you're too uptight.

02:47.045 --> 02:48.862
Oh, you're calling me uptight?
Mm-hmm.

02:48.913 --> 02:50.864
The woman who buys hand
sanitizer by the barrel?

02:50.915 --> 02:53.483
I admit I have had
some control issues in the past,

02:53.551 --> 02:55.385
but Carl's been helping me
with all of that.

02:55.470 --> 02:57.054
Really?
Mm-hmm.

02:57.138 --> 02:58.305
Wow. Um, like how?

02:58.372 --> 02:59.840
Um, so, the other day,
he made me buy

02:59.891 --> 03:03.644
the green grapes and the red
grapes at the market.

03:03.711 --> 03:05.345
and then we just mix them
together in a bowl

03:05.396 --> 03:07.731
and we just ate them.
It was madness. Sheer madness.

03:07.815 --> 03:08.765
Wow.

03:08.850 --> 03:11.318
You know what, that's fine.

03:11.386 --> 03:12.886
Make fun all you want,

03:12.937 --> 03:14.788
but it's a start, and I am
incredibly grateful for it.

03:14.856 --> 03:16.857
Hey, now.
Am I interrupting?

03:16.924 --> 03:18.742
Carl, no. Hi.

03:18.810 --> 03:20.293
What are you doing here?

03:20.361 --> 03:23.013
I thought I'd surprise you
and take you to lunch.

03:23.081 --> 03:25.032
Oh, I love that look
of instant panic

03:25.083 --> 03:26.533
every time I try
to change your routine.

03:26.584 --> 03:28.285
Adorable.

03:28.369 --> 03:31.621
And you must be Will.

03:31.706 --> 03:33.290
Emma told me you're
the cutest guy in school.

03:33.374 --> 03:35.208
Will, you grind your teeth?

03:35.259 --> 03:36.960
(cell phone buzzing)
I... I don't think so.

03:37.045 --> 03:38.812
Damn it.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.063
What? What's wrong?

03:40.131 --> 03:41.298
Another teenager
needs a root canal.

03:41.366 --> 03:42.766
I swear, not one student
in this school

03:42.850 --> 03:44.885
is going to have their teeth
by the time they're 30.

03:44.952 --> 03:46.252
Oh, the sugar
kids eat today.

03:46.304 --> 03:48.021
Carl has been trying
to get the school board

03:48.089 --> 03:49.756
to let him come and do a
seminar on good dental hygiene,

03:49.807 --> 03:51.958
but they've been dragging
their feet.

03:52.026 --> 03:55.428
Why don't you come
talk to Glee Club.
Well, that would be

03:55.480 --> 03:56.997
a dream, Will.

03:57.065 --> 03:59.149
Yeah.
Yeah, Will, that
would be amazing.

03:59.233 --> 04:01.651
I'm usually pretty tight
about our rehearsal schedule,

04:01.736 --> 04:04.988
but I think I can loosen
the reins a bit for Carl.

04:05.073 --> 04:06.707
The kids can't sing

04:06.774 --> 04:08.125
without teeth, right?
No.

04:08.209 --> 04:10.377
They'd be... they
wouldn't be singing.

04:10.444 --> 04:11.745
They'd be gumming.

04:11.796 --> 04:13.246
♪ Muh-muh-muh-muh... ♪

04:13.297 --> 04:15.582
(bell ringing)

04:15.633 --> 04:16.666
Gimme this jacket!

04:16.750 --> 04:18.752
Hey, give me that back!
I earned that!

04:18.803 --> 04:20.954
This jacket belongs to people
who are actually on the team.

04:21.005 --> 04:23.924
But you know what?
We're going to restyle it

04:23.975 --> 04:27.293
to represent the obvious duality
in your sexuality.

04:33.017 --> 04:34.901
Oh, you're trying
to swing at me?
Swing, huh?

04:34.969 --> 04:36.153
Come on, swing at me.

04:36.237 --> 04:37.637
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, let's go!

04:37.688 --> 04:39.072
Sorry to interrupt.

04:39.140 --> 04:40.774
I'm actually glad you're here
to see this.

04:40.825 --> 04:42.943
Finn, I just wanted to apologize

04:42.994 --> 04:44.361
for getting you kicked off
the football team.

04:44.445 --> 04:46.446
I just hope there's
no hard feelings.

04:48.616 --> 04:49.833
So what are you guys
talking about?

04:49.917 --> 04:51.334
Dude, take him.
This wheelchair kid

04:51.419 --> 04:53.587
is in the way, man-- what if I
knock him over or something?

04:53.654 --> 04:55.372
There's something
not right about

04:55.440 --> 04:57.424
hitting a kid
in a wheelchair.
You know, the only thing

04:57.491 --> 04:59.960
that's saving you right now
is my moral code.

05:00.011 --> 05:03.096
I don't hit crippled people.
But I'll be back.

05:03.164 --> 05:04.548
We're gonna
be back.

05:04.632 --> 05:06.266
(groans)

05:10.521 --> 05:11.855
All right, so here's the deal.

05:11.939 --> 05:13.607
You chew this little capsule.
Now if there's

05:13.674 --> 05:15.025
any plaque you missed,

05:15.093 --> 05:16.643
the dye will stick to it
and turn your teeth blue.

05:16.694 --> 05:19.146
Can I just say that you are the
hottest dentist I've ever seen?

05:19.197 --> 05:21.347
I get that all the time.
No, like, seriously,

05:21.399 --> 05:22.566
you can totally drill me
whenever...

05:22.650 --> 05:25.318
Santana. Okay,
let's stay focused.

05:25.369 --> 05:26.953
Rock n' roll, Emms.

05:27.021 --> 05:28.705
And besides, this guy...

05:28.790 --> 05:30.791
now this guy's pretty
easy on the eyes too, huh?

05:30.858 --> 05:33.243
And you know what?
No matter how hard I tried,

05:33.327 --> 05:35.045
I bet I couldn't sing
and dance like him.

05:35.129 --> 05:36.863
Uh, probably not.

05:36.914 --> 05:39.549
All right, let's take a look
at those chompers, huh?

05:39.634 --> 05:41.134
Before we chew,
I would just like to alert

05:41.202 --> 05:42.719
Mr. Shue that there's
been a new addition

05:42.804 --> 05:44.888
to the Britney Spears
Facebook campaign.

05:44.956 --> 05:46.539
Sorry. The answer's
still no.

05:46.591 --> 05:48.925
Capsules, guys.

05:49.010 --> 05:50.677
Yes, chew away.
Chew, chew.

Aw!

06:09.113 --> 06:10.764
FINN:
It's okay, baby.
I don't understand.

06:10.832 --> 06:12.732
I floss between classes.
Well, sometimes
it's genetics.

06:12.783 --> 06:14.701
ARTIE:
I think I might be better

06:14.752 --> 06:16.786
at brushing and flossing if I
could see myself in the mirror.

06:16.871 --> 06:17.871
There you go, blue tooth.

06:17.922 --> 06:19.089
BRITTANY:
I don't brush my teeth.

06:19.173 --> 06:21.007
I rinse my mouth out
with soda after I eat.

06:21.075 --> 06:22.459
I was pretty sure
Dr. Pepper

06:22.543 --> 06:23.576
was a dentist.

06:23.628 --> 06:24.628
CARL:
I got this, Em.

06:24.712 --> 06:26.596
With some deep bleaching
or scaling,

06:26.681 --> 06:28.298
you'll be
as good as new.

06:28.382 --> 06:29.432
All right, open up.

06:29.517 --> 06:32.352
Nah, close.

06:33.554 --> 06:34.387
Close again.

06:37.408 --> 06:39.209
This room looks like the one
on that spaceship

06:39.277 --> 06:40.277
where I got probed.

06:40.344 --> 06:42.195
So, Brittany, you, uh,

06:42.263 --> 06:44.130
you have the the worst
teeth I've ever seen.

06:44.198 --> 06:46.316
You have cavities in
every single tooth.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.434
This has got to be
some sort of record.

06:48.486 --> 06:49.936
Please don't pull all my teeth.

06:49.987 --> 06:52.438
My smile will look like
an adult baby butt with boobs.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.074
All right, I'm going
to put you under

06:54.125 --> 06:55.075
with a little general
anesthesia.

06:55.126 --> 06:56.276
You won't feel a thing.

06:56.327 --> 06:57.527
Like roofies?

06:57.595 --> 07:00.463
Yeah, totally.

07:00.548 --> 07:03.500
I'll put on Pandora...

4 You" playing)

09:14.131 --> 09:15.782
Mm. Rock on.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.817
I'm going to have
to see you tomorrow.

09:17.885 --> 09:21.104
You have 68 cavities.
I couldn't get 'em all today.

09:21.172 --> 09:23.873
Can I have a blue toothbrush?

09:23.941 --> 09:26.343
I'll give you
a hundred toothbrushes.
Okay.

09:26.410 --> 09:28.511

09:28.596 --> 09:29.913
(bell ringing)
No.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.214
You all right?

09:31.298 --> 09:32.799
You seem a little down.

09:32.850 --> 09:34.768
Didn't you like the
banana bread I baked you?

09:34.835 --> 09:36.603
Yeah, it was awesome.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.688
It's just-- how
do you feel about me

09:38.773 --> 09:40.974
not being on the
football team anymore?

09:41.025 --> 09:42.726
I'm actually kind
of happy about it.

you were in a coma.

09:47.114 --> 09:49.149
Yeah.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.117
I'm just so not cool
now, you know.

09:51.185 --> 09:52.702
Well, it's just less
of a chance

09:52.737 --> 09:54.353
of you running off
with some cheerleader.

09:54.405 --> 09:56.623
Wait, so you want me
to feel bad about myself?

09:56.690 --> 09:58.124
No, I just...

09:58.192 --> 09:59.876
I want to be the only thing
that makes you feel good.

10:01.579 --> 10:02.796
I'm just trying to be honest.

10:25.469 --> 10:27.087
Your teeth are perfect.

10:27.171 --> 10:28.238
That's right.

10:28.306 --> 10:29.806
Well, I can't just
put you under.

10:29.873 --> 10:32.442
Anesthesia isn't something
to joke about. It's serious.

10:32.510 --> 10:34.628
Okay, listen, my dad's a doctor.

10:34.695 --> 10:36.930
And not a "tooth doctor,"
a real one.

10:36.998 --> 10:38.265
He, like, went
to college or something.

10:38.332 --> 10:40.233
Which means I have a killer
health care plan

10:40.318 --> 10:41.768
that pretty much pays
for everything.

10:41.836 --> 10:45.438
So get up in my grill,
'cause Britts and I wants

10:45.523 --> 10:46.690
to get our anesthesia on.

10:46.741 --> 10:48.725
That's totally cool.

10:48.776 --> 10:50.393
Hmm, okay, I guess
I can give you

10:50.444 --> 10:51.695

13:36.660 --> 13:39.179
Brittany.
I would just like to say
that from now on,

13:39.263 --> 13:41.831
I demand to have every
solo in Glee Club.

13:41.899 --> 13:43.800
What?
When I had my teeth cleaned,

13:43.851 --> 13:45.969
I had the most amazing
Britney Spears fantasy.

13:46.020 --> 13:48.037
I sang and danced better
than her.

13:48.105 --> 13:50.557
Now I realize what a powerful
woman I truly am.

13:50.641 --> 13:53.326
I went with her, and I had
a Britney fantasy, too.

13:53.394 --> 13:54.477
Although now that
I'm thinking

13:54.528 --> 13:56.345
about it, I'm not
really sure how

13:56.397 --> 13:57.647
our fantasies combined.

13:57.698 --> 13:58.798
SANTANA: That doesn't
make any sense.

13:58.866 --> 14:00.400
See, Mr. Shue? I told you.

14:00.484 --> 14:03.486
Britney Spears busted our Brit
out of her everyday, fragmented

14:03.554 --> 14:05.121
haze of confusion
and gave her

14:05.189 --> 14:06.689
the confidence
to step up and perform.

14:06.740 --> 14:08.791
I'm more talented
than all of you.

14:08.859 --> 14:10.043
I see that clearly now.

14:10.127 --> 14:11.578
It's Brittany, bitch.

14:11.662 --> 14:14.831
Guys, we're not doing
Britney Spears, and that's that.

14:14.882 --> 14:16.799
Mr. Shue, you're letting your
own personal issues

14:16.867 --> 14:18.301
get in the way of
something that

14:18.368 --> 14:21.421
we are all telling you
we  really want to do.

14:21.505 --> 14:24.373
I mean, this club regularly pays
tribute to pop culture,

14:24.425 --> 14:26.375
<i>and Britney Spears

14:26.427 --> 14:27.727

is heretical!

about this!

14:29.396 --> 14:32.148

would you?!

What?

15:04.848 --> 15:07.383
Well, this is clearly awkward
for the two of us.

15:07.434 --> 15:12.138
All right, let's
talk it out, bro-to-bro.

15:12.223 --> 15:14.774
Fine. Bro.

15:14.858 --> 15:17.727
I still have feelings
for Emma; strong feelings.

15:17.795 --> 15:19.095
So do I.

15:19.146 --> 15:20.763
The difference is
she chose me.

15:20.814 --> 15:23.233
I don't know what's
gonna happen with Emma and I,

15:23.300 --> 15:25.401
but I do ask is that you back
off until we figure it out.

15:25.452 --> 15:28.738
What if I tell you that I don't
think I could do that?

15:28.806 --> 15:29.856
Rinse.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.943
Will, put yourself in my shoes.

15:33.994 --> 15:35.828
I mean, say it doesn't work out

15:35.913 --> 15:39.082
between the two of us,
and she chooses to go
back to you.

15:39.133 --> 15:41.601
How would you feel if I continue
to come after her?

15:41.669 --> 15:44.220
Okay, fine.
I'll back off.

15:44.288 --> 15:47.390
But the second she starts
leaning my way, I am back in.

15:47.457 --> 15:48.341
Deal?

15:48.425 --> 15:50.310
Deal. Now open back up.

15:50.394 --> 15:51.728
I want to continue
this examination.

15:53.647 --> 15:55.148
Ah...
No more "ah's".

15:55.232 --> 15:56.482
Oh.
You know what?

15:56.567 --> 15:58.184
I got just the thing for you.

16:01.972 --> 16:04.440
Candy?

16:04.508 --> 16:05.825
You gotta loosen up
and bang, bro.

16:05.909 --> 16:07.143
I mean, you're grinding

16:07.194 --> 16:08.945
those beautiful little teeth
down to nubs.

16:08.996 --> 16:10.646
You know, I honestly think
that's why you

16:10.698 --> 16:12.081
and Emma
didn't work out.

16:12.149 --> 16:13.483
There's not an impulsive bone
between the two of you.

16:13.550 --> 16:15.651
And you think eating candy is
gonna change that?

16:15.703 --> 16:16.986
You gotta get ridiculous, bro.

16:17.054 --> 16:18.288
You gotta
just start doing

16:18.355 --> 16:19.589
things that feel good
for no good reason.

16:19.657 --> 16:22.041
You know, I used
to get up at the same time

16:22.126 --> 16:23.826
ever day and have
the same eggs.

16:23.877 --> 16:25.211
Then, one day, I'm driving
the hybrid to work,

16:25.296 --> 16:26.495
I pass
a Chevy dealership.

16:26.547 --> 16:28.464
The new Corvettes had
just come in, so I stopped

16:28.515 --> 16:30.717
right on the spot, I make
a U-turn and I buy one.

16:30.801 --> 16:33.136
Now I take the top down,
take Emma for a spin,

16:33.187 --> 16:35.355
she doesn't even care
if her hair gets messed up.

16:35.439 --> 16:36.306
You follow me?

16:40.394 --> 16:41.944
Hey, Rachel.

16:42.012 --> 16:43.363
Hey, Mr. Shue.

16:43.447 --> 16:45.999
You all set? You need me to stay
with you or anything?

16:46.066 --> 16:48.284
No, I've been taking herbal
anti-anxiety pills and reading

16:48.352 --> 16:50.870
<i>The Unauthorized Biography of
Britney Spears to stay calm.</i>

16:50.954 --> 16:53.189
I look forward to the day
the paparazzi provokes me

16:53.240 --> 16:54.357
and I attack them.

16:54.408 --> 16:55.708
Are you okay?

16:55.776 --> 16:56.909

like my new look?

Don't you think
it's a bit much?

this relationship to work,

20:27.929 --> 20:29.213
we can't control each other.

Emma.

22:00.021 --> 22:02.523

Actually...

22:02.574 --> 22:04.875
I think you should
keep this car.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.210

to come to your senses, Will,

22:15.837 --> 22:18.422

22:18.507 --> 22:20.841

congratulations.

like the fantasy

of a perverted
Japanese businessman

with a very dark,

22:54.226 --> 22:56.343
though I risk expulsion
by saying so,

22:56.411 --> 23:00.164
is that it seems Britney Spears
has really helped you blossom.

is that true?

Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy...

23:08.423 --> 23:10.591
Hey, hey.
RACHEL:
Look, all I know is that I had

23:10.642 --> 23:12.593
a very vivid Britney Spears
fantasy at the dentist,

23:12.644 --> 23:14.428
and since then,
it's made me feel free

23:14.479 --> 23:16.197
to get out of my own way.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.299
I think I've just
always been afraid

23:18.366 --> 23:19.733
to dress like a pretty girl

23:19.801 --> 23:21.869
because I've never really felt
like one before.

23:21.937 --> 23:23.871
Now I realize it's okay
to feel that way

23:23.938 --> 23:25.239
about yourself
every now and again.

23:25.290 --> 23:27.241
And maybe it's a good thing.

23:27.292 --> 23:30.628
It's such a good thing.
I can't believe it.

23:30.712 --> 23:32.046

23:36.151 --> 23:37.251
You have
got to be kidding me.

23:37.319 --> 23:38.669
I was headed to the
library computers

23:38.753 --> 23:40.221
late last night

23:40.288 --> 23:42.590
to score my Cheerios some
cheap tickets on one of those

23:42.641 --> 23:44.475
off-brand airlines with
shoddy safety records--

23:44.559 --> 23:46.644
you know, to fly
my JV squad,

23:46.728 --> 23:47.961
so if the plane did go down,

23:48.013 --> 23:49.463
well, it wouldn't be
that big of a deal.

23:49.514 --> 23:52.566
But then... horror!

23:52.634 --> 23:54.351
JACOB (over computer): Rachel,
are you aware you've never

23:54.436 --> 23:55.769
been hotter
than you are right now

23:55.820 --> 23:57.154
dressed as Britney Spears?
RACHEL: Thank you.

23:57.222 --> 23:59.190
JACOB: Can I put
some clothes on, please?

23:59.257 --> 24:00.624
No.

24:00.692 --> 24:02.860
I want you to feel the beads
of your own sweaty,

24:02.944 --> 24:05.696
depraved stank
dripping down your butt crack.

24:05.780 --> 24:08.232
Rachel Berry was dressing
like Britney Spears,

24:08.300 --> 24:17.341
and I was titillated.
Oh, dear God,

24:17.425 --> 24:19.426
if you know what I mean.

24:20.995 --> 24:22.463
That is really gross, Sue,
but they're kids.

24:22.514 --> 24:24.031
Hormones.

24:24.099 --> 24:26.634
William, I realize you're
still mourning the loss

24:26.685 --> 24:29.019
of that bony redheaded
hominid you're in love with.

24:29.104 --> 24:30.337
I understand that.

24:30.388 --> 24:32.356
I also understand
that you bought

24:32.440 --> 24:34.258
a brand-new car
to impress her.

24:34.326 --> 24:36.176
You're flailing, William.

24:36.228 --> 24:38.345
Now, I'm secretly hoping
it's a midlife crisis,

24:38.396 --> 24:39.897
which means you're halfway
to an early death,

24:39.981 --> 24:42.566
affording me a blissful,
demented convalescence

24:42.634 --> 24:44.852
spent peeing on your grave.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.037
(chuckles)
What's your point, Sue?

24:47.122 --> 24:49.290
Don't let your own recklessness
blind you to the fact

24:49.357 --> 24:51.141
that Britney Spears
is a genius

24:51.209 --> 24:53.494
pop-culture provocateur
and a gateway drug

24:53.545 --> 24:56.297
to every out-of-control
impulse ever created.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.916
This school is a powder keg
of sexual deviance, William,

24:59.000 --> 25:00.567
and in my office,

25:00.635 --> 25:04.088
I have a chair with a naked
butt sweat stain to prove it.

25:04.172 --> 25:05.623
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

25:05.690 --> 25:08.208
<i>It's like an inkblot test,
that butt sweat stain.</i>

25:08.276 --> 25:10.194
Stare into it, William,

25:10.262 --> 25:12.796
and you will see the
light of all that is good

25:12.864 --> 25:14.148
go out of the world.

25:18.186 --> 25:20.154
Wait just a second, now.

25:20.221 --> 25:21.672
You look more
confused than ever.

25:21.740 --> 25:24.891
Is your Glee Club
doing Britney Spears music?

25:24.943 --> 25:26.126
Is that why Rachel
was wearing

25:26.194 --> 25:27.778
that inappropriate outfit?

25:27.862 --> 25:29.730
No.

25:29.781 --> 25:32.916
No, we are not doing Britney.

25:32.984 --> 25:36.036
Okay. Just checking.

25:46.440 --> 25:48.257
I'm serious-- you should put
ranch dressing on it.

25:48.325 --> 25:50.943
On pizza?
Yeah, it's delicious.
You should try it.

25:51.011 --> 25:53.762
I'm 100% in love
with you right now.

25:55.198 --> 25:56.265
Hey, Britney.

25:56.316 --> 25:57.616
Oh, hey, Artie.

25:57.701 --> 25:58.934
Girl, you are such a fool

25:58.985 --> 26:00.953
for breaking up
with such a sweetheart.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.371
I know, Britney.

27:59.890 --> 28:04.243
(bell ringing)

28:04.327 --> 28:05.528
What are you doing?

28:05.579 --> 28:08.914
Oh. I'm, uh,
going to run some laps.

28:08.999 --> 28:11.750
Gonna get back in shape
and back on the team.

28:11.835 --> 28:12.918
That's what I came here
to talk to you about.

28:13.003 --> 28:13.953
I want on the team, too.

28:14.037 --> 28:15.120
Every day,
Tina and Mike's

28:15.205 --> 28:16.589
Asian fusion grows stronger.

28:16.656 --> 28:19.675
Look, I want to help you,
dude, but...

28:19.742 --> 28:22.261
kind of need to take care
of myself right now.

28:23.597 --> 28:25.514
I'm sorry.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.183
I had a vision
at the dentist.

28:28.251 --> 28:29.685
You and I were
out on the field

28:29.752 --> 28:31.537
with the team, playing football.

28:31.605 --> 28:33.122
We were unstoppable.

28:33.189 --> 28:35.391
I just know that if we can show
what I can do

28:35.442 --> 28:36.909
to Coach Beiste,
she'd put me on the team.

28:36.977 --> 28:38.644
Show me what?

28:40.614 --> 28:42.047
I... I wanted to ask you
to reconsider

28:42.115 --> 28:43.449
putting me on the football team.

28:43.533 --> 28:45.267
I'm not with him on this one.

28:45.335 --> 28:46.986
Well, you should be.
I need you

28:47.053 --> 28:48.537
to help him get his uniform.

28:48.605 --> 28:50.039
What?

28:50.106 --> 28:52.625
Well, don't just stare at me
like a donkey with a wooden leg.

28:52.709 --> 28:53.775
Go see the equipment manager,

28:53.827 --> 28:56.295
and you boys get out
on the field.

28:56.363 --> 28:58.147
Practice starts
in five minutes.

28:58.214 --> 28:59.748
Thanks, Coach.
We won't let you down.

28:59.799 --> 29:01.417
Well, come on. Go!

29:01.468 --> 29:03.302
FINN:
Those are on backwards.

29:06.623 --> 29:08.257
(bell ringing)

29:08.308 --> 29:10.175
I was pretty sure
Artie's legs don't work.

29:10.260 --> 29:11.793
Did you get
a leg transplant?
ARTIE: Nope.

29:11.845 --> 29:13.596
My teammates can push my chair
like a battering ram.

29:13.663 --> 29:15.314
Yeah, there's no rules
against it. We checked.

29:15.398 --> 29:17.116
And I have Britney Spears
to thank.
You're welcome.

29:17.183 --> 29:18.400
ARTIE: Britney plus
nitrous gave me

29:18.468 --> 29:19.652
an amazing idea, and it gave me

29:19.719 --> 29:20.953
the nerve
to tell Coach Beiste

29:21.021 --> 29:23.455
that Finn and I both really want
to be on the team.

29:23.523 --> 29:25.874
Wait. You're back
on the football team?
Yeah.

29:25.942 --> 29:28.477
Suddenly, you're way hotter
to me. Weird.

29:28.528 --> 29:29.978
Wait. I don't get it.

29:30.030 --> 29:31.814
How come everyone's having
Britney Spears fantasies?

29:31.881 --> 29:34.066
The nitrous oxide dentists
use is a mild hallucinogen.

29:34.134 --> 29:36.101
Studies have proven
that it induces vivid dreams,

29:36.169 --> 29:37.920
often the last thing
the patient thinks of.

29:37.987 --> 29:39.088
The subconscious moves
to the forefront.

29:39.155 --> 29:40.122
Since we've all
been thinking

29:40.173 --> 29:41.023
so much about
Britney,

29:41.091 --> 29:42.291
it only stands to reason.

29:42.342 --> 29:44.043
Okay, guys, listen up.

29:44.127 --> 29:45.761
Mr. Shue, if I may?

29:45.828 --> 29:47.829
Kurt, I overheard what you guys
were just talking about,

29:47.881 --> 29:49.381
and I know what you're
going to say.

29:49.466 --> 29:50.999
The answer is no.

29:51.051 --> 29:53.602
No, I'm not going to stand
in the way anymore.

29:53.670 --> 29:55.387
If you guys want to do Britney

29:55.472 --> 29:57.940
at this year's homecoming
assembly, I'm fine with it.

29:58.008 --> 29:59.525
(cheering, excited chatter)

29:59.609 --> 30:02.277
WILL:
I know. Oh...

30:02.345 --> 30:04.396
And more than that,

30:04.481 --> 30:06.515
I am going
to perform with you.

30:06.566 --> 30:07.983
(cheering and chatter stop)

30:08.034 --> 30:10.519
(chuckles) Right?

30:14.875 --> 30:18.277
(bell ringing)

30:18.328 --> 30:19.795
I always thought
the boys' locker room

30:19.880 --> 30:23.215
would be all sexy, but actually,
it smells like feet in here.

30:23.283 --> 30:25.501
Oh, Rachel,
you can't be in here.

30:25.585 --> 30:27.469
You changed back to
your old clothes.

30:27.537 --> 30:30.389
I just want you to know that I
heard everything that you said

30:30.456 --> 30:32.224
and that I respect your needs,

30:32.292 --> 30:34.894
and I'll do anything
to make you feel safe and happy.

30:34.961 --> 30:36.295
Cool.

30:36.346 --> 30:37.813
Well, thanks. I gotta go.

30:37.898 --> 30:39.732
Wait... (stammers)

30:39.799 --> 30:41.767
I mean... d-don't you want

30:41.818 --> 30:44.403
to make me feel safe
and happy, too?

30:44.470 --> 30:45.988
Well, yeah. Yeah, sure.

30:46.072 --> 30:47.189
Wait. Wait.

30:47.274 --> 30:49.491
Do you want me to quit football?

30:49.576 --> 30:50.976
Look, how am I supposed to trust

30:51.027 --> 30:52.411
that you're not just
going to stray again?

30:52.478 --> 30:55.364
Remember your little fling
with Brittany and Santana?

30:55.448 --> 30:57.333
I do... all right?
Let's face it, Finn--

30:57.417 --> 30:59.651
the only way that this
relationship is going to work

30:59.703 --> 31:01.670
is if we're both losers.

31:01.755 --> 31:03.589
Okay. Come here.

31:05.158 --> 31:06.825
This is how it's gonna happen:

31:06.877 --> 31:08.761
I'm going to be
quarterback again,

31:08.828 --> 31:11.096
then I'm going to throw a
touchdown in our first game,

31:11.164 --> 31:12.715
and then point to you
in the stands

31:12.799 --> 31:15.267
so that everybody in the school
knows you're my girlfriend.

31:15.335 --> 31:17.136
All right?

31:17.187 --> 31:18.503
That's very
romantic, but...

31:20.006 --> 31:21.506
I don't know.

31:24.110 --> 31:27.947
Rachel, you can't ask me to
choose between you and football.

31:28.014 --> 31:29.615
Well, I am.

31:37.123 --> 31:39.375
(sighs)

31:39.459 --> 31:41.293
(bell ringing)

31:42.712 --> 31:44.663
EMMA: You need to sit
where you can be seen.

31:44.714 --> 31:45.998
Why don't you sit at the top

31:46.049 --> 31:47.466
and wave your big,
foamy finger?

31:47.533 --> 31:49.668
Yeah? Up there.

31:49.719 --> 31:51.536
It's so, so exciting!

31:53.556 --> 31:56.558
You know, I can get you
backstage if you want.
Oh, hey.

31:56.643 --> 31:58.344
Hey.
You're all dressed up.

31:58.395 --> 32:00.562
<i>You look like a cast member
of Kids Incorporated.</i>

32:00.647 --> 32:02.431
Well, I really want
to loosen up a bit,

32:02.515 --> 32:04.149
so I'm, uh, helping
the kids do Britney.

32:04.217 --> 32:06.185
(laughs)
Outrageous, right?

32:06.236 --> 32:07.386
Yeah.
Oh.

32:07.437 --> 32:09.554
Showtime.

32:09.606 --> 32:11.223
SUE:
Sit down!

32:11.274 --> 32:13.158
There's nothing
to stand up and cheer about.

32:13.226 --> 32:14.827
Hey, Coach!

32:14.894 --> 32:16.745
The glee club's doing
Britney Spears for the assembly.

32:16.830 --> 32:18.831
I just found out.

32:20.417 --> 32:21.867
Becky, you're on red alert.

32:21.918 --> 32:23.702
If you see any awkward
teenage frottage,

32:23.753 --> 32:26.255
you perform that
citizen's arrest we practiced.

32:26.339 --> 32:28.240
Got it, Coach.

32:30.377 --> 32:31.627
(feedback screeching)

32:31.711 --> 32:33.112
Quiet, please, children.

32:33.179 --> 32:34.847
Quiet now.

32:34.914 --> 32:38.684
First, students
who ate the ravioli today

32:38.751 --> 32:41.753
and are not up-to-date
on their tetanus shots

32:41.805 --> 32:43.605
should see the nurse
immediately.

32:43.673 --> 32:47.943
Welcome to our homecoming
pep assembly.

32:48.011 --> 32:51.864
Because of last week's grisly
train derailment,

32:51.931 --> 32:55.901
the dulcimer club is on hiatus
until further notice.

32:55.969 --> 32:59.038
But do we ever have
a treat for you.

32:59.105 --> 33:02.708
Fresh off their last place
finish at the Regionals,

33:02.775 --> 33:06.412
please give it up
for the New Directions!

33:06.463 --> 33:08.047
(scattered applause)

(Sue clears throat)

36:03.337 --> 36:04.287
(sighs)

36:04.371 --> 36:05.672
How you doing, Sue?

36:05.739 --> 36:07.240
Not sure if you heard, William,

36:07.291 --> 36:09.575
but my spinal column
was ruptured in a sex riot.

36:09.627 --> 36:10.960
Sue, you pulled the alarm.

36:11.045 --> 36:12.545
Everything was going fine!

36:12.613 --> 36:14.514
You know, William, that's
what one Hubert Humphrey said

36:14.581 --> 36:17.517
back in 1968 at the start of the
Democratic National Convention.

36:17.584 --> 36:20.270
But then hippies put acid
in everyone's bourbon.

36:20.354 --> 36:21.704
And when an
updraft revealed

36:21.772 --> 36:23.473
Lady Bird Johnson's tramp stamp

36:23.541 --> 36:25.859
and tattoos above her ovaries,
Mayor Richard J. Daley

36:25.926 --> 36:27.527
became so incensed
with sexual rage

36:27.594 --> 36:29.562
that he punched
his own wife in the face

36:29.630 --> 36:31.247
and spent the next
hour screaming

36:31.315 --> 36:33.283
"sex party" into
the microphones of

36:33.367 --> 36:34.934
all three major networks.

36:34.985 --> 36:36.819
Okay, I'm pretty sure
none of that happened.

36:36.887 --> 36:38.738
You can expect a call
very soon from my lawyer--

36:38.806 --> 36:40.139
Gloria Allred.

36:40.207 --> 36:42.158
I'm gonna sue the
pants off you, Will.

36:42.243 --> 36:45.245
I'm gonna take your
house, your car,

36:45.296 --> 36:47.213
your extensive
collection of vests.

36:47.281 --> 36:48.648
I mean, seriously,

36:48.716 --> 36:50.633
<i>you wear more vests than
the cast of Blossom.</i>

36:52.069 --> 36:53.953
And I'll see you in court.

36:56.557 --> 36:57.390
(sighs)

36:58.592 --> 37:00.293
Emma...

37:01.562 --> 37:03.629
Look, what I did
was a little weird.

37:03.681 --> 37:04.931
I know that.
It was inappropriate

37:04.982 --> 37:06.649
for me to do Britney
with the kids.

37:06.734 --> 37:10.019
I just thought you wanted me
to be less uptight.

37:10.104 --> 37:12.905
Will, I just wanted
you to relax.

37:14.792 --> 37:16.542
You know, not
stop being you.

37:18.128 --> 37:20.129
I kn you're frustrated.

37:20.214 --> 37:23.049
You know, Terri's still on your
case, you lost at regionals,

37:23.117 --> 37:24.851
Glee's still the bottom
pickle in the barrel...

37:24.918 --> 37:26.585
You and Carl.

37:26.637 --> 37:28.638
Yeah. Me and Carl.

37:30.190 --> 37:32.292
Especially me and Carl.

37:32.359 --> 37:35.144
Look, have you ever noticed
that Britney Spears

37:35.229 --> 37:36.696
only makes great music

37:36.763 --> 37:39.299
when she's not chasing
down paparazzi?

37:39.366 --> 37:41.818
She can't just swallow a grenade
and let her talent explode

37:41.902 --> 37:43.136
all over the world.

37:43.203 --> 37:45.138
She's got to rein it in,
just like you do.

37:45.205 --> 37:47.790
You're such a great
teacher, Will.

37:47.875 --> 37:49.742
No, probably the best
in the whole school.

37:49.793 --> 37:51.744
So why would you want
to be someone else

37:51.795 --> 37:53.212
when the someone
that you already are

37:53.280 --> 37:54.414
is so amazing.

37:54.481 --> 37:58.334
Because the boring
someone I already am..

37:58.402 --> 38:00.053
wasn't good enough for you.

38:04.425 --> 38:06.009
Hey, where you going?

38:06.093 --> 38:08.294
To return that car.

38:08.345 --> 38:11.481
(bell ringing)

38:11.565 --> 38:13.016
U.S. History...

38:13.100 --> 38:14.484
Crap, I forgot
I was taking that.

38:14.568 --> 38:16.269
Congrats, Finn.

38:16.320 --> 38:19.605
You're back on the team,
I'm head cheerleader again.

38:19.657 --> 38:22.692
Some kind of symmetry,
don't you think?

38:22.776 --> 38:25.995
With all the nastiness
between you and I behind us,

38:26.080 --> 38:27.947
I think we should be together.

38:27.998 --> 38:30.283
We'd be a shoo-in
for Homecoming king and queen.

38:30.334 --> 38:31.650
So what do you say?

38:31.702 --> 38:32.869
You and me,

38:32.953 --> 38:35.821
8:00, Breadstix?

38:35.873 --> 38:38.841
Look, I'd be lying if I said I
didn't have feelings for you.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.378
Probably always will.

38:44.765 --> 38:46.599
But I'm not gonna get
back together with you.

38:46.667 --> 38:49.135
There's someone else,
and you know who that is.

38:49.186 --> 38:50.353
I'm asking you
to respect that.

38:52.356 --> 38:53.690
I'm sorry.

39:04.118 --> 39:05.518
I said what you
wanted me to,

39:05.569 --> 39:07.987
he shot me down.

39:08.038 --> 39:09.855
So congrats.

39:09.907 --> 39:11.157
Looks like he
really loves you.

39:16.130 --> 39:18.081
(bell ringing)

39:18.165 --> 39:19.132
All right.

39:19.199 --> 39:20.466
Rachel?

39:20.534 --> 39:22.668
I have a song that I've prepared
for the class.

39:22.720 --> 39:25.338
Sorry, Rachel, no Britney.
I'm really happy that

39:25.389 --> 39:26.806
her music has inspired
so many of you,

39:26.873 --> 39:28.558
even if that
inspiration was

39:28.642 --> 39:29.842
brought about
by a dangerous narcotic.

39:29.893 --> 39:31.310
And I think

39:31.378 --> 39:34.313
we've all come to appreciate
her music and celebrity

39:34.381 --> 39:35.948
so much more this week.

39:36.016 --> 39:38.985
But honestly, she's just not us.

39:39.052 --> 39:40.236
I'm devastated.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.822
I can't believe we only
did one Britney number.

39:42.890 --> 39:44.056
RACH:
I was actually gonna do

39:44.108 --> 39:45.324
something from
our original assignment

39:45.392 --> 39:47.443
last week-- adult contemporary.

39:47.528 --> 39:50.196
But this is just
a little bit more young adult.

39:50.247 --> 39:51.280
Oh.

39:51.365 --> 39:52.398
Great, Rachel.

39:52.449 --> 39:53.499
Well, let's hear it.

39:57.904 --> 40:01.591
I'd like to dedicate this
song to my boyfriend Finn.

40:01.675 --> 40:03.676
I was wrong.

40:03.743 --> 40:05.711
I shouldn't try
to control you.

40:05.763 --> 40:08.848
I've just, I've never been
this happy before.

40:08.915 --> 40:10.516
And I realize that

40:10.584 --> 40:14.270
I was trying to hold onto how
you were making me feel so much,

40:14.354 --> 40:17.390
that I was strangling you in
my hands, like a little bird.

40:17.441 --> 40:19.025
I get now,
that in order for

40:19.092 --> 40:20.426
this relationship to work,

40:20.477 --> 40:23.896
I have to open up my hands
and let you fly free.

40:23.947 --> 40:24.763
Finn can fly?

40:25.983 --> 40:27.233
Really?
Wait, I thought I was

40:27.284 --> 40:28.901
the only one getting
the solos from now on.

40:28.952 --> 40:30.703
Next week, I'm going to be

40:30.770 --> 40:33.156
performing a musical number
by Kesha.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.074
