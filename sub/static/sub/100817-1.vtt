03:41.263 --> 03:45.702
<i>The people of the
world are more or less the same.</i>

03:45.735 --> 03:49.439
<i>Though we may come
in different shapes and colors,</i>

03:49.472 --> 03:52.875
<i>we all share
the same inheritance.</i>

03:52.909 --> 03:57.312
<i>And we all have our backstories
and our secrets.</i>

03:59.515 --> 04:03.419
<i>And so has Agnes,
walking her dogs on the beach.</i>

04:04.454 --> 04:06.689
<i>Soon her life will change,</i>

04:06.723 --> 04:10.225
<i>and the past will become
the present, again.</i>

04:12.929 --> 04:16.466
<i>Even though evolution
might seem to mature us,</i>

04:16.499 --> 04:18.534
<i>there are still
parts of our brain</i>

04:18.568 --> 04:20.837
<i>that belong
to our reptile ancestors.</i>

04:22.739 --> 04:26.643
<i>Although we've convinced
ourselves that hate, revenge,</i>

04:26.676 --> 04:29.379
<i>and nemesis belong to the past,</i>

04:29.412 --> 04:33.650
<i>our ancient ancestors' blood
still runs in our veins,</i>

04:34.951 --> 04:38.388
<i>whether we like it or not.</i>

05:14.991 --> 05:17.527
<i>Clara and Thomas...</i>

05:17.560 --> 05:21.296
are coming Thursday.

05:23.833 --> 05:25.768
Will you be home then?

05:27.704 --> 05:29.939
I'm in Altmaar
on Thursday.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.608
Oh, yes.

05:34.309 --> 05:35.945
Damn.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.658
Maybe it's just
for the best.

05:54.362 --> 05:56.364
Can't you just
tell me his name?

05:57.934 --> 06:00.503
The man that you love.

06:01.771 --> 06:05.608
His name's
Erich Neumann-Hansen,

06:05.641 --> 06:08.544
and he's sitting
right here next to me.

06:12.582 --> 06:14.484
Do you want another painkiller?

06:14.517 --> 06:16.619
I don't want anything.

06:16.652 --> 06:20.322
The doctor said you can take
as many as you want.

06:20.355 --> 06:22.892
I just want you to be happy.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.293
I want you to feel okay.

06:25.327 --> 06:27.430
And I don't want you to argue.

06:28.865 --> 06:31.768
I just find it strange...

06:33.669 --> 06:37.339
the way they start
turning up now.

06:37.372 --> 06:39.942
It's all that matters
to me, darling.

06:39.976 --> 06:42.512
That you don't argue.

06:42.545 --> 06:45.081
I don't argue.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.783
I know.

06:49.351 --> 06:53.990
Do you want me to prepare
some food for Thursday?

06:54.023 --> 06:56.025
Thomas can bring some Thai.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.503
I love you.

07:14.944 --> 07:16.479
I know.

07:29.125 --> 07:30.626
Keats, Byron.

07:41.971 --> 07:44.040
He always just...
money, money, money.

07:44.073 --> 07:46.642
He lives, breathes,
sleeps money.

07:46.676 --> 07:50.112
So I said to him, "Sure.
You've got the money, Frank.

07:50.146 --> 07:51.814
But you can't buy talent."

07:52.882 --> 07:54.150
At least not your own.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.552
Sorry.

07:56.586 --> 07:58.821
- Am I right?
- Yes, definitely.

07:58.855 --> 08:01.424
Oh, we need more wine in here.

08:01.457 --> 08:02.992
More wine, Henny.

08:04.827 --> 08:05.962
Henny?

08:14.003 --> 08:16.806
Right. Where was I?
Uh, love and talent.

08:16.839 --> 08:18.774
You can't do that.

08:18.808 --> 08:21.077
I hate it like that.
I'm not going.

08:21.110 --> 08:22.812
Simple as that.

08:22.845 --> 08:24.413
You would've done the same.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.853
And then, then they
wanted to transfer me

08:30.887 --> 08:35.558
to the head office in London,
and then the shit hit the fan.

08:35.591 --> 08:39.528
I mean, I just thought, "No,
not doing that. I've had enough."

08:39.562 --> 08:41.831
Career change for me,
within 12 months,

08:41.864 --> 08:43.933
I bought this beautiful home.

08:43.966 --> 08:46.836
I just said, "No, that's it.

08:46.869 --> 08:49.672
You can take your job and
you can stick it up your ass.

08:51.207 --> 08:54.810
I'm gonna be one of the best
TV producers in Europe."

08:54.844 --> 09:00.216
- How old are the girls now?
- Rea is ten and Betty is eight.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.818
Oh, big girls now.

09:02.852 --> 09:04.987
Haven't seen them in years.

09:05.021 --> 09:07.456
How are things for you?

09:07.490 --> 09:10.960
- For me?
- Are you working at all?

09:10.993 --> 09:13.462
I've a... I've got a few
things in the pipeline

09:13.496 --> 09:15.898
but nothing set
in stone as yet.

09:15.932 --> 09:17.700
I'm just the same.

09:17.733 --> 09:19.802
I don't take
anything for granted.

09:22.238 --> 09:24.874
So shall I come pick you up
later after riding, Betty?

09:24.907 --> 09:26.943
I can take the bus.

09:26.976 --> 09:29.245
Okay. So, I'll see you
at dinner, all right?

09:29.278 --> 09:30.780
Come on, Betty.
We have to run.

09:30.813 --> 09:32.782
- Bye, Mom.
- Kiss goodbye.

09:32.815 --> 09:34.984
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:40.823 --> 09:42.024
Come on.

09:45.294 --> 09:47.663
No, no, no, no, no.

09:47.697 --> 09:50.900
We can't accept that.

09:56.105 --> 09:59.942
No. Not a chance.

09:59.976 --> 10:03.646
Well, then I'll put
Vera Kaufmann on it instead.

10:03.679 --> 10:06.782
Yeah. Well, you know
what that means, don't we?

10:06.816 --> 10:10.853
So, do me favor, give her a
call, or even...

11:09.379 --> 11:10.946
All right.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.248
Well,
you stay strong, Agnes.

11:12.281 --> 11:13.749
I'm so sorry.

11:21.323 --> 11:22.892
God bless you.

11:31.934 --> 11:34.103
I'll go with Thomas instead.

11:34.136 --> 11:35.771
So, see you there?

11:35.805 --> 11:37.973
Yes. Suit yourself.

12:11.774 --> 12:15.978
Keep the...

12:16.011 --> 12:17.680
What are you talking about?

12:34.964 --> 12:37.166
Keep
everything, and then

12:37.199 --> 12:39.001
you could actually get a
separate house there and there.

12:39.034 --> 12:40.269
We could build two more houses.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.737
That's a horrible idea.

12:41.770 --> 12:42.972
We could easily get
part of the commission.

12:43.005 --> 12:44.340
- We're very close...
- No.

12:57.487 --> 13:00.756
It feels so strange
now that Dad's not here.

13:06.028 --> 13:09.365
How does it feel for you to be
completely alone in this big house?

13:10.433 --> 13:12.101
I'm not alone.

13:14.069 --> 13:17.840
Byron, Keats, food.

13:25.147 --> 13:27.783
What...
what difference does it make

13:27.816 --> 13:29.218
if I take it now or later?

13:29.251 --> 13:30.853
It's mine anyway.

13:30.886 --> 13:32.888
Let's wait until evaluation.

13:32.922 --> 13:36.393
Fine, fine.

13:36.426 --> 13:38.894
<i>"And thus
it follows that the estate,</i>

13:38.928 --> 13:40.930
<i>both banking deposits
and property</i>

13:40.963 --> 13:42.865
<i>with its inventory in Maardam,</i>

13:42.898 --> 13:46.135
shall be divided
into two equal parts.

13:46.168 --> 13:50.172
The first part will go to my
children, Clara and Thomas,

13:50.206 --> 13:52.875
and the other part
to my wife, Agnes.

13:52.908 --> 13:56.312
Being of sound mind, memory,
and understanding,

13:56.345 --> 13:58.013
Erich Neumann-Hansen."

13:59.449 --> 14:01.250
But hang on.

14:01.283 --> 14:05.388
What happened to the property
being left in marital trust?

14:05.422 --> 14:08.391
According to the law, if we were both
your children, that would be the case,

14:08.425 --> 14:12.294
but it just so happens
that we're not.

14:12.328 --> 14:16.799
Luckily... for us.

14:18.968 --> 14:25.408
Now, I know that these things
can take some time, but...

14:25.442 --> 14:28.110
both Clara and I would
appreciate it if all of this

14:28.143 --> 14:30.279
could be over and done with
as soon as possible.

14:34.384 --> 14:35.784
Clara.

14:37.454 --> 14:40.089
We'll stay in touch.

14:49.499 --> 14:52.101
I know you want to stay
in this house, Agnes.

14:52.134 --> 14:54.303
I know.

14:54.336 --> 14:58.307
But surely there's nothing to
prevent you from buying them out.

14:58.340 --> 15:01.810
Neither Clara nor Thomas
seem to want the house anyway.

15:01.844 --> 15:06.849
How can I ever afford to
on my salary?

15:20.029 --> 15:23.400
I had lunch with
Susanne Liebermann today.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.935
- Oh?
- Yeah.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.539
And it got a bit embarrassing

15:29.572 --> 15:32.875
when she asked
if you got that part.

15:32.908 --> 15:35.144
What part?

15:35.177 --> 15:37.980
That's exactly what I said.

15:38.013 --> 15:41.216
Apparently, you told her
that you had a gig on the go.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.385
Now, this autumn.

15:51.226 --> 15:53.962
It wouldn't have hurt
to tell me, would it?

15:53.996 --> 15:55.498
I felt like a right idiot.

15:57.266 --> 15:59.469
Okay.

15:59.502 --> 16:02.071
- "Okay"?
- What do you want me to say?

16:03.339 --> 16:04.873
Well, what gig
would it be, then?

16:06.308 --> 16:08.977
You know we're opening
a new office in Munich.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.080
I'm gonna be gone
most of the autumn.

16:11.113 --> 16:12.881
Henny?

16:12.915 --> 16:14.950
- Henny?
- Don't you get it?

16:14.983 --> 16:16.318
What is there to get?

16:16.352 --> 16:18.987
That things aren't
so fucking easy for me.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.290
What do you suggest
I should have said then?

16:29.466 --> 16:32.101
I'm going to bed.

16:42.177 --> 16:43.546
<i>Peter's a bastard.</i>

16:43.580 --> 16:45.147
You don't love him anymore.

16:46.549 --> 16:48.485
It's not that simple.

16:48.518 --> 16:52.187
Get a life of your own,
a job at the very least.

16:52.221 --> 16:55.090
Divorce that waste of space.

16:55.124 --> 16:57.059
Come on, it's not like
he can't afford it.

16:58.528 --> 17:00.262
You've always been so crass.

17:07.570 --> 17:09.938
I was at a funeral
the other day.

17:11.474 --> 17:13.443
Anything
for your own amusement.

17:17.212 --> 17:22.117
His name was
Erich Neumann-Hansen.

17:23.118 --> 17:24.454
Erich Neumann-who?

17:26.689 --> 17:28.425
He was married to Agnes.

17:29.426 --> 17:31.059
Agnes? Your Agnes?

17:35.030 --> 17:36.699
Shit.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.503
How was she?

17:40.537 --> 17:42.472
I don't know.

17:42.505 --> 17:44.339
What, you didn't ask her?

17:45.775 --> 17:47.242
Not really.

17:47.276 --> 17:49.512
What's wrong with you?

17:52.782 --> 17:56.251
You know, I never understood
what happened between you two.

17:58.588 --> 17:59.988
<i>Just to the right,</i>

18:00.022 --> 18:01.524
<i>just yellowish-brownish one.</i>

18:03.158 --> 18:06.763
Yes, I see it.
Very yellowish-brownish.

18:06.796 --> 18:09.364
That's a <i>Sphyrapicus varius.</i>
It's impossible.

18:09.399 --> 18:11.066
It's on the wrong side
of the Atlantic Ocean.

18:11.099 --> 18:14.604
- Somebody pinch me.
- No fucking way.

18:14.637 --> 18:17.239
What the hell
is he doing here?

18:17.272 --> 18:19.509
Have you seen any others,
any females?

18:19.542 --> 18:21.210
No.

18:21.243 --> 18:23.278
Cornell are gonna
hear about this.

18:23.312 --> 18:26.449
Please, don't fly away now.

18:26.483 --> 18:28.785
It doesn't look bothered.

18:28.818 --> 18:31.554
It's fucking brilliant.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.523
From now on, you better
come along every time, Agnes.

18:33.556 --> 18:35.224
Ah.

18:35.257 --> 18:36.759
Agnes...

18:36.793 --> 18:38.394
Agnes, are you paying attention?

18:38.428 --> 18:41.230
Yes.
<i>Sphyrapicus varius.</i>

18:41.263 --> 18:42.432
Shh. Shut up.

18:44.132 --> 18:47.369
Also known as
the yellow-bellied sapsucker.

18:48.805 --> 18:49.772
- Shit!
- Oh.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.274
Are you nuts?

18:52.307 --> 18:54.243
Do you realize
what you've just done?

18:54.276 --> 18:56.044
- No.
- What's going on?

18:56.078 --> 18:57.747
Better ask Agnes.

18:57.780 --> 19:00.617
Well, it turned out to be
a very yellow-bellied,

19:00.650 --> 19:02.452
yellow-bellied sapsucker.

19:02.485 --> 19:04.319
- Did you get him?
- No.

19:04.353 --> 19:07.055
Shit. Well, maybe
it was just a...

19:07.089 --> 19:09.291
a larger than normal
penduline tit or something.

19:09.324 --> 19:12.428
No way.
It was far too big to be a tit.

19:12.462 --> 19:16.265
But Ansgar, darling, you told me
tits could never be too big.

19:42.525 --> 19:45.628
For years, they've been
complete strangers,

19:45.662 --> 19:48.765
but ever since
Erich's diagnosis,

19:48.798 --> 19:51.300
it feels like they can't
get enough of the place.

19:52.735 --> 19:56.305
I think they'll get it,
and I'll be homeless.

19:58.641 --> 20:01.644
Thomas seems to have
a heart of stone.

20:01.678 --> 20:04.246
No wonder he's
an up-and-coming lawyer.

20:05.481 --> 20:08.350
And Clara,
I don't know. Tsk.

20:08.384 --> 20:11.521
She never puts
her foot down.

20:12.589 --> 20:15.658
A real yellow-belly.

20:17.727 --> 20:21.330
Proper yellow-bellied
sapsucker.

20:21.363 --> 20:23.165
She's a sap, all right.

20:28.905 --> 20:30.773
How about you?

20:30.807 --> 20:32.809
How are things?

20:32.842 --> 20:35.344
Are you still
in Grothenburg?

20:35.378 --> 20:39.247
Yeah, I...
I haven't worked in ages.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.385
I've been
looking after the girls,

20:42.418 --> 20:45.187
and Peter's always
tied up with something.

20:47.189 --> 20:49.492
What is he up to these days?

20:49.525 --> 20:54.464
He has a big production company.
They make film and TV.

20:55.832 --> 20:58.635
Sorry. May I have
some more wine, please?

20:58.668 --> 20:59.836
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Thank you.

21:11.346 --> 21:13.716
I think Peter's
cheating on me.

21:14.717 --> 21:17.887
Oh. I'm sorry.

21:20.556 --> 21:22.290
Do you know who?

21:24.326 --> 21:26.228
I don't want to know.

21:27.430 --> 21:28.631
Here we are.

21:29.632 --> 21:31.601
And anything for yourself?

21:31.634 --> 21:34.437
- No, thank you.
- Okay, enjoy.

21:34.470 --> 21:35.672
Thank you.

21:43.613 --> 21:45.448
My car's over there.

21:45.481 --> 21:48.384
I'm on my bike.

21:51.721 --> 21:54.356
It's been a long time.

22:07.904 --> 22:10.773
Can't we see
each other again soon?

22:10.807 --> 22:13.776
Yes, maybe.

22:15.645 --> 22:18.514
Okay. I'll be in touch.

22:18.548 --> 22:19.682
Okay.

22:43.371 --> 22:44.707
<i>I'm starving.</i>

22:44.741 --> 22:46.642
I need meat.

22:46.676 --> 22:48.611
Student loan
gets paid out on Monday.

22:50.446 --> 22:53.516
Agnes, if you hadn't gone
and spoiled everything,

22:53.549 --> 22:55.384
we could all be tucking into
a flame-grilled,

22:55.418 --> 22:57.587
yellow-bellied sapsucker by now.

22:57.620 --> 23:00.389
You really have the ability
to string out a joke.

23:00.423 --> 23:02.625
Apart from Ansgar, of course,
who might prefer to get

23:02.658 --> 23:04.994
his teeth stuck
into a big tit.

23:05.027 --> 23:06.696
Ouch.

23:06.729 --> 23:08.965
- Did you grab it?
- What?

23:08.998 --> 23:10.566
The bird watching notes.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.802
No. I thought you got them.

23:12.835 --> 23:17.073
- Oh, shit!
- Can you drive us home, please?

23:17.106 --> 23:18.808
Henny, I thought you were
gonna stay at my place tonight.

23:18.841 --> 23:21.077
I'm sorry, darling.
All this excitement's

23:21.110 --> 23:22.645
really taken it out of me.

23:22.678 --> 23:24.847
Me too.

23:24.881 --> 23:27.550
We'll drop you off
by the Botanical Gardens.

23:27.583 --> 23:28.951
What?

23:40.096 --> 23:43.866
Seriously, Henny,
we can't go on like this.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.602
I know.
How did we end up with

23:46.636 --> 23:48.471
the biggest
pair of tits in town?

23:48.504 --> 23:54.744
Speaking of tits,
look what I have.

23:54.777 --> 23:59.347
- Hmm?
- Oh, you beauty.

23:59.382 --> 24:01.651
I love you for this.

24:01.684 --> 24:03.653
Let's hide it.
It's getting dark.

24:03.686 --> 24:05.021
Let's hide it.
Here in the park.

24:12.428 --> 24:13.796
Here.

25:06.682 --> 25:10.119
Erich, he moved back

25:10.152 --> 25:14.757
from Kaalbringen
after his divorce.

25:19.128 --> 25:21.430
His father had just died,

25:21.464 --> 25:26.669
so... he inherited
the house.

25:28.070 --> 25:29.805
Let's go.

25:32.675 --> 25:35.111
Go!

25:45.021 --> 25:47.690
It's... Peter.

25:49.859 --> 25:52.428
Really, I know
I should leave him.

25:53.896 --> 25:56.032
I mean, he's chosen
someone else over me.

25:57.934 --> 26:00.603
Probably been several over the years.
What do I know?

26:03.172 --> 26:06.509
But I can't...
deal with it.

26:08.978 --> 26:12.515
For some reason,
I just... can't.

26:19.021 --> 26:20.523
Ahem.

26:22.558 --> 26:27.730
You know, I actually
began to envy you.

26:29.832 --> 26:34.170
What if it was me who'd
been left widowed instead?

26:35.705 --> 26:38.140
What if I had been you?

26:43.579 --> 26:49.485
If Peter happened to get
a terminal illness...

26:51.320 --> 26:54.657
leukemia, like Erich.

27:05.968 --> 27:08.004
Can you hear
what you're saying?

27:08.037 --> 27:10.573
I even think it'd be
easier for the kids.

27:14.643 --> 27:17.680
I can't quite let go
of that feeling.

27:17.713 --> 27:21.250
The envy and how much easier
everything would be.

27:22.718 --> 27:24.020
Christ, Henny.

27:24.053 --> 27:27.590
Is this some sort of fantasy,

27:27.623 --> 27:30.159
or is it just one
of your sick jokes?

27:30.192 --> 27:32.728
Have you seen the film
<i>Strangers on a Train?</i>

27:34.096 --> 27:35.798
Hitchcock.

27:35.831 --> 27:38.868
Two people meet on a train,
and they make a deal

27:38.901 --> 27:41.937
that each one will commit
a murder on behalf of the other.

27:41.971 --> 27:45.341
Swap murders,
both with watertight alibis.

27:45.374 --> 27:48.277
Why are you
telling me this?

27:48.310 --> 27:52.181
Because I realize I'm the
first person they'd suspect.

27:52.214 --> 27:54.917
Suspect? Oh...

27:59.622 --> 28:03.793
So now you want me
to kill your husband.

28:07.897 --> 28:10.266
I've been thinking
since we last saw each other.

28:10.299 --> 28:12.101
You need cash, right?

28:12.134 --> 28:15.838
Well, money isn't a problem.
After Mom's will, I...

28:15.871 --> 28:18.307
Tell me
you're fucking joking.

28:18.340 --> 28:19.809
If you do this for me,

28:19.842 --> 28:21.610
I'll make sure
you can keep the house.

28:21.644 --> 28:22.878
No one would suspect you.

28:22.912 --> 28:24.313
You're sick.

28:25.347 --> 28:27.183
Please, Agnes!

28:27.216 --> 28:29.685
Get help!

28:50.940 --> 28:52.741
Henny!

28:54.877 --> 28:57.813
My time has finally come.

28:57.847 --> 29:00.316
Say hello,
to the new Cordelia!

29:00.349 --> 29:01.917
Cordelia?

29:01.951 --> 29:03.386
Is Groschmann doing <i>Lear?</i>

29:03.420 --> 29:05.054
Yeah. He's here now!

29:05.087 --> 29:06.722
- Here?
- Yes.

29:06.755 --> 29:09.258
- Where?
- Oh, fuck off!

29:10.393 --> 29:12.161
He arrived yesterday.

29:12.194 --> 29:13.796
And next week,

29:13.829 --> 29:16.699
they're holding auditions
at the Kellerteater!

29:16.732 --> 29:19.268
So, you have
to help me, Henny.

29:19.301 --> 29:21.971
I really want
to get this part.

29:22.004 --> 29:23.739
So, you have to do
lines with me.

29:23.772 --> 29:25.741
I'll do anything for you.
You know that.

29:25.774 --> 29:31.714
I mean, he's Mr. "Everything
I Touch Turns into Gold" Groschmann.

29:31.747 --> 29:34.049
So, this is
a chance of a lifetime.

29:34.083 --> 29:37.319
You've met him, haven't you?
What's he like?

29:39.889 --> 29:43.893
Wow. We had
a wonderful night.

29:43.926 --> 29:48.931
Like one of these nights
where two souls merge into one.

29:48.964 --> 29:52.435
- Oh, stop!
- And then...

29:52.469 --> 29:54.737
Stop!

29:54.770 --> 29:56.406
No, we only had
half an hour together

29:56.439 --> 30:01.043
during that interview, but...
he's special, you know?

30:01.076 --> 30:03.712
- Mm-hmm.
- He sort of stays with you.

30:09.419 --> 30:11.053
Ready?

30:15.224 --> 30:20.996
"If he be taken,
I shall nevermore be feared of doing harm.

30:21.030 --> 30:26.302
Make your own purpose.
How in my strength you please.

30:26.335 --> 30:28.904
For you, Edmond."

30:30.139 --> 30:34.143
"In the good man is distress.

30:34.176 --> 30:36.879
Seek, seek for him..."

30:38.548 --> 30:43.085
- "Lest his..."
- "Lest his..."

30:43.118 --> 30:45.754
"Ungoverned rage
dissolve the life."

30:45.788 --> 30:49.158
"Ungoverned rage
dissolve the life."

30:49.191 --> 30:51.927
Ahem. "News, madam.

30:51.961 --> 30:54.363
The British powers
are marching hitherward."

30:54.397 --> 30:56.799
<i>When I saw you in Cafe Intrigo,</i>

30:56.832 --> 30:58.468
<i>it was as if time
had stood still.</i>

31:00.236 --> 31:03.772
<i>And I realized how much
I've missed you.</i>

31:03.806 --> 31:08.478
<i>Your laughter.
Your way of telling a story.</i>

31:08.511 --> 31:11.548
<i>You're one in a million, Agnes.</i>

31:11.581 --> 31:14.551
<i>I've understood that you're not
interested in my proposal,</i>

31:14.584 --> 31:17.052
<i>and I respect that.</i>

31:17.086 --> 31:20.956
<i>But I hope you might
still want to see me,</i>

31:20.990 --> 31:25.528
<i>and that, just maybe,
you've missed me, too.</i>

31:27.229 --> 31:28.565
<i>I'll never forget that year</i>

31:28.598 --> 31:31.066
<i>we spent together
in Frau Bloeme's house.</i>

31:31.100 --> 31:33.536
<i>Me, struggling
with my boring Sociology,</i>

31:33.570 --> 31:35.237
<i>and you with your Literature,</i>

31:35.271 --> 31:38.007
<i>longing for your family
back in Italy.</i>

31:38.040 --> 31:40.142
<i>Although it was tough
for both of us,</i>

31:40.175 --> 31:42.778
<i>it was the happiest
time of my life.</i>

31:43.879 --> 31:45.814
Shh.

31:45.848 --> 31:49.386
<i>Dear Agnes,
couldn't we just start over?</i>

32:23.986 --> 32:29.058
<i>"...furrow-weeds,
with burr-docks, hemlock,</i>

32:29.091 --> 32:33.563
nettles, cuckoo-flowers, Darnel,

32:33.596 --> 32:35.964
and all the idle weeds

32:35.998 --> 32:39.536
that grow
in our sustaining corn.

32:39.569 --> 32:42.505
A century send forth.

32:42.539 --> 32:47.176
Search every acre
in the high-grown field,

32:47.209 --> 32:49.479
and bring him to our eye.

32:49.512 --> 32:53.215
What can a man's wisdom..."

32:53.248 --> 32:54.484
Sorry, sorry, I forgot.

32:54.517 --> 32:56.352
Um, this is when
the officer exits.

33:04.694 --> 33:10.299
"What can a man's wisdom,
in his bereaved..."

33:10.332 --> 33:13.001
Hold on a minute.
Um, now he's gone.

33:13.035 --> 33:15.638
Um, would she carry on
in exactly the same way?

33:15.672 --> 33:17.940
What do you mean?

33:17.973 --> 33:19.676
I think there can be
some kind of break here.

33:19.709 --> 33:22.010
Well, I'm doing
the audition, not you,

33:22.044 --> 33:24.113
and I want Cordelia
to be strong.

33:25.347 --> 33:26.649
Surely she can be strong

33:26.683 --> 33:28.083
without talking
in such a loud voice.

33:28.117 --> 33:30.152
Yes, but it's
a classical theatrical text,

33:30.185 --> 33:32.087
so it's crying out
to be interpreted.

33:32.121 --> 33:34.457
And we're not doing documentary
for the History Channel.

33:34.491 --> 33:36.526
All right. I just meant you could
find a slightly different...

33:36.559 --> 33:38.160
And surely that's why

33:38.193 --> 33:40.095
Groschmann is coming here.

33:40.129 --> 33:44.266
To see how Cordelia
can be interpreted, right?

33:44.299 --> 33:46.969
- Yeah. But...
- And this is my interpretation.

33:49.004 --> 33:51.708
I mean, I hope
I'm better than Louise.

33:51.741 --> 33:54.910
- God, yes.
- And that other girl.

33:56.379 --> 33:58.247
- Are they auditioning as well?
- Yeah.

33:59.516 --> 34:03.285
- They are.
- Hmm.

34:03.318 --> 34:04.687
But it could be
interesting,

34:04.721 --> 34:07.356
I guess, for Groschmann.

34:07.390 --> 34:10.092
I mean, Louise has,
given talentlessness,

34:10.125 --> 34:12.729
a brand-new face, no?

34:12.762 --> 34:16.198
- Put it on the map.
- Raised the bar.

34:16.231 --> 34:18.435
- That low.
- That low.

34:21.170 --> 34:25.542
You have to come along tomorrow
for moral support.

34:25.575 --> 34:28.210
- Of course I will.
- Thank you.

34:36.185 --> 34:38.987
Think he'll remember me?

34:39.021 --> 34:40.255
Who?

34:41.758 --> 34:45.662
Groschmann.

34:45.695 --> 34:49.031
You know, I heard he came here
only to be close to you.

34:50.433 --> 34:56.138
He couldn't get Henny
Delgado out of his head.

34:56.171 --> 35:01.478
So, the play at the Kellerteater
is all because of you.

35:03.078 --> 35:04.447
I believe it.

35:25.067 --> 35:26.402
Hello?

35:28.805 --> 35:31.273
Johann Clausen.
Real estate agency.

35:31.306 --> 35:32.675
It's nice to meet you.

35:32.709 --> 35:34.611
What a fantastic place
you have here.

35:34.644 --> 35:36.278
It's totally unique.

35:36.311 --> 35:38.715
I can just imagine the bidding
this place would attract.

35:38.748 --> 35:40.249
Hello, Agnes.

35:41.518 --> 35:43.486
I'm just going
to look outside.

35:46.623 --> 35:49.559
Thomas.
Agnes is here now.

35:49.592 --> 35:54.062
You know, I almost worked
that out entirely by myself.

35:54.096 --> 35:55.230
Agnes?

36:01.704 --> 36:04.373
I'm just wondering what kind of
timeframe we're working with.

36:04.407 --> 36:06.509
When do you want this in the market?
The most important thing

36:06.543 --> 36:08.578
is that we get
the highest price for it.

36:08.611 --> 36:10.413
The highest price,
as soon as possible.

36:10.446 --> 36:11.581
When are you guys
ready to... ready to move?

36:11.614 --> 36:14.651
- Now.
- Now?

36:14.684 --> 36:19.221
<i>And so apart from
deductions for loans and other costs,</i>

36:19.254 --> 36:24.427
you'll have to pay Clara
and Thomas 500,000 Euro

36:24.460 --> 36:27.162
if you want to buy them out.

36:27.195 --> 36:32.669
Give or take 20,000, depending
on the new valuation.

36:34.871 --> 36:37.407
I cannot manage that.

36:38.474 --> 36:41.076
I spoke to the bank yesterday.

36:42.812 --> 36:44.714
I'm sorry, Agnes.

36:46.214 --> 36:48.283
This is just
how things stand.

36:49.819 --> 36:52.120
You-you have to understand
the children as well.

36:53.456 --> 36:56.426
They don't want to wait
for their money.

36:57.427 --> 36:59.796
Yes. So I understand.

37:03.298 --> 37:08.571
Please wait a few days...
before telling them.

37:11.874 --> 37:13.443
Okay.

37:14.877 --> 37:18.581
- I will call you.
- When you're ready.

37:26.522 --> 37:28.357
- Peter?
- Hmm?

37:29.792 --> 37:32.462
I'd like to start over.

37:35.632 --> 37:38.835
Move to a bigger town,
where I can find a job.

37:40.403 --> 37:42.337
Get to know some new people.

37:53.950 --> 37:55.485
Hey...

37:58.253 --> 38:00.456
Maybe you could
run the new office.

38:02.492 --> 38:04.927
I always wanted
to live in Munich.

38:17.372 --> 38:19.374
I'll talk to Gosser.

38:21.010 --> 38:23.579
He owes me a favor anyway.

38:26.248 --> 38:28.751
Maybe he can get you
into something here.

38:30.453 --> 38:32.588
Karl-Heinz Theater.

39:35.752 --> 39:37.920
Why don't you
just hire a professional

39:37.954 --> 39:39.655
if you have so much money?

39:41.624 --> 39:43.593
Why come to me?

39:45.862 --> 39:48.231
Actually,
it's completely on impulse.

39:49.732 --> 39:51.467
I was thinking of that film

39:51.501 --> 39:54.036
and how we could
actually help each other.

39:57.840 --> 40:00.042
How much are you
prepared to pay?

40:03.379 --> 40:04.747
How much do you want?

40:08.350 --> 40:10.987
Three-hundred thousand,
minimum.

40:11.020 --> 40:14.289
I'll give you 400,
minimum.

40:16.759 --> 40:19.796
This is really insane, Henny.

40:26.636 --> 40:28.704
Fine.

40:35.711 --> 40:38.714
How do you imagine
this can be done?

40:50.426 --> 40:51.961
Let's go outside.

40:56.966 --> 41:02.705
He looks just the same...
despite everything.

41:02.738 --> 41:04.640
There are
more pictures inside.

41:06.642 --> 41:09.078
You have to know what
he looks like nowadays.

41:19.088 --> 41:22.058
I have an identical one.

41:22.091 --> 41:25.695
I've put prepaid cards on both
and saved our numbers.

41:25.728 --> 41:27.697
You mustn't use it
for anything else.

41:28.965 --> 41:30.533
Okay.

41:31.901 --> 41:33.502
An advance.

41:34.637 --> 41:36.439
A hundred and fifty grand.

41:47.049 --> 41:50.887
I'll be in touch about dates
and all that, okay?

42:12.541 --> 42:15.578
Yes. Ooh.

44:33.949 --> 44:36.619
<i>After returning
to England in 1811,</i>

44:36.652 --> 44:38.687
he got down to work

44:38.721 --> 44:42.124
on what would eventually
become <i>Childe Harold.</i>

44:43.393 --> 44:47.196
What would you say
sets this work apart?

44:53.769 --> 44:57.239
I think it was written
in Spenserian meter.

44:57.273 --> 44:58.941
And what is that?

45:01.644 --> 45:04.747
Old metrical form.

45:04.780 --> 45:06.248
How old?

45:07.783 --> 45:10.853
1600s?

45:10.886 --> 45:13.322
1500s.

45:13.355 --> 45:18.094
Iambic pentameter followed
by a single alexandrine.

45:24.133 --> 45:25.835
Are you all right?

45:28.137 --> 45:30.306
You'll have to excuse me.

45:52.261 --> 45:55.364
- Yes.
- <i>I can't do it.</i>

45:56.832 --> 46:01.170
This is madness.
I couldn't live with myself.

46:01.203 --> 46:04.807
- <i>If that's how you feel.</i>
- Yes, that's how I feel.

46:04.840 --> 46:07.776
- <i>Right. It was a stupid idea.</i>
- Yes, it was.

46:09.446 --> 46:11.213
- <i>So forget about it then.</i>
- Good.

46:11.247 --> 46:13.416
We'll forget
it ever came up, Henny.

46:15.317 --> 46:17.119
Okay.

46:17.153 --> 46:18.888
<i>Just give me
your bank account and I'll...</i>

46:18.921 --> 46:21.857
<i>I'll return your money.</i>

46:21.891 --> 46:24.160
No, no.
That won't work.

46:24.193 --> 46:26.295
It would look very strange.

46:26.328 --> 46:29.365
I had to mess about quite a bit
to take out that much cash.

46:29.399 --> 46:31.167
<i>So what do we do?</i>

46:31.200 --> 46:33.335
<i>Next Thursday at 11:00,</i>

46:33.369 --> 46:35.204
<i>the Motorway Service Cafe.</i>

46:35.237 --> 46:36.739
<i>Can you make it?</i>

46:36.772 --> 46:39.208
I'll manage.

46:48.184 --> 46:51.820
Oh, by the way,
I had a chat with Gosser.

46:51.854 --> 46:53.423
He's practically
gave me his word

46:53.456 --> 46:55.157
that he'd get you a part.

46:56.393 --> 46:59.028
Some Ibsen play
or something.

47:03.533 --> 47:05.367
I thought you'd be happy.

47:05.402 --> 47:07.970
What? Because you persuaded
a mate of yours

47:08.003 --> 47:10.139
to get me a minor part
in some play

47:10.172 --> 47:11.941
you don't even know
the title of?

47:13.410 --> 47:16.446
Anyone else would leap
at the opportunity.

47:16.479 --> 47:18.415
Not me.

47:23.420 --> 47:26.322
So call him and tell him
it's off then, yeah?

47:27.923 --> 47:29.124
Yeah.

47:30.125 --> 47:32.761
I don't need your help.

47:37.233 --> 47:38.801
Suit yourself.

47:53.849 --> 47:55.918
Oh, you really
do have green fingers,

47:55.951 --> 47:58.421
or whatever it's called.

47:59.955 --> 48:02.091
Thank you.

48:02.124 --> 48:04.427
So...

48:04.461 --> 48:06.262
I have the valuation.

48:08.998 --> 48:10.966
A little bit more
than we expected.

48:12.234 --> 48:13.335
It's quite a bit more,
actually.

48:13.369 --> 48:15.438
I want you to leave.

48:15.472 --> 48:19.975
This is still my house
and my garden.

48:20.009 --> 48:24.146
Agnes, half of this
is still yours.

48:24.179 --> 48:27.349
The other half
belongs to me and to Clara.

48:30.520 --> 48:34.023
Very soon now, the whole house
is going to be sold.

48:34.056 --> 48:35.891
I said go away.

48:40.530 --> 48:42.131
Do you think I don't know?

48:42.164 --> 48:45.568
Do you think I don't know
how you used my dad,

48:45.602 --> 48:47.303
that you were seeing others

48:47.336 --> 48:50.205
from the very second you knew
he was terminally ill?

48:50.239 --> 48:52.509
I don't understand
why he didn't kick you out.

48:52.542 --> 48:56.513
And who would've looked
after him in his final days?

48:57.547 --> 48:59.382
You and Clara?

49:00.983 --> 49:05.988
You know nothing about
what Erich and I had together.

49:07.557 --> 49:11.561
I know that you never
loved my dad.

49:13.228 --> 49:17.099
I'm picking up my photo albums
from my childhood.

49:18.300 --> 49:20.503
They're hardly yours,
are they?

49:20.537 --> 49:24.173
No.

49:55.672 --> 49:58.073
I want to keep the house.

50:02.445 --> 50:05.080
In that case,
we have to continue with our plan.

50:06.483 --> 50:08.350
No more messing about.

50:10.487 --> 50:12.321
But how do we do it?

50:13.523 --> 50:16.225
What's your thinking?

50:16.258 --> 50:19.429
It feels so unreal,
somehow.

50:27.169 --> 50:29.639
Do you remember
the bird link?

50:29.672 --> 50:33.142
Ansgar and...

50:33.175 --> 50:35.678
Klaus-Joseph.

50:41.250 --> 50:44.253
I'll see you there
in 45 minutes.

50:44.286 --> 50:46.389
Turnoff towards
the little bridge.

51:18.120 --> 51:20.490
<i>I inherited them from dad.</i>

51:20.523 --> 51:22.692
<i>I think they're from the war.</i>

51:22.725 --> 51:24.627
<i>Anyway, impossible to trace.</i>

51:24.661 --> 51:26.361
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

51:30.400 --> 51:35.170
So you want me
to shoot him?

51:37.072 --> 51:40.376
It's completely up to you.

51:40.410 --> 51:43.345
Rather do it another way,
that's fine by me.

51:43.379 --> 51:47.082
No, no.
It's fine.

51:47.115 --> 51:49.151
I've never handled a gun.

51:51.053 --> 51:53.088
Nor have I.

51:53.121 --> 51:55.057
Well, hardly.

51:56.426 --> 51:58.327
It can't be
that difficult.

51:59.729 --> 52:04.199
You'll have to practice...
in a forest or something.

52:04.233 --> 52:05.735
Yeah.

52:11.173 --> 52:13.409
Peter is always going off
on conference trips.

52:13.443 --> 52:15.512
So, I'll check his calendar.

52:18.581 --> 52:21.584
It has to be synchronized
with what I'm doing.

52:21.618 --> 52:24.086
- Mm-hmm.
- Need a watertight alibi.

52:25.287 --> 52:29.091
I can't just be
home with the children.

52:29.124 --> 52:30.259
That wouldn't be enough.

52:31.828 --> 52:34.631
Look, Henny...

52:37.800 --> 52:40.369
why don't you just leave him?

52:42.505 --> 52:44.674
It doesn't make sense.

52:46.174 --> 52:47.477
It doesn't.

52:47.510 --> 52:48.845
Because I know deep down

52:48.878 --> 52:51.146
that's exactly what
he wants me to do.

52:53.416 --> 52:56.051
And I'm not gonna
give him the satisfaction.

53:10.600 --> 53:12.835
And you?
How did it go for you?

53:12.869 --> 53:16.539
Yeah.
He didn't get it at all.

53:16.573 --> 53:18.441
He thought
it was going great.

53:18.474 --> 53:20.743
Same thing with Ansgar.
Clueless, basically.

53:20.777 --> 53:21.744
Two tequilas,
salt and lemon.

53:21.778 --> 53:23.211
Good day for tequila.

53:23.245 --> 53:25.180
Yes. Like that, it is.

53:25.213 --> 53:26.749
We have to celebrate,
don't we?

53:26.783 --> 53:28.451
Finally,
it's just the two of us.

53:28.484 --> 53:30.853
Mm.
Pity we're not gay.

53:30.887 --> 53:34.524
- Mm...
- Imagine how much easier life would be.

53:34.557 --> 53:36.859
But I love you.
You know that.

53:36.893 --> 53:39.862
Yeah, of course.
And I love you.

53:44.166 --> 53:45.133
<i>Voilá.</i>

53:47.770 --> 53:50.172
Thank you.

53:50.205 --> 53:51.340
Come on, then.

53:54.744 --> 53:57.547
We should go away together
once all this is over.

54:01.316 --> 54:03.686
Italy, maybe.

54:05.755 --> 54:07.657
Firenze.

54:13.396 --> 54:15.832
Now we won't see
each other for a bit.

54:21.871 --> 54:23.205
I'll wait till you've gone.

54:32.247 --> 54:34.216
<i>"Tis known before.</i>

54:34.249 --> 54:38.521
<i>Our preparation stands
in expectation of them.</i>

54:38.554 --> 54:40.390
<i>O dear father!</i>

54:40.423 --> 54:43.225
<i>It is thy business
that I go about.</i>

54:43.258 --> 54:45.728
Therefore great France...

54:47.397 --> 54:52.735
my mourning
and important tears hath pitied.

54:52.769 --> 54:57.940
No blown ambition
doth our arms incite.

54:57.974 --> 55:01.844
But love, dear love

55:01.878 --> 55:04.981
and our ag'd father's right.

55:05.014 --> 55:09.251
Soon may I hear and see him."

55:09.284 --> 55:10.386
Bravo.

55:11.387 --> 55:12.622
It's, uh, um...

55:14.991 --> 55:16.926
It's Agnes, isn't it?

55:18.594 --> 55:20.563
Yes.

55:20.596 --> 55:23.298
And you did Masha
in <i>The Three Sisters?</i>

55:23.331 --> 55:26.736
Yes, last spring.

55:26.769 --> 55:27.804
Did you like her?

55:27.837 --> 55:29.839
I liked her very much.

55:29.872 --> 55:31.941
Both her and the role.

55:31.974 --> 55:33.843
Chekhov, eh?

55:33.876 --> 55:37.279
The man who wouldn't
listen to his doctors.

55:37.312 --> 55:40.450
It's a bit too mainstream for
me, but great fun, I'm sure.

55:40.483 --> 55:41.918
Thank you.

55:41.951 --> 55:44.921
And thank you all, ladies,
for wonderful performances.

55:44.954 --> 55:48.458
It's just too bad there
can be only one Cordelia.

55:48.491 --> 55:50.927
I'll let you know
either way tomorrow morning.

55:50.960 --> 55:52.895
Noon at the latest.
That's a wrap.

55:52.929 --> 55:55.363
Oh, yes,
and before you leave,

55:55.398 --> 55:57.600
anyone interested in reading
for Goneril or Regan,

55:57.633 --> 56:00.837
be here tomorrow evening,
filling that. Thanks, again.

56:00.870 --> 56:02.772
Terrific stuff.
Terrific.

56:02.805 --> 56:04.674
So you've met him
before, right?

56:04.707 --> 56:06.676
Interviewed him for the
student magazine last year.

56:06.709 --> 56:09.311
Yeah.
He's just amazing.

56:09.344 --> 56:10.780
Not that ugly either.

56:12.782 --> 56:13.883
Yeah, that's true.

56:16.753 --> 56:18.454
Do you guys wanna
tag along for beer?

56:18.488 --> 56:19.756
- Sure.
- I don't know about you,

56:19.789 --> 56:22.658
- I think I need three.
- Let's go. Come on.

56:22.692 --> 56:25.027
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah. Of course.

56:27.329 --> 56:28.397
Yes.

56:30.365 --> 56:31.734
I don't think
I did very well, you know.

56:31.768 --> 56:33.335
Oh, no, you were great.

56:34.771 --> 56:37.640
Well, hardly made much
of an impression there.

56:39.475 --> 56:43.012
- He didn't recognize you?
- Not in the least.

56:43.045 --> 56:45.615
Even though I gave him
my most winning smile.

56:48.117 --> 56:50.753
Christ. What a drag.

56:52.488 --> 56:56.559
Still, you did Cordelia
the way you see her.

56:59.862 --> 57:02.465
What do you mean,
the way I see her?

57:04.600 --> 57:06.803
How else
should I have done it?

57:07.970 --> 57:10.006
No, I just meant

57:10.039 --> 57:13.409
you can afford
to be proud of yourself.

57:13.442 --> 57:14.977
Hey, let's go to Gunthers.

57:15.011 --> 57:16.813
That's a good idea.
Do you wanna come?

57:16.846 --> 57:17.947
Come on, let's go.

57:17.980 --> 57:19.782
Come on,
let's have a beer.

57:19.816 --> 57:22.652
I don't know.
I think I'll head off home.

57:22.685 --> 57:25.320
Yeah, right.
Stop messing about.

57:32.795 --> 57:34.997
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

57:37.466 --> 57:39.802
I'm gonna go. Okay?

57:39.836 --> 57:41.369
Okay.

57:43.739 --> 57:46.542
Oh, come on...
Let's go. Let's go.

57:46.576 --> 57:48.744
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

57:48.778 --> 57:50.780
- Hey, ladies.
- Yes.

58:22.879 --> 58:24.480
- Hello.
- Hi.

58:33.155 --> 58:34.757
Have you decided?

58:34.790 --> 58:36.859
Mm... mm-mm.

58:41.497 --> 58:42.865
You have a good look.

58:46.636 --> 58:50.172
- For Cordelia.
- Thank you.

58:51.207 --> 58:52.942
Would you like
a glass of wine?

58:55.044 --> 58:56.178
Red or white?

58:57.179 --> 58:59.615
- Red.
- Excuse me.

59:02.585 --> 59:03.753
Yes, please.

59:03.786 --> 59:05.755
Can we have two glasses
of red, please?

59:05.788 --> 59:06.923
Yes.

59:11.994 --> 59:13.963
Aww, it's closed, guys.

59:13.996 --> 59:15.631
So where do we go now?

59:15.665 --> 59:18.801
So... do you intend
on pursuing it?

59:19.835 --> 59:21.737
- The theater?
- Yeah.

59:24.040 --> 59:25.508
Maybe.

59:25.541 --> 59:28.511
I guess stranger things
have happened.

59:29.779 --> 59:32.214
Then I'll speak
to some people.

59:32.248 --> 59:36.118
Give you some names,
good names, good schools.

59:37.553 --> 59:38.821
If you're interested,
I mean.

59:40.022 --> 59:42.124
Yes, I really am.

59:42.158 --> 59:43.693
Thank you.

59:43.726 --> 59:45.928
Would you like to do
all sorts of acting...

59:45.962 --> 59:48.965
television, film, theater?

59:48.998 --> 59:51.667
I like theater.

59:51.701 --> 59:53.069
You prefer theater?

59:54.704 --> 59:56.706
Oh, wow,
that's really...

59:56.739 --> 59:58.274
This is a really nice place.
Well done.

59:58.307 --> 1:00:00.810
You know, we could
go out back somewhere.

1:00:00.843 --> 1:00:02.712
Think I just changed
my mind.

1:00:30.072 --> 1:00:33.576
- Can I have a drag?
- Sure.

1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:39.682
You can't stay,
you know.

1:00:41.283 --> 1:00:43.919
I've got a big day tomorrow.
I need to sleep.

1:00:45.588 --> 1:00:48.190
And as long as
you're in touching distance,

1:00:48.224 --> 1:00:51.127
that's gonna make it
very difficult.

1:00:53.763 --> 1:00:55.631
Absolutely.

1:01:08.310 --> 1:01:10.246
Do you know I've been
approached many times

1:01:10.279 --> 1:01:12.782
to direct
at the Kellerteater?

1:01:12.815 --> 1:01:14.884
It's never
quite worked out.

1:01:17.953 --> 1:01:19.889
I'm glad it has
this time, though.

1:01:21.857 --> 1:01:23.793
This is the first time
Shakespeare's ever been done there,

1:01:23.826 --> 1:01:24.960
you know that?

1:01:27.863 --> 1:01:29.965
So you'll be in touch
tomorrow?

1:01:29.999 --> 1:01:32.268
Before 12:00.
Promise.

1:02:42.104 --> 1:02:43.973
<i>Hi, this is
Peter Groschmann.</i>

1:02:44.006 --> 1:02:46.675
<i>I can't come to the phone right
now so please leave a message.</i>

1:02:51.448 --> 1:02:54.016
On the balcony?
Why?

1:02:55.718 --> 1:02:57.286
Oh, hold on a second.
Yes, dear?

1:02:57.319 --> 1:02:58.988
You seen Henny today?

1:02:59.021 --> 1:03:02.191
Uh, uh, she left in a hurry
a couple of hours ago.

1:03:02.224 --> 1:03:04.226
And what happened then?

1:03:04.260 --> 1:03:06.896
What was he doing
there then?

1:03:13.403 --> 1:03:15.337
God...

1:03:21.177 --> 1:03:25.247
It's half past 1:00.
Why haven't you called?

1:03:25.281 --> 1:03:28.451
Ah, sorry, I had to make some
chops and changes this morning.

1:03:28.485 --> 1:03:32.021
Really?
Have you decided?

1:03:32.054 --> 1:03:34.690
Yes, I have, actually.
It's Henny Delgado here.

1:03:43.866 --> 1:03:47.036
But we really need a Goneril,
so maybe you can play that part.

1:03:47.069 --> 1:03:49.138
You're gonna need to...

1:03:50.239 --> 1:03:52.141
Agnes?

1:03:52.174 --> 1:03:54.009
Okay.

1:03:54.043 --> 1:03:57.279
We'll be rehearsing daytimes
for the first three weeks,

1:03:57.313 --> 1:03:59.949
and then a week before,
get in the theater...

1:04:23.906 --> 1:04:25.174
Agnes?

1:04:57.039 --> 1:04:59.376
Yes, she left.

1:04:59.409 --> 1:05:01.944
I'm as surprised
as you are, dear.

1:05:01.977 --> 1:05:04.079
She packed everything
in an hour.

1:05:04.113 --> 1:05:06.815
I asked her
if something had happened,

1:05:06.849 --> 1:05:09.084
but she just thanked me
for everything,

1:05:09.118 --> 1:05:10.853
and then she was on her way.

1:05:14.457 --> 1:05:16.992
<i>Well, I think it's
almost too good to be true.</i>

1:05:18.093 --> 1:05:20.062
But I've done my sums,

1:05:20.095 --> 1:05:21.363
and it's going to be fine.

1:05:21.398 --> 1:05:22.931
Excellent.

1:05:22.965 --> 1:05:24.166
Who would ever
have thought a banker

1:05:24.199 --> 1:05:26.101
was capable
of changing his mind?

1:05:26.135 --> 1:05:28.538
One would think
it was against their nature.

1:05:28.571 --> 1:05:30.172
As I said earlier,

1:05:30.205 --> 1:05:32.442
Clara and Thomas want
this whole thing

1:05:32.475 --> 1:05:35.177
to be over and done with
as soon as possible.

1:05:35.210 --> 1:05:38.481
The transaction has to be
finalized at the end of the month.

1:05:38.515 --> 1:05:41.584
At the end of the month.

1:05:41.618 --> 1:05:44.487
Good. I'll let
the bank know.

1:05:44.521 --> 1:05:46.221
And I will speak
to the children.

1:05:48.123 --> 1:05:49.526
<i>"In her first passion,</i>

1:05:49.559 --> 1:05:51.226
a woman loves her lover,

1:05:51.260 --> 1:05:54.531
and all the others,
all she loves is love."

1:05:56.965 --> 1:05:59.402
Thank you.

1:06:05.174 --> 1:06:08.611
"A mistress never is
nor can be a friend.

1:06:08.645 --> 1:06:11.347
While you agree,
you are lovers.

1:06:11.381 --> 1:06:14.983
And when it is over,
anything but friends."

1:09:47.195 --> 1:09:48.565
Morning.

1:09:49.832 --> 1:09:52.234
- I would like to buy a wig.
- Okay.

1:10:05.415 --> 1:10:07.115
Shh.

1:10:22.164 --> 1:10:23.566
<i>There will be,
like, eight of us,</i>

1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:25.468
<i>and remember,
Wasserman's a vegetarian</i>

1:10:25.501 --> 1:10:27.704
so you might have to make
a salad or something.

1:10:27.737 --> 1:10:31.373
Yes, I know.
I can make a gratin.

1:10:31.407 --> 1:10:35.177
And then there's a conference
in Linden, 25th, 26th, 27th.

1:10:35.210 --> 1:10:36.546
Might have to go in the 24th,

1:10:36.579 --> 1:10:38.246
but I won't know
until a week before.

1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:40.248
And where will you
be staying?

1:10:40.282 --> 1:10:41.818
Silverling House, I presume.

1:10:41.851 --> 1:10:44.252
That's where she usually
books me into.

1:10:44.286 --> 1:10:46.254
Why do you ask?

1:10:46.288 --> 1:10:48.323
I just want to know
where you are.

1:10:49.692 --> 1:10:50.927
That's the same weekend

1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:54.196
I'll be at that workshop
in Saarendorf.

1:10:54.229 --> 1:10:55.531
What workshop?

1:10:56.532 --> 1:10:58.300
Fine, I'll talk to Benji.

1:10:58.333 --> 1:11:00.235
The girls could stay
with him while I'm away.

1:11:04.272 --> 1:11:06.208
And then it's Vienna.

1:11:06.241 --> 1:11:08.276
I know. Exactly.

1:11:08.310 --> 1:11:11.279
I'll just be getting home and
then I'll have to leave again.

1:11:14.450 --> 1:11:17.854
I tried to cancel it this year,
but they didn't want to listen.

1:11:17.887 --> 1:11:19.522
They were planning to do some sort of...

1:11:21.958 --> 1:11:24.560
<i>I think I speak
for everyone</i> in this room

1:11:24.594 --> 1:11:26.496
when I say
that it's excellent news

1:11:26.529 --> 1:11:30.232
that Agnes has managed
to persuade her bank.

1:11:30.265 --> 1:11:34.771
We all know how much Agnes
loves this marvelous house,

1:11:34.804 --> 1:11:38.508
and how difficult it would be
for her to be parted from it.

1:11:38.541 --> 1:11:41.611
It's also very pleasing
that Clara and Thomas

1:11:41.644 --> 1:11:44.914
can now take possession
of their legacy.

1:11:44.947 --> 1:11:47.950
The final payment
to the respective accounts

1:11:47.984 --> 1:11:51.721
will be transferred
by the end of next month.

1:11:51.754 --> 1:11:52.889
Thank you, Martin.

1:11:56.459 --> 1:12:00.797
Right. Well, I think that
wraps things up for today.

1:12:06.402 --> 1:12:07.637
Wanna play, Dad?

1:12:10.573 --> 1:12:11.941
Another time.

1:12:17.714 --> 1:12:19.949
When he comes, I leave.

1:12:22.652 --> 1:12:25.822
Take it easy, sis.

1:12:26.956 --> 1:12:28.491
All right.

1:12:28.524 --> 1:12:31.359
So I walk in,
and you're on your way out.

1:12:31.394 --> 1:12:33.896
Got a home
to take care of.

1:12:33.930 --> 1:12:36.331
I'll see you on the weekend
of 25th-26th.

1:12:36.364 --> 1:12:37.433
Absolutely.

1:12:49.512 --> 1:12:52.014
Maybe you should have married
your brother instead.

1:12:59.489 --> 1:13:01.591
Wolfgang!

1:13:01.624 --> 1:13:04.527
It's been a while.

1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:06.028
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

1:13:11.467 --> 1:13:14.904
- <i>Have you got a pen and paper?</i>
- Yes.

1:13:14.937 --> 1:13:18.340
<i>Silverling House Hotel
in Linden.</i>

1:13:18.373 --> 1:13:20.042
Hm, I'll find it.

1:13:20.076 --> 1:13:21.911
<i>Near the conference center.</i>

1:13:21.944 --> 1:13:25.313
<i>It's walking distance,
so probably no taxi.</i>

1:13:25.347 --> 1:13:28.484
Uh-huh. Okay.

1:13:28.518 --> 1:13:30.453
<i>There'll be
opportunities.</i>

1:13:30.486 --> 1:13:32.889
They usually keep going
till fairly late in the day,

1:13:32.922 --> 1:13:34.891
so it'll be dark.

1:13:36.592 --> 1:13:38.394
And where will you be?

1:13:38.427 --> 1:13:40.863
<i>I'll be at a workshop
in Saarendorf.</i>

1:13:42.098 --> 1:13:44.667
I've borrowed a flat
on Parkstraat,

1:13:44.700 --> 1:13:47.369
a little back street
behind the railway station.

1:13:47.403 --> 1:13:48.938
They're called Wittgenstein.

1:13:48.971 --> 1:13:50.640
<i>Like the philosopher.</i>

1:13:50.673 --> 1:13:52.775
<i>Exactly.</i>

1:13:52.809 --> 1:13:57.345
<i>I'm immersing myself
in the noble art of acting.</i>

1:13:57.380 --> 1:14:00.683
- <i>What are your dogs called?</i>
- What?

1:14:00.716 --> 1:14:02.350
<i>What are your dogs called?</i>

1:14:04.387 --> 1:14:07.890
<i>Well, I call them
Ms. Keats and Mrs. Byron.</i>

1:14:10.126 --> 1:14:13.396
When everything is over,
send me a text,

1:14:13.429 --> 1:14:15.398
<i>"Keats and Byron".</i>

1:14:15.431 --> 1:14:18.668
I'll send you a text,
"Keats and Byron".

1:14:20.870 --> 1:14:23.039
Bye.

1:14:23.072 --> 1:14:24.407
<i>Bye.</i>

1:15:13.456 --> 1:15:15.992
Keats? Byron?

1:15:22.164 --> 1:15:24.433
- Here.
- Thank you.

1:15:24.467 --> 1:15:26.135
Thank you.
I'll be back tomorrow.

1:15:26.168 --> 1:15:27.837
No problem, at all.

1:15:32.975 --> 1:15:37.480
- Hello, Agnes.
- Hello.

1:15:37.513 --> 1:15:39.115
I just want you to...

1:15:39.148 --> 1:15:41.918
Well, I wanted to
apologize about Thomas.

1:15:41.951 --> 1:15:45.054
I know he can be
a bit of an asshole.

1:15:45.087 --> 1:15:47.456
But I'm not Thomas,

1:15:47.490 --> 1:15:49.825
and I wish we'd be
friends, you and I.

1:15:49.859 --> 1:15:52.528
- Do you?
- I know how much you meant to Dad,

1:15:52.561 --> 1:15:56.098
how much he loved you.
I know that.

1:15:56.132 --> 1:15:58.935
And in a way, I'm glad you're
staying at grandfather's house.

1:15:58.968 --> 1:16:02.571
It's sort of continuity.
It's sort of still there.

1:16:02.605 --> 1:16:05.675
And one can come here,
part of one's growing up.

1:16:05.708 --> 1:16:08.010
And I know that's what dad
would have wanted,

1:16:08.044 --> 1:16:11.113
for you stay on here
and we be friends.

1:16:11.147 --> 1:16:14.984
But it hasn't been easy
for me either.

1:16:15.017 --> 1:16:19.255
Yes. I can
understand that, Clara.

1:16:19.288 --> 1:16:20.856
And it's fine.

1:16:24.026 --> 1:16:27.863
- Are you going somewhere?
- No. Not really.

1:16:29.165 --> 1:16:31.033
I appreciate you coming.

1:16:33.235 --> 1:16:35.538
I want you to know that.

1:16:35.571 --> 1:16:37.673
And I'm sure Erich
would have, too.

1:16:38.841 --> 1:16:40.676
Sorry.
I'm a bit in a hurry.

1:16:40.710 --> 1:16:43.512
No, of course.
See you, then.

1:16:43.546 --> 1:16:45.614
Thanks.

1:16:57.660 --> 1:16:59.095
Shit.

1:17:03.165 --> 1:17:04.533
<i>Come on, girls.</i>

1:17:05.835 --> 1:17:07.903
So I'll see you
after the weekend then.

1:17:07.937 --> 1:17:09.305
- Well, what's that?
- It's a slide.

1:17:09.338 --> 1:17:10.873
How are things with you?

1:17:10.906 --> 1:17:12.174
- That's so cool!
- Pass.

1:17:12.208 --> 1:17:13.776
Fine.

1:17:13.809 --> 1:17:16.112
I'm just a bit nervous
about all of this, you know.

1:17:16.145 --> 1:17:18.914
Out of practice,
to say the least.

1:17:18.948 --> 1:17:20.116
It'll be fine.

1:17:20.149 --> 1:17:21.884
I dropped it.
Pick it up.

1:17:21.917 --> 1:17:23.719
Hey, budge over.

1:17:23.753 --> 1:17:25.154
Come on, gang.
Let's get out of here.

1:17:25.187 --> 1:17:27.256
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:17:27.289 --> 1:17:28.858
Bye, Mom.

1:19:24.907 --> 1:19:27.343
Hello? Yeah, it's me.

1:19:31.947 --> 1:19:34.384
Yeah, I'll be there...

1:21:41.877 --> 1:21:44.313
Well, there you are.

1:21:51.588 --> 1:21:54.089
So what about the house?

1:21:54.123 --> 1:21:55.791
Do you think
you'll be able to keep it?

1:21:57.293 --> 1:22:00.463
Endless conversations
with the bank.

1:22:03.032 --> 1:22:05.901
You know, I'd like to help,
but it's just impossible.

1:22:05.934 --> 1:22:08.471
- I can't.
- I know.

1:22:08.505 --> 1:22:10.540
But it will work out fine.

1:22:27.156 --> 1:22:31.060
You know, Henny's at some sort
of workshop in Kaalbringen.

1:22:33.563 --> 1:22:35.297
Or is it Saarendorf?

1:22:35.331 --> 1:22:37.534
I can't remember.

1:22:37.567 --> 1:22:40.302
Anyway, she'll be gone
all weekend.

1:22:41.471 --> 1:22:44.106
Maybe we can meet
somewhere tomorrow?

1:22:48.944 --> 1:22:51.046
I have to get back
to the dogs.

1:22:54.584 --> 1:22:57.086
We can maybe be
in touch tomorrow.

1:22:57.119 --> 1:22:58.854
Absolutely.

1:24:20.703 --> 1:24:23.172
Inside.

1:24:23.205 --> 1:24:26.008
If you touch the gun,
I'll shoot.

1:24:28.277 --> 1:24:30.345
I said inside.

1:24:46.563 --> 1:24:49.198
Drop the bag.

1:25:03.111 --> 1:25:04.647
We're leaving here soon.

1:25:04.681 --> 1:25:07.316
You can take
a seat for now.

1:25:26.769 --> 1:25:28.638
How long have you been
planning this?

1:25:29.739 --> 1:25:32.074
Ever since I realized
it was you.

1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:47.122
Peter doesn't love anyone.

1:25:48.223 --> 1:25:49.792
He can't love anyone.

1:25:49.826 --> 1:25:52.094
Not even his own children.

1:25:53.563 --> 1:25:55.398
That doesn't mean
I think it's okay

1:25:55.431 --> 1:25:58.166
that you're fucking him,

1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:02.405
like some sort of revenge for
something that happened years ago.

1:26:06.843 --> 1:26:09.512
But why this playing games?

1:26:12.415 --> 1:26:15.217
I think I have a bit
too much time on my hands.

1:26:15.250 --> 1:26:17.453
- Huh?
- And also I was curious

1:26:17.487 --> 1:26:19.187
how far you were
prepared to go.

1:26:20.723 --> 1:26:23.158
But what if I had done it?

1:26:24.661 --> 1:26:27.129
What if I had shot him?

1:26:28.230 --> 1:26:30.098
I took a chance.

1:26:31.434 --> 1:26:35.438
And I was right,
wasn't I?

1:26:38.808 --> 1:26:43.345
Because of what happened
in the stupid theater.

1:26:47.784 --> 1:26:50.285
You just can't
move on, can you?

1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:53.188
Okay, you hated me then.

1:26:54.189 --> 1:26:56.426
I can understand that.

1:26:56.459 --> 1:26:58.795
But that was over
ten fucking years ago,

1:26:58.828 --> 1:27:00.663
and you still want
to kill me.

1:27:00.697 --> 1:27:03.700
And you, me, apparently.

1:27:05.568 --> 1:27:08.370
It took a bit of money,
but it was worth it.

1:27:11.306 --> 1:27:12.775
You're sick.

1:27:35.297 --> 1:27:37.734
When things calm down out there,
we'll go for a drive.

1:27:46.341 --> 1:27:49.379
So when the funeral and all of
that crap was out of the way...

1:27:51.414 --> 1:27:54.684
Peter would just move into
your perfect little home?

1:27:56.318 --> 1:27:57.654
With a room each
for the girls, of course.

1:27:57.687 --> 1:27:59.522
You know,
why not convert the loft?

1:28:01.256 --> 1:28:03.526
Did you really think
he'd want that?

1:28:03.559 --> 1:28:06.328
That you mean
so much to him?

1:28:06.361 --> 1:28:08.230
The truth is...

1:28:10.500 --> 1:28:12.735
that he doesn't
mean anything to me.

1:28:15.672 --> 1:28:19.776
It's not my fault
that he doesn't love you.

1:28:21.944 --> 1:28:24.747
You're smart,
you're beautiful,

1:28:24.781 --> 1:28:27.684
and I even think you're funny.

1:28:29.686 --> 1:28:32.789
So I never understood
why Peter doesn't love you.

1:28:32.822 --> 1:28:36.526
And he doesn't
offer me any clues.

1:28:36.559 --> 1:28:38.761
I mean, I've asked him,
all right.

1:28:38.795 --> 1:28:40.930
But you know how he is.

1:28:42.632 --> 1:28:45.300
He zones out.

1:28:45.333 --> 1:28:46.903
I actually feel
sorry for him.

1:28:46.936 --> 1:28:49.906
We have
two children together.

1:28:49.939 --> 1:28:52.508
What fucking right
do you have to destroy that?

1:28:52.542 --> 1:28:55.578
He's the one who came crawling
to me for consolation,

1:28:55.611 --> 1:28:57.747
and you're the one
who wants me to kill him.

1:28:59.582 --> 1:29:01.851
You should be grateful, Henny.

1:29:01.884 --> 1:29:05.521
If I hadn't been there,
he would have left you long ago.

1:29:55.872 --> 1:29:57.006
Hello?

1:29:58.841 --> 1:30:00.777
Yeah.

1:30:00.810 --> 1:30:02.310
What, now?

1:30:02.344 --> 1:30:03.913
What... what time is it?

1:30:05.848 --> 1:30:07.817
Why? What's happened?

1:30:09.018 --> 1:30:12.622
No, no, no. That's okay.
It's okay.

1:30:12.655 --> 1:30:14.690
Boat? What boat?

1:30:16.058 --> 1:30:19.462
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember, yeah.

1:30:19.495 --> 1:30:20.863
Half an hour?
Yeah, yeah, I can be there.

1:30:20.897 --> 1:30:23.900
But... but what's going on?

1:30:23.933 --> 1:30:25.701
What the hell's happened?

1:33:24.046 --> 1:33:25.114
Benji?

1:33:25.147 --> 1:33:27.049
It's been a while.

1:33:28.084 --> 1:33:30.786
Can I come in?

1:33:30.820 --> 1:33:32.021
Please.

1:33:32.054 --> 1:33:35.691
It's been difficult
on the girls,

1:33:35.725 --> 1:33:37.660
but possibly hardest
for Henny.

1:33:39.695 --> 1:33:42.031
Yes, I can understand.

1:33:42.064 --> 1:33:43.733
But you know
what she's like...

1:33:44.734 --> 1:33:47.236
sort of proud, strong.

1:33:50.072 --> 1:33:53.542
The police even suspected
her at one point.

1:33:53.576 --> 1:33:55.811
That she was involved
somehow,

1:33:55.845 --> 1:33:57.713
or even done it
herself.

1:33:59.782 --> 1:34:04.553
And then on top of that,
all the hearsay and gossip.

1:34:04.587 --> 1:34:07.189
So many of her friends
who turned their back on her,

1:34:07.223 --> 1:34:09.125
if you want
to call them friends.

1:34:12.128 --> 1:34:14.597
She must have felt
very alone in all this.

1:34:16.065 --> 1:34:17.933
I can imagine, yes.

1:34:25.174 --> 1:34:27.143
I'd like to ask
a favor of you.

1:34:28.310 --> 1:34:31.714
I know it was
a long time ago,

1:34:31.747 --> 1:34:33.082
but for Henny's sake...

1:35:01.710 --> 1:35:02.812
It's over.

1:35:12.254 --> 1:35:15.758
- Glass of wine?
- Champagne?

1:35:15.791 --> 1:35:19.228
Or maybe...

1:35:21.130 --> 1:35:23.332
Two tequilas
for the two ladies outside.
