00:20.103 --> 00:22.367
Once upon a time...

00:22.439 --> 00:27.069
or maybe twice,
there was an unearthly paradise...

00:27.143 --> 00:30.169
called Pepperland.

00:40.190 --> 00:43.091
Eighty thousand leagues...

00:43.159 --> 00:45.787
beneath the sea it lay.

00:46.863 --> 00:50.492
Or "lie." I'm not too sure.

02:07.177 --> 02:09.839
Pepperland is a tickle of joy...

02:09.913 --> 02:13.041
on the blue belly of the universe.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.252
It must be scratched.

02:18.321 --> 02:20.346
Right, Max?

02:20.423 --> 02:22.948
- Yes, Your Blueness.
- What?

02:24.060 --> 02:28.292
We Meanies only take no
for an answer!

02:28.364 --> 02:31.800
Is that understood, Max?

02:31.868 --> 02:33.460
No, Your Blueness.

02:33.536 --> 02:36.198
That's better.

02:36.272 --> 02:40.436
- Are the troops in readiness?
- No, Your Blueness.

02:40.510 --> 02:42.637
The bonkers?

02:42.712 --> 02:44.339
Clowns?

02:44.414 --> 02:46.314
Snapping Turks?

02:46.382 --> 02:48.976
Anti-music missiles?

02:49.052 --> 02:51.486
The dreadful flying glove?

02:51.554 --> 02:53.488
Splendid!

02:54.557 --> 02:55.649
Today...

02:55.725 --> 03:00.560
Pepperland goes "blooey."

03:02.699 --> 03:04.496
Fire.

03:47.677 --> 03:49.508
The Meanies are comin'!

03:49.579 --> 03:51.877
Glove?

03:51.948 --> 03:54.508
Come here, Glove.

03:54.584 --> 03:57.109
Look out there,
and what do you see?

03:57.186 --> 04:00.986
- Tell him, Max.
- Someone running, Glove.

04:01.057 --> 04:02.490
Yes.

04:02.558 --> 04:06.585
Well, you'll soon put a stop
to that, won't you, Glovie?

04:06.663 --> 04:10.531
Go, Glove.
Point, and having pointed, pounce!

04:10.600 --> 04:12.898
Go!

04:26.983 --> 04:28.314
Oh, dear!

04:30.987 --> 04:34.423
Oh, I haven't laughed so much
since Pompeii.

04:52.075 --> 04:56.136
What! The glove is losing
his touch!

04:56.212 --> 04:57.804
Clown!

04:59.148 --> 05:01.082
Do your worst.

05:02.352 --> 05:05.219
Explode them.

05:20.837 --> 05:22.930
Not polite to point.

05:33.282 --> 05:35.477
A thing of beauty.

05:35.551 --> 05:38.042
Destroy it forever!

05:53.403 --> 05:56.395
Sir, the Blue Meanies are coming!

05:56.472 --> 05:59.999
Not here, young Fred.

06:00.076 --> 06:02.601
They wouldn't dare.

06:02.678 --> 06:06.580
They would! They are.
What are you going to do?

06:06.649 --> 06:09.982
Finish the quartet.

06:10.053 --> 06:11.315
Fire!

06:18.061 --> 06:20.086
A trio, sir.

06:24.567 --> 06:26.000
Duet, sir.

06:27.070 --> 06:28.367
Duet?

06:30.440 --> 06:32.601
Solo.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.604
Young Fred...

06:38.281 --> 06:41.409
the Blue Meanies are coming.

06:58.034 --> 07:02.528
"Four-scores" and 32 bars ago...

07:02.605 --> 07:04.129
our "four-fathers"...

07:04.207 --> 07:06.038
A quartet.

07:06.109 --> 07:10.102
- and "four-mothers"...
- Mother quartet.

07:10.179 --> 07:14.047
made it in this yellow submarine...

07:14.117 --> 07:15.812
What, that little thing?

07:15.885 --> 07:18.012
to Pepperland.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.556
Climb aboard, young Fred.

07:23.626 --> 07:26.561
But sir, I can't even
make meself float.

07:26.629 --> 07:30.224
I'm appointing you lord admiral.

07:30.299 --> 07:33.132
Lord admiral!
Well, in that event, yes.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.765
Hurry, young Fred.

07:38.841 --> 07:42.675
- Go, get help.
- Where should I go?

07:44.413 --> 07:47.780
No time for trivialities.

07:56.592 --> 08:00.926
In the town where I was born

08:00.997 --> 08:03.056
Lived a man

08:03.132 --> 08:05.362
Who sailed to sea

08:05.434 --> 08:09.837
And he told us of his life

08:09.906 --> 08:14.206
In the land of submarines

08:14.277 --> 08:16.472
So we sailed

08:16.546 --> 08:18.537
On to the sun

08:18.614 --> 08:22.880
Till we found the sea of green

08:22.952 --> 08:27.286
And we lived beneath the waves

08:27.356 --> 08:31.122
In our yellow submarine

08:32.595 --> 08:36.587
We all live in a yellow submarine

08:36.666 --> 08:38.600
Yellow submarine

08:41.037 --> 08:45.235
We all live in a yellow submarine

08:49.245 --> 08:53.648
And our friends are all aboard

08:53.716 --> 08:57.880
Many more of them live next door

08:57.954 --> 09:02.254
And the band begins to play

09:29.085 --> 09:31.815
Full speed ahead, Mr. Barclay.

09:41.964 --> 09:46.128
As we live a life of ease

09:46.202 --> 09:50.502
Every one of us has all we need

09:50.573 --> 09:54.873
Sky of blue and sea of green

09:54.944 --> 09:59.210
In our yellow submarine

11:19.962 --> 11:24.422
Ah, look at all the lonely people

11:26.869 --> 11:31.499
Ah, look at all the lonely people

11:33.976 --> 11:36.536
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice

11:36.612 --> 11:40.776
In the church
where her wedding has been

11:40.850 --> 11:42.909
Lives in a dream

11:42.985 --> 11:45.453
Waits at the window
wearing the face

11:45.521 --> 11:49.287
That she keeps in a jar by the door

11:49.358 --> 11:51.553
Who is it for

11:51.627 --> 11:54.460
All the lonely people

11:54.530 --> 11:58.364
Where do they all come from

11:58.434 --> 12:01.665
All the lonely people

12:01.737 --> 12:04.672
Where do they all belong

12:05.841 --> 12:07.468
Father McKenzie

12:07.543 --> 12:12.503
Writing the words of a sermon
that no one will hear

12:12.581 --> 12:14.606
No one comes near

12:14.683 --> 12:17.277
Look at him working
Darning his socks

12:17.353 --> 12:21.312
In the night when there's nobody there

12:21.390 --> 12:23.381
What does he care

12:51.487 --> 12:54.149
Eleanor Rigby died in the church

12:54.223 --> 12:58.125
And was buried along with her name

12:58.194 --> 13:00.094
Nobody came

13:00.162 --> 13:03.654
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands

13:03.732 --> 13:06.326
As he walks from the grave

13:06.402 --> 13:09.428
No one was saved

13:32.161 --> 13:35.597
Woe is me.

13:39.268 --> 13:42.260
Liverpool can be a lonely place
on a Saturday night.

13:42.338 --> 13:44.272
And this is only Thursday morning.

13:44.340 --> 13:47.639
Compared with my life,
Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl.

13:47.710 --> 13:49.302
Nothing ever happens to me.

13:49.378 --> 13:53.109
I feel like
an old splintered drumstick.

13:53.182 --> 13:57.482
I'd jump into the River Mersey,
but it looks like rain.

13:58.954 --> 14:00.683
Nothing ever happens to me.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.324
Puss, puss, puss.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.961
Hey, pussy.
Here, pussy.

15:04.954 --> 15:08.890
Would you believe me if I told you I was
being followed by a yellow submarine?

15:11.393 --> 15:14.794
- No, I would not.
- Oh, yeah. I didn't think you would.

15:20.569 --> 15:23.197
I could have sworn
there was a yellow submarine.

15:23.272 --> 15:25.297
But that isn't logical, now,
is it?

15:25.374 --> 15:28.343
It must have been one of them
unidentified flying cupcakes.

15:28.410 --> 15:30.878
Or a figment of me imagination.

15:32.147 --> 15:34.707
But I don't have
an imagination.

15:44.293 --> 15:47.160
Help!

15:48.464 --> 15:51.228
- Thanks, I don't need any.
- Help!

15:51.300 --> 15:54.565
Won't you please, please help me?

15:54.637 --> 15:56.571
Be specific.

15:58.073 --> 15:59.938
Music!

16:00.009 --> 16:03.843
Blue! Blue!
The submarine...

16:03.912 --> 16:07.279
Explosions!
Blue Meanies!

16:07.349 --> 16:08.748
What you need is...

16:08.817 --> 16:12.514
"H" for hurry, "E" for "ergent,"
"L" for love me...

16:12.588 --> 16:16.490
and "P" for please help!

17:08.911 --> 17:11.971
Oh, your story has touched me heart.

17:12.047 --> 17:13.981
Jump in. We'll get me friends.

17:14.049 --> 17:16.915
- Oh, bless you.
- Did I sneeze?

17:19.887 --> 17:22.617
- Just park it here.
- I'll just park it here.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.391
Hey, what would your friends
be doing here?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.594
- Just playing.
- Just playing what?

17:33.669 --> 17:35.899
Just playing around.

17:44.012 --> 17:45.946
Can't we take one of these?

17:46.014 --> 17:48.141
No, Fred.
I only work with me mates.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.619
- Frankenstein?
- I used to go out with his sister.

17:54.690 --> 17:56.487
- His sister?
- Yeah. Phyllis.

17:56.558 --> 18:00.551
- What would happen if I pull this lever?
- You mustn't do that.

18:00.629 --> 18:03.029
Can't help it.
I'm a born "Liver-pooler."

18:36.398 --> 18:39.799
Hey, Ringo.
I've just had the strangest dream.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.893
I warned you not to eat
on an empty stomach.

18:41.970 --> 18:44.131
Listen to old Fred.

18:47.743 --> 18:49.677
Submarine, explosions...

18:49.745 --> 18:51.940
Blue Meanies!

18:53.282 --> 18:55.216
What do you think?

18:57.419 --> 18:59.353
I think it needs rehearsal.

19:00.989 --> 19:04.356
- When do we leave?
- Well, let's get the other two, John.

19:05.794 --> 19:07.819
- What day is it?
- "Sitar-day."

19:07.896 --> 19:08.863
Then George'll be here.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.127
George, what are you doing up there?

19:47.202 --> 19:49.136
Now, what is it, Ringo?

19:50.906 --> 19:53.170
Is there a matter
you'd like to take up?

19:54.610 --> 19:56.043
Or down?

19:56.111 --> 19:57.840
This chap here.

20:01.183 --> 20:02.548
Submarine, explosions...

20:02.618 --> 20:06.179
Blue Meanies.

20:06.255 --> 20:08.849
Aw, you're nuts, the pair of you.

20:08.924 --> 20:11.791
Hey, wait. That's my car, lad.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.919
How would you know, lad?

20:13.996 --> 20:16.157
I'd know it anywhere.

20:16.231 --> 20:19.064
- What's it look like then?
- It's red with yellow wheels.

20:20.903 --> 20:24.100
I mean blue with orange wheels.

20:25.173 --> 20:26.868
It's all in the mind.

20:26.942 --> 20:30.002
- Come on, move over. I'm driving.
- No. I got here first.

20:30.078 --> 20:32.137
- I'll drive if you like.
- No, you sit in the middle.

20:32.214 --> 20:34.148
- I'm in the middle.
- You said you were driving.

20:34.216 --> 20:36.776
- I am driving.
- I'll get in the back then.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.596
Do you think
we're interrupting something?

21:26.668 --> 21:28.260
I think so.

21:28.337 --> 21:30.999
We've gotta find Paul, haven't we?

21:36.778 --> 21:40.544
- It's all in the mind.
- We'll try one of those doors.

21:50.092 --> 21:52.117
Yes, "dey do" look very nice,
"don't dey?"

21:52.194 --> 21:54.389
- Yes, "dey do."
- "Dey do dough, don't dey?"

21:54.463 --> 21:56.829
- Yes, "dey do."
- "Don't dey, dough?"

21:56.898 --> 21:58.923
"Dough?"

21:59.001 --> 22:01.026
Fa-la. "Dat dough!"

22:01.103 --> 22:04.197
What's the matter fellas?
Blue Meanies?

22:04.272 --> 22:08.106
- Well, lads, what do you think?
- I think that...

22:08.176 --> 22:11.668
Remember there'll be rough seas ahead.
What do you think?

22:11.747 --> 22:13.339
Well, then, um...

22:13.415 --> 22:16.942
Pounding, overwhelming waves.
What do you think of that, eh?

22:17.019 --> 22:20.614
- Well, I think that...
- As a matter of fact, I think...

22:20.789 --> 22:22.757
- Well?
- I've forgotten.

22:22.824 --> 22:25.156
Right, then. Let's get
this vessel shipshape.

22:25.227 --> 22:28.424
I kind of like the way it is.
"Submarine-shape."

23:13.075 --> 23:15.976
So this is a submarine.

23:16.044 --> 23:19.172
- Soft, isn't it?
- Not if you're on the bottom.

23:19.247 --> 23:22.375
All right lads.
Time to stow the gab and turn to.

23:22.451 --> 23:25.045
Groovy. How do you start this thing?

23:26.221 --> 23:28.917
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.720
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies
in the neighborhood?

23:34.162 --> 23:36.289
Then you start looking
for a switch.

23:41.303 --> 23:43.237
Perhaps this is it.

23:47.342 --> 23:49.742
One, two, three, four

23:49.811 --> 23:52.336
Can I have a little more

23:52.414 --> 23:55.315
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

23:55.383 --> 23:57.408
I love you

23:57.486 --> 23:59.784
A, B, C, D

23:59.855 --> 24:02.119
Can I bring my friend to tea

24:02.190 --> 24:05.318
E, F, G, H, I, J

24:05.393 --> 24:07.588
I love you

24:08.630 --> 24:10.097
Sail the ship

24:11.366 --> 24:13.630
Chop the tree

24:13.702 --> 24:16.227
Skip the rope

24:16.304 --> 24:19.000
Look at me

24:19.074 --> 24:21.542
All together now

24:29.584 --> 24:32.382
Black, white, green, red

24:32.454 --> 24:34.922
Can I take my friend to bed

24:34.990 --> 24:37.925
Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue

24:37.993 --> 24:39.893
I love you
All together now

25:52.148 --> 25:54.082
What time is it, governor?

25:56.152 --> 25:58.985
It's time for time.

25:59.055 --> 26:01.319
Look, the hands are slowing down.

26:11.234 --> 26:13.168
Do you ever get the feeling...

26:13.236 --> 26:17.036
that things aren't as rosy
as they appear to be under the surface?

26:17.106 --> 26:19.040
What's happening, John?

26:19.108 --> 26:21.042
In my humble opinion,
we've become involved...

26:21.110 --> 26:23.670
in Einstein's time-space
continuum theory.

26:23.746 --> 26:24.804
Aye.

26:24.881 --> 26:27.179
- "Relatively" speaking, that is.
- Of course.

26:28.251 --> 26:30.617
- Maybe time's going on strike.
- What for?

26:30.687 --> 26:32.587
- Shorter hours.
- I don't blame it.

26:32.655 --> 26:34.623
It must be very tiring
being time.

26:34.691 --> 26:37.660
- Why?
- It's a 24-hour day, isn't it?

26:37.727 --> 26:39.558
- You surprise me, Ringo.
- Why?

26:39.629 --> 26:41.961
- Dealing in abstracts.
- Now, look, John.

26:42.031 --> 26:46.195
Just because I'm a drummer
doesn't mean that... I feel funny.

26:46.269 --> 26:48.601
Ringo, you're not half the lad
you used to be.

26:48.671 --> 26:50.400
Everything's getting bigger.

26:50.473 --> 26:53.636
It's not.
It's us that are getting smaller.

26:53.710 --> 26:56.076
- I want me mum!
- And younger.

26:56.145 --> 26:59.114
Here you are, lads.
Old Fred'll get you out of all this.

27:01.017 --> 27:02.951
Look at that! Cor!

27:03.019 --> 27:06.887
- It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
- It's not. It's Father Time.

27:06.956 --> 27:08.617
- How do you know?
- I read it.

27:08.691 --> 27:12.320
I don't want to alarm you,
but the years are going backwards.

27:12.395 --> 27:14.625
- What's that mean, old Fred?
- It means...

27:14.697 --> 27:16.790
that if we slip back at this rate...

27:16.866 --> 27:18.959
very soon we'll all disappear
up our own existence.

27:19.035 --> 27:20.229
What shall we do?

27:20.303 --> 27:23.795
I suppose we could always try
a few buttons.

27:25.174 --> 27:26.835
I want me mum.

27:26.909 --> 27:29.537
Time's fast running out for us
I'm afraid.

27:29.612 --> 27:32.012
- Can't we do something to the clock?
- What do you mean?

27:32.081 --> 27:35.482
- Move the hands forward.
- Clever lad.

27:35.551 --> 27:37.746
Something strange is happening.

27:44.727 --> 27:46.319
It's speeding up now.

27:58.708 --> 28:01.677
Funny. A submarine
remarkably like our own.

28:01.744 --> 28:04.338
Uncannily.

28:04.414 --> 28:06.678
There's someone in it. Look.

28:06.749 --> 28:09.684
- And they're waving.
- It's a group of fellas.

28:09.752 --> 28:12.346
Wave back.

28:12.422 --> 28:15.357
Maybe we're both part
of a vast yellow submarine fleet.

28:15.425 --> 28:18.417
- There's only two of us.
- Then I would suggest...

28:18.494 --> 28:20.962
that yonder yellow submarine
is none other than ourselves...

28:21.030 --> 28:22.964
- Going backwards.
- in time.

28:23.032 --> 28:24.397
Look at Ringo.

28:26.903 --> 28:29.599
Oh, dear.
Oh, we're all the same!

28:29.672 --> 28:32.436
Senile delinquents.

28:32.508 --> 28:36.069
And I can hear my beard growing.

28:36.145 --> 28:38.807
We'd better do something.

28:40.717 --> 28:44.244
When I get older
Losing my hair

28:44.320 --> 28:47.756
Many years from now

28:47.824 --> 28:51.260
Will you still be sending me
a valentine

28:51.327 --> 28:54.763
Birthday greetings
Bottle of wine

28:54.831 --> 28:58.096
If I'd been out
till quarter to three

28:58.167 --> 29:01.534
Would you lock the door

29:01.604 --> 29:05.165
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me

29:05.241 --> 29:07.709
When I'm 64

29:15.852 --> 29:20.221
You'll be older too

29:24.494 --> 29:28.624
And if you say the word

29:29.699 --> 29:33.635
I could stay with you

29:38.374 --> 29:41.605
I could be handy mending a fuse

29:41.677 --> 29:44.009
When your lights have gone

29:45.281 --> 29:48.648
You can knit a sweater
by the fireside

29:48.718 --> 29:51.778
Sunday mornings go for a ride

29:51.854 --> 29:55.483
Doing the garden
Digging the weeds

29:55.558 --> 29:57.651
Who could ask for more

30:05.935 --> 30:09.735
Every summer we can rent
a cottage in the Isle of Wight

30:09.806 --> 30:11.933
If it's not too dear

30:13.109 --> 30:17.842
We shall scrimp and save

30:21.684 --> 30:25.245
Grandchildren on your knee

30:26.889 --> 30:31.019
Vera, Chuck and Dave

30:35.531 --> 30:39.023
Send me a postcard
Drop me a line

30:39.101 --> 30:42.366
Stating point of view

30:42.438 --> 30:45.601
Indicate precisely
what you mean to say

30:45.675 --> 30:49.441
Yours sincerely wasting away

30:49.512 --> 30:52.504
Give me your answer
Fill in a form

30:52.582 --> 30:56.416
Mine forevermore

31:05.127 --> 31:08.460
Correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen,
but would you agree...

31:08.531 --> 31:10.726
that we have been passing
through the Sea of Time?

31:10.800 --> 31:13.997
That would explain a few things.
Yes.

31:14.070 --> 31:16.004
I'm glad I'm not young anymore.

31:16.072 --> 31:18.870
Or was I so old?

31:18.941 --> 31:20.932
What kind of a sea is this?

31:21.010 --> 31:23.501
The Sea of Science.

31:23.579 --> 31:25.012
Oh, yeah.

31:39.562 --> 31:44.659
If you're listening to this song

31:44.734 --> 31:50.400
You may think the chords
are going wrong

31:53.809 --> 31:56.243
But they're not

31:56.312 --> 31:58.803
He just wrote it like that

32:03.819 --> 32:08.620
When you're listening late at night

32:08.691 --> 32:13.754
You may think the band
are not quite right

32:17.166 --> 32:19.634
But they are

32:19.702 --> 32:22.136
They just play it like that

32:26.142 --> 32:31.079
It doesn't really matter
what chords I play

32:31.147 --> 32:33.081
What words I say

32:33.149 --> 32:37.677
Or time of day it is

32:37.753 --> 32:41.052
'Cause it's only a normal song

33:07.216 --> 33:11.880
It doesn't really matter
what clothes I wear

33:11.954 --> 33:14.115
Or how I fare

33:14.190 --> 33:18.684
Or if my hair is brown

33:18.761 --> 33:23.425
When it's only a normal song

33:26.002 --> 33:30.939
If you think the harmony

33:31.007 --> 33:35.740
Is a little dark
and out of key

33:39.148 --> 33:41.082
You're correct

33:42.151 --> 33:44.585
There's nobody there

33:59.235 --> 34:03.194
And I told you there's no one there

34:13.149 --> 34:16.641
- Hey, he looks wrong.
- He doesn't look at all well.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.311
In fact, he's horrible.

34:18.387 --> 34:20.411
He's so ugly.

34:20.489 --> 34:23.219
- Really ugly.
- Somebody push a button.

34:41.342 --> 34:44.176
- There's a cyclops.
- Can't be. He's got two eyes.

34:44.246 --> 34:46.179
Must be a "bi-cyclops."

34:46.248 --> 34:49.045
- There's another one.
- A whole "cyclop-edia."

35:46.041 --> 35:47.975
There's a school of whales.

35:48.811 --> 35:53.214
- They look a bit old for school.
- University, then.

35:53.282 --> 35:56.479
- University of "Wales."
- They look like dropouts to me.

35:56.552 --> 35:58.383
You've got to steer clear.

35:58.454 --> 36:01.082
- Steer clear?
- Yes. Steer! Clear?

36:01.157 --> 36:02.590
Yes, dear.

36:09.899 --> 36:12.299
Now, whatever you do,
don't touch that button.

36:12.368 --> 36:14.359
- Which button?
- That one.

36:14.436 --> 36:16.028
This one?

36:19.141 --> 36:21.541
That was the panic button.

36:26.949 --> 36:29.543
- Poor Ringo.
- Poor lad.

36:29.618 --> 36:31.381
Never did no harm to no one.

36:31.453 --> 36:34.388
Hey, lads, now Ringo's gone.
What are we gonna do?

36:34.456 --> 36:37.948
- Learn to sing trios.
- No, let's save the poor devil.

36:39.895 --> 36:41.453
I see footsteps.

36:41.530 --> 36:44.624
- It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
- Preparing to attack.

37:08.490 --> 37:11.288
- I don't half miss Ringo.
- He's "far out" there.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.952
Always was.

37:26.408 --> 37:30.344
- Here comes Ringo.
- "H" is for hurry!

37:30.412 --> 37:32.346
There goes Ringo.

37:32.414 --> 37:34.348
Hey, it's seen us.

37:35.150 --> 37:38.244
- Find the boxing button!
- Whoever heard of a boxing button?

37:38.320 --> 37:41.084
Who cares? Find one.

37:45.427 --> 37:46.689
Fire one.

37:50.532 --> 37:53.296
Uh-oh, wrong one.

37:53.369 --> 37:54.893
That.

38:22.331 --> 38:24.458
- There goes Ringo again.
- Rides well, doesn't he?

38:24.533 --> 38:27.400
"E" is for "ergent!"

38:37.079 --> 38:40.242
Oh, no.
Not the dreaded vacuum flask again.

38:40.316 --> 38:42.841
- We'll be sucked into oblivion.
- Or even further.

38:42.918 --> 38:44.852
Put her in reverse.

38:48.023 --> 38:49.581
So long, "sucker."

38:49.658 --> 38:51.819
- Too much.
- Too soon.

38:51.894 --> 38:54.158
Reverse!

38:56.699 --> 39:00.567
- Ringo time.
- "L" is for love me!

39:07.242 --> 39:08.834
Injuns!

39:08.911 --> 39:10.503
Help!

39:17.353 --> 39:22.256
"P" is for please!

39:25.361 --> 39:26.658
Press a button.

39:46.048 --> 39:49.609
- How was it, Ringo?
- "'Arrowing."

40:03.832 --> 40:06.665
Hey, look who's back.
Full speed ahead.

40:06.735 --> 40:08.965
- Oh, no.
- The motor's packing in.

40:09.037 --> 40:13.030
By all the sea nymphets!
We're losing power.

40:13.108 --> 40:15.269
- We're being swallowed.
- What shall we do?

40:15.344 --> 40:17.403
- Serve tea.
- Lovely.

40:36.165 --> 40:40.192
By Neptune's knickerbockers!
She's puttered out.

40:40.269 --> 40:43.568
- Maybe we should call a road service.
- Can't. No road.

40:43.639 --> 40:46.130
And we're not "sub-scribers."

40:46.208 --> 40:48.574
Subscribers. Oh.

40:48.644 --> 40:50.578
I know something about motors.

40:50.646 --> 40:53.410
- Let me have a look.
- Here.

40:53.482 --> 40:57.043
- Is that the motor?
- Can't you tell one when you see one?

40:57.119 --> 40:59.144
Course I can.
Let me peruse it.

41:02.491 --> 41:04.652
- What do you think?
- I think I burnt me finger.

41:04.726 --> 41:07.126
Here, lads. Look at this.

41:07.196 --> 41:09.426
- What do you think it is?
- Nothing.

41:09.498 --> 41:12.695
- It looks like nothing.
- It's a local inhabitant.

41:12.768 --> 41:16.329
- He's probably one of the nothings.
- At least that's something.

41:17.306 --> 41:19.240
- Let's show him our motor.
- Steady on.

41:19.308 --> 41:21.503
You don't want to show
your motor to just anybody.

41:21.577 --> 41:23.169
But this is a nobody.

41:23.245 --> 41:25.406
Medic, pedic, zed oblique.

41:25.481 --> 41:28.279
Orphic, morphic, dorfic, Greek.

41:28.350 --> 41:31.217
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.

41:31.286 --> 41:33.982
So little time, so much to know.

41:34.056 --> 41:35.853
Can you tell us where we're at?

41:35.924 --> 41:38.119
A true Socratic query, that.

41:38.193 --> 41:40.354
And who the Billy Shears are you?

41:40.429 --> 41:41.862
Who?

41:41.930 --> 41:44.228
Ah, who indeed am I?

41:45.267 --> 41:47.792
Jeremy?

41:47.870 --> 41:49.895
Hillary?

41:49.972 --> 41:51.439
Boob?

41:51.507 --> 41:53.998
- What?
- Who?

41:54.076 --> 41:56.510
Eminent physicist,
polyglot classicist...

41:56.578 --> 41:58.842
prize-winning botanist,
hard-biting satirist...

41:58.914 --> 42:01.280
talented pianist, good dentist too.

42:01.350 --> 42:04.285
- Lousy poet.
- Critic's voice. Take your choice.

42:04.353 --> 42:07.015
- Must be one of them angry young men.
- Or a daffy old creep.

42:07.089 --> 42:09.387
I? Daffy old creep?

42:10.492 --> 42:14.553
- Do you speak English?
- Old English, Middle, a dialect, pure...

42:14.630 --> 42:17.963
- Well, do you speak English?
- You know, I'm not sure!

42:20.918 --> 42:24.752
- Why don't we show him our motor?
- Should we really show him our motor?

42:24.821 --> 42:28.518
- He may not have seen one before.
- Turboprop supercombustional spring.

42:28.592 --> 42:30.958
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic.

42:31.028 --> 42:34.725
This motor, I see,
has a broken-down thing.

42:36.033 --> 42:37.728
He fixed it.

42:37.801 --> 42:39.735
Great. Let's go.

42:41.138 --> 42:45.632
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.

42:45.709 --> 42:48.269
Must you always talk in rhyme?

42:48.345 --> 42:52.543
If I spoke prose you'd all find out
I don't know what I talk about.

42:52.616 --> 42:57.644
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo,
so little time, so much to know.

42:58.622 --> 42:59.919
Fellas, look.

42:59.990 --> 43:04.552
The footnotes for my 19th book. This is
my standard procedure for doing it...

43:04.628 --> 43:07.153
and while I compose it
I'm also reviewing it.

43:07.230 --> 43:09.164
A boob for all seasons.

43:09.232 --> 43:11.393
- How can he lose?
- Were your notices good?

43:11.468 --> 43:13.561
It's my policy never
to read my reviews.

43:13.737 --> 43:16.001
There must be a word
for what he is.

43:16.073 --> 43:19.804
He's a real nowhere man

43:19.876 --> 43:23.642
Sitting in his nowhere land

43:23.714 --> 43:27.980
Making all his nowhere plans

43:28.051 --> 43:30.178
For nobody

43:32.189 --> 43:36.182
Doesn't have a point of view

43:36.259 --> 43:39.854
Knows not where he's going to

43:39.930 --> 43:44.230
Isn't he a bit like you

43:44.301 --> 43:46.235
And me

43:47.304 --> 43:51.035
Nowhere man, please listen

43:51.108 --> 43:55.477
You don't know what you're missing

43:55.545 --> 43:57.843
Nowhere man

43:57.914 --> 44:01.577
The world is at your command

44:19.569 --> 44:23.596
He's as blind as he can be

44:23.673 --> 44:27.575
Just sees what he wants to see

44:27.644 --> 44:32.707
Nowhere man
can you see me at all

44:34.785 --> 44:38.744
Nowhere man, don't worry

44:38.822 --> 44:40.915
Take your time

44:40.991 --> 44:42.515
Don't hurry

44:42.592 --> 44:45.459
Leave it all

44:45.529 --> 44:49.829
Till somebody else
lends you a hand

44:51.701 --> 44:55.762
Doesn't have a point of view

44:55.839 --> 44:59.605
Knows not where he's going to

44:59.676 --> 45:04.113
Isn't he a bit like you and me

45:06.516 --> 45:10.452
Nowhere man, please listen

45:10.520 --> 45:14.456
You don't know what you're missing

45:14.524 --> 45:16.924
Nowhere man

45:16.993 --> 45:21.487
The world is at your command

45:23.333 --> 45:26.894
He's a real nowhere man

45:26.970 --> 45:31.236
Sitting in his nowhere land

45:31.308 --> 45:34.937
Making all his nowhere plans

45:35.011 --> 45:37.104
For nobody

45:54.297 --> 45:56.390
Men, all aboard.
Let's go somewhere.

45:56.466 --> 45:58.161
What about him?

45:58.235 --> 46:01.966
He's happy enough
going round in circles.

46:02.038 --> 46:03.630
Poor little fella.

46:03.707 --> 46:07.700
I don't know.
Ringo's just a sentimentalist.

46:07.777 --> 46:10.439
Look at him.
Can't he come with us?

46:14.384 --> 46:17.683
Hey, Mr. Boob, you can come
with us if you like.

46:17.754 --> 46:20.552
You mean, you'd take
a nowhere man?

46:20.624 --> 46:22.182
We'll take you somewhere.

46:24.027 --> 46:26.291
Okay, Booby, down the hatch.

46:26.363 --> 46:30.060
Down the hatch.
A quite curious phrase.

46:30.133 --> 46:33.193
The Middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.

46:33.270 --> 46:36.000
Its usage undoubtedly
on the increase.

46:36.072 --> 46:38.870
I must work it into
my new statesman piece.

46:38.942 --> 46:41.877
- That's the hatch, friend.
- Indeed.

46:42.012 --> 46:44.412
Steady now, crew.
Prepare to go forward.

46:44.481 --> 46:46.847
Forward.

47:05.435 --> 47:08.404
- It's awfully quiet.
- What should we do, Jeremy?

47:08.471 --> 47:11.065
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.

47:11.141 --> 47:14.008
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.

47:30.460 --> 47:33.691
Log sine, clog sine,
big thingamabob.

47:33.763 --> 47:35.697
- What's he saying?
- What's he doing?

47:35.765 --> 47:40.099
Chewing gum will do the job.
A turn of the screw and all is...

47:40.170 --> 47:41.865
And all is new.

47:41.938 --> 47:43.530
I can't stop her.

47:43.606 --> 47:48.100
"H" is for hurry. "E" is for "ergent."
"L" is for love me.

47:48.178 --> 47:50.510
"P" is for good-bye.

47:50.580 --> 47:53.981
- That was lovely, Jeremy.
- We've lost the sub for good.

47:54.050 --> 47:56.075
- Or for bad.
- Or for worse.

47:57.220 --> 48:00.348
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.
- But he did fix the motor.

48:02.125 --> 48:03.990
Where are we?

48:04.060 --> 48:05.994
Don't know.
Looks like the foothills.

48:06.062 --> 48:09.657
- The foothills of what?
- The foothills of the "headlands."

48:27.951 --> 48:30.579
Picture yourself

48:30.653 --> 48:33.178
In a boat on a river

48:33.256 --> 48:35.918
With tangerine trees

48:35.992 --> 48:39.086
And marmalade skies

48:40.463 --> 48:42.863
Somebody calls you

48:42.932 --> 48:46.026
You answer quite slowly

48:46.102 --> 48:50.801
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

48:54.677 --> 48:57.043
Cellophane flowers

48:57.113 --> 48:59.809
Of yellow and green

48:59.883 --> 49:04.115
Towering over your head

49:05.288 --> 49:09.190
Look for the girl
with the sun in her eyes

49:09.259 --> 49:11.193
And she's gone

49:13.296 --> 49:16.595
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

49:31.381 --> 49:33.440
Follow her down

49:33.516 --> 49:36.713
To a bridge by a fountain

49:36.786 --> 49:39.152
Where rocking horse people

49:39.222 --> 49:42.487
Eat marshmallow pies

49:43.960 --> 49:48.727
Everyone smiles
as you drift past the flowers

49:48.798 --> 49:53.064
That grow so incredibly high

49:57.340 --> 50:02.403
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore

50:02.479 --> 50:05.846
Waiting to take you away

50:07.383 --> 50:11.080
Climb in the back
with your head in the clouds

50:11.154 --> 50:13.088
And you're gone

50:14.858 --> 50:18.794
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

50:33.376 --> 50:35.310
Picture yourself

50:35.378 --> 50:38.575
On a train in a station

50:38.648 --> 50:40.707
With plasticine porters

50:40.783 --> 50:44.014
With looking-glass ties

50:45.555 --> 50:50.583
Suddenly someone
is there at the turnstile

50:50.660 --> 50:54.619
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

51:26.062 --> 51:27.689
Carry on, lad.

51:27.764 --> 51:29.698
He certainly was carrying on.

51:32.802 --> 51:34.531
I feel a draft.

51:34.604 --> 51:37.937
We must be the near
the Sea of Holes.

51:38.007 --> 51:41.170
Don't you think we should
ask somebody for directions?

51:42.979 --> 51:45.777
- Excuse us.
- Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?

51:49.986 --> 51:51.248
Thanks.

51:54.357 --> 51:56.291
Gosh, look at all this dust.

51:57.827 --> 51:59.294
Where did it come from?

51:59.362 --> 52:02.422
A chemical error and quite imprecise.
This is a condiment...

52:02.498 --> 52:04.090
- Condi...
- A spice.

52:04.167 --> 52:06.431
He's right, you know.
It's a pepper.

52:06.502 --> 52:08.094
Pepper?

53:02.959 --> 53:04.893
Is anybody home?

53:04.961 --> 53:07.259
- Where are we?
- A "holey" sea.

53:07.330 --> 53:09.821
This place reminds me
of Blackburn, Lancashire.

53:09.899 --> 53:11.196
Oh, boy!

53:11.267 --> 53:13.667
How many do you think
there are in all?

53:13.736 --> 53:16.762
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.

53:16.839 --> 53:19.831
Say, didn't old Fred mention something
about the Sea of Holes...

53:19.909 --> 53:21.900
just before the Sea of Green?

53:21.978 --> 53:24.776
Yeah. Through one of them slots
must be the Sea of Green.

53:24.847 --> 53:26.940
But which one?

53:27.884 --> 53:30.478
Thesis, antithesis.

53:30.553 --> 53:32.316
Synthesis.

53:32.388 --> 53:35.118
Causes of causal causation.

53:38.127 --> 53:41.619
What do you know about holes?

53:41.698 --> 53:44.360
There are simply no holes
in my education.

53:46.035 --> 53:49.732
You mean, you haven't composed
a "whole" book?

53:49.806 --> 53:52.400
Oh, great.
What shall we do?

53:52.475 --> 53:54.773
Be empirical. Look.

53:54.844 --> 53:56.835
The boob is making
more and more sense.

53:56.913 --> 53:58.847
Getting better all the time.

53:58.915 --> 54:01.315
Great. Let's all look
for the Sea of Green.

54:01.384 --> 54:04.080
The Sea of Holes...

54:04.153 --> 54:07.145
into the Sea of Green.

54:09.525 --> 54:13.825
Hydrolyte, verdant chrysoidine.

54:13.896 --> 54:16.490
I think we're near
the Sea of Green.

54:24.340 --> 54:27.366
I've got a "hole" in me pocket.

54:27.443 --> 54:29.707
Where's Jeremy?

54:29.779 --> 54:31.440
He was over there.

54:31.514 --> 54:34.074
- He's not here now.
- He must've jumped ship then.

54:34.150 --> 54:37.210
He wouldn't do that.
He's our friend.

54:37.286 --> 54:40.050
Booby? Jeremy? Hillary?

54:40.123 --> 54:42.057
Where are you?

54:42.125 --> 54:44.719
Sea of Green

55:01.544 --> 55:05.446
Pepperland! A bit salty
around the edges.

55:05.515 --> 55:07.483
- Looks all dingy.
- And drab.

55:07.550 --> 55:09.279
And quiet.

55:11.821 --> 55:13.812
Safe at last.

55:13.890 --> 55:16.791
And none the worse
for our adventures.

55:16.859 --> 55:21.023
Reminiscent in many ways
of the late Mr. Ulysses.

55:24.734 --> 55:26.702
There's an eye in the apples.

55:45.188 --> 55:47.122
Hail, Beatles!

55:50.660 --> 55:55.529
Lord Mayor, sir!
I've made it. I'm back.

55:55.598 --> 55:58.260
- Who's this?
- Our lord mayor.

55:59.035 --> 56:00.798
He's been bonked.

56:00.870 --> 56:04.271
Lord Mayor, sir,
unbonk yourself.

56:05.908 --> 56:08.934
Even a little snatch of a tune
might get him up again.

56:09.011 --> 56:10.273
Let's sing.

56:10.346 --> 56:13.804
And you've got time to rectify

56:16.619 --> 56:19.315
Do I hear music?

56:20.590 --> 56:22.455
Do I see...

56:22.525 --> 56:24.459
Young Fred?

56:24.527 --> 56:26.791
You do, Lord Mayor.

56:27.630 --> 56:31.999
Oh, bless my metronome.

56:32.068 --> 56:34.502
And did you bring help?

56:34.570 --> 56:36.936
Yes, look!

56:37.006 --> 56:40.840
Holy pizzicato, young Fred!

56:42.311 --> 56:44.245
It's quite uncanny.

56:44.313 --> 56:47.476
- Your faces...
- We're quite cute, really.

56:47.550 --> 56:50.485
You could pass
for the originals.

56:50.553 --> 56:52.384
We are the originals.

56:52.455 --> 56:56.551
No. Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.

56:56.626 --> 56:58.787
They couldn't be much
with a name like that.

56:58.861 --> 57:00.123
Sergeant Pepper?

57:00.196 --> 57:04.633
You could impersonate them
and rally the land to rebellion.

57:07.270 --> 57:09.864
Where are your instruments?

57:09.939 --> 57:13.170
- Lost in the monstrous sea.
- Sea of Monsters.

57:13.242 --> 57:15.802
We'll get other instruments,
Lord Mayor.

57:15.878 --> 57:17.641
Not a chance.

57:17.713 --> 57:22.207
The Meanies captured everything
that maketh music.

57:22.351 --> 57:24.342
They hate music that much, do they?

57:24.420 --> 57:27.981
They shrink at the very sound.

57:38.601 --> 57:42.867
Okay, you guys,
it's shrinking time in Pepperland.

59:34.550 --> 59:36.745
Aim! Fire!

01:00:24.033 --> 01:00:26.558
He reminds me of
my old English teacher.

01:00:26.635 --> 01:00:29.365
Look, if you must shout,
shout quietly.

01:00:29.438 --> 01:00:31.998
- What do we do?
- Coagulate with the crowd.

01:00:32.074 --> 01:00:35.271
Cutouts at the ready?
Then let's cut out.

01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:55.592
What a grand bandstand.

01:00:55.664 --> 01:00:58.394
- That's where the gear's kept. Come.
- Cavey.

01:01:22.525 --> 01:01:25.255
Right. The coast is clear.

01:01:25.327 --> 01:01:27.693
- Now's our chance.
- But how will we get over...

01:01:27.763 --> 01:01:29.890
Easy. Follow me.

01:01:41.143 --> 01:01:43.737
Aha. You fools.

01:02:11.006 --> 01:02:13.304
It's not very light in here, is it?

01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:15.809
Shh. Keep the noise down.

01:02:15.878 --> 01:02:18.608
- Look what I've found.
- It's the uniforms.

01:02:18.681 --> 01:02:21.343
- Nice bit of gear.
- They'll look great on, won't "dey"?

01:02:21.417 --> 01:02:25.251
- "Dey" will, won't "dey?"
- Won't "dey, dough?"

01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:27.846
- How do I look?
- Groovy.

01:02:27.923 --> 01:02:29.857
Hey, how about me?

01:02:29.925 --> 01:02:34.021
- It's a bad scene. We're surrounded.
- Oh, heck.

01:02:35.097 --> 01:02:37.463
A million billion Meanies.

01:02:40.135 --> 01:02:42.069
Hey, they're comin' this way.

01:02:42.137 --> 01:02:44.037
Hide!

01:03:21.377 --> 01:03:23.743
Do you think they heard us?

01:03:23.812 --> 01:03:25.746
What did you say?

01:03:25.814 --> 01:03:27.475
Good plan.

01:03:49.238 --> 01:03:51.399
Hey, look! They're all asleep.

01:03:51.473 --> 01:03:53.703
They look cute
when they're asleep.

01:03:53.776 --> 01:03:55.937
- Almost human.
- Let's get out of here.

01:03:56.011 --> 01:03:57.273
On tiptoe.

01:04:02.184 --> 01:04:04.482
Tiptoe through the Meanies.

01:04:10.592 --> 01:04:12.856
Oh, let's "exude."

01:05:16.658 --> 01:05:18.819
Relax, lads.
Not a Meanie in sight.

01:05:18.894 --> 01:05:21.590
- Not even a teeny Meanie.
- Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.

01:05:21.663 --> 01:05:24.131
- Great.
- Look, breakfast!

01:05:24.199 --> 01:05:26.599
I'm dying for a bit of "brekky."

01:05:30.539 --> 01:05:32.131
Look out.

01:05:37.746 --> 01:05:40.715
- Sound off.
- A-one, two, three, four.

01:05:42.418 --> 01:05:45.353
- One, two, three, four...
- Five.

01:05:46.221 --> 01:05:47.813
Five?

01:05:50.092 --> 01:05:52.322
Sound off.

01:05:52.394 --> 01:05:54.658
- A-one, two, three...
- Four.

01:05:57.833 --> 01:05:59.698
- Three?
- Two.

01:06:00.769 --> 01:06:02.703
- One.
- One?

01:06:03.972 --> 01:06:06.167
Are you, uh, bluish?

01:06:07.443 --> 01:06:09.741
You don't look bluish.

01:06:09.812 --> 01:06:11.404
Run for it!

01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:36.831
Right, men. We've made it.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.365
- Instruments at the ready.
- Okay, on the beat.

01:06:40.442 --> 01:06:43.434
A-one, a-two, a-three,
a-four, a-five, a-six...

01:06:43.512 --> 01:06:45.377
Hey, can't you make it three?

01:06:45.447 --> 01:06:48.007
Oh, all right.
On the beat of three.

01:06:48.083 --> 01:06:50.142
A-one, a-two, a-three.

01:07:00.129 --> 01:07:02.097
It was 20 years ago today

01:07:02.164 --> 01:07:05.622
Sergeant Pepper
taught the band to play

01:07:05.701 --> 01:07:07.692
They've been going in
and out of style

01:07:07.769 --> 01:07:10.465
But they're guaranteed
to raise a smile

01:07:10.539 --> 01:07:12.905
So may I introduce to you

01:07:12.975 --> 01:07:15.569
The act you've known
for all these years

01:07:15.644 --> 01:07:19.637
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band

01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:38.330
We're Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.301
We hope you will enjoy the show

01:07:43.639 --> 01:07:48.440
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:51.536
Sit back and let the evening go

01:08:03.592 --> 01:08:05.924
It's wonderful to be here

01:08:05.994 --> 01:08:08.087
It's certainly a thrill

01:08:08.163 --> 01:08:10.688
You're such a lovely audience

01:08:10.766 --> 01:08:13.257
We'd like to
take you home with us

01:08:13.335 --> 01:08:15.496
We'd love to take you home

01:08:15.571 --> 01:08:18.095
I don't really
want to stop the show

01:08:18.173 --> 01:08:20.505
But I thought you might
like to know

01:08:20.576 --> 01:08:23.100
That the singer's going
to sing a song

01:08:23.178 --> 01:08:25.772
And he wants you all
to sing along

01:08:25.846 --> 01:08:28.145
So let me introduce to you

01:08:28.216 --> 01:08:30.582
The one and only Billy Shears

01:08:30.652 --> 01:08:34.587
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band

01:08:40.895 --> 01:08:44.854
Billy

01:08:44.933 --> 01:08:47.367
Shears

01:08:49.438 --> 01:08:52.999
What would you think
if I sang out of tune

01:08:53.075 --> 01:08:56.475
Would you stand up
and walk out on me

01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:01.774
Lend me your ears
and I'll sing you a song

01:09:12.394 --> 01:09:15.386
The hills are alive...

01:09:15.464 --> 01:09:18.591
With the sound of music

01:09:25.407 --> 01:09:27.671
Music!

01:09:27.743 --> 01:09:32.270
Who is responsible for this?

01:09:33.448 --> 01:09:35.712
Rimsky-Korsakov?

01:09:48.029 --> 01:09:50.555
Guy Lombardo?

01:09:54.036 --> 01:09:58.632
My dear friend...

01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:03.801
let us not forget...

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.212
that heaven...

01:10:07.282 --> 01:10:09.682
is blue.

01:10:09.751 --> 01:10:12.379
Tomorrow the world!

01:10:12.454 --> 01:10:15.753
Bring in...

01:10:15.824 --> 01:10:20.124
my "bloopers."

01:10:26.902 --> 01:10:28.494
Who?

01:10:46.822 --> 01:10:49.086
There you are.

01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:54.926
My little glovey dovey.

01:10:56.264 --> 01:10:59.961
Go, get thee hence...

01:11:00.035 --> 01:11:03.664
and destroy an upstart.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:08.007
Smash them, squash them...

01:11:08.076 --> 01:11:11.307
thrash them!

01:11:14.049 --> 01:11:19.385
"O-blue-terate" them!

01:11:30.499 --> 01:11:33.229
Here, Your Blueness,
have some nasty medicine.

01:11:39.207 --> 01:11:41.141
Glove, Glove.

01:11:42.544 --> 01:11:44.068
Glove?

01:11:50.952 --> 01:11:53.546
He's a clever lad, isn't he?

01:11:55.957 --> 01:11:58.517
Open your mouth, love.
It won't hurt.

01:11:58.593 --> 01:12:01.153
John, you haven't half
got a big mouth, haven't you?

01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:03.459
It's easy.
All you need is love.

01:12:27.389 --> 01:12:30.654
Love, love, love

01:12:46.408 --> 01:12:48.808
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

01:12:50.212 --> 01:12:53.306
Nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

01:12:55.016 --> 01:12:58.543
Nothing you can say
but you can learn how to play the game

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:00.281
It's easy

01:13:03.959 --> 01:13:06.189
All you need is love

01:13:17.939 --> 01:13:20.203
Love is all you need

01:13:21.843 --> 01:13:24.607
There's nothing you can know
that isn't known

01:13:25.881 --> 01:13:28.816
Nothing you can see
that isn't shown

01:13:29.985 --> 01:13:33.421
There's nowhere you can be
that isn't where you're meant to be

01:13:33.488 --> 01:13:35.080
It's easy

01:13:38.627 --> 01:13:40.925
All you need is love

01:13:40.996 --> 01:13:43.123
All together now!

01:13:45.467 --> 01:13:47.025
Everybody.

01:13:52.207 --> 01:13:54.141
Love is all you need

01:14:05.987 --> 01:14:07.750
Go, Glove.

01:14:07.822 --> 01:14:09.687
Lovely Glove.

01:14:09.758 --> 01:14:13.023
You took the words
right out of me mouth, John.

01:14:13.094 --> 01:14:15.221
Hey, wait and watch.

01:14:17.165 --> 01:14:19.326
It's all in the mind, you know.

01:14:49.998 --> 01:14:53.729
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:15:01.643 --> 01:15:04.703
Hey, that's a funny place
to leave a goldfish bowl.

01:15:09.017 --> 01:15:11.918
- In Pepperland all things are possible.
- It's not a goldfish bowl.

01:15:11.987 --> 01:15:14.285
- Just a big glass bowl.
- It's "blue glass."

01:15:14.356 --> 01:15:16.449
It must be from Kentucky.

01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:24.155
- There's something inside.
- Four fellas.

01:15:24.232 --> 01:15:26.666
- What are they doing there?
- They're not having a "ball."

01:15:26.735 --> 01:15:29.499
- It's us.
- But we're here.

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:31.300
- It's Sergeant Pepper's...
- Lonely...

01:15:31.373 --> 01:15:32.863
- Hearts Club...
- Band.

01:15:32.941 --> 01:15:34.875
The resemblance
is truly striking.

01:15:34.943 --> 01:15:38.845
If I could come in here, I think
the theory put forward by Einstein...

01:15:38.913 --> 01:15:41.541
- could well be applied here.
- Any old Einstein

01:15:41.616 --> 01:15:44.676
The people in the ball are obviously
extensions of our own personalities...

01:15:44.753 --> 01:15:46.516
suspended as it were in time...

01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:50.251
frozen in space according
to the now famous theory of relativity...

01:15:50.325 --> 01:15:53.954
which, briefly explained, is simply
a matter of taking two eggs...

01:15:54.029 --> 01:15:58.022
beating lightly,
adding salt according to taste.

01:15:58.099 --> 01:16:00.363
- How do we get them out?
- Break the glass.

01:16:01.636 --> 01:16:03.263
- We can't.
- It's Beatle-proof.

01:16:03.338 --> 01:16:05.932
- Nothing is Beatle-proof.
- Have you got your drumsticks with you?

01:16:06.007 --> 01:16:08.032
- A drum break might shatter it.
- No, I haven't.

01:16:08.109 --> 01:16:12.443
- Have a look in your pocket.
- Hey, I've got a "hole" in me pocket.

01:16:12.514 --> 01:16:15.449
I wonder if...
Yeah, it still works.

01:16:15.517 --> 01:16:17.451
Ringo, we take back all we said.

01:16:17.519 --> 01:16:20.044
- You're a genius.
- A sheer genius.

01:16:20.121 --> 01:16:22.589
I know.

01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:26.093
- Like colored telly.
- Like crystal.

01:16:26.161 --> 01:16:27.253
They're decanting.

01:16:37.672 --> 01:16:38.934
Hello, brother.

01:16:40.408 --> 01:16:43.673
Yeah, without a doubt.

01:16:43.745 --> 01:16:45.713
We're the spittin' image
of each other.

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.475
Golly, yeah.

01:16:47.549 --> 01:16:50.848
I'm led to believe that
you're an extension of my personality.

01:16:50.919 --> 01:16:52.944
Yes, I'm the alter-ego man.

01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:55.581
I am the ego-man,
goo-goo-gachoo.

01:16:55.657 --> 01:16:58.717
I'm glad you asked me that,
because as a matter of fact...

01:16:58.793 --> 01:17:00.385
there's a war on.

01:17:00.462 --> 01:17:02.987
Then brothers in war,
to the skirmish must we hence.

01:17:03.064 --> 01:17:04.326
Shall we hence?

01:17:04.399 --> 01:17:06.799
Let's not waste any more time
sitting on the "hence."

01:17:06.868 --> 01:17:09.393
Beatles to battle! Charge!

01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:31.959
We're surrounded.
Nice dog, though.

01:17:53.748 --> 01:17:55.010
Sheepdog

01:17:56.184 --> 01:17:58.652
Standing in the rain

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.654
Bullfrog

01:18:00.722 --> 01:18:03.213
Doing it again

01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:07.625
Some kind of happiness
is measured out in miles

01:18:07.695 --> 01:18:12.632
What makes you think you're
something special when you smile

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.930
Childlike

01:18:15.003 --> 01:18:17.471
No one understands

01:18:17.539 --> 01:18:19.507
Jackknife

01:18:19.574 --> 01:18:22.134
In your sweaty hands

01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:26.943
Some kind of innocence
is measured out in years

01:18:27.015 --> 01:18:30.951
You don't know what it's like
to listen to your fears

01:18:31.019 --> 01:18:34.955
You can talk to me

01:18:40.495 --> 01:18:43.692
If you're lonely
you can talk to me

01:19:11.426 --> 01:19:12.688
Big man

01:19:13.528 --> 01:19:15.894
Walking in the park

01:19:15.964 --> 01:19:17.932
Wigwam

01:19:17.999 --> 01:19:20.024
Frightened of the dark

01:19:20.869 --> 01:19:25.431
Some kind of solitude
is measured out in you

01:19:25.506 --> 01:19:29.533
You think you know me
but you haven't got a clue

01:19:29.611 --> 01:19:33.069
You can talk to me

01:19:39.053 --> 01:19:42.216
If you're lonely
you can talk to me

01:19:54.869 --> 01:19:56.200
Hey, bulldog

01:20:14.222 --> 01:20:16.417
What do you say?

01:20:18.226 --> 01:20:20.319
You know what I mean?

01:20:28.069 --> 01:20:29.434
That's it! You got it!

01:20:37.045 --> 01:20:38.512
Quiet!

01:20:51.192 --> 01:20:53.387
Jeremy, can it be you?

01:20:53.461 --> 01:20:57.363
Can it be me? I think you better
inquire of the guards...

01:20:57.432 --> 01:20:59.866
for when I was captured
they took all my cards.

01:20:59.934 --> 01:21:01.401
That's enough.

01:21:07.742 --> 01:21:09.642
The whole world's being attacked.

01:21:09.711 --> 01:21:13.943
What do you want me to do? Do you
recommend fisticuffs versus the guard?

01:21:15.049 --> 01:21:17.074
Oh, guard.

01:21:17.151 --> 01:21:18.743
Blue Meanie?

01:21:20.121 --> 01:21:22.248
Left to the nostril,
right uppercut...

01:21:22.323 --> 01:21:24.723
right to the eyebrow
and left to the gut.

01:21:33.468 --> 01:21:34.730
Come on, Ringo.

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:42.574
Get back!

01:21:43.878 --> 01:21:47.143
Once more unto the breach,
dear Meanies.

01:21:48.082 --> 01:21:50.346
You're advancing the wrong way.

01:21:50.418 --> 01:21:53.012
Retreat! Backwards!
Get back!

01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:57.654
My kingdom for a horse.

01:22:10.204 --> 01:22:13.105
I think I'll tear him up
into little pieces.

01:22:13.174 --> 01:22:15.108
He does, does he?

01:22:15.176 --> 01:22:18.839
I think I'll make
a blue-burger out of him.

01:22:18.913 --> 01:22:21.040
I don't care what you think.

01:22:22.116 --> 01:22:23.879
Oh, you don't, eh?

01:22:23.951 --> 01:22:27.887
We'll soon see about that.

01:22:31.526 --> 01:22:33.960
He does in truth
seem quite annoyed.

01:22:34.028 --> 01:22:37.361
Some reference material
before I'm destroyed.

01:22:38.633 --> 01:22:42.125
"Where ground is soft
most often grows...

01:22:42.203 --> 01:22:46.435
arise, arise, arouse a rose."

01:22:47.508 --> 01:22:49.169
A rosy nose?

01:22:50.445 --> 01:22:53.539
Speak your last piece!

01:22:53.614 --> 01:22:57.641
"Peace, peace, supplant the doom
and the gloom.

01:22:57.718 --> 01:22:59.686
Turn off what is sour...

01:22:59.754 --> 01:23:02.655
turn into a flower and bloom."

01:23:25.146 --> 01:23:28.775
First time I saw that nowhere man,
that nobody...

01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:31.182
I knew he was somebody.

01:23:31.252 --> 01:23:34.744
You're right.
Hello there, blue people.

01:23:34.822 --> 01:23:37.120
Won't you join us?

01:23:37.191 --> 01:23:40.422
Buck up and otherwise commingle.

01:23:41.529 --> 01:23:43.292
What do you say?

01:23:44.165 --> 01:23:45.598
Your Blue...

01:23:45.666 --> 01:23:48.533
I mean, Your Newness?

01:23:48.603 --> 01:23:52.061
It's no longer a blue world, Max.

01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:54.438
Where could we go?

01:23:54.509 --> 01:23:56.602
Argentina?

01:23:56.677 --> 01:23:57.939
Are you with us?

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:00.777
Will you join?

01:24:00.848 --> 01:24:02.406
Shall we?

01:24:09.056 --> 01:24:11.183
Yes, Your Newness!

01:24:16.297 --> 01:24:19.733
Ah, "yes" is a word
with a glorious ring!

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.701
A true universal, euphonious thing...

01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:26.365
engenders embracing
and chasing of blues.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.376
The very best word
for the whole world to use.

01:24:33.648 --> 01:24:36.082
Let us mix, Max.

01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:37.979
I never admitted it before...

01:24:38.052 --> 01:24:41.112
but my cousin is
the bluebird of happiness.

01:25:18.426 --> 01:25:20.792
It's all too much

01:25:27.101 --> 01:25:31.094
When I look into your eyes

01:25:31.172 --> 01:25:35.131
Your love is there for me

01:25:36.143 --> 01:25:39.510
And the more I go inside

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:43.949
The more there is to see

01:25:44.018 --> 01:25:47.920
It's all too much for me to take

01:25:47.989 --> 01:25:52.119
The love that's shining
all around here

01:25:52.193 --> 01:25:56.630
All the world is birthday cake

01:25:56.697 --> 01:26:01.066
So take a piece
but not too much

01:26:11.045 --> 01:26:14.742
Nice to have the time to take

01:26:14.815 --> 01:26:18.717
This opportunity

01:26:19.787 --> 01:26:23.416
Time for me to look at you

01:26:23.491 --> 01:26:27.359
And you to look at me

01:26:27.428 --> 01:26:32.058
It's all too much for me to see

01:26:32.133 --> 01:26:35.625
The love that's shining
all around you

01:26:35.703 --> 01:26:39.799
Everywhere it's what you make

01:26:39.874 --> 01:26:43.935
For us to take
it's all too much

01:26:46.847 --> 01:26:49.441
It's too much

01:27:11.272 --> 01:27:14.241
- Catchy tune, that?
- Can't seem to get it out of my head.

01:27:14.308 --> 01:27:16.936
- Well, shake it.
- That's what we've been doing all night.

01:27:17.011 --> 01:27:18.808
It was a great party.

01:27:18.879 --> 01:27:22.371
And we brought back lots of
lovely souvenirs. Here is the motor.

01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:24.475
And I've got a little love.

01:27:24.552 --> 01:27:26.816
And I've got a "hole"
in my pocket.

01:27:26.887 --> 01:27:29.253
- A "hole"?
- Well, half a "hole" anyway.

01:27:29.323 --> 01:27:33.157
- I gave the rest to Jeremy.
- What can he do with half a hole?

01:27:33.227 --> 01:27:36.663
Fix it to keep his mind
from wandering.

01:27:36.731 --> 01:27:38.926
Hey, look at John, will ya?

01:27:38.999 --> 01:27:41.365
What's the matter, John love,
Blue Meanies?

01:27:41.435 --> 01:27:44.734
Newer and bluer Meanies have been
sighted in the vicinity of this theater.

01:27:44.805 --> 01:27:46.739
There's only one way to go out.

01:27:46.807 --> 01:27:48.240
- How's that?
- Singing.

01:27:54.815 --> 01:27:57.215
One, two, three, four

01:27:57.284 --> 01:27:59.718
Can I have a little more
