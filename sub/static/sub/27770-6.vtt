>> I'M -- I I TOOK YOUR STAIM
WRONG BECAUSE YOU SAY GO HOME AN

11:32.793 --> 11:36.103

11:36.137 --> 11:38.655

THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE

11:38.689 --> 11:41.137
WHOLE THING IS THAT YOUR SON,
YOU MISS YOUR CHILD SO MUCH THAT

11:41.172 --> 11:42.413
YOU ARE CRYING.

11:42.448 --> 11:46.000
>> NO, I'M A SINGLE MOTHER, I'M
USED TO BEING AWAY FROM MY KID

11:54.827 --> 11:56.482
>> DO YOU THINK I'M A THREAT TO
YOU.

11:56.517 --> 11:58.896
WHAT WAS THE REAL REASON WHY I'M
NOMINATED.

11:58.931 --> 12:03.827
>> IT'S JUST PART OF THE GAME
PLAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL

12:03.862 --> 12:06.896
HAPPEN.

12:06.931 --> 12:07.862

AND I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME AND
BE WITH MY SON BEFORE IT'S TIME,

12:45.275 --> 12:48.000
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM
SAYING.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.206

>> THANK YOU FOR LISTENING T WAS
IMPORTANT TO LEER THAT UP

12:51.068 --> 12:54.586
BECAUSE IT WAS NOT CUTE.

12:54.620 --> 12:56.586

12:56.620 --> 12:57.551
>> YEAH.

12:57.586 --> 12:58.689
>> OH, THANK YOU.

12:58.724 --> 13:01.206
>> I'M GOING TO WALK OUT HERE
AND CREAM RIGHT NOW.

13:01.241 --> 13:04.172
>> WE'RE FRIENDS.

13:04.206 --> 13:10.689
OKAY.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.034
>> LEAVE THAT ON, THAT'S COOL.

13:12.068 --> 13:14.448
YOU CAN SWITCH CAMERAS?

13:14.482 --> 13:15.896
OH, YOU CAN SWITCH CAMERAS?

13:15.931 --> 13:18.034
>> MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD
YOU HOW TO DO.

13:18.068 --> 13:19.793
THIS YOU ARE GOING TO BE
ADDICTED TO IT.

13:19.827 --> 13:22.172
>> OH MY GOD, ARE YOU KIDDING
ME.

13:22.206 --> 13:23.551
KATO AND I ARE WORKING TOGETHER.

13:23.586 --> 13:25.896
WE NEED TO TEAM UP WITH SOME
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE AND

13:25.931 --> 13:27.103
START AN ALLIANCE.

13:27.137 --> 13:31.206
>> WE CAN BE UP HERE AND
FIGURING STUFF OUT.

13:31.241 --> 13:33.137
>> LOLO AND NATALIE ARE
TOGETHER.

13:33.172 --> 13:34.379
THIS IS CLEAR.

13:34.413 --> 13:37.103
IF WE TEAMED UP WITH THEM, NO
ONE WILL EVER SUSPECT IT, THIS

13:37.137 --> 13:38.896
WILL BE PERFECT.

13:38.931 --> 13:44.482
>> HERE'S THE THING, THE FOUR OF
US, YOU AND NATALIE, KATO AND I.

13:44.517 --> 13:45.793
>> YEAH.

13:45.827 --> 13:48.517
>> WE CAN BASICALLY CONTROL WHAT
IS GOING TO HAPPEN AS LONG AS WE

13:48.551 --> 13:53.275
ALL VOTE THE SAME TOGETHER, WITH
A PLAN, WE CAN RUN THIS.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.965
>> YEAH.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.448
>> BUT ACTUAL FOUR, FINAL FOUR
ALLIANCE.

13:57.482 --> 14:00.034
>> FROM THIS POINT ON WE HAVE
NUMBERS, THAT IS WHY IT IS

14:00.068 --> 14:01.344
SMART.

14:01.379 --> 14:03.517
>> ME AND NATIONAL ALL WREE ARE
JUST TIRED OF JUST REALLY TRYING

14:03.551 --> 14:06.275
TO HAVE AN ALLIANCE AND THEN
IT'S NOT WORKING OUT.

14:06.310 --> 14:09.517
I HAD AN ORIGINAL ALLIANCE WITH
JONATHAN AND RYAN.

14:09.551 --> 14:10.827
THEY KIND OF TURNED ON US.

14:10.862 --> 14:12.103
SO THEN WE PIVOTED.

14:12.137 --> 14:15.862
WE HAD A ROOM ALLIANCE AND NOW
WE ARE PIVOTING TO TOM AND KATO.

14:15.896 --> 14:19.275
>> WE WANT THIS ALLIANCE TO
FINALLY WORK.

14:19.310 --> 14:20.137
WE'RE TEAM PLAYERS.

14:20.172 --> 14:22.000
WE WANT AN ALLIANCE.

14:22.034 --> 14:27.034
>> IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

14:27.068 --> 14:30.793
>> YES.

14:30.827 --> 14:32.379
>> WHOSE PIZZA S THAT YOUR
PIZZA.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.000
>> YEAH.

14:33.034 --> 14:34.448
>> HOW MUCH TIME IS LEFT?

14:34.482 --> 14:35.689
>> EIGHT MINUTES.

14:35.724 --> 14:39.068
>> IT IS GOING TO BE A LOT
LONGER THAN EIGHT MINUTES,

14:39.103 --> 14:40.241
DARLING.

14:40.275 --> 14:42.275
>> I WANT TO SOLIDIFY THIS
FOURSOME SO I WANT TO TELL THE

14:42.310 --> 14:46.034
GIRLS IT PLAN TO BACK DOOR RYAN.

14:46.068 --> 14:47.413
>> SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

14:47.448 --> 14:50.000
>> AND IF THEY GO FOR T IT
SHOULD REALLY INCREASE OUR

14:50.034 --> 14:50.862
TRUST.

14:50.896 --> 14:53.068
AND WE WILL BECOME STRONGER AS A
GROUP.

14:53.103 --> 14:55.655
>> SO LET ME JUST THROW THIS OUT
THERE.

14:55.689 --> 15:00.724
IF YOU WERE TO SAY RIGHT NOW
OUTSIDE OF THE FOUR OF US RIGHT,

15:00.758 --> 15:04.724
WHO THE MOST LIKELY PERSON TO
WIN THE SEASON OF "BIG BROTHER"

15:04.758 --> 15:06.000
IS.

15:06.034 --> 15:13.034
>> RYAN LOCHTE, HE IS LIKABLE,
AND ANYBODY AT THE END IS TBING

15:13.068 --> 15:14.896
TO BE LIKE RYAN.

15:14.931 --> 15:16.137
>> I AGREE.

15:16.172 --> 15:25.620
>> AT THIS MOMENT, THE PERFECT
STORY WOULD BE BACK DOOR RYAN.

15:25.655 --> 15:26.689
>> I'M DOING IT.

15:26.724 --> 15:28.448
I'M DOING IT FOR US FOUR.

15:28.482 --> 15:29.241
>> YES.

15:29.275 --> 15:31.103
>> I'M IN FOR US FOUR, THAT'S
IT.

15:31.137 --> 15:34.551
THAT IS THE PERFECT SCENARIO.

15:34.586 --> 15:35.379
>> SORRY.

15:35.413 --> 15:37.068
OLYMPIC MEDALIST, BUT YOU GOT TO
GO.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.103
YOU ARE TOO GOOD AND THIS IS THE
TIME TO DO IT.

15:40.137 --> 15:42.413
>> WE HAVE A AND B RIGHT NOW.

15:42.448 --> 15:46.379
A IS OBVIOUSLY WE BAG DOOR RYAN.

15:46.413 --> 15:51.379
B IS EITHER TAMAR OR.

15:51.413 --> 15:53.482
>> BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN RYAN
WINS THE VETO.

15:53.517 --> 15:59.103
>> WHAT UP?

15:59.137 --> 16:00.586
>> OOO.

16:00.620 --> 16:03.586
>> WAS THE SLIDING DOOR OPEN
BECAUSE RYAN JUST STUCK HIS HEAD

16:03.620 --> 16:06.241
OUT AND HE DOESN'T LOOK TOO
HAPPY.

16:06.275 --> 16:08.827
DID RYAN TALK ABOUT HEARING US
TALK ABOUT BACK DOORING HIM.

16:08.862 --> 16:12.655
>> DO YOU WANT TO COME OUT AND
HAVE A CUP OF TEA.

16:12.689 --> 16:14.655
>> I'M GETTING READY FOR BED.

16:14.689 --> 16:17.137
>> JUST SHUT THE DOOR.

16:17.172 --> 16:19.206
>> IT'S PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA
FOR THE FOUR OF US TO HANG OUT

16:19.241 --> 16:21.448
TOGETHER.

16:21.482 --> 16:22.620
>> TOTALLY.

16:22.655 --> 16:25.931
>> KATO, YOU THINK ARE YOU
SLICK, HUH.

16:25.965 --> 16:26.551
UH-HUH.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.482
NOPE, NOPE, NOPE.

16:27.517 --> 16:29.034
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

16:29.068 --> 16:34.586
HIS PLAN IS TO BACK DOOR ME AND
GET ME OUT OF THE "BIG BROTHER"

16:34.620 --> 16:35.862
HOUSE.

16:35.896 --> 16:38.551
AND THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE
I'M SAFE IN THIS HOUSE IS TO WIN

16:38.586 --> 16:44.137
THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

16:44.172 --> 16:51.034
>> IF WE WIN THE POWER OF VETO
EVERYTHING IS LIKE AGO.

16:51.068 --> 16:53.310
>> OUR FOURSOME IS STRENGTH.

16:53.344 --> 16:54.206
>> ABSOLUTELY.

16:54.241 --> 16:55.241
WE JUST CAN'T LET PEOPLE KNOW
ABOUT IT.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.275
>> WHAT?

16:56.310 --> 17:01.172
>> HE CAN JUST CAN'T LET PEOPLE
KNOW IT EXISTS.

17:01.206 --> 17:03.551
>> YEAH.

17:03.586 --> 17:08.620
>> KATO, LOLO AND NATALIE AND
TOM ARE IN AN ALLIANCE AM THEY

17:08.655 --> 17:13.965
ARE COMING AFTER ME, I ALREADY
KNOW IT, THEY GOT ME GO.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.275
SO YOU CAN'T TRUST LOLO, YOU
CAN'T TRUST NATALIE, YOU CAN'T

17:17.310 --> 17:21.482
TRUST KATO AND TOM.

17:21.517 --> 17:24.965
>> HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE IN THE
HOUSE.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.586
>> WE BASICALLY CAN TRUST YOU
AND ME.

17:29.620 --> 17:37.034
WITHIN'S IN GOOD SHAPE.

17:37.068 --> 17:40.034
>> YOU DON'T HAVE KETCHUP IN MOI
MORE.

17:40.068 --> 17:41.482
>> NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:41.517 --> 17:42.137
>> NO, WE DO.

17:42.172 --> 17:43.034
YOU NEED KETCHUP.

17:43.068 --> 17:45.137
>> I GOT A QUESTION.

17:45.172 --> 17:48.206
YOU KNOW MAN TO MARNTION I WANT
A STRAIGHT UP, LIKE I'M NOT

17:48.241 --> 17:50.517
GOING TO BE OH, I FRIKIN HATE
YOU.

17:50.551 --> 17:52.896
DO I NEED TO START GETTING
PACKED UP?

17:52.931 --> 17:57.758
>> ME TOO, DO I NEED TO PACK?

17:57.793 --> 17:59.482
>> I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

17:59.517 --> 18:03.275
>> I'M NOT GOING TO BE LIKE
DUDE, I HATE HATE YOU SO MUCH.

18:03.310 --> 18:06.344
>> OBVIOUSLY, I NEED TO KNOW IF
I HAVE TO GET PACKED THAT IS MY

18:06.379 --> 18:07.620
OCD.

18:07.655 --> 18:12.206
>> IF ME AND HIM DON'T WIN THE
VETO AND IT GETS USED ONE OF US

18:12.241 --> 18:13.379
COULD PROBABLY GUP.

18:13.413 --> 18:17.103
>> THERE IS A CHANCE, IT COULD
HAPPEN.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.931
I'M NOT POSITIVE WITH EVERYTHING
THAT IS GOING ON.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.034
IT'S UP TO VETO.

18:20.068 --> 18:21.310
IF I WAS IN YOUR POSITION.

18:21.344 --> 18:26.448
>> LIKE BETWEEN YOU GUYS T WOULD
BE, IT WOULD BE A COIN TOSS SO

18:26.482 --> 18:31.620
IT WOULD BE LIKE-- THAT'S IT.

18:31.655 --> 18:32.379
>> THANK, KATO.

18:32.413 --> 18:34.758
>> THANKS FOR YOUR HONESTY.

18:34.793 --> 18:37.068
>> AFTER THIS CONVERSATION I
THINK IT JUST CONFIRMED WHAT

18:37.103 --> 18:38.344
RYAN AND I WERE FEELING.

18:38.379 --> 18:42.137
I THINK TARGET NUMBER ONE AND
TWO IS PROBABLY RYAN AND I RIGHT

18:42.172 --> 18:43.241
NOW.

18:43.275 --> 18:46.620
WINNING THE VETO WOULD ALLOW ME
TO KEEP MYSELF SAFE.

18:46.655 --> 18:48.689
I WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO PROTECT
RYAN.

18:48.724 --> 18:54.620
SO THE GOAL IS DEFINITELY TO WIN
THE VETO.

18:54.655 --> 18:55.931
>> SO NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.275
>> WE HAVE TO WIN THE VETO.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.172
BETWEEN ME OR YOU.

18:59.206 --> 19:03.586
>> AND WE KEEP A T THE EXACT
SAME.

19:03.620 --> 19:04.827
>> I'M SCREWED.

19:04.862 --> 19:10.206
>> IF I DON'T GET PICKED TO PLAY
THE VETTOR COMPETITION, MOST

19:10.241 --> 19:12.586
LIKELY I'M GOING TO GET BACK
DOORED.

19:12.620 --> 19:17.241
BUT THAT BUILDS A LITTLE FIRE IN
ME, ONCE I GET THAT FAIR GOING,

19:17.275 --> 19:18.413
WHOOO, CAN'T PUT ME OUT.

19:18.448 --> 19:24.241
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S WIN THE
VETO.

19:24.275 --> 19:27.206
>> Julie: UP NEXT, IT'S THE
LIVE VETO COMPETITION.

19:27.241 --> 19:31.034
WHO WILL WIN IT AND WILL IT BE
USED TO SAVE ONE OF THE

19:31.068 --> 19:32.275
NOMINEES.

19:32.310 --> 19:35.551

>> YES.

38:34.758 --> 38:35.655

OF THE ALLIANCE THAT WE THOUGHT

38:52.551 --> 38:53.655
WE HAD.

38:53.689 --> 38:57.379
AND THEY WENT TO KATO AND TOM
AND THAT'S WHAT STARTED

38:57.413 --> 38:58.379
EVERYTHING.

38:58.413 --> 38:59.620
AND THEY KIND OF JUST STARTED
PUSHING ME OUT.

WAS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THEM.

>> Julie: WELL, YOU WERE
THINKING OF TARGETING LOLO WHEN
