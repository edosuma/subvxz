"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.833 --> 00:42.067
in a court of law.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.300
Deputy Eta:
-My dad's been working for
the Sheriff' Office since 1991.

00:46.333 --> 00:50.733
He's paved the way for me
to follow suit behind him
and help me succeed.

00:50.767 --> 00:55.133
You know, of course, I still
establish myself
as my own Deputy,

00:55.167 --> 01:01.733
but he taught me to strive
and persist and make every day
the best I can.

01:01.767 --> 01:07.500
I see somebody walking
from the corner
of that Walgreen's.

01:07.533 --> 01:09.500
-Dispatcher:
4-3 on North Grant.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.667
-What's goin' on, man?
What's that you handed them
in there?

01:18.700 --> 01:19.900
-No, he just gave me this.

01:19.933 --> 01:22.467
-What is that?
-This is... that fake weed.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.200
-He buyin' it, you got it
from him?

01:24.233 --> 01:26.133
-No, I ain't buy it,
he just gave it to me.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.533
I asked him to.
-Come over here.

01:30.167 --> 01:32.700
Wait over there for me.

01:32.733 --> 01:34.167
-What? I didn't do nothin'.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.333
-Come over here for me.

01:36.367 --> 01:38.467
Who gave you this?
The one in the front
or the back?

01:38.500 --> 01:40.100
-In the front seat.
-In the front?

01:40.133 --> 01:42.267
-Yeah.
-Okay. Come out the car,
old school.

01:42.300 --> 01:45.133
I'm puttin' you in cuffs too.
-What I do?

01:45.167 --> 01:46.300
-We're about to find out.

01:46.333 --> 01:47.567
2-8, I'm under control.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.067
I have four-- no!

01:54.267 --> 01:57.067
-Freeze! Going to
Avero and Winnie!

01:57.067 --> 02:00.633
-(radio chatter)

02:06.167 --> 02:09.067
-Edward 2-8!
I'm still
running southbound.

02:09.100 --> 02:12.867
At the boulevard.
Cross over 1960.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.200
Get on the ground!

02:18.067 --> 02:20.733
Get on the ground!

02:20.767 --> 02:24.500
-(indistinct)

02:27.233 --> 02:28.433
-Get on the ground.

02:28.467 --> 02:30.700
Give me your hand.

02:38.933 --> 02:40.500

02:41.933 --> 02:42.933

-I'm sorry.

02:42.967 --> 02:45.067
-Turn around!
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

02:45.067 --> 02:46.500
Give me your hand.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.633
-I can't breathe, sir.
-No!

02:48.667 --> 02:50.800
-I'm not gonna get up, sir.
-Give me your other hand.

02:50.833 --> 02:52.600
-I can't breathe.
-Turn around!

02:52.633 --> 02:55.767
No! You get up,
I'm bustin' you.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.900
-I'm not gonna get up.

02:57.933 --> 03:00.700
-Edward 2-8.
I'm behind the Shell station.
-Please.

03:00.733 --> 03:02.467
North side of Eller.
-Please, sir.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.300
-No.
-I can't breathe.

03:05.333 --> 03:08.067
I can't breathe.
Please, sir, I'm not
gonna run.

03:10.333 --> 03:13.233
I'm just scared.
That's all, sir.

03:14.333 --> 03:19.467
I swore... I just, I just--
I panicked, sir.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.900
Edward 2-8, I have him,
slow down.

03:21.933 --> 03:25.467
-Please, please, sir.
I got kids at the house.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.067
-What's up, man?
-He makin' me run.

03:27.100 --> 03:28.467
-I can't go to jail.
-Get up, man.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.900
-My kids is at the house.
Please, sir. Sir?
I'm on probation.

03:32.933 --> 03:35.667
I just got outta jail, sir.
-Are you sure you're okay?

03:35.700 --> 03:37.367
-Yeah, I'm good,
I'm just winded.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.600
I just need to catch my breath.

03:38.633 --> 03:40.600
-We've arrested him before.

03:40.633 --> 03:43.067
You remember me?
Why you runnin', man?

03:43.067 --> 03:46.167
-(indistinct)
-Leave your feet inside.
You already got me pissed.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.100
-I apologize,
I'm on probation, sir.
And I had somebody--

03:49.133 --> 03:52.800
-Probation? For what?
-From uh, for an uh, possession
of controlled substances.

03:52.833 --> 03:56.400
So why are you running?
-Because I thought I was going
to jail for dealing the kush

03:56.433 --> 04:00.133
for my old buddy.
-All that was gonna be
a possibility.

04:00.167 --> 04:02.600
Now it's a for sure
you're goin' to jail.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.300
-Please, sir...
-That's your fault.

04:04.333 --> 04:06.133
-I didn't know, sir.
-Why you didn't know?

04:06.167 --> 04:08.467
-I'd never been--
-You don't know runnin'
from the police...

04:08.500 --> 04:11.167
-I never been in that
predicament before, sir.
I was just scared.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.433
I never been in that predicament
before, sir, I was just scared,
I did--

04:14.467 --> 04:17.300
-All I was doin' was stoppin'
and talkin' to y'all.
-I didn't know, sir.

04:17.333 --> 04:22.233
Please, sir.
I didn't know, sir.
-All right, sit back, man.

04:22.267 --> 04:26.767
-Is that car still there?
-Dispatcher: Yes. I have one of
your suspects detained as well.

04:26.800 --> 04:31.167
-Kush is a synthetic marijuana
fabricated in the lab

04:31.200 --> 04:33.767
to mimic the side effects
of marijuana.

04:33.800 --> 04:37.133
We're finding another one
that was running
from us earlier.

04:37.167 --> 04:41.167
Why you leave?
How'd you end up over here?

04:41.200 --> 04:44.533
Turn around for me.
Where you ditch it at?
-Ditch what?

04:44.567 --> 04:46.700
-You smell like,
you smell like that kush.

04:46.733 --> 04:48.700
-Not worth it.
-You work?

04:48.733 --> 04:51.067
-I do (indistinct).
-Did you smoke it already?

04:51.067 --> 04:54.333
-I smoke cigars, man.
-Cigars don't smell
like kush, man.

04:54.367 --> 04:56.067
You found it?
-Is that the bag?

04:56.067 --> 04:57.933
-Yeah.
-That's where he tossed it
as soon as he came over--

04:57.967 --> 05:01.067
-Just tossed it as soon
as he came. The same bag.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.867
-That yours?
-No, ma'am.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.633
-It looks just like
the same one I pulled
from over there.

05:05.667 --> 05:08.100
-I don't know.
-Along with that bag
right there.

05:08.133 --> 05:11.533
That's a couple of bags
over there, so--
-A lot of bags over there.

05:11.567 --> 05:15.633
-Yeah.
-And you smell just like it.

05:15.667 --> 05:18.433
Just sit back, we'll
let you know what's goin' on,
all right?

05:21.067 --> 05:23.767
So, tell me, what was up, man?
What was goin' on today?

05:23.800 --> 05:27.267
-The new people,
I met them.
-Met 'em where?

05:27.300 --> 05:31.133
-Here, I washed the car,
and then the wheels.
I done the inside,

05:31.167 --> 05:34.833
I got all the stuff out there,
everything. That's what I did
over here,

05:34.867 --> 05:37.200
you can check my hands
and all...
-Okay. Well, okay.

05:37.233 --> 05:40.367
How you know that guy
that ran from me?
-I don't know him...

05:40.400 --> 05:43.300
-You don't know him?
so why is he telling me
that you gave him that?

05:43.333 --> 05:47.667
-Not from me, no way from me.
I ain't been here about three
and a half four months.

05:47.700 --> 05:51.500
-So why is it that he gives me
a bag of kush, sayin'
that you gave it to him

05:51.533 --> 05:54.067
and that same bag of kush
we find by you.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.967
-I wasn't tryin' to do that,
I wasn't tryin' to run,
I'm sobered up, cleaned up,

05:57.067 --> 05:59.533
-If you weren't turned around,
why didn't we find you
back over here?

05:59.567 --> 06:03.067
-The young lady right there
with the other dude right here.
She's-- there for a while

06:03.067 --> 06:06.200
then left, that...
right there, my stuff's
behind there, y'all know me.

06:06.233 --> 06:10.300
I'm sick, I'm disabled anyway.
-Where you stay at?

06:10.333 --> 06:12.833
-I stay right at that bush
right there.

06:12.867 --> 06:15.067
-So you sleep over here
in the bush?
-Yeah.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.400
-Okay.
If everything checks out,
you're gonna be good to go.

06:17.433 --> 06:19.533
Just sit back, we'll
let you know what's goin' on,
all right?

06:19.567 --> 06:20.600
-Yes, sir.

06:22.133 --> 06:25.400
You are going to jail
for evading detention
and resisting arrest.

06:25.433 --> 06:27.467
-You understand?
-What's evadin'--

06:27.500 --> 06:29.900
-Evadin' detention...
when I'm tryin' to put
handcuffs on you,

06:29.933 --> 06:32.400
and I'm telling you
numerous times to stop,

06:32.433 --> 06:34.700
and you disregarded
all my commands,
and you continued to run,

06:34.733 --> 06:39.300
havin' me to chase you,
that's evading detention
and arrest, all right?

06:39.333 --> 06:42.367
-Yes, sir.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.500
He already told you
what's goin' on, right?

06:44.533 --> 06:47.567
-Just wait, listen, y'all know
I don't break it
and I don't steal nothin'...

06:47.600 --> 06:51.067
-Okay.
-I'm a bum, actually,
but I try to work (bleep),

06:51.067 --> 06:53.333
I hold signs
and all that stuff...
-I got you.

06:53.367 --> 06:55.667
-I'm just sayin'
while waitin' on my housing.
-Okay.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.467
We're giving you
a criminal trespass warning.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.233
From here on out,
just be warned, we're gonna be
high presence in the area.

07:04.133 --> 07:07.167
Officer Smith:
You know, police work was never
what I intended on doing.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.800
But I always knew
that I wanted to do something

07:08.833 --> 07:12.500
that was civil service,
where I could actually
get out and help people

07:12.533 --> 07:14.267
in the public
and in the community.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.333
I like being able to go out
and talk to people
on a daily basis,

07:17.367 --> 07:20.700
figure out
where they're coming from,
and what they need

07:20.733 --> 07:23.900
that can, that can help them out
in the long run.

07:23.933 --> 07:29.533
We got a call from a neighbor
over here who says
that his neighbors

07:29.567 --> 07:34.067
are out in their front yard
havin' a physical argument.

07:34.100 --> 07:38.333
So we're gonna go over here
and see what the disturbance
is about.

07:43.167 --> 07:47.333
-3282, we're gonna be
up at D Delta.

07:47.367 --> 07:50.700
(knocking on door)

07:50.733 --> 07:53.333
-What is it?
-Police department.

07:53.367 --> 07:56.200
-We're okay, officers.
We're fine.
-Okay, can you open the--

07:56.233 --> 07:57.733
-Why don't you come out here
and tell me that?

07:57.767 --> 07:58.933
-We're just fine.

07:58.967 --> 08:01.600
-Who else in there with you?
-Don't look at me.

08:01.633 --> 08:06.933
-Hey, was somebody in there
callin' for you?
-Travis, get him off.

08:13.633 --> 08:16.067
-Open the door!
-Wait a minute!

08:16.100 --> 08:18.900
-Open the door now!
Let me see your hands.

08:18.933 --> 08:22.733
-He's tryin' to.
-Turn around.

08:24.800 --> 08:29.167
-Officers, he's tryin' to open
the door for y'all.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.467
We're not, we're not mean here.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.067
That's my dad.
-Okay.

08:35.067 --> 08:37.600
-And I'm his son.
-So what's goin' on?

08:37.633 --> 08:39.500
-Me and my girlfriend
are fightin'.
-Okay.

08:39.533 --> 08:41.367
-And we're serious.

08:41.400 --> 08:45.333
-This is what she did on me,
right there, back of my ear.
-No, come look at me and look

08:45.367 --> 08:49.500
at this burn.
-(indistinct)
We've had an argument

08:49.533 --> 08:51.700
and we're trying to settle it.
Dad's asked us to calm down,
we're tryin'.

08:51.733 --> 08:54.967
-Step out here.
You got ID on you?
-I do in my wallet right here.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.900
-Right here?
-Right here.

08:56.933 --> 09:01.367
-Do I have any ID?
-We been tryin' to settle
the argument for a while.

09:01.400 --> 09:05.167
-What are y'all arguin' about?
-We're arguin' about her
lyin' to me, Officer.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.600
-About her lyin' to you?
-Yes, sir.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.767
-So that turned into
a physical argument or what?

09:08.800 --> 09:11.133
-Well, yeah.
-So why wouldn't you
open the door for me?

09:11.167 --> 09:14.200
-Well, because, we're tryin'
to settle it, and we're tryin'
to have peace around here,

09:14.233 --> 09:17.233
and let everybody calm down
and have peace.

09:17.267 --> 09:19.367
-Okay.
-I'm insecure about that.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.067
A friend of our gave her
a gift, and they spend a lot
of time together now.

09:22.067 --> 09:25.233
And they have numerous
phone calls back and forth.
I just wonder why.

09:25.267 --> 09:27.333
-And then all of a sudden
y'all get in an argument.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.733
-I'm not tryin'
to hide anything.
Not at all.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.733
-Well, when she's yellin'
for me to come in,
and you're refusing

09:31.767 --> 09:36.067
to open the door...
-I'm sorry I didn't
open it fast enough.

09:36.067 --> 09:39.400
-Well, you didn't not open it
fast enough, you refused
to open it,

09:39.433 --> 09:40.700
and she's yellin'
in the room.

09:40.733 --> 09:42.733
So I'm gonna kick
that door open every time.

09:42.767 --> 09:44.367
-She'll make a complaint,
I understand.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.800
-What did you see
happen tonight?

09:45.833 --> 09:49.267
-Oh, it's just...

09:49.300 --> 09:54.767
they uh... fussed back
and forth. And one of 'em
says one thing,

09:54.800 --> 09:56.900
and the other one
says the other, and they get
in a little disagreement,

09:56.933 --> 10:00.767
and they get mad
at one another, and...
you know...

10:00.800 --> 10:05.100
-So did you see anything
happen tonight, or what?
-No, I didn't see anything...

10:05.133 --> 10:08.167
just, just arguin'.
They just argue all the time...

10:08.200 --> 10:11.600
-How did he get these...
-And that gets on my nerves.

10:11.633 --> 10:12.967
-Pop, tell him...

10:13.000 --> 10:15.100
Well, okay,
they were grabbin'...
and wrestlin'...

10:15.133 --> 10:18.900
-I was tryin' to get him off.
-Yes, she was tryin' to get him
off of her.

10:18.933 --> 10:22.533
-Pop, tell the truth, Dad.
-Hey, stop talkin'.
He's tellin' the truth now.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.300
-Tell him who came at who
first, Dad.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.467
-Travis...
-Pop, come on, Dad.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.167
-I'm gonna go in
and talk to her real quick.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.633
-I never...
-Look at my face...

10:30.667 --> 10:33.433
-So walk me through
what happened tonight.

10:33.467 --> 10:38.367
-I was in the shower, and I
just asked him if one of his
friends had called,

10:38.400 --> 10:41.867
and he said "You're (bleep)
him, you're (bleep) him,"

10:41.900 --> 10:47.033
he thinks I'm doin' all this
inside stuff. I taught school
for 20 years.

10:47.067 --> 10:50.733
-Okay.
-I'm not an aggressive person
at all.

10:50.767 --> 10:57.700
I just want him away,
he just pounds and pounds
and pounds on me,

10:57.733 --> 10:59.667
and I just...
-So what happened tonight?

10:59.700 --> 11:04.400
-Walk me through from A to B.
-I took a shower. We've been
disputing for two or three days.

11:04.433 --> 11:10.233
-Okay.
-And he thinks that I'm
screwing everything up and down

11:10.267 --> 11:12.400
the street.

11:12.433 --> 11:17.467
-So you got out of the shower
and he pushed you?
Where did he push you?

11:17.500 --> 11:20.067
-Yes, and he shoved me down.
-Shoved you down into the floor?

11:20.067 --> 11:21.700
-Yeah.
-Did he ever, like,
hit you or anything?

11:21.733 --> 11:23.633
-Yes.
-What exactly did he do?

11:23.667 --> 11:27.067
-....To my face.
-How many times did he hit you?

11:27.067 --> 11:29.400
-Two.
-Two times?
With an open fist,

11:29.433 --> 11:30.767
-Yes.
-closed fist?

11:30.800 --> 11:32.600
-Open.
-Okay.

11:32.633 --> 11:34.800
-And I just was tryin'
to get him off, I'm sure
I scratched him,

11:34.833 --> 11:39.067
but I just can't do this
anymore.
-Okay.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.267
Just wait right here
for me, okay?

11:40.300 --> 11:43.767
-Dad, tell him the truth.
-Well, I told you to shut up.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.600
-He's not asking who shut up.
Who came at who, first, Pop?
-Okay.

11:46.633 --> 11:49.667
-And tell him the truth.
-Travis, you tell the truth.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.500
-Come here.
Walk over here with me.

11:51.533 --> 11:53.067
-I will.
-All right.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.433
-But Dad, please, tell him
the truth, Dad.

11:54.467 --> 11:56.867
-Walk over here.
-Y'all gonna take me to jail?

11:56.900 --> 11:59.067
-That's what it looks like.
-Y'all takin' me to jail?

11:59.067 --> 12:00.667
-Yeah.
-Why am I goin' to jail?

12:00.700 --> 12:03.133
-For domestic assault.
-Oh, my god.
Thank you, y'all.

12:03.167 --> 12:06.600
-No, no, no, we're not
doin' that.
-I can't believe my dad's

12:06.633 --> 12:10.400
doin' this to me.
-Your dad didn't do this to you.
Okay, you did this to yourself.

12:10.433 --> 12:12.967
-He saw her attack me first.
-But here's the deal,
you did this to yourself.

12:13.067 --> 12:16.700
-How? When that big woman's
comin' at me, I can't
defend myself, y'all?

12:16.733 --> 12:19.800
I'm the one with
the burned skin
and this knot on my head.

12:19.833 --> 12:23.400
How can y'all do this to me?
She's not right.
-We're not doin' this to you.

12:23.433 --> 12:25.900
You did this to yourself.
You got yourself
in this predicament.

12:25.933 --> 12:29.600
-Defendin' myself.
Defendin' myself.
-Well, from what I see,

12:29.633 --> 12:33.900
from what she told me,
from what your dad told me...
-Y'all are liars, Dad.

12:33.933 --> 12:36.433
-That's not what happened.
-It's what happened.

12:36.467 --> 12:38.700
And then, normally the victim...
-She spit in my face
tonight.

12:38.733 --> 12:40.700
-Normally, the victim
doesn't refuse to open the door
for me.

12:40.733 --> 12:43.133
-Y'all takin' an innocent man
to jail.

12:43.167 --> 12:47.300
God, thanks, Dad!
He saw everything
that happened.

12:47.333 --> 12:51.733
And he won't tell y'all
the truth.
Bull (bleep)!

12:52.733 --> 12:54.600
Hope they die and they lie!

12:54.633 --> 12:57.633
-Don't start sayin'
that kind of stuff, man.

12:57.667 --> 13:00.267
-I hope they do.
I'm goin' to jail for no reason.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.200
I hope they die and they're
lyin' there together.

13:03.233 --> 13:05.867
Y'all takin' an innocent man
to jail again.

13:05.900 --> 13:09.267
Everybody lied for her.
I wanna press charges on her.

13:09.300 --> 13:13.200
I got knots and scratches
on me. I wanna press charges
on her.

13:13.233 --> 13:16.733
-Those appear to be
defensive wounds, okay?

13:16.767 --> 13:19.633
-I'm the one with the knot
on my head. I'm the one
with the cuts and bruises,

13:19.667 --> 13:22.400
she don't have a mark on her,
and I gotta go to jail.

13:22.433 --> 13:25.433
I defended myself, y'all.
-Because of our investigation
tonight, we believe

13:25.467 --> 13:26.867
that you were
the primary aggressor

13:26.900 --> 13:29.733
in this altercation, okay?
-Oh, my god.
(car door slams)

13:33.900 --> 13:36.200
Officer Morales:
-So I've been a police officer
here in Stockton
for about a year and a half.

13:36.233 --> 13:39.167
Grew up in Phoenix, Arizona.
I was searching for
a police department

13:39.200 --> 13:43.933
that was fast-paced,
moved up here for the job,
because the police department

13:43.967 --> 13:45.933
and the city itself,
it's a fast-paced city.

13:45.967 --> 13:48.133
You gotta be
on the go 24/7.

13:48.167 --> 13:52.233
-(radio chatter)

13:52.267 --> 13:56.167
So right now we're en route,
looks like we have a female
calling in, acting like

13:56.200 --> 14:00.400
she's talking to her service,
a cell phone provider, saying
that she needs the police

14:00.433 --> 14:02.233
and has an emergency.

14:02.267 --> 14:04.333
We're almost there
right around the corner,

14:04.367 --> 14:06.700
we're going to figure out
what's going on once
we get there.

14:06.733 --> 14:09.833
(radio chatter)

14:16.633 --> 14:17.967
-Hello.
-Hi.

14:18.067 --> 14:19.733
-What's your name?
-Rebecca.

14:19.767 --> 14:25.067
Hi, um, there's
strange people in my house
that will not seem to get out,

14:25.100 --> 14:27.900
and they're in my car.
And if you can get 'em
out of my car,

14:27.933 --> 14:29.667
I would appreciate it.

14:29.700 --> 14:33.367
-They're in your car right now?
-They're ghosts. I know
that seems so stupid

14:33.400 --> 14:37.233
and so nonsense,
(speaks Spanish)
-So you want us

14:37.267 --> 14:38.800
to get the people

14:38.833 --> 14:41.767
that aren't in your car?
-No no no no, that's not
what I'm saying,

14:41.800 --> 14:44.633
what I'm saying is,
they will not leave my house.

14:44.667 --> 14:47.833
There's kids in my backyard...
-Are you the only one
that can see this?

14:47.867 --> 14:51.433
-(speaks Spanish)
This is a first thing for me.
-Okay.

14:51.467 --> 14:54.600
-Okay, I have never experienced
nothing like this before
in my life.

14:54.633 --> 14:58.400
There's kids popping up
in the backyard. I don't know
who lived here before,

14:58.433 --> 15:03.333
but there's people in my car.
I know you can't see them,
but they will not leave.

15:03.367 --> 15:07.367
If you can s--, I tried
to get 'em out, but
they won't not leave.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.767
Look it, you see my picture
right there?
-Yes.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.533
-That's me.
-Okay.

15:11.567 --> 15:14.467
-She will not open the door.
-Okay.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.733
-Even if I unlock it.
-Okay.

15:16.767 --> 15:21.867
-And my husband...
oh my goodness, it's like,
intense, I--

15:21.900 --> 15:23.867
-How many people
are in your car right now?

15:23.900 --> 15:28.367
-Um, from what I saw,
see, look, she's moving,
do you see the car seat move?

15:28.400 --> 15:30.567
-I didn't.
-There's clearly nobody
in the car.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.433
-I'll give you
the keys to the car.

15:33.467 --> 15:34.967
-I gotta ask you this.
-Sure.

15:35.067 --> 15:38.600
-Do you do any kind
of narcotics, drugs
or anything like that?

15:38.633 --> 15:40.600
-No, never have, never will.
-No? Smoke marijuana?

15:40.633 --> 15:43.533
-No... you're more than welcome
to look inside the house...
-No, that's okay.

15:43.567 --> 15:48.300
-like, I have never
done anything but...
they will not leave this house.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.733
There is somebody trapped
inside that car as well,
this Cadillac?

15:50.767 --> 15:53.967
-Okay.
-They will not leave.
Let me put this sweater on,

15:54.067 --> 15:57.067
I'm sorry.
Babe, where'd you put the keys?

15:57.100 --> 16:00.367
-Right here.
-Hey, ma'am? Can I talk to you
out here for just a second?

16:00.400 --> 16:03.067
-Of course. Of course.
Did you want me to take my--
-Did you need--

16:03.100 --> 16:04.700
You can take your purse
if you want it.
-No. I don't need it.

16:04.733 --> 16:07.300
-Okay.

16:09.333 --> 16:12.100
Let, let's...
let's talk over here.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.900
So you've been drinking today?
-Uh, just a little bit.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.733
-Do you have any history
of mental illness
in your family?

16:16.767 --> 16:19.300
-No.
-Okay.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.200
-(laughs) Why are you
looking at me like that?
-Okay.

16:21.233 --> 16:26.133
-I was like ready to relax,
and--
-Can you just do me a favor,

16:26.167 --> 16:29.067
and I just wanna do like
a couple of tests with you
really quick?

16:29.067 --> 16:31.667
-Okay.
-So you don't use any kind
of illicit drugs,

16:31.700 --> 16:34.933
methamphetamine, anything
like that?
-No...

16:34.967 --> 16:36.933
-Okay. How many hours of sleep
did you get last night?

16:36.967 --> 16:40.500
-Um, probably like, mm,
five hours.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.833
Not the-- average.

16:42.867 --> 16:45.467
-Just go ahead and I'm just
gonna take your pulse
really quick,

16:45.500 --> 16:46.900
just relax your arm.
-Sure.

16:46.933 --> 16:49.967
-Just relax.
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

16:50.067 --> 16:53.467
-Two hours ago.
I ate a salad and a hot dog.

16:53.500 --> 16:57.333
-You may be confused right now,
but, you know, just
relax, and...

16:57.367 --> 16:59.567
-Yeah. You know, if I can get
some help, that's fine.
-Yeah, well, we're gonna

16:59.600 --> 17:01.767
have somebody come,
we're gonna have somebody come
and check you out

17:01.800 --> 17:05.600
-Yeah. I know what I saw,
I know what I seen
and everything, so...

17:05.633 --> 17:09.067
-I know. Yeah, I know.
-You think I'm a psycho person,
but I'm not.

17:09.100 --> 17:11.267
But thank you,
I appreciate you coming out.
-Okay.

17:11.300 --> 17:14.200
-So what do you think?
-Um, I think she's having
hallucinations

17:14.233 --> 17:18.800
related to being
severely malnourished, so...
and that can, you know,

17:18.833 --> 17:22.767
cause any kind of, you know,
issues with cognitive
function, so,

17:22.800 --> 17:26.400
she needs to be looked at
like immediately by
an ambulance.

17:26.433 --> 17:29.200
-So she started speaking
Spanish right off the bat
saying, "Hey, get 'em

17:29.233 --> 17:31.500
outta here. They're in there,
still, get 'em outta here."

17:31.533 --> 17:35.800
-Yeah, that's not normal, so,
she's got no injection site,
she's got nothing, so

17:35.833 --> 17:40.333
I didn't see any sign
of drug use anywhere,

17:40.367 --> 17:43.067
so, and they're saying that
she doesn't eat very often,

17:43.067 --> 17:46.133
and when she does,
it sounds like it's pretty
nutritionally sparse, too,

17:46.167 --> 17:48.400
so...
-I think we should get EMR
out here at least

17:48.433 --> 17:50.067
to check her out.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.167
I'm just gonna ask you
a couple questions.
Do you live here with them?

17:52.200 --> 17:53.933
-This is my house.
-Okay. So they live with you?

17:53.967 --> 17:56.767
-I'm her father-in-law.
-You see her every day
and she acts normal

17:56.800 --> 18:01.533
every day, and today
all of a sudden, she's just...
she's starting to see things.

18:01.567 --> 18:03.300
-Yes.
-Okay.

18:03.333 --> 18:07.467
-So I don't know what happened.
It's kind of like bipolar
or what have you.

18:07.500 --> 18:12.067
She's like seeing-- she's like,
oh, there's people outside,
there's people outside.

18:12.067 --> 18:14.200
-Yeah, she told me
there's a bunch of children
in the back there, so,

18:14.233 --> 18:17.367
obviously I don't hear
any children, but...
-There's nobody there,

18:17.400 --> 18:19.333
and then she's telling
you guys there's somebody
in her car,

18:19.367 --> 18:23.700
that she's seeing the car move.
If you like, go look
at the tire mark.

18:23.733 --> 18:26.833
Just to prove our point...
-No, I can see.

18:26.867 --> 18:30.400
-We chalked it.
We were just trying
to like convince her

18:30.433 --> 18:34.567
that there's nothing out there.
She's hallucinating.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.867
-We're gonna have the ambulance
come and check her out.
-What's your name?

18:38.900 --> 18:42.233
-Rebecca.
-Okay, Rebecca,
are you anemic?

18:42.267 --> 18:44.567
-Yes.
-Okay, so what's going on?

18:44.600 --> 18:46.800
-They think that I'm crazy,
but I'm not.

18:46.833 --> 18:50.733
I'm actually from the Bay Area,
and yeah, California.
-Any drug use today?

18:50.767 --> 18:54.200
-No, I don't do drugs,
I'm actually 27 years old,
and I've never done drugs

18:54.233 --> 18:56.500
in my entire life.
-Okay.

18:56.533 --> 18:59.500
-803?
-803.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.400
-I don't know what happened
today. It went from good
to bad.

19:11.433 --> 19:14.700
-She's gonna be taken down
to County Hospital and she's
gonna get some help, so...

19:14.733 --> 19:17.833
-She was nice at first,
and then all of a sudden
she just like flipped.

19:17.867 --> 19:19.400
-Can you show me
where you marked the vehicle?

19:19.433 --> 19:22.333
-She just started like,
"Oh, the car's moving,
the car's moving."

19:22.367 --> 19:24.600
And we're like, "No, the car's
not moving."

19:24.633 --> 19:29.067
We marked the ground on purpose,
me and my son, just to try
to ease her mind

19:29.100 --> 19:31.067
or what have you.
-Right.

19:31.067 --> 19:35.500
-Basically that was just like
to prove that the car
was not moving

19:35.533 --> 19:39.633
because she said, "There's
people in the car, there's
people in my boat,

19:39.667 --> 19:42.433
there's people in the
go kart in the back..."
There's nobody here.

19:42.467 --> 19:44.967
-Yeah. Obviously
we're not seeing
what she's seeing,

19:45.067 --> 19:47.433
so hopefully, she's gonna get
