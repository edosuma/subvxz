WEBVTT

00:00.665 --> 00:03.220
- I have snacks.
- Thank God.

00:03.460 --> 00:05.126
You're welcome.
This is a joke, right?

00:05.128 --> 00:07.028
No, we're on a bit of a
health kick.

00:07.030 --> 00:08.730
We're doing the
healthy thing now.

00:08.732 --> 00:10.498
Oh, since the "muffalo
wing" incident?

00:10.500 --> 00:12.667
No, I just love my family and

00:12.669 --> 00:16.004
I want us to eat healthy, so we
got rid of all our junk food and

00:16.006 --> 00:19.040
are taking vitamins.
All I think about is bacon.

00:19.042 --> 00:21.042
Ha-ha, married people
problems.

00:21.044 --> 00:23.311
You know, you <i>all</i> should
thank me.

00:23.313 --> 00:25.213
You're disgusting.
Yeah, but that's just our

00:25.215 --> 00:27.048
personalities, though.
Honestly, Jenny's not wrong.

00:27.050 --> 00:28.816
The only one here in decent
shape is Andre.

00:28.818 --> 00:30.652
Oh, thank you for
noticing.

00:30.654 --> 00:32.387
Would you mind giving us a
little tutorial?

00:32.389 --> 00:34.289
I mean, what have you been
doing?

00:34.291 --> 00:36.524
As a matter of fact, I can.
See, you can do everything that

00:36.526 --> 00:38.726
I do in the privacy of your own
home.

00:38.728 --> 00:40.662
I always like to start off with
a squat.

00:40.664 --> 00:43.431
It's kind of the most natural
way to kind of begin anything.

00:43.433 --> 00:45.733
Just get deep as you can go.
Drop in.

00:45.735 --> 00:47.435
What happens if you get
resistance, what do you do?

00:47.437 --> 00:49.203
You just want to push right
through it.

00:49.205 --> 00:51.573
Push, push until you can get
down, down, down, down, down,

00:51.575 --> 00:53.942
down, <i>down,</i> deep as you can, and
it's gonna hurt, you know.

00:53.944 --> 00:55.877
Okay.
But you got to just push

00:55.879 --> 00:57.779
through it and then explode.
Oh.

00:57.781 --> 00:59.747
Oh, nice.
You have a great core.

00:59.749 --> 01:01.716
Is there anything specifically
you do for that?

01:01.718 --> 01:03.851
Indeed I do.
I do a plank.

01:03.853 --> 01:06.321
So you just kind of lay down...
and take it.

01:06.323 --> 01:08.590
This is great because you're
doing two muscles at a time.

01:08.592 --> 01:10.725
Mm-hmm.
Two is about the minimum.

01:10.727 --> 01:13.127
You can always take two at once
because then you're activating

01:13.129 --> 01:14.963
two different parts of your
body.

01:14.965 --> 01:16.764
Now I'm just getting worked up
right now.

01:16.766 --> 01:18.600
Yeah.
Now, do you find yourself

01:18.602 --> 01:20.435
getting hard while this is
happening?

01:20.437 --> 01:22.770
Well, I find this whole thing

01:22.772 --> 01:25.640
is hard, but, you know, I just
got my bros to help me get

01:25.642 --> 01:27.709
through it.
Yeah, do you do it with other

01:27.711 --> 01:30.211
jacked dudes, or what?
Oh... I love doing it with

01:30.213 --> 01:32.313
jacked dudes.
No matter how many times you

01:32.315 --> 01:34.983
say, "Stop, stop, stop," they
will not let you, and then

01:34.985 --> 01:37.619
you're thankful and you're
pretty sore.

01:37.621 --> 01:40.054
Well, you seem to be exhausted.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.857
You earned this.
Oh, thank you very much.

01:42.859 --> 01:47.255
Mmm, ha-ha-ha.
Tip's got the most nerve endings.

01:47.375 --> 01:52.233
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:52.353 --> 01:54.636
Mmm... all right, I'm out.
I got to go set up for Baby

01:54.638 --> 01:56.638
Geoffrey's party.
Is it his birthday?

01:56.640 --> 01:59.240
No, it's not his birthday.
It's for his soccer team.

01:59.242 --> 02:02.276
Were they undefeated?
No, they lost every single game.

02:02.278 --> 02:04.912
Why can't kids just be losers
anymore?

02:04.914 --> 02:06.614
Well, Ruxin, you have years
of expertise.

02:06.616 --> 02:08.483
You should show 'em how.
That's right, there's a

02:08.485 --> 02:10.283
perfect example sitting right on
your mantel.

02:10.286 --> 02:14.422
Hasn't Baby Geoffrey lost
enough having Ruxin as a dad?

02:14.424 --> 02:16.357
Andre, why would say
something so purposefully

02:16.359 --> 02:18.192
hurtful?
What? I'm just...

02:18.194 --> 02:20.194
You don't know the power of
your words.

02:20.196 --> 02:22.530
I hold you in very high esteem,
and when you make fun of me, it

02:22.532 --> 02:24.465
stings.
It's a joke, we all make

02:24.467 --> 02:26.300
jokes.
Andre, we would never say

02:26.302 --> 02:28.136
something like that to you.
Mm-mm.

02:28.138 --> 02:30.104
I'm so sorry, look, he
doesn't think you're a loser...

02:30.106 --> 02:32.607
You-You know what?
It's too much.

02:32.609 --> 02:34.809
I got to get out of here and go
get supplies.

02:34.811 --> 02:36.678
Why don't you just have Sofia
get the supplies?

02:36.680 --> 02:39.714
Because, since last week was
my bye week, she's on her bye

02:39.716 --> 02:43.117
- week this week in Miami.
- Gentlemen, the word

02:43.119 --> 02:45.887
"taco" is no longer synonymous
with hot dogs and hamburgers.

02:45.889 --> 02:47.955
Taco's Truck has served its last
customer.

02:47.957 --> 02:49.957
Aw.
Oh, thank God.

02:49.959 --> 02:52.126
I know you're all upset, but
the food industry's way too

02:52.128 --> 02:54.028
complicated.
And who wants to wash their

02:54.030 --> 02:56.197
hands, like, three times a day?
Ugh.

02:56.199 --> 02:58.132
That can't be healthy.
So, what's happening with

02:58.134 --> 03:00.535
Uncle Frank's van now?
I turned Taco's Truck into a

03:00.537 --> 03:02.236
puppy petting zoo.
Oh, yeah, that makes sense,

03:02.238 --> 03:04.238
sure.
Yeah.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.040
It's the perfect business.
Hardly any overhead.

03:06.042 --> 03:08.710
All you have to do is show up at
kids' parties, bar mitzvahs,

03:08.712 --> 03:11.145
orgies, let people pet the dogs,
they give you money for it.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.214
Who would hire you to do one
of these parties?

03:13.216 --> 03:16.517
Uh, your super sexy wife.
I'm doing Baby Geoffrey's party

03:16.519 --> 03:18.352
tomorrow.

03:18.354 --> 03:20.421
Yeah.
I would rather set up a back

03:20.423 --> 03:22.256
rub station run by Jerry
Sandusky.

03:22.258 --> 03:24.425
Oh, if he's available, just
tell him to come by.

03:24.427 --> 03:26.494
Aah!
Guys, I keep onng goi through

03:26.496 --> 03:29.063
it over and over again.
I-I think I really upset Ruxin.

03:29.065 --> 03:33.167
Kevin.
You urinated all over the floor.

03:33.169 --> 03:35.269
It's not my fault that you
gave me these vitamins that

03:35.271 --> 03:37.238
change my pee color like some
sort of sick Willy Wonka trick.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.173
What?
The color is neither here nor

03:39.175 --> 03:41.242
there.
The fact is, you didn't get it

03:41.244 --> 03:43.277
in the bowl.
I got a lot of it in the

03:43.279 --> 03:45.279
bowl.
That's not that bad.

03:45.281 --> 03:47.248
Yeah, honestly, you get 70%
of it in the bowl, you're doing

03:47.250 --> 03:49.751
great.
You guys put the pee bib

03:49.753 --> 03:51.686
around the toilet?
That's genius.

03:51.688 --> 03:53.387
Yeah, you know, it catches
all the remnants.

03:53.389 --> 03:55.590
Wait, wait, the remnants?
That's a full meal.

03:55.592 --> 03:57.759
That's not a meal.
That's, that's a couple

03:57.761 --> 03:59.861
sessions' worth, Andre.
That's not one shot.

03:59.863 --> 04:03.131
Is there a diet that makes
any of you less foul?

04:03.133 --> 04:06.801
Oh! Oh.
Ah, it's not that bad, actually.

04:06.803 --> 04:08.903
Look.
"Now, what do you kids want for

04:08.905 --> 04:10.805
Christmas?"
Thanks for driving me all the

04:10.807 --> 04:12.740
way back to the city, Andre, I
appreciate it.

04:12.742 --> 04:14.909
Of course, and by the way, I
wanted to talk to you a little

04:14.911 --> 04:16.644
bit about a trade.
Do not offer me Randy Moss.

04:16.646 --> 04:18.946
I do not know why you drafted
him, I do not know why you still

04:18.947 --> 04:20.714
have him.
First of all, he can come

04:20.716 --> 04:22.583
back.
Just watch, watch, okay?

04:22.585 --> 04:24.585
Look, but I'm not talking about
that.

04:24.587 --> 04:26.921
You have great running backs.
I have a great backup QB.

04:26.923 --> 04:29.891
I got amazing wide receivers.
Let's, uh, see if we can get on

04:29.893 --> 04:31.626
the dance floor.
Do a little dance.

04:31.628 --> 04:33.294
A little trade dance, right?
It's an interesting

04:33.296 --> 04:36.597
proposition, I just... you know,
I got to come up for air first.

04:36.599 --> 04:38.332
What the hell does that mean,
"come up for air"?

04:38.334 --> 04:40.434
I'm swamped right now, man.
My work's kicking my ass, and I

04:40.436 --> 04:42.470
got a lot of stuff to do around
the house.

04:42.472 --> 04:44.438
Just a bad time, you know.
Take a second, we'll just get

04:44.440 --> 04:46.174
out our phones, we'll do it
right now.

04:46.176 --> 04:47.975
A-Andre, I can't even think
past one minute from now,

04:47.977 --> 04:50.077
honestly.
If I was gonna consider this, I

04:50.079 --> 04:51.979
would need to take a bunch of
stuff off my plate.

04:51.981 --> 04:53.781
I don't even have groceries in
my house right now.

04:53.783 --> 04:55.783
We'll get you groceries.
We'll stop at the storon the

04:55.785 --> 04:57.618
way home.
Great, here's a little list

04:57.620 --> 04:59.520
for you.
Wait, you want me to get you

04:59.522 --> 05:01.455
groceries?
Yeah, I could just crush some

05:01.457 --> 05:03.291
e-mails while you're in there if
that's cool.

05:03.293 --> 05:05.193
"Milk"?
Do you want, like, one percent,

05:05.195 --> 05:06.928
almond milk...?
Sorry, Andre, I'm just

05:06.930 --> 05:08.796
slaying some voice mails real
quick.

05:08.798 --> 05:10.464
"Salad stuff"?
What does "salad stuff" even

05:10.466 --> 05:13.201
mean?
Is that, like, the dressings or

05:13.203 --> 05:15.603
the things inside the salad?

05:18.071 --> 05:21.111
All right, Ian, here you go.
This is your trophy for not

05:21.351 --> 05:24.152
crying that one time.
On your way.

05:24.154 --> 05:26.688
Geoffrey, you're not much of a
physical specimen, but you can

05:26.690 --> 05:28.657
hoard orange slices with the
best of 'em.

05:28.659 --> 05:30.859
Here you go, bud.
Yay!

05:30.861 --> 05:32.861
Do I get a trophy?
No, sweetie, these trophies

05:32.863 --> 05:34.529
are for losers.
Go play with them.

05:34.531 --> 05:36.431
Aw.
I'm coming for you, losers.

05:36.433 --> 05:38.200
Yeah, uh, speaking of losers,
what happened to your pants

05:38.202 --> 05:40.368
there, Jackson Pollack?
Did an alien finish on you?

05:40.370 --> 05:43.038
I spilled some pesto.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.541
When did you have pesto?
I dribbled in my pants.

05:46.543 --> 05:48.510
I peed my pants a bit.
A small bit, it's just a

05:48.512 --> 05:50.345
dribble.
That looks like a double

05:50.347 --> 05:52.714
dribble, at least a walk.
Flagrant foul.

05:52.716 --> 05:55.183
I was out of pee bibs, and I
was trying to check my lineup

05:55.185 --> 05:57.085
and e at the same time.
Classic tinker tinkle.

05:57.087 --> 05:58.787
Oh, what is...?

05:58.789 --> 06:01.590
What is this?
Heavy Pet...

06:01.592 --> 06:06.261
Ha-ha.
God, what are you doing?

06:06.263 --> 06:08.930
Gentlemen, the puppy party
has arrived.

06:08.932 --> 06:11.133
You're driving around in a
van that says "Heavy Petting"?

06:11.135 --> 06:13.535
Yeah.
You got to use a pun name in the

06:13.537 --> 06:15.337
pet industry.
It's like a rule.

06:15.339 --> 06:18.540
I was thinking about "Pup Pup
and Away" or "Pup Tents," but

06:18.542 --> 06:21.810
market research pointed to this.
What market research, Taco?

06:21.812 --> 06:24.980
Just me thinking about stuff.
That's not even a pun, Taco.

06:24.982 --> 06:27.415
It's just a sex act.
Ugh, get your minds out of

06:27.417 --> 06:30.218
the gutter, please.
Kids!

06:30.220 --> 06:33.922
Who's up for some heavy petting?
Yay!

06:35.859 --> 06:42.564
Well, hi, doggie doggie.
Oh, you're so...

06:42.566 --> 06:45.567
Oh, he's smiling.
That means he likes you.

06:45.569 --> 06:49.171
Oh, no, no.
Ew!

06:49.173 --> 06:51.306
Yeah, yeah, bite the neck,
that's good.

06:51.308 --> 06:54.509
Just like I taught you.
Jesus, Taco, half these dogs

06:54.511 --> 06:56.444
can't walk.
Yeah, which means they're

06:56.446 --> 06:58.480
great for petting.
They're not puppies, Taco,

06:58.482 --> 07:00.415
they're just old dogs.
I don't know how old they

07:00.417 --> 07:02.317
are, but I guarantee they're
puppies.

07:02.319 --> 07:04.252
You know "puppy" is not a
breed?

07:04.254 --> 07:07.355
No, it's an ethnicity, like
"Canadian" or "vampire."

07:07.357 --> 07:09.758
This guy's a purebred puppy.
Purebred.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.493
This guy's a mutt.
Half-puppy, half-poodle, I

07:11.495 --> 07:13.428
think.
What you basically have here

07:13.430 --> 07:15.864
is a mobile pet cemetery, and I
think that one might be a cat.

07:15.866 --> 07:17.632
Oh, do you think people will

07:17.634 --> 07:20.001
notice?
Hey, your dog bit my kid.

07:20.003 --> 07:22.103
No, no, he probably just gave
him a little "teeth hug."

07:22.105 --> 07:23.805
Come on, Carson, we're
getting out of here.

07:23.807 --> 07:25.707
What?
If it makes you feel any

07:25.709 --> 07:27.709
better, that kid's a total bed
wetter.

07:27.711 --> 07:29.811
What did I tell you, puppies?

07:29.813 --> 07:31.513
No biting.
Bad puppies.

07:31.515 --> 07:33.181
Whoa, hey, stop.

07:33.183 --> 07:35.150
Taco.
Taco, you don't need to do

07:35.152 --> 07:37.118
all of 'em.
It's not Bow-schwitz.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.788
They appreciate that I treat
'em all equally.

07:39.790 --> 07:43.458
Rodney!
Excuse me, it's my nightmare

07:43.460 --> 07:46.061
neighbor.
Oh, I love the dog wiener.

07:46.063 --> 07:48.230
Oh, it's-it's "wiener dog,"
sweetheart.

07:48.232 --> 07:53.001
No, it's a "puppy wiener."
Smile.

07:53.003 --> 07:55.370
That'll be $40, please.
Everybody calls me Ruxin.

07:55.372 --> 07:57.038
Well, I don't.
What do you want?

07:57.040 --> 07:58.807
Your dogs have been peeing on
my lawn.

07:58.809 --> 08:00.475
Not my problem, lady.

08:00.477 --> 08:02.143
Would you stop growling?
Bad dog.

08:04.915 --> 08:07.148
Uh-oh.
I don't have any dogs.

08:07.150 --> 08:09.217
Look!
Those are puppies.

08:09.219 --> 08:11.519
They pee.
Stay with me, Zeke.

08:11.521 --> 08:15.090
Do not go towards the light.
You stay.

08:15.092 --> 08:17.759
Okay.
Clear!

08:17.761 --> 08:20.262
You're such a liar!
That's why your wife left you.

08:20.264 --> 08:22.364
She didn't leave me, she's on
vacation.

08:22.366 --> 08:24.032
Oh, right.
Okay, mouth to mouth.

08:24.034 --> 08:25.700
No, stop, Taco.
Taco, oh, God.

08:25.702 --> 08:27.369
Taco, that's enough.
Oh, where has that tongue

08:27.371 --> 08:29.271
been?
These guys are gonna need so

08:29.273 --> 08:31.039
much therapy.
Well, you know, if I find

08:31.041 --> 08:32.874
another pee spot, I'm gonna slap
the dickens out of you!

08:32.876 --> 08:34.909
Really?
All right, kids, grab a

08:34.910 --> 08:36.910
shovel, we're gonna play "puppy
funeral."

08:36.913 --> 08:39.414
Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop the clock, stop the clock.

08:39.416 --> 08:41.582
Your party's over.
We're not burying dogs with

08:41.585 --> 08:43.551
these children around.
Well, is there a ditch we

08:43.553 --> 08:45.420
could chuck it into?
Put him in the van.

08:45.422 --> 08:47.455
No, there's already two dogs
in there.

08:47.457 --> 08:50.292
Oh.
Mom, Dad, look at this

08:50.294 --> 08:52.360
picture of me and Zoey.
Isn't she so cute?

08:52.362 --> 08:54.562
Mm-hmm.
The elderly puppy is super cute,

08:54.564 --> 08:56.298
but it is dinnertime now, babe,
please eat.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.199
This is not dinner.
I don't know why we're calling

08:58.201 --> 09:00.035
it that.
What?

09:00.037 --> 09:01.870
What i-- what is this?
This is broccolini, tofu, and

09:01.872 --> 09:04.072
kale?
I ca-- I can't do this, I need

09:04.074 --> 09:05.907
protein.
You know what?

09:05.909 --> 09:07.575
I did forget one thing.
I'll be back.

09:07.577 --> 09:09.778
Is it dessert?
No, it's the vitamins.

09:09.780 --> 09:14.049
Oh, not those green pills.
They taste like compost.

09:14.051 --> 09:16.484
Um, babe, I got to use the
bathroom.

09:16.486 --> 09:18.386
Okay.
Hey, hey, come

09:18.388 --> 09:20.255
on, let's go, follow me.
What?

09:20.257 --> 09:21.923
Shh, just shh.
Me, too.

09:21.925 --> 09:23.758
Okay.
What are we doing?

09:23.760 --> 09:27.495
Shh.
Okay, go, go, go, go.

09:27.497 --> 09:31.433
All right.
Listen, this is the quiet cave.

09:31.435 --> 09:36.104
And you can never tell Mommy
what you sawn here, okay?

09:36.106 --> 09:39.841
What's that?
Feast your eyes... on this.

09:39.843 --> 09:43.645
Oh, Dad, it's gross.
No, no, no, no, it's covered

09:43.647 --> 09:47.082
in plastic bags, and the water
in here is perfectly clean, and

09:47.084 --> 09:49.150
Mommy will never think to look
inside here.

09:49.152 --> 09:51.152
Ha-ha.
Ah.

09:51.154 --> 09:55.156
So, milady, I ask you, care
to join me for a dinner party?

09:55.158 --> 09:58.093
Why, I would love to join you
for a dinner party.

09:58.095 --> 10:04.632
I'll set the table.
Uh-uh-uh, pinkies up when we eat

10:04.634 --> 10:08.870
our licorice.
Cheers.

10:08.872 --> 10:11.473
Oh, it seems you spilled a
little bit in the corner of your

10:11.475 --> 10:13.808
mouth.
May I get that for you?

10:13.810 --> 10:16.811
Oh, lovely.

10:16.813 --> 10:23.985
Rodney!

10:23.987 --> 10:27.055
Everybody calls me Ruxin.
Rodney?

10:27.057 --> 10:30.392
Yes, Mrs. Hatch?
I told you before that I want

10:30.394 --> 10:33.395
to keep your dogs off of my
lawn.

10:33.397 --> 10:35.563
As I told you before, I don't
have any dogs.

10:35.565 --> 10:37.532
So, I'm supposed to believe
that you're the one peeing on

10:37.534 --> 10:39.100
the lawn?
Yeah, yeah, I'm peeing all

10:39.102 --> 10:40.702
over your lawn.
That's wh...

10:40.704 --> 10:42.704
Ow!
Oh, God!

10:42.706 --> 10:45.173
Ow!
And I'm taking this bracelet,

10:45.175 --> 10:47.475
too.
That's not a bracelet, it's

10:47.477 --> 10:48.977
a...
Oh, no, it's mine.

10:48.979 --> 10:50.478
It was on my property.
Thank you.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.213
You know what, go ahead.
Keep it.

10:52.215 --> 10:57.585
And keep the curtains of mine
that you're wearing as a dress.

10:57.587 --> 11:00.488
Yes.
Hey, Pete, do you think maybe

11:00.490 --> 11:03.258
later todawe can talk about
that trade?

11:03.260 --> 11:05.927
You know, my head's just so
full right now.

11:05.929 --> 11:08.163
I think maybe just finish off my
eight-hour online traffic school

11:08.165 --> 11:09.998
and then we can talk about it,
okay?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.232
Almost done.
Great.

11:11.234 --> 11:12.567
You got it.
Thanks.

11:12.569 --> 11:14.502
Why is Andre building you an
end table?

11:14.504 --> 11:16.337
Well, the rest of my bedroom
set's already done.

11:16.339 --> 11:20.275
This is the last piece.
You made him your trade maid.

11:20.277 --> 11:21.943
Trade maid.
You sly little devil.

11:21.945 --> 11:23.445
Mmm.
Guys, do you believe this?

11:23.447 --> 11:25.246
You got to park 12 inches away
from the curb when you parallel

11:25.248 --> 11:27.348
park.
Crazy.

11:27.350 --> 11:28.683
Crazy.
Yeah, right?

11:28.685 --> 11:30.084
I got the snacks, huh?
Yes!

11:30.086 --> 11:31.853
Let's get rid of this healthy
crap, let's go.

11:31.855 --> 11:34.923
Oh, yeah.
Why are these all wet?

11:34.925 --> 11:36.591
'Cause I keep them in the
back of the toilet.

11:36.593 --> 11:37.926
Oh!
What?

11:37.928 --> 11:40.261
What... Why?
What?

11:40.263 --> 11:41.796
I have to.
Jenny can't find out where I

11:41.798 --> 11:43.765
keep it.
Huh? Licorice?

11:43.767 --> 11:45.300
No, no, thanks.
I'll skip the crappetizers.

11:45.302 --> 11:47.135
Yeah, no toilunch for me.
Andre?

11:47.137 --> 11:49.037
Yeah?
Huh?

11:49.039 --> 11:50.872
Oh, I love the gummies.
Yeah.

11:50.874 --> 11:53.775
Why is this all wet?
Uh, freezer burn.

11:53.777 --> 11:55.944
Oh. I love it.
Keep me cool.

11:55.946 --> 11:57.445
Yeah, I know you do.
Gummies for dummies.

11:57.447 --> 12:00.114
Yeah!
What the...?

12:00.116 --> 12:03.818
Is that my scarf?
Aw, come on.

12:03.820 --> 12:06.120
Um, your scarf?
Get up, come on.

12:06.122 --> 12:07.989
What are you doing?
That is... No...

12:07.991 --> 12:10.792
That is my, that is, that is
my scarf, okay?

12:10.794 --> 12:12.393
Now, that is...

12:12.395 --> 12:14.462
This is my scarf, not a toy.
All right.

12:14.464 --> 12:16.631
Go fetch, girl!

12:16.633 --> 12:18.733
That is my hat.
Dude, I was doing you a

12:18.735 --> 12:20.335
favor.
You are a brat, you know

12:20.337 --> 12:22.003
that?
An inconsiderate brat.

12:22.005 --> 12:24.906
Whoa, wait, watch it, Andre.
Hey, Andre, did I just walk

12:24.908 --> 12:27.141
into my house and hear you yell
at my kid?

12:27.143 --> 12:29.444
Yeah, 'cause she's being a
jackass.

12:29.446 --> 12:31.012
Hey.
Yeah, well, she's <i>our</i>

12:31.014 --> 12:32.480
<i>jackass.</i>
<i>We made her that way.</i>

12:32.482 --> 12:34.449
<i>Your daughter needs to be</i>
<i>punished, and that dog needs to</i>

12:34.451 --> 12:37.085
<i>be put down.</i>
<i>Why don't we just wait a week</i>

12:37.087 --> 12:38.953
<i>on the dog?</i>
<i>Yeah, where'd that puppy go?</i>

12:38.955 --> 12:41.256
<i>The wiener ran away.</i>
<i>It's ironic, 'cause usually</i>

12:41.258 --> 12:43.157
<i>wiener make a beeline for</i>
<i>Andre's buns.</i>

12:43.159 --> 12:45.193
<i>Fives.</i>
<i>Fives.</i>

12:45.195 --> 12:47.462
<i>Andre, you're a bad person.</i>
<i>You scared the puppy away.</i>

12:47.464 --> 12:49.764
<i>Look, I am so sorry.</i>
<i>No!</i>

12:49.766 --> 12:51.466
<i>Zoey?</i>
<i>Zoey!</i>

12:51.468 --> 12:53.301
<i>Way to go, Andre.</i>

12:53.303 --> 12:55.136
<i>She's the one who's throwing</i>
<i>my hat.</i>

12:55.138 --> 12:57.138
<i>I lost so many puppies this</i>

12:57.140 --> 12:59.641
<i>week.</i>
<i>Mostly to death or something</i>

12:59.643 --> 13:02.810
<i>called osteoporosis.</i>

13:08.857 --> 13:12.000
Hey, I think I've seen her
jumping rope in the

13:12.240 --> 13:13.907
neighborhood.
Oh, that makes sense.

13:13.909 --> 13:16.843
She does a lot of tricks.
What's "semi-trained"?

13:16.845 --> 13:18.712
It means she's good with
number one, but she'll number

13:18.714 --> 13:20.513
two just about anywhere.
Just plops them all over the

13:20.515 --> 13:23.016
place.
How old is she?

13:23.018 --> 13:24.851
Nine, I guess.
But she looks a lot older.

13:24.853 --> 13:27.220
Uh, it gets her into trouble
quite a bit, as you can imagine.

13:27.222 --> 13:29.489
Oh.
Oh, God, I hope she doesn't

13:29.491 --> 13:31.858
come back pregnant.
Look, if you see her, can you

13:31.860 --> 13:34.327
just grab her?
Like, she's gonna kick and

13:34.329 --> 13:36.429
scream a lot, but just throw her
in a dark room, she'll calm

13:36.431 --> 13:38.698
down, and then you give me a
call and I'll come pick her up.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.700
You are sick.
You need medication.

13:40.702 --> 13:43.770
Well, I got news for you,
sister, I'm already on a lot of

13:43.772 --> 13:48.441
medication.

13:48.443 --> 13:52.579
Geoffrey, no!
Stop, Baby Geoffrey, stop.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.247
I can't stop!
I know it's tough when you

13:54.249 --> 13:56.950
get the pee train in motion,
buddy, but you got to stop.

13:56.952 --> 14:00.086
Geoffrey, who taught you to do
that?

14:00.088 --> 14:02.522
Uncle Rafi. He told me it
was bad to hold it in.

14:02.524 --> 14:04.924
Yeah, but you can't pee on
people's lawns.

14:04.926 --> 14:07.260
Especially Nanny Pacquiao's,
okay?

14:07.262 --> 14:10.630
'Cause when you pee on green
grass, it turns it yellow.

14:10.632 --> 14:16.036
That's it!
Oh.

14:16.038 --> 14:18.438
I think it's good.
I really thought we were

14:18.440 --> 14:20.874
going to lunch.
This is lunch.

14:20.876 --> 14:23.243
This is... this is salad
shake.

14:23.245 --> 14:25.645
I want food, real food that
people consume.

14:25.647 --> 14:28.048
Are you sure?
Yes.

14:28.050 --> 14:31.718
Ew, what is that?
That's you.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.055
How many pounds does it take to
change a lightbulb?

14:35.057 --> 14:37.457
Oh, God.
Drink up.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.959
Oy.
Oh, it tastes like the back

14:39.961 --> 14:43.930
of a lawn mower.
Hey, buddy.

14:43.932 --> 14:46.299
Hey.
You know him?

14:46.301 --> 14:48.668
No. He was just staring at
us, though.

14:48.670 --> 14:51.071
Maybe because you were
screaming about how horrible the

14:51.073 --> 14:53.473
drinks are here.
Everyone here knows it's

14:53.475 --> 14:55.909
horrible. They just...
They're buying into it.

14:55.911 --> 14:58.278
That's how people...
No.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.680
Oh, God.
No.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.083
No!
No, no, that's not...

15:03.085 --> 15:05.485
Oh, my God.
She's <i>our</i> daughter.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.687
Sweetheart, tell everyone
that we are your parents.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.923
Yeah.
My real pents wouldn't make

15:09.925 --> 15:12.092
me eat crap like this.
What? No.

15:12.094 --> 15:14.094
No, no, no, you can eat
whatever you want-- ice cream.

15:14.096 --> 15:16.496
Twinkies.
Ho Hos.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.932
Gummy bears.
Skittles.

15:18.934 --> 15:21.101
Whipped cream right in your
mouth. What do you want?

15:21.103 --> 15:23.103
I want some of the sausage
Daddy showed me in the bathroom.

15:23.105 --> 15:25.305
No! No, no.
Right, that's a <i>secret.</i>

15:25.307 --> 15:27.307
<i>No. Secret? Secrets.</i>
<i>All right, got to...</i>

15:27.309 --> 15:29.309
<i>No. L's go, come on.</i>
<i>We got to go, we got to go.</i>

15:29.311 --> 15:31.711
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey.</i>
<i>Hey! Ow!</i>

15:31.713 --> 15:33.947
<i>Hey, Daddy's little girl.</i>
<i>Ha, ha.</i>

15:33.949 --> 15:36.316
<i>Ow! You're hurting me!</i>

15:36.318 --> 15:38.718
<i>Okay, that's most of the bedroom</i>
<i>set.</i>

15:38.720 --> 15:41.121
<i>Great, can you return it to</i>
<i>the store, now, please?</i>

15:41.123 --> 15:43.523
<i>Are you playing Minesweeper?</i>
<i>I told you how swamped I am,</i>

15:43.525 --> 15:45.959
<i>Andre.</i>
<i>I need the stress relief.</i>

15:45.961 --> 15:48.328
<i>This trade's never gonna</i>
<i>happen, is it?</i>

15:48.330 --> 15:50.530
<i>Andre, this is the last favor</i>
<i>I need from you, okay?</i>

15:50.532 --> 15:53.900
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:53.902 --> 15:57.470
<i>Little help?</i>
<i>Ooh, cleared the board.</i>

15:57.472 --> 16:01.341
<i>Can no one change toilet</i>

16:01.343 --> 16:03.743
<i>paper in this house?</i>
<i>Just...</i>

16:03.745 --> 16:06.146
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>He hit all</i> of the toilet paper,

16:06.148 --> 16:08.515
not one, just...
Hey, Jenny.

16:08.517 --> 16:10.917
Hi. What the...?

16:10.919 --> 16:13.319
Whoa!
Why is there food in my toilet?

16:13.321 --> 16:15.688
Just the cheese is mine.
The rest of that junk is

16:15.690 --> 16:18.158
Kevin's.
What?!

16:18.160 --> 16:20.527
Brothers.
Always cramping your space.

16:20.529 --> 16:21.728
See you later.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.164
Kevin!
Hey, was Taco just...?

16:24.166 --> 16:27.767
Oh, no.
You've been eating secret

16:27.769 --> 16:30.170
meals on the toilet?
Not secret meals.

16:30.172 --> 16:32.572
They're-they're crappetizers.
Oh, God.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.008
Hey, um...
Oh, another elegant MacArthur

16:35.010 --> 16:37.377
family meal.
Do you guys have any of those

16:37.379 --> 16:39.779
vitamins that make your pee
green?

16:39.781 --> 16:42.182
Yes. Please, take them.
Thank you.

16:42.184 --> 16:45.718
Bon appétit, Wolfgang Schmucks.
You're starving me out, here,

16:45.720 --> 16:48.121
babe.
I'll make you a smoothie.

16:48.123 --> 16:50.456
I don't want a smoothie.
I want salty, fat meat in my

16:50.458 --> 16:52.892
mouth.
Pete's donger's available.

16:52.894 --> 16:56.529
You had to see that one coming.

16:56.531 --> 17:00.900
Is the dog gonna be okay?
Yeah, he'll be fine.

17:00.902 --> 17:04.037
Took one of his wheels off so no
one would steal him.

17:04.039 --> 17:06.406
Ah. Smart thinking.
Yeah. Eat up.

17:06.407 --> 17:08.808
You know what you're going home
to.

17:08.810 --> 17:11.211
Oh, at least I got my dad's
toilet food.

17:11.213 --> 17:13.613
Your dad's a smart man.
Toilet tank's the best place to

17:13.615 --> 17:16.049
keep food.
I got fruits and vegetables at

17:16.050 --> 17:18.218
Ruxin's toilet.
I got, uh, cheese and meats at

17:18.220 --> 17:20.420
Kevin's toilet.
Also have some hard-boiled eggs

17:20.422 --> 17:23.556
and mayonnaise at a toilet down
at the, uh, Sears Tower in case

17:23.558 --> 17:25.758
I'm downtown and want some egg
salad.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.161
Whew!
That was a lot of food.

17:28.163 --> 17:30.496
Real food.
Yeah.

17:30.498 --> 17:32.932
Thanks for paying.
I'll get the next one.

17:32.934 --> 17:35.301
Hey, can I have a ride home?
Sorry, kid.

17:35.303 --> 17:38.071
No can do.
Headed downtown to find some new

17:38.073 --> 17:40.607
puppies.
But... I don't know how to

17:40.609 --> 17:43.009
get home.
Right.

17:43.011 --> 17:45.411
I'm being irresponsible.
Here.

17:45.413 --> 17:49.849
It's a compass.
"N" is this way, and I think

17:49.851 --> 17:52.852
you live somewhere this way...
ish.

17:52.854 --> 17:57.023
Hyah! Hyah! Let's go, boy.
Let's go.

17:57.025 --> 18:07.767
Oh, my God, this is working.

18:07.769 --> 18:09.969
Rodney!
Everybody calls me uxin."

18:09.971 --> 18:11.971
I knew it was you who was
peeing on my lawn.

18:11.973 --> 18:13.973
I'm <i>fixing</i> your lawn.
Put that little cocktail

18:13.975 --> 18:16.309
weenie away.
I can't. Once the pee train's

18:16.311 --> 18:18.344
left the station, there's no
turning back.

18:18.346 --> 18:20.546
Well, I'll put it away for
you, here.

18:20.548 --> 18:22.548
No!
Come here with that little

18:22.550 --> 18:24.784
cocktail weenie, you...
No!

18:24.786 --> 18:26.786
Come here. Come here! I'll
get that from you. Oh, get...

18:26.788 --> 18:29.188
No, Mrs. Hatch.
I'll get that from you.

18:29.190 --> 18:31.357
Always whining, always whining.

18:31.359 --> 18:33.559
Hey, you keep whining, you're

18:33.561 --> 18:35.695
gonna get zapped again.
Don't think I'm not gonna get

18:35.697 --> 18:36.710
you, little Rodney.
No, stop it!

18:36.830 --> 18:38.048
Give it to me.
Fine, you leave me no choice.

18:42.003 --> 18:44.203
What the...?
Come on, what the hell's wrong

18:44.205 --> 18:46.572
with this thing?
Hey, bad dog.

18:46.574 --> 18:48.234
Whoa. What happened here, huh?

18:48.354 --> 18:49.275
What's going on, Ruxin?

18:49.379 --> 18:52.223
Not much. You know what.
I think the dog's still

18:52.343 --> 18:54.512
growling.
What did I tell you?

18:54.632 --> 18:55.950
Bad boy!

18:57.376 --> 18:58.676
Hey, Sofia.

19:03.531 --> 19:06.536
Hey, is that Ellie?

19:07.412 --> 19:09.779
Hey, hey, little girl.
What's up?

19:09.781 --> 19:10.950
Come on.
No.

19:11.070 --> 19:12.746
Want a ride?
No!

19:13.055 --> 19:14.493
What are you doing so far
away from home?

19:14.630 --> 19:16.830
Taco left me.
Oh, well, come on, get in the

19:16.832 --> 19:17.827
van, we'll have some fun.
Look...

19:17.947 --> 19:19.635
No. I don't want to get in
the van.

19:19.871 --> 19:21.804
I'm so sorry about the things
that happened between us, but,

19:21.806 --> 19:23.806
look, I can't have you walk home
by yourself. I...

19:23.808 --> 19:26.539
Get in the van.
I got... I got, uh... candy.

19:27.831 --> 19:29.831
I don't want candy from you.
Five-four-five to Central.

19:29.833 --> 19:33.715
I got eyes on a potential perp.
Vehicle says "Heavy Petting."

19:33.835 --> 19:35.835
Ellie, I can't have you walk
home by yourself.

19:35.837 --> 19:36.921
Your parents would kill me.
Uh-uh.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.369
Okay, you know what?
That's it.

19:38.483 --> 19:40.483
You're getting in the van.
Come with me.

19:40.485 --> 19:41.616
No.
Come on, come on!

19:41.742 --> 19:43.742
No, stop it!
Come on, get in the van.

19:43.744 --> 19:45.678
Don't put me in the van!
I don't want to get in the van!

19:45.680 --> 19:46.996
Just get in the van.
I'm moving in. I'm moving in.

19:47.237 --> 19:49.203
Get in the van and be quiet.
I don't want to get in your van.

19:49.205 --> 19:51.406
No!
Get in that van. There.

19:51.408 --> 19:53.474
There! Stay in there, okay?
We're gonna play games, we're

19:53.476 --> 19:55.476
gonna have fun.
I don't want to play games in

19:55.478 --> 19:56.299
your van.
It's a secret between

19:56.419 --> 19:57.525
me and you, that's it.
No one has to know.

19:57.645 --> 19:59.854
You sick bastard!

20:04.420 --> 20:07.316
Hey, Pete, it's Andre.
Trade go through?

20:07.436 --> 20:09.870
The trade did go through.
With Ted.

20:09.872 --> 20:11.833
What?
But I did all those chores and

20:11.953 --> 20:12.997
favors.
I helped clear your head.

20:13.113 --> 20:15.313
I don't make trades with
alleged sex offenders.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.275
And you did clear my head.
I really appreciate it.

20:17.285 --> 20:19.951
And once my head was clear, I
realized that was a terrible trade.

20:19.953 --> 20:22.120
Well, can you at least bail
me out of jail?

20:22.122 --> 20:23.802
Pete, they're
monsters in here.

20:23.868 --> 20:25.598
They used part of my scarf as
toilet paper.

20:25.718 --> 20:28.758
You know what. I'm totally underwater right now.
I'm slogging through e-mails.

20:28.806 --> 20:31.006
Maybe later this afternoon,
okay?

20:31.008 --> 20:33.441
Hello? Hello?

20:34.633 --> 20:37.241
You realize you're literally
doing what a dog does right now?

20:37.361 --> 20:40.526
Yeah. Jenny will <i>never</i> look in here.
Ooh, Ding Dongs.

20:40.646 --> 20:42.095
Hey! Get your own pot.

20:42.663 --> 20:53.056
