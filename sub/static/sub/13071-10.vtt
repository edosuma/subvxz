WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
* Previously on BrainDead... *

00:14.215 --> 00:16.217
This is what a baby seal
looks like.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.711
* Yeah

00:45.446 --> 00:48.816
* Baby, I want to turn
your swing state *

00:48.849 --> 00:50.251
* All blue

00:50.284 --> 00:51.285
(gagging)

00:53.821 --> 00:55.756
* Oh, yeah

00:55.789 --> 00:58.326
* Treat me like
Flint, Michigan *

01:18.846 --> 01:20.681
The matter under discussion

01:20.714 --> 01:24.285
involves a-an appendix "Q"
scenario,

01:24.318 --> 01:28.422
and that means a time-sensitive,
ticking bomb

01:28.456 --> 01:30.158
terrorist attack.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.326
NARRATOR:
Are we here again?

01:32.360 --> 01:36.397
False evidence leading us
to an unnecessary war?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.699
Leaving a country in chaos?

01:40.368 --> 01:42.470
And who benefits?

01:43.737 --> 01:46.174
The one percent.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.475
Who wants this war?

01:47.508 --> 01:48.376
Wall Street.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.777
LUKE:
How is it?

01:49.810 --> 01:52.380
Luke, give me a few thousand
dollars and a camera,

01:52.413 --> 01:54.148
and I can do better than this.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.683
No. It's coming
from PAC money.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.151
We can't coordinate.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.519
But I can offer criticism?

01:58.552 --> 02:01.422
Well, there's coordinate
and then there's coordinate.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.423
So?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.857
Well, it starts out well,

02:03.891 --> 02:05.459
but it's obsessed
with the one percent.

02:05.493 --> 02:06.760
I mean, I don't think
these war hearings

02:06.794 --> 02:08.529
are really about
financial inequality.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.298
Are they?
No.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.565
So, talk to him.

02:11.599 --> 02:12.900
Give him those notes.
Who?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.402
The filmmaker;
he's coming in today.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.536
Me? Why me?

02:15.569 --> 02:17.471
It sounds better
coming from you.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.407
It's kind of a "start over" job.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.608
Well, that's all right.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.577
Right now, we can out-vote
the war committee extremists,

02:23.611 --> 02:26.580
but it's a razor-thin majority,
and public opinion matters.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.282
A short, punchy documentary

02:28.316 --> 02:30.551
can do wonders, especially
if it goes viral.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.586
Okay.
I'll get my notes together.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.255
Good.

02:34.288 --> 02:37.258
NARRATOR:
The one percent wants the war.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.960
The rest of us suffer.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.430
Congratulations.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.532
What an amazing job you've done.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.899
Thank you, Senator.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.568
It's been you
on the barricades,

02:47.601 --> 02:49.637
fighting back the hordes, huh?

02:49.670 --> 02:50.904
Pistols blazing.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.206
There's only one way, Senator.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.307
Yes, there is.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.542
The One Wayers.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.444
Now, Jane...
Jules.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.479
We're in the fight
of our lives.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.948
That's why we idealists
have to stick together.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.716
We're outnumbered.
Yes, Senator.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.352
Good.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.587
I'm glad you understand,
because...

03:06.620 --> 03:08.422
I want you to hold your breath

03:08.456 --> 03:09.657
for the next few minutes.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.658
Mm-mm.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.560
Not-not literally.

03:12.593 --> 03:16.297
Keep your powder dry when
I introduce these people to you.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.466
Who are they?

03:19.467 --> 03:20.901
Are you here to see the senator?

03:20.934 --> 03:23.704
I'm here
to make a statement.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.306
I'm angry.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.640
Okay.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.476
Hey, here we all are.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.244
Thanks for your patience.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.546
Ella, hello, and
your friend.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.847
Why don't you
come on in.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.517
Senator, would you
like me to sit in?

03:36.550 --> 03:39.620
No, buddy. I think this one
I can take alone.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.723
I'll knock if I need you.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.695
(shouting over each other)

03:47.728 --> 03:49.497
Okay, let's all
just calm down.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.866
Yes, now that that is out
of your system, let's talk.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.935
Noah, you represent
the No Wayers.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.571
And, Jane, you represent
the One Wayers;

03:57.605 --> 03:59.307
there's nothing
you agree on.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.875
Ella and I agree
on almost nothing.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.344
Isn't that right?

04:03.377 --> 04:04.712
It is. You are the devil.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.813
And she's a bitch,

04:05.846 --> 04:07.715
but our methods
are similar.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.982
We're idealists.

04:09.016 --> 04:12.820
We want 100%
of what we want.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.388
We don't want
to compromise.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.323
Right.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.692
My debate is not with Red,
at least not now.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.495
My debate
is with Democrats

04:21.529 --> 04:25.333
who want less, who
betray our ideals.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.401
Noah, when you first came to me,
what did you say?

04:27.435 --> 04:28.636
I'm angry.
Mm-hmm.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.038
And what did
you tell me?

04:31.071 --> 04:32.039
I'm angry.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.875
See? Look at you two.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.545
You're two peas
in a pod.
(Ella chuckles)

04:37.578 --> 04:40.047
What did you want?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.982
What was your goal
when you came to me?

04:42.015 --> 04:43.517
JULES:
To stop the other...

04:43.551 --> 04:45.519
No, no, no, no,
no, no. Remember?

04:45.553 --> 04:47.588
What did you say
about the government?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.723
Oh.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.825
That we need
to burn it down.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.362
It's rigged.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.696
That's what I said.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.631
ELLA:
You see?

04:57.665 --> 04:59.600
She is not the enemy.

04:59.633 --> 05:03.771
The enemy...
is out there.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.541
(low growling)

05:10.143 --> 05:11.679
Now, let's be clear here.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.915
This vote... this vote
to put boots on the ground

05:14.948 --> 05:16.817
in Syria is not welcomed
by the president.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.520
It's not even welcomed
by our allies.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.355
It is being driven by
ideological extremists...

05:21.389 --> 05:22.756
Am I an ideological extremist,
Senator?

05:22.790 --> 05:24.124
LUKE: You'll have
your 15 minutes, Senator...

05:24.157 --> 05:27.795
Me, a man who-who had
two people on his staff killed

05:27.828 --> 05:29.630
by-by Syrian terrorists...
DIANE: Senator Wheatus, please!

05:29.663 --> 05:31.465
LUKE: We don't know
who killed them

05:31.499 --> 05:33.767
or even if anyone killed them...
RED: We sure as hell do.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.769
Senators, I have
in front of me

05:35.803 --> 05:39.106
over 50,000 signatures
from patriotic...

05:39.139 --> 05:42.009
(quietly):
How are you?
Good.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.011
Stop betraying America!
Vote for the war!
(crowd clamoring)

05:44.044 --> 05:47.715
Stop human rights
abuses in Syria!

05:47.748 --> 05:50.718
Vote for the war!
Vote for the war now!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.554
Why-why are we silencing
the American public?
All right, you guys, out. Out.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.023
They are under
unprecedented attack.
Senator,

05:56.056 --> 05:59.493
you and these protesters are,
respectfully, on the wrong side

05:59.527 --> 06:00.628
of basic common sense.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.630
RED: Let me understand.
Your solution...

06:02.663 --> 06:05.633
Do you know him?

06:05.666 --> 06:06.800
No.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.602
He nodded at you.

06:10.638 --> 06:13.507
He was just in our office today,
with Senator Pollack.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.810
LAUREL: I don't know his name--
Noah something--

06:16.844 --> 06:18.879
but he's the constituent in here
who threatened me.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.582
I thought you said he was
some lefty extremist.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.918
I know. But Gareth said
he was in his office with Ella.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.424
Okay, look, we're still up
on the war committee votes.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.959
We should be fine.
Are you sure?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.727
I'm not sure of
anything anymore.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.996
Hey, the documentary guy
is in the conference room.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.998
Give him your notes.
We may need it.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.812
Luke, that's Ben Valderrama.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.847
The filmmaker. Yeah. Why?

06:53.881 --> 06:54.915
I know him.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.617
So?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.619
He's become... famous.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.153
Good. Give him your notes.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.822
No, I-I think
you should.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.056
Laurel, give him your notes.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.725
You represent me.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.735
Laurie.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.737
Ben, hi.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.907
You look amazing.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.109
Congrats on-on all your stuff.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.644
I mean,
your-your documentaries...

07:23.677 --> 07:25.212
Thanks.
You-you saw them?

07:25.245 --> 07:27.881
The one on fracking--
very powerful.

07:27.915 --> 07:28.882
Really?

07:28.916 --> 07:30.618
I still hate that last shot.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.620
It's kind of corny.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.755
And you, you're, uh... you've...

07:34.788 --> 07:36.557
You're working here.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.893
Yeah. Yeah, it's good.
It's, uh...

07:39.927 --> 07:42.563
Yeah, and-and your work, you
were doing something on music?

07:42.596 --> 07:44.565
Um, Melanesian choirs.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.900
It's still in the works.
I-I'm just gathering the money.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.737
Well, I'd love to see
whatever you have.

07:49.770 --> 07:53.807
Remember how we wanted
to just... change everything?

07:53.841 --> 07:54.908
Yeah.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.110
Not just the world
but reality,

07:57.144 --> 07:59.079
how people saw reality.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.948
Yeah. Yeah, we were young.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.017
Yeah. We were.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.654
So let's talk about
saving this country first.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.021
Uh, they said you had notes.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.023
Yeah, just a few, just...
Good, good.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.125
I'm open to anything.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.026
It's good.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.696
It's very good.
I'm used to these notes.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.130
"It's good, but..."

08:17.164 --> 08:19.833
So give me the "but."
It's not a big "but."

08:19.867 --> 08:22.235
It's, um... it's just the stuff
about the one percent.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.737
Yeah, it's awful, right?

08:23.771 --> 08:26.073
How Wall Street's
destroying this country,

08:26.106 --> 08:28.776
how no one from the recession
went to jail.

08:28.809 --> 08:32.179
Yes. But I think this should
focus more on the war.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.615
But the money is the war.
That's the real problem.
I know. I just think

08:34.648 --> 08:36.950
Luke wants something more
focused on this vote coming up.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.251
I'm being defensive,
aren't I?
No, no.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.020
Yeah, yeah.
It's one of my weaknesses.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.624
So tell me. I'm here to learn.
What should I do?

08:43.657 --> 08:45.859
What's this, uh, war talk about?
(indistinct arguing)

08:45.893 --> 08:48.261
NOAH: I am a normal voter,
just a normal voter.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.830
You're agreeing
with the Republicans...

08:49.863 --> 08:52.332
Just give me one minute, Ben.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.868
NOAH: It's a human rights issue!
LUKE: You are being used, sir.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.870
How dare you accuse me
of being a warmonger?

08:56.904 --> 08:58.238
The cynical Republicans are
using your passion to change...

08:58.271 --> 08:59.773
Here we go.
If you can't win an argument,

08:59.807 --> 09:01.609
just shut it down
and drag me out.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.911
Well, I got news for you:
I'm talking to other senators!

09:03.944 --> 09:07.347
You have lost votes, sir!
You lost votes, sir!

09:07.380 --> 09:09.349
I'm going up and
down these halls!

09:09.382 --> 09:13.253
Extremists.
I'd look at extremists.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.088
LUKE: No, I just had one of
these crazy people in here.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.990
He's talking about going
to all the Democratic senators

09:17.024 --> 09:18.792
to pressure them
into voting for war.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.628
Yes, I just had one in here.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.630
A Republican.
It's Red astroturfing.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.964
He's got these groups
working for him.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.032
We've got to check on the votes,

09:25.065 --> 09:28.068
make sure we're still up.
I know.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.004
Senator?
Yes?

09:31.038 --> 09:33.106
Are we still on the same page?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.708
Look, I'm up for reelection,

09:34.742 --> 09:36.644
just like you are.
Oh, come on!

09:36.677 --> 09:40.147
And I'm going to entertain all
points of view before I vote.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.683
Senator, this is all
a Red Wheatus operation.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.351
And if you change sides,
so will others,

09:44.384 --> 09:45.886
and we'll lose the majority.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.987
I'll call you back.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.856
(line beeps)
(sighs)

09:48.889 --> 09:51.024
Okay.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.660
I'm all ears.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.763
Why should I change
my vote on the war?

09:55.796 --> 09:58.031
(sighs) Damn it.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.668
Germaine, hi.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.035
Did you want me
to get Luke?

10:02.069 --> 10:04.404
No. I actually wanted
to talk to you.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.073
So you must be
weeks away now.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.042
Yes, next week.
But we might induce.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.878
Do you want to sit?
No.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.245
Is Luke
cheating on me?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.149
Is Luke?

10:16.183 --> 10:18.051
I don't think so. No. Why?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.053
Why? Because he cheated...

10:20.087 --> 10:22.389
No, no, I-I know
you've had issues in the past.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.892
I-I just thought
you two worked it out.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.927
Yes. But she's still here.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.101
(TV playing quietly)

10:34.134 --> 10:36.069
The only reason she's here
is because we're worried

10:36.103 --> 10:37.871
about a lawsuit; that's it.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.807
It's over between them.
How can you be sure?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.241
Because I am.

10:41.274 --> 10:44.812
Where were you last night
at 11:00 p.m.?

10:44.845 --> 10:47.047
Where was I?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.049
Yes.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.918
I don't know.
I guess I-I was here working.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.721
Why?
Luke said he was with you
last night.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.088
Right. Yeah,
that makes sense.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.389
At your home.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.760
TRUMP (over TV):
We can come back...

10:59.793 --> 11:00.761
Look, I don't feel
comfortable...

11:00.794 --> 11:02.029
(groans, hisses)

11:02.062 --> 11:03.997
Germaine, are you okay?

11:04.031 --> 11:07.801
Yeah, it's just...
this last month.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.002
She just kicks really hard.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.038
Do you want me
to get a doctor?

11:11.071 --> 11:13.006
Mm. No, no.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.743
They say it'll be over soon.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.178
God, it's like having
a monster inside me,

11:18.211 --> 11:19.747
the way she kicks.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.450
A monster?
Yeah.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.753
Look, this is weird.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.055
Every time she hears Trump
on TV,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.389
she just kicks out.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.490
TRUMP:
Strong, strong, strong.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.326
(groans)
It's weird.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.327
...Americans.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.764
See, and now
she's calm.

11:36.797 --> 11:40.033
America first.
Make the country great again.
And now... (groans)

11:40.067 --> 11:41.935
(groans)

11:41.969 --> 11:43.971
She just doesn't
like Trump, I guess.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.139
Germaine, I think
we should go to the hospital.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.475
No, it's fine.
It's just inconvenient.
Let's go.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.110
TRUMP: We are going to
(groans)

11:50.143 --> 11:52.245
make America rich again.
Germaine.

11:52.279 --> 11:55.082
Hmm?
You shouldn't feel this way.
Not like this.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.383
Okay? Come on.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.385
MONARCH: The campaign continues
to heat up,

11:58.418 --> 12:00.921
with charges
and countercharges flying.

12:00.954 --> 12:04.992
The only thing that is certain:
this will get uglier.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.393
Both candidates have...

12:06.426 --> 12:08.428
*

12:18.271 --> 12:19.506
Hello?

12:19.539 --> 12:21.241
BEN:
Okay, so this is what I decided.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.242
Ben?

12:22.275 --> 12:24.344
Yeah. You got a minute?
Sure.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.079
So I think you're right.

12:26.113 --> 12:29.116
I probably went a bit off-track
with the one-percent tirade.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.351
I get a bit angry.
That's okay.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.421
No, no. Thanks for
the constructive criticism.

12:34.454 --> 12:35.555
So I've got some interviews
lined up today

12:35.588 --> 12:37.057
about these extremist groups.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.026
Come by.
I want to show you some footage.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.360
Okay. I'll call you.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.361
All right, later.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.296
How'd it go?
Is that the sonogram?

12:43.330 --> 12:45.132
Uh, this is my sister.
Uh, it went well.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.434
Everything's healthy.
LUKE: And should

12:47.467 --> 12:49.402
we induce earlier?
No, no. We should be fine.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.071
Is there anything clearer
of the fetus's head?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.907
The, uh... No. Why?

12:53.941 --> 12:55.408
Is the sonogram
always so dark there?

12:55.442 --> 12:56.243
What are you
looking for?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.345
I just think
it would be good to-to do

12:58.378 --> 13:00.080
a general prenatal rundown
on Germaine's health.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.114
I just did.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.549
The kick tests
were normal.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.818
She was negative
for strep B...

13:04.852 --> 13:06.820
Luke, Germaine is in
a lot of pain.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.388
What else can
you do, Doctor?

13:08.421 --> 13:11.224
Well, uh, we could do
a biophysical profile,

13:11.258 --> 13:13.160
combine a stress test
with an ultrasound.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.162
But you'll have to bring
Germaine back; we're not set up

13:15.195 --> 13:16.997
for that right now.
I can do that.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.399
Okay. Uh, I'll
arrange a time.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.534
All right. Thanks.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.170
What, Laurel?

13:23.203 --> 13:24.838
(chuckles)
Laurel, what?

13:24.872 --> 13:27.307
Germaine didn't come
to the office to talk to you.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.608
She came there
to talk to me.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.443
Why?

13:30.477 --> 13:33.013
Because she thinks
you're cheating.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.015
(scoffs)
I'm not cheating.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.017
Where were you
at 11:00 p.m. last night?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.451
At work. Why?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.553
She asked if we were together
because you told her

13:40.587 --> 13:42.589
you were at my apartment.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.626
What did you tell her?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.528
Don't make me lie for you,
Luke, ever again.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.463
I-I wasn't
cheating on her.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.966
Look, I-I was with
the moderates,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.635
thinking through how
to deal with this craz...
That is such crap.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.604
What?
Stop lying. If you were
with the moderates,

13:57.637 --> 14:00.908
you would've told her that.
I... (stammers)

14:00.941 --> 14:03.610
I...

14:03.643 --> 14:04.912
I know.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.379
I don't know
why I do it.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.915
(sighs)

14:07.948 --> 14:10.583
I don't want to have
to e-explain myself.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.286
I go home, I don't want to
talk about the whole day.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.588
It's so much easier. It's-it's
like Holden Caulfield lying.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.959
It's not really...
Do you know how hard it is
to believe in you, Luke?

14:18.992 --> 14:21.461
I go to the office every day
and defend you

14:21.494 --> 14:23.596
and tell the constituents
what a great guy you are.
Look, I-I'm trying to make

14:23.630 --> 14:26.299
a difference. Do you know how
close the Senate is to anarchy?

14:26.333 --> 14:28.601
That is not an excuse.
I'm not saying it's an
excuse. I'm-I'm just saying

14:28.635 --> 14:32.205
it's like JFK...
Oh, come on. Do not use
the JFK thing.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.308
I'm not a perfect
person, Laurel...
It's not about being perfect.

14:35.342 --> 14:38.211
It's about not screwing around.
That's not a high threshold.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.680
(sighs)
Being perfect is here.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.184
This is not screwing around on
your nine-month-pregnant wife.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.418
So do it.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.921
And don't make me
lie for you again.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.356
I want to believe.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.258
What you're doing in the Senate
makes a difference,

14:51.291 --> 14:54.294
even more than you know,
but you have to stay true.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.939
You'll stop doing
whatever you're doing?

15:05.973 --> 15:07.440
Okay.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.682
Oh, good.
Just in time.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.684
Sorry, I got delayed.
No, everything's good.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.785
I'll show you what
footage I got afterwards.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.620
Come on. I wanted to catch
you before you came in.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.489
This guy doesn't
know the interview is

15:22.522 --> 15:24.091
about extremist groups,
so don't say anything.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.658
What's he think?
Uh, he thinks it's about

15:25.692 --> 15:29.029
Republican/Democrat
relationships. (scoffs)

15:29.062 --> 15:31.298
Laurel, hi.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.367
Hi.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.169
What are you doing?
He's not an extremist.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.304
I know.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.139
He's Red Wheatus's
chief of staff.

15:39.172 --> 15:42.009
He's the one who helped
astroturf this political group.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.012
Thanks for doing this, Gareth.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.980
No problem.
Any way I can help.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.382
If you don't mind, we're
gonna start taping now.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.984
Sure.

15:51.018 --> 15:55.122
So, thanks for sitting
with us, Mr. Ritter.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.224
Not many Republicans
even responded.

15:57.257 --> 16:01.028
Well, I'm trying to be more
accommodating across the aisle.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.365
And you're Red Wheatus's
chief of staff?
I am.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.735
So you have contact
with this group, the One Wayers?

16:08.768 --> 16:10.637
Some.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.106
Didn't you, in fact, help
to create this extremist group?

16:13.140 --> 16:14.707
I mean, didn't your
office create it?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.312
Sometimes our office
will recognize

16:19.346 --> 16:21.748
a certain shared opinion
by our supporters.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.251
Our office may offer guidance
to these individuals,

16:24.284 --> 16:25.752
but that's it.
Excuse me,

16:25.785 --> 16:28.455
Mr. Ritter, but I've interviewed
members of these groups,

16:28.488 --> 16:30.290
and they all seem
to be coordinating

16:30.323 --> 16:32.459
their bullet points with you.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.095
I think I'll stick
with my earlier answer.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.563
Oh, come on.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.397
You promised to be

16:37.430 --> 16:39.066
completely up-front
with us here,

16:39.099 --> 16:41.401
Mr. Ritter. Isn't it true
that the One Wayers

16:41.434 --> 16:43.103
wouldn't even exist without
your office creating them?

16:43.136 --> 16:44.804
Every grassroots movement
has funding from somewhere.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.274
And I don't really think
it matters if some of it

16:47.307 --> 16:49.276
was distributed
by my office...
Come on, Mr. Ritter.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.045
Isn't this
about the one percent?
Okay, that's enough.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.047
No, Laurel, I'm not done.
Yeah, I think we have enough.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.183
Uh, Mr. Ritter, will you
please sit back down?

16:56.216 --> 16:58.185
I just have
a few more questions.
No.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.453
Can you really defend
your position, Mr. Ritter?

17:00.487 --> 17:01.721
Can you really?

17:03.790 --> 17:06.193
Did you get it?
Yep.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.062
What's the problem?
This stuff was great.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.530
He looked completely
over his head.
It wasn't fair.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.532
Oh, come on. That's the
drama in documentaries.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.334
He didn't know it was gonna be
about those questions.
So?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.569
He's the enemy.
He's a Republican tool.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.706
You don't do the cause
any good by pulling back.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.378
I'm sorry.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.781
We can't do this anymore.

17:31.451 --> 17:35.688
What, so you're just...
breaking it off?

17:35.722 --> 17:38.225
I have a child
on the way.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.127
I have a wife.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.695
I don't want to marry you, Luke.
I just...

17:42.729 --> 17:45.732
want... you.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.769
Yes, but I have a child
on the way.

17:49.802 --> 17:53.173
I-I can't do this anymore.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.609
(crying)
Oh, come on.

17:56.643 --> 18:00.113
Come on, Margie.
No. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

18:00.147 --> 18:03.816
It's so sudden. I...
(groans)

18:03.850 --> 18:07.687
No, I-I can't. I just...
Come on. Mmm.

18:09.156 --> 18:13.092
This'll be
our good-bye, hmm?

18:14.494 --> 18:17.330
(grunting)

18:23.336 --> 18:24.804
Hi.
Hey.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.873
You have a minute?
I was just headed home.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.141
What do you need?

18:28.175 --> 18:29.176
I'll walk you.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.578
You don't have to.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.813
I know.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.816
That was wrong,
and I'm sorry.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.818
What are we
talking about here?

18:38.851 --> 18:42.222
Ben. I didn't know
he was gonna do that.

18:42.255 --> 18:45.325
Laurel, you don't
owe me anything.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.827
We're on opposite sides
of the aisle, you and I.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.696
It's all right.
Gareth, seriously,

18:49.729 --> 18:51.698
I didn't even know
you were gonna be there.
Laurel, look,

18:51.731 --> 18:53.933
we like each other.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.203
I won't deny it.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.372
But we're in a business
where it cannot work.

18:59.406 --> 19:02.209
This is our
worldviews.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.478
It's what I...
it's what I believe in.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.480
We can't just throw
that stuff overboard

19:07.514 --> 19:09.482
and pretend it
doesn't exist.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.318
For a friend, I can.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.820
Well, then you're a
better person than I am.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.956
Because if I throw that stuff
overboard, I'm not me anymore.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.825
Look, I accepted
that interview request

19:18.858 --> 19:20.960
because it's what I thought
I should do for a friend...

19:20.993 --> 19:22.695
I didn't know
he was inviting you...

19:22.729 --> 19:24.264
And then I realized,

19:24.297 --> 19:26.933
I have a job.

19:26.966 --> 19:30.937
I have a job that I love,
that I believe in.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.540
And this friendship
is hurting my job.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.342
I'm not trying...

19:35.375 --> 19:37.877
I didn't say
you were.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.846
It's structural.

19:42.549 --> 19:45.184
I just need to do my job, okay?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.722
Maybe when things
cool down.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.660
When will things ever cool down?

19:53.693 --> 19:56.296
I don't know.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.331
Soon, hopefully.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.902
I have to go home.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.539
Bye.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.746
There you are.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.748
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
There was this...

20:15.782 --> 20:17.584
thing that got in the way.
Nothing important.

20:17.617 --> 20:20.019
Has the doctor seen you?
Yeah.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.153
The biophysical profile

20:21.187 --> 20:23.590
and the sonogram with
the stress test looked great.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.658
He took some blood
just to be 100% sure

20:25.692 --> 20:28.261
there's not an infection
going on, but he's not worried.

20:28.295 --> 20:28.961
DOCTOR:
Hello.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.331
Here's your sister-in-law.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.400
Yes. She wanted to hear
about the results, too.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.735
Good, good. I just need
to talk to her for a second,

20:35.768 --> 20:37.337
Germaine, if
you don't mind.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.038
I'm not in danger, am I?

20:39.071 --> 20:43.042
No, no, no. I just wanted
to talk to her for a second.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.944
(door closes)

20:44.977 --> 20:46.946
What's wrong? Is there something
wrong with the sonogram?

20:46.979 --> 20:50.383
You love your sister-in-law,
don't you, Ms. Healy?

20:50.417 --> 20:52.419
Yes, of-of course. Why?

20:52.452 --> 20:54.287
Then I need to ask
something of you.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.022
What? What's wrong?

20:56.055 --> 20:57.624
Stop.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.892
Stop what?
Stop worrying her.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.295
Stop making her think that
there's something wrong.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.531
There is nothing wrong.
She is a healthy mother-to-be.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.299
Are you sure?

21:06.333 --> 21:09.469
Ms. Healy, the only thing
wrong with Germaine

21:09.502 --> 21:11.638
is that she has you
making her nervous.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.606
So stop it.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.342
I just want to be sure.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.544
I'm sure. Now go home.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.413
Take Germaine home
and let it rest.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.084
I'm sorry.
No problem.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.286
Now take her home.

21:31.358 --> 21:34.026
("You Might Think" by The Cars
playing quietly)

21:44.737 --> 21:45.705
(music stops)

21:45.738 --> 21:46.839
Hello?

21:54.447 --> 21:55.882
I just feel like something's
wrong. Have you heard of him?

21:55.915 --> 21:57.650
Dr. Falcon? Um, no.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.652
What'd he say?

21:59.686 --> 22:02.021
He did biological profile and
some stress test with sonogram.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.690
Did he show you
the results?

22:03.723 --> 22:05.725
No. That's worrisome, isn't it?

22:05.758 --> 22:06.593
I don't know. Not necessarily.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.561
He asked me to stop
making her nervous,

22:08.595 --> 22:10.930
and I was going to,
until I heard his ringtone.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.966
Just give me a sec.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.803
Hey. Can you take this?

22:16.836 --> 22:18.605
Thanks.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.746
Do you think everyone who
listens to the song is infected?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.515
No, but it's a very old song.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.049
It's kind of odd to be using it.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.852
Yes, but yesterday
I found myself humming it

22:32.885 --> 22:36.556
because it's out there
and people are listening to it.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.990
It's infectious.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.859
You think I'm overreacting?

22:39.892 --> 22:42.529
No. I don't know.

22:42.562 --> 22:45.432
I just am not sure
an infant can be infected.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.735
I'm going crazy, aren't I?

22:48.768 --> 22:50.937
This is how it starts.
No.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.740
Look, I will check out
this doctor

22:53.773 --> 22:55.775
and see what I can find out.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.043
(Jaime moaning)

22:57.076 --> 22:58.911
JAIME:
Oh, I'm gonna miss you so much.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.913
LUKE: I have to stop.
JAIME: Don't stop.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.015
(moaning, panting)

23:05.117 --> 23:08.488
I'm taking a new job
at Jackson Birch.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.691
Here's my new info.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.093
Look, I already told you, Jaime.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.763
This is it.
I have a child on the way.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.065
I know, I know. But here.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.769
For a rainy day.

23:22.802 --> 23:23.803
Bye.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.743
(door opens, closes)

23:33.913 --> 23:35.882
(sighs)

23:37.884 --> 23:39.118
Hey. Thanks for
doing this.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.753
I lost my cameraman
to a bris.

23:40.787 --> 23:41.954
You don't mind
taking over?

23:41.988 --> 23:43.122
No problem.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.857
Like old times.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.693
The union protest.
Remember?
(chuckles)

23:50.162 --> 23:52.665
What are you doing?
What do you mean?

23:52.699 --> 23:54.734
This guy's...
this guy's dangerous.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.135
Yeah, I know.
It's great, isn't it?

23:56.168 --> 23:58.004
No, seriously, Ben.
I know.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.739
It's perfect for the extremists.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.740
Really wild-eyed,

24:00.773 --> 24:01.908
foaming at the mouth.

24:01.941 --> 24:02.909
Ben, listen to me.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.210
This is a guy with a knife.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.212
Uh, no. I checked his tote bag.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.648
He could get violent; you
need to treat him carefully.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.116
Look, it's like Vice.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.918
You hear an explosion,
you head toward it,

24:11.951 --> 24:13.252
not away from it.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.921
Someone tries to punch you,
you fight back,

24:14.954 --> 24:16.155
but with a camera.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.490
Come on.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.458
It's for the cause, right?

24:20.727 --> 24:23.696
Hi, Noah.
Nice to meet you.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.532
Why don't you, uh,
take the tote bag

24:25.565 --> 24:26.933
off your shoulder there.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.603
Mm... no. I'm good.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.939
BEN:
Terrific. Let's begin.

24:32.972 --> 24:36.142
So, clearly, you're very angry
at the status quo in D.C.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.678
Aren't you concerned
your platform has been

24:38.711 --> 24:40.880
bought and paid for by
the very people you oppose?

24:40.913 --> 24:42.515
I...

24:42.549 --> 24:43.783
What?

24:43.816 --> 24:45.785
You do oppose the Republicans.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.520
Why are you letting them
finance you?

24:47.554 --> 24:50.189
I am not letting
them finance me.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.924
I'm-I'm following my issues.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.193
Do you want a war?

24:54.226 --> 24:55.828
No.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.163
I want to end human
rights violations.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.264
By causing a war?

24:58.297 --> 25:01.100
Do you consider yourself
a peacenik, sir?

25:01.133 --> 25:04.036
"Peacenik" is an outdated term.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.805
But you do consider yourself
against violence?

25:05.838 --> 25:07.006
Yes.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.908
BEN: Then why the hell
are you working with

25:08.941 --> 25:10.543
Republicans and bankers
who want to kill?

25:10.577 --> 25:11.944
I am not.
Yes, you are.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.245
Go to hell.
Ooh.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.047
Now, there's an
intelligent response.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.249
Is that all
you have to say?

25:17.283 --> 25:19.085
Come on.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.554
You're such an ass.
What are you gonna do?
Ben...

25:21.588 --> 25:22.989
No, if he wants
to do something, do it.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.023
(yells)

25:24.891 --> 25:26.559
(yells)

25:26.593 --> 25:28.294
God, this is great.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.198
You wanted that to happen.
Yeah.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.566
We got lucky.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.801
You baited him.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.603
No. I asked
him questions.

25:36.636 --> 25:37.804
Wasn't up to me
what he did.

25:37.837 --> 25:38.805
That's honest.

25:38.838 --> 25:40.773
What he did was
honest, yes.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.742
Look at it.
That's honest.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.911
Ah, what's wrong?

25:44.944 --> 25:47.013
This is good filmmaking?

25:47.046 --> 25:48.881
No, this just an event.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.850
Something that happened.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.253
What we do with it, how we
edit it, that's good filmmaking.

25:57.156 --> 26:00.860
Laurel, I was asked to make
a short viral documentary

26:00.893 --> 26:02.662
that would stop the Republicans
from fighting

26:02.695 --> 26:03.896
another non-war
in the Middle East.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.899
That's the reason
I did this.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.167
Am I missing something?

26:08.200 --> 26:11.203
No. No, you're not
missing anything.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.040
How goes the war?

26:14.073 --> 26:18.177
Uh, despite the CIA leak,
still on track, amazingly.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.680
But I've got
some moves left.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.882
Might be time for you
to vote with your head

26:22.915 --> 26:24.751
and not with your heart.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.753
Meaning?

26:26.786 --> 26:28.020
Vote for the war.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.623
You're kidding.

26:30.657 --> 26:34.360
Luke, you need to start thinking
farther out, the long term.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.095
There's a new Wall
Street Journal poll

26:36.128 --> 26:37.964
out this morning...
Screw that.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.967
I'm gonna bomb 100,000 Syrians
because of a poll?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.702
Luke, look at me.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.371
Uh, don't do
the "look at me" thing.

26:49.408 --> 26:53.713
That big white house
over there...

26:53.746 --> 26:55.815
it's yours for the taking.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.650
So take it.

27:03.355 --> 27:06.693
(crowd clamoring)

27:06.726 --> 27:08.327
NARRATOR:
America has gotten angrier.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.062
(crowd shouting)

27:12.198 --> 27:13.833
(yells)

27:13.866 --> 27:16.335
NARRATOR: The One Wayers are
angry at the No Wayers,

27:16.368 --> 27:19.806
and the No Wayers are angry
at the One Wayers.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.340
And who benefits?

27:23.342 --> 27:25.712
The one percent.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.880
Who wants this war?

27:27.914 --> 27:29.949
Wall Street.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.318
The rise of big bankers.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.386
Financial inequality.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.689
Every grassroots movement
has funding from somewhere,

27:36.723 --> 27:38.057
and I don't really think
it matters

27:38.090 --> 27:40.827
if some of it is distributed
by my office.

27:40.860 --> 27:41.961
BEN:
Come on, Mr. Ritter.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.462
Isn't this about
the one percent?

27:43.495 --> 27:45.698
Uh, Mr. Ritter,
will you please sit back down?

27:45.732 --> 27:47.066
No.
I just have a few
more questions.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.835
Can you really defend
your position, Mr. Ritter?

27:48.868 --> 27:50.102
Can you...

27:53.873 --> 27:55.241
Well?

27:55.274 --> 27:57.977
Well, not everything
is about Wall Street, Ben.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.012
Oh, come on, that's
not what it's about.

28:00.046 --> 28:02.782
I agree, but that's what
your documentary is about.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.917
Is this about your
Republican friend?

28:04.951 --> 28:06.118
No. This is about
your documentary.

28:06.152 --> 28:07.987
This is about
a creative disagreement.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.088
Okay. At a certain point,

28:09.121 --> 28:10.456
we all have
our individual opinions

28:10.489 --> 28:12.158
and we need a pair
of fresh eyes.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.425
So let's hand it in

28:13.459 --> 28:15.294
and get those
fresh eyes.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.479
(audio rewinding)

28:33.512 --> 28:36.115
Every grassroots movement
has funding from somewhere,

28:36.148 --> 28:38.017
and I don't really think
it matters

28:38.050 --> 28:40.452
if some of it is distributed
by my office.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.489
(ringtone chiming)

28:47.193 --> 28:48.260
Laurel Healy.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.361
ROCHELLE:
Where are you?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.263
Germaine's water just broke.
What?

28:51.297 --> 28:53.032
I was doing another sonogram
with Germaine,

28:53.065 --> 28:54.266
and her water broke.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.068
I can't get her OB/GYN.
She's here.

28:56.102 --> 28:57.303
What-- Is Luke there?
No.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.005
She couldn't get ahold
of anyone.

28:59.038 --> 29:00.272
(gasps)
Is that Luke?

29:00.306 --> 29:01.473
ROCHELLE:
Just hang in there, Germaine.

29:01.507 --> 29:02.909
I'm on my way.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.077
Good. I would get here fast.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.345
Is everything normal?

29:06.378 --> 29:08.781
I didn't get a chance
to look deeper.

29:08.815 --> 29:09.782
(groans)

29:09.816 --> 29:11.884
Get this thing out of me!

29:11.918 --> 29:12.518
ROCHELLE:
We'll find out soon enough.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.752
I'll see you in a minute.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.128
She's beautiful. She's just...

29:22.161 --> 29:24.230
Everything went okay?
Yes.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.032
Best day ever.
LUKE: She's amazing.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.133
You're amazing.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.001
And completely healthy, right?

29:29.035 --> 29:31.003
Yes, Laurel.
(Luke clears throat)

29:31.037 --> 29:34.106
I don't know how to say
what I want to say

29:34.140 --> 29:35.441
to both of you.

29:35.474 --> 29:36.308
To all of you.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.410
You don't have to
make a speech, Luke.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.846
Daddy thinks he's still at work.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.213
(chuckles)
She has your eyes.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.414
Lucky girl.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.283
Ah, but those might
be Daddy's ears.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.517
Did you check her ears?

29:45.551 --> 29:47.053
ROCHELLE:
They're fine.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.287
Why are you asking
so many questions?

29:48.320 --> 29:49.588
Is something wrong?
No.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.057
'Cause she does look like
she has Luke's ears.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.291
Can I... can I see?

29:52.324 --> 29:53.826
ROCHELLE:
Hey, Laurel?

29:53.860 --> 29:54.861
Laurel?

29:54.894 --> 29:56.162
(clears throat)

29:56.195 --> 29:57.496
LUKE:
Let's call her...

29:57.529 --> 30:00.132
Grace?

30:00.166 --> 30:02.134
That's what she is.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.602
Hello, Grace.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.604
(chuckles):
Look at that expression.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.139
What's she thinking?

30:07.173 --> 30:08.340
Probably pooping.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.042
(laughs)

30:12.945 --> 30:16.148
I know I haven't always been
the best husband.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.217
But...

30:18.250 --> 30:20.853
it will be different now.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.490
You have to stop. You'll
worry them over nothing.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.325
Did you check her hearing?
Yes.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.160
If she was infected in the womb,

30:28.194 --> 30:29.361
her ears would be fine.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.363
She has had every
medical test possible.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.200
An MRI of the brain?

30:34.233 --> 30:38.905
Laurel, I will not sedate
her to ease your fears.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.241
Baby's normal.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.275
(chuckles)

30:47.279 --> 30:48.314
LAUREL:
Where's Luke?

30:48.347 --> 30:50.482
He had to go.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.284
(baby fussing)

30:52.318 --> 30:53.519
Well, there's this
war resolution...

30:53.552 --> 30:55.187
Scarlett called.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.223
And we might be
outnumbered.
Don't.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.297
Can I hold her?

31:11.337 --> 31:14.340
Welcome to the world.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.575
Is there really
a war resolution?

31:16.608 --> 31:18.277
Yes.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.184
I can't stop.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.685
I tried, but I can't.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.520
Then see a therapist.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.456
Or go to a support
group, or read a book.

31:30.489 --> 31:34.160
It's not complicated.
Keep your pants zipped.

31:34.193 --> 31:37.296
But-but... how?

31:37.329 --> 31:39.665
Here's a hint: Don't meet women
in their apartments.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.901
Don't meet women in hotel rooms.
Don't meet women in bars!

31:44.203 --> 31:45.204
Wait.

31:50.676 --> 31:53.045
The video you sent me,
the documentary,

31:53.079 --> 31:55.314
it's useless;
I can't use it.
I didn't send you...

31:55.347 --> 31:57.083
I thought you were handling
the one percent stuff.

31:57.116 --> 31:59.351
Look, I want a propaganda piece
about the war.

31:59.385 --> 32:00.619
I'm losing the vote.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.654
Even Dad thinks
I should vote for it.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.323
I need this.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.260
NARRATOR:
And who benefits?

32:08.294 --> 32:11.430
The one percent.

32:13.199 --> 32:15.434
I didn't want to leave
without saying good-bye.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.136
Right.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.241
Um...

32:22.274 --> 32:23.742
It's okay, Ben.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.412
What's okay?

32:26.445 --> 32:28.280
I'm, um...

32:28.314 --> 32:30.382
I'm in something
right now.

32:30.416 --> 32:34.086
You are? What?

32:34.120 --> 32:36.989
Something.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.257
Well,

32:38.290 --> 32:40.292
we made a hell of a video.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.168
Keep fighting the
good fight here.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.620
(crowd clamoring)

33:22.568 --> 33:24.636
Our country has been overrun.

33:30.542 --> 33:33.412
(crowd clamoring)

33:33.445 --> 33:34.713
(yells)

33:37.583 --> 33:41.320
Not with soldiers,
not with tanks,

33:41.353 --> 33:43.355
but with...

33:46.492 --> 33:49.328
...an infection.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.469
The infection is an idea.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.471
An idea of revolution.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.440
Extremism.

34:01.473 --> 34:04.576
Not just Republican,
but Democrat.

34:08.514 --> 34:09.481
BEN:
A few more questions.

34:09.515 --> 34:12.184
Can you really defend
your position, Mr. Rit...

34:23.495 --> 34:25.497
*

34:33.672 --> 34:35.674
(gentle piano music playing)

34:40.279 --> 34:42.714
I know we haven't, uh...

34:42.748 --> 34:45.517
been together for a while.

34:45.551 --> 34:49.488
But to be clear,
we won't again.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.590
And you have to
find another job.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.560
What?

34:54.593 --> 34:57.763
Uh, you'll get severance
and the best referral.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.266
You can't just get rid of me.

35:00.299 --> 35:03.235
I wouldn't use those words,
but, as of now,

35:03.269 --> 35:04.670
you no longer work for me.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.308
Uh, hey...

35:09.341 --> 35:10.609
Don't touch me.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.778
You weak man.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.514
I'm sorry.

35:15.547 --> 35:18.350
Sorry doesn't come
close to what you are.

35:18.384 --> 35:19.651
Okay, uh...

35:22.721 --> 35:24.523
Give my regards to Germaine.

35:24.556 --> 35:27.593
She's not part of this.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.495
All right.

35:33.399 --> 35:35.567
I'll give my regards.

35:47.613 --> 35:50.882
(choir humming)

35:50.916 --> 35:53.319
LAUREL:
Our country has been overrun.

35:53.352 --> 35:56.422
Not with soldiers,
not with tanks,

35:56.455 --> 35:58.690
but with an infection.
(video stops)

36:01.693 --> 36:03.529
Stop betraying America!

36:03.562 --> 36:04.596
Vote for the war!

36:04.630 --> 36:06.432
Stops human rights
abuses in Syria!

36:06.465 --> 36:08.534
Vote for the war!

36:08.567 --> 36:10.636
LAUREL:
An infection of extremism.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.571
An infection
that pursues purity

36:12.604 --> 36:14.906
and believes it's better
to burn down the government

36:14.940 --> 36:18.644
and start over than
to compromise even one iota.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.778
JULES:
I'm angry.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.913
Since when can the government
just do what it wants?

36:21.947 --> 36:23.915
NOAH: This is why voters
have to get involved:

36:23.949 --> 36:26.518
to show politicians
how angry we are.

36:26.552 --> 36:28.720
We are angry.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.722
Tell a woman to do something!

36:30.756 --> 36:33.725
Then maybe we can name
something after a woman.

36:33.759 --> 36:36.228
LAUREL: The extremist leaders
are collaborating in secret.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.466
They have more in common
with each other

36:40.499 --> 36:41.767
than they do
with their own party.

36:45.571 --> 36:48.707
RED: See, that's why
they call it "the grassroots."

36:48.740 --> 36:50.008
'Cause it's so stupid.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.544
(chuckles):
I could go out on Fifth Avenue

36:52.578 --> 36:55.847
with a flamethrower,
and they'd still kiss my feet.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.483
(chuckles):
Right?

36:57.516 --> 36:59.451
LAUREL: Tell your senators
and congressmen

36:59.485 --> 37:02.488
to vote against this war.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.257
After all,
their voices should echo ours.

37:05.291 --> 37:09.361
RED: Jesus should be asking me
for forgiveness.

37:09.395 --> 37:10.696
LAUREL:
We decide.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.264
(loud crash)

37:12.298 --> 37:14.466
And that is the point.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.468
(chuckles softly)

37:16.502 --> 37:19.004
DIANE:
Senator Pollack?

37:19.037 --> 37:20.439
ELLA:
Aye.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.573
DIANE:
Senator Wheatus?

37:21.607 --> 37:23.041
RED:
Aye, damn it.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.476
DIANE:
Belligerence noted.

37:24.510 --> 37:25.744
Senator Healy?

37:25.777 --> 37:26.645
No.

37:26.678 --> 37:29.481
And the chair votes no,

37:29.515 --> 37:30.382
damn it.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.751
(applause)
The war resolution is defeated

37:32.784 --> 37:34.786
and will not be sent
to the full Senate.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.889
Senator, with all due respect,
the American people...

37:37.923 --> 37:40.025
The American people sent us here

37:40.058 --> 37:45.431
to make informed, intelligent
decisions on their behalf.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.633
And that is the point.

37:47.666 --> 37:48.634
(scoffs)

37:48.667 --> 37:50.336
(applause)

37:52.571 --> 37:55.741
Some are calling it
"the little video that could."

37:55.774 --> 37:57.309
And it really did,
didn't it?

37:57.343 --> 38:00.612
You know, Claudia, the country
needed a wake-up call.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.481
I'm just happy I could make the
point that needed to be made.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.550
It's been seen by the members of

38:04.583 --> 38:06.418
the Senate Intelligence
Committee, as well as

38:06.452 --> 38:08.987
over four million
people online.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.989
More important, it
probably saved us

38:11.022 --> 38:12.558
from another
needless war.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.726
How the hell did
you do all that?
Yeah, how?

38:14.760 --> 38:16.662
BEN: Someone needed to focus
on the big picture.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.631
This isn't a left or right
issue, it's about extremism.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.868
The kind of mindless debate that
leads us to forget who we are.

38:22.901 --> 38:23.869
(ringtone chiming)

38:23.902 --> 38:24.803
CLAUDIA:
I'm curious, Ben.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.373
Where did the idea
to do this come from?

38:27.406 --> 38:29.708
I mean, it's so provocative,
so elegantly done.

38:29.741 --> 38:30.809
Hello?

38:30.842 --> 38:32.110
Can you believe this guy?

38:32.143 --> 38:33.712
I'm used to it.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.414
I know it was you.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.048
I recognized your
barely contained contempt

38:37.082 --> 38:38.884
for anyone that thinks
differently than you do.

38:38.917 --> 38:42.020
I don't know, I thought
I contained it well.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.089
...when asked how he sculpted
his magnificent David,

38:44.122 --> 38:45.657
how he did it,

38:45.691 --> 38:47.693
Michelangelo said,
"It was actually easy."

38:47.726 --> 38:49.595
He said all he had to do was

38:49.628 --> 38:51.463
chip away at this
big hunk of rock

38:51.497 --> 38:53.465
and remove everything
that wasn't David.

38:53.499 --> 38:55.100
(sighs) You did good.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.436
I would've liked to have seen
Reagan in there with FDR.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.571
Next time.

38:59.605 --> 39:02.774
You could've used me.

39:02.808 --> 39:04.476
I didn't come off well.

39:07.813 --> 39:10.348
You didn't fit in the story
I was telling.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.620
Okay.

39:14.653 --> 39:16.955
I just called to say
congratulations.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.990
Bye.

39:24.496 --> 39:26.498
(baby fussing)

39:30.469 --> 39:32.504
Shh, okay?

39:32.538 --> 39:33.805
Shh.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.547
Hey.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.784
She sounds so happy,
looking up at you.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.018
She won't go to sleep.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.555
Where did that come from?

39:49.588 --> 39:51.790
I bought it.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.825
It's supposed to be soothing.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.030
Honey...

39:59.064 --> 40:01.166
Mm.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.068
I've missed you.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.704
I want you to
know I'm back.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.806
I'm here.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.576
I have missed you.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.177
It was a good day.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.746
Fighting back the
Philistines. (chuckles)

40:14.780 --> 40:16.515
That's nice.

40:16.548 --> 40:20.586
I know bringing this little girl
into the world wasn't easy,

40:20.619 --> 40:22.420
but now that
she's here...

40:26.492 --> 40:28.827
Luke, honey.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.862
Not now. I...

40:32.864 --> 40:34.866
I feel a little sweaty.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.137
Sure.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.813
(fussing)

40:55.253 --> 40:57.222
(crying)

40:57.255 --> 40:59.224
(whispers):
Stop it.

40:59.257 --> 41:01.459
(crying continues)

41:03.261 --> 41:05.531
