Ow!

01:30.734 --> 01:32.100
Hi, honey.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.100
I just wanted to make sure
you were still alive.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.701
Sometimes
it's hard to tell.

01:36.701 --> 01:38.667
There's an
easier way, Peg.

01:38.667 --> 01:43.534
Dead men don't
wake up yelling, "No!"

01:43.534 --> 01:46.367
Well, I just wanted
to be sure.

You know,
it would be just like you

01:48.267 --> 01:49.968
to drop dead
in front of this TV

looking forward

01:56.868 --> 01:58.934
to a shoe convention.

01:58.934 --> 02:00.234
Well, I'm not.

02:00.234 --> 02:02.200

02:13.133 --> 02:14.834
Oh, I'm nothing special.

02:14.834 --> 02:15.834
Just a wife.

02:15.834 --> 02:18.400
Mm. You claim.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.467
Anyway, Peg, I'm just not
really looking forward

02:20.467 --> 02:23.133
to speaking
in front of all those people.

02:23.133 --> 02:24.434
I mean,
who started that tradition

02:24.434 --> 02:25.834
that the man
who makes the least

02:25.834 --> 02:28.534
has to introduce the man
who makes the most?

02:28.534 --> 02:29.834
Honey, you ought to be proud.

02:29.834 --> 02:31.434
I mean, no one else

02:31.434 --> 02:35.167
has held that honor
for seven years in a row.

02:35.167 --> 02:37.534
Why, hissing and booing you

02:37.534 --> 02:41.300
actually seems to energize
the whole convention.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.434
Peg, do you get
a special bonus or something

02:44.434 --> 02:46.834
if I don't reach 50?

02:46.834 --> 02:49.000
Gee, I'm not really sure.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.467
I should check.

But, honey, I don't what you
to ruin this convention for me.

in this house,

03:03.801 --> 03:05.868
watching that TV
all day long.

03:05.868 --> 03:07.067
You owe me.

03:12.934 --> 03:14.834
Yeah, you're right.

never stop and think of you

You know, Peg,

03:40.601 --> 03:42.400
you could just
put a straw in my ear,

03:42.400 --> 03:44.667
and that way you could just
suck the life directly from me.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.601
You know, I would,

03:47.601 --> 03:49.467
but there's just
not enough room in there

No, Al.

12:17.734 --> 12:20.734
I believe you got to have
faith in your vision.

12:20.734 --> 12:22.734
I had a dream
of my own once,

12:22.734 --> 12:25.367
an idea whose time
had truly come.

12:25.367 --> 12:27.367
Oh, God, Steve,
don't tell everyone

12:27.367 --> 12:30.133
about your insane quest
to create a 99-cent coin.

12:30.133 --> 12:31.033
Al...

12:33.767 --> 12:38.000
I invented
the 99-cent coin.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.834
Have you ever noticed
how things cost...

12:41.834 --> 12:44.701
$7.99?

12:44.701 --> 12:46.767
Fourteen dollars <i>and</i> 99 cents?

12:46.767 --> 12:49.868
Ninety-nine dollars
and 99 cents?

12:49.868 --> 12:52.767
Well, my coin would eliminate
the messy change

12:52.767 --> 12:54.367
that only catches the attention

12:54.367 --> 12:55.834
of those obnoxious beggars
who hassle you

12:55.834 --> 12:58.767
on your way to your Mercedes.

12:58.767 --> 13:00.634
Think of it, Al.

13:00.634 --> 13:01.767
Anything you want.

13:01.767 --> 13:05.467
You just plunk down
old number 99.

13:05.467 --> 13:07.334
It's a plan without flaws.

13:07.334 --> 13:09.067
What about tax?

13:13.634 --> 13:17.501
You sound just like those fools
in the Treasury department.

13:17.501 --> 13:20.334
Well, dear, maybe
if you didn't insist

13:20.334 --> 13:24.000
on putting your picture
on the coin.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.200
Who should it
have been, yours?

13:25.200 --> 13:27.801
The important thing is, Al,

13:27.801 --> 13:29.601
you gotta see your dream
through, buddy.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.534
All they can do is laugh at you.

13:31.534 --> 13:34.667
And audit you for
five straight years.

some of that nice cocoa

13:41.234 --> 13:43.067

all warm and sleepy

13:43.067 --> 13:45.033
for two or three days.

Yes. I believe
I'd like some nice cocoa

13:49.567 --> 13:51.701

of a stranger's arms.

start rolling in,
