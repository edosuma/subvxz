Let's go over the timeline
of the abductions.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.381
Maybe that'll give us a clue
into the, uh, motive.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.601
- Uh, the timestamp on
Dr. Caldwell's video doorbell

08:34.644 --> 08:37.517
shows that his abduction
took place at 6:23 a.m.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.257
Dr. Wright was
approximately taken

08:39.301 --> 08:40.607
an hour and a half later.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.826

that the trunk size

08:42.870 --> 08:44.915
of the grey BMW
is 16 cubic feet.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.048
Dr. Caldwell
is about 180 pounds

08:47.091 --> 08:48.876
and 6 feet tall.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.442
- Which means
it's highly doubtful

08:50.486 --> 08:52.053
he was still in the trunk
of the BMW

08:52.096 --> 08:53.402
when Dr. Wright
was placed there.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.838
- All right,
so the abductor either

08:54.882 --> 08:58.059
stashed or killed Caldwell
before grabbing Wright,

08:58.102 --> 09:01.192
