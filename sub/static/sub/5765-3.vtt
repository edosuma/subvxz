00:01.800 --> 00:03.267
Previously on
The Good Wife:

00:03.300 --> 00:05.063
And hour ago I resigned

00:05.100 --> 00:06.761
as State's Attorney
of Cook County.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.735
I want to be clear-- _
I have never abused my office.

00:09.770 --> 00:12.204
At the same time,
I need to atone for

00:12.240 --> 00:15.232
my personal failings
with my wife Alicia
and our two children.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.339
Just wanted to say thank
you for the opportunity.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.541
It's a real lifesaver.
No, glad you could
come aboard.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.810
I'm Cary, the other
new associate.
Oh, right.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.249
Kalinda Sharma.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.781
I'm the in-house.
Oh, the investigator.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.617
You're Peter Florrick's wife.
That's right.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.582
She's a junior associate
who doesn't think

00:29.630 --> 00:31.222
she's a junior associate.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.591
Her husband was
the States Attorney.

00:32.630 --> 00:33.790
She lived
in Highland Park.

00:33.830 --> 00:35.650
Dad told us he made mistakes.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.759
Yeah, but not that.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.336
Ryan thinks there's
a good chance

00:39.370 --> 00:41.463
the appellate court's going
to listen to my case.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.731
If they overturn it,
everything goes back to normal.

00:44.770 --> 00:47.170
Peter, it's never
going back to normal.

01:01.690 --> 01:04.079
Come on, guys, 15 minutes.

01:06.730 --> 01:09.426
Grace, come on,
you got to eat.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.234
And soccer tryouts are today.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.195
Mom, I hate this school.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.730
Why would I want
to play for it?

01:15.770 --> 01:19.206
Grandma's going to pick you up
at the field around five-ish.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.231
I can't find my cleats aanay.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.703
And you're telling
me this now?

01:25.450 --> 01:27.213
They're probably still packed.
(phone ringing)

01:27.250 --> 01:29.115
You can at least try
and like it here.

01:29.150 --> 01:30.185
Just try.

01:33.290 --> 01:34.109
Hello.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.128
AUTOMATED VOICE:
This is a collect call

01:36.160 --> 01:38.287
from Tamms Correctional
Institution from...

01:38.330 --> 01:39.854
(electronic tones)
PETER:
Peter Florrick.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.492
AUTOMATED VOICE:
To decline this call
press one.

01:41.530 --> 01:42.861
To accept this call
press two.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.737
Hey, Peter.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.738
Hi. Is this a good time?

01:48.770 --> 01:50.601
Sure.
Are you all right?

01:53.280 --> 01:54.736
The kids there?
Can I talk to them?

01:54.780 --> 01:56.702
Actually Zach is in the shower

01:56.750 --> 01:58.308
and Grace just sat down
to breakfast.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.840
Oh.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.609
(sighs)

02:01.650 --> 02:03.538
I tried to call earlier.

02:03.590 --> 02:04.909
It's been a long line.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.589
So...

02:12.360 --> 02:14.726
I guess we used to be
more comfortable

02:14.760 --> 02:16.193
with each other's silences, huh?

02:18.600 --> 02:20.795
I'm sorry, it's just
we're really running late.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.498
Yeah.

02:24.540 --> 02:26.269
I'll let you go.

02:26.310 --> 02:28.278
Tell them I called, okay?

02:28.310 --> 02:30.278
Okay, I will.
Bye.

02:31.310 --> 02:32.811
Bye.

02:33.580 --> 02:34.774
Found 'em.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.799
We shouldn't have had to move.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.804
WILL:
The first year
associate's primary job

03:01.840 --> 03:03.603
is to clock billable hours.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.777
And with most of
those numbers down

03:05.810 --> 03:07.368
in each of your departments,

03:07.420 --> 03:09.411
clearly some of you
aren't doing yours.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.748
DIANE:
Now, that's not to say that
you're all underperforming.

03:11.790 --> 03:14.611
One of our newest
assocnates clocked

03:14.660 --> 03:17.720
225 hours last month alone.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.921
But most of you
can do better.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.269
So while this meeting
isn't about naming names,

03:22.300 --> 03:24.495
it is about asking you
to step up.

03:24.530 --> 03:27.237
And if you can't do that,
at least sign a few new clients.

03:27.270 --> 03:28.532
(all chuckling)

03:28.570 --> 03:29.764
Pardon
the interruption,

03:29.810 --> 03:31.505
but someone's here
to see Mrs. Florrick.

03:31.540 --> 03:32.973
_ I believe
It's her son.

03:33.010 --> 03:36.639
I'm so sorry.
Please excuse me.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.849
Kenny?

03:48.720 --> 03:50.984
Kenny, is that--
is that you?

03:51.030 --> 03:52.292
Mrs. Florrick.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.854
It's been awhile, huh?

03:55.900 --> 03:57.390
You're--

03:57.430 --> 03:58.795
grown.

03:58.830 --> 03:59.933
Are you parents with you?

03:59.970 --> 04:02.507
What are you-- what
are you doing here?

04:02.540 --> 04:04.531
I think I need a lawyer.

04:04.570 --> 04:07.004
Last night,

04:07.040 --> 04:07.904
me and this guy Brian

04:07.940 --> 04:10.602
we went to my buddy's
house to get, uh...

04:10.650 --> 04:12.515
We were just looking
to party, you know.

04:12.550 --> 04:13.778
To get what?

04:13.820 --> 04:16.038
Some dank.

04:16.080 --> 04:19.049
Weed or whatever.

04:19.090 --> 04:20.648
Aanay, right after
we got there,

04:20.690 --> 04:22.282
this security guard
rolls up and, um...

04:22.330 --> 04:23.888
And?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.557
I kind of freaked.

04:25.590 --> 04:26.750
So I ran.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.893
This morning when
I went by Bri's house,

04:28.930 --> 04:31.865
there were cops there.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.698
I heard he got arrested.
What are you doing?

04:34.740 --> 04:35.695
What is this?

04:35.740 --> 04:38.038
I figure they're
after me next.

04:40.110 --> 04:42.544
Look,

04:42.580 --> 04:44.343
I'm not sure I understand
what happened,

04:44.380 --> 04:45.938
but if you were buying pot...

04:45.980 --> 04:47.572
We weren't.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.814
Spencer was giving it to us.

04:48.850 --> 04:50.738
The bottom line is,
if you broke the law

04:50.790 --> 04:52.417
you need to go to the police.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.714
Yeah, but-- I'd still need
a lawyer, right?

04:58.730 --> 05:00.527
Don't move.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.664
And get rid of that.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.868
Kalinda.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.902
Your kid's older than I thought.

05:09.940 --> 05:10.964
Oh, he's not mine.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.478
Listen, can I ask
you a favor?

05:13.510 --> 05:15.933
Will you find out if there
was any police activity in
Highland Park last night?

05:15.980 --> 05:18.107
And see if Kenny Chatham
is a person of interest

05:18.150 --> 05:19.970
or if there are any warrants

05:20.020 --> 05:21.112
out on him.
For?

05:21.150 --> 05:24.039
Pot, possession,
possibly buying.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.046
So if he's not a relative,

05:26.090 --> 05:27.409
who is he?

05:27.460 --> 05:28.711
I knew his mom.

05:34.430 --> 05:35.556
Hi.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.568
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

05:39.540 --> 05:41.030
Everything okay
with your son?

05:41.070 --> 05:42.537
Actually, it wasn't Zach.

05:42.570 --> 05:45.368
He's a family friend
who got into some trouble.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.571
Legal trouble, or my parents
don't understand me trouble?

05:47.610 --> 05:49.578
I'm not quite sure yet.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.669
I was hoping

05:51.710 --> 05:53.109
ifI could drive him home.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.489
I know. I will make up the time.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.787
Thanks.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.857
So did you not go to school
today because of this?

06:06.900 --> 06:08.993
I haven't been going.

06:09.030 --> 06:11.021
Probably do the GED thing later.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.129
What, you mean
you dropped out?

06:13.170 --> 06:15.593
About six months ago.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.369
You guys had already
moved by then.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.179
I remember you being
way cooler than this.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.178
Oh, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.508
And I don't get
why you can't help me

06:25.550 --> 06:26.869
without getting them involved.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.114
It's out of respect, Kenny.

06:28.150 --> 06:29.481
You still live with them.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.044
You and I owe them that much.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.614
You don't owe them anything.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.013
They blew you off.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.152
That's who they are.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.494
All right, you
ready to do this?

06:44.530 --> 06:47.499
I was kind of hoping
you'd go in first.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.077
You're lucky I remember
what a cute kid you were.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.049
YOUNG KENNY:
Mom.

07:06.150 --> 07:07.458
Mom, Mom.

07:07.490 --> 07:09.526
Kenny honey, Mommy's busy.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.925
I'm just saying,

07:10.960 --> 07:13.793
somebody else has to start
hosting these things.

07:13.830 --> 07:15.889
Oh, please, you
love doing this.

07:15.930 --> 07:17.921
Maybe. But I couldn't do it

07:17.970 --> 07:19.665
without you.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.807
(doorbell ringing)

07:27.540 --> 07:28.677
Hi, Lauren.

07:28.710 --> 07:30.746
Hi.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.611
What are you--

07:32.650 --> 07:34.072
what are you doing?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.179
You look... great.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.619
You know, I've been meaning
to call...

07:39.660 --> 07:41.059
I'm sorry to just
show up like this,

07:41.090 --> 07:43.650
but I need to talk to you
about Kenny.

07:44.690 --> 07:46.829
LAUREN:
Where is he?

07:46.860 --> 07:48.657
My car.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.520
Asked me to smooth the waters.

07:50.570 --> 07:53.630
You didn't have to drive
all the way out here.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.638
You could've called.

07:55.670 --> 07:58.639
I could've.

07:58.670 --> 08:01.707
But a boy I saw grow up
asked for my help.

08:01.740 --> 08:04.538
And his mother used
to be a friend.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.543
You need to come outside.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.582
(phone ringing)

08:10.950 --> 08:11.939
Hello?

08:11.990 --> 08:13.685
He is wanted by the police.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.085
What? Who?

08:15.120 --> 08:17.179
Kenny. But not for buying pot.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.754
Oh, my God!

08:18.790 --> 08:19.950
Where are you taking him?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.251
Ow! You're hurting me!

08:21.300 --> 08:22.927
What's he being charged with?

08:22.970 --> 08:23.789
Who the hell are you?

08:23.830 --> 08:25.263
His attorney.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.221
Felony murder.

08:31.670 --> 08:35.629
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

08:46.320 --> 08:48.015
ALICIA:
They're saying Kenny
did this?
KALINDA: Yep.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.927
Along with Brian Keller.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.849
The police allege that
these two broke into
a guest apartment

08:53.900 --> 08:55.891
owned by the
Rankin family.
They broke in?

08:55.930 --> 08:57.227
Nothing was
reported stolen,

08:57.270 --> 08:58.589
but the police
have Kenny

08:58.630 --> 09:00.029
and Brian's fingerprints
on a window

09:00.070 --> 09:01.196
that was jammed open.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.561
Kenny said he was at a friend's.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.261
Yeah, that would be the Rankin's
17-year-old son, Spencer.

09:06.310 --> 09:08.699
He lives above the garage,
but obviously wasn't home

09:08.740 --> 09:10.173
at the time.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.700
And because the guard

09:11.750 --> 09:13.911
was killed in the commission
of an alleged burglary,

09:13.950 --> 09:15.315
it's felony murder.

09:15.350 --> 09:17.318
Yep. The police
theorize

09:17.350 --> 09:19.318
that the boys encountered
a security guard

09:19.350 --> 09:21.318
as they were leaving,
struggled with him,

09:21.360 --> 09:22.827
then shoved him down
the stairs,

09:22.860 --> 09:24.350
where he hit his head
on concrete.

09:24.390 --> 09:27.791
He died at approximately
11:20 pm.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.195
according to the
medical examiner.

09:29.230 --> 09:31.892
Kenny isn't capable
of doing this.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.363
Well, how well
do you know him?
Very.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.368
His mother was my first friend
in Highland Park.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.209
Oh, yeah?

09:37.240 --> 09:40.232
Well, and the first person
to stop talking to me.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.876
You getting me out?

09:48.920 --> 09:49.739
Not yet.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.246
I just came by to see
how you're doing.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.110
I didn't know anybody died,

09:53.160 --> 09:54.616
I don't know how
anybody could have.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.355
We probably shouldn't talk
in here.

09:56.390 --> 09:58.187
Like, I told you, I ran home.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.891
I yelled up at Brian to get out,

09:59.930 --> 10:01.795
but he couldn't hear me,
he was still inside.

10:01.830 --> 10:03.764
The police are saying...
I never even

10:03.800 --> 10:05.722
saw the guard, just his car!

10:05.770 --> 10:08.261
Then why did you lie to me,
Kenny?

10:08.300 --> 10:10.302
Why didn't you tell me
you broke in?

10:10.340 --> 10:12.638
Because we didn't.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.977
Okay.

10:16.010 --> 10:18.979
Look, there'll-there'll
be a bail hearing,

10:19.010 --> 10:20.648
and a judge will decide

10:20.680 --> 10:22.147
if you can be released
pending trial.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.886
Talk to Spencer.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.909
He's my friend.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.383
He knew we were coming.

10:26.420 --> 10:28.012
He said to take whatever
we needed,

10:28.060 --> 10:29.687
he even told us
where the spare key was--

10:29.730 --> 10:32.051
we just-- we couldn't find it
so we pushed a window open.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.853
Mrs. Florrick,

10:33.900 --> 10:36.118
I swear... I ran

10:36.160 --> 10:38.424
home when I saw
the guard's car.

10:38.470 --> 10:40.290
Okay.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.331
WILL:
Not the strongest case.

10:42.370 --> 10:44.759
DIANE:
But she's signing
a client.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.402
And if his parents live
in Highland Park,

10:46.440 --> 10:48.431
payment won't
be an issue.
I don't know.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.347
When the_connections_ are
personal, It can get trlclq.

10:51.380 --> 10:53.268
DIANE:
Blurring the line
between friendship

10:53.320 --> 10:54.878
and business usually is.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.376
Um, actually,

10:56.420 --> 10:57.978
I don't have a relationship

10:58.020 --> 10:59.339
with his parents anymore,
which is why

10:59.390 --> 11:01.085
I would prefer someone else

11:01.120 --> 11:02.417
be the attorney of record.
I don't understand.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.758
If you're no longer friends,
why do this at all?

11:04.790 --> 11:07.122
Because my relationship
with his parents

11:07.160 --> 11:08.320
has nothing to do
with how I feel

11:08.360 --> 11:09.327
about their son.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.918
I used to baby-sit him.

11:10.970 --> 11:14.235
I'll do all the briefs,
all the legwork.

11:14.270 --> 11:15.396
I would just feel
more comfortable

11:15.440 --> 11:16.805
if someone else tried the case.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.398
So, you sign your
first client,

11:18.440 --> 11:19.839
but you want
a second associate

11:19.880 --> 11:21.302
to be the face of the case.

11:22.310 --> 11:23.971
Give herself a bridge.
I get that.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.818
Richard, I...

11:35.860 --> 11:37.885
You want to explain to me
why the attorney I hired

11:37.930 --> 11:39.249
for my son
just got turned away?

11:39.290 --> 11:41.349
Didn't Lauren tell you?

11:41.400 --> 11:43.129
I was there...
Terry StreIger.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.297
And excuse me for saying
so, Mrs. Florrick,

11:45.330 --> 11:47.867
but I think you're
in over your head.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.299
Terry's been
a defense attorney

11:49.340 --> 11:50.830
for more than 20 years.

11:50.870 --> 11:53.100
He's a top-rated ABA member,

11:53.140 --> 11:55.802
he's well-known
and well-respected.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.400
So, thank you for your time,
but we'll take it from here.

11:58.450 --> 11:59.508
Okay?

11:59.550 --> 12:01.768
Your son asked_ me
to represent him.

12:01.820 --> 12:03.219
Without our consent.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.741
He doesn't need
your consent, he's 18.

12:05.790 --> 12:06.757
And how do you think
he's going to pay for it?

12:06.790 --> 12:08.189
I don't know.

12:08.220 --> 12:09.357
We'll work something out.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.288
And although I might
not be as seasoned

12:10.330 --> 12:13.049
as Mr. Streiger is,
I can guarantee you

12:13.100 --> 12:15.227
I care a lot more
about your son than he does.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.367
Kenny will get the best defense.

12:25.110 --> 12:26.975
...with my buddies
and I'm bombed.

12:27.010 --> 12:29.331
And my ex-girlfriend,
I hadn't seen her...

12:29.380 --> 12:30.506
What are you doing here?

12:30.550 --> 12:32.142
Excuse me.

12:32.180 --> 12:34.273
Diane said you needed
a first chair.

12:41.020 --> 12:44.148
Kenny, this is
my associate, Cary Agos.

12:44.190 --> 12:48.024
He's one of the best
attorneys with the firm.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.823
He'll be helping me
with your defense.

12:49.870 --> 12:50.996
Good to meet you.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.167
This should be pretty simple.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.861
We get you out on bail
and get you home.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.265
_ BAILIEF: _
Court IS now In sessmn.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.234
The Honorable Earl Hovick
presrdlng.

12:57.270 --> 12:58.362
Ms. Raines.
Your Honor,

12:58.410 --> 13:01.129
clue to the seriousness
of the charges,

13:01.180 --> 13:02.977
the state opposes
bail at this time.

13:03.010 --> 13:04.841
We believe the defendant

13:04.880 --> 13:07.440
not only poses a flight risk
but a danger to the community.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.449
Excuse me, Your Honor,
but based on what?

13:10.490 --> 13:11.548
Mr. Chatham has no
criminal history,

13:11.590 --> 13:13.285
close ties to the community,

13:13.320 --> 13:15.515
in fact, his parents are
seated in the gallery here

13:15.560 --> 13:19.326
to assure the court that_
their son wnll appear for trIal.

13:19.360 --> 13:22.056
Begging your pardon, Your Honor,
but the State has secured

13:22.100 --> 13:24.989
a cooperating witness,
co-defendant Brian Keller.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.497
Who not only places Mr. Chatham

13:26.530 --> 13:27.838
at the crime scene

13:27.870 --> 13:30.430
but identifies him
as the attacker.

13:30.470 --> 13:31.505
JUDGE HOVICK:
Then bail is denied.

13:31.540 --> 13:33.508
Defendant is remanded
to custody.

13:33.540 --> 13:36.532
(bangs gavel)
Next case.

13:36.580 --> 13:37.808
You told me_ it was
gonna be srmple.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.410
Your friend Brian must've cut a
deal with the State's Attorney.

13:40.450 --> 13:41.542
CARY:
The first one

13:41.580 --> 13:43.514
who does is
usually the fIrst one out.

13:43.550 --> 13:45.017
Let's go.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.895
I need to talk to you
guys about something.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.259
That sounds serious.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.369
It is, actually.

14:05.410 --> 14:06.604
Is it about Dad?

14:06.640 --> 14:08.437
Oh, no, no, no, no, he's fine.

14:08.480 --> 14:13.372
I just would rather
you hear this from me.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.614
Kenny Chatham got arrested.

14:14.650 --> 14:16.117
For murder, right?

14:16.150 --> 14:17.583
Yeah, and you're like
one of his lawyers.

14:17.620 --> 14:19.611
That's what Janna told me.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.958
Yeah, Shane IM'd me about it.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.185
Everyone's totally freaked.

14:23.230 --> 14:26.028
Uh, well, are there any
questions you'd like to ask me?

14:26.060 --> 14:27.596
Or do you want to talk
about any of it at all?

14:27.630 --> 14:29.257
Not really.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.927
Been hearing about it
all night as it is.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.289
Yeah, it's really all

14:32.330 --> 14:33.536
anybody back there
is taking about.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.367
I'm sure.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.664
And it must be pretty
upsetting to you guys, too.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.372
Mom, we only ever
saw Kenny 'cause he was

14:40.410 --> 14:41.570
your friend's son.

14:41.610 --> 14:43.407
We have our own friends
back in Highland Park.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.678
At least on Facebook.

14:44.710 --> 14:47.417
Since we're not allowed
to go back.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.585
That's not true.

14:54.990 --> 14:57.288
I'm done.
Can I be excused?

14:57.330 --> 15:00.595
I guess.
Me, too.

15:00.630 --> 15:03.929
By the way, I didn't
make the soccer team.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.570
You're here early.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.588
Ah, but not the first.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.080
That's what happens

15:27.120 --> 15:29.315
when you're single
and childless.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.328
(chuckling)
I was going to
leave you a note.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.554
I wanted to see how
things were gomg

15:32.590 --> 15:33.989
with him as first chair.

15:34.030 --> 15:35.520
Well, he's certainly confident.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.527
(chuckles)

15:36.560 --> 15:38.266
Look, this is your case.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.392
Diane assumed,

15:39.430 --> 15:41.569
rightly so, that you were just
looking for a front man

15:41.600 --> 15:42.532
to provide a little cushion

15:42.570 --> 15:44.106
since you're dealing
with friends.
Former.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.665
Sounds complicated.
It is.

15:46.710 --> 15:49.634
Legally or emotionally?

15:49.680 --> 15:50.840
Both.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.610
We didn't get bail because
Brian cut a deal with the SA.

15:53.650 --> 15:55.379
He got immunity
on felony murder

15:55.420 --> 15:57.581
by taking a lesser
charge of burglary

15:57.620 --> 16:00.157
and agreeing to testify
against Kenny.

16:00.190 --> 16:01.714
So what we need to do is...

16:01.760 --> 16:03.728
Establish there was
no burglary.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.422
KALINDA:
So, I'll dig up what I can
on this Brian character.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.358
Yeah, and we'll question

16:07.400 --> 16:09.425
Spencer Rankin,
hopefully get him to agree

16:09.460 --> 16:11.098
to testify for
the defense, right?

16:11.130 --> 16:12.563
Right.

16:12.600 --> 16:13.635
These kids go to
a fancy campus.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.695
GRACE:
Mom, I don't like it.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.231
Grace, this is the best
school in the county.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.669
You just give it some time.

16:19.710 --> 16:20.677
I think you're gonna
love it here.

16:20.710 --> 16:23.042
(car horn honking)

16:23.080 --> 16:24.240
Reminds me of my
old high school.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.508
Reminds me of the schools

16:25.550 --> 16:26.744
I used to vandalize.

16:34.090 --> 16:35.489
Spencer?

16:35.520 --> 16:37.784
My name is Mrs. Florrick.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.594
We'd like to talk to you about
what happened at your apartment.

16:40.630 --> 16:41.597
You guys are cops?

16:41.630 --> 16:45.066
No, we're just trying
to help your friends.

16:49.170 --> 16:51.365
Hey, hey, hey, don't let
Mom make you nervous.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.399
What's up, man?
I'm Cary. How you doing?

16:52.440 --> 16:54.237
Look, that's a pretty
sweet situation you got

16:54.280 --> 16:55.531
by your folks' garage, dude.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.047
That's kind of like having
your own place, huh?

16:57.080 --> 16:59.048
I don't know anything
about what happened.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.479
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, no, no, it's cool.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.147
I get it, I guess, I don't
I guess I'm just envious.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.408
'Cause I keep thinking
about what I would've done

17:03.450 --> 17:04.747
if I'd had a place like that.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.610
You know, hell, what I would do
now if I had a place like that.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.550
I mean, I'm sure
you and Kenny had some

17:08.590 --> 17:10.057
seriously sick times
up there, right?

17:10.090 --> 17:12.251
I guess.
Yeah.

17:12.290 --> 17:14.554
They're not gonna happen anymore
though, are they? You know why?

17:14.600 --> 17:16.750
Because the cops are saying
Kenny broke into your place.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.665
And you know why
they're saying that?

17:18.700 --> 17:20.793
Because they don't get how good
of a friend you are to him.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.489
They don't get what
you and he share.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.758
They don't get you told him
it was okay to help himself

17:24.810 --> 17:27.108
to your weed that night.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.176
Yeah, and because of that

17:29.210 --> 17:31.269
the Ken-ster's facing
life in prison.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.412
So, what do you
need me to do?

17:39.650 --> 17:42.756
We tell the SA. we got a
witness corroborating permission

17:42.790 --> 17:44.587
and we cut Kenny's
jail time by 10 years.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.222
He shouldn't have
to do any jail time.

17:46.260 --> 17:48.797
Without the burglary charge,
he can't be held accountable

17:48.830 --> 17:50.491
for what happened after
he left a crime scene.

17:50.530 --> 17:52.669
You're assuming a jury won't
believe Brian's version more.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.236
Kenny has no alibi.

17:54.270 --> 17:55.294
His parents were asleep
when he got home.

17:55.340 --> 17:58.229
Okay, so this Brian,
he's got a temper.

17:58.270 --> 17:59.635
Then we need to find a witness

17:59.670 --> 18:01.376
who can place him
at or near his home.

18:01.410 --> 18:03.207
And if there aren't any?
It's too risky.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.376
Guidance counselor says

18:04.410 --> 18:06.469
he's been suspended
twice for fighting.

18:06.510 --> 18:08.512
Kenny, however, was always
seen as a sweet kid

18:08.550 --> 18:10.381
till he started hanging
out with Brian, that is.

18:10.420 --> 18:11.819
Pretty toxic friendship.

18:11.850 --> 18:13.283
Don't you think
we should at least

18:13.320 --> 18:14.753
investigate the situation?

18:14.790 --> 18:17.850
(sighs)
Timeline's too mushy
for reasonable doubt.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.552
If we go to court and he's
found guilty, it's 20 to life.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.727
We should be fighting
for total exoneration.

18:22.760 --> 18:23.692
He's innocent.

18:23.730 --> 18:26.096
But can we prove it?

18:32.740 --> 18:34.469
ZACH:
Bet the bus is already here.

18:34.510 --> 18:35.807
Yeah, well, maybe if you
didn't hog the shower...

18:35.840 --> 18:37.398
Just keep moving, guys.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.372
Mrs. Chatham?

18:40.420 --> 18:43.912
Oh, my God, look
at both of you.

18:43.950 --> 18:47.181
Hey.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.687
Hey.

18:48.720 --> 18:52.622
Okay, guys, come on,
let's get going.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.691
Did you want to come in?

19:07.840 --> 19:09.273
I heard you'd moved.

19:09.310 --> 19:11.801
Wasn't easy tracking down
an address.

19:11.850 --> 19:14.739
It's a nice apartment.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.179
La_uren.
Ijust...

19:17.920 --> 19:19.888
I want to know what's
happening with the case.

19:21.890 --> 19:25.485
Right now, we're looking for
someone who can place Kenny

19:25.530 --> 19:27.851
at or near your house
the night of the murder.

19:27.900 --> 19:31.222
To prove he couldn't
have done it.

19:33.870 --> 19:34.962
I talked to Richard.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.436
We'll pay Kenny's legal fees.

19:39.940 --> 19:43.603
Wasn't easy getting him
to budge.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.505
I'm sure you remember how
controlling he can be.

19:46.550 --> 19:48.438
How are things between you?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.187
The same.

19:53.590 --> 19:57.959
RICHARD:
I go to get a drink, right,
by the time I get back,

19:57.990 --> 20:01.790
Alicia has the governor
literally backed into a corner,

20:01.830 --> 20:04.628
nailing him on his lack of
support for the arts.

20:04.670 --> 20:07.639
I was just asking him
to explain his position.

20:07.670 --> 20:09.831
(Richard and Alicia laughing)

20:09.870 --> 20:11.929
(crying)

20:14.710 --> 20:16.837
(sobbing)

20:29.020 --> 20:31.022
There she is.

20:31.060 --> 20:32.925
What's a nice girl like you
doing at a place

20:32.960 --> 20:34.825
like the State's Attorney's
office anyway?

20:34.860 --> 20:36.851
Best place to practice law.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.026
Oh, I don't know about that.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.436
Life at a private
firm has its perks.

20:40.470 --> 20:42.495
I became an ASA because
I like duking it out

20:42.540 --> 20:44.599
in court, not over lunch.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.279
Oh, that's too bad,
because that's what
I was about to suggest.

20:47.310 --> 20:48.379
Talked to my bosses.

20:48.410 --> 20:50.469
We're on board with a plea
bargain in the Chatham case.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.704
Really?
Yeah.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.469
So, Thai, Italian or should
we just grab a couple steaks?

20:54.520 --> 20:55.441
KALIN DA:
Where's Cary?

20:55.480 --> 20:58.278
Shouldn't he be out here
canvassmg as well?

20:58.320 --> 21:01.448
Well, he said he had
to do something else.

21:01.490 --> 21:03.526
There's plenty of
street lighting.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.949
Clear shot from the house
across the street.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.753
Maybe the one on the right, too.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.688
In this neighborhood,
Kenny running home

21:09.730 --> 21:12.665
after 11:00 would have
definitely been noticed.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.332
Think they've got enough
manicured lawns here?

21:17.370 --> 21:20.498
Grass can't be more
than two inches tall.

21:20.540 --> 21:23.668
Neighborhood association
wields a mighty sword.

21:23.710 --> 21:24.779
Pretty.

21:24.810 --> 21:27.574
Doesn't seem like a good fit
though-- you living here.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.917
Was it?

21:28.950 --> 21:32.408
I did it for 10 years,
I liked it at the time.

21:32.450 --> 21:33.986
Ignorance is bliss, I guess.

21:34.020 --> 21:37.421
Let's see what Kenny's
neighbors have to say?

21:37.460 --> 21:39.553
(doorbell ringing)

21:39.590 --> 21:41.455
WOMAN:
Everyone's pretty shaken up.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.491
I mean, this sort of thing
just doesn't happen around here.

21:43.530 --> 21:45.498
Scandal maybe,
but murder?

21:46.770 --> 21:48.738
Were you on duty

21:48.770 --> 21:51.364
when it happened?
You tell me.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.968
I work second shift,
2:00 to 11:00 PM.

21:53.010 --> 21:54.671
Not that I ever
get out on time.

21:54.710 --> 21:55.972
My relief's always late.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.568
What time did you leave exactly?

21:57.610 --> 22:00.443
Don't know off the top
of my head,

22:00.480 --> 22:02.414
but I could check my time card.

22:02.450 --> 22:03.587
Got a copy of it somewhere.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.882
And, Shelly,
when you were leaving,

22:04.920 --> 22:06.615
do you remember seeing anyone
on the street?

22:06.650 --> 22:07.856
Anyone running?

22:07.890 --> 22:09.016
Not really.

22:09.060 --> 22:11.927
I mean I_ think I saw someone
go InSIde across the way.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.552
You mean through the front door?

22:13.600 --> 22:14.658
Yeah,

22:14.700 --> 22:15.792
because they turned
the yard lights

22:15.830 --> 22:18.663
off right after-- made it hard
to fill out my timecard.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.839
And was this person male
or female?

22:20.870 --> 22:22.565
Sorry, didn't get
that good a look.

22:26.570 --> 22:27.264
Hello.

22:27.310 --> 22:29.904
Your husband's
doing a fine job.

22:29.940 --> 22:31.601
Don't mind her.

22:31.650 --> 22:32.844
She has dementia.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.541
Only remembers
the past.

22:34.580 --> 22:36.468
Here it is.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.715
11:25. That help?

22:38.750 --> 22:41.685
You have no physical

22:41.720 --> 22:43.620
evidence linking my client
to the victim.

22:43.660 --> 22:45.628
No DNA, nothing.
Even so,

22:45.660 --> 22:48.720
you can't prove he wasn't an
accomplice to the burglary.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.489
And if someone_dies
during the C0mmISSl0n,

22:50.530 --> 22:53.829
it's felony murder regardless
of who killed him.

22:53.870 --> 22:55.531
Yeah, except your
witness, Brian,

22:55.570 --> 22:58.539
made a deal-- by copping
to burglary,

22:58.570 --> 23:00.538
he gets immunity
from felony murder charges,

23:00.580 --> 23:01.831
which means he has
Incentive to he.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.643
Fine.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.447
Second-degree murder.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.448
Four to 15?

23:08.480 --> 23:09.071
Mm-hmm.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.088
No, I don't think so.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.542
We'll do involuntary
manslaughter.

23:12.590 --> 23:13.750
Can I get some more,
uh, water, please.

23:13.790 --> 23:15.155
Not going to happen.

23:15.190 --> 23:16.179
Can I try a fry?

23:16.220 --> 23:18.825
Yeah, help yourself.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.124
Well, manslaughter,
since

23:21.160 --> 23:22.650
burglary's not in play anymore.

23:22.700 --> 23:23.598
What?

23:23.630 --> 23:25.598
(chuckles)

23:25.630 --> 23:26.927
Uh, did I forget to mention

23:26.970 --> 23:28.699
that we can prove Kenny had
permission to enter?

23:29.840 --> 23:31.933
Spencer Rankin's
willing to testify.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.877
So, as I was saying...

23:34.910 --> 23:36.138
A man's still dead.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.639
I'll make a case to the judge

23:44.690 --> 23:46.681
for a maximum sentence
of ﬁve years.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.585
Make it two and we got a deal.

23:53.660 --> 23:56.458
These rich kids really do
get away with murder.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.797
The crime scene is about

23:58.830 --> 24:01.594
half a mile west of here.

24:01.640 --> 24:04.029
Security guard called
into operations

24:04.070 --> 24:05.662
at 11:15

24:05.710 --> 24:08.099
to say he was doing
a perimeter check.

24:08.140 --> 24:09.801
He was dead by 11:20.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.501
The prosecution
would argue

24:11.550 --> 24:13.518
that Kenny still had time
to attack the guard

24:13.550 --> 24:16.519
and get home on foot
by 11:25.

24:16.550 --> 24:17.710
Is that even possible?

24:17.750 --> 24:19.809
Run that distance
in five minutes?

24:19.850 --> 24:22.057
Only one way
to find out.

24:22.090 --> 24:25.628
The average teenage boy
sprinting would likely be

24:25.660 --> 24:27.651
in the range of eight
to ten miles per hour.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.759
How do you even know that?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.768
Would you believe me

24:31.800 --> 24:34.098
if I told you I was a track
coach in a previous life?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.630
No.

24:35.670 --> 24:37.638
Okay.

24:37.670 --> 24:40.207
Okay, it's two minutes
and we're...

24:40.240 --> 24:42.276
(car honking)

24:42.310 --> 24:43.538
Ass!

24:44.580 --> 24:46.548
Nice. Nice.

24:46.580 --> 24:47.842
You oughta try it
sometime.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.518
What, flipping
someone off?

24:49.550 --> 24:50.847
It's good
for your soul.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.188
(laughs)

24:54.660 --> 24:57.220
ALICIA:
So, from Kenny's house
to Spencer's...

24:57.260 --> 24:58.750
Just under five minutes.

24:58.790 --> 24:59.779
It's pretty tight,

24:59.830 --> 25:01.559
but the prosecution's right--

25:01.600 --> 25:02.999
it's doable.

25:03.030 --> 25:04.691
In other words, the
nurse's testimony

25:04.730 --> 25:06.789
will only go
so far.
Yeah.

25:12.870 --> 25:14.201
(camera shutter clicking)

25:14.240 --> 25:15.673
Guess there's no chance the SA.

25:15.710 --> 25:16.904
_ will let us_in_
WIthout permISSIon.

25:16.940 --> 25:18.749
I don't exactly have
a good relationship

25:18.780 --> 25:20.543
with that department
anymore.

25:20.580 --> 25:21.569
You come

25:21.620 --> 25:22.848
within 100 feet of my son again,

25:22.880 --> 25:24.108
and I swear, I'll sue you,

25:24.150 --> 25:26.584
the Chathams,
and your entire firm.

25:26.620 --> 25:27.757
Spencer's got

25:27.790 --> 25:29.189
nothing to do with this
and how dare you

25:29.220 --> 25:32.189
intimidate him into giving
false information.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.891
There was never any permission
given to enter,

25:33.930 --> 25:36.649
there was never any pot
and he is

25:36.700 --> 25:39.294
never going to testify!

25:41.700 --> 25:43.634
I had the plea in my hand.

25:43.670 --> 25:45.934
And I had no idea you went
to the State's Attorney.

25:45.970 --> 25:47.574
I told you what the plan was.

25:47.610 --> 25:49.305
But I never agreed to it, Cary,

25:49.340 --> 25:50.648
and we never
presented It...

25:50.680 --> 25:51.874
I cleared it through Diane.

25:53.210 --> 25:55.019
All right?

25:56.720 --> 25:58.847
And now we've
got nothIng.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.859
No, we have an eyewitness

26:01.890 --> 26:03.949
who'll testify that at 11:19

26:03.990 --> 26:05.958
she saw...
A figure from a distance.

26:05.990 --> 26:07.082
And the ASA

26:07.130 --> 26:09.121
has an eyewitness who will
positively identify Kenny

26:09.160 --> 26:10.149
as the killer.

26:11.730 --> 26:12.765
We don't have a case.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.735
And they don't have conclusive
physical evidence.

26:15.770 --> 26:17.738
I gotta go.

26:17.770 --> 26:20.603
I gotta prep
for court.

26:21.910 --> 26:24.174
You realize Cary's never been
to trial before.

26:24.210 --> 26:26.747
How is that even possible?

26:26.780 --> 26:27.849
Easy.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.916
By pleading out every court case
that comes your way.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.352
_ _ JUDGE: _
ThIs Is a pre-trIal hearIng.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.823
Which is another way of saying

26:40.860 --> 26:42.725
both sides should come
to an agreement

26:42.760 --> 26:43.920
before we go any farther.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.768
I guess my parents
aren't coming.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.835
But since you haven't yet--

26:47.870 --> 26:51.101
be advised there is no jury
in this proceeding,

26:51.140 --> 26:52.266
there's just me.

26:52.310 --> 26:54.130
And my determination

26:54.180 --> 26:56.671
as to whether or not there's
enough probable cause

26:56.710 --> 27:00.840
to hold this defendant
for a long, expenSIve trIal.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.916
They're probably
on their way.

27:02.950 --> 27:04.747
And because this is
all about me,

27:04.790 --> 27:06.883
I get to ask questions, too.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.353
Particularly
if our esteemed attorneys

27:08.390 --> 27:11.826
don't ask the right ones.

27:11.860 --> 27:13.657
Ms. Raines, you're up.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.418
At 11:24 p.m.,

27:17.460 --> 27:19.325
Brian was pulled
over for speeding,

27:19.370 --> 27:21.361
approximately four blocks
from the Rankin house.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.801
And Officer Diaz,
did Brian give any statement

27:24.840 --> 27:26.364
at that time?
Yes, he did.

27:26.410 --> 27:28.002
He immediately confessed
to having fled

27:28.040 --> 27:29.871
the scene of a burglary
on Belson Street.

27:29.910 --> 27:31.172
So, in effect,

27:31.210 --> 27:33.201
he placed himself
at the crime scene.

27:33.250 --> 27:33.909
Yes,

27:33.950 --> 27:35.838
and was arrested at that time.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.212
In your experience,
do spontaneous

27:38.250 --> 27:40.787
confessions such as this
tend to be accurate?

27:40.820 --> 27:43.152
DIAZ:
Typically, the perpetrator
won't have had enough time

27:43.190 --> 27:44.987
to concoct a story,
so, yes.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.281
They usually are.

27:46.330 --> 27:47.922
Nothing further.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.758
Mr. Agos...

27:55.970 --> 27:57.961
Officer Diaz.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.041
Sorry, I need to refer
back to my notes.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.978
(sighs)

28:10.180 --> 28:11.886
Yeah, yeah, I
know, I know.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.785
I know.

28:13.820 --> 28:16.983
Sometime before I go gray,
Counsel.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.124
Officer Diaz,

28:21.160 --> 28:22.923
when Mr. Keller had

28:22.960 --> 28:23.858
this "spontaneous utterance",

28:23.900 --> 28:25.322
did he mention that anyone
had been killed?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.964
Not until after we got
to the station, no.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.389
So, when Brian
told you that

28:30.440 --> 28:32.237
Kenny Chatham was responsible
for the victim's death,

28:32.270 --> 28:33.259
he had had

28:33.310 --> 28:34.902
time to concoct
a story.

28:34.940 --> 28:36.771
Objection.
Sustained.

28:36.810 --> 28:40.405
If for no other reason than
the use of pluperfect tense.

28:43.450 --> 28:45.441
Nothing further.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.452
It gets easier as you go.

28:51.490 --> 28:54.891
My interests have never
been in litigation.

28:57.130 --> 29:00.099
Prosecution calls Brian Keller.

29:00.130 --> 29:03.236
Brian, tell us what
happened that night.

29:03.270 --> 29:04.305
Kenny wanted to get high

29:04.340 --> 29:06.103
and he said he knew where
he could get some weed.

29:06.140 --> 29:08.108
He never said anything
about breaking in, though,

29:08.140 --> 29:09.277
which is why
I was surprised

29:09.310 --> 29:11.039
when he asked me to help
jam the window open.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.968
I mean,
I did it, but...

29:13.010 --> 29:14.546
I was kinda freaked out
afterward.

29:14.580 --> 29:15.774
So I went downstairs.

29:15.820 --> 29:16.775
And did what?

29:16.820 --> 29:17.912
To wait for him

29:17.950 --> 29:20.009
so we could get the
heck out of there.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.051
But then I saw
the security guard.

29:21.090 --> 29:22.910
Did he see you?

29:22.960 --> 29:25.155
No, I hid behind a bush.

29:25.190 --> 29:27.055
Right in there.

29:27.090 --> 29:29.524
I know this is difficult,
but could you

29:29.560 --> 29:30.891
tell the judge
what you saw?

29:30.930 --> 29:33.228
I can't believe
he could lie like this.

29:33.270 --> 29:34.897
People do it all the time.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.103
Um... I saw
the guard go up the stairs.

29:38.140 --> 29:39.562
Here?

29:39.610 --> 29:42.306
Yeah and I guess he kinda
surprised Kenny because

29:42.340 --> 29:44.001
they kinda got into it,

29:44.050 --> 29:45.904
and Kenny sorta
shoved him,

29:45.950 --> 29:47.941
and the guard fell
backwards.

29:47.980 --> 29:49.072
And he just...

29:49.120 --> 29:50.849
just stopped moving.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.484
Then Kenny just
took off.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.317
What's the matter?

29:55.360 --> 29:56.850
Nothing.

29:56.890 --> 29:58.448
Just manicured lawns.

29:58.490 --> 29:59.582
So from where you
were standing,

29:59.630 --> 30:02.019
you had a clear view
of the crime.

30:02.060 --> 30:04.096
Yes.

30:04.130 --> 30:06.121
No further questions.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.060
That's plenty for today.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.999
Court's adjourned
till 9:00 tomorrow.

30:14.040 --> 30:16.008
(pounds gavel)

30:16.040 --> 30:18.144
Heads up.

30:18.180 --> 30:19.977
You guys want to go
for a ride?

30:20.010 --> 30:21.079
Where to?

30:21.120 --> 30:23.008
I don't know.
See some old friends?

30:24.050 --> 30:25.586
Hey, um, I gotta go.

30:25.620 --> 30:27.815
I'll talk to you
later, okay?
Mom? Highland park?

30:37.660 --> 30:40.629
Didn't think anyone
was still here.

30:40.670 --> 30:43.867
Just prepping for court.

30:45.140 --> 30:47.131
By reading
case law, huh?

30:47.170 --> 30:49.138
You're better off

30:49.180 --> 30:51.045
watching experienced
trial lavwers.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.048
Yeah, well, new kid
on the block.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.139
I don't get much opportunity
to shadow seniors.

30:55.180 --> 30:56.545
(chuckles)

30:56.580 --> 30:59.378
Though I have learned a lot
by watching Alicia.

30:59.420 --> 31:01.183
She's definitely got
some serious skills.

31:01.220 --> 31:04.053
We suspect
it's a Georgetown thing.

31:04.090 --> 31:05.250
No doubt.

31:05.290 --> 31:06.279
No doubt.

31:06.330 --> 31:07.957
(chuckling)

31:08.000 --> 31:10.025
Yeah, that's a long time
to stay friends

31:10.060 --> 31:11.095
since college and all.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.358
So, it's really
commendable--

31:12.400 --> 31:14.129
you championing her
the way that you do.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.129
Yeah, know what's great
about someone like Alicia?

31:18.170 --> 31:20.309
She's a natural.

31:20.340 --> 31:22.331
She doesn't have to try so hard.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.077
Have a good night.

31:48.070 --> 31:50.038
Would you like a drink?

31:50.070 --> 31:52.061
No, thanks.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.036
Where are your kids?

31:56.080 --> 31:57.945
I dropped them at
their friends'.

31:57.980 --> 31:59.208
They really
miss it here.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.218
How bad?

32:01.250 --> 32:02.569
I noticed

32:02.620 --> 32:04.087
you two weren't
in court today.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.587
I came by to give
you an update.

32:09.090 --> 32:11.149
Lauren couldn't handle it.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.487
She's not like you.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.725
She's not that strong.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.125
She's asleep now.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.128
Took a Valium.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.229
Well, it must
be hard on her--

32:20.270 --> 32:21.339
on both of you--

32:21.370 --> 32:23.691
to see your
son like that.

32:23.740 --> 32:27.437
But it's really important that
at least one of you be there.

32:27.470 --> 32:29.370
So, how did it go?

32:29.410 --> 32:31.401
To be honest, not great.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.599
They have Kenny's

32:32.650 --> 32:33.776
fingerprints at the scene,

32:33.810 --> 32:36.347
and someone who will testify
that he pushed the guard.

32:36.380 --> 32:38.439
You think he's guilty?

32:39.490 --> 32:41.515
No.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.154
Do you?

32:47.130 --> 32:48.757
I don't know who he is anymore.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.621
ALICIA:
Did you have a good time?

32:51.670 --> 32:54.639
Yeah, except I forgot how much
of a whiner Janna was.

32:54.670 --> 32:56.194
I didn't.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.730
Like your friends aren't geeks.

32:57.770 --> 32:59.260
Can we go home now?

32:59.310 --> 33:00.607
I just have
one more stop.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.177
Tell me you're not taking us
to the crime scene.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.144
Seriously?

33:05.180 --> 33:06.147
(laughing):
Awesome.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.111
Looks like
no one's home.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.678
Stay here.

33:38.280 --> 33:41.249
(sprinklers whirring)

33:48.190 --> 33:51.284
Oh, my God.
What happened?

33:51.330 --> 33:53.525
_ Iran into the_ _
neIghborhood aSSOCIatIon.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.152
(laughs)

33:56.100 --> 33:57.294
(engine starting)

33:57.330 --> 33:59.264
CARY:
If you don't mind, I'd like

33:59.300 --> 34:01.268
to review the sequence of events
on the night in question.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.494
(clears throat)

34:02.540 --> 34:03.837
You testified

34:03.870 --> 34:06.338
that while Kenny was upstairs,
you waited down

34:06.370 --> 34:07.234
below, is
that correct?

34:07.270 --> 34:08.237
That's right.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.202
And how long
were you there

34:10.240 --> 34:12.140
before the security
guard arrived?

34:12.180 --> 34:13.169
I don't know.

34:13.210 --> 34:14.575
A few minutes?

34:16.280 --> 34:17.474
According to

34:17.520 --> 34:19.545
patrol records,

34:19.590 --> 34:22.616
he called in
a perimeter check at 11:15.

34:22.660 --> 34:25.527
Do you know what time it
was when you saw the guard?

34:25.560 --> 34:27.551
BRIAN:
A few minutes
after that, I guess?

34:29.200 --> 34:31.225
So, 11:18?

34:31.270 --> 34:34.637
And how long were you there

34:34.670 --> 34:36.297
after you
saw the guard?

34:36.340 --> 34:37.238
Couple minutes.

34:37.270 --> 34:39.409
Which puts us at 11:20.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.600
Your Honor, all this has been

34:40.640 --> 34:42.631
established in a
prIor testImony.

34:47.380 --> 34:48.847
Right, right. My mistake.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.347
Brian,

34:50.380 --> 34:53.213
do you know exactly
what time the defendant

34:53.250 --> 34:54.285
attacked the guard?

34:54.320 --> 34:56.652
Like you just said,
11:20 or so.

34:56.690 --> 34:59.329
And you left
the Rankin house when?

34:59.360 --> 35:02.420
It's already been
stated that he was
arrested at 11:24.

35:02.460 --> 35:04.269
CARY:
So, it was just

35:04.300 --> 35:06.188
four minutes between the time
of the killing

35:06.230 --> 35:07.322
and the time of your arrest?

35:07.370 --> 35:08.439
Yes.

35:08.470 --> 35:09.596
Now that you've dazzled us

35:09.640 --> 35:10.789
with your math skills, Mr. Agos,

35:10.840 --> 35:13.331
can we please move on?

35:14.680 --> 35:16.409
Were you wet?

35:18.510 --> 35:19.579
What do you mean?

35:19.610 --> 35:21.840
The police report
made no mention

35:21.880 --> 35:25.816
of your being wet at the time
of your arrest.

35:25.850 --> 35:27.647
But were you?

35:27.690 --> 35:30.318
Objection. What does the weather
have to do with this?

35:30.360 --> 35:32.225
ALICIA:
Your Honor, I'd
like to introduce

35:32.260 --> 35:33.682
the bylaws of the Highland Park

35:33.730 --> 35:35.595
Neighborhood
Association

35:35.630 --> 35:38.622
into evidence.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.298
Specifically,
page four, paragraph two

35:41.340 --> 35:43.490
regarding the watering
of lawns,

35:43.540 --> 35:45.167
which is only
allowed at night

35:45.210 --> 35:46.859
in an effort to save water.
Your Honor!

35:46.910 --> 35:48.468
ALICIA:
For the record,
the Rankins

35:48.510 --> 35:50.273
were in full obeyance
with said bylaws.

35:50.310 --> 35:52.198
Their automatic
sprInkler system

35:52.250 --> 35:53.274
is set to go off every night

35:53.310 --> 35:54.743
at 11:15

35:54.780 --> 35:56.771
and run for 15 minutes.

35:58.250 --> 35:59.842
If you had been where
you said you were,

35:59.890 --> 36:01.380
you would have gotten soaked.

36:02.620 --> 36:03.689
The truth is,

36:03.720 --> 36:05.483
you weren't standing
behind the bush.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.919
You were standing
over the guard.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.257
Objection!

36:12.330 --> 36:14.332
Nothing further.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.379
That you would pursue a charge
of this magnitude

36:23.410 --> 36:24.570
without a thorough investigation

36:24.610 --> 36:26.544
is unconscionable.
Your Honor...

36:26.580 --> 36:28.309
No direct _
or CIrcumstantIal

36:28.350 --> 36:31.217
evidence linking the
defendant to the murder, no

36:31.250 --> 36:33.741
eyewitness testimony other than
that of a co-defendant who has

36:33.790 --> 36:35.849
a vested interest in the
outcome of the trial.

36:35.890 --> 36:37.812
Your Honor,
if you...
Ms. Raines,

36:37.860 --> 36:39.725
I strongly suggest

36:39.760 --> 36:41.625
you find a way to work
with the defense counsel

36:41.660 --> 36:43.548
to_ find a more
eqUItable solutIon.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.989
There's a place around the
corner, serves deep dish

36:46.030 --> 36:47.588
by the slice.
I'm gonna get some.

36:47.630 --> 36:50.337
By my count,
you got about 20 minutes.

36:58.380 --> 36:59.745
Breaking and entering,

36:59.780 --> 37:01.941
plus possession
of marijuana.

37:01.980 --> 37:03.868
Trespassing and possession.

37:03.920 --> 37:04.909
Are you kidding me?

37:04.950 --> 37:06.383
Look,

37:06.420 --> 37:08.456
you're all but guaranteed
of a manslaughter

37:08.490 --> 37:09.787
conviction against Brian.
If you can't

37:09.820 --> 37:11.481
spin that into a win
with the brass,

37:11.530 --> 37:12.622
you're in the wrong line
of work.

37:15.630 --> 37:18.360
Thank you.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.664
You're quite
the skilled negotiator.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.588
Hey, you did all
the heaw lifting.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.767
Seriously. Well done,
Alicia. Well done.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.801
Thanks, Cary.

37:29.340 --> 37:30.534
No jail time.

37:30.580 --> 37:31.808
Thank you.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.772
Thank you so much.

37:33.810 --> 37:35.573
That's great news. Thank
you. I appreciate it.

37:35.620 --> 37:36.769
Oh, our pleasure.

37:36.820 --> 37:39.414
Kenny just has to perform 1,000
hours of community service.

37:39.450 --> 37:40.644
ALICIA:
And participate in

37:40.690 --> 37:41.759
mandatory drug
counseling.

37:41.790 --> 37:44.827
I'll make sure of it.

37:44.860 --> 37:47.055
So... I can take you
to the court clerk,

37:47.090 --> 37:48.751
see about getting Kenny's
personal effects back,

37:48.800 --> 37:49.926
if you like.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.860
Sure.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.495
Now that this is
over, we should...

37:57.540 --> 37:59.633
I don't know,
maybe have lunch.

37:59.670 --> 38:02.309
Pretend none of
this ever happened.

38:02.340 --> 38:03.830
I'll call you, okay?

38:03.880 --> 38:06.440
You're not going to call.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.414
And we're not going
to have lunch.

38:08.450 --> 38:09.712
And that's okay.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.684
It really is.

38:13.050 --> 38:15.712
Take care.

38:21.360 --> 38:24.693
First plea bargain,
a gin martini.

38:24.730 --> 38:26.721
It's another
Stern, Lockhart tradition.

38:26.770 --> 38:29.830
Thanks, but I think I just
want to go home tonight.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.941
I knew I wasn't the only one
burning the midnight oil.

38:40.980 --> 38:42.516
Cary.

38:42.550 --> 38:44.017
How are you?

38:44.050 --> 38:45.517
Fine. Thanks for asking.

38:45.550 --> 38:46.983
Working on
Sheffrin-Marks?

38:48.420 --> 38:51.059
We win this one, our firm's
in a whole new league.

38:51.090 --> 38:52.421
What's your excuse?

38:52.460 --> 38:54.052
Sorry?

38:54.090 --> 38:56.695
For burning the midnight oil.

38:56.730 --> 38:58.664
Oh. Same as yours.

38:58.700 --> 39:01.533
Just going over the Landers
depo docs for Sheffrin.

39:01.570 --> 39:03.765
Billable hours.

39:05.870 --> 39:08.509
Anyway, I just wanted
to update you on the outcome

39:08.540 --> 39:10.007
ofthe
Chatham case.
Mm.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.645
Turns out, I was able
to push the SA.

39:12.680 --> 39:13.999
into a very favorable
plea bargain.

39:14.050 --> 39:16.678
Excellent.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.711
Okay, well...

39:19.750 --> 39:21.684
you have a good night.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.587
Keep up the good work.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.382
Thanks.

39:26.430 --> 39:28.421
I intend to.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.464
(TV plays quietly
in the background)

39:57.460 --> 40:00.520
Oh. Oh.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.050
Oh.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.421
Uh-oh.

40:04.470 --> 40:07.769
(laughs)

40:07.800 --> 40:09.995
Is that your idea
of a notch under your belt?

40:10.040 --> 40:11.769
Gaughs)
Huh?

40:11.810 --> 40:13.664
You think the
kids heard us?

40:13.710 --> 40:15.871
Kids?

40:15.910 --> 40:16.831
Maybe you.

40:16.880 --> 40:18.029
Oh, funny.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.638
(sighs)

40:19.680 --> 40:21.819
Not too bad for an old
married couple, huh?

40:21.850 --> 40:22.942
Uh-uh.

40:22.980 --> 40:24.174
Huh?

40:24.220 --> 40:25.881
(laughs)

40:25.920 --> 40:27.114
I love you.

40:27.150 --> 40:29.653
I love you, too.

40:29.690 --> 40:31.783
(phone ringing)

40:31.830 --> 40:33.127
Don't.

40:33.160 --> 40:36.152
Might be work.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.725
(sighs)

40:38.770 --> 40:40.761
(sighs)

40:46.970 --> 40:48.164
Peter Florrick.

40:48.210 --> 40:50.201
Yeah.

40:53.580 --> 40:54.808
Okay.

40:54.850 --> 40:56.647
Hold on a second.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.170
Um...
Mm-hmm?

40:58.220 --> 40:59.812
It's an office emergency.

40:59.850 --> 41:01.215
Be one minute.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.808
One minute.
Okay.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.851
MAN (on TV):
Next up on news at 11:00--

41:04.890 --> 41:07.051
a Highland Park teen is charged
with manslaughter

41:07.090 --> 41:09.888
in the killing of...

41:14.100 --> 41:16.261
Hey. It's after 10:00.

41:16.300 --> 41:19.758
What are you doing up so late
on a school night?

41:19.810 --> 41:21.801
Just looking out at the view.

41:23.810 --> 41:25.801
It's nice, isn't it?

41:28.010 --> 41:28.977
It's a cool room.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.614
Smaller than my old one, though.

41:34.120 --> 41:37.055
You know what I was
thinking about today?

41:37.090 --> 41:39.650
How much you hated
your old school

41:39.690 --> 41:41.624
when you first
started there.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.621
Yeah, I kind of did.

41:46.970 --> 41:48.961
Today, I'm sort of
glad we moved.

41:51.970 --> 41:53.904
Me, too.
