00:00.592 --> 00:02.365
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.461 --> 00:03.694
I assume I have the misfortune

00:03.695 --> 00:04.861
of speaking to my mother.

00:05.163 --> 00:06.563
I have come to heal our family.

00:06.564 --> 00:08.829
She'd prefer to place us all in new bodies.

00:08.966 --> 00:10.198
Take the body of a mortal

00:10.200 --> 00:11.500
and all be happy again.

00:11.502 --> 00:13.435
It is time you bring Camille in.

00:13.437 --> 00:15.103
There's no need for this.

00:15.105 --> 00:17.906
My sons have taken quite the liking to you.

00:19.676 --> 00:22.444
Proud werewolves on a witch's leash.

00:22.446 --> 00:24.446
I hope those rings you're
wearing are worth it.

00:24.448 --> 00:26.448
You're gonna like me, Davina Claire,

00:26.450 --> 00:28.216
and I'm gonna let you pretend a while

00:28.218 --> 00:29.885
that you don't already.

00:29.887 --> 00:31.686
When he wakes, he'll make his own decision.

00:31.688 --> 00:35.056
You declared war when
you came after my family.

00:35.058 --> 00:36.658
You don't understand.

00:36.660 --> 00:38.360
Slap them on a witch,

00:38.362 --> 00:39.728
can't do magic as long as they're on.

00:39.730 --> 00:41.796
Kidnapping. Rather unpleasant way

00:41.798 --> 00:43.064
to begin a family reunion.

00:43.066 --> 00:45.533
Well, wait until you see how we end it.

00:51.908 --> 00:56.044
We arrive into this world as innocents,

00:56.046 --> 00:58.079
wide-eyed,

00:58.081 --> 01:00.148
vulnerable.

01:00.150 --> 01:05.053
It is the job of our parents
to nurture and protect us.

01:05.055 --> 01:08.890
Unfortunately, our own
parents failed miserably

01:08.892 --> 01:12.493
at even the most basic of parental tasks,

01:12.495 --> 01:14.729
but we are not beholden to the past

01:14.731 --> 01:17.465
they created for us.

01:17.467 --> 01:21.369
Today, a new future awaits.

01:21.371 --> 01:24.672
Forget your animosity
toward Elijah and myself,

01:24.674 --> 01:28.242
and instead join us against she who truly

01:28.244 --> 01:32.513
deserves your ire... our mother.

01:32.515 --> 01:37.251
Do this, and we will
welcome you with open arms.

01:38.554 --> 01:43.157
But if you continue to oppose us,

01:43.159 --> 01:46.260
a denial of pastries will be
the least of your concerns.

01:46.262 --> 01:48.429
If you all you wanted was my
allegiance against mother dearest,

01:48.431 --> 01:50.431
you should have said so,

01:50.433 --> 01:52.466
save me a night shackled to the wall.

01:52.468 --> 01:54.068
This was Niklaus.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.103
My recommendation was to remove

01:56.105 --> 01:58.806
your limbs one by one until you comply.

01:58.808 --> 02:03.144
Heh. We've... we've no
desire to torture you,

02:03.146 --> 02:07.248
provided you vow to stand beside us

02:07.250 --> 02:08.582
as brothers.

02:08.584 --> 02:10.317
Brothers?

02:10.318 --> 02:12.219
Does that word even apply to us

02:12.221 --> 02:14.488
after all these centuries of betrayal,

02:14.490 --> 02:18.826
and is loyalty to you ever really rewarded?

02:19.228 --> 02:22.930
If so, tell me Niklaus,

02:22.932 --> 02:26.567
where is our sister Rebekah?

02:26.969 --> 02:29.336
She was blindly loyal to
you for a thousand years,

02:29.338 --> 02:34.174
and now nowhere to be found.

02:34.176 --> 02:36.643
Where did our sister go,

02:36.645 --> 02:40.280
and how did she escape
your vile machinations?

02:40.282 --> 02:42.282
Heh.

02:42.284 --> 02:45.185
You think me vile?

02:45.187 --> 02:46.920
Well, what then, do you make

02:46.922 --> 02:48.422
of the one who cursed us?

02:48.424 --> 02:50.490
She was trying to make you mortal again,

02:50.492 --> 02:54.127
and you both refused her.

02:54.129 --> 02:57.764
Only proves how far you've fallen,

02:57.766 --> 03:00.467
but I expect Rebekah will
have a different response

03:00.469 --> 03:02.536
to her proposal.

03:03.972 --> 03:05.305
See, unlike the two of you,

03:05.307 --> 03:07.340
she always did cling to her humanity.

03:07.342 --> 03:08.942
Rebekah's off limits, too.

03:08.944 --> 03:11.812
You pursue her, and you will suffer.

03:11.814 --> 03:14.514
Do not let him goad you, Elijah.

03:14.516 --> 03:16.483
Neither he nor Esther will find Rebekah

03:16.485 --> 03:19.186
unless she wants to be
found, and she does not.

03:19.188 --> 03:22.622
Esther is quite determined.

03:22.624 --> 03:24.357
She's been searching for Rebekah

03:24.359 --> 03:26.293
since the day she returned.

03:34.235 --> 03:37.037
I imagine it's only a matter of time.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:46.347 --> 03:50.717
I enjoy a good bloodletting
as much as anyone,

03:51.419 --> 03:53.853
but our brothers have power,

03:53.855 --> 03:55.421
as well as knowledge of Esther's plans.

03:55.423 --> 03:57.156
We need them alive.

03:57.158 --> 04:00.760
Can you imagine what they
would do to Rebekah, to Hope?

04:00.762 --> 04:03.763
Rebekah has been cloaked by powerful magic.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.201
Focus on the task at hand.

04:08.603 --> 04:10.603
We need to persuade our brothers.

04:10.605 --> 04:12.672
I'm through with persuasion.

04:12.674 --> 04:16.041
Has the earth shifted on its axis,

04:16.043 --> 04:19.411
you needing restraint from me?

04:23.572 --> 04:26.172
It's me. I have the baby,
and we're on the run.

04:26.174 --> 04:27.473
Esther found us.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.675
We're safe for now.

04:28.677 --> 04:30.109
I've lost her bloody starlings,

04:30.111 --> 04:31.310
but I have no idea where to go.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.678
Tell her to head west.

04:32.680 --> 04:33.980
I'll call Hayley.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.181
Do not tell Hayley.

04:35.183 --> 04:36.416
Esther's too smart for that.

04:36.418 --> 04:37.917
The only advantage that we have is that

04:37.919 --> 04:40.019
she thinks the baby died.

04:40.021 --> 04:41.854
Text me with plans.

04:43.090 --> 04:45.124
Go. I'll take care of Kol and Finn.

04:45.126 --> 04:47.827
Splendid, and in your hands, I
assume they'll be dead by nightfall.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.962
I will show restraint.
Hope needs her father.

04:49.964 --> 04:52.832
What she needs, what...

04:52.834 --> 04:56.002
what we need are allies to
help us defeat our mother.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.104
Finn and Kol must be turned to our side.

04:58.106 --> 05:00.806
Without their help, there will
be nowhere left for Hope to run.

05:00.808 --> 05:02.008
Klaus, you child.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.242
I have waited months

05:03.244 --> 05:06.212
to see my daughter.

05:06.214 --> 05:08.414
I can wait one more day.

05:11.585 --> 05:13.285
Elijah.

05:13.287 --> 05:16.755
Do whatever it takes to keep her safe.

05:16.757 --> 05:18.724
I give you my word.

05:22.362 --> 05:24.196
Wolves are freaking out.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.531
They know it had to be an insider

05:25.533 --> 05:27.132
who took down Vincent last night,

05:27.134 --> 05:28.467
seeing as no one could
have been anywhere near him.

05:28.469 --> 05:30.102
Anybody suspect it was you?

05:30.104 --> 05:32.037
No, not yet, but they're
gonna figure it out,

05:32.039 --> 05:33.472
which pretty much means I'm screwed

05:33.474 --> 05:36.675
unless we come up with a plan.

05:36.677 --> 05:40.012
Call a meeting, the whole pack tonight.

05:40.014 --> 05:41.880
If they're so scared,
now's the perfect time

05:41.882 --> 05:43.916
to convince them they need to ditch Esther.

05:43.918 --> 05:45.384
She gave them moonlight rings.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.219
Well, those rings make you slaves.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.587
No. They make us powerful.

05:48.589 --> 05:49.822
We were exiles before,

05:49.824 --> 05:51.023
but now we run the city.

05:51.025 --> 05:52.224
The vampires are scared of us,

05:52.226 --> 05:53.492
and no one, including me is just

05:53.494 --> 05:54.726
gonna walk away from that because...

05:54.728 --> 05:57.129
set the damn meeting.

06:09.275 --> 06:11.576
So are you gonna work on a rousing speech

06:11.578 --> 06:13.078
or just get day drunk?

06:13.080 --> 06:14.413
Little bit of both.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.882
Jack, it's 10 A.M.

06:27.773 --> 06:31.643
You know, for months, I wrote
down every single word Ansel said,

06:31.645 --> 06:34.446
the entire history of our people.

06:34.448 --> 06:35.814
If only I'd know he was Klaus' father,

06:35.816 --> 06:38.216
I would have asked him
a hell of a lot more.

06:40.419 --> 06:42.287
You know, I was up all
night looking through this,

06:42.289 --> 06:44.389
trying to find something, anything

06:44.391 --> 06:45.623
that will help me figure out how to get

06:45.625 --> 06:47.158
the people back together.

06:48.727 --> 06:51.329
Let me guess... no such luck.

06:51.331 --> 06:54.098
Nothing viable.

06:54.100 --> 06:57.302
And now Ansel's dead

06:57.304 --> 07:00.371
along with Ollie, so forgive me

07:00.373 --> 07:02.040
if I need a beer because right now,

07:02.042 --> 07:04.175
I can use all the help I can get.

07:15.421 --> 07:17.054
I screwed up, you guys.

07:17.056 --> 07:18.790
I was with Kaleb last night,

07:18.792 --> 07:22.560
and he took the white oak
stake when I was asleep.

07:22.562 --> 07:24.595
I... I'm sorry. I never
should have trusted him.

07:24.597 --> 07:26.864
Kol doesn't have the stake.

07:26.866 --> 07:29.033
Klaus does. Matter of fact,

07:29.035 --> 07:31.102
Klaus has Kol, too.

07:31.104 --> 07:33.838
What? How is that possible?

07:33.840 --> 07:36.240
D, I'm the one who took him.

07:36.242 --> 07:38.709
I saw an opportunity, and
I wasn't gonna pass it up,

07:38.711 --> 07:42.613
and trust me... we are all safer this way.

07:42.615 --> 07:45.382
Not Kaleb. Klaus will kill him.

07:45.384 --> 07:47.852
His name isn't Kaleb. It's Kol,

07:47.854 --> 07:49.787
and Klaus has had a
thousand years to kill him,

07:49.789 --> 07:51.489
and he hasn't, so worry less about him

07:51.491 --> 07:52.890
and more about yourself.

07:52.892 --> 07:54.925
All right. This guy is not your friend.

07:54.927 --> 07:57.394
He wants to use you to get his own way.

07:57.396 --> 07:59.029
You don't know him like I do.

07:59.031 --> 08:01.332
I know him better than you do.

08:05.437 --> 08:08.472
Now I'm sorry I had to go behind your back,

08:08.474 --> 08:09.840
and I hate lying to you, I really do,

08:09.842 --> 08:12.242
but believe me, this is for your own good.

08:12.244 --> 08:14.011
I got to take care of
some business, all right?

08:14.013 --> 08:16.013
Stick with Josh.

08:17.415 --> 08:19.750
Everything's gonna be ok.

08:24.122 --> 08:26.256
Elijah's off his bloody rocker.

08:26.258 --> 08:29.960
We need to get out of here.

08:29.962 --> 08:33.397
Are you gonna help me or what?

08:33.399 --> 08:34.664
If you were a little more clever,

08:34.667 --> 08:35.933
you would recognize that there's

08:35.934 --> 08:38.101
opportunity in our current circumstances.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.404
Opportunity to what, get a beating?

08:40.405 --> 08:43.273
Gentlemen, I apologize
for keeping you waiting.

08:43.275 --> 08:45.509
Good news is I have
returned with an old friend,

08:45.511 --> 08:49.146
someone who wants to say hello.

08:49.148 --> 08:51.481
Hello.

08:51.483 --> 08:52.783
How's it going, fellas?

08:52.785 --> 08:54.818
Ah, you again. You ever get bored

08:54.820 --> 08:57.020
of getting bullied by my brother?

08:57.022 --> 08:58.522
Oh, I volunteered for this.

08:58.524 --> 09:00.123
- Did you?
- Yeah. The way I see it,

09:00.125 --> 09:01.291
you have it coming.

09:01.293 --> 09:03.360
First, you messed with Davina.

09:03.362 --> 09:06.396
Now I hear you want to
drag Rebekah into all this.

09:06.398 --> 09:08.164
Uh-uh. Not happening.

09:08.166 --> 09:11.434
Well, I'd prefer you both to
join me against our mother,

09:11.436 --> 09:13.703
but I'll happily settle
for one or the other.

09:13.705 --> 09:16.506
Either way, if you continue to defy me,

09:16.508 --> 09:18.508
your lives will be reduced
to an unending sequence

09:18.510 --> 09:21.378
of agonizing torture.

09:21.380 --> 09:24.014
So...

09:24.016 --> 09:25.749
Which is it to be?

09:32.634 --> 09:34.902
I've got to say I'm gonna enjoy this.

09:35.504 --> 09:38.371
Out of the whole twisted
family... sit down...

09:38.373 --> 09:40.607
you are the one that I like the least.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.722
Yeah? Well, there's a pretty young lady

09:42.724 --> 09:44.758
who disagrees with that opinion.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.060
Then let me make myself perfectly clear.

09:47.062 --> 09:48.661
You go near Davina, and I'm
gonna cut off parts of you

09:48.663 --> 09:49.863
that you'd rather keep.

09:49.865 --> 09:52.932
Ahh. More threats. How bloody inventive.

09:52.934 --> 09:55.602
Thing is, Klaus needs me,

09:55.604 --> 09:58.071
so that backs you into a
bit of a corner, doesn't it?

09:58.073 --> 09:59.839
Well, until we get rid of your mom.

09:59.841 --> 10:01.908
I wonder what happens then.

10:01.910 --> 10:03.676
Well, Klaus might not
need me when mother's gone,

10:03.678 --> 10:05.714
but you might.

10:07.796 --> 10:10.363
Come on, Marcel. You were
king of the city once.

10:10.365 --> 10:13.366
You really think he's just
gonna give it back to you?

10:17.337 --> 10:19.772
You always got an angle, don't you?

10:19.774 --> 10:22.341
You see, individually,
we can't do anything,

10:22.343 --> 10:26.748
but together, well, Klaus
wouldn't stand a chance.

10:28.750 --> 10:32.585
Probably not, but then
I'd have to trust you,

10:32.587 --> 10:34.320
and I don't.

10:34.322 --> 10:38.524
At least with Klaus, I know
exactly what I'm getting.

10:38.526 --> 10:41.327
I thought you had more
fortitude, Marcellus.

10:41.329 --> 10:43.262
You disappoint me.

10:45.132 --> 10:47.500
Nobody cares for your opinion.

10:47.502 --> 10:51.003
Klaus just wants to know what you're up to.

10:51.005 --> 10:54.507
Tell me everything,
maybe you'll get to live.

10:55.009 --> 10:57.009
If not...

11:00.080 --> 11:02.414
For the record, yes, I knew what

11:02.416 --> 11:04.516
Marcel was up to, and you
can hate me if you want to...

11:04.518 --> 11:06.085
I don't hate you, Josh.

11:06.087 --> 11:08.587
I'm just sick of worrying about you

11:08.589 --> 11:10.356
and Marcel, and most of all,

11:10.358 --> 11:13.325
I am tired of Klaus always
being in the middle of it.

11:13.327 --> 11:15.461
You know, every time I
try to stand up to him...

11:15.463 --> 11:18.430
it hasn't worked out so well.

11:18.432 --> 11:22.000
Yeah. Well, failure, party of two.

11:22.002 --> 11:24.570
You seem to be doing all right.

11:24.572 --> 11:28.407
Uh, yeah, except that every werewolf
in town is trying to kill me.

11:28.409 --> 11:32.477
Well, except for the superhot
one that I'm sort of dating,

11:32.479 --> 11:34.079
but that's got its own problems, though.

11:34.081 --> 11:37.582
It's kind of a, uh, Romeo and Romeo thing.

11:37.584 --> 11:40.619
And how hot is this Romeo?

11:40.621 --> 11:42.154
Well...

11:44.624 --> 11:46.491
Pretty hot!

11:46.493 --> 11:47.959
Definitely worth the drama.

11:47.961 --> 11:51.530
Yeah.

11:51.532 --> 11:54.166
Invite him over.

11:54.168 --> 11:57.169
Yeah. I want to meet him.

11:57.571 --> 12:00.172
Come on. Do it.

12:01.942 --> 12:04.709
Do you think our mother
is even the least bit

12:04.711 --> 12:07.812
concerned for your well-being?

12:07.814 --> 12:10.548
She knows I don't need rescuing.

12:10.550 --> 12:14.452
Hmm? Ehh.

12:14.454 --> 12:16.288
You can toy with me all you want, Niklaus,

12:16.290 --> 12:19.491
but you've had innumerable
opportunities to kill me.

12:19.493 --> 12:21.862
But I didn't, did I?

12:23.864 --> 12:27.133
Finn, I understand your devotion to her.

12:29.135 --> 12:31.369
She must have clung to
you with desperate need

12:31.371 --> 12:32.871
after our sister Freya died,

12:32.873 --> 12:34.839
making you believe

12:34.841 --> 12:37.876
it was your responsibility to care for her

12:37.878 --> 12:40.645
always and forever, hmm,

12:40.647 --> 12:44.349
a burden which you
accepted without question

12:44.751 --> 12:47.952
because you were a good son.

12:49.989 --> 12:55.526
Small children lack the capacity
to question their parents,

12:55.528 --> 12:57.697
but you're a man now, Finn.

12:59.755 --> 13:02.956
Is that the extent of your argument?

13:02.958 --> 13:08.795
I'm a man now, so I should
join your wretched cause?

13:08.797 --> 13:11.298
Is it not better to join me

13:11.300 --> 13:13.300
than spend the remainder
of your mortal life

13:13.302 --> 13:16.403
aligned to a woman who
always manipulated you?

13:16.405 --> 13:20.707
Brother, I offer you the
opportunity to free yourself.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.744
Side with me, and I will give you

13:23.746 --> 13:25.912
the life she never once offered,

13:25.914 --> 13:29.917
a chance to choose your own path.

13:30.619 --> 13:32.652
The choice is yours, brother.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.626
You want to stop playing mountain man

13:39.628 --> 13:41.962
and explain why you kept this from me?

13:43.332 --> 13:45.332
Why don't I jog your memory?

13:45.334 --> 13:46.967
"The werewolf's power can be traced back

13:46.969 --> 13:49.536
to the myth of the unification ceremony,

13:49.538 --> 13:52.372
a ritual that bestowed
certain unique abilities

13:52.374 --> 13:56.242
onto every member of the pack."

13:56.244 --> 13:57.977
Do you believe this?

13:57.979 --> 14:00.346
I didn't at first,

14:00.348 --> 14:02.615
and then Ansel swore he
saw it with his own eyes,

14:02.617 --> 14:04.017
and then he dies, and I find out he's

14:04.019 --> 14:06.319
resurrected from a thousand years ago,

14:06.321 --> 14:08.688
which means he was alive to see it.

14:08.690 --> 14:10.623
How did I not know about this?

14:10.625 --> 14:12.292
You didn't grow up out here.

14:12.294 --> 14:14.193
Every kid grows up hearing the stories.

14:14.195 --> 14:18.464
Back in the day, werewolf
bloodlines were all distinct, right?

14:18.466 --> 14:20.533
Some had speed, some had strength,

14:20.535 --> 14:23.403
some could sense enemies from miles away.

14:23.405 --> 14:27.774
Now to evolve, you would perform a ritual.

14:28.676 --> 14:31.244
A shaman would marry the
alphas of each bloodline,

14:31.246 --> 14:33.045
and then the special abilities of each

14:33.047 --> 14:36.816
would be inherited mystically

14:36.818 --> 14:39.652
by everyone who participated in the ritual.

14:39.654 --> 14:41.487
See, after a few centuries, everybody had

14:41.489 --> 14:43.856
the same abilities, so Alpha
marriages became political.

14:43.858 --> 14:48.995
They became about power, about territory.

14:48.997 --> 14:51.764
But I have a unique ability.

14:51.766 --> 14:55.735
Because I'm a hybrid, I
can control when I change,

14:55.737 --> 14:58.604
so if this mystical marriage thing works,

14:58.606 --> 15:00.840
then our people get my power,

15:00.842 --> 15:02.475
and they can ditch the rings,

15:02.477 --> 15:06.979
which means Esther no
longer has a hold over them.

15:06.981 --> 15:11.850
Jack, this is exactly the answer
that we've been looking for.

15:11.852 --> 15:13.586
Let's find a shaman, we'll say some vows.

15:13.588 --> 15:15.454
Hell, we'll make it a party.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.825
It ain't just a party.

15:19.827 --> 15:23.228
If the vows ain't honored, it doesn't work.

15:25.832 --> 15:27.966
It's got to be a real marriage in every way

15:27.968 --> 15:31.403
for the rest of our lives.

15:31.405 --> 15:33.172
Are you up for that?

15:35.642 --> 15:37.142
Uh...

15:41.581 --> 15:43.315
Didn't think so.

16:01.350 --> 16:03.451
Hayley, hey. What's up?

16:03.453 --> 16:04.986
I need a favor.

16:07.409 --> 16:09.277
Are you sure you're ok?

16:09.279 --> 16:12.547
Yeah. I must just be
coming down with something.

16:12.549 --> 16:14.348
I'm sorry to drag you out of bed for this.

16:14.350 --> 16:16.751
Please. You just discovered
an ancient marriage ritual

16:16.753 --> 16:19.654
with pretty drastic supernatural
and personal implications.

16:19.656 --> 16:22.890
The least I could do is get out of bed.

16:22.892 --> 16:25.826
So this is everything I found
in my uncle's files about

16:25.828 --> 16:28.062
werewolf ceremonies and rituals.

16:28.064 --> 16:30.831
Mostly it sounds like
old folklore and fables.

16:32.701 --> 16:36.837
But I'm guessing you're not here
looking for some kind of proof.

16:36.839 --> 16:39.773
I don't know what I'm looking for.

16:39.775 --> 16:43.577
Not to pry, but does
Jackson have any answers?

16:43.579 --> 16:45.446
He doesn't even want to talk about it.

16:45.448 --> 16:47.715
He doesn't even want to
put me in this position.

16:47.717 --> 16:51.151
He's a good, decent guy,

16:51.153 --> 16:54.188
if those even exist anymore.

16:54.190 --> 16:57.358
And I'm assuming he knows about Elijah.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.693
Elijah and I have barely spoken

16:59.695 --> 17:02.730
since I became a hybrid,

17:02.732 --> 17:04.865
but still he is...

17:04.867 --> 17:07.000
Under your skin.

17:10.305 --> 17:14.375
Ahem. Well, there's no
right answer to this.

17:14.777 --> 17:17.944
You just have to figure
out what's best for you,

17:17.946 --> 17:19.780
and think long and hard about your decision

17:19.781 --> 17:23.550
because you're the one who's
going to have to live with it.

17:23.551 --> 17:25.385
No pressure.

17:31.359 --> 17:33.760
Hey. What's that on your back?

17:52.213 --> 17:54.314
Nice music. Girl's got taste.

17:54.316 --> 17:56.917
Oh, please. That was my call.

17:56.919 --> 17:58.918
She wanted Puccini.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.421
Ha ha ha! You must be Aiden...

18:01.423 --> 18:03.290
supercool, superhandsome...

18:03.292 --> 18:06.593
Werewolf traitor.

18:06.595 --> 18:09.996
I'm sorry. That was a dumb joke.

18:09.998 --> 18:12.031
Uh, hey. I was gonna go order some food.

18:12.033 --> 18:14.034
Do you like Thai?

18:14.036 --> 18:15.301
Uh, sure.

18:15.303 --> 18:16.803
Great.

18:19.940 --> 18:22.742
That wasn't planned at all, was it?

18:22.744 --> 18:24.110
Nope.

18:27.214 --> 18:29.716
Hey. You ok?

18:29.718 --> 18:33.520
The "werewolf traitor" thing, is there

18:33.722 --> 18:35.922
more trouble with your pack people?

18:36.224 --> 18:39.125
Guess we'll find out soon enough.

18:39.127 --> 18:42.428
I actually called a meeting tonight

18:42.430 --> 18:46.199
for Hayley and Jackson,
so one way or another,

18:46.201 --> 18:49.435
it's all coming to a head.

18:49.437 --> 18:53.272
You know, those people look up to you.

18:53.274 --> 18:55.341
I mean, trust me. I've seen you in action.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.244
You're a badass.

18:58.246 --> 19:02.515
So just go in there and
tell them what's what.

19:02.917 --> 19:04.617
I'm not the Alpha.

19:04.619 --> 19:06.819
No, but Jackson is,

19:06.821 --> 19:09.121
and the pack respects both of you,

19:09.123 --> 19:11.791
so if you stand with him,

19:11.793 --> 19:13.592
they will listen.

19:13.594 --> 19:15.094
One thing I learned from Marcel...

19:15.096 --> 19:16.262
Hmm?

19:16.264 --> 19:19.965
Loyalty sends a powerful message,

19:19.967 --> 19:21.767
and hey, look. If you get nervous

19:21.769 --> 19:24.970
or, like, need a vote of
confidence or whatever,

19:24.972 --> 19:27.907
just remember that, uh...

19:27.909 --> 19:29.975
I think you're pretty amazing.

19:58.571 --> 20:00.372
I'm a little surprised we
don't hear clapping right now.

20:00.374 --> 20:02.808
Yeah. Totally.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.309
Hey, Davina.

20:04.311 --> 20:06.411
You can come down now.

20:08.147 --> 20:09.548
Davina.

20:54.094 --> 20:56.728
We can deep doing this as long as you want,

20:56.730 --> 20:59.531
or...

20:59.533 --> 21:01.199
I can kill you now and turn you into

21:01.201 --> 21:03.134
a brand-new baby vampire.

21:04.804 --> 21:06.804
Go on. Do it.

21:06.806 --> 21:09.707
My mother's got plans for
me whether I like it or not.

21:09.709 --> 21:12.610
If I die, she'll just
pop me into another body,

21:12.612 --> 21:14.112
not that my family will care that much

21:14.114 --> 21:16.214
if the death was permanent.

21:19.852 --> 21:21.419
What are you really up to,

21:21.421 --> 21:23.621
hmm, and what's it got to do with Davina?

21:23.623 --> 21:27.458
You're afraid I'm gonna
break her little heart.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.995
That's downright paternal of you, Marcel.

21:30.997 --> 21:34.065
Easy, Marcel, easy.

21:34.067 --> 21:36.300
Let's give Kol a little longer to decide

21:36.302 --> 21:39.270
before we lop off his head, hmm?

21:39.272 --> 21:40.938
Comments like that...

21:40.940 --> 21:45.943
he already thinks that you don't care.

21:45.945 --> 21:49.080
Is that so, brother?

21:49.082 --> 21:52.917
You only daggered me a dozen times.

21:52.919 --> 21:55.419
You always cared more for
Marcel than you did for me.

21:55.421 --> 21:58.122
Well, I didn't realize
I'd hurt your feelings.

21:58.124 --> 22:00.491
Well, that's the thing, isn't it, Nik?

22:00.493 --> 22:02.760
You don't know squat about me.

22:02.762 --> 22:04.462
Ah, but thanks to Marcel,

22:04.464 --> 22:07.231
I know all I need to.

22:07.233 --> 22:10.968
You're desperate to be a part
of this family, aren't you?

22:10.970 --> 22:15.039
All of your mischief was
just attempts for attention.

22:15.041 --> 22:18.342
You know, the truth is, Kol,
you're right to feel slighted.

22:18.344 --> 22:20.077
I mean that. You're right,

22:20.079 --> 22:21.679
but perhaps there's still time

22:21.681 --> 22:23.480
to make it up to you.

23:01.119 --> 23:04.588
You have reached the voice mailbox of...

23:11.929 --> 23:14.531
Tell me...

23:14.533 --> 23:17.667
Has there been anyone out
of the ordinary here today?

23:20.571 --> 23:22.239
Just you.

23:27.345 --> 23:28.912
Oh! I am so sorry. Let me...

23:28.914 --> 23:30.880
That's quite all right.

23:30.882 --> 23:32.382
Thank you.

23:37.688 --> 23:39.189
Tsk.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.962
I told you to clean yourself up...

23:48.166 --> 23:49.866
That if you were clean, no one would know

23:49.868 --> 23:52.101
what you aree, what you've done.

23:59.777 --> 24:02.378
So, brother,

24:02.380 --> 24:05.915
ready to embrace your new life of freedom?

24:05.917 --> 24:09.285
I'm already free, brother.

24:11.632 --> 24:13.900
You're aware our mother
cares nothing for you?

24:13.902 --> 24:16.536
Niklaus, I assure you, my mother loves me.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.237
She loves all of her children.

24:18.239 --> 24:21.907
We would not exist without her sacrifice.

24:24.411 --> 24:27.079
Do you even know the truth,

24:27.081 --> 24:29.348
that she was barren,

24:29.350 --> 24:31.917
and she grew so desperate for a family

24:31.919 --> 24:33.719
that she begged one of the most powerful

24:33.721 --> 24:35.087
witches in history for help,

24:35.089 --> 24:36.889
her sister Dahlia.

24:36.891 --> 24:38.724
Of course, Dahlia's price was high.

24:38.726 --> 24:40.226
She agreed to make our mother fertile,

24:40.228 --> 24:42.161
but in exchange, she sought

24:42.163 --> 24:44.663
the firstborn as sacrifice.

24:44.665 --> 24:47.667
Having no other choice...

24:48.769 --> 24:51.337
our mother gave away our beloved Freya.

24:51.339 --> 24:53.239
Our sister died of plague.

24:53.241 --> 24:56.575
Esther gave her away.

24:56.577 --> 25:01.714
Think about that, the pain,

25:01.716 --> 25:04.783
the grief.

25:04.855 --> 25:07.423
If you what you say is true,

25:07.425 --> 25:10.292
than death is far too
delicate a fate for her.

25:10.374 --> 25:12.708
She loves us more than you realize.

25:12.710 --> 25:15.310
And is love the reason
she wanted my child dead?

25:15.312 --> 25:17.813
She was trying to protect
you from Dahlia's curse.

25:17.815 --> 25:19.348
What curse?!

25:19.350 --> 25:22.818
Dahlia demanded the
firstborn of every generation.

25:22.820 --> 25:25.787
Had your child lived, she
would have paid the price,

25:25.789 --> 25:29.591
and if anyone had tried to protect her,

25:29.593 --> 25:33.495
Dahlia would come and destroy us all.

26:13.435 --> 26:15.937
Look at you.

26:15.939 --> 26:19.175
So big, so perfect.

26:20.577 --> 26:24.946
I can't imagine the joy of
spending every day with her.

26:24.948 --> 26:26.147
It's...

26:26.149 --> 26:27.949
Quite lovely.

26:27.951 --> 26:30.885
Feels so human.

26:30.887 --> 26:36.424
Yes. Some would argue the
most human of experiences.

26:36.426 --> 26:41.495
I know I have to give her back
to Hayley when the time is right,

26:41.497 --> 26:43.364
but she's made me realize how much

26:43.366 --> 26:47.001
I want that child of my own
that I know I can't have.

26:47.003 --> 26:49.370
A lovely dream.

26:49.372 --> 26:53.007
Unfortunately, it's one
that's just beyond our reach,

26:53.009 --> 26:56.043
considering the curse of our existence.

26:56.045 --> 26:58.445
Seems Esther's attacking
with her usual fervor.

26:58.447 --> 27:01.782
Yes. Mother tortured me
for days with memories

27:01.784 --> 27:04.151
I thought I'd buried long ago.

27:07.555 --> 27:10.824
Then she made an offer

27:10.826 --> 27:15.896
to make us all mortal again.

27:15.898 --> 27:18.132
You see, sister, mother believes that

27:18.134 --> 27:19.867
by placing us in new bodies

27:19.869 --> 27:24.071
we could then reclaim some kind of purity,

27:24.073 --> 27:26.773
even begin families of our own again.

27:29.744 --> 27:32.179
And I have to confess, Rebekah,

27:32.181 --> 27:34.147
this invitation, however
cruel the delivery,

27:34.149 --> 27:37.852
had a certain kind of... appeal.

27:51.966 --> 27:55.068
You needn't worry.

27:55.070 --> 27:57.037
We're safe.

28:01.576 --> 28:04.110
Looks like this little one
needs her diaper changed.

28:08.215 --> 28:09.816
Here, my love.

28:39.713 --> 28:41.714
I'm done leaving messages, Elijah.

28:41.716 --> 28:44.384
To say this is urgent would
be a gross understatement.

28:44.386 --> 28:46.519
We need to speak immediately.

28:48.956 --> 28:52.058
I was wondering whether you'd show up.

28:52.060 --> 28:54.460
I'm afraid I'm not done
torturing your darling Kol.

28:54.462 --> 28:56.562
You best run along while you still can.

28:56.564 --> 28:59.165
I'm not going anywhere, Klaus.

28:59.167 --> 29:02.269
Whoa. D, today is not the day.

29:03.271 --> 29:05.972
Actually, I think it is.

29:11.778 --> 29:14.113
Looks like it's just you and me now.

29:16.316 --> 29:20.453
I know you're angry and scared,

29:20.455 --> 29:25.324
but we are a pack, no matter what.

29:25.326 --> 29:28.127
You've been checked out for months.

29:28.129 --> 29:29.829
Why should we listen to you?

29:29.831 --> 29:31.964
Because he's the Alpha.

29:31.966 --> 29:33.499
You got a problem with that?

29:33.501 --> 29:36.669
I want to hear what Jackson has to say.

29:36.671 --> 29:38.838
This is a pack meeting.

29:38.840 --> 29:41.473
You're not one of us anymore.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.975
No?

29:53.320 --> 29:56.121
I am still a wolf,

29:56.123 --> 29:59.391
and I didn't need any magical rings

29:59.393 --> 30:03.128
to control when or how I change.

30:03.130 --> 30:07.566
You want the same? Then sit down, shut up,

30:07.568 --> 30:09.401
and listen.

30:14.340 --> 30:16.174
You forget yourself.

30:16.176 --> 30:18.243
You're not as powerful as you once were,

30:18.245 --> 30:20.145
harvest girl.

30:20.147 --> 30:23.081
Doesn't mean I can't still kick your ass.

30:40.466 --> 30:42.734
Such hubris,

30:42.736 --> 30:46.204
and from one who bleeds so easily.

30:46.206 --> 30:49.708
Unh.

30:49.710 --> 30:52.978
You talk such a big game,

30:52.980 --> 30:57.048
but you couldn't even kill
Mikael when you had the chance.

30:57.050 --> 30:59.451
He was right about you, you know?

30:59.453 --> 31:02.253
You're weak.

31:23.254 --> 31:25.989
It's impressive.

31:25.991 --> 31:27.824
What exactly did you do to him?

31:27.826 --> 31:31.194
Channeled dark objects,
turned my blood to poison.

31:31.196 --> 31:33.096
How did you get free?

31:33.098 --> 31:35.198
Oh, it's a long story. Better question is

31:35.200 --> 31:37.734
if he's not dead, then what are
you gonna do when he recovers?

31:37.736 --> 31:39.069
We have an hour, maybe less,

31:39.071 --> 31:40.303
enough time to chain him, bleed him,

31:40.305 --> 31:41.638
dump him in the river.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.073
That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

31:43.075 --> 31:45.142
Since when do you care
what happens to Klaus?

31:47.479 --> 31:51.114
Kol is with us now.

31:51.116 --> 31:52.783
We're gonna be going up against Esther,

31:52.785 --> 31:55.685
assuming Klaus is upright.

31:55.687 --> 31:58.255
Look. Nik... he's a pain in the ass,

31:58.257 --> 32:00.323
but, well, she's a problem for us all.

32:00.325 --> 32:01.858
Klaus is the problem.

32:01.860 --> 32:03.293
I don't give a damn what happens to Esther.

32:03.295 --> 32:05.495
Yeah? Well, I sure do.

32:07.632 --> 32:09.432
Should I even ask?

32:09.434 --> 32:11.468
Cami, you should go. It's not safe.

32:11.470 --> 32:13.303
No kidding. I woke up with puncture wounds

32:13.305 --> 32:15.171
all up and down my spine and no idea

32:15.173 --> 32:16.339
how they got there.

32:16.341 --> 32:17.674
According to my uncle's files,

32:17.676 --> 32:18.875
they're a part of this ancient spell,

32:18.877 --> 32:20.276
and I don't know about you guys,

32:20.278 --> 32:21.644
but when I see "ancient" and "spell"

32:21.646 --> 32:23.079
in the same sentence,

32:23.081 --> 32:26.783
I think Esther.

32:26.785 --> 32:29.652
You all need help, and you know it.

32:29.654 --> 32:32.088
Now whatever it is that you think of me,

32:32.090 --> 32:33.957
I was born a Crescent.

32:33.959 --> 32:36.192
I'm the last of the Labonair line,

32:36.194 --> 32:38.228
which makes me an Alpha.

32:38.230 --> 32:41.264
Jackson is your Alpha.

32:41.266 --> 32:44.701
Now I don't know how many of you
bought the story you grew up with,

32:44.703 --> 32:47.737
the unification myth.

32:47.739 --> 32:50.175
Well, it is all true.

32:52.177 --> 32:57.513
Which means if Jackson and I get married,

32:57.515 --> 33:00.049
anyone with the guts to
turn up to the ceremony

33:00.051 --> 33:03.452
has as much control over
their wolf form as I do.

33:05.490 --> 33:06.889
Hayley, what are you doing?

33:06.891 --> 33:08.724
What needs to be done.

33:13.163 --> 33:16.732
This isn't just about uniting our pack.

33:16.734 --> 33:19.769
It's about forming a new community.

33:22.139 --> 33:25.241
This ceremony will
change everything for us.

33:25.243 --> 33:29.645
It will give us the strength
we need to defend ourselves.

33:29.647 --> 33:34.250
Then and only then will
we finally have peace.

33:37.888 --> 33:40.689
The choice is yours.

33:40.691 --> 33:43.425
Keep the rings and be somebody's bitch,

33:43.427 --> 33:47.963
or be part of the greatest
pack that ever lived.

33:59.242 --> 34:00.776
I'm in.

34:10.587 --> 34:13.054
Yeah, that's mum's work all right.

34:13.056 --> 34:15.056
She must have wiped your memory.

34:15.059 --> 34:16.591
Not the first time that's been done

34:16.592 --> 34:17.859
by a member of this family.

34:17.860 --> 34:19.261
What does it mean?

34:19.263 --> 34:21.964
It's a byproduct of a preparation spell.

34:21.966 --> 34:23.598
Preparation for what?

34:23.600 --> 34:27.002
To make her a vessel.

34:27.004 --> 34:29.771
He means Esther prepared your body

34:29.773 --> 34:32.007
for someone to jump into.

34:32.009 --> 34:35.078
Likely herself. I mean, knowing mother.

34:38.648 --> 34:40.282
Where's Vincent?

34:47.623 --> 34:50.527
Why me out of everyone in this city?

34:52.529 --> 34:54.429
Because you're perfect...

34:54.431 --> 35:00.035
healthy, beautiful, smart, and alone.

35:00.037 --> 35:03.471
No one would question
any personality changes,

35:03.473 --> 35:05.773
and as I discovered from our sessions,

35:05.775 --> 35:07.242
Niklaus would never allow you to be harmed.

35:07.244 --> 35:08.710
Fix this.

35:08.712 --> 35:10.211
Do something to stop it.

35:10.213 --> 35:12.780
I can't. Only my mother can.

35:12.782 --> 35:14.382
I will step in front of a moving truck

35:14.384 --> 35:17.888
before I let your mother take over my body.

35:19.890 --> 35:23.057
She wasn't preparing you for herself, Cami.

35:23.059 --> 35:26.094
She was preparing you for Rebekah.

35:41.678 --> 35:45.546
Well, she is all sorted
and ready for an adventure.

35:45.548 --> 35:47.515
Aren't you, luv?

35:52.888 --> 35:56.424
It's difficult to believe we
were all this innocent once.

35:59.661 --> 36:02.296
We mustn't let the world ever hurt her.

36:05.534 --> 36:08.102
You're right. We mustn't.

36:19.854 --> 36:21.355
How long do I have?

36:21.357 --> 36:24.841
Well, now that Esther knows
where Rebekah's hiding, not long.

36:25.693 --> 36:28.195
The only way to stop it is to stop her.

36:30.077 --> 36:31.744
Then let's do this.

36:31.746 --> 36:32.911
Marcel's a vampire,

36:32.913 --> 36:34.546
you both are powerful witches.

36:34.548 --> 36:36.582
Esther's stronger than
anything I've ever seen.

36:36.584 --> 36:38.584
We go up against her,

36:38.586 --> 36:40.452
we're gonna need Klaus.

36:40.454 --> 36:43.689
No. No. We can do this without him.

36:43.691 --> 36:46.091
I'm never gonna say this again,

36:46.093 --> 36:47.759
but Marcel's right.

36:47.761 --> 36:51.096
We do need the bastard.

36:51.098 --> 36:53.398
Davina...

36:53.400 --> 36:55.968
I know this is asking a lot,

36:55.970 --> 36:57.903
but please.

37:22.529 --> 37:24.863
What did you do to me?

37:24.865 --> 37:27.866
All you need to know is
that I beat you again.

37:27.868 --> 37:30.101
And yet you relented,

37:30.103 --> 37:32.037
which means you need me.

37:32.039 --> 37:33.772
Did I really lose?

37:39.478 --> 37:42.046
I'm sorry I sprung that on you.

37:44.483 --> 37:47.485
You know, I always thought it
would be me popping the question

37:47.487 --> 37:49.988
instead of being the one put on the spot.

37:54.627 --> 37:57.028
Are you sure you want to do this?

37:57.030 --> 37:58.897
Are you?

38:04.069 --> 38:08.306
Look. I knw you're only
doing this to help our people,

38:08.308 --> 38:12.977
but I promise I will be
a good husband to you.

38:27.059 --> 38:30.863
Hayley Marshall, will you marry me?

38:36.868 --> 38:38.669
No ring?

38:41.907 --> 38:43.741
Heh heh.

38:55.453 --> 38:57.888
Quite nice of you coming
to my rescue like that.

38:57.890 --> 38:59.557
You know, it's a good thing
you didn't actually steal

38:59.559 --> 39:01.158
the stake from me,

39:01.160 --> 39:02.893
or I'd have been the one torturing you.

39:02.895 --> 39:04.795
That mean you trust me now?

39:07.232 --> 39:08.899
Provided you're not busy concocting

39:08.901 --> 39:10.734
a new paralytic to use against me,

39:10.736 --> 39:12.569
I'd like a word with my brother.

39:12.571 --> 39:15.272
Well, to be honest, I can't
stand being around you anyway.

39:18.042 --> 39:20.177
For the record, didn't know a bloody thing

39:20.179 --> 39:23.847
about mother's plan for Cami, I swear.

39:23.849 --> 39:25.616
Well, I think I can judge for myself

39:25.618 --> 39:27.384
which of her schemes
she would entrust to you

39:27.386 --> 39:29.753
and which she would not.

39:29.755 --> 39:33.290
I believe this was Finn's task.

39:33.292 --> 39:35.259
And where, pray tell, is he now?

39:35.261 --> 39:36.693
He's waiting uncomfortably for me

39:36.695 --> 39:38.428
to return and deliver his punishment.

39:38.430 --> 39:41.098
Pass the beignets, would you?

39:41.100 --> 39:43.066
Now it's only a matter
of time before mother

39:43.068 --> 39:46.303
gets bored of waiting for you to let us go.

39:46.305 --> 39:48.939
Well, Finn at least.

39:48.941 --> 39:53.510
Don't expect she'd care
if I never came home.

39:53.512 --> 39:58.081
A mother cares for her
children, a monster does not.

39:58.083 --> 39:59.750
Once you accept she is the latter,

39:59.752 --> 40:02.319
you'll stop expecting the former.

40:04.388 --> 40:07.758
And despite what you might think, Kol,

40:08.560 --> 40:11.127
I did mourn you after your death,

40:11.129 --> 40:13.330
and I did attempt to avenge you.

40:13.332 --> 40:18.034
I would do nothing less
because we are brothers

40:18.036 --> 40:20.203
always and forever.

40:26.344 --> 40:27.877
Excuse me.

40:30.014 --> 40:31.614
Where have you been?

40:31.616 --> 40:33.450
Nik, it's me. Something's wrong.

40:33.452 --> 40:35.685
Elijah slaughtered a dozen
people whose only sin was

40:35.687 --> 40:37.487
their terrible taste in food.

40:37.489 --> 40:38.988
I mean, when have you known him to kill

40:38.990 --> 40:40.523
when he can otherwise compel?

40:40.525 --> 40:42.058
It's the kind of act that will draw

40:42.060 --> 40:44.594
our mother's attention.

40:44.596 --> 40:48.298
Her torture must have affected
him more deeply than I realized.

40:48.300 --> 40:49.465
Where is he now?

40:49.467 --> 40:51.300
I broke his neck to keep us safe,

40:51.302 --> 40:54.804
but I have no clue what to do next.

40:54.806 --> 40:56.339
Do you recall where we dined

40:56.341 --> 40:57.974
the Christmas after we fled Mikael?

40:57.976 --> 40:59.175
Of course.

40:59.177 --> 41:00.843
Go there now.

41:02.045 --> 41:04.147
If you enjoyed last night's activities,

41:04.149 --> 41:06.149
then you're in for a treat.

41:06.151 --> 41:07.550
Klaus, listen to me. Our mother...

41:07.552 --> 41:09.519
Not another word.

41:09.521 --> 41:12.121
No more fairytales about witches an curses.

41:12.123 --> 41:16.025
If it's a fairytale, then why
do I see fear in your eyes?

41:16.027 --> 41:17.326
Marcel!

41:17.328 --> 41:19.261
Bring it in.

41:19.263 --> 41:20.763
No.

41:23.433 --> 41:24.934
No, Niklaus.

41:24.936 --> 41:26.135
Oh, don't worry, brother.

41:26.137 --> 41:29.004
I made some air holes, small ones.

41:37.981 --> 41:40.049
Klaus, have you seen Elijah?

41:40.051 --> 41:42.017
There's something I need to tell you both.

41:42.019 --> 41:43.319
You can tell me on the way.

41:43.321 --> 41:45.421
What? Where are we going?

41:48.525 --> 41:50.826
To see our daughter.
