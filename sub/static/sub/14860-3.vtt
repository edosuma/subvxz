00:00.959 --> 00:01.948
(ALEX SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

00:04.505 --> 00:07.418
Beer for Alex, Penny;,
and my boo,

00:07.716 --> 00:09.457
and one "surprise me"...

00:09.760 --> 00:10.625
(GLASS CLATTERS)
...for Dave.

00:10.928 --> 00:11.633
(GASPS)
What is it?

00:11.929 --> 00:12.714
Hmm. Let's see.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.966
Mmm-hmm.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.427
I'm getting hints of lingonberry,
some bruised fig and...

00:17.726 --> 00:18.887
It's flat ginger ale.
Flat ginger ale.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.426
Oh! What a palate.

00:20.729 --> 00:21.685
Thank you for
the drinks, Jane.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.722
Oh, God, it's nothing.
| am rolling in it.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.265
Sold four cars today.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.524
Wow! I'm gonna go pay the tab.

00:27.819 --> 00:28.650
All right, man.
Come here.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.277
Mmm.
Mmm.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.654
My baby could sell snow
to an Eskimo.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.691
(CHUCKLES) And by
"snow," | mean cocaine.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.779
Eskimos traditionally don't
have a lot of disposable income,

00:37.079 --> 00:38.240
so it's a pretty impressive
sales feat

00:38.539 --> 00:39.199
if you really think about it.
You know what I mean?

00:39.498 --> 00:40.659
(INHALES SHARPLY)

00:40.958 --> 00:42.414
What I'm saying is
I'm proud of my baby.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.495
| love how cool you are with
Jane being the breadwinner

00:44.795 --> 00:46.035
and you staying home.

00:46.338 --> 00:49.706
It is like postgender city,
population progress.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.466
Yeah, you're like, "I'm Brad,
and I'm basically a woman.

00:52.761 --> 00:56.504
"| got an inverted wiener and
my boobs squirt milk. Postgender.”

00:56.807 --> 00:58.138
Okay, let's not get
carried away, okay?

00:58.433 --> 00:59.548
I'm still all man
up in here.

00:59.851 --> 01:00.636
Hey, honey,
do you have a pen?

01:00.936 --> 01:02.142
Uno momento, my dear.

ALEX: Oh! Mmm.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.932
That's great.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.017
Tissue.

01:07.109 --> 01:07.849
Iron Girl.

01:09.653 --> 01:10.734
Can never find
anything in here.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.278
Why do you have socks?

01:13.574 --> 01:14.188
In case we go dancing.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.026
Mmm-hmm.

01:16.243 --> 01:16.983
Ah-hal

01:18.036 --> 01:18.776
Hey, jerks, shut up!

01:20.205 --> 01:22.162
Hey, shut up,
you jerks!

01:22.457 --> 01:25.165
Focus on me, idiots!

01:25.460 --> 01:27.201
Why can't | meet a
nice guy? I'm nice.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.744
Not nice.
Totally off-putting.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.913
You just stole my beer.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.832
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you
bought it for me and set it over there.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.797
(BOTTLE THUDS) Guys, I'm
in a real man drought right now.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.507
Well, how do you normally
meet guys?

01:37.806 --> 01:39.513
| don't mean to sound cocky,
but they always come to me.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.220
Thanks.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.635
Oh, are you gay?

01:46.857 --> 01:48.188
Max, maybe you just need
to get out more.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.814
Right. Out there.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.817
Yes.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.819
So what you're saying is,
become a delivery man myself,

01:54.114 --> 01:55.525
meet them
at their homes,

01:55.824 --> 01:58.031
get to paid to have sex
and eat free food.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.193
Jane, you beautiful
broomstick, I love it,

02:00.495 --> 02:02.077
but here is the rub
with that.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.204
That basically makes me
a prostitute,

02:04.499 --> 02:05.660
which means I'm gonna
fall in love with the game,

02:05.959 --> 02:08.451
and there's no way
my pizzeria manager/pimp

02:08.753 --> 02:09.994
is gonna let me
out of the game.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.708
| mean,
I'm his top earner.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.463
Jane, ya dumb lamppost,

02:13.759 --> 02:14.373
your plan is garbage!

02:16.219 --> 02:17.675
(MUSIC PLAYING)

am off to the therapist.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.486
| think we are finally gonna get
to the bottom of her control issues.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.492
Oh, you know what? Could you
call the guy about the dimmer?

02:41.787 --> 02:42.902
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.411
Bye, guys.
Okay.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.992
JANE: (SINGSONG VOICE) Bye.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.907
Did you hear that?
"Call the guy"?

02:48.210 --> 02:50.167
Real men don't call the guy.
Real men am the guy.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.702
That is not English.

02:52.005 --> 02:52.995
That's okay.
The guy you call

02:53.298 --> 02:54.333
probably won't speak
English either. (CHUCKLES)

02:54.633 --> 02:56.670
Oof. Sorry.
| just visited my nana.

02:56.968 --> 02:57.878
No, seriously, Jane
doesn't think I'm man enough

02:58.178 --> 02:59.213
to do stuff like this.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.345
Dude, show her
that you are.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.348

help. I'm pretty handy.

squeak out of a cabinet last week.

You used butter, and then
you tried to make croissants

03:09.606 --> 03:10.721
and didn't have
enough butter

03:11.024 --> 03:12.059
and then screamed
into a brown bag.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.975

screamed into. Okay.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.893
God, you women would
not know areal man

03:16.196 --> 03:18.733
unless he came up and
slapped you in the face.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.818
| meant that in... in a
figure of speech kind of way,

03:21.118 --> 03:22.233
not a domestic violence
kind of way.

Bro, do you want to
man it up

03:25.747 --> 03:26.953

ourselves?

my spirit animal?

it. Pump it. (GRUNTS)

too! | mean, we all are,

about that now? It's sad.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.159
Duh! That's Winnie McCray.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.570
Duh! She's only, like, the
biggest pop star on the planet.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.739
Duh was the name
of her last album?

04:10.041 --> 04:11.156

too interested in music

04:11.460 --> 04:13.292

left the game.

Well, Winnie sings these,
like, cheesy teen love songs,

04:16.630 --> 04:18.497
like Ordinary Love,
with lyrics like,

04:18.800 --> 04:20.586
"Nobody knows what I'm like,
but they want to be like me."

that's how it goes. | don't know.

S Hee, hoo I

04:36.401 --> 04:37.607
Smash Mouth she ain't.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.065
You do realize that
selling Winnie a dress

04:40.363 --> 04:41.728
could help out
your store big-time?

04:42.032 --> 04:44.023
Of course I realize that.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.566
But first, you tell me how
you think that's gonna happen,

04:45.869 --> 04:47.200
and then I'll probably
say the same thing.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.157
Well, it's PR. 101.
Right.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.367
We tell the paparazzi where
Winnie's going on her date,

04:51.666 --> 04:53.623
then they photograph her
in the dress, and boom!

04:53.919 --> 04:55.876
Xela dresses are
the hottest fashion item

04:56.171 --> 04:58.583

little yellow cheater bracelets.

have all day.

about Smash Mouth.

Okay, what happened?

05:43.927 --> 05:45.088
(SIGHS) I went
to a gay bar last night,

05:45.387 --> 05:46.798
and nobody spoke to me.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.758
Not even a whiff.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.593
Let me guess the name
of the bar. This is so fun.

Club Tush. Dreamballs.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.968

Is it Club Tush?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.683
It was Greg's, Jane.

05:56.982 --> 05:57.596

was called Greg's.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.850

no, that's...

06:01.152 --> 06:02.563

That's clever.

Max, hello!
What?

06:05.407 --> 06:06.522

said hello yet. Hi.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.156
Oh, hey, buddy.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.284
And also hello, it was
twink night at Greg's.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.786
Nobody's gonna hit on you.
You're not a twink.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.697

06:15.000 --> 06:15.956
A guy who eats
a lot of Twinkies.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.286
A thin, sweet,
smooth pretty boy.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.826
Oh. It's one of our
many gay categories.

our queens, our daddies,

maple-smoked sausage patties,

and of course, our 6-tops.

are just things that are

Oh, Max,
| can't tell you that.

find himself himself.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.333
What? Just please
tell me what I am.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.789
| don't know, all right?

16:04.088 --> 16:05.249
| thought you would
figure it out,

16:05.548 --> 16:07.084
then I would take credit
for it, but...

16:07.383 --> 16:08.839
(SCOFFS) You're like
Anne Hathaway's accents.

16:09.135 --> 16:09.920
You're all over the place.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.459
He is right.

16:11.762 --> 16:12.593
According to my math,
you are 10% panther,

16:12.889 --> 16:14.800
15% wolf, 0% twink,

16:15.099 --> 16:15.759
and 40% body fat.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.174
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

16:18.478 --> 16:20.219
| guess no one will ever
love me.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.353
Now I know how
webisodes feel.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.639
But, Max, you're actually
lucky to not be in a category.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.774
I've been pigeonholed ever
since | came out of my mom.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.104
You know,
| looked back and I said,

16:28.404 --> 16:30.315
"I'm never gonna get near
one of those things again."

16:30.615 --> 16:33.653
Mmm! Mmm-mmm. But I'm not
complaining. | love being incredible.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.237
(CHUCKLES) But do I
wonder what it would be like

16:35.536 --> 16:37.823
to be less incredible?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.238
(LAUGHS) Well, of course
I think deep stuff like that.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.245
I'm incredible.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.955
Don't bend to fit
other people's groups.

16:48.257 --> 16:48.792
Make your own.

16:50.927 --> 16:51.962
You know what?
You guys are right.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.342
Bring it in.

16:53.638 --> 16:54.719
Oh! Mmm.
Mmm!

16:55.014 --> 16:56.675
(SNIFFS)
Is that whipped cream?

16:56.974 --> 16:58.806
No, it's actually
Greek yogurt.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.136
Oh. It's the closest
shave you can get...

17:01.187 --> 17:01.927
From a yogurt.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.016
Oh.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.431
Mmm. It's probably
a circuit breaker.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.223
Yep. That's what
| was thinkin'.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.227
Circuit breaker.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.025
The ol' CB.

17:13.324 --> 17:14.609
(CLICKS TONGUE) Can't
live with circuit breakers,

17:14.909 --> 17:15.740
can't live without 'em.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.031
You don't know what a
circuit breaker is, do you?

17:20.330 --> 17:22.789
Whoa, bro. Whoa.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.325
You questioning my
manhood, bro? Maybe.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.617
You didn't even know
the difference between

17:26.921 --> 17:28.377
a Phillips head screwdriver

17:28.673 --> 17:31.381
<i>and a screwdriver
with the other.. head.</i>

17:31.676 --> 17:33.292
So you know what? | am
way more of a man than you.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.925
That is malarkey, sir.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.006
Malarkey?
Yeah.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.261
That is flat-out malarkey.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.013
Sir, I do doth protest.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.594
| don't protest,
all right?

17:40.893 --> 17:41.633
| am way more of a man
than you'll ever bel

17:41.936 --> 17:42.801
Not true, man.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.015
(GRUNTING)

17:46.524 --> 17:48.481
(GASPS)

17:48.776 --> 17:51.143
(PANTING) Jane, I'm
winning the man-am games.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.436
| deadlifted this
plate chair six times.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.854
| broke
the five times barrier.

17:55.741 --> 17:56.902
David?

17:57.201 --> 17:58.532
(CHUCKLES)
Okay.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.493
"Arm wrestling.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.121
"Toaster toss.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.702
"Naming types of sharks."”

18:05.001 --> 18:06.457
Guess who won that.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.040
What is this?
Like a pissing contest?

18:10.339 --> 18:10.999
Oh, I already won
that event.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.250
Oh.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.754
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
The limo's here.

18:16.053 --> 18:16.918
Okay, so you're just gonna
get out there and go right in it.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.427
Right. And then the
paparazzi will follow.

18:18.723 --> 18:19.212
Do I look like Winnie?

18:20.516 --> 18:21.051
Now you do. Get out!

18:21.976 --> 18:23.216
Okay!
Go!

18:23.519 --> 18:24.475
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Go! Go! Go!

18:24.770 --> 18:25.760
MAN: Here she is!

18:26.063 --> 18:27.019
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

18:27.315 --> 18:28.055
(THUD)
ALL: Oh!

18:29.942 --> 18:30.556
(PANTING) Ugh!

18:31.444 --> 18:32.809
It's not even her.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.604
(CRYING) How could I
have hit my big head again?

18:35.906 --> 18:38.898
My big head is so big.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.737
(TRUCK DOOR CLOSES)
Thanks, Dave.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.529
(PANTING) Okay, nobody
knows that you're here.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.447
And this time, your
secret is safe. | promise.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.206
So enjoy
your secret date.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.918
Hey, Winnie.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.830
Miss McCray, Alex has
specifically requested

18:54.133 --> 18:56.215
that you not be given
VIP treatment tonight.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.547
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.257
There's only
one problem.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.342
Here at Steak Me Home
Tonight, everyone is a VIP.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.803
Ugh. Dave.

19:04.101 --> 19:04.715
I'll drive.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.393
(GIGGLES)
So cute.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.645
(SIGHS) Look,
| know you're mad,

19:09.940 --> 19:11.351
but the only reason
| even did all this

19:11.651 --> 19:13.483
is because you've been making
me feel insecure about my manhood.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.236
Brad, don't get
freaked out

19:16.530 --> 19:18.612
because I am making mad coin
at the car dealership.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.273
I'm stressin'.

19:20.576 --> 19:21.737
This manhood stuff
is all in your head.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.822
| mean, you could not be
acting more like a man right now.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.237
Stupid, stubborn,
and smelly.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.248
Seriously, did you power
wash this place with farts?

19:29.543 --> 19:30.374
So you're saying
I'm a man?

19:30.670 --> 19:31.876
Oh, you...

19:32.838 --> 19:34.954
are all man.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.588
(LAUGHS) Mmm.
Mmm.

19:39.929 --> 19:40.794
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

19:42.348 --> 19:43.133
ALEX: Hey-o!

19:44.475 --> 19:45.135
Damn it!
(SETS DOWN GLASS)

19:45.434 --> 19:46.674
It's just you guys.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.184
What? We're here
to support you.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.767
Yeah, it can't be easy to
start a new gay subculture

19:52.066 --> 19:53.477
with one day's notice
and, knowing you,

19:53.776 --> 19:55.517
a completely bungled
marketing strategy.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.027
| put an add
in The Sacramento Bee.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.279
Looks like we got here
just in time.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.314
Your banner's crooked.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.983
Let's do this, bro.
Yeah.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.196
Ha-ha!

20:05.496 --> 20:07.533
Excuse me.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.368
Is this Optimistic
Red-Velvet Walrus Night?

20:10.710 --> 20:11.370
Oh.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.543
Yeah.

20:14.839 --> 20:15.419
Yes, it is.
Great.

20:16.424 --> 20:17.835
What is that?

20:18.134 --> 20:19.966
Well, I don't know.
(LAUGHS) I made it up.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.046
Why would you
come, then?

20:21.345 --> 20:22.631
| don't know.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.886
| don't really fit
into those other categories,

20:24.181 --> 20:24.670
so I thought
I'd give this one a shot.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.515
I'm Max.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.551
I'm Alan.
Awesome.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.811
Alan. That's cool.
That's a good name.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.517
Guys!

20:33.816 --> 20:37.229
That might be an
optimistic red-velvet walrus.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.439
Oh, man,
this place is empty.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.730
But I'll bet it's all
gonna work out.

20:42.032 --> 20:42.897
Ha-ha-ha!

20:48.372 --> 20:50.534
Okay, let's do this.
What's my gay category?

20:50.833 --> 20:52.665
Okay. (SIGHS)
You're a twink,

20:52.960 --> 20:54.621
but I've seen you eat,
SO you're a sloppy twink,

20:54.920 --> 20:56.251
which is not as much fun
as it sounds. ALEX: Mmm.

20:56.547 --> 20:59.005
Penny, you drink a lot,
you are really loud,

20:59.300 --> 21:00.882
and you have a lot of
embarrassing stories about dating?

21:01.177 --> 21:02.713
Bitch, you are a hag!

21:03.012 --> 21:04.343
Well, I used to be a beard,
so I'll take that as a win.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.504
(LAUGHS)
| thought I was a hag.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.842
Nope. You're a top,
plain and simple.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.132
Damn right I am.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.641
Oh! I know what I am.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.552
| am a scruffy power bottom,

21:12.855 --> 21:15.472
because I have a goatee
and I do lots of glute exercises.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.561
Your reasoning is wrong,
but your conclusion is correct.

21:17.860 --> 21:18.895
<i>Do met!
(LAUGHING) Do me!</i>

21:19.195 --> 21:21.106
Oh, would that I could.
(LAUGHS)

21:21.405 --> 21:22.691
Would that |
freaking could.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.028
Um...

21:26.327 --> 21:27.783
Damn! Damn!
Aah! Aah!

21:28.078 --> 21:28.488
Oh!
Damn! Damn!
