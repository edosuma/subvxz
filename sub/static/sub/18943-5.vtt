00:01.559 --> 00:04.849
(Simon) So you're killing Carol,
shagging Penny

00:04.919 --> 00:08.679
- and marrying Clare.
- Why the fuck would you marry Clare?

00:08.679 --> 00:11.899
- Cos she earns more than me.
- Your turn. Oi!

00:13.879 --> 00:15.999
Do you wanna play this or not?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.520
- Sorry, is it my round?
- (Simon) Of the game.

00:18.520 --> 00:21.520
How about Bob, JP and me?

00:22.440 --> 00:25.879
- We have to do what, exactly?
- You don't have to do anything.

00:25.879 --> 00:29.680
Jenny chooses who she'd shag,
who she'd kill, who she'd marry.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.400
- Ah, I'm with you.
- (Simon) Too easy, this one.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.839
- Bob, obviously, I'd kill.
- Obviously.

00:34.839 --> 00:38.079
- And you can't shag JP, so...
- (Jenny) Why not?

00:38.079 --> 00:40.920
Cos he wouldn't like it
very much, would he?

00:40.920 --> 00:42.919
He couldn't do it, not with a woman.

00:42.919 --> 00:45.280
I'm sure he'd make an exception
in your case.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.430
- (Giggling)
- Oi. Are you shagging me or JP?

00:49.640 --> 00:51.439
Neither.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.518
I'm going home to shag Alec.

00:53.519 --> 00:55.559
Want to come with us in the car?

00:55.559 --> 00:58.239
I might have one more.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.240
I can give you a backie on my bike.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.318
Well, maybe two or three.

01:04.319 --> 01:07.319
- OK. See you later.
- Bye.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.560
See ya.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.759
Tell me I was never like that with Peter.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.080
You were never like that with Peter.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.719
- (Brian) Like what?
- Well...

01:18.720 --> 01:21.639
All over each other being, you know...

01:21.640 --> 01:24.079
- nauseating.
- Who's nauseating?

01:24.080 --> 01:26.999
Alec is and Jenny's on her way.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.239
It's one of the rules
of being in a relationship.

01:30.239 --> 01:33.239
- What is?
- Turning into a tosser.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.080
Unless you're a tosser to start off with.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.879
It was great when
it was just me and Jenny.

01:38.879 --> 01:42.359
So is it Alec you don't like,
or having to share the flat?

01:42.359 --> 01:44.599
It's what he's doing to Jenny.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.100
(Kurt) Shagging her.

01:46.799 --> 01:48.839
Turning her into a twat.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.878
She's not a twat.

01:50.879 --> 01:53.079
Never has been, never will.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.118
Wasn't when I shagged her.

01:55.119 --> 01:59.389
You don't think that was
the twattiest thing she's ever done?

02:03.240 --> 02:04.959
No.

Just lager. Would you like some?

04:19.600 --> 04:22.600
Yeah, thanks.

04:37.679 --> 04:40.679

want to go to bed.

04:49.519 --> 04:52.398
We're not.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.878

- Me?

05:02.879 --> 05:04.919

Alec thought you might have felt
a bit excluded last night

05:26.320 --> 05:28.639
- when we went off.
- No.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.640
He thought he might have
upset you again.

05:31.759 --> 05:35.399
- What do you mean, again?
- He's worried about you.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.679
Well, he shouldn't be,
I'm none of his business.

05:38.679 --> 05:40.999
- Don't get defensive.
- Who's defensive?

05:40.999 --> 05:43.798
I'm just saying I'm happy. I'm fine.

Food poisoning, if she asks.

05:57.599 --> 05:59.599
Alec's got the day off.

Yeah, and you talk about them
all the time.

Someone out of hospital.

Sounds great.
We should go there one night.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.760

(Brian) You know where
you're going wrong?

08:20.400 --> 08:23.199
(Susan) Do tell me (!)
(Brian) Your attitude.

08:23.199 --> 08:27.600
- You need your own space too much.
- Hang on, let me write this down.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.080
You're always dishing it out
but you can't take it.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.080
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

08:34.999 --> 08:36.499
- Go on, then.
- OK.

08:37.039 --> 08:40.440
Look at me and Kurt.
We're much more relaxed than you.

08:40.440 --> 08:44.080
- That's why we're happier.
- Our flat is an open house.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.918
Er, open flat.

08:45.919 --> 08:49.680
Last night, for instance -
JP turns up with some bloke,

08:49.680 --> 08:52.680
- do we bat an eyelid?
- No.

08:52.919 --> 08:55.000
Did they grope each other on the sofa?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.599
They might have done,
if Kurt hadn't upset the boyfriend.

08:58.599 --> 09:02.239
- I didn't upset anyone.
- Then why did he run away?

09:02.239 --> 09:05.239
I told you, he just decided to go.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.438
Must've been a reason.

09:07.439 --> 09:09.279
He was tired.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.599
- Could've kipped on the floor.
- He didn't want to.

09:12.599 --> 09:15.599
Why not? That's my question.

09:16.759 --> 09:18.839
Another thing, she's bunking off.

09:18.839 --> 09:22.999
Jenny's pretending she's ill
so she can stay in bed with Alec.

09:22.999 --> 09:25.038
- Nice.
- "Nice"?

09:25.039 --> 09:27.399
Is that all you've got to say?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.840
Yeah.

09:28.840 --> 09:32.079
This isn't how Jenny behaves,
not the old Jenny.

09:32.079 --> 09:35.319
- I never liked the old Jenny.
- You fancied her.

09:35.319 --> 09:38.880
Yeah, but if the new Jenny's
got the old Jenny's arse

09:38.880 --> 09:41.199
then I think I prefer the new Jenny.

09:41.199 --> 09:43.359
- (Clapping)
- Morning, everyone!

09:43.359 --> 09:46.840

Miss Paige is off sick.

09:46.840 --> 09:51.560
A cover plan has been drawn up
for the relevant staff to take on board.

09:51.560 --> 09:55.759
We're under strength
so it's all hands on deck. Any questions?

09:55.759 --> 09:58.769
- Looks good to me.
- Excellent! Thank you.

09:58.919 --> 10:01.719
- Shit.
- Still prefer the new Jenny?

10:01.720 --> 10:04.720
(Clare) Susan!

10:05.320 --> 10:08.320
Jenny's food poisoning - is it very bad?

10:10.720 --> 10:14.850
She didn't get much sleep.
I... I could hear her all night.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.359
Both ends, I think.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.360
Poor Jenny.

10:23.799 --> 10:27.520
Seen how many classes I'm doing
just so Alec can fuck her brains out?

10:27.520 --> 10:30.800
- So crap at lying to Clare.
- Yeah, I'm really good.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.879
- Should say something to Jenny.
- What about?

10:33.879 --> 10:36.839
About how I feel about Alec.
I should tell her, I suppose.

10:36.839 --> 10:38.598
Course you should.

10:38.599 --> 10:41.679
When me and Kurt
have a problem, we talk about it.

10:41.679 --> 10:43.719
- No, we don't.
- Yeah.

10:43.720 --> 10:47.119
- Like that business with your duvet?
- What business?

10:47.119 --> 10:49.720
When it started to stink,
I got you to sort it out.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.840
- No.
- You took it down the cleaners.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.840
- No, I didn't.

- It better not.

- I hate lying.
- I hate doing this much cover.

11:03.199 --> 11:06.800
What if he moves in, pushes me out,
takes over the flat?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.839
- He won't.
- Are you sure?

11:08.840 --> 11:10.358
No.

11:10.359 --> 11:13.359
Shit.

11:16.799 --> 11:19.439
- Carol.

11:19.440 --> 11:24.120
I've just checked my timetable
and my cover for Jenny is a bit tricky.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.120
Can you ask Clare to find someone else?

11:27.199 --> 11:29.239
You can ask her yourself.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.960
She's in there, just waiting
for someone to spoil her day.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.998
I haven't got time right now.

11:34.999 --> 11:38.000
- Well, later then.
- I wish I could but...

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Thanks, Carol.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
She's walking all over you.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.720
- Don't mind.
- Well, you should mind.

- Sorry.

12:05.679 --> 12:09.249
Mmm. Says, erm,
she can't cover Miss Paige's class.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.950
- Can you find somebody else?
- Course I can't. You tell Penny...

12:17.359 --> 12:20.280

at the start of the day

12:20.280 --> 12:23.280
and that's what she's going to do!

12:27.840 --> 12:30.639
(Quietly) That's what she said.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.640
Well, thanks very much.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.280
Hangovers a few times.
Once when I couldn't be arsed.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.570
- But never to stay at home and shag.
- I wish.

12:45.039 --> 12:47.720
(Penny) Simon, could I ask a big favour?

12:47.720 --> 12:51.559
I'm supposed to take
Jenny's sixth form group this afternoon.

12:51.559 --> 12:55.280
- Any chance you could do it?
- I've got three of her lessons

12:55.280 --> 12:57.238
plus gate monitoring.

12:57.239 --> 12:59.279
- So that's a no.
- Sorry.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.960
Don't worry about
the sixth form, piece of piss.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.600
- But I don't know any of them.
- You must know Tanya.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.799
First thing she says, disagree.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.280

the others'll join in.

to get some photocopies.

13:18.479 --> 13:21.769
- You're probably right.
- Of course I'm right.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.960
And you warned her.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.038
I am actually here.

13:27.039 --> 13:28.878
We know you're here.

13:28.879 --> 13:31.879
Don't talk about me, I'm in the room.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.600
She doesn't want us talking
like she's not in the room.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.678
Right.

13:38.679 --> 13:42.760
You warned her about Penny
cos you didn't want her getting hurt?

13:42.760 --> 13:45.760
Of course.

13:50.799 --> 13:54.039
- What's wrong with Miss Paige?
- She's not here.

13:54.039 --> 13:57.200
- Is she away all week?
- Do I look like a doctor?

13:57.200 --> 13:58.799
Yes.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.370
So have you read this book?
Well, it's shit, innit?

14:03.600 --> 14:05.639
I wouldn't call it shit.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.759
So you have read it?

14:07.760 --> 14:10.760
A while ago.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.119
You know Lockwood's dream?

14:13.120 --> 14:15.159
Which one?

14:15.160 --> 14:18.359
When the ghost comes back
to Wuthering Heights.

14:18.359 --> 14:19.999
Yes.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
What's that all about, then?

14:23.919 --> 14:26.399
Can you open your books and read?

14:26.400 --> 14:30.040
Miss Paige said Heathcliff's
a bit like Richard Ill.

14:30.479 --> 14:32.518
- I can see that.
- Why?

14:32.519 --> 14:34.360
Did Heathcliff have a hump as well?

14:34.360 --> 14:36.239
(Tittering)

14:36.240 --> 14:39.240
Just read the book.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.239
(Simon) At least you'll
get a good night's sleep.

14:44.239 --> 14:46.400
- Will I?
- They'll be shagged out by now.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.919
They're never shagged out.
I think they're into Tantric sex.

14:49.919 --> 14:54.000
- (Brian) When you piss on each other?
- No, you shag for hours without coming.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.880
- What's the point of that?
- Sex becomes a sacrament of love.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.198
- Oh?
- (Simon) Sting does it.

15:00.199 --> 15:04.189
- I'm off. Want a backie?
- Please don't make me go home.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.919
Why not?
Can't deal with the happy couple?

15:07.919 --> 15:10.799
You haven't got a life
and nobody loves you?

15:10.799 --> 15:13.160
Yes, it makes me feel exactly like you.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.918
If you're that bothered, talk to Jenny.

15:15.919 --> 15:19.839
Good idea. "Hello, Jenny,
could you chuck your boyfriend

15:19.880 --> 15:23.280
"so I can get some sleep?"
That would go down well.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.400
- Talk to Alec, then.
- "Evening, Alec,

15:25.400 --> 15:28.760
"I think you're a tosser.
Piss off out of this flat."

15:28.760 --> 15:30.519
Could be a bit more subtle.

15:30.519 --> 15:33.119
You're about to tell me how to be subtle?

15:33.119 --> 15:37.439
What's next? Is Kurt going
to give me tips on how to get laid?

15:37.439 --> 15:40.319
- I was only trying to help.
- Well, you didn't.

15:40.319 --> 15:43.199
- You can stay at ours.
- Can I?

15:43.200 --> 15:45.238
- Can I?
- No chance.

15:45.239 --> 15:48.239
Full up, mate.

15:49.799 --> 15:51.678
Enter.

15:51.679 --> 15:54.679
(Kurt) ..I wish.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.159
- Hi.
- (Brian) Evenin'.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.160
Hello.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.758
Vince!

16:02.759 --> 16:05.038
You came back.

16:05.039 --> 16:08.679
Hiya, Vince. (Laughs)
This is Vince, JP's boyfriend!

16:08.840 --> 16:11.758
- He's not my...
- Vince, this is Susan.

16:11.759 --> 16:14.279
- Susan's another teacher.
- Is she?

16:14.280 --> 16:17.570
I hope you don't mind
if Vince stays the night.

16:19.519 --> 16:21.078
Fantastic.

16:21.079 --> 16:23.038
They're gonna have sex.

16:23.039 --> 16:25.960
- (Gasps) Do you think so?
- Fucking nightmare.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.918
I thought you loved
having people to stay.

16:28.919 --> 16:30.839
Not when they shag outside my room.

16:30.839 --> 16:33.839
- I'll go in your room.
- Will you?

16:33.959 --> 16:36.959
Mm. I'm used to noisy neighbours.

16:36.999 --> 16:39.999
Hang on, where are you gonna sleep?

16:43.679 --> 16:45.959
Do you want the light off?

16:45.960 --> 16:48.960
I'm OK.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.720
Can you hear anything?

16:58.559 --> 17:01.438
No.

17:01.439 --> 17:03.479
Maybe they've gone to sleep.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.637
Yeah, right.

17:05.638 --> 17:08.638
Why don't you go and have a look?

17:09.199 --> 17:11.919
You always used to
with Simon and Maggie.

17:11.919 --> 17:13.958
She was a woman.

17:13.959 --> 17:16.880
I'm not gonna go
and watch two blokes, am I?

17:16.880 --> 17:20.660
- Aren't you?
- Do you think I'm some kind of pervert?

17:30.880 --> 17:33.880
(Springs creaking faintly)

17:36.800 --> 17:39.318
(Groaning)

17:39.319 --> 17:42.319
(Moaning and creaking)

17:46.079 --> 17:49.079
(Creaking and moaning continue)

17:54.480 --> 17:57.480
(Heavy breathing)

18:04.240 --> 18:07.240
(JP laughs)

18:13.799 --> 18:15.839
- Brian.
- What the fuck?

18:15.840 --> 18:18.920
- What did I do?
- Can I sleep here as well?

18:18.959 --> 18:21.879
Here?

18:21.880 --> 18:24.880
(Kurt) In this bed?

18:28.960 --> 18:31.960
Hey-hey. My first threesome.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.999
Mine too. I was hoping for two women.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.679
What's wrong with my room? Too noisy?

18:38.680 --> 18:40.719
You don't wanna know.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.720
No, we don't.

18:47.880 --> 18:50.120
Did you notice what they were doing?

18:50.120 --> 18:52.919
Funnily enough, I didn't stop to watch.

18:52.920 --> 18:57.799
Is this what it's like at your place,
having to listen to sex all night?

18:57.799 --> 19:01.199
It's not just the nights,
it's every evening, every morning.

19:01.199 --> 19:02.879
All day at the weekends.

19:07.959 --> 19:10.918
- I feel a bit trapped.
- Get used to it.

19:10.919 --> 19:14.560
If Vince is anything like Alec,
this is just the start.

19:14.560 --> 19:18.760
Forget sleep, forget getting
into the bathroom when you want

19:18.760 --> 19:21.440
and wave goodbye to your fruit and veg.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.718
- You what?
- Sex toys.

19:23.719 --> 19:26.598
If it's not overripe it's up for grabs.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.919
If it's so bad at Jenny's,
why don't you move out?

19:29.919 --> 19:33.399
It's not easy to find
the right person to share with.

19:33.399 --> 19:36.158
There's other people apart from Simon.

19:36.159 --> 19:40.359
It was working really well with Jenny
until Alec came along.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.679
Do you think that
now Vince has come along

19:43.680 --> 19:45.959
it'll stop working for us and JP?

19:45.959 --> 19:47.999
I wouldn't be surprised.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
(Distant siren)

19:53.720 --> 19:55.959
- Where are you going?
- I need a piss.

19:55.959 --> 19:58.639
You can't leave me alone here with him.

19:58.639 --> 20:01.639
I'll be two minutes.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.598
Hmm.

20:08.599 --> 20:11.889
- Two minutes, eh?
- Don't even think about it.

20:20.519 --> 20:23.519
Ahh.

20:23.559 --> 20:26.559
Morning.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.639
- Is Vince in the bathroom?
- No, he's gone.

20:30.639 --> 20:33.038
Morning. Sleep well?

20:33.039 --> 20:35.959
- Not bad. You?
- Hmm, not so good.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.838
Coffee?

20:37.839 --> 20:40.839
So, er, do you think you and Vince...

20:42.519 --> 20:45.519
Do you think...?

20:45.840 --> 20:47.879
Is he coming back tonight?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.639
- Be very surprised.
- (Kurt) Did you have a row?

20:50.639 --> 20:53.000
- No.
- So you'll be seeing him again.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.359
- Nah.
- (Kurt) Why not?

20:55.360 --> 20:58.119
- He's not really my type.
- But you shagged him.

20:58.119 --> 21:01.119
Or he shagged you. We didn't see.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.079
Sorry about the sleeping arrangements,

21:07.079 --> 21:09.999
I didn't realise Susan was gonna be here.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.679
We didn't know
Vince was gonna be here.

21:12.679 --> 21:15.799
Maybe we should have a rule,
before we bring someone back

21:15.799 --> 21:18.240
we should get the others' permission.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.240
Fine by me. Banana?

21:23.319 --> 21:26.319
- I won't, actually.
- Nah.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.879

21:29.880 --> 21:33.310

22:27.240 --> 22:30.119
- Meaning?
- Oh, nothing.

22:30.120 --> 22:33.200
I had food poisoning.
Didn't Susan tell you?

22:33.399 --> 22:35.438
Yeah. No. Sorry.

22:35.439 --> 22:37.719
She didn't come home last night.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.599
- She stayed with us.
- In the same bed.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.278
- Really?
- We didn't shag her.

22:43.279 --> 22:44.838
No.

22:44.839 --> 22:47.439
It was just cos the flat was a bit full.

22:47.439 --> 22:50.359
It won't happen again
cos we've got a new rule.

22:50.359 --> 22:54.880
If we want to bring someone back
we have to ask the other two first.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.639
Maybe you should have a rule.

22:56.639 --> 23:00.629
What for? It's my flat.
I don't need anyone's permission.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.760
And I can't imagine you'll need
to ask permission very often.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.840
- (Kurt) What do you mean?
- (Echoing laugh)

23:20.000 --> 23:21.400
(Clare) Jenny!

23:21.400 --> 23:23.198
You're back.

23:23.199 --> 23:27.559
Sorry about yesterday. I think
it was some undercooked chicken.

23:27.559 --> 23:31.409
With some people food poisoning
usually means hangover.

23:32.399 --> 23:35.519
Not in your case, though.
Take it gently today.

23:35.519 --> 23:38.519
You still look a bit peaky.

23:43.999 --> 23:45.839
What?

23:45.840 --> 23:49.060
Look, every department
has to do one assembly.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.599
- But poetry?
- Have you got a better idea?

23:52.599 --> 23:56.120
When do we organise it?
We're already overstretched.

23:56.120 --> 23:59.639
If someone decides
to take the day off we're stuffed.

23:59.639 --> 24:02.789
- How are you, by the way?
- Fine. Thank you.

24:02.799 --> 24:05.718
You can walk
without too much discomfort?

24:05.719 --> 24:07.799
- Wasn't it food poisoning?
- It was.

24:07.799 --> 24:10.879
- And thank you for covering me.
- Pleasure.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.080
Maybe you can leave some work
to hand out next time.

24:14.080 --> 24:17.790
- I think I'd better.
- What's that supposed to mean?

24:17.840 --> 24:20.840
- Nothing.
- If you've something to say...

24:21.080 --> 24:24.360
- I wasn't talking about you.
- You were talking about me?

24:24.360 --> 24:28.140
- What did I do wrong?
- Nothing, really. It's just...

24:28.799 --> 24:31.880
Some of the sixth form
are worried about Wuthering Heights.

24:31.880 --> 24:35.279
They could've done with
a discussion about the text

24:35.279 --> 24:37.639
rather than being told to read it again.

24:37.639 --> 24:39.720
- They said that?
- I'm only...

24:39.720 --> 24:43.039
- This is so unfair.
- Not your fault she was in bed.

24:43.039 --> 24:45.439
I had no time to prepare.
I was up to my neck

24:45.439 --> 24:49.199
and I'm expected to look after kids
I don't even know.

24:49.199 --> 24:52.319
- What was I supposed to do?
- I'm sure you did your best.

24:52.319 --> 24:54.799
- And Simon wouldn't help me.
- What?

24:54.799 --> 24:56.558
What?

24:56.559 --> 24:59.399
- I asked him to help me...
- To take the class!

24:59.399 --> 25:02.960
He told me to fuck off
and I tried to keep everyone happy.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.960
- What are you playing at?
- I was covering other lessons!

25:05.960 --> 25:08.970
You don't just let an NQT
fend for herself!

25:09.599 --> 25:11.879
It's all right, it's OK, don't worry.

25:11.879 --> 25:14.879
That's it. I'll talk to you later.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.760
- You all right?
- Yeah.

25:22.319 --> 25:26.079
If only you had tits like Penny,
you'd never get bollocked again.

25:26.079 --> 25:28.398
I'm sorry you had so much cover.

25:28.399 --> 25:30.439
I was really ill.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.278
No, you weren't,
you were shagging Alec.

25:33.279 --> 25:36.440
- Susan told you.
- Doesn't matter who told me,

25:36.440 --> 25:40.159
I had to work my arse off while you
were in bed with your boyfriend.

25:40.159 --> 25:44.600
Now I get bollocked by Bob but why
should you care, you had loads of sex!

25:44.600 --> 25:47.600
- Still not getting any?
- That's not the point.

25:47.600 --> 25:51.199
What is the point?
For once you had to make an effort?

25:51.199 --> 25:53.359
- I'm not allowed to bunk off?
- No.

25:53.359 --> 25:57.199
I preferred sex to English with Tanya.
Is that so strange?

25:57.199 --> 26:00.199
In your case, yes.

26:05.639 --> 26:07.678
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

26:07.679 --> 26:11.400
Lying about what I said
or getting me bollocked by Bob?

26:11.400 --> 26:13.439
- Both.
- Oh, that's OK, then.

26:13.439 --> 26:16.239
- We can't leave it like this.
- Why not?

26:16.239 --> 26:19.079
I can't bear it when someone hates me.

26:19.080 --> 26:22.078
You should've thought of that before.

26:22.079 --> 26:25.079
Please, Simon, I... said I was sorry.

26:27.239 --> 26:30.249
- (Sniffs)
- You're not... crying, are you?

26:31.519 --> 26:34.078
Oh, shit.

26:34.079 --> 26:37.079
- I'm sorry.
- You too?

26:38.040 --> 26:41.040
What?

26:44.920 --> 26:48.079
- She's faking it.
- No, she was really crying,

26:48.079 --> 26:51.239
- there was snot and everything.
- She's good.

26:51.239 --> 26:53.519
I was pretty pissed off with her.

26:53.519 --> 26:55.758
(Sighs) She's faking it.

26:55.759 --> 26:57.879
- How can you tell?
- I can tell.

26:57.879 --> 27:01.449
Couple of tears, men like you -
putty in her hands.

27:05.959 --> 27:07.400
Those for me?

27:07.400 --> 27:10.119
Guess how many people
have asked me that?

27:10.119 --> 27:11.960
If I guess can I keep them?

27:11.960 --> 27:14.600
Only if you're Miss Paige. Is she here?

27:14.600 --> 27:16.799
- Nope.
- Are those for me?

27:16.800 --> 27:19.518
It was seven, now it's nine.

27:19.519 --> 27:22.318
- They're for Jenny.
- Who from?

27:22.319 --> 27:25.319
Oh, there's a card in a sealed envelope.

27:26.479 --> 27:29.839
However, as I was making
Pot Noodle at the time,

27:29.919 --> 27:32.599
steam wafted towards the envelope...

27:32.600 --> 27:34.318
Alec?

27:34.319 --> 27:37.319
There's no name,
just half a dozen kisses.

27:41.760 --> 27:45.260
"Friday night, 7:30,
dinner at Berto's, red dress,

27:45.279 --> 27:48.159
"no knickers."

27:48.160 --> 27:50.119
He's very concise.

27:50.120 --> 27:53.279
Is that what you call it?
I'd say overbearing.

27:53.279 --> 27:56.279
Yeah, maybe you're right.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.839
Those for me?

27:58.840 --> 28:01.840
Yes.

28:03.239 --> 28:05.439
- No card?
- Not that I can see.

28:05.439 --> 28:08.439
Oh. Aren't they lovely?

28:09.320 --> 28:12.320
- Let's put them in water.
- Lovely.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.760
Did you tell Simon that I wasn't really ill?

28:21.879 --> 28:24.519
Shit. Sorry. It just slipped out.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.680
- But Clare doesn't know.
- God, no.

28:26.680 --> 28:30.250
I told her you were chucking up
all over the place.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.760
The thing is, am I gonna
have to lie like that a lot?

28:36.760 --> 28:40.120
- I don't mind now and again.
- Sorry. I know...

28:40.520 --> 28:42.759
I know it was a bit awkward for you

28:42.759 --> 28:46.599
but Alec wanted the day off
and wanted to spend it with me.

28:46.599 --> 28:50.680
He must have known you can't
drop everything when you want to.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.679
He knew it was awkward
for a couple of people

28:53.679 --> 28:55.720
but he thought it was worth it.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.880
Yeah, but what if you'd said no?

28:57.880 --> 29:01.720
What if you'd explained that
your colleagues would struggle

29:01.720 --> 29:03.760
and you couldn't let THEM down

29:03.760 --> 29:06.280
because HE wanted
to have sex with YOU?

29:06.280 --> 29:09.280
Are you trying to make
some kind of point?

29:10.799 --> 29:13.520
(Susan) He's a control freak.
(Simon) She is.

29:13.520 --> 29:18.200
She used to be but he's taken over
and she can't see what he's doing.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.478
And that's... bad?

29:20.479 --> 29:23.079
Of course it's bad.

29:23.080 --> 29:25.239
I'm only looking out for my friend.

29:25.239 --> 29:27.960
There's a fine line
between looking out for

29:27.960 --> 29:31.240
and sticking your nose in
cos you don't like her boyfriend.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.600
Jenny needs someone
to show her what's going on.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.759
And that someone would be...

29:37.760 --> 29:40.760
Me.

29:45.359 --> 29:47.399
How about I cook Sunday lunch?

29:47.399 --> 29:49.989
- When?
- Erm, I was thinking Sunday.

29:51.119 --> 29:54.119
- No, I mean which Sunday?
- You choose.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.719
I'll have to ask Alec.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.399
Why?

29:59.400 --> 30:01.438
He might have plans.

30:01.439 --> 30:05.199
But if you've got plans
then his plans will have to change.

30:05.199 --> 30:07.879
- It doesn't work like that.
- Since when?

30:07.879 --> 30:09.518
Sorry?

30:09.519 --> 30:14.139
You used to decide things for yourself,
you didn't ask permission.

30:14.319 --> 30:17.539
- It's not permission.
- Sounds like it to me.

30:24.760 --> 30:27.159
How about a drink later?

30:27.160 --> 30:29.198
Sure. Why not?

30:29.199 --> 30:31.240
Do you want to check with Alec?

30:31.240 --> 30:32.998
No.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.038
He's staying up in London.

30:35.039 --> 30:37.480
OK if I bring someone back tonight?

30:37.480 --> 30:40.078
You only chucked Vince this morning.

30:40.079 --> 30:44.280
- You can't chuck a one-night stand.
- It's happened to me a few times.

30:44.280 --> 30:48.200
- So is that OK, then?
- I might get lucky this evening.

30:49.559 --> 30:52.559
No, but seriously.

31:00.040 --> 31:03.040
Hiya. I just wondered if...

31:03.080 --> 31:05.118
No!

31:05.119 --> 31:08.119
I was talking to Carol.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.600
Any chance of...
a couple of photocopies?

31:14.600 --> 31:17.600
Of each page? There's only about 20.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.158
(Mouths)

31:20.159 --> 31:22.359
- What?
- You heard her!

31:22.360 --> 31:25.360
Actually I didn't.

31:26.399 --> 31:30.079
Maybe Carol didn't tell you,
or maybe you didn't hear her,

31:30.079 --> 31:33.859
but we don't provide
a photocopying service for staff.

31:34.039 --> 31:36.278
I don't have time to do this.

31:36.279 --> 31:37.889
Do I look as if I care?

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
- Please, couldn't you...
- No!

31:45.720 --> 31:48.720
Oh, that's it. Blub, blub, blub.

31:52.559 --> 31:54.078
Ah!

31:54.079 --> 31:57.079
(Blows nose noisily)

31:58.239 --> 32:01.239
OK, who's this?

32:02.200 --> 32:06.920
Three years at Loughborough
and I still can't spell "physiotherapy".

32:06.920 --> 32:08.958
- Is that me?
- "Is that me?"

32:08.959 --> 32:10.999
- Is it?
- Course it is.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.638
OK, who's this?

32:12.639 --> 32:16.079
We've run out of tissues
cos I've been wanking all night.

32:16.079 --> 32:18.759
- Nothing like me.
- You knew it was you.

32:18.759 --> 32:20.640
- No.
- (Simon) Who's this?

32:20.640 --> 32:23.999
Don't cry, Penny.
Just put your head on my shoulder

32:23.999 --> 32:26.079
and your hand there. That's it.

32:26.079 --> 32:29.239
- Just a bit lower.
- Why's everyone doing me?!

32:29.239 --> 32:31.598
It was Bob.

32:31.599 --> 32:33.838
Not bad.

32:33.839 --> 32:36.839
You do someone. Not me!

32:37.240 --> 32:40.240
Right.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.198
Look at my massive cock.

32:43.199 --> 32:45.118
I said not me!

32:45.119 --> 32:48.899
(Susan) I'm a new man,
in touch with my feminine side.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.759
I'm a sex god.

32:51.760 --> 32:54.200
- It's Alec.
- I'm a control freak.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.200
- Yep. I got it.
- I'm a big fucking...

32:58.519 --> 33:01.038
tosser.

33:01.039 --> 33:04.039
Oh, dear. (Chuckles)

33:06.200 --> 33:09.200
How about another drink. Hmm?

33:10.119 --> 33:12.360
- I'll see what's in the fridge.
- Hi.

33:12.360 --> 33:16.520
- (Jenny) What are you doing here?
- Got the last train after all.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.558
(♪ One Dimension: Simian)

33:18.559 --> 33:21.159
♪ I see the world in one dimension... ♪

33:21.159 --> 33:25.149
(JP) Everybody says it was the best.
You had to be there.

33:26.399 --> 33:29.399
You're a woman.

33:29.839 --> 33:31.878
Brian teaches PE.

33:31.879 --> 33:34.879
(Brian) And geography.

33:34.919 --> 33:37.279

34:00.999 --> 34:03.158
Fuck off.

34:03.159 --> 34:04.839
I can't stay in my room.

34:05.199 --> 34:08.199
There's too much noise.

34:13.759 --> 34:16.759
- What kind of noise?
- Giggling.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.197
I think they're telling jokes.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.239
Are they in bed?

34:21.239 --> 34:23.438
Yeah. Think they're gonna have sex?

34:23.438 --> 34:26.938
- How can they if he's gay?
- Maybe he's bisexual.

34:27.360 --> 34:30.360
- Lucky bastard.
- How's that lucky?

34:30.600 --> 34:32.998
He can shag anyone.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
Oh.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.560
Budge up.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.040
- You set the alarm?
- Yeah.

34:53.159 --> 34:56.159
(Kurt) Night, then.
(Brian) Night-night.

35:19.080 --> 35:22.580
- She's gone.
- Can I ask you a personal question?

35:22.920 --> 35:25.920
- What about?
- You and what's-her-name.

35:26.719 --> 35:29.719
- Did you, er...? You know.
- Shag her?

35:30.760 --> 35:32.999
- Yes.
- What do you think?

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
I don't know, that's why I'm asking.

35:36.279 --> 35:38.599
I'm bent.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.638
Of course I didn't shag her.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.639
OK. So you'd never shag a woman?

35:45.159 --> 35:47.279
Even if she looked like a bloke?

35:47.279 --> 35:49.480
Especially then. I'm not a lesbian.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.980
No, I know you're not.
But if you were bisexual...

35:54.479 --> 35:57.629
- I did try and shag a woman once.
- Did you?

35:57.919 --> 36:00.238
Would you like to talk about it?

36:00.239 --> 36:03.239
- Would you?
- I've got time.

36:04.600 --> 36:09.319
Nothing much to tell really. I was 15,
average age to lose your virginity.

36:09.319 --> 36:12.119
- 15?
- I wouldn't admit I was gay then

36:12.120 --> 36:15.340
so Sandra Pope
was my first proper girlfriend.

36:15.439 --> 36:18.440
The only trouble was,
I couldn't, you know...

36:18.440 --> 36:21.278
Get it up.

36:21.279 --> 36:23.359
- Enjoy myself.
- Oh.

36:23.360 --> 36:26.839
While we were doing it
I felt like something was wrong

36:26.839 --> 36:31.669
so after about 20 minutes I said,
"This isn't for me." So we stopped.

36:35.400 --> 36:38.400
20 minutes.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.280
(Door opening)

36:53.280 --> 36:55.998
Morning.

36:55.999 --> 36:57.639
Jenny...

36:57.640 --> 37:00.640
(Door slams)

37:21.919 --> 37:24.560
I'm making scrambled eggs
if you're hungry.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.560
Coffee's fine.

37:31.800 --> 37:34.800
Sit down, I think we need to talk.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.880
- Do we?
- Yes.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.399
Please.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.400
Sit.

37:53.160 --> 37:56.160
This isn't easy, is it? Being here.

37:56.439 --> 37:59.439
- At this table?
- In this flat.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.910
I don't remember
the last time I had so much fun.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.239
I'm trying to help.

38:05.240 --> 38:08.199
Well, I wouldn't bother. Really.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.398
I'd like to.

38:10.399 --> 38:11.918
Hang on.

38:11.919 --> 38:15.139
Did I book a therapy session
this morning? No.

38:15.159 --> 38:17.839
Susan, please.

38:17.840 --> 38:21.880
I don't understand why my being
with Jenny is such a problem.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.880
Don't you? Oh, well.

38:25.199 --> 38:28.199
Never mind.

38:28.799 --> 38:31.160
Why can't you just deal with this?

38:31.160 --> 38:32.559
I can.

38:32.559 --> 38:35.158
By getting drunk and slagging me off?

38:35.159 --> 38:39.849
- How will that solve anything?
- Getting drunk solves most things.

38:39.999 --> 38:42.079
Why are you avoiding the issue?

38:42.079 --> 38:45.509
Why are you stopping me
from leaving the kitchen?

38:46.960 --> 38:49.960
Me and Jenny, we're not gonna split up.

38:50.280 --> 38:53.280
Oh.

38:53.519 --> 38:56.519
Fuck off.

39:01.280 --> 39:04.238
You're very hostile.

39:04.239 --> 39:07.720
If he thinks that was hostile
he's in for a shock.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.220
- He's not that bad.
- He's a total, utter wanker.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.120
- But what you said in the pub.
- What?

39:14.120 --> 39:17.120
You don't think maybe
you went a bit far?

39:19.920 --> 39:22.079
You've got no idea, have you?

39:22.080 --> 39:24.839
What it's like for me
living there with them.

39:24.839 --> 39:27.799
Every night. The groping, the noise.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.038
You've got no fucking idea!

39:30.039 --> 39:33.039
See, I don't mind the kissing in public.

39:33.119 --> 39:34.958
You wouldn't.

39:34.959 --> 39:38.119
Why don't you just deal with it
like a grown-up?

39:38.119 --> 39:40.719
- I'm sorry?
- Do what me and Brian did.

39:40.719 --> 39:43.880
We had a problem with JP,
so we made up our rule.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.519
And you think that's grown-up,
to make up some silly rule

39:47.519 --> 39:51.480
about asking everyone
if it's OK to bring a little friend home?

39:51.480 --> 39:53.838
You really think that's grown-up?

39:53.839 --> 39:56.839
Yes.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.518
(Scoffs)

40:02.519 --> 40:05.519
Susan.

40:09.640 --> 40:13.000
If it's so terrible living with me,
why don't you go?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.319
Living with you isn't terrible.

40:15.320 --> 40:18.480
What's so bad about Alec?
I wish you'd tell me.

40:18.480 --> 40:21.480
It's not Alec as such, it's...

40:22.079 --> 40:24.318
what he does to you.

40:24.319 --> 40:27.319
The way he makes you behave, it...

40:28.559 --> 40:30.059
What's the point?

40:33.079 --> 40:35.999
It's not just the noise
of them banging away,

40:35.999 --> 40:38.520
it's him in the bathroom all the time,

40:38.520 --> 40:42.719
it's them taking over the lounge
and him cooking in the nude...

40:42.719 --> 40:45.719
Will you please just shut the fuck up?

40:46.679 --> 40:50.109
Oh. Thanks very much
for your kind understanding.

40:50.559 --> 40:53.159
You don't deserve
any kind understanding.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.659
Yeah, give it a rest.

40:55.999 --> 40:58.999
What about you? Had enough?

40:59.440 --> 41:02.158
I'll have another pint, cheers.

41:02.159 --> 41:05.159
You think I'm making a fuss
about nothing.

41:06.040 --> 41:09.040
(Both) Yes.
(Susan) Right.

41:09.439 --> 41:12.679
Get your coats on.
We're going back to my place.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.799
- What for?
- (Brian) It's miles away.

41:14.799 --> 41:19.629
The only way you'll believe me
is if you come and see for yourselves.

41:19.839 --> 41:22.078
I can't be arsed.

41:22.079 --> 41:25.439
- I'll buy you a kebab on the way.
- Not hungry.

41:27.079 --> 41:32.329
If you stay long enough, they'll go to bed
and you will hear them shagging.

41:34.200 --> 41:37.200
Drink up!

41:44.639 --> 41:46.679
Very nice.

- Have I been a cow?
- A bit.

45:13.759 --> 45:17.400
Fuck, why didn't I talk to you?
Everyone said I should.

45:17.400 --> 45:20.760

45:22.680 --> 45:25.240
and the more I was told
I was overreacting,

45:25.240 --> 45:27.358
the more I overreacted.

I've been childish
but when someone tells you that you're...

45:31.480 --> 45:33.319
Stop now.

- You weren't that bad.
- Wasn't I?

45:45.560 --> 45:48.570
- I wish you liked him.
- I still like you.

45:48.680 --> 45:52.810
- If you hate my boyfriend...
- I wouldn't say I hated him.

45:53.040 --> 45:56.040
Despise, loathe, detest, maybe.

45:56.200 --> 45:58.559

Sorry.

Fuck off.
