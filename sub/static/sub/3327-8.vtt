WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:04.425
(overlapping voices on TV)

00:10.740 --> 00:12.799
Don't you ever get tired
of this memory game?

00:12.840 --> 00:15.570
You do it every morning.
The mind is a muscle, Watson.

00:15.610 --> 00:18.545
It needs to be exercised
regularly lest It turn flabby.

00:18.580 --> 00:20.639
Most people
just read a book.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.614
I am reading a book.

00:22.650 --> 00:24.641
Well, do you mind
turning it off for a minute?

00:24.690 --> 00:26.555
I want to finish our_
conversation from last night.

00:26.590 --> 00:28.148
(sighs)

00:29.630 --> 00:31.279
Okay, I meant
all of them.

00:31.330 --> 00:33.298
Absorbing and cataloguing
several pieces of information

00:33.330 --> 00:35.594
at the same time
is the whole point.

00:35.630 --> 00:37.598
Talk away.

00:37.630 --> 00:39.564
Okay, well, then I want us
to get more serious

00:39.600 --> 00:41.261
about finding a sponsor.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.768
Why do I need a sponsor
when I have a companion?

00:43.810 --> 00:45.801
Because you only have me
for a few more weeks.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.808
A sponsor is permanent,
someone who's...

00:47.840 --> 00:49.569
struggled with their
own addictions

00:49.610 --> 00:51.840
and is gonna offer you
lifelong support and advice,

00:51.880 --> 00:53.370
which is what you need.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.482
The drugs that I took
seemed to light up my brain.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.351
Suddenly I realized

00:59.390 --> 01:02.382
the power I held,
the power to rule,

01:02.430 --> 01:04.751
to make the world grovel
at my feet.

01:06.660 --> 01:08.423
(video rewinding)

01:08.460 --> 01:11.429
The drugs I took seemed
to light up my brain.

01:11.470 --> 01:14.689
Suddenly I realized
the power I held,

01:14.740 --> 01:16.207
the power to rule,

01:16.240 --> 01:18.868
to make the world grovel
at my feet.

01:18.910 --> 01:20.707
Okay.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.674
Well, I know someone
who might be a good fit for you.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.200
I've worked with him before.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.603
Let's have coffee
with him, okay?

01:25.650 --> 01:28.539
IfI needed a sponsor,
that would sound delightful.

01:28.580 --> 01:31.447
I don't. Just like I didn't
need a sober companion.

01:31.490 --> 01:32.787
And you didn't need rehab

01:32.820 --> 01:34.310
and you didn't
need drug counseling

01:34.360 --> 01:35.759
and you didn't need
any help of any kind.

01:35.790 --> 01:38.156
I know.

01:38.190 --> 01:40.192
It's just coffee.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.722
Sherlock.
Fine. I'll go.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.795
Provided I can get some peace
and quiet around here.

01:48.670 --> 01:51.639
(overlapping voices)

01:51.670 --> 01:53.809
MAN:
We completely
understand, Mr. McKeon.

01:53.840 --> 01:54.875
Fluid layout.

01:54.910 --> 01:56.741
No, we-we agree, uh...

01:56.780 --> 01:59.715
grid-based design, it's gone
the way of the dinosaur.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.389
Will do.

02:02.420 --> 02:04.638
All right. Take care.

02:04.690 --> 02:07.488
_Our favorite _client's
still wringing his hands?

02:07.520 --> 02:09.158
Guy just does not get
Web design.

02:09.190 --> 02:12.193
'Course, he's like 45
or something.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.551
(beeping)

02:18.730 --> 02:20.436
(beeping continues)
No.

02:23.770 --> 02:26.307
I think it's coming
from inside the vent.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.175
(beeping continues)

02:33.220 --> 02:35.711
Yeah, repair guy must have
dropped his phone or something.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.843
MAN: That's going
to make us crazy.

02:37.890 --> 02:39.881
MAN 2:
I'll call maintenance.

02:46.730 --> 02:49.790
(beeping continues)

03:19.030 --> 03:21.851
The blast detonated in
the southeast corner

03:21.900 --> 03:24.368
of the office around
9:15 this morning.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.539
Killed two people,

03:26.570 --> 03:28.765
Dave Preston and Royce Maltz,

03:28.800 --> 03:30.904
and injured 11 more.

03:30.940 --> 03:32.805
Chemical composition
of the device?

03:32.840 --> 03:35.001
The bomb squad's
working on it.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.576
All they know
for sure is that

03:36.610 --> 03:37.941
the bomb was stashed
in that air vent.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.847
Both of the victims were
employees of this company?

03:40.880 --> 03:42.381
BELL:
Parabolic Web Industries.

03:42.420 --> 03:45.412
They design and maintain
corporate Web sites.

03:45.450 --> 03:47.384
We're looking
into whether anybody had beef

03:47.420 --> 03:49.559
with the firm.

03:49.590 --> 03:51.751
OFFICER:
Captain?

04:07.910 --> 04:10.879
I imagine you won't miss this
when you're gone.

04:12.450 --> 04:14.918
In a few weeks,
you'll be with your new client.

04:14.950 --> 04:18.044
No more crime scenes,
no more death and destruction.

04:18.090 --> 04:21.514
Most dangerous place you'll go
is a support group meeting

04:21.560 --> 04:23.858
where they've run out of coffee.

04:23.890 --> 04:26.825
Firstly, I don't have
a next client, and secondly,

04:26.860 --> 04:29.397
you're right, I'm not gonna
miss seeing this stuff.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.071
You see this?

04:43.110 --> 04:44.441
That's packing paper.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.539
It's used to fill the gap

04:46.580 --> 04:48.844
between the fuel and the
blast cap on a pipe bomb.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.848
When the bomb detonates,

04:50.890 --> 04:52.619
this paper is ejected
through the barrel

04:52.660 --> 04:54.548
before it has time
to fully combust.

04:54.590 --> 04:57.627
Now, weapons-grade munitions
uses pulp filler,

04:57.660 --> 04:59.855
not newspaper.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.549
The bomb squad
said the same thing.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.919
We're already
running a check

05:02.970 --> 05:04.460
on _recent _
commerCIal burglaries

05:04.500 --> 05:06.866
to see if _
anyone's missmg

05:06.900 --> 05:11.030
any flammable chemicals
or gunpowder.

05:11.070 --> 05:13.004
You got something?

05:13.040 --> 05:15.008
Motherboard.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.042
BELL:
You know this is
a computer company, right?

05:17.080 --> 05:18.877
Well, that's just it, Detective.

05:18.910 --> 05:20.741
This is not from a computer.

05:20.780 --> 05:21.940
It's from a pager.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.880
Note the presence of a receiver

05:23.920 --> 05:25.808
but the absence
of a transmitter.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.948
What's it doing here?

05:28.990 --> 05:31.481
Pre-explosion, this place looked
like the deck of a starship.

05:31.530 --> 05:33.054
It's unlikely any of
the firm's employees

05:33.100 --> 05:36.467
would use technology
as antiquated as a pager.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.127
You're saying
it's part of the bomb?

05:38.170 --> 05:40.968
I'm saying this may be
the bomb's detonator.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.900
The good news is, if it's
not too badly damaged,

05:42.940 --> 05:45.408
you'll be able to trace
the account.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.477
I'll get this
to tech assist right away.

05:48.510 --> 05:50.978
I'll let you know
when we hear something.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.012
If the motherboard
is still functional, how long

05:53.050 --> 05:54.972
do you think it's gonna take
the police to get a number?

05:55.020 --> 05:57.011
Two, maybe three hours. Why?

05:59.050 --> 06:00.608
WATSON:
The sponsor's name is Adrian,

06:00.660 --> 06:02.719
and he works on the floor
of the stock exchange.

06:02.760 --> 06:03.920
Good thinking, Watson.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.518
You know how much
I enjoy bankers.

06:05.560 --> 06:06.754
Glad to _see _
you've been paying attention

06:06.800 --> 06:08.051
over the last few weeks.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.489
Actually, he's an officer
with the SEC.

06:10.530 --> 06:12.896
So he spends his days
keeping bankers in line.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.898
He also spent four years at
the London School of Economics,

06:15.940 --> 06:18.158
so he knows
your old stomping grounds.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.735
You think I'd just pick any name
out of a hat? Oh, there he is.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.668
Hey, Adrian.

06:22.710 --> 06:25.543
Hi. Adrian, Sherlock.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.116
Pleasure.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.918
Well, you guys talk.

06:31.950 --> 06:33.986
I'll be over there
when you're ready.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.689
A hypothetical, Adrian.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.152
I call you in the middle
of the night,

06:41.200 --> 06:42.724
I tell you that I'm thinking
of using again,

06:42.770 --> 06:43.998
and that if I don't,
I might die.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.463
How do you respond?

06:45.500 --> 06:47.036
Well, Sherlock,
I think I'd start

06:47.070 --> 06:49.630
by reminding you, you got
to take it one day at a time,

06:49.670 --> 06:51.160
and that every clean
day is a victory.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.633
I call you and tell you
that an enemy has poisoned me

06:53.680 --> 06:55.079
with a powerful
neuroleptic agent.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.203
The only antidote is a
healthy dose of diphenhydramine,

06:57.250 --> 06:58.706
of which I have plenty.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.047
Do you advise me to take it?

07:00.080 --> 07:01.547
Diphen...

07:01.580 --> 07:02.911
Diphenhydramine.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.714
You find
murder-by-poisoning humorous?

07:05.750 --> 07:07.149
No, of course not. I just...

07:07.190 --> 07:09.112
The diphenhydramine,
Adrian, do I take it?

07:09.160 --> 07:12.721
If it's gonna save your life,

07:12.760 --> 07:14.853
then yeah, of course you do.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.999
That's your idea of a
good fit, seriously?

07:27.040 --> 07:29.508
I told you, he's one
of the best sponsors I know.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.848
Peter Platitude? I was waiting
for him to hold my hand

07:31.880 --> 07:33.472
so we could recite
the Serenity Prayer.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.738
Okay, if you want to hear
something other that platitudes,

07:35.780 --> 07:37.987
try listening to the guy
for more than two minutes.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.659
The man encouraged me to take
diphenhydramine, Watson.

07:40.690 --> 07:42.089
A deliriant.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.724
The Republic of Zambia
recently classified that

07:43.760 --> 07:45.159
a controlled substance.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.192
Now, what kind of a sponsor
would allow his sponsee

07:47.230 --> 07:49.027
to risk their sobriety
over a simple case

07:49.060 --> 07:50.027
of neuroleptic poisoning?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.594
Okay, you think I don't know

07:51.630 --> 07:53.063
there's no right answer
to that question?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.738
You don't want Adrian?

07:54.770 --> 07:55.998
Okay. This is a process.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.065
We can look for other candidates
at group tonight.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.998
But know this: We are gonna
find you a sponsor

08:00.040 --> 08:02.076
before my stint is up, okay?

08:02.110 --> 08:05.602
(phone ringing)

08:05.650 --> 08:07.015
Ha.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.074
Captain.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.610
That motherboard you found--

08:09.650 --> 08:11.140
bomb squad confirmed
it was part of the device,

08:11.190 --> 08:12.782
so touch.

08:12.820 --> 08:14.219
The pager it was part of
was prepaid,

08:14.260 --> 08:15.989
so there was no subscriber info,

08:16.020 --> 08:18.079
but luckily, the tech assist

08:18.130 --> 08:19.825
was able to pull
a number off it.

08:19.860 --> 08:22.090
And the same phone
called the pager

08:22.130 --> 08:23.688
three times this morning,

08:23.730 --> 08:26.665
and each call was within seconds
of the bomb going off.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.292
Were you able
to trace the number?

08:28.340 --> 08:32.003
Yeah, to a plumber
named Rennie Jacobs from Queens.

08:32.040 --> 08:34.235
And get this,
he just did a six-year stretch

08:34.280 --> 08:35.599
for burning down his apartment

08:35.640 --> 08:37.779
in an insurance fraud scheme.

08:37.810 --> 08:39.175
Any particular reason

08:39.210 --> 08:41.110
he'd want to depredate
that Web design firm?

08:41.150 --> 08:43.880
No clue, but, uh,
if you want to see him

08:43.920 --> 08:46.218
live and in person,
he just got here.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.649
I was just trying
to call in

08:47.690 --> 08:49.555
a breakfast sandwich order,
thatsit

08:49.590 --> 08:51.729
Three times you called
that pager, Mr. Jacobs.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.125
Three times.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.628
You said the pager number
was 555-0164, right?

08:55.660 --> 08:57.025
212 area code?

08:57.070 --> 09:00.096
I was trying to call
Miracle Deli on 113th.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.698
Their number is off

09:01.740 --> 09:05.107
by one digit. 0165.

09:05.140 --> 09:08.177
I must've misdialed, 'cause
when they didn't answer,
(line ringing)

09:08.210 --> 09:09.905
I hit redial.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.076
Twice.

09:11.110 --> 09:12.975
MAN: Miracle Deli.
Pickup or delivery?

09:13.020 --> 09:14.874
He's telling the truth

09:14.920 --> 09:16.740
about the numbers being off
by a single digit.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.189
Yeah, we know.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.984
Coincidence bugs me, but not
enough to cut him loose.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.726
(phone vibrates)

09:22.760 --> 09:24.284
I got to step out.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.127
Bomb squad wants to brief me.

09:27.230 --> 09:30.267
(door opens, closes)

09:30.300 --> 09:33.167
You don't look convinced.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.760
Bomb-building
is a dangerous venture.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.768
It requires patience,
precision,

09:37.810 --> 09:39.835
attention to detail.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.178
Mr. J_acobs_' wristwatch
is nine minutes slow

09:42.210 --> 09:44.178
and his fly
is three-quarters down.

09:44.210 --> 09:47.373
That doesn't scream
detail-oriented.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.241
Ted Kaczynski looked like
a hobo puked another hobo.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.246
He managed
to hurt plenty of people.

09:53.790 --> 09:55.781
Point taken.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.895
Yeah.

10:02.730 --> 10:04.129
Can I help you?

10:04.170 --> 10:06.195
This is the, uh...

10:06.230 --> 10:08.130
the bomb's power source,
I presume?

10:08.170 --> 10:09.933
Six volt.

10:09.970 --> 10:12.029
Very interesting company,
PrimSource Battery.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.106
Founded in 1888
by British expat

10:14.140 --> 10:15.676
and purveyor
of mechanical novelties,

10:15.710 --> 10:17.268
Hubert Primler.

10:17.310 --> 10:20.177
They switched to making
batteries full-time in 1907,

10:20.220 --> 10:22.142
each one stamped
with the company's

10:22.180 --> 10:24.410
now iconic rising-sun logo.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.714
The logo remained unchanged
until 2008,

10:26.760 --> 10:28.648
when a small oak tree was added

10:28.690 --> 10:30.351
to commemorate
the company's centenary.

10:30.390 --> 10:32.995
Yet this one has no oak tree.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.197
That means that battery

10:35.230 --> 10:37.061
is more than four years old.

10:37.100 --> 10:40.194
Odd, isn't it,
go to all that trouble

10:40.240 --> 10:41.434
building an elaborate
explosive device

10:41.470 --> 10:43.199
and then power it with an old

10:43.240 --> 10:44.730
and potentially
unreliable battery?

10:44.770 --> 10:46.977
Odd, yes,
but not impossible.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.308
Holmes, Holmes,
I've only got a few minutes here

10:49.340 --> 10:51.205
to pick Bennett's brain
before I have

10:51.250 --> 10:52.444
to stand in front
of 20 cameras

10:52.480 --> 10:53.811
to explain what happened
this morning.

10:53.850 --> 10:55.875
What about that?
What about what?

10:55.920 --> 10:57.717
OFFICER:
It's the president.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.911
Wrong. It's the senator.
Captain...

10:59.960 --> 11:01.279
Senator Obama,
not President Obama.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.823
You can tell from the lack
of gray in his hair.

11:03.860 --> 11:06.124
He's right. I can make
out a date on this one.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.151
October 13, 2008.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.451
So, what are you saying?

11:09.500 --> 11:11.229
That battery is four years old.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.431
These shreds of newspaper
are four years old.

11:13.470 --> 11:16.098
The bomb that exploded
this morning was four years old.

11:16.140 --> 11:17.300
But why would the suspect
build a bomb

11:17.340 --> 11:18.932
and sit on it for four years?

11:18.970 --> 11:20.801
He wouldn't have.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.330
And in Rennie Jacobs's case,
he couldn't have.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.779
He was in prison
four years ago.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.243
I think he was telling the truth

11:25.280 --> 11:27.214
when he said he dialed
the wrong number this morning.

11:27.250 --> 11:30.742
We have the man who set it off
accidentally in 2012.

11:30.790 --> 11:34.453
Now we just need the man who
intended to set it off in 2008.

11:38.830 --> 11:40.923
You're sure he's not the
one who built the bomb?
Sure? No.

11:42.530 --> 11:45.090
The NYPD can continue
to poke and prod him.

11:45.130 --> 11:47.189
In the meantime,
you and I can push forward

11:47.240 --> 11:49.128
on this, our new front.

11:49.170 --> 11:52.037
It is a lovely front.

11:52.070 --> 11:53.970
Hmm. Vanowen _
Strategic Communications.

11:54.010 --> 11:57.002
Public relations consultancy
founded in 1994

11:57.050 --> 12:00.372
by Harrington School of Business
alumna Heather Vanowen.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.014
The firm is particularly adept
at solving image crises

12:03.050 --> 12:04.779
of the corporate variety,

12:04.820 --> 12:08.187
making them one-stop shopping
for many of the Fortune 500.

12:08.220 --> 12:11.849
Spin doctors
of the highest order, and

12:11.890 --> 12:14.029
former tenants
of the midtown offices

12:14.060 --> 12:16.324
ravaged by a homemade bomb
this morning.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.124
They occupied the space
until December 2008.

12:19.170 --> 12:22.094
Now, if I'm right and the bomb
was planted that October,

12:22.140 --> 12:24.267
this company
or one of its employees

12:24.310 --> 12:26.505
may have been
the intended target.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.270
WOMAN:
Mr. Holmes?

12:29.310 --> 12:30.504
Heather Vanowen.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.370
This is Earl Wheeler, my CFO.

12:32.410 --> 12:35.516
We were told you work
with the police.

12:35.550 --> 12:37.211
I'm their consultant.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.410
This is Miss Watson.

12:38.450 --> 12:40.884
She is my consultant,
slash housekeep.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.285
So, how can we
help you today?

12:42.320 --> 12:44.254
Well, you can start
by telling us

12:44.290 --> 12:47.293
who maybe have wanted
to blow you up in 2008.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.388
I'm stunned.

12:50.430 --> 12:52.159
I-I saw the story
on the news this morning.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.532
I knew that was our old
office space, but...

12:54.570 --> 12:56.902
I never would have guessed
that that bomb

12:56.940 --> 12:58.965
was meant for us.
WHEELER:
So you honestly think

12:59.010 --> 13:01.228
it was just sitting
there this whole time?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.339
The police think it was tucked
into an air vent.

13:03.380 --> 13:05.245
If that part of the building's
climate control system

13:05.280 --> 13:07.043
had never needed repair--

13:07.080 --> 13:09.310
and judging by this morning's
events, it didn't--

13:09.350 --> 13:11.318
it could have gone
undiscovered indefinitely.

13:11.350 --> 13:13.511
Okay, but why this morning?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.448
Why'd it go off
after all this time?

13:15.490 --> 13:17.151
The bomb was detonated
by a pager.

13:17.190 --> 13:20.921
In 2008, the company
that made that pager

13:20.960 --> 13:25.021
had no signal towers within
42 blocks of your old offices.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.469
In 2010,

13:26.500 --> 13:29.264
they erected a new tower

13:29.300 --> 13:31.200
a mere three blocks away.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.003
So the bomb didn't detonate

13:33.040 --> 13:35.338
in 2008 because the call
couldn't go through.

13:35.380 --> 13:37.905
The question is:
Who built the device,

13:37.950 --> 13:40.510
and what may they have had
against your company?

13:40.550 --> 13:42.279
I'm sure that we've made
our fair share of enemies

13:42.320 --> 13:44.345
along the way, but, um...
someone who would build

13:44.390 --> 13:45.584
a bomb?

13:45.620 --> 13:48.088
The ELM.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.520
The Earth Liberty Militia.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.255
We got some threatening letters
from them in 2008.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.429
They're an ecoterrorist
group, right?

13:54.460 --> 13:56.428
They've bombed a few other
companies over the years.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.293
What would an ecoterrorist group
have against a PR firm?

13:59.330 --> 14:01.469
Our clients.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.968
We work with some of
the major energy conglomerates.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.363
Occasionally we
have to help them

14:05.410 --> 14:06.638
_ smooth over_their
image after mishaps.

14:06.670 --> 14:09.104
200 million gallons of oil

14:09.140 --> 14:11.108
spilling into the Gulf,
for example?

14:11.150 --> 14:13.539
The ELM sent us
seven letters in 2008.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.411
I know that we kept hard copies
of them in our records room.

14:15.450 --> 14:16.644
You want to take a look?

14:16.680 --> 14:18.386
We would.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.483
Effluvium, fussbudget, Cairo.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.419
Nine across,
14 down, 32 down.

14:26.460 --> 14:29.623
I-I have a sort of thing
for puzzles.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.996
When_I first tried
getting clean,

14:36.040 --> 14:37.507
I started drinking.

14:37.540 --> 14:40.077
Before long, I realized
that I had swapped

14:40.110 --> 14:41.509
one addiction
for another.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.007
Please put those away.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.143
"You cannot stop this.
You can only submit.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.478
Submit or be destroyed."

14:47.520 --> 14:50.546
That's something
the ELM would say.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.080
Here...

14:52.120 --> 14:54.088
Not the time,
not the place.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.554
I'm sorry, but from a forensic
linguistics standpoint,

14:56.590 --> 14:58.353
these threats _are
qUIte fascmating.

15:01.430 --> 15:04.558
that the_ ELM was not
an organization, per se,

15:04.600 --> 15:07.592
but one man posing
as an organization.

15:08.970 --> 15:11.109
Seriously, can you just
examine those at home?

15:11.140 --> 15:12.562
We have work
to do here.

15:12.610 --> 15:14.999
Oh, yeah.
Sponsor Search 2012.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.076
I have to say, Watson,

15:17.110 --> 15:19.305
it's a bit of _
a motley crew tonight.

15:19.350 --> 15:21.443
I don't think these are
my kind of addicts.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.517
I think this is going to be
a much longer

15:24.550 --> 15:26.438
and more involved process
than we initially thought.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.708
You have 23 days.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.489
Then our time is up.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.950
MAN:
My name is Alfredo,
and I'm an addict.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.490
ALL:
Hi, Alfredo.

15:36.530 --> 15:40.091
ALFREDO:
Started boosting cars
when I was 14.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.459
By the time I turned 18,

15:41.500 --> 15:43.604
I was the best there is.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.505
Ain't a car in the city
I can't steal.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.303
Him.

15:47.340 --> 15:48.534
Hmm?
Now I'm flush
with cash,

15:48.580 --> 15:50.571
I'm bored... I turn to drugs.

15:50.610 --> 15:53.647
I want him to
be my sponsor.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.170
Took my first hit at 19...

15:57.650 --> 16:01.017
This phrase,
"on your beam ends,"

16:01.060 --> 16:03.585
it appears in five
of the seven threats.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.689
I'm certain I've heard
it before; I just...

16:05.730 --> 16:07.357
can't recall where.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.594
"On your beam ends."

16:08.630 --> 16:10.268
A nautical idiom
first documented

16:10.300 --> 16:12.621
in Captain Frederick
Marryat's 1830 novel

16:12.670 --> 16:14.365
The King's Own,

16:14.400 --> 16:16.265
signifying a situation
of great peril.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.302
Strange for such
an aberrant phrase

16:18.340 --> 16:19.534
to appear so repeatedly.

16:19.570 --> 16:22.778
Are you seriously
going to make me ask?

16:22.810 --> 16:25.142
Ask what?
About your sponsor, Alfredo.

16:25.180 --> 16:26.670
Delightful fellow.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.314
He's agreed to meet us
both tomorrow for coffee.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.284
So we can get to
know one another.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.685
You don't approve?

16:31.720 --> 16:33.585
I'm just a little confused,
that's all.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.315
I mean, you actually met Adrian.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.679
You talked to him
before you turned him down.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.621
You heard Alfredo speak
for 15 seconds.

16:39.660 --> 16:41.457
Oh, have you not
figured out by now

16:41.500 --> 16:44.219
that I see far more_
than your average addict?

16:44.270 --> 16:45.760
My observational skills
are second to none.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.530
I know. I know that.
I just... I want to leave you

16:48.570 --> 16:51.061
in the best situation possible.
It's important to me.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.805
Got it.
Good. I'm glad.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.603
No. "On your beam ends."

16:54.640 --> 16:56.107
I've got it.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.677
I know where I was
when I heard it.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.409
That one.

17:04.450 --> 17:06.611
That's where I saw it,
weeks ago.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.210
But what was the context?

17:12.660 --> 17:14.252
Yellow cartoon sponge man,

17:14.300 --> 17:17.098
sports news,
mouthwash advert,

17:17.130 --> 17:19.166
Arctic Blue...
You want to tell me
what you're domg?

17:19.200 --> 17:21.498
Uh, method of loci,
mnemonic device.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.202
Relies on memorized spatial
relationships to establish,

17:24.240 --> 17:27.676
catalogue and recollect
memorial content.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.071
If I remember what was
on these SIX screens,

17:31.110 --> 17:33.772
I'll remember what
was on the seventh.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.683
Fat lady, new cookbook,
insufferable.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.654
Erectile dysfunction.
Nature program, penguins.

17:41.690 --> 17:44.625
And... talk show.

17:44.660 --> 17:47.754
The topic was...
international whaling laws.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.395
Two guests got into an argument.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.733
MAN: _
You are not seriously suggesting

18:00.780 --> 18:03.305
that cleaning out the
Pacific Ocean is a good idea.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.669
What do you suggest
we tell the Japanese worker

18:04.710 --> 18:06.177
whose livelihood
depends upon this trade?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.314
MAN:
Just... you don't get it.

18:08.350 --> 18:11.183
One day 50 years from now,
when you're on your beam ends,

18:11.220 --> 18:13.609
you'll wish you'd done
more when you could have.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.117
That's the same bombast

18:16.160 --> 18:17.525
I read in the ELM letters.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.652
It's the same hyperbole.

18:18.690 --> 18:20.123
Same weird phrase.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.650
You really think it's him?

18:21.700 --> 18:23.565
I know a way to find out.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.397
MAN:
I'm confused, Detective.

18:25.430 --> 18:28.763
You're accusing me of being
some sort of ecoterrorist?

18:28.800 --> 18:31.200
One of our special consultants

18:31.240 --> 18:34.209
thinks your speech pattern
is a match for these letters.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.776
For the last time,

18:35.810 --> 18:37.846
I have never seen
these letters before.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.348
I don't know anything
about the ELM,

18:40.380 --> 18:42.314
and I certainly didn't
build any bombs.

18:42.350 --> 18:45.547
Lie, lie and lie.

18:45.590 --> 18:46.887
Who the hell are you?

18:46.920 --> 18:49.218
I am the man with the button.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.148
It's from the elevator
down the hall.

18:51.190 --> 18:52.851
You pushed it
to get to this floor.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.790
As soon as you disembarked,
I removed it,

18:54.830 --> 18:57.321
and took it to the department's
latent print unit.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.520
It has your fingerprint
on it, you see.

18:59.570 --> 19:01.697
Which means it has
a great deal in common

19:01.740 --> 19:04.868
with a component
from a bomb the ELM detonated

19:04.910 --> 19:08.334
in a lumber mill
in Utica in 2005.

19:08.380 --> 19:11.269
Button... bomb.

19:11.310 --> 19:13.744
Button...
bomb.

19:13.780 --> 19:16.317
The similarities are quite
striking, wouldn't you agree?

19:16.350 --> 19:17.908
You built the ELM bombs,
Mr. Knowles.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.747
And you wrote
those letters.

19:19.790 --> 19:21.678
It's too bad you didn't
go back for the one

19:21.720 --> 19:23.881
you left at Vanowen S.C. when
you realized it was defective.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.353
Maybe you wouldn't be facing
two murder charges today.

19:28.630 --> 19:30.518
I bombed that lumber mill.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.367
And I wrote these letters
to Vanowen S.C.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.664
But you know what I didn't do?

19:37.710 --> 19:38.904
Follow up on them.

19:38.940 --> 19:42.637
By 2008, I had
successfully detonated

19:42.680 --> 19:45.706
nitrate-based bombs at
five different companies.

19:45.750 --> 19:49.277
I was established,
and I was taken very seriously.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.517
Vanowen S.C. was one of
several dozen busmesses

19:52.550 --> 19:54.609
I threatened but never bombed.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.855
Why am I not surprised
you'd take credit

19:56.890 --> 19:58.778
for every bombing except

19:58.830 --> 20:01.856
the one that
killed two people?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.697
(small explosion)
WATSON:
Was that you?

20:03.730 --> 20:05.368
Was what me?

20:08.600 --> 20:11.307
What did those balls
ever do to you?

20:11.340 --> 20:12.864
(breathing deeply)

20:12.910 --> 20:14.935
They're dying
for a good cause, Watson.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.574
Of course they are.
Ah!

20:19.450 --> 20:20.678
Did you know

20:20.720 --> 20:22.517
that when a bomb explodes,

20:22.550 --> 20:24.939
the component that houses
the fuel is often atomized?

20:24.990 --> 20:27.811
Now, this can make it difficult,
if not downright impossible,

20:27.860 --> 20:30.852
to identify the device's
chemical composition.

20:30.890 --> 20:33.256
The NYPD bomb squad
is currently struggling

20:33.300 --> 20:35.495
with this very conundrum,
so I thought I would help.

20:35.530 --> 20:37.896
With tennis balls?_
I'm attempting to replicate

20:37.930 --> 20:40.694
the odor and burn pattern
of the office bombing

20:40.740 --> 20:42.799
using a few of my own
concoctions, and these balls

20:42.840 --> 20:45.400
make the perfect
delivery mechanism.

20:54.880 --> 20:55.869
(breathing deeply)

20:55.920 --> 20:57.808
(sniffing)

20:57.850 --> 20:59.511
When Edgar Knowles was
arrested this afternoon,

20:59.550 --> 21:00.949
he confessed to setting off

21:00.990 --> 21:04.448
five nitrate-based bombs
at various busmesses.

21:04.490 --> 21:06.424
No self-respecting eco-warrior

21:06.460 --> 21:09.520
would use toxic, man-made
chemicals in his bombs.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.358
He would use
natural ingredients.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.595
Smells like fertilizer.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.834
With good reason.

21:15.870 --> 21:17.838
Beyond its horticultural
employments,

21:17.870 --> 21:19.360
fertilizer can be
distilled down

21:19.410 --> 21:22.538
and mixed into a rather potent
nitrate accelerant.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.673
This ball is filled
with the stuff.

21:24.710 --> 21:27.838
If Knowles did try
to blow up Vanowen S.C.,

21:27.880 --> 21:30.019
he would have used nitrates,
and if he'd used nitrates,

21:30.050 --> 21:31.984
the bomb would have filled
the air with an odor

21:32.020 --> 21:33.988
as pungent
as it is distinctive,

21:34.020 --> 21:35.988
the same odor that
you're smelling right now.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.521
The thing is,
I didn't smell

21:37.560 --> 21:38.982
any fertilizer
when we were there.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.850
I smelled something else.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.959
It was foreign to me
in the moment, but...

21:43.000 --> 21:44.695
I have managed to recreate it
with the help of

21:44.730 --> 21:46.789
my little
round friends here.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.695
I am now certain
that the bomb was made

21:48.740 --> 21:49.934
using potassium chlorate.

21:49.970 --> 21:51.528
It's an accelerant made of

21:51.570 --> 21:53.572
gasoline, bleach
and petroleum jelly.

21:53.610 --> 21:55.999
Are you saying that Edgar
Knowles was telling the truth

21:56.040 --> 21:57.871
when he told you that
he didn't build the bomb

21:57.910 --> 21:59.741
that exploded at Vanowen S.C.?

21:59.780 --> 22:03.011
I am.
Well, if he didn't
build it, who did?

22:03.050 --> 22:05.917
Haven't the foggiest.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.622
(indistinct chatter,
phone ringing)

22:25.810 --> 22:26.765
(raps on fence)
Hey.

22:26.810 --> 22:29.699
Heard you were
looking for me?

22:29.740 --> 22:32.709
Yesterday, you gave
us Edgar Knowles
on a silver platter.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.741
Now you're telling me

22:34.780 --> 22:37.146
he did every bomb
except for the one

22:37.180 --> 22:38.943
from two days ago?
As I said before,

22:38.990 --> 22:41.515
that bomb was built using
potassium chlorate.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.824
Yeah, and Knowles only used
ones with cow manure.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.157
I heard you.
That's not enough.

22:45.190 --> 22:47.124
There's _more. _
I came in this morning

22:47.160 --> 22:49.628
to reexamine the
bomb's components,
and I pieced together

22:49.660 --> 22:50.991
some of the strips
of packing paper

22:51.030 --> 22:52.759
that were used.
I managed to form

22:52.800 --> 22:54.836
almost a third of a page
of the October 13 edition

22:54.870 --> 22:56.428
of the New York Times.

22:56.470 --> 22:58.529
This particular clump
caught my eye.

22:58.570 --> 23:01.630
I saw small, almost
imperceptible indentations

23:01.680 --> 23:03.648
along the upper fringe.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.772
I don't see anything.

23:04.810 --> 23:06.744
You wouldn't.

23:06.780 --> 23:08.748
Well, most people
wouldn't, which is why

23:08.780 --> 23:11.010
I traced over it.

23:12.790 --> 23:14.155
The paper
that was used

23:14.190 --> 23:16.055
in the bomb was
beneath another piece

23:16.090 --> 23:17.921
of paper when
someone wrote that word.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.689
They pressed hard enough
to make indentations.

23:19.730 --> 23:20.856
Now, I already checked it

23:20.900 --> 23:22.094
against Edgar Knowles's
handwriting.

23:22.130 --> 23:23.097
It's not a match.

23:23.130 --> 23:24.199
All due respect,
Holmes.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.424
So what?

23:25.470 --> 23:26.926
Maybe he had help with the bomb.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.164
Maybe that person wrote some

23:28.200 --> 23:29.997
weird note on top
of the newspaper.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.531
As I said previously, I believe
Edgar Knowles worked alone.

23:32.570 --> 23:34.572
And as I said previously,
I still like him

23:34.610 --> 23:36.874
for the last bomb.

23:36.910 --> 23:39.208
The threats against Vanowen
S.C. were never made public,

23:39.250 --> 23:40.808
which means, aside
from the police,

23:40.850 --> 23:42.078
the firm's employees
were the only ones

23:42.120 --> 23:43.644
who were aware of them.

23:43.690 --> 23:44.918
I'd like you to
request a subpoena

23:44.950 --> 23:46.542
of their personnel files

23:46.590 --> 23:48.581
so that I can
reVIew them.
For what?

23:48.620 --> 23:50.451
Well, imagine you were a
disgruntled employee, hmm?

23:50.490 --> 23:52.958
You want to strike out at the
company, but you don't want

23:52.990 --> 23:55.220
to get caught, so why not take
advantage of the ELM threats

23:55.260 --> 23:56.955
to plant a device
of your own, hmm?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.729
You get the blast,
they get the blame.

23:58.770 --> 23:59.725
No.

23:59.770 --> 24:00.737
No?

24:00.770 --> 24:01.896
No subpoena.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.931
If you really want
to go poking around

24:03.970 --> 24:05.631
at Vanowen S.C.,
you're gonna have

24:05.670 --> 24:06.967
to take it up with them.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.204
(door opens)

24:08.240 --> 24:10.071
Sorry I'm late.
(door closes)

24:14.920 --> 24:17.741
I'm sure he's gonna
be here any second.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.852
I really like those...

24:22.890 --> 24:24.585
tattoos .

24:27.030 --> 24:29.590
You know, I'm just gonna text
him again and see where he is.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.992
(phone beeps)

24:39.210 --> 24:41.974
I'm really sorry, Alfredo,
but it doesn't look

24:42.010 --> 24:44.604
like Sherlock is coming
and joining us today.

24:44.650 --> 24:45.969
Be patient.

24:46.010 --> 24:48.843
First rule
of good sponsorship.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.087
Newcomers like him
don't always understand

24:51.120 --> 24:52.747
the scope of the work involved.

24:52.790 --> 24:54.883
They get frustrated.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.911
We need to be patient
and methodical with him.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.689
I was under the impression

24:58.730 --> 25:00.618
that you'd never been
a sponsor before.

25:00.660 --> 25:01.854
I haven't.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.197
But I have a great one.

25:03.230 --> 25:05.289
Taught me
everything he knows.

25:05.330 --> 25:09.164
Truth is, I've been wanting
to be a sponsor for a while now.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.532
People never ask.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.777
Think it's because I'm quiet.

25:13.810 --> 25:17.007
I can help your friend,
Miss Watson.

25:17.040 --> 25:20.077
He just needs
to give me the chance.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.554
Doing okay?

25:32.590 --> 25:34.091
Iam.

25:34.130 --> 25:36.997
And thank you again for allowing
me to peruse these files.

25:37.030 --> 25:39.567
Oh, it was
an easy decision to make.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.636
If you think there's
anyone here who has something

25:41.670 --> 25:44.559
against this company,
I would like to know.

25:47.140 --> 25:49.836
You're a fellow addict,
aren't you?

25:52.010 --> 25:53.648
Crosswords.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.045
_ You couldn't have
figured out those clues

25:55.080 --> 25:57.344
at my computer
the other day if you weren't.

25:57.380 --> 25:59.644
I dabble.

25:59.690 --> 26:01.988
Well, I wish I could say
I just dabbled.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.181
I used to have
my habit under control

26:04.230 --> 26:07.085
back when the papers
only issued one a day.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.052
Ever since they put
the last 50 years

26:09.100 --> 26:11.796
of their archives online,
I'm a lost cause.

26:11.830 --> 26:14.333
It's a miracle I get
any work done at all.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.729
You want sex?

26:17.770 --> 26:18.964
Excuse me?

26:19.010 --> 26:21.001
I'm not averse,
Ms. Vanowen.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.132
I'm just busy.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.842
Perhaps we could set
an appointment.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.848
You're flirting.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.245
This crossword talk.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.044
You find me attractive.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.116
The feeling is
mutual, mostly.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.912
The musculature
of your legs

26:35.960 --> 26:38.053
and your shoulders suggests
a certain elasticity I find

26:38.090 --> 26:40.752
quite tantalizing.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.018
I must warn you, however,
a relationship between us

26:43.060 --> 26:44.869
could never go
beyond the physical.

26:46.270 --> 26:47.794
No offense to you, of course.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.990
It's just... not my way.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.701
Hey.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.230
Am I interrupting?

26:53.270 --> 26:54.976
Nope.

26:55.010 --> 26:57.001
Not even a little.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.889
Sorry I missed our
engagement, Watson.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.410
As you can see,
I'm investigating

27:06.450 --> 27:10.079
the possibility that a Vanowen
employee set the bomb.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.429
It's okay-- I told Alfredo
I'd be in touch, and that

27:12.460 --> 27:14.621
we could reschedule.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.088
Is that
the whole piece?
Uh...

27:22.140 --> 27:22.959
Pradeep Singh.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.265
Hired as a copywriter
in December 2003.

27:26.310 --> 27:29.370
He was promoted to junior
associate in January 2007,

27:29.410 --> 27:31.970
senior associate
in June 2007,

27:32.010 --> 27:36.140
and finally associate
creative director in March 2008.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.784
I see here that he
was written up

27:37.820 --> 27:40.880
by the human resources
department on October 10, 2008

27:40.920 --> 27:43.115
for engaging in a shouting match
with you, Mr. Wheeler.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.923
I see the
human resources' report,

27:44.960 --> 27:47.155
then nothing--
no more papers...

27:47.190 --> 27:48.191
Yes, that's because
his contract

27:48.230 --> 27:49.720
with this company
was terminated.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.125
Because he fought with you?

27:51.170 --> 27:52.421
Because he disappeared.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.461
He came to work, left,
never came back.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.764
It was in all the
papers at the time.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.803
The police got involved,
never found him.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.172
May I ask what sparked
the disagreement between

28:02.210 --> 28:04.804
the two of you?

28:04.850 --> 28:07.205
Uh... Pradeep wasn't happy.

28:07.250 --> 28:10.117
He was a model employee
at the beginning,

28:10.150 --> 28:11.845
but something changed him.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.983
He became-- I don't
know-- arrogant.

28:14.020 --> 28:16.284
He started talking about
how he wanted more power

28:16.320 --> 28:17.856
here at the company,
more control,

28:17.890 --> 28:19.289
and we gave it to him at first.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.059
I mean, Pradeep was

28:21.100 --> 28:22.328
a capable guy.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.918
Then it all changed
when he came in asking

28:23.970 --> 28:27.098
for his fourth raise
in 18 months.

28:27.130 --> 28:28.939
Well...
You told him
enough was enough?

28:28.970 --> 28:30.733
No, that's when he snapped.

28:30.770 --> 28:33.000
He told me
I'd be sorry.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.473
And he worked here
for about another week,

28:34.510 --> 28:36.000
and after that, he was gone.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.179
Never saw
him again.

28:38.210 --> 28:40.098
WOMAN:
Pradeep is dead.

28:40.150 --> 28:41.344
He died in 2008.

28:41.380 --> 28:42.779
HOLMES:
It was our understanding,

28:42.820 --> 28:45.482
Mrs. Singh, that he
was never found,

28:45.520 --> 28:47.078
alive or dead.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.851
My husband loved me very much,
just as I loved him.

28:50.890 --> 28:53.893
He never would run away.

28:53.930 --> 28:56.148
I held out hope for him
for quite some time,

28:56.200 --> 28:58.065
but eventually I had to accept

28:58.100 --> 29:00.261
that the only
possible explanation

29:00.300 --> 29:02.268
for his disappearance
was death.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.860
You think he was
a victim of foul play.

29:04.910 --> 29:08.129
If he had collapsed somewhere,
had a heart attack or a stroke,

29:08.180 --> 29:10.239
someone would have found him.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.100
Pradeep was murdered.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.948
Or he snapped-- planted
a bomb at his workplace,

29:14.980 --> 29:16.845
and then dropped off the grid
before it detonated.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.212
Do you have any idea
who might have wanted

29:19.250 --> 29:20.319
to hurt your husband?

29:20.350 --> 29:22.818
No.

29:22.860 --> 29:25.158
There was the one man
at his office he argued with

29:25.190 --> 29:27.124
a few days
before he vanished,

29:27.160 --> 29:29.025
but the police
were able to clear him.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.324
Other than that,
he had no enemies.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.065
He was a_...
I'm just curious,
Mrs. Singh.

29:33.100 --> 29:35.136
Have you had any work done
in this room since 2008?

29:35.170 --> 29:36.296
Work?
Remodeling,

29:36.340 --> 29:38.968
refurbishment, reconstruction.

29:39.010 --> 29:41.274
No, I haven't touched it
since Pradeep disappeared.

29:41.310 --> 29:43.301
Not even to address the mold
on the wall behind that cabinet?

29:43.340 --> 29:45.376
How did you...

29:45.410 --> 29:47.503
The nose knows.

29:47.550 --> 29:50.178
Might we take a look
in your backyard?

29:50.220 --> 29:51.482
Why?

29:51.520 --> 29:53.511
Formality.

30:01.230 --> 30:03.152
Actually, I think I'll just use
your facilities first.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.929
I think I had a dodgy egg.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.165
I'll join you presently.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.191
(door closes)

30:30.220 --> 30:32.222
*

31:02.260 --> 31:04.228
It did.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.319
It was nice to be
out in the country.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.995
Would you excuse
us a moment?

31:11.030 --> 31:13.021
Sure.
Excuse me.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.035
Mrs. Singh was right--
her husband is dead.

31:17.070 --> 31:18.606
He has been_ for
qUIte some time.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.665
What are you talking about?
The photograph
at the end

31:20.710 --> 31:22.337
of the mantelpiece,
it shows Pradeep and Mrs. Singh

31:22.380 --> 31:23.199
sitting on the sofa.
It was taken

31:23.240 --> 31:25.242
in the same room
that we were Sitting in.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.145
I noticed several discrepancies
between the wall

31:27.180 --> 31:29.341
in the photograph and the one
that we were facing.

31:29.380 --> 31:32.315
The spacing between
the paintings was all wrong.

31:32.350 --> 31:33.544
In the photograph,

31:33.590 --> 31:35.012
they were approximately
18 centimeters apart.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.312
In the room, 12 centimeters.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.453
There also hang lower now
by about ten centimeters.

31:39.490 --> 31:41.048
Someone took
them all down,

31:41.100 --> 31:42.328
put them
back up again,

31:42.360 --> 31:43.349
didn't get the
measurements right.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.197
So, Himali moved them?

31:45.230 --> 31:47.289
She says she hasn't had any work
done in that room,

31:47.330 --> 31:49.366
and when I took the frames
off the wall,

31:49.400 --> 31:51.459
I saw that she was right--
there's no old nail holes

31:51.510 --> 31:53.432
that correspond to the frames'
original arrangement.

31:53.470 --> 31:55.574
There is, however,
a slight bulge.

31:55.610 --> 31:57.202
Bulge?

31:57.240 --> 31:58.639
The center
of the wall is almost

31:58.680 --> 32:00.045
imperceptibly convex.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.241
Why? Because the gasses released

32:02.280 --> 32:04.009
from Pradeep Singh's
decomposing body

32:04.050 --> 32:06.348
expanded the plastic sheeting
that he's wrapped in,

32:06.390 --> 32:07.414
pushing outwards.

32:07.450 --> 32:08.951
Wait a second.

32:08.990 --> 32:11.356
Are you telling me that Pradeep
is in that wall?

32:11.390 --> 32:13.119
That would explain
the mold, too.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.390
_ No_.
His killer _
removed insulation

32:15.430 --> 32:16.954
to make space for his body.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.627
This created _
a temperature differential

32:18.670 --> 32:21.161
between that section and the
others, condensation formed...

32:21.200 --> 32:22.633
Then mold.
Mmm.

32:22.670 --> 32:25.366
Four years ago,
Pradeep's murderer tore down

32:25.410 --> 32:27.332
that section of wall,
stashed him inside,

32:27.370 --> 32:29.304
and then replaced
and repainted the drywall.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.001
Are you sure?

32:31.050 --> 32:33.245
I'm fairly sure.

32:42.790 --> 32:44.519
GREGSON:
Himali Singh didn't kill
her husband.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.357
ICE confirmed
she was in Mumbai

32:46.390 --> 32:48.756
visiting family during
most of October '08.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.324
She didn't even come home

32:50.360 --> 32:52.692
until she learned
Pradeep was missmg.

32:52.730 --> 32:54.163
Whoever murdered Pradeep
at home,

32:54.200 --> 32:56.339
they knew that
his wife was out of town.

32:56.370 --> 32:58.759
Her trip would've provided
the privacy and time

32:58.810 --> 33:00.630
to kill him
and stash him away.

33:00.670 --> 33:02.399
Maybe Singh had a
coconspirator,

33:02.440 --> 33:03.634
someone he built
the bomb with.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.375
Things went south...
Mmm.

33:05.410 --> 33:06.707
That's a reasonable
theory, Captain.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.241
Problem is,
I no longer think

33:09.280 --> 33:12.044
that Pradeep had anything
to do with it.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.456
What's that--
company newsletter?

33:14.490 --> 33:16.048
Now, that is
Pradeep's desk.

33:16.090 --> 33:17.580
That is the air vent
in which the bomb

33:17.620 --> 33:19.485
was concealed,
right next to him.

33:19.530 --> 33:22.454
Now, if that had gone off
when it was supposed to in 2008,

33:22.500 --> 33:24.058
it would have turned
him into so much

33:24.100 --> 33:25.590
newly promoted
hamburger.

33:25.630 --> 33:28.394
Vanowen S.C.‘s personnel files
showed that he did not miss

33:28.440 --> 33:31.762
a single day's work until the
moment that he left for good.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.505
That means he spent
almost a week

33:33.540 --> 33:35.576
in the early part
of October 2008

33:35.610 --> 33:37.339
sitting within
spitting distance

33:37.380 --> 33:38.699
of_a live _
exploswe deVIce.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.310
You think it was
meant for him.

33:41.350 --> 33:44.547
Well, it is abundantly clear
someone wanted Pradeep dead.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.342
The question is,

33:46.390 --> 33:49.780
who would be willing to go
to such lengths and why?

33:49.820 --> 33:51.549
M.E. confirms
Pradeep Singh

33:51.590 --> 33:53.421
was killed
by a gunshot wound

33:53.460 --> 33:54.222
to the chest.

33:54.260 --> 33:56.091
Death was followed
by, and I quote,

33:56.130 --> 33:57.392
"pervasive
mummification."

33:57.430 --> 33:59.625
That's everything we
found in his pockets.

33:59.670 --> 34:01.638
It's kind of weird-- there's
a key on the key chain

34:01.670 --> 34:03.433
with a button to
unlock a car door,

34:03.470 --> 34:06.405
but it's definitely
not a car key.

34:06.440 --> 34:09.375
No, that is
a safety-deposit box key.

34:09.410 --> 34:10.775
You can tell by the teeth.

34:15.850 --> 34:19.388
GREGSON:
S.L.B.

34:19.420 --> 34:21.513
Sequoia Liberty Bank?

34:21.560 --> 34:23.710
Box number 699.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.599
Huh.

34:31.630 --> 34:33.222
Cheech and Chong's
Next Movie?

34:33.270 --> 34:34.692
Well, it's not a good movie,

34:34.740 --> 34:37.391
but it didn't make me want
to commit a homicide.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.766
Hmm, the movie is gone.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.300
You see this slot here?

34:42.340 --> 34:43.432
That's there to stop you

34:43.480 --> 34:44.708
from recording
over the tape.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.241
You put Scotch tape there,
it allows you to do so.

34:47.280 --> 34:51.114
Now all we got to do is
find a VCR... in 2012.

34:51.150 --> 34:53.141
Have you not been to my home
yet, Detective Bell?

34:53.190 --> 34:55.181
I maintain several VCRs.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.679
I like to watch
police interrogations

34:59.730 --> 35:01.550
from the '705 and '805.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.421
Techniques were rawer
back then, and, uh, you do,

35:04.470 --> 35:06.461
on occasion, learn
something useful.
(phone ringing)

35:06.500 --> 35:07.762
Oh.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.461
This is one of my CIs;
I've been waiting

35:09.500 --> 35:10.831
to hear from him
on another case.

35:10.870 --> 35:12.337
You mind if I take this
in private?

35:12.370 --> 35:13.860
My parlor is at your disposal.

35:13.910 --> 35:16.174
What up, Carlo?

35:16.210 --> 35:17.837
Mm-hmm.

35:17.880 --> 35:22.317
So, listen, I texted Alfredo,
and we're all set for tomorrow.

35:22.350 --> 35:24.215
Coffee at 9:00.

35:24.250 --> 35:27.378
Alfredo, yeah, uh, I don't think
that's going to work out.

35:27.420 --> 35:29.217
Spark's no longer there.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.785
I think I'm going to have
to seek sponsorship elsewhere.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.889
What are you talking about?
You hand-picked him.

35:33.930 --> 35:36.251
Hmm, we can do better.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.568
Is this about us?

35:41.600 --> 35:43.568
Is what about us?
Your reluctance
to find a sponsor.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.602
I'm starting to think
you're being difficult

35:45.640 --> 35:47.232
because you don't want me
to leave.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.578
You never told me
you were funny.

35:48.610 --> 35:49.577
You picked Alfredo
because you thought

35:49.610 --> 35:51.544
I wasn't gonna like him,

35:51.580 --> 35:53.548
but now that I do, you're trying
to push him away, too.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.218
(laughs)
Okay, what you're
feeling right now--

35:55.250 --> 35:56.672
I've seen
it before.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.187
Clients start
to worry about what

35:58.220 --> 35:59.687
their lives _
are gang to be like

35:59.720 --> 36:00.846
after their
companion leaves.

36:00.890 --> 36:02.653
They kind of get a
separation anxiety.

36:02.690 --> 36:04.521
It's pretty standard, actually.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.425
I guess, since you've never
been anything

36:06.460 --> 36:08.325
but opposed to me
being here, it...

36:08.360 --> 36:11.659
it never occurred to me
that you might feel it, too.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.588
I don't know what you're on,

36:13.630 --> 36:15.666
but old me would definitely
have wanted some.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.691
Listen, I am...
You're back. Excellent.

36:25.780 --> 36:27.839
(knocking at door)

36:32.820 --> 36:34.685
BELL:
Hey, is that Pradeep?

36:34.720 --> 36:35.755
WATSON:
He looks about...

36:35.790 --> 36:37.212
25 years old there.

36:37.260 --> 36:38.625
WOMAN :_
Hey, sweetie.

36:38.660 --> 36:40.548
I'm so glad we finally
got to have this date.

36:40.590 --> 36:42.353
Me, too.
You ready to party?

36:42.400 --> 36:43.822
Yes.
She's a prostitute.

36:43.860 --> 36:45.623
That's interesting.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.558
High-end, by
the looks of it.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.806
You want to help me with this?
Sure.

36:57.510 --> 36:59.774
Hello, Ms. Vanowen.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.252
Well, we can keep watching
if you'd both like,

37:08.290 --> 37:10.679
but I'd say we've
found our bomber.

37:15.900 --> 37:19.666
All this just so you can
ask me a few questions?

37:19.700 --> 37:23.659
Just a consent form, ma'am.
Standard procedure.

37:23.700 --> 37:27.409
So, now you want to tell me
what this is all about?

37:27.440 --> 37:30.739
(on tape):
Hey, sweetie. I'm so glad we
finally got to have this date.

37:30.780 --> 37:31.974
Me, too.
Ready to party?

37:32.010 --> 37:33.648
Yes.
Good.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.739
I'm sorry. Was that
supposed to be me?

37:35.780 --> 37:37.748
_I've learned
Since we spoke

37:37.780 --> 37:40.044
that you come from
modest origins.

37:40.090 --> 37:42.718
Father a contractor,
mother a homemaker.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.058
So, when you got
into business school,

37:45.090 --> 37:46.580
you needed
a source of income.

37:46.630 --> 37:48.359
Something to pay
your tuition

37:48.400 --> 37:51.494
and provide you with
seed money for your company.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.725
You turned,
in your hour of need,

37:53.770 --> 37:55.931
to the world‘s
oldest profe55ion.

37:55.970 --> 37:59.667
Took to it with
some gusto, I'd say.

37:59.710 --> 38:02.907
Okay, let's turn this off.

38:02.940 --> 38:06.444
You built a successful
new life for yourself

38:06.480 --> 38:09.745
on the ashes of your old one,
and no one was any the wiser.

38:09.780 --> 38:14.513
Until Pradeep Singh
got a job at Vanowen.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.516
It probably took him
a while to realize

38:16.560 --> 38:18.585
that his new boss
was one of the women

38:18.630 --> 38:20.586
that he had secretly
recorded years ago,

38:20.630 --> 38:23.622
but when he did,
he turned the screw.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.799
So to speak.

38:25.830 --> 38:27.718
Mmm. Three promotions in a year?

38:27.770 --> 38:29.863
That smells like a payoff to me.

38:29.900 --> 38:33.768
No. I promoted Pradeep
because he deserved it.

38:33.810 --> 38:37.109
Small confession:

38:37.140 --> 38:39.574
I find the anti-
prostitution laws

38:39.610 --> 38:41.009
in this country
rather Victorian.

38:41.050 --> 38:42.813
Sex is a commodity.

38:42.850 --> 38:44.784
Why shouldn't there
be a market for it?

38:44.820 --> 38:47.812
But, of course,
not everyone thinks like I do.

38:47.850 --> 38:49.784
Which is why

38:49.820 --> 38:51.720
you had to pay Pradeep
until his demands

38:51.760 --> 38:54.923
escalated past the point
that you could meet them.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.997
Then you cast about
for a way to kill him.

38:59.830 --> 39:02.958
Now, you already had threatening
letters from the ELM.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.798
So you built a pipe bomb,
planning to blame them.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.398
But when it didn't detonate,

39:07.440 --> 39:09.829
you simply shot Pradeep
and walled him off.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.802
I imagine it was your father

39:11.850 --> 39:13.738
who taught you
how to hang drywall.

39:15.750 --> 39:18.719
That's very creative,
I'll give you that much.

39:18.750 --> 39:21.753
Can he just sling mud at me
like this?

39:21.790 --> 39:23.985
You can _seek counsel
at any time, ma'am.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.726
Hardly surprising
that you were the one

39:25.760 --> 39:27.819
to lead the search for new
offices for Vanowen S.C.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.555
You were, after all,
the only person who knew

39:29.600 --> 39:30.726
that there was an
unexploded bomb in the wall.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.660
You know what?

39:32.700 --> 39:35.737
I think I will
actually call my lawyer.

39:35.770 --> 39:36.862
Well, if you do,
Ms. Vanowen,

39:36.900 --> 39:38.436
you might want
to tell him

39:38.470 --> 39:39.903
you're about
to be arrested.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.499
You have an old videotape
and some stupid theories.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.778
This is not evidence.

39:45.810 --> 39:47.141
Yes, well,
I found something

39:47.180 --> 39:48.818
on one of the
scraps of paper

39:48.850 --> 39:50.545
that was used to
pack the bomb.

39:50.580 --> 39:52.138
An imprint of the
word "Novocain."

39:52.190 --> 39:54.044
Useful handwriting sample,

39:54.090 --> 39:56.149
but the message itself,
rather opaque.

39:56.190 --> 39:59.455
Until one considers your love
of crosswords. Novocain.

39:59.490 --> 40:01.526
The answer to 144 across

40:01.560 --> 40:03.528
from the New York Times
crossword,

40:03.560 --> 40:05.027
October 13, 2008.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.789
The clue was "pain's enemy,"
in case you forgot.

40:07.830 --> 40:09.764
HOLMES:
Now, Detective Bell and the
Questioned Documents Unit

40:09.800 --> 40:13.566
have just matched it to a
handwriting sample you gave us

40:13.610 --> 40:15.601
when you signed
your consent form.

40:15.640 --> 40:19.007
Mmm. Detective Bell,
the honor is all yours.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.917
Ms. Vanowen, would you
face that way, please?

40:23.920 --> 40:25.808
You are under arrest
for the bombing

40:25.850 --> 40:28.182
that took the lives
of David Preston and Roy Smalls.

40:28.220 --> 40:30.108
(doorbell rings)

40:36.900 --> 40:39.027
This is a surprise.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.924
I was on my way over
to show you something,

40:40.970 --> 40:42.039
then I got your message.

40:42.070 --> 40:44.959
Yeah, well... nothing personal.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.137
I don't take it
personal. It's okay.

40:47.170 --> 40:48.933
But since I'm here...

40:50.880 --> 40:52.973
Ever since I got
straightened out,

40:53.010 --> 40:55.069
I've been picking up
work with car companies.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.917
I test their
security systems.

40:56.950 --> 40:59.248
I guess they figure anything
that can keep me out

40:59.290 --> 41:01.087
is good enough for
their customers.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.127
Miss Watson tells me_that
you're into lock-picking.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.549
I figure maybe you
want to give it a shot.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.056
Well, the truth is, Alfredo,

41:10.100 --> 41:12.762
I'm already quite adept
at defeating security systems.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.961
This stuff's not even
on the market yet.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.865
So, really...

41:16.900 --> 41:18.868
how would you know
if you could beat it?

41:26.280 --> 41:29.215
You know
you want to try.

41:29.250 --> 41:31.172
Obviously your idea.

41:31.220 --> 41:33.245
Zeroing in on
common ground.

41:33.290 --> 41:35.758
Hoping it's enough
to make me reconsider him.

41:35.790 --> 41:37.519
It won't be.

41:37.560 --> 41:40.484
What's the harm in getting
to know the guy?

41:42.560 --> 41:43.925
One way or the other,

41:43.960 --> 41:46.099
I'm gonna be out
of your life in a few weeks.

41:47.230 --> 41:48.993
Maybe you're
dreading that day;

41:49.040 --> 41:51.907
maybe you're counting
the seconds.

41:51.940 --> 41:53.999
Either way,
I'm going to make sure

41:54.040 --> 41:57.168
you're ready
when the time comes.

41:57.210 --> 41:58.643
I promise.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.584
IfI help him
with his assignment,

42:05.620 --> 42:07.941
it does not mean I am assenting
to his sponsorship.

42:07.990 --> 42:09.150
Of course it doesn't.

42:09.190 --> 42:11.078
I am quite self-sufficient.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.122
Of course you are.

42:28.210 --> 42:29.905
Factory-installed
immobilizer

42:29.940 --> 42:32.044
or after-market
tracking system?

42:32.080 --> 42:33.877
Not telling.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.638
That's quite all right.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.945
I'll just figure it out
for myself.

42:40.990 --> 42:42.878
I'm entirely
self-sufficient, you know.
