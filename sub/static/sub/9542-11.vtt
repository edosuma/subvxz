00:16.888 --> 00:18.307
You're awake.

00:18.342 --> 00:20.131
Not quite.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.437
Do you have your,
um, art class today?

00:25.918 --> 00:28.510
Life in the fast lane.

00:36.386 --> 00:38.396
What?

00:38.431 --> 00:40.845
I'm just adoring you.

00:41.451 --> 00:46.009
Isn't a husband allowed to
stop and adore his wife?

00:47.474 --> 00:49.674
How did I get to be so lucky?

00:49.709 --> 00:52.129
We both got lucky, Henry.

00:58.802 --> 01:01.853
- I was listening to that.
- I'm just turning it down.

01:01.923 --> 01:03.268
You don't mind.

01:05.215 --> 01:06.810
I have to go to the office
for a couple of hours.

01:06.845 --> 01:07.969
Of course.

01:08.004 --> 01:11.684
Oh, and, uh, don't forget we're
having dinner with Father Hatcher.

01:13.354 --> 01:14.891
Again?

01:31.101 --> 01:33.246
Honey, not there.
Over here.

01:49.105 --> 01:51.514
I thought that could
have been the big one.

01:51.549 --> 01:54.761
Why don't you turn on the news,
see how bad it was.

01:54.796 --> 01:56.471
I'll check the house.

02:04.823 --> 02:07.558
Look, there's a crack over here.
Do you see it?

02:07.593 --> 02:09.751
It runs all the way across here,
and it's gonna...

02:09.786 --> 02:11.484
Christine, what are you...
No.! No.!

02:32.540 --> 02:34.228
Well, Henry...

02:34.263 --> 02:36.508
That was a big one.

02:41.106 --> 02:45.053
MONK Season 1 Epi. 10
Mr. Monk and the Earthquake

03:27.800 --> 03:30.083
Oh, thank God!
Thank God!

03:30.118 --> 03:33.316
No, no, no.
Stay at Kenny's, Benjy! Stay there!

03:33.351 --> 03:35.508
I just got to check out Mr. Monk.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.582
Adrian!

03:41.784 --> 03:43.320
Ad...

03:46.934 --> 03:48.262
You okay?

03:48.297 --> 03:51.644
I've been trying to call you for
over an hour. Your phone is dead.

03:52.561 --> 03:54.355
Are you sure you're okay?

04:00.954 --> 04:02.759
Oh, my God.

04:04.227 --> 04:05.449
What? Benjy?

04:05.484 --> 04:06.287
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:06.322 --> 04:09.043
He's okay. He was at school
when it happened and he loved it.

04:09.078 --> 04:11.654
He thought it was
like a roller coaster.

04:13.985 --> 04:15.614
Adrian,

04:15.649 --> 04:17.188
I have to tell you
I'm very impressed.

04:17.223 --> 04:20.446
I mean, I thought you'd be
a basket case. Everything's broken.

04:20.940 --> 04:22.600
Where were you
when it happened?

04:27.177 --> 04:28.843
What?

04:38.538 --> 04:40.438
Are you okay?

04:45.743 --> 04:47.359
Adrian,

04:48.330 --> 04:50.017
you're not speaking English.

04:50.052 --> 04:51.390
You know that, right?

04:59.660 --> 05:02.462
Yeah, yeah.
Sharona, relax.

05:02.497 --> 05:04.666
He's having
a dissociative episode.

05:04.701 --> 05:06.596
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Dissociative?

05:06.631 --> 05:09.625
Yeah. The trauma of the
earthquake probably shorted out

05:09.660 --> 05:12.415
the occipital lobe in the
left hemisphere of his brain,

05:12.450 --> 05:15.328
which controls the ability
to speak and to form words.

05:15.363 --> 05:16.817
Well, what should I do?

05:16.852 --> 05:19.125
Look, he thinks
he's speaking normally.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.567
He's more confused
than you are.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.744
Right. Okay, well, now...
I-I can see him, uh,

05:24.779 --> 05:26.499
tomorrow at 4:00 if you like,

05:26.534 --> 05:29.554
but I gotta tell ya I wouldn't
be surprised if he's fine by then.

05:29.589 --> 05:31.536
I mean, these things
usually pass on their own.

05:31.571 --> 05:34.929
The most important thing...
just don't leave him alone.

05:34.964 --> 05:36.218
Okay.

05:37.516 --> 05:38.858
Wait... Will you wait?

05:38.893 --> 05:41.074
Okay, hold on.
Hold on. He...

05:41.109 --> 05:42.728
He wants to speak to you.

05:48.029 --> 05:49.734
You're talking gibberish.

05:49.769 --> 05:52.549
Adrian, I can't understand
a word you're saying.

05:54.466 --> 05:58.118
Right. Good. Okay, so put
Sharona on the phone, okay?

05:58.153 --> 06:00.763
Including well-known
philanthropist Henry Rutherford,

06:00.798 --> 06:03.482
who's best known for
his Rutherford Scholarships,

06:03.517 --> 06:07.131
which enabled hundreds of inner-city
children from across the country...

06:07.166 --> 06:08.692
Oh, my God.

06:11.401 --> 06:12.829
Okay.

06:12.864 --> 06:14.952
Henry Rutherford.

06:15.913 --> 06:18.929
I told you about him. I've been
working with him the whole month.

06:18.964 --> 06:23.764
He was a deacon at my church. He was
trying to make money for the new church.

06:23.799 --> 06:26.395
Oh, my God. I know his wife.
She's gonna be devastated.

06:27.658 --> 06:28.914
I gotta go.

06:31.196 --> 06:33.433
They live two blocks away.
She just moved here.

06:33.468 --> 06:35.904
She doesn't know anybody.
I'm gonna see if they need my help, okay?

06:35.939 --> 06:37.438
Just stay here.

06:40.076 --> 06:42.930
You know what? On second thought,
you better come with me. Come on.

06:45.745 --> 06:47.992
Doctor Kroger?
We'll call you back.

06:48.027 --> 06:49.190
Fine.

06:52.006 --> 06:53.795
And he had a brother in London.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.757
They weren't close, but
somebody should call him.

06:55.792 --> 06:58.287
Don't worry, Christine.
I'll take care of it.

06:58.322 --> 06:59.594
Thank you, Father.

06:59.629 --> 07:02.380
I don't know what I'd do
without you and Sharona.

07:04.488 --> 07:06.099
It was terrible.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.397
The whole room started to shake,

07:08.432 --> 07:10.802
and Henry made sure
I was safe in the doorway.

07:10.837 --> 07:13.149
Now you mustn't torture yourself.

07:13.184 --> 07:15.598
The wall unit started
to come tipping over,

07:15.633 --> 07:18.641
and Henry was trying
to keep it from falling.

07:18.676 --> 07:21.162
I saw it come crashing down.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.766
I called for help but there was
nobody else in the house.

07:25.671 --> 07:27.472
Okay, here you go.

07:28.183 --> 07:29.566
Oh, I-I couldn't.

07:29.601 --> 07:31.584
No, no, Christine.
You have to have something.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.365
She's right, Christine.
You must stay strong.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.648
You know, I could
stay here tonight.

07:36.683 --> 07:38.345
Thank you.
That's very sweet.

07:38.380 --> 07:41.443
But I called my mother in Chicago.
She'll be here later tonight.

07:41.478 --> 07:43.672
Oh, that-that's good.

07:43.698 --> 07:46.113
Mothers are great to talk to.

07:46.148 --> 07:48.300
Well, you know,
except for mine.

07:52.876 --> 07:55.735
This is my boss,
Adrian Monk.

08:03.474 --> 08:06.411
Adrian, why don't
you wait in the other room?

08:08.646 --> 08:10.688
Adrian, go in the other room.

08:15.105 --> 08:16.400
Where is he from?

08:16.435 --> 08:17.620
Neptune.

08:20.058 --> 08:24.396
You know that everybody from the church
is here for you in your time of need.

09:05.870 --> 09:08.553
Oh, she'll be all right. It's...

09:08.802 --> 09:10.449
What are you doing?

09:12.903 --> 09:14.867
Not right about this room.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.589
Adrian, you can talk!

09:17.624 --> 09:20.756
Of course I can talk.
What is wrong with you?

09:20.954 --> 09:23.262
Nothing is wrong with me.

09:25.168 --> 09:26.863
There is no third watch.

09:26.898 --> 09:31.276
I want everybody on active duty... to
report to their watch commanders, got it?

09:31.311 --> 09:32.628
- All right.
- You follow me?

09:32.663 --> 09:36.326
Yes. Christine Rutherford sat
around waiting for an earthquake?

09:36.361 --> 09:40.064
No, no, no, no. She sat around
waiting for her rich, old husband to die,

09:40.099 --> 09:42.316
and when the earthquake hit...

09:42.351 --> 09:43.349
You see?
Captain,

09:43.384 --> 09:46.168
when the earthquake hit,
she realized it was her chance...

09:46.203 --> 09:48.455
a one-in-a-million shot...
and she took it.

09:48.490 --> 09:51.545
Captain, we have reports of
some looting in Potrero Hill.

09:51.580 --> 09:55.719
All right, get 10 uniforms down there.
I want a man on every corner. Go. Go.

09:56.032 --> 09:58.155
There was ceiling
debris all over the floor

09:58.156 --> 10:00.423
but none on the back of
a fallen display case.

10:01.369 --> 10:02.931
And there were marks on the wall like

10:02.932 --> 10:04.958
somebody used a lever
to knock that case over.

10:04.993 --> 10:06.293
- Really?
- Captain!

10:06.328 --> 10:07.522
Captain, Cargill.

10:08.993 --> 10:10.910
- Yeah?
- Those calls are false alarms.

10:10.945 --> 10:12.505
I don't care if
they're all false alarms.

10:12.540 --> 10:14.380
You've got to check 'em out.
Every one.

10:14.415 --> 10:15.627
Yes, sir.

10:16.246 --> 10:19.248
Look, Monk, there was an earthquake.
That's what earthquakes do.

10:19.283 --> 10:20.383
They knock crap over.

10:20.418 --> 10:24.502
Yes, b-but there were other pictures
on the same wall and none of them...

10:24.537 --> 10:26.133
none of them were even crooked.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.800
I'm trying to put out
a hundred fires here, Monk.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.321
I realize that. - Where's the guy
from Emergency Services?

10:30.356 --> 10:31.964
Look out. Look out.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.001
Look, somebody will be
with you soon enough.

10:34.036 --> 10:35.487
Please, everybody just sit down.
Calm down.

10:35.522 --> 10:36.651
She could be there...

10:36.686 --> 10:38.893
She could be there right now
cleaning up all the evidence.

10:38.928 --> 10:41.437
At least send a couple
of detectives to look around.

10:41.472 --> 10:44.285
I haven't got a detective.
I haven't got a moment to spare.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.176
Monk, the shaking you felt
this morning was a 6.0 earthquake.

10:48.311 --> 10:51.281
But at least send me
over to check it out.

10:51.684 --> 10:54.276
- Where's Sharona?
- She went to pick up her kid.

10:55.044 --> 10:56.819
All right.
Uh, Lieutenant?

10:56.854 --> 10:59.003
I'm officially handing
Monk off to you.

10:59.038 --> 11:00.885
I want you to give him
anything he needs.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.419
And quit screwing around
and get back to work.

11:10.033 --> 11:11.276
Sorry, the street's closed.

11:11.311 --> 11:12.446
What's going on?

11:12.481 --> 11:14.898
The gas line's ruptured,
and all the phone lines are down.

11:14.933 --> 11:17.125
These two blocks were
the worst ones hit.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.562
God. Look, we
just live over there.

11:19.597 --> 11:21.319
Not today you don't.

11:21.354 --> 11:24.046
Call Emergency Services.

11:24.168 --> 11:26.197
Here's their number.

11:28.226 --> 11:29.758
How long is this gonna be?

11:29.793 --> 11:31.637
Oh, maybe a couple of days.

11:31.672 --> 11:34.174
- A couple of days?
- Maybe three.

11:34.209 --> 11:36.054
Just call that number, ma'am.

11:36.089 --> 11:37.226
I just work here.

11:37.261 --> 11:40.199
Officer, I'm with the Melbourne Gazette.
Can I get in and get a couple shots?

11:40.234 --> 11:42.179
I'm sorry.
No one can get through.

11:42.214 --> 11:44.442
Look, can we just go in
and get some stuff?

11:44.477 --> 11:46.394
I mean, what if he needs
some medicine or something?

11:46.429 --> 11:50.068
Ma'am, you have to
call that number. Okay?

11:50.103 --> 11:51.772
That's all I know.

11:52.265 --> 11:53.873
Now please, step back.

11:55.583 --> 11:57.307
There's a delightful chap.

11:57.342 --> 11:58.643
He reminds me of my ex-wife.

11:58.678 --> 12:00.296
Yeah, he reminds me
of my ex-husband.

12:00.331 --> 12:02.174
Maybe we should
get 'em together.

12:02.526 --> 12:05.559
- Mom, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know. I don't know.

12:05.594 --> 12:08.665
I guess we're gonna have
to find a hotel. - Good luck.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.171
I've been calling all morning.

12:10.206 --> 12:12.577
There's nary a room left
in the whole city.

12:12.911 --> 12:14.663
"Nary a room"?

12:14.790 --> 12:15.937
That's what I said.

12:15.972 --> 12:19.588
Well, we can always
stay at Aunt Gail's.

12:19.830 --> 12:21.401
Why can't we stay
at Mr. Monk's?

12:21.436 --> 12:24.378
Because I will go crazy
slower at Aunt Gail's.

12:24.413 --> 12:27.676
Do you think your Aunt Gail has
a room for an out-of-town journalist?

12:27.711 --> 12:29.076
I'm Darryl Wright.

12:29.111 --> 12:30.670
I'm Sharona.

12:30.705 --> 12:33.468
Yeah, I'm sorry.
My sister has no room.

12:33.792 --> 12:35.320
Is this your boyfriend?

12:35.355 --> 12:38.267
No. This is, uh, my son, Benjy.

12:38.387 --> 12:40.551
You thought
I was her boyfriend?

12:40.586 --> 12:41.817
He's joking.

12:41.852 --> 12:45.799
Listen, my editor just called.
He wants me to do a story on the quake.

12:45.834 --> 12:48.957
What do say to you and Benjy here?
A bit of local color.

12:48.992 --> 12:50.594
Oh, yeah. We'd love to.

12:50.629 --> 12:52.891
- Great. Start with a picture?
- Okay.

12:55.565 --> 12:58.248
Do you believe in
love at first sight?

13:06.652 --> 13:10.808
Personally, I never did.

13:11.777 --> 13:14.693
And then you got a look
at my husband's bank account...

13:14.728 --> 13:17.910
And zing went the
strings of my heart.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.836
There we were, just waiting
for the right opportunity,

13:28.871 --> 13:31.663
and God dropped
it right in our laps.

13:31.698 --> 13:33.998
The bloody miracle.

13:34.866 --> 13:38.472
$42.5 million.

13:38.552 --> 13:40.586
Say it again.

13:41.368 --> 13:43.404
Forty-two...

13:43.439 --> 13:45.888
Point five...

13:45.923 --> 13:48.325
million dollars.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.665
I love it when you talk dirty.

13:53.736 --> 13:57.018
Just one more loose end
to tie up, and it's all ours.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.882
Sharona.

13:59.010 --> 14:00.649
Sharona.

14:00.684 --> 14:02.279
She's pretty.

14:02.314 --> 14:04.176
Didn't notice.

14:04.541 --> 14:06.658
Are you sure
she trusts you?

14:06.693 --> 14:09.277
God.

14:09.312 --> 14:11.522
Why wouldn't she trust me?

14:16.200 --> 14:17.595
- Sharona.
- Hey, butter bean!

14:17.630 --> 14:20.262
Hi. - Gail, I am so sorry.
I didn't know who else to call.

14:20.297 --> 14:21.631
Hey, no problem.

14:21.666 --> 14:24.129
That's what I'm here for.
It's gonna be fun.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.634
I just talked to Mom.
She's freakin' out.

14:26.669 --> 14:28.946
She heard some guy
on CNN talk about aftershocks.

14:28.981 --> 14:31.663
- I could not get her off the phone.
- You should get caller I. D.

14:31.698 --> 14:33.741
I have caller I. D.
I had it before you.

14:33.776 --> 14:36.718
- No, you didn't.
- I told you about caller I. D.

14:36.753 --> 14:39.878
What? I had caller I. D.
When I lived in Valencia.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.492
Remember, you came over
and I showed you how it worked?

14:41.527 --> 14:44.220
I had caller I. D. When I was
living with Lenny in Seattle.

14:44.255 --> 14:46.781
- Okay, you never told me that.
- I know. I was avoiding your calls.

14:46.816 --> 14:49.089
- I had caller I. D.
- Mom. Aunt Gail.

14:49.124 --> 14:50.894
Can we go inside, please?

14:52.270 --> 14:56.172
Gail, remember when I went out to
visit Mom when she broke her wrist?

14:56.207 --> 15:00.006
Yeah. - And remember you
said that you owe me big time?

15:00.038 --> 15:01.608
Mm... Remember?

15:05.348 --> 15:08.953
Oh, no. - I swear. I swear.
He's gonna be good.

15:08.988 --> 15:11.216
Come on! Come on.

15:11.251 --> 15:12.630
You know, he's not
as bad as he was.

15:12.665 --> 15:14.579
He's just freaked out
about this earthquake.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.266
I can't leave him alone.

15:16.470 --> 15:18.180
I guess he can sleep
on the couch.

15:18.215 --> 15:20.198
Well, actually he's gonna
need the guest room.

15:20.233 --> 15:23.040
He doesn't sleep on couches.

15:23.075 --> 15:25.519
Gail, I spent two weeks with Mom.

15:25.627 --> 15:27.144
Now we're even.

15:27.324 --> 15:29.200
It's going to be okay, Adrian.

15:29.258 --> 15:30.768
- Hi, Gail.
- Hi.

15:30.867 --> 15:34.161
Listen, don't worry about Sharona.
She won't get in the way.

15:35.898 --> 15:37.164
Even.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.803
- Yes, thank you. I'll hold.
- You Know, I like those earrings.

15:42.838 --> 15:44.422
You ought to.
You gave them to me.

15:44.457 --> 15:46.658
Oh, I forgot.

15:48.436 --> 15:50.824
So, um, are you still
seeing that actor?

15:50.859 --> 15:53.273
Hal Myers?
Yeah, in my nightmares.

15:53.308 --> 15:54.997
You know, even in my
nightmares he can't act.

15:55.032 --> 15:57.813
I liked him. - Maybe I'm getting
too picky in my old age.

15:57.848 --> 15:59.455
How about you?
Are you in love with anybody?

15:59.490 --> 16:02.069
Well, actually,
I met somebody this morning.

16:02.104 --> 16:04.047
- He's a journalist.
- Really?

16:04.082 --> 16:05.717
Yeah, from Australia.

16:05.752 --> 16:07.722
- Complete with accent?
- Oh, yeah.

16:07.757 --> 16:09.692
The full package.
He's to die for.

16:09.727 --> 16:12.069
Ooh, bring him by.
I'd love to meet him.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.463
I'm sure you would.

16:16.439 --> 16:17.853
What is he doing?

16:17.888 --> 16:19.742
He's counting the bricks in the wall.

16:19.777 --> 16:22.860
Oh, good. You know, I've
always been curious about that.

16:26.634 --> 16:29.577
Adrian, don't tie up Gail's line.

16:29.612 --> 16:32.877
I'm on hold.
I'm waiting for Disher.

16:39.934 --> 16:41.706
Oh, crap!

16:42.091 --> 16:45.577
One, two, three...

16:46.569 --> 16:47.783
Is that new?

16:47.818 --> 16:50.472
I got it a couple of weeks ago.
My other was too big.

16:50.507 --> 16:52.198
Check it out!

16:53.140 --> 16:54.165
When did you get that?

16:54.200 --> 16:56.864
Two months ago.
Like you didn't know!

16:56.899 --> 17:01.377
What? Y-You think I'd buy
the same handbag on purpose?

17:02.264 --> 17:04.310
Now why would I do that?

17:05.165 --> 17:07.227
What? You think I wanna...
I want to be like you?

17:07.262 --> 17:08.964
Like I'm obsessed with you?

17:08.999 --> 17:11.088
Who moved to
San Francisco first?

17:11.123 --> 17:13.945
Oh, my God!
You begged me to move up here!

17:13.981 --> 17:17.272
Hey! Do I have to
separate you two?

17:17.751 --> 17:20.805
Yeah. It's... Lieutenant, yes,
I'm here. I'm still here.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.595
Yeah, I need her phone records.

17:23.699 --> 17:29.315
Every call from that house and
her cell phone for the last two weeks.

17:29.919 --> 17:33.220
Right. Right.

17:33.255 --> 17:35.948
And what about
the background check?

17:37.672 --> 17:40.085
Really?

17:40.220 --> 17:42.074
Really?

17:44.085 --> 17:45.101
Hello?

17:45.136 --> 17:46.171
Sharona.

17:46.206 --> 17:49.418
Uh, no. This is her, uh,
younger sister, Gail.

17:49.453 --> 17:50.861
Really?

17:52.815 --> 17:54.901
You two sound so much alike.

17:54.936 --> 17:55.803
Do you look alike?

17:55.838 --> 17:58.322
No. I'm the sexy one.

17:58.357 --> 17:59.823
Really?

17:59.986 --> 18:02.606
Hey, are you the Australian guy
she met on the street?

18:02.641 --> 18:05.915
Yeah, that would be me,
unless she met somebody else.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.621
What are you eating?

18:07.656 --> 18:10.707
Rice cakes.
God, I hate this diet.

18:10.742 --> 18:12.820
Being the sexy sister is
a hard yacker.

18:12.855 --> 18:15.017
That's a full-time job.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.784
Listen, is Sharona there?

18:16.819 --> 18:17.844
You just missed her.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.965
She and her boss had some
business at St. Claire's Church.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.197
Saint Claire's?

18:22.232 --> 18:24.728
Yeah, you know,
the one on Fulton Street.

18:53.243 --> 18:54.927
That's quite a performance.

18:54.962 --> 18:56.652
Look, you don't know her.

18:56.687 --> 18:59.810
She and her husband
practically saved this church.

19:00.003 --> 19:01.896
They're like saints.

19:01.931 --> 19:04.550
Your saint didn't pay
for her candle.

19:09.834 --> 19:11.093
Mrs. Rutherford...

19:11.128 --> 19:13.604
Mr. Monk. Sharona.

19:13.639 --> 19:15.591
Would you light a candle
for my husband?

19:15.626 --> 19:17.461
I'd love to.

19:19.781 --> 19:21.720
Which husband?

19:22.498 --> 19:25.611
I understand that
Henry was your third.

19:27.075 --> 19:28.761
Excuse me.

19:28.855 --> 19:30.822
Mrs. Rutherford, in 1997,

19:30.857 --> 19:34.415
you and your second husband
were indicted for mail fraud in Nevada.

19:34.450 --> 19:36.345
Indictment's not
a conviction, Mr. Monk.

19:36.380 --> 19:37.441
A stirring defense.

19:37.476 --> 19:40.026
But Henry didn't know about
your other marriages, did he?

19:40.061 --> 19:41.205
Of course he did.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.025
I saw the photographs
in your house, ma'am.

19:43.060 --> 19:44.558
Watch your step, ma'am.

19:45.006 --> 19:48.572
You were married at the
Sacred Cross Chapel in Chicago.

19:48.607 --> 19:51.691
Henry was a deacon there,
and even if he wanted to,

19:51.726 --> 19:55.237
he couldn't have knowingly
married a divorcee.

19:55.468 --> 19:59.984
Okay. You got me.
I kept a secret from my husband.

20:03.689 --> 20:04.937
Beg your pardon.

20:08.615 --> 20:10.346
Sharona.

20:11.746 --> 20:13.368
What are you doin' here?

20:13.403 --> 20:14.884
I called the number you gave me.

20:14.919 --> 20:16.963
Your sister told me
where you were,

20:16.998 --> 20:18.910
and I was a couple
blocks away, so...

20:18.945 --> 20:20.078
As you do.

20:20.113 --> 20:22.717
Well, it-it-it's great
to see you. Yeah.

20:22.752 --> 20:24.458
And you too.

20:25.379 --> 20:27.173
Oh, I'm sorry. Um,

20:27.506 --> 20:30.033
Darryl Wright, this is
my boss, Adrian Monk.

20:30.068 --> 20:31.126
How do you do?

20:32.724 --> 20:35.480
Darryl is a journalist
from Australia.

20:35.515 --> 20:37.539
He's doing a story
about the earthquake.

20:37.574 --> 20:39.963
Speaking of the earthquake,
are you back in your apartment yet?

20:39.998 --> 20:43.267
Uh, no. Not yet. They said
maybe Monday. - Monday.

20:43.302 --> 20:47.478
Right. So, uh, who was the...
who was the widow?

20:47.513 --> 20:49.421
Christine Rutherford.

20:49.774 --> 20:51.120
Now why does that
name ring a bell?

20:51.155 --> 20:54.367
Her husband was
worth about $40 million.

20:54.402 --> 20:58.762
And I think she killed him.
Excuse me.

21:04.009 --> 21:08.153
He's a former detective and,
you know, he gets a little paranoid, so...

21:10.810 --> 21:12.847
Well, it sounds like
a much more interesting

21:12.848 --> 21:14.568
story than this earthquake I'm doing.

21:14.603 --> 21:17.042
- Yeah. It is.
- You can tell me all about it over dinner.

21:17.077 --> 21:20.482
- We're having dinner?
- Your sister invited me.

21:21.377 --> 21:22.949
Gail?

21:22.984 --> 21:24.609
Yeah. Is there a problem?

21:24.644 --> 21:27.925
Oh, no.
No. It's... That's great!

21:28.347 --> 21:29.889
It's fine. Yeah.

21:30.516 --> 21:32.116
Four months in the outback,

21:32.151 --> 21:35.889
110 degrees in the shade if you could
find it, sleeping on the ground.

21:35.924 --> 21:38.148
That must have been tough.

21:38.206 --> 21:39.408
What would you eat, though?

21:39.443 --> 21:43.418
We ate grubs, bugs, snakes.
Danger, danger, danger!

21:43.453 --> 21:46.237
Anyway, we finally got back.

21:46.814 --> 21:49.435
I got my messages.
It's my editor.

21:49.470 --> 21:51.730
He's telling me
he's changed his mind.

21:51.765 --> 21:53.568
He doesn't want me to go.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.079
You know, Darryl was
nominated for a Pulitzer.

21:56.114 --> 21:57.465
Really?

21:57.500 --> 21:59.868
It was a story I wrote awhile back
for the Sydney Morning Herald.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.511
Ooh, do you have a copy of it?

22:01.546 --> 22:03.801
- Not on me.
- What was it about?

22:03.836 --> 22:06.768
It was about a bridge collapse.
Five people died.

22:06.803 --> 22:10.231
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. Five people from all walks of life.

22:10.266 --> 22:14.169
It was a wealthy old woman,
an orphan, a maid.

22:14.204 --> 22:15.735
I wrote about each of them,
who they were,

22:15.770 --> 22:17.702
how they touched
different people in their lives.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.782
Oh, I'd love to read it.
You gotta send me a copy.

22:19.817 --> 22:21.240
You can't forget.

22:21.275 --> 22:23.163
- I won't.
- This is fun.

22:23.198 --> 22:24.913
I wish there was
an earthquake every week.

22:24.948 --> 22:27.740
Don't say that, sugar beet.
The earthquake killed three people.

22:27.775 --> 22:28.986
No, it didn't.

22:29.021 --> 22:30.775
Not according to Mr. Monk.

22:30.810 --> 22:32.950
He thinks one of
them was a murder.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.523
Yes. I've been meaning
to ask you about that.

22:35.558 --> 22:37.342
How is the investigation going?

22:37.377 --> 22:39.779
Well, so far, just a hunch.

22:43.201 --> 22:45.201
Hey, can we play a game after?

22:45.537 --> 22:47.498
- Uh, it's a song!
- Song.

22:49.105 --> 22:50.739
Uh, stop. Bus stop!

22:50.980 --> 22:52.564
- Stop what you're...
- Stop... Bus stop!

22:53.226 --> 22:54.912
"Stop in the Name of Love"!

22:55.859 --> 22:58.959
How did you know that?
I want you on my team!

22:59.922 --> 23:01.671
I'm gonna sit over here.

23:02.905 --> 23:06.627
Excuse me.
wh-where does this go?

23:06.662 --> 23:09.999
- Above the sink with all the others.
- Well, this one...

23:10.034 --> 23:12.366
All the others are square.
Should I just throw it away?

23:12.401 --> 23:15.199
No. Just put it down.
I'll take care of it later.

23:15.234 --> 23:16.268
Why don't you join us?

23:16.303 --> 23:17.770
Yeah. We're playing
charades. It's fun.

23:17.805 --> 23:18.846
Yeah, it'll be fun.

23:18.881 --> 23:21.889
- It's a game.
- That's right. It's a game.

23:21.924 --> 23:23.335
Benjy, it's my turn.
You take it.

23:23.370 --> 23:24.592
- Okay.
- Off you go.

23:24.627 --> 23:26.124
A fast game is a good game.

23:28.889 --> 23:31.336
- Movie! It's a movie.!
- Spider-Man.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.501
- He's right.
- Well, he's seen...

23:36.536 --> 23:40.631
he's seen the movie 20 times, and he was
just reading the comic, so I figured...

23:40.666 --> 23:43.093
He's 11 years old.
Let him have fun.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.296
Okay, I got one!

23:47.830 --> 23:49.509
- It's a movie.
- Movie.

23:49.544 --> 23:51.247
- Uh, six...
- Six words.

23:51.282 --> 23:53.231
The Man Who Came to Dinner.

23:53.569 --> 23:54.764
How did you know that?

23:54.799 --> 23:59.021
It's a movie about a houseguest
who wouldn't leave. Six words.

23:59.056 --> 24:01.030
You were looking at me.

24:01.925 --> 24:03.870
Okay, Darryl,
why don't you go next?

24:03.905 --> 24:05.548
All right. I got one.

24:05.583 --> 24:10.359
Now, instead of playing charades,
we're playing "Let's Stump Monk".

24:10.678 --> 24:12.092
Let's stump Monk.

24:12.127 --> 24:14.950
- A Bible book?
- It's a book. Right?

24:15.112 --> 24:17.055
The Bridge at San Luis Rey.

24:17.835 --> 24:19.747
Is he right?

24:19.859 --> 24:21.356
Of course he's right.

24:21.391 --> 24:23.103
You know,
why don't we watch TV?

24:23.138 --> 24:24.669
Uh, you said I'm not
allowed to watch TV.

24:24.704 --> 24:27.157
I changed my mind.
Turn it on.

24:27.192 --> 24:28.145
All right.

24:31.592 --> 24:35.140
A necessary adjunct
to the recording of all...

24:37.800 --> 24:39.345
How'd you know the
name of the book?

24:39.380 --> 24:41.891
The little story he told at dinner
about the bridge collapsing.

24:41.926 --> 24:46.164
It was a novel from the '20s
called The Bridge at San Luis Rey.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.049
Don't do this.

24:51.084 --> 24:54.549
Every time I like somebody,
you ruin it.

25:17.835 --> 25:20.015
I wasn't sure how you took it?

25:20.050 --> 25:22.408
Light and sweet.
Thanks.

25:25.613 --> 25:26.790
Excuse me.

25:29.357 --> 25:31.348
Hello? - I thought you
were going to call me.

25:31.383 --> 25:33.362
Yeah, I know. I know.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.380
It's my editor.

25:37.149 --> 25:38.477
Did you get into her place yet?

25:38.512 --> 25:39.732
I'm working on it.

25:39.767 --> 25:42.946
I am aware of the deadline,
and I know it's important.

25:42.981 --> 25:44.350
You said you've have it by tonight.

25:44.385 --> 25:45.921
Listen, mate,
the sooner I'm off this phone,

25:45.956 --> 25:47.763
the quicker I can get back to work.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.672
Correct. Bye-bye.

25:55.637 --> 25:56.827
Here you go.

26:00.086 --> 26:02.404
- You are an angel.
- Thank you.

26:09.393 --> 26:12.011
And there's no way he could
have been nominated for a Pulitzer.

26:12.046 --> 26:14.207
Maybe he's a good writer.

26:14.788 --> 26:16.576
It's not that.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.269
The Pulitzer is only
for American journalism.

26:19.304 --> 26:21.245
He said that story was
published in Australia.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.691
So what?

26:22.726 --> 26:26.827
Maybe he's trying to impress me.
Maybe he likes me.

26:27.637 --> 26:29.345
God. And you're
scaring him away.

26:29.380 --> 26:33.251
Gail's trying to seduce him, and
I'm stuck in the middle as usual.

26:33.286 --> 26:37.054
Tobor, bringing you chills
you've never known before.

26:39.111 --> 26:41.694
- Gail, where's the bathroom?
- Uh, first door on the left.

26:49.577 --> 26:53.080
All I'm saying is there's something
about that guy. Be careful.

26:53.115 --> 26:57.214
No, no. You be careful.
I am sick and tired of being careful.

27:40.114 --> 27:42.502
Son of a bitch!

27:42.537 --> 27:43.641
Excuse me.

27:44.903 --> 27:46.955
Uh, this building is offlimits.

27:47.138 --> 27:48.873
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm, uh...

27:48.908 --> 27:50.816
I'm with the phone company.

27:50.982 --> 27:53.210
I was told we had
this block to ourselves.

27:53.245 --> 27:54.494
You have a work order?

27:54.529 --> 27:56.788
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Sure I do.

27:56.823 --> 27:58.655
It's, uh...

27:59.836 --> 28:02.541
You know what?
I must have left it in my truck.

28:02.576 --> 28:04.332
I didn't see any truck.

28:04.414 --> 28:06.676
Look, wait right here.
I gotta call this in.

28:18.551 --> 28:20.740
No, my friend.
I can't let you do that.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.927
You got a name?

28:35.962 --> 28:38.375
Yep, David Bushner.
Age 44.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.798
He was a gas company tech.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.812
Stabbed, one in the chest.

28:42.847 --> 28:46.521
He went missing late last night.
Phone company crew just found him.

28:46.556 --> 28:47.653
Where is his truck?

28:47.688 --> 28:50.562
It's, uh, parked up on
Downey where he left it.

28:50.874 --> 28:54.278
We don't know if this is the murder
scene or if he was dumped here.

28:54.313 --> 28:56.193
No. He was killed
somewhere else.

28:56.228 --> 28:57.278
Are you sure?

28:57.313 --> 29:00.369
Yeah. The body's on
an incline, head down.

29:00.404 --> 29:03.749
Look at the blood stain on his chest.
Blood doesn't flow uphill.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.859
At least not in my experience.

29:05.894 --> 29:08.469
When was the last time
he was seen upright?

29:08.504 --> 29:12.324
Uh, according to his log, the last
gas line he inspected was, uh,

29:12.359 --> 29:14.969
304 Downey Road,
10:00 last night.

29:15.004 --> 29:18.514
304 Downey? That's two
doors down from Sharona's.

29:22.717 --> 29:26.747
The water's all rusty. - Oh, it gets
like that after every earthquake.

29:26.782 --> 29:31.918
But I always keep some mineral water
on hand just for emergencies.

29:33.018 --> 29:34.947
Where's all my water?

29:36.471 --> 29:38.156
Mr. Monk?

29:38.191 --> 29:39.970
Mr. Monk, are you in there?

29:40.005 --> 29:42.460
Don't come in.
I'm taking a bath.

29:42.495 --> 29:44.853
Are you taking a bath in mineral water?

29:44.888 --> 29:47.312
Uh, the tap water was a little rusty.

29:47.347 --> 29:51.659
Well, enjoy it because
that bath is costing me $95.

29:51.694 --> 29:53.742
Okay. Thank you.

29:54.584 --> 30:00.320
He can tell what you're thinking just
by how you're sitting in your chair.

30:01.744 --> 30:03.578
I should write about him.

30:03.613 --> 30:07.004
You should.
Nobody would believe it.

30:08.119 --> 30:12.068
You'd have to put it in
the science fiction section.

30:16.198 --> 30:18.060
So...

30:20.668 --> 30:22.479
What about you?

30:23.554 --> 30:25.300
What about me?

30:29.665 --> 30:33.339
Oh, hi. Can I, um...
Can I help you?

30:33.374 --> 30:37.056
Good afternoon. I'm Lieutenant
Disher, San Francisco Police.

30:37.091 --> 30:39.126
I need to speak to Adrian Monk.

30:39.161 --> 30:42.404
Oh, uh, he's in the bathroom
right now washing up.

30:42.815 --> 30:45.010
That would be Monk.

30:46.562 --> 30:48.593
I need to make sure
that he gets these.

30:48.628 --> 30:49.845
It's very important.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.795
Uh, sure. Are you, um...
Are you really a cop?

30:52.830 --> 30:55.014
Yes, I am.

30:56.324 --> 30:58.598
Look at the nice picture.

30:58.633 --> 30:59.932
Why did you get rid
of the mustache?

30:59.967 --> 31:01.885
My captain has a mustache.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.862
I shaved mine off so that
people could tell us apart.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.465
Sharona never told me
she had a sister.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.114
Younger. How long
have you known her for?

31:10.149 --> 31:11.174
Four years now.

31:11.209 --> 31:14.238
Really? And she never
mentioned me at all?

31:14.273 --> 31:16.992
Well, she's obviously
a little jealous.

31:17.027 --> 31:21.009
Exactly. Say, copper,
you like Italian food?

31:21.272 --> 31:22.592
Yeah.

31:28.769 --> 31:29.948
Hot.

31:33.894 --> 31:35.766
You know,
I dated a cop once.

31:35.801 --> 31:38.455
I still have his handcuffs
on my bedpost.

31:38.490 --> 31:42.391
Then I should inform you you are
still in possession of stolen property.

31:42.426 --> 31:44.086
I might have to bring
you down to the station.

31:44.121 --> 31:46.319
Really? I might not mind that.

31:49.921 --> 31:52.007
Here. Try this. Oh...

31:54.504 --> 31:55.810
Too spicy?

31:55.845 --> 31:58.087
- No. It's perfect.
- Oh, perfect.

32:00.435 --> 32:02.202
Uh, so, uh,

32:02.782 --> 32:05.079
what's it like having Adrian
Monk as a houseguest?

32:05.114 --> 32:08.232
Well, a few years ago,
a squirrel got into the house

32:08.267 --> 32:10.821
and I could hear it running
through the attic and the walls.

32:10.856 --> 32:13.500
It took me two months to get rid of it.
It drove me crazy.

32:13.535 --> 32:16.071
- And?
- It's like that.

32:16.106 --> 32:18.789
So are you, um...
You gonna wait for him?

32:19.576 --> 32:21.497
Monk...

32:21.766 --> 32:23.413
No, I can't.

32:23.448 --> 32:27.166
If he's washing up, he could
still be another two or three hours.

32:27.201 --> 32:29.775
I should, uh...

32:30.119 --> 32:31.273
Could you make sure
he gets this?

32:31.308 --> 32:33.678
Oh, of course.

32:34.326 --> 32:37.091
- Thanks for the-the sauce.
- The sauce, yes.

32:37.126 --> 32:39.626
Well, what do you do
when you're not working?

32:39.661 --> 32:41.070
I don't know.

32:41.105 --> 32:42.661
- Thank you.
- There you go.

32:42.696 --> 32:44.141
Thank you.

32:44.176 --> 32:45.763
I'll just have one more.

32:46.415 --> 32:50.013
It never comes up.
I'm on call 24-7.

32:50.048 --> 32:51.398
That's terrible.

32:51.433 --> 32:55.925
I mean, you don't ever feel the need
to cut loose, do something crazy?

32:57.482 --> 32:59.404
Like what?

32:59.824 --> 33:01.650
Like dance...

33:01.685 --> 33:03.495
with me.

33:03.530 --> 33:06.155
Here. In the afternoon.

33:07.628 --> 33:10.525
- I'm a good dancer.
- I'll bet you are.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.427
Come on.

33:11.462 --> 33:12.584
Why not?

33:16.896 --> 33:18.979
I'm fine. I'm fine.

33:32.439 --> 33:34.321
I have an idea.

33:34.826 --> 33:36.691
What?

33:37.640 --> 33:42.480
Your apartment's
two blocks from here?

33:44.862 --> 33:47.869
We can't get in yet.
It's blocked off.

33:50.596 --> 33:53.083
You know what they say?

33:53.282 --> 33:56.066
Good things come
to those who wait.

33:58.260 --> 33:59.930
Well, I can't wait.

34:03.370 --> 34:05.214
We can just sneak in.

34:08.772 --> 34:13.724
- It's too dangerous.
- That's what makes it so exciting.

34:14.308 --> 34:16.678
Come on.

34:19.917 --> 34:21.967
Are you sure?

34:22.541 --> 34:24.400
I am sure.

34:27.553 --> 34:28.918
What?

34:29.433 --> 34:31.956
I just remembered.

34:31.992 --> 34:34.409
I promised Gail I'd be home by 2:30.

34:36.216 --> 34:38.221
We got plenty of time.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.422
Do you have any Q-tips?

34:41.875 --> 34:44.018
Well, Lieutenant
Disher dropped by.

34:44.054 --> 34:46.245
- He did?
- Yeah. You know, he's kinda cute.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.808
I've got this thing for cops.

34:47.842 --> 34:51.802
Yes, I know. That's why you
and I get along so swimmingly.

34:52.755 --> 34:53.956
Do you have any white ones?

34:53.992 --> 34:55.837
What's the difference?

34:55.958 --> 34:58.351
These are blue.

34:58.386 --> 34:59.797
I'll wait for Sharona.

34:59.832 --> 35:02.297
"Anywhozle,"
he dropped this off.

35:02.332 --> 35:04.790
Some phone records you wanted.

35:04.825 --> 35:07.643
And get this. They found
a body near Hobart Park.

35:07.678 --> 35:09.072
A gas company repairman.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.260
Lieutenant Disher said they think
he was killed near Sharona's house.

35:12.295 --> 35:15.934
What? - He said that it was probably no big
deal, but the captain wanted you to know.

35:17.253 --> 35:18.808
This is strange.

35:20.371 --> 35:23.952
Darryl, the phone lines are working.

35:24.073 --> 35:27.280
Really? - Yeah. I can finally
check my messages.

35:34.513 --> 35:39.455
There was a call from the Rutherford house
to Sharona's at 8:41 yesterday morning.

35:39.490 --> 35:41.426
That's just before
the earthquake hit.

35:41.461 --> 35:44.538
They were probably talking
about the fund-raiser.

35:44.573 --> 35:50.211
Then there was another call
to Sharona's again at 8:45 right...

35:50.351 --> 35:52.908
right after the quake that...

35:53.874 --> 35:56.964
She called Sharona's
before she called 911.

35:56.999 --> 35:58.768
Maybe she panicked.
Maybe she hit redial.

35:58.803 --> 36:01.897
Damn! Where are my keys?
They were in my bag.

36:02.078 --> 36:04.723
Your bag? It looks
just like Sharona's bag.

36:04.758 --> 36:06.066
So?

36:09.934 --> 36:11.489
He said, "Who's the widow?"

36:11.524 --> 36:12.721
- Who did?
- Darryl.

36:12.756 --> 36:17.556
When he saw Christine Rutherford
at the church he said, "Who's the widow?"

36:17.591 --> 36:19.202
How did he know
she was a widow?

36:19.237 --> 36:21.521
She could have been
mourning her father or a child.

36:21.556 --> 36:23.053
- Maybe he recognized her from TV.
- No.

36:23.088 --> 36:27.145
No, no. He said,
"Who's the widow?"

36:28.548 --> 36:30.211
He knows her.

36:32.684 --> 36:34.377
Oh, my God. Sharona.

36:35.316 --> 36:37.541
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

36:37.576 --> 36:39.528
It's Henry Rutherford.

36:40.138 --> 36:41.529
Listen.

36:42.419 --> 36:46.500
Sharona, this is Henry Rutherford.
I just spoke to the caterer and...

36:47.926 --> 36:49.578
Oh, my God.
It's an earthquake.!

36:52.878 --> 36:55.294
Christine, what are you...
No, no!

36:56.342 --> 36:57.868
I gotta call Adrian.

36:58.780 --> 37:02.488
I think we're going to be going
by your apartment after all.

37:04.148 --> 37:05.375
Move.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.546
We're coming up
to her place now.

37:15.793 --> 37:20.634
I've been trying to get that idiotic
tape out of your machine for two days.

37:27.116 --> 37:29.393
Don't park here.
Go around the block.

37:31.390 --> 37:33.646
Captain Stottlemeyer, please.
It's Adrian Monk.

37:33.681 --> 37:35.381
Tell him it's very important...

37:44.473 --> 37:46.258
Are you okay?

37:46.575 --> 37:48.366
How about that?
Mother was right, an aftershock.

37:48.401 --> 37:49.393
Can you believe it?

37:49.428 --> 37:52.698
Lieutenant, either fix that pipe
or buy everybody an umbrella.

37:52.733 --> 37:54.182
Yes, sir.

37:55.349 --> 37:57.869
Can you take line two, sir?
It's Monk.

37:59.408 --> 38:00.572
It better be good.

38:03.916 --> 38:05.215
What?

38:07.885 --> 38:10.999
Wait. No, wait, Monk.
Slow down. Try it again.

38:27.978 --> 38:30.157
Hi, this is Sharona and Benjy.

38:42.171 --> 38:45.231
- Why don't you write it down?
- That's a great idea. Write it down.

38:45.462 --> 38:47.082
Well, he's writing it down.

38:47.117 --> 38:48.925
It says, uh,

38:51.783 --> 38:54.811
Look, tell Monk that I'm gonna
send a squad car, okay?

38:54.846 --> 38:56.757
Well, no. He's...
He's already gone.

38:56.792 --> 38:58.295
He's gone?
What do you mean, "He's gone"?

38:58.330 --> 39:00.400
Captain, I think Sharona's in trouble.

39:02.857 --> 39:04.214
Lieutenant?

39:04.667 --> 39:06.180
Get the car!

39:26.941 --> 39:28.893
I was trying to avoid all this.

39:29.929 --> 39:33.554
I was trying to get to the answering
machine before you heard that message.

39:33.717 --> 39:34.923
Darryl!

39:37.046 --> 39:39.800
Honey, what are you doing here?
I told you I'd take care of it.

39:39.835 --> 39:41.559
You heartless bitch.

39:41.594 --> 39:43.110
Open the bloody door.

39:46.568 --> 39:50.145
Hold on. Hold on. W-Wait.
What the hell is that? Korean?

39:51.695 --> 39:53.318
Chinese?

39:54.178 --> 39:55.377
Turn here?

39:55.586 --> 39:57.095
You want me to turn here?
Is that what you're saying?

39:57.130 --> 40:00.668
Do you want me to turn here?
Is that what you're saying?

40:02.148 --> 40:04.788
They come over here
and they take our welfare,

40:04.823 --> 40:07.157
And they take our food stamps,

40:07.192 --> 40:09.539
but they don't bother to
learn our damn language.

40:11.638 --> 40:13.067
Inside.

40:16.837 --> 40:18.647
Oh, my God.

40:19.689 --> 40:21.310
Where's the tape?

40:22.609 --> 40:23.685
Where's the tape?

40:23.720 --> 40:26.385
- It's digital!
- Take the whole thing.

40:28.982 --> 40:32.343
Now. What are we
gonna do with you?

40:32.472 --> 40:34.225
We've got no choice.

40:34.318 --> 40:37.539
Come on, Darryl. Do it!
I've come too far to stop now.

40:37.574 --> 40:39.116
- Here?
- Yeah, here. Why not?

40:39.151 --> 40:40.931
'Cause blood is
gonna go everywhere.

40:40.966 --> 40:43.890
Who is gonna see blood
in this mess? - Monk will.

40:43.925 --> 40:46.251
Monk notices everything.
He's a damn freak!

40:46.286 --> 40:48.118
Well, just take her
to the bathroom...

41:00.967 --> 41:02.708
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

41:06.550 --> 41:07.863
Keep the change!

41:09.198 --> 41:11.291
So you can talk.

41:12.135 --> 41:14.263
Bilingual sons of bitches.

41:21.331 --> 41:22.590
Where are you going?

41:36.724 --> 41:37.962
Oh, God!

41:52.895 --> 41:54.479
Son of a bitch!

41:54.514 --> 41:57.179
I'm surprised you can
talk with a broken jaw.

41:57.470 --> 41:59.975
- I don't have a broken jaw.
- Not yet!

42:03.507 --> 42:05.189
Adrian!

42:06.123 --> 42:07.748
Adrian, are you okay?

42:08.022 --> 42:10.641
Oh, God. It's all over.

42:10.676 --> 42:12.876
- I'm gonna need a broom.
- Okay.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.014
Oh, my God!
It looks great!

42:24.049 --> 42:25.229
It's back to normal.

42:25.264 --> 42:28.129
I had a cleaning crew
take care of it.

42:28.164 --> 42:30.536
The insurance company
paid for most of it.

42:31.330 --> 42:34.512
I almost forgot.

42:35.540 --> 42:39.823
Here's the note you wrote.
Now do you believe me?

42:43.379 --> 42:45.450
Did I really write this?

42:45.770 --> 42:47.596
Unbelievable.

42:47.711 --> 42:49.616
Uh, Adrian, listen.

42:49.651 --> 42:52.678
Now that you're home,
there's something we have to talk about.

42:55.486 --> 42:58.363
I haven't been paid
since the earthquake.

42:58.605 --> 43:01.700
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. It's been three weeks.

43:04.893 --> 43:06.592
Here's your checkbook.

43:11.026 --> 43:12.284
That's not funny.

43:16.692 --> 43:18.732
Okay, will ya stop it?
You owe me money.

43:22.952 --> 43:24.194
I know you're faking it.

43:24.229 --> 43:26.575
- I'm not faking it!
- You just spoke English!
