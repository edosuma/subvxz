A. On the street.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.120

01:24.459 --> 01:27.719
Look at the paper and mark number four in your test book.

01:37.060 --> 01:40.730
- Nice. So you'll treat us, right? - Of course, sure thing.

01:40.939 --> 01:42.769
Give me your number so we can meet up later.

01:43.819 --> 01:45.988
- I'll give them my number. - Sure. We'll be off, then.

01:45.989 --> 01:47.568
- Okay, see you later. - See you.

01:47.569 --> 01:48.609
- Bye. - Bye.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.620
- They're cute. - Aren't they good-looking?

01:52.620 --> 01:54.659
Hyun Soo, look.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.329
Nice, right? I booked a pool villa.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.329
We're going to split the cost though.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.169
Why today, not tomorrow?

02:02.170 --> 02:04.209
It just happened that way.

02:04.420 --> 02:05.590
Why? You can't come?

02:06.969 --> 02:08.429
I have to do a group assignment later.

02:08.430 --> 02:09.758
Loser.

02:09.759 --> 02:12.969
I even found girls so we'd each have a date. An assignment, seriously?

02:13.430 --> 02:15.849
Anyway, I trust that you'll be there.

02:16.180 --> 02:17.349
Let's go. Come on.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.030
Mom, this stew is so good.

02:28.819 --> 02:31.110
- You should open a restaurant. - Should I?

02:31.620 --> 02:32.909
I'm home.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.830
- Join us for dinner. - Okay.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.080
Dad, are you done for the day?

02:39.250 --> 02:41.539
I'm staying in tonight. I think I'm coming down with something.

02:42.289 --> 02:43.960
You don't feel well, and you're drinking soju?

02:44.419 --> 02:45.668
Why? Do you want some?

02:45.669 --> 02:47.550
I have to go out again for a group assignment.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.309
I'm done. This was so good.

03:24.669 --> 03:26.839
Hey, where are you guys? Can I come now?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.460
- Hurry! - We're already here.

03:28.669 --> 03:31.879
Hurry up and join us. All the girls here are so hot.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.300
My, they're all drop-dead gorgeous.

03:34.759 --> 03:35.929
Really?

03:35.930 --> 03:38.139
Just take a cab here.

03:38.310 --> 03:39.849
It'll only cost about 100 dollars.

03:40.229 --> 03:41.729
I don't have 100 dollars right now.

03:43.979 --> 03:46.689
Tell your mom you need money to buy some books for school, you twerp.

03:46.939 --> 03:48.020
Hold on.

03:57.909 --> 03:59.120
Your dad drank too much.

04:00.789 --> 04:02.210
He should've stopped after the first glass.

04:06.539 --> 04:09.299
Hey, text me the address.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.919
Okay, sounds good.

04:25.310 --> 04:26.899
Don't stay out too late.

04:27.019 --> 04:28.060
Okay.

04:30.610 --> 04:31.689
I'll see you later.

What?

05:53.399 --> 05:55.149
You are going off-course.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.240
Darn it.

06:03.579 --> 06:05.000
Gosh.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.759

(Vacant)

06:31.350 --> 06:35.569
I'm sorry. This taxi is not available.

06:37.740 --> 06:39.240
I see. You're rejecting a customer.

06:41.319 --> 06:43.199
Where can I report this?

06:44.579 --> 06:48.709
No, it's not that. This taxi really is off duty.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.470
This taxi really is off duty right now.

07:25.910 --> 07:27.490
I'm sorry,

07:28.250 --> 07:31.829
but you can't smoke inside.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.089

Where to?

09:09.889 --> 09:11.220

09:12.470 --> 09:13.730
It's not far from here.

09:21.940 --> 09:23.240
Here you go.

09:32.870 --> 09:33.870
Run.

09:34.370 --> 09:36.330
- What? - Run!

09:38.879 --> 09:40.340
What the... Hey!

12:10.610 --> 12:11.950
It looks fine to me.

12:12.529 --> 12:14.070
I guess so, but...

12:16.620 --> 12:17.620
What's the problem?

12:19.240 --> 12:22.620
I'm sorry. I seem to have scratched your car.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.879
(35 R 3108)

12:29.500 --> 12:32.259
Well, it doesn't seem bad.

12:36.429 --> 12:37.509
Wait, are you drunk?

12:38.559 --> 12:39.559
No.

12:44.519 --> 12:45.690
Then be on your way.

12:47.190 --> 12:49.230
- But... - Just go.

12:49.730 --> 12:50.940
I said it's fine.

12:52.649 --> 12:54.909
We should go. He said it's all right.

13:18.509 --> 13:19.509
Wait.

13:20.470 --> 13:22.929
Do you live alone in this big house?

13:23.389 --> 13:24.389
I put my studies on hold...

13:24.390 --> 13:25.479
and came back to Korea three years ago...

13:25.480 --> 13:26.850
to take care of my sick mom.

13:28.559 --> 13:30.149
After she passed away...

13:31.570 --> 13:32.860
Well, you get the story.

13:34.070 --> 13:35.070
Right.

13:36.279 --> 13:39.369
Sorry about that. I shouldn't have asked.

13:39.370 --> 13:40.740
Why would you be sorry?

13:44.659 --> 13:46.288
The house is big enough,

13:46.289 --> 13:48.500
so I let a friend stay with me.

13:51.340 --> 13:53.710
But I had her leave after a big falling-out last week.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.590
So tonight, it's just you...

14:02.679 --> 14:03.809
and me.

14:49.980 --> 14:52.149
This is from my secret stash.

14:54.070 --> 14:55.149
Just for you.

15:16.710 --> 15:17.710
Gosh.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.470
What was that?

15:25.600 --> 15:26.600
Give it a try.

15:31.309 --> 15:33.559
Why would one do this?

16:12.059 --> 16:13.519
Oh, no. My gosh!

16:13.809 --> 16:17.440
Goodness. I'm terribly sorry.

19:34.849 --> 19:36.140
Doesn't your head hurt?

19:46.730 --> 19:50.650
Hey, I should go home now.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.200
It's really late.

20:09.089 --> 20:10.170
Well...

20:12.630 --> 20:13.640

20:22.599 --> 20:23.599
I'll be off, then.

20:26.940 --> 20:28.359
Hey.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.250
Drive safely.

23:29.869 --> 23:31.368
(DUI Checkpoint)

23:31.369 --> 23:33.920
Let's wrap up here and get going.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.150
Could you roll down your window, please?

24:00.700 --> 24:03.619
Sir, your gaze seems unsteady.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.660
Have you been drinking?

24:08.500 --> 24:10.829
No, I didn't drink.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.749
(Privately Owned Taxi, Kim Jung Jae)

24:17.750 --> 24:19.009
Please get out for a moment.

24:19.089 --> 24:22.680
(DUI Checkpoint)

24:23.130 --> 24:24.970
I'll have to measure your blood alcohol level.

24:25.759 --> 24:27.009
Blow on this, please.

24:29.849 --> 24:31.139
I don't want to.

24:31.140 --> 24:33.399
We'll have to do a blood test if you refuse a breath test,

24:33.400 --> 24:35.309
and it usually works to the drivers' disadvantage.

24:48.289 --> 24:49.700
The battery is dead.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.329
Do we have a spare one?

24:51.660 --> 24:52.789
No, we don't.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.618
Patrol 21, where are you now?

24:54.619 --> 24:57.089
We just received a report for a break-in in the area.

24:58.210 --> 24:59.298
You'd like us to go there?

24:59.299 --> 25:01.048
Everyone else is responding to other calls,

25:01.049 --> 25:02.470
so I need you to take care of this one.

25:02.839 --> 25:04.470
You're in the area, so head over there now.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.809
He wants us to head over there now. Can't we just let that guy go?

25:16.019 --> 25:17.689
Here's the address.

25:17.690 --> 25:21.779
Joongang-Gu 68, Choosa-ro.

25:22.359 --> 25:23.529
Is 21 on your way? Over.

25:23.859 --> 25:25.818
This is Patrol 24.

25:25.819 --> 25:28.200
We'll be on standby in case they need backup, over.

25:28.579 --> 25:30.490
Patrol 23 will...

25:31.950 --> 25:32.950
Move the car.

25:35.119 --> 25:36.420
We have to move the car.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.750
Sir, you'll have to come with us.

25:46.220 --> 25:48.799
Patrol 21, are you on your way to Joongang-dong for the break-in case?

25:49.180 --> 25:51.680
Yes, sir. We're on our way. We'll arrive in five minutes.

25:51.930 --> 25:54.849
Roger that. Joongang-dong...

25:57.059 --> 25:58.309
Roger that.

25:59.730 --> 26:01.019
Got the address.

26:03.109 --> 26:04.528
We'll be on our way too.

26:04.529 --> 26:06.319
Leaving in two minutes.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.509
It's just around the corner.

26:30.599 --> 26:31.759
Okay.

26:32.470 --> 26:33.890
He must be the one who called it in.

26:47.569 --> 26:49.450
It's that house over there.

26:50.119 --> 26:53.369
I saw a man run in and dash off.

26:54.910 --> 26:56.160
Did you see his face?

26:57.369 --> 26:59.079
Well, I did.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.589
But my eyesight is bad.

27:02.380 --> 27:03.500
I did see him...

27:04.299 --> 27:05.960
leaving in a taxi.

27:07.130 --> 27:09.680
In a taxi?

27:20.150 --> 27:22.309
- Someone reported a break-in? - Yes, sir.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.240
Thank you.

28:22.210 --> 28:23.210
Just a second.

28:23.289 --> 28:24.289
Hold on.

28:54.869 --> 28:56.779
You're at a crime scene. Remember that.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.118
I'm sorry, sir.

28:59.119 --> 29:00.410
Chief Park.

29:00.910 --> 29:02.000
What happened?

29:02.160 --> 29:05.079
A woman in her 20s has been stabbed.

29:06.170 --> 29:08.920
The gentleman over there reported a breaking and entering.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.508
He spotted a young man entering the house...

29:11.509 --> 29:12.588
and then fleeing in a taxi.

29:12.589 --> 29:14.220
He found it suspicious enough to call the police.

29:17.099 --> 29:18.099
Who's that in there?

29:19.509 --> 29:21.559
Oh, him. He's my arrest.

29:21.930 --> 29:23.308
It seemed like drunk driving.

29:23.309 --> 29:24.309
"Seemed like"?

29:25.309 --> 29:26.940
The battery ran out on my breathalyser.

29:27.519 --> 29:29.150
- I apologize. - We're sorry, sir.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.819
Where's your head at?

29:32.279 --> 29:33.399
(Police)

29:33.400 --> 29:35.029
Take him to the station then.

29:36.029 --> 29:37.528
Who entered the site?

29:37.529 --> 29:39.279
Oh, right. Well, these two and...

29:40.619 --> 29:41.700
Please exit the vehicle.

29:47.789 --> 29:50.089
I see you're sweating. Do you feel hot?

29:50.589 --> 29:51.589
No.

29:52.009 --> 29:53.880
You'll be taken to the station for now.

29:59.849 --> 30:02.680
Right. Keep up the good work then.

30:03.730 --> 30:04.730
Please get in.

30:05.099 --> 30:06.730
Watch your head.

30:07.230 --> 30:08.230
That's it.

30:09.019 --> 30:10.019
Good.

30:10.569 --> 30:11.569
Off you go.

30:11.819 --> 30:12.819
Good night, sir.

30:13.109 --> 30:14.569
The victim...

30:29.880 --> 30:32.169
The call came in at 4am.

30:32.170 --> 30:33.170
It was 4am, right?

30:34.380 --> 30:36.970
The victim was 25 years of age.

30:38.180 --> 30:39.180
Hold on a second.

30:40.759 --> 30:41.970
How many times was she stabbed?

30:42.309 --> 30:45.480
I'm not sure. Probably 12 or 13.

30:46.559 --> 30:47.559
Is that your lottery ticket?

30:50.150 --> 30:51.150
Thirteen it is.

30:51.690 --> 30:54.990
I have a good feeling about these numbers.

30:59.109 --> 31:00.119
Is...

31:01.779 --> 31:02.910
the woman...

31:04.039 --> 31:05.199
dead?

31:05.200 --> 31:06.829
Yes, probably.

31:07.660 --> 31:09.000
Are you a witness?

31:12.839 --> 31:13.839
No.

31:25.849 --> 31:26.849
All right.

31:27.019 --> 31:30.058
Just get going, will you?

31:30.059 --> 31:32.230
But it wasn't on purpose.

31:32.809 --> 31:34.479
It's not like I did anything wrong.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.819
- No, don't. - I got him.

31:37.319 --> 31:38.528
- Good evening. - Who do you have?

31:38.529 --> 31:40.278
Chief Park Sang Bum sent him over.

31:40.279 --> 31:41.990
- What for? - We don't know.

31:42.660 --> 31:43.778
Put him on the couch then.

31:43.779 --> 31:45.450
Sure thing. This way, please.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.119
(Fairness and Kindness)

31:51.369 --> 31:53.629
Take a seat here until the chief arrives.

31:53.630 --> 31:56.459
(Chungang Police Station)

31:56.460 --> 31:57.959
Good night, sir.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.258
Keep up the good work.

31:59.259 --> 32:00.259
Sure thing.

32:06.519 --> 32:07.640
You've reached the police station.

32:08.180 --> 32:10.019
Right. Sure thing.

32:11.269 --> 32:12.848
Of course. We'll keep that in mind.

32:12.849 --> 32:18.109
(Chungang Police Station)

32:38.259 --> 32:40.338
The murder weapon isn't serrated.

32:40.339 --> 32:43.130
It's a small knife that's about 15cm.

32:43.509 --> 32:45.390
The specs are too common to give you a model.

32:45.549 --> 32:46.559
And prints?

32:47.220 --> 32:49.058
I have a few good ones,

32:49.059 --> 32:50.599
but they probably belong to the victim.

32:51.059 --> 32:52.439
Most killers wipe down surfaces...

32:52.440 --> 32:54.190
or wear gloves to begin with.

32:55.650 --> 32:57.690
So you don't think it was accidental?

32:58.609 --> 33:01.318
Accidental killings aren't usually this gruesome.

33:01.319 --> 33:02.399
(Police)

33:02.400 --> 33:03.819
Unless it's a psycho, I mean.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.160
What is it?

33:07.529 --> 33:09.038
The team went out for drinks last night.

33:09.039 --> 33:11.410
Darn. It's bad luck to take a dump at the scene of a homicide.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.420
Hey, who has toilet paper?

33:27.180 --> 33:30.930
(Mom, My Dad)

33:34.309 --> 33:36.190
- Right. - All right.

33:38.940 --> 33:41.278
Spitting at a police station?

33:41.279 --> 33:44.199
- Unbelievable. - Why can I never get used to...

33:44.200 --> 33:45.990
the smell of a police station?

33:46.410 --> 33:48.329
It's been a while, guys.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.369
Make way, will you?

33:53.000 --> 33:54.579
- You psycho. - Is that so?

33:55.539 --> 33:57.630
What do you think you're looking at, you punk?

33:58.670 --> 34:00.299
- Detective Lee. - Hey, you.

34:00.710 --> 34:02.009
Don't you know who I am?

34:02.710 --> 34:04.089
- You piece of scum. - What?

34:04.509 --> 34:06.299
What was that you just blabbered?

34:07.009 --> 34:09.510
Keep it down, will you? This isn't a fight club.

34:16.139 --> 34:18.689
Say that again. What did you just say to me?

34:18.690 --> 34:20.400
- What a sap. - A sap?

34:21.150 --> 34:23.030
You must be out of your mind.

34:23.650 --> 34:25.949
What are you looking at me for?

34:26.360 --> 34:28.409
Why? Does it make you nervous?

34:30.449 --> 34:32.289
Hey, hey!

34:36.960 --> 34:39.130
Is the dead girl the owner of this house?

34:39.500 --> 34:41.288
The guy did seem a bit weird.

34:41.289 --> 34:42.750
He must've did a number on her.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.170
This is why you can't trust the handsome type.

34:51.050 --> 34:52.139
Excuse me, sir.

34:54.849 --> 34:55.849
(Detective)

34:55.850 --> 34:57.519
- Me? - That's right.

34:59.599 --> 35:00.980
It seems like you saw something.

35:01.900 --> 35:02.900
Me?

35:04.150 --> 35:05.440
It's actually nothing.

35:07.150 --> 35:09.819
- Repeat what you just heard. - Sorry?

35:09.820 --> 35:11.909
Repeat what you just heard...

35:12.199 --> 35:13.449
word for word.

35:13.739 --> 35:16.869
Oh, right. Well...

35:17.960 --> 35:20.578
"The guy did seem a bit weird."

35:20.579 --> 35:22.210
"He must've did a number on her."

35:23.340 --> 35:25.259
Gosh. I apologize for that.

35:25.260 --> 35:26.840
It's fine. Keep going.

35:28.630 --> 35:31.428
"This is why you can't trust the handsome type."

35:31.429 --> 35:33.179

Darn it.

35:37.230 --> 35:39.638
(Protection, Fairness, and Kindness)

35:39.639 --> 35:42.110
Darn. Stop that, will you?

35:43.400 --> 35:44.900
Unbelievable.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.359
You've reached Chungang Police Station.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.650
How may I help you?

35:49.650 --> 35:50.659
Yes.

36:01.170 --> 36:03.210
(Information and Reception)

36:18.599 --> 36:20.730
Detective Lee, who's he?

36:21.019 --> 36:22.849
A witness to a murder case.

36:23.400 --> 36:24.610
A murder case?

36:25.110 --> 36:26.359
Who took center stage?

36:26.360 --> 36:28.110
Crazy jerk.

36:28.530 --> 36:30.400
Sir, I'll be with you in a second.

(My Dad)

38:02.949 --> 38:05.710
(Chungang Police Station)

38:18.090 --> 38:20.389
Good work, Chief.

38:20.929 --> 38:22.968
You look tired, Chief.

38:22.969 --> 38:24.518
Who's the culprit? The son of a gun.

38:24.519 --> 38:27.099
My gosh, brother. Shouldn't you be retiring soon?

38:27.230 --> 38:29.189
What are you doing here, jerk?

38:29.190 --> 38:32.820
And I'm not your brother, you little twerp.

38:32.940 --> 38:35.320
Hey, eyes down.

38:42.489 --> 38:43.909
What's this guy doing here?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.329
I thought you sent him here, sir.

38:46.619 --> 38:48.459
Since when did we do a sobriety test here?

38:48.460 --> 38:50.669
A sobriety test? What are you talking about?

38:50.670 --> 38:52.460
Do your job better, will you?

38:52.960 --> 38:54.969
- I'm sorry, sir. - We apologize, sir.

39:02.349 --> 39:04.559
He has weird eyes.

39:05.889 --> 39:07.230
- Hey. - Yes, sir.

39:09.809 --> 39:11.440
See if he has any drugs on him.

39:11.769 --> 39:12.820
Yes, sir.

39:17.820 --> 39:20.320
Sir, we have to search you.

39:26.409 --> 39:29.419
By the way, I heard the victim was stabbed 13 times.

39:29.420 --> 39:30.499
Yes.

39:30.500 --> 39:33.129
We're estimating that it took place at around 2 to 3am.

39:33.130 --> 39:34.339
The suspect is a man in his 20s.

39:34.340 --> 39:37.259
He ran out of the house and fled in a taxi. That's all we know...

39:37.260 --> 39:40.718
Hey, he didn't have to hail a taxi.

39:40.719 --> 39:42.639
He just got in the taxi and left.

39:43.719 --> 39:44.848
What's the difference?

39:44.849 --> 39:48.190
You're awfully slow-witted. How did you even become a cop?

39:49.139 --> 39:52.809
That punk drove off in his taxi.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.949
A man in his 20s...

40:03.070 --> 40:05.369
drove off in his taxi?

40:08.710 --> 40:10.579
Put your hands behind your head.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.170
You said the victim was stabbed.

40:15.460 --> 40:18.800
Yes. The blade length is about 15cm, and the width is about 3cm.

40:30.769 --> 40:32.269
- Officer Park. - What's that?

40:34.519 --> 40:36.268
I... I didn't do it.

40:36.269 --> 40:37.610
Don't move.

40:43.570 --> 40:44.829
What is your name?

40:46.449 --> 40:48.039
Kim Hyun Soo.

40:49.659 --> 40:51.249
I...

40:51.250 --> 40:52.250
It wasn't me.

40:52.251 --> 40:53.788
Where did you see him? What time?

40:53.789 --> 40:56.420
A five-minute drive from the scene. He was driving a taxi.

40:56.550 --> 41:00.129
We were wrapping up, so I'd say it was around 4am.

41:00.130 --> 41:01.719
At 4:13am, sir.

41:02.340 --> 41:03.718
Where is the taxi now?

41:03.719 --> 41:05.099
We just left it there.

41:05.679 --> 41:07.389
It would've been dangerous for him to drive.

41:07.429 --> 41:09.138
What are you waiting for, Detective Park?

41:09.139 --> 41:10.848
Recite the Miranda Rights.

41:10.849 --> 41:13.598
Kim Hyun Soo, you are under arrest for murder.

41:13.599 --> 41:14.689
You have the right against self-incrimination...

41:14.690 --> 41:15.768
and will be given a chance to explain yourself.

41:15.769 --> 41:16.859
You have the right to an attorney...

41:16.860 --> 41:19.229
and may request the court to review the legality of the arrest.

41:19.230 --> 41:20.360
I didn't do it.

41:22.030 --> 41:23.159
It wasn't me.

41:24.320 --> 41:25.449
It wasn't me.

41:26.449 --> 41:28.579
I didn't do it.

41:28.829 --> 41:30.289
It wasn't me.

41:30.829 --> 41:32.789
It really wasn't me.

41:34.880 --> 41:37.089
I didn't do it!

41:37.090 --> 41:38.210
Be quiet!

41:41.510 --> 41:42.590
Don't move!

41:43.300 --> 41:45.260
Stay still. Darn it!

41:45.340 --> 41:47.349
- It wasn't me... - Hey! Stay still!

41:47.969 --> 41:49.510
Relax your arms!

41:49.679 --> 41:51.849
Stay still! Don't move.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.559
You cops are amazing. Way to go!

41:55.900 --> 41:58.190
Stay still! Don't move.

42:01.489 --> 42:05.280
It wasn't... It really wasn't me.

42:07.030 --> 42:08.119
There, it's on.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.449
- Hey, relax! - Relax.

42:14.710 --> 42:18.000
(My Dad)

42:19.420 --> 42:22.210
The person you have reached is unavailable. Please leave...

42:26.510 --> 42:29.759
Mom, just file a police report.

42:29.760 --> 42:31.428
If you let him off, he'll do it again.

42:31.429 --> 42:33.928
Hey, we have no idea what happened to your brother.

42:33.929 --> 42:35.690
File a police report? For what?

42:36.099 --> 42:38.269
Ji Soo, can you try calling him?

42:38.809 --> 42:41.190
Gosh, I have to go to school.

42:43.110 --> 42:47.780
(Crazy Sister)

42:48.949 --> 42:52.949
(Video Recording Consent Form)

42:55.539 --> 42:57.960
I woke up...

42:59.960 --> 43:01.879
and thought I should head home.

43:01.880 --> 43:02.960
And?

43:03.170 --> 43:06.420
So I went to her room to say goodbye to her...

43:10.719 --> 43:12.098
and found her like that.

43:12.099 --> 43:13.389
She was dead.

43:13.809 --> 43:15.179
Then what did you do?

43:21.269 --> 43:23.780
I ran away because I was scared.

43:24.110 --> 43:26.650
I didn't... I really didn't do it.

43:34.119 --> 43:35.159
Hyun Soo.

43:37.829 --> 43:41.420
You are the last person who saw Hong Guk Hwa alive,

43:43.130 --> 43:46.300
and you were also the first person to find her dead.

43:48.380 --> 43:50.429
Do you know what we usually call people like that?

43:51.179 --> 43:52.550
"Suspect."

43:56.389 --> 43:57.809
I'm sure you know what this room is for.

43:58.099 --> 44:00.309
You must've seen it in movies or TV shows.

44:01.860 --> 44:03.400
This is being recorded,

44:04.519 --> 44:06.780
and it is admissible in court as evidence.

44:10.239 --> 44:11.909
But you see,

44:12.989 --> 44:15.989
the judges won't like this...

44:16.909 --> 44:18.659
because they don't like liars.

44:19.960 --> 44:21.000
I...

44:21.829 --> 44:23.500
I really didn't do it.

44:24.289 --> 44:26.090
I can't say I did it...

44:26.510 --> 44:28.219
when I didn't do it.

44:29.050 --> 44:31.010
Then why did she die?

44:31.639 --> 44:34.389
I don't know. I don't remember anything.

44:34.639 --> 44:37.099
I woke up...

44:38.309 --> 44:41.980
and found her like that.

44:46.650 --> 44:47.860
Hyun Soo.

44:50.320 --> 44:53.320
Claiming that you remember nothing is not a good strategy either.

44:55.369 --> 44:58.159
Judges hate liars the most.

44:59.789 --> 45:01.710
The second thing they hate...

45:02.789 --> 45:05.130
is dealing with people who say they don't remember anything.

45:55.469 --> 45:57.050
Spray this on him.

46:07.150 --> 46:08.150
Turn off the lights.

46:35.300 --> 46:36.300

We're here too.

47:14.090 --> 47:16.050
What's up with him this morning?

47:20.050 --> 47:21.599
Good to see you.

Hello, I'm Lawyer Shin Joong Han.

47:28.690 --> 47:30.610
Yes, please have a seat.

47:31.519 --> 47:33.280
It's been a rough night, hasn't it?

47:34.230 --> 47:37.739
Let me see what you're up against.

47:43.369 --> 47:44.739
I...

47:45.329 --> 47:47.659
I would like a lawyer as well.

47:48.420 --> 47:49.578
But you said you're innocent.

47:49.579 --> 47:51.539
Why would you need a lawyer when you didn't do it?

47:55.380 --> 47:57.009
- Have a good one. - Let's get going.

47:57.010 --> 47:58.429
- Sure thing. - All right.

48:25.369 --> 48:27.579
Darn, that stinks.

48:28.210 --> 48:30.750
Hey, I think you've dumped enough in there.

48:31.329 --> 48:34.590
What does one have to eat to stink like that?

48:35.050 --> 48:37.510
Talk about having a lousy morning.

48:38.550 --> 48:41.049
One should wash their hands after taking a dump,

48:41.050 --> 48:43.049
you disgusting moron.

48:43.050 --> 48:44.050
Of course.

48:48.429 --> 48:50.348
I saw a kid in the holding cell.

48:50.349 --> 48:51.559
One that looks like he's in a boy band.

48:51.980 --> 48:55.190
Oh, him? He was arrested for rape and murder.

48:55.730 --> 48:57.899
Rape and murder? With a face like that?

48:57.900 --> 48:59.988
What do looks have to do with it?

48:59.989 --> 49:02.530
He was drunk driving and was probably high on drugs.

49:03.199 --> 49:04.409
The worst combination.

49:05.239 --> 49:06.618
Why? Does he intrigue you?

49:06.619 --> 49:08.659
As if.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.919
Yes, it'll be 300 dollars and I take credit cards...

49:17.920 --> 49:19.260
with no additional interest for three months.

49:19.800 --> 49:20.800
That's right.

49:21.719 --> 49:24.469
Is that so? That's too bad then.

49:25.050 --> 49:27.309
You should know though...

49:28.010 --> 49:30.179
that no one charges less than I do.

49:31.139 --> 49:32.519
Yes, please give me a call.

49:33.019 --> 49:34.769
Pricey, my foot.

49:35.900 --> 49:40.489
(For the People, With the People, Trustworthy Chungang Police)

49:53.460 --> 49:55.170
I guess a poke won't hurt.

50:31.199 --> 50:32.449
Did you get yourself a lawyer?

50:35.329 --> 50:36.329
What?

50:38.130 --> 50:39.130
You see,

50:40.300 --> 50:43.339
I didn't do this.

50:43.340 --> 50:45.678
All I did was have drinks with her and...

50:45.679 --> 50:47.550
No, stop that.

50:50.929 --> 50:53.230
From here on out, keep this in mind.

50:54.429 --> 50:57.269
You are not to talk with anyone else.

50:57.980 --> 51:00.609
If someone asks your opinion on Korean reunification,

51:00.610 --> 51:02.230
you will say you don't know.

51:02.440 --> 51:04.570
If someone asks who created Hangul,

51:05.030 --> 51:06.699
you will say you don't know.

51:07.989 --> 51:10.280
To any question, you will only say,

51:10.329 --> 51:11.539
"I don't know."

51:13.079 --> 51:14.699
"Talk to my lawyer."

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Understand?

51:20.880 --> 51:23.129
But it really wasn't me.

51:23.130 --> 51:25.090
What did I just tell you?

51:27.130 --> 51:28.130
Right.

51:32.349 --> 51:34.389
I bet you have no idea what's going on.

51:35.179 --> 51:36.179
Am I right?

51:40.809 --> 51:43.610
By the way, what's your name?

51:45.820 --> 51:48.030
It's Kim Hyun Soo.

51:48.659 --> 51:49.659
Hyun Soo?

51:50.570 --> 51:52.119
"Hyun" as in generous and "Soo" as in outstanding?

51:52.909 --> 51:54.159
- Yes. - I see.

51:54.699 --> 51:55.789
I like that name.

51:56.079 --> 51:57.409
It has energy to it.

51:59.170 --> 52:00.170
I'm...

52:01.000 --> 52:02.500
Lawyer Shin Joong Han.

52:03.380 --> 52:04.380
Shin Joong Han.

52:07.340 --> 52:08.340
Here.

52:09.469 --> 52:10.550
I hope...

52:11.550 --> 52:12.550
we get along.

52:17.679 --> 52:18.690
Sure.
