00:22.000 --> 00:25.933
I SEE A GLASS OF WATER
SPILLING.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.000
THANK YOU.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.400
WOULD'VE BEEN NICE
IF IT WERE

00:34.400 --> 00:37.500
SOMEONE ELSE'S GLASS.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.267
- THAT WAS AMAZING.

00:39.267 --> 00:42.100
- WHAT'S AMAZING IS NO ONE'S
TIPPED ME YET.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.233
CLEARLY LABELED JAR HERE,
PEOPLE.

00:46.233 --> 00:49.267
PERHAPS THAT WILL CHANGE
WHEN YOU SEE ME BEND

00:49.267 --> 00:53.433
AN ORDINARY SPOON
USING ONLY MY MIND.

00:53.433 --> 00:56.000
all: OOH.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.900
ANY TIME NOW.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.633
BENDING THE SPOON.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.700
OH, WHAT'S THIS THING
MADE OF?

01:05.700 --> 01:08.833
- THIS IS JUST SAD.

01:16.167 --> 01:17.900
- LOOK AT MY BOY OUT THERE.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.633

01:19.633 --> 01:22.400
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.900
- IS MILES FLIRTING
WITH THAT LAMPPOST?

01:25.900 --> 01:28.300
- NO, HE'S TALKING
TO A GHOST GIRL.

01:28.300 --> 01:31.067
- OH. WELL, HOW COME
I CAN SEE MILES AND NOT HER?

01:31.067 --> 01:32.767
- BECAUSE MILES LIVES HERE.

01:32.767 --> 01:34.300
YOU CAN ONLY SEE OUTSIDE GHOSTS

01:34.300 --> 01:35.800
WHEN THEY COME INSIDE.
- HMM.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.600
- THIS HOUSE IS VERY SPECIAL.

01:41.233 --> 01:43.967
OOPS.

01:43.967 --> 01:45.067

01:45.067 --> 01:47.400
IT'S VERY SPECIAL.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.967
SO MILES HAS
A GHOST GIRL CRUSH.

01:49.967 --> 01:51.533
OH, HOW CUTE.

01:51.533 --> 01:52.933
- HMM, LOOK AT HIM.

01:52.933 --> 01:56.633
HE'D HAVE A BETTER SHOT
WITH THE LAMPPOST.

01:56.633 --> 01:57.667
- HE'S DOING FINE.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.067
UH-OH.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.467
I THINK HE'S DOING HIS
BOW TIE JOKES.

02:01.467 --> 02:03.833
- THE GREAT FRANKINI
PREDICTS...

02:03.833 --> 02:06.467
IT'S ABOUT TO GET WORSE.

02:06.467 --> 02:08.100
THERE IT IS.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.433
- AT LEAST HE'S
STILL CHATTING HER UP.

02:10.433 --> 02:12.200
- NO, SHE'S GONE.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.067
NOW HE'S JUST TALKING
TO THE LAMPPOST.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.133
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:21.133 --> 02:24.067
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:24.067 --> 02:26.100

WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:26.100 --> 02:30.067
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:30.067 --> 02:32.300
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:32.300 --> 02:33.933
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:33.933 --> 02:36.800
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:36.800 --> 02:39.667
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:39.667 --> 02:41.733
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:41.733 --> 02:45.500
*

02:45.500 --> 02:53.933

02:57.133 --> 03:01.200
YOU WILL BEND.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.467
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

03:02.467 --> 03:03.800

03:03.800 --> 03:06.233
SATURDAY IS CRAZY CAKES DAY.

03:06.233 --> 03:08.133
- ONCE A YEAR...

03:08.133 --> 03:09.400
TAYLOR AND I MAKE

03:09.400 --> 03:11.267
THE MOST DISGUSTING CAKES
POSSIBLE,

03:11.267 --> 03:12.967
THEN DARE EACH OTHER
TO EAT THEM.

03:14.900 --> 03:17.300
- SOMETIMES.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.133
IT'S THE ONE ACTIVITY
TAYLOR AND I

03:19.133 --> 03:20.467
STILL HAVE IN COMMON.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.067
I JUST GOT THIS FRAMED
FROM LAST YEAR.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.333
TAYLOR'S HOME!

03:29.067 --> 03:31.267

03:32.933 --> 03:35.967

03:38.833 --> 03:40.300
- YOUR SISTER JUST GOT

03:40.300 --> 03:43.833

IN PERSON!

03:48.067 --> 03:49.933

03:52.467 --> 03:53.833
- AAH!

03:53.833 --> 03:57.067
WHAT?
I LIKE TO PLAN.

03:57.067 --> 03:59.367
- I CAN'T WAIT FOR SATURDAY.

04:00.967 --> 04:03.233
BUT THAT'S CRAZY CAKES DAY.

04:03.233 --> 04:05.700
- FRANKIE, THIS FUNDRAISER
IS HUGE.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.100
AND I MEAN, COME ON.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.733
HAVEN'T WE KIND OF OUTGROWN
CRAZY CAKES DAY?

04:08.733 --> 04:11.933
- OH...RIGHT.

04:11.933 --> 04:14.100
IT'S REALLY DUMB.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.667
I ONLY BROUGHT IT UP
'CAUSE I THOUGHT

04:15.667 --> 04:18.967
YOU WERE STILL INTO IT.

04:20.233 --> 04:22.900
YEAH, UM...

04:22.900 --> 04:25.333

04:28.200 --> 04:30.933

04:35.933 --> 04:37.900

HOW YOU DOING?

04:37.900 --> 04:39.500
- I'VE BEEN BETTER.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.700
I HAVE A PERSONAL PROBLEM
I'M DEALING WITH.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.700
- I WONDER WHAT THAT COULD BE.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.067
IS IT PERHAPS...

04:45.067 --> 04:46.867
* MILES LIKES
A GIRL GHOST *

04:46.867 --> 04:49.067
* MILES LIKES A GIRL GHOST

04:52.933 --> 04:54.700
YOU'RE NOT READY
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.100
THAT'S COOL.

04:58.067 --> 05:00.267
- IT'S THIS GIRL WENDY.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.100
I THOUGHT THINGS WERE
GOING GREAT.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.233
I WAS WOOING HER
WITH MY "A" GAME.

05:05.233 --> 05:07.067
- SON, WE SAW YOU.

05:07.067 --> 05:11.167
YOU HAD A SOCK PUPPET.

05:11.167 --> 05:14.133
- LIKE I SAID, MY "A" GAME.

05:14.133 --> 05:15.900
- I LOVE YOU, SON.
BUT NO.

05:15.900 --> 05:19.133
NO, NO, NO.

05:19.133 --> 05:20.767
LUCKILY, YOU LIVE
WITH SOMEBODY

05:20.767 --> 05:23.133
WHO CAN TELL YOU EVERYTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WOMEN.

05:23.133 --> 05:25.733
HA!

05:25.733 --> 05:27.833
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

05:31.100 --> 05:34.800

05:43.067 --> 05:44.633

05:44.633 --> 05:47.467

05:47.467 --> 05:48.700
OBSERVE.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.100
HEY, TAY.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.767

05:56.533 --> 05:58.567
- WHY WOULDN'T SHE SEEK
YOUR FEEDBACK?

05:58.567 --> 06:01.200
YOU'RE SUCH
A HIP, HAPPENING WOMAN.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.633
- YOU'RE WISE, MILES.

06:03.633 --> 06:04.967

06:04.967 --> 06:07.800

OVER YOUR GHOST CRUSH.

06:07.800 --> 06:12.067
WELCOME TO MICHELLE

06:13.767 --> 06:15.333
BY THE WAY,
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

06:15.333 --> 06:16.367
YOU WERE ON A DATE?

06:16.367 --> 06:17.800
- THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS

06:17.800 --> 06:21.133
AT MICHELLE HATHAWAY'S ACADEMY
OF DATING.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.100
- WE HAVE ONE SISTER TRADITION,

06:25.100 --> 06:27.467
THEN TAYLOR CANCELS IT?

06:27.467 --> 06:31.933
I SPENT A FORTUNE
ON DISGUSTING FOODS.

06:33.733 --> 06:36.633
OR MAYBE YOU WORRY
TAYLOR'S ACTIONS SYMBOLIZE

06:36.633 --> 06:41.067
THE FACT YOU TWO ARE
EMOTIONALLY DRIFTING APART?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.233
- FRANKIE.

06:42.233 --> 06:43.467
THAT POP STAR,
SKYLER MAKEPEACE,

06:43.467 --> 06:45.067
IS COMING OVER TO TALK
TO TAYLOR

06:45.067 --> 06:46.200
ABOUT HER FUNDRAISER.

06:48.733 --> 06:50.600
- TAYLOR GOT HELD UP
AT PRACTICE,

06:50.600 --> 06:52.767
SO KEEP HIM COMPANY
TILL SHE GETS HERE.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.567
MILES IS ABOUT TO ASK

06:56.567 --> 06:58.300
HIS GHOST FRIEND OUT
ON A DATE.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.100
HE'S SO NERVOUS,
HE'S THREATENING TO BREAK

07:00.100 --> 07:01.500
OUT THE SOCK PUPPETS AGAIN.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.333
AS HIS ADVISOR,
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

07:04.333 --> 07:07.100
I CAN'T. I WON'T.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.433
- WAIT A SECOND.

07:12.433 --> 07:15.433
IF TAYLOR DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO THIS SATURDAY,

07:15.433 --> 07:17.933
IT WOULD FREE HER UP
FOR CRAZY CAKES DAY.

07:19.367 --> 07:21.567
- I MEAN SKYLER MAKEPEACE
MIGHT NOT WANT TO DO

07:21.567 --> 07:23.167
THE FUNDRAISER
AFTER A VISIT

07:23.167 --> 07:26.267
FROM THE GREAT FRANKINI...

07:26.267 --> 07:29.233
AND HER
TRUSTY ASSISTANT.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.533
I THOUGHT WE WERE PARTNERS.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.067
- LOUIE,
IF WE WERE PARTNERS,

07:34.067 --> 07:37.867
WOULDN'T WE BOTH HAVE CAPES?

07:42.267 --> 07:43.667
ANYBODY HERE?

07:43.667 --> 07:45.800

07:45.800 --> 07:48.300

07:51.533 --> 07:54.733
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I KNOW MANY THINGS.

07:54.733 --> 07:57.767
I AM THE GREAT FRANKINI.

07:57.767 --> 08:00.667
- OF COURSE YOU ARE IN
YOUR PRETTY LITTLE OUTFIT.

08:00.667 --> 08:03.400
- HEY, CHEEKBONES,

08:03.400 --> 08:04.933
I'M THE REAL DEAL.

08:04.933 --> 08:06.167
- I'M SURE YOU ARE.

08:06.167 --> 08:08.567
I'M JUST GONNA WAIT
OVER HERE.

08:08.567 --> 08:09.767
- FINE.

08:09.767 --> 08:12.067
GUESS YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR FUTURE.

08:12.067 --> 08:14.500
YOUR BLEAK, TROUBLED FUTURE

08:14.500 --> 08:16.267
WHERE YOU'LL SOON MEET
A BROWN-HAIRED GIRL

08:16.267 --> 08:17.667
WITH A PONYTAIL
WHO IS CURSED

08:17.667 --> 08:20.433
AND WILL BRING YOU NOTHING
BUT BAD LUCK.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.067
STAY AWAY FROM HER.

08:22.067 --> 08:26.500
YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

08:27.867 --> 08:31.067
OH, MY GOSH.
SKYLER MAKEPEACE.

08:31.067 --> 08:33.333
- AAH!

08:42.900 --> 08:45.333
- DO YOUR THING, BIG GUY.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.333
- I'M SO SORRY.

08:50.333 --> 08:51.433

08:51.433 --> 08:53.067

THAT WAS WEIRD.

08:53.067 --> 08:54.100

08:54.100 --> 08:56.433
- UGH!

08:56.433 --> 08:58.533

09:17.967 --> 09:19.200

09:20.700 --> 09:22.067
JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME,
PONYTAIL.

09:22.067 --> 09:23.467
YOU'RE CURSED!
FORGET THE FUNDRAISER!

09:23.467 --> 09:24.967
I'M OUT OF HERE.

09:28.733 --> 09:33.433
- LOOKS LIKE I JUST EARNED
MYSELF A CAPE.

09:33.433 --> 09:35.567
CLOSE ENOUGH.

09:39.433 --> 09:40.433
- COME ON.

09:40.433 --> 09:41.833
JUST LIKE I TAUGHT YOU.

09:41.833 --> 09:44.667
YOU DON'T NEED SOCK PUPPETS
TO CHARM A GIRL.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.667
- HEY.
HOW'S MILES DOING?

09:46.667 --> 09:47.600
- SHH.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.233
HE'S DRINKING IN MY WISDOM.

09:50.233 --> 09:52.067

09:52.067 --> 09:53.167
- NOT TO BRAG...

09:53.167 --> 09:56.500
BUT I AM AWESOME.

09:56.500 --> 10:00.633
- YOU DO KNOW WHAT "BRAG" MEANS,
RIGHT?

10:06.300 --> 10:07.367
- WELL, THE TRUTH IS...

10:07.367 --> 10:08.833
I GOT A DATE!

10:08.833 --> 10:11.200
- THAT'S MY BOY.
SON, I'M PROUD OF YOU.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.633
IT'S YOUR FIRST DATE.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.000
NOW LISTEN TO YOUR OLD MAN
WHEN I TELL YOU--

10:14.000 --> 10:15.767
- MICHELLE,

10:15.767 --> 10:17.267
- ALREADY PUT TOGETHER A LIST.

10:17.267 --> 10:18.300
GRAB YOUR BINDER,
MEET ME IN THE KITCHEN.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.567
THIS IS NOT A DRILL, PEOPLE!

10:20.567 --> 10:21.800
- THAT'S COOL.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.667
PLENTY OF OTHER KIDS
IN THIS HOUSE

10:23.667 --> 10:27.533
THAT CAN BENEFIT
FROM MY KNOWLEDGE.

10:27.533 --> 10:31.333
HEY, TAYLOR,
WHAT'S COOKING?

10:32.333 --> 10:33.867
YO, KIDS.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.700
HOW GOES IT?

10:36.700 --> 10:37.767
ALL RIGHT.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.433
I'LL JUST BE IN THE ATTIC,

10:39.433 --> 10:42.100
NOT TAKING ANY
OF THIS PERSONALLY.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.367
- GUYS, I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

10:44.367 --> 10:45.867
ALL THAT STUFF WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

10:45.867 --> 10:48.767
- YOU JUST LOST US
SKYLER MAKEPEACE.

10:48.767 --> 10:51.300
- AAH-OW!

10:51.300 --> 10:55.367
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT
ANYMORE?

10:55.367 --> 10:57.967
- WE HAVE A FUNDRAISER
STARTING IN THREE HOURS

10:57.967 --> 10:59.333
AND NO HEADLINER.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.100
- I CAN FIX THIS.

11:02.100 --> 11:05.067
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

11:10.767 --> 11:12.433
- I WAS UNTIL
I RUINED EVERYTHING

11:12.433 --> 11:15.567
AND LET MY FRIENDS DOWN.

11:17.067 --> 11:20.400
- WELL, AT LEAST YOU GET YOUR
CAKE DAY.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.967
- NO. I HAVE TO GET
SKYLER BACK.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.967
- I WANTED CRAZY CAKES DAY,

11:25.967 --> 11:27.100
BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.300
I'M SAVING
TAYLOR'S FUNDRAISER.

11:29.300 --> 11:33.300
- I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WOMEN.

11:36.933 --> 11:38.967
YOU WANT TO LEARN
ABOUT WOMEN, SON?

11:38.967 --> 11:40.067
- YES, I DO.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.900
- YES.

11:41.900 --> 11:48.767
- MICHELLE!

11:48.767 --> 11:50.567
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THE GUY
AT THE FRONT DESK

11:50.567 --> 11:52.233
GAVE YOU
SKYLER'S SUITE NUMBER.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.700
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HE BOUGHT
I WAS A FEDERAL AGENT.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.467
- THE FAKE BADGE
AND HANDCUFFS HELPED.

11:57.467 --> 12:02.100
- RIGHT...FAKE.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.767
OKAY,
LET'S GO CONVINCE SKYLER

12:03.767 --> 12:06.900
HE NEEDS TO DO
TAYLOR'S FUNDRAISER.

12:11.867 --> 12:14.900
- PLEASE, JUST CALL ME
"GREAT."

12:14.900 --> 12:16.833
MAY I?

12:19.300 --> 12:21.233
WHOA!

12:21.233 --> 12:23.967
THIS SUITE IS SAH-WEET!

12:23.967 --> 12:26.633
- SORRY, I DOUBTED YOU
ABOUT PONYTAIL GIRL.

12:26.633 --> 12:27.633
YOU WERE SO RIGHT.

12:27.633 --> 12:29.600
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT--

12:29.600 --> 12:32.867
STOP JUMPING, IDIOT...

12:32.867 --> 12:36.067
WOULD BE
A GREAT SONG TITLE.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.167
THINK ABOUT IT.

12:37.167 --> 12:39.833
ANYWAY, I CAME HERE TODAY
TO TELL YOU

12:39.833 --> 12:41.433
THAT I'M NOT A PSYCHIC.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.567
- BUT EVERYTHING
YOU SAID CAME TRUE.

12:43.567 --> 12:45.067
- IT WAS A JOKE.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.067
I WANTED TO STOP YOU

12:46.067 --> 12:47.733
FROM DOING TAYLOR'S FUNDRAISER.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.900
- WELL, IT WORKED.
I'M NOT GOING.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.100
- OKAY, V-NECK,
LISTEN UP.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.100
YOU'RE PERFORMING.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.667
I MESSED UP THINGS
FOR MY SISTER,

12:55.667 --> 12:57.167
AND I NEED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.967
- SORRY, BUT I GOT TO THE TOP
OF THE CHARTS

12:58.967 --> 13:01.200
BY TRUSTING MY GUT,
AND IT'S TELLING ME

13:01.200 --> 13:02.300
TO STAY AWAY.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.300
- BUT MY SISTER NEEDS YOU THERE.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.400
- LISTEN. NOT GOING.

13:05.400 --> 13:09.300
YOU CAN LET
YOURSELF OUT.

13:09.300 --> 13:14.233
- WHOA! WHOA!

13:14.233 --> 13:16.300
UH-OH, FRANKIE.

13:16.300 --> 13:19.567
I THINK I MADE A WHOOPSIE.

13:23.067 --> 13:25.733
- YEAH, SORRY.
I'LL GET OUT.

13:25.733 --> 13:27.300
- NO, WAIT.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.533
CAN GHOSTS SOUND
LIKE THE PEOPLE

13:28.533 --> 13:29.800
THEY'RE POSSESSING?

13:29.800 --> 13:30.800
OH, FRANKIE.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.867
YOU SILLY, SIMPLE GIRL.

13:31.867 --> 13:33.100
GHOSTS CAN'T--

13:33.100 --> 13:35.767
WHOA! I GUESS I CAN.

13:35.767 --> 13:38.300
- LOUIE, YOU JUST FOUND
A WAY TO SAVE

13:38.300 --> 13:39.500
TAYLOR'S FUNDRAISER.

13:39.500 --> 13:40.767
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

13:40.767 --> 13:43.367
YEAH, I AM.

13:43.367 --> 13:44.867
UGH.

13:44.867 --> 13:49.100
BUT I LOST MY GOOD LOOKS.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.300
- YOUR DATE WILL BE HERE SOON.
READY?

13:54.300 --> 13:56.633
- BOW TIE, CHECK.

13:56.633 --> 13:59.300
BACKUP BOW TIE, CHECK.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.133
- CHECK.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.267
- CRAZY LADY THAT WON'T GIVE
THE KID SPACE?

14:04.267 --> 14:05.967
CHECK.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.800
- OH, BOY, HERE SHE COMES.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.167
SHE IS...
ADORABLE!

14:11.167 --> 14:14.133
OKAY, MY CHILD.
WE'RE READY.

14:16.933 --> 14:19.067
RAY, YOU'RE OKAY
WITH ME GIVING

14:19.067 --> 14:21.733
ALL THIS AWESOME ADVICE
TO MILES, RIGHT?

14:21.733 --> 14:23.567
- ACTUALLY, AS HIS FATHER,

14:23.567 --> 14:25.067
I WAS REALLY HOPING HE MIGHT--

14:25.067 --> 14:26.233
- GOOD.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.633
BECAUSE I FEEL
WITH MY DATING HELP,

14:28.633 --> 14:30.367
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT FOR MILES.

14:30.367 --> 14:32.867
- WELL, IT'S OVER.

14:32.867 --> 14:34.900
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "OVER"?

14:34.900 --> 14:37.067
- TURNS OUT SHE'S INTO HAUNTING.

14:37.067 --> 14:39.133
AND THAT'S A LIFESTYLE
I COULD NEVER ACCEPT.

14:39.133 --> 14:41.567
- BUT I HAVE
SO MUCH MORE WISDOM TO SHARE.

14:41.567 --> 14:42.933
- SHH, SHH, SHH.

14:42.933 --> 14:47.200
NO, MICHELLE.
MY HEART NEEDS A BREAK.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.067
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S THAT.

14:50.067 --> 14:51.667
- HMM, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.133
- I SAID WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

14:59.067 --> 15:00.800
- WE'VE GOT A PACKED HOUSE
OUT THERE.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.233
DID YOU GET THROUGH TO SKYLER?

15:02.233 --> 15:03.833
HE WON'T PICK UP.

15:03.833 --> 15:05.433
BUT DON'T WORRY.

15:05.433 --> 15:07.767
I'VE GOT A BACKUP PLAN.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.900
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN ME
SOFT SHOE?

15:14.333 --> 15:17.267
- YAY! WE'RE SAVED.

15:20.333 --> 15:21.400
- HEY.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.067
HAS YOUR FUNDRAISER STARTED?

15:23.067 --> 15:25.900
- NO, BUT MY SOCIAL LIFE
HAS ENDED.

15:25.900 --> 15:29.200
- WELL,
THIS MIGHT CHEER YOU UP.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.300
- NO WAY!

15:30.300 --> 15:31.833
HI, TAYLOR! IT'S ME.

15:31.833 --> 15:36.100
FAMOUS POP-STAR PERSON,
SCHOONER MACKELROY.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.467
- I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING.

15:38.467 --> 15:39.967
WELL, THIS IS AWESOME!

15:39.967 --> 15:42.133
FRANKIE, YOU'RE THE BEST.

15:42.133 --> 15:45.300
I HAVE TO GO TELL
THE GIRLS.

15:45.300 --> 15:48.767
- OH, CAN'T YOU EVEN GET
HIS NAME RIGHT?

15:48.767 --> 15:49.933
WHAT?

15:49.933 --> 15:51.600
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF THIS DUDE.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.300
I'M NOT A POP GUY.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.067
- TAYLOR NEEDS US.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.833

I'M SKIPPER MULLRONEY.

16:13.633 --> 16:15.667

16:15.667 --> 16:18.700
- SORRY. BUT WHEN YOU SEE
THIS PORTRAIT ON THE WALL,

16:18.700 --> 16:22.467
YOU ARE GOING TO THANK ME.

16:22.467 --> 16:24.267

16:28.567 --> 16:29.733

16:29.733 --> 16:30.867
- I WAS TOLD TO COME HERE

16:30.867 --> 16:32.733
BECAUSE I WON SOMETHING?
- HMM.

16:32.733 --> 16:34.367
YOU DID WIN SOMETHING, WENDY.

16:34.367 --> 16:35.933
A CHANCE FOR HAPPINESS.

16:35.933 --> 16:38.367

16:38.367 --> 16:42.933
I KNEW IT.
YOU'RE NO PAINTER.

16:42.933 --> 16:44.200
- WHILE WE'RE ALL HERE,

16:44.200 --> 16:46.767
LET'S FOCUS ON
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.267
- MICHELLE,
WE WENT ON HALF A DATE.

16:52.267 --> 16:54.200
- WHICH COULD STRETCH
INTO A LIFETIME OF MEMORIES

16:54.200 --> 16:55.400
IF YOU WATCH THIS
LITTLE PRESENTATION

16:55.400 --> 16:56.600
I PUT TOGETHER.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.633
WHAT DID YOU DO?

IMPROVING YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

17:09.167 --> 17:13.167

17:13.167 --> 17:15.467
EYE CONTACT IS THE KEY
TO HAPPINESS.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.933
THE EYES ARE A WINDOW
TO THE SOUL.

17:17.933 --> 17:19.967
DAD...

17:19.967 --> 17:22.400
MICHELLE HAS CLEARLY LOST
HER MIND.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.533
- 3-D GLASSES ON!

17:24.533 --> 17:26.567
- YEAH, I'M SENSING THAT.

17:26.567 --> 17:27.733
DON'T WORRY, SON.

17:27.733 --> 17:28.867
I'LL FIX THIS.

17:28.867 --> 17:30.900
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.567
YOU'RE MISSING THE PART
WHERE I TALK ABOUT TRUST

17:36.567 --> 17:39.533
WHILE PADDLING A CANOE.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.100
- I DON'T CARE.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.300
I DON'T WANT TO DATE WENDY.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.600
SHE'S A HAUNTER.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.100
- WHOA, MILES.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.367
THIS SMART, LOVELY WOMAN WENT
TO ALL THIS TROUBLE

17:47.367 --> 17:49.667
BECAUSE SHE CARES SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

17:49.667 --> 17:51.500
- THANK YOU, RAY.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.633
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE

17:52.633 --> 17:54.067
SHE SEES YOU AS A SON.
- I DO.

17:54.067 --> 17:55.600
- AND SHE'D NEVER GET
SO CARRIED AWAY

17:55.600 --> 17:58.133
THAT SHE'D STEER YOU
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION

17:58.133 --> 18:00.933
JUST TO FEEL NEEDED.

18:00.933 --> 18:03.500
- YEAH...

18:03.500 --> 18:05.833
- SO IF SHE THINKS WENDY'S
GOOD ENOUGH

18:05.833 --> 18:08.600
TO DATE HER SON,
THEN YOU'D DO WELL

18:08.600 --> 18:11.567
TO CONSIDER IT.

18:11.567 --> 18:12.600
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.800
- WAIT!

18:13.800 --> 18:15.567
THAT GIRL IN THERE
IS A HAUNTER.

18:15.567 --> 18:17.867
THERE IS NO WAY
I CAN ALLOW MY SWEET MILES

18:17.867 --> 18:19.367
TO DATE
THE LIKES OF HER.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.533
OKAY. IF YOU SAY SO.
- MM-HMM.

18:22.533 --> 18:24.800
HOW AM I GONNA BREAK
THE NEWS TO WENDY?

18:24.800 --> 18:25.833
OH.

18:25.833 --> 18:27.500
SHE'S GONE.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.867
OOH, CHAPTER EIGHT.

18:29.867 --> 18:34.933
I'M RELEASING A DOVE.

18:34.933 --> 18:37.400
- DAD, THE WAY YOU JUST
TURNED MICHELLE AROUND

18:37.400 --> 18:38.400
WAS BRILLIANT.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.900
IF I EVER NEED ADVICE
ON WOMEN,

18:39.900 --> 18:41.300
I'M COMING TO YOU.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.333

18:42.333 --> 18:44.600
THE RAY PRESTON SCHOOL

18:44.600 --> 18:46.600
I LIKE IT.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.633

WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

18:48.633 --> 18:49.667
YOU WERE ON A DATE?

18:49.667 --> 18:50.767
- GET YOUR BUTT UPSTAIRS

18:50.767 --> 18:53.367
AND FINISH YOUR HOMEWORK.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.067
- I CAN'T BELIEVE

18:58.067 --> 18:59.367
- YEAH, YOU REALLY
STEPPED UP, TAY.

18:59.367 --> 19:01.567
- YOU'RE A HERO.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.700

19:31.467 --> 19:36.667

20:15.800 --> 20:19.533
- OKAY. OBVIOUSLY, LOUIE IS
OUT THERE POSSESSING SKYLER.

20:19.533 --> 20:21.767
- IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO GET SKYLER BACK

20:21.767 --> 20:23.000
FOR THE FUNDRAISER.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.700
- WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO HELP SO MUCH?

20:24.700 --> 20:28.400
THAT'S NOT VERY...YOU.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.467

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MY SISTER!

WHAT'S THIS?

20:47.133 --> 20:50.000

20:50.000 --> 20:52.067
WAS THIS

20:52.067 --> 20:55.633

THAT TRADITION IS LAME.

20:55.633 --> 21:01.333
LOOK, I'M SORRY I MESSED UP
YOUR FUNDRAISER.

21:01.333 --> 21:04.500

I KNOW WHY.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.733
IT TOOK TWO DAYS TO GET
THE SMELL OF CHEESE

21:06.733 --> 21:08.433
OUT OF MY HAIR.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.533
- AND THEN THE HOT SAUCE
GOT IN YOUR EYE

21:10.533 --> 21:14.567
AND WE HAD TO GO TO THE E.R.

21:14.567 --> 21:17.800
THAT--THAT PART WASN'T FUNNY.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.967
- ACTUALLY, IT KIND OF WAS.

21:19.967 --> 21:21.400
THE NURSE WITH BUG EYES?

21:21.400 --> 21:25.600
"THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW."

21:25.600 --> 21:28.233
- I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BLOWN OFF
CRAZY CAKES DAY.

21:28.233 --> 21:30.267
I MEAN, A DAY OF STUFFING
WEIRD FOOD

21:30.267 --> 21:32.100
INTO YOUR SISTER'S MOUTH?

21:32.100 --> 21:33.567
HOW COULD ANYONE
OUTGROW THAT?

21:33.567 --> 21:35.967
- MY SCHEDULE IS PRETTY OPEN
TOMORROW.

21:35.967 --> 21:38.067
- I'D LIKE THAT.

21:40.967 --> 21:45.767
OH! SO NICE TO SEE EVERYTHING
IN HERE IS GOING WELL.

21:45.767 --> 21:47.133
I JUST SPENT TWO HOURS

21:47.133 --> 21:49.467
TRAPPED IN A TWEEN DREAM
COVER BOY,

21:49.467 --> 21:58.233
BUT I'M FINE,
THANKS FOR ASKING.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.733
- ON YOUR MARK,
GET SET, EAT!

22:00.733 --> 22:03.467
WHOO!

22:03.467 --> 22:05.133
- UGH.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.900
- I'M GONNA HURL!
- GROSS!

22:09.900 --> 22:16.933
both: BEST DAY EVER!

22:19.933 --> 22:28.067
