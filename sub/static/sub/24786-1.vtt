- WHO DID IT?
- ALRIGHT-

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:10.925
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN
TOO MESSY, ALDEN.

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:12.327
WHERE'D YOU GET MY GUN?

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:17.031
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ME AND SLOAN.

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:19.000
SLOAN DIDN'T LIKE GETTING
HIS HANDS DIRTY.

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:21.669
HE TRUSTED TOO MUCH
IN THE MIDDLEMAN.

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:23.470
YOU KNOW, I NEVER CARED
FOR YOU MUCH, PRESTON.

01:17:23.494 --> 01:17:26.774
BUT I NEVER FIGURED YOU FOR
ONE THAT WAS AFTER THE MONEY.

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:29.243
SLOAN WAS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY,

01:17:29.244 --> 01:17:31.078
I WANTED THE POWER.

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:32.680
POWER?

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:35.149
POWER IN THESE TWO COUNTIES?
POWER OVER WHAT?

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.785
TO CONTROL CRIMINALS; OWN 'EM.

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:39.220
MAKE 'EM DO WHAT COPS CAN'T.

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:41.389
THAT DON'T MAKE YOU NO
DIFFERENT FROM THEM.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:42.923
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT.

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:44.324
A KID SPRAY PAINTS
UNDER A BRIDGE...

01:17:44.348 --> 01:17:45.826
YOU DON'T BRING HIM TO ME,

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:48.329
YOU MAKE HIM PAINT THE
BACK OF MADDIE'S.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.398
THAT'S NOT THE SAME.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:53.300
MAKSVILLE COUNTY IS A SAFER
PLACE BECAUSE OF ME,

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:55.237
AND YORK COUNTY
WAS ON ITS WAY...

01:17:57.205 --> 01:17:59.306

I HAVE THE PRATTLERS IN POCKET
TO TESTIFY AGAINST SLOAN.

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:13.821
YOU KILLED SLOAN OUT OF REVENGE;

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:15.823
I KILLED YOU...

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:17.858

GOOD SHERIFF, ALDEN.
