00:54.653 --> 00:56.621
Now we're not going to
have a problem are we?

00:56.689 --> 00:59.424
Thank the driver for me,
he was easy on the bumps.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.626
Yeah, yeah.

01:03.496 --> 01:04.696
What time is it?

01:04.763 --> 01:06.798
Five to nine. Let's go.

01:20.011 --> 01:22.479
Three inch concrete bolt
and an eye hook big enough

01:22.547 --> 01:23.713
to secure an elephant?

01:23.781 --> 01:27.950
Are you sure this
isn't overkill?

01:37.394 --> 01:40.529
I'm Officer Dewhurst,
Correctional Services.

01:40.596 --> 01:42.030
We're ready.

01:42.097 --> 01:43.298
Court's order says you've
got him for nine hours and

01:43.365 --> 01:44.900
not a minute more.

01:44.967 --> 01:46.961
We take him to Don Jail tonight
and he's back in the Pen

01:46.962 --> 01:48.136
tomorrow morning.

01:48.203 --> 01:51.873
That won't be soon enough.

01:51.941 --> 01:53.508
In there.

01:53.576 --> 01:55.310
I don't think you know who we're
dealing with here Sergeant.

01:55.377 --> 01:57.812
Oh, its Sergeant
now is it?

01:57.879 --> 02:00.714
I should have worn a tie.

02:24.772 --> 02:26.638
Hey Toby, come on
man stay with me.

02:26.700 --> 02:27.440
It's our last call.

02:27.507 --> 02:28.707
I've got a headache man.

02:28.775 --> 02:29.741
Can you keep your
eyes open at least?

02:29.809 --> 02:31.076
Why?

02:31.143 --> 02:32.077
I can't drive if
your eyes are closed.

02:32.144 --> 02:33.679
Makes no sense Oz.

02:33.746 --> 02:35.814
If you are sleeping it's
going to make me want to sleep.

02:35.882 --> 02:37.048
I'm not sleeping.

02:37.116 --> 02:38.617
How do I know that?

02:38.685 --> 02:40.218
We're having a
conversation.

02:40.286 --> 02:41.987
Yeah, it doesn't
surprise me.

02:42.054 --> 02:43.488
Between your shifts and
IIB you've been burning

02:43.490 --> 02:44.689
the candle at both ends.

02:44.756 --> 02:46.324
You know you need a jolt.

02:46.392 --> 02:49.327
See that thermos down there?
Can you grab it? Go ahead.

02:49.395 --> 02:50.595
What is this?

02:50.662 --> 02:52.263
It's my mother's
recipe, it's <i>chow gong</i>.

02:52.331 --> 02:54.065
It's turnip juice,
it's fantastic.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.034
You'll love it. Take a sip.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.137
Huh?

02:59.205 --> 03:00.337
Told you!

03:00.405 --> 03:01.338
Blaahhh.

03:01.406 --> 03:02.373
Good stuff.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.708
My tongue is on fire.

03:04.775 --> 03:06.843
Yeah, she's still
tweaking the recipe.

03:06.911 --> 03:08.278
Yeah, with Cayanne pepper?

03:08.346 --> 03:09.813
Listen, you drink that
whole thing and you will

03:09.881 --> 03:13.017
have a spring in your step
and a sparkle in your eye.

03:13.084 --> 03:14.918
Wow, that woke me up.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.285
Turnip, right?

03:16.353 --> 03:17.686
Yeah.

03:18.588 --> 03:19.655
Hey... chest pains?

03:19.723 --> 03:21.724
- Yeah.
- Alright.

03:21.791 --> 03:23.659
- What's her name?
- Justine.

03:23.961 --> 03:25.961
How you doing? I'm Toby.
Justine can you sit up?

03:26.161 --> 03:27.661
- Ah.
- Help you out...

03:27.831 --> 03:28.998
Ah, you have
trouble breathing?

03:29.066 --> 03:29.999
No.

03:30.067 --> 03:31.067
Ah, where's your pain?

03:31.135 --> 03:32.700
It's like a
knife right here.

03:32.768 --> 03:33.701
In your chest?

03:33.769 --> 03:34.403
Yeah.

03:34.410 --> 03:35.937
Anywhere else, your
arms, your head?

03:36.005 --> 03:37.305
No, just here.

03:37.373 --> 03:39.241
BP 110 palpate, pulse
is high but steady.

03:39.308 --> 03:41.476
How long ago did
you get the pain?

03:41.544 --> 03:43.278
Twenty minutes ago.

03:43.346 --> 03:44.946
Right after I drank
the milkshake.

03:45.014 --> 03:46.114
Am I having a
heart attack?

03:46.182 --> 03:47.149
You're not having
a heart attack.

03:47.216 --> 03:48.715
Can you help her?

03:57.659 --> 04:01.462
Hey, she didn't swallow
anything she wasn't

04:01.530 --> 04:04.264
supposed to, did she?

04:04.331 --> 04:06.466
Yeah.

04:06.534 --> 04:07.900
Alright it will
be alright.

04:07.968 --> 04:09.269
Hey Oz, let's call it in.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.904
- Yeah. Can you stand?
- Can you walk?

04:11.972 --> 04:13.039
We're going to walk
you over to the rig.

04:13.107 --> 04:15.442
She swallowed a ring.

04:16.509 --> 04:17.308
A ring?

04:17.310 --> 04:18.243
What's your name?

04:18.310 --> 04:19.045
Aaron.

04:19.113 --> 04:21.713
Toby, we'll take
care of you guys.

04:30.990 --> 04:33.358
The Maribel Heist,
the Canaccord job,

04:33.426 --> 04:35.227
the Bank of Canada?

04:35.295 --> 04:38.129
Magnus was
behind all of them?

04:38.197 --> 04:42.433
All unresolved, different
MO's, left no clues and

04:42.501 --> 04:43.934
the money was
never recovered.

04:44.002 --> 04:45.570
$50,000,000
over his career?

04:45.637 --> 04:48.606
Estimated, there's no
real way of knowing.

04:48.673 --> 04:54.077
Magnus, just the name screams
super criminal genius guy.

04:54.145 --> 04:57.013
Prison Psych team
tested his IQ.

04:57.081 --> 04:58.715
He scored off the
charts apparently.

04:58.782 --> 05:02.018
Still, someone managed to
catch the braniac.

05:02.086 --> 05:06.289
Yeah, I did.

05:07.325 --> 05:09.291
You knew that?

05:09.359 --> 05:10.792
Yeah, yeah.

05:10.860 --> 05:12.495
She doesn't like
to talk about it.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.800
Think we could
loosen these?

05:18.868 --> 05:21.337
For my circulation.

05:21.404 --> 05:25.006
Let's skip the coy games.

05:25.073 --> 05:29.277
Sergeant, not bad for
someone your age.

05:29.345 --> 05:30.678
Don't say I didn't have
anything to do with it.

05:30.746 --> 05:32.980
Least thing you could do
is tolerate my coy games.

05:33.048 --> 05:35.416
You said you wanted to
save someone's life.

05:35.484 --> 05:37.118
That time was of the
essence and that you would

05:37.186 --> 05:38.753
only talk to me so talk.

05:38.820 --> 05:40.720
What time is it?

05:40.788 --> 05:41.955
It's nine thirty-five.

05:42.023 --> 05:43.323
Then you still
have one hour.

05:43.391 --> 05:45.725
Until what?

05:45.793 --> 05:49.596
For eighteen days I shared a
cell with one Randy Coruthers.

05:49.664 --> 05:52.266
He was a chatty sort, told
me all sorts of things

05:52.333 --> 05:54.768
including what he was
going to do when he got out.

05:54.835 --> 05:58.304
He was released
six days ago.

05:58.372 --> 06:01.940
And what's he going to
do when he gets out?

06:02.008 --> 06:03.909
He's going to kidnap and
kill Superior Court Judge

06:03.977 --> 06:06.212
Brent Wilcott.

06:08.915 --> 06:10.416
I pulled this up,
Randy Coruthers.

06:10.484 --> 06:13.385
He grew up in Nova Scotia,
He ran away when he was 16.

06:13.452 --> 06:15.587
No friends, no known
associates, he served

06:15.655 --> 06:17.322
18 months for burglary.

06:17.390 --> 06:19.791
He was released six days ago
with $50.00 and a bus ticket.

06:19.858 --> 06:21.493
I can actually pull
up the court records.

06:21.561 --> 06:22.960
No we have to get down
to the court house.

06:26.965 --> 06:28.332
Judge Wilcott?

06:28.400 --> 06:30.133
Sergeant McClusky, IIB,
do you have a minute?

06:30.202 --> 06:33.270
Sonnenfeld, Wilcott is in
his Chambers in there.

06:33.338 --> 06:35.806
If you'll excuse me I'm
late for an appointment.

06:46.850 --> 06:48.318
Sergeant McClusky, IIB.

06:48.385 --> 06:50.820
Can we have a
word your honor?

06:52.022 --> 06:53.489
Has anyone
contacted my wife?

06:53.557 --> 06:55.958
We have officers outside
your house sir, she's fine.

06:56.026 --> 06:58.628
Does the name Coruthers
mean anything to you?

06:58.696 --> 07:00.029
Nothing comes to mind.

07:00.097 --> 07:03.998
Do you mind if I check
the court database?

07:09.572 --> 07:11.673
Here, this is the man,
he was recently paroled.

07:11.741 --> 07:13.108
He wouldn't be after me.

07:13.175 --> 07:15.110
Two years in Kingston is
enough time to build up

07:15.177 --> 07:16.410
some resentment.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.312
Only I didn't
try his case.

07:18.380 --> 07:21.982
Yeah, it was
Judge Sonnenfeld.

07:43.738 --> 07:46.406
Come on half the lot's empty do
you have to do this here?

07:46.474 --> 07:48.207
You're blocking my car.

07:54.010 --> 08:00.779
Sync & corrections by Alice
www.addic7ed.com

08:03.866 --> 08:05.300
You've been proposed
to before, right?

08:05.368 --> 08:07.035
Never.

08:07.103 --> 08:08.503
But you were married.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.105
I did the proposing.

08:10.173 --> 08:11.940
I know, sad.

08:12.008 --> 08:13.575
Should have been
my first clue.

08:13.642 --> 08:16.678
Yeah, but I mean there have
been other proposals, right?

08:16.745 --> 08:18.145
Nope.

08:18.213 --> 08:19.680
A few kicked tires but.

08:19.747 --> 08:22.016
Come on, a lovely
lady like yourself?

08:22.084 --> 08:24.651
You must have had
hundreds of guys.

08:24.719 --> 08:26.553
What is that
supposed to mean?

08:26.621 --> 08:30.757
No, not that you've had
hundreds of guys, I mean

08:30.825 --> 08:32.126
just there's probably
been three guys.

08:32.193 --> 08:33.259
You know little cue.
I'm going to shush.

08:33.327 --> 08:34.760
That's a good idea.

08:34.828 --> 08:36.198
- Yeah.
- Hey!

08:36.528 --> 08:38.198
You got everything covered?

08:38.265 --> 08:40.400
Yeah, inventory paperwork,
writing letters to myself,

08:40.467 --> 08:41.567
yeah pretty much
everything.

08:41.570 --> 08:42.168
Thank you.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.193
Right?

08:43.261 --> 08:43.659
Yeah.

08:43.664 --> 08:45.831
My tongue is numb
but my headache is gone.

08:45.898 --> 08:47.165
- Thank you,
- I'll make you another batch.

08:47.233 --> 08:48.466
My favorite cop.

08:48.534 --> 08:50.735
Hey, any chance you
can meet me at IIB?

08:50.802 --> 08:52.169
Yeah, what is it?

08:52.237 --> 08:53.771
A kidnapped Judge and a
man that is incapable of

08:53.839 --> 08:55.006
telling the truth.

08:55.073 --> 08:56.040
Give me an hour.

08:56.108 --> 08:57.374
Okay.

08:57.442 --> 08:59.010
We've got a fresh imprint
of the oil stains.

08:59.077 --> 09:02.379
Clear tread pattern,
it's a truck or a van.

09:02.447 --> 09:03.681
His wallet and court
case still inside the

09:03.749 --> 09:04.881
briefcase, car
keys on the ground.

09:04.949 --> 09:06.182
Quick snatch and grab.

09:06.250 --> 09:07.517
What about the
surveillance cameras?

09:07.584 --> 09:09.252
Sprayed with red paint,
same with the others all

09:09.319 --> 09:10.654
the way down.

09:10.721 --> 09:11.955
Okay find the tapes and
roll back to before they

09:12.023 --> 09:14.124
were blacked out and get
me the car that came in.

09:14.191 --> 09:16.492
How did the genius
get this wrong?

09:16.560 --> 09:19.195
Magnus is only wrong
when he wants to be.

09:19.263 --> 09:20.696
Then what were you
going to say to her?

09:20.764 --> 09:22.564
I don't know what
to say to her.

09:22.632 --> 09:24.099
You didn't have
anything planned?

09:24.167 --> 09:26.334
Ah, she was going to find
the ring in the milkshake

09:26.402 --> 09:29.038
and I was going to say,
let's get hitched.

09:29.105 --> 09:30.539
Hitched?

09:30.606 --> 09:32.407
Tractor trailers
get hitched.

09:32.475 --> 09:34.109
You have to be romantic.

09:34.177 --> 09:36.545
Okay, look I'm you, right?

09:40.215 --> 09:44.919
Life without you
is not worth living;

09:44.987 --> 09:48.589
love without you
is no love at all.

09:48.657 --> 09:49.623
Sandy, X-ray?

09:49.692 --> 09:50.825
Yep.

09:53.895 --> 09:57.630
This is a picture of your
heart and this is a symbol

09:57.699 --> 10:00.333
of mine.

10:00.401 --> 10:04.771
Will you marry me?

10:05.973 --> 10:08.641
Ah, that's good.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.310
Yeah, yeah, go
get her tiger.

10:11.377 --> 10:14.113
- Thanks bro.
- Yeah, get in there.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.152
I'm off at nine.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.456
She's off at nine...

10:27.659 --> 10:29.327
This is pretty serious,
he's in chains.

10:29.394 --> 10:31.495
Yeah, well he's made four
escape attempts in the

10:31.563 --> 10:33.098
last five years.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.566
Last time they put him in
solitary a few hours later

10:35.634 --> 10:38.302
they found him
outside the perimeter.

10:38.370 --> 10:42.672
Okay, go ask the right questions
and see what I can get.

10:55.854 --> 10:58.054
So you held on to that
information for six days

10:58.122 --> 11:00.056
and then you told
us the wrong Judge.

11:00.124 --> 11:02.024
Hmmm, sorry about that.

11:02.092 --> 11:03.559
You have to admit though
without me you wouldn't

11:03.627 --> 11:05.795
know anything at all.

11:05.863 --> 11:07.063
The first you would have
heard about this is

11:07.131 --> 11:09.165
when the Judge's
body turned up.

11:09.233 --> 11:12.401
Why don't you just tell me what
the hell it is you're up too?

11:12.469 --> 11:16.704
I would love to help my favorite
cop, got to love the irony.

11:16.773 --> 11:21.076
Where is Coruthers
keeping Sonnenfeld?

11:30.518 --> 11:32.486
Could be anywhere.

11:32.553 --> 11:36.657
Maybe it's all a
misdirect, like a magician?

11:36.724 --> 11:38.325
Want's you to look at his
right hand while the left

11:38.393 --> 11:39.827
is palming the card?

11:39.895 --> 11:41.728
Magician?

11:41.797 --> 11:43.097
I like that.

11:43.165 --> 11:44.731
Well you have made
four escape attempts.

11:44.799 --> 11:47.733
Five, you don't know
about my last one.

11:47.802 --> 11:51.137
Now you're out of Kingston, you're
ready for your disappearing act?

11:51.205 --> 11:55.108
Maybe I just wanted to
get you alone in a room.

11:55.176 --> 11:56.676
That sounds like a threat.

11:56.743 --> 11:59.445
How did you catch me?

11:59.513 --> 12:02.214
You weren't even in
charge of the case.

12:02.282 --> 12:06.384
A lot of cops worked
the Gold Corp case.

12:06.452 --> 12:10.422
But you're the
one that found me.

12:10.489 --> 12:14.592
I guess I got lucky.

12:14.660 --> 12:19.763
Thank you Sergeant.

12:19.832 --> 12:24.601
I find your honesty
refreshing.

12:37.648 --> 12:38.882
Did you get anything?

12:38.950 --> 12:41.084
I got nothing.

12:41.152 --> 12:42.485
Nothing?

12:42.553 --> 12:44.754
Nothing, I can't read his
thoughts, way too quick.

12:44.822 --> 12:45.856
Aren't everybody's
thoughts quick?

12:45.923 --> 12:47.290
No not this quick.

12:47.358 --> 12:48.691
I mean just picture
yourself sitting beside

12:48.759 --> 12:49.892
a highway trying to listen
to a conversation in

12:49.993 --> 12:51.560
a moving car, you
can't, right?

12:51.627 --> 12:54.897
He looks calm when his brain
is going a million miles a minute.

12:54.965 --> 12:56.265
Just slow it down.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.766
Oh yeah, that's right
I'll just press pause and

12:57.834 --> 12:59.835
rewind and press slow mo.

12:59.903 --> 13:01.337
Whoa, what did I do?

13:01.404 --> 13:02.938
It's my headache.

13:03.006 --> 13:04.306
Well I'll get you some more
of my mother's turnip juice.

13:04.374 --> 13:06.007
No, I appreciate that.

13:06.075 --> 13:07.441
I told her how much you liked
it; she'll make you some mee.

13:07.509 --> 13:11.179
It's no problem, really.

13:14.250 --> 13:17.651
You'd half expect him to
disappear like Houdini.

13:17.719 --> 13:20.821
I still can't believe it
was you that caught him.

13:20.889 --> 13:22.422
How did you do it?

13:22.490 --> 13:24.824
He wrote so taunting
leterers to the police,

13:24.893 --> 13:26.927
I was fresh out of cadet
training and enough time

13:26.995 --> 13:29.096
to look at the
syntax patterns.

13:29.163 --> 13:31.965
I tied them to an obscure
doctoral thesis and we

13:32.033 --> 13:34.101
traced him through that.

13:34.168 --> 13:35.969
Sounds like solid
police work.

13:36.037 --> 13:39.005
It was a fluke.

13:39.072 --> 13:41.774
He's got a doctorate?

13:41.841 --> 13:44.610
Two.

13:49.917 --> 13:51.150
Who, what, where?
What is this?

13:51.218 --> 13:52.584
Mr. Rimaldi in 407.

13:52.652 --> 13:54.485
I think he's trying to
extend his stay so he can

13:54.553 --> 13:55.620
see more of you.

13:55.687 --> 13:57.322
Oh, he's such
a sweetheart.

13:57.390 --> 13:59.190
Or I can tell him you're
planning on opening him up

13:59.258 --> 14:00.525
for a looksy.

14:00.592 --> 14:02.394
That would cure his
interest in surgeons.

14:02.461 --> 14:03.395
Hey Liv, you got a minute?

14:03.462 --> 14:04.930
Hey, yeah what's up?

14:04.997 --> 14:06.664
I want you to
check me out.

14:06.732 --> 14:07.832
Why, what's wrong?

14:07.900 --> 14:10.034
I don't know.

14:11.269 --> 14:12.602
Coruthers was supposed to
meet his parole officer

14:12.670 --> 14:14.405
last week he didn't show.

14:14.472 --> 14:15.505
We checked his
neighborhood, no one has

14:15.573 --> 14:16.740
seen him since he got out.

14:16.808 --> 14:20.177
The Judge's wife
got a ransom demand.

14:20.245 --> 14:21.545
Delivered?

14:21.612 --> 14:22.846
The courier said it
was left in a drop box

14:22.914 --> 14:24.581
downtown with a hundred
dollar bill taped to it.

14:24.649 --> 14:26.382
No way to find out
who dropped it off.

14:26.451 --> 14:28.351
Alright, let's see it.

14:31.255 --> 14:34.090
What is this place?

14:34.158 --> 14:37.427
What are those shadows?

14:53.910 --> 14:55.614
Listen carefully...

14:56.910 --> 14:58.614
One million dollars.

14:59.682 --> 15:04.085
That is the
cost of my life.

15:05.153 --> 15:10.191
It's to be delivered by
nine o'clock tonight.

15:10.258 --> 15:12.694
I will let you know where.

15:12.761 --> 15:15.028
Have it ready.

15:15.096 --> 15:19.533
He will be watching.

15:19.601 --> 15:24.504
No police or I die.

15:24.571 --> 15:27.974
Do as he says or
he will kill me.

15:35.463 --> 15:37.364
It's mainly these
intense migraines.

15:37.432 --> 15:39.734
So when did you
first notice it.

15:39.801 --> 15:41.235
This morning.

15:41.302 --> 15:43.771
Would you say it's connected
to your use of telepathy?

15:43.839 --> 15:45.239
What do you
think that means?

15:45.306 --> 15:46.840
I'm not sure.

15:46.907 --> 15:48.108
There's lots we don't know
about this ability of yours.

15:48.175 --> 15:49.142
It's could be from the
information input or

15:49.210 --> 15:51.444
how your brain is
processing it.

15:51.511 --> 15:54.114
We'll run some tests narrow
down some possibilities.

15:54.181 --> 15:56.116
In the mean time are you
taking anything for them?

15:56.183 --> 15:59.119
This turkish drink
that Oz gave me.

15:59.186 --> 16:00.120
Turkish drink?

16:00.187 --> 16:03.155
Yeah, it worked.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.556
Thank you. Thanks Liv.

16:04.624 --> 16:05.991
You're welcome.

16:06.760 --> 16:07.926
Coruthers never made it
past the sixth grade,

16:07.994 --> 16:09.361
I don't see him
setting this up.

16:09.428 --> 16:11.730
Right, or staking out
the Judge, knowing his

16:11.798 --> 16:13.198
movements, his schedule.

16:13.266 --> 16:14.233
Figuring out where all the
surveillance cameras were

16:14.300 --> 16:15.533
and taking them out.

16:15.601 --> 16:17.369
Getting a van and a
place to keep him,

16:17.436 --> 16:19.237
video equipment,
a computer to burn a DVD.

16:19.304 --> 16:21.705
Okay, what about Lex Luther
here, how is he connected?

16:21.774 --> 16:23.440
Well there's no doubt in
my mind that he's behind

16:23.508 --> 16:24.876
all of it.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.010
Okay well are there any
links between him and the

16:26.078 --> 16:27.411
kidnapped Judge?

16:27.479 --> 16:29.580
Nothing, in fact six
years ago when Magnus was

16:29.648 --> 16:31.415
arrested Sonnenfeld was
still serving as a justice

16:31.483 --> 16:32.917
of the peace.

16:32.985 --> 16:34.518
Alright, so warrant
applications, probable cause.

16:34.586 --> 16:36.219
None of them have anything
to do with Magnus.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.554
As far as I can tell they never
met, in court or otherwise.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.123
Okay, well he's been in
lock down since this

16:40.191 --> 16:42.325
started so he can't be
communicating with Coruthers.

16:42.393 --> 16:44.261
There has to be
someone else involved.

16:44.328 --> 16:46.863
Someone on the outside.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.030
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:51.034 --> 16:52.401
So we're going to
take another run at Magnus.

16:52.402 --> 16:53.849
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:53.850 --> 16:55.238
Okay, how is this going to
be any different than before?

16:55.306 --> 16:56.906
Well you're going to come
in with me this time.

16:56.907 --> 16:58.105
You ask the right
questions and get the read

16:58.108 --> 16:59.809
and I'm going to try
to slow him down.

16:59.876 --> 17:01.177
Okay.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.683
Magnus, this
is Agent Logan.

17:07.750 --> 17:08.849
He's going to help me out.

17:08.917 --> 17:13.755
I see.

17:13.823 --> 17:16.023
Just want to ask
you a few questions.

17:16.090 --> 17:18.059
Maybe you can help
us find the Judge.

17:18.127 --> 17:19.961
Are you an expert in
interrogation Agent Logan?

17:20.029 --> 17:20.962
No I'm not.

17:21.030 --> 17:22.531
No.

17:22.598 --> 17:26.233
This prisoner Coruthers,
I hear he's quite talkative.

17:26.301 --> 17:28.002
I also hear that he was
not the sharpest tool in

17:28.069 --> 17:29.603
the shed which makes me
wonder how interesting

17:29.671 --> 17:31.306
his conversations
must have been.

17:31.373 --> 17:33.741
If I were to limit my
conversations to those who

17:33.809 --> 17:37.245
understand me, Agent Logan,
it would be a very

17:37.313 --> 17:39.647
solitary existence indeed.

17:39.715 --> 17:41.215
Uh huh.

17:45.453 --> 17:47.855
But you're asking
the wrong questions.

17:47.922 --> 17:50.290
Oh, okay.

17:50.358 --> 17:52.025
What are the
right questions?

17:52.093 --> 17:54.661
Why are you assuming that
kidnapping the Judge

17:54.729 --> 17:56.095
was his idea?

17:56.163 --> 17:57.230
Maybe it was yours.

17:57.297 --> 17:59.332
See, presumptions.

17:59.399 --> 18:01.633
Tisk, tisk, tisk.

18:01.701 --> 18:02.902
Then who?

18:02.970 --> 18:04.770
You have to go
back into the past.

18:04.838 --> 18:07.773
Noah didn't build the
Ark when it was raining.

18:07.841 --> 18:09.742
Is this going to be
nothing but riddles?

18:09.809 --> 18:11.177
Because I'm beginning to
think that you don't have

18:11.245 --> 18:13.178
anything at all and this
was just an excuse for

18:13.246 --> 18:15.080
you to get out of
prison for a day.

18:15.147 --> 18:17.148
Well we rarely get to
spend any time together

18:17.216 --> 18:18.316
Michelle, you and I.

18:18.384 --> 18:19.450
Oh, its Michelle
now is it?

18:19.518 --> 18:21.586
Oh, I feel I know
you very well.

18:21.653 --> 18:22.854
Is that right?

18:22.922 --> 18:24.422
Uh huh.

18:24.490 --> 18:27.992
It must be very difficult
always feeling that you

18:28.059 --> 18:30.727
don't deserve
your successes.

18:30.795 --> 18:33.163
Always waiting for everyone
to find out you're a fraud.

18:33.231 --> 18:35.366
Does this sound familiar?

18:35.433 --> 18:38.202
It's called
"Imposter Syndrome".

18:38.270 --> 18:42.106
You tend to chalk up all
your achievements to luck.

18:42.173 --> 18:46.109
Like catching me.

18:49.779 --> 18:53.016
Just eats you up that a
little cadet brought you

18:53.083 --> 18:55.618
down, doesn't it?

18:55.685 --> 19:02.490
No silly child, that you
take no pride in it.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.567
It's quite common for
people that rise in their

19:12.635 --> 19:16.870
careers to quickly,
especially women Michelle.

19:16.939 --> 19:18.572
We're done.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.107
You're going
back to Kingston.

19:20.175 --> 19:22.076
Did he make his
ransom demand?

19:22.144 --> 19:24.912
Now why would I
share that with you?

19:24.980 --> 19:26.880
But I'm sure
you know, right?

19:26.949 --> 19:29.650
The real question is where
would a Judge get that

19:29.717 --> 19:32.518
kind of money?

19:39.360 --> 19:41.027
So what did you get?

19:41.095 --> 19:43.330
Well, when he got annoyed he
pictured you as a little girl.

19:43.397 --> 19:44.564
Of course he did.

19:44.631 --> 19:46.766
You guys aren't going
to believe this.

19:46.834 --> 19:49.534
So Airport Security
responded to our APB.

19:49.602 --> 19:51.536
This right there is Randy
Coththers, he's picking

19:51.604 --> 19:53.872
up a one way ticket to
Cuba, paid in cash.

19:53.940 --> 19:56.508
Brand new clothes, new
bag, got on the plane and

19:56.576 --> 19:58.043
he's out of the country.

19:58.111 --> 19:59.644
Okay, what
about the Judge?

19:59.712 --> 20:01.113
That's the thing.

20:01.181 --> 20:03.015
These photos were
taken five days ago.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.115
Before any of
this happened.

20:04.183 --> 20:05.616
So he had nothing
to do with this.

20:05.684 --> 20:08.686
What do you want to bet that
Magnus has paid him to disappear.

20:08.753 --> 20:14.258
So if it wasn't Coruthers
then who kidnapped the Judge?

20:22.378 --> 20:23.812
I've got the phone and visitor
records for Coruthers.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.781
No visitors but we've got
a dozen calls, all from

20:26.848 --> 20:29.184
the same number.

20:29.251 --> 20:33.119
Are you done with Magnus?

20:33.188 --> 20:34.854
You know Magnus
pretty well, right?

20:34.922 --> 20:38.058
Six years on his tier,
I know him as well as anybody.

20:38.125 --> 20:41.928
So why do you think he
came to us with this?

20:41.996 --> 20:46.400
Who knows, he could have
an agenda but then again

20:46.467 --> 20:48.133
he could just be
messing with you.

20:48.202 --> 20:51.504
Well, they say that
he runs Kingston Pen.

20:51.572 --> 20:53.472
There isn't a thing that
goes on in or out of that

20:53.540 --> 20:55.474
prison that he
doesn't know about.

20:55.542 --> 20:57.076
He controls the
black market.

20:57.143 --> 21:00.346
He's also the prison lawyer,
gives out legal advice to

21:00.414 --> 21:01.681
anyone who wants it.

21:01.748 --> 21:03.448
What about all the
escape attempts?

21:03.516 --> 21:06.184
No one has been able to escape
out of Kingston in years.

21:06.252 --> 21:09.987
If I had fifty million waiting
for me, I'd want out too.

21:10.055 --> 21:12.324
You really think that he has
that money stashed somewhere?

21:12.391 --> 21:16.194
If anyone could pull
it off, he could.

21:16.262 --> 21:20.631
Five hours left then I
have to take him back.

21:20.699 --> 21:23.166
So the calls to Coruthers,
we got a name Gregory Harrow.

21:23.235 --> 21:25.035
He's 15 minutes
away, you interested?

21:25.103 --> 21:26.737
Yeah, I'm in.

21:30.074 --> 21:31.442
Whoo!

21:36.480 --> 21:39.148
Gregory Harrow?

21:39.216 --> 21:42.918
Wait, don't tell me,
last month at Minx.

21:42.986 --> 21:44.487
Bought you vodka red
bull, we did the grind on

21:44.555 --> 21:47.957
the dance floor?

21:48.024 --> 21:48.958
Oh my bad.

21:49.025 --> 21:50.993
Yeah.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.128
Hey what's up?

21:52.195 --> 21:53.763
Hey.

21:53.830 --> 21:55.297
<i>Not what you
think, don't panic.</i>

21:55.365 --> 21:56.698
Can I see your phone?

21:56.767 --> 22:01.871
Yeah, what's
this all about?

22:01.938 --> 22:03.338
This looks brand new.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.941
Yeah, somebody stole my
old one from my locker.

22:06.009 --> 22:08.309
We know you've been in touch
with Randy Coruthers.

22:08.377 --> 22:09.577
Who?

22:09.645 --> 22:12.380
About a Judge,
Daniel Sonnenfeld?

22:12.447 --> 22:13.648
<i>It can't be that,</i>

22:13.715 --> 22:14.849
<i>they can't know
the connection.</i>

22:14.917 --> 22:18.253
<i>They're fishing,
they don't.</i>

22:27.628 --> 22:29.930
Doesn't ring
any bells, champ.

22:29.998 --> 22:31.899
Why did this guy
steal my old phone?

22:31.966 --> 22:34.334
No, but we'll be back
with more information

22:34.402 --> 22:38.138
and you will have a
better attitude.

22:38.206 --> 22:39.273
Can't wait.

22:39.340 --> 22:40.639
Got a good read,
he's lying.

22:40.707 --> 22:41.440
He knows Sonnenfeld and
there's something else

22:41.508 --> 22:42.474
very disturbing.

22:42.542 --> 22:43.976
What do you mean?

22:44.044 --> 22:45.278
There's a girl in a dorm
room, she looked terrified.

22:45.345 --> 22:49.182
I think he did
something to her.

22:51.218 --> 22:55.822
We have four hours left and
I'm clutching at straws here.

22:55.889 --> 22:57.423
Do you think I got what
I did through luck?

22:57.490 --> 22:58.957
What, come on.

22:59.025 --> 23:03.128
No, my father always said
luck is when preparation

23:03.196 --> 23:04.596
meets opportunity.

23:04.664 --> 23:07.666
So then I'm an
opportunist.

23:07.734 --> 23:10.703
I mean, you have to
be good to be lucky.

23:10.770 --> 23:15.172
You ask anybody out there
including me, you're good.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.108
He just has me rattled.

23:18.176 --> 23:20.144
I checked Sonnenfeld's
bank records and over the

23:20.212 --> 23:22.847
last decade I found
periodic influxes that

23:22.914 --> 23:24.014
aren't accounted for.

23:24.082 --> 23:25.316
How much?

23:25.384 --> 23:26.718
Well they're all cash
deposits under the

23:26.785 --> 23:29.185
reporting limit but over
the years added up it's

23:29.253 --> 23:30.821
close to three
quarters of a million.

23:30.888 --> 23:32.456
Okay what about
Sonnenfeld's wife?

23:32.523 --> 23:33.890
Well she claims to
know nothing about it.

23:33.958 --> 23:35.158
I believe her.

23:35.226 --> 23:36.960
I mean the accounts
were well hidden.

23:37.027 --> 23:40.096
So we have to find out who
was paying him and for what.

23:40.164 --> 23:42.165
Okay what about Harrow,
do you have anything on him?

23:42.233 --> 23:43.867
No arrest record but I did
find something interesting

23:43.934 --> 23:45.234
in the papers.

23:45.301 --> 23:46.235
News article?

23:46.302 --> 23:47.503
No... the society pages.

23:47.571 --> 23:50.673
His father owns
Martel Industries.

23:50.741 --> 23:52.641
Young Gregory was the most
eligible bachelor in the

23:52.709 --> 23:56.311
year 2007; he was the
swim champion in college.

23:56.380 --> 23:57.713
Could have made
the Olympic team.

23:57.781 --> 23:59.314
Yeah, if sleaze were
an Olympic event.

23:59.383 --> 24:00.349
Yeah.

24:00.416 --> 24:01.816
Is there anything else?

24:01.884 --> 24:03.485
Just he's used to living
high off the hog, suddenly

24:03.552 --> 24:04.886
he's dead broke.

24:04.953 --> 24:06.020
Had a little spat with
daddy, cut off his trust

24:06.088 --> 24:07.422
fund last year.

24:07.490 --> 24:09.991
Okay check the University
Campus records. Toby said

24:10.058 --> 24:11.793
something about a
connection with a young girl.

24:11.861 --> 24:15.930
Young girl, Okay,
wish me luck.

24:15.998 --> 24:17.364
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:17.432 --> 24:19.099
Hey , so we're
going in there?

24:19.166 --> 24:23.737
Just you, I need you to find
Magnus's link to the case.

24:23.805 --> 24:25.906
Uh, just me
and Magnus? Really?

24:25.973 --> 24:28.442
It's worth a shot.

24:40.186 --> 24:42.221
You told us the Judge was
going to be kidnapped.

24:42.289 --> 24:44.189
But it was the wrong Judge.

24:44.257 --> 24:46.893
You said that Coruthers
was going to do it,

24:46.960 --> 24:50.028
but he was already
out of the country.

24:50.095 --> 24:51.863
You're wringing us around,

24:51.931 --> 24:54.633
you're not even
trying to hide it.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.435
Right now all I'm trying
to do is figure out who

24:56.536 --> 24:59.203
you are, Mr. Logan.

24:59.271 --> 25:02.373
I know you're not who
you pretend to be.

25:02.442 --> 25:06.243
Okay, who do
you think I am?

25:06.277 --> 25:07.945
Your clothes aren't
high-end pro casual like

25:08.012 --> 25:09.947
the Sergeant's, they're
not cheap enough for

25:10.014 --> 25:11.849
undercover, so I know
you're not police.

25:11.917 --> 25:13.717
You're eyes aren't blood shot,
so I know  you're not the

25:13.785 --> 25:19.289
partying type and I'd say
you've been up for what 20 hours?

25:19.357 --> 25:21.458
You do shift work.

25:21.525 --> 25:22.725
You are very observant.

25:22.726 --> 25:24.894
You believe in
evil, Mr. Logan?

25:25.162 --> 25:26.330
- Do I believe in evil?
- Yes.

25:26.897 --> 25:28.131
- I've seen evil.
- Have you?

25:28.399 --> 25:29.133
Yes.

25:29.201 --> 25:30.367
Have you looked
in the eye.

25:30.435 --> 25:31.069
Yes, I have.

25:31.136 --> 25:33.970
Well then you know the only way
to cure it is to cut it out.

25:34.438 --> 25:37.940
To surgically excise
it and destroy it.

25:38.007 --> 25:40.943
Sounds to me like you're
on a mission for justice.

25:41.010 --> 25:45.447
Oh, I don't believe in
justice, <i>per se</i>,

25:45.515 --> 25:48.617
I believe in just desserts.

25:48.685 --> 25:52.787
And this, did you
get what you deserve?

25:52.855 --> 25:58.693
I was put in prison for
chasing money, Mr. Logan.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.895
Money means
nothing to me now.

26:02.998 --> 26:06.767
<i>Just think Coruthers
$100,000.</i>

26:12.272 --> 26:15.074
Officer Dewhurst you're a
sight for sore eyes.

26:15.142 --> 26:17.243
I hope you've had a
productive day.

26:17.311 --> 26:21.214
You're nine hours
are up Magnus.

26:21.281 --> 26:25.818
I booked a nice cozy room
for you at the Don Jail.

26:25.886 --> 26:28.387
You're going back to
Kingston in the morning.

26:28.454 --> 26:30.122
Vacation's over.

26:30.189 --> 26:36.729
Oh well, it was fun
while it lasted.

26:36.796 --> 26:43.335
Who else knew the Judge had
enough money for the ransom?

26:43.403 --> 26:46.505
Whoever gave it to him.

26:46.572 --> 26:50.775
Goodnight Mr. Logan,
get some sleep.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.251
I think he paid
Coruthers to disappear.

27:00.318 --> 27:02.019
Tomorrow morning he goes
back to Kingston so

27:02.087 --> 27:03.787
whatever he's planned
has already happened.

27:03.855 --> 27:05.256
Or it's about to.

27:05.323 --> 27:06.524
It's almost six o'clock so
we have three hours

27:06.591 --> 27:08.659
until the ransom
demand runs out.

27:08.726 --> 27:11.462
Yeah, he kept on talking
about revenge in there,

27:11.530 --> 27:13.329
you gotta believe that
he's got a reason to go

27:13.397 --> 27:14.864
after the Judge.

27:14.932 --> 27:18.568
Assuming that Judge Sonnenfeld
was his only target.

27:22.573 --> 27:23.739
What's this?

27:23.807 --> 27:25.141
Her name is Andrea Fry.

27:25.209 --> 27:26.509
Five years ago she was
strangled, her body left

27:26.577 --> 27:27.910
in the woods.

27:27.978 --> 27:29.045
She was a student at
University of Toronto

27:29.112 --> 27:31.780
around the same
time as Harrow.

27:31.847 --> 27:36.385
Guys this is the girl I
saw when I read Harrow.

27:36.453 --> 27:38.387
I will check with
Toronto Homicide.

27:38.455 --> 27:41.056
I think we just
caught a break.

27:44.094 --> 27:46.561
Detective Ramiro do you
remember Andrea Fry?

27:46.628 --> 27:48.496
Do forget a
case like that.

27:48.564 --> 27:51.199
It was brutal,
she was an orphan.

27:51.266 --> 27:52.833
Run through the system.

27:52.901 --> 27:55.803
She lands this amazing
scholarship, full ticket

27:55.870 --> 27:58.872
to any school she wants.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.774
Fairy tale story, right?

28:01.842 --> 28:04.244
She ends up at U of T
Business school.

28:04.312 --> 28:06.913
Rarified air, kids
with silver spoons.

28:06.981 --> 28:08.348
And Frat houses right?

28:08.416 --> 28:11.551
Yeah, keg parties.

28:11.619 --> 28:13.786
Girls brought in from all
over campus, suddenly it's

28:13.854 --> 28:15.755
not a fairy tale anymore.

28:15.823 --> 28:17.456
Not for Andrea.

28:17.524 --> 28:22.261
She ends up raped with
a cord around her neck.

28:22.329 --> 28:24.095
We're interested with a
prime suspect from that

28:24.163 --> 28:26.063
case, Gregory Harrow.

28:26.132 --> 28:28.566
The guy was just
wrong all over.

28:28.634 --> 28:31.269
I knew in my bones he was
the one who did Andrea.

28:31.337 --> 28:32.937
So why did the
case go sideways?

28:33.005 --> 28:34.372
I had to prove that she
was in Harrow's room that

28:34.440 --> 28:37.609
night, no question that's
where he killed her.

28:37.676 --> 28:39.709
All I needed was a warrant
and I had the evidence to

28:39.777 --> 28:41.745
nail his ass.

28:41.812 --> 28:43.447
Let me guess the Judge wouldn't
sign the warrant, right?

28:43.515 --> 28:45.715
Son of a bitch says
there's no probable cause,

28:45.783 --> 28:47.184
can you believe that?

28:47.252 --> 28:50.687
Witness's started shutting up,
nobody there on her side,

28:50.755 --> 28:52.356
an orphan girl?

28:52.423 --> 28:54.991
It all just fell to
pieces after that.

28:55.059 --> 28:56.892
Harrow skated away.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.894
Do you remember the
name of the Judge?

28:58.962 --> 29:03.699
Oh yeah, real piece of
work, Daniel Sonnenfeld.

29:16.776 --> 29:18.575
Hey Dev, would you mind
printing off a few copies

29:18.643 --> 29:20.444
of this image for me?

29:20.512 --> 29:21.645
- No problem.
- Thank you.

29:58.481 --> 30:00.549
<i>What does that look like
to you in the back ground?</i>

30:00.616 --> 30:01.650
Looks like a trophy.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.285
<i>Yeah, a swimming trophy.</i>

30:03.353 --> 30:05.020
Harrow was a champion
swimmer with a dozen

30:05.088 --> 30:07.121
trophies just like this
in his college dorm room.

30:07.189 --> 30:10.524
I got it in my reading.

30:10.592 --> 30:12.327
A little over five years
ago Gregory Harrow was

30:12.394 --> 30:15.663
suspected of murdering a
woman in college, Andrea Fry.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.098
Only they can't get a
search warrant for his

30:17.166 --> 30:19.600
place because Judge
Sonnenfeld won't sign.

30:19.668 --> 30:21.836
And then the Judge starts
to receive cash every month

30:21.903 --> 30:24.071
over the years it adds up to
three quarters of a million.

30:24.138 --> 30:25.638
Now if we can show the
money leaving Harrow's

30:25.706 --> 30:27.474
account and reappearing
in the Judge's.

30:27.541 --> 30:30.077
Yeah only now he's cut
off from daddy's funds,

30:30.144 --> 30:31.644
he's totally broke.

30:31.712 --> 30:32.445
So he decides to kidnap
the Judge and make his own

30:32.513 --> 30:34.481
money back in ransom.

30:34.548 --> 30:36.884
So is the almighty Magnus
behind this or not?

30:36.951 --> 30:38.284
I don't know yet.

30:38.352 --> 30:39.551
I still don't know how
arranging the get out of

30:39.619 --> 30:42.221
jail for a day and taking
a field trip to IIB

30:42.289 --> 30:43.722
figures into it.

30:43.790 --> 30:45.557
He could pull all the same
strings from behind bars.

30:45.625 --> 30:47.693
We have about an hour
until ransom demand runs out;

30:47.761 --> 30:49.161
we need to search
Harrow's apartment,

30:49.229 --> 30:51.364
his car, the locker at
his gym, everything we can.

30:51.431 --> 30:53.266
Alright give me a minute I
will write it up and get

30:53.333 --> 30:55.901
you a warrant.

31:04.076 --> 31:05.210
Open it.

31:05.278 --> 31:06.511
This is crazy.

31:06.578 --> 31:08.613
It's included in
the warrant sir.

31:08.680 --> 31:10.247
Open it.

31:36.840 --> 31:37.873
What's this?

31:37.942 --> 31:39.075
That isn't mine.

31:39.143 --> 31:40.743
None of that is mine.

31:40.811 --> 31:41.744
I have no idea where
that came from?

31:41.812 --> 31:43.145
Where are your trophies?

31:43.212 --> 31:44.579
My what?

31:44.647 --> 31:46.014
Your swimming trophies
from college, they're not

31:46.082 --> 31:47.582
in your apartment,
where are they?

31:47.650 --> 31:50.652
B17, it's a UStore
at 601 Queensway.

31:50.719 --> 31:51.954
Come on let's go.

32:04.433 --> 32:06.434
There.

32:15.042 --> 32:16.376
You okay?
You okay?

32:16.444 --> 32:17.444
Yeah?

32:17.511 --> 32:18.744
Thank god.

32:30.023 --> 32:31.723
So they say other than
being dehydrated you're

32:31.791 --> 32:33.592
going to be fine.

32:33.659 --> 32:37.896
Feel like hell, well
thank God you found me.

32:37.964 --> 32:41.066
Do you think you'll be able
to identify your kidnapper?

32:41.134 --> 32:44.870
He wore a mask the entire
time, didn't talk to me.

32:44.937 --> 32:46.437
He just wrote notes.

32:46.505 --> 32:50.708
Maybe because you would
have recognized his voice.

32:50.775 --> 32:52.743
We know about the bribe,
how Harrow has been paying

32:52.811 --> 32:57.382
you off all these years.

32:57.449 --> 33:02.252
Do you remember
Andrea Fry?

33:02.320 --> 33:04.888
I don't, no.

33:04.955 --> 33:06.456
Well you were given a
warrant to sign that would

33:06.524 --> 33:10.327
have put away her killer
but you wouldn't sign it.

33:10.395 --> 33:16.433
Even now you're still
protecting him.

33:22.339 --> 33:25.174
Hey wait, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to be on a date.

33:25.242 --> 33:27.776
Yeah, Sandy got
her shift extended.

33:27.844 --> 33:31.013
Five car pileup came in,
multiple injuries, you know.

33:31.081 --> 33:32.448
Oh I saw that Judge at the
hospital,

33:32.516 --> 33:33.549
yeah you guys found him.

33:33.616 --> 33:34.849
Yeah he's a bad dude.

33:34.917 --> 33:36.918
Ha, two bad dudes
for the price of one.

33:36.985 --> 33:39.587
Justice is served.

33:39.655 --> 33:41.622
Just desserts.

33:41.690 --> 33:43.925
No, that's not
what I said no.

33:43.992 --> 33:46.428
It' all too neat.

33:46.495 --> 33:47.628
What's too neat?

33:47.696 --> 33:48.963
You know I'm not
mind reader, right?

33:49.031 --> 33:52.366
The bag in the locker,
the shadow of the trophy,

33:52.434 --> 33:54.201
paying the guy
to go to Cuba.

33:54.269 --> 33:57.237
I know the guy did it I
just don't know how or why.

33:57.305 --> 33:59.406
Why, who did what, how?

33:59.474 --> 34:00.541
Where.

34:00.609 --> 34:01.776
Where?

34:01.843 --> 34:03.510
Jail, I got to
go to the jail.

34:03.579 --> 34:06.547
Oh the jail, oh yeah
now it makes sense.

34:15.206 --> 34:16.373
Hey.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.809
Hey.

34:17.876 --> 34:19.643
I was able to get you ten
more minutes with Magnus.

34:19.712 --> 34:21.878
Alright I think I
have a way in there.

34:34.592 --> 34:35.626
Hello Mr. Logan, are you
here to tell you just who

34:35.693 --> 34:36.926
you really are?

34:36.994 --> 34:38.494
Mr. Police consultant.

34:38.561 --> 34:40.295
I'm a paramedic.

34:40.362 --> 34:41.831
What do you take me for?

34:41.898 --> 34:43.465
It's the truth,
it's what I do.

34:43.533 --> 34:45.567
Pick people up, fix them up,
bring them to the hospital.

34:45.636 --> 34:48.070
Good people, Bad
people, doesn't matter.

34:48.138 --> 34:50.873
It's not that complicated,
neither are you.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.940
Oh you've got me all
figured out, now do you?

34:53.009 --> 34:55.409
Yeah, I mean you're just
like the rest of us.

34:55.476 --> 34:58.346
You're flesh and bone,
driven by emotions.

34:58.413 --> 35:02.383
Love, hate,
regret, revenge.

35:02.451 --> 35:05.353
By now you've found you're
Judge in peril, you've got

35:05.420 --> 35:06.855
your kidnappers.

35:06.922 --> 35:08.456
What are you really
doing here Mr. Logan?

35:08.524 --> 35:12.793
Well, I just want
to understand you.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.729
With all due respect
Mr. Paramedic,

35:15.797 --> 35:18.533
you don't have the capacity?

35:18.600 --> 35:22.270
Who's Andrea Fry?

35:34.382 --> 35:36.716
She was your daughter.

35:36.784 --> 35:38.652
No, I don't ha...

35:45.124 --> 35:46.525
...who are you?

35:46.593 --> 35:48.360
Played your hand
perfectly, you got

35:48.428 --> 35:50.929
Sonnenfeld,
you got Harrow.

35:50.997 --> 35:53.031
You ran the table.

35:53.099 --> 35:54.132
Did I?

35:54.201 --> 35:57.102
Yeah, you did.

35:57.170 --> 35:58.403
What is it?

35:58.470 --> 36:03.208
You don't look
satisfied, what's next?

36:03.275 --> 36:07.412
Your loss must have been
very grave, Mr. Logan.

36:07.479 --> 36:08.646
My loss?

36:08.714 --> 36:11.249
To see all this?

36:11.317 --> 36:15.051
The pain must have been
overwhelming, a wife perhaps?

36:15.119 --> 36:18.121
A parent?

36:18.189 --> 36:22.326
A mother, hmm?

36:27.131 --> 36:29.765
Well we all experience
grief and we all deal with

36:29.833 --> 36:35.104
it differently.

36:35.171 --> 36:36.739
Seems I have
underestimated you

36:36.806 --> 36:43.779
Mr. Logan, perhaps you
underestimated me too.

36:43.847 --> 36:46.348
Good luck with your grief.

37:00.796 --> 37:01.995
You can take him in.

37:02.063 --> 37:03.096
You don't mind?

37:03.164 --> 37:04.798
Not a problem.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.116
Andrea Fry is
Magnus's daughter.

37:24.184 --> 37:25.551
What?

37:25.619 --> 37:28.588
There was no record
of having any kids.

37:28.656 --> 37:30.256
When he couldn't escape
from prison he came up

37:30.324 --> 37:31.991
with this plan to get
revenge on his daughter's

37:32.058 --> 37:35.294
murderer and disgrace the
judge who protected him.

37:35.361 --> 37:38.997
So what are you in for?

37:39.064 --> 37:44.770
Oh, I have many
sins to account for.

37:44.837 --> 37:51.509
Pride, greed. I'm actually
thinking about having one more.

37:51.576 --> 37:53.811
Yeah what's that?

37:53.878 --> 37:57.381
Wrath.

38:00.819 --> 38:06.423
<i>Stay cool,
they don't suspect a thing.</i>

38:06.490 --> 38:09.926
<i>$10,000,000.</i>

38:14.699 --> 38:17.200
You're
the outside man.

38:17.267 --> 38:18.301
What?

38:18.369 --> 38:20.102
Toby are you
sure about this?

38:20.170 --> 38:22.604
Magnus paid Dewhurst
he's helping him.

38:22.672 --> 38:24.105
He couldn't escape so he
did the next best thing

38:24.173 --> 38:26.608
He brought Harrow to him
with Dewhurst's help.

38:26.676 --> 38:27.909
Into the same damn cell.

38:27.977 --> 38:29.144
Okay, keep him here.

38:29.212 --> 38:32.981
I need you to
buzz us in now. Come on.

38:42.458 --> 38:47.228
Magnus let him go,
let him go, let him go!

38:47.295 --> 38:48.696
He's mine!

38:52.735 --> 38:56.336
Our appointment with
destiny has merely been delayed.

39:11.485 --> 39:12.986
Hey.

39:13.053 --> 39:14.487
Hey.

39:14.554 --> 39:16.722
I had 10 hours of
sleep and I feel great.

39:16.790 --> 39:18.124
Hmmm, what about
the headaches?

39:18.192 --> 39:20.626
They come and go but the
over the counter stuff

39:20.694 --> 39:22.161
works perfectly.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.829
Well we could still
run those tests.

39:23.898 --> 39:25.198
No, I'm good.

39:25.266 --> 39:27.699
I've stopped drinking
the turkish drink.

39:27.767 --> 39:29.801
I wish I could say this is
just an outlier event but

39:29.869 --> 39:31.636
I'm still concerned.

39:31.704 --> 39:34.206
Liv it's nice that
you care about me,

39:34.274 --> 39:36.041
it's nice having
someone worry aboutt me.

39:36.109 --> 39:38.377
I'm just saying you've got
ot take care of yourself.

39:38.444 --> 39:39.711
- Alright.
- Okay.

39:39.779 --> 39:40.812
Thank you.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.346
Your welcome.

39:45.450 --> 39:47.285
So when Harrow's convicted
they are going to have to

39:47.352 --> 39:50.087
keep them as far away
from Magnus as possible.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.989
You really think that's
going to keep him safe?

39:52.057 --> 39:53.824
I doubt it but you have to
admit Magnus almost got

39:53.892 --> 39:55.426
away with it.

39:55.493 --> 39:57.094
It was pretty close but
you've stopped him twice now.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.895
With a little help.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.397
Oh, we all need a little
that doesn't make your

40:00.464 --> 40:03.099
accomplishment any less.

40:03.167 --> 40:05.335
You have to be good
to be lucky, right?

40:05.403 --> 40:07.503
You have to be good to know
what to do with the luck.

40:07.571 --> 40:11.741
Well it's nice to just take
a moment, don't you think?

40:11.809 --> 40:14.709
Yes, what do you want?

40:14.777 --> 40:16.912
What's good, you said
you were just here.

40:16.980 --> 40:20.382
Ah, I hear the milk shake
is full of surprises.

40:20.450 --> 40:23.652
Two chocolate
milkshakes please?

40:23.719 --> 40:24.653
You buying?

40:24.720 --> 40:26.021
I am.

40:26.089 --> 40:27.990
Thank you, Toby Logan.

40:28.058 --> 40:29.158
Thank you.
