02:19.405 --> 02:21.273
- Emma and the kids
weren't too happy about me

02:21.275 --> 02:22.875
moving them closer to town,

02:22.877 --> 02:23.976
but it was best
for the business.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.645
- Let me help you out here.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.247
- Thanks.
- - Hey, Jake.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.081
- Bob Collins.

02:29.083 --> 02:29.781
- Nice to meet you, Bob.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.416
- This is Seth.
- - How you doing?

02:31.418 --> 02:32.751
- Seth Collins.
- Nice to meet you.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.119
- All right, good luck.
- Thanks.

02:34.121 --> 02:34.720
- Hello, Seth, Bob.

02:34.722 --> 02:35.721
- Hey, Preacher Sam!
- Looking good!

02:35.723 --> 02:37.489
- Preacher Sam, how you doing?

02:37.491 --> 02:40.159
- I'm doing good.
Well, see you all tomorrow.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.828
- Yeah, let's give it a ring.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.833
Oh yeah, should be all right.

02:49.969 --> 02:52.504
- I remember when Mama
used to ring that bell

02:52.506 --> 02:54.006
'til our feet hit
the front porch.

02:54.008 --> 02:57.376
Used to drive Daddy crazy.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.511
- He'd be proud.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.214
- Yes, he would.

03:02.216 --> 03:06.151
This is for him, for the family.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.453
- Collins brothers.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.656
We got us a business
that we can share.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.258
The hard work is
going to pay off, too.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.426
- God's been good to us.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.328
I'm just happy to
have my baby brother

03:16.330 --> 03:18.397
as my business partner.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.331
Look, I gotta run.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.866
I gotta meet Emma and
the kids at the pond,

03:20.868 --> 03:22.801
and she don't like me
being late for anything.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.803
- Well, you better go
and get out of here, Bobby.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.206
I'll see you and the family
tomorrow for the Grand Opening.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.674
- You know it.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.475
See you then.

03:36.950 --> 03:37.616
- I'm hungry, Pops.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.451
- Well, you know
I think Mama, she made

03:39.453 --> 03:41.954
some corn bread and
some homemade jam.

03:41.956 --> 03:42.888
Y'all ready for a picnic?

03:42.890 --> 03:45.857
- Yes.
- All right, come on.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.860
- This is for you, Miss Emma.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.863
- Thank you, sweetheart.

03:53.132 --> 03:54.566
All right.

03:56.102 --> 03:56.902
- Thanks, Mom!

03:56.904 --> 03:59.805
- Let's go.
- Michael, wait up.

04:01.674 --> 04:03.408
- How's the store looking?

04:03.410 --> 04:04.476
- Tomorrow's a big day.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.545
We've even got Grandma's
dinner bell hanging outside.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.913
- That loud thing?

04:07.915 --> 04:10.315
I'm sure the customers are
really gonna like that.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.150
- It ain't that loud.

04:12.152 --> 04:12.851
- Yes, it is.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.419
That thing sounds
like a train coming.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.887
- Well, I'll tell you what.
We never missed a meal.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.925
- Oh yeah, you right about that.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.661
- What else you got in there?

04:22.663 --> 04:23.862
- Some jam.

04:23.864 --> 04:27.399
- There's a biscuit, too.
- - Yes, indeed.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.935
- Every time I see
that tree over there,

04:29.937 --> 04:32.904
it reminds me of when
I was a little boy.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.741
Me and my daddy, we
planted this little seed.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.443
It grew into something
really beautiful.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.712
That's how God is with us.

04:40.714 --> 04:45.250
He takes our family and
He rains down His love.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.903
- Daddy?

05:09.676 --> 05:11.576
Hey, Pop!

05:15.715 --> 05:17.282
Daddy.

06:08.634 --> 06:10.769
- He ain't here.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.809
We found him this morning...

06:18.711 --> 06:21.546
facedown in the creek.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.591
Ain't but a foot deep.

07:43.229 --> 07:48.266
- Matty, do you know
what happens in the woods

07:48.268 --> 07:51.670
when all the wolves die out?

07:52.205 --> 07:53.138
- No, I don't, Snake.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.608
- When they get hunted down...

07:57.176 --> 07:57.776
that's when they move in.

07:57.778 --> 08:01.780
- What are you
even talking about, Snake?

08:08.154 --> 08:10.121
- What about the store, Matty?

08:10.123 --> 08:13.525
First the store, then
what? The whole town?

08:13.527 --> 08:14.893
No.

08:16.295 --> 08:19.030
I ain't gonna let them...

08:21.200 --> 08:23.001
take our town.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.108
That store was my daddy's store,

08:30.110 --> 08:34.312
your daddy's store.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.847
- I know.

08:36.782 --> 08:39.217
Why does it have to be
anybody's store, Snake?

08:39.219 --> 08:40.418
Can't it just...

08:40.419 --> 08:42.754
Can't you just let it...

08:42.756 --> 08:44.121
Just let it be?

08:44.124 --> 08:46.958
- You always was soft.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.028
- Okay.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.931
We're gonna to scare 'em well.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.536
Let's run them out of town
for good, Snake, me and you.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.803
The Cain brothers.

08:58.805 --> 09:01.373
Let's do it, let's do it!

09:02.676 --> 09:05.110
Let's do it, yeah!

09:12.885 --> 09:15.253
I ain't soft.

09:15.788 --> 09:16.321
Snake!

09:16.323 --> 09:18.957
- Where are them kids?

09:18.959 --> 09:21.459
- They was here somewhere.
- - I have no ide...

09:21.461 --> 09:22.494
- Check the closet.

09:22.496 --> 09:23.595
- Closet.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.230
I know they're here somewhere.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.465
Mama Bear, did you
see those kids?

09:27.467 --> 09:28.667
- No!
- - Mama Bear!

09:28.669 --> 09:31.202
- No!
- - A-ha!

09:31.204 --> 09:33.305
I see 'em.

09:37.877 --> 09:39.611
Where are those kids?

09:39.613 --> 09:43.982
I'm gonna eat those kids.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.585
- Uh-oh.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.186
- I'm gonna get ya.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.255

09:56.195 --> 09:59.764
- Oh, babe. Come get into bed.

10:00.132 --> 10:02.767
Y'all know you can't
hide from Papa Bear.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.036
There you go, son.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.373
I love you, baby girl.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.842
- I love you, too, Daddy.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.380
- Michael.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.582
Don't I get a goodnight kiss?

10:17.584 --> 10:19.050
- Too old, Dad!

10:19.052 --> 10:20.518
- Too old?

10:20.520 --> 10:23.455
How about an "I love you"?

10:23.457 --> 10:25.724
- Too old!

10:25.726 --> 10:27.158
- Well, I tell you what.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.761
Tomorrow's opening
day for the store.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.530
I want my son to
be the first one

10:32.532 --> 10:35.400
to ring that bell so loud

10:35.402 --> 10:37.235
that the whole town will hear.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.204
- Really?!
- - Really.

10:39.206 --> 10:42.073
- All right!
- - All right.

10:42.075 --> 10:46.878
- Okay. You guys

10:46.880 --> 10:48.513
- Dad?

10:48.515 --> 10:49.848
I love you.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.816
- I know, son.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.919
Love you guys.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.222
Night!

10:59.725 --> 11:00.959
Mmm, Mama Bear!

11:00.961 --> 11:03.695
Papa Bear wants some honey.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.865
- Come on then, Papa Bear.

11:08.467 --> 11:09.401
- Come on, Jake!

11:09.403 --> 11:10.802
- Come on, Jake!

11:10.804 --> 11:13.271
- I'm comin', hold on.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.042
- Jake, where ya going?

11:17.044 --> 11:19.444
I made your favorite,
mashed potatoes and gravy!

11:19.446 --> 11:21.546
- I'm just going out with
the boys to get some beers.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.380
That's all. No harm.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.417
- When did you start
drinking again?

11:25.419 --> 11:27.318
- Come on!

11:28.688 --> 11:30.422
- Who are those boys?

11:30.424 --> 11:31.189
- Snake and Matty.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.958
I met 'em at the
stables, hangin' around.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.260
- Do they work there?

11:35.262 --> 11:35.560
- No.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.530
Listen, Carrie. Just put
my food on the warmer.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.166
I'll be back later, all right?

11:41.168 --> 11:43.368
Hey, their uncle is
Sheriff Joe Cain.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.470
I mean how much
trouble could I get in?

11:50.577 --> 11:51.409
- Okay.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.611
- I'll see you later!

11:53.613 --> 11:54.612
- I love you.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.947
- I know you do.

11:56.282 --> 11:59.084
- Let me guess,
she made your favorite.

12:00.020 --> 12:04.389
You know, Jake, 50% of
marriages fail for a reason.

12:09.161 --> 12:12.764
- Don't do nothing stupid now.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.567
- Just gonna scare 'em, Joe.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.035
That's it.

12:17.037 --> 12:20.338
- That's it.
- You got it, Joe.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.040
- You're gonna
go on a little ride

12:22.042 --> 12:24.542
with me and Matty here.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.377
- Sheriff.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.453
- Raise 'em up, boys.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.492
To the brotherhood.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.727
To the brotherhood.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.362
- Brotherhood.

12:50.669 --> 12:51.536
- Woo!

12:51.538 --> 12:54.873
- Ah!
- Burns.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.744
- You boys have fun, now.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.854
- You sure know
how to make a man

13:09.856 --> 13:11.689
feel good, Mama Bear.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.760
- I'm just proud of you.

13:15.762 --> 13:18.396
You been working so, so hard,

13:18.398 --> 13:21.299
for so long, on this one.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.035
- Still a lot to do.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.938
Got a long way to go.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.109
- You sure you and Seth
know what you doing?

13:32.913 --> 13:36.981
- Well, we gonna be all right.

13:37.449 --> 13:38.983
If the store is successful,

13:38.985 --> 13:44.189
it can go a long way in
healing a lot of old wounds.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.924
Besides, honey.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.592
God done brought us this far.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.628
We can't turn around now.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.100
- Okay.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.805
You comin' in?

14:00.906 --> 14:02.574
- I'll be in in a minute.

14:02.576 --> 14:05.677
- I trust you, Bob.
- Okay.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.286
- I know what you all up to.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.722
I don't want no trouble.
This is my property.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.624
Go on home, now.

14:52.626 --> 14:56.060
If you leave now, we'll just
act like this never happened.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.396
- I tell you what.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.365
Kinda hoping you don't forget.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.934
I don't think you're
understanding me.

15:03.770 --> 15:07.505
The big picture,
we don't like you.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.308
We don't want you here.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.379
- I don't care
whether you like me or not.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.481
What I do know,
this is my property!

15:16.483 --> 15:18.249
I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you!

15:18.251 --> 15:20.718
Now, get on outta here!

15:20.720 --> 15:21.419
- Bob?

15:21.421 --> 15:24.222
- It's okay, Emma.
Just get on back inside.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.624
Go on. Get back inside.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.927
- Done gone and
made me real mad.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.362
- Shep, get 'em!

15:40.106 --> 15:41.472
- No!

15:44.244 --> 15:46.010
What're you doing?!

15:46.012 --> 15:49.013
- No, no, no, Jakey.

15:49.181 --> 15:51.382
You're one of us. Remember?

15:51.384 --> 15:54.018
The brotherhood.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.687
We gonna burn 'em.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.588
- Burn 'em?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.024
- Matty?
- - Yeah?

16:00.026 --> 16:02.460
- Light it up.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.928
- Now?

16:04.196 --> 16:06.097
- Right now.

16:06.231 --> 16:09.167
- No, Matty! No!

16:11.303 --> 16:12.670
Matty, don't do it.

16:12.672 --> 16:13.404
- Fire works.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.572
- Throw it on the porch.

16:14.574 --> 16:18.076
- No, Matty! Don't do it!

16:18.078 --> 16:20.144
He's got kids in there.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.347
- Get in the truck.

16:25.217 --> 16:27.085
Now!

17:47.232 --> 17:50.334
- Bob lost
his wife and two kids.

17:50.336 --> 17:53.538
- Yeah, it's a real pity.

17:53.939 --> 17:57.208
- Doesn't look like an accident.

17:57.210 --> 17:57.775
- Of course, it was.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.545
- There's a
bottle on the porch.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.146
- Hey!

18:02.347 --> 18:05.083
It was an accident.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.152
- Sure.

18:10.255 --> 18:15.626
- How do we rise above
the ashes of such a loss?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.295
The loss of a good woman,

18:17.297 --> 18:20.665
and her two innocent children?

18:20.667 --> 18:24.302
This is an unthinkable pain.

18:24.304 --> 18:29.107
A pain that reaches to the
deepest recesses of our soul.

18:29.109 --> 18:33.144
There are no human
words to console,

18:33.146 --> 18:37.281
but there is
comfort in His word.

18:37.283 --> 18:41.452
The word ministers to our soul,

18:41.454 --> 18:44.255
calms our spirit,

18:44.257 --> 18:45.990
brings new life into us,

18:45.992 --> 18:49.794
and gives us the
reason to live again.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.531
"Fear not, for I am with you."

18:53.533 --> 18:57.101
Isaiah 41:10.

19:24.998 --> 19:28.299
- The last thing
I said to my wife

19:28.301 --> 19:30.601
was, "Trust in God."

19:33.273 --> 19:35.339
It was God that let this happen.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.769
- I could use a little
help around the store today.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.138
- I plan on going fishing.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.341
- I'm going fishing, too.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.077
- Sit down, sweetie.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.878
- May I be excused?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.214
- You haven't
finished eating yet.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.682
- Go.

20:52.651 --> 20:53.517
- Yes, Ma.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.853
- Yeah, go.

20:57.489 --> 21:00.591
What? Tell.

21:01.226 --> 21:04.262
- You know I have nightmares.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.763
I do.

21:07.132 --> 21:11.636
I see that flaming
bottle in my sleep.

21:11.638 --> 21:12.903
Why Bob?

21:12.905 --> 21:14.605
- We can't change the past.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.173
We have to move on.

21:16.175 --> 21:19.443
- You even know where he lives?

21:19.445 --> 21:21.879
- No, I don't.

21:22.347 --> 21:23.314
He wants it that way.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.016
- Is that what
you tell yourself?

21:25.018 --> 21:27.151
- You don't think
I want him to come back?

21:27.153 --> 21:30.021
You don't think I haven't tried?

21:30.023 --> 21:32.556
He hardly talks anymore.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.258
Not even to me.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.826
He comes into the store,

21:35.828 --> 21:39.764
gets what he needs, and leaves.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.033
He's built a wall
around himself,

21:42.035 --> 21:45.136
and ain't nobody gonna
get through that.

21:45.138 --> 21:48.472
- Then, you've got
to keep trying.

21:55.547 --> 21:57.615
- Jake?

21:59.518 --> 22:00.885
Jake.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.828
You need to go home now, son.

22:27.145 --> 22:30.414
- It's early.
- - Yup.

22:30.916 --> 22:33.084
- You were out all night again.

22:33.086 --> 22:34.452
- I'm tired.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.687
- I am, too.

22:36.988 --> 22:40.358
- Yeah, well
I work all day long.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.059
- So do I.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.127
- Yeah, right.

22:43.129 --> 22:46.697
- What, you think I
just sit around all day?

22:48.567 --> 22:51.035
Can't be going out on the town,

22:51.037 --> 22:54.672
spending our money on drinking.

22:54.674 --> 22:57.475
- Yeah, our money.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.877
You mean, my money.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.347
I earned it.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.816
It's my money. I earn it.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.352
I'll do what I wanna do with it.

23:08.354 --> 23:10.087
You could get a job.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.889
You can go out
and pay the bills,

23:11.891 --> 23:15.359
and I'll stay home and
play with the kids.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.195
- You don't even know your kids.

23:47.025 --> 23:49.160
- That rabbit.

23:49.162 --> 23:50.961
If you'd have been there...

23:50.963 --> 23:52.897
you would've caught that
rabbit, and I wouldn't have

23:52.899 --> 23:56.834
to waste time
throwing that knife.

23:59.404 --> 24:02.673
I do miss 'em though.

24:02.675 --> 24:05.042
I miss 'em, boy.

24:05.744 --> 24:09.647
Now, I'm out here by myself.
Ain't nobody but me and you.

24:09.649 --> 24:12.116
You my best friend now.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.819
You're my everything now.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.054
Yeah.

24:36.341 --> 24:40.511
- I got you!

24:59.364 --> 25:01.131
- Who's there?

25:10.375 --> 25:12.076
Man, am I hearing things?

25:12.078 --> 25:14.879
Huh?! What?!

25:14.881 --> 25:17.515
Hey, wait.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.682
Come back here!

25:18.684 --> 25:19.884
Come back here.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.752
I'm gonna get you!

25:21.754 --> 25:23.621
You can't get away from me!

25:23.623 --> 25:26.857
Come here!

25:28.360 --> 25:29.793
Think you can mess with me?

25:29.795 --> 25:31.428
- Had your head spinning.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.531
- That was luck.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.000
Here, give me your hand.

25:37.435 --> 25:38.536
Now, if you don't mind,

25:38.538 --> 25:41.305
I have some fish to catch.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.207
- Wait. Where you going?

25:43.209 --> 25:45.910
Can't you tell me?

25:45.912 --> 25:46.744
- No.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.445
- Is it a secret?

25:50.515 --> 25:51.715
Well, if you ain't
gonna tell me,

25:51.717 --> 25:54.251
then I'm just gonna follow you.

25:58.456 --> 25:59.723
- Here it is.

25:59.725 --> 26:03.761
The best fishing spot around.

26:03.763 --> 26:04.528
- Wow.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.263
I ain't never seen this.

26:06.265 --> 26:10.534
- You just have to know
the right path to follow.

26:10.536 --> 26:11.835
Come on.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.241
- Here, let me help.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.544
First, you need some real bait.

26:20.546 --> 26:22.880
Fresh from the soil.

26:24.549 --> 26:26.550
Deer jerky, take a
little pull of this

26:26.552 --> 26:28.185
to give it some extra muscle.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.755
- Wait, did you just pull
the worm and the deer jerky

26:31.757 --> 26:33.257
out of the same pocket?

26:33.259 --> 26:36.827
- It looks cool when
you chew it, too.

26:39.799 --> 26:43.233
- Did your dad teach
you how to cast a pole?

26:43.235 --> 26:45.903
- I ain't got no daddy.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.039
- Maybe you could meet my dad.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.608
- I got something!
- You did?

26:50.610 --> 26:52.209
- Bay, I
actually got something!

26:52.211 --> 26:54.311
- Hold onto it with two hands!

26:54.313 --> 26:55.813
- Help me! Help me!

26:55.815 --> 26:57.581
Grab it!

26:57.682 --> 26:59.350
Grab it! Grab it!

26:59.352 --> 27:01.251
- I got it.

27:01.653 --> 27:02.519
I got it. Oh!

27:02.521 --> 27:05.789
- Hey, hey!
- - We caught a fish!

27:05.791 --> 27:07.257
- It's slippery.

27:07.959 --> 27:12.129
- Well, duh, it's slippery.
It's been in the water.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.299
- High five!
Give me a high five!

27:22.641 --> 27:23.540
What do you see?

27:23.542 --> 27:25.242
- A Bigfoot and a dog.

27:25.244 --> 27:28.012
- Wait! What?!

27:28.680 --> 27:31.248
- Let me see!
- - Shh!

27:33.318 --> 27:34.718
- We gotta go!

27:34.720 --> 27:35.386
- Run!

27:35.388 --> 27:38.088
- Come on!
Let's get outta here!

27:38.090 --> 27:41.225
Hey, wanna do this
again after church?

27:41.227 --> 27:43.961
- Church?
- - Yeah!

27:44.729 --> 27:46.730
- Don't you go to church?

27:46.732 --> 27:48.799
- I've never been.

27:49.334 --> 27:52.803
- The church is on the
hill, off of Old Route 37,

27:52.805 --> 27:54.972
just past the fork in the road.

27:54.974 --> 27:55.974
You can't miss it.

27:55.975 --> 27:59.043
All you have to do
is just look up.

27:59.045 --> 28:03.380
- Okay, see ya then.
- - Okay, bye.

28:08.253 --> 28:11.288
- Mom says you went fishing.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.390
Bet you didn't catch nothin'.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.025
- Not much.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.161
- Not much?

28:44.622 --> 28:47.124
- What're you two up to?

28:47.826 --> 28:49.293
No good?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.963
- Thinkin' about it.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.698
- Sheriff.

28:54.966 --> 28:58.068
I need to get your
signature on these reports.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.705
- You sign 'em.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.007
- Yes, sir.

29:04.409 --> 29:04.975
- Whatcha need?

29:04.977 --> 29:09.179
A little cash'd be good.

29:09.181 --> 29:14.585
- You boys ever
gonna settle down,

29:14.587 --> 29:16.787
find you a good woman,

29:16.789 --> 29:18.188
maybe a job?

29:18.190 --> 29:19.957
- Why?

29:21.025 --> 29:22.760
- You got me.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.963
Why work, when you can mooch?

29:26.464 --> 29:29.399
- Thank you, Uncle Joe.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.071
Hey, uhh...

29:34.372 --> 29:39.009
You ever hear anything else
about the older Collins brother?

29:39.944 --> 29:42.880
- What older Collins brother?

30:16.214 --> 30:16.613
- Hey, Pete.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.215
- Hey, Jake.
What're you drinking?

30:18.217 --> 30:20.951
- The usual.
- - You got it.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.620
- Where you been, Jake?

30:23.622 --> 30:25.255
Ain't seen you in a while.

30:25.257 --> 30:25.689
- That's five.

30:25.691 --> 30:29.359
- You're not too good
for us now, are you?

30:30.261 --> 30:31.128
- Thanks.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.563
- No, just not, you know?

30:32.565 --> 30:35.032
I been in a mood lately.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.068
- Wanna have a
little fun tonight?

30:38.070 --> 30:40.237
Pop some coyotes?

30:40.805 --> 30:43.273
- Nah, not tonight.

30:45.043 --> 30:48.445
- Gotta get that
fire outta your head, boy.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.816
It's been a while, now.

30:54.819 --> 30:59.489
You startin' to make
me real nervous.

31:01.092 --> 31:03.327
I get a little crazy...

31:04.529 --> 31:06.997
when I get nervous.

31:13.771 --> 31:16.073
- A little crazy?

31:17.842 --> 31:20.978
Now, you know that man saw us.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.219
- What I know...

31:29.988 --> 31:32.923
is that that old man...

31:33.091 --> 31:36.059
way off in the woods.

31:36.928 --> 31:38.262
Which is exactly

31:38.264 --> 31:41.999
where we want him.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.310
Hey, Gibby!

31:53.678 --> 31:55.012
Deputy Gibby!

31:55.113 --> 31:57.648
Be sure to tell this
fine, little lady here

31:57.650 --> 31:59.316
you ain't never kissed no girl.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.551
I mean you're law
man, after all.

32:01.553 --> 32:02.786
You should always
tell the truth.

32:02.788 --> 32:05.122
- Yeah, Snake. Whatever, okay?

32:05.124 --> 32:08.258
Well, you know I've got
my uniform in the car.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.727
I can go put it
on and arrest you.

32:14.899 --> 32:18.602
- You catch yourself another
beatin' like you did last year.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.305
Keep runnin' that mouth.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.839
- Just...

32:22.841 --> 32:23.807
joking.

32:23.809 --> 32:26.176
- A joke.

32:35.887 --> 32:39.022
- Now, you know you ain't
the law around here.

32:39.024 --> 32:41.591
- Well, sure we are!

32:42.760 --> 32:45.295
Don't you forget that.

32:47.065 --> 32:50.067
Law around here...

32:52.603 --> 32:54.972
is what we make it.

33:09.687 --> 33:11.154
What is this, church?!

33:11.156 --> 33:13.724
Who wants to drink with
the brotherhood, huh?!

33:16.328 --> 33:18.595
Fill me up, Matty!

33:33.678 --> 33:35.846
- You been in your
head all morning, Jake.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.647
What's going on?

33:40.885 --> 33:42.252
- I'm good.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.755
- No. No, you're not.

33:44.757 --> 33:45.922
I've known you
long enough to know

33:45.924 --> 33:48.492
when something's
up, so what's up?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.661
- Thinking about leaving Carrie,

33:51.663 --> 33:53.997
moving onto another town.

33:53.999 --> 33:55.365
I don't know.

33:55.367 --> 33:58.101
Just wanna be by myself.

33:59.937 --> 34:01.038
- What about the kids?

34:01.040 --> 34:04.007
Your job? You just
can't run off.

34:05.343 --> 34:06.243
- Why not?

34:06.245 --> 34:08.978
I woke up this morning
doubting everything, Frank.

34:08.981 --> 34:11.380
I got two kids and a
wife I can't relate to.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.617
- Yeah, well no one
said marriage is easy.

34:13.619 --> 34:16.018
You have to work at it.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.954
- I tried, Frank.

34:17.956 --> 34:18.789
I mean no offense.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.623
I'm thankful for the job
you've given me at the stable,

34:20.626 --> 34:23.393
but there's gotta
be something more.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.629
- It's an honest living.

34:25.963 --> 34:29.099
You're providing
for your family.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.835
- Yeah, barely.

34:32.838 --> 34:35.938
- You know that
my wife gave up on me.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.541
Gave up on us.

34:37.842 --> 34:42.045
Thought there was something
better out there, I guess.

34:42.047 --> 34:42.913
Long time, I blamed myself,

34:42.915 --> 34:46.917
but eventually I realized
it wasn't my fault.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.219
She just didn't wanna
be married anymore.

34:50.222 --> 34:53.889
She did the easy thing and
just gave up on the marriage.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.559
See, the problem with
doing that though

34:55.561 --> 34:59.596
is it creates a lot
of pain on both sides.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.198
Trust me.

35:01.332 --> 35:03.200
Think about this, Jake.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.935
Think about what you're doing.

35:04.937 --> 35:08.738
- Well, maybe people
ought not get married.

35:09.707 --> 35:12.576
- You know what you have?

35:12.977 --> 35:16.146
Beautiful wife,
beautiful kids...

35:17.148 --> 35:18.582
I want that.

35:18.916 --> 35:22.385
I'll probably never
have a child of my own.

35:22.387 --> 35:25.088
But I want what you have.

35:26.157 --> 35:28.024
- Thou shalt not covet.

35:28.026 --> 35:29.126
You just broke a commandment.

35:29.128 --> 35:32.596
- Yeah, I think you
know what I mean.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.800
- I'm sorry for throwing
all this on you, Frank.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.002
- Then maybe you should
put those big-boy pants on

35:39.004 --> 35:41.104
and man up.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.875
Be a father.

35:44.877 --> 35:46.576
Be a husband.

35:46.911 --> 35:50.847
It's family, Jake. It's
the greatest gift of all.

35:57.788 --> 36:00.123
- I'm done.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.269
- Lord, we bless your name.

36:46.271 --> 36:48.171
Hallelujah!

36:50.007 --> 36:50.974
Come on, put your hands together

36:50.976 --> 36:53.510
for our preacher,
Preacher Sam, come on!

36:53.512 --> 36:54.012
- Amen!

36:57.883 --> 36:59.683
What a wonderful God we have!

36:59.685 --> 37:03.220
This morning, my sermon comes
to you from the book of...

37:03.222 --> 37:04.788
- What're you doing here?

37:04.790 --> 37:07.290
- I figured I'd come try it out.

37:07.292 --> 37:08.525
- Who, among you,

37:08.527 --> 37:12.062
if he has 100 sheep,
and loses one of them,

37:12.064 --> 37:15.565
does not leave the
99 in the wasteland,

37:15.567 --> 37:19.035
and follow the last
one until he finds it?

37:19.037 --> 37:23.006
There will likewise be
more rejoicing in heaven

37:23.008 --> 37:25.308
over the repentance
of one sinner,

37:25.310 --> 37:28.411
than over 99 righteous people

37:28.413 --> 37:31.214
who have no need to repent.

37:31.216 --> 37:35.285
- Amen!
- - Amen!

37:36.887 --> 37:39.289
- When those Cain
boys gonna repent?

37:39.291 --> 37:41.391
- We let the law do its job.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.792
- Preacher, that
sheriff ain't done nothin'

37:42.794 --> 37:45.362
about what happened
to that man's family.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.630
- We put our trust in God.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.165
We don't follow man's
law, we follow God's law.

37:49.167 --> 37:54.704
Amen, let the church say amen.

37:56.407 --> 37:57.707
- You did pretty good up there.

37:57.709 --> 38:00.343
- Oh, I get a little
happy, if you know what I mean.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.078
Preacher Sam,
pleased to meet you.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.480
- Hey, Preacher Sam.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.015
- Who are the Cain brothers?

38:05.017 --> 38:08.518
- They're a couple of
boys needing prayers.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.986
- Let's go, Puck.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.321
- Nice meeting
you, Preacher Sam.

38:11.323 --> 38:12.522
- Nice meeting you, too.

38:12.524 --> 38:13.723
- Come on, let's go!

38:13.725 --> 38:15.659
- Okay!

38:25.436 --> 38:26.136
- Stick 'em up!

38:26.138 --> 38:28.204
- You scared the
crawdads outta me, Bay!

38:28.206 --> 38:30.707
Don't do that!

38:30.709 --> 38:33.009
- Now, we're even.

38:33.011 --> 38:34.277
You seen anything?

38:34.279 --> 38:35.312
- Ain't seen nothin' yet.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.547
Old man's been
sleeping on his porch.

38:37.549 --> 38:40.317
Seems like forever.

38:40.818 --> 38:43.953
- You'd think he'd be
thirsty, or hungry...

38:43.955 --> 38:45.855
- Hasn't moved a muscle.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.358
I just don't get how he could
stay still for that long.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.060
- I could stay still forever.

38:50.062 --> 38:53.463
- Pff, sure.
- - Yeah.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.431
- Get off, Bay.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.132
- What're you talking about?

38:56.134 --> 38:57.667
- Get your hands off of me!

38:57.669 --> 38:59.602
- What're you talking about?

38:59.604 --> 39:01.571
Get your hands off...

39:01.573 --> 39:03.173
Uncle Bob?

39:03.175 --> 39:03.907
- Come on.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.975
- Oh, we're so busted.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.445
- You know better, Bay.

39:11.849 --> 39:15.151
- Oh, no. No
wonder he didn't move.

39:15.153 --> 39:17.854
- Here. Sit down.

39:19.390 --> 39:19.890
- Yes, Sir.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.658
- You wanna tell me why you two

39:21.660 --> 39:23.526
been snoopin'
around my property?

39:23.528 --> 39:27.864
Trespassing is against the
law. You know that, don't you?

39:32.670 --> 39:35.338
- I wouldn't mind being
that scarecrow right now.

39:35.340 --> 39:36.439
- It was her idea.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.375
I just wanted to go home.

39:38.377 --> 39:39.042
- What?!

39:39.044 --> 39:39.943
You know you wanted
to check him out!

39:39.945 --> 39:42.078
You said he was some sort
of Bigfoot or something.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.279
- Did not!
- - Did so!

39:43.281 --> 39:45.915
- I did not!

39:48.753 --> 39:49.285
You.

39:49.287 --> 39:51.955
You have some real
neat stuff, Uncle Bob.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.289
Did you make all this?!

39:53.291 --> 39:55.024
- Yeah, it's all pretty cool.

39:55.026 --> 39:58.661
Wish I could make
stuff like this.

39:58.663 --> 40:01.064
- Come on, Puck.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.567
- Yeah. I made 'em.

40:04.569 --> 40:10.306
- The other day, I was looking
at a picture on your mantle.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.475
Is that your family?

40:24.622 --> 40:26.623
I'm Puck.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.063
What's your dog's name?

40:34.999 --> 40:36.800
- Shep.

40:37.168 --> 40:40.003
- Cool, I like that name.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.939
Come on, Bay.

40:43.474 --> 40:46.409
- Bye, Uncle Bob.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.679
- Every time I see
that tree over there,

40:49.681 --> 40:52.182
it reminds me of when
I was a little boy,

40:52.184 --> 40:54.918
and me and my daddy, we
planted this little seed

40:54.920 --> 40:58.021
that grew into something
really beautiful.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.290
That's how God is with us.

41:00.292 --> 41:04.427
He takes our family, and
He rains down his love,

41:04.429 --> 41:08.465
and we become all
that we can be.

41:17.943 --> 41:19.542
- Bob?

41:19.544 --> 41:20.677
- I love you, too, Daddy.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.045
- Dad, I love you.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.347
- I know, son. Love you guys.

41:36.460 --> 41:39.162
- I trust you, Bob.

41:52.710 --> 41:54.577
- What you doing, son?

41:54.579 --> 41:55.945
- Changing the battery,

41:55.947 --> 41:58.381
but I wanna check the oil first.

41:58.383 --> 41:59.682
- Yeah?

41:59.684 --> 42:02.986
All right, well I don't have
to be at work for a while.

42:02.988 --> 42:04.387
Would you like to go for a walk?

42:04.389 --> 42:06.422
- I'll go when you get back.

42:06.424 --> 42:07.490
It's just a battery.

42:07.492 --> 42:09.726
- It's just a
battery. Looks good.

42:09.728 --> 42:13.663
Sounds good. All right,
I'll see you in a bit.

42:14.765 --> 42:16.900
- Want some lemonade?

42:17.601 --> 42:18.835
- Yeah.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.876
- Hello?

42:35.452 --> 42:36.953
- Hey, Bob.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.755
I, uhh...

42:39.356 --> 42:41.224
got your things.

42:48.432 --> 42:50.800
Salt, sugar, cereal,

42:50.802 --> 42:53.303
toothpaste, and

42:53.305 --> 42:55.038
toilet paper.

42:58.742 --> 43:01.110
It's good to see you, Bob.

43:07.384 --> 43:10.720
Man, these are beautiful.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.056
Even trade?

43:13.058 --> 43:14.657
- Even.

43:19.096 --> 43:22.265
- I know how you
like your licorice.

43:51.128 --> 43:52.996
Hey, Bob?

43:55.065 --> 43:58.301
The preacher gave a
good sermon today...

43:59.403 --> 44:00.937
on forgiveness.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.994
- All right, that's good.

44:30.034 --> 44:32.168
Here you go, boy.

44:40.344 --> 44:44.447
Most of us start work first
thing in the morning, Jake.

44:44.449 --> 44:45.982
Not last.

44:47.785 --> 44:50.019
- I'm sorry, Frank.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.655
- Just get to work.

45:07.504 --> 45:09.439
- Jakey!

45:09.441 --> 45:12.041
You ready for a big one tonight?

45:13.811 --> 45:16.679
- I'm working overtime tonight.

45:16.681 --> 45:20.783
- Come on, now.
Bang, bang, bang.

45:20.785 --> 45:23.019
Don't you love me no more?

45:23.021 --> 45:25.488
- Just got stuff
I gotta figure out.

45:25.490 --> 45:27.290
- What you
got to work out, Jake?

45:27.292 --> 45:31.127
What, another way to
smash on them horseshoe?

45:31.129 --> 45:35.164
Now, you ain't been much
of a team player lately.

45:35.166 --> 45:37.734
Seems like you've
got it in your head

45:37.736 --> 45:40.403
that you different somehow.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.905
You're just like us.

45:44.274 --> 45:46.809
- I ain't nothin' like you.

45:46.811 --> 45:48.010
- Fine.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.148
- I'm going over to Bob Collins.

45:52.150 --> 45:55.251
- No, no, no. See, you ain't.

45:56.053 --> 45:59.822
For one, Jake, you
ain't got the stones.

45:59.824 --> 46:01.023
Two...

46:01.625 --> 46:03.993
I'll just stop you.

46:03.995 --> 46:06.195
- You just try it.

46:16.374 --> 46:17.273
- Break it up!

46:17.275 --> 46:20.510
I said break it up!

46:25.983 --> 46:28.618
- Big boy thinks he can
throw punches around.

46:28.620 --> 46:31.320
- Shut your mouth, boy.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.926
You been drinking, Jake?

46:37.227 --> 46:40.863
Just go on home. You
know better than that.

46:40.865 --> 46:41.464
- I need the money, Frank.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.399
- If you need the
money, you won't come to work

46:43.401 --> 46:46.369
drinking tomorrow, now will you?

46:51.942 --> 46:53.810
You, and your brother,
and that so-called sheriff

46:53.812 --> 46:57.079
think you got this
town wrapped up.

46:57.081 --> 46:58.481
I can't speak for
everyone else around here

46:58.483 --> 47:02.018
because they're too
afraid to speak up.

47:02.020 --> 47:05.855
But, you boys are no good.

47:05.857 --> 47:08.424
- See ya around, hero.

47:09.693 --> 47:10.660
- You do know that,
in the State of Texas,

47:10.662 --> 47:14.397
if you trespass, that's
grounds for getting shot?

47:15.232 --> 47:18.201
I keep my rifle
loaded all day long.

47:18.203 --> 47:21.103
I see you coming
around here again,

47:21.105 --> 47:23.105
I just might mistake
you for a coyote

47:23.107 --> 47:24.974
trying to steal my chickens.

47:25.844 --> 47:28.511
You think that's funny?

47:29.012 --> 47:33.749
I guess we'll just have to
see what happens, won't we?

47:33.751 --> 47:36.285
Now get off my land.

47:38.856 --> 47:41.057
- Sure, hoss.

47:42.226 --> 47:44.560
Whatever you say.

48:01.045 --> 48:02.345
- Hello?

48:02.347 --> 48:03.412
- Hey, Carrie.

48:03.414 --> 48:04.747
- Hi, Frank, how are you?

48:04.749 --> 48:07.383
- Oh, I'm fine. It's just...

48:07.385 --> 48:10.486
Look, I had to send Jake home.

48:10.488 --> 48:12.622
I lost my temper a bit.

48:12.624 --> 48:17.093
He got in a scuffle with
one of the Cain brothers.

48:18.362 --> 48:21.130
Jake's been drinking again, too.

48:21.132 --> 48:22.899
- Oh.

48:23.834 --> 48:27.637
If you need anything,
I'll help if I can.

48:27.639 --> 48:30.640
- Okay. Thanks, Frank.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.239
- Where were you?

49:03.241 --> 49:04.840
- Work.

49:04.842 --> 49:06.108
- Got in a fight, huh?

49:06.110 --> 49:09.278
- Yeah, I got in a fight.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.681
- Frank called

49:11.683 --> 49:13.115
to check on you.

49:13.117 --> 49:16.285
The electricity was
turned off last night.

49:16.287 --> 49:18.187
- Well, I paid it.

49:18.189 --> 49:20.990
- Well, obviously you didn't!

49:22.693 --> 49:24.694
- Would you two stop yelling?

49:24.696 --> 49:28.030
- Don't talk to your
daddy like that, please.

49:29.299 --> 49:32.034
- I ain't got no daddy.

49:34.237 --> 49:37.440
Daddy, what is a daddy?!

49:37.442 --> 49:39.775
- You listen to your
mom, and you be quiet.

49:39.777 --> 49:41.210
- I don't wanna be quiet.

49:41.212 --> 49:43.245
All you do is yell and scream!

49:43.247 --> 49:47.216
Why can't I, huh?!

49:49.953 --> 49:53.990
- Get out! Get out!

49:53.992 --> 49:54.757
Get out!

49:54.759 --> 49:57.159
Leave! Get out of here!

49:57.161 --> 49:58.327
Get out of here!

49:58.329 --> 49:59.695
Goodbye.

49:59.697 --> 50:03.032
Puck. Puck.

50:03.367 --> 50:06.135
Puck! Puck!

50:06.436 --> 50:07.670
Puck!

50:08.005 --> 50:10.973
Puck! Puck!

50:12.743 --> 50:15.878
Puck!

50:19.916 --> 50:21.617
- Ooh! Ah!

50:21.619 --> 50:23.619
That blanket is stinky!

50:23.621 --> 50:28.290
My, I can't see how you can
stand to lay on that thing.

50:28.292 --> 50:28.591
Well...

50:28.593 --> 50:32.361
gonna get a wash today, 'cause
I can't stand it anymore.

50:32.363 --> 50:36.665
That is disgusting! My!

50:40.337 --> 50:44.140
All right. There we go.

50:44.508 --> 50:46.042
All right, now.

50:46.044 --> 50:47.309
No! No, no, no!

50:47.311 --> 50:49.111
Shep, come on now!

50:49.113 --> 50:49.812
Come on, move!

50:49.814 --> 50:51.313
No, let it...

50:51.315 --> 50:52.275
Shep! Let it go.

50:53.451 --> 50:57.386
Let it go! Shep,
will you let it go?!

50:57.388 --> 50:59.622
Just take it. Take it!

50:59.624 --> 51:01.057
Take it!

51:02.492 --> 51:03.859
- Puck?

51:03.861 --> 51:05.094
Puck, it's me, Bay.

51:05.096 --> 51:06.328
- Just leave me alone.

51:06.330 --> 51:07.763
- What's the matter?

51:07.765 --> 51:10.566
- Nothing, I'm fine.

51:10.867 --> 51:14.236
- No, you're not, or
you wouldn't be crying.

51:14.238 --> 51:16.505
- I ain't crying.

51:17.174 --> 51:19.708
- Look at me, Puck.

51:21.545 --> 51:22.812
What happened?!

51:22.814 --> 51:25.581
- I busted my lip on a rock.

51:26.216 --> 51:29.118
- Somebody hit you, didn't they?

51:31.822 --> 51:33.656
- My daddy hit me.

51:33.658 --> 51:36.859
He was all drunk, so
I guess it's okay.

51:36.861 --> 51:40.229
He don't smack me
when he ain't drunk.

51:41.965 --> 51:43.799
- He shouldn't be
hitting you, Puck.

51:43.801 --> 51:48.270
Drinking or not, that
just isn't right.

51:48.272 --> 51:50.539
- That's just Jake.

51:52.909 --> 51:55.211
- You have to tell
someone, Puck.

51:55.213 --> 51:56.912
- Who am I going to tell?

51:56.914 --> 52:00.149
Besides, ain't no
one to listen anyway.

52:00.151 --> 52:02.418
- How about telling my dad?

52:02.420 --> 52:05.654
He'll listen to you, Puck.

52:06.356 --> 52:08.457
- I'll be okay.

52:10.293 --> 52:11.794
- Come on.

52:13.497 --> 52:14.530
Come on, Puck.

52:14.532 --> 52:16.432
- Mm-mmm.

52:16.600 --> 52:19.101
- Come on.

52:19.569 --> 52:21.704
Come on.

52:32.115 --> 52:33.182
- Hey, son.

52:33.184 --> 52:34.550
- Hey, Dad.

52:34.651 --> 52:37.019
- Hey, grab a seat. Move that
stuff outta the way there.

52:37.021 --> 52:40.556
- Okay, Dad.
- Be right with you.

52:42.392 --> 52:44.026
- What's going on, son?

52:44.028 --> 52:46.529
- Dad, this is my
new friend, Puck.

52:46.531 --> 52:48.497
She got hurt.

52:49.132 --> 52:51.600
- Ah, you got hurt?

52:53.470 --> 52:55.437
Let me see.

52:55.539 --> 52:57.373
Well, well, well.

52:57.375 --> 53:00.442
You know, I think I
have just the thing

53:00.444 --> 53:03.078
that'll fix you right up.

53:03.080 --> 53:07.716
I told you he was nice.

53:09.753 --> 53:12.254
- Fresh strawberries.

53:12.956 --> 53:16.492
Go ahead. Take one.

53:20.230 --> 53:22.631
Tell me what you think.

53:23.066 --> 53:23.799
- Yeah?
- - I'll take one.

53:23.801 --> 53:27.036
- I know you will take one.

53:27.038 --> 53:27.970
- Thank you.

53:27.972 --> 53:29.872
- You're very welcome.

53:29.874 --> 53:31.707
Ah, there's that smile.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.842
- Well, we'll be going, Papa.

53:33.844 --> 53:35.477
- All right.

53:35.479 --> 53:36.712
Where you off to?

53:36.714 --> 53:37.913
- Fishing.

53:37.915 --> 53:39.915
- Of course. Fishing.

53:39.917 --> 53:41.684
Come here, you.

53:41.686 --> 53:42.785
- Come on, Puck.

53:42.787 --> 53:45.521
- Hey, Puck.
- - Yeah?

53:45.523 --> 53:49.124
- Why don't you
take these with you?

53:49.126 --> 53:50.492
- Thank you.

53:50.494 --> 53:52.361
- Ooh, yeah. More strawberries.

53:52.363 --> 53:55.397
- Give some to
your mom! I love you, son.

53:55.399 --> 53:57.099
- Love you, too, Dad.

53:57.101 --> 54:00.402
- Bye.

54:03.006 --> 54:04.840
- Well, Mr. Billy,

54:04.842 --> 54:09.545
another satisfied customer.

54:18.021 --> 54:19.855
- There he goes.

54:30.367 --> 54:32.468
- Where we going, Snake?

54:32.470 --> 54:34.937
- Come on, Jake.

54:49.452 --> 54:51.253
- All right, Snake.

54:51.255 --> 54:52.588
Comin' up on me.

55:02.532 --> 55:04.700
- There you go, Jake.

55:04.702 --> 55:07.036
We just gonna play a
little game of chicken.

55:11.541 --> 55:14.443
- Come on, Snake! Floor it!

55:15.646 --> 55:17.546
Cut him off!

55:19.416 --> 55:20.749
Yes!

55:23.053 --> 55:25.721
- We gonna circle around.

56:06.896 --> 56:08.764
- Jakey!

56:09.065 --> 56:12.468
How about that brotherhood now?

56:13.069 --> 56:15.404
- Ain't no brotherhood...

56:15.705 --> 56:19.708
with you or your
crazy, law man uncle.

56:27.951 --> 56:28.550
What?

56:28.552 --> 56:30.619
You think 'cause you got a job,

56:30.621 --> 56:32.855
and you earn a paycheck,

56:32.857 --> 56:35.424
you're some kind of role model?

56:35.426 --> 56:37.626
You're a liar, Joe.

56:37.628 --> 56:41.463
A 10-star-wearin' liar.

56:41.998 --> 56:43.999
You know what they did.

56:44.001 --> 56:45.868
Covering it up like
a hole in a wall.

56:45.870 --> 56:50.139
- Now, don't you be talking
to my family like that, boy.

56:50.141 --> 56:54.176
- I know what's
behind that wall.

56:54.178 --> 56:56.712
Them cries from them kids.

56:56.714 --> 56:59.515
That poor man's wife.

56:59.616 --> 57:02.651
They didn't do nothing to you.

57:05.221 --> 57:08.524
Them cries are coming to get ya,

57:09.125 --> 57:11.126
all three of you.

57:13.229 --> 57:15.097
You just wait.

57:19.402 --> 57:22.771
- Why don't you
boys hit the road?

57:26.609 --> 57:28.410
Beat it!

57:53.069 --> 57:55.170
You know something, Jake?

57:56.039 --> 57:58.407
I could come up with about
a dozen legal reasons

57:58.409 --> 58:01.910
to put a bullet through
your head right now.

58:08.885 --> 58:11.787
But, lucky for me,

58:11.789 --> 58:14.089
I only need one.

58:19.696 --> 58:21.063
- Sheriff?

58:21.065 --> 58:23.065
Everything all right?

58:24.334 --> 58:26.034
- Just fine.

58:32.542 --> 58:34.810
Get this cleaned up.

58:43.319 --> 58:45.687
- Tell you what, you
be sure and tell your mom

58:45.689 --> 58:48.156
I said hello, and have her
stop by the shop, okay?

58:48.158 --> 58:50.192
- Okay.
- James? You do the...

58:50.194 --> 58:51.994
- Ow!

58:51.996 --> 58:54.129
You do the same. Tell
your dad I said hi.

58:54.131 --> 58:56.098
- Okay.
- - Bye-bye, now.

58:56.100 --> 58:58.133
- Can we go get some ice cream?

58:58.135 --> 58:59.101
- What you doing, Carl?

58:59.103 --> 59:01.436
- Hey, Seth.
How you doing, bro?

59:01.438 --> 59:03.539
- Licorice?
- - For me?

59:03.541 --> 59:04.373
- Hell yeah.

59:04.375 --> 59:06.742
- Licorice. Don't mind if I do.

59:09.512 --> 59:10.212
Thanks, bro.

59:10.214 --> 59:11.580
- Come on by tonight, Carl.

59:11.582 --> 59:14.750
Your sister's cooking
your favorite.

59:37.040 --> 59:41.143
- I remember a picture
on this wall, right here,

59:41.145 --> 59:44.780
of me and my daddy
holding a big, old fish.

59:47.350 --> 59:49.217
Right over here,

59:49.219 --> 59:53.021
was a picture of my daddy
winning the gun show.

59:53.023 --> 59:55.791
Good times, huh?

59:59.862 --> 01:00:04.099
I believe I'll have me some
of this black licorice.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:08.870
One of them carvings, too.

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:15.277
Who makes these anyway?

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:19.081
- My brother, Bob.

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:23.585
- Didn't know you had a brother.

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:27.789
- Yeah, you did.

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:31.893
You murdered his
wife and two kids.

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:35.964
That'll be $4.78.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:12.734
- Thanks for the licorice.

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.179
- Sheriff.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:27.349
I can't have your little
nephews come into my store

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:28.417
and stealing from me.

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:31.319
- Who? Snake and Matty?

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:31.853
They ain't no harm.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.822
- You mean like the
no harm they did

01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:37.025
to my brother and his family?

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:39.795
- Oh.

01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:41.263
The accident.

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:44.766
- We ain't calling
that no accident.

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:50.472
- Well, seems to me

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:52.974
you're gonna have to.

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:55.610
Now, that happened months ago.

01:01:55.612 --> 01:01:59.381
People have left
alone what should be.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:02.551
If you wanna go starting
that all up again,

01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:04.786
you be my guest.

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:07.622
But, you know those boys.

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:09.925
You start something,

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:12.594
I might have to
look the other way.

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:13.995
- Yeah.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:17.065
You're real good at that,
aren't you, Sheriff?

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:20.969
- You got a
real nice store there.

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:23.071
Nice families.

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.376
You 'bout done here, boys,

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:32.748
'cause I'm getting hungry.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.450
- Me too.

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:53.502
- Mr. Knight,
you're gonna be fine, sir.

01:02:53.504 --> 01:02:58.273
You've been transported to
USMD Hospital at Arlington.

01:02:58.275 --> 01:02:59.574
You were in a car accident,

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:02.410
and you hit your
head pretty hard.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:03.478
Just try to relax.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.649
Let me go get some pain
medicine and some ice chips.

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:09.951
- Thank you.

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:47.589
- Some pretty nice strawberries

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:49.958
in the kitchen there.

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:57.232
Honey, I'm so sorry.

01:03:57.867 --> 01:04:00.302
I love you so much.

01:04:00.304 --> 01:04:03.271
- I know, Mom. I love you, too.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:05.507
- Your daddy,
he loves you, too.

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:07.742
He's just having a hard time.

01:04:07.744 --> 01:04:09.044
- It's okay.

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:12.681
My new friend, Bay, took
me to see his dad's store.

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:14.449
He has everything in there.

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:18.286
That's where I got
strawberries from.

01:04:18.288 --> 01:04:20.856
He said we could
come by any time.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:24.159
- I think
that'd be a great idea.

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.862
We're gonna be okay.

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:28.263
Okay?

01:04:32.002 --> 01:04:34.402
Hold on, I'll be right back.

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:41.376
Hello?

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.011
- Carrie, it's Frank.

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:44.913
- Hi, Frank.

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:47.215
- Jake's been in a car accident.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:48.483
- Where is he?

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:49.885
- USMD.

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:52.888
- Okay, I'll be right there.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.424
Puck, we've gotta go.

01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:58.793
Barry! Where is your brother?

01:04:58.795 --> 01:05:01.096
Puck, go put on a clean shirt.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:04.399
- Paging Dr.
Porter. Paging Dr. Porter.

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:08.270
Dr. Porter, please
pick up a red phone.

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.341
- Frank.

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:15.377
- Hey.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.245
It's okay. He's okay.

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:21.016
Your dad's okay. He
had his seatbelt on.

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:22.951
- I was so upset.

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:26.187
He was so angry.

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:26.922
- I know.

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:31.126
Jake hasn't been himself
for some time now.

01:05:31.128 --> 01:05:32.661
To be honest,

01:05:32.663 --> 01:05:34.296
I've almost had to fire him,

01:05:34.298 --> 01:05:35.063
more than once.

01:05:35.065 --> 01:05:36.698
Don't worry, his job is safe.

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.868
When he's straight, he's the
best worker I've ever had.

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:43.305
But, something is
eating him up inside.

01:05:43.307 --> 01:05:46.508
If we don't help him beat
whatever demons he's fighting,

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.544
it's just gonna get worse.

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:50.979
- Miss Carrie.
- - Yeah.

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:53.815
- Your husband's gonna be okay.

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:55.984
- I'll stay here.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:13.101
- I'm sorry, baby.

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:19.941
I love you.

01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:22.477
- I love you, too.

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:47.702
- Okay.
- We'll be all right.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.108
- Here you go, Therese.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.376
- Thanks.

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:57.212
- Hey, Ruby.
How's Jake Knight doing?

01:06:57.214 --> 01:06:57.979
- He's in some pain,

01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:00.749
but I'm ordering him
some pain medicine.

01:07:00.751 --> 01:07:01.649
- Okay, good.

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:03.451
It could've been a lot worse.

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:06.254
Must have a guardian
angel, that's for sure.

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:07.756
- Yes sir, Doc.

01:07:07.758 --> 01:07:08.623
- I'll be in Room 3.

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:11.026
- Thank you, Doctor.

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:15.930
- Hey, Frank.

01:07:15.932 --> 01:07:18.066
- How's it going?

01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:20.101
- Oh, you know.

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.104
Is Carrie here?

01:07:23.106 --> 01:07:25.373
- She went to get coffee.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:28.576
Told her I'd hold down
the fort for a while.

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:30.245
But, you know what?
I don't do bed pans.

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:32.814
- Oh, man.

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:37.018
I sure could go for one
of your greasy hamburgers.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.021
Spicy ketchup, mustard.

01:07:40.023 --> 01:07:42.690
- Ask, and you shall receive.

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:46.428
- Seek, and you shall find.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:49.731
- Knock, and the
door shall be opened.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:53.201
- Look at you. I didn't know
you knew any Bible verses.

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:56.638
- Yeah, well, Pops.

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:03.044
- Hey. Don't tell Miss Ruby.

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:07.449
- We'll get you
back on your feet.

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:09.951
There's a little
something extra in there

01:08:09.953 --> 01:08:11.853
to help you out.

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:17.591
- I can't take this.

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:21.095
- It'll help out,

01:08:21.098 --> 01:08:25.700
but it's not gonna
fix your problem.

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:31.206
- Yeah, well thanks
for the hamburger.

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:35.743
- I am not gonna let
you off that easy, Jake.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:39.314
There are people
who care about you.

01:08:39.316 --> 01:08:41.916
They worry about what
you're doing to your life.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:45.752
They wanna help you, and
you can't even see that.

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:49.023
You're walking
down Gallows Road.

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:52.260
I know, 'cause I've
been there myself.

01:08:53.761 --> 01:08:56.264
It's a dark road, son.

01:08:56.999 --> 01:09:00.768
It's like you're blindfolded.

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.938
When you get to the
end of that road,

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:08.710
there's these wooden
steps you have to go up.

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:10.845
It's like you're in quicksand.

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:14.749
You're just sinking
deeper and deeper.

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:17.752
When you get to the
top, there's a scaffold

01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:19.953
with a rope hanging on it.

01:09:19.956 --> 01:09:22.256
The rope makes this...

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:23.992
high-pitched screeching sound

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:29.296
as that knot digs into
the side of your neck.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.502
Just like that, your
feet are free of land.

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:38.573
Snap.

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:40.742
You break.

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:46.214
The most important thing about
Gallows Road, Jake, is this.

01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:49.283
That blindfold that
you're wearing,

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:52.153
you put it there yourself.

01:09:53.221 --> 01:09:55.089
You can't be pointing fingers

01:09:55.091 --> 01:10:00.261
and blaming everyone
else for your problems.

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:03.598
You wanna make your life better?

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.033
Then, do it.

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:06.801
Get off that road.

01:10:06.803 --> 01:10:10.004
You can turn back
any time you want.

01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:13.908
But, you're the one that's
gotta take that first step.

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.785
- I was there.

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.455
I just stood and watched.

01:10:27.457 --> 01:10:29.390
- Watched what?

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:33.061
- Matty Cain threw
a flaming torch

01:10:33.063 --> 01:10:35.763
at Bob Collin's porch.

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.833
I tried to help 'em,

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:41.302
but Snake put a gun to my chest.

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:43.271
- That was an accident,

01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:44.672
so they say.

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.274
- Yeah.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.743
So they say.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.378
- Yeah.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.215
- What's worse
than a man dying...

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.653
is not being able to live.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:03.157
I'm a coward, Frank.

01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:05.460
- You're not a coward.

01:11:05.462 --> 01:11:09.130
You made a mistake. Fix it.

01:11:09.132 --> 01:11:10.932
- I ain't worth fixing.

01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:12.500
I'm already gone.

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:14.002
- Nobody gone.

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:16.170
You're off course, that's all.

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:19.140
- I can't sleep. I can't work.

01:11:19.142 --> 01:11:22.877
I can't get through a
day without drinking.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.315
I keep seeing them two kids,

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:30.251
and that man's poor wife.

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:34.722
My kids, they don't know me.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:40.695
And my wife, she's afraid of me.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:47.635
I wish I could take
that night back, Frank,

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:49.370
but I can't.

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.839
- There ain't no sin...

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:55.910
greater than God's
forgiveness, Jake.

01:11:55.912 --> 01:11:58.279
- Forgiveness?

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:02.016
So, God's gonna forgive me,

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:04.018
just like that?

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:06.788
- Yeah.

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:09.357
Just like that.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.562
Says so right here
in the Good Book.

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:20.702
You know how you get it?

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.705
- How?

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:26.341
- You just ask.

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.625
- Hey, Shep.

01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:46.194
Come on now.

01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:49.330
Hey, boy, I got your favorite.

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:52.800
Here. Here you go, Shep.

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:54.869
Shep?

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:57.338
Shep?

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:00.641
Shep, come on now.

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:03.611
Here, it's your favorite.

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:09.984
Shep. Come on, Shep.

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:12.887
Come on, Shep.

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:16.691
Don't you die on me, too.

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:18.926
Aw, Shep.

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:22.864
Shep.

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:09.203
- Bay came to see me.

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:12.840
- He found you, huh?

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:15.710
- Yeah, he found me.

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:18.546
He's a good boy.

01:15:18.548 --> 01:15:21.482
You all doing a
good job with him.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:25.219
He gettin' tall.

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:29.323
Maybe gonna be as
big as his daddy.

01:15:29.325 --> 01:15:31.392
- So, what you saying?

01:15:31.394 --> 01:15:33.728
- Just saying.

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:42.937
- I'm real sorry, Bob.

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:45.540
- Know what I remember?

01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:49.210
It was really hot that night.

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:54.582
I can still smell the flowers.

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:59.620
My wife was looking nice.

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:03.524
Mary and Michael...

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.795
Those kids...

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:11.632
were the sunshine of my life.

01:16:11.634 --> 01:16:13.701
- I know.

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.903
We all miss 'em.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:19.407
Life just isn't fair.

01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:22.944
- You don't know.

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.915
But, you're right.

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:32.787
Life just isn't fair.

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:36.791
- Bobby, you ever think
about forgiving that boy?

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:38.459
- What boy?

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:39.327
- Jake.

01:16:39.329 --> 01:16:42.797
He got a little girl, young.

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:45.299
You ever think about
the pain and the guilt

01:16:45.301 --> 01:16:46.834
that he has to live with?

01:16:46.836 --> 01:16:50.938
- You ever think about what
I have to live without?

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:54.709
I lost...

01:16:57.346 --> 01:16:59.313
my two kids.

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:02.917
My wife.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.855
What about my kids?

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.893
They should be out playing.

01:17:12.895 --> 01:17:14.895
Me and the kids.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.167
What about my wife?

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:26.641
Who I got to come home to?

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:38.119
- You...

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.488
You could go back
off in them woods

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:44.325
and hide in your cave,
your safe place...

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:49.196
like I did when Dad died.

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:56.537
Or you can put God here,

01:17:56.539 --> 01:17:58.305
right here.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.877
'Cause when you got God,
you're safe anywhere.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.747
Now, I know I can't
make you do nothing

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:09.650
that you don't wanna do.

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:13.954
But, you gotta keep
moving, big brother.

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:21.696
You walked out on me, Bobby.

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:26.567
You walked out on me

01:18:26.569 --> 01:18:28.936
and this store.

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:30.538
Our store.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:33.407
You runnin' and hidin'
off in them woods.

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:36.777
You ain't doing nobody no good.

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:41.148
You ain't got to run
and hide no more, Bobby.

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:43.617
You got friends and family

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:47.188
that love you and miss you.

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:50.925
I'm your only brother, Bobby.

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:55.396
I miss you.

01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:59.734
Please.

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.005
Please...

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:07.541
come to church
with me this Sunday

01:19:07.543 --> 01:19:10.945
just like old times.

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:17.585
- That what you
think I been doing?

01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:19.253
Hiding?

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:25.359
You ain't got to go to
no church to talk to God.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:29.897
I been talking to God.

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:35.002
I made me some decision.

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:40.007
I'm gonna kill them boy.

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:43.110
All three of 'em.

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:56.023
Thanks for the licorice.

01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:43.204
- Hello?

01:20:44.739 --> 01:20:46.040
Hello?

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:48.876
- Jessie.

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.512
- Seth?
- - Yes.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:54.014
- It's me, honey.

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:56.650
- Baby, you okay?

01:20:56.652 --> 01:20:59.420
- I'm okay.

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:04.291
I just called to
tell you I love you.

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:06.460
- Bay, go to your room.

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:11.365
What's wrong?

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.834
- It's Bob.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.172
- What do you mean?

01:21:18.174 --> 01:21:21.408
- He knows they coming for him.

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:23.143
He's gonna kill 'em, Jessie.

01:21:23.145 --> 01:21:26.380
- Baby?
- - I gotta go.

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:30.284
- Where are you going?

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:33.053
Seth.

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:42.162
Bay!

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:15.829
- I'm gonna smoke
that man out like a rat,

01:22:15.831 --> 01:22:17.765
finish what we started.

01:22:17.767 --> 01:22:21.068
- And you're
sure you wanna do this?

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:26.140
- I never been more.

01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:45.292
- Forgive me, God.

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:56.103
- One, two, three, four.

01:22:56.105 --> 01:22:56.770
- Okay!

01:22:56.772 --> 01:22:58.539
- Now, we're even.
- Killed ya.

01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:00.407
- Let's play again.

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:11.018
- Jake Knight's room, please?

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:14.188
Jake?

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:16.423
Someone's been here.

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:17.992
- Where?

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:19.626
- Our house.

01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:22.029
I was taking the trash out,

01:23:22.031 --> 01:23:24.665
- and I...
- Carrie?

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:26.200
- I'm coming home.

01:23:26.202 --> 01:23:28.035
- Jake?

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:38.145
- Okay, good. Ms. Combs
seems to be doing better.

01:23:38.147 --> 01:23:38.946
Vitals are good.

01:23:38.948 --> 01:23:40.581
Let's go ahead and
take her off Demerol,

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:42.149
switch her to Tylenol.

01:23:42.151 --> 01:23:42.850
- Okay.

01:23:42.852 --> 01:23:45.352
- Mr. Knights. Okay, good.

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:47.354
His x-ray, CT came
back negative.

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.523
Still wanna monitor
him one more day.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:52.259
If he's tolerating liquids,
just remove his IV.

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:52.960
- Yes, sir.

01:23:52.962 --> 01:23:54.395
- Hello, this is Frank.

01:23:54.397 --> 01:23:55.763
- Hey, Frank.

01:23:55.765 --> 01:23:56.897
I need to borrow
another work truck.

01:23:56.899 --> 01:23:58.899
- What're you
doing outta the hospital?

01:23:58.901 --> 01:23:59.767
You need your rest.

01:23:59.769 --> 01:24:00.734
- I can rest when this is over.

01:24:00.736 --> 01:24:02.236
- No, Jake. Listen to me.

01:24:02.238 --> 01:24:04.438
Jake. Jake, what're you doing?

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.305
- I gotta go.

01:24:05.307 --> 01:24:08.242
- Jake. Jake!

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:49.783
- Barry.
- - Dad?

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.953
- Are you okay?!

01:24:52.955 --> 01:24:54.588
- I'm okay.

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:56.290
Puck.

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:06.767
Show me what you saw.

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:20.447
Carrie, I want you
to listen to me.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:23.016
When I leave, I want you
to take Barry and Puck

01:25:23.018 --> 01:25:25.652
into the bedroom
and lock that door.

01:25:25.654 --> 01:25:26.553
- Okay.

01:25:26.555 --> 01:25:28.689
- I want you to
lock the front door,

01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:30.390
- and I'll be back soon.
- - Okay.

01:25:30.392 --> 01:25:32.759
- I'm afraid, Jake.

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:35.329
- Don't be.

01:25:35.331 --> 01:25:36.063
- Okay.

01:25:36.065 --> 01:25:38.332
- We're a family.

01:25:38.334 --> 01:25:40.601
You understand me?

01:25:40.603 --> 01:25:43.103
We're a family.

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:06.527
- Seth?

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.797
- Preacher Sam.

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:16.803
Can we talk?

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:19.139
- Sure.

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:24.344
- My brother come to me.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.183
He told me something
very unsettling.

01:26:30.418 --> 01:26:31.585
- Seth?

01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:35.889
- He said he gonna
kill them Cain boys,

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:36.957
and Jake, too.

01:26:36.959 --> 01:26:39.526
- He can't do that, Seth.

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:41.695
- Oh, he can.

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:44.531
And, he will.

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:46.667
He ain't got nothing
left to lose.

01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:50.337
- You go to the
person who wronged you,

01:26:50.339 --> 01:26:53.173
and forgive them.

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:58.879
- Preacher Sam, you and I
both know it ain't that easy.

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:03.317
They took his little boy.

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:06.920
They took his little girl.

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:11.291
And they took his wife.

01:27:13.127 --> 01:27:17.764
And I'm starting to
take it real personal.

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:22.302
- Seth, I'm here
for you, always.

01:27:22.304 --> 01:27:24.905
- But, if you was me...

01:27:27.308 --> 01:27:29.610
what would you do?

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:34.915
- I'd have to ask
you to pray for me.

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.781
- There he is, Carl!

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:13.720
You had me scared to death.

01:28:13.722 --> 01:28:15.188
Are you okay?

01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:17.557
- I'm sorry, Mama.

01:28:17.925 --> 01:28:19.526
- Come on. Take me to Bob.

01:28:19.528 --> 01:28:21.795
- Yes, ma'am.

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:33.006
- Forgive us our trespasses,

01:28:33.008 --> 01:28:37.144
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:40.414
But, lead us not
into temptation.

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:43.950
For thine is the kingdom,

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:46.920
the power,

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.957
and the glory.

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:54.528
Amen.

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:21.421
- Why don't you come
on out in the light, Bob?

01:29:21.423 --> 01:29:23.757
Where I can see you.

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:27.027
- You took my family, my blood!

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:27.928
Took 'em from me.

01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:29.763
- Come on now, Bob.

01:29:29.765 --> 01:29:33.834
You gonna sit there nice
and quiet, and burn.

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:39.239
Just like your
wife and kids did.

01:29:39.241 --> 01:29:40.507
- Gonna kill you, Snake,

01:29:40.509 --> 01:29:43.477
you and your brother there.

01:29:45.613 --> 01:29:50.617
You all ain't gonna do
no harm to nobody...

01:29:50.619 --> 01:29:52.352
no more.

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:01.962
- Why?

01:30:03.097 --> 01:30:05.399
- This ain't about no store.

01:30:05.401 --> 01:30:06.600
- You're right though.

01:30:06.602 --> 01:30:08.201
I just don't like you.

01:30:08.203 --> 01:30:10.303
I don't like your family.

01:30:10.305 --> 01:30:12.839
I don't like your kind.

01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:16.109
But, I tell you
what it is about.

01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:18.044
It's about the blood.

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:20.881
It's about the scavengers.

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:25.552
And it's about your
blood to spill.

01:30:25.554 --> 01:30:27.754
- You're pure hate.

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:30.390
May God forgive you.

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:34.227
- Never was no God in my world.

01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:35.896
- My God.

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:39.132
You're gonna wish there was.

01:30:39.134 --> 01:30:40.667
- This is my
battle, little brother.

01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:43.470
- It's our battle, bro.

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:51.077
- Put the gun down, Snake.

01:30:51.079 --> 01:30:53.980
- Two birds, one gun.

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:04.825
Matty.

01:31:04.827 --> 01:31:08.728
Put that gun on Bob's
little brother here.

01:31:08.730 --> 01:31:10.530
Matty!

01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:13.667
- Sheriff. 10-33.

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:18.205
We have three armed suspects
inside the old Aledo mill.

01:31:18.207 --> 01:31:19.172
They're in a standoff position,

01:31:19.174 --> 01:31:20.507
and they have their
weapons drawn.

01:31:20.509 --> 01:31:21.475
- Copy that.

01:31:21.477 --> 01:31:22.008
Hold the perimeter.

01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:24.978
Do not make a move until I
get there. I'm on my way.

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:27.380
- David 927, I'll be en route.

01:31:27.382 --> 01:31:28.281
- Sheriff.

01:31:28.283 --> 01:31:31.184
Snake, Matty, and Jake...

01:31:31.186 --> 01:31:32.853
They're in there
with Bob Collins.

01:31:32.855 --> 01:31:36.156
- I heard you the first
time, Gibby. Do not move!

01:31:36.158 --> 01:31:39.025
I'm on my way. Confirmed.

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:41.962
Gibby.

01:31:42.763 --> 01:31:43.663
Gibby!

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:58.011
- Who's this?

01:31:58.013 --> 01:31:59.746
- My husband is
in there, isn't he, Carl?

01:31:59.748 --> 01:32:00.780
- Jessie, stay in.
- You tell me.

01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:01.615
- He's in there, isn't he?

01:32:01.617 --> 01:32:03.550
- I don't know...
- No, no, no!

01:32:03.552 --> 01:32:04.284
- Jessie!

01:32:04.286 --> 01:32:06.620
Your husband is inside.
Weapons are drawn.

01:32:06.622 --> 01:32:08.588
I need you to stay calm.

01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:09.422
- Uncle Bob!

01:32:09.424 --> 01:32:11.658
- Bay? Where's Bay?!

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:12.826
- Papa!
- - Bay!

01:32:12.828 --> 01:32:14.227
- Bay! Go on
and get outta here!

01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:15.562
- No, Papa! Don't do this!

01:32:15.564 --> 01:32:17.497
- Run! Get outta here now!

01:32:17.499 --> 01:32:18.331
- No, Papa.

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:19.432
Not without you or Uncle Bob.

01:32:19.434 --> 01:32:21.768
- Let me go!

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:25.071
If something happens
to my husband or child,

01:32:25.073 --> 01:32:26.907
I'll come after you myself.

01:32:26.909 --> 01:32:30.043
You will feel from a
woman like you have never!

01:32:30.045 --> 01:32:32.345
- Don't you
have a mama or papa?

01:32:32.347 --> 01:32:36.516
I know if you did,
they would miss you.

01:32:36.518 --> 01:32:37.751
Forgive.

01:32:37.753 --> 01:32:39.986
I forgive you!

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:43.957
- Snake?

01:32:46.328 --> 01:32:48.662
- No!

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:05.645
- Put your weapons down!

01:33:05.647 --> 01:33:06.580
- Are you okay?

01:33:06.582 --> 01:33:08.982
- On the ground now!

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:11.384
Hands above you head!

01:33:11.386 --> 01:33:13.820
Do it now! Do it now!

01:33:13.822 --> 01:33:15.555
Snake?

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:22.896
- I got one in custody.

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:26.967
- Please. Please, Bob.

01:33:26.969 --> 01:33:29.202
Please forgive me.

01:33:29.204 --> 01:33:31.838
- I already have, son.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.222
- Snake, don't
leave me, brother.

01:33:49.224 --> 01:33:51.925
I don't want to
be the last wolf.

01:33:51.927 --> 01:33:52.826
- Start
medical, we got one here

01:33:52.828 --> 01:33:55.762
with a gunshot wound,
left chest, one down.

01:33:55.764 --> 01:33:56.930
Stay with me, man. Stay with me.

01:33:56.932 --> 01:34:00.000
Tell 'em to step it up.
We need 'em code out here.

01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:03.336
Talk to me. Come on, talk to me.

01:34:03.338 --> 01:34:06.006
Come on. Stay with me.

01:34:37.538 --> 01:34:39.239
- Hey, Bob.

01:34:41.475 --> 01:34:43.143
- Hey, Seth.

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:47.113
- You ready to do this?

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:50.216
- I guess so.

01:34:51.285 --> 01:34:54.454
- Let's get going then.

01:34:54.456 --> 01:34:55.989
Hey, kids!

01:34:55.991 --> 01:34:58.725
Your Uncle Bob is here.

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:01.561
- Hey.
- - Hey.

01:35:01.563 --> 01:35:03.930
- Bay. Hi, Maji.

01:35:03.932 --> 01:35:05.699
- Hey, Bob!

01:35:06.333 --> 01:35:07.934
- Hi, Jessie.

01:35:07.936 --> 01:35:09.569
- Today is a good day.

01:35:09.571 --> 01:35:11.905
- It is, Jessie.

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:16.042
- Why don't you all go on ahead,

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:17.610
and give us a moment.

01:35:17.612 --> 01:35:19.612
- Sure. Come on, kids.

01:35:19.614 --> 01:35:24.084
Let's go. We'll
leave you two alone.

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:31.491
- I just...

01:35:31.493 --> 01:35:35.895
need a few moments
to catch my breath.

01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:40.800
I don't know if I can do this.

01:35:40.802 --> 01:35:42.168
- Bob.

01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:45.705
Yes, you can.

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:49.876
Look, I...

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:52.979
I was saving this

01:35:52.981 --> 01:35:55.915
for just the right moment.

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:05.325
Little welcome-back
gift from the family.

01:36:05.327 --> 01:36:09.028
You know you can't
ignore God, Bob.

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:12.031
- Yeah, that is...

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:15.368
hard to do.

01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:32.018
- See ya there?

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.753
- Oh, yeah.

01:36:33.755 --> 01:36:35.221
I'll be there.

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:35.582
- Today is a very important day

01:37:35.584 --> 01:37:37.350
in our community.

01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:40.587
We welcome back a member.

01:37:40.589 --> 01:37:41.588
Bob Collins.

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:49.896
When you hear the
word community,

01:37:49.898 --> 01:37:53.132
oftentimes you think
of it as small.

01:37:53.134 --> 01:37:55.468
But, we're not small here.

01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:57.770
We have big hearts,

01:37:57.772 --> 01:37:59.505
big dreams,

01:37:59.507 --> 01:38:00.840
hard-working people

01:38:00.842 --> 01:38:05.612
all working together to improve
the lives of our families.

01:38:05.614 --> 01:38:09.115
In a city, whether
small or large,

01:38:09.117 --> 01:38:11.651
there's a common thread.

01:38:11.653 --> 01:38:13.953
Together, we struggle.

01:38:13.955 --> 01:38:16.256
And together, we love.

01:38:16.258 --> 01:38:20.293
So together, today,

01:38:20.295 --> 01:38:22.528
please join us

01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:25.632
in celebrating the opening

01:38:25.634 --> 01:38:28.868
of the Collins
brothers' antique store.

01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:31.271
Bob, would you do the favor?

01:38:31.273 --> 01:38:33.473
- I'd be honored.

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:40.647
All right.

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:10.410
- You did good, Jake.

01:39:10.412 --> 01:39:13.146
- Thanks for not
giving up on me, Frank.

01:39:13.148 --> 01:39:16.015
- I'm proud of you,
and so is your family.

01:39:16.017 --> 01:39:18.117
You did the right thing.

01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:19.919
- Well, I'm staying here.

01:39:19.921 --> 01:39:21.821
I'm not going anywhere.

01:39:21.823 --> 01:39:23.589
With my family.

01:39:23.591 --> 01:39:24.724
- I wanna go in
the antique store

01:39:24.726 --> 01:39:27.360
- right now.
- - All right, let's go.

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:33.266
- Hey, what
about that bird call?

01:39:33.268 --> 01:39:35.168
You were gonna teach me.

01:39:35.170 --> 01:39:38.171
- Try this.

01:39:38.173 --> 01:39:39.672
- My turn.

01:39:41.743 --> 01:39:43.576
- We need to work on that.

01:39:43.578 --> 01:39:46.846
- Okay, so my bird
call doesn't impress you,

01:39:46.848 --> 01:39:50.049
but how about?

01:39:50.051 --> 01:39:52.085
Here we go.
