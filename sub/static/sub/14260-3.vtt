Aw, come on, Leonardo.

01:05.098 --> 01:06.832
There must be something
we can wear

01:06.834 --> 01:08.766
to the Channel 6
Halloween party.

01:08.768 --> 01:10.936
Yeah, disguise-meisters
like us

01:10.938 --> 01:12.604
should be
the hit of the party.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.407
And maybe cop first prize
in the costume contest.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.243
No, the idea is
to not draw attention.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.377
How's this?

01:19.379 --> 01:22.080
Excuse me, haven't we
overdone this one?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.449
Well, what about this?

01:26.151 --> 01:28.185
[all]
Too common these days.

01:28.187 --> 01:31.188
Ah, well, that's
the selection, fellas.

01:31.190 --> 01:34.459
Aw, looks like we can't
go to that Halloween ball.

01:34.461 --> 01:38.329
Well, dudes, there
goes our reputation
as party animals.

01:38.331 --> 01:39.664
[Splinter]
Ahem.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.733
If I may make
a suggestion,

01:41.735 --> 01:45.169
why not go disguised
as yourselves?

01:45.171 --> 01:46.370
Go to the party

01:46.372 --> 01:49.207
as the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles?

01:49.209 --> 01:50.909
Sensei,
that's brilliant!

01:50.911 --> 01:52.911
Righteous notion, dude!

01:52.913 --> 01:55.346
After all,
who looks more like us

01:55.348 --> 01:56.915
than us?

01:56.917 --> 02:00.351
[Man]
This prototype
reverse polarity magnet

02:00.353 --> 02:02.587
will eventually
become the heart

02:02.589 --> 02:06.824
of our new super
conductive railway system,
Miss O'Neil.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.727
And how exactly
does it work?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.729
Unlike conventional
magnets,

02:10.731 --> 02:12.697
which attract metal objects,

02:12.699 --> 02:15.133
the reverse polarity magnet

02:15.135 --> 02:18.737
can repel and suspend
objects in mid-air.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.606
Observe that anvil.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.909
See? The anti-magnet
is strong enough to lift

02:24.911 --> 02:28.647
even the heaviest
of metal objects.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.582
[machine turns off]
[clank]

02:30.584 --> 02:32.817
That's really
incredible, Professor.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.087
Yes, the anti-magnet
will save energy,

02:36.089 --> 02:37.521
reduce pollution,

02:37.523 --> 02:41.225
ushering in the new era
of progress and pros--

02:41.227 --> 02:43.194
[sobbing]
prosperity.

02:43.196 --> 02:44.796
April O'Neil signing off

02:44.798 --> 02:46.764
with a scientist
of great genius

02:46.766 --> 02:48.365
and even greater emotion.

02:48.367 --> 02:50.268
[whimpering]
What great emotion?

02:50.270 --> 02:53.104
Get that anvil off my foot!

02:53.106 --> 02:56.474
Oh, here, here--
we'll help you.

02:56.476 --> 02:57.809
Oh!

02:57.811 --> 03:00.645
[crash]

03:00.647 --> 03:03.047
Oh, yuck!

03:03.049 --> 03:04.882
Irma,
are you all right?

03:04.884 --> 03:08.453
P.U. What is this stuff?
It smells awful.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.888
Just some chemicals.
I assure you,

03:10.890 --> 03:12.457
they're
perfectly harmless.

03:12.459 --> 03:15.193
But what if they turn me
into some sort of mutant?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.160
Like Bug-man,

03:16.162 --> 03:18.362
or the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles?

03:18.364 --> 03:19.864
[laughing]
Oh, you have
my word,

03:19.866 --> 03:21.733
that's completely
impossible.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.869
Oh, oh.
I feel dizzy.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.170
I'll drive you home,
Irma.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.939
Uh, never mind,

03:27.941 --> 03:31.208
I can stagger there
from here.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.949
<i>See? The anti-magnet</i>
<i>is strong enough to lift</i>

03:37.951 --> 03:41.385
<i>any metal object,</i>
<i>up to 3 tons.</i>

03:41.387 --> 03:43.354
Incredible.

03:43.356 --> 03:47.592
That anti-magnet
is just the thing we need
to rule the world.

03:47.594 --> 03:50.361
Have you taken leave
of your senses, Krang?

03:50.363 --> 03:53.497
How can we rule the world
with a reverse polarity magnet?

03:53.499 --> 03:56.500
Don't you see?
By attaching it

03:56.502 --> 04:00.104
to the amplifying antenna
on top of the Technodrome,

04:00.106 --> 04:03.541
we can increase its power
a hundredfold.

04:03.543 --> 04:06.110
We'll be able
to lift anything:

04:06.112 --> 04:09.346
aircraft, ships,
entire buildings!

04:09.348 --> 04:14.084
We'll bring the world
to its knees.

04:14.086 --> 04:17.221
When you're right,
you're right.

04:17.223 --> 04:21.257
Uh, how come this costume
doesn't fit right?

04:21.260 --> 04:22.994
I worked on it for weeks.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.697
Maybe this chemical's
caused me to lose weight.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.164
I wish.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.333
[sighing]
Let's face it,

04:29.335 --> 04:32.003
I just don't look
very heroic.

I love that.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.922
Hi, I'm Bob Adams.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.723
Hi, I'm Larry Jones.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.058
I'm Ernie Barnes.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.393
And I'm Andy Moskowitz,
dude.

04:56.395 --> 04:59.464
Heh, heh,
that's incredible, Larry.

04:59.466 --> 05:03.468
Where'd you guys ever find
such lifelike costumes?

05:03.470 --> 05:07.304
Yuh, we have
a very good tailor.

05:07.306 --> 05:10.341
[Vernon]
Hm, I don't think
they're realistic at all.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.744
I've met the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles,

05:12.746 --> 05:14.578
and you don't look
a bit like them.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.949
How about a dance, short,
green, and handsome?

05:17.951 --> 05:19.817
Whoa, excellent!

05:19.819 --> 05:22.120
I'll teach you
the Turtle Trot!

05:22.122 --> 05:23.921
Cowabunga!

05:23.923 --> 05:26.423
Party on, dudette!

05:40.405 --> 05:43.107
Finally, an almost
perfect entrance.

05:46.078 --> 05:47.979
I did say almost.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.114
[Shredder]
You dipsticks!

05:50.116 --> 05:52.817
You brought us right up
into a fire hydrant!

05:52.819 --> 05:56.954
Gee, I hope we don't get
a ticket for parking here.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.223
Hurry up, you two.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.858
Ugh, but, boss,

06:00.860 --> 06:03.895
this thing is heavy.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.197
[siren in the distance]

06:06.199 --> 06:08.399
Magno-Dyne Labs.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.535
That's where those chemicals
spilled on me.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.837
Out the front door, hurry!

06:12.839 --> 06:14.104
[panting]

06:14.106 --> 06:15.472
Hold it, boss.

06:15.474 --> 06:18.576
We got to take
a rest break.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.482
Uh-oh.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.918
A light.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.786
Oh, that Professor Chumley

06:28.788 --> 06:30.288
must be putting in
some overtime.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.757
Come on, you meatheads!

06:36.461 --> 06:38.495
[gasping]
Shredder!

06:38.497 --> 06:41.532
It's that annoying
Irma from Channel 6.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.968
Stop her before she
warns the Ninja Turtles!

06:43.970 --> 06:46.270
Aah!

06:49.942 --> 06:53.477
She knocked our blasters
right out of our hands.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.780
Why, I oughtta--

06:57.249 --> 06:58.916
Whoa!

06:58.918 --> 07:01.385
Ooh!
[crash]

07:02.254 --> 07:04.655
Boss, are you okay?

07:04.657 --> 07:06.791
Never mind me. Get her!

07:06.793 --> 07:09.393
[panting]

07:09.395 --> 07:11.361
What the heck
is going on here?

07:14.633 --> 07:16.567
I'm lifting a car!

07:16.569 --> 07:17.902
Could it be that--

07:17.904 --> 07:21.472
maybe those chemicals
really did give me
super powers.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.808
All right, you bad guys!

07:23.810 --> 07:25.042
Take this!

07:30.048 --> 07:32.550
Uh, we'd better
beat it, boss.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.552
[Shredder]
For once,
you make sense.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.054
<i>[Vernon on microphone]</i>
<i>Ahem, your attention,</i>
<i>please.</i>

07:37.056 --> 07:40.858
<i>I have the results</i>
<i>of the costume contest</i>

07:40.860 --> 07:43.361
<i>And the winning costume is...</i>

07:43.363 --> 07:47.665
<i>the Teenage Mutant Ninja...</i>

07:47.667 --> 07:48.866
<i>Aardvark!</i>

07:48.868 --> 07:50.034
[all]
Huh?

07:50.036 --> 07:51.735
[applause]

07:51.737 --> 07:53.303
That copycat!

07:53.305 --> 07:55.272
What a crummy costume.

07:56.374 --> 07:58.709
[Vernon]
Congratulations, Chief.

07:58.711 --> 08:00.544
Burne Thompson?

08:00.546 --> 08:02.780
How come his costume
won over ours?

08:02.782 --> 08:04.749
You don't suppose
the fact that he's the boss

08:04.751 --> 08:06.651
has something to do
with it, do you?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.519
[all]
Nah.

08:10.522 --> 08:12.423
April, April,
you won't believe it!

08:12.425 --> 08:14.325
Those chemicals
that spilled on me

08:14.327 --> 08:16.327
really did give me
super powers!

08:16.329 --> 08:17.928
That's impossible, Irma.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.363
But it's true!

08:19.365 --> 08:22.599
I just sent Shredder
and his two mutants running...

08:22.601 --> 08:25.235
with just my bare hands.

08:25.237 --> 08:28.006
Irma, you're upset.
We'd better take you home.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.540
For sure.

08:29.542 --> 08:32.210
[Irma]
I tell you,
it really happened.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.346
I knocked those laser blasters
right out of their hands!

08:35.347 --> 08:37.414
[Raphael]
Right, Irma,
of course you did.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.116
Honest!

08:39.118 --> 08:40.885
And then
I lifted up a car,

08:40.886 --> 08:42.785
and I flung it
through the air.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.588
Sure you did.

08:44.590 --> 08:47.925
[sigh]
Doesn't anyone believe me?

08:47.927 --> 08:50.995
Well, don't worry, Irma.
I believe you.

08:50.997 --> 08:52.496
Not!

08:53.598 --> 08:54.999
Well, see you later.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.568
<i>Ciao,</i> dudettes!

08:57.570 --> 09:00.637
Come on, Irma.
Let's go home.

09:00.639 --> 09:02.406
[Man]
Psst, hey, you.

09:02.408 --> 09:05.375
Give us all your money.

09:10.048 --> 09:13.384
Okay, Your Highness
and Wacko Woman,

09:13.386 --> 09:14.585
just
give us your money,

09:14.587 --> 09:16.119
and there won't be
no trouble.

09:16.121 --> 09:17.555
Don't worry, April.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.091
I'll protect you
with my super powers!

09:21.093 --> 09:22.693
Irma, get real.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.362
You don't have
any super powers.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.864
Quit stalling
and hand over the dough.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.699
Hey, I'm warning you.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.368
Don't you come any closer.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.736
[chuckling]
Oh, yeah?

09:31.738 --> 09:33.404
Try and stop us.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.573
[April screaming]

09:35.575 --> 09:38.242
That sounded like April.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.977
She must be in trouble.

09:39.979 --> 09:41.479
Huh?

09:45.417 --> 09:47.585
[both]
Whoa!

09:49.554 --> 09:50.755
I don't believe it!

09:50.757 --> 09:54.057
This is the only place
for garbage like you!

09:57.730 --> 10:00.297
[Leonardo]
Irma, I hate
to admit it,

10:00.299 --> 10:03.067
but it looks like
you really do have
super powers.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.202
Yeah, and pretty soon,

10:05.204 --> 10:08.238
the whole world will know
about my amazing abilities.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.975
I'm gonna clean up
crime in this city.

10:12.010 --> 10:13.244
Chill out, dudette.

10:13.246 --> 10:16.514
Crime fighting
is a mondo-dangerous
career move.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.582
Yeah, Michelangelo
is right.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.685
You'd better
leave it to us young,
urban professionals.

10:20.687 --> 10:24.188
Ha! You Turtles don't even
have any special powers!

10:24.190 --> 10:27.157

We've got
to do something.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.069
She's going
to get herself
in deep trouble.

Relax. I snuck
a homing transmitter
under her cape.

Huh?

11:11.870 --> 11:14.238
Gee, I don't even
remember touching him.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.775
Irma, you
just came this close
to getting clobbered!

11:17.777 --> 11:20.143
You've got to stop this
before you get hurt.

11:20.145 --> 11:22.580
Ha! You guys
are just jealous

11:22.582 --> 11:25.750

this is going to be
a long night.

Look at all this cash!

11:35.895 --> 11:38.228

with this!

There's
nobody here.
Look.

15:24.490 --> 15:25.790
That must
have been made

15:25.792 --> 15:28.292
by one of Shredder's

15:28.294 --> 15:30.327
Well, he's gone now,

15:30.329 --> 15:33.363
Yeah, and so is
the reverse polarity magnet.

15:33.365 --> 15:36.867

be with them.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.979
Excellent.

to the amplifying antenna

15:52.317 --> 15:53.917
on top of the Technodrome,

15:53.919 --> 15:55.585

15:55.587 --> 15:58.989
to pulverize the city
into obedience.

Hey!

16:01.093 --> 16:04.194

So I'll settle
for super-cunning.

a fix on Irma.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.190
It's very faint.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.025
I think she's
in the Technodrome.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.426
The Technodrome?

16:36.428 --> 16:39.163
But that's at the bottom
of the ocean.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.864
I came as fast
as I could.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.980

Well, actually,
my favorite hero

16:56.982 --> 16:59.650
is Super Irma.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.887
Professor, tell us
about this reverse
polarity magnet.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.521
Well, someone tried
to steal it on Halloween.

17:05.523 --> 17:06.924
Hold on.

17:06.925 --> 17:09.259
That's the night Irma
tangled with Shredder

17:09.261 --> 17:11.060
outside the Magno-Dyne Labs.

17:11.063 --> 17:14.498
The same night
that she discovered
her super powers.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.898
That explains it.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.867
If Irma was walking
by the building

17:17.869 --> 17:20.404
just as Shredder
turned on the anti-magnet,

17:20.406 --> 17:23.673
then her entire costume
would be anti-magnetized.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.675
Which means it would repel
anything made of metal.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.678
Like those muggers'
weapons.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.481
Or those bank robber
dudes' motor hogs.

17:31.483 --> 17:34.985
Giving Irma the illusion
of super-strengh.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.586
Well, temporarily,
of course.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.522

on Halloween

17:40.726 --> 17:42.760
at approximately 6 p.m.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.628
That means the effects
should wear off

17:44.630 --> 17:47.030
in about, uh,
five minutes.

17:47.032 --> 17:49.199

in the Technodrome!

17:54.272 --> 17:55.906
In another moment,

17:55.908 --> 17:59.009
the anti-magnet
will be installed.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.511
Not so fast, Krang!

all the way down here?

18:08.287 --> 18:10.720

a woman of steel.

18:10.722 --> 18:13.490

little sayings.

18:23.435 --> 18:27.337

those powers

get her!

18:45.757 --> 18:46.690
You bet.

18:49.327 --> 18:50.660
Gotcha.

18:50.662 --> 18:51.962
It's done.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.598
To the control room.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.702
That battleship
doing target practice
near the harbor

18:58.704 --> 19:00.670
should serve nice.

19:10.681 --> 19:12.582
But what could
Krang and Shredder

19:12.584 --> 19:14.284
want
the anti-magnet for?

19:14.286 --> 19:16.220
Uh, could it have
something to do

19:16.222 --> 19:18.255
with a 300-ton battleship

19:18.257 --> 19:19.723

toward us?

19:23.729 --> 19:26.430
Whoa, with all the ammunition
that thing's carrying,

19:26.432 --> 19:29.166
it could blow the city
clear into the suburbs.

could your anti-magnet
be doing this?

19:32.505 --> 19:35.539
If its power were
amplified enough, yes.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.941
What are we
waiting for, dudes?

19:39.511 --> 19:42.012
We're going to have to get
down to the Technodrome,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.680
get control
of the anti-magnet,

19:43.682 --> 19:44.882
and rescue Irma.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.816
Uh, but how do we do that?

19:46.818 --> 19:48.085
Simple.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.420
By converting the Turtle Van
to submarine mode.

at the bottom
of the ocean.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.968
Hopefully, we won't have
to make this trip too often.

20:04.970 --> 20:08.071
The Turtle Van can't take
too much of this undersea
pressure.

You just sealed
your doom, Turtle!

your mouth, Shred Head!

and dice, hmm?

down gently.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.866
Face it, you're shredded,

21:14.806 --> 21:17.141
Quickly, we must flee.

We'll escape
through that hatch.

21:20.346 --> 21:23.213
Oh, no, not there!
[Shredder]
Why not?

21:23.215 --> 21:27.984
[Krang]
Because it's
the garbage chute!

21:27.986 --> 21:31.087
Whoa, we sure trashed
those dudes!

21:31.089 --> 21:32.255
Phew, there.

21:32.257 --> 21:34.291
I've rewired the controls

21:34.293 --> 21:37.494
to turn that anti-magnet
into a regular magnet.

21:37.496 --> 21:40.063
Great. But what about
the Technodrome?

21:40.065 --> 21:41.465
[Donatello]
Those empty target ships

21:41.467 --> 21:44.067
are just the thing
to put it out of commission.

21:44.069 --> 21:46.670
Okay, now let's
get out of here.

21:46.672 --> 21:49.773
Aw, gee, and I was just
getting comfy down here.

21:49.775 --> 21:51.575
[beeping]
Come on, in one minute,

21:51.577 --> 21:54.311
this place is gonna
have more leaks
than the Titanic!

21:56.013 --> 21:57.947
[buzzing]

22:15.200 --> 22:16.833
Boss. Boss?

22:16.835 --> 22:19.302
Um, we got a problem.

22:19.304 --> 22:21.038
You've got a problem?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.373
Look at me. I'm covered
with garbage.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.242
Well, I can fix that.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.181
But we still got
this other problem.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.351
Yeah, the whole
joint flooded.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.186
Don't just stand there.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.021
Plug up those leaks!

22:39.524 --> 22:40.857
[Donatello]
So, you see, Irma,

22:40.859 --> 22:42.759
When the anti-magnetism
wore off,

22:42.761 --> 22:45.195
your so-called powers
vanished along with it.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.663
Bummer, babe.

22:46.665 --> 22:49.632
From hero to zero
in a single day.

22:49.634 --> 22:51.168
Nah, it's okay.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.338
I couldn't have taken being
a superhero much longer anyway.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.606
Well, why not?
Scared of the danger?

22:56.608 --> 22:59.309
Sick of being mobbed
by adoring fans?

22:59.311 --> 23:01.211
Tired of battling bad guys?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.646
Oh, no, nothing like that.

23:03.648 --> 23:05.148
It's just that this costume

23:05.150 --> 23:07.384
is giving me an awful rash!

23:14.058 --> 23:16.994
