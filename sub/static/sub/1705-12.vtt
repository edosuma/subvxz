19:12.242 --> 19:15.244
can you redeem one murder
by committing another?

19:15.278 --> 19:16.979
You're a Marine, Brody.

19:17.014 --> 19:18.547
The rules are different.

19:18.582 --> 19:20.649

19:20.684 --> 19:23.486
But I'm not a Marine anymore.

19:23.520 --> 19:27.223
I haven't been for some time.

19:27.257 --> 19:28.891
You were asked to do a mission

19:28.925 --> 19:30.726
on behalf of your country,

19:30.761 --> 19:31.927
and you did it.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.095
Is that what you tell yourself?

19:33.130 --> 19:34.230
That's what I believe.

19:34.264 --> 19:36.065
Wind us up and point us
in a direction?

19:36.099 --> 19:37.533
If that's what you think,

19:37.567 --> 19:40.202
- why'd you agree to do it
in the first place? - That is becoming

19:40.237 --> 19:42.772

As if things couldn't
get more complicated, right?

20:17.174 --> 20:19.909

- Well, I'm saying it now.

20:19.943 --> 20:20.910
- Hey.
- Don't.

20:20.944 --> 20:22.078
Hey, hey.

back home either,

20:23.847 --> 20:26.215

have or we don't have,

20:26.249 --> 20:28.050

20:28.085 --> 20:30.152

20:30.187 --> 20:31.720
And I'm not sorry about that.

20:31.755 --> 20:34.323
Not for one single second.
Because I happen to believe

20:34.357 --> 20:36.592
one of the reasons
I was put on this earth

20:36.626 --> 20:38.360
was for our paths to cross.

20:38.395 --> 20:41.931

22:41.117 --> 22:43.686

- I said be quiet.

Would you just call him
before you do anything else?

22:45.555 --> 22:46.755
There is no need
to call anybody.

22:46.790 --> 22:49.558
- But there is, please...

Javadi's men.

back to Herat?

23:51.021 --> 23:52.121
I did.

23:52.155 --> 23:54.256

24:08.805 --> 24:10.339
Even if I thought
that was a mistake?

Always has been.

24:16.212 --> 24:17.646
That we're loyal to our people?

24:17.681 --> 24:19.982

come before the mission.

Brody arrested is better for us

39:59.354 --> 40:00.655
(door creaks open)

40:06.028 --> 40:07.995
What did you bring me?

40:08.030 --> 40:11.833
They were out of baguettes,
so I got croissants instead.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.768
Oh.

40:13.802 --> 40:16.471
(sighs)

40:22.144 --> 40:24.145
Did you see this?

40:24.179 --> 40:26.447
I did.

40:26.482 --> 40:28.449
What do you think?

40:28.484 --> 40:31.486
I think we should buy this place
and never leave.

40:33.789 --> 40:36.624
"In a stunning development
at the Geneva summit,

40:36.658 --> 40:39.727
Iranian diplomats have
offered IAEA inspectors

40:39.761 --> 40:42.630
full and unfettered access to
the regime's nuclear sites

40:42.664 --> 40:45.600
in exchange for the lifting
of economic sanctions."

40:45.634 --> 40:47.835
Saul...

40:47.870 --> 40:50.538
this is you.

40:50.572 --> 40:52.707
You did this.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.876
Not just me.

40:54.910 --> 40:56.911
It's unbelievable.

40:56.945 --> 40:59.013
It's your whole life.

40:59.047 --> 41:01.015
It's your crowning achievement.

41:01.049 --> 41:03.384
(laughs)

41:03.418 --> 41:05.686
Only cost me my career.

41:05.721 --> 41:09.490
Well... yeah, but it's a hell
of a way to go out.

41:09.525 --> 41:11.392
(laughs)

41:11.426 --> 41:13.060
Come with me to Washington.

41:13.095 --> 41:15.363
I told you, I'm going
to go to New York.

41:15.397 --> 41:16.731
I'm gonna set up the apartment.

41:16.765 --> 41:18.633
It's only gonna be
for a couple days.

41:18.667 --> 41:20.501
I am not setting foot
in that building,

41:20.536 --> 41:22.837
and neither should you after
the way they treated you.

41:22.871 --> 41:25.039
It's the annual
commemorative ceremony.

41:25.073 --> 41:27.675
We've got 132 new stars

41:27.709 --> 41:29.977
to put up on that wall.

41:32.014 --> 41:34.415
Did you make a plan
to see Carrie?

41:34.449 --> 41:36.984
I called a couple times.

41:37.019 --> 41:39.220
I left messages.

41:39.254 --> 41:41.222
I never heard back.

41:41.256 --> 41:43.024
Hmm. Strange.

41:43.058 --> 41:44.959
She's probably just busy.

41:44.993 --> 41:46.928
You know how it is.

42:02.244 --> 42:04.478
You can go right in.
He's waiting for you.

42:04.513 --> 42:06.480
Thank you.

42:08.216 --> 42:09.850
Carrie.

42:09.885 --> 42:11.452
Mr. Director.

42:11.486 --> 42:13.187
Please, have a seat.

42:15.557 --> 42:17.391
You look well.

42:17.426 --> 42:19.093
If large.

42:19.127 --> 42:21.429
I assume we lose you
to maternity leave soon?

42:21.463 --> 42:23.431
I'll probably need
a few hours off.

42:23.465 --> 42:25.433
(laughs)

42:25.467 --> 42:27.735
That is some news
coming out of Geneva.

42:27.769 --> 42:29.236
It's amazing.

42:29.271 --> 42:30.805
Saul was right.

42:30.839 --> 42:32.940
Javadi's proven
immensely successful

42:32.975 --> 42:35.576
at influencing Iranian
policy at the highest levels.

42:35.611 --> 42:39.246
Well, one thing about Saul--
he's usually right.

42:39.281 --> 42:41.315
I couldn't keep him on, Carrie.

42:41.350 --> 42:43.084
I hope you understand why.

42:43.118 --> 42:45.319
Maybe we can agree
to disagree on that.

42:45.354 --> 42:47.221
- That's funny.
- What?

42:47.255 --> 42:49.223
"Agree to disagree."

42:49.257 --> 42:51.258
That's exactly how
he would have put it.

42:51.293 --> 42:53.761
Back to Javadi, though.

42:53.795 --> 42:55.196
Have you done any thinking

42:55.230 --> 42:56.664
about what we discussed
last week?

42:56.698 --> 42:59.300
I have... and you're right.

42:59.334 --> 43:02.269
My being in Istanbul would
make running Javadi easier.

43:02.304 --> 43:04.605
It's arguably the premier
posting in the region.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.941
And you'd be Station Chief.

43:06.975 --> 43:08.976
The youngest in the
history of the Agency.

43:09.011 --> 43:11.078
Can I handpick my people?

43:11.113 --> 43:12.413
Up to a point.

43:12.447 --> 43:15.082
I'd like you to keep
Tony Shadid on as deputy,

43:15.117 --> 43:16.784
in order to smooth
the transition.

43:16.818 --> 43:19.353
I can live with that.

43:19.388 --> 43:21.255
Then you're in.

43:21.289 --> 43:23.758
(sighs):
I'm in.

43:23.792 --> 43:25.860
Excellent.

43:26.662 --> 43:27.762
- (laughs)
- Excellent.

43:27.796 --> 43:29.664
Uh, well, we'll
discuss a timeline

43:29.698 --> 43:31.632
- over the next few weeks.
- Great.

43:31.667 --> 43:33.100
Congratulations.

43:33.135 --> 43:34.468
Thank you.

43:37.172 --> 43:38.939
- Um, sir?
- Yes?

43:40.509 --> 43:43.344
About the commemorative
ceremony on Friday...

43:43.378 --> 43:44.612
What about it?

43:44.646 --> 43:45.780
(sighs)

43:45.814 --> 43:49.316
I think Nicholas Brody
deserves a star.

43:50.919 --> 43:52.920
He fulfills the criteria, sir.

43:52.954 --> 43:55.790
- Putting aside your personal connection
to him. - He was an Agency asset

43:55.824 --> 43:58.659
who died while
serving his country.

43:58.694 --> 44:00.661
- I'll stop you there.
- Heroically, in my opinion.

44:00.696 --> 44:02.430
First of all,
he wasn't technically

44:02.464 --> 44:03.964
an employee of the CIA.

44:03.999 --> 44:06.667
Well... technically?
Come on.

44:06.702 --> 44:10.137
Second of all, his actions
previous to the Tehran mission

44:10.172 --> 44:12.139
cast a long shadow.

44:12.174 --> 44:15.910
Sir, he was a US Marine
who was captured and tortured

44:15.944 --> 44:18.045
for eight years.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.581
Who are we to stand in judgment?

44:20.615 --> 44:23.350
No one's judging him.

44:23.385 --> 44:27.922
I'm just not memorializing him
on the walls of this building.

44:27.956 --> 44:30.624
That's where I draw the line.

44:33.295 --> 44:36.330
Is this gonna be
an ongoing problem between us?

44:39.034 --> 44:40.668
No, sir.

44:58.420 --> 45:01.288
We'll have to see.
I don't know.

45:01.323 --> 45:03.524
I got to go.

45:06.561 --> 45:08.529
Can I have one of those?

45:08.563 --> 45:10.197
- No.
- Oh, just give me one.

45:10.232 --> 45:11.632
I won't light it.

45:16.671 --> 45:18.506
(sighs)

45:21.309 --> 45:23.978
Something ailing you?

45:24.012 --> 45:26.413
Lockhart.

45:26.448 --> 45:29.116
What did he do?
Besides fuck over Saul.

45:29.151 --> 45:32.052
He just gave me Istanbul.
Station Chief.

45:32.087 --> 45:33.654
- Holy crap.
- I know.

45:33.688 --> 45:35.956
That's bad?

45:35.991 --> 45:38.092
No.

45:38.126 --> 45:39.660
This is bad.

45:39.694 --> 45:41.495
Well, it's a little late
for second thoughts.

45:41.530 --> 45:44.532
- Yeah, no shit.
- So, what's bad about it?

45:46.535 --> 45:49.537
I just didn't think it through.

45:53.241 --> 45:56.944
I wanted it because of Brody,
to have a part of him.

45:56.978 --> 45:59.780
I think they call that love.

46:01.183 --> 46:04.451
It took getting this far,
to the fucking endgame,

46:04.486 --> 46:06.554
to realize it's...

46:07.589 --> 46:09.590
it's impossible.

46:09.624 --> 46:10.658
Why?

46:10.692 --> 46:12.793
- Quinn, I can't be a mother.
- Because?

46:12.828 --> 46:15.596
Because of me.
Because of... my job.

46:15.630 --> 46:18.132
Because of...

46:18.166 --> 46:19.834
my problems.

46:19.868 --> 46:22.002
Everyone has problems.

46:25.207 --> 46:27.174
I'll be a great station chief.

46:27.242 --> 46:30.044
I'll be fearless, obsessed,
ruthless if I have to be--

46:30.078 --> 46:32.046
all the same reasons...

46:32.080 --> 46:33.447
I can't...

46:37.853 --> 46:39.820
That kid is a gift.

46:41.890 --> 46:44.191
You have one, right?

46:44.226 --> 46:46.727
I fucked it up.

46:49.564 --> 46:54.034
And it would be really sad
to see you do the same thing.

47:02.677 --> 47:04.478
(exhales)

47:09.417 --> 47:12.486
Why even bother?
You order the same thing

47:12.520 --> 47:14.521
- every time.
- I know I do,

47:14.556 --> 47:18.259
but in my heart I want to
spread my wings and soar.

47:18.293 --> 47:20.394
Get a grip.

47:20.428 --> 47:23.764
- All hail.
- Please.

47:23.798 --> 47:25.799
It's all anybody in the
building's talking about,

47:25.834 --> 47:27.501
Iran opening its fist.

47:27.535 --> 47:29.203
You know what
they're calling you?

47:30.438 --> 47:32.373
The Maestro.

47:32.407 --> 47:34.942
We got lucky.
Very lucky.

47:34.976 --> 47:37.511
Yeah. Meanwhile, Senator
Lockhart will be dining out

47:37.545 --> 47:40.681
on our luck for the rest
of his natural-born life.

47:40.715 --> 47:42.883
I'm only surprised
they didn't shit-can you, too.

47:42.918 --> 47:44.852
- Ah.
- You have all the qualifications...

47:44.886 --> 47:48.289
experience, loyalty, discretion.

47:48.323 --> 47:50.524
Well, you're better off in the
private sector, no doubt about it.

47:50.558 --> 47:51.625
Come join me.

47:51.660 --> 47:53.894
- I don't think so.
- Sure?

47:53.929 --> 47:55.863
One phone call,
triple your salary.

47:55.897 --> 47:58.032
Nah. I'm a lifer.

47:58.066 --> 48:01.035
Door's always open,
if you change your mind.

48:05.440 --> 48:09.043
I didn't know any better, I'd
say you were missing us already.

48:10.979 --> 48:14.081
Yeah, you are, and you'd
come back, wouldn't you,

48:14.115 --> 48:15.916
if Lockhart came begging?

48:16.952 --> 48:18.452
Never.

48:18.486 --> 48:21.055
In a heartbeat.

48:21.089 --> 48:23.991
WAITRESS:
So, what can I get you?

48:24.025 --> 48:26.093
He'll have a plain waffle,
hold the whipped butter.

48:26.127 --> 48:27.428
He'll have the same.

48:27.462 --> 48:30.130
Two Old Schools, comin' up.

48:44.479 --> 48:45.779
(gasps)

48:45.814 --> 48:48.515
(door opens)
MAGGIE: Hey.

48:48.550 --> 48:49.950
- Hey.
FRANK: - Hello there.

48:49.985 --> 48:51.986
MAGGIE: - Carrie?
- Hi. I forgot

48:52.020 --> 48:55.055
- you were coming. - Oh. Yeah,
we got all of Maggie's old stuff,

48:55.090 --> 48:57.224
including the world's
heaviest crib.

48:59.227 --> 49:00.828
Gosh,

49:00.862 --> 49:02.463
that's a lot
of... things.

49:02.497 --> 49:05.599
Yeah, it seems like it, but you
end up needing all of it, so...

49:06.935 --> 49:09.036
What's this?

49:09.070 --> 49:11.438
It's a Bjorn.
It's easy.

49:11.473 --> 49:12.339
It is?

49:12.374 --> 49:13.907
Yeah, she sleeps right here,

49:13.942 --> 49:15.175
against your chest.

49:15.210 --> 49:16.777
It's like a reverse backpack.

49:17.846 --> 49:18.812
Oh.

49:18.847 --> 49:20.514
You'll get the hang of it.

49:20.548 --> 49:22.049
Do you have a rocking chair?

49:22.083 --> 49:24.351
I was thinking I would
make a rocking chair.

49:24.386 --> 49:26.720
Make it?

49:26.755 --> 49:29.623
Well, I need a project. I'm antsy,
you know, waiting for this girl.

49:31.192 --> 49:33.427
So, how was the ultrasound?

49:34.429 --> 49:36.063
Uh, it was good.

49:36.097 --> 49:38.065
- Yeah.
- Mm.

49:38.099 --> 49:40.100
They said...

49:40.135 --> 49:42.569
the baby's perfect.

49:42.604 --> 49:43.937
Hey.

49:43.972 --> 49:46.540
That should be
a good thing, right?

49:53.048 --> 49:54.715
Um...

49:57.752 --> 50:00.320
Maggie, I'm not
gonna need your stuff.

50:02.290 --> 50:03.824
Why?

50:03.858 --> 50:05.426
I'm moving...

50:05.493 --> 50:07.061
to Istanbul.

50:07.095 --> 50:10.097
You're moving
to Istanbul? When?

50:10.131 --> 50:12.066
Soon. Right
after she's born.

50:12.100 --> 50:14.802
Will she come with you
in the Bjorn?

50:19.474 --> 50:21.275
I can't keep her.

50:22.977 --> 50:24.845
That's what I'm saying.

50:24.879 --> 50:26.246
Don't... now don't
you say that.

50:26.281 --> 50:29.083
It's sick, I know, but...

50:29.117 --> 50:30.918
I can't.

50:30.952 --> 50:32.719
Yes, you can.

50:32.754 --> 50:35.422
Come on, you guys
know better than anyone

50:35.457 --> 50:37.424
how bad it gets with me.

50:37.459 --> 50:39.593
Carrie, I've been
thinking about this.

50:39.627 --> 50:41.628
A lot.

50:41.663 --> 50:43.630
I think...

50:43.665 --> 50:45.699
she's going to ground you.

50:45.733 --> 50:48.001
Make you focus.
Be healthy.

50:48.036 --> 50:50.404
And I think you
will be astonished

50:50.438 --> 50:52.539
by the love you have for her.

50:53.575 --> 50:56.076
Well, there's no sign of that.

50:56.111 --> 50:57.211
There will be.

50:57.245 --> 50:58.479
No, really.

50:58.513 --> 51:01.448
I... I don't feel love.

51:01.483 --> 51:04.518
All I feel...

51:04.552 --> 51:06.253
is scared.

51:06.287 --> 51:07.721
Two tours in Baghdad,

51:07.755 --> 51:10.290
now a baby is bringing
you to your knees?

51:10.325 --> 51:11.692
Yeah. Yeah.

51:11.726 --> 51:13.594
Look, can we just
take this day by day?

51:13.628 --> 51:15.062
FRANK: You are not
leaving this kid,

51:15.096 --> 51:17.264
- not like your mother did to you.
- Dad!

51:17.298 --> 51:20.267
You don't want her...

51:20.301 --> 51:22.069
I'll take her.

51:23.905 --> 51:26.039
What...

51:26.074 --> 51:27.975
You would do that?

51:28.009 --> 51:30.077
