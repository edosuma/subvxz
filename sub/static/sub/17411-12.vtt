             - Wow.
 Can you believe we built this?

01:00.494 --> 01:03.195
- Well, if we're being factual,
         I built this,

01:03.197 --> 01:04.430
     But you were very good

01:04.432 --> 01:06.565
   In the "flinching in fear"
          department.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.367
           What is up
  with you and hammers, dude?

01:08.369 --> 01:09.701
    - Well, it's number four
           on my list

01:09.703 --> 01:11.270
           Of things
      that I'm afraid of.

01:11.272 --> 01:15.240
 There's snakes, guns, peanuts,
    hammers, and quicksand.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.110
  You know that mostly exists
   only in the movies, right?

01:18.112 --> 01:20.312
 - Says every quicksand victim
             ever.

01:20.314 --> 01:23.248
   - Well, hammering is like
    a male rite of passage,

01:23.250 --> 01:24.583
   So you're definitely gonna
         have to try it

01:24.585 --> 01:26.251
       Before we're done
      building this house.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.120
    - Oh, hey, check it out.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.656
   I thought we wouldn't want
   any girls in our man cave.

01:30.658 --> 01:34.293
  - [laughs] marcus, you know,
   there's gonna come a time

01:34.295 --> 01:36.295
   Where you're gonna welcome
         spending time

01:36.297 --> 01:38.530
         With a member
       of the fairer sex.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.566
         A special girl
    will come into your life

01:40.568 --> 01:45.104
And bring about a seismic shift
   in how you see the world.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.139
- Oh, it's really coming along,
           isn't it?

01:47.141 --> 01:48.841
         Can I come up?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

            [grunts]

01:49.844 --> 01:51.276
    I would let you up here,

01:51.278 --> 01:54.646
      But marcus just made
       this lovely sign.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.883
         Well, I found
   this brilliant hemp fabric

01:57.885 --> 02:02.321
     And I'm going to make
  some curtains for your fort.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.189
        - Okay, listen,
     this is a tree house.

02:04.191 --> 02:07.426
  It's not some hippie hideout
      for beatnik barbie.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.328
          - Oh, well,
    you just sassed yourself

02:09.330 --> 02:12.331
  Out of sustainable curtains,
          didn't you?

02:13.900 --> 02:16.201
             - Sam.
        What's going on?

02:16.203 --> 02:18.370
          What--what--
         are you okay?

02:18.372 --> 02:21.440
   You know my crazy neighbor
  down the hall, the hoarder?

02:21.442 --> 02:26.178
             Cool.
Is she living in her own filth?

02:26.180 --> 02:28.714
     Is her place infested
          with vermin?

02:28.716 --> 02:30.415
  Did they have to remove her
         with a crane?

02:30.417 --> 02:31.517
         - Stop. Stop.
            Stop it.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.619
          - Yes, yes,
     and it wasn't a crane.

02:33.621 --> 02:34.920
       It was a forklift.
             - Oh.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.722
        - But, you know,
  all the tenants and myself--

02:36.724 --> 02:38.223
       We were all forced
          to evacuate,

02:38.225 --> 02:40.492
       So I have no idea
       what I'm gonna do,

02:40.494 --> 02:41.693
      Where I'm gonna go.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.729
          - Oh, well,
 you should stay here with me.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.297
           - Really?
           - Really?

02:45.299 --> 02:47.799
        - Yeah, really.
    I mean, it'll be so fun.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.402
          It'd be like
   an extended slumber party.

02:50.404 --> 02:54.273
      You can stay as long
          as you want.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.440
           - That...

02:55.442 --> 02:56.775
            Is so...

02:56.777 --> 02:58.310
           Generous.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.479
         And honestly,
it's a massive, massive relief.

03:00.481 --> 03:03.315
   I mean, when they told me
  the building was condemned--

03:03.317 --> 03:04.917
     - Con--say that again.
           Condemned?

03:04.919 --> 03:07.853
     Just until, you know,
     I figure this all out.

03:07.855 --> 03:11.223
      - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.226
           - [sighs]
   you are such a lifesaver.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.594
  - Oh, you're moving in now.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.462
          Okay, great.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.665

        You're folding.
            - Okay.

  But hopefully for, you know,
 less than that amount of time,

04:02.876 --> 04:06.345

           - Come on.
           - Grow up.

   ended up living together.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.524

          - Permanent.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.472
    Well, this is temporary.
          Sam said so.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.574
       - First, you know,
       it was so gradual,

04:35.576 --> 04:37.276
      You just don't even
         see it coming.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.444
  There's, like, a toothbrush
    in my toothbrush holder,

04:39.446 --> 04:41.280
            And then
    there was throw pillows,

04:41.282 --> 04:42.447
        Scented candles.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.616
      - Why are you saying
        scented candles

04:44.618 --> 04:45.951
   Like they're a good thing?

04:45.953 --> 04:47.753
    - Because they're nice,
  especially in the bathroom.

04:47.755 --> 04:51.290
         - Oh, my god.
            - What?

        - Shut up, man.
       - What's laurie'd?

04:56.664 --> 04:58.297
      - Yeah, that's what
         we called it.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.500
        - More and more
     of your stuff came in,

05:01.502 --> 05:04.369
       And more and more
of andy's stuff just went away.

05:04.371 --> 05:05.570
       - I can't believe
      you called it that.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.406
      - He called it that,
          and I said,

05:07.408 --> 05:09.675
    "this is inappropriate.
   This is the girl I love."

  And my pulse is already back
   to its resting heart rate.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.653
          So I bought
 this potted succulent for sam.

           - Hi, sam.
             - Hi.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.991
       - I don't believe
      in cutting flowers,

06:32.993 --> 06:34.393
       But I do believe--

06:34.395 --> 06:37.896

            I think.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.832
 - Welcome to the neighborhood.
    - Oh, that is so sweet.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.882
 We should do it at our place.
         - "our place."

07:05.926 --> 07:08.760
    - Did you already start
     the apartment search?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.595
             - Yes.
     Well, I mean, sort of.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.431
  I'm figuring out my options.
            - Right.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.932
    - There's actually a lot
          to consider.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.000
            - Yeah.
            - So...

07:15.002 --> 07:16.668
            - Yeah.
    - Um, but you know what?

07:16.670 --> 07:17.836
   I think that we'll be able
 to make Saturday work, fiona.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.905
            - Great.
            - Yeah.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.574
      - "I'm figuring out
          my options.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.076
     There's actually a lot
         to consider."

07:25.078 --> 07:28.613
I mean, the wording is so vague.
   What does that even mean?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.715
          - I'm afraid
  I'm gonna need more context

07:30.717 --> 07:32.784
      If you want me to be
    of any assistance, will.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.555
 Your mom asked sam if she was
   looking for an apartment,

07:36.557 --> 07:39.224
And sam said, "there's actually
      a lot to consider."

07:39.226 --> 07:42.828
      It's the "actually"
       that's troubling.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.730
    Do you see what I mean?
       - I really don't.

07:45.732 --> 07:49.067
   Where you're better served
    speaking with an adult.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.971
      - I guess I'm just--
 I'm scared I'm being laurie'd.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.873
       - I'm not familiar
    with "laurie" as a verb.

07:54.875 --> 07:58.543
- Oh, it's where your apartment
         and your life

07:58.545 --> 07:59.878
      Just gets taken over

07:59.880 --> 08:01.813
     Without your knowledge
          or consent.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.850
  - That can actually happen?
       - It actually can.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.152
   - Have you given any more
 thought to hanging up my sign?

08:07.154 --> 08:10.222
       - Yeah, you know,
          I actually--

08:10.224 --> 08:12.157
        I actually have.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.859
            [laughs]
       I'm cool with it.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.995
   I am totally cool with it.
       No girls allowed.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.498
            [grunts]
        all right, man.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.132
         Nail that in.
            Courage.

08:21.134 --> 08:24.836
   - Marcus, dinner's ready.
    - Tell her you're busy.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.873
        - Uh, can I have
    five more minutes, mom?

08:27.875 --> 08:30.976
I'm considering doing something
 symbolically meaningful here.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.177
        - You too, will.
            Come on.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.746
     Food's gonna get cold.
      - Okay, I got to go.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.115
          - Ugh. Wuss.
          - Boys, huh?

08:37.116 --> 08:38.616
- Yeah, this could take a while.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.618
      - I made guacamole,

08:39.620 --> 08:44.623
  You wouldn't happen to have
 any extra avocados, would you?

08:44.625 --> 08:45.790
            - I do.
           Come over.

08:45.792 --> 08:46.791
            - Okay.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.960
            - Right.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.795
         There we are.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.731
         Come sit down.
  Do you want a glass of wine?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.533
        - No, it's okay.
       I'm not drinking.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.067
          - Oh, I am.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.103
            So how's
  the apartment search going?

08:58.105 --> 09:00.572
    I saw you hesitate a bit
         the other day.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.107
       - You caught that.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.576
      You don't think, uh,
     will noticed, do you?

09:04.578 --> 09:09.314
        - Nah, doubt it.
 I mean, he's a man, isn't he?

09:09.316 --> 09:11.116
          What is it?
             - Huh?

09:11.118 --> 09:12.851
             - Huh?
           - Nothing.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.954
    I mean, maybe something.
         I don't know.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.956
     Things have been going
  really well with will and I,

09:17.958 --> 09:19.658
       But the other day,

09:19.660 --> 09:21.593
     Life kind of threw me
          a curveball,

09:21.595 --> 09:23.094
 Something I wasn't expecting,

09:23.096 --> 09:25.063
     At least not this soon
      in our relationship.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.197
             - Oh.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.900
         And this, uh,
       unexpected thing--

09:28.902 --> 09:31.069
      Did you talk to will
    about that yet, did you?

09:31.071 --> 09:32.971
           - Not yet.
         You know, I--

09:32.973 --> 09:37.075
 Because I'm not gonna be sure
 for, like, another day or so,

09:37.077 --> 09:40.345
         But I do know
 that it doesn't make any sense

09:40.347 --> 09:42.213
    To look for an apartment
      until I'm positive.

09:42.215 --> 09:45.650
            - Mm-mm.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.819
              Mm.

09:51.058 --> 09:56.361
          Well, I used
      to despise avocados,

09:56.363 --> 10:00.966
  And then when I was pregnant
          with marcus,

10:00.968 --> 10:03.001
         I craved them.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.003
             - God,
   what are those boys doing?

10:05.005 --> 10:06.905
         I'm starving.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.875
         He is so great
          with marcus.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.711
       I could really see
       happily ever after

10:12.713 --> 10:14.746
       Happening for us--

10:14.748 --> 10:17.182
        Marriage, kids,
           the works.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.017
   He's gonna be a great dad.

10:23.990 --> 10:24.222
               .

10:24.224 --> 10:26.791
             - Wow.
        Multiple forks.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.259
  - It's not too pretentious,
             is it?

10:28.261 --> 10:31.262
  - No, no, I think it's just
the right amount of pretentious.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.765
         - Hey, I think
    three forks are classy.

10:33.767 --> 10:34.966
 - Well, I just didn't realize
         we were eating

10:34.968 --> 10:36.968
 So many different-sized foods.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.203
        [knock at door]
             - ooh.

10:38.205 --> 10:41.006
      Our guests are here.
        - "our guests."

10:42.842 --> 10:46.144
 - Hi, guys. Well, come on in.
            - Hello.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.980
    Well, I was gonna bring
           some wine,

10:48.982 --> 10:52.317
  But then I thought you might
   appreciate avocados more.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.352
       Do you appreciate
         avocados more?

10:54.354 --> 10:56.721
           - They are
    definitely appreciated.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.723
   We're not having guacamole
            tonight,

10:58.725 --> 11:00.058
       But I always love
        a good avocado.

11:00.060 --> 11:04.329
 [whispering] oh, so--so I know
     it's not my business,

11:04.331 --> 11:07.365
But the unexpected life thing--

11:07.367 --> 11:09.234
   Did you find out for sure
          about that?

11:09.236 --> 11:13.338
    - Um, I did, and, uh...

11:13.340 --> 11:14.339
        It is for sure.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.274
           - [gasps]

11:16.276 --> 11:19.844
     How did will take it?
   - I haven't told him yet.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.113
   I'm just kind of terrified
    of how he's gonna react.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.281
             - Aw.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.150
         [timer buzzes]
   - ooh, that's the quiche.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.317
         Want to help?
            - Sure.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.219
   - Did you hear that, dude?
          - Hear what?

11:28.221 --> 11:31.289
           - Quiche.
      It's come to quiche.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.925
        - I love quiche.
           - [sighs]

11:36.295 --> 11:39.330
          - Everything
   is really delicious, sam.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.333
     - And the second fork
really adds a sense of occasion.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.236
    - Oh, thank you, marcus.
So how's the tree house coming?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.738
      I'd love to come up
      and see it sometime.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.373
          - I'm afraid
    that won't be possible,

11:48.375 --> 11:49.741
  Because will finally agreed

11:49.743 --> 11:51.309
       To put up my sign
       disavowing women.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.278
        - No women, huh?
          - [chuckles]

11:53.280 --> 11:54.279
    - Afraid we're gonna be
          too awesome

11:54.281 --> 11:57.015
       - We're not afraid
      of your awesomeness.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.950
          We're afraid
  you might try and laurie us.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.419
           - [chokes]
            I just--

12:01.421 --> 12:04.989
      What does that mean?
    - Kids are so hilarious.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.491
    - They're adorable too,
       aren't they, will?

12:06.493 --> 12:08.927
     Children are adorable.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.328
          - Seriously,
  what does "laurie you" mean?

12:10.330 --> 12:12.097
        - You know what?
  It's really hard to explain.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.265
   It's kind of complicated.
         - Not really.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.434
      - Laurie'ing is when
your tree house gets taken over

12:16.436 --> 12:18.236
            Without
   your immediate awareness.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.772
 It's sort of like what you're
  doing with will's apartment.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.408
            - Dude!
            - What?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.210
 - Now that I hear it out loud,
           I can see

12:25.212 --> 12:26.478
    How that could be viewed
      as a negative thing.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.380
  - You think I'm taking over?
       - No, not at all.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.383
    Listen, here's the deal.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.787
    Maybe I do a little bit,
 but andy loved being laurie'd,

12:35.789 --> 12:38.423
      And maybe I'll learn
        to like it too.

12:38.425 --> 12:42.761
  It just--it feels, you know,
    very kind of permanent.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.829
     Not permanent--sudden.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.064
    - I think we should go.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.099
 - But I haven't gotten to try
         my third fork.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.400
         I've been told
       it's for dessert.

12:49.402 --> 12:52.971
         You guys stay.
          I'm leaving.

12:52.973 --> 12:57.308
       For this situation
     to be permanent, will.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.410
         I just needed
        a place to stay.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.445
             - Sam.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.220
       - I'm sorry, will.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.356
   I can't help but feel like
     I had something to do

13:11.358 --> 13:12.524
     With sam storming out.

13:12.526 --> 13:15.527
   - No, no, you had nothing
         to do with it.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.428
 - Maybe you should be running
           after her,

13:17.430 --> 13:19.464
         Because maybe
   there are things happening

13:19.466 --> 13:22.834
- We just all need to cool off,
            I think.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.169
      - All right, marcus,
    you need to go home now.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.105
  Back through the dumbwaiter.
             Go on.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.907
         Run, run, run.
         Just trust me.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.509
  - Why are you being so weird
        and aggressive?

13:31.511 --> 13:32.944
           - Oh, god,
       you're such a man.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.846
          Look around.

13:34.848 --> 13:38.316
  Don't actually look around.
       Look at the signs.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.584
         She moves in.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.953
     She's taking her time
     getting an apartment.

13:41.955 --> 13:45.190
          She's eating
       a lot of avocados.

13:45.192 --> 13:49.894
  How her breasts have become
    significantly engorged.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.396
   - You've been checking out
          sam's rack?

13:51.398 --> 13:53.531
           - I'm not.
            Ew! No!

13:53.533 --> 13:56.501
          Oh, my god.
  I shouldn't be saying this.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.503
             Sam...

13:58.505 --> 14:01.306
     Is expecting something

14:01.308 --> 14:04.275
   That she wasn't expecting,

14:04.277 --> 14:07.245
       And she's worried
      about your reaction

14:07.247 --> 14:09.280
  When she tells you her news

14:09.282 --> 14:12.550
   Of what she is expecting.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.551
            - What?

14:13.553 --> 14:18.323
      - She is expecting.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.391
       - Sam is pregnant?
             - Oh!

14:20.393 --> 14:23.061
   - We're gonna have a baby?

           from this.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.568
          Okay, what--
    what are you doing now?

14:30.570 --> 14:33.037
   - I'm looking for tampons.
             - Why?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.540
   - Because women don't need
 tampons when they're pregnant.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.975
   - Oh, yeah, 'cause that's
    the first thing women do

14:36.977 --> 14:39.911
        They chuck away
       all their tampons.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.880
        - You know what?
 I'm so freaked out right now.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.648
    Can we just stop talking
    about tampons for once?

14:43.650 --> 14:45.550
            - Okay.
      - Okay, okay, okay.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.087
             Just--
           all right.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.456

14:54.361 --> 14:56.361
       I can't--I can't--

14:58.597 --> 15:02.567
       Is there any world

15:02.569 --> 15:04.569
            In which
     I'm equipped for this?

15:08.340 --> 15:09.340

15:22.989 --> 15:25.590
        This right here
          is a hammer.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.091
     Yeah, and it's heavy.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.227
      Yes, it makes a lot
        of loud noises,

15:29.229 --> 15:32.664
   And, yes, a hammer injury
        is a valid fear,

15:32.666 --> 15:36.567
    But it is time to cross
    that fear off your list.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.305
   There's no pressure here,
   but I need you to do this,

15:40.307 --> 15:43.942
   Because if I can teach you
    how to hammer in a nail,

15:43.944 --> 15:48.279
 Then maybe in some crazy way,

15:48.281 --> 15:52.083
    It means I really can do
    the whole father thing.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.186
            - Okay.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.121

16:00.961 --> 16:02.694
        Oh, it's, uh...

16:02.696 --> 16:04.963
           - [sighs]
 - it's heavier than it looks.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.332
      This thing's kind of
    a death stick, isn't it?

16:07.334 --> 16:10.702
        - You can do it.
        I know you can.

16:10.704 --> 16:14.605

16:14.607 --> 16:16.341

16:34.194 --> 16:36.527
 - It's really bleeding, will.
            - Fiona!

16:36.529 --> 16:38.029
       - I'm not so good
          with blood.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.630
         - I'm with you
     less than ten minutes,

16:39.632 --> 16:42.667
   - I'm gonna lose my thumb?
       - No, no, almost.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.135
  You almost lose your thumb.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.437
      Okay, I'm gonna call
          your doctor.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.706

She's not gonna pick up my call.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.210
    I alienate your doctor,

16:52.212 --> 16:54.345

  What kind of father is that?

16:55.782 --> 16:57.782

        before my eyes.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.650
      You're in it a lot.
  - Where's the first-aid kit?

16:59.652 --> 17:03.588

        - Like a bitch.
            - What?

17:13.633 --> 17:15.700
          - All right,
     here comes the agony,

17:15.702 --> 17:18.435
   But if it hurts too much,
you punch me in the face, okay?

17:18.438 --> 17:21.439
I've always found pain is easier
  to manage when it's shared.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.242
           All right,
         here it comes.

17:25.743 --> 17:28.445

17:31.383 --> 17:33.718
        Good job, dude.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.353
         You took that
          like a man.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.687
         - It did hurt
        like a "b" word,

17:36.689 --> 17:39.590
      But I was physically
   and emotionally prepared.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.093

         to you, okay?

17:42.095 --> 17:43.294

     out of the tree house.

        to worry about.

        - Yeah, let's...

     very used to my life--

     The stuff, the space,
          the freedom.

18:44.224 --> 18:48.659
     And when you moved in,
  I just got scared, you know?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.828
      I got scared that--

18:50.830 --> 18:52.697
       That I would lose
        all that stuff,

18:52.699 --> 18:55.700
   But I shouldn't have been
 focused on what I was losing.

18:55.702 --> 18:59.871
    I should've been focused
  on what I was getting back,

18:59.873 --> 19:04.542
       And being with you
      has changed me, sam.

  I don't want to screw it up.

     to screw it up either.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.491

          to sit down.

    at an academic hospital.
