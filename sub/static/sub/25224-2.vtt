01:28.000 --> 01:31.439
This is ABC11
Eyewitness News at six.

01:31.440 --> 01:35.280
Caitlin Atwater knows
a year can change a life forever.

01:35.281 --> 01:37.120
It's too much to even really say.

01:37.121 --> 01:40.960
One year ago today, her mother,
Kathleen Peterson, died.

01:40.961 --> 01:45.321
At first, Caitlin believed she fell
down the staircase, as she was told.

01:45.322 --> 01:48.521
Now, she believes Michael Peterson
murdered her mother

01:48.522 --> 01:50.961
and she's certain Peterson
will be convicted

01:50.963 --> 01:52.762
in a criminal trial next spring.

01:52.763 --> 01:55.682
Why do you think Michael would
want to kill your mother?

01:55.683 --> 01:57.562
I think that the Michael that I knew

01:57.563 --> 02:00.042
would not want to kill my mom.

02:00.043 --> 02:01.284
I think that...

02:02.644 --> 02:05.243
..I didn't know him
in the way that...

02:05.244 --> 02:08.282
I think that I couldn't
tell you why,

02:08.283 --> 02:10.804
because I didn't know the person
who killed my mom.

02:10.805 --> 02:14.124
You know, that's not who
he held himself out to be.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.044
It doesn't change
any of my memories,

02:16.045 --> 02:19.365
it doesn't change the fact that
I thought they were happy together,

02:19.366 --> 02:21.686
but you don't end up at
the bottom of the stairs...

02:22.966 --> 02:24.885
..under those circumstances

02:24.886 --> 02:28.087
if your life was what
everyone thought it was.

02:33.407 --> 02:37.088
From what we found, every aspect
of Mike Peterson's life is a lie.

02:38.648 --> 02:40.127
He's...

02:40.128 --> 02:42.527
He wasn't wounded in Vietnam.

02:42.528 --> 02:47.288
He obviously served and I'm sure
that he served bravely,

02:47.289 --> 02:52.528
but when he came back from
serving in Vietnam

02:52.529 --> 02:54.528
to Okinawa

02:54.529 --> 02:57.129
and injured in a jeep accident,

02:57.130 --> 03:00.209
he comes back to the States
or wherever he lived -

03:00.210 --> 03:03.449
he told everybody that
he was injured in the war.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.970
That's just absolutely not true.

03:05.971 --> 03:11.970
There's obviously other
aspects of his personality -

03:11.971 --> 03:17.531
he wanted to give the appearance
that this was a wholesome, blended,

03:17.532 --> 03:19.531
functioning family.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.731
That simply is not true.

03:21.732 --> 03:25.052
The evidence is going to show
that he was having

03:25.053 --> 03:27.892
an illicit relationship

03:27.893 --> 03:30.892
that we believe she
likely found out about that,

03:30.893 --> 03:34.693
based upon information that
we found near the computer

03:34.694 --> 03:37.453
and was contained in the computer.

03:37.454 --> 03:40.573
The evidence is going to show
that he is bisexual

03:40.574 --> 03:42.894
and that he was having
a relationship with

03:42.895 --> 03:44.535
a man outside of this county.

03:47.775 --> 03:53.215
We both believe that after she had
a phone call from a person that

03:53.216 --> 03:57.295
worked at Nortel about an upcoming
trip that she was going to take,

03:57.296 --> 04:00.816
that some time,
perhaps after that phone call,

04:00.817 --> 04:04.136
which could have been anywhere
between 10:30 and 11:00,

04:04.137 --> 04:07.776
she discovered this information
on the computer,

04:07.777 --> 04:12.217
which according to the persons
that know her well,

04:12.218 --> 04:15.657
they've told us that, including
most especially her sister,

04:15.658 --> 04:18.338
that she would have been infuriated
by learning that her husband,

04:18.339 --> 04:21.378
who she truly loved,

04:21.379 --> 04:24.898
was bisexual and having an
extramarital relationship,

04:24.899 --> 04:26.698
not with another woman,
but even with a man,

04:26.699 --> 04:30.299
which would be humiliating
and embarrassing to her.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.299
We believe that...

04:32.300 --> 04:36.580
once she learned this information,
that an argument ensued

04:36.581 --> 04:38.181
and the homicide occurred.

04:40.901 --> 04:43.980
Yes, I've known about
the bisexuality

04:43.981 --> 04:46.421
since I was about -
I can't remember -

04:46.422 --> 04:47.702
13 or 14 years old.

04:49.782 --> 04:51.902
And I learned about it
from a friend.

04:53.862 --> 04:55.263
And my parents knew.

04:57.983 --> 05:00.102
And, um...

05:00.103 --> 05:05.183
it's just part of his life
since that time.

05:05.184 --> 05:10.463
I felt from the beginning that the
prosecution was going to go there,

05:10.464 --> 05:14.624
that this would be an important
theme for them.

05:14.625 --> 05:18.504
The reason I believe that
is because,

05:18.505 --> 05:21.584
when they executed
the search warrant,

05:21.585 --> 05:23.065
the police,

05:23.066 --> 05:27.985
the second search warrant - the
first was December 9th, or 10th -

05:27.986 --> 05:31.306
the second was the evening of
the wake the following Wednesday.

05:33.307 --> 05:36.266
They were here for several hours
and then they left,

05:36.267 --> 05:37.587
but when they left...

05:38.587 --> 05:41.467
..the house and we came back
into the house,

05:41.468 --> 05:42.788
they left a picture...

05:44.508 --> 05:46.387
..on a table in the den.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.787
The table was completely clean,

05:48.788 --> 05:51.308
nothing on it except one picture.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.508
The picture was from his computer,
which they had taken.

05:54.509 --> 05:57.108
They had downloaded or
printed off this picture

05:57.109 --> 05:59.269
and it was pornographic.

05:59.270 --> 06:02.029
It was a message,
I knew that was a message,

06:02.030 --> 06:03.989
that they left it there on purpose

06:03.990 --> 06:06.829
so that we would see it
and we would find it

06:06.830 --> 06:10.870
and what the message was
to me and to him -

06:10.871 --> 06:14.351
"We know what you're like,
we know this secret life of yours.

06:16.351 --> 06:19.832
"We don't like it and we're going
to do something about it."

06:22.712 --> 06:24.552
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

06:29.553 --> 06:33.072
I was looking at here, dealing
with photographs that were taken

06:33.073 --> 06:38.393
from his computer and most of them
are homosexual military men.

06:38.394 --> 06:40.833
They're all different types of
things that they're doing,

06:40.834 --> 06:42.753
multiple partners,

06:42.754 --> 06:46.114
but they're all portrayed as being

06:46.115 --> 06:47.475
gay military men...

06:48.475 --> 06:50.675
..performing sexual acts
on each other.

06:52.795 --> 06:54.955
And part of, um...

06:54.956 --> 06:59.955
One of the persons that we believe
he had had a relationship with,

06:59.956 --> 07:01.116
um...

07:02.316 --> 07:06.476
..we believe he met this person
from a website that once again

07:06.477 --> 07:10.516
was designed for homosexual
military men and this individual

07:10.517 --> 07:14.477
that has been interviewed
and that we know about...

07:14.478 --> 07:17.437
that we believe had some type
of relationship with Mr Peterson

07:17.438 --> 07:22.518
contemporaneous with the time period
that we've been talking about,

07:22.519 --> 07:24.239
he fits right into this mould.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.718
It's not the type of thing
your typical, average juror

07:28.719 --> 07:31.759
or typical, average citizen
would want to access,

07:31.760 --> 07:34.359
nor would want to play out
in their personal lives.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.839
Not if they want
to portray themselves

07:36.840 --> 07:39.559
as someone that has
this perfect marriage,

07:39.560 --> 07:42.561
or however he wants to make
his life seem so perfect...

07:44.321 --> 07:45.640
..with his wife.

07:45.641 --> 07:48.120
But it's obviously very...

07:48.121 --> 07:52.042
powerful information
that he wants kept from...

07:53.082 --> 07:56.042
..the public, in particular,
but certainly the jury.

07:57.282 --> 08:00.843
Because it could be very damaging,
from a lot of perspectives.

08:10.884 --> 08:13.083
You got his statement?
Mm-hm. What did he say?

08:13.084 --> 08:15.964
He said you had sex with him.
Oh, you're shitting me!

08:18.445 --> 08:20.364
Four or five times.

08:20.365 --> 08:21.844
Where?!

08:21.845 --> 08:23.684
Uh, I don't know all the details,

08:23.685 --> 08:26.165
cos I was skimming through
all the stuff

08:26.166 --> 08:27.565
and when I came to his...

08:27.566 --> 08:29.765
You're kidding me! Unh-unh.

08:29.766 --> 08:31.366
That's what he's claiming.

08:32.566 --> 08:34.845
PETERSON SIGHS
That's what he's claiming.

08:34.846 --> 08:37.486
HE CHUCKLES

08:37.486 --> 08:39.285
Oh, my God.
Everybody wants a piece of you.

08:39.287 --> 08:41.885
Jesus Christ!

08:41.886 --> 08:44.006
Or everybody claims to have
a piece of you.

08:44.006 --> 08:45.048
One of the two.

08:46.328 --> 08:48.527
And you have a statement? Yeah.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.127
We copied it. Send me a copy of that
statement, I'm dying to see that.

08:52.128 --> 08:53.407
I'll get it tomorrow.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.848
Was it a short statement,
a long statement?

08:55.849 --> 08:57.768
About a page and a half. OK.

08:57.769 --> 08:59.088
Handwritten.

08:59.089 --> 09:00.649
Handwritten? OK.

09:03.290 --> 09:05.849
He didn't indicate where this
great love affair took place?

09:05.850 --> 09:08.410
Yeah, but, Mike,
I cannot remember it.

09:09.810 --> 09:12.170
Rather know now than later.
I'll say.

09:12.171 --> 09:13.450
God, I'll say, for sure.

09:13.451 --> 09:16.530
So I talked to Dave about Denis
and we're going to rethink,

09:16.531 --> 09:18.450
we're going to digest the statements

09:18.451 --> 09:20.730
and then rethink as
to how to approach it.

09:20.731 --> 09:23.251
OK, all right.

09:23.252 --> 09:25.011
Jesus, right.

09:25.012 --> 09:26.532
God.

09:29.132 --> 09:30.732
Hmm.

09:30.733 --> 09:32.612
OK, well...

09:32.613 --> 09:35.493
if you say "relationships",
that would mean...

09:36.573 --> 09:39.253
That would imply more than...

09:40.294 --> 09:42.134
..sex, for instance.

09:43.334 --> 09:46.933
And that never happened.
I'm a very...

09:46.934 --> 09:49.854
I'm not that multifaceted

09:49.855 --> 09:53.614
that I could have more
than one relationship.

09:53.615 --> 09:57.855
I'm a monogamous person in the sense
that I don't... There was Kathleen.

09:57.856 --> 09:59.336
She took up my whole life.

10:01.376 --> 10:04.415
Could I have sex? Yes.

10:04.416 --> 10:06.295
That could exist,

10:06.296 --> 10:12.096
but not a relationship,
I could not go to dinner or have...

10:12.097 --> 10:17.577
No, it would be inconceivable, that,
because she fulfilled all of that

10:17.578 --> 10:21.577
and actually fulfilled...
certainly sexual,

10:21.578 --> 10:25.418
but there was this other aspect

10:25.419 --> 10:28.019
of me that just existed...

10:29.619 --> 10:31.059
..and I...

10:33.339 --> 10:35.300
..yes, did have sex.

11:08.023 --> 11:10.343
No injuries to Mike Peterson -
good fact.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.943
Search of vehicles finds
nothing - good fact.

11:14.944 --> 11:17.344
And what else?
And number of lacerations.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.224
Good relationship between
Mike and Kathleen.

11:21.225 --> 11:26.504
Bad - imprecise statement from
Mike Peterson about what happened.

11:26.505 --> 11:28.344
Good - no motive at all.

11:28.345 --> 11:30.265
Well, that's not a fact. Well, OK.

11:30.266 --> 11:32.585
"No intimate" says bad marriage.

11:32.586 --> 11:36.826
That's true, and no affairs,
no current affairs. No intimate...

11:38.506 --> 11:40.946
Good fact - apparent
happiness that evening.

11:40.947 --> 11:45.546
Bad fact - Mike ignoring
911 operator's questions.

11:45.547 --> 11:47.866
Good fact - he called two times.

11:47.867 --> 11:51.667
Right. Bad fact -
he said she was breathing.

11:51.668 --> 11:54.827
First call.
Good fact - said she was breathing.

11:54.828 --> 11:56.348
He said she was breathing.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.148
Good and bad? Yeah.

11:59.149 --> 12:01.749
Bad - e-mails.
What does this mean, e-mails?

12:03.349 --> 12:04.789
Gay e-mails.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.710
Bad - affair during marriage.

12:09.910 --> 12:11.429
Gay affair.

12:11.430 --> 12:15.469
Bad - nobody knew about the
bisexuality. Bisexuality hidden.

12:15.470 --> 12:17.110
Good fact - she knew.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.590
Who can testify that she knew?

12:19.591 --> 12:21.270
She knew what?

12:21.271 --> 12:26.031
Who is the witness that can say that
she knew that he was bisexual. Mike.

12:26.032 --> 12:29.071
Anybody besides Mike? Yes, Todd.

12:29.072 --> 12:31.711
Todd and Mike are
the only two people.

12:31.712 --> 12:34.112
That is a negative,
negative, negative.

12:34.113 --> 12:37.273
That is a big, huge
negative, I think.

12:38.273 --> 12:40.472
Is there anybody in this
room that believes

12:40.473 --> 12:42.832
that she probably didn't know?

12:42.833 --> 12:45.553
Let's go back to the truth
for a second, reality.

12:45.554 --> 12:47.913
The relationship was
a beautiful relationship

12:47.914 --> 12:50.793
and a loving relationship
and I think we can prove it.

12:50.794 --> 12:55.994
We know that there is a bisexual
hidden life here, we know that.

12:55.995 --> 12:57.514
Is it possible...?

12:57.515 --> 13:00.074
I'm sitting there as a juror -
is it possible

13:00.075 --> 13:02.995
that a marriage can
function that way

13:02.996 --> 13:08.355
and the answer is, it can, and
marriages do function that way.

13:08.356 --> 13:12.636
Do you think that merely
because he was bisexual

13:12.637 --> 13:16.036
would make it more likely
to you that he would murder?

13:16.037 --> 13:17.516
That's the right question.

13:17.517 --> 13:19.356
What the state is trying to do here

13:19.357 --> 13:21.997
is prejudice the jury
against this guy. Right.

13:21.998 --> 13:25.237
It's got nothing to do with the
evidence of guilt or innocence

13:25.238 --> 13:27.437
in this case, because
they want to attack him

13:27.438 --> 13:29.318
for his personal lifestyle
or what have you.

13:29.319 --> 13:32.318
If that's all you've got, folks,
if that's all the state's got,

13:32.319 --> 13:34.678
we know you're going
to acquit in this case.

13:34.679 --> 13:37.518
Let's assume that all this
bad stuff comes in -

13:37.519 --> 13:39.919
we've got to ask ourselves,

13:39.920 --> 13:45.039
what can Mike do to counteract that
versus making it worse?

13:45.040 --> 13:48.920
I think that if all he's going
to do is get out and say,

13:48.921 --> 13:52.320
"I wasn't having an affair at the
time and she knew I was bisexual,"

13:52.321 --> 13:55.720
that will not have any
credibility at all.

13:55.721 --> 14:01.681
My approach has always been, I'm not
going to put my client on the stand

14:01.682 --> 14:05.802
unless it becomes
absolutely essential,

14:05.803 --> 14:09.962
unless there is something he can do

14:09.963 --> 14:13.642
that I have to have done
that I can't do myself,

14:13.643 --> 14:17.283
unless I'm convinced that
we're going to lose the case

14:17.284 --> 14:18.803
unless he gets on the stand.

14:18.804 --> 14:22.563
I think Mike can come across
pretty well on direct.

14:22.564 --> 14:25.004
Whether he stands up to cross
is a different issue,

14:25.005 --> 14:27.004
but I think he can be taught on that

14:27.005 --> 14:30.644
and some of the bad stuff we
may have to deal with anyway.

14:30.645 --> 14:35.805
Mike gets on the witness stand
and a good cross-examiner

14:35.806 --> 14:40.645
is going to be able to make
his actions seem unreasonable.

14:40.646 --> 14:43.886
And once he gets on the stand too,
they can start bringing up

14:43.887 --> 14:46.886
to impeach him, can't they,
all the stuff about the...

14:46.887 --> 14:48.206
Oh, God, let's get into that.

14:48.207 --> 14:51.607
That, "Sir, you don't always
tell the truth, do you?"

14:54.488 --> 14:56.327
"I try to."

14:56.328 --> 15:01.328
"I understand you try to, but
sometimes, when it doesn't suit you,

15:01.329 --> 15:03.848
"you lie about certain things,
don't you?"

15:03.849 --> 15:06.408
"What do you mean by that?"

15:06.409 --> 15:09.368
You know? "Well, for example,
your mayoral race.

15:09.369 --> 15:12.489
"It wouldn't have helped you
very much to admit

15:12.490 --> 15:17.009
"that you had actually gotten your
injuries in a car accident, right?

15:17.010 --> 15:19.890
"In a book jacket, you painted
yourself as having gotten

15:19.891 --> 15:21.971
"these injuries in Vietnam, right?"

15:23.091 --> 15:26.450
"This is true." "And you kept that
lie going for years, didn't you?

15:26.451 --> 15:27.890
"Right?"

15:27.891 --> 15:30.371
Without Michael on the stand,

15:30.372 --> 15:33.091
whatever gay stuff gets in,

15:33.092 --> 15:37.611
I can argue they have
so little real evidence here

15:37.613 --> 15:40.532
that they're getting into
his private sex life.

15:40.533 --> 15:42.333
Even if we have to concede it...

15:44.173 --> 15:46.332
..what does it have to do...?

15:46.333 --> 15:49.213
I can sort of get into it
as gay bashing.

15:49.214 --> 15:52.253
You know? And sort of...
Yeah, I like it.

15:52.254 --> 15:56.894
As opposed to it becoming
a credibility thing

15:56.895 --> 16:03.054
with Michael having to admit, "Yeah,
I've had homosexual relationships,

16:03.055 --> 16:04.974
"but not with him."

16:04.975 --> 16:06.775
What good does that do us?

16:06.776 --> 16:08.935
Michael's the only one who can deny

16:08.936 --> 16:12.935
an active current homosexual
relationship. You know what?

16:12.936 --> 16:15.576
THEY TALK OVER ONE ANOTHER

16:15.577 --> 16:17.376
Oh, my God, come on.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.896
His denial will have no credibility.

16:19.897 --> 16:24.618
We have to suppress...
Let's talk about that for a second.

16:26.498 --> 16:30.777
"Mr Peterson, you claim that Denis
Rowe is lying, making this up?

16:30.778 --> 16:32.377
"Is that what you're saying?

16:32.378 --> 16:34.258
"Well, Denis Rowe didn't make up

16:34.259 --> 16:37.218
"those e-mails on your computer,
did he?"

16:37.219 --> 16:39.218
"No, but those e-mails..."

16:39.219 --> 16:41.738
"Sir, my question was, Denis Rowe

16:41.739 --> 16:44.779
"didn't make up those e-mails,
did he?

16:44.780 --> 16:46.859
"You wrote those e-mails, did you?"
"I did."

16:46.860 --> 16:49.579
"You wrote the e-mails
saying you wanted to suck

16:49.580 --> 16:51.900
"so-and-so's dick, didn't you?"
"No, no."

16:51.901 --> 16:54.060
"Are there e-mails saying that?"
"Yes, sir."

16:54.061 --> 16:56.140
"To two different people,
Brad and..."

16:56.141 --> 16:57.461
"Have you forgotten?"

16:58.581 --> 17:01.461
"Didn't you want to suck their
dicks?" Can we take a moment?

17:01.462 --> 17:04.181
Yeah.
LAUGHTER

17:04.182 --> 17:06.502
Did you have to swallow hard?

17:19.983 --> 17:23.384
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

17:34.305 --> 17:36.824
Can you say for him

17:36.825 --> 17:39.986
what your goals are
for this session? Yeah.

17:41.266 --> 17:47.186
And certainly, if things come up in
terms of testimony that David wants

17:47.187 --> 17:51.506
to spend time with, he may veer in
a million different directions,

17:51.507 --> 17:55.386
but just in terms of us together
and using this time for the space

17:55.388 --> 17:57.947
and configurations of the courtroom.

17:57.948 --> 18:04.187
Yeah, I'm not so interested, Mike,
in particular substance right now.

18:04.188 --> 18:09.988
What I'm really interested in is
getting you up in a witness chair,

18:09.989 --> 18:12.468
talking with a jury

18:12.469 --> 18:17.189
and not going into some role

18:17.190 --> 18:20.309
that's designed to shield

18:20.310 --> 18:22.149
what's inside. OK.

18:22.150 --> 18:26.190
What I'm hoping is that the role
you play up on the jury...

18:26.191 --> 18:30.671
up in the witness box is the role
that you played with Kathleen...

18:32.712 --> 18:36.231
..in terms of just who you are.

18:36.232 --> 18:42.592
I want the jury to see the same
person that Kathleen saw.

18:42.593 --> 18:46.872
OK, you sing around the house
to yourself, don't you?

18:46.873 --> 18:49.152
I thought I heard you... Hum.

18:49.153 --> 18:52.553
Hum. I hum. What's a song you hum?

18:52.554 --> 18:56.274
I don't think it is a song,
I just hum. What's a song you know?

18:57.754 --> 18:59.755
Look for a way in, not a way out.

19:00.955 --> 19:03.834
It is a sort of a dum-dee-dee,
dee-dee-dee.

19:03.835 --> 19:05.834
It used to be Kathleen's joke -

19:05.835 --> 19:09.315

about your sex life, my friend,

so just let's get some... That
might be easier than singing it.

I slit a sheet.

20:13.843 --> 20:15.642

20:15.643 --> 20:17.122
A sheet I slit.

20:17.123 --> 20:19.562
Upon a slitted sheet, I sit.

20:19.563 --> 20:21.762
Upon a slitted sheet, I sit.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.924
I slit a sheet, a sheet I slit,
upon a slitted sheet I sit.

Don't protect yourself.

20:28.044 --> 20:31.283
I slit a sheet, a sheet I slit,
upon a slitted sheet I sit.

20:31.284 --> 20:35.964
Do it, please. I shut a sleet, a
sheet, I sat upon the slitted sheet.

20:35.965 --> 20:39.764
Now, I slit a sheet, a sheet I slit,
upon a slitted sheet I sit.

20:39.765 --> 20:41.605
I shit a sleet.

20:41.606 --> 20:43.365
Good, and that's just the deal.

20:43.366 --> 20:46.205
You may misspeak,
a word like shit may come out,

20:46.206 --> 20:47.925
you may make a mistake.

20:47.926 --> 20:50.046
Big deal.

20:50.047 --> 20:52.526
Mr Peterson, I want
to read you something

20:52.527 --> 20:56.847
and I'm going to ask you after
you've heard it if you recognise it.

20:58.807 --> 21:01.408
"Did your friend die for anything?"

21:02.888 --> 21:07.727
"I hope so, if only because there is
something in him that lives in you.

21:07.728 --> 21:11.289
"Every man who dies can
live on in us."

21:18.130 --> 21:19.450
I think I wrote that.

21:20.810 --> 21:22.090
I hope I did.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.931
Do you believe it to be true,
as you sit here today? Yes.

21:30.931 --> 21:36.171
What parts of Kathleen
live on in you?

21:36.172 --> 21:37.412
Mm...

21:49.253 --> 21:52.332
Good. We don't need to hear
the answer now... OK.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.614
..just your willingness
to go there...

21:59.054 --> 22:00.693
..was enough.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.814
Good.

22:06.015 --> 22:09.894
OK, Mr Peterson,
you're under oath, correct? Yes.

22:09.895 --> 22:12.414
And you expect this jury
to believe you.

22:12.415 --> 22:16.535
Yes. Treat you
as an honest person. Yes.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.935
But the truth is, there have been
times in your life where

22:19.936 --> 22:22.257
you have lied because it
has benefitted you.

22:28.017 --> 22:29.736
I...

22:29.737 --> 22:32.337
would say probably that's
a good characterisation,

22:32.338 --> 22:33.618
although I might say...

22:35.378 --> 22:39.778
..it's easier. It was just easier
sometimes, to let the lie...

22:41.579 --> 22:43.778
..come out.

22:43.779 --> 22:47.738
And for example, now,
you married Tricia Peterson in 1966,

22:47.739 --> 22:50.299
isn't that correct? Correct.

22:50.300 --> 22:54.859
And during your marriage,
you had a number of affairs.

22:54.860 --> 22:59.460
Yes. They were not all women,
were they? No.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.140
And you did continue to
have affairs,

23:02.141 --> 23:04.740
even after your relationship
with Kathleen began?

23:04.741 --> 23:09.901
That's a word...
Affairs, to me, mean... Sex.

23:09.902 --> 23:12.542
How do you describe,
one incident or affairs?

23:13.822 --> 23:17.062
You have... The word "affairs"
is confusing to you?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.302
Yes.

23:18.303 --> 23:21.022
Let's make it simple then, sir
- you had sex with

23:21.023 --> 23:24.862
other people after your relationship
with Kathleen began?

23:24.863 --> 23:28.743
That's correct. Men?
That's correct. And women?

23:28.744 --> 23:30.823
No. Just men? Yes.

23:30.824 --> 23:32.543
So, now, this was different
from when

23:32.544 --> 23:34.264
you were married
to Patty Peterson.

23:36.065 --> 23:39.985
Yes. OK. In fact, you never talked
about that with Kathleen.

23:43.905 --> 23:45.825
Well, we did talk about...

23:45.826 --> 23:48.465
That you were having sex with other
men during the marriage?

23:48.466 --> 23:51.145
In the sense that yes,
she understood that.

23:51.146 --> 23:55.026
She understood it was with men?
Oh, yes.

23:55.027 --> 23:58.506
I think there was enough awareness
on her part of me

23:58.507 --> 24:00.786
as a person and who I was.

24:00.787 --> 24:04.307
Which is what made this
relationship so good.

24:04.308 --> 24:07.187
That, yes,
she understood these aspects

24:07.188 --> 24:11.467
about me and was not bothered by
that, because I loved her.

24:11.468 --> 24:14.548
That, yes,
I did have sex with other people,

24:14.549 --> 24:20.268
but that had absolutely nothing to
do with not loving Kathleen or...

24:20.269 --> 24:21.910
loving her less.

24:23.150 --> 24:24.229
Mike, what do you think?

24:24.230 --> 24:26.069
How are you feeling
compared to, say,

24:26.070 --> 24:28.829
what we did earlier in the office?

24:28.830 --> 24:32.990
I would have no clue.
Honestly? Honestly.

24:32.991 --> 24:36.270
My sense is that you are
not parsing,

24:36.271 --> 24:42.151
you are not trying to win
on any technicalities... No.

24:42.152 --> 24:45.271
I saw nobody who was being tricky,

24:45.272 --> 24:48.752
someone who assumed responsibility
and someone who within the...

24:48.753 --> 24:51.112
No, and I told you this, guys,
from the beginning.

24:51.113 --> 24:53.592
My ass, life, totally is
in your hands, and I know that,

24:53.593 --> 24:57.152
and I'm not going to outsmart you,
I'm not going to outsmart Hardin,

24:57.153 --> 25:01.273
outsmart anybody,
and I'm going to tell you.

25:01.274 --> 25:05.833
At one point you actually even
leaned into the wind, physically.

25:05.834 --> 25:09.114
Mmm. And it was a cold wind,
so I thought,

25:09.115 --> 25:10.715
"OK, he's going to be fine."

25:28.877 --> 25:33.357
Hey. Hey. We're late.
That's fine, that's fine.

25:34.517 --> 25:35.798
All right.

25:43.358 --> 25:47.878
Hey. Number one, I want to talk
about additional survey stuff,

25:47.879 --> 25:55.479
to give us more insight and what I
would call triggers, key questions.

25:55.480 --> 25:59.359
So... Well, how do you approach
the bisexuality issue?

25:59.360 --> 26:00.959
Since we didn't do it last time.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.800
For the reasons you expressed. Seems
like that reason still applies.

26:03.801 --> 26:07.280
We're not doing it,
but it's a big issue in the case.

26:07.281 --> 26:09.880
You would hide it in
a list of questions, like,

26:09.881 --> 26:13.201
"What are your views
about heterosexuals?"

26:13.202 --> 26:14.481
You'd have a whole list of...

26:14.482 --> 26:16.521
I really think probably we're
going to have to pick

26:16.522 --> 26:19.641
a topic like marriage. Right.

26:19.642 --> 26:24.402
What are the kind of reasons, what
can be accepted within a marriage?

26:24.403 --> 26:27.242
That kind of thing,
rather than just go on the issue.

26:27.243 --> 26:29.562
No, but I do think we're going
to need to

26:29.563 --> 26:32.043
find out their attitude
towards homosexuality.

26:32.044 --> 26:34.443
Well, we will,
or we could do it that way.

26:34.444 --> 26:36.843
And then you've got to ask
it of at least

26:36.844 --> 26:41.244
400, 500 people to have
a statistically meaningful sample,

26:41.245 --> 26:46.524
and so, we're talking about
a significant expenditure,

26:46.525 --> 26:50.685
but in my mind, if you were
choosing between this

26:50.686 --> 26:53.805
and a mock trial in this case,
I'd choose this.

26:53.806 --> 26:56.165
A survey,
and then analysing the data,

26:56.166 --> 26:58.406
and then coming up with
some conclusions,

26:58.407 --> 27:00.406
which is going to cost what?

27:00.407 --> 27:04.607
It's probably going to be in the
35,000, 40,000 range. OK.

27:07.808 --> 27:11.407
So that's a total of, like, cash we
have to come up with

27:11.408 --> 27:16.048
to carry this case through trial,
of 385,000. That's...

27:16.049 --> 27:18.728
Look, you guys are
spending the money,

27:18.729 --> 27:21.648
and Mike, it's your life...
Right.

27:21.649 --> 27:25.129
..but I'm just telling you that
sometimes what you find out

27:25.130 --> 27:29.409
is intuitive, and sometimes what you
find out is counterintuitive.

27:29.410 --> 27:33.649
And it's the counterintuitive stuff
that you just would never know.

27:33.650 --> 27:37.490
You find out one thing that's
counterintuitive in that survey...

27:37.491 --> 27:39.890
Mm-hmm... for 35,000,

27:39.891 --> 27:42.090
and it's mighty cheap.

27:42.091 --> 27:47.331
It's mighty cheap, when you stack it
up against the rest of your life.

27:47.332 --> 27:52.292
Mm-hmm. OK.
We have our... schedule down.

28:02.454 --> 28:07.533
So what we're going to have, it's
going to cost six-five, six-seven,

28:07.534 --> 28:12.774
700... We know for a fact,
between 750,000 to 800,000.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.014
HE DROPS PEN ON TABLE

28:14.015 --> 28:17.214
I think we were originally
thinking 500, 550,

28:17.215 --> 28:19.374
something like that.

28:19.375 --> 28:23.295
So that's cost us another 250.
300,000 more.

28:23.296 --> 28:25.295
Over budget. Over budget.

28:25.296 --> 28:28.096
If we were a business,
we'd be out of business.

28:29.257 --> 28:33.976
Then again, what do people do who
don't have money?

28:33.977 --> 28:35.936
"The rich get off."

28:35.937 --> 28:38.737
Well, that's the only reason
the rich get off,

28:38.738 --> 28:40.617
because they can afford to
defend themselves.

28:40.618 --> 28:42.977
The damn poor go to jail because
they can't afford

28:42.978 --> 28:45.577
to defend themselves - period.

28:45.578 --> 28:48.938
I mean, not in every case of course.
But that's pretty much it.

28:48.939 --> 28:50.698
What would somebody do in my case?

28:50.699 --> 28:54.658
First off, they wouldn't have
prosecuted like this,

28:54.659 --> 28:56.058
but the other thing is,

28:56.059 --> 28:59.179
they'd be hopeless.
Hopeless, in hiring experts.

28:59.180 --> 29:02.819
For somebody to come in and prove
that, "No, this didn't happen."

29:02.820 --> 29:05.539
Yeah, I think the state budgets
and allocates a certain amount,

29:05.540 --> 29:07.060
but it's nowhere near.

29:07.061 --> 29:11.781
No, nothing. Yeah, yeah,
the American justice is...

29:13.221 --> 29:15.262
..very, very expensive.

29:25.423 --> 29:29.263
At the end of this light, this is
the end of the white neighbourhood.

29:31.463 --> 29:35.624
All up in here, everything is white,
everybody is white.

29:42.905 --> 29:46.985
And then starting across this
street, everything is black.

29:49.585 --> 29:54.585
This is the biggest scandal
in Durham, right here.

29:54.586 --> 29:59.025
They've put in millions of dollars
to build these houses

29:59.026 --> 30:03.626
that they were going to be for poor
people, and it's just crooked,

30:03.627 --> 30:06.546
and it was never developed
of course,

30:06.547 --> 30:12.787
the houses are not occupied,
it's in bankruptcy.

30:12.788 --> 30:15.267
They built these apartments
- look at that.

30:15.268 --> 30:16.987
These are only a few years ago.

30:16.988 --> 30:21.389
They're falling apart.
They're just, it's just a travesty.

30:22.829 --> 30:25.308
And it's a beautiful -
as you can see -

30:25.309 --> 30:27.628
it's a beautiful piece of property.

30:27.629 --> 30:30.710
It overlooks the city.
This is one of the nicest areas.

30:32.110 --> 30:35.629
This is the story of Durham -
promises and promises,

30:35.630 --> 30:39.151
and corruption, and theft.

30:41.471 --> 30:43.031
And lies.

30:47.272 --> 30:50.671
When I came to Durham for
the first time,

30:50.672 --> 30:53.591
in 1961, over 40 years ago,

30:53.592 --> 30:59.152
I just couldn't believe that
blacks couldn't go to school

30:59.153 --> 31:03.112
with white people,
they couldn't eat in restaurants,

31:03.113 --> 31:09.233
they were not much better
than in slavery times.

31:09.234 --> 31:14.754
And after 40 years, there are
definitely some rich blacks,

31:14.755 --> 31:20.314
and certainly society has gotten
better, but in many regards,

31:20.315 --> 31:24.675
it's just as bad,
and in some cases, it's worse...

31:24.676 --> 31:26.156
than it ever was.

31:27.436 --> 31:29.356
And all we do in this town is...

31:30.876 --> 31:34.397
..not deal with the real problems.

31:36.117 --> 31:38.997
The real problems are
crime, drugs, ignorance.

31:41.717 --> 31:45.918
And nobody wants to talk about that.
I find that, for instance...

31:47.518 --> 31:53.078
..in my case, every day, my God,

31:53.079 --> 31:55.558
pounds of newsprint, ink, paper,

31:55.559 --> 32:00.839
all the media,
everybody is focused on my trial.

32:00.840 --> 32:04.919
It's a diversion, it's something,
it's an entertainment,

32:04.920 --> 32:07.359
it's a show, and if one tenth,

32:07.360 --> 32:14.440
ONE TENTH of that amount of time
or media exposure,

32:14.441 --> 32:18.760
if it were given to what's real
and what's true,

32:18.761 --> 32:22.401
the problems,
things would get better.

32:22.402 --> 32:25.361
It was four years ago, 1999.

32:25.362 --> 32:29.162
I was writing about Rolling Hills,
that place we just saw,

32:29.163 --> 32:33.002
I was starting with that.

32:33.003 --> 32:35.243
It's mostly about corruption.

32:39.404 --> 32:43.363
"Cops solve 5% of crimes. Why?"

32:43.364 --> 32:46.644
"Despite an onslaught of publicity
on how crime is down,

32:46.645 --> 32:48.924
"streets are safer,
drug traffic reduced,

32:48.925 --> 32:53.604
"one figure remains truly alarming
- the clearance rate of crime.

32:53.605 --> 32:57.165
"Police solve about 5% of
reported crimes,

32:57.166 --> 33:00.766
"while ticket collection is,
by comparison, an impressive 33%."

33:03.606 --> 33:07.926
Then there's this one.
I didn't attack the DA very often.

33:07.927 --> 33:12.046
And it says, basically, "The DA's
got a hard thing for bingo,

33:12.047 --> 33:16.527
"so he sends the cops out to close
down the bingo parlours. Why?

33:16.528 --> 33:19.807
"Because he can't get anybody for
anything else.

33:19.808 --> 33:23.288
"My God, there's more crime in
City Hall than in southern Italy.

33:23.289 --> 33:26.168
"The DA and cops can't catch
any real criminals

33:26.169 --> 33:30.808
"in City Hall, so they go after
underage voters and bingo players."

33:30.809 --> 33:34.849
So it was just a commentary and
I didn't attack him personally,

33:34.850 --> 33:37.329
I didn't say anything negative
about his personal life,

33:37.330 --> 33:40.009
I don't know anything about his
personal life and I never

33:40.010 --> 33:43.330
would say anything about anybody's
personal life anyway,

33:43.331 --> 33:47.970
but everybody knows - and I should
have certainly known better

33:47.971 --> 33:51.691
- that when you make fun of people,
they don't like it,

33:51.692 --> 33:54.371
it's just that simple.

33:54.372 --> 33:59.132
And, eh, if you make them look silly
or ridiculous, they remember that.

34:12.373 --> 34:15.293
Speed it up...

34:21.655 --> 34:25.415
Pants are 34, shirt's 33.

34:42.137 --> 34:46.897
This is on top of the blood smears
and blood spatter.

34:46.898 --> 34:50.178
That's basically the last one.

34:52.338 --> 34:56.938
And here, this
has to be after the urine deposit.

34:56.938 --> 35:04.259
Smaller ones,
1mm to approximately 4mm.

35:04.260 --> 35:08.300
Three inches by two-and-a-half inch.

35:10.940 --> 35:16.061
Blood spatter, radial, out from
the centre.

35:23.622 --> 35:27.181
See now, I looked at those and
I thought, OK, bloody pants.

35:27.182 --> 35:30.141
I would have spent three minutes
looking at them.

35:30.142 --> 35:33.743
But Henry's a whole different story.

35:37.543 --> 35:40.462
You can see, these blood stains,

35:40.463 --> 35:43.663
basically you have
multiple deposits.

35:43.664 --> 35:45.863
You have blood spatter
underneath it,

35:45.864 --> 35:48.743
you have under blood stain and you
have additional blood stain.

35:48.744 --> 35:54.664
That tells me it's not coming out
one time, it's multiple deposits.

35:54.665 --> 35:57.664
And that's consistent with what
Werner is saying,

35:57.665 --> 36:01.225
about the fact that she wouldn't
have lost consciousness

36:01.226 --> 36:03.225
for some extended period of time?

36:03.226 --> 36:09.546
She has to be conscious, can't get
up or sit up, with the moving...

36:09.547 --> 36:15.186
So the pants themselves can tell us
the story,

36:15.187 --> 36:17.787
she was up.

36:17.788 --> 36:22.427
And there was time...
Half-an-hour time lag in between.

36:22.428 --> 36:27.348
So essentially you got less blood on
the bottom than here.

36:27.349 --> 36:30.668
Is there any chance that she's on
her knees, slouched over -

36:30.669 --> 36:35.308
because there's more blood on this
side than there is on that side -

36:35.309 --> 36:38.109
against the wall?

36:38.110 --> 36:40.429
This person probably just put the,

36:40.430 --> 36:44.909
when they initially put the towel,
maybe her body was up here.

36:44.910 --> 36:46.430
I'm sure that's right.

36:46.431 --> 36:48.230
Do you see what I mean, Ron?

36:48.231 --> 36:51.391
That's the position when they took
the picture. Right.

37:03.593 --> 37:07.712
We have to look at the scientific
fact and base

37:07.713 --> 37:10.752
our interpretation purely on the
scientific fact.

37:10.753 --> 37:14.153
The first thing,
I look at the scene,

37:14.154 --> 37:18.513
I notice there a tremendous amount
of blood spatter.

37:18.514 --> 37:23.554
Ordinary beating up scene, we don't
see that much blood spatter.

37:23.555 --> 37:25.634
The second thing I notice,

37:25.635 --> 37:30.514
all of those blood spatter come from
different directions.

37:30.515 --> 37:36.115
If you're beating in the same
direction and repetitively,

37:36.116 --> 37:40.836
in theory, we should see most of the
spatter come from one direction,

37:40.837 --> 37:42.316
goes to other direction.

37:42.317 --> 37:45.596
The third area I feel strange is,

37:45.597 --> 37:49.436
I examined the upper wall,
the ceiling, carefully,

37:49.438 --> 37:52.637
inch by inch.
In the staircase area,

37:52.638 --> 37:56.877
I did not see a single blood
spatter on the ceiling

37:56.878 --> 38:00.158
constituting, say, cast-off blood.

38:00.159 --> 38:02.558
Mr Lee seemed to, um,

38:02.559 --> 38:07.598
the only thing he wanted to prove
was that it wasn't a beating.

38:07.599 --> 38:10.879
He never even wanted to consider
that it could be.

38:10.880 --> 38:15.159
Never even wanted to think that it
was possible. Mm-hmm.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.801
He only wanted to prove
that it wasn't.

38:19.481 --> 38:23.360
I personally think Lee was trying
to, was acting like

38:23.361 --> 38:26.441
he was being paid to try and
convince somebody of something.

38:26.442 --> 38:28.681
That's the impression
I got from him.

38:28.682 --> 38:32.281
I thought that Lee, he was terribly
difficult to understand,

38:32.282 --> 38:35.602
and as a result I found
my mind wandering,

38:35.603 --> 38:38.962
so that there
were a lot of questions that

38:38.963 --> 38:42.363
he might have answered,
but I don't remember!

38:44.724 --> 38:48.363
And I felt that he just took the
evidence and stretched it

38:48.364 --> 38:54.364
to fit whatever he needed to
counteract what the defence

38:54.365 --> 38:56.444
was saying.

38:56.445 --> 38:58.284
When I first heard him I thought,

38:58.285 --> 39:01.204
"Man, this guy reminds me of my
junior year calculus teacher."

39:01.205 --> 39:02.884
I couldn't understand him either.

39:02.885 --> 39:04.965
LAUGHTER

39:04.966 --> 39:09.205
But, you know,
I think he's really qualified,

39:09.206 --> 39:11.965
I actually think he really knows
what he's talking about,

39:11.966 --> 39:15.126
but he comes off kind of hokey
because I couldn't understand him,

39:15.127 --> 39:18.526
but I think if he had been
given a little more latitude,

39:18.527 --> 39:21.927
he may have been able to convince
me a little more about what

39:21.928 --> 39:23.607
he was talking about. OK.

39:23.608 --> 39:26.487
But he didn't come up with
anything that really made

39:26.488 --> 39:30.407
a plausible other explanation
for what happened.

39:30.408 --> 39:32.848
It still didn't make
a very good case for it being

39:32.849 --> 39:35.768
just a fall down the stairs.
So I was left kind of wondering,

39:35.769 --> 39:39.889
"Well, if he doesn't think it was
a beating, what was it?"

39:39.890 --> 39:41.329
OK, thank you.

39:41.330 --> 39:43.369
I'm just very freaked out.

39:43.370 --> 39:46.369
One of the things we've got to think
about when we think of Dr Lee is,

39:46.370 --> 39:50.130
this is not California,
this is not New York City,

39:50.131 --> 39:54.290
this is "the South", and I think
part of what we're hearing here

39:54.291 --> 39:57.890
is a reaction
to ethnic differences.

39:57.891 --> 40:00.251
Partly, but I think...
It's difficult.

40:00.252 --> 40:06.691
The substantive part of it is that
it's very overwhelming evidence

40:06.692 --> 40:10.812
of the blood and the wounds
that we're going to see,

40:10.813 --> 40:13.932
but I think, for me, the most
important things were

40:13.933 --> 40:16.693
he's a hired witness,
he's not clear,

40:16.694 --> 40:20.053
he talks with an accent,
he's too general...

40:20.054 --> 40:22.813
He doesn't provide an
alternative explanation.

40:22.814 --> 40:25.734
He doesn't provide an
alternative what happened.

40:25.735 --> 40:28.694
So I'm not sure we're going
to be able to

40:28.695 --> 40:31.254
come up with a good explanation.

40:31.255 --> 40:34.374
I think even if we spent an hour
with Henry talking about

40:34.375 --> 40:36.375
the limits of the science and...
No, it's not, no.

40:36.376 --> 40:37.855
They look at all this blood and say,

40:37.856 --> 40:40.095
"In the right case, maybe,
but not in this case."

40:40.096 --> 40:43.255
Right. Here, you have to be able to
know something about what happened,

40:43.256 --> 40:44.976
there's just too much blood,

40:44.977 --> 40:47.176
too much movement to not have
some information.

40:47.177 --> 40:50.056
Because people have this image that
we're saying she fell

40:50.057 --> 40:52.856
from the very top, so why aren't her
bones broken? Right.

40:52.857 --> 40:55.817
And if she fell that far,
how could she possibly get up again?

40:55.818 --> 40:58.457
Somehow we have to paint the
scenario that this happened

40:58.458 --> 41:01.977
three or four stairs up,
she fell back and hit her head,

41:01.978 --> 41:04.298
started bleeding,
slipped and fell again.

41:04.299 --> 41:07.618
I think Henry is not really
comfortable doing

41:07.619 --> 41:09.458
a lot more than poking holes.

41:09.459 --> 41:11.138
So we need to think about that.

41:11.139 --> 41:14.379
Cos that's clearly, at least in this
context, the big question for them.

41:14.380 --> 41:16.339
The state has a theory,
the defence doesn't,

41:16.340 --> 41:18.419
all the defence has is critiques.

41:18.420 --> 41:23.260
I've got a theory that if she's,
for example, if she's on the floor

41:23.261 --> 41:29.700
leaning against the chairlift, and
she goes up and her feet slip out...

41:29.701 --> 41:32.381
She never actually stood up at all,
she just got her feet...

41:32.382 --> 41:33.701
Right, right.

41:33.702 --> 41:35.981
Feet under, slip back again.

41:35.982 --> 41:41.582
She's got a 0.7 alcohol, she's got
Valium, there's blood

41:41.583 --> 41:45.023
on the floor, you've got this thing,
so every time she falls...

41:46.703 --> 41:50.143
..she's hitting her head from about
the same distance,

41:50.144 --> 41:52.023
right on that metal thing.

41:52.024 --> 41:54.024
WATER TRICKLES

42:01.705 --> 42:04.984
So what's the overall, bad news,
good news, what?

42:04.985 --> 42:08.985
Well, the overall bad news is,
again... We don't have any...

42:08.986 --> 42:11.745
We got no explanation to tell
them what happened.

42:11.746 --> 42:14.425
David and I talked about doing an
animation to reconstruct

42:14.426 --> 42:17.426
exactly how these injuries might
be inflicted by a fall...

42:17.427 --> 42:18.467
Right, right.

42:20.147 --> 42:21.186
BARKING

42:21.187 --> 42:26.507
That the dog? Yeah. I haven't heard
it, and I don't want to hear it.

42:26.508 --> 42:30.468
Come on, guys, come on.
Where's Wilbur? Hey, Wilbur!

42:31.748 --> 42:34.228
What'd you do with him, huh?

42:34.229 --> 42:35.868
The other bad thing
I didn't mention,

42:35.869 --> 42:39.388
of course the autopsy photos are
so visceral... Oh, Jesus, yeah!

42:39.389 --> 42:42.028
..people just react to them
immediately. Yeah.

42:42.029 --> 42:44.829
Are they that gruesome? I've not
looked at them, are they that awful?

42:44.830 --> 42:47.789
Yeah, they're pretty bad. You look
at them initially,

42:47.790 --> 42:49.629
you think, "Man..."
Your initial reaction

42:49.630 --> 42:51.309
from looking
at the autopsy photos is,

42:51.310 --> 42:53.190
"You can't get that from a fall."

42:53.191 --> 42:57.790
Mm. Which is one of our problems,
because we can't precisely

42:57.791 --> 43:01.110
explain how you do and can get
them from a fall.

43:01.111 --> 43:02.471
Right. All we can say is they

43:02.472 --> 43:05.151
definitely didn't come
from a beating either, right?

43:05.152 --> 43:07.391
Definitely did not come
from a beating,

43:07.392 --> 43:09.111
and we're very strong on that.

43:09.112 --> 43:11.272
They got the burden of proof, so...

43:11.273 --> 43:14.152
Yeah, but that burden of proof is
sort of like... No...

43:14.153 --> 43:15.992
It's like innocent
until proven guilty,

43:15.993 --> 43:18.352
which we all know is horseshit.

43:18.353 --> 43:21.073
You're guilty the
minute that they...

43:21.074 --> 43:23.633
Don't be such a cynic,
people get off on that all the time,

43:23.634 --> 43:25.713
you just don't read about it.
MICHAEL LAUGHS

43:25.714 --> 43:28.873
No, I AM a cynic on that.

43:28.874 --> 43:34.074
Innocent until proven guilty I think
is, the overwhelming thing is,

43:34.075 --> 43:37.034
hey, if the police arrest
you, you're guilty.

43:37.035 --> 43:38.995
This is what people believe.

43:38.996 --> 43:43.355
Well, that's why our main theory of
the case is, and the blow-up,

43:43.356 --> 43:49.196
how did this case get transformed
from accident -

43:49.197 --> 43:54.156
as reported by them initially -
to murder?

43:54.157 --> 43:58.677
And David is thinking about taking
the original report

43:58.678 --> 44:00.917
from Dr Snell, medical examiner,

44:00.918 --> 44:03.437
where he concluded that
in his opinion...

44:03.438 --> 44:06.398
That it was a fall, right?
He actually offered an explanation.

44:06.399 --> 44:09.318
That she fell on the third step and
hit her head somewhere else.

44:09.319 --> 44:11.158
Oh, really? It's fairly detailed.

44:11.159 --> 44:14.158
The medical examiner says it's
an accident, he was here, right?

44:14.159 --> 44:15.439
Exactly.

44:15.440 --> 44:19.799
The single thing that Holland had to
go on, right? Nothing.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.840
And yet within...

44:23.600 --> 44:27.960
..hell, 30 minutes of that son of
a bitch coming in here,

44:27.961 --> 44:32.001
it was a crime scene and I was
guilty - and that was it.
