00:11.970 --> 00:13.335
Dr. Carson:
Welcome back.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.589
Do you remember me?

00:17.767 --> 00:19.098
I'm Dr. Carson.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.475
You're at Hilltop Colony.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.351
You've been asleep
for a while.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.558
You suffered from the condition
abruptio placentae.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.941
It's a separation
of the placenta from uterus.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.271
It's unusual this early,

00:29.446 --> 00:32.438
but, uh,
could be caused by trauma.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.992
- Possibly the bruises on your abdomen--
- Did I-I...

00:35.160 --> 00:37.025
(exhales sharply)

00:37.203 --> 00:38.943
"Jose?

00:40.707 --> 00:42.698
No.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.868
Separation was small.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.162
Baby's heart rate is normal.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.079
Here, listen.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.005
(button clicks)

00:55.180 --> 00:57.262
- (heart beating)
- There it is.

00:57.432 --> 01:00.219
(breathes deeply)

01:02.437 --> 01:06.021
Now, you need to take it easy
for a few days.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.103
You don't want to exacerbate
the separation any more.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.562
And I really think
you need to stay here

01:10.737 --> 01:12.398
for the duration
of your pregnancy.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.813
If anything else happens,
I can take care of it.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.192
You have any questions?

01:19.370 --> 01:20.780
Whoa, whoa.
Easy.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.446
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.115
(breathes shallowly)

01:25.293 --> 01:28.581
Can you say that again?

01:28.755 --> 01:32.714
What?

01:32.884 --> 01:35.216
Everything you just said.

01:35.386 --> 01:38.970
(indistinct conversations)

01:46.815 --> 01:48.146
You, uh-- you okay?

01:55.448 --> 01:56.904
Where is he?

01:58.827 --> 02:00.783
(exhales sharply)
Where are they both?

02:34.320 --> 02:36.356
Sasha:
It was in Glenn's pocket.

02:39.367 --> 02:42.029
All Abraham had
was a cigar.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.488
(chuckles)

03:03.808 --> 03:08.097
(breathes deeply)

03:11.774 --> 03:13.514
(sniffles)

03:18.781 --> 03:22.023
It feels like
everything is wrong.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.985
Not everything.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.377
He told me
that you're gonna be all right.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.418
He said you'll just
have to take it easy

03:38.593 --> 03:40.299
for the next few days.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.836
He told me
that we have to stay.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.725
That we, um--

03:48.895 --> 03:50.055
he says it's better
if he's close,

03:50.230 --> 03:53.643
just in case,
till the baby's born.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.068
Then we'll stay.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.646
I'm still thinking about it.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.687
You're staying.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.446
And so am |.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.945
Jesus:
It's nice to see you up.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.613
Flowers.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.952
It was you.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.957
Ones on your bed, too.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.622
| read somewhere
that blue flowers

04:19.801 --> 04:23.714
inspire strength
and calming.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.345
What's green?

04:26.516 --> 04:27.881
Release.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.472
(sniffles)

04:31.646 --> 04:34.308
Thank God
you're finally awake.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.848
You people said
you got them all.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.403
We thought we did.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.777
It was just an outpost.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.904
H-how many of them
were there?

04:44.075 --> 04:45.190
There were a lot.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.074
Maybe hundreds.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.486
Do they know the deal
you made us take, Marsha?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.905
- It's Maggie.
- No.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.450
And we didn't make you
take the deal, Gregory.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.495
l-l-l'm happy
we could patch you up.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.459
You need to go.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.248
Make sure you let Rich know
what we did for you.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.419
Dr. Carson
said I should stay.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.336
If he thinks he has the authority
to make that decision,

05:07.515 --> 05:08.971
he's mistaken.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.351
Don't look at me
like that.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.682
She'll be safer
with her own people.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.893
And we'll be safer
without her.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.603
You need to keep your distance
from Maggie

05:19.777 --> 05:22.564
and stay focused on your work
here at Hilltop.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.650
Did you do this?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.610
We don't bury our dead.
We burn them.

05:26.784 --> 05:29.400
Sasha: I did it.
I don't live here.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.695
Gregory, this is Sasha.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.080
She got Maggie here.
They're both from Alexandria.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.038
I can't--

05:38.212 --> 05:40.373
l-l don't have time to keep
track of everybody.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.004
I've been recuperating, too,
Jesus,

05:42.175 --> 05:43.961
from a stab wound.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.671
You know?

05:45.845 --> 05:49.838
Maggie said that her people
could take care of the Saviors.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.598
S-so far, all they've done
is put our community at risk.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.385
You know, if they see you here,
they'll think we colluded.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.723
We did.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.685
I did not agree to this.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.396
If they think
we helped attack their outpost,

06:02.570 --> 06:04.561
they'll do that to us.

06:04.739 --> 06:05.945
Jesus,
do you have any idea

06:06.115 --> 06:08.106
what plausible deniability
means?

06:08.284 --> 06:09.945
- Yes.
- Well, then you know

06:10.119 --> 06:12.030
it's our way out.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.321
If they leave,
we have plausible deniability.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.579
Gregory,
it-- it'll be night soon.

06:15.750 --> 06:16.910
It's not safe for them
to leave now.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.950
(scoffs)

06:19.128 --> 06:21.380
Look, I'm a good guy.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.708
You can stay the night.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.623
But leave in the morning.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.542
We'll talk more about it
tonight.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.880
No,
I made my decision.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.261
I'm just saying
that maybe--

06:30.431 --> 06:31.716
Do you want to go back
with them?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.050
I'll take them back.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.891
- I meant--
- I know what you meant.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.975
So it's settled.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.939
No, it's not.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.150
Maggie is pregnant.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.361
Well...
that's her mistake.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.651
Wait.

07:10.346 --> 07:13.258
(music playing)

07:51.304 --> 07:53.465
Rick:
You should come with us.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.345
Carl: Someone's
got to be here for Judith.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.347
There's people
who want to help.

07:57.518 --> 08:00.806
We'll only be gone
a few days at the most.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.345
We need supplies.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.603
They're gonna be
coming back soon.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.900
Is this
how it's gonna be now?

08:05.067 --> 08:06.853
- Yes.
- (sighs)

08:07.028 --> 08:08.063
It is.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.647
You know that.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.782
See you in a few days.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.953
We should get going.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.533
He'll come around.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.662
l'll, uh,
meet you downstairs.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.467
You change your mind...

08:33.638 --> 08:35.174
we're headed north.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.928
Good luck.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.888
Yeah.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.394
I'll see you soon.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.458
Thank you.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.877
Why didn't you go
with my dad?

09:15.012 --> 09:16.968
Michonne:
l have to figure some things out.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.100
What is there
to figure out?

09:20.268 --> 09:23.055
How we can do this.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.594
If we can.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.978
We can't.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.309
No, not like this.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.270
Your dad
thinks differently.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.650
And he's wrong.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.936
You know it.

09:39.161 --> 09:41.948
Even if I think he is...

09:44.500 --> 09:45.865
I don't know.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.464
Change your bandage later,
and be nice to Olivia.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.681
(rattles)

10:16.115 --> 10:17.150
Carl: Enid.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.325
(panting)

10:21.495 --> 10:22.826
I need to see Maggie.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.158
You're walking
to the Hilltop?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.869
It's far.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.499
I'll be fine.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.169
Maybe.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.331
I'll be fine.

10:34.508 --> 10:35.964
l have better aim
than you.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.508
(exhales deeply)

10:43.517 --> 10:44.768
ldidn't mean it that way.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.393
I'm not saving you anymore.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.725
(sighs)

10:50.900 --> 10:52.731
That's what happened
in the armory?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.017
You saved me?

10:54.195 --> 10:55.275
Yeah.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.860
You made it back
in one piece.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.149
You're still here.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.488
I'm not talking about that.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.289
I'm sorry
you had to see it.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.454
I'm not.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.223
You sure
I can't talk you into

11:33.401 --> 11:35.517
taking the extra room
at Barrington House?

11:43.244 --> 11:47.738
For what it's worth,
I'm glad you're here.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.906
Then make Gregory
change his mind.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.199
I'm going to try.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.958
It's not good enough.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.539
(sighs)

11:54.714 --> 11:56.329
It's not.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.213
But the people
need me here.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.840
If it was just Gregory,
it'd be worse.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.170
So why aren't you
in charge?

12:01.345 --> 12:02.960
It's not me.
I'm not a leader.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.518
What if I leave?

12:11.689 --> 12:13.350
If Maggie can stay,

12:13.524 --> 12:15.230
l'll scavenge,
for the Hilltop.

12:15.401 --> 12:19.110
I'll pay her way
if you just keep her safe.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.362
Would Gregory
go for that?

12:21.532 --> 12:23.397
Maybe.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.158
But l-l don't want that.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.114
What do you want, Jesus?

12:28.289 --> 12:30.325
What do you want
this place to be?

12:35.713 --> 12:36.998
l-l just...

12:38.299 --> 12:41.166
| just try to help.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.720
Maybe you got to do more.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.317
I found it here.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.332
I'm sorry.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.743
I liked him.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.287
He was one of the only people
I'd ever met

13:19.465 --> 13:20.955
who could say things
that make you smile and wince

13:21.133 --> 13:22.213
at the same time.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.419
(chuckles)

13:23.594 --> 13:24.879
(knock on door)

13:25.054 --> 13:26.214
Come in.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.806
I made the bed for you
and laid out some clothes.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.011
They're mine,

13:32.186 --> 13:34.222
so they're more utility
than comfort.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.385
Maggie: It's okay.

13:35.564 --> 13:36.895
We won't be here
much longer.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.057
Jesus:
I'm sorry, about all of it.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.476
I'm gonna see
what I can do.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.280
Mm.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.490
Why do you
burn your dead?

13:51.664 --> 13:52.870
Um...

13:53.040 --> 13:56.703
the idea was
just to keep going.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.788
What do you have
to remember 'em by?

14:00.589 --> 14:01.669
Us.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.300
I'll see you
in the morning.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.422
(door opens, closes)

14:21.986 --> 14:24.352
- Now what?
- (Sasha chuckles)

14:24.530 --> 14:26.987
Maybe we stay.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.318
What can Gregory do?

14:29.493 --> 14:31.233
He's in charge.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.868
He's an idiot.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.448
He's a coward.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.035
They're more dangerous.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.949
We have the night.
Let's think on it.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.540
Things will be clearer
in the mornin'.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.878
(bicycle squeaks)

15:08.866 --> 15:10.777
(walker growling)

15:15.456 --> 15:18.243
(engine revs)

15:18.417 --> 15:20.157
(tires screech)

15:36.101 --> 15:38.638
(engine revs, tires squeal)

15:53.369 --> 15:55.735
What are you doing here?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.904
Felt like a drive.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.368
(feedback squeals)

16:04.546 --> 16:07.208
(Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9,
2nd Movement" playing on radio)

16:07.383 --> 16:08.623
What is that?

16:10.052 --> 16:11.258
The gates are open.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.634
There's fires.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.638
The music
is coming from a car.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.514
("Symphony No. 9, 2nd
Movement" continues)

16:24.274 --> 16:26.060
(grunts)

16:26.235 --> 16:27.975
l have to
turn that thing off.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.521
Dr. Carson told you
to stay off your feet.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.236
I can't let you do this
by yourself.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.820
Sit.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.910
Go.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.073
(music continues
playing on radio)

16:49.174 --> 16:52.211
(walkers growling)

16:54.096 --> 16:57.088
(music continues
playing on radio)

17:04.523 --> 17:06.104
("Symphony No. 9" continues)

17:06.275 --> 17:08.140
(walkers growling)

17:08.318 --> 17:09.398
(Sasha grunts)

17:09.570 --> 17:12.562
(music continues)

17:23.417 --> 17:25.032
Maggie: Jesus!

17:25.210 --> 17:28.373
Sasha's alone down there!
She needs help!

17:31.925 --> 17:33.381
Damn it, Maggie.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.638
Maggie: You two!

17:40.809 --> 17:42.140
Get those gates closed!

17:42.311 --> 17:43.926
On it!

17:44.104 --> 17:45.810
(walker growling)

18:06.752 --> 18:08.583
Oh, man, come on.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.010
("Symphony No. 9" continues)

18:25.104 --> 18:26.310
- Hi.
- Sorry.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.515
It's okay.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.440
We need to close
the gates.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.599
Yeah.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.236
(engine revving)

18:43.122 --> 18:44.407
Sasha.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.912
She's got it.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.289
I need your help here.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.668
(walkers growling)

19:13.485 --> 19:14.895
(metal crunching)

19:36.216 --> 19:38.798
(music stops)

19:40.554 --> 19:44.513
Not sorry you saw it?

19:44.683 --> 19:46.423
Yeah.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.218
I watched it.

19:49.396 --> 19:50.385
Both times.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.976
I didn't look away.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.481
Why?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.903
Because
when it was happening,

20:00.073 --> 20:04.316
I knew that I needed
to remember it.

20:04.494 --> 20:07.076
So when I had
the chance to kill him,

20:07.247 --> 20:09.533
I wouldn't have a choice.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.494
I think I'd kill him, too.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.456
It's messed up, but...

20:18.634 --> 20:20.841
that's how it is.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.593
You do things
for the ones you love.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.513
Loved.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.220
It's not for them.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.475
I'm sorry I locked you
in the armory.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.140
I didn't need to see it.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.856
We don't even know
if she's okay.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.990
We'll get there.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.276
Yeah.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.206
Gregory: I don't care what they did.
The answer is no.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.743
I'm not turning away
a pregnant woman who helped us.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.627
I'm not turning away Sasha,
either.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.130
- Who the hell is Sasha?
- They're staying.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.337
You're not in charge, Jesus.
I am.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.377
I'm the one who has to look
after the safety of this place.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.511
What, are you telling me
you want to call the plays,

21:07.683 --> 21:09.093
after all this time,

21:09.268 --> 21:10.474
after I set the table here?

21:13.438 --> 21:15.178
Say the word.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.520
The broken gate, the Saviors,
the people--

21:18.694 --> 21:20.935
all of this can be yours.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.024
Only you'd have to stick around
for more than five minutes.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.359
You'd actually have to be
a part of this place.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.695
Sasha: Gregory?

21:29.371 --> 21:32.033
Ah, H was just telling
Ms. Caitlin

21:32.207 --> 21:34.038
to bring up some of
her famous rhubarb preserves

21:34.209 --> 21:35.324
for you both.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.708
It's our way of saying
thank you

21:36.878 --> 21:37.867
for helping out last night.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.582
It's Ms. Maitlin.

21:39.756 --> 21:42.008
You can take them with you
when you go.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.881
And you should go now,

21:44.052 --> 21:46.304
because the Saviors
could get back any minute.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.006
- I'll go.
- Maggie: Sasha...

21:51.184 --> 21:52.640
But let her stay.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.227
We'll call it even
on last night.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.387
No deal.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.352
But it's been lovely
having you here.

22:01.611 --> 22:04.353
Just tell me
how we can make this work.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.358
I think we'd need to...

22:09.536 --> 22:12.152
meet on that one-on-one
just to explore--

22:12.331 --> 22:13.946
Go to hell.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.082
Are you actually imply--

22:18.253 --> 22:20.710
No. You know what?
I'm sorry.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.122
I'm gonna tell Ms. Caitlin
to keep her preserves.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.542
(truck approaching,
indistinct shouting)

22:31.224 --> 22:32.680
You know what they'll do
if they find you here?

22:32.851 --> 22:33.886
Jesus,
get them in the closet.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.426
- Gregory--
- Go get in there now.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.935
And you don't move,
you don't speak,

22:37.105 --> 22:38.686
and maybe you'll
get out of this alive.

23:13.308 --> 23:14.969
Enid.

23:15.143 --> 23:16.178
Stop.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.084
Hello.

24:24.254 --> 24:25.585
Simon: Hello.

24:25.755 --> 24:26.790
You're Gregory.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.001
Guilty as charged.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.167
Uh, welcome
to Hilltop Colony.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.300
Thank you.

24:33.472 --> 24:37.056
Do, uh...
make yourself at home.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.385
Eh.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.596
This isn't a social call.

24:40.770 --> 24:41.850
Oh.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.764
l-l-l--
I wouldn't think it is.

24:44.941 --> 24:47.853
We need to talk.

24:48.028 --> 24:51.987
And it's getting a little
claustrophobic in here, right?

24:54.659 --> 24:56.570
Let's talk in your study.

24:56.745 --> 24:59.407
I wanna see that painting.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.570
Can't remember
who told me about it,

25:00.749 --> 25:04.492
but I'm pretty sure
it doesn't matter much anymore.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.625
Don't know if you heard
what happened.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.172
W-what happened?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.752
Well, those people
you used to deal with.

25:10.926 --> 25:14.669
Our brothers and sisters
in arms and operation,

25:14.846 --> 25:17.883
well, they've been removed
from the field of play.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.093
Uh, brothers and sisters?

25:19.267 --> 25:20.882
What--
w-what do you mean?

25:21.061 --> 25:22.642
(chuckles)

25:22.812 --> 25:25.975
I think you know
what it means.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.730
It means we need to talk!

25:40.205 --> 25:41.285
Wow.

25:41.456 --> 25:42.491
(chuckles)

25:42.666 --> 25:47.035
Just... wow.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.794
ln-- in regarding last night,

25:49.965 --> 25:51.956
m-m-message received.

25:52.133 --> 25:54.340
Loud and clear.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.923
What was the message?

25:59.516 --> 26:01.347
You said
it was loud and clear.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.054
(stammers)
Just l--

26:03.228 --> 26:06.311
I think you were showing us
who was boss, right?

26:06.481 --> 26:08.392
Oh.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.183
(chuckles)

26:11.361 --> 26:12.817
Yeah. Shit.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.694
It's just--

26:14.864 --> 26:17.606
it's just breathtaking.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.399
Yeah.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.991
See, that's management
by example.

26:23.164 --> 26:25.450
Ah.
(chuckles)

26:25.625 --> 26:27.456
Crap you got to deal with,
right?

26:27.627 --> 26:29.163
(chuckles)
Oh, you're telling me.

26:29.337 --> 26:31.077
(chuckles)

26:31.256 --> 26:32.962
So, last night,

26:33.133 --> 26:37.217
that was us
working our asses off

26:37.387 --> 26:41.255
to provide you
an example.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.593
Hmm?

26:43.977 --> 26:47.390
You got a nice place.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.226
Tall walls.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.392
People in here
probably forget

26:53.570 --> 26:55.276
what the corpses
look like...

26:55.447 --> 26:56.687
Ah.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.150
...what they smell like.

27:02.495 --> 27:05.237
Now, we were gonna
kill them for you,

27:05.415 --> 27:09.158
to remind you of the service
we can provide,

27:09.336 --> 27:12.123
and you cleaned up the mess
yourselves.

27:12.297 --> 27:16.631
Good on you.

27:16.801 --> 27:21.215
Well, we must have picked up
some skills from your people.

27:21.389 --> 27:25.007
Uh, if you think about it...

27:25.185 --> 27:27.267
you still saved us,
right?

27:27.437 --> 27:28.973
Well, that's a nice way
to look at it.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.182
I appreciate that.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.517
Well, I'm a team player,
you know?

27:31.691 --> 27:34.228
l-l-l-l think that's why
the people chose me.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.563
Well, the other people of ours
you were dealing with?

27:36.738 --> 27:37.818
Yeah?

27:39.991 --> 27:43.028
Ithink they...

27:43.203 --> 27:45.660
got spoiled
working with a guy like you.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.536
(chuckles)
Yeah, well...

27:47.707 --> 27:48.867
Yeah.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.748
I think they might've
got a little soft.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.659
Yeah. (chuckles)

27:52.837 --> 27:54.873
It's what got them butchered,
I imagine.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.164
They're dead?

28:00.303 --> 28:01.418
Very, very dead.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.507
Extremely dead.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.437
But, you know,
it all worked out.

28:13.608 --> 28:16.520
(chuckles)

28:16.695 --> 28:19.232
Because the people
that killed them,

28:19.406 --> 28:22.068
they work for us now.

28:22.242 --> 28:26.451
And they are

28:26.621 --> 28:29.328
real go-getters,
you know?

28:29.499 --> 28:30.659
(breathes deeply)

28:30.834 --> 28:32.790
It's, um, a shame

28:32.961 --> 28:35.543
when things like that
have to happen, you know?

28:37.632 --> 28:40.874
Please tell Negan

28:41.052 --> 28:45.466
I understand the benefits
in, uh, crossing the aisle.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.469
No.

28:48.643 --> 28:50.679
No reason for that.

28:50.854 --> 28:51.889
No?

28:52.063 --> 28:54.930
Because, for now,

28:55.108 --> 28:57.565
I'm your Negan.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.192
'Cause that's what
Negan wants.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.898
But thank you.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.067
It means a lot
that you recognize

29:07.245 --> 29:08.860
what we bring
to the table.

29:11.082 --> 29:14.495
That's why
you're still here, and...

29:14.669 --> 29:16.284
others aren't.

29:16.463 --> 29:19.045
- (chuckles)
- (chuckles nervously)

29:19.215 --> 29:20.921
Understand?

29:21.092 --> 29:22.593
Oh, I understand.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.837
Good.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.339
Yeah.

29:29.517 --> 29:32.054
It is.
It's good. It's good.

29:32.228 --> 29:35.095
Anything else
you want me to know?

29:35.273 --> 29:37.184
No.

29:37.358 --> 29:40.270
Any hitches in the giddyap
I should be aware of?

29:42.739 --> 29:43.945
Hmm?

29:47.952 --> 29:49.362
Gregory?

29:56.044 --> 30:00.788
(breathing heavily)

30:03.384 --> 30:05.215
Actually, there is.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.080
Are you serious?

30:44.092 --> 30:47.380
- This is, uh--
- Scotch.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.260
Well, not just--

30:49.430 --> 30:50.681
Hate the stuff.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.467
Tastes like, um,
ashtrays and window cleaner.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.259
I'm a gin man.

30:56.437 --> 31:00.055
But this does look like
it could harden a connoisseur.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.473
Wow.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.857
What a gesture.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.358
You say you hate it?

31:04.529 --> 31:05.985
Negan'll love this.

31:06.155 --> 31:10.524
Now, I'm gonna say it's from me,
not mention you, okay?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.158
I really want
the headline on this one.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.579
- Okay?
- But, uh--

31:16.708 --> 31:18.198
Ahh.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.541
You want to slide that one
backin?

31:25.800 --> 31:27.040
Sorry. I shouldn't ask.

31:27.218 --> 31:31.382
You want to slide that one
back in, period.

31:40.857 --> 31:43.314
This is big, Gregory.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.769
It's huge.

31:44.944 --> 31:46.104
And I won't forget it.

31:46.279 --> 31:49.646
I really, really
appreciate this.

31:49.824 --> 31:50.904
Thank you.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.117
Now, we're gonna
go through the place

31:55.288 --> 31:57.199
and take half
of everything you have.

31:57.373 --> 32:00.160
But only half.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.620
(clicks tongue)

32:02.837 --> 32:06.955
Take this to the Negan truck,
okay?

32:07.133 --> 32:10.045
Exeunt, gentlemen!
Get to work.

32:10.219 --> 32:12.596
Oh, and take the painting.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.220
One last thing, Gregory.

32:23.566 --> 32:26.524
Could ljust get a kneel
out of you?

32:26.694 --> 32:27.945
Excuse me?

32:30.365 --> 32:31.605
Kneel.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.758
(inhales deeply)

32:53.221 --> 32:56.054
That's a solid kneel,
Gregory.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.678
You remember that
for next time.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.898
(door opens, closes)

33:25.670 --> 33:27.581
Carl:
I don't think Negan's here.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.711
I don't see
that black truck.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.885
You weren't
taking a drive.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.848
You weren't
coming to get me.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.072
I can't let them
get away with this.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.483
- You know I can't.
- I know.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.822
Come with me.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.908
You want to kill them, too.
We can do it.

34:03.082 --> 34:04.868
Uh-- (sighs)

34:06.919 --> 34:08.375
You said it.

34:10.423 --> 34:12.288
It would be for us.

34:12.467 --> 34:15.755
Not for Abraham,
not for Glenn.

34:15.928 --> 34:19.637
Not for Maggie.

34:19.807 --> 34:21.422
You're doing it for you.

34:25.104 --> 34:26.389
Yeah.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.058
So if it all goes right...

34:36.157 --> 34:38.569
and you do it...

34:40.036 --> 34:42.493
- how do you get away?
- It wouldn't matter.

34:42.663 --> 34:43.994
It would to me.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.393
Please don't go.

35:07.563 --> 35:08.552
Just come with me.

35:08.731 --> 35:10.312
- You can't make it--
- I'm just gonna go home.

35:12.276 --> 35:15.359
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

35:20.701 --> 35:21.986
(chuckles)

35:23.871 --> 35:25.156
You shouldn't go.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.206
But I can't stop you.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.538
They'll see you.

35:35.716 --> 35:38.332
No. They won't.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.721
I told you to hide them
in the hallway closet!

35:44.892 --> 35:46.428
No, you said "closet."

35:46.602 --> 35:47.887
This is my bedroom.

35:48.062 --> 35:49.302
What if they came in here
before l--

35:49.480 --> 35:50.560
Before you tried
to give us up?

35:50.731 --> 35:52.016
They would've
killed you first.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.432
- Honey, I'm talking to Jesus.
- Stop.

35:54.610 --> 35:56.146
Why are you even
defending her?

35:56.320 --> 35:58.527
We're here right now
because she and-- and Rich

35:58.698 --> 36:00.313
didn't handle things
like they said they would.

36:00.491 --> 36:01.901
The Saviors
tried to kill you.

36:02.076 --> 36:03.486
That was
a misunderstanding.

36:03.661 --> 36:04.776
And as soon as
the Saviors leave,

36:04.954 --> 36:06.364
we get them
the hell out of here

36:06.539 --> 36:07.654
before something bad
really happens.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.242
Stop!

36:09.417 --> 36:11.123
They're staying.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.955
Or do you want
to make it public?

36:13.129 --> 36:15.415
You want to make the deal
with Alexandria public?

36:15.590 --> 36:17.626
Lose your
plausible deniability?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.540
Lose your position?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.258
So you're gonna be
in charge now?

36:24.432 --> 36:26.093
No.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.848
It's just
that you won't be.

36:29.312 --> 36:30.973
Maggie and Sasha are staying.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.012
I'm staying.

36:33.191 --> 36:37.184
We're all gonna be one big happy
dysfunctional family.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.363
(chuckles)

36:42.533 --> 36:45.024
So we will be.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.945
And I'll see us
through this.

36:48.122 --> 36:49.953
I made progress
with them today.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.615
- You saw it.
- That's not what I saw.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.579
Yeah?
Well, it's what happened.

36:56.797 --> 37:00.085
We play nice,
they play nice.

37:00.259 --> 37:02.375
See, dear? Saviors can actually
be quite reasonable.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.010
(groans)

37:16.234 --> 37:18.270
It's a fine watch.

37:18.444 --> 37:20.025
Doesn't need to be
left out in the rain.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.482
This is our home now.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.865
So you'll learn to start
to call me by my name.

37:26.035 --> 37:29.493
Not Marsha, not "dear,"
not "honey."

37:29.664 --> 37:31.950
Maggie.

37:32.124 --> 37:34.501
Maggie Rhee.

37:39.173 --> 37:42.006
Jesus: When I got here,
Gregory was already in charge.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.041
Thought the people
chose him for a reason.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.303
Looking at it now,
I think it just happened.

37:47.473 --> 37:50.385
I didn't like
how he did things.

37:50.559 --> 37:53.141
But I couldn't imagine
anyone else in his place.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.763
I can now.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.181
Who?

38:00.194 --> 38:01.934
We'll talk about it
sometime.

38:04.907 --> 38:07.523
lshould've talked
to Gregory sooner.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.818
I'm sorry.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.282
Hopefully, you'll let me
make it up to you.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.037
We will.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.619
The gates are closed.

38:19.797 --> 38:23.585
Wait, they're still
loading up outside.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.670
I'll see you
back at the trailer.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.927
(sighs)

38:37.231 --> 38:39.062
If you want
to make it up to us...

38:41.902 --> 38:44.393
can you find
where Negan lives?

38:48.909 --> 38:50.365
One of the trucks
is going back there,

38:50.536 --> 38:54.575
so, yeah, I can do that.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.958
Can you keep it between us,
just you and me?

39:03.132 --> 39:04.338
No Maggie?

39:06.302 --> 39:08.509
(sighs)
I don't like that.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.472
Me neither.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.446
You're here.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.786
Are you okay?

39:35.956 --> 39:37.366
I'm not.

39:53.974 --> 39:55.430
But I will be.

40:07.405 --> 40:12.616
People told me you killed
walkers and a car...

40:12.785 --> 40:14.116
with a tractor?

40:14.286 --> 40:16.663
I couldn't
sit by and watch.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.742
Not again.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.907
So I guess
I sat and did something.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.792
- You're supposed to take it easy.
- It wasn't hard.

40:25.714 --> 40:27.295
It wasn't the first time.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.631
There was this boy
in high school.

40:34.306 --> 40:35.682
You ran over the boy?

40:35.850 --> 40:37.340
His car.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.383
- Oh. (chuckles)
- It was a Camaro.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.927
And then it wasn't.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.720
- (laughs)
- (door opens)

40:44.733 --> 40:46.018
Enid.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.149
Hi.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.936
|-- I came to help.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.527
You came by yourself?

40:53.701 --> 40:54.907
Yeah.

40:55.077 --> 40:56.283
Have some dinner.

40:59.748 --> 41:02.990
Why are there balloons
on Abraham's grave?

41:04.462 --> 41:06.623
I didn't have the heart
to tell you.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.003
Glenn would've.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.710
He was a bad liar.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.504
Sorry.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.509
There's no need
to be sorry.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.762
Nothing wrong
with balloons.

41:16.932 --> 41:19.674
There's nothing
marking the graves.

41:19.852 --> 41:22.844
Nope.

41:23.022 --> 41:26.640
l was gonna use this
for Glenn's.

41:26.817 --> 41:27.806
It was my dad's.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.270
He gave it to him.

41:31.697 --> 41:32.857
But I'm giving it to you.

41:37.411 --> 41:39.322
We don't need anything
to remember 'em by.

41:42.708 --> 41:44.323
We have us.

41:58.891 --> 42:01.849
For this new morning,
with its light,

42:02.019 --> 42:05.932
for rest and shelter
of the night,

42:06.106 --> 42:10.475
for health and food,

42:10.653 --> 42:13.269
for love and friends,

42:13.447 --> 42:17.406
for everything
Thy goodness sends.

42:17.576 --> 42:19.362
Amen.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.777
Amen.
Amen.

42:23.999 --> 42:26.991
(scratching)

43:00.536 --> 43:02.322
(grunts)

43:11.672 --> 43:12.787
Carl: Hey.

43:26.687 --> 43:30.100
