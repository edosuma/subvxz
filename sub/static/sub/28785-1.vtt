WEBVTT

00:10.770 --> 00:13.030
So you truly
do believe that you,

00:13.070 --> 00:14.640
Jack Parsons, can build a ship

00:14.680 --> 00:16.420
that will take us all
to the moon?

00:16.470 --> 00:17.770
- Yes.
- Preposterous.

00:17.820 --> 00:21.040
What is standing in the way

00:21.080 --> 00:22.730
of manifesting your dream?

00:22.780 --> 00:24.690
Plenty.
My partner, for starters.

00:24.740 --> 00:27.170
This is Caltech, Mr. Parsons.

00:27.220 --> 00:28.870
We don't deal in fantasy.

00:28.910 --> 00:30.920
We deal in hard facts.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.700
And what about your wife?

00:32.740 --> 00:34.750
But Jack refuses to
listen to reason.

00:34.790 --> 00:37.490
Then it's difficult to know
what we're up against.

00:37.530 --> 00:40.360
You have always
seemed to me to be...

00:40.400 --> 00:42.280
like water.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.100
I believe
you have found far more

00:44.150 --> 00:46.370
in Mr. Parsons than an acolyte.

00:46.410 --> 00:48.980
I believe you've found...

00:49.020 --> 00:51.630
your liberation.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.110
Going to the moon

00:53.160 --> 00:54.526
is not just
a scientific inevitability.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.460
It's a strategic necessity.

00:56.510 --> 00:57.900
They didn't want rockets.

00:57.940 --> 00:59.226
They wanted a way
for planes to take off

00:59.250 --> 01:00.510
from shorter runways.

01:00.550 --> 01:01.900
I don't give a damn

01:01.950 --> 01:03.536
what they wanted.
I am the one who made it real.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.950
Not you. Me.

01:04.989 --> 01:06.470
You didn't make it real.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.080
You made it small.

01:08.130 --> 01:10.040
You haven't...? Haven't what?

01:10.090 --> 01:11.610
You know.Maybe.

01:11.650 --> 01:13.090
You and Jack must do it
all the time.

01:13.130 --> 01:16.140
Isn't that the whole point
of getting married?

01:16.180 --> 01:18.700
I think something
might be wrong with me.

01:18.750 --> 01:22.450
But until you confront
the source of your shame,

01:22.490 --> 01:24.710
you will remain
a prisoner of it.

01:24.750 --> 01:27.670
- Susan!
- Tell them.

01:27.710 --> 01:31.240
I don't know
what she's talking about.

01:31.280 --> 01:33.670
I'm going to teach you
about shame. This is my house,

01:33.720 --> 01:35.346
and I am not gonna stand here...
Why didn't you ever say anything?

01:35.370 --> 01:37.160
And what about you, Father?

01:37.200 --> 01:38.590
Did he confess his sins?

01:38.640 --> 01:39.656
And did you give
him some prayers

01:39.680 --> 01:41.200
as penance,
as if that could ever

01:41.250 --> 01:42.340
wash him clean?!

01:43.950 --> 01:46.770
How could you do that to her,
your own flesh and blood?

01:47.990 --> 01:49.690
Shut your vile mouth!

01:49.730 --> 01:50.976
We have
a demonstration tomorrow.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.780
For the military.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.716
This is taking it too far.
We can't let him fly that plane.

01:56.740 --> 01:59.440
- Ernest is a grown man, okay?
- He's doing this

01:59.480 --> 02:02.310
of his own free will.
Marisol, did Jack send you?

02:02.360 --> 02:04.710
Or that-that group? No, Richie, I swear.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.880
I'm not even part of
the Agape anymore.

02:06.930 --> 02:09.449
I got exactly what
I was looking for.

02:09.490 --> 02:11.450
You know what drew me
to the Agape?

02:11.500 --> 02:14.280
It was this magical place where
people let their guards down,

02:14.320 --> 02:16.150
trusted one another.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.850
God help us if anyone

02:17.890 --> 02:20.200
ever got in,
tried to take advantage.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.460
They'd be like a wolf
in a henhouse.

02:24.990 --> 02:28.470
- Do you do this of your own free will?
- I do.

02:28.510 --> 02:30.860
Then let the rituals
be performed with beauty.

02:30.910 --> 02:32.730
Count down...

02:32.780 --> 02:35.210
from the number 93.

02:35.260 --> 02:37.560
Ten.

02:37.610 --> 02:38.960
Nine.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.570
Eight.

02:40.610 --> 02:41.570
Seven.

02:41.610 --> 02:42.570
Six.

02:42.610 --> 02:43.920
Five.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.220
Four.

02:45.270 --> 02:46.880
Three.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.140
Two.

02:48.180 --> 02:49.750
One!

02:49.790 --> 02:50.790
One!

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:31.360 --> 03:32.360
Can you get the lights?

03:35.010 --> 03:38.710
From a single spark
may burst forth a flame.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.280
Though we may be here
to celebrate,

03:40.320 --> 03:42.800
we must not lose sight
of the great struggle

03:42.850 --> 03:44.940
that consumes us all.

03:44.980 --> 03:47.810
Not just between
the Allies and Axis powers,

03:47.850 --> 03:50.030
but between light and dark...

03:50.070 --> 03:52.510
and between good and evil.

03:52.550 --> 03:54.290
After all,
we must defend freedom

03:54.340 --> 03:56.300
unless we all wish to be slaves.

03:56.340 --> 03:58.340
I think what my colleague
is trying to say is

03:58.380 --> 04:00.260
we can feel good
about the work we're doing.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.650
Every plane our JATOs
get off the ground

04:02.690 --> 04:05.440
is helping the good guys
beat the Germans and Japs

04:05.480 --> 04:06.910
that much quicker.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.000
Bomb them all to hell!

04:25.190 --> 04:26.980
Mr. Parsons.

04:27.020 --> 04:30.330
I'd heard Samson Hunt enlisted
and there might be a...

04:30.370 --> 04:32.110
It's already filled.
Sorry, Professor.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.030
We've got engineers coming
out of our ears right now.

04:35.070 --> 04:38.900
But you will be the first person
I call if anything comes up.

04:38.950 --> 04:40.170
Thank you.

04:40.210 --> 04:41.910
Enjoy.

04:41.950 --> 04:44.690
I've got half a mind
to hire the poor sap.

04:44.740 --> 04:46.740
It'd be satisfying
to watch him do the grunt work.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.650
Or you could let
bygones be bygones.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.830
I'm so proud of you.

04:56.310 --> 04:57.970
Nice speech, Richie.

04:58.010 --> 05:00.710
Yeah? Not too long? 
No. No.

05:00.750 --> 05:04.190
They'd already gotten an
earful from you-know-who.

05:04.230 --> 05:06.540
Whoa. Excuse me. Uh,
how about a picture

05:06.580 --> 05:09.280
of all the Aerojet men
with their wives?

05:09.330 --> 05:10.890
Right this way.

05:14.420 --> 05:15.680
Coming?

05:15.720 --> 05:17.120
It's fine, Richie.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.510
I don't need to be
in the picture.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.120
Come on.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.250
Okay. And
say "cheese."

05:24.300 --> 05:25.430
Cheese.

05:26.470 --> 05:28.340
Whoa.

05:28.390 --> 05:30.350
You don't say cheese?

05:31.830 --> 05:34.390
Can I borrow you boys
for a minute?

05:34.440 --> 05:36.050
Yeah. I'll be back.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.790
We've gotten intelligence
that Von Braun's work

05:39.830 --> 05:41.790
on Hitler's "Vengeance Weapon,"
the V-2,

05:41.840 --> 05:43.620
is on the verge of completion.

05:43.660 --> 05:46.140
We need you boys to head
them off at the pass.

05:46.190 --> 05:48.360
We will. Well...
we'll do our very best.

05:48.410 --> 05:50.710
We're gonna blow 'em
out of the water.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.410
Good.
You have the full support

05:53.460 --> 05:54.630
of the War Department

05:54.670 --> 05:57.200
and an initial grant
of $500,000.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.900
If you can build an
operational missile...

05:59.940 --> 06:02.290
the sky's the limit.

06:02.330 --> 06:04.080
Before you go poppin'

06:04.120 --> 06:05.420
any more bottles of champagne,

06:05.470 --> 06:06.966
y'all are gonna need
to up your clearance.

06:06.990 --> 06:10.650
A project of this nature
requires the utmost secrecy.

06:10.690 --> 06:12.910
Army Intelligence
will be conducting interviews,

06:12.950 --> 06:14.430
digging into every aspect

06:14.480 --> 06:16.350
of your personal and
professional lives.

06:16.390 --> 06:18.350
We look forward to it.

06:18.390 --> 06:19.740
Enjoy the night.

06:19.790 --> 06:21.880
Because very soon...

06:21.920 --> 06:23.750
the real work begins.

06:25.180 --> 06:27.450
We've got a war to win.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.930
Thank you, General.

06:31.970 --> 06:33.970
Anything the military requires,

06:34.020 --> 06:36.320
we will do our best to provide.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.940
Can you picture it?
Half a million dollars.

06:44.990 --> 06:48.290
I'm more interested
in the "sky's the limit" part.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.990
The only difference
between a rocket and a missile

06:51.040 --> 06:53.080
is that a missile
carries an explosive.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.820
That's a fairly
significant difference.

06:55.870 --> 06:58.700
If we've got to kill a few Nazis
on the way to the moon,

06:58.740 --> 07:00.350
so be it.

07:00.390 --> 07:03.790
Assuming we get our clearances.

07:03.830 --> 07:08.440
It is not only enemies
on the battlefield we face...

07:08.490 --> 07:13.010
but enemies who live
across the street...

07:13.060 --> 07:15.410
who work
on the same assembly line

07:15.450 --> 07:17.410
or attend the same church,

07:17.450 --> 07:21.460
some even
within our own families!

07:23.200 --> 07:26.850
For as Satan disguises himself
as an angel of light,

07:26.900 --> 07:29.730
it is no surprise
that his minions

07:29.770 --> 07:34.820
Disguise themselves
as servants of righteousness!

07:34.860 --> 07:36.820
How were you prepared
to be consecrated?

07:36.860 --> 07:39.000
I obtained the four
powers of the Sphinx:

07:39.040 --> 07:41.430
Knowledge, Will,
Courage and Silence.

08:02.930 --> 08:05.500
This will help you
surmount your fears.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.030
The third degree requires

08:11.070 --> 08:13.200
a consummation to our faith

08:13.250 --> 08:16.160
not only in words but in action.

08:52.940 --> 08:55.550
Are the candidates ready
to pledge themselves

08:55.590 --> 08:57.940
in front of all those gathered?

09:00.770 --> 09:02.600
We are.
We are.

09:12.660 --> 09:15.530
There is no law beyond

09:15.570 --> 09:17.830
do what

09:17.880 --> 09:19.270
thou wilt.

09:59.270 --> 10:01.570
What is this? Alfred Miller?

10:01.620 --> 10:03.660
Yes. You've been ordered
to vacate the premises,

10:03.710 --> 10:05.190
effective immediately.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.800
We've paid our rent.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.100
You have no right.

10:08.150 --> 10:09.230
Let me talk to him.

10:09.280 --> 10:12.020
No, it won't do any good.

10:12.060 --> 10:15.410
This property's been acquired
by the archdiocese.

10:15.460 --> 10:17.200
Son of a bitch!

10:17.240 --> 10:19.810
He's the one you
should be locking up!

10:19.850 --> 10:20.850
Tell him, Susan!

10:20.900 --> 10:22.250
Yes, tell him, Susan.

10:22.290 --> 10:25.030
See if anyone believes you.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.030
Your depravity is apparent

10:27.080 --> 10:28.470
to all those here.

10:28.510 --> 10:30.690
"And lo, the beast was taken,

10:30.730 --> 10:32.470
"and with him the false prophet

10:32.520 --> 10:36.220
who wrought miracles
with which he deceived!"

10:37.260 --> 10:39.260
♪ Anima Christi

10:39.310 --> 10:42.920
♪ Sanctifica me Come, brothers. Sisters.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.790

Ah. Here we go, sweetheart.

12:38.470 --> 12:39.690
Here we go. Yes. Thank you.

12:39.730 --> 12:41.690
I suggested

12:41.730 --> 12:45.560
they go with neoclassic pieces
to match the style of the home,

12:45.610 --> 12:48.870
but my daughter-in-law wanted
something more unexpected.

12:48.910 --> 12:51.090
Oh! Well,
she certainly succeeded

12:51.130 --> 12:53.270
in that regard.

12:53.310 --> 12:56.440
I cannot tell you
how pleased I am to welcome you

12:56.490 --> 12:57.946
to the neighborhood.
Thank you, Mrs. Van Buren.

12:57.970 --> 12:59.400
We're thrilled to be here.

12:59.450 --> 13:03.060
So many magnificent homes
on Orange Grove have sat empty

13:03.100 --> 13:05.800
for far too long.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.280
And would you believe
the developers

13:07.320 --> 13:09.070
have begun snatching them up

13:09.110 --> 13:11.940
only to tear them down to create
their luxury apartments?

13:11.980 --> 13:13.330
As if such a thing exists.

13:13.370 --> 13:14.680
Nowhere near here, I hope.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.510
Oh, thankfully, not yet.

13:16.550 --> 13:18.340
But they are circling
like vultures.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.510
The Preservation Society
is doing what we can,

13:21.560 --> 13:24.080
but the more homes that sell
to the right sort of people,

13:24.120 --> 13:26.300
the better chance we have
of fending them off.

13:26.340 --> 13:28.560
What happened to the people
who lived here before?

13:28.610 --> 13:29.870
The Flemings?

13:29.910 --> 13:31.670
They lost everything
when the market crashed.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.480
Oh. Well, I thought
maybe they'd been murdered

13:34.530 --> 13:36.050
or died of some exotic illness.

13:36.090 --> 13:38.400
Oh! You'll have to
forgive my sister.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.270
She has
an over active imagination.

13:40.310 --> 13:42.050
It was a far too prosaic demise,

13:42.100 --> 13:43.750
I'm afraid.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.410
Not that I need to tell you.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.500
Thankfully,
my Jack has restored us

13:48.540 --> 13:50.280
to our rightful place.Oh.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.800
So you'll be moving in
with them?

13:51.850 --> 13:53.606
Not yet. But as soon as
there are grandchildren

13:53.630 --> 13:55.630
that need looking after...

13:55.680 --> 13:57.900
Is there something amusing?

13:59.940 --> 14:02.160
Patty, perhaps you'd like
to take Mrs. Van Buren

14:02.210 --> 14:03.680
to tour the grounds.

14:03.730 --> 14:06.080
It would be a pleasure.
Come along,

14:06.120 --> 14:08.120
Mrs. Van Buren.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.220
Oh! It's beautiful.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.650
You should teach that
girl some manners.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.220
Ones better suited to her
new living arrangement.

14:17.260 --> 14:19.440
It's not hermanners
I'm concerned with.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.960
You invite this woman over

14:21.010 --> 14:22.660
and start talking
about grandchildren,

14:22.700 --> 14:23.920
all without consulting me.

14:23.970 --> 14:26.100
Dear, I'm doing you a favor.

14:26.140 --> 14:28.670
You live
in Mildred's fiefdom now,

14:28.710 --> 14:32.410
and you make nice,
or she will make your life hell.

14:32.450 --> 14:34.190
As far as grandchildren,

14:34.240 --> 14:37.370
I wasn't aware I was saying
anything controversial.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.980
Not that it's any
of your business,

14:39.020 --> 14:41.290
but Jack and I have decided
to put children on hold.

14:41.330 --> 14:42.590
Indefinitely.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.250
I see.

14:46.290 --> 14:47.950
Does this have something to do

14:47.990 --> 14:49.910
with that little group of yours? No.

14:49.950 --> 14:51.520
It has to do with me
and what I want.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.820
Is that what they've
made you think?

14:53.870 --> 14:56.170
Well, we'll see
how long you last.

14:56.220 --> 14:57.610
The bigger the house,

14:57.650 --> 15:00.650
the more empty spaces
there are to fill.

16:07.110 --> 16:08.240
How's the search going?

16:08.290 --> 16:09.810
Poorly.

16:09.850 --> 16:12.160
Joan and I are still
at the hotel.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.860
And every landlord is
reluctant to rent to us,

16:15.900 --> 16:19.120
lest the archdiocese
come after them, too.

16:19.170 --> 16:20.820
Touché.

16:20.870 --> 16:22.650
That's what you're
supposed to say, isn't it?

16:22.690 --> 16:24.960
Come get some
before the ice melts.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.570
Have you talked to Crowley
about buying a place?

16:27.610 --> 16:30.440
That might better
secure your position.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.700
We lack the resources.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.620
What Thelema has to offer

16:34.660 --> 16:37.400
is not nearly as profitable
as your rockets.

16:37.450 --> 16:41.100
Well, you know I'd do anything
for you and Master Crowley,

16:41.150 --> 16:42.606
but at the moment,
all my money's tied up

16:42.630 --> 16:44.370
in my company
and this house, so...

16:44.410 --> 16:45.720
I understand.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.070
Now that the well
has been poisoned,

16:48.110 --> 16:50.160
we'll be forced to
move to a new city,

16:50.200 --> 16:52.070
most likely. Where?

16:52.110 --> 16:54.460
Burbank? Glendale?

16:54.510 --> 16:58.290
I was thinking
somewhere in Mexico.

16:59.340 --> 17:01.470
I'm tired

17:01.510 --> 17:02.536
of running from place to place.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.950
Wherever I go next,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.560
I want to be left alone.

17:05.609 --> 17:08.040
I might have another solution.

17:08.089 --> 17:10.480
Why not move the Agape here?

17:13.140 --> 17:16.530
That is asolution.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.319
I'm not sure it would
solve all of our problems.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.319
What about your father-in-law?

17:21.359 --> 17:23.060
He might have the church
behind him,

17:23.099 --> 17:25.280
but I've got the United States
military behind me.

17:25.319 --> 17:28.020
Well, it's not really up to me.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.850
We can't.

17:31.890 --> 17:34.680
Not with Patty living here.
It wouldn't be appropriate.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.590
All right, well, we're
gonna have to finish this later.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.640
I have to get to work.

17:45.170 --> 17:47.470
What do you think of his offer?

17:47.520 --> 17:50.650
Truthfully...

17:50.690 --> 17:54.260
I'm not sure
if this house is big enough

17:54.310 --> 17:56.310

is a member of
a fringe religion founded

28:00.910 --> 28:04.920

28:22.540 --> 28:24.540
Long time and no time.

28:24.590 --> 28:26.680
It's a blur.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.980

of California,

28:42.170 --> 28:45.390

No.

No, I didn't play sports.

29:41.190 --> 29:42.686
Do I look like someone
who plays sports?

29:42.710 --> 29:45.020
Marvel Parsons
and Ruth Whiteside.

29:45.060 --> 29:47.036
How did they meet? - I didn't
even need pickles,

29:47.060 --> 29:50.070
but I ended up
getting three jars.

29:50.110 --> 29:52.940
Mm-hmm.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.810
Mr. Parsons is reporting back
to an occultist

29:58.860 --> 30:00.616
named Aleister Crowley.
You're aware of that, correct?

30:00.640 --> 30:02.250
I am not aware of that.

30:02.290 --> 30:03.926
I don't know anything
about Aleister Crowley.

30:03.950 --> 30:05.300
But you know of him, correct?

30:05.340 --> 30:07.000
I've heard his name.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.520
Does the name Aleister Crowley
ring any bells to you?

30:09.560 --> 30:11.130
Uh, yeah.

30:11.170 --> 30:14.000
He's a teacher,
an adventurer, an explorer,

30:14.050 --> 30:15.700
a writer, a lot of things.

30:15.740 --> 30:16.896
Would you say
you want to be Mr. Crowley?

30:16.920 --> 30:19.090
No. I think there's a lot

30:19.140 --> 30:20.490
that can be learned
from him, no?

30:20.530 --> 30:21.570
Give me an example.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.580
The manifestation of one's will.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.710
You are described as
oppressive, egocentric,

30:25.750 --> 30:28.410
compulsive. Would you say
that's accurate, Mr. Parsons?

30:28.450 --> 30:30.516
And isn't it true that she was
once a practicing member

30:30.540 --> 30:32.590
of the cult? 
- I don't know much about that.

30:32.630 --> 30:35.070
Have you ever been to one of
Mr. Parsons' group meetings?

30:35.110 --> 30:36.070
I told you I haven't.

30:36.110 --> 30:38.110
He's never invited me.

30:38.160 --> 30:40.200
I'll tell you
what I think, Mr. Gui.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.046
I think you do not serve
the United States, you serve

30:42.070 --> 30:44.266
another, foreign master.
How can you question my loyalty?

30:44.290 --> 30:46.770
What kind of investigation
is this?

30:46.820 --> 30:48.226
I believe you
are a member of the cult

30:48.250 --> 30:49.576
and that you are lying
and that General Braxton

30:49.600 --> 30:50.780
knows you're lying.

30:50.820 --> 30:52.560
Mr. Gui, are
you a liar?

30:52.610 --> 30:54.170
Questions over
and over and I've been

30:54.220 --> 30:56.220
giving you the same answers over

30:56.260 --> 30:59.050
and over, so you tell me.

30:59.090 --> 31:00.920
Member of the Chinese
Communist Party.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.010
Is that not correct? - No.
I am an American.

31:03.050 --> 31:04.766
What the fuck does this
have to do with anything?

31:04.790 --> 31:06.790
I don't know
what you want me to say.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.450
You ask me to come in here,

31:08.490 --> 31:11.190
and I have told you
everything that I know.

31:11.230 --> 31:12.606
Where's Braxton?
Get Braxton in here. Please take a seat.

31:12.630 --> 31:13.956
I'm not fucking talking
to this guy anymore.

31:13.980 --> 31:16.110
Please take a seat! Get fucked.

31:16.150 --> 31:18.630
♪ Here you go.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.736
- Welcome, one and all.
- Joan, if you sort things out

31:20.760 --> 31:22.110
into the second bedroom...

31:22.160 --> 31:25.510
Joan... Joan will tell you
where to go.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.770
Yep... come, come, come, come.

31:27.810 --> 31:28.950
Come, come, come, come.

31:28.990 --> 31:30.860
Whoa-ho, whoa-ho.

31:30.910 --> 31:32.730
Welcome, welcome.
How was the traffic?

31:32.780 --> 31:34.130
Wasn't too bad.Okay.

31:34.170 --> 31:37.480
Joan will tell you where
everything needs to go.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.700
Joan?

31:38.740 --> 31:40.390
The third bedroom, I think.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.390
The third bedroom. Thank you.

31:48.310 --> 31:50.790
Ah, you can
just drop that there.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.320
Take this.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.240
I know all this must be
rather strange.

32:04.290 --> 32:07.680
It's fine. I'll finally get to
see what all the fuss is about.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.680
About that...

32:10.730 --> 32:13.600
I never wanted
to be like Virgil,

32:13.640 --> 32:16.080
pushing you into a faith
you hadn't chosen for yourself.

32:17.470 --> 32:19.430
Uh-huh.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.740
Though it might be
more difficult now, uh,

32:21.780 --> 32:23.780
I don't want you to feel
pressured to participate.

32:23.830 --> 32:26.260
I don't.

32:26.310 --> 32:28.220
Let me put it another way.

32:28.270 --> 32:32.880
Until you're ready, you
won't be able to participate.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.360
Who gets to decide if I'm ready?

32:35.400 --> 32:36.580
In the meantime, there will

32:36.620 --> 32:39.450
have to be certain ground rules.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.850
You're to respect the privacy
of all those living here.

32:42.890 --> 32:44.410
And during any kind
of gathering,

32:44.460 --> 32:45.850
you're not to leave
your bedroom.

32:45.890 --> 32:48.420
You can't be serious.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.420
I thought the whole point
of this

32:50.460 --> 32:53.470
was to live with less rules,
not more.

33:02.470 --> 33:04.090
The more I get to know you,

33:04.130 --> 33:06.440
the more I fall
in love with you.

33:06.480 --> 33:13.270
I've hesitated to do
the honorable thing, because...

33:13.310 --> 33:14.920
well, I-I was afraid
you might say no.

33:17.580 --> 33:22.710
But I-I've decided
i-it's time we took the plunge.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.500
So, w...

33:25.540 --> 33:27.330
Marisol, will you marry me?

33:27.370 --> 33:30.330
How'd you like that one?

33:30.370 --> 33:33.290
I think it was... sweet.

33:33.330 --> 33:35.120
She's gonna flip,
Mr. Onsted.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.640
Oh... s-so you think
she'll say yes?

33:37.680 --> 33:40.080
I mean, if she loves you,
why not?

33:40.120 --> 33:42.080
Can we see the ring?

33:52.310 --> 33:53.960
Never mind.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.570
She will definitely say yes.

33:55.610 --> 33:57.140
It was your grandmother's?

33:57.180 --> 33:59.440
N-No. Um...

33:59.490 --> 34:02.490
One of our first dates
was to see Wizard of Oz.

34:02.530 --> 34:04.800
H-Have you seen it?
- Of course.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.760
I thought an emerald
would be a nice reminder.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.150
More personal to me and Marisol.

34:10.190 --> 34:11.889
Mm... the city wasn't actually

34:11.940 --> 34:13.280
made of emeralds.

34:13.330 --> 34:15.940
It was an illusion made
by green-tinted glasses.

34:18.250 --> 34:20.070
Mr. Onsted's office.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.900
It's General Braxton.

34:21.949 --> 34:24.340
Shit. Where's Jack? The conference room.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.830
Have you seen the design for
our meteorological rocket?

34:32.870 --> 34:35.480
Braxton's on the line,
calling about our clearance.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.130
Should I answer it?

34:37.179 --> 34:39.699
No, Richard,
you should just stare at it.

34:39.750 --> 34:42.710
There's something
I need to tell you first.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.580
During my interview,
most of the questions

34:44.620 --> 34:45.800
they asked were about you.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.800
Or... not just you,
your religion.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.320
What did you say? 
- Everything I know.

34:50.370 --> 34:52.889
Jesus, Richard. - It's better
we're up-front.

34:52.929 --> 34:54.760
They'd find out
sooner or later, and besides,

34:54.800 --> 34:57.370
they knew most of it already. Just answer
the phone.

34:57.420 --> 35:00.550
Let's get this over with.

35:04.730 --> 35:07.300
General.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

35:07.340 --> 35:09.170
Congratulations, boys.

35:27.230 --> 35:29.930
Eres tan estúpido, Matias.

35:29.970 --> 35:31.840
¿Por qué harías eso?

35:31.880 --> 35:34.240
No eres un luchador, como papá.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.590
No me importa, no voy a verlo.

35:36.630 --> 35:38.110
¿Cómo puedes siquiera
preguntarme?

35:46.330 --> 35:47.940
You're home early.

35:47.990 --> 35:50.080
Who were you talking to?

35:50.120 --> 35:53.430
No one.
I'll fix us up some drinks.

35:59.040 --> 36:02.830

Oh, God, it's been so long

We... Your mother and I

37:17.770 --> 37:19.340
Tell Mother I'm fine.

37:19.380 --> 37:23.080
Well, that is a relief. Truly.

Thank you for contacting me,
Detective.

39:21.070 --> 39:24.770
I'll make sure DA Yates knows
how accommodating you've been.

39:24.810 --> 39:27.510
Uh, I'd keep your distance.

39:27.560 --> 39:30.040
Last guy he was with
didn't fare so well.

39:30.080 --> 39:32.910
I have faith in my protector.

39:35.910 --> 39:38.440
I'm not sure we've ever had
a chance to meet,

39:38.480 --> 39:40.130
but we are linked.

39:40.180 --> 39:42.050
Inexorably.

39:42.090 --> 39:45.660
You are the man who introduced
my stepdaughter, Susan,

39:45.700 --> 39:47.490
to that wretched cult

39:47.530 --> 39:50.710
and, by so doing,
ruined my family.

39:50.750 --> 39:53.670
And for the longest time,

39:53.710 --> 39:56.890
I have wanted to see you
placed exactly where you are.

39:56.930 --> 40:02.240
So much so
that I had a friend at the LAPD

40:02.290 --> 40:03.630
put a note in your file

40:03.680 --> 40:05.640
so that I could testify
to your deviance

40:05.680 --> 40:07.380
if you were ever arrested again.

40:07.420 --> 40:11.210
I wanted to make sure
that you were properly punished.

40:11.250 --> 40:15.250
It seems you've taken care
of that yourself.

40:16.910 --> 40:20.040
Why, it's not just
the confines, but the stench.

40:20.090 --> 40:23.790
Of course, I hear conditions are
even worse up at San Quentin.

40:24.830 --> 40:28.270
And while your case
might seem open and shut,

40:28.310 --> 40:31.310
there-there may be
mitigating circumstances.

40:31.360 --> 40:34.880
Perhaps that store owner
was in debt.

40:34.930 --> 40:36.890
Perhaps he was selling narcotics

40:36.930 --> 40:40.800
to people without prescriptions
in order to pay it.

40:40.850 --> 40:42.330
Now, depending on
who's advocating

40:42.370 --> 40:43.810
on your behalf,

40:43.850 --> 40:47.200
some could even see
what you did as justified.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.680
I just have one question.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.070
The last time anyone saw you,

40:51.120 --> 40:53.510
you nearly flew a plane
into Jack Parsons

40:53.550 --> 40:54.770
before stealing that plane

40:54.820 --> 40:56.470
and disappearing
to God knows where.

40:56.510 --> 40:59.080
So what I want to know is...

40:59.120 --> 41:01.080
do you still carry

41:01.130 --> 41:04.040
that same animosity
in your heart?

41:07.480 --> 41:08.660
Hey.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.100
Jack Parsons
means nothing to me!

41:15.580 --> 41:18.540
What the hell's going on?

41:21.410 --> 41:23.500
I'm fine.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.320
I-I'm fine!

41:25.370 --> 41:27.500
I got what I came for.

41:44.170 --> 41:46.130
What you're about to see

41:46.170 --> 41:47.960
has only been viewed
by a select group

41:48.000 --> 41:50.740
at the top levels of
the U.S. military and government

41:50.790 --> 41:52.610
and now by you.

41:52.660 --> 41:54.050
Goes without saying,

41:54.090 --> 41:55.570
but the details
of this conversation

41:55.620 --> 41:57.230
do not leave this room.

41:57.270 --> 42:00.530
This test footage was
shot inside Peenemunde,

42:00.580 --> 42:03.100
the base of the Nazi
secret missile project.

42:03.150 --> 42:06.100
A Polish POW working
as a slave laborer

42:06.150 --> 42:07.720
managed to escape with it

42:07.760 --> 42:10.500
and then he used it to secure
safe passage to America.

42:10.540 --> 42:13.070
We were hoping
you could study this film

42:13.110 --> 42:15.720
and glean whatever
you could use.

42:15.770 --> 42:18.420
You mean steal?

42:18.460 --> 42:21.340
There's no time to be prideful.

42:21.380 --> 42:23.210
Imagine what happens
if the Nazis

42:23.250 --> 42:26.170
perfect this technology first.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.040
Now's your chance
to put words into action.

42:30.090 --> 42:34.390
Lives will be saved or lost
depending on your success.

42:36.270 --> 42:38.750
Could we play
the film again, please?

42:52.240 --> 42:54.280
Do you have a moment?

42:54.330 --> 42:56.330
Sure.

42:58.550 --> 43:01.030
I am going to be frank,
Mr. Parsons. I don't like you.

43:01.070 --> 43:03.950
And, more to the point,
I don't trust you.

43:03.990 --> 43:06.430
So why did you... Sign off on
your security clearance?

43:06.470 --> 43:09.210
Given the importance
of the missile project,

43:09.250 --> 43:11.780
I was encouraged to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

43:11.820 --> 43:13.820
I wouldn't touch that.

43:13.870 --> 43:16.740
At the outbreak of the last war,
were you aware

43:16.780 --> 43:20.700
that your master, Aleister
Crowley, traveled to the U.S.

43:20.740 --> 43:24.570
and became involved in the
domestic pro-German movement?

43:24.620 --> 43:26.580
He later claimed to
be a double agent,

43:26.620 --> 43:27.686
working for British
intelligence.

43:27.710 --> 43:29.100
Was he?

43:29.140 --> 43:32.100
We have no idea
who he was working for then,

43:32.150 --> 43:33.670
or who he's working for now,

43:33.710 --> 43:36.370
and I thought maybe you
could help shed some light.

43:36.410 --> 43:40.330
I don't know. I've
never met the man.

43:40.370 --> 43:42.720
Perhaps I haven't made
myself clear, Mr. Parsons.

43:42.770 --> 43:47.640
Your work for the War Department
comes with certain expectations.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.430
Expectations that,
if failed to be met,

43:50.470 --> 43:53.430
will result in the loss of your
security clearance, or worse.

43:53.470 --> 43:55.080
So what do you want from me?

43:55.130 --> 43:57.260
Aleister Crowley's current
whereabouts are unknown.

43:57.300 --> 43:58.716
We need to know if
he's still in touch

43:58.740 --> 44:00.196
with his pro-German
contacts in the U.S.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.260
and if they're planning
anything.

44:02.310 --> 44:04.050
I already told you,
I don't know.

44:04.090 --> 44:06.360
Well, then, I assume we can
count on you to pass along

44:06.400 --> 44:09.790
any information that
you do find out?

44:09.840 --> 44:14.020
The world I live in requires
structure, Mr. Parsons.

44:14.060 --> 44:16.556
When an order is issued, we need
to know it will be carried out.

44:16.580 --> 44:18.800
There is no room
for "do what thou wilt,"

44:18.850 --> 44:22.330
and whatever the fuck else
it is you ascribe to.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.380
I understand.

44:54.620 --> 44:56.060
There you go.

44:56.100 --> 44:57.750
I call it Parsons Poison Punch.

44:57.800 --> 44:59.800
Mm.

44:59.840 --> 45:01.890
Ah, damn.

45:01.930 --> 45:03.110
That's potent.

45:03.150 --> 45:04.850
Pace yourself, baby.

45:04.890 --> 45:06.890
Let's not wear out our
welcome right out the gate.

45:06.940 --> 45:09.510
Walter, go as fast
as you damn well please.

45:09.550 --> 45:11.590
Uh-huh. Isn't that why we're here?

45:11.640 --> 45:13.340
Where's my wife?

45:13.380 --> 45:15.380
Has anyone seen my wife?

45:39.320 --> 45:40.880
My queen.

45:40.930 --> 45:42.930
It's "goddess" to you.

45:48.410 --> 45:51.240
What are you doing?

45:51.290 --> 45:57.030
O pan. Io Pan, Io Pan, Io Pan.

45:57.070 --> 46:00.250
I am a man.

46:00.300 --> 46:04.780
Do as thou wilt,
as a great god can.

46:04.820 --> 46:07.780
I am awake in the grip
of a snake.

46:07.820 --> 46:11.130
The eagle slashes
with beak and claw.

46:11.180 --> 46:14.920
The gods withdraw, the
great beasts come, Io Pan.

46:14.960 --> 46:17.570
I am gold, I am god.

46:17.620 --> 46:20.880
Flesh to thy bone,
flower to thy rod.

46:20.920 --> 46:23.490
With hoofs of steel,
I race on the rocks.

46:23.540 --> 46:28.930
And I rave and I rape
and I rip and I rend.

46:28.980 --> 46:32.680
Everlasting, world without end.

46:35.550 --> 46:37.940
Isn't everybody here already?

47:25.080 --> 47:27.730
Long time no see, Jack.
