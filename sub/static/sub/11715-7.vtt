WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:02.962
Hey.

00:04.839 --> 00:07.257
How about I trade you
my wheat toast

00:08.383 --> 00:09.551
for your bacon?

00:09.593 --> 00:10.636
(CHUCKLES)

00:12.095 --> 00:12.763
Pass.

00:17.643 --> 00:18.519
Hey!

00:19.854 --> 00:21.104
You should have
taken the trade.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.900
Hey, ease up on those
flapjacks, Tim.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.361
I'll take them.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.404
You gotta save room.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.281
I'm taking you
to the executive dining
room for lunch today.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.535
(INDIFFERENTLY)
Oh, yes.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.829
Don't get too excited.

00:36.871 --> 00:39.164
Sir, it's just that wher
you do something nice for m,

00:39.206 --> 00:40.415
you always have
an ulterior motive.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.667
(SHRILLY)
What? When?

00:43.961 --> 00:45.754
What...
Define "always."

00:45.796 --> 00:51.134
Every single time.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.720
Oh, yeah,
what about that time
I went on vacation,

00:52.761 --> 00:54.013
and I let you use
my apartment for a week?

00:54.054 --> 00:56.682
It was very generous
of me.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.266
You smelled a gas leak
and sent me in as a can.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.603
I ended up in the hospi.

01:02.688 --> 01:04.690
Oh, yeah.
The hospital.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.316
Where you get
an adjustable bed

01:06.358 --> 01:09.277
and all the Jell-O
you can eat.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.446
You even had that fun
old guy as a roommate.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.489
Yes. He was fun.

01:13.699 --> 01:14.992
Until 4:00 a.m.,
when he died.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.580
Not quietly,
I might add.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.500
What's wrong with
these pancakes?

01:23.542 --> 01:24.251
Oh. They're multigrain,.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.044
Yuck.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.549
RUSSELL: You know,

01:30.591 --> 01:32.300
I thought you had
earned lunch in
the fancy dining room,

01:32.342 --> 01:36.179
but forget it.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.181
You're actually
serious about this?

01:38.223 --> 01:40.601
Yes. I know
I'm not always
the greatest guy,

01:40.642 --> 01:42.978
but I'm trying to
make up for it here.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.730
If you don't wanna go, ,
but all I can do is try.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.983
Well, sir, perhaps
I misjudged the situati.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.276
No, no, no, no, no.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.278
Lunch sounds lovely.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.948
And I'm sorry I assumed
you had an ulterior mot.

01:53.989 --> 01:54.615
Yeah.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.911
Okay, here's
my ulterior motive.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.371
See this hot waitress
over there?

02:01.413 --> 02:04.792
I'm gonna try to nail h,
and you're gonna help m.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.126
You know,
at a certain point,

02:07.127 --> 02:13.425
the blame
is not entirely on you.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.427
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

02:18.806 --> 02:21.016
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not sc?

02:23.226 --> 02:27.314
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

02:28.315 --> 02:30.025
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

02:39.534 --> 02:45.248
Wow. So that's
the new chair.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.293
So what
do you think?
It's horrible.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.420
I was asking Jen.

02:50.462 --> 02:54.508
I think I speak
for everyone.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.051
You have been
against this chair

02:56.093 --> 02:57.385
ever since I showed it
to you on the website.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.929
That's not true.
I say we get six more

02:58.971 --> 03:03.642
and make our own
Tilt-A-Whirl.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.019
I like it.
It's kinda funky.

03:05.811 --> 03:06.603
Thank you, Jen.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.024
Hey. What do you think?

03:10.065 --> 03:11.483
Hey, what are you gonna
do with the crate?

03:12.985 --> 03:14.695
Just put it
in the dumpster.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.155
In fact, you guys
can take it down for me.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.364
Once we get rid
of that crate,

03:18.615 --> 03:21.535
we're stuck
with this piece
of crap forever.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.328
Liked it when
I saw it online.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.373
Love it even more now.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.208
(CHUCKLING)

03:29.250 --> 03:35.632
(WHINING)
I hate it.

03:35.674 --> 03:36.967
Hey, instead of
getting rid of this,

03:38.135 --> 03:39.136
can I have it?
Why?

03:40.888 --> 03:44.058
Pfft. Build a fort, yo.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.433
You know
you're an adult, right?

03:46.810 --> 03:48.937
Oh, no, it's not for me.
It's for Jen's nephew L.

03:48.979 --> 03:49.771
Right.

03:51.857 --> 03:52.733
It is.
Okay.

03:53.775 --> 03:57.362
And is Logan here
with us right now?

03:57.404 --> 03:58.572
He's real, okay?

03:59.531 --> 04:00.657
We're babysitting him
tomorrow,

04:00.699 --> 04:02.576
and he'd love it
if I had a fort.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.203
Fine, I hope that
"Logan" enjoys it.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.497
He's real.

04:08.207 --> 04:08.957
Sure.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.500
He is!
Sure.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.506
Well, if you hate it,
why did you buy it?

04:16.548 --> 04:18.092
It looked totally
different on the websit.

04:18.133 --> 04:22.763
It had all these cool
graphics and music and..

04:22.804 --> 04:24.639
Now that it's here, it'.
Oh, God, look at it!

04:30.645 --> 04:31.897
Well, is it at least
comfortable?

04:31.939 --> 04:32.814
It is not.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.652
I can barely hear anythg
in this stupid dome.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.073
Well, can you return it?

04:41.115 --> 04:44.034
Oh, what, and let Jeff
think he's right?

04:44.076 --> 04:45.493
No. I gotta figure out
a way to get rid of it

04:45.535 --> 04:47.996
without that
conniving weasel
thinking he won.

04:48.038 --> 04:51.125
(SIGHS)

04:51.166 --> 04:54.169
You guys have
a different relationship
than Adam and I.

04:54.211 --> 04:58.257
I know. It's sweet.
You're in love.

04:58.298 --> 05:07.474
But it all leads
to the same place.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.892
I been working
this waitress for awhil,

05:08.934 --> 05:11.145
but she won't give me
the time of day.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.520
It's 12:30.
May I go now?

05:13.730 --> 05:14.773
No. Here's the play.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.776
You're Mowgli,
an Iraqi street urchin

05:17.818 --> 05:19.278
that I rescued
from the war.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.487
Why? 'cause
I'm a great guy.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.157
That's what I do.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.616
And how plausible
is that, sir?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.618
I'm wearing a suit.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.578
And you're welcome
for that.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.413
Remember, that suit's
for wearing, not eating.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.374
Oh, I didn't
see you there.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.960
I was too busy
mentoring
the disadvantaged.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.879
I don't think
we've formally met.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.464
I'm Russell Dunbar.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.093
Yes, Dunbar, whose name
is on the building.

05:43.635 --> 05:44.803
Yawn. (LAUGHS)

05:44.845 --> 05:46.387
(MOUTHING) Wow.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.555
I'm Gwen.
Are you ready to order?

05:47.597 --> 05:49.224
You know what?

05:49.266 --> 05:50.558
Some people
find excessive wealth

05:50.600 --> 05:52.686
to be a burden,
but not me.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.062
It gives me a chance
to take on projects.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.690
Like this little guy.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.233
Look at him!
He's a cutie.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.484
All dressed up to eat.

06:01.278 --> 06:01.903
I'll give you guys
another minute.

06:01.945 --> 06:02.696
Okay.

06:05.448 --> 06:11.705
Why do I feel like
I'm doing
all the work here?

06:11.746 --> 06:12.539
(SIGHS)

06:13.665 --> 06:14.415
Uck.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.253
You know, Jeff,
I was thinking,

06:18.295 --> 06:20.088
even though
I really
love the chair,

06:20.130 --> 06:21.464
I just can't really
enjoy it that much

06:21.506 --> 06:24.801
knowing how much
you hate it.

06:24.843 --> 06:25.635
Really?

06:27.637 --> 06:29.430
Yeah. So I'm just gonna
pack it up and return i.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.893
Whoa, whoa... Are you gonna
need the crate for that?

06:36.188 --> 06:39.607
You can still make a fot
out of pillows and blan.

06:39.649 --> 06:40.817
That's bush league, bro!

06:42.819 --> 06:44.196
Why don't you guys
go get the crate,

06:44.238 --> 06:49.576
and we will go
get you some beers.

06:49.617 --> 06:53.163
Something
doesn't feel right.

06:53.205 --> 06:56.875
Well, you are kinda
jerking Logan around.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.544
Audrey caved way too easy.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.046
She said it's because
you don't like it.

07:01.088 --> 07:04.799
Yeah. But I hate
most stuff.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.719
That's never stopped her
from buying
anything anyone sells.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.847
Unless...

07:10.889 --> 07:14.642
She doesn't
like the chair.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.894
But she says
she loves the chair.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.020
Well, of course
she's not gonna

07:17.062 --> 07:20.023
come out
and admit she hates it.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.191
I'd destroy her.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.986
Wait a minute.
You hate the chair,

07:25.028 --> 07:27.030
and she's sending it ba.
You won.

07:27.072 --> 07:30.909
That was just a battle.
I wanna win the war.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.910
What war?
Marriage.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.915
Marriage isn't gonna
be like this for me and.

07:36.957 --> 07:37.916
Sure, it will.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.169
Uh, hey, uh, I was just
thinking, you know,

07:42.462 --> 07:45.006
what kind of selfish anl
is gonna make a wife

07:45.048 --> 07:49.594
return something that
she loves so much?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.263
Oh, um...
I appreciate that, hone,

07:52.139 --> 07:53.974
but I'm okay
sending it back.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.225
I'm confused,
because

07:57.727 --> 08:01.106
I know that
you love it so.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.232
Oh... I do.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.026
All right, well,
I'm not gonna ruin that.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.527
You love this chair.
Damn it, I love you.

08:06.569 --> 08:10.157
I'm gonna
learn to love it.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.450
Uh... (LAUGHS) Honey,

08:12.575 --> 08:14.077
you really
don't have to...
No, no, no.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.620
This chair is
a monument to our love.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.957
And it will stay right e
for the rest of our liv.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.585
In fact,
if you go before me

08:22.627 --> 08:23.503
I'll bury you in it.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.927
Come on,
I'm flailing here.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.637
I need you to play up
the refugee angle.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.431
(SIGHS)
Sir, do you honestly thk

08:35.432 --> 08:37.392
this woman believes
I'm a refugee?

08:37.434 --> 08:39.978
No. 'cause you're not
selling it.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.271
Here she comes.
Eat with your hands
or something.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.940
(FORK CLATTERS)

08:43.982 --> 08:46.193
Is everything
all right here?

08:46.234 --> 08:47.986
It's great with me.
But I think Mowgli here

08:49.112 --> 08:52.491
is a little afraid
of my soft-shell crab.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.284
He thinks it's one of
his angry eight-armed
gods or something.

08:54.326 --> 08:55.327
Argh!
It's not.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.371
It's just a crab.
Mmm!

08:58.997 --> 09:00.832
(MUFFLED) It's good.
No thunder, no light...

09:01.249 --> 09:04.169
(COUGHS)

09:04.211 --> 09:05.379
Oh, my God.
He's choking!

09:07.339 --> 09:09.883
Do you know
the Heimlich Maneuver?

09:09.924 --> 09:15.930
(INDIFFERENTLY)
Yes.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.057
(GRUNTING)

09:20.060 --> 09:21.102
(PANTING)

09:22.562 --> 09:23.230
Sir, are you all right?

09:23.271 --> 09:23.938
I...

09:26.233 --> 09:28.151
Do you know
mouth-to-mouth?

09:28.193 --> 09:29.444
(SIGHS)
This is not my day.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.122
(CLATTERING)

09:43.666 --> 09:44.376
Adam?

09:45.502 --> 09:50.048
(STUTTERS)
I'm down here.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.841
(CHUCKLES) Don't worry.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.469
Going to bed soon.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.096
Well, it's morning
already.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.306
You've been
doing this all night.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.849
Well, the loss of sleep
is gonna be worth it

09:59.891 --> 10:03.853
when you see the crown
moldings in here.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.397
All right, I'm gonna go
get some breakfast.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.647
You want me to bring you
back something?

10:06.689 --> 10:07.941
Sure. I'll take
a hot glue gun

10:07.982 --> 10:16.199
and some miniature curtains.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.951
So then I restored
Mr. Dunbar's breathing,

10:17.992 --> 10:19.369
and, uh...
He was fine.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.418
What were you thinking?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.548
Heimlich and
mouth-to-mouth too?

10:31.590 --> 10:33.883
You had two cracks
at not helping.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.718
What's going on?

10:35.760 --> 10:36.970
Timmy saved Russell's l.

10:37.011 --> 10:37.762
Why?

10:39.389 --> 10:40.390
I know, I know.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.935
The upshot was that Gwe,
the comely waitress,

10:44.811 --> 10:46.521
thought I was
quite heroic.

10:46.563 --> 10:50.317
I'm taking her
to dinner tonight.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.859
Is that the one
Russell was hitting on?

10:51.901 --> 10:52.860
The very same.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.615
You know,
saving Mr. Dunbar's life

10:57.491 --> 10:59.451
was neither
here nor there,

10:59.493 --> 11:00.785
but stealing the woman
he's trying to bed

11:00.827 --> 11:02.036
is remarkably satisfyin.

11:04.705 --> 11:08.335
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

11:08.376 --> 11:10.420
Huh.
Human Resources
wants to see me.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.341
To pick up some
sort of accolade or
commendation, no doubt.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.929
A sexual harassment
complaint against me?

11:21.973 --> 11:23.682
But that's absurd!
Who would make such a...

11:23.724 --> 11:29.022
Hey, Phyllis.
Sorry I'm late.

11:29.063 --> 11:29.814
You.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.818
Hello, Mr. Patel.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.236
Okay.
Let's get started.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.489
Phyllis, would you mind

11:37.531 --> 11:39.449
leaving the door open?

11:39.491 --> 11:48.583
I don't feel safe
around the predator.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.127
So have you
figured out why Jeff
wants to keep the chair?

11:51.169 --> 11:53.087
No. I quickly
ruled out he was
just being considerate.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.299
He obviously knows
I don't like the chair,

11:56.341 --> 11:59.469
and he's trying
to torture me.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.095
I really don't think
Adam and I are
gonna end up...

12:01.137 --> 12:03.306
(LAUGHS)
Of course you are.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.391
Just accept it.

12:05.724 --> 12:08.061
So what now?

12:08.102 --> 12:09.937
So we move the chair
into the baby's room.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.648
After a while,
Jeff will forget about ,

12:11.690 --> 12:12.857
and I can sneak it down
to the storage locker.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.775
Well, it's probably
for the best.

12:14.817 --> 12:20.407
That thing would
scare the hell
out of the baby.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.491
Oh, hey, Aud.
Hey...

12:24.994 --> 12:26.162
What did you do?

12:26.871 --> 12:28.956
Well, I asked myself,

12:28.998 --> 12:31.376
"Why would Audrey
hide the chair in
the baby's room?"

12:31.418 --> 12:35.046
"It must be because
I said I don't like it."

12:35.088 --> 12:39.467
That thought just
made my heart sink.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.510
You love this chair.
You should be able to
sit in it all the time.

12:40.552 --> 12:44.264
Come on.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.098
Thank you.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.104
Hot wing?

12:56.610 --> 12:57.985
Yes?
Would you like a hot wi?

12:58.777 --> 12:59.904
Chili peppers and spice.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.073
They're spicy?

13:03.324 --> 13:04.909
You got that from
the word spices, didn't?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.955
No, thanks.
Had a late lunch.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.039
Fine. More for me.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.250
What?

13:12.667 --> 13:13.543
Nothing.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.339
I gotta say,
this chair's growing on.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.048
What?

13:21.426 --> 13:28.057
(QUIETLY)
Really growing on me.

13:28.099 --> 13:31.102
Now, Mr. Dunbar claims
you put your lips on his
for roughly 20 seconds.

13:33.772 --> 13:34.855
Because he had passed out.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.818
Well, Phyllis,
as you've warned me before,
that does not make it o.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.449
It was mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.577
Tell me,
how does saving
someone's life

13:47.619 --> 13:49.162
bring about charges
of sexual harassment?

13:49.203 --> 13:50.288
I understand your conce,

13:51.122 --> 13:52.373
because I've met Mr. Dunbar.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.170
But I'm legally required
to go through this proc.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.172
Now, he also claims that
you came up behind him,

14:00.548 --> 14:02.550
put your arms around hi,
and made several thrust.

14:06.721 --> 14:07.639
He was like an animal.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.019
It was the
Heimlich Maneuver.
You know what?

14:13.060 --> 14:14.895
I am not going
to sit here and
entertain this nonsense.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.607
I have somewhere to be.
Oh, really?

14:17.649 --> 14:19.484
Where? To go on a date
with a certain waitress

14:19.526 --> 14:23.530
who works for
this very company?

14:23.571 --> 14:24.447
Oh, I get it.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.742
Very, very clever, Mr. Dunb.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.621
On this occasion,
I'm afraid this will no.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.039
Oh, really?

14:33.998 --> 14:35.958
Phyllis,
correct me if I'm wrong,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.294
but according
to paragraph 9,
subsection 4

14:39.086 --> 14:40.296
of the company handbook.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.589
You mean
the Dunbar Clause.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.341
(LAUGHS)

14:44.718 --> 14:46.553
Yes, thanks for
the shout out.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.596
As long as
there's an open
harassment complaint

14:48.638 --> 14:49.597
against an employee,

14:51.558 --> 14:53.601
they are forbidden
from interoffice relati.

14:56.521 --> 14:57.731
Technically,
that is correct.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.065
Amen, sister.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.569
You disgust me.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.028
Ooh!

15:06.280 --> 15:08.324
That certainly wasn't
the vibe you were
putting out yesterday.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.711
(SINGSONG)
Check it out.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.129
I finished the fort.
It took a while,

15:22.171 --> 15:26.843
but I think
it was worth taking
a vacation day for.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.135
(EXHALES)
Pretty sweet, huh?

15:29.721 --> 15:31.264
It's great, honey,
but I have bad news.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.643
My brother called,
and Logan's sick.
He's not coming.

15:35.685 --> 15:36.811
I see.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.357
And Logan had
your brother call you

15:41.399 --> 15:43.526
instead of
calling me himself?

15:43.568 --> 15:44.694
I'm really sorry.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.153
No, no. It's okay.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.573
Guess it was
just a waste of time.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.449
No, it wasn't!

15:50.533 --> 15:51.618
In fact,

15:53.160 --> 15:56.581
maybe you and I
should spend some
time in there together.

15:56.623 --> 16:00.126
Honey, there's kind of
a no girls allowed poli.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.377
Well, what if
that girl is me

16:02.044 --> 16:03.003
having sex with you?

16:08.384 --> 16:09.510
Okay.

16:10.762 --> 16:17.811
Maybe I can
waive the policy
just this once.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.479
Obviously,
there's no basis
for a complaint here.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.230
But clearly,
the two of you

16:21.272 --> 16:22.649
have a very
dysfunctional relations.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.778
Judge-y!

16:29.238 --> 16:30.865
I would recommend
that Mr. Patel

16:30.907 --> 16:36.162
be transferred
to another department.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.914
Well,
that seems a little ras.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.081
Can you put
that in writing?

16:42.209 --> 16:47.674
I'll give you a few
minutes to discuss.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.509
Okay. Don't worry.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.846
I'm not gonna
transfer you anywhere.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.849
We're gonna work this o.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.391
I have no desire
to work this out.

17:00.019 --> 17:00.979
You and I are through.

17:01.020 --> 17:01.855
Good-bye.

17:04.023 --> 17:09.863
(QUIETLY) Don't go.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.656
Excuse me?

17:11.698 --> 17:17.537
(MUTTERS)
Don't go.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.830
I'm sorry.
Are you saying "oil can?

17:22.333 --> 17:23.793
(SINGSONG)
Don't go.

17:25.795 --> 17:26.671
Why?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.550
Because I
(FADING) need you.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.221
Really?

17:38.808 --> 17:40.601
Okay. I'll stay
under one condition.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.730
I want you to thank me
for saving your life.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.025
Haven't I already
thanked you?

17:49.694 --> 17:50.987
No. Actually,
you accused me of rape.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.409
Wow. You really hear
what you wanna hear.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.371
Good-bye.
Ah.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.003
Thank you.

18:10.048 --> 18:10.965
For what?

18:14.134 --> 18:15.261
(MUTTERING)
Saving my life.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.767
You're welcome, sir.

18:20.808 --> 18:21.976
(SIGHS)
Okay. That's done.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.397
Now, let me take you out
for a nice dinner,
somewhere fancy.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.274
Is that really
the reason?

18:28.315 --> 18:31.110
You want to
make it up to me?

18:31.151 --> 18:42.038
You want me
to tell you now
or when we get there?

18:42.080 --> 18:43.205
Okay, look, I, uh...

18:44.832 --> 18:47.919
I haven't been
completely honest with .

18:47.961 --> 18:49.879
There's something
I need to confess
about the chair.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.465
Really?
And what is that?

18:52.506 --> 18:53.633
I just don't
think it works.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.509
Is that right?
Yes.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.388
Well, I can't say
that I'm surprised.

18:59.430 --> 19:02.100
Hopefully,
you learned
a little something.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.143
Oh, I did, and, uh,
I think I fixed the pro.

19:09.983 --> 19:10.900
What did you do?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.529
Well, when you
moved it out here,

19:15.571 --> 19:17.907
I realized
it didn't look right.
It needed a friend.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.034
Plus, you said it's
growing on you, right?

19:20.076 --> 19:20.994
I did say that.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.416
Besides, I thought
you'd get jealous
staring at me in my cha.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.293
Same day delivery?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.503
That couldn't
have been cheap.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.879
(LAUGHS)
Oh, it was not!

19:34.632 --> 19:36.467
But it was worth it
just to see the look
on your face.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.984
ADAM: (SIGHS)
I knew fort sex
would be awesome.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.863
JENNIFER: Yeah,
but it's pretty hot in .

19:56.904 --> 19:57.947
Yeah, it is.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.908
No. I mean I'm boiling.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.368
Oh.
I'll open the curtains.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.832
No, I have to
get out of here.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.083
(WOOD RATTLING)

20:09.917 --> 20:11.293
I can't.
The door's stuck!

20:11.335 --> 20:12.461
Move over.
Just let me try.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.755
I can't!
We're in a box!

20:16.757 --> 20:18.592
I knew I should
never have waived the
no girls allowed policy.

20:21.428 --> 20:24.598
Can you change the channel?

20:24.640 --> 20:25.599
What?
(GROANS)

20:29.311 --> 20:30.229
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

20:32.857 --> 20:35.317
What?
Can you please
change the channel?

20:35.359 --> 20:42.825
Hold on.
I'm getting another cal.

20:42.867 --> 20:43.743
Oh.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.703
Never was a Logan,
was there?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.748
No...
No, no, no!
