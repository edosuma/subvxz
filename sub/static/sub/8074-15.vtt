[music playing]

00:07.341 --> 00:08.209
Beck.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.477
Hey, Dad.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.180
When you were walking
around the house this morning,

00:12.213 --> 00:15.949
in and out of various rooms--
you know, observing things--

00:15.983 --> 00:18.752
you didn't happen to
see my pants, did you?

00:18.786 --> 00:20.154
You lost your pants?

00:20.188 --> 00:21.922
Not all of them.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.257
For your information,
little girl,

00:23.291 --> 00:25.926
I have a very important meeting
with my supervisor today,

00:25.959 --> 00:26.760
so I need my Dockers.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.132
I don't know where they are.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.032
Ask Mom.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.834
I can't ask your mother.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.103
The doctor said
she needed a week

00:35.136 --> 00:36.337
of total stress-free bedrest.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.640
And you know how she hates
it when I lose my pants.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.110
Then wear your regular pants.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.043
DJ: Dad?

00:43.077 --> 00:43.944
Just a minute, DJ.

00:43.977 --> 00:46.480
These are executives, Becky.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.283
I can't just waltz in there
with my regular pants.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.585
We'll never get that
new vending machine.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.586
So?

00:52.620 --> 00:54.622
So what am I supposed
to tell my men?

00:54.655 --> 00:56.524
That I was kidding about
the frozen snack treats?

00:56.557 --> 00:59.527
I'd have a riot on my hands.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.795
I gotta talk to Mom
about something for school.

01:01.829 --> 01:02.696
Whoa.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.031
Don't bother your mother.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.235
I will tell you everything
you need to know about school.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.569
You have to stay
until you're 16.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.372
Now scoot.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.141
Well, I need something
for a bake sale.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.309
And I told everybody she makes
the best cookies in town.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.811
Well, I'm sorry, DJ, but
your mother's just too sick

01:17.845 --> 01:19.580
to drive to the bakery.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.781
But I promised!

01:20.814 --> 01:21.682
DJ!

01:21.715 --> 01:23.151
ROSEANNE: You OK out there?

01:23.184 --> 01:26.154
Never felt younger
or more refreshed.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.221
Let's see.

01:27.255 --> 01:30.224
OK, we got frosting
and half a meatloaf.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.760
I'd get real scarce
after they sell that.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.128
Dan.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.896
Dan, how's Roseanne doing?
- Oh, she's resting.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.498
Listen, you didn't happen
to see a pair of pants

01:37.531 --> 01:39.533
on the front lawn when you
pulled up this morning?

01:39.567 --> 01:40.701
Things a little hectic, huh?

01:40.734 --> 01:41.602
You kidding?

01:41.635 --> 01:42.570
The kids have school.

01:42.603 --> 01:43.471
They want breakfast.

01:43.504 --> 01:44.705
People have to go to work.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.607
I tell you one thing.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.109
She sure picked one heck
of a day to get sick.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.212
Yeah, I hear you.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.747
Listen, could you do me a favor?

01:53.781 --> 01:54.648
I don't know.

01:54.682 --> 01:55.849
Does it involve strangling you?

01:55.883 --> 01:57.685
Because I'll make time for that.

01:57.718 --> 02:01.222
Well, I wouldn't ask, but
Fred and I need a babysitter

02:01.255 --> 02:02.423
for Tuesday night,
so we were hoping

02:02.456 --> 02:05.693
that maybe you guys could--

02:05.726 --> 02:06.660
never mind.

02:06.694 --> 02:07.695
No, no.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.796
Please finish.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.264
That we could, what?

02:10.298 --> 02:12.233
Recommend somebody?

02:12.266 --> 02:13.167
Sure.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.635
Who is the guy the
Lindberghs used?

02:14.668 --> 02:16.670
No.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.772
I'll get somebody
else to babysit.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.408
Someone who loves children.

02:20.441 --> 02:24.044
Get out of my way, DJ!

02:24.077 --> 02:25.979
I need the car just
as much as you do, Mark.

02:26.013 --> 02:26.914
Why should you get it?

02:26.947 --> 02:28.816
I'll give you
five good reasons.

02:28.849 --> 02:33.921
One, two, three, four, five.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.155
What are you going
to do with that?

02:35.189 --> 02:35.989
Wave at me?

02:38.826 --> 02:39.660
Ow.

02:39.693 --> 02:40.628
Ow!

02:40.661 --> 02:41.529
Come on.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.297
You're wearing a ring.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.633
Mr. Conner, will you please tell
Mark that he can't just have

02:45.666 --> 02:47.034
the car whenever he wants it?

02:47.067 --> 02:49.537
There's got to be a
fair way to settle this.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.372
I don't know what it is, so
I'd suggest a slap fight.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.442
Fine.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.009
You want to make this ugly?

02:56.043 --> 02:57.845
I'm getting Mrs. Conner.
- No!

02:57.878 --> 02:59.947
Everybody stop.

02:59.980 --> 03:00.914
OK.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.750
The doctor said
Mrs. Conner is sick

03:02.783 --> 03:05.719
and has to stay in bed
for the next week, OK?

03:05.753 --> 03:07.288
That means, for the
next seven days,

03:07.321 --> 03:10.724
under no circumstance is any
stress allowed in that bedroom.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.160
Therefore, you will
all grow up and take

03:13.193 --> 03:15.195
care of yourselves around here.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.464
You will cook for yourselves.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.731
You clean up after yourselves.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.032
And you think for yourselves.

03:19.066 --> 03:19.967
Got it?

03:20.000 --> 03:20.934
ALL: Yes.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.035
OK.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.338
Now everybody spread
out and find my pants.

03:24.372 --> 03:29.777
[theme music]

04:17.858 --> 04:19.059
Mom.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.761
You're here.
Instead of Fred.

04:20.794 --> 04:21.962
Hi, hi.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.532
It's just that I assumed
that, because Fred was

04:24.565 --> 04:26.567
babysitting when I left,
that when I returned,

04:26.600 --> 04:27.568
he would still be here.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.836
But-- but no.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.372
It's my mother.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.740
How nice.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.141
Oh, it's no trouble, really.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.576
Fred had to get
some more diapers,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.210
and I was here to
see Andy anyway.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.079
Well, you shouldn't have
to come all the way over here

04:39.112 --> 04:40.213
to see your grandson.

04:40.247 --> 04:43.283
What, did you lose the
picture we gave you?

04:43.317 --> 04:44.352
Hey, honey.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.986
Hey, Bev.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.721
OK, Andy, I got the diapers.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.424
Let her rip.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.826
Speaking of little
accidents, when I babysit,

04:52.860 --> 04:54.762
I'll need a list of
emergency numbers.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.129
Did you say babysit?

04:56.163 --> 04:57.865
Hey, honey, good news.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.467
You know how we talked
about going out on a date

04:59.500 --> 05:00.668
once a week?

05:00.701 --> 05:02.736
Well, Bev's offered to
babysit on Tuesday nights.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.641
Well, that's great.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.709
That's great.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.844
Is-- uh, but, uh,
see, there's trouble.

05:14.281 --> 05:21.288
Because, uh, I just gave
the job to this lady I met.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.523
What lady?

05:22.556 --> 05:23.557
What lady?

05:23.591 --> 05:28.896
The, uh-- the-- pff.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.864
I wrote the name down, but I--

05:30.898 --> 05:33.634
I left it.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.436
You want to leave
our baby with somebody

05:35.469 --> 05:37.505
whose name you don't even know?

05:37.538 --> 05:41.274
Well, Fred, like she's not
going to introduce herself.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.676
Why don't you call
her and tell her we'd

05:42.710 --> 05:44.478
rather have Andy's grandmother?

05:44.512 --> 05:45.379
Oh.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.380
Yeah.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.315
OK.

05:48.348 --> 05:52.185
Well, there's trouble
there because, uh--

05:52.219 --> 05:55.656
because she's deaf and she
won't hear the phone ring.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.290
I don't think
that's really somebody

05:57.324 --> 05:59.259
you want watching the child.

05:59.292 --> 06:02.696
She has eyes, Mother.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.932
Bev, would you mind
putting Andy down?

06:04.965 --> 06:06.867
Oh, I'd love it.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.670
I'll find some of his
cleaner stuffed animals

06:09.703 --> 06:11.839
to put in the crib with him.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.240
Come on.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.174
Come on.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.077
Thanks, Mom.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.648
(WHISPERING) Don't
you dare call her Mom.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.551
You may call her Bev or Sea Hag.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.656
What is bugging you?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.123
Have you lost your mind?

06:30.157 --> 06:33.727
I don't want that old
woman around the baby.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.296
You're being ridiculous.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.298
Bev gets along with him
great, and he loves her.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.700
Well, what does he know?

06:39.733 --> 06:42.369
He loves my house keys.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.471
Come on, Jackie.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.573
You've got to admit
whenever she comes over,

06:45.606 --> 06:47.775
his face just lights up.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.943
He is laughing at her.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.946
I taught him that.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.115
He looks like an angel.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.618
Oh, Jackie, I've
rearranged the changing

06:57.651 --> 06:58.952
table so it makes sense.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.091
Look, when she's
babysitting, you

07:04.124 --> 07:06.059
won't have to be around her.
Come on, Jackie.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.294
You owe it to the
kid to try to make

07:07.327 --> 07:08.562
things up with his grandmother.
- All right.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.863
Fine.

07:09.897 --> 07:10.864
It's just that none of this
would have happened if you

07:10.898 --> 07:14.768
hated her like a normal person.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.436
Well, time for
me to hit the hay.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.706
It's my turn to take care
of Andy in the morning.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.641
Oh, how nice
you have a husband

07:20.674 --> 07:25.178
who lets you sleep in while
he does your work for you.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.914
Mom, about Tuesday nights.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.448
Oh, my pleasure.

07:28.482 --> 07:32.152
I can see, as long as I have a
dust rag, I'll never be bored.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.588
Well, the job is
yours if you could

07:34.622 --> 07:36.289
just do me one little favor.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.091
- What, dear?
- Not a big favor.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.927
It's just something I've
always wanted you to do,

07:39.960 --> 07:41.194
and it'd make me
feel better about you

07:41.228 --> 07:43.096
spending time with Andy.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.331
Well, of course.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.599
What is it?

07:45.633 --> 07:47.901
Say that every single
thing you ever did in my life

07:47.935 --> 07:48.969
was wrong.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.303
What are you talking about?

07:50.337 --> 07:53.206
I'm-- I'm talking about
the way you raised me.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.175
Well, I don't
believe it was wrong.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.444
Oh, you don't
have to believe it.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.080
You just have to say it.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.148
You've lost your mind.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.851
You're not
allowed to write it.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.554
And you can't sing it.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.989
You must say it loud and clear.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.793
"Everything I did was wrong."

08:12.826 --> 08:15.095
I most certainly will not.

08:15.128 --> 08:18.165
Well, then you can't
babysit your grandson.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.568
But that's just wrong!

08:20.601 --> 08:22.469
Oh, that was close.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.370
Not close enough.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.713
Oh, man.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.014
This is so great, Dan.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.148
Look at me.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.617
I'm laying here in bed,
reading "The Enquirer,"

08:36.650 --> 08:38.719
eating this Cheez Whiz
right out of the bottle,

08:38.752 --> 08:42.022
just like the queen of England.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.257
Not quite, honey.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.861
The queen of England can't
get the "Dukes of Hazzard".

08:47.895 --> 08:49.630
Happy now?

08:49.663 --> 08:51.732
My foot's kind of
blocking my view here.

08:51.765 --> 08:52.566
Mark.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.874
That leg gets crossed again,
honey, just give us a call.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.880
I just wanted to tell
you that I finished working

09:06.914 --> 09:07.881
your shift at the diner.

09:07.915 --> 09:08.782
Oh, great.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.183
How were your tips?

09:10.217 --> 09:11.084
Pretty good.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.219
Great.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.654
Well, just leave them
up there on the dresser.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.596
Uh, Mrs. Conner,
there's kind of been

09:22.630 --> 09:25.198
something that's bothering me.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.200
Your-- your doctor
called the diner

09:27.234 --> 09:28.769
today because he
needed to reschedule

09:28.802 --> 09:29.870
your next appointment.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.205
I-- I hate myself for
even thinking this,

09:32.239 --> 09:34.507
but why would he
call you at the diner

09:34.541 --> 09:36.644
if he ordered you
to stay in bed?

09:36.677 --> 09:37.544
All right.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.446
I'll split the tips with you.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.714
Oh!

09:40.748 --> 09:42.515
You're faking this whole thing?

09:42.549 --> 09:43.917
Mrs. Conner.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.719
I know it's not my place,
but what you're doing

09:45.753 --> 09:46.687
is more than just wrong.

09:46.720 --> 09:51.725
It's-- it's-- oh,
it's really wrong.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.160
No it isn't.
I'm pregnant.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.561
I don't feel good.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.930
And I'm tired, and this is the
only way I could get a break.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.331
I understand.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.433
I just don't know if I
can go along with it.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.770
What's your favorite dinner?

10:02.803 --> 10:04.104
I don't know.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.439
Roast beef, mashed potatoes,
I guess, but what--

10:06.473 --> 10:08.075
Becky!

10:08.108 --> 10:10.744
I want you to make me roast
beef and mashed potatoes

10:10.778 --> 10:12.379
for dinner tonight.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.881
No fair.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.016
It's David's turn to cook.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.785
Well, David doesn't
have to cook anymore.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.519
He's, uh, above you now.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.658
Fine.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.659
Oh, God.

10:25.693 --> 10:28.428
Now I'm a part of this.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.030
Yeah, it's great,
isn't it, David?

10:30.063 --> 10:31.398
And this is just the beginning.

10:39.907 --> 10:40.774
Hi.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.742
Hey.

10:41.775 --> 10:42.810
Is dandruff shampoo
bad for dishes?

10:45.779 --> 10:46.847
Are they already in there?

10:46.880 --> 10:47.948
Uh-huh.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.417
No, it's fine.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.484
How's she doing?

10:51.518 --> 10:52.786
She's starting to
get a little bored.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.722
She's been counting the
cracks in the ceiling.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.956
Of course, there
weren't any till she

10:55.989 --> 10:58.358
got a hold of my nail gun.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.727
I gotta talk to
her about a problem.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.894
No, no, no.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.696
The doctor said no stress,
and no stress it is.

11:02.730 --> 11:03.596
Oh.

11:03.630 --> 11:04.732
OK.

11:04.765 --> 11:09.102
Well, then, guess I'll
just handle it myself.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.037
I'm an adult.

11:10.070 --> 11:10.871
That's good, Jackie.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.277
It's really important, Dan.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.380
I need to talk to somebody.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.049
This isn't a sex
problem, is it?

11:22.082 --> 11:22.950
No.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.184
No.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.419
I need someone who hates Mom.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.320
I'm listening.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.155
OK.

11:30.257 --> 11:34.161
So Mom volunteered to babysit
for free every Tuesday night,

11:34.194 --> 11:35.929
and Fred is pushing
me to let her do it.

11:35.963 --> 11:36.830
Yeah.

11:36.864 --> 11:37.731
So?

11:37.765 --> 11:38.866
So?

11:38.899 --> 11:41.568
So I'm not going to
trust her with Andy.

11:41.601 --> 11:44.537
She shouldn't be left alone
in a room with any baby.

11:44.571 --> 11:45.739
Why not?

11:45.773 --> 11:47.808
Roseanne always liked
having her babysit.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.542
Bev was great with her kids.

11:49.576 --> 11:53.346
Man, she could take a punch.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.983
No, Dan, you don't understand.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.451
Roseanne would never
approve of Mom babysitting.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.353
Roseanne hates our mother.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.889
Of course she does!

12:01.922 --> 12:03.924
Roseanne hates vegetables,
too, but she doesn't

12:03.957 --> 12:06.659
keep our family from corn.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.028
You're on Mom's side!

12:08.061 --> 12:10.497
No, I'm on you
and Fred's side.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.700
You leave the kid with Bev,
you two get a night out

12:13.733 --> 12:16.269
and all the dishes in
the cabinet get rewashed.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.338
Good God, Dan.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.707
You're talking about Mom!

12:20.740 --> 12:22.209
I know.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.410
What do you think's
going to happen?

12:23.443 --> 12:24.778
She's going to
forget to change him?

12:24.812 --> 12:26.046
Forget to feed him?

12:26.079 --> 12:29.983
Give him to the paperboy
instead of a tip?

12:30.017 --> 12:34.154
You really think your mother
would harm your child at all?

12:34.187 --> 12:41.494
Well, last time I went
out, when I came back,

12:41.528 --> 12:45.332
you didn't see the hat
she put on his head.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.834
Come on, Jackie.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.036
You're being ridiculous.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.103
You're not worried about Andy.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.704
You're doing this to punish Bev.

12:51.738 --> 12:54.107
So you're just doing
this to be wrong.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.145
Mom is a horrible woman.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.113
You and Roseanne may
let her near your kids,

13:00.147 --> 13:02.449
but I love my child.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.884
Yeah, right.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.085
If you could read
the instructions

13:05.118 --> 13:06.586
on a pack of condoms, you
wouldn't have a child.

13:10.657 --> 13:11.524
Hey.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.759
Hey.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.328
Uh, you know the name of
Mrs. Conner's gynecologist?

13:15.362 --> 13:16.229
Yeah.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.130
I mean, no.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.899
I mean, why?

13:18.932 --> 13:21.634
Well, I want to call him
and find out what's going on.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.003
Mrs. Conner doesn't
tell me much,

13:23.036 --> 13:25.038
and I'm afraid it's worse
than she's letting on.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.206
Oh, here it is.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.207
You know what?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.575
I'll call the
gynecologist for you.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.911
I-- I had to call him yesterday
for Mrs. Conner for something,

13:30.944 --> 13:32.745
and I kind of have
a relationship

13:32.779 --> 13:36.249
with her gynecologist.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.284
That's interesting, David.

13:46.059 --> 13:46.927
Hello, Doctor?

13:46.960 --> 13:47.760
It's David.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.067
Listen, we were just wondering
if Mrs. Conner's condition

13:54.101 --> 13:56.904
is any worse than she says.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.171
No.
Uh-huh.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.106
Yeah.

13:59.139 --> 14:02.275
It's exactly the
same as she says.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.176
OK, then.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.044
Thanks, Doctor.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.378
Wait a minute, David.

14:05.412 --> 14:08.848
Ask the doctor what
the condition's called.

14:08.882 --> 14:13.453
Uh, Mr. Conner wants to know
what this disease is called.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.388
Oh.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.224
Monoclynosiosis--

14:17.257 --> 14:18.458
David, hang up the phone.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.295
Goodbye, Doctor.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.869
That wasn't the
doctor, was it, David?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.608
No, sir.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.845
And Mrs. Conner is
faking it, isn't she?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.047
Yes, sir.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.283
I can't believe she did this!

14:43.316 --> 14:45.185
I had to sleep on the couch.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.886
I had to move the TV in there.

14:46.920 --> 14:50.157
I had to sleep on
the couch without TV!

14:50.190 --> 14:52.492
Well, come-- come on.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.760
She's not totally wrong.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.895
I mean, you did tell her
to take it a little easier,

14:55.929 --> 14:57.364
and a lot of people
might think that that

14:57.397 --> 14:59.299
meant to spend a week in bed.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.506
Well, then.

15:06.539 --> 15:10.077
In a way, I guess this
worked out for the best.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.344
You're not mad?

15:11.378 --> 15:12.245
Mad?

15:12.279 --> 15:13.146
No.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.814
But this is our
little secret, OK?

15:14.847 --> 15:16.849
ROSEANNE: Dan, I can't
stand this anymore!

15:16.883 --> 15:18.751
I'm gonna go for a little walk.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.653
Get my shoes, will you?

15:20.687 --> 15:22.389
No, no, no, no.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.492
The doctor said you
deserve your rest.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.094
And you're going to
get what you deserve.

15:29.829 --> 15:32.299
You're not going to kill
me, are you, Mr. Conner?

15:32.332 --> 15:33.833
Kill you?

15:33.866 --> 15:36.603
No.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.172
This isn't squirrel
season, David.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.140
I'm hunting bear.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.046
[knocking]

15:49.582 --> 15:50.517
Oh, my.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.884
It's Jackie.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.720
What can I do for you?

15:53.753 --> 15:55.822
If you've come to
insult me, why don't you

15:55.855 --> 15:57.757
just save it for my eulogy.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.359
You probably won't
have to wait long.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.260
Why?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.996
What have you heard?

16:03.030 --> 16:05.365
Why are you always so cruel?

16:05.398 --> 16:06.833
Mother, I didn't come
over here to fight.

16:06.866 --> 16:10.837
I came over to tell you that it
is OK for you to babysit Andy.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.139
Really?

16:12.172 --> 16:13.640
Yes.

16:13.673 --> 16:14.541
Thank you, Jackie.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.442
You're welcome.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.676
I'll see you on Tuesday.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.178
I'm glad you
changed your mind.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.681
I-- I really didn't understand
why you got so upset with me.

16:21.714 --> 16:26.253
I mean, I take very
good care of Andy.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.487
Yeah, I know, Mom.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.256
I'm crazy about that boy.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.491
I'm always very good to him.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.625
Yeah, I know.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.296
I just wish you could
have been good to me.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.898
Why, Jackie, I was.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.234
Not the way you are with Andy.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.470
I see you the way that you
look at him and you sing to him

16:43.503 --> 16:44.471
and you cuddle with him.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.674
And you never were
that way with me.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.680
I told myself that you
just didn't have it in you,

16:53.713 --> 16:56.249
but I mean, if you
can give it to Andy,

16:56.283 --> 16:58.218
I don't know why you
couldn't ever give it to me.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.520
What was so bad about me?

17:00.553 --> 17:01.788
Oh, Jackie.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.423
It wasn't you.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.624
Sure it was me.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.759
I mean, why was I so unlovable?

17:06.793 --> 17:09.096
It was me.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.363
What?

17:10.397 --> 17:13.566
Being a mother was just
a very hard job for me.

17:13.600 --> 17:18.305
It was all the
time, day and night.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.408
And I had your father to contend
with, not to mention Roseanne.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.809
OK.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.011
So, you know, I didn't get much
love because I had a cheating

17:25.044 --> 17:27.046
father and a difficult sister.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.282
No.

17:29.316 --> 17:35.322
It's because I was young and
just not very good at it.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.923
I'm sorry, Jackie.

17:36.956 --> 17:37.990
Now, Mom.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.659
I'm so, so sorry.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.161
Mom, don't.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.429
You deserve better.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.330
No.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.464
Mom, I wasn't perfect.

17:44.497 --> 17:48.568
I-- you know the dog Skippy?

17:48.601 --> 17:51.771
I put him to sleep after he
shredded your wedding dress.

17:51.804 --> 17:52.605
That wasn't Skippy.

17:57.877 --> 17:58.745
I forgive you.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.880
OK.

18:00.913 --> 18:05.618
You know, Jackie, the truth
is I'm sort of jealous of you.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.986
What?

18:07.019 --> 18:08.721
Yes.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.090
You waited until you
were older to have Andy.

18:11.124 --> 18:14.294
You're more settled,
more patient.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.396
You're a good mother.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.097
Wait.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.599
You're telling me that
I'm a good mother?

18:19.632 --> 18:21.168
You're-- you're
complimenting me?

18:21.201 --> 18:26.072
I can't-- this is like
a dream come true.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.842
I mean, this is like one of
those golden moments that comes

18:29.876 --> 18:31.978
around only once in a lifetime.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.813
And I also think
that you and Fred--

18:33.846 --> 18:37.550
Mom, don't, please,
say another word.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.485
Why?

18:38.518 --> 18:40.820
Mom, you're going
to say something

18:40.853 --> 18:42.855
mom-like and you're
just going to ruin it.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.858
You're going to-- you're
going to ruin my moment.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.260
No, I'm not.

18:47.294 --> 18:51.063
Oh, I think you will.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.265
I'm just going to say--

18:52.299 --> 18:53.666
I'm not listening to you.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.469
La la la la la la la.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.437
Well, I'll see you Tuesday.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.338
Shh.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.172
Shh.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.544
I'll bring my vacuum since
yours seems to be broken.

19:10.550 --> 19:11.351
No.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.355
No, it's still good.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.036
Hi, Dan.
How's it going?

19:30.069 --> 19:31.204
Pretty good.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.172
Quick question.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.675
You weren't just trying to head
out the front door, were you?

19:35.708 --> 19:36.576
Who?

19:36.609 --> 19:37.477
Me?

19:37.510 --> 19:40.213
Nah, I just came to.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.615
Because DJ said he saw you
heading out the front door,

19:42.649 --> 19:44.183
and when he called
for me, you did a uie

19:44.217 --> 19:46.786
and torqued bad in the bedroom.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.721
[whistling]

19:49.789 --> 19:51.624
Feet cold?

19:51.658 --> 19:53.493
No, not since I
put my shoes on.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.999
Roseanne, the
doctor said you were

20:00.032 --> 20:02.335
supposed to stay
in bed for a week,

20:02.369 --> 20:05.705
and that's what
you're going to do.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.641
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
have a few exits to block up.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.947
And I've nailed
the windows shut.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.317
Shoot!

20:17.350 --> 20:18.651
Roseanne?

20:18.685 --> 20:20.820
Oh, you're not too sick for
me to talk to you, are you?

20:20.853 --> 20:21.854
No.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.122
Get in here.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.891
I've been dying for the
sound of another human voice.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.893
Read me the ingredients
on this Cheez Whiz.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.094
You're not going
to believe this.

20:28.127 --> 20:31.598
Mom said she's a bad mother.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.832
What do you mean?

20:32.865 --> 20:35.568
Like-- like in the way that
Shaft was a bad mother?

20:40.206 --> 20:41.274
No, I'm serious.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.910
She said those exact words.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.044
Oh, my God.
OK.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.279
Well, you've got to
sit down and tell

20:46.313 --> 20:47.714
me every single detail of this.
- OK.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.615
I go over there--

20:48.648 --> 20:49.449
OK, now wait!

20:51.183 --> 20:52.051
All right.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.653
Now I'm ready.
- Um--

20:53.686 --> 20:54.621
Hey, hey, hey.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.022
What's going on in here?

20:56.055 --> 20:58.090
I'm just telling Roseanne this
really great stuff about Mom.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.392
No way.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.828
You bring up the name of,
there's going to be stress.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.095
- Shut up, Dan.
- See?

21:03.129 --> 21:04.764
Already it starts.
Let's go, Jackie.

21:04.797 --> 21:05.865
No.
Dan, no.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.934
She's been waiting 42
years to hear this.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.201
Then she can
wait another week.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.437
Let's go.
Doctor's orders.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.838
No.
OK, all right.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.806
Uh.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.175
OK.

21:16.208 --> 21:21.514
The doctor really never
said I had to stay in bed.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.849
Out, Jackie.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.618
Hey, you don't have to go
just because he tells you to.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.953
Yeah!

21:26.986 --> 21:28.821
You got a point.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.189
Dan, put me down!

21:30.222 --> 21:31.624
Put her down!

21:31.658 --> 21:32.559
Oh!

21:32.592 --> 21:34.193
Roseanne, my God,
it was glorious!

21:34.226 --> 21:35.528
DAN: Goodbye, Jackie.
- No, no, no.

21:35.562 --> 21:36.396
Wait!
Wait!

21:36.429 --> 21:38.865
Roseanne, she cried.
