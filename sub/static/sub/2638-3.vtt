WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:02.560
Fellow warriors,

00:02.630 --> 00:04.130
This is sheldor the conqueror.

00:04.200 --> 00:06.300
We are about to enter axidus' fortress.

00:06.360 --> 00:10.830
Now, this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.800
All right, barry, we'll wait for you again,

00:13.860 --> 00:16.800
But you really  should see a doctor.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.560
Sheldor is afk.

00:27.460 --> 00:30.430
Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?

00:30.500 --> 00:32.630
Yes. I can't get  my stupid door open.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.230
You appear to have put  your car key

00:34.300 --> 00:36.100
In the door lock-- are you aware of that?

00:37.300 --> 00:39.160
Yeah.

00:39.230 --> 00:41.660
All right, then.

00:42.700 --> 00:43.830
Damn it,

00:43.900 --> 00:45.660
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it!

00:45.730 --> 00:49.030
Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?

00:49.100 --> 00:52.130
I can't get the damn key out.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.630
Well, it's not surprising-- that baldwin lock on your door

00:54.700 --> 00:56.260
Uses traditional edge-mounted cylinders,

00:56.330 --> 00:57.960
Whereas the key for your volkswagen

00:58.030 --> 01:00.800
Uses a center cylinder system.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.860
Thank you, sheldon.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.700
You're welcome.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.800
Why did you put

01:08.860 --> 01:10.600
Your car key in the door lock?

01:10.660 --> 01:12.630
Why? I'll tell you why-- because today I had an audition,

01:12.700 --> 01:14.100
It took me two hours  to get there,

01:14.160 --> 01:15.400
I waited an hour for my turn,

01:15.460 --> 01:16.560
And before I could even start,

01:16.630 --> 01:18.160
They told me  I looked too midwest

01:18.230 --> 01:19.660
For the part.

01:19.730 --> 01:21.660
Too midwest-- what the hell  does that even mean?

01:21.730 --> 01:23.630
Well, the american midwest was mostly settled

01:23.700 --> 01:25.830
By scandinavian and germanic people.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.560
They have a characteristic facial bone structure...

01:28.630 --> 01:30.800
I know what it means, sheldon!

01:30.860 --> 01:33.700
God! you know, I have been in l.a. for almost two years now,

01:33.760 --> 01:35.960
And I haven't gotten  a single acting job.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.660
I've accomplished nothing, haven't gotten

01:37.730 --> 01:40.130
A raise at work, haven't   even had sex in six months,

01:40.200 --> 01:42.500
And just now, when I was    walking up those stairs,

01:42.560 --> 01:46.130
A fly flew in my mouth  and I ate it!

01:46.200 --> 01:49.360
Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures.

01:49.430 --> 01:50.930
They're almost pure protein.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.760
Oh, son of a bitch!

01:54.830 --> 01:57.100
I believe the condensation on your frozen foods

01:57.160 --> 01:59.760
Weakened the structural integrity of the bag.

02:04.130 --> 02:05.560
But returning to your key conundrum,

02:05.630 --> 02:07.100
Perhaps you should call a locksmith

02:07.160 --> 02:09.600
And have him  open the door for you. I did.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.860
He said he'll get here   when he gets here.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.900
And you're frustrated  because he phrased his reply

02:13.960 --> 02:16.660
In the form of a meaningless tautology? no!

02:16.730 --> 02:19.930
I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything

02:20.000 --> 02:23.260
And my breath smells like fly.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.400
There, there.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.560
Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?

02:38.630 --> 02:40.730
No, sheldon, I'd rather sit on this freezing-cold floor

02:40.800 --> 02:42.200
Sobbing like a three-year-old.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.100
All right, then.

02:45.430 --> 02:47.260
For heaven's sake.

02:49.660 --> 02:53.800
Just when I think I've gotten the hang of sarcasm.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:19.630 --> 03:21.400
Make yourself comfortable.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.460
Not there.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.060
Sheldor is back online.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.930
Sheldor?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.260
The conqueror.

04:00.330 --> 04:02.560
What are you doing?

04:03.760 --> 04:05.230
Afk.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.360
I'm playing

04:07.430 --> 04:09.230
Age of conan,   an online multiplayer game

04:09.300 --> 04:11.400
Set in the universe of robert e. howard's

04:11.460 --> 04:13.030
Conan the barbarian.

04:15.530 --> 04:18.700
Sheldor back online.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.029
What's "afk"?

04:20.100 --> 04:21.760
Afk.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.500
Away from keyboard.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.560
Oh, I see.

04:28.630 --> 04:32.260
What does that stand for?

04:35.860 --> 04:38.560
Oh, I see.

04:38.630 --> 04:42.260
Yes, but what does it stand for?

04:55.500 --> 04:58.460
Now, just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.

04:58.530 --> 05:02.030
Mm, I don't know-- can I see them in another color?

05:02.100 --> 05:04.100
Just click on them.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.260
Yeah, congratulations.

05:06.330 --> 05:07.760
You are now a level-three warrior.

05:09.060 --> 05:10.100
What's going on? leonard,  guess what?

05:10.160 --> 05:12.130
I'm a level-three warrior.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.960
Great.

05:14.030 --> 05:16.030
Do you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?

05:16.100 --> 05:18.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. shh.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.560
I only bring it up because your ice cream's melting

05:20.630 --> 05:22.760
And it's starting to attract wildlife.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.100
Uh-huh, yeah.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.930
Do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.200
It doesn't matter-- right now; you're looking for treasure.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.460
Wait, wait, where are you going?

05:32.530 --> 05:34.200
No, no. you're okay.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.260
If you run into crocodiles, just kick them with your boots.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.960
You want to catch me up?

05:42.030 --> 05:43.500
Well, let's see, uh,

05:43.560 --> 05:46.330
She attempted to open her apartment with her car key

05:46.400 --> 05:49.660
Because her face is overly midwestern, um...

05:49.730 --> 05:52.460
She hasn't had sex in six months...

05:52.530 --> 05:55.230
And she ate a fly.

05:58.730 --> 06:00.560
Seriously?  six months?

06:00.630 --> 06:01.900
Oh, my god!

06:01.960 --> 06:03.500
A treasure chest! I'm rich!

06:03.560 --> 06:07.360
Level three, and she thinks she's rich.

06:10.130 --> 06:12.560
What a newb.

06:13.930 --> 06:15.860
Okay...

06:15.930 --> 06:17.300
We're all set.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.430
Let her rip.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.930
Hi.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.560
Check it out-- it's just   corn starch and water.

06:38.860 --> 06:40.460
They make up

06:40.530 --> 06:42.600
A non-newtonian fluid, which is liquid,

06:42.660 --> 06:46.030
But solid under the percussive action of the speaker.

06:46.100 --> 06:49.100
That's what makes it get all funky.

06:51.460 --> 06:52.530
Yeah. okay.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.130
Uh, listen, I need to talk to sheldon.

06:59.430 --> 07:02.100
No, that's what she said-- sheldon.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.130
Okay, I'm in the game,

07:04.200 --> 07:06.200
And I've been exploring the island of tortage,

07:06.260 --> 07:08.260
But I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.

07:08.330 --> 07:09.600
Do you have the enchanted sword?

07:09.660 --> 07:11.160
No, no, I have a bronze dagger.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.430
You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.000
My lord, it's like the car key

07:15.060 --> 07:16.560
In your apartment door all over again.

07:16.630 --> 07:17.960
All right, how do I get the sword?

07:18.030 --> 07:19.530
Well, have you been to the temple of mishra?

07:19.600 --> 07:21.030
Is that the place on the hill with

07:21.100 --> 07:22.960
-The weird priest in front of it? -no, no, no, it's...

07:23.030 --> 07:24.300
Oh, for god's sakes, gimme.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.630
Thank you-- I really appreciate this.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.000
You're gonna have to learn

07:27.060 --> 07:28.230
To do these things for yourself, penny.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.800
Don't patronize me-- just get the sword!

07:32.630 --> 07:34.830
What the frack?

07:34.900 --> 07:36.660
Beats me.

07:36.730 --> 07:38.830
They were playing all last night, too.

07:38.900 --> 07:42.000
It's like some kind of weird comic book crossover.

07:42.060 --> 07:45.360
Like if hulk were dating peppermint patty.

07:45.430 --> 07:48.000
I always thought peppermint patty was a lesbian.

07:48.060 --> 07:50.000
No, that's marcie.

07:50.060 --> 07:53.260
Peppermint patty's just athletic.

07:53.330 --> 07:54.930
There you go-- one enchanted sword.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.260
All right, gimme, gimme, gimme.

07:56.330 --> 07:59.160
I want to kill the guard captain.

08:00.333 --> 08:05.260
That girl needs to get a life.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.800
Sheldon?

08:25.360 --> 08:26.530
Sheldon...

08:26.600 --> 08:29.160
Danger! danger!

08:29.230 --> 08:30.760
No danger--  it's just me, penny.

08:30.830 --> 08:31.530
Listen, I got to level 25

08:31.600 --> 08:33.360
And reached purple lotus swamp, right?

08:33.429 --> 08:35.630
You're in my bedroom.

08:35.700 --> 08:38.059
Leonard gave me an emergency key.

08:38.130 --> 08:39.400
People can't be in my bedroom.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.500
Well, can we go talk in the living room?

08:41.559 --> 08:43.730
I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.660
Why not?

08:45.730 --> 08:47.500
I spilled grape juice.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.430
Well, wear different pajamas.

08:50.430 --> 08:53.500
I can't wear different pajamas--  these are my monday pajamas.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.330
Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.160
Okay, fine, just tell me, is it too soon

08:57.230 --> 09:00.160
To join a quest to the black castle?

09:00.230 --> 09:01.630
-You were invited on a quest to the black castle? -yeah, yeah.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.560
By some guys in budapest.

09:04.630 --> 09:06.530
I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.500
Of course it's not--   you're only

09:07.560 --> 09:08.800
A level 25.

09:08.860 --> 09:10.160
These hungarians,

09:10.230 --> 09:13.600
They're just using you for dragon fodder.

09:13.660 --> 09:15.260
Really? boy, you'd think you could trust

09:15.330 --> 09:18.560
A horde of hungarian barbarians.

09:18.630 --> 09:20.360
Please, penny, enough.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.860
I have to sleep.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.730
Okay, well, you were great.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.200
Thanks.

09:30.260 --> 09:31.330
Oh. hey, leonard. listen,  don't go in sheldon's room--

09:31.900 --> 09:34.730
He's not wearing bottoms.

09:39.830 --> 09:43.260
Sheldon, you want  to catch me up again?

09:46.660 --> 09:48.000
People, I am very busy today.

09:48.060 --> 09:50.500
I realize that, dr. gablehauser,

09:50.560 --> 09:52.460
But it is your job, as  head of the department,

09:52.530 --> 09:53.860
To mediate all interdepartmental disputes.

09:53.930 --> 09:55.200
University policy manual,

09:55.260 --> 09:57.530
Chapter Four, Subsection Two:

09:57.600 --> 10:00.030
"mediation of interdepartmental disputes."

10:00.100 --> 10:02.060
Fine.

10:02.130 --> 10:04.230
Dr. winkle, what colorful name

10:04.300 --> 10:06.650
Did you call dr. cooper this time?

10:06.660 --> 10:09.400
Dr. dumb-ass.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.430
Dr. cooper, dr. winkle apologizes.

10:12.430 --> 10:13.400
No, I don't. no, she doesn't.

10:15.460 --> 10:16.660
Here's the problem.

10:16.730 --> 10:18.530
I was clearly signed up

10:18.600 --> 10:19.930
To use the mainframe in buckman 204,

10:20.000 --> 10:21.630
And dr. winkle just wantonly

10:21.700 --> 10:23.100
Ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.200
It wasn't even an official sign-up sheet.

10:25.260 --> 10:26.900
He printed it himself, and he put his name down

10:26.960 --> 10:28.430
On every slot for the next six months.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.660
If it is a crime

10:30.730 --> 10:33.760
To ensure that the university's resources

10:33.830 --> 10:35.460
Are not being squandered chasing subatomic wild geese,

10:35.530 --> 10:38.630
Then I plead guilty.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.400
Oh, penny!  do you need

10:41.460 --> 10:43.560
To get that, dr. cooper?

10:43.630 --> 10:45.800
-God, no. -Well, don't turn it off,

10:45.860 --> 10:47.260
You might miss your call from the nobel committee

10:47.330 --> 10:49.560
Letting you know you've been nominated

10:49.630 --> 10:51.860
As dumb-ass laureate of the year.

10:51.930 --> 10:54.160
Oh, yeah? well...

10:54.260 --> 10:56.900
You wouldn't even be nominated.

11:00.960 --> 11:01.900
Dr. gablehauser,  I have a series

11:01.960 --> 11:04.830
Of important calculations  and simulations to run.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.430
All she's doing is reducing irrelevant data

11:06.500 --> 11:07.700
And making a mock...

11:07.760 --> 11:09.030
Excuse me.

11:09.030 --> 11:10.580
Gablehauser.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.540
It's for you.

11:16.570 --> 11:17.960
Hello?

11:17.960 --> 11:20.490
Penny, this is not a good time.

11:21.650 --> 11:22.560
No, I told you,

11:22.560 --> 11:24.720
You're not prepared for the sanctum of burning souls.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.960
You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest

11:28.960 --> 11:30.620
And one should be a level 35 healer.

11:31.470 --> 11:33.070
Penny, I can't log on and help you.

11:34.380 --> 11:35.810
We'll talk when I get home.

11:42.050 --> 11:44.300
I'm not getting the computing time, am i?

11:44.300 --> 11:46.260
Dumb-ass.

11:50.490 --> 11:53.390
Leonard, you have to do something about penny.

11:53.390 --> 11:54.850
She is interfering with my sleep,

11:54.850 --> 11:56.260
She's interfering with my work,

11:56.260 --> 11:59.030
And if I had another significant aspect of my life,

11:59.030 --> 12:00.690
I'm sure she'd be interfering with that, too.

12:02.810 --> 12:04.510
Why should I do something?

12:04.510 --> 12:07.040
You're the one who introduced  her to online gaming. yes,

12:07.040 --> 12:09.600
But you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in.

12:11.210 --> 12:12.540
If you'd simply restrained yourself,

12:12.540 --> 12:13.760
None of this would be happening.

12:15.170 --> 12:16.690
Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone?

12:16.690 --> 12:18.420
I did, I told her,

12:18.420 --> 12:21.050
I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter.

12:21.050 --> 12:23.070
I even changed my facebook status to

12:23.070 --> 12:25.330
"sheldon cooper wishes penny would leave him alone."

12:25.330 --> 12:26.430
I don't know what else to do.

12:27.260 --> 12:29.730
Well, what am I supposed to do?

12:29.730 --> 12:31.690
I don't know, but if you don't figure something out,

12:31.690 --> 12:34.840
I warn you, I shall become very difficult to live with.

12:36.650 --> 12:39.260
You mean up until now we've been experiencing

12:39.260 --> 12:40.790
The happy, fun-time Sheldon?

12:41.960 --> 12:43.710
Yes. I'll go talk to her.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.540
No, fritz, I need you on my flank.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.160
No, I don't know german.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.530
Flankenzei, flankenzei.

12:55.030 --> 12:56.580
Hey, Penny.Busy.

12:57.670 --> 12:58.710
Yeah, I see that.

12:58.710 --> 13:00.130
Shouldn't you be at work?

13:00.130 --> 13:01.200
I don't work on mondays.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.140
It's thursday.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.150
Listen, Penny...

13:07.150 --> 13:08.260
Queen penelope, afk.

13:08.260 --> 13:09.550
What...?

13:14.620 --> 13:15.780
Here's the thing.

13:15.780 --> 13:18.980
Sometimes people, good people,

13:18.980 --> 13:20.420
Yeah, they start playing these games

13:20.420 --> 13:21.100
And they find themselves--

13:21.100 --> 13:22.910
Through no fault of their own--

13:22.910 --> 13:25.020
You know, kind of...addicted.

13:25.020 --> 13:27.650
Yeah, get to the point.I'm about to level up here.

13:27.650 --> 13:29.550
It's just if a person doesn't have

13:29.550 --> 13:31.350
A sense of achievement in their real life,

13:31.350 --> 13:33.240
It's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world

13:33.240 --> 13:35.380
Where they can get a false sense of accomplishment.

13:35.380 --> 13:36.820
Yeah, jabber, jabber, jabber.okay, boys,

13:36.820 --> 13:38.110
Queen penelope's back online.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.320
Penny, you've got...

13:42.320 --> 13:44.620
Cheetos in your hair.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.030
Oh. thanks.

13:59.690 --> 14:01.980
Hey, Penny, it's me again, Leonard.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.810
Leonard, I said not now.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.990
I know, I'm just a little concerned about you.

14:06.990 --> 14:08.270
I said not now!

14:08.270 --> 14:09.770
Okay, maybe later.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.330
Hey, guys.

14:14.850 --> 14:15.650
Hey, what's with him?

14:15.650 --> 14:17.650
Penny's been keeping him up at night.

14:19.750 --> 14:20.950
Me, too.

14:24.770 --> 14:27.230
But probably in a different way.

14:28.010 --> 14:29.840
She's gotten really hooked on age of conan.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.070
She's playing nonstop.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.100
Ah, yes, online gaming addiction.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.310
There's nothing worse than having

14:34.310 --> 14:37.030
That multi-player monkey on your back.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.680
Sheldon, wake up!

14:39.680 --> 14:41.140
Danger! danger!

14:42.990 --> 14:44.290
Afternoon, men.

14:44.290 --> 14:45.800
Sheldon.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.160
Oh, yeah?

14:48.160 --> 14:49.700
Well, your attempt at juvenilizing me

14:49.700 --> 14:52.040
By excluding me from the set of adult males, just...

14:52.040 --> 14:54.590
Oh, I'm too tired to do this.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.550
Right.I heard you've been pulling all-nighters

14:57.550 --> 14:58.550
With middle earth barbie.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.550
She comes into my room.

15:01.550 --> 15:03.320
No one's supposed to be in my room.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.430
I would postulate that she's escaping into the online world

15:07.430 --> 15:09.410
To compensate for her sexual frustration.

15:09.410 --> 15:10.490
I do that, too.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.280
But probably in a different way.

15:16.990 --> 15:18.940
That's not what she's doing, Leslie.

15:18.940 --> 15:21.110
She's just trying to shore up her self-esteem.

15:21.110 --> 15:22.340
It has nothing to do with sex.

15:22.340 --> 15:23.830
Everything has to do with sex.

15:23.830 --> 15:26.120
Mm, testify.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.290
I'm not touching that.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.230
Leslie, you are way off base here.

15:34.230 --> 15:35.190
Hang on, leonard.

15:35.190 --> 15:37.660
While I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist

15:37.660 --> 15:39.340
Or a human being,for that matter,

15:39.340 --> 15:41.410
We have to

15:42.900 --> 15:45.430
Concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields

15:45.500 --> 15:47.360
Of promiscuity and general sluttiness.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.300
Thank you.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.000
My point is that tinker bell just needs to get her some.

15:53.060 --> 15:54.200
Some what?

15:54.260 --> 15:56.060
Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.

15:58.830 --> 16:00.800
I'll take the bullet.

16:02.860 --> 16:04.860
Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.930
Enough debate, I'm going to take action.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.400
Excuse me.

16:08.500 --> 16:13.530
Are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?

16:13.600 --> 16:14.900
No.

16:15.430 --> 16:17.700
Would you like to be?

16:20.760 --> 16:21.700
Uh... sure, why not?

16:21.760 --> 16:22.760
Sheldon...

16:24.360 --> 16:25.730
Puh-puh-puh.

16:25.800 --> 16:31.030
Can I have your phone number?

16:31.560 --> 16:32.500
Uh... yeah.

16:43.130 --> 16:44.260
There. problem solved.

16:48.860 --> 16:50.600
Dumb-ass.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.100
Okay, I'm at the gate to the treasury of the ancients.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.230
I'm going in.

17:00.300 --> 17:01.900
Stay close to the wall.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.599
Avoid the mummies. got it.

17:04.660 --> 17:07.530
I must say you're playing very well for a woman of 23.

17:07.599 --> 17:08.630
Twenty-two.

17:08.730 --> 17:10.230
Right, 22.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.930
Oh, here come the mummies.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.300
Which spell do I use, the hateful strike

17:16.359 --> 17:17.630
Or the frenzy stance?

17:17.700 --> 17:19.460
What happened to the rest of your group?

17:19.530 --> 17:22.430
I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.060
Frenzy stance.

17:25.123 --> 17:26.123
Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.900
So, listen, would you describe your ideal vacation

17:30.960 --> 17:34.100
As a wild adventure to unknown lands

17:34.560 --> 17:36.530
Or staying at home curled up with a good book?

17:36.600 --> 17:38.200
What?

17:38.260 --> 17:40.960
These are market research questions.

17:41.030 --> 17:42.800
I'm filling out the online registration for your game.

17:42.860 --> 17:44.900
Oh, okay, wild adventure.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.860
Oh, frenzy stance isn't working.

17:46.930 --> 17:48.130
Die, you undead mummy, die!

17:48.200 --> 17:49.300
Drink a healing potion.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.130
Thank you. you're welcome.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.630
Anyhow, on a scale of one to five,

17:56.700 --> 17:59.230
With one being always initiated by him

17:59.300 --> 18:02.730
And five being always initiated by you,

18:02.800 --> 18:04.700
How do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?

18:04.760 --> 18:06.500
That's on the registration?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.260
Oh, yes, it's quite extensive.

18:08.330 --> 18:09.600
But if we complete it,

18:09.660 --> 18:11.460
You get a free expansion pack.

18:11.530 --> 18:13.260
75 additional quests.

18:13.330 --> 18:14.930
Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.460
I'm a big ol' five.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.900
Good to know.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.159
Big ol' five.

18:29.460 --> 18:30.830
Hello.

18:30.900 --> 18:32.110
Hi.

18:32.130 --> 18:34.200
Leonard, this is tom.

18:38.330 --> 18:39.900
Hi, tom.   sheldon...

18:43.460 --> 18:46.130
Didn't I explain to you

18:46.200 --> 18:47.200
About your little mistake in the cafeteria?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.260
Yes,

18:48.330 --> 18:50.060
You were very clear.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.460
As was everyone else at the table.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.860
Tom, however, has been chosen by science

18:55.930 --> 18:57.400
As a suitable mate for penny.

18:57.460 --> 19:00.000
Chosen by science?

19:00.200 --> 19:03.030
Well, what passes for science on dating sites.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.630
They claim to use heuristic algorithms,

19:05.700 --> 19:08.260
But it may well be hokum.

19:08.330 --> 19:09.660
You got penny to sign up for online dating?

19:09.730 --> 19:11.830
No, of course not.

19:12.030 --> 19:15.760
See, I used trickery and deceit.

19:15.830 --> 19:18.100
This is bad.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.630
Tom is a paramedic with the fire department,

19:19.700 --> 19:21.400
But he's going to med school at night.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.600
He likes the outdoors

19:24.660 --> 19:28.060
And, uh, strong women who initiate sex.

19:28.130 --> 19:30.630
Really, really bad.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.100
I'm surprised you struck out with penny.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.360
Apparently, she's a big ol' five.

19:36.430 --> 19:37.400
Sheldon, what do you want?

19:37.460 --> 19:38.430
Oh, good,

19:38.500 --> 19:39.900
You got my note.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.230
Penny, I'd like you to meet tom.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.700
Penny, this is tom.

19:42.760 --> 19:43.860
Tom, may I present penny.

19:43.930 --> 19:44.800
Hi, penny.

19:44.860 --> 19:46.200
Yeah, hey. listen...

19:46.260 --> 19:47.430
As long as I'm here,

19:47.500 --> 19:48.330
I'm on a quest with a bunch of newbs.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.430
They don't know what they're doing.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.530
We've got one assassin,

19:50.600 --> 19:51.730
Three spell casters and no tank.

19:51.800 --> 19:52.960
Can we talk about this later?

19:53.030 --> 19:55.300
No, no, no, no. I need you now.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.360
Wouldn't you prefer to socialize with tom,

19:56.830 --> 19:59.230
Who is a sexually passive outdoorsman?

20:01.300 --> 20:02.660
Whatever. I'll figure it out myself.

20:04.330 --> 20:07.300
Bye, penny.

20:07.330 --> 20:11.700
I'm sorry, dude, she didn't look anything like her picture.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.060
They never do

20:19.730 --> 20:21.020
hello, fair penny.

20:21.750 --> 20:22.300
Who are you?

20:22.530 --> 20:24.200
It is i, sir howard of wolowitz.

20:26.750 --> 20:29.320
Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing

20:29.630 --> 20:31.840
Followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?

20:33.190 --> 20:34.550
Yeah, sure, why not?

20:38.030 --> 20:38.990
Oh, my god, I need help.
