00:00.548 --> 00:01.782
Previously on Cardinal-

00:01.815 --> 00:03.784
Same winter
clothes as Robert Quillen

00:03.818 --> 00:05.319
so there should be another video.

00:05.353 --> 00:06.720
I love you, Barry.

00:06.755 --> 00:08.055
I'm so sorry, Barry.

00:08.089 --> 00:10.124
You know why this is happening.

00:10.158 --> 00:12.513
- Detective John Cardinal.
- Taj Roy.

00:12.547 --> 00:14.528
If the cops start asking
you about your past,

00:14.562 --> 00:15.596
I'm not part of it.

00:15.630 --> 00:17.398
But it's possible they
weren't the real targets.

00:17.432 --> 00:18.732
You and Barry were.

00:18.767 --> 00:20.701
You think
these are contract killings?

00:20.735 --> 00:21.769
I need to be closer.

00:21.803 --> 00:22.870
I need to be a part of it.

00:22.904 --> 00:24.104
I need to them to see me.

00:24.139 --> 00:25.506
I need them to know.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.374
Do you want me to finish this,
Scott?

00:27.742 --> 00:29.109
Yes.

00:29.144 --> 00:30.311
I'm on my way to you.

00:30.345 --> 00:32.179
I want you to pack a bag
and get Julie and Alex

00:32.213 --> 00:33.180
ready to move.

01:04.756 --> 01:12.758
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

01:31.354 --> 01:32.754
It's another abduction.

01:33.923 --> 01:35.824
Victim's wife says he was making dinner

01:35.858 --> 01:37.859
when she thinks someone
entered the house.

01:38.928 --> 01:42.377
Lise, it's Josh McNider.

01:45.368 --> 01:47.502
- What about his family?
- No, no, they're okay.

01:47.536 --> 01:48.903
How long since he's been taken?

01:48.938 --> 01:50.138
Just over an hour.

01:50.740 --> 01:53.008
His wife was in the shower.
She didn't hear anything.

01:53.042 --> 01:54.242
Also, um-

01:55.378 --> 01:57.379
Josh's minivan is missing and,

01:58.648 --> 02:00.482
there was blood in the garage.

02:02.518 --> 02:03.918
His wife, Julie, where is she now?

02:03.953 --> 02:05.387
She's in the bedroom.

02:11.527 --> 02:13.528
You should be the one to interview her.

03:00.609 --> 03:01.943
Mrs. McNider,

03:03.546 --> 03:05.046
uh, I'm Detective Cardinal.

03:05.081 --> 03:06.281
This is,

03:06.315 --> 03:08.550
you know of course, Detective Delorme.

03:08.584 --> 03:10.652
Can you help us to understand

03:10.686 --> 03:12.821
what might have happened here tonight?

03:12.855 --> 03:14.299
It's like those other people, isn't it?

03:14.334 --> 03:17.559
No, no, we do not know that.

03:17.593 --> 03:19.266
But you'll find Josh?

03:21.197 --> 03:23.498
I promise we'll do
everything we can, Julie.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.841
Thank you.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.739
Has anyone visited the house?

03:39.648 --> 03:41.015
Have you noticed anyone new

03:41.050 --> 03:42.484
hanging around the neighbourhood?

03:42.518 --> 03:44.583
No. I don't think so.

03:45.488 --> 03:47.322
Did you and Josh ever discuss the-

03:49.158 --> 03:52.627
the murders of Robert Quillen
or Adele LeBlanc?

03:52.661 --> 03:54.662
Just when we saw it on the news.

03:56.065 --> 03:58.466
Did he know anyone involved?

03:58.501 --> 03:59.567
He didn't say.

03:59.602 --> 04:01.369
I think he would've mentioned that.

04:02.004 --> 04:05.073
Julie,
do you know if he spoke with anyone

04:05.107 --> 04:07.275
this evening before all of this happened?

04:07.309 --> 04:08.510
No.

04:10.646 --> 04:12.046
His father, Ken.

04:13.482 --> 04:16.050
When I looked at Josh's phone I saw

04:16.084 --> 04:18.086
he had missed four of Ken's calls.

04:22.270 --> 04:24.372
Do you mind if we have
a look at that phone?

04:29.265 --> 04:30.799
Spatter stains.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.234
Somebody got hit hard.

04:34.503 --> 04:36.638
The drag mark would indicate

04:36.672 --> 04:39.073
the victim was put in a vehicle here.

04:40.075 --> 04:43.678
So he must've subdued
Josh to get him this far.

04:43.712 --> 04:46.114
He's used a stun gun on other victims.

04:47.149 --> 04:48.683
So why hit him here?

04:48.717 --> 04:50.518
I think we have a third party.

04:50.553 --> 04:52.086
It was sitting there when we arrived.

04:52.121 --> 04:54.689
Airport tag with today's date.

04:54.723 --> 04:56.524
Iqaluit to Algonquin Bay.

04:56.559 --> 04:59.160
Name tag says Kenneth McNider.

05:00.129 --> 05:01.496
That's Josh's father.

05:02.665 --> 05:03.865
Josh's phone.

05:05.067 --> 05:07.469
Missed calls and a
voicemail from his father

05:07.503 --> 05:09.504
sounding like he knew
something was coming.

05:09.538 --> 05:11.372
Well the killer took Ken too.

05:13.042 --> 05:15.143
And I found another feather.

05:15.177 --> 05:17.412
The feathers are a message.

05:17.446 --> 05:19.681
But for the victims or us?

05:19.715 --> 05:21.616
Kular hasn't found
anything on these falcons,

05:21.650 --> 05:24.085
apart from them coming
back into the area.

05:25.350 --> 05:27.155
Ken wasn't supposed to be here.

05:28.123 --> 05:29.757
It wasn't ever part of the plan.

05:31.148 --> 05:34.484
It's like he just
stumbled on the abduction.

05:35.431 --> 05:37.265
How did Ken know someone was coming?

05:37.299 --> 05:39.033
He could've heard about Adele and Robert

05:39.068 --> 05:40.935
while he was out of town.

05:40.970 --> 05:43.638
I mean they've become national news.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.280
Yeah, or maybe Sheila tipped him off.

05:48.010 --> 05:49.777
We should check phone records.

05:49.812 --> 05:51.446
She'll fight us on the warrant.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.881
She knows all the judges.

05:55.117 --> 05:56.518
Okay, well,

05:56.819 --> 05:58.486
whatever this is all about,

05:58.521 --> 06:00.522
it looks like Ken is mixed up in it.

06:01.323 --> 06:03.758
Then Josh is supposed
to be the next victim,

06:04.727 --> 06:06.127
the next video.

06:09.565 --> 06:12.133
Twice now we've been too late.

07:33.549 --> 07:35.897
Hey, you say hi to daddy.

07:36.285 --> 07:37.885
Say something!

07:37.920 --> 07:39.754
Say hi to your dad!

07:39.788 --> 07:41.222
Say something!

07:53.636 --> 07:54.869
Hey.

07:55.604 --> 07:56.871
It's getting late.

07:56.905 --> 07:58.906
Maybe we should call it a night?

08:00.376 --> 08:01.609
We're gonna need

08:01.644 --> 08:04.512
better language here on harm reduction.

08:04.546 --> 08:07.348
Okay, but we've still got weeks.

08:07.383 --> 08:09.347
Five dead last month, Paige.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.559
We need this statement to be undeniable.

08:13.288 --> 08:14.522
Okay.

08:15.257 --> 08:16.691
We'll dig back in.

08:34.743 --> 08:37.245
Help!

08:37.279 --> 08:38.746
Grandpa!

09:19.381 --> 09:21.282
Josh, pickup the phone.

09:21.317 --> 09:22.350
I'm on my way to you.

09:22.384 --> 09:23.551
I want you to pack a bag

09:23.586 --> 09:25.386
and get Julie and Alex ready to move.

09:25.421 --> 09:26.888
Just do it.

09:26.922 --> 09:28.923
And don't go anywhere 'til I arrive.

09:31.148 --> 09:33.949
McNider's assistant said he cut
a business trip to Nunavut short

09:33.984 --> 09:35.484
and flew home yesterday.

09:35.519 --> 09:37.219
Wasn't scheduled back for another week.

09:37.254 --> 09:38.954
Well we think someone
must've tipped Ken off

09:38.989 --> 09:40.623
that Josh was at risk.

09:41.424 --> 09:43.325
Where are we on phone records?

09:43.360 --> 09:45.027
Waiting for call back.

09:45.061 --> 09:46.829
You said there was a baby cam?

09:46.863 --> 09:48.998
Low resolution, but it got the guy.

09:49.032 --> 09:50.199
Face is a bit pixellated

09:50.233 --> 09:52.501
but I'm looking for a database match now.

09:52.536 --> 09:53.969
Keep at it.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.122
I'm gonna ask for a
surveillance team on Sheila.

10:00.923 --> 10:02.523
What changed your mind?

10:02.548 --> 10:03.981
Ken McNider,

10:04.006 --> 10:05.606
I think there's a history there.

10:06.749 --> 10:07.949
Why?

10:08.351 --> 10:10.920
Well a few years ago there
were some sawmill workers

10:10.954 --> 10:13.756
up by Moose Lake making
some trouble in town.

10:13.790 --> 10:15.907
I asked Sheila to talk to the owner,

10:15.931 --> 10:18.232
make sure some of the worst
offenders were sent home.

10:18.267 --> 10:20.001
It was Ken McNider?

10:20.035 --> 10:21.502
Yeah, she refused.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.770
It was weird.

10:22.805 --> 10:24.372
Never known her to back
down from a fight,

10:24.406 --> 10:26.040
but she flat out said no.

10:27.643 --> 10:30.378
We tried to make the
connection on our end.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.546
You do the same.

10:31.580 --> 10:32.880
Yeah.

10:32.915 --> 10:33.915
All right.

10:33.949 --> 10:35.016
Thanks, Jerry.

10:35.050 --> 10:36.250
Okay, John.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.820
How well did you know Ken?

10:43.492 --> 10:45.326
He's hard to get to know.

10:46.495 --> 10:48.129
Successful.

10:48.163 --> 10:50.465
Big in the resource industry here,

10:50.499 --> 10:52.133
logging, mining.

10:53.802 --> 10:55.069
Busy.

10:55.104 --> 10:56.270
Big ego.

10:56.305 --> 10:57.939
He and Josh close?

10:58.774 --> 11:00.842
Josh is surveying for his company

11:00.876 --> 11:03.111
so they see each other all the time.

11:03.145 --> 11:04.378
You know,

11:05.581 --> 11:06.981
they were all close.

11:08.884 --> 11:11.619
Sheila has no kids, just Robert.

11:11.653 --> 11:13.121
Barry only had his mom.

11:15.991 --> 11:18.025
If the killer took Ken,

11:18.060 --> 11:20.194
what happens to the Josh video?

11:20.229 --> 11:22.463
If he wants the loved ones to see it,

11:28.670 --> 11:30.505
Maybe there won't be a video.

11:32.207 --> 11:34.575
He can make Ken watch in person.

11:37.846 --> 11:40.915
If he wanted to hurt him,
what better way?

12:11.146 --> 12:12.747
This is for you.

12:14.216 --> 12:15.650
Answer it.

12:21.456 --> 12:22.623
They're gonna be
listening to your phones

12:22.658 --> 12:23.925
if they're not already.

12:23.959 --> 12:25.359
I just needed to talk to you.

12:26.295 --> 12:28.029
I heard the cops were
all over Ken's place.

12:28.063 --> 12:29.497
Do you know what happened?

12:30.566 --> 12:31.766
I can imagine.

12:32.267 --> 12:33.701
Did you call them, Sheila?

12:35.571 --> 12:36.838
No.

12:36.872 --> 12:38.072
You're lying.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.742
He's coming after us now.

12:43.212 --> 12:45.246
Are you not worried about your daughter?

12:45.280 --> 12:46.681
Yeah, of course I am.

12:46.715 --> 12:49.150
And you really think
you can protect her from this?

12:49.184 --> 12:52.486
The minute we go to the
cops I lose my daughter.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.355
I'm not gonna let that happen.

12:55.090 --> 12:57.225
We never should've been
in the woods that day.

12:57.259 --> 12:58.860
Yeah, well,

12:58.894 --> 13:00.328
nobody forced us, Sheila.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.796
Any of us.

13:02.664 --> 13:06.300
Look, let me protect
you until this is over.

13:06.335 --> 13:07.935
I think I'm fine where I am.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.915
Hey.

13:24.953 --> 13:26.721
Here's the image from the baby cam.

13:27.789 --> 13:29.223
I checked this image against cases

13:29.258 --> 13:30.756
with the Wade Kleiss knifing MO.

13:30.791 --> 13:33.598
- Okay.
- This is Neil Cuthbert.

13:33.632 --> 13:34.762
That's him.

13:34.796 --> 13:36.597
Released six years ago,
attempted murder charge,

13:36.632 --> 13:37.965
pled down to assault.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.301
He was in the same prison
at the same time as Kleiss.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.303
Detained in Quebec three years ago

13:42.337 --> 13:44.338
after a suspected contract killing.

13:45.641 --> 13:48.309
A professional, like we thought.

13:48.343 --> 13:50.278
Let's release his photo.

13:50.312 --> 13:51.545
If we think he's from out of town

13:51.580 --> 13:53.614
let's look into rental properties,

13:53.649 --> 13:55.149
anything with snowmobile access.

13:55.183 --> 13:56.150
Yeah.

13:56.184 --> 13:58.252
Let's get uniforms knocking on doors.

14:49.135 --> 14:51.405
Help!

15:07.422 --> 15:08.622
Help!

15:09.424 --> 15:11.811
Help!

16:25.820 --> 16:27.257
Aha, yep.

16:27.291 --> 16:28.429
Thanks.

16:29.722 --> 16:30.956
What is it?

16:32.859 --> 16:34.493
They found Josh's minivan.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.313
Anything?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.315
From the snowfall looks like
it's been here a few hours,

16:56.349 --> 16:57.649
probably dumped soon after the abduction.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.917
The contents match

16:58.952 --> 17:01.653
what Julie McNider said
was in the vehicle.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.155
He left in another car.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.190
Yeah, or he had someone waiting.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.827
I'm about to measure those
treads for track search.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.127
Well it's a straight shot out of town,

17:10.163 --> 17:11.972
they could be anywhere by now.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.334
Yeah, it's been hours
now and we have nothing.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.136
You can't blame yourself.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.372
Why not?

17:20.705 --> 17:21.940
You do.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.011
We should get back.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.738
There.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.107
You've seen him.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.246
He hasn't seen me yet.

18:41.214 --> 18:43.582
Or what I'm doing to his son.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.599
Hello, Ken.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.767
He's seen my face.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.579
My photograph's out there.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.406
So now he dies and then we leave.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.041
It's not finished yet.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.945
One of them could still
do the right thing.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.447
Oh, it's finished, Scott.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.885
It's my money.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.354
It's my rules.

19:19.133 --> 19:21.426
We're gonna take Ken to the quarry

19:21.461 --> 19:24.863
so that he can see his
child die in the cold.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.132
And then there's just one left.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.600
That's never gonna happen.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.303
I won't pay you the rest
if you don't do what I say.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.007
You're gonna pay me my money.

19:36.456 --> 19:37.756
And then I'm going.

19:37.781 --> 19:39.181
I won't let you.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.147
This gun

19:42.882 --> 19:47.953
is to make sure that you
do what you need to do.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.822
You wanted me to save
him for you so I did.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.294
Look at him.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.347
He's right there, Scott,

19:58.498 --> 20:00.365
and you're gonna kill him.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.068
It's the easiest thing
in the world to do.

20:04.891 --> 20:06.725
Use your hands.

20:07.113 --> 20:08.747
Use a hammer.

20:09.715 --> 20:11.149
I don't really care.

20:11.990 --> 20:13.991
But you're gonna get it done.

23:50.144 --> 23:51.544
Any news?

23:51.579 --> 23:52.812
No.

23:55.816 --> 23:56.950
Coffee?

23:56.984 --> 23:58.184
Sure.

24:01.121 --> 24:02.522
Who's that out there?

24:03.457 --> 24:05.291
No need to worry about that.

24:08.362 --> 24:10.196
Those detectives put him there?

24:11.031 --> 24:12.935
No, I did.

24:16.256 --> 24:18.090
To protect me or watch me?

24:21.208 --> 24:23.042
Do you know Ken McNider, Sheila?

24:23.811 --> 24:25.645
Like you knew Barry LeBlanc?

24:31.652 --> 24:33.653
Whatever this is we can fix it.

24:34.221 --> 24:35.655
There's no fixing this.

24:39.360 --> 24:42.061
Why did you quit Watershed Forestry?

24:42.096 --> 24:43.296
What?

24:43.564 --> 24:44.764
Simple question.

24:49.710 --> 24:51.344
I had a better opportunity.

24:55.242 --> 24:56.476
That's it?

24:58.012 --> 24:59.648
Yeah, Jerry, that's it.

25:04.432 --> 25:05.632
Okay then.

25:35.883 --> 25:36.849
Jerry.

25:36.884 --> 25:38.284
John.

25:38.318 --> 25:40.553
So I tracked down the surveyor

25:40.587 --> 25:42.288
that worked at Watershed Forestry

25:42.322 --> 25:44.123
with Sheila and Barry.

25:44.158 --> 25:45.725
Okay.

25:45.759 --> 25:49.128
He remembers that Barry
had a thing for Sheila,

25:49.163 --> 25:50.596
unrequited I guess.

25:51.298 --> 25:52.932
But he also remembered that

25:52.966 --> 25:56.569
they both quit out of the blue
a week apart from each other.

25:56.603 --> 25:58.237
And he thought that was strange?

25:58.272 --> 26:01.040
Job pays well, benefits and all that.

26:01.075 --> 26:03.476
Wasn't much good work around
here at the time, so yeah.

26:04.504 --> 26:06.279
He remember when that was?

26:06.980 --> 26:09.343
'98, '99, somewhere in there.

26:11.078 --> 26:12.312
Thanks, Jerry.

26:15.289 --> 26:16.489
Um-

26:20.094 --> 26:22.361
I'm not protecting her anymore.

26:35.676 --> 26:37.143
Hey, we got a 911 call.

26:37.177 --> 26:40.012
A fight at a cabin, possible gunshot.

26:40.047 --> 26:43.015
It's a rental property,
snowmobile access.

26:44.118 --> 26:45.318
Where?

26:45.352 --> 26:46.552
Ridgeline Road.

27:25.159 --> 27:26.292
We have a body in the shed.

27:26.326 --> 27:28.161
Roger that, sending support.

27:32.866 --> 27:34.267
That's our suspect.

27:35.202 --> 27:36.602
Neil Cuthbert.

27:39.239 --> 27:40.439
He's dead.

27:43.844 --> 27:45.144
Clear.

27:45.179 --> 27:46.379
Clear.

27:48.782 --> 27:50.016
Clear.

27:51.852 --> 27:53.052
Clear here.

28:00.928 --> 28:02.929
Okay, blood from multiple sources,

28:03.904 --> 28:07.140
someone fled or was
taken out of here hurt.

28:08.168 --> 28:10.002
The call said two men fighting.

28:10.838 --> 28:12.839
One of the men fighting was him.

28:13.774 --> 28:15.408
So who was the other?

28:16.243 --> 28:17.677
His employer?

28:17.711 --> 28:19.111
Has to be.

28:20.581 --> 28:22.615
Josh or Ken would've come straight to us.

28:26.066 --> 28:28.148
And if there was a third person

28:28.989 --> 28:32.091
he's now the only one
who knows where they are.

28:32.404 --> 28:33.605
Yep.

30:40.564 --> 30:42.398
Do you know where we are now?

30:43.467 --> 30:45.969
Not far from where we
first met, actually.

30:46.696 --> 30:49.298
In what's left of the Aagimaak Forest.

30:50.774 --> 30:52.175
The old sawmill.

30:53.244 --> 30:54.577
Your old sawmill.

30:55.746 --> 30:56.946
Yeah,

30:58.082 --> 31:00.925
you did well off this land, didn't you?

31:02.753 --> 31:04.587
Do you remember my name?

31:07.851 --> 31:09.434
It's Scott.

31:10.674 --> 31:11.874
Riley.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.231
I know all your names now too.

31:17.568 --> 31:18.968
Sheila Gagne.

31:20.471 --> 31:21.905
Barry LeBlanc.

31:22.806 --> 31:24.240
Taj Roy.

31:25.009 --> 31:26.609
And you,

31:26.644 --> 31:27.844
Ken.

31:30.247 --> 31:32.165
What happened was an accident.

31:36.613 --> 31:39.615
Was it an accident to leave
me in jail for 20 years, Ken?

31:41.792 --> 31:43.193
How did you find us?

31:45.329 --> 31:46.763
I had time.

32:05.983 --> 32:08.418
See, where I served my sentence,

32:09.667 --> 32:11.704
some of the inmates had this.

32:13.257 --> 32:14.657
The dot in the centre, that's them.

32:14.692 --> 32:18.228
And the other four dots make
up the walls of their cell.

32:18.262 --> 32:21.064
But for me it's different,
you see, because all four dots

32:25.035 --> 32:26.469
are you four.

32:28.205 --> 32:32.642
The four of you who changed
my life and ended hers.

32:37.715 --> 32:38.915
Scott,

32:41.191 --> 32:42.625
where's my son?

32:43.687 --> 32:45.088
He's where you put him.

32:47.190 --> 32:49.457
Listen, you tell me what you need.

32:49.560 --> 32:50.627
You just tell me what you-

32:51.202 --> 32:52.662
You just don't offer me money, okay?

32:52.696 --> 32:54.264
I have enough.

32:54.298 --> 32:57.000
What I don't have you
can't give back to me.

32:57.034 --> 32:58.434
Nobody wanted that to happen!

32:58.469 --> 32:59.702
That?

32:59.737 --> 33:01.170
Say her name, Ken.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.567
I-I-I-

33:07.177 --> 33:08.444
I don't re-

33:08.479 --> 33:10.313
I don't remember it.

33:11.181 --> 33:14.017
I don't remember it,
it was a long time ago.

33:14.718 --> 33:16.853
Rebecca!

33:16.887 --> 33:18.321
All right!

33:19.223 --> 33:21.224
After this you'll never forget that.

33:22.660 --> 33:25.662
Please, let-let Josh go. Please.

33:25.696 --> 33:26.863
What?

33:26.897 --> 33:28.064
Let Josh go, please.

33:28.098 --> 33:30.533
Listen, he was just a boy.
He was a boy when it happened.

33:30.567 --> 33:31.601
It's too late now. You had your chance.

33:31.635 --> 33:32.669
No, he was a boy.

33:32.703 --> 33:34.103
He's out there now.

33:36.707 --> 33:37.740
Oh god.

33:37.775 --> 33:39.442
There isn't anything you can do.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.110
I need you to see that.

33:41.145 --> 33:42.940
Please, please don't, okay?

33:42.974 --> 33:43.973
Look at it!

33:44.007 --> 33:45.208
Please don't, okay?

33:45.242 --> 33:48.451
Please don't. Just don't, please.

33:48.485 --> 33:50.620
I'm sorry, okay?

33:50.654 --> 33:51.888
Please.

33:54.391 --> 33:55.591
Please.

33:57.661 --> 33:58.828
I-

33:58.862 --> 34:00.263
You're getting there.

34:00.931 --> 34:02.565
No, listen, no, please.

34:03.934 --> 34:05.768
Come on, come on, don't!

34:06.203 --> 34:07.403
Please!

35:02.659 --> 35:04.260
Hey.

35:04.294 --> 35:05.728
Everyone's ready.

35:12.603 --> 35:13.936
It's all right.

35:13.971 --> 35:14.937
He's rattled.

35:14.972 --> 35:17.373
His plan's falling apart.
We'll find Josh.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.783
We thought Josh McNider and
possibly his father, Ken,

35:26.817 --> 35:28.317
were out on a large body of water

35:28.352 --> 35:29.485
somewhere in the area.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.422
But an infrared equipped
helicopter and search parties

35:32.456 --> 35:34.991
have been all over the lakes.

35:35.025 --> 35:36.459
No sign of them.

35:38.695 --> 35:39.662
Where then?

35:39.696 --> 35:41.864
Well, Robert was found near a clear cut,

35:41.899 --> 35:43.533
Adele in a salvage yard so, uh-

35:43.567 --> 35:45.835
So you're thinking something man-made,

35:45.869 --> 35:47.904
a tailings pond, a reservoir?

35:47.938 --> 35:49.005
Yeah.

35:49.039 --> 35:50.006
It is also possible

35:50.040 --> 35:52.442
that all of these sites
were chosen at random.

35:53.577 --> 35:54.944
There's no pattern.

35:55.803 --> 35:58.306
We'll check with
industry and resource.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.183
See what you can find.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.786
We got the Sheila Gagne search warrant.

36:03.821 --> 36:06.022
The Watershed Forestry connection did it.

36:13.931 --> 36:16.365
We found these in Neil Cuthbert's cabin.

36:18.902 --> 36:20.736
The parka's a youth size medium.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.574
His next victim.

36:27.578 --> 36:28.644
With Neil Cuthbert dead

36:28.679 --> 36:30.680
do we think the killings will stop?

36:33.350 --> 36:34.550
No.

36:35.452 --> 36:37.353
No, they won't stop.

37:03.580 --> 37:05.014
I just got a call.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.818
I have a friend,

37:08.852 --> 37:10.853
a clerk who works for Judge Bradford.

37:13.257 --> 37:14.690
Ah, what is it?

37:15.259 --> 37:17.727
The police have secured
a search warrant on you.

37:17.761 --> 37:19.595
They're probably on their way.

37:23.567 --> 37:25.167
Sheila, what's going on?

37:27.971 --> 37:32.358
The police are looking
for something in my past.

37:34.511 --> 37:36.345
Is there something in your past?

38:06.777 --> 38:09.178
You said you could keep me safe.

38:10.180 --> 38:12.615
You know that truck stop off 17?

38:12.649 --> 38:13.783
The Bay Truck Stop?

38:13.817 --> 38:15.017
Yeah.

38:15.786 --> 38:17.386
Be there in an hour.

38:17.421 --> 38:19.622
The police are following
me. I'll meet you out back.

38:19.656 --> 38:20.856
Okay.

40:20.650 --> 40:22.818
Quillen,
husband of Minister of Northern Affairs,

40:22.853 --> 40:25.554
Sheila Gagne, was abducted and
later found frozen to death

40:25.589 --> 40:26.956
at a remote logging site.

40:50.118 --> 40:51.319
Get in.

41:44.768 --> 41:47.736
All units reporting
structure fire at Mead Lake Quarry.

41:47.771 --> 41:50.339
Individual on scene signalling distress.

42:09.359 --> 42:10.559
Josh!

42:18.041 --> 42:19.641
Come on.

42:19.666 --> 42:20.867
He's alive!
