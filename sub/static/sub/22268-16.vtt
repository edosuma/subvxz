00:01.958 --> 00:03.655
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hello.
You'll recall Jane and Rafael

00:03.699 --> 00:05.092
finally said
the four-letter word. I love you.

00:05.135 --> 00:07.050
And guess who Rafael
didn't love?

00:07.094 --> 00:08.051
This guy.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.835
I thought you focused on

00:09.879 --> 00:11.228
commercial real estate.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.708
Sure. My-my partners do.

00:12.751 --> 00:14.188
So he decided to bet on himself

00:14.231 --> 00:15.711
and find a property to develop.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.104
Unfortunately...

00:17.147 --> 00:20.150
Chase cut me out
of the deal.
What?

00:20.194 --> 00:21.630
And speaking of being
double-crossed,

00:21.673 --> 00:23.153
Petra's lawyer, J.R.,

00:23.197 --> 00:25.068
was working against her
for a while,

00:25.112 --> 00:27.418
but then J.R. came clean
and confessed everything.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.899
The minute I realized you
didn't kill your sister,

00:29.942 --> 00:31.901
I told them I wanted out.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.468
And then this happened.

00:33.511 --> 00:36.079
So, yeah, things are
getting real between Petra

00:36.123 --> 00:37.472
and her lawyer-slash-lover.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.387
But alas, it looks like Petra

00:39.430 --> 00:42.477
may need her lover to be her
slash-lawyer again, after all.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.869
I saw the whole thing.

00:43.913 --> 00:47.177
Petra killed Anezka
in cold blood.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.440
I know! Straight out
of a telenovela,

00:49.484 --> 00:52.052
which reminds me,
Rogelio's American adaptation

00:52.095 --> 00:54.445
ofThe Passions of Santos
was moving forward,

00:54.489 --> 00:57.187
and the fabulous River Fields
agreed to be his costar,

00:57.231 --> 00:58.884
even after this happened.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.060
My eyebrows.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.539
And Xiomara, well,

01:01.583 --> 01:03.150
she faced
her breast cancer diagnosis

01:03.193 --> 01:04.673
with courage and grace.

01:04.716 --> 01:06.501
And she was healing
from her mastectomy.

01:06.544 --> 01:08.503
So all in all,
things are looking up.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.113
So let's dive in.

01:12.159 --> 01:15.292
When Jane Villanueva
was 28 years old,

01:15.336 --> 01:19.122
she decided to move in with
her boyfriend, Rafael Solano.

01:19.166 --> 01:23.779
And, friends, it was romantic
and exciting and...

01:23.822 --> 01:25.172
Expensive. Wow.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.826
A one bedroom
in this school district

01:27.870 --> 01:29.437
doesn't come cheap,
so we're going to have

01:29.480 --> 01:30.307
to make some lifestyle changes.

01:30.351 --> 01:32.048
I'm in.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.745
I can live off of love.

01:33.789 --> 01:36.008
Love and... mm!

01:36.052 --> 01:37.532
This is what we'll need.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.925
First and last month's rent
plus security deposit.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.971
Okay. Wow.
Yeah.

01:42.014 --> 01:45.322
All right. Well,
let's start saving.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.584
Ramen for dinner?

01:46.628 --> 01:48.151
Sounds good to me.

01:48.195 --> 01:51.285
And, friends, save they did.

01:57.552 --> 02:02.383
And little by little,
they were pushing that line.

02:02.426 --> 02:05.168
Who needs CrossFit?

02:07.475 --> 02:10.347
Which brings us here, now.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.088
I worked five extra
shifts this week.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.437
You worked four.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.178
I subtracted money
for our weekly bills

02:15.222 --> 02:16.832
plus Mateo's new
karate session,

02:16.875 --> 02:18.964
and I factored in the prepaid
rent on this apartment

02:19.008 --> 02:22.272
plus a pair of cufflinks I
sold that brought in $500.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.318
I know this is
normally your thing,

02:24.361 --> 02:28.235
but I happen to excel
at budget worksheets.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.497
Really?

02:29.540 --> 02:32.456
Nothing?
I just made a spreadsheet joke.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.197
I thought you'd be
all over that.

02:35.546 --> 02:37.287
Sorry. I'm just
so in the zone.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.463
Well, you are gonna have
to hit pause for a second

02:39.507 --> 02:42.118
to take this in.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.120
We saved enough for
first and last month's rent

02:44.164 --> 02:45.339
on the one bedroom upstairs.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.471
Oh, my God!

02:47.515 --> 02:50.126
Are you... oh.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.696
Yay! We saved enough.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.698
We did, and we have
an extra $173.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.004
Nice!

02:59.048 --> 03:01.746
So, can you take a break
for an open house in an hour

03:01.790 --> 03:04.009
so we can stake
our claim?

03:04.053 --> 03:06.011
Oh. Oh! Stake a claim!

03:06.055 --> 03:07.665
Yes! Yes, yes!

03:07.709 --> 03:10.102
That's actually the expression
I've been looking for.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.756
[chuckles]

03:11.800 --> 03:13.758
Sorry. It's like this faucet
turned on in my brain,

03:13.802 --> 03:15.238
and now I can't turn it off.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.674
I'm happy your writing
is going so well.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.459
[scoffs]
Better than well.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.635
I'm finally on a roll.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.866
Okay. This place was worth
taking a break for.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.782
Right? Feels massive
compared to my studio.

03:37.826 --> 03:41.264
Ah. Couch over here.
Nice play area for Mateo.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.833
And your desk
can go right here,

03:44.876 --> 03:46.400
by the window.

03:46.443 --> 03:48.053
I can already see it.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.273
Mwah.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.057
[chuckles]

03:54.451 --> 03:56.671
Sound it out, buddy.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.988
[chuckles]

04:10.032 --> 04:11.338
Ready for school!

04:11.381 --> 04:14.210
JANE:
Who wants some eggs?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.735
[laughs]

04:17.779 --> 04:19.433
RAFAEL:
So what do you think?

04:19.476 --> 04:21.391
I think we need
a dining room table.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.741
So you want this place?I so want this place.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.482
And a dining room table.

04:25.526 --> 04:28.006
I think we should take the $173
and go to the flea market.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.399
Hmm?
Hmm.

04:29.443 --> 04:32.446
Now, come on. Selfie for my mom.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.491
Mm-hmm.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.235
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. Somebody's feeling better.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.410
How was your run?

04:40.454 --> 04:42.456
Three miles.
No pain at all.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.458
I feel strong.
Ready for chemo.

04:44.501 --> 04:45.633
I've got this.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.156
You've so got this.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.462
And you have the
right mind-set,

04:48.505 --> 04:50.333
the power of
positive thinking.

04:50.377 --> 04:54.250
Exactly. I can see myself
crossing the finish line,

04:54.294 --> 04:57.819
which is why I've decided
to do those cold caps.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.478
Are you sure?

05:04.521 --> 05:07.437
The doctor said the
caps can be painful.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.526
I can handle it.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.486
And I'll feel so much better
if I finish chemo with my hair.

05:12.529 --> 05:15.053
Get on with my life after,
leave cancer behind me.

05:15.097 --> 05:18.840
So, are you up for being
my cold cap coach?

05:18.883 --> 05:20.885
Try saying that
three times fast.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.104
You have to do
some training.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.671
They're apparently tricky
to put on.

05:23.714 --> 05:26.717
Of course. I'll be your
cold cap commando,

05:26.761 --> 05:28.502
your follicle friend,

05:28.545 --> 05:31.156
your hair helper.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.897
[chuckles]

05:32.941 --> 05:35.509
Thanks. Now go get ready
for your meeting.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.946
You can't be late.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.904
So sorry I am late.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.950
[angelic choir singing,
bells chiming]

05:44.126 --> 05:47.347
Wow. Your eyebrows look even
thicker and more magnificent.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.565
How is that possible?

05:48.609 --> 05:50.306
RIVER:
The very best

05:50.350 --> 05:53.570
international team of eyebrow
transplant specialists.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.224
Shall we dive right in?

05:55.267 --> 05:56.747
I called this meeting

05:56.791 --> 05:59.707
to talk about the script,
since I have final approval.

05:59.750 --> 06:03.711
Right now there is way too much
crazy stuff happening.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.887
It's hard to know
what to pay attention to.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.410
What?

06:07.454 --> 06:11.893
You have one
very long eyebrow hair.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.068
Oh.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.200
[blows]

06:15.244 --> 06:16.593
Ah, yes. Right.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.639
Side effect
of a new brow cream.

06:18.682 --> 06:23.208
My point is there's
too much crazy stuff

06:23.252 --> 06:25.123
going on in this show.

06:25.167 --> 06:29.911
So, in the next draft,
we need to really ground it.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.826
I love grounding.
I'm all for grounding.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.741
Let's ground it
into the ground.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.786
But what does that mean?

06:35.830 --> 06:37.832
Like practically, in
terms of the script.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.269
I was thinking, what if the maid

06:40.312 --> 06:42.271
isn't actually
his long-lost mother?

06:42.314 --> 06:43.707
What if she's...

06:44.839 --> 06:45.927
...simply the maid?

06:45.970 --> 06:47.624
Oh, that's nice.
I love that.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.365
Oh, so grounded.
[laughs]

06:49.409 --> 06:50.497
Great.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.847
And in act five,

06:52.890 --> 06:56.459
when Steve hits his head exiting
Air Force One after coming home

06:56.503 --> 06:57.721
from visiting the troops

06:57.765 --> 07:00.071
and gets amnesia,
let's lose it.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.554
The-the airplane ride
or visiting the troops?

07:04.598 --> 07:06.774
The amnesia.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.689
Oh, River, please.

07:08.732 --> 07:12.475
That is a key plot twist,
a classic telenovela trope.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.782
I have to say,
I agree with River.

07:14.825 --> 07:15.696
I do, too.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.175
What a surprise.

07:17.219 --> 07:20.918
Okay. No amnesia.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.834
Perfect.
I've already forgotten it.

07:23.878 --> 07:27.229
Now, let's talk wardrobe.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.579
ELLIE: Are you wearing Mommy's blouse?

07:29.623 --> 07:31.799
I'd call that
a camisole.

07:31.842 --> 07:32.974
Oh, there you are.

07:33.017 --> 07:35.585
Okay, girls, go
put your shoes on.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.720
Quick lawyer moment.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.939
I got an e-mail from the D.A.
this morning.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.768
He wants to meet
about the case on Thursday.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.204
I think this means

07:46.248 --> 07:47.945
they are officially dropping
the charges against you.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.513
[sighs]:
Oh. Finally.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.297
Surprised it took them this long

07:52.341 --> 07:55.300
to realize my mother is the
world's most unreliable witness.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.302
[romantic music playing]

07:57.346 --> 07:59.783
Dinner and drinks downtown
to celebrate tonight?

07:59.827 --> 08:02.046
Mm. It would have to be late.

08:02.090 --> 08:05.093
I'm crazed with work
and the nanny canceled.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.095
Unless you could pick the
girls up after karate.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.749
[romantic music distorts, fades]

08:08.792 --> 08:11.534
Sorry. I-I didn't mean
to overstep.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.624
I just think we should
keep boundaries

08:14.668 --> 08:16.583
in the kid department.
For now.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.106
Absolutely. Understood.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.325
Forget I mentioned karate.MATEO: Hi-ya!

08:20.369 --> 08:22.937
Hey! What did we
say about karate?

08:22.980 --> 08:24.939
Stays in the dojo.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.418
That's right.

08:26.462 --> 08:27.724
You keep your hands to yourself.

08:27.768 --> 08:28.769
Who are you texting?

08:28.812 --> 08:30.335
No one. Sorry.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.728
I was just putting down
some ideas

08:31.772 --> 08:33.077
for a new piece I'm writing.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.122
Your next book?

08:34.165 --> 08:36.385
Ugh. Let's not jinx it.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.605
Everything okay?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.607
Yeah, sorry.
That was, uh, Chase.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.348
As in the guy who cut you
out of the real estate deal

08:43.392 --> 08:44.741
that you put together?

08:44.785 --> 08:46.526
Well, now he wants
to cut me back in.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.745
What? Out of the blue?

08:48.789 --> 08:50.399
Uh, Mateo, slow down!

08:50.442 --> 08:52.401
Yeah, well,
he needs to buy a couple

08:52.444 --> 08:53.794
of the surrounding lots.

08:53.837 --> 08:56.405
And there's a holdout,
guy named Harold.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.538
My dad's friend.
Known him for years.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.801
Chase thinks maybe
I can persuade him to sell,

09:00.844 --> 09:03.325
and if I can,
he would let me back in

09:03.368 --> 09:05.414
because I'd have something
"real" to offer.

09:05.457 --> 09:09.026
Huh. Let's make this
a practice run. Hmm?

09:09.070 --> 09:13.901
This is where we'd discuss
important things,

09:13.944 --> 09:16.338
like whether or not
you should go into business

09:16.381 --> 09:17.861
with a guy you can't trust.

09:17.905 --> 09:20.429
Well, I guess
I know how you feel.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.910
No. Come on.
Let's pro and con it.

09:22.953 --> 09:26.783
Pro: this is a way
into a big opportunity

09:26.827 --> 09:28.829
and with no capital.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.135
I don't have a lot
to offer otherwise.Mm-hmm.

09:31.179 --> 09:32.310
And con...[glass shatters]

09:32.354 --> 09:34.486
Aah!LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.879
That definitely
sounded like a con.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.925
MAN:
You break it,

09:37.968 --> 09:38.795
you buy it.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.841
Of course.
We are so sorry.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.059
How much is it?

09:42.103 --> 09:44.105
4,000.Dollars?!

09:44.148 --> 09:45.628
How would you like to pay?

09:45.672 --> 09:48.762
Ay. Looks like Mateo
broke the clock and the bank.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.986
You will sit there,
Mateo, and not move.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.510
And that money is coming out of
your piggy bank. You understand?

09:58.554 --> 09:59.729
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: That
better be a huge-ass piggy.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.296
So much for the apartment.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.341
Got any more
expensive cufflinks?

10:03.385 --> 10:05.735
I'm totally out of cufflinks.[chuckles]

10:05.779 --> 10:08.346
Hmm, I could always
call that guy.

10:08.390 --> 10:11.567
He's the one that offered me
a job selling time-shares.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.569
Maybe I should
just do it.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.876
No way. That is not your dream.
That is your anti-dream.

10:15.919 --> 10:19.183
We'll figure it out,
somehow.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.838
Come on.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.757
RAFAEL: It's a short-term
solution, but it could work.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.411
If Rafael sublets
his apartment

10:29.454 --> 10:31.413
over spring break
and over the summer,

10:31.456 --> 10:33.937
we can make back
the money we lost

10:33.981 --> 10:37.767
and move into a new place
before the school year.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.422
[chuckles]
Ma, that's too much food.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.386
So, do you guys want
to stay in our guest room?

10:48.430 --> 10:52.826
Thank you, but I think
you need your peace and quiet.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.655
But if Raf moves
back here for a bit,

10:55.698 --> 10:58.396
we can afford
the one bedroom by fall,

10:58.440 --> 11:00.485
and most importantly, our
whole family can stay together.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.274
Oh.

11:06.317 --> 11:09.712
Sorry, River had
a few more script notes.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.671
Turns out she hates
dramatic entrances.

11:11.714 --> 11:14.804
No problem.
You're back.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.501
Let's toast.

11:16.545 --> 11:19.287
To Jane and Raf's
future apartment.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.898
No way, Ma. Tonight,
we are toasting you.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.641
To the strongest,
bravest person I know.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.733
You nervous, my love?

11:30.777 --> 11:32.953
A little. You?

11:32.996 --> 11:34.998
That cold cap training
was intense.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.392
What's a cold cap?

11:37.435 --> 11:38.872
[shivering]

11:38.915 --> 11:40.743
Is it too tight?

11:40.787 --> 11:45.139
No. It's just so cold.

11:45.182 --> 11:48.751
It's like a slushie brain freeze
minus the slushie.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.753
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Sounds like a poop sandwich

11:50.797 --> 11:51.798
minus the bread.

11:51.841 --> 11:54.844
Remember, Xiomara,
think positive.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.629
Right. I've got this.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.762
WOMAN:
Don't overthink it.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.808
Just like
swaddling a baby.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.766
[sighs]
That's very helpful.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.942
I happen to be
an expert swaddler.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.465
Thank you, baby.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.859
You're welcome...
baby.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.209
Another pro tip:

12:12.253 --> 12:14.255
There's a freezer in the back.

12:14.298 --> 12:17.084
Keep your caps there instead
of lugging that cooler around.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.868
Don't worry.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.523
I'll make sure she doesn't
run off with another man.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.308
Thank you.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.664
He'll get the hang of it.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.189
My husband used to
put it on so lopsided,

12:35.232 --> 12:39.541
I looked like the love child
of LL Cool J and Davy Crockett.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.369
[both laugh]

12:44.372 --> 12:46.026
I'm Donna.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.331
Xiomara.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.901
Do you have any friends
with the C-word, Xiomara?

12:51.945 --> 12:54.643
Uh...
Cancer.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.906
Oh. No.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.213
Oh.

12:59.256 --> 13:02.782
Well... you do now.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.787
JANE: Mom said that
her first session was okay.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.137
She made a friend.Of course she did.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.182
Hey, Abuela.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.752
[laughs]

13:16.796 --> 13:18.710
Oh, oh. You're serious?

13:22.366 --> 13:23.803
But you know that we have sex.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.026
You know, I actually love
staying in Mateo's room.

13:35.510 --> 13:38.818
It's only three weeks.
She's doing us a favor.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.385
But what about the summer?
No sex, no...

13:41.429 --> 13:42.952
Going down?

13:42.996 --> 13:45.694
I've never been so happy to have
my head at room temperature.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.174
[chuckles]

13:47.217 --> 13:49.829
I'm sorry.
It's just that you're...

13:49.872 --> 13:51.265
Rogelio de la Vega!
It is I, yes.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.394
Oh. [stutters]

14:41.315 --> 14:43.099
Hmm?

14:55.068 --> 14:56.504
So talk to River.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.985
She is the one
who requested the changes.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.639
So try again. Come on.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.990
Remember the power
of positive thinking?

15:04.033 --> 15:06.209
JANE: Maybe I'm being
overly optimistic,

15:06.253 --> 15:10.083
but I really think
this could be my next book.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.736
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Now who's jinxing it?

15:11.780 --> 15:14.087
That's amazing.
And Chase offered

15:14.130 --> 15:18.091
to pay for a lawyer
to draw up a contract.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.397
Protecting me from him.

15:20.441 --> 15:23.618
Wow. Okay. Now we're talking.Right?

15:23.661 --> 15:24.880
Mmm.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.099
Look at us.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.492
My book, your hotel.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.930
Our dreams are kind of
within reach, huh?

15:30.973 --> 15:33.889
Okay so now we're just
jinxing things left and right?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.978
You know what else is
working out perfectly?

15:36.022 --> 15:38.111
Seriously, stop tempting fate.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.764
My grandma's out.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.466
[giggling]

15:46.597 --> 15:48.512
[screams]

15:48.556 --> 15:51.124
[Jane screaming] I told you. Geez!

15:58.000 --> 16:01.395
The coast is clear.
Abuela took Mateo to church.

16:01.438 --> 16:02.744
[sighs]:
Oh.

16:02.787 --> 16:05.616
So...

16:05.660 --> 16:08.924
What went down after
your grandmother saw my junk?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.796
Oh, nothing too crazy.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.668
I'm an adult!
Adults have sex.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.279
[disgusted grunts]

16:16.323 --> 16:18.629
No more sex in the house
is the bottom line.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.196
We'll have to sneak around
like teenagers.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.416
Not that I ever had sex
when I was a teenager.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.374
We still have all our spots
at the Marbella.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.334
Eyes on the prize.Eyes on the prize.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.900
How'd it go with Chase?

16:28.944 --> 16:31.860
H-He said all the right things.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.209
And it's real, Jane.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.255
I mean, if the city
approves the plans,

16:35.298 --> 16:38.040
then I'll start getting paid,
like, really paid,

16:38.084 --> 16:40.434
when we break ground,
which is in three months.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.523
Really paid as in...?

16:42.566 --> 16:44.612
Maybe even a two bedroom.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.657
Ooh! Look at us.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.920
Moving on up
before we've even moved out.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.227
What's wrong?

16:51.271 --> 16:53.055
The guy is such a douche bag.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.449
I mean, do I really want to go
into business with him?

16:55.492 --> 16:56.711
Long-term?

16:56.754 --> 16:58.104
I don't know.

16:58.147 --> 17:01.455
What do you mean?
You always have an opinion.

17:01.498 --> 17:05.763
It's a hard call, and I haven't
even seen the property.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.939
ROGELIO:
Your opinion is so important.

17:07.983 --> 17:11.204
Which is why I've been saying
yes to all of the changes.

17:11.247 --> 17:14.076
But things have
gone too far.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.078
While you know more
about American television,

17:16.122 --> 17:18.254
I am an expert in telenovelas.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.604
So I must take a stand
for the form.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.606
Is this about the lavender?
Fine.

17:22.650 --> 17:26.436
A purple tie for
the inauguration scene. Happy?

17:26.480 --> 17:30.397
It's not about the lavender.
Or not only about the lavender.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.529
It's about everything.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.271
The maid has to be his mother.

17:36.403 --> 17:37.969
And I have to have amnesia.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.233
And the Oval Office
has to be a heart

17:40.276 --> 17:44.063
because we're co-presidents,
and two ovals form a heart.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.500
It's cheesy!

17:46.543 --> 17:47.805
It's romantic.

17:47.849 --> 17:51.200
And romance is what
novelas are about.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.854
A pornography of emotions.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.163
This can't just be an ordinary
American soap opera.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.078
I am starring in it,

17:59.121 --> 18:02.603
which means that it is
the opposite of ordinary.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.518
Then you leave me
no choice.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.433
I own the rights to The Passions of Santos,

18:06.476 --> 18:08.261
so if you can't
respect my vision,

18:08.304 --> 18:10.567
I will take
the rights elsewhere.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.530
Well played, Rogelio.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.488
I underestimated you.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.360
Thank you. Most people do.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.710
I will call the studio,

18:22.753 --> 18:25.408
and I will tell them
to restore the script

18:25.452 --> 18:29.499
to your original vision.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.110
RAFAEL:
Try to envision it.

18:31.153 --> 18:34.939
And don't look at the graffiti,
or the trash,

18:34.983 --> 18:37.333
or... whatever that is.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.467
[laughs] So where
should I look?

18:42.991 --> 18:45.559
Start here.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.300
We'd go clean
and modern.

18:47.343 --> 18:52.392
250 rooms, all with
a private balcony.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.567
Saltwater pool.

18:53.610 --> 18:56.004
Cabanas. Outdoor bar.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.136
A spa?

18:57.179 --> 18:58.963
With glass walls

18:59.007 --> 19:01.792
on one side looking
out over the water.

19:01.836 --> 19:04.491
[sighs] Can you see it?

19:04.534 --> 19:06.710
I can see it.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.887
You know what else I see?

19:09.931 --> 19:11.846
How excited you are.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.804
You have to do this.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.415
Just protect yourself.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.938
Make sure you have
a good lawyer.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.461
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Speaking of...

19:18.505 --> 19:20.637
The D.A. is not dropping
the charges against you.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.552
What?

19:22.596 --> 19:25.468
It's ridiculous, but apparently
your mother's story checks out.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.470
She told investigators

19:27.514 --> 19:29.820
that Anezka was watching
Game of Thrones,

19:29.864 --> 19:32.475
and even told them where
the episode was paused.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.521
That could be a lucky guess.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.305
Or my sister texted her,

19:36.349 --> 19:38.394
or my mother got her hands
on that police report.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.831
I would've seen her.
J.R., she's lying.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.399
Trust me, no one else was
in the room where it happened.

19:43.443 --> 19:44.966
The room where it happened?

19:45.009 --> 19:47.751
The room where
it happened, right.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.101
But your mother said
she was in the bathroom.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.190
Well, she's lying.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.453
And we will prove that.

19:53.496 --> 19:57.196
And then I will get this case
dismissed with prejudice.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.724
I'm good at my job.
I will catch her in a lie.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.682
XIOMARA:
You're gonna get us arrested.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.423
[laughs]Put those things away!

20:07.467 --> 20:08.555
Oh, please.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.557
It's part of the sisterhood.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.341
Come on. Just feel 'em.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.481
Whoa.

20:21.524 --> 20:24.962
Just the right balance
of perky and supple.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.574
[smacks lips]
I'll take one of those![both laughing]

20:27.617 --> 20:30.229
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Now that's what I call
ordering off the menu.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.710
Why is it so hot?Ah, it's the radiation.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.583
We call it "the hot toddy."

20:36.626 --> 20:38.454
[both laughing]

20:38.498 --> 20:40.717
Ah. I never thought

20:40.761 --> 20:43.459
someone would make me laugh
this much about cancer.

20:43.503 --> 20:46.506
Well, you know, it helps
that I'm high as a kite.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.552
[laughing quietly]Really? Weed?

20:49.596 --> 20:52.120
Takes the edge off the
cold caps, trust me.

20:52.163 --> 20:56.385
And you got to do what
you can to feel good.

20:56.429 --> 20:59.475
Because it does get harder.

20:59.519 --> 21:02.522
Yeah. I'm just trying
to stay positive.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.654
I want to cross
that finish line.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.830
I know.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.571
JANE:
I so know.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.660
The hotel's
gonna be great.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.575
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And
speaking of crossing a line...

21:13.663 --> 21:16.057
Hey! Mateo!

21:16.100 --> 21:18.668
Don't you ever lay a hand
on my son again!

21:23.499 --> 21:27.547
I can't believe you would
ever hit Mateo.

21:27.590 --> 21:28.983
I don't care what he was doing!

21:29.026 --> 21:31.072
Okay, okay,
you need to calm down

21:31.115 --> 21:32.334
and watch your tone.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.684
And we talked about this.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.860
Hold on, wait. This
has happened before?

21:36.904 --> 21:38.340
Once. I told her not to do it.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.908
Then you should have told me.
We are not a hitting family.

21:40.951 --> 21:43.084
We also do not yell
at my abuela.

21:43.127 --> 21:45.434
This is her house, so you need
to show her some respect.

21:45.478 --> 21:48.437
[sighs]

21:48.481 --> 21:50.352
I'm sorry.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.746
I didn't mean
to raise my voice at you.

21:52.789 --> 21:55.618
Just promise me
that will never happen again.

21:58.447 --> 21:59.796
Excuse me?Abuela!

22:02.799 --> 22:05.019
You cannot spank my son.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.368
Understand?

22:06.412 --> 22:10.416
My house, my rules.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.113
Understand?

22:12.156 --> 22:14.289
Then I'm not
staying here anymore.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.812
JANE:
And then Abuela said

22:15.856 --> 22:17.248
good riddance,
and he left,

22:17.292 --> 22:18.989
and the whole thing
is just such a mess, Mom.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.470
Aw, hon. They probably just
need time to cool off.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.037
I hope so.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.256
Man, I'm gonna need to cool off
if I keep walking with you.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.258
Chemo hasn't slowed
you down at all.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.696
I know, right?
I really do feel good.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.263
Just give everyone time.
It will get better.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.138
It's gotten so much worse.

22:37.181 --> 22:38.705
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I'll say.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.837
Abuela claims that
she's forgiven Raf,

22:40.881 --> 22:42.448
but the way that
she glares at him,

22:42.491 --> 22:44.624
ugh, I wouldn't want to come
over to the house either.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.365
So he doesn't.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.410
Are you sure
you're okay?

22:48.454 --> 22:50.978
I can get to the bench.
Keep talking.

22:52.501 --> 22:55.461
Well, between
his real estate project,

22:55.504 --> 22:58.028
our different shifts at work,
and my writing schedule,

22:58.072 --> 22:59.508
we're like ships in the night.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.118
He's only a month away
from breaking ground

23:01.162 --> 23:02.598
on the hotel
though, right?

23:02.642 --> 23:05.558
Yeah, which means we're
a month away from a payday.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.429
[chuckles][groans softly]

23:07.473 --> 23:09.692
Are you sure
we shouldn't stop?

23:09.736 --> 23:11.564
I can get to the bench.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.566
That's the finish line.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.045
Ugh, poor Xo.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.612
It's so hard to
see her like this.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.441
You and Raf need to carve out
some alone time.

23:19.485 --> 23:22.401
Oh, we have a hot date planned,
at the Marbella storage closet.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.576
Capped off with
fried fish sticks,

23:23.619 --> 23:25.012
free from
the kids' buffet.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.188
Okay, we're at the bench. Sit.

23:27.231 --> 23:29.799
You know what,
while Xo catches her breath,

23:29.843 --> 23:32.585
why don't I catch you up
on Jane and Raf's finances?

23:32.628 --> 23:34.717
Okay, in the last nine weeks,

23:34.761 --> 23:37.459
Jane and Rafael have saved
enough money to...

23:37.503 --> 23:39.243
pay off the freaking clock.

23:39.287 --> 23:41.681
So, in other words, they're...

23:41.724 --> 23:42.986
back to square one.

23:43.030 --> 23:44.597
I'm ready.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.860
[groans softly]

23:46.903 --> 23:48.688
Talk to me
about your writing.

23:48.731 --> 23:51.691
It's going well.
I can't wait for you to read it.

23:51.734 --> 23:52.996
Oh, me, too.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.998
As soon as I don't have
chemo brain.

23:55.042 --> 23:57.566
The only thing worse
than chemo brain?

23:57.610 --> 24:00.090
Chemo brain freeze.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.963
I wish there was more
that I could do for you.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.531
Distract me. Keep talking.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.533
So, the sets are done?

24:07.576 --> 24:09.622
Yes. Uh, I am meeting
the production designer

24:09.665 --> 24:12.494
later today to see them.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.496
How have you been feeling
this week, Xiomara?

24:14.540 --> 24:18.674
Well, uh... tired, nauseous.

24:18.718 --> 24:21.372
Uh, but I-I know it'll pass.

24:21.416 --> 24:22.678
You have a great attitude.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.593
Donna's late today.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.552
She's gonna love
the fake eyelashes I bought her.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.118
Yeah.
[chuckles]

24:29.468 --> 24:30.469
What?

24:30.512 --> 24:33.646
Donna had
an unexpected recurrence

24:33.689 --> 24:35.386
with complications.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.519
She...

24:37.563 --> 24:39.652
passed away three days ago.

24:39.695 --> 24:43.525
What? I don't understand.

24:43.569 --> 24:44.744
It happened suddenly.

24:44.787 --> 24:47.137
Things progressed quickly.

24:47.181 --> 24:49.183
I am so sorry.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.577
She wanted me

24:51.620 --> 24:54.144
to give you
her pot brownies.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.554
Xiomara...

25:12.598 --> 25:15.426
No. I'll be okay.

25:15.470 --> 25:16.645
[sniffles]

25:16.689 --> 25:18.995
It's just the cold cap.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.607
PETRA:
I just feel so helpless.

25:21.650 --> 25:24.653
The thought of you meeting
my mother without me?

25:24.697 --> 25:26.481
Baby, come on.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.570
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh. We're up to "baby" now.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.616
You've already prepared me
for what I can expect.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.661
The hook, the eye.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.533
The absolute hatred for me.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.317
Look, she may be
a good liar,

25:36.360 --> 25:39.059
but I'm a better lawyer.
I'll catch her.

25:39.102 --> 25:41.235
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here... now.

25:41.278 --> 25:45.239
And why were you in the
bathroom for 22 minutes?

25:45.282 --> 25:47.633
IBS. You know
what that is?

25:47.676 --> 25:50.766
I do.
Explosive diarrhea.

25:53.900 --> 25:57.251
Okay, so you went
to the bathroom.
Mm-hmm.

25:57.294 --> 25:59.601
And then?I was about to leave,

25:59.645 --> 26:02.735
but I heard all this yelling,
so I pushed open the door.

26:02.778 --> 26:05.781
Uh, sorry.
I missed that last point.

26:05.825 --> 26:07.609
I pushed open the door,

26:07.653 --> 26:10.569
and I saw Petra
standing by front door.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.614
And then Anezka,
she say something,

26:12.658 --> 26:15.399
but I could not hear what it was
because the toilet was running.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.053
But Petra, she turned,

26:17.097 --> 26:19.186
and she charged her sister,

26:19.229 --> 26:22.058
and she shoved Anezka
over the balcony!

26:22.102 --> 26:23.494
Voomp!

26:23.538 --> 26:24.626
Then Petra's heel broke.

26:24.670 --> 26:27.063
Wait. Petra's heel broke?

26:27.107 --> 26:29.631
That wasn't in your original
statement to the police.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.894
I must have forgot.

26:32.765 --> 26:35.289
Are we done here?
I'm getting hungry.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.555
[phone chimes]

26:50.217 --> 26:51.827
[phone chimes]

26:58.921 --> 27:01.402
WOMAN: You're gonna love
what we've built here,

27:01.445 --> 27:03.012
Mr. De La Vega.

27:03.056 --> 27:06.189
And voila!

27:07.538 --> 27:08.714
But...

27:08.757 --> 27:11.064
this is just a regular
oval Oval Office.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.413
River approved it.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.329
It looks like
a double-breasted

27:15.372 --> 27:17.200
poop emoji!

27:17.244 --> 27:18.898
River approved it.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.857
Oh, my God, they
cut the amnesia!

27:21.901 --> 27:24.207
I'm guessing River approved it?

27:26.732 --> 27:28.908
What the hell are you doing?!

27:28.951 --> 27:31.214
I need to apply
this extremely rare cream

27:31.258 --> 27:33.652
to my eyebrows,
or the transplant won't take.

27:33.695 --> 27:34.696
I don't believe you.Oh, it's true.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.742
I had it shipped
directly from Paris.

27:36.785 --> 27:39.222
I'm not talking
about your overrated bushes,

27:39.266 --> 27:40.833
you diabolical diva!

27:40.876 --> 27:43.139
I'm talking about
all of the changes

27:43.183 --> 27:46.708
we agreed to-- the sets,
the costumes, the script!

27:46.752 --> 27:49.319
The executives and I decided
to go in a different direction.

27:49.363 --> 27:52.148
You can't.
Iown the rights.

27:52.192 --> 27:56.152
To the telenovela,
but these past two months,

27:56.196 --> 27:59.155
I have secured
the underlying rights...

27:59.199 --> 28:02.028
to the short story
the telenovela was based on,

28:02.071 --> 28:06.859
which means that I can do
this show any way I want.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.730
[gasps]

28:08.774 --> 28:10.079
Oh, please.
Don't be so dramatic.

28:10.123 --> 28:13.909
If you knew anything
about telenovelas,

28:13.953 --> 28:18.261
you'd know that everything
is supposed to be dramatic!

28:19.698 --> 28:21.743
[door slams]

28:26.792 --> 28:30.578
That hateful hen set me up.
You know what we have to do?

28:30.621 --> 28:33.102
Pack up your dressing room?Get revenge.

28:33.146 --> 28:36.018
Have you ever
killed anyone, Rudy?

28:36.062 --> 28:38.238
Kidding.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.196
But you haven't, though, right?[ringtone playing]

28:40.240 --> 28:43.243
I need to take this. Go.

28:58.388 --> 29:00.695
Alba called.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.784
You weren't home,
so she was worried.

29:02.828 --> 29:05.787
We came here every week.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.704
And now...

29:09.748 --> 29:14.100
[sighs]

29:14.143 --> 29:16.145
I'm sorry.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.930
I'm trying to be
positive for you.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.106
For me?

29:20.149 --> 29:21.237
I don't need that.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.544
I just mean...

29:23.587 --> 29:27.766
it makes you feel better,
which makes me feel better,

29:27.809 --> 29:31.247
because I hate
when you so worry so much.

29:31.291 --> 29:35.121
But with Donna...

29:35.164 --> 29:37.906
I didn't have to do anything
or be anything.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.125
She just got it.

29:39.168 --> 29:41.780
That makes sense.

29:41.823 --> 29:45.784
But no, you don't have
to worry about me.

29:45.827 --> 29:49.178
I need you here.

29:49.222 --> 29:51.877
Positive, negative.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.966
Whatever you're feeling.

29:54.009 --> 29:56.403
But what if that's not possible?

29:57.534 --> 30:00.363
I'm sorry.

30:00.407 --> 30:04.367
[voice breaking]: I know
that's an awful thing to say,

30:04.411 --> 30:09.416
but Donna was here,
and now she's gone, and...

30:09.459 --> 30:11.505
that could be me.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.159
That's not going to happen.

30:13.202 --> 30:16.162
But it could.
It could happen.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.555
I think
it's just hitting me

30:18.599 --> 30:21.471
that... there is no finish line.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.474
I thought once chemo was over,

30:24.518 --> 30:27.434
I'd put it in the rearview
mirror and leave it behind,

30:27.477 --> 30:29.044
but it doesn't work like that.

30:29.088 --> 30:31.177
Donna was fine.

30:31.220 --> 30:35.311
For five years, she was fine,
and now she's not here anymore,

30:35.355 --> 30:39.838
and that just sucks.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.796
It does.

30:41.840 --> 30:46.757
So, I am gonna quit
those stupid cold caps.

30:46.801 --> 30:50.065
If I lose my hair, so what?

30:50.109 --> 30:54.287
They hurt too damn much,
and every day is hard enough.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.897
[sighs]

30:55.941 --> 30:58.160
Thank God.

30:58.204 --> 31:02.295
It was torture
just watching you.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.565
[dish clinks in distance]

31:20.095 --> 31:22.706
Abuela, why can't you let it go?

31:23.969 --> 31:26.319
This whole thing
with Rafael.

31:26.362 --> 31:27.973
You're not. You're
still being cold,

31:28.016 --> 31:29.670
so he doesn't want
to come over,

31:29.713 --> 31:31.280
which means I hardly
get to see him.

31:31.324 --> 31:34.762
I mean, we're falling asleep
FaceTiming each other.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.633
No. Why are you still so mad?

31:48.950 --> 31:50.212
Too old?

31:50.256 --> 31:52.475
You're a long way
away from that.

31:52.519 --> 31:54.260
No.

32:02.746 --> 32:03.617
Abuela.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.711
I know, Abuela. Shh, shh, shh.

32:10.754 --> 32:13.018
It's okay.

32:15.542 --> 32:16.978
[sighs]

32:17.022 --> 32:20.416
Yeah, I think we'll be okay.
Caught your mother in a lie.

32:20.460 --> 32:23.463
She said she pushed
the bathroom door open.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.117
The door pulls in.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.989
It's enough to discredit
someone like her, someone...

32:28.033 --> 32:29.860
who's lied before.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.688
Well, that's great news.

32:33.342 --> 32:35.475
So what's wrong?

32:37.520 --> 32:40.132
She said something else.

32:40.175 --> 32:43.962
Something I can't
stop thinking about.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.920
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did she give you details

32:45.964 --> 32:47.966
about her bowel movements?
Look, it's a whole thing.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.316
About what happened that night.
In the room.

32:50.359 --> 32:51.708
She said Anezka

32:51.752 --> 32:53.580
said something,

32:53.623 --> 32:56.931
and then you charged at her
and your heel broke.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.281
What? That's ridiculous.

32:59.325 --> 33:00.979
