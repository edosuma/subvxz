<i> - The Eagle has landed, baby.
- Please, keep that fool off the main frequency.</i>

02:20.691 --> 02:23.350
<i> Are you getting a reading
there, Sanders?</i>

02:23.351 --> 02:27.556
Mission control, I can confirm
vast quantities of Helium-3.

02:27.557 --> 02:30.857
<i> - The reading are stronger this way.
- What? You breaking up...</i>

02:31.058 --> 02:33.861

<i>Adjust communicate...
frequency...</i>

02:37.063 --> 02:39.919
No fucking way!

02:40.520 --> 02:43.856
Hey, Sand, what you doin'
with that thing hopping around over there?

02:43.860 --> 02:46.591
I thought you were supposed to take
some photos of me?

03:04.817 --> 03:07.705
- Washington, have you got a visual on...
- What was that, Houston?

03:07.706 --> 03:11.159
- Hey, Washington, it's Helium-3.
- What?

03:11.160 --> 03:13.384
It's a Helium-3 mine.
Get over here!

03:13.390 --> 03:16.022
Hey, there's something over here
you need to see!

03:17.479 --> 03:21.079
No! Sanders!
Sanders! San...ah!

03:24.200 --> 03:25.565
Oh, God!

03:31.807 --> 03:37.461
<i> Houston, Houston!Son-of-a-bitch.
I need to get out of here.</i>

03:51.890 --> 03:56.300
I must be trippin'.

Subtitle upgrade by Szaki
based on zathras69's sub.

04:38.369 --> 04:42.652
Sieg Heil, Moon youth führer,
Renate Richter.

04:42.653 --> 04:44.000
Heil Hitler.

04:44.781 --> 04:48.489
Boys and girls,
please sit down.

04:49.549 --> 04:53.333
Dieter, don't you know
where to put your behind?

04:53.334 --> 04:57.209
Miss. Richter, since Mondführer's
65th birthday

04:57.210 --> 05:00.558
te appropriate salute has been
"Heil Kortzfleisch!"

05:01.782 --> 05:05.101
You're such an exemplary boy.

05:05.102 --> 05:11.043
Today we'll start with the most
unpatriotic language.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.387
It's the language
we unfortunately need to know

05:14.388 --> 05:18.274
when we return to those
who need our help.

05:18.887 --> 05:20.933
In english now.

05:21.634 --> 05:25.141
Where are we from?

05:25.842 --> 05:28.020
- Siegfried!
- The Earth.

05:28.121 --> 05:30.761
And, when did we leave?

05:30.762 --> 05:33.448
- Brunhilda?
- 1945.

05:33.450 --> 05:38.240
- And where did we go?
- The dark side of the moon.

05:38.261 --> 05:39.861
Brilliant!

06:02.876 --> 06:06.039
Attention!
The National Anthem.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.600
- Heil Hitler!
- Hitler...

06:52.859 --> 06:56.168
- What's that, Mr. Adler?
- A spy from the earth.

06:56.269 --> 06:58.290
I captured him myself.

06:58.300 --> 07:01.272
He seems to he
the leader of the shock troops.

07:19.967 --> 07:24.162
Mr. Adler, is this a joke?

07:24.263 --> 07:27.050
I'll be damned!

07:30.701 --> 07:32.360
The White House
Washington D. C.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.654
Don't try to play dumb with me.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.925
It was your bad idea to send
those idiots to the moon?

07:37.021 --> 07:40.917
- Talk about disaster. - I'm not
to be contrarian madam President

07:40.952 --> 07:43.072
but I'm pretty sure
it was your idea.

07:43.100 --> 07:47.849
It was my great idea if have they succeeded.
Now it's your stupid idea, got it?

07:47.850 --> 07:51.866
I didn't hire you for stupid ideas.
I hired you because of your Midas touch.

07:51.867 --> 07:55.928
Now my approval ratings are in the toilet
and the election is just weeks...

07:56.550 --> 07:58.990
You dropped the ball, Vivian!
You!

07:58.991 --> 08:02.543
Now, I need a miracle.
Get me a miracle!

08:08.589 --> 08:12.050
Actually, how was sending those
two astronauts to the Moon,

08:12.100 --> 08:14.895
supposed to getting me re-elected?
Exactly?

08:15.205 --> 08:17.300
We haven't been to the Moon
for 50 years.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.297
One of them was black.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.850
Thought it would look good.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.755
Look good how?

08:23.559 --> 08:25.566
Like I said, one of them was black.

08:25.601 --> 08:31.085
Just think of the opportunity we wasted years 
ago with that errand boy, Powell, Alan Powell?

08:31.228 --> 08:33.337
- Colin Powell.
- That was close.

08:34.155 --> 08:38.034
- And where're you going?
- The UN, to do my job.

08:49.015 --> 08:51.824
"The Great Dictator"
by Charlie Chaplin.

08:51.920 --> 08:55.242
It's one of the world
most famous short films.

08:55.243 --> 09:00.783
Which illustrates in just 10 minutes,
his wish that one day, the entire world

09:00.784 --> 09:04.956
that will be held in the great Führer's
wise and gentle hands.

09:05.199 --> 09:07.662
- Any questions?
- I have a question.

09:07.863 --> 09:09.500
My sweetheart.

09:10.807 --> 09:12.500
Mr. Adler.

09:13.499 --> 09:18.244
In my classroom we are here to strictly
formal manner in addressing one another.

09:18.534 --> 09:22.393
To what do we owe the honor
of this visit?

09:22.394 --> 09:25.033
Mr. Nachrichten übermittlungs-
Oberführer Adler?

09:25.390 --> 09:29.684
We captured an earthling.
Your expertise is required.

09:39.095 --> 09:42.536
- What's for lunch today?
- Sauerkraut.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.521
Again! Please say
that's not true!

09:45.722 --> 09:49.021
Does the Fuhrer eat Sauerkraut
3 times a week as well?

09:49.654 --> 09:53.488
No, no no!
I love me some sauerkraut.

09:53.489 --> 09:57.638
And Volkswagen.
Huh...Fahrvergnügen.

09:58.580 --> 10:00.664
Hey! German words, right?

10:00.761 --> 10:05.394
You know, it's as if, where I come from
we speak German too. You know what I'm sayin'?

10:08.511 --> 10:11.747
Damn! You gonna be sorry
you did that white boy.

10:16.607 --> 10:20.073
Capture him! No!
Capture him!

10:20.308 --> 10:22.034
Do not shoot!

10:56.651 --> 11:01.650
The fugitive is a male negro,
unarmed, but possibly angry.

11:01.657 --> 11:04.202
How does he look like?

11:04.203 --> 11:08.410
Where does he come from?
What is he wearing?

11:10.465 --> 11:12.358
How do I look?

11:13.874 --> 11:16.267
Like they say in English...

11:17.268 --> 11:18.940
you are a knock-out.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.224
How do I get out of here?

11:28.190 --> 11:30.391
Thanks lady.
Have a nice day.

11:31.279 --> 11:34.500
No, Mr. Subhuman.
That is the air lock...

11:34.964 --> 11:36.329
No!

11:37.130 --> 11:38.330
No!

12:23.315 --> 12:25.827
You might wanna...
cover up a bit.

12:27.687 --> 12:29.339
All good?

12:32.426 --> 12:35.169
Klaus! Don't shoot.
We need him for tests...

12:35.170 --> 12:39.270
No, no, no! I would not do if I was you.
Listen to me. Listen to me!

12:39.288 --> 12:42.170
I know a lot of important people.
They're very important people.

12:42.171 --> 12:44.750
I even know the President
of the United States of America.

12:44.751 --> 12:48.264
Now...if you kill me, then that's just a
really fucked-up situation.

12:51.469 --> 12:55.233
You know the president of the
United States of the Americas?

12:59.896 --> 13:03.379
- Take him to Dr. Richter's laboratory!
- By your command!

13:05.119 --> 13:08.337
Thanks, homie.
I talk to you later baby.

13:21.463 --> 13:23.882
Question, what is this apparatus?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.452
Look man, how would I know?
I'm just model.

13:26.463 --> 13:30.402
- A model what? Citizen?
- No man, a model model.

13:30.493 --> 13:33.198
Damn, what's wrong with you two?
Blind or something?

13:33.309 --> 13:36.227
-Shit, I'm pretty.
-Are you part of the shock troops

13:36.337 --> 13:41.090
- before the invasion?
- Invasion? Man, you all must be tripping?

13:41.425 --> 13:43.819
What is your mission?

13:44.420 --> 13:48.050
Look dude, I just follow the paycheck,
you know what I'm saying?

13:48.330 --> 13:52.555
-What is this device?
-That's my kick-ass cellphone

13:52.756 --> 13:55.158
-and a computer.
-What?

13:57.541 --> 14:00.428
That's not a computer.

14:03.665 --> 14:06.177
This is a computer.

14:09.174 --> 14:13.344
No man. That's ancient
history, homie.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.740
Dumb negro.

14:16.050 --> 14:19.036
- He talks nonsense.
- It might be a dialect.

14:19.328 --> 14:21.606
- Probable reason is the skin color.
- Right.

14:21.907 --> 14:26.596
His brain structure is
different from us Aryans.

14:28.045 --> 14:31.863
Let's open up his skull
and measure the brain.

14:32.064 --> 14:34.547
No, I need to know why he's here.

14:36.065 --> 14:38.914
You have 24 hours, Doctor.

14:39.606 --> 14:43.683
Otherwise I have to rely on
an ancient infallible technique.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.819
Pain.

14:48.758 --> 14:50.500
UNITED WORLD CONFEDERACY,
NEW YORK

14:50.550 --> 14:52.399
I am telling you once again.

14:52.714 --> 14:57.761
One moment we received conformation
that the ship has landed successfully on the moon.

14:57.857 --> 15:00.801
The next, all communications stopped.

15:00.835 --> 15:04.627
- As though it had simply vanished.
- Or you're hiding something from us?

15:04.728 --> 15:08.345
Yeah, we are hiding something
on the dark side of the moon.

15:09.885 --> 15:15.468
I still find it very difficult to believe
that the entire purpose of the mission

15:15.500 --> 15:19.352
was to promote your president's
re-election.

15:19.353 --> 15:22.008
Well believe what you like, we had
mere senators spend

15:22.043 --> 15:26.352
hundred-of-million on campaigns
to get elected to dog-shit post.

15:26.353 --> 15:30.102
But Mr. Secretary, the expenses
involve this time only makes sense

15:30.199 --> 15:31.948
if there was a military purpose.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.338
Okay, let's get this clear.

15:34.639 --> 15:38.787
The United State has no
military activity on the Moon.

15:38.890 --> 15:41.506
What about natural resources activity?

15:41.507 --> 15:44.434
We know how the U.S. sometimes
mixes the two up.

15:45.021 --> 15:48.430
Is there any chance that you are
looking for Helium-3 up there?

15:48.446 --> 15:52.660
Helium-3? You just made that up,
didn't you?

15:54.122 --> 15:56.123
That's so silly.

15:58.359 --> 16:01.823
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HQ,
NY

16:14.769 --> 16:17.432
I assume these are
just preliminary idea?

16:17.433 --> 16:21.325
Sir, we have a very small
delivery window.

16:21.526 --> 16:23.255
- Sir?
- Yes, sir.

16:24.407 --> 16:27.401
Ma'am, and this is all.

16:36.728 --> 16:41.135
Anyone who is not the
head of the department, should leave.

16:49.874 --> 16:52.279
You idiots!

16:52.280 --> 16:56.736
You morons!
That's an insult to morons.

16:57.514 --> 17:00.560
What is this shit?

17:00.878 --> 17:07.781
I have a meeting with the President
of the United fucking States of the America

17:07.781 --> 17:09.625
tomorrow fucking morning!

17:10.153 --> 17:13.061
Not the President
of fucking Zambia!

17:13.063 --> 17:16.143
Not the President of
the fucking Janitor's Union!

17:16.144 --> 17:20.743
But with the president of the fucking country which
you just happen to be living in at the fucking moment!

17:20.744 --> 17:25.204
You pieces of hellacious shit!

17:29.535 --> 17:32.280
What am I supposed to tell her?

17:34.239 --> 17:37.998
That my employees
are not intelligent enough,

17:38.957 --> 17:41.622
to be fucking morons?

18:08.009 --> 18:11.297
- Mr. Adler.
- Call me Klaus.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.431
- May I?
- Of course.

18:20.070 --> 18:25.102
I've come to discuss
our legal union.

18:28.091 --> 18:31.748
- Is that a marriage proposal?
- There's no need for marriage.

18:32.043 --> 18:35.896
I received the confirmation of
the Department of Racial Purity.

18:39.187 --> 18:41.894
Our genetic match is 97%.

18:41.895 --> 18:44.911
How romantic.

18:45.469 --> 18:49.385
Science demands us
to unite physically.

18:49.386 --> 18:54.783
It's our destiny to produce
perfect offspring for the people.

18:56.634 --> 18:59.880
What about my scientific research?

19:03.227 --> 19:06.828
One day, Renate...

19:08.623 --> 19:11.819
all this will be ours.

19:13.385 --> 19:17.480
But first, I must conquer
the Earth.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.337
Wolfgang, that old fart,
stands in my way.

19:21.064 --> 19:23.750
In the way of final victory.

19:24.518 --> 19:28.141
The two of us will take on
an enormous responsibility.

19:28.845 --> 19:32.715
Your place is, Renate,
by my side.

19:46.167 --> 19:50.351
Gentlemen!
Battleship Götterdämmerung.

19:50.380 --> 19:55.600
Our miracle weapon that has been
under development for 40 years.

19:55.700 --> 20:00.124
The dream of our beloved Führer.

20:00.325 --> 20:04.813
But unfortunately only a dream,
until now.

20:05.014 --> 20:08.900
- Please Doctor.
- Watch this!

20:11.890 --> 20:14.508
This tiny device

20:14.509 --> 20:19.654
has over a 1000 times more computing
power than our biggest computers together.

20:19.855 --> 20:23.616
I engineered this cable

20:24.009 --> 20:28.399
to connect this machine
with our main computer.

20:28.787 --> 20:34.068
I call this Universal
Systematic Binding USB for short.

20:36.566 --> 20:38.933
This will lift it into the air.

20:38.968 --> 20:43.660
Finally, the Götterdämmerung
will fly!

20:45.259 --> 20:47.637
- Yes.
- Yes.

21:35.473 --> 21:40.189
You saw it!
You saw it with your own eyes!

21:40.843 --> 21:45.497
Mein Führer, please
let me return to the Earth.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.317
Let me get more of these devices.

21:48.418 --> 21:51.577
No one has ever returned.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.722
I will return.

21:53.723 --> 21:55.686
We don't have a choice

21:55.898 --> 21:58.586
if we want to prevent
an invasion from the Earth.

22:03.501 --> 22:06.598
<i>Are you willing to work
with the Führer...</i>

22:06.599 --> 22:10.842
<i>in the name of the fatherland,
stand behind the Wehrmacht.</i>

22:10.843 --> 22:14.281
<i>This decision does not
resolve all of us ...</i>

22:19.003 --> 22:22.962
Thank you.
I thought my ears were gonna bleed.

22:23.163 --> 22:24.722
You're welcome.

22:37.573 --> 22:40.967
May I ask what's your name is?

22:41.610 --> 22:43.412
Washington,
James Washington.

22:43.613 --> 22:46.108
- What's yours?
- Renate Richter.

22:46.675 --> 22:49.770
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Washington.

22:50.167 --> 22:51.846
James Washington.

22:53.468 --> 22:55.768
What's wrong with your skin?

22:56.669 --> 23:00.281
Come on now, please. You have
never met a brother before, right?

23:02.087 --> 23:05.572
- No, I'm an only child.
- No, no, I didn't mean like that.

23:05.583 --> 23:07.781
I meant a black man.

23:07.982 --> 23:11.489
No, and this continues to confuse me

23:11.586 --> 23:15.034
because you are much blacker
when I first encountered you.

23:15.524 --> 23:19.273
Okay girl look, either I'm black
or you're blind.

23:19.274 --> 23:22.260
Look, what is going
to happen to me?

23:22.270 --> 23:25.300
I mean, what's with this, this guy
that keeps sticking needles in me?

23:25.519 --> 23:28.542
- What about that other angry dude?
- My father's sticking needles into you?

23:28.652 --> 23:31.442
That's freaking scientist guy?
That's your dad?

23:32.192 --> 23:34.390
And what about, you know....?

23:35.737 --> 23:38.439
Mr. Nachrichtenübermittlungs
-Oberführer Adler?

23:38.440 --> 23:40.636
-I'm sorry, what?
- Klaus Adler.

23:41.304 --> 23:44.615
He's going to be
the next fuhrer.

23:46.398 --> 23:48.063
And my husband.

23:49.764 --> 23:52.887
What? You lose a bet or
something? I mean....

23:54.826 --> 23:56.689
you are...lucky you.

23:57.759 --> 24:00.690
Actually, lucky him.

24:05.257 --> 24:09.256
- I shouldn't even be here.
- You cannot leave me tied up like this.

24:11.487 --> 24:13.407
- Please do me a favor.
- What?

24:13.408 --> 24:15.928
- Play a Nazi
- And what, if I don't?

24:17.806 --> 24:20.674
- They will eliminate you.
- Oh great!

24:23.367 --> 24:26.746
Is there a different radio station?

24:27.108 --> 24:29.673
<i>With the upcoming war ...</i>

24:29.769 --> 24:32.752
- He's back.
- Looks good.

24:35.403 --> 24:39.087
This will solve our
little problem.

24:39.088 --> 24:42.715
Okay, mini Mengele.
Hey man, I don't like the look of this.

24:42.716 --> 24:44.616
I am coming.

24:47.742 --> 24:50.561
Looks very good.

24:51.479 --> 24:54.449
And now we just...

25:04.076 --> 25:08.425
- Why do not you take me with you?
- Don't worry, darling.

25:08.426 --> 25:11.098
After I complete my mission,
I come back to you.

25:11.133 --> 25:14.635
That's not what I mean.
I'm an Earthologist!

25:14.636 --> 25:18.816
I know everything about it.
You need me.

25:18.951 --> 25:23.000
You sweet little thing, where do you
get all those crazy ideas?

25:23.630 --> 25:26.361
Books, mostly...

25:26.622 --> 25:29.000
and some films.

25:40.610 --> 25:43.068
I shall return triumphant!

26:02.300 --> 26:05.233
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Kortzfleisch!

26:05.234 --> 26:08.851
- Get it through your skull.
- Of course, mein Führer.

26:09.255 --> 26:13.206
We have one more
ace up our sleeve.

26:16.707 --> 26:19.024
Show him what we have.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.669
Voila, gentlemen!

26:29.670 --> 26:33.004
- Doctor.
- Watch closely.

26:36.102 --> 26:37.828
Heil!

26:48.640 --> 26:50.057
Stand up, you fool.

26:54.361 --> 26:56.955
Sieg Heil!

27:06.089 --> 27:09.974
With the prisoner now being
one of us, we will go down to Earth.

27:10.018 --> 27:14.219
He will help us to find more
telephone computers. We return.

27:14.220 --> 27:17.374
And then get the
Götterdämmerung flying.

27:17.375 --> 27:20.900
Oberführer Adler,
I hope you've discussed

27:22.400 --> 27:24.189
my return to the Earth.

27:24.807 --> 27:27.042
Something along those lines.

27:27.143 --> 27:31.000
The Reich trusts you.

27:33.688 --> 27:37.359
- Thank you, doctor.Take care
of your daughter for me. - Yes.

27:49.922 --> 27:51.621
Sieg Heil!

27:59.987 --> 28:03.412
See you in Valhalla.

28:27.884 --> 28:31.401
UPSTATE,  NEW YORK

28:55.186 --> 28:59.347
- You smell that?
- No. We don’t have time to waste.

29:00.036 --> 29:02.333
Take me to that president of yours.

29:02.434 --> 29:05.282
What? The President?

29:05.783 --> 29:09.463
Come on man, I thought you want me
to take you to Mac store or something.

29:11.236 --> 29:16.969
You said that you would know the President
of The United States of the Americas.

29:17.070 --> 29:19.655
Right, of course.

29:20.656 --> 29:22.200
That President.

29:29.588 --> 29:32.929
May I meet this President too?

29:32.930 --> 29:35.848
Renate! What are you doing here?

29:35.849 --> 29:39.450
Hey, Miss. Richter,
welcome to my planet.

29:39.981 --> 29:43.404
This is not the place for the mother
of the children of the future Führer.

29:43.501 --> 29:46.416
And definitely not the place
for a woman.

29:51.653 --> 29:54.528
My place is by my man.

29:59.084 --> 30:02.494
- Get the hell out of my property.
- We better get out of here!

30:05.000 --> 30:06.650
Run for it!

30:12.200 --> 30:15.145
New York City

30:23.464 --> 30:26.042
A Volkswagen bus.

30:27.538 --> 30:29.725
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now, hold on there Boss man.

30:29.750 --> 30:33.002
That may not be the sharpest move.
Look, look. I'll tell you what.

30:33.003 --> 30:37.749
Let me go talk to the brothers. All right?
They know me, you know. I'm one of them.

30:37.850 --> 30:39.563
Are you with me?

30:40.600 --> 30:43.018
Yeah! Yeah!
Now you're talking.

30:43.065 --> 30:45.474
All right, now.

30:49.100 --> 30:51.100
Wassup?

30:51.140 --> 30:54.023
- Doesn't he know?
- No. He'll be thrilled.

30:56.483 --> 30:58.724
I'm serious. You don't know how good
it's to see you all man.  It's like...

30:59.330 --> 31:00.724
- little Africa up in this bitch.
- Thank you.

31:00.750 --> 31:02.888
Come on people. You all know me.
I know you do.

31:04.900 --> 31:07.000
- Washington.
- I mean ...

31:08.195 --> 31:11.800
That ain't one of yours, is it?
Because...ah, look man.

31:11.901 --> 31:13.501
You ain't got to
bring that shit out.

31:13.549 --> 31:15.952
Look man, it's all good.
Look, I'm a peace loving brother, man.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.383
Fuck it, man!
Yo! Yo!

31:24.259 --> 31:25.600
Are you all right?

31:25.731 --> 31:28.931
Do I fucking look alright to you
Miss crazy fucking Nazi?

31:29.068 --> 31:31.634
I mean...
What the hell just happen?

31:31.835 --> 31:33.350
You know?

31:39.053 --> 31:42.957
Oh, no mother-effin way!

31:49.942 --> 31:52.051
What did you sick
sons-a-bitches do to me?

31:52.088 --> 31:55.382
- I should've told you. - What?
That I look like a fucking polar bear?

31:56.594 --> 31:59.935
You know what? You two really, really
know how to fuck up a guys Christmas.

32:00.078 --> 32:03.652
Quiet, you fool!
What is wrong with you?

32:03.920 --> 32:06.850
We made you Aryan,
you're one of us now.

32:06.860 --> 32:09.305
- You should be thanking us.
- Thanking you?

32:09.477 --> 32:13.389
What I should have done is let those
brother come here with their size 15s

32:13.400 --> 32:16.880
and put a foot so far up in your ass,
can taste the toe nails for 2 fucking weeks.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.624
Klaus!

32:24.192 --> 32:28.203
Bring me to your leader,
James Washington.

32:40.619 --> 32:43.725
Hey, what the fuck?
Excuse me.

32:43.829 --> 32:46.502
Get your fucking hands off me,
you mother...

32:47.642 --> 32:51.015
- You can...- Is she your boss?
- Yes, she's the big cheese.

32:51.067 --> 32:53.715
- And she knows the president?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. They real tight.

32:57.695 --> 32:59.158
Come on.

33:01.497 --> 33:05.500
You fuckin' animal!
Do you know who I am, huh? Do you?

33:05.609 --> 33:08.621
You just kidnapped the wrong woman
The wrong fucking woman.

33:09.469 --> 33:13.735
Oh yeah. I hope you're having a good time
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

33:25.368 --> 33:26.969
Excellent.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.994
My turn.

33:30.183 --> 33:34.000
I am Commander Klaus Adler of the 4th Reich
We are based on the Moon.

33:34.150 --> 33:38.000
I'm told you know the president
of the United States of the Americas.

33:38.013 --> 33:40.811
You will take us to that
the President, because ...

33:40.926 --> 33:44.611
- I have a very special present for him.
- Him?

33:44.653 --> 33:47.100
Well he'll love that.
He just loves presents.

33:47.130 --> 33:48.955
As soon as my mission is accomplished

33:49.000 --> 33:51.947
Nazi invading forces
will be called in under my directions

33:52.000 --> 33:55.500
and we will end the good
times for the bad people.

33:55.552 --> 33:57.882
And just how do you propose
to do that?

33:58.790 --> 34:01.550
- We will simply eliminate them.
- What?

34:03.217 --> 34:07.287
- Sorry, that is not what we were told...
- Renate, I do not think that you...

34:12.538 --> 34:15.083
Yeah. Why not?

34:15.341 --> 34:19.867
Why don't you tell this fräulein why
we're here, just like you keep telling your pupils.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.393
I would love to do that.

34:23.449 --> 34:24.873
You see...

34:25.052 --> 34:28.300
the National Socialist Party
is the people's party, nothing more.

34:28.800 --> 34:34.016
We wish to return to Earth
with our message of peace and unity

34:34.089 --> 34:37.007
love through virtue.

34:37.087 --> 34:40.251
And kindness, for example.

34:40.485 --> 34:44.120
We are healthy,
in mind and body.

34:44.202 --> 34:48.081
Our spirits are brave and true.

34:48.128 --> 34:53.398
We achieved that because we are strong,
disciplined in our cause.

34:54.437 --> 34:57.164
There is simply no belief
that can match ours...

34:57.289 --> 35:02.654
because peace and unity is the gift
that we bring to all mankind.

35:04.631 --> 35:08.860
- What you and all earthlings need to know ...
- Yeah, yeah. I get it.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.485
This is good.

35:15.239 --> 35:17.004
This is gonna work.

35:18.255 --> 35:20.901
You, I need.

35:22.081 --> 35:24.350
And you...

35:24.997 --> 35:26.942
I want.

35:27.195 --> 35:30.364
Alright, let's go meet the president.

35:51.254 --> 35:53.000
Madam President ...

35:54.075 --> 35:56.400
here is the miracle
you asked for.

36:15.475 --> 36:19.163
- Who is this man?
- He will lead the campaign troops.

36:28.048 --> 36:30.636
Renate, please...

36:36.006 --> 36:37.854
It's very simple.

36:38.605 --> 36:40.281
The world is sick...

36:41.075 --> 36:43.476
and we are the doctors.

36:43.989 --> 36:47.600
The world has anemic
and we are the vitamin.

36:47.840 --> 36:51.500
The world is weary,
but we are the strength.

36:52.011 --> 36:55.582
We are here to make
the world healthy once again.

36:55.872 --> 36:57.537
With hard work...

36:58.251 --> 37:02.700
with honesty, with clarity,
with decency.

37:03.700 --> 37:10.666
We are the product of
loving mothers and brave fathers.

37:11.790 --> 37:16.878
We are the embodiment
of love and bravery.

37:17.267 --> 37:22.710
We are the gift of both
God and science.

37:23.200 --> 37:26.300
We are the answer to the question.

37:26.939 --> 37:31.214
We are the promise delivered
to all mankind.

37:32.200 --> 37:36.250
For that we raise our hand,
to one nation.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.189
We step to the beat of one drum

37:39.285 --> 37:42.600
We march to the beat of one heart
on this world.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.310
We are the people who will carry
the children on our shoulders.

37:47.389 --> 37:51.556
In the same way as our fathers carried
us and their fathers before them.

37:52.147 --> 37:56.173
We are the one people united
and strong.

37:56.470 --> 38:01.302
We are the one people with certainty.
Moral certainty.

38:01.606 --> 38:05.611
We are invincible
and we have no fear.

38:07.474 --> 38:12.200
Because the truth makes us one.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.100
THREE MONTHS LATER

38:28.177 --> 38:31.939
The moon Nazis are coming. What's wrong
with you people, can't you see?

38:32.023 --> 38:33.949
Look, I've been there.
I'm telling you.

38:34.016 --> 38:38.100
They have all this moon base, they got this whole
like space thing goin' on, and they comin' to take over.

38:38.150 --> 38:41.850
Oh, you never listen to this right?
Listen now 'cause they comin, they comin'.

38:41.918 --> 38:46.650
They coming to get us all. Why
aren't you guys listening to me? I mean...

38:49.301 --> 38:50.769
Renate.

38:51.450 --> 38:53.360
Washington.
James Washington.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.500
- I'm so glad to see you alive.
- Is that you? 

38:55.510 --> 38:56.801
Yeah!

38:56.897 --> 39:00.100
Look I got one! This is the bitch 
that made me white as a fuckin' snowflake.

39:00.150 --> 39:01.900
Come on people, help me!

39:12.760 --> 39:14.444
Help me!

39:14.929 --> 39:16.915
I saved your life.

39:21.002 --> 39:26.072
So, you're a formerly
dead, black model...

39:26.143 --> 39:28.859
who is now suddenly
a living white hobo

39:28.919 --> 39:33.200
after spending a weekend
on the Moon. Is that correct?

39:33.300 --> 39:37.026
- Yes, that's correct.
- Huh, so I was listening.

39:37.153 --> 39:42.650
And you're Neil Armstrong after
his sex change operation. Is this correct?

39:43.005 --> 39:46.377
No, that is not correct.
You were not listening at all.

39:46.837 --> 39:49.304
My name is Richter.
Renate Richter.

39:49.354 --> 39:54.705
I tried to save this man's life and
I think he's stupid, childish and ungrateful.

39:55.041 --> 39:59.742
Okay. Ask Miss. Moon-Nazi here, was I,
or was I not on the dark side of the Moon.

40:02.007 --> 40:05.400
Yes, Mr. James Washington was
on the dark side of the Moon.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.700
There, what did I tell you.

40:07.900 --> 40:12.600
I am black, but now I'm white. I went to
the dark side of the moon, but I'm now back.

40:12.620 --> 40:15.430
And the Nazis are coming to kill us all.

40:15.500 --> 40:19.504
And you guys are gonna so sorry
that you didn't listened to me.

40:23.170 --> 40:27.402
Mr. James Washington,
why are you so upset? So angry?

40:27.621 --> 40:30.447
- Get lost.
- But I don't understand.

40:30.527 --> 40:33.057
I mean...we made you white.

40:33.299 --> 40:36.864
We taught you about National Socialists
message, about peace and unity.

40:36.935 --> 40:40.281
You people have robbed me of everything.

40:40.347 --> 40:43.010
My race, my identity, my career.

40:43.071 --> 40:47.132
And I'm beginning to think I am flipping
mind too. I mean just everything.

40:47.572 --> 40:49.494
Do you know this?

40:50.621 --> 40:51.847
Yes.

40:52.544 --> 40:54.096
Wonderful.

40:54.097 --> 40:55.397
Come on.

40:55.884 --> 40:59.509
Come on in. I will explain it to you
then you'll understand it.

41:02.083 --> 41:05.181
You're a one strange broad.
I'll give you that.

41:05.833 --> 41:07.630
You know, you'll pay
the popcorn.

41:07.640 --> 41:12.442
125 MINUTES LATER

41:14.050 --> 41:16.523
Man, that was bullshit.

41:23.587 --> 41:25.020
It was...

41:25.940 --> 41:30.481
- It was so long.
- Yeah. They coulda edited it down a bit.

41:31.579 --> 41:33.659
He was mocking the Führer.

41:34.246 --> 41:37.237
I'm getting a sense there's a lot
about Nazis you don't know.

41:38.191 --> 41:41.990
- But I am a Nazi.
- Yeah, I know but you are not like...

41:42.713 --> 41:47.107
Well like them.
A bunch of stupid bullies.

41:48.097 --> 41:50.630
No, I'm sure they're good boys

41:50.744 --> 41:53.425
and loyal to the Reich,
and their mothers.

41:53.622 --> 41:56.229
Look, they are wearing the symbol of love.

41:56.596 --> 41:59.016
- The swastika?
- Yeah.

41:59.112 --> 42:01.053
I have never heard they call it
that before.

42:01.224 --> 42:03.795
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

42:09.000 --> 42:11.650
- Good evening, boys.
- What have we there?

42:11.800 --> 42:14.640
What we got here, blond hair, blue
eyes, nice rack.

42:14.680 --> 42:17.095
Even Hitler would get a hard-on.

42:18.021 --> 42:22.800
- I got this. Look guys, we don't want
any trouble. - Why don't you get lost hobo.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.050
Look, I got the funniest story to tell you.
Your not gonna believe this...

42:25.080 --> 42:27.071
Stop that, that is enough.

42:30.248 --> 42:33.018
What she needs is a good war.

42:33.214 --> 42:36.597
A war always make the president popular.

42:36.663 --> 42:41.176
Well, I might be able 
to help her out there.

42:42.509 --> 42:44.074
How do you mean?

42:44.201 --> 42:48.310
One word from me, and the invasion
from the Moon begins.

42:52.508 --> 42:55.417
- You never break character do you?
- No.

42:56.746 --> 42:59.375
I can never be broken.

43:00.051 --> 43:02.648
- You smell so good.
- The time has come.

43:04.541 --> 43:06.493
I will show you my plans.

43:07.301 --> 43:08.900
Come back here.

43:17.642 --> 43:19.808
Look, look.
I've mapped out some things.

43:20.551 --> 43:21.946
Oh, big fella.

43:22.044 --> 43:23.900
All work and no play?

43:30.335 --> 43:34.086
Now listen, do you think
if I asphyxiate the president...

43:34.145 --> 43:36.523
will the troops stand in line with us?

43:38.202 --> 43:41.682
When I order the moon invasion.

43:42.315 --> 43:44.233
it will be quietless bloodshed

43:45.566 --> 43:49.014
After I eliminate the Moon Führer,
of course.

43:59.874 --> 44:01.537
Klaus Adler.

44:11.787 --> 44:13.024
Heil Hitler!

44:14.482 --> 44:17.015
You name's not 'Hitler!

44:18.371 --> 44:23.250
So Klaus, is the clown joining us?

44:24.768 --> 44:27.093
What, did you all buy tickets?

44:29.636 --> 44:32.991
Okay, so, do you want to introduce
me to your friends?

44:34.509 --> 44:37.664
Get your hooks off me
you crystal noob piece-of-shit!

44:38.925 --> 44:41.836
I can make this worth your while.
Just please let me go.

44:41.897 --> 44:44.714
Do it, Moon Corporal.

44:55.214 --> 45:01.829
And you want to eliminate
the Mondführer?

45:05.436 --> 45:09.714
Do you know
the penalty for high treason?

45:15.976 --> 45:19.741
<i>This is flagship Siegfried speaking.</i>

45:19.837 --> 45:23.765
<i>We've reached the orbit and we're
ready for the Valkyries to start.</i>

45:25.000 --> 45:26.766
<i>Battleship Heinrich ready for attack.</i>

45:27.267 --> 45:29.967
<i>Battleship Biterolf ready for attack.</i>

45:37.820 --> 45:41.253
- The fleet is ready, mein Führer.
- Excellent.

45:41.474 --> 45:44.226
They have to wait for my return.

45:44.311 --> 45:50.120
We shall then begin
the Meteorblitzkrieg.

45:50.212 --> 45:55.315
We'll wipe all these sub-humans...

45:55.432 --> 45:58.508
off the face of the Earth.

45:58.809 --> 46:00.409
Klaus!

46:09.517 --> 46:13.554
I need to tell you that I have
nothing to do with you or your plans.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.800
You Nazi-piece-of-shit.

46:17.531 --> 46:21.174
Oh well.
A blessing in disguise.

46:21.270 --> 46:25.285
Now I can kill all the enemies
of the Reich in one stroke.

46:28.291 --> 46:31.941
Farewell, puppet Führer.

47:06.292 --> 47:09.247
He fell for the old one
last blow job offer.

47:11.452 --> 47:13.899
God, nazis are stupid.

47:14.358 --> 47:16.714
I commend you
on your marksmanship.

47:21.945 --> 47:26.555
Shame. She was such a nice girl
Just have to kill her later.

47:27.813 --> 47:30.161
So, it was real?

47:30.293 --> 47:34.807
- All this time.
- Never doubt a Nazi, schöne fräulein.

47:42.200 --> 47:45.057
Farwell, fashionista.

47:46.083 --> 47:48.348
I have a planet to conquer.

48:14.026 --> 48:18.651
I will just grab this.

48:19.169 --> 48:20.521
Bye!

48:22.823 --> 48:24.901
Good luck with the rest of your life.

48:26.701 --> 48:29.070
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

48:33.447 --> 48:36.881
They develop like ordinary women.
But look.

48:36.978 --> 48:41.343
Here, no hair, no hair.
Like little girls.

48:41.892 --> 48:46.428
And when they do have hair,
it looks like...

48:46.692 --> 48:49.726
the mustache of
our great Führer.

48:51.601 --> 48:54.026
The pictures kind of turn me on.

48:55.700 --> 48:57.306
Sieg Heil!

49:06.251 --> 49:07.820
Mr. Adler.

49:08.200 --> 49:10.056
Where is the Führer?

49:11.070 --> 49:14.870
The Führer is dead.
Long live the new Führer.

49:14.965 --> 49:17.734
That's me, in case
you're wondering.

49:23.671 --> 49:24.992
Sieg Heil!

49:25.464 --> 49:26.929
This way.

49:28.630 --> 49:30.030
Klaus!

49:52.294 --> 49:53.867
Heil Hitler!

49:57.722 --> 50:02.105
From now on, of course
it is "Heil Adler".

50:13.714 --> 50:16.287
Time is

50:16.859 --> 50:18.822
the sin.

50:19.847 --> 50:21.635
I'll see you in Valhalla.

51:04.567 --> 51:07.588
At 5.45 we'll start firing back.

51:08.084 --> 51:11.878
Every bomb will be retaliated.

51:12.068 --> 51:15.093
The Meteorblitzkrieg shall begin!

51:53.384 --> 51:57.278
Thank you, Kelly. Moments ago
New York has been under attack.

51:57.355 --> 52:02.600
Witness claim to have seen hundred of UFO's
appearing suddenly over the city and opening fire.

52:03.171 --> 52:06.886
Billy get that! Get that!
Are you getting that?

52:06.952 --> 52:09.586
Kelly, the craft is at least 60 feet across.

52:09.654 --> 52:13.986
I'm seeing what appears to be weapons
of some-kind dangling down from the bottom.

52:14.010 --> 52:17.581
Oh my God! It's opening fire!
It's opening fire!

52:17.590 --> 52:18.882
I'm getting the hell out of here.

52:18.953 --> 52:22.063
<i>There is little information.
But here's what we know at this time.</i>

52:22.316 --> 52:26.276
- Ok you see the thing is, that Klaus...
- I know it was you doing.

52:27.483 --> 52:30.912
- It's wonderful.
- It's wonderful?

52:31.168 --> 52:33.995
It's brilliant. I'm a wartime
president now.

52:34.068 --> 52:36.778
All presidents who start
a war in their first term

52:36.779 --> 52:40.038
always get re-elected, I thought, I was
gonna have to bomb Australia or something.

52:40.512 --> 52:43.594
But no, you bring me real...

52:44.704 --> 52:48.110
- Who are these guys anyway?
- Nazis.

52:48.615 --> 52:52.744
- From the moon.
- Real life Nazis?

52:52.851 --> 52:55.805
Holy shit, this just keeps
getting better and better.

52:55.870 --> 52:58.700
You are a miracle worker babe.

52:58.871 --> 53:03.252
They are the only guys we ever actually
managed to beat in a fair fight?

53:04.825 --> 53:08.114
I'm just like Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Only, you know, I'm not spastic.

53:08.222 --> 53:10.446
I knew you would be excited.

53:10.724 --> 53:17.188
So, if you’re our Roosevelt, then who's your
General Patton or you know, MacArthur?

53:17.506 --> 53:20.161
Mr Secretary of Defense,
do you have any thought on this?

53:20.200 --> 53:21.736
Send her.

53:23.837 --> 53:26.526
- Me?
- Hey you're the miracle worker.

53:26.628 --> 53:29.018
Apparently you dodge bullets too.

53:29.609 --> 53:33.576
- I wouldn't know... - What to wear?
You will think of something, you always do.

53:33.661 --> 53:35.269
Madam President...

53:35.966 --> 53:37.900
ready to face the music?

54:05.072 --> 54:08.721
It's the space Nazis!

54:26.185 --> 54:29.595
Take us upstate.
We need to go back to the Moon.

54:29.691 --> 54:31.700
We? No, no, no! See?
We rhymes with me.

54:31.710 --> 54:33.249
- And ain't going.
- Than, you don't get it!

54:33.250 --> 54:34.955
They have the Götterdämmerung
on the Moon.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.365
I don't give a damn
what they have.

54:36.436 --> 54:39.736
- I'm not going back, to that place. No way!
- You want to look like that for the rest of your life?

54:39.821 --> 54:42.535
Great, now this is my fault.

54:44.215 --> 54:48.607
- Let me in.
- I am no hero, James.

54:49.159 --> 54:51.080
I need you.

55:30.312 --> 55:32.664
Do you know how to drive this thing?

55:33.636 --> 55:37.813
Well can't be any different than
playing 'wing commander'

55:37.856 --> 55:40.472
Let's try...

56:05.547 --> 56:09.441
I swear we do not have
nothing on the Moon.

56:09.508 --> 56:11.368
- Japan?
- It is not ours.

56:11.439 --> 56:13.041
- China?
- It is not us.

56:13.109 --> 56:15.058
It's bloody well not ours.

56:15.101 --> 56:18.738
- I confess.
- Yes, North Korea? Confess to what?

56:18.822 --> 56:21.032
The spaceships are ours.

56:21.912 --> 56:26.437
Our beloved leader designed
and build it himself.

56:32.805 --> 56:37.492
- What's so funny?
- All right, North Korea. Sit down.

56:50.186 --> 56:54.813
- So, it was you India, I knew that.
- No, no! This is a sign of peace.

56:54.909 --> 56:58.084
- This is the sign of peace.
- Just cut it out, you morons!

56:58.155 --> 57:03.341
These thugs are Nazis
and I mean the real, McCoy.

57:03.533 --> 57:06.487
They have been hiding
on the Moon just waiting to pounce.

57:06.696 --> 57:10.224
My question is, what do
you all planning to do about it?

57:10.284 --> 57:13.477
'Cause we just happen to have a little
something up our own sleeve.

57:13.550 --> 57:16.540
And I'm sure that you'll
be thankful for it.

57:16.730 --> 57:22.756
May I present to you with the Mars
exploration ship, The USS George W. Bush.

57:27.101 --> 57:29.964
Good work, take it to Officer Tyler,
please.

57:33.126 --> 57:36.535
This is trajectory, what's our status
on the orbit window?

57:36.961 --> 57:38.998
Commander on deck.

57:49.648 --> 57:53.681
The hostile fleet has launched a full scale 
aerial attack against the United States.

57:53.771 --> 57:58.752
These Zeppelins appear to be carriers and they
are operating fully within the thermosphere.

57:58.807 --> 58:03.610
Each of them approximately carrying 200
enemy vessels, and are extremely...

58:04.308 --> 58:07.300
Hell hath no fury, Heir Adler.

58:07.686 --> 58:10.931
Alright kiddies, let's get
this show on the road.

58:20.673 --> 58:23.847
Vivian, you look great.
How is it going up there?

58:23.896 --> 58:25.835
Madam President, I couldn't be better.

58:25.896 --> 58:28.667
I am packing dozens of mega tons
of nuclear warheads

58:28.714 --> 58:32.334
which I am going to carefully
place up Klaus's kraut ass.

58:32.382 --> 58:35.575
- Just as soon I get him in my sight.
- Carry on, kick butt.

58:35.641 --> 58:38.353
Let's see what that baby can do!

59:10.725 --> 59:14.734
Working at optimum capacity.
Ammo consumption within tolerance.

59:28.570 --> 59:33.589
We're coming under extremely heavy fire.
We gonna need reinforcement right now.

59:36.129 --> 59:37.774
What the hell is the meaning of this?

59:37.828 --> 59:40.900
Good day mates. This is Australian ship,
Dundee 01. Ready to kick ass.

59:41.009 --> 59:42.827
Spitfire reporting in.

59:42.994 --> 59:45.808
Hanging in there W.
Canada joining the battle.

59:45.835 --> 59:48.476
This is a direct violation of
this nations space treaty that

59:48.507 --> 59:50.699
you all signed, every single one of you.

59:50.800 --> 59:53.320
MIR is ready to join the battle.

59:57.209 --> 59:59.526
That was supposed
to be destroyed.

59:59.879 --> 01:00:04.005
This is an outrage, you're all
liars, just like my ex ex-husband.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:09.476
- Calm down lady, calm down.
- Don't you lady me, Pinko.

01:00:09.524 --> 01:00:11.752
Okay, who didn't armed
their spaceship?

01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:15.262
Great, great. That's just great

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.350
- You all gave me your word.
- But you broke yours.

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:21.087
We always break ours,
that's just what we do.

01:00:21.548 --> 01:00:23.562
Okay, fine, fine, fine!

01:00:23.634 --> 01:00:27.507
Let just beat shit out of these pricks
and talk about the details later.

01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:52.909
Heroes of the First Fleet,

01:00:53.038 --> 01:00:55.543
continue your attack to the last man

01:00:55.659 --> 01:00:58.269
and remember you're fighting
for the Reich!

01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:00.270
<i>Where the hell did they come from?</i>

01:01:05.844 --> 01:01:09.165
Prepare an appropriate uniform
for the Führer.

01:01:17.193 --> 01:01:20.599
The Fatherland is calling
its children!

01:01:20.852 --> 01:01:27.600
This device will complete
the biggest war machine of all times.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.400
- The Götterdämmerung will fly!
- Heil Adler!

01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:57.223
This is beautiful.

01:02:07.107 --> 01:02:10.400
- Where the hell are we going?
- To the Götterdämmerung.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.100
I think Klaus will be there.

01:02:22.812 --> 01:02:24.900
What did you think of that?
Adler?

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:27.240
Alright, what about this
Moon business?

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:30.373
What do you say we head on over
and slap them around a bit?

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:35.273
Klaus, baby I'm coming
to get to get ya'.

01:02:46.845 --> 01:02:49.018
Attention!

01:02:50.232 --> 01:02:52.100
Heil Adler!

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.180
Heil!

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.927
As you were.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.165
Well?

01:03:03.711 --> 01:03:07.783
The Earth fleet will be
within firing range in 20 minutes.

01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:15.000
- Are your troops ready?
- We're waiting for Dr. Richter.

01:03:25.258 --> 01:03:29.146
- What the hell is this place?
- This is the Götterdämmerung.

01:03:29.262 --> 01:03:31.497
It will liberate the Earth.

01:03:31.897 --> 01:03:33.673
Actually,

01:03:34.259 --> 01:03:36.900
it is the biggest war
machine ever created by man.

01:03:42.023 --> 01:03:47.655
- This is the bridge. There's where I'm going.
- I need to find your father, so...

01:03:47.751 --> 01:03:50.893
- Where do you think he at?
- I think you will find him over there.

01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:54.915
Try to sneak in, and please
paralyze the engines.

01:03:55.339 --> 01:04:00.509
- Or otherwise the earth is destroyed.
- Note to self, paralyze the engines. Got it.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.900
- Oh. No, no no no. - What?
- You be careful.

01:04:05.011 --> 01:04:06.604
- I mean you know...
- What?

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:10.745
- Because you like me.
- Right...

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.515
Oh, come on, a little.
I mean...

01:04:18.045 --> 01:04:19.491
You like me?

01:04:37.569 --> 01:04:40.575
We have a visual on the
Nazi fortress, commander.

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:45.201
Obvious and overstated
as usually,Klaus.

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.713
Alright, everyone,
let's get those nukes in action.

01:04:48.827 --> 01:04:52.376
- I'm declaring this fortress a free-fire-zone.
- But Commander,there are woman and children down there.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.451
The United States of America
does not negotiate with terrorists.

01:05:00.918 --> 01:05:03.999
- Prime warhead on secondary armament.
- Roger that.

01:05:04.444 --> 01:05:07.500
- Prepare all available ordinance for ground
bombardment.- Fire the fucking nukes!

01:05:10.664 --> 01:05:12.202
Nukes away.

01:05:47.713 --> 01:05:49.300
Job well done!

01:05:54.561 --> 01:05:55.905
Move!

01:06:01.382 --> 01:06:04.303
Who dares disturb me?

01:06:04.998 --> 01:06:07.037
Dr. Richter!

01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:11.117
-  How much time do you need?
-  The Götterdämmerung will fly.

01:06:11.518 --> 01:06:14.418
It will be ready
for  the final victory.

01:06:14.633 --> 01:06:16.995
Cut the crap.
How long?

01:06:17.009 --> 01:06:19.610
Let's say three months,
give or take a little.

01:06:19.711 --> 01:06:21.711
Maybe a little earlier, maybe later.

01:06:21.825 --> 01:06:23.859
You have three minutes.

01:06:25.503 --> 01:06:29.300
He cut me off. It's not that easy.
Russia wasn't conquered in a day...

01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:30.776
Hey, quack!

01:06:31.352 --> 01:06:32.800
You remember me?

01:06:32.901 --> 01:06:34.101
No.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:37.200
The Moon spook you
turn into a snowflake.

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:44.222
Start the Helium-3 engines.

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:51.045
Now!

01:06:54.398 --> 01:06:56.421
Start the engines.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.200
Oh shit, it's alive

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:45.138
He sure  must have the smallest
dick in the universe.

01:07:49.022 --> 01:07:50.567
Load the cannons.

01:07:53.295 --> 01:07:54.982
Time...

01:07:58.648 --> 01:08:00.442
to fuck back.

01:08:14.055 --> 01:08:16.991
Everyone, take positions around
this fat phallus

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.928
and wait for my command
to open fire.

01:08:27.054 --> 01:08:29.874
- Offensive run confirmed.
- Let her rip.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:39.180
Shit!

01:08:41.259 --> 01:08:43.353
- Are the cannon ready to fire?
- They are.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:47.399
But the Earth is below the horizon,
on the other side of the Moon.

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.316
We can't shoot.

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:51.895
Full moon was yesterday.

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:55.510
Let's make a brand new horizon.

01:08:55.526 --> 01:08:57.255
Fire at will.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.460
What the fuck?

01:10:03.583 --> 01:10:08.634
Reactivate the system.
Weapons sergeant.

01:10:28.045 --> 01:10:30.112
We'll see...

01:10:31.658 --> 01:10:35.060
The projectiles of Götterdämmerung
are made out of metallic hydrogen.

01:10:35.376 --> 01:10:39.044
it's aggregate state can only be reached
under immense pressure...

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.542
<i>National Anthem.
For motivation, break glass.</i>

01:10:42.543 --> 01:10:44.543
The impact can be quite diverse.

01:11:06.063 --> 01:11:07.800
It's no time to sing now!

01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:11.848
It's a false alarm!

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:22.200
Are you all imbeciles?
Go and see what's going on!

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.200
On the double!

01:11:47.334 --> 01:11:51.420
- Renate.
- I won't let you do it.

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:55.300
What will you do?
Shoot me?

01:12:10.821 --> 01:12:12.784
Good girl...

01:12:15.055 --> 01:12:18.478
Renate Richter, my bride-to-be.

01:12:18.683 --> 01:12:22.022
You destroyed something beautiful,
something wonderful.

01:12:22.036 --> 01:12:25.408
A future world
full of Aryan children.

01:12:25.503 --> 01:12:27.785
Our Aryan children!

01:12:30.255 --> 01:12:34.441
But you betrayed me,
and for that you shall pay.

01:12:35.757 --> 01:12:38.849
Your beauty should adorn/
decorate Odin's table.

01:12:38.964 --> 01:12:42.973
- Klaus! Wait! Let me say something.
- Now?

01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:47.812
- I'm a bit busy.
- I have always respected you.

01:12:48.627 --> 01:12:50.878
As Führer,

01:12:51.026 --> 01:12:52.558
and as a man.

01:12:53.213 --> 01:12:55.673
I've even loved you.

01:12:55.894 --> 01:12:58.073
I belong to you.

01:12:58.589 --> 01:13:00.092
To you.

01:13:01.007 --> 01:13:02.792
Cute little speech.

01:13:03.808 --> 01:13:06.406
But it is too late, my dear.
Goodbye.

01:13:06.707 --> 01:13:09.507
I understand.
I heil you.

01:13:10.921 --> 01:13:12.669
My Klaus.

01:13:14.504 --> 01:13:17.383
Sieg Heil, my Führer.

01:13:34.195 --> 01:13:37.902
- Washington, do you hear me? Washington?
- Where are you?

01:13:38.018 --> 01:13:40.871
- You need to shut down the engine
- I'm working on it.

01:13:40.872 --> 01:13:42.172
Shit...

01:15:50.359 --> 01:15:52.614
Congratulations.

01:15:53.406 --> 01:15:54.989
High five.

01:15:57.481 --> 01:15:59.545
Well, that was disappointing.

01:16:03.038 --> 01:16:06.400
Do you think he suffered?
Even just a little?

01:16:06.506 --> 01:16:11.997
Vivian, I knew you could do it. You're foxy
and salacious, all the way. Congratulations.

01:16:12.645 --> 01:16:15.400
- What's Helium-3?
- Helium.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.970
Did you say Helium-3?

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.189
Yes, there is like about 15 to 20 giant towers
that appear to be full of this stuff.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.250
- That's ours.
- It is? Why?

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:30.000
Helium-3, will make the U.S. independent
of all energy needs for next thousand years.

01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:32.900
Yes, it is ours.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.350
No, no no. Hear me out.
Hear me out.

01:16:37.516 --> 01:16:40.923
The moon is American soil.
Moon flag, stars and stripes.

01:16:41.038 --> 01:16:43.373
Who beat the Moon Nazis?
We did.

01:16:43.489 --> 01:16:47.671
Well, yeah yeah, alright, you help out here and there,
but ultimately it's just like World War II ...

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:49.482
and who won that?
We did.

01:16:49.996 --> 01:16:52.906
- You lie.
- You don't believe me?

01:16:53.001 --> 01:16:55.355
Watch the movie.
Movies do not lie.

01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:58.026
Not the shoes, Jesus.

01:16:59.141 --> 01:17:01.272
Vivian, this is the Secretary of Defense.

01:17:01.287 --> 01:17:04.850
- Defend Helium-3 at all costs.
- But against who?

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:07.009
Against everybody!

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:44.854
Please don't, never again!

01:18:45.055 --> 01:18:46.755
Please stop.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.630
What was the Earth like?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.300
Different.

01:19:09.007 --> 01:19:11.082
When can we go there?

01:19:12.026 --> 01:19:14.080
Soon. Soon...

01:19:17.887 --> 01:19:20.162
- But how?
- In peace.

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:30.326
Unfortunately that's the story
of revenge. It's messy.

01:19:30.442 --> 01:19:33.988
Never really works out the way
you wanted to.

01:19:35.297 --> 01:19:37.501
I feel lonely.

01:19:38.489 --> 01:19:42.347
The eternal love of God, the love of God
into our hearts, or we will burn...

01:19:42.463 --> 01:19:45.556
burn in hell,
burning in eternal damnation.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.746
Renate.

01:19:50.692 --> 01:19:52.009
Washington.

01:20:05.288 --> 01:20:06.792
You are alive.

01:20:08.208 --> 01:20:11.880
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:22.340
And you're the way 
you meant to be.

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.824
Are you aware that
you are kissing a black man?

01:20:45.002 --> 01:20:48.090
I guess you have a lot of work
cut out for you.
