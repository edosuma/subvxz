00:30.256 --> 00:32.009
- [lock screen clicks]
- Fuck.

00:33.385 --> 00:34.553
Oh, shit.

00:38.932 --> 00:41.351
- Yeah, I did for a...
- [ringtone beeping]

00:44.980 --> 00:47.566
Hey, um, it's Chip.

00:49.651 --> 00:54.656
So, I must be doing something wrong
'cause I can't seem to get through to you.

00:54.740 --> 00:58.744
[rock music playing]

01:32.027 --> 01:33.653
[whimpering]

02:06.770 --> 02:08.479
Goddamn it.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.447
[exhales]

02:18.824 --> 02:20.826
- Hey, Chip. [Panting]
- Hey.

02:21.576 --> 02:25.497
- Wasn't sure if you got my message.
- How can I be of service?

02:25.622 --> 02:28.333
Yeah, that... no, no, no.
This is more of a real life problem.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.835
Oh, you want to talk about the store?

02:29.918 --> 02:33.546
Yeah, and about your friend
who lives above the store.

02:33.630 --> 02:35.799
- London?
- Yes, London.

02:35.882 --> 02:39.678
Hey! Don't stop! Keep going!
Come on! Keep your back straight!

02:39.761 --> 02:41.638
- Sorry.
- Let's go!

02:41.721 --> 02:46.977
You're, um...
helping your buddy move, or...?

02:47.060 --> 02:50.605
No, way, man. This is his gym.
You've never heard of boxercising?

02:50.689 --> 02:53.483
It's the best way to get
symmetrical muscle definition.

02:53.566 --> 02:55.944
And work experience, right?

02:56.945 --> 02:58.780
- [trainer] Let's go!
- Oh, man.

02:58.864 --> 03:02.701
- So, how well do you know her?
- London? Yeah, I know her a little bit.

03:02.784 --> 03:05.787
Do you know her well enough
to ask her out?

03:05.871 --> 03:08.414
Oh. [Chuckles]
It's actually kind of complicated.

03:08.498 --> 03:11.084
No, I meant for me, not for you.

03:11.168 --> 03:13.545
Right. You want me
to ask her out for you.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.255
Yeah.

03:15.338 --> 03:20.844
What? You know I could float it by her.
I can't make any promises.

03:20.927 --> 03:24.223
Okay. Well, I should get back to this.
[clears throat]

03:24.305 --> 03:27.433
Yeah. I've got to get back
to my store, so... Our store.

03:27.517 --> 03:29.435
- Do I need to follow up on that?
- No, no.

03:29.519 --> 03:31.188
Don't even worry about it, brother.
I talked to my guy.

03:31.271 --> 03:33.815
- Things are looking good.
- Good.

03:33.899 --> 03:37.777
- So, then should he talk to my guy?
- Oh, who's your guy?

03:38.570 --> 03:41.364
- Well, me. I'm my guy.
- [chuckles]

03:41.447 --> 03:43.449
No, he's going to talk to me
and I'm going to talk to you, okay?

03:43.533 --> 03:45.326
We've still got a lot of numbers
to look through.

03:45.410 --> 03:47.913
Right. Good. Yeah.

03:47.996 --> 03:51.250
That's what I'd do. Good business.

04:29.704 --> 04:32.457
[seagulls cawing in distance]

04:48.765 --> 04:51.392
[sighs] Fucking Cooler, man.
He set us up.

04:52.311 --> 04:53.728
This is...

04:54.771 --> 04:57.983
Come on, Dennis. Come on, man.
We're here. Let's just... Let's talk.

04:58.066 --> 05:00.360
No, that's not going to cut it!
Not this time, man.

05:00.443 --> 05:02.112
- [Cooler] Whoo!
- Whoa.

05:02.195 --> 05:03.196
- Cooler, don't-don't...
- [screeching]

05:06.241 --> 05:09.369
What's up, dudes?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Come on, man.

05:09.452 --> 05:10.912
Wait, man!

05:10.996 --> 05:12.455
Dude...

05:12.538 --> 05:15.375
Why... just... let's...

05:15.458 --> 05:17.752
When you think about it, guys, like...

05:17.836 --> 05:23.549
The world right now, dude,
it's just not going to be able to, like...

05:23.633 --> 05:28.138
Look around! I mean, Venice is different,
and you dudes are the same.

05:28.221 --> 05:30.974
So, be dudes.
Like, we're all dudes here.

05:31.057 --> 05:34.019
- Well put, Cooler.
- Thank you, man.

05:34.102 --> 05:36.855
Like, you can't let a friendship die

05:36.938 --> 05:40.859
just because
of some random, like, hot

05:40.942 --> 05:42.777
and really intellectually...

05:42.861 --> 05:47.157
Her legs are amazing,
but, like, you can't...

05:47.240 --> 05:50.952
That's too cliché
even for you two assjobs.

05:54.706 --> 05:55.707
Who initiated?

05:57.667 --> 06:00.128
- What?
- Did you kiss her or did she kiss you?

06:02.339 --> 06:04.007
- I don't know, man.
- You were there, man.

06:04.090 --> 06:08.094
Somebody made the first move.
Was it you or her?

06:10.013 --> 06:11.472
- It was a tie.
- [groans]

06:11.556 --> 06:14.517
See, that's what I'm talking about.
You can't even give me a straight answer.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.687
It was a tie, man.
That's the truth. It is!

06:17.770 --> 06:20.232
But I'm not going to lie to you.
I wanted to do it. In the moment, I did,

06:20.315 --> 06:22.317
but the second I did it,
I knew it was wrong

06:22.401 --> 06:24.444
and I came straight to you.

06:24.527 --> 06:29.741
I didn't have to, but... I had to,
you know? I value our friendship.

06:29.824 --> 06:32.869
Yeah, well, friendship's supposed to be
50/50. Lately, it's more like 90/10.

06:32.952 --> 06:34.954
Would you take 60/40 maybe?

06:35.038 --> 06:37.916
- Not now, Cooler.
- Cooler, shut the fuck up.

06:38.875 --> 06:40.752
- I didn't know that you felt that way.
- [scoffs]

06:40.835 --> 06:42.754
Yeah, well, I do.

06:42.837 --> 06:45.882
You know what?
Lately, I feel a lot like I'm your...

06:45.965 --> 06:47.175
- Wife?
- Cooler!

06:47.259 --> 06:48.885
- What the fuck? No, Cooler!
- Shut the fuck up.

06:48.968 --> 06:50.178
Shut the fuck up.

06:50.262 --> 06:53.181
You know, you wanted London from
the very first moment I laid eyes on her,

06:53.265 --> 06:54.307
and not only that,

06:54.391 --> 06:57.060
you wanted me to absolve you
of your guilt for going after her.

06:57.143 --> 06:59.562
- Dennis, look...
- No, man, you can't deny that.

06:59.645 --> 07:02.648
There's no other way to interpret it.

07:02.732 --> 07:04.484
- I guess I just...
- What?

07:04.567 --> 07:05.818
Nothing.

07:06.861 --> 07:07.862
That's it.

07:10.156 --> 07:11.157
I fucked up.

07:14.953 --> 07:16.662
You are my friend.

07:16.746 --> 07:17.997
I don't know, man.

07:27.173 --> 07:32.304
We can just rally if you're...
too sad to play a full game.

07:32.387 --> 07:35.390
[rock music playing]

07:48.569 --> 07:50.155
[machine timer buzzing]

07:57.829 --> 07:59.289
Oh, Jesus!

08:00.665 --> 08:03.335
- What the fuck did you put in this?
- Yeah, man.

08:03.418 --> 08:05.003
<i>Jesús... </i> [speaking Spanish]

08:05.920 --> 08:06.921
Where's Miguel?

08:07.464 --> 08:09.590
- [speaking Spanish]
- <i>¿Por qué?</i>

08:09.674 --> 08:11.884
<i>Le puso la pistola a su primo.</i>

08:11.968 --> 08:15.388
Sounds like he got locked up for pulling
a pistol on one of his homies. A cousin.

08:15.472 --> 08:18.391
We need to talk to this cousin,
see if we can get these charges dropped.

08:18.475 --> 08:19.559
Yeah.

08:22.521 --> 08:25.148
[speaking Spanish]

08:37.034 --> 08:39.578
- [door closes]
- [engine starts and revs]

08:46.794 --> 08:47.879
Whoa.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.590
So, the stuff in here
is, like, super expensive, huh?

08:50.673 --> 08:53.926
Yeah, yeah. Some of it is.

08:54.010 --> 08:57.722
You got a bottle of that stuff in there,
go for a thousand bucks easy.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.807
Fuck. Well, don't give that shit to Uno.
He's an asshole.

08:59.891 --> 09:04.145
No, I wouldn't. It's not going anywhere.
It's got a lot of sentimental value.

09:04.229 --> 09:06.189
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

09:06.272 --> 09:08.525
What was her name?

09:08.608 --> 09:10.693
- Celeste.
- Celeste.

09:10.776 --> 09:12.487
She sounds hot.

09:12.571 --> 09:15.532
Yeah, yeah.
No, that... that wasn't the problem.

09:20.579 --> 09:22.622
Thanks.

09:22.705 --> 09:26.251
- I owe you big time for this, Dennis.
- Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah. Happy to do it.

09:26.334 --> 09:28.878
I mean, I don't know how or when
I'm going to be able to pay you back...

09:28.961 --> 09:32.507
No, no, no. Don't sweat it.
Seriously, I'm glad I could be of service.

09:32.591 --> 09:34.926
Chip would have never taken
the time to do this.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.929
Yeah, well, Chip's a complicated guy.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.722
You don't have to stick up
for him, Dennis.

09:39.805 --> 09:41.641
I know. I'm not.

09:44.310 --> 09:46.605
So, the other night, we had a fight.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.565
What happened?
Did you guys break up?

09:48.648 --> 09:52.277
We got into it.
It got ugly, I guess,

09:52.360 --> 09:54.195
but we... we talked it out just now,

09:54.279 --> 09:57.907
and I said what I needed to say
and I was very direct.

09:57.990 --> 10:00.660
Yeah, well, how did he lie himself
out of that one?

10:00.743 --> 10:03.746
Well, to his credit, he didn't.

10:03.913 --> 10:07.917
Bastard actually copped to it.
After I was done laying into him,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.296
he just stood there
and said that he was sorry,

10:11.379 --> 10:13.465
like a little kid.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.884
I kind of felt like a dick.

10:16.968 --> 10:20.138
Yeah, well, no one says sorry
better than a drunk.

10:20.221 --> 10:21.931
They get so much practice, I guess.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.183
Yeah.

10:24.267 --> 10:25.851
[water running]

10:27.812 --> 10:28.896
[knocks on door]

10:32.484 --> 10:33.859
Hey, man.

10:35.820 --> 10:38.615
Hey, uh, I just wanted to say
that I'm really sorry

10:38.698 --> 10:42.577
that, like, you and Dennis didn't...
it didn't work out so well today.

10:42.661 --> 10:43.953
- Yeah. Me, too. Me, too.
- Yeah.

10:44.036 --> 10:47.582
I mean, it's a shame
that it didn't happen like "today" today.

10:47.666 --> 10:50.543
- You want me out of here?
- It's... dude, not like that.

10:50.627 --> 10:53.421
It's just that I have people
coming over from Save Venice

10:53.505 --> 10:56.966
because I accidentally volunteered
this place as, like, headquarters.

10:57.049 --> 10:59.802
Otherwise, they'd be
at Spikey's fucking Winnebago

10:59.885 --> 11:01.721
and he falls asleep early.

11:01.804 --> 11:03.806
- It's...
- You know what? Can I... can we just...

11:03.889 --> 11:06.392
- Do you mind? You know, out there.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

11:08.311 --> 11:09.937
Listen, man, um...

11:11.189 --> 11:18.029
[sighs] If it's space that you need,
uh, you're free to use my store.

11:18.988 --> 11:21.741
- Oh, shit. Really?
- Yeah, man.

11:21.824 --> 11:25.620
- That's... fucking awesome, man. Thanks.
- Yeah, of course. No problem, man.

11:25.704 --> 11:26.746
- Wow.
- Okay?

11:26.829 --> 11:27.997
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.666
I'm just going to...
I've got to use the...

11:29.749 --> 11:30.750
Yeah.

11:33.961 --> 11:34.795
[urinating]

11:34.879 --> 11:40.092
You know, I've got to say, dude,
that... that your kind offer

11:40.176 --> 11:45.014
is now going to seem a little bit
like I am ungrateful with this next part,

11:45.097 --> 11:48.601
but please be advised that I already
thought about what I'm going to say.

11:48.685 --> 11:49.728
Right.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.522
It's just... it's been really cool
having you crash on my couch.

11:52.605 --> 11:54.982
Dude, do not mention it.
It's been helping me out too, so...

11:55.066 --> 12:00.530
Awesome. Well, cool.
Um, but, uh, I have bills to pay.

12:00.613 --> 12:06.578
- You want me to pay rent?
- No, no. God, no. Whoa. Absolutely not.

12:06.661 --> 12:08.829
Just, like, incidentals,
like toilet paper

12:08.913 --> 12:11.499
or remote control batteries
or, like, food, man.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.793
Oh, dude. Food. Come on,
you know that I'd never eat here.

12:13.876 --> 12:15.795
I know, but, um...

12:17.296 --> 12:19.465
the watermelon...

12:19.549 --> 12:20.592
Watermelon?

12:20.675 --> 12:21.967
Yeah.

12:25.638 --> 12:28.641
That, man.
That cost three bucks, Chip.

12:28.725 --> 12:30.142
Is that the watermelon
that was in your fridge?

12:30.226 --> 12:34.105
- Yeah, and it's gone!
- Yeah... because you ate it.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.649
- No, I didn't.
- You woke me up.

12:36.733 --> 12:41.404
No. No, I would remember
if I ate a watermelon, Chip.

12:41.487 --> 12:43.364
It was the middle of the night,
and there you were,

12:43.448 --> 12:45.658
and you were beard deep in watermelon.

12:45.742 --> 12:47.827
No, there's no way, dude.

12:47.910 --> 12:50.663
You don't remember
because you were so high.

12:50.747 --> 12:53.541
You kept saying over and over again,
"I am so high right now."

12:53.625 --> 12:55.918
- I sleep-ate a whole watermelon?
- Yeah.

12:56.001 --> 12:58.504
And then, you polished off
what was left in Chong's bowl.

12:58.588 --> 13:00.256
And then, you were saying,
"I can't believe that nobody's thought

13:00.339 --> 13:01.758
of putting these two foods together."

13:01.841 --> 13:04.677
- That together they constitute...
- A super food delicacy!

13:04.761 --> 13:06.345
Yeah, man. That is me!

13:06.429 --> 13:09.890
Bro, that is me, dude. Yeah.

13:09.974 --> 13:12.268
Your story checks out.

13:14.270 --> 13:16.564
- You're a good friend to me, man.
- Okay.

13:16.648 --> 13:18.316
[machine hissing]

13:19.484 --> 13:20.652
Whoa.

13:21.944 --> 13:23.904
You really knocked the shit
out of this thing, huh?

13:23.988 --> 13:28.117
That's not the one I hit.
This one.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.285
Oh.

13:30.495 --> 13:34.457
Look, this one's actually called "Dent."
It seems like he should be paying you.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.208
- [scoffs] Yeah.
- [man] Dennis.

13:37.376 --> 13:39.796
- Yeah.
- [chuckling]

13:39.879 --> 13:43.132
- Dennis Robinson.
- Yeah, that's me.

13:44.676 --> 13:46.135
It's me, man.

13:47.136 --> 13:48.888
Chris Flanders.

13:48.971 --> 13:52.475
Oh, Flanders! Hey! Shit.
Yeah, I thought that was you,

13:52.558 --> 13:55.144
but with the mask...

13:55.227 --> 13:57.647
So, you're "Uno" now?

13:57.730 --> 14:00.024
- One and only.
- Right.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.777
Yeah, Chris... uh, Uno and I went
to high school together.

14:02.861 --> 14:05.655
[Uno] Good times, man.

14:05.738 --> 14:07.239
How's Jackie?

14:08.240 --> 14:10.117
She's good, man.

14:10.201 --> 14:13.204
- [Uno] Wow. [Chuckles]
- [mouthing words]

14:18.292 --> 14:23.088
- So, you're here to say you're sorry.
- Yeah. I'm... I'm really sorry.

14:23.172 --> 14:25.007
Sorry.

14:25.090 --> 14:28.887
Yeah, we thought that this might help
soften the blow, you know?

14:28.969 --> 14:30.847
To the art world.

14:40.481 --> 14:41.482
Apology accepted.

14:42.901 --> 14:48.406
That's the spiritual damage taken care of,
but, unfortunately, I'm an artist.

14:49.824 --> 14:53.828
And commerce is what
allows me to do what I do.

14:53.912 --> 14:57.331
Okay. How much for the commerce side?

14:59.250 --> 15:01.293
- A thousand bucks.
- What?

15:01.377 --> 15:03.796
Wha...? A grand for that?

15:03.880 --> 15:06.215
- It's ruined.
- Is it?

15:09.677 --> 15:13.097
- It's not supposed to sway.
- I don't have a thousand dollars.

15:13.180 --> 15:17.852
Hey, look, Chri... Uno. You got the wine.
That's five hundred bucks right there.

15:17.936 --> 15:19.061
Yeah.

15:21.898 --> 15:23.065
[grunting]

15:23.148 --> 15:24.817
All right, because it's you.

15:26.402 --> 15:28.487
Shoot me another five bills...

15:29.697 --> 15:31.115
[grunts]

15:31.198 --> 15:32.450
- ...we'll call it quits.
- Great.

15:32.533 --> 15:37.538
- I still don't have five hundred dollars.
- That's okay. Thanks, Uno. That's okay.

15:37.622 --> 15:41.166
- What an asshole. Five hundred bucks?
- Yeah, that guy sucks.

15:41.250 --> 15:45.045
Ew. How long do you think
his hand was in that glove?

15:45.129 --> 15:47.006
About a month.

15:47.089 --> 15:50.175
Might have to break into your cellar
to get a bottle of that expensive wine.

15:50.259 --> 15:51.302
Yeah.

15:51.385 --> 15:55.139
You know what? It could've been worse.
Good thing you remembered who he was.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.432
I didn't.

15:57.892 --> 15:59.184
[Dennis chuckles]

16:01.145 --> 16:03.773
I have... I've got, like,
a double shift today.

16:06.191 --> 16:08.068
See you later.

16:08.152 --> 16:10.655
Belly of the beast, huh?

16:10.738 --> 16:13.783
Actually, it's <i>guanciale. </i> Pig's jowl.

16:13.866 --> 16:15.200
Right.

16:16.368 --> 16:17.536
Um...

16:17.620 --> 16:20.456
- Hey, listen, have you got a second?
- Yeah, sure.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.125
Um...

16:25.544 --> 16:30.299
So, look, I don't know
what the protocol is here, um...

16:30.382 --> 16:32.426
but, um...

16:32.510 --> 16:35.346
and you can definitely say no
if... if you want to...

16:35.429 --> 16:37.306
What's the question?

16:37.389 --> 16:39.976
Well, it's more of a request
or, like, a favor.

16:40.059 --> 16:42.728
- Just tell me.
- Okay. Um...

16:42.812 --> 16:47.149
Would you be at all interested in...

16:47.232 --> 16:50.862
going on a date
with a friend of mine?

16:52.905 --> 16:53.948
With Dennis?

16:54.032 --> 16:55.741
With Topher.

16:56.617 --> 16:58.744
The super rich kid who was in here.

16:58.828 --> 17:01.205
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the other day.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.457
You want me to go on a date with him?

17:03.541 --> 17:06.752
Well, he wants to go
on a date with you, and, um...

17:06.836 --> 17:09.296
And what do you want?

17:10.381 --> 17:11.674
I...

17:12.340 --> 17:14.719
Um, God. You know what? Forget it.
It was a terrible idea.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.179
- He wants to invest in your store?
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

17:17.262 --> 17:19.138
It's... it's... Forget it.

17:19.223 --> 17:21.684
It's okay. I know
that your store's important to you.

17:21.767 --> 17:25.021
Yeah, I know, but it's not...
no, it... I shouldn't have...

17:25.104 --> 17:26.814
I'll do it.

17:26.897 --> 17:29.025
- No, you don't have to.
- It's just a date.

17:31.276 --> 17:33.863
You'd be really helping me out,

17:33.946 --> 17:36.115
and you wouldn't have to do anything
that you don't want to do.

17:36.198 --> 17:38.534
Okay. So, just a hand job?

17:39.410 --> 17:41.079
[both laugh]

17:43.497 --> 17:47.418
Yes, that would be great.
For Topher, not for...

17:48.544 --> 17:50.295
Oh, hey.

17:51.672 --> 17:52.882
Hey, man.

17:53.841 --> 17:55.051
- Kara.
- Chip.

17:55.134 --> 17:56.260
- Hey, Dennis.
- London.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.054
You two know each other, right?

17:58.137 --> 18:00.180
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we met at the, uh, store.

18:00.264 --> 18:02.266
- Yeah, I was looking for the router.
- The router.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.602
Yeah. Right. I remember that.

18:04.685 --> 18:07.229
- Is Sal upstairs?
- [London] Yeah, I think so.

18:07.312 --> 18:09.648
- Yeah?
- Oh, you're here on wine business.

18:09.732 --> 18:13.360
Oh, no. No, actually, uh, Kara needed
to scrape together a little extra cash.

18:13.444 --> 18:17.698
So, I talked to Sal.
He got her some shifts here.

18:18.616 --> 18:19.825
Cool.

18:19.909 --> 18:22.787
- You want me to bring you up?
- Yeah. That'd be great. Thanks.

18:22.870 --> 18:24.413
- Uh, want me to come or...
- No, I can handle it.

18:24.496 --> 18:25.539
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:25.623 --> 18:27.125
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.960
- I'll just wait down here.
- Okay.

18:30.169 --> 18:31.837
I'll wait down here, too.

18:34.715 --> 18:36.258
Nice of you to help Kara out like that.

18:36.341 --> 18:38.844
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [door closing]

18:38.928 --> 18:42.681
And, before you ask,
no, nothing's going on.

18:42.765 --> 18:45.101
I wasn't going to ask.

18:45.184 --> 18:46.852
But in case you were going to ask,

18:46.936 --> 18:48.813
nothing's going on
with me and London either.

18:48.896 --> 18:52.150
- No, I... I really wasn't going to ask.
- Good.

18:53.358 --> 18:55.820
Since no one's asking,
I actually set London up on a date

18:55.903 --> 18:57.321
with my buddy Topher.

18:57.404 --> 19:01.159
Oh, he's your buddy now.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.453
- The super rich tech gazillionaire...
- I didn't know that.

19:04.536 --> 19:08.290
...you just happened to sponsor
right when you needed a cash infusion.

19:08.373 --> 19:11.376
- Hey, honestly, that was news to me, man.
- Huh.

19:11.460 --> 19:15.631
The thing is, I can't even tell
when you're lying anymore.

19:15.714 --> 19:16.799
[door opens]

19:17.591 --> 19:19.510
I don't think you can either.

19:21.053 --> 19:22.304
- How'd it go?
- I'm in.

19:22.387 --> 19:23.472
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:23.555 --> 19:25.141
That's great!
Do you want to get out of here?

19:25.224 --> 19:26.809
- Yeah.
- Good. Um...

19:26.892 --> 19:29.937
Hey, uh... take care of yourself.

19:30.021 --> 19:31.105
Yeah.

19:39.822 --> 19:42.992
- London seems nice.
- Yeah, she is. Very nice.

19:43.075 --> 19:45.703
- Didn't you and...
- No, no, no, we didn't.

19:45.786 --> 19:48.580
- What about Chip?
- Well, he says not.

19:48.664 --> 19:51.750
- So, that's a maybe.
- [chuckles] Yeah, maybe.

19:54.045 --> 19:56.922
Do you know what
Chip told me about you?

19:57.006 --> 19:59.591
That I'm a very gentle lover?

19:59.675 --> 20:01.844
You had a crush on me.

20:02.970 --> 20:05.681
I wish he hadn't said that.

20:05.764 --> 20:10.394
- You never did anything about it.
- Well, I couldn't.

20:10.477 --> 20:15.357
- Because of Chip?
- No, because of you.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.070
- You were still in your first year.
- Not anymore.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.701
[gags and coughs]

20:25.784 --> 20:27.036
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

20:27.119 --> 20:29.247
- Spit it out.
- It's stuck.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.707
- [coughing]
- You okay?

20:32.457 --> 20:34.252
[grunts and exhales]

20:35.460 --> 20:36.837
[sighs]

20:36.921 --> 20:39.715
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

20:39.798 --> 20:40.799
I think so.

20:41.675 --> 20:44.595
Um... yeah, so...

20:49.308 --> 20:52.352
All right, guys. Let me know
if, uh, you need anything else.

20:52.436 --> 20:56.648
- I can, uh, be of...
- Yeah, man, what's the Wi-Fi?

20:56.732 --> 20:59.818
- I don't know. Cooler's got that info.
- Okay. Cooler.

20:59.902 --> 21:02.113
Hey, man.
What's up with the Internet?

21:02.196 --> 21:03.906
Uh...

21:03.989 --> 21:04.990
What?

21:06.951 --> 21:08.368
- [Chip] Hey!
- Brother.

21:08.452 --> 21:10.788
Hey, Toph... er.

21:10.871 --> 21:12.957
What, uh... what's all this?

21:13.040 --> 21:16.668
Oh, um, they're... we're Save Venice.

21:16.752 --> 21:21.006
Kind of like the gatekeepers
of the vibe down here.

21:21.090 --> 21:22.549
[Topher] Cool.

21:22.633 --> 21:25.094
Nice... nice duds.

21:25.177 --> 21:26.304
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.805
- You like these guys?
- Yeah.

21:27.888 --> 21:30.266
Hey, thanks for hooking me up
with London.

21:30.349 --> 21:32.434
I've got to tell you, I'm pretty excited.

21:32.517 --> 21:34.103
I knew you weren't going
to let me down, and...

21:34.186 --> 21:35.771
Happy to do...

21:35.854 --> 21:38.523
Happy to do it. Do you want
to come back here for a second?

21:38.607 --> 21:40.067
Yeah.

21:40.151 --> 21:43.112
- Hey. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

21:43.195 --> 21:45.072
- Sorry about the other night.
- Hey, babe.

21:47.992 --> 21:49.576
[moans and giggles]

21:50.995 --> 21:54.790
- So, you talk to your guy?
- Uh, which guy?

21:54.873 --> 21:56.167
About the store.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.752
Oh, yeah. I just did,
as a matter of fact. Yeah.

22:00.671 --> 22:01.880
And...?

22:01.964 --> 22:04.967
Nothing. It's just...
Oh, he's a funny dude.

22:05.050 --> 22:06.593
Oh, great. Yeah.

22:06.677 --> 22:09.930
- He, uh, he said the price was too high.
- What?

22:10.014 --> 22:13.558
But you came to me.
You said you wanted something real.

22:13.642 --> 22:17.021
And-and you get the building, too.
That's... Your guy is...

22:17.104 --> 22:20.440
- He just didn't think it was worth it.
- Well, what'd you say to him?

22:20.524 --> 22:23.361
I said, "Wait till you see
the chicks down there."

22:23.443 --> 22:26.989
- You told him about the vibe.
- Yeah, a little bit.

22:27.072 --> 22:28.991
More about the chicks, though.

22:29.074 --> 22:33.371
I told him it's a small price to pay
for pussy of that caliber.

22:34.038 --> 22:36.874
[Chip]
Yeah. Look, I'm not sure...

22:39.459 --> 22:42.004
London's not part of the deal.

22:42.087 --> 22:44.798
Oh, I-I know.
[whispers] Not officially.

22:44.882 --> 22:46.675
Yeah.

22:46.758 --> 22:49.387
Not unofficially, either.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.722
- I hear what you're saying.
- I'm not sure you do.

22:51.805 --> 22:54.392
Dude, you dangled her
right in front of my face.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.810
I introduced you to her,
if that's what you mean.

22:56.894 --> 22:58.437
I know what you mean.
You know what I mean.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.147
- We're saying the same thing here.
- No, look, Topher...

23:00.231 --> 23:06.111
Dude, you asked her out on a date for me.
You knew exactly what you were doing.

23:08.822 --> 23:11.533
You did what you had to do
to make the sale.

23:11.616 --> 23:13.827
You just sweetened the pot a little bit.

23:15.913 --> 23:17.581
So, what do you say?

23:17.664 --> 23:18.790
Close the deal?

23:27.716 --> 23:31.053
I think it's time for you
to find a new sponsor.

23:34.681 --> 23:35.807
[stifled chuckle]

23:38.769 --> 23:39.770
Okay.

23:49.113 --> 23:50.364
[door closing]

23:52.699 --> 23:54.659
[engine revving]

24:03.502 --> 24:05.170
Everything okay?

24:07.423 --> 24:09.674
Yeah. No, I just, uh...

24:12.344 --> 24:14.679
Sorry.

24:14.763 --> 24:16.932
Looks like you got
all dressed up for nothing.

24:19.893 --> 24:23.188
Well... here goes nothing.

24:41.499 --> 24:43.041
I'm here to see the man of the house.

24:43.125 --> 24:45.836
- Ah, he's not here.
- Where is he?

24:45.919 --> 24:47.546
- Why don't you call him?
- Hey, hey.

24:47.629 --> 24:49.381
Hey, man. Hold on.

24:50.882 --> 24:53.051
- I thought you said he wasn't here.
- He's not.

24:53.135 --> 24:55.053
Why don't you call
his fucking cell phone?

24:55.137 --> 24:57.639
Chip got a cell phone?
Since when?

24:57.722 --> 25:00.434
Since he found out
that his pigeon lays golden eggs.

25:00.518 --> 25:02.144
Everything okay
between you and Chip?

25:02.227 --> 25:05.605
Sure. Yeah. It's great.
Look, did you want his number?

25:05.689 --> 25:07.858
- Is he drinking?
- "Is he drinking?"

25:08.817 --> 25:12.988
- Do you know if he's been drinking?
- No. Look, I don't know.

25:14.281 --> 25:16.367
It's more about me
cleaning up his messes,

25:16.450 --> 25:19.328
and that seems to be all I'm fucking
doing lately and I'm fucking sick of it.

25:19.411 --> 25:23.415
Oh, yeah. Now, I see. I get it.
No. I get it.

25:23.499 --> 25:25.000
- Thank you.
- No, I do. I do.

25:25.083 --> 25:27.336
I mean, it's not like the guy
ever did anything for you, right?

25:27.419 --> 25:32.132
I mean, he took you, uh...
first time to get detoxed, right?

25:32.216 --> 25:35.553
And then, he brought you
to your first meeting.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.095
And then, if I remember right,

25:37.179 --> 25:40.849
there was that whole stretch
of 90 meetings in 90 days.

25:40.932 --> 25:43.477
Am I right? But, aside from that...

25:44.436 --> 25:46.355
the guy's done fuck all for you,
am I right?

25:46.438 --> 25:48.815
- George, look...
- No, you look, Dennis.

25:48.899 --> 25:51.818
Your boy's out there spiraling out
and you're mad about what?

25:51.902 --> 25:53.862
That he fucked a piece of ass
that you want?

25:53.945 --> 25:56.823
- They just kissed.
- Who gives a shit?

25:56.907 --> 26:00.744
It doesn't matter.
Do you hear me? It does not matter.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.997
The only thing that matters right now
is that you step up to the plate

26:04.122 --> 26:05.832
and that you get over whatever real

26:05.916 --> 26:08.544
or imagined injustices
Chip has committed against you,

26:08.627 --> 26:10.379
and you stick your hand out there,

26:10.462 --> 26:13.632
and you be a friend the same way
that he was to you.

26:13.715 --> 26:16.009
- Do you understand me?
- He doesn't need me, George.

26:17.177 --> 26:18.303
Okay.

26:20.889 --> 26:22.057
Okay.

26:25.018 --> 26:28.355
Chip ever mention to you
about that, uh...

26:28.439 --> 26:30.649
silver Honda that he's seen around?

26:30.732 --> 26:33.902
- Looks like the one in the accident.
- Yeah, he sees those all the time.

26:33.985 --> 26:36.696
Yeah, well...

26:36.780 --> 26:38.407
This one, London drives.

26:40.492 --> 26:42.744
I checked her out.

26:42.827 --> 26:43.870
And?

26:46.415 --> 26:48.166
[sighs]

26:48.250 --> 26:50.210
It was her brother that Chip killed.

26:52.630 --> 26:54.131
Fuck.

26:57.092 --> 26:58.343
Whoa.

27:01.221 --> 27:03.474
I did not see that coming.

27:07.102 --> 27:08.728
You got that number handy?

27:15.068 --> 27:18.071
[rock music playing]

27:20.658 --> 27:22.534
[ringtone chiming]

27:31.751 --> 27:33.420
[chiming continues]

27:33.504 --> 27:35.673
- Do you need to get that?
- [sighs]

27:35.755 --> 27:38.216
I've kind of got my hands full
at the moment.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.888
- [ringtone chiming]
- [groans]

27:45.599 --> 27:47.476
Maybe you should get it.
It could be important.

27:47.559 --> 27:50.646
Considering nobody's got
my number, I doubt it.

27:53.524 --> 27:56.151
See? This is why
I don't have a cell phone.

27:57.986 --> 27:59.988
Hello?

28:00.989 --> 28:03.950
Hey, George. What's going on?

28:10.957 --> 28:12.042
[chuckles softly]

28:13.793 --> 28:14.878
[sighs deeply]

28:37.651 --> 28:38.943
What are you doing?

28:40.362 --> 28:41.196
What?

28:42.406 --> 28:43.699
He was your brother?

28:46.451 --> 28:48.870
- What?
- He was your brother?

28:49.788 --> 28:51.956
When were you going to tell me?

28:56.211 --> 28:59.297
- Were you going to tell me?
- I wanted to.

28:59.381 --> 29:03.218
- But...?
- It never felt like the right time.

29:03.301 --> 29:06.555
Even when I told you about the accident?

29:06.638 --> 29:11.560
- That didn't seem like the right time?
- Chip, I don't know. No, it... No. I...

29:11.643 --> 29:15.355
- It wasn't part of the plan.
- The plan?

29:15.439 --> 29:17.274
- No!
- What was... what was the plan?

29:17.357 --> 29:21.570
No, there was no plan.
There was no plan. I was just confused.

29:23.447 --> 29:26.241
You came here to find me.

29:26.324 --> 29:32.581
I just... I wanted to know how...
I needed to know how you lived with it.

29:32.664 --> 29:38.128
So, you tracked me down?
You got a job at my favorite restaurant.

29:38.211 --> 29:41.339
You got close to my best friend,
and then you rent my studio?

29:41.423 --> 29:42.633
I didn't know that was
your favorite restaurant.

29:42.716 --> 29:45.176
- It's true.
- And then this?

29:45.260 --> 29:47.512
- Was this part of the plan?
- No.

29:48.680 --> 29:49.931
This just happened.

29:53.518 --> 29:55.687
No, it didn't.

29:57.648 --> 30:00.108
[rock music playing]

30:39.105 --> 30:42.108
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

30:54.037 --> 30:58.041
