00:01.577 --> 00:04.359
Grover, I'm telling you, you
are gonna love camping.

00:04.627 --> 00:07.799
There's hiking, there's
a nature center,

00:07.824 --> 00:09.693
there's even a waterfall.

00:09.727 --> 00:13.330
I don't know, feels like you
guys are selling it pretty hard.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.594
Hey, guys, whats going on here?

00:16.619 --> 00:18.227
Were just getting our gear ready.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.067
The Johnsons are going camping.

00:20.306 --> 00:21.723
Permanently?

00:22.700 --> 00:24.065
I wish.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.323
Were just going for the weekend.

00:26.348 --> 00:27.985
Its Grovers first time.

00:28.010 --> 00:30.315
Wait, were doing this more than once?

00:30.906 --> 00:33.453
Buddy, it is gonna be fantastic.

00:33.478 --> 00:35.793
There is nothing like being outside,

00:35.818 --> 00:39.425
just you and the elements,
sleeping under the open sky.

00:39.528 --> 00:41.671
Yeah, that's exactly what
Crackhead Victor said

00:41.696 --> 00:45.211
when he tried to sell his house
to pay for... Well, you know.

00:47.553 --> 00:49.680
So I take it you guys
aren't big campers?

00:49.705 --> 00:51.994
Are you kidding? The
only camping he ever did

00:52.019 --> 00:54.800
was standing in line for tickets
to see Earth, Wind & Fire.

00:55.614 --> 00:57.091
I prefer the kind of elements

00:57.116 --> 00:58.503
- you can groove to.
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.

00:58.528 --> 00:59.862
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute,

00:59.887 --> 01:01.260
Wait a minute now, get it, baby.

01:01.285 --> 01:03.016
Get it. Hey.

01:04.004 --> 01:05.428
You should come with us.

01:05.453 --> 01:07.172
Everybody pitching in,
no distractions...

01:07.648 --> 01:09.611
Camping really brings
a family together.

01:09.966 --> 01:12.890
Dave, I got one grown
son who lives with us,

01:12.915 --> 01:14.795
and another who's over all the time.

01:14.820 --> 01:17.825
Trust me, togetherness
is not my problem.

01:19.403 --> 01:20.899
Well, you don't know
what you're missing.

01:20.924 --> 01:23.170
Yeah, I do. A roof.

01:27.648 --> 01:30.367

01:30.367 --> 01:32.632
Hey. You guys were gone for a while.

01:32.657 --> 01:34.359
Yeah, that must've been a good walk.

01:34.393 --> 01:36.305
We only walked two blocks.

01:36.982 --> 01:38.723
Your father stopped to yell
at one kid for cursing,

01:38.748 --> 01:41.022
then cursed at another kid for yelling.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.310
So like you said, good walk.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.598
Get up.

01:47.537 --> 01:48.503
Move over.

01:48.528 --> 01:49.820
Man.

01:51.354 --> 01:53.930
You know what, baby, I think we
should take Dave and Gemma up

01:53.955 --> 01:55.539
on their offer and go camping.

01:55.564 --> 01:59.548
What? Your mom thinks we
should all go camping.

01:59.965 --> 02:01.614
- I'm in.
- Sounds like fun to me.

02:01.651 --> 02:03.129
Who asked you?

02:04.227 --> 02:06.001
I think it might be fun.

02:06.131 --> 02:07.275
You know my New Years Resolution

02:07.300 --> 02:09.437
was to try more white people stuff.

02:11.146 --> 02:13.686
Uh, you already made quinoa
and watched <i>The Crown.</i>

02:13.711 --> 02:15.024
Isn't that enough?

02:15.598 --> 02:17.565
Baby, we have not been
on a family vacation

02:17.590 --> 02:18.792
together in years.

02:18.817 --> 02:20.430
Yeah, and we've never been camping.

02:20.455 --> 02:22.293
- It always looks fun in the movies.
- Yeah.

02:22.318 --> 02:24.329
Yeah, until the axe murderer shows up.

02:24.354 --> 02:27.420
You know the black people are
always the first ones to die.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.493
Come on, Calvin.

02:31.864 --> 02:35.162
You and I could sneak off on
a hike, just the two of us,

02:35.633 --> 02:37.447
get in touch with nature.

02:37.812 --> 02:40.582
Oh, kind of like that flower bed

02:40.607 --> 02:42.248
after the Earth, Wind
& Fire concert, ah...

02:43.498 --> 02:45.016
You remember that.

02:46.132 --> 02:48.301
This is grosser than Moms quinoa.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.140
You should hear how they talk
when they think I'm not home.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.405
Oh, we know you at home.

03:00.659 --> 03:02.508
Smell that fresh air.

03:02.776 --> 03:05.627
Are we there yet?

03:05.652 --> 03:07.896
We've been hiking forever.

03:08.415 --> 03:11.466
Grover, we've... we've
walked a hundred yards.

03:12.780 --> 03:15.130
You can still see the car from here.

03:15.843 --> 03:18.745
Well, were here now. Lets set up camp.

03:19.036 --> 03:20.974
I have to pee. Wheres the bathroom?

03:20.999 --> 03:23.735
Ooh, son, get ready to
have your mind blown.

03:24.391 --> 03:26.878
Its wherever you want it to be.

03:27.183 --> 03:28.289
Cool.

03:28.314 --> 03:29.897
Whoa! Okay...

03:30.230 --> 03:32.462
Take it to the bushes, Quick Draw.

03:34.318 --> 03:36.214
I wonder when the Butlers
are gonna get here.

03:36.239 --> 03:38.608
Tina said they had to stop on
the way and pick up supplies.

03:38.845 --> 03:40.115
I cant wait. You know, I think

03:40.140 --> 03:41.769
Calvins really gonna like camping.

03:41.794 --> 03:43.295
And good for him for
being willing to get out

03:43.320 --> 03:45.259
of his comfort zone
and rough it with us.

03:52.419 --> 03:56.330
Hey, Johnsons! Let the
roughing it begin!

04:00.399 --> 04:03.907
This is so cool!

04:06.936 --> 04:08.391
Hey, Gemma.

04:09.063 --> 04:10.523
You want some sushi?

04:10.692 --> 04:12.293
We didn't have any fishing poles,

04:12.318 --> 04:14.549
so I figured wed just
skip to the good part.

04:15.702 --> 04:17.728
Ooh, look at that. Caught
a California roll.

04:21.075 --> 04:24.026
Oh, wow. Look at this place.

04:24.051 --> 04:25.961
Yeah, its beautiful, isn't it?

04:26.036 --> 04:29.213
Yeah, its quiet, its remote,

04:29.543 --> 04:32.315
its peaceful.

04:32.625 --> 04:34.956
Is what Dad said about that axe
murderer in your head, too?

04:34.981 --> 04:36.250
Totally.

04:36.595 --> 04:37.642
Hey, guys.

04:43.965 --> 04:45.435
Ha, ha, ha.

04:45.460 --> 04:46.676
What do you say, Dave?

04:46.701 --> 04:47.959
How do you like my tent?

04:48.248 --> 04:50.229
Gets 12 miles to the gallon.

04:51.371 --> 04:53.772
I cant believe you rented an RV.

04:53.982 --> 04:56.031
Rented?

04:56.056 --> 04:58.097
Man, I borrowed this
from my buddy Arthur.

04:58.174 --> 04:59.505
Yeah, hes been staying in it

04:59.530 --> 05:01.344
since he got caught
cheating on his wife.

05:01.437 --> 05:03.703
Lucky for him, she fell down the stairs

05:03.728 --> 05:06.343
and he had to move back
in to take care of her.

05:07.524 --> 05:08.960
How is that lucky for him?

05:09.238 --> 05:11.439
You're right. Lucky for me.

05:16.724 --> 05:18.197
Dad, I'm kind of hungry.

05:18.222 --> 05:20.508
Cool, great. Lets eat.

05:20.533 --> 05:23.276
Now, all we have to do is
collect a bunch of wood

05:23.301 --> 05:25.030
and kindling to start a fire.

05:25.055 --> 05:26.423
Once we get that going, well hike

05:26.448 --> 05:28.542
about a quarter mile down to the well,

05:28.567 --> 05:31.308
bring back some water, and boil it...
which, at this altitude,

05:31.333 --> 05:33.883
should take about 45
minutes to an hour.

05:35.266 --> 05:36.936
Sounds like a lot of work.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.716
Ooh, its a ton.

05:40.219 --> 05:42.188
But that's whats so
great about camping.

05:42.213 --> 05:44.693
Trust me, later tonight,
when you're eating a smore

05:44.718 --> 05:47.271
cooked over a fire that
you built yourself,

05:47.296 --> 05:49.903
it is gonna be the best
thing that you ever tasted.

05:51.540 --> 05:54.268
This smore is the best
thing I've ever tasted.

05:56.124 --> 05:57.957
How'd you make that so fast?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.670
Oh, there's a microwave in there.

05:59.889 --> 06:01.475
I could make you one.

06:01.916 --> 06:03.118
Can I?

06:03.730 --> 06:06.082
Well, its up to you, buddy.

06:06.107 --> 06:07.485
You can do it the easy
way, or you can...

06:07.510 --> 06:08.743
Bye.

06:10.595 --> 06:12.546
You know, Dave, you're
more than welcome.

06:12.676 --> 06:15.140
Were just about to watch <i>Man vs.
Wild</i> in there.

06:15.165 --> 06:17.357
Spoiler alert: man wins.

06:19.299 --> 06:20.469
Mmm.

06:22.502 --> 06:24.806
You know, its... its
kind of nice out here.

06:25.072 --> 06:27.097
Its peaceful and quiet.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.108
You can really hear yourself think.

06:29.326 --> 06:30.621
What are you thinking about?

06:30.668 --> 06:33.164
I'm thinking if this
camping thing goes well,

06:33.189 --> 06:35.875
the next white person thing I
might do is try mayonnaise.

06:37.932 --> 06:39.813
Trust me, its gonna go great.

06:39.838 --> 06:42.121
I've loved camping since
I was a little kid.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.120
Was it big out there in Kalamazoo?

06:44.145 --> 06:45.913
Oh, I'm not from Kalamazoo.

06:45.938 --> 06:48.439
I'm not some big town city slicker.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.071
I'm from Hickory Corners.

06:52.244 --> 06:55.208
Well, I'm from Compton, and you
cant stand on those corners.

06:57.357 --> 06:59.195
So whats it like there?

07:00.049 --> 07:02.210
Oh, just like every other small town.

07:02.235 --> 07:05.364
One stoplight, a Dairy
Queen up by the highway

07:05.389 --> 07:08.191
with a broken soft serve
and some guy named Billy

07:08.216 --> 07:09.950
who cant stay out of trouble.

07:10.289 --> 07:13.152
But his dads the sheriff, so
he gets away with murder.

07:13.974 --> 07:16.110
Mm. In my neighborhood,
that was Little D.

07:16.316 --> 07:18.013
His father was the sheriff?

07:18.386 --> 07:20.253
Yeah, lets go with that.

07:26.910 --> 07:29.441
? Paul Bunyan, Paul Bunyan ?

07:29.636 --> 07:34.836
? Lumberjack explorer of
the western plains... ?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.872
On the shores of Michigan,
his story begins...

07:44.897 --> 07:47.108
He has been singing this
song for ten minutes

07:47.133 --> 07:48.885
and this is where the story begins?

07:49.109 --> 07:50.678
Yeah, we out.

07:50.703 --> 07:54.180
Oh, yeah, thanks, guys. This was a lot.

07:54.205 --> 07:55.374
Well... A lot of what?

07:55.540 --> 07:56.772
Just a lot.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.980
Well, hold on, guys,
we haven't even gotten

07:59.005 --> 08:00.024
to ghost stories yet.

08:00.049 --> 08:01.875
Whoa, did he say ghost stories?

08:02.138 --> 08:03.577
He sure did.

08:04.444 --> 08:07.410
Legend has it that this campsite

08:07.435 --> 08:12.026
was built on the cursed remains
of a Native American graveyard.

08:12.065 --> 08:13.769
- Mama!
- Nope.

08:17.015 --> 08:19.463
Well, looks like its just the Johnsons.

08:19.488 --> 08:21.645
Actually, I have to use the bathroom.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.418
I'm gonna go pee off
that giant cliff again.

08:23.443 --> 08:27.089
W-Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Hey.
Lets just go in the RV.

08:27.114 --> 08:28.748
What? No, don't go in the RV.

08:28.773 --> 08:30.297
I don't want him falling off a cliff.

08:30.322 --> 08:31.788
Well, hell be fine.

08:31.813 --> 08:34.059
There's a river at the bottom of it.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.841
This is gonna taste so much
better than from a microwave.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.823
Ooh. Ooh, baby.

08:47.024 --> 08:48.750
All right... whoa.

08:49.470 --> 08:51.883
Oh... hot! Hot! Hot!

08:51.908 --> 08:53.325
Hot!

08:54.805 --> 08:55.999
Still better.

08:58.197 --> 09:00.952
? Get down, get down,
get down, get down... ?

09:01.137 --> 09:03.618
Arthur may be a cheating
dog of a husband,

09:03.643 --> 09:05.999
but he sure knows how
to trick out an RV!

09:06.198 --> 09:07.511
Hey!

09:08.369 --> 09:10.554
Get it, baby, get it, baby.

09:10.579 --> 09:12.438
Ah, got that...

09:16.325 --> 09:17.568
Hey.

09:17.593 --> 09:18.792
You've been gone a half hour.

09:18.817 --> 09:20.308
I thought you were just taking
Grover to the bathroom.

09:20.466 --> 09:22.625
I was, but then they
started playing music

09:22.650 --> 09:24.257
and Marty challenged
me to a dance battle,

09:24.282 --> 09:27.190
so... I had to represent.

09:29.173 --> 09:31.804
This isn't what I wanted
this weekend to be like.

09:32.277 --> 09:35.666
This RV defeats the entire
purpose of being out here.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.153
Isn't the entire purpose
of being out here

09:38.178 --> 09:40.878
to get closer to each
other and have fun?

09:41.212 --> 09:43.982
I guess, I just... were
supposed to be roughing it,

09:44.075 --> 09:46.830
not living in a mansion on wheels.

09:49.305 --> 09:50.630
Whoa.

09:51.935 --> 09:53.879
Did I do that?

09:55.722 --> 09:56.817
Oh, my God,

09:56.842 --> 10:00.162
- that smell!
- Oh, somebody punch me in the nose!

10:00.431 --> 10:02.152
What-what happened?

10:02.183 --> 10:05.539
The sink started erupting and
then everything went black.

10:05.568 --> 10:07.971
Yeah, we must've overloaded the power,

10:08.097 --> 10:10.134
and it caused the septic pump to blow.

10:10.321 --> 10:12.536
Well, who would've known
borrowing a used RV

10:12.561 --> 10:15.863
from an unemployed
divorcé was a bad idea?

10:16.867 --> 10:18.445
Hey, well, if we cant go back in there,

10:18.470 --> 10:20.048
where are we supposed to sleep?

10:20.697 --> 10:22.257
I've been waiting for you.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:33.295 --> 10:35.059
Oh, God.

10:38.011 --> 10:39.607
Oh, man.

10:50.989 --> 10:52.559
Well, that was a cozy night.

10:52.975 --> 10:55.649
Uh, baby, you got something
stuck to your forehead.

10:56.082 --> 10:57.347
Oh!

10:57.372 --> 10:59.850
Sorry, uh, its my mouthguard.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.785
I'm a grinder.

11:02.934 --> 11:04.297
That was your teeth?

11:04.422 --> 11:07.079
I thought it was an axe
murderer circling our tent.

11:08.302 --> 11:10.519
Is that why you had
your arms around me?

11:10.750 --> 11:12.490
I didn't have my arms around you.

11:20.294 --> 11:22.887
Sorry, uh, thought you were Gemma.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.807
Well, I don't know about anyone else,

11:25.832 --> 11:27.355
but I need a cup of coffee.

11:27.380 --> 11:29.149
- Yes.
- Great.

11:29.239 --> 11:31.553
All we got to do is collect
some wood and kindling...

11:35.158 --> 11:37.398
There's a general store
by the park entrance.

11:37.423 --> 11:39.053
We can just walk over there
and get some coffees

11:39.078 --> 11:40.457
and some cleaning supplies.

11:40.603 --> 11:42.263
Yeah, Ill see if I can
get the RV started,

11:42.288 --> 11:43.838
so we can get out of here.

11:43.863 --> 11:45.089
Well, hold on, g-get out of here?

11:45.114 --> 11:46.931
We haven't even hiked
to the waterfall yet.

11:47.244 --> 11:48.475
Well, its a good thing,

11:48.500 --> 11:50.473
because I wasn't gonna do that anyway.

11:52.197 --> 11:55.093
I think after last night we
all just want to go home.

11:55.118 --> 11:57.543
Really? Even you, buddy?

11:57.771 --> 12:02.005
Sorry, Dad, without the RV,
camping's kind of boring.

12:02.435 --> 12:04.989
Well, what about peeing outside?

12:05.107 --> 12:06.216
Its just not as much fun

12:06.241 --> 12:08.694
when you're allowed to do it.

12:10.378 --> 12:12.390
I know, right?

12:13.794 --> 12:16.166
Fine. You guys go ahead.

12:16.191 --> 12:18.223
I guess Ill stay here
and start packing.

12:18.248 --> 12:20.967
Well be surrounded by noise and traffic

12:20.992 --> 12:22.811
and polluted air in no time.

12:22.836 --> 12:24.489
- Finally. Yes. Good.
- Thank God.

12:24.514 --> 12:26.848
Yes. Come on, baby, come on.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.694
Hey, Dave.

12:28.719 --> 12:31.334
Before I get started, is
there anything around here

12:31.359 --> 12:35.609
for breakfast that doesn't start
with "all you got to do is..."?

12:37.827 --> 12:39.451
Yeah, there's some granola bars

12:39.476 --> 12:40.793
in the bear canister.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.412
- The what?
- The container.

12:43.437 --> 12:44.569
You put your food in there

12:44.594 --> 12:46.852
so you don't attract
bears or other wildlife.

12:47.382 --> 12:48.756
You're trying to tell me

12:48.781 --> 12:50.407
a bear cant get into this thing?

12:50.432 --> 12:52.871
Not if its locked. They're
not clever enough.

12:55.924 --> 12:58.105
All right.

13:14.620 --> 13:17.347
Well, your hats stupid.

13:21.464 --> 13:24.193
It feels good to be indoors again.

13:24.218 --> 13:25.896
Yeah, I like trees a lot better

13:25.921 --> 13:28.559
when they're chopped down
and used to hold up a roof.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.161
Look, there's a nature center.

13:32.748 --> 13:34.106
Oh.

13:34.131 --> 13:36.905
Cool, I always enjoy a
good science exhibit.

13:47.662 --> 13:50.928
Or a macabre temple of death!

13:52.571 --> 13:54.090
Can we...

13:54.115 --> 13:55.476
Leave? Yes.

13:56.422 --> 13:58.240
Uh, we gonna wait outside.

13:58.265 --> 14:00.725
Yeah, take our chances
with the axe murderer.

14:03.388 --> 14:04.691
Morning, ladies.

14:04.716 --> 14:05.899
Good morning, Maynard.

14:05.924 --> 14:07.597
Uh, look, I have to warn you,

14:07.622 --> 14:08.939
if you're here to buy alcohol,

14:08.964 --> 14:11.006
I am gonna need to see some IDs.

14:12.708 --> 14:14.279
Yeah, whatever you got,

14:14.304 --> 14:16.693
- just put a shot of it in my coffee.
- I'm sorry.

14:16.718 --> 14:18.215
I was just joking.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.643
The park actually doesn't
allow me to sell alcohol.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.777
Oh, she was just joking, too.

14:22.831 --> 14:23.943
No, I wasn't.

14:25.338 --> 14:27.357
Well, it looks like you guys
must have quite a mess, huh?

14:27.382 --> 14:27.990
Yeah.

14:28.015 --> 14:30.170
Yeah, the septic tank in our RV blew up

14:30.195 --> 14:32.181
Right in the middle of our dance party.

14:32.206 --> 14:34.473
Good thing the song was telling
us to "slide to the left."

14:34.498 --> 14:36.480
Well, that sounds awful,

14:36.505 --> 14:38.006
But I see it more than you would think.

14:38.031 --> 14:39.529
Luckily for you...

14:40.113 --> 14:41.964
I have one mop left.

14:41.989 --> 14:43.497
Yes, yes! Thank you.

14:43.522 --> 14:45.420
- That's exactly what we needed.
- Ah, you're welcome.

14:45.445 --> 14:48.633
Coffees two dollars,
cleaning supplies, ten,

14:48.658 --> 14:50.509
and a mop, $100 even.

14:50.534 --> 14:52.367
What!?

14:52.964 --> 14:55.626
You're trying to charge
us $100 for a mop?

14:55.651 --> 14:57.191
Well, you're welcome to go to Target;

14:57.216 --> 14:58.335
probably is a lot cheaper.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.730
Oh, great, where is it?

14:59.755 --> 15:01.289
Well, uh, just take a
left at the highway

15:01.314 --> 15:03.194
and then go straight for 30 miles.

15:04.376 --> 15:07.422
Hopefully that bridge is open.

15:09.396 --> 15:11.201
Ah!

15:12.079 --> 15:15.009
This is the last time I listen
to you over Crackhead Victor.

15:16.784 --> 15:18.179
You know,

15:18.525 --> 15:21.025
you didn't even give
camping a chance, Calvin.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.536
You could've had fun.

15:22.665 --> 15:25.842
Fun... Oh, you want fun?

15:25.867 --> 15:27.650
Ill show you fun.

15:29.335 --> 15:31.430
Very funny, Calvin.

15:31.762 --> 15:33.215
Who's Calvin?

15:33.240 --> 15:36.519
I'm a bear, and I'm hungry for Dave!

15:38.088 --> 15:39.635
Now you're just being ridiculous.

15:39.660 --> 15:41.590
A bear would never know my name.

15:46.457 --> 15:48.813
D-D-D...

15:48.892 --> 15:51.211
Dave, Dave, its-its-its a real bear.

15:51.697 --> 15:53.721
Give it up, Calvin. Come on.

15:57.047 --> 16:00.906
Now, I got to admit, that
really did sound good.

16:06.405 --> 16:08.460
There's-there's a real
bear here, Calvin.

16:08.485 --> 16:10.488
Okay... So w-what do we do?

16:10.513 --> 16:11.514
We-we run for it?

16:11.539 --> 16:13.317
No, no, no. Bad idea.

16:13.342 --> 16:15.499
Bears can run up to 25 miles an hour.

16:15.524 --> 16:17.813
What can I run? Like 30, 35?

16:21.609 --> 16:23.635
Okay, we-we need to get to the RV.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.668
Aw, man, it smells terrible in there.

16:28.395 --> 16:29.864
You know what? I can live with it.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.758
Go, go, go, go!

16:32.352 --> 16:33.821
Maynard, you're not really gonna

16:33.846 --> 16:36.307
charge us $100 for a mop?

16:36.332 --> 16:38.169
I would love to cut you guys a deal,

16:38.194 --> 16:39.575
but capitalism, right?

16:39.600 --> 16:41.430
This is a straight up shakedown.

16:41.455 --> 16:43.332
Well, now, see? She gets it.

16:44.173 --> 16:45.856
No, no, no, no, no.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.715
What I get is that you're
a two-bit hustler.

16:47.749 --> 16:49.802
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Tina.

16:49.827 --> 16:52.713
That's no way to treat our
friend from Oklahoma.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.700
I saw your coffee mug. Was I wrong?

16:56.725 --> 16:59.357
Nope. Born and raised in Boynton.

16:59.382 --> 17:00.351
Wait, Boynton?

17:00.376 --> 17:02.112
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you kidding me?

17:02.137 --> 17:03.971
Is there still just one stoplight?

17:04.199 --> 17:05.522
There is.

17:05.694 --> 17:07.465
And is the Dairy Queen still there?

17:07.491 --> 17:10.027
- You mean the one by the highway?
- With the broken soft serve?

17:10.051 --> 17:11.309
That's the one.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.861
- Yeah, yeah!
- Wait.

17:12.886 --> 17:14.555
What about the sheriffs son, huh?

17:14.579 --> 17:15.694
Is he still up to no good?

17:15.720 --> 17:16.896
Oh, please, you kidding me?

17:16.921 --> 17:18.194
Hes the one who broke
the soft serve. Yeah!

17:20.521 --> 17:21.473
Oh!

17:21.498 --> 17:23.467
Oh, my gosh, what a small world.

17:23.492 --> 17:25.589
Oh, boy. No, I-I-I cant take advantage

17:25.615 --> 17:28.214
of a fellow Boyntonian.
20 bucks for everything.

17:28.239 --> 17:29.030
- Oh!
- Oh, yes!

17:29.055 --> 17:30.834
- Thank you so much.
- Great.

17:31.371 --> 17:33.053
You know what, you never
told me your name,

17:33.078 --> 17:35.315
and I still know everybody
back in Boynton.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.947
Oh... my name is...

17:39.658 --> 17:41.281
Run, Tina!

17:43.992 --> 17:46.318
This is how we do in Hickory Corners.

17:48.605 --> 17:50.140
This is all your fault.

17:50.595 --> 17:52.428
I knew camping was stupid.

17:53.125 --> 17:54.319
You know, every time you yell at me

17:54.344 --> 17:55.461
you're breathing more of this air.

17:55.486 --> 17:57.198
Its worth it.

17:58.938 --> 18:00.305
I wonder what attracted that bear.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.068
You locked the canister, right?

18:02.093 --> 18:03.743
Of course I did.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.709
Its not my fault the bears a genius.

18:13.697 --> 18:15.285
This is a disaster.

18:16.185 --> 18:18.886
I just wanted to share something
that I love with my family.

18:18.911 --> 18:20.965
Then why'd you drag us into it?

18:23.068 --> 18:25.135
Guess I think of you guys as family.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.144
You do?

18:28.844 --> 18:30.355
Yeah, I mean, ever since
we moved out here

18:30.380 --> 18:32.665
you guys have welcomed
us into your lives.

18:33.057 --> 18:35.277
I don't know what we
would've done without you.

18:36.492 --> 18:37.894
I mean,

18:37.919 --> 18:39.832
you guys have done stuff for us, too.

18:39.857 --> 18:40.964
You know,

18:40.989 --> 18:44.314
besides this incredibly
awful experience.

18:46.961 --> 18:49.993
You know, if it wasn't for
the terrible smell and...

18:50.466 --> 18:52.252
and the bear outside,

18:52.859 --> 18:54.731
this would be kind of a nice moment.

18:54.893 --> 18:57.650
Yeah... I guess it would be.

18:57.996 --> 19:00.115
Oh, my God, our families!

19:00.140 --> 19:02.829
I know, coming together as one, right?

19:03.372 --> 19:07.469
No, no. Our families are coming
back and there's a bear outside.

19:07.517 --> 19:09.783
You're right. Okay, we
got to do something.

19:09.808 --> 19:12.698
All right, look, I got a plan.
You're gonna run outside

19:12.723 --> 19:14.711
and you're gonna scare that bear away.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.878
Okay. What are you gonna do?

19:18.120 --> 19:19.685
I'm gonna stay in here.

19:20.781 --> 19:23.454
Grovers gonna need a
man in his life, Dave.

19:30.137 --> 19:31.186
Go away!

19:31.211 --> 19:33.015
Go, go, go!

19:33.160 --> 19:35.225
Go, boy, go!

19:35.250 --> 19:36.241
Don't kill us!

19:36.266 --> 19:37.266
Go!

19:38.583 --> 19:39.667
Yeah!

19:39.692 --> 19:42.186
- Whoa, it worked! Hes gone.
- That's right, bear!

19:42.211 --> 19:43.820
We run this forest!

19:44.775 --> 19:46.362
Ha!

19:46.513 --> 19:49.680
Calvin, we did it! We
saved our families.

19:49.705 --> 19:51.494
Yeah, like I told you,

19:51.519 --> 19:54.753
when it comes to man
versus wild, man always...

19:54.778 --> 19:57.836
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

19:58.327 --> 20:00.951
I-I-I thought that stick was a snake.

20:05.991 --> 20:08.220
So then the bear reared up

20:08.245 --> 20:09.882
on its hind legs

20:09.907 --> 20:11.585
and it roared at us!

20:11.610 --> 20:14.650
And that's when a even
bigger bear showed up.

20:14.675 --> 20:16.371
Whoa!

20:16.891 --> 20:18.826
You notice every time
they tell this story

20:18.851 --> 20:20.445
there's more bears in it?

20:20.949 --> 20:22.419
Shh, I don't want to miss the part

20:22.444 --> 20:24.381
where they saved all our lives.

20:25.211 --> 20:28.580
Look, I don't want to sound
too dramatic, but...

20:28.605 --> 20:31.420
But, uh, we saved all y'all lives.

20:34.493 --> 20:36.344
There you go.

20:37.378 --> 20:39.830
How many bears do you
think there really were?

20:40.025 --> 20:43.188
Girl, its probably just
a big-ass raccoon.
