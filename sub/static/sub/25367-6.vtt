00:05.860 --> 00:07.402
Did you get your grant?

00:07.485 --> 00:09.360
No. Uh, actually, you need me.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.110
-What?
-I'm from the VHA.

00:11.193 --> 00:12.735
I just came to check out
the facilities,

00:12.818 --> 00:14.610
-make sure everything's kosher.
-You work with veterans?

00:14.693 --> 00:16.485
[Ben] They sent me here
  to investigate this therapy.

00:16.568 --> 00:18.735
-You want to partner up?
 -Yeah.

00:18.819 --> 00:19.527
[Ben]
Close your eyes.

00:19.610 --> 00:20.777
What do you notice?

00:20.860 --> 00:22.443
I'm on the beach.

00:22.527 --> 00:24.527
-What are you seeing?
-I'm in the water.

00:24.610 --> 00:26.068
You're-you're in the water?

00:26.151 --> 00:29.402
I can't breathe.
I'm choking on the water.

00:29.485 --> 00:31.026
-And then these hands...
-Whose hands?

00:31.110 --> 00:33.735
Two big, strong hands
are pulling me from the water.

00:35.652 --> 00:37.026
What's that face?

00:37.110 --> 00:38.568
You amaze me.

00:38.652 --> 00:39.652
Hi. My name is Ben,

00:39.735 --> 00:41.068
and I'm an addict.

00:41.151 --> 00:42.568
-[group] Hey, Ben.
-[Cole] Hey, Ben.

00:42.652 --> 00:43.735
[Cole] Does she know
  you're married?

00:43.819 --> 00:45.652
-No.
-Of course not.

00:45.735 --> 00:48.402
I'm gonna tell her the truth.
Just give me a moment.

00:48.485 --> 00:49.694
-Hey, I sent you something.
-[Alison chuckles]

00:49.777 --> 00:52.235
-Oh, God. What?
  -It's just a gift card

00:52.318 --> 00:53.944

I'm not sure what's going on
in his home life,

01:01.735 --> 01:03.694
but I just feel he's under
 a lot of pressure.

01:03.777 --> 01:05.610

-It's a walkout, y'all.

-He's with his dad.

you, uh, got a second?

03:13.819 --> 03:16.360
Sure, Anton. What's up?

03:16.443 --> 03:19.735
So, uh, thank you for the "A"
on the Animal Farm  essay.

03:19.819 --> 03:22.860
The notes you gave me
were, uh... they were tight.

03:22.944 --> 03:24.985
Well, it was
a fine piece of work.

03:25.068 --> 03:27.944
I was, um, wondering
if you could

03:28.026 --> 03:30.777
take a look at this other thing
I've been working on,

03:30.860 --> 03:32.151
you know, maybe
give me some notes.

03:32.235 --> 03:33.985
I printed it out.
I know...

03:34.068 --> 03:35.652
sometimes older teachers
like that.

03:35.735 --> 03:36.735
[chuckling] Right.

03:36.819 --> 03:37.902
Thank you, Anton.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.527
What is it, a short story?

03:39.610 --> 03:41.026
No, um,
just an essay.

03:41.110 --> 03:42.860
Nothing...
nothing special.

03:42.944 --> 03:44.860

Yeah, maybe.
I don't... I don't know.

I can give her a call
if you want me to.

03:57.944 --> 03:59.610
You would do that?

03:59.694 --> 04:01.402
Of course I'd do that.

04:01.485 --> 04:03.610
And I'll read this,
let you know what I think.

04:03.694 --> 04:05.110
Well, thank you.

04:09.652 --> 04:12.193
No offense,
but, um, you know,

04:12.276 --> 04:13.819
I think you're a good
teacher and everything,

04:13.902 --> 04:15.819
but maybe you should
give the assignment

04:15.902 --> 04:17.985
in the beginning
of the class,

04:18.067 --> 04:19.860
'cause at the end of the class,
they're not listening.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.652

with me why?

to degrade him,

But Carl, he...

13:56.110 --> 13:57.902

They didn't have
these programs

14:01.944 --> 14:05.151
to help keep inner-city

14:05.235 --> 14:08.402
They treated him like
a curiosity at the zoo.

14:08.485 --> 14:10.068
The professors would
single him out in class

14:10.151 --> 14:12.068
and kind of turn him
into a spectacle.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.610
And then, after class,

14:13.694 --> 14:16.485
the kids would ask him
to get them drugs.

14:16.568 --> 14:18.485
It was awful for him.

14:18.568 --> 14:19.985
Of course,
then he decided

14:20.068 --> 14:21.694
that he would
sell them drugs,

14:21.777 --> 14:23.026
'cause if they
were constantly

14:23.110 --> 14:24.694
coming at him anyway,
he might as well

14:24.777 --> 14:26.527
make some money off these fools.

14:28.193 --> 14:30.318
He got caught
eventually,

14:30.402 --> 14:33.652
so he quit
right then and there.

with a 3.4 GPA.

14:38.860 --> 14:41.318

So now Anton's worried
he's gonna have

14:45.360 --> 14:47.819
the same experience
as his father.

14:47.902 --> 14:49.902
That's not what
he's worried about.

14:49.985 --> 14:51.402
Well, that's what
he says in his essay.

14:51.485 --> 14:52.485
It's all over it.

14:52.568 --> 14:54.402
He's lying.

the same places they used to be.

14:58.902 --> 15:00.360
They have support systems
in place,

15:00.443 --> 15:01.860

15:01.944 --> 15:03.652

15:03.735 --> 15:05.318

15:05.402 --> 15:07.735

what he's afraid of.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.694
He's afraid of doing well.

15:09.777 --> 15:10.652
Doing well?

15:10.735 --> 15:12.443
-Mm-hmm.
-Why?

15:12.527 --> 15:14.318
'Cause he thinks
it'll hurt Carl.

15:14.402 --> 15:17.110
That's why he plagiarized
his fucking paper.

15:17.193 --> 15:19.652
It had nothing
to do with me.

15:19.735 --> 15:22.235
If Anton doesn't go
to Princeton,

15:22.318 --> 15:24.568
he's not in danger
of winning a race

15:24.652 --> 15:26.276

15:27.527 --> 15:29.151
Does Carl know that?

15:29.235 --> 15:32.026
I don't know what Carl knows.

15:32.110 --> 15:34.860
I know he wants Anton
to stay in the community,

15:34.944 --> 15:36.652
go to USC or something.

15:36.735 --> 15:38.735
What do you think
about that idea?

15:38.819 --> 15:41.360
I think USC is a good school

15:41.443 --> 15:44.276

get into Princeton.

15:46.235 --> 15:48.360

15:57.402 --> 15:59.568
But every time we try
to talk about it,

15:59.652 --> 16:02.110
it just becomes a fight about
what happened in our marriage,

16:02.193 --> 16:04.276

going on with Trevor.

turn that essay in.

16:21.068 --> 16:23.568
It's not gonna
do his cause any good.

16:24.610 --> 16:25.819

he belongs in Princeton.

into her arms.

And-and I... I-I wanted
to respect her wishes,

30:30.443 --> 30:34.944

to do was...

I don't expect you
to forgive me, but...

I could pay you very well

watching you.

33:53.568 --> 33:55.235
A wave...

33:55.318 --> 33:57.568
had pulled you under.

33:57.652 --> 34:00.694
You were, uh,
too young to swim.

34:00.777 --> 34:02.652
I just went running
into the water.

34:02.735 --> 34:05.068
I dove in with all
my clothes on, I grabbed you--

34:05.151 --> 34:06.026
You grabbed me
with both your hands.

your affair.

-Our affair?
-Yeah, and how

and then you got angry

-and decided to punish him.
-Oh, my God.

35:34.694 --> 35:36.902
And you didn't even tell him you
were pregnant. You disappeared.

-You need to stop talking.

actually none of my business.

54:36.402 --> 54:38.235
Yeah, I-I didn't know.

54:39.777 --> 54:41.110
I found out today.

54:42.151 --> 54:43.443
He didn't tell you?

54:47.193 --> 54:48.777
Wow, that's
really terrible.

54:48.860 --> 54:50.985
I'm sorry.

54:56.902 --> 54:58.819
Helen, can I ask you something?

55:00.110 --> 55:03.068
Can you... be honest with me?

55:03.151 --> 55:05.485
I'll try.

55:07.777 --> 55:11.110
Why do men look at me and see
someone they can fuck with?

55:13.902 --> 55:16.276
Nobody thinks that about you.

55:18.819 --> 55:20.985
Like...

55:21.068 --> 55:23.235
what is it about me?

55:23.318 --> 55:25.193
It's like they can...

55:25.276 --> 55:27.527
It's like they can smell
something on me.

55:32.694 --> 55:35.527
Do you not think you had
any choice in the matter?

55:37.777 --> 55:40.402
I mean, you knew Noah
was married when you met him,

55:40.485 --> 55:42.360
and you could have
walked away, but you didn't.

55:47.944 --> 55:49.568
That's true.

55:49.652 --> 55:51.318
I don't know,
maybe I've been

55:51.402 --> 55:53.110
living in California
too long, but there's

55:53.193 --> 55:56.985
this idea out here
that, um...

55:57.068 --> 56:00.235
you can manifest
your reality.

56:00.318 --> 56:01.652
What?

56:01.735 --> 56:02.860
-Uh...
-[Alison chuckles]

56:02.944 --> 56:04.694
Like, um...

56:04.777 --> 56:07.276
if there's something
in your life

56:07.360 --> 56:09.110
you want to change,
you just need

56:09.193 --> 56:11.235
to think differently,
and it will change.

56:11.318 --> 56:13.151
But that's... that's insane.

56:13.235 --> 56:14.610
I know.

56:14.694 --> 56:17.360
But also, maybe, true.

56:19.694 --> 56:21.318
I mean, you've been
telling yourself

56:21.402 --> 56:23.610
the same story for a long time.

56:23.694 --> 56:25.902
You know, that bad things
always happen to you

56:25.985 --> 56:27.402
and bad things always will.

56:30.276 --> 56:33.026
What if you changed
the narrative?

56:33.110 --> 56:36.360
So you weren't
always the victim.

56:36.443 --> 56:38.151
You have agency
in your life, Alison.

56:38.235 --> 56:39.360
Maybe you've never
believed that,

56:39.443 --> 56:40.777
but I promise you, it's true.

56:40.860 --> 56:42.402
If you don't like
the way men

56:42.485 --> 56:43.902
are treating you,
change the story.

56:43.985 --> 56:45.860
-Play a different character.
-How?

56:45.985 --> 56:48.276
First of all, go home and tell
that guy to go fuck himself.

56:49.402 --> 56:51.026
Why not?

56:51.110 --> 56:52.235
Give it a shot.

56:52.318 --> 56:53.610
What's the worst he can do?

56:53.694 --> 56:54.944
Call you a bitch? Leave?

56:55.026 --> 56:56.819
He sounds like
an asshole anyway.

56:56.902 --> 56:59.068
Let him know it's not okay
to treat you like that.

57:03.902 --> 57:05.276
Maybe I will.

57:08.568 --> 57:10.318
Okay, I'll let you
get some sleep.

57:10.402 --> 57:11.694
Helen.

57:14.443 --> 57:16.068
Thank you.

57:18.360 --> 57:21.193
Alison, you have so much time.

57:22.318 --> 57:24.026
You're so young.

57:24.110 --> 57:25.402
You could have more kids.

57:25.485 --> 57:27.318
You could have a second act.

57:27.402 --> 57:29.068
You could do
whatever you want to do.

57:29.151 --> 57:30.777
But if you want
to change your life,

57:30.860 --> 57:32.443
you have to do it now.

57:35.068 --> 57:36.819
Good night.
