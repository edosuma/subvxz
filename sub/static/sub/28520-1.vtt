That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter.

01:25.213 --> 01:26.713
What's a windstorm?

01:26.796 --> 01:29.213
Jupiter is like a huge balloon,

01:29.546 --> 01:31.671
composed of 90% hydrogen.

01:31.755 --> 01:34.255
Grandpa, what's hydrogen?

01:34.338 --> 01:35.588
What is hydrogen?

01:36.963 --> 01:39.171
It's the fuel for Dad's rocket.

01:39.255 --> 01:40.463
Hydrogen is

14:18.588 --> 14:20.588
Haven't you been outside before?

14:20.671 --> 14:22.921
It wasn't this crowded last time.

14:23.046 --> 14:24.671
You are such a liar.

14:26.796 --> 14:28.671
How long will it take
to get to the surface?

14:29.005 --> 14:30.296
It's 5km,

14:30.880 --> 14:32.963
<i>so at least 15 minutes.</i>

14:33.338 --> 14:34.171
<i>Okay.</i>

14:46.421 --> 14:49.171
This is a communication device.
Press once to sync with the transporter.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.380
Twice for regional broadcast.

14:50.463 --> 14:52.088
Three times for the private channel.

14:52.171 --> 14:54.213
Once outside, stay close to me.

14:54.463 --> 14:55.296
Don't run around.

14:55.380 --> 14:56.671
Are you afraid?

15:26.005 --> 15:26.838
SURFACE LEVEL REACHED

15:28.338 --> 15:29.755
<i>Surface level reached.</i>

15:30.046 --> 15:32.755
<i>All personnel, be ready.</i>

16:08.130 --> 16:09.338
Let's go!

16:13.338 --> 16:15.338
Haven't you had enough
looking around? Let's go!

16:15.421 --> 16:16.713
I sneaked out.

16:16.796 --> 16:18.463
Am I getting expelled by the school?

16:18.963 --> 16:20.755
Have you already been
kicked out of your unit?

16:20.838 --> 16:22.005
Nonsense.

16:25.588 --> 16:28.338
Which one is Transporter 373?

16:28.671 --> 16:30.588
-Duoduo, come over!
-Okay.

16:33.546 --> 16:35.046
-Give me Grandpa's vehicle pass.
-Here.

16:43.088 --> 16:44.005
<i>Han Ziang.</i>

16:44.088 --> 16:45.046
<i>Senior driver.</i>

16:45.755 --> 16:48.630
<i>Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division
reminds you.</i>

16:48.838 --> 16:50.505
<i>Routes are countless.</i>

16:50.588 --> 16:52.255
<i>Safety is the priority.</i>

16:52.463 --> 16:54.088
<i>With unregulated driving,</i>

16:54.171 --> 16:56.046
<i>your loved ones might end up in tears.</i>

17:00.963 --> 17:03.213
Clutch. Gear.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.296
What the...

17:09.630 --> 17:11.296
Can you drive, Hu Kou?

17:11.380 --> 17:13.088
This transporter is not for everyone!

17:13.171 --> 17:15.088
It requires at least
five years of training.

17:15.171 --> 17:17.296
I am genius enough just to make it move.

17:17.380 --> 17:18.755
-Okay?
-Genius.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.671
Step on the clutch, hand on the gear,
then move. Heavy step, light hand.

17:28.213 --> 17:31.505
-Watch out! There are others ahead!
-Shit! Fuck!

17:41.963 --> 17:44.005
<i>Watch out!</i>

17:51.380 --> 17:54.546
<i>The world outside is huge!</i>

17:54.630 --> 17:56.671
<i>What are you yelling about?
So embarrassing!</i>

17:56.755 --> 17:58.088
Fine.

17:58.296 --> 17:59.880
Such strong winds today.

17:59.963 --> 18:01.838
Why are they mining these mountains?

18:02.213 --> 18:03.546
For fuel.

18:03.713 --> 18:05.338
Heavy fusion propulsion technology.

18:05.921 --> 18:08.713
Basically, it's burning rocks.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.588
The Earth Engine!

18:10.755 --> 18:12.796
These are Propulsion Engines.

18:13.005 --> 18:16.088
<i>There are 10,000 of them around the globe,
made for pushing Earth forward.</i>

18:16.505 --> 18:17.838
<i>This isn't the most gigantic one.</i>

18:17.963 --> 18:19.880
<i>Those Torque Engines along the equator,</i>

18:20.005 --> 18:21.963
<i>they are the real giants.</i>

19:39.255 --> 19:41.213
<i>Synchronous translation is on.</i>

19:41.755 --> 19:43.005
Peiqiang,

19:43.088 --> 19:44.505
happy retirement.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.338
One more day until I go home.

19:51.713 --> 19:52.963
Don't mess up my last dignity.

19:53.046 --> 19:54.921
Save this moonshine for yourself.

19:55.963 --> 19:57.963
I will store it somewhere safe for you.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.880
Save it for your farewell party.

19:59.963 --> 20:01.963
We are not getting another chance
once we hibernate.

20:10.463 --> 20:11.671
Don't you know

20:11.755 --> 20:15.755
how vodka was smuggled up
during Gagarin's time?

20:28.463 --> 20:30.338
We'll be entering
Jupiter's orbit today, right?

20:30.421 --> 20:34.713
Yes, we are already on standby
for Emergency Protocol No. 3.

20:35.505 --> 20:36.880
Something doesn't feel right.

20:37.505 --> 20:38.921
There's no other way.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.255
Earth can't leave the Solar System
without utilizing

20:41.338 --> 20:42.338
Jupiter's gravity.

20:42.463 --> 20:44.213
It is a risk we must take.

20:45.296 --> 20:47.255
God will bless us.

20:49.005 --> 20:50.713
It's the last procedure
for daily inspection.

20:51.546 --> 20:53.338
Check the Centrifugal Drive Control unit.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.880
Record the temperatures
of Centrifugal axle bearings.

20:58.838 --> 21:00.213
Understood.

21:10.005 --> 21:12.588
<i>Liu Peiqiang has completed
handover procedure.</i>

21:12.671 --> 21:13.921
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.</i>

21:14.005 --> 21:15.088
<i>Until today,</i>

21:15.171 --> 21:17.755
<i>you have accumulated a resting time
of 12 years and 3 days in total.</i>

21:18.255 --> 21:20.880
<i>An accumulated shift of 5 years
and 14 days total.</i>

21:21.171 --> 21:23.713
<i>We are grateful for your contributions
for the past 17 years.</i>

21:23.838 --> 21:26.921
<i>Congratulations on your duty completion
and journey home tomorrow.</i>

21:41.171 --> 21:42.088
Peiqiang,

21:43.380 --> 21:46.796
see you on Earth three years later.

21:46.921 --> 21:49.213
Go catch up with your son.

21:49.296 --> 21:51.213
You haven't spoken to him
for almost a decade.

21:56.088 --> 21:57.171
See you on Earth.

22:03.755 --> 22:05.213
Buddy,

22:05.838 --> 22:08.338
you'll be spending the next three years
with me now.

22:57.796 --> 22:59.921
<i>There's a supply depot 50km ahead.</i>

23:04.255 --> 23:05.505
Once we get there,

23:05.588 --> 23:06.630
you go back by yourself.

23:08.088 --> 23:10.671
Catch the nearest shuttle back,
so Grandpa won't worry about us.

23:11.671 --> 23:12.505
Oh, come on.

23:13.130 --> 23:16.088
You would be grabbed by the collar
once your dad gets back.

23:16.671 --> 23:19.421
I'm a genius.
No one is capable of catching me.

23:20.421 --> 23:22.505
What the... Car inspection.

23:24.171 --> 23:25.421
How did you get in here?

23:26.338 --> 23:27.755
Unregulated driving.

23:27.838 --> 23:30.005
Unregulated? You committed theft!

23:30.088 --> 23:32.671
I didn't steal. I just borrowed it.
It's my grandpa's vehicle pass.

23:32.755 --> 23:35.921
Nonsense. All transporters belong
to the UEG as public property.

23:36.005 --> 23:37.838
It's not up to your grandpa!

23:40.505 --> 23:41.505
What are you doing?

23:41.588 --> 23:42.463
It's way past bedtime!

23:42.546 --> 23:43.588
Sir,

23:44.130 --> 23:45.713
I'm just getting to know new friends.

23:46.338 --> 23:48.130
More friends, more options.

23:48.505 --> 23:49.338
Hand it over.

23:51.088 --> 23:52.380
You think it is yours?

23:52.546 --> 23:53.796
Hit the sack.

23:55.255 --> 23:56.213
Have a nice stroll.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.088
I am Tim.

23:59.630 --> 24:01.713
My dad is from Beijing,
and my mom is from Melbourne.

24:01.963 --> 24:04.255
A Sino-Australian joint venture.
Come on, just joking.

24:04.338 --> 24:05.505
Let's shake hands?

24:09.755 --> 24:10.755
Hello.

24:10.838 --> 24:12.338
Joint product.

24:12.421 --> 24:13.755
Let go of me!

24:13.838 --> 24:14.755
<i>That hurts!</i>

24:22.046 --> 24:23.255
JINING SUPPLY DEPOT ANNIVERSARY

24:25.380 --> 24:26.255
<i>Name of the visitor?</i>

24:27.880 --> 24:28.796
<i>Han Ziang.</i>

24:29.338 --> 24:31.005
<i>I'm here for my grandson.</i>

24:48.296 --> 24:49.463
Hey.

24:49.546 --> 24:51.046
You are here to bail out someone.

24:56.838 --> 24:58.005
Sir,

24:58.296 --> 24:59.963
my grandson is a mechanic trainee.

25:00.171 --> 25:01.880
He just wanted to touch the real thing.

25:01.963 --> 25:04.088
Please go easy on him.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.713
Transporters are
highly valuable public property.

25:09.671 --> 25:13.213
Lending out your vehicle pass privately
is also a serious offense.

25:17.588 --> 25:19.213
This is good stuff.

25:19.713 --> 25:21.796
It has a collection of hotties
from the past 50 years.

25:22.171 --> 25:23.505
It's all in there.

25:25.421 --> 25:26.421
Oh, well...

25:29.880 --> 25:30.838
Same old trick.

25:48.546 --> 25:50.213
Stop shaking, old man!

25:56.338 --> 25:57.796
What old man?

25:57.880 --> 25:59.755
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

25:59.838 --> 26:00.838
Running away from home...

26:00.921 --> 26:03.421
You're too old to be running away.
He is your own dad.

26:03.505 --> 26:06.213
Where are you going to hide?
You even brought your little sister out?

26:06.296 --> 26:08.171
It's dangerous outside!

26:08.838 --> 26:09.755
And you!

26:12.755 --> 26:14.588
You learned to steal!

26:16.005 --> 26:17.171
You stole my pass!

26:17.255 --> 26:19.213
Should you do
whatever your brother told you to do?

26:19.838 --> 26:21.088
Are you dumb?

26:21.671 --> 26:23.963
I didn't intend to bring her along.
But she was begging me

26:24.088 --> 26:25.796
-to take her.
-As her brother...

26:26.255 --> 26:28.255
Liu Qi! You liar!

26:28.338 --> 26:29.463
Here she goes again.

26:29.755 --> 26:30.963
Nicely said!

26:31.463 --> 26:32.588
Ignoring elderly's advice--

26:32.671 --> 26:34.171
Mind your own business!

26:34.255 --> 26:35.421
Don't take it out on the wall,

26:35.505 --> 26:37.421
take it out on me if you dare.

26:37.546 --> 26:39.171
What the...

26:47.046 --> 26:48.130
Earthquake!

26:48.213 --> 26:50.005
Thirteen Orphans! I won!

27:06.296 --> 27:07.880
Open the door!

27:08.005 --> 27:09.505
-Open the door!
-Can anyone help?

27:09.588 --> 27:10.796
Anyone?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.963
Over here!

27:15.630 --> 27:17.088
-Hurry up! Open the door!
-Here!

27:33.963 --> 27:35.505
Don't leave me!

27:36.838 --> 27:37.713
Is anyone there?

27:38.380 --> 27:40.463
My mom needs me and my kid...

27:40.546 --> 27:42.088
I don't have a kid yet!

27:42.171 --> 27:43.005
Hey!

27:43.713 --> 27:45.296
Please help me, man.

27:45.380 --> 27:46.421
-Hu Kou.
-Come on.

27:46.505 --> 27:48.130
-Hu Kou, come back.
-Come here.

27:48.296 --> 27:49.213
Grab the key.

27:49.380 --> 27:51.796
The key? The key is pinned underneath.

27:51.963 --> 27:54.088
What are you doing?
You can't pull it open!

27:58.963 --> 28:00.671
Can't you move quickly?

28:01.380 --> 28:02.296
Wait for me.

28:27.921 --> 28:29.755
<i>Engine No. 3 has stopped.</i>

28:30.005 --> 28:31.630
<i>Engine No. 7 has stopped too.</i>

28:31.921 --> 28:32.838
Shit.

28:32.963 --> 28:35.130
-Get the chief engineer! Quick!
-Got it.

28:56.213 --> 28:58.630
<i>Han Ziang. Senior driver.</i>

28:58.713 --> 29:01.505
<i>Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division

29:08.338 --> 29:09.380
Shut up, stupid!

29:09.463 --> 29:10.796
Move it!

29:40.338 --> 29:41.796
Hu Kou! Detach!

29:51.296 --> 29:52.796
Hu Kou!

29:54.880 --> 29:56.130
I feel dizzy.

30:24.505 --> 30:26.088
<i>Top priority from UEG.</i>

30:26.171 --> 30:28.213
<i>Top priority from UEG.</i>

30:28.505 --> 30:30.046
<i>To all standby forces on Earth,</i>

30:30.130 --> 30:31.921
<i>due to Jupiter's

<i>To avoid collision with Jupiter,</i>

<i>every unit must execute Emergency Protocol

30:59.796 --> 31:01.338
Rescue units are on the go!

31:08.630 --> 31:10.463
Lisa, low consumption mode implemented.

31:10.546 --> 31:12.630
Regular communication services
will be cut off shortly.

31:12.713 --> 31:14.255
Low consumption mode activated.

31:14.338 --> 31:15.171
I just got here.

31:15.255 --> 31:17.088
How would I know if there's hibernation?

31:18.213 --> 31:21.171
MOSS, please contact my relative.
Contact Liu Qi.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.213
<i>Liu Qi isn't in the allocated living area.</i>

31:23.880 --> 31:25.796

MOSS.
Contact transporter driver, Han Ziang.

31:33.963 --> 31:35.671
<i>Incoming connection.</i>

31:39.588 --> 31:40.921
<i>Peiqiang? Is that you?</i>

31:41.921 --> 31:43.088
Father, it's me.

31:43.171 --> 31:44.505
<i>Have you seen Liu Qi?</i>

31:45.130 --> 31:46.296
Liu Qi is right here with me.

31:47.296 --> 31:48.796
We just escaped an earthquake.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.213
We are on the surface now.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.255
MOSS, locate the transporter

31:52.338 --> 31:54.588
and guide it to the nearest refuge center.

31:54.671 --> 31:56.130
What's there to say to him?

31:56.630 --> 31:59.588
<i>Transporter 373, Driver Han Ziang.</i>

31:59.671 --> 32:03.255
<i>Please proceed to

What's this?

32:49.463 --> 32:51.921
Emergency communication authorization code
of Liu Qi's dad.

32:53.046 --> 32:54.588
It's a direct line to the space station.

32:57.046 --> 32:58.255
<i>Transporter 373.</i>

32:58.338 --> 32:59.380
<i>Please slow down and stop.</i>

<i>Wait for further instructions.</i>

33:03.255 --> 33:06.005
<i>Transporter 373,

33:57.296 --> 33:58.338
I swear,

33:59.671 --> 34:01.255
that girl from the day before,

34:01.588 --> 34:02.588
she was totally voluntary!

34:02.671 --> 34:03.588
Shut up!

34:03.963 --> 34:04.963
They are not here for you.

34:11.005 --> 34:13.005
We are a rescue team, unit CN171-11,

34:13.088 --> 34:15.463
assigned to Hangzhou 01 Earth Engine.

34:15.546 --> 34:19.171
In accordance with The Wandering Earth
Act, Article 32, Section 1.

34:19.588 --> 34:21.880
Your transporter and crew

34:22.588 --> 34:23.671
have been requisited.

34:28.755 --> 34:30.213
<i>To save the cargo container,</i>

34:30.296 --> 34:32.921
<i>their driver decoupled his transporter
and went down the crevasse,</i>

34:33.005 --> 34:34.588
<i>sacrificing himself.</i>

34:35.755 --> 34:36.755
What's inside?

34:37.380 --> 34:38.505
What could be that important?

34:39.088 --> 34:40.838
<i>Boss! Cargo container has been reloaded.</i>

34:40.921 --> 34:42.380
<i>Engineers, check on the Lighter Core.</i>

34:42.463 --> 34:44.088
<i>Zhou Qian,
reorganize the transporter crew.</i>

34:44.171 --> 34:45.880
<i>-Move out as soon as possible!
-Roger that.</i>

34:47.255 --> 34:48.505
Lighter Core?

34:48.588 --> 34:51.713
<i>Isn't that
the Earth Engine's trigger device?</i>

34:52.213 --> 34:55.546
No Earth Engine has shut down
for the past 30 years.

34:56.713 --> 34:58.630
This is not a simple rescue mission.

34:58.713 --> 35:00.130
A lot of people will die.

35:00.755 --> 35:02.380
<i>Boss! Lighter Core self-check completed.</i>

35:02.463 --> 35:03.671
<i>Everything is normal.</i>

35:23.880 --> 35:26.130
Please assist Mission 1125.

35:26.296 --> 35:27.296
Deliver the Lighter Core.

35:27.380 --> 35:29.005
Restart Hangzhou Earth Engine.

35:35.921 --> 35:36.963
<i>Clear the road.</i>

35:37.046 --> 35:38.796
<i>Let the team
with the Lighter Core pass first.</i>

35:40.921 --> 35:42.338
<i>Captain Wang from unit 171-11,</i>

35:42.421 --> 35:43.588
<i>our destination is Nanjing.</i>

35:43.671 --> 35:45.171
<i>Don't wait for us. Please move forward.</i>

35:45.255 --> 35:47.005
<i>Copy that. We wish you the best.</i>

35:55.171 --> 35:56.463
<i>Unit 171-01,</i>

35:56.546 --> 35:58.005
<i>we're entering Shanghai area.</i>

35:58.213 --> 35:59.338
<i>Report road status.</i>

36:00.421 --> 36:03.338
<i>Tectonic plate movements sourced
in Shanghai area. Proceed with caution.</i>

36:03.505 --> 36:04.338
<i>Roger that.</i>

36:05.588 --> 36:06.755
Boss! Look!

36:16.796 --> 36:17.630
Our home.

36:19.296 --> 36:21.255
What happened to it?

36:22.630 --> 36:25.005
Liu Zi, report 171's locations.

36:26.380 --> 36:28.255
Unit 06's signal
was last received at Cangzhou.

36:28.338 --> 36:30.838
The signals of Unit 09, 13, and 15
were last received at Huaian.

36:30.963 --> 36:32.755
The other units have made it to Shanghai.

36:32.838 --> 36:34.171
They are on their way to Hangzhou.

36:34.755 --> 36:36.546
-Boss.
-You guys go take a look.

36:36.630 --> 36:38.546
-Roger that.
-Yes, sir.

36:49.755 --> 36:51.296
Liu Zi, scout.

37:08.088 --> 37:10.130
Our team is up ahead
The estimated distance is 80km.

37:11.338 --> 37:12.380
Follow the crevasse.

37:12.463 --> 37:14.130
We should rendezvous within an hour.

37:15.963 --> 37:18.713
This place looks unstable.
Pass through as soon as possible.

37:19.755 --> 37:22.213
-Load up. Move out.
-Roger.

37:31.755 --> 37:33.130
<i>Engineer team, stay alert.</i>

37:34.005 --> 37:35.588
<i>This is unit 171-11.</i>

37:35.796 --> 37:37.380
<i>We have entered Shanghai area.</i>

37:39.421 --> 37:41.588
<i>Unit 11, be alert.
We've received a distress signal.</i>

37:41.755 --> 37:44.130
<i>-Please check the surrounding environment.</i>
-Copy that.

37:46.546 --> 37:48.630
<i>01, collapsed subway station ahead.</i>

37:48.713 --> 37:49.546
<i>Please detour.</i>

37:50.088 --> 37:51.213
<i>Copy that.</i>

38:08.713 --> 38:09.755
Duoduo.

38:10.880 --> 38:11.713
Don't be afraid.

38:11.796 --> 38:13.463
This was Grandpa's home.

38:14.838 --> 38:16.130
Look at those tall buildings,

38:17.171 --> 38:19.213
<i>a lot of people used to live there.</i>

38:20.921 --> 38:22.005
<i>Back then,</i>

38:22.296 --> 38:24.671
<i>no one was concerned about the Sun.</i>

38:25.255 --> 38:29.088
<i>Everyone was concerned about
the thing called money.</i>

38:31.046 --> 38:34.005
Grandpa couldn't make
a lot of money back then,

38:34.421 --> 38:36.755
but I was happy every day.

38:37.380 --> 38:39.838
Especially on my way home every day,

38:39.921 --> 38:41.796
I could smell

38:41.880 --> 38:44.880
your grandma's cooking from far away.

38:46.296 --> 38:49.671
Actually, she could barely cook,

38:50.046 --> 38:52.171
except for scallion noodles.

38:52.505 --> 38:53.588
I tell you,

38:53.671 --> 38:55.921
her scallion noodles

38:57.255 --> 38:59.255
are incredibly salty.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.171
But I slurped it all up.

39:02.255 --> 39:04.546
My bowl was licked clean every time.

39:06.088 --> 39:07.338
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.</i>

39:07.421 --> 39:08.963
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Makarov.</i>

39:09.296 --> 39:11.296
<i>Please initiate hibernation mode
as soon as possible.</i>

39:11.380 --> 39:12.755
Don't worry,

39:12.838 --> 39:14.421
your son will be safe.

39:26.380 --> 39:27.296
MOSS.

39:27.838 --> 39:29.088
Where is Liu Qi now?

39:32.296 --> 39:33.380
Why are they in Shanghai?

39:33.463 --> 39:35.171
<i>Transporter 373</i>

39:35.255 --> 39:37.046
<i>has been integrated into
the rescue mission.</i>

39:37.130 --> 39:39.546
<i>En route to Hangzhou 01 Earth Engine.</i>

39:40.338 --> 39:42.463
Who's in command?
Request to connect with him.

39:44.588 --> 39:45.796
<i>Incoming connection.</i>

39:47.755 --> 39:48.755
Captain Wang Lei,

39:48.880 --> 39:49.880
this is the space station.

39:49.963 --> 39:51.921
I am astronaut Liu Peiqiang.

39:52.546 --> 39:54.046
Hello, Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.

39:54.130 --> 39:56.713
I'm the unit commander for CN171-11.

39:56.796 --> 39:57.921
Please give the instructions.

39:58.296 --> 39:59.130
<i>Captain Wang Lei,</i>

40:02.005 --> 40:03.713
into the nearest underground city quickly.

40:04.130 --> 40:05.421
<i>Lieutenant Liu Peiqiang,</i>

40:05.505 --> 40:07.963
<i>we have an urgent rescue mission.
Thanks for your understanding.</i>

40:08.046 --> 40:10.421
I'll resettle the civilians
at the Jiaxing refuge center.

40:10.505 --> 40:12.296
A transporter has
a special operating system.

40:12.380 --> 40:14.671
We'll be needing driver Han Ziang.

40:15.505 --> 40:16.880
Over.

40:20.088 --> 40:23.213
Captain Wang Lei.
This is a dangerous rescue mission,

40:23.296 --> 40:26.546
-please ensure the safety of Han Ziang.
-I'll stay! I can drive this transporter.

40:26.630 --> 40:29.671
When we arrive at Jiaxing,
let Grandpa and the others get off.

40:35.255 --> 40:36.338
You can operate shit.

40:36.921 --> 40:38.338
Just follow the orders!

40:38.671 --> 40:40.796
Captain Wang Lei, he is still a kid.

40:42.171 --> 40:43.005
<i>He is not capable--</i>

40:43.088 --> 40:45.130
What rights do you have
to make decisions for me?

40:46.463 --> 40:47.380
My mom's death

40:48.046 --> 40:50.171
<i>was your decision.</i>

40:50.963 --> 40:53.546
<i>-Liu Qi, what are you talking about?</i>
-Am I wrong?

40:56.421 --> 40:57.796
<i>After I leave,</i>

40:59.671 --> 41:02.963
<i>only one custodian can accompany Liu Qi
into the underground city.</i>

41:03.463 --> 41:06.255
<i>She's gravely ill.
She won't hold up much longer.</i>

41:08.046 --> 41:09.296
<i>Giving up her treatment</i>

41:12.588 --> 41:14.713
<i>is the only way
to ensure both of you and Liu Qi</i>

41:15.546 --> 41:16.630
<i>will survive.</i>

41:17.796 --> 41:19.338
That's enough. I get it.

41:23.255 --> 41:24.255
So be it.

41:26.421 --> 41:27.296
<i>Father.</i>

41:31.380 --> 41:32.213
<i>Sorry.</i>

41:39.963 --> 41:43.796
<i>Atmospheric pressure is dropping.
We are unable to maintain airborne.</i>

41:43.880 --> 41:47.296
<i>Air force rescue unit CN114-03,
force landing!</i>

41:55.171 --> 41:57.171
MOSS, what's the status on Earth?

41:57.338 --> 41:59.255
<i>Jupiter's gravitational spike detected.</i>

41:59.338 --> 42:01.838
<i>All surface communications
in Shanghai area were lost.</i>

42:05.963 --> 42:06.921
Be on alert!

42:07.005 --> 42:08.380
Something might crush us.

42:11.838 --> 42:12.880
MOSS,

42:13.046 --> 42:14.380
surface status report!

42:14.505 --> 42:16.213
<i>Due to Jupiter's gravitational spike,</i>

<i> Earth is experiencing global aftershocks,</i>

<i>tectonic plates fracturing

42:35.838 --> 42:36.880
The glass.

42:38.421 --> 42:39.588
The glass is going to crack.

42:44.838 --> 42:46.130
Death is normal.

42:49.671 --> 42:51.755
All units! Helmets on!

43:00.338 --> 43:01.213
What are you doing?

43:03.130 --> 43:03.963
Let go!

43:04.046 --> 43:05.421
Go away!

43:06.088 --> 43:07.213
Let go!

43:08.130 --> 43:09.130
Two hundred meters ahead!

43:09.213 --> 43:10.255

43:22.380 --> 43:23.463
Quick!

43:46.838 --> 43:48.338
What? Evacuation?

43:48.880 --> 43:51.213
MOSS, connect me to the UEG

43:54.671 --> 43:55.671
<i>Hibernation gas releasing.</i>

<i>Evacuation procedure.
Hibernate immediately.</i>

43:58.380 --> 44:00.088
MOSS, open the cabin!

44:00.588 --> 44:01.755
MOSS, open the cabin!

44:01.838 --> 44:03.421
Open the cabin, MOSS!

44:04.088 --> 44:06.005
MOSS, open the cabin!

44:06.088 --> 44:07.630
This is desertion!

44:29.588 --> 44:30.796
<i>Help!</i>

44:30.880 --> 44:31.963
<i>I don't want to die here!</i>

Help!

44:33.671 --> 44:34.796
Help!

44:36.588 --> 44:38.963
Didn't you say death was normal?

Help!

44:43.838 --> 44:44.671
<i>Boss,</i>

<i>I can't reach them!</i>

44:47.838 --> 44:49.463
Da Gang, transport the Lighter Core!

44:49.546 --> 44:51.755
Chui Zi, Ya Tou, save the others.
Liu Zi, find a way out!

44:51.838 --> 44:53.255
-Everyone, abandon the vehicle!
-Yes!

44:56.713 --> 44:57.963
Go!

44:59.880 --> 45:01.130
Get in!

45:05.171 --> 45:06.880
Hurry! Get in quickly!

45:07.755 --> 45:09.880
Help!

45:10.713 --> 45:11.546
What's going on?

45:11.630 --> 45:12.796
Are you okay?

45:12.880 --> 45:14.755
-Stay calm. We'll get you out now.
-Hurry up!

45:21.505 --> 45:23.171
Normal.

45:23.255 --> 45:25.421
Old man, quick on feet.

45:36.588 --> 45:38.296
Boss, the Lighter Core
is in good condition.

45:40.546 --> 45:41.630
Fuck you!

45:41.713 --> 45:44.546
You're still hauling this damned ball,
even now?

45:45.171 --> 45:47.338
Among all the Lighter Cores
that were meant for Hangzhou,

45:47.421 --> 45:48.838
this is the last one.

45:49.338 --> 45:51.255
We've lost all our units.

45:51.338 --> 45:53.546
This Lighter Core is Hangzhou's only hope.

45:53.630 --> 45:54.755
Nice speech,

45:55.255 --> 45:57.713
but what about my two grandchildren?

46:10.505 --> 46:12.338
<i>Boss, this building looks intact.</i>

46:13.005 --> 46:14.630
<i>We can try to climb up from inside.</i>

46:15.338 --> 46:16.213
<i>Good.</i>

46:16.296 --> 46:17.880
<i>Let's get the Lighter Core out now.</i>

46:49.796 --> 46:53.005
-Liu Zi, find a way out.
-Roger.

46:59.005 --> 47:00.796
<i>Gang Zi, Zhou Qian. Load the Lighter Core.</i>

47:08.963 --> 47:10.338
Hold on.

47:11.630 --> 47:12.463
Load people first.

47:16.213 --> 47:17.463
Load

47:18.255 --> 47:19.338
people first.

47:24.130 --> 47:26.463
Stop wasting time.
Load the Lighter Core and people together!

47:30.088 --> 47:31.046
Slow down.

47:31.130 --> 47:32.921
I have acrophobia.

47:40.546 --> 47:43.005
Boss, I found an opening.

47:43.171 --> 47:45.296
We can't use dynamite here!
This building is crumbling.

47:50.713 --> 47:53.130
Chui Zi, Liu Zi. Anyone, find a way out!

47:54.880 --> 47:56.588
Ya Tou, you take over.

48:08.005 --> 48:09.296
Hu Kou! Grandpa!

48:09.380 --> 48:10.421
Hurry up!

48:12.213 --> 48:13.921
<i>Gang Zi, report position

48:14.171 --> 48:16.546
The 50th floor. Below Han Ziang!

48:22.046 --> 48:24.088
Here it is!

48:24.963 --> 48:26.255
Right here! The thinnest part!

48:26.338 --> 48:27.380
Is this the thinnest part?

48:27.463 --> 48:29.296
-I'll leave this to you.
-Okay.

48:53.213 --> 48:54.505
The pulley can't hold any longer.

48:54.588 --> 48:55.713
Pull up the Lighter Core.

48:55.796 --> 48:56.963
Are you okay, old man?

48:57.046 --> 48:58.671
Leave me! Go up quickly!

49:03.005 --> 49:04.046
Hu Kou.

49:04.130 --> 49:06.338
-Wang Lei! Pull my grandpa up!
-Go up quickly.

49:07.046 --> 49:09.005
Gang Zi. Your position.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.213
The Lighter Core is now on the 75th floor.

49:13.546 --> 49:14.380
Quick!

49:20.255 --> 49:21.380
Old man!

49:38.463 --> 49:40.630
Get up here, you old man!

49:46.046 --> 49:47.213
You guys go first.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.880
Wang Lei, I can't hold it any more!

49:56.880 --> 49:57.796
<i>Old man!</i>

49:57.880 --> 49:59.630
<i>Old man!</i>

50:16.005 --> 50:17.255
Let me go, kid.

50:19.713 --> 50:23.671
Grandpa!

50:24.755 --> 50:26.421
Gang Zi!

50:45.880 --> 50:46.921
Boss.

50:47.171 --> 50:48.213
Gang Zi is gone.

51:16.380 --> 51:17.296
Stop dazing.

51:17.380 --> 51:18.338
Han Ziang is gone.

51:18.421 --> 51:19.671
Get them two out of here.

51:20.796 --> 51:22.171
Liu Qi.

51:22.671 --> 51:25.963
-Duoduo, let's move.
-Liu Qi.

51:29.796 --> 51:31.963
<i>Hu Kou.</i>

51:32.380 --> 51:33.713
<i>Are you and Duoduo</i>

51:34.338 --> 51:35.463
<i>safe?</i>

51:39.088 --> 51:40.005
Old man.

51:40.088 --> 51:41.130
Move.

51:41.296 --> 51:42.421
Where are you, old man?

51:43.046 --> 51:44.213
<i>I'm coming to get you.</i>

51:44.421 --> 51:47.046
<i>Grandpa.</i>

51:47.671 --> 51:50.005
-I'm sorry, Grandpa.
-Where's the old man?

52:02.505 --> 52:05.046
Hu Kou, save Grandpa!

52:05.130 --> 52:07.213
<i>Liu Qi, you save Grandpa!</i>

52:07.546 --> 52:09.380
<i>Where are you, old man?</i>

52:42.588 --> 52:45.546
<i>On the 17th day
after the Earth stopped spinning,</i>

52:46.838 --> 52:48.713
<i>I saved a child.</i>

52:50.505 --> 52:53.963
<i>She was handed over to me
by countless hands.</i>

52:57.088 --> 53:00.088
<i>I don't know who her parents are.</i>

53:01.505 --> 53:03.755
<i>Every soul under the water</i>

53:05.005 --> 53:06.463
<i>could be her parent.</i>

53:10.296 --> 53:12.880
<i>I named her Han Duoduo.</i>

53:14.755 --> 53:17.296
<i>I named her after my daughter.</i>

53:17.380 --> 53:18.630
Grandpa!

53:18.713 --> 53:20.505
I am so sorry, old man.

53:20.588 --> 53:21.421
<i>My grandchildren,</i>

53:21.505 --> 53:23.380
<i>-don't be afraid.</i>
-Come up now!

53:23.463 --> 53:24.421
<i>From then on,</i>

53:24.796 --> 53:26.463
<i>we are a family.</i>

53:37.755 --> 53:39.046
<i>Hu Kou.</i>

53:39.463 --> 53:41.005
<i>As a brother,</i>

53:43.171 --> 53:44.963
<i>you have to watch over your sister.</i>

53:45.046 --> 53:46.505
Old man!

53:46.588 --> 53:48.713
<i>Take Duoduo home.</i>

53:59.963 --> 54:03.296
-Grandpa!
-Duoduo.

54:03.421 --> 54:04.796
-It's dangerous.
-Duoduo.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.588
-Step back.
-Duoduo.

54:10.213 --> 54:12.171
Why didn't you save my grandpa?

54:19.380 --> 54:20.838
This is our fate!

54:20.921 --> 54:22.421
Let my brother go!

54:24.088 --> 54:25.338
Duoduo.

54:27.296 --> 54:30.046
-Chui Zi. Ya Tou, take them away.
-Roger.

54:33.505 --> 54:35.963
-Don't touch her.
-Duoduo, it's dangerous.

54:36.380 --> 54:37.546
Stop moving.

54:39.630 --> 54:41.380
You will both freeze to death here!

54:42.255 --> 54:43.880
I'm not leaving with you.

54:44.046 --> 54:46.088
I'm going home with my brother.

54:46.171 --> 54:48.338
Boss, if we march to Hangzhou
at full speed,

54:48.421 --> 54:50.838
-it will take us three hours to get there.
-Let me go!

54:50.921 --> 54:52.296
The transporter is gone.

54:53.421 --> 54:57.838
I'm no longer useful to you.

55:02.380 --> 55:04.296
Give them the backup supplies
and navigations!

55:04.380 --> 55:05.421
Let's move!

55:05.505 --> 55:06.838
-Duoduo.
-Let's rush to Hangzhou.

55:07.088 --> 55:08.463
Duoduo, let's go home.

55:10.921 --> 55:12.921
Grandpa is gone.

55:13.713 --> 55:16.338
Where is our home?

56:44.380 --> 56:45.546
Liu Peiqiang.

56:45.796 --> 56:47.171
What are you doing?

56:47.255 --> 56:50.005
The space station has escaped!
Earth's communications will be paralyzed.

56:50.380 --> 56:51.921
The people on Earth have been abandoned.

56:52.546 --> 56:53.713
My son is still there!

56:53.796 --> 56:55.880
Have you lost your mind?
Because of your son?

56:55.963 --> 56:57.630
We're in a low consumption mode.

56:57.713 --> 56:59.963
You will be handed over
to the military court!

57:00.380 --> 57:01.838
Low consumption mode is a ruse!

57:02.130 --> 57:03.255
See it for yourself.

57:05.338 --> 57:06.880
Perhaps MOSS is malfunctioning.

57:08.505 --> 57:09.588
It's desertion!

57:12.505 --> 57:14.380
<i>What are you planning to do?</i>

57:15.005 --> 57:17.630
<i>I must head to the central control module
and stop the space station.</i>

57:28.421 --> 57:32.421
Liu, are you sure
we have to go via this airlock?

57:32.505 --> 57:35.671
Makarov, maybe you shouldn't come with me.

57:36.463 --> 57:39.046
You won't make it without me.

57:39.130 --> 57:41.921
Do you think you know
the exterior like I do?

57:42.005 --> 57:44.671
Don't forget, we Russians invented
space station 100 years ago.

57:50.005 --> 57:51.588
The airlock wasn't designed for exiting.

57:51.671 --> 57:54.005
Are you sure this is going to work?

57:54.630 --> 57:56.046
I'm sure.

57:58.213 --> 57:59.463
Didn't we plan to take our kids

57:59.546 --> 58:00.963
to go salmon fishing on Lake Baikal?

58:01.046 --> 58:03.255
I'd rather have hot pot in Chongqing.

58:05.505 --> 58:07.005
<i>The central control module is coming.</i>

58:10.713 --> 58:13.713
Russian cosmonauts
are invincible in the space.

58:17.713 --> 58:19.338
-Grab me, Liu Peiqiang!
-Makarov!

58:19.463 --> 58:21.255
I don't want to die!

58:23.880 --> 58:24.713
Makarov!

58:24.796 --> 58:27.005
Quick! Pull quickly!

58:36.546 --> 58:38.213
I'd rather sleep in the hibernation unit.

58:40.130 --> 58:42.796
Jupiter has captured Earth's atmosphere.

58:45.713 --> 58:47.671
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

58:53.880 --> 58:54.880
<i>Over there!</i>

58:55.421 --> 58:57.171
<i>The distress signal is coming from there.</i>

59:00.255 --> 59:02.171
Even the plane
of the air rescue unit has crashed.

59:12.588 --> 59:14.130
An intact transporter.

59:15.671 --> 59:17.588
It should be the source
of the distress signal.

59:19.005 --> 59:20.046
I'll check the transporter.

59:20.130 --> 59:21.213
You go on board for shelter.

59:21.296 --> 59:23.171
Search for anything useful.

59:30.713 --> 59:31.921
Anybody, come help!

59:32.005 --> 59:33.338
-Liu Qi!
-I don't want this!

59:35.213 --> 59:37.171
Come on! I'm going to kill her!

59:40.838 --> 59:42.463
Come over, quick!

59:43.213 --> 59:44.463
You! Calm down!

59:44.546 --> 59:45.630
We are a rescue unit.

59:53.713 --> 59:54.546
It's okay.

59:54.755 --> 59:56.505
Calm down.

1:00:05.921 --> 1:00:07.463
The mission of our air force rescue unit

1:00:07.755 --> 1:00:09.755
is to restart the Torque Engines
along the equator.

1:00:10.713 --> 1:00:13.255
But Jupiter's gravitational force
has thinned out our atmosphere.

1:00:14.630 --> 1:00:15.838
The aircraft can't fly anymore.

1:00:15.963 --> 1:00:17.838
I don't know
how many aircrafts had survived.

1:00:19.005 --> 1:00:20.380
Thanks.

1:00:20.463 --> 1:00:22.421
Calm yourself. Talk to us after you eat.

1:00:25.838 --> 1:00:28.463
Aren't you guys a Chinese rescue unit?
Why is there a foreigner here?

1:00:28.546 --> 1:00:29.921
Who's a foreigner?

1:00:30.380 --> 1:00:31.463
My dad is from Beijing.

1:00:32.088 --> 1:00:33.755
I am an authentic

1:00:35.005 --> 1:00:36.338
Chinese man.

1:00:38.255 --> 1:00:40.005
This transporter is functioning.

1:00:40.088 --> 1:00:41.005
That's good news.

1:00:41.505 --> 1:00:42.838
We can go home.

1:00:43.463 --> 1:00:45.796
Man, you can operate this transporter?

1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:48.171
Yes. So what?

1:00:50.380 --> 1:00:53.463
Everyone. We've got to hurry.
Time is ticking.

1:00:59.921 --> 1:01:02.671
<i>Re-establishing data connection
with unit 0051.</i>

1:01:02.921 --> 1:01:05.880
<i>Mission object, Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.</i>

1:01:07.713 --> 1:01:10.171
We have a Lighter Core on board.
The mission has to continue.

1:01:11.380 --> 1:01:15.380
<i>I'm the commander
for rescue unit CN171-11.</i>

1:01:15.713 --> 1:01:19.171
<i>Our unit has to reactivate
Hangzhou 01 Earth Engine.</i>

1:01:20.421 --> 1:01:21.296
<i>Does anyone copy?</i>

1:01:21.380 --> 1:01:22.588
<i>Please reply!</i>

1:01:23.213 --> 1:01:25.463
<i>Magma has leaked into
Hangzhou underground city.</i>

1:01:25.546 --> 1:01:26.796
WANG LEI

1:01:27.046 --> 1:01:28.713
<i>There are 350,000 people trapped.</i>

1:01:29.171 --> 1:01:32.838
<i>Our Lighter Core is their only hope.</i>

1:01:33.671 --> 1:01:35.213
<i>Does anyone copy?</i>

1:01:35.296 --> 1:01:37.046
<i>-I'm the commander...</i>
-Can't handle that much.

1:01:37.130 --> 1:01:39.588
Engines along the equator
are the most important rescue target.

1:01:39.671 --> 1:01:42.171
Even without stops, it'll
take more than ten hours to get there.

1:01:42.255 --> 1:01:44.296
<i>Our unit has to reactivate
Hangzhou 01 Earth Engine.</i>

1:01:44.588 --> 1:01:47.046
<i>Does anyone copy? Please reply!</i>

1:01:49.380 --> 1:01:52.838
Fortunately, you guys showed up.

1:01:54.796 --> 1:01:57.171
<i>Han Ziang. Senior driver.</i>

1:01:57.338 --> 1:02:00.171
<i>Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division
reminds you.</i>

1:02:00.713 --> 1:02:02.213
<i>Routes are countless.</i>

1:02:02.296 --> 1:02:03.963
<i>Safety is the priority.</i>

1:02:04.046 --> 1:02:05.671
<i>With unregulated driving,</i>

1:02:05.796 --> 1:02:07.671
<i>your loved ones might end up in tears.</i>

1:02:33.505 --> 1:02:34.338
Boss,

1:02:35.171 --> 1:02:36.838
Hangzhou underground city is destroyed.

1:02:49.088 --> 1:02:49.963
Huang Ming!

1:02:52.088 --> 1:02:53.546
Unload the battery pack.

1:03:00.005 --> 1:03:01.296
Poor kid.

1:03:01.463 --> 1:03:03.005
He froze to death.

1:03:04.296 --> 1:03:05.713
Huang Ming!

1:03:09.213 --> 1:03:11.421
Check the status of the Lighter Core,
and keep moving.

1:03:11.505 --> 1:03:13.088
-Boss!
-Boss! We no longer have a target!

1:03:13.171 --> 1:03:15.171
-Keep moving, am I clear?
-What's the point?

1:03:15.255 --> 1:03:17.546
This Lighter Core is the hope
of 350,000 people in Hangzhou.

1:03:17.630 --> 1:03:18.921
But they are dead now.

1:03:29.671 --> 1:03:30.921
Zhou Qian!

1:03:31.505 --> 1:03:32.546
No more death!

1:03:33.588 --> 1:03:34.880
Yes, no more death.

1:03:35.380 --> 1:03:37.880
But Han Ziang, Gang Zi, Huang Ming

1:03:37.963 --> 1:03:40.880
and all the other members
of our rescue unit had died in vain.

1:03:40.963 --> 1:03:42.796
There are 3.5 billion people
who live on Earth.

1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:44.880
Even my wife and child!
They all died in vain!

1:03:46.713 --> 1:03:47.921
Boss.

1:04:42.130 --> 1:04:43.046
This...

1:04:46.713 --> 1:04:48.088
Buddy.

1:04:48.421 --> 1:04:49.421
Think carefully.

1:04:49.921 --> 1:04:51.755
It's our only chance to go home.

1:04:54.671 --> 1:04:55.546
What?

1:04:55.630 --> 1:04:56.880
No one is forcing you.

1:04:57.546 --> 1:04:59.171
You can switch with them anytime.

1:05:04.921 --> 1:05:08.046
Attention to all members
of rescue unit CN171-11.

1:05:08.463 --> 1:05:09.963
<i>Rescue mission has failed.</i>

1:05:10.046 --> 1:05:11.671
<i>Disband unit now.</i>

1:05:14.421 --> 1:05:15.463
<i>All of you</i>

1:05:16.380 --> 1:05:17.796
<i>may return home.</i>

1:05:19.296 --> 1:05:20.588
Boss, where are you going?

1:05:29.380 --> 1:05:31.380
There's a Lighter Core onboard.

1:05:32.088 --> 1:05:34.505
<i>Rescue unit CN171-11.</i>

1:05:34.921 --> 1:05:35.921
<i>Please assist us</i>

1:05:36.255 --> 1:05:37.546
<i>to rescue Sulawesi.</i>

1:05:53.796 --> 1:05:56.963
Everyone, our mission is to restart
Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

1:05:57.046 --> 1:05:59.463
Only a handful of Lighter Cores
can make it to the equator now.

1:05:59.546 --> 1:06:01.130
The survival of Earth is counting on us.

1:06:01.421 --> 1:06:03.671
Who are you? Where did you come from?

1:06:04.296 --> 1:06:05.255
Li Yiyi.

1:06:05.505 --> 1:06:07.296
Emergency technical observer of UEG.

1:06:08.171 --> 1:06:10.171
Such a high rank for someone so young.

1:06:16.088 --> 1:06:17.213
When this is over,

1:06:18.171 --> 1:06:19.296
I will get back at you

1:06:19.671 --> 1:06:20.963
for what you did to my grandpa.

1:06:30.671 --> 1:06:33.505
Head South. We're going to Sulawesi.

1:06:59.505 --> 1:07:01.463
Man, I've got to correct you.

1:07:01.713 --> 1:07:03.171
It will take more than 2,500 years

1:07:03.255 --> 1:07:05.005
for the frozen Lake Baikal to liquefy.

1:07:05.088 --> 1:07:06.296
That's okay.

1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:08.046
We have children,

1:07:08.713 --> 1:07:10.421
and their children will have children.

1:07:11.421 --> 1:07:12.380
There'll be a day

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:14.338
when ice turns into water.

1:07:16.963 --> 1:07:20.755
There's another 20 to 30 meters
till A3 intersection.

1:07:24.505 --> 1:07:27.088
Look! A1 intersection exploded.

1:07:27.921 --> 1:07:30.796
Maybe there are others
who discovered about the desertion too.

1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:33.963
And they are also trying to make their way
to the central control module.

1:07:34.838 --> 1:07:35.963
Makarov, stay close to me.

1:07:36.046 --> 1:07:37.963
Hurry! Climb quickly!

1:07:43.546 --> 1:07:44.463
Watch out.

1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:55.005
Mom!

1:07:55.838 --> 1:07:58.213
Mom, I want to go home!

1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:08.713
Liu Peiqiang!

1:08:08.921 --> 1:08:11.380
Just one more cabin till A3 intersection.

1:08:11.463 --> 1:08:12.546
Let's jump.

1:08:14.588 --> 1:08:16.130
The central control module is coming.

1:08:17.546 --> 1:08:18.963
Jump!

1:08:37.255 --> 1:08:38.588
Grab me! Makarov!

1:08:40.171 --> 1:08:41.505
Makarov!

1:08:53.046 --> 1:08:53.880
<i>Liu.</i>

1:08:55.005 --> 1:08:57.005
<i>I do believe in your words.</i>

1:08:57.671 --> 1:08:59.546
<i>There will be a day</i>

1:09:00.213 --> 1:09:02.171
<i>when ice turns into water.</i>

1:09:03.088 --> 1:09:05.505
<i>That's when we will take our children</i>

1:09:06.463 --> 1:09:08.630
<i>to go salmon fishing.</i>

1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:11.588

<i>Every action of the space station is legal</i>

<i>and is fully authorized by the UEG.</i>

1:10:49.796 --> 1:10:51.463
<i>MOSS never deserted.</i>

1:10:51.838 --> 1:10:54.796
<i>It's only faithfully executing
authorized orders.</i>

1:11:11.463 --> 1:11:13.338
We will cross the Terminator soon.

1:11:13.421 --> 1:11:14.505
Once crossed,

1:11:15.671 --> 1:11:16.755
it's the dark side of Earth.

<i>Except for Sulawesi Engines.</i>

1:11:51.755 --> 1:11:53.546
<i>We will replenish

1:11:57.630 --> 1:11:58.463
Okay.

1:11:58.546 --> 1:12:01.005
Five minutes until top up.

1:12:04.296 --> 1:12:05.921
That's a big fellow.

1:12:06.130 --> 1:12:07.005
Is that a whale?

1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:10.088
Maybe.

1:12:11.796 --> 1:12:13.338
Why is it here?

1:12:14.171 --> 1:12:15.338
It had swum this far.

1:12:15.421 --> 1:12:16.963
It must have been heading home.

1:12:18.171 --> 1:12:19.213
Heading home?

1:12:20.296 --> 1:12:21.630
Once the mission is completed,

1:12:21.796 --> 1:12:23.671
you can reunite with your dad.

1:12:25.171 --> 1:12:26.130
When I was a child,

1:12:26.213 --> 1:12:27.588
he told me that

1:12:27.671 --> 1:12:29.463
he would be a star in the sky,

1:12:30.505 --> 1:12:32.588
that whenever I lift my head,
I'd be able to see him.

1:12:34.213 --> 1:12:36.755
Later, I realized it was all lies.

1:12:36.838 --> 1:12:37.796
In Beijing,

1:12:39.046 --> 1:12:40.921
it is impossible to see the stars.

1:12:42.588 --> 1:12:44.421
Actually, in my heart,

1:12:46.088 --> 1:12:48.713
that star no longer exists.

1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:51.255
<i>Grandpa told me</i>

1:12:51.380 --> 1:12:52.505

<i>I will be</i>

1:12:58.588 --> 1:12:59.838
taking Duoduo home.

1:13:04.505 --> 1:13:06.005
Earth Engines have restarted.

1:13:07.130 --> 1:13:08.213
<i>It's a saturated rescue.</i>

1:13:08.463 --> 1:13:10.005
<i>Other units have been ahead of us.</i>

1:13:16.713 --> 1:13:17.921
Have we succeeded?

1:13:18.171 --> 1:13:19.838
These are the last remaining
Torque Engines.

1:13:19.921 --> 1:13:21.296
All have been restarted.

1:13:26.546 --> 1:13:27.588
We did it.

1:13:31.088 --> 1:13:32.588
<i>Once the readings rise back to normal,</i>

1:13:32.755 --> 1:13:34.546
<i>we can all go home.</i>

1:13:37.255 --> 1:13:39.005
The distance to Jupiter
is still decreasing.

1:13:44.380 --> 1:13:47.963
<i>Only 0.42 second after activating
Emergency Protocol No. 3,</i>

1:13:48.130 --> 1:13:50.630
<i>MOSS had already deduced
every possible outcome.</i>

1:13:51.213 --> 1:13:53.171
<i>The UEG was informed,</i>

1:13:53.296 --> 1:13:55.671
<i>but still chose to perform
this rescue mission,</i>

1:13:55.755 --> 1:13:59.171
<i>which was predetermined to be futile.</i>

1:13:59.463 --> 1:14:03.463
<i>The evacuation of space station indicated
that the rescue mission has failed.</i>

1:14:07.796 --> 1:14:09.171
<i>After three hours,</i>

1:14:09.255 --> 1:14:12.588
<i>the Earth will breach
Jupiter's Roche limit</i>

1:14:12.671 --> 1:14:15.338
<i>and begin the inevitable

1:14:15.838 --> 1:14:18.463
<i>MOSS will broadcast globally.</i>

1:14:18.588 --> 1:14:19.671

<i>In the past 36 hours,</i>

1:14:40.130 --> 1:14:43.713
<i>mankind experienced the biggest threat
to human survival.</i>

1:14:45.088 --> 1:14:49.088
<i>Over 1.5 million rescue personnel
fought and sacrificed around the globe.</i>

1:14:49.588 --> 1:14:51.796
<i>As a result, 71% of Propulsion Engines</i>

1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:54.296
<i>and 100% of Torque Engines</i>

1:14:54.380 --> 1:14:55.963

<i>the Jupiter's gravitational pull</i>

1:15:00.671 --> 1:15:03.421
<i>has surpassed the combined power

<i>The Earth has missed</i>

<i>End of broadcasting.</i>

1:16:11.130 --> 1:16:12.505
<i>Farewell.</i>

1:16:14.046 --> 1:16:15.796
Hu Kou, I want to go home.

1:16:21.171 --> 1:16:24.171
What seven days?

1:16:25.380 --> 1:16:28.338
Within a day,
our atmosphere would be drained empty.

1:16:28.421 --> 1:16:31.130
Everyone will die of asphyxiation.

1:16:31.213 --> 1:16:34.171
What seven days?

1:16:34.671 --> 1:16:35.963
Members of the rescue unit

1:16:36.546 --> 1:16:38.588
CN171-11, move onboard.

1:16:41.921 --> 1:16:42.963
Be ready to evacuate.

1:16:43.463 --> 1:16:45.588
Screw you, damn Jupiter!

1:16:45.671 --> 1:16:47.088
Screw you!

1:16:53.255 --> 1:16:55.255
<i>Please get ready,

1:16:55.338 --> 1:16:58.671
<i>MOSS will assist you

Code 5711 6231 0501.

1:17:13.213 --> 1:17:14.963
Let me speak to my son one last time.

1:17:22.796 --> 1:17:24.421
<i>Liu Qi is not in his designated area.</i>

1:17:24.505 --> 1:17:25.963
<i>The connection is unavailable.</i>

1:17:26.046 --> 1:17:27.838
<i>Han Ziang is not

1:17:27.921 --> 1:17:29.005
<i>Connection is unavailable.</i>

1:17:29.088 --> 1:17:30.880
<i>Wang Lei is not
at his designated transporter.</i>

1:17:30.963 --> 1:17:32.296
<i>The connection is unavailable.</i>

1:17:32.380 --> 1:17:34.463
<i>The contact with Transporter 373 was lost.</i>

1:17:34.838 --> 1:17:36.880
<i>Its last transmission was
from Shanghai area.</i>

1:17:38.421 --> 1:17:41.130
<i>I can no longer recall your face,
you bastard.</i>

1:17:42.796 --> 1:17:44.505
<i>Jupiter is right in front of me.</i>

1:17:45.921 --> 1:17:47.213
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

1:17:48.796 --> 1:17:51.588
<i>Since the day that
the Wandering Earth Project was started,</i>

1:17:52.588 --> 1:17:54.046
<i>there was no turning back.</i>

1:18:03.755 --> 1:18:04.921
Look!

1:18:05.005 --> 1:18:05.838
It's Jupiter!

1:18:06.463 --> 1:18:08.380
<i>The largest planet in the Solar System.</i>

1:18:08.588 --> 1:18:11.546
<i>Dad, there is an eye on Jupiter.</i>

1:18:11.630 --> 1:18:12.963
<i>That's not an eye.</i>

1:18:13.421 --> 1:18:15.296
<i>That's a huge windstorm on Jupiter.</i>

1:18:17.005 --> 1:18:18.046
<i>Jupiter</i>

1:18:18.546 --> 1:18:20.088
<i>is like a huge balloon,</i>

1:18:23.338 --> 1:18:24.713
composed of 90%...

1:18:24.796 --> 1:18:25.838
<i>Hydrogen!</i>

1:18:34.296 --> 1:18:35.213
Li Yiyi.

1:18:35.713 --> 1:18:38.296
The mix of Jupiter's and Earth's
atmosphere, is it combustible?

1:18:43.463 --> 1:18:46.463
By now, Jupiter has siphoned
at least 30 billion liters of oxygen.

1:18:46.546 --> 1:18:48.963
The combustion shockwave
will be over 1,000 Mach.

1:18:49.088 --> 1:18:50.130
<i>The generated force will</i>

1:18:50.213 --> 1:18:51.588
<i>be sufficient to push Earth away.</i>

1:18:51.671 --> 1:18:54.421
A hydrogen-oxygen mixture will be
combustible with just a single match.

1:18:54.505 --> 1:18:56.046
All we need now is a match.

1:18:56.463 --> 1:18:58.005
No, the distance between both planets

1:18:58.088 --> 1:18:59.588
is over 70,000km.

1:18:59.671 --> 1:19:02.421
Even an intercontinental ballistic missile
can't reach that far!

1:19:03.171 --> 1:19:04.046
Li Yiyi.

1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:05.963
What about this match?

1:19:06.046 --> 1:19:07.130
What match?

1:19:14.171 --> 1:19:16.130
I can modify the engine's operating system

1:19:16.755 --> 1:19:18.130
to blast the beam much higher!

1:19:21.255 --> 1:19:24.088
Wang Lei, Jupiter's combustion shockwave

1:19:24.171 --> 1:19:25.671
can propel Earth out from Jupiter.

1:19:27.463 --> 1:19:28.588
I am listening.

1:19:29.213 --> 1:19:30.046
Don't yell.

1:19:30.130 --> 1:19:32.880
Come on. Let's ignite Jupiter!

1:19:35.130 --> 1:19:37.338
That's kamikaze.

1:19:38.046 --> 1:19:40.671
It's better than waiting to die.

1:19:41.046 --> 1:19:42.380
Is there anyone who wants to quit?

1:20:00.671 --> 1:20:03.880
<i>The Helios Project's
evacuation procedure is initiated.</i>

1:20:18.796 --> 1:20:20.005
<i>All rescue units...</i>

1:20:20.088 --> 1:20:22.296
<i>All rescue units are evacuating.</i>

1:20:22.588 --> 1:20:25.338
<i>Calling Navigation Platform International
Space Station. Do you copy?</i>

1:20:25.838 --> 1:20:28.505
Repeat, calling Navigation Platform
International Space Station.

1:20:28.588 --> 1:20:29.921
We have a new plan.

1:20:30.546 --> 1:20:31.463
Please respond.

1:20:31.963 --> 1:20:33.546
All communications have been shielded.

1:20:34.380 --> 1:20:35.421
Attention, everyone.

1:20:35.505 --> 1:20:36.630
We only got 30 minutes.

1:20:36.713 --> 1:20:38.255
This mission has three steps.

1:20:38.338 --> 1:20:39.963
Step one. Shut the engine down

1:20:40.046 --> 1:20:41.213
to gain control.

1:20:42.796 --> 1:20:44.463
There are seven nozzles
in an Earth Engine.

1:20:44.546 --> 1:20:47.546
I'll shut down the engine temporarily
and direct all energy into one nozzle

1:20:47.630 --> 1:20:48.880
to generate a plasma beam that

1:20:48.963 --> 1:20:50.005
would reach high enough.

1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:52.963
Does anyone recall
the famous <i>12 Chimes of Spring</i>?

1:20:55.380 --> 1:20:56.296
I wrote that program.

1:20:57.088 --> 1:20:59.255
<i>-Happy New Year!</i>
<i>-Happy New Year!</i>

1:21:01.005 --> 1:21:02.296
-That was you--
-Boring, I know.

1:21:02.380 --> 1:21:04.088
I'm going to use it
to override the system.

1:21:04.171 --> 1:21:05.296
So that we can take control.

1:21:05.880 --> 1:21:07.380
Step two. Once we override the system,

1:21:07.463 --> 1:21:10.630
the auto unlock mechanism wouldn't work.
So it has to be unlocked manually.

1:21:10.713 --> 1:21:14.880
Captain Wang, Antennae,
Scarface, and Band-Aid.

1:21:16.796 --> 1:21:17.921
My name is--

1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:20.921
The manual unlocking task
depends on you guys.

1:21:22.630 --> 1:21:25.880
Lastly, load the Lighter Core
into the reaction chamber

1:21:25.963 --> 1:21:27.130
and reignite the Earth Engine.

1:21:29.130 --> 1:21:29.963
IGNITION DURATION

1:21:30.588 --> 1:21:33.255
Blast the plasma beam 70,000km
into space and ignite Jupiter.

1:21:33.338 --> 1:21:36.380
The combustion shockwave will travel along
the atmospheric transference,

1:21:36.463 --> 1:21:38.630
like "boom," to propel Earth away.
Get it for me, please.

1:21:38.713 --> 1:21:42.046
Liu Qi, you'll drive the Lighter Core
to the reaction chamber.

1:21:42.130 --> 1:21:43.713
The installation procedure

1:21:43.796 --> 1:21:45.255
is basically automatic.

1:21:45.338 --> 1:21:47.671
Chinese man, you go with him.

1:21:47.755 --> 1:21:49.046
Why am I involved?

1:21:49.130 --> 1:21:50.421
Are you kidding?

1:21:50.505 --> 1:21:53.255
Installing a Lighter Core requires
a minimum of 13 months training.

1:21:53.338 --> 1:21:54.713
You're welcome to take his place.

1:21:56.380 --> 1:21:57.671
Once the mission is accomplished,

1:21:57.755 --> 1:21:59.838
all head to
the underground city immediately.

1:21:59.921 --> 1:22:02.380
Bear in mind. It will be a very,

1:22:04.088 --> 1:22:05.213
very...

1:22:06.505 --> 1:22:07.463
humongous wave.

1:22:09.005 --> 1:22:10.296
We'll either make it or break it.

1:22:10.380 --> 1:22:12.255
Assignment completed. Any questions?

1:22:12.338 --> 1:22:13.338
I...

1:22:13.838 --> 1:22:14.755
Excellent.

1:22:16.963 --> 1:22:18.546
Hey.

1:22:20.171 --> 1:22:23.880
Over there. It's the control center.

1:22:29.130 --> 1:22:31.046
<i>Attention, all evacuating rescue units.</i>

1:22:31.130 --> 1:22:32.088
<i>We need your assistance.</i>

1:22:32.171 --> 1:22:33.671
<i>Please slow down and stop.</i>

1:22:33.755 --> 1:22:34.963
<i>We need your support.</i>

1:22:35.046 --> 1:22:36.630
<i>Please slow down and stop.</i>

1:22:45.255 --> 1:22:47.838
Looks like we are on our own now.

1:22:51.880 --> 1:22:53.296
Oh, mighty Newton.

1:22:53.380 --> 1:22:55.130
Enlighted Einstein.

1:22:55.505 --> 1:22:56.838
Holy Hawking.

1:22:56.921 --> 1:22:58.296
Also Amitabha Buddha.

1:22:58.380 --> 1:22:59.880
Gang Zi will bless us.

1:23:01.130 --> 1:23:02.671
I learned the installation procedure

1:23:03.546 --> 1:23:04.921
at my internship.

1:23:06.213 --> 1:23:08.630
Don't forget, your brother is a genius.

1:23:44.421 --> 1:23:46.338
Wait. We're executing
an emergency mission.

1:23:46.421 --> 1:23:47.505
We need your help.

1:23:48.588 --> 1:23:49.838
Fuck! Are you blind?

1:23:49.921 --> 1:23:51.255
There's nothing left!

1:23:51.338 --> 1:23:53.088
-We need to leave!
-Please help us!

1:23:53.213 --> 1:23:55.046
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

1:23:58.380 --> 1:23:59.755
Over here!

1:24:00.713 --> 1:24:03.838
Captain Wang. We're counting on you guys.

1:24:03.921 --> 1:24:06.963
Don't worry. Zhou Qian, take Duoduo
upstairs to contact for reinforcement.

1:24:07.046 --> 1:24:08.088
Roger that.

1:24:08.755 --> 1:24:11.046
Duoduo, let's go.

1:24:40.088 --> 1:24:41.630
The Earth Engine has been shut down.

1:24:45.546 --> 1:24:47.796
Guys, let's hit it!

1:24:49.338 --> 1:24:51.130
<i>It's fully automatic!
What are you reading?</i>

1:24:51.213 --> 1:24:53.296
<i>Why is the manual so thick
if it's automatic?</i>

1:24:54.338 --> 1:24:55.671
What are you up to?

1:24:57.546 --> 1:24:59.296
I'd better delve into it.

1:24:59.380 --> 1:25:02.213
The colors of wire cores are not random.
Red, white, blue, orange. All in sequence.

1:25:02.380 --> 1:25:03.671
But everything is in grey.

1:25:04.588 --> 1:25:07.213
This is for transporter's broadcast.
This is for connecting up there.

1:25:07.338 --> 1:25:08.755
Press to speak.

1:25:08.963 --> 1:25:11.171
-What's up there?
-Space station.

1:25:16.046 --> 1:25:17.005
Come on. Next.

1:25:18.130 --> 1:25:20.588
Uploading Trojan <i>12 Chimes of Spring</i>.

1:25:20.671 --> 1:25:21.671
UPLOADING

1:25:45.671 --> 1:25:48.171
We're Chinese rescue unit CN171-11.

1:25:48.255 --> 1:25:50.213
<i>Current location,
Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.</i>

1:25:50.296 --> 1:25:52.755
<i>We're executing our last rescue mission.
We request support.</i>

1:25:52.838 --> 1:25:55.255
-Why are these people still trying?
<i>-We request support.</i>

1:25:55.338 --> 1:25:57.755
It's a waste of time. Don't bother.

1:25:59.005 --> 1:26:01.796
We're the rescue unit CN171-11.

1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:03.880
<i>We have a new plan.</i>

1:26:03.963 --> 1:26:05.421
Calling for reinforcement!

1:26:07.921 --> 1:26:10.088
<i>We're the rescue unit CN171-11.</i>

1:26:10.171 --> 1:26:12.755
-I'm craving for miso soup.
-<i>We still have the last rescue mission.</i>

1:26:12.838 --> 1:26:15.796
-Would be great if there's a bowl of rice.
-<i>We request support.</i>

1:26:17.755 --> 1:26:18.921
<i>We're done with the last one.</i>

1:26:19.005 --> 1:26:20.213
What's next?

1:26:20.338 --> 1:26:21.338
One moment.

1:26:21.421 --> 1:26:23.130
It should be fully automatic.

1:26:25.005 --> 1:26:26.588
The next step is manual labor.

1:26:26.671 --> 1:26:29.213
The program he wrote
lacks the percussion pin procedure.

1:26:33.838 --> 1:26:35.171
<i>You call this</i>

1:26:36.255 --> 1:26:37.380
<i>a pin?</i>

1:26:39.796 --> 1:26:41.296
No rescue units responding.

1:26:41.380 --> 1:26:42.588
<i>Nobody is responding.</i>

1:27:09.171 --> 1:27:11.213
What is Error 425?

1:27:11.296 --> 1:27:12.838
What does it mean?

1:27:12.921 --> 1:27:13.880
Li Yiyi!

1:27:13.963 --> 1:27:15.838
How is it fully automatic?

1:27:15.921 --> 1:27:18.505
Haven't I handed the manual to you?
It's for errors like this.

1:27:18.588 --> 1:27:22.005
-What is Error 425?
-Read it yourself.

1:27:26.338 --> 1:27:30.213
<i>-Warning, Han Ziang illegally operating...</i>
-Li Yiyi, you are nuts.

1:27:32.296 --> 1:27:34.463
Tim, helmet on!

1:27:34.546 --> 1:27:36.671
-Wait a moment.
-Forget about it!

1:27:50.505 --> 1:27:51.755
What's next?

1:27:51.838 --> 1:27:54.838
<i>Fully automatic.
It says it's fully automatic.</i>

1:28:07.046 --> 1:28:09.171
Why is it stuck here?

1:28:12.338 --> 1:28:15.088
Without any hardware tweak,
you'll be hacking shit! Let me pass.

1:28:15.171 --> 1:28:16.380
Hu Kou, where are you?

1:28:16.463 --> 1:28:17.880
I'm not getting any response.

1:28:18.046 --> 1:28:19.130
There's enough space behind.

1:28:19.255 --> 1:28:20.880
More stylish crossing in front of you!

1:28:20.963 --> 1:28:22.505
You have too much time.

1:28:30.046 --> 1:28:31.380
This freaking door is jammed.

1:28:32.630 --> 1:28:33.921
Here.

1:28:46.213 --> 1:28:48.296
<i>How can you fix it
without a contingency diagram?</i>

1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:49.505
Shut up! Let me concentrate!

1:28:49.588 --> 1:28:51.796
The jumpers here
haven't been touched in decades.

1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:54.046
With one mistake, it's game over.

1:29:00.796 --> 1:29:03.421
SON, IT'S COLD.
DON'T FORGET YOUR LONG JOHNS. MOM

1:29:20.255 --> 1:29:22.130
Li Yiyi, the igniter is ready.

1:29:23.005 --> 1:29:25.046
No. It is displaying
installation incomplete.

1:29:25.130 --> 1:29:26.505
Looks like it's almost done.

1:29:32.588 --> 1:29:33.463
EMERGENCY EXIT

1:29:38.171 --> 1:29:39.338
<i>Liu Qi!</i>

1:29:41.005 --> 1:29:42.505
Liu Qi! Are you crazy?

1:29:42.588 --> 1:29:43.796
Save your nonsense.

1:29:44.296 --> 1:29:45.296
Get out and help.

1:29:45.671 --> 1:29:48.171
<i>Warning. Temperature regulator is failing.</i>

1:29:57.046 --> 1:29:58.088
<i>Overload.</i>

1:29:58.171 --> 1:30:00.671
<i>Only 30% of energy remaining.</i>

1:31:02.296 --> 1:31:03.713
Are both of you all right?

1:31:03.963 --> 1:31:04.880
Band-Aid.

1:31:05.088 --> 1:31:06.671
Duoduo? Can you move?

1:31:07.796 --> 1:31:10.463
One, two, three, hold on.

1:31:12.963 --> 1:31:14.213
Liu Qi.

1:31:15.338 --> 1:31:17.338
Have you found the problem?

1:31:18.088 --> 1:31:19.546
It's stuck inside.

1:31:23.130 --> 1:31:24.630
Li Yiyi.

1:31:24.713 --> 1:31:26.463
Go on. Go!

1:31:28.088 --> 1:31:28.963
Duoduo, leave me here.

1:31:29.796 --> 1:31:31.671
Hurry up and evacuate
to the underground city.

1:31:33.213 --> 1:31:34.338
<i>Warning! Overheat!</i>

1:31:34.421 --> 1:31:36.380
<i>Thermal suit is low in power.</i>

1:31:37.213 --> 1:31:38.046
<i>Warning! Overheat!</i>

1:31:38.713 --> 1:31:41.296
Liu Qi! You'll be squeezed to death!

1:31:55.255 --> 1:31:57.130
Help!

1:31:58.338 --> 1:32:01.005
<i>Can anyone help us?</i>

1:32:02.171 --> 1:32:04.838
<i>Can anyone help us?</i>

1:32:24.338 --> 1:32:25.630
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.</i>

1:32:25.713 --> 1:32:28.421
<i>Please follow MOSS' instructions,

1:32:28.505 --> 1:32:29.671
<i>Uncle Liu Peiqiang.</i>

1:32:30.171 --> 1:32:31.463
<i>It's Han Duoduo.</i>

1:32:31.546 --> 1:32:33.338
<i>We still have one last hope.</i>

1:32:33.671 --> 1:32:35.880
Duoduo? Are you okay?

1:32:35.963 --> 1:32:36.963
<i>Is Liu Qi still there?</i>

1:32:37.380 --> 1:32:41.005
We are all here.
We are at Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine.

1:32:42.171 --> 1:32:43.421
<i>We will ignite Jupiter</i>

1:32:43.505 --> 1:32:44.338
<i>to propel Earth away.</i>

1:32:44.421 --> 1:32:45.588
We need reinforcement.

1:32:46.338 --> 1:32:49.338
<i>Unfortunately, seven hours ago,</i>

1:32:49.421 --> 1:32:51.713
<i>this plan was already proposed
by the Israeli scientists.</i>

1:32:52.338 --> 1:32:53.755
<i>The probability of success is zero.</i>

1:32:54.255 --> 1:32:55.338
Don't worry, Duoduo.

1:32:55.963 --> 1:32:57.630
I will try to contact the UEG.

1:33:01.796 --> 1:33:04.755
<i>-Details of the plan have been uploaded.
-Synchronous translation is on.</i>

1:33:06.255 --> 1:33:07.963
<i>This is the United Earth Government,</i>

1:33:08.213 --> 1:33:10.046
<i>state your identity immediately</i>

1:33:10.546 --> 1:33:12.296
<i>to acknowledge this transmission.</i>

1:33:15.296 --> 1:33:16.588
United Earth Government,

1:33:16.671 --> 1:33:18.296
I'm Chinese astronaut Liu Peiqiang.

1:33:18.921 --> 1:33:20.296
Please send a global order now

1:33:20.463 --> 1:33:23.296
to deploy all rescue units in the vicinity
of Sulawesi for reinforcements.

1:33:24.463 --> 1:33:25.713
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Liu Peiqiang.</i>

1:33:26.213 --> 1:33:29.380
<i>During these last moments

1:33:38.046 --> 1:33:39.921
<i>we cannot pass down.</i>

1:33:47.130 --> 1:33:48.088
Today,

1:33:49.171 --> 1:33:50.755
it's the first day of Chinese New Year.

1:33:52.838 --> 1:33:54.546
It was meant to be a day of reunion.

1:33:57.296 --> 1:33:58.505
As a father,

1:33:58.755 --> 1:34:00.755
I don't want this to be the last reunion.

1:34:01.588 --> 1:34:02.838
I refuse to give up.

1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:06.671
There is nothing to lose.

1:34:08.380 --> 1:34:09.755
For the sake of our children,

1:34:11.713 --> 1:34:12.796
I beg you.

1:34:16.255 --> 1:34:17.630
<i>As the United Earth Government,</i>

1:34:17.713 --> 1:34:19.796
<i>we cannot accept your request.</i>

1:34:20.088 --> 1:34:21.296
<i>However,</i>

1:34:21.380 --> 1:34:22.838
<i>as a private individual,</i>

1:34:23.463 --> 1:34:26.338
<i>I will connect the rescue unit
to the global broadcasting system.</i>

1:34:27.463 --> 1:34:28.838
<i>And the rest</i>

1:34:28.921 --> 1:34:31.588
<i>will be up to the will of each individual.</i>

1:34:41.421 --> 1:34:44.338
<i>Hello, people from every rescue unit.</i>

1:34:45.463 --> 1:34:47.046
<i>My name is Han Duoduo.</i>

1:34:47.713 --> 1:34:49.671
<i>I'm a junior high school student.</i>

1:34:51.338 --> 1:34:55.255
Our rescue unit is
executing our final mission.

1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:58.380
Right now, I'm extremely terrified.

1:34:59.088 --> 1:35:01.171
<i>My legs are trembling.</i>

1:35:02.171 --> 1:35:04.505
<i>Everybody is doing their best,</i>

1:35:05.421 --> 1:35:07.463
<i>but there is nothing I can do to help!</i>

1:35:08.755 --> 1:35:10.630
Yesterday, my teacher asked us.

1:35:10.713 --> 1:35:12.463
<i>"What is hope?"</i>

1:35:13.213 --> 1:35:14.588
<i>In the past,</i>

1:35:15.046 --> 1:35:18.255
<i>I never believed in hope.</i>

1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:20.713
But now I do.

1:35:21.213 --> 1:35:23.671
I believe that in our time,

1:35:24.338 --> 1:35:27.755
<i>hope is precious like a diamond.</i>

1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:29.963
<i>Hope.</i>

1:35:30.588 --> 1:35:34.005
<i>Hope is the way to guide us home.</i>

1:35:35.088 --> 1:35:37.380
Please come back and fight together!

1:35:37.880 --> 1:35:40.755
Ignite Jupiter! Save our Earth!

1:35:42.171 --> 1:35:45.588
We are at Sulawesi 03 Torque Engine,

1:35:45.671 --> 1:35:47.505
under the command of Captain Wang Lei.

1:35:48.588 --> 1:35:51.255
Chinese rescue unit CN171-11.

1:35:51.630 --> 1:35:52.671
Han Duoduo.

1:35:53.171 --> 1:35:54.338
End of broadcast.

1:35:55.671 --> 1:35:57.796
<i>The global broadcast is over.</i>

1:36:00.755 --> 1:36:03.380
I want to go home

1:36:05.296 --> 1:36:06.755
to see my mother.

1:36:07.588 --> 1:36:09.296
When the Earth is destroyed,

1:36:10.005 --> 1:36:12.963
there will be nobody left to see!

1:36:13.588 --> 1:36:14.838
We're turning back!

1:36:21.421 --> 1:36:23.963
We're unlikely to make it home
within seven days.

1:36:24.046 --> 1:36:27.130
Why are we returning then?

1:36:52.963 --> 1:36:54.005
Coordinate located.

1:36:54.088 --> 1:36:56.630
Communication frequency channel 055 0311.

1:36:56.963 --> 1:36:59.171
Connecting to Sulawesi 03
secondary communication network.

1:36:59.255 --> 1:37:00.421
Covering the entire frequency.

1:37:00.505 --> 1:37:02.088
Sharing the plan for engine overriding.

1:37:02.171 --> 1:37:03.963

<i>-We need more time to discuss it.</i>

1:42:44.213 --> 1:42:45.546
A civilization without lives

1:46:30.796 --> 1:46:32.255
Dad is going on a mission again.

This is the most important mission

1:56:50.463 --> 1:56:51.671
I'm all set and ready to go!

1:56:51.796 --> 1:56:53.130
If there is no accident,

1:56:54.921 --> 1:56:56.505
<i>-Phase three. The Earth</i>
-in three hours...

1:56:56.588 --> 1:57:00.505
<i>will use the gravitational force of the
Sun and Jupiter for final acceleration,</i>

1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:01.796
<i>embarking on</i>

1:57:02.171 --> 1:57:03.046
<i>a voyage of wandering.</i>

1:57:03.130 --> 1:57:04.213
Will your sister come along?

1:57:05.505 --> 1:57:06.421
Screw you!

1:57:08.088 --> 1:57:09.213
After all these years,

1:57:10.088 --> 1:57:11.213
you're still the same.

1:57:13.338 --> 1:57:14.296
<i>Phase four.</i>

1:57:14.671 --> 1:57:18.546
<i>When the Earth leaves the Solar System,
the Earth Engines will turn on full power,</i>

1:57:19.005 --> 1:57:22.671
<i>spending 500 years to accelerate
to 0.5% of the speed of light.</i>

1:57:22.838 --> 1:57:24.546
<i>then it will glide for 1,300 years.</i>

1:57:25.463 --> 1:57:28.171
<i>After that,
reversing Earth Engines' directions,</i>

1:57:28.463 --> 1:57:29.755
<i>it will spend another 700 years</i>

1:57:29.963 --> 1:57:31.005
<i>in deceleration.</i>

1:57:36.088 --> 1:57:36.921
Liu Hu Kou!

1:57:37.005 --> 1:57:38.171
Where have you been?

1:57:38.838 --> 1:57:40.255
Why is Li Yiyi here too?

1:57:41.213 --> 1:57:42.171
<i>Phase five.</i>

1:57:42.255 --> 1:57:44.421
<i>Earth will begin to berth
at the targeted stellar system,</i>

1:57:44.546 --> 1:57:45.838
<i>arriving at our new home</i>

1:57:46.171 --> 1:57:48.755
<i>and becoming a new planet
of the targeted stellar system.</i>

1:57:48.838 --> 1:57:52.630
Don't you dare call me Hu Kou.
Where are your manners?

1:57:54.171 --> 1:57:55.088
Call me "Brother."

1:57:55.463 --> 1:57:56.463
<i>Liu Qi.</i>

1:57:56.880 --> 1:57:58.713
<i>Junior driver.</i>

<i>Beijing No. 3 Transportation Division
reminds you.</i>

1:58:02.546 --> 1:58:04.463
<i>Routes are countless.</i>

1:58:04.796 --> 1:58:06.755
<i>Safety is the priority.</i>

1:58:07.338 --> 1:58:08.921
<i>With unregulated driving,</i>

1:58:09.213 --> 1:58:11.421
<i>your loved ones might end up in tears.</i>

1:58:15.421 --> 1:58:16.463
<i>Driving rules violated.</i>

1:58:16.546 --> 1:58:18.463
<i>-Deduct three points.
-Can you drive? Liu Hu Kou!</i>

1:58:19.046 --> 1:58:21.880
<i>Li Yiyi! You're distracting my vision
with that bag!</i>

1:58:22.171 --> 1:58:24.546
<i>It's my fault?</i>

1:58:25.588 --> 1:58:28.505
<i>How am I blocking your vision
when I'm sitting behind you?</i>

1:58:28.963 --> 1:58:31.213
<i>This project will last
for 100 generations.</i>

1:58:31.296 --> 1:58:33.546
<i>-Be careful, someone is there.
-Shit, what's going on?</i>

1:58:33.755 --> 1:58:37.088
<i>We are unaware of what
the new Sun at 4.2 light years away</i>

1:58:37.171 --> 1:58:38.505
<i>will bring to our new home though.</i>

1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:42.296
<i>But from this day on,
the courage and perseverance of mankind</i>

1:58:42.380 --> 1:58:44.463
<i>will be etched among the stars.</i>

1:58:45.130 --> 1:58:47.380
<i>This long voyage of hope and despair</i>

1:58:47.588 --> 1:58:50.338
<i>will endure 2,500 years
through the cosmos.</i>
