WEBVTT

00:04.439 --> 00:06.571
- Previously on "Good Girls."

00:08.660 --> 00:09.966
Jesus.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.315
- Yeah.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.013
Guess we're back in business.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.884
- I made some stupid joke
about most movers

00:14.927 --> 00:16.146
coming straight out of prison,

00:16.190 --> 00:18.105
and the lead guy with
the tattoo thingie,

00:18.148 --> 00:20.237
his rap sheet reads like
a CVS receipt.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.673
- Lemonade?
He's gonna wash in ways

00:21.717 --> 00:23.153
that we can't.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.329
I'll text you the drop point.
- 50-50, right?

00:25.373 --> 00:27.375
- We said 10.
- I meant 50.

00:27.418 --> 00:31.944
- Dr. Cohen mentioned that you
could possibly play a role

00:31.988 --> 00:33.511
in our healing.

00:33.555 --> 00:36.079
- Remember last winter
when we saw that Celica

00:36.123 --> 00:38.168
slam into the pickup truck
on I-94?

00:38.212 --> 00:40.083
- Uh-huh.
- Is that my life?

00:40.127 --> 00:41.389
So how is this supposed
to work, anyway?

00:41.432 --> 00:43.260
- Just talk about
what's bothering you.

00:43.304 --> 00:44.957
- What if it was something
you wouldn't like

00:45.001 --> 00:46.046
but we wouldn't have
to sit next

00:46.089 --> 00:47.177
to the bathroom ever again?

00:47.221 --> 00:48.526
- His daddy's gonna be proud,
too.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.137
- I thought you said
he was gone.

00:53.009 --> 00:53.966
- Yeah, and then
he'll pop back up

00:54.010 --> 00:55.055
like he always does.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.230
- Hey, Mama.
- Daddy!

00:56.273 --> 00:58.058
- What's up, bub?
How you doing?

00:58.101 --> 01:00.538
She ain't comin'.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.201
Yeah, we both know
how this ends.

01:20.732 --> 01:22.952
So what's up?

01:22.995 --> 01:24.954
How you been?
Kids good?

01:27.478 --> 01:29.089
You know,
my boy says Jane's

01:29.132 --> 01:32.570
like the superstar forward
on the team.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.572
You think they'll make
the finals this year or what?

01:37.227 --> 01:39.490
Oh.

01:39.534 --> 01:40.970
I gotta show you something.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.546
Lung.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.116
Spleen.

02:00.642 --> 02:01.860
Shoulder.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.477
Thanks, man.
- Sure thing.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.787
To your aim.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.879
Well, suit yourself.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.798
Well, bottoms up.

02:26.842 --> 02:29.192
You got a lot to celebrate.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.760
Well, you made
a beautiful family.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.371
Helped out your community
and whatnot.

02:34.415 --> 02:36.939
Hell, I bet they name a wing
after you at your kids' school.

02:36.982 --> 02:40.508
Don't do...that.

02:41.813 --> 02:45.469
It just puts off
what's gonna come anyway.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.819
And then you gotta
wait for it,

02:47.863 --> 02:49.038
and trust me, that's...

02:50.344 --> 02:52.737
That's just way worse.

02:54.217 --> 02:57.002
Check it out.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.656
You're my girl,

02:58.700 --> 03:03.313
and so I'ma take it
easy on you.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.750
I'll do it myself.

03:08.362 --> 03:11.234
Let's get this over with.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.717
What do you say?

03:18.894 --> 03:21.201
- I'm pregnant.

03:31.776 --> 03:32.995
How was that?

03:34.039 --> 03:36.694
- Again.
- Again?

03:36.738 --> 03:37.913
- Again.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.264
- Okay.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.279
You awake?

04:00.327 --> 04:02.851
Oh, I need that.
- There you go.

04:02.894 --> 04:05.070
Can I...sit?

04:05.114 --> 04:07.203
- Yeah, sure.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.379
Is it sweet enough for you?
- Huh?

04:09.423 --> 04:11.860
- I put in that low-cal
hazelnut stuff.

04:12.948 --> 04:16.386
- Um, can you take Danny
to his ortho appointment today?

04:16.430 --> 04:18.388
- I'm sorry, I gotta--

04:18.432 --> 04:20.869
What has been going on here?

04:22.958 --> 04:25.526
- Sex?

04:25.569 --> 04:27.049
We've done it more
in the last few weeks

04:27.092 --> 04:30.270
than we did in high school.
- It's good.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.010
- It's like a circus.

04:32.054 --> 04:35.405
Like an awesome Russian
traveling kind of circus.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.234
- Like the kind with a bear
that rides the bike?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.280
- No, believe me,
I am not complaining.

04:40.323 --> 04:41.585
I'm just trying
to wrap my head around--

04:41.629 --> 04:44.806
- I guess I just...

04:46.590 --> 04:49.506
Feel like we're in
a better place.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.596
- Well, any time you
wanna visit more places,

04:52.640 --> 04:53.684
I'm...

04:54.642 --> 04:57.645
Totally, like, TripAdvisor.

04:58.385 --> 05:01.518
Can I shower now?

05:08.177 --> 05:09.396
- Beth.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.319
I love you.

05:24.411 --> 05:27.327
I'll wake up the kids.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.733
- What nights are you
working this week?

05:42.777 --> 05:45.823
- Uh, all of them,
if they give me the shifts.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.825
- 'Cause I'm gonna have to meet
the girls for you-know-what.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.305
- Egg roll.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.655
- But I didn't even say--
- Egg roll.

05:51.699 --> 05:52.917
- I said you-know-what
instead of--

05:52.961 --> 05:54.745
- Egg and roll.

05:58.401 --> 05:59.968
- A safe word
can't be two words.

06:00.011 --> 06:04.320
- Babe, only way this works
is if I know nothing.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.670
- So it's just egg roll, then?

06:06.714 --> 06:08.150
- If you don't wanna hear
about my job,

06:08.193 --> 06:09.978
then I cannot hear about yours.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.545
- Just to be clear...
- Mm-hmm?

06:11.588 --> 06:13.024
- I was about to say--
- Egg roll.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.983
Animals!
Slop's on!

06:16.463 --> 06:18.421
- No, that's a normal
wedgie.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.336
- Okay, I'm--I'm
a bit scared to ask.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.207
- It's your job to ask, Josh.

06:22.251 --> 06:24.558
- Uh, Dr. Cohen.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.475
Fine, what's an atomic wedgie?

06:28.518 --> 06:31.434
- Both sides front
and back same time,

06:31.478 --> 06:33.393
equal pressure.
- Oh, my God.

06:33.436 --> 06:36.744
- Yeah, way worse for a girl.
- I'll take your word for it.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.659
- You know how they cut those
big blocks of cheese

06:38.702 --> 06:40.574
with that wire?
- Okay.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.053
- And I would, like,
get up on a coffee table

06:42.097 --> 06:44.316
or the stairs
for max yank leverage.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.840
- Mm-hmm, nice.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.758
So Beth controlled the remote?

06:50.801 --> 06:52.760
- Literally every
Saturday morning,

06:52.803 --> 06:55.545
all I wanted was nine bowls
of cereal and "Muppet Babies."

06:55.589 --> 06:58.069
- Uh-huh,
and what about now?

06:58.113 --> 06:59.114
- What do you mean?

06:59.157 --> 07:00.158
- How do you handle it now

07:00.202 --> 07:02.639
when she takes the remote?

07:02.683 --> 07:04.467
- I have my own TV.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.513
- It's a metaphor, Annie.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.124
When she tries
to be the boss of you,

07:09.167 --> 07:10.212
what do you do?

07:13.215 --> 07:14.564
- Same, same.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.958
- You give you adult sister
an atomic wedgie?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.482
- It's a metaphor, Josh.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.006
- Okay, hear me out.

07:22.050 --> 07:25.009
What if your behavior is just
reinforcing her behavior?

07:25.053 --> 07:26.489
- What, you mean
like it's my fault

07:26.533 --> 07:27.751
that she's a total
control freak?

07:27.795 --> 07:30.145
- Well, instead of acting
like a child,

07:30.188 --> 07:32.626
maybe try to consider
where she's coming from.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.807
- You learned all that online?

07:42.026 --> 07:43.201
- And we're finished.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.029
- For good?

07:45.073 --> 07:46.814
- Today.
- Hmm.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.209
- Oh, send Sally in,
will you?

07:51.253 --> 07:54.691
She's the brace face
with the attitude problem.

07:54.735 --> 07:57.520
Don't tell her I said that.

- Does that look like
a mild sauce to you?

10:07.650 --> 10:08.651
Does it?
- Uh-oh.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.653
- Mmm, wait.
It gets worse.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.524
- Sir, they're all red.
I can't really--

10:12.568 --> 10:15.092
- Why don't you taste it,
then, and you tell me?

10:15.136 --> 10:17.442
- Our boy just got starched
at the Bell.

10:17.486 --> 10:19.923
- Hard.
Wait for it.

10:21.751 --> 10:22.970
- Oh, no!

10:24.014 --> 10:26.234
Where'd you get this?
- Drunk Detroit.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.236
It's hilarious when
you don't know the person.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.760
- So did he want mild
or not want mild?

10:30.804 --> 10:33.154
- It's unclear,
but then the cops tase him

10:33.197 --> 10:35.112
and he pulls out the Taser
cords like some kind of beast.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.679
- You serious?
- Yeah,

10:36.723 --> 10:37.854
and then they choke him out
and arrest him.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.290
- For a damn chalupa?
- Mm-hmm.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.292
Guess that's why
he never made the drop.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.164
- Who are you guys
talking about?

10:45.079 --> 10:47.995
- This dumbass has our money.
- Again.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.089
- I gotta pee.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.798
- Mom, Danny
won't let me play with him.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.147
- You're too little.
- No, I'm not.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.714
- Yes, you are.
You're no fun!

11:11.758 --> 11:13.107
- You're supposed to
let me play.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.456
- I don't wanna play

11:33.867 --> 11:37.609

just doing research.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.568
- Brand specs
are in the binders.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.135
- No, here--come here.
Hop in, hop in.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.919
Come on, I'll show you.
Come on.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.094
Here.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.661
Hand.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.618
All right.

11:46.662 --> 11:50.100
This is a first.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.059
- Okay, ready?
Close your eyes.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.235
- We have a staff meeting.
- I know, I know, I know.

11:54.278 --> 11:56.585
Trust me.
Close your eyes.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.673
Okay.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.458
What do you see?

12:01.895 --> 12:04.854
- People staring.
- No, on the inside.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.769
Imagine water.

12:06.813 --> 12:10.425
What--what does that--
what does that make you feel?

12:11.948 --> 12:14.777
- Silly.
- Okay.

12:16.126 --> 12:19.216
You're in your backyard.

12:19.260 --> 12:22.002
And it's night.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.395
And there's...

12:24.439 --> 12:27.616
a gentle breeze,
there's fireflies,

12:27.659 --> 12:32.012
and you got
your favorite drink.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.231
- Negroni.
- Perfect.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.451
Now what do you feel?

12:36.494 --> 12:39.149
- Mm, possibility.

12:39.193 --> 12:42.152
- Ooh, that's good.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.154
Possibility's good.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.766
People don't care how
things work for the most part,

12:46.809 --> 12:52.075
so I just try to sell feelings.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.383
- That's really smart.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.994
- It's a old trick
from the dealership days.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.173
- Will you have dinner
with me?

13:03.217 --> 13:05.088
- What?

13:05.132 --> 13:09.789
- You, me, wine, food,
wherever you wanna go.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.966
- To talk strategy
or some bus-dev or--

13:13.009 --> 13:16.360
- Whatever you need
to tell your wife.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.843
Let me know.
I'm open.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.370
- Well no wonder
people escape.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.719
Look at this.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.112
Right through
the metal detector.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.244
- Hey!
- Huh?

13:30.287 --> 13:31.680
But they take my
Flamin' Cheetos?

13:31.723 --> 13:33.638
- Why do you even have that?

13:33.682 --> 13:36.859
- What if I have to bust out
of a trunk?

13:36.903 --> 13:38.818
- Meanwhile I get
cavity searched.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.515
- Which, by the way,
methinks she was

13:40.558 --> 13:43.126
a little too into it.
- She was a lot into it.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.000
- I'm gonna do all the talking,
okay?

13:47.043 --> 13:48.349
- Why?

13:48.392 --> 13:50.873
- Because I hired him.
- She hired him.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.832
- Speaking of which,
what is the, uh,

13:52.875 --> 13:55.182
hierarchy of our new
business venture?

13:55.225 --> 13:56.270
- What are you talking about?

13:56.313 --> 13:58.054
- Titles.
- What?

13:59.403 --> 14:01.101
- Do we have
a marketing strategist?

14:01.144 --> 14:05.192
Who's head of HR?
Who's, say, president?

14:05.235 --> 14:07.847
- I don't know.
We all share.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.065
- Do we?

14:09.109 --> 14:10.632
- Aren't we all equal?

14:10.675 --> 14:12.634
- Are we?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.125
- Thank you so much.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.215
So good to see you.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.781
Please, have a seat.

14:35.396 --> 14:36.876
- They said my lawyers
were here.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.573
- Well, we couldn't say
we're friends.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.227
- That hurts.

14:40.270 --> 14:43.143
- So, where's our, uh, product?

14:43.186 --> 14:45.101
- Depends.
- On what?

14:45.145 --> 14:46.929
- How quick you can
get me out of here.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.235
- Okay, hold on.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.932
- Yeah, we didn't throw down
over a gordita.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.413
- That's on you.
- Chalupa.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.981
- Okay, well the cops
can find it,

14:55.024 --> 14:56.983
and then I'll just tell them
it's yours.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.637
- Sit--sit down.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.599
Where is it?

15:07.994 --> 15:10.953
- In my van.
- Where is your van?

15:10.997 --> 15:13.825
- Wherever vans go
when you get bagged.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.962
- Do not look at me!

15:20.876 --> 15:22.965
Nuh-uh.
This is not coming my way.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.489
Not this time.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.493
Fine, you can keep looking.
It's not gonna happen.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.067
Ran into Sunny today.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.460
- Mike's wife?

15:39.503 --> 15:41.201
- Yeah, she came in
for acrylics.

15:41.244 --> 15:42.854
- Mm.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.989
What's the occasion?
- You, boo.

15:48.599 --> 15:49.949
- Cheers.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.692
- Yeah, she says, uh,
Mike misses you at the station.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.696
- She did?

15:58.740 --> 16:00.742
- He thinks about you a lot.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.007
- She said that?

16:05.051 --> 16:08.010
- Yeah, maybe you should, uh,
give him a call.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.925
You know, catch up.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.145
- Please,
I see him at softball.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.625
He barely says a word to me.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.674
- All right.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.982
I need a van from the impound.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.728
What's in the van?

16:32.121 --> 16:33.993
What's in the van, Ruby?

16:35.429 --> 16:36.647
- Egg roll?

16:37.126 --> 16:38.910
- You didn't even run
into Sunny, did you?

16:38.954 --> 16:41.174
- Egg roll.

16:47.354 --> 16:48.572
- ♪ Bizarre

17:14.946 --> 17:17.210
♪ She's so bizarre

17:34.662 --> 17:36.490
♪ Bizarre, bizarre

17:44.019 --> 17:45.803
♪ Bizarre, bizarre

17:53.637 --> 17:55.335
♪ Bizarre, bizarre

18:13.092 --> 18:15.268
♪ Bizarre, bizarre

18:22.188 --> 18:24.581
♪ Bizarre, bizarre

18:32.546 --> 18:34.417
♪ Bizarre, bizarre

18:58.049 --> 18:59.747
- What's this?
- Oh, Jesus!

18:59.790 --> 19:02.271
- Are you trying
to get pregnant?

19:06.884 --> 19:08.625
- It's not the worst thing.

19:11.541 --> 19:14.196
It's a discussion,
at least.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.940
- Well, let's have it.

19:18.983 --> 19:21.464
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.078
- We have a billion kids,
Beth.

19:27.122 --> 19:30.212
- We have four.
- It's completely insane.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.779
- Why?
Because I want it?

19:31.822 --> 19:35.043
- Because we can't afford
the ones we have.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.219
- Well, it looks like you
already made up your mind.

19:37.263 --> 19:40.048
- And what about you using me
in some sort of midlife crisis?

19:40.091 --> 19:42.790
- Wow, really nice.
- Or whatever the hell this is.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.183
- At least I'm having sex
with you

19:44.226 --> 19:45.880
and not someone at work.
- Oh, here we go.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.664
- Or maybe I should
just learn from the best.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.057
- That's what it is,
isn't it?

19:49.100 --> 19:50.798
- What are you talking about?

19:50.841 --> 19:53.017
- The crazy, the toys,

19:53.061 --> 19:54.889
the acrobatics, the outfits.

19:54.932 --> 19:57.239
- That's sex, Dean.

20:00.677 --> 20:04.203
- Am I just...a sperm bank?

20:14.648 --> 20:16.606
- Did you dye your hair?

20:21.568 --> 20:24.484
You know wh--what really sucks?

20:26.616 --> 20:29.619
For like a second there...

20:29.663 --> 20:32.361
we felt like us again.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.242
- I'm sorry.
I sh--

20:47.246 --> 20:49.335
- I don't want another kid.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.476
- Okay, there you go.
- Okay.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.806
- You like oranges?
Okay.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.808
Why don't you take two?

21:39.341 --> 21:41.561
- I don't know what you know.

21:45.260 --> 21:49.351
But I know you know enough
to hate my guts, so...

21:49.395 --> 21:52.136
- Hey, way to hustle, Hanna.

21:53.007 --> 21:54.704
- I know it sounds stupid,

21:54.748 --> 21:56.706
but I was just trying
to make it right.

21:56.750 --> 22:01.189
- Does it come without seeds?
- Um, try this one.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.887
- Or at least make it better
for you guys.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.889
I thought that--
- Seed!

22:05.933 --> 22:07.151
- Eat it, Hayden.

22:09.502 --> 22:14.376
It was selfish
and creepy and messed up,

22:14.420 --> 22:16.465
and I would take it all back
if I could and--

22:16.509 --> 22:18.598
- Janet, can you bring me
some more wipes?

22:18.641 --> 22:20.643
- Sure.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.386
- I need your help.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.304
I'm not pregnant.

22:30.784 --> 22:33.264
- Can we have a play date?
- Please?

22:33.308 --> 22:35.571
- No.
- No, you have piano.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.537
He will kill me
when he finds out.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.558
Thanks for the loan.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.787
- Do we have
to invite Uncle Jack?

23:17.831 --> 23:19.615
He just gets so wasted.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.704
Fine, but then he can't sit
by any of the nieces.

23:21.748 --> 23:24.011
No, that's not me, Mom.
That's the court.

23:26.361 --> 23:29.320
No, I gotta dip.
They need me in surgery.

23:29.364 --> 23:31.975
Yeah, subdural hematoma.

23:32.019 --> 23:34.804
I gotta scrub in stat
for the craniotomy.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.676
Love you.
Bye.

23:39.374 --> 23:41.463
- So, how's your mom?

23:41.507 --> 23:42.943
- Crazier than ever.

23:50.298 --> 23:51.647
- So what's the deal?

23:51.691 --> 23:53.127
She thinks you're some kind
of brain doctor?

23:55.129 --> 23:56.652
- Surgical assistant.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.438
- Must be hard keeping that up.
- What do you mean?

24:00.656 --> 24:02.528
- Living with all those lies.

24:02.571 --> 24:03.790
- She wouldn't take my money

24:03.833 --> 24:05.182
if she knew where
it really came from.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.272
This way,
I can take care of her.

24:08.316 --> 24:09.709
- Oh.
- Hmm?

24:09.752 --> 24:12.189
- All right.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.582
- I'm like her hero.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.672
Yeah.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.326
Give you something to celebrate
in the champagne room.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.762
Right?

24:19.806 --> 24:23.679
Half my time in there goes
to her blackjack problem.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.072
Crazy.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.223
Hey, Mi--

24:46.267 --> 24:48.269
Yeah, yeah.
What's up, buddy?

24:49.444 --> 24:53.535
Mm-hmm.
No, no, I just, um,

24:53.579 --> 24:56.712
uh, really been thinking
about you, man.

24:56.756 --> 24:59.759
Well, kinda need a favor,
actually.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.416
- How much was bail?
- A lot.

25:05.460 --> 25:06.983
- What's a lot?

25:07.027 --> 25:08.419
- Everything we made.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.639
- For throwing down
over some hot sauce?

25:10.683 --> 25:12.032
- It's not his first rodeo.

25:12.075 --> 25:14.600
Apparently the judge called him
a flight risk.

25:16.906 --> 25:20.519
- This idiot's so not worth it.
- He's all we have.

25:20.562 --> 25:24.305
- Yo, where's my rig?
- You don't see it?

25:25.306 --> 25:26.612
-  Yeah...

25:26.655 --> 25:28.614
- We weren't embarrassed
at all driving it.

25:28.657 --> 25:29.745
- So we back in business?

25:29.789 --> 25:31.530
- Soon as we fire up
the presses.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.357
- We're gonna need
a little break.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.577
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

25:35.621 --> 25:37.361
- It's really not a good time.

25:37.405 --> 25:41.017
- Uh, we just spent everything
we had on that little bail out.

25:41.061 --> 25:43.498
- Well, I'm getting a lot
of heat at work, okay?

25:43.542 --> 25:46.414
- From who?
- From the owner.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.372
- Dorothy?
- Can I go now?

25:48.416 --> 25:49.373
- We'll call you.

25:49.417 --> 25:50.461
- You're worried about

25:50.505 --> 25:53.464
an 80-year-old with cataracts.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.597
- I mean,
if she's asking questions...

25:55.641 --> 25:57.773
- She asked me what grade
I was in,

25:57.817 --> 25:59.993
but sure.
Bitch's bringing the heat.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.081
- Keys?

26:01.821 --> 26:03.605
- Oh, sorry.

26:06.042 --> 26:07.609
- We'll get up and running,
okay?

26:07.653 --> 26:10.177
- Yeah, today.
Hey.

26:10.220 --> 26:11.352
Don't go anywhere.

26:11.395 --> 26:14.311
- You can go.
- Do not go.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.487
You just can't help yourself.

26:16.531 --> 26:17.576
- What's your problem?

26:17.619 --> 26:18.794
- What it always is.

26:18.838 --> 26:21.884
- I am dealing with
so much right now.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.582
I just need you to--
- You're dealing.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.322
You need.
- Oh, my God.

26:25.366 --> 26:26.976
- Because you're the president.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.325
- I am not the president!

26:28.369 --> 26:29.631
- Oh, I'm sorry.

26:29.675 --> 26:32.373
CEO, Admiral,
Captain my Captain.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.679
Whatever you want me
to call it.

26:33.722 --> 26:34.941
- I'm dead.

26:36.203 --> 26:37.813
- That's not a title.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.949
- He's alive.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.040
- What?

26:48.737 --> 26:50.696
- How?

26:53.046 --> 26:55.526
- He just is.

26:59.356 --> 27:00.880
- I'm just saying...
- Don't.

27:00.923 --> 27:02.185
- Even if you gave

27:02.229 --> 27:04.274
a sharpshooter three bullets...
- Do not.

27:04.318 --> 27:09.628
- With specific instructions
not to hit any vital organs,

27:09.671 --> 27:11.804
it would be
physically impossible.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.370
- How are you helping?

27:13.414 --> 27:16.373
- This is how I process.
- Can I have another?

27:18.854 --> 27:21.857
- So you have
a nine month solution

27:21.901 --> 27:23.990
to a permanent problem.

27:25.861 --> 27:28.995
- Three months.
Maybe four.

27:29.735 --> 27:30.910
- What are you gonna do?

27:30.953 --> 27:32.172
- I'm gonna drink this

27:32.215 --> 27:34.478
and then I'm gonna
have another.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.700
- Sorry I called you
a president.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.224
You didn't know.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.009
- You should have told us.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.577
- I was afraid
he'd come after you guys.

27:46.621 --> 27:49.406
- Beth, let's go to the cops.

27:49.450 --> 27:50.756
- Then we're all in jail

27:50.799 --> 27:52.888
and I still get shivved
in the yard.

27:53.802 --> 27:56.283
- Well...

27:57.632 --> 27:59.721
It's actually much more common
to get shanked.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.375
- What's the difference?

28:01.418 --> 28:04.421
- A shank's got a sharp edge,
you know?

28:04.465 --> 28:07.294
Like a scrap of metal
from the license plate shop

28:07.337 --> 28:09.426
or the top of a can
of baked beans,

28:09.470 --> 28:12.038
whereas a shiv is more like
when you melt down

28:12.081 --> 28:14.605
a toothbrush or a bunch
of Jolly Rangers

28:14.649 --> 28:15.650
to a fine point.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.304
You know, it takes fire.

28:17.347 --> 28:21.525
It's just--it's
a lot more work.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.794
- Can we Postmates
some French fries?

28:31.274 --> 28:33.624
- We can do anything you want.

28:42.329 --> 28:44.592
- The thing is nobody should
have nine bowls

28:44.635 --> 28:46.028
of Oops! All Berries.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.334
I mean, really,
you shouldn't even have one.

28:47.377 --> 28:48.988
And--and I would have watched

28:49.031 --> 28:50.511
TV until my face melted off
if she had let me,

28:50.554 --> 28:54.254
so I have no business
holding that remote.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.473
- This is not your session.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.999
- Oh.
Hi.

29:00.042 --> 29:02.392
- Can I go to the bathroom?

29:03.089 --> 29:04.786
Yeah.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.702
Yeah, sure.
It's just down the hall,

29:07.746 --> 29:09.225
to the left.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.882
- Sorry.

29:19.409 --> 29:22.717
- Fiona walked in on her
parents making love last night.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.762
- Eww.
- Right?

29:23.805 --> 29:25.024
- No, you.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.895
Who says "making love"?

29:28.331 --> 29:32.205
- Question,
what is Oops! All Berries?

29:32.248 --> 29:35.121
- Well, it's not berries,
and it's definitely on purpose.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.036
I would thank Cap'n Crunch,
but he's the genius

29:37.079 --> 29:39.212
who discontinued
his own masterpiece.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.867
- So your sister was trying
to protect you?

29:41.910 --> 29:43.825
- She still is.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.131
- Is that so bad?

29:47.655 --> 29:50.266
- Who's gonna protect her?

29:53.269 --> 29:54.314
- Hmm.

29:56.011 --> 29:58.057
You know what they call this
in the biz?

29:59.754 --> 30:01.930
A breakthrough.

30:02.931 --> 30:03.889
- Eww.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.238
- How is that gross?

30:05.281 --> 30:07.414
- It's how you said it.

30:08.632 --> 30:10.112
- It's a good thing.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.461
- What am I supposed
to do with it?

30:11.505 --> 30:13.594
- Well, now you know
where she's coming from.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.683
Changes the whole dynamic.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.254
- So am I, like, cured?

30:21.297 --> 30:24.866
- Mm, not till that deadbeat ex
of yours pays me.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.608
Oh.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.520
- Hey now.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.055
- How you feeling, Mama?

31:25.971 --> 31:27.407
- Nauseous.

31:27.450 --> 31:30.845
- Let's go for a drive.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.542
Get some air.

31:34.066 --> 31:36.633
- I should get these inside.

31:36.677 --> 31:38.331
There's ice cream.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.508
- Get in the car, Elizabeth.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.067
- Hey.
You got a sec?

32:19.111 --> 32:22.636
- I was just on with corporate
telling them about my new star.

32:22.679 --> 32:24.464
- Great.
Um...

32:26.466 --> 32:28.598
- Are you o--you okay?

32:29.686 --> 32:32.559
You can't quit.
- Yeah, it's just, uh...

32:33.647 --> 32:34.822
Dinner.

32:34.865 --> 32:38.043
- What'd you decide?
- I really want to.

32:38.086 --> 32:40.741
- Great.
- But I can't.

32:42.134 --> 32:44.745
I mean, I--I could.
- Which is it, Dean?

32:44.788 --> 32:49.619
- Well, back at the dealership,
I had lots of dinners.

32:50.142 --> 32:53.362
Couple times a week, even.
All different kinds of cuisine.

32:53.406 --> 32:54.929
'Cause I was a foodie.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.367
I mean, there was no dinner
that I didn't like,

32:58.411 --> 33:01.718
and now I'm really,
really trying

33:01.762 --> 33:04.199
to eat more at home.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.071
I just think it's healthier,
you know?

33:06.114 --> 33:08.943
For my marriage.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.032
- I get it.
- You do?

33:11.076 --> 33:12.512
- Totally.

33:12.555 --> 33:16.081
- I mean, it's not
that I'm not hungry.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.300
- We're good.

33:18.344 --> 33:19.606
- I love working here.

33:19.649 --> 33:22.826
- We really love having you,
Dean.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.611
- Well...

33:24.654 --> 33:26.787
Thank you for understanding.

33:31.357 --> 33:34.186
Oh, uh, that contractor
you connected me with,

33:34.229 --> 33:36.101
I got him on the hook
for eight aqua jets

33:36.144 --> 33:37.276
for his condo development.

33:37.319 --> 33:38.712
- You know what?

33:38.755 --> 33:41.280
Why don't you have Tony
close that one?

33:41.323 --> 33:42.759
- But I've already done
the heavy lifting.

33:42.803 --> 33:45.849
- I'm gonna need you
in barbecue accessories.

33:47.373 --> 33:50.550
- Putting me on tongs?
- Is that a problem?

33:53.640 --> 33:55.598
- No.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.296
I'll just go fill Tony in.

34:11.179 --> 34:12.137
- Your first?

34:15.140 --> 34:18.056
- No, no.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.319
- When are you due?

34:20.362 --> 34:22.451
- You know,
that's a good question.

34:22.495 --> 34:23.713
Honey?

34:26.412 --> 34:28.327
I guess that's why we're here,
then, huh?

34:29.937 --> 34:33.114
- How crazy to think there's
a tiny human in there.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.029
- Yeah, yeah.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.640
Yeah, it almost doesn't
feel real.

34:41.992 --> 34:43.168
- I'm gonna use the bathroom.

34:43.211 --> 34:46.127
- No, chill, chill, chill,
chill, chill.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.520
They're gonna need it.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.143
- When was the positive test?

35:02.187 --> 35:04.189
- A couple of weeks ago.

35:04.232 --> 35:08.410
- Date of your last period?

35:08.454 --> 35:09.933
- I d--I don't know.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.892
- Any idea when you conceived?

35:14.155 --> 35:16.026
- Come on, darling.
You remember?

35:16.070 --> 35:18.725
- I hit it in the bedroom
when your husband was at work.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.248
- I put it on the form.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.598
- Oh, there it is.
Okay.

35:22.642 --> 35:24.905
Well, it's, uh, probably too
soon to see a heartbeat,

35:24.948 --> 35:26.907
so for today we'll just take
some blood to confirm.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.170
- How long does that take?
- About a day or two.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.476
- Thank you so much.

35:30.519 --> 35:31.694
- In the meantime,

35:31.738 --> 35:33.131
watch the alcohol,
no sushi,

35:33.174 --> 35:35.045
no deli meat just to be safe.
- Got it.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.351
- Okay, see you in
a few weeks.

35:36.395 --> 35:38.614
- Hey, Doc.
- Yes?

35:38.658 --> 35:40.181
- It couldn't hurt to try,
right?

35:40.225 --> 35:42.401
- Well, it depends
on how far along.

35:42.444 --> 35:43.967
- Let's fire it up.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.797
- I mean, what's the point if
we can't see anything, right?

35:47.841 --> 35:49.495
- Lay back.
- Come on.

35:49.538 --> 35:51.192
- Got a super excited daddy
here.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.454
- That's right.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.544
- Okay.

35:57.242 --> 35:58.634
Just relax.

36:00.462 --> 36:04.205
You all right?
How's Marcus doing?

36:04.249 --> 36:05.685
- Oh, bad as ever.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.208
Yeah, he keeps me on my toes,
though.

36:11.430 --> 36:14.172
- Huh.
- What's that?

36:17.218 --> 36:18.959
- Congratulations.

36:22.354 --> 36:25.183
Strong implantation.
Healthy sac.

36:25.226 --> 36:27.750
Lining's nice and thick.
- I don't see anything.

36:27.794 --> 36:28.969
- Well, you go to eight years
of med school,

36:29.012 --> 36:32.494
then take a look.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.496
Anything else?

36:34.540 --> 36:36.542
- Paternity test.

36:36.585 --> 36:38.457
- Oh, you can do that
in about a month.

36:43.810 --> 36:45.942
- Thank you so much.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.249
- Thank your friend.

37:11.272 --> 37:12.882
- Everything okay?

37:19.933 --> 37:21.848
- Big day.
- Yeah?

37:21.891 --> 37:24.111
What happened?
- With what?

37:24.154 --> 37:26.069
- You know, egg roll.
- Oh.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.810
Can we switch to calamari
or something?

37:27.854 --> 37:30.073
I'm sick of thinking about--
- There you go.

37:30.117 --> 37:33.294
No more safe words.
- Yay.

37:33.338 --> 37:37.516
- So apparently your son

37:37.559 --> 37:39.344
dropped the F-bomb
at school today.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.346
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

37:41.389 --> 37:43.565
And Ms. Rodner also said
that he was going around

37:43.609 --> 37:45.306
the playground
asking other kids

37:45.350 --> 37:48.309
if they would like
to see his coccyx.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.617
- You know, that mickey fickey
told me my epidermis

37:51.660 --> 37:53.314
was showing last week.

37:53.358 --> 37:54.576
He said that?

37:54.620 --> 37:55.969
- Yeah, I spent an hour
in the mirror

37:56.012 --> 37:57.753
checking for my underwear.

37:57.797 --> 37:59.929
- Boy, I tell you,
even if it ain't dirty,

37:59.973 --> 38:01.322
that boy'll make it dirty.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.932
- Hey, will you stop?

38:02.976 --> 38:06.284
- Rodner also said that
we should make a swear jar.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.111
You know, have him put, like,
a quarter or something in there

38:08.155 --> 38:12.855
and do something good
with the money.

38:12.899 --> 38:15.075
- Oh, we can open a church
with that potty mouth.

38:15.945 --> 38:17.207
How much you got on you?

38:17.991 --> 38:19.993
- Like, 40 bucks.
- Okay.

38:21.473 --> 38:22.691
Put half in there.

38:23.388 --> 38:26.173
- I didn't say coccyx.
- For the van.

38:30.482 --> 38:31.526
- Right now?
- Yes,

38:31.570 --> 38:32.832
or for any other time

38:32.875 --> 38:35.530
that you're gonna have
to say egg roll.

38:40.970 --> 38:44.147
- We're not bad people, Stan.

38:44.191 --> 38:48.195
- No, baby, we're good people
who do bad things.

38:53.026 --> 38:56.203
- How long have you been at it?
- Two hours.

38:56.246 --> 38:57.291
- Liar.

38:58.074 --> 38:59.119
- Three.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.731
Fine, four.

39:02.775 --> 39:03.819
Dude, you're done.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.647
- I have a social studies test.

39:05.691 --> 39:06.822
- You always do this.

39:06.866 --> 39:07.910
You study way too much

39:07.954 --> 39:08.955
and then you burn yourself out

39:08.998 --> 39:10.913
and you choke.
- Harsh.

39:10.957 --> 39:11.914
- Come on.
Take a break.

39:11.958 --> 39:12.915
Come on.
Let's go.

39:14.177 --> 39:14.917
- Okay.

39:14.961 --> 39:18.181
- What's mexyldreselthate?

39:18.225 --> 39:20.227
- Brain food.

39:20.270 --> 39:22.055
Okay, here you go.

39:22.751 --> 39:24.405
Eh?
Take a bite.

39:29.279 --> 39:30.672
- Mmm.

39:30.716 --> 39:33.371
- It's stale.
- Mmm.

39:33.414 --> 39:34.502
Needs some more milk.

39:34.546 --> 39:35.677
It'll soften it up a little.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.856
Mm-hmm, so what you wanna do
is you just keep replenishing

39:40.900 --> 39:42.945
until the milk's gone, okay?

39:42.989 --> 39:45.034
And then the sugar rush
keeps you jacked up enough

39:45.078 --> 39:47.167
to get through the six-hour
cartoon marathon.

39:47.210 --> 39:49.387
- How did you
survive childhood?

39:52.433 --> 39:53.478
- Auntie Beth.

39:57.264 --> 39:58.308
Mmm.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.791
- My tongue tastes...

40:03.618 --> 40:05.533
Blue?

40:05.577 --> 40:07.927
Just go with it.

40:09.363 --> 40:11.191
I really have to study.

40:12.105 --> 40:13.846
- Someday you'll thank me.

40:17.632 --> 40:21.288

40:21.331 --> 40:25.945
- Okay, one, two, three.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.165

40:37.522 --> 40:38.958

40:41.047 --> 40:42.570
- Oh, come on, baby.
Let's go.

40:42.614 --> 40:44.572
Come on.

40:44.616 --> 40:46.139

40:48.663 --> 40:50.143

40:51.753 --> 40:53.320
- I just wanna know why.
