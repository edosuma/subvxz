WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:03.180
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:03.180 --> 00:04.550
I believe that these stones were

00:04.650 --> 00:06.390
transported I've never seen anything

00:06.390 --> 00:08.679
like this maybe we're done with the

00:08.679 --> 00:10.880
money pit there has to be enough seed ah

00:10.880 --> 00:15.070
no I refuse to use the word failure

00:15.070 --> 00:19.109
he's over there this might be part of

00:19.109 --> 00:22.650
the original dig this one deathbed from

00:22.650 --> 00:24.599
sixteen fifty five to sixty ninety five

00:24.599 --> 00:27.660
right there original money pit yes

00:31.460 --> 00:34.890
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:34.890 --> 00:36.541
where people have been looking for an

00:36.541 --> 00:39.980
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:39.980 --> 00:43.370
years so far they have found bits of

00:43.370 --> 00:46.940
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:46.940 --> 00:50.620
symbols carved into it even a 17th

00:50.620 --> 00:52.780
century Spanish coin

00:52.780 --> 00:55.750
today six men have died trying to solve

00:55.750 --> 00:56.960
the mystery

00:56.960 --> 01:01.230
and according to legend one more will

01:01.230 --> 01:05.730
have to die before the treasure 
can be found

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:25.579 --> 01:27.509
those are some massive beams you know

01:28.009 --> 01:29.249
but what's it doing down there right

01:29.249 --> 01:33.959
around 100 102 I don't know in a year

01:33.959 --> 01:36.119
that has already been filled with new

01:36.119 --> 01:37.119
discoveries

01:37.119 --> 01:41.749
it's probably 18 feet long I'm thinking

01:41.749 --> 01:43.689
ship planking and frustrating

01:43.689 --> 01:48.579
disappointments whoa no we got a big

01:48.579 --> 01:52.219
leak brothers Rick and Marty lagina are

01:52.219 --> 01:54.369
hoping that their third big dig at the

01:54.369 --> 01:56.770
money pit site will lead to their

01:56.770 --> 01:59.649
biggest breakthrough yet well here's the

01:59.649 --> 02:01.200
curious thing this is what Craig

02:01.200 --> 02:03.609
actually was really intrigued by this

02:03.609 --> 02:06.549
one piece of wood it's a peg no it's not

02:06.549 --> 02:09.830
a pig they cut it off for c14 testing

02:09.830 --> 02:11.230
Craig thought we might be in the money

02:11.230 --> 02:13.220
pit with these timbers and this lady's

02:13.220 --> 02:14.360
part of the original dig

02:14.360 --> 02:17.940
remember the money fit the description

02:17.940 --> 02:19.900
of the layers every 10 feet

02:19.900 --> 02:23.920
you're right they could be that if

02:23.920 --> 02:26.350
there'd been layers of these most like

02:26.350 --> 02:27.690
that yeah

02:27.690 --> 02:31.030
good make a nice platform

02:31.030 --> 02:33.760
that's pretty significant piece of wood

02:33.760 --> 02:36.970
when the money pit was first discovered

02:36.970 --> 02:41.180
back in 1795 treasure hunter Daniel

02:41.180 --> 02:44.050
McGinnis reported finding platforms made

02:44.050 --> 02:48.090
of rounded oak logs every 10 feet when

02:48.090 --> 02:50.220
some years later he and his fellow

02:50.220 --> 02:52.910
searchers eventually reached a ninth

02:52.910 --> 02:55.640
platform they found a large stone slab

02:55.640 --> 02:58.540
marked with strange hieroglyphs when the

02:58.540 --> 03:01.360
slab was removed it triggered what was

03:01.360 --> 03:03.590
believed to be a booby-trapped flood

03:03.590 --> 03:06.290
tunnel and the 90-foot deep shaft

03:06.290 --> 03:07.540
quickly filled with seawater

03:07.540 --> 03:12.370
but does the discovery of this rounded

03:12.370 --> 03:14.840
piece of would mean that the laginas and

03:14.840 --> 03:17.090
their partners have just located a

03:17.090 --> 03:18.890
portion of the original money pit

03:27.690 --> 03:29.250
let's see what the man over here Nestle

03:29.450 --> 03:31.690
there he is horn and gentlemen good

03:31.690 --> 03:32.690
morning

03:32.690 --> 03:35.610
oh yeah Andrew are you doing good how's

03:35.610 --> 03:37.100
it going it's going

03:37.100 --> 03:39.210
alright now we're down 118 feet with the

03:39.210 --> 03:41.560
can and 104 feet with the escalation our

03:41.560 --> 03:46.580
target depth is still from like 160 okay

03:46.580 --> 03:49.040
so we find wood I don't necessarily want

03:49.040 --> 03:51.750
to call it all stop but we want to take

03:51.750 --> 03:54.230
a good hard look at it okay actually a

03:54.230 --> 03:56.120
bunch of Roanoke log would be hugely

03:56.120 --> 03:59.060
significant to get Andrew you got work

03:59.060 --> 04:01.110
to do so let's do it

04:01.110 --> 04:03.420
we're burning fog good bring this off

04:03.420 --> 04:05.931
hopefully no like daylight it is it

04:05.931 --> 04:06.931
ain't de la that's a

04:06.931 --> 04:15.130
how long minute bring something home

04:15.130 --> 04:17.101
we stand there and watch that mr. pacman

04:17.101 --> 04:20.060
go in and out of that pipe every time if

04:20.060 --> 04:21.810
you want to see something really cool

04:21.810 --> 04:24.300
hanging out of those jaws a significant

04:24.300 --> 04:26.200
piece of wood a bit of a treasure chest

04:26.200 --> 04:29.600
a piece of brass something I guarantee

04:29.600 --> 04:31.930
every time every time everybody's 
hoping for

04:51.430 --> 04:52.810
piece of wood there

04:55.710 --> 04:57.660
there's some really dark wood at the

04:58.760 --> 04:59.760
Bark's alarm

05:10.660 --> 05:12.260
seems to be raining over yeah I guess

05:12.260 --> 05:13.730
what I'm gonna put a raincoat on

05:15.830 --> 05:17.280
although the massive cranes and

05:17.280 --> 05:20.000
equipment can work through rain if

05:20.000 --> 05:22.290
lightning should begin to appear the

05:22.290 --> 05:24.720
operation will need to be shut down for

05:24.720 --> 05:25.720
safety purposes

05:25.720 --> 05:31.150
just watch for lightning do you guys see

05:31.150 --> 05:32.150
any lightning

05:32.150 --> 05:34.230
new

05:34.230 --> 05:42.000
we'll see how things go here

05:50.200 --> 05:53.860
we are digging hole number three and we

05:53.860 --> 05:56.520
came across something unanticipated

05:56.520 --> 05:59.610
exciting actually

05:59.610 --> 06:01.240
and we come up with a very different

06:01.240 --> 06:03.370
looking piece of wood it's got a wedge

06:03.370 --> 06:07.199
shape to it clearly shaped by man I'm

06:07.199 --> 06:08.950
pretty sure it's hardwood based on its

06:08.950 --> 06:11.360
density and the hardness to its feel

06:11.360 --> 06:13.040
looks different than the Timbers we've

06:13.040 --> 06:16.669
been through this is the most intriguing

06:16.669 --> 06:21.280
piece I mean I think that might be old

06:21.280 --> 06:25.760
a lot denser like it's old it doesn't

06:25.760 --> 06:27.730
really look like it fits with all out

06:27.730 --> 06:30.490
over there I think Dan might want it

06:30.490 --> 06:38.360
look at this yeah I think you'd be

06:38.360 --> 06:41.510
interested

06:41.510 --> 06:45.169
as is often the case on Oak Island water

06:45.169 --> 06:48.010
either from the sky or from the ground

06:48.010 --> 06:49.980
becomes the obstacle to progress

06:49.980 --> 06:58.520
about the time that some very

06:58.520 --> 07:00.560
interesting wood is coming out of t one

07:00.560 --> 07:03.120
nature who always holds the trump card

07:03.120 --> 07:04.840
puts a stop to everything with a nice

07:04.840 --> 07:07.020
loud clap of thunder and a spark of

07:07.020 --> 07:11.650
lightning because that crew can't work

07:11.650 --> 07:14.120
under lightning conditions with all that

07:14.120 --> 07:16.030
steel way up in the air so we're shut

07:16.030 --> 07:18.560
down a perfect opportunity to go show

07:18.560 --> 07:30.590
our finds to Dan having worked and lived

07:30.590 --> 07:33.350
on Oak Island for more than five decades

07:33.350 --> 07:36.979
dan Blankenship has seen more and knows

07:36.979 --> 07:40.470
more about the 221 year old mystery than

07:40.470 --> 07:45.550
anyone alive we dug up some more stuff

07:45.550 --> 07:47.660
at the money pit we're in the third hole

07:47.660 --> 07:50.030
now some of these things came from about

07:50.030 --> 07:54.760
a hundred and 102 feet okay

07:54.760 --> 08:01.610
it's not soft wood then say Maya see how

08:01.610 --> 08:10.050
tightly Green is Joe and then 118 give

08:10.050 --> 08:15.540
or take this piece came up it's a wedge

08:15.540 --> 08:19.100
yes it was a wedge if what was a wedge

08:19.100 --> 08:22.389
for watching their tempers in the corner

08:22.389 --> 08:28.690
and who are they dan has a lot of

08:28.690 --> 08:31.300
experience with discovering things I

08:31.300 --> 08:34.200
don't got mad so you know what I am

08:34.200 --> 08:37.089
always hoping is he'll say oh yeah I saw

08:37.089 --> 08:39.149
that before over here and then that's a

08:39.149 --> 08:40.669
piece of data that we can use to

08:40.669 --> 08:43.390
correlate trollin excellent this was

08:43.390 --> 08:47.250
about this long I cut it in half to set

08:47.250 --> 08:48.830
it off for carbon testing

08:48.830 --> 08:59.320
I cut a piece off of here it's hard this

08:59.320 --> 09:06.390
one's hard wood go ahead for a little

09:06.390 --> 09:11.850
piece of wood well this has really fine

09:11.850 --> 09:14.510
green to Dan just like the other one see

09:14.510 --> 09:19.590
it I see if this is old let's say this

09:19.590 --> 09:22.750
is oak could this be the original round

09:22.750 --> 09:24.440
logs that they say we're in the money

09:24.440 --> 09:25.440
pit

09:25.440 --> 09:31.100
way back in 1795 it has an odor

09:31.100 --> 09:34.730
definitely had a significant odor to it

09:34.730 --> 09:37.900
the fact that the wood is both black in

09:37.900 --> 09:41.170
color and has a foul odor is a good

09:41.170 --> 09:44.100
indication that it is also centuries old

09:44.100 --> 09:49.320
we get this singular round smaller

09:49.320 --> 09:52.730
dimension piece of wood very blackened I

09:52.730 --> 09:54.750
think it was like a stockade you know

09:54.750 --> 09:58.300
like this flat and the original

09:58.300 --> 10:00.390
description of the money pit is every 10

10:00.390 --> 10:02.410
feet there were oak logs embedded in the

10:02.410 --> 10:03.410
walls

10:03.410 --> 10:06.080
could this be one of them appears to be

10:06.080 --> 10:08.300
oak it's very heavy

10:08.300 --> 10:12.070
very tight grain could this be one of

10:12.070 --> 10:14.270
those pieces I'm be interested to find

10:14.270 --> 10:16.800
out what's your cock and didn't chose I

10:16.800 --> 10:21.120
you know age wise if this comes back

10:21.120 --> 10:23.670
1550 or something then that's pretty

10:23.670 --> 10:26.450
significant that's a pretty good

10:26.450 --> 10:28.880
indication that you're in the right spot

10:28.880 --> 10:37.000
well guys we're going up here to I think

10:37.000 --> 10:38.940
probably Fred Nolan's most traumatic

10:38.940 --> 10:41.300
discovery while waiting for the

10:41.300 --> 10:44.290
operation at the money pit to resume

10:44.290 --> 10:46.870
Rick lagina along with Island historian

10:46.870 --> 10:50.080
Charles Barkhouse and Jack Begley have

10:50.080 --> 10:52.860
invited stonemasons Mike Whalen and Mark

10:52.860 --> 10:55.350
Fouchier to inspect one of the most

10:55.350 --> 10:58.170
intriguing rock formations ever found on

10:58.170 --> 11:02.480
Oak Island Nolan's cross our interest

11:02.480 --> 11:04.630
was for Mike and Mark to look at it

11:04.630 --> 11:06.459
straight over here and see if the stone

11:06.459 --> 11:08.520
had actually been carved this is the

11:08.520 --> 11:11.470
headstone of the cross so where the arms

11:11.470 --> 11:13.800
and the stem intersect this is what Fred

11:13.800 --> 11:19.050
found in 1981 landowner and professional

11:19.050 --> 11:22.240
surveyor Fred Nolan discovered five

11:22.240 --> 11:24.220
large cone-shaped boulders on his

11:24.220 --> 11:26.430
property that formed a perfectly

11:26.430 --> 11:30.820
symmetrical cross that measured 720 by

11:30.820 --> 11:34.480
867 feet believing there could be

11:34.480 --> 11:37.200
something buried at the center Fred dug

11:37.200 --> 11:40.010
down and uncovered a sixth boulder that

11:40.010 --> 11:44.200
eerily resembled a large human head like

11:44.200 --> 11:46.410
right here that looks like it's been

11:46.410 --> 11:51.110
chiseled about here here here

11:51.110 --> 11:54.080
here here yeah looks like somebody

11:54.080 --> 11:59.220
shaped it although there are many who

11:59.220 --> 12:01.490
believe that the mysterious boulders on

12:01.490 --> 12:03.480
Fred Nolan's property were meant to

12:03.480 --> 12:06.970
represent a Templar cross there is

12:06.970 --> 12:09.851
another more ingenious theory one that

12:09.851 --> 12:11.899
suggests the boulders were carefully

12:11.899 --> 12:14.230
arranged to form what is known as the

12:14.230 --> 12:15.230
Tree of Life

12:15.230 --> 12:17.519
an ancient Hebraic symbol which

12:17.519 --> 12:20.380
represents the ten spiritual principles

12:20.380 --> 12:22.610
or semi roads that are contained in

12:22.610 --> 12:26.120
God's creation of the universe this is

12:26.120 --> 12:29.310
it this theory was given further

12:29.310 --> 12:31.760
credence when a number of smaller

12:31.760 --> 12:34.830
strangely flat-sided stones were found

12:34.830 --> 12:36.900
at the exact places around the cross

12:36.900 --> 12:39.770
when this fe rock would be located what

12:39.770 --> 12:41.920
this interesting is it's rounded on the

12:41.920 --> 12:43.620
back yeah

12:43.620 --> 12:50.130
and kind of heard you have to look at it

12:50.130 --> 12:52.070
looking down but it's the impression

12:52.070 --> 12:54.040
that you know you can see that this

12:54.040 --> 12:55.810
would be where the I would be in the

12:55.810 --> 12:59.410
nose in the mouth and there's an

12:59.410 --> 13:01.680
indentation here you can see right here

13:01.680 --> 13:03.530
although it has weather where you could

13:03.530 --> 13:05.870
put like a small naval Cutlass or naval

13:05.870 --> 13:11.220
sorted like this is the blade part now

13:11.220 --> 13:12.769
again it's weathered a lot and it was

13:12.769 --> 13:15.150
much more defined years ago when I first

13:15.150 --> 13:18.920
saw it about 20-some years ago what's

13:18.920 --> 13:20.560
unique about this is it's it's

13:20.560 --> 13:21.710
completely different from the other

13:21.710 --> 13:23.440
stones the other stones are basically

13:23.440 --> 13:25.350
granted and they're cone shape or this

13:25.350 --> 13:28.200
one is obviously much flatter the

13:28.200 --> 13:31.330
suspicion is that the face especially

13:31.330 --> 13:34.540
the eye perhaps was looking at an area

13:34.540 --> 13:35.540
of significance

13:35.540 --> 13:37.970
that's our suspicion we're hopeful that

13:37.970 --> 13:39.580
Mike and Mark will be able to give us

13:39.580 --> 13:42.350
some information from the stones you

13:42.350 --> 13:44.060
know might it leave the treasure I don't

13:44.060 --> 13:45.910
know might lead to other discovery

13:45.910 --> 13:48.130
agendas I don't know we have to start

13:48.130 --> 13:51.120
somewhere and place to start is with

13:51.120 --> 13:54.209
experts any idea what type of stone this

13:54.209 --> 13:56.980
is is this sandstone things I sense them

13:56.980 --> 13:58.560
because Fred's always assumed that it

13:58.560 --> 14:00.870
was sandstone yeah as opposed to the

14:00.870 --> 14:02.000
other points on the cross are all

14:02.000 --> 14:04.649
granted you know

14:04.649 --> 14:06.670
Charlie do you remember the face being

14:06.670 --> 14:08.399
any more exaggerated than it currently

14:08.399 --> 14:10.529
is well certainly the indentation I've

14:10.529 --> 14:12.399
got a you know Fred very kindly let me

14:12.399 --> 14:15.910
take a photo of the headstone and

14:15.910 --> 14:18.330
certainly the Cutlass indentation was

14:18.330 --> 14:20.850
much more defined than it is now like I

14:20.850 --> 14:22.480
said over the years a weathered and

14:22.480 --> 14:24.140
unfortunately awesome nature Assad soon

14:24.140 --> 14:27.149
it will wither quickly given the fact

14:27.149 --> 14:29.470
that it's been exposed and was buried it

14:29.470 --> 14:32.740
was reactivated then buried again moved

14:32.740 --> 14:34.430
around doesn't take long for that for

14:34.430 --> 14:36.860
the sandstone to to erode and get rid of

14:36.860 --> 14:38.880
any indications or any markings whether

14:38.880 --> 14:41.019
it was work just difficult safe

14:41.019 --> 14:43.959
curiosity of course is its orientation

14:43.959 --> 14:45.440
at the intersection of the stem of the

14:45.440 --> 14:47.180
cross and the arm of the cross according

14:47.180 --> 14:49.110
to Fred survey data it's less than a

14:49.110 --> 14:51.430
degree off of perpendicular and this is

14:51.430 --> 14:52.839
at that point

14:52.839 --> 14:56.790
and then of course the carving the fact

14:56.790 --> 14:58.440
that it was right at the intersection I

14:58.440 --> 15:00.370
mean Mother Nature is good but I don't

15:00.370 --> 15:01.970
think she's that good I think it was put

15:01.970 --> 15:04.160
there for a purpose you know obviously

15:04.160 --> 15:06.160
and in so did Freddie I mean you're

15:06.160 --> 15:08.320
talking massive weight you know to

15:08.320 --> 15:11.090
maneuver this into position and a COPI

15:11.090 --> 15:14.240
partly not for shape a few edges knocked

15:14.240 --> 15:15.570
off air and there it's just something

15:15.570 --> 15:16.570
that they were looking for and they

15:16.570 --> 15:18.190
found this piece and it suit their

15:18.190 --> 15:19.750
purpose to me I think it's a calling

15:19.750 --> 15:23.830
card to me it's a come look at me and at

15:23.830 --> 15:25.540
this point we don't know what's that the

15:25.540 --> 15:27.500
Cutlass that was mostly notice or

15:27.500 --> 15:29.290
someone was supposed to notice or wasn't

15:29.290 --> 15:31.270
the face we don't know when and where it

15:31.270 --> 15:33.459
was done and then interventions at any

15:33.459 --> 15:35.930
particular time right yeah the curious

15:35.930 --> 15:38.720
thing is I for my part I've never seen

15:38.720 --> 15:40.970
no I'm not a geologist by for my part

15:40.970 --> 15:42.710
I've wandered the island quite a bit it

15:42.710 --> 15:46.260
I don't recall a piece of sense on this

15:46.260 --> 15:50.220
big anywhere that surface flauta granite

15:50.220 --> 15:53.660
a lot of big boulders not this

15:53.660 --> 15:55.970
we appreciate you looking at it and we

15:55.970 --> 15:58.149
were just looking for answers and that

15:58.149 --> 16:00.160
the clues as to whether or not was a

16:00.160 --> 16:02.240
human construct have been those clues

16:02.240 --> 16:04.139
have been lost but we do have one more

16:04.139 --> 16:11.160
rock we would like to show you
because

16:11.160 --> 16:13.540
it's set in stone subject to weathering

16:13.540 --> 16:16.589
at a rapid pace they could not make a

16:16.589 --> 16:18.800
definitive statement about the face

16:18.800 --> 16:21.029
stone they couldn't say yes or no

16:21.029 --> 16:25.100
okay gentlemen we're gonna get out here

16:25.100 --> 16:26.980
and we're gonna look at the bottom of

16:26.980 --> 16:29.519
the cross if you will if it was standing

16:29.519 --> 16:32.220
upright and it's a cone-shaped granite

16:32.220 --> 16:35.630
boulder possibly you know uppers to five

16:35.630 --> 16:38.090
tons in size and just take a look at it

16:38.090 --> 16:39.860
and give us your impression

16:39.860 --> 16:42.000
this is it right here

16:42.000 --> 16:53.800
again they're all they're all grown at

16:53.800 --> 16:55.990
the five stones and they're all shaped

16:55.990 --> 16:59.160
like this the question is that they find

16:59.160 --> 17:01.490
if stolen close to what they need and

17:01.490 --> 17:04.750
maybe just do some a little bit of you

17:04.750 --> 17:07.299
know tweaking right exactly

17:07.299 --> 17:11.839
or was this actually manipulated I don't

17:15.839 --> 17:25.459
think is natural at all I don't know

17:25.459 --> 17:26.890
what it is but it doesn't pair natural

17:26.890 --> 17:36.570
I've never seen anything quite like this

17:36.570 --> 17:41.770
I don't see that being natural that's

17:41.770 --> 17:43.900
really smooth Mike don't you think I

17:43.900 --> 17:45.540
don't know what it is but there's a

17:45.540 --> 17:47.670
paradox right near the middle of Oak

17:47.670 --> 17:48.670
Island

17:48.670 --> 17:50.530
on property belonging to the family of

17:50.530 --> 17:53.380
Fred Nolan local stonemasons monkfish

17:53.380 --> 17:56.450
here and Mike Whalen may have just found

17:56.450 --> 17:58.880
an important clue on the bottom Boulder

17:58.880 --> 18:01.640
of the megalithic formation known as

18:01.640 --> 18:05.040
Nolan's cross that surface is unusually

18:05.040 --> 18:07.530
smooth here and it would take a lot of a

18:07.530 --> 18:09.110
lot of dragging to get a central's that

18:09.110 --> 18:13.360
smooth really hmm what does that whether

18:13.360 --> 18:15.299
it was what does that tell you maybe it

18:15.299 --> 18:17.330
was in transport yeah something's

18:17.330 --> 18:19.600
happened to that surface of the stone

18:19.600 --> 18:22.130
the granite is rough the whole stone and

18:22.130 --> 18:23.510
yet at the bottom

18:23.510 --> 18:26.030
it was smooth if these stones had been

18:26.030 --> 18:28.060
drugged for long distance to position in

18:28.060 --> 18:30.299
this particular place I mean that's an

18:30.299 --> 18:33.730
aha moment I did not know this about

18:33.730 --> 18:35.059
this don't know it's not natural

18:35.059 --> 18:37.940
but as to when it was done is that he

18:37.940 --> 18:38.940
was guest

18:38.940 --> 18:42.340
if you drug a stone like that down like

18:42.340 --> 18:43.919
a gravel path you'd almost get a finish

18:43.919 --> 18:45.900
like that if you went long on that

18:45.900 --> 18:48.200
that's interesting that's very

18:48.200 --> 18:49.830
interesting it was the game how do you

18:49.830 --> 18:52.430
move or such a large stone and if that

18:52.430 --> 18:56.610
is possibly the result of transport as

18:56.610 --> 19:00.390
you indicate they had to have a way to

19:00.390 --> 19:01.910
move this thing

19:01.910 --> 19:03.080
it's almost a footprint if you were to

19:03.080 --> 19:06.160
drag it yeah yeah yeah

19:06.160 --> 19:10.330
Oh Cohen is a thousand-piece puzzle with

19:10.330 --> 19:11.330
500 pieces missing

19:11.330 --> 19:13.549
yeah and you just added one yeah let me

19:13.549 --> 19:15.290
thank you for that thank you fastest

19:15.290 --> 19:16.290
happy to help

19:16.290 --> 19:19.820
thank you happy to help okay let's uh on

19:19.820 --> 19:25.040
to more puzzles yeah yeah later that

19:25.040 --> 19:27.870
same day finally got the data back right

19:27.870 --> 19:28.870
breaker

19:28.870 --> 19:31.020
rick marty and members of the Oak Island

19:31.020 --> 19:33.780
team gather in the war room to hear the

19:33.780 --> 19:35.960
results of the carbon testing done on

19:35.960 --> 19:38.540
the mysterious pieces of wood discovered

19:38.540 --> 19:41.730
in the t-one chef at the money pit I'm

19:41.730 --> 19:44.470
very hopeful because of this piece of

19:44.470 --> 19:46.000
wood this piece of wood in that piece of

19:46.000 --> 19:50.809
wood we want proper dates but you only

19:50.809 --> 19:54.059
get a probability curve and you know if

19:54.059 --> 19:56.610
the probability curves are lean towards

19:56.610 --> 20:01.610
the early years fantastic

20:01.610 --> 20:03.789
everything's in the first one is the

20:03.789 --> 20:06.530
timber at 102 feet which is this guy

20:06.530 --> 20:12.200
right here the 95 percentile range is

20:12.200 --> 20:19.919
anywhere from 16 72 1780 what good times

20:19.919 --> 20:25.220
a wooden timber dating as far back as

20:25.220 --> 20:27.090
1670 ad

20:27.090 --> 20:30.210
could this be proof that the team has at

20:30.210 --> 20:33.030
long last found the location of the

20:33.030 --> 20:38.400
original money pit logos from 1655 to

20:38.400 --> 20:42.210
1695 well that's pretty good then isn't

20:42.210 --> 20:45.220
yeah it's this one that's intriguing

20:45.220 --> 20:46.990
yeah that one might be one of the

20:46.990 --> 20:49.049
original logs that covered the money pit

20:49.049 --> 20:50.960
more helpful right there wasn't just

20:50.960 --> 20:52.770
that that intrigued us it's incredibly

20:52.770 --> 20:53.770
heavy yeah

20:53.770 --> 20:56.940
even as I continued to read about Oak

20:56.940 --> 20:59.251
Island and the description of the money

20:59.251 --> 21:02.570
pit in my mind I'm thinking Oh logs

21:02.570 --> 21:04.770
embedded in the walls I'm talking oak

21:04.770 --> 21:09.169
logs but here's this much smaller

21:09.169 --> 21:12.490
dimensioned log is it part of the

21:12.490 --> 21:15.280
construct of the money pit could it be

21:15.280 --> 21:16.840
yeah because they weren't meant to

21:16.840 --> 21:19.760
support anything they were simply meant

21:19.760 --> 21:22.580
to separate so that each level could

21:22.580 --> 21:26.860
fall independently of the one above it

21:26.860 --> 21:31.919
could this be one of those maybe

21:31.919 --> 21:33.920
your father's always said darkened wood

21:33.920 --> 21:37.770
blackened wood with an order and that

21:37.770 --> 21:40.890
has to be oak clinic so I mean the

21:40.890 --> 21:43.530
greens on that or well won't can have

21:43.530 --> 21:45.790
white green but it's very hard till got

21:45.790 --> 21:48.090
branches are sticking out right so there

21:48.090 --> 21:49.240
would have been number the original

21:49.240 --> 21:52.450
money pit was described as logs of home

21:52.450 --> 21:56.990
yeah anyway so what's this test I know

21:56.990 --> 22:01.850
this one tested from sixteen fifty five

22:01.850 --> 22:05.890
to sixty ninety five well then that

22:05.890 --> 22:08.970
means that one is holed then you've got

22:08.970 --> 22:10.100
something that's not the kind of

22:10.100 --> 22:12.490
material that anybody used for any of

22:12.490 --> 22:15.980
the shafts and Craig thanks and I think

22:15.980 --> 22:18.710
maybe he could be right that that would

22:18.710 --> 22:20.240
have been one of the logs of the

22:20.240 --> 22:24.330
ten-foot platforms so that would be very

22:24.330 --> 22:27.210
significant well this is sounding like

22:27.210 --> 22:30.480
that almost has to be original yeah

22:30.480 --> 22:32.420
that's what this is implying yes right

22:32.420 --> 22:35.070
there the original money pit yeah maybe

22:35.070 --> 22:36.940
we're zeroing in on it yeah it could

22:36.940 --> 22:39.390
have been Spanish or it could have been

22:39.390 --> 22:42.160
pirates the bridge murder Sh

22:42.160 --> 22:43.890
that fits once again with this sort of

22:43.890 --> 22:47.770
British military for their jet 1762 were

22:47.770 --> 22:49.710
prior very much more interested in what

22:49.710 --> 22:51.790
the hammer grab might bring up yeah this

22:51.790 --> 22:53.169
we're gonna continue to hammer grab we

22:53.169 --> 22:56.179
need to have eyes on it all the time

22:56.179 --> 22:58.380
yeah okay so now I got more sitting to

22:58.380 --> 23:00.280
doing that front-end loader oh you poor

23:00.280 --> 23:01.309
boy I know

23:01.309 --> 23:05.610
fuck it was a great great meeting thanks

23:05.610 --> 23:06.610
for the day to Prague

23:06.610 --> 23:09.280
I'm very hopeful song I want to go back

23:09.280 --> 23:10.570
out there I'm sure you guys do too so

23:10.570 --> 23:12.440
let's get after it okay

23:21.040 --> 23:27.809
or quite after receiving test results

23:27.809 --> 23:29.750
indicating that they may be close to

23:29.750 --> 23:31.820
finding the exact location of the

23:31.820 --> 23:34.880
original money pit Savior our Castle

23:34.880 --> 23:37.400
Rock Rick Marty and the team have

23:37.400 --> 23:39.990
returned to the t-one worksite only to

23:39.990 --> 23:42.809
discover that today's findings are less

23:42.809 --> 23:47.539
than encouraging they should be pulling

23:47.539 --> 23:49.630
up more bits of wood and evidence of

23:49.630 --> 23:53.150
manmade workings deep underground

23:53.150 --> 23:55.700
instead they are now finding only bits

23:55.700 --> 23:59.659
of clay and chunks of stone the hope is

23:59.659 --> 24:01.419
when you dig in the money pit you dig

24:01.419 --> 24:04.370
into something that's unambiguous a

24:04.370 --> 24:07.220
vault with gold coins or bars or

24:07.220 --> 24:09.570
parchment documents or whatever I mean

24:09.570 --> 24:10.770
when you do that it wouldn't be

24:10.770 --> 24:11.770
confusing would it let's talk to Andrew

24:11.770 --> 24:15.630
we're in a drawer and gentlemen how are

24:15.630 --> 24:18.910
ya good are you yeah

24:18.910 --> 24:21.840
good all right talk to us you know the

24:21.840 --> 24:23.980
drill we are a hundred and forty eight

24:23.980 --> 24:28.220
feet with the can and we're at 147 148

24:28.220 --> 24:30.900
with the diggin okay so we're going one

24:30.900 --> 24:32.890
for one right now go ahead we're gonna

24:32.890 --> 24:34.600
get would it be right now we're gonna

24:34.600 --> 24:37.440
hit what it's gonna be this bucket 
right now

25:13.909 --> 25:15.950
they just say it but I don't think

25:15.950 --> 25:17.419
there's anything there I feel the

25:17.419 --> 25:19.580
pressure as each hammer grab comes out

25:19.580 --> 25:22.039
because I just kept coming up with clay

25:22.039 --> 25:24.090
certainly nothing definitively man-made

25:24.090 --> 25:25.799
maari's absolutely right I mean there

25:25.799 --> 25:31.809
was nothing definitive about it

25:39.409 --> 25:42.600
nothing it never stopped I mean there

25:42.600 --> 25:44.880
was hammer grab after hammer grab after

25:44.980 --> 25:47.230
hammer grab of clay I tell you what Rick

25:47.230 --> 25:50.020
this place could annoy the del I llama I

25:50.020 --> 25:52.210
mean for God's sake you know right about

25:52.210 --> 25:54.220
we're right where we want to be right

25:54.220 --> 26:01.030
where we bloody wanna be none of this

26:01.030 --> 26:02.150
makes sense

26:02.150 --> 26:04.503
oh this is outside the purview of logic

26:04.503 --> 26:05.503
amen

26:05.503 --> 26:06.503
a Rick and I and the team agreed on a

26:06.503 --> 26:07.503
budget for this year and we're running

26:07.503 --> 26:09.100
out we tried to stretch that budget and

26:09.100 --> 26:12.250
decided to go for the t1 well but we

26:12.250 --> 26:13.679
haven't had that breakthrough yet

26:13.679 --> 26:18.559
there's the operative word yet okay yes

26:18.559 --> 26:20.100
I just think that there's something very

26:20.100 --> 26:23.059
significant here if this doesn't work

26:23.059 --> 26:25.860
I'm a measure twice cut once guy if we

26:25.860 --> 26:28.770
have to go to a much larger scale

26:28.770 --> 26:31.080
investigation I'm willing vo there we

26:31.080 --> 26:32.080
need answers

26:32.080 --> 26:35.200
Wow

26:35.200 --> 26:40.309
finding water in the t-one shaft is

26:40.309 --> 26:43.000
hardly surprising the absence of any

26:43.000 --> 26:45.309
wood and seems to indicate that the team

26:45.309 --> 26:47.440
may have reached yet another dead end

26:47.440 --> 26:54.289
there he goes a totally empty

26:54.289 --> 27:02.150
very little of nothing

27:02.150 --> 27:05.940
so guys right now we're down about 156

27:05.940 --> 27:10.140
with a cannon

27:10.140 --> 27:17.120
anyway you could be on metal

27:17.120 --> 27:18.549
Charles there have been reports of

27:18.549 --> 27:20.960
plates of metal that other explorers

27:20.960 --> 27:26.049
could not get through true absolutely in

27:26.049 --> 27:28.520
1897 after discovering a mysterious

27:28.520 --> 27:32.419
7-foot tall wooden vault some 153 feet

27:32.419 --> 27:35.280
deep inside the money pit treasure

27:35.280 --> 27:37.409
hunter William Chappell located what

27:37.409 --> 27:39.690
appeared to be an impenetrable metal

27:39.690 --> 27:43.730
object at a depth of approximately 171

27:43.730 --> 27:47.200
feet could Rick Marty and the team have

27:47.200 --> 27:49.000
located another such plate

27:49.000 --> 27:51.630
if so who put it there

27:51.630 --> 27:56.180
what might it be protecting we're hoping

27:56.180 --> 27:57.990
that maybe what's killing these teeth

27:57.990 --> 28:00.240
could be a metal plate how fat you've

28:00.240 --> 28:02.981
hammered on it yeah and you know and we

28:02.981 --> 28:05.559
should see some indication if that's the

28:05.559 --> 28:08.050
case absolutely let the big dog eat

28:08.050 --> 28:09.050
again

28:09.050 --> 28:11.350
put mr. pac-man in there

28:11.350 --> 28:16.679
give it a couple foot drop try to stab

28:16.679 --> 28:20.820
it and grip it and rip it

28:20.820 --> 28:24.960
all right last chance here we go

28:24.960 --> 28:28.970
there you go ready do a happy dance

28:28.970 --> 28:29.970
Charles

28:29.970 --> 28:40.580
come on minute

28:40.580 --> 28:48.250
last chance

28:48.250 --> 28:51.080
the next draft comes and I'm hoping that

28:51.080 --> 28:52.809
what's happening is we're clipping a big

28:52.809 --> 28:55.280
piece of metal where do you want it Rick

28:55.280 --> 28:57.890
he wants it on the ground

28:57.890 --> 29:01.490
the chapel expedition drilled into

29:01.490 --> 29:04.270
something that they described very like

29:04.270 --> 29:10.220
that if we're hitting the metal plate

29:10.220 --> 29:14.490
that's exciting that would be great

29:14.490 --> 29:25.170
like a slate though

29:25.170 --> 29:33.180
that's not good

29:33.180 --> 29:37.770
if we hit bedrock bennett's it's over

29:37.770 --> 29:41.320
it's not gonna go down and your mind

29:41.320 --> 29:43.790
goes from wow this is what I really want

29:43.790 --> 29:46.090
it to be and it is and then it goes to

29:46.090 --> 29:48.850
the harsh reality of oh no it's not

29:48.850 --> 29:53.419
then another question it raises its head

29:53.419 --> 29:56.159
in that is what do we do we're on

29:56.159 --> 30:00.370
bedrock it's time to terminate that's it

30:00.370 --> 30:03.670
we're done

30:03.670 --> 30:09.140
we're done what began as a date of eager

30:09.140 --> 30:12.230
anticipation has suddenly turned to one

30:12.230 --> 30:15.260
a bitter disappointment for Rick Marty

30:15.260 --> 30:20.660
and the team after spending the last of

30:20.660 --> 30:22.980
this year's engineering budget trying to

30:22.980 --> 30:25.779
find the original money pit they have

30:25.779 --> 30:28.080
literally hit bottom and there are no

30:28.080 --> 30:31.520
more options left so I'm disappointed I

30:31.520 --> 30:33.799
mean that's all we've got is interesting

30:33.799 --> 30:35.610
pieces of wood after three very

30:35.610 --> 30:37.970
expensive digs in the money pit we hope

30:37.970 --> 30:41.640
to encounter the vault and come up with

30:41.640 --> 30:45.590
metal in pieces and metal bars so I'm

30:45.590 --> 30:48.590
disappointed but it'd be nice to find it

30:48.590 --> 30:51.159
you know do the happy dance right here

30:51.159 --> 30:52.980
yeah I'd love to see my brother on top

30:52.980 --> 30:58.809
the vault but it didn't happen

30:58.809 --> 31:00.650
difference between being disappointed

31:00.650 --> 31:02.840
and being dissuaded from continuing

31:02.840 --> 31:05.180
there's no guarantee on Oak Island you

31:05.180 --> 31:07.010
do what you can you persevere in the

31:07.010 --> 31:09.750
face of adversity and you carry on look

31:09.750 --> 31:13.040
here's the thing I got more data I think

31:13.040 --> 31:15.770
what we need to do is get all this data

31:15.770 --> 31:17.250
you know and take a look

31:17.250 --> 31:19.610
so our Rick look I appreciate the

31:19.610 --> 31:23.440
optimism we just sank three three-man

31:23.440 --> 31:26.159
size shafts into the money pit and then

31:26.159 --> 31:28.070
come up with anything

31:28.070 --> 31:31.149
counter that with 222 years well we have

31:31.149 --> 31:33.649
they didn't have this

31:33.649 --> 31:38.720
we're not gonna quit it's here why are

31:38.720 --> 31:40.500
you so convinced

31:40.500 --> 31:42.840
because they were convinced all of the

31:42.840 --> 31:43.840
work ants

31:43.840 --> 31:46.429
why was Fred blaring ball from 1893 to

31:46.429 --> 31:49.800
1951 and he wasn't convinced what was in

31:49.800 --> 31:52.059
my shop they all had to believe

31:52.059 --> 31:54.149
otherwise what was the point of them

31:54.149 --> 31:56.620
being here nobody wants you guys to find

31:56.620 --> 31:59.799
it more than I do

31:59.799 --> 32:01.850
I think it's quiet contemplation time

32:01.850 --> 32:04.289
let's uh let's just go have a think

32:04.289 --> 32:15.929
about all this let's go

32:15.929 --> 32:18.940
tough deal Rick tough deal mm-hmm let's

32:18.940 --> 32:20.850
call Craig all is not lost

32:20.850 --> 32:28.690
no Krieger well by this time you are

32:28.690 --> 32:34.250
aware that we have now dug three very

32:34.250 --> 32:38.320
deep very expensive very large holes in

32:38.320 --> 32:44.440
the money pit but no vault no treasure

32:44.440 --> 32:47.410
so just stating facts here to use a

32:47.410 --> 32:51.840
baseball analogy that's three strikes

32:51.840 --> 32:54.490
usually you're out but it's only the

32:54.490 --> 32:56.460
eighth and the game would be over over

32:56.460 --> 32:58.179
the bottom of the ninth it's only the

32:58.179 --> 33:00.399
bottom of the eighth is that your call

33:00.399 --> 33:04.480
I mean I'm still hopeful and I'm

33:04.480 --> 33:07.970
interested going to the southwest and

33:07.970 --> 33:11.880
then we continue pushing a hold on while

33:11.880 --> 33:14.669
the gears here that's my thought you

33:14.669 --> 33:23.130
want to do this yeah I do

33:23.130 --> 33:25.100
you are certainly a perpetual optimist

33:25.100 --> 33:30.230
big brother

33:30.230 --> 33:31.900
I don't want to be part of leaving the

33:31.900 --> 33:33.149
stone unturned

33:33.149 --> 33:35.891
but this is getting painful you know

33:35.891 --> 33:45.430
you know there has to be and enough seen

33:45.430 --> 33:46.430
off

33:46.430 --> 33:52.250
Rick let me tell you I was probably the

33:52.250 --> 33:55.660
most excited to put these holes down and

33:55.660 --> 33:58.690
the money pit but not a lot of treasure

33:58.690 --> 34:04.309
to show for it no but information surely

34:04.309 --> 34:06.030
it's had its rewards certainly but maybe

34:06.030 --> 34:07.919
we're done with the money pit

34:07.919 --> 34:12.699
no cuz no I'll be honest no I refuse to

34:12.699 --> 34:14.649
use the word failure we now have a

34:14.649 --> 34:18.030
greater understanding of the underground

34:18.030 --> 34:20.719
in the money pit area but is the money

34:20.719 --> 34:23.539
pit a tough nut you bet it is does it

34:23.539 --> 34:25.389
live up to its name

34:25.389 --> 34:27.179
absolutely but there's still

34:27.179 --> 34:31.049
opportunities here I mean you know it's

34:31.049 --> 34:34.049
the same old sorry topic of money it's a

34:34.049 --> 34:36.339
reality you know but I think we can I

34:36.339 --> 34:38.440
think we can do it I think we take

34:38.440 --> 34:40.609
another look at the monies that are

34:40.609 --> 34:42.539
available and I think there's a way to

34:42.539 --> 34:43.539
make it happen

34:43.539 --> 34:52.659
Greg where are you for me I put in

34:52.659 --> 34:56.469
what's needed to do one more I just want

34:56.469 --> 35:00.339
to ask Rick one question

35:00.339 --> 35:02.109
I want to leave here with having done a

35:02.109 --> 35:04.190
damn good try but your criteria has

35:04.190 --> 35:06.180
always been you don't want to leave here

35:06.180 --> 35:09.130
with regrets are you gonna have regrets

35:09.130 --> 35:12.130
if we don't dig this hole

35:12.130 --> 35:13.760
in my relationship with record there's a

35:13.760 --> 35:16.671
strong bond both of us know that if we

35:16.671 --> 35:18.150
fell in a deep hole the other one would

35:18.150 --> 35:20.769
go in and get the person who fell I mean

35:20.769 --> 35:22.009
that's that's just the things just as

35:22.009 --> 35:24.680
confidence that they're there for you

35:24.680 --> 35:26.800
that's the strong bond between us and I

35:26.800 --> 35:32.380
respect that I'm kind of feeling shifted

35:32.380 --> 35:35.670
towards doing it but you know what

35:35.670 --> 35:37.210
Charles has picked my hole Craig has

35:37.210 --> 35:39.300
picked the hole I think the final

35:39.300 --> 35:48.390
position of this one should be yours
you

35:48.390 --> 35:50.309
me Alex

35:50.309 --> 35:54.180
and Mom and Dad so let's name it for our

35:54.180 --> 35:56.710
parents let's call it the george and and

35:56.710 --> 36:02.940
lagina number one gal gal number one you

36:02.940 --> 36:05.630
alright with it mom was quite a gal

36:05.630 --> 36:08.489
alright I like it I'm on board

36:08.489 --> 36:10.089
alright let's dig one more but you don't

36:10.089 --> 36:12.049
want we got things to do then we got to

36:12.049 --> 36:14.329
pick the bloody site yeah well I have an

36:14.329 --> 36:17.999
idea but I want everybody to weigh in

36:17.999 --> 36:19.690
I'm excited about the fourth hole

36:19.690 --> 36:22.739
because I've always thought why chase

36:22.739 --> 36:26.319
one singular target Torian go read the

36:26.319 --> 36:29.910
written history says that in 1861 there

36:29.910 --> 36:32.549
were three quote unquote thunderous

36:32.549 --> 36:35.559
collapses in the money pit there's this

36:35.559 --> 36:37.690
imposing location of the money pit right

36:37.690 --> 36:40.210
there when that happens that explosively

36:40.210 --> 36:43.150
the material in that chamber is going to

36:43.150 --> 36:47.019
be dispersed over a wide area chase that

36:47.019 --> 36:49.299
chase the debris field the flood tunnel

36:49.299 --> 36:50.910
comes in from the north

36:50.910 --> 36:52.819
the water's coming in for this direction

36:52.819 --> 36:55.320
well you have been already thinking

36:55.320 --> 37:03.640
about this brother in 1861 12 years

37:03.640 --> 37:05.309
after the discovery of what many

37:05.309 --> 37:07.759
believed to be two stacked wooden chests

37:07.759 --> 37:10.220
filled with gold a team of treasure

37:10.220 --> 37:12.520
hunters trying to reach the bottom of

37:12.520 --> 37:14.660
the original money pit by digging an

37:14.660 --> 37:18.180
adjacent shaft and a depth of 118 feet

37:18.180 --> 37:22.559
the shaft known as shaft number six

37:22.559 --> 37:23.940
began filling with seawater

37:23.940 --> 37:29.609
shortly afterwards a series of loud

37:29.609 --> 37:32.000
crashes were heard leaving the workers

37:32.000 --> 37:34.269
to speculate that the wood cribbing in

37:34.269 --> 37:36.559
the money pit had collapsed and that

37:36.559 --> 37:38.509
whatever possible treasure lay at the

37:38.509 --> 37:41.229
bottom was now scattered across a vast

37:41.229 --> 37:48.359
underground and underwater debris field

37:48.359 --> 37:51.529
so money pit collapses the debris field

37:51.529 --> 37:54.190
goes this way I'd go right in there

37:54.190 --> 37:58.650
right here that's where we drill right

37:58.650 --> 38:03.660
there he's saying seven feet south four

38:03.660 --> 38:08.450
feet west of v3 bottom hole let's go do

38:08.450 --> 38:09.450
it

38:09.450 --> 38:11.990
thanks Greg take care thanks thanks

38:11.990 --> 38:13.700
okay I like that a lot that makes me

38:13.700 --> 38:15.109
feel a lot better

38:15.109 --> 38:17.099
q k to choose a hole on Oak Island I

38:17.099 --> 38:21.499
mean nobody deserves that more than you

38:21.499 --> 38:23.640
nobody has put their soul into this like

38:23.640 --> 38:26.789
you have nobody has been less self

38:26.789 --> 38:31.959
aggrandizing than you look he deserve it

38:31.959 --> 38:35.930
it is as simple as that

38:35.930 --> 38:37.759
well thanks

38:37.759 --> 38:42.730
so anyway you do it together

38:42.730 --> 38:47.049
ever since he first read about it as an

38:47.049 --> 38:50.190
11 year old boy it has been Rick lagina

38:50.190 --> 38:52.769
stream to solve the Oak Island mystery

38:52.769 --> 38:56.079
it is a dream that has been with him for

38:56.079 --> 38:59.880
more than 50 years and one that he

for some the curse of Oak Island comes

40:36.289 --> 40:38.769
in the form of death caused by

40:38.769 --> 40:40.130
unforeseen calamity

40:40.130 --> 40:44.910
but for others it comes in the form of

40:44.910 --> 40:49.121
fierce determination fueled by faith and

40:49.121 --> 40:51.059
tempered by the likelihood that too much

40:51.059 --> 40:53.740
has already been discovered for anyone

40:53.740 --> 40:56.180
to give up now

40:56.180 --> 40:58.670
