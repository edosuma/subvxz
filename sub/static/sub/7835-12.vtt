01:27.671 --> 01:30.131
A
- ha! A free baseball!

01:31.133 --> 01:33.342
A shiny new dime!

01:34.636 --> 01:36.345
A shinier new dime!

01:36.680 --> 01:41.434
Excuse me. My refrigeration
unit is broken.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.937
Could you possibly eat
some free ice cream?

01:45.022 --> 01:49.400
What flavor? Why, super
chocolate, of course. Oh, yes!

01:50.527 --> 01:53.112
This day just keeps
getting better and better.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.698
And here's a new
four-legged friend for me.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.159
Hiya, boy. Haven't seen
you around here before.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.378
Mom! A dog ate my clothes!

02:10.547 --> 02:13.299
Nice try, but we're
still going to Riverdance.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.383
D'oh!

02:15.010 --> 02:18.721
You know that new baby brother
Ralph's been bragging about?

02:18.972 --> 02:21.140
It's just a pinecone.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.317
Let's go where it's quiet.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.443
Help!

02:32.778 --> 02:34.153
Isn't that your brother?

02:34.238 --> 02:35.822
I said, let's go.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.534
Eh, I'm sick of this Tarzan movie.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.578
Dad, it's a documentary on the homeless.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.746
Oh, right.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.624
A crazy dog's trying to kill me!

02:46.708 --> 02:48.918
Really? Ooh! This I gotta see.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.381
Oh, he just wants to make friends.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.719
Ooh! Who's a good dog?
What a goody doggie!

03:00.347 --> 03:01.347
He just a googie...

03:01.431 --> 03:04.183
So, Bart, when does the killing start?

03:16.697 --> 03:20.449
Look, Bart, sometimes dogs or
people hate you for no reason.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.847
Bart's a goner.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.724
Anyone want to be my new best friend?

03:44.808 --> 03:45.850
I will!

03:45.934 --> 03:49.520
Great! Finally, I'll
be the dominant one.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.063
Be quiet.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.273
Yes, sir.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.486
Ha-ha! Bart's family is poor!

04:10.000 --> 04:13.085
Hurry up, Bart, or you'll be
late to be killed by the dog!

04:13.170 --> 04:14.128
What?

04:14.212 --> 04:15.880
I said you'll be late for school!

04:24.014 --> 04:26.724
Eat my short stories!

04:59.174 --> 05:04.345
Phew! Safe at last! Now, I'll just
turn around and confirm that safety.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.481
Hey, wait a minute.
These animals are stuffed.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.858
Except that one.

05:19.486 --> 05:23.656
Don't worry about these critters.
They're just props from my movies.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.660
This one's from Gunfight at
the Museum of Natural History.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.161
You were in movies?

05:29.246 --> 05:33.332
Hold onto your hat, son.
You're talking to Buck McCoy.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.667
Who?

05:36.086 --> 05:38.462
Yeah, that's right. Buck McCoy.

05:38.547 --> 05:41.340
The most famous movie
cowboy in the world.

05:41.633 --> 05:45.636
No kidding. Anyway, I climbed
over your gate. A dog was after me.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.682
I'll show you a trick
that you can use on dogs.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.143
Also worked on David O. Selznick.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.352
Who?

05:53.437 --> 05:57.398
Yeah, that's right.
The David O. Selznick.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.278
Whoa! Keep him away from me!

06:02.362 --> 06:04.655
Trust me, son. You'll be fine.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.951
Now, lean down and put
your arms across his neck.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.208
Whoa! It worked!

06:18.503 --> 06:19.712
Where did you learn that?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.797
Ah, you pick things up.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.342
Do you know how to catch a
wild boar with a teaspoon?

06:25.427 --> 06:26.427
No!

06:26.511 --> 06:28.471
Well, what do you kids do all day?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.806
Well, right now I'm
supposed to be in school.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.018
School? Huh! Why bother?
I quit after fourth grade,

06:34.102 --> 06:35.978
and I ain't not no un-dummy.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.192
It's like you're living in a steakhouse!

06:41.276 --> 06:44.320
Well, thank you. Most
people just mutter that.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.657
Is that horse vacuuming?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.159
If you can call it that.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.912
He soils as much as he cleans.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.208
Frank the Wonder Horse
was in 24 of my pictures.

06:58.376 --> 07:03.339
And directed one. And he
got the "film by" credit.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.183
5:00? I better get home for dinner.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.352
Well, come back anytime, pardner.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.938
To the laundry room!

07:22.275 --> 07:23.359
Here we are.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.907
Hi, honey. Where's that vicious
dog? I made him a biscuit.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.827
Oh, he's not bothering me
anymore. Buck McCoy helped me.

07:32.911 --> 07:36.539
Buck McCoy? He was the
greatest of them all!

07:36.706 --> 07:38.332
He was bigger than opium!

07:38.416 --> 07:40.167
I met one of my heroes today.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.293
She started the first...

07:41.378 --> 07:44.338
Buck McCoy! I still carry this.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.884
Junior Buckaroo, 2nd Class.
Little Grampa Simpson.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.219
Cool!

07:52.430 --> 07:56.183
After that I starred in
Wyatt Earp Meets The Mummy.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.853
Then Six Brides For Seven Brothers.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.398
They were pictures that the
whole family could enjoy.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.234
No drugs, no nudity, no cussing.

08:05.569 --> 08:09.738
Just drinking, fighting and
tripping horses with wires.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.032
What's this lunchbox made of?

08:12.117 --> 08:15.327
Well, back in my day, we
had a thing called metal.

08:15.412 --> 08:19.915
Everything was made of it.
Lunchboxes, cars, you name it.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.084
Me-tal.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.171
Hey, can you still do cowboy tricks?

08:25.255 --> 08:28.424
Well, here's one I
did in The Wild Lunch.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.015
Everything tastes
better when it's lassoed!

08:37.100 --> 08:39.018
Would you lasso me a banana?

08:39.102 --> 08:41.854
Now how the hell would I do that?

08:43.899 --> 08:47.359
I guess you're not going to
have an adventure this week.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.944
Huh. Just you wait.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.446
Hey, boy, where'd you get that hat?

08:50.530 --> 08:51.614
Buck gave it to me.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.158
He's just about the
greatest guy who ever lived.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.994
I want to grow up to be just like him.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.164
No kidding? Hey, speaking of achievers,

09:00.457 --> 09:04.460
they're thinking of spraying your
old man's workspace for ticks.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.213
That's great, champ. I know
you've been wanting that.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.882
Well, got to mosey, Homer. Ma'am.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.928
Bart sure is fond of that cow gentleman.

09:14.012 --> 09:17.848
It's just not fair. This Buck
fellow's had all the advantages.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.852
Horse-riding lessons, the finest
makeup, delicious studio food.

09:21.937 --> 09:25.397
Oh, Homie, you'll always
be my western hero.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.649
Swell.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.403
I can't wait till I get good.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.949
Buck's here!

09:36.326 --> 09:37.701
Dad, why are you wearing that?

09:37.786 --> 09:39.411
Because I want to be your hero.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.914
On top of which, I don't look bald.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.335
Thanks for coming, Mr. McCoy.
We cooked your favorites.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.172
Rattlesnake meat, varmint
kabobs and refried whiskey.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.758
I like the sound of that last one.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.552
Don't listen to them,
Buck! It's an ambush!

09:55.637 --> 09:57.846
They're trying to jump your claim!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.682
Take him outside.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.351
I love you, Buck!

10:08.483 --> 10:11.652
Gee, Buck, your old films
are as violent as today's!

10:11.736 --> 10:13.862
One of the wheels broke
off my chair today,

10:13.947 --> 10:15.990
but I didn't make a movie about it.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.576
In the '50s, I did a TV show.

10:20.203 --> 10:24.123
It only lasted a year,
but we did 360 episodes,

10:24.207 --> 10:27.918
all of them great. I did
the commercials myself.

10:28.044 --> 10:33.465
Remember kids, Drunken Cowboy
brand whiskey is smooth as milk!

10:33.717 --> 10:36.719
I'm not sure I approve of
selling whiskey to children.

10:36.803 --> 10:40.014
Well, that ad was aimed at children
who were already heavy drinkers.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.098
Oh!

10:45.895 --> 10:49.481
Tonight's episode... "Excuse
Me While I Kill The Sky. "

10:49.566 --> 10:50.816
Why are you driving a car?

10:52.694 --> 10:56.989
Yeah, in the '70s, Westerns were
out and detective shows were in.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.908
It seems like all I
did was shoot hippies.

11:04.622 --> 11:08.042
They wrote me out of the
show and it became Room 222.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.170
So that's how you ended your career?

11:11.254 --> 11:13.339
Yeah, well, what can you do?

11:13.423 --> 11:17.176
The Western went the way of
the evening newspaper and polio.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.012
Well, I think Westerns
are due for a comeback.

11:20.096 --> 11:24.600
Yeah! We can have showdowns at the
schoolyard and use nerds as Indians.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.197
Bart, you look so cool.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.949
I was thinking this could be a new fad.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.285
What about Hawaiian shirts?

11:44.746 --> 11:47.081
Hey, you're not fun, you're fat!

11:47.332 --> 11:51.460
Now, listen up. When I come back
tomorrow, you better have cowboy suits,

11:51.544 --> 11:54.088
and they better be adorable.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.343
This is Kent Brockman here
at Springfield Elementary,

11:59.427 --> 12:02.596
where a new Western craze
is sweeping the campus.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.223
I'm Annie Oakley!

12:04.307 --> 12:07.309
I'm Kevin Costner in
one of his Western roles!

12:07.435 --> 12:08.894
I'm a gulch!

12:08.978 --> 12:10.437
So I guess you could say

12:10.688 --> 12:14.566
this barely qualifies as
news. I'm Kent Brockman.

12:15.777 --> 12:19.738
Oh, give me land Lots of land

12:19.823 --> 12:22.533
Under starry skies above

12:22.826 --> 12:25.869
Don't fence me in

12:26.162 --> 12:28.414
Sir, you cannot pee

12:28.498 --> 12:31.250
Unless you are an employee

12:32.001 --> 12:35.254
Can't keep it in

12:41.344 --> 12:45.848
Krusty, how do you feel about
putting Buck McCoy on your show?

12:46.182 --> 12:48.684
Pass! We also represent Billy Joel.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.227
Who's the first one again?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.437
Buck McCoy.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.606
Forget it! I'm not putting
some Western star on

12:54.691 --> 12:56.733
just 'cause it's the
flavor of the month.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.153
I want my show to have
a timeless quality.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.155
Here's your hanging chad sketch, Krusty.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.992
Oh, good, you worked in Judge Ito.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.536
Please put Buck on! He's my hero!

13:07.745 --> 13:09.580
Plus, he'll work for scale.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.373
Scale minus 10.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.544
I ain't going on some
clown show. I'm retired.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.297
No one expects you to
do anything difficult.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.174
They understand you're too old.

13:20.258 --> 13:25.429
Listen, missy. The last two city-slickers
who used reverse psychology on me

13:25.513 --> 13:27.389
are pushing up daisies.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.726
They're dead? No, they
just got lousy jobs.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.855
You know what? I bet he can't
even fit into his old costume.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.733
I can't, huh? You two wait right here.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.827
Let's see, Texas or Massachusetts?

13:48.912 --> 13:49.953
Texas.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.122
I like the way you think.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.102
Boy, that's some fancy shooting.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.896
Oh, I've seen fancier.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.402
Ooh! Right in the panhandle!

14:22.487 --> 14:24.071
Write that down.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.491
Buck, this is a real honor.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.245
I grew up watching your horse
operas down at the Bijou.

14:33.164 --> 14:36.375
Yeah, things sure have
changed since the '50s.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.043
I don't care.

14:38.127 --> 14:42.005
You know, it's been a long
time since I performed live.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.508
You'll do fine. Just remember,

14:44.592 --> 14:46.802
there'll be millions
of people watching you.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.807
Millions!

14:53.768 --> 14:57.145
And TV Guide's Cheers and Jeers editor.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.440
And he's already given
out all his cheers.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.778
Live from the corner of Zany Avenue

15:04.862 --> 15:06.071
and Martin Luther King Boulevard,

15:06.155 --> 15:07.614
it's The Krusty the Klown Show,

15:07.699 --> 15:09.199
with special guest Buck McCoy.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.577
And now, here's Krusty!

15:11.661 --> 15:13.829
We've got such a great show tonight.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.415
I won't be doing a monologue
because my feet hurt.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.417
And now our opening sketch.

15:21.504 --> 15:26.008
We don't take kindly to transvestite
chimpanzees here in Pine Corners!

15:27.844 --> 15:29.803
No one can save you now!

15:32.432 --> 15:36.977
I said, no one can save you now!

15:37.228 --> 15:39.396
Shut up! I'm coming!

15:41.357 --> 15:45.235
Oh! Like you're so perfect
with your plastic mane

15:45.320 --> 15:49.865
and your painted-on spot.
What's real on you? Nothing!

15:50.241 --> 15:51.450
He's drunk!

15:51.534 --> 15:53.035
I've seen drunker.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.163
Oh, right, yeah, the guns.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.174
We're free!

16:15.141 --> 16:17.142
These hilarious health professionals

16:17.226 --> 16:20.520
will cut me out of my
clothes after this commercial.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.231
What happened, Buck?

16:23.316 --> 16:26.276
Did I forget to mention
I'm an alcoholic?

16:32.241 --> 16:33.909
For shame.

16:37.372 --> 16:41.249
This is horrible. My spit-takes
all have blood in them.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.418
Look, I'm really sorry.

16:43.503 --> 16:47.255
Sorry don't suture my colon!
And you're off my show forever!

16:56.057 --> 16:59.434
Bart, I couldn't help
noticing Buck is a total fraud,

16:59.560 --> 17:03.271
so I took the liberty of
creating a new hero for your wall.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.441
That is just grotesque.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.319
I thought if you were
looking to worship someone,

17:09.404 --> 17:11.113
maybe it could be your old man.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.948
Eh. We could try it.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.407
Yes!

17:18.246 --> 17:20.038
My son lost his hero.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.708
This should be the
greatest night of my life.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.041
How come I'm not happy?

17:24.127 --> 17:25.752
You care about Bart's feelings.

17:25.837 --> 17:26.877
Stop saying that!

17:26.963 --> 17:29.589
I think we should try to
restore Bart's faith in Buck,

17:29.674 --> 17:32.050
and we could start by
getting Buck to quit drinking.

17:39.142 --> 17:43.770
I'm sorry I let your son down,
but I'm too old to change.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.564
Oh, listen to you!

17:45.648 --> 17:48.233
"I'm too old to change. "

17:49.569 --> 17:50.569
How old are you?

17:50.653 --> 17:51.778
Seventy-six.

17:51.863 --> 17:55.365
Nice old man. Don't break a hip.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.410
Have we gotten all the liquor?

17:58.494 --> 18:01.079
That painting is made of liquor.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.421
I was drinking so much I
forgot what life was about.

18:09.797 --> 18:13.842
Gold! Gold! Beautiful gold!

18:14.051 --> 18:16.261
Nuggets as big as your fists!

18:16.345 --> 18:19.681
You guys are sick. I don't belong here.

18:19.849 --> 18:24.102
Buck, if you walk out that door,
you'll be branded a quitter forever.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.816
Mmm!

18:29.901 --> 18:32.110
Something smells delicious!

18:32.195 --> 18:34.613
Well, that's it. This
place ain't for me.

18:34.697 --> 18:38.450
Well, we're not giving up. We're
going to cure you of drinking.

18:38.534 --> 18:43.079
Look, I worked long and hard,
got rich, and now I'm retired.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.665
Why shouldn't I be able
to drink all I want?

18:45.750 --> 18:48.251
Well, I don't know. I just naturally

18:48.336 --> 18:50.462
assumed it was some of my business.

18:50.546 --> 18:54.007
Well, I don't see how it is.
Nobody's even told me your name yet.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.969
I'm still not giving up on Buck.

18:58.054 --> 19:01.556
There must be some
harebrained, half-assed way...

19:01.641 --> 19:02.641
This just in.

19:02.725 --> 19:06.478
A robbery is in progress at the
National Bank of Springfield.

19:06.562 --> 19:10.524
The robbers are equipped with the latest
in high-tech weaponry and body armor.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.609
Stay back, coppers!

19:15.530 --> 19:18.073
Uh, please, everyone! Stay away!

19:18.157 --> 19:22.911
We don't want anyone to
be a hero! A hero! A hero!

19:24.080 --> 19:26.164
Get me Buck McCoy!

19:26.249 --> 19:27.874
Dad, I'm on the line!

19:28.501 --> 19:32.295
Here you go. Just stop this bank
robbery and you'll be a hero again.

19:32.421 --> 19:36.007
I'll wait in the car. Are
you crazy? I'm a movie cowboy.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.301
And you're no Howard Hawks.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.511
That hurts.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.513
But I just have one question.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.516
Do you want my son to
be disappointed in you?

19:46.227 --> 19:47.310
Fine.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.232
You don't need that.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.486
Way to go, Buck. I feel
my faith growing anew!

19:56.571 --> 19:58.697
Better get rid of this, too.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.408
Not to mention this.

20:02.118 --> 20:05.287
Whoa! There's nothing wrong
with a little "hey-hey!"

20:07.957 --> 20:12.460
Fun's over, boys! Drop
the hardware and mosey!

20:14.505 --> 20:18.675
I'm firing at the lasso, but the
bullets just go through the middle!

20:18.801 --> 20:20.385
It's the ultimate weapon.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.192
Wow. That sure made us look bad.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.403
Slink away, boys. Slink away.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.117
Buck, you're my hero again.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.077
Aren't you forgetting someone?

20:46.454 --> 20:51.082
Well, there's Krusty, Itchy, Scratchy,
Poochie, America's Fire Fighters,

20:51.167 --> 20:52.250
and then you, Dad.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.087
And don't you forget it.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.839
Oh!

20:58.341 --> 21:02.093
Goodbye, Bart! Never bother me again!

21:03.305 --> 21:09.296
