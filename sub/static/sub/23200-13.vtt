03:12.598 --> 03:14.555
We have a pickup to make.

03:39.378 --> 03:40.879
Take her down.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.385
When they fished him out of the ocean...

05:43.468 --> 05:46.513
he was babbling about being chased
by a flying saucer.

05:46.889 --> 05:50.687
First time the Russians ever used
that excuse for violating U.S. airspace.

05:50.769 --> 05:51.854
How is he doing?

05:51.937 --> 05:54.649
Still babbling. "Traumatized"
is the word the doctors used.

05:54.732 --> 05:56.568
He's listed as satisfactory.

05:56.651 --> 05:58.152
What kind of security have you got?

05:58.236 --> 05:59.655
Twenty-four hour surveillance.

05:59.738 --> 06:02.324
All visitors, all calls carefully screened.

06:02.408 --> 06:04.326
- Hospital's cooperating nicely.
- Good.

06:04.410 --> 06:07.998
So far nothing unusual.
Still no word from the Soviets?

06:08.455 --> 06:09.624
Are you kidding?

06:09.708 --> 06:12.669
When one of their jets
takes a nosedive off Catalina Island...

06:12.752 --> 06:13.962
it's gonna be a while...

06:14.045 --> 06:16.550
before they come out
with an official statement.

06:16.633 --> 06:19.678
Have all arrangements for your stay
in Long Beach been made?

06:19.761 --> 06:21.638
Yes. Thanks very much.

06:21.722 --> 06:24.183
There is one thing you can do for me.

06:24.266 --> 06:27.854
I'm expecting a call from one of our agents
on assignment in Los Angeles.

06:27.937 --> 06:31.107
If you could leave a message
at my hotel for her to call me here...

06:31.191 --> 06:32.276
I'd appreciate it.

06:32.359 --> 06:35.779
- "Her"? What's the name?
- Prince. Diana Prince.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.085
Hi.

07:53.830 --> 07:56.083
Diana told me to tell you she had to leave.

07:56.165 --> 07:58.503
It was something about your manners.

08:45.767 --> 08:49.145
This really hasn't developed
into a very good day, has it?

08:51.522 --> 08:53.483
And your friend's pictures...

08:56.195 --> 08:57.863
didn't turn out too well.

08:58.072 --> 09:00.034
You're about to tell me...

09:01.494 --> 09:03.204
everything you know.

09:14.049 --> 09:15.468
Major Gorovkin?

09:17.554 --> 09:18.763
Steve?

09:19.430 --> 09:21.432
I got your message and came right over.

09:21.516 --> 09:22.560
Good.

09:22.643 --> 09:24.812
Any luck with the stolen laser equipment?

09:24.895 --> 09:28.818
I was tailing a man who I'm sure
was on his way to wherever it was hidden.

09:28.901 --> 09:33.239
But unfortunately I was diverted
by some thug who hardly knew his name...

09:33.322 --> 09:36.242
let alone anything
about stolen laser equipment.

09:36.325 --> 09:39.162
He's your close encounter victim?

09:41.414 --> 09:42.834
He's your new assignment.

09:42.917 --> 09:45.752
We unscrambled his radio conversation
with a Russian base...

09:45.836 --> 09:47.464
just before he went down.

09:47.547 --> 09:50.677
He said he was jettisoning cargo.
Then he bailed out.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.221
- Cargo?
- He was carrying something.

09:53.305 --> 09:56.516
Hopefully, we'll find out what that is
when we recover the plane.

10:00.353 --> 10:03.275
We're not gonna find anything more
about the babbling brook.

10:03.357 --> 10:04.984
I beg your pardon.

10:05.777 --> 10:09.364
Yuri Gorovkin is an experienced
and well-respected pilot.

10:09.447 --> 10:11.117
He's obviously in a state of shock.

10:11.199 --> 10:13.911
Or perhaps he's well respected
for his acting ability.

10:13.994 --> 10:15.956
You must be Colonel Trevor.

10:17.082 --> 10:20.294
I'm Vladimir Zukov,
Soviet military attachÃ©.

10:20.377 --> 10:22.837
I'm Diana Prince. I'm with the IADC, also.

10:24.423 --> 10:28.304
I wish to make clear
that I'm just as anxious as both of you...

10:28.387 --> 10:30.681
to clear up this terrible mistake.

10:30.765 --> 10:33.392
- That's what-
- Colonel? Phone call for you, sir.

10:33.768 --> 10:36.687
Excuse me, Diana.
I'll be at a desk right outside.

10:36.812 --> 10:39.943
That's what it is. A mistake.

10:40.235 --> 10:42.154
Of course it is a mistake.

10:42.238 --> 10:44.281
Maj. Gorovkin had no instructions...

10:44.365 --> 10:47.493
to violate the air territory
of the United States.

10:47.994 --> 10:50.119
Would you tell me if he did?

10:51.537 --> 10:53.792
I, like you, have a job to do.

10:59.173 --> 11:01.174
And if we were honest with each other...

11:01.259 --> 11:03.928
both of our jobs would be a little easier,
wouldn't they?

11:04.011 --> 11:08.268
Maj. Gorovkin inadvertently
strayed over American territory...

11:09.061 --> 11:12.398
to avoid collision with a UFO.

11:12.647 --> 11:14.900
Your own military said so itself.

11:14.984 --> 11:19.197
They also said that he referred to a cargo.

11:21.950 --> 11:23.035
What was he carrying?

11:23.118 --> 11:26.205
I have not been provided
with such information.

11:26.955 --> 11:31.545
Mr. Zukov, I really don't care
how embarrassed your government...

11:31.628 --> 11:34.673
or my government is
about what's happened here.

11:35.007 --> 11:38.678
My main concern are the people
that our governments represent.

11:39.597 --> 11:42.766
Is there something that we should know
about that cargo?

11:42.850 --> 11:44.018
Off the record.

11:44.101 --> 11:47.271
I've told you everything I can, Miss Prince.

11:49.523 --> 11:52.485
No doubt our respective investigations...

11:52.569 --> 11:55.740
will keep us bumping heads
for the next few days.

11:55.823 --> 11:59.661
Since we'll be working together,
in a sense...

11:59.745 --> 12:04.041
perhaps, you would like to have dinner
with me one evening?

12:05.292 --> 12:06.921
I don't think so.

12:09.047 --> 12:12.801
I suppose your people
keep the IADC pretty busy.

12:15.930 --> 12:17.223
No.

12:17.307 --> 12:20.938
Actually it's your people
who keep the IADC pretty busy.

12:21.019 --> 12:22.229
Good day.

13:07.740 --> 13:10.118
Such an innocent-looking piece of metal.

13:10.954 --> 13:14.791
It's hard to believe
it carries such a high price tag, isn't it?

13:35.481 --> 13:38.277
All that glitters is not gold, indeed.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.702
Wait a minute. I'm getting a reading.

13:45.786 --> 13:47.162
It's leaking.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.753
Radiation level's 5.2 in there.

13:54.337 --> 13:57.006
Just three points below high risk.

13:58.258 --> 14:00.427
There's no visible damage.

14:01.471 --> 14:06.018
So there's really no reason
to disappoint our guests, is there?

14:12.692 --> 14:15.028
Unfortunately,
there's nothing to be done until...

14:15.112 --> 14:17.448
that Russian pilot decides
to do some talking.

14:17.531 --> 14:21.201
My orders are to stay put
until this incident is all cleared up.

14:21.284 --> 14:24.580
Poor you. Stuck in Southern California
for the duration.

14:25.873 --> 14:27.709
I'm afraid it's poor you, too.

14:27.793 --> 14:30.421
Because your orders
are to do all the legwork.

14:31.005 --> 14:33.175
Until things break here...

14:33.259 --> 14:36.262
I'd like to finish up a little legwork
on my former assignment.

14:36.345 --> 14:37.680
Going back to that warehouse?

14:37.763 --> 14:40.809
Yeah. I got the feeling I was this far...

14:40.892 --> 14:43.979
from figuring out
what's behind those laser thefts.

14:44.688 --> 14:46.524
You gonna need some backup?

14:46.606 --> 14:49.317
No, I've become
pretty self-reliant these days.

14:50.403 --> 14:51.571
All right.

14:52.364 --> 14:54.653
- Just be careful.
- I will.

15:23.358 --> 15:27.816
You'll be relieved to know that Mr. Brown
has arrived safely without incident.

15:27.900 --> 15:31.066
Mr. Brown, I believe you already know
Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones.

15:31.150 --> 15:35.524
Our last encounter left me holding
an IOU signed by Mr. Jones...

15:35.608 --> 15:37.731
for 100,000 Turkish lira.

15:38.064 --> 15:39.731
And it wasn't until Istanbul...

15:39.814 --> 15:43.981
that you finally settled
a 50,000 franc due bill with me, huh?

15:46.106 --> 15:48.147
Let's get down to business.

15:48.230 --> 15:51.688
Mr. Brown's dramatic entrance
has set us behind schedule.

15:51.772 --> 15:53.563
As he usually does.

15:57.439 --> 16:00.897
Nothing like a get-together
between old friends. Gentlemen.

16:18.186 --> 16:21.770
The subject of today's bidding:
one nuclear warhead...

16:21.853 --> 16:26.227
recovered from a Russian plane en route
to a certain Central American country.

16:26.561 --> 16:29.684
Now the question is,
which of you gentlemen...

16:29.768 --> 16:33.185
and the parties you, today, represent...

16:34.018 --> 16:35.893
will become its proud new owners.

16:35.976 --> 16:40.559
The question is, Como, is it worth the
extraordinary price you've placed on it?

16:40.642 --> 16:43.100
Have you ever heard
my merchandise being inferior?

16:43.184 --> 16:46.351
No. Nor would we want
your reputation to be ruined.

16:47.142 --> 16:50.100
That's why we intend
to do some checking.

16:52.308 --> 16:53.683
Excuse me.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.639
Be my guests.

17:13.388 --> 17:16.847
There's no question.
This came from the Rostrov plant.

17:17.348 --> 17:19.097
It's the real thing.

17:28.887 --> 17:32.637
With this warhead
serving as a prototype...

17:32.720 --> 17:36.554
my backer should become competitors
in the arms race within a year.

17:37.054 --> 17:41.178
Which is why my backers have no
intention of allowing you to purchase it.

17:42.762 --> 17:47.135
I detect a note of over-confidence
in your voice, Mr. Brown.

17:48.177 --> 17:51.926
Perhaps you and our hosts
have already made a deal?

17:52.135 --> 17:53.302
I come prepared.

17:53.384 --> 17:56.384
I have seen the cash down payment
each of you brought with you.

17:56.468 --> 17:58.926
And I'm satisfied you are all prepared.

17:59.009 --> 18:02.760
Of course, the true test lies ahead.
The bidding.

18:07.550 --> 18:08.884
Gentlemen.

21:02.325 --> 21:04.491
Don't you know
what a locked door means, lady?

21:04.574 --> 21:06.866
- No trespassing.
- You got it.

21:07.365 --> 21:10.241
I guess there's only one thing for me to do.

21:10.325 --> 21:12.200
- What's that?
- Leave.

21:14.657 --> 21:16.614
- How?
- Well...

21:23.198 --> 21:24.572
Like this.

21:52.527 --> 21:55.611
It's all right, Wonder Woman.
I've got this one.

22:36.731 --> 22:40.023
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

23:03.896 --> 23:06.938
I expected Miss Prince to be in here.

23:07.812 --> 23:11.645
Diana had a feeling that she'd be
in over her head, so she sent me.

23:14.019 --> 23:17.395
She didn't tell me she was working
with Wonder Woman.

23:17.478 --> 23:20.269
Our alliance is strictly an informal one.

23:22.436 --> 23:26.019
- What have you found?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.434
- That's Russian, isn't it?
- Yes, it's...

23:33.185 --> 23:35.934
It appears to be a map of some kind.

23:36.559 --> 23:38.808
A flight plan, I believe...

23:38.892 --> 23:41.142
filed in Vladivostock.

23:41.226 --> 23:45.516
Final destination appears to be
somewhere in Central America.

23:47.266 --> 23:50.558
I'm really indebted to you,
Wonder Woman.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.474
Let's just hope
you won't be needing me again.

24:13.056 --> 24:14.472
Here we go.

24:14.555 --> 24:16.764
All I wanted
was a grilled cheese sandwich.

24:16.847 --> 24:18.764
Eat up. You got a lot of work ahead of you.

24:18.846 --> 24:20.347
What did you find out?

24:20.430 --> 24:21.930
For openers, Captain Louie...

24:22.013 --> 24:23.930
whose name was on that strip of photos...

24:24.013 --> 24:26.346
Apparently, he has
a lot of underground connections.

24:26.429 --> 24:27.720
This amusement park he runs...

24:27.803 --> 24:30.929
is just a convenient cover
for his smuggling operations.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.304
You want some fries?

24:32.387 --> 24:34.929
- No, thanks. Just the grilled cheese.
- Okay.

24:35.012 --> 24:39.094
He ties in with the laser equipment
that you've been trying to track down...

24:39.178 --> 24:40.595
in more ways than one.

24:40.678 --> 24:44.678
- Remember Sheldon Como?
- Como, the government scientist.

24:45.636 --> 24:48.760
He's the guy who developed
most of the data and equipment...

24:48.843 --> 24:51.426
the government's using
in their holography experiments.

24:51.510 --> 24:53.426
Didn't he defect or something?

24:54.092 --> 24:57.760
He disappeared five years ago.
But I think he just changed jobs.

24:57.843 --> 25:01.426
He went from laser experimentation
to black-market smuggling.

25:01.510 --> 25:05.675
It's been rumored that he's made billions
on illegal sales of one kind or another.

25:05.759 --> 25:09.926
So we've got the black market,
stolen laser equipment...

25:10.259 --> 25:12.591
and missing cargo
from a downed Russian plane.

25:12.674 --> 25:14.758
The red ribbon
that ties them all together...

25:14.840 --> 25:17.882
could be what the field office
just picked up off the grapevine.

25:17.965 --> 25:19.298
You want a shake?

25:20.090 --> 25:21.423
The red ribbon, Steve.

25:21.508 --> 25:25.673
Early this morning, an atomic weapon
went up for bids on the black market.

25:25.757 --> 25:27.632
Probably a nuclear warhead.

25:27.715 --> 25:29.465
Anyway, it's now up for grabs...

25:29.548 --> 25:32.380
by people representing
various international interests.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.923
And, according to the grapevine...

25:34.006 --> 25:37.506
they're prepared to pay seven-digit
down payments in U.S. currency.

25:37.589 --> 25:40.922
Which means the bidding
must be taking place right here.

25:41.005 --> 25:43.671
Ã la Captain Louie, no doubt.

25:45.421 --> 25:48.254
Steve, the only thing to do
is to get in on that bidding.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.837
I think I can get a ticket in.

25:51.421 --> 25:53.629
- But I'll need a cover.
- Good.

25:53.962 --> 25:55.879
Remember the gal
who was running guns...

25:55.962 --> 25:58.587
for the revolution
in South America last July?

25:58.669 --> 26:03.086
Trouble is, she was just executed
by guerrillas in the Andes, wasn't she?

26:03.169 --> 26:05.668
That was only a rumor.
It was never confirmed.

26:05.752 --> 26:08.086
Diana, I think that's your best bet.

26:08.169 --> 26:11.710
In the black market circles
she was called Mrs. Fox.

26:12.211 --> 26:14.835
You and I will do the same
double-agent crew routine...

26:14.919 --> 26:16.919
that we did in Amsterdam last spring.

26:17.002 --> 26:21.293
Only this time, we're gonna need
more green stuff. A lot more.

26:21.459 --> 26:25.251
The field office is taking care
of that little detail as we speak.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.210
- Too bad about one thing, though.
- What's that?

26:28.293 --> 26:29.958
If both of us go undercover...

26:30.042 --> 26:32.957
poor Mr. Zukov
is not gonna have anybody to tail.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.665
Cold war is hell, isn't it?

26:36.083 --> 26:37.833
Don't forget, Steve.

26:38.416 --> 26:41.916
- It'll get worse before it gets better.
- Right.

26:58.081 --> 27:00.246
- Mrs. Fox?
- Yes.

27:00.789 --> 27:03.664
My assistant tells me
you want to talk to me.

27:03.789 --> 27:07.038
It certainly cannot be
to complain about our equipment.

27:07.580 --> 27:10.996
The sights on this rifle are a little off...

27:11.080 --> 27:12.996
which you may or may not know.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.497
But as you can see, I've compensated.

27:17.246 --> 27:19.496
Then you have nothing to complain about.

27:19.579 --> 27:21.994
Except for the prizes.

27:22.078 --> 27:24.744
You see, I had in mind something bigger.

27:24.827 --> 27:26.078
Much bigger.

27:26.161 --> 27:29.119
One that doesn't say "made in Taiwan"...

27:29.786 --> 27:31.619
but "made in Russia. "

27:32.286 --> 27:35.410
Such prizes can be very, very expensive.

27:37.410 --> 27:42.410
As you've probably heard,
I always come prepared, Captain Louie.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.785
What I didn't hear
is that you were interested in...

27:46.451 --> 27:48.367
today's game.

27:50.492 --> 27:53.492
It's others who are interested.
Me, I'm just a go-between.

27:53.575 --> 27:56.492
Who, right now,
would like to have her picture taken.

27:56.575 --> 28:00.407
I've always wondered
when I'd have the pleasure, Mrs. Fox.

28:01.491 --> 28:03.532
Next door to the arcade...

28:03.907 --> 28:05.908
by the pinball machines.

28:06.699 --> 28:09.699
It says "out of order,"
but what do they know?

28:10.449 --> 28:12.199
Thank you, Captain.

28:19.073 --> 28:21.739
Mike, get Como on the phone.

29:15.858 --> 29:17.566
Take it easy, lady.

29:18.483 --> 29:20.566
We're just supposed to check you out.

29:21.067 --> 29:23.317
You can do your checking from there.

29:24.608 --> 29:28.066
Okay, okay. You look fine.

29:29.441 --> 29:31.233
Except for the piece.

29:43.855 --> 29:46.357
- Better?
- Lots.

30:04.937 --> 30:08.311
- $9,600,000.
- $9,750,000.

30:09.645 --> 30:13.395
This is insanity.
None of us intended to go this high.

30:23.895 --> 30:27.726
I'm Sheldon Como, your host
on this little shopping adventure.

30:27.810 --> 30:30.351
- This is Mr. Lucas.
- Mrs. Fox.

30:30.935 --> 30:33.684
It's an honor, Mrs. Fox.
And, I might add, a pleasure.

30:33.767 --> 30:36.768
- Where are the others?
- First things first.

30:37.102 --> 30:39.684
There is the matter
of a small down payment...

30:39.768 --> 30:42.309
should yours prove to be the highest bid.

30:43.059 --> 30:45.100
The money is in Long Beach.

30:45.183 --> 30:48.350
I wasn't about to bring it with me.
No offence.

30:48.599 --> 30:51.891
None taken. Where in Long Beach?

30:54.807 --> 30:59.139
The Old Nautical Shop. A colleague of
mine is there, waiting to hear from you.

31:00.473 --> 31:04.015
Take someone with you.
Call me when you're sure all is well...

31:04.099 --> 31:05.723
which, of course, includes...

31:05.807 --> 31:09.431
I hope that's all he is, a colleague,
not a friend or lover.

31:09.889 --> 31:12.014
He means nothing to me.

31:12.098 --> 31:13.680
But there is a password.

31:13.764 --> 31:17.180
Tell him, "It'll get worse
before it gets better. "

31:18.013 --> 31:20.471
He'll play dumb until he hears that.

31:28.596 --> 31:32.137
Then he'll play dumb forever.

31:34.470 --> 31:37.969
- When do I meet my competition?
- After I hear from Lucas.

31:38.303 --> 31:41.762
Once we've dispensed with that formality,
I'll introduce you.

31:41.845 --> 31:44.177
Mr. Jones is here,
Mr. Brown, and Mr. Smith...

31:44.260 --> 31:46.968
with whom, I believe,
you've had some dealings.

31:47.052 --> 31:48.468
Mr. Smith?

31:53.344 --> 31:56.176
Mr. Smith. Of course.

31:56.510 --> 31:58.093
Yes, I know him well.

32:18.049 --> 32:20.007
$9,800,000.

32:21.174 --> 32:22.715
$10,000,000.

32:23.256 --> 32:25.048
$10,150,000.

32:25.465 --> 32:27.673
$11,300,000.

32:28.631 --> 32:32.090
Your backers are indeed determined
to obtain that warhead.

32:32.173 --> 32:34.507
The question is, how determined?

32:36.130 --> 32:37.630
Why prolong this?

32:37.713 --> 32:41.421
Why don't we all simply say
how much we are able to spend?

32:41.505 --> 32:44.880
Is this your way of telling us
you've reached your limit, Mr. Smith?

32:58.004 --> 32:59.754
Can I help you, gentlemen?

33:00.919 --> 33:02.252
Maybe.

33:03.211 --> 33:06.669
I hope you can be a little more specific.
I was just about ready to close.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.503
It's been a hard day. Lots of hassles.
You understand.

33:10.752 --> 33:13.502
"It'll get worse before it gets better. "

33:15.460 --> 33:17.377
I think I can help you.

33:17.460 --> 33:19.751
Been wondering
when you guys were gonna show up.

33:19.834 --> 33:22.834
- Something in green, wasn't it?
- Sounds about right.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.418
Right this way.

33:41.749 --> 33:43.790
I think you'll be pleased.

33:45.832 --> 33:47.916
You're right. We're pleased.

33:54.747 --> 33:55.997
Lucas?

33:56.080 --> 34:00.580
I'm standing in front of what looks like
$5 million worth of fun tickets.

34:02.330 --> 34:05.330
So, the lady and her backers
are legitimate.

34:05.413 --> 34:06.829
Looks that way.

34:07.205 --> 34:09.829
Count the money. What of her emissary?

34:10.204 --> 34:11.789
Just about to close up shop.

34:11.871 --> 34:13.163
Make sure you tidy up.

34:13.246 --> 34:15.704
- And get back here with the money.
- Yes, sir.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.246
Start counting.

34:20.036 --> 34:22.452
Gentlemen, the waiting is over.
We can proceed.

34:22.536 --> 34:24.870
May I introduce my latest guest?

34:27.953 --> 34:29.369
Mrs. Fox.

34:35.576 --> 34:36.828
Gentlemen.

34:36.911 --> 34:39.536
What are you trying to pull, Como?

34:40.284 --> 34:44.534
As host, I can invite whomever
I please to these little get-togethers.

34:44.618 --> 34:47.574
- But this is not Mrs. Fox.
- I beg your pardon?

34:52.283 --> 34:54.534
I knew I smelled a set-up.

34:54.741 --> 34:59.157
This is a trick to drive the bidding
up even higher. Admit it, Como.

35:00.074 --> 35:02.658
I see you haven't changed
your act, Mr. Smith.

35:02.741 --> 35:05.282
Still trying to discredit your competitors.

35:08.949 --> 35:12.489
He tried the same thing in Sydney.
Unsuccessfully, I might add.

35:12.572 --> 35:16.781
I'm telling you that this is not Mrs. Fox.

35:17.281 --> 35:22.030
What he's saying does tie in with a rumor
I heard concerning your health.

35:22.863 --> 35:25.072
- Which is?
- That you're dead.

35:29.780 --> 35:33.279
Which might've been true,
had one of my sympathizers...

35:33.363 --> 35:37.903
not removed these from my back
after I was left for dead.

35:38.195 --> 35:40.737
Few people know
that the guerilla armies of the Andes...

35:40.821 --> 35:43.945
use homemade ammunition which,
when fired from their own weapons...

35:44.028 --> 35:46.611
make their bullets extremely identifiable.

35:46.694 --> 35:48.903
They contain large amounts of silver...

35:48.986 --> 35:52.986
which is partly the reason why
I decided to make a bracelet out of them.

35:53.070 --> 35:55.319
We should all carry reminders...

35:55.403 --> 35:58.944
of the very real possibility of death,
right, Mrs. Fox?

35:59.194 --> 36:00.819
Right, Mr. Como.

36:00.902 --> 36:02.902
She's working with him.

36:03.818 --> 36:08.776
Don't you understand this is a ploy
to make us bid higher for that warhead?

36:08.859 --> 36:10.526
Please, Mr. Smith.

36:10.942 --> 36:15.691
If you're this afraid of competition,
you should try another career.

36:16.191 --> 36:18.442
Raising petunias, perhaps.

36:18.526 --> 36:21.067
Don't you understand we're being tricked?

36:21.150 --> 36:24.400
And I, for one,
refuse to be manipulated like this.

36:24.483 --> 36:29.109
If you're giving us a choice between
her company and yours...

36:30.357 --> 36:32.315
I needn't tell you the outcome.

36:32.399 --> 36:37.231
Gentlemen, we will resume the bidding
as soon as Mrs. Fox's deposit arrives.

36:37.398 --> 36:39.398
You'll pay for this, Como.

36:39.481 --> 36:41.940
When my countrymen hear
what you've done to me...

36:42.023 --> 36:43.856
I guarantee you will pay.

36:43.940 --> 36:46.481
Mr. Smith, shut up.

36:51.855 --> 36:54.398
Let me show you
what you'll be bidding on.

37:00.396 --> 37:03.561
Five million on the nose.
A pleasure doing business with you.

37:03.645 --> 37:05.229
Too bad there won't be a next time.

37:05.311 --> 37:07.062
That's true. Hold it.

37:08.521 --> 37:10.187
If you'd be so kind.

37:13.186 --> 37:16.395
You've heard the old expression,
"Turnabout is fair play. "

37:16.978 --> 37:19.394
You, you're going to deliver the money.

37:19.812 --> 37:22.102
And you,
you've just become an insurance policy.

37:22.185 --> 37:24.477
"It gets worse before it gets better. "

37:24.559 --> 37:26.935
That's right.
Too bad you're such a slow learner.

37:27.018 --> 37:28.351
Get moving.

37:32.227 --> 37:33.935
Kelly. Madders.

37:35.851 --> 37:37.059
What's this?

37:37.142 --> 37:39.226
It's your day for surprises,
that's what it is.

37:39.309 --> 37:41.266
Take him in the back room.

37:42.392 --> 37:45.518
Call Edwards in the mobile unit.
If he has a feed, too...

37:45.600 --> 37:48.724
we'd have no trouble triangulating
the money's position.

38:00.140 --> 38:01.723
All right. Thanks.

38:02.348 --> 38:04.598
According to what Edwards says
and what we see...

38:04.682 --> 38:06.515
he's making a beeline for the ocean.

38:06.597 --> 38:08.098
Diana's at the pier.

38:08.681 --> 38:10.431
Beach house? Boat?

38:18.221 --> 38:21.012
It's really rather pleasant-looking,
isn't it?

38:21.179 --> 38:23.513
Considering the horror it contains...

38:24.179 --> 38:26.179
just waiting to be unleashed.

38:27.346 --> 38:31.012
You're obviously little concerned
about that prospect.

38:32.970 --> 38:35.096
This is my world now.

38:36.054 --> 38:38.970
I honestly don't care
what happens to yours.

38:39.262 --> 38:43.552
One fine day it's going to blow itself
to bits with or without my help.

38:44.135 --> 38:47.051
Someone has arrived.
Must be Lucas with your down payment.

38:47.134 --> 38:49.302
Now we can get on with the bidding.

38:49.386 --> 38:52.260
It's not often one gets the chance
to bid on such an item.

38:52.343 --> 38:55.468
My backers are very anxious
to get their hands on it.

38:55.552 --> 39:00.260
Tell me, how did you
come upon this warhead?

39:03.842 --> 39:07.633
It would be more correct to say
the warhead came upon me.

39:14.508 --> 39:16.632
It isn't Lucas after all.

39:16.715 --> 39:21.215
Mrs. Fox, may I introduce Vladimir Zukov?

39:28.340 --> 39:31.006
We have already met.

39:40.672 --> 39:45.296
You IADC agents turn up
in the most unexpected places.

39:46.046 --> 39:48.295
What? Carl.

39:48.629 --> 39:52.671
I don't know how you conned
your way in here, Miss Prince.

39:53.796 --> 39:55.796
But you are to be commended.

39:55.879 --> 39:58.087
And you're to be commended, Mr. Zukov.

39:58.170 --> 40:01.544
Most double agents
look lousy in business suits.

40:01.627 --> 40:05.670
- She's with the government?
- Most unfortunately for her, yes.

40:08.836 --> 40:10.127
Kill her.

40:11.252 --> 40:13.668
It's not that simple.
Lucas is on his way back.

40:13.751 --> 40:16.460
There's a good chance
the money he's carrying is bugged...

40:16.544 --> 40:18.127
so her people can find us.

40:18.210 --> 40:21.709
- Can't you stop him?
- If I can't, we can outrun him.

40:22.043 --> 40:25.250
Let's move out.
Full speed ahead. Maximum depth.

40:25.333 --> 40:27.666
Maybe next time you'll listen.

40:29.583 --> 40:33.291
One more word, and whatever
happens to her, happens to you.

41:00.871 --> 41:03.288
- Yeah.
- Lucas, there has been a change of plan.

41:03.372 --> 41:05.454
Get rid of the money
and stay away from the dock.

41:05.538 --> 41:06.580
Problem?

41:06.664 --> 41:09.871
Do as I say. Get rid of the money
and stand by for further word.

41:09.955 --> 41:12.122
By the way, you might be followed.
So be careful.

41:12.205 --> 41:13.371
Got it.

41:15.204 --> 41:16.953
Diana is in trouble.

41:17.619 --> 41:20.453
And that's the only clue we've got
as to where she is.

41:30.452 --> 41:32.744
That takes care of one problem.

41:33.327 --> 41:34.953
Now, for the other.

41:35.285 --> 41:36.661
Allow me.

41:37.369 --> 41:39.410
Are you sure you want to do that in here?

41:39.493 --> 41:40.660
She's right.

41:40.743 --> 41:44.784
Bullets have a rather annoying tendency
to ricochet in submarines.

41:44.867 --> 41:48.242
Therefore, my dear,
if you'll step this way, please.

41:49.534 --> 41:52.242
Just when we were
getting to know each other.

41:52.325 --> 41:55.241
I know you just about as well as I want to.

41:55.574 --> 41:58.117
I could say the same thing about you...

41:58.200 --> 42:00.658
except that I'm still curious.

42:01.616 --> 42:03.949
How did you get the warhead?

42:04.282 --> 42:05.699
Illusion.

42:05.782 --> 42:09.532
The research I undertook,
compliments of our government...

42:09.615 --> 42:13.323
went into perfecting the art of illusion.

42:13.407 --> 42:15.572
Now I'm capitalizing on it.

42:15.656 --> 42:18.781
Your research focused on holography.

42:18.863 --> 42:21.780
So the flying saucer the pilot saw
was really a hologram...

42:21.864 --> 42:23.531
you created with lasers.

42:24.781 --> 42:27.364
The illusion of imminent doom
so frightened the man...

42:27.447 --> 42:30.488
that he jettisoned his cargo
right into my lap.

42:30.571 --> 42:33.321
But this, I'm afraid, is no illusion.

42:35.612 --> 42:37.278
Get in, Miss...

42:37.862 --> 42:40.778
- Prince. Diana Prince.
- Indeed.

42:41.487 --> 42:43.070
- In there.
- Yes.

43:11.817 --> 43:13.734
Goodbye, Diana Prince.

43:13.985 --> 43:17.276
The water pressure outside
will crush her instantly.

43:17.359 --> 43:20.149
- Please, please. Please wait.
- For what?

43:20.441 --> 43:22.899
For her to have us all imprisoned?

43:23.400 --> 43:24.942
Get rid of her.

43:38.773 --> 43:41.940
- Care you do the honors?
- Delighted.

44:00.312 --> 44:03.354
There will be no further interruptions,
I assure you.

44:03.437 --> 44:06.812
- Why don't you resume your bidding?
- With pleasure.

44:25.393 --> 44:27.017
What's happening?

44:28.269 --> 44:30.226
Something's in the airlock.

44:33.767 --> 44:35.600
Party's over, boys.

44:49.598 --> 44:50.849
Use this.

45:17.554 --> 45:19.304
Any more toys, Como?

45:20.721 --> 45:21.847
Good.

45:21.929 --> 45:24.804
The Coast Guard must have
a good idea where we are by now.

45:24.887 --> 45:27.887
So we might as well
all head back to Long Beach.

45:48.468 --> 45:49.718
I don't believe it.

45:49.802 --> 45:53.135
Captain Louie ought to be arrested
for defrauding the public as well.

45:53.218 --> 45:56.677
I've never seen rifle sights
so misadjusted in my life.

45:56.885 --> 46:00.385
What did the Soviets
have to say about Mr. Zukov?

46:02.384 --> 46:05.966
I doubt they knew he was working
with Como any more than we did.

46:08.550 --> 46:10.258
What they said about Mr. Zukov...

46:10.341 --> 46:13.590
was exactly what they said
about the whole affair. Nothing.

46:18.590 --> 46:20.756
See what I mean about the sights?

46:21.425 --> 46:24.882
Probably all they're interested in
is getting their warhead back.

46:24.965 --> 46:26.840
They'll get it back eventually.

46:26.923 --> 46:29.173
With a strong reprimand, I would imagine.

46:29.257 --> 46:31.672
And a warning.
That canister was leaking radiation.

46:31.755 --> 46:34.005
What happened to the people in the sub?

46:34.089 --> 46:36.089
They've all been checked out.
They're okay.

46:36.172 --> 46:38.171
Not enough of a dose to hurt anyone.

46:38.255 --> 46:39.921
What do you say we get some dinner?

46:40.004 --> 46:42.838
- Great. Your car or mine?
- Mine. Pick you up in a minute.

46:42.921 --> 46:47.267
All right.

47:33.687 --> 47:38.381
